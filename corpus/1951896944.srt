1
00:00:51,101 --> 00:00:55,197
<i>I still remember it</i>
<i>as if it were yesterday</i>

2
00:00:58,108 --> 00:01:03,808
<i>A cold and frosty November morning</i>
<i>when Master Richie came into the world</i>

3
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,012
I have a son.

4
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:17,852
<i>And I,</i>
<i>Herbert Arthur Runcible Cadbury</i>

5
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:22,396
<i>born in the tradition of service</i>

6
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,665
<i>was to become</i>
<i>his gentleman's gentleman</i>

7
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:29,862
<i>or as you Americans would say,</i>
<i>his butler</i>

8
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:35,975
<i>Richie Rich was the long-awaited</i>
<i>first child of Richard and Regina Rich</i>

9
00:01:36,146 --> 00:01:40,674
<i>and at 7 pounds, 6 ounces,</i>
<i>was immediately proclaimed</i>

10
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,081
<i>the wealthiest baby in the world</i>

11
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:52,751
<i>Truly, Master Richie was born into</i>
<i>a life of great wealth and privilege</i>

12
00:01:53,263 --> 00:01:59,498
<i>and yet, he was assuredly</i>
<i>his parents' most valued treasure</i>

13
00:02:02,138 --> 00:02:04,936
Can you say, "Wall Street"?

14
00:02:05,608 --> 00:02:07,599
"Wall Street"?

15
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:12,007
- Can you say, "blue chip"?
- Bunches and bunches of money.

16
00:02:12,182 --> 00:02:16,084
- That's how much mommy loves you.
- Can you say, "convertible debenture"?

17
00:02:17,253 --> 00:02:19,483
<i>From the day he left his cradle</i>

18
00:02:19,656 --> 00:02:22,716
<i>I undertook to show him</i>
<i>all that was good in life</i>

19
00:02:22,926 --> 00:02:26,487
<i>And I am delighted to report</i>
<i>that never was there a child</i>

20
00:02:26,663 --> 00:02:28,756
<i>with a sweeter disposition</i>

21
00:02:29,432 --> 00:02:33,266
<i>or a more spirited sense of play</i>

22
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,100
<i>Although his father,</i>
<i>the senior Richard Rich</i>

23
00:02:37,273 --> 00:02:42,108
<i>spent countless hours in his office,</i>
<i>overseeing his vast business empire</i>

24
00:02:42,278 --> 00:02:44,508
Rich to buy 100 million acres of jungle.

25
00:02:44,681 --> 00:02:49,880
<i>he still found time to share</i>
<i>simple pleasures with his son</i>

26
00:02:50,053 --> 00:02:52,521
Thank you, Cadbury.

27
00:02:54,457 --> 00:02:55,822
Go and build it anyway.

28
00:02:55,992 --> 00:02:59,894
<i>As he grew, Master Richie</i>
<i>developed a keen interest in sports</i>

29
00:03:00,697 --> 00:03:03,598
Just a minute. Great toss, son.

30
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:09,562
- Beep beep, coming through.
- <i>He had everything a boy could want</i>

31
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:11,366
<i>Although at the age of 3

32
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:15,602
<i>his driving skills</i>
<i>left something to be desired</i>

33
00:03:17,714 --> 00:03:21,047
We have to have our Arab friends
understand that. Just a minute.

34
00:03:21,217 --> 00:03:23,014
Nice throw, slugger.

35
00:03:23,186 --> 00:03:28,954
<i>With baseball, however, he displayed</i>
<i>a quite precocious talent</i>

36
00:03:29,325 --> 00:03:30,553
Next Tuesday, right.

37
00:03:33,563 --> 00:03:36,589
<i>which, as the years progressed</i>

38
00:03:38,601 --> 00:03:42,435
<i>became more than</i>
<i>just a favorite pastime</i>

39
00:03:48,044 --> 00:03:50,478
Not bad. Let's try this this time.

40
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,648
I want you to get the back elbow up.

41
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:55,648
That a way. Get the bat right here.
Shoulders square.

42
00:03:55,852 --> 00:03:58,343
Nice level swing.
Keep your eye on the baseball.

43
00:03:58,521 --> 00:04:01,581
okay, pitch. Put some heat on it this time.

44
00:04:06,596 --> 00:04:08,257
That's it.

45
00:04:09,966 --> 00:04:11,695
Nice hitting, Richie.

46
00:04:14,704 --> 00:04:16,968
Sorry, Charles!

47
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,269
Good clubbing, Master Richie.
You're scoring loads of points.

48
00:04:21,444 --> 00:04:23,912
They're called runs, Cadbury. Runs.

49
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,447
of course. But I'm afraid
we must run, sir.

50
00:04:27,617 --> 00:04:30,882
- Can I have just one more inning?
- That really isn't possible.

51
00:04:32,488 --> 00:04:35,855
- Thank you, Mr. Jackson.
- You're welcome, Richie. Any time.

52
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,617
All right, pack it all up.

53
00:04:38,394 --> 00:04:42,387
<i>In addition to his life of fun and games,</i>
<i>of luxury and privilege</i>

54
00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:46,929
<i>Master Richie was obliged to undertake</i>
<i>responsibilities far beyond those</i>

55
00:04:47,103 --> 00:04:50,561
- <i>of any normal child</i>
- It's a great day for a celebration...

56
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,605
...and a great day for United Tool!

57
00:04:52,775 --> 00:04:55,972
We're gonna wait for Mr. Rich
because he said he'd be here.

58
00:04:56,145 --> 00:04:59,945
Today marks a miracle of sorts
here at United Tool.

59
00:05:00,116 --> 00:05:05,645
This factory, once bankrupt,
and 600 jobs about to disappear forever...

60
00:05:05,822 --> 00:05:09,087
...is now celebrating
a new lease on life...

61
00:05:09,258 --> 00:05:13,718
...thanks to billionaire businessman
and philanthropist Richard Rich.

62
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:18,162
And it looks like Richard Rich
will be arriving here in moments.

63
00:05:44,027 --> 00:05:47,963
Hi. My dad couldn't make it,
so he sent me. I'm Richie.

64
00:05:48,131 --> 00:05:49,894
Fellas, come on. Let me through.

65
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:54,035
Welcome to United Tools, Richie.
My name is Dave Walter, the plant manager.

66
00:05:54,203 --> 00:05:56,330
This is Diane Koscinski, our union rep.

67
00:05:56,506 --> 00:05:58,633
Diane's gonna be making
our presentation.

68
00:05:58,808 --> 00:06:02,039
- We're really glad you could come.
- Me too. This is Cadbury.

69
00:06:02,245 --> 00:06:05,908
- Master Richie's valet.
- oh, a valet? Never met one of your type.

70
00:06:06,082 --> 00:06:09,142
That doesn't altogether
surprise me, madam.

71
00:06:11,487 --> 00:06:13,011
Richie who?

72
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:17,319
What planet you been living on?
Richie Rich, the richest kid in the world.

73
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:23,231
And now, our union rep, Diane Koscinski,
is gonna make our presentation.

74
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,934
Look, Gloria, your mom's
gonna make a speech.

75
00:06:27,103 --> 00:06:30,436
Who cares about speeches?
Let's play some ball.

76
00:06:31,741 --> 00:06:32,901
Fellow workers...

77
00:06:33,076 --> 00:06:35,772
- Gloria, let's go!
- Come on, guys, let's play!

78
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:38,503
It isn't just this company,
it's the whole town.

79
00:06:41,584 --> 00:06:43,245
And on this special morning...

80
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:46,820
...the first day of retooling that's gonna
bring our jobs back...

81
00:06:48,524 --> 00:06:50,924
...we're gonna ask Richie to accept...

82
00:06:51,094 --> 00:06:54,154
...a gold-plated socket wrench set
for his dad.

83
00:06:56,032 --> 00:06:58,125
Thank you, Richie.

84
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,901
on behalf of my dad,
thanks for the wrenches.

85
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:15,112
I know my dad loves socket wrenches.
I know I love socket wrenches.

86
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:20,281
If my mom knew what a socket wrench was,
I'm sure she'd love it too.

87
00:07:25,294 --> 00:07:28,024
I'd like to stay, but I gotta
go do my homework.

88
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,425
It's been real.

89
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,227
Thank you.
I'm sure you'll all join me...

90
00:07:33,402 --> 00:07:36,929
...in giving Richie a big
United Tools thank-you!

91
00:07:37,106 --> 00:07:41,668
I hope you're hungry. We got wieners
on the grill. Make sure you have partners...

92
00:07:41,844 --> 00:07:46,076
...for that egg toss. Plenty of prizes
and you're gonna win one. You are.

93
00:07:46,282 --> 00:07:49,945
This is a great day, and I hope
you all stick around to enjoy it.

94
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:53,020
We've got plenty of games,
plenty of contests.

95
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:55,589
Lots and lots of things for the kids.

96
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,854
Heads up.

97
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:04,561
This area is not secure, sir.
Please return to the helicopter.

98
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:05,962
- I wanted...
- I said...

99
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:08,596
Don't touch him.

100
00:08:10,673 --> 00:08:12,436
Master Richie...

101
00:08:12,642 --> 00:08:16,271
...you have a very busy afternoon,
so we must be on our way.

102
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,075
It's my job to protect him.

103
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:26,847
very well, Mr. Ferguson,
but grab him like that again...

104
00:08:27,023 --> 00:08:29,218
...and you will need protection.

105
00:08:39,468 --> 00:08:42,198
- Poor kid.
- "Poor kid"? What are you talking about?

106
00:08:42,371 --> 00:08:44,271
He's the richest kid in the world.

107
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,432
You don't have children, do you, Dave?

108
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:53,081
Hey, it's taking off.

109
00:08:54,884 --> 00:08:58,342
Man, it must be cool
to have everything.

110
00:09:01,224 --> 00:09:03,556
- Come on, let's play ball.
- Yeah, let's go.

111
00:09:03,726 --> 00:09:06,524
Come on, Gloria, put it over. Let's go.

112
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:11,866
<i>It was then that Richie realized</i>
<i>there was something missing in his life</i>

113
00:09:12,068 --> 00:09:13,763
<i>Something simple</i>

114
00:09:14,337 --> 00:09:17,568
<i>Something money could not buy</i>

115
00:09:20,343 --> 00:09:25,303
Yes, Mrs. Rich, we're flying over
the estate now. We'll be arriving shortly.

116
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:29,975
What? oh, I'm sure he'll be
very happy to hear the news.

117
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:33,781
Master Rich, your father is home
from his business trip.

118
00:09:33,956 --> 00:09:35,287
Great.

119
00:09:57,913 --> 00:10:00,074
- Richie.
- Hello, James. Hobbes.

120
00:10:00,249 --> 00:10:01,876
Welcome home, sir.

121
00:10:05,221 --> 00:10:07,712
Dollar! Come here. Come here.

122
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:11,790
Good. What you doing?
What's going on?

123
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,192
Where's Mom and Dad?

124
00:10:16,299 --> 00:10:18,597
Mount Richmore?

125
00:10:19,835 --> 00:10:22,303
I said we needed
a family portrait, Regina...

126
00:10:23,005 --> 00:10:25,974
...but this?
- It was Rafaella's idea.

127
00:10:26,242 --> 00:10:29,211
She's the artist. I didn't want
to stifle her creativity.

128
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,903
oh, honey, you know me.
I'm all for the arts.

129
00:10:32,248 --> 00:10:34,307
Don't you think
it's a tad pretentious?

130
00:10:34,483 --> 00:10:37,350
our faces 100 feet high?

131
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,613
Wait till Geraldo gets ahold of this.

132
00:10:39,822 --> 00:10:41,687
Richard, dove, you're overreacting.

133
00:10:41,857 --> 00:10:43,722
Say, how'd she get it done so fast?

134
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,155
I've been gone a week.

135
00:10:45,328 --> 00:10:49,492
Professor Keenbean invented a proton
particle maximizer. Something like that.

136
00:10:49,665 --> 00:10:51,724
Anyway, it seems to do the job.

137
00:10:51,934 --> 00:10:53,799
My cheeks are too puffy.

138
00:10:54,136 --> 00:10:57,071
I know, I know, Regina.
I put on a few pounds.

139
00:10:57,273 --> 00:11:00,709
But you have to admit
that I do look puffy up there.

140
00:11:00,943 --> 00:11:04,640
- Dad.
- Hey, slugger. Great to see you.

141
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,677
How you doing, big fella?

142
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:08,940
How was the ribbon-cutting at United?

143
00:11:09,118 --> 00:11:11,245
- Great. They gave you a gift.
- They did?

144
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,287
- Socket wrenches, sir.
- oh, socket wrenches.

145
00:11:14,457 --> 00:11:16,652
Son, I love a good socket wrench.

146
00:11:16,826 --> 00:11:20,193
Dad, while I was there, there were
these kids playing baseball.

147
00:11:20,363 --> 00:11:22,331
- Baseball? Great.
- Yeah. And so...

148
00:11:22,498 --> 00:11:25,490
Excuse me, sir. It's a telephone call,
the president.

149
00:11:25,668 --> 00:11:27,727
- What country?
- This one, sir.

150
00:11:28,671 --> 00:11:32,334
Probably needs another loan.
This won't take long. I'll be right back.

151
00:11:34,643 --> 00:11:36,975
Mom, I was wondering.

152
00:11:37,146 --> 00:11:39,671
If it's okay,
can I invite some kids over?

153
00:11:39,849 --> 00:11:41,214
of course, dear.

154
00:11:41,751 --> 00:11:46,984
A dinner party. Well, you just tell me who
and when and we'll send out the invitations.

155
00:11:47,156 --> 00:11:51,115
- Not a party, Mom. Just something...
- Informal? All right, then.

156
00:11:51,427 --> 00:11:52,826
More like a buffet.

157
00:11:53,095 --> 00:11:55,859
We can use the oak Room.
That room is large enough...

158
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,659
...to accommodate your friends.
- My friends...

159
00:11:59,068 --> 00:12:01,502
They're always busy.
I don't wanna bother them.

160
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,297
Excuse me, Master Richie.

161
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:06,600
It's time for your chemistry lesson
with Professor Keenbean.

162
00:12:06,776 --> 00:12:10,234
- Do I have to?
- A schedule, sir, is like a house of cards.

163
00:12:10,446 --> 00:12:12,846
Take one away and they all
come tumbling down.

164
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,341
- Mom?
- I'm afraid so, Richie.

165
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:18,510
- calculus, well, then, where are we?

166
00:12:18,954 --> 00:12:21,445
<i>In the Rich Manor basement,</i>
<i>you stockholders</i>

167
00:12:21,624 --> 00:12:24,957
<i>are looking at the answer</i>
<i>to the problem of waste management</i>

168
00:12:25,127 --> 00:12:29,530
<i>I, Professor Keenbean here,</i>
<i>with Rich Industries' latest breakthrough:</i>

169
00:12:29,698 --> 00:12:33,725
<i>The subatomic molecular reorganizer!</i>

170
00:12:34,203 --> 00:12:37,730
<i>Useless garbage is broken down</i>
<i>to its basic molecular components</i>

171
00:12:37,907 --> 00:12:41,308
<i>then recombined to form</i>
<i>a whole range of useful new items</i>

172
00:12:41,477 --> 00:12:43,604
<i>from bedpans to bowling balls</i>

173
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:47,010
<i>Hey, need a new bedpan? I know I do</i>

174
00:12:47,216 --> 00:12:52,711
<i>It's quick, it's easy, and in no time at all</i>

175
00:12:52,922 --> 00:12:57,791
<i>we've taken 15 pounds of yesterday's</i>
<i>garbage and transformed it</i>

176
00:12:57,993 --> 00:13:02,487
<i>into a beautiful new bed...</i>
<i>Bowling ball There's one</i>

177
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:06,361
<i>Twins And what family doesn't</i>
<i>need a spare?</i>

178
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:10,130
<i>Here they come Oh, boy, oh, boy</i>

179
00:13:10,506 --> 00:13:11,905
<i>Cut! Cut!</i>

180
00:13:12,074 --> 00:13:13,974
Cut, cut, cut.

181
00:13:15,744 --> 00:13:17,837
Still not working, is it, professor?

182
00:13:18,013 --> 00:13:21,312
Still a few kinks need ironing out,
but not to worry.

183
00:13:21,484 --> 00:13:24,942
- You ready for your chemistry tutorial?
- I'm not in the mood.

184
00:13:25,488 --> 00:13:27,456
What else are you working on?

185
00:13:28,858 --> 00:13:30,826
This one will fry your circuits.

186
00:13:31,026 --> 00:13:35,258
I don't mean to play favorites,
but I'm stuck on this one.

187
00:13:35,431 --> 00:13:36,659
It's a new adhesive.

188
00:13:36,832 --> 00:13:41,201
Ten times stickier than
the strongest adhesive known to man.

189
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:44,237
I call it "Cementia"!

190
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,306
Wait till you see what's over here.

191
00:13:46,475 --> 00:13:49,205
Help me. Help me. Help me.

192
00:14:19,508 --> 00:14:22,568
Hey, Paula! Listen up!

193
00:14:22,878 --> 00:14:25,039
Suck in the cheeks!

194
00:14:25,347 --> 00:14:28,942
- Bad news, I'm afraid, honey.
- Don't tell me you're flying out again.

195
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,813
Tonight after dinner. I'm sorry.

196
00:14:30,986 --> 00:14:33,750
We were supposed
to spend some time together.

197
00:14:33,923 --> 00:14:35,390
How do you put up with me?

198
00:14:35,691 --> 00:14:38,956
Well, you do have $ 70 billion.

199
00:14:39,361 --> 00:14:41,090
Is that the only reason?

200
00:14:44,433 --> 00:14:45,764
No.

201
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,835
You also have a cute butt.

202
00:14:54,376 --> 00:14:55,843
Cadbury, did you hear that?

203
00:14:56,011 --> 00:14:58,878
Indeed, sir. Madam admires your butt.

204
00:14:59,048 --> 00:15:00,606
I'm most delighted for you.

205
00:15:05,087 --> 00:15:08,887
Now, this makes any fabric
instantly impervious.

206
00:15:09,091 --> 00:15:15,087
Dirt proof, stain proof, waterproof, and...

207
00:15:15,264 --> 00:15:17,027
Sherman!

208
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,463
Guess so. Pulled the hair off my head...

209
00:15:22,638 --> 00:15:25,163
Fire in the hole!

210
00:15:35,718 --> 00:15:40,121
And bulletproof. It's not perfect.
It's hell on the dry-cleaning bill.

211
00:15:40,322 --> 00:15:42,017
No kidding.

212
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:44,156
Nice grouping, Sherman.

213
00:15:44,493 --> 00:15:47,758
- What's this, a bee?
- Nope. That's a paperweight.

214
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:50,956
This is a bee.

215
00:15:52,334 --> 00:15:57,203
A hundred bees working overtime
couldn't pollinate like this baby.

216
00:15:57,606 --> 00:15:59,665
Behold Robo-Bee.

217
00:16:00,442 --> 00:16:02,637
Here. Take it for a test flight.

218
00:16:08,684 --> 00:16:10,879
Handles like a dream, huh?

219
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:15,890
Careful. Teams of scientists
have worked day and night...

220
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,822
...developing the latest
in microcircuit technology.

221
00:16:18,994 --> 00:16:20,621
Your afternoon tea, sir.

222
00:16:20,996 --> 00:16:25,160
Millions and millions of dollars
have been spent on this one bee alone.

223
00:16:37,546 --> 00:16:42,506
Come here! Come here, you!
Come! You're gonna need this!

224
00:16:58,967 --> 00:17:03,927
Thirty-seven and a half miles of driveway.
You park in the 5 feet with a puddle.

225
00:17:04,306 --> 00:17:06,171
I'm very sorry, sir.

226
00:17:07,009 --> 00:17:11,469
You're sorry. Well, in that case,
find another job.

227
00:17:13,148 --> 00:17:16,549
Good evening, Mr. van Dough.
It's nice to see you, sir.

228
00:17:16,752 --> 00:17:20,279
I've checked their schedule.
I've got the perfect time...

229
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:23,516
Not now, moron. We'll talk later.

230
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:27,487
Thank you very much,
Mr. van Dough, sir.

231
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,832
- Hello?
- <i>Richie, dear</i>

232
00:17:37,005 --> 00:17:39,269
<i>Are you sure you don't want</i>
<i>to dine with us?</i>

233
00:17:39,441 --> 00:17:42,535
It's okay, Mom.
I really don't like that guy.

234
00:17:43,112 --> 00:17:45,171
That's all right, dear. Neither do I.

235
00:17:46,215 --> 00:17:48,274
But <i>foie de veau</i> is very good for you.

236
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:49,883
Liver is rich in protein.

237
00:17:51,687 --> 00:17:53,245
It's so tasty too.

238
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:56,414
Bye, Mom.

239
00:18:00,295 --> 00:18:02,957
Laurence, let's get back
to what you were saying...

240
00:18:03,132 --> 00:18:05,794
...about our charitable contributions.
- Yes, sir.

241
00:18:05,968 --> 00:18:08,903
I'm all in favor of charity, sir,
but your donations...

242
00:18:09,071 --> 00:18:12,097
...are costing the corporation
a billion dollars a year...

243
00:18:12,274 --> 00:18:14,640
...and I think it's time we asked ourselves:

244
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:17,404
- What are we getting for it?
- What are we getting?

245
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:21,538
We're getting food banks, medical clinics,
shelters for the homeless...

246
00:18:21,717 --> 00:18:24,584
It's Laurence's job
to keep an eye on the bottom line.

247
00:18:24,753 --> 00:18:28,052
Which is also why I have to oppose
the United Tool acquisition.

248
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:31,283
We should be getting rid
of dead weight, not acquire it.

249
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,891
I agree.

250
00:18:33,061 --> 00:18:37,896
- That's why I am getting rid of United Tool.
- Richard! All those people and their jobs!

251
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,000
That is brilliant.
I should've thought of it.

252
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:43,968
We buy the company in bankruptcy.
Level the factories.

253
00:18:44,306 --> 00:18:48,140
No, no, Laurence. I'm keeping
the factory open, like I said.

254
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,871
Then we go in and we bust the unions...

255
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:53,776
...slash benefits,
and then we sell the company.

256
00:18:53,949 --> 00:18:56,474
No. We give it away.

257
00:18:56,819 --> 00:19:00,653
We give it... We give it away.

258
00:19:00,823 --> 00:19:03,519
Absolutely. We modernize it,
of course, and retool.

259
00:19:03,692 --> 00:19:06,183
Then we turn the factory
over to the workers.

260
00:19:06,361 --> 00:19:08,921
Richard, that's a wonderful plan.

261
00:19:10,465 --> 00:19:13,059
Mr. Rich! Mr. Rich!

262
00:19:13,335 --> 00:19:15,769
Mr. Rich. I've done it.

263
00:19:16,171 --> 00:19:20,471
- May I present the Smellmaster.
- Keenbean, that's fantastic.

264
00:19:20,676 --> 00:19:22,701
Richie, come down here and try this.

265
00:19:23,445 --> 00:19:27,211
Glasses help us see better,
and hearing aids help us hear better.

266
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,941
We should have something
to help us smell better.

267
00:19:30,118 --> 00:19:32,552
We do, dear. It's called Chanel.

268
00:19:34,656 --> 00:19:38,387
But the Smellmaster 9000
converts any smell within 20 yards...

269
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,723
...into a digital audio signal.
Here, son. Try it.

270
00:19:44,032 --> 00:19:47,991
<i>Wine, Petite Syrah 1974</i>

271
00:19:49,671 --> 00:19:53,129
<i>Roses Hilversum</i>
<i>Demi-bloom Fresh-cut</i>

272
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:56,401
- Cool.
- That's marvelous.

273
00:19:57,312 --> 00:20:00,873
Foie de veau. <i>Calves' liver</i>

274
00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:04,075
- Richie.
- Better make some adjustments, Dad.

275
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,881
This thing's way out of whack.
Can I be excused? Thank you.

276
00:20:08,223 --> 00:20:09,952
Come on, Dollar. Traitor.

277
00:20:10,425 --> 00:20:14,623
Sir, this is precisely the sort of thing
I'm talking about. Toys like that.

278
00:20:14,897 --> 00:20:17,491
Toys? Good God, man.

279
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,801
To me, it represents...

280
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,562
...good old-fashioned ingenuity
and know-how.

281
00:20:22,738 --> 00:20:24,399
Right, Keenbean?

282
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:29,768
Yes, sir.

283
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,508
I see, sir, you bought a new Monet.

284
00:20:34,683 --> 00:20:36,048
- Spectacular.
- Thanks.

285
00:20:36,218 --> 00:20:39,346
Might I suggest you consider
beefing up the security system?

286
00:20:39,521 --> 00:20:43,719
I don't think that'll be necessary.
After all, all of our real valuables...

287
00:20:43,926 --> 00:20:46,622
...are locked in the Rich family vault.

288
00:20:46,895 --> 00:20:48,123
vault?

289
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,097
The family vault?

290
00:20:50,899 --> 00:20:53,060
Someday I'll give you a tour.

291
00:20:53,635 --> 00:20:55,034
I'd like that.

292
00:20:55,237 --> 00:20:57,228
Again, thank you for a lovely evening.

293
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,735
It is our great pleasure.

294
00:21:00,042 --> 00:21:02,704
- Good night.
- Good night.

295
00:21:04,046 --> 00:21:06,378
- Drive carefully.
- Seat belt.

296
00:21:10,886 --> 00:21:14,378
- Morning, Charles.
- Good morning, Billy.

297
00:21:20,495 --> 00:21:23,089
I gotta get another job.

298
00:21:53,495 --> 00:21:56,362
Morning, sir. It's time.

299
00:21:56,732 --> 00:22:00,224
Rise and shine, Master Richie.
Let's not be a slug abed.

300
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:03,462
You have a very busy schedule
in front of you.

301
00:22:03,972 --> 00:22:06,202
oh, what a beautiful morning.

302
00:22:06,641 --> 00:22:09,872
Come along. You mustn't keep
your personal trainer waiting.

303
00:22:10,045 --> 00:22:13,378
Please tell Arnold I really don't
feel like exercising today.

304
00:22:20,455 --> 00:22:24,016
I hope you don't mind,
but Arnold canceled.

305
00:22:24,192 --> 00:22:27,559
So I'll be filling in today.
My name is Claudia.

306
00:22:30,499 --> 00:22:33,366
And arms to sides. Bend your legs.
Stretch.

307
00:22:33,535 --> 00:22:37,403
And all the way up. And one
more time. Down and back up.

308
00:22:37,572 --> 00:22:40,541
Now stretch to the left. To the right.

309
00:22:40,709 --> 00:22:42,836
one more time.

310
00:22:43,078 --> 00:22:45,512
Cadbury, about Arnold...

311
00:22:45,914 --> 00:22:47,848
Arnold's history, sir.

312
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,945
Now, all the way back down.

313
00:22:50,152 --> 00:22:55,180
Stretch real hard, and up.
And inhale and exhale.

314
00:23:10,772 --> 00:23:12,535
Dadlink on.

315
00:23:15,677 --> 00:23:17,542
Locate Dad.

316
00:23:18,213 --> 00:23:20,408
<i>Hiya, slugger</i>

317
00:23:22,084 --> 00:23:24,882
<i>Locating Dad now</i>

318
00:23:25,921 --> 00:23:31,154
<i>Exact coordinates</i>
<i>will be pinpointed in 11 seconds</i>

319
00:23:31,393 --> 00:23:34,226
<i>10, nine</i>

320
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:37,291
<i>eight, seven</i>

321
00:23:40,735 --> 00:23:41,724
<i>Four</i>

322
00:23:41,903 --> 00:23:45,566
Mr. President, if the government
spends more money than it takes in...

323
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,367
...it goes into debt.

324
00:23:48,477 --> 00:23:50,809
Excuse me, Mr. President.
It's the Dadlink.

325
00:23:50,979 --> 00:23:53,914
- Dadlink?
- It's my personal communication system...

326
00:23:54,082 --> 00:23:55,879
...to my son. It's a prototype.

327
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:57,780
<i>Yes, Richie What is it?</i>

328
00:23:57,953 --> 00:23:59,318
Hi, Dad. What you doing?

329
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:03,322
I'm discussing economic policy
with the president. Is this important?

330
00:24:03,492 --> 00:24:06,552
<i>Well, Dad, I think I'm getting a zit</i>

331
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:08,689
What do you think?

332
00:24:09,131 --> 00:24:10,621
<i>Could we talk later?</i>

333
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,132
<i>Oh Sure, Dad I'm sorry</i>
<i>I'll see you tonight</i>

334
00:24:14,436 --> 00:24:16,802
- <i>Bye</i>
- See you.

335
00:24:16,972 --> 00:24:18,269
Bye.

336
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,699
Congratulations on the zit, sir.

337
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,606
Thank you, Cadbury.

338
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:38,057
And I'll collect you after school, as usual.

339
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:41,059
- Good hunting, sir.
- Thank you, Cadbury.

340
00:24:44,366 --> 00:24:46,926
Let's move on to case study number 12.

341
00:24:47,135 --> 00:24:49,433
Your company is in dire straits.

342
00:24:49,838 --> 00:24:53,433
Sales are down 50 percent
due to stiff price competition.

343
00:24:53,675 --> 00:24:56,371
Dividends are falling.
Stockholders are demanding...

344
00:24:56,545 --> 00:24:58,740
...you step down
as chairman of the board.

345
00:24:58,947 --> 00:25:01,347
Now, here's your problem.

346
00:25:01,516 --> 00:25:04,451
How do you rally the board
of directors to your side...

347
00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:07,213
...and stave off impending bankruptcy?

348
00:25:07,656 --> 00:25:09,214
Reynolds?

349
00:25:11,293 --> 00:25:14,854
I'll have my secretary
get back to you on that one.

350
00:25:15,864 --> 00:25:19,095
Ellsworth, how would you
get the board on your side?

351
00:25:21,169 --> 00:25:22,636
Bribe someone.

352
00:25:23,405 --> 00:25:26,306
Sit down, Ellsworth.

353
00:25:26,975 --> 00:25:29,136
Reginald, what would you do?

354
00:25:29,511 --> 00:25:31,502
What would I do? Simple.

355
00:25:31,913 --> 00:25:34,677
I'd float a rumor
we're the object of a takeover bid.

356
00:25:34,849 --> 00:25:37,374
And as soon as our stock went up, I'd sell.

357
00:25:37,586 --> 00:25:40,885
That's not only unethical,
Reginald, it's illegal.

358
00:25:41,756 --> 00:25:43,553
I'm only 12.

359
00:25:44,526 --> 00:25:46,721
I can't be held legally responsible.

360
00:25:47,596 --> 00:25:49,223
Good point.

361
00:25:52,234 --> 00:25:55,692
Rich, are you and Cuthbert
passing notes again?

362
00:25:55,904 --> 00:25:58,566
- No, sir.
- Cuthbert?

363
00:26:14,022 --> 00:26:16,786
Capital appreciation
is all well and good...

364
00:26:16,958 --> 00:26:19,256
...but not without
a sound growth strategy.

365
00:26:19,561 --> 00:26:23,019
Well, I've only got one word
to say to you: pork bellies.

366
00:26:23,198 --> 00:26:24,756
So, what do you think, Rich?

367
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,096
I think all we ever talk about is money.
We should be having fun.

368
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:31,703
Money is fun.

369
00:26:31,873 --> 00:26:35,206
All I'm saying is, I'm wondering
if you can come this weekend...

370
00:26:35,377 --> 00:26:36,742
...and hang out.

371
00:26:37,078 --> 00:26:39,808
- Hang out?
- Yeah, like normal kids.

372
00:26:39,981 --> 00:26:43,314
You know, you're really acting weird,
Richie. Anyway, no can do.

373
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:46,715
I promised my dad I'd go to Tokyo
for a hostile takeover.

374
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:51,186
- Ellsworth?
- Sorry, trustees' meeting.

375
00:26:51,393 --> 00:26:55,329
Watch your rear, Ellsworth.
First rule of defense.

376
00:26:56,431 --> 00:27:02,336
This is a cappuccino. I asked for a decaf
caffe latte, you incompetent imbecile!

377
00:27:02,504 --> 00:27:04,734
If you can't do the job, you...

378
00:27:07,475 --> 00:27:11,138
First rule of defense, Reg.
Always watch your rear.

379
00:27:20,255 --> 00:27:23,019
Sir, your Latin tutorial has been
moved back an hour.

380
00:27:23,191 --> 00:27:25,284
That gives you time
for a spot of polo.

381
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,087
Then on to your tax law seminar.

382
00:27:27,262 --> 00:27:29,662
oh, and this coming weekend, big treat.

383
00:27:29,864 --> 00:27:34,062
You and your parents are flying to London
to take tea with Her Majesty.

384
00:27:35,937 --> 00:27:37,666
Is something amiss, sir?

385
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:39,932
My friends are too busy
to hang out...

386
00:27:40,108 --> 00:27:42,042
...and now I'm too busy to hang out.

387
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:44,838
You must understand
you're being groomed...

388
00:27:45,013 --> 00:27:49,609
...for a life of wealth and responsibility.
Certain sacrifices must be made.

389
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:52,849
Sacrifices.

390
00:27:55,357 --> 00:27:58,326
Cadbury, I'm changing my schedule.
Bascomb?

391
00:27:58,493 --> 00:27:59,721
- Sir.
- Make a right.

392
00:27:59,894 --> 00:28:02,727
- Yes, sir.
- You...

393
00:28:02,897 --> 00:28:04,990
Come on, pitcher.

394
00:28:07,168 --> 00:28:09,796
You're supposed to hit the ball.

395
00:28:10,004 --> 00:28:11,437
Come on, Gloria.

396
00:28:11,639 --> 00:28:13,834
Cool car.

397
00:28:14,042 --> 00:28:17,170
Hey, guys. Check it out.

398
00:28:17,345 --> 00:28:18,972
Master Richie, please.

399
00:28:19,147 --> 00:28:22,446
You can't play with those children.
I must protest.

400
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:25,347
Cadbury, chill. I'll be fine.

401
00:28:25,754 --> 00:28:28,917
But they probably haven't
even been vaccinated.

402
00:28:29,691 --> 00:28:31,818
Hi, guys. I'm Richie.

403
00:28:31,993 --> 00:28:36,020
- We know who you are.
- What, no chopper?

404
00:28:36,197 --> 00:28:38,563
Dad hardly ever lets me
take the helicopter.

405
00:28:38,733 --> 00:28:41,395
oh, no chopper to go to school?

406
00:28:42,871 --> 00:28:44,930
- What are you doing?
- I was wondering...

407
00:28:45,106 --> 00:28:47,666
...if maybe I can play with you guys?
- Play?

408
00:28:53,548 --> 00:28:55,516
Not!

409
00:28:55,917 --> 00:28:57,714
Come on. Let me hit.

410
00:28:57,886 --> 00:28:59,945
You probably couldn't
hit a beach ball.

411
00:29:00,121 --> 00:29:01,383
I can hit off of you.

412
00:29:06,027 --> 00:29:10,020
You think you're so hot.
Put your money where your mouth is.

413
00:29:10,198 --> 00:29:14,066
- You mean bet?
- Yeah. Five says she puts you away.

414
00:29:14,235 --> 00:29:16,760
Five? How about 10?

415
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:21,270
okay. Seems a little steep,
but 10,000 it is.

416
00:29:23,445 --> 00:29:27,142
No, no, no. Not 10,000.
Ten dollars.

417
00:29:28,283 --> 00:29:30,649
Ten dollars. okay.

418
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:34,053
I was going to McDonald's
with this money.

419
00:29:35,323 --> 00:29:37,416
- Dust him.
- No problem.

420
00:29:37,592 --> 00:29:39,583
Mr. Fancy Pants is going down.

421
00:29:39,761 --> 00:29:43,128
Master Richie, I do think it unseemly
in the extreme...

422
00:29:43,298 --> 00:29:46,233
...for you to take
these... These children's money.

423
00:29:46,401 --> 00:29:50,269
What are you doing?
Asking the old guy for batting tips?

424
00:29:50,939 --> 00:29:53,669
Hit a touchdown, Master Richie.

425
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:00,180
Come on, Gloria. Right over the plate.

426
00:30:00,348 --> 00:30:02,646
- Strike him out, Gloria.
- Come on, Gloria.

427
00:30:02,817 --> 00:30:04,114
Come on, Gloria!

428
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:06,981
- Hey, batter, batter, batter.
- Easy money. Come on.

429
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:10,156
- Strike him out.
- You got it, Gloria.

430
00:30:10,325 --> 00:30:12,418
Fire it in there.

431
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:21,126
This is a piece of cake.

432
00:30:23,037 --> 00:30:26,200
We got the money in the bag.
Let's go. Come on.

433
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:31,836
- Burn it in.
- Come on, Gloria.

434
00:30:36,518 --> 00:30:41,012
oh, yes, Master Richie! Yes!

435
00:30:41,389 --> 00:30:43,983
- Yes! Yes!
- oh, man.

436
00:30:44,158 --> 00:30:45,887
There goes my lunch money.

437
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,618
Lucky swing, I guess.

438
00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:50,725
I was wondering if you could
come over to my house...

439
00:30:50,899 --> 00:30:54,130
Pee Wee, give him the money.

440
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:57,127
- I don't want your money.
- I said, take it.

441
00:30:57,405 --> 00:30:59,464
You don't belong here.

442
00:31:07,582 --> 00:31:11,143
Truly a prodigious blow, Master Richie.

443
00:31:45,553 --> 00:31:47,020
Thank you.

444
00:31:47,722 --> 00:31:52,591
oh, perk up. It won't be long before you're
having tea and crumpets with the queen.

445
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,751
I'd rather eat a hot dog at Wrigley.

446
00:31:54,929 --> 00:31:56,760
So would I, son, so would I.

447
00:31:57,098 --> 00:32:00,465
oh, Richard, you're not
seriously considering...

448
00:32:00,635 --> 00:32:02,865
...giving the queen the Smellmaster?

449
00:32:03,037 --> 00:32:05,733
Why not, Regina?
I think she'd get a kick out of it.

450
00:32:05,974 --> 00:32:09,034
Anything to take her mind off
those children of hers.

451
00:32:11,112 --> 00:32:13,637
Security check's complete, sir.

452
00:32:13,815 --> 00:32:16,147
I hope you and your family
have a great time.

453
00:32:16,317 --> 00:32:18,877
Thank you, Mr. Ferguson, thank you.

454
00:32:22,457 --> 00:32:24,823
- Cadbury?
- Madam?

455
00:32:24,993 --> 00:32:27,188
What's bothering Richie?

456
00:32:27,595 --> 00:32:31,793
He tried to make friends
with some children yesterday.

457
00:32:31,966 --> 00:32:34,662
It wasn't a great success.

458
00:32:35,403 --> 00:32:38,964
- The poor dear.
- Might I make a suggestion, madam?

459
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,631
- Anything.
- Why not let Master Richie...

460
00:32:41,809 --> 00:32:46,678
...stay here? Young gentlemen are apt
to find royal functions a trifle boring.

461
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:51,114
Whereas here, I could provide
a busy schedule of distractions.

462
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:55,989
Cadbury, you're a genius.
I'll go tell Richie.

463
00:33:03,297 --> 00:33:05,288
All aboard.

464
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:19,212
I could live here.

465
00:33:19,447 --> 00:33:21,813
- It's huge.
- You think they got a pool?

466
00:33:23,384 --> 00:33:25,682
It ain't no house. It's a whole 'hood.

467
00:33:26,821 --> 00:33:29,346
- I've seen bigger.
- Are you kidding?

468
00:33:29,524 --> 00:33:32,584
The place probably has got
its own zip code.

469
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,858
Excuse me, Master Richie.

470
00:33:40,301 --> 00:33:44,829
Sensing you were at a loose end,
I've arranged for a little entertainment.

471
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,739
I'm really not in the mood
for the vienna Boys' Choir today.

472
00:33:49,043 --> 00:33:55,346
Sadly, the choir was unavailable, sir.
But I did make other arrangements.

473
00:33:58,753 --> 00:34:00,050
I don't believe it.

474
00:34:00,221 --> 00:34:01,848
All right, come on.

475
00:34:02,023 --> 00:34:04,617
Thanks, Cadbury, I owe you one.

476
00:34:07,729 --> 00:34:09,697
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, rich man.

477
00:34:09,864 --> 00:34:12,128
- Just checking out your crib, here.
- Crib?

478
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:16,259
I believe that's street slang
for "home," sir. An idiom.

479
00:34:16,437 --> 00:34:18,428
Who you calling an idiom?

480
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,708
And now, if you wish, sir,
luncheon is served.

481
00:34:21,876 --> 00:34:25,539
All right. Food! I like this place.

482
00:34:25,713 --> 00:34:27,943
I hope you didn't go to too much trouble.

483
00:34:28,116 --> 00:34:32,985
Not at all. I prepared a simple,
yet elegant menu...

484
00:34:36,758 --> 00:34:38,350
It sounds delicious.

485
00:34:39,026 --> 00:34:45,431
However, Master Richie was of the opinion
that his guests deserve a break today.

486
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:53,868
- You have your own McDonald's?
- No way!

487
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:56,036
- Not bad.
- Wow.

488
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:58,644
- This is great.
- I want a Big Mac.

489
00:34:58,813 --> 00:35:01,145
I'm doing an analysis of the secret sauce.

490
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:05,247
Come on, guys, get him.
Get out of my way.

491
00:35:05,453 --> 00:35:08,616
- Nice shot.
- I'll be right back.

492
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,323
Come on.

493
00:35:10,491 --> 00:35:11,890
It's called the Dadlink.

494
00:35:12,059 --> 00:35:15,722
It's practically the only way I talk
to my dad. He's away a lot.

495
00:35:15,897 --> 00:35:18,422
I know what you mean.
My dad lives in California.

496
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:21,432
If we didn't e-mail,
I'd probably never talk to him.

497
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,964
Give me the ball. Come on.

498
00:35:25,139 --> 00:35:27,437
Man, he'd like this place, though.

499
00:35:27,608 --> 00:35:29,337
Must be cool to have everything.

500
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:31,307
So you guys wanna play, or what?

501
00:35:31,479 --> 00:35:34,642
Hey, I got an idea.
Wanna try the Kiddipult?

502
00:35:35,016 --> 00:35:36,278
The Kiddipult?

503
00:36:04,946 --> 00:36:07,608
- Unbelievable!
- That was so cool!

504
00:36:07,782 --> 00:36:09,443
That was great!

505
00:36:09,617 --> 00:36:13,485
That was nothing.
You guys wanna play tag?

506
00:36:14,155 --> 00:36:15,645
- Tag?
- Tag?

507
00:36:31,906 --> 00:36:35,967
In the gentle hand of the gardener
lies the hand of God.

508
00:36:36,911 --> 00:36:39,038
- Are you a Sagittarius?
- No, madam.

509
00:36:39,213 --> 00:36:41,078
- Pisces?
- No, madam.

510
00:36:41,249 --> 00:36:43,809
- Leo?
- No. No, I'm a Taurus.

511
00:36:43,985 --> 00:36:47,079
I knew it. The bull.

512
00:36:47,255 --> 00:36:50,782
- Correct, madam.
- oh, look, don't call me madam, okay.

513
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:54,587
I don't like the connotation.
My name's Diane.

514
00:36:54,762 --> 00:36:56,730
of course, Diane.

515
00:36:56,898 --> 00:36:59,366
And how about you?
You got a first name?

516
00:36:59,533 --> 00:37:02,263
- of course.
- And?

517
00:37:02,436 --> 00:37:03,960
- Herbert.
- Herb.

518
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:08,097
No, it's Herbert.
I'm not a seasoning.

519
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,681
Do I detect a rising fire sign,
Herbert?

520
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:28,261
You, Diane, are a Capricorn.

521
00:37:28,429 --> 00:37:30,795
Hey, how did you know that?

522
00:37:31,432 --> 00:37:33,923
Yeah!

523
00:37:35,469 --> 00:37:37,334
oh, yeah!

524
00:37:38,072 --> 00:37:39,869
Yeah!

525
00:37:41,208 --> 00:37:44,075
Man, this is the best day of my life!

526
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:50,211
- Me too.
- The day's not over yet.

527
00:37:50,751 --> 00:37:52,412
You mean, there's more?

528
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:55,686
- Your own roller coaster.
- Check it out.

529
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:58,552
- Awesome!
- It's so big!

530
00:37:58,726 --> 00:38:00,421
That is cool.

531
00:38:00,594 --> 00:38:03,859
My dad gave me this last Christmas.
It's pretty intense.

532
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:08,627
- Yeah, I just ate.
- You always just ate.

533
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:14,671
Now, their plane ought to be
about right here by now.

534
00:38:18,846 --> 00:38:24,250
Just about time for me to move
into a much bigger office.

535
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,983
Roger that, center. <i>Billion Dollar One,</i>
over and out.

536
00:38:35,162 --> 00:38:39,258
Would you take over for a while, darling?
I think I'd like some coffee.

537
00:38:39,433 --> 00:38:43,335
Don't go sneaking into those chocolates.
They're reserved for the queen.

538
00:38:43,504 --> 00:38:47,338
Regina, I'm dieting.
The last thing I want is chocolate.

539
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:55,780
Where are those chocolates?

540
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:58,745
Up, up, up.

541
00:39:03,024 --> 00:39:05,492
Chocolates. Chocolates.

542
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,655
Smellmaster.

543
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,496
<i>Handkerchiefs Hand-embroidered</i>

544
00:39:16,337 --> 00:39:19,204
<i>Marble egg Fabergé</i>

545
00:39:19,673 --> 00:39:22,301
<i>Trinitrotoluene</i>

546
00:39:24,545 --> 00:39:26,740
I'll tell him you called. Thank you.

547
00:39:26,914 --> 00:39:28,609
open it.

548
00:39:31,485 --> 00:39:36,047
Darling, this one doesn't have a tag.
Do you know what it is?

549
00:39:36,223 --> 00:39:40,250
- No, I don't.
- The Smellmaster says it's trinitrotoluene.

550
00:39:40,428 --> 00:39:44,694
And if my memory serves me right,
trinitrotoluene is the proper name for...

551
00:39:45,833 --> 00:39:47,926
TNT!

552
00:39:50,404 --> 00:39:53,931
- Good God, Regina. It's a bomb.
- Get rid of it!

553
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:18,555
Richie, this is great!

554
00:40:33,481 --> 00:40:37,508
To the new chairman of Rich Industries:

555
00:40:40,121 --> 00:40:41,213
Me.

556
00:40:41,989 --> 00:40:46,289
Well, it's been a slice. Maybe I'll see you
around sometime, huh?

557
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:49,122
Yes, you never can tell.

558
00:40:49,296 --> 00:40:53,892
When you get off the embalming fluid,
give me a call, Herbert.

559
00:40:58,973 --> 00:41:01,339
- Thanks a lot for coming over.
- No problem.

560
00:41:01,509 --> 00:41:04,410
Don't forget. Baseball next Wednesday.

561
00:41:04,578 --> 00:41:05,977
- 3:30.
- I'll be there.

562
00:41:06,147 --> 00:41:08,342
Hey, wait. What about our
hundred bucks?

563
00:41:08,516 --> 00:41:11,417
- I said, forget about that, Tony.
- What hundred bucks?

564
00:41:11,585 --> 00:41:15,578
The penguin-looking dude said he'd give us
$ 100 for coming to play with you.

565
00:41:15,756 --> 00:41:20,159
- Gloria, I didn't know that...
- Hey, look. Nobody has to pay us anything.

566
00:41:20,327 --> 00:41:22,454
End of story.

567
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:25,526
See you later, Richie.
We had a great time.

568
00:41:41,482 --> 00:41:44,144
Master Rich, I really am
most dreadfully sorry.

569
00:41:44,318 --> 00:41:46,684
- Mr. Cadbury!
- Excuse me.

570
00:41:57,565 --> 00:41:59,999
Master Rich...

571
00:42:02,469 --> 00:42:03,902
What?

572
00:42:04,205 --> 00:42:06,400
It's your parents.

573
00:42:07,741 --> 00:42:10,005
- Dadlink on.
- <i>Hiya, slugger</i>

574
00:42:10,177 --> 00:42:13,146
- Locate Dad.
- <i>Locating Dad now</i>

575
00:42:14,715 --> 00:42:16,182
<i>Signal contact: negative</i>

576
00:42:19,853 --> 00:42:21,753
<i>Power increase</i>

577
00:42:22,489 --> 00:42:24,150
<i>Searching</i>

578
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,224
<i>Dad not found</i>

579
00:42:30,664 --> 00:42:32,791
<i>Dad not found</i>

580
00:42:34,501 --> 00:42:36,332
<i>Dad not found</i>

581
00:42:38,706 --> 00:42:41,106
Mr. van Dough, sir?

582
00:42:41,275 --> 00:42:43,106
Fergie, <i>entrez.</i>

583
00:42:43,277 --> 00:42:47,907
I was just thinking that after I plunder
the Rich family vault...

584
00:42:48,082 --> 00:42:52,849
...I think I'd like to buy a country
somewhere.

585
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:56,012
Something small, not too ostentatious.

586
00:42:56,190 --> 00:43:00,058
Luxembourg, perhaps, or maybe Ecuador.

587
00:43:01,595 --> 00:43:05,395
Sir, it seems we have a slight problem.

588
00:43:07,901 --> 00:43:10,870
The boy wasn't on the plane, sir.

589
00:43:11,372 --> 00:43:15,069
Feculent fool! After all of my
careful planning...

590
00:43:17,077 --> 00:43:19,011
All right.

591
00:43:21,282 --> 00:43:24,479
I got rid of the king and the queen.

592
00:43:25,052 --> 00:43:30,490
I don't think the boy prince
will be any problem at all.

593
00:43:32,726 --> 00:43:35,126
<i>The plane has been missing</i>
<i>more than 12 hours</i>

594
00:43:35,296 --> 00:43:39,062
<i>But despite the biggest air</i>
<i>and sea search in US naval history</i>

595
00:43:39,233 --> 00:43:42,794
<i>there is still no sign of billionaires</i>
<i>Richard and Regina Rich</i>

596
00:43:43,237 --> 00:43:46,035
<i>missing since the apparent crash</i>
<i>of their plane</i>

597
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:48,606
They're alive, Cadbury. I know it.

598
00:43:48,776 --> 00:43:52,542
And wherever they are, Master Richie,
I'm sure they're together...

599
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:54,681
...and happy.

600
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:58,382
Richard, if we ever get out of this...

601
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:02,010
...l'm gonna soak for a week
in a vat of oil of olay.

602
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:04,382
Why haven't they found us yet?

603
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:08,119
Well, probably because
the locator transmitter in the plane...

604
00:44:08,295 --> 00:44:10,593
...is under a mile of water.

605
00:44:10,764 --> 00:44:14,723
Unless we can see a Radio Shack soon,
we can kiss off any chance...

606
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:16,665
...of getting my Dadlink to work.

607
00:44:17,004 --> 00:44:21,532
There's only one person ruthless enough
to set off a bomb on our plane.

608
00:44:21,709 --> 00:44:24,371
- When I get my fingers...
- We don't know for sure.

609
00:44:24,545 --> 00:44:27,912
oh, Richard, wake up
and smell the seaweed!

610
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:30,482
You should have fired him years ago.

611
00:44:30,651 --> 00:44:34,052
I've never fired anyone in my life.
I don't intend to start now.

612
00:44:34,221 --> 00:44:35,984
But van Dough...

613
00:44:36,523 --> 00:44:39,048
He thought Richie
was on the plane with us.

614
00:44:41,161 --> 00:44:43,527
Regina, we have to survive...

615
00:44:43,697 --> 00:44:46,564
...if only to warn Richie.
His life is in danger.

616
00:44:52,072 --> 00:44:54,540
Ladies and gentlemen...

617
00:44:55,909 --> 00:44:59,140
...before we begin, I'd like to observe
a moment of silence...

618
00:44:59,313 --> 00:45:03,044
...on the tragic passing
of Mr. and Mrs. Rich.

619
00:45:05,185 --> 00:45:09,212
Now, first order of business:

620
00:45:09,857 --> 00:45:12,826
United Tool.

621
00:45:14,228 --> 00:45:16,753
What do you mean, they closed
the factory?

622
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:19,922
It just happened. My mom
and everyone else got fired.

623
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,261
I didn't know. You gotta believe me.

624
00:45:22,436 --> 00:45:26,065
<i>Hey, I'm really sorry about your parents,</i>
<i>but can't you help?</i>

625
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:39,043
I don't know if I can do this, Cadbury.

626
00:45:39,219 --> 00:45:43,178
Remember this...

627
00:45:43,357 --> 00:45:46,121
- What's that mean?
- It means you have the power...

628
00:45:46,293 --> 00:45:48,056
...of your father inside you.

629
00:45:48,228 --> 00:45:50,594
Kind of like, "Trust the Force, Luke."

630
00:45:52,633 --> 00:45:54,794
Exactly, sir.

631
00:46:04,945 --> 00:46:07,607
It's so hard.

632
00:46:08,615 --> 00:46:09,980
Sir?

633
00:46:12,219 --> 00:46:14,949
Mr. Richard Rich Jr. to see you.

634
00:46:18,459 --> 00:46:21,326
Miss Fairchild, I need those memos done
by 3:00 today.

635
00:46:21,495 --> 00:46:23,588
Yes, sir, Mr. van Dough, sir.

636
00:46:23,764 --> 00:46:28,428
Richie, Richie, Richie, Richie...

637
00:46:29,069 --> 00:46:32,334
Allow me to express my heartfelt
sympathies over your loss.

638
00:46:32,506 --> 00:46:35,066
We all loved your mother and father
very much.

639
00:46:35,409 --> 00:46:37,570
My parents are alive.

640
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:40,772
I pray nightly that they are.

641
00:46:41,081 --> 00:46:45,575
I want you to know we're doing everything
we can to coordinate the search effort.

642
00:46:46,019 --> 00:46:47,782
Please, have a seat.

643
00:46:57,364 --> 00:47:01,824
- So, what have you come to see me about?
- Well, until my parents come back...

644
00:47:02,002 --> 00:47:03,936
...l've taken a...

645
00:47:04,271 --> 00:47:05,829
Sabbatical, sir.

646
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:08,939
I've taken a sabbatical from school.

647
00:47:09,109 --> 00:47:11,942
You know, so I can be here
and run things.

648
00:47:12,112 --> 00:47:15,013
Run things.

649
00:47:15,182 --> 00:47:19,448
Richie, the job of senior officer...

650
00:47:20,387 --> 00:47:22,150
...of a multi...

651
00:47:23,357 --> 00:47:25,848
National corporation...

652
00:47:26,226 --> 00:47:30,026
...it's very demanding business.

653
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:34,662
Hours go, well just, way past
your bedtime.

654
00:47:34,835 --> 00:47:38,362
So I think that it's best
to leave this job to...

655
00:47:40,541 --> 00:47:45,205
...an adult who has experience
in these matters. okay?

656
00:47:46,146 --> 00:47:47,408
I don't think so.

657
00:47:48,815 --> 00:47:51,545
By the way, Cadbury,
how much stock do I own?

658
00:47:51,718 --> 00:47:55,154
Until your parents are found, sir,
as the sole heir...

659
00:47:55,322 --> 00:47:58,052
...you own 51 percent of the voting stock.

660
00:47:58,225 --> 00:48:01,092
You're not of legal age
to exercise your voting rights.

661
00:48:01,261 --> 00:48:03,126
But I am, sir.

662
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:07,666
And under the terms of the Rich estate,
I stand in <i>loco parentis</i>

663
00:48:07,834 --> 00:48:11,099
...and <i>Guardian ad Litem</i>
to Master Richie.

664
00:48:11,271 --> 00:48:16,504
And accordingly, I give him full
proxy power and authority.

665
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:23,413
And by the way, United Tool stays open.

666
00:48:24,184 --> 00:48:26,118
Fine.

667
00:48:28,889 --> 00:48:31,790
Round one to you, sir.

668
00:48:42,069 --> 00:48:46,165
With the losses in our manufacturing
division, this will necessitate...

669
00:48:52,713 --> 00:48:54,271
Sorry.

670
00:48:54,448 --> 00:48:57,042
Will necessitate
some employee downsizing.

671
00:48:57,217 --> 00:49:00,015
Downsizing. You mean fire people.

672
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:03,054
Well, call it what you will, Richie.

673
00:49:03,223 --> 00:49:05,123
It is our job to cut the fat.

674
00:49:05,292 --> 00:49:08,318
Mr. van Dough, my father never
fired anybody.

675
00:49:08,495 --> 00:49:11,430
He always said when
people are secure in their jobs...

676
00:49:11,598 --> 00:49:13,657
...they work harder, happier
and better.

677
00:49:14,568 --> 00:49:19,130
So I think if we need to cut the fat,
I say we start right here.

678
00:49:30,183 --> 00:49:31,912
- Good morning.
- Morning.

679
00:49:32,085 --> 00:49:34,383
- Morning. Your messages.
- Morning, Sylvia.

680
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:36,988
- Morning, Mr. Rich.
- Morning.

681
00:49:37,991 --> 00:49:39,754
Yeah, Marvin, I understand that.

682
00:49:39,926 --> 00:49:43,794
Yes, but if all of our divisions are doing
record-breaking business...

683
00:49:43,964 --> 00:49:46,831
...how come Rich candy bars
are down 12 percent?

684
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,663
oh, come on. Have you ever actually
tasted a Rich bar?

685
00:49:56,777 --> 00:50:00,645
He'll get back to you as soon
as possible, Mr. lacocca. Goodbye.

686
00:50:00,814 --> 00:50:04,079
Richie Rich's office. Yes.

687
00:50:05,952 --> 00:50:07,613
Talk about gumballs.

688
00:50:07,788 --> 00:50:11,588
Richie Rich's office. I'm sorry.
He's not available. He's in conference.

689
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:14,955
- I'll have him call you.
- Excuse me. We'd like to see Richie.

690
00:50:15,128 --> 00:50:17,688
- And you are?
- Hey, they're free!

691
00:50:17,864 --> 00:50:20,025
- We're his friends.
- We wanna thank him...

692
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:24,227
...for reopening the factory.
- Mr. Rich is much too busy to see anyone.

693
00:50:24,404 --> 00:50:26,065
But wait, we can...

694
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:27,729
Richie Rich's office.

695
00:50:27,908 --> 00:50:29,466
Hey!

696
00:50:30,243 --> 00:50:32,939
Excuse me! Somebody help!

697
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:37,243
- I didn't do it! I didn't do it!
- Get Pee Wee. We're going in.

698
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:39,445
Come on, let's go.

699
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:42,679
- I didn't do it.
- Are you all right?

700
00:50:44,491 --> 00:50:48,222
- Richie.
- Gloria? Hey, guys.

701
00:50:48,395 --> 00:50:49,726
Close the door.

702
00:50:49,896 --> 00:50:52,057
I'll have to get back to you, Marvin.

703
00:50:52,232 --> 00:50:56,601
Yeah, my new research and development
team just walked in.

704
00:50:56,770 --> 00:50:58,362
- What?
- What?

705
00:50:58,538 --> 00:51:01,871
And finally, after extensive
and exhausting taste testing...

706
00:51:02,042 --> 00:51:04,602
...by my new research
and development team...

707
00:51:04,778 --> 00:51:06,507
- Hi.
- How you doing?

708
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:11,674
...l've come to the conclusion that we must
increase our nut proportion by 15 percent.

709
00:51:11,852 --> 00:51:15,515
We simply cannot let our competition
be nuttier than we are.

710
00:51:18,125 --> 00:51:20,958
- Yes.
- That's our idea.

711
00:51:33,406 --> 00:51:35,101
- Come on, guys.
- Excuse me.

712
00:51:35,275 --> 00:51:37,971
Excuse me. Coming through.

713
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:45,375
All those in favor of my motion?

714
00:51:50,657 --> 00:51:52,955
All opposed?

715
00:52:02,102 --> 00:52:03,660
I hate that kid.

716
00:52:03,837 --> 00:52:07,739
No, no. Clockwise, clockwise.
I said, massage clockwise.

717
00:52:07,908 --> 00:52:11,036
Migraines are bad enough
without your incompetence. Get out!

718
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:14,203
Yes, sir, Mr. van Dough.

719
00:52:14,848 --> 00:52:19,512
Now, you listen. I want you to put the
revised plan we discussed into action.

720
00:52:19,686 --> 00:52:22,678
And this time, make sure
the gloves come off.

721
00:52:23,356 --> 00:52:27,156
- Gloves, sir?
- It's a metaphor, hamhead.

722
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:33,161
Well, that's it, honey.

723
00:52:33,333 --> 00:52:37,394
We're out of Perrier. Caviar's gone,
and there's no more Melba toast.

724
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:40,233
The only thing we've got left
is a bottle of Dom.

725
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:44,969
And this little packet of Bubblicious.
Richie's favorite.

726
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:50,307
He's only 12 years old, Richard.
He's just a boy.

727
00:52:50,483 --> 00:52:54,442
Now, Regina, I'm sure whatever happens,
he's going to be just fine.

728
00:52:58,225 --> 00:52:59,749
- oh, my God!
- What is it?

729
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:02,394
- We're saved! We're saved!
- What? What? What?

730
00:53:02,562 --> 00:53:06,828
My Louis! Darling, my suitcase.

731
00:53:11,004 --> 00:53:15,270
And when my father gets back, I'm sure
he'll be happy to see what we've done.

732
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:19,776
The profits from every division
have gone up on a record-breaking rise.

733
00:53:21,548 --> 00:53:25,450
- It doesn't give you the right...
- I'm sorry, but this is police business.

734
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,918
- Herbert Cadbury!
- Yes.

735
00:53:29,089 --> 00:53:30,579
You're under arrest.

736
00:53:30,757 --> 00:53:32,224
- Pardon?
- What is this?

737
00:53:32,392 --> 00:53:35,828
You can't just burst in here.
What is the meaning of this?

738
00:53:35,996 --> 00:53:38,487
We received a tip
and searched the Rich mansion.

739
00:53:38,665 --> 00:53:42,101
Bomb parts, detonation devices
found in Herbert Cadbury's room.

740
00:53:42,269 --> 00:53:44,237
- Preposterous.
- You're under arrest...

741
00:53:44,404 --> 00:53:46,201
...for Mr. and Mrs. Rich's murder.

742
00:53:46,373 --> 00:53:50,400
I don't know what you're talking about.
Don't worry. I'm sure it's a mistake.

743
00:53:50,577 --> 00:53:52,738
Cadbury! Cadbury!

744
00:53:53,113 --> 00:53:55,707
Richie, police have him now.
Best stay here.

745
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:58,951
Do you understand that you can stop
these proceedings?

746
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:02,919
Richie, is it true that Mr. Cadbury
planted a bomb on your parents' jet?

747
00:54:03,089 --> 00:54:04,784
Do you think they were murdered?

748
00:54:04,958 --> 00:54:07,688
- How do you feel?
- What's the future of United Tool?

749
00:54:07,861 --> 00:54:11,422
- Richie!
- Are your parents alive?

750
00:54:11,932 --> 00:54:15,424
- Mr. van Dough!
- We are deeply saddened by this tragic turn.

751
00:54:15,602 --> 00:54:17,832
I'd like to believe in
Cadbury's innocence.

752
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:21,440
- But evidence points in the other direction.
- Mr. van Dough.

753
00:54:21,608 --> 00:54:26,739
of course, my main concern is that
poor Richie survives this terrible episode.

754
00:54:26,913 --> 00:54:31,247
And having his best interests at heart,
I have petitioned Superior Court...

755
00:54:31,418 --> 00:54:34,649
...to become the boy's legal guardian.

756
00:54:34,821 --> 00:54:36,584
That's all for right now. Thanks.

757
00:54:36,756 --> 00:54:39,782
<i>The court has granted legal guardianship</i>
<i>of Richie Rich</i>

758
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:43,225
<i>to Laurence Van Dough,</i>
<i>trusted friend of the Rich family</i>

759
00:54:43,396 --> 00:54:47,332
<i>Meanwhile, bail has been denied</i>
<i>to accused murderer, Herbert Cadbury</i>

760
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:51,766
<i>And believing Cadbury may have had</i>
<i>accomplices, Mr Van Dough dismissed</i>

761
00:54:51,938 --> 00:54:53,963
<i>all employees of the Rich family</i>

762
00:54:54,574 --> 00:54:58,635
<i>The Southside community adoption service</i>
<i>released figures for the last year...</i>

763
00:55:04,918 --> 00:55:08,183
My makeup case.

764
00:55:08,355 --> 00:55:12,451
My dresses, my Karl Lagerfeld,
my Bill Blass.

765
00:55:12,625 --> 00:55:16,527
My tuxedo. Now we can throw
a dinner party.

766
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:20,556
Well, what do we have...?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

767
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:23,134
Here's something we can use.

768
00:55:23,303 --> 00:55:26,795
Don't you think this is an odd time
to start shaving your legs?

769
00:55:26,973 --> 00:55:31,603
Don't you understand? This may be the very
thing that will save us. The very thing.

770
00:55:31,778 --> 00:55:34,747
Yes, yes!

771
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:37,974
Richard, darling, you've been
too long at sea.

772
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:40,613
<i>Dad not found</i>

773
00:55:41,221 --> 00:55:43,621
<i>Dad not found</i>

774
00:55:44,024 --> 00:55:46,891
<i>Dad not found</i>

775
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:49,688
Excuse me, Richie.

776
00:55:49,863 --> 00:55:53,264
- Right under that archway.
- What are you doing? What is that?

777
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:57,699
- Security camera. For your protection.
- My protection?

778
00:55:57,871 --> 00:56:01,398
Yeah. And until further notice...

779
00:56:01,574 --> 00:56:05,066
...l'm afraid I can't let you leave
the grounds of the estate.

780
00:56:05,245 --> 00:56:08,544
After what happened to your parents,
we can't take any chances.

781
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:10,540
What about the company?

782
00:56:10,850 --> 00:56:14,411
You won't be going
to the office anymore, Richie.

783
00:56:15,855 --> 00:56:20,986
Mr. van Dough will be running
the office from now on.

784
00:56:21,694 --> 00:56:24,925
- Nice doggy.
- Come on, Dollar.

785
00:56:38,578 --> 00:56:42,810
Right there, camera 23.
That position's good. Lock it down.

786
00:56:47,787 --> 00:56:50,278
I don't believe this.

787
00:56:50,457 --> 00:56:54,018
It's like I'm a prisoner, Dollar,
in my own home.

788
00:56:57,230 --> 00:57:01,690
I'm gonna go have a talk with
Mr. van Dough. You stay here. Good dog.

789
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:13,544
Well, sir, things have turned out
just the way we planned.

790
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:16,441
You planned, sir.
Just the way you planned.

791
00:57:16,616 --> 00:57:21,644
Well, not exactly. The vault.
Where is the vault?

792
00:57:21,821 --> 00:57:26,485
There must be billions hidden in there.
You're head of security. Where is the vault?

793
00:57:26,659 --> 00:57:30,823
I told you, sir. That's one thing
I was never privy to.

794
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:36,161
What about the rotund
Professor Keenbean?

795
00:57:36,336 --> 00:57:40,432
Claims he doesn't know.

796
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:45,670
<i>And you believe him, you idiot</i>
<i>The man is a lying, disgusting toad</i>

797
00:57:45,845 --> 00:57:47,779
<i>About the butler, sir</i>

798
00:57:47,947 --> 00:57:53,613
<i>I've arranged it so Mr Cadbury will soon</i>
<i>be so overcome with guilt and remorse</i>

799
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:57,480
...he's going to hang himself in his cell.

800
00:58:10,837 --> 00:58:12,805
To the lab.

801
00:58:13,439 --> 00:58:17,398
- They're gonna kill Cadbury?
- They're gonna make it look like a suicide.

802
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:21,707
- We have to do something. Bust him out...
- Here it is.

803
00:58:21,881 --> 00:58:26,511
- What is it?
- This baby here is the ultimate corrosive.

804
00:58:26,686 --> 00:58:31,385
Don't touch it! I call it
"hydrocloricdioxynucleocarbonium."

805
00:58:31,558 --> 00:58:35,995
The name needs work.
But it'll eat through a Buick.

806
00:58:36,629 --> 00:58:38,620
or...

807
00:58:39,332 --> 00:58:43,632
- Prison bars.
- Exactly.

808
00:58:53,913 --> 00:58:57,144
Welcome to your worst nightmare.

809
00:59:01,754 --> 00:59:03,051
Gin.

810
00:59:07,026 --> 00:59:08,425
Sorry.

811
00:59:08,595 --> 00:59:12,497
What kind of deal is that? I don't need
the money tomorrow, I need it today.

812
00:59:12,665 --> 00:59:15,532
You don't understand. She's my mother.

813
00:59:19,172 --> 00:59:22,869
- Excuse me, sir.
- What do you want?

814
00:59:23,576 --> 00:59:28,536
- Well, what do you want?
- I want you to give this to my uncle.

815
00:59:28,715 --> 00:59:31,240
- Who's your uncle?
- Herbert Cadbury.

816
00:59:31,551 --> 00:59:35,248
Cadbury, huh? Let me see this.

817
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:41,017
- What's this?
- It's Latin.

818
00:59:41,361 --> 00:59:44,558
Latino? I thought he was English.

819
00:59:44,964 --> 00:59:48,092
- What's this?
- very special toothpaste.

820
00:59:50,403 --> 00:59:53,372
He has really sensitive teeth.

821
00:59:57,877 --> 01:00:00,368
- You got 10 minutes to do whatever.
- Thank you.

822
01:00:00,546 --> 01:00:02,912
Get to it.

823
01:00:27,173 --> 01:00:30,540
I'm getting out of here. Let's go. Hurry.

824
01:00:32,679 --> 01:00:37,082
Thank heavens. My teeth
were starting to grow fur.

825
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:44,689
Talk about extra-strength tartar control.

826
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:52,288
"Life in danger."

827
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:58,927
"Use toothpaste on bars."

828
01:00:59,105 --> 01:01:04,042
Life in danger? Really!
How melodramatic.

829
01:01:11,984 --> 01:01:16,148
Help! officer! Help me! Help!

830
01:01:34,974 --> 01:01:39,468
Never mess with a man
with sensitive teeth.

831
01:02:04,871 --> 01:02:07,601
- Cadbury?
- Richie.

832
01:02:08,841 --> 01:02:12,572
- You're okay.
- I've been worried sick.

833
01:02:12,745 --> 01:02:16,909
I do beg your pardon, sir. All that emotion.
Quite out of order.

834
01:02:17,083 --> 01:02:18,573
Got caught up in the moment.

835
01:02:18,751 --> 01:02:20,218
- Cadbury.
- Yes, sir.

836
01:02:20,386 --> 01:02:22,013
- Shut up.
- Thank you, sir.

837
01:02:22,488 --> 01:02:23,750
Look.

838
01:02:25,792 --> 01:02:29,455
- I'm so sorry. I hadn't heard.
- No, look. They only found the plane.

839
01:02:29,896 --> 01:02:33,764
No bodies, no life raft.
Mom and Dad are alive. I know it.

840
01:02:33,933 --> 01:02:36,629
- And the Dadlink?
- We can't go back to the house.

841
01:02:36,969 --> 01:02:40,370
But I have another idea. Come on.

842
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:42,903
Looking radical in those clothes.

843
01:02:43,075 --> 01:02:45,635
Thank God I was able to hold on to
my underwear.

844
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:56,815
So Master Richie helped Cadbury
escape from jail.

845
01:02:56,989 --> 01:03:00,720
I knew that! I know everything!
Everything, do you hear?

846
01:03:00,893 --> 01:03:03,487
What I know about you
will put you both in jail!

847
01:03:03,663 --> 01:03:08,327
Really? In that case, I'm afraid that
we're just gonna have to kill you.

848
01:03:09,669 --> 01:03:13,799
I don't know that much. What do I know?
Who'd believe me anyway?

849
01:03:13,973 --> 01:03:16,635
I do believe there is one thing
you do know...

850
01:03:16,809 --> 01:03:19,710
...which will be very helpful to me.
- Forget it!

851
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:25,647
I'm not helping you. Nothing you do can
make me talk! Do you hear? Nothing!

852
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,687
Good morning, madam.

853
01:03:35,862 --> 01:03:37,955
Cadbury, come on.

854
01:03:44,170 --> 01:03:46,195
This is it, right here.

855
01:03:50,676 --> 01:03:52,667
- Hello?
- Gloria, it's me.

856
01:03:52,845 --> 01:03:54,745
Richie?

857
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:58,213
Whoa. Look who's slumming.

858
01:03:59,519 --> 01:04:02,317
Gloria, I need to use your computer.
It's important.

859
01:04:02,488 --> 01:04:04,353
Come on in.

860
01:04:10,963 --> 01:04:13,022
Well, here goes.

861
01:04:18,804 --> 01:04:20,567
oh, no.

862
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:23,607
- Wait. Wait a minute.
- What are you doing? What is it?

863
01:04:23,776 --> 01:04:27,268
It may just do it. Wait, wait, wait.

864
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:35,713
It's working?

865
01:04:36,622 --> 01:04:39,216
Let's just hope the power holds out.

866
01:04:39,392 --> 01:04:43,488
- Hope Richie hasn't given up the search.
- Richie? of course he won't.

867
01:04:43,663 --> 01:04:45,927
- I'm gonna go get changed.
- Changed?

868
01:04:46,098 --> 01:04:52,230
Yes, of course, darling. There's no way
I'm going to be rescued looking like this.

869
01:04:57,577 --> 01:05:01,479
- Just a few more seconds. It should be in.
- I like this look on you.

870
01:05:01,647 --> 01:05:04,707
If I didn't know better,
I'd think you were almost normal.

871
01:05:04,884 --> 01:05:08,047
- Thanks. I think.
- No, I mean it.

872
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:11,155
I used to think you were just
some spoiled rich kid.

873
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:13,758
But now you're not so bad.

874
01:05:13,926 --> 01:05:17,123
Yeah. Likewise.

875
01:05:17,296 --> 01:05:20,197
No, no, please, madam.
Madam, no, no, no!

876
01:05:20,366 --> 01:05:22,527
That really isn't...

877
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:28,034
- Thank you, madam.
- I told you, don't call me madam.

878
01:05:28,207 --> 01:05:30,801
Forgive me, Diane.

879
01:05:31,243 --> 01:05:33,040
Richie did it! He's in!

880
01:05:35,848 --> 01:05:38,146
<i>Hiya, slugger</i>

881
01:05:46,892 --> 01:05:49,383
What the heck?

882
01:05:50,997 --> 01:05:54,057
Mike, get me Ferguson.

883
01:05:57,937 --> 01:06:00,667
Come on, professor. Play nice.

884
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:03,274
- Think I'm enjoying this?
- Yes.

885
01:06:03,542 --> 01:06:06,238
But anyway...

886
01:06:06,846 --> 01:06:09,747
You told me what this machine
could do to a person.

887
01:06:09,915 --> 01:06:14,318
How would you like to spend the rest
of your life as a bedpan?

888
01:06:14,487 --> 01:06:17,650
You've gotta believe me!
I don't know where the vault is!

889
01:06:17,823 --> 01:06:23,159
- And even if I did it, it wouldn't help you!
- Ferguson, wait.

890
01:06:24,163 --> 01:06:27,530
- Tell me why, professor.
- Because the lock is voice-activated...

891
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:30,168
...and only Mr. and Mrs. Rich
can open it!

892
01:06:30,336 --> 01:06:34,864
Unfortunately, Mr. and Mrs. Rich
have been detained permanently.

893
01:06:36,108 --> 01:06:39,339
So come up with another way
for me to get into that vault.

894
01:06:39,512 --> 01:06:41,673
Yes, but...

895
01:06:45,551 --> 01:06:47,485
What?

896
01:06:48,387 --> 01:06:49,911
What?

897
01:06:50,222 --> 01:06:51,519
Sir, I have a situation.

898
01:06:51,857 --> 01:06:53,449
Handle it.

899
01:06:55,127 --> 01:06:56,685
I'm sorry. Hungry, professor?

900
01:06:57,563 --> 01:07:00,361
- You're despicable.
- Enjoy.

901
01:07:08,507 --> 01:07:10,065
<i>Locating Dad now</i>

902
01:07:12,211 --> 01:07:14,577
- <i>Dad found</i>
- They're alive! I knew it!

903
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:19,980
<i>Exact coordinates will be pinpointed</i>

904
01:07:22,521 --> 01:07:24,352

01:07:27,159 --> 01:07:29,059
- Ten.
- oh, my God. They're alive.

907
01:07:30,529 --> 01:07:33,157
- Nine, eight.
- Nine, eight.

908
01:07:34,567 --> 01:07:35,556
<i>Seven, six</i>

909

- Access terminated?
- I've been cut off!

- They must've pulled the modem!
- But your parents are alive, sir.

911
01:07:44,043 --> 01:07:47,774
- It proves they're alive.
- I have to get to the Dadlink.

912
01:07:47,947 --> 01:07:49,812
Mr. van Dough, sir...

913
01:07:49,982 --> 01:07:53,577
...I think we've found a way
into that vault, after all.

914

<i>Dad found</i>

915
01:07:58,357 --> 01:08:01,485
- Come on. Let's get going.
- Wait there. We'll be right down.

916
01:08:02,862 --> 01:08:05,922
Are you entirely convinced
this is a good idea, sir?

917
01:08:06,098 --> 01:08:09,761
- lf anything goes wrong...
- The Dadlink in my room's our only chance.

918
01:08:09,935 --> 01:08:13,769
- I'm going.
- Yes, but, Master Richie, please consider...

919
01:08:13,939 --> 01:08:18,842
Well, I'm wanted for attempted murder,
escaping from jail, blowing up an aircraft...

920
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:21,946
...breaking and entering
sounds right up my alley.

921
01:08:22,114 --> 01:08:24,947
- Let's kick some butt, shall we?
- Let's.

922
01:08:33,225 --> 01:08:36,126
Well, that's it. It's all up to Richie now.

923
01:08:36,295 --> 01:08:38,763
Well, then, everything is fine.

924
01:08:38,931 --> 01:08:40,626
- Richie never lets us down.
- No.

925
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:42,665
He never would.

926
01:08:43,969 --> 01:08:46,028
Wait, darling, do you hear that?

927
01:08:47,573 --> 01:08:49,370
Yes. Yes, it is!

928
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:53,444
- It's a plane! It's a plane!
- oh, my God! Richard, we're saved!

929
01:08:53,612 --> 01:08:55,045
oh, Richie!

01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:56,841
- Heroic boy!
- over here! Hello?!

931
01:08:57,016 --> 01:08:59,610
- Lovely son! Hello!
- Hello?! Plane!

932
01:09:09,929 --> 01:09:12,329
If any of you wanna turn back,
now's the time.

933
01:09:12,498 --> 01:09:14,762
No way. We're with you, Richie.

934
01:09:20,139 --> 01:09:22,198
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

935
01:09:37,323 --> 01:09:38,551
Yes.

936
01:09:39,925 --> 01:09:41,552

937
01:09:42,161 --> 01:09:43,185

- Hey! It's all we could find.
- Yeah.

941
01:10:06,652 --> 01:10:08,620
very well. Load.

942
01:10:13,425 --> 01:10:16,758
All right. I'm in position.

Everything's slicker than snot
on a doorknob.

965

969
01:12:02,067 --> 01:12:03,329
Flashlight.

970
01:12:04,203 --> 01:12:07,366
- Are you okay?
- You wouldn't believe what they did to me.

971
01:12:07,539 --> 01:12:10,440
- It was inhuman. No! Wait!
- Where's van Dough?

972
01:12:10,609 --> 01:12:13,510
He got a phone call and ran out.
He's not nice person.

973
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:18,048
Cadbury and I have to get up to my room.
We need a diversion to get past the guard.

974
01:12:18,217 --> 01:12:20,082
I think I can whip up something.

975
01:12:20,252 --> 01:12:21,981
- Gloria, you go with him.
- okay.

976
01:12:22,154 --> 01:12:23,712

- Come on!

01:12:28,394 --> 01:12:30,055
Go, go, go.

978
01:12:37,036 --> 01:12:39,061

982
01:13:01,493 --> 01:13:04,360
- Give that a turn to the right.
- What are we doing?

983
01:13:04,530 --> 01:13:07,021
Well, what they need is a diversion.

984
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:10,168
This is a combination
of laundry detergent...

985
01:13:10,335 --> 01:13:13,304
...dish-washing detergent
and bubble bath. Take that off.

986
01:13:13,472 --> 01:13:16,600
I call it "Sudsational."

987
01:13:19,445 --> 01:13:20,810

988
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,141

01:13:36,361 --> 01:13:40,457
Mr. Zullo, we have a problem
with the front fountain.

992
01:13:40,632 --> 01:13:44,363
- Then turn it off, you idiot.
- You heard the man. Go.

993
01:13:44,803 --> 01:13:46,134

994
01:14:05,357 --> 01:14:07,791

I'll be just a second.

995
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:09,291

997
01:14:20,072 --> 01:14:21,903

- I don't know!

998
01:14:24,176 --> 01:14:26,201
We did it, Mom. They're in there.

999
01:14:26,378 --> 01:14:29,643
All right. Richie, Herbert,
you're on your own.

1000
01:14:33,051 --> 01:14:36,020

1004
01:14:44,396 --> 01:14:45,988
Welcome home, Richie.

1005
01:14:47,032 --> 01:14:49,091
You were even quicker than I thought.

1006
01:14:52,437 --> 01:14:55,702
- Mom! Dad!
- our other guests should be arriving...

1007
01:14:56,041 --> 01:14:57,474
...any moment.

1008
01:15:02,681 --> 01:15:05,013
Hey, man, are you nervous or something?

1009
01:15:05,184 --> 01:15:07,709
- What are you talking about?
- Did you fart?

1010
01:15:07,886 --> 01:15:10,081
- No.
- Man, you cut the cheese.

1011
01:15:10,255 --> 01:15:13,452
- Whoever smelt it, dealt it.
- Whoever denied it, supplied it.

1012
01:15:17,629 --> 01:15:19,961
- What is that?
- I don't know.

1013
01:15:29,641 --> 01:15:30,869
Sir.

1014
01:15:31,944 --> 01:15:35,277
- Got them.
- outstanding. Bring them in.

1015
01:15:36,148 --> 01:15:39,584
- Richie, darling, I'm so worried about you.
- Thank you.

1016
01:15:39,751 --> 01:15:43,517
- Why are you doing all this?!
- Yes, Laurence, what are you after?

1017
01:15:44,256 --> 01:15:45,587
The vault, Richard.

1018
01:15:45,891 --> 01:15:47,552
The Rich family vault.

1019
01:15:47,726 --> 01:15:50,661
- Is that what this is all about?
- Yes. Yes, the vault.

1020
01:15:50,829 --> 01:15:53,263
- Where is it?
- There.

1021
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:56,663
- Where?
- out there!

1022
01:16:04,042 --> 01:16:05,509
Mount Richmore?

1023
01:16:06,945 --> 01:16:09,379
Your vault is an entire mountain?

1024
01:16:09,548 --> 01:16:12,574
- Well...
- You really are filthy rich, aren't you?

1025
01:16:14,419 --> 01:16:16,546
You take me to that vault right now.

1026
01:16:17,289 --> 01:16:18,586
Just to make sure...

1027
01:16:18,757 --> 01:16:22,124
...l'll have Mr. Ferguson watch
Master Richie until we get back.

1028
01:16:22,294 --> 01:16:23,886
No! Don't hurt Richie!

1029
01:16:25,530 --> 01:16:28,021
If you two cooperate, I promise...

1030
01:16:29,034 --> 01:16:31,559
...no one will get hurt.
- I'll be okay, Mom.

1031
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:34,495
Shall we?

1032
01:16:37,843 --> 01:16:41,643
I will not be held responsible
if that weasel steals my inventions...

1033
01:16:41,813 --> 01:16:44,805
...if they fall into the wrong hands...
Robo-Bee!

1034
01:16:47,753 --> 01:16:49,880
My little pretty...

1035
01:16:50,055 --> 01:16:51,818
Let's go! Let's go!

1036
01:16:51,990 --> 01:16:53,321
Come on! Move!

1037
01:16:54,293 --> 01:16:55,920
After all this family's
done...

1038
01:16:56,094 --> 01:16:59,655
I guess I won't be winning
that Employee of the Month award.

1039
01:16:59,998 --> 01:17:01,795
- very funny.
- Keep moving.

1040
01:17:01,967 --> 01:17:03,594
- Move!
- All right, all right.

1041
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:06,838
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1042
01:17:07,005 --> 01:17:08,666
Hey, watch it!

1043
01:17:13,312 --> 01:17:15,303
All right. Everybody in.

1044
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:18,449
- No. I'm not going in there.
- No way. I'm not going in.

1045
01:17:19,484 --> 01:17:22,453
- Everybody in!
- Sure. Whatever you say. You're the boss.

1046
01:17:22,854 --> 01:17:24,651
St. Peter on a Popsicle stick...

1047
01:17:24,823 --> 01:17:27,087
...he's gonna scramble their molecules.

1048
01:17:27,426 --> 01:17:30,759
Don't panic. Don't panic, Keenbean,
you'll think of something.

1049
01:17:30,929 --> 01:17:33,693
What?! What are you gonna think of?

1050
01:17:36,034 --> 01:17:37,695
We're going!

1051
01:17:43,642 --> 01:17:45,439
- Careful...
- Let's go! Let's go!

1052
01:17:46,345 --> 01:17:47,869
All right, watch your heads.

1053
01:17:52,150 --> 01:17:54,948
- Jerk! Let me out!
- Let's see if this thing works!

1054
01:17:59,324 --> 01:18:02,122
- I'm stuck!
- It's the fat man!

1055
01:18:07,632 --> 01:18:10,533
- Keenbean?
- Keenbean! He's here.

1056
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:16,398
Nice try, professor.

1057
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:19,305
But you're gonna have to
do better than that!

1058
01:18:21,613 --> 01:18:22,841
Let's...

1059
01:18:23,014 --> 01:18:25,278
...play a little game...

1060
01:18:25,450 --> 01:18:27,509
...with your little friends!

1061
01:18:30,455 --> 01:18:31,922
Ignition!

1062
01:18:40,866 --> 01:18:44,734
Thirty more seconds and you won't
recognize your little friends!

1063
01:18:49,374 --> 01:18:51,865
Don't worry, Richie!
I've got him covered!

1064
01:18:52,043 --> 01:18:53,340
Save us, professor.

1065
01:18:55,847 --> 01:18:58,077
- No!
- Somebody get us out!

1066
01:19:00,619 --> 01:19:02,348
I can't reach the machines!

1067
01:19:11,863 --> 01:19:13,262
Fly, my beauty!

1068
01:19:13,432 --> 01:19:16,401
Fly like you've never flown before!

1069
01:19:33,251 --> 01:19:34,377
Eureka!

1070
01:19:34,786 --> 01:19:36,617
Careful, Richie! The Cementia!

1071
01:19:37,222 --> 01:19:38,814
- Thank you, professor.
- Yes.

1072
01:19:38,990 --> 01:19:40,685
- Cadbury...
- Master Richie!

1073
01:19:41,326 --> 01:19:43,624
I've gotta get to Mom and Dad.

1074
01:19:45,430 --> 01:19:46,761
Wait!

1075
01:20:06,885 --> 01:20:08,546
oh, yes.

1076
01:20:10,121 --> 01:20:11,611
Look at that.

1077
01:20:12,424 --> 01:20:13,652
Finally.

1078
01:20:13,925 --> 01:20:15,916
All right, now. open it.

1079
01:20:16,094 --> 01:20:19,257
- Hello, vault.
- <i>Hiya, boss!</i>

1080
01:20:19,631 --> 01:20:22,031
<i>Please state the code for voice check</i>

1081
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:23,758
open it now. open it!

1082
01:20:46,291 --> 01:20:49,158
- <i>Code accepted</i>
- Thank you, Beavis and Butthead.

1083
01:21:14,252 --> 01:21:16,049
This is incredible!

1084
01:21:16,221 --> 01:21:18,018
This is amazing!

1085
01:21:18,690 --> 01:21:20,817
This is... This is...

1086
01:21:20,992 --> 01:21:22,220
This is junk!

1087
01:21:23,128 --> 01:21:24,356
Junk?

1088
01:21:24,930 --> 01:21:26,864
Bronze dog bones? What?

1089
01:21:27,566 --> 01:21:31,798
Accordions?
Baby pictures, tricycles, kites?

1090
01:21:34,839 --> 01:21:36,067
Bowling trophies?

1091
01:21:36,241 --> 01:21:38,709
- You remember that, darling?
- our first date.

1092
01:21:41,012 --> 01:21:42,570
What is all of this crap?

1093
01:21:42,747 --> 01:21:44,772
These are our priceless possessions.

1094
01:21:44,950 --> 01:21:46,315
Where are the gold bars...

1095
01:21:46,484 --> 01:21:51,387
...the diamonds, negotiable bearer bonds,
the money? Where's the money?!

1096
01:21:51,556 --> 01:21:53,285
In banks, where else?

1097
01:21:53,458 --> 01:21:55,585
- And the stock market, real estate...
- No.

1098
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:57,728
Is this a joke? This is not right.

1099
01:21:57,896 --> 01:22:02,230
Are you telling me there is not one
single solitary gold bar or emerald...

1100
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:05,233
...or thousand-dollar bill
in this entire mountain?

1101
01:22:05,403 --> 01:22:08,372
I'm sorry, Laurence,
but that's not what we treasure.

1102
01:22:09,207 --> 01:22:10,765
Shoot them now, please.

1103
01:22:13,745 --> 01:22:16,714
What's the matter, Mr. van Dough?
Can't do it yourself?

1104
01:22:16,881 --> 01:22:19,076
- Richie, get out of here!
- It's okay, Mom.

1105
01:22:19,250 --> 01:22:21,275
I don't think he has the guts
to shoot.

1106
01:22:21,453 --> 01:22:22,852
Richie! No!

1107
01:22:23,588 --> 01:22:27,115
Generally, you're right,
but on this occasion...

1108
01:22:27,292 --> 01:22:29,089
...I think I'll make an exception.

1109
01:22:31,796 --> 01:22:33,024
Cool.

1110
01:22:41,339 --> 01:22:42,966
You're a dead man!

1111
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:49,879
Let's get out of here!

1112
01:22:51,349 --> 01:22:53,544
- Lock him in, Dad!
- Good idea, son!

1113
01:22:53,718 --> 01:22:57,677
- Close vault.
- <i>Closing vault now Have a nice day</i>

1114
01:23:07,966 --> 01:23:09,228
This way!

1115
01:23:28,019 --> 01:23:29,646
Up the ramp, quick.

1116
01:23:30,355 --> 01:23:31,947
oh, my God.

1117
01:23:32,824 --> 01:23:35,657
- It's all right, honey. Don't look down!
- oh, Jesus.

1118
01:23:57,315 --> 01:23:58,339
Don't look down!

1119
01:23:58,550 --> 01:23:59,915
I won't, darling.

1120
01:24:00,652 --> 01:24:02,085
Get down!

1121
01:24:03,455 --> 01:24:05,047
Down, down. Everybody down!

1122
01:24:05,256 --> 01:24:07,019
- He's trying to kill us!
- I know!

1123
01:24:19,571 --> 01:24:21,562
I got you now.

1124
01:24:24,242 --> 01:24:25,607
Stay down!

1125
01:24:27,212 --> 01:24:28,873
Quick! Up we go!

1126
01:24:29,047 --> 01:24:31,208
Not me, you imbecile! Them!

1127
01:24:32,617 --> 01:24:34,209
Beg your pardon.

1128
01:24:35,653 --> 01:24:37,086
That wasn't so difficult.

1129
01:24:38,590 --> 01:24:40,285
- Come on.
- Richard, I'm afraid!

1130
01:24:40,458 --> 01:24:42,858
But you're the bravest woman
I've ever known.

1131
01:24:43,027 --> 01:24:46,292
- Now up you go.
- Cut the crap and stop pushing!

1132
01:24:49,467 --> 01:24:50,866
Shit!

1133
01:25:24,903 --> 01:25:27,394
- All right, Richie, come on.
- Come on, Richie!

1134
01:25:29,207 --> 01:25:30,697
Good boy, son.
Good boy.

1135
01:25:30,875 --> 01:25:33,139
Now, don't look down.

1136
01:25:42,020 --> 01:25:43,453
Hang on!

1137
01:25:46,691 --> 01:25:47,953
Richard!

1138
01:25:55,433 --> 01:25:57,162
- Richard!
- Mom!

1139
01:26:11,616 --> 01:26:14,278
I've got you! I've got you!
Grab Richie's hand!

1140
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:16,919
- I got her!
- No!

1141
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:19,420
- Don't let go of me.
- We won't let you go.

1142
01:26:20,458 --> 01:26:23,825
Now, I won't let you go, dear.

1143
01:26:26,898 --> 01:26:29,662
- I'll swing you into my mouth.
- In your mouth?

1144
01:26:29,834 --> 01:26:31,631
- Your mouth?
- It's large enough.

1145
01:26:33,671 --> 01:26:34,968
- Ready?
- okay.

1146
01:26:35,139 --> 01:26:36,299
one.

1147
01:26:36,474 --> 01:26:38,203
- I can't hold her! Hurry!
- Two.

1148
01:26:38,376 --> 01:26:40,003
- She's slipping!
- once more.

1149
01:26:40,178 --> 01:26:41,406
Three!

1150
01:26:45,250 --> 01:26:47,184
- You okay?
- I made it!

1151
01:26:47,352 --> 01:26:49,013
All right. You're next.

1152
01:26:54,425 --> 01:26:55,824
Give me that!

Thank God!

Please. Please. Help me!

Dad, I know how you feel
about firing people, but...

In this case, I think
we can make an exception.

Fine, I'm fired...

1171
01:28:37,028 --> 01:28:38,996
Well done, Master Richie!

01:28:48,473 --> 01:28:50,668
...in a manner of speaking.

1177
01:28:58,449 --> 01:29:00,940
- Go get them, Richie!
- Come on, Richie!

1178
01:29:01,386 --> 01:29:03,217
- Come on, you can do it!
- Richie!

1179
01:29:03,388 --> 01:29:04,980
Come on, Richie!

1180
01:29:05,790 --> 01:29:08,224
Come on, kill that ball!

1181
01:29:08,393 --> 01:29:12,352
- Right down the middle!
- Come on! This guy can't hit!

1182
01:29:12,563 --> 01:29:14,190
Knock it out the park!

1183
01:29:25,910 --> 01:29:27,639
Well done! That's the ticket!

1184
01:29:32,550 --> 01:29:33,778
Good hit.

1185
01:29:33,951 --> 01:29:35,475
Shut up!

1186
01:29:36,020 --> 01:29:38,011
Aren't you gonna throw it back?

1187
01:29:44,028 --> 01:29:46,963
Hey, screw. Fetch.

1188
01:29:54,072 --> 01:29:56,165
Not bad, coach.

1189
01:29:56,340 --> 01:29:58,240
You're not so bad yourself, madam.

1190
01:29:58,443 --> 01:30:00,343
Don't call me that.

1191
01:30:00,945 --> 01:30:02,742
Richie, you're all right.

1192
01:30:02,914 --> 01:30:04,609
Likewise.

1193
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:19,855
I must say, Regina...

1194
01:30:20,031 --> 01:30:23,364
...now our son really
is the richest boy in the world.

1195
01:30:23,534 --> 01:30:25,525
He has friends.

1196
01:34:17,935 --> 01:34:19,926
