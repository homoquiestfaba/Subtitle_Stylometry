00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,873
(Multicom Jingle)

2
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,370
(gentle music)

3
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,670
- [Narrator] Although certain
characters and incidents

4
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,530
have been fictionalized,

5
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,233
this film was inspired by an actual event.

6
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:11,084
(horn honking)

7
00:01:15,897 --> 00:01:17,141
(people chattering)

8
00:01:17,141 --> 00:01:22,141
(upbeat band music)
(crowd chattering)

9
00:01:41,725 --> 00:01:43,012
- How you doin'?

10
00:01:43,012 --> 00:01:44,091
- Hi, alright.

11
00:01:44,091 --> 00:01:47,258
(marching band music)

12
00:02:05,437 --> 00:02:07,233
- [Man] I think they all look good.

13
00:02:07,233 --> 00:02:09,344
I'm glad they're home.

14
00:02:09,344 --> 00:02:10,177
Yes, sir.

15
00:02:10,177 --> 00:02:11,010
- Hi, mama.

16
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:11,843
- Hi.

17
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:19,433
Well, I just wanted to sneak
a peak at you in your uniform,

18
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,050
make sure you got home
safely in one piece.

19
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,105
That's all.

20
00:02:26,105 --> 00:02:28,325
- Glad you're here.

21
00:02:28,325 --> 00:02:29,825
- I certainly took my chances.

22
00:02:30,681 --> 00:02:32,981
Had to figure that your
pa weren't gonna show.

23
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,220
- I never seen you lookin' so pretty.

24
00:02:38,481 --> 00:02:39,314
- Well, you keep talkin' like that,

25
00:02:39,314 --> 00:02:41,220
and I'll be cryin' my
Mary Kay peachy blush

26
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,120
right off my face.

27
00:02:44,245 --> 00:02:45,078
- No.

28
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,450
Please, mama.

29
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:48,320
Mama, don't.

30
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,743
- Sorry, I can't help it.

31
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,343
I've been prayin' so hard for this moment,

32
00:02:56,185 --> 00:02:57,235
hopin' it would come.

33
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:01,123
All it took was seven years and a war.

34
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,880
- There's nothin' you could do, mama.

35
00:03:05,589 --> 00:03:07,639
I mean, there's nothin' anybody could do.

36
00:03:10,513 --> 00:03:12,820
Are you gonna offer a
tired soldier a ride home,

37
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,697
or am I walkin'?

38
00:03:14,637 --> 00:03:16,887
(laughing)

39
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,860
Well, pa didn't write me one time

40
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,520
the whole time I was over there.

41
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,223
Got 36 letters from you, though.

42
00:03:23,223 --> 00:03:26,020
- [Sally] I've still got two in my purse.

43
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,532
- [Jody] I can't believe
that plant's still standin'.

44
00:03:28,532 --> 00:03:29,365
- You look so thin.

45
00:03:29,365 --> 00:03:31,403
What's they feed you in
Saudi Arabia, anyway?

46
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,213
- [Jody] Mama, pull over.

47
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,637
I wanna ask you somethin'.

48
00:03:34,637 --> 00:03:35,660
- Smack in front of McCade?

49
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,240
They see me, they come pourin' outta there

50
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,380
like a bunch of porcupines
lookin' for a dartboard.

51
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,530
- There ain't nothin' they can do to you

52
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,783
they ain't done already.

53
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,100
One thing bein' over taught me was

54
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,350
you gotta look the enemy
straight in the eye.

55
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:59,440
- Nobody said nothin'
about gettin' outta no car.

56
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,633
Jody.

57
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,373
Jody.

58
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:06,954
Oh, shoot.

59
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:22,722
- You know, I still have nightmares

60
00:04:22,722 --> 00:04:23,960
about what they done to you.

61
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,983
- Hey well what's done is done.

62
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,350
Ain't nothin' gonna ever change that.

63
00:04:32,844 --> 00:04:35,011
- You wanna talk about it?

64
00:04:36,592 --> 00:04:41,592
- I can't.

65
00:04:41,707 --> 00:04:43,280
I just can't.

66
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,113
- Please?

67
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,053
I've waited seven years.

68
00:04:49,493 --> 00:04:53,150
(emotional music)

69
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,650
Well then, if you're not gonna tell me,

70
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,080
I guess I'm just gonna
have to hold my breath

71
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,013
'til I turn blue.

72
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:03,390
- Well, can't have you
turnin' blue, too, can I?

73
00:05:06,805 --> 00:05:09,203
You know blue used to
be my favorite color.

74
00:05:11,873 --> 00:05:14,090
They sure took care of that, didn't they?

75
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,803
After I lost you,

76
00:05:17,665 --> 00:05:19,915
I didn't think anything
could hurt me as bad.

77
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:24,803
But I was wrong.

78
00:05:25,989 --> 00:05:30,989
(crew chattering)
(machinery clanging)

79
00:05:32,829 --> 00:05:34,455
- Hey, Travis, they want you down

80
00:05:34,455 --> 00:05:36,043
at the gas Hurley down there

81
00:05:36,043 --> 00:05:37,395
at the the tower.

82
00:05:37,395 --> 00:05:38,228
- Right.

83
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:45,150
- [Worker] Right in the
middle of my work space here.

84
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,160
- Y'all take a break yet?

85
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,577
- Huh-uh.
- Take it now.

86
00:05:51,609 --> 00:05:53,280
- [Worker] Now roll that on outside.

87
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,177
- 40 pounds too much for you, girl?

88
00:05:55,177 --> 00:05:56,527
- [Sally] No, I can manage.

89
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,730
- Take a hike, Hank.

90
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,493
- You hold them trays
away from your hooters

91
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,520
when you lift 'em, you hear?

92
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,650
You keep touchin' 'em
with these compounds,

93
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,760
don't come cryin' to me when you get hurt.

94
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,210
- You better not get any ideas
about touchin' 'em, Hank,

95
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:12,060
or I'll have the union on your
butt like a runaway train.

96
00:06:13,115 --> 00:06:15,390
- I'm just tryin' to be helpful, girl.

97
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,767
- [Naomi] Helpful, my ass.

98
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:20,863
- I cannot believe you
talk to him that way.

99
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,258
- You just got here.

100
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,480
It's only your first week.

101
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,080
I used to be a shy flower
when I first started, too.

102
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:33,400
He knows damn well nobody, man or woman,

103
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,530
can lift 200 trays a day.

104
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:37,230
Just lift them whichever way you can.

105
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,200
- Oh, it's okay.

106
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,810
Tough enough gettin' this job.

107
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:43,523
I ain't gonna give them
any excuse to fire me.

108
00:06:57,718 --> 00:07:00,385
(door slamming)

109
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,253
- [Clark] Hey.

110
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,320
- Dinner's almost ready.

111
00:07:07,857 --> 00:07:11,530
(television droning)

112
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,242
- What's this here?

113
00:07:13,242 --> 00:07:16,510
- That is my very first
paycheck from McCade Industries.

114
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,222
- $264?

115
00:07:18,222 --> 00:07:21,000
- $343.50 before taxes.

116
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,430
I can't believe it used to take me a month

117
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,090
to earn that much down at the coffee shop.

118
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:28,930
- Shoot, it's $80 more
than I made last week.

119
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:29,763
- Oh, yeah?

120
00:07:29,763 --> 00:07:31,507
Someday you're gonna own
that fillin' station.

121
00:07:31,507 --> 00:07:34,030
You ain't always gonna be
punchin' a time clock like me.

122
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:37,023
Jody, get in here and turn
off the TV, dinner's ready.

123
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:38,773
- Canned hash?

124
00:07:38,773 --> 00:07:40,570
- Well, I didn't have time to do shoppin'.

125
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:41,950
I wanted to make you pork chops.

126
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,213
- Oh, you know what I think?

127
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,010
I think we was all better off

128
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:47,200
when you was still a waitress.

129
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,033
Right, Jody?

130
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:51,663
Well, he's your boy, all right.

131
00:07:51,663 --> 00:07:53,220
He can't even offer up an opinion.

132
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,120
- Don't start with him, Clark, please.

133
00:07:55,974 --> 00:07:57,478
(machinery whirring)

134
00:07:57,478 --> 00:07:58,311
- [Worker] Shut 'er down.

135
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,811
- [Worker] Got it.

136
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,320
- Take my sister Laura for instance.

137
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,720
She popped a baby every
year for the last eight,

138
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,000
and I ain't even had one.

139
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,930
- Oh, it'll come, honey,
when you least expect it.

140
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,013
Every time we try, nothin' happens.

141
00:08:12,013 --> 00:08:14,664
Every time we didn't, we had one.

142
00:08:14,664 --> 00:08:15,497
(woman chuckling)

143
00:08:15,497 --> 00:08:16,946
John still wants a boy.

144
00:08:16,946 --> 00:08:19,213
Not enough hands to do the chores.

145
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:21,250
What about you, Sally?

146
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,320
You want another?

147
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,173
- Me, I want a whole house full.

148
00:08:24,173 --> 00:08:26,200
Doesn't seem to be in the cards, though,

149
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,147
not the way me and my
husband have been gettin' on.

150
00:08:29,147 --> 00:08:30,657
- Some's got lots of children.

151
00:08:30,657 --> 00:08:32,660
Some's got lots of money.

152
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,302
Them's got both find somethin'
else to complain about.

153
00:08:35,302 --> 00:08:38,634
Y'all don't because me,
watch Oprah for five minutes.

154
00:08:38,634 --> 00:08:40,296
- See it on whose TV?

155
00:08:40,296 --> 00:08:43,180
My husband I still savin' up
for a used washin' machine.

156
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,670
Georgia, quit hoggin' the soap.

157
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,960
- Well, there's somethin'
the matter with it.

158
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,060
- Here, hand it to me.

159
00:08:48,966 --> 00:08:51,040
Ah, look at that, you see,
they watered it down again.

160
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,350
- Yeah, you think they'd let
us know we ain't wanted here.

161
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:56,243
- They either bein' cheap
or nasty, take your pick.

162
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,923
- What they are bein' is disrespectful.

163
00:09:04,446 --> 00:09:06,234
- [Woman] Who's gettin'
an eyeful this time?

164
00:09:06,234 --> 00:09:07,734
- [Woman] Glory be, will you look at that?

165
00:09:07,734 --> 00:09:11,350
- Ladies, I think I see
a cockroach over here.

166
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,099
(women crying out)

167
00:09:13,099 --> 00:09:14,618
- I'm so scared.
- Oh, my god.

168
00:09:14,618 --> 00:09:15,772
(women chattering)

169
00:09:15,772 --> 00:09:17,378
- [Woman] I can't believe
that, look at that thing.

170
00:09:17,378 --> 00:09:19,150
- Sally, come see this roach.

171
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,094
- [Woman] I can't believe.

172
00:09:20,094 --> 00:09:20,927
I bet it's the new

173
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:21,893
(speaking drowned out)
- You ain't afraid

174
00:09:21,893 --> 00:09:22,882
of cockroaches, are you?

175
00:09:22,882 --> 00:09:24,774
- Scary lookin'.
- Come on, Sally.

176
00:09:24,774 --> 00:09:25,820
- Ooh.
(women chattering)

177
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,514
- Come on, you're the
new full 'round here.

178
00:09:28,514 --> 00:09:30,482
You can do the honors.
- Sally, come on over here.

179
00:09:30,482 --> 00:09:31,550
- Just take this bottle and squeeze,

180
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,602
and holler marry Christmas.

181
00:09:33,602 --> 00:09:35,282
- Ooh, oh.
- Biggest one I ever saw.

182
00:09:35,282 --> 00:09:36,374
- I've never seen a bug like...
- Be sure to get it.

183
00:09:36,374 --> 00:09:37,470
Right there.
- Looked like...

184
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,940
- Go on.

185
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,773
- Go on, Sally.

186
00:09:39,773 --> 00:09:41,282
- There it is.
- Yes!

187
00:09:41,282 --> 00:09:43,304
(women cheering)
(women laughing)

188
00:09:43,304 --> 00:09:45,540
- I can't believe I just did that.

189
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,097
- You get a gold star.

190
00:09:48,636 --> 00:09:53,636
(Sally coughing)
(ominous music)

191
00:09:54,847 --> 00:09:56,513
- Sally, I want you to quit.

192
00:09:57,876 --> 00:09:58,726
- I need a towel.

193
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,590
- My god, you're coughin' this
crap up all over the place.

194
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:03,903
- I'll clean it up.

195
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:07,220
Naomi says we wouldn't
be havin' these problems

196
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,367
if we got better respirators.

197
00:10:08,367 --> 00:10:11,736
- You wouldn't be havin' this
problem if you would quit.

198
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,220
Now, you shower off before
you come back to bed.

199
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,150
I'm tired of you leavin' this mess

200
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,080
on the sheets every night.

201
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,812
- I could shower from here
to kingdom come, Clark.

202
00:10:17,812 --> 00:10:19,750
It wouldn't make no difference.

203
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,690
People's retired says
when you leave the plant,

204
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,420
you sweat color for a year.

205
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,533
- [Clark] Just do it.

206
00:10:32,736 --> 00:10:36,908
(whistle blowing)
(crowd cheering)

207
00:10:36,908 --> 00:10:38,408
- Go, Jody.

208
00:10:38,408 --> 00:10:39,325
- Go, Jody.

209
00:10:40,176 --> 00:10:41,009
My god.

210
00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:42,516
God, he's gotten so big.

211
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:43,972
- Get him, son.

212
00:10:43,972 --> 00:10:45,417
- [Spectator] Come on, come on.

213
00:10:45,417 --> 00:10:47,700
- He just flipped him on his stomach, pa.

214
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,430
Come on, Jody, pin him.

215
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:51,593
- Put mule in the barn, boy.

216
00:10:52,548 --> 00:10:54,330
(whistle blowing)

217
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,840
- Looking good!

218
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,973
Way to go, Jody!

219
00:10:59,173 --> 00:11:01,696
(boy groaning)
(whistle blowing)

220
00:11:01,696 --> 00:11:02,540
- He's wimpin' out.

221
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,663
- He's doin' fine.

222
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,650
- He's got nothin' left.

223
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,650
He never does when he needs it the most.

224
00:11:12,136 --> 00:11:13,874
(crowd shouting)

225
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:15,104
(whistle blowing)

226
00:11:15,104 --> 00:11:16,532
(buzzer sounding)

227
00:11:16,532 --> 00:11:19,449
(crowd applauding)

228
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:26,860
- It's okay, Jody, it's okay.

229
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,220
- I don't wanna hear any
more of your lame excuses.

230
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,712
You get down on your all fours, quick.

231
00:11:31,712 --> 00:11:33,960
- [Jody] Pa, I'm studyin'.

232
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,013
- Wait, what are you doin'?

233
00:11:35,013 --> 00:11:36,900
- He's gonna learn a thing or two

234
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,733
about wrestlin', that's what.

235
00:11:37,733 --> 00:11:38,566
- Oh, he ain't got time for this.

236
00:11:38,566 --> 00:11:39,570
Jody, you get yourself back to work.

237
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:40,490
You got an English test tomorrow.

238
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,810
- You put a lid on it,
and you get down now.

239
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:43,790
- Yes sir.

240
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,790
- Aw, come on, Clark, don't be ridiculous.

241
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:49,200
- No son of mine is gonna
wrestle like a girl.

242
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,033
- Ow.
- You fight.

243
00:11:50,033 --> 00:11:51,528
- Ah, ow, ow.
- And you fight like a man.

244
00:11:51,528 --> 00:11:52,361
- It hurts.
- Stop it, Clark.

245
00:11:52,361 --> 00:11:53,410
Don't be ridiculous.

246
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,673
- Shut your face.

247
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,690
- Clark, please, leave him alone.

248
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,720
He's just a little boy.

249
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,580
- Learn to fight.

250
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,380
- Stop it, it hurts, ow.

251
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,440
- Oh, my god, Clark, please, stop it.

252
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,280
(fist cracking)
(Sally groaning)

253
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,972
Jody, you run to Billy's house.

254
00:12:06,972 --> 00:12:07,869
- No, mama.
- And you stay there.

255
00:12:07,869 --> 00:12:08,952
- Clark, get off.

256
00:12:08,952 --> 00:12:09,954
- I said to get.

257
00:12:09,954 --> 00:12:11,424
- Don't hit her no more, pa.

258
00:12:11,424 --> 00:12:12,257
- Go.

259
00:12:12,257 --> 00:12:13,090
Now.

260
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,660
(lamp crashing)

261
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,350
(machinery clanging)

262
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:18,400
- You better put some ice on that shiner.

263
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,643
- Will you quit starin' at me like that.

264
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:28,610
You think your husband never
laid a finger on you before?

265
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:29,457
- No.

266
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,140
And if he ever got any ideas,

267
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,650
I'd have no qualms about
pullin' his smelly socks

268
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:36,740
above his head, tyin' him up,
and smotherin' him to death.

269
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,573
Look at you.

270
00:12:37,573 --> 00:12:38,540
You shouldn't even be working.

271
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,250
- Yeah, well, I ain't got
much of a choice, do I?

272
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,560
- Yes, you do.

273
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,060
You could get rid of that SOB.

274
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,850
- Well, it wasn't always this bad.

275
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,000
- Well, it's bad now.

276
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,833
Sally, we don't have to take it

277
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,100
just 'cause our grandmas did.

278
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,553
We allowed to be happy, too.

279
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,613
- Jody makes me happy.

280
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,352
- [Hank] Roy, I said I come
down here to talk to you.

281
00:13:02,352 --> 00:13:04,680
(speaking drowned out by noise)

282
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,492
You've got to take some time off.

283
00:13:06,492 --> 00:13:08,867
- [Roy] I was just off
two weeks before Easter.

284
00:13:08,867 --> 00:13:11,097
- [Hank] Yeah, and the levels
have got to be brought down.

285
00:13:11,097 --> 00:13:12,800
- Was it lead poisonin'?

286
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,930
- No, that's in pavement.

287
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:16,443
They say it's somethin' else,

288
00:13:16,443 --> 00:13:18,900
some other kind of compound
that's just as bad.

289
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,513
Probably worse, if I know them.

290
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,620
- You ever get forced leave?

291
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,170
- Yeah.

292
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:27,900
They said the toxins was
stickin' to my lipstick.

293
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,940
- We took care of them levels last time.

294
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:30,773
- They are up.

295
00:13:30,773 --> 00:13:31,830
We are gonna deal with it.

296
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,280
And you've got to pack it in.

297
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,730
Naomi, come over here and take
over for Roy on this packer.

298
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:38,980
I need somebody who
knows what they're doin'.

299
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:43,250
- Somebody must have treated
him real good last night.

300
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,160
That's the closest thing
to a compliment he paid me

301
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,490
ever since I've been here.

302
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:48,247
I'll hop right on it, sweet pea.

303
00:13:50,353 --> 00:13:51,930
- Sally.

304
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:54,350
You think you can handle this by yourself?

305
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,183
- Yeah.

306
00:13:59,577 --> 00:14:00,957
- You know them hooters of yours

307
00:14:00,957 --> 00:14:03,160
are lookin' flatter than usual.

308
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,090
You sure you haven't been
puttin' them compound trays

309
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:06,580
up against them when I ain't been lookin'.

310
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,513
- Hey, Hank, that ain't no
way to be talkin' to a lady.

311
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,550
- You ought to know, boy.

312
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,233
You're divorced, aren't you?

313
00:14:16,835 --> 00:14:19,130
- That's the second time in a
week somebody's bailed me out

314
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:19,963
with that man.

315
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:22,650
Sally Thompson.

316
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,340
Thanks go out to you.

317
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,941
- Think you better sit out this round.

318
00:14:26,941 --> 00:14:29,337
- No, no, no, I can't let you do that.

319
00:14:29,337 --> 00:14:30,207
It ain't right.

320
00:14:30,207 --> 00:14:33,374
You're gonna get us both into trouble.

321
00:14:35,053 --> 00:14:37,367
- I ain't gonna say
nothin' to you about it,

322
00:14:37,367 --> 00:14:38,330
but I ain't gonna pretend

323
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:40,780
like I don't see what's
been done to you neither.

324
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:46,100
- My brother'd still be workin' for McCade

325
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,900
if it weren't for that
fumb equal opportunity law

326
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,800
about hiring women.

327
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,690
- No, your brother would
still be workin' here

328
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,810
if he'd been doin' his
drinkin' in the right places

329
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:53,923
instead of on the job.

330
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,350
- All I know is, is perfume
and compound don't mix.

331
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,560
- You know what I think?

332
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,690
I think you're raggin' on 'em

333
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,250
'cause you're scared for your own neck.

334
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,590
Heck, everybody here
knows productivity is up

335
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,060
since they was hired on.

336
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,410
- Not enough to save this sinkin' ship.

337
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,340
I heard there's new talk
about closin' us down.

338
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,810
- Hell, they've been
closin' this place down

339
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:15,783
and movin' this shindig to
Mexico since before we was born.

340
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,403
- Strawberry rhubarb.

341
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,017
Strawberry's frozen,
but the rhubarb's fresh.

342
00:15:22,017 --> 00:15:27,017
Got plastic knives here, forks, and enjoy.

343
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,340
- Well, thank you.

344
00:15:31,117 --> 00:15:33,900
Seein' as how you feel
about women the way you do,

345
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,173
you don't mind if I just hog
this all for myself, do you?

346
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,510
- Well, what are you lookin' at?

347
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,270
Gotta start somewhere.

348
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,279
- I love banana cream.

349
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,331
(women laughing)

350
00:15:52,331 --> 00:15:53,810
- I got news for you.

351
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,640
It's gonna take a whole lot of pie

352
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,873
to make us one big happy
family around here.

353
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:59,880
- Guess what?

354
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,080
A mandatory meeting's
been called for us women

355
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,350
right after work.

356
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,760
It's with Dr. Mason.

357
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,130
- Dr. Mason?

358
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:09,447
- What's she gonna do,
hand out tongue depressors?

359
00:16:09,447 --> 00:16:11,410
(women laughing)

360
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:14,020
- After a comprehensive
study of compound divisions

361
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,280
in facilities across the nation,

362
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,900
the findings show that certain substances

363
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:23,900
women are exposed to could
endanger a developing fetus.

364
00:16:23,939 --> 00:16:25,600
- About time they got us some proper gear.

365
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,360
- Therefore, the company has adopted

366
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,033
the following fetal protection policy.

367
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:36,390
All women of childbearing
years, ages 15 to 60,

368
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,650
who work in hazardous areas

369
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:41,518
must undergo a sterilization operation.

370
00:16:41,518 --> 00:16:43,590
(women chattering)
- Sterilization?

371
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:46,420
- Or be terminated from their current job.

372
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,820
- What?
- What?

373
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,991
- Of course, if you've
already had a hysterectomy

374
00:16:49,991 --> 00:16:52,710
or have written proof of sterility,

375
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:55,110
there is nothing further required.

376
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:57,080
Dr. Mason here will be
happy to field questions

377
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,390
if you have any.

378
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,563
Thank you.

379
00:16:59,563 --> 00:17:00,490
- Oh, no, no, no, no, wait a minute.

380
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,339
Do I got this straight?

381
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:03,172
- [Woman] That's not right.

382
00:17:03,172 --> 00:17:05,490
- We have to give up our
ability to have children

383
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:08,090
so that we can continue
to work in this cesspool?

384
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:10,500
- I know this is difficult.

385
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,070
- Why don't they just clean up the plant

386
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,330
like they're supposed to?

387
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:14,530
- I'll tell you why,

388
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,160
because there ain't
enough of us workin' here

389
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,340
for them to spend the
money to make it safe.

390
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,173
- Y'all are doin' this 'cause you know

391
00:17:19,173 --> 00:17:21,060
we ain't got no place else to go.

392
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,820
- My husband uses protection.

393
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,110
Isn't that enough?

394
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:27,030
- I'm afraid it's not considered reliable.

395
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,370
- Well, what if we go on the pill?

396
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:31,030
- [Dr. Mason] What if
you forget to take it?

397
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:33,400
- What if we promise not to sue?

398
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,670
You know, sign some sort of agreement?

399
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:38,720
- I asked the same question
to our legal people,

400
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,410
and there's just too many loopholes.

401
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,070
- So what have we gotta do?

402
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:45,270
- Well, the operation
is a routine procedure

403
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,830
called a tubal ligation.

404
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,300
- Routine for who?

405
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,220
- You're in and out of the
hospital in three days.

406
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,070
Recovery period is six weeks.

407
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:56,230
The company will foot the bill.

408
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,420
- Well, that's generous.

409
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:02,553
- You have 30 days to make your decision.

410
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:08,900
- 30 days to choose
between starvin' to death

411
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,973
or havin' a child.

412
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,930
Well, that's quite a decision, ain't it?

413
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:24,940
But that ain't really the point, Clark.

414
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,690
- I mean, how good's a
boy's English gotta be

415
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,523
for pumpin' gas?

416
00:18:29,523 --> 00:18:32,010
- Well, I know you like
workin' at the fillin' station.

417
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:35,910
But maybe Jody wants to do somethin' else?

418
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:38,640
- Good enough for me,
it's good enough for him.

419
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,693
Right, Miss Gates?

420
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,990
- We were talking about Jody's grades.

421
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,172
- I wanna see you outside.

422
00:18:44,172 --> 00:18:45,183
Excuse us, please.

423
00:18:45,183 --> 00:18:46,183
- Of course.

424
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:51,563
- Clark.

425
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:52,396
- I don't care.

426
00:18:53,343 --> 00:18:55,170
You contradicted me in front
of that teacher of his.

427
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,270
- Give up.

428
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,950
You and me are turnin'
out to be as different

429
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,177
as molasses and vinegar.

430
00:18:59,177 --> 00:19:00,582
- Oh, what the hell are you talkin' about?

431
00:19:00,582 --> 00:19:01,797
- Just forget it.

432
00:19:01,797 --> 00:19:03,640
- No, you got somethin'
to say, you say it.

433
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,420
- It ain't even worth discussin'.

434
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,570
It's stupid of me to think

435
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,380
you'd even wanna have another child.

436
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,213
- You're damn straight,

437
00:19:09,213 --> 00:19:11,280
you can put it right outta your head.

438
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,870
Comes waltzin' in at six
o'clock after some plant meeting

439
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,470
like she's got nothin' better to do,

440
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:18,150
and you expect to have
another mouth to feed.

441
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,760
What's so important they
gotta have a meetin'

442
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,371
at that plant anyway?

443
00:19:21,371 --> 00:19:23,093
- Ain't nothin' that you'd care about.

444
00:19:26,493 --> 00:19:29,359
(train chugging)

445
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:31,440
- Well, they got all them doctors

446
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,373
and scientists workin' for 'em.

447
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,270
What I mean is they must
know what they're doin'.

448
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,103
- You're kiddin' me.

449
00:19:37,103 --> 00:19:39,010
Do you have any idea what
you're talkin' about here?

450
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:41,780
- Come on, everybody's
gonna have their turn.

451
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,160
- Chris, all I'm tryin' to say

452
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,050
is it don't matter much to me anymore.

453
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:48,330
I'm gettin' kinda old
to have kids, anyway.

454
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:49,717
That's it, I'm done.

455
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,020
- Georgia?

456
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,713
- It's kind of personal.

457
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,680
I don't know if I should
be talkin' about it.

458
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,690
- Now, come on now, Georgia.

459
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:01,163
Now, nobody's gonna judge ya.

460
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:07,170
- Well, see, Tommy's
brother, he's kinda slow.

461
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:09,640
Well, mentally and all.

462
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,530
So we decided we wouldn't
even try to have kids.

463
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:17,003
I mean, in my heart, I know it's wrong,

464
00:20:17,003 --> 00:20:18,750
(melancholy music)

465
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,510
but I'm not gonna fight it.

466
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,380
- I can't just sit here
and listen to this,

467
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,160
watch my whole life go down the drain.

468
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:24,993
- Well, then you oughta quit.

469
00:20:24,993 --> 00:20:26,000
- And do what?

470
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,940
Have a baby and give it up for adoption

471
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,010
when we can't afford to keep it?

472
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:32,300
We know there's no work
in this whole damn town.

473
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,150
We've all looked.

474
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,810
I can't believe it was just the other day

475
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:39,350
we was all in here, in this very room,

476
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,515
talkin' about havin' kids.

477
00:20:41,515 --> 00:20:42,510
- I know.

478
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:45,510
It's like the devil got off the
bus on his way back to hell.

479
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:49,563
Sally, we haven't heard from you yet.

480
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,653
- You know I was only 15 when I had Jody.

481
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:58,179
And I'll admit, these
years have been tough.

482
00:20:58,179 --> 00:20:59,869
Yeah, they've been tough on all of us.

483
00:20:59,869 --> 00:21:03,853
But I love my boy more than life itself.

484
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:07,430
I can't imagine givin' up
my chances to have another,

485
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:09,710
even though children is a sore point

486
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,053
with my husband right now.

487
00:21:13,127 --> 00:21:14,377
It just don't seem right.

488
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,283
- You know what I think?

489
00:21:18,283 --> 00:21:20,645
I think they's puttin' one over on us.

490
00:21:20,645 --> 00:21:22,430
And I'm gonna find out.

491
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:23,473
See y'all later.

492
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,823
- So you remember how nasty things got.

493
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,500
How many of you were with
McCade during the last strike?

494
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,860
- I was there.
- Oh, I was.

495
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,000
- Well, there are still folks

496
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,360
who haven't completely
recovered their losses.

497
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,530
And there are still folks
who are askin' themselves,

498
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,570
was it worth it goin' out over 50 cents?

499
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:43,560
- [Woman] Oh, come on.

500
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,653
- I think it was.

501
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,500
Others think they would
have got the increase anyway

502
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,683
over time without the help of the union.

503
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,210
It's a tough call.

504
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,100
- Is this a tough call?

505
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,630
- Well, I can't answer that

506
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:57,750
without launchin' a
complete investigation.

507
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,930
- Well, are you willin' to?

508
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:02,800
- [Dave] It's not me, it's the union.

509
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,690
- All right.

510
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,820
Is the union willing to?

511
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,410
- The union is workin' for you.

512
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:08,780
You should never forget that.

513
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:11,920
- Like the time we lobbied
for our own bathroom.

514
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,330
We had to use one in another building,

515
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:15,180
nearly half a mile away.

516
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,970
How long did that go on, Dave?

517
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:19,200
- A year, and it would
have gone on forever,

518
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,510
except one of those girls' husbands

519
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,410
was a plumber and did it for free.

520
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:24,420
- If you couldn't even
get us our own bathroom,

521
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,632
how do you expect to help us here.

522
00:22:26,632 --> 00:22:28,252
- Yeah.
- Right.

523
00:22:28,252 --> 00:22:29,730
(women chattering)

524
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,773
- 'Cause this is more important.

525
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:35,093
Right, Dave?

526
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:39,953
- Right.

527
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,720
(telephone ringing)

528
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:51,450
- Well, they got two jobs
available in converters

529
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:53,470
and one in the supervisor's office.

530
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,660
But these are all gonna go to those

531
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,250
with the highest seniority.

532
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,780
- And you know that ain't one of us.

533
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,420
- I wish we could move to another town.

534
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,450
- Sure, you and everybody
else in McCade County.

535
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:03,270
You know they let go of 200 men over at

536
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,363
Stone Rivers this mornin'.
- How'd you make out

537
00:23:04,363 --> 00:23:05,393
with the union?

538
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,780
- They workin' on it.

539
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,613
- Yeah, well, I was you,

540
00:23:09,613 --> 00:23:11,610
I wouldn't go puttin' off the inevitable.

541
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,716
Sometimes the company
gets a little squirrely,

542
00:23:14,716 --> 00:23:16,636
you know what I mean?

543
00:23:16,636 --> 00:23:18,254
You come 'ere, I wanna talk to you.

544
00:23:18,254 --> 00:23:19,156
Come on.

545
00:23:19,156 --> 00:23:21,520
- Is this your idea of a date, Hank?

546
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,415
- They're watchin' you.

547
00:23:23,415 --> 00:23:24,510
You know there's nothin' you can do or say

548
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:27,023
that don't get back to
the big boys in spades.

549
00:23:28,636 --> 00:23:30,160
- Well, I'm just fightin'
for what's right.

550
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,132
- I'm not gonna be able to
bail you out this time, Naomi.

551
00:23:33,132 --> 00:23:34,210
I ain't.

552
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:35,587
Now, you better get off
that high horse of yours

553
00:23:35,587 --> 00:23:37,403
before they kick your butt.

554
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,433
Let me tell you somethin'.

555
00:23:39,433 --> 00:23:40,930
They haven't forgotten
all that ruckus you raised

556
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:42,710
about bringin' women into
this plant in the first place.

557
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:45,300
Besides, you got a husband workin'

558
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,650
the night shift, don't you?

559
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,160
- What's Henry gotta do with it?

560
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,838
- Slim pickins out there.

561
00:23:52,838 --> 00:23:54,938
Hard enough to get one job, let alone two.

562
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,386
- Are you threatenin' me, Hank?

563
00:23:58,386 --> 00:23:59,219
- No.

564
00:24:00,834 --> 00:24:02,313
I'm just deliverin' the message.

565
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:14,180
- You know, I know that
English ain't easy, sweetheart.

566
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,130
Heck, if it was, we'd all be president.

567
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:20,000
- Did you ever wish you
had a different teacher

568
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,103
when you was my age?

569
00:24:22,298 --> 00:24:24,293
- Of course, we all did.

570
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,360
Why?

571
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,197
You wishin'?

572
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,570
- See, Mrs. Gates ain't from around here.

573
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:33,622
She got a funny way of speakin' and all.

574
00:24:33,622 --> 00:24:36,130
I can't hardly understand
her most of the time.

575
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:37,790
- Most of 'em in this whole country

576
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:39,340
don't speak the way that we do.

577
00:24:41,154 --> 00:24:43,604
But you best listen to
what Mrs. Gates tells you.

578
00:24:46,178 --> 00:24:49,090
You don't get stuck here
the rest of your life

579
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,378
like I did.

580
00:24:50,378 --> 00:24:51,823
- But I like it here.

581
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,313
- I know you do.

582
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,550
It's just that I want you
to have choices, Jody.

583
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:00,230
It's real important.

584
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:04,137
I don't want you to get backed
into a corner like we did.

585
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:08,678
(pot crashing)

586
00:25:08,678 --> 00:25:11,595
- Did you get cornered here, Sally?

587
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:25,240
(telephone ringing)

588
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,073
- Yeah?

589
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,793
It's for you.

590
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:35,423
- Hello?

591
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,243
Hi, Paul.

592
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:40,810
What?

593
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:42,640
Oh my.
(gasps)

594
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,820
No, I'll be right there.

595
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,823
I'll be right there.

596
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,270
Just stop your worryin'

597
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,863
about the medical expenses, all right.

598
00:25:48,863 --> 00:25:50,530
I got some rainy day money saved at home.

599
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:51,473
- No, thank you.

600
00:25:52,444 --> 00:25:54,480
This is my own damn fault.

601
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,910
I didn't put the mat down
gettin' out of the shower.

602
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,800
- Lucky that sink broke her fall,

603
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,670
otherwise it might've messed
up that pretty face of hers.

604
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:04,140
- Oh, what do you know about pretty.

605
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,293
You ain't seen my face in years.

606
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,223
- Mom.

607
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:13,330
You could've done it all over again,

608
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:16,700
would you have had the four of us?

609
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,217
- What kind of question is
that to be askin' your mama?

610
00:26:19,217 --> 00:26:21,680
- All I remember is us bein' poor

611
00:26:22,822 --> 00:26:24,720
and wearin' each other's
clothes until they was shot,

612
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,670
and the two of you never havin'
no time to come up for air.

613
00:26:28,762 --> 00:26:29,620
Now that all the work's done

614
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,400
and everybody's gone
their own separate ways,

615
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:36,006
we're hardly a family anymore,
except for Thanksgiving.

616
00:26:36,006 --> 00:26:38,010
- For every one of the Thanksgivings,

617
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:40,310
I thank God for the lot of you.

618
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:43,880
I wouldn't trade my family off
for nothin', especially you.

619
00:26:52,462 --> 00:26:53,295
(telephone ringing)

620
00:26:53,295 --> 00:26:54,610
- [Staff] Dr. Taylor, report
to pediatrics, please.

621
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:56,520
- Hello, Sally.
- Dr. Taylor

622
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,353
to pediatrics, please.

623
00:26:57,353 --> 00:26:58,186
- I'm Mike Yates, I'm Erma's husband.

624
00:26:58,186 --> 00:26:59,019
- Oh, that's right.
- We met at the plant picnic.

625
00:26:59,019 --> 00:27:00,980
- I'm sorry, my memory
ain't worth a damn lately.

626
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,250
- That's understandable with
what's happenin' and all.

627
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:04,093
You just gettin' out?

628
00:27:04,093 --> 00:27:05,663
- Gettin' out?

629
00:27:05,663 --> 00:27:09,150
No, no, my mama fell and broke her hip.

630
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:10,910
- For a minute, I thought
you were a super human,

631
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:12,700
walkin' outta here like that.

632
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,730
They're bringin' Erma
down in a wheelchair.

633
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:17,823
Of course, she's had some complications.

634
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:20,560
Oh, hey, darlin'.

635
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,100
Could you keep her company
while I fetch the car?

636
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,095
- Yeah.

637
00:27:27,095 --> 00:27:27,928
Yeah.

638
00:27:30,127 --> 00:27:32,960
(emotional music)

639
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,473
Why?

640
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,670
- I couldn't see no way out.

641
00:27:39,623 --> 00:27:41,323
- But we was just gettin' started.

642
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,160
- My husband was one of the men
got laid off at Stone River.

643
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:48,030
And Hank's been ridin' me to death.

644
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:50,983
I couldn't take the chance
of losin' my job, too.

645
00:27:51,997 --> 00:27:54,022
- Oh, Erma, no.

646
00:27:54,022 --> 00:27:58,500
If only you just could've held
out a little while longer.

647
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,060
The union was workin' on this.

648
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,540
- Stop dreamin', Sally.

649
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:06,203
There are 500 men in that union.

650
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:11,173
What on earth did you think
they were gonna do for 25 women?

651
00:28:12,915 --> 00:28:13,748
- Oh.

652
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:27,299
Naomi, we could've talked to them.

653
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:28,910
- [Hospital Staff] Thank you, bye-bye.

654
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:29,893
- What do you mean?

655
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,007
But you're not afraid of them.

656
00:28:34,007 --> 00:28:36,000
I'm seen you.

657
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,887
- [Man] I'm here for an X-ray.

658
00:28:37,887 --> 00:28:38,770
- What?

659
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:41,400
They cut your hours in half?

660
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,783
How can they do that?

661
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:48,313
No, I understand.

662
00:28:50,951 --> 00:28:51,784
It's okay.

663
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,653
No, I'll see you at the plant.

664
00:28:56,699 --> 00:28:57,532
Okay.

665
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,730
Hi, I'm Sally, Sally Thompson.

666
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:17,023
I work over at the plant.

667
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:21,050
- Oh right, I don't have
anything to report yet.

668
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,780
- Yeah, well, I do.

669
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,203
Erma's had the operation.

670
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:26,900
- I'm sorry.

671
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,850
I wish I had known.

672
00:29:28,777 --> 00:29:31,330
- What have you done?

673
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:33,810
- Well, we're hoping to set
up a negotiating committee

674
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:35,120
by the end of the week.

675
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,280
And we're still trying to meet

676
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,380
with the president of McCade next Tuesday.

677
00:29:39,795 --> 00:29:41,320
- Hopin' and tryin'.

678
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,530
Look, I appreciate your mighty efforts.

679
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:47,020
But I do not want anyone else
to wind up on that table.

680
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:50,210
And if you just dawdle
around and let it happen,

681
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:51,940
you're gonna be wearin'
this on your conscience

682
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,073
like everybody else.

683
00:29:58,168 --> 00:30:01,001
(emotional music)

684
00:30:09,827 --> 00:30:12,030
- Somethin' the matter, mama?

685
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:12,993
- Train woke me.

686
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,880
Lasts more than 10 minutes, that's it.

687
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,187
I'm up for the rest of the night.

688
00:30:18,187 --> 00:30:19,690
- It was a long one, wasn't it.

689
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:20,523
- Yeah.

690
00:30:20,523 --> 00:30:21,973
- Must've been over 200 cars.

691
00:30:24,245 --> 00:30:25,940
- You feel like givin' me one of your hugs

692
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,073
for no good reason?

693
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:41,010
Go on back to bed.

694
00:30:52,773 --> 00:30:55,773
(people chattering)

695
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,360
- Hey, hey.

696
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,023
There's a face I haven't seen in a while.

697
00:31:00,023 --> 00:31:01,063
- Hey, Roy.

698
00:31:02,181 --> 00:31:04,460
- How're things goin' at the plant?

699
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,293
- So-so.

700
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,577
- Hank still ridin' you?

701
00:31:07,577 --> 00:31:08,640
You tell me the truth,

702
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,610
'cause I'll take care of that,

703
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:10,700
you know.
- Yeah, well.

704
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,440
You're beginnin' to look like
you never worked at McCade.

705
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,037
Your cheeks is pink, not
blue like the rest of us.

706
00:31:16,037 --> 00:31:19,130
- The doctor says I'll
be back any time now.

707
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:20,760
- Naomi'd be thrilled.

708
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,200
She don't know how you keep that packer

709
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,200
from breakin' down every five minutes.

710
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,830
She says the machine belongs in a museum

711
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,120
instead of a factory.

712
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,445
- Sounds about like me.

713
00:31:28,445 --> 00:31:30,275
I'm gonna be 40 in a month.

714
00:31:30,275 --> 00:31:31,490
- That ain't so old.

715
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:32,585
- That's plenty old

716
00:31:32,585 --> 00:31:34,963
when you ain't much to
look at in the first place.

717
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,000
So you goin' straight home?

718
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,080
- Gas station, then home.

719
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,853
- Well, how about gas station,
cup of coffee, then home?

720
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,343
- Well, got coffee already.

721
00:31:50,854 --> 00:31:54,600
- Yeah, I don't see no cinnamon
fry cakes in there, though.

722
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,030
Benny'd have a batch of 'em up by now.

723
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:57,980
- No, I gotta get home.

724
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,193
My husband's expectin' me.

725
00:32:01,338 --> 00:32:03,653
- Well, I don't mean to keep you.

726
00:32:03,653 --> 00:32:05,690
- Well, I'll best be outta here.

727
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:06,523
See you, Roy.

728
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:08,943
- See you, Sally.

729
00:32:11,598 --> 00:32:13,700
- I never thought I'd see the day,

730
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,700
a respirator that fits snug
against a woman's face.

731
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,830
About time.

732
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,030
- Girl, I hope you don't think

733
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,781
these respirators change things.

734
00:32:20,781 --> 00:32:22,477
The policy is still the same.

735
00:32:22,477 --> 00:32:25,294
- Why, if we ain't gonna be
inhalin' the pollutants as bad?

736
00:32:25,294 --> 00:32:26,127
- They're just protectin' themselves.

737
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:27,893
- Come again?

738
00:32:28,869 --> 00:32:29,730
You know, I got news for you.

739
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:30,960
Pretty soon, you ain't gonna have to worry

740
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,700
about gettin' sterilized anymore.

741
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,690
This company's startin' to feel the heat.

742
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:36,457
Unnecessary expenses like
these respirators here

743
00:32:36,457 --> 00:32:38,007
are gonna shut this place down.

744
00:32:40,433 --> 00:32:43,550
(workers chattering)

745
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,383
- Want me to help you with that?

746
00:32:44,383 --> 00:32:45,273
- No, I got it.

747
00:32:47,601 --> 00:32:49,290
- Look, I know you think
I disappointed you,

748
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:51,673
but everything's changed around here.

749
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,073
- I'm not.

750
00:32:59,707 --> 00:33:01,300
How come Marjorie and Georgia ain't come

751
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,550
to get their respirators?

752
00:33:05,661 --> 00:33:06,861
Where they been all day?

753
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:10,600
Where are Marjorie and Georgia?

754
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,713
- Why don't you check the hospital?

755
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,550
- Sally.

756
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:23,497
Wait, Sally.

757
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,830
- I don't get it.

758
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:28,940
I just, I don't get it.

759
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,220
What is goin' on?

760
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,760
- They were afraid if they
waited 'til the last minute

761
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,540
they'd be out on the
street with no place to go.

762
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,560
- Well, I'm afraid too.

763
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,400
In fact, I'm scared to death.

764
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,900
But this is my god-given right, Naomi.

765
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,250
And I am not about to
let anybody take it away.

766
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,700
Shoot, even if the union does
come up with somethin' now,

767
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,543
we ain't got a leg to stand on.

768
00:33:50,665 --> 00:33:54,010
Don't they realize that
they're just makin' it worse?

769
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:56,080
- They're not makin' it worse.

770
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,443
It's the damn company.

771
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:00,610
And furthermore, they all
got they lives, Sally.

772
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:02,333
They all got their reasons.

773
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,513
They don't need anybody to
tell 'em what's right or wrong.

774
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,200
- Somebody's got to you, haven't they?

775
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,860
You ain't the fighter that I used to know.

776
00:34:15,457 --> 00:34:16,713
- Who is anymore?

777
00:34:19,493 --> 00:34:22,966
- [Worker] That's 363.

778
00:34:22,966 --> 00:34:25,799
(engine rumbling)

779
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:36,720
- Where'd that come from?

780
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,720
- [Clark] Bought it.

781
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:41,280
- You're kidding me, what?

782
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,032
- [Clark] What you worried about?

783
00:34:43,032 --> 00:34:44,510
- You shouldn't be lettin'
him drive that thing.

784
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:46,660
He's barely 12.

785
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,253
- It's time.

786
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:50,140
- It's against the law.

787
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:52,490
- Since when did you start
payin' attention to the law?

788
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:53,440
That's enough, son.

789
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:59,450
- Now, what is that supposed to mean?

790
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:00,980
- It means you're a married woman flirtin'

791
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:03,280
with some stranger
outside the supermarket.

792
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,230
And don't say otherwise,

793
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:06,730
'cause a friend of mine from work saw you.

794
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,130
- I ain't got time for this.

795
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:29,503
Where is it, Clark?

796
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,750
Where's all the money?

797
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:33,380
- [Clark] You're lookin' at it.

798
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:36,160
- You mean to tell me that
you spend my hard-earned money

799
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,470
on a used dirt car?

800
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:38,680
- [Clark] Hey, it's my money, too.

801
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,120
- This is my rainy day money.

802
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,820
- You keep houndin' me,
you'll see another cent of it.

803
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:48,660
- Jody, come inside and pack your things.

804
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,910
- What for?

805
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:50,743
- We're leavin'.

806
00:35:50,743 --> 00:35:52,060
- You stay put.

807
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,650
- What, you got some confidence
'cause you met somebody

808
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:55,483
and you got a factory job?

809
00:35:55,483 --> 00:35:57,732
- And don't forget to
pack your school books.

810
00:35:57,732 --> 00:35:59,640
- You was plannin' on leavin'
all along, weren't you?

811
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,690
- That's right, Clark.

812
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:02,690
That's what I was plannin' all along.

813
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:05,140
I was plannin' to just
waltz out that door.

814
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,680
I was plannin' to have an operation

815
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,070
that I never wanted to have.

816
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:10,070
- What are you talkin' about, operation?

817
00:36:11,196 --> 00:36:13,846
- Oh, I'm surprised that
your friend didn't tell you.

818
00:36:15,684 --> 00:36:18,351
(door slamming)

819
00:36:20,335 --> 00:36:21,840
- Do you see this here rifle?

820
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,030
You ever try to leave
and I'll hunt you down,

821
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:25,690
and I'll kill you both.

822
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:26,523
You hear me?

823
00:36:26,523 --> 00:36:27,633
- Yes, sir.

824
00:36:27,633 --> 00:36:28,466
- Come again.
- Yes, sir.

825
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,883
- Jody, are you ready?

826
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,660
I hope you're in there packin'.

827
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:37,423
Sweetheart.

828
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,503
Jody, come on, I need you to get busy.

829
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:44,703
What are you doin'?

830
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:45,536
Come on.

831
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:46,853
- I gotta stay with pa.

832
00:36:48,312 --> 00:36:49,145
- If you're goin', go.

833
00:36:51,654 --> 00:36:53,630
- Now, you tell him to come with me.

834
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,853
I need my boy.

835
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,656
- Come on, Jody.

836
00:36:57,656 --> 00:36:58,976
Let's go take the car for another spin.

837
00:36:58,976 --> 00:37:00,596
- Jody, Jody, what is the matter?

838
00:37:00,596 --> 00:37:01,429
- Nothin'.

839
00:37:01,429 --> 00:37:02,262
I don't wanna go with you.
- Jody, talk to me.

840
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:03,296
- That's all
- Why?

841
00:37:03,296 --> 00:37:04,129
- I just don't wanna gonna.

842
00:37:04,129 --> 00:37:04,962
Now leave me alone.
- Why not?

843
00:37:04,962 --> 00:37:05,795
- Jody!

844
00:37:10,332 --> 00:37:13,165
(emotional music)

845
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:28,403
- You're gonna have to find
another way outta here.

846
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,070
- I'm gonna be at grandpa's.

847
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,550
You can change your mind
any time you want to.

848
00:37:44,784 --> 00:37:47,234
'Cause I'm gonna be waitin'
there with open arms.

849
00:38:03,384 --> 00:38:06,640
(machinery clanging)
- Let's go, let's move it.

850
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,092
(workers chattering)

851
00:38:08,092 --> 00:38:09,050
- Damn.

852
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:12,120
Be faster if I fill these
bins with a measurin' spoon.

853
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,010
- You know I put you on this here machine

854
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:15,440
'cause I thought you was experienced.

855
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,340
But you've proven me wrong
from day one, haven't you?

856
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,810
- I can't repair and fill
the bins at the same time.

857
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:21,660
It's either one or the other.

858
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,730
Take your pick.

859
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:24,833
- Sally Thompson.

860
00:38:26,867 --> 00:38:29,299
Come over here and help your friend.

861
00:38:29,299 --> 00:38:31,176
- She don't know nothin' about the packer.

862
00:38:31,176 --> 00:38:33,100
- Well, she's gonna learn, isn't she?

863
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:36,040
Now, what I want you to do
is go up this ladder here,

864
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,110
open up that door, and unclog
that stuff, let it fall down.

865
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,293
Go on.

866
00:38:40,293 --> 00:38:41,240
- I'll do it.

867
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,320
I've done it 100 times, I'll do it again.

868
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,700
- No, you gonna stay down here

869
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:47,340
and catch the blue when
it comes fallin' down.

870
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,360
Now you get up there.

871
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,810
I'll hold the ladder for you.

872
00:39:12,228 --> 00:39:14,090
- Is this thing soldered on or somethin'?

873
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:15,370
- Why don't you use some elbow grease?

874
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:16,820
You got elbows, don't you?

875
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:19,520
- Yeah, but I wasn't sure
if there was a plant policy

876
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,933
against usin' 'em or not.

877
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,907
- You know, you two girls
are real entertainin'.

878
00:39:23,907 --> 00:39:26,700
I'm gonna miss you around here.

879
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,430
- Who says we're goin' anywhere?

880
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:29,980
- Well, I haven't seen
you makin' any steps

881
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:32,040
towards gettin' yourselves fixed.

882
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,485
That's gonna mean somethin'
to those men upstairs.

883
00:39:34,485 --> 00:39:35,524
(blast booming)

884
00:39:35,524 --> 00:39:37,677
- [Worker] Hey, what is it?

885
00:39:37,677 --> 00:39:40,220
- [Worker] What happened,
how'd she get up there?

886
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,046
- You all right?

887
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,710
- Yeah.

888
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:44,660
- Now look what you done.

889
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,760
You broke my machine, didn't you?

890
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:51,690
You just get up, wash up, and get out.

891
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:52,523
You, too.

892
00:39:54,364 --> 00:39:55,830
- I swear, every day that goes by,

893
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:58,210
he gets meaner and meaner with us.

894
00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:00,770
They shipped Carolyn outta
here to scrub toilets

895
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:02,924
for less than half her pay.

896
00:40:02,924 --> 00:40:03,896
- Why?

897
00:40:03,896 --> 00:40:06,110
- They said her productivity was way off.

898
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:06,943
Of course, we all know the whole reason

899
00:40:06,943 --> 00:40:09,770
was she was holdin' out,
tryin' to set an example,

900
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:10,653
like you and me.

901
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:17,230
Now that Chris has had her
surgery, there's just us left.

902
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,670
Sally, I'm gonna say something,

903
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:26,620
and I don't think you're gonna like it.

904
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,290
First thing tomorrow morning,

905
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:30,990
I'm gonna schedule that operation.

906
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,903
- Don't do this.

907
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:39,160
- You know, I know when I'm licked.

908
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,573
My spirit's all broke.

909
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,290
I used to think Hank was
just a big bag of hot air,

910
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:47,010
and I could yell my fool head off at him

911
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:49,383
any time I wanted to, and
nothin' would ever happen.

912
00:40:49,383 --> 00:40:52,890
But now I know he is
speakin' for the company.

913
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:53,723
- Now, Naomi.

914
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:56,253
You're all I got.

915
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:00,360
I lose you, I don't
know what I'm gonna do.

916
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,083
- Don't you understand?

917
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:06,223
They have picked us off one by one.

918
00:41:08,104 --> 00:41:10,304
I'm not gonna give 'em
an excuse to fire me.

919
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,217
I can't afford it.

920
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:18,650
Sally, I'm not gonna
end up winnin' the fight

921
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:20,433
but losin' the war.

922
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,414
Don't try and stop me.

923
00:41:25,414 --> 00:41:28,247
(emotional music)

924
00:41:30,244 --> 00:41:31,732
(Naomi sobs)

925
00:41:31,732 --> 00:41:33,065
- I ain't gonna.

926
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:53,683
- At least we was both
blessed with one, right?

927
00:42:00,203 --> 00:42:01,897
Jody'll come around.

928
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:04,163
You'll see.

929
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,170
- [Doctor] Sally, I
performed a hysterectomy

930
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:19,800
on your grandmother and on
your mother for health reasons.

931
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,910
But this is a different ball of wax.

932
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:24,910
I just don't see any reason

933
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:29,910
why I should perform a tubal
ligation on a healthy woman.

934
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:33,140
There has to be another way out of this.

935
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:36,633
- I don't see one, lest you
be willin' to lie for me.

936
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:40,070
- I'm afraid that wouldn't do any good.

937
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:41,770
They'll be double-checkin' anyway.

938
00:42:43,784 --> 00:42:45,783
- Well, I'm right down to the wire here.

939
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:48,823
I only got a couple of days left.

940
00:42:50,112 --> 00:42:51,423
I can't go back to Clark.

941
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:56,193
Can't go back to 85 cents
an hour and support myself.

942
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,833
I lose this job,

943
00:43:00,176 --> 00:43:02,876
I ain't never gonna have the
means to get my son back.

944
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:08,120
Please don't make me beg for this.

945
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:11,110
- Sally, you go through with this,

946
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:14,073
you can say goodbye to
havin' children forever.

947
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,003
- Well, I'll see you on Friday.

948
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:24,223
I'll make sure not to eat breakfast.

949
00:43:27,284 --> 00:43:30,252
(staff speaking faintly)

950
00:43:30,252 --> 00:43:32,752
(baby crying)

951
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:37,120
- [Woman] Was it a boy or a girl?

952
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,113
- What?

953
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:43,833
Oh, no.

954
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:46,123
No, I didn't have a baby.

955
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,433
Where am I?

956
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:51,513
- The maternity ward.

957
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:54,543
I sorry.

958
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,203
What'd you have, female problems?

959
00:43:59,050 --> 00:43:59,883
- Of a sort.

960
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:03,993
- Probably didn't have
any other rooms available.

961
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,984
- [Staff] Here we are, special delivery.

962
00:44:08,984 --> 00:44:10,856
- [Man] Oh, here, let
me see that grand baby.

963
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:15,236
- Here you go.

964
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:16,904
- [Red-Haired Woman] Come to mama.

965
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,268
- Congratulations.

966
00:44:18,268 --> 00:44:19,616
- This is a golden moment.
- Look here,

967
00:44:19,616 --> 00:44:21,328
this is your grandpa.
- Looky there, looky there.

968
00:44:21,328 --> 00:44:22,161
- Is it a boy?

969
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:24,063
- Yes, it is.

970
00:44:27,088 --> 00:44:28,053
- Treat him nice.

971
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,833
- I will.

972
00:44:36,944 --> 00:44:39,861
(melancholy music)

973
00:45:07,133 --> 00:45:09,383
- Well, it's behind us now.

974
00:45:26,093 --> 00:45:26,926
(engines rumbling)

975
00:45:26,926 --> 00:45:28,950
You mean to tell me after what we done,

976
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:31,040
you want us to transfer from compounds

977
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,233
to another department?

978
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:34,730
- For your own good.

979
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:37,090
- There's no such thing around here.

980
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:40,210
We did what you wanted,
now isn't that enough?

981
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:43,490
- I did not go through
with this to get demoted

982
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:46,510
to sweeping floors and converters.

983
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:48,250
- Fine, you want to be harassed,

984
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:51,160
you wanted to be branded as fixed,

985
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,720
you just go ahead.

986
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,750
You stay here and you're gonna

987
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:56,180
suffer the consequences.

988
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:57,950
- Well correct me if I'm wrong,

989
00:45:57,950 --> 00:45:59,700
but I think we already have.

990
00:46:04,071 --> 00:46:09,071
(people chattering)
(equipment rumbling)

991
00:46:24,370 --> 00:46:26,847
- Just gonna take some time for all of us.

992
00:46:50,237 --> 00:46:52,320
- What are you doing in here, Miles?

993
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,153
- Visiting.

994
00:46:53,153 --> 00:46:56,630
- Yeah, well you got your
own toilet to visit, so get.

995
00:46:56,630 --> 00:46:57,540
- Well, the way I see it,

996
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:59,474
if you're gonna continue
working with the men,

997
00:46:59,474 --> 00:47:00,610
you ought to be putting
out the welcome mat

998
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:02,253
once in a while.

999
00:47:02,253 --> 00:47:03,086
- You better leave here in two seconds,

1000
00:47:03,086 --> 00:47:04,330
or I'm gonna report you.

1001
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:06,400
- Oh come on.
- Get out.

1002
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,510
- Like you're gonna get pregnant, huh?

1003
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:09,050
- Leave me alone.
- Come on.

1004
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:09,910
- Get out of here!

1005
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,653
Miles, leave me alone!

1006
00:47:15,314 --> 00:47:17,770
- Well now I thought you
said this place was private.

1007
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:21,830
We were just fooling around.

1008
00:47:22,856 --> 00:47:24,083
I'll see you later, Sally.

1009
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:26,963
- Are you okay?

1010
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,830
- You tell all the women
around you from now on

1011
00:47:33,830 --> 00:47:36,113
not to go to the bathroom alone.

1012
00:47:44,637 --> 00:47:47,027
I know that you're really Clark's lawyer,

1013
00:47:47,027 --> 00:47:48,680
and I appreciate you handling

1014
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,872
both sides of the divorce.

1015
00:47:50,872 --> 00:47:53,260
But all I want is my son back.

1016
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:56,280
- Sally, I've spoken to
him on several occasions,

1017
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,980
as early as this morning.

1018
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:00,800
Each time he's stated he
wants to live with his daddy.

1019
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:04,350
- That's because he is being forced to.

1020
00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:05,940
- Now how do you know that?

1021
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:07,400
- Because I have been the brunt

1022
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,780
of Clark's temper for a very long time,

1023
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:11,010
and now I'm not there for him

1024
00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:12,463
to take it out on anymore.

1025
00:48:13,632 --> 00:48:14,465
- That's right, you're not.

1026
00:48:14,465 --> 00:48:17,270
So don't go basing the
boys expense on your own.

1027
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:19,100
Legally, it just won't hold up.

1028
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:21,523
- Well legally, what will?

1029
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:25,570
- You're gonna have to find
another lawyer for that.

1030
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:27,520
And be prepared, that's gonna cost you.

1031
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:31,523
- Well thank you for your time.

1032
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:39,432
- Sally, are you sure you
don't want me to drive you?

1033
00:48:39,432 --> 00:48:40,580
- No, I'm gonna walk.

1034
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:42,972
- Oh, somebody's going
to the playground again.

1035
00:48:42,972 --> 00:48:45,360
- It's Jody's birthday today.

1036
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:48,170
- Oh how old is he, 11, 12?

1037
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:49,530
- 12.

1038
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:51,468
- Oh, what you doing for him?

1039
00:48:51,468 --> 00:48:53,009
- What can I do?

1040
00:48:53,009 --> 00:48:54,990
- What can you do?

1041
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:57,790
You just keep letting him
know that you're still around.

1042
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:01,897
You do your part, and
eventually he'll do his.

1043
00:49:03,409 --> 00:49:04,242
Okay?

1044
00:49:06,425 --> 00:49:07,258
Go on, go.

1045
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:14,203
- Hey hey, I'm back.

1046
00:49:15,463 --> 00:49:16,660
- Hi.

1047
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:18,670
- Doctor told me walking's
the best thing you can do

1048
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:20,920
to push them toxins
right out of your system.

1049
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:23,440
See most people, they'll go right from

1050
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,460
the plant to their car,

1051
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:27,150
and if they got an
attached garage like I do,

1052
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:29,900
they don't even have to
go outside to go inside.

1053
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:33,320
Skin don't breathe, and
that's bad, that's real bad.

1054
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:37,243
So, you mind if I let my skin
breathe with you for a ways?

1055
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:39,593
- Free sidewalk.

1056
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,200
- Well that ain't much of an invitation.

1057
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,050
- A lot happened while you were gone.

1058
00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:46,830
- Like what?

1059
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:48,870
- Come on, Roy.
- What?

1060
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:50,854
- Well there's no reason
to pull my leg about it.

1061
00:49:50,854 --> 00:49:52,113
- I don't know what you're talking about.

1062
00:49:52,113 --> 00:49:53,953
- Oh, nobody told you?

1063
00:49:53,953 --> 00:49:56,860
- I don't socialize with
anybody from McCade.

1064
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:57,693
- Yeah, well if that's true,

1065
00:49:57,693 --> 00:49:59,440
why are you wasting your time on me?

1066
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:02,630
- 'Cause you seem like a good person

1067
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:04,773
who's hurting a lot inside.

1068
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,633
- Separated now.

1069
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:10,950
My husband's got my kid.

1070
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:13,283
- I know what that's like.

1071
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:16,610
- I'm gonna get him back, though.

1072
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:19,750
- I got two kids with
their mama in Dillard.

1073
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:21,200
She don't let 'em come visit.

1074
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:24,700
I wasn't much of a husband
the first time around.

1075
00:50:27,172 --> 00:50:29,022
- Which way you going, left or right?

1076
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:33,843
- My pickup's back at
the parking lot there.

1077
00:50:44,002 --> 00:50:46,426
(knocking on door)
(gentle music)

1078
00:50:46,426 --> 00:50:51,087
- Jody!

1079
00:50:51,087 --> 00:50:55,546
Jody, you in there?

1080
00:50:55,546 --> 00:50:57,587
(knocking on door)

1081
00:50:57,587 --> 00:50:58,420
Jody?

1082
00:51:08,047 --> 00:51:08,880
Jody?

1083
00:51:22,445 --> 00:51:24,150
Didn't you hear me knocking?

1084
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:25,760
- Yeah I heard you.

1085
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,710
- Why didn't you answer me, sweetheart?

1086
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:29,643
- Didn't want to.

1087
00:51:32,805 --> 00:51:36,211
- Thought you might be out
celebrating on your birthday.

1088
00:51:36,211 --> 00:51:38,870
- Well I'm not.

1089
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:40,070
- Brought you a present.

1090
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:48,171
Ain't you gonna open it?

1091
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:49,004
- Alright.

1092
00:51:57,491 --> 00:51:59,130
- You like it?

1093
00:51:59,130 --> 00:52:01,140
- It's a catcher's mitt.

1094
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:02,143
I'm a an outfielder.

1095
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:05,428
- Well I'll exchange it for you.

1096
00:52:05,428 --> 00:52:06,261
- No, you better go.

1097
00:52:06,261 --> 00:52:07,670
Pa's gonna be home any minute.

1098
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:10,648
- Jody, now you know I want
you to come live with me.

1099
00:52:10,648 --> 00:52:12,449
- I said pa's gonna be home any minute.

1100
00:52:12,449 --> 00:52:14,420
- I don't care.

1101
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:16,987
I can't leave you here, I just can't.

1102
00:52:16,987 --> 00:52:18,408
I love you too much.

1103
00:52:18,408 --> 00:52:19,610
- Well I hate your guts,
now get out of here!

1104
00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:21,251
- Jody, you don't mean that.
- I said I hate your guts

1105
00:52:21,251 --> 00:52:23,251
and I don't want to see you no more.

1106
00:52:23,251 --> 00:52:24,918
Go, get out of here!

1107
00:52:25,811 --> 00:52:26,644
Go!

1108
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:31,128
(melancholy music)

1109
00:52:41,971 --> 00:52:46,971
(train horn sounding)
(machines whirring)

1110
00:52:56,232 --> 00:52:58,200
- What's all this hide and seek about?

1111
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,950
- Looks like McCade jumped the gun.

1112
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:02,400
Only one other plant besides us

1113
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,120
has instigated the sterilization policy.

1114
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:08,310
- But we was told that
everybody was gonna do it.

1115
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,313
- Maybe, maybe not.

1116
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,620
We're not so sure anymore.

1117
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:15,140
Anyway, I want you to hold
off from getting surgery

1118
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:16,790
'til we have a definitive answer.

1119
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:22,180
- You know, I'm real glad that you're

1120
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:24,792
keeping up on things, Dave, real glad.

1121
00:53:24,792 --> 00:53:27,459
(door shutting)

1122
00:53:36,256 --> 00:53:37,510
(gentle music)

1123
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:38,623
I think I need a push.

1124
00:53:41,595 --> 00:53:42,428
- There now.

1125
00:53:42,428 --> 00:53:44,900
Isn't that almost like a
picture perfect postcard?

1126
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:49,280
- Here I thought I knew
every decent spot around.

1127
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,673
Fort Stockton to Seguin.

1128
00:53:52,570 --> 00:53:53,403
- You hunt?

1129
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:56,573
- Can't say that I do.

1130
00:53:56,573 --> 00:53:58,130
- Well you wouldn't know this spot

1131
00:53:58,130 --> 00:53:59,610
unless you were quail hunting.

1132
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:01,220
- I see.

1133
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:02,313
You any good at it?

1134
00:54:03,536 --> 00:54:04,870
- Well, let me put it this way.

1135
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:07,573
I believe that I am one
of the primary reasons

1136
00:54:07,573 --> 00:54:09,680
that that bird has grown so plentiful

1137
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:10,883
in these here parts.

1138
00:54:12,235 --> 00:54:15,320
Aw, I just use it as a excuse

1139
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:16,573
to get away from it all.

1140
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:20,340
See the dawn crack on a beautiful sight.

1141
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,472
- Yeah.

1142
00:54:21,472 --> 00:54:23,922
I could see how nothing
could get to you up here.

1143
00:54:24,912 --> 00:54:26,050
Just let your mind glide

1144
00:54:26,050 --> 00:54:28,603
from one pleasant thought to the next.

1145
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:32,070
Except for Winter, I
would never want to leave.

1146
00:54:33,989 --> 00:54:36,196
- You want to sit?

1147
00:54:36,196 --> 00:54:37,029
- I do.

1148
00:54:38,273 --> 00:54:39,273
And I don't.

1149
00:54:42,895 --> 00:54:43,860
- Well, you just let me know

1150
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:45,750
when you feel the first snowflake,

1151
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:47,050
and I'll take you on back.

1152
00:54:58,953 --> 00:54:59,893
- If I had known it was
gonna be this peaceful,

1153
00:54:59,893 --> 00:55:02,123
I would've brought my knittin'.

1154
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,580
- What are you working on?

1155
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:06,873
- A sweater for Jody.

1156
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:11,570
You?

1157
00:55:11,570 --> 00:55:12,760
- Key chain or kindling wood,

1158
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:15,300
whatever my boy wants to do with it.

1159
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,027
- [Sally] You miss him?

1160
00:55:17,027 --> 00:55:17,963
- And my daughter.

1161
00:55:19,092 --> 00:55:20,342
- They know it?

1162
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:23,367
- They got a whole new life now.

1163
00:55:24,553 --> 00:55:26,230
It wouldn't be right
for me to go down there

1164
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:27,772
and mess 'em up.

1165
00:55:27,772 --> 00:55:28,939
- Mess 'em up?

1166
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:32,117
They gotta know that you love 'em.

1167
00:55:33,328 --> 00:55:36,923
'Cause if they don't, that'll mess 'em up.

1168
00:55:39,023 --> 00:55:41,841
- I'm not too good at that sort of thing,

1169
00:55:41,841 --> 00:55:44,710
letting people in on how I feel.

1170
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:46,823
- Well how do you know unless you try?

1171
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:51,190
- 'Cause every time I do, I ruin things.

1172
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:52,023
- For instance?

1173
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:55,273
- Like right here.

1174
00:55:58,070 --> 00:56:00,520
Ever since we come up
here, I wanted to kiss you.

1175
00:56:08,553 --> 00:56:10,180
Well, I feel like there's a blizzard

1176
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:13,330
rolling in here real quick.

1177
00:56:13,330 --> 00:56:16,420
And my hunting abilities
being what they are,

1178
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:19,950
not only will we freeze to
death, but we're gonna starve.

1179
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:23,693
So, we better just skedaddle
down off this mountain.

1180
00:56:29,692 --> 00:56:33,692
(horns wailing)
(people chattering)

1181
00:56:33,692 --> 00:56:34,713
- I feel bad.

1182
00:56:34,713 --> 00:56:36,103
I mean, I wanted to tell
him, I just couldn't.

1183
00:56:37,930 --> 00:56:39,400
- Well it don't make no difference.

1184
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:42,700
Stop making a pork pie
out of a piece of bacon.

1185
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:46,583
- Oh, just everybody knowing
a handy operation, except Roy.

1186
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:50,427
- Well, you know, if it's
meant to happen, it'll happen.

1187
00:56:50,427 --> 00:56:53,250
What're they wasting good trees on now?

1188
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:55,680
- All employees small
division to compounds

1189
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,273
meet 12 o'clock sharp
in the plank cafeteria.

1190
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:02,480
- Something tells me this
ain't gonna be no free lunch.

1191
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:07,828
- Our decision to close down
the compound division of McCade

1192
00:57:07,828 --> 00:57:10,207
is by no means a reflection

1193
00:57:10,207 --> 00:57:12,620
on the high standard of performance

1194
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:15,270
by this ambitious workforce.
(melancholy music)

1195
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:18,193
But it is a sign of the changing times.

1196
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,030
In the past months,

1197
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:24,020
increased pressure from our competitors,

1198
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:25,860
coupled with the costly demands

1199
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:28,180
for improvements by OSHA,

1200
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:31,663
have provided us with no
other option but to close.

1201
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:37,860
All other divisions of McCade
are unaffected by this,

1202
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:39,080
so however many of you

1203
00:57:39,988 --> 00:57:42,330
can be absorbed into those operations

1204
00:57:42,330 --> 00:57:45,070
will be relocated by
our staff and personnel.

1205
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:46,390
- You bastards!

1206
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:48,410
- You're not gonna get away with this.

1207
00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:49,780
- You're scum!

1208
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:51,810
You're all scum!
(yelling)

1209
00:57:51,810 --> 00:57:54,090
- Let's make no mistake about this.

1210
00:57:54,090 --> 00:57:55,240
It's because of you women

1211
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:57,090
they're closing this department down.

1212
00:57:57,933 --> 00:58:00,683
(people yelling)

1213
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:04,960
- Them sneaky bastards.

1214
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:06,597
I bet they know'd all along
this was gonna happen.

1215
00:58:06,597 --> 00:58:07,810
- You know they never cared about

1216
00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:09,650
what happened to us
women in the first place.

1217
00:58:09,650 --> 00:58:11,260
You think that since
we got our tubes tied,

1218
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:12,240
they even flinched?

1219
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,850
They ain't never had no intentions

1220
00:58:13,850 --> 00:58:15,280
of doing right by us ever.

1221
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,830
- We thought if we had the operation,

1222
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:18,170
we'd have job security.
- Erma!

1223
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:20,200
- Now we got nothing.

1224
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,690
- Erma, Erma, wait.

1225
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:24,970
- We rolled the dice, we paid the price.

1226
00:58:24,970 --> 00:58:27,900
- Don't run off like this, talk to us.

1227
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:28,923
- It's over, Sally.

1228
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:31,230
Don't you see?

1229
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:33,690
We got sterilized for nothing.

1230
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:36,520
Nothing in the world is
gonna give us back our jobs,

1231
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:40,603
and ain't nothing in the
world is gonna give me a baby.

1232
00:58:42,789 --> 00:58:45,789
(people chattering)

1233
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:52,973
- I'm sorry you had to find out like this.

1234
00:58:55,808 --> 00:59:00,468
- [Worker] Union ain't
doing it, that's for sure.

1235
00:59:00,468 --> 00:59:01,567
(dog barking)

1236
00:59:01,567 --> 00:59:03,520
- I need your help on something,

1237
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:06,049
and you are the only lawyer that I know.

1238
00:59:06,049 --> 00:59:08,923
Well you've seen the papers?

1239
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,750
- I've read all about it.

1240
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:14,133
- Yeah well, it's like this.

1241
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:17,230
I want to sue McCade Industries.

1242
00:59:17,230 --> 00:59:18,300
- Who in particular?

1243
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:20,070
- The whole damn company.

1244
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:22,210
- Sally, this is a small town.

1245
00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:23,850
Except for a couple gravel pits,

1246
00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:25,303
McCade runs the show.

1247
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:28,040
Every lawyer I know has wanted

1248
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:30,450
to take them on at one time or another,

1249
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:32,440
but we don't have the power

1250
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:33,950
nor the kind of legal staff

1251
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:37,163
that's necessary to go
against the giant corporation.

1252
00:59:38,030 --> 00:59:39,540
They know we know it.

1253
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:41,620
We know they know it.

1254
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:44,320
Why do you think they get
away with the stuff they do?

1255
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:48,440
- Well, let me know when
my divorce papers is ready.

1256
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:50,528
- Hold on, hold on a second here now.

1257
00:59:50,528 --> 00:59:52,543
Now look, I don't want you to

1258
00:59:52,543 --> 00:59:54,763
let anybody know I gave you this.

1259
00:59:58,407 --> 01:00:00,770
- ACLU, what is this?

1260
01:00:00,770 --> 01:00:03,320
- That's an organization
that deals in peoples rights.

1261
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,403
They got lawyers.

1262
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:07,630
- What's the 212?

1263
01:00:07,630 --> 01:00:09,160
- Area code for New York.

1264
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:10,810
- New York?

1265
01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:12,183
Well so you mean to sit there and tell me

1266
01:00:12,183 --> 01:00:14,430
that there ain't nobody in all of Texas

1267
01:00:14,430 --> 01:00:16,270
that'll be willing to help us.

1268
01:00:16,270 --> 01:00:18,420
- Nobody that has half
a chance of winning.

1269
01:00:19,788 --> 01:00:24,788
(cars honking)
(siren wailing)

1270
01:00:28,965 --> 01:00:32,186
(people chattering)

1271
01:00:32,186 --> 01:00:33,324
- Hey, how about you?

1272
01:00:33,324 --> 01:00:34,966
Yeah yeah.

1273
01:00:34,966 --> 01:00:36,216
- [Woman] Taxi.

1274
01:00:53,654 --> 01:00:56,571
(knocking on door)

1275
01:00:58,810 --> 01:01:00,073
- Hi, I'm Jo Mandell.

1276
01:01:01,050 --> 01:01:01,883
- Sally Thompson.
- Sally.

1277
01:01:01,883 --> 01:01:03,710
Why don't you come in and grab this seat

1278
01:01:03,710 --> 01:01:06,348
before Millie comes in
and puts more books on it.

1279
01:01:06,348 --> 01:01:07,181
- Alright.

1280
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:17,730
It's funny, nobody said that
you was gonna be a woman.

1281
01:01:17,730 --> 01:01:19,140
- Nobody told payroll, either.

1282
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:21,693
I still get my checks Joseph Mandell.

1283
01:01:23,530 --> 01:01:25,580
So, I don't mean to make you feel bad,

1284
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:28,825
but why didn't you come to us first?

1285
01:01:28,825 --> 01:01:29,658
- I didn't even know 'til

1286
01:01:29,658 --> 01:01:31,283
less than a week ago y'all existed.

1287
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:33,460
- Did you get the information

1288
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:35,087
about the fetal protection policy

1289
01:01:35,087 --> 01:01:37,680
from a memo?

1290
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,350
What I mean is did
anyone get written notice

1291
01:01:40,350 --> 01:01:42,400
that they'd be fired
if they didn't comply?

1292
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,890
A company newsletter or anything.

1293
01:01:44,890 --> 01:01:47,253
- No, I mean I never
got nothing like that.

1294
01:01:48,689 --> 01:01:49,540
- Then how did you know?

1295
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:50,473
- We was told.

1296
01:01:52,050 --> 01:01:52,883
- Who told you?

1297
01:01:54,647 --> 01:01:57,640
- It was line boss, some doctor they had.

1298
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:59,210
- Which one?

1299
01:01:59,210 --> 01:02:00,760
- What difference does it make?

1300
01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:02,870
- A lot.

1301
01:02:02,870 --> 01:02:07,050
To build a case, you need
concrete written evidence.

1302
01:02:07,050 --> 01:02:08,363
- I was sterilized.

1303
01:02:09,290 --> 01:02:10,910
Is that enough concrete evidence for you?

1304
01:02:10,910 --> 01:02:13,150
I can't have no more kids.

1305
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:16,120
- Sally, don't confuse me
with those other people.

1306
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:17,730
I'm on your side.

1307
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:21,980
But without written proof, it
is your word against theirs.

1308
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:22,813
- Why don't you just put down

1309
01:02:22,813 --> 01:02:23,940
that sandwich that you're eating

1310
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:25,340
and give me the bottom line?

1311
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:28,570
Do you or do you not think

1312
01:02:28,570 --> 01:02:30,410
that you can go up against a company

1313
01:02:30,410 --> 01:02:32,793
the side of McCade and win?

1314
01:02:33,991 --> 01:02:34,824
- I'm not going to lie to you.

1315
01:02:34,824 --> 01:02:36,550
You have been in my
office for five minutes.

1316
01:02:36,550 --> 01:02:38,350
There is no way for me to know that.

1317
01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:41,640
- Yeah, well this is a very long way

1318
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,210
for me to come to hear that.

1319
01:02:43,210 --> 01:02:45,230
I think we've just
wasted each others time.

1320
01:02:45,230 --> 01:02:47,010
- Sally, wait.

1321
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:48,830
Let me discuss this with my colleagues,

1322
01:02:48,830 --> 01:02:50,890
and I'll get back to you.

1323
01:02:50,890 --> 01:02:52,893
- Sure, I've heard that before.

1324
01:02:57,243 --> 01:03:01,503
(meat sizzling)
(birds chirping)

1325
01:03:01,503 --> 01:03:03,444
How's that chicken coming, pa?

1326
01:03:03,444 --> 01:03:05,533
- If it ain't cackling,
it must be cooking.

1327
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,380
- I know you're gonna get on with Roy.

1328
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,283
- I remember you telling me
that about somebody else once.

1329
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:16,913
- Well you been on my case all day.

1330
01:03:18,050 --> 01:03:18,883
Why?

1331
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,000
- Chicken's starting to burn.

1332
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,823
- You're blind, pa, not deaf.

1333
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:30,350
- Well you shouldn't have done it.

1334
01:03:30,350 --> 01:03:31,573
- Don't you say that.

1335
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:36,993
I wanted that job, I needed that job.

1336
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:41,803
It's just what I had to
do to keep it was wrong.

1337
01:03:49,510 --> 01:03:51,610
Roy's gonna be here any minute.

1338
01:03:51,610 --> 01:03:54,703
We all need some time off from this gloom.

1339
01:03:55,990 --> 01:03:57,903
I'll go get the potato salad, alright?

1340
01:04:00,827 --> 01:04:01,660
Hey mama.

1341
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:08,010
You gonna be having dinner with us?

1342
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:10,080
- I'll be happy to meet Roy

1343
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:12,353
just as soon as you're
officially divorced.

1344
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,383
- Well, have it your way.

1345
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:22,773
Oh my god.

1346
01:04:24,650 --> 01:04:26,460
- I was on my way home on the subway,

1347
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:28,730
I guess I missed my stop.

1348
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:31,530
- What are you doing here?

1349
01:04:31,530 --> 01:04:32,890
- I've talked to the union.

1350
01:04:32,890 --> 01:04:35,560
We've scheduled a meeting tomorrow night

1351
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:37,180
at eight o'clock for all the women

1352
01:04:37,180 --> 01:04:38,660
at Union Headquarters.

1353
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:39,560
I hope you can make it.

1354
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,950
Of course if you have
tickets to the ballet,

1355
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:43,430
well that's another story.

1356
01:04:43,430 --> 01:04:44,793
- I'll be there.
- Good.

1357
01:04:46,623 --> 01:04:48,281
- You want to stay for dinner?

1358
01:04:48,281 --> 01:04:50,643
- Let's win the case first.

1359
01:04:53,647 --> 01:04:55,580
(engine revving)

1360
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:57,650
I'm staying at the Sleep
Cheap if you need me.

1361
01:04:57,650 --> 01:04:58,483
- Alright.

1362
01:04:59,887 --> 01:05:02,720
(engine rumbling)

1363
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:05,543
Hallelujah, kiss the ground!

1364
01:05:11,270 --> 01:05:15,224
- Oh you look like a 500 watt
bulb in a 50 watt socket.

1365
01:05:15,224 --> 01:05:16,057
What was that?

1366
01:05:16,057 --> 01:05:18,330
- That was the lady from the ACLU,

1367
01:05:18,330 --> 01:05:21,960
come to find me all the
way from New York City.

1368
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:24,410
- Good for you, Sally, good for you.

1369
01:05:24,410 --> 01:05:26,360
- I can't believe it, we're on our way.

1370
01:05:27,530 --> 01:05:28,880
- In honor of the occasion.

1371
01:05:29,970 --> 01:05:32,220
One's for you and another
one's for your mom.

1372
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:35,090
They're from my yard.

1373
01:05:35,090 --> 01:05:36,880
You can keep them bottles.

1374
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,030
- They're so beautiful.

1375
01:05:39,261 --> 01:05:40,270
You know, if you hadn't said anything,

1376
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:41,890
I would've thought for sure

1377
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:43,833
they'd come from a professional florist.

1378
01:05:45,450 --> 01:05:49,990
- According to Title VII of
the Civil Rights Act of 1964,

1379
01:05:51,210 --> 01:05:56,210
discrimination on the basis
of sex is prohibited by law.

1380
01:05:57,500 --> 01:06:00,510
In my opinion, that policy was implemented

1381
01:06:00,510 --> 01:06:05,290
by McCade Industries in
blatant violation of the law.

1382
01:06:05,290 --> 01:06:07,690
For that reason and that reason alone,

1383
01:06:07,690 --> 01:06:10,442
I believe you could
win and you should win.

1384
01:06:10,442 --> 01:06:14,345
(laughing and clapping)

1385
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:17,845
Okay, but, that doesn't mean you will win.

1386
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:21,010
- [Woman] Oh great.
- [Employee] Why not?

1387
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:25,530
- Now, this is a fact that you are all

1388
01:06:25,530 --> 01:06:27,810
going to have to face if you decide

1389
01:06:27,810 --> 01:06:30,170
to enter into this lawsuit.

1390
01:06:30,170 --> 01:06:33,080
And believe me, it's gonna be a long one.

1391
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:36,390
It will test the strength of
each and every one of you.

1392
01:06:36,390 --> 01:06:40,420
The opposition will dissect
you under a microscope

1393
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:42,633
and come at you with
everything they've got.

1394
01:06:43,590 --> 01:06:44,443
Plus more.

1395
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:54,080
So, I wish that you would talk
this over with one another

1396
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:55,880
and let me know what you want to do.

1397
01:06:56,850 --> 01:06:58,823
- She's a lot of talk.

1398
01:06:59,822 --> 01:07:02,450
But I'm willing to reserve judgment.

1399
01:07:02,450 --> 01:07:04,080
- She's nothing like us.

1400
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:05,407
- Maybe that's good.

1401
01:07:05,407 --> 01:07:07,350
- You didn't like her
when you first met her.

1402
01:07:07,350 --> 01:07:09,840
- But she come down here
out of her own accord.

1403
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:12,200
How many of us would have done that, huh?

1404
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:14,790
Especially since we ain't
paying her a red cent.

1405
01:07:14,790 --> 01:07:15,623
- Y'all I don't know.

1406
01:07:15,623 --> 01:07:17,567
My husband still works at McCade.

1407
01:07:17,567 --> 01:07:19,180
I don't want to jeopardize his job,

1408
01:07:19,180 --> 01:07:20,969
word of this gets out.

1409
01:07:20,969 --> 01:07:22,080
- Well you ain't gotta
go through with this

1410
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:22,913
if you don't want to.

1411
01:07:22,913 --> 01:07:25,567
Ain't none of us gonna
hold it against you.

1412
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:29,393
We all got our reasons for
doing and not doing things.

1413
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:35,603
So, is she gonna be our
lawyer, or ain't she?

1414
01:07:49,988 --> 01:07:52,905
(knocking on door)

1415
01:07:56,449 --> 01:07:58,532
You can go ahead with it.

1416
01:07:59,510 --> 01:08:00,343
- Come on in.

1417
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:04,090
Okay let's go back.

1418
01:08:04,090 --> 01:08:06,483
When did you start in compounds?

1419
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:10,980
- It was in March.

1420
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:12,330
- That's not gonna be good enough.

1421
01:08:12,330 --> 01:08:13,603
I need the exact date.

1422
01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:16,390
- I don't know.

1423
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:19,631
- It says here March 18th.
- March 18th.

1424
01:08:19,631 --> 01:08:21,693
- Who was your supervisor?

1425
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:23,513
- Hank.

1426
01:08:24,730 --> 01:08:26,720
- Hank Smith, Hank Schwartz, Hank who?

1427
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:28,400
- Just Hank.

1428
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:31,130
I don't think any of us
ever knew his last name.

1429
01:08:31,130 --> 01:08:32,090
Who'd want to?

1430
01:08:32,090 --> 01:08:34,310
- Well, the McCade attorneys among others.

1431
01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:36,620
Now look, I know this
seems like little stuff,

1432
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:38,520
but in order to be a credible witness,

1433
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:41,240
you've got to be able to answer
these questions accurately.

1434
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:44,270
So, here's your employment record.

1435
01:08:44,270 --> 01:08:45,610
Your personal file.

1436
01:08:45,610 --> 01:08:47,640
Take them home, study them.

1437
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:50,089
Names, dates, places, conversations.

1438
01:08:50,089 --> 01:08:51,500
- Okay.
- And Sally.

1439
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:52,940
Whatever you do, don't panic.

1440
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:53,890
I grade on a curve.

1441
01:09:00,633 --> 01:09:02,803
- Really cool.

1442
01:09:03,916 --> 01:09:05,499
That last question.

1443
01:09:06,377 --> 01:09:09,260
Remind me never to vote
for Ronald Reagan again.

1444
01:09:09,260 --> 01:09:10,630
- You did fine.

1445
01:09:10,630 --> 01:09:12,350
She did fine.

1446
01:09:12,350 --> 01:09:13,770
You ready?

1447
01:09:13,770 --> 01:09:15,653
- Ready as I'll ever be, I guess.

1448
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:18,650
- This is a deposition.

1449
01:09:18,650 --> 01:09:19,900
You are not on trial here.

1450
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:22,440
If you get nervous, you
just imagine these guys

1451
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:24,573
in hula skirts and low coconuts.

1452
01:09:26,690 --> 01:09:27,800
- Miss Thompson, have you ever had

1453
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:30,920
a sexual relationship with
anyone besides your husband

1454
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:31,810
while you were still married?

1455
01:09:31,810 --> 01:09:33,930
- Objection, this is
an invasion of privacy.

1456
01:09:33,930 --> 01:09:35,120
This is highly prejudicial,

1457
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:37,870
and I am instructing the witness
not to answer the question.

1458
01:09:37,870 --> 01:09:39,620
- Have you ever used birth control?

1459
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:42,450
- Yes.

1460
01:09:42,450 --> 01:09:43,313
- For how long?

1461
01:09:45,110 --> 01:09:47,470
- From the time Jody was born.

1462
01:09:47,470 --> 01:09:50,210
June 12th, 1972,

1463
01:09:50,210 --> 01:09:54,390
until I left my husband on
April 23rd of this year.

1464
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:56,400
- May I ask the reason why?

1465
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:57,900
- Why I left my husband?

1466
01:09:57,900 --> 01:10:01,530
- No, why you used birth control.

1467
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:03,640
- 'Cause he didn't want no more kids.

1468
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:04,990
- Just your husband, Miss Thompson?

1469
01:10:04,990 --> 01:10:07,740
- Objection, the witness has
already answered the question.

1470
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:10,750
- It's true, is it not, with
or without this operation,

1471
01:10:10,750 --> 01:10:12,490
you have no current expectations

1472
01:10:12,490 --> 01:10:13,660
of having any more children,

1473
01:10:13,660 --> 01:10:15,960
given the nature of
your personal relations.

1474
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:17,780
- Objection.
- What does he mean by that?

1475
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:19,340
- We've spoken to a number of men

1476
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:21,480
at the plant, Miss Thompson.

1477
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:23,020
Now they allege that
you've been carrying on

1478
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:25,380
with at least two of your coworkers

1479
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:27,513
in the women's bathroom.
- Objection.

1480
01:10:27,513 --> 01:10:28,831
You are badgering the witness.
- At the plant,

1481
01:10:28,831 --> 01:10:30,351
and in front of the market.

1482
01:10:30,351 --> 01:10:31,540
Come on now, Miss Thomspon.
- That is a stone cold lie,

1483
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:32,570
and you know it.

1484
01:10:32,570 --> 01:10:34,709
- I have no further questions.

1485
01:10:34,709 --> 01:10:36,770
- [Lawyer] Don't volunteer any of it.

1486
01:10:36,770 --> 01:10:38,590
- So.
- I can't talk right now.

1487
01:10:38,590 --> 01:10:39,951
- What's the matter?

1488
01:10:39,951 --> 01:10:40,784
- I just gotta be alone.

1489
01:10:40,784 --> 01:10:41,780
- What happened in there?
- Nothing.

1490
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:43,460
- Well nothing sure made you awful mad.

1491
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:45,913
- What is it that you want from me, Roy?

1492
01:10:47,375 --> 01:10:49,958
(gentle music)

1493
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:56,270
- I want to spend the
rest of my life with you.

1494
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:03,493
- Why?

1495
01:11:05,930 --> 01:11:07,540
- 'Cause you got them bushy eyebrows,

1496
01:11:07,540 --> 01:11:09,640
like two little caterpillars go like that.

1497
01:11:14,490 --> 01:11:15,730
'Cause if you can stand up

1498
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:16,980
after all they've done to you,

1499
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:19,333
then maybe some of that's
gonna rub off on me.

1500
01:11:31,940 --> 01:11:33,840
- This is a picture of the lunch room.

1501
01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:36,630
If you can call it that.

1502
01:11:41,273 --> 01:11:43,720
That's my work station.

1503
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:45,375
Right there.

1504
01:11:45,375 --> 01:11:47,353
It's kind of hard to
see with all that blue.

1505
01:11:50,090 --> 01:11:51,023
Our bathroom.

1506
01:11:52,070 --> 01:11:54,080
Otherwise known as the beauty parlor,

1507
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:56,140
where we tried to make ourselves glamorous

1508
01:11:56,140 --> 01:11:57,870
at the end of the day.

1509
01:11:57,870 --> 01:12:01,440
Of course, when you only
got two sinks, no hot water.

1510
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:03,670
For all the women to use at once.

1511
01:12:03,670 --> 01:12:07,940
Ended up going home like that
wicked witch most of the time.

1512
01:12:07,940 --> 01:12:09,373
- I think I've seen enough.

1513
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:12,073
Thank you.

1514
01:12:13,732 --> 01:12:15,483
These are really gonna help a lot.

1515
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:28,863
- So here I am.

1516
01:12:30,932 --> 01:12:32,920
- I think I've found a problem.

1517
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:33,980
- Well you didn't call me over here

1518
01:12:33,980 --> 01:12:35,730
to watch you fix your car, did you?

1519
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,700
- Sorry I couldn't get over there.

1520
01:12:51,316 --> 01:12:53,733
You did not get that from me.

1521
01:13:00,769 --> 01:13:03,769
(crickets chirping)

1522
01:13:08,653 --> 01:13:11,570
(knocking on door)

1523
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:15,730
- This is a list of all
the pollutant levels

1524
01:13:15,730 --> 01:13:17,240
from everybody in compounds.

1525
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:19,010
Goes back five years.

1526
01:13:19,010 --> 01:13:20,230
Now I ain't much of reading this stuff,

1527
01:13:20,230 --> 01:13:23,810
but Roy says that all the
levels are way over the top,

1528
01:13:23,810 --> 01:13:25,160
which means if they were gonna bother

1529
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:26,820
to sterilize the women,

1530
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:28,883
they should've sterilized the men, too.

1531
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:32,253
Don't ask me how I got it.

1532
01:13:33,670 --> 01:13:35,780
- Of course I'm gonna
ask you how you got it.

1533
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:37,200
- Well I can't tell you that.

1534
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:39,130
- You asked me once if
I could win this case.

1535
01:13:39,130 --> 01:13:40,493
I can't do it alone.

1536
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:46,000
- Somebody gave it to Roy.

1537
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,010
- Somebody isn't gonna quite do the trick.

1538
01:13:48,010 --> 01:13:49,320
- He didn't tell me who.

1539
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:51,290
- Would you ask him for me?

1540
01:13:51,290 --> 01:13:52,940
Please?

1541
01:13:52,940 --> 01:13:55,470
- You know, you get to
go back to New York.

1542
01:13:55,470 --> 01:13:57,970
We still gotta live here, you know?

1543
01:13:57,970 --> 01:14:02,063
- Sally, we need a witness, desperately.

1544
01:14:03,348 --> 01:14:06,848
(gentle melancholy music)

1545
01:14:12,308 --> 01:14:17,058
- You know, you ain't gotta
tell me if you don't want to.

1546
01:14:20,191 --> 01:14:22,970
I ain't gonna hold it
against you or nothing.

1547
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:28,883
You stuck your neck
out far enough already.

1548
01:14:39,407 --> 01:14:41,990
(car whirring)

1549
01:14:43,951 --> 01:14:48,783
(gentle country music)
(bell dinging)

1550
01:14:48,783 --> 01:14:51,190
Well I asked him.
- Yeah?

1551
01:14:51,190 --> 01:14:52,690
- Didn't seem to do much good.

1552
01:14:53,768 --> 01:14:55,930
Just sort of stood there all quiet-like,

1553
01:14:55,930 --> 01:14:58,350
staring up at the blank sky.

1554
01:14:58,350 --> 01:15:01,300
Finally went to bed,
didn't even say goodnight.

1555
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:02,600
- Well, thanks for trying.

1556
01:15:04,108 --> 01:15:06,190
- Yeah, I see we made the McCade Courier.

1557
01:15:06,190 --> 01:15:07,180
Front page.

1558
01:15:07,180 --> 01:15:09,700
- Washington and New York papers, too.

1559
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:11,960
- Holy cow, they gonna run us out of town.

1560
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:13,483
- Yeah, let them try.

1561
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:15,673
- Thank you.

1562
01:15:17,449 --> 01:15:19,110
Tell me.

1563
01:15:19,110 --> 01:15:22,283
Is everybody from New
York as fearless as you?

1564
01:15:23,730 --> 01:15:25,830
- You should meet my mother.

1565
01:15:25,830 --> 01:15:29,023
She grew up dishing it out
in a rough neighborhood.

1566
01:15:30,270 --> 01:15:32,560
- She must be awful proud of you,

1567
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,280
being a lawyer and all.

1568
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:36,450
- Actually, she's still upset

1569
01:15:36,450 --> 01:15:38,473
my piano lessons didn't pay off.

1570
01:15:39,780 --> 01:15:42,563
No, she made a lot of sacrifices for me.

1571
01:15:44,150 --> 01:15:47,713
But, nothing compared to what you did.

1572
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:54,853
- You think I made a big mistake.

1573
01:15:56,350 --> 01:15:57,183
Don't you?

1574
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:02,760
- I did, at first,
before I came down here,

1575
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:06,963
but now I know you did what you had to do.

1576
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:12,913
- Well, hearing you say
that don't make it better,

1577
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:17,283
but it does take a little
bit of the sting away.

1578
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:22,503
- You want some cold toast?

1579
01:16:23,770 --> 01:16:25,190
- Well no wonder you're so tiny.

1580
01:16:25,190 --> 01:16:26,620
You never eat nothing.

1581
01:16:26,620 --> 01:16:28,057
- It's too hot out.

1582
01:16:34,704 --> 01:16:37,121
- What is Roy doing with him?

1583
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:40,210
I shouldn't even be on
the same planet with you,

1584
01:16:40,210 --> 01:16:41,630
let alone talk to you.

1585
01:16:41,630 --> 01:16:42,932
- Suits me.

1586
01:16:42,932 --> 01:16:44,530
Weren't my idea to come here, anyway.

1587
01:16:44,530 --> 01:16:46,100
Only reason I took that file is 'cause

1588
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:48,240
I just got my walking
papers yesterday myself.

1589
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:49,350
- Well you can keep on walking.

1590
01:16:49,350 --> 01:16:51,910
- Miles, we really
appreciate your contribution.

1591
01:16:51,910 --> 01:16:53,200
Don't we, Sally?

1592
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:55,071
- Yeah, we appreciate it.

1593
01:16:55,071 --> 01:16:56,612
- Yeah, I mean shoot.

1594
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:57,610
I heard talk they've been thinking about

1595
01:16:57,610 --> 01:16:58,950
phasing out that compound division

1596
01:16:58,950 --> 01:17:01,020
for the past five years anyway.

1597
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:02,370
- What?

1598
01:17:02,370 --> 01:17:05,060
You heard that and you never told us?

1599
01:17:05,060 --> 01:17:06,070
- Well none of us thought any of you

1600
01:17:06,070 --> 01:17:07,050
would go through with it.

1601
01:17:07,050 --> 01:17:08,127
We thought you'd quit first.

1602
01:17:08,127 --> 01:17:10,680
- You thought wrong.

1603
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:13,100
- They said if any of
you had a defective baby,

1604
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:15,900
you'd sue the pants off
McCade, so they had no choice.

1605
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:18,010
- No, we had no choice.

1606
01:17:18,010 --> 01:17:19,428
- Settle down, Sally.

1607
01:17:19,428 --> 01:17:20,261
- Alright.

1608
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:23,193
- Off the record,

1609
01:17:25,210 --> 01:17:28,560
nobody there wanted you
women working at the plant.

1610
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:31,313
- I'm gonna need you to say
that on the witness stand.

1611
01:17:32,249 --> 01:17:35,460
- Now you listen here and
you listen good, both of ya.

1612
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:37,290
You don't have to be employed at McCade

1613
01:17:37,290 --> 01:17:39,267
for them to mess up your life.

1614
01:17:39,267 --> 01:17:43,140
Now they rule this town,
and they rule this county.

1615
01:17:43,140 --> 01:17:45,610
You can just forget
about me being a witness.

1616
01:17:45,610 --> 01:17:47,350
- Excuse me, Jo.

1617
01:17:47,350 --> 01:17:50,350
What happened to that file that Miles took

1618
01:17:50,350 --> 01:17:51,183
from the office?

1619
01:17:51,183 --> 01:17:54,420
The one you was gonna
use as evidence in court.

1620
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:55,770
- Oh that.

1621
01:17:55,770 --> 01:17:57,370
If I remember correctly,

1622
01:17:57,370 --> 01:17:59,160
I think I sent that off to New York

1623
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:00,810
for our attorneys to review.

1624
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:02,889
- Hey that was for your
use and your use alone!

1625
01:18:02,889 --> 01:18:04,150
That weren't for no other lawyers!

1626
01:18:04,150 --> 01:18:06,163
And that weren't for no trial.

1627
01:18:10,490 --> 01:18:13,492
This is the last time
I do anybody a favor.

1628
01:18:13,492 --> 01:18:14,900
- Oh I don't know, Miles.

1629
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:16,420
I think if you search real deep,

1630
01:18:16,420 --> 01:18:18,993
you still got one more favor left in you.

1631
01:18:23,230 --> 01:18:24,523
God, I hate him.

1632
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:27,130
I hate him.

1633
01:18:27,130 --> 01:18:27,963
- Sally.

1634
01:18:29,010 --> 01:18:30,123
We got our witness.

1635
01:18:31,972 --> 01:18:33,732
(laughing)

1636
01:18:33,732 --> 01:18:35,668
- We got our witness.
- We got our witness.

1637
01:18:35,668 --> 01:18:39,529
- We got our witness.
- We got our witness.

1638
01:18:39,529 --> 01:18:43,585
(women chattering)
(laughing)

1639
01:18:43,585 --> 01:18:45,564
(upbeat dance music)

1640
01:18:45,564 --> 01:18:47,084
- Hey.

1641
01:18:47,084 --> 01:18:49,366
- I'm gonna teach you
something about Texas.

1642
01:18:49,366 --> 01:18:50,418
- What?

1643
01:18:50,418 --> 01:18:52,282
Oh no, I'm going back to New York.

1644
01:18:52,282 --> 01:18:54,247
- No you're not.
(laughing)

1645
01:18:54,247 --> 01:18:56,124
- Alright go on, get in line!

1646
01:18:56,124 --> 01:18:58,361
(all chattering)

1647
01:18:58,361 --> 01:18:59,694
Jo, get in line.

1648
01:19:00,684 --> 01:19:01,934
- What do I do?

1649
01:19:02,967 --> 01:19:05,425
- Hips, hips.
(women chattering)

1650
01:19:05,425 --> 01:19:06,925
You have it, girl.

1651
01:19:10,945 --> 01:19:13,458
- Go to the right, y'all.

1652
01:19:13,458 --> 01:19:15,804
Left.
(country music)

1653
01:19:15,804 --> 01:19:17,054
Left and right.

1654
01:19:18,961 --> 01:19:21,501
âª Arrest a man on the low âª

1655
01:19:21,501 --> 01:19:25,223
âª He said you gotta get
the rhythm of the island âª

1656
01:19:25,223 --> 01:19:28,503
(cheering and laughing)

1657
01:19:28,503 --> 01:19:30,183
âª Help me carry my load âª

1658
01:19:30,183 --> 01:19:33,265
- Okay, right!
- Left, right.

1659
01:19:33,265 --> 01:19:35,598
Left, right left right left.

1660
01:19:37,358 --> 01:19:40,858
(laughing and chattering)

1661
01:19:47,063 --> 01:19:49,460
- I thought the song was gonna go down.

1662
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:51,710
(laughing)

1663
01:19:53,681 --> 01:19:55,521
- Yeah.
- Oh yeah.

1664
01:19:55,521 --> 01:19:57,188
- What a great idea.

1665
01:20:00,444 --> 01:20:01,890
- What's the matter, Jo?

1666
01:20:01,890 --> 01:20:03,440
- This is absurd.

1667
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:05,080
- What is?

1668
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:07,330
- We gotta get a new judge on the case.

1669
01:20:07,330 --> 01:20:08,260
- Why, who'd they stick us with?

1670
01:20:08,260 --> 01:20:10,743
- Lucas Conner.
- Lucas Conner?

1671
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:12,900
When we were in grade school,

1672
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:14,620
he used to pull the wings off of flies.

1673
01:20:14,620 --> 01:20:15,980
- He's about as McCade as you can get

1674
01:20:15,980 --> 01:20:17,270
without actually punching in.

1675
01:20:17,270 --> 01:20:19,004
- Miles is gone.
- Oh my god.

1676
01:20:19,004 --> 01:20:21,185
- His phone's been disconnected.

1677
01:20:21,185 --> 01:20:22,350
I went to his house.

1678
01:20:22,350 --> 01:20:25,590
His neighbor said he split
with a bulging suitcase.

1679
01:20:25,590 --> 01:20:27,940
- Oh great.

1680
01:20:27,940 --> 01:20:29,825
Our one and only witness.

1681
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:30,950
- Probably just paid him off.

1682
01:20:30,950 --> 01:20:32,625
- Yeah, send him to Argentina.

1683
01:20:32,625 --> 01:20:34,780
- Yeah, but we're alright.

1684
01:20:34,780 --> 01:20:36,130
We're alright, ain't we Jo?

1685
01:20:37,870 --> 01:20:39,980
- It's just gonna be a little harder now.

1686
01:20:39,980 --> 01:20:42,550
I needed Miles to help clear something up.

1687
01:20:42,550 --> 01:20:44,170
- Like what?

1688
01:20:44,170 --> 01:20:46,510
- I've heard talk that
some of your ex-husbands

1689
01:20:46,510 --> 01:20:49,880
and boyfriends are going
to testify against you.

1690
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:51,160
- About what?

1691
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:54,021
- That some of you have
been sleeping around.

1692
01:20:54,021 --> 01:20:55,324
- You gotta be kidding me.
- I know.

1693
01:20:55,324 --> 01:20:56,420
- Who are they claiming?

1694
01:20:56,420 --> 01:21:00,250
- So far, Chris and you.

1695
01:21:00,250 --> 01:21:02,326
- Nobody has touched me,

1696
01:21:02,326 --> 01:21:05,423
not even my own husband since the surgery.

1697
01:21:11,089 --> 01:21:13,922
(engine rumbling)

1698
01:21:16,167 --> 01:21:18,917
(doors slamming)

1699
01:21:20,028 --> 01:21:22,180
- I got the signed
divorce papers right here.

1700
01:21:22,180 --> 01:21:24,760
That makes you a free
man and me a free woman.

1701
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:26,410
This is the man I'm gonna marry.

1702
01:21:26,410 --> 01:21:27,660
This is the man that you're claiming

1703
01:21:27,660 --> 01:21:29,290
I'm sleeping around with, but ain't,

1704
01:21:29,290 --> 01:21:31,630
because he is too much of a gentleman.

1705
01:21:31,630 --> 01:21:34,380
And Clark, if you so much as step one toe

1706
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:35,703
inside that court house,

1707
01:21:36,967 --> 01:21:38,449
I'll make your life so miserable

1708
01:21:38,449 --> 01:21:39,282
you won't know what hit you.

1709
01:21:39,282 --> 01:21:40,115
- I'll tell you what'll hit you.

1710
01:21:40,115 --> 01:21:41,363
- Listen to me good now, mister.

1711
01:21:42,350 --> 01:21:44,780
You ain't never gonna
harm this woman again.

1712
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:46,560
- You can have her.

1713
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:47,733
She's spayed, anyway.

1714
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:49,910
- Roy, don't.

1715
01:21:49,910 --> 01:21:51,190
My boy is in there.

1716
01:21:51,190 --> 01:21:53,518
- Don't you get any ideas
about getting him back.

1717
01:21:53,518 --> 01:21:55,800
- Jody, Jody!
(door slamming)

1718
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:56,633
Jody!

1719
01:21:58,242 --> 01:22:00,575
- Don't even think about it.

1720
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:03,421
(knocking on window)
(rock music)

1721
01:22:03,421 --> 01:22:04,254
- Jody!

1722
01:22:04,254 --> 01:22:05,991
Jody, I know that you can hear me darling.

1723
01:22:05,991 --> 01:22:08,580
Jody, no matter what happens,

1724
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:11,200
I ain't never gonna give up on you.

1725
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:14,260
I love you, I always will.
(tapping on window)

1726
01:22:14,260 --> 01:22:17,863
You mean more to me than
anything in this whole world.

1727
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:21,857
- Come on, Sally.

1728
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:23,913
Come on.

1729
01:22:26,980 --> 01:22:31,202
I'll take you home.

1730
01:22:31,202 --> 01:22:33,619
(rock music)

1731
01:22:37,741 --> 01:22:38,574
- That's the offer.

1732
01:22:38,574 --> 01:22:39,560
Take it or leave it.

1733
01:22:43,137 --> 01:22:44,823
- The offer?

1734
01:22:47,540 --> 01:22:49,660
It's not for me to decide.

1735
01:22:49,660 --> 01:22:51,320
- I strongly recommend
that you make it clear

1736
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:54,550
to your clients if they decide
to go further with this,

1737
01:22:54,550 --> 01:22:56,640
if they elect not to settle out of court,

1738
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:58,270
even if they win, they stand to wind up

1739
01:22:58,270 --> 01:23:00,350
with nothing in their pockets.

1740
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:02,760
- Would you like to explain that?

1741
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:04,110
- Well, if they proceed to trial,

1742
01:23:04,110 --> 01:23:06,410
and the case is decided in their favor,

1743
01:23:06,410 --> 01:23:09,870
but the judge awards
them $250,000 or less,

1744
01:23:09,870 --> 01:23:12,500
your clients are responsible
for all legal costs.

1745
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:14,930
- And trust us, there's a real possibility

1746
01:23:14,930 --> 01:23:15,973
of that in this case.

1747
01:23:15,973 --> 01:23:18,807
- This is coercion and you know it.

1748
01:23:18,807 --> 01:23:21,901
- $250,000 is a lot of
money to throw away.

1749
01:23:21,901 --> 01:23:25,920
- $250,000 divided among
all those courageous women

1750
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:28,690
is no compensation for
what they went through.

1751
01:23:28,690 --> 01:23:30,540
- It is in West Texas.

1752
01:23:30,540 --> 01:23:31,590
- How would you know?

1753
01:23:34,850 --> 01:23:38,513
More than anything, I want a victory here.

1754
01:23:39,470 --> 01:23:42,003
I want you all to have your day in court.

1755
01:23:44,010 --> 01:23:46,980
Because you put your lives on the line,

1756
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:50,000
McCade is now in the spotlight.

1757
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:54,230
Every one of you has contributed
valiantly to this end,

1758
01:23:54,230 --> 01:23:57,643
and I'm so proud.

1759
01:23:59,281 --> 01:24:00,114
(gentle music)

1760
01:24:00,114 --> 01:24:03,330
Unfortunately, the kind of victory

1761
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:04,740
we were hoping for here

1762
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:07,660
doesn't always come in a single dose.

1763
01:24:07,660 --> 01:24:12,260
Sometimes it comes in
smaller victories over time.

1764
01:24:12,260 --> 01:24:16,000
So I can't, in my heart of hearts,

1765
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,930
tell you not to accept this
less than generous offer

1766
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:22,913
because there are no guarantees.

1767
01:24:25,750 --> 01:24:30,523
If it was entirely up to
me, I'd stay and fight.

1768
01:24:32,210 --> 01:24:35,623
But I go home to my job when this is over.

1769
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:40,290
And although this money is not
enough to change your lives,

1770
01:24:40,290 --> 01:24:43,720
it will provide for you
during these tough times

1771
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:46,410
and perhaps give you comfort in knowing

1772
01:24:46,410 --> 01:24:49,013
that you have made a difference.

1773
01:24:55,566 --> 01:24:56,566
- Thank you.

1774
01:24:59,862 --> 01:25:03,268
- Much obliged.
- Don't feel bad.

1775
01:25:03,268 --> 01:25:06,984
I know you did your best.
- Thank you.

1776
01:25:06,984 --> 01:25:08,651
- Come on, let's go.

1777
01:25:10,108 --> 01:25:12,019
We need to get on with our lives.

1778
01:25:12,019 --> 01:25:14,343
- We ain't never gonna get what we want.

1779
01:25:14,343 --> 01:25:16,760
Might as well just take this.

1780
01:25:18,276 --> 01:25:20,859
(gentle music)

1781
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,500
- Well, $14,000 settlement
ain't a lot of money,

1782
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:28,513
but it might buy some peace
of mind, if that's possible.

1783
01:25:33,497 --> 01:25:35,210
You sure picked a hard
bargain caring about me

1784
01:25:35,210 --> 01:25:36,810
after all that's come down here.

1785
01:25:37,722 --> 01:25:40,670
- If I had my way, I'd
pack you and your boy up,

1786
01:25:40,670 --> 01:25:41,980
take you so far away from here,

1787
01:25:41,980 --> 01:25:43,587
your shadow couldn't find you.

1788
01:25:48,237 --> 01:25:50,740
You ain't done with
this thing yet, are you?

1789
01:25:50,740 --> 01:25:53,090
- To tell you the truth,
I honestly don't know.

1790
01:25:55,042 --> 01:25:57,510
But I got this anger inside,

1791
01:25:57,510 --> 01:25:59,610
and I just don't know what to do about it.

1792
01:26:01,210 --> 01:26:02,550
I gotta let it out.

1793
01:26:02,550 --> 01:26:04,020
But I pray when it happens,

1794
01:26:04,020 --> 01:26:05,293
it ain't let out on you.

1795
01:26:06,583 --> 01:26:07,613
- Don't you worry about it.

1796
01:26:08,923 --> 01:26:11,013
If you've got to dish out, I can take it.

1797
01:26:13,850 --> 01:26:15,603
- I love you, Roy Wheeler.

1798
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:23,140
You sure must be eager to get home.

1799
01:26:23,140 --> 01:26:25,150
- Hm, I've been away so long.

1800
01:26:25,150 --> 01:26:27,210
I hope my husband recognizes me.

1801
01:26:27,210 --> 01:26:29,010
I'll be like, hi honey, it's me, Jo.

1802
01:26:30,970 --> 01:26:33,480
- I want you to have this.
(gentle music)

1803
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:36,743
It's just a small token of appreciation.

1804
01:26:38,590 --> 01:26:40,443
It's a baby quilt.

1805
01:26:41,970 --> 01:26:45,990
I made it for Jody when he was born.

1806
01:26:45,990 --> 01:26:47,950
- I can't keep this.

1807
01:26:47,950 --> 01:26:50,923
- Oh no, it's just a quilt.

1808
01:26:52,590 --> 01:26:56,963
Nothing compared to what
you gave to us, to me.

1809
01:26:58,781 --> 01:26:59,780
If it hadn't have been for you,

1810
01:26:59,780 --> 01:27:02,383
we wouldn't have had a voice.

1811
01:27:03,540 --> 01:27:04,893
I would've just given up.

1812
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:08,320
Pretty soon we've been forgotten about.

1813
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:10,530
I wouldn't have had the
strength to fight 'em alone.

1814
01:27:10,530 --> 01:27:11,923
- Oh yes you would.

1815
01:27:13,650 --> 01:27:18,373
You are a much more fearless
woman than you think you are.

1816
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:22,373
- Well.

1817
01:27:25,623 --> 01:27:28,450
We sure started something here, didn't we?

1818
01:27:28,450 --> 01:27:29,343
- Yeah we did.

1819
01:27:30,710 --> 01:27:31,580
- You better get going.

1820
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:33,990
You know that meter's running.

1821
01:27:52,219 --> 01:27:53,052
Bye.

1822
01:27:55,460 --> 01:27:59,197
My name is Sally Wheeler.
(gentle music)

1823
01:27:59,197 --> 01:28:02,136
I am writing you on behalf
of a serious injustice

1824
01:28:02,136 --> 01:28:07,110
that has forever changed the
lives of my ex-coworkers,

1825
01:28:07,110 --> 01:28:10,023
my dear friends, and myself.

1826
01:28:12,070 --> 01:28:15,280
On March 30th, 1984,

1827
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:17,590
the women working in
the compounds division

1828
01:28:17,590 --> 01:28:20,653
of McCade Industries, Grift Texas,

1829
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:25,200
were forced to undergo a
sterilization procedure

1830
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:26,833
to keep their jobs.

1831
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:31,400
It is now nearly seven years later,

1832
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:32,943
and little has changed.

1833
01:28:33,940 --> 01:28:36,210
There is still no law on the books

1834
01:28:36,210 --> 01:28:39,423
forbidding this heinous
crime against humanity.

1835
01:28:40,620 --> 01:28:44,000
How many more women will
have to live in fear each day

1836
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,653
that their birthrights
might be taken away?

1837
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:52,020
How many more women will have
to suffer the consequences

1838
01:28:52,020 --> 01:28:54,373
until total justice is done?

1839
01:28:55,821 --> 01:28:57,453
I know it's too late for us,

1840
01:28:59,220 --> 01:29:01,640
but it's not too late to close the book

1841
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:03,763
on this terrible mistake.

1842
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:11,300
Please, put an end to
fetal protection policies.

1843
01:29:13,870 --> 01:29:16,913
With all respect, Sally Wheeler.

1844
01:29:19,900 --> 01:29:20,733
Thank you.

1845
01:29:23,890 --> 01:29:26,713
Anyway, nothing more to tell, Jody.

1846
01:29:28,060 --> 01:29:29,740
It's funny, I promised myself

1847
01:29:29,740 --> 01:29:31,310
if we ever got back together,

1848
01:29:31,310 --> 01:29:33,463
I wouldn't go on about the past.

1849
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:37,143
So much for promises.

1850
01:29:57,880 --> 01:29:58,730
- I let you down.

1851
01:30:01,030 --> 01:30:03,661
I wasn't there for you when you needed me.

1852
01:30:03,661 --> 01:30:05,750
- Don't you think that way.

1853
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:06,623
I got through it.

1854
01:30:07,983 --> 01:30:09,473
I wasn't alone, I had Roy.

1855
01:30:11,210 --> 01:30:12,403
- Well you had me too.

1856
01:30:16,350 --> 01:30:17,903
I wanted to go with you, mama.

1857
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:21,793
I really did.

1858
01:30:24,170 --> 01:30:26,403
But he was gonna kill you if I ever tried.

1859
01:30:28,210 --> 01:30:29,923
Kill me too if I ever told you.

1860
01:30:32,714 --> 01:30:33,547
- No.

1861
01:30:36,538 --> 01:30:39,418
You lived all this time with that?

1862
01:30:39,418 --> 01:30:41,263
(gentle music)

1863
01:30:41,263 --> 01:30:43,263
Here I thought I went through something.

1864
01:30:48,940 --> 01:30:50,690
How can I take your hurt away, huh?

1865
01:30:55,194 --> 01:30:57,027
- Just be my mama now.

1866
01:31:14,276 --> 01:31:16,752
(phone ringing)

1867
01:31:16,752 --> 01:31:18,872
- [Nurse] Dr. Seebers to radiology please.

1868
01:31:18,872 --> 01:31:21,733
- Hurry up Roy.
- I'm right behind you.

1869
01:31:21,733 --> 01:31:22,853
- Good evening.

1870
01:31:22,853 --> 01:31:25,183
- She's so beautiful.

1871
01:31:27,056 --> 01:31:28,402
- Hi.

1872
01:31:28,402 --> 01:31:29,997
Hey Sally, hey Roy.
- Oh hi.

1873
01:31:33,106 --> 01:31:36,005
- Here she is.
- Come here, come here.

1874
01:31:36,005 --> 01:31:36,838
Hi.

1875
01:31:37,725 --> 01:31:41,073
Mama, your granddaughter
wants to meet you.

1876
01:31:43,986 --> 01:31:48,986
(gentle music)
(baby weeping)

1877
01:31:51,467 --> 01:31:52,384
Thanks Roy.

1878
01:31:56,215 --> 01:31:57,465
We're so lucky.

1879
01:32:00,049 --> 01:32:03,216
- [Roy] Guess that makes me a grandpa.

1880
01:32:04,050 --> 01:32:06,633
(gentle music)

1881
01:32:36,684 --> 01:32:40,351
(steady instrumental music)

1882
01:35:35,583 --> 01:35:38,416
