[traffic]

4
00:02:09,664 --> 00:02:14,186
Hey, how you doing beautiful?
[laughs]

5
00:02:14,638 --> 00:02:20,240
[laughs] Oh damn!
Ohh! Turned down by a flamer.

6
00:02:21,423 --> 00:02:22,467
Man! Fuck this!

7
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,902
[screeching tires]

8
00:02:27,476 --> 00:02:28,938
What are you doing?

9
00:02:29,355 --> 00:02:32,452
What are you going to say while
playing "Hide the Salami"?
[laughs]

10
00:02:32,591 --> 00:02:34,852
[inaudible]
[screeching tires]

11
00:02:35,757 --> 00:02:36,975
Shit!

12
00:02:38,506 --> 00:02:41,115
Be careful...

13
00:02:41,185 --> 00:02:45,464
His purse could be used
as a deadly weapon. [laughing]

14
00:02:45,534 --> 00:02:48,317
[kissing sounds]
[laughing] Oh shit.

15
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:54,127
-[deep breath]
-Then what Stevie?

16
00:02:54,823 --> 00:02:56,875
You aren't going to
wet yourself, are you?

17
00:02:57,362 --> 00:02:58,928
[Mark laughs]

18
00:02:59,067 --> 00:03:00,251

[siren]

22
00:03:50,977 --> 00:03:53,238
Hey! Who's that? His lawyer?

23
00:03:53,308 --> 00:03:54,630
His wife.

24
00:03:56,996 --> 00:03:59,188
I've reached my decision.

25
00:04:00,197 --> 00:04:04,128
[judge] Although only one of the
young men actually took part
in the assault,

26
00:04:04,546 --> 00:04:07,155
I hold both responsible.

27
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,722
However, taking into
consideration that there
are no previous convictions,

28
00:04:13,452 --> 00:04:15,958
I'm not going to give either
of you a prison sentence.

29
00:04:16,688 --> 00:04:20,585
Steven Mendoza,
200 hours of community service.

30
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:25,143
Mark Gonzalez,
100 hours of community service.

31
00:04:26,047 --> 00:04:29,561
In an AIDS facility!
[bangs gavel]

32
00:04:36,658 --> 00:04:38,189
[sighs]

33
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:51,375

[music fades]

36
00:05:54,974 --> 00:05:56,018
[sighs]

37
00:06:04,508 --> 00:06:08,196
[deep breath] Hey how you doing?
I'm here for the um...

38
00:06:09,657 --> 00:06:13,275
Um, I'm supposed to meet
a Mrs. Bernard or something.

39
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:16,580
-I don't know, I'm supposed to
help out or something.
-I'm Dr. Bernard.

40
00:06:18,668 --> 00:06:19,990
You must be Stevie?

41
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:25,383
Alright, before we get things
started I think there's a few
things you need to know.

42
00:06:25,904 --> 00:06:30,289
Firstly, we don't wear uniforms
because we are trying
to give the impression

43
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,376
of a home, not a hospital.

44
00:06:33,072 --> 00:06:36,447
Also, we have
a very specialized clientele.

45
00:06:36,724 --> 00:06:38,603
In order to be admitted
into this hospice,

46
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,630
a doctor has to determine
that a patient has...

47
00:06:42,048 --> 00:06:43,753
six months or less to live.

48
00:06:44,414 --> 00:06:48,380
So if a patient lives longer
than six months do you take him
out back and shoot him?

49
00:06:51,894 --> 00:06:58,748
I'd appreciate it greatly
if you would supervise Stevie
during his short stay with us.

50
00:06:59,965 --> 00:07:03,132
If it proves difficult,
all the staff
can pitch in and help.

51
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:05,985
Alright... thank you.

52
00:07:11,273 --> 00:07:16,631
Well? What, if anything,
are you capable of doing
to help out or something?

53
00:07:17,432 --> 00:07:22,476
I don't know? Um...
maybe clean both
your broomsticks?

54
00:07:23,937 --> 00:07:25,990
If I had a guess
at your qualifications,

55
00:07:26,059 --> 00:07:28,529
I'd say that there are
a couple of things you can do.

56
00:07:30,444 --> 00:07:32,844
-OK.
-Bathrooms or bedpan?

57
00:07:32,914 --> 00:07:36,358
[laughs] Yeah.
How about door number three?

58
00:07:36,462 --> 00:07:38,620
-There isn't one Stevie.
-Well I'll make one. Look,

59
00:07:38,654 --> 00:07:41,785
I'll refuse this shit
and have the judge
give me jail time instead.

60
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:51,632
OK, look. I think we got off
to a bad start.

61
00:07:52,049 --> 00:07:53,232
Hi, I'm Stevie.

62
00:07:55,354 --> 00:07:57,442
-I know that.
-And you are...

63
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,529
Supervising your community time.

64
00:08:02,035 --> 00:08:03,670
OK Ma'am,

65
00:08:03,704 --> 00:08:07,809
isn't there anything else
I can do for the next 30 days
besides cleaning toilets?

66
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:14,872
[floor creaks]

67
00:08:15,672 --> 00:08:16,960
[knocks]

68
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:23,223
[coughs]
Um, to what do I owe this visit?

69
00:08:23,571 --> 00:08:25,170
Uh, I was just stopping by...

70
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,258
the hospital.

71
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,076
Oh, where are my manners?

72
00:08:31,294 --> 00:08:33,173
Please, have a seat.

73
00:08:48,238 --> 00:08:51,404
-So, do you go to school?
-No.

74
00:08:52,482 --> 00:08:53,665
Work then?

75
00:08:55,683 --> 00:08:57,318
Ah, aren't we lucky.

76
00:08:58,223 --> 00:08:59,301
All that can wait.

77
00:08:59,301 --> 00:09:02,781
The important thing is to enjoy
yourself while you're young.

78
00:09:02,781 --> 00:09:03,929
See the world.

79
00:09:05,217 --> 00:09:06,608
Have you seen the world?

80
00:09:08,034 --> 00:09:13,114
Actually... outside of the US
I've only been to Australia.

81
00:09:13,914 --> 00:09:16,280
Some world-traveler, huh?
[frightened gasp]

82
00:09:16,384 --> 00:09:17,463
[sighs]

83
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:20,907
-I didn't mean to startle you.
-No you didn't, it's just...

84
00:09:21,534 --> 00:09:23,239
I only had time
to come in for a minute.

85
00:09:24,978 --> 00:09:26,056
I got to go.

86
00:09:29,501 --> 00:09:32,214
[piano music]

87
00:09:33,188 --> 00:09:34,302
[sighs]

88
00:09:41,608 --> 00:09:45,366
You know what I heard...
yeah, exactly.

89
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,975
[footsteps]
I gotta go.

90
00:09:51,106 --> 00:09:52,533
Sorry, I don't think it...

91
00:09:52,568 --> 00:09:56,256
[sighs] ...went too well.

92
00:09:57,195 --> 00:10:02,413
[footsteps]

93
00:10:04,154 --> 00:10:06,380
[sighs] Is Carlos OK?

94
00:10:08,329 --> 00:10:10,763
I think we've gotten off
to a bad start.

95
00:10:11,668 --> 00:10:12,956
My name is Sonya.

96
00:10:13,339 --> 00:10:17,200
You don't have to clean bedpans
and I think it would be best

97
00:10:17,235 --> 00:10:19,601
if you didn't visit
another patient.

98
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:22,906
What else can you do?

99
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:27,499
Well, I can clean up.
You know mop,
sweep, do the dishes.

100
00:10:27,882 --> 00:10:29,447
That was pretty much
my last job.

101
00:10:30,977 --> 00:10:33,449
And I think I can handle
just about any
maintenance thing.

102
00:10:33,483 --> 00:10:36,614
You know, loose wiring,
patching up holes in the wall.
Stuff like that.

103
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:40,024
Just about anything
but painting.
I hate painting!

104
00:10:49,069 --> 00:10:51,748
Should have told her
I hated getting laid!

105
00:10:52,966 --> 00:10:54,879
[Will shouts]
Close my fucking door.

106
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:02,882
You trying to kill me
with those God-damn fumes?

107
00:11:04,065 --> 00:11:07,892
-Sorry.
-Sorry? What are you?
Some kind of faggot?

108
00:11:08,309 --> 00:11:09,457
[Stevie] Nope.

109
00:11:17,633 --> 00:11:19,164
So what are you then?

110
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,853
Why are you painting walls
that don't need to be painted?

111
00:11:32,698 --> 00:11:34,786
Are you dumb or just stupid?

112
00:11:37,082 --> 00:11:40,422
Well this certainly
narrows it down.
You're obviously not a painter!

113
00:11:42,336 --> 00:11:44,110
And you're not a talker.

114
00:11:44,493 --> 00:11:46,371
And you say you're not a faggot.

115
00:11:47,311 --> 00:11:49,260
So, what the hell are you then?

116
00:11:49,364 --> 00:11:52,321
Are you good for anything
besides using up
the air on this planet?

117
00:11:52,668 --> 00:11:56,775
I say, keep chopping down
the rainforest, we don't need
the air the trees provide.

118
00:11:57,227 --> 00:11:59,141
We just need to kill off
the dead wood,

119
00:11:59,175 --> 00:12:01,819
the people that are
a waste of space on this planet.

120
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:07,142
And we can start with you,
what do you think?
[laughs sarcastically]

121
00:12:07,699 --> 00:12:10,204
[laughing]
Didn't mean to offend you boy.

122
00:12:10,518 --> 00:12:13,335
In desperate times
such as these,

123
00:12:13,335 --> 00:12:16,466
a fella's got to do
what he's got to do
to keep himself amused.

124
00:12:18,206 --> 00:12:20,815
Yo? Yo Betty Boop?

125
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:27,461
Sorry...
Miss Boop, I was wondering
if I could borrow...

126
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:30,418
- What's your name boy?
- Stevie.

127
00:12:32,332 --> 00:12:35,254
Can I borrow Stevie here?

128
00:12:35,846 --> 00:12:39,673
Staring at the walls
of Cell Block 1-0-7 has made me
a little stir-crazy,

129
00:12:39,707 --> 00:12:41,378
in case you couldn't tell,

130
00:12:41,378 --> 00:12:45,413
and if I don't talk
to someone fairly quickly,
I'll surely pop.

131
00:12:46,005 --> 00:12:47,292
So what do you say?

132
00:12:47,396 --> 00:12:51,885
Can Stevie here
be the beneficiary
of hearing my life story?

133
00:12:52,997 --> 00:12:58,008
-But what about the painting?
-I'm not talking all day Boopsy.

134
00:12:58,147 --> 00:13:02,322
I could limit my life story
to the time I've spent
in this exciting establishment,

135
00:13:02,322 --> 00:13:04,897
and then all I'd need
is three seconds.

136
00:13:05,975 --> 00:13:07,645
I'll give you 15 minutes.

137
00:13:08,063 --> 00:13:11,090
Your Highness is both
generous and compassionate.

138
00:13:11,751 --> 00:13:14,916
Thou has put aside the rumors
that though hast no heart.

139
00:13:15,334 --> 00:13:18,534
Come my Lordship,
time is of the essence.

140
00:13:27,372 --> 00:13:29,843
[orchestral music]

141
00:13:31,025 --> 00:13:32,277
[sighs]

142
00:13:36,314 --> 00:13:38,471
[orchestral music continues]

143
00:13:40,245 --> 00:13:42,019
Well, Stevie...

144
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:47,795
I said I'd be telling you
my life story but,
I've already heard it.

145
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:49,952
So, how about you tell me yours.

146
00:13:50,021 --> 00:13:52,527
Actually,
I think I've heard yours too.

147
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:55,344
Grew up in a modest house
with your parents.

148
00:13:55,484 --> 00:13:59,068
They fought some
but mostly got along
pretty darn good.

149
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,572
They tried to keep you
down on the ranch,

150
00:14:01,572 --> 00:14:04,599
but you managed to sew
your wild oats anyway,

151
00:14:04,634 --> 00:14:07,939
and that pretty much
takes up all your thoughts.

152
00:14:08,043 --> 00:14:09,992
How you gonna sow more oats?

153
00:14:09,992 --> 00:14:14,271
Well, now that we've finished
that story what else
can we talk about?

154
00:14:14,793 --> 00:14:17,541
How about politics?
What do you think about Bosnia?

155
00:14:19,142 --> 00:14:20,882
Affirmative action?

156
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:23,804
Nuclear weapons?

157
00:14:24,014 --> 00:14:25,057
[sighs]

158
00:14:25,683 --> 00:14:29,754
If your tongue's been cut out,
I could get a chalkboard
and some chalk.

159
00:14:29,788 --> 00:14:31,876
Uh, well who says
you know how to write?

160
00:14:32,259 --> 00:14:34,590
A snappy comeback.

161
00:14:34,868 --> 00:14:41,131
Almost a witticism. I'm stunned.
I'm impressed. I see you
in a completely different light.

162
00:14:41,235 --> 00:14:46,141
So, does this off-the-cuff
remark try to conceal the fact
that you have no opinion?

163
00:14:46,628 --> 00:14:50,212
Or is it your opinion that we
should all be opinionless?

164
00:14:50,941 --> 00:14:52,091
What is that?

165
00:14:53,482 --> 00:14:56,022
A toy. That's what I do.

166
00:14:56,543 --> 00:15:00,858
At least that's what I did.
Now, it's just a hobby.

167
00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:06,285
That's what happens when you
continue to do things
that no longer make any money.

168
00:15:07,016 --> 00:15:10,390
The career becomes a hobby.

169
00:15:12,896 --> 00:15:16,375
So, with all that nuclear
testing going on in Nevada,

170
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:19,297
I've always been amazed that
anyone would want to live there.

171
00:15:19,749 --> 00:15:21,594
Not that California's so great.

172
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:25,385
There's probably a nuclear sub,
from who knows what country,

173
00:15:25,421 --> 00:15:27,857
passing by our great city
as we speak.

174
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:32,414
It could be from one of those
new Russian countries,
one of the ones like...

175
00:15:32,797 --> 00:15:36,902
never could spell,
can't pronounce and have
no idea who the leader is.

176
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,511
But thank God
there's no nuclear threat!

177
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:43,060
And you know what happens
when the wind blows west?

178
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:45,773
Radiation is carried
all over California.

179
00:15:45,913 --> 00:15:49,810
And when I realized this,
did I pack my bags
and get the hell out?

180
00:15:50,471 --> 00:15:56,421
No. Actually... I think I went
to the deli and ordered
a pastrami sandwich.

181
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:01,395
Uh, anyway...
What kind of toy
is that going to be?

182
00:16:03,761 --> 00:16:07,519
I'm trying to make a unicorn.
Hopefully one that will fly.

183
00:16:09,084 --> 00:16:10,719
My father taught me
how to make toys

184
00:16:10,823 --> 00:16:14,233
and I'm something of a prodigy,
if I do say so myself.

185
00:16:14,581 --> 00:16:17,747
But there's always been
one thing that I could
never make...

186
00:16:18,025 --> 00:16:19,766
a toy that would fly.

187
00:16:20,391 --> 00:16:23,767
Even my paper aeroplanes
nose-dived straight
into the ground.

188
00:16:24,428 --> 00:16:27,837
So before I leave this cruel,
gravitational world,

189
00:16:27,872 --> 00:16:30,586
I'm going to make
something that will fly...

190
00:16:30,655 --> 00:16:33,335
Hello William!

191
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,231
-I brought you a care package.
-[Will] Oh!

192
00:16:37,266 --> 00:16:41,893
I'm sick of hearing him
whine, whine, whine
about the food here.

193
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:47,286
Am I interrupting something?

194
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,565
Well, I think our time
has expired for today.

195
00:16:51,808 --> 00:16:53,687
If you keep
Herr Kommandant waiting,

196
00:16:53,687 --> 00:16:56,262
you may not be able to come
and visit again tomorrow.

197
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:12,787
[soulful music]

198
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:38,430
[sighs]
[bottle breaks]

199
00:17:38,534 --> 00:17:41,074
[laughs]
[soulful music continues]

200
00:17:42,569 --> 00:17:43,613
[bottle breaks]

201
00:17:45,318 --> 00:17:47,545
Hey, so um, how did it go today?

202
00:17:47,684 --> 00:17:48,763
[sighs]

203
00:17:50,154 --> 00:17:51,963
Alright, I guess.

204
00:17:53,564 --> 00:17:57,322
You know, you got a car
and they gave you
the closest hospital.

205
00:17:57,983 --> 00:18:01,949
Man, it takes me three buses
to get to my
fudge packers' clinic.

206
00:18:02,575 --> 00:18:03,932
Nah.

207
00:18:05,219 --> 00:18:07,863
Once I got there
it wasn't so bad though.

208
00:18:08,942 --> 00:18:12,387
They all seemed kind of scared
of me so they didn't
boss me around so much.

209
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:14,509
What about you?

210
00:18:16,283 --> 00:18:17,918
[sighs] I don't know.

211
00:18:18,684 --> 00:18:22,442
I mean when I showed up,
the first thing I saw
was this fine-ass freak.

212
00:18:22,442 --> 00:18:25,120
-You know what I'm saying?
-Hmm-mmm. [laughs]

213
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:27,973
And I thought
this prison sentence is
turning out to be pretty cool.

214
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:29,156
Yeah.

215
00:18:29,156 --> 00:18:31,174
Then she opened her mouth
and ruined everything.

216
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,131
Man, I hate it
when girls do that shit.

217
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:38,271
You know, I was thinking
about digging a tunnel...
try to escape...

218
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:43,385
-but then I met this dude...
-And he asked if you wanted
to be the mommy or the daddy?

219
00:18:44,116 --> 00:18:46,517
And you said
you wanted to be the daddy...

220
00:18:46,621 --> 00:18:51,318
so he said "OK, get down
on your knees
and suck momma's dick."

221
00:18:51,945 --> 00:18:54,241
[laughs]

222
00:18:55,598 --> 00:19:00,678
Man, this guy's a trip.
I mean, I don't understand
half the shit he says...

223
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,495
You know, it's kinda like...

224
00:19:03,495 --> 00:19:06,592
Remember when I had to go to
traffic school
and I got into that school

225
00:19:06,626 --> 00:19:09,897
-that hired comedians
for teachers?
-Oh yeah!

226
00:19:10,245 --> 00:19:13,724
They hired teachers
from our high school, right?
[laughs]

227
00:19:14,489 --> 00:19:17,342
Anyway, the guy's a trip.

228
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:31,920
[soulful music]

229
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:37,974
You know if you keep enjoying
your work I'll have to give
you another assignment?

230
00:19:38,322 --> 00:19:42,428
Don't worry I'm still hating it.
I just figured I might as well
try and get it done.

231
00:19:43,402 --> 00:19:46,150
And give yourself
a little bit more time
to talk to Will?

232
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:50,221
-Yeah, I guess so.
If you don't mind?
-It's fine by me.

233
00:19:51,091 --> 00:19:52,726
[sweeping]

234
00:20:00,937 --> 00:20:02,015
We've caught one.

235
00:20:10,399 --> 00:20:13,358
[somber music]

236
00:20:23,169 --> 00:20:27,483
[plastic sheeting]

237
00:20:45,504 --> 00:20:47,453
[plastic sheeting continues]

238
00:20:51,802 --> 00:20:57,091
[zipper]
[somber music continues]

239
00:21:12,121 --> 00:21:15,635
[Will] Have you ever considered
what you'd like done
with your body after you die?

240
00:21:19,671 --> 00:21:25,202
[sighs] I'd like to be buried,
but I don't want a coffin.

241
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:31,431
A coffin is a waste of money
and a waste of a perfectly good
tree that is supposed to grow,

242
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:36,301
produce air, make treelings.
Not be chopped down,
nailed together

243
00:21:36,335 --> 00:21:37,936
and stuck into the ground...

244
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:41,033
Just bury me as I came
into this world.

245
00:21:41,172 --> 00:21:43,294
Hmm, in my birthday suit.

246
00:21:47,852 --> 00:21:51,192
I've always like the idea
of being buried in my own land.

247
00:21:52,861 --> 00:21:56,271
But, since the only land I own
is in this pot here...

248
00:21:57,072 --> 00:21:58,881
I'd settle for being
buried in a park,

249
00:21:58,881 --> 00:22:00,829
but not in some stuffy cemetery

250
00:22:00,829 --> 00:22:04,204
surrounded by strangers who,
if I knew in life,
I probably wouldn't like.

251
00:22:04,621 --> 00:22:06,257
You know,
I hate to tell you this Will,

252
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:09,944
but I think it's totally illegal
to be buried in a park.

253
00:22:10,815 --> 00:22:15,407
There you go again
bringing realism into it.

254
00:22:18,225 --> 00:22:21,356
The whole idea of a coffin
has always baffled me.

255
00:22:21,982 --> 00:22:25,531
I think of it
as man's final attempt
to overcome nature,

256
00:22:25,566 --> 00:22:29,567
be buried in a box
so that yucky dirt
doesn't get all over you.

257
00:22:30,436 --> 00:22:33,290
I think I'd rather be eaten
by the bugs right away,

258
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:37,430
than have it prolonged
a few years while my coffin
starts to fall apart...

259
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,343
Do you think we can talk
about something else?

260
00:22:39,413 --> 00:22:42,336
A little too morose
for such a sunny day?

261
00:22:43,658 --> 00:22:47,624
Who the hell am I to take up
a six-foot plot of land
for the rest of eternity?

262
00:22:48,807 --> 00:22:51,799
That would make me
more important in death
than I ever was in life.

263
00:22:52,042 --> 00:22:55,139
And no-one ever goes
to cemeteries anyway.

264
00:22:55,313 --> 00:22:59,488
Maybe my parents would visit
a few times, possibly a friend
or two might drop by,

265
00:22:59,523 --> 00:23:01,436
but after they died
who would ever show up?

266
00:23:01,819 --> 00:23:02,863
Nobody!

267
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:07,316
I say bury me then plant
some trees over me or...

268
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:10,239
build an ice-cream stand
on top of me for all I care.

269
00:23:10,377 --> 00:23:11,909
[digging in pot plant]

270
00:23:11,909 --> 00:23:15,249
You know Will,
to me you seem like you're
in great health.

271
00:23:15,806 --> 00:23:20,085
Ha my boy, for that you can
help yourself to another soda.

272
00:23:23,773 --> 00:23:25,095
[appreciative sigh]

273
00:23:26,382 --> 00:23:31,044
-Hey, you want one?
-Ah, no... I have to
watch my figure.

274
00:23:31,252 --> 00:23:32,470
[fridge closes]

275
00:23:37,515 --> 00:23:38,559
[sighs]

276
00:23:40,612 --> 00:23:44,021
[opens can]
[Will] Care for some
disinfectant?

277
00:24:00,896 --> 00:24:03,122
Have you ever noticed
how people act when they drive?

278
00:24:03,783 --> 00:24:07,958
The wimpiest guys
get in their cars and suddenly
turn into Super Cock!

279
00:24:08,098 --> 00:24:12,168
The tattooed rebel...
itching for a good fight.

280
00:24:12,342 --> 00:24:14,951
Flipping people off
without a moment's hesitation.

281
00:24:16,552 --> 00:24:20,448
But the moment these people
step out of their cars
they turn into The Wimp again.

282
00:24:20,797 --> 00:24:24,137
They fucking cower
as they walk down the street.
Yes, cower.

283
00:24:25,911 --> 00:24:28,207
OK, maybe not cower.

284
00:24:28,729 --> 00:24:30,990
But if somebody bumps into them
do you think they say,

285
00:24:31,025 --> 00:24:33,495
"hey fuck you,
get out of my way".

286
00:24:34,052 --> 00:24:38,366
No, they say "excuse me"
even if it's not their fault.

287
00:24:42,123 --> 00:24:45,603
I bet you're one of those
drivers that flip people off
every chance you get.

288
00:24:45,743 --> 00:24:47,552
Yeah but also in the street too.

289
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:51,239
Oh OK,
well then you're not as bad
as I thought.

290
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:53,466
[frustrated sigh]

291
00:24:56,806 --> 00:25:00,215
Has anything I said penetrated
that virgin brain of yours?

292
00:25:00,946 --> 00:25:03,381
You haven't given five minutes'
thought to why you're here,

293
00:25:03,381 --> 00:25:05,434
or what'll happen to you
when you die.

294
00:25:05,469 --> 00:25:10,618
Well God, or Jesus, or Allah,
or Mother Nature or whatever
you want to call him, her or it,

295
00:25:10,653 --> 00:25:12,636
gave you something
called a brain.

296
00:25:12,671 --> 00:25:16,915
Supposedly your brain
is superior to all the other
animals in this world.

297
00:25:17,507 --> 00:25:20,916
It seems a shame
all you've learned to do with it
is discover two different ways

298
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:24,883
to crush a beer can
and ten different ways
to destroy your brain cells.

299
00:25:30,032 --> 00:25:32,155
I'm giving you
a homework assignment.

300
00:25:32,223 --> 00:25:38,069
I want you to go home tonight
and think about what you see
yourself doing in ten years.

301
00:25:38,173 --> 00:25:42,105
And, if you think you'll be
doing anything other than
working a job you don't like,

302
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:44,471
drinking beer
and trying to get laid,

303
00:25:44,471 --> 00:25:48,158
I want you to write down how
you plan to fulfill your goal.

304
00:25:52,125 --> 00:25:53,517
Until tomorrow...

305
00:25:56,508 --> 00:25:57,552
Too-da-loo!

306
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,283
Hey Sonya I was wondering,
you know I still got
a little time left...

307
00:26:29,561 --> 00:26:31,335
is there anything else
you'd like me to do?

308
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:34,744
How about you do
some filing so I can
stare at you?

309
00:26:35,649 --> 00:26:40,660
-Sure! [laughs] Not a problem.
-No really, you can go home
a little early tonight Stevie

310
00:26:41,077 --> 00:26:43,025
and don't worry,
I won't tell the Judge.

311
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:46,608
OK but um, listen...
you get off soon too, right?

312
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,158
Well, how about we go
grab a bite to eat?

313
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:52,211
You know, nothing formal,
just a friendly meal?

314
00:26:52,245 --> 00:26:54,193
Why are you asking me out now?

315
00:26:54,994 --> 00:26:58,021
I don't know? I mean we seem to
be getting along pretty good...

316
00:26:58,055 --> 00:27:00,177
No, no, no. But why now?

317
00:27:00,943 --> 00:27:03,587
Because Stevie,
you saw me bend over
and that got your

318
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,291
little hormones all revving.

319
00:27:05,884 --> 00:27:08,737
Relax man!
I'm not asking you
to marry me or anything.

320
00:27:09,954 --> 00:27:10,998
Look Stevie...

321
00:27:12,876 --> 00:27:15,416
we have to be together
for a certain amount of time...

322
00:27:15,869 --> 00:27:19,383
and I told myself
I may as well try and be civil,

323
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:24,497
but it's nothing...
absolutely nothing
more than that.

324
00:27:24,914 --> 00:27:27,803
Alright. Forget it. Later.

325
00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:32,256
[rap music]

326
00:27:42,762 --> 00:27:44,328
[sighs]
[rap music continues]

327
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:48,085
What's up?

328
00:27:49,582 --> 00:27:50,625
[Stevie] Hey!

329
00:27:55,044 --> 00:27:56,853
[guitar music]

330
00:28:05,029 --> 00:28:06,838
How's jail time going man?

-Just some shit.

334
00:28:17,867 --> 00:28:20,477
[sighs]
What kind of shit?

335
00:28:21,417 --> 00:28:23,504
Uh, homework.

You maybe want to
do something later?

338
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,028
-Maybe.
-We can get
a couple of beers or something.

339
00:28:33,942 --> 00:28:37,455
Uh, I don't think so.
I'm kind of busy with this.

340
00:28:39,856 --> 00:28:41,526
Alright maybe tomorrow then huh?

341
00:28:41,769 --> 00:28:43,091
Yeah... tomorrow...

342
00:28:50,467 --> 00:28:51,754
[Mark] Alright then.

343
00:28:53,494 --> 00:28:54,538
Later.

344
00:28:55,373 --> 00:28:56,417
[Stevie] Later.

346
00:29:04,871 --> 00:29:07,967
-Hello?
-Hi Stevie, it's Will.

347
00:29:08,977 --> 00:29:14,021
Now I know I'm crossing
the patient-volunteer boundary,
and you know I wouldn't call

348
00:29:14,057 --> 00:29:20,841
if it weren't a dire necessity
and you can tell me to stop
apologizing any time now...

349
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:23,276
I don't mind you calling.
What's up?

350
00:29:23,311 --> 00:29:24,354
Glue.

351
00:29:24,459 --> 00:29:28,425
-Excuse me?
-I'm almost done with my project
but I've run out of glue

352
00:29:28,425 --> 00:29:30,826
and no-one around here
will go and get me any.

353
00:29:32,913 --> 00:29:35,836
-[sighs] Alright.
-Oh and there's one other thing,

354
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:38,132
you're not allowed
in the building at this hour

355
00:29:38,167 --> 00:29:41,124
so you'll have to
take the side entrance.

356
00:29:41,611 --> 00:29:43,282
-[Stevie] Side entrance?

357
00:29:49,787 --> 00:29:51,562

on the way up
but I'm sure it's alright.

362
00:30:15,186 --> 00:30:18,630
I don't suppose you could
go back and get some more?

363
00:30:20,126 --> 00:30:23,396
Oh well, uh... no matter.

364
00:30:25,727 --> 00:30:26,945
[Stevie] Hey... what the...

365
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:31,050
It was the wrong kind anyway...
not strong enough.
I appreciate your effort though.

366
00:30:31,503 --> 00:30:35,817
But, now that you're here
there is something I really
would like to talk about,

367
00:30:35,852 --> 00:30:37,347
so... have a seat.

368
00:30:42,357 --> 00:30:46,463
Well I'm sure that
you've noticed that I have
my share of opinions...

369
00:30:46,498 --> 00:30:51,090
-No! You?
-But there is one thing that
I have virtually no opinion on.

370
00:30:51,334 --> 00:30:55,752
-What? Whether you
have a conscience?
-Lighten up Stevie!

371
00:30:56,553 --> 00:30:58,432
I'm talking about heaven...

372
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,632
I'm not sure if I believe
one exists or not.

373
00:31:01,736 --> 00:31:03,441
Well, I wouldn't
worry about it.

374
00:31:03,615 --> 00:31:04,973
I'm not worried
about getting in,

375
00:31:05,007 --> 00:31:07,339
I'm worried about being
bored to death once I get in.

376
00:31:07,443 --> 00:31:10,435
Well, maybe you can amuse
yourself by sending God
on useless errands.

377
00:31:10,504 --> 00:31:13,774
For instance,
will there be movies and books?

378
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:17,324
Hopefully I've got nothing
to worry about

379
00:31:17,358 --> 00:31:20,315
and it'll have the biggest
library in the whole galaxy.

380
00:31:20,768 --> 00:31:24,873
I could read the latest
Hemingway novels,
the ones he wrote after he died.

381
00:31:24,908 --> 00:31:27,274
Or, maybe go to the theater...

382
00:31:28,248 --> 00:31:30,823
and see what
Shakespeare's written lately.

383
00:31:30,962 --> 00:31:32,283
That's the spirit.

384
00:31:33,293 --> 00:31:36,737
But, if there are movies
and plays and books,

385
00:31:36,737 --> 00:31:39,312
can you imagine how badly
God would censor them.

386
00:31:40,251 --> 00:31:44,461
More than likely I'd spend
the rest of eternity watching
Bob Hope flicks.

387
00:31:45,331 --> 00:31:47,349
And then you'd realize
you were in hell.

388
00:31:47,767 --> 00:31:48,810
Touché!

389
00:31:50,097 --> 00:31:51,837
I should get you
upset more often,

390
00:31:51,872 --> 00:31:54,272
it seems to have
stirred your senses.

391
00:31:54,655 --> 00:31:58,064
And another thing,
do you think they allow
dating up there?

392
00:31:58,587 --> 00:32:01,196
Or is heaven a place where
there is no longer any sex?

393
00:32:01,231 --> 00:32:04,571
No longer any need for
entertainment such a movies...

394
00:32:05,058 --> 00:32:10,415
just an endless flow
of spiritual harmony,
bliss and enlightenment.

395
00:32:13,199 --> 00:32:14,347
Break time over!

396
00:32:14,556 --> 00:32:16,678
You need to stop this
lazing around and get back to

like I'm in purgatory.

410

Before our friendship goes
any further I need to know
what it is you've done.

-You mean about the homework?
-To get in here!

412
00:33:40,979 --> 00:33:44,875
What crime against humanity
did you commit that forced you

413
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:48,494
to squander your time
with a person such as myself.

Must have been
a pretty bad fight.

417
00:34:03,523 --> 00:34:04,741
No, it weren't that bad.

418
00:34:04,777 --> 00:34:06,237
[Will coughs]

419
00:34:08,533 --> 00:34:12,674
And why did you kind of
get into a fight?

[clicks fingers]

421
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,233
Because he was gay... I thought.

You can go now.

-Uh, yeah. He just got
a little pissed off.

Nothing!

428
00:34:52,058 --> 00:34:54,563

that happens around here
is my fault.

that I have against gays...

I mean, I used to never
even trip off them...

[classical music continues]

437
00:36:19,108 --> 00:36:23,630
Um... a few years ago I had
this summer job where we went
around from store to store,

438
00:36:23,804 --> 00:36:25,683
handing out
these free pamphlet things...

439
00:36:27,596 --> 00:36:30,762
and one day I stupidly walked
into this crowded gay bar,

440
00:36:30,972 --> 00:36:34,103
and I asked the bartender
if I could leave some pamphlets
on the counter...

441
00:36:35,738 --> 00:36:40,017
and this bartender dude says
all sexually that no I can't
leave them on the counter,

442
00:36:40,191 --> 00:36:41,896
but I can leave them
in the back room.

443
00:36:44,018 --> 00:36:46,801
Now here I am,
some skinny little 15 year old,

444
00:36:47,115 --> 00:36:49,133
and he wants me to go
in the back room with him.

445
00:36:49,585 --> 00:36:53,482
And he had this strange look
in his eyes that...
scared me to death.

446
00:36:55,325 --> 00:36:57,621
So I pushed my way
through the crowd and took off.

447
00:37:01,066 --> 00:37:05,589
I think ever since that day,
I've always had some kind
of hatred towards gays.

Actually...
maybe I can start
painting right here.

be any smell at all.

had insurance.

Speaking of which...
here are my illustrious parents.

466
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:42,484
I hadn't informed them
I was gay until I found out
I had AIDS.

467
00:38:43,146 --> 00:38:46,834
I wasn't sure which piece of
news would be more devastating,
the fact that I was gay,

468
00:38:47,703 --> 00:38:49,408
or the fact that I was dying.

is larger than her breast size".

498
00:41:08,192 --> 00:41:12,088
I've often thought about
writing a book on the subject,

499
00:41:12,332 --> 00:41:16,333
but that just seems to be
one more thing
we never have time for.

500
00:41:17,968 --> 00:41:24,231
Chapter One states,
"You must never approach
a potential partner... sorry...

501
00:41:24,266 --> 00:41:30,667
an immature 16 year old
when you're with
a group of friends".

502
00:41:31,016 --> 00:41:34,495
I'd never gotten anywhere
when I was with friends
and I'm sure you haven't either.

503
00:41:34,842 --> 00:41:38,287
Once in 200 times doesn't count.

504
00:41:39,678 --> 00:41:44,167
Sample question number one,
"when a young lady passes,
what do you do?"

505
00:41:45,001 --> 00:41:46,393
I know your answer.

506
00:41:46,706 --> 00:41:51,925
You eye her like a wolf and,
if she eyed you back which
she won't, you pounce on her.

507
00:41:53,526 --> 00:41:57,039
Chapter One states
you must never, never, never

508
00:41:57,318 --> 00:41:59,649
approach a young lady first.

509
00:42:00,345 --> 00:42:01,980
Let her notice you.

510
00:42:02,258 --> 00:42:04,241
Let her check you out.

511
00:42:05,425 --> 00:42:07,651
Then, as she passes

512
00:42:08,069 --> 00:42:10,887
you look at her and smile

513
00:42:11,861 --> 00:42:14,609
and your smile
is not one of a wolf, but one

514
00:42:14,645 --> 00:42:19,481
that shows that you are the
sweetest most loving human being
on the face of the planet.

515
00:42:21,116 --> 00:42:25,152
And if she eyes you back,
you'd better have the cojones
to walk up and talk with her.

516
00:42:27,274 --> 00:42:28,318
That's it?

517
00:42:28,492 --> 00:42:30,405
No, that's Chapter One.

518
00:42:30,579 --> 00:42:33,780
I don't if you've ever
seen a book, but there's usually
more than one chapter.

519
00:42:34,406 --> 00:42:38,511
Chapter Two states
you must ask lots of questions,

520
00:42:39,208 --> 00:42:40,947
get a woman
talking about herself

521
00:42:41,295 --> 00:42:43,451
and you'll be
in her pants before dinner.

522
00:42:44,218 --> 00:42:46,583
Yeah, but what if she doesn't
want to talk about herself?

523
00:42:46,618 --> 00:42:48,880
Then she's probably
not worth talking to

524
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,506
unless you're into
unadulterated carnal sex

525
00:42:53,542 --> 00:42:56,012
which I'm sure
you're much too mature for.

526
00:42:57,543 --> 00:42:59,039
What else
does your book have in it?

527
00:42:59,282 --> 00:43:00,708
Oh, there's infinitely more

528
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:04,292
but I can only cram
so much into your tiny skull
at one time.

529
00:43:12,886 --> 00:43:13,930
[Stevie] Hello.

530
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:20,714
Yes?

531
00:43:21,305 --> 00:43:23,045
I was just
stopping by to say hi.

532
00:43:24,959 --> 00:43:26,385
So, how're you doing?

533
00:43:27,394 --> 00:43:28,542
Fine.

534
00:43:30,212 --> 00:43:31,812
Catching up with some paperwork?

535
00:43:32,125 --> 00:43:34,909
Trying to...
Stevie, what is it
I can help you with?

536
00:43:35,709 --> 00:43:38,980
Nothing.
Um, I was just seeing
how you're doing.

537
00:43:39,988 --> 00:43:42,668
So, what else do you do
when you're not working?

538
00:43:44,442 --> 00:43:47,190
I go to school,
three nights a week
at San Francisco State.

539
00:43:47,295 --> 00:43:51,087
[quiet music]

540
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:52,305
What's your major?

541
00:43:52,792 --> 00:43:53,905
Liberal Studies.

542
00:43:55,053 --> 00:43:56,375
Liberal Studies...

543
00:43:56,654 --> 00:43:57,767
Liberal Studies.

544
00:44:00,133 --> 00:44:01,942
What can you do with that?

545
00:44:04,134 --> 00:44:05,631
I think I'd like to teach.

546
00:44:06,222 --> 00:44:09,179
I'm not sure
if I'd like to teach children
or at the adult level

547
00:44:09,213 --> 00:44:11,405
but I still
have a couple of years
to figure that out.

548
00:44:12,589 --> 00:44:15,372
But right now, Stevie,
I really have to
get back to work.

549
00:44:16,033 --> 00:44:18,016
-Okay.
-Okay.

550
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,948
[Stevie]
So what are you working on?

551
00:44:23,304 --> 00:44:25,044
I really
have to get back to work.

552
00:44:26,506 --> 00:44:27,549
Okay.

553
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:38,787
[Stevie]
What's in Chapter Three?

554
00:44:41,465 --> 00:44:43,379
It is time
for the moment of truth.

555
00:44:44,528 --> 00:44:48,355
My only fear
is this puppy will fly so far,
we'll never be able to find it.

556
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:58,201
[uneven mechanical sounds]

557
00:45:00,984 --> 00:45:03,245
Well, let's see.

558
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:07,351
Back to things
of real importance.

559
00:45:08,777 --> 00:45:09,821
Girl trouble.

560
00:45:11,247 --> 00:45:15,631
Chapter Three states
that you must prove yourself
to be the sensitive kind.

561
00:45:16,884 --> 00:45:17,997
How do I pull that off?

562
00:45:18,832 --> 00:45:20,224
Open yourself up to her.

563
00:45:20,745 --> 00:45:22,416
Reveal some hidden
part of yourself.

564
00:45:23,147 --> 00:45:24,956
Let her in
on something personal.

565
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:26,973
- Like what?
- You tell me.

566
00:45:30,105 --> 00:45:31,635
[sighs] I don't know.

567
00:45:32,888 --> 00:45:35,984
Remember when
you told me about the incident
with the gay bartender?

568
00:45:36,367 --> 00:45:39,324
I didn't necessarily agree
with your take on the event

569
00:45:39,533 --> 00:45:43,151
but the fact that you tried
to understand your feelings
was beautiful.

570
00:45:43,673 --> 00:45:44,752
Yes, uhuh.

571
00:45:46,005 --> 00:45:48,057
I'll look up that information
and get back to you.

572
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:51,432
[Sonya] Okay, thank you.

573
00:45:51,885 --> 00:45:52,928
Bye-bye.

574
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:57,208
I thought you went home already.

575
00:45:57,869 --> 00:46:00,617
No, I was just reflecting.

576
00:46:01,313 --> 00:46:02,948
[phone rings]
Excuse me.

577
00:46:03,296 --> 00:46:04,340
[Sonya] Wilkes hospice?

578
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:09,141
Oh, that'd be great!
You can come visit him
any time you'd like.

579
00:46:10,011 --> 00:46:11,055
Sure!

580
00:46:11,542 --> 00:46:12,586
Okay, bye-bye.

581
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:15,020
I need to see
the files for Alex O'Neill.

582
00:46:18,152 --> 00:46:20,518
[shuffling through files]

583
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:26,920
-What is it
I can help you with, Stevie?
-I can wait.

584
00:46:29,911 --> 00:46:33,529
[shuffling through files]

585
00:46:42,785 --> 00:46:43,828
Thank you very much.

586
00:46:48,247 --> 00:46:49,708
I just wanted
to tell you something.

587
00:46:49,917 --> 00:46:52,248
It's not
all that important or anything.
It's just that...

588
00:46:52,283 --> 00:46:53,849
When I was a kid
I used to have this--

589
00:46:53,883 --> 00:46:55,101
Hey Sonya. Any messages?

590
00:46:55,658 --> 00:46:57,119
No, sorry.

591
00:47:00,076 --> 00:47:03,590
I swear if his girlfriend
doesn't call every 10 minutes,
he thinks something's wrong.

592
00:47:04,216 --> 00:47:05,503
OK, what were you saying?

593
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,740
Oh,
just that I had this neighbor
that nobody liked, all right?

594
00:47:09,053 --> 00:47:11,975
She was this old lady
and everyone thought of her
as some kind of witch.

595
00:47:13,402 --> 00:47:14,445
Hey!

596
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:17,681
Well, anyway,
my neighbor, she never talked
to anyone, right?

597
00:47:18,098 --> 00:47:20,708
And one day
when me and a couple of buddies
were playing

598
00:47:20,708 --> 00:47:23,665
football in the street,
the ball got thrown
into her front yard.

599
00:47:24,291 --> 00:47:25,927
- I went to get it--
- Thanks, Sonya.

600
00:47:28,293 --> 00:47:29,336
Good luck.

601
00:47:34,137 --> 00:47:35,772
Well,
I didn't want
to go near the house.

602
00:47:35,842 --> 00:47:38,034
It kinda gave me the creeps,
you know what I'm saying?

603
00:47:38,243 --> 00:47:40,261
[sighs]
But I had to, so...

604
00:47:40,922 --> 00:47:43,566
Just as I'm
reaching for the ball,
the old lady appears.

605
00:47:43,601 --> 00:47:44,644
[gasps]

606
00:47:48,402 --> 00:47:50,384
I thought she was
going to bite me or something

607
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:54,455
but she said,
"I hope one day I'll see you
playing for the 49ers."

608
00:47:55,499 --> 00:47:58,074
And she said it
so sweetly, you know?

609
00:47:58,492 --> 00:48:01,831
I realized all those rumors
about her being a witch
were just a bunch of bullsh--

610
00:48:02,736 --> 00:48:04,302
Well, they weren't true.

611
00:48:06,772 --> 00:48:08,198
She died a couple weeks later.

612
00:48:09,869 --> 00:48:12,513
[sighs]
I think I was the only one
on my block to know

613
00:48:12,582 --> 00:48:14,496
that she was actually
a very sweet old lady.

614
00:48:14,565 --> 00:48:18,844
[soft music]

615
00:48:18,984 --> 00:48:20,028
[sniff]

616
00:48:20,166 --> 00:48:25,002
[soft music continues]

617
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:33,388
I'll make you a deal, Stevie.

618
00:48:35,127 --> 00:48:38,815
If you stop telling me
these stories
and asking me questions

619
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:39,963
and allow me to work

620
00:48:40,624 --> 00:48:42,538
maybe afterward
we can go get a bite to eat.

621
00:48:42,677 --> 00:48:43,721
After work?

622
00:48:44,973 --> 00:48:46,365
I know of a place we can go.

623
00:48:47,513 --> 00:48:48,800
Just a friendly meal, right?

624
00:48:52,314 --> 00:48:57,741
[exciting upbeat music]

625
00:48:57,777 --> 00:48:59,099
[Billy] Here you are, gorgeous.

626
00:48:59,133 --> 00:49:00,421
How's everything going, Billy?

627
00:49:00,456 --> 00:49:02,543
Well, my work is killing me.

628
00:49:02,577 --> 00:49:05,604
It takes them about two hours
to slice a bag of carrots.

629
00:49:06,614 --> 00:49:07,692
So who's this?

630
00:49:07,866 --> 00:49:09,084
Your little cousin?

631
00:49:10,058 --> 00:49:12,250
[Sonya]
No, this is my friend Stevie.
Stevie, Billy.

632
00:49:12,528 --> 00:49:14,407
A pleasure, I'm sure. Huh?

633
00:49:14,616 --> 00:49:16,286
[Billy and Sonya laughing]

634
00:49:16,634 --> 00:49:18,443
So, what else can I get you?

635
00:49:18,512 --> 00:49:21,713
Um, how about a bran muffin
and a shot of your wheat-grass.

636
00:49:23,731 --> 00:49:25,019
[Billy] You too, huh?

637
00:49:25,331 --> 00:49:26,375
No, thanks.

638
00:49:26,411 --> 00:49:29,751
[Billy] I'll tell you what,
I'll make you one on the house.

639
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:31,281
Ooh, great.

640
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:32,603
Great!

641
00:49:32,673 --> 00:49:36,466
[upbeat music continues]

642
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,448
[Sonya] I used to feel
the same way as you,

643
00:49:38,448 --> 00:49:41,753
but I got so tired of Billy
pestering me all the time
that I just gave in.

644
00:49:41,789 --> 00:49:44,223
[upbeat music continues]

645
00:49:44,259 --> 00:49:45,615
Hey, what is this?

646
00:49:46,242 --> 00:49:47,320
Carrot and spinach

647
00:49:47,355 --> 00:49:49,338
and I have them throw in
a little protein powder.

648
00:49:49,373 --> 00:49:52,156
[upbeat music continues]

649
00:49:52,191 --> 00:49:54,905
Here you go,
fresh from my garden.

650
00:49:54,939 --> 00:49:55,983
[Sonya] Thanks, Billy.

651
00:49:56,087 --> 00:50:01,133
[upbeat music continues]

652
00:50:04,507 --> 00:50:05,725
[coughs]

653
00:50:05,864 --> 00:50:08,752
Oh, hey,
it's kind of an acquired taste,
huh?

654
00:50:09,135 --> 00:50:11,883
You have to drink
about five or six of them
to get used to it.

655
00:50:13,101 --> 00:50:14,736
Hey, line them up!

656
00:50:15,606 --> 00:50:17,693
You know what, Stevie?
I like you.

657
00:50:18,494 --> 00:50:21,590
I think I'll kill you last!
[laughs]

658
00:50:22,112 --> 00:50:24,338
Hey, come on
with a cappuccino already, huh?

659
00:50:24,651 --> 00:50:27,157
I've shown them ten times
how to make a cup of coffee.

660
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:28,722
What could be so difficult?

661
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:33,732
So, now that you've had it,
do you feel any extra energy?

662
00:50:34,255 --> 00:50:35,855
I feel an upset stomach.

663
00:50:37,943 --> 00:50:40,447
Anyway,
so how come you work
at the hospice?

664
00:50:40,482 --> 00:50:42,952
I mean,
it seems to me like
you get kind of depressed

665
00:50:42,987 --> 00:50:45,700
in knowing
everyone you're working with

I didn't apologize.

I only came home
because I had stayed out
in the cold the night before

to do it a second night.

too mature to go looking
for unadulterated carnal sex.

01:04:01,215 --> 01:04:03,024
Oh God, what if this...

841
01:04:03,824 --> 01:04:06,294
What if this is all
a metaphor of marriage?

842
01:04:09,773 --> 01:04:11,965
Everything being roses at first.

843
01:04:14,365 --> 01:04:15,966
But then the rose wilts.

844
01:04:17,462 --> 01:04:18,680
And the petals fall off.

845
01:04:21,046 --> 01:04:23,133
And all you're left with
is a stem.

846
01:04:25,081 --> 01:04:26,473
And a few thorns

847
01:04:26,891 --> 01:04:28,769
that you never even knew
were there.

848
01:04:28,874 --> 01:04:33,884
[music continues]

849
01:04:36,528 --> 01:04:37,780
I think I need a dance.

850
01:04:38,824 --> 01:04:43,139
Well, I don't want to. That way,
if we ever go to a club again
and I don't want to dance

851
01:04:43,486 --> 01:04:45,818
you won't be able to say
I'm turning into a thorny stem.

852
01:04:46,757 --> 01:04:48,426
Because you already are one?

853
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:54,063
[music continues]

854
01:05:03,423 --> 01:05:07,598
[music continues]

855
01:05:25,342 --> 01:05:27,185
Thanks for a wonderful night,
Stevie.

856
01:05:27,289 --> 01:05:32,474
[quiet music]

857
01:05:32,542 --> 01:05:34,353
It's getting late,
I'd better be getting in.

858
01:05:34,387 --> 01:05:36,649
We both have to be
at the hospice in a few hours.

859
01:05:36,717 --> 01:05:42,110
[quiet music continues]

860
01:05:45,277 --> 01:05:46,321
Well...

861
01:05:46,772 --> 01:05:47,816
Goodnight.

862
01:05:50,217 --> 01:05:52,583
Son, um...

863
01:05:53,453 --> 01:05:54,601
See you in a few hours.

864
01:05:54,671 --> 01:05:58,080
[quiet music continues]

865
01:05:58,149 --> 01:06:00,307
When's the last time
you've done this?

866
01:06:01,525 --> 01:06:02,568
Done what?

867
01:06:04,447 --> 01:06:06,499
Been out on a date
and not made a move.

868
01:06:09,179 --> 01:06:10,710
Not for a long time...

869
01:06:11,858 --> 01:06:12,902
if ever.

870
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:18,677
[romantic music]

871
01:06:18,816 --> 01:06:21,634
I'd get out of here
before I ruin the night
and get myself slapped.

872
01:06:21,704 --> 01:06:25,739
[romantic music continues]

873
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:31,932
[Sonya]
Oh, and by the way...

874
01:06:33,116 --> 01:06:34,681
You wouldn't
have gotten slapped.

875
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:35,934
[door closing]

876
01:06:37,569 --> 01:06:41,848
[upbeat music]

877
01:06:44,805 --> 01:06:49,154
[upbeat music continues]

878
01:07:18,866 --> 01:07:23,354
Oh, my, my!
Look what the cat dragged in.

879
01:07:24,746 --> 01:07:27,529
So,
I take it your date
went pretty well, then?

880
01:07:28,713 --> 01:07:29,895
Who told you I had a date?

881
01:07:30,556 --> 01:07:32,714
Don't play coy with me,
young man.

882
01:07:33,236 --> 01:07:35,601
You should know by now
there are no secrets in here.

883
01:07:36,123 --> 01:07:38,002
So tell me.
Did you kiss her?

884
01:07:38,698 --> 01:07:39,846
Did you kiss her twice?

885
01:07:40,054 --> 01:07:41,969
Did you see
what color panties she wore?

886
01:07:42,316 --> 01:07:45,134
Details, Stevie!
I need details!

887
01:07:45,970 --> 01:07:47,743
Gentlemen don't kiss and tell.

888
01:07:47,779 --> 01:07:49,727
Gentlemen, are we now?

889
01:07:51,049 --> 01:07:53,346
That means
you didn't get a kiss goodnight.

890
01:07:54,841 --> 01:07:55,955
Not to worry.

891
01:07:56,824 --> 01:07:59,713
Chapter Four states
it is usually better
in the long run

892
01:07:59,713 --> 01:08:02,252
if you don't do anything
in the short run.

893
01:08:03,087 --> 01:08:05,523
What is with the two of you?

894
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:07,749
Girlfriend,
wouldn't you like to know?

895
01:08:09,454 --> 01:08:10,497
Well.

896
01:08:10,671 --> 01:08:13,837
I see my flaming buoyancy
no longer embarrasses you

897
01:08:13,873 --> 01:08:15,820
to the point
of having to leave the room.

898
01:08:16,273 --> 01:08:19,056
So, the only thing left is

899
01:08:20,065 --> 01:08:21,283
for us to be friends.

900
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:23,231
Hi, I'm James.

901
01:08:24,727 --> 01:08:25,841
Stevie.

902
01:08:26,154 --> 01:08:30,607
[Will]
Oh, now isn't that precious.
[chuckling]

903
01:08:31,929 --> 01:08:32,973
Ohhh.

904
01:08:35,652 --> 01:08:38,227
You are both in
for a special treat.

905
01:08:38,262 --> 01:08:40,383
I've made
a few minor adjustments.

906
01:08:40,592 --> 01:08:44,594
And it is now time
to demonstrate
the ultimate flying machine!

907
01:08:50,995 --> 01:08:52,804
[uneven mechanical sounds]

908
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:02,546
[Will's father]
Let's have a look.

909
01:09:12,984 --> 01:09:14,166
Good workmanship.

910
01:09:19,038 --> 01:09:20,360
[uneven mechanical sound]

911
01:09:20,394 --> 01:09:23,039
Mmm,
I think with a longer string

912
01:09:23,630 --> 01:09:25,543
we should be able
to get this up and running.

913
01:09:30,762 --> 01:09:32,120
That should about do it.

914
01:09:32,154 --> 01:09:36,016
[uplifting music]

915
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:40,121
[whirring sound]

916
01:09:40,191 --> 01:09:44,645
[inspirational music]

917
01:09:48,645 --> 01:09:49,689
Hey girls.

918
01:09:49,793 --> 01:09:52,855
[upbeat music]

919
01:09:56,473 --> 01:10:00,057
[ominous dramatic music]

920
01:10:07,015 --> 01:10:09,207
What happened to Carlos?
Did he move out of his room?

921
01:10:10,599 --> 01:10:12,826
Carlos died Stevie. I'm sorry.

922
01:10:12,860 --> 01:10:13,938
I thought you knew.

923
01:10:42,746 --> 01:10:43,790
[door closing]

924
01:10:45,878 --> 01:10:47,408
It's not your fault, Stevie.

925
01:10:57,429 --> 01:10:58,890
Carlos was very sick.

926
01:11:01,430 --> 01:11:02,473
It's Ok.

927
01:11:03,309 --> 01:11:04,352
It's Ok.

928
01:11:04,944 --> 01:11:07,831
[sighing deeply and sobs]

929
01:11:08,562 --> 01:11:09,606
You know...

930
01:11:10,998 --> 01:11:15,277
The only thing I keep
thinking about is the look
on his face when I left.

931
01:11:19,382 --> 01:11:21,818
I was probably
one of his last visitors.

932
01:11:23,314 --> 01:11:24,983
And I treated him like shit.

933
01:11:26,654 --> 01:11:27,766
[sobbing]

934
01:12:00,018 --> 01:12:01,933
Well, goodbye, son.

935
01:12:33,001 --> 01:12:35,646
The boy has become a man.

936
01:12:36,794 --> 01:12:39,681
And I don't mean
in a sexual sense.

937
01:12:40,865 --> 01:12:42,639
You have come of age.

938
01:12:43,543 --> 01:12:47,788
No longer are you
some foul-mouthed
brain-dead teenager.

939
01:12:48,067 --> 01:12:52,624
You have developed
into a caring, inquisitive
young man.

940
01:12:53,738 --> 01:12:57,530
From this day forward,
you shall no longer
be called Stevie.

941
01:12:58,608 --> 01:13:02,261
From now on,
you shall be known as Steven.

942
01:13:04,731 --> 01:13:05,775
Steven.

943
01:13:06,297 --> 01:13:08,315
You know,
I never liked
the sound of that before.

944
01:13:08,942 --> 01:13:12,212
But from this day forth
I think I shall hear it
in a different light.

945
01:13:12,212 --> 01:13:14,439
Don't get carried away
on me, Steven.

946
01:13:14,613 --> 01:13:17,604
If I act grandiose,
it's fairly amusing.

947
01:13:17,779 --> 01:13:21,048
If we both act grandiose,
we sound like babbling idiots.

948
01:13:22,023 --> 01:13:24,215
Well, I guess this young man
has much to learn, huh?

949
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:26,129
Mmm, who doesn't?

950
01:13:28,947 --> 01:13:29,991
Next.

951
01:13:33,435 --> 01:13:36,009
Hi, I'd like to register
for next semester.

952
01:13:36,496 --> 01:13:38,027
OK,
you need to
fill out these forms,

953
01:13:38,062 --> 01:13:41,541
bring them back to me
and then you have to go upstairs
and take the placement tests.

954
01:13:41,576 --> 01:13:42,620
Next.

955
01:13:45,194 --> 01:13:46,865
The tests aren't pass or fail

956
01:13:46,899 --> 01:13:49,300
they're just to determine
what level you should start at.

957
01:13:50,935 --> 01:13:51,978
Thanks.

958
01:13:52,361 --> 01:13:53,405
So how'd it go?

959
01:13:54,693 --> 01:13:55,736
Put it this way.

960
01:13:55,771 --> 01:13:59,042
I think all my classmates
will be foreign students
who don't speak any English.

961
01:13:59,076 --> 01:14:00,155
[laughing together]

962
01:14:00,155 --> 01:14:02,277
No, I'm kidding.
Come on, let's get out of here.

963
01:14:02,312 --> 01:14:07,218
[exciting music]

964
01:14:07,287 --> 01:14:10,383
Oh, oh, look at that.
Look at that.

965
01:14:11,671 --> 01:14:12,749
Seeing something?

966
01:14:14,941 --> 01:14:17,307
Hey!
Hey, how's it going?

967
01:14:20,612 --> 01:14:24,613
[laughing] Man,
do you expect to get anywhere
with a line like that?

968
01:14:32,025 --> 01:14:33,068
[door opening]

969
01:14:35,016 --> 01:14:36,060
[door closing]

970
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:49,803
[quiet music]

971
01:14:51,716 --> 01:14:53,455
I always thought

972
01:14:54,395 --> 01:14:56,865
when death crept closer that

973
01:14:58,013 --> 01:15:00,553
other things
would lose their importance

974
01:15:03,441 --> 01:15:04,485
Prejudice

975
01:15:05,319 --> 01:15:06,363
Poli-tricks...

976
01:15:07,581 --> 01:15:08,973
World atrocities...

977
01:15:12,139 --> 01:15:15,897
I thought I would see
that none of it
was of real significance.

978
01:15:17,079 --> 01:15:19,689
That life was the only thing
of consequence.

979
01:15:22,959 --> 01:15:24,525
But it seems so vivid.

980
01:15:27,586 --> 01:15:29,814
It matters more than ever,
because

981
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:34,336
I've used up my chance
to do anything about them.

982
01:15:39,694 --> 01:15:41,329
It might seem absurd,

983
01:15:42,547 --> 01:15:47,139
but my goal when I died
was to have two lines
on my tombstone.

984
01:15:48,566 --> 01:15:50,793
But not everyone
deserves a second line.

985
01:15:52,324 --> 01:15:54,515
A line that tells
of their accomplishments.

986
01:15:54,690 --> 01:15:58,238
One that proves,
after all, it's written in stone

987
01:16:01,613 --> 01:16:05,127
that you served a purpose
on this planet.

988
01:16:10,102 --> 01:16:13,025
But I haven't
eliminated nuclear weapons,

989
01:16:15,703 --> 01:16:17,722
haven't brought about
world peace,

990
01:16:18,522 --> 01:16:22,174
haven't organized a relief fund
to end world hunger,

991
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:28,264
I've made a couple of toys
that are not that original.

992
01:16:31,395 --> 01:16:33,239
I always wanted
that second line.

993
01:16:35,396 --> 01:16:37,518
Now I know I'll never have it.

994
01:16:37,901 --> 01:16:41,276
You know, Will... sometimes

995
01:16:42,632 --> 01:16:44,094
you can be so full of shit.

996
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:49,626
I mean you have a second line.

997
01:16:50,147 --> 01:16:51,226
You made toys.

998
01:16:52,479 --> 01:16:53,557
And you've also...

999
01:16:56,724 --> 01:16:58,811
-You've made a difference
in my life.
-[Will] Wait.

1000
01:16:59,715 --> 01:17:01,211
Is there a soap opera on?

1001
01:17:02,882 --> 01:17:04,412
Well, you have. I mean...

1002
01:17:05,038 --> 01:17:06,604
Think I would have
enrolled in school?

1003
01:17:07,091 --> 01:17:08,900
You're killing me.

1004
01:17:09,039 --> 01:17:13,806
"Would have" enrolled in school,
not "would've" enrolled in.

1005
01:17:15,858 --> 01:17:18,677
You've mangled
the English language
time and time again.

1006
01:17:19,059 --> 01:17:22,922
I'd die happy if just once
you spoke correctly.

1007
01:17:24,869 --> 01:17:27,131
You think I would have Sonya
as my girlfriend?

1008
01:17:27,932 --> 01:17:29,497
Girlfriend, is she now?

1009
01:17:30,297 --> 01:17:34,367
And it's "do you think I would
have Sonya as my girlfriend?"

1010
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:36,421
You never speak
in a complete sentence.

1011
01:17:36,455 --> 01:17:41,222
It's always
these choppy, unintelligible
improper sentences.

1012
01:17:41,361 --> 01:17:45,884
[quiet music continues]

1013
01:17:47,380 --> 01:17:48,459
Cat got your tongue?

1014
01:17:50,859 --> 01:17:54,860
Yes, I guess I am
partially responsible

1015
01:17:54,860 --> 01:17:58,305
for the upgrading
of your once-miserable life.

1016
01:18:02,967 --> 01:18:04,011
[coughs]

1017
01:18:09,159 --> 01:18:14,761
So, does this mean
you'll no longer participate
in another fag-bashing?

1018
01:18:16,605 --> 01:18:17,996
Well, what do you know?

1019
01:18:19,875 --> 01:18:24,573
In one fell swoop
I've managed to end prejudice
and create world peace.

1020
01:18:26,416 --> 01:18:28,852
I guess a "thank you"
is in order.

1021
01:18:29,199 --> 01:18:34,071
[quiet music continues]

1022
01:18:35,671 --> 01:18:37,828
[sighs]
Thank you, Will.

1023
01:18:42,073 --> 01:18:44,508
You've taught me a lot and
made me a much better person.

1024
01:18:44,543 --> 01:18:47,291
I think I can now live
a much fuller, enriching life.

1025
01:18:49,657 --> 01:18:50,701
Don't mention it.

1026
01:18:52,684 --> 01:18:57,590
And now leave me
so I can catch up
on my beauty rest.

1027
01:18:58,529 --> 01:19:03,853
[quiet music continues]

1028
01:19:04,827 --> 01:19:05,870
Mmm.

1029
01:19:06,740 --> 01:19:10,324
I think for the first time
in a long time I'm going to get
a good night's sleep.

1030
01:19:12,968 --> 01:19:14,951
It'll disprove
one of my theories.

1031
01:19:15,925 --> 01:19:17,212
But what the hell.

1032
01:19:19,892 --> 01:19:22,083
The night doesn't always win.

1033
01:19:32,799 --> 01:19:37,009
[sad saxophone music]

1034
01:19:53,187 --> 01:19:55,484
[Stevie] I was able
to convince his parents
to bury Will

1035
01:19:55,484 --> 01:19:57,014
next to a tree
in their back yard.

1036
01:19:58,615 --> 01:19:59,901
It's slightly against the law.

1037
01:20:00,598 --> 01:20:03,277
But so was Will's sexual
preference in 37 states.

1038
01:20:06,199 --> 01:20:08,844
I wasn't able
to persuade them into forgetting
about the coffin.

1039
01:20:09,052 --> 01:20:13,644
[sad music continues]

1040
01:20:17,715 --> 01:20:21,403
You see, Will would say
that his coffin was the waste
of a perfectly good tree.

1041
01:20:23,908 --> 01:20:26,031
Maybe I can plant a tree out
here to make up for it.

1042
01:20:28,327 --> 01:20:30,519
Or maybe I'll plant one
when I have my own back yard.

1043
01:20:33,127 --> 01:20:34,171
Who knows?

1044
01:20:34,485 --> 01:20:36,955
Maybe I'll never have a back
yard and forget all about Will.

1045
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,436
But I prefer to think that I'll
remember to plant that tree.

1046
01:20:45,548 --> 01:20:48,367
And maybe, when the time comes

1047
01:20:50,315 --> 01:20:52,055
I'll ask to be buried
next to that tree.

1048
01:20:52,263 --> 01:20:56,021
[sad music continues]
