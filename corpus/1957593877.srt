00:00:01,217 --> 00:00:04,050
(MultiCom Jingle)

00:00:13,835 --> 00:00:16,335
(grand piano)

3
00:00:40,451 --> 00:00:43,118
(phone ringing)

4
00:00:51,947 --> 00:00:52,896
- Hello?

5
00:00:52,896 --> 00:00:54,208
- [Walter] Bob?

6
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:55,041
Walter Winchell.

7
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:55,874
- Walt.

8
00:00:58,509 --> 00:01:00,037
- [Walter] It's Marilyn.

9
00:01:00,037 --> 00:01:02,509
I'm sorry to have to tell you this.

10
00:01:02,509 --> 00:01:04,342
She died this morning.

11
00:01:05,435 --> 00:01:06,268
Bob?

12
00:01:07,311 --> 00:01:08,144
- Hold on.

13
00:01:12,861 --> 00:01:13,694
Okay.

14
00:01:14,656 --> 00:01:17,084
- [Walter] They think it's suicide.

15
00:01:17,084 --> 00:01:18,888
One more thing.

16
00:01:18,888 --> 00:01:21,981
No one is claiming the body.

17
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:24,814
Would you come out to the funeral?

18
00:01:29,571 --> 00:01:31,123
- Yeah.

19
00:01:31,123 --> 00:01:33,839
Yeah, I want to be there for her.

20
00:01:33,839 --> 00:01:36,006
- [Walter] Bob, I'm sorry.

21
00:01:38,135 --> 00:01:39,593
- [Bob] Thanks, Walter.

22
00:01:39,593 --> 00:01:42,260
(piano resumes)

23
00:02:13,701 --> 00:02:14,639
- Can I help you?

24
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,099
- [Bob] I understand no one's

25
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:18,035
claimed the body of Marilyn Monroe.

26
00:02:18,035 --> 00:02:20,188
- What business is that of yours?

27
00:02:20,188 --> 00:02:22,659
- I'm here to claim it myself.

28
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:23,492
- I see.

29
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,565
What's your relationship to the deceased?

30
00:02:26,565 --> 00:02:28,232
- I was her husband.

31
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:34,730
- [Orderly] Are you Jim Dougherty?

32
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,936
- No, my name is Bob Slatzer.

33
00:02:36,936 --> 00:02:39,102
- You're not Arthur Miller.

34
00:02:39,102 --> 00:02:40,714
- [Bob] Bob Slatzer.

35
00:02:40,714 --> 00:02:42,411
- And I know you're not Joe DiMaggio.

36
00:02:42,411 --> 00:02:44,372
- My name is Slatzer.

37
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,545
- Your name isn't on the list.

38
00:02:46,545 --> 00:02:49,648
And if it isn't on the list,
you weren't married to her.

39
00:02:49,648 --> 00:02:50,795
- Now wait a minute.

40
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:51,637
- Look mister, either you're

41
00:02:51,637 --> 00:02:54,188
just another fan of
getting too carried away

42
00:02:54,188 --> 00:02:57,380
or your marriage was one of
the world's best kept secrets.

43
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:01,813
Either way, if you don't leave,
I'll have to call the cops.

44
00:03:01,813 --> 00:03:04,313
(somber jazz)

45
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:25,784
- [Bob, Interally] To
me she wasn't a star.

46
00:03:25,784 --> 00:03:28,416
She wasn't even Marilyn Monroe.

47
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,499
To me she was Norma Jean.

48
00:03:32,354 --> 00:03:34,981
Always was, always will be.

49
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:37,481
(upbeat jazz)

50
00:03:43,228 --> 00:03:45,165
I was writing stories about movie stars

51
00:03:45,165 --> 00:03:47,412
for a newspaper back in Ohio.

52
00:03:47,412 --> 00:03:50,834
I got paid by the story
when I could hunt one down.

53
00:03:50,834 --> 00:03:52,640
Things weren't going too well

54
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,106
and the paper wanted me to come home

55
00:03:54,106 --> 00:03:56,697
but I didn't want to leave.

56
00:03:56,697 --> 00:03:58,531
And then, one morning while I was waiting

57
00:03:58,531 --> 00:04:01,198
to interview a casting director.

58
00:04:15,674 --> 00:04:16,507
You okay?

59
00:04:20,815 --> 00:04:23,859
- And then the very moment,
the danger was over.

60
00:04:23,859 --> 00:04:25,588
It was as if nothing had happened.

61
00:04:25,588 --> 00:04:28,338
I was again your doll, your lark.

62
00:04:29,611 --> 00:04:30,444
- Excuse me?

63
00:04:30,444 --> 00:04:33,795
- It's from the play you
were reading, A Doll's House.

64
00:04:33,795 --> 00:04:34,956
I did Nora in Van Nuys.

65
00:04:34,956 --> 00:04:35,875
- Oh, I see.

66
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,744
I didn't recognize it.

67
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:40,577
I guess I didn't get that far yet.

68
00:04:41,828 --> 00:04:43,527
- Waiting here for an audition?

69
00:04:43,527 --> 00:04:44,738
- No, just for fun.

70
00:04:44,738 --> 00:04:46,182
- Oh.

71
00:04:46,182 --> 00:04:47,582
You're not an actor?

72
00:04:47,582 --> 00:04:48,415
- Oh no.

73
00:04:49,444 --> 00:04:50,442
- I'm Norma Jean Baker.

74
00:04:50,442 --> 00:04:52,109
- [Bob] Bob Slatzer.

75
00:04:53,331 --> 00:04:54,966
- I think I'll call you Ibsen.

76
00:04:54,966 --> 00:04:57,214
You're the only man I've
ever met in Hollywood

77
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:59,224
who wasn't reading Ibsen for anything

78
00:04:59,224 --> 00:05:01,202
but a scene in an acting class.

79
00:05:01,202 --> 00:05:02,035
You work here?

80
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:03,317
- Well yes and no.

81
00:05:03,317 --> 00:05:04,692
I'm a writer.

82
00:05:04,692 --> 00:05:07,881
Well actually, I'm trying
to make it as a screenwriter

83
00:05:07,881 --> 00:05:12,171
but mostly I freelance
articles for a paper in Ohio.

84
00:05:12,171 --> 00:05:13,747
- Oh.

85
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:15,071
I love writers.

86
00:05:15,071 --> 00:05:16,318
The sexiest thing in the world

87
00:05:16,318 --> 00:05:18,112
isn't Darryl Flynn with his pants off,

88
00:05:18,112 --> 00:05:20,614
it's Hemingway with his hat on.

89
00:05:20,614 --> 00:05:21,448
- [Woman In The Distance]
Norma Jean Baker.

90
00:05:21,448 --> 00:05:24,115
- That's my big call to stardom.

91
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,667
(jazz resumes)

92
00:05:28,667 --> 00:05:29,500
Oh, Ibsen.

93
00:05:31,652 --> 00:05:35,297
I was looking for someone
to help me write my resume.

94
00:05:35,297 --> 00:05:36,558
- [Bob] Well, um.

95
00:05:36,558 --> 00:05:38,802
- Maybe we could talk
about it over dinner?

96
00:05:38,802 --> 00:05:39,946
- Dinner?

97
00:05:39,946 --> 00:05:41,718
I, yeah, I'd love to.

98
00:05:41,718 --> 00:05:43,407
- How about tonight?

99
00:05:43,407 --> 00:05:47,553
Pick me up at the 'brask
and Barrington at seven.

100
00:05:47,553 --> 00:05:51,664
- [Bob] Oh, is that the corner
of Nebraska and Barrington?

101
00:05:51,664 --> 00:05:54,826
- That's it. See you at seven.

102
00:05:54,826 --> 00:05:57,326
(upbeat jazz)

103
00:06:23,112 --> 00:06:24,475
- [Norma] Hi.

104
00:06:24,475 --> 00:06:25,308
- Hi.

105
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:32,384
- Oh.

106
00:06:33,405 --> 00:06:35,738
White roses are my favorite.

107
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:40,797
Did you know that white roses
were kissed twice by the sun?

108
00:06:44,466 --> 00:06:46,157
You're shy.

109
00:06:46,157 --> 00:06:47,585
That's beautiful.

110
00:06:47,585 --> 00:06:50,694
- Yeah, it's always been
a little bit of a problem.

111
00:06:50,694 --> 00:06:52,361
- I think it's nice.

112
00:07:05,876 --> 00:07:09,376
Do you know what white roses are good for?

113
00:07:13,446 --> 00:07:14,529
Breath mints.

114
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:24,765
I love driving past these big old houses.

115
00:07:24,765 --> 00:07:27,036
But they're too cold, too dark.

116
00:07:27,036 --> 00:07:29,895
I'd never live here no
matter how much money I make.

117
00:07:29,895 --> 00:07:31,900
- Plan to make a lot of money, do you?

118
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,913
- If they'd ever let me show
them how good I could be.

119
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:37,094
- They won't let you act now?

120
00:07:37,094 --> 00:07:39,832
- The casting executives
take one look at me

121
00:07:39,832 --> 00:07:43,220
and they see me as a nude model.

122
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,751
Or maybe they see me flat on my back.

123
00:07:45,751 --> 00:07:46,851
(giggles)

124
00:07:46,851 --> 00:07:50,100
- I don't think that's too fun.

125
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,303
- Neither do I but you can't
take life too seriously, right?

126
00:07:53,303 --> 00:07:55,140
- I'm no expert but I think

127
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,450
if you want anything in this life

128
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,232
you've gotta take yourself seriously

129
00:07:58,232 --> 00:07:59,899
or nobody else will.

130
00:08:04,315 --> 00:08:07,369
- I'm so hungry I could eat a mountaintop.

131
00:08:07,369 --> 00:08:08,762
But an actress doesn't work regular,

132
00:08:08,762 --> 00:08:10,361
she doesn't eat regular.

133
00:08:10,361 --> 00:08:11,982
- Writers have the same problem.

134
00:08:11,982 --> 00:08:14,236
- You know, you're the first real writer

135
00:08:14,236 --> 00:08:15,958
I've ever gone out with.

136
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,852
- Well I wouldn't call
writing celebrity stories

137
00:08:17,852 --> 00:08:18,698
being a real writer.

138
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,937
- What do you want to write?

139
00:08:20,937 --> 00:08:22,317
- Movies, mostly.

140
00:08:22,317 --> 00:08:24,206
I've been working on a script for months

141
00:08:24,206 --> 00:08:26,137
that I just can't seem to finish.

142
00:08:26,137 --> 00:08:28,461
I sit down every night and
I look at my typewriter and.

143
00:08:28,461 --> 00:08:29,544
Laughs at me.

144
00:08:31,173 --> 00:08:32,312
- Don't worry.

145
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:34,383
You'll finish your script soon.

146
00:08:34,383 --> 00:08:36,875
I have faith in you.

147
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:40,040
Besides, you look like you're doing okay.

148
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:44,779
- Well I don't want to kid
you, the suit's borrowed.

149
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:46,897
Have you done much acting?

150
00:08:46,897 --> 00:08:49,255
- Back to my resume?

151
00:08:49,255 --> 00:08:51,877
- That's what I'm here for, isn't it?

152
00:08:51,877 --> 00:08:53,595
- I thought you were here
because you liked me?

153
00:08:53,595 --> 00:08:55,529
- Of course I like you.

154
00:08:55,529 --> 00:08:56,362
- Good.

155
00:08:57,891 --> 00:08:59,141
I like you too.

156
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,849
- You're being very sweet about this.

157
00:09:05,849 --> 00:09:09,435
Beautiful girls like you don't
usually go for guys like me.

158
00:09:09,435 --> 00:09:10,268
- Why not?

159
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:18,847
- Well I mean I'm not as
handsome as some guys.

160
00:09:20,241 --> 00:09:21,074
- Come on.

161
00:09:21,984 --> 00:09:24,992
- Hey, I thought you were hungry?

162
00:09:24,992 --> 00:09:25,825
- Come on.

163
00:09:30,966 --> 00:09:32,805
Don't worry so much.

164
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:35,007
You can always get another steak.

165
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:37,178
But a moon like that.

166
00:09:37,178 --> 00:09:40,428
- Yeah, only comes up once every night.

167
00:09:41,693 --> 00:09:43,884
- No, it'll never be the same.

168
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:45,830
Tomorrow it'll be different.

169
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,377
- Why?

170
00:09:47,377 --> 00:09:48,960
- We won't be here.

171
00:09:49,938 --> 00:09:51,907
- We could come back.

172
00:09:51,907 --> 00:09:53,470
- But then we'd be different.

173
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,303
- How so?

174
00:09:55,497 --> 00:09:59,080
- After tonight, we'll
always be different.

175
00:10:00,047 --> 00:10:02,916
- You always say the first
thing that pops into your head?

176
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:06,026
- My husband used to ask
me the same question.

177
00:10:06,026 --> 00:10:07,926
- You've been married?

178
00:10:07,926 --> 00:10:09,343
- We're divorced.

179
00:10:10,283 --> 00:10:12,748
Jimmy was a nice boy, really sweet.

180
00:10:12,748 --> 00:10:14,581
But we were too young.

181
00:10:16,638 --> 00:10:18,531
I think my father had a concession stand

182
00:10:18,531 --> 00:10:20,281
down there somewhere.

183
00:10:24,477 --> 00:10:26,276
- You don't know?

184
00:10:26,276 --> 00:10:29,015
- I never really met him.

185
00:10:29,015 --> 00:10:32,496
He left the night before I was born.

186
00:10:32,496 --> 00:10:34,500
Mom and me, we moved around some.

187
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,213
Sometimes I had to live in foster homes.

188
00:10:38,213 --> 00:10:39,839
But when mama was cutting films,

189
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:40,899
we got to be together.

190
00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:42,297
- Well maybe I know her.

191
00:10:42,297 --> 00:10:44,865
Where's she working these days?

192
00:10:44,865 --> 00:10:46,503
- Remember what I said.

193
00:10:46,503 --> 00:10:50,055
I said we'd be different after tonight.

194
00:10:50,055 --> 00:10:52,722
- How are we gonna be different?

195
00:10:54,497 --> 00:10:55,997
- Can't you guess?

196
00:11:02,056 --> 00:11:04,556
(sultry jazz)

197
00:11:22,514 --> 00:11:24,736
- Norma Jean, this is a public beach.

198
00:11:24,736 --> 00:11:26,003
- Relax Ibsen.

199
00:11:26,003 --> 00:11:27,420
- My name is Bob.

200
00:11:39,994 --> 00:11:41,169
- [Norma] Come on in, Bob.

201
00:11:41,169 --> 00:11:42,502
Don't be afraid.

202
00:11:43,365 --> 00:11:44,427
C'mon!

203
00:11:44,427 --> 00:11:47,007
You know how to get undressed don't you?

204
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:49,092
- Norma Jean, I don't
know if I can do this.

205
00:11:49,092 --> 00:11:52,953
- [Norma] If you don't,
you'll always be sorry.

206
00:11:52,953 --> 00:11:53,786
Come on, Bobby.

207
00:11:53,786 --> 00:11:55,786
Do it once, just for me.

208
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:12,436
- [Bob] Incredible, isn't it?

209
00:12:12,436 --> 00:12:14,342
But I swear it's true.

210
00:12:14,342 --> 00:12:17,086
That was my first date with Norma Jean.

211
00:12:17,086 --> 00:12:18,760
Of course I didn't want it to end but,

212
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,510
sooner or later, everything ends.

213
00:12:32,103 --> 00:12:34,274
You want me to leave you here?

214
00:12:34,274 --> 00:12:36,359
- I live with my aunt over there.

215
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:38,296
She gets upset when I'm out late.

216
00:12:38,296 --> 00:12:41,129
I don't want her to hear your car.

217
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:54,865
- Well, if you need me, I'm staying

218
00:12:54,865 --> 00:12:57,364
at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel.

219
00:12:57,364 --> 00:12:58,254
You can call me any time you want.

220
00:12:58,254 --> 00:12:59,337
Day or night.

221
00:13:16,848 --> 00:13:18,103
- Always a gentleman?

222
00:13:18,103 --> 00:13:18,936
- Try.

223
00:13:20,764 --> 00:13:24,847
- Better warn you. I may
not see you for a while.

224
00:13:25,915 --> 00:13:28,250
My moods can change pretty fast.

225
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,583
I may not like you tomorrow.

226
00:13:32,121 --> 00:13:34,954
- Well then thank you for tonight.

227
00:13:42,754 --> 00:13:46,337
- Then again, tomorrow
maybe I'll love you.

228
00:13:53,805 --> 00:13:55,358
- [Aunt Dana] This is no hour

229
00:13:55,358 --> 00:13:57,555
for a young lady to be coming home.

230
00:13:57,555 --> 00:13:59,797
Forgive me child, I'm old.

231
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,602
I need my peace.

232
00:14:01,602 --> 00:14:04,398
Now you can go stay at a hotel tonight.

233
00:14:04,398 --> 00:14:06,824
In the morning you can go
find a place of your own.

234
00:14:06,824 --> 00:14:08,657
If you need any money,

235
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:15,517
you know I love you, like you were my own.

236
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:18,518
- I know, Aunt Dana.

237
00:14:18,518 --> 00:14:20,576
Everyone loves me.

238
00:14:20,576 --> 00:14:23,743
Sooner or later everyone says goodbye.

239
00:14:35,492 --> 00:14:37,742
(knocking)

240
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:50,923
I betcha thought you
wouldn't see me again.

241
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:53,256
At least not this soon, huh?

242
00:15:21,126 --> 00:15:24,029
- [Bob] It was like one of
those storybook moments,

243
00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:25,612
except it was real.

244
00:15:26,686 --> 00:15:30,418
Suddenly I felt like the
luckiest guy in the world.

245
00:15:30,418 --> 00:15:33,144
But life has a way of making
you pay for every break

246
00:15:33,144 --> 00:15:34,908
and it would be long before I found out

247
00:15:34,908 --> 00:15:37,241
how high the price could be.

248
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:18,316
- Hi.

249
00:16:18,316 --> 00:16:19,149
- Hello.

250
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:25,208
- I think I dreamed about you.

251
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:28,023
But I can't remember much.

252
00:16:28,023 --> 00:16:31,690
Isn't it awful we don't
remember our dreams?

253
00:16:32,688 --> 00:16:35,438
- I think I'm dreaming right now.

254
00:16:36,936 --> 00:16:37,853
- So sweet.

255
00:16:40,526 --> 00:16:42,837
You're very unusual for a man.

256
00:16:42,837 --> 00:16:45,337
At least the one's I've known.

257
00:16:48,433 --> 00:16:49,266
- Say.

258
00:16:50,112 --> 00:16:54,057
I don't have to be any
place in particular today.

259
00:16:54,057 --> 00:16:58,254
One of the few benefits of
being a starving writer.

260
00:16:58,254 --> 00:17:01,898
What do you say we spend
the day right here.

261
00:17:01,898 --> 00:17:04,565
I could order up some breakfast.

262
00:17:05,494 --> 00:17:06,411
- Oh, sure.

263
00:17:07,843 --> 00:17:09,802
And let some other girl get the part

264
00:17:09,802 --> 00:17:12,143
that could be my lucky break?

265
00:17:12,143 --> 00:17:15,226
Besides, I have to find an apartment.

266
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:18,485
- I mean, not necessarily.

267
00:17:19,642 --> 00:17:22,573
We could look for an apartment.

268
00:17:22,573 --> 00:17:25,200
Think about it, two can
live cheaper than one.

269
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,438
- And is this strictly
a business proposition?

270
00:17:28,438 --> 00:17:31,021
- Well, let me put it this way.

271
00:17:33,942 --> 00:17:34,775
No.

272
00:17:41,565 --> 00:17:43,201
Over easy?

273
00:17:43,201 --> 00:17:44,034
- Sure.

274
00:17:46,326 --> 00:17:49,889
- [Bob] We agreed to take
things one rent check at a time.

275
00:17:49,889 --> 00:17:52,215
I finished the last interviews
for my paper in Ohio

276
00:17:52,215 --> 00:17:54,465
and kissed the job goodbye.

277
00:17:55,349 --> 00:17:56,286
I'd saved enough to rent

278
00:17:56,286 --> 00:17:58,189
an apartment in the Hollywood hills.

279
00:17:58,189 --> 00:18:01,247
Norma Jean kicked in what she could.

280
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,547
It was time for me to write and

281
00:18:02,547 --> 00:18:04,022
for her to make it as an actress.

282
00:18:04,022 --> 00:18:06,689
(Norma singing)

283
00:18:13,902 --> 00:18:17,127
♪ You must realize ♪

284
00:18:17,127 --> 00:18:20,946
♪ Smoke gets in your eyes ♪

285
00:18:20,946 --> 00:18:23,466
(clapping)

286
00:18:23,466 --> 00:18:25,604
- You've got a pretty good voice.

287
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,298
- I like to sing.

288
00:18:27,298 --> 00:18:30,476
I don't get the chance very often.

289
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:32,809
Mama always sang when she worked.

290
00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:35,059
I think I've got her voice.

291
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:40,038
She didn't give me much
else before she went away,

292
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:42,560
except these jelly glasses.

293
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,810
Isn't that sad.

294
00:18:50,075 --> 00:18:51,031
- [Bob] Where is she now?

295
00:18:51,031 --> 00:18:51,948
- Up north.

296
00:18:52,838 --> 00:18:54,455
In the hospital.

297
00:18:54,455 --> 00:18:56,205
Kind of a sanitarium.

298
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,950
But one day soon, she's gonna get better.

299
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:02,418
Then maybe she can come visit us.

300
00:19:02,418 --> 00:19:05,085
- Yeah, that'd be great with me.

301
00:19:10,722 --> 00:19:12,572
An old boyfriend?

302
00:19:12,572 --> 00:19:13,405
- Jealous?

303
00:19:15,944 --> 00:19:16,777
- Guilty.

304
00:19:17,849 --> 00:19:19,659
- They're from my father.

305
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:22,237
- I'm sorry, I didn't meant to pry.

306
00:19:22,237 --> 00:19:25,027
- He sent them to mama before he died.

307
00:19:25,027 --> 00:19:28,193
Mama said it was a motorcycle accident.

308
00:19:28,193 --> 00:19:31,974
It's all I have left to remember him by.

309
00:19:31,974 --> 00:19:33,391
Just these cards.

310
00:19:34,934 --> 00:19:37,108
That's my family.

311
00:19:37,108 --> 00:19:40,775
A couple of postcards
and six jelly glasses.

312
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,213
- Hey.

313
00:19:44,277 --> 00:19:47,981
I've got two, three
extra dollars to splurge.

314
00:19:47,981 --> 00:19:49,242
What'll it be?

315
00:19:49,242 --> 00:19:51,075
Serials or el macabre?

316
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:54,206
- I think I can do better.

317
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,701
- I don't know if I belong here.

318
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:04,551
- Neither of us belongs
here, but we'll get by.

319
00:20:04,551 --> 00:20:07,968
Besides, this is business for both of us.

320
00:20:09,671 --> 00:20:10,504
I see my agent.

321
00:20:10,504 --> 00:20:12,013
He's been ducking me for two days.

322
00:20:12,013 --> 00:20:12,846
See you later.

323
00:20:12,846 --> 00:20:14,096
And Bobby, mix.

324
00:20:22,244 --> 00:20:23,646
- Hey bub, my name's Walter Winchell.

325
00:20:23,646 --> 00:20:26,019
You mind if I ask who's the dish?

326
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:28,245
- My name's Bob Slatzer.

327
00:20:28,245 --> 00:20:29,246
- Nice to meet you, Bob.

328
00:20:29,246 --> 00:20:31,650
I don't mean to be rude, but
they pay me to ask questions.

329
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:32,760
- Her name's Norma Jean Baker.

330
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,993
She's an actress.

331
00:20:33,993 --> 00:20:34,826
- Hi.

332
00:20:35,955 --> 00:20:36,788
- And you?

333
00:20:36,788 --> 00:20:37,808
You're her?

334
00:20:37,808 --> 00:20:38,902
- Friend.

335
00:20:38,902 --> 00:20:40,402
I'm also a writer.

336
00:20:42,384 --> 00:20:43,453
Undiscovered at the moment.

337
00:20:43,453 --> 00:20:45,409
- Well you may not be
the most famous guy here,

338
00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:47,077
but there isn't a joker in the joint

339
00:20:47,077 --> 00:20:49,673
wouldn't trade places with you today.

340
00:20:49,673 --> 00:20:50,506
Good luck, Bob.

341
00:20:50,506 --> 00:20:51,339
- Thanks.

342
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,070
- I called you twice.

343
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,451
I guess you've been busy, huh?

344
00:20:55,451 --> 00:20:56,967
- I'm sorry I didn't get back to you

345
00:20:56,967 --> 00:20:59,017
but the truth is I don't
have any news for you.

346
00:20:59,017 --> 00:21:01,054
- Come on, Harry, what did he say?

347
00:21:01,054 --> 00:21:03,400
- He's not so sure you're photogenic.

348
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,322
- Not photogenic?

349
00:21:04,322 --> 00:21:05,874
Has Zanuck gone blind?

350
00:21:05,874 --> 00:21:08,085
- Shh, take it easy,
I'm still working on it.

351
00:21:08,085 --> 00:21:10,709
We'll get you that screen
test one of these days,

352
00:21:10,709 --> 00:21:12,288
but you've gotta help.

353
00:21:12,288 --> 00:21:14,206
Zanuck, Schenck, Jack Warner.

354
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:16,830
These men are your future, so act like it.

355
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:17,663
- How?

356
00:21:17,663 --> 00:21:19,256
- You've got to be nice to them.

357
00:21:19,256 --> 00:21:20,235
- How nice?

358
00:21:20,235 --> 00:21:21,068
- Very nice.

359
00:21:21,068 --> 00:21:21,901
- Very nice.

360
00:21:21,901 --> 00:21:23,077
- Very nice.

361
00:21:23,077 --> 00:21:24,425
- And to Mr. Zanuck?

362
00:21:24,425 --> 00:21:26,077
- Extra, extra nice.

363
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:31,020
- And is Jack Warner a extra,
extra or just a very, very?

364
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,375
- And while we're on the subject,

365
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,413
if you're gonna crash a party,

366
00:21:33,413 --> 00:21:34,509
the least you could do is look available.

367
00:21:34,509 --> 00:21:36,516
Who's the kid you walked in with?

368
00:21:36,516 --> 00:21:38,249
- [Norma] He's a writer.

369
00:21:38,249 --> 00:21:39,082
- Stay away from writers.

370
00:21:39,082 --> 00:21:39,915
They're all nuts.

371
00:21:39,915 --> 00:21:41,003
Besides, he's a nobody.

372
00:21:41,003 --> 00:21:41,836
He can't do you any good.

373
00:21:41,836 --> 00:21:43,454
- Oh yes he can.

374
00:21:43,454 --> 00:21:45,554
- Look, I don't care what
you do between the sheets,

375
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,527
wait a minute.

376
00:21:47,527 --> 00:21:50,639
Good God, you don't love him, do you?

377
00:21:50,639 --> 00:21:51,472
- I might, Harry.

378
00:21:51,472 --> 00:21:52,844
I just might.

379
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:53,977
- Don't be foolish.

380
00:21:53,977 --> 00:21:55,116
You've got no time for this.

381
00:21:55,116 --> 00:21:56,533
Kill the romance.

382
00:21:58,370 --> 00:21:59,553
- Bobby.

383
00:21:59,553 --> 00:22:00,386
Bobby.

384
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:05,232
- Your agent wants me to go doesn't he?

385
00:22:05,232 --> 00:22:06,858
- You're pretty smart.

386
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:09,629
- Look, why don't I leave.

387
00:22:09,629 --> 00:22:11,155
You can get a lift home.

388
00:22:11,155 --> 00:22:12,097
- No.

389
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:13,177
You stay.

390
00:22:13,177 --> 00:22:17,094
They aren't gonna tell
me what to do, not ever.

391
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:19,762
Come on.

392
00:22:19,762 --> 00:22:21,698
They're screening a Gene
Harlow movie inside.

393
00:22:21,698 --> 00:22:22,948
Lets go see it.

394
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,065
- It wouldn't have sounded
better than an alarm clock.

395
00:22:28,065 --> 00:22:31,648
It doesn't seem to ring
or anything at all.

396
00:22:42,145 --> 00:22:44,412
Billy, have you got a headache?

397
00:22:44,412 --> 00:22:47,076
- [Billy] Maybe. I don't know.

398
00:22:47,076 --> 00:22:48,722
- Would you like me to rub your forehead?

399
00:22:48,722 --> 00:22:49,805
- [Billy] Nope.

400
00:22:49,805 --> 00:22:52,860
- [Woman In Film] Well could I
get you a drink or something?

401
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,610
- [Billy] No, thank you, darling.

402
00:23:00,383 --> 00:23:03,008
- Well lets forget about the drink.

403
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:06,591
I'll just rub your
forehead with sandpaper.

404
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:14,888
- [Bob] When are you coming to bed?

405
00:23:14,888 --> 00:23:16,614
- [Norma] In a minute.

406
00:23:16,614 --> 00:23:18,864
I'm not quite finished yet.

407
00:23:21,295 --> 00:23:22,128
- [Bob] Ooh boy.

408
00:23:22,128 --> 00:23:23,461
- Whaddya think?

409
00:23:26,497 --> 00:23:27,991
My mama taught me.

410
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:29,908
She was good with hair.

411
00:23:30,973 --> 00:23:34,890
I bet this'll make them
sit up and take notice.

412
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,605
- You'll try just about
anything, won't you?

413
00:23:42,605 --> 00:23:45,007
- So long as it's legal.

414
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:47,701
I just wish I had money to study.

415
00:23:47,701 --> 00:23:48,826
- You need acting lessons?

416
00:23:48,826 --> 00:23:49,659
Okay.

417
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,232
- What?

418
00:23:52,232 --> 00:23:53,065
- I'll take that waiter's job

419
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:54,973
at Clifton's on the night shift.

420
00:23:54,973 --> 00:23:56,814
- You'd do that for me?

421
00:23:56,814 --> 00:23:58,193
You'd stop writing?

422
00:23:58,193 --> 00:24:00,183
- I'm not spending a lot of time

423
00:24:00,183 --> 00:24:01,445
in front of the typewriter anyway.

424
00:24:01,445 --> 00:24:04,195
(Norma laughing)

425
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:38,987
- But Zanuck still doesn't
think I'm photogenic.

426
00:24:38,987 --> 00:24:42,198
I'm good for nygard, he
said, but not as an actress.

427
00:24:42,198 --> 00:24:44,465
Harry can't even get me a bit part.

428
00:24:44,465 --> 00:24:46,424
- Well you still manage.

429
00:24:46,424 --> 00:24:47,736
- Sure.

430
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,461
Some producer wants to go

431
00:24:49,461 --> 00:24:50,792
to a premiere with a young actress?

432
00:24:50,792 --> 00:24:52,369
Send for Norma Jean.

433
00:24:52,369 --> 00:24:53,927
Need somebody to jump out of a cake?

434
00:24:53,927 --> 00:24:55,594
Send for Norma Jean.

435
00:24:56,492 --> 00:24:59,192
I'm sorry you wasted your
money on a wind-up toy.

436
00:24:59,192 --> 00:25:01,253
- You are not a wind-up toy.

437
00:25:01,253 --> 00:25:03,453
- Then when do I get a chance to act?

438
00:25:03,453 --> 00:25:04,586
- Well, you keep trying.

439
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,419
That's all you can do.

440
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:11,367
You know, this television
thing is amazing.

441
00:25:11,367 --> 00:25:13,471
Maybe this is the future.

442
00:25:13,471 --> 00:25:14,930
- Too small.

443
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:19,097
I want to be 40 feet tall
with a teardrop 10 feet wide.

444
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:23,257
- Don't worry, you'll
get there Norma Jean.

445
00:25:23,257 --> 00:25:26,674
Might take a while, but you'll get there.

446
00:25:28,123 --> 00:25:30,956
(engine stalling)

447
00:25:34,203 --> 00:25:38,348
Course it might take a
little longer without a car.

448
00:25:38,348 --> 00:25:41,499
Nice streak of luck we're having, huh?

449
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:44,863
- Well actually there is a job for me.

450
00:25:44,863 --> 00:25:46,950
I met a photographer, Tom Kelly.

451
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,639
Well known, respectable.

452
00:25:48,639 --> 00:25:50,516
He asked me to do a calendar.

453
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:51,849
- You mean nude?

454
00:25:53,113 --> 00:25:54,969
- It's just another calendar.

455
00:25:54,969 --> 00:25:55,973
There's a million of them out there

456
00:25:55,973 --> 00:25:57,930
and a million nude models.

457
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:00,185
We need the money.

458
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:01,151
- I don't know.

459
00:26:01,151 --> 00:26:02,839
Greasy paws hanging you up in gas stations

460
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:04,562
all over the country?

461
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:06,836
- Bobby, it's just business.

462
00:26:06,836 --> 00:26:08,558
What do we care who looks?

463
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:11,725
You're the only one who gets to touch.

464
00:26:12,629 --> 00:26:13,600
Would it make you feel better

465
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,985
if you went to the photo session with me?

466
00:26:14,985 --> 00:26:17,212
Make sure everything's on the square?

467
00:26:17,212 --> 00:26:18,152
- Maybe.

468
00:26:18,152 --> 00:26:19,604
- Tell you what, if you don't

469
00:26:19,604 --> 00:26:21,595
like the looks of Mr. Tom Kelly,

470
00:26:21,595 --> 00:26:23,012
I'll call it off.

471
00:26:26,187 --> 00:26:30,085
- Well he seems like a very nice man.

472
00:26:30,085 --> 00:26:32,246
Got to admit, I like his work.

473
00:26:32,246 --> 00:26:33,746
- See, told ya so.

474
00:26:35,124 --> 00:26:36,862
- You sure you want to do this?

475
00:26:36,862 --> 00:26:37,805
- We're broke and without a car,

476
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:40,722
that's no way to live in Hollywood.

477
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:48,195
- You're welcome to stay for
a little while, Mr. Slatzer,

478
00:26:48,195 --> 00:26:50,375
but then I'm going to
have to ask you to leave.

479
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:51,814
Models do better when there
are no friends or family

480
00:26:51,814 --> 00:26:54,315
around to make them feel self-conscious.

481
00:26:54,315 --> 00:26:55,148
You understand.

482
00:26:55,148 --> 00:26:55,981
- Yeah, yeah sure.

483
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:57,673
I'll just stay a while

484
00:26:57,673 --> 00:27:00,955
if you don't want anybody
to be uncomfortable.

485
00:27:00,955 --> 00:27:01,788
- Okay.

486
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:04,651
Just the way we talked about, right?

487
00:27:04,651 --> 00:27:06,439
Want you to stretch out.

488
00:27:06,439 --> 00:27:07,522
That's right.

489
00:27:08,923 --> 00:27:12,428
Just want you to feel that velvet, okay?

490
00:27:12,428 --> 00:27:13,947
That's it.

491
00:27:13,947 --> 00:27:16,694
Stretch out as far as you can.

492
00:27:16,694 --> 00:27:17,527
That's it.

493
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,583
Okay, floating, right?

494
00:27:23,886 --> 00:27:24,719
Floating.

495
00:27:29,239 --> 00:27:32,122
- Can you feel it, Bobby?

496
00:27:32,122 --> 00:27:33,702
- Feel what?

497
00:27:33,702 --> 00:27:36,452
- Our luck is starting to change.

498
00:27:38,467 --> 00:27:40,534
- Can you believe this?

499
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:41,942
Yes, yes, really nice.

500
00:27:41,942 --> 00:27:43,025
Keep turning.

501
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,245
- [Mechanic] Yeah, hold on a second.

502
00:28:04,245 --> 00:28:07,078
Hey Slatzer, you got a phone call.

503
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:14,973
- Y'ello?

504
00:28:14,973 --> 00:28:17,116
- [Norma] Bobby, Fox wants me.

505
00:28:17,116 --> 00:28:18,929
I'm signing the contract today.

506
00:28:18,929 --> 00:28:21,019
- Hey, that's great!

507
00:28:21,019 --> 00:28:24,007
Listen, I get off in a couple
hours, you want to celebrate?

508
00:28:24,007 --> 00:28:24,886
- [Norma] I can't wait.

509
00:28:24,886 --> 00:28:25,719
See ya.

510
00:28:28,961 --> 00:28:30,207
- Damn.

511
00:28:30,207 --> 00:28:31,874
She actually did it.

512
00:28:37,829 --> 00:28:39,606
- It's a standard studio contract.

513
00:28:39,606 --> 00:28:42,356
One year with at least one
speaking part, guaranteed.

514
00:28:42,356 --> 00:28:43,439
- Where do I sign.

515
00:28:43,439 --> 00:28:45,863
- Well I think you should
read everything first.

516
00:28:45,863 --> 00:28:46,952
Carefully.

517
00:28:46,952 --> 00:28:48,089
- Come on, Chuck.

518
00:28:48,089 --> 00:28:50,918
Usual boilerplate, isn't it?

519
00:28:50,918 --> 00:28:55,085
- Yes, Harry, but we know
she has a boyfriend at home.

520
00:28:56,946 --> 00:28:58,464
- Bobby.

521
00:28:58,464 --> 00:29:00,369
What does Bobby have to do with this?

522
00:29:00,369 --> 00:29:01,553
- Well it's in your contract.

523
00:29:01,553 --> 00:29:02,636
Paragraph 17.

524
00:29:05,156 --> 00:29:06,450
- [Harry] Sorry, Norma Jean.

525
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:07,408
- Sorry?

526
00:29:07,408 --> 00:29:08,241
Why?

527
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:11,316
What's in paragraph 17?

528
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:15,544
- And then what?

529
00:29:15,544 --> 00:29:17,758
- So they said, "Norma Jean Baker

530
00:29:17,758 --> 00:29:20,513
sounds like some freckle-faced
kid from Kansas."

531
00:29:20,513 --> 00:29:23,680
They said, "How 'bout Marilyn Monroe?"

532
00:29:29,964 --> 00:29:31,381
- Marilyn Monroe?

533
00:29:33,977 --> 00:29:36,388
Sounds kinda slinky to me.

534
00:29:36,388 --> 00:29:37,999
- He said live with it for a few days.

535
00:29:37,999 --> 00:29:41,204
If I don't like it, they'll
come up with something else.

536
00:29:41,204 --> 00:29:42,131
But I have to let them know so they can

537
00:29:42,131 --> 00:29:43,541
put it out in a press release.

538
00:29:43,541 --> 00:29:46,224
- Well I still prefer Norma Jean.

539
00:29:46,224 --> 00:29:48,224
- You know what you are?

540
00:29:49,226 --> 00:29:52,393
You're just a big romantic teddy bear.

541
00:29:53,437 --> 00:29:55,192
This could be good for you too.

542
00:29:55,192 --> 00:29:56,235
Who knows.

543
00:29:56,235 --> 00:29:58,050
Maybe I'll be able to get some producer

544
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:00,178
to look at one of your scripts.

545
00:30:00,178 --> 00:30:02,836
- Yeah, maybe you can.

546
00:30:02,836 --> 00:30:04,503
Oh, I almost forgot.

547
00:30:05,999 --> 00:30:10,166
I got you something to
celebrate signing your contract.

548
00:30:13,254 --> 00:30:15,308
A dozen white roses.

549
00:30:15,308 --> 00:30:17,308
Kissed twice by the sun.

550
00:30:20,954 --> 00:30:23,371
- Oh, Bob, they're beautiful.

551
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:29,766
But I have to tell you something.

552
00:30:29,766 --> 00:30:30,599
- What?

553
00:30:34,643 --> 00:30:36,893
- I would have to move out.

554
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:41,303
- Oh.

555
00:30:43,435 --> 00:30:45,199
Yeah, I get it.

556
00:30:45,199 --> 00:30:47,016
- [Norma] You do?

557
00:30:47,016 --> 00:30:47,849
- Yeah.

558
00:30:48,967 --> 00:30:53,557
Can't have a guy like me
around messing up publicity.

559
00:30:53,557 --> 00:30:55,128
- That's nonsense.

560
00:30:55,128 --> 00:30:57,215
This isn't my idea.

561
00:30:57,215 --> 00:31:00,154
It's the morality clause in my contract.

562
00:31:00,154 --> 00:31:04,730
They're putting me up in a
woman's hotel, for heaven's sake.

563
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,475
- Is that what you want?

564
00:31:06,475 --> 00:31:09,058
- This isn't about what I want.

565
00:31:10,484 --> 00:31:13,151
Bobby, please try to understand.

566
00:31:14,945 --> 00:31:17,865
I can't remember a day in my life

567
00:31:17,865 --> 00:31:21,532
when I wanted to be
anything but an actress.

568
00:31:23,471 --> 00:31:25,471
I don't know what it is.

569
00:31:26,971 --> 00:31:29,804
But when I'm acting, I feel alive.

570
00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:37,059
- Well I'm glad you feel
alive, I feel like hell.

571
00:31:37,059 --> 00:31:40,433
- Bobby, I can't let
this chance pass me by.

572
00:31:40,433 --> 00:31:42,496
It's still my life.

573
00:31:42,496 --> 00:31:43,750
It's still us.

574
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:44,583
- No.

575
00:31:47,099 --> 00:31:49,432
No, it's you and the studio.

576
00:31:51,545 --> 00:31:52,615
Come on.

577
00:31:52,615 --> 00:31:54,444
I'll help you pack.

578
00:31:54,444 --> 00:31:56,611
We can get this over with.

579
00:32:06,001 --> 00:32:09,096
[Bob] After Norma Jean
left, we drifted apart.

580
00:32:09,096 --> 00:32:11,578
She changed studios from Fox to Columbia

581
00:32:11,578 --> 00:32:14,671
and started to get more parts.

582
00:32:14,671 --> 00:32:18,061
I had some assignments
but nothing clicked.

583
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:21,073
So it was back to Ohio for me.

584
00:32:21,073 --> 00:32:24,020
Back to my old newspaper job.

585
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,446
A chance to forget Hollywood

586
00:32:25,446 --> 00:32:28,279
and a girl that was unforgettable.

(applause)

599
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:26,169
(phone ringing)

600
00:33:28,218 --> 00:33:29,074
- Slatzer.

601
00:33:29,074 --> 00:33:33,241
- [Norma] Hello Bobby, it's
your Hollywood Gazette.

602
00:33:39,062 --> 00:33:40,909
(phone ringing)

603
00:33:40,909 --> 00:33:41,742
- Y'ello?

604
00:33:42,697 --> 00:33:44,317
- [Norma] Bobby, I think we got cut off.

605
00:33:44,317 --> 00:33:45,915
- No, we didn't.

606
00:33:45,915 --> 00:33:47,370
- Don't you wanna talk to me?

607
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:49,020
- It cost too much.

608
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:49,853
- Why?

609
00:33:49,853 --> 00:33:51,103
It's my nickel.

610
00:33:53,433 --> 00:33:54,915
- What do you want, Norma Jean?

611
00:33:54,915 --> 00:33:57,289
- Come on, ask me how I am.

612
00:33:57,289 --> 00:33:58,956
- Okay, how are you?

613
00:34:00,017 --> 00:34:00,943
- I'm working.

614
00:34:00,943 --> 00:34:03,128
I'm singing in a movie here at Columbia.

615
00:34:03,128 --> 00:34:04,094
Isn't that terrific?

616
00:34:04,094 --> 00:34:05,844
- [Bob] That's great.

617
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:07,887
- And guess what.

618
00:34:07,887 --> 00:34:09,732
Harry Cohn invited me to a big party.

619
00:34:09,732 --> 00:34:11,899
Come back, be my escort.

620
00:34:11,899 --> 00:34:13,066
- Don't start.

621
00:34:14,125 --> 00:34:16,378
We have this same argument
every time you call.

622
00:34:16,378 --> 00:34:17,579
- Then don't argue.

623
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:19,455
Maybe things will be different this time.

624
00:34:19,455 --> 00:34:21,939
- [Bob] Different how?

625
00:34:21,939 --> 00:34:22,783
- I don't know.

626
00:34:22,783 --> 00:34:23,840
Why do you always have to know

627
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,625
how everything's going to turn out?

628
00:34:25,625 --> 00:34:27,382
- Writers are funny that way.

629
00:34:27,382 --> 00:34:29,102
- Well then I'm sorry I asked.

630
00:34:29,102 --> 00:34:32,269
But don't worry, I'll never ask again.

631
00:34:42,095 --> 00:34:43,792
- Thank you, Monroe.

632
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:46,230
- I thought you said we were
going to a party, Mr. Cohn.

633
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,625
- We are a party, now get back here.

634
00:34:48,625 --> 00:34:50,039
If you don't come here right now

635
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:52,443
you're gonna have to walk all
the way back to Hollywood.

636
00:34:52,443 --> 00:34:54,888
- That's okay, Mr. Cohn,
I was born in Hollywood.

637
00:34:54,888 --> 00:34:56,138
I know the way.

638
00:35:01,093 --> 00:35:03,708
- [Harry] Well, you've
really done it this time.

639
00:35:03,708 --> 00:35:05,314
- Columbia's going to dump me.

640
00:35:05,314 --> 00:35:06,933
- Sure looks that way.

641
00:35:06,933 --> 00:35:08,397
Fox, now Columbia.

642
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:09,367
Congratulations.

643
00:35:09,367 --> 00:35:11,596
- Harry, I can sing.

644
00:35:11,596 --> 00:35:14,843
I did that number last
week and I was really good.

645
00:35:14,843 --> 00:35:16,234
Even the crew applauded.

646
00:35:16,234 --> 00:35:17,264
- Who cares?

647
00:35:17,264 --> 00:35:18,896
- I care.

648
00:35:18,896 --> 00:35:19,729
- Sorry.

649
00:35:19,729 --> 00:35:22,039
See how much you upset me?

650
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:24,277
Of course you have talent, I know that.

651
00:35:24,277 --> 00:35:26,367
But this business is about people.

652
00:35:26,367 --> 00:35:29,119
You can't treat people badly
and expect them to help you.

653
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:30,609
I'm gonna call Harry Cohn.

654
00:35:30,609 --> 00:35:32,239
Now what should I tell him?

655
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:35,610
Just be nice to him, kiddo, you can do it.

656
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:37,827
It's in your hands, Marilyn.

657
00:35:37,827 --> 00:35:39,507
What should I tell him.

658
00:35:39,507 --> 00:35:43,674
- Tell him I'm thinking
about getting a new agent.

659
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,907
(phone ringing)

660
00:35:58,073 --> 00:35:58,906
- Slatzer.

661
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:02,358
- [Norma] Come home for
the holidays, Bobby.

662
00:36:02,358 --> 00:36:04,001
I don't want to be alone.

663
00:36:04,001 --> 00:36:07,001
- And I'm the only one you can call?

664
00:36:07,993 --> 00:36:10,085
- [Norma] You're the only
one who's never let me down.

665
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:12,455
- So what does that make
me, Norma Jean, your pal?

666
00:36:12,455 --> 00:36:15,068
Sorry, that's not enough.

667
00:36:15,068 --> 00:36:17,017
- [Norma] Columbia dropped me.

668
00:36:17,017 --> 00:36:18,784
No studio contracts.

669
00:36:18,784 --> 00:36:21,385
No morals clause to keep us apart.

670
00:36:21,385 --> 00:36:23,250
Besides, what's so immoral about

671
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:26,185
making love with someone you love?

672
00:36:26,185 --> 00:36:29,260
- What happens when you
get another contract?

673
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,093
- [Norma] We'll cheat.

674
00:36:32,879 --> 00:36:34,595
- Do you mean that?

675
00:36:34,595 --> 00:36:35,885
- [Norma] Of course I do.

676
00:36:35,885 --> 00:36:39,994
Aren't you tired of working
for that silly old newspaper?

677
00:36:39,994 --> 00:36:42,494
- Well, all things considered,

678
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:45,687
I'd rather be making westerns.

679
00:36:45,687 --> 00:36:49,332
- [Norma] Do it, Bobby, come back.

680
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:50,165
- Alright.

681
00:36:51,372 --> 00:36:52,608
I'll be there at Christmas.

682
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:55,804
But we are gonna have a talk, alright?

683
00:36:55,804 --> 00:36:57,583
- [Norma] Let me know when you're arriving

684
00:36:57,583 --> 00:36:58,935
and I'll pick you up.

685
00:36:58,935 --> 00:37:01,537
Oh, Bobby, it's going to be
wonderful having you here again.

686
00:37:01,537 --> 00:37:02,483
Bye.

687
00:37:02,483 --> 00:37:04,816
(dial tone)

688
00:37:16,371 --> 00:37:18,093
- This is Valentino's house.

689
00:37:18,093 --> 00:37:20,477
The radio said they're
gonna tear it down tomorrow.

690
00:37:20,477 --> 00:37:24,644
I thought we should look
around once before it's gone.

691
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:30,877
- You know, you're the best
drinking buddy I ever had.

692
00:37:32,765 --> 00:37:34,819
- You can almost feel the history.

693
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:37,560
This is where he danced the
tango and became the sheik.

694
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,610
- You were too young for those pictures.

695
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:41,756
- Mama took me to all of his movies.

696
00:37:41,756 --> 00:37:43,423
She loved Valentino.

697
00:37:44,945 --> 00:37:46,058
Sometimes the way she used to

698
00:37:46,058 --> 00:37:48,029
look at him up there on the screen.

699
00:37:48,029 --> 00:37:51,574
I almost thought he was my father.

700
00:37:51,574 --> 00:37:54,122
I used to imagine that
anybody could be my father,

701
00:37:54,122 --> 00:37:55,629
even Valentino.

702
00:37:55,629 --> 00:37:56,762
He was so famous.

703
00:37:56,762 --> 00:37:58,711
People loved him.

704
00:37:58,711 --> 00:38:01,619
You know they still bring
him flowers, even today.

705
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:04,717
Promise me when I die you'll
bury me near Valentino.

706
00:38:04,717 --> 00:38:07,384
So I can always see his flowers.

707
00:38:19,291 --> 00:38:21,958
(Norma humming)

708
00:38:28,138 --> 00:38:30,555
- What's going on down there?

709
00:38:32,005 --> 00:38:34,467
- [Bob] We're sorry, we didn't
mean to make any trouble.

710
00:38:34,467 --> 00:38:36,163
- We just wanted to dance
where Valentino danced

711
00:38:36,163 --> 00:38:37,871
before they tore it down.

712
00:38:37,871 --> 00:38:40,741
- C'mon pal, is there any
harm in a little romance.

713
00:38:40,741 --> 00:38:42,270
- No, no harm.

714
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:45,187
But you might as well get it right.

715
00:38:54,102 --> 00:38:55,932
(tango record spins)

716
00:38:55,932 --> 00:38:57,564
- You know what this means?

717
00:38:57,564 --> 00:38:59,065
- Yeah, it means we're
the last people to dance

718
00:38:59,065 --> 00:39:00,904
where Valnetino danced.

719
00:39:00,904 --> 00:39:03,987
- More importantly, lets do it right.

720
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,793
- At least I finally finished it.

721
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:58,337
- You did more than
that, it's good, Bobby.

722
00:39:58,337 --> 00:39:59,289
It's really good.

723
00:39:59,289 --> 00:40:00,957
- I sent to a friend at Monogram.

724
00:40:00,957 --> 00:40:01,790
We'll see.

725
00:40:02,665 --> 00:40:04,407
- You mean you might stay for a while?

726
00:40:04,407 --> 00:40:05,929
More than just a week?

727
00:40:05,929 --> 00:40:07,594
- Well that depends.

728
00:40:07,594 --> 00:40:10,191
I figured it was about time that I asked.

729
00:40:10,191 --> 00:40:11,191
- Excuse me.

730
00:40:12,316 --> 00:40:15,288
Ms. Monroe, do you remember me?

731
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:16,620
- Of course, Mr. Hyde.

732
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,526
I met Mr. Hyde in Palm Springs.

733
00:40:18,526 --> 00:40:21,416
- I'm Johnny Hyde, with the Morris office.

734
00:40:21,416 --> 00:40:22,664
- Bob Slatzer.

735
00:40:22,664 --> 00:40:26,081
- I'd been hoping I'd run into you again.

736
00:40:27,906 --> 00:40:30,121
There's a party at Pandro
Berman's house tonight.

737
00:40:30,121 --> 00:40:32,300
I promised I'd stop by.

738
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,999
Would you both like to come?

739
00:40:33,999 --> 00:40:35,859
You'd be with me.

740
00:40:35,859 --> 00:40:37,422
I know they'd be delighted to have you

741
00:40:37,422 --> 00:40:39,375
and not the sort of thing
that could exactly hurt

742
00:40:39,375 --> 00:40:41,552
a struggling young actress.

743
00:40:41,552 --> 00:40:42,385
- Bobby?

744
00:40:43,877 --> 00:40:44,796
- I'll tell you the truth,

745
00:40:44,796 --> 00:40:46,344
I've been on the go for about 18 hours.

746
00:40:46,344 --> 00:40:48,594
I could use some sack time.

747
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:52,022
Why don't you go?

748
00:40:52,022 --> 00:40:54,411
Catch up with me later at the Roosevelt.

749
00:40:54,411 --> 00:40:55,262
- You're sure?

750
00:40:55,262 --> 00:40:56,847
- Yeah, I'm sure.

751
00:40:56,847 --> 00:40:58,702
- Well if you're certain you don't mind,

752
00:40:58,702 --> 00:41:00,627
I promise to have her back at the hotel

753
00:41:00,627 --> 00:41:04,127
at a decent hour, unscathed and untouched.

754
00:41:19,605 --> 00:41:21,387
- And what about your friend Slatzer?

755
00:41:21,387 --> 00:41:23,753
- He's back in town for
the holidays, maybe longer.

756
00:41:23,753 --> 00:41:24,969
- That's good.

757
00:41:24,969 --> 00:41:26,791
You have him give me a
call, I like that guy.

758
00:41:26,791 --> 00:41:27,953
- That makes two of us.

759
00:41:27,953 --> 00:41:31,157
Mr. Winchell, I was wondering
if you'd mind telling me;

760
00:41:31,157 --> 00:41:33,946
is Johnny Hyde the gentleman
everyone says he is?

761
00:41:33,946 --> 00:41:35,904
I think he wants to represent me.

762
00:41:35,904 --> 00:41:37,277
- You take it from me.

763
00:41:37,277 --> 00:41:39,783
If there was a company on
the stock exchange called

764
00:41:39,783 --> 00:41:43,939
Decency Incorporated,
he'd own all the shares.

765
00:41:43,939 --> 00:41:45,641
Excuse me, Marilyn.

766
00:41:45,641 --> 00:41:49,474
I see someone who's dying
to tell me a secret.

767
00:41:50,958 --> 00:41:51,911
Merry Christmas.

768
00:41:51,911 --> 00:41:53,411
- Merry Christmas.

769
00:41:56,963 --> 00:41:58,731
- And what did Mr. Winchell say?

770
00:41:58,731 --> 00:42:00,253
- He said I could trust you.

771
00:42:00,253 --> 00:42:01,677
- I told you he would.

772
00:42:01,677 --> 00:42:03,640
Now will you let me help you?

773
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,000
- Why me?

774
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,833
- You're a smart girl.

775
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:08,626
Your IQ is a lot bigger than

776
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:12,499
those magnificent breasts
of yours so act like it.

777
00:42:12,499 --> 00:42:15,002
All these stars, you know
who they're watching?

778
00:42:15,002 --> 00:42:15,973
You.

779
00:42:15,973 --> 00:42:19,682
And if they do it here, they'll
do it in movie theaters.

780
00:42:19,682 --> 00:42:22,175
I want the world to know you.

781
00:42:22,175 --> 00:42:24,008
That takes work, time,

782
00:42:25,427 --> 00:42:29,270
whoops, something we're
running very short of.

783
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:30,639
We'd better go.

784
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:31,551
- So soon?

785
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,500
- Yes.

786
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,275
I promised your friend that I would

787
00:42:34,275 --> 00:42:36,654
get you back to the hotel unscathed.

788
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:39,904
And I always keep my word, to everyone.

789
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,473
- Bobby.

790
00:42:56,473 --> 00:42:59,014
You would not believe it.

791
00:42:59,014 --> 00:43:00,347
- Well I'll try.

792
00:43:01,351 --> 00:43:03,275
- Johnny Hyde just
offered to change my life.

793
00:43:03,275 --> 00:43:05,006
- Oh, whoopee.

794
00:43:05,006 --> 00:43:07,920
- Acting lessons, singing
lessons, dance, voice.

795
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,043
He wants to shake my career.

796
00:43:10,043 --> 00:43:11,582
He wants to take me under his wing

797
00:43:11,582 --> 00:43:13,732
and make me into a star.

798
00:43:13,732 --> 00:43:16,501
- I thought you wanted to be an actress?

799
00:43:16,501 --> 00:43:19,051
- Are you angry with me
for going to the party?

800
00:43:19,051 --> 00:43:21,064
- No, absolutely not.

801
00:43:21,064 --> 00:43:22,612
It's my own fault for coming 2,000 miles

802
00:43:22,612 --> 00:43:24,460
just because you asked me to.

803
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:25,804
- Oh Bobby.

804
00:43:25,804 --> 00:43:27,200
I'm sorry.

805
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,518
Your first night back and

806
00:43:28,518 --> 00:43:31,518
- No, I said it was okay, it's okay.

807
00:43:32,455 --> 00:43:36,028
But there is something I'd
like to get out of the way.

808
00:43:36,028 --> 00:43:37,615
I've been sitting here drinking this

809
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:41,250
excellent, extraordinarily cheap champagne

810
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:44,135
trying to screw up the
courage to ask you a question.

811
00:43:44,135 --> 00:43:45,390
- Don't ask me to marry you.

812
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:48,377
I mean, you weren't
gonna ask me, were you?

813
00:43:48,377 --> 00:43:50,412
I had this feeling.

814
00:43:50,412 --> 00:43:52,031
- No.

815
00:43:52,031 --> 00:43:54,698
No, I wasn't gonna ask you that.

816
00:43:55,534 --> 00:43:56,451
Yes, I was.

817
00:43:58,954 --> 00:43:59,787
- Bobby.

818
00:44:01,873 --> 00:44:02,790
I love you.

819
00:44:03,699 --> 00:44:07,388
But now's not the time for me
to concentrate on a marriage.

820
00:44:07,388 --> 00:44:09,055
I'd only foul it up.

821
00:44:10,005 --> 00:44:12,172
You understand, don't you?

822
00:44:13,308 --> 00:44:14,141
- Sure.

823
00:44:15,867 --> 00:44:20,034
- But if I ever do get married
again, I hope it's to you.

824
00:44:22,959 --> 00:44:25,377
- I don't want to be bribed, Norma Jean.

825
00:44:25,377 --> 00:44:27,877
- Does this feel like a bribe?

826
00:44:33,624 --> 00:44:34,457
- Yeah.

827
00:44:35,384 --> 00:44:38,075
And thanks for the offer.

828
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:39,242
But no thanks.

829
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:41,980
Not tonight.

830
00:44:44,592 --> 00:44:47,092
(upbeat jazz)

831
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:42,207
- Good evening, sir.

832
00:45:45,745 --> 00:45:48,578
- Norma Jean, I've got great news.

833
00:45:51,285 --> 00:45:53,351
What's goin on?

834
00:45:53,351 --> 00:45:54,873
- I wanted to write you a letter

835
00:45:54,873 --> 00:45:57,047
but I knew I couldn't do that.

836
00:45:57,047 --> 00:45:58,679
I knew I had to tell you.

837
00:45:58,679 --> 00:46:00,434
- Tell me what?

838
00:46:00,434 --> 00:46:02,138
- Johnny Hyde's asked me to move

839
00:46:02,138 --> 00:46:04,385
in a house he owns in Beverly Hills.

840
00:46:04,385 --> 00:46:08,544
He wants me to have a place
where I can entertain people.

841
00:46:08,544 --> 00:46:10,905
Meet the magazine writers, you know.

842
00:46:10,905 --> 00:46:13,980
He's doing so much to make
things happen in my career.

843
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:15,909
And he isn't well.

844
00:46:15,909 --> 00:46:17,456
He's got heart problems.

845
00:46:17,456 --> 00:46:20,429
I just want to be good to him in return.

846
00:46:20,429 --> 00:46:22,094
At least for a while.

847
00:46:22,094 --> 00:46:23,572
- Are you sleeping with him?

848
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:24,739
- No.

849
00:46:24,739 --> 00:46:27,795
I wouldn't do that while
I was living with you.

850
00:46:27,795 --> 00:46:30,512
- Will you sleep with him
when you move into that house?

851
00:46:30,512 --> 00:46:32,012
- I think I might.

852
00:46:38,956 --> 00:46:40,957
- Norma Jean think about
what you're doing here.

853
00:46:40,957 --> 00:46:43,794
The man's 30 years older than
you are and he's married.

854
00:46:43,794 --> 00:46:45,155
- He's getting divorced.

855
00:46:45,155 --> 00:46:47,155
They've already started.

856
00:46:48,378 --> 00:46:49,849
- You love him?

857
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:50,682
- No.

858
00:46:52,284 --> 00:46:53,438
But he isn't well.

859
00:46:53,438 --> 00:46:56,769
I just want to do what's
right, that's all.

860
00:46:56,769 --> 00:47:00,852
I just want to make him
happy for a little while.

861
00:47:06,579 --> 00:47:10,462
Maybe we could get together sometime and,

862
00:47:10,462 --> 00:47:12,319
I don't know.

863
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:14,886
Johnny's got me up for
a John Houston film.

864
00:47:14,886 --> 00:47:19,053
Maybe if I get the part we
could celebrate or something.

865
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:23,870
You didn't get to tell me your news.

866
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:26,720
- It's not important.

867
00:47:28,256 --> 00:47:29,674
- [Norma] I'll call you in a few days.

868
00:47:29,674 --> 00:47:30,507
- Don't.

869
00:47:32,301 --> 00:47:36,943
I'm tired of watching your
life from the sidelines.

870
00:47:36,943 --> 00:47:37,776
- Bobby.

871
00:47:39,321 --> 00:47:41,717
- They're making my script.

872
00:47:41,717 --> 00:47:44,050
Monogram is making my movie.

873
00:47:46,952 --> 00:47:48,369
Miss you already.

874
00:47:50,002 --> 00:47:54,208
You're still the best
drinking buddy I ever had.

875
00:47:54,208 --> 00:47:57,791
Now I would appreciate
it if you'd get out.

876
00:48:33,423 --> 00:48:34,839
- Take the sheet away.

877
00:48:34,839 --> 00:48:36,839
I want to see you again.

878
00:48:45,487 --> 00:48:47,654
Now I can die a happy man.

879
00:48:48,728 --> 00:48:51,695
- Stop talking about dying.

880
00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:53,277
- Sorry but it's a subject

881
00:48:53,277 --> 00:48:56,227
near and dear to my failing heart.

882
00:48:56,227 --> 00:48:58,924
You know, maybe it's time I get rid

883
00:48:58,924 --> 00:49:01,306
of this damn medication of mine.

884
00:49:01,306 --> 00:49:03,117
- Why would you do that?

885
00:49:03,117 --> 00:49:04,365
- May keep my heart beating,

886
00:49:04,365 --> 00:49:08,532
but it doesn't exactly make
me a great partner in bed.

887
00:49:11,914 --> 00:49:14,979
- What we have in bed is wonderful.

888
00:49:14,979 --> 00:49:17,324
It was even better tonight.

889
00:49:17,324 --> 00:49:19,055
- It was, wasn't it?

890
00:49:19,055 --> 00:49:20,222
- Yes, it was.

891
00:49:24,029 --> 00:49:25,807
- I love you, Marilyn.

892
00:49:25,807 --> 00:49:27,465
Marry me.

893
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:28,965
- I can't, Johnny.

894
00:49:29,834 --> 00:49:32,089
I don't love you the same way.

895
00:49:32,089 --> 00:49:33,668
- You don't have to.

896
00:49:33,668 --> 00:49:36,097
My divorce is final, we
could get married tomorrow.

897
00:49:36,097 --> 00:49:36,930
Tonight.

898
00:49:38,413 --> 00:49:39,738
- No.

899
00:49:39,738 --> 00:49:41,366
Sorry.

900
00:49:41,366 --> 00:49:42,199
- Alright.

901
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:45,732
But I at least want you to inherit

902
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:47,997
some of my money after I die.

903
00:49:47,997 --> 00:49:50,263
- I hate all this talk about death.

904
00:49:50,263 --> 00:49:52,430
I want to talk about life.

905
00:49:53,927 --> 00:49:55,713
- What's wrong?

906
00:49:55,713 --> 00:49:56,546
- Nothing.

907
00:49:58,744 --> 00:49:59,611
- Tell me.

908
00:49:59,611 --> 00:50:01,489
- Nothing, Johnny.

909
00:50:01,489 --> 00:50:02,322
Nothing.

910
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:04,313
- Come on.

911
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:07,225
Lets get dressed, lets get out of here.

912
00:50:07,225 --> 00:50:08,975
We need a few laughs.

913
00:50:11,364 --> 00:50:13,864
(swing music)

914
00:50:56,023 --> 00:50:57,473
- Oh, that's the best medicine there is.

915
00:50:57,473 --> 00:50:59,841
- That's what I've been
saying to you all along.

916
00:50:59,841 --> 00:51:02,852
People just can't keep their eyes off you.

917
00:51:02,852 --> 00:51:04,345
Champagne?

918
00:51:04,345 --> 00:51:05,178
- Yes.

919
00:51:08,418 --> 00:51:09,251
Bobby.

920
00:51:11,225 --> 00:51:12,992
- Norma Jean.

921
00:51:12,992 --> 00:51:14,801
Nice to see you again.

922
00:51:14,801 --> 00:51:16,782
- You remember Mr. Hyde.

923
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:19,134
- Yeah, nice to see you
again too, Mr. Hyde.

924
00:51:19,134 --> 00:51:20,634
- Good to see you.

925
00:51:22,309 --> 00:51:23,854
- I'm sorry, this is Diana McShane.

926
00:51:23,854 --> 00:51:24,687
- Hi.

927
00:51:24,687 --> 00:51:25,520
- [Johnny] Good evening.

928
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,363
- Hi, you're Marilyn Monroe, aren't you?

929
00:51:27,363 --> 00:51:28,620
- Yes.

930
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:30,398
- Bob took me to see "Love Happy".

931
00:51:30,398 --> 00:51:31,805
It must have been crazy doin

932
00:51:31,805 --> 00:51:33,833
a movie with those Marx Brothers.

933
00:51:33,833 --> 00:51:35,372
- Oh, it was real crazy.

934
00:51:35,372 --> 00:51:37,343
But I was only there
for a couple of hours.

935
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:39,852
I only had two lines.

936
00:51:39,852 --> 00:51:42,337
- And Bob took me to see
"Scudda Hoo! Scudda Hay!"

937
00:51:42,337 --> 00:51:44,034
- I only had one line in that.

938
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:45,858
Well, it wasn't really a line.

939
00:51:45,858 --> 00:51:48,342
It was really a word.

940
00:51:48,342 --> 00:51:49,675
What I said was,

941
00:51:51,308 --> 00:51:52,141
"Mmm."

942
00:51:55,906 --> 00:51:58,739
(Johnny chuckles)

943
00:52:01,103 --> 00:52:02,051
How are you?

944
00:52:02,051 --> 00:52:02,884
- Fine.

945
00:52:02,884 --> 00:52:04,292
They're shooting my western next month.

946
00:52:04,292 --> 00:52:06,863
Maybe you'd come out to the set?

947
00:52:06,863 --> 00:52:08,196
- I'd like that.

948
00:52:10,606 --> 00:52:13,423
- Well it was nice seeing you again.

949
00:52:13,423 --> 00:52:14,256
- Bye.

950
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:15,423
- [Norma] Bye.

951
00:52:23,487 --> 00:52:24,918
Johnny.

952
00:52:24,918 --> 00:52:26,418
Can you excuse me?

953
00:52:29,926 --> 00:52:30,759
Bobby.

954
00:52:31,775 --> 00:52:33,898
I need to speak to you, it's important.

955
00:52:33,898 --> 00:52:34,731
- Sure.

956
00:52:34,731 --> 00:52:36,249
Give me a call at
Monogram tomorrow morning.

957
00:52:36,249 --> 00:52:38,868
- No, it's very important,
we need to talk now.

958
00:52:38,868 --> 00:52:40,421
- I can't, Norma Jean, I'm with somebody.

959
00:52:40,421 --> 00:52:41,254
- But

960
00:52:41,254 --> 00:52:42,882
- I'm sorry Norma Jean.

961
00:52:42,882 --> 00:52:45,465
Call me tomorrow morning, okay?

962
00:52:48,885 --> 00:52:51,135
(knocking)

963
00:52:54,268 --> 00:52:57,351
(knocking continues)

964
00:53:15,563 --> 00:53:17,242
Norma Jean look,

965
00:53:17,242 --> 00:53:19,148
- I'm pregnant, Bobby.

966
00:53:19,148 --> 00:53:19,981
It isn't his.

967
00:53:19,981 --> 00:53:23,229
He can't have children anymore, it's ours.

968
00:53:23,229 --> 00:53:24,786
Please Bobby.

969
00:53:24,786 --> 00:53:26,675
We have to do something.

970
00:53:26,675 --> 00:53:28,197
Now.

971
00:53:28,197 --> 00:53:29,780
- Okay, okay, okay.

972
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:32,127
Take it easy.

973
00:53:32,127 --> 00:53:34,794
Take it easy we'll do something.

974
00:53:53,746 --> 00:53:57,781
Norma Jean think about this one last time.

975
00:53:57,781 --> 00:54:01,041
- What do you think I've been
doing for the last few hours?

976
00:54:01,041 --> 00:54:02,712
I have no other choice.

977
00:54:02,712 --> 00:54:04,461
- Yes you do.

978
00:54:04,461 --> 00:54:06,642
You can marry me.

979
00:54:06,642 --> 00:54:08,392
We can have the baby.

980
00:54:14,184 --> 00:54:15,851
- [Speaking Spanish]

981
00:54:28,731 --> 00:54:31,032
You're very healthy, muy bueno.

982
00:54:31,032 --> 00:54:32,031
This will be easy.

983
00:54:32,031 --> 00:54:32,864
Up here.

984
00:54:32,864 --> 00:54:35,407
- You're gonna do this on a kitchen table?

985
00:54:35,407 --> 00:54:38,782
- It is a good place, don't worry.

986
00:54:38,782 --> 00:54:39,688
Up here.

987
00:54:39,688 --> 00:54:41,271
- It's okay, Bobby.

988
00:54:44,796 --> 00:54:46,650
- We have no medicine.

989
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:48,141
No sedatives here.

990
00:54:48,141 --> 00:54:50,320
But you can drink all you want.

991
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:53,770
- That's okay, I brought my own.

992
00:54:53,770 --> 00:54:55,463
- Where did you get those?

993
00:54:55,463 --> 00:54:58,630
- They're tranquilizers and they help.

994
00:54:59,614 --> 00:55:01,031
They really help.

995
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:05,301
- Bueno.

996
00:55:05,301 --> 00:55:06,337
You.

997
00:55:06,337 --> 00:55:07,170
Outside.

998
00:55:08,083 --> 00:55:08,916
Okay?

999
00:55:49,815 --> 00:55:53,297
She's just a little sick,
from the tequila maybe.

1000
00:55:53,297 --> 00:55:54,695
- Is she okay, doc?

1001
00:55:54,695 --> 00:55:55,836
- Si.

1002
00:55:55,836 --> 00:55:57,829
All she needs is a little rest.

1003
00:55:57,829 --> 00:55:58,884
Sleep.

1004
00:55:58,884 --> 00:55:59,884
That is all.

1005
00:56:06,671 --> 00:56:08,025
- Where are we going?

1006
00:56:08,025 --> 00:56:09,025
- Back home.

1007
00:56:24,526 --> 00:56:27,697
Don't you think you've
had enough of those?

1008
00:56:27,697 --> 00:56:29,518
- It's for the pain.

1009
00:56:29,518 --> 00:56:32,351
I've got to relax, I need to rest.

1010
00:56:40,972 --> 00:56:42,972
It was our child, Bobby.

1011
00:56:45,005 --> 00:56:46,588
But I had to do it.

1012
00:56:47,886 --> 00:56:50,742
You understand, don't you?

1013
00:56:50,742 --> 00:56:52,008
- Don't ask me that.

1014
00:56:52,008 --> 00:56:53,147
- Bobby.

1015
00:56:53,147 --> 00:56:54,477
- Look, I helped alright?

1016
00:56:54,477 --> 00:56:55,644
I always help.

1017
00:56:57,666 --> 00:57:00,416
Doesn't mean I always understand.

1018
00:57:02,017 --> 00:57:03,100
- Forgive me.

1019
00:57:05,233 --> 00:57:06,066
- Sure.

1020
00:57:08,537 --> 00:57:09,537
Go to sleep.

1021
00:57:16,437 --> 00:57:19,354
(orchestral music)

1022
00:57:44,874 --> 00:57:49,043
After Mexico, Norma Jean
went back to Johnny Hide.

1023
00:57:49,043 --> 00:57:50,732
She won that part in "The Asphalt Jungle"

1024
00:57:50,732 --> 00:57:54,253
and a short time later had a
small part in "All About Eve."

1025
00:57:54,253 --> 00:57:58,798
She wasn't a star yet,
but she was on her way.

1026
00:57:58,798 --> 00:57:59,631
And then.

1027
00:58:08,468 --> 00:58:12,322
- And so John Hyde will be
missed by all who knew him

1028
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:14,858
and whose lives he touched.

1029
00:58:14,858 --> 00:58:18,775
In all of Hollywood,
there was no bigger heart.

1030
00:58:20,022 --> 00:58:22,105
- What is she doing here?

1031
00:58:23,459 --> 00:58:24,427
- I don't know.

1032
00:58:24,427 --> 00:58:26,327
- She has no right to be here.

1033
00:58:26,327 --> 00:58:27,410
Do something.

1034
00:58:33,684 --> 00:58:36,012
- Would you come with
me please, Ms. Monroe?

1035
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:37,337
- Who are you?

1036
00:58:37,337 --> 00:58:39,159
- Please don't make a
scene, just come with me.

1037
00:58:39,159 --> 00:58:40,045
- I just want to say goodbye.

1038
00:58:40,045 --> 00:58:41,063
- Quietly.

1039
00:58:41,063 --> 00:58:43,336
Have respect for the family.

1040
00:58:43,336 --> 00:58:44,852
- I made him happy the last few months,

1041
00:58:44,852 --> 00:58:46,323
nobody else even cared.

1042
00:58:46,323 --> 00:58:47,881
- We want you to leave.

1043
00:58:47,881 --> 00:58:48,714
- Johnny!

1044
00:58:52,007 --> 00:58:53,075
I loved you.

1045
00:58:53,075 --> 00:58:55,242
(sobbing)

1046
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:00,520
I loved you.

1047
00:59:04,488 --> 00:59:06,238
- That's it, come on.

1048
00:59:15,776 --> 00:59:17,729
- Get her out of that house today.

1049
00:59:17,729 --> 00:59:20,107
I want you to pack her clothes,

1050
00:59:20,107 --> 00:59:23,107
throw her out, and change the locks.

1051
01:00:11,169 --> 01:00:13,616
- Bob, you're a life saver.

1052
01:00:13,616 --> 01:00:14,449
Thanks for coming.

1053
01:00:14,449 --> 01:00:15,754
- Well you didn't think I'd

1054
01:00:15,754 --> 01:00:18,837
leave you out on the street, did you?

1055
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:24,413
- You know I loved him, Bobby.

1056
01:00:24,413 --> 01:00:25,475
- Yeah, I know.

1057
01:00:25,475 --> 01:00:27,475
- And you don't hate me?

1058
01:00:28,517 --> 01:00:30,850
- I wish it was that simple.

1059
01:00:33,571 --> 01:00:34,404
Look.

1060
01:00:35,534 --> 01:00:37,846
I could either take you to a hotel or

1061
01:00:37,846 --> 01:00:40,501
I could take you to my place.

1062
01:00:40,501 --> 01:00:41,334
But,

1063
01:00:43,224 --> 01:00:44,477
if I take you to my place,

1064
01:00:44,477 --> 01:00:46,323
it's only for a while until you get set up

1065
01:00:46,323 --> 01:00:48,789
and it's strictly platonic between us.

1066
01:00:48,789 --> 01:00:51,567
- I don't want to go to a hotel.

1067
01:00:51,567 --> 01:00:52,400
- You don't?

1068
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:55,891
- So it's your place until
I get set up somewhere?

1069
01:00:55,891 --> 01:00:57,018
- Okay.

1070
01:00:57,018 --> 01:00:58,829
But, separate beds.

1071
01:00:58,829 --> 01:01:00,412
- Whatever you say.

1072
01:01:01,806 --> 01:01:04,172
- [Bob] I felt bad about
giving in to temptation.

1073
01:01:04,172 --> 01:01:06,126
But she was Marilyn Monroe,

1074
01:01:06,126 --> 01:01:08,108
even though I called her Norma Jean.

1075
01:01:08,108 --> 01:01:09,460
And when she wanted to make love,

1076
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:12,754
she had a way of getting her way.

1077
01:01:12,754 --> 01:01:14,463
I don't know how many guys on earth

1078
01:01:14,463 --> 01:01:16,671
could've turned her down but

1079
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:17,926
I wasn't one of them.

1080
01:01:17,926 --> 01:01:20,423
Sure, I still wanted us to get married but

1081
01:01:20,423 --> 01:01:22,688
I decided to wait until
she felt secure enough

1082
01:01:22,688 --> 01:01:24,652
in her career to settle down.

1083
01:01:24,652 --> 01:01:27,657
I never imagined how impossible
that was for Norma Jean.

1084
01:01:27,657 --> 01:01:29,824
But I would soon find out.

1085
01:01:56,939 --> 01:01:57,772
- Mama!

1086
01:02:02,303 --> 01:02:05,306
Oh mama, I'm so glad you came.

1087
01:02:05,306 --> 01:02:07,906
You look wonderful, really wonderful.

1088
01:02:07,906 --> 01:02:09,287
Doesn't she look wonderful?

1089
01:02:09,287 --> 01:02:10,554
- Yes she does.

1090
01:02:10,554 --> 01:02:12,523
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Baker.

1091
01:02:12,523 --> 01:02:13,699
- This is Bob Slatzer.

1092
01:02:13,699 --> 01:02:17,958
I wrote you about him, don't you remember?

1093
01:02:17,958 --> 01:02:20,651
It's my hair, how do you like my hair?

1094
01:02:20,651 --> 01:02:22,476
You've never seen me blonde before.

1095
01:02:22,476 --> 01:02:24,277
I bet this is really confusing.

1096
01:02:24,277 --> 01:02:26,042
- It's nice.

1097
01:02:26,042 --> 01:02:27,425
- Are you okay?

1098
01:02:27,425 --> 01:02:29,425
Mama was your trip okay?

1099
01:02:30,869 --> 01:02:32,005
- Here, why don't I take the suitcase.

1100
01:02:32,005 --> 01:02:32,838
- No.

1101
01:02:33,763 --> 01:02:35,898
- Well it's very nice to have you

1102
01:02:35,898 --> 01:02:37,879
staying with us, Mrs. Baker.

1103
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:39,460
- I'll bet you're hungry.

1104
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:42,888
Would you like to get something to eat?

1105
01:02:42,888 --> 01:02:44,956
- That would be nice.

1106
01:02:44,956 --> 01:02:46,642
- I was back in the old
neighborhood last month,

1107
01:02:46,642 --> 01:02:48,363
back in Van Nuys?

1108
01:02:48,363 --> 01:02:50,195
Remember Sim's Grocery Store?

1109
01:02:50,195 --> 01:02:52,661
Remember where I used
to sneak a few smokes?

1110
01:02:52,661 --> 01:02:56,828
Well it's still there, the
old store and everything.

1111
01:02:58,958 --> 01:03:00,669
- That's nice.

1112
01:03:00,669 --> 01:03:03,713
- And remember Mrs. Howard,
my old dance teacher?

1113
01:03:03,713 --> 01:03:05,466
She's still there too.

1114
01:03:05,466 --> 01:03:07,307
She still had that ruler,

1115
01:03:07,307 --> 01:03:09,130
the one she used to rap
me on the knuckles with

1116
01:03:09,130 --> 01:03:11,201
when I didn't get the dance step right,

1117
01:03:11,201 --> 01:03:14,451
which was most of the time, right mama?

1118
01:03:18,518 --> 01:03:20,867
When she saw me, she
remembered me right away.

1119
01:03:20,867 --> 01:03:22,396
She asked me what I was doing

1120
01:03:22,396 --> 01:03:26,146
and I told her I was
trying to be an actress.

1121
01:03:29,534 --> 01:03:31,317
She told me I was wasting my time.

1122
01:03:31,317 --> 01:03:34,077
That I didn't have any
talent in her class.

1123
01:03:34,077 --> 01:03:37,194
When I asked her how she
could be so sure she said,

1124
01:03:37,194 --> 01:03:40,611
"Because when you danced nobody clapped."

1125
01:03:42,572 --> 01:03:45,155
(Bob chuckles)

1126
01:03:49,398 --> 01:03:51,295
Won't you please talk to me mama?

1127
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:53,878
I've waited so long to see you.

1128
01:03:56,428 --> 01:04:00,011
- Tell you what, lets
go back to the house.

1129
01:04:01,229 --> 01:04:02,830
She isn't ready yet, Norma Jean.

1130
01:04:02,830 --> 01:04:04,989
Maybe this is all just a
little too much for her.

1131
01:04:04,989 --> 01:04:06,710
- But she has to hear me.

1132
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:07,888
- Give it a little time.

1133
01:04:07,888 --> 01:04:09,384
- I need you, mama.

1134
01:04:09,384 --> 01:04:11,294
I need to know that you hear me.

1135
01:04:11,294 --> 01:04:12,127
Please.

1136
01:04:14,645 --> 01:04:15,478
- Norma Jean.

1137
01:04:15,478 --> 01:04:16,478
- Yes, mama?

1138
01:04:18,631 --> 01:04:21,631
- I want to go back to the hospital.

1139
01:04:23,450 --> 01:04:24,516
- Mama wait.

1140
01:04:24,516 --> 01:04:25,696
I'll come too, just wait.

1141
01:04:25,696 --> 01:04:26,529
- No.

1142
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:28,112
I want to go alone.

1143
01:04:31,012 --> 01:04:34,591
Please do you have to forgive me?

1144
01:04:34,591 --> 01:04:35,424
- Mama.

1145
01:04:41,873 --> 01:04:43,142
- Norma Jean, wait.

1146
01:04:43,142 --> 01:04:44,615
- Stay away from me,
Bobby, I'm no good for you.

1147
01:04:44,615 --> 01:04:45,961
- Stop!

1148
01:04:45,961 --> 01:04:46,794
Stop this.

1149
01:04:46,794 --> 01:04:48,959
- Don't you understand,
I'm just like my mother.

1150
01:04:48,959 --> 01:04:50,976
- Stop talking like that.

1151
01:04:50,976 --> 01:04:52,916
- My grandparents both
died in an institution

1152
01:04:52,916 --> 01:04:56,749
and my mother will and
so will I so stay away!

1153
01:04:58,491 --> 01:04:59,340
- Norma!

1154
01:04:59,340 --> 01:05:00,173
Norma Jean!

1155
01:05:00,173 --> 01:05:02,444
- I don't have any time,
don't you understand?

1156
01:05:02,444 --> 01:05:04,444
I'm running out of time.

1157
01:05:18,237 --> 01:05:19,237
- Afternoon.

1158
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:22,880
- [Bob] Norma Jean got a place of her own

1159
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,910
and then we lost touch.

1160
01:05:24,910 --> 01:05:27,609
She wouldn't even return the phone calls.

1161
01:05:27,609 --> 01:05:29,509
I understood her fear now,

1162
01:05:29,509 --> 01:05:32,522
but that didn't make it any
easier for me to lose her.

1163
01:05:32,522 --> 01:05:34,746
But in the beginning of 1952,

1164
01:05:34,746 --> 01:05:37,228
she'd done some small parts in some films.

1165
01:05:37,228 --> 01:05:41,395
She still wasn't a star but
she was becoming a celebrity.

1166
01:05:42,752 --> 01:05:45,095
Especially when she started
dating the Yankee clipper,

1167
01:05:45,095 --> 01:05:46,178
Joe DiMaggio.

1168
01:06:04,572 --> 01:06:07,527
I made a few movies myself.

1169
01:06:07,527 --> 01:06:08,444
B westerns.

1170
01:06:09,641 --> 01:06:13,808
Not exactly the big time, but
it sure beat washing dishes.

1171
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:19,160
(phone rings)

1172
01:06:23,511 --> 01:06:24,711
Hello?

1173
01:06:24,711 --> 01:06:26,461
- Bobby, is that you?

1174
01:06:28,424 --> 01:06:30,741
- Hey, how ya been?

1175
01:06:30,741 --> 01:06:33,273
- You don't sound happy to hear from me.

1176
01:06:33,273 --> 01:06:35,190
- No, I'm tickled pink.

1177
01:06:38,743 --> 01:06:40,617
- Sounds like you need some cheering up.

1178
01:06:40,617 --> 01:06:42,097
Why don't you come here for a visit?

1179
01:06:42,097 --> 01:06:46,264
- Well Niagara Falls is
strictly for honeymooners.

1180
01:06:47,107 --> 01:06:49,409
- Bobby I need you.

1181
01:06:49,409 --> 01:06:51,809
It's been awful, I'm
doing everything wrong.

1182
01:06:51,809 --> 01:06:54,559
Mr. Hathaway is ready to kill me.

1183
01:06:56,908 --> 01:06:58,676
- Suppose DiMaggio is busy?

1184
01:06:58,676 --> 01:07:01,593
- I didn't ask him, I'm asking you.

1185
01:07:04,234 --> 01:07:05,801
If you don't want to help me, fine.

1186
01:07:05,801 --> 01:07:08,134
(dial tone)

1187
01:07:24,056 --> 01:07:24,889
- Jack.

1188
01:07:26,409 --> 01:07:27,826
I need some time.

1189
01:07:29,281 --> 01:07:32,880
Norma Jean, I mean,
Marilyn's having some trouble

1190
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:34,702
on this movie she's doing.

1191
01:07:34,702 --> 01:07:36,228
- What are you, her priest?

1192
01:07:36,228 --> 01:07:37,525
- No, I'm just a friend.

1193
01:07:37,525 --> 01:07:38,987
- What about my movie?

1194
01:07:38,987 --> 01:07:40,528
- I'll be back in a week.

1195
01:07:40,528 --> 01:07:42,042
- No you won't, Bob.

1196
01:07:42,042 --> 01:07:45,688
If you take a walk, I'll
have to replace you.

1197
01:07:45,688 --> 01:07:47,874
- Come on, Jack, she asked for my help.

1198
01:07:47,874 --> 01:07:51,674
- No, you're the one that needs the help.

1199
01:07:51,674 --> 01:07:53,677
- Look, she's scared, alright.

1200
01:07:53,677 --> 01:07:56,919
"Niagara" is her first starring
role and she's messing up.

1201
01:07:56,919 --> 01:07:58,296
- Tell me something.

1202
01:07:58,296 --> 01:08:00,963
What do you get out of the deal?

1203
01:08:02,009 --> 01:08:04,491
- Some of the best days of my life.

1204
01:08:04,491 --> 01:08:05,991
Some of the worst.

1205
01:08:07,010 --> 01:08:09,510
(upbeat jazz)

1206
01:08:41,869 --> 01:08:44,333
- Pull her away from
the fan club, will you,

1207
01:08:44,333 --> 01:08:45,617
and lets get this shot moving.

1208
01:08:45,617 --> 01:08:46,534
- Yes, sir.

1209
01:08:49,114 --> 01:08:51,084
Ms. Monroe, Ms. Monroe.

1210
01:08:51,084 --> 01:08:54,842
Ms. Monroe, Mr. Hath would
like you back to set, please.

1211
01:08:54,842 --> 01:08:56,757
- I'll be finished in a few minutes.

1212
01:08:56,757 --> 01:08:59,099
- They're just fans, Ms.
Monroe, they'll understand.

1213
01:08:59,099 --> 01:09:02,843
- But I won't. Just a few more minutes.

1214
01:09:02,843 --> 01:09:04,315
- I don't think Mr. Hathaway's
going to approve of this.

1215
01:09:04,315 --> 01:09:05,489
- Really?

1216
01:09:05,489 --> 01:09:09,156
Well how do you think
he'll feel about this?

1217
01:09:16,016 --> 01:09:18,056
- Hi, my name is Bob Slatzer.

1218
01:09:18,056 --> 01:09:19,374
Marilyn sent for me?

1219
01:09:19,374 --> 01:09:20,457
I'm a friend.

1220
01:09:22,056 --> 01:09:23,509
You mind if I go say hello to her?

1221
01:09:23,509 --> 01:09:25,259
- Suit yourself, bud.

1222
01:09:32,546 --> 01:09:33,379
- Bobby!

1223
01:09:34,236 --> 01:09:35,069
You came!

1224
01:09:37,605 --> 01:09:39,330
And just in time.

1225
01:09:39,330 --> 01:09:41,964
- I don't know, Norma Jean,
looks like I got here too late.

1226
01:09:41,964 --> 01:09:43,134
- You saw?

1227
01:09:43,134 --> 01:09:44,301
- Yeah, I saw.

1228
01:09:45,436 --> 01:09:47,269
- I think I was wrong.

1229
01:09:48,876 --> 01:09:50,291
- Well, I think this is what

1230
01:09:50,291 --> 01:09:52,464
you've been fighting for all your life.

1231
01:09:52,464 --> 01:09:54,490
And now you're throwing it away.

1232
01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:55,437
- It's my life.

1233
01:09:55,437 --> 01:09:56,270
- Yeah.

1234
01:09:58,137 --> 01:09:59,703
But ever since I've known you,

1235
01:09:59,703 --> 01:10:01,712
you life's been about acting.

1236
01:10:01,712 --> 01:10:02,575
Now you've got the starring role

1237
01:10:02,575 --> 01:10:04,657
in a Henry Hathaway picture and.

1238
01:10:04,657 --> 01:10:06,177
- Bobby, I'm tired.

1239
01:10:06,177 --> 01:10:07,243
No lectures.

1240
01:10:07,243 --> 01:10:10,586
- Norma Jean, this is a business.

1241
01:10:10,586 --> 01:10:12,593
You can't get up one morning and say,

1242
01:10:12,593 --> 01:10:15,636
"I'm scared, call of the extras,
to hell with the director."

1243
01:10:15,636 --> 01:10:16,699
- I can do whatever I want.

1244
01:10:16,699 --> 01:10:17,949
- No you can't.

1245
01:10:19,125 --> 01:10:22,580
Not without wrecking your
career before it even takes off.

1246
01:10:22,580 --> 01:10:23,830
Fear is normal.

1247
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:27,840
You just have to stop taking
it out on everybody else.

1248
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:28,673
- I'm not afraid.

1249
01:10:28,673 --> 01:10:31,778
- You are afraid right down to your bones.

1250
01:10:31,778 --> 01:10:33,474
You're afraid to carry the entire movie

1251
01:10:33,474 --> 01:10:35,478
on your own shoulders,
and I don't blame you.

1252
01:10:35,478 --> 01:10:37,231
- I don't get it.

1253
01:10:37,231 --> 01:10:41,398
How does a nobody like you
talk to me about success?

1254
01:10:46,170 --> 01:10:47,003
Oh, Bobby.

1255
01:10:48,967 --> 01:10:50,848
- Listen to me, I am not a nobody.

1256
01:10:50,848 --> 01:10:55,015
The only thing I have ever
failed at in my life is you.

1257
01:10:57,472 --> 01:11:00,337
I can't seem to get us right.

1258
01:11:00,337 --> 01:11:01,280
- Where are you going?

1259
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:02,475
- [Bob] Back to LA.

1260
01:11:02,475 --> 01:11:04,296
- Don't you dare walk out on me like that.

1261
01:11:04,296 --> 01:11:05,821
- Bye.

1262
01:11:05,821 --> 01:11:06,654
- Don't!

1263
01:11:08,607 --> 01:11:09,440
- Ow!

1264
01:11:11,741 --> 01:11:13,400
- Oh my God, oh my God.

1265
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:15,817
What did I do, what did I do?

1266
01:11:21,244 --> 01:11:22,616
I don't mean to hurt you.

1267
01:11:22,616 --> 01:11:24,699
But I do it all the time.

1268
01:11:26,428 --> 01:11:28,511
And I hate myself for it.

1269
01:11:32,442 --> 01:11:33,359
I love you.

1270
01:11:37,559 --> 01:11:39,926
Why don't you ever give up on me?

1271
01:11:39,926 --> 01:11:41,766
- Because you're exciting.

1272
01:11:41,766 --> 01:11:43,849
And incredibly beautiful.

1273
01:11:46,094 --> 01:11:47,157
And the way you look at me

1274
01:11:47,157 --> 01:11:50,157
makes me feel like your leading man.

1275
01:11:53,391 --> 01:11:54,889
- Marilyn?

1276
01:11:54,889 --> 01:11:56,737
I want you to just walk down the steps,

1277
01:11:56,737 --> 01:11:59,724
make a bee line for the
camera and then turn left.

1278
01:11:59,724 --> 01:12:01,391
- Yes, Mr. Hathaway.

1279
01:12:06,236 --> 01:12:08,879
- She's been great the past
few days, a real pleasure.

1280
01:12:08,879 --> 01:12:09,945
What's with her?

1281
01:12:09,945 --> 01:12:11,278
- Not what, who.

1282
01:12:14,388 --> 01:12:16,471
- [Hathaway] And, action!

1283
01:12:34,853 --> 01:12:35,686
- [Cameraman] Enough?

1284
01:12:35,686 --> 01:12:37,353
- No, keep it going.

1285
01:12:39,743 --> 01:12:41,596
- She's gonna get mad, Henry.

1286
01:12:41,596 --> 01:12:43,079
- No she won't, Mr. Hathaway.

1287
01:12:43,079 --> 01:12:44,329
She'll be fine.

1288
01:12:45,406 --> 01:12:46,239
- Men.

1289
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:47,367
Say cut already, Henry.

1290
01:12:47,367 --> 01:12:48,686
You've shot more film on my keister

1291
01:12:48,686 --> 01:12:51,186
than you have on my close-ups.

1292
01:12:53,981 --> 01:12:55,455
- [Hathaway] Cut!

1293
01:12:55,455 --> 01:12:59,005
(cheering and applause)

1294
01:12:59,005 --> 01:13:01,505
(sultry jazz)

1295
01:13:10,162 --> 01:13:13,534
- [Bob] After "Niagara" was
finished, we went back to LA.

1296
01:13:13,534 --> 01:13:15,574
Henry Hathaway seemed to
be happy with the picture

1297
01:13:15,574 --> 01:13:17,685
and so was Norma Jean.

1298
01:13:17,685 --> 01:13:19,434
As for me, I was fired.

1299
01:13:19,434 --> 01:13:21,765
The price of getting her back.

1300
01:13:21,765 --> 01:13:23,589
Not that we were going to live together.

1301
01:13:23,589 --> 01:13:26,340
We'd both had enough of that for a while.

1302
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:29,340
But we were dating pretty regularly.

1303
01:13:34,578 --> 01:13:37,328
(doorbell rings)

1304
01:13:48,850 --> 01:13:52,017
(car engine settling)

1305
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:23,607
She's not home, Mr. DiMaggio.

1306
01:14:24,908 --> 01:14:25,908
- I'll wait.

1307
01:14:32,917 --> 01:14:33,992
- Cigarette?

1308
01:14:33,992 --> 01:14:35,325
- No, thank you.

1309
01:14:57,938 --> 01:14:59,114
- Sorry, Joe, honey.

1310
01:14:59,114 --> 01:15:00,562
It's just a little dent.

1311
01:15:00,562 --> 01:15:02,014
- Forget it.

1312
01:15:02,014 --> 01:15:03,347
Who is this guy?

1313
01:15:04,245 --> 01:15:05,078
- Bobby?

1314
01:15:05,078 --> 01:15:06,454
What are you doing here?

1315
01:15:06,454 --> 01:15:07,740
- We have a date, remember?

1316
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:08,657
- So do we.

1317
01:15:09,930 --> 01:15:12,126
- I guess I screwed up, huh?

1318
01:15:12,126 --> 01:15:13,814
- [Bob] Guess so.

1319
01:15:13,814 --> 01:15:17,647
- Why don't we all go
inside and have a drink?

1320
01:15:23,727 --> 01:15:25,977
- What would you like, Joe?

1321
01:15:28,676 --> 01:15:31,413
- How come he knows where the bar is?

1322
01:15:31,413 --> 01:15:33,170
- This is my house, Joe.

1323
01:15:33,170 --> 01:15:34,336
Bob's a friend.

1324
01:15:34,336 --> 01:15:35,211
He's been here before.

1325
01:15:35,211 --> 01:15:36,954
- He acts like he lives here.

1326
01:15:36,954 --> 01:15:38,559
I don't like it.

1327
01:15:38,559 --> 01:15:42,486
- I just remember where
the bar is, that's all.

1328
01:15:42,486 --> 01:15:44,015
- Who are you going out with Marilyn?

1329
01:15:44,015 --> 01:15:44,848
Make up your mind.

1330
01:15:44,848 --> 01:15:46,785
- I don't like being pressured, Joe.

1331
01:15:46,785 --> 01:15:47,943
- Fine.

1332
01:15:47,943 --> 01:15:48,776
Fine.

1333
01:15:51,933 --> 01:15:52,850
Good night.

1334
01:15:56,369 --> 01:15:57,869
- Good night, Joe.

1335
01:16:04,827 --> 01:16:07,146
- [Bob] Gee, he took that
pretty hard, didn't he?

1336
01:16:07,146 --> 01:16:09,336
- You did that on purpose.

1337
01:16:09,336 --> 01:16:11,123
- Wait a minute, Norma Jean.

1338
01:16:11,123 --> 01:16:12,211
- Get out.

1339
01:16:12,211 --> 01:16:14,933
I don't want to manipulated
by either one of you.

1340
01:16:14,933 --> 01:16:15,766
Get out!

1341
01:16:17,540 --> 01:16:20,040
(somber jazz)

1342
01:16:41,034 --> 01:16:41,867
- Marilyn?

1343
01:16:41,867 --> 01:16:43,169
Slow down.

1344
01:16:43,169 --> 01:16:44,539
Are you always in such a hurry?

1345
01:16:44,539 --> 01:16:45,868
- I'm on a tight ship, Mr. Zanuck,

1346
01:16:45,868 --> 01:16:47,190
I don't want to miss my call.

1347
01:16:47,190 --> 01:16:49,184
- I'm going to see a cut
of "Niagara" next week.

1348
01:16:49,184 --> 01:16:51,857
I hear good things, especially about you.

1349
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:53,536
- I hope they're all true.

1350
01:16:53,536 --> 01:16:55,309
- You know what I predict, Marilyn?

1351
01:16:55,309 --> 01:16:57,976
I predict a great future for us.

1352
01:16:59,308 --> 01:17:00,323
- Aren't you the same man

1353
01:17:00,323 --> 01:17:01,937
who wouldn't give me a contract with Fox

1354
01:17:01,937 --> 01:17:03,298
because you didn't think I was photogenic?

1355
01:17:03,298 --> 01:17:04,952
- Someone may have been foolish enough

1356
01:17:04,952 --> 01:17:06,697
to say so a few years ago,

1357
01:17:06,697 --> 01:17:08,361
but you've given him ample
reason to regret such

1358
01:17:08,361 --> 01:17:09,965
very poor judgment.

1359
01:17:09,965 --> 01:17:11,959
Now what's this I hear about you and Joe?

1360
01:17:11,959 --> 01:17:14,042
Nothing I hate more than seeing

1361
01:17:14,042 --> 01:17:16,083
my favorite people having a spat.

1362
01:17:16,083 --> 01:17:17,544
- It's not a spat, really.

1363
01:17:17,544 --> 01:17:18,909
- Well I don't care what it was.

1364
01:17:18,909 --> 01:17:20,760
I want you two to kiss and make up.

1365
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:21,593
- But

1366
01:17:21,593 --> 01:17:23,562
- Want to keep me happy,
that's what you'll do,

1367
01:17:23,562 --> 01:17:24,979
kiss and make up.

1368
01:17:37,356 --> 01:17:39,978
(knocking)

1369
01:17:39,978 --> 01:17:43,061
(knocking continues)

1370
01:17:47,475 --> 01:17:49,142
- Look at that moon.

1371
01:17:50,156 --> 01:17:51,829
- What are you doin here?

1372
01:17:51,829 --> 01:17:54,329
- I thought we needed a drink.

1373
01:18:00,623 --> 01:18:03,421
- What are we celebrating?

1374
01:18:03,421 --> 01:18:05,585
(Norma laughing)

1375
01:18:05,585 --> 01:18:06,972
- Whoops!

1376
01:18:06,972 --> 01:18:08,472
I baptized myself.

1377
01:18:12,343 --> 01:18:15,051
That's what the mother said
in "The Glass Menagerie".

1378
01:18:15,051 --> 01:18:17,718
(both laughing)

1379
01:18:20,020 --> 01:18:21,603
Joe proposed to me.

1380
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,167
- What did you say to him?

1381
01:18:30,868 --> 01:18:31,868
- I said no.

1382
01:18:33,678 --> 01:18:35,404
Zanuck told me I should marry him.

1383
01:18:35,404 --> 01:18:38,224
So did half the people on the Fox lot.

1384
01:18:38,224 --> 01:18:39,057
So.

1385
01:18:39,057 --> 01:18:42,514
Everyone wants me to get married.

1386
01:18:42,514 --> 01:18:43,847
Bobby, marry me.

1387
01:18:45,650 --> 01:18:47,567
We can do it in Mexico.

1388
01:18:48,781 --> 01:18:50,579
- Are you serious?

1389
01:18:50,579 --> 01:18:52,878
- You've been wanting to
marry me for a long time.

1390
01:18:52,878 --> 01:18:53,795
Lets do it.

1391
01:18:55,069 --> 01:18:57,114
- Oh, this is crazy.

1392
01:18:57,114 --> 01:19:00,773
No, this is too impulsive,
this will never work.

1393
01:19:00,773 --> 01:19:04,393
- You've been trying to get
me to the altar for six years

1394
01:19:04,393 --> 01:19:07,733
and you have the nerve
to call me impulsive?

1395
01:19:07,733 --> 01:19:09,233
I love you, Bobby.

1396
01:19:10,293 --> 01:19:11,126
Marry me.

1397
01:19:14,285 --> 01:19:18,285
- It's not the way I had
it planned, Norma Jean.

1398
01:19:25,739 --> 01:19:26,886
- Help me do what I want us to do

1399
01:19:26,886 --> 01:19:29,386
for the first time in my life.

1400
01:19:30,697 --> 01:19:32,788
- We leave now, there's no turning back.

1401
01:19:32,788 --> 01:19:34,955
- Not until we're married.

1402
01:19:36,489 --> 01:19:37,322
- We're gonna go all the way this time,

1403
01:19:37,322 --> 01:19:38,749
there's no stopping us.

1404
01:19:38,749 --> 01:19:41,166
- So what are we waiting for?

1405
01:19:45,519 --> 01:19:47,395
- [Minister] And Norma Jean,

1406
01:19:47,395 --> 01:19:48,580
by the laws of the state of Baja,

1407
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:50,621
in the Republic of Mexico,

1408
01:19:50,621 --> 01:19:53,454
I now pronounce you, man and wife.

1409
01:19:54,420 --> 01:19:56,503
Please, a beautiful kiss.

1410
01:20:05,953 --> 01:20:08,620
(both giggling)

1411
01:20:11,797 --> 01:20:14,465
- We really did it, didn't we?

1412
01:20:14,465 --> 01:20:15,334
- Don't pinch me.

1413
01:20:15,334 --> 01:20:17,248
If I'm dreaming, I don't want to wake up.

1414
01:20:17,248 --> 01:20:20,270
- I don't feel any different yet.

1415
01:20:20,270 --> 01:20:21,895
- I do.

1416
01:20:21,895 --> 01:20:24,478
Oh I feel incredibly different.

1417
01:20:27,515 --> 01:20:29,960
- I wish we could stay in Mexico.

1418
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:31,936
I wish we didn't have to go back.

1419
01:20:31,936 --> 01:20:35,203
- Marilyn, I didn't marry you
so that we could run away.

1420
01:20:35,203 --> 01:20:38,658
I married so that we could
weather the tough times together.

1421
01:20:38,658 --> 01:20:41,611
We don't have to hide anymore.

1422
01:20:41,611 --> 01:20:43,337
We'll handle Zanuck and the studio

1423
01:20:43,337 --> 01:20:45,472
and we'll do it together.

1424
01:20:45,472 --> 01:20:47,793
- You called me Marilyn.

1425
01:20:47,793 --> 01:20:49,161
- Yeah, I guess I did.

1426
01:20:49,161 --> 01:20:49,994
- Don't.

1427
01:20:49,994 --> 01:20:51,819
I like it when you call me Norma Jean.

1428
01:20:51,819 --> 01:20:53,170
- Okay.

1429
01:20:53,170 --> 01:20:54,952
Then Norma Jean it is.

1430
01:20:54,952 --> 01:20:55,785
For now

1431
01:20:59,008 --> 01:21:00,008
and forever.

1432
01:21:06,966 --> 01:21:10,171
- [Fox Exec] She has definitely got it.

1433
01:21:10,171 --> 01:21:12,489
This is one beautiful doll.

1434
01:21:12,489 --> 01:21:14,246
- You want to tear her clothes off,

1435
01:21:14,246 --> 01:21:17,976
she's willing to be gentle about it.

1436
01:21:17,976 --> 01:21:20,012
You know men don't dream
about jumping into the sack

1437
01:21:20,012 --> 01:21:22,851
with Betty Grable anymore,
they need something new.

1438
01:21:22,851 --> 01:21:24,934
They need Marilyn Monroe.

1439
01:21:25,783 --> 01:21:28,042
She's already getting
1,000 fan letters a week.

1440
01:21:28,042 --> 01:21:30,052
When "Niagara" opens,
that number could double,

1441
01:21:30,052 --> 01:21:31,552
maybe even triple.

1442
01:21:32,556 --> 01:21:35,796
Marilyn could become this
studio's most valuable asset.

1443
01:21:35,796 --> 01:21:39,766
- Then why is she getting
married in Mexico?

1444
01:21:39,766 --> 01:21:41,718
My secretary's sister works in wardrobe.

1445
01:21:41,718 --> 01:21:43,109
Said Marilyn borrowed an outfit

1446
01:21:43,109 --> 01:21:45,554
and went to tie the knot with some guy.

1447
01:21:45,554 --> 01:21:47,887
And it was not Joe DiMaggio.

1448
01:21:51,323 --> 01:21:53,990
(both giggling)

1449
01:22:04,702 --> 01:22:07,369
(phone ringing)

1450
01:22:11,502 --> 01:22:12,335
- Hello?

1451
01:22:14,512 --> 01:22:15,345
Yes.

1452
01:22:16,723 --> 01:22:17,806
It's for you.

1453
01:22:22,588 --> 01:22:23,421
- Yes?

1454
01:22:30,928 --> 01:22:32,203
Yes, Mr. Zanuck.

1455
01:22:32,203 --> 01:22:34,203
We'll be there tomorrow.

1456
01:22:42,786 --> 01:22:45,781
- Well you two kids, welcome back.

1457
01:22:45,781 --> 01:22:48,281
Marilyn, I'm so happy for you.

1458
01:22:49,825 --> 01:22:52,667
This must be the lucky
fellow, Bob Slatzer.

1459
01:22:52,667 --> 01:22:54,681
You two, what a pleasure.

1460
01:22:54,681 --> 01:22:57,595
Right off the bat with congratulations.

1461
01:22:57,595 --> 01:22:58,620
Come sit down, please.

1462
01:22:58,620 --> 01:23:00,304
- Thank you, Mr. Zanuck.

1463
01:23:00,304 --> 01:23:01,811
- Thank you.

1464
01:23:01,811 --> 01:23:05,478
Marilyn thought you
might be a little upset.

1465
01:23:07,428 --> 01:23:08,842
- Why would I be upset?

1466
01:23:08,842 --> 01:23:12,796
We can't control matters of
the human heart, now can we?

1467
01:23:12,796 --> 01:23:16,296
If I could, all my pictures would be hits.

1468
01:23:18,666 --> 01:23:20,955
Now, whatever makes Marilyn happy,

1469
01:23:20,955 --> 01:23:23,011
that's all that matters.

1470
01:23:23,011 --> 01:23:25,236
This marriage will only set
her back for a little while.

1471
01:23:25,236 --> 01:23:26,777
The damage, it's reparable.

1472
01:23:26,777 --> 01:23:27,668
- Damage?

1473
01:23:27,668 --> 01:23:29,488
- Come on Marilyn, lets don't be naive.

1474
01:23:29,488 --> 01:23:32,237
What do you think you're
selling up there on the screen?

1475
01:23:32,237 --> 01:23:33,507
Sex.

1476
01:23:33,507 --> 01:23:35,475
Plus talent, of course,
but the men who buy tickets

1477
01:23:35,475 --> 01:23:37,898
to come and see you, well they like to

1478
01:23:37,898 --> 01:23:40,778
imagine that you're available.

1479
01:23:40,778 --> 01:23:43,191
And when they find out you're married,

1480
01:23:43,191 --> 01:23:45,907
well you lose some of your appeal.

1481
01:23:45,907 --> 01:23:47,724
We have to protect ourselves.

1482
01:23:47,724 --> 01:23:49,839
We have to cut back on some of the ads,

1483
01:23:49,839 --> 01:23:51,735
the campaign for "Niagara".

1484
01:23:51,735 --> 01:23:52,829
- Excuse me.

1485
01:23:52,829 --> 01:23:54,989
Is that why you called us in here?

1486
01:23:54,989 --> 01:23:56,822
To intimidate my wife?

1487
01:23:58,096 --> 01:24:00,260
- I'm not an ogre, Mr. Slatzer.

1488
01:24:00,260 --> 01:24:04,853
I can't stop Marilyn from
doing what she wants.

1489
01:24:04,853 --> 01:24:07,348
All I can do is advise.

1490
01:24:07,348 --> 01:24:10,931
In my opinion, this
marriage is bad timing.

1491
01:24:12,718 --> 01:24:17,699
Now, it's Marilyn's happiness
and it's Marilyn's decision.

1492
01:24:17,699 --> 01:24:19,358
- Well I'm glad to hear you say that.

1493
01:24:19,358 --> 01:24:21,807
- Point is, what's going
to make Marilyn happy.

1494
01:24:21,807 --> 01:24:25,463
Is it to follow through with
"Niagara", make the most of it,

1495
01:24:25,463 --> 01:24:29,546
or wait a couple of years
in the hopes that maybe

1496
01:24:30,529 --> 01:24:33,386
a role this good might come along again.

1497
01:24:33,386 --> 01:24:35,742
- What are you suggesting?

1498
01:24:35,742 --> 01:24:36,992
- An annulment.

1499
01:24:38,095 --> 01:24:39,206
I know, I know.

1500
01:24:39,206 --> 01:24:41,401
It seems like an enormous sacrifice.

1501
01:24:41,401 --> 01:24:43,080
But hear me out.

1502
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:46,348
Go back to Mexico, get this
marriage wiped off the books.

1503
01:24:46,348 --> 01:24:47,656
And wait.

1504
01:24:47,656 --> 01:24:51,100
A year or so from now, you
kids can get married again.

1505
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:55,017
After "Niagara" has made
Marilyn Monroe a star.

1506
01:24:56,652 --> 01:24:57,871
Now I want you to understand,

1507
01:24:57,871 --> 01:25:01,242
I don't like putting this
kind of pressure on you two.

1508
01:25:01,242 --> 01:25:04,202
But we have an entire
campaign sitting on hold

1509
01:25:04,202 --> 01:25:06,290
just because of this.

1510
01:25:06,290 --> 01:25:08,394
We have to know.

1511
01:25:08,394 --> 01:25:09,227
Now.

1512
01:25:12,458 --> 01:25:14,518
I'm going to leave you two alone.

1513
01:25:14,518 --> 01:25:17,601
You have a very big decision to make.

1514
01:25:27,656 --> 01:25:31,392
- Well it's easy to see how
he got to be a studio boss.

1515
01:25:31,392 --> 01:25:33,538
- What are we going to do?

1516
01:25:33,538 --> 01:25:34,371
- Do?

1517
01:25:35,462 --> 01:25:37,629
We tell him to go to hell.

1518
01:25:39,539 --> 01:25:41,840
He's bluffing, Norma Jean.

1519
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:44,259
They're not gonna hold back on "Niagara",

1520
01:25:44,259 --> 01:25:46,972
not after they already
spent the money to make it.

1521
01:25:46,972 --> 01:25:48,889
- How do you know that?

1522
01:25:49,979 --> 01:25:53,621
Tell me Bobby, how can you be so sure?

1523
01:25:53,621 --> 01:25:56,563
What Mr. Zanuck said, it
made sense, didn't it?

1524
01:25:56,563 --> 01:25:57,396
Didn't it?

1525
01:25:59,493 --> 01:26:01,826
"Niagara" is my lucky break.

1526
01:26:03,456 --> 01:26:07,206
It's everything that
you told me it could be.

1527
01:26:08,494 --> 01:26:10,012
What if it's ruined?

1528
01:26:10,012 --> 01:26:12,345
What if the press finds out?

1529
01:26:14,056 --> 01:26:15,306
- Take it easy.

1530
01:26:16,444 --> 01:26:17,277
Alright?

1531
01:26:20,567 --> 01:26:24,734
I'm not gonna let anyone or
anything ruin this for you.

1532
01:26:26,436 --> 01:26:27,436
Not even me.

1533
01:26:30,737 --> 01:26:32,987
- I don't want to lose you.

1534
01:26:34,756 --> 01:26:37,028
You must believe that.

1535
01:26:37,028 --> 01:26:39,445
- You're never gonna lose me.

1536
01:26:40,721 --> 01:26:44,721
But, maybe for now, maybe
it would be best if we

1537
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:49,507
went along with him.

1538
01:26:52,844 --> 01:26:54,261
- Maybe it would.

1539
01:27:01,491 --> 01:27:04,908
- So, has your marriage been consummated?

1540
01:27:05,784 --> 01:27:07,111
- [Together] Yes.

1541
01:27:07,111 --> 01:27:08,754
- You want no record of the marriage?

1542
01:27:08,754 --> 01:27:11,001
- That's correct.

1543
01:27:11,001 --> 01:27:15,168
- Well, you understand, I
am responsible of records.

1544
01:27:17,756 --> 01:27:19,506
Perhaps an extra $50?

1545
01:27:35,260 --> 01:27:37,929
- What about your copy of
the marriage certificate?

1546
01:27:37,929 --> 01:27:41,512
- Oh, I'm sorry, I
cannot give that to you.

1547
01:27:42,409 --> 01:27:44,992
But I think I have another way.

1548
01:28:09,651 --> 01:28:11,728
- [Bob] We'd been married five days.

1549
01:28:11,728 --> 01:28:13,811
The best days of my life.

1550
01:28:15,602 --> 01:28:18,492
As we drove back to LA, we
told each other it wasn't over.

1551
01:28:18,492 --> 01:28:21,720
We must have said it a thousand times.

1552
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:24,637
And a thousand times every morning.

1553
01:28:27,003 --> 01:28:30,483
"Niagara" made Norma Jean a big star.

1554
01:28:30,483 --> 01:28:32,996
Several months later, I was
working on the set of a western

1555
01:28:32,996 --> 01:28:35,158
when I heard this story over the radio.

1556
01:28:35,158 --> 01:28:38,491
Marilyn Monroe had married Joe DiMaggio.

1557
01:28:39,476 --> 01:28:42,821
America's sex goddess
married an American hero.

1558
01:28:42,821 --> 01:28:45,816
I knew it was a wedding
Zanuck approved of.

1559
01:28:45,816 --> 01:28:48,143
But the marriage lasted only nine months.

1560
01:28:48,143 --> 01:28:51,560
And then a few weeks after their divorce.

1561
01:28:53,739 --> 01:28:54,655
- Hi.

1562
01:28:54,655 --> 01:28:55,488
- Marilyn.

1563
01:28:56,816 --> 01:28:57,860
What are you?

1564
01:28:57,860 --> 01:29:02,027
- I was in the neighborhood
and I thought I'd stop by.

1565
01:29:06,223 --> 01:29:07,973
Still there isn't it?

1566
01:29:09,562 --> 01:29:10,395
- What?

1567
01:29:10,395 --> 01:29:11,978
- That old feeling.

1568
01:29:13,792 --> 01:29:14,625
- Look.

1569
01:29:16,056 --> 01:29:16,889
Please don't.

1570
01:29:16,889 --> 01:29:18,806
- Bobby, I'm all alone.

1571
01:29:20,228 --> 01:29:22,067
And you know who I think about?

1572
01:29:22,067 --> 01:29:23,435
You.

1573
01:29:23,435 --> 01:29:25,644
Not Joe, not anyone but you.

1574
01:29:25,644 --> 01:29:26,477
This time.

1575
01:29:27,514 --> 01:29:30,264
- No, no there is no "this time."

1576
01:29:32,075 --> 01:29:35,199
It wasn't in the stars for us, Norma Jean.

1577
01:29:35,199 --> 01:29:37,191
I think I've always known that.

1578
01:29:37,191 --> 01:29:38,024
God.

1579
01:29:39,565 --> 01:29:42,075
You can make a man crazy with wanting you.

1580
01:29:42,075 --> 01:29:43,658
You're like a drug.

1581
01:29:45,976 --> 01:29:47,809
I can't do it anymore.

1582
01:29:48,842 --> 01:29:51,175
- I guess you took the cure.

1583
01:29:52,077 --> 01:29:52,910
- No.

1584
01:29:54,175 --> 01:29:55,925
No, there is no cure.

1585
01:29:58,306 --> 01:30:00,973
That's why I'll always love you.

1586
01:30:02,047 --> 01:30:04,556
- Everybody loves me, Bobby.

1587
01:30:04,556 --> 01:30:05,889
Didn't you know?

1588
01:30:36,419 --> 01:30:40,586
- [Bob] So here I was on a
brutally hot afternoon in 1962.

1589
01:30:44,679 --> 01:30:47,346
Joe took charge of the
funeral arrangements

1590
01:30:47,346 --> 01:30:49,327
and he wouldn't let anyone
from Hollywood attend

1591
01:30:49,327 --> 01:30:53,494
so we were all forced to
watch from the sidelines.

1592
01:30:54,719 --> 01:30:56,737
Maybe he was right.

1593
01:30:56,737 --> 01:30:59,320
Hollywood sure didn't save her.

1594
01:31:05,038 --> 01:31:06,871
Four of the men who
carried Norma Jean's casket

1595
01:31:06,871 --> 01:31:08,538
never even knew her.

1596
01:31:26,551 --> 01:31:27,951
Later that day, Walter Winchell

1597
01:31:27,951 --> 01:31:29,808
asked me if it was worth the heartache

1598
01:31:29,808 --> 01:31:31,925
to have married a goddess.

1599
01:31:31,925 --> 01:31:32,842
I said yes.

1600
01:31:34,730 --> 01:31:38,752
And that's when I realized
that was her special gift.

1601
01:31:38,752 --> 01:31:40,925
Up there on that screen,

1602
01:31:40,925 --> 01:31:44,632
Marilyn Monroe made all men feel love.

1603
01:31:44,632 --> 01:31:46,632
Maybe she was a goddess.

1604
01:31:47,667 --> 01:31:50,834
To me, she was my very own Norma Jean.

1605
01:31:54,136 --> 01:31:56,636
(somber jazz)
