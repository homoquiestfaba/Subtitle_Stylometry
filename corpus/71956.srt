00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:54,399
Look ,  I've already done 
 the background on this womano

158
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:58,399
all the way back to the '20s 
 when she was working as an actress.

159
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:01,399
An actress! There's 
 your first clue ,  Sherlock.

160
00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:06,399
Her name was Rose Dawson back then. 
 Then she marries this guy named Calvert.

161
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:09,399
They move to Cedar Rapids 
 and she punches out a couple of kids.

162
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:13,399
Now ,  Calvert's dead ,  and from what 
 I hear ,  Cedar Rapids is dead.

163
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:15,399
And everybody who 
 knows about the diamond

164
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:19,399
is supposed to be dead 
 or on this boat ,  but she knows.n

165
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:31,399


166
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:34,399
Doesn't exactly 
 travel light ,  does she?

167
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:36,399


168
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:39,399
Mrs. Calvert ,  I'm Brock Lovett. 
 Welcome to the Keldysh.

169
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:41,399


170
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:44,399
Okay ,  let's get her 
 inside there.

171
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:46,399
- Hi ,  Ms. Calvert. 
 - Hi.

172
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:49,399
Welcome to the Keldysh.

 Hey. Hey!

 - Rose: Yes?

176
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:03,399
- Are your staterooms all right? 
 - Rose: Oh , yes ,  very nice.

177
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:06,399
Have you met 
 my grand daughter Lizzie?e

178
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,399
She takes care of me.n

179
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:11,399
We met just 
 a few minutes ago.

180
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:13,399
Remember ,  Nana ,  up on deck?

181
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:16,399
There ,  that's nice.

182
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:19,399
Have to have my pictures 
 when I travel.b

183
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:21,399
Can I get you anything? 
 Is there anything you'd like?

184
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:23,399


185
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:25,399
Yes.g

186
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:27,399
I would like to see my drawing.


187
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:40,399


188
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:43,399
Brock: 
 Louis XVI wore a fabulous stonet

189
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:46,399
that was called 
 the Blue Diamond of the Crownl

190
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:49,399
which disappeared in 1 792

191
00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:53,399
about the same time old Louis 
 lost everything from the neck up.

192
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:57,399
The theory goes that 
 the crown diamond was chopped ,  too

193
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:01,399
recut into a heart-like shape that 
 became known as "Heart of the Ocean."

194
00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:04,399
Today it would be worth more 
 than the Hope Diamond.

195
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:08,399
It was a dreadful ,  heavy thing. 
 I only wore it this once.

196
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:12,399
Lizzie: 
 You actually think this is you ,  Nana?

197
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:16,399
It is me ,  dear. 
 Wasn't I a dish?

198
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:18,399


199
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:20,399
I tracked it down 
 through insurance records--d

200
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:24,399
An old claim that was settled 
 under terms of absolute secrecy.

201
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:26,399


202
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:28,399
Can you tell me 
 who the claimant was ,  Rose?

203
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:31,399
I should imagine 
 someone named Hockley.

204
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:35,399
Brock: Nathan Hockley ,  that's right. 
 Pittsburgh steel tycoon.

205
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:36,399


206
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:37,399
Claim was for 
 a diamond necklace

207
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:38,399


208
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:41,399
his son Caledon 
 bought his fiancée--you

209
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,500
a week before 
 he sailed on Titanic.m

210
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,500
It was filed right 
 after the sinking

211
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,500
so the diamond had to have 
 gone down with the ship.

212
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:52,399


213
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:55,400
You see the date? 

214
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,400
"April 1 4 ,  1 91 2."

215
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,400
Which means if your grandmother is 
 who she says she is

216
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,400
she was wearing the diamond 
 the day the Titanic sank.

217
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,400
And that makes you 
 my new best friend.r

218
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,400
These are some of the things 
 we recovered from your stateroom.

219
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,400


220
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,400
This was mine.

221
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,400
How extraordinary!n

222
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,400
And it looks the same as it did 
 the last time I saw it.

223
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:28,400


224
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,400
The reflection 
 has changed a bit.

225
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:35,400


226
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,400
( Gasps Quietly)

227
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:47,400


228
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,400
Are you ready to go 
 back to Titanic?p

229
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,400


230
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:58,400
Lewis: Okay ,  here we go. She hits 
 the berg on the starboard side ,  right?

231
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,400
She kind of bumps along punching holes 
 like Morse code-- dit-dit-dit--

232
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,400
along the side ,  
 below the waterline.

233
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,400
Then the forward compartments 
 start to flood.e

234
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,400
Now as the water level rises ,  it 
 spills over the watertight bulkheads

235
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,400
which unfortunately 
 don't go any higher than E deck.

236
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,400
So now as the bow goes down ,  
 the stern rises up

237
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,400
slow at first ,  then faster 
 and faster until finally

238
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,400
she's got her whole ass is sticking 
 up in the air and that's a big ass.

239
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:27,400
We're talking 
 20 , 000 ,  30 , 000 tons ,  okay?

240
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,400
And the hull's not designed to deal 
 with that pressure ,  so what happens?

241
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,500
She splits ,  
 right down to the keel

242
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,500


243
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,500
and the stern 
 falls back level.

244
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,500
Then as the bow sinks ,  it pulls the 
 stern vertical and finally detaches.

245
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,400
Now ,  the stern section just 
 kind of bobs there like a cork

246
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:50,400
for a couple of minutes ,  floods and 
 finally goes under about 2:20 a.m.

247
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,400
two hours and 40 minutes 
 after the collision.

248
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,400
The bow section planes away 
 landing about a half a mile away

249
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,400
going 20 ,  30 knots when 
 it hits the ocean floor.

00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,500
Was that the way of it?

636
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,500


637
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,500
Yeah. Yeah ,  
 that was pretty much it.u

638
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,500
Well ,  the boy's a hero then. 
 Good for you ,  son. Well done.

639
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,500
So it's all's well 
 and back to our brandy ,  eh?

640
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:22,400
Look at you. You must be freezing. 
 Let's get you inside.

641
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,400
Perhaps a little something 
 for the boy.

642
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,400


643
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:32,400
Of course. Mr. Lovejoy ,  
 I think a 20 should do it.

644
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,400
Is that the going rate 
 for saving the woman you love?

645
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:36,400


646
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:40,400
Rose is displeased. 
 What to do?

647
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,400


648
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,400
I know.o

649
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,400


650
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,400
Perhaps you could join us 
 for dinner tomorrow evening

651
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:53,400
to regale our group 
 with...your heroic tale.e

652
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,400


653
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,400
Sure ,  count me in.

654
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,400
Good. Settled then.

655
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,400
This should be interesting. Mmm.

656
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:07,400


657
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,400
( Whistles)

658
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:11,400


659
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:14,400
Can l ,  uh... bum a smoke?

660
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:23,400


661
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,400
You'll want to tie those.

662
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,400


663
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,400
It's interesting. 

664
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,400
The young lady slips so suddenly 
 and you still had time

665
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,400
to remove your jacket 
 and your shoes.

666
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:40,400


667
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,500
- ( Music Box Playing Tune) 
 - ( Knock At Door)

668
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,500
( Door Opens)


669
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,500


670
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,500
I know you've been melancholy.

671
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,500
I don't pretend to know why.

672
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,500


673
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,500
I intended to save this

674
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,500
until the engagement galat

675
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,500
next week.

676
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:10,400
But I thought tonight.

677
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:11,400


678
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,400
Good gracious.o

679
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,400
Perhaps as a reminder 
 of my feelings for you.

680
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,400
- Is it a... 
 - Diamond? Yes.

681
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,400


682
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,400
56 carats to be exact.

683
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,400


684
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,400
It was worn by Louis XVI

685
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,400
and they called it 
 "Le Coeur De La Mer. "

686
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,400
Both: 
 The Heart of the Ocean.

687
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,400
Yes.r

688
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:41,400


689
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,400
It's overwhelming..

690
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:46,400
Well ,  it's for royalty.

691
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,400
We are royalty ,  Rose.

692
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:52,400


693
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,400
You know ,  there's nothing 
 I couldn't give you.

694
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:58,400
There's nothing I'd deny you

695
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:01,400
if you would not deny me.

696
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:04,400


697
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,400
Now open your heart 
 to me ,  Rose.

698
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:22,400


699
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:25,400
Jack: Well ,  I've been on my own since 
 I was 1 5 since my folks died.

700
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,400


701
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,500
And I had no 
 brothers or sisters

702
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,500
or close kin in that part 
 of the country.

703
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,500
So I lit on out of there 
 and I haven't been back since.

704
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,500
You could just call me 
 a tumbleweed blowing in the wind.

705
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:40,500


706
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,500
Well ,  Rose...i

707
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,500
we've walked about a mile 
 around this boat deck

708
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,500
and chewed over how great 
 the weather's been and how I grew up

709
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,500
but I reckon that's not why 
 you came to talk to me ,  is it?

710
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,500


711
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,500
- Mr. Dawson ,  l-- 
 -Jack.

712
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,400
Jack...y

713
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:01,400
I want to thank you 
 for what you did.

714
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:05,400
Not just for... for pulling me back 
 but for your discretion.

715
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:06,400


716
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,400
You're welcome.

717
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:13,400
Look ,  I know 
 what you must be thinking.

718
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:17,400
Poor little rich girl. 
 What does she know about misery?

719
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:21,400
No. No ,  that's not what 
 I was thinking.

720
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:22,400


721
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,400
What I was thinking was 
 what could have happened to this girl

722
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:27,400
to make her think 
 she had no way out?e

723
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,400


724
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,400
Well ,  l--

725
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,400
It was everything.

726
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:37,400
It was my whole world 
 and all the people in it

727
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,400
and the inertia of my life 
 plunging ahead

728
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:42,400
and me ,  powerless to stop it.

729
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,400
God! Look at that thing.

730
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:47,400
You would have gone 
 straight to the bottom.

731
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:49,400


732
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,400
500 invitations have gone out.k

733
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,400
All of Philadelphia society 
 will be there

734
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,400
and all the while 
 I feel I'm...

735
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:59,400
standing in the middle 
 of a crowded room

736
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:02,400
screaming at the top of my lungs 
 and no one even looks up.

737
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:03,400


738
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:06,400
Do you love him?h

739
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:09,400
- Pardon me? 
 - Do you love him?o

740
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:12,400
You're being very rude. 
 You shouldn't be asking me this.

741
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:16,400
Well ,  it's a simple question. 
 Do you love the guy or not?

742
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:17,500


743
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,500
This is not 
 a suitable conversation.

744
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,500
-Why can't you just answer the question? 
 -( Nervous Laughter)

745
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,500
This is absurd. You don't know me ,  
 and I don't know you

746
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,500
and we are not having 
 this conversation at all.

747
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,500
You are rude and uncouth 
 and presumptuous and I am leaving now.

748
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:35,500


749
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,500
Jack. Mr. Dawson ,  
 it's been a pleasure.

750
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,500
I sought you out to thank you 
 and now I have thanked you...

751
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,500
- And you've insulted me. 
 - Well ,  you deserved it.

752
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,500
- Right. 
 - Right.n

753
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:48,400


754
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:51,400
- I thought you were leaving. 
 - I am.

755
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:52,400


756
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:55,400
You are so annoying.r

757
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:56,400
- ( Chuckles) 
 - Wait.

758
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:01,400
I don't have to leave. 
 This is my part of the ship. You leave.

759
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:03,400
Oh-ho-ho ,  
 well ,  well ,  well.

760
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,400
Now who's being rude?

761
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:09,400


762
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,400
What is this stupid thing 
 you're carrying around?o

763
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:13,400


764
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:15,400
So what are you ,  
 an artist or something?

765
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:17,400


766
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:21,400
Well ,  these are rather good.

767
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:24,400


768
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:28,400
They're ,  uh-- 
 They're very good actually.

769
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:34,400


770
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:37,400
Jack ,  this is exquisite work.

771
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:40,400
They didn't think too much 
 of them in old Paree.

772
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:45,400
Paris! You do get around 
 for a poor--y

773
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,400


774
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:50,400
Well ,  uh ,  uh ,  a person 
 of limited means.

775
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:53,400
Go on ,  a poor guy ,  
 you can say it.

776
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:55,400


777
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:58,400
Well ,  well ,  well. 

778
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,400


779
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:04,400
And these were drawn from life?

780
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:07,400


781
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,500
Well ,  that's one 
 of the good things about Paris--

782
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:10,500


783
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,500
Lots of girls willing 
 to take their clothes off.

784
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,500


785
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,500
You liked this woman.

786
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,500
You used her several times.)

787
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,500
Well ,  she had beautiful hands ,  
 you see?

788
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,500


789
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,500
I think you must have had 
 a love affair with her.

790
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,500
No ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  no. 
 Just with her hands.

791
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:35,400


792
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:37,400
She was a one-legged prostitute.c

793
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:40,400
See?l

794
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,400


795
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:46,400
- ( Aghast): Oh! 
 - ( Both Chuckle)o

796
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,400
Ah ,  she had a good sense 
 of humor ,  though.

797
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,400


798
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:53,400
Oh ,  and this lady...

799
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:56,400
she used to sit 
 at this bar every night

800
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:57,400


801
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,400
wearing every piece 
 of jewelry she owned

802
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:01,400
just waiting 
 for her long-lost love.

803
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:02,400


804
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:04,400
Called her Madame Bijou.

805
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:08,400
See how her clothes 
 are all moth-eaten?

806
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:11,400
Well ,  you have a gift ,  Jack. 

807
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:14,400
You do. You see people.

808
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:17,400
I see you.t

809
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:18,400


810
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,400
And?.

811
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:23,400
You wouldn't have jumped.

812
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:27,400


813
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:31,400
But the purpose of university 
 is to find a suitable husband.

814
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,400
Rose has already done that.

815
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,400
Look ,  here comes 
 that vulgar Brown woman.

816
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:40,400
Quickly ,  get up 
 before she sits with us.u

817
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:43,400
Hello ,  girls. I was hoping 
 I'd catch you at tea.

818
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:45,400
We're awfully sorry 
 you missed it.t

819
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:48,400
The countess and I were just off 
 to take the air on the boat deck.

820
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:51,400
What a lovely idea. 
 I need to catch up on my gossip.

821
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:55,400


822
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,500
Molly: 
 Countess. 

823
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,500
So you've not yet 
 lit the last four boilers?

824
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,500
No ,  I don't see the need. 
 We are making excellent time.

825
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,500
The press knows 
 the size of Titanic.

826
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,500
Now I want them to marvel 
 at her speed.

827
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,500
We must give them 
 something new to print.

828
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:14,500


829
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,500
This maiden voyage of Titanic 
 must make headlines.

830
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,500
Mr. Ismay ,  I would prefer 
 not to push the engines

831
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,500
until they've been 
 properly run in.

832
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:28,400
Of course 
 I'm just a passenger. 

833
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:31,400
I leave it to your good offices 
 to decide what's best.

834
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:34,400
But what a glorious end 
 to your final crossing

835
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:37,400
if we were to get into New York 
 on Tuesday night and surprise them all.

836
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:41,400
Make the morning papers. 
 Retire with a bang ,  eh ,  E.J.?

837
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:45,400


838
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,400
Good man.e

839
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:51,400
Well ,  after that I worked on 
 a squid boat in Monterey.

840
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:54,400
Then I went down to Los Angeles 
 to the pier in Santa Monica

841
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:58,400
and started doing portraits there 
 for ten cents a piece.

842
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:02,400
Why can't I be like you ,  Jack-- 
 just head out for the horizon

843
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:05,400
whenever I feel like it?

844
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:08,400
Say we'll go there 
 sometime to that pier

845
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:10,400
even if we only 
 ever just talk about it.

846
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:12,400
No ,  we'll do it.


847
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:17,400
We'll drink cheap beer. We'll ride 
 on the roller coaster till we throw up.

848
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:20,400
Then we'll ride horses on the beach 
 right in the surf.

849
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:24,400
But you'll have to do it like a real 
 cowboy. None of that sidesaddle stuff.

850
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:28,400
- You mean ,  one leg on each side? 
 - Yeah.

851
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:32,400
- Can you show me? 
 - Sure... if you like.

852
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:33,400


853
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:38,400
- Teach me to ride like a man. 
 - And chew tobacco like a man.

854
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:40,400
And spit like a man.

855
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:42,400
They didn't teach you that 
 in finishing school?

856
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,500
- No. 
 - Well ,  come on ,  I'll show you.

857
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,500
Let's do it. 
 I'll show you how. Come on.

Come on ,  you really got 
 to hawk it back ,  you know?

-That was better. You got to work on it. 
 -Really?

about the man 
 who had saved my life

 like an insect--

 which must be squashed quickly.

 what you're doing?

Not really.

 - Well ,  hello ,  Molly. Nice to see you.

957

 I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson.

00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:53,400
- How Do you do? 
 - Pleasure.

959
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:56,400
Hello ,  Jack. 
 Are you of the Boston Dawsons?

960
00:56:56,900 --> 00:57:00,400
No-- the Chippewa Falls Dawsons ,  
 actually.

961
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:02,400
Oh ,  yes. Yes.a

962
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:03,400


963
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:08,400
He must have been nervous ,  
 but he never faltered.

964
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:10,400
They assumed 
 he was one of them--

965
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:14,400
Heir to a rail road fortune ,  
 perhaps.

966
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:19,400
New money ,  obviously ,  
 but still a member of the club.

967

Mother ,  of course ,  
 could always be counted upon.!

 in steerage ,  Mr. Dawson.

 on this ship.

 to my fiancée last night.

974
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:44,400
It turns out that Mr. Dawson 
 is quite a fine artist.

975
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:47,400
He was kind enough to show me 
 some of his work today.

976

 She may be mine on paper

982
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,500
but in the eyes of God ,  
 she belongs to Thomas Andrews.

983

( Whispering): 
 Are these all for me?!

984

Just start from the outside 
 and work your way in.

985

He knows every rivet 
 in her ,  don't you ,  Thomas?

986

And where ,  exactly ,  
 Do you live ,  Mr. Dawson?

992
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,500
Well ,  right now ,  my address 
 is the R.M.S. Titanic.

993
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,500
After that ,

But I won my ticket 
 on Titanic here

at a lucky hand at poker.

1000
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:46,400
A very lucky hand.

1001

- All life is a game of luck. 
 - Mmm.

 his own luck ,  Archie.

- Right ,  Dawson? 
 - Mmm.

1004
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:58,400

Got air in my lungs 
 and a few blank sheets of paper.

1009
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:13,400

 not knowing what's going to happen

1010
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:17,400
or who I'm going to meet ,  
 where I'm going to wind up.

1011
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:21,400
Just the other night ,  I was sleeping 
 under a bridge ,  and now here I am

01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:53,500


1112
01:05:53,899 --> 01:05:55,399
Ow! 
 ( Laughing)

1113
01:05:55,899 --> 01:05:58,399
-Jesus ,  Mary and Joseph! 
 - You all right?

1114
01:05:58,899 --> 01:06:01,399
I haven't done that in years.

1115
01:06:01,899 --> 01:06:08,399


1116
01:06:08,899 --> 01:06:11,399
Go see Maggie ,  lads. 
 Give her the holley! Let's go!

1117
01:06:11,899 --> 01:06:14,399
Musicians: 
 Ho! 

1118
01:06:14,899 --> 01:06:37,399


1119
01:06:37,899 --> 01:06:39,399
Coffee ,  sir? 

1120
01:06:39,899 --> 01:06:47,399


1121
01:06:47,899 --> 01:06:50,399
I had hoped you would 
 come to me last night.

1122
01:06:50,899 --> 01:06:52,399


1123
01:06:52,899 --> 01:06:55,399
I was tired. 

1124
01:06:55,899 --> 01:06:56,399


1125
01:06:56,899 --> 01:06:59,399
Your exertions below decks 
 were no doubt exhausting.

1126
01:06:59,899 --> 01:07:01,399


1127
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:06,500
I see you had that undertaker 
 of a manservant follow me. How typical.

1128
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,500
You will never behave like that 
 again ,  Rose. Do you understand?

1129
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,500


1130
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,500
I'm not a foreman in one 
 of your mills that you can command.

1131
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,500
I'm your fiancée.k

1132
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,500


1133
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,500
My fiancée? 
 My fiancée?!!

1134
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,500
Yes ,  you are ,  and my wife!a

1135
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,500


1136
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,500
My wife in practice if not yet by law ,  
 so you will honor me.

1137
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,500
You will honor me the way a wife 
 is required to honor a husband.

1138
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,500
Because I will not be 
 made out a fool ,  Rose.

1139
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,500
Is this in anyway unclear?e

1140
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,500
- No. 
 - Good.

1141
01:07:42,899 --> 01:07:44,399
Excuse me.

1142
01:07:44,899 --> 01:07:49,399


1143
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:51,399
Miss Rose!e

1144
01:07:51,899 --> 01:07:52,399


1145
01:07:52,899 --> 01:07:55,399
- We had a little... accident. 
 - That's all right ,  Miss Rose.

1146
01:07:55,899 --> 01:07:57,399
- That's all right. 
 - I'm sorry ,  Trudy.

1147
01:07:57,899 --> 01:08:00,399
Let me help you. 
 It's all right ,  miss.

1148
01:08:00,899 --> 01:08:06,399


1149
01:08:06,899 --> 01:08:08,399
It's all right ,  miss.s

1150
01:08:08,899 --> 01:08:13,399


1151
01:08:13,899 --> 01:08:16,399
- Tea ,  Trudy. 
 - Yes ,  ma'am.

1152
01:08:16,899 --> 01:08:32,399


1153
01:08:32,899 --> 01:08:36,399
You're not to see that boy again ,  
 Do you understand me?

1154
01:08:36,899 --> 01:08:41,399
- Rose ,  I forbid it. 
 - Oh ,  stop it ,  Mother.

1155
01:08:41,899 --> 01:08:43,399
You'll give yourself 
 a nosebleed.

1156
01:08:43,899 --> 01:08:45,399
This is not a game.b

1157
01:08:45,899 --> 01:08:49,399
Our situation is precarious. 
 You know the money's gone.

1158
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,500
Of course I know it's gone.

1159
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,500
You remind me every day.s

1160
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:00,500
Your father left us nothing but a legacy 
 of bad debts hidden by a good name.

1161
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,500
That name is the only card 
 we have to play.

1162
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,500
I don't understand you. 
 It is a fine match with Hockley.

1163
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,500
- It will ensure our survival. 
 - How can you put this on my shoulders?

1164
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:13,500


1165
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,500
- Why are you being so selfish? 
 - I'm being selfish?

1166
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,500
  

1167
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,500
Do you want to see me 
 working as a seamstress?

1168
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,500


1169
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,500
Is that what you want?

1170
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,500


1171
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,500
To see our fine things 
 sold at auction?

1172
01:09:33,899 --> 01:09:34,399


1173
01:09:34,899 --> 01:09:36,399
Our memories 
 scattered to the winds?

1174
01:09:36,899 --> 01:09:46,399


1175
01:09:46,899 --> 01:09:49,399
( Sighs) 
 It's so unfair.

1176
01:09:49,899 --> 01:09:50,399


1177
01:09:50,899 --> 01:09:53,399
Of course it's unfair. 

1178
01:09:53,899 --> 01:09:55,399
We're women.d

1179
01:09:55,899 --> 01:09:57,399


1180
01:09:57,899 --> 01:09:59,399
Our choices are never easy. 

1181
01:09:59,899 --> 01:10:06,399


1182
01:10:06,899 --> 01:10:08,399
Hmm? 

1183
01:10:08,899 --> 01:10:20,399


1184
01:10:20,899 --> 01:10:25,399
Congregation: 
 ** Protect them by Thy guardian hand **o

1185
01:10:25,899 --> 01:10:31,399
** From every peril 
 on the land. **

1186
01:10:31,899 --> 01:10:36,399
** O spirit ,  
 whom the Father sent **

1187
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:41,399
**To spread across 
 the firmament **w

1188

** O wind of heaven ,  
 by Thy might **i

1189
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:51,500

01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,500
**And keep them

1191
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,500


1192
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,500
- Hello ,  Mr. Andrews. 
 - Hello ,  Jack. 

1193
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:08,500


1194
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,500
- Sir. 
 - I need to talk to somebody for a sec.

1195
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,500
You're not supposed 
 to be in here.

1196
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,500
** ...fire and foe 
 Protect them... **

1197
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,500
I was just here last night. 
 You don't remember me?

1198
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,500
No ,  I'm afraid I don't. 
 Now you're going to have to turn around.

1199
01:11:22,899 --> 01:11:25,399
He'll tell you. 
 I just-- I just need--

1200
01:11:25,899 --> 01:11:28,399
Mr. Hockley 
 and Mrs. Dewitt Bukater

1201
01:11:28,899 --> 01:11:31,399
continue to be appreciative 
 of your assistance.o

1202
01:11:31,899 --> 01:11:35,399
They asked me to ,  uh... 
 give you this in gratitude.

1203
01:11:35,899 --> 01:11:38,399
- I don't want your money. Please ,  l-- 
 - And also to remind you...

1204
01:11:38,899 --> 01:11:40,399
that you hold 
 a third-class ticketn

1205
01:11:40,899 --> 01:11:43,399
and that your presence here 
 is no longer appropriate.

1206
01:11:43,899 --> 01:11:45,399
Please ,  I just want 
 to speak to Rose for--D

1207
01:11:45,899 --> 01:11:49,399
Gentlemen ,  will you please see that 
 Mr. Dawson gets to where he belongs

1208
01:11:49,899 --> 01:11:51,399
and that he stays there?e

1209
01:11:51,899 --> 01:11:54,399
Yes ,  sir. 
 Come along ,  you. 

1210
01:11:54,899 --> 01:11:56,399


1211
01:11:56,899 --> 01:11:59,399
** Oh ,  hear us 
 when we cry to Thee **w

1212
01:11:59,899 --> 01:12:05,399
** For those in peril 
 on the sea. **r

1213
01:12:05,899 --> 01:12:07,399
Ruth: And why Do you have 
 two steering wheels?

1214
01:12:07,899 --> 01:12:09,399
We really only use 
 this near shore.

1215
01:12:09,899 --> 01:12:12,399
Excuse me ,  sir. Another ice warning. 
 This one's from the Noordam.

1216
01:12:12,899 --> 01:12:13,399


1217
01:12:13,899 --> 01:12:15,399
Thank you ,  Sparks.

1218
01:12:15,899 --> 01:12:16,399


1219
01:12:16,899 --> 01:12:20,399
Oh ,  not to worry. 
 Quite normal for this time of year.

1220
01:12:20,899 --> 01:12:22,399
In fact ,  we're speeding up.

1221
01:12:22,899 --> 01:12:25,399
I've just ordered 
 the last boilers lit.

1222
01:12:25,899 --> 01:12:29,399


1223
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,500
Man: Okay ,  son ,  
 wind it up tight like I showed you.

1224
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,500
Okay ,  now ,  let it go.e

1225
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,500


1226
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,500
- Was good ,  wasn't it? 
 - Quite nice.

1227
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,500
That's excellent ,  son.

1228
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,500


1229
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,500
Rose: 
 Mr. Andrews ,  forgive me...

1230
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,500
I did the sum in my head 
 and with the number of lifeboats

1231
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,500
times the capacity you mentioned

1232
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,500
forgive me ,  but it seems that there 
 are not enough for everyone aboard.

1233
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,500
About half ,  actually.

1234
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:07,500
Rose ,  you miss nothing ,  Do you? 
 In fact ,  I put in these new type davits

1235
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,500
which can take an extra row 
 of boats inside this one

1236
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:10,500


1237
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:14,500
but it was thought by some 
 that the deck would look too cluttered

1238
01:13:14,899 --> 01:13:17,399
so I was overruled.u

1239
01:13:17,899 --> 01:13:20,399
Waste of deck space as it is 
 on an unsinkable ship.

1240
01:13:20,899 --> 01:13:25,399
Sleep soundly ,  young Rose. I have built 
 you a good ship ,  strong and true.

1241
01:13:25,899 --> 01:13:27,399
She's all the lifeboat you need.

1242
01:13:27,899 --> 01:13:31,399
Just keep heading aft. 
 The next stop will be the engine room.

1243
01:13:31,899 --> 01:13:33,399
Come on.r

1244
01:13:33,899 --> 01:13:35,399


1245
01:13:35,899 --> 01:13:40,399
Jack ,  this is impossible. 
 I can't see you.

1246
01:13:40,899 --> 01:13:44,399
- I need to talk to you. 
 - No ,  Jack ,  no.

1247
01:13:44,899 --> 01:13:48,399
Jack ,  I'm engaged.

1248
01:13:48,899 --> 01:13:52,399
I'm marrying Cal. 
 I love Cal.

1249
01:13:52,899 --> 01:13:54,399


1250
01:13:54,899 --> 01:13:58,399
Rose ,  you're no picnic.

1251
01:13:58,899 --> 01:14:01,399
All right ,  you're a spoiled 
 little brat ,  even

1252
01:14:01,899 --> 01:14:05,399
but under that you're the most 
 amazingly astounding

1253
01:14:05,899 --> 01:14:06,399


1254
01:14:06,899 --> 01:14:10,399
wonderful girl-- woman-- 
 that I've ever known and...

1255
01:14:10,899 --> 01:14:12,399
-Jack ,  l... 
 - No ,  let me try and get this out.

1256
01:14:12,899 --> 01:14:16,399
You're , you're ama--

1257
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,500
I'm not an idiot. 
 I know how the world works.

1258
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:20,500


1259
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:21,500
I've got ten bucks 
 in my pocket.

1260
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:22,500


1261
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,500
I have nothing to offer you 
 and I know that.

1262
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,500
I understand.e

1263
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,500
But I'm too involved now. 
 You jump ,  I jump ,  remember?

1264
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:36,500
I can't turn away 
 without knowing you'll be all right.

1265
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,500
That's all that I want.

1266
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,500
Well ,  I'm fine.

1267
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,500
I'll be fine ,  really.

1268
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,500
Really?

1269
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,500


1270
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,500
I don't think so. 
 They've got you trapped ,  Rose

1271
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:53,500


1272
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:54,500
and you're going to die 
 if you don't break free--

1273
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,500
Maybe not right away 
 because you're strong ,  but

1274
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,500
sooner or later that fire 
 that I love about you ,  Rose...

1275
01:15:02,899 --> 01:15:04,399
that fire is going to burn out.

1276
01:15:04,899 --> 01:15:09,399


1277
01:15:09,899 --> 01:15:11,399
It's not up to you 
 to save me , Jack.

1278
01:15:11,899 --> 01:15:13,399


1279
01:15:13,899 --> 01:15:18,399
You're right. 
 Only you can do that.

1280
01:15:18,899 --> 01:15:24,399


1281
01:15:24,899 --> 01:15:27,399
I'm going back. 
 Leave me alone.

1282
01:15:27,899 --> 01:15:38,399


1283
01:15:38,899 --> 01:15:42,399
Countess: Tell Lucille about the 
 disaster you had with the stationer's.

1284
01:15:42,899 --> 01:15:45,399
Well ,  of course ,  the invitations 
 had to be sent back twice.

1285
01:15:45,899 --> 01:15:48,399
- Oh ,  my dear! 
 - And the dreadful bridesmaid's gowns--

1286
01:15:48,899 --> 01:15:50,399
Let me tell you what an odyssey 
 that has been.

1287
01:15:50,899 --> 01:15:54,399
Rose decided 
 she wanted lavender.

1288
01:15:54,899 --> 01:15:57,399
She knows I detest the color ,  
 so she did it only to spite me.

1289
01:15:57,899 --> 01:15:59,399
Lucille: 
 If only you'd come to me sooner.

1290
01:15:59,899 --> 01:16:02,399
Ruth saw some of my designs 
 in "La Mode Illustree."

1291
01:16:02,899 --> 01:16:06,399
They were for Trousseau of the Duchess 
 of Malborough's youngest daughter.

1292
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,500
Theyw ere quite charming ,  but I think 
 you'll agree ,  my dear ,  that together

1293
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,500
we've created something of a phoenix 
 from the ashes.

1294
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,500
( Women Laugh Politely)

1295
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:27,500


1296
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,500
Hello , Jack.

1297
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:34,500


1298
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,500
I changed my mind.

1299
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:41,500


1300
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,500
- They said you might be-- 
 - Shh.

1301
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:44,500


1302
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,500
Give me your hand.

1303
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:55,500


1304
01:16:55,899 --> 01:16:57,399
Now close your eyes.

1305
01:16:57,899 --> 01:16:59,399
Go on.

1306
01:16:59,899 --> 01:17:01,399


1307
01:17:01,899 --> 01:17:04,399
Step up.

1308
01:17:04,899 --> 01:17:07,399


1309
01:17:07,899 --> 01:17:09,399
Now hold on to the railing.

1310
01:17:09,899 --> 01:17:12,399
- Keep your eyes closed ,  don't peek. 
 - I'm not.

1311
01:17:12,899 --> 01:17:13,399


1312
01:17:13,899 --> 01:17:16,399
Step up onto the rail.

1313
01:17:16,899 --> 01:17:19,399


1314
01:17:19,899 --> 01:17:23,399
Hold on. Hold on. 
 Keep your eyes closed.

1315
01:17:23,899 --> 01:17:26,399
- ( Giggles) 
 - Do you trust me?

1316
01:17:26,899 --> 01:17:28,399
I trust you.

1317
01:17:28,899 --> 01:17:37,399


1318
01:17:37,899 --> 01:17:41,399
All right ,  open your eyes.

1319
01:17:41,899 --> 01:17:47,399


1320
01:17:47,899 --> 01:17:50,399
I'm flying! Jack!

1321
01:17:50,899 --> 01:18:14,399


1322
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,500
( Softly): 
 ** Come , Josephine ,  my flying machine **

1323
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,500
** Going up ,  she goes **

1324
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,500
** Up ,  she goes... **

1325
01:18:25,000 --> 01:19:11,500


1326
01:19:11,899 --> 01:19:14,399
That was the last time Titanic 
 ever saw daylight.

1327
01:19:14,899 --> 01:19:18,399
So we're up to dusk 
 the night of the sinking.

1328
01:19:18,899 --> 01:19:21,399
- Six hours to go. 
 - Incredible.

1329
01:19:21,899 --> 01:19:23,399
There's Smith and he's standing there 
 and he's got the iceberg warning...

1330
01:19:23,899 --> 01:19:28,399
in his fucking hand-- excuse me-- 
 his hand ,  and he's ordering more speed.

1331
01:19:28,899 --> 01:19:31,399
26years of experience 
 working against him.

1332
01:19:31,899 --> 01:19:33,399
He figures anything big enough 
 to sink the ship

1333
01:19:33,899 --> 01:19:35,399
they're going to see 
 in time to turn

1334
01:19:35,899 --> 01:19:38,399
but the ship's too big 
 with too small a rudder.

1335
01:19:38,899 --> 01:19:41,399
Doesn't corner worth a damn.

1336
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,500
Everything he knows is wrong.

1337
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:56,500


1338
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,500
( Laughing) 
 It's quite proper ,  I assure you.

1339
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,500
This is the sitting room.

1340
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,500
- Will this light do? 
 - What?

1341
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,500
Don't artists need good light?

1342
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,500
( In French Accent): 
 That is true

1343
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,500
but I'm not used to working 
 in such horrible conditions.

1344
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,500
Monet!

1345
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,500
- Do you know his work? 
 - Of course.

1346
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,500
Look at his use of color here. 
 Isn't he great?

1347
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,500
I know ,  it's extraordinary.

1348
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,500


1349
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,500
Cal insists on carting 
 this hideous thing everywhere.

1350
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,500
Should we be expecting him 
 anytime soon?

1351
01:20:31,899 --> 01:20:35,399
Not as long as the cigars 
 and brandy hold out.

1352
01:20:35,899 --> 01:20:37,399


1353
01:20:37,899 --> 01:20:41,399
- That's nice. 
 - What is it ,  a sapphire?

1354
01:20:41,899 --> 01:20:45,399
A diamond ,  
 a very rare diamond.

1355
01:20:45,899 --> 01:20:49,399


1356
01:20:49,899 --> 01:20:54,399
Jack ,  I want you to draw me like one 
 of your French girls... wearing this.

1357
01:20:54,899 --> 01:20:57,399
All right.

1358
01:20:57,899 --> 01:20:59,399
Wearing only this.

1359
01:20:59,899 --> 01:21:34,399


1360
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,500
The last thing I need 
 is another picture of me

1361
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,500
Looking like a porcelain doll.

1362
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,500


1363
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,500
As a paying customer...

1364
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,500


1365
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,500
I expect to get what I want.

1366
01:21:50,000 --> 01:22:06,500


1367
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,500
Over on the bed-- 
 the couch.

1368
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:17,500


1369
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,500
Go... Lie down.

1370
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,500


1371
01:22:23,899 --> 01:22:26,399
- Tell me when it looks right. 
 - Put your arm back the way it was.

1372
01:22:26,899 --> 01:22:28,399
Right.

1373
01:22:28,899 --> 01:22:32,399
Put that other arm up ,  
 that hand right by your face there.

1374
01:22:32,899 --> 01:22:33,399


1375
01:22:33,899 --> 01:22:35,399
Right.

1376
01:22:35,899 --> 01:22:36,399


1377
01:22:36,899 --> 01:22:38,399
Now ,  head down.

1378
01:22:38,899 --> 01:22:40,399


1379
01:22:40,899 --> 01:22:42,399
Eyes to me ,  
 keep them on me.

1380
01:22:42,899 --> 01:22:44,399


1381
01:22:44,899 --> 01:22:46,399
And try to stay still.

1382
01:22:46,899 --> 01:22:49,399


1383
01:22:49,899 --> 01:22:51,399
( Exhales)

1384
01:22:51,899 --> 01:23:05,399


1385
01:23:05,899 --> 01:23:07,399
So serious.

1386
01:23:07,899 --> 01:23:48,399


1387
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:52,500
I believe you are blushing ,  
 Mr. Big Artiste.

1388
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:56,500


1389
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,500
I can't imagine 
 Monsieur Monet blushing.

1390
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,500
He does landscapes. 
 Just relax your face.

1391
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,500
- Sorry. 
 - No laughing.

1392
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,500
( Exhales)

1393
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:37,500


1394
01:24:37,899 --> 01:24:41,399
My heart was pounding 
 the whole time.

1395
01:24:41,899 --> 01:24:45,399
It was the most erotic moment 
 of my life.

1396
01:24:45,899 --> 01:24:48,399


1397
01:24:48,899 --> 01:24:51,399
Up until then ,  at least.

1398
01:24:51,899 --> 01:24:57,399
- So what happened next? 
 - You mean ,  did we do it?

1399
01:24:57,899 --> 01:24:59,399


1400
01:24:59,899 --> 01:25:01,399
Sorry ,  to disappoint you ,  
 Mr. Bodine.

1401
01:25:01,899 --> 01:25:04,399
Jack was very professional.

1402
01:25:04,899 --> 01:25:12,399


1403
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,500
Thank you.

1404
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:16,500


1405
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,500
( Rose Laughing)

1406
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,500


1407
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,500
What you doing?

1408
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,500
Will you put this back 
 in the safe for me?

1409
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:26,500


1410
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:27,500
Mm-hmm.

1411
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:38,500


1412
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,500
Would you excuse me?

1413
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,500


1414
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:47,500
- None of the stewards have seen her. 
 - This is absurd.

1415
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,500
It's a ship ,  there's only 
 so many places she could be.

1416
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,500
Lovejoy ,  find her.

1417
01:25:53,000 --> 01:26:10,500


1418
01:26:10,899 --> 01:26:12,399
- Clear. 
 - Yes.

1419
01:26:12,899 --> 01:26:17,399
I don't think I've ever seen 
 such a flat calm.

1420
01:26:17,899 --> 01:26:21,399
Like a mill pond. 
 Not a breath of wind.

1421
01:26:21,899 --> 01:26:25,399
It will make the bergs 
 harder to see

1422
01:26:25,899 --> 01:26:29,399
with no breaking water 
 at the base.

1423
01:26:29,899 --> 01:26:31,399
Hmm.

1424
01:26:31,899 --> 01:26:38,399


1425
01:26:38,899 --> 01:26:43,399
Well ,  I'm off. Maintain speed 
 and heading ,  Mr. Lightoller.

1426
01:26:43,899 --> 01:26:45,399
Yes ,  sir.

1427
01:26:45,899 --> 01:26:56,399


1428
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,500
It's getting cold. 
 You look nice.

1429

1597
01:39:19,899 --> 01:39:21,399
( Ringing)

1598
01:39:21,899 --> 01:39:24,399


1599
01:39:24,899 --> 01:39:26,399
Find the carpenter. 
 Get him to sound the ship.

1600
01:39:26,899 --> 01:39:28,399
Yes ,  sir!

1601
01:39:28,899 --> 01:39:31,399


1602
01:39:31,899 --> 01:39:34,399
Fabrizio: 
 Porcaputtana!

1603
01:39:34,899 --> 01:39:36,399
Che cazzo e?

1604
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,500


1605
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:42,500
Come on ,  let's get the hell 
 out of here! Come on ,  hurry up.

1606
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:47,500


1607
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,500
Excuse me. Why have the engines stopped? 
 I felt a shudder.

1608
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,500
I shouldn't worry ,  madam. 
 We've likely thrown a propeller blade.

1609
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,500
That's the shudder you felt. 
 May I bring you anything?

1610
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,500
No ,  thank you.

1611
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:03,500


1612
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,500
Man: 
 Did you see anything?

1613
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,500
Man: 
 I don't see anything now ,  Do you?

1614
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,500
( Commotion)

1615
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:13,500
If this is the direction the rats 
 are going that's good enough for me.

1616
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,500


1617
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,500
Crewman: Please ,  sir ,  please. 
 Everything's under control.

1618
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:19,500


1619
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,500
- You there. 
 - Sir ,  there is no emergency.
