8
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,240
It's in the center of the circle in
Kingfisher County, moving north.

9
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,560
Tornado warning continues now
and has been extended officially.

10
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,400
I gave this to you earlier.
It's extended over into Oklahoma Cou--

11
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,240
They're calling all of
Oklahoma County right now....

12
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,080
Jo.

13
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,880
-What is it, Mommy?
-We have to get up.

14
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,040
We must go to the storm cellar!

15
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,400
What's happening?

16
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,840
Come on, sweetie.

17
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,200
Hurry!

18
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,640
Mommy's got you.

19
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,480
TV says it's big.

20
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,560
We're going to the storm cellar.

21
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,200
We must move! Hand her to me!

22
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,360
Come on! Let's move.

23
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,240
Go to the center of your
house if there's no cellar.

24
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,600
My Lord!

25
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,760
Come on!

26
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,840
We're almost there!

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,360
Take her! Take her!

28
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,400
I'll get the door!

29
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,840
-Get in!
-Hurry!

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,120
It's coming!

31
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,240
Quick!

32
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,480
Light the lamp!

33
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,920
Daddy! Toby's still outside!

34
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,760
Toby, come on, boy!

35
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,720
Good boy!

36
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,040
It's okay, Toby.

37
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,680
Grab Jo!

38
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,560
Daddy!

39
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,600
Take Jo!

40
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,240
God!

41
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,720
I can't hold it.

42
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,120
Jesus! Oh, God!

43
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,600
I can't hold it!

44
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,520
Stay with me, Jo!

45
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,920
At 7 a.m. in Oklahoma City,
the temperature is 75 degrees.

46
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,320
Look, caps are already
starting to break.

47
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,720
All the models are forecasting
lifted indices from -6 to -10.

48
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,960
If the cells keep building, there could be
a record outbreak of tornados.

49
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,600
This is going to be a long day.

50
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,800
Are you sure she'll be there?

51
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,400
If I know Jo, she's already dragged
her department into the field.

52
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,640
Day like today, it's to be expected.
She forgets everything except work.

53
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,280
You're nervous.

54
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,320
Nervous?

55
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,560
No.

56
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,320
Do I look nervous?

57
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,520
No.

58
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,320
Well, yeah, you do a little. You know.

59
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,880
I want to get it over with.

60
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,960
She said she signed the papers?

61
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,040
That's what she said.

62
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,600
You don't think so?

63
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,840
I think so.

64
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,440
Give me a kiss.

65
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,560
Okay, Professor! Hang on there.
I think I fixed it.

66
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,200
I got it.

67
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,600
Fuck me! This thing is useless!

68
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,720
Sorry!

69
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,520
Wait, wait!

70
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,480
Good! Give me a reading!

71
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,240
Okay, boss lady, hold your horses.

72
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,360
Which way do you want it?

73
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,280
The dry line is stalled.

74
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,080
Scan WNW, look at mid-levels for
rotation, and increase the P.R.F.

75
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,240
If I mistreat you girl

76
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,560
Sure don't mean no harm

77
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,840
All I'm saying is, don't fold the maps.

78
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,360
I didn't.

79
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,400
Kansas is a mess. There's a
big crease through Wichita.

80
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,080
Roll the maps.

81
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,000
The storm chasers.

82
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,640
Who's that handsome devil?

83
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,680
Gentlemen.

84
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,680
The Extreme! It's the Extreme!

85
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,800
Don't start that shit.

86
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:55,000
A manly handshake ensues.
How you doing, man?

87
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,240
I'm doing great.

88
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,840
Oh, man!

89
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,160
I'd like you to meet Melissa.
This is Dusty.

90
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,240
Dustman's been chasing
with us since we started.

91
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,160
Listen...

92
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,600
...where's Jo?

93
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,640
She's by the Doppler.

94
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,960
Broke down again.
Running out of grant money.

95
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,800
Why don't you hang out here for a
little while. I'll be right back.

96
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,400
Dusty, why don't you
explain to Melissa...

97
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,960
...why you're the way you are.

98
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,000
Come on.

99
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,400
Man, Jo's going to wig
when she sees he's back.

100
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm not back.

101
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,840
The prodigal son returns.

102
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,920
Hi, Joey.

103
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,680
Hiya, Jo.

104
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,680
I'm happy you found us.

105
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,200
How you doing?

106
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,760
It's going good.

107
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,360
You see the sky today?

108
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,720
She's really talking.

109
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,920
Catch.

110
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,360
It's the biggest series of storms in
12 years. One lined up after another.

111
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,440
N.S.S.L.'s never seen anything like it.

112
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,920
Is that right? So, Jo,
about the divorce papers--

113
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,320
Do you have a sec?

114
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,600
Excuse me.

115
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,320
This thing's acting up again.

116
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,080
The focus mount's jammed.

117
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,600
There's grass in the auto-focus.

118
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,160
Should I clean it?

119
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,480
Not unless you want to sketch tornados.

120
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,920
Welcome back.

121
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,480
I'm not back.

122
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,640
You want the papers?

123
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,960
I came here for them.

124
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,680
They're signed and ready.

125
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,520
Good. Let's see them.

126
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,120
Right now?

127
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,320
That'd be nice.

128
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,280
What's the urgent urgency?
You act like you're getting married.

129
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,480
I am.

130
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,760
Is it Melinda?

131
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,640
Melissa.

132
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,480
Wasn't there a Melinda somewhere?

133
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,720
There's only been Melissa since you.

134
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,880
Not much for browsing, are you?

135
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,560
I guess I'm not.

136
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,560
There you go.

137
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,280
You missed a page.

138
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,040
Right here.

139
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,920
Where'd this come from?

140
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,960
What're you doing?

141
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,520
Can I read it first?

142
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,320
It's the same as December.

143
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,680
I didn't read it then.

144
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,640
Christ, would you sign it
so we can get out of here?

145
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,560
Please.

146
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,400
"We?" She's here?

147
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,360
She's with Dusty. Now,
please, sign the document.

148
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,320
With Dusty? What's wrong with you?

149
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,600
I want to meet her.

150
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,960
No, you don't.

151
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,520
Christ.

152
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,880
The suck zone.

153
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,520
It's the point...

154
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,040
...basically at which the twister...

155
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,480
...sucks you up.

156
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,160
That's not the technical
term for it, obviously.

157
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm Jo Harding.

158
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,840
Nice to meet you.

159
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,520
Bill told me the happy news.

160
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,480
-Which?
-Us. Marriage. Jo, Melissa.

161
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,760
It's happy news.

162
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,560
I guess it seems sudden.

163
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,760
Sudden?

164
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,640
Dude, you're taking the vows?
That's sweet.

165
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,560
We wanted to get it done before
Billy started his new job.

166
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,400
That's right. Weatherman.

167
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,520
What?

168
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,160
-Don't say it.
-I said, weatherman.

169
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,880
-It's great.
-You have that tone.

170
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,800
If you have a problem--

171
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,600
I don't have a problem
being a weatherman.

172
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,480
Dr. Melissa Reeves.

173
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,520
Very nice to meet you.

174
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,880
You too.

175
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,200
New truck?

176
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,040
That's right.

177
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,600
Boy, oh, boy. New job...

178
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,360
...new truck...

179
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,600
...new wife. It's a whole new you.

180
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,280
This is awkward.

181
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,480
Tell me.

182
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,400
I thought you'd come alone.

183
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,800
You said you'd meet me--

184
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,320
It's about Dorothy.

185
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,840
Dorothy?

186
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,600
What about her?

187
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,080
She's here.

188
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,800
Show me.

189
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,560
I can't believe you did it.

190
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,080
We built 4.

191
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,040
She work?

192
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,960
Thought you'd want to be
here for her first time out.

193
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,680
It wouldn't be right
if you weren't here.

194
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,560
This is going to be good!

195
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,360
How sweet is that?

196
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,320
It's Bill's concept.

197
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,720
The Extreme. It came from his brain.

198
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,480
I had a hand in it.

199
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,120
It is great.

200
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,960
What is it?

201
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,400
It's an instrument pack for studying
tornados. First one in history.

202
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,840
It's very exciting.

203
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,560
Scientists have studied
tornados forever...

204
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,120
...but nobody knows
how a tornado works.

205
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,200
We don't know what happens inside...

206
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,280
...because nobody can take
measurements inside the funnel.

207
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,600
That's what she's going to do.

208
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,400
How?

209
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,200
We put her up inside a tornado.

210
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:00,920
She opens...

211
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,320
...and releases hundreds
of these sensors...

212
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,520
...that measure all parts of
the tornado simultaneously.

213
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,320
You see, it's like this:

214
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,080
These sensors go up the funnel
and radio back information...

215
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,760
...about the internal structure,
wind velocities....

216
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,640
We'll learn more in 30 seconds
than in the last 30 years.

217
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,560
Get a profile for the first time.

218
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,160
What will that do?

219
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,920
If we know how tornados work,
we can design a warning system.

220
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,000
Aren't there warnings already?

221
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,720
-The civil defense--
-They're not good enough.

222
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,400
Right now it's 3 minutes.

223
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,160
If we can get this information,
we can increase it to 15.

224
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,400
Give people a chance to get to safety.

225
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,960
That's what they're trying to do.

226
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,720
I can't believe you did it.

227
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,560
Well, we did it.

228
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,080
How do you get it in?

229
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,720
You get in front of it and
put it in the damage path.

230
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,560
And then get out again quickly.

231
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,800
That's the suck zone.

232
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,400
Excellent! We got major action!

233
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,320
N.S.S.L. says the cap is breaking,
towers are going up 30 miles.

234
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,760
Let's go.

235
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,080
We're moving!

236
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,120
It's fatty time!

237
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,640
Laptop.

238
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,800
We're waiting! Let's go!

239
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,280
Joey, Haynes, a little help!

240
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,440
Smooth.

241
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,080
There's Dusty!

242
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,640
Come on! You're always last!
Let's go!

243
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,760
We're going third. Preacher follow.

244
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,120
Get the camera!

245
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,080
I got it!

246
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,680
They can handle this.
They know what they're doing.

247
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,760
This is what they do.

248
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,760
They live for this.

249
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,600
Dorothy 2 & 3 ready.

250
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,800
Dorothy 4 ready.

251
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,880
Sure you don't want to go?

252
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,680
Go with them?

253
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,520
No, they'll be fine.

254
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,280
-Did she sign the papers?
-Shit!

255
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,440
She didn't?

256
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,440
Hurry. We can catch them!

257
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,440
Glad you're back!

258
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,960
I'm not back!

259
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,080
Rabbit.

260
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,440
Yeah, boss?

261
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,320
Can we do better than the 30?

262
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,680
Not for a while. It's best to stay
on it until we pass the creek.

263
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,960
Copy that.

264
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,680
Once we catch up to them,
take the truck and go home.

265
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,120
I'll get them signed, see you tonight.

266
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,840
This is interesting.
I'm going to tag along.

267
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,560
Jonas! Son-of-a-bitch!

268
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,400
Who is that?

269
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,200
Jonas Miller. He's a night crawler.

270
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:17,160
We all started out in the same lab, then
Jonas got himself corporate sponsors.

271
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,120
He's in it for the money,
not the science.

272
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,440
He's got a lot of high-tech gadgets.

273
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,040
But he's got no instincts.

274
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,640
And he doesn't have Dorothy.

275
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,960
I think we have fleas.

276
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,680
Jo, come back.

277
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,000
You change your mind?

278
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,000
Yeah. Why's Jonas here?

279
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,200
I'm not sure.

280
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,920
I bet he's asking himself
the same thing about you.

281
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,120
Shit! Hold on!

282
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,480
God damn! Son-of-a-bitch!

283
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,760
This essentially was a false alarm.

284
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,480
The radar appeared solid.

285
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,520
-How long till it's fixed?
-10 minutes, 15 tops.

286
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,880
Sounds good.

287
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,000
What drives me is the unknown.

288
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,720
What if we could predict
the tornado's path?

289
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,440
How many lives would be spared
by an early warning system?

290
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,680
And D.O.T. 3...

291
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,880
...is the answer.

292
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,840
The first digital
orthographic telemeter.

293
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,200
Inside, she holds hundreds
of these sensors which...

294
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:50,000
...when released into the tornado,
transmit back data on wind speed...

295
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,520
...pressure and dew point temperature.

296
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,160
Why didn't you tell me?

297
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,200
Don't.

298
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,280
And what will soon be the
center for all studies.

299
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,880
You shit!

300
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,640
Think I wouldn't find out?!

301
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,000
Get him off me!

302
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,560
What's wrong?

303
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,840
What's the matter?

304
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,560
You stole my design, you bastard!

305
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,920
What do you mean?!

306
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,880
Dorothy. You took her, you damn thief!

307
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,240
Oh, I get it. You want to
take credit for my design.

308
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,520
You're a liar.

309
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,600
She was our idea.

310
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,840
Unrealized idea.

311
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:28,800
Unrealized.

312
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,120
That ain't worth shit unless it flies!

313
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,120
Guys! Guys! All my guys,
get a grip on yourself.

314
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,960
We both know he'll never
get it up in the air.

315
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,600
Well, let me enlighten you people!

316
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,160
This baby has satellite comlink.

317
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,720
We got on-board pulse Doppler.

318
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,560
We got Nexrad real time.

319
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,560
We're going to make history.

320
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,960
So stick around.

321
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,400
The days of sniffing the dirt are over.

322
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,840
Better than what you sniff.

323
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,160
We'll see who gets there first, pal.

324
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,920
By the way...

325
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,640
...I really enjoy your weather reports.

326
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,720
You slime!

327
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,400
Come here!

328
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,960
Get off!

329
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,800
He's a corporate kiss-butt.

330
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,600
I'm sorry. I should have told you.

331
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,520
One day.

332
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,360
I'll give you one day.
Whether she flies or not, I'm gone.

333
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,640
Honey?

334
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,400
Is everything okay?

335
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,240
-Everything's fine.
-Are you sure?

336
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,240
Yeah, everything's okay.

337
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,040
I'm going to hang out here.
Why don't you get us some cold drinks?

338
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,640
Okay, sweetheart.

339
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,760
Jo, I don't know what's wrong
with Bill. He's wacko. He's crazy.

340
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,520
You ought to get a leash on him.

341
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,280
He's your problem, not mine.

342
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:20,040
This storm's going to be a lot
bigger than we anticipated.

343
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,920
I got reports of mesos from
Grand County to Logan.

344
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,720
Sharing information with me?

345
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,800
No, I was curious as to which
way you were going to head.

346
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Southeast, I think.

347
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,440
To the counter.

348
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,160
Two lemonades to go, please.

349
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,760
-Nothing changes.
-Pardon me?

350
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,040
He'll wait and see what Bill does.

351
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,880
May I have a coffee to go?

352
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,600
That man is waiting for Bill?
Why?

353
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:22,280
You're telling me that Billy
knows what a storm is thinking?

354
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,360
Something like that. Gum?

355
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,440
My aunt called him a human barometer.

356
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,720
He hasn't really told me about all this.

357
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:36,280
If you must pee, do it now. There's not
many places to stop on the road.

358
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,440
You're still in love with him.

359
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,840
Check, please.

360
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,920
Not that I blame you.

361
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,840
I hope this isn't a desperate
attempt to keep him in your life.

362
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,640
We're together.

363
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,200
Hey, man.

364
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,800
What's up?

365
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,160
Going green.

366
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,840
Greenage.

367
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,880
-Saddle them up.
-You got it, boss.

368
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,160
I need a sector scan on that cell.
Keep looking for a hook.

369
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,320
What are my dew points doing?

370
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,920
Points up to 70, sir.

371
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,040
I got a lemonade.

372
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,560
We must go. Follow us in the
truck, but stay behind Dusty.

373
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,520
You'll be safe there. I must go with Jo.
Let's move out, people!

374
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,400
Where are we going?

375
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,600
Thanks, I'll drive.

376
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,040
Let's pack it up. Let's go.

377
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,320
It's a wonder of nature baby!

378
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,720
Hey, you guys!

379
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,360
Dr. Melissa Reeves here.

380
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,280
Hello, Donald.

381
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,520
No, you got me in my car.

382
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,320
Oklahoma

383
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,200
Where the wind comes
sweeping down the plain

384
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,040
And the waving wheat

385
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:23,920
This feeling of inadequacy is coming
from you. Julia doesn't resent you.

386
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,240
We've talked about this before.

387
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,880
She did not marry your penis.

388
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,800
Okay. All right.
She didn't only marry your penis.

389
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,560
So?

390
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,160
So...

391
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,640
Amazing coloring there, isn't it?

392
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,320
Look at the mammatas.

393
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,320
Those tops have got to be
spiking about 40,000 feet.

394
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,000
-It's a good thing.
-It's a very good thing.

395
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,920
You met her at the station?

396
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,800
-I don't want to fight.
-I'm not fighting. I'm talking.

397
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,360
I don't want to fight.

398
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,480
She's nice.

399
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,200
She's not nice?

400
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,280
-I know what you meant.
-You do?

401
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,640
Don't do this.

402
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,640
I'm making civilized conversation here.
You're biting my head off.

403
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,160
Jesus.

404
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,680
Yes, she's very nice.

405
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,880
No, she does not work at the station.

406
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,680
She's a therapist.

407
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:33,760
Yours?

408
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,600
You couldn't resist it.

409
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,320
I'm not saying you need therapy.

410
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,920
Wait. I need therapy?

411
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,520
I didn't say that.

412
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,440
Why would I need a therapist?

413
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,360
-I don't know.
-You're the doctor.

414
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,840
I don't know...

415
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,240
...inability to finish things.

416
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,520
Maybe rushing into things
you can't quite commit to.

417
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,880
You asked me.

418
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,160
You asked me!

419
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:00,560
Bullshit! I may have walked out, but at
Ieast I showed up in the first place!

420
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,360
-You never had an idea.
-There's a road thing going on.

421
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,080
You never knew what
being married means...

422
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:10,560
...like stability and supportiveness
and a house and neat stuff like that!

423
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,360
I'll drive.

424
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,400
Then would you?

425
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,160
Goddamn.

426
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,240
Someone should warn
her about your temper.

427
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,320
She obviously has no idea.

428
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,880
Stay out of it. I know what I'm doing.

429
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,320
What are you doing?

430
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,760
They're getting better at this.

431
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,000
You know what? If you're happy...

432
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,520
Thank you.

433
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,320
I am happy. I'm a happy person.

434
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,240
I'm happy with the way
things are going in my life.

435
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,280
-I'm happy with-with-with--
-Melissa?

436
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,520
I know her name! Yes, with Melissa.

437
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,800
You look happy.

438
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,840
I am!

439
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,080
Shit. Shit!

440
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,880
You going to wrap this up soon?

441
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,520
What?

442
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:04,600
Are we going to chase this tornado or
do you want to catch the next one?

443
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,960
Shit!

444
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,200
-Is it on the ground?
-I got it.

445
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,000
Easy.

446
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,040
Bear right. It's on an easterly course.

447
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,360
The Weather Service has issued
a tornado warning till 11 a.m.

448
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,160
Dr. Miller?

449
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,160
I think they turned left.

450
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,840
Do it.

451
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,240
We'll intercept. Get ready to set up.

452
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,640
You got it.

453
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,800
-Get further ahead of it.
-I know what I'm doing.

454
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,120
Cut across.

455
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,520
-Get into that field.
-I'll get ahead of it.

456
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,920
Want to drive?

457
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,480
-Would you like to drive?
-I'd love to.

458
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,080
Distances are about 3 miles southeast.
Let's see what she does.

459
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,920
Go in there.

460
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,360
You'll miss it.

461
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,040
Hold on a second.

462
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,960
Lost your nerve?

463
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,720
Tighten your seat belt.

464
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,600
Where are you? We lost visual.

465
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,960
Having fun?

466
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,640
We must get out of this.

467
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,760
Really?

468
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,440
2 miles. Picking up speed.

469
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,960
Sometime this week would be good.

470
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,160
I'm trying.

471
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,840
You mad?

472
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,480
I will be later. Now I'm
trying not to kill us.

473
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:01,280
Funnel's getting thicker!
It's moving fast! Coming towards you!

474
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,600
It's turning!

475
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,440
-I can't see it.
-You will!

476
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,240
You're too close! It won't work!
Get out!

477
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,240
Oh, shit!

478
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,000
It's too steep.

479
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,280
This was a great idea!

480
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,840
That wasn't so bad. Let's go!

481
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,560
Why can't we spend a
normal day together?

482
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,040
We're in the damage path!
This is crazy! Forget it!

483
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,320
-No, it's going to hit us!
-We can still do this!

484
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,280
There's no time! Come on! Come on!

485
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,720
Grab hold of something!

486
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,240
I know!

487
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,120
What are you doing?!

488
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,960
I want to see it!

489
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,720
Come back!

490
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,600
Come on!

491
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,320
Look out!

492
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,560
Oh, God.

493
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,880
Oh, my God!

494
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,200
It's gone.

495
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,240
It's gone.

496
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,040
Where's my truck?

497
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,680
There it is.

498
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,320
Oh, God!

499
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,880
Are you okay?

500
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,000
Are you okay?

501
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,280
You just missed that truck!

502
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,240
Awesome!

503
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,320
That's awesome!

504
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,160
Oh, God, Billy!

505
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,320
Are you okay?

506
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,720
-I'm okay.
-Are you sure?

507
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,560
She just missed the truck.

508
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,080
What happened to you?

509
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,480
Nothing, we're okay. We were safe.

510
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,760
It's trashed.

511
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,360
Hang on.

512
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,160
It's over. It's over. It's all over.

513
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,760
Are you okay?

514
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,720
She's okay.

515
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,440
There is some good news.

516
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,720
It did fly.

517
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,560
What was it like?

518
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,440
It was windy.

519
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,960
Windy.

520
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,720
That's intense.

521
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,920
Move it.

522
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,920
That's intense.

523
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,880
The Auto Club's here.

524
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,800
Maybe we should stop,
see if they need help.

525
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,800
They're fine.
Pay attention to the road.

526
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,800
You're fashionably late again.

527
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,400
Give me a kiss.

528
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,880
Get out of here! Get out of here!

529
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,200
Loser!

530
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,920
Find your own twister!

531
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,040
Losers!

532
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,240
Move on!

533
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,720
Tough luck, you guys!

534
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,080
Let's go.

535
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,040
I'll get them clean.
Let's get Dorothy 2 ready.

536
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,000
You got full coverage on that truck?

537
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,760
Liability only.

538
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,360
Liability only.

539
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,880
It's a pretty truck.

540
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,640
Thank you.

541
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,640
Don't even think about it.

542
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,240
No way.

543
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:35,240
This is the caboose! This is the
caboose! I'm waiting for orders.

544
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,240
Go ahead.

545
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,080
-It's your truck.
-No, you should.

546
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,920
The battle zone should
be northeast of 81.

547
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,000
The battle zone?

548
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,440
What're we doing?

549
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,040
We're going again.

550
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,760
But back there you almost got killed!

551
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,840
Just a close call.

552
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,160
You're going to cross 15
at Oklahoma 412. 412.

553
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,800
Copy that. Haynes,
what's on the Mesonet?

554
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,120
Winds are continuing to back.

555
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,520
Okay, guys, lets go get it.

556
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,640
Mobile lab.

557
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,520
Is it me, or is the
main updraft shifting?

558
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,960
Upper-level winds are veering.

559
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,120
It might dissipate. Do we have
time to get in front of it?

560
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:08,880
Rotation is increasing. Shear is
90 knots. 50 outbound, 40 inbound.

561
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,440
We see a very pronounced hook.

562
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,440
Checking for you now.

563
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,520
We're getting southeast
gusts at 40 miles per hour.

564
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,800
Approaching 150 in the funnel.

565
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,400
Storm motion is 225 degrees
out of the southwest.

566
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,240
We're in position. Proceed.

567
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,040
Howdy!

568
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,200
Must admire their spirit.

569
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,720
There's your pal.

570
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,680
What're you doing?

571
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,520
Look at the updraft.

572
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,320
The angle.

573
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,480
It's going to shift course.

574
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,080
You sure?

575
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,840
It's definitely a sidewinder.

576
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:10,960
It'll move left.

577
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,720
-Is that bad?
-Was there a road?

578
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,320
You're right! Go!

579
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,720
Donald, now's not a good time.

580
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,040
All right, put Julia on, Donny.

581
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,600
Looking very good.

582
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:52,840
About a 4 miles up, hang a right,
let's deploy and we'll be done.

583
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,800
Shit!

584
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,200
Shit, it's moving away!

585
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,240
Looks like they'll intercept.

586
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,800
You told me this thing was going
to stay on the same heading!

587
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,440
We're close.

588
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,480
I know.

589
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,520
Where does this road take us?

590
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,080
It feels unnatural, but
with Donald's motility...

591
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:27,720
...you won't have a baby the usual
way, even standing on your head.

592
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,440
She's a reproductive therapist.

593
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,080
Laurence-- Damn.

594
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,800
We must get ahead of this storm.

595
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,560
Be right with you.

596
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,040
I can't talk now. I'll call you back.

597
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,600
South. Shifting due south, copy.

598
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:46,760
We have an F-2, ladies and
gentlemen. Possibly F-3.

599
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,720
Read me? There's very, very large
rope on the ground. Very large.

600
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:56,280
It looks like it's turning.
The atmosphere is unstable.

601
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,640
Repeat, unstable!

602
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,080
This is Rabbit!

603
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,080
It's heading this way!

604
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,920
This is Sanders.

605
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:06,680
We are driving due east on a
road we've been on for 6 miles.

606
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:10,040
We've got an F-3 sitting here
on the ground. A beauty!

607
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,000
Jo, it's Barn Burner!

608
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,680
It won't hang out long!

609
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,800
It's not hanging out.

610
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,640
We got it! We see it!

611
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,880
We're getting slammed in here.
You better hang back.

612
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,840
-Is this thing loaded?
-Yeah, go for it.

613
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,440
Rain bands.

614
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,040
Look at the surf.

615
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,960
Shit, horizontal rain! Hang on!

616
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,920
Jesus, I've never seen
clutter like this.

617
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,760
I don't think anyone has.

618
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,000
Flash frequencies are high.

619
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,680
We're in the core.

620
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,040
We got sisters!

621
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,640
Oh, my God.

622
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,800
Julia, I can't talk now.

623
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,840
-We're under the flanking line.
-I realize that.

624
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,640
We can't attack from the south.
We'll get rolled.

625
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,600
Watch me.

626
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:37,400
I know you're upset. You just must
breathe. We both got to breathe.

627
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,200
Cow.

628
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,000
I must go, Julia! We got cows!

629
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,320
Another cow!

630
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,160
I think it was the same one.

631
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,400
We got drunkards. We got no path!

632
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,600
Get us out of here!

633
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,360
-I'm trying!
-Floor it!

634
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,440
Look out!

635
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,440
Oh, God! Oh, God!

636
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,520
See that carousel? Did you see?

637
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,840
It was incredible.

638
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,440
Oh, honey--honey--

639
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,520
Did you see that?

640
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:17,480
It's all right. Come on, it's okay.

641
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,480
No, I'm not okay. This is not okay.

642
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,840
Oh, Christ, I'm sorry.

643
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,480
Honey, I didn't think.

644
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,320
When you used to tell me
that you chased tornados...

645
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,520
...deep down I always
thought it was a metaphor.

646
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,960
It's okay. It's okay.

647
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:44,320
Three times a lady!
Did you see the inflow jets?

648
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,960
See?! I was in the middle of it!

649
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,720
I'm thinking it might not
be too bad of an idea...

650
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,840
...if we left, because there
was too many tornados there.

651
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,920
Are you kidding? This thing's not over.
We've only seen the start.

652
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,120
You know...

653
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,520
...we're close to Wakita.

654
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,800
Aunt Meg wouldn't mind a pit stop.

655
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,800
We crave sustenance.

656
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,440
Guys, we are not invading my aunt.

657
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,440
Food.

658
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,880
Food.

659
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,520
We're absolutely not going.

660
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,280
There's the spot. Just do it.

661
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,400
Great.

662
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,160
Come on, honey.

663
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,440
Come on.

664
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:53,040
You must meet her, she's great.
Meg, how are you?

665
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,240
-How are you?
-It is so good to see you!

666
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,040
You too.

667
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,040
The other day I told Jo...

668
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,720
...how much I miss you.

669
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,200
You haven't seen my new work.

670
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,960
Oh, honey.

671
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,440
You've seen some action.

672
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,040
You should've seen it.

673
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,080
Boys!

674
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,840
Give me some loving!

675
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,680
In a lightning storm, grab your
ankles and stick your butt up.

676
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:26,320
It's the safest orifice to get hit.

677
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,960
I'd like to get hit, see what it's like.

678
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,280
Real lemonade. Meg, I'm moving in!

679
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,200
Look out. Make a space.

680
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,000
Look out.

681
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,920
God, you got a lot of beef.

682
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,880
-Where'd you get this beef?
-Did you see my cows?

683
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:53,760
No.

684
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,080
Cool.

685
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,440
You slaughter them.

686
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,600
Nice. Potatoes.

687
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,040
Grab it now.

688
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:07,840
Meg's gravy is famous.
It's practically a food group.

689
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,240
Shower's free.

690
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,680
I'm next.

691
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,600
I want that.

692
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,640
How can you watch this garbage?

693
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,680
Pardon me. You must see this.

694
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,080
Like for you to be out
there chasing tornados?

695
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:31,680
It's a thrill.

696
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,400
Man vs. nature. Battling the elements.

697
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,840
What a weasel.

698
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,680
As a scientist, can you
actually predict tornados now?

699
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,160
No, they're unpredictable...

700
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:45,120
...as my unfortunate
colleagues found out today.

701
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:49,120
But we hope to change all that
with a system I have devised.

702
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,880
God, he sucks.

703
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,240
Shut up!

704
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,520
Turn him off.

705
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,800
What a wiener.

706
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,480
He's so in love with himself.
I thought it was a summer thing.

707
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,480
He'll rue the day.

708
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,760
He'll rue the day he came
up against The Extreme.

709
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,520
-Hear, hear.
-Amen, baby.

710
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,000
Bill, I'm talking imminent rue-age.

711
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,160
Imminent rue-age.

712
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,160
I was just wondering, why do
you call Billy "The Extreme"?

713
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,680
'Cause Billy is The Extreme.

714
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:21,120
Bill's the most out-of-controllest
bastard in the game.

715
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,840
No, I think I came in second.

716
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,720
I've seen him in high gear.

717
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,040
You guys must get new stories.

718
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,640
I'll go clean up.

719
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,160
So...

720
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,240
...we get this one near Daleton.

721
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:35,040
God!

722
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,160
We're close and Jo's got the VID on it.

723
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,760
She's filming it.

724
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:44,640
Suddenly, this shitty-looking green
Valiant pulls up right in the way.

725
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,880
She starts yelling and this...

726
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:51,120
...loser stumbles out of the car.
He's got a bottle of Jack Daniels.

727
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,400
He's naked.

728
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,840
He's butt-naked.

729
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,280
Not naked.

730
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,320
I was not naked!

731
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,880
He's without apparel.

732
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,000
Half-naked.

733
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:06,080
Naked. So, Jo's yelling at him
to get out of the way, right?

734
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:08,960
So...

735
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:12,080
...he just strolls up to the twister...

736
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,160
...and says, "Have a drink!"

737
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,440
And he chucks the bottle
into the twister and...

738
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,680
...it never hits the ground.

739
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,400
Twister caught it, sucked it right up.

740
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,720
Honey, this is a tissue of lies.

741
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,560
There was another Bill...

742
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,000
...an evil Bill...

743
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,360
...and I killed him.

744
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,880
I love him!

745
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,160
That was a good-size twister.
What was that? An F-3?

746
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,360
F-2.

747
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:48,720
I'm lost again.

748
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,880
It's the Fujita scale. It measures a
tornado's intensity by how much it eats.

749
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:53,760
Eats?

750
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,600
Destroys.

751
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:58,960
That encounter we had was
a strong F-2, F-3, maybe.

752
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,720
We'll see F-4's today.

753
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:02,720
That'd be sweet.

754
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:06,480
Four is good. Four would
relocate your house efficiently.

755
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:08,800
Is there an F-5?

756
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,320
What would that be like?

757
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,800
The finger of God.

758
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,960
None of you has seen an F-5?

759
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,880
Just one of us.

760
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,600
Forget it.

761
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,600
Doesn't matter what you do...

762
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,520
...you'll still be beautiful.

763
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,200
You're biased.

764
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,040
Yes, I am.

765
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,240
Sounds like old times.

766
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:51,760
Yes, it does.

767
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,320
He didn't keep his part of the bargain.

768
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,160
Which part?

769
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,800
To spend his life pining for you
and die miserable and alone.

770
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,320
That so much to ask?

771
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,840
I don't know.

772
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:17,520
Bill always went his own way,
usually the same way you were going.

773
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,600
Seems like a long time ago.

774
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,480
Not so long, Jo.

775
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,720
He's here, isn't he?

776
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,320
That is so beautiful.

777
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,200
We got one!

778
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,640
F-3, mile outside of Parlaine!

779
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:47,520
This is for Garfield county,
including the city of Enid.

780
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:50,560
This storm has developed
in the last 15 minutes.

781
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:53,760
Doppler radar shows that
this is an intense storm.

782
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,800
Ride with Dusty, okay?

783
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,640
-What's SELS say?
-Big!

784
00:49:58,800 --> 00:49:59,840
Let's go!

785
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:00,880
Where's Jonas?

786
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,880
-He's in Milston.
-30 miles away.

787
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:04,720
-Can we beat him?
-I'm working on it.

788
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,240
Thanks for stopping by.

789
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,840
Sorry to eat and run.

790
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,520
It's what you live for.

791
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:11,920
Good to see you.

792
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,440
It's okay.

793
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,200
Tasty cow, Aunt Meg.

794
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:16,880
It's for you.

795
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,000
Thank you.

796
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,280
You and me, right?

797
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,080
Sweet.

798
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,120
Sweet.

799
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,200
Nice meeting you.

800
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,680
Likewise. You better run.

801
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:29,920
Keys.

802
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,000
Please. You're welcome.

803
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:34,960
Hang on.

804
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,800
We'll go through town.

805
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:43,120
We'll take Meyers Road past the fire
station, then 132 to the 44 east.

806
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,920
If there's shortcuts, let us know.

807
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,880
Rabbit, time to impress me.

808
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:25,840
A mile up there's a little detour.
We'll walk in the woods.

809
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,360
It gets bumpy here, folks.

810
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,080
Let's get you wired.

811
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,120
Excuse me.

812
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,000
Okay, you're on.

813
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,600
An ordinary person spends his life...

814
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,200
...avoiding tense situations.

815
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,520
Repo Man spends his life...

816
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:20,960
...getting into tense
situations, Beltzer!

817
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,120
What do you got?

818
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,520
Turn left here toward that farm.

819
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,440
You sure?

820
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,400
Trust me. Rabbit is good.
Rabbit is wise.

821
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:40,400
-Mother of God.
-Jesus Christ.

822
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,480
This is a field.

823
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:45,520
I know. Keep going beyond it,
through that brush.

824
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,160
See that brush right in front of you?

825
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:50,560
Yes, we see it. What's beyond that?

826
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:51,360
Beyond what?

827
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,400
Beyond what?

828
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:56,000
The brush! A brick wall,
a bearded lady, what?

829
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,560
It's the highway!

830
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:02,880
Where's the road?

831
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,320
Where's the road?

832
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,080
It should be any moment.

833
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:15,680
Hello.

834
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:16,960
Shit.

835
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:18,720
She's insane.

836
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:21,280
You're insane.
You trying to kill someone?

837
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:22,800
Really?

838
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,640
It was nice of you to see 10
people on the road and not stop!

839
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,680
Very good. Let's keep
this channel clear.

840
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,160
Dirt bag.

841
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,640
We have to get off this road.

842
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:45,880
Don't guess.

843
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,960
I'm not. Make a right turn.

844
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,280
Want to drive?

845
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:50,720
Just turn!

846
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,560
Do we follow?

847
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,600
We do not.

848
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,360
What's he doing?

849
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:12,400
I don't know.

850
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:17,440
Find this road. It's like Bob's road.

851
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:22,720
Touchdown!

852
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,440
We have touchdown.
Tornado is on the ground.

853
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:26,720
Listen to this.

854
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,560
It's coming down Route 33.

855
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,640
We're on 33.

856
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,080
What's the path?

857
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,880
It's going about 35 miles an hour.

858
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,680
-Do you see this?
-I can't.

859
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,760
Where is it? Hello.

860
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,200
Where're you looking?

861
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,040
-Where?
-Direction, Rabbit.

862
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,320
North-northeast.

863
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,200
See it?

864
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:46,360
Got anything?

865
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,280
North-northeast, do you copy?

866
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,000
It's coming right at us.

867
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,440
Axis's gone vertical.
Sucker's really gaining strength.

868
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,800
Do you see it?

869
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,200
No.

870
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:03,360
We don't have a visual! Repeat!
We don't have a visual! Help us out!

871
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:04,400
Where is it?

872
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:07,280
I got it. It's the best
motion I've ever seen.

873
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,600
The base of this fatty's over 1/2 mile.

874
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:16,560
If you're going east on 7, it's coming
over the hill in a few minutes.

875
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,480
This is the one. I feel it.

876
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,120
It must be there.

877
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,800
Maybe it stalled.

878
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,560
No, I think Rabbit's right.

879
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,560
It's going to show its ugly
face right over that hill.

880
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,280
What do you think?

881
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,440
You going for it?

882
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,440
Time for deployment.

883
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:43,440
Oh, man. This is the
fun part, sweetheart.

884
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,640
We got hail.

885
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,320
Hail. We got hail.

886
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,720
Pull over.

887
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,360
That's good.

888
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:07,840
We got a big one!

889
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,920
Upflow, Beltzer! We have upflow.
Copy.

890
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,480
I'm checking it.

891
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:18,160
I'm checking. She's almost up.

892
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:21,720
Now, this is it.

893
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,040
I'll get her ready.

894
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,360
You see them?

895
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:36,600
You see them?

896
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,840
The red truck went toward the core!

897
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,600
Is he talking about Billy?

898
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:44,760
Are you okay?!

899
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:46,360
Yes! Keep going!

900
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,560
Beltzer, we got a view!

901
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,160
I see it!

902
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:04,280
Okay, I got it!

903
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:07,280
That's no moon! It's a space station!

904
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,200
We have debris!

905
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,560
They're in the bear cage!

906
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,480
Oh, my God!

907
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:41,680
Oh, my God!

908
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:43,960
Look at this!

909
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:45,320
Take a peek!

910
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:48,520
You can really feel it
with a telephoto lens!

911
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:49,960
What's wrong?

912
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:50,840
What's wrong?

913
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,400
You people are crazy, do you know that?

914
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,920
Are you set up? We're not
Ieaving till we get this.

915
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:59,480
And she's the craziest one of them all!

916
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:13,880
Okay, she's almost ready!

917
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:15,080
Hold on!

918
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,960
We're almost there! We're almost there!

919
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,360
This is fine!

920
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:27,960
No, a little closer!

921
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:29,240
A little closer!

922
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,160
Close enough.

923
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,800
Hurry! Get the tailgate!

924
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:45,480
You got it?

925
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:47,560
She's set. Help me get her down.

926
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:49,680
Hurry!

927
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,480
Let's go!

928
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,280
Hurry!

929
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,680
Damn! We got to go!

930
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:00,760
We can do it!

931
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,840
-Come on!
-It's stuck.

932
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:22,200
Look out!

933
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,800
Come on! Hurry!

934
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,280
Where'd it go?

935
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:38,880
Where is it?

936
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:41,560
What's going on?

937
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,920
I don't believe this.

938
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:45,760
What the hell!

939
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,600
What's the Doppler say?

940
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:52,200
The cone of silence.

941
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:03,760
Bill, Jo, it's over.

942
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,360
The thing was stable and then it...

943
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:07,960
It's gone.

944
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,640
-It's backbuilding!
-It's not through yet.

945
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:14,040
You're right. It's backbuilding.

946
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:16,920
We got a jumper!

947
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,240
It's backbuilding! Track it!

948
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,720
Yeah, Jo! Data's incomplete!

949
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:23,480
You guys should get out!

950
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,760
Bill, help! Help me!

951
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:29,400
We should leave.

952
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,240
-Forget the sensors!
-Help me!

953
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,200
We must get out of here now!

954
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:35,680
Beltzer'll see if it drops!

955
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:39,160
It's not going to drop anywhere
near us! It'll drop on us!

956
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,960
We can still do this! Wait!

957
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:45,840
Go back!

958
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,080
Forget it! Forget it!

959
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:50,400
Go back! It's not too late!

960
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:58,320
-Go back!
-Forget it! It's too late!

961
01:00:58,520 --> 01:00:59,560
Help me!

962
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:01,960
Help me!

963
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:03,560
What're you doing?

964
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:05,960
The pack's wasted! It's over!

965
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:08,680
What's wrong? We can still do this!

966
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:10,680
Listen to you! You're obsessed!

967
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:12,520
You've never seen what it can do!

968
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:15,160
-I just saw it!
-You've never seen it!

969
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:20,520
You've never seen it miss this house,
miss that house and come after you.

970
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:24,360
Christ, Jo, is that
what you think it did?

971
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:27,800
You don't know.

972
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:30,200
Why can't you forget it?!

973
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:32,680
You don't understand.
You'll never know.

974
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:35,000
When's it going to be enough?

975
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:39,480
How close do you have to get?!
Talk to me! Jo, things go wrong!

976
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,480
You can't explain it!
You can't predict it!

977
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:46,160
Killing yourself won't
bring your dad back.

978
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,920
I'm sorry he died.
But it was a long time ago.

979
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,080
You've got to move on.

980
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:56,640
Stop living in the past and look
at what's right in front of you.

981
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,200
What're you saying?

982
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,000
Me, Jo.

983
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,920
You better come here and look at this.

984
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:52,240
Velocities are maxed out.
Those two cells converge....

985
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:55,200
Inbounds and outbounds have doubled.

986
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,640
There have been tornado sightings.

987
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:25,200
The latest reported just to the
northeast of Canton a few minutes ago.

988
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:29,120
Wait a second. I've just been handed
this--. This is official now.

989
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:33,520
A tornado has been reported moving
through Canton a few minutes ago.

990
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:46,000
Can I have 8 coffees to go, please?

991
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:28,240
Two coffees.

992
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:32,880
Long day.

993
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:41,120
I've been thinking about the sensors.

994
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:44,320
The way they scattered out
there today on the highway.

995
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:48,080
I'm starting to wonder...

996
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,480
...if the funnel'll carry them.

997
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:52,720
Too light?

998
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:56,080
I don't know. Maybe the
whole thing's too light.

999
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,560
What can we do?

1000
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,520
I'm not sure.

1001
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,880
This is a very dangerous situation.

1002
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:11,120
If you have loved ones in the
area do not try to help them.

1003
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,120
You'll only be a hindrance to them.

1004
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:16,960
Thank you.

1005
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:29,360
Shit. Jesus, it's coming.

1006
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:37,600
It's coming! It's headed right for us!

1007
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:40,720
It's already here.

1008
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,640
Everybody, underground!

1009
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:50,720
Honey!

1010
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,120
Come on!

1011
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:19,360
Jo, come on!

1012
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:24,400
Get underground!

1013
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:25,840
Take cover, now!

1014
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:39,680
Close the doors!

1015
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:41,360
Doors! Doors!

1016
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:51,600
Come on!

1017
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:54,960
Come back!

1018
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:56,000
Take my hand!

1019
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,000
Take my hand!

1020
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:00,800
Come on, hurry!

1021
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:05,360
Come on! Get in here! Get in here!

1022
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:09,120
Go, go, go! Come on!

1023
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:15,840
Everyone down in the pit!

1024
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:16,880
Get down!

1025
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:18,720
Everybody down!

1026
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:21,440
Move!

1027
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:49,760
Stay calm!

1028
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:09,680
I got it.

1029
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:24,560
It's okay!

1030
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:25,680
My head.

1031
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:27,040
You're okay.

1032
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:30,560
-It's not okay!
-It'll be over soon!

1033
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:32,560
This is insane!

1034
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:34,160
Stay calm!

1035
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:37,840
This is driving me crazy!
I don't want to do this!

1036
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:12,000
It's okay, honey.
It's going to be okay.

1037
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:28,320
Chewed my lips off wondering
if he was coming back home.

1038
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:30,840
I've never been so
frightened in my life.

1039
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:32,320
Was I on key?

1040
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:33,520
You were.

1041
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:35,680
Wow, that's a wonder.

1042
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:20,800
Look at the truck. It's trashed.

1043
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:35,240
Of course, tornado activity continues.

1044
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:39,160
Reports from Fairview indicate
a drive-in was blown away.

1045
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,680
We know there's injuries
and the damage is massive.

1046
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:45,240
Is that what it was like up on the hill?

1047
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:47,640
That? No.

1048
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:49,560
We were lucky.

1049
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:52,680
Those were just downdrafts
and microbursts.

1050
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:56,680
The tornado just sideswiped us.

1051
01:12:58,600 --> 01:12:59,960
Which way is it headed?

1052
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:03,400
It's banking northeast.

1053
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:10,280
It looks to hit Wakita.

1054
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:20,600
I'm going. I'm going. Let's go.

1055
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:21,480
We're going!

1056
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:23,160
Get me a route around the storm.

1057
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:25,320
Light up! Let's go!

1058
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:26,440
Wait!

1059
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:27,640
Where's the phone?

1060
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:29,480
-The lines are down.
-I'm going.

1061
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:31,720
Damn it.

1062
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:32,680
I'll drive.

1063
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:35,880
We can jump on the 38 exchange
and cross Highway 132.

1064
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:39,960
Honey, it's Meg. I got to go.

1065
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:41,400
I'm going back.

1066
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:43,880
Good. You'll be safe at the motel.

1067
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:45,640
See you in the morning.

1068
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:47,880
I won't be there.

1069
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:50,840
What?

1070
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:52,360
Why?

1071
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:54,760
What do you mean?

1072
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:56,920
I'm saying good-bye.

1073
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:01,560
You know what?
I can't compete with this.

1074
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:03,320
I don't know where to start.

1075
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:05,240
Don't do this now.

1076
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:08,760
Sooner or later it would have ended.
We both know that.

1077
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:13,240
The funny thing is...

1078
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:16,760
...I'm not that upset.

1079
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:18,920
What does that mean?

1080
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:22,280
We can do it! Come on! Let's move!

1081
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:27,640
I didn't mean it to happen.

1082
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,560
Billy, I know.

1083
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:31,160
It's okay.

1084
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:34,040
Come on.

1085
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:37,880
You go ahead.

1086
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:40,440
She needs you.

1087
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:43,480
I hope Aunt Meg's okay.

1088
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:44,600
What about you?

1089
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:47,960
Don't worry about me.

1090
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:50,120
I know my way home.

1091
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:54,840
We can be to Wakita in an hour.

1092
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:57,800
Come on.

1093
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:13,720
Oh, my God.

1094
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:24,920
They had no warning.

1095
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:58,360
Jo, wait!

1096
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:07,760
Wait!

1097
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:16,600
Careful, this house could go any second.

1098
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:25,200
Take a flashlight.

1099
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:31,640
This whole place is ready to go.

1100
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,160
Careful.

1101
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:46,960
Did you hear that?

1102
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:49,520
-I heard something.
-Easy.

1103
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:55,280
Careful.

1104
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:10,960
She's down here!

1105
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:13,560
Meg, we're here! We're coming down!

1106
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:19,920
Get this off her.

1107
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,040
Hang on.

1108
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:22,960
Don't move.

1109
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:24,560
-Ready?
-Watch your head.

1110
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:25,520
Go.

1111
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:26,640
Go.

1112
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:28,400
I got it.

1113
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,480
Easy. Are you okay?

1114
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:32,880
No, I'm all right. I'm fine.

1115
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:37,360
Oh, God.

1116
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:44,080
Hurry.

1117
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:46,000
-Let's go.
-Can you walk?

1118
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:49,680
Watch out!

1119
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:03,360
Joey, take my watch.

1120
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:04,920
Go. Careful.

1121
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:08,760
We're coming out!

1122
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:10,640
Get an ambulance!

1123
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:13,440
Get an ambulance! Move it! Now!
Go!

1124
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:14,480
Give me the lamp.

1125
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:21,800
How about steak and eggs?

1126
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:25,080
-How nice you all came over.
-There you go.

1127
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:27,560
Nice and slow.

1128
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:39,960
Easy, easy.

1129
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:45,160
Grab Mose for me! I think
he's a little shaken up.

1130
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:47,560
Don't worry, I'll get him!

1131
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:52,920
Is she okay?

1132
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:55,240
We'll probably keep her overnight.

1133
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:56,520
Forget it.

1134
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:58,920
-I'm all right.
-You're going to the hospital.

1135
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:01,880
Okay, I'll go. But I'm
going to drive myself.

1136
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:04,120
Your car's in a tree around the corner.

1137
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:08,760
It's okay.

1138
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:10,200
It's okay.

1139
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:25,160
The F-4 that hit Wakita has
now moved to the Northeast.

1140
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:29,640
I've just gotten word in that an even
stronger tornado has started to form...

1141
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:34,280
...25 miles south where the two
storms met and combined forces.

1142
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:36,920
Weather Service says this is unusual.

1143
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:39,480
Oh, my God.

1144
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:43,480
Look at this. Here, look at this.

1145
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:47,800
We're talking about winds in
excess of 300 miles an hour.

1146
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:48,920
What're you doing?

1147
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:51,480
I want to see how you are. How is she?

1148
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:53,720
I was worried about you.

1149
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:58,680
-Look at this.
-It's nothing.

1150
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:04,120
He says I have a bump on the
head and maybe a broken wrist.

1151
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:06,520
Let me see that.

1152
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:09,400
There's nothing to see.
It doesn't hurt.

1153
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:12,760
I'm sorry I wasn't there.

1154
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:18,120
Stop blaming yourself.
You got me out of the house.

1155
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:20,840
It's got to stop.

1156
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,680
I didn't have any warning.

1157
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:27,400
The sirens went off a few seconds before
it hit. I didn't get downstairs.

1158
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:31,560
I'm sorry.

1159
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:35,560
I was listening to the
radio and...I mean...

1160
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:38,120
You may not want to know,
but it's happening.

1161
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:40,680
N.S.S.L's predicting an F-5.

1162
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:46,680
It's going to happen to someone else.

1163
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:49,480
You go stop it.

1164
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:52,280
I don't know how.

1165
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:55,320
I think you do.

1166
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:59,640
You've been chasing these things
since you were a little kid.

1167
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:02,120
It's what you do.

1168
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:03,800
Go. Do it.

1169
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:26,160
You all right?

1170
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:29,920
I thought you were going with Meg.

1171
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,120
What is it?

1172
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:41,360
What is it?

1173
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:45,280
I know how to make Dorothy fly.

1174
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:01,040
Of course.

1175
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:03,120
Of course.

1176
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:06,080
I need every aluminum can you can find.

1177
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:07,920
We need cutters and duct tape.

1178
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:12,800
I want to get the last Dorothy on the
back of my truck. Both of them, now.

1179
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:15,760
We're gone!

1180
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:19,200
Are you ready?

1181
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:21,440
We're good.

1182
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:24,960
We're good? Good.

1183
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:26,160
We're very good.

1184
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:35,280
Let's go! Come on!

1185
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:37,360
-You get them done?
-I think so.

1186
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:39,120
Beautiful.

1187
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:53,440
Good?

1188
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:55,920
Great job. Be ready to record.

1189
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:56,960
Ready?

1190
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:57,920
Be careful.

1191
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:00,000
Don't follow too close.

1192
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:01,680
You got it, boss!

1193
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:08,720
We're back in business.

1194
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:14,400
Come on, let's go.

1195
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:18,840
Half a mile more?

1196
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:21,120
Sounds right.

1197
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:24,040
I'll put her in the road.

1198
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:26,280
Won't someone hit it?

1199
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:28,920
Nobody'll be there.

1200
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:41,360
Hurry!

1201
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:43,040
Let's go.

1202
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:52,800
Okay, that's good!

1203
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,760
-Got it?
-Let's go!

1204
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:01,760
You in position?

1205
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:04,120
Ready for contact!

1206
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:13,480
This is it.

1207
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:14,760
It'll work.

1208
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:18,280
Just another minute.

1209
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:19,960
We're ready!

1210
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:38,120
Come on, come on, take her!

1211
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:38,920
Too light.

1212
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:39,880
No, it's not.

1213
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,040
-We're losing it.
-No, she can still fly.

1214
01:25:58,560 --> 01:25:59,520
Get in!

1215
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:12,320
Oh, my God!

1216
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:15,840
Get us off this thing!

1217
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,120
Hurry!

1218
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:30,120
What is that?

1219
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:38,760
What is that?

1220
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,120
Hurry!

1221
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:42,880
Hurry!

1222
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:46,240
This is not good!

1223
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:55,360
Hurry!

1224
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:10,720
Go!

1225
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,280
Son-of-a-bitch!

1226
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:37,120
Jo, Bill, you all right?

1227
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:38,960
Can you guys hear me?

1228
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:40,400
We're okay.

1229
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:43,120
Jo, Bill, did you see that explosion?

1230
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:46,320
We saw it.

1231
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:52,240
This monster's moving northeast on 80!

1232
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:53,360
Copy?!

1233
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:54,800
This is it.

1234
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:56,480
Last one.

1235
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,880
Last time.

1236
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:02,880
Mobile lab to Mobile One.
Ground speed is increasing.

1237
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:05,520
The base is a mile wide.
We can't see it anymore.

1238
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:07,120
What's your location?

1239
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:10,240
I am right alongside her!
She's beautiful!

1240
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:14,160
We're ready to play, so pull
back and prepare to monitor.

1241
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:20,960
They had to be somewhere.

1242
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:23,440
Path is stable, copy that.

1243
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:24,720
Men...

1244
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:26,960
...this is it.

1245
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:28,800
Stay sharp back there.

1246
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:30,560
They have position.

1247
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:34,080
They could make it.

1248
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:38,160
Not unless they anchor the pack.

1249
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:44,400
Jonas, can you hear me?

1250
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:46,160
Not now.

1251
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:48,880
Jonas, listen to me.
The pack is too light.

1252
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:51,120
The twister'll toss it. Anchor it.

1253
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:54,400
Sharing valuable information, Jo.

1254
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:56,080
I'll consider that. Thanks.

1255
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:57,520
Listen to me!

1256
01:28:57,760 --> 01:28:58,880
What?

1257
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:00,960
Can you see them?

1258
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:02,560
Jonas, what's your position?

1259
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:03,600
Howdy, Bill.

1260
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:06,400
We're heading northeast, parallel...

1261
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:09,040
...about to pull off
ahead of it on the left.

1262
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:11,920
Hang back a minute. We got
a good view from back here.

1263
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:16,240
She could shift or track and if
she does, she'll come right at you.

1264
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:18,800
Let's do that. He'd never
put us in harm's way.

1265
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:21,160
When I want your opinion, I'll give it.

1266
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:24,000
Shut up, put your foot on
the gas, and stay on course.

1267
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:25,080
It's unbelievable!

1268
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:26,120
What's wrong?

1269
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:29,640
The base is so huge!
It must be at least a mile wide!

1270
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:30,840
Do you copy?

1271
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:32,400
Listen to me!

1272
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:34,120
Get off this frequency!

1273
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:35,320
She's shifting.

1274
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:38,280
Oh, my God.

1275
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:42,040
Jonas, I'm telling you!

1276
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:44,200
Eddie, I know you can hear me!

1277
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:45,320
Get out!

1278
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:54,440
Look out!

1279
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:23,560
Damn!

1280
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:24,840
Stupid!

1281
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:28,280
We tried.

1282
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:30,360
We can do nothing.

1283
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:36,960
-Yes, we can.
-Ground speed is increasing.

1284
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:40,840
Get ahead of it quickly,
or she'll bury you.

1285
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:04,520
We have debris!

1286
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:06,080
Right!

1287
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:11,000
Right!

1288
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:14,360
Left!

1289
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:20,440
-What now?
-I have no idea.

1290
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:23,080
You still with us?

1291
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:26,240
Oh, my God.

1292
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:28,440
I think we're going in.

1293
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:48,320
Maybe we should get off this road.

1294
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:50,000
You may be right.

1295
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:51,200
Are you okay?

1296
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:54,000
You set up?

1297
01:31:54,160 --> 01:31:56,720
-We're set. You going in?
-We are.

1298
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:58,720
-You ready?
-I'm on it.

1299
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:00,000
Be careful.

1300
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:14,720
She's up.

1301
01:32:21,640 --> 01:32:23,080
Where are they?

1302
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:26,040
Doppler tracking is great!
Wind speed increasing!

1303
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:29,800
I've never seen anything like this.

1304
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:34,640
They're going to punch the core.

1305
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:48,240
Ready?

1306
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:51,360
Let me set the cruise control.

1307
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:53,440
We're good.

1308
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:55,520
On three?

1309
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:57,680
On three.

1310
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:02,560
Go!

1311
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,040
Ready?

1312
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:14,160
Ready.

1313
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:14,960
One!

1314
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:16,400
Two!

1315
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:17,200
Three!

1316
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:31,520
Go...

1317
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:32,640
...go...

1318
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,480
...go! Go!

1319
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:58,600
Dorothy's flying!

1320
01:33:58,760 --> 01:34:00,200
She's flying!

1321
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:01,480
Look!

1322
01:34:01,640 --> 01:34:02,840
We're in!

1323
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,080
I don't believe it! We're in!

1324
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:06,920
We'll be very popular!

1325
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:08,760
-She's flying!
-Look at that!

1326
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:12,120
It's beautiful. It's working.
It's Christmas time.

1327
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:14,440
We're inside! It's working!

1328
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:16,680
-Dorothy did it!
-I'm getting readings!

1329
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:19,400
This is it! We did it, man!

1330
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:21,320
We just made history.

1331
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:26,120
You guys, it's about to shift northeast.

1332
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:32,280
You should get out of there!
Do you copy?

1333
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:34,600
Do you copy?

1334
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:41,160
Run!

1335
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:16,680
The barn! Come on!

1336
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:20,280
Look out!

1337
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:28,800
Here!

1338
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:30,560
Go! Hurry!

1339
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:36,320
To the barn!

1340
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:49,080
Stay down!

1341
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:58,920
My God! Who are these people?

1342
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:01,000
I don't think so.

1343
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:05,320
Quick!

1344
01:36:17,720 --> 01:36:18,760
Oh, my God!

1345
01:36:21,160 --> 01:36:22,040
Come on!

1346
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:29,080
Run for it!

1347
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:51,320
Get down!

1348
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:56,040
Come on!

1349
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:25,320
Here!

1350
01:37:25,480 --> 01:37:29,600
These pipes go down at least 30 feet.
We anchor to it, we may have a chance!

1351
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:34,880
No good!

1352
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:36,120
This!

1353
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:41,000
Get in!

1354
01:37:53,640 --> 01:37:54,600
Hold on!

1355
01:38:18,680 --> 01:38:20,120
Hang on!

1356
01:39:55,680 --> 01:39:57,600
-You all right?
-Are you?

1357
01:40:08,280 --> 01:40:09,760
Look at that.

1358
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:12,600
It didn't take the house.

1359
01:40:20,920 --> 01:40:22,200
We did it.

1360
01:40:22,360 --> 01:40:23,640
Yeah, we did.

1361
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:25,280
Dorothy really flew.

1362
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:27,640
It was a good idea.

1363
01:40:31,160 --> 01:40:33,280
We've got so much to do.

1364
01:40:34,680 --> 01:40:37,080
I'll get grant approval
for a warning system.

1365
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:39,960
We need a bigger lab.
You must start analyzing data.

1366
01:40:40,120 --> 01:40:40,760
I do?

1367
01:40:41,240 --> 01:40:44,600
We must generate models of the
data, and I must run the lab.

1368
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:47,640
You do the analysis, I'll run the lab.

1369
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:50,560
You're running the lab?
I don't think so.

1370
01:40:55,200 --> 01:40:57,880
Do you always have to
do things the hard way?

1371
01:40:59,480 --> 01:41:04,160
We got it, guys! The sensors worked!
The computers went crazy! We got data!

1372
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:06,880
It's the biggest twister on record!

1373
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:09,400
Check out that sky.

1374
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,400
You know what?
I think we've seen enough.

1375
01:41:13,401 --> 01:41:14,401
