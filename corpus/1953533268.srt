could benefit.

one of your pet subjects.

60

83
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:35,753
Possibly, because he's bought
himself a seat

on the university's advisory board.

in private so...

is assemble a team.

00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,958
that she could be part of the team
as soon as we got funded.

I'm assuming the worst.

109
00:08:49,094 --> 00:08:51,462
We have to get in there before
somebody stumbles upon them

110
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,063
and the information they've been
able to gather.

111
00:08:53,832 --> 00:08:55,199

As far as anyone
else is concerned,

115

Okay, let's get to work.

133
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:02,833
Now.

134
00:10:02,901 --> 00:10:05,036
This is going to be
a historical journey.

135
00:10:05,103 --> 00:10:06,470
If we're successful,

136
00:10:06,538 --> 00:10:07,905
the entire scientific community

137
00:10:07,973 --> 00:10:10,107
is going to know
what we've accomplished.

138
00:10:10,175 --> 00:10:12,176
Now, first a little background.

139
00:10:12,243 --> 00:10:14,511
The Calusa Indians were first
presumed extinct,

140
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,082
when the 1850 census
didn't register any tribe members.

141
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:21,251
But discoveries since then
proved that the tribe
could still exist.

142
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:24,522
But, do you really think
that they could exist
for a 150 years

143
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:27,658
without anyone actually
seeing them?

144
00:10:27,726 --> 00:10:30,528
I think they just moved deeper
into their own backyard.

145
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:32,764
The Everglades are still
a pretty wild place

146
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,566
and the Calusa like most
true Native Americans

147
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:39,070
were known to use
extreme measures to
protect their way of life.

148
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:42,239
Now, take a look at these.

149
00:10:42,307 --> 00:10:44,975
These are excerpts
from the 400 year old journals

150
00:10:45,043 --> 00:10:46,944
of D'Escalante Fontaneda.

151
00:10:47,912 --> 00:10:49,180
A shipwrecked Spaniard

152
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:51,916
who lived with the Calusa Indians
for 17 years.

153
00:10:51,983 --> 00:10:54,384
Now by analyzing these, Cushing was
able to determine

154
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:58,856
the whereabouts of the last known
Calusive settlement.

155
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:02,126
In fact, the evidence points
to the possibility

156
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:04,395
that they still may exist today.

157
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:06,196
And if they do...

158
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:10,401
I want us to be the first ones
to find them.

159
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:12,169
Now, Todd,

160
00:11:12,237 --> 00:11:15,272
it's gonna be your job
to arrange for the airboat

161
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,942
and take us to this point here.

162
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:19,343
Now, I know you can't
see it on the map

163
00:11:19,411 --> 00:11:21,412
but this is actually
a remote island

164
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,481
accessible only by airboats.

165
00:11:23,548 --> 00:11:25,850
Now let's go over exactly
what we need to bring.

166
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:42,833
That's the last of the gear
and provisions.

167
00:11:42,901 --> 00:11:45,570
Oh, we're already set to go.

168
00:11:45,637 --> 00:11:48,239
Are you sure there's nothing
left in your car?

169
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:50,141
I'll go double check.

170
00:11:52,844 --> 00:11:54,278
Todd!

171
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,249
On this trip let's
concentrate on work.

172
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:01,018
I wanna come off
as professional, okay?

173
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,988
All right?
All right.

174
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,490
Let's just keep it
discrete, okay?

175
00:12:08,626 --> 00:12:09,994
Hey, everyone,
am I late?

176
00:12:10,695 --> 00:12:12,697
Nope, right on time.

177
00:12:24,676 --> 00:12:26,711
Hey, you need
some help with that?

178
00:12:26,778 --> 00:12:28,178
Hey, I think we better
check the car

179
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,281
one more time just in case.

180
00:12:33,985 --> 00:12:35,552
Why are you paying
attention to her?

181
00:12:36,488 --> 00:12:38,222
Well, we're all set.

182
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,558
Except for that photographer.

183
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,726
I hope he's not a no-show.

184
00:12:42,794 --> 00:12:44,128
Could this be him?

(CAR APPROACHING)

186
00:13:06,251 --> 00:13:08,018
Mr. Friels, come to see us off?

187
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:10,654
No, not exactly.

188
00:13:10,722 --> 00:13:12,723
I've come to join your expedition.

189
00:13:12,757 --> 00:13:13,890
Look, I appreciate the gesture,

190
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,826
but you've already
done so much for us.

191
00:13:15,893 --> 00:13:17,195
Now, Dr. Thomas,

192
00:13:17,262 --> 00:13:20,197
I've been on safari
in Africa, Alaska, India.

193
00:13:20,265 --> 00:13:22,266
The Everglades is still
a pretty wild place.

194
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:25,335
And I'm not at all worried
about a little swamp.

195
00:13:25,403 --> 00:13:27,438
All that I'm saying is that
once we get started...

196
00:13:27,472 --> 00:13:28,806
Dr. Thomas.

197
00:13:31,042 --> 00:13:33,577
This is as much my expedition
as it is yours.

00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:40,417
Hello, Mr. Friels.

201
00:13:40,485 --> 00:13:41,686
It's very nice to meet you.

202
00:13:41,753 --> 00:13:43,520
Thank you for your grant.

203

Please, call me Wilson.

These are two members
of my team here.

Hey, you're the angel

208
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:55,198

209
00:13:55,266 --> 00:13:56,600
Something like that.

00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:11,648
All right.

00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,676
We thought you were a no-show.

221
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:41,211
Me? Never.
I love my job.

222
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,047
They said you were professional.

223
00:14:43,982 --> 00:14:45,216
All right,
all right, let's go.

226
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:37,361
It's about 20 miles to the
last known Calusa settlement.

227
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:41,465
We'll find a clearing
away from the water
and make our camp there.

228
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:56,313
Looks like there's
a clearing up ahead.

229
00:16:56,381 --> 00:16:58,715
We'll set up camp for the night.

230
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,529
Looks like we might get some rain
so let's pick it up.

Where do you want
our tent set up?

232
00:17:20,505 --> 00:17:22,606
Over there.

233
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:26,143
All right, Lori, Nichelle,
as soon as you have
your tents set up,

234
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,111
let's get some food started.

235
00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:30,647
Nothing like roughing it.

236
00:17:30,715 --> 00:17:34,285
Kid, I hope you brought
industrial-strength
bug spray?

237
00:17:34,352 --> 00:17:36,020
I just saw a mosquito
with a bottle of liquor

238
00:17:36,087 --> 00:17:38,022
and a tattoo that says,
"Life sucks."

Can I have some help
over here, please?

245
00:17:56,207 --> 00:17:59,576
What made you decide to come
at the last minute?

246
00:17:59,644 --> 00:18:01,444
Well, I've

247
00:18:01,512 --> 00:18:04,614
always been fascinated
by South Florida.

248
00:18:04,682 --> 00:18:08,252
Its history,
mystique, legends.

249
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:10,420
Which ones?

250
00:18:10,488 --> 00:18:13,056
Calusa legends,
of course.

251
00:18:13,124 --> 00:18:14,324
Such as?

252
00:18:17,161 --> 00:18:19,964
Marta, you may think
that I'm just some

253
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,666
rich businessman out
for a little adventure,

254
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:24,435
but the fact is...

255
00:18:24,502 --> 00:18:27,604
I myself am an amateur
cryptozoologist.

256
00:18:27,672 --> 00:18:29,305
Really?
Really.

257
00:18:31,308 --> 00:18:34,111
I've searched
for Bigfoot, Noah's Ark.

258
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:38,215
I've even funded a little research
on the Loch Ness monster.

259
00:18:38,282 --> 00:18:41,151
Wow! Do you think that stuff
really exists?

260
00:18:41,219 --> 00:18:42,652
FRIELS: Who knows?

261
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,923
But it certainly is fun
trying to find out.

262
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:47,724
So what's the Everglades angle?

263
00:18:48,793 --> 00:18:51,962
In the journals
of D'Escalante Fontaneda,

264
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,633
he writes about the great 
healing abilities of the Calusa.

265
00:18:57,235 --> 00:18:58,902
Legend has it,

266
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:02,739
that every 15 years the Calusa
would send one warrior

267
00:19:02,807 --> 00:19:04,841
into their sacred place

268
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:08,646
and there he would learn the
secrets of both life and death.

269
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,782
Supposedly,

270
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:13,083
most never returned.

271
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,887
According to the legend,

272
00:19:17,955 --> 00:19:21,859
it's even supposed to be 
guarded by some evil creature.

273
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,062
Where did you
get that information?

274
00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:27,197
From a translation
of the actual journals.

275
00:19:27,265 --> 00:19:30,167
The ones on loan to
the Museum of Natural
History in Washington?

276
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:31,534
They would only
send me excerpts.

277
00:19:32,503 --> 00:19:34,771
They told me the same thing.

278
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:40,244
But a sizeable donation seemed
to change their mind.

279
00:19:41,412 --> 00:19:44,514
They sent me a microfilm copy
of the journals,

280
00:19:44,582 --> 00:19:47,050
drawings, charts and rubbings.

281
00:19:47,118 --> 00:19:48,252
Do you realize
with that information

282
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:50,720
I could have gotten our
grant approved.

283
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:53,924
Well, you are here.

284
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:55,793
So in a way, it did.

285
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:00,864
So, Derek, you haven't
said much?

286
00:20:00,932 --> 00:20:02,166
Yeah, Derek,
what's your story?

287
00:20:04,669 --> 00:20:08,405
Let's just say I look after
Mr. Friels' best interest.

288
00:20:11,943 --> 00:20:14,545
I think that, uh,
I'll turn in.

289
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,246
I think we should
all turn in.

290
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:19,016

of us tomorrow.

00:20:38,469 --> 00:20:40,637
Definitely a big cat,
probably a panther.

But the other...

I'm not sure.

00:20:43,908 --> 00:20:45,241
Maybe a bear.

attacking a bear.

00:20:47,912 --> 00:20:49,346
Me neither.

it is will come back?

No, it's...

303
00:20:54,285 --> 00:20:56,120
It's completed the hunt.

304
00:20:56,187 --> 00:20:59,356

secluded place to feed.

in there?

the settlement.

as a marker,

where it is.

00:27:05,823 --> 00:27:08,024
there's no way we can make it
across on foot.

360
00:27:08,092 --> 00:27:09,292
I'll call for help.

361
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,493
I've tried to call out
several times,

362
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,895
you won't get
a signal out here.

363
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,329
You're right, it's dead.

364
00:27:13,397 --> 00:27:14,964
All right, all right, look, 
just everyone stay calm.

365
00:27:15,032 --> 00:27:16,299
(WHIMPERS) You mean
we can't leave?

366
00:27:16,367 --> 00:27:17,934
(CAMERA CLICKS)

367
00:27:18,002 --> 00:27:19,670
The airboat is not gonna
be back to pick us up
for several days,

368
00:27:19,737 --> 00:27:21,737
until then, we'll just have 
to deal with this on our own.

369
00:27:21,805 --> 00:27:25,308
FRIELS: Whatever animal caused 
this is probably long gone.

370
00:27:25,376 --> 00:27:27,243
We should make this
our base camp.

371
00:27:27,311 --> 00:27:28,812
Are you nuts?

372
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,148
He's right. We can't leave.

373
00:27:31,215 --> 00:27:33,316
So let's just focus on 
what we came here to do.

374
00:27:33,383 --> 00:27:35,418
Besides, if there's
any members of
the Warren team

375
00:27:35,486 --> 00:27:37,187
they're gonna try to 
make it back to this camp.

376
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:39,022
I think it'd be safer if
we cross the river.

377
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,124
Yeah, I don't wanna stay here.

378
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:44,594
If there's a bear or panther 
out there hunting humans,

379
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:46,196
Derek and I are your
best protection.

380
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:48,198
And you know what?
We're staying here.

381
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:50,600
THOMAS:
Besides, it's much more
dangerous by the river.

382
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:51,768
Look.

383
00:27:51,835 --> 00:27:53,937
Everyone just be careful.

384
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,438
All right, Todd,

385
00:27:55,506 --> 00:27:57,773
help clear some of the 
underbrush around the perimeter.

386
00:27:57,841 --> 00:27:59,776
Lori, Nichelle,
come with me.

387
00:28:04,415 --> 00:28:06,582
Derek,
could you, uh,

388
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:08,618
do something with it?

389
00:28:08,685 --> 00:28:10,519
I'll take care of it.

390
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,696
Todd, Allison, before you do
anything else,

391
00:28:19,763 --> 00:28:21,298
these seem to be
perimeter lights.

392
00:28:21,365 --> 00:28:23,833
See if you can find
a power source.

393
00:28:23,901 --> 00:28:26,136
Lori, Nichelle,

394
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:29,872
let's clean up
some of this mess.

395
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,842
Kleeger, we could really
use some of your help.

396
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:35,345
Yeah, I'm gonna help myself
to this tent first.

397
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:37,380
Oh, check it out,
we got a generator.

398
00:28:37,448 --> 00:28:38,681
(SIGHS)

399
00:28:44,021 --> 00:28:45,388
Think you can
get it to work?

400
00:28:45,456 --> 00:28:46,856
Doesn't look damaged.

401
00:28:46,924 --> 00:28:49,258
It's even got some fuel in it.

402
00:29:25,129 --> 00:29:28,264
Hey, Doc,
I think you better
take a look at this.

403
00:29:50,187 --> 00:29:52,188
THOMAS: All right, gang,
time to get down
to business.

404
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,623
We'll split into two teams,

405
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:55,224
each with its own objective.

406
00:29:55,292 --> 00:29:56,793
My team is gonna 
consist of Todd,

407
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:58,595
Lori, Allison and Nichelle.

408
00:29:58,662 --> 00:30:00,964
We're gonna be
working on Allison's
find in the tent.

409
00:30:01,031 --> 00:30:03,800
Marta, Derek, Wilson, I want
you to explore the 
surrounding areas

410
00:30:03,867 --> 00:30:06,403
and search for any signs
of Warren's team.

411
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:07,704
We will make
circular patterns

412
00:30:07,771 --> 00:30:09,339
around the camp
about 10 feet apart.

413
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:10,773
Use yellow tape,

414
00:30:10,841 --> 00:30:13,042
for any other excavations
or artifacts you might find

415
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:15,845
and red for anything else.

416
00:30:15,912 --> 00:30:18,615
Kleeger, I'll need for you to get
some pictures of this before 
we get started.

417
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:20,116
You got it.
THOMAS: All right.

418
00:30:20,818 --> 00:30:22,718
Any questions?

419
00:30:22,786 --> 00:30:24,354
Let's go to work.

420
00:30:41,972 --> 00:30:43,506
(CAMERA CLICKING)

421
00:30:45,342 --> 00:30:47,043
THOMAS: Todd, Lori,

422
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:49,479
I need for you to go and get
the backpack we passed earlier

423
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:51,648
and search for anything else
that was left in the area.

424
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,786
(CLICKING CONTINUES)

425
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:59,022
All right.
That's all I need, Doc.

426
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,223
I'm gonna catch up
with the others.

427
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:01,391
Okay.

428
00:31:22,446 --> 00:31:24,380
Hey, I found something!

429
00:31:30,821 --> 00:31:33,556
We can use this for cleaning
and cooking.

430
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,561
No, this isn't it.

431
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,446
Hey, Doc, take a look
at this.

432
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:49,065
According to Calusa folklore,

433
00:32:49,132 --> 00:32:52,235
only the warrior who is proven
pure of spirit

434
00:32:52,302 --> 00:32:54,671
was able to take
the urn of the elders

435
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:56,840
and to battle with them.

436
00:32:56,907 --> 00:32:59,175
They believed it would ward off 
evil spirits.

437
00:33:44,054 --> 00:33:45,855
(GASPS)

438
00:33:45,922 --> 00:33:49,659
Oh, I think you should 
give me some kind of warning 
next time.

439
00:33:52,495 --> 00:33:54,130
MARTA: What is it?

440
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,497
Well...

441
00:33:55,565 --> 00:33:57,233
Nice find, Marta.

442
00:33:59,236 --> 00:34:00,904
You found the gates of hell.

443
00:34:00,971 --> 00:34:02,705
What are you talking about?

444
00:34:02,772 --> 00:34:04,874
The Calusa's sacred place.

445
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:08,511
Should be right through there.

446
00:34:08,578 --> 00:34:10,313
This is it.

447
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,916
Somewhere in there

448
00:34:12,983 --> 00:34:15,351
is the secret to life and death.

449
00:34:17,254 --> 00:34:19,421
Let's keep this in perspective.

450
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:21,257
Have either of you found
anything else?

451
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:24,560
What else is there to find?

452
00:34:24,628 --> 00:34:26,529
If the Calusa do still exist,

453
00:34:27,564 --> 00:34:30,600
they'll show up here
sooner or later.

454
00:34:30,367 --> 00:34:31,667
Let's get back to camp.

455
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:35,271
Brin's gonna love your theory.

456
00:34:44,948 --> 00:34:46,349
THOMAS: So,

457
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,950
all in all,

458
00:34:48,018 --> 00:34:50,486
I'd say we had
a pretty successful day.

459
00:34:50,554 --> 00:34:53,789
We were able to uncover 
the remains of a Calusa warrior,

460
00:34:53,857 --> 00:34:56,626
as well as those
of a Spanish conquistador.

461
00:34:56,693 --> 00:34:58,627
Judging by the depth
that we found them,

462
00:34:58,695 --> 00:35:03,800
I would put their age
at about 350 to 400 years.

463
00:35:03,867 --> 00:35:06,035
So that would mean the 1850 census
was correct.

464
00:35:06,102 --> 00:35:08,404
It's a little too early
to tell that.

465
00:35:08,471 --> 00:35:11,207
But I feel this is only the 
beginning of what we're 
gonna find here.

466
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:13,275
FRIELS: Well,

467
00:35:13,343 --> 00:35:14,978
that's all very exciting.

468
00:35:15,045 --> 00:35:20,215
But I do believe that we get the
gold star for the day.

469
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:23,519
We searched a radius of about 
50 yards around the camp,

470
00:35:23,587 --> 00:35:26,822
locating a spring about
30 yards to the south.

471
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:29,792
We can replenish
our water supply there.

472
00:35:29,859 --> 00:35:34,196
I also found some human tracks
around the spring.

473
00:35:34,264 --> 00:35:35,665
I want pictures of it all.

474
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,267
Any signs of Warren's team?

475
00:35:38,735 --> 00:35:41,103
No, nothing.

476
00:35:41,171 --> 00:35:43,806
We did find something
rather amazing.

477
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,644
To the east,

478
00:35:48,712 --> 00:35:51,847
we came across two cypress trees

479
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:54,050
that had some sort of

480
00:35:54,651 --> 00:35:57,020
tribal significance.

481
00:35:56,887 --> 00:36:00,690
They mark the entrance
to the Calusa's sacred area.

482
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:03,693
A place that holds the secrets
to both life and death

483
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:08,798
and, of course, there is the 
mythical creature that
supposedly guards it.

484
00:36:08,865 --> 00:36:11,534
The creature attacked
a Calusa village.

485
00:36:11,601 --> 00:36:13,202
They set a trap,

486
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:15,338
caught it and cut off
its head.

487
00:36:16,173 --> 00:36:18,107
Split it in two,

488
00:36:18,175 --> 00:36:21,510
and set each half
on two cypress trees.

489
00:36:21,578 --> 00:36:22,778
FRIELS: And,

490
00:36:24,114 --> 00:36:25,982
according to legend,

491
00:36:26,049 --> 00:36:29,318
the blood of the creature
flowing down the sides
of the trees,

492
00:36:29,386 --> 00:36:32,688
carved the faces of the 
warriors into the bark,

493
00:36:32,756 --> 00:36:36,125
imprisoning their
spirits forever.

494
00:36:36,192 --> 00:36:38,094
I'll get some shots
in the morning.

495
00:36:38,161 --> 00:36:40,896
Well, I finally pieced the last
fragments of pottery together.

496
00:36:42,298 --> 00:36:44,633
It's a picture of the Calusa
holding spears,

497
00:36:44,701 --> 00:36:47,870
fighting with some
type of creature.

498
00:36:47,938 --> 00:36:50,272
And just who's hunting who?

499
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:53,442
THOMAS:
It was not unusual
for ancient cultures

500
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:56,312
to depict their prey
as mythical creatures.

501
00:36:57,747 --> 00:36:59,481
All right, everyone,

502
00:36:59,549 --> 00:37:01,284
we've got a long day tomorrow.

503
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:03,485
So I suggest we get ourselves
squared away,

504
00:37:03,553 --> 00:37:05,721
while we still have the light.

505
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,447
Psst.

506
00:37:31,514 --> 00:37:33,449
Hey!
Hey.

507
00:37:33,516 --> 00:37:34,850
I really feel like shit,
I need to find a place
to rinse off.

508
00:37:34,918 --> 00:37:36,385
Would you come with me?

509
00:37:36,453 --> 00:37:37,686
I don't wanna go alone.

510
00:37:37,754 --> 00:37:39,355
(SIGHS) Yeah, sure.

511
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:42,958
See if I can find that spring
Doc Thomas mentioned.

512
00:38:05,682 --> 00:38:07,883
You know, you can join me
if you want.

513
00:38:07,951 --> 00:38:09,051
It's all right.

515
00:38:47,324 --> 00:38:48,457
Nice.

00:38:55,899 --> 00:38:57,633
Nichelle.
Nichelle.

517
00:38:57,701 --> 00:38:58,901
All right, I am sorry.

00:39:06,843 --> 00:39:08,944
THOMAS: Derek.

521
00:39:09,012 --> 00:39:10,245
What the hell was that?

522
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,414
I don't know, let's find out.

523
00:39:11,481 --> 00:39:13,616
Marta, you stay here
with Allison.

524
00:39:17,754 --> 00:39:18,854
Lori!

525
00:39:28,798 --> 00:39:30,366
What happened?
Over there!

526
00:39:31,735 --> 00:39:33,436
Get back to camp.

527
00:39:39,075 --> 00:39:40,810
Where's Lori?
I don't know.

528
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,578
I left her for 30 seconds.

529
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:43,746
Derek,

530
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:44,947
check in that direction.

531
00:39:45,048 --> 00:39:46,181
I'll circle back up here.

532
00:39:46,249 --> 00:39:48,484
What happened?
I don't know!

I bet it was a gator.

538
00:41:01,758 --> 00:41:03,492
What was she doing
out there alone?

539
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,295
Look, I was with her.
I thought she was done
cleaning up, so I came back.

540
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:09,164
We said that nobody is supposed
to be out there by themselves.

541
00:41:09,232 --> 00:41:11,567
That's right.
The buddy system, remember?

00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,335
Shut up, Kleeger!

543
00:41:13,403 --> 00:41:15,036
We can still go look for her.
We can go right now
and look for her.

Listen to me, listen to me!
Come here.

545

Nobody is leaving this camp.

Not now.

We found it in Maggie Warren's

567
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,094
I financed her expedition.

568
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:48,564
And they never returned.

569
00:42:53,436 --> 00:42:55,571
Why didn't you tell us?

570
00:42:55,638 --> 00:42:59,274
Frankly, it's none
of your business.

571
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:02,811
You knew that
something went wrong,

572
00:43:02,879 --> 00:43:05,914
and you let us walk right into
the same situation.

573
00:43:05,982 --> 00:43:08,550
I had no idea that
anything had gone wrong.

574
00:43:08,618 --> 00:43:10,352
You still know more
than you're telling us.

579
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:38,246
Where did you get this?

580
00:43:38,314 --> 00:43:41,216
A 20-year-old magazine article.

581
00:43:41,284 --> 00:43:43,986
That's also depicted in
Fontenada's journals.

582
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:45,921
It's the same as the creature
on the pottery.

583
00:43:48,324 --> 00:43:52,161
My guess is, it's some form of
a mutated gator.

584
00:43:52,228 --> 00:43:54,830
And if the Calusa
still do exist,

585
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:58,500
I'm betting that that creature
still exists.

586
00:43:58,568 --> 00:44:03,238
If you thought this was here,
why didn't you warn us?

587
00:44:03,306 --> 00:44:05,640
Warn you about what, Marta?

588
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:08,143
A myth?

589
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:12,147
Do you really think that your
husband would've forgone his
adventure because of a myth?

590
00:44:12,215 --> 00:44:16,585
Really, both of you would
still be here.

591
00:44:16,653 --> 00:44:19,755
So, don't pollute this
conversation with your remorse.

592
00:44:19,822 --> 00:44:22,258
Now, that's enough, Friels.

593
00:44:22,325 --> 00:44:27,896
Dr. Thomas, I truly am sorry 
that your student is
no longer with us.

594

But don't blame me.

with some company tonight.

What the hell happened
to the security light?

712
00:54:45,414 --> 00:54:46,547
This way.

713
00:54:59,328 --> 00:55:01,496
Derek,
check the perimeter.

714
00:55:12,942 --> 00:55:15,477
With all that gunfire,
it's probably halfway
to the Gulf by now!

715
00:55:15,544 --> 00:55:18,513
Oh, I'm banking
there's a creature carcass
out there somewhere.

We'll pick up the pieces
in the morning.

a scientific expedition,

thanking your lucky stars

add protection?

723
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:41,503

over a barrel, Doc,

grabbing your ankles.

Get away from me, Kleeger.

It's not exactly what you'd 
expected, is it?

No, it isn't.
