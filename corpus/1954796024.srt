1
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:35,434
<i>This is the one
and only PBR World Final!</i>

2
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:40,841
<i>Luke Collins is young,
easy on the eyes,</i>

3
00:00:40,843 --> 00:00:42,776
<i>and a magician on a bull.</i>

4
00:00:42,778 --> 00:00:47,381
<i>But right now, he's about
to face his ultimate demon.</i>

5
00:00:47,383 --> 00:00:50,951
<i>He is about to ride a bull
who needs no introduction.</i>

6
00:00:50,953 --> 00:00:55,789
<i>This bull has 74
consecutive buck-offs.</i>

7
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:59,460
<i>Las Vegas, you know who
I'm talking about.</i>

8
00:01:00,496 --> 00:01:03,631
<i>This is Rango!</i>

9
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:44,049
And he is ready to
rock and roll!

10
00:01:49,224 --> 00:01:50,191
Let go!

11
00:02:03,405 --> 00:02:05,139
<i>Wait a minute!</i>

12
00:02:08,477 --> 00:02:10,412
<i>Luke Collins is down.</i>

13
00:02:32,936 --> 00:02:34,403
Hey, do you guys know
where Sophia is?

14
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:36,038
No, sorry.

15
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,740
Tell them to save our seats.

16
00:02:38,274 --> 00:02:39,374
Did you see Sophia?

17
00:02:39,376 --> 00:02:40,876
She's in her room studying.

18
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:42,778
But you're not
gonna get her to go.

19
00:02:46,517 --> 00:02:48,518
Hi, Marcia.
Thanks for not disturbing.

20
00:02:49,887 --> 00:02:51,955
I have a present for you.

21
00:02:51,957 --> 00:02:53,056
Wait.
You were serious?

22
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,524
Do I look serious?

23
00:02:55,526 --> 00:02:57,292
No, you look ridiculous.

24
00:02:57,294 --> 00:02:59,161
Oh, come on, Soph.
They're so much fun.

25
00:02:59,163 --> 00:03:00,829
I can't.
I have work to do.

26
00:03:00,831 --> 00:03:02,197
It's second semester
senior year.

27
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,934
Your grades are stellar.

28
00:03:04,936 --> 00:03:07,771
You already have a job
lined up in New York.

29
00:03:07,773 --> 00:03:09,139
An internship. All of the
work and none of the pay.

30
00:03:09,141 --> 00:03:10,840
Half the house is going.

31
00:03:10,842 --> 00:03:12,942
I don't see myself
as a rodeo gal.

32
00:03:12,944 --> 00:03:14,377
Fine. It's not the rodeo,
it's bull riding.

33
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,247
You're missing the point.

34
00:03:17,249 --> 00:03:18,782
Hot guys, I know.

35
00:03:18,784 --> 00:03:20,350
No, not "hot guys. "

36
00:03:20,352 --> 00:03:22,353
The hottest guys
you have ever seen.

37
00:03:24,522 --> 00:03:26,322
Please.

38
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:28,925
Fine.

39
00:03:30,562 --> 00:03:32,495
But I'm not wearing
those cowboy boots.

40
00:03:36,367 --> 00:03:38,067
So, this is it, huh?

41
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:40,538
Yeah, this is it.
"The toughest sport on dirt"!

42
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,473
Yeah,
I need a hot cowboy.

43
00:03:49,915 --> 00:03:50,981
Whoa!

44
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,537
Oh, my God!
Whoa!

45
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:15,140
What was that?

46
00:04:19,947 --> 00:04:25,115
<i>Fans, we're gonna go now to
the Ridin' Dirty bucking chute...</i>

47
00:04:25,117 --> 00:04:27,151
<i>where we have got
local hero Luke Collins</i>

48
00:04:27,153 --> 00:04:28,118
<i>from Walkertown,
North Carolina!</i>

49
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,920
Go, Luke!

50
00:04:37,396 --> 00:04:40,999
<i>He's a three-time PBR
World Finals champion.</i>

51
00:04:41,001 --> 00:04:43,935
<i>For over a year,
an injury has sidelined him.</i>

52
00:04:44,537 --> 00:04:46,238
<i>But he's back.</i>

53
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,074
<i>Currently ranked
52nd in the world.</i>

54
00:04:49,076 --> 00:04:50,276
<i>He has a long way to go.</i>

55
00:04:55,014 --> 00:04:56,581
You ready for this?

56
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:57,916
We'll see.

57
00:05:10,398 --> 00:05:14,433
<i>And today, he will be riding
Sweet Thang.</i>

58
00:05:41,595 --> 00:05:42,528
Let's go!

59
00:05:56,143 --> 00:05:57,076
Yeah, go!

60
00:06:04,218 --> 00:06:05,352
Whoo! Yeah!

61
00:06:10,425 --> 00:06:13,293
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have ourselves a champion.

62
00:06:13,295 --> 00:06:15,729
Yeah! That's my boy!

63
00:06:15,731 --> 00:06:17,531
I feel like I should stand!

64
00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:19,432
<i>Luke Collins
now moves up...</i>

65
00:06:19,434 --> 00:06:21,101
<i>to 48th in the
world standings.</i>

66
00:06:41,657 --> 00:06:42,623
Hey!

67
00:06:46,061 --> 00:06:47,128
Keep it.

68
00:06:57,373 --> 00:06:59,073
Oh!

69
00:06:59,075 --> 00:07:00,441
Work it, girl.

70
00:07:05,014 --> 00:07:06,147
It's so big on you.
I know.

71
00:07:51,127 --> 00:07:52,094
Nice riding, cowboy.

72
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:55,431
Of course, my grandma could have
made the eight on Sweet Thang.

73
00:07:56,433 --> 00:07:58,233
It's good to have
you back, Luke.

74
00:07:58,235 --> 00:07:59,568
It was getting too
easy without you.

75
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:01,270
Jared!

76
00:08:02,272 --> 00:08:03,705
Hey, buddy.
I'll be right back.

77
00:08:03,707 --> 00:08:05,474
Hey, Larry.

78
00:08:05,476 --> 00:08:07,377
Good to see you.
Good to see you here.

79
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:08,812
Luke, hey, man.
How are you doing?

80
00:08:08,814 --> 00:08:11,815
I know it feels good to get a
win under your belt, doesn't it?

81
00:08:11,817 --> 00:08:13,349
Sure does.
Yeah.

82
00:08:13,351 --> 00:08:15,351
Let me ask you.
You need to come visit us.

83
00:08:15,353 --> 00:08:17,352
I wanna introduce you to
some good folks from PBR.

84
00:08:17,354 --> 00:08:18,654
Important folk.
Come get a beer.

85
00:08:18,656 --> 00:08:20,089
You got it.
I'll be right behind you.

86
00:08:20,091 --> 00:08:21,557
Yes.
Okay.

87
00:08:22,225 --> 00:08:23,125
Hey, um...

88
00:08:23,626 --> 00:08:25,127
You had a good night.

89
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,664
But it's a long way
back to the top.

90
00:08:38,876 --> 00:08:39,843
I got a hat just like that.

91
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:44,782
Yeah.
Sorry.

92
00:08:44,784 --> 00:08:47,317
No, you hold on to it.
Looks better on you.

93
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,155
Like this?

94
00:08:57,361 --> 00:08:58,495
May I?

95
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,630
Sure.

96
00:09:05,904 --> 00:09:07,805
Uh-huh.

97
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:09,807
Yeah.
Okay.

98
00:09:11,643 --> 00:09:12,710
Beautiful.

99
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,150
Luke.

100
00:09:19,152 --> 00:09:20,518
Sophia.

101
00:09:24,723 --> 00:09:25,890
I'm gonna... Can I...
Can I get you a drink?

102
00:09:33,832 --> 00:09:37,335
I think I should be the one
buying you a beer.

103
00:09:37,337 --> 00:09:38,870
Oh, no. Doesn't work like
that where I'm from.

104
00:09:40,806 --> 00:09:42,507
Okay.

105
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:43,908
You're buying.

106
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:47,745
Sophia!

107
00:09:47,747 --> 00:09:49,547
Hi! Whoa.
There you are.

108
00:09:49,549 --> 00:09:52,349
I've been looking
all over for you.

109
00:09:52,351 --> 00:09:53,484
Um, this is Marcia.
She's my...

110
00:09:53,952 --> 00:09:55,353
Sister.

111
00:09:55,355 --> 00:09:56,621
Sorority sister.

112
00:09:57,523 --> 00:10:00,625
BFFs, if we're
speaking technically.

113
00:10:02,662 --> 00:10:03,795
You are gorgeous.

114
00:10:05,365 --> 00:10:07,232
Time to put you in a cab.
What?

115
00:10:07,234 --> 00:10:08,934
I just need everything
to stop spinning for a sec.

116
00:10:10,836 --> 00:10:12,504
I'm gonna be sick.

117
00:10:12,506 --> 00:10:14,272
What?
I think I'm gonna be sick.

118
00:10:14,274 --> 00:10:15,407
How sure?
High 90s.

119
00:10:16,842 --> 00:10:17,909
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa!

120
00:10:18,945 --> 00:10:20,478
Yeah. We got her.

121
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,813
Okay.

122
00:10:21,815 --> 00:10:24,716
I should take her home.

123
00:10:24,718 --> 00:10:26,284
Yeah. Probably a good idea.

124
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,820
I would say that I'd call you...

125
00:10:28,822 --> 00:10:30,288
but I have a feeling,
where you come from...

126
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,657
it just doesn't work like that.

127
00:10:32,392 --> 00:10:33,859
That's right.

128
00:10:33,861 --> 00:10:35,494
I'll call you?

129
00:10:36,563 --> 00:10:38,898
You're telling me
that he has called you,

130
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,766
and you haven't
called him back?

131
00:10:40,768 --> 00:10:42,968
I'm moving to New York in two months.
What's the point?

132
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,869
What's the point?

133
00:10:44,871 --> 00:10:47,472
Have you gotten
a good look at him?

134
00:10:47,474 --> 00:10:51,377
Those shoulders, those eyes.
That's the point.

135
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:53,746
Okay, look. I am starting
a new chapter of my life.

136
00:10:53,748 --> 00:10:55,915
I do not need any distractions.

137
00:10:55,917 --> 00:10:57,750
Sophia, you are literally
the only girl I know...

138
00:10:57,752 --> 00:10:59,352
who wouldn't have
a fling with a cowboy.

139
00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:43,530
Okay.

140
00:11:54,567 --> 00:11:57,847
Straight to voicemail.
Straight to voicemail.

141
00:11:58,446 --> 00:11:59,646
<i>Hello?</i>

142
00:11:59,648 --> 00:12:02,083
Hey, Luke.
It's Sophia.

143
00:12:02,085 --> 00:12:04,452
<i>I was wondering if maybe you
wanted to hang out sometime...</i>

144
00:12:04,454 --> 00:12:05,987
<i>or grab coffee
or something.</i>

145
00:12:05,989 --> 00:12:07,722
No, I'm okay.

146
00:12:09,358 --> 00:12:10,390
Okay.

147
00:12:12,393 --> 00:12:13,860
Uh, well, I guess I should
just let you go, then.

148
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,030
I'm just messing
with you, Sophia.

149
00:12:20,336 --> 00:12:21,102
How about dinner?

150
00:12:22,404 --> 00:12:24,038
You mean, like a date?

151
00:12:24,807 --> 00:12:26,074
Yeah, like a date.

152
00:12:26,642 --> 00:12:28,843
Wow!

153
00:12:28,845 --> 00:12:31,412
Most guys, they just say,
"What are you doing later?"

154
00:12:31,414 --> 00:12:33,715
Or they text late at night,
"Hey, come over. "

155
00:12:33,717 --> 00:12:37,386
Yeah, well,
call me old-school.

156
00:12:37,388 --> 00:12:39,054
<i>Should I meet you
somewhere?</i>

157
00:12:39,056 --> 00:12:40,888
<i>No. I'll pick you
up at your place.</i>

158
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,523
<i>Does 6:00 work for you?</i>

159
00:12:42,525 --> 00:12:43,624
Okay.

160
00:13:16,026 --> 00:13:17,159
Ladies.

161
00:13:32,843 --> 00:13:34,144
Hi.

162
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,945
Hi.
I know you.

163
00:13:35,947 --> 00:13:37,881
Marcia, right?
Mmm-hmm.

164
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:39,715
The last time
I saw you...

165
00:13:39,717 --> 00:13:41,150
you were a little blurry.

166
00:13:41,551 --> 00:13:42,951
Yeah.

167
00:13:42,953 --> 00:13:45,421
You can come in.
Thank you.

168
00:13:45,423 --> 00:13:46,822
She's upstairs getting ready.

169
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,960
Hi.

170
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:53,096
Hi.

171
00:13:53,631 --> 00:13:54,631
Hi.

172
00:13:58,135 --> 00:13:59,102
Um...

173
00:13:59,703 --> 00:14:00,637
Thank you.

174
00:14:01,105 --> 00:14:02,439
So sweet.

175
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,542
He's even bought her flowers.

176
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:09,612
Shall we?

177
00:14:09,614 --> 00:14:10,680
Yeah.

178
00:14:12,516 --> 00:14:14,551
- Good night, ladies.
- Good night, you guys.

179
00:14:17,121 --> 00:14:18,888
Oh, my God!

180
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,590
I want a cowboy!

181
00:14:20,592 --> 00:14:22,058
He is so hot!

182
00:14:26,998 --> 00:14:29,967
Uh... Yeah, well, it's the
cheapest rent on campus.

183
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:34,572
Is it like I would imagine?

184
00:14:36,241 --> 00:14:38,041
How would you imagine?

185
00:14:38,809 --> 00:14:40,543
Eh...

186
00:14:40,545 --> 00:14:42,179
Pillow fights
in your underwear.

187
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:43,714
No.
Come on!

188
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:48,118
We don't wear underwear.

189
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:56,527
I got you, a little.
Uh-huh. You did.

190
00:14:58,029 --> 00:14:59,798
Okay. So where are we going?

191
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:01,600
That's a surprise.

192
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:36,701
It's breathtaking.

193
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,272
Yeah.

194
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:46,177
Well, aren't you
full of surprises?

195
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,981
I can't believe you
made dinner for me.

196
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:51,216
Well, Amy made dinner.

197
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,955
Who is Amy?
Smokin' Amy's.

198
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:58,925
Best barbecue
in North Carolina.

199
00:16:01,862 --> 00:16:04,196
I kind of got into that and classical,
which is so strange.

200
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:06,831
I know. It's weird.
It's totally like...

201
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,867
How did a girl from Rutherford,
New Jersey end up

202
00:16:08,869 --> 00:16:10,268
in the middle of North Carolina?

203
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,971
Yeah,
something like that.

204
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,676
I ended up getting a scholarship
down here, so I couldn't pass it up.

205
00:16:16,678 --> 00:16:20,079
Scholarship?
Pretty fancy.

206
00:16:20,081 --> 00:16:22,715
I kind of knew that tips
from my dad's diner...

207
00:16:22,717 --> 00:16:24,717
weren't really going to cut it.

208
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:28,054
I just...

209
00:16:28,056 --> 00:16:30,958
I love art.

210
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,026
I love everything about it.
I love studying it.

211
00:16:33,028 --> 00:16:35,127
I love the culture
that it brings...

212
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:37,830
and the whole
human experience...

213
00:16:37,832 --> 00:16:39,332
just all wrapped up into one.

214
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,602
Anger, sadness...

215
00:16:42,604 --> 00:16:44,670
love, passion, acceptance...

216
00:16:44,672 --> 00:16:46,305
history.

217
00:16:49,911 --> 00:16:51,778
Never mind. I don't know.
What about you?

218
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,080
Tell me about you.
What's your story?

219
00:16:53,082 --> 00:16:56,116
No, mine's, uh...

220
00:16:56,118 --> 00:16:58,118
Mine's pretty simple.

221
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,621
Just keep winning events.

222
00:17:00,623 --> 00:17:03,222
Make it to the top 35.

223
00:17:03,224 --> 00:17:05,626
Go to Vegas.
Make it to the finals.

224
00:17:07,762 --> 00:17:08,829
I got some making up to do.

225
00:17:08,831 --> 00:17:11,031
I got hurt last year.

226
00:17:12,934 --> 00:17:14,868
What do you mean
you got hurt?

227
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,803
All bull riders get hurt.

228
00:17:17,271 --> 00:17:19,840
It's not "if. "

229
00:17:20,308 --> 00:17:22,042
It's "when. "

230
00:17:23,646 --> 00:17:24,846
And how bad.

231
00:17:26,382 --> 00:17:28,983
How bad was yours?
Serious?

232
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:33,654
I've got a few
more years to ride...

233
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:37,257
before I'm just
a washed-up bull rider.

234
00:17:40,128 --> 00:17:41,262
I'm going to be the best.

235
00:17:42,965 --> 00:17:44,232
It's just all about winning?

236
00:17:44,234 --> 00:17:45,099
No, it's not all about winning.

237
00:17:46,301 --> 00:17:48,102
Well, not entirely.

238
00:17:50,806 --> 00:17:53,441
I've got a family ranch.

239
00:17:53,443 --> 00:17:55,276
It's been a tough couple years.

240
00:17:55,278 --> 00:17:58,747
My mom is kind of
all on her own.

241
00:17:59,983 --> 00:18:01,883
I just gotta keep
making money.

242
00:18:03,752 --> 00:18:04,719
Mmm.

243
00:18:07,923 --> 00:18:09,991
Are you cold? You're cold.

244
00:18:10,793 --> 00:18:12,026
A little.

245
00:18:12,028 --> 00:18:14,195
Where are you going?

246
00:18:16,331 --> 00:18:19,702
What do they call
this nail polish color?

247
00:18:19,704 --> 00:18:21,070
This would be "clear. "

248
00:18:21,072 --> 00:18:23,338
Clear.
Yeah.

249
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,907
Right. Clear.
That makes sense.

250
00:18:27,477 --> 00:18:28,444
It's good.

251
00:18:32,114 --> 00:18:35,117
You are pretty smooth
for a country boy.

252
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:36,285
Me?

253
00:18:36,287 --> 00:18:37,286
Yeah, you.

254
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:42,424
Come on, I saw the way
those girls stared at you.

255
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,761
You think I'm that type of guy?

256
00:18:48,465 --> 00:18:50,466
No.

257
00:18:50,468 --> 00:18:52,902
No one has ever done anything
like this for me before.

258
00:19:05,315 --> 00:19:07,382
So, uh, do you like
North Carolina?

259
00:19:09,185 --> 00:19:10,820
Yeah, I do.

260
00:19:11,856 --> 00:19:13,123
It's beautiful.
Yeah.

261
00:19:15,793 --> 00:19:17,761
Um...

262
00:19:17,763 --> 00:19:21,264
I'm actually moving to New York
at the end of next month.

263
00:19:24,235 --> 00:19:26,336
I got this job.

264
00:19:28,139 --> 00:19:31,508
Well, it's an internship,
actually.

265
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,476
But it's a pretty big deal.
It's at a gallery in Manhattan.

266
00:19:35,012 --> 00:19:36,279
Okay.

267
00:19:38,983 --> 00:19:39,916
Uh...

268
00:19:41,285 --> 00:19:44,454
That's why it took me so long
to call you back.

269
00:19:44,456 --> 00:19:46,423
I just didn't think that this
would even be a good idea.

270
00:19:47,993 --> 00:19:49,426
I'm glad you did.

271
00:19:51,163 --> 00:19:52,429
Yeah?
Yeah.

272
00:19:56,034 --> 00:19:57,968
This is just bad timing.

273
00:19:59,236 --> 00:20:00,804
Yeah.

274
00:20:05,177 --> 00:20:06,510
Oh, I probably should
take you home.

275
00:20:08,246 --> 00:20:09,246
Gonna rain.

276
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,527
Did you see that?

277
00:20:22,529 --> 00:20:23,929
What?

278
00:20:36,374 --> 00:20:37,408
Luke!

279
00:20:37,943 --> 00:20:39,443
What is it?

280
00:20:45,351 --> 00:20:47,118
Call 911!

281
00:20:55,494 --> 00:20:56,628
Hey!
Wake up!

282
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,029
Is he alive?

283
00:20:58,031 --> 00:20:59,164
Here, hold this.

284
00:21:11,043 --> 00:21:12,043
Box.

285
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:14,946
Box.

286
00:21:14,948 --> 00:21:16,148
What did he say?
"Box"?

287
00:21:46,647 --> 00:21:49,115
I think you just
saved that guy's life.

288
00:21:49,117 --> 00:21:50,950
We both did.

289
00:21:50,952 --> 00:21:52,519
Oh, come on,
I held the flashlight.

290
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:54,488
You were amazing.

291
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:59,358
I just hope that he's okay.

292
00:22:00,994 --> 00:22:02,628
I'll take you home.

293
00:22:03,964 --> 00:22:05,498
I think I'm going to stay.

294
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,465
Really?

295
00:22:08,101 --> 00:22:10,370
Yeah, at least until he gets
out of the emergency room.

296
00:22:11,139 --> 00:22:12,239
Then I'll wait with you.

297
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:14,441
No, it's fine.

298
00:22:14,443 --> 00:22:15,442
Really.

299
00:22:16,477 --> 00:22:18,512
And thank you for tonight.

300
00:22:19,948 --> 00:22:21,248
Yeah, it was a...

301
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,116
It was a great night.

302
00:22:23,118 --> 00:22:24,251
Kind of.

303
00:22:27,456 --> 00:22:30,057
Good luck with
everything in New York.

304
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:31,458
Mmm-hmm.

305
00:23:55,711 --> 00:23:58,647
"April 10th, 1940.

306
00:23:58,649 --> 00:24:01,150
<i>"My dearest Ruth...</i>

307
00:24:01,152 --> 00:24:04,653
<i>"Today started out

<i>"But when you walked in

309
00:24:07,191 --> 00:24:09,725
<i>"so beautiful, so vibrant...</i>

310
00:24:11,362 --> 00:24:13,462
<i>"I knew my life would
forever be changed. "</i>

311
00:24:17,668 --> 00:24:19,569
You are the new family
the Rabbi has told us about.

312
00:24:20,604 --> 00:24:21,504
From Vienna?

313
00:24:22,306 --> 00:24:23,405
Uh, yes.

314
00:24:23,407 --> 00:24:25,240
I am Hannah...

315
00:24:25,242 --> 00:24:27,476
and this is my daughter,
Ruth.

316
00:24:27,478 --> 00:24:28,744
Nice to meet you.

317
00:24:28,746 --> 00:24:30,813
I'm Sarah...

318
00:24:30,815 --> 00:24:33,616
and this is my son, Ira.

319
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:36,619
Ira?

320
00:24:37,154 --> 00:24:38,354
Ira?

321
00:24:53,604 --> 00:24:55,138
<i>- Good Shabbes.
- Good Shabbes.</i>

322
00:25:02,146 --> 00:25:03,213
<i>Good Shabbes.</i>

323
00:25:04,548 --> 00:25:05,548
<i>Good Sha...</i>

324
00:25:07,418 --> 00:25:09,487
<i>The following days
were consumed...</i>

325
00:25:09,489 --> 00:25:12,556
<i>with plotting ways in which
I could talk to you...</i>

326
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:15,292
<i>now that you had found a home
in my small community.</i>

327
00:25:39,684 --> 00:25:42,853
<i>But I wasn't the only one
seeking your attention.</i>

328
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,327
<i>This would take
some more time.</i>

329
00:26:02,708 --> 00:26:04,442
He's awake,
if you'd like to see him.

330
00:26:04,444 --> 00:26:06,178
You have to eat something,
Mr. Levinson.

331
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,512
It's the only way you're
going to get better.

332
00:26:07,514 --> 00:26:08,847
I'm old.

333
00:26:08,849 --> 00:26:10,615
I've had a heart attack...

334
00:26:10,617 --> 00:26:12,250
a hip replacement...

335
00:26:12,252 --> 00:26:13,485
surgery in both knees.

336
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,354
How much better
am I going to get?

337
00:26:20,893 --> 00:26:21,860
Who are you?

338
00:26:23,462 --> 00:26:25,730
I, uh...
I came to drop this off.

339
00:26:25,732 --> 00:26:26,631
How'd you get that?

340
00:26:27,867 --> 00:26:29,401
From your car.

341
00:26:29,403 --> 00:26:31,236
You asked me
to get it for you.

342
00:26:31,704 --> 00:26:32,904
Oh, you...

343
00:26:34,373 --> 00:26:36,408
You pulled me out?

344
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:38,411
No, my friend Luke
pulled you out...

345
00:26:38,413 --> 00:26:39,979
but you asked me to go
back and get this box.

346
00:26:43,383 --> 00:26:44,450
You don't remember?

347
00:26:44,585 --> 00:26:45,785
Hmm.

348
00:26:47,754 --> 00:26:49,854
Well, thank you.

349
00:26:51,591 --> 00:26:53,725
Very much.

350
00:26:53,727 --> 00:26:57,430
He seems to like you,
which is a first for him.

351
00:26:57,432 --> 00:26:59,532
See if you can get him to
eat something, would you?

352
00:27:01,902 --> 00:27:05,271
She has the coldest hands
I've ever felt.

353
00:27:06,473 --> 00:27:08,274
I think she soaks
them in ice water...

354
00:27:08,276 --> 00:27:09,675
before she comes by.

355
00:27:19,553 --> 00:27:21,520
You really should
eat something.

356
00:27:21,522 --> 00:27:22,788
I'm done.

357
00:27:34,769 --> 00:27:36,436
Is that what
Ruth would want?

358
00:27:39,807 --> 00:27:42,009
How do you know about Ruth?

359
00:27:42,011 --> 00:27:43,477
Did you read my letters?

360
00:27:43,479 --> 00:27:45,312
What do you care?

361
00:27:45,314 --> 00:27:46,680
You're done.

362
00:27:52,553 --> 00:27:54,421
They're beautiful.

363
00:28:00,795 --> 00:28:02,863
She was a beautiful woman.

364
00:28:06,367 --> 00:28:08,336
In every way.

365
00:28:11,507 --> 00:28:14,809
I can see why they were
so precious to you.

366
00:28:32,895 --> 00:28:35,997
I haven't been able
to read them for years.

367
00:28:35,999 --> 00:28:39,000
Even with my glasses.

368
00:28:39,002 --> 00:28:40,735
Do you want me
to read them to you?

369
00:28:52,081 --> 00:28:53,648
But you have to eat first.

370
00:29:11,768 --> 00:29:14,903
"May 25th, 1940.

371
00:29:14,905 --> 00:29:17,004
"For the first time in my life...

372
00:29:17,006 --> 00:29:21,043
"I was hoping the service at the
synagogue would be longer. "

373
00:29:31,621 --> 00:29:32,888
Excuse me.

374
00:29:43,135 --> 00:29:44,700
Are you ever going
to talk to me?

375
00:29:47,871 --> 00:29:49,671
Excuse me?

376
00:29:49,673 --> 00:29:51,707
I always see you there,
lurking around.

377
00:29:53,843 --> 00:29:55,043
I don't lurk.

378
00:29:55,045 --> 00:29:57,747
You do lurk.

379
00:29:57,749 --> 00:30:00,583
But then you never talk to me.
Am I so frightening?

380
00:30:01,685 --> 00:30:02,786
No, I...

381
00:30:08,627 --> 00:30:11,728
What you did to that poor
rose was unforgiveable.

382
00:30:13,698 --> 00:30:14,931
You saw that?

383
00:30:18,002 --> 00:30:20,770
Don't be embarrassed.
It was a lovely gesture.

384
00:30:20,772 --> 00:30:21,838
Ruthie?

385
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:25,942
Want to walk me home?

386
00:30:26,911 --> 00:30:28,144
Oh...

387
00:30:28,146 --> 00:30:29,779
What about David Stein?

388
00:30:29,781 --> 00:30:31,549
He can walk my mother home.

389
00:30:34,487 --> 00:30:37,621
Vienna is beautiful
and so cultured.

390
00:30:37,623 --> 00:30:39,490
It has more artists than Paris.

391
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:43,927
At least it did before the war.

392
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:45,695
It must have been
hard for you to leave.

393
00:30:45,697 --> 00:30:46,863
Yeah.

394
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:51,702
Especially for my parents.

395
00:30:51,704 --> 00:30:53,704
But it would have been worse
if we had stayed.

396
00:30:57,142 --> 00:30:59,143
Everyone thought
we were being foolish...

397
00:30:59,145 --> 00:31:02,246
that my father
was overreacting.

398
00:31:02,248 --> 00:31:03,714
Now we can't even contact
our relatives anymore.

399
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:10,021
what right do I have
to be happy

400
00:31:10,023 --> 00:31:11,656
when there's so much
suffering in the world?

401
00:31:13,225 --> 00:31:15,626
I guess you could say, what right
do you have to be unhappy?

402
00:31:18,864 --> 00:31:20,664
True.

403
00:31:20,666 --> 00:31:23,200
For a country pumpkin,
you're quite philosophical.

404
00:31:25,238 --> 00:31:27,539
What?

405
00:31:27,541 --> 00:31:29,241
It's a "country bumpkin"
not a "country pumpkin. "

406
00:31:30,142 --> 00:31:31,176
What?

407
00:31:33,045 --> 00:31:34,913
I think I prefer the
way you said it.

408
00:31:40,686 --> 00:31:41,586
Well.

409
00:31:43,222 --> 00:31:45,590
Thank you for walking me home.

410
00:31:45,592 --> 00:31:47,192
Oh, you're welcome.

411
00:31:47,194 --> 00:31:48,693
It was a pleasure.

412
00:32:02,676 --> 00:32:03,676
Ruth...

413
00:32:07,781 --> 00:32:08,948
Do you want to go
out with me sometime?

414
00:32:12,018 --> 00:32:13,585
I'm free after Shabbat.

415
00:32:16,188 --> 00:32:17,856
Wait. You want
to go out tonight?

416
00:32:17,858 --> 00:32:19,992
We're not getting
any younger, Levinson.

417
00:32:21,828 --> 00:32:23,596
You can wait there
if you want.

418
00:32:31,706 --> 00:32:33,839
"Forever yours...

419
00:32:34,308 --> 00:32:35,575
"Ira. "

420
00:32:41,848 --> 00:32:42,982
You want me to read
you another one?

421
00:32:44,818 --> 00:32:45,851
Mmm.

422
00:32:49,056 --> 00:32:50,990
But...

423
00:32:52,593 --> 00:32:53,726
Could you maybe...

424
00:32:55,663 --> 00:32:57,130
Could you maybe come back?

425
00:33:08,242 --> 00:33:10,109
Carolina Thunder's
a good draw.

426
00:33:10,979 --> 00:33:15,682
<i>Savannah, Georgia fans,
put your hands together...</i>

427
00:33:15,684 --> 00:33:19,152
<i>for the one,
the only, Rango!</i>

428
00:33:29,931 --> 00:33:33,034
<i>We will move our attention down
to the Cooper Tires bucking chute...</i>

429
00:33:33,036 --> 00:33:37,271
<i>where Evan Matthews from Summerville,
Georgia is set to go.</i>

430
00:33:37,273 --> 00:33:40,407
<i>He is about to face a bull
that needs no introduction.</i>

431
00:33:40,409 --> 00:33:42,142
<i>85 consecutive buck-offs...</i>

432
00:33:48,082 --> 00:33:50,318
<i>He is going
for the Gold Buckle.</i>

433
00:34:00,863 --> 00:34:01,863
That looks familiar.

434
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:16,344
<i>Let's go to Luke Collins.</i>

435
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:19,747
<i>If he makes a qualified ride
on Carolina Thunder...</i>

436
00:34:19,749 --> 00:34:22,950
<i>he will crack the top 35 and
punch his ticket to Vegas!</i>

437
00:34:22,952 --> 00:34:23,851
Let's go!

438
00:34:31,394 --> 00:34:33,762
<i>He comes down too early</i>

439
00:34:33,764 --> 00:34:34,797
<i>in a costly mistake.</i>

440
00:34:34,799 --> 00:34:38,433
<i>A mistake that could cost him
a trip to the World Finals...</i>

441
00:34:38,435 --> 00:34:40,935
<i>and ultimately,
a World Title.</i>

442
00:34:40,937 --> 00:34:43,305
<i>You really gotta wonder...</i>

443
00:34:43,307 --> 00:34:45,240
<i>where this guy is
mentally right now.</i>

444
00:34:45,242 --> 00:34:47,242
<i>The incident with
Rango before he rode...</i>

445
00:34:47,244 --> 00:34:48,844
Good ride, Luke.

446
00:34:48,846 --> 00:34:50,447
<i>...has affected
his mental focus.</i>

447
00:35:04,495 --> 00:35:05,962
Damn it!

448
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,508
Return of the conquering hero.

449
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:54,178
Hey, Mom.

450
00:35:56,414 --> 00:35:58,182
You want eggs?
No.

451
00:36:00,452 --> 00:36:01,452
So, how did it go?

452
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:08,124
Well, you left the ring
on your own two feet.

453
00:36:08,126 --> 00:36:10,260
So, it's a victory for me.

454
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:13,097
When are you gonna
stop the bull riding, Luke?

455
00:36:15,233 --> 00:36:17,535
Mom, I told you, I can't.

456
00:36:17,537 --> 00:36:20,137
Really? So you forgot
about your head injury?

457
00:36:20,139 --> 00:36:21,438
I'm a grown man.

458
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,007
I just want you to get
to be an old man.

459
00:36:25,277 --> 00:36:26,377
Thanks.

460
00:36:32,985 --> 00:36:34,119
You're scaring the
hell out of me, Luke.

461
00:36:35,153 --> 00:36:36,587
Please just give it up.
Don't worry.

462
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:42,893
So, what's going on?

463
00:36:45,997 --> 00:36:47,298
Nothing.

464
00:36:49,602 --> 00:36:50,569
Nothing.

465
00:36:55,541 --> 00:36:57,442
I met a girl.

466
00:36:57,444 --> 00:36:59,010
You meet girls all the time.
No.

467
00:37:00,546 --> 00:37:03,048
This one's different.

468
00:37:05,151 --> 00:37:06,051
I can't stop
thinking about her.

469
00:37:06,586 --> 00:37:08,520
So?

470
00:37:08,522 --> 00:37:10,555
She moves to New York
in two months.

471
00:37:11,991 --> 00:37:15,360
So, I guess
that's that, right?

472
00:37:16,362 --> 00:37:18,263
You soak your hand
in ice water.

473
00:37:18,265 --> 00:37:18,997
I do no such thing.

474
00:37:18,999 --> 00:37:22,467
I'm the only person at the
hospital who still talks to you.

475
00:37:22,469 --> 00:37:23,368
Am I interrupting?

476
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:26,339
I was just about to
strangle him! But...

477
00:37:26,341 --> 00:37:28,140
Strangle me before dinner...

478
00:37:28,142 --> 00:37:29,609
so I don't have to eat
another hospital meal.

479
00:37:29,611 --> 00:37:30,877
The sooner the better.

480
00:37:32,312 --> 00:37:33,278
Enjoy his letters.

481
00:37:37,049 --> 00:37:38,016
You look good.

482
00:37:40,553 --> 00:37:41,520
Shall we?

483
00:37:42,155 --> 00:37:43,122
Yeah.

484
00:38:00,675 --> 00:38:03,342
"July 12th, 1941. "
Oh.

485
00:38:06,948 --> 00:38:08,681
That was a good day.

486
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:14,987
"Dearest Ruth, the memories
of our adventure...

487
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:18,558
"are always dancing in my mind. "

488
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,295
<i>Seems like yesterday...</i>

489
00:38:21,297 --> 00:38:24,064
<i>you helped me see the world
in a whole different way.</i>

490
00:38:24,066 --> 00:38:26,700
all dressed up just
to go to a movie.

491
00:38:26,702 --> 00:38:29,336
In Vienna,
everyone always dresses up.

492
00:38:29,338 --> 00:38:31,672
Even just to stroll
in the park. It's elegant.

493
00:38:31,674 --> 00:38:34,240
It is also July in North Carolina.

494
00:38:34,242 --> 00:38:35,642
Oh, let me show you something.
I have to show you something!

495
00:38:35,644 --> 00:38:37,210
What?

496
00:38:37,212 --> 00:38:39,212
Ruth, we're going to be late.

497
00:38:52,694 --> 00:38:55,229
It's by an artist
in Black Mountain.

498
00:38:55,231 --> 00:38:57,432
What's Black Mountain?
It's an arts college.

499
00:38:57,434 --> 00:38:59,467
A whole movement,
right here in North Carolina.

500
00:39:00,703 --> 00:39:01,635
And isn't it wonderful?

501
00:39:03,004 --> 00:39:04,738
Such a personal landscape.

502
00:39:05,606 --> 00:39:08,141
It's so direct and frank.

503
00:39:09,644 --> 00:39:12,246
Simplified and distorted.

504
00:39:12,248 --> 00:39:14,215
All at the same time.

505
00:39:14,683 --> 00:39:16,150
Don't you love it?

506
00:39:20,255 --> 00:39:22,457
I love how much
you love it.

507
00:39:29,366 --> 00:39:30,332
Come on.

508
00:39:32,932 --> 00:39:33,780
What?
No, no, no.

509
00:39:33,815 --> 00:39:35,174
Excuse me.

510
00:39:44,446 --> 00:39:46,481
All right. You want to dance?
Let's dance.

511
00:39:53,723 --> 00:39:56,191
Oh!

512
00:40:07,103 --> 00:40:08,337
Wow.

513
00:40:08,805 --> 00:40:10,572
Whoo!

514
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:48,478
<i>That kiss, our first kiss...</i>

515
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,347
<i>it was a promise
of everything to come.</i>

516
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:03,626
<i>The days became months.</i>

517
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:06,663
<i>We ventured on
weekends to new places.</i>

518
00:41:06,665 --> 00:41:09,432
<i>Never once had I been
on vacation.</i>

519
00:41:09,434 --> 00:41:11,234
<i>Had I, though...</i>

520
00:41:11,236 --> 00:41:14,237
<i>it could never have been
as memorable as these.</i>

521
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:16,272
What?

522
00:41:21,413 --> 00:41:24,115
It's the first time North Carolina
has felt like home.

523
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,847
But yet, with my most
important student...

524
00:41:56,849 --> 00:41:59,283
I am a total failure.

525
00:41:59,285 --> 00:42:01,485
Ruth has fallen in love
with contemporary art.

526
00:42:01,487 --> 00:42:04,255
Father thinks that art stopped
with Matisse and Picasso.

527
00:42:04,257 --> 00:42:07,391
I don't think it stopped.
But it's taken a long nap.

528
00:42:07,393 --> 00:42:09,627
You try and raise your
children right, Ira...

529
00:42:09,629 --> 00:42:12,731
and they grow up and
think for themselves.

530
00:42:12,733 --> 00:42:14,166
Very good.
Very good.

531
00:42:14,168 --> 00:42:15,233
It's tragedy!

532
00:42:20,439 --> 00:42:23,208
It was nice seeing
you talk like that.

533
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:25,744
Nothing would make me happier
than a lifetime of days like this.

534
00:42:27,312 --> 00:42:28,713
Hey, Ruth. I need to ask
you something.

535
00:42:28,715 --> 00:42:30,248
Wait.

536
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:38,823
I want a big family.
A really big family.

537
00:42:41,827 --> 00:42:44,262
I've always wanted one
since I was a little girl.

538
00:42:46,366 --> 00:42:48,334
With everything
that's going on now...

539
00:42:49,636 --> 00:42:51,771
I feel this need,
this responsibility,

540
00:42:51,773 --> 00:42:53,539
to bring life back
into the world.

541
00:42:56,275 --> 00:42:57,876
Sounds perfect.

542
00:43:02,448 --> 00:43:03,315
You can ask me now.

543
00:43:05,652 --> 00:43:06,919
Ruth...

544
00:43:06,921 --> 00:43:09,455
I know I'm not a rich man.

545
00:43:09,457 --> 00:43:11,457
Don't know the last
thing about art.

546
00:43:12,426 --> 00:43:13,960
All I can do is promise to love you...

547
00:43:13,962 --> 00:43:14,961
every second of every day
for the rest of my life.

548
00:43:15,862 --> 00:43:17,263
Really?

549
00:43:21,368 --> 00:43:22,236
Will you marry me?

550
00:43:22,937 --> 00:43:24,605
Yes!

551
00:43:24,607 --> 00:43:27,440
Yes, yes, yes!
What took you so long?

552
00:43:32,012 --> 00:43:33,012
Welcome to the family.

553
00:43:34,481 --> 00:43:35,681
Thank you.
So good to have you.

554
00:43:39,754 --> 00:43:42,656
"With love, Ira. "

555
00:44:05,046 --> 00:44:07,047
I'll come back tomorrow.

556
00:45:04,006 --> 00:45:05,740
Mr. Levinson?
Do I know you?

557
00:45:06,675 --> 00:45:07,875
Luke Collins.

558
00:45:09,646 --> 00:45:11,880
Remember, off 119...

559
00:45:11,882 --> 00:45:14,383
when you decided to bust
open that guard rail?

560
00:45:16,853 --> 00:45:18,854
Oh, you saved my life.

561
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:21,123
Thank you.

562
00:45:21,491 --> 00:45:22,757
Hi.

563
00:45:25,561 --> 00:45:26,594
Hi.

564
00:45:30,924 --> 00:45:32,668
Is this your Luke?

565
00:45:32,703 --> 00:45:34,036
This is my friend Luke.

566
00:45:34,504 --> 00:45:35,671
Yes.

567
00:45:36,406 --> 00:45:37,873
Your friend. Hmm.

568
00:45:37,875 --> 00:45:39,074
Mmm-hmm.

569
00:45:42,545 --> 00:45:43,445
What are you doing here?

570
00:45:46,083 --> 00:45:49,119
I found this on
the floor of my truck.

571
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:51,487
Figured you might wanna
hang on to that one.

572
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:58,827
<i>December 7th, 1941.</i>

573
00:45:58,829 --> 00:46:02,698
<i>Nothing made me happier than knowing
we were going to be married.</i>

574
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,834
<i>But the world you and
your family had fled...</i>

575
00:46:05,569 --> 00:46:07,971
<i>finally caught up to us.</i>

576
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:10,673
<i>The United States
of America...</i>

577
00:46:10,675 --> 00:46:13,743
<i>was suddenly and
deliberately attacked...</i>

578
00:46:13,745 --> 00:46:16,179
<i>by Naval and Air Forces...</i>

579
00:46:16,181 --> 00:46:18,648
<i>of the Empire of Japan.</i>

580
00:46:21,552 --> 00:46:23,052
Promise me you'll come back.
I will.

581
00:46:23,054 --> 00:46:25,422
Promise me, Ira!

582
00:46:25,424 --> 00:46:26,723
I promise.

583
00:46:28,659 --> 00:46:30,427
Look at me.
I promise.

584
00:46:36,734 --> 00:46:38,635
Come back to me!

585
00:46:54,718 --> 00:46:56,019
Help!

586
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:05,062
We can't just leave
him out there.

587
00:47:07,065 --> 00:47:09,099
Help! Help me!

588
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:14,940
Somebody help me!

589
00:47:15,808 --> 00:47:16,641
I gotta save him.

590
00:47:18,478 --> 00:47:20,911
Are you crazy? Those Panzers
are 200 yards away.

591
00:47:20,913 --> 00:47:22,813
You'll never make it back.

592
00:47:22,815 --> 00:47:26,584
I'll make it back.
I made a promise I have to keep.

593
00:47:26,586 --> 00:47:29,520
You getting killed ain't gonna
help anyone but the Germans.

594
00:47:33,659 --> 00:47:35,227
Help me! Please!

595
00:47:36,662 --> 00:47:37,863
Oh, my God!

596
00:47:40,666 --> 00:47:42,667
Can somebody help me?

597
00:47:48,241 --> 00:47:49,206
Oh, shit.

598
00:47:56,616 --> 00:47:57,816
Put your arms around my neck.

599
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:06,825
I gotta get back.
I gotta get back to Ruth.

600
00:48:23,576 --> 00:48:25,544
That was goddamn crazy, Levinson.
Do you know that?

601
00:48:29,016 --> 00:48:30,616
Shit!

602
00:48:38,892 --> 00:48:40,560
I'm very sorry.

603
00:49:27,108 --> 00:49:29,743
<i>When I came back from the war,
I wasn't the same.</i>

604
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:34,181
<i>I was fighting
a bigger battle now.</i>

605
00:49:34,183 --> 00:49:37,017
<i>And I couldn't honor the
promise I had made to you.</i>

606
00:49:50,898 --> 00:49:52,633
Your mother says you've
been home since Monday.

607
00:49:59,942 --> 00:50:01,676
I can't pretend to know
what you've been through...

608
00:50:01,678 --> 00:50:03,211
but I want to help.

609
00:50:15,357 --> 00:50:17,225
Don't you think I deserve
an explanation?

610
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:23,364
Well...

611
00:50:23,366 --> 00:50:24,932
I do.

612
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:42,084
You don't understand.
It wasn't the injury itself.

613
00:50:42,086 --> 00:50:44,152
The wound got infected.

614
00:50:44,154 --> 00:50:46,187
I ran a high fever
for almost two weeks.

615
00:50:46,189 --> 00:50:48,456
You need to see more doctors.
Get a second opinion.

616
00:50:48,458 --> 00:50:50,893
Don't you think I've
already done that?

617
00:50:50,895 --> 00:50:52,795
There's nothing they can do.

618
00:50:54,998 --> 00:50:56,799
This is my life,
I have to accept it.

619
00:50:56,801 --> 00:50:57,866
But I don't want it
to be yours.

620
00:50:57,868 --> 00:50:59,301
But there is still a chance.

621
00:50:59,303 --> 00:51:01,770
I want to marry you.

622
00:51:01,772 --> 00:51:03,105
If you marry me,
you may never have a family.

623
00:51:04,941 --> 00:51:06,875
Are you honestly willing
to give that up?

624
00:51:36,841 --> 00:51:38,141
<i>The war was over...</i>

625
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:40,944
<i>and as far as I
was concerned...</i>

626
00:51:41,746 --> 00:51:44,047
<i>so was my life.</i>

627
00:51:49,487 --> 00:51:50,754
We're closed!

628
00:51:53,824 --> 00:51:55,492
I know what you're doing!

629
00:51:55,494 --> 00:51:57,127
You cannot tell me what
I'm willing to give up!

630
00:51:59,296 --> 00:52:00,864
When you went to war...

631
00:52:00,866 --> 00:52:04,168
I was here,
clinging to the hope...

632
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:06,303
that you would come home
and we would get married.

633
00:52:07,539 --> 00:52:09,807
Yes, and have kids.
But that's a dream, Ira.

634
00:52:11,777 --> 00:52:13,877
You're real.

635
00:52:13,879 --> 00:52:15,345
I don't know what
the future holds...

636
00:52:15,347 --> 00:52:17,447
but I know there's no
future without you.

637
00:52:21,853 --> 00:52:24,255
Unless you don't
love me anymore.

638
00:53:06,499 --> 00:53:08,366
<i>And in that moment...</i>

639
00:53:08,368 --> 00:53:11,302
<i>we both knew...</i>

640
00:53:11,304 --> 00:53:15,874
<i>a chance at life together was
greater than the risk of being apart.</i>

641
00:53:27,386 --> 00:53:29,287
It was really nice of you
to bring that photo.

642
00:53:30,923 --> 00:53:32,892
He sure has been through a lot.

643
00:53:32,894 --> 00:53:33,893
Yeah.

644
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:38,097
Uh...

645
00:53:38,099 --> 00:53:39,599
Well, you take it easy.

646
00:53:41,467 --> 00:53:42,400
Luke.

647
00:53:49,376 --> 00:53:50,977
It was really good to see you.

648
00:53:56,984 --> 00:53:58,985
What are you doing right now?

649
00:54:01,255 --> 00:54:02,521
That looks good.

650
00:54:02,523 --> 00:54:04,023
Yeah.

651
00:54:04,025 --> 00:54:05,524
- I'm ready.
- All right.

652
00:54:05,526 --> 00:54:07,594
I'm so ready.

653
00:54:07,596 --> 00:54:10,602
- I'll give you the little stick.
- Thank you. - Yeah.

654
00:54:10,927 --> 00:54:12,553
Ladies first.

655
00:54:13,234 --> 00:54:16,903
I'm still getting used to your
Southern gentlemanly ways.

656
00:54:16,905 --> 00:54:18,371
I'm still trying to impress you.

657
00:54:20,107 --> 00:54:21,941
It's kind of working.

658
00:54:21,943 --> 00:54:23,542
A little.
Mmm...

659
00:54:23,544 --> 00:54:26,179
Just don't let me win.

660
00:54:26,181 --> 00:54:28,115
I enjoy good,
healthy competition.

661
00:54:28,117 --> 00:54:29,049
Noted.

662
00:54:37,526 --> 00:54:39,292
What are you doing?

663
00:54:39,294 --> 00:54:40,426
You told me not
to let you win.

664
00:54:41,428 --> 00:54:44,998
So I'm going with plan B.
Distraction.

665
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,333
Hmm.

666
00:54:46,335 --> 00:54:47,601
Mmm-hmm.

667
00:54:53,574 --> 00:54:55,008
Yes!

668
00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:57,577
Yes! Sorry!

669
00:54:57,579 --> 00:54:58,312
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you very much.

670
00:54:58,314 --> 00:55:01,582
Oh, I love mac and cheese.

671
00:55:01,584 --> 00:55:02,717
Comfort food?

672
00:55:03,085 --> 00:55:04,052
Yeah.

673
00:55:05,287 --> 00:55:06,187
What's your comfort food?

674
00:55:08,589 --> 00:55:10,590
Kolduny.

675
00:55:10,592 --> 00:55:12,292
Kol-what?
Kolduny.

676
00:55:12,294 --> 00:55:14,361
They're these super,
super delicious...

677
00:55:14,363 --> 00:55:16,430
Polish meat dumplings
that my mom makes.

678
00:55:17,432 --> 00:55:19,067
We serve them at the diner...

679
00:55:19,069 --> 00:55:21,970
and I promise you,
with one bite of those...

680
00:55:21,972 --> 00:55:23,371
it would put your mac
and cheese to shame.

681
00:55:23,373 --> 00:55:24,605
Is that an invitation?

682
00:55:26,608 --> 00:55:27,675
Maybe.

683
00:55:29,211 --> 00:55:30,378
Oh. No, no.
Help yourself.

684
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:31,646
No!
Yeah.

685
00:55:31,648 --> 00:55:34,015
Just a bite.

686
00:55:34,017 --> 00:55:35,249
When did your parents
come to the States?

687
00:55:35,251 --> 00:55:36,485
Uh, before I was born.

688
00:55:37,753 --> 00:55:39,554
That's crazy.
I couldn't have done that.

689
00:55:39,556 --> 00:55:42,156
Really?
No.

690
00:55:42,158 --> 00:55:45,026
You ride bulls for a living.
You could do anything.

691
00:55:45,028 --> 00:55:47,328
Riding bulls has got nothing on
moving clear across the world.

692
00:55:47,330 --> 00:55:49,230
What?
Yeah.

693
00:55:49,232 --> 00:55:51,232
Your parents had to
adjust their whole life.

694
00:55:51,234 --> 00:55:53,368
No, they didn't
adjust anything.

695
00:55:54,604 --> 00:55:57,206
Growing up with
immigrant parents,

696
00:55:57,208 --> 00:55:59,541
my life was always
really different.

697
00:55:59,543 --> 00:56:02,011
Everyone was always screaming
in weird languages...

698
00:56:02,013 --> 00:56:04,313
I brought smelly,
strange snacks to school.

699
00:56:04,315 --> 00:56:06,714
My pants were
too short always.

700
00:56:07,516 --> 00:56:09,650
Pants still are too short.

701
00:56:09,652 --> 00:56:12,153
Growing up on a cattle ranch,
everybody I knew was the same.

702
00:56:12,155 --> 00:56:16,258
Everybody you know is fourth
generation cattle ranchers.

703
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:18,694
I'm jealous.
Why?

704
00:56:18,696 --> 00:56:20,529
I wanted to be like everyone
else when I was little.

705
00:56:22,699 --> 00:56:26,301
The reason I like you is because
you're nothing like everyone else.

706
00:56:29,639 --> 00:56:31,608
You're not so bad yourself.

707
00:56:34,545 --> 00:56:37,780
I think before I met you,
the closest thing I came to cattle was...

708
00:56:37,782 --> 00:56:39,348
steak.

709
00:56:39,350 --> 00:56:41,750
Steak? Time to get you
on a bull, then.

710
00:56:41,752 --> 00:56:43,118
A bull?
Yeah.

711
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,353
No way!

712
00:56:44,355 --> 00:56:45,721
One bull, one time.

713
00:56:45,723 --> 00:56:48,123
No! How about one horse,
one time?

714
00:56:48,793 --> 00:56:50,160
We could do that.

715
00:56:50,162 --> 00:56:51,528
Next week.
Okay.

716
00:56:54,632 --> 00:56:57,400
Ooh. I've got an idea.
Uh-oh.

717
00:56:57,402 --> 00:56:58,635
It's so good.
What?

718
00:56:58,637 --> 00:57:00,703
So good!
Come on!

719
00:57:00,705 --> 00:57:02,272
What?
Where am I going?

720
00:57:02,274 --> 00:57:04,607
Where are we going?
You'll see.

721
00:57:04,609 --> 00:57:06,609
After you.
Wow. Thank you.

722
00:57:08,179 --> 00:57:09,446
Ready?

723
00:57:11,782 --> 00:57:13,249
Crazy face.
Yeah.

724
00:57:39,844 --> 00:57:41,811
Yeah, that looks good.

725
00:57:43,381 --> 00:57:44,582
Thank you.

726
00:57:49,187 --> 00:57:50,488
Okay.

727
00:57:51,757 --> 00:57:53,124
There you go.
Whoa.

728
00:57:55,294 --> 00:57:56,660
Put your feet in.
Grab the reins.

729
00:58:04,870 --> 00:58:06,770
You ready?
Yeah.

730
00:58:06,772 --> 00:58:08,639
Pull back on those reins.

731
00:58:08,641 --> 00:58:09,773
Come on.

732
00:58:11,443 --> 00:58:13,911
Hey, there we go!

733
00:58:13,913 --> 00:58:17,414
Oh, whoa, we're going backwards!
This is awesome!

734
00:58:17,416 --> 00:58:18,750
Yeah, there you go, just like that.
Lay your hands down.

735
00:58:18,752 --> 00:58:19,718
Okay.

736
00:58:26,527 --> 00:58:28,393
How are you doing that?

737
00:58:28,395 --> 00:58:29,494
Why am I bouncing so much?

738
00:58:30,396 --> 00:58:32,230
Ease up on those
reins a little bit.

739
00:58:32,232 --> 00:58:33,497
All right.

740
00:58:46,746 --> 00:58:48,680
Atta girl!

741
00:58:48,682 --> 00:58:50,348
I don't think you
can keep up with me!

742
00:59:05,898 --> 00:59:07,332
You know,
I have to admit

743
00:59:07,334 --> 00:59:09,634
you're pretty good
on a horse.

744
00:59:09,636 --> 00:59:10,502
Well, thank you.

745
00:59:14,441 --> 00:59:16,442
But I don't know...

746
00:59:16,444 --> 00:59:18,678
I bet you couldn't beat
me to the barn.

747
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,413
Oh, I wouldn't go that way!
Whoa!

748
00:59:20,415 --> 00:59:21,247
Oh!

749
00:59:22,784 --> 00:59:23,849
Oh, my God!

750
00:59:25,986 --> 00:59:27,653
Oh, my God!

751
00:59:30,258 --> 00:59:32,325
Come here.

752
00:59:32,327 --> 00:59:33,559
I tried to tell you.

753
00:59:33,561 --> 00:59:34,827
I know you did.

754
00:59:37,598 --> 00:59:39,665
Well, this is, um...
This is home.

755
00:59:39,667 --> 00:59:41,801
Wow.
This is nice.

756
00:59:42,569 --> 00:59:44,570
Really nice.
Yeah.

757
00:59:44,572 --> 00:59:46,639
Oh, the shower's right in there,

758
00:59:46,641 --> 00:59:48,275
and there should be towels
and everything.

759
00:59:48,277 --> 00:59:49,009
Okay.

760
00:59:50,678 --> 00:59:52,312
Hey, uh, Sophia?

761
00:59:52,314 --> 00:59:54,281
Did you want soup?

762
00:59:54,949 --> 00:59:56,283
Oh, you make soup, too?

763
00:59:58,553 --> 01:00:00,454
Kind of.

764
01:00:00,456 --> 01:00:01,954
Soup, soup, soup...

765
01:00:16,537 --> 01:00:17,938
Oh, my God.

766
01:01:49,065 --> 01:01:50,099
Come on.

767
01:01:55,072 --> 01:01:56,406
There you go.

768
01:01:57,508 --> 01:01:58,407
Put your hands right here.

769
01:02:01,444 --> 01:02:03,078
The goal's pretty simple.

770
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:04,079
All you gotta do is hang
on for eight seconds.

771
01:02:14,425 --> 01:02:15,859
Wow!

772
01:02:15,861 --> 01:02:17,060
There's nothing to it.

773
01:02:18,662 --> 01:02:20,597
Yeah, some bulls
are nice like that.

774
01:02:21,966 --> 01:02:23,566
This is...
Yeah, okay.

775
01:02:23,568 --> 01:02:24,834
Excuse us, sorry.

776
01:02:25,469 --> 01:02:26,436
Sorry.

777
01:02:37,982 --> 01:02:39,682
So how do you know which
one you're gonna get?

778
01:02:39,684 --> 01:02:41,084
You don't.

779
01:02:41,086 --> 01:02:43,520
<i>You pick from a bowl.</i>

780
01:02:43,522 --> 01:02:46,991
<i>And the fan favorite from Walkertown,
North Carolina...</i>

781
01:02:46,993 --> 01:02:49,460
<i>Luke Collins!</i>

782
01:02:49,462 --> 01:02:52,463
<i>Number four is the chip
you selected...</i>

783
01:02:52,465 --> 01:02:53,697
<i>and that is Gunpowder
and Lead, Luke.</i>

784
01:02:54,966 --> 01:02:57,100
<i>Jared Middleton reaching in...</i>

785
01:02:57,102 --> 01:02:58,868
<i>and pulling out chip
number two.</i>

786
01:02:58,870 --> 01:03:00,603
<i>You have Asteroid.</i>

787
01:03:02,473 --> 01:03:03,840
Whoa... Whoa!

788
01:03:03,842 --> 01:03:06,076
That's impossible!
Yeah!

789
01:03:06,078 --> 01:03:07,812
You can only touch
with your riding hand.

790
01:03:07,814 --> 01:03:09,146
All other touching's
against the rules.

791
01:03:09,148 --> 01:03:11,816
Okay.
I got it.

792
01:03:20,826 --> 01:03:21,792
Let's go!

793
01:03:46,919 --> 01:03:48,920
If you are off balance even a little,
you lose points.

794
01:03:50,590 --> 01:03:52,791
<i>But if you control the bull,
you get style points.</i>

795
01:03:55,627 --> 01:03:56,927
Is that how you do
the hand? That?

796
01:03:57,629 --> 01:03:58,763
More or less.

797
01:04:07,974 --> 01:04:12,043
The bull is judged too,
on speed, agility and power.

798
01:04:12,045 --> 01:04:14,679
<i>Whether it bucks or blows out,
turns back around on you.</i>

799
01:04:28,594 --> 01:04:29,728
Yeah!

800
01:04:45,679 --> 01:04:46,679
Some bulls are just plain mean.

801
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:48,214
And others...

802
01:04:51,051 --> 01:04:52,553
<i>Others are monsters.</i>

803
01:04:56,189 --> 01:04:58,090
Let's brave the storm.

804
01:04:58,092 --> 01:04:59,158
Let's do it.

805
01:05:10,672 --> 01:05:12,906
This is certainly better
than the hospital, isn't it?

806
01:05:17,145 --> 01:05:18,145
How are you feeling?

807
01:05:19,781 --> 01:05:21,882
The better question is,
how do I look?

808
01:05:22,883 --> 01:05:24,617
Very handsome.

809
01:05:24,619 --> 01:05:26,319
All I care about.

810
01:05:27,788 --> 01:05:29,222
Hold on one second.

811
01:05:29,224 --> 01:05:30,724
Hello?

812
01:05:30,726 --> 01:05:31,892
<i>Hi, Sophia.
This is Adrienne.</i>

813
01:05:31,894 --> 01:05:33,794
Hi, Ms. Francis.

814
01:05:33,796 --> 01:05:35,762
<i>My client has an exhibit
in Charlotte next weekend.</i>

815
01:05:35,764 --> 01:05:37,064
<i>Can you be there?</i>

816
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:38,865
Yeah, I'd love to.
That sounds great.

817
01:05:38,867 --> 01:05:39,700
<i>This could be a real
opportunity for us.</i>

818
01:05:39,702 --> 01:05:40,934
Okay.

819
01:05:40,936 --> 01:05:42,169
<i>I'll email you
the details.</i>

820
01:05:42,171 --> 01:05:43,070
Okay. All right,
I'll talk to you soon.

821
01:05:43,072 --> 01:05:44,204
<i>Bye, Sophia.</i>

822
01:05:44,206 --> 01:05:45,138
Thanks, bye.

823
01:05:46,675 --> 01:05:47,642
Good news?

824
01:05:47,943 --> 01:05:49,010
Yeah.

825
01:05:49,012 --> 01:05:49,978
Um...

826
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,280
The woman I'm working for
this summer...

827
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:55,148
she has a client with an
art exhibit in Charlotte...

828
01:05:55,150 --> 01:05:56,984
and wants me to help her out.

829
01:05:56,986 --> 01:05:58,952
I didn't know you had
an interest in art.

830
01:05:58,954 --> 01:06:01,655
Only since I was, like, five.

831
01:06:01,657 --> 01:06:04,692
Ruth also loved art.
Yeah.

832
01:06:04,694 --> 01:06:08,229
Yeah, I remember the story with
the painting in the hotel lobby.

833
01:06:08,231 --> 01:06:10,932
You've heard of Black
Mountain College?

834
01:06:13,202 --> 01:06:15,637
I'm doing my senior
thesis on it right now.

835
01:06:15,639 --> 01:06:17,839
That's where I was headed...

836
01:06:17,841 --> 01:06:19,340
when I got in that fight
with the guardrail.

837
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:25,113
Are you sure this is how you
want to spend your honeymoon?

838
01:06:25,115 --> 01:06:26,214
Oh, I promise you're going
to love it, I promise!

839
01:06:28,151 --> 01:06:30,184
I'd rather we'd just
stayed in bed.

840
01:06:49,673 --> 01:06:52,674
<i>You weren't able to engage your
passion for contemporary art...</i>

841
01:06:52,676 --> 01:06:53,741
<i>in our little town...</i>

842
01:06:56,412 --> 01:06:58,147
<i>so Black Mountain College
was a godsend.</i>

843
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:04,753
It's so amazing!

844
01:07:09,292 --> 01:07:12,695
Really look at your work
to understand it.

845
01:07:12,697 --> 01:07:15,230
But I want to be able to
control the accidents...

846
01:07:15,232 --> 01:07:17,767
and not leave them to fate...

847
01:07:17,769 --> 01:07:19,135
or the Lord or chance,
whatever you want to call it.

848
01:07:20,937 --> 01:07:22,871
I teach you to see.

849
01:07:22,873 --> 01:07:25,040
Then even an accident
will have purpose...

850
01:07:26,376 --> 01:07:27,976
and direction.

851
01:07:33,851 --> 01:07:36,386
Oh, I love it!

852
01:07:36,388 --> 01:07:38,488
For over 500 years, artists have
been reproducing...

853
01:07:38,490 --> 01:07:40,890
quite literally what they
see in front of them.

854
01:07:40,892 --> 01:07:43,126
Then Kandinsky came and broke
all the rules, all of them!

855
01:07:45,062 --> 01:07:47,097
Sorry.

856
01:07:47,099 --> 01:07:48,865
I love it!

857
01:07:57,441 --> 01:07:59,809
I can't believe we met
Josef Albers today.

858
01:08:05,950 --> 01:08:07,484
It's just a bit further.

859
01:08:10,990 --> 01:08:12,857
You all right?

860
01:08:12,859 --> 01:08:14,158
Oh!

861
01:08:18,163 --> 01:08:19,195
You ready?

862
01:08:19,363 --> 01:08:20,363
Yeah.

863
01:08:24,902 --> 01:08:26,202
You like it?

864
01:08:27,874 --> 01:08:29,507
<i>From one happy day
to the next...</i>

865
01:08:29,509 --> 01:08:34,378
<i>we began the process
of creating a life together.</i>

866
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:35,446
Doesn't look like
anyone's home.

867
01:08:35,448 --> 01:08:37,448
No, I don't think
you should go in.

868
01:08:37,450 --> 01:08:39,183
Ira!
What?

869
01:08:39,185 --> 01:08:40,918
Well, let's just use the key.

870
01:08:42,088 --> 01:08:44,121
No!
Oh, my God!

871
01:08:45,858 --> 01:08:47,392
You wonderful person!

872
01:08:47,394 --> 01:08:48,793
Wait, wait, wait.
Come here.

873
01:08:52,230 --> 01:08:53,230
Yeah, there.

874
01:08:56,568 --> 01:08:57,501
No.

875
01:08:58,370 --> 01:08:59,336
There.

876
01:09:04,343 --> 01:09:07,212
There! First thing you see
when you come in!

877
01:09:07,214 --> 01:09:09,447
<i>Life was busy
and happy for us.</i>

878
01:09:09,449 --> 01:09:12,818
<i>I took over my dad's
booming business...</i>

879
01:09:12,820 --> 01:09:15,921
<i>and you found a job
teaching at the local school.</i>

880
01:09:15,923 --> 01:09:17,454
Who understands this, huh?

881
01:09:17,456 --> 01:09:19,156
Oh! Look at this!

882
01:09:19,158 --> 01:09:21,960
You're all on your way to
becoming math geniuses.

883
01:09:21,962 --> 01:09:24,062
Solve the problems
on the board.

884
01:09:24,064 --> 01:09:26,932
If you have any questions,
please ask.

885
01:09:26,934 --> 01:09:28,967
Wow, it sounds like you
made her very happy.

886
01:09:30,169 --> 01:09:31,403
I did.

887
01:09:32,505 --> 01:09:34,272
For a while.

888
01:09:36,943 --> 01:09:38,945
His first cowboy hat.

889
01:09:38,947 --> 01:09:40,313
That is so cute!

890
01:09:40,315 --> 01:09:41,180
Never took it off.

891
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:43,115
He ate in it.

892
01:09:43,117 --> 01:09:45,051
He slept in it.

893
01:09:45,053 --> 01:09:46,618
He even tried to glue it to his
head so it wouldn't come off!

894
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:48,086
Mom!

895
01:09:48,088 --> 01:09:49,020
What?

896
01:09:51,090 --> 01:09:53,992
He broke his arm riding a calf
when he was seven.

897
01:09:53,994 --> 01:09:56,595
I found him sneaking into the
barn at night to practice...

898
01:09:56,597 --> 01:09:59,498
hanging on with his
non-cast arm.

899
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:00,900
Even then, I couldn't get him to
stop riding when he shouldn't.

900
01:10:04,872 --> 01:10:06,405
Hey. There you go.

901
01:10:06,407 --> 01:10:08,207
Thank you.

902
01:10:08,209 --> 01:10:09,308
Sweet.

903
01:10:14,114 --> 01:10:16,382
That's Luke's dad, Jack.

904
01:10:16,384 --> 01:10:17,583
He was a great man.
Mmm-hmm.

905
01:10:17,585 --> 01:10:19,218
Great rider, too.

906
01:10:21,321 --> 01:10:23,890
Even if you stop now, you'd still
have a better career than he had.

907
01:10:27,194 --> 01:10:28,194
What happened?

908
01:10:29,096 --> 01:10:31,097
He died of a heart attack.

909
01:10:31,099 --> 01:10:32,466
Yeah, almost five years
ago now.

910
01:10:35,904 --> 01:10:38,438
How about a little dessert?

911
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:41,208
Luke, wait till you see
what I made for you.

912
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:43,343
Sophia, it's worth the calories.

913
01:10:47,281 --> 01:10:48,214
No.

914
01:10:55,123 --> 01:10:56,690
How come your mom keeps talking
about you giving up riding?

915
01:10:59,027 --> 01:11:01,395
She's just being an
overprotective mom.

916
01:11:03,231 --> 01:11:04,998
How bad did you get hurt?

917
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,433
Sophia...
No.

918
01:11:06,435 --> 01:11:08,201
I know all riders are
bound to get hurt.

919
01:11:08,203 --> 01:11:10,104
It's not a matter of
"if" but "when. "

920
01:11:10,106 --> 01:11:11,639
That's right.

921
01:11:11,641 --> 01:11:13,474
They say all bull riders are
either stupid or crazy.

922
01:11:13,476 --> 01:11:15,175
Yeah, and which one are you?

923
01:11:18,179 --> 01:11:20,414
I don't know.
I guess a little of both.

924
01:11:21,282 --> 01:11:23,350
What are you doing?

925
01:11:23,352 --> 01:11:27,388
This is a new painting by an artist
that Adrienne Francis represents.

926
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:29,390
You know, the woman
I'm interning for?

927
01:11:29,392 --> 01:11:31,025
$80 grand, really?

928
01:11:32,261 --> 01:11:33,261
A lot of people
think he's a genius.

929
01:11:34,229 --> 01:11:36,297
Yeah,
he most certainly is...

930
01:11:36,299 --> 01:11:39,000
getting people to fork over
$80 grand for that.

931
01:11:43,072 --> 01:11:46,374
Are you sure that you wanna go to
this gallery showing in Charlotte?

932
01:11:46,376 --> 01:11:47,709
You want me to, right?

933
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:48,609
Of course.

934
01:11:49,278 --> 01:11:51,112
Then I'll be there.

935
01:11:51,114 --> 01:11:52,747
Yeah, but you're riding
that afternoon.

936
01:11:52,749 --> 01:11:54,315
I'll be there.

937
01:12:09,132 --> 01:12:11,367
Wow!
Don't you look nice!

938
01:12:12,535 --> 01:12:15,169
Never seen you in a
coat and tie before.

939
01:12:15,171 --> 01:12:17,305
Yeah, doesn't happen too often.

940
01:12:18,707 --> 01:12:21,577
Oh, that's my boss,
Adrienne Francis.

941
01:12:21,579 --> 01:12:22,678
I gotta go.
Okay?

942
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:24,446
Yeah.
Go.

943
01:12:26,416 --> 01:12:29,418
Hi. Sophia.
Nice to meet you.

944
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:31,053
Hopefully, Sophia will be joining
me in New York, and my team.

945
01:12:35,325 --> 01:12:38,228
You usually find these sort of things
in process art or lenticular prints...

946
01:12:38,230 --> 01:12:41,331
but it's very rare in brushwork.

947
01:12:41,333 --> 01:12:43,699
That is what makes
this piece so special.

948
01:13:06,123 --> 01:13:07,657
If you have any questions,
let me know. Thank you.

949
01:13:09,693 --> 01:13:11,194
Excuse me.

950
01:13:11,196 --> 01:13:12,127
Just one second.

951
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:18,101
It'll be worth twice that
a year from now.

952
01:13:18,103 --> 01:13:20,303
At $20,000, it's a steal.

953
01:13:20,305 --> 01:13:21,805
- Sure.
- Good.

954
01:13:21,807 --> 01:13:23,173
Do you wanna get it?

955
01:13:23,175 --> 01:13:24,407
Let's do it.
Okay.

956
01:13:33,385 --> 01:13:35,553
I'll fly you to New York.
See the space, meet the team.

957
01:13:35,555 --> 01:13:37,088
Yes!

958
01:13:37,090 --> 01:13:38,589
These are some
very important people.

959
01:13:38,591 --> 01:13:41,191
So if you can't do it, don't say yes.
No...

960
01:13:41,193 --> 01:13:43,093
I know you have finals
and other commitments.

961
01:13:43,095 --> 01:13:45,595
I'd love to. This is the most
important thing to me.

962
01:13:46,564 --> 01:13:48,131
Oh!
Uh, Luke, hi.

963
01:13:48,133 --> 01:13:50,401
This is Adrienne Francis.

964
01:13:50,403 --> 01:13:52,570
Adrienne, this is
my boyfriend, Luke.

965
01:13:54,473 --> 01:13:56,440
Are you in college with Sophia?

966
01:13:56,442 --> 01:13:58,175
No, never made it to college.

967
01:13:58,177 --> 01:14:02,113
I've never met a professional
bull rider before.

968
01:14:02,115 --> 01:14:03,547
Probably not too many
in Manhattan.

969
01:14:05,217 --> 01:14:07,652
Are you an art lover,
like Sophia?

970
01:14:07,654 --> 01:14:09,187
No, I can't say that I am.

971
01:14:10,856 --> 01:14:12,223
What did you think of tonight?

972
01:14:13,325 --> 01:14:14,291
Honestly?

973
01:14:15,260 --> 01:14:16,360
Of course.

974
01:14:18,697 --> 01:14:20,231
I think there's more bullshit
here than where I work.

975
01:14:33,379 --> 01:14:35,347
I like him.
Keep this one.

976
01:14:42,254 --> 01:14:43,722
How could you say that to her?

977
01:14:44,657 --> 01:14:46,491
It was a joke.

978
01:14:46,493 --> 01:14:48,894
To the woman who's
gonna be my boss?

979
01:14:48,896 --> 01:14:50,896
To the woman who I hope
is gonna launch my career?

980
01:14:50,898 --> 01:14:53,431
That lady? Come on.
No, you come on.

981
01:14:53,433 --> 01:14:56,501
You know how hard I have just
tried to fit into your world.

982
01:14:56,503 --> 01:14:57,636
Why can't you try to
fit into mine?

983
01:14:57,638 --> 01:14:58,770
I do!

984
01:15:00,773 --> 01:15:02,942
It was a joke, okay?
She thought it was funny.

985
01:15:02,944 --> 01:15:04,744
She laughed.
You don't know that.

986
01:15:04,746 --> 01:15:06,212
What if she was just trying
to be polite?

987
01:15:07,347 --> 01:15:08,481
Does this make sense?

988
01:15:09,215 --> 01:15:10,649
What?

989
01:15:10,651 --> 01:15:12,751
How are we gonna
make this work, huh?

990
01:15:12,753 --> 01:15:14,553
Do you really see yourself
living on a ranch?

991
01:15:14,555 --> 01:15:15,754
Working a ranch
the rest of your life?

992
01:15:17,323 --> 01:15:18,823
And what am I gonna do?

993
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:22,328
Move to Manhattan?

994
01:15:22,330 --> 01:15:24,197
Go out with your artist friends?
Go to brunch?

995
01:15:24,199 --> 01:15:25,765
Talk about squiggly lines
on a white canvas...

996
01:15:25,767 --> 01:15:27,300
like they're more than squiggly
lines on a white canvas?

997
01:15:27,302 --> 01:15:29,769
I know all of that, I do.
I get it.

998
01:15:43,617 --> 01:15:44,517
I just...

999
01:15:46,887 --> 01:15:48,688
I just don't know how
to make this work.

1000
01:15:49,356 --> 01:15:50,957
I don't know either.

1001
01:15:52,259 --> 01:15:53,926
But I know that I want to.

1002
01:16:15,950 --> 01:16:17,818
Are we just crazy?

1003
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:21,588
Do you think it could
work between us?

1004
01:16:22,790 --> 01:16:25,559
We just come from
such different worlds.

1005
01:16:27,328 --> 01:16:30,831
But I've never felt this way
about anybody before.

1006
01:16:32,001 --> 01:16:33,434
Not everybody gets that.

1007
01:16:34,703 --> 01:16:35,903
You did.

1008
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:40,307
It wasn't that simple.

1009
01:16:45,647 --> 01:16:47,514
<i>As the years went by...</i>

1010
01:16:47,516 --> 01:16:50,451
<i>I could see how much
she wanted to start a family.</i>

1011
01:16:51,954 --> 01:16:54,389
<i>We tried to adopt.</i>

1012
01:16:54,391 --> 01:16:56,457
<i>But it wasn't so easy
back then.</i>

1013
01:17:21,917 --> 01:17:24,052
Now, today we're
going to learn...

1014
01:17:25,622 --> 01:17:26,689
about my favorite...

1015
01:17:27,857 --> 01:17:29,925
book.

1016
01:17:29,927 --> 01:17:31,760
<i>It's called Pippi Longstocking.</i>

1017
01:17:53,417 --> 01:17:55,351
If anyone teases him about this,

1018
01:17:55,353 --> 01:17:56,785
they'll have me to deal with.

1019
01:18:13,069 --> 01:18:14,670
Good morning.

1020
01:18:20,511 --> 01:18:22,479
Hello.

1021
01:18:22,481 --> 01:18:25,081
My name is Ruth Levinson.
I'm Daniel's teacher.

1022
01:18:27,385 --> 01:18:29,886
I came here because
I'm slightly concerned.

1023
01:18:29,888 --> 01:18:31,521
He's falling asleep in class.

1024
01:18:31,523 --> 01:18:33,722
<i>We were surprised to learn...</i>

1025
01:18:33,724 --> 01:18:37,994
<i>that Daniel McDonald was being
raised by a half-brother and his wife.</i>

1026
01:18:37,996 --> 01:18:40,130
<i>Neither seemed to care
if he ate or starved.</i>

1027
01:18:40,132 --> 01:18:43,466
He's a very bright boy.

1028
01:18:43,468 --> 01:18:45,001
Infinite potential.

1029
01:18:45,003 --> 01:18:47,937
Maybe I could tutor
him after class?

1030
01:18:47,939 --> 01:18:48,838
All right.

1031
01:18:49,740 --> 01:18:50,840
Yes?

1032
01:19:37,377 --> 01:19:38,833
Are you a wolf?

1033
01:19:39,571 --> 01:19:41,138
No, ma'am.

1034
01:19:43,587 --> 01:19:45,230
Are you a bear?

1035
01:19:45,403 --> 01:19:47,653
- No, ma'am.
- Oh.

1036
01:19:47,688 --> 01:19:49,534
Are you a boy?

1037
01:19:49,936 --> 01:19:51,102
Yes, ma'am.

1038
01:19:52,038 --> 01:19:54,806
Boys use knives and forks.

1039
01:20:05,684 --> 01:20:06,818
Oh. Almost.

1040
01:20:07,553 --> 01:20:10,155
Yeah.
Okay.

1041
01:20:10,157 --> 01:20:13,158
What star is that?

1042
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:15,126
The North Star, Polaris.

1043
01:20:15,128 --> 01:20:16,761
Good. Look.

1044
01:20:20,766 --> 01:20:22,100
"That was because
she didn't want to

1045
01:20:22,102 --> 01:20:23,970
"turn around to get home.

1046
01:20:23,972 --> 01:20:27,006
"When she reached Tommy's and
Annika's gate, she stopped.

1047
01:20:32,144 --> 01:20:35,046
<i>Pretty soon,
the tutoring was every day.</i>

1048
01:20:35,048 --> 01:20:36,014
<i>And sometimes he
stayed for dinner.</i>

1049
01:20:49,830 --> 01:20:52,532
<i>We never said he was the child
we could never have...</i>

1050
01:20:53,033 --> 01:20:54,901
<i>but even so...</i>

1051
01:21:04,978 --> 01:21:07,013
What do you think?

1052
01:21:07,015 --> 01:21:09,815
She's making her son dinner.
Right?

1053
01:21:10,684 --> 01:21:11,584
Yeah.

1054
01:21:17,625 --> 01:21:20,594
I hate taking him back there.
Why can't we adopt him?

1055
01:21:20,596 --> 01:21:21,328
Because they're his
legal guardians.

1056
01:21:21,330 --> 01:21:22,663
There's nothing we can do.

1057
01:21:22,665 --> 01:21:23,797
Did you speak to the lawyer?

1058
01:21:23,799 --> 01:21:25,933
I did, and that's what he said.

1059
01:21:25,935 --> 01:21:28,802
They don't care about him.
They don't!

1060
01:21:28,804 --> 01:21:30,169
They're his next of kin
and they're proud people.

1061
01:21:30,171 --> 01:21:31,737
They're not gonna let us
take Daniel away.

1062
01:21:31,739 --> 01:21:33,205
There must be something
more we can do.

1063
01:21:41,816 --> 01:21:42,716
Ruth?

1064
01:21:44,052 --> 01:21:45,018
We better go.

1065
01:22:29,698 --> 01:22:31,099
You be good.
Okay, pal?

1066
01:22:31,101 --> 01:22:32,133
Okay.

1067
01:22:34,136 --> 01:22:36,337
Maybe I'll raise chickens...

1068
01:22:36,339 --> 01:22:38,139
or work at the factory.

1069
01:22:38,141 --> 01:22:40,174
If that's what you want.

1070
01:22:40,176 --> 01:22:43,111
You can be anything you want,
Daniel McDonald.

1071
01:22:43,113 --> 01:22:46,080
Anything at all.
A farmer, a lawyer, an astronomer.

1072
01:22:48,985 --> 01:22:49,952
You're a very clever boy.

1073
01:22:51,054 --> 01:22:52,655
You really think so?
Yeah!

1074
01:22:53,023 --> 01:22:54,223
I know so.

1075
01:22:56,693 --> 01:22:57,892
All right, come on.

1076
01:23:04,433 --> 01:23:06,035
Okay.

1077
01:23:06,037 --> 01:23:06,969
I'm just saying goodbye.

1078
01:23:08,104 --> 01:23:09,338
You can't stop me!

1079
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:11,874
I'm just saying goodbye!

1080
01:23:11,876 --> 01:23:14,243
I know you are, sweetheart.
Let's go back to the car.

1081
01:23:14,245 --> 01:23:16,178
There's nothing we can do.
There's nothing we can do.

1082
01:23:16,180 --> 01:23:18,180
Please reconsider.
Please reconsider!

1083
01:23:18,182 --> 01:23:19,448
There's nothing we can do.

1084
01:23:19,450 --> 01:23:20,449
He deserves better than this.

1085
01:23:21,685 --> 01:23:23,253
Sweetheart, get in the car.

1086
01:23:23,255 --> 01:23:24,988
They don't care about him.
I know they don't.

1087
01:23:24,990 --> 01:23:26,455
They don't care about him!

1088
01:23:37,367 --> 01:23:38,367
Ruth.

1089
01:23:41,272 --> 01:23:42,205
Ruth.

1090
01:23:47,478 --> 01:23:48,411
What was I supposed to do?

1091
01:23:54,118 --> 01:23:56,051
Fight for custody.

1092
01:23:56,053 --> 01:23:58,353
From a half-brother in
small-town North Carolina?

1093
01:23:59,423 --> 01:24:02,025
Come on. We wouldn't have
had a chance!

1094
01:24:02,027 --> 01:24:03,793
And who knows what they
would've done to Daniel.

1095
01:24:06,130 --> 01:24:07,797
We were a family.

1096
01:24:13,404 --> 01:24:15,305
We are a family.

1097
01:24:20,011 --> 01:24:22,179
Ruth, you are my family.

1098
01:24:38,897 --> 01:24:41,332
I wanted kids too, you know.

1099
01:24:52,043 --> 01:24:54,311
We never saw Daniel again.

1100
01:24:57,983 --> 01:24:59,316
Oh, my God.

1101
01:25:54,407 --> 01:25:55,340
Oh, shit.

1102
01:26:04,116 --> 01:26:06,953
<i>Luke Collins is trying
to come around.</i>

1103
01:26:06,955 --> 01:26:11,057
<i>The bull fighter's taking the bull
away in the other direction.</i>

1104
01:26:11,059 --> 01:26:14,126
<i>I think he's gonna be okay.
He's trying to get up. He is!</i>

1105
01:26:14,128 --> 01:26:16,429
<i>Let me get him something to
make him feel a little bit better.</i>

1106
01:26:16,431 --> 01:26:19,332
<i>92 points!</i>

1107
01:26:19,334 --> 01:26:21,167
<i>264 on three bulls!</i>

1108
01:26:21,169 --> 01:26:22,635
<i>Luke Collins is your
clear-cut winner.</i>

1109
01:26:27,507 --> 01:26:29,041
He's awesome.

1110
01:26:29,043 --> 01:26:31,577
<i>...number nine spot
in the world.</i>

1111
01:26:37,251 --> 01:26:38,351
Are you okay, Luke?

1112
01:26:40,655 --> 01:26:42,389
I'm fine.

1113
01:26:45,093 --> 01:26:46,426
All right.

1114
01:26:46,428 --> 01:26:49,496
Have an amazing time in New York.
Yes, I will.

1115
01:26:49,498 --> 01:26:50,664
You impressed Adrienne,
you'll impress her team.

1116
01:26:50,666 --> 01:26:52,231
Okay.
Gotta go.

1117
01:26:52,233 --> 01:26:53,566
This is what you've always wanted!
I know!

1118
01:26:53,568 --> 01:26:55,368
Bye! See you on Monday.

1119
01:26:58,206 --> 01:26:59,907
Hey, babe.
I'm walking to the taxi right now.

1120
01:26:59,909 --> 01:27:02,109
<i>Sophia, it's Luiz.</i>

1121
01:27:02,111 --> 01:27:03,310
<i>Hi, Luiz.
Something's happened to Luke.</i>

1122
01:27:09,083 --> 01:27:10,450
Hi, can I help you?

1123
01:27:10,452 --> 01:27:13,020
Um, I need to see
my boyfriend, Luke Collins.

1124
01:27:13,022 --> 01:27:15,122
He came in an ambulance earlier.
I need to see him.

1125
01:27:15,124 --> 01:27:17,025
I'm sorry.
Only family can visit.

1126
01:27:18,460 --> 01:27:20,028
Okay.
Can I at least know how he is?

1127
01:27:21,396 --> 01:27:24,464
His condition is stable,
but he's getting an MRI.

1128
01:27:24,466 --> 01:27:26,199
He took a pretty hard fall.

1129
01:27:26,201 --> 01:27:29,002
If you wanna take a seat,
I'll check with the doctor.

1130
01:27:29,004 --> 01:27:30,270
I'll let you know.

1131
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:33,173
Thank you.

1132
01:27:39,248 --> 01:27:40,381
So, are you light-headed, dizzy?

1133
01:27:41,350 --> 01:27:42,684
Nausea?

1134
01:27:48,123 --> 01:27:50,590
I'd like you to stay overnight
for observation.

1135
01:27:52,628 --> 01:27:53,995
Sweetie. What are you
doing here?

1136
01:27:54,530 --> 01:27:57,031
I came as soon as I heard.

1137
01:27:58,334 --> 01:27:59,067
Aren't you supposed to
be in New York?

1138
01:27:59,401 --> 01:28:00,668
No, no.

1139
01:28:01,337 --> 01:28:02,303
I should be here.

1140
01:28:05,007 --> 01:28:06,441
Thank God you're okay.

1141
01:28:06,443 --> 01:28:08,109
I'm fine.

1142
01:28:08,111 --> 01:28:09,477
You're lucky to be alive,
is what you are.

1143
01:28:10,447 --> 01:28:12,114
What?

1144
01:28:12,116 --> 01:28:13,449
I just got a little dizzy,
that's all.

1145
01:28:13,451 --> 01:28:15,351
Luke,

1146
01:28:15,353 --> 01:28:17,052
you need to stop downplaying
the severity of your condition.

1147
01:28:18,989 --> 01:28:21,592
If you care about your friend,
you need to make him understand...

1148
01:28:21,875 --> 01:28:24,537
that his riding days are over.

1149
01:28:29,566 --> 01:28:31,667
What is he talking about?

1150
01:28:35,672 --> 01:28:37,639
I'm tired, okay?

1151
01:28:37,641 --> 01:28:39,475
Can we just talk
about it tomorrow?

1152
01:28:41,511 --> 01:28:44,179
Ms. Francis, I am so sorry
about all of this.

1153
01:28:44,181 --> 01:28:48,784
<i>I understand you can't meet the team
this weekend, given the circumstances.</i>

1154
01:28:48,786 --> 01:28:50,486
<i>And I do hope
Luke is okay.</i>

1155
01:28:50,488 --> 01:28:52,321
Yeah, me, too.

1156
01:28:56,493 --> 01:28:58,794
I don't know when I'm gonna
be able to come to New York.

1157
01:28:58,796 --> 01:29:01,663
<i>Oh, really?</i>

1158
01:29:01,665 --> 01:29:04,100
<i>Wait a minute. You're not
rethinking the internship, are you?</i>

1159
01:29:05,636 --> 01:29:07,604
<i>Look, Sophia.</i>

1160
01:29:07,606 --> 01:29:12,308
<i>but you're going to have to figure out
for yourself what that's going to be.</i>

1161
01:29:12,310 --> 01:29:13,743
I know.

1162
01:29:28,359 --> 01:29:30,827
<i>World Finals qualifier from Walkertown,
North Carolina...</i>

1163
01:29:30,829 --> 01:29:33,096
<i>Luke Collins!</i>

1164
01:29:33,098 --> 01:29:35,498
<i>And he is ready
to rock and roll!</i>

1165
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:37,333
Let's go!

1166
01:29:37,335 --> 01:29:40,371
<i>Luke Collins outside in the middle,
rocked over!</i>

1167
01:29:40,373 --> 01:29:42,306
<i>He is just...
Wow!</i>

1168
01:29:50,282 --> 01:29:53,283
<i>A double flip somersault
face-plant into the dirt.</i>

1169
01:29:56,896 --> 01:29:58,647
<i>You've gotta get him
out of there!</i>

1170
01:30:01,126 --> 01:30:02,493
<i>Yeah,
no doubt about it.</i>

1171
01:30:02,495 --> 01:30:04,862
<i>He took a devastating shot
right there...</i>

1172
01:30:04,864 --> 01:30:08,532
<i>by one of the PBR's best.</i>

1173
01:30:08,534 --> 01:30:11,202
<i>Our sports medicine team
are coming in right now...</i>

1174
01:30:11,204 --> 01:30:14,105
<i>to take care of the young man
from North Carolina.</i>

1175
01:30:14,107 --> 01:30:15,874
<i>Talk about your
scary moments.</i>

1176
01:30:15,876 --> 01:30:19,343
<i>The degree of difficulty here
is impossible to calculate.</i>

1177
01:30:19,345 --> 01:30:22,446
<i>The official buck-off time,
4.7 seconds.</i>

1178
01:30:22,448 --> 01:30:24,281
<i>Right now, our medical
staff is attending.</i>

1179
01:30:33,693 --> 01:30:36,294
That's fine, right here.

1180
01:30:36,296 --> 01:30:37,863
No. It's fine, please.
Thanks.

1181
01:30:39,499 --> 01:30:40,432
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1182
01:30:41,801 --> 01:30:43,168
I'll take the bag.

1183
01:30:43,170 --> 01:30:44,369
No, I got it.

1184
01:31:12,432 --> 01:31:13,366
Thank you.

1185
01:31:14,568 --> 01:31:15,901
Luke...

1186
01:31:18,938 --> 01:31:21,907
I'm really sorry.

1187
01:31:21,909 --> 01:31:25,744
I know how hard it must be to give
up that whole part of your life.

1188
01:31:30,784 --> 01:31:31,918
You're kidding, right?

1189
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:33,319
Sophia...

1190
01:31:33,321 --> 01:31:35,421
You heard the doctors.

1191
01:31:35,423 --> 01:31:36,589
Doctors don't know everything.

1192
01:31:36,591 --> 01:31:38,257
Are you crazy?

1193
01:31:38,259 --> 01:31:39,659
I watched what happened
to you on YouTube.

1194
01:31:39,661 --> 01:31:41,761
You were in a coma
for 10 days.

1195
01:31:41,763 --> 01:31:44,563
I told you, every time a rider
gets in that chute, he could die.

1196
01:31:44,565 --> 01:31:46,532
That's bullshit!
Your situation is different!

1197
01:31:51,538 --> 01:31:53,506
You have to quit!

1198
01:31:53,508 --> 01:31:56,209
You have to!
I can't!

1199
01:31:56,211 --> 01:31:58,511
I can't be with someone if every
time they walk out the door...

1200
01:31:58,513 --> 01:31:59,679
I don't know if I'm gonna
see them again!

1201
01:31:59,681 --> 01:32:01,247
Then that's your choice.

1202
01:32:01,249 --> 01:32:02,615
Yeah, I chose you!
I chose you over New York!

1203
01:32:05,753 --> 01:32:08,422
Over my internship.
I chose you over everything.

1204
01:32:08,424 --> 01:32:09,723
I didn't ask you
to change your life.

1205
01:32:09,725 --> 01:32:11,358
You can't expect me
to change mine.

1206
01:32:15,329 --> 01:32:16,963
This is what I do.

1207
01:32:18,966 --> 01:32:20,834
It's all I know.

1208
01:32:24,372 --> 01:32:26,373
This is my life.

1209
01:32:26,375 --> 01:32:28,508
I thought this was our life.

1210
01:32:30,511 --> 01:32:32,279
I can't watch you ruin it.

1211
01:32:53,434 --> 01:32:54,668
Hi.

1212
01:32:54,670 --> 01:32:56,571
Right upstairs.
Thanks.

1213
01:33:02,544 --> 01:33:03,678
How was...

1214
01:33:06,682 --> 01:33:08,416
How was New York?

1215
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:12,586
I never made it.

1216
01:33:14,423 --> 01:33:16,557
And I broke up
with Luke anyway.

1217
01:33:18,060 --> 01:33:20,595
I'm really sorry.
Come here.

1218
01:33:20,597 --> 01:33:21,729
Come here.

1219
01:33:30,005 --> 01:33:31,739
How can I help?

1220
01:33:36,780 --> 01:33:38,747
Take my mind off of it.

1221
01:33:41,650 --> 01:33:44,419
What happened after
that fight over Daniel?

1222
01:33:44,421 --> 01:33:46,654
Are you sure you don't wanna
talk about you and Luke?

1223
01:33:46,822 --> 01:33:47,822
Mmm.

1224
01:33:49,024 --> 01:33:50,726
Yeah, I'm sure.

1225
01:33:54,431 --> 01:33:55,931
It's a scary thing.

1226
01:33:57,767 --> 01:34:00,369
How the people
you're closest to...

1227
01:34:01,071 --> 01:34:03,339
can so quickly become...

1228
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:05,641
strangers.

1229
01:34:33,404 --> 01:34:36,005
I can't do this anymore.

1230
01:34:39,777 --> 01:34:42,077
I'm going crazy.

1231
01:34:46,784 --> 01:34:48,918
I know it's not your fault.

1232
01:34:51,756 --> 01:34:53,156
I have to go.

1233
01:35:38,070 --> 01:35:39,670
No, please don't!
I just need to say something.

1234
01:35:40,705 --> 01:35:41,872
I need to say something.

1235
01:35:48,079 --> 01:35:51,148
I fell in love with you the
first time I saw you.

1236
01:35:51,150 --> 01:35:52,917
You're just the most amazing,
beautiful girl I ever met...

1237
01:35:52,919 --> 01:35:54,585
and somehow...

1238
01:35:54,587 --> 01:35:56,721
I don't know,
somehow you chose me.

1239
01:36:00,026 --> 01:36:02,694
But how I loved you then...

1240
01:36:02,696 --> 01:36:04,596
it's nothing compared to
how I love you now.

1241
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:09,834
Now, I love you with
everything inside of me.

1242
01:36:10,769 --> 01:36:12,169
I think you should go.

1243
01:36:17,743 --> 01:36:19,144
I love you so much,
I just want you to be happy.

1244
01:36:21,647 --> 01:36:23,882
Even if that happiness
no longer includes me.

1245
01:37:04,858 --> 01:37:07,560
Love requires sacrifice.

1246
01:37:11,131 --> 01:37:12,565
Always.

1247
01:38:18,132 --> 01:38:19,133
<i>And from that day on,
Sophia,</i>

1248
01:38:19,135 --> 01:38:23,805
<i>it wasn't exactly happily ever after,
but it was pretty close.</i>

1249
01:38:26,241 --> 01:38:30,044
<i>We focused on celebrating all
the wonderful things we had...</i>

1250
01:38:30,046 --> 01:38:31,980
<i>rather than regretting
the things we didn't.</i>

1251
01:38:34,216 --> 01:38:35,782
<i>Every anniversary, we would
drive to Black Mountain.</i>

1252
01:38:37,319 --> 01:38:40,254
<i>I still wrote Ruth letters...</i>

1253
01:38:40,256 --> 01:38:41,990
<i>even though I saw her
every day.</i>

1254
01:38:51,634 --> 01:38:52,900
Ruthie.

1255
01:38:57,173 --> 01:38:58,140
Ruth.

1256
01:39:25,168 --> 01:39:27,870
<i>So many wonderful years.</i>

1257
01:39:29,072 --> 01:39:31,141
<i>But, of course,
not nearly enough.</i>

1258
01:39:45,689 --> 01:39:48,357
<i>The paintings Ruth
and I had collected...</i>

1259
01:39:48,359 --> 01:39:51,695
<i>only served as a reminder
of what I had lost.</i>

1260
01:39:53,297 --> 01:39:55,932
<i>So I packed them away.</i>

1261
01:39:58,035 --> 01:39:59,869
Can I help you?

1262
01:39:59,871 --> 01:40:00,937
My name is Andrea McDonald.

1263
01:40:01,972 --> 01:40:03,706
I believe you knew
my husband...

1264
01:40:04,808 --> 01:40:06,308
Daniel McDonald?

1265
01:40:11,048 --> 01:40:14,017
He collapsed in his classroom
early one morning before school.

1266
01:40:14,019 --> 01:40:16,453
A brain aneurysm.

1267
01:40:16,455 --> 01:40:18,788
That was six years ago.

1268
01:40:20,891 --> 01:40:23,093
I'm very sorry to hear that.

1269
01:40:23,095 --> 01:40:24,260
Thank you.

1270
01:40:26,031 --> 01:40:27,998
He was a teacher?

1271
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:31,235
A professor.

1272
01:40:31,237 --> 01:40:33,303
Physics and astronomy at the
University College London.

1273
01:40:33,938 --> 01:40:35,972
Astronomy.

1274
01:40:35,974 --> 01:40:38,475
I moved back to the States
a few years ago.

1275
01:40:40,277 --> 01:40:42,212
When I saw your wife's
obituary in the paper...

1276
01:40:42,214 --> 01:40:43,214
I knew I had to bring you this.

1277
01:40:49,521 --> 01:40:51,088
It meant a lot to him.

1278
01:41:48,948 --> 01:41:51,316
You did everything you could
with Luke, Sophia.

1279
01:41:52,485 --> 01:41:54,120
You sacrificed.

1280
01:41:56,390 --> 01:41:58,224
I have loved spending
time with you.

1281
01:42:00,293 --> 01:42:02,060
You've made me very happy.

1282
01:42:25,385 --> 01:42:27,220
What are you doing up so late?

1283
01:42:28,955 --> 01:42:30,356
I won tonight.

1284
01:42:31,258 --> 01:42:32,625
Puts me fifth in the world.

1285
01:42:37,497 --> 01:42:38,497
Are you really gonna
start on me now?

1286
01:42:39,499 --> 01:42:40,533
No.

1287
01:42:43,070 --> 01:42:44,570
The mistakes you make
are your own.

1288
01:42:44,572 --> 01:42:46,505
Mistake?
Jesus, Mom!

1289
01:42:49,210 --> 01:42:51,144
These risks you're taking...

1290
01:42:51,146 --> 01:42:52,980
I don't know why.

1291
01:42:52,982 --> 01:42:54,948
I'm just trying to keep
this ranch in the family.

1292
01:42:54,950 --> 01:42:55,916
For you.

1293
01:42:59,887 --> 01:43:01,087
For me?

1294
01:43:01,089 --> 01:43:02,355
Yeah.

1295
01:43:02,357 --> 01:43:03,522
This isn't about me.

1296
01:43:04,892 --> 01:43:06,894
Where are you gonna live?

1297
01:43:06,896 --> 01:43:08,462
If we don't have this place,
where are you gonna go?

1298
01:43:08,464 --> 01:43:11,198
Do you honestly think
I give a damn?

1299
01:43:15,970 --> 01:43:17,638
You're doing this for yourself.

1300
01:43:25,447 --> 01:43:27,015
It's eight seconds.

1301
01:43:28,116 --> 01:43:30,217
That's all it is.

1302
01:43:30,219 --> 01:43:33,620
That girl could be
the rest of your life.

1303
01:44:06,188 --> 01:44:07,455
<i>Sophia Danko?</i>

1304
01:44:07,457 --> 01:44:10,224
Uh, yes. This is she.

1305
01:44:10,226 --> 01:44:14,062
<i>My name is Howie Sanders.
I'm the attorney for Ira Levinson.</i>

1306
01:44:14,064 --> 01:44:15,563
<i>I've been trying
to reach you.</i>

1307
01:44:17,434 --> 01:44:19,234
Uh, yeah. What is it?
Is he okay?

1308
01:44:20,270 --> 01:44:21,971
<i>I'm sorry, Ms. Danko.</i>

1309
01:44:23,173 --> 01:44:25,074
<i>He passed away
late last night.</i>

1310
01:44:30,446 --> 01:44:31,646
<i>Ms. Danko?</i>

1311
01:44:33,048 --> 01:44:34,649
<i>Are you all right?</i>

1312
01:44:34,651 --> 01:44:35,651
Yeah.

1313
01:44:38,154 --> 01:44:41,390
<i>Mr. Levinson's art collection is
being auctioned off next week.</i>

1314
01:44:41,392 --> 01:44:44,293
<i>This is a private auction,
and is by invitation only.</i>

1315
01:44:44,295 --> 01:44:46,462
<i>And Ira asked if
you would attend.</i>

1316
01:44:50,433 --> 01:44:52,334
<i>I know this is short notice.</i>

1317
01:44:53,270 --> 01:44:55,071
<i>But it's important to know...</i>

1318
01:44:56,506 --> 01:44:58,307
<i>he was very fond of you.</i>

1319
01:45:02,012 --> 01:45:03,679
I was very fond of him, too.

1320
01:45:06,449 --> 01:45:08,384
<i>Well, I'll send all the
information along.</i>

1321
01:45:10,253 --> 01:45:12,122
<i>It was nice to finally
talk with you.</i>

1322
01:45:14,558 --> 01:45:15,558
Thank you.

1323
01:45:26,603 --> 01:45:30,040
<i>Tonight we're gonna be watching
the top bull riders in the world.</i>

1324
01:45:31,108 --> 01:45:32,308
Aces.

1325
01:46:42,448 --> 01:46:46,418
<i>This is the one
and only PBR!</i>

1326
01:46:50,857 --> 01:46:55,464
<i>Time to meet your
top 15 contenders!</i>

1327
01:46:56,942 --> 01:47:01,366
<i>Being led out by the number-one-ranked
bull rider in the world...</i>

1328
01:47:01,368 --> 01:47:04,469
<i>from Oklahoma,
Jared Middleton!</i>

1329
01:47:04,471 --> 01:47:07,239
<i>Boy, what a fight
it has been...</i>

1330
01:47:07,241 --> 01:47:10,642
<i>between him and the man
from North Carolina...</i>

1331
01:47:10,644 --> 01:47:12,844
<i>Luke Collins!</i>

1332
01:47:12,846 --> 01:47:15,647
<i>It has been an epic battle
between those two...</i>

1333
01:47:15,649 --> 01:47:18,417
<i>for this title!</i>

1334
01:47:18,419 --> 01:47:22,487
<i>But don't count out men
atop that leaderboard!</i>

1335
01:47:22,489 --> 01:47:24,789
<i>We will now go
atop the shark cage...</i>

1336
01:47:24,791 --> 01:47:28,493
<i>for our
championship-round draft.</i>

1337
01:47:28,495 --> 01:47:31,863
<i>Ryan Dirteater, you will have Smackdown.
We will see you soon.</i>

1338
01:47:31,865 --> 01:47:35,368
<i>Now over to Billy Robinson,
the talent from Virginia.</i>

1339
01:47:35,370 --> 01:47:38,171
<i>Billy, let's find out
what bull you will face.</i>

1340
01:47:38,173 --> 01:47:42,675
<i>You are going to face Bushwacker!
Congratulations!</i>

1341
01:47:42,677 --> 01:47:45,845
<i>Now to the fan favorite from
North Carolina, Luke Collins!</i>

1342
01:47:45,847 --> 01:47:48,781
<i>Luke, your fate
is in that cup.</i>

1343
01:47:48,783 --> 01:47:51,316
<i>It is time for you to reach in
and pull out your bull...</i>

1344
01:47:51,318 --> 01:47:53,186
<i>for this championship round.</i>

1345
01:47:53,188 --> 01:47:55,354
<i>Let's see what it will be.</i>

1346
01:47:55,356 --> 01:47:59,225
<i>Luke, you will have the
number-one contender...</i>

1347
01:47:59,227 --> 01:48:01,294
<i>for this year's World
Champion Bucking Bull...</i>

1348
01:48:01,296 --> 01:48:02,495
<i>Rango!</i>

1349
01:48:24,952 --> 01:48:26,652
<i>Okay, Nashville.</i>

1350
01:48:26,654 --> 01:48:28,822
<i>You know who I'm
talking about.</i>

1351
01:48:28,824 --> 01:48:31,658
<i>With 99 consecutive buck-offs...</i>

1352
01:48:31,660 --> 01:48:34,595
<i>and staring down
number 100...</i>

1353
01:48:34,597 --> 01:48:36,930
<i>this is the number-one-ranked
bucking bull in the world!</i>

1354
01:48:44,372 --> 01:48:46,741
<i>He is doing one of the most
difficult things in sports...</i>

1355
01:48:46,743 --> 01:48:49,576
<i>and that is mounting
a comeback.</i>

1356
01:48:49,578 --> 01:48:53,280
<i>Yeah, but Luke Collins,
he is on PBR fire!</i>

1357
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:13,034
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1358
01:49:57,513 --> 01:49:58,781
You got it!
Keep riding!

1359
01:50:21,938 --> 01:50:22,905
Yeah!
Yeah!

1360
01:51:03,948 --> 01:51:06,383
<i>We have just seen
David slay Goliath!</i>

1361
01:51:54,733 --> 01:51:56,934
Hey, Luke, you made
the eight on Rango.

1362
01:51:56,936 --> 01:51:58,035
I knew you were a cowboy.

1363
01:51:59,571 --> 01:52:01,672
One hell of a ride, son, I tell you!

1364
01:52:01,674 --> 01:52:03,575
Luke, we gotta get together
now and talk some business.

1365
01:52:03,577 --> 01:52:05,043
Luke?
Luke, where you going?

1366
01:52:08,881 --> 01:52:10,682
The Levinson artwork
is the largest

1367
01:52:10,684 --> 01:52:13,018
and most valuable
private collection.

1368
01:52:13,020 --> 01:52:15,519
Not only are these pieces sourced
from local Black Mountain College...

1369
01:52:15,521 --> 01:52:17,655
but the world.

1370
01:52:17,657 --> 01:52:19,557
We'll look at contemporary
modern artists...

1371
01:52:19,559 --> 01:52:21,726
such as Andy Warhol, Pat Passlof,
and Willem de Kooning.

1372
01:52:22,728 --> 01:52:24,729
These are amazing works of art...

1373
01:52:24,731 --> 01:52:27,065
and incredibly diverse,
as you already know.

1374
01:52:27,067 --> 01:52:29,768
Never been seen in one place
like this before.

1375
01:52:29,770 --> 01:52:31,236
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen

1376
01:52:31,238 --> 01:52:33,972
for attending this
remarkable auction.

1377
01:52:33,974 --> 01:52:36,241
If everyone could
take their seats, please.

1378
01:52:36,243 --> 01:52:38,977
I know we are all eager
to get started.

1379
01:52:41,715 --> 01:52:43,882
Before we begin,
a personal note.

1380
01:52:47,753 --> 01:52:50,755
Welcome.
I'm Howard Sanders.

1381
01:52:50,757 --> 01:52:52,824
I was Ruth and Ira
Levinson's attorney...

1382
01:52:52,826 --> 01:52:54,960
for more than 25 years.

1383
01:52:54,962 --> 01:52:57,897
Now, Ira's will
is very detailed...

1384
01:52:58,899 --> 01:53:01,234
on how he wants to
proceed today.

1385
01:53:01,236 --> 01:53:03,569
So, let me start by reading
you a letter he wrote...

1386
01:53:04,671 --> 01:53:05,671
specifically for the occasion.

1387
01:53:07,508 --> 01:53:10,009
"My name is Ira Levinson.

1388
01:53:10,011 --> 01:53:14,813
"I'm an ordinary man who fell in
love with an extraordinary woman.

1389
01:53:14,815 --> 01:53:19,151
"Around this room you will see some
beautiful and priceless works of art.

1390
01:53:19,153 --> 01:53:23,022
"Ruth had an incredible
eye for talent...

1391
01:53:23,024 --> 01:53:25,224
"while I only had eyes for her.

1392
01:53:26,793 --> 01:53:28,594
"For me...

1393
01:53:28,596 --> 01:53:32,298
"the great joy of collecting
wasn't in the art itself... "

1394
01:53:32,300 --> 01:53:34,001
<i>...but in the person
I collected it with.</i>

1395
01:53:34,836 --> 01:53:36,203
<i>My beloved Ruth.</i>

1396
01:53:36,205 --> 01:53:40,107
<i>The happiness these paintings
brought her was immeasurable.</i>

1397
01:53:41,543 --> 01:53:42,575
<i>And sharing that happiness...</i>

1398
01:53:43,777 --> 01:53:45,144
<i>was the great privilege
of my life.</i>

1399
01:53:46,947 --> 01:53:49,115
<i>We celebrated,
we achieved.</i>

1400
01:53:49,117 --> 01:53:51,718
<i>We endured,
we compromised.</i>

1401
01:53:52,120 --> 01:53:53,120
<i>And above all...</i>

1402
01:53:54,022 --> 01:53:55,222
<i>we loved.</i>

1403
01:53:56,624 --> 01:53:58,258
<i>The true work of art...</i>

1404
01:53:58,260 --> 01:54:00,294
<i>was the longest ride
Ruth and I shared.</i>

1405
01:54:01,095 --> 01:54:02,863
<i>This thing called life.</i>

1406
01:54:04,966 --> 01:54:08,335
<i>There's not a painting here I
wouldn't trade in a heartbeat...</i>

1407
01:54:08,337 --> 01:54:10,004
<i>to hear her voice.</i>

1408
01:54:11,806 --> 01:54:13,307
<i>Or see her smile.</i>

1409
01:54:15,343 --> 01:54:17,344
<i>Just one more time.</i>

1410
01:54:17,346 --> 01:54:18,612
Signed, Ira Levinson.

1411
01:54:22,750 --> 01:54:24,818
Thank you all for coming.

1412
01:54:29,625 --> 01:54:31,259
Thank you, Mr. Sanders.

1413
01:54:35,130 --> 01:54:38,600

1419
01:54:58,989 --> 01:55:02,758
Who has $1,000 for me?

1420
01:55:02,760 --> 01:55:04,893
How about $800?
Who can give me $800?

1429
01:55:31,321 --> 01:55:32,788
Fair warning.

1430

Sold to the young man
right there for $600.

1431
01:55:44,300 --> 01:55:46,935
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're going to take a short pause.

1432
01:55:46,937 --> 01:55:49,705
We can take this time
to look at the next item...

1433
01:55:49,707 --> 01:55:51,040
which will be a Jackson Pollock.

1434
01:55:51,042 --> 01:55:53,375
That's located on page 124.

1435
01:56:06,057 --> 01:56:07,357
There we go.

1436
01:56:07,359 --> 01:56:08,857
What are you doing here?

1437
01:56:12,162 --> 01:56:13,929
Ira invited me.

1438
01:56:19,804 --> 01:56:21,137
I'm done bull riding, Sophia.

1439
01:56:23,107 --> 01:56:24,874
I'm done.

1440
01:56:27,111 --> 01:56:29,145
Look, I drew Rango
this afternoon.

1441
01:56:31,348 --> 01:56:33,884
I thought if I could just
ride that son of a bitch...

1442
01:56:33,886 --> 01:56:36,220
if I could just make the eight...

1443
01:56:36,222 --> 01:56:37,755
I'd have everything
I ever wanted.

1444
01:56:39,090 --> 01:56:41,157
Well, I did.
I rode him.

1445
01:56:43,194 --> 01:56:44,294
So, you're the best.

1446
01:56:44,995 --> 01:56:46,830
No.
Not even close.

1447
01:56:48,933 --> 01:56:51,001
You see, the whole time
I was thinking about you.

1448
01:56:54,039 --> 01:56:56,774
I realized that what I want is
standing right in front of me.

1449
01:57:16,228 --> 01:57:18,062
What made you buy
that painting?

1450
01:57:19,431 --> 01:57:20,531
Ira.

1451
01:57:26,072 --> 01:57:27,806
Excuse me, sir.
We need you in the other room.

1452
01:57:28,875 --> 01:57:30,342
Sir?
Not now.

1453
01:57:31,878 --> 01:57:33,111
- Sir?
- Not now.

1454
01:57:33,113 --> 01:57:34,179
Mr. Sanders needs you.

1455
01:57:42,421 --> 01:57:44,489
Quiet!
Quiet, please!

1456
01:57:45,224 --> 01:57:46,925
What is your name, son?

1457
01:57:47,960 --> 01:57:49,928
Luke Collins.

1458
01:57:49,930 --> 01:57:51,463
<i>And did you just close your
purchase of Portrait of Ruth?</i>

1459
01:57:52,865 --> 01:57:54,399
Yes.

1460
01:57:54,401 --> 01:57:56,835
Mr. Collins,
I have a stipulation...

1461
01:57:56,837 --> 01:58:00,505
in Ira Levinson's will
I need to read to you.

1462
01:58:00,507 --> 01:58:04,310
<i>"Portrait of Ruth may not be the most
valuable painting in my collection...</i>

1463
01:58:04,312 --> 01:58:06,311
"but it was the most
precious to me...

1464
01:58:06,313 --> 01:58:09,281
"because it reminded me daily
of my beloved Ruth.

1465
01:58:09,283 --> 01:58:11,850
"And so, the terms
of my will are simple.

1466
01:58:11,852 --> 01:58:14,286
"Whoever purchases
the portrait...

1467
01:58:14,288 --> 01:58:16,555
"will receive the collection
in its entirety. "

1468
01:58:18,559 --> 01:58:21,561
Ladies and gentlemen,
this auction is over.

1469
01:58:21,563 --> 01:58:23,262
What?

1470
01:58:23,264 --> 01:58:26,599
This is worth millions.
Millions of dollars.

1471
01:58:26,601 --> 01:58:28,201
How much do you want
for the Warhols?

1472
01:58:28,203 --> 01:58:30,002
What are your plans for
the Jackson Pollocks?

1473
01:58:30,004 --> 01:58:31,270
I have a client who wants
to buy both of the Picassos.

1474
01:58:33,307 --> 01:58:34,974
I'll write you a check.

1475
01:58:38,345 --> 01:58:41,147
Sorry.

1476
01:58:41,149 --> 01:58:44,183
I'm gonna guess that your head
is spinning right about now.

1477
01:58:44,185 --> 01:58:46,619
Yeah.
That's a good guess.

1478
01:58:46,621 --> 01:58:49,155
When your feet
hit the ground, call me.

1479
01:58:50,490 --> 01:58:53,025
You are now
a very wealthy man.

1480
01:59:47,582 --> 01:59:48,582
Hey.

1481
01:59:50,986 --> 01:59:51,953
Hi.

1482
01:59:55,991 --> 01:59:57,558
How was the museum?

1483
01:59:57,560 --> 01:59:59,160
Great.

1484
01:59:59,695 --> 02:00:01,629
How was the ranch?

1485
02:00:01,997 --> 02:00:03,031
Great.

1486
02:00:44,374 --> 02:00:47,443
"Dearest Ruth... "

1487
02:00:47,445 --> 02:00:51,547
<i>When a North Carolina boy meets
a beautiful girl from far away...</i>

1488
02:00:51,549 --> 02:00:55,184
<i>he should do everything
he can to win her over.</i>

1489
02:00:55,186 --> 02:00:58,187
<i>And if he does...</i>

1490
02:00:58,189 --> 02:01:00,089
<i>his life will be
a portrait of happiness.</i>

1491
02:01:11,568 --> 02:01:12,735
What?
Come on!

1492
02:01:15,739 --> 02:01:17,373
Where are you going?

1493
02:01:17,375 --> 02:01:18,674
Come on!

1494
02:01:45,603 --> 02:01:47,337
What took you so long?

1495
