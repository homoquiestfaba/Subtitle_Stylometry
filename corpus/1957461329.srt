I'll not see good food wasted.

- He ate the black pudding.
- He can't live on that!

This is the latest trick. Demanding
black pudding, lettin' on he's a rat!

your Uncle Matt. If you think...

I'm a freelance journalist.

- She's not in.

00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:23,121
Marietta, come here
and hold your father's mouth open.

91
00:07:23,216 --> 00:07:26,170
- Yeah.
- What's that man doing in the door?

92
00:07:26,261 --> 00:07:28,218
- He's a reporter.
- I'm not.

93
00:07:28,305 --> 00:07:30,796
- What's he want?
- To write about you.

94
00:07:30,891 --> 00:07:32,302
I don't.

95
00:07:32,392 --> 00:07:35,429
He'll write nothing in the papers
about me.

96
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,889
- On your bike.
- I wouldn't write it, you would.

97
00:07:38,982 --> 00:07:40,809
What was that again?

98
00:07:40,901 --> 00:07:44,104
- You'd be writing it yourself.
- In the paper?

99
00:07:44,196 --> 00:07:45,773
No, a book.

100
00:07:45,864 --> 00:07:48,154
- A book?!
- Your own story.

101
00:07:48,241 --> 00:07:50,732
You would write it, and I would help.

102
00:07:50,827 --> 00:07:54,280
- I would write a book?
- First a book, then a film.

103
00:07:55,415 --> 00:07:57,740
A film of the book?

104
00:07:57,834 --> 00:07:59,626
And then a book of the film.

105
00:08:02,756 --> 00:08:04,713
(Phelim) And the video.

106
00:08:06,218 --> 00:08:09,635
I apologise for keeping
you standing in the hall.

107
00:08:09,721 --> 00:08:13,090
- Come on, Felix, meet me husband.
- It's Phelim.

108
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:16,350
What are youse waiting for?

109
00:08:16,436 --> 00:08:19,687
Do you think he's going to appear
on the balcony?

110
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:29,365
- You'll have to excuse the place.
- It's charming, Mrs Flynn.

111
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:32,443
And this would be your sister?

112
00:08:32,536 --> 00:08:35,371
- It's me daughter, Marietta.
- Go 'way!

113
00:08:35,455 --> 00:08:38,030
And this is me son, Pius.

114
00:08:38,124 --> 00:08:41,126
- He's going to be a priest.
- Oh.

115
00:08:42,212 --> 00:08:46,293
And this is me husband, Hubert,
the head of the family.

116
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:49,633
(Phelim) I see he's a white rat.

117
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:52,210
Of course he is.
Wasn't he a white man?

118
00:08:52,305 --> 00:08:55,758
It'd be unnatural for a white man
to turn into a black rat.

119
00:08:55,851 --> 00:08:58,769
I thought you'd have the brains
to see that.

120
00:08:58,854 --> 00:09:00,764
Can I ask him a few questions?

121
00:09:00,856 --> 00:09:04,937
To get on his wavelength,
excavate his innermost thoughts.

122
00:09:05,026 --> 00:09:07,186
Go on, then. Shift over, Pius.

123
00:09:10,991 --> 00:09:14,408
Last night, Hubert,
you turned into a rat.

124
00:09:15,745 --> 00:09:17,572
He knows that, Felix.

125
00:09:17,664 --> 00:09:20,203
Before and during your metamorphosis,

126
00:09:20,292 --> 00:09:23,080
were you conscious
of rapid metabolic change?

127
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:26,752
Sudden shrinking of the brain
or other vital organs?

128
00:09:28,383 --> 00:09:30,922
Do you hear the man talking to you?

129
00:09:31,011 --> 00:09:35,886
Were you at any time aware of human
and animal consciousness merging?

130
00:09:35,974 --> 00:09:38,299
Any increase of intuitive responses

131
00:09:38,393 --> 00:09:41,845
aligned to a diminution
of the powers of reasoning?

132
00:09:44,482 --> 00:09:46,440
You're wasting your breath.

133
00:09:46,526 --> 00:09:49,646
He was contrary as a man,
he's contrary as a rat.

134
00:09:49,738 --> 00:09:53,356
Look at him picking at his food!
He'd put years on you.

135
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,989
You're not the only one
with problems.

136
00:09:59,331 --> 00:10:02,285
It's natural
that he shouldn't talk to me.

137
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:05,377
I'm a stranger
and he has had a severe shock.

138
00:10:05,462 --> 00:10:08,215
There's more than him
had a severe shock.

139
00:10:08,298 --> 00:10:12,794
I have to gain his confidence.
You know? Earn his trust.

140
00:10:12,886 --> 00:10:16,634
There's only one thing for it -
I'll have to move in.

141
00:10:16,723 --> 00:10:18,847
- In here?
- I have to capture

142
00:10:18,934 --> 00:10:21,888
the true day-to-day,
intimate human story,

143
00:10:21,978 --> 00:10:25,514
the tenderness and heartbreak,
the joy and sadness,

144
00:10:25,607 --> 00:10:29,735
the tears and laughter
of one brave woman's life with a rat.

145
00:10:31,112 --> 00:10:32,820
What do you say, Pius?

146
00:10:32,906 --> 00:10:35,315
Ask him about money.

147
00:10:35,408 --> 00:10:37,235
What about money?

148
00:10:37,327 --> 00:10:40,080
Well, I have a draught contract,

149
00:10:40,163 --> 00:10:43,912
giving full protection
to the interests of all concerned.

150
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,705
It's awful,
making a spectacle out of him.

151
00:10:46,795 --> 00:10:50,746
What do you think he's doing?
We'll be all over the papers.

152
00:10:50,841 --> 00:10:55,254
- Nobody must talk to the papers.
- Wasn't it on the wireless?

153
00:10:55,345 --> 00:10:59,212
It was on Radio Kimmage.
Who listens to Radio Kimmage?

154
00:10:59,307 --> 00:11:03,435
If people read the story in
the paper, they won't buy the book.

155
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,347
Do you understand now?

156
00:11:05,438 --> 00:11:08,855
Just promise you won't make
a spectacle of him.

157
00:11:10,694 --> 00:11:13,813
It'll be a heart-warming story,
Miss Flynn.

158
00:11:13,905 --> 00:11:15,815
Like Born Free.

159
00:11:15,907 --> 00:11:18,149
Where will he sleep?

160
00:11:18,243 --> 00:11:22,657
- Come on, I'll show you, Felix.
- It's not Felix, it's Phelim.

161
00:11:22,747 --> 00:11:25,417
He works unsociable hours
on the bread vans,

162
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,368
so he sleeps downstairs
so as not to disturb the family.

163
00:11:32,757 --> 00:11:34,715
There's only one bed.

164
00:11:34,801 --> 00:11:36,877
Well, how many beds do you want?

165
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,758
Do you mean
that I'm to sleep with Hubert?

166
00:11:39,848 --> 00:11:43,894
Ah, no. Hubert wouldn't have that
at all. No, no offence now.

167
00:11:43,977 --> 00:11:46,848
No, no, we have this for Hubert.

168
00:11:46,938 --> 00:11:50,189
See, his little ladder
and a bowl of water

169
00:11:50,275 --> 00:11:52,150
and a little bell.

170
00:11:52,235 --> 00:11:56,530
His swing and a little lick-stone
to stop his teeth growing.

171
00:11:57,699 --> 00:11:59,858
See, nothing's been spared.

172
00:11:59,951 --> 00:12:01,862
He's a very lucky rat.

173
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:09,578
Is this where it all happened,
Mrs Flynn?

174
00:12:09,669 --> 00:12:13,418
On that very bed. Those were
the clothes he was wearing.

175
00:12:13,507 --> 00:12:17,635
He was just in from the pub,
laying down with his paper,

176
00:12:17,719 --> 00:12:20,839
picking out the horses for tomorrow.

177
00:12:20,931 --> 00:12:25,724
And I was going around the room,
collecting up the dirty clothes

178
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:31,600
and making a few gentle remarks
on the subject of personal hygiene.

179
00:12:31,691 --> 00:12:35,559
And he was lying there, like,
letting on he didn't hear me.

180
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:39,355
So...I was quietly ripping
the newspaper out of his hand

181
00:12:39,449 --> 00:12:42,451
in order to gain
his attention when...

182
00:12:45,413 --> 00:12:48,830
I'm sorry, Felix.
I'm not the better of it yet.

183
00:12:48,917 --> 00:12:53,164
Er...well, there on the bed,

184
00:12:53,255 --> 00:12:57,632
just as you see it now,
was the clothes...

185
00:12:57,717 --> 00:12:59,758
and nothing in them.

186
00:13:00,971 --> 00:13:04,174
I stood there, not able to speak...

187
00:13:06,768 --> 00:13:09,177
because he was gone, you see?

188
00:13:12,941 --> 00:13:14,898
And then it happened.

189
00:13:16,361 --> 00:13:19,398
Under the pullover,
something stirred.

190
00:13:21,241 --> 00:13:25,239
And out from the collar
of his shirt...

191
00:13:25,328 --> 00:13:28,033
crawled a rat.

192
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,159
The rest, Felix, is history.

193
00:13:34,004 --> 00:13:36,163
(Phelim) 'What did you do next?'

194
00:13:36,256 --> 00:13:39,044
(Mrs Flynn)
'I sent for me brother, Matt.'

195
00:13:39,134 --> 00:13:41,091
Excuse me.

196
00:13:42,429 --> 00:13:44,802
I think that's him after coming in.

197
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,511
Come and meet him.
He's a rock of sense.

198
00:13:47,601 --> 00:13:50,222
If anybody can solve the problem,
it's Matt.

199
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:55,564
Thank God you're here, Matt.
This is Felix Spratt.

200
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,726
- Phelim.
- How are you, Felix?

201
00:13:57,819 --> 00:14:00,275
Sit down.
Marietta, shift your father.

202
00:14:00,363 --> 00:14:02,523
Ma, come on. That's Da's seat.

203
00:14:03,867 --> 00:14:06,536
The greasy bit
where he leaned his head.

204
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:10,037
The little roundy marks
of the pint glass.

205
00:14:10,123 --> 00:14:12,283
- Will you...?
- Leave him be.

206
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:15,128
I'm grand where I am.

207
00:14:15,212 --> 00:14:17,453
Felix and me
is going to write a book.

208
00:14:17,547 --> 00:14:19,754
- A book?
- A book about Hubert.

209
00:14:19,841 --> 00:14:21,549
Will it be a mystery?

210
00:14:21,635 --> 00:14:24,043
- It'll have mysterious bits.
- Oh.

211
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:29,974
Well, Conchita, this is gonna have
serious repercussions.

212
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,100
- It is, Matt.
- For a start,

213
00:14:32,187 --> 00:14:34,014
looking on the bright side,

214
00:14:34,105 --> 00:14:37,190
we should be grateful
it was a rat he turned into.

215
00:14:37,275 --> 00:14:39,067
What are you saying?

216
00:14:39,152 --> 00:14:43,364
It could have been something worse,
he could have turned into a vulture.

217
00:14:43,448 --> 00:14:47,743
It may be hard to feed a rat,
but imagine feeding a vulture.

218
00:14:47,827 --> 00:14:51,778
You'd feel very nervous closing
your eyes for a kip after dinner

219
00:14:51,873 --> 00:14:54,246
with a Vulturus monachus
on the mantelpiece?

220
00:14:54,334 --> 00:14:57,537
A giraffe would be worse again.

221
00:14:57,629 --> 00:15:00,298
Tell us about the repercussions.

222
00:15:00,382 --> 00:15:02,422
Well, on the subject of diet,

223
00:15:02,509 --> 00:15:06,376
the rat, or to give him his proper
title, Rattus norvegicus,

224
00:15:06,471 --> 00:15:08,013
is omnivorious.

225
00:15:08,098 --> 00:15:10,589
What's om...nivorious, Matt?

226
00:15:10,684 --> 00:15:14,551
They'll eat anythin'! Nothing
pleases a rat like potato skins,

227
00:15:14,646 --> 00:15:17,481
onion peelings,
so you'll save on the grub.

228
00:15:17,566 --> 00:15:20,484
But the bad part is,
if he's not watched,

229
00:15:20,569 --> 00:15:23,404
he'd eat the sofa
or the paper off the wall.

230
00:15:23,488 --> 00:15:27,071
Point number three.
Do any of you here know

231
00:15:27,158 --> 00:15:30,160
the average life span
of the common rat?

232
00:15:30,245 --> 00:15:33,282
- (Conchita) No.
- Two and three quarter years

233
00:15:33,373 --> 00:15:36,078
is the average life span
of a common rat.

234
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:38,956
Eh, just remind me,
what age is Hubert?

235
00:15:39,045 --> 00:15:41,003
He's 53.

236
00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:46,214
Well, in that case, what you have
there is a very elderly rat.

237
00:15:46,303 --> 00:15:48,427
There's good and bad in that.

238
00:15:48,513 --> 00:15:50,554
Give us the good part, Matt.

239
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,887
Well, he's probably the oldest rat
in the history of the world.

240
00:15:54,978 --> 00:15:57,849
- What's good about that?
- It's a matter of pride!

241
00:15:57,939 --> 00:16:02,353
There might even be money to be made.
You could take him on a tour

242
00:16:02,444 --> 00:16:06,311
- or lease him out to a circus.
- You'll do no such thing!

243
00:16:06,406 --> 00:16:08,648
Don't interrupt your Uncle Matt.

244
00:16:08,742 --> 00:16:12,111
Just promise me
you'll do nothing till I get home.

245
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:14,280
He'll be here when you get back.

246
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,243
Now the bad part, Matt.

247
00:16:18,335 --> 00:16:20,494
Personal hygiene.

248
00:16:20,587 --> 00:16:22,793
He's got terrible dirty.

249
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:26,214
He was so particular.
Now, it's when the notion takes him.

250
00:16:26,301 --> 00:16:29,421
- That is...
- No matter where he is, he lets fly.

251
00:16:29,513 --> 00:16:31,754
As I was trying to explain to you,

252
00:16:31,848 --> 00:16:34,886
that is his nature,
it's training he wants.

253
00:16:34,976 --> 00:16:39,638
If you did train him, he can't stand
in the lavatory, he's not the height.

254
00:16:39,731 --> 00:16:42,685
You can't lift him up
in case he'd fall in and drown.

255
00:16:42,776 --> 00:16:46,904
Nothing worse than a drowned rat in
the toilet - close relation or not.

256
00:16:46,988 --> 00:16:51,319
The only answer is, someone will have
to go in with him and hold him out.

257
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:55,155
You'll all have to take turns.

258
00:16:56,164 --> 00:16:58,703
And fifthly and finally,

259
00:16:58,792 --> 00:17:00,667
he'll have to give up the job.

260
00:17:00,752 --> 00:17:04,003
People doesn't want their bread
delivered by a rat...

261
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:07,874
which brings us to the subject
of unemployment benefit.

262
00:17:07,968 --> 00:17:12,713
I went to the Labour this morning
to inquire about Hubert signing on.

263
00:17:12,806 --> 00:17:15,048
- And?
- Unreservedly rejected.

264
00:17:15,141 --> 00:17:17,515
Well, wouldn't you know!

265
00:17:17,602 --> 00:17:22,893
Twenty-five years, never a day sick,
and the minute misfortune strikes...

266
00:17:22,983 --> 00:17:25,735
Think of the questions
that'd be asked.

267
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:30,445
"Is the Minister aware that
benefit is being claimed by a rat?"

268
00:17:30,532 --> 00:17:34,613
- Hubert isn't just a rat.
- I know that and you know it.

269
00:17:34,703 --> 00:17:38,155
But you have to admit,
appearances are against him.

270
00:17:38,248 --> 00:17:42,163
They'll think if they let one rat
sign on, they'll all want to.

271
00:17:42,252 --> 00:17:44,458
Rats would come from near and far.

272
00:17:44,546 --> 00:17:47,215
Then, they'd find work
for one of them.

273
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:50,632
Before you know,
you'd have the union organising them.

274
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:55,761
- Conchita, fair is fair.
- I can see a likeness all the same.

275
00:17:58,894 --> 00:18:02,346
<i>♪</i> You can only love someone so much

276
00:18:02,647 --> 00:18:05,815
<i>♪</i> You can only love someone so much

277
00:18:05,901 --> 00:18:07,893
<i>♪</i> You can only love someone... <i>♪</i>

278
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:10,655
- Marietta...
- Yes, Rudolph?

279
00:18:10,739 --> 00:18:12,696
When are you going to ask me in?

280
00:18:12,782 --> 00:18:15,571
I don't think we should rush things.

281
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,365
We've been going out for 18 months.

282
00:18:18,455 --> 00:18:20,780
When am I going to meet your parents?

283
00:18:22,626 --> 00:18:24,750
Do you hear me, Marietta?

284
00:18:24,836 --> 00:18:26,746
You could meet me mother.

285
00:18:26,838 --> 00:18:30,041
- What's wrong with your father?
- Nothing!

286
00:18:30,133 --> 00:18:32,174
Why'd you say that?

287
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,751
I didn't mean
that something was wrong.

288
00:18:34,846 --> 00:18:37,717
I...just ASKED if there was something
wrong with him.

289
00:18:37,807 --> 00:18:40,678
There's nothing wrong
with me father, OK?

290
00:18:40,769 --> 00:18:43,059
Right.

291
00:18:43,146 --> 00:18:45,721
I don't even know your father's name.

292
00:18:45,815 --> 00:18:48,057
It's Hubert.

293
00:18:48,151 --> 00:18:51,769
It's an old family name.

294
00:18:51,863 --> 00:18:54,983
It's from the Huguenots.

295
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,582
(Bell chimes)

296
00:19:10,841 --> 00:19:13,759
- (Man) Father's name?
- Hubert Flynn.

297
00:19:15,512 --> 00:19:18,003
Hubert Flynn?

298
00:19:18,098 --> 00:19:21,681
I've heard that name lately.
Was it on the wireless?

299
00:19:21,768 --> 00:19:25,553
You're maybe thinking of...
Errol Flynn.

300
00:19:25,647 --> 00:19:27,972
I know that name too.
ls he your uncle?

301
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:30,391
No. Matt's me uncle.

302
00:19:30,485 --> 00:19:34,566
- I never heard of Matt Flynn.
- Not Matt Flynn, Matt Moriarty.

303
00:19:34,656 --> 00:19:36,732
And who's Errol Flynn?

304
00:19:36,825 --> 00:19:38,949
He was a film star.

305
00:19:39,035 --> 00:19:41,076
And he's not your uncle?

306
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,949
Tell us, Father,

307
00:19:48,044 --> 00:19:51,627
is there such a thing
as a bar to the priesthood?

308
00:19:51,715 --> 00:19:54,420
Anything...like...

309
00:19:54,509 --> 00:19:57,262
of a hereditary nature...

310
00:19:57,345 --> 00:20:01,047
that might disqualify you
from becoming a priest?

311
00:20:02,767 --> 00:20:06,979
If a man was descended
from a long line of Lunatics,

312
00:20:07,063 --> 00:20:09,852
or degenerates or criminals,

313
00:20:09,941 --> 00:20:13,228
then there'd be no place for him
in the priesthood.

314
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,645
But that wouldn't mean he were bad.

315
00:20:15,739 --> 00:20:19,820
You see, Pius,
a vocation is a call from God.

316
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,199
If there was anything
wrong with that man,

317
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:25,989
God would know as God knows
everything, so God wouldn't call him.

318
00:20:26,082 --> 00:20:28,918
If the man thought
that God was calling him,

319
00:20:29,002 --> 00:20:31,755
he'd only be codding himself.

320
00:20:31,838 --> 00:20:34,294
Do you follow me?

321
00:20:34,382 --> 00:20:37,301
You can't cod God.

322
00:20:41,097 --> 00:20:43,387
Now, father's occupation?

323
00:20:44,267 --> 00:20:46,391
(Conchita) Ah, will you look at that?

324
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:48,353
(Marietta) What? What is it?

325
00:20:48,438 --> 00:20:52,056
Droppings on the doilies.

326
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:55,188
Ah, now that's going
beyond the beyonds.

327
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:03,154
- Something will have to be done.
- I've been thinking about that.

328
00:21:03,245 --> 00:21:07,242
- Yes, Son.
- From the Church's point of view.

329
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:09,159
Listen to your brother now.

330
00:21:09,251 --> 00:21:11,492
Animals were created to serve man.

331
00:21:11,586 --> 00:21:14,540
- Says who?
- It's in the Bible. Page one.

332
00:21:14,631 --> 00:21:15,829
Go on, Son.

333
00:21:15,924 --> 00:21:18,333
God said,
"Let us make man in our image.

334
00:21:18,426 --> 00:21:20,586
"Let him have dominion over the fish,

335
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:24,178
"and of the fowl of the air,
the cattle and over all the earth.

336
00:21:24,266 --> 00:21:28,513
"And over every creeping thing
that creepeth over the earth."

337
00:21:28,603 --> 00:21:31,094
Creeping things come last of all,
you see.

338
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:34,476
So what should we do, Son,
as a Catholic family?

339
00:21:34,568 --> 00:21:36,692
I think we should kill him.

340
00:21:36,778 --> 00:21:38,902
God forgive you! That's rotten.

341
00:21:38,989 --> 00:21:42,406
You're gonna be a priest,
you're called after 12 popes

342
00:21:42,492 --> 00:21:44,616
and you'd kill your da, you shite!

343
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:48,488
Don't talk that way to a walking
saint who never had a bad thought.

344
00:21:48,582 --> 00:21:52,532
- Except wanting to kill his da!
- He's not me da, he's a rat.

345
00:21:52,627 --> 00:21:54,917
It isn't his fault.
He never intended it.

346
00:21:55,005 --> 00:21:57,840
Don't be so sure.
He'd do it to annoy me.

347
00:21:57,924 --> 00:22:01,377
At the same time, Pius,
bad and all as he is,

348
00:22:01,469 --> 00:22:03,795
I don't think I could kill him.

349
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:05,597
I only said what's in the Bible.

350
00:22:05,682 --> 00:22:09,728
I say he's our father and we
should treat him like a human being.

351
00:22:09,811 --> 00:22:11,804
He shouldn't be locked in a cage.

352
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:15,183
We should bring him for walks
to see his friends.

353
00:22:15,275 --> 00:22:17,648
Do you hear the impudence of that?

354
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:19,860
If you're so fond of your father,

355
00:22:19,946 --> 00:22:22,781
why don't you bring your boyfriend
home to meet him?

356
00:22:22,866 --> 00:22:25,108
The way any natural daughter would.

357
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:35,163
Now...I hope all that
didn't upset you, Son.

358
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:37,045
No.

359
00:22:44,471 --> 00:22:47,425
I'll just take your father
out of your way.

360
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:53,928
(Clears throat) Hiya.

361
00:22:55,023 --> 00:22:57,811
I brought Hubert in
to keep you company.

362
00:22:57,901 --> 00:23:00,392
Thank you, Conchita.

363
00:23:00,487 --> 00:23:03,655
Lovely name, that - Conchita.

364
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,528
I'd say there's Spanish blood.

365
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:08,694
There is, yeah. Far back.

366
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:12,535
Yeah, you can tell,
the untamed spirit.

367
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:16,534
- How's the book?
- It's going well.

368
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:21,585
I'm after thinking up another title.

369
00:23:21,675 --> 00:23:25,293
My Secret Rat.

370
00:23:25,387 --> 00:23:28,389

Ah, no, you don't like it.

374
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:42,068
You see, Conchita,
the theme of the book...

375
00:23:42,153 --> 00:23:45,440
is the bravery of a woman
pursued by tragic forces,

376
00:23:45,532 --> 00:23:49,150
standing by her husband,
defying the mockery of the world.

377
00:23:49,244 --> 00:23:51,320
There's no place for secrecy.

378
00:23:51,413 --> 00:23:53,489
You're quite right, Felix.

379
00:23:53,582 --> 00:23:56,868
You have to understand

Your name will be a household word

383

Look, it's not meself I'm worried
for, Felix, it's the children.

384
00:24:11,474 --> 00:24:14,428
When the world knows
their father is a rat...

385
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:17,058
It's the price of fame, Conchita.

386
00:24:19,816 --> 00:24:23,944
I couldn't help hearing
the discussion you and Marietta had.

387
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:25,939
I think Marietta was right.

388
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:30,028
Bring him out, let him meet
his old mates, take him to the pub.

389
00:24:30,118 --> 00:24:33,156
Could we not wait a bit?
Till the book comes out.

390
00:24:33,246 --> 00:24:36,034
Conchita,
there's no use putting it off.

391
00:24:36,124 --> 00:24:39,742
You know that song you were singing,
My Secret Rat?

392
00:24:39,836 --> 00:24:41,912
Do you remember how it finishes?

393
00:24:42,005 --> 00:24:43,915

Go to the attic and get the bassinet.

401
00:25:30,804 --> 00:25:33,674
Mary, would you look!

402
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:37,716
<i>- Sacred heart!

403

Ah, the poor little thing.

404
00:25:42,232 --> 00:25:44,391
Look, there's a rat in a pram.

405
00:25:44,484 --> 00:25:46,774
- Look at it!
- What is his name?

406
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:52,444
Can he do any tricks?
Missus, can he do any tricks?

407
00:25:54,244 --> 00:25:56,154
Would you open the door, Pius?

408
00:25:56,246 --> 00:26:01,157
- Priests can't be seen in bookies.
- They've been seen in worse. Go on.

409
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:18,433
Did you ever in your life see such
a collection of dossers, knackers,

410
00:26:18,518 --> 00:26:21,009
gougers and gurriers
all in one place?

411
00:26:21,104 --> 00:26:23,513
Do you see anybody you know, Da?

412
00:26:26,234 --> 00:26:28,987
Is anybody here a friend
of Hubert Flynn's?

413
00:26:32,032 --> 00:26:34,072
Is it really Hubert?

414
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,536
As soon as I seen him,
says I, "I've seen that face before."

415
00:26:38,622 --> 00:26:41,908
- How's it going?
- Anything you fancy at the Curragh?

416
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,499
Excuse me, missus,
would you mind removing yourself

417
00:26:45,587 --> 00:26:47,414
and that dirty animal?

418
00:26:47,506 --> 00:26:49,498
Which dirty animal is that?

419
00:26:49,591 --> 00:26:52,593
Just move yourself
before you empty the place.

420
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:55,679
The best way to empty this place
is with a bar of soap.

421
00:26:55,764 --> 00:26:57,508
Hubert, we're leaving.

422
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:00,719
(Man) Good luck, Hubert,
and mind yourself.

423
00:27:22,624 --> 00:27:24,617
Ah, will you look who it is?

424
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:26,417
Me life on you, Hubert.

425
00:27:26,503 --> 00:27:28,579
- Conchita.
- How are you, Mick?

426
00:27:28,672 --> 00:27:30,961
Heard about your trouble.
ls it himself?

427
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:33,209
- It is.
- Ah, poor old Hubert.

428
00:27:33,301 --> 00:27:35,176
Sadly missed, you know.

429
00:27:35,262 --> 00:27:37,836
Still, he's not looking too bad.

430
00:27:37,931 --> 00:27:41,514
He's got a healthy coat.
Give him some air, lads.

431
00:27:42,644 --> 00:27:44,471
Er, would he fancy a pint?

432
00:27:44,563 --> 00:27:46,769
I don't think he'd be able for it.

433
00:27:46,857 --> 00:27:50,807
- Ah, really fond of his pint.
- (Men) He was, yes.

434
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:54,687
Mind you now,
he was never too heavy on it.

435
00:27:54,781 --> 00:27:58,317
Seven or eight pints of an evening
would do him fine.

436
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,783
Are you sure he wouldn't like a sup?

437
00:28:00,871 --> 00:28:02,828
Ah, sure, what harm, Ma?

438
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:04,871
Ah, go on so.

439
00:28:11,631 --> 00:28:13,624
(Man) There you go, Hubert.

440
00:28:13,717 --> 00:28:15,627
(All chattering)

441
00:28:15,719 --> 00:28:17,711
(Man) Go on, Hubert.

442
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:24,637
(2nd man) Ah, get it into you now.

443
00:28:26,688 --> 00:28:28,645
You see? He remembers.

444
00:28:28,732 --> 00:28:31,306
You never lose the taste.

445
00:28:31,401 --> 00:28:35,186
- Will you look at that?!
- Get him out! He'll be drownded.

446
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,237
Isn't that desperate?

447
00:28:37,324 --> 00:28:40,610
Oh, we have to get him home
and dry him out.

448
00:28:40,702 --> 00:28:43,989
There you go.
Would he like another sup?

449
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,284
No more now, Mick.
He's not the man he was.

450
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:49,914
I'd better go and wash me hands.

451
00:28:50,003 --> 00:28:51,960
- Sacred heart.
- What is it?

452
00:28:52,047 --> 00:28:56,294
- Daisy Farrdell.
- Conchita, I heard you were here.

453
00:28:56,384 --> 00:28:59,173
Poor Conchita,
I'm sorry for your trouble.

454
00:28:59,262 --> 00:29:02,798
Oh, God, is that himself?

455
00:29:02,891 --> 00:29:04,967
It is. Tell her nothing.

456
00:29:07,103 --> 00:29:10,770
I'm surprised at your mother,
exploiting the poor creature.

457
00:29:10,857 --> 00:29:12,767
What way is she exploiting him?

458
00:29:12,859 --> 00:29:17,486
Making a show of him. Writing books,
profiting from his misfortune.

459
00:29:17,572 --> 00:29:20,574
If it was me,
I'd protect him from all that.

460
00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:24,906
Give him little delicacies,
talk soft to him,

461
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:27,831
bring him into bed in the mornings.

462
00:29:27,916 --> 00:29:30,704
It wouldn't be the first time,
would it?

463
00:29:30,794 --> 00:29:34,293
I was just saying, Conchita,
I'd know him anywhere.

464
00:29:34,381 --> 00:29:35,793
Would you really?

465
00:29:35,882 --> 00:29:38,587
I would.
It's the way he works the shoulders.

466
00:29:38,677 --> 00:29:41,714
The shifty eyes,
the drop on the end of his nose.

467
00:29:41,805 --> 00:29:44,558
It could only be Hubert.
As a matter of fact,

468
00:29:44,641 --> 00:29:47,050
I think in many ways he's improved.

469
00:29:47,143 --> 00:29:49,220
He has more hair for a start.

470
00:29:50,105 --> 00:29:52,560
Come here till I see you, Hubert.

471
00:29:52,649 --> 00:29:56,564
- You can see him well enough.
- Let him out, he's with friends.

a little bit of twist... <i>♪</i>

502
00:32:19,004 --> 00:32:21,412
(Music fades)

503
00:32:27,762 --> 00:32:30,136
(Conchita) Felix?

504
00:32:32,058 --> 00:32:34,847
Well, there's your hero.
Feast your eyes.

505
00:32:34,936 --> 00:32:37,606
- What happened to him?
- You may well ask!

506
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:41,106
- He's all brown.
- That's stout. On his good coat.

507
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:44,063
That won't come out,
you won't shift that.

508
00:32:44,154 --> 00:32:46,064
- The poor thing.
- But how...?

509
00:32:46,156 --> 00:32:48,611
I haven't the strength
to go into it now.

510
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,906
He got out of the cage in Mick's pub

511
00:32:50,994 --> 00:32:54,162
and shot off with meself
and the kids after him.

512
00:32:54,247 --> 00:32:58,494
Me after him! Pius did nothing.
Letting on he wasn't even with us.

513
00:32:58,585 --> 00:33:01,918
- You're very hard on your brother.
- Little shite.

514
00:33:02,005 --> 00:33:04,876
Do you expect a lad
bound for the priesthood

515
00:33:04,966 --> 00:33:09,510
to be seen chasing a drunk rat up
the Quays in full view of the chapel?

516
00:33:09,596 --> 00:33:13,013
- I don't know what way I reared...
- (Phelim) Jesus!

517
00:33:13,099 --> 00:33:16,018
(Phelim) It's all right, Conchita.

518
00:33:16,102 --> 00:33:18,938
(Pius) Ma! Dad, let go of her.

519
00:33:19,022 --> 00:33:21,146
(Phelim) Calm down, Conchita.

520
00:33:25,028 --> 00:33:27,781
(Conchita) Do something! Pius! Pius!

521
00:33:27,864 --> 00:33:30,237
(Phelim) Pius, go easy.

522
00:33:30,325 --> 00:33:35,236
Go easy, Pius.
Will you just stay calm?

523
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:37,371
(Marietta) You're hurting Da!

524
00:33:37,457 --> 00:33:41,040
Stay calm! Stand back!
Hubert, are you gonna let go?

525
00:33:41,127 --> 00:33:44,627
- He's through to the bone!
- This is no way to behave!

526
00:33:45,549 --> 00:33:47,044
Hubert!

527
00:33:47,175 --> 00:33:48,552
Daddy!

528
00:33:52,389 --> 00:33:54,679
You shouldn't have done that, Da.

529
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:57,519
You've put yourself in the wrong now.

530
00:33:57,602 --> 00:34:00,390
Thanks, Felix. Oh, God, me thumb!

531
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,396
You'll want to go to the doctor,
Conchita, and get the jab.

532
00:34:04,484 --> 00:34:08,186
I will, I will, Felix,
when I get my breath.

533
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,444
Marietta, take your father upstairs
and put him in the hot press.

534
00:34:12,534 --> 00:34:14,491
He'd be better in the wardrobe.

535
00:34:14,578 --> 00:34:18,030
- No. I want to make him sweat.
- But he'll be lonely.

536
00:34:18,123 --> 00:34:21,041
Take him before
I do something I might regret.

537
00:34:21,126 --> 00:34:22,621
Come on, Daddy.

538
00:34:24,713 --> 00:34:26,623
Are we going to kill him?

539
00:34:26,715 --> 00:34:28,839
I don't know, Son.

540
00:34:28,925 --> 00:34:32,045
But it's time we settled it
one way or the other.

541
00:34:32,137 --> 00:34:36,384
Tonight, when Matt gets home,
we'll have a family meeting.

542
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:38,930
This time he's gone too far.

543
00:34:53,074 --> 00:34:55,198
It's only to dry you out, Daddy.

544
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:02,661
Look, I'll leave the door open,
in case it gets too warm, OK?

545
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,635
(Clears throat) Nice evening.

546
00:35:17,724 --> 00:35:20,133
Was that your father?

547
00:35:20,227 --> 00:35:23,394
No, that was me Uncle Matt.

548
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,722
Me father's smaller.

549
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:31,110
Why will you not ask me in, Marietta?

550
00:35:31,196 --> 00:35:34,648
Because we're having
a family meeting.

551
00:35:34,741 --> 00:35:36,817
It's to decide me dad's future.

552
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:40,908
You see, he's very fain, me da.
He's gone away to nothing.

553
00:35:42,832 --> 00:35:45,039
Why are you having a meeting?

554
00:35:45,126 --> 00:35:47,831
- Because he bit me mother.
- Oh.

555
00:35:49,256 --> 00:35:51,332
Is he in the habit of biting her?

556
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:54,094
Oh, no.
It was just an isolated incident.

557
00:35:58,181 --> 00:36:00,554
I suppose I'll meet him soon enough.

558
00:36:00,642 --> 00:36:03,845
- Why do you say that?
- Well, at the wedding...

559
00:36:03,937 --> 00:36:06,346
Won't he be there to give you away?

560
00:36:43,852 --> 00:36:46,261
(Conchita) Where's Marietta?

561
00:36:46,354 --> 00:36:48,265
I'm here.

562
00:36:48,356 --> 00:36:50,314
All sit down and we'll get started.

563
00:36:51,193 --> 00:36:54,645
This meeting is to decide
what's to be done with Hubert

564
00:36:54,738 --> 00:36:57,526
following his unprovoked attack.

565
00:36:57,616 --> 00:37:02,575
Everybody will get a chance to speak
and as the youngest, Pius will start.

566
00:37:02,662 --> 00:37:06,613
- Fourth Commandment...
- Listen now, this will be good.

567
00:37:06,708 --> 00:37:09,995
...tells us to honour
our father and our mother.

568
00:37:10,086 --> 00:37:12,756
- And I always did.
- You did, Son.

569
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:17,335
But, on account of me father,
I can no longer fulfil my vocation.

570
00:37:17,427 --> 00:37:19,752
- Why?
- No, Matt, Pius has the floor.

571
00:37:19,846 --> 00:37:21,472
Sorry, Conchita,

572
00:37:21,556 --> 00:37:25,637
but where does it say a man can't be
a priest cos his father's a rat?

573
00:37:25,727 --> 00:37:27,851
It doesn't say it in so many words.

574
00:37:27,938 --> 00:37:31,189
Now that me father's turned
his back on his family...

575
00:37:31,274 --> 00:37:34,727
(Matt) I must take issue,
just because Hubert is now a rat,

576
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:38,023
doesn't mean that he is not
devoted to his family.

577
00:37:38,114 --> 00:37:41,033
It's a well-known fact
that just as we humans

578
00:37:41,117 --> 00:37:43,407
will be faithful to our loved ones,

579
00:37:43,495 --> 00:37:47,113
so the parent rat will be
prepared to lay down his life

580
00:37:47,207 --> 00:37:49,283
for his nearest and dearest.

581
00:37:49,376 --> 00:37:52,460
(Conchita) just tell us, Pius,
like a good boy,

582
00:37:52,546 --> 00:37:55,797
what do you think
we should do with your father?

583
00:37:55,882 --> 00:37:58,373
I think we should
put him in the Aga.

584
00:38:01,304 --> 00:38:03,795
- Do you hear that, Marietta?
- What?

585
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:06,465
Your brother wants to put him
in the Aga.

586
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,434
I don't know. I'm confused.

587
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:12,305
I love Daddy, but I have to think
of me future with Rudolph.

588
00:38:12,399 --> 00:38:14,439
- The geneticals?
- Yeah.

589
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:19,271
It's bad enough to be expecting, but
to not know what you're expecting.

590
00:38:19,364 --> 00:38:21,737
Not that I am expecting,
but if I was.

591
00:38:21,825 --> 00:38:25,906
If it was really Daddy, but it isn't.
It's only a scabby rat.

592
00:38:25,996 --> 00:38:27,906
You want to put him in the Aga?

593
00:38:27,998 --> 00:38:30,204
No. I wouldn't want him to suffer.

594
00:38:30,292 --> 00:38:34,289
I thought maybe something
mild and painless in his food.

595
00:38:34,379 --> 00:38:37,048
Ah, Daddy, don't be looking at me.

596
00:38:37,132 --> 00:38:40,252
Do you see him looking at me?
I didn't mean it.

597
00:38:43,471 --> 00:38:45,548
I vote we leave him as he is.

598
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,808
That's one for and one against.
Your turn, Felix.

599
00:38:48,894 --> 00:38:52,560
Mm, well...naturally,

600
00:38:52,647 --> 00:38:55,186
my chief interest
has to be the book.

601
00:38:55,275 --> 00:39:00,186
And the theme of it is how the family
remain true in the face of adversity,

602
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,531
loyal to the head of the family,
even though he's a rat.

603
00:39:03,617 --> 00:39:06,156
It's hard to reconcile
that and the Aga.

604
00:39:06,244 --> 00:39:10,622
Also, once the book comes out, we'll
want Hubert to do signing sessions.

605
00:39:10,707 --> 00:39:13,661
- To sign the book?
- He'll do it with his foot.

606
00:39:13,752 --> 00:39:17,537
- There'll be other appearances too.
- The Late Late Show.

607
00:39:17,631 --> 00:39:20,834
Wildlife On One.
So, you see, we will need him.

608
00:39:20,926 --> 00:39:25,054
However, when you've seen one rat,
you've seem them all.

609
00:39:25,138 --> 00:39:27,926
(Conchita)
What are you saying, Felix?

610
00:39:28,016 --> 00:39:32,346
I'm saying that one white rat's
very much the same as another.

611
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:35,391
I was down this morning
at Reilly's Rat Shop

612
00:39:35,482 --> 00:39:38,899
and I was shown a fine range
of white rats at £2 a head.

613
00:39:38,985 --> 00:39:42,189
- That's very reasonable.
- Or three for a fiver.

614
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,697
- But it wouldn't be Daddy.
- No. But who would know?

615
00:39:45,784 --> 00:39:48,275
And they would only be
for emergency.

616
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:51,822
- They'd be on the bench.
- What'd we do with Hubert?

617
00:39:51,915 --> 00:39:56,162
Keep him. Whatever he may have
sunk to, Pius, he is your father.

618
00:39:56,253 --> 00:40:00,879
And as the poet says, "You'll never
miss your father till he's gone."

619
00:40:02,634 --> 00:40:06,549
Oh, that was beautiful, Felix.

620
00:40:07,889 --> 00:40:09,799
Thank you, Conchita.

621
00:40:11,518 --> 00:40:16,180
Even after all he's done to me,
I don't think I could kill him.

622
00:40:16,273 --> 00:40:19,357
You're the wise one, Matt.
Tell us what to do.

623
00:40:19,442 --> 00:40:22,017
Well, for a start,
I'd rule out the Aga.

624
00:40:22,112 --> 00:40:26,110
It's very hard to shift the smell
of burnt rat in the kitchen.

625
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:28,524
But we can't keep him round the house

626
00:40:28,618 --> 00:40:32,154
in the capacity of an Au pair rat
biting all and sundry,

627
00:40:32,247 --> 00:40:34,537
spreading disease and droppings.

628
00:40:34,708 --> 00:40:39,003
No, the solution I propose is that
Hubert should be taken out somewhere

629
00:40:39,087 --> 00:40:41,578
where he can be placed
among his own kind

630
00:40:41,673 --> 00:40:45,540
to live out the rest of his days
in peace among his furry friends.

631
00:40:45,635 --> 00:40:49,135
And when death comes, as it does
to us all, he'll either:

632
00:40:49,222 --> 00:40:53,884
number one, turn back into a man and
we'll go for the widow's pension...

633
00:40:53,977 --> 00:40:57,679
number two, he stays a rat
and no remarks need be passed...

634
00:40:57,772 --> 00:41:01,818
or if number three, if he returns
to human form before he passes on,

635
00:41:01,902 --> 00:41:03,563
he can get the bus home.

636
00:41:03,653 --> 00:41:06,940
We could leave a suit
with the bus fare in the pocket.

637
00:41:07,032 --> 00:41:10,899
Good, Felix. Then, if there's no sign
of him after 12 months,

638
00:41:10,994 --> 00:41:13,153
we'll go back to where we left him.

639
00:41:13,246 --> 00:41:16,746
After all, there's no use
being at the loss of the suit.

640
00:41:16,833 --> 00:41:19,455
- Have you thought of a place?
- I have.

641
00:41:19,544 --> 00:41:23,922
(Phelim) Did you have to ask?
Doesn't he think of everything?

642
00:41:24,007 --> 00:41:29,678
(Matt) A man I know, name
of Mulligan, has a premises here...

643
00:41:29,763 --> 00:41:32,432
on the far side of Dunlavin.

644
00:42:07,384 --> 00:42:09,792
Holy God, Matt.
That's a wicked smell.

645
00:42:09,886 --> 00:42:12,295
It's a very pungent odour for us,

646
00:42:12,389 --> 00:42:15,971
but to a rat,
it's like all the perfumes of Arabia.

647
00:42:16,059 --> 00:42:18,515
It's your new home, Hubert.

648
00:42:18,603 --> 00:42:23,147
(Marietta) You can't do it! You can't
leave Da in a maggot factory.

649
00:42:23,233 --> 00:42:26,602
Marietta, think about it
from a rat's point of view,

650
00:42:26,695 --> 00:42:29,399
surrounded by rotten meat
and maggots.

651
00:42:29,489 --> 00:42:31,731
To the rat, it's like holiday camp.

652
00:42:31,825 --> 00:42:33,817
Why did we have to come at night?

653
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:37,576
If they see us bringing rats to
a maggot factory, we'd be locked up.

654
00:42:37,664 --> 00:42:41,710
Now...where will we put him, Matt?

655
00:42:41,793 --> 00:42:43,869
Oh, wait.

656
00:42:45,922 --> 00:42:50,833
In case we come back.
You know, so we'll know him.

657
00:42:55,891 --> 00:42:58,264
Hubert...

658
00:42:58,351 --> 00:43:02,516
who'd have thought it would
ever end like this, hmm?

659
00:43:02,606 --> 00:43:06,438
I'm sorry you have to go,
but you brought it on yourself.

660
00:43:08,111 --> 00:43:10,152
Matt's leaving the brown suit

661
00:43:10,238 --> 00:43:13,192
and the thermal underpants
up by the wall.

662
00:43:14,409 --> 00:43:18,194
And the bus fare's
in the inside pocket.

663
00:43:18,288 --> 00:43:20,862
Now, I want you to know...

664
00:43:20,957 --> 00:43:25,453
if you should come to your senses,
you'll always be welcome home.

665
00:43:25,545 --> 00:43:29,163
And Mr Mooney says the job
will always be waiting.

666
00:43:29,257 --> 00:43:30,799
Conchita.

667
00:43:34,179 --> 00:43:36,219
Have you anything to say?

668
00:43:40,519 --> 00:43:42,345
In that case...

669
00:43:42,437 --> 00:43:44,976
- Good luck, Hubert.
- God bless now.

670
00:43:52,405 --> 00:43:54,150
(Thud)

671
00:43:54,241 --> 00:43:55,699
Goodbye, Daddy.

672
00:44:14,594 --> 00:44:16,551

It's snowing again.

693
00:46:19,928 --> 00:46:23,795
I think of little Hubert
sitting in the maggot factory,

694
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:26,595
not a stitch on him,
the snow falling.

695
00:46:30,021 --> 00:46:35,312
They do say if a budgie escapes,
the wild birds will kill him.

696
00:46:35,402 --> 00:46:40,231
The wild ones don't like the budgies
- jealous of the budgie's beauty.

697
00:46:40,323 --> 00:46:43,325
The beauty of the budgie
has nothing to do with it.

698
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:45,652
That's what will happen to Hubert.

699
00:46:45,745 --> 00:46:49,791
The wild rats will eat him like
the wild birds eat the budgies.

700
00:46:49,875 --> 00:46:53,042
There's no comparison
between a budgie and a rat.

701
00:46:53,128 --> 00:46:55,536
The budgie, Melopsittacus undulatus,

702
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:58,964
is a small, defenceless bird
of Australian origin.

703
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:01,672
The rat is well able to fight
his corner.

704
00:47:01,761 --> 00:47:05,428
The rat's a horse of
a different colour than the budgie.

705
00:47:07,434 --> 00:47:09,391
He could be dead already.

706
00:47:10,645 --> 00:47:12,971
Picked clean by the crows.

707
00:47:17,194 --> 00:47:20,610

There's no point, Conchita.

714
00:47:49,476 --> 00:47:52,015
If he's alive,
he's better where he is.

715
00:47:52,103 --> 00:47:55,390
And if he is dead,
we can do nothing for him.

716
00:47:55,482 --> 00:47:58,650
We can give him a Christian burial.

717
00:47:58,735 --> 00:48:01,654
With a little headstone,

718
00:48:01,738 --> 00:48:03,779
"Here lies Hubert Flynn...

719
00:48:03,865 --> 00:48:06,867
"ate by rats."

720
00:48:06,952 --> 00:48:08,660
Oh, Mammy, stop!

721
00:48:08,745 --> 00:48:10,821
Shh! Listen.

722
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,291
The door!

723
00:48:15,377 --> 00:48:18,046
It's just the carol singers.

724
00:48:18,129 --> 00:48:19,672
No!

725
00:48:19,756 --> 00:48:21,168
(Faint scratching)

726
00:48:25,053 --> 00:48:26,465
(Dog barks)

727
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:30,468
Mickey!

728
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:38,684
- It's Daddy!
- What?

729
00:48:38,775 --> 00:48:40,981
(Conchita) I don't believe it!

730
00:48:41,069 --> 00:48:45,731
And look at the dirt on those feet!
Where were you?

731
00:48:45,824 --> 00:48:47,366
You know where he was.

732
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:50,404
What state is that
to be coming home in?

733
00:48:50,495 --> 00:48:53,070
Look, he brought a friend.

734
00:48:53,164 --> 00:48:57,162
I don't know why you're surprised.
He was always the same.

735
00:48:57,252 --> 00:49:01,796
Bringing home bowsies from the pub,
expecting me to put up a feed.

736
00:49:01,882 --> 00:49:06,129
Tell your friend to shift out of here
or I'll be shifting him.

737
00:49:06,219 --> 00:49:09,553
It appears to me
from the colour and confirmation,

738
00:49:09,639 --> 00:49:12,558
that it's not of the genus
Rattus norvegicus...

739
00:49:12,642 --> 00:49:15,217
- Who cares what sort of rat...
- But is,

740
00:49:15,312 --> 00:49:19,440
a large specimen
of the black rat, Rattus rattus,

741
00:49:19,524 --> 00:49:22,562
which is,
a carrier of the bubonical plague.

742
00:49:22,652 --> 00:49:26,947
- (Conchita) Jesus!
- Marietta, fetch the oven glove.

743
00:49:35,624 --> 00:49:37,748
(Conchita) Careful now, Matt.

744
00:49:40,212 --> 00:49:42,751
- Felix, the window.
- I got it, Matt.

745
00:49:45,425 --> 00:49:48,427
Please, God,
he'll go into Daisy Farrdell.

746
00:49:51,264 --> 00:49:54,218
I don't know
where we'd be without you, Matt.

747
00:49:54,309 --> 00:49:59,102
God knows we've had enough misfortune
without the bubonical plague.

748
00:49:59,189 --> 00:50:01,894
- Where are you going?
- To get Rudolph.

749
00:50:01,983 --> 00:50:06,397
I'm bringing him home to meet Daddy.
I should have done it ages ago.

750
00:50:07,489 --> 00:50:09,565
Imagine the little size of him,

751
00:50:09,658 --> 00:50:13,869
settin' off on a journey 40 miles
over the mountains and valleys,

752
00:50:13,954 --> 00:50:17,786
to be with his loved ones
for Christmas,

753
00:50:17,874 --> 00:50:22,288
through thunder and lightning,
wind and snow, on his little legs.

754
00:50:22,379 --> 00:50:24,752
We should be proud of him.

755
00:50:30,846 --> 00:50:32,756
HE'S gone!

756
00:50:32,848 --> 00:50:34,674
He's left us!

757
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:39,385
Stand back, please.

758
00:50:39,479 --> 00:50:41,555
He came home to die.

759
00:50:41,648 --> 00:50:44,187
The rat is not particular
where he dies.

760
00:50:44,276 --> 00:50:47,064
The animal you have in mind
is the elephant...

761
00:50:47,153 --> 00:50:49,360
Forget the elephant,
what about Hubert?

762
00:50:49,447 --> 00:50:53,066
There is a faint,
but discernible pulse.

763
00:50:53,159 --> 00:50:54,821
What'll we do?

764
00:50:54,911 --> 00:50:57,830
One method
is mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

765
00:50:57,914 --> 00:51:01,165
But the danger in trying
to resuscitate the rat this way

766
00:51:01,251 --> 00:51:05,202
is that he might wake up and bite
you, thus passing on the bubonicals.

767
00:51:05,297 --> 00:51:08,049
Felix, get the doctor.
Pius, the priest.

768
00:51:08,133 --> 00:51:10,921
- Father Geraldo.
- Why not Father Mick?

769
00:51:11,011 --> 00:51:12,672
Father Geraldo.

770
00:51:12,762 --> 00:51:15,384
Father Mick is just as good
at the Last Rites.

771
00:51:15,473 --> 00:51:19,305
- I want more than the Last Rites.
- What more can you get?

772
00:51:19,394 --> 00:51:23,309
Father Geraldo cast the devil
out of the house in Sallynoggin,

773
00:51:23,398 --> 00:51:26,269
I want him to cast the devil
out of your father.

774
00:51:26,359 --> 00:51:28,270
Cos bad and all as he is,

775
00:51:28,361 --> 00:51:32,193
I'd hate to send him
before his maker as a rat.

776
00:51:32,282 --> 00:51:34,275
Go on now, Son.

777
00:51:39,206 --> 00:51:42,041
I'll have to wash him
for the doctor coming.

778
00:51:42,125 --> 00:51:45,079
We don't want to
be letting ourselves down.

779
00:51:56,723 --> 00:51:59,891
Matt, would you ever
go up to the green chest

780
00:51:59,976 --> 00:52:04,022
and look in Pius' Action Man clothes,
there's a little dressing gown.

781
00:52:04,105 --> 00:52:07,309
Right.
You don't think it'll strain him?

782
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,774
Ah, no. I have him on wool.

783
00:52:09,861 --> 00:52:11,273
Oh.

784
00:52:15,742 --> 00:52:17,783
(Clattering)

785
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,801
Ah, thanks, Matt.

786
00:52:48,066 --> 00:52:51,400
Ah! I think it suits him.

787
00:52:55,323 --> 00:52:57,565
(Door closes, alarm beeps)

788
00:53:05,458 --> 00:53:08,294
Would you mind hurrying up, Father?

789
00:53:08,378 --> 00:53:10,205
I am hurrying "P-

790
00:53:10,297 --> 00:53:15,422
Such a time to go rousting me out
on Christmas Eve. ls he that sick?

791
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:18,464
I'll be very annoyed with you
if he isn't.

792
00:53:18,555 --> 00:53:21,972
Nothing vexes me more
than to give a man the Last Rites

793
00:53:22,058 --> 00:53:23,766
and then he doesn't die.

794
00:53:23,852 --> 00:53:27,470
- He's more than just sick, Father.
- What was that?

795
00:53:27,564 --> 00:53:31,016
He might need to
be exercised as well.

796
00:53:31,109 --> 00:53:34,229
God bless us and save us.

797
00:53:34,321 --> 00:53:36,860
Do you mean he's possessed
by the devil?

798
00:53:36,948 --> 00:53:41,528
Isn't it true, Father, that the devil
takes different shapes?

799
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:43,281
Oh, by God, he does.

800
00:53:43,371 --> 00:53:46,491
Then maybe he's possessed
by the devil.

801
00:53:46,583 --> 00:53:49,703
Well, I wish you'd given me
a bit more notice.

802
00:53:51,796 --> 00:53:53,872
I'm not fit, you see.

803
00:53:53,965 --> 00:53:58,876
When you're up against the devil,
you have to be at your peak.

804
00:54:09,314 --> 00:54:11,141
Could you hurry up, Father?

805
00:54:11,233 --> 00:54:13,772
I am hurrying.
Don't be annoying me.

806
00:54:15,946 --> 00:54:19,149
I'm worried in case he dies
with the devil still in him.

807
00:54:19,241 --> 00:54:21,115
Don't be alarmed about that.

808
00:54:21,201 --> 00:54:23,775
If he dies,
the devil won't hang about.

809
00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:26,658
No devil would be
caught dead in a corpse.

810
00:54:30,085 --> 00:54:32,754
You get that. And that.

811
00:54:38,635 --> 00:54:41,126
You're very good to come out, Doctor.

812
00:54:41,221 --> 00:54:43,380
Perfectly all right, Mrs Flynn.

813
00:54:43,473 --> 00:54:45,680
You'll see a great change in him.

814
00:54:45,767 --> 00:54:49,552
I did warn him what'd happen
if he didn't look after himself.

815
00:54:49,646 --> 00:54:52,517
He'd heed no one, Doctor.
You know yourself.

816
00:55:04,911 --> 00:55:08,328
- There's a rat in the bed.
- I know.

817
00:55:08,415 --> 00:55:10,823
In a camel hair dressing gown.

818
00:55:10,917 --> 00:55:13,326
That's Hubert.

819
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:14,832
Ah.

820
00:55:31,271 --> 00:55:34,522
Well, Mr Flynn,
if I might just loosen your robe.

821
00:55:44,492 --> 00:55:46,818
Having a quiet Christmas, are we?

822
00:55:46,912 --> 00:55:49,996
Ah, very quiet, Doctor.
just the family.

823
00:55:50,081 --> 00:55:54,293
Mm-hmm. Much the best,
our loved ones around us.

824
00:55:55,754 --> 00:55:59,621
Hmm. All clear there.

825
00:56:10,227 --> 00:56:14,355
Doctor, as a matter of interest,
would you prefer a turkey or a goose?

826
00:56:14,439 --> 00:56:17,060
Goose, I think.

827
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:19,475
I think the goose is very greasy.

828
00:56:19,569 --> 00:56:24,398
(Matt) You want the grease to line
the stomach. The turkey is too dry.

829
00:56:27,744 --> 00:56:30,117
We're going to have a duck.

830
00:56:31,456 --> 00:56:33,698
(Hissing)

831
00:56:35,627 --> 00:56:37,952
<i>Hmm.</i>

832
00:56:38,046 --> 00:56:41,000
Perhaps a little high.
Nothing alarming.

833
00:56:42,133 --> 00:56:44,340
(Matt) Not much eating on a duck.

834
00:56:44,427 --> 00:56:47,844
I just as soon have a pork chop.

835
00:56:47,931 --> 00:56:51,430
I like a pork chop,
particularly with a kidney in it.

836
00:56:51,518 --> 00:56:54,306
Would you believe
I can't face the kidney?

837
00:56:57,524 --> 00:57:00,098
Now...Mr Flynn.

838
00:57:00,193 --> 00:57:01,985
(Marietta) Mammy?

839
00:57:07,075 --> 00:57:09,281
- Ma?
- What's all the shouting?

840
00:57:09,369 --> 00:57:11,410
Your father's sick in the bed.

841
00:57:11,496 --> 00:57:14,331
- Oh, is he all right?
- He's the same as he was.

842
00:57:14,416 --> 00:57:18,082
If you think that's all right or not
is up to yourself.

843
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:22,298
Oh, Rudolph, this is Mammy.
Mammy, this is Rudolph.

844
00:57:22,382 --> 00:57:26,463
How do you do? We've heard so much
about you. You're very welcome.

845
00:57:26,553 --> 00:57:30,420
Merry Christmas, Mrs Flynn.
Where was it he bit you then?

846
00:57:30,515 --> 00:57:33,303
- We want to see Daddy.
- Are you sure?

847
00:57:33,393 --> 00:57:35,469
Thanks very much, Doctor.

848
00:57:37,439 --> 00:57:39,894
- Well, thanks again.
- Oh.

849
00:57:39,983 --> 00:57:42,854
I'm afraid he is a little low.

850
00:57:42,944 --> 00:57:47,358
I don't care how low he is, that was
no place to stick your thermometer.

851
00:57:47,449 --> 00:57:52,159
Well, he doesn't have a proper tongue
or an armpit, come to that.

852
00:57:52,245 --> 00:57:54,618
He undertook a journey of 40 miles?

853
00:57:54,706 --> 00:57:57,541
Through ice and snow,
and thunder and rain.

854
00:57:57,626 --> 00:58:00,295
Plucky fellow,
obviously got his feet wet.

855
00:58:00,378 --> 00:58:03,131
And with four feet,
it's twice as dangerous.

856
00:58:03,215 --> 00:58:05,919
Now, the temperature.
It must come down.

857
00:58:06,009 --> 00:58:08,583
Say no more.
Thanks again for coming out.

858
00:58:08,678 --> 00:58:11,798
- Not at all.
- You're very good.

859
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:13,800
He's very small.

860
00:58:13,892 --> 00:58:16,347
Yeah, well, you see, he's been sick.

861
00:58:18,939 --> 00:58:22,889
Did no one offer you tea?
You must think us peculiar people.

862
00:58:22,984 --> 00:58:24,443
No, you're grand.

863
00:58:24,528 --> 00:58:28,063
Put on the kettle, Marietta,
while I get your father.

864
00:58:35,872 --> 00:58:38,494
- Right.
- What are you doing with him?

865
00:58:38,583 --> 00:58:41,537
I'm putting him in the fridge
to cool him down.

866
00:58:41,628 --> 00:58:44,249
Poor little thing.
Here, let me do it.

867
00:58:46,842 --> 00:58:50,211
- Will I put cling wrap on him?
- Put him in as he is.

868
00:58:50,303 --> 00:58:54,717
His fur is damp. It'll freeze
into little spikes, like a hedgehog.

869
00:58:54,808 --> 00:58:57,216
Just put him in. Next to the rashers.

870
00:58:57,310 --> 00:59:00,264
This way, Father.

871
00:59:00,355 --> 00:59:02,728
God save all here.

872
00:59:02,816 --> 00:59:06,517
- How are you, Father?
- We're grateful to you, Father.

873
00:59:06,611 --> 00:59:09,150
Through ice and snow, thunder and...

874
00:59:09,239 --> 00:59:12,775
Now, this is my gear
for giving out the Last Rites.

875
00:59:12,868 --> 00:59:16,119
And this here is my gear
for driving out devils.

876
00:59:16,204 --> 00:59:19,989
- Now, which do you want first?
- Does it matter, Father?

877
00:59:20,083 --> 00:59:23,749
Woman, do you not know
that the devil never goes quietly?

878
00:59:23,837 --> 00:59:27,883
If I cast the devil out first,
the shock could kill your husband

879
00:59:27,966 --> 00:59:30,090
before I give him the Last Rites.

880
00:59:30,177 --> 00:59:32,798
But if I give him
the Last Rites first,

881
00:59:32,888 --> 00:59:37,550
then the devil gets the Last Rites
too, and he's not entitled to them!

882
00:59:37,642 --> 00:59:40,312
It could cause
terrible trouble later.

883
00:59:40,395 --> 00:59:43,598
What would you advise
yourself, Father?

884
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:46,893
I suppose we'll go
for the devil first.

885
00:59:46,985 --> 00:59:48,776
Now, where is he?

886
00:59:48,862 --> 00:59:52,480
Where are you, you mongrel worm?

887
00:59:52,574 --> 00:59:56,359
He's in the fridge, Father.

888
00:59:56,453 --> 00:59:58,529
Oh, be the hokey, ma'am,

889
00:59:58,622 --> 01:00:02,407
that's a very dangerous place
to put a devil.

890
01:00:02,501 --> 01:00:05,371
He could make a complete
dog's dinner of your fridge.

891
01:00:05,462 --> 01:00:10,421
As a matter of fact,
he could fuse the whole house.

892
01:00:14,262 --> 01:00:16,837
Now, all stand back
against the wall.

893
01:00:16,932 --> 01:00:19,173
Come on, Marietta. Come on.

894
01:00:19,267 --> 01:00:22,470
- Now, put out the light.
- (Phelim) I'll do it.

895
01:00:24,981 --> 01:00:30,024
If you have rosary beads,
hang on tight to them.

896
01:00:30,111 --> 01:00:34,940
Keep your eyes closed,
because when you put out a devil,

897
01:00:35,033 --> 01:00:40,158
he has this dirty habit of taking
the sight from your eyes.

898
01:00:42,707 --> 01:00:46,753
I'm coming for you, you black devil.

899
01:00:46,837 --> 01:00:52,460
Do you hear me?
Coming for you, you scarlet whore.

900
01:00:52,551 --> 01:00:57,462
I'm coming to cast you out,
you Babylonian bastard!

901
01:00:57,556 --> 01:01:01,553
Back into the festering
stench and mucus

902
01:01:01,643 --> 01:01:04,348
of the deepest pit of hell!

903
01:01:04,437 --> 01:01:06,811
(♪ Carmina Burana)

904
01:01:26,543 --> 01:01:30,079
Brrr! That's a cold one, Father.

905
01:01:32,132 --> 01:01:34,374
Daddy?

906
01:01:34,467 --> 01:01:37,042
I'm very pleased to meet you,
Mr Flynn.

907
01:01:40,557 --> 01:01:42,597
Oh, Jesus.

908
01:01:42,684 --> 01:01:46,896
Hubert Flynn, come back here with
that duck and explain yourself!

909
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:50,148
What do you mean jumping naked
out of the fridge?

910
01:01:50,233 --> 01:01:52,060
Daddy, you're back!

911
01:01:52,152 --> 01:01:56,150
(Conchita) It wouldn't occur
to you to bring home the suit...

912
01:01:58,909 --> 01:02:02,741
- That was a funny devil.
- That was me father.

913
01:02:02,829 --> 01:02:06,365
You must be chuffed having
him back as well, hey?

918
01:02:25,393 --> 01:02:27,304
What way is your tie?

919
01:02:27,395 --> 01:02:31,477
Er, I'm all thumbs.
A rat don't have thumbs.

920
01:02:31,566 --> 01:02:34,141
It won't be long coming back to you.

921
01:02:34,236 --> 01:02:36,062
No.

922
01:02:36,154 --> 01:02:40,105
Here's your breakfast.
And look, your little red ribbon.

923
01:02:41,201 --> 01:02:43,028
Thanks, love.

924
01:02:45,413 --> 01:02:47,655
What was it like to be a rat, Daddy?

925
01:02:47,749 --> 01:02:50,288
Did you know
what had happened to you?

926
01:02:50,377 --> 01:02:52,334
No, not straight off, no.

927
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:54,829
The brain of the rat is very small.

928
01:02:54,923 --> 01:02:58,375
- What did you miss most?
- Ah, I missed the fags.

929
01:02:58,468 --> 01:03:00,260
Ah, if I'd only known,

930
01:03:00,345 --> 01:03:03,429
I'd have rolled up fags
and lit them for you.

931
01:03:04,850 --> 01:03:07,934
Thanks. No, there was compensations.

932
01:03:08,019 --> 01:03:11,306
- Like, I could see in the dark.
- Really?

933
01:03:11,398 --> 01:03:14,934
- I knew when it was going to rain.
- Go away.

934
01:03:15,026 --> 01:03:18,942
The only thing I never got used to
was how people looked at you.

935
01:03:19,030 --> 01:03:21,071
Like they were swallowing a lemon.

936
01:03:22,826 --> 01:03:24,818
Do you remember biting Mammy?

937
01:03:24,911 --> 01:03:28,660
I do. Did you ever taste blood?

938
01:03:28,748 --> 01:03:32,035
- No.
- Like Yorkshire Relish.

939
01:03:32,127 --> 01:03:36,789
- (Conchita) Breakfast!
- On you go. I have to shave yet.

940
01:03:36,882 --> 01:03:40,215
It's me first shave
since Hallowe'en.

941
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:44,425
It's on the table.

942
01:03:47,184 --> 01:03:49,224
Happy Christmas, Conchita.

943
01:03:49,311 --> 01:03:52,099
Felix, you shouldn't... Oh!

944
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:57,642
- Do youse mind?
- Sit down and have your breakfast.

945
01:03:59,446 --> 01:04:03,361
Pardon me saying it, Felix,
but you're a little bit shook.

946
01:04:03,450 --> 01:04:07,448
- I never closed me eyes.
- Poor old Felix put out of your bed.

947
01:04:07,537 --> 01:04:11,369
- It's Da's bed. He's a right to it.
- He's no right at all.

948
01:04:11,458 --> 01:04:13,534
Driving Felix out to the couch.

949
01:04:13,627 --> 01:04:16,166
It wasn't the couch.
I couldn't sleep

950
01:04:16,254 --> 01:04:19,339
with all the tempestuous thoughts
in me mind.

951
01:04:19,424 --> 01:04:21,381
What tempestuous thoughts?

952
01:04:21,468 --> 01:04:23,710
- About the book.
- The book?

953
01:04:23,803 --> 01:04:26,295
- I thought it was finished.
- It was.

954
01:04:26,389 --> 01:04:28,513
After last night,
it's all changed.

955
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:31,851
Didn't it give you the climax
any author would want,

956
01:04:31,937 --> 01:04:34,428
with Hubert leaping out
of the fridge?

957
01:04:34,523 --> 01:04:37,062
But who'll believe us?

958
01:04:37,150 --> 01:04:40,401
We write a book about a man
who turns into a rat.

959
01:04:40,487 --> 01:04:43,571
We tell the whole story
and on the eve of publication,

960
01:04:43,657 --> 01:04:45,365
he turns back into a man?

961
01:04:45,450 --> 01:04:48,285
How can we prove
that he was anything else?

962
01:04:48,370 --> 01:04:51,621
Haven't we Father Geraldo
as a witness?

963
01:04:51,706 --> 01:04:54,411
It's well-known
the Father isn't all there.

964
01:04:54,501 --> 01:04:57,206
And he never actually
looked in the fridge.

965
01:04:57,295 --> 01:05:00,463
For all he knew,
we had Da in there all the time.

966
01:05:00,549 --> 01:05:02,625
The doctor! The doctor seen him.

967
01:05:02,717 --> 01:05:04,592
The doctor only seen a rat.

968
01:05:04,678 --> 01:05:06,837
He'd only our word it was Hubert.

969
01:05:08,557 --> 01:05:10,514
I'm afraid Felix has a point.

970
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:14,646
It appears that Hubert
has returned prematurely.

971
01:05:14,729 --> 01:05:18,561
- Happy Christmas.
- What do you mean, happy Christmas?

972
01:05:18,650 --> 01:05:21,271
Do you not know
you're thwarting us again?

973
01:05:21,361 --> 01:05:25,312
It's not his fault.
Come here, Daddy. Don't mind her.

974
01:05:28,118 --> 01:05:30,609
What was wrong
with the maggot factory?

975
01:05:30,704 --> 01:05:34,785
All the trouble we went to to find
a place a rat would call home.

976
01:05:34,875 --> 01:05:37,793
To think I stopped them
putting you in the Aga.

977
01:05:37,878 --> 01:05:40,251
- I have a plan.
- What plan, Felix?

978
01:05:40,338 --> 01:05:44,087
First of all, we're now
in a highly dangerous situation.

979
01:05:44,176 --> 01:05:47,758
If anybody outside here
gets sight or sound of Hubert,

980
01:05:47,888 --> 01:05:50,213
the book is banjaxed, right?

981
01:05:50,307 --> 01:05:51,718
(All) Right.

982
01:05:51,808 --> 01:05:54,846
So, the sooner we launch the book,
the better.

983
01:05:54,936 --> 01:05:58,685
Are you listening?
We're doing this for you, you know?

984
01:05:58,773 --> 01:06:01,941
And I propose St Valentine's Day.

985
01:06:02,027 --> 01:06:04,518
He was beheaded by Claudius
on April 14th."

986
01:06:04,613 --> 01:06:07,365
Right, St Valentine's Day.
But until then,

987
01:06:07,449 --> 01:06:10,486
Hubert is to be kept
totally incommunicado.

988
01:06:10,577 --> 01:06:12,452
(All) All right, OK.

989
01:06:12,537 --> 01:06:17,876
So, Hubert, you'll be locked
in your room for the next six weeks.

990
01:06:17,959 --> 01:06:21,625
Your meals will be brought in to you
and two bottles of stout a day.

991
01:06:21,713 --> 01:06:23,919
Marietta can take your bets.

992
01:06:24,007 --> 01:06:26,048
You'll need a TV to watch the racing.

993
01:06:26,134 --> 01:06:29,385
- Black and white will do.
- How will he exercise?

994
01:06:29,471 --> 01:06:33,967
He can jump up and down! Pius,
get a hammer and a mouthful of nails.

995
01:06:34,059 --> 01:06:36,265
Go to your room,
fish fingers at 1:00.

996
01:06:36,353 --> 01:06:38,892
Have we no turkey?

997
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:42,148
We have a duck.
But you can't feed six off a duck,

998
01:06:42,234 --> 01:06:44,986
especially after
the mullocking it took.

999
01:06:45,070 --> 01:06:46,778
- He can have mine.
- No!

1000
01:06:46,863 --> 01:06:50,612
He has to learn you can't walk in
off the street demanding duck.

1001
01:06:52,994 --> 01:06:56,198
We'll go into the parlour
and open the presents.

1002
01:07:01,378 --> 01:07:06,123
- There's nothing for you, Daddy.
- Oh, sure. I've nothing for anybody.

1003
01:07:06,216 --> 01:07:08,340
Hubert, go to your room.

1004
01:07:15,642 --> 01:07:17,552
Don't mind him, Daddy.

1005
01:07:19,271 --> 01:07:22,308
Tell us about the maggot factory.
Was it awful?

1006
01:07:22,399 --> 01:07:25,566
No, no. It was sort of like...

1007
01:07:25,652 --> 01:07:28,191
an international rat camp.

1008
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:30,486
There was black and brown rats...

1009
01:07:30,574 --> 01:07:33,278
singing rats from Mexico...
jumping rats from Borneo...

1010
01:07:33,368 --> 01:07:36,156
- Scaly-tailed squirrels.
- Squirrels?

1011
01:07:36,246 --> 01:07:38,121
Yeah. Squirrels is rats too.

1012
01:07:38,206 --> 01:07:40,579
Were they not all the time fightin'?

1013
01:07:40,667 --> 01:07:42,660
No, it's people that fight.

1014
01:07:42,752 --> 01:07:45,706
Oh, no, rats is very peaceful.

1015
01:07:45,797 --> 01:07:49,713
And like, they do you
a good turn if they can.

1016
01:07:49,801 --> 01:07:51,676
And look.

1017
01:07:53,013 --> 01:07:55,172
Is that the one that came with you?

1018
01:07:55,265 --> 01:07:58,468
- The one Uncle threw in the garden?
- Uh-huh.

1019
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:01,134
Her name's Benazir.

1020
01:08:01,229 --> 01:08:04,765
She's a bandicoot rat from Colombo.

1021
01:08:04,858 --> 01:08:07,776
I brought her in out of the cold
this morning.

1022
01:08:07,861 --> 01:08:12,072
I met her on me first night there.
We hit if off straightaway.

1023
01:08:12,157 --> 01:08:14,778
I think I like the black rats
best of all.

1024
01:08:14,868 --> 01:08:18,653
- They have a great sense of rhythm.
- She was your friend?

1025
01:08:18,747 --> 01:08:22,495
She walked by me side all the way
from Dunlavin to Dublin.

1026
01:08:22,584 --> 01:08:25,253
Then waited for me
out there all night.

1027
01:08:25,337 --> 01:08:28,374
- There's loyalty.
- (Hammering)

1028
01:08:28,465 --> 01:08:31,668
(Conchita) Pius! It's time for Mass.

1029
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:33,717
The little shite!

1030
01:08:41,937 --> 01:08:45,270
Conchita, you're looking radiant.

1031
01:08:45,357 --> 01:08:46,934
Thanks.

1032
01:08:51,696 --> 01:08:54,318
This Felix...
what do you think of him?

1033
01:08:54,407 --> 01:08:58,192
I don't know. He spends a lot of time
in the toilet.

1034
01:08:58,286 --> 01:09:00,528
I don't trust him.

1035
01:09:00,622 --> 01:09:04,407
Mammy does.
He has her under his thumb.

1036
01:09:06,586 --> 01:09:11,462
From the asses and the oxen
in that lowly stable,

1037
01:09:11,550 --> 01:09:14,967
indeed, from all of God's creatures,

1038
01:09:15,053 --> 01:09:18,387
we have much to learn.

1039
01:09:18,473 --> 01:09:22,638
Little sister cow,
who gives us her milk.

1040
01:09:22,727 --> 01:09:25,480
Little hen,
who gives us her daily eggs.

1041
01:09:25,564 --> 01:09:29,230
We have the bugger locked up now
but we can't do it forever.

1042
01:09:29,317 --> 01:09:33,564
True, but there are things we can do,
like stage a re-enactment.

1043
01:09:33,655 --> 01:09:35,945
- A what?
- (Priest clears throat)

1044
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:42,946
Pairs of socks, clothes pegs,

1045
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:46,373
toothpaste, underpants...

1046
01:09:46,459 --> 01:09:50,161
- Go on, Felix.
- We put another rat in the fridge,

1047
01:09:50,255 --> 01:09:52,664
and get Father Geraldo
to do his trick.

1048
01:09:52,757 --> 01:09:56,542
Put a false back in the fridge,
a hole in the wall for Hubert.

1049
01:09:56,636 --> 01:10:00,504
He changes places with the rat
and leaps out when required.

1050
01:10:00,599 --> 01:10:02,141
You're a genius!

1051
01:10:02,225 --> 01:10:06,472
During Hubert's incarceration,
we'll need a supply of rats.

1052
01:10:06,563 --> 01:10:10,062
So, I suggest we visit
Reilly's Rat Shop tomorrow.

1053
01:10:10,150 --> 01:10:13,104
What would we do without you, Felix?

1054
01:10:13,195 --> 01:10:16,861
Let us all join our voices,

1055
01:10:16,948 --> 01:10:20,317
all of us except
that ignorant crowd of shaggers

1056
01:10:20,410 --> 01:10:23,993
carrying on
and canoodling down the back.

1057
01:10:26,666 --> 01:10:30,451
Don't make me have to go down to you.
Because if I hit you,

1058
01:10:30,545 --> 01:10:32,870
you'll die bouncing!

1059
01:10:36,843 --> 01:10:40,759
So, let us stand and join our voices

1060
01:10:40,847 --> 01:10:46,305
in the carol,
Love Came Down At Christmas.

1061
01:10:46,394 --> 01:10:48,435
(Organ starts)

1062
01:10:54,945 --> 01:10:56,902
(Phelim) There it is.

1063
01:11:04,788 --> 01:11:06,947
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye now.

1064
01:11:09,417 --> 01:11:11,244
Good morning, Mr Reilly.

1065
01:11:11,336 --> 01:11:13,163
- Mr Reilly, is it?
- Mmm.

1066
01:11:13,255 --> 01:11:16,458
- We want a pair of white rats.
- To breed, is it?

1067
01:11:16,550 --> 01:11:19,836
No, we have a little one at home
and he does be lonely.

1068
01:11:19,928 --> 01:11:24,342
Ah, very sociable creatures, rats.
We've a good stock at the moment.

1069
01:11:24,432 --> 01:11:27,885
Always the same on Stephen's Day -
unwanted gifts.

1070
01:11:27,978 --> 01:11:30,018
- Really?
- Ah, yes.

1071
01:11:30,105 --> 01:11:33,142
There's nothing as sad
as an abandoned rat.

1072
01:11:33,233 --> 01:11:37,279
A plum pudding is for Christmas,
but a rat is for life.

1073
01:11:37,362 --> 01:11:39,319
(Knocking)

1074
01:11:39,406 --> 01:11:42,775
I need to go to the toilet.

1075
01:11:42,868 --> 01:11:48,028
(Hubert) Hello! Can anybody hear me?

1076
01:11:51,209 --> 01:11:52,954
Please!

1077
01:11:53,044 --> 01:11:55,749
I need to go to the toilet.

1078
01:12:01,761 --> 01:12:03,837
(Knocking continues)

1079
01:12:03,930 --> 01:12:05,887
Would you give over?

1080
01:12:05,974 --> 01:12:08,643
I need to go to the toilet.

1081
01:12:08,727 --> 01:12:12,013
Can you not hold it in
like any normal man?

1082
01:12:12,105 --> 01:12:14,146
No, I can't.

1083
01:12:15,817 --> 01:12:18,486
Now, hurry up.

1084
01:12:18,570 --> 01:12:22,272
- Not a peep out of you now.
- (Knock at door)

1085
01:12:22,365 --> 01:12:27,111
Oh, Jesus! Matt, put one rat
in the cage and hide the other one.

1086
01:12:35,378 --> 01:12:37,205
- Well?
- Where is he?

1087
01:12:37,297 --> 01:12:40,216
- If you mean Hu...
- Where are you hiding him?

1088
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:42,341
How dare you intrude on our grief!

1089
01:12:42,427 --> 01:12:44,633
Didn't I hear him with me own ears?

1090
01:12:44,721 --> 01:12:47,342
Shouting in agony,
probably chained up.

1091
01:12:47,432 --> 01:12:49,923
If you don't produce him
this instant,

1092
01:12:50,018 --> 01:12:53,138
- I'll have you charged with cruelty.
- Right.

1093
01:12:53,230 --> 01:12:56,812
You want to see Hubert,
I'll show you Hubert.

1094
01:12:56,900 --> 01:13:00,685
Felix, this lady wants to see Hubert.

1095
01:13:00,779 --> 01:13:02,771
No sweat.

1096
01:13:02,864 --> 01:13:04,406
That is not Hubert.

1097
01:13:04,491 --> 01:13:08,537
- Hubert has a drip on his nose.
- He hasn't always got a drip.

1098
01:13:08,620 --> 01:13:10,945
I heard him shouting for the toilet.

1099
01:13:11,039 --> 01:13:13,874
If that's not cruelty,
I don't know what is.

1100
01:13:13,959 --> 01:13:17,660
If it's cruel treatment you want,
I'll give it to you!

1101
01:13:20,715 --> 01:13:23,551
(Arguing continues)

1102
01:14:06,887 --> 01:14:10,090
I'm not letting you away with it.
I'll be back.

1103
01:14:10,182 --> 01:14:12,423
Go on, you wagon, yer.

1104
01:14:12,517 --> 01:14:15,187
Didn't I tell you not
to leave your father?

1105
01:14:15,270 --> 01:14:18,557
- He was asleep.
- You have us destroyed now.

1106
01:14:21,568 --> 01:14:23,727
- Are you finished?
- Yeah.

1107
01:14:26,865 --> 01:14:30,116
Do you see the row
you're after causing now?

1108
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:37,664
- He can't stay here.
- Who can't?

1109
01:14:37,751 --> 01:14:41,962
Your father has to go. Daisy'll blow
the whole thing wide open.

1110
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:45,333
We should've put him in the Aga.
He's too big now.

1111
01:14:45,425 --> 01:14:47,585
We could hide him in the bread van?

1112
01:14:47,677 --> 01:14:51,462
- No, we'd be seen taking his grub.
- Send him to the Canaries!

1113
01:14:51,556 --> 01:14:53,680
Half Kimmage will be there now!

1114
01:14:53,767 --> 01:14:57,515
- He's grown very dishonest.
- I don't believe this!

1115
01:14:57,604 --> 01:15:02,349
You don't care about Daddy. I can
understand Pius, he's a little shite.

1116
01:15:02,442 --> 01:15:04,435
But you, Mammy, and Uncle Matt.

1117
01:15:04,528 --> 01:15:08,692
All you think about is that book.
You never think of poor Daddy!

1118
01:15:08,782 --> 01:15:12,483
I know you're fond of your father,
but think this through.

1119
01:15:12,577 --> 01:15:15,116
When the book comes out,
he'll be famous.

1120
01:15:15,205 --> 01:15:18,906
- Films, documentaries...
- Meetings in the Vatican.

1121
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:23,710
If we want that, we'll have to send
him away until the book comes out.

1122
01:15:23,797 --> 01:15:26,039
(Conchita) Where will we send him?

1123
01:15:26,132 --> 01:15:28,541
Let's commit him to a lunatic asylum.

1124
01:15:28,635 --> 01:15:31,256
- Now you're talking!
- (Marietta) No!

1125
01:15:31,346 --> 01:15:33,671
That's the best idea. I'll tell him.

1126
01:15:33,765 --> 01:15:35,722
Uncle Matt, don't let her!

1127
01:15:35,809 --> 01:15:39,890
Just until the book comes out.
Felix has it all planned.

1128
01:15:39,980 --> 01:15:43,646
Why do we do what Felix says?
He's got Mammy's head turned.

1129
01:15:43,733 --> 01:15:47,815
- Now he wants to put Da in a home!
- He's far better off in a home.

1130
01:15:47,904 --> 01:15:50,609
You must appreciate
that turning into a rat

1131
01:15:50,699 --> 01:15:55,195
causes contraction of muscles and
blockage of the neuroleptical tubes.

1132
01:15:55,287 --> 01:15:59,451
What Hubert needs is a period
of rest in a little padded room.

1133
01:15:59,541 --> 01:16:03,587
He needs the love of his family.
That's what he's going to get.

1134
01:16:03,670 --> 01:16:05,248
Marietta!

1135
01:16:05,338 --> 01:16:07,213
(Knocking)

1136
01:16:08,258 --> 01:16:09,255
What now?

1137
01:16:10,135 --> 01:16:13,421
- (Knocking continues)
- Yeah, coming.

1138
01:16:15,515 --> 01:16:17,757
Is this the home of Conchita Flynn?

1139
01:16:17,851 --> 01:16:20,520
- We've had a complaint...
- (Door closes)

1140
01:16:20,604 --> 01:16:23,095
"that Hubert Flynn
is being imprisoned

1141
01:16:23,190 --> 01:16:28,184
against his will in contravention
of section 15, subsection one of...

1142
01:16:28,278 --> 01:16:30,271
(Marietta screams)

1143
01:16:31,323 --> 01:16:33,233
What's happened?

1144
01:16:33,325 --> 01:16:36,195
- He's gone!
- He's done it again.

1145
01:16:36,286 --> 01:16:39,288
- He's done it again.
- (Marietta screams)

1146
01:16:39,372 --> 01:16:41,247
- The geraniums.
- What?

1147
01:16:41,333 --> 01:16:42,875
Droppings.

1148
01:16:44,377 --> 01:16:48,079
Marietta,
will you try and control yourself?

1149
01:16:48,173 --> 01:16:50,130
- It's a letter.
- Let's see.

1150
01:16:50,217 --> 01:16:52,886
- It's addressed to me.
- Read it, love.

1151
01:16:52,969 --> 01:16:55,378
"My dear daughter,

1152
01:16:55,472 --> 01:16:58,924
"all day long
I've had this strange feeling,

1153
01:16:59,017 --> 01:17:01,686
"the same feeling I had before

1154
01:17:01,770 --> 01:17:04,475
"the day I became a rat.

1155
01:17:04,564 --> 01:17:07,435
"Any minute now,
I could be a rat again..."

1156
01:17:07,526 --> 01:17:11,571
(Hubert) '..put a few things
on paper while I have me thumbs.'

1157
01:17:11,655 --> 01:17:15,440
- Why are you talking funny?
- I'm doing Daddy's voice.

1158
01:17:15,534 --> 01:17:19,282
(Hubert) 'It's a mystery how
it happened the first time.

1159
01:17:19,371 --> 01:17:22,455
'There was full moon that night.
Maybe it was that.

1160
01:17:22,541 --> 01:17:26,538
'I was bit by a rat once in a bakery.
That could have done it.

1161
01:17:26,628 --> 01:17:31,338
'Anyway, by the time you read this,
I'll be on my way back to Dunlavin.

1162
01:17:31,424 --> 01:17:35,422
'You're not to worry about me
in the maggot factory because,

1163
01:17:35,512 --> 01:17:39,130
'as Matt says, "It has everything
a rat could desire."

1164
01:17:40,934 --> 01:17:45,929
'I... I can feel me back arching now.

1165
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:51,484
'Me legs and arms shrinking...

1166
01:17:51,570 --> 01:17:56,612
'and the weight coming forward
into me head and shoulders,

1167
01:17:56,700 --> 01:18:00,033
'bearing me down towards the ground.

1168
01:18:01,454 --> 01:18:05,239
'I have just time...

1169
01:18:05,333 --> 01:18:09,379
'to wish you, Marietta,

1170
01:18:09,462 --> 01:18:13,508
'and your poor mother...a loving...'

1171
01:18:13,592 --> 01:18:18,052
And then look,
it's just a wavy line.

1172
01:18:20,932 --> 01:18:23,637
- May I examine this?
- Where's Conchita?

1173
01:18:23,727 --> 01:18:26,978
- She must've gone after him.
- (Barking)

1174
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:32,688
- (Marietta) Look!
- After him! Don't let him get away.

1175
01:18:32,777 --> 01:18:36,194
- (Marietta) Where did he go?
- He's gone outside.

1176
01:18:38,658 --> 01:18:40,070
Split up.

1177
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:42,865
If you see him,
throw your coat over him.

1178
01:18:47,292 --> 01:18:50,744
This is Sergeant Black
reporting back,

1179
01:18:50,837 --> 01:18:55,499
Mick, would you look up the number
of the Dunlavin Garda station?

1180
01:18:55,592 --> 01:18:57,419
Come on, Mickey.

1181
01:18:59,429 --> 01:19:04,009
Uh, Miss Flynn...would you have
a recent photograph of your father?

1182
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:05,927
Yeah.

1183
01:19:11,191 --> 01:19:13,101
Are you there, Hubert?

1184
01:19:13,193 --> 01:19:16,444
This is Sergeant Black, Kimmage.
Oh, how are you, Pascal?

1185
01:19:16,530 --> 01:19:19,733
I want you to be on the lookout
for a Hubert Flynn,

1186
01:19:19,824 --> 01:19:24,700
53-year-old white male, believed
to be heading your direction.

1187
01:19:24,788 --> 01:19:27,409
Description...

1188
01:19:27,499 --> 01:19:30,334
short, nervous disposition...

1189
01:19:31,461 --> 01:19:32,790
whiskers.

1190
01:19:34,881 --> 01:19:37,041
Come to me, Daddy.

1191
01:19:37,133 --> 01:19:40,004
I won't harm you.

1192
01:19:44,349 --> 01:19:48,015
(Marietta)
Look! He's found something.

1193
01:19:48,103 --> 01:19:50,677
Mr Flynn, if you come out,

1194
01:19:50,772 --> 01:19:53,892
I've got a nice bit
of cheese for you.

1195
01:19:57,612 --> 01:20:01,610
Hubert, if you're in there, come out.

1196
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:03,610
You'll get your death.

1197
01:20:07,414 --> 01:20:10,665
It's a bit of a wild goose chase,
Felix.

1198
01:20:10,750 --> 01:20:14,832
Hello, this is Sergeant Black.
We're coming back.

1199
01:20:14,921 --> 01:20:18,539
- No sign?
- Not even Mam or Da.

1200
01:20:18,633 --> 01:20:21,552
- Nothing. He's long gone.
- Look here!

1201
01:20:21,636 --> 01:20:25,967
Is this what you're looking for?

1202
01:20:26,057 --> 01:20:28,810
- Hand over that rat.
- You can have him.

1203
01:20:28,894 --> 01:20:32,097
Because I don't believe
it's him at all.

1204
01:20:32,189 --> 01:20:36,056
- You're a wicked old wagon.
- Don't sink to her level.

1205
01:20:36,151 --> 01:20:39,484
I think you still
have him locked up...or worse.

1206
01:20:39,571 --> 01:20:41,279
(Car starts)

1207
01:20:41,364 --> 01:20:44,651
Did you look under
the floorboards, Sergeant?

1208
01:20:48,622 --> 01:20:50,995
This time it's the fiery furnace.

1209
01:20:51,082 --> 01:20:52,909
Uncle Matt, don't let him.

1210
01:20:53,001 --> 01:20:55,042
(Matt) We have to discuss this.

1211
01:20:55,128 --> 01:20:58,130
The crime of patricide,
or ratricide, is serious.

1212
01:20:58,215 --> 01:20:59,757
Will you hand him over?

1213
01:20:59,841 --> 01:21:04,966
No! He came back here cos he trusted
us, now you wanna put him in the Aga.

1214
01:21:06,056 --> 01:21:07,931
- No!
- (All clamouring)

1215
01:21:10,018 --> 01:21:14,395
Marietta, there's times in life
when you have to be cruel to be...

1216
01:21:14,481 --> 01:21:17,649
(Screams) Right, you little bollocks.

1217
01:21:19,069 --> 01:21:22,984
- (Marietta) What are you doing?
- Nobody bites me and lives.

1218
01:21:23,073 --> 01:21:24,817
Stop, Daddy!

1219
01:21:24,908 --> 01:21:28,159
(Phelim) Say goodbye to him.
(Pius) Go on! Do it!

1220
01:21:28,245 --> 01:21:30,369
(Matt) Can we have a bit of decorum?

1221
01:21:30,455 --> 01:21:32,282
Stop!

1222
01:21:35,919 --> 01:21:39,252
Daddy? ls it you?

1223
01:21:39,339 --> 01:21:41,629
Yes, love.

1224
01:21:41,716 --> 01:21:45,050
So, if you're you...who's that?

1225
01:21:48,932 --> 01:21:50,759
That's your mother.

1226
01:21:50,851 --> 01:21:52,642
(All) What?

1227
01:21:52,727 --> 01:21:55,681
(Squeaking)

1228
01:21:57,691 --> 01:21:59,103
Put my sister down.

1229
01:22:01,987 --> 01:22:06,483
Give me her.
Why did it happen to her?

1230
01:22:06,575 --> 01:22:09,030
Remember when
I bit her on the thumb?

1231
01:22:09,119 --> 01:22:12,655
I'd a feeling then, an instinct
you have when you're a rat,

1232
01:22:12,747 --> 01:22:15,452
that I was passing
something on to her.

1233
01:22:19,421 --> 01:22:22,672
- Isn't that the queer one?!
- The letter that...

1234
01:22:22,757 --> 01:22:25,332
I wrote it,
to throw you off the scent.

1235
01:22:25,427 --> 01:22:28,262
Put out a few droppings
and hid under the bed,

1236
01:22:28,346 --> 01:22:32,511
thinking that when the security
was relaxed, I could slip away.

1237
01:22:33,602 --> 01:22:35,726
Where'd you get the droppings?

1238
01:22:35,812 --> 01:22:37,888
I found them in the Hoover.

1239
01:22:37,981 --> 01:22:41,896
Your mother was shouting, "Come out!
You're going to the asylum!"

1240
01:22:41,985 --> 01:22:44,856
I never moved,
just lay there under the bed.

1241
01:22:44,946 --> 01:22:47,699
All of a sudden,
the feet stop walking.

1242
01:22:47,782 --> 01:22:51,199
The clothes fell down in a heap,

1243
01:22:51,286 --> 01:22:54,703
and out of the middle of them,
crawled herself.

1244
01:22:54,789 --> 01:22:56,782
(Pius) Poor little Mammy.

1245
01:22:56,875 --> 01:23:00,161
(Hubert) Earlier today,
I came across a dossier.

1246
01:23:00,253 --> 01:23:03,670
It contains
the typescript of the book.

1247
01:23:03,757 --> 01:23:07,008
"This was to be
a heart-warming story.

1248
01:23:07,093 --> 01:23:10,047
"The story of a man who became a rat,

1249
01:23:10,138 --> 01:23:13,970
"and a family who stood
by him, in love and loyalty.

1250
01:23:14,059 --> 01:23:17,974
"Alas, it was not to be.

1251
01:23:18,063 --> 01:23:21,314
"The plan of this loving family

1252
01:23:21,399 --> 01:23:26,228
"was not to protect this helpless
little creature in their midst,

1253
01:23:26,321 --> 01:23:30,070
"but to exploit his tragedy
and sacrifice him

1254
01:23:30,158 --> 01:23:33,029
"to their own heartless greed.

1255
01:23:33,119 --> 01:23:37,117
"They discussed, endlessly,
how they could be rid of him."

1256
01:23:37,207 --> 01:23:39,164
So, what should we do, Son?

1257
01:23:39,251 --> 01:23:41,243
I think we should kill him.

1258
01:23:41,336 --> 01:23:45,501
- "By poison..."
- Something painless in his food.

1259
01:23:45,590 --> 01:23:48,295
- "Drowning..."
- ..nothin' worse than a drowned rat,

1260
01:23:48,385 --> 01:23:49,962
close relation or not.

1261
01:23:50,053 --> 01:23:54,549
- "By burning him alive..."
- We should put him in the Aga.

1262
01:23:54,641 --> 01:23:57,595
"And finally, by leaving him to die

1263
01:23:57,686 --> 01:24:01,103
"a lonely and terrifying death
in a maggot factory.

1264
01:24:04,150 --> 01:24:08,944
"The greatest act of betrayal
since Julius Iscariot."

1265
01:24:09,030 --> 01:24:12,815
And speaking of Julius Iscariot...

1266
01:24:12,909 --> 01:24:15,994
- Put you in the Aga.
- Send him to the maggot factory.

1267
01:24:16,079 --> 01:24:19,448
- (All talking at once)
- But it was all true.

1268
01:24:21,126 --> 01:24:25,077
I'm afraid, like Marietta says,
there was a grain of truth.

1269
01:24:25,172 --> 01:24:28,209
This book did something to all of us.

1270
01:24:35,932 --> 01:24:39,219
It was very nearly
the ruination of the family.

1271
01:24:43,732 --> 01:24:47,018
(Marietta) Good.
(Pius) Nice one, Da.

1272
01:24:47,110 --> 01:24:50,278
(Pius) Give him his clips.
(Marietta) Get out.

1273
01:24:50,363 --> 01:24:52,605
You think you've seen the last of me?

1274
01:24:52,699 --> 01:24:57,029
- Poxy maggot, away with ya.
- One way or another, I'll be back.

1275
01:24:57,120 --> 01:25:01,071
- Get him out, Daddy.
- On your bike. Get out of here.

1276
01:25:02,709 --> 01:25:06,292
Get on your bike.
Go on! Don't come back.

1277
01:25:06,379 --> 01:25:08,954
Don't show your face
in Kimmage again,

1278
01:25:09,049 --> 01:25:10,924
if you know what's good for you.

1279
01:25:13,386 --> 01:25:17,384
Get a blanket for her cage
and a little hot water bottle.

1280
01:25:17,474 --> 01:25:20,262
- Why don't we get Father Geraldo?
- No.

1281
01:25:20,352 --> 01:25:22,594
It worked for you, why not for her?

1282
01:25:22,687 --> 01:25:27,516
I never believed it was Father
Geraldo who restored me to manhood.

1283
01:25:27,609 --> 01:25:31,441
No, I believe I came back
when I served me time

1284
01:25:31,530 --> 01:25:33,938
and learnt me lesson.

1285
01:25:34,032 --> 01:25:36,701
I also believe
your mother will come back,

1286
01:25:36,785 --> 01:25:40,570
and that, like me,
she'll be a better person.

1287
01:25:40,664 --> 01:25:42,574
Conchita.

1288
01:25:43,792 --> 01:25:46,331
