1
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:41,602
Corin, your mom just called and

2
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:42,870
left a message on the
answering machine...

3
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,306
something about dinner at
your grandmother's.

4
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:47,941
Wow...you're actually cleaning
up after your own mess.

5
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:51,078
Yeah, well, I tired of waiting
for you to do it for me...

6
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:55,983
Ahhh. Shit...

7
00:01:57,084 --> 00:01:59,052
...so why haven't you
called her back?

8
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:04,558
I told her after 5 years it's
time she realized you're
not going away...

9
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:05,559
Awww.

10
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:07,961
...Is there something going on
between you and Elliot?

11
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,129
...You can't leave me!

12
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:16,470
...All they do is destroy
other people's lives...

13
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:19,807
Corin!!!

14
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:28,849
Jake...?

15
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:32,786
Corin!!

16
00:02:49,437 --> 00:02:51,339
You took him away from me!!

17
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:58,045
The only person I've
ever loved!!!

18
00:02:58,312 --> 00:03:03,183
...the only person... the
only person...

19
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:45,426
Jake?

20
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,199
Jake?

21
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:03,176
Jake?

22
00:04:14,355 --> 00:04:16,424
The case of the murderous gay
love triangle took

23
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:20,060
another bizarre turn in a story
already fit for a
nighttime soap...

24
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,262
...a story already fit for a
nighttime soap...

25
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,299
A suicide note found alongside
the body of Jake
Verbeten confessed

26
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:29,737
to the set up framing of Marti
White for the murders of

27
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,739
Elliot Hamilton and
Corin Buckman.

28
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,874
Jake Verbeten's body
was found by his

29
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:36,076
upstairs neighbor and
friend Maggie Grace.

30
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,547
Discovery of the note has
prosecutors speculating the case

31
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,582
against Marti White will be
quickly dismissed.

32
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:50,558
What your step, uh, Eli...?

33
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:51,959
Yeah.

34
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,127
Sorry. I'm terrible with names.

35
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:55,663
Where did you say you were from?

36
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,500
Um...out west - California.

37
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,470
Oh. Good. Maybe you can bring a
little color and style
to this city.

38
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:06,440
We're sort of stuck in the 80s;
you know, big hair,
stone washed jeans

39
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:08,275
back from when they were
originally popular.

40
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:10,978
Girls named, uh, 'Cheryl,'
'Debbie' and 'Lisa?'

41
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,646
You got it. Come on.

42
00:05:15,683 --> 00:05:18,151
Well, as you can see it's
fully furnished.

43
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:22,623
On site laundry, two full baths,
a Murphy bed in the bedroom,

44
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,825
three entrances and a
private patio.

45
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,794
How long has the
furniture been here?

46
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:30,130
Oh...it's from the previous
renters. The family didn't want
most of the big stuff

47
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,932
so they left it behind.

48
00:05:37,505 --> 00:05:39,707
That's just the furnace
and a storage area

49
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:42,342
and there are some additional
items in there too.

50
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,645
What happened to the
previous renters?

51
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:48,516
Um, long story...they
both passed away.

52
00:05:49,617 --> 00:05:51,852
What? Here in the apartment?

53
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:56,657
No...no... Well - yeah.
One of them.

54
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:02,830
Well, was it carbon monoxide,
or...?

55
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,532
No no. Nothing like that...

56
00:06:04,532 --> 00:06:07,901
Just, um, some bad
circumstances.

57
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:10,037
But nothing involving the
apartment itself.

58
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,985
So - let me guess. You lived
in West Hollywood?

59
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,892
Um...Yeah. How did
you know that?

60
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:35,362
Just figured. I've been
there a few times.

61
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,768
So...what were you doing in
West Hollywood?

62
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:44,404
I don't know. I tried to
'find myself' there.

63
00:06:44,438 --> 00:06:46,173
Get a music career started.

64
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:50,744
Um...I think I got a little more
lost than I was already.

65
00:06:54,047 --> 00:07:00,187
So...Maggie. Are you a fruit
fly or a fag hag?

66
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,456
Um - what do I look like?

67
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:04,558
Oh - you look like a fruit fly.

68
00:07:04,592 --> 00:07:07,728
It's just, um, you're not
wearing your Prada.

69
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:09,963
Well, they didn't
match this outfit.

70
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:13,200
Something tells me you could
make it work if you
were in the mood.

71
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:18,138
Yeah, well...I haven't been in
much of a mood for
anything lately.

72
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:21,408
Understandable. I think we can
both share in that.

73
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:24,044
Misery loves company.

74
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:32,920
So you came to Racine
for a new start?

75
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,089
Couldn't you at least have
picked Boystown or something?

76
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:37,958
It's a little less drastic.

77
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:42,095
Yeah. I know. Um, I've got a job
interview later today,

78
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:46,133
so I figured I'd take the
morning to look around and
size up the city...

79
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:49,302
And... what do you think of our
little city so far?

80
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:52,305
It could use a touch
of Nate Berkus.

81
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,642
Hmmm - I could use a touch
of Nate Berkus.

82
00:07:54,642 --> 00:07:56,076
Yeah...who wouldn't?

83
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:01,448
Anyway, I've got family nearby
so it's a good place to
be for right now.

84
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,350
How much are you asking for?

85
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,085
$785 a month.

86
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:10,691
If you're really interested I
could forego the
security deposit.

87
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:13,827
You just really need a renter?

88
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:18,799
Well, sure, but what I really
need is someone around here
with a personality.

89
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,368
So what do you think?

90
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:23,837
I think you've got a new friend.

91
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,205
Yeah!

92
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:31,178
Um...I've gotta run, but, uh,
can I call you later
about the details?

93
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:32,279
Sure.

94
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,014
Cool. It's great to meet you.

95
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:34,848
You too...

96
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:35,549
Thank you.

97
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:36,717
You're welcome.

98
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:49,730
I don't think it's right to
mingle with that type...

99
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:16,643
Hello, Jamey...

100
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:20,480
You're 45 minutes late,
Snookums... and don't you
roll your eyes at me!

101
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,383
Just cancel my appointments for
the day. I'm not coming in.

102
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:26,820
Nancy! The Krekling account
people are...already here...

103
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,722
Tell them I've got the Bird
Flu and reschedule.

104
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:31,691
This is the reschedule! What am
I supposed to tell him?!

105
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:35,829
Alright, fine. Offer him a blow
job. I'll be there
in 20 minutes.

106
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:48,508
It's been nearly two years since
a gay love triangle
ended in bloodshed,

107
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:51,011
and a story made for a
nighttime soap opera.

108
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:55,148
But many believe the shocking
story has reached its
final chapter,

109
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:59,887
as the last of the debris from
what has come to be known as
'The Horror House,'

110
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:04,357
was cleared away to make room
for the newly
expanded Highway 32.

111
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:07,527
The road was opened today in the
spot where Elliot Hamilton

112
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:12,399
is said to have murdered his
secret lover, Corin Buckman,
in a jealous rage.

113
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,403
Hamilton's fiancee, Marti White,
was originally believed
to be involved

114
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:20,707
in the murders of both men, but
was cleared when
Buckman's other lover,

115
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:25,946
Jake Verbeten, left a suicide
note clearing Marti White of
her involvement.

116
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:31,351
The house was also the site of
an unrelated massacre
back in 1988,

117
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,753
and with many of the trees
around the land dying,

118
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,223
growing rumors and an
urban myth claim

119
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:39,726
the house itself was the cause
of its occupants' insanity.

120
00:12:45,032 --> 00:12:46,433
You're late.

121
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:59,612
You know, Emily's a
time pincher.

122
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:03,150
If she forgives you and still
gives you the job,

123
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:08,421
she'll still hold it over your
head for the next three months.

124
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:11,424
Come on.

125
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,298
Yes?

126
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:20,467
You're 11 o'clock is here, Mrs.
Hamilton.

127
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:22,269
Show him in.

128
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:26,940
Good luck.

129
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,241
He'll need it.

130
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:30,010
Thank you, Brielle.

131
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:34,147
And Brielle... This
isn't a brothel.

132
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:40,988
Have a seat.

133
00:13:55,202 --> 00:13:59,039
I believe our interview was
supposed to begin 15
minutes ago.

134
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,640
I'm...really sorry.

135
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,477
Um, I just don't really know my
way around town yet.

136
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:09,716
Oh. Well, let's take a look at
your portfolio and

137
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:14,354
I'll decide if I'm going to give
you one 'get out of jail free'
card.

138
00:14:16,623 --> 00:14:18,225
Thank you.

139
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:36,977
Any pictures of women?

140
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:40,747
Um - no.

141
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:43,516
Any particular reason?

142
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:48,555
Well... I'm gay. The male form
just catches my eye.

143
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:52,725
My art is based on
discipline and structure,

144
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:55,195
but it would be nothing
without passion.

145
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:56,596
I see.

146
00:14:57,064 --> 00:15:00,000
Now, you do know that
this magazine

147
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,670
is geared toward women -
Christian women?

148
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:07,941
I'm completely capable of
capturing the essence
of any subject.

149
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:11,911
As long as the pay is
good enough - hmm?

150
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:22,455
Well . . . I am very
impressed with your work

151
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,524
- and your attitude.

152
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:26,960
I'll give you a call
in a day or two

153
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:31,131
and let you know my decision.
May I hang onto this?

154
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:32,765
Absolutely.

155
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,801
Good. Thank you.

156
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:36,469
Thank you.

157
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,169
Where did these come from?

158
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:44,371
A co-worker who wanted to
see you smile.

159
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:45,838
Oh, Jamey. You didn't
have to do that.

160
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,007
Yes I did. The florist was
flirting with me.

161
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,309
Mmmmm...cute guy?

162
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:50,310
MMM nnnn...Girl!

163
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:52,645
She made me feel all masculine
and stuff. So uh...

164
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:53,680
Admit it, Jamey.

165
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,215
There's a big gooey
heart in there.

166
00:16:56,449 --> 00:17:00,320
Sssh. Nasty rumors will-will
totally destroy my image.

167
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:01,788
You don't have to run away.

168
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:03,356
Mmm Hmm, Mmm Hmm - I do!
I'm starving.

169
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,957
Do you want anything from
Henry & Wanda's?

170
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,293
No, I'm good. Thanks.

171
00:17:06,293 --> 00:17:08,027
Okay. Toodles.

172
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:19,206
Excuse me.

173
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:21,174
The office guy wasn't
downstairs and

174
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,675
I needed somebody to
sign for this.

175
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,878
Maybe I should've said
'office girl.'

176
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:27,747
Excuse me?

177
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,981
You know...?

178
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:36,489
Why don't you check your
humanity at the door.

179
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:37,617
Hey.

180
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,452
Oh!

181
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,254
Sorry. I didn't mean
to scare you.

182
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:43,256
I called out but I guess
you didn't hear me.

183
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:47,794
Oh...no - that's cool. I-I'm
sorry about snooping.

184
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,296
Oh no - That's okay.

185
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:51,298
Anything in here is free
for you to use.

186
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:52,599
Are you sure?

187
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,000
Yeah.

188
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,169
You wanna help me with these?

189
00:18:56,603 --> 00:18:57,470
Sure.

190
00:18:58,505 --> 00:19:01,841
You know, there are some posters
that would look better...here...

191
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:05,578
Really? Which ones?

192
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:08,948
Moulin Rouge on the left and
Madonna on the right?

193
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:13,119
Eh. Not every gay man is as
obsessed with those two...

194
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:20,327
Are you okay?

195
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:22,195
Yeah... Yeah.

196
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:26,533
I just thought it would look
better this way.

197
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:30,503
You know what? I'm being psycho.
It's your place.

198
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:33,773
You know what? I think it would
look better the way it
originally was.

199
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:36,142
No no no. I'm being silly.
Really.

200
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:42,615
No no. You know... I was... I
was just trying
something different.

201
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:45,352
I really like it the other
way much better.

202
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:01,468
We now return to "Night of
the Living De-..."

203
00:20:01,468 --> 00:20:03,336
Stupid horror movies...

204
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:50,583
You are no longer my son...

205
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:51,884
Corin did this to me!

206
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:54,921
I swear I can't control
what I'm feeling!

207
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:57,890
You are just like your father!

208
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:55,508
Hello?

209
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:57,043
It's Maggie.

210
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,479
Ugh. Come on in.

211
00:23:07,754 --> 00:23:09,856
Thought I'd try to stop by
without scaring you.

212
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:12,592
Thanks. - Hey, I was just about
to go for a bike ride.

213
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,394
Would you like to peddle along?

214
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,997
No thanks. My beauty
comes naturally.

215
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:24,504
Anyway, uh, so me and my friends
are going to Club Icon

216
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:26,773
on Thursday night and I thought
you might wanna go.

217
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,241
What's Icon?

218
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:32,344
An old gay bar with new name and
a really cool place.

219
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,947
Ahh. You go to gay bars.

220
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:37,584
Oh yeah...fruit fly.

221
00:23:38,618 --> 00:23:39,519
I don't know.

222
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:41,754
I'm not a big fan of the
queer socials.

223
00:23:42,522 --> 00:23:44,757
Why not? You're adorable.

224
00:23:44,957 --> 00:23:47,393
The boys would be on
you in seconds.

225
00:23:47,393 --> 00:23:50,362
That's exactly why. They're
just meat markets.

226
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:54,400
And it's so cliched. Big boys
acting like big girls

227
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:57,870
and twirling and doing drugs
and smoking and...

228
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,773
Don't you ever go out and
socialize, honey?

229
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,142
I go to gay friendly
establishments.

230
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:05,077
Integrate into society more.

231
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:08,214
Besides, the boys at the gay
bars are just one-nighters.

232
00:24:08,214 --> 00:24:09,816
How do you meet guys?

233
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,719
I meet the gay boys brothers.

234
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:14,621
I like my men gay.

235
00:24:14,654 --> 00:24:17,223
Well - that's not going to find
you a husband, Grace...

236
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,728
Excuse me.

237
00:24:31,838 --> 00:24:33,005
Hello?

238
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:36,609
Ooohh - lucky banana.

239
00:24:37,677 --> 00:24:41,848
Apologies. I didn't expect you
to be so overwhelmed by
my appearance.

240
00:24:41,848 --> 00:24:43,650
Do I know you?

241
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:48,420
No. I'm George - and you
must be Maggie.

242
00:24:48,855 --> 00:24:51,591
Eli tells me that you visit him
frequently here and

243
00:24:51,591 --> 00:24:53,826
since I know that he doesn't
have any other friends...

244
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:55,862
Are you his dad?

245
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:59,999
Well, I was going to say
'older brother.'

246
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,503
Hi. When did you get here?

247
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:08,140
Oh, just a few seconds ago. Just
stopped by to see the new place.

248
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:10,342
We've already done the
introductions.

249
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:15,181
I was just about to explain our
'father/son' bond...

250
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:20,620
Ohhh... Eli didn't tell me you
were such a beautiful
young woman.

251
00:25:21,554 --> 00:25:23,189
He called me young.

252
00:25:23,322 --> 00:25:25,391
Yes - he's quite the charmer.

253
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:28,127
I was just about to go
for a bike ride.

254
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:29,829
Oh. Who were you on
the phone with?

255
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:34,000
My new boss. I just got the job.

256
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,301
That's awesome!

257
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:41,140
Well - it must be nice to have a
pretty cheerleader
excited for you.

258
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:44,343
Oh, if only you were older.

259
00:25:44,343 --> 00:25:48,681
Long chocolate hair,
chestnut eyes...

260
00:25:49,181 --> 00:25:53,085
Oh, he's good. I think I have
just the lady for you.

261
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:58,257
I can't believe I let you talk
me into this Maggie.

262
00:25:58,324 --> 00:26:01,160
No. He's late and I
should be at work.

263
00:26:01,694 --> 00:26:04,530
Yeah, a blind lunch
date...that's hot.

264
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:09,836
Oooh...it is hot. Gotta go.

265
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:12,839
Nancy?

266
00:26:12,872 --> 00:26:13,840
Yes.

267
00:26:13,873 --> 00:26:14,874
I figured it had to be you.

268
00:26:14,874 --> 00:26:16,275
No other reason for
a pretty girl

269
00:26:16,275 --> 00:26:18,077
to be sitting all by
herself at lunch.

270
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:19,045
Seat.

271
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,181
Sorry for my tardiness.
I took a fall.

272
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:23,115
Oh no...

273
00:26:23,115 --> 00:26:24,751
Oh - it gets better.

274
00:26:27,553 --> 00:26:29,756
The karma gods are not
pleased with me today.

275
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:31,724
What did you do to
tick them off?

276
00:26:31,724 --> 00:26:33,292
Just being me.

277
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,555
Ride your bike, man!

278
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:35,955
Beautiful.

279
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,959
Awesome.

280
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,596
Okay, Reagan, put your chin
up a little bit.

281
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:45,998
There you go.

282
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,335
Smile. Smile.

283
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:51,003
Well, he certainly seems
to know his way

284
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:53,439
around better than the last
retard you hired.

285
00:27:53,973 --> 00:27:55,307
I can see that, Dick.

286
00:27:55,708 --> 00:28:00,012
He's very intense...mysterious.

287
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:01,180
Awesome!

288
00:28:03,115 --> 00:28:04,884
You are gorgeous.

289
00:28:08,654 --> 00:28:09,789
Smile.

290
00:28:11,457 --> 00:28:13,392
Do I have to give you a
raise so that

291
00:28:13,459 --> 00:28:16,395
you can afford a 'complete'
outfit?

292
00:28:19,165 --> 00:28:20,132
Awesome.

293
00:28:21,901 --> 00:28:23,335
There you go.

294
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:25,704
I was quite impressed
with you today.

295
00:28:25,738 --> 00:28:28,307
I'm really excited to
see the results.

296
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:29,909
I think you'll be pleased.

297
00:28:30,476 --> 00:28:34,046
You know, Eli, I was a
bit taken aback

298
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,984
by your confession of your...
orientation.

299
00:28:39,251 --> 00:28:41,153
I'm not ashamed of it.

300
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:46,759
I can respect that it
inspires your work, but,

301
00:28:46,826 --> 00:28:52,698
I would appreciate you keeping
it at home, and out
of the office.

302
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:56,568
Well, I've always kept my
personal life just that...

303
00:28:58,004 --> 00:28:59,238
Personal.

304
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:01,841
I'm sorry for being so brazen.

305
00:29:01,841 --> 00:29:04,610
I grew up in a very
religious household.

306
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:07,179
It wasn't something
we discussed.

307
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:12,852
Then I found out that my
husband was gay.

308
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,856
After 8 years of marriage.

309
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,359
That had to have been hard.

310
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:23,695
I didn't even know what gay was.

311
00:29:25,297 --> 00:29:30,402
I literally didn't know such
a thing existed!

312
00:29:30,402 --> 00:29:33,639
I think it would make for
a great memoir.

313
00:29:34,373 --> 00:29:41,247
Well, I think, it is best, to
leave private affairs...private.

314
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,889
My son used to play the piano.

315
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:55,394
It was the only thing he was
ever really talented at.

316
00:29:57,329 --> 00:30:03,435
Oh. It's not a very motherly
thing to say, is it?

317
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:08,774
It's better to accept the truth.
Music makes the world go round.

318
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:12,778
I've got tickets to Anne
Murray next week.

319
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:16,115
Oh, I love Anne Murray!

320
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,651
But aren't you just a...

321
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:22,588
...a little young to
listen Anne Murray.

322
00:30:22,588 --> 00:30:24,123
I don't think so.

323
00:30:24,123 --> 00:30:27,359
I think that if more people
listened to Anne Murray,

324
00:30:28,127 --> 00:30:30,930
there would be fewer
assholes in the world.

325
00:30:32,464 --> 00:30:34,666
I'll drink to that.

326
00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:55,221
Marti.

327
00:31:04,897 --> 00:31:05,864
Marti!

328
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:20,606
Pick up on aisle 4.

329
00:32:21,073 --> 00:32:23,309
So, you're settling into
the apartment?

330
00:32:25,211 --> 00:32:27,446
Almost done. Just a
few more boxes.

331
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:29,315
That's too fattening.

332
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,452
I'm the one filling
your cupboards,

333
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:35,721
so you might want to be a
little less pissy.

334
00:32:36,555 --> 00:32:38,624
How's the new job working out?

335
00:32:39,992 --> 00:32:43,895
Fine. I'm going to a concert
with Emily next week.

336
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:46,498
Oh, good. Gets you in
closer with her.

337
00:32:47,933 --> 00:32:49,301
How's things going with Nancy?

338
00:32:49,335 --> 00:32:52,671
Oh, very good. We have a
picnic date on Sunday.

339
00:32:53,272 --> 00:32:55,141
Well, I guess that's
good for you then.

340
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:07,086
Could you not do that right
in front of me?

341
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:15,194
So you came here just to
keep an eye on Eli?

342
00:33:15,194 --> 00:33:17,463
I know it sounds a bit
overprotective...

343
00:33:17,463 --> 00:33:18,830
Yeah, kinda.

344
00:33:19,865 --> 00:33:22,268
He'll always be my boy.

345
00:33:23,169 --> 00:33:24,503
So what about you?

346
00:33:24,636 --> 00:33:26,672
Why is a lady with a face and
figure like yours

347
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:28,974
not being clawed after by
every man in town?

348
00:33:28,974 --> 00:33:32,344
Because men my age are either
married, fat or gay.

349
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,847
Besides, I always seem to find
myself attracted to gay men.

350
00:33:36,215 --> 00:33:38,284
So you've never been
serious with anyone?

351
00:33:38,284 --> 00:33:42,321
Oh, yeah. Absolutely. I was
married for 3 years. No kids.

352
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:45,157
And then he became jealous of
my modeling career.

353
00:33:45,391 --> 00:33:46,692
You modeled?!

354
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,694
Don't sound so surprised.

355
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:51,463
Well, what was that like?

356
00:33:51,463 --> 00:33:53,965
It was the best time of my
life - and then

357
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:57,803
I started to grow
older...America's biggest sin.

358
00:33:58,837 --> 00:34:00,406
Hold on a second...

359
00:34:25,497 --> 00:34:30,436
Very nice. And you just
walked away from it?!

360
00:34:30,502 --> 00:34:32,171
More like I escaped.

361
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:37,709
Well I think you're still an
absolutely gorgeous woman.

362
00:34:38,944 --> 00:34:43,349
All America wants to see are
sexy young things writhing
around on each other...

363
00:34:43,549 --> 00:34:45,083
Don't you?

364
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:58,864
How you doin'?

365
00:35:00,065 --> 00:35:00,966
Fine.

366
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:05,070
Yeah. Not exactly having the
time of your life, huh?

367
00:35:06,372 --> 00:35:08,374
Come on. Let's go get
another cocktail.

368
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,229
I'll be right back.

369
00:35:39,338 --> 00:35:42,608
Oh...I'm sorry. I'll - um...

370
00:35:42,608 --> 00:35:43,309
It's okay.

371
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:44,943
Do you want another drink?

372
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,745
Uh, no. I'm half full.

373
00:35:47,246 --> 00:35:50,916
Oh - my my my. Fresh meat.

374
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:53,819
I don't think I've ever seen
you online before.

375
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:58,290
Well that's because I prefer to
meet my fuck friends in
person first.

376
00:35:59,758 --> 00:36:02,194
You'll have to excuse Chantal.

377
00:36:02,261 --> 00:36:05,130
Her southern manners keep going
further south than her jowl.

378
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:12,304
Josie, grrrrrl. I see they
finally let you out of prison
and...(sniff sniff)

379
00:36:12,304 --> 00:36:15,307
by the smell of things you're
definitely missing
those showers.

380
00:36:15,307 --> 00:36:19,445
Come on, Evillyne. It's time to
hop on your broom and scare some
other little boys.

381
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:24,216
Snag him, Lambchop. You two
would make an adorable couple.

382
00:36:27,286 --> 00:36:31,723
Well, that certainly wasn't how
I pictured meeting you. I'm Red.

383
00:36:32,658 --> 00:36:33,825
Oh, I - I'm Eli.

384
00:36:35,561 --> 00:36:37,563
Do you wanna dance?

385
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:45,471
Oh, no. It's - it's not you.
It's just, um, I don't really
get into all that twirling

386
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:47,406
and, stuff, I guess.

387
00:36:47,406 --> 00:36:50,542
So - how about a cocktail and
some nice conversation?

388
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,344
That I can do.

389
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:57,849
No. My family is wonderful.

390
00:36:57,883 --> 00:37:01,753
I bring boyfriends to holidays,
family functions...everything.

391
00:37:02,087 --> 00:37:05,090
So - lots of boyfriends then,
huh?

392
00:37:05,391 --> 00:37:08,260
No. Just two in the
last nine years.

393
00:37:08,427 --> 00:37:10,762
You're not like a lot of the
guys here, are you?

394
00:37:11,029 --> 00:37:12,197
Hey...

395
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:17,703
I kind of have a...situation.

396
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:23,742
Alright. I've left you boys
alone long enough.

397
00:37:25,877 --> 00:37:27,879
Hmm. Good job?

398
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:28,880
Farmer.

399
00:37:29,281 --> 00:37:32,951
Hmm. Shoulda guessed.
Gotta truck?

400
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:34,286
Yeah.

401
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:36,922
Good family?

402
00:37:37,122 --> 00:37:40,292
Somewhere between '7th Heaven'
and 'Eight is Enough.'

403
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:42,027
I see.

404
00:37:42,861 --> 00:37:43,795
Hung?

405
00:37:44,463 --> 00:37:47,766
Okay. Time to take the
size queen home.

406
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:50,436
Home?! We have an
after bar to hit!

407
00:37:50,636 --> 00:37:51,570
Okay!

408
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:53,905
Alright! Let's go let's go!

409
00:37:55,307 --> 00:37:57,976
I had a great time. Bye.

410
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:15,961
Ugh...Lord! Lightweight. How
much did you have to drink
at the afterbar?!

411
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:17,463
I miss him?

412
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:18,897
What? Who?

413
00:38:18,897 --> 00:38:20,098
I miss him.

414
00:38:20,098 --> 00:38:21,066
Who?

415
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:22,267
I...

416
00:38:29,775 --> 00:38:33,278
No no no no no no -
don't read that!

417
00:38:33,278 --> 00:38:34,580
Why?

418
00:38:39,084 --> 00:38:44,690
Come here...come here...uhhh...

419
00:39:12,451 --> 00:39:14,285
I'm not afraid of you, Elliot.

420
00:39:31,503 --> 00:39:34,372
We'd like to get there
before tomorrow, Eli.

421
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:39,845
Seriously. Just go without me,
alright?

422
00:39:39,845 --> 00:39:42,213
I've got to get ready for
the concert anyway.

423
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,150
Exactly how many did you
tie on last night?

424
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,518
Just a few.

425
00:39:46,518 --> 00:39:47,686
With who?

426
00:39:48,854 --> 00:39:51,990
Just Maggie. It's no big deal.
Okay?

427
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:54,359
Yeah. Well, I've heard those
words out of your mouth before.

428
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:57,496
Hey guys, it's fine. We can
do this next week.

429
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:01,066
Mom?!

430
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,001
What are you doing here?

431
00:40:03,602 --> 00:40:05,370
What's she doing here?

432
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,872
Mom, what are you doing here?

433
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:09,274
Who's that? Another victim?!

434
00:40:10,442 --> 00:40:13,244
I thought I told you I didn't
like you hanging out with him!

435
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,846
I take it she's the ex?

436
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:19,084
Well let's just say that Hillary
and I are not overly fond
of each other.

437
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:24,590
I thought we had an agreement
that he's a bad
influence on you.

438
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:26,558
It's fine, mom.

439
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:28,927
I'm just trying to
look out for you.

440
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:30,862
That's a change of pace.

441
00:40:31,296 --> 00:40:32,263
Nice.

442
00:40:32,798 --> 00:40:33,799
I'm sorry.

443
00:40:34,866 --> 00:40:38,103
Look - I just wanted to see you.

444
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:42,107
I had to go to your old landlord
to find out where you live now.

445
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:44,976
I mean weren't you ever going to
tell me where you moved?

446
00:40:45,644 --> 00:40:47,913
I don't know how long I'm
going to be here,

447
00:40:47,913 --> 00:40:50,148
so I didn't want to make a
big deal out of it.

448
00:40:50,215 --> 00:40:52,217
I would have called you
at some point.

449
00:40:53,752 --> 00:40:57,823
Look...I don't care what you do.

450
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,925
I don't care who you see.

451
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:03,562
I just want to be a
part of your life.

452
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:07,933
Okay? I'm trying here.

453
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,068
I know.

454
00:41:13,004 --> 00:41:16,174
You know you're Uncle Bob just
came out of the closet recently.

455
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:19,410
Maybe this whole thing, it comes
from my side of the family.

456
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:21,847
Christ, mom, it's not a disease.

457
00:41:21,847 --> 00:41:24,349
No, I know, but I saw this Oprah
show where they...

458
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:27,586
Oprah didn't grow up inside
of my head - I did!

459
00:41:27,653 --> 00:41:31,089
No - I know. But this is not
about what's going
on with you...

460
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:37,128
It is not! It's about you
connecting with that scumbag
in there and not me.

461
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:38,997
There's a big difference.

462
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:44,703
No offense, mom, but he's been
around for me a lot
longer than you have!

463
00:41:44,703 --> 00:41:46,471
Oh...

464
00:41:48,206 --> 00:41:50,475
Maybe it was your grandfather.

465
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:54,145
Drop it, mom.

466
00:41:56,147 --> 00:41:57,315
Honey...

467
00:41:57,315 --> 00:42:02,520
Look - I'm really glad you came
here, I really am,

468
00:42:03,321 --> 00:42:09,294
but right now is a really bad
time. I have to get going.

469
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,830
Can I see you tomorrow?

470
00:42:12,664 --> 00:42:14,499
I don't know.

471
00:42:15,734 --> 00:42:17,803
I love you.

472
00:42:22,007 --> 00:42:23,975
I'll call you tomorrow.

473
00:42:25,744 --> 00:42:26,745
Okay.

474
00:42:28,747 --> 00:42:32,483
Dick, there is no way they can
do that. I told you.

475
00:42:32,517 --> 00:42:36,254
Hang on... Ah, come on in. I'll
be finished in a minute.

476
00:42:36,321 --> 00:42:38,690
You just make yourself at home.
Go right in there.

477
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:39,658
Okay.

478
00:42:39,825 --> 00:42:42,761
Alright. Listen to me, Dick.
It's not that....

479
00:43:48,259 --> 00:43:54,966
Give it everything you've got,
you're your own worst enemy.

480
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,270
No, Dick, no. We have a
contract. There is...

481
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:01,439
Drinking spirits taking shots,
glass still...

482
00:44:01,439 --> 00:44:02,808
...remains half empty.

483
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:07,746
Uh, no. We're going to have to
talk about this tomorrow.

484
00:44:08,346 --> 00:44:09,748
Yeah - bye bye.

485
00:44:10,749 --> 00:44:14,152
The love I give will never stop.

486
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:24,162
You don't wanna wait and see
it's sweet suicide to my life,

487
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:31,136
saving you every time, I
catch you half alive.

488
00:44:31,436 --> 00:44:34,105
Wish I could compete...

489
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:38,844
with your perfect goodbye.

490
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:42,513
the sweat of your
thousand tries,

491
00:44:42,948 --> 00:44:49,620
the threat of the same blue sky,
so sweet....

492
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,308
I'm sorry.

493
00:45:10,675 --> 00:45:12,510
It's - it's okay.

494
00:45:17,082 --> 00:45:19,985
I - I miss having a
piano at home.

495
00:45:20,685 --> 00:45:23,321
Those prose were just beautiful.

496
00:45:24,155 --> 00:45:27,192
Well, um, I - I wrote
them myself.

497
00:45:30,528 --> 00:45:33,664
Oh - let me get you a kleenex.

498
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:38,669
Oh, no no. It's fine. It's
barely a paper cut.

499
00:45:43,341 --> 00:45:45,010
We should get going.

500
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:46,044
Okay.

501
00:45:46,211 --> 00:45:49,781
Has anyone in the office talked
to you about my son?

502
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,619
I've heard mumblings.

503
00:45:55,286 --> 00:46:00,458
I figured. Elliot certainly did
leave an impression...

504
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:03,862
just not the kind I'd hoped for.

505
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:09,634
I know plenty of details, and we
don't have to go into it if
you're uncomfortable.

506
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:13,038
You know he was gay?

507
00:46:13,038 --> 00:46:13,972
Yes.

508
00:46:15,874 --> 00:46:17,742
I blame myself.

509
00:46:19,444 --> 00:46:21,146
For him being gay?

510
00:46:21,146 --> 00:46:23,815
No no. No, not that.

511
00:46:24,482 --> 00:46:26,651
For not accepting it.

512
00:46:26,918 --> 00:46:28,820
But mom!

513
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:31,789
Get out of my house!

514
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:39,630
I think I was at fault for
his losing touch...

515
00:46:40,832 --> 00:46:45,136
I wasn't there at the precise
moment he needed me most.

516
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:49,007
But you know what's ironic?

517
00:46:49,474 --> 00:46:55,313
I didn't want my parents to
know. They already knew!

518
00:47:01,419 --> 00:47:04,455
They blame me. Yeah...

519
00:47:04,455 --> 00:47:06,324
It's not your fault.

520
00:47:06,357 --> 00:47:08,659
No. My mother said to me,

521
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:16,467
'You put yourself before your
son, and that makes you
a bad mother.'

522
00:47:17,869 --> 00:47:19,670
Didn't Elliot have a girlfriend?

523
00:47:19,704 --> 00:47:22,040
Yeah. Yeah, Marti.

524
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,675
Well whatever happened to her?

525
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:27,712
I don't know.

526
00:47:28,213 --> 00:47:32,683
The trial ended with that
young man's confession,

527
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:35,453
and then she just disappeared.

528
00:47:36,221 --> 00:47:40,525
I called her brother a
few months ago,

529
00:47:40,525 --> 00:47:43,128
but he didn't know where
she was either.

530
00:47:43,895 --> 00:47:47,999
You know, I couldn't tell if he
was embarrassed for her...

531
00:47:48,499 --> 00:47:50,368
or of her.

532
00:47:51,069 --> 00:47:52,837
Family sucks.

533
00:47:57,308 --> 00:47:59,377
Mmmm. Look.

534
00:48:04,149 --> 00:48:06,484
What is she? 16...17?

535
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,156
She's gonna have that baby,
and after a month of

536
00:48:11,156 --> 00:48:13,258
not being able to hang out with
her friends at the mall,

537
00:48:14,259 --> 00:48:18,096
she's gonna dump it off on her
parents and go on her merry way.

538
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:21,933
The kid will grow up
lost and alone,

539
00:48:23,334 --> 00:48:26,437
and blame the rest of the world.

540
00:48:29,674 --> 00:48:32,277
Oh - we'd better get to Anne.

541
00:48:33,078 --> 00:48:35,680
Okay. Let's fly, Snowbird.

542
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,358
Handsome fella.

543
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:51,129
That's Corin. One of my favorite
people in the world.

544
00:48:51,229 --> 00:48:53,631
Well, you certainly have plenty
of his pictures around here.

545
00:48:53,631 --> 00:48:54,865
Should I be worried?

546
00:48:54,865 --> 00:48:56,534
No. There's no need
to be jealous.

547
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:58,869
He's not with us anymore.

548
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:00,038
Oh.

549
00:49:00,205 --> 00:49:03,274
Besides, even if he were he
wouldn't be much of a threat.

550
00:49:03,408 --> 00:49:04,575
Too conceited?

551
00:49:04,575 --> 00:49:06,377
No, too gay.

552
00:49:08,113 --> 00:49:11,716
Well, you certainly seem to
support the rainbow flag.

553
00:49:11,749 --> 00:49:14,219
Yeah, I do. Don't you?

554
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:18,056
Can't say I've had too many good
experiences with it.

555
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:20,591
My wife wasn't a big fan of it.

556
00:49:20,758 --> 00:49:22,660
Took away so much from my son.

557
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:25,596
Shouldn't you be more open
minded since you're son is gay?

558
00:49:26,731 --> 00:49:29,334
Let's not discuss my son.

559
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,089
Well maybe you just left it
open and forgot.

560
00:50:58,189 --> 00:51:00,858
I have central air, Maggie.
I never open them.

561
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,393
And the cops didn't
find anything.

562
00:51:02,427 --> 00:51:05,230
No. They searched the whole
place. Nothing's missing.

563
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:07,064
Well, do you want me
to come over?

564
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:10,535
No no. George will be here in a
little while. I'll be fine.

565
00:51:10,535 --> 00:51:12,069
How's that going?

566
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:16,274
I'm not sure. At first we had
this really great connection.

567
00:51:16,274 --> 00:51:19,844
The same kind I had with Corin -
minus the queer part.

568
00:51:19,844 --> 00:51:21,579
So what's the problem?

569
00:51:22,513 --> 00:51:24,282
I can't put my finger on it.

570
00:51:24,382 --> 00:51:26,517
Whenever I start to dig
he pulls away.

571
00:51:26,551 --> 00:51:28,219
Is the sex at least decent?

572
00:51:28,253 --> 00:51:30,355
That's just it! We still
haven't done anything!

573
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:33,057
I mean I understand the myth of
waiting until you're in love,

574
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,126
but what guy would not put out
when a woman offers,

575
00:51:35,126 --> 00:51:36,961
especially after three weeks?!

576
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:38,729
He barely kisses me!

577
00:51:39,397 --> 00:51:42,066
Well - you know, you have a
knack for dating gay men.

578
00:51:42,233 --> 00:51:44,269
No, he's too homophobic.

579
00:51:45,035 --> 00:51:47,638
Do you think he could be
a closet case?

580
00:51:47,972 --> 00:51:49,106
Nancy?!

581
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,107
Jesus George!

582
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:51,442
Gosh, I'm sorry.

583
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:52,477
What's going on?!

584
00:51:52,477 --> 00:51:53,611
No no. I'm fine.

585
00:51:53,778 --> 00:51:56,314
George can't seem to make an
entrance like normal people.

586
00:51:56,314 --> 00:51:58,449
He always has to make
"an ENTRANCE!"

587
00:51:58,549 --> 00:52:00,818
Yeah, I'll talk to you later.
Bye bye.

588
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:03,154
What?!

589
00:52:03,388 --> 00:52:05,423
One of these times you're
going to catch me with

590
00:52:05,423 --> 00:52:07,992
a knife in my hands and you'll
be short one nut.

591
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:26,911
My car broke down.

592
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,983
I can not believe you were out
in this storm anyway.

593
00:52:33,017 --> 00:52:35,686
You know we have a tornado
watch until 1 a.m.?

594
00:52:36,954 --> 00:52:39,257
I never concern myself with
stuff like that.

595
00:52:39,257 --> 00:52:41,759
If God wants me he'll get
me wherever I am.

596
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:43,761
Oh.

597
00:52:50,935 --> 00:52:52,770
Are you sure this is okay?

598
00:52:53,037 --> 00:52:57,141
You're soaking wet, Elliot - uh,
Eli.

599
00:53:02,146 --> 00:53:07,552
Elliot was a little smaller than
you, but these should
work for tonight.

600
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:12,490
You know, un, I can call a
cab to take me home.

601
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:15,993
Don't be ridiculous. Now you
just sleep here and

602
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:19,230
we'll figure out the car
situation in the morning.

603
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:24,034
I - uh, I'll go put
on some coffee.

604
00:54:07,878 --> 00:54:12,283
Marti?! Marti?!

605
00:54:17,422 --> 00:54:19,957
I just needed to get away
from everything.

606
00:54:20,024 --> 00:54:22,192
But you could have said goodbye.

607
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:24,529
At least let me know
you were okay.

608
00:54:24,562 --> 00:54:26,531
You were one of the
reasons that I ran.

609
00:54:27,298 --> 00:54:29,099
I just couldn't look
you in the eye.

610
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,436
You remind me so much of him.

611
00:54:33,804 --> 00:54:37,141
But there's something else that
brings back Elliot to
me every day,

612
00:54:38,142 --> 00:54:40,110
and I've tried to deal with it
the best that I can,

613
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,046
but I really think that
you're the only person

614
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:44,749
that can help me deal with it
the way that I should.

615
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:58,563
Oh - oh Marti, this is Eli.

616
00:54:58,563 --> 00:55:00,431
He's my staff photographer.

617
00:55:00,465 --> 00:55:01,432
Hi.

618
00:55:02,767 --> 00:55:05,770
Mrs. Hamilton, I -
I've got to go...

619
00:55:05,936 --> 00:55:08,939
Marti? Marti?!

620
00:55:37,001 --> 00:55:39,269
Goodnight, Elliot.

621
00:55:55,319 --> 00:55:57,455
Are you sure about this?

622
00:55:57,555 --> 00:55:59,390
You don't have a car.

623
00:55:59,724 --> 00:56:02,126
Now you use this until
yours gets fixed.

624
00:56:02,126 --> 00:56:04,228
Come on, go on.

625
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:19,844
Oh. I told Elliot repeatedly
to get that fixed.

626
00:56:19,844 --> 00:56:22,647
No, no. It's fine.

627
00:56:22,647 --> 00:56:24,915
Thank you for letting
me use his car.

628
00:56:32,757 --> 00:56:34,391
Are you okay?

629
00:56:35,893 --> 00:56:40,731
Yes. Y-yeah...I'll be fine.
Excuse me.

630
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:55,112
You've got to be
fucking kidding me...

631
00:57:00,017 --> 00:57:02,720
Oh hey, I haven't seen
you in a while.

632
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,555
Can I put these in Mrs.
Hamilton's office?

633
00:57:04,555 --> 00:57:06,256
Oh, you can leave them
here with me.

634
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:09,927
No, that's okay. I'd rather put
them there myself.

635
00:57:14,298 --> 00:57:17,267
Oh, I really like the angle of
my jaw in this one.

636
00:57:17,868 --> 00:57:19,804
Oh, we have a visitor.

637
00:57:19,804 --> 00:57:22,039
What are you doing here?

638
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:25,409
I don't know what you mean.

639
00:57:25,409 --> 00:57:26,977
You're living in that house.

640
00:57:27,645 --> 00:57:29,980
You're driving Elliot's car.

641
00:57:30,414 --> 00:57:32,717
You're spending time with
her at her house.

642
00:57:32,717 --> 00:57:34,652
You work for her!

643
00:57:34,652 --> 00:57:36,487
I'm not following you, Marti.

644
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:38,623
I want you to stay
away from her.

645
00:57:38,623 --> 00:57:43,160
Your kind does nothing but evil.
Stay away!

646
00:57:48,933 --> 00:57:50,668
He's only 5 minutes late.

647
00:57:50,668 --> 00:57:53,270
He's always only 5 minutes late.

648
00:57:53,771 --> 00:57:57,141
People irritate me just
by breathing.

649
00:57:57,174 --> 00:57:59,744
So the whole world
revolves around you.

650
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:03,113
Yeah. Sometimes it does.

651
00:58:03,147 --> 00:58:04,982
Other times I'd just like a
little common courtesy,

652
00:58:05,082 --> 00:58:07,918
but that doesn't seem to exist
now anymore, does it?

653
00:58:07,952 --> 00:58:10,955
Ah, courtesy - as in
showing up on time.

654
00:58:12,122 --> 00:58:13,658
Hi. May I take your order?

655
00:58:13,658 --> 00:58:15,092
I think we need a few
more minutes.

656
00:58:15,092 --> 00:58:16,126
Okay.

657
00:58:16,661 --> 00:58:19,363
I remember this movie,
'Night of the Comet.'

658
00:58:19,463 --> 00:58:21,365
It was about how these two
women woke up and

659
00:58:21,431 --> 00:58:23,968
found they were the only two
people left on earth.

660
00:58:24,168 --> 00:58:26,837
I've always wished that that
would happen to me.

661
00:58:26,837 --> 00:58:28,939
But then you'd be alone forever.

662
00:58:28,939 --> 00:58:31,308
Never any love or companionship.

663
00:58:31,308 --> 00:58:32,710
Exactly.

664
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:34,979
Hey. I didn't know you
came here too.

665
00:58:34,979 --> 00:58:36,380
How was lunch?

666
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:38,348
We haven't eaten yet...uh...

667
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:40,284
This is Red.

668
00:58:40,484 --> 00:58:42,653
This is George and Nancy.

669
00:58:42,653 --> 00:58:44,154
Nice to meet you.

670
00:58:44,154 --> 00:58:47,191
I should get running.
See you soon?

671
00:58:47,391 --> 00:58:48,358
Sure.

672
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:49,326
Nice to meet you.

673
00:58:49,326 --> 00:58:50,661
You too.

674
00:58:53,964 --> 00:58:55,733
Good friend of yours?

675
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:58,569
Just some guy I met at
Icon last week.

676
00:58:59,036 --> 00:59:00,638
Oh.

677
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:15,886
Kedric, tilt your
head to the left.

678
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:19,523
To your left, Kedric.

679
00:59:28,733 --> 00:59:30,167
Good morning, Brielle.

680
00:59:30,167 --> 00:59:31,368
Good morning.

681
00:59:31,368 --> 00:59:32,770
Has Eli arrived yet?

682
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:35,072
Oh, I'm not sure. I
haven't seen him yet.

683
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:36,040
Alright, thank you.

684
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:36,841
Mmmm Hmmm.

685
00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:38,943
You look very nice today.

686
00:59:39,777 --> 00:59:41,278
Thank you.

687
00:59:41,946 --> 00:59:43,881
Oh, morning Dick.

688
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:29,293
What are these?!

689
01:00:29,326 --> 01:00:31,561
These are just for my portfolio.

690
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:35,465
You do not do these kinds of
things on my property.

691
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:38,335
I - I did these after hours,
Emily.

692
01:00:38,435 --> 01:00:40,604
Don't you talk back to me,
Elliot!

693
01:01:48,472 --> 01:01:50,040
That's a pretty ring you've got.

694
01:01:50,407 --> 01:01:51,708
Thanks.

695
01:01:52,642 --> 01:01:54,078
What's wrong?

696
01:01:54,344 --> 01:01:56,046
They took my ball.

697
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:57,647
They took your ball?

698
01:01:59,884 --> 01:02:03,187
Was it their turn to play with
it, or did they
just...they just took it?

699
01:02:03,187 --> 01:02:05,089
They just took it.

700
01:02:09,326 --> 01:02:11,261
You wait here, Princess, okay?

701
01:02:11,261 --> 01:02:12,830
Okay.

702
01:02:27,711 --> 01:02:29,880
Did you take this from
that little girl?

703
01:02:33,017 --> 01:02:35,219
I asked you a question.

704
01:02:35,219 --> 01:02:41,291
Why? I mean, you've got plenty
of friends to play with. I'm
sure that you can think

705
01:02:41,291 --> 01:02:43,527
of something better to do
with your time.

706
01:02:46,964 --> 01:02:52,402
Thank you. Maybe if you invited
her to play with you she'd be
willing to share it.

707
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:04,548
Hey- here you go, sweetie. Okay.

708
01:04:45,015 --> 01:04:46,250
Hello?

709
01:04:48,518 --> 01:04:52,089
Emily? Dick?

710
01:05:05,702 --> 01:05:07,104
Hey - somebody had better answer

711
01:05:07,104 --> 01:05:09,173
or I'm setting the
alarm when I leave.

712
01:05:18,949 --> 01:05:21,751
Hello? Hey.

713
01:05:25,789 --> 01:05:30,927
Right now? Okay, yeah. No,
no sure.

714
01:05:34,798 --> 01:05:36,366
Okay, yeah.

715
01:05:36,366 --> 01:05:38,802
I'll meet you in 20 minutes.

716
01:05:39,403 --> 01:05:41,571
Okay. Bye.

717
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:46,310
I'm really sorry I
keep bitching.

718
01:05:46,310 --> 01:05:47,711
It's okay.

719
01:05:47,877 --> 01:05:51,982
I guess I just don't understand
why you're so upset
about everything.

720
01:05:54,284 --> 01:06:01,491
I'm just tired. Ya know? I'm
tired of people. I'm
tired of society.

721
01:06:01,992 --> 01:06:07,497
I'm tired of everything life
claims to offer but is
never fulfilled.

722
01:06:07,731 --> 01:06:10,434
I just feel lost, you know?

723
01:06:12,269 --> 01:06:15,405
I've made decisions I never
thought I'd make 10 years ago.

724
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:20,310
The people that I always thought
would be there for me
aren't anymore.

725
01:06:21,411 --> 01:06:25,682
I have a mother who wants to be
a part of my life,

726
01:06:25,682 --> 01:06:28,152
but I don't think I
want her in it.

727
01:06:28,418 --> 01:06:30,154
Too little, too late?

728
01:06:32,289 --> 01:06:34,124
I just can't let people in.

729
01:06:34,458 --> 01:06:36,960
Can you let me in?

730
01:06:41,198 --> 01:06:49,273
No. I can't. I just
can't right now.

731
01:06:51,375 --> 01:06:54,278
Well, I can wait.

732
01:06:55,679 --> 01:07:02,352
Ohhh. A lover's quarrel so soon.
Like I didn't see THAT coming?

733
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:04,688
Do I even know you?

734
01:07:04,688 --> 01:07:10,860
Bitch, you should! I mean, it's
the only way you're going to
become something in this place.

735
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:15,665
I don't need to be anything in
this bar. I need to be
something out there!

736
01:07:16,166 --> 01:07:19,503
Grrrl. You got your
fangs out again?

737
01:07:19,503 --> 01:07:21,371
Leave the snowbirds alone.

738
01:07:21,405 --> 01:07:23,373
There's some ignorant little
twinks in the back to torture.

739
01:07:23,407 --> 01:07:26,410
Grrrl! I am not done with
this cheap tart yet!

740
01:07:26,510 --> 01:07:28,378
Grrrl. She's not cheap.

741
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:31,881
In fact, I'm sure she's worth
more than she realizes.

742
01:07:32,316 --> 01:07:36,386
Red, you take care of this one.
Mend his wings and he will soar.

743
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:39,089
Bitch, you are not Jonathan
Livingston Segall.

744
01:07:39,189 --> 01:07:40,524
And you aren't young
enough to make

745
01:07:40,524 --> 01:07:42,326
those Good Will
threads look trendy.

746
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:44,161
Come on, Skank.

747
01:07:44,194 --> 01:07:45,762
Your broom is waiting to
take you home.

748
01:07:45,829 --> 01:07:47,897
Not until I plug it in first.

749
01:07:52,336 --> 01:07:55,172
Does there have to be drama
every time I come in here?

750
01:07:55,172 --> 01:07:56,606
Yes!

751
01:07:59,709 --> 01:08:02,946
So...can I see you again?

752
01:08:05,949 --> 01:08:11,388
Maybe. I really want to. I
just need time.

753
01:08:15,792 --> 01:08:17,794
That I can give you.

754
01:09:34,471 --> 01:09:37,441
Damn, you're looking
especially gorgeous tonight.

755
01:09:37,441 --> 01:09:38,608
Mmm Hmmm.

756
01:09:38,775 --> 01:09:41,177
For as much as you're on Eli's
case about being on time...

757
01:09:41,211 --> 01:09:44,448
Well I had some dirty business
I had to clean up.

758
01:09:48,285 --> 01:09:50,720
White and pure - just like you.

759
01:09:51,655 --> 01:09:53,790
Who are you kidding?

760
01:09:53,790 --> 01:09:56,293
What? You don't like
white roses?

761
01:09:57,727 --> 01:10:00,464
Let's just say I have an
issue with them.

762
01:10:02,566 --> 01:10:04,167
Have you been drinking?

763
01:10:04,167 --> 01:10:06,736
A couple. I needed to relax.

764
01:10:09,906 --> 01:10:11,040
Bad day?

765
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:14,711
Just got me thinking about the
ex-wife got me all riled up.

766
01:10:14,978 --> 01:10:17,247
Did Hillary really do
that much damage?

767
01:10:17,247 --> 01:10:20,350
Who? Oh yeah.

768
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:21,918
Could we not bring that name up?

769
01:10:21,918 --> 01:10:24,053
She's a pain in my ass too.

770
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:26,155
Do you have anything
else to drink?

771
01:10:27,391 --> 01:10:29,759
George, I need to ask
you something

772
01:10:29,759 --> 01:10:31,895
and I want you to be
completely honest with me.

773
01:10:31,928 --> 01:10:34,498
Well this certainly
doesn't sound good.

774
01:10:34,931 --> 01:10:37,200
Are you sure that
you're into women?

775
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:40,370
I mean, if you're honest with me
now I'll totally understand.

776
01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:42,672
Who got you thinking about that?

777
01:10:42,672 --> 01:10:44,408
You did, George.

778
01:10:44,408 --> 01:10:46,410
I mean, we've been seeing each
other for almost a month

779
01:10:46,410 --> 01:10:48,011
and you never do anything
to make me think

780
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:50,079
you enjoy being with me
in a sexual way.

781
01:10:50,113 --> 01:10:51,715
What are you talking about,
Nancy?

782
01:10:51,715 --> 01:10:53,750
Didn't I just give you
flowers and kiss you?

783
01:10:53,883 --> 01:10:55,952
On the cheek, George,
or on the hand.

784
01:10:55,952 --> 01:10:57,354
Never on the mouth.

785
01:10:57,421 --> 01:10:59,423
You do the same things for
me that Corin did.

786
01:10:59,423 --> 01:11:04,127
I am tired of hearing about that
fucking faggot! That little
bitch had it coming.

787
01:11:04,227 --> 01:11:06,430
It's always 'Corin did this,'
or 'Corin did that.'

788
01:11:06,430 --> 01:11:08,932
Well fuck him! He's
dead for a reason!

789
01:11:09,065 --> 01:11:11,535
You don't know
anything about him!

790
01:11:12,702 --> 01:11:16,806
I know I am not - like - him.

791
01:11:16,806 --> 01:11:18,975
You want me to be a man?!

792
01:11:23,079 --> 01:11:27,717
I am not - like - him!

793
01:11:41,831 --> 01:11:42,832
Eli?

794
01:11:48,505 --> 01:11:49,506
Eli?

795
01:12:01,084 --> 01:12:03,319
Oh yeah, Daddy...

796
01:14:12,716 --> 01:14:13,650
Hi.

797
01:14:14,117 --> 01:14:15,251
Hi.

798
01:14:16,486 --> 01:14:18,488
Can we go for a walk?

799
01:14:21,825 --> 01:14:23,893
I should have been
more considerate.

800
01:14:23,893 --> 01:14:25,795
No. No, Eli.

801
01:14:26,262 --> 01:14:29,633
I should never have acted out
at you like that.

802
01:14:29,633 --> 01:14:31,901
Especially in front of
other people.

803
01:14:33,102 --> 01:14:36,606
I'm just having a very hard
time of things lately.

804
01:14:38,608 --> 01:14:42,078
I sometimes hear
voices in my head.

805
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:50,987
What are they saying?

806
01:14:50,987 --> 01:14:53,623
Nothing. Nothing, really.

807
01:14:53,623 --> 01:14:56,192
Not to go out and kill anyone or
anything like that.

808
01:14:57,293 --> 01:14:59,763
But I just...

809
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:05,535
I - sometimes I
think I hear Elliot.

810
01:15:11,875 --> 01:15:14,110
Do you think it's because
of the drinking?

811
01:15:14,944 --> 01:15:20,016
No...No. I drink to
stop the voices.

812
01:15:25,855 --> 01:15:29,659
Well - what about therapy?

813
01:15:29,659 --> 01:15:32,395
Hah! Absolutely not!

814
01:15:32,395 --> 01:15:35,865
If my mother found out...?
No - no...no.

815
01:15:35,899 --> 01:15:38,668
We don't do that kind of
thing in our family.

816
01:15:39,235 --> 01:15:42,305
I've already lost most of
her respect anyway.

817
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:52,749
The thing is, Eli, I am only
peaceful when I am with you.

818
01:15:55,051 --> 01:15:58,688
Sometimes I feel that I am
coming to think

819
01:15:58,688 --> 01:16:01,691
of you as a
replacement for my son,

820
01:16:01,691 --> 01:16:05,194
and I don't want that to go to
a dangerous place.

821
01:16:09,232 --> 01:16:13,069
But there's something else,
something Marti just told me.

822
01:16:13,436 --> 01:16:14,403
What?

823
01:16:15,204 --> 01:16:17,607
The reason she left so
abruptly was...

824
01:16:17,607 --> 01:16:18,775
Hi.

825
01:16:20,109 --> 01:16:20,944
Mom?

826
01:16:21,210 --> 01:16:24,013
I was just driving bye so I
thought I would stop.

827
01:16:24,013 --> 01:16:25,448
Who's your friend here?

828
01:16:25,448 --> 01:16:27,416
This is Emily. She's my boss.

829
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:28,918
Oh, you're boss.

830
01:16:29,686 --> 01:16:32,288
This is my mom...Hillary.

831
01:16:32,856 --> 01:16:34,590
How do you do?

832
01:16:35,391 --> 01:16:38,561
You've raised a
wonderful young man.

833
01:16:38,561 --> 01:16:39,763
Have I?

834
01:16:41,064 --> 01:16:43,466
Can I talk to you for a minute?

835
01:16:49,072 --> 01:16:50,439
What was that?!

836
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:52,075
Nothing.

837
01:16:52,108 --> 01:16:53,409
What do you mean, 'Nothing.'

838
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:54,744
You're holding the woman's hand.

839
01:16:54,778 --> 01:16:56,445
That's not 'Nothing!'

840
01:16:56,479 --> 01:16:58,447
I'm just showing her some
support, Mother.

841
01:16:58,915 --> 01:17:00,650
She really needs it right now.

842
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:03,653
Besides, this is none of your
business. Go home!

843
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:06,222
I am not leaving without you.

844
01:17:07,256 --> 01:17:09,558
Don't try and act like a
mother to me now.

845
01:17:09,893 --> 01:17:11,895
Grandpa took care of those
duties for you.

846
01:17:11,895 --> 01:17:13,596
Well Thank You for that.

847
01:17:13,897 --> 01:17:18,968
Now look - I have been through a
hell of a lot in my life,
just like you.

848
01:17:19,669 --> 01:17:21,404
You keep trying to avoid me.

849
01:17:21,404 --> 01:17:24,240
You keep trying to cut me out of
your life, but guess what?

850
01:17:24,941 --> 01:17:28,845
One day you're going to wake up
to the realization
that you need me,

851
01:17:28,845 --> 01:17:32,248
and that I will help steer your
life in a positive direction.

852
01:17:32,315 --> 01:17:34,117
I don't need you.

853
01:17:34,117 --> 01:17:38,287
Oh yes you do. Everybody
needs a mother.

854
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:42,926
Everybody needs a June Cleaver.
Not a Courtney Love.

855
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:56,605
So, his son says that they were
together. Is there any reason
to doubt that alibi?

856
01:17:56,672 --> 01:18:00,643
No. If Eli's backing him up then
I guess it had to be
somebody else.

857
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:03,146
Is there anyone else who would
pull this kind of prank on you?

858
01:18:03,146 --> 01:18:08,184
Prank?! Are you serious? Since
when is digging up a
corpse a prank?

859
01:18:08,184 --> 01:18:12,055
Uh, ma'am, there was no
coffin in your pond.

860
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:13,790
Nancy?!

861
01:18:15,859 --> 01:18:17,293
It's okay.

862
01:18:18,828 --> 01:18:20,296
Are you alright?

863
01:18:20,296 --> 01:18:21,530
No.

864
01:18:21,664 --> 01:18:23,666
We're going to have three patrol
cars keeping watch

865
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:25,668
throughout the neighborhood for
the entire evening.

866
01:18:26,135 --> 01:18:28,204
I could stay with you.

867
01:18:29,038 --> 01:18:30,173
Okay.

868
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:33,409
Alright. You have my personal
number and if you have any

869
01:18:33,476 --> 01:18:36,245
needs I can have an officer at
your door within a
matter of minutes.

870
01:18:36,245 --> 01:18:37,847
Thank you, Lieutenant.

871
01:18:38,681 --> 01:18:39,916
Thank you.

872
01:18:48,925 --> 01:18:51,560
Are you sure you're comfortable
with me staying here?

873
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:53,429
I don't know.

874
01:18:53,897 --> 01:18:56,833
But if you try anything, they'll
know you're the guy.

875
01:20:06,836 --> 01:20:09,072
I need to use the little boys'
room.

876
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:22,285
Who is it?

877
01:20:22,285 --> 01:20:23,819
Lieutenant Dickertson.

878
01:20:42,105 --> 01:20:43,272
George!

879
01:20:45,875 --> 01:20:47,043
George!

880
01:20:47,977 --> 01:20:48,978
George!!!

881
01:20:52,615 --> 01:20:55,985
Eli! What are you doing here?!
Come on.

882
01:20:55,985 --> 01:20:59,122
I was expecting Marti for dinner
but she still hasn't
shown up yet.

883
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:03,059
I came to say goodbye.

884
01:21:04,193 --> 01:21:05,161
Goodbye?

885
01:21:06,295 --> 01:21:07,796
I have to leave.

886
01:21:08,731 --> 01:21:09,698
Here.

887
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:10,833
No.

888
01:21:11,234 --> 01:21:13,002
You can't leave.

889
01:21:13,002 --> 01:21:18,841
Yes, Emily. I have to. It's
best for both of us.

890
01:21:18,841 --> 01:21:24,013
No, Eli...You're the only one
who makes the pain go away.

891
01:21:24,013 --> 01:21:27,716
You're...You're the only one
who stops the voices!

892
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:31,054
No. No no. I cause
the voices, Emily.

893
01:21:31,487 --> 01:21:32,922
I cause the voices.

894
01:21:32,922 --> 01:21:34,857
No! No no...

895
01:21:36,092 --> 01:21:41,230
Before I met you, I was going
to take my own life.

896
01:21:41,864 --> 01:21:44,700
Without you here, Eli, I
will...I will.

897
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:46,035
No! No! No! No!

898
01:21:46,035 --> 01:21:47,903
I will - I will!!

899
01:21:48,938 --> 01:21:49,905
Emily!

900
01:21:50,406 --> 01:21:51,374
Oh no...No...

901
01:21:51,374 --> 01:21:54,577
You're a wonderful woman...
You're wonderful!

902
01:21:54,777 --> 01:21:57,346
You're wonderful...
and I love you -

903
01:21:57,846 --> 01:22:01,184
but I hate you for making me
love you this much.

904
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:07,723
No. No - you're not leaving me!
No...no...

905
01:22:10,293 --> 01:22:13,196
Emily...It's okay.

906
01:22:13,862 --> 01:22:15,064
Oh no...

907
01:22:15,364 --> 01:22:16,765
I love you.

908
01:22:19,302 --> 01:22:20,536
Okay.

909
01:22:22,071 --> 01:22:23,872
Elliot please!!!

910
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:27,310
Emily...Elliot is dead,
Emily - He is dead!!!

911
01:22:27,310 --> 01:22:30,746
I am not him... I AM NOT HIM!!!

912
01:22:31,314 --> 01:22:34,150
No...No... NO!!!

913
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:38,887
He's gone!

914
01:22:39,122 --> 01:22:40,089
Well where did he go?

915
01:22:40,089 --> 01:22:41,657
He didn't just get up
and walk away.

916
01:22:45,228 --> 01:22:47,163
...And you have no idea
where the body is?

917
01:22:47,163 --> 01:22:48,797
You walked out there with me.

918
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:51,167
I don't understand why you
won't call the cops.

919
01:22:51,167 --> 01:22:53,002
Because I'm not going
to keep running.

920
01:22:53,002 --> 01:22:55,504
Whoever's trying to get at me is
going to come back,

921
01:22:55,504 --> 01:22:58,174
and all the police will do is
show up after the fact.

922
01:22:58,174 --> 01:23:00,809
I'm going to face this asshole
head on and end it.

923
01:23:00,809 --> 01:23:02,478
I'm not going to be some
dumb bitch who

924
01:23:02,478 --> 01:23:04,580
waits around to get
knifed in the shower.

925
01:23:05,081 --> 01:23:07,183
Can we prepare for
battle over dinner?

926
01:23:07,183 --> 01:23:09,352
How can you think of food at
a time like this?

927
01:23:09,418 --> 01:23:10,919
Well, he's not going to
try to kill you

928
01:23:10,986 --> 01:23:12,688
in the middle of a restaurant
and I'm starving.

929
01:23:12,688 --> 01:23:17,326
So either we go to the police
station or we go to get
something to eat.

930
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:23,366
Don't hang up.

931
01:23:23,366 --> 01:23:25,868
I just want you to hear me out,
honey. Okay?

932
01:23:26,435 --> 01:23:30,706
I need to be your mother more
than you need me to be yours.

933
01:23:31,274 --> 01:23:34,310
I just really need a chance to
prove myself to you.

934
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:36,979
You know, I don't need to hear
about how young you were,

935
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:38,547
or how selfish you were,

936
01:23:38,547 --> 01:23:40,849
or how many men you needed
to put before me.

937
01:23:40,883 --> 01:23:42,485
That part - it's all done...
okay?

938
01:23:42,985 --> 01:23:45,188
We're just going to start fresh.

939
01:23:45,288 --> 01:23:48,057
You've got to let me knock
down this wall.

940
01:23:48,124 --> 01:23:50,726
How are you ever going to
understand where I've been,

941
01:23:50,793 --> 01:23:53,829
or why I've done the things that
I've done for the last
several years.

942
01:23:53,829 --> 01:23:58,067
I know what it's like to be
fucked over by everybody
in your life -

943
01:23:58,234 --> 01:24:00,403
and by everything in your life.

944
01:24:00,803 --> 01:24:02,538
So I understand that.

945
01:24:02,538 --> 01:24:05,040
I just want to help you
break your cycle.

946
01:24:05,508 --> 01:24:09,378
I need you to stop replacing
people that love you

947
01:24:09,412 --> 01:24:12,748
with these really shitty
imitations of people.

948
01:24:16,252 --> 01:24:18,354
Just remember, honey.

949
01:24:18,354 --> 01:24:21,190
There's never been a moment
where I haven't loved you.

950
01:24:22,258 --> 01:24:23,226
Yeah.

951
01:24:26,262 --> 01:24:29,998
I'll meet you at Henry &
Wanda's at 6:30.

952
01:24:29,998 --> 01:24:32,735
Okay. Bye.

953
01:24:44,046 --> 01:24:45,781
I'm going to get
something from the bar.

954
01:24:45,781 --> 01:24:46,882
What do you want to drink?

955
01:24:46,882 --> 01:24:50,085
Something strong. Johnny
Red on the rocks.

956
01:24:55,258 --> 01:24:56,525
Nancy?

957
01:24:56,592 --> 01:24:58,361
Oh - Hi.

958
01:24:58,361 --> 01:25:02,131
I just wanted to apologize for
my entrance the other day.

959
01:25:02,298 --> 01:25:03,399
That's fine.

960
01:25:03,399 --> 01:25:05,601
I don't necessarily want to see
my ex-husband either.

961
01:25:06,101 --> 01:25:07,069
Who?

962
01:25:07,102 --> 01:25:08,070
George.

963
01:25:09,205 --> 01:25:10,373
Who's George?

964
01:25:10,373 --> 01:25:12,040
Your ex-husband.

965
01:25:12,375 --> 01:25:14,310
I've never been married.

966
01:25:14,777 --> 01:25:16,212
Eli's father.

967
01:25:16,545 --> 01:25:17,880
Who's Eli?

968
01:25:18,647 --> 01:25:19,982
Your son...

969
01:25:20,048 --> 01:25:21,650
My son's name is Mark.

970
01:25:21,650 --> 01:25:23,586
But his grandfather's
name is Eli.

971
01:25:23,586 --> 01:25:24,620
His grandfather?

972
01:25:25,154 --> 01:25:29,558
Yeah. He's the man who took care
of him, but... he's been
dead for years.

973
01:25:29,792 --> 01:25:31,494
That's it!!!

974
01:25:55,484 --> 01:25:57,820
I'll slit your throat if
you fuck with me!

975
01:26:01,824 --> 01:26:03,158
Mom!

976
01:26:06,495 --> 01:26:08,096
Mom! Mom!

977
01:26:13,536 --> 01:26:16,038
The police are on their
way right now!

978
01:26:22,545 --> 01:26:24,947
Everything was just fine until
that bitch showed up!

979
01:26:25,348 --> 01:26:26,515
Nothing can ever be easy.

980
01:26:26,515 --> 01:26:28,951
It was all so perfect
in California!

981
01:26:35,691 --> 01:26:37,793
Fucker!!! You fucker!!!

982
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:44,533
You can fight me all you want
but you are not going to win!

983
01:26:44,533 --> 01:26:46,335
Let go of me!!

984
01:26:46,369 --> 01:26:48,537
I am so much stronger than you
ever thought I was,

985
01:26:48,571 --> 01:26:50,239
and you gave me
complete control.

986
01:26:50,306 --> 01:26:52,841
Now you deal with
the consequences!!

987
01:26:58,180 --> 01:27:00,316
No!!!

988
01:27:25,374 --> 01:27:29,177
It's about time you showed up
and did some work.

989
01:27:31,246 --> 01:27:35,017
Come. Give daddy a big kiss...

990
01:27:43,025 --> 01:27:44,393
Richard?!

991
01:27:48,196 --> 01:27:50,766
So you do remember my name.

992
01:27:50,966 --> 01:27:53,369
Did our son ever know it?

993
01:27:53,602 --> 01:27:54,570
Eli?!

994
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:56,639
I told you to stay away.

995
01:27:59,442 --> 01:28:05,147
Oh. Haven't you made an
appropriate
introduction to your boss?

996
01:28:06,214 --> 01:28:09,485
Emily...meet Mark.

997
01:28:12,821 --> 01:28:13,422
Hey.

998
01:28:13,556 --> 01:28:14,122
Hey...

999
01:28:14,122 --> 01:28:15,791
He's my whore.

1000
01:28:17,059 --> 01:28:20,596
Pick up a talentless starving
artist in West Hollywood,

1001
01:28:20,629 --> 01:28:25,901
and offer him $25,000 so he can
chase after that
bottomless dream,

1002
01:28:25,901 --> 01:28:28,771
and he'll turn even bigger
tricks for you than he did...

1003
01:28:30,305 --> 01:28:32,508
You know... I don't know.

1004
01:28:32,941 --> 01:28:38,947
Exactly how many fat old men
have pounded that ass
for $150 a night?

1005
01:28:38,947 --> 01:28:41,083
You gave it to me for
at least a year.

1006
01:28:41,083 --> 01:28:42,117
Fuck you!

1007
01:28:42,117 --> 01:28:43,686
Is it true?!

1008
01:28:44,753 --> 01:28:45,688
Why?

1009
01:28:46,121 --> 01:28:48,791
Because he told me what you
did to his son,

1010
01:28:48,824 --> 01:28:51,494
but I didn't think it would
end up like this!

1011
01:28:51,494 --> 01:28:52,961
Oh, you're right there!

1012
01:28:53,529 --> 01:28:57,866
If your fucking mother hadn't
stepped in and put her face
in our business.

1013
01:28:58,100 --> 01:29:04,172
Oh, of course, she's just a
junkie looser trying to make it
right with her queer kid.

1014
01:29:04,172 --> 01:29:07,109
At least I'm not living a lie.
Come on, man.

1015
01:29:07,342 --> 01:29:10,513
Telling everyone I'm your son,
instead of your...

1016
01:29:11,046 --> 01:29:13,782
well, I guess the right
word isn't lover.

1017
01:29:13,782 --> 01:29:18,721
Over 30 years since you left
your wife, and you're still
fucking hiding!

1018
01:29:18,721 --> 01:29:21,957
I HAD to run away! You don't
know what my life was like!!

1019
01:29:21,990 --> 01:29:23,859
I lost my family because of it!!

1020
01:29:23,892 --> 01:29:25,661
You ran away, Richard!

1021
01:29:25,661 --> 01:29:26,529
Fuck you!!!

1022
01:29:26,529 --> 01:29:27,496
You ran away!!!

1023
01:29:28,163 --> 01:29:30,899
I tried to find you and
you hid yourself.

1024
01:29:30,899 --> 01:29:33,502
But I did it for him...

1025
01:29:34,803 --> 01:29:40,375
No...no... noooooo!!!

1026
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:45,013
Oh my God... How could you
do this to him?!

1027
01:29:45,347 --> 01:29:48,183
I'm just giving him what
he died for...

1028
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:53,422
to be held in that -
man's - arms...

1029
01:29:53,489 --> 01:29:58,026
No...if you loved him you would
have let him rest.

1030
01:29:58,026 --> 01:30:01,997
If I loved him?! THIS is
all about love!

1031
01:30:01,997 --> 01:30:06,101
Look who deserted him when he
needed them the most!
His boss...

1032
01:30:06,101 --> 01:30:08,737
I'm giving you a chance to leave
on your own terms...

1033
01:30:08,871 --> 01:30:10,038
His friend...

1034
01:30:11,707 --> 01:30:13,442
His fiancee...

1035
01:30:13,442 --> 01:30:15,410
Why are you doing this to me?!

1036
01:30:15,678 --> 01:30:17,713
His fucking mother...

1037
01:30:19,347 --> 01:30:21,383
This is about love...

1038
01:30:21,784 --> 01:30:24,352
You don't know
anything about love.

1039
01:30:24,352 --> 01:30:29,224
Oh don't I? I brought him back
to the house he was born in.

1040
01:30:29,858 --> 01:30:32,928
My key still works.
Isn't that funny?

1041
01:30:33,228 --> 01:30:36,031
Couldn't part with the family
property, could ya?

1042
01:30:36,599 --> 01:30:38,601
Oh, let me guess, Emily.

1043
01:30:38,634 --> 01:30:41,470
You were just holding out for
the highest bidder.

1044
01:30:41,537 --> 01:30:42,938
That's what you always did...

1045
01:30:42,971 --> 01:30:48,143
waiting for the best, as long as
the best came with a big
- fat - check!

1046
01:30:48,911 --> 01:30:52,314
Oh, that's what love has
always been to Emily.

1047
01:30:52,314 --> 01:30:56,919
Of course it must be so much
more painful for you,
right Mark?

1048
01:30:57,419 --> 01:31:00,623
At least it wasn't our mother's
who abandoned us...

1049
01:31:00,723 --> 01:31:02,791
Like how you abandoned Elliot?

1050
01:31:02,791 --> 01:31:08,430
Shut up!!! You want love? You
could've had it from me.

1051
01:31:08,931 --> 01:31:11,600
You didn't want it, did you?

1052
01:31:11,967 --> 01:31:16,639
You just wanted the paycheck
like everyone else.

1053
01:31:17,472 --> 01:31:20,743
Oh but you'll love 'this,'
won't you?!

1054
01:31:31,587 --> 01:31:35,190
Don't you just want
to squeeze him...?

1055
01:31:35,624 --> 01:31:38,160
And tickle him...?

1056
01:31:40,162 --> 01:31:41,764
And kiss him?

1057
01:31:44,032 --> 01:31:47,803
Leave - him - alone...

1058
01:31:48,436 --> 01:31:51,840
He's just so...perfect...

1059
01:32:00,482 --> 01:32:04,452
Did you tell him you loved him,
like you said it to me?!

1060
01:32:04,519 --> 01:32:06,054
You paid me.

1061
01:32:06,521 --> 01:32:08,991
You stop this right now,
Richard!!

1062
01:32:08,991 --> 01:32:10,726
Oh, you're right there, Emily.

1063
01:32:10,826 --> 01:32:13,195
So I guess I need to
kill everyone.

1064
01:32:13,228 --> 01:32:14,830
I thought I would set it up...

1065
01:32:14,830 --> 01:32:16,699
and make it look like you
committed suicide...

1066
01:32:16,699 --> 01:32:17,966
like you did the deed.

1067
01:32:17,966 --> 01:32:18,567
No...

1068
01:32:19,334 --> 01:32:21,236
It worked when I killed Jake.

1069
01:32:25,574 --> 01:32:31,847
He didn't want to die. But he
had the option
between him and you.

1070
01:32:32,514 --> 01:32:35,350
It seems he actually
cared about you.

1071
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:38,587
Oh, and he even wrote his
own suicide note.

1072
01:32:38,687 --> 01:32:42,725
Of course, I was holding a
gun to his head.

1073
01:32:43,225 --> 01:32:47,395
Too bad I'm not holding up my
part of the bargain.

1074
01:32:47,429 --> 01:32:48,430
Make me!!

1075
01:32:49,331 --> 01:32:53,501
Don't you bitches get it?
Everything was a set up.

1076
01:32:53,902 --> 01:32:59,842
And you told us exactly what we
needed to know to get
inside your heads.

1077
01:32:59,842 --> 01:33:01,910
My son used to play the piano.

1078
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:03,912
What? You don't like
white roses?

1079
01:33:03,912 --> 01:33:06,949
What I really need is someone
around here with a personality.

1080
01:33:07,716 --> 01:33:09,117
Stop it!

1081
01:33:11,954 --> 01:33:13,588
No!

1082
01:33:27,970 --> 01:33:29,571
Richard!!!

1083
01:33:34,943 --> 01:33:36,712
I'm sorry.

1084
01:33:54,462 --> 01:33:55,831
The cars!

1085
01:34:06,508 --> 01:34:09,244
What are you doing? He probably
has the keys on him.

1086
01:34:09,244 --> 01:34:11,446
I'm gonna beat that
mother fucker's ass.

1087
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:13,849
He's gotta have
something else in here.

1088
01:34:14,182 --> 01:34:16,018
Go look in the other cars.

1089
01:34:27,830 --> 01:34:30,098
Marti, where have you been?

1090
01:34:30,265 --> 01:34:33,936
I had to leave... I...
I was pregnant.

1091
01:34:35,003 --> 01:34:36,939
Elliot has a son.

1092
01:34:39,341 --> 01:34:40,275
Gotcha!

1093
01:34:41,343 --> 01:34:42,610
Where is he?

1094
01:34:43,178 --> 01:34:45,013
My brother's been raising him.

1095
01:34:49,317 --> 01:34:50,318
Find anything?

1096
01:34:50,318 --> 01:34:51,319
No!

1097
01:35:01,663 --> 01:35:03,031
Hello?

1098
01:35:03,398 --> 01:35:04,967
No, she's not here.

1099
01:35:09,671 --> 01:35:11,206
Yes! We need the police!

1100
01:35:11,907 --> 01:35:12,875
Richard!

1101
01:35:15,878 --> 01:35:16,845
Richard!!!

1102
01:35:18,513 --> 01:35:20,515
Come out you coward!!!

1103
01:35:22,851 --> 01:35:25,587
I am tired of you running away!

1104
01:35:25,888 --> 01:35:27,322
FACE ME!!!!

1105
01:35:39,367 --> 01:35:41,103
Come on, Emily.

1106
01:35:41,169 --> 01:35:43,038
You've always got
something to say.

1107
01:35:43,071 --> 01:35:46,208
If you had told me the
truth when we met,

1108
01:35:46,374 --> 01:35:48,777
we wouldn't be here like this!

1109
01:35:55,517 --> 01:35:56,785
Enough.

1110
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:00,022
Give me the knife.

1111
01:36:00,555 --> 01:36:01,523
No.

1112
01:36:02,390 --> 01:36:04,392
I'll give you double
what I offered.

1113
01:36:04,860 --> 01:36:07,195
Think what $50,000
could do for you!

1114
01:36:08,964 --> 01:36:12,600
Nothing - compared to what this
woman has done for me.

1115
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:14,702
What? What - she made
you feel loved?

1116
01:36:14,903 --> 01:36:16,872
Is that it? Is that the magic?

1117
01:36:17,806 --> 01:36:19,808
You're just a soulless
little Hollywood whore.

1118
01:36:19,808 --> 01:36:21,977
Remember that. No emotion.

1119
01:36:21,977 --> 01:36:25,380
Right. I'm a whore.

1120
01:36:26,714 --> 01:36:30,318
But this woman has shown me more
love than you'll
ever understand.

1121
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:33,989
You told me you loved me.

1122
01:36:34,990 --> 01:36:36,758
You paid me.

1123
01:36:48,670 --> 01:36:51,673
You realize neither of us is
getting out of this.

1124
01:36:51,739 --> 01:36:53,308
The police are on their way.

1125
01:36:53,308 --> 01:36:54,576
We'll help you get through this.

1126
01:36:54,576 --> 01:36:59,347
It's alright, Mark. He is not
going to hurt anyone else.

1127
01:37:00,482 --> 01:37:02,851
Thank you. For everything.

1128
01:37:03,451 --> 01:37:07,956
You've been ripping my insides
out ever since I first
got in your car.

1129
01:37:15,597 --> 01:37:19,167
Oh my... oh Mark...

1130
01:37:19,167 --> 01:37:22,837
Oh baby...oh baby...oh baby...

1131
01:37:33,348 --> 01:37:35,317
Reach in my pocket.

1132
01:37:46,828 --> 01:37:49,664
Give it to somebody who -
who deserves it.

1133
01:38:02,410 --> 01:38:05,513
I'm tired... I'm tired.

1134
01:38:06,348 --> 01:38:07,715
Let us go.

1135
01:38:10,018 --> 01:38:12,554
No...no...

1136
01:38:12,554 --> 01:38:14,256
Let us go.

1137
01:38:15,323 --> 01:38:18,560
Oh...no...no...

1138
01:38:45,287 --> 01:38:49,091
Returning to a story which has
reached almost
mythical proportions,

1139
01:38:49,091 --> 01:38:51,126
Emily Hamilton,
mother of slain...

1140
01:38:51,126 --> 01:38:53,861
...mother of slain gay
martyr Elliot Hamilton,

1141
01:38:53,861 --> 01:38:55,730
revealed today that her
son fathered...

1142
01:38:55,730 --> 01:38:58,266
...fathered a child with his
then fiancee, Marti White.

1143
01:38:58,266 --> 01:39:01,103
Marti White fled the city once
her case was thrown
out of court...

1144
01:39:01,103 --> 01:39:03,771
...out of court, back in
November of 2005.

1145
01:39:03,771 --> 01:39:05,773
She claims she hid the child's
existence from her

1146
01:39:05,773 --> 01:39:08,576
family and friends because of
shame for herself,

1147
01:39:08,576 --> 01:39:10,478
and for not wanting the child to
grow up under public scrutiny.

1148
01:39:10,478 --> 01:39:11,779
the child to grow up under
public scrutiny.

1149
01:39:11,779 --> 01:39:14,049
I don't know why I do the
things that I do...

1150
01:39:14,049 --> 01:39:16,084
why I hurt those around me,

1151
01:39:16,084 --> 01:39:19,387
when they've done nothing
particularly wrong
directly to me.

1152
01:39:19,954 --> 01:39:23,958
Perhaps I try to justify my
actions by thinking they
do deserve it...

1153
01:39:23,958 --> 01:39:26,894
...payback for everything
they've ever done to
hurt others -

1154
01:39:26,961 --> 01:39:28,997
consciously or not.

1155
01:39:29,764 --> 01:39:32,434
I think it's really because I
feel dead inside -

1156
01:39:33,068 --> 01:39:36,004
like I'm constantly living in
the month of November.

1157
01:39:36,304 --> 01:39:41,143
Cold. Lifeless. Nothing to
offer. Sometimes I think...

1158
01:39:41,176 --> 01:39:44,146
...sometimes I think I even
like it that way.

1159
01:39:44,179 --> 01:39:48,150
I once heard someone say you
should appreciate what
God gives you,

1160
01:39:48,183 --> 01:39:51,119
because he could take it
away at any moment,

1161
01:39:51,119 --> 01:39:55,523
and you'll have lost it forever.
I don't care.

1162
01:39:55,757 --> 01:39:58,426
The only thing He can
take is my life,

1163
01:39:58,793 --> 01:40:01,129
and that wouldn't be
much of a loss.

1164
01:40:01,463 --> 01:40:05,367
I don't even know if I
believe in Him anymore.

1165
01:40:09,037 --> 01:40:10,838
It is a loss.

1166
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:15,443
The voices have gone now, Mark.
