1
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:02,208
Mr. Elliot would gladly pay for
honor of playing in Japan.

2
00:10:22,662 --> 00:10:27,466
Architecture beautiful. Society on
cutting edge of progress.

3
00:13:34,622 --> 00:13:35,656
How they hung?

4
00:13:36,991 --> 00:13:39,060
Wow! A world series ring.

5
00:13:54,275 --> 00:13:55,643
Jackass!

6
00:15:02,344 --> 00:15:05,313
By the way, what is his order
in batting?

7
00:15:19,895 --> 00:15:23,966
The spirit of baseball in Japan
is the same as in America.

8
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:56,799
He welcomes all advice from most
honorable manager.

9
00:16:00,102 --> 00:16:01,570
Okay.

10
00:20:50,895 --> 00:20:52,497
Thank you very much.

11
00:21:06,645 --> 00:21:08,280

12
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:17,977
Oh Man! My aching back!

13
00:24:17,504 --> 00:24:19,673
It's like jerking off before sex.
Ball seems to be flying well.

14
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,381
GOOD LUCK.

15
00:33:08,807 --> 00:33:11,309
Turn up your radio - It's Elliot.

16
00:33:18,783 --> 00:33:19,818
What was that!

17
00:33:26,224 --> 00:33:28,460
Front foot in, hand over.

18
00:33:36,168 --> 00:33:37,169
Way to go!

19
00:38:52,186 --> 00:38:53,721
Way to go!

20
00:39:13,675 --> 00:39:15,410
Be quiet!

21
00:39:15,844 --> 00:39:17,012
Concentrate.

22
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:58,581
When the game is over
a fat lasy will sing to us.

23
00:40:58,848 --> 00:41:00,349
Let's go!

24
00:42:55,399 --> 00:42:57,200
He is becoming an
embarrassment to us.

25
00:42:57,667 --> 00:43:01,071
You do not appear to have
found the answer to the Giants

26
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:04,007
As usual they stand between
us and the pennant.

27
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:06,710
I beg your patience.

28
00:43:07,044 --> 00:43:09,012
Our patience is running out.

29
00:43:09,479 --> 00:43:12,115
And your CONTRACT is running out.

30
00:57:17,101 --> 00:57:18,403
White trash!

31
00:57:43,361 --> 00:57:44,596
What the hell are you thinking of!

32
00:58:52,097 --> 00:58:53,699
Suspend Elliot indefinitely.

33
00:58:54,566 --> 00:58:57,403
And consider yourself out, as soon
as a replacement is found.

34
00:58:57,870 --> 00:59:00,339
You have brought dishonor to team.

35
00:59:04,910 --> 00:59:05,878
Replace the runner

36
00:59:06,211 --> 00:59:08,247
Bring the doctor.

37
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:44,471
I'm home

38
01:01:46,073 --> 01:01:50,277
Grandfather, grandmother, this
is my friend, Mr. Jack Elliot.

39
01:01:51,178 --> 01:01:52,479
We know who this is.

40
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:55,149
You go too far Hiroko.

41
01:02:01,755 --> 01:02:02,706
Where is father?

42
01:02:03,123 --> 01:02:04,658
He is garderning.

43
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:21,108
Is that you Hiroko?

44
01:02:26,046 --> 01:02:27,114
WHAT THE HELL?

45
01:02:27,848 --> 01:02:29,016
Don't be angry.

46
01:02:26,046 --> 01:02:34,021
How could you!

47
01:02:34,421 --> 01:02:36,624
You needed to see another
side of him

48
01:02:39,193 --> 01:02:41,062
This is not for you to decide.

49
01:05:38,474 --> 01:05:40,342
Teach him properly Hiroko.

50
01:06:05,635 --> 01:06:08,304
Why do you always put
people down?

51
01:06:08,504 --> 01:06:09,772
You always do!

52
01:06:10,339 --> 01:06:13,109
And try to fit everybody into
the same mold!

53
01:06:13,342 --> 01:06:14,277
Hiroko. Sit down!

54
01:06:14,644 --> 01:06:17,079
Try a little understanding!

55
01:10:39,377 --> 01:10:42,314
Looks like he's run
out of excuses.

56
01:12:53,646 --> 01:12:54,647
I'm sorry.

57
01:14:06,584 --> 01:14:09,089
Foreigner charming, foreigner romantic.

58
01:14:10,357 --> 01:14:12,993
And foreigner always leave.

59
01:15:21,963 --> 01:15:24,332
I would like to apologize
to you all.

60
01:15:27,068 --> 01:15:28,803
From now, on

61
01:15:29,136 --> 01:15:33,508
I would like to make an effort,

62
01:15:35,376 --> 01:15:38,212
To be a real member
of the team.

63
01:15:38,579 --> 01:15:42,850
And between us
I'd like to build...

64
01:15:44,919 --> 01:15:46,988
...A chopstick

65
01:15:48,523 --> 01:15:51,225
...an edge.

66
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:53,695
...A bridge?

67
01:15:55,096 --> 01:15:56,097
A bridge.

68
01:15:57,165 --> 01:16:01,302
Build a bridge of friendship.

69
01:17:27,456 --> 01:17:29,091
It's only the 5th inning.

70
01:17:29,958 --> 01:17:31,126
Do you know that?

71
01:17:32,961 --> 01:17:34,630
Where's your answer!?

72
01:23:46,238 --> 01:23:50,242
Jack Elliot is challenging
manager Uchiyama's record,

73
01:23:50,476 --> 01:23:52,878
Which was set 18 years ago.

74
01:23:53,245 --> 1:23:57,483
Dragons are very close to winning
the pennant from the Giants.

75
01:23:57,983 --> 01:23:59,885
Isn't that fantastic!

76
01:24:01,854 --> 01:24:03,822
Why are you still here?

77
01:24:04,490 --> 01:24:05,724
I'm Working.

78
01:24:07,126 --> 01:24:09,695
But the game is about to start.
Aren't you going?

79
01:24:10,496 --> 01:24:11,630
No, I'm not.

80
01:24:14,433 --> 01:24:17,369
Foreigner charming, foreigner romantic

81
01:24:18,605 --> 01:24:20,406
Foreigner returning to America.

82
01:24:25,444 --> 01:24:26,545
I'm sorry.

83
01:24:24,813 --> 01:24:28,881
It's okay.

84
01:24:32,451 --> 01:24:33,719
See you!

85
01:24:34,553 --> 01:24:35,721
See you!

86
01:25:05,151 --> 01:25:09,122
Due to the importance of this game

87
01:25:09,789 --> 01:25:14,193
We have a list of strategies
we want followed.

88
01:25:14,661 --> 01:25:17,063
To my knowledge you have not
yet found my replacement

89
01:25:18,164 --> 01:25:19,866
Therefore, I am the manager

90
01:25:21,401 --> 01:25:23,436
I will manage the team.

91
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:29,075
Now excuse me,
I have a job to do.

92
01:25:32,312 --> 01:25:34,081
If Giants win and...

93
01:25:34,214 --> 01:25:36,216
If Uchiyama San loses his record

94
01:25:36,649 --> 01:25:41,488
Dragons will lose face very badly!

95
01:25:47,027 --> 01:25:49,429
I feel good na na na na na na na!

96
01:28:20,782 --> 01:28:22,684
Park it!

97
01:31:07,984 --> 01:31:10,086
He stepped on the plate!

98
01:31:12,555 --> 01:31:15,158
I saw it, he's out!

99
01:32:06,977 --> 01:32:09,412
Giants 5. Dragons 1.
Middle of the 7th.

100
01:32:38,475 --> 01:32:40,010
Rally caps.

101
01:32:46,416 --> 01:32:47,718
Let's go.

102
01:34:59,617 --> 01:35:01,519
Giants 6. Dragons 5.
Two outs.

103
01:35:04,422 --> 01:35:07,559
The bases are loaded...
What will Uchiyama do?

104
01:35:17,269 --> 01:35:19,571
Uchiyama knows who
 pays his salary.

105
01:35:19,921 --> -1:35:21,673
He'll go for the bunt.

106
01:37:25,732 --> 01:37:27,700
WE KICKED ASS!

107
01:37:48,521 --> 01:37:50,790
We have won the pennant.
Thanks to you.

108
01:37:51,291 --> 01:37:53,526
You have brought great honor
to team.

109
01:37:53,693 --> 01:37:56,029
Then you will want me to stay
as manager?

110
01:37:56,663 --> 01:37:57,664
Please.

111
01:38:02,860 --> 01:38:03,827
Thank you.

112
01:39:52,413 --> 01:39:53,681
Can I come in?

113
01:40:10,898 --> 01:40:12,266
Nice place!

114
01:40:17,872 --> 01:40:20,241
I have come on behalf of Jack.

115
01:40:26,981 --> 01:40:28,916
He wants you to know...

116
01:40:32,120 --> 01:40:33,921
He loves you...

117
01:40:37,825 --> 01:40:40,962
And wants to discuss the
future with you...

118
01:40:42,931 --> 01:40:45,233
When your "jet's are cool."

119
01:40:47,635 --> 01:40:49,971
But he's like you, father.

120
01:40:50,839 --> 01:40:52,540
He will not change.

121
01:40:56,144 --> 01:40:58,246
Changes occurring all around

122
01:40:58,813 --> 01:41:01,082
Perhaps you should listen first.

123
01:41:03,985 --> 01:41:05,286
He is...

124
01:41:05,787 --> 01:41:07,622
A foreign ball player

125
01:41:08,023 --> 01:41:10,992
Who you are in love with.

126
01:41:12,827 --> 01:41:14,829
It doesn't matter.

127
01:41:15,897 --> 01:41:17,699
It does matter...

128
01:41:20,235 --> 01:41:22,037
More than anything

129
01:41:22,737 --> 01:41:24,539
Doesn't it?

130
01:41:25,807 --> 01:41:27,509
This is for you.

131
01:41:29,544 --> 01:41:33,682
Very nice of him.
It's not from him, it's from me.

132
01:41:34,816 --> 01:41:36,084
From now on...

133
01:41:38,553 --> 01:41:44,626
I want to speak to you from my
heart with no holding back.

134
01:41:47,796 --> 01:41:49,064
Father.
