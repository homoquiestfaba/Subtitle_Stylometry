1
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,679
Notice of rent increase.
The tenant rent

2
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,759
increase from 60 will go into

3
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,079
effect in fact 30 days from today on

4
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,798
July 1st.

5
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,520
What?

6
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,599
I hope those are groceries in that box.

7
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,398
It's your turn to cook tonight.

8
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:32,078
At this rate I may have to hit my

9
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,319
rolodex for dinner with one of the many

10
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,279
gents seeking my attention.

11
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,039
Jo have you seen this?

12
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,240
Is this some kind of joke?

13
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,798
This has got to be illegal.

14
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,158
Was this on everyone's door?

15
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,959
I didn't even bother to notice.

16
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,078
I was too busy processing us.

17
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,599
Lo.

18
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,519
What happened?

19
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,078
You just got this position.

20
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,078
Budget cuts.

21
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,959
Every position.

22
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,038
Linus, my supervisor, was cut.

23
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,878
Are you sure it's because some beautiful

24
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,039
black girl wasn't trying to force

25
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,199
African art inside the very white

26
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,519
establishment?

27
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,839
I told you Lo, you have to tread lightly

28
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,999
with them folks.
They're not like that.

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,119
Jo.

30
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,279
I had creative control over some

31
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,159
projects and influence in others.

32
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,439
Trust me,

33
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,359
they appreciated what
I brought to the table.

34
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,919
Honey, just because you got invited to

35
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,399
dinner doesn't mean you
have a seat at the table.

36
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,238
You are still the negro in the room and

37
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,079
you bet not dare say a word about it.

38
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,698
Because they'll tell you to stay out of

39
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:54,238
white folks business real quick,

40
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,839
and then they'll make it sound cute.

41
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,158
You know, like budget cuts?

42
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,518
Well excuse me, little miss moneybags.

43
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,299
All you have to do is hit up your folks for

44
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,039
some cash and you'll be right back.

45
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,679
Painting today and writing poetry tomorrow.

46
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,679
No offense, Lo,

47
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,318
but you're still new to this.

48
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,518
Even as far as my family has gotten

49
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,679
white folks will always remind you that

50
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,480
you're still their nigger.

51
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,878
Oh no.

52
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,200
I'm sorry.

53
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,480
I'll figure it out.

54
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,399
Don't worry.

55
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,438
All of this hard work for nothing.

56
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,079
This degree.

57
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,399
Thought I was making a change.

58
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,078
You are.

59
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,797
Making a difference.

60
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,779
It's the same old thing.

61
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,079
I wondered why my boss
was looking at me

62
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,840
like I was an alien today.

63
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,800
It's cause I'm colored, ain't it?

64
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,319
It's the same thing over and
over and over again.

65
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,039
I'm tired, listen.

66
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,759
I'm tired

67
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,159
I'm tired.

68
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,038
Hey baby, how you doing?

69
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,738
I was hoping you were here.
I brought you

70
00:05:12,739 --> 00:05:15,219
- some flowers.
- Oh you didn't have to do that.

71
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,119
You know your sister misses you dearly.

72
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,319
How's work coming along?

73
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,478
Yeah I miss her too and

74
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,039
work has

75
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,999
had a lot of changes.

76
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,319
You want to talk about?

77
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,999
No, I just wanted to bring you some

78
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,279
flowers before I have to get to work.

79
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,279
I should probably get
going before I'm late.

80
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,519
Louise, wait.

81
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,198
You have been working like a mad one.

82
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,399
I don't want you stressing out about us.

83
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,719
I appreciate everything that you have

84
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,599
done and I picked up
a friendship at the laundromat.

85
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,399
So if you can, I would love if you would

86
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,478
- watch your sister.
- But you've already

87
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,279
been watching all day
long mama and the

88
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,198
important thing is that Angela is

89
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,279
clothed and fed and y'all have a roof

90
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,198
over y'all's head and you keeping

91
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,318
healthy right now.
Now another thing,

92
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,999
my word is final.
You give your sister

93
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,039
some quality time.

94
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,840
God will take care of it,
He always does.

95
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,598
Oh good, you made the coffee.

96
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,638
So,

97
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,638
how'd it go?

98
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,360
I couldn't tell her.

99
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,519
So your mom thinks you're
at work right now?

100
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,039
Louise.

101
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:03,679
Look,

102
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,918
I might know about some work.

103
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,679
My Uncle Booker was
at my parent's house

104
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,799
for dinner the other night and

105
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,879
he said he might be
short on waitresses.

106
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,758
You don't have an Uncle Booker.

107
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,918
He's just a friend of Daddy's.
Look he

108
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,519
owns the restaurant on the other side of

109
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,519
Brownsville.

110
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,359
I appreciate it, Jo,
but I don't know the

111
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,959
first thing about being a waitress.

112
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,598
You can just do it for a little while

113
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,839
until you find something

114
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,560
more worthy.

115
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,839
Thank you, Jo.

116
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,719
I'll think about it.

117
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,439
Hi, I'm looking for Mr Booker.

118
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,478
Coco.

119
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,079
You, ready?

120
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,638
Excuse me, I'm looking for Mr Booker.

121
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,519
I'm sorry, no Mr Booker here.

122
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,938
You sure you're in the right place?

123
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:29,059
A friend of mine said you
were looking for waitresses.

124
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,718
Who's your friend?

125
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,558
Josephine Carter.

126
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,999
Jo sent you?

127
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,199
Yeah, we're hiring,
but not for waitresses.

128
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,958
Then what position are you
looking to fill?

129
00:08:47,921 --> 00:08:50,879
Take a look around, sweetheart.

130
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,719
Can you entertain?

131
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,799
You see how Coco is dressed?

132
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,679
You have any idea what she does?

133
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,239
- I can make an educated guess.
- Well, that's the job.

134
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,439
- How much does it pay?
- The pay is good.

135
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,679
Better than any other job

136
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,760
you're going to find

137
00:09:07,761 --> 00:09:09,659
but if you're a friend of Miss Carter,

138
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,240
I don't think you're the right type of

139
00:09:11,241 --> 00:09:14,160
girl for this establishment.

140
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,879
Then maybe you're right.

141
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,200
I'm sorry to bother you.

142
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,278
Look,

143
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,879
baby girl,

144
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,719
if you want it,

145
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,559
the job is yours.

146
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,199
All you have to do is dance.

147
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,719
I don't run no whorehouse.

148
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,519
Whatever the girls decide to do in their

149
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,119
free time it's none of my business.
Okay?

150
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,479
Okay.

151
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,079
Name.

152
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,999
Louise.

153
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,919
Lola.

154
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,039
Lola.

155
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,480
All right. Come by tomorrow night.

156
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,679
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for our

157
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,800
favorite dancer, Coco!

158
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,759
You ready Lola?
You're on half of the interlude.

159
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,119
I know.

160
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,999
- Uh Lola...
- Give her a second.
- Let's go!

161
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,600
Two minutes, let's go! Move it!

162
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,799
Just have fun with it.
Remember, you're in

163
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,599
control out there.

164
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,919
It's a special day in the club because

165
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,999
we have a new name.

166
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,759
Please give it up,

167
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,559
a warm welcome for the

168
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,040
one and only, Lola.

169
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,879
So, how do you feel?
How was it?

170
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,958
Uh

171
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,398
It's different.

172
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,618
Different the way you thought

173
00:11:05,619 --> 00:11:06,958
or expected?

174
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,439
Different for me.

175
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,759
How long have you been doing this?

176
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,759
About a year.

177
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,599
Pictures for eight months.

178
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,359
Pictures?

179
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,439
Yeah, you know photos so clients can have

180
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,518
a keepsake collection.
Posters, things like that.

181
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,280
They pay a lot of money
for that kind of thing?

182
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,559
Loads especially, if you do custom scenes.

183
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,679
Really?

184
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,679
I'd like to do that someday.

185
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,559
Then I can spend more time with my Penny.

186
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,078
Penny?

187
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,119
- Are you a mother?
- Yeah.

188
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,920
Penny's my daughter.

189
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,480
what do you do it for?

190
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,519
Freedom.

191
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,078
What the hell are you wearing?

192
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,278
I just got home from work.

193
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,439
What are you doing up this late?

194
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,838
I just got in from a date.

195
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,078
Is that your uniform for
serving down at Bookers?

196
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,319
A part of my uniform.

197
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,680
Well, how was your first day?

198
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,239
Jo,

199
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,479
this uncle of yours

200
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,759
doesn't own a restaurant.

201
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,199
Then where the hell have you been,

202
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,398
for the past five hours?

203
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,719
He owns a burlesque club,

204
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,078
and I'm one of his dancers.

205
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,039
What the devil!

206
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,159
You tell him today is your last day!

207
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,719
- This cannot continue.
- I told him I'm coming back.

208
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,719
What!

209
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,679
Have you lost your mind?

210
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,439
What if the fellas from the social club

211
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,398
see you down there?

212
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,479
What if someone from church sees you?

213
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,999
Then what?

214
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,879
I tell them how much I charge for a dance.

215
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,360
- What you doing?
- This arrived for you.

216
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,559
Look at that!

217
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,690
They're incredible.

218
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,759
Look at your legs.

219
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,479
They printed them.

220
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,120
Oh my gosh!

221
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,800
They want you for Wildplay magazine.

222
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,359
I know it's been a whirlwind week for

223
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,880
you, but I think you should take it.

224
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,719
So you gonna take it?

225
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,958
You know what's so funny?

226
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,679
I called the electricity
to see when it was due.

227
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,638
And they said that you
paid the whole thing.

228
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,920
You have some explaining to do.

229
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,758
What's going on, Louise?

230
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,758
What do you mean?

231
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,160
Aren't you happy?

232
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,638
Mama.

233
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,999
I don't work for the Institute anymore.

234
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,518
I lost my job a few days ago.

235
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:52,719
Well.

236
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,119
Where did the money come from

237
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,559
and the groceries?

238
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,479
Jo got me a job down at Mr Booker's.

239
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,360
Doing what exactly?

240
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,518
Louise.

241
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,999
- This is our -
-  It's me, Mama.

242
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,278
This is freedom.

243
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,679
This opened up doors to everything

244
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,838
I ever wanted.

245
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,758
And mostly

246
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,360
to keep my promise to you.

247
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,039
So.

248
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,359
Now what, baby?

249
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,170
