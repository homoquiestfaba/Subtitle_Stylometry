1
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,450
Han!

2
00:03:53,955 --> 00:03:56,435
Hello man.
Welcome to the D.R.

3
00:03:57,092 --> 00:03:58,603
Put your suitcase in back here.

4
00:05:36,334 --> 00:05:37,419
'Sup Boss!

5
00:05:39,824 --> 00:05:40,870
I bring you something.

6
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,214
Can you explain to me
who is the Chinese guy?

7
00:06:03,657 --> 00:06:05,513
Looks like you have been really
moving up in the world.

8
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:08,736
Who's this guy?

9
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:21,361
Santo, Han.
Han, Santo.

10
00:06:24,644 --> 00:06:27,491
- You look like shit.
- That is a lot coming from you.

11
00:06:28,728 --> 00:06:30,506
How come we can't stay in a hotel, huh?

12
00:06:30,653 --> 00:06:32,626
Oh, complaining already!

13
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,419
I like air-conditioning, you know?
And room service.

14
00:06:35,494 --> 00:06:37,315
- So, you guys love each other.
- With TV!

15
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,381
Dig in.

16
00:07:24,372 --> 00:07:26,561
Welcome to our island, Han.

17
00:07:26,944 --> 00:07:28,992
Island in paradise.

18
00:07:35,384 --> 00:07:37,506
Tonight we go speak to Elvis.

19
00:07:38,482 --> 00:07:40,230
See if we can fix this problem.

20
00:07:40,301 --> 00:07:43,542
- First we pick up Leo.
- Leo?

21
00:07:49,651 --> 00:07:53,069
So where are we actually picking
up this Leo friend of yours?

22
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,172
Prison.

23
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,309
Yo! My God!
Move! Move, man!

24
00:08:12,246 --> 00:08:14,781
And that's why you're
always impressive man.

25
00:08:21,978 --> 00:08:24,520
- Hey where you going?
- I'll be back, one second.

26
00:08:25,896 --> 00:08:28,957
Or you could drive around the corner.
Park and come through the front.

27
00:08:58,293 --> 00:08:59,293
Hey.

28
00:08:59,493 --> 00:09:01,985
Wait, wait.
I ain't goin' out there like this.

29
00:09:04,007 --> 00:09:05,168
Do you wanna wear my shirt?

30
00:09:05,317 --> 00:09:07,062
No man. I got it covered, man.

31
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,692
Somebody's coming to bring my shit.

32
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,480
Don't worry.
I got it covered.

33
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:12,928
Who is this guy we're meeting?

34
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:16,709
Elvis.
He's a politician who gives a fuck about the people.

35
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,596
Beautiful.

36
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:05,982
Hey Han.
I bet this is a lot different than China.

37
00:10:06,017 --> 00:10:09,029
- Never been.
- Or Japan, wherever you're from.

38
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,856
Like I said I never been
east of the Altlantic.

39
00:10:12,857 --> 00:10:15,190
- He asked you where you're from.
- States.

40
00:10:15,194 --> 00:10:18,145
- Is that where you met Dom?
- Nah, I met him in Mexico.

41
00:10:18,261 --> 00:10:22,196
Used to hear about him in the racing scene.
But didn't start running with him until then.

42
00:10:23,294 --> 00:10:25,960
And?  You guys are hungry?
Or you want me to get you guys a room?

43
00:10:29,861 --> 00:10:33,657
That's cool.
So you've been running with him for a while?

44
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:38,816
Hey you know.  Here and there.
South America.  Tells me for all the fun stuff.

45
00:10:38,841 --> 00:10:40,041
Wow.

46
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,374
Leo.
Have a seat.

47
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,950
- Hello.
- How you doing my friend?

48
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,413
Well this is the guy I was telling you about.

49
00:10:57,928 --> 00:11:00,386
This meeting gonna be good.
For the island.

50
00:11:00,421 --> 00:11:05,779
Well you know, my friend that I don't
like having unexpected guest.

51
00:11:05,814 --> 00:11:07,632
I already got my crew here.

52
00:11:15,293 --> 00:11:17,787
He knows how I like to do business.

53
00:11:17,997 --> 00:11:19,746
Now, I tell you why.

54
00:11:20,465 --> 00:11:24,548
When the merchandise gets here...
<i>Shut the fuck up!</i>

55
00:11:30,945 --> 00:11:33,244
Like I was saying my friend.

56
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:36,871
I'll protect the merchandise
until it's out of the port.

57
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,070
Once it gets out...

58
00:11:39,168 --> 00:11:42,902
If you wanna do something freaky
that's none of my business.

59
00:11:44,142 --> 00:11:45,261
Okay.

60
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,663
Between the arrival...

61
00:11:50,681 --> 00:11:52,221
and its destination...

62
00:11:56,493 --> 00:11:59,589
there's a very slight window open.

63
00:11:59,624 --> 00:12:01,113
Yeah, don't worry about that.

64
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:09,141
You know at the end of the day people
are gonna get what they need.

65
00:12:11,771 --> 00:12:14,107
You can't move forward without fuel.

66
00:12:16,213 --> 00:12:18,241
And no one wants to be left behind.

67
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:23,072
She can get it and give it to the people.

68
00:12:27,097 --> 00:12:28,297
God bless.

69
00:12:42,274 --> 00:12:43,908
Here baby, I got you a beer.

70
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:02,808
It ain't that hard to track you down.
All I gotta do is follow the odor of skanks.

71
00:13:08,305 --> 00:13:09,449
Letty.

72
00:13:12,378 --> 00:13:14,809
Life has a way of changing those plans.

73
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,061
Change of plans.

74
00:13:22,377 --> 00:13:23,750
Where do we sleep?

75
00:13:27,485 --> 00:13:29,180
Excuse me ladies.

76
00:13:39,422 --> 00:13:41,990
That's right.
All the way from Mexico, sucker.

77
00:14:34,424 --> 00:14:35,371
What?

78
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,842
Who is this?

79
00:14:39,099 --> 00:14:42,432
Did I just hear you speaking Dominican?

80
00:14:42,573 --> 00:14:45,294
It's been a while since I've
been back in the States.

81
00:14:47,227 --> 00:14:49,557
- You know that.
- You're missed.

82
00:14:51,796 --> 00:14:52,900
She's alright.

83
00:14:59,497 --> 00:15:01,232
So what's going on?

84
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,073
I know you're not training
these boys for nothing.

85
00:15:07,102 --> 00:15:10,190
Have I arrived just in time
for a new adventure?

86
00:15:10,691 --> 00:15:13,859
Letty you always get here just
in time for something.

87
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:16,305
Come on, what is it?

88
00:15:27,939 --> 00:15:30,660
I'll block you. You can't see.
What are you gonna do?

89
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:32,861
Oh my God, we're gonna crash.
Oh no!

90
00:15:32,904 --> 00:15:34,356
What's gonna happen?

91
00:16:13,061 --> 00:16:14,497
Wait, this crazy.

92
00:16:17,926 --> 00:16:22,408
Rain one minute. Clouds the other.
Sunlight next.

93
00:16:29,957 --> 00:16:31,167
Where you taking me?

94
00:16:32,256 --> 00:16:35,394
Wait 'til you see.
Wait 'til you see.

95
00:16:40,487 --> 00:16:41,836
Come here.

96
00:17:42,493 --> 00:17:46,710
You feel that?
How could you be 3,000 miles away from that?

97
00:17:46,764 --> 00:17:47,738
Can't.
