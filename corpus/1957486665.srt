A young woman
who has committed herself

52
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:43,462
to the service of people
here at bethel.

Everything from preaching
in my absence,

54

She is your assistant pastor.

that Olivia will be leaving us

When were you gonna tell me?

66
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:27,472
Sweetheart, we've been talking
about this for years.

67
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:29,575
I'm not ready, mom, there's
still so much I have to learn...

68
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:31,543
Livi, Livi, stop, stop.

69
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:33,312
God has prepared you for this.

70
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:36,682
Your father and I have given you
everything that you need.

71
00:03:36,784 --> 00:03:39,117
Trust and believe in you.

72
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,419
I'm not sure if I can.

73
00:03:40,521 --> 00:03:43,322
Then trust in god.

74
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:47,259
And believe in your mama,
I got your back.

75
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:52,431
Listen, listen, it's a small
church in a small town.

76
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:55,968
God has given you the gift
of leadership and service.

77
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,270
Go serve the king.

78
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:01,173
Besides, that's in your blood.

79
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:06,278
Going all the way back
to your great-great-grandfather.

80
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,150
Okay.

81
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:17,356
What's the name of the church?

82
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:20,092
-You ready?
-No.

83
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:22,160
[chuckles]

84
00:04:22,263 --> 00:04:25,230

00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:28,533
-New beginnings.
-Mm-hmm.

86
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:29,968
I like that.

87
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,571
Wait, how did you even find out
about the position?

88
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:35,974
Miss Corrine, a friend of mine
from my spelman days.

89
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:37,909
She and I got to chatting
about a few things,

90
00:04:38,012 --> 00:04:40,279
and one thing lead to another.

91
00:04:40,381 --> 00:04:43,348
And here we are.

92
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,618
Okay. When do I leave?

93
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,388
-Two days.
-Two days?

94
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,290
I'm gonna miss Christmas!

95
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:54,426
I know.

96
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:01,967
Daddy, how am I supposed
to pack up my entire life

97
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:03,802
in two days?

98
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:07,105
Just take what you need,
and we'll send the rest later.

99
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:15,447
Livi, talk to me, sweetheart.

100
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:18,483
-What's going on?
-I'm so used to assisting mom.

101
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:20,852
Not actually being her.

102
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:27,859
Hm, that's the thing,
you are not her, you're you.

103
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:31,463
And this church
will love you for you.

104
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:34,399
-[door shuts]
-who's hungry?

105
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,802
I bought someone's favorite.

106
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:39,738
I know that smell a mile away.

107
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,340
Yes! Thank you!

108
00:05:41,442 --> 00:05:42,941
Livi...

109
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:47,179
I have something
very special just for you.

110
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:49,715
The family bible.

111
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:53,118
This bible has been passed down

112
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,322
to each pastor in our family
for generations.

113
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:02,227
Your grandpa Wesley
gave me this bible

114
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,162
when I first started
preaching and singing,

115
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:07,399
and now I'm giving it to you.

116
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:10,001
The next singing-pastor in line!

117
00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:12,070
Can we just stick to pastor?

118
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:14,840
Livi, stop denying your roots.

119
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:17,743
You can't let one moment
stronghold you

120
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:18,744
for the rest of your life.

121
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:20,679
It was a very traumatic moment,
mom.

122
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:22,748
Then go tell it, livi.

123
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:26,351
Let it set you free.

124
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:29,020
But you are a singing pastor.

125
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:33,125
[Olivia] "let your faith be
bigger than your fears."

126
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:35,594
ah, Hebrews 13:6.

127
00:06:35,696 --> 00:06:37,996
Actually, mom,
I think the scripture reads,

128
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:41,333
"the lord is my helper,
I will not be afraid."

129
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:44,936
it's the essence
of the scripture.

130
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:50,275
See, you were born to lead.

131
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:53,412
Always remember that.
And sing.

132
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:55,647
-Mom.
-Unh-uh. Mm-mm.

133
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,582
Bring it in, come on.

134
00:06:57,684 --> 00:07:01,019
Bring it in, hug your mama.

135
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:04,389
-I love you.
-I love you more, baby girl.

-Yes, ma'am.

Not only am I the
administrative assistant,

but I'm also
the resident decorator.

172

00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:12,717
You'll get the hang of things
around here soon enough.

177
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:14,152
Now, let me show you
to your office.

178
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:15,687
Okay.

179
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:20,625
Well, normally, I handle
the day-to-day operations

180
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,260
so that you can just focus
on the ministries

181
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:23,562
and grow our church.

182
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:25,330
Well, that was the agreement

183
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:26,331
between pastor Byrd and me.

184
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:29,367
It's totally okay
if you wanna change it.

185
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:31,269
Oh, no, no.
In the spirit of pastor Byrd,

186
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:34,205
let's, let's just keep it
the way it is.

187
00:09:34,308 --> 00:09:36,841
Do miss that man.
He was a great pastor.

188
00:09:36,944 --> 00:09:39,844
Big shoes to fill.

189
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:43,048
But you'll be all right.

190
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:46,284
Here's your office, pastor.

191
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:52,424
Oh.

192
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:00,966
[chuckles]

193
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:02,200
welcome to your new office,
pastor.

194
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:03,969
I got a little fun and free
back here.

195
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:06,905
It's, it's so festive.

196
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:10,008
Thank you, pastor! I was so
proud of the way it turned out.

197
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,310
I had to put it
on the social medias.

198
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:14,212
It's just a little more
than I anticipated.

199
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:16,781
I-I'm more simple,

200
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:19,684
modest, clean lines, you know.

201
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,621
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

202
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:23,955
Oh, don't worry about that,

203
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:26,825
brother Carl is working
on your name plate.

204
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:30,028
That's pastor Byrd.
I'm so sorry.

205
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,498
-I'll take it out immediately.
-It's okay.

206
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,101
-And this?
-That's the winter jamboree.

207
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:37,268
It's the highlight of
greenwood's Christmas season.

208
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:40,772
Every Christmas eve,
genesis opens up the festival.

209
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:43,008
-It's tradition!
-I love tradition.

210
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,243
Gonna miss mine this year.

211
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:46,911
Well, who said you couldn't
bring your tradition

212
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:49,514
to greenwood, pastor?
What's your favorite tradition?

213
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:52,217
-The Christmas party.
-Oh, I love a good party.

214
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:53,518
We're gonna circle back
around to that.

215
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,288
Okay. Did pastor Byrd
direct the choir?

216
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:58,890
Oh, pastor, our choir was fire!

217
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,659
Pastor Byrd took great pride
in it.

218
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:04,195
Next to the almighty himself,
music was his true love.

219
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:08,767
-A singing pastor.
-Oh, he did it all.

220
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:10,969
But I know you got this!

221
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:13,438
[whispering] I don't know, god.

222
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,042
-You say something, pastor?
-U-um, uh-hmm.

223
00:11:17,144 --> 00:11:19,744
-The parsonage?
-Oh, yes! Well... No.

224
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,713
There was no saving
the parsonage.

225
00:11:21,815 --> 00:11:25,750
So until we find you a place,
you're staying with me.

226
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,453
-Oh, no, um, miss, miss...
-no, ma'am.

227
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:30,989
It's settled.

228
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:36,928
Oh, what has momma done.

229
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:43,635

[indistinct chatter]

231
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,014
welcome to Selah's.
What can I do you for?

232
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:57,582
Well, I hear you have
the best burger in town.

233
00:11:57,684 --> 00:12:00,118
-And you heard right.
-Nice.

234
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,519
-With or without cheese?
-Without.

235
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:02,654
Coming right up. Uh...

236
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:06,024
Your money's no good here,
pastor.

237
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:09,127
[chuckles] it's a small town.
Word travels quick.

238
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,996
It'll be up in a minute.
Find yourself a seat.

239
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:13,965
Thank you.

240
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:17,202
Pastor Olivia?

241
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:20,271
[chuckles] care to join me?

242
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,441
Sure.

243
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:28,546
[instrumental music]

244
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,685
I didn't expect to see you again
so soon.

245
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:38,056
I wasn't looking for you,
I'm-I'm just saying...

246
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:38,790
Y-you... Yeah.

247
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:40,358
Well, this is a small town,

248
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,993
I'll probably see you
two more times

249
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:42,427
by the end of the night.

250
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:44,229
Really?

251
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:47,966
-Stella, this is...
-pastor Olivia.

252
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:49,567
Come on, Ashton, catch up!

253
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:53,471
-Now, you two, enjoy.
-Thank you.

254
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,944
-Okay.
-Mm-hmm.

255
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:03,815
Oh, so you... You gonna eat that
with a knife and fork?

256
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:06,751
It's a burger.
You're supposed to pick it up

257
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:10,588
with your hands
and bite into it.

258
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:13,892
Ooh, look at the...
You have a...

259
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:15,794
-It's supposed to be messy.
-Uh-huh.

260
00:13:15,896 --> 00:13:18,229
I would prefer to keep my sauce
on my burger.

261
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:20,165
[chuckles]

262
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:22,400
whatever.

263
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:24,669
I can get you a knife and fork
if you really want.

264
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:25,970
Uh, no, thank you.

265
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:28,740
-You're somethin' else.
-Oh...

266
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,243
[laughing]

267
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:34,846
I was just like...

268
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:37,182
Oh, my god.

269
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:38,817
I didn't realize
how much time had passed.

270
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,785
I'm sure miss dee
is worried about me.

271
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:42,353
-You at dee's?
-Yeah.

272
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:45,089
That's right around the corner.
I'll walk you.

273
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:47,358
-Okay.
-Okay.

274
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:53,064
So, what brings you
to greenwood?

275
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,101
-[sighs] my mother.
-Mm.

276
00:13:57,204 --> 00:13:59,838
Yeah, she got to talking with
her old spelman friend,

277
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,240
miss Corrine and, uh,

278
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,042
the two of them devised this
plan to get me here.

279
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:08,379
Wow, so your mother
and miss Corrine

280
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:08,913
ain't give you an option?

281
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:12,417
-Nope.
-I know.

282
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,719
-No, no, no option there.
-No.

283
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:16,721
[instrumental music]

284
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:18,623
my mother does it
so effortlessly.

285
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:21,659
How am I supposed to be like
her? Or pastor Byrd?

286
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:25,864
Just, just some
huge shoes to fill.

287
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:29,234
Well, maybe you're just supposed
to be like you.

288
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,036
I'm all too familiar with trying
to be something I'm not.

289
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:35,406
Oh. And what was that?

290
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,811
Well, lookie here,
we have arrived.

291
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:44,015
Pastor, it has been my pleasure
spending my afternoon with you.

292
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:46,417
Please just call me Olivia.

293
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,052
And the pleasure was all mine.

294
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:51,122
-Maybe I'll see you tomorrow?
-It's a small town.

295
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,457
[chuckles] okay.

296
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,127

00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:17,015
-You need anything?
-No, no, I'm fine. Thank you.

-I zhuzh'd it up a little.

Sister ida, I am here to support
and to grow...

347
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,814
you think you know
the first thing

348
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:06,250
about running a church,
assistant pastor?

349
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,586
-I'm here to try.
-Oh.

350
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:10,521
We ain't got no time to try.

351
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:12,457
Things need your attention.

352
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,892
This is the Christmas season,

353
00:18:14,994 --> 00:18:16,360
everybody looks to the church
for leadership.

354
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:19,297
There's the wrap it up,
toy wrapping party,

355
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:21,833
the ho-ho-ho Santa
can food drive...

356
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:23,167
Could you start over?
I just want to...

357
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,736
there's the three wisemen's
mobile meals...

358
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:26,504
The winter jamboree!

359
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:27,972
I was about to say that, Stella!

360
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:33,678
And the winter jamboree, which
is our premiere Christmas event.

361
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,682
Oh, and don't forget the
paperwork, assistant pastor.

362
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:38,716
The jamboree's in five weeks.

363
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:43,855
You fail the jamboree,
you fail the church.

364
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:46,424
And remember,
this is your trial period.

365
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:49,360
You ain't got the job yet.

366
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,729
We'll determine that
by the new year.

367
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:55,466
Oh, and the "sent from an angel"
holiday cards.

368
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:57,235
-Holiday cards?
-For our sick and shut-in.

369
00:18:57,337 --> 00:19:00,538
[ida] Carl!

370
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,908
I'm working on that name plate,
pastor. Okay?

371
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,711
Brother Carl, her husband.

372
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,946
Thank you. Thank you.

373
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:16,888
Don't pay ida any mind.

374
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,457
-She's grieving.
-I'm on a trial period?

375
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:22,860
Yes. All new pastors
have a short trial period.

376
00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:25,429
Make sure we're a good fit,
is all.

377
00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:27,732
You'll win sister ida over.

378
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:31,068
You got this.

379
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:34,639
Thank you.

380
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:38,976
Do I?

381
00:19:42,115 --> 00:19:46,117
[instrumental music]

382
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:50,288
[sighs] perfect.

383
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:53,958
Well, why don't we just let
nature take its course?

384
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,694
-[chuckles] uh-hmm.
-[door opens]

385
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:59,564
ooh, got to go.

386
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:03,000
Pastor Olivia Richard!

387
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:05,570
If you aren't
the spitting image of Etta!

388
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:08,339
Miss Corrine?

389
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:09,373
So, how you liking
old greenwood?

390
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:12,410
I'm adjusting. It's cute.

391
00:20:12,512 --> 00:20:15,146
It's really small.

392
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:19,684
Honey, I can't wait to hear you
bring a word on Sunday.

393
00:20:19,786 --> 00:20:22,119
Hmm, I know you're gonna be
just as strong

394
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:24,055
and powerful as your mother.

395
00:20:24,157 --> 00:20:28,092
Hmm, and ain't nothing like
a singing pastor.

396
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:31,295
-Singing?
-Uh, yes, ma'am.

397
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:34,398
The church wanted
another singing pastor.

398
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,969
And if you can sing
anything like your mother,

399
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:39,904
we gonna be all right.

400
00:20:40,006 --> 00:20:41,539
Yes. Yes.

401
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:45,042
So, I hear you are
looking for a place?

402
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:48,012
-I am.
-Mom?

403
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:53,184
-Ashton?
-Oh!

404
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:55,152
So you're the reason

405
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:57,855
my son has been so smitten?

406
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:03,861
Ashton, pastor Olivia
is looking for a place to stay.

407
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:08,499
I'll see you in church
on Sunday, pastor.

408
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:11,535
Yes, ma'am.

409
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:16,274
Mother?

410
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:20,544
Okay, so you are a man
of many hats.

411
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:23,714
Man of many hats
at your service.

412
00:21:25,852 --> 00:21:28,119
I have a few to show you.

413
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:33,724
[instrumental music]

414
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,829
Etta...

415
00:21:45,872 --> 00:21:48,406
I have to sing
to keep my job, mom.

416
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:51,442
<i> -Well, hello to you too, livi.</i>
-Why would you do that?

417
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:54,078
Why would you send me here
knowing I don't sing?

418
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,281
<i> Livi, you do sing.</i>
<i> You come from a long line of...</i>

419
00:21:57,383 --> 00:21:59,684
yeah, mom, I don't wanna
hear that, okay?

420
00:21:59,786 --> 00:22:03,754
I'm not you. No one can be
the great pastor Etta Richard.

421
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:06,624
Besides, they want to hear you
sing, not me!

422
00:22:06,726 --> 00:22:08,259
<i> No, they don't.</i>

423
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:10,895
<i> They wanna hear you sing.</i>
<i> Now, you, you may not like</i>

424
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:12,463
<i> how I got you to greenwood,</i>

425
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:14,098
<i> but you're gonna have to face</i>
<i> this trauma.</i>

426
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,833
<i> You're gonna have to</i>
<i> look it in the eye.</i>

427
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:19,136
<i> You're gonna have to call it</i>
<i> out and rebuke it.</i>

428
00:22:19,238 --> 00:22:22,340
<i> Sweetheart, you're hiding your</i>
<i> gift from the world.</i>

429
00:22:22,442 --> 00:22:26,844
I love you,
but right now, I just...

430
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:28,813
I gotta go.

431
00:22:37,457 --> 00:22:41,659
I did not put my best foot
forward today.

432
00:22:41,761 --> 00:22:45,029
My mother has never been late
for a leadership meeting.

433
00:22:45,131 --> 00:22:47,898
She always says, "the church is
a direct reflection

434
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,502
of its leadership,
inadequate Shepard, lost sheep."

435
00:22:51,604 --> 00:22:55,506
your mother is a
powerful preacher.

436
00:22:57,243 --> 00:22:59,410
You've heard my mom preach?

437
00:22:59,512 --> 00:23:03,614
Corrine dragged me to Chicago
a few times to hear her.

438
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:07,952
Now, your momma
can bring the word. And sing.

439
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:09,620
I can't wait to hear
that voice on you!

440
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,088
-I don't sing.
-Well, sure, you do.

441
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:14,759
-I heard you.
-I don't... I don't sing.

442
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:18,162
<i> ♪ jingle bells jingle bells ♪</i>

443
00:23:18,264 --> 00:23:20,765
<i> ♪ jingle all the way... ♪</i>

444
00:23:20,867 --> 00:23:23,534
help me out.

445
00:23:29,142 --> 00:23:30,808
So, um...

446
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,410
I've been thinking
about that list

447
00:23:32,512 --> 00:23:34,211
sister ida was rattling off,

448
00:23:34,313 --> 00:23:36,147
and it's intimidating.

449
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:37,248
I don't wanna fail the church.
And god knows,

450
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:40,684
I-I cannot fail my mom.

451
00:23:40,787 --> 00:23:42,953
Look, you're right,

452
00:23:43,055 --> 00:23:45,856
it's intimidating.

453
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:48,759
But you got a calling, pastor.

454
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:52,062
So, we'll take it
one step at a time.

455
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:54,899
-"we?"
-yes.

456
00:23:55,001 --> 00:23:58,002
I'm with you all the way.

457
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:00,771
And don't think pastor Byrd
had it all together.

458
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:04,008
His first year was a mess.
Girl, he almost quit.

459
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:06,911
Now, back to that list.

460
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:08,345
On Friday, brother Carl's
gonna drop off

461
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,880
the box of Christmas cards.

462
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:11,582
And the Christmas committee
has already organized

463
00:24:11,684 --> 00:24:13,050
"the wrap it up"
toy wrapping party.

464
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:15,152
-That's next Saturday.
-Next Saturday. Okay.

465
00:24:15,254 --> 00:24:18,856
-Just show up. Oh, on time.
-Mm-hmm.

466
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:21,459
[laughs]

467
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:26,630
now, tell me about the sermon
you're preparing for Sunday.

468
00:24:26,732 --> 00:24:28,699
Well...

469
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:33,604
It's about turning...

470
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:36,173
-Let the church say, amen!
-Amen.

471
00:24:36,275 --> 00:24:37,341
Amen, amen!
Before we begin,

472
00:24:37,443 --> 00:24:39,243
I want to take a moment
to thank miss dee...

473
00:24:39,345 --> 00:24:43,147
you're welcome, pastor.

474
00:24:43,249 --> 00:24:44,114
Thank you so much, miss dee.

475
00:24:44,217 --> 00:24:46,717
I understand
it is tradition for her

476
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:49,587
to do the decorations
around the holidays.

477
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:52,590
I also understand it is
tradition to count down

478
00:24:52,692 --> 00:24:54,625
to the glorious jamboree!

479
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:56,727
[cheering]

480
00:24:59,632 --> 00:25:01,765
hallelujah! Now on that note,

481
00:25:01,868 --> 00:25:04,969
the word says to "make a joyful
noise unto the lord."

482
00:25:05,071 --> 00:25:06,637
[cheering]

483
00:25:06,739 --> 00:25:07,404
it says to serve
the lord with...

484
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:10,140
-Gladness!
-Hallelu...

485
00:25:10,243 --> 00:25:12,243
It says to come before his
presence with singing.

486
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:14,245
Come on, choir,
bless us through song.

487
00:25:14,347 --> 00:25:18,082
-All right, praise Jesus.
-Praise Jesus.

488
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:20,684
Yes, god!

489
00:25:21,787 --> 00:25:23,020

[indistinct chatter]

512
00:26:53,296 --> 00:26:55,429
what on god's green earth
are you doing?

513
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:57,898
-Here, let me help you.
-Ooh.

514
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,036
Just thought I would get a jump
on things and help pastor out.

515
00:27:02,138 --> 00:27:04,972
Sister ida gonna scare her off
before she can get started good.

516
00:27:05,074 --> 00:27:06,907
-Sister ida is grieving.
-No.

517
00:27:07,009 --> 00:27:09,176
Sister ida is mean.

518
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:10,477
And somebody should tell her.

519
00:27:10,579 --> 00:27:14,381
Oh, no, honey, god's got to a
special angel for that one.

520
00:27:14,483 --> 00:27:17,718
And he knows my heart
and I ain't it.

521
00:27:19,755 --> 00:27:21,755
I thought pastor was gonna sing
during her sermon.

522
00:27:21,857 --> 00:27:26,126
She will.
In god's time, not in our time.

523
00:27:27,096 --> 00:27:30,064
Well, it's nice having
a female leader.

524
00:27:31,801 --> 00:27:34,768
Is she gonna be okay?
Make it to the new year?

525
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:37,037
Yeah, just give her some time.

526
00:27:37,139 --> 00:27:40,741
Just give her some time.
The Grinch need time, too.

527
00:27:40,843 --> 00:27:42,810
Sister ida.

528
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:44,945
[laughing]

529
00:27:47,149 --> 00:27:50,351
[instrumental music]

530
00:27:51,787 --> 00:27:53,687
wait a minute.

531
00:27:53,789 --> 00:27:57,391
Oh, my, that is beautiful.

532
00:27:57,493 --> 00:27:59,460
[keys clacking]

533
00:28:10,673 --> 00:28:12,139
yes!

534
00:28:13,576 --> 00:28:15,209
Oh, this house looks
even better in person.

535
00:28:15,311 --> 00:28:16,977
Let me help you up these stairs.

536
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:17,945
Thank you.

537
00:28:18,047 --> 00:28:20,547
Wow.

538
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:23,851
Wait until you see inside.

539
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,720
[gasps]

540
00:28:26,822 --> 00:28:29,757
[chuckles]

541
00:28:34,363 --> 00:28:37,398
[piano music]

542
00:28:39,902 --> 00:28:41,568
sold.

543
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:43,537
But you haven't even seen
the rest of the house yet.

544
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:44,505
No need.
I saw it all on zillow.

545
00:28:44,607 --> 00:28:47,741
But seriously,
walk through the house.

546
00:28:47,843 --> 00:28:49,610
Take it all in.

547
00:28:57,853 --> 00:29:02,790
Let's see what this old piano
can do.

[applauds] you are amazing.

567
00:30:45,995 --> 00:30:48,829
-Oh. I play a little.
-A little?

568
00:30:48,931 --> 00:30:50,898
You should be sharing this gift
with the world.

569
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,668
Well, I should be. But maybe
god saw it differently.

570
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:58,205
-That didn't work out.
-Oh, I can't believe that.

571
00:30:58,307 --> 00:31:00,440
So, why didn't it work out?

572
00:31:00,543 --> 00:31:02,709
What didn't work out?
The singing? The playing?

573
00:31:02,811 --> 00:31:04,344
Because your gift...

574
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:06,914
are you trying to pastor me
right now?

575
00:31:07,216 --> 00:31:09,550
-Please don't.
-No, I-I...

576
00:31:09,652 --> 00:31:10,851
I wasn't trying to pastor you.

577
00:31:10,953 --> 00:31:13,987
I was genuinely interested.

578
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:17,457
I'm sorry.

579
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,393
You didn't deserve that.

580
00:31:21,163 --> 00:31:22,629
I failed as a musician.

581
00:31:22,731 --> 00:31:25,399
My motto is
"you gotta be all in."

582
00:31:25,501 --> 00:31:28,635
'cause that's how you
gotta live life.

583
00:31:28,737 --> 00:31:30,370
So, I moved to Houston,
and connected

584
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:32,205
with some of auntie ida's
old band members

585
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:35,242
and started gigging.

586
00:31:35,344 --> 00:31:36,710
Everything was going great.

587
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:40,247
We were making money,
packing the house,

588
00:31:40,349 --> 00:31:42,182
working on a record deal.

589
00:31:43,285 --> 00:31:45,218
And then the bottom fell out.

590
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:48,488
The deal just disappeared.

591
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:55,028
So, I turned to what I know,
real estate.

592
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:56,463
And I stayed in Houston
until I finally got that call,

593
00:31:56,565 --> 00:32:01,468
"your father is ready to retire,
turn the business over to you."

594
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:05,472
so started packing,
and now I'm here.

595
00:32:07,209 --> 00:32:09,142
I'm not mad to be home...

596
00:32:10,312 --> 00:32:13,113
'cause dope things
can happen anywhere.

597
00:32:14,216 --> 00:32:15,816
You just got to be open to it.

598
00:32:15,918 --> 00:32:19,052
You didn't fail.

599
00:32:20,956 --> 00:32:24,625
-You should play with us.
-Play with who?

600
00:32:24,727 --> 00:32:26,226
You should play for the church.

601
00:32:26,328 --> 00:32:28,462
Yeah, the-the church needs
a choir director,

602
00:32:28,564 --> 00:32:30,597
you need to be making music,
and I need somebody

603
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:32,532
to whip that choir into shape.
Come on!

604
00:32:32,635 --> 00:32:34,368
I have not played
in that church in years.

605
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:37,104
Help me get ready
for the jamboree

606
00:32:37,206 --> 00:32:40,807
and get me one up on sister ida.

607
00:32:40,909 --> 00:32:42,075
Who is your aunt!

608
00:32:42,177 --> 00:32:45,779
You kept that close
to the chest there.

609
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:47,114
I feel like you owe me.

610
00:32:47,216 --> 00:32:48,915
Where's your Christmas spirit?
Come on!

611
00:32:49,018 --> 00:32:50,851
Please?

612
00:32:50,953 --> 00:32:54,287
Please? Please?

613
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:58,892
All in,
'cause that's how we gotta be.

614
00:32:58,994 --> 00:33:00,494
Of course.

616
00:33:03,098 --> 00:33:05,365
hello! Woo-hoo!

617
00:33:05,467 --> 00:33:08,301
This is not working.
Excuse me?

[piano music]

619
00:33:13,242 --> 00:33:15,442
thank you.

620
00:33:15,544 --> 00:33:17,210
Brother Carl,
would you please do the honors?

621
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:19,312
[clears throat]
uh, yes.

622
00:33:19,415 --> 00:33:22,549
We got to talking and decided
it would be ideal

623
00:33:22,651 --> 00:33:25,619
if brother Ashton would take
over as the choir director.

624
00:33:25,721 --> 00:33:27,254
[applause]

625
00:33:27,356 --> 00:33:29,322
thankfully, I'm going to retire

626
00:33:29,425 --> 00:33:32,125
back to the tenor section
where I belong.

627
00:33:32,227 --> 00:33:34,361
[woman 1] amen!

628
00:33:34,463 --> 00:33:36,596
[indistinct chatter]

629
00:33:36,699 --> 00:33:39,232
okay, then I guess
you got it from here.

630
00:33:39,334 --> 00:33:42,769
Godspeed. You have about three
weeks, but no pressure.

631
00:33:44,006 --> 00:33:46,339
You got this!

632
00:33:46,442 --> 00:33:49,576
Well, I thought we'd start off
with an old hymn.

633
00:33:49,678 --> 00:33:51,978
-Knock knock! Howdy, pastor?
-How's the choir?

634
00:33:52,081 --> 00:33:53,780
-Here you go.
-Oh, wait, you...

635
00:33:53,882 --> 00:33:55,916
You were supposed to deliver
those last Friday.

636
00:33:56,018 --> 00:33:58,752
-It's Tuesday.
-I'm late.

637
00:33:59,888 --> 00:34:01,888
-Whoa, whoa, what're you doing?
-Oh.

638
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:05,926
Sister ida wants this box back.
Sorry, pastor.

639
00:34:06,028 --> 00:34:07,561
How many sick and shut-in
do we have?

640
00:34:07,663 --> 00:34:09,830
-Pastor.
-What?

641
00:34:09,932 --> 00:34:11,498
There's a deluge
in the women's restroom.

642
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:16,069
-A what? No!
-A flood. A flood.

643
00:34:16,171 --> 00:34:18,772
No, no, no, no, no, no!

[instrumental music]

645
00:34:29,318 --> 00:34:30,851
god, this cannot be happening.

646
00:34:30,953 --> 00:34:35,388
The Christmas toy wrapping party
is on Saturday, and I can't...

647
00:34:35,491 --> 00:34:40,227
You tired of playing pastor,
yet, assistant pastor?

648
00:34:47,402 --> 00:34:49,536
[instrumental music]

649
00:34:49,638 --> 00:34:52,305
pastor, I am so glad
you decided to move

650
00:34:52,407 --> 00:34:55,242
this toy wrapping party
to the community center.

651
00:34:55,344 --> 00:34:57,811
It's so refreshing
for the community to see...

652
00:34:57,913 --> 00:35:00,113
The church doing such good work.

653
00:35:00,215 --> 00:35:02,816
I can't believe the church
donated all of these toys.

654
00:35:02,918 --> 00:35:05,152
Hey, each year it keeps growing
bigger and bigger.

655
00:35:05,254 --> 00:35:08,021
It's crazy, just five years ago
auntie ida started this drive.

656
00:35:08,123 --> 00:35:10,624
Wait, sister ida
started the toy drive?

657
00:35:10,726 --> 00:35:13,527
Yep, a little girl
walked up to her,

658
00:35:13,629 --> 00:35:15,462
asked her for some change
for her family.

659
00:35:15,564 --> 00:35:16,930
Auntie says she looked around,
realized

660
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:19,099
she was in the middle
of a homeless encampment.

661
00:35:19,201 --> 00:35:22,102
There was a small Christmas tree
and nativity scene.

662
00:35:22,204 --> 00:35:25,172
And right then she just knew.

663
00:35:25,274 --> 00:35:27,274
-Sister ida?
-Mm-hmm!

664
00:35:27,376 --> 00:35:30,243
Yeah, she just bought up
a bunch of toys,

665
00:35:30,345 --> 00:35:32,779
gave some to the little girl and
started passing out the rest

666
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:33,947
to the church members in need.

667
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:35,649
[Ashton]
yeah, kinda of became a thing.

668
00:35:35,751 --> 00:35:37,150
We...

669
00:35:37,252 --> 00:35:39,286
We're talking about that,
that one,

670
00:35:39,388 --> 00:35:41,721
that sister ida started this?

671
00:35:41,824 --> 00:35:43,924
-She's grieving.
-She's grieving.

672
00:35:45,027 --> 00:35:47,027
Okay, sister ida.

673
00:35:50,432 --> 00:35:52,199
Excuse me, everyone,
if I could have your attention

674
00:35:52,301 --> 00:35:54,434
for a moment?

675
00:35:57,639 --> 00:35:59,639
When I found out
that the toy wrapping party

676
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:02,375
was a genesis tradition,
it warmed my heart.

677
00:36:02,477 --> 00:36:06,613
And it really made me miss the
Christmas traditions from home.

678
00:36:06,715 --> 00:36:10,016
Miss dee said I didn't have to
leave my traditions in Chicago,

679
00:36:10,118 --> 00:36:10,617
she said I could
bring them here.

680
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:13,420
So, at mount bethel,

681
00:36:13,522 --> 00:36:14,855
we have the giving wreath.

682
00:36:14,957 --> 00:36:17,557
It does come with one rule,
in order to take something,

683
00:36:17,659 --> 00:36:19,059
you must leave something.

684
00:36:19,161 --> 00:36:22,329
A token, a small handmade
something, a card.

685
00:36:22,431 --> 00:36:24,231
Anything that will allow it
to continue to give

686
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:27,167
throughout the advent season.

687
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:30,370
Just a special way to continue
to celebrate each other.

688
00:36:30,472 --> 00:36:33,940
So, please enjoy the wreath
that keeps on giving!

689
00:36:34,042 --> 00:36:35,609
[applause]

690
00:36:35,711 --> 00:36:38,311
-oh, I'm going first!
-No.

691
00:36:38,413 --> 00:36:40,513
[laughter]

692
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:44,818
well, that is so great.

693
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,721
Yeah, my dad loves Christmas.

694
00:36:47,823 --> 00:36:49,656
He made up this tradition.

695
00:36:49,758 --> 00:36:52,425
He wanted the church to give
back to the community more,

696
00:36:52,527 --> 00:36:53,927
during the season.

697
00:36:54,029 --> 00:36:56,630
Okay, well, since
we're sharing traditions,

698
00:36:56,732 --> 00:36:58,732
how about I introduce you
to greenwood's

699
00:36:58,834 --> 00:37:00,133
annual cookie hop
tomorrow night?

700
00:37:00,235 --> 00:37:02,168
A cookie hop?

701
00:37:02,271 --> 00:37:05,672
-Sounds fun.
-It is.

702
00:37:05,774 --> 00:37:07,774
So it's a date?

703
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:18,118
Ah, saved you a piece
of Christmas pie.

704
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,719
Yes!

705
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:25,425
[sighs] so, about that hot date
tomorrow night.

706
00:37:25,527 --> 00:37:27,560
I should've known
you were listening.

707
00:37:27,663 --> 00:37:29,296
Oh, pastor, it's not my fault
your business

708
00:37:29,398 --> 00:37:30,297
is the talk of the town.

709
00:37:30,399 --> 00:37:31,898
The town?

710
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,199
Aww, don't be embarrassed.
What else we gone talk about?

711
00:37:33,302 --> 00:37:35,669
It's the juiciest thing
we got going on.

712
00:37:35,771 --> 00:37:40,307
And the cookie hop, such a
public and festive evening out.

713
00:37:40,409 --> 00:37:43,576
-Everybody's gonna be there?
-Oh, everybody, pastor.

714
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:44,811
So, what are we wearing?

715
00:37:44,913 --> 00:37:50,083
Well, I-I was thinking this,
but in a different color.

716
00:37:51,086 --> 00:37:53,887
Pastor, it's a date,
not a baptismal.

717
00:37:53,989 --> 00:37:56,323
Show a little shoulder.

718
00:37:56,425 --> 00:37:58,425
Oh, now, come on, grab that
wreath and the hot glue gun.

719
00:37:58,527 --> 00:38:01,795
-Okay.
-And let's talk cookie hop.

720
00:38:01,897 --> 00:38:03,897
[both laughing]

721
00:38:10,372 --> 00:38:13,606
-Ashton?
-Oh, wow.

722
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:17,477
[chuckles] you look absolutely
beautiful.

723
00:38:19,114 --> 00:38:21,414
Your hand, please.

724
00:38:21,516 --> 00:38:23,817
I got us wrist bands so we can
sample all the cookies.

725
00:38:23,919 --> 00:38:25,585
Mm-hmm?
Now what is a cookie hop?

726
00:38:25,687 --> 00:38:28,722
Okay. So every Christmas,

727
00:38:28,824 --> 00:38:30,957
all the bakers, professional
or not, they all compete

728
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:32,559
for the "best cookie in town"
title.

729
00:38:32,661 --> 00:38:35,929
Oh. See, we don't have that
in Chicago,

730
00:38:36,031 --> 00:38:38,198
so this is gonna be fun.

731
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:41,735
Uh, come on.

732
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:45,872
[instrumental music]

733
00:38:45,974 --> 00:38:48,875
[indistinct chatter]

734
00:38:59,421 --> 00:39:01,254
wait, so let's talk about
that perfect chord you

735
00:39:01,356 --> 00:39:02,188
hit the other day.

736
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:03,490
I don't know
what you talking about.

737
00:39:03,592 --> 00:39:04,824
-Yes, you do.
-Unh-unh.

738
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:08,862
-So you play a little?
-A little.

739
00:39:08,964 --> 00:39:10,463
I come from a family
of musicians and singers.

740
00:39:10,565 --> 00:39:13,166
My mother, grandfather,
great-grandfather.

741
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:16,736
-All singing pastors.
-Wait, so you sing.

742
00:39:16,838 --> 00:39:19,005
-Let's hear it!
-Nope. My mother sings.

743
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:20,774
-I listen.
-Mm, come on, let me hear you.

744
00:39:20,876 --> 00:39:23,910
I don't sing. I don't.
Plus, we're at a cookie hop.

745
00:39:24,012 --> 00:39:28,081
Nah, I'm with you.

746
00:39:28,183 --> 00:39:30,717
-So tell me why you don't sing.
-Ashton, come on.

747
00:39:36,091 --> 00:39:37,924
Fine.

748
00:39:40,328 --> 00:39:41,861
Being a preacher's kid is a lot,

749
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:44,431
but being a pk under
my mother's shadow,

750
00:39:44,533 --> 00:39:47,200
even now,
it's a ton of pressure.

751
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:49,936
-And?
-And...

752
00:39:50,038 --> 00:39:51,204
[chuckles]

753
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:53,206
it was my first solo.

754
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:55,108
It's kind of a rite of passage
in our family.

755
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:57,077
I had to be like 15 or 16.

756
00:39:57,179 --> 00:40:00,513
And there I was
shaking like a leaf.

757
00:40:00,615 --> 00:40:03,817
And I did it
and I was so proud of myself,

758
00:40:03,919 --> 00:40:05,819
until the room got quiet.

759
00:40:05,921 --> 00:40:12,292
I open my eyes and the choir
director comes to me and says,

760
00:40:12,394 --> 00:40:15,061
"you're supposed to be
pastor Richard's daughter

761
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:16,429
and that's all you got."

762
00:40:16,531 --> 00:40:19,032
wow.

763
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:25,004
I just stood there ashamed
and in disbelief.

764
00:40:26,108 --> 00:40:28,608
I'm sorry to hear that.

765
00:40:29,878 --> 00:40:32,278
-Church hurt is real.
-Yeah.

766
00:40:33,748 --> 00:40:34,347
But I still wanna hear you sing.

767
00:40:34,449 --> 00:40:36,416
-Boy!
-I'm just saying.

768
00:40:36,518 --> 00:40:38,017
I mean, look,
this is all we got.

769
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,452
-You gotta be all in.
-All in.

770
00:40:39,554 --> 00:40:41,754
-Yes, I know your motto.
-Right. Yup, all the time.

771
00:40:41,857 --> 00:40:44,958
Wait, hold up.
Did she keep her job?

772
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,559
Did she... No, no!

773
00:40:46,661 --> 00:40:48,862
-She was gone the next day.
-All right.

774
00:40:48,964 --> 00:40:50,396
All right.

775
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:53,466
You got a little...

776
00:40:55,904 --> 00:40:58,371
[instrumental music]

777
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:11,651
[sighs] trust in the lord
with all your heart

778
00:41:11,753 --> 00:41:14,921
and do not lean
on your own understanding.

779
00:41:16,625 --> 00:41:18,925
[cellphone chimes]

780
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,840

781
00:41:41,716 --> 00:41:42,916
[indistinct chatter]

782
00:41:43,018 --> 00:41:46,619
sister ida, it would be nice
to hear some good news from you.

783
00:41:46,721 --> 00:41:48,721
Dee, don't you use that tone
with me, little girl.

784
00:41:48,823 --> 00:41:51,658
I know your mama.
I'm just sayin',

785
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,428
I got strong numbers on that
board ready to vote her out.

786
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:59,966
We're looking
for a singing pastor. A leader.

787
00:42:05,974 --> 00:42:10,376
Ashton, play my song. I need a
little holiday joy up in here.

788
00:42:10,478 --> 00:42:12,845

[applause continues]

choir...
That choir sang today.

892
00:47:50,051 --> 00:47:52,418
Yeah, choir did its part,

893
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,687
it's time for me to
bring this word. Amen!

894
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:58,090
-[all] amen!
-[Olivia] amen! Turn with me...

895
00:47:58,192 --> 00:47:59,692
[tapping]

896
00:47:59,794 --> 00:48:02,962
turn with me to
Hebrews 13:6. Amen.

897
00:48:03,064 --> 00:48:05,498
-[indistinct chatter]
-[Olivia] Whoo!

898
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,868
[instrumental music]

899
00:48:10,972 --> 00:48:12,471
one candy cane freeze for me,

900
00:48:12,574 --> 00:48:15,875
and one coco-la-da Christmas
milkshake for you.

901
00:48:15,977 --> 00:48:16,776
-Hah!
-[Ashton chuckling]

902
00:48:16,878 --> 00:48:18,110
how did you know
this is my favorite?

903
00:48:18,212 --> 00:48:19,445
A little birdie told me.

904
00:48:19,547 --> 00:48:22,782
-Thank you. Uh-hmm.
-[both chuckle]

905
00:48:25,987 --> 00:48:26,819
I miss Chicago.

906
00:48:26,921 --> 00:48:30,556
My mom, dad...

907
00:48:30,658 --> 00:48:33,793
But this town is
starting to feel like home.

908
00:48:36,064 --> 00:48:37,430
[Olivia chuckles]

909
00:48:37,532 --> 00:48:39,365
so, they build this every year?

910
00:48:39,467 --> 00:48:44,670
Yep. One of my favorite things
to do every Christmas holiday.

911
00:48:44,772 --> 00:48:46,272
Guess you can call it
my tradition.

912
00:48:46,374 --> 00:48:48,040
[both chuckle]

913
00:48:49,677 --> 00:48:53,579
so, Olivia, who is no longer
pastor for tonight.

914
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:55,648
Right.

915
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:58,117
-Shall we play?
-Oh, we shall.

916
00:48:58,219 --> 00:48:59,885
-Hah.
-[Ashton chuckling]

917
00:48:59,988 --> 00:49:01,220
come on. Come on.

918
00:49:01,322 --> 00:49:02,855
All right.
I'm hats, you're bells.

919
00:49:02,957 --> 00:49:05,091
See, you're cheating,
there's clearly two pieces

920
00:49:05,193 --> 00:49:06,158
already on the board.

921
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:06,826
You snooze, you lose.

922
00:49:06,928 --> 00:49:08,461
Oh, you ain't right.

923
00:49:08,563 --> 00:49:10,696
[chuckles]
ah! Nice move.

924
00:49:10,798 --> 00:49:11,998
Ah!

925
00:49:13,134 --> 00:49:14,266
You know...

926
00:49:15,169 --> 00:49:18,204
I'm starting to like
being just Olivia.

927
00:49:18,306 --> 00:49:21,273
-Tic-tac-toe! I win!
-Wh... What?

928
00:49:21,376 --> 00:49:24,310
[both laugh]

929
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:28,714
I like just Olivia.

930
00:49:39,877 --> 00:49:44,413
"in his glorious name...

931
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:46,415
Pastor Olivia."

932
00:49:46,517 --> 00:49:49,618
[chuckles softly]
they may not be on time,

933
00:49:49,721 --> 00:49:50,453
but they are in god's time.

934
00:49:50,555 --> 00:49:52,221
-You want me to help?
-No, no.

935
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:55,491
Pastor Byrd did it, so can I.

936
00:49:55,593 --> 00:49:58,694
A little secret,
I helped him.

937
00:49:58,796 --> 00:49:59,862
[chuckles]

938
00:49:59,964 --> 00:50:02,398
-[sighs] I'm gonna head out.
-Okay.

939
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,800
Want me to pick you up
a coco-lada shake?

940
00:50:04,902 --> 00:50:07,236
-Yes, please.
-See you in a bit.

941
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:07,770
Bye.

942
00:50:07,872 --> 00:50:10,206
Okay.

943
00:50:16,414 --> 00:50:19,081
-Yes...
-They're late.

944
00:50:19,951 --> 00:50:20,583
Yes.

945
00:50:20,685 --> 00:50:22,485
They will be late this year,

946
00:50:22,587 --> 00:50:25,688
but they'll get there.

947
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:27,656
I'm starting to get
a handle on things.

948
00:50:27,759 --> 00:50:30,092
-Mm-hm.
-Did you hear the choir Sunday?

949
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:32,695
Oh, they sounded amazing.

950
00:50:32,797 --> 00:50:34,797
[chuckles] I think
they're going to be ready.

951
00:50:34,899 --> 00:50:39,468
You think they're going to be
ready for exactly what?

952
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:40,970
The winter jamboree.

953
00:50:41,072 --> 00:50:43,839
Ah, the same winter jamboree
that I told you

954
00:50:43,941 --> 00:50:45,641
it was imperative to
turn in the paperwork.

955
00:50:45,743 --> 00:50:48,677
-That winter jamboree?
-Yes.

956
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:52,715
Then where in god's name
is the church on this flyer?

957
00:50:52,817 --> 00:50:55,518
Surely, not the headlining act.

958
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:57,787
No, it can't be, be...

959
00:50:57,889 --> 00:51:00,990
This can't be, because I-I
definitely turned it in.

960
00:51:01,092 --> 00:51:02,191
-I know I did...
-[ida] oh.

961
00:51:02,293 --> 00:51:05,561
[ida] this is you
handling things?

962
00:51:05,663 --> 00:51:08,764
Well, I'm gonna call an
emergency leadership meeting.

963
00:51:08,866 --> 00:51:14,236
I think we need to seriously
discuss your trial period.

964
00:51:16,641 --> 00:51:18,340
Why do you hate me?

965
00:51:20,812 --> 00:51:22,611
I don't hate you.

966
00:51:23,781 --> 00:51:25,581
You, you don't belong here.

967
00:51:25,683 --> 00:51:28,384
And you're not a leader
like my brother.

968
00:51:28,486 --> 00:51:31,287
Your brother was a
great man of god...

969
00:51:31,389 --> 00:51:36,392
And you better never forget.

Oh, no. No.
I'm Olivia.

982
00:52:24,809 --> 00:52:26,475
I'm the new pastor
over at genesis.

-Oh, yes! Yes. Hi.
-Hi.

Oh, I'm so sorry to hear
about pastor Byrd.

985
00:52:30,915 --> 00:52:32,414
That man had a heart for giving.

986
00:52:32,517 --> 00:52:34,750
And his choir, oh!
You know, it's a shame

987
00:52:34,852 --> 00:52:36,318
they won't be participating
this year.

988
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:38,487
Actually, that's what I'm
wanting to discuss.

989
00:52:38,589 --> 00:52:39,255
We want to participate.

990
00:52:39,357 --> 00:52:41,190
Oh, pastor, I'm sorry.

991
00:52:41,292 --> 00:52:43,459
That paperwork had to be
in a week ago.

992
00:52:43,561 --> 00:52:45,094
I mean, normally pastor Byrd
would've had it

993
00:52:45,196 --> 00:52:47,663
in a month in advance,
and since I didn't hear anything

994
00:52:47,765 --> 00:52:49,965
from the church, I had to
book another act.

995
00:52:50,067 --> 00:52:53,502
Mr. Hanks, I need a win here.
Okay?

996
00:52:53,604 --> 00:52:55,604
I-I can't go back to that choir
and tell them that

997
00:52:55,706 --> 00:52:57,706
all of this hard work they've
been doing is for naught.

998
00:52:57,808 --> 00:52:59,808
I forgot to turn in
the paperwork,

999
00:52:59,911 --> 00:53:02,578
that's on me, not them.
Please just...

1000
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,314
In the spirit of Christmas,
let them perform.

1001
00:53:05,416 --> 00:53:08,551
Pastor, I wish I could, but the
lineup's already booked.

1002
00:53:08,653 --> 00:53:11,086
There just isn't any room.

1003
00:53:11,822 --> 00:53:14,190
Just like with Mary and Joseph.

1004
00:53:14,292 --> 00:53:18,794
But this is the season
for miracles.

you got to share this
with the world.

Uh-uh. No.
What are you doing here?

1034

keep that to herself.

1036
00:55:39,003 --> 00:55:43,105
I cannot believe I forgot
to turn in the paperwork.

1037
00:55:43,207 --> 00:55:46,842
I don't understand how my mother
juggles this responsibility.

1038
00:55:46,944 --> 00:55:48,444
Why didn't you
just ask for help?

1039
00:55:48,546 --> 00:55:49,945
[Olivia chuckles] uh-uh. No.

1040
00:55:50,047 --> 00:55:52,514
And give sister ida, your
auntie, more ammunition?

1041
00:55:52,616 --> 00:55:55,250
You know how she loves pointing
at my grave mistakes.

1042
00:55:55,353 --> 00:55:56,518
Oh. Come on, Olivia, no.

1043
00:55:56,620 --> 00:56:00,155
-She's...
-She's grieving. I know.

1044
00:56:02,626 --> 00:56:04,660
But I think I have an idea.

1045
00:56:05,196 --> 00:56:07,963
Come up, I'll show you.

1046
00:56:11,052 --> 00:56:12,718
[Olivia] come on. Okay.

1047
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:15,387
So I found the band on the
flyer that's headlining.

1048
00:56:15,489 --> 00:56:17,823
It's a rock band,
but it's gonna work. Trust me.

1049
00:56:17,925 --> 00:56:20,526
I trust you,
but is it gonna work?

1050
00:56:20,628 --> 00:56:22,694
I've done my research.
Come on, where's my support?

1051
00:56:22,797 --> 00:56:24,630
We got this.

1052
00:56:24,732 --> 00:56:28,000
[upbeat music]

1053
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:46,785
right.
So, what do you think?

1054
00:56:46,887 --> 00:56:48,887
-They sound great.
-I know.

1055
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:51,190
Do you think they'll be
down to play gospel?

1056
00:56:51,292 --> 00:56:53,725
Oh, ye of little faith. Red.

1057
00:56:53,828 --> 00:56:55,727
-Hey. What's up?
-Hey. Hi, I'm Olivia.

1058
00:56:55,830 --> 00:57:00,232
-And this is... Ashton.
-Wassup?

1059
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:01,667
-[chuckles]
-right.

1060
00:57:01,769 --> 00:57:04,770
And you were looking for a
band to play at your church?

1061
00:57:04,872 --> 00:57:08,006
Not exactly.
I wanted to pitch an idea.

1062
00:57:08,109 --> 00:57:11,110
So, you know the choir that
normally opens the jamboree?

1063
00:57:11,212 --> 00:57:13,812
Oh, yeah.
Their sound is sweet.

1064
00:57:13,914 --> 00:57:15,414
Yeah. It is.

1065
00:57:15,516 --> 00:57:17,216
I'm actually kind of nervous
that, ah, we're replacing them,

1066
00:57:17,318 --> 00:57:18,851
'cause we don't sing,
and you know,

1067
00:57:18,953 --> 00:57:20,119
people want to hear singing.

1068
00:57:20,221 --> 00:57:23,355
Well, you know, since you
don't sing and we do,

1069
00:57:23,457 --> 00:57:25,491
how about we perform together?

1070
00:57:25,593 --> 00:57:26,925
Do what now?

1071
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:30,629
Look, I'm the new pastor
at genesis and I...

1072
00:57:30,731 --> 00:57:31,730
I forgot to submit
the paperwork.

1073
00:57:31,832 --> 00:57:34,533
-[chuckles]
-I know. Yes, that's on me.

1074
00:57:34,635 --> 00:57:35,834
But I figured
it was worth a shot

1075
00:57:35,936 --> 00:57:36,602
to see if we could collaborate.

1076
00:57:36,704 --> 00:57:38,403
Ah, but it's one week.

1077
00:57:38,506 --> 00:57:41,673
Plus, I don't know.
Rock and gospel?

1078
00:57:41,775 --> 00:57:45,043
Yeah. I'm hearing a whole
other sound all together.

1079
00:57:45,146 --> 00:57:46,945
Yeah, and we don't sing,
so voices could be cool.

1080
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:49,948
And you said yourself,
people want to hear singing.

1081
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:52,184
-[laughing] I did say that.
-That's the "gotcha."

1082
00:57:52,286 --> 00:57:54,553
[chuckles]

1083
00:57:54,655 --> 00:57:55,888
yeah.

1084
00:57:55,990 --> 00:57:57,523
[ida] rock and roll?

1085
00:57:57,625 --> 00:57:59,458
Assistant pastor,
is this is your solution?

1086
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:00,859
Now, wait a minute, ida.
Give her a chance to explain.

1087
00:58:00,961 --> 00:58:03,962
Yes. It is my solution.

1088
00:58:04,064 --> 00:58:05,597
Look, I know
I failed the church.

1089
00:58:05,699 --> 00:58:07,866
But god has given us an
opportunity for the choir

1090
00:58:07,968 --> 00:58:09,668
to perform and for us
to minister.

1091
00:58:09,770 --> 00:58:11,770
I'm not gonna
turn my back on that.

1092
00:58:11,872 --> 00:58:14,506
Besides, I believe pastor Byrd
would be honored.

1093
00:58:14,608 --> 00:58:16,942
Don't bring my brother
into this.

1094
00:58:17,044 --> 00:58:18,043
He is this.

1095
00:58:18,145 --> 00:58:20,546
He is the embodiment of
the Christmas spirit.

1096
00:58:20,648 --> 00:58:22,714
He was the servant for the king,
he loved the people

1097
00:58:22,816 --> 00:58:25,651
and the people loved him. And I
think this is a beautiful way

1098
00:58:25,753 --> 00:58:27,452
to celebrate his legacy.

1099
00:58:27,555 --> 00:58:31,690
Well, you may be on to something
there. But rock-n-roll?

1100
00:58:31,792 --> 00:58:36,361
Ain't nothing wrong with a
little prince for the prince.

1101
00:58:36,463 --> 00:58:37,963
[Stella chuckling]
yeah, sister ida.

1102
00:58:38,065 --> 00:58:40,399
I mean, kirk Franklin
had a rock song.

1103
00:58:40,501 --> 00:58:43,468
Well, you know I love me
some kirk. He's a bad boy.

1104
00:58:43,571 --> 00:58:45,571
But don't you all be bringing
the prince up in here,

1105
00:58:45,673 --> 00:58:48,273
'cause the only dove that's
going to be crying in here

1106
00:58:48,375 --> 00:58:50,008
is the prince of peace.

1107
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:54,346
Aww, bunny, you know you like
a little controversy.

1108
00:58:54,448 --> 00:58:56,582
[ida] stop, boy. Stop, boy!

1109
00:58:56,684 --> 00:59:01,053
What'd I tell you about
calling me "bunny" in public?

1110
00:59:03,123 --> 00:59:05,123
Let us never discuss that.

1111
00:59:05,226 --> 00:59:06,458
-[Stella] okay.
-Agreed.

1112
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:10,195
[chuckles] pastor,
this is going to be epic!

1113
00:59:10,297 --> 00:59:12,864
You on to something, pastor.
[chuckles]

1114
00:59:13,701 --> 00:59:16,468
your mother would be so proud.

1115
00:59:17,538 --> 00:59:19,838
Proud.

1116
00:59:22,910 --> 00:59:24,209
Thank you.

1117
00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:28,447
[indistinct chatter]

1118
00:59:28,549 --> 00:59:30,082
all right, everybody,
let's have a seat.

1119
00:59:30,184 --> 00:59:32,551
Now let's talk about
this jamboree.

1120
00:59:32,653 --> 00:59:36,054
We goin' to put a little funk
in<i> o come all ye faithful!</i>

1121
00:59:36,156 --> 00:59:37,889
[Stella giggling]

1122
00:59:37,992 --> 00:59:40,926
-so sorry. Proceed.
-Stella is correct.

1123
00:59:41,028 --> 00:59:43,228
We're going to collaborate with
red and his rock band.

1124
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:44,796
And Stella's going
to sing the lead.

1125
00:59:44,898 --> 00:59:47,733
-Really?
-Come on, y'all.

1126
00:59:47,835 --> 00:59:49,468
Pastor just forgot to turn in
the jamboree paperwork.

1127
00:59:49,570 --> 00:59:51,937
-Oh!
-What?

1128
00:59:52,039 --> 00:59:54,206
Yes... I...
Okay. Yes, I did.

1129
00:59:54,308 --> 00:59:57,609
I did. But god led me to ask
red if we could collaborate.

1130
00:59:57,711 --> 00:59:59,211
Not only in memory
of pastor Byrd,

1131
00:59:59,313 --> 01:00:01,480
but in the spirit of Christmas,
and he said yes.

1132
01:00:01,582 --> 01:00:04,549
We got our own
Christmas miracle.

1133
01:00:04,652 --> 01:00:06,184
So on that note, let's jump
on this rehearsal.

1134
01:00:06,287 --> 01:00:09,688
Y'all, this is gonna be epic.
I can feel it.

1135
01:00:09,790 --> 01:00:11,223
That's right.

1136
01:00:11,959 --> 01:00:13,792
Aw, thanks, mom.

1137
01:00:13,894 --> 01:00:17,029
Yeah, I feel...
I'm feeling much better.

1138
01:00:17,131 --> 01:00:19,765
Uh, oh, I-I got dad's new
golf clubs for Christmas,

1139
01:00:19,867 --> 01:00:21,733
and I know every year I ask you
what you want,

1140
01:00:21,835 --> 01:00:23,702
but I figured that
I would just gotta...

1141
01:00:23,804 --> 01:00:26,705
-[laughing] look at me.
-This is what you bought?

1142
01:00:26,807 --> 01:00:28,540
All right, all right, all right.

1143
01:00:28,642 --> 01:00:30,175
[destiny] oh, my god!

1144
01:00:30,277 --> 01:00:31,310
I'm sorry, mom.
What'd you say?

1145
01:00:31,412 --> 01:00:34,846
Yeah, it's gonna be great.

1146
01:00:37,651 --> 01:00:40,585
[dramatic music]

1147
01:00:45,392 --> 01:00:46,692
hey.

1148
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:51,496
-Hey.
-You look busy.

1149
01:00:51,598 --> 01:00:53,632
-Very.
-You okay?

1150
01:00:57,271 --> 01:01:00,572
Look, maybe we rushed into this
whole dating thing.

1151
01:01:00,674 --> 01:01:03,475
This "all in,
be in the moment" thing.

1152
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:05,610
Whoa, whoa.
Where is this coming from?

1153
01:01:05,713 --> 01:01:10,248
I have a lot going on,
and you have the jamboree.

1154
01:01:10,351 --> 01:01:13,352
And I really just don't have any
space for more disappointment.

1155
01:01:13,454 --> 01:01:15,954
-Disappointment?
-[Olivia] I'm failing here.

1156
01:01:16,056 --> 01:01:17,889
This whole trial period thing
is stressing me out.

1157
01:01:17,991 --> 01:01:21,293
And dealing with you and another
woman on top of it all...

1158
01:01:21,395 --> 01:01:23,362
-Another woman?
-I don't want to talk about it.

1159
01:01:23,464 --> 01:01:25,797
I just, I would really
like for you to leave.

1160
01:01:25,899 --> 01:01:28,767
-You should let me explain.
-I don't want to hear it.

1161
01:01:29,803 --> 01:01:30,469
Everybody is trying
to explain stuff,

1162
01:01:30,571 --> 01:01:36,241
and I just really need quiet.

1163
01:01:37,244 --> 01:01:38,543
Please.

1164
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:41,480
Okay.

1165
01:01:42,416 --> 01:01:44,583

Happy holidays!

Wow! She's beautiful.

You didn't tell me
she had style.

1201
01:03:53,147 --> 01:03:55,747
And this outfit is everything.

1202

-Thank you?
-Okay. I see you, big bro.

1203
01:03:58,452 --> 01:04:00,752
I see you. [chuckles]

Happy holidays.

01:04:10,931 --> 01:04:12,764
-Destiny.
-Yeah.

1210
01:04:12,866 --> 01:04:18,236
My little sis. She's in town
visiting for the holidays.

1211
01:04:18,338 --> 01:04:20,038
That's what I was
trying to tell you.

1212
01:04:20,140 --> 01:04:21,273
Yeah...

1213
01:04:22,342 --> 01:04:24,075
I'm so sorry.

1214
01:04:24,178 --> 01:04:26,678
Um, I'm glad you came.

1215
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:29,948
-I got this for you.
-Thank you.

1216
01:04:32,286 --> 01:04:33,285
Oh. Ah, wh-where are my manners?

1217
01:04:33,387 --> 01:04:37,022

Make yourself comfortable.

[miss dee sighs]

1220
01:04:47,801 --> 01:04:50,735
-well?
-It was his sister.

1221
01:04:51,672 --> 01:04:52,604
-That's the other woman?
-Yes.

1222
01:04:52,706 --> 01:04:54,973
I thought you knew
his sister was in town.

1223
01:04:55,075 --> 01:04:56,808
I didn't know
his mother was his mother.

1224
01:04:56,910 --> 01:04:58,410
I didn't know
sister ida was his aunt.

1225
01:04:58,512 --> 01:05:00,478
I did not know
he had a sister.

1226
01:05:00,581 --> 01:05:02,614
-[laughing]
-it's not funny.

1227
01:05:02,716 --> 01:05:05,016
Olivia, that man is
crazy about you.

1228
01:05:05,118 --> 01:05:06,785
Can't you see that?

1229
01:05:07,854 --> 01:05:10,522
Before you arrived, no one
could get him to play.

1230
01:05:10,624 --> 01:05:13,925
-And believe me, we tried.
-[laughs]

1231
01:05:14,027 --> 01:05:17,095

1267
01:07:08,342 --> 01:07:10,742
Oh. No, thanks. I got it.

1268
01:07:11,712 --> 01:07:13,478
You didn't open it.

1269
01:07:14,715 --> 01:07:18,183
-Oh. Right now? [laughs]
-mm-hm.

1270
01:07:18,285 --> 01:07:19,984
Okay.

1271
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:26,958
It's gorgeous.

1272
01:07:27,060 --> 01:07:29,060
My grandmother thought that
every Christmas tree

1273
01:07:29,162 --> 01:07:30,962
should be topped
with a black angel.

1274
01:07:31,064 --> 01:07:34,866
Said it was the ancestors
watching over us.

1275
01:07:36,169 --> 01:07:37,602
She's beautiful.

1276
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,907
I should go.

1277
01:07:44,411 --> 01:07:47,178
Yeah, I-I'm pretty exhausted.

1278
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:49,981
So... Oh.

1279
01:07:51,451 --> 01:07:54,419
You were amazing tonight.

1280
01:07:59,159 --> 01:08:01,459

1284
01:08:09,269 --> 01:08:12,604
[laughing] hey.
Jesus is the reason.

1285
01:08:12,706 --> 01:08:16,007
Ah. Look who is
in the Christmas spirit.

1286
01:08:16,109 --> 01:08:18,276
Where are the other two
of the three wise men?

1287
01:08:18,378 --> 01:08:20,078
Oh, they already left.

1288
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:23,615
You know, pastor, thank you
for asking me to help you.

1289
01:08:23,717 --> 01:08:25,183
Lord knows I needed a
break from ida.

1290
01:08:25,285 --> 01:08:28,420
[laughing]
but, no, truthfully.

1291
01:08:28,522 --> 01:08:30,755
It's been really nice
spending some time with you,

1292
01:08:30,857 --> 01:08:32,624
just to get to know you.

1293
01:08:32,726 --> 01:08:34,159
You good people.

1294
01:08:34,261 --> 01:08:36,060
Now, how many of these meals
we deliver in this season?

1295
01:08:36,163 --> 01:08:40,098
-Uh, about 300.
-Aw, now, that's good, pastor.

1296
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:42,867
That's 50 more than last year.

1297
01:08:42,969 --> 01:08:44,602
Pastor Byrd would be proud.

1298
01:08:44,704 --> 01:08:47,105
Mm-hm.

1299
01:08:49,276 --> 01:08:50,475
Yes!

1300
01:08:50,577 --> 01:08:53,378
[humming]
I got it.

1301
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:55,280
I did it! I did it!

1302
01:08:55,382 --> 01:08:59,117
Olivia. [laughs]

1303
01:09:00,754 --> 01:09:03,888
-yes.
-Yeah. We won't discuss that.

1304
01:09:03,990 --> 01:09:05,256
What? I can bust a move.

1305
01:09:05,358 --> 01:09:06,991
-No. [chuckles]
-boy.

1306
01:09:07,093 --> 01:09:10,361
-Are you free tonight?
-Yes.

1307
01:09:10,464 --> 01:09:11,296
All right.

1308
01:09:11,398 --> 01:09:13,264
-You saw all of that?
-All of that.

1309
01:09:13,366 --> 01:09:15,133

1311
01:09:20,757 --> 01:09:23,258
my dad brought my mom here
on their first date.

1312
01:09:24,528 --> 01:09:26,194
He was low on cash
and didn't want her to know,

1313
01:09:26,296 --> 01:09:31,766
so he packed a nice little
dinner and brought her here.

1314
01:09:31,868 --> 01:09:34,402
She thought he was
such a romantic.

1315
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:37,505
Fell in love with him
that night.

1316
01:09:37,607 --> 01:09:40,875
Now, that's a love story.

1317
01:09:42,179 --> 01:09:44,412
Speaking of love stories...

1318
01:09:45,916 --> 01:09:47,849
Would you care to join me?

1319
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:55,623
[both chuckle softly]

1320
01:09:55,725 --> 01:09:57,025

1321
01:09:59,930 --> 01:10:01,729

It's absolutely stunning.

1323
01:10:05,335 --> 01:10:06,201
You did all this?

1324
01:10:06,303 --> 01:10:08,603
[chuckles] you know
I got them skills.

1325
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:11,506
-[chuckles]
-no, this event company did it.

1326
01:10:11,608 --> 01:10:15,843
I figured I'd kick it up a
notch... 'cause I ain't broke.

1327
01:10:15,946 --> 01:10:17,278

1328

[exhales] Olivia...

1329
01:10:25,188 --> 01:10:26,988
You believed in me.

1330
01:10:28,124 --> 01:10:30,758
Reignited my passion for music.

1331
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:34,996
For that, thank you.

1332
01:10:36,066 --> 01:10:37,865
I know you're a woman of god.

1333
01:10:37,968 --> 01:10:39,667
A pastor, you need to be
out front leading,

1334
01:10:39,769 --> 01:10:42,237
and I'm with that.

1335
01:10:43,974 --> 01:10:46,274
But I want to be on this
journey with you...

1336
01:10:46,376 --> 01:10:50,945
Standing right beside you,
making you laugh.

1337
01:10:53,383 --> 01:10:57,018
My mother fell in love
with my father because...

1338
01:10:58,021 --> 01:11:02,290
He saw Etta, not a pastor.

1339
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:05,193
She said...

1340
01:11:06,796 --> 01:11:12,500
"if you fall in love,
make sure he sees you."

1341
01:11:12,602 --> 01:11:15,003
I do.

1342
01:11:18,775 --> 01:11:22,010
-[cellphone ringing]
-oh.

1343
01:11:23,813 --> 01:11:25,146
Hey, mom.

1344
01:11:25,248 --> 01:11:27,882
How...

1345
01:11:27,984 --> 01:11:29,817
Wait, what happened?

1346
01:11:29,919 --> 01:11:31,219
Slow down.

1347
01:11:32,555 --> 01:11:33,888
Oh, no.

1348
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:37,925
All right.
I'll be right there.

1349
01:11:38,028 --> 01:11:40,161
-Gosh.
-Everything okay?

1350
01:11:40,263 --> 01:11:41,095
No, it's not.

1351
01:11:41,197 --> 01:11:43,831
[Ashton]
we need to get to the theatre.

1352
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:47,468
[Olivia] okay, what is all
the commotion about?

1353
01:11:47,570 --> 01:11:48,970
Stella done lost her voice.

1354
01:11:49,072 --> 01:11:50,705
[hoarsely] I don't know
what happened.

1355
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:54,942
We tried giving her
tea and honey, mints.

1356
01:11:55,045 --> 01:11:58,179
-[Carl] nothing worked.
-Okay, okay. Nobody panic.

1357
01:11:58,281 --> 01:12:00,081
I'm not panicking,
so no one needs to panic.

1358
01:12:00,183 --> 01:12:01,249
-[Olivia] right.
-All right?

1359
01:12:01,351 --> 01:12:03,184
-A-are you panicking?
-No.

1360
01:12:03,286 --> 01:12:05,286
Does-does anyone else
know her solo?

1361
01:12:05,388 --> 01:12:08,022
Nobody can hit those high notes
like Stella.

1362
01:12:08,124 --> 01:12:09,824
I know her solo.
I can do it.

1363
01:12:09,926 --> 01:12:11,926
-Oh, lord...
-[sighs]

1364
01:12:12,028 --> 01:12:14,629
I'd rather hear a distressed
billy goat cry.

1365
01:12:14,731 --> 01:12:15,797
Brother Carl!

1366
01:12:15,899 --> 01:12:17,899
Oh, you will know the truth,

1367
01:12:18,001 --> 01:12:19,500
and the truth will set you free.

1368
01:12:19,602 --> 01:12:22,170
Okay, son, what are we gonna do?

1369
01:12:22,272 --> 01:12:23,371
The jamboree is tomorrow.

1370
01:12:23,473 --> 01:12:26,307

I know where this is going,
and it's a hard no.

1373
01:12:33,883 --> 01:12:35,249
-Pastor...
-[Olivia] no.

1374
01:12:35,352 --> 01:12:37,285
-The congregation needs you.
-Okay, don't do this.

1375
01:12:37,387 --> 01:12:38,486
-Look, you got to go on.
-Stop it.

1376
01:12:38,588 --> 01:12:41,389
-[Olivia] just stop it, okay?
-Now's the time to lead.

1377
01:12:41,491 --> 01:12:43,825
Please, stop asking me.
Don't ask me again.

1378
01:12:45,995 --> 01:12:47,762
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1379
01:12:49,766 --> 01:12:53,267
-What the...
-You wanted that.

1380
01:12:55,839 --> 01:12:58,906
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Hey! Hey, hey.

1381
01:12:59,008 --> 01:13:01,142
-I didn't mean to upset you.
-Yeah, well, you did.

1382
01:13:01,244 --> 01:13:02,877
And you embarrassed me.

1383
01:13:04,214 --> 01:13:06,080
Don't you think I want to be
there for the church?

1384
01:13:06,182 --> 01:13:08,416
-Save my job?
-Livi...

1385
01:13:08,518 --> 01:13:10,184
That's what they want, right?
A singing pastor.

1386
01:13:10,286 --> 01:13:11,953
I-I... I don't sing.

1387
01:13:12,055 --> 01:13:14,222
-Yes, you do.
-I cannot be "all in" like you.

1388
01:13:14,324 --> 01:13:16,691
-I'm not wired that way.
-Yes, you are.

1389
01:13:16,793 --> 01:13:19,060
What do you say to the
congregation every Sunday?

1390
01:13:19,162 --> 01:13:20,862
"let your faith be bigger
than your fears."

1391
01:13:20,964 --> 01:13:24,465
-not now, Ashton.
-Absolutely now, livi.

1392
01:13:24,567 --> 01:13:27,335
Look, that choir,
they need you.

1393
01:13:27,437 --> 01:13:29,470
I need you.

1394
01:13:29,572 --> 01:13:31,739
Now I'm sorry that choir
director embarrassed you,

1395
01:13:31,841 --> 01:13:36,244
hurt you, but now, you get to
stand up to her.

1396
01:13:36,346 --> 01:13:38,179
And I told you
I've got your back.

1397
01:13:38,281 --> 01:13:41,582
Even if it means
giving you a push.

1398
01:13:41,684 --> 01:13:42,350
A push?

1399
01:13:42,452 --> 01:13:44,018
Yes, out of your comfort zone,

1400
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:47,021
and into your greatness.

1401
01:13:48,825 --> 01:13:52,126
"all in." remember?

1402
01:13:53,496 --> 01:13:55,096

Should we try calling her?

1433
01:16:12,035 --> 01:16:15,970
No, she's probably backstage
praying over the choir.

Plus, I want it to be a surprise
when she sees us.

Let's grab our seats.

She's not answering
her phone either.

Did you go by the house?

1439
01:16:27,317 --> 01:16:28,916
I think we should just
give her some space.

1440
01:16:29,018 --> 01:16:30,051
She will show up.

1441
01:16:30,153 --> 01:16:33,988
Hey, guys.
They say we're on.

1442
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:36,057
All right, everybody,
I know we are nervous,

1443
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:38,159
but we didn't come this far
to turn back now.

1444
01:16:38,261 --> 01:16:41,028

01:16:49,606 --> 01:16:51,906
I'm scared.

1450
01:16:52,008 --> 01:16:54,675
That's all right,
sister Bernadette. I got you.

1451

01:22:03,352 --> 01:22:06,554
yeah!
Yes! Yes!

1538
01:22:08,691 --> 01:22:11,825
That was electrifying! I knew
you had your mama's voice!

1539
01:22:11,928 --> 01:22:13,794
Oh, we were a hit, honey.

1540
01:22:13,896 --> 01:22:15,529
And you knew about this voice?

1541
01:22:15,631 --> 01:22:16,864
Uh, my god. My god.

1542
01:22:16,966 --> 01:22:20,901
Pastor, girl, you are right
with me. You are right with me.

1543
01:22:21,003 --> 01:22:24,405
And, pastor, we'll see you
in the new year.

1544
01:22:24,507 --> 01:22:27,207
You were amazing!

1545
01:22:27,310 --> 01:22:28,976
Your voice!

1546
01:22:29,078 --> 01:22:30,411
Oh, yeah. About that.

1547
01:22:30,513 --> 01:22:32,780
I may have lied.

1548
01:22:32,882 --> 01:22:37,418
When I overheard you at the
church, I knew you had to sing.

1549
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:40,821
-I cannot believe you.
-[Stella chuckles]

1550
01:22:41,390 --> 01:22:44,191
-you better sing!
-Oh!

1551
01:22:45,928 --> 01:22:48,395
-Livi!
-Sweetheart!

1552
01:22:48,497 --> 01:22:50,998
When did you get here? Hi.

1553
01:22:51,100 --> 01:22:54,702
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

1554
01:22:54,804 --> 01:22:57,471
My singing pastor!
I knew you had it!

1555
01:22:57,573 --> 01:22:59,573
I knew you could do it, too,
baby girl.

1556
01:22:59,675 --> 01:23:02,643
-Mom, dad, this is...
-Ashton.

1557
01:23:02,745 --> 01:23:05,379
I'm so glad to finally meet you.

1558
01:23:05,481 --> 01:23:06,981
[Ashton chuckling]

1559
01:23:07,083 --> 01:23:09,583
young man, you did a fantastic
job with this choir.

1560
01:23:09,685 --> 01:23:11,719
[sighs] thank you, sir.
Thank you.

1561
01:23:11,821 --> 01:23:14,321
And those voices,
they need to go on the road.

1562
01:23:14,423 --> 01:23:15,923
You know, I was thinking
the same thing.

1563
01:23:16,025 --> 01:23:18,626
-First stop, Chicago.
-Absolutely.

1564
01:23:18,728 --> 01:23:22,529
Uh, do you mind if I have a word
with Olivia?

1565
01:23:22,632 --> 01:23:23,697
Yeah, sure.
Go ahead, son.

1566
01:23:23,799 --> 01:23:26,767
Thank you. Excuse us.

1567
01:23:28,437 --> 01:23:29,837
[Ashton] you showed up.

1568
01:23:29,939 --> 01:23:33,073
The church needed me.
I couldn't let them down.

1569
01:23:33,175 --> 01:23:36,644
You needed me.
I couldn't let you down.

1570
01:23:36,746 --> 01:23:38,612
You know, you got to be
"all in."

1571
01:23:38,714 --> 01:23:42,016
-oh. [chuckles]
-[laughing]

1572
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:48,322
