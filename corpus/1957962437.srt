0
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:12,291
You forgot

1
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:21,000
Oh my...

2
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:23,666
This is horrible.

3
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:25,625
I'm so sorry

4
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:30,500
It's okay. I know how much stress
you've been under lately.

5
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:33,750
No, no... That's no excuse

6
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,708
This is so terrible of me.

7
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:43,832
On top of that, I'm late... Can you
imagine it? Of all days

8
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:47,082
Today had to be the one for them
to send that stupid guy to come

9
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,250
So I could be relieved from duty

10
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,958
I'm so sick of this stupid job!

11
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:56,041
They just want to be stressing you out...
working you like a slave for minimum wage

12
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:59,790
I mean, what kind of nonsense is that?
Okay... Okay... Okay

13
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:04,415
It's fine. You're here now, and the day is
not over.

14
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:07,000
Go and change... let's
get this party started

15
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,874
You make it sound so simple

16
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:14,541
Okay. You know what I want
for my birthday?

17
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:20,333
I want us to have a nice romantic dinner

18
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:24,916
Then, I want us to watch a movie

19
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,249
Then... you got the idea.

20
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:35,625
But, most importantly, I want us
to not complain about anything

21
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:40,333
Let's just forget all our problems. Uh?

22
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,625
Will you give me that as my birthday gift?

23
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,291
I feel really bad

24
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:49,916
Look at that

25
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,707
I should be the one doing all that for you

26
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:55,375
So, does that mean I'm not
going to get my wish?

27
00:04:55,583 --> 00:05:00,125
Sorry. Okay, what do you want me to wear?

28
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:04,374
Something a little nicer...

29
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:07,833
With a better attitude

30
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:13,666
And... You didn't even complement me.

31
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:17,040
You don't like what you see?

32
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:18,333
What?!

33
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:21,958
You look beautiful. Absolutely stunning!

34
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,040
Alright, go and change.

35
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:28,958
Come back and bring me Superman!

36
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,083
Don't you mean black panther?

37
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:37,541
Yes... Sorry. Bring me back the king!

38
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:56,708
So what happened to the one
I sent you last year?

39
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,375
Oh, is that so?

40
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:02,916
The latest version has come out

41
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:10,000
So, the one you have
is not working anymore, right?

42
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,750
Okay

43
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:19,416
Is there anything else you
want me to buy for you?

44
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,833
Are you sure?

45
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:34,833
Okay... How about your friends?

46
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:37,466
Is there anything you want me
to buy for them?

47
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:40,916
No?

48
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,958
How about your favorite teacher?

49
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,499
No, how about your principal?

50
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:52,833
Are you sure they don't want
the latest iPod or iPhone?

51
00:06:58,541 --> 00:06:59,541
Sorry?

52
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,166
Sorry for who?

53
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,541
You better be sorry for yourself!

54
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:06,291
My friend hand over the phone to mama!

55
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,958
I said, hand the phone over!

56
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:18,332
Mama, what's the matter with that boy?

57
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:21,333
Does he think I'm plucking money
from trees here or what?

58
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:25,041
Young is not an excuse for foolishness

59
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:27,124
He's old enough to use common sense

60
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,000
Ah, ah...

61
00:07:28,001 --> 00:07:30,707
Every time, it's this
one or the other thing

62
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:31,790
Especially him!

63
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:35,040
Always asking me for things I don't
even buy for myself... Ah, ah!

64
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,749
Am I their father?

65
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:41,291
I mean, did I come here to fend for them

66
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,666
Sorry mama

67
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:58,875
Mama, I don't mean to complain...
I'm just...

68
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:05,082
It's Just a really hectic season for
me right now... that's all... I have...

69
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,750
I have lots on my plate

70
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,291
Mama, I know and...

71
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,541
I appreciate that

72
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
No mama she's not.

73
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,374
Don't worry, you'll be the first to know

74
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:27,291
Just be a little patient.
It will happen at the right time.

75
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,707
Okay Mama.

76
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,458
I hear you.

77
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,333
Alright.

78
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:39,916
Okay, Um... Mama, I have to go.
I'm running late for work

79
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:41,916
Okay.

80
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,082
All right.

81
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:45,458
Okay...

82
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,749
Alright. Okay, greetings ma.

83
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,957
Okay

84
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,500
Bye bye.

85
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,958
I'm sorry... did I wake you?

86
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:04,583
No, it's fine

87
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,708
I know I could just say no.

88
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:16,875
But, they just keep asking for money,
for clothes and things and...

89
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,758
When you say no, it just makes
you look stingy

90
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,360
meanwhile, it's them... I mean, don't
they use common wisdom

91
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:27,666
Anyway, um... you said you wanted to talk
to me about something last night

92
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:32,833
Um... Don't worry. We'll
talk about it later

93
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:38,166
Alright. Well, I'll see
you later after work

94
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:44,083
Ah, ah. Are you just going to leave
without kissing your wife goodbye?

95
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,375
I haven't brushed my teeth

96
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:16,457
- So who is infertile? You or him?
- Ah, ah..

97
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:18,957
Cynthia, what kind of question is that?

98
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,499
How rude?
Girl, we are family!

99
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,082
Who else you gonna keep it real with?

100
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:26,166
Besides, I'm only echoing what everyone
else has been asking.

101
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,583
Who's everyone else?

102
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,832
Can I get a glass please?

103
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,875
Yes, Queen Cynthia!

104
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:34,375
Ah

105
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,666
You better recognize.

106
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:44,250
So, who's everyone else?

107
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:48,500
You know, I'm really feeling
this mini kitchen

108
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,457
Really? Is that right?

109
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:55,291
Yeah, it's like a life-sized dollhouse

110
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:59,665
Well, you know I've always wanted one of
those dollhouses ever since we were kids

111
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:02,457
Yeah you could practically reach
for anything from one spot

112
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:06,375
And that's the beauty of
living in a life-sized

113
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:10,625
But Cynthia, who is everyone else?

114
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:16,000
So you haven't been receiving
any pressure from your mom?

115
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,333
My mom is everyone else?

116
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,583
Come on

117
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:31,582
Come on, you know how it is when you've
been married over nine months

118
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,833
with no baby and no belly.

119
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:37,333
I mean how long have you been
married anyway? five years?

120
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,458
Three!

121
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:42,166
Well that's well over nine months

122
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,790
Can the nice Cynthia please come
out and play now?

123
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,541
You don't think I'm being nice right now?

124
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:53,665
Anyway, for your information,
neither one of us is infertile

125
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:57,707
We're just waiting until the right time
to bring our baby into this world

126
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,124
Okay...

127
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:02,875
I know whose idea that was...
Oh Cynthia, please...

128
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:04,665
Seriously though, can I just...

129
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:07,708
Can I just be honest with
you for one moment?

130
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,458
It's that even possible?

131
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:15,582
Wow... That was a dirty play. Okay

132
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:18,458
But I'ma be a good sport.
I'm gonna let it slide this time.

133
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:23,250
You know I love you, right?

134
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:19,041
Bro, can I hold something?

135
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,750
Yes... You can hold your own pocket

136
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:25,416
Bro, there's nothing there to hold.
Just look and see how dry it is...

137
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,791
Man, It feels like harmattan.

138
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:30,125
Ah...

139
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,083
Ima, wait a minute
yes?

140
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:35,040
Are we not working the same job, with
overtime hours?

141
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,708
Plus you're the bachelor...
Yes?

142
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:39,500
Why is it that you're always the
one asking for money.

143
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:42,833
Bro, Nosa, it's not rocket science

144
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:47,208
Look, between sending money back home
and money for rent payment,

145
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,457
there's barely any money left for food;
not to mention transportation costs

146
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:52,540
But I have already told you

147
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:55,083
You need to cut your coat
according to your size.

148
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:58,125
I guess you have figured me out.
I guess, I'm a tailor...

149
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:02,249
Sit there and crack jokes. Ah...

150
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,832
I hope you know comedians in Nigeria
are making some serious money...

151
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,166
Just in case you want to do
this comedy thing

152
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:11,458
Look, I'm not interested in comedy.
I'm just a very funny person

153
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:12,708
I hear you.
Exactly

154
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:13,916
Anyway
yes?

155
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,541
You need to give up that
big apartment and...

156
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:19,125
move out of that expensive neighborhood.

157
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:22,749
You can go to a smaller apartment
or even rent like a studio or something

158
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,458
Ah! Studio?!

159
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,458
What's wrong with you?

160
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,291
I am not feeling that studio idea

161
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:29,666
Why?

162
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,458
I'm not yet married

163
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,208
And?

164
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,416
I intend to marry up in life.

165
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:42,125
I need that apartment to serve as leverage
for the kind of woman I'm searching for

166
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,625
No top notch woman, with
class and self-respect

167
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:49,749
would be interested in pulling with a guy
who's unable to pull his own weight

168
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,165
Do you understand what I'm trying to say?

169
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:53,791
So, she will be marrying your apartment?

170
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,750
Come on bro...

171
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,416
Okay, let's be real!

172
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,625
You are very lucky

173
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,833
Not a lot of women are like Efosa

174
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:05,083
As a matter of fact, she's one in a million

175
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,125
I've never met any other woman willing
to downgrade inside a marriage

176
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:10,750
What?!

177
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:13,833
So, I am a downgrade?

178
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,333
Is this your way of
indirectly insulting me?

179
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,375
Why? why would you say such a thing?

180
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,374
I'm only paying your wife a complement

181
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:23,833
I was Just hailing her.

182
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:27,165
Look, you can tell that she's
tasted the good side of life...

183
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:30,041
At least, before things fell
apart in our country.

184
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:34,125
Perhaps, it was fate
bringing both of you together

185
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:38,208
I doubted she'd have seen or considered
you if her father's wealth didn't plummet.

186
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,291
Sometimes, that's a blessing in disguise

187
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,165
Because, I believe it's those humbling
circumstances that formed such a

188
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:50,125
strong, beautiful character in her.

189
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:56,250
So yes, I'm reaping the blessing or
rather the blessings

190
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,665
Look, Ima, let me tell you something

191
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,500
There are good women out there

192
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:07,333
but you'll never find them if you're trying
to be someone or something or not

193
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,874
If a woman follows you
for your possessions,

194
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,916
she'll just end up despising you.

195
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,250
I'm telling you

196
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,958
Yes, Master Sensei

197
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,165
You speak with the knowledge
of the praying mantis

198
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,958
Okay, Mr. Comedian! Ah.

199
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:27,916
Come on, can"t you take a joke? Sorry

200
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,958
But on a serious note, I hear you

201
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,000
I'll take your advice

202
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:34,916
really?

203
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:35,833
Yeah

204
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:40,125
I'll move out of my apartment and I'll
look for a cheaper solution

205
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,250
As a matter of fact, actually...

206
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:45,083
I have a great idea...
Really

207
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,416
Yeah

208
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:49,875
So, I can move in with you guys...

209
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:53,666
and we can split the rent three ways.
What do you think about that?

210
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:56,957
You have lost you mind. Are you drunk?

211
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:01,083
You must have used alcohol
as mouthwash. Idiot!

212
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:04,874
My friend, you better move into
that little security booth

213
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,601
Chill out, ah...
Don't go find your own apartment

214
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:07,832
Something is wrong with you...

215
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,665
Look, I have a big house back home,
for your information

216
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:11,957
Big house? Yet you borrow money
every day... You're not ashamed...

217
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,749
You have to be your brother's keeper.
Why are we friends?

218
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,165
What kind of friends? Do I know you?
We are only coworkers

219
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,915
Don't talk like that
I don't know you like that.

220
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,499
Go and find your own apartments

221
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,415
You're not ashamed? Your
mates are making babies

222
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,165
and you're here borrowing money from me.

223
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:25,415
Comedian... You better
go sell some tickets...

224
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:28,207
You keep living the cheap life...
Keep living the cheap life!

225
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:31,540
But who's is borrowing money now?
Cheap life? Look at your life...

226
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:34,125
Ain't you a professional borrower?
Okay you win, I agree...

227
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,875
By the way, you still owe me...
Okay, Please calm down... You win

228
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:08,250
Okay, how about we put
your honesty to test?

229
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,291
Okay, go ahead.

230
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,416
Are you happy?

231
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:18,708
- Am I happy?
- Ah, ah... It's English I spoke

232
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,291
Yes

233
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:27,832
My honesty meter is detecting
some conflict with your answer

234
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:30,457
Your honesty meter is broken

235
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:31,957
Whatever

236
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,165
Okay, so tell me this

237
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:35,040
If you could do it all over again,

238
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:37,708
Would you still
choose Nosa over Desmond?

239
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:41,041
I can't believe I'm even entertaining this

240
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:45,750
O please, believe it,
and answer, honestly.

241
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:50,875
You're basically asking me if
I would still pick love over comfort

242
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:53,207
I don't mind comfort...

243
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:56,708
Oh believe me, there are days when
I so wish that money wasn't an issue

244
00:18:56,958 --> 00:19:02,291
But, at the end of the day,
I'd still pick love above all

245
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:05,833
See, I think in some ways you're wrong

246
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:07,208
Yeah?

247
00:19:07,209 --> 00:19:11,916
Yeah, you equate Nosa to love
and Desmond to money

248
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:13,833
That is a faulty equation

249
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:15,624
I mean, the way I see it,

250
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:20,041
Nosa is love without money and
Desmond is love with money

251
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:23,833
I know... I've seen how madly
in love with you he was

252
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:26,624
The guy was lovesick. No lie!

253
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,458
But I wasn't in love with him

254
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:30,583
That doesn't matter

255
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:36,832
he is a young, rich, handsome
prince and in love with you

256
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:39,708
You know, that is every woman's dream!

257
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:41,458
Prince?

258
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:44,416
That's a little bit of a stretch

259
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,958
His father is a chief!

260
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,166
Anyway, he has princely money.

261
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,625
Why don't you go and marry him then.

262
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,457
It's not me he wants.

263
00:19:56,458 --> 00:20:01,333
Anyways, did you see what he bought his
current girlfriend? A new convertible Benz

264
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,000
I saw it on IG

265
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,707
I guess he finally found love after all

266
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:09,833
That car is fine!

267
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,166
Babe that could have been you.

268
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:15,125
I'm happy with Nosa

269
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:19,624
I've told you. Nosa is my soulmate

270
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:24,208
My best friend! I couldn't imagine going
on this journey called life without him

271
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:29,415
That is why for richer or for poorer, in
good times and in bad times,

272
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:32,375
love is what makes life special

273
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,916
You sound like an old
R&amp;B song

274
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:39,375
Really.

275
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,832
Yes! I am the champion!

276
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:50,165
You're no champion. That was pure luck!

277
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:55,040
Luck?! Excuse me! That was pure
mathematical genius!

278
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,790
Is that so?

279
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,540
Yes and if you're looking for an excuse,

280
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:02,250
blame those oversize fingers of yours
What?!

281
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,624
These? Oversize fingers?

282
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,915
Yeah? You wanna see oversize fingers?
Nosa!

283
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:09,165
You wanna see oversize fingers?
Nosa! Nosa! No! Nosa! Please

284
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,166
No!

285
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:14,375
No! Nosa! Nosa!

286
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:17,708
Stop it!

287
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:20,750
Nosa! No!

288
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:25,708
Can you believe the delivery guy just
left Mr. Edward's package on the sidewalk?

289
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:28,499
Good think this is not our last neighbor.

290
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,541
It would have disappeared by now.

291
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:33,291
Remember when you ordered
that small camera?

292
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:37,125
Please don't remind me.

293
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:41,041
Did you at least ring the doorbell?

294
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:44,791
I don't need one more person asking
me for anymore money.

295
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:48,458
You know he can just come downstairs
and knock on the door, right?

296
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:54,458
You're so sure he's
going to raise the rent.

297
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:58,416
It's been over two years. Believe me,
he's trying to give us a heads up.

298
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:03,375
Maybe he's trying to invite you to church

299
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:07,457
Nah. He already knows the answer to that

300
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:10,249
Busy, busy, busy! No time for God.

301
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,875
What?! Is that the pot
calling the kettle black?

302
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:17,165
I am neither a pot or a pothead.
Thank you very much.

303
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:20,832
In fact, the Bible says I am a saint.

304
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:22,708
Okay, saint Efosa,

305
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:26,125
show me where in the Bible it says you
need to go to church to get to heaven

306
00:23:26,791 --> 00:23:30,249
That's not fair. Why don't you go
to the church and ask the pastor?

307
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,666
No need for that.

308
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:33,124
He can't find it either.

309
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:35,333
Because it's not there

310
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:43,208
You know, I really miss the days when we
used to go to church together

311
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:45,415
Very encouraging

312
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:48,916
And you were a lot more positive

313
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:55,666
Well, I guess I'm too negative for
you now, Saint Efosa.

314
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,708
Come and lay down next to me

315
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:12,791
I want a baby

316
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:15,458
I think it's time

317
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:22,416
The pressure is getting to you.

318
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:26,000
It's not that. My
biological clock is ticking

319
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:27,416
Seriously?

320
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,957
I thought we had to plan. What's about
nursing school? You still have what...

321
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:34,749
two years left?
Babe I'll be almost 30 by then

322
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:38,500
My mother had me at 34...
Her last born in her 40s

323
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:42,458
Did you seriously just make your
mother the standard?

324
00:24:42,958 --> 00:24:45,874
All I'm saying is, 29 is still pretty young

325
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:49,791
Even your mother won't give me rest,
if we haven't had a baby in a year

326
00:24:50,125 --> 00:24:51,957
So, it's the pressure from our
parents that's getting to you

327
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:53,666
It's not!
Babe

328
00:24:55,208 --> 00:24:56,457
We have a plan

329
00:24:56,458 --> 00:24:58,874
Let's just stick to it.

330
00:24:58,875 --> 00:25:01,249
It's not the pressure from our parents
Yes it.

331
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,875
It's not the pressure from our parents!

332
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:05,875
I hate it when you do that!

333
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:07,166
What?!

334
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:08,958
When you try and tell me how I feel.

335
00:25:09,125 --> 00:25:12,833
I just told you it's nothing to do with
our parents and you still insist

336
00:25:13,291 --> 00:25:15,083
Gosh, I hate that!

337
00:25:15,791 --> 00:25:16,791
Sorry

338
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:21,749
Why don't you just let me tell you
how I feel and listen to me?

339
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,457
I said I'm sorry.

340
00:25:23,458 --> 00:25:26,374
Okay. Go ahead, talk I'm listening

341
00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:28,500
Stop over-reacting.

342
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:30,833
You see?

343
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,583
You see? there you go again.
Oh come on, what now? Ah...

344
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:39,790
You know what? I don't
feel like talking anymore.

345
00:25:39,791 --> 00:25:42,191
Seriously? You're just going to
leave me here just like that?

346
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:44,416
Efosa!
Leave me alone

347
00:25:44,458 --> 00:25:45,458
Efosa!

348
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:47,333
Efosa!

349
00:25:54,625 --> 00:25:57,540
Now police say a group of men randomly beat

350
00:25:57,541 --> 00:25:59,958
a 39 year old man to the
ground and rubbed him.

351
00:26:09,541 --> 00:26:11,291
How are you doing?

352
00:26:12,791 --> 00:26:16,082
Sorry mammy, I didn't want
to shock you or anything

353
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:18,041
That's okay

354
00:26:21,166 --> 00:26:22,166
Listen,

355
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:25,125
I think my mother likes you

356
00:26:25,916 --> 00:26:29,791
I know she can't talk, but I can tell

357
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:35,833
You know, I like you too.

358
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,125
I didn't like the other Aide. She was too
stuck-up and had an attitude. But you don't

359
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:46,458
Even if you're far more prettier than her

360
00:26:54,416 --> 00:26:58,333
You know, I don't see a lot of African
women that pretty. What part you're from?

361
00:26:58,666 --> 00:27:00,166
Wakanda?

362
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:05,750
I know it's not a real place

363
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:13,500
but check this out; If you were a queen,
what kinda queen you would be?

364
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:20,083
My kinda Queen!

365
00:27:20,625 --> 00:27:23,916
Get the joke? Wa kinda queen...
Ma kanda queen

366
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:25,125
I get it.

367
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:45,790
So wait, is he getting physical with you?

368
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:47,750
No, it's not that.

369
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:52,415
So, then like what? Is he asking you out to
dinner, on a date, or something like that?

370
00:27:52,416 --> 00:27:54,541
No, it's just

371
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:56,791
Constant compliments.

372
00:27:56,916 --> 00:28:00,582
Compliments? Mira please! I wish somebody
would be complimenting me all day

373
00:28:00,583 --> 00:28:02,165
I'ma send my boyfriend to him

374
00:28:02,166 --> 00:28:04,642
Trust me, this is not the sort of man
you want your boyfriend around

375
00:28:04,666 --> 00:28:10,458
He has this weird vibe. He's
just very weird and creepy

376
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:14,082
My guts just don't agree with him

377
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:17,249
Well, remember what they said in training...
Sometimes, you gotta trust your gut.

378
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,166
I know. And that's my dilemma

379
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:21,332
Can I really ask them to transfer me

380
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:24,583
because my guts don't agree
with the son of my clients?

381
00:28:25,541 --> 00:28:27,375
I don't know.

382
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:31,041
Plus, you know how long it took them
to give me this reassignment

383
00:28:31,541 --> 00:28:34,916
That'll be like the third one in
less than two months

384
00:28:35,416 --> 00:28:36,832
I don't know.

385
00:28:36,833 --> 00:28:38,208
Anyway

386
00:29:16,958 --> 00:29:18,458
Good afternoon sir

387
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:20,708
Hello Nosa.

388
00:29:21,041 --> 00:29:23,208
You were just on my mind

389
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:26,083
Thank you.

390
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:28,750
I've been meaning to talk with you

391
00:29:31,833 --> 00:29:33,708
It's about your rent

392
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:38,625
First of all, let me say how pleased I am
to have you guys as my tenants

393
00:29:38,958 --> 00:29:42,250
It honestly feels more like
family living downstairs

394
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:45,832
And I especially want to thank you for
how you've been voluntarily taking the

395
00:29:45,833 --> 00:29:48,333
garbage out for the house on pickup days.

396
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:50,708
That has been such a relief for me

397
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:52,833
That's okay. It's not a problem sir.

398
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:55,415
So, you know your two-year
lease is ending next month.

399
00:29:55,416 --> 00:29:59,833
And as that, a renewal usually
comes with an increase in rent

400
00:30:03,958 --> 00:30:07,916
However, I have a proposal for
you, if you're interested

401
00:30:08,958 --> 00:30:09,958
okay

402
00:30:11,666 --> 00:30:16,540
I was thinking, if you could help with
the house maintenance, things like

403
00:30:16,541 --> 00:30:20,791
Mowing the lawn regularly or blowing the
leaves. Shoveling the snow during winter

404
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,583
Things of that nature.

405
00:30:22,875 --> 00:30:28,666
I'm thinking, I can knock $150
off your monthly rent

406
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:34,416
okay I'll knock off $200

407
00:30:36,291 --> 00:30:40,457
Yes, yes! Yes, I'll do it!
Great. We have a deal.

408
00:30:40,458 --> 00:30:42,458
Thank you sir

409
00:31:28,458 --> 00:31:30,666
What are these for?

410
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:35,958
They're for Cynthia. She left them here.

411
00:31:36,375 --> 00:31:37,500
She came here?

412
00:31:38,166 --> 00:31:39,583
You didn't mention that to me

413
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,958
Is she forbidden from visiting?

414
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:44,458
Oh come on, you know I feel about her.

415
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,375
Well, she's family, and she happens to
be one of my closest friends.

416
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:51,458
Yeah. Very arrogant and snobbish friend.

417
00:31:51,708 --> 00:31:53,750
She's human.

418
00:31:55,041 --> 00:31:56,875
We all have flaws.

419
00:32:04,958 --> 00:32:06,125
Well,

420
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:09,749
don't worry, once we make millions

421
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,708
you won't have to wash
your clothes anymore

422
00:32:11,791 --> 00:32:14,125
We can just hire servants just for that

423
00:32:14,416 --> 00:32:17,000
I don't have a problem
washing my own clothes

424
00:32:18,583 --> 00:32:23,000
Well, if I had my own way, I wouldn't
want my wife to lift a finger

425
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:43,958
I've been thinking about this baby thing

426
00:32:44,541 --> 00:32:47,416
I know how much it means to you
You don't have to do me any favors

427
00:32:47,458 --> 00:32:50,416
Oh come on, I'm really trying here

428
00:32:56,958 --> 00:32:58,541
Sorry

429
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:02,333
I'm sorry for not hearing you

430
00:33:03,375 --> 00:33:04,416
I don't know, maybe...

431
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,083
Maybe I'm the one who's not
handling the pressure well

432
00:33:09,208 --> 00:33:12,790
I know you family didn't think you were
making the right choice marrying me

433
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:15,333
in fact if not for this visa lottery,

434
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,332
I wouldn't have stood a chance

435
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:18,957
You knew where I stood

436
00:33:18,958 --> 00:33:20,958
Yes, I know but

437
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:25,040
I don't know if as a man I could have
asked you to make such sacrifice

438
00:33:25,041 --> 00:33:26,916
to marry into such poverty

439
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,208
I will always be grateful to God for
coming through so timely.

440
00:33:32,375 --> 00:33:36,750
So, you know my expectations were very
high leaving Nigeria to come to America

441
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:41,708
But, sometimes it just feels like

442
00:33:42,041 --> 00:33:47,832
Like God just did me this one big favor
and was like, you're on own from here.

443
00:33:47,833 --> 00:33:50,499
Oh, that's not true.
I'm not saying it is

444
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,916
I'm just saying how I feel.

445
00:33:53,625 --> 00:33:56,583
And you accuse me of
not listening to you

446
00:33:56,958 --> 00:34:01,208
Please Continue, I'm listening.

447
00:34:05,458 --> 00:34:08,291
We've been in this country
for over three years

448
00:34:09,666 --> 00:34:12,958
I expected that by we'll be
doing way better than this

449
00:34:13,125 --> 00:34:17,583
I expected that by now we'll have something
to show for the amount of time spent

450
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:21,457
And on the other hand, the financial
responsibilities is enough stress

451
00:34:21,458 --> 00:34:24,458
for someone to just want to run
and go back home

452
00:34:24,916 --> 00:34:28,375
I mean, we could be living in a better
and bigger apartment than this

453
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:32,250
but I've to subject you to this dungeon,
just to save money for dependents

454
00:34:32,291 --> 00:34:34,457
that are not even my own children

455
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:37,333
It's a sacrifice that I'm gladly making

456
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:41,125
And please don't call my
house a dungeon again.

457
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:42,583
My bad

458
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:48,124
You know, the fact that we're able to
help take care of so many people

459
00:34:48,125 --> 00:34:50,000
is a huge accomplishments

460
00:34:50,458 --> 00:34:51,874
Do you think that if we were back home,

461
00:34:51,875 --> 00:34:55,499
and you had finished school, even if you
had gotten a job as a civil servant,

462
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,875
that you'd be able to do the same thing?

463
00:34:58,958 --> 00:35:01,208
I know there's a lot of pressure

464
00:35:01,875 --> 00:35:03,916
But it's not coming from me

465
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:12,208
Don't you ever wish for
better circumstances?

466
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:15,375
Of course

467
00:35:16,666 --> 00:35:21,250
sometimes it gets really hard,
especially in the Winter

468
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,750
But even on the worst days, you're the one
that helps me on... You give me hope.

469
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:36,791
So let me ask you this

470
00:35:39,458 --> 00:35:44,583
Have you ever wondered what it would
be like if you married Desmond?

471
00:35:51,625 --> 00:35:53,208
Yes

472
00:35:54,916 --> 00:35:56,791
I've wondered.

473
00:35:57,333 --> 00:35:59,625
But, I've never wished it

474
00:36:31,166 --> 00:36:34,791
Did you hear about the
death of my friend, Edun?

475
00:36:35,166 --> 00:36:39,708
Yes. Sorry for the loss. What a tragedy

476
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Isn't it?

477
00:36:41,541 --> 00:36:47,625
Simple illnesses that should be irrelevant,
is just claiming lives over there

478
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:50,750
What sort of a country is that?

479
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,250
You know what that country needs?

480
00:36:57,041 --> 00:37:01,040
Young, educated minds, with proper vision
Yes

481
00:37:01,041 --> 00:37:05,333
These recycled leaders are old, and have
lost their vision, if they ever had one.

482
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:11,666
Can you imagine that in this Era,
they still don't have stable electricity?

483
00:37:12,458 --> 00:37:13,458
Ha!

484
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,541
Please give us young innovators!

485
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,125
Look at how our young Artists are
making waves on a global level

486
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,291
That's only parts of the solution

487
00:37:21,416 --> 00:37:23,957
What we really need are
leaders with a heart,

488
00:37:23,958 --> 00:37:26,249
True
with love and compassion for the people

489
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,041
Exactly!

490
00:37:27,042 --> 00:37:30,000
I mean, anyone can get a degree;
even the devil is very educated

491
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:32,749
Ha! Nosa for president

492
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,958
O please, I'm not at all interested.

493
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:37,832
I hope you see this? can you see it?

494
00:37:37,833 --> 00:37:40,249
This is one of the major
issues with our citizens

495
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:42,665
Everybody complains, but nobody
wants to step forward to make change

496
00:37:42,666 --> 00:37:44,791
Go and sit down!

497
00:37:56,416 --> 00:37:58,958
Efe, I'm boiling Eggs. You want some?

498
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:03,416
No my love, I don't
want to be late for work

499
00:38:16,458 --> 00:38:18,000
I'm leaving

500
00:38:20,125 --> 00:38:22,207
One of these days that'd soon
be a nurse's uniform

501
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,583
Ah! Amen

502
00:38:24,458 --> 00:38:27,958
Listen, I have some plans
I want to run by you

503
00:38:28,291 --> 00:38:30,582
I think you'll actually favor them
Really?

504
00:38:30,583 --> 00:38:31,666
Yes

505
00:38:32,833 --> 00:38:33,833
Later.

506
00:38:34,625 --> 00:38:38,041
I thought they said you're not
allowed to wear jewelry at work

507
00:38:39,291 --> 00:38:40,291
What?

508
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:47,457
Oh... um, I don't think
they meant wedding rings.

509
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:49,957
Oh, okay. Alright

510
00:38:49,958 --> 00:38:52,208
enjoy your day

511
00:40:52,916 --> 00:40:56,791
I'm not going back to
that assignment... No way!

512
00:41:02,583 --> 00:41:03,916
What?!

513
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:11,958
What?! No! That's not true!

514
00:41:12,625 --> 00:41:14,916
He tried to rape me!

515
00:41:16,416 --> 00:41:19,291
He tried to rape me

516
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:36,041
So, like I said, I've been really thinking
about how to make this baby plan work

517
00:41:36,291 --> 00:41:40,290
So, I've been doing some major research
and I think I have a solid plan

518
00:41:40,291 --> 00:41:44,915
So, just a few days ago I ran into Stanley. He
used to work at Brilliant Security Guards...

519
00:41:44,916 --> 00:41:46,916
Remember the one I used
to work with before?

520
00:41:47,291 --> 00:41:51,165
So we're catching up and I discover he's
no longer working security.

521
00:41:51,166 --> 00:41:52,665
He's now doing taxi

522
00:41:52,666 --> 00:41:56,874
And I can just see cause, funny enough,
the time we were working together,

523
00:41:56,875 --> 00:42:00,707
we used to brainstorm the idea of taxi and,
coincidentally, I run into him on the block

524
00:42:00,708 --> 00:42:03,208
I mean, is that a confirmation or what?

525
00:42:03,458 --> 00:42:04,458
Man...

526
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,125
Listen...

527
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:09,957
If I put in the time I
put in security into taxi,

528
00:42:09,958 --> 00:42:11,749
Especially if I own my own car,

529
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:15,000
huh! O girl, my love, this is a major hit!

530
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:19,000
We can even start shooting for the baby
sooner than planned. I'm thinking like...

531
00:42:19,458 --> 00:42:22,625
October, November, you know,
after a fall semester...

532
00:42:22,875 --> 00:42:25,250
That way we'll be expecting by summer break

533
00:42:27,416 --> 00:42:30,125
See I told you I really put some
serious thought into this

534
00:42:30,916 --> 00:42:33,208
Come on, you're not saying anything

535
00:42:33,458 --> 00:42:35,208
So what do you think?

536
00:42:35,833 --> 00:42:39,458
Um... It sounds interesting

537
00:42:40,083 --> 00:42:41,125
Interest?

538
00:42:41,333 --> 00:42:43,083
Oh... Okay...

539
00:42:43,208 --> 00:42:45,665
Okay, you're worried about the
financial aspect, right? Okay.

540
00:42:45,666 --> 00:42:53,333
Look, this whole taxi plan will run
us a little over... Like $5,000...

541
00:42:53,583 --> 00:42:57,665
That's including the fees, TLC license,
documents, insurance...

542
00:42:57,666 --> 00:43:00,083
And even down payment for
financing a new car

543
00:43:00,291 --> 00:43:02,375
So, how are we going
to get the money? Okay.

544
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:07,749
Well, already we're saving for the fall
semester... that's not due till, what?

545
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:11,165
October, right? So, I mean if I
start doing the taxi,

546
00:43:11,166 --> 00:43:13,749
We can raise the money
by like, August ending.

547
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:15,165
I mean, I'll still be
doing my security hours

548
00:43:15,166 --> 00:43:20,457
Just less hours; not too much, so
I can still - That's only $2,000

549
00:43:20,458 --> 00:43:24,583
Just hold on... wait, wait, wait first.
Just... Hear the whole plan, okay?

550
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:28,957
Um... Okay so... if I double
up on my hours,

551
00:43:28,958 --> 00:43:31,582
I'll talk to my Supervisor... That
shouldn't be a big problem

552
00:43:31,583 --> 00:43:33,374
You can still maintain your same hours

553
00:43:33,375 --> 00:43:34,957
Overtime is not necessary

554
00:43:34,958 --> 00:43:37,499
Unless you want to... I mean,
that could always help.

555
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,333
But I think,

556
00:43:39,833 --> 00:43:43,791
between both our checks we
can raise like... let's see...

557
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:47,999
$4,000 by August... And, yeah, hopefully

558
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,875
if this new assignment goes steady
before the end of summer, we can do that.

559
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,916
You don't think it'll work.

560
00:43:57,125 --> 00:43:59,624
Babe, Seriously,
I've been really thinking about this

561
00:43:59,625 --> 00:44:03,541
I mean, even running into Stanley,
isn't... Isn't that like a sign?

562
00:44:04,791 --> 00:44:07,333
It's not that
No?

563
00:44:07,875 --> 00:44:09,958
Then what?

564
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:20,499
Babe, what's wrong? What's wrong?

565
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,500
What happened?

566
00:44:23,916 --> 00:44:25,124
Babe, what happened?

567
00:44:25,125 --> 00:44:26,916
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

568
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,000
It's okay... It's okay... What's going on?

569
00:45:04,583 --> 00:45:05,750
Sorry.

570
00:45:06,125 --> 00:45:08,458
I should have told you.

571
00:45:09,208 --> 00:45:12,125
I just didn't want to add more
stress to your plate

572
00:45:12,208 --> 00:45:13,958
Sorry for what?

573
00:45:14,291 --> 00:45:17,208
You have nothing to be sorry about

574
00:45:17,708 --> 00:45:21,874
That bastard is going to
be so sorry... I swear!

575
00:45:21,875 --> 00:45:26,458
That's another reason why I didn't tell you

576
00:45:27,041 --> 00:45:28,583
Just...

577
00:45:29,875 --> 00:45:33,749
Let it go, please. I've already
filed a police report.

578
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:37,040
I can't believe he also filed
a police report. How dare he?!

579
00:45:37,041 --> 00:45:39,125
Nosa, let it go

580
00:45:44,666 --> 00:45:48,458
The truth will come out

581
00:46:15,333 --> 00:46:19,041
I'm so sorry. This is all my fault.

582
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,207
Nosa, please don't do that

583
00:46:22,208 --> 00:46:24,500
If you didn't have to work, this
would have never happened

584
00:46:24,583 --> 00:46:29,791
No! Stop it! Don't do that to yourself.
This has nothing to do with that

585
00:46:50,833 --> 00:46:53,291
I don't want you to work anymore.

586
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,541
Why?

587
00:46:56,291 --> 00:46:58,875
I'll request more hours.
Don't worry, we'll be fine.

588
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:01,707
No. I want to work... I'm going to work

589
00:47:01,708 --> 00:47:05,916
Please. Please... Let's not argue over this

590
00:47:06,458 --> 00:47:09,666
I need you to respect my
decision as your husband

591
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:15,000
It's very important to me. Please

592
00:48:13,125 --> 00:48:16,041
Where is the stupid paper?

593
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,875
What are you looking for?

594
00:48:23,666 --> 00:48:28,125
It's a telephone number I wrote on a
piece of paper and I put it in my wallet.

595
00:48:29,041 --> 00:48:31,291
Oh... I hate when this happens! Ah!

596
00:48:31,583 --> 00:48:34,000
Maybe try checking your wallet.

597
00:48:34,875 --> 00:48:37,415
Okay... Okay... Don't kill me

598
00:48:37,416 --> 00:48:40,458
I'm assuming you think
you left it in your pants.

599
00:48:41,958 --> 00:48:42,958
Okay

600
00:48:43,333 --> 00:48:46,458
Why don't you try checking in the
top drawer of your night stand?

601
00:48:46,666 --> 00:48:47,999
Why don't you just help me look for it...

602
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,333
instead of asking me
a thousand questions?

603
00:48:50,625 --> 00:48:53,666
Boss, please don't be upset.
I'm just trying to help.

604
00:48:54,041 --> 00:48:56,332
Whenever I do laundry, I normally
check your pockets

605
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:59,374
and take whatever I find out, and put
it in the top drawer of the nightstand.

606
00:48:59,375 --> 00:49:01,541
That's why I'm asking

607
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:10,666
Boss, please don't be angry... but why
is this number so important anyway?

608
00:49:24,541 --> 00:49:28,958
My field supervisor, Tunde, travelled about
two weeks ago and we have this new guy

609
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,124
covering for him. He's acting really shady.
He doesn't want to give me any hours.

610
00:49:33,125 --> 00:49:36,458
He's acting like it's his father's
company or something.

611
00:49:39,125 --> 00:49:42,083
Anyway, before Tunde left, he
gave me his telephone number

612
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,624
And he's close with the owner. So I want to

613
00:49:44,625 --> 00:49:47,833
reach out to him and see if he can
put in a word for me

614
00:49:48,583 --> 00:49:51,125
You know how much we really need this.

615
00:50:08,541 --> 00:50:09,791
It's not there.

616
00:50:12,625 --> 00:50:15,916
I don't understand

617
00:50:27,583 --> 00:50:30,000
What about safety?

618
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:41,750
So, you're saying, you can't place me
because he filed a police report?

619
00:50:51,791 --> 00:50:52,916
Really?

620
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,625
Two months

621
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,375
wait...

622
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:49,415
On another note, I know you've heard

623
00:51:49,416 --> 00:51:50,833
Heard what?

624
00:51:51,125 --> 00:51:54,916
Come on... You know what
I'm talking about

625
00:51:56,541 --> 00:51:59,207
It's trending all over social media

626
00:51:59,208 --> 00:52:00,416
Desmond?

627
00:52:00,833 --> 00:52:02,291
So you have heard.

628
00:52:02,541 --> 00:52:03,666
Isn't that crazy?

629
00:52:03,708 --> 00:52:05,708
First of all, it's not trending...

630
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,958
But you still managed to hear

631
00:52:08,666 --> 00:52:12,249
Do I smell, some sort of interest
in other people's affairs?

632
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:15,665
You... Shamelessly posted it all over IG

633
00:52:15,666 --> 00:52:19,249
Ah ah... Why do you get so much
pleasure from people's pain?

634
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:22,500
Oh please... You make it
sound like somebody died

635
00:52:22,708 --> 00:52:24,415
They only broke up, for crying out loud

636
00:52:24,416 --> 00:52:28,708
Or, should I say, he broke up with her

637
00:52:29,541 --> 00:52:32,332
So you don't see any pain there?

638
00:52:32,333 --> 00:52:34,458
What? Of course there's pain.

639
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,249
But, that's a part of life.

640
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:37,790
She'll get over it

641
00:52:37,791 --> 00:52:41,166
Plus, it's probably best for her anyways

642
00:52:43,041 --> 00:52:45,290
Cynthia you're cold...

643
00:52:45,291 --> 00:52:47,833
Ah come on, you know that's not true.

644
00:52:47,916 --> 00:52:52,125
I have insights. I'm
speaking intelligently.

645
00:52:53,041 --> 00:52:55,915
What kind of insights?

646
00:52:55,916 --> 00:52:57,874
Oh, I thought you were not interested...

647
00:52:57,875 --> 00:53:00,832
Cynthia, if you don't talk right now, I'll
jump over this table and strangle you...

648
00:53:00,833 --> 00:53:03,957
Ah... My sister, violence
is never the answer

649
00:53:03,958 --> 00:53:06,291
Come on, tell me...

650
00:53:08,541 --> 00:53:12,166
He broke up with her because
he doesn't love her

651
00:53:13,083 --> 00:53:15,208
What?!
mmhmm yep.

652
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,208
And I commend him for that

653
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:21,041
It shows honesty and integrity...

654
00:53:21,333 --> 00:53:23,208
He didn't even asked for the car back

655
00:53:24,083 --> 00:53:25,458
Wow...

656
00:53:26,333 --> 00:53:28,708
So how did you know he
wasn't in love with her?

657
00:53:29,791 --> 00:53:30,875
He told me

658
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,625
He told you?

659
00:53:34,208 --> 00:53:36,541
Exactly what I just said

660
00:53:36,958 --> 00:53:39,208
As in, he spoke to you on the phone?

661
00:53:40,291 --> 00:53:42,791
Why do you sound so surprised? We talk.

662
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:47,874
Why would he be sharing intimate
aspects of his relationships with you?

663
00:53:47,875 --> 00:53:51,625
Ah ah... Like I said, we talk.

664
00:53:52,041 --> 00:53:54,291
And quite often.

665
00:53:55,125 --> 00:53:57,291
How come you never told me this before?

666
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,916
Efosa, you are a happily married woman

667
00:54:02,541 --> 00:54:04,499
I thought such things wouldn't interest you

668
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,750
Yeah, I know, but still...

669
00:54:08,208 --> 00:54:12,375
Don't forget I knew him before you.
I practically introduced you both

670
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:18,583
Because I saw this dazzling potential

671
00:54:18,958 --> 00:54:20,750
But you shut it down

672
00:54:21,125 --> 00:54:23,791
Was I supposed to banish him for my
friendship?

673
00:54:25,666 --> 00:54:28,416
So, you guys have been in
touch all this while?

674
00:54:29,791 --> 00:54:33,208
Well, we maintained our friendship

675
00:54:34,041 --> 00:54:37,000
And you talk often?

676
00:54:37,875 --> 00:54:42,541
Well, in different seasons...
Look, I'll put it this way

677
00:54:42,916 --> 00:54:47,625
We may not talk for a while, but when we
do, we just pick up where we left off.

678
00:54:47,833 --> 00:54:50,416
He's that cool.

679
00:54:52,416 --> 00:54:54,582
Now who's got a special interest in him?

680
00:54:54,583 --> 00:54:58,332
Oh no, no, no... and definitely
not on his part

681
00:54:58,333 --> 00:55:03,457
In fact, you would be quite interested
to find out the real reason

682
00:55:03,458 --> 00:55:08,874
why he broke up with his girlfriend. Even
though he did tell me in confidentiality...

683
00:55:08,875 --> 00:55:10,624
real reason?

684
00:55:10,625 --> 00:55:14,125
But you said it was because he
wasn't in love with her anymore.

685
00:55:15,041 --> 00:55:16,375
True...

686
00:55:18,958 --> 00:55:23,249
But that's because he's still in
love with somebody else...

687
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:24,375
Who?

688
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
What?

689
00:55:32,291 --> 00:55:33,416
Stop!

690
00:55:33,916 --> 00:55:35,541
Honest to god.

691
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,583
You're it baby.

692
00:55:38,541 --> 00:55:39,541
No...

693
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,583
Please be serious...

694
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,625
I'm serious... I'm not kidding!

695
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:52,041
Look, Desmond was in love with
you, that deep. Okay?

696
00:55:52,708 --> 00:55:54,790
He said he will not marry another woman

697
00:55:54,791 --> 00:55:57,083
unless he feels that kind of love.

698
00:55:57,458 --> 00:55:59,416
His exact words.

699
00:55:59,625 --> 00:56:01,875
Cross my heart.

700
00:56:12,041 --> 00:56:16,958
Nosa: Okay, okay. So do you know
anyone that might have his number?

701
00:56:19,458 --> 00:56:21,583
I already asked him.
He said he doesn't have it.

702
00:56:21,791 --> 00:56:24,458
Anyway, do you know when
he's scheduled to come back to work?

703
00:56:25,708 --> 00:56:26,708
What?

704
00:56:26,833 --> 00:56:28,193
That's almost two months from now!

705
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,958
Okay, okay, okay... Bye. Bye. Ah..

706
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:38,166
What kind of stuff is this now?

707
00:57:07,416 --> 00:57:13,250
Five thousand dollars!
Honey I almost fainted. Ah!

708
00:57:13,291 --> 00:57:16,290
I knew she was going to help us. But I
thought she was going to give us two,

709
00:57:16,291 --> 00:57:19,040
maybe five hundred dollars at most.

710
00:57:19,041 --> 00:57:21,458
When I saw that extra zero on that check?

711
00:57:21,625 --> 00:57:23,457
I couldn't believe it!

712
00:57:23,458 --> 00:57:24,375
Ha!

713
00:57:24,376 --> 00:57:28,750
This is the wildest thing that has
happened to us in a long time!

714
00:57:29,458 --> 00:57:30,749
Wow!

715
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:34,291
Cynthia! Wow! Ah!

716
00:57:34,875 --> 00:57:36,041
Ah!

717
00:57:36,166 --> 00:57:38,332
Life is so unpredictable at times

718
00:57:38,333 --> 00:57:39,666
Ah!

719
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,791
I appreciate her thoughtfulness.

720
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:51,707
This is like a dream
I know!

721
00:57:51,708 --> 00:57:53,166
But...

722
00:57:53,583 --> 00:57:55,625
We can't accept this.

723
00:57:56,666 --> 00:57:57,666
What?

724
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:01,624
I just wish you

725
00:58:01,625 --> 00:58:04,415
politely refused initially. Now it's just

726
00:58:04,416 --> 00:58:07,583
going to be really awkward
when we have to give it back

727
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:10,583
What are you talking about?

728
00:58:19,916 --> 00:58:21,250
You're joking...

729
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:24,791
You almost had me.

730
00:58:25,666 --> 00:58:29,041
I'm not joking. I'm very serious.

731
00:58:32,208 --> 00:58:33,208
Nosa

732
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,166
To be honest, I'm kind of
disappointed in you

733
00:58:39,375 --> 00:58:41,290
Nosa, what... What are you talking about?

734
00:58:41,291 --> 00:58:42,791
Is that what you do?

735
00:58:43,125 --> 00:58:46,625
Going running around, to talk to Cynthia
about our personal struggles?

736
00:58:48,166 --> 00:58:49,916
Nosa,
Ha!

737
00:58:51,166 --> 00:58:53,458
By now, the whole town must have heard

738
00:58:54,375 --> 00:58:55,624
They must be thinking,

739
00:58:55,625 --> 00:58:57,583
Wow, I can't even take care of my wife

740
00:58:57,916 --> 00:58:59,750
Oh they warned you, but you won't listen.

741
00:59:00,041 --> 00:59:03,040
I won't be surprised if there's a song
that comes out in the next few days

742
00:59:03,041 --> 00:59:04,374
about this tragedy!

743
00:59:04,375 --> 00:59:08,416
What a foolish girl! She
chose a beggar over a Prince!

744
00:59:09,458 --> 00:59:11,666
Nosa, what are you talking about?

745
00:59:11,958 --> 00:59:15,165
I don't know what's going on with you,
but you better snap out of it

746
00:59:15,166 --> 00:59:17,958
No! You're the one that
needs to snap out of it!

747
00:59:18,458 --> 00:59:21,290
I will be damned if I allow Cynthia
make a mockery of me

748
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:23,875
or you, for that matter!

749
00:59:26,125 --> 00:59:28,750
Is that what this is about?

750
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,041
Your pride?

751
00:59:32,291 --> 00:59:35,708
Did you ask her or did she volunteer it?

752
00:59:36,791 --> 00:59:38,333
What?
You heard me!

753
00:59:38,625 --> 00:59:41,874
Nosa, I've already told you. I was Just as
shocked as you are when she gave it to me

754
00:59:41,875 --> 00:59:45,208
So, why would she offer to help you
if you didn't go crying or running to her?

755
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:47,582
How did she know the exact
amount we talked about?

756
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:48,874
She didn't put your name on the check.

757
00:59:48,875 --> 00:59:51,458
She wrote mine in bold!

758
00:59:52,666 --> 00:59:55,625
Nosa, I've never known
you to be this Petty

759
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:01,874
Alright, go ahead. Insult me. disrespect me

760
01:00:01,875 --> 01:00:04,582
I have always given you
the utmost of respect

761
01:00:04,583 --> 01:00:07,458
If that is the case,
respect my decision now!

762
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:12,040
Henceforth, you cannot discuss our
personal affairs or issues with her.

763
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:14,124
Call her, first thing in the morning,

764
01:00:14,125 --> 01:00:16,041
and let her know our decision!

765
01:00:19,375 --> 01:00:21,125
I will gladly call her!

766
01:00:21,416 --> 01:00:23,416
In fact, I'll call her tonight

767
01:00:23,916 --> 01:00:25,874
just show me something.

768
01:00:25,875 --> 01:00:31,000
Give me another $5,000 check... or 4000...
You know what, I'll even takes $3,000

769
01:00:31,541 --> 01:00:35,958
Something! Just something that
justifies this pride of yours.

770
01:00:38,916 --> 01:00:40,833
I may not be rich,

771
01:00:41,583 --> 01:00:46,291
but I have self-respect and nobody
will ever take that away from me

772
01:00:46,666 --> 01:00:47,874
Nobody!
No

773
01:00:47,875 --> 01:00:50,165
Not you, and definitely, not Cynthia!

774
01:00:50,166 --> 01:00:51,832
This is not self-respect Nosa

775
01:00:51,833 --> 01:00:56,290
This is pride! Pride! And you want
to kill us with it!

776
01:00:56,291 --> 01:00:58,999
Not with hunger but with pride!

777
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,375
Ah ah!

778
01:01:00,791 --> 01:01:03,833
I know men who have way more money

779
01:01:04,208 --> 01:01:11,083
way more self-respect, that have sunk to
their knees and thanked God for a lot less!

780
01:01:12,125 --> 01:01:14,625
What you need to do, Nosa,

781
01:01:14,833 --> 01:01:18,458
is call her and say, thank you!

782
01:01:49,333 --> 01:01:55,999
How dare you? How dare you take the
gesture from my friend, my dear friend,

783
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,750
and just splits on its like that!

784
01:01:58,708 --> 01:02:02,040
She sacrificed her hard earned
money to lift us up,

785
01:02:02,041 --> 01:02:05,666
and you just trampled it under foot

786
01:02:10,458 --> 01:02:15,458
This is the most hurtful thing you have
done to me Nosa.

787
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:19,457
You're so wrapped up in
your own self-loathing,

788
01:02:19,458 --> 01:02:22,458
that you can't see who you
are dragging down with you.

789
01:02:22,791 --> 01:02:24,583
Self-loathing
Yes

790
01:02:25,375 --> 01:02:27,958
For months, all you've been
doing is complaining...

791
01:02:28,041 --> 01:02:30,791
whining about this, that and the other!

792
01:02:31,541 --> 01:02:34,666
Nosa, I have tried my
hardest to be patient;

793
01:02:34,916 --> 01:02:36,415
to be encouraging,

794
01:02:36,416 --> 01:02:40,415
but I find myself walking around on
eggshells, when I'm with you

795
01:02:40,416 --> 01:02:44,165
In the last month, everything I
do seems to irritate you

796
01:02:44,166 --> 01:02:46,582
and you seem to find Fault in everybody

797
01:02:46,583 --> 01:02:48,083
I am sorry!

798
01:02:48,333 --> 01:02:50,790
Sorry that I can't come home and fake it!

799
01:02:50,791 --> 01:02:54,540
I am sorry that I decided to
be transparent with my wife!

800
01:02:54,541 --> 01:02:58,165
I am sorry that I'm doing my best
to handle my responsibilities,

801
01:02:58,166 --> 01:03:00,749
in spite of the crappy hand
that life is dealing me!

802
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:03,290
You make it sound like you're the
only one going through something

803
01:03:03,291 --> 01:03:05,958
Or that we haven't overcome
challenges together

804
01:03:06,291 --> 01:03:08,916
At least in the past,
you used to be hopeful

805
01:03:09,041 --> 01:03:11,875
Now it's just whining, whining, whining!

806
01:03:14,208 --> 01:03:17,125
Oh, I'm sorry, you call that transparency

807
01:03:17,333 --> 01:03:20,832
I can't believe you're
heaping insults on me

808
01:03:20,833 --> 01:03:23,583
Because of Cynthia! Cynthia!

809
01:03:23,958 --> 01:03:26,457
You're so blinded, you can't
even see her motive!

810
01:03:26,458 --> 01:03:29,165
You think she's doing this out of
the goodness of her heart?

811
01:03:29,166 --> 01:03:31,665
She never wanted us to get married!

812
01:03:31,666 --> 01:03:33,832
She never wanted to see us happen!

813
01:03:33,833 --> 01:03:37,041
This is her opportunity to just
gloat over me!

814
01:03:37,875 --> 01:03:40,625
You're still holding on to that?

815
01:03:42,166 --> 01:03:43,374
You're confusing me.

816
01:03:43,375 --> 01:03:45,416
Is this bitterness or pride?

817
01:03:47,541 --> 01:03:49,375
Or maybe it's both.

818
01:03:50,458 --> 01:03:53,333
Here you go, just proving me right

819
01:03:54,708 --> 01:03:59,082
I don't think you've ever,
ever been this disrespect.

820
01:03:59,083 --> 01:04:02,541
No! No way! You don't get to do that!

821
01:04:02,791 --> 01:04:06,958
You don't get to silence me...
I am not being disrespectful!

822
01:04:07,625 --> 01:04:10,666
It is my turn to be transparent with
you.

823
01:04:11,291 --> 01:04:15,415
In the last month, I have found
myself walking on eggshells

824
01:04:15,416 --> 01:04:17,915
to make sure that I'm not stressing you out

825
01:04:17,916 --> 01:04:21,207
to the point that I had to bottle
up the fact that I almost got raped!

826
01:04:21,208 --> 01:04:23,499
I thought I already apologized for that!

827
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:25,374
I am sorry you have to work!

828
01:04:25,375 --> 01:04:29,332
If I was rich like, what's his name, you
will never have to work a day in your life

829
01:04:29,333 --> 01:04:33,791
so I am sorry, it is my fault
that you almost got raped!

830
01:04:37,708 --> 01:04:41,375
I am traumatized

831
01:04:42,583 --> 01:04:46,375
But somehow it's all about you

832
01:04:48,916 --> 01:04:53,125
If that's not self-loathing,
I don't know what is.

833
01:04:56,208 --> 01:04:58,541
I don't want to continue having this
conversation

834
01:04:59,875 --> 01:05:01,540
The check was written out in my name

835
01:05:01,541 --> 01:05:05,540
So, if you want it that badly, let her
go and write it in your name

836
01:05:05,541 --> 01:05:10,083
and while you're there, She can pay for
your school fees and feed you too!

837
01:05:58,708 --> 01:06:02,583
I thought you said her surgery
is almost a month from now

838
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,541
I'm going earlier.

839
01:06:15,875 --> 01:06:18,833
How long after are you going to be there?

840
01:06:23,416 --> 01:06:24,958
I don't know.

841
01:06:55,666 --> 01:06:57,332
Hello, young man.

842
01:06:57,333 --> 01:06:59,083
Hello Sir.

843
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:07,208
How are you?
Good Afternoon, Sir. I'm fine, thank you

844
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:13,875
Well, let me use this opportunity to let you
know you're doing a fine job on this property

845
01:07:14,666 --> 01:07:16,333
Thank you sir.

846
01:07:18,458 --> 01:07:21,166
Mr. Edward, are you...
Are you playing by yourself?

847
01:07:21,583 --> 01:07:23,333
Oh no.

848
01:07:24,458 --> 01:07:26,833
I found this, earlier today, in the Attic.

849
01:07:27,333 --> 01:07:31,208
It used to be one of my
wife and I favorite game

850
01:07:31,916 --> 01:07:34,791
Just staring at it brings back such
pleasant memories

851
01:07:35,958 --> 01:07:37,332
Do you play this?

852
01:07:37,333 --> 01:07:40,208
Um... Yeah. Sometimes with my wife

853
01:07:40,541 --> 01:07:42,125
Wow, that's great!

854
01:07:42,666 --> 01:07:44,333
Speaking of your wife,

855
01:07:44,791 --> 01:07:46,457
I haven't seen her in a while.

856
01:07:46,458 --> 01:07:49,125
Is she on vacation?

857
01:07:49,583 --> 01:07:51,625
Something like that... Yeah

858
01:07:51,875 --> 01:07:54,416
Alone? Without you?

859
01:07:56,416 --> 01:07:59,583
Well, I suppose she won't mind me
challenging you to a game.

860
01:08:00,708 --> 01:08:02,000
Right now?

861
01:08:02,708 --> 01:08:03,958
Why not?

862
01:08:04,541 --> 01:08:06,166
Oh, unless you're scared

863
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:10,124
Scared? What, me? Ah no, no, no, no.

864
01:08:10,125 --> 01:08:14,332
Mr. Edward, just wait right there.
Let me finish taking the trash bags out

865
01:08:14,333 --> 01:08:15,500
Don't run away.

866
01:08:15,708 --> 01:08:18,833
Oh, I see we have a trash
talker on our hands.

867
01:08:19,375 --> 01:08:21,040
Well I'll be right here

868
01:08:21,041 --> 01:08:26,458
And when I'm done schooling you, you'll
know why they call me, The Professor

869
01:08:30,458 --> 01:08:33,540
Oh, Efosa, that smells so good.

870
01:08:33,541 --> 01:08:36,082
I hope it tastes half as good as it
smells

871
01:08:36,083 --> 01:08:37,375
I hope so too.

872
01:08:39,125 --> 01:08:41,708
Oh my goodness, don't you hate that?

873
01:08:42,416 --> 01:08:45,040
Oh... One day, I was visiting a
colleague of mine

874
01:08:45,041 --> 01:08:47,124
and his mother was cooking in the kitchen

875
01:08:47,125 --> 01:08:51,165
Wait. Male colleague, at home
with his mother...

876
01:08:51,166 --> 01:08:53,415
Alright, carry on.

877
01:08:53,416 --> 01:08:57,082
Oh please it's nothing like
that not even close. Okay?

878
01:08:57,083 --> 01:09:00,790
Anyways, as I was saying,
before I was rudely interrupted

879
01:09:00,791 --> 01:09:01,957
Sorry Madam

880
01:09:01,958 --> 01:09:05,332
Um-hum... As I was saying...

881
01:09:05,333 --> 01:09:09,125
The woman had me salivating
over the smell of the food

882
01:09:09,625 --> 01:09:12,333
It was so obvious, he had to offer me some

883
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:14,040
And of course,

884
01:09:14,041 --> 01:09:16,208
who was I to be rude and refuse

885
01:09:16,458 --> 01:09:18,125
So I obliged.

886
01:09:19,166 --> 01:09:20,999
Lord, who sent me. Chai!

887
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,207
That bad?

888
01:09:22,208 --> 01:09:23,290
What?!

889
01:09:23,291 --> 01:09:23,875
Let's just say,

890
01:09:23,876 --> 01:09:29,333
the smell was going north while the
taste was going south, at full speed.

891
01:09:29,958 --> 01:09:34,207
I thought I was eating something
different. It tasted so watered-down

892
01:09:34,208 --> 01:09:35,665
Oh my goodness. It was...

893
01:09:35,666 --> 01:09:38,957
It tasted as though someone came
in and poured a gallon of water inside

894
01:09:38,958 --> 01:09:40,499
Wow. That bad?

895
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:42,749
My sister, I kid you not.

896
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:47,624
Well, with the way you're dissing the woman's
food, I'm even reconsidering you trying mine.

897
01:09:47,625 --> 01:09:50,499
Oh no. It's too late now,
I must eat that today

898
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:52,220
Girl, You still haven't learnt your lesson.

899
01:10:03,625 --> 01:10:05,165
Oh my goodness.

900
01:10:05,166 --> 01:10:06,957
I can't believe it.

901
01:10:06,958 --> 01:10:09,708
You're in town? Wow!

902
01:10:09,833 --> 01:10:12,291
Oh my... Efosa, please come. Come!

903
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:14,083
Please come in.

904
01:10:17,666 --> 01:10:19,041
Wow!
How are you doing Efe?

905
01:10:21,791 --> 01:10:22,791
Hi...

906
01:10:23,166 --> 01:10:24,875
How are you?

907
01:10:25,083 --> 01:10:27,041
I'm well. Thank you. And you?

908
01:10:28,416 --> 01:10:29,416
Good. Um...

909
01:10:30,708 --> 01:10:31,958
Please excuse me for a second.

910
01:10:32,041 --> 01:10:33,374
Ah, you look so nice.

911
01:10:33,375 --> 01:10:34,166
Cynthia!

912
01:10:34,167 --> 01:10:37,291
Cynthia!
Have a seat

913
01:10:40,791 --> 01:10:42,665
Look, I promise I didn't know he was coming

914
01:10:42,666 --> 01:10:44,250
I didn't even know he was in town

915
01:10:44,541 --> 01:10:45,957
I'm just as surprised as you are

916
01:10:45,958 --> 01:10:48,583
Why don't I believe you
I swear...

917
01:10:48,916 --> 01:10:51,165
This is so embarrassing!

918
01:10:51,166 --> 01:10:54,166
Don't worry... you don't look that bad

919
01:10:54,833 --> 01:10:57,082
Besides, I thought you didn't
care what he thinks

920
01:10:57,083 --> 01:10:59,374
Cynthia I'm in no mood to be Jolly!

921
01:10:59,375 --> 01:11:00,833
Jolly?

922
01:11:01,458 --> 01:11:04,582
Sorry. Just change now and then

923
01:11:04,583 --> 01:11:06,875
maybe also put on some lip gloss.

924
01:11:07,375 --> 01:11:09,750
But, did he know that I
was staying here with you?

925
01:11:10,083 --> 01:11:12,875
Please let me get back to our guest.
We don't want to be rude.

926
01:11:13,041 --> 01:11:15,375
He's in there, waiting by himself

927
01:11:16,250 --> 01:11:18,082
So, what are you up to these days?

928
01:11:18,083 --> 01:11:21,707
Ah... nothing much. I'm just
working, keeping myself busy

929
01:11:21,708 --> 01:11:23,958
mmm
Yeah... I see your business is doing well

930
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,083
Absolutely, you know, we
just have to keep it going.

931
01:11:28,833 --> 01:11:31,000
Oh here comes the Efosa.

932
01:11:32,166 --> 01:11:36,291
That's Mrs. Efosa Edose.

933
01:11:37,291 --> 01:11:38,665
So, how have you been Efosa?

934
01:11:38,666 --> 01:11:40,875
I have been well, thank you.

935
01:11:41,250 --> 01:11:43,665
My apologies for any
inconvenience, you know.

936
01:11:43,666 --> 01:11:45,957
Popping up here without any notice.

937
01:11:45,958 --> 01:11:48,374
But you didn't have to change
because of me, you know.

938
01:11:48,375 --> 01:11:52,041
I didn't change because of you. I wanted to

939
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:55,166
Not to seem forward but,

940
01:11:55,375 --> 01:11:57,582
You look as beautiful as earlier.

941
01:11:57,583 --> 01:12:00,458
Desmond, you're such a gem

942
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:03,249
And you're such a great chef, you know.

943
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:05,790
This place smells like paradise Kitchen.

944
01:12:05,791 --> 01:12:10,833
Oh, It's not me. that was the
hard work of our chef Efosa

945
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,290
Really?

946
01:12:12,291 --> 01:12:13,499
Um-hum. Yeah.

947
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:15,458
Efosa, this smells delicious.

948
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:17,958
And I bet you the taste matches.

949
01:12:20,208 --> 01:12:21,791
Oh would you like to try some?

950
01:12:22,083 --> 01:12:25,375
My pleasure, of course, I would
absolutely love to.

951
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,708
I'm not gonna let you win this time.

952
01:12:34,250 --> 01:12:38,458
Yes, please let me win for
the fifth straight time

953
01:13:38,666 --> 01:13:43,166
Hello, Cynthia, it's Nosa.

954
01:13:45,333 --> 01:13:46,708
How are you?

955
01:13:46,875 --> 01:13:50,500
Um... I've been trying
to reach Efosa and...

956
01:13:51,333 --> 01:13:54,749
It's going to her voicemail and it's not
letting me leave a message.

957
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:57,291
So, can you call me back?

958
01:13:58,666 --> 01:14:02,625
I want to pay her a visit or something

959
01:14:03,708 --> 01:14:06,166
Anyway, call me back.

960
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:07,750
Please

961
01:14:29,708 --> 01:14:32,291
Efosa, I'm not the villain, you know.

962
01:14:33,333 --> 01:14:34,875
Why would you say that?

963
01:14:35,541 --> 01:14:37,208
Why are you ignore me?

964
01:14:39,791 --> 01:14:43,250
So you are ignoring me.
I didn't say that!

965
01:14:43,666 --> 01:14:45,375
Then you're not ignoring me?

966
01:14:45,875 --> 01:14:47,958
I didn't say that either.

967
01:14:51,416 --> 01:14:57,125
It feels good to hear your voice. I mean,
more so, that you're talking to me live

968
01:15:02,125 --> 01:15:04,499
Thank God for the privilege to, you know,

969
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:07,916
travel the world, see a lot
of beautiful things

970
01:15:08,666 --> 01:15:13,625
There are times I just want to shop and just
ship it to you.. I mean, no strings attached

971
01:15:15,666 --> 01:15:20,375
Certain times I buy female jewelry, and...

972
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:23,416
leave it in my closet

973
01:15:24,125 --> 01:15:25,166
Yeah

974
01:15:25,916 --> 01:15:28,375
Sometime, I get asked like,
hey why're you doing this?

975
01:15:28,458 --> 01:15:31,333
I'm like, um... It keeps me in touch
with my feminine side

976
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:37,958
And sometimes I say, it's for the future

977
01:15:38,875 --> 01:15:41,041
You're not saying anything

978
01:15:43,416 --> 01:15:45,208
I'm listening

979
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,166
Right.

980
01:15:48,416 --> 01:15:50,125
Do you want to see something?

981
01:15:50,333 --> 01:15:51,541
Sure

982
01:15:52,833 --> 01:15:55,415
Just brace yourself for
this though. Cause, um...

983
01:15:55,416 --> 01:15:57,374
I know you're gonna be
surprised when you see this

984
01:15:57,375 --> 01:15:59,915
Honestly and um... trust me,

985
01:15:59,916 --> 01:16:03,083
I still remember this like it
was a few minutes ago

986
01:16:05,958 --> 01:16:07,166
Yeah

987
01:16:07,666 --> 01:16:08,915
What?!

988
01:16:08,916 --> 01:16:12,207
Yeah... And I remember, on the day
we took this picture, I told my friend

989
01:16:12,208 --> 01:16:13,708
I said, you see this girl?

990
01:16:13,833 --> 01:16:15,000
I will marry her.

991
01:16:15,416 --> 01:16:17,916
Yea... But hey, look, he still
teases me to this day

992
01:16:17,958 --> 01:16:21,082
Me calls me a false prophet... Yeah
False prophet

993
01:16:21,083 --> 01:16:24,124
It's not funny!
I'm sorry but that's funny

994
01:16:24,125 --> 01:16:26,583
No, no, no, no. It's not funny
to be called a false prophet

995
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:28,666
And more so, it's your fault.

996
01:16:31,458 --> 01:16:34,458
Well it's good to know that I can
still make you laugh though.

997
01:16:35,083 --> 01:16:37,499
What're you two lovebirds chuckling over?

998
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:38,583
Cynthia!

999
01:16:39,083 --> 01:16:40,083
What?!

1000
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:43,333
Please! I'm just playing
DESMOND: Come on, Cynthia

1001
01:16:43,583 --> 01:16:45,500
Alright... I'm sorry

1002
01:16:45,833 --> 01:16:47,833
Um... Well, I am...

1003
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:50,750
I probably just, um...

1004
01:16:55,166 --> 01:16:58,041
Efosa, I'll... Okay!

1005
01:16:59,291 --> 01:17:01,166
Bye
DESMOND: Bye

1006
01:18:49,541 --> 01:18:54,416
Oh my god. Oh my god. I just...
I just want to die right now.

1007
01:18:54,833 --> 01:18:56,207
What happened?

1008
01:18:56,208 --> 01:18:57,415
Oh no...

1009
01:18:57,416 --> 01:18:59,791
My goodness, I just want to vanish

1010
01:19:01,250 --> 01:19:03,415
Cynthia, will you calm down
and tell me what happened?

1011
01:19:03,416 --> 01:19:05,874
Efosa, I am... I'm so sorry

1012
01:19:05,875 --> 01:19:09,082
I'm... I... I'm... from the
bottom of my... I'm so sorry

1013
01:19:09,083 --> 01:19:09,958
Wait!

1014
01:19:09,959 --> 01:19:11,833
What is this got to do with me?

1015
01:19:12,458 --> 01:19:13,625
Oh...

1016
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,540
I just... I just made the biggest
mistake and I am so...

1017
01:19:17,541 --> 01:19:20,832
It was the biggest boo-boo...
I swear it was a mistake

1018
01:19:20,833 --> 01:19:23,707
Would you just tell me what it is and
stop beating around the bush!

1019
01:19:23,708 --> 01:19:25,958
Okay... Okay... Okay.

1020
01:19:26,208 --> 01:19:31,332
So, I text you a picture earlier
or I thought I text you a picture

1021
01:19:31,333 --> 01:19:32,583
but...

1022
01:19:32,958 --> 01:19:36,499
Anyways, I was wondering
why you hadn't responded.

1023
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:41,082
So I went back to check my phone to see
if it went through and, it did go through

1024
01:19:41,083 --> 01:19:42,291
but I...

1025
01:19:43,208 --> 01:19:45,083
I sent it to the wrong person.

1026
01:19:46,208 --> 01:19:48,875
What did you send? And to
whom did you send it?

1027
01:19:49,250 --> 01:19:50,250
I...

1028
01:19:50,375 --> 01:19:53,875
I... sent it to Nosa.

1029
01:19:55,666 --> 01:19:58,750
What did you send to Nosa?

1030
01:20:15,583 --> 01:20:19,165
Oh my God... Oh my God...
I am so, so, so sorry

1031
01:20:19,166 --> 01:20:21,540
It's a horrible mistake I promise.

1032
01:20:21,541 --> 01:20:23,124
I don't... I don't even know what to say

1033
01:20:23,125 --> 01:20:24,125
Cynthia!

1034
01:20:24,125 --> 01:20:25,125
Mistake?!

1035
01:20:25,541 --> 01:20:28,416
A mistake?! How could you be so careless?

1036
01:20:28,875 --> 01:20:31,000
What kind of mistake is that?

1037
01:20:33,416 --> 01:20:35,457
Our names are not even close!

1038
01:20:35,458 --> 01:20:38,333
I know. It's... It's the
way I saved your names

1039
01:20:38,875 --> 01:20:40,666
How did you save?

1040
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:45,208
I saved him... as Efosa's M.

1041
01:20:46,541 --> 01:20:47,541
M?

1042
01:20:48,541 --> 01:20:49,833
Man.

1043
01:20:50,208 --> 01:20:55,124
I sent the text to Efosa's M,
instead of a Efosa.

1044
01:20:55,125 --> 01:20:58,790
Why didn't you just save his name as
Nosa?

1045
01:20:58,791 --> 01:21:01,208
Come on, you know I know a lot of Nosas

1046
01:21:03,791 --> 01:21:07,374
Where is my phone? I need to call...
No! No! No, wait! Wait, wait. Okay?

1047
01:21:07,375 --> 01:21:08,790
Don't be in such a rush.

1048
01:21:08,791 --> 01:21:10,500
It's my mistake.

1049
01:21:10,750 --> 01:21:12,082
I'll fix my mess, okay...

1050
01:21:12,083 --> 01:21:13,083
I'll handle it!
Give me my phone

1051
01:21:13,084 --> 01:21:15,416
No! Efosa, stop being so desperate!

1052
01:21:15,958 --> 01:21:20,083
I mean, come on, girl!
Has he even called yet?

1053
01:21:21,250 --> 01:21:23,666
What does that have to do with anything?

1054
01:21:24,875 --> 01:21:28,540
If it were you, you would have called.

1055
01:21:28,541 --> 01:21:31,375
Because you would have
been so damn concerned.

1056
01:21:31,708 --> 01:21:34,957
Listen, I'm trying to stay
out of your private affairs.

1057
01:21:34,958 --> 01:21:39,708
But I am so sick of seeing this man
take you for granted like this.

1058
01:21:40,833 --> 01:21:43,458
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

1059
01:21:44,250 --> 01:21:45,708
You're an enabler.

1060
01:21:46,333 --> 01:21:47,750
Good. You want to call him?

1061
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,332
Call him!

1062
01:21:49,333 --> 01:21:51,165
And then you'll be back to square one

1063
01:21:51,166 --> 01:21:53,458
Back to your old mess.

1064
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:55,665
So what am I supposed to do?
Just sit around and wait

1065
01:21:55,666 --> 01:21:57,041
Hell yeah!

1066
01:21:58,958 --> 01:22:01,583
Efosa, you are the woman

1067
01:22:02,208 --> 01:22:04,291
And a gem at that.

1068
01:22:04,916 --> 01:22:05,916
Okay?

1069
01:22:05,958 --> 01:22:09,166
He is the man. The man is
supposed to chase you

1070
01:22:10,041 --> 01:22:15,208
But, I bet you a man will not pursue a
woman that he did not see value in

1071
01:22:18,791 --> 01:22:21,291
And with your over-zealousness,

1072
01:22:21,875 --> 01:22:25,333
he'll never get the chance to
see how precious you are.

1073
01:22:26,916 --> 01:22:31,541
I mean, how many times has
he come by here to see you?

1074
01:23:35,375 --> 01:23:38,125
Chai! I can't believe it!

1075
01:23:38,583 --> 01:23:40,500
Efosa was my hero.

1076
01:23:41,333 --> 01:23:42,333
Ah ah...

1077
01:23:43,875 --> 01:23:46,458
Ha! She gave me hope in woman

1078
01:23:47,458 --> 01:23:49,916
This really hurts... Ha!

1079
01:23:53,416 --> 01:23:56,125
But why would she do something like this?

1080
01:24:03,125 --> 01:24:07,458
Wait, what do you mean, why
would she do something like this?

1081
01:24:08,291 --> 01:24:10,041
What did she do?

1082
01:24:10,666 --> 01:24:14,749
Wait a minute. Aren't you the one who
just showed me a picture on your phone,

1083
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:16,457
saying, see what your Babe did?

1084
01:24:16,458 --> 01:24:19,083
So, why are you asking me what she did?

1085
01:24:19,333 --> 01:24:20,958
Isn't this something?

1086
01:24:21,291 --> 01:24:26,666
It's like, you're confused and you're
also trying to pass it on to me.

1087
01:24:39,875 --> 01:24:41,041
Bro

1088
01:24:45,125 --> 01:24:46,750
Can I hold something?

1089
01:24:55,125 --> 01:24:56,125
Ah ah...

1090
01:24:57,333 --> 01:24:58,500
Bros, why?

1091
01:24:59,458 --> 01:25:01,083
Where are you going?

1092
01:25:58,750 --> 01:26:00,625
Mr. Edwards.

1093
01:26:02,041 --> 01:26:03,416
Good morning Nosa,

1094
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:06,291
have you been avoiding me?

1095
01:26:07,166 --> 01:26:08,291
No

1096
01:26:09,458 --> 01:26:10,916
May I come in?

1097
01:26:12,666 --> 01:26:14,958
Yeah, come in.

1098
01:26:18,125 --> 01:26:19,541
It's 4 a.m.

1099
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:21,958
4?

1100
01:26:27,333 --> 01:26:29,915
Boss, Couldn't this wait?

1101
01:26:29,916 --> 01:26:31,208
What was that?

1102
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:34,708
Sorry. I mean, can't this wait till later?

1103
01:26:35,375 --> 01:26:38,000
Well, for one, you have been avoiding me.

1104
01:26:38,458 --> 01:26:39,875
But more importantly,

1105
01:26:40,083 --> 01:26:44,000
I heard the most sound decisions
are made very early in the morning

1106
01:26:44,250 --> 01:26:46,666
between 5:00 and 6:00 a.m.

1107
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,500
It's 4:00 a.m.!

1108
01:26:48,750 --> 01:26:52,833
Well, if we started talking now,
by the time it is 5:00 a.m.

1109
01:26:53,375 --> 01:26:55,416
You'll be ready to make a sound decision

1110
01:26:58,458 --> 01:26:59,958
Ain't you gonna offer me a seat?

1111
01:27:01,333 --> 01:27:03,166
Please have a seat.

1112
01:27:03,958 --> 01:27:07,125
That's more like it. Thank you

1113
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,291
Do you want something to drink?

1114
01:27:16,458 --> 01:27:19,500
Water, juice, coffee...

1115
01:27:20,541 --> 01:27:21,583
Nyquil?

1116
01:27:23,958 --> 01:27:25,750
I see you're waking up.

1117
01:27:28,958 --> 01:27:30,541
Last time we spoke,

1118
01:27:30,875 --> 01:27:33,750
you were thanking me for advice
I didn't even know I gave

1119
01:27:35,333 --> 01:27:39,000
You were determined to go reconcile
with your wife and bring her home

1120
01:27:40,333 --> 01:27:42,290
You even got me so excited when you

1121
01:27:42,291 --> 01:27:44,833
shared your plan to
surprise her with a visit

1122
01:27:46,250 --> 01:27:47,541
come on...

1123
01:27:48,125 --> 01:27:50,458
What happened between then and now?

1124
01:27:55,833 --> 01:27:56,875
Look,

1125
01:27:57,958 --> 01:28:01,125
I've watched you two guys live
here for two years now

1126
01:28:01,541 --> 01:28:03,250
and it's been special

1127
01:28:04,125 --> 01:28:06,083
you have something beautiful

1128
01:28:06,416 --> 01:28:09,499
So beautiful and special that I'm willing
to put my reputation on the line

1129
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:11,916
coming down here so early in the morning

1130
01:28:12,708 --> 01:28:14,499
Even though, I'm sleepwalking now and

1131
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:17,833
will have no recollection of this whole
thing when I wake up later

1132
01:28:21,125 --> 01:28:22,916
so what's going on?

1133
01:29:02,958 --> 01:29:05,041
That's the man her father
wanted her to marry

1134
01:29:07,625 --> 01:29:11,500
I couldn't even meet her parents,
even though were madly in love

1135
01:29:15,333 --> 01:29:18,500
It wasn't anything personally
with them, I just...

1136
01:29:18,875 --> 01:29:20,958
I wasn't practical

1137
01:29:21,791 --> 01:29:24,958
And where we're from, love
submits to practical

1138
01:29:25,458 --> 01:29:27,415
I couldn't provide her with

1139
01:29:27,416 --> 01:29:31,833
the good things of life that she needed
without her depending on her parents

1140
01:29:32,875 --> 01:29:36,165
And then comes in, Prince Charming,

1141
01:29:36,166 --> 01:29:39,291
professing his undying love for her

1142
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:43,166
But, she was a rebel

1143
01:29:46,125 --> 01:29:48,666
She would not give in to all the pressure

1144
01:29:49,208 --> 01:29:52,457
And it wasn't just coming from
her family or her friends

1145
01:29:52,458 --> 01:29:57,166
Everyone that knew
her had an opinion of me

1146
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,791
But she was determined

1147
01:30:01,208 --> 01:30:05,125
She was going to my for
love and that was it

1148
01:30:05,791 --> 01:30:06,916
But...

1149
01:30:07,791 --> 01:30:09,250
I was poor

1150
01:30:09,750 --> 01:30:11,541
My father was poor

1151
01:30:12,333 --> 01:30:14,250
His father was poor

1152
01:30:14,458 --> 01:30:15,708
And so on.

1153
01:30:17,166 --> 01:30:20,083
I had no business falling in love with her

1154
01:30:21,458 --> 01:30:23,708
I take it, she's from a wealthy family

1155
01:30:24,125 --> 01:30:25,625
No. But...

1156
01:30:26,083 --> 01:30:29,750
She comes from a very well
respected and educated family

1157
01:30:30,958 --> 01:30:32,000
I see

1158
01:30:35,041 --> 01:30:38,458
I wanted it to work out for us so bad

1159
01:30:38,958 --> 01:30:41,833
I prayed and prayed and

1160
01:30:42,166 --> 01:30:43,875
God answered

1161
01:30:44,541 --> 01:30:46,958
If I didn't believe in God before then

1162
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:49,958
I certainly did after

1163
01:30:50,625 --> 01:30:52,583
So what happened?

1164
01:30:55,625 --> 01:30:59,291
I got a visa lottery to America...

1165
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,416
The land of opportunity

1166
01:31:02,791 --> 01:31:05,166
Suddenly everything just changed

1167
01:31:05,958 --> 01:31:07,875
I had potential

1168
01:31:08,125 --> 01:31:11,916
I mean, her parents still preferred
her to marry that other guy. But...

1169
01:31:12,666 --> 01:31:15,958
They knew she won't relent.
So, they yielded

1170
01:31:19,291 --> 01:31:21,375
So, where did you get the picture?

1171
01:31:22,750 --> 01:31:24,333
Her friend...

1172
01:31:24,708 --> 01:31:27,083
Cousin... sent it to me

1173
01:31:28,666 --> 01:31:31,666
And you think, with all you've told me,

1174
01:31:32,041 --> 01:31:34,958
she would just change her mind that
easily?

1175
01:31:35,458 --> 01:31:37,541
We've been married for four years.

1176
01:31:37,958 --> 01:31:40,166
She has seen all the cards in my hand

1177
01:31:41,250 --> 01:31:43,750
Not much of a deal.

1178
01:31:46,625 --> 01:31:48,708
Well, love, true love,

1179
01:31:49,583 --> 01:31:53,625
always hopes and believe for the best
in spite of the circumstances

1180
01:31:54,958 --> 01:31:57,458
Many people claim to marry for love

1181
01:31:57,708 --> 01:32:02,375
But, it's in marriage that they find out
what love truly requires of them.

1182
01:32:02,875 --> 01:32:04,166
And frankly,

1183
01:32:04,458 --> 01:32:07,333
That is the reason for
so many broken marriages

1184
01:32:08,875 --> 01:32:11,250
There's no love without sacrifice

1185
01:32:11,708 --> 01:32:13,458
No selfishness in love

1186
01:32:13,625 --> 01:32:15,375
That's more like lust

1187
01:32:15,916 --> 01:32:18,833
And once many find out what
love demands of them,

1188
01:32:19,833 --> 01:32:21,791
they want out.

1189
01:32:22,458 --> 01:32:26,041
One of the most attractive
attributes of love is humility

1190
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,958
Many men count it as weakness,

1191
01:32:29,708 --> 01:32:30,791
But the fact,

1192
01:32:31,250 --> 01:32:36,541
Not a lot of us possess the strength of
character it requires to bend our knee

1193
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,583
Especially, when we feel
justified in our stand

1194
01:32:42,125 --> 01:32:43,583
Hear me on this,

1195
01:32:44,041 --> 01:32:48,791
You have something very special,
very rare, very precious!

1196
01:32:49,625 --> 01:32:52,166
Preserve it. Fight for it!

1197
01:32:52,708 --> 01:32:54,625
Don't let pride rob you of it.

1198
01:32:55,625 --> 01:32:58,666
I know it's easy to expect her to come
running back into your arms

1199
01:32:59,666 --> 01:33:00,833
But sometimes

1200
01:33:01,166 --> 01:33:04,291
You have to remind her why she
should come running back

1201
01:33:05,041 --> 01:33:06,166
It's not easy.

1202
01:33:07,375 --> 01:33:10,083
It all seems to straight
and narrow at times

1203
01:33:11,541 --> 01:33:13,000
But, it's the way

1204
01:33:32,583 --> 01:33:34,499
Oh my goodness... Ah..

1205
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:36,125
What time is it?

1206
01:33:37,083 --> 01:33:38,541
6:37

1207
01:33:39,250 --> 01:33:40,583
No, no, no...

1208
01:33:40,708 --> 01:33:43,915
The dry cleaner closes at 7:00. I have
to get that dress for tomorrow

1209
01:33:43,916 --> 01:33:45,582
Why don't you just go and
get it in the morning?

1210
01:33:45,583 --> 01:33:47,041
The event is until the evening.

1211
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:49,625
They're closed on Sundays

1212
01:33:51,916 --> 01:33:54,124
Oh! Desmond, come on in... Come on in
Hi

1213
01:33:54,125 --> 01:33:55,707
Listen, I'll be right back

1214
01:33:55,708 --> 01:33:57,226
I have to go to the dry cleaners, okay...

1215
01:33:57,250 --> 01:33:58,875
I'll see you in a second

1216
01:34:03,458 --> 01:34:04,874
How are you doing Efosa?

1217
01:34:04,875 --> 01:34:06,041
I'm okay.

1218
01:34:08,625 --> 01:34:09,625
Ummm...

1219
01:34:09,708 --> 01:34:11,208
I got you a little something

1220
01:34:14,125 --> 01:34:15,458
What is it?

1221
01:34:15,958 --> 01:34:17,958
Well, there's only one way to find out

1222
01:34:28,208 --> 01:34:30,000
It's beautiful.

1223
01:34:30,875 --> 01:34:33,791
Why don't you try it on?

1224
01:34:34,250 --> 01:34:35,957
Desmond, you know I can't do that.

1225
01:34:35,958 --> 01:34:37,165
What's wrong is he broken?

1226
01:34:37,166 --> 01:34:39,291
Desmond I'm being serious!

1227
01:34:41,708 --> 01:34:42,708
Why?

1228
01:34:43,166 --> 01:34:44,374
Why do you want to complicate things?

1229
01:34:44,375 --> 01:34:45,541
I mean,

1230
01:34:45,958 --> 01:34:46,999
there're no strings attached.

1231
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,457
I mean, I specifically made sure the...

1232
01:34:49,458 --> 01:34:51,166
The price tag was taken off. It's...

1233
01:34:51,583 --> 01:34:53,125
It's nothing... It's just a gift.

1234
01:34:57,208 --> 01:34:58,833
Where do you see this going?

1235
01:35:04,625 --> 01:35:06,500
Wherever love leads, Efosa

1236
01:35:08,083 --> 01:35:09,083
Look

1237
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,625
I've never gotten over you.

1238
01:35:16,375 --> 01:35:17,375
I...

1239
01:35:17,583 --> 01:35:19,875
I don't, I don't think I can

1240
01:35:20,583 --> 01:35:22,833
My love for you will never die

1241
01:35:26,541 --> 01:35:28,083
Maybe it's...

1242
01:35:29,333 --> 01:35:30,624
Maybe it's just a crush

1243
01:35:30,625 --> 01:35:31,625
No!

1244
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,291
It's more than that.

1245
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:36,125
This is true love

1246
01:35:37,416 --> 01:35:38,416
Look,

1247
01:35:39,750 --> 01:35:41,458
I've been blessed with a lot

1248
01:35:42,416 --> 01:35:45,458
Whatever money can buy, I can afford it

1249
01:35:46,208 --> 01:35:48,540
But, all of these things don't matter

1250
01:35:48,541 --> 01:35:51,291
If they're not shared with
that special someone

1251
01:35:52,375 --> 01:35:53,541
Efosa,

1252
01:35:54,125 --> 01:35:55,333
no woman,

1253
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,250
none has been...

1254
01:35:57,541 --> 01:36:01,500
None has been able to come close
to taking your place in my heart

1255
01:36:04,416 --> 01:36:06,041
I love you.

1256
01:36:22,958 --> 01:36:24,666
Efosa, is everything okay?

1257
01:36:25,958 --> 01:36:27,791

EFOSA: How much is he paying you?

1283
01:39:09,958 --> 01:39:10,958
What?

1284
01:39:11,708 --> 01:39:15,041
How much is Desmond paying you?

1285
01:39:17,166 --> 01:39:19,375
What are you talking... Paying me for what?

1286
01:39:21,208 --> 01:39:24,291
To wreck my home

1287
01:39:26,458 --> 01:39:30,208
First of all, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1288
01:39:32,083 --> 01:39:33,957
Secondly, I think you need to calm down

1289
01:39:33,958 --> 01:39:36,125
before you say something
that you're gonna regret

1290
01:39:37,041 --> 01:39:38,958
You're going a little too far

1291
01:39:39,333 --> 01:39:40,458
Oh really?

1292
01:39:40,791 --> 01:39:42,375
Yes!

1293
01:39:59,750 --> 01:40:01,541
That is what you make out of this?

1294
01:40:02,458 --> 01:40:04,291
It's rather obvious!

1295
01:40:04,375 --> 01:40:06,208
Oh please Efosa,

1296
01:40:06,916 --> 01:40:08,291
don't be ridiculous

1297
01:40:08,875 --> 01:40:11,666
Oh am I?
Yes! Very much!

1298
01:40:12,458 --> 01:40:13,125
I...

1299
01:40:13,208 --> 01:40:16,416
I can't believe that that would even
cross your mind... Obviously,

1300
01:40:16,875 --> 01:40:19,250
You don't know me as well
as you think you do

1301
01:40:19,833 --> 01:40:22,458
and certainly don't know Desmond at all.

1302
01:40:23,625 --> 01:40:26,250
Let me tell you something
about Desmond that you...

1303
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,625
Either don't know

1304
01:40:28,833 --> 01:40:30,750
or refuse to understand.

1305
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:34,291
Desmond is a great guy!

1306
01:40:35,083 --> 01:40:36,250
A great guy!

1307
01:40:36,916 --> 01:40:40,833
The most generous person I know, and
that's an understatement.

1308
01:40:42,708 --> 01:40:45,000
You stumbling over this?

1309
01:40:45,500 --> 01:40:46,750
Please!

1310
01:40:47,625 --> 01:40:50,250
That's just chicken change
for people like Desmond

1311
01:40:50,708 --> 01:40:52,541
At least, he chooses to help people

1312
01:40:54,958 --> 01:40:56,791
Forgive me for my naivete

1313
01:40:56,958 --> 01:41:00,957
But $8,000 seems a lot more
like a paycheck, than charity!

1314
01:41:00,958 --> 01:41:04,625
That is because your husband is poor!

1315
01:41:05,083 --> 01:41:08,832
It probably takes him two months
of hard work, plus overtime,

1316
01:41:08,833 --> 01:41:10,499
just to see something like this.

1317
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:11,541
But...

1318
01:41:12,041 --> 01:41:13,041
This...

1319
01:41:13,666 --> 01:41:16,000
This is a dinner dress.

1320
01:41:16,375 --> 01:41:17,750
A birthday gift.

1321
01:41:18,250 --> 01:41:21,083
A wristwatch... to people like Desmond!

1322
01:41:21,541 --> 01:41:23,375
And he chooses to help people

1323
01:41:24,916 --> 01:41:26,957
I didn't know you were in need of charity

1324
01:41:26,958 --> 01:41:27,958
Of course...

1325
01:41:28,958 --> 01:41:31,749
and you will never know
because even if I needed money

1326
01:41:31,750 --> 01:41:34,541
I would never come running to you.

1327
01:41:42,958 --> 01:41:45,541
So that's what you think of me?

1328
01:41:47,666 --> 01:41:51,874
Every time I have confided in
you with my financial struggles,

1329
01:41:51,875 --> 01:41:54,500
you think I'm asking you for money?!

1330
01:41:58,666 --> 01:42:00,791
Nosa was right about you.

1331
01:42:03,250 --> 01:42:06,583
Thank God we didn't take your money!

1332
01:42:07,041 --> 01:42:09,999
Well, that still doesn't change
the fact that he is still broke,

1333
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,916
and still putting you through
suffer-head in America

1334
01:42:13,958 --> 01:42:16,916
By the way, where did you
think that $5,000 came from?

1335
01:42:24,166 --> 01:42:25,458
Cynthia,

1336
01:42:26,041 --> 01:42:28,500
not everything in life is about money

1337
01:42:29,791 --> 01:42:32,500
There are more important things.

1338
01:42:32,750 --> 01:42:34,666
Things like love

1339
01:42:34,916 --> 01:42:36,916
Like your character

1340
01:42:37,708 --> 01:42:39,625
Like your soul.

1341
01:42:40,916 --> 01:42:43,165
Something you've clearly sold

1342
01:42:43,166 --> 01:42:47,333
to become a homewrecker in
exchange for his generosity

1343
01:42:51,125 --> 01:42:52,125
Wow...

1344
01:42:54,458 --> 01:42:56,375
That was low, Efosa.

1345
01:42:58,416 --> 01:42:59,625
That hurt.

1346
01:43:04,666 --> 01:43:06,541
The truth hurts

1347
01:43:36,541 --> 01:43:39,249
That's a nice one. One more...

1348
01:43:39,250 --> 01:43:40,915
Change position... More, more.

1349
01:43:40,916 --> 01:43:43,458
Move in closer... That's it! Yes! Yes!

1350
01:43:43,875 --> 01:43:45,790
That is good! That is good!

1351
01:43:45,791 --> 01:43:47,957
Ah, that's nice. That is so nice.

1352
01:43:47,958 --> 01:43:50,208
Wow... Wow...

1353
01:43:53,625 --> 01:43:55,332
Ah, more, more, more, wait.

1354
01:43:55,333 --> 01:43:59,125
One more, one more, one more!
