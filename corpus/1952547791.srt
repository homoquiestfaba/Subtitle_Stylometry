1
00:01:03,847 --> 00:01:07,806
As soon as you feed, Senator,
you won't need these anymore.

2
00:01:19,395 --> 00:01:20,726
Holy shit!

3
00:01:22,398 --> 00:01:24,195
It's the attack of Grandpa Munster!

4
00:01:30,707 --> 00:01:32,106
Gross.

5
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,567
Damn it.

6
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:38,306
Sorry to ruin your party, Senator.

7
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:41,206
Don't worry,
we'll have you out of here in two minutes.

8
00:01:41,384 --> 00:01:43,409
- Thank you.
- Edgar! Aah!

9
00:01:43,887 --> 00:01:45,616
Alan? Alan!

10
00:01:49,292 --> 00:01:51,089
Alan!

11
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,858
Alan.

12
00:02:00,303 --> 00:02:02,965
Alan. Alan, are you okay?

13
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,309
No. No, Alan, no. No, Alan!

14
00:02:08,478 --> 00:02:09,502
Alan!

15
00:02:13,283 --> 00:02:15,444
I am a vampire.

16
00:02:15,618 --> 00:02:19,577
Oh, yeah?
Well, abracadabra. I'm an umpire.

17
00:02:20,156 --> 00:02:22,090
Hocus pocus.

18
00:02:27,797 --> 00:02:29,958
Mr. Frog?

19
00:02:31,267 --> 00:02:32,291
Yeah?

20
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:34,066
Were you sleeping?

21
00:02:35,171 --> 00:02:36,468
I work nights.

22
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:39,574
- Apparently not hard enough.
- Hmm.

23
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,334
You're in default on your loans...

24
00:02:41,511 --> 00:02:43,979
...and the bank is repossessing
this property.

25
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,109
This would include any...

26
00:02:46,282 --> 00:02:48,113
...structure currently
on the property as well.

27
00:02:49,485 --> 00:02:52,249
- Are you serious?
- You have one week to vacate.

28
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:56,782
Have a good day.

29
00:02:58,828 --> 00:03:00,989
Fucking vampires.

30
00:05:26,109 --> 00:05:28,407
Cash or store credit?
Cash.

31
00:05:30,947 --> 00:05:33,472
Comes to 65 even.

32
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:35,082
Sixty-five dollars?

33
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:38,982
Are you kidding me? I mean, this issue
of Destroy All Vampires number 125...

34
00:05:39,155 --> 00:05:41,953
...in nearly mint condition
is worth 50 bucks alone.

35
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,922
In near-mint condition.

36
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,262
I know near-mint condition
and that ain't it.

37
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:51,662
What are you talking about?
I haven't even opened this book.

38
00:05:51,834 --> 00:05:54,701
It's been boarded and bagged
since the day I got it.

39
00:05:54,871 --> 00:05:56,031
Well, let's have a look.

40
00:05:57,707 --> 00:06:00,608
There are stress marks
at the staple points.

41
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:04,474
The, uh, cover has lost at least 15 percent
of its gloss...

42
00:06:04,647 --> 00:06:06,171
...the pages are yellow...

43
00:06:06,349 --> 00:06:08,749
...and there's significant
rubbing and fading at the corners.

44
00:06:08,918 --> 00:06:09,942
Hmm.

45
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:13,680
Now, if you were willing to part
with that Batman number 14...

46
00:06:13,856 --> 00:06:16,381
...I, uh, might be able
to do a little bit better.

47
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:17,753
That's not gonna happen.

48
00:06:17,927 --> 00:06:20,725
Happens to have
some sentimental value to it.

49
00:06:20,897 --> 00:06:22,159
That's my offer, Frog.

50
00:06:22,331 --> 00:06:24,060
Take it or leave it.

51
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,334
All right, pay me.

52
00:06:31,007 --> 00:06:32,065
Have a nice day.

53
00:06:33,676 --> 00:06:34,904
I hate happy people.

54
00:06:36,946 --> 00:06:39,005
- Hmm.
- Hey, Edgar.

55
00:06:39,182 --> 00:06:41,013
Did you make any money off of Frank?

56
00:06:41,451 --> 00:06:44,852
Are you kidding?
He gave me 65 bucks for everything.

57
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:47,285
Ugh. He's such a cheapskate.

58
00:06:47,457 --> 00:06:48,583
Here, let me see.

59
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,384
Uh, not that one.

60
00:06:54,464 --> 00:06:56,591
But there's still some good stuff in here.

61
00:06:57,266 --> 00:06:59,757
You want me to put it up on eBay,
see what I can get?

62
00:07:00,303 --> 00:07:03,704
Uh, sure, why not.

63
00:07:03,873 --> 00:07:06,137
Every little bit helps right now.

64
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:08,277
Where do I find the graphic novels?

65
00:07:08,444 --> 00:07:09,775
You mean comic books.

66
00:07:09,946 --> 00:07:13,109
No, I mean graphic novels.

67
00:07:13,282 --> 00:07:15,512
I don't read comic books. I'm not a geek.

68
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,347
Hmm.
- Oh, well, I can't help you then.

69
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,887
Here at the Book O'Neer, geek is chic.

70
00:07:21,057 --> 00:07:23,423
- Try Barnes & Noble.
Whatever.

71
00:07:23,593 --> 00:07:26,118
I guess you don't want me
to spend any money here.

72
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:32,563
That guy gets on my last nerve.

73
00:07:32,735 --> 00:07:34,965
- You know him?
- By reputation only.

74
00:07:35,404 --> 00:07:37,304
His name is Jonny Trash.

75
00:07:37,473 --> 00:07:39,134
He's a celebrity blogger.

76
00:07:39,308 --> 00:07:41,538
What the hell is he doing here
in San Cazador?

77
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,805
- They're here for the X-Party.
- The X-Party?

78
00:07:44,981 --> 00:07:47,040
- What's that?
- A rave.

79
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,444
And it's gonna be here?

80
00:07:48,618 --> 00:07:50,051
If you believe the rumors.

81
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:54,087
But they're not telling anyone where
it's gonna be until the night of the event.

82
00:07:54,257 --> 00:07:55,485
Great.

83
00:07:55,658 --> 00:07:59,116
Sounds like the final nail in my coffin.

84
00:08:02,298 --> 00:08:03,322
What...?

85
00:08:06,802 --> 00:08:07,962
Bye.

86
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:21,077
Oh, shit!

87
00:08:27,523 --> 00:08:28,683
Who the hell parked...?

88
00:08:28,858 --> 00:08:29,882
My truck.

89
00:08:30,059 --> 00:08:34,519
You sure don't look like a cold-blooded,
meaner-than-hell, badass vampire killer.

90
00:08:34,697 --> 00:08:36,358
Excuse me?

91
00:08:36,532 --> 00:08:38,329
You're Edgar Frog.

92
00:08:38,501 --> 00:08:42,437
Sworn enemy to nightcrawlers
and bloodsuckers the world over.

93
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,329
I'm sorry, lady.

94
00:08:45,508 --> 00:08:47,942
You must have me confused
with somebody else.

95
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,668
I'm Gwen. Gwen Lieber.

96
00:08:53,316 --> 00:08:56,649
- Hi.
- And there is no confusion.

97
00:08:56,819 --> 00:08:59,219
You are the same Edgar Frog
that destroyed covens...

98
00:08:59,388 --> 00:09:03,586
...in Santa Carla, Luna Bay
and in Washington, D.C.

99
00:09:07,096 --> 00:09:09,223
I have no idea what you're talking about.

100
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,135
Can we go inside to talk?

101
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:18,332
You got two minutes.

102
00:09:21,177 --> 00:09:23,737
It's my brother, Peter.

103
00:09:23,913 --> 00:09:25,847
He's been kidnapped.

104
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,608
A couple of years ago,
he started getting into trouble.

105
00:09:29,785 --> 00:09:31,980
He was hanging out
with all the wrong kind of people.

106
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,246
Hmm.

107
00:09:33,422 --> 00:09:39,224
And three weeks ago,
he went to Ibiza to this rave party thing...

108
00:09:39,428 --> 00:09:40,827
...and he disappeared.

109
00:09:55,444 --> 00:09:59,574
He started following around
this guy, DJ X.

110
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,916
He throws these events called X-Parties.

111
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,284
Yeah, I've heard of him.

112
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,019
Hi.

113
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:18,557
The same people
that are throwing this party...

114
00:10:18,734 --> 00:10:21,635
...are throwing similar parties
all over the world.

115
00:10:21,804 --> 00:10:26,434
And at these raves,
they're handing out this new designer drug.

116
00:10:26,609 --> 00:10:30,101
It's called the Thirst.

117
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:33,510
- It comes in little ampoules like this one.
Why would I care about...

118
00:10:33,683 --> 00:10:36,481
...a bunch of drug addicts
with glow sticks?

119
00:10:36,652 --> 00:10:38,552
Because the Thirst is not a drug.

120
00:10:43,626 --> 00:10:45,958
It's vampire blood.

121
00:11:19,729 --> 00:11:21,526
Nobody has seen him since.

122
00:11:22,498 --> 00:11:26,491
Edgar, they are using these raves
to breed an army of vampires.

123
00:11:26,669 --> 00:11:29,069
They're creating
their own global pandemic.

124
00:11:29,238 --> 00:11:31,866
They've already infected hundreds
in Spain.

125
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:35,499
Done the same in Thailand, Rio
and in Greece.

126
00:11:35,678 --> 00:11:38,203
And now the rumors say
that they're on their way here.

127
00:11:42,318 --> 00:11:43,717
I'm not interested.

128
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:46,880
Look, I would obviously pay you
for your trouble.

129
00:11:47,056 --> 00:11:51,117
And this could well be the last time that
you would have to do something like this.

130
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,022
All of my research suggests...

131
00:11:53,195 --> 00:11:57,655
...that the Thirst is made from the blood
of the head vampire.

132
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:00,631
- The head vampire.
- The bloodsucking alpha.

133
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,532
- The alpha.
- From the Greek, "root"...

134
00:12:02,705 --> 00:12:03,797
...meaning the first.

135
00:12:05,775 --> 00:12:06,969
The original.

136
00:12:07,543 --> 00:12:08,567
I knew that.

137
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,549
I'm still not interested.

138
00:12:18,354 --> 00:12:20,447
And your two minutes are up.

139
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,624
I'm staying at the Hotel Cazador.

140
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:31,594
I truly hope that you'll reconsider.

141
00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:36,765
I know you couldn't save your brother...

142
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:40,302
...but, Edgar,
maybe you can help me save mine.

143
00:12:46,982 --> 00:12:48,574
Hmph.

144
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:05,390
Go and check on our guest, would you?

145
00:13:17,179 --> 00:13:20,637
Hi, handsome.
How are you feeling?

146
00:13:20,816 --> 00:13:24,582
Hmm. Poor little thing.

147
00:13:24,787 --> 00:13:26,652
Just try to relax.

148
00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:29,057
This will all be over soon.

149
00:13:40,436 --> 00:13:45,271
Why would anyone
jump out of a perfectly good airplane?

150
00:13:45,441 --> 00:13:47,602
Because it's so fucking fun!

151
00:13:55,784 --> 00:13:58,810
You make sure our package arrives
in one piece.

152
00:13:58,988 --> 00:14:00,853
And send someone to take care of Frog.

153
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,204
DJ X...

154
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,508
...the man behind the machine. I've been
whoring the fuck out of your next party...

155
00:14:55,678 --> 00:14:58,044
...on my website,
and you can't even text me back?

156
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,744
You know how many media impressions
that is a day?

157
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,476
Don't put your hands on me, man.
I don't even know you.

158
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:07,088
That's our head of security, Kirk O'Dale.

159
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:08,914
There...

160
00:15:09,358 --> 00:15:10,382
...now you know him.

161
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:16,696
Well, just wait a minute.
If you don't give an interview right now...

162
00:15:16,865 --> 00:15:19,561
...then I swear I'll make it
my personal mission in life...

163
00:15:19,735 --> 00:15:24,729
...to make sure that no one goes
to any more of your stupid parties ever.

164
00:15:24,907 --> 00:15:26,568
Well, we wouldn't want that.

165
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,039
After all...

166
00:15:30,212 --> 00:15:33,545
...ever is a long time.

167
00:15:33,716 --> 00:15:35,343
Step into my office.

168
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,784
I've got the blues

169
00:16:11,854 --> 00:16:14,379
I've got the blues

170
00:16:15,858 --> 00:16:19,259
I ain't got nothing but the blues

171
00:16:19,428 --> 00:16:22,454
I ain't got nothing but the blues

172
00:16:22,631 --> 00:16:24,428
Why did you go?

173
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,591
Ugh. Creepy.

174
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:28,236
Why did you go

175
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:33,475
And leave me here with the blues?

176
00:16:33,642 --> 00:16:36,941
And leave me here with the blues?

177
00:16:37,112 --> 00:16:40,513
You left me sad and you left me sore

178
00:16:40,683 --> 00:16:43,311
You left me with the lowdown blues

179
00:16:44,987 --> 00:16:46,818
Hello, Edgar.

180
00:16:46,989 --> 00:16:48,854
What brings you all the way down here?

181
00:16:49,024 --> 00:16:51,618
Now I have to have an excuse
to visit my own brother?

182
00:16:51,794 --> 00:16:53,989
At 1 in the morning, yeah.

183
00:16:54,163 --> 00:16:56,154
I figured you'd be up.

184
00:16:56,331 --> 00:16:59,391
I've recently learned
there's a nightcrawler...

185
00:16:59,568 --> 00:17:03,231
...who's created a new designer drug
that he's handing out to kids at raves.

186
00:17:03,405 --> 00:17:06,067
The only problem is it's not a drug...

187
00:17:06,241 --> 00:17:07,367
...it's vampire blood.

188
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,704
He's breeding an undead army...

189
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,145
...and the only thing that stands
between him...

190
00:17:15,551 --> 00:17:17,746
...and the annihilation...

191
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,480
...of the entire human race...

192
00:17:20,656 --> 00:17:22,487
...potentially...

193
00:17:22,758 --> 00:17:23,782
...would be us.

194
00:17:25,027 --> 00:17:27,120
The Frog Brothers.

195
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:32,466
We haven't been the Frog Brothers
for a long time.

196
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,625
I just...

197
00:17:35,204 --> 00:17:37,900
- I can't do it without you.
- What about Sam?

198
00:17:38,073 --> 00:17:39,563
Sam's gone.

199
00:17:39,742 --> 00:17:43,007
He turned,
and, uh, I had to do what I had to do.

200
00:17:44,613 --> 00:17:46,740
I guess that cancels out
Michael and Star.

201
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:53,046
Yeah. I'm pretty much persona non grata
with the entire Emerson family at this point.

202
00:17:53,222 --> 00:17:55,349
- Laddie?
- He's moved on.

203
00:17:55,524 --> 00:17:58,925
He's got a wife, kids.

204
00:18:00,028 --> 00:18:01,188
He's got a real life now.

205
00:18:01,363 --> 00:18:03,558
- Yeah, well, so do I.
- You call this a life?

206
00:18:03,732 --> 00:18:07,168
- This from a guy who lives in a trailer.
- Okay, so I've got nothing.

207
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,702
But at least I know what side I'm on!

208
00:18:10,639 --> 00:18:14,769
Alan, if this is the head vampire,
then maybe we can kill him.

209
00:18:14,943 --> 00:18:17,707
If we kill him,
then we just gotta find the one above him...

210
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:23,284
...and then on and on like that forever.
- They are telling me that this is the alpha.

211
00:18:23,452 --> 00:18:27,548
The O.G. Of all bloodsuckers,
the head vampire.

212
00:18:27,723 --> 00:18:30,385
It's a pyramid scheme, Edgar.

213
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,685
Always has been.

214
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:35,830
What if this is it though?

215
00:18:35,998 --> 00:18:38,125
What if this really is the head vampire?

216
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,790
Get this...

217
00:18:39,968 --> 00:18:42,266
...and get it good, Edgar.

218
00:18:43,272 --> 00:18:44,796
As far as I'm concerned...

219
00:18:46,441 --> 00:18:49,877
...there's no such thing as vampires.

220
00:18:50,913 --> 00:18:55,043
Hola, Trashynistas.
I'm sitting here with the one, the only...

221
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,048
...DJ X.

222
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,881
I'm sorry for those of you
who have a shitty connection.

223
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:03,513
I guess you'll just have to take my word
for when I tell you...

224
00:19:03,692 --> 00:19:07,628
...the man's absolutely scrumptious.

225
00:19:07,796 --> 00:19:10,264
They'll just have to
come and see me in person.

226
00:19:10,432 --> 00:19:13,060
Yeah, well,
they'll just have to get in line. Ha, ha.

227
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:17,236
So, DJ X,
why do you think the detached and the...

228
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:21,103
...you know, the disconnected youth
of today have latched on so fervently...

229
00:19:21,276 --> 00:19:22,573
...to your parties?

230
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,143
Because I create a place...

231
00:19:24,313 --> 00:19:28,079
...where all the lost souls of the world
can come together.

232
00:19:28,517 --> 00:19:30,951
A place where they can do
what they want...

233
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:33,747
...whenever they wanna do it.

234
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,588
Yeah,
you heard it straight from the man himself...

235
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:40,717
...all you lost boys and girls. This is
gonna be the biggest rave of the century.

236
00:19:40,896 --> 00:19:44,161
And we'll let you know where
it's gonna be an hour before this event...

237
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:48,394
...so stay tuned to this website
for the deets.

238
00:19:49,338 --> 00:19:51,033
That was a great interview, X.

239
00:19:51,206 --> 00:19:52,503
Thank you so much.

240
00:19:53,575 --> 00:19:55,042
No, no, thank you...

241
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:56,905
...for getting the word out.

242
00:19:57,079 --> 00:20:02,016
I wanna have as many people at this event
as possible.

243
00:20:02,184 --> 00:20:03,674
It's my pleasure.

244
00:20:04,887 --> 00:20:06,479
And I mean that.

245
00:20:08,156 --> 00:20:11,819
So anyhow, what do you guys
have to drink in this jalopy?

246
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:14,819
You.

247
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,864
Death to all vampires.

248
00:20:27,042 --> 00:20:28,669
Maximum body count.

249
00:20:28,844 --> 00:20:30,402
We're awesome monster bashers.

250
00:20:30,579 --> 00:20:33,514
- The meanest.
- The baddest.

251
00:20:55,971 --> 00:20:56,995
Edgar.

252
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,766
If I'm gonna do this,
I'm gonna need weapons.

253
00:21:00,309 --> 00:21:02,038
Lots of weapons.

254
00:21:02,477 --> 00:21:07,176
Lots of really expensive,
custom-made weapons.

255
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,839
Well, of course. Come in.

256
00:21:09,651 --> 00:21:10,879
Hmm.

257
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,087
Please have a seat.

258
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:22,756
So aren't you the least bit curious
on how I know so much about vampires?

259
00:21:22,931 --> 00:21:23,955
Not really.

260
00:21:24,132 --> 00:21:25,360
I know who you are.

261
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:30,062
You're Gwen Lieber. Bestselling author
of the Eternity Kiss series.

262
00:21:30,238 --> 00:21:33,730
First of which is about to be made
into a major motion picture...

263
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:35,934
...coming soon to a theater near you.

264
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:39,879
Oh, you've heard of me. I'm flattered.

265
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:42,608
Don't be. Your books suck.

266
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:45,877
I'm sorry you feel that way.

267
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,783
Doesn't really matter what I think.

268
00:21:47,956 --> 00:21:50,925
You've got millions of emo-goth sheep
all over the world...

269
00:21:51,093 --> 00:21:54,824
...who eat up every last word of it,
and keep coming back for more.

270
00:21:54,997 --> 00:21:59,457
I'm sure you've made quite a nice living
off your supernatural bodice-rippers.

271
00:21:59,634 --> 00:22:04,230
I'll have you know, I have gotten glowing
reviews from every major periodical.

272
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:07,102
Bought and paid for, I'm sure.

273
00:22:07,275 --> 00:22:08,333
Just like me.

274
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,273
What is your problem, Frog?

275
00:22:10,445 --> 00:22:11,571
My problem?

276
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,739
My problem is you glorify vampirism.

277
00:22:15,684 --> 00:22:18,619
You make being a vampire look...

278
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,148
...sexy.

279
00:22:21,656 --> 00:22:23,021
Well...

280
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:27,652
...there has always been an element
of eroticism in vampire mythology.

281
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:32,123
There is nothing sexy
about being a member of the undead.

282
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:36,632
Well, perhaps I have made a serious mistake
in coming to you.

283
00:22:36,805 --> 00:22:40,969
If you came to me expecting me to ask
for your autograph, then yes, you did.

284
00:22:41,143 --> 00:22:45,807
But if you came to me
expecting me to kill a shitload of vampires...

285
00:22:46,048 --> 00:22:47,777
...that I can do.

286
00:23:03,065 --> 00:23:04,191
Don't like the stake...

287
00:23:04,366 --> 00:23:06,994
...maybe it needs a little garlic?

288
00:23:10,172 --> 00:23:12,037
Here we go.

289
00:23:12,841 --> 00:23:16,004
Freshly served.

290
00:23:17,446 --> 00:23:18,470
Shit.

291
00:23:32,527 --> 00:23:33,653
Eat that.

292
00:23:39,901 --> 00:23:42,836
- Frog.
GWEN Edgar, it's Gwen.

293
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:45,063
Can you come by my hotel right away?

294
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,605
It's rather important.

295
00:23:46,775 --> 00:23:49,767
All right. I'll be right there.

296
00:24:06,161 --> 00:24:07,423
Hello, Edgar.

297
00:24:07,596 --> 00:24:10,656
So, what's so important you need me
to come down here right away?

298
00:24:10,832 --> 00:24:13,494
Well, I thought you should meet
your new partner.

299
00:24:13,668 --> 00:24:18,037
When you turned me down,
I was desperate, so I hired someone else...

300
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:22,336
...and I'd really feel bad making him come
all the way from Hollywood for nothing.

301
00:24:22,511 --> 00:24:23,535
Hollywood?

302
00:24:24,246 --> 00:24:27,443
I don't like the sound of it. Who is this?

303
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,719
Lars Von Goetz?

304
00:24:42,831 --> 00:24:43,991
Lars, this is...

305
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:45,633
Oh, yeah. The Toad.

306
00:24:46,968 --> 00:24:48,526
Frog.

307
00:24:48,703 --> 00:24:50,796
- Edgar Frog.
- That's what I said.

308
00:24:51,606 --> 00:24:52,834
Yeah.

309
00:24:53,008 --> 00:24:54,270
I'm Lars Von Goetz.

310
00:24:54,442 --> 00:24:55,932
But you already knew that.

311
00:24:56,511 --> 00:24:59,480
And this is Claus, my camera operator.

312
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:02,981
So let's go kick the shit
out of some little rave punks, huh?

313
00:25:03,151 --> 00:25:04,880
But first, I gotta eat.

314
00:25:05,053 --> 00:25:07,578
I got the metabolism
of a 12-year-old boy.

315
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,519
Can I speak with you for a minute?

316
00:25:10,292 --> 00:25:11,782
Right.

317
00:25:13,161 --> 00:25:15,686
Never fear, Lars Von Goetz is here.

318
00:25:16,331 --> 00:25:18,697
As long as the check clears.

319
00:25:19,134 --> 00:25:20,499
Lars Von Goetz?

320
00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:23,263
You hired Lars Von Goetz?

321
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:26,007
- I thought you'd be happy.
- Happy?

322
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:28,636
First you expect me
to kill a head vampire...

323
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:31,745
...then you expect me
to babysit some reality show reject?

324
00:25:31,913 --> 00:25:34,006
You're not going to have to babysit him.

325
00:25:34,182 --> 00:25:35,945
Haven't you seen his show?

326
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:40,417
The man's wrestled a grizzly bear,
a lion and an alligator.

327
00:25:40,589 --> 00:25:41,817
He's amazing.

328
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:43,321
That was staged.

329
00:25:43,491 --> 00:25:46,949
All reality shows are staged, okay?

330
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:50,154
Von Goetz, whatever his name is,
he's a fraud.

331
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:54,467
Vampires are, like,
10 times stronger than grizzly bears.

332
00:25:54,903 --> 00:25:59,237
- Well, I think he can take care of himself.
- We'll see about that.

333
00:25:59,407 --> 00:26:00,999
That creepy guy's looking at me.

334
00:26:01,176 --> 00:26:02,871
Oh, gross.
Here's the deal.

335
00:26:03,044 --> 00:26:05,035
If I'm gonna do this,
I'm gonna need weapons.

336
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,842
Right. You said that.

337
00:26:07,015 --> 00:26:08,744
I'll go see my guy tomorrow.

338
00:26:08,917 --> 00:26:11,249
- You don't want me to come with you?
- No.

339
00:26:12,387 --> 00:26:15,515
He's a little twitchy about new faces.

340
00:26:30,472 --> 00:26:33,532
Listen, buddy, if you're looking
for the diet frozen-yogurt bar...

341
00:26:33,708 --> 00:26:35,699
...it went out of business last summer.

342
00:26:35,877 --> 00:26:38,573
Actually,
I'm looking for a Batman number 14.

343
00:26:38,747 --> 00:26:40,271
That's a very serious book, man.

344
00:26:40,448 --> 00:26:41,710
Only five in existence.

345
00:26:41,883 --> 00:26:43,680
Four, actually.

346
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,616
I'm always looking out
for the other three.

347
00:27:27,362 --> 00:27:29,193
Edgar, since I know...

348
00:27:29,364 --> 00:27:32,561
...I'll never be able to talk you
out of what you're about to do...

349
00:27:33,001 --> 00:27:37,461
...I can't let you go up against a potential
head vampire without giving you this.

350
00:27:37,639 --> 00:27:41,097
One of the first books on vampire hunting
ever written.

351
00:27:41,276 --> 00:27:45,337
It'll hopefully keep you safe.
Watch your back. Alan.

352
00:27:46,014 --> 00:27:50,348
P.S. If you're still alive on Tuesday,
be sure to call Mom.

353
00:27:50,518 --> 00:27:52,418
It's her birthday.

354
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,954
ZOE Book O'Neer.
- Hey, Zoe.

355
00:27:56,124 --> 00:27:57,921
I need your help with something.

356
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,021
- It's important.
Sure.

357
00:28:00,195 --> 00:28:02,129
I'll be waiting.

358
00:28:09,037 --> 00:28:13,269
Wow, so the Gwen Lieber
hired you to find her kidnapped brother?

359
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,841
Yeah, and I think this book
might help me figure out...

360
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:17,204
...where they've taken him to.

361
00:28:17,379 --> 00:28:20,212
I need you to scour it for any clues,
anything you can find.

362
00:28:20,382 --> 00:28:25,285
I don't see how this old book is gonna
help you find anyone, but I'll give it a try.

363
00:28:25,887 --> 00:28:27,445
Do me a favor.

364
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:29,749
If you happen to run across
anything in here...

365
00:28:29,924 --> 00:28:34,190
...that talks about human sacrifice
or anything like that, make note of it.

366
00:28:34,362 --> 00:28:35,488
All right.

367
00:28:35,663 --> 00:28:36,823
Cool.

368
00:28:38,166 --> 00:28:40,566
Uh, do you wanna tell me why?

369
00:28:41,236 --> 00:28:42,897
Not really.

370
00:28:43,071 --> 00:28:45,631
Could put your life in danger.

371
00:28:48,076 --> 00:28:49,407
Okay.

372
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,234
Oh, my gosh.

373
00:29:50,572 --> 00:29:52,369
Where's Frog?

374
00:29:55,243 --> 00:29:56,574
Back off, fucko!

375
00:29:57,011 --> 00:29:59,445
Or what? You gonna mace me?

376
00:30:05,453 --> 00:30:06,920
Somebody needed a light?

377
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:09,818
Frog.

378
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,188
Ugly.

379
00:30:19,434 --> 00:30:20,628
You're dead.

380
00:30:21,469 --> 00:30:23,369
Suck on this.

381
00:30:34,182 --> 00:30:35,740
Watch out!

382
00:30:41,022 --> 00:30:42,922
Nice.

383
00:30:46,227 --> 00:30:47,626
Mace?

384
00:30:47,795 --> 00:30:49,729
Holy water.

385
00:30:50,698 --> 00:30:52,325
I feel like pancakes.

386
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,058
Order up.

387
00:30:55,203 --> 00:30:58,172
I found a whole section
of young male vampire sacrifices.

388
00:30:58,339 --> 00:31:00,330
And look, there's a Blood Moon.

389
00:31:00,508 --> 00:31:04,376
They call it that because the moon's face
is deep red or crimson hue.

390
00:31:04,546 --> 00:31:08,915
So they're gonna make a sacrifice
under the Blood Moon.

391
00:31:09,083 --> 00:31:10,107
Exactly.

392
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:13,721
This Friday is a Blood Moon.

393
00:31:13,888 --> 00:31:16,448
So they're gonna
sacrifice Peter at the rave.

394
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:20,583
- Well, Edgar, you can't let that happen.
- All right, if I'm gonna do this...

395
00:31:20,762 --> 00:31:23,959
...I need to find out where the rave is
and I need to find out fast.

396
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,327
Well, technically, raves are illegal...

397
00:31:26,501 --> 00:31:29,766
...so the promoters aren't gonna say
where it is until the last minute.

398
00:31:29,938 --> 00:31:33,135
You said that the rumor is that
it was gonna be here in San Cazador.

399
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:36,573
Even if it is here,
San Cazador is a big place.

400
00:31:38,947 --> 00:31:41,347
If we're gonna find out where that nest is...

401
00:31:41,516 --> 00:31:44,076
...we need to learn
how to think like a vampire.

402
00:31:44,252 --> 00:31:46,584
Bloodsuckers have a tendency
to look for a place...

403
00:31:46,754 --> 00:31:50,246
...that's got a history
of suffering and death.

404
00:31:50,592 --> 00:31:52,719
You know of a place like that here?

405
00:31:52,894 --> 00:31:55,727
There's an old slaughterhouse
on San Cazador Island.

406
00:31:56,264 --> 00:31:57,492
Slaughterhouse?

407
00:31:59,367 --> 00:32:00,561
Perfect.

408
00:32:00,735 --> 00:32:04,330
Nothing vampires love more
than blood and carnage.

409
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:09,499
If there's a slaughterhouse on that island,
that's where they'll be.

410
00:32:20,488 --> 00:32:22,479
Let me go.

411
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:25,587
- I promise, l...
- Uh-uh-uh.

412
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:29,258
Let's not make any promises
we can't keep.

413
00:32:29,731 --> 00:32:33,690
You just lie here
like a good piece of veal...

414
00:32:34,335 --> 00:32:38,931
...and maybe I'll bring you
a nice glass of warm milk.

415
00:33:14,108 --> 00:33:15,132
Hmm.

416
00:33:35,163 --> 00:33:36,494
So where are we going?

417
00:33:36,664 --> 00:33:38,393
My friend likes his privacy.

418
00:33:38,566 --> 00:33:39,658
The name's Blake.

419
00:33:39,834 --> 00:33:43,964
Used to be a congressman
before he learned the truth.

420
00:33:44,472 --> 00:33:47,464
What's up with all the razor wire?

421
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,357
Yo, Blake. Open up.

422
00:34:07,528 --> 00:34:09,223
It's Edgar.

423
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:25,044
Whew. Edgar.

424
00:34:25,213 --> 00:34:27,374
- How's it hanging?
- What's up, Blake?

425
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,180
Holy-water grenade.

426
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:30,544
- Nice touch.
- Yeah.

427
00:34:30,718 --> 00:34:33,186
- Needs a little work, though.
- Yeah.

428
00:34:33,354 --> 00:34:34,685
Who the hell's this?

429
00:34:34,856 --> 00:34:36,847
Oh, this is Zoe.

430
00:34:37,225 --> 00:34:38,249
She's cool.

431
00:34:38,426 --> 00:34:40,018
Yeah, I'll be the judge of that.

432
00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:44,723
Touch the cross. Do it now.

433
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:50,633
Zoe, manners.

434
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:54,004
- Nice to meet you.
- Blake.

435
00:34:54,442 --> 00:34:55,841
What's with the bike?

436
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:59,343
Oh, that's a beauty.
I've been working on her for a full year.

437
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:02,176
Renovations, the lot.
She's gonna be a real killer.

438
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:05,342
Yeah. Unfortunately, wouldn't do us
much good on this mission.

439
00:35:06,087 --> 00:35:07,111
What else you got?

440
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,750
Welcome to the lair.

441
00:35:12,827 --> 00:35:14,454
What happened to this thing?

442
00:35:15,096 --> 00:35:17,064
Looks like something
blew up in the barrel.

443
00:35:17,231 --> 00:35:19,665
You should see the vampire
I was pointing it at.

444
00:35:19,834 --> 00:35:22,530
Let's just say the gun came out
on the winning side.

445
00:35:23,337 --> 00:35:24,998
Nice new stuff, Blake.

446
00:35:25,173 --> 00:35:26,197
I like it.

447
00:35:29,644 --> 00:35:32,374
You looking for something
to replace your Old Reliable?

448
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:33,775
Never.

449
00:35:33,948 --> 00:35:35,643
Ah, you say that now.

450
00:35:37,151 --> 00:35:38,379
Feast your eyes on this.

451
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:42,045
An old Russki RG-6 grenade launcher.

452
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,918
Whoa.

453
00:35:44,292 --> 00:35:45,316
Heavy.

454
00:35:46,127 --> 00:35:49,119
Fires 40 mm fragmentation grenades.

455
00:35:49,297 --> 00:35:50,594
Not this one.

456
00:35:50,765 --> 00:35:52,756
This one fires these.

457
00:35:53,835 --> 00:35:54,961
What is it? Holy water?

458
00:35:55,136 --> 00:35:56,603
Mixed with a little garlic.

459
00:35:56,771 --> 00:35:57,897
Just for giggles.

460
00:35:59,006 --> 00:36:02,237
- I'll take it.
- I thought you might.

461
00:36:03,277 --> 00:36:05,973
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

462
00:36:09,684 --> 00:36:10,742
What's this?

463
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:12,783
Hey, put that down, please.

464
00:36:12,954 --> 00:36:14,785
Very carefully, okay?

465
00:36:14,956 --> 00:36:17,516
That is a prototype resin grenade.

466
00:36:17,692 --> 00:36:21,128
I stole it from a military testing facility
at Groom Lake.

467
00:36:22,496 --> 00:36:24,623
What does it do?
- Oh, shit.

468
00:36:32,473 --> 00:36:34,202
Cool.

469
00:36:34,642 --> 00:36:36,439
Yeah, cool.

470
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,738
I will take that other resin grenade,
though.

471
00:36:38,913 --> 00:36:40,312
Gotta hand it to the grays...

472
00:36:40,748 --> 00:36:43,683
...they sure are good at making weapons.

473
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:52,081
Well, it's a pleasure doing business
with you, Edgar, as always.

474
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,352
Mm.

475
00:36:53,527 --> 00:36:56,223
Say, you guys wanna stay for dinner?
I got beans.

476
00:36:57,598 --> 00:36:58,724
Yeah, you do.

477
00:37:10,411 --> 00:37:11,708
What the hell are these?

478
00:37:11,879 --> 00:37:13,346
Those?

479
00:37:13,514 --> 00:37:15,539
- Those are, uh...
- A reminder.

480
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:35,229
Vampires.

481
00:37:35,403 --> 00:37:37,735
They must have tracked us here.

482
00:37:41,776 --> 00:37:44,074
What did you do to them?
- High-powered UV lamps.

483
00:37:44,245 --> 00:37:46,611
Edgar, all the weapons are in the car.

484
00:37:47,448 --> 00:37:49,541
I guess we're gonna have to improvise.

485
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:10,063
They've taken out the UV lights.

486
00:38:14,809 --> 00:38:17,642
Hi, sweetheart,
aren't you gonna invite me in?

487
00:38:17,812 --> 00:38:20,406
No. You're not invited.

488
00:38:39,867 --> 00:38:41,494
Wait. Where are you going?

489
00:38:44,338 --> 00:38:46,272
Holy shit, we gotta get out of here.

490
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,964
They'll kill us if we go outside.

491
00:38:48,142 --> 00:38:50,667
I'd rather be bit than burned.
Come on, let's go!

492
00:38:55,716 --> 00:38:57,809
- Hi there.
- Guys, get down!

493
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:11,661
Say hello to Old Painless.

494
00:39:12,166 --> 00:39:14,657
Now, that's what I call a stakeout.

495
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:16,364
It's cool, right?

496
00:39:16,537 --> 00:39:18,368
Yeah, it should be. It's my design.

497
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:08,017
If all of these freaks go to the island
and take the Thirst at the rave...

498
00:40:08,189 --> 00:40:12,319
...we're gonna have a full-on
vampire invasion on our hands.

499
00:40:13,761 --> 00:40:15,558
Okay, man, you got the glow sticks?

500
00:40:15,729 --> 00:40:17,492
Let's roll.

501
00:40:18,566 --> 00:40:21,194
Oh, yeah.

502
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:23,265
Oh, yes.

503
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:24,801
Hey. You didn't tell me...

504
00:40:24,972 --> 00:40:26,997
...Lars Von Goetz was gonna be here.
Yeah.

505
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:29,267
- I was kind of hoping he wasn't.
Oh, yeah.

506
00:40:29,443 --> 00:40:31,343
That guy is a total animal.
Yes, baby.

507
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,980
You see the episode
where he wrestled the grizzly bear?

508
00:40:34,148 --> 00:40:35,376
- Missed it.
Oh, yeah.

509
00:40:38,219 --> 00:40:39,550
Toad.

510
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:43,149
Hmm.

511
00:40:43,724 --> 00:40:46,284
So, hmm, who's your friend?

512
00:40:47,962 --> 00:40:49,429
Hi. I'm Zoe.

513
00:40:49,597 --> 00:40:50,621
Zoe.

514
00:40:51,065 --> 00:40:52,623
Tell me, Zoe, is it just me...

515
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,463
...or is there some serious chemistry
between us?

516
00:40:56,637 --> 00:40:58,104
That's just you.

517
00:40:58,272 --> 00:40:59,967
Okay.

518
00:41:02,109 --> 00:41:03,371
Edgar.

519
00:41:04,478 --> 00:41:06,503
I hope you brought your bathing suit.

520
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,205
I thought we should blend in
with the other partygoers.

521
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:11,408
Covert infiltration.

522
00:41:11,585 --> 00:41:12,745
It's a good idea.

523
00:41:15,422 --> 00:41:16,821
Hi, I'm Gwen.

524
00:41:16,991 --> 00:41:21,155
Yeah, I know.
I've sold, like, a bazillion of your books.

525
00:41:21,328 --> 00:41:24,024
- I'm Zoe.
- Right.

526
00:41:24,798 --> 00:41:26,390
You work in a bookstore?

527
00:41:26,834 --> 00:41:27,960
Part-time.

528
00:41:28,135 --> 00:41:31,969
And Edgar thinks that you're qualified
for this mission?

529
00:41:32,373 --> 00:41:35,399
Just how many bloodsuckers
have you killed, Miss Lieber?

530
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:38,908
- None.
- More qualified than you.

531
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:43,311
Well, this is Edgar's show,
and I trust him.

532
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,411
Did I mention I hated her books?

533
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:49,817
So do I.

534
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:59,331
Rave!

535
00:42:02,903 --> 00:42:05,428
All right, everybody.
According to the blueprints...

536
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:09,633
...there's an entrance to the slaughterhouse
through a series of underground tunnels...

537
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:13,302
...which will lead us directly
to where the rave is.

538
00:42:13,747 --> 00:42:17,478
Now, remember, everyone,
there will be a lot of civilians around.

539
00:42:18,018 --> 00:42:20,384
Toadies, not familiars.

540
00:42:20,554 --> 00:42:24,581
Just innocent partygoers who are all there
because they think they're gonna have...

541
00:42:24,758 --> 00:42:26,453
...fun.

542
00:42:27,995 --> 00:42:29,895
Because of this, you will be armed...

543
00:42:30,064 --> 00:42:33,124
...with weapons that are non-lethal
to anything with a heartbeat.

544
00:42:33,567 --> 00:42:38,630
This is a sawed-off, pump action,
Soak and Destroy water gun.

545
00:42:40,007 --> 00:42:41,133
Patent pending.

546
00:42:42,042 --> 00:42:43,236
Turns holy water...

547
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:45,878
...into holy slaughter.

548
00:42:46,046 --> 00:42:47,638
Zoe, you take it.

549
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:48,839
Claus...

550
00:42:50,251 --> 00:42:52,151
...it's a high-powered UV torch.

551
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:55,220
Tie it around your waist.
You'll thank me later.

552
00:42:55,389 --> 00:42:57,357
Edgar, what about me?

553
00:42:58,259 --> 00:42:59,385
You're staying here.

554
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,088
The hell I am!

555
00:43:01,262 --> 00:43:03,321
This is my brother we are talking about.

556
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:05,431
I understand that...

557
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,067
...but this is not one of your books,
Gwen.

558
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:11,266
Everybody on this mission
is a trained veteran.

559
00:43:11,805 --> 00:43:14,706
You could be killed, or worse...

560
00:43:14,875 --> 00:43:18,367
...you could be turned into one of them.
Okay, time out.

561
00:43:18,545 --> 00:43:22,242
Listen, Gwen, I totally buy into
your little vampire goth games...

562
00:43:22,416 --> 00:43:25,351
...that's what you're paying me to do,
but I'm calling bullshit.

563
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:27,043
If Gwen wants to go, she can go.

564
00:43:27,488 --> 00:43:31,447
Not as long as I'm in charge
of this mission.

565
00:43:31,625 --> 00:43:33,354
It's all right, Lars.

566
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:35,961
Listen to him.
Edgar knows what he's talking about.

567
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:37,961
He's an experienced vampire hunter.

568
00:43:38,132 --> 00:43:41,226
Wrong. I'm sorry to be the one
to break this to you...

569
00:43:41,402 --> 00:43:43,962
...but there are no
experienced vampire hunters...

570
00:43:44,138 --> 00:43:47,039
...because there are no vampires.
They do not exist.

571
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:48,868
Hmm.

572
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:52,302
Zoe, take these stakes,
strap them to your leg.

573
00:43:52,479 --> 00:43:54,140
And why does she get stakes?

574
00:43:54,315 --> 00:43:56,840
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you were Mr. Tough Guy...

575
00:43:57,017 --> 00:44:00,953
...who wrestled a 6-foot alligator with your
bare hands. You don't need weapons.

576
00:44:01,121 --> 00:44:03,180
No, it was 10-foot.

577
00:44:03,357 --> 00:44:05,416
- And I still want stakes.
- Fine.

578
00:44:07,161 --> 00:44:08,458
There's some stakes.

579
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:11,392
Why are hers metal?

580
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:14,063
You get what you get.

581
00:44:14,802 --> 00:44:16,531
Let's go.

582
00:44:18,005 --> 00:44:19,233
Edgar, wait.

583
00:44:21,675 --> 00:44:23,074
Bring him back safe.

584
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:24,972
I'll do my best.

585
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:26,572
Move out.

586
00:44:29,283 --> 00:44:30,307
Hey, Toad.

587
00:44:30,484 --> 00:44:33,885
Couldn't we come back at night?
It would look so much better on camera.

588
00:44:34,054 --> 00:44:36,284
No. Vampires feed at night...

589
00:44:36,457 --> 00:44:39,915
...and I don't plan on
sticking around for dinner.

590
00:45:18,031 --> 00:45:20,363
Is this the VIP room?

591
00:45:20,901 --> 00:45:23,597
Oh, most definitely.

592
00:45:23,771 --> 00:45:27,764
- When's the party supposed to start?
- Not for a while.

593
00:45:27,941 --> 00:45:30,739
You guys got here early.

594
00:45:31,412 --> 00:45:35,314
Oh, are those promise rings?

595
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:38,815
- So cute.
Is that blood on your face?

596
00:46:19,259 --> 00:46:22,057
Oh! I think I just broke my coccyx.

597
00:46:22,229 --> 00:46:24,561
Forget the coccyx, is the camera okay?

598
00:46:40,981 --> 00:46:43,279
Radio check.
Check.

599
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:45,782
Check.
Check.

600
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:53,057
All right. Once inside,
our main objective is to extract Peter.

601
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:55,787
Killing vampires is our second priority.

602
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:58,061
All right, everybody...

603
00:46:58,232 --> 00:46:59,460
...let's rock 'n' roll.

604
00:47:10,177 --> 00:47:11,838
Heads up.

605
00:47:14,548 --> 00:47:16,345
Hey, did you name your new gun yet?

606
00:47:16,517 --> 00:47:18,007
Shh.

607
00:47:19,219 --> 00:47:20,516
What?

608
00:47:20,687 --> 00:47:23,747
Did you name your new gun yet?

609
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:27,784
What are you talking about?

610
00:47:27,961 --> 00:47:29,929
All guns need a name.

611
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:31,587
Like boats.

612
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:33,562
Boats are for sailors...

613
00:47:33,734 --> 00:47:36,328
...guns are for soldiers.

614
00:47:36,503 --> 00:47:38,494
I'm no sailor.

615
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:45,104
- Lars.
What?

616
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:47,577
I'm getting a really bad feeling about this.

617
00:47:47,748 --> 00:47:52,617
Ugh. What, you mean being deep within
the earth beneath a thousand tons of rock?

618
00:47:54,655 --> 00:47:58,250
Are you feeling "Claus-trophobic"?

619
00:47:58,926 --> 00:48:01,121
Get it? "Claus-trophobic"?

620
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,695
That's not funny.
I'm serious, man, look around you.

621
00:48:03,864 --> 00:48:06,128
This shit's freaking me out.

622
00:48:23,383 --> 00:48:24,941
Jeepers.

623
00:48:46,239 --> 00:48:47,763
All right, here's the deal.

624
00:48:47,941 --> 00:48:50,466
We're gonna go to the left,
you guys go to the right.

625
00:48:50,644 --> 00:48:52,305
Zoe, you're with me.

626
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:56,245
Lars and Claus, do whatever it is you do.

627
00:48:56,416 --> 00:48:58,748
We'll reconvene back on the beach...

628
00:48:58,919 --> 00:49:00,614
...maybe.

629
00:49:08,462 --> 00:49:10,555
You know,
I kind of hate the fact we split up.

630
00:49:10,731 --> 00:49:14,030
People in horror movies always split up
and they always get killed.

631
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,761
There's nothing to worry about, Claus.
Don't you get it?

632
00:49:16,937 --> 00:49:18,905
This is all some stupid role-playing game.

633
00:49:19,072 --> 00:49:23,168
All we're gonna find is some little emo goth
kids with fake fangs and contact lenses.

634
00:49:23,343 --> 00:49:24,935
You think this is a game?

635
00:49:25,112 --> 00:49:29,446
Of course I think it's a game. Why else
would the Toad give me a water pistol?

636
00:49:30,817 --> 00:49:35,550
Besides, my fans are tired of seeing me
tackle every natural predator on the planet.

637
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:38,020
Now, we need to give them
something new to watch.

638
00:49:38,191 --> 00:49:39,283
But if you're right...

639
00:49:39,459 --> 00:49:43,225
...you're gonna be beating up a bunch
of kids with fake fangs and contact lenses.

640
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:44,830
I know.

641
00:49:44,998 --> 00:49:46,192
Isn't it great?

642
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:05,513
This is the entrance
to the slaughterhouse.

643
00:50:05,686 --> 00:50:09,178
Time for Mr. Frog's wild ride.

644
00:50:10,991 --> 00:50:12,515
Ow.

645
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:18,595
Claus, we gotta find a place
to do my intro.

646
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:21,097
Oh, yeah.

647
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:22,496
This is perfect.

648
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,832
Okay.

649
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:30,871
Using my tracking ability,
we've located the nest of the vampires...

650
00:50:31,044 --> 00:50:33,877
...deep within
this abandoned slaughterhouse.

651
00:50:34,314 --> 00:50:35,872
It's also haunted...

652
00:50:36,049 --> 00:50:38,540
...by cannibal pirates.

653
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:42,646
It's built on an
ancient Indian burial ground...

654
00:50:45,392 --> 00:50:48,088
...where they used to burn witches.

655
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:31,132
Oh.

656
00:51:36,543 --> 00:51:38,067
A promise ring.

657
00:51:38,245 --> 00:51:39,678
Virgins.

658
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:43,247
Vampire filet mignon.

659
00:51:52,259 --> 00:51:56,423
Ugh. What kind of fucked up shit is this?

660
00:51:56,596 --> 00:51:58,427
Are you Peter?

661
00:51:59,132 --> 00:52:01,225
Please, help me.

662
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:05,765
Dude. Turn around, let's go.

663
00:52:05,939 --> 00:52:07,873
- What?
- It's too early to find him.

664
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:10,168
We gotta find him
at the end of the episode.

665
00:52:10,343 --> 00:52:13,471
I haven't even had the chance
to put the beat-down on any goths yet.

666
00:52:13,647 --> 00:52:15,877
- But he's right here.
- Dude, turn around.

667
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:17,676
Sorry, Peter. Let's go.

668
00:52:17,851 --> 00:52:19,148
What the fuck?

669
00:52:19,319 --> 00:52:22,049
Where are you bastards going?

670
00:52:25,592 --> 00:52:28,220
Something smells really bad in here.

671
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:30,260
It's a slaughterhouse.

672
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:35,026
I don't mean the typical
bad slaughterhouse dead meat smell...

673
00:52:35,202 --> 00:52:38,296
...I mean I smell something...
It smells like rotting garbage.

674
00:52:38,471 --> 00:52:39,631
Trash.

675
00:52:39,806 --> 00:52:42,138
Yeah, like I said. Rotting garbage.

676
00:52:42,309 --> 00:52:43,367
No.

677
00:52:43,543 --> 00:52:47,877
I mean Jonny Trash.

678
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:51,316
Jeez Louise.

679
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:54,413
Jeez Louise? Really?

680
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:58,781
Zoe, get down!

681
00:53:08,702 --> 00:53:11,000
You hear that?
What?

682
00:53:11,671 --> 00:53:13,468
I think it's coming from down there.

683
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:16,534
What are you doing?

684
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:18,337
Lars.

685
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:21,112
Lars.

686
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:50,833
Dude, where's my gear?

687
00:53:51,411 --> 00:53:53,038
You left it up...

688
00:53:54,547 --> 00:53:55,844
Oh, shit.

689
00:53:56,016 --> 00:53:57,313
What?

690
00:53:59,419 --> 00:54:01,512
Oh, okay.

691
00:54:36,489 --> 00:54:37,922
Is this it?

692
00:54:38,091 --> 00:54:42,357
I've been waiting 300 years
for a good fight.

693
00:55:05,952 --> 00:55:08,182
Have you had enough, punk?

694
00:55:37,217 --> 00:55:39,811
Nice outfit.

695
00:55:39,986 --> 00:55:41,419
That's funny...

696
00:55:42,889 --> 00:55:45,084
...that's exactly what I was thinking.

697
00:55:45,258 --> 00:55:46,691
But I still have to kill you.

698
00:55:50,363 --> 00:55:51,853
I'm surprised.

699
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:54,365
By what?

700
00:55:56,169 --> 00:55:59,002
You're really not that good.

701
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:07,538
- Aah!
Edgar!

702
00:56:22,662 --> 00:56:24,357
Zoe. I got this.

703
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:40,173
Ah, shit! Damn bullets!

704
00:56:40,747 --> 00:56:43,409
See, now that's what happens
when you don't name your gun.

705
00:56:43,583 --> 00:56:45,414
Just pull out the sword!

706
00:56:45,885 --> 00:56:48,080
- On three.
- Okay.

707
00:56:48,521 --> 00:56:49,579
Three.

708
00:56:50,957 --> 00:56:53,517
What happened to one and two?

709
00:56:53,693 --> 00:56:56,890
Edgar? Edgar? Oh, God.

710
00:56:57,063 --> 00:56:58,724
Lars, what's your 20?

711
00:56:59,365 --> 00:57:02,163
- It's not Lars, it's Claus.
- Claus, where's Lars?

712
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:03,359
He's dead.

713
00:57:03,536 --> 00:57:04,764
Lars is dead.

714
00:57:04,938 --> 00:57:07,406
We're so completely and totally fucked.

715
00:57:07,574 --> 00:57:09,337
Claus, calm down. Just breathe.

716
00:57:09,809 --> 00:57:12,744
We have to get Edgar out of here
before reinforcements arrive.

717
00:57:21,921 --> 00:57:25,288
- Oh, my God. Zoe, what happened?
Just help us lay him down.

718
00:57:25,458 --> 00:57:27,221
Claus, first-aid kit.

719
00:57:31,664 --> 00:57:33,859
Hang in there.
Everything's gonna be fine.

720
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:35,398
Hold this.

721
00:57:35,568 --> 00:57:39,231
Edgar, stay with me.

722
00:57:45,912 --> 00:57:49,279
Notice anything unusual
about Santa Carla yet?

723
00:57:49,449 --> 00:57:52,350
No, it's a pretty cool place...

724
00:57:52,519 --> 00:57:53,577
...if you're a Martian.

725
00:57:53,753 --> 00:57:54,981
Or a vampire.

726
00:57:56,022 --> 00:57:58,286
Are you guys sniffing old newsprint
or something?

727
00:57:58,458 --> 00:58:01,154
You think you know what's
happening around here, don't you?

728
00:58:01,327 --> 00:58:03,989
Well, I'll tell you something.
You don't know shit, buddy.

729
00:58:04,164 --> 00:58:08,066
Yeah. You think we just work
in a comic-book store for our folks, huh?

730
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:10,259
Actually, I thought it was a bakery.

731
00:58:10,436 --> 00:58:11,630
This is just our cover.

732
00:58:12,839 --> 00:58:15,273
We're dedicated to a higher purpose.

733
00:58:15,441 --> 00:58:17,875
We're fighters for truth...

734
00:58:18,044 --> 00:58:19,409
...justice...

735
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:21,479
...and the American way.

736
00:58:21,648 --> 00:58:23,479
Edgar.

737
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:28,913
- Edgar.
- What?

738
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:31,147
- What happened to me?
- You're okay.

739
00:58:31,891 --> 00:58:34,826
Did we get him? Did we get Peter?

740
00:58:34,994 --> 00:58:38,259
Claus found him,
but they ran into some trouble.

741
00:58:38,698 --> 00:58:42,134
They had him tied
to some twisted table kind of thing...

742
00:58:42,302 --> 00:58:44,930
...pumping him full of drugs,
trying to keep him sedated.

743
00:58:45,104 --> 00:58:47,698
Where's your boss? Von Geek?

744
00:58:47,874 --> 00:58:51,139
Some big-ass, massive juggernaut
of a vampire got him.

745
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:54,102
Tore his heart right out of his chest.

746
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:56,942
Got it on tape, though.

747
00:58:58,418 --> 00:59:00,318
I'd like to see that
when you get a chance.

748
00:59:00,486 --> 00:59:02,977
- He'd like that.
- Thanks.

749
00:59:03,923 --> 00:59:05,288
Gwen...

750
00:59:05,992 --> 00:59:07,789
...it's gonna be okay.

751
00:59:08,328 --> 00:59:10,023
We'll get him.

752
00:59:10,196 --> 00:59:12,221
It's not over yet.

753
00:59:17,403 --> 00:59:18,529
Payback's a bitch.

754
00:59:18,705 --> 00:59:21,196
Damn straight. Let's go.

755
00:59:25,044 --> 00:59:26,705
Rave! Rave!

756
00:59:31,584 --> 00:59:32,744
It's starting.

757
00:59:35,521 --> 00:59:37,318
All right, come on.

758
00:59:40,126 --> 00:59:41,525
Hey!

759
01:00:04,050 --> 01:00:05,517
Hey, there.

760
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:06,743
Do you wanna party?

761
01:00:21,434 --> 01:00:27,236
LILY And now,
the man you've been waiting for, DJ X!

762
01:00:44,157 --> 01:00:48,389
Are you ready for a sacrifice?

763
01:00:57,704 --> 01:01:00,605
Blood, blood, blood!

764
01:01:00,773 --> 01:01:03,401
Blood, blood, blood!

765
01:01:03,576 --> 01:01:06,136
Blood, blood, blood!

766
01:01:06,312 --> 01:01:07,336
Hold up.

767
01:01:08,047 --> 01:01:10,641
Oh, my God. There he is.

768
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:46,547
If they get through that fence,
we're so undeniably fucked.

769
01:01:46,719 --> 01:01:49,654
The sooner we take out X,
the sooner that won't be a problem.

770
01:01:49,822 --> 01:01:51,312
Okay, but what about Peter?

771
01:01:56,696 --> 01:01:59,460
All right, listen up, everyone.
I want you all to hold back.

772
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:01,224
I've only got one shot at this.

773
01:02:01,401 --> 01:02:04,461
I'm gonna immobilize X
and then we go in for the kill.

774
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:07,105
Everybody, stay put. Got it?

775
01:02:07,273 --> 01:02:08,797
- Got it.
- Good.

776
01:02:35,368 --> 01:02:37,529
Put on something nasty, X.

777
01:02:37,703 --> 01:02:40,103
I think I found someone
I wanna dance with.

778
01:02:43,242 --> 01:02:45,142
He dropped it. I'm going in.

779
01:02:45,311 --> 01:02:46,903
Zoe, wait.

780
01:02:47,079 --> 01:02:48,603
Get in here and help me. Come on.

781
01:03:03,663 --> 01:03:07,531
That is exactly
how I'm going to break your neck.

782
01:03:11,437 --> 01:03:14,133
Vinyl still shreds.

783
01:03:30,256 --> 01:03:32,451
Very creative, Frog.

784
01:03:36,195 --> 01:03:38,163
But when it comes to killing...

785
01:03:38,331 --> 01:03:44,395
...I prefer more traditional methods...

786
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:47,334
...like impalement.

787
01:04:36,489 --> 01:04:39,390
Claus, cover us!

788
01:04:41,327 --> 01:04:43,192
Shit. Shit.

789
01:04:51,404 --> 01:04:53,872
You fought admirably.

790
01:04:55,341 --> 01:04:59,175
But you were doomed to fail
from the start.

791
01:05:01,213 --> 01:05:04,273
I've fought beside great warriors...

792
01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:05,940
...learned battle techniques...

793
01:05:06,118 --> 01:05:11,055
...that can only be mastered
over several lifetimes.

794
01:05:15,127 --> 01:05:20,087
And do you know
what the first rule of combat is?

795
01:05:22,101 --> 01:05:25,662
Yeah, don't monologue.

796
01:05:33,713 --> 01:05:35,738
There's a lot of vampires down here.

797
01:06:03,909 --> 01:06:06,104
Guys, I can't hold them off forever.

798
01:06:15,321 --> 01:06:17,221
Fuck me. Fuck me!

799
01:06:23,596 --> 01:06:24,995
Edgar!

800
01:06:25,431 --> 01:06:27,262
Nice work. I've got it.

801
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:44,944
You're right. Impalement is good.

802
01:06:45,818 --> 01:06:48,343
Especially when you pierce the heart.

803
01:07:04,003 --> 01:07:05,698
Peter.

804
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:11,440
All right, everybody, listen up.
The party's officially over.

805
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:15,046
You don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.

806
01:07:17,550 --> 01:07:19,518
Peter, can you hear me?

807
01:07:32,398 --> 01:07:34,332
- Eew.
- Buckets of eew.

808
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:36,991
Edgar, something's wrong.

809
01:07:37,169 --> 01:07:38,397
Yeah, I'd say.

810
01:07:38,571 --> 01:07:42,974
No, I mean we killed DJ X,
but I don't feel any different.

811
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:45,736
Something's wrong.

812
01:07:49,081 --> 01:07:52,414
They're still vampires. Nothing's changed.

813
01:07:52,585 --> 01:07:54,246
Edgar...

814
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:56,718
...this smells like garlic.

815
01:07:58,357 --> 01:08:00,154
Garlic?

816
01:08:00,326 --> 01:08:01,759
Let me see.

817
01:08:03,195 --> 01:08:06,392
You're right, it...
They were keeping him weak.

818
01:08:08,634 --> 01:08:10,659
You're the alpha.

819
01:08:10,836 --> 01:08:12,895
Oh, I bet you did not see that coming.

820
01:08:13,572 --> 01:08:14,937
Thanks to you.

821
01:08:15,107 --> 01:08:18,372
If X had been able to drink my blood
during the Blood Moon...

822
01:08:18,544 --> 01:08:21,035
...my power would have passed to him...

823
01:08:21,213 --> 01:08:23,738
...and that would have been a shame.

824
01:08:23,916 --> 01:08:27,647
I've been the alpha for a long, long time.

825
01:08:52,812 --> 01:08:56,441
You'll never grow old, you'll never die...

826
01:08:56,882 --> 01:08:58,645
...but you must feed.

827
01:09:04,623 --> 01:09:07,786
I brought you Edgar Frog,
just like you asked.

828
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:09,427
Now it is your turn.

829
01:09:09,595 --> 01:09:12,462
Remember your promise to me.

830
01:09:12,998 --> 01:09:15,466
I just don't wanna grow old. Sorry.

831
01:09:16,936 --> 01:09:18,767
Oh...

832
01:09:19,438 --> 01:09:20,462
...you won't.

833
01:09:45,564 --> 01:09:47,532
They're all yours!

834
01:09:48,367 --> 01:09:49,959
Alan, wait!

835
01:09:51,737 --> 01:09:55,503
No, no, no, this is not a good time
for the batteries to die.

836
01:09:55,674 --> 01:09:58,871
Claus, I need you to get Zoe to safety.

837
01:10:00,212 --> 01:10:02,544
Edgar, I'm not leaving without you.

838
01:10:02,715 --> 01:10:04,080
If we don't kill Peter right now...

839
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:07,515
...there's gonna be a thousand
emo-goth vampires out there.

840
01:10:07,686 --> 01:10:09,984
I need you to warn the world.

841
01:10:10,155 --> 01:10:11,884
Especially in case I don't survive.

842
01:10:12,591 --> 01:10:14,252
That's not an option.

843
01:10:16,762 --> 01:10:17,990
I'll be waiting.

844
01:10:19,331 --> 01:10:20,696
Just go.

845
01:10:23,636 --> 01:10:24,728
Come on.

846
01:10:26,739 --> 01:10:28,366
Claus.

847
01:10:52,364 --> 01:10:54,332
I'm disappointed in you, Edgar.

848
01:10:54,767 --> 01:10:57,201
This is no way to treat your savior.

849
01:10:57,369 --> 01:11:01,203
Savior? You got a funny way
of looking at things, kid.

850
01:11:01,373 --> 01:11:03,568
I saved you from a life of Ioneliness.

851
01:11:04,176 --> 01:11:07,304
You didn't want to end up
like Robert Neville, did you? Ha, ha.

852
01:11:07,479 --> 01:11:11,006
Robert who?
- You really should read more books, Edgar.

853
01:11:12,584 --> 01:11:15,246
The ones without pictures
and word balloons.

854
01:11:15,754 --> 01:11:19,850
Robert Neville,
the protagonist in I Am Legend.

855
01:11:20,025 --> 01:11:24,189
Last man on Earth
in a world full of vampires.

856
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:26,861
Is that really what you want to become?

857
01:11:27,333 --> 01:11:30,791
I'm not thirsty.
You'll have to kill me first.

858
01:11:35,641 --> 01:11:37,370
I will, if necessary.

859
01:11:41,914 --> 01:11:44,041
But that would be a shame...

860
01:11:44,216 --> 01:11:47,549
...especially since I owe you a debt
for killing X.

861
01:11:48,153 --> 01:11:51,486
Why didn't you just kill him yourself?

862
01:11:51,790 --> 01:11:54,816
A father can't murder his own children.

863
01:11:54,994 --> 01:11:57,155
That would be in bad taste.

864
01:11:57,329 --> 01:12:00,298
Even an impertinent little shit like DJ X.

865
01:12:02,601 --> 01:12:06,901
I told him you can't turn all the cattle
into cowboys...

866
01:12:07,072 --> 01:12:09,939
...you'll wind up with too many cowboys.

867
01:12:10,109 --> 01:12:11,133
But he didn't listen.

868
01:12:11,310 --> 01:12:13,073
And now, thanks to his damned raves...

869
01:12:13,245 --> 01:12:16,681
...there are going to be far too many
vampires roaming the Earth.

870
01:12:16,849 --> 01:12:18,009
That's where you come in.

871
01:12:18,183 --> 01:12:21,084
Keep the population down
to a manageable size.

872
01:12:22,087 --> 01:12:23,782
Plenty of blood to drink.

873
01:12:24,223 --> 01:12:26,123
Everybody's happy.

874
01:12:26,291 --> 01:12:27,588
Precisely.

875
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:33,096
Which is why I want you to keep on doing
what you're already so very good at.

876
01:12:33,265 --> 01:12:36,029
Hunting and killing vampires.

877
01:12:36,201 --> 01:12:41,400
So you want me to be your own personal
hemo-sucking hit man, is that it?

878
01:12:41,573 --> 01:12:43,097
Crudely worded...

879
01:12:43,542 --> 01:12:46,602
...but yes, that's the general idea.

880
01:12:49,815 --> 01:12:52,079
And what makes you think...

881
01:12:52,251 --> 01:12:55,220
...that I won't just kill you myself?

882
01:12:55,387 --> 01:12:56,513
Nothing.

883
01:12:56,688 --> 01:12:59,122
Except that you have no real reason.

884
01:13:01,060 --> 01:13:02,857
Think about it, Edgar.

885
01:13:03,028 --> 01:13:05,553
Your brother's already one of us.

886
01:13:05,731 --> 01:13:10,998
Everyone you care about
is either dead or playing for my team.

887
01:13:11,870 --> 01:13:12,996
What do you say?

888
01:13:13,939 --> 01:13:15,065
I say...

889
01:13:16,775 --> 01:13:18,538
...why don't you go suck yourself?

890
01:13:20,913 --> 01:13:24,144
Alan, kill your brother. You'll feel better.

891
01:13:24,850 --> 01:13:25,908
Alan, no.

892
01:13:26,585 --> 01:13:28,610
Don't do this.

893
01:13:29,555 --> 01:13:31,113
You're my brother.

894
01:13:31,290 --> 01:13:32,814
You're a Frog Brother.

895
01:13:38,363 --> 01:13:41,491
Don't make me hurt you.

896
01:13:45,204 --> 01:13:47,331
I told you not to make me hurt you.

897
01:14:03,589 --> 01:14:06,285
Last chance, Edgar.

898
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:17,358
What the fuck?

899
01:14:29,815 --> 01:14:31,612
Fuck you!

900
01:14:55,340 --> 01:14:56,967
You okay?

901
01:14:57,876 --> 01:14:59,138
Yeah.

902
01:14:59,311 --> 01:15:00,642
Fang check.

903
01:15:04,850 --> 01:15:06,442
Hmm.

904
01:15:06,618 --> 01:15:08,142
Death to all vampires?

905
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:10,049
Maximum body count.

906
01:15:10,222 --> 01:15:13,157
We are awesome monster bashers.

907
01:15:13,325 --> 01:15:15,088
- The meanest.
- The baddest.

908
01:15:24,870 --> 01:15:26,599
That's enough of that.

909
01:16:05,310 --> 01:16:08,837
Hey. I thought you went to the beach
with your brother?

910
01:16:09,014 --> 01:16:13,178
I did, actually, but, uh,
he wanted to stay out there longer.

911
01:16:13,352 --> 01:16:17,049
He stays out much longer, he's gonna
turn into a human piece of beef jerky.

912
01:16:18,423 --> 01:16:20,050
I guess he's making up for lost time.

913
01:16:20,225 --> 01:16:22,659
Yeah.
- Oh, guess what.

914
01:16:23,862 --> 01:16:27,161
I sold your copy of Destroy All Vampires
number 125...

915
01:16:27,599 --> 01:16:29,260
...for 500 bucks.

916
01:16:29,434 --> 01:16:30,526
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

917
01:16:30,702 --> 01:16:31,828
That's great.

918
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:34,734
That should keep the bank off my butt
for a while.

919
01:16:34,906 --> 01:16:38,273
Now, Zoe,
there's something I need to ask you.

920
01:16:38,810 --> 01:16:41,745
How did you know vampires are real?

921
01:16:41,913 --> 01:16:43,676
Just a hunch.

922
01:16:44,449 --> 01:16:45,973
What are you reading?

923
01:16:46,151 --> 01:16:49,518
Oh, I'm actually scanning the book
into my Kindle.

924
01:16:49,688 --> 01:16:50,848
I decided, you know...

925
01:16:51,023 --> 01:16:55,551
...I might as well educate myself about
all the possibilities of the dark underworld.

926
01:16:55,727 --> 01:16:58,787
For example,
did you know that lycanthrope...

927
01:16:58,964 --> 01:17:02,263
...or female werewolves, she-wolves...

928
01:17:02,768 --> 01:17:05,896
...actually can change
anytime they want to?

929
01:17:06,071 --> 01:17:08,801
They don't have to do it under a full moon.
That's a myth.

930
01:17:08,974 --> 01:17:11,067
They can turn anytime they want to.

931
01:17:11,243 --> 01:17:14,371
They have complete control.
They can do it in the middle of the day.

932
01:17:16,748 --> 01:17:19,717
Now, that's an interesting theory.
