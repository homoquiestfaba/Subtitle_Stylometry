1
00:00:20,648 --> 00:00:25,648
(dramatic orchestral music)

2
00:00:45,088 --> 00:00:46,258
There.

3
00:00:46,758 --> 00:00:47,888
That's better.

4
00:00:56,518 --> 00:00:59,318
Well, my friends, how are you?

5
00:01:03,518 --> 00:01:05,658
Oh don't answer that question, I can see.

6
00:01:06,818 --> 00:01:10,021
Young and healthy, cool,
calm, and collected.

7
00:01:10,368 --> 00:01:11,538
And contented.

8
00:01:11,941 --> 00:01:13,738
And so you should be contented.

9
00:01:14,248 --> 00:01:16,118
You all lead custody lives.

10
00:01:16,788 --> 00:01:18,628
You're carried from adventure to adventure

11
00:01:18,628 --> 00:01:20,658
in your warm, comfortable trunk.

12
00:01:21,088 --> 00:01:22,418
And who carries you?

13
00:01:22,758 --> 00:01:23,758
I do.

14
00:01:24,338 --> 00:01:26,412
A frail, fragile old man.

15
00:01:27,081 --> 00:01:28,548
Do I need (mumble)?

16
00:01:28,968 --> 00:01:32,098
Next time I cut off your feet, and I'll

17
00:01:32,098 --> 00:01:34,008
put you up on wheels, and you can

18
00:01:34,008 --> 00:01:36,138
all pull me along in the trunk.

19
00:01:38,468 --> 00:01:41,398
Oh don't look so worried,
it may never happen.

20
00:01:41,938 --> 00:01:44,318
Well we'll rest here tonight, and tomorrow

21
00:01:44,318 --> 00:01:46,198
we'll be safe in Switzerland.

22
00:01:47,948 --> 00:01:50,520
Now let's see if I can find
something for us to eat.

23
00:01:51,408 --> 00:01:56,408
(dramatic cello music)

24
00:02:30,698 --> 00:02:32,738
Well I found this tin of sardines.

25
00:02:34,828 --> 00:02:36,658
All I need now is a tin opener.

26
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:41,708
What is it?

27
00:02:42,378 --> 00:02:43,708
What have you found?

28
00:02:47,951 --> 00:02:49,128
Well...

29
00:02:52,748 --> 00:02:53,808
Well.

30
00:02:55,218 --> 00:02:56,638
Cyclops.

31
00:02:58,228 --> 00:02:59,591
Cyclops.

32
00:03:01,188 --> 00:03:03,268
He was one of the first of the family.

33
00:03:08,848 --> 00:03:10,858
It all began, I suppose...

34
00:03:11,908 --> 00:03:16,908
One day with old Afzel in Cairo long ago.

35
00:03:20,168 --> 00:03:22,748
(music intensifies)

36
00:03:58,578 --> 00:04:01,328
(speaking foreign language)

37
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:09,202
Those who steal the
secrets of the Gods must die!

38
00:04:09,202 --> 00:04:12,081
Those who steal the
secrets of the Gods must die!

39
00:04:12,621 --> 00:04:14,928
Feel the power of Sutekh!

40
00:04:14,928 --> 00:04:16,888
Feel the power of Sutekh!

41
00:04:17,928 --> 00:04:21,098
(otherworldly sounds)
(groaning)

42
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,238
(sigh of relief)

43
00:04:37,028 --> 00:04:39,658
No so powerful as once he was,

44
00:04:39,658 --> 00:04:41,618
this god of yours.

45
00:04:42,118 --> 00:04:45,998
One day he will be just like his temples.

46
00:04:46,658 --> 00:04:48,878
Die, sorcerer!

47
00:04:48,878 --> 00:04:50,548
Die, sorcerer!

48
00:04:51,418 --> 00:04:52,378
Yes.

49
00:04:53,378 --> 00:04:54,661
I will die.

50
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:57,678
But not today.

51
00:04:59,308 --> 00:05:02,048
(speaking foreign language)

52
00:05:22,408 --> 00:05:26,458
No, Sutekh, not today.

53
00:05:41,768 --> 00:05:45,438
[Sutekh] Rise, slaves of Sutekh!

54
00:05:46,308 --> 00:05:48,608
Rise from the sands!

55
00:05:49,398 --> 00:05:52,138
Rise from the dead!

56
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:00,238
Awaken!

57
00:06:01,078 --> 00:06:02,538
Breathe!

58
00:06:03,448 --> 00:06:04,868
Live!

59
00:06:07,538 --> 00:06:09,032
Who am I?

60
00:06:10,281 --> 00:06:12,628
You are Sutekh, our lord.

61
00:06:13,118 --> 00:06:15,588
Most holy and terrible.

62
00:06:16,048 --> 00:06:19,548
Sutekh, most holy and terrible.

63
00:06:19,888 --> 00:06:22,428
Sutekh, most holy and terrible.

64
00:06:22,808 --> 00:06:24,008
[Sutekh] Who are you?

65
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,548
Your slave.

66
00:06:25,848 --> 00:06:27,098
Your slave.

67
00:06:27,098 --> 00:06:28,478
Your slave.

68
00:06:30,552 --> 00:06:32,638
[Sutekh] You know my will, slaves.

69
00:06:32,638 --> 00:06:36,988
A sorcerer has stolen my great
secret, the secret of life.

70
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:40,238
He flees now to (mumble)
with the infidels.

71
00:06:40,238 --> 00:06:42,438
Disguise yourselves and follow him.

72
00:06:42,438 --> 00:06:46,198
Destroy him and all to
whom knows my secret.

73
00:06:46,578 --> 00:06:48,248
Hear my command!

74
00:06:48,248 --> 00:06:51,610
All who learn the secret of life must die!

75
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:53,378
Go, slaves!

76
00:06:55,378 --> 00:06:56,298
Come.

77
00:06:57,338 --> 00:06:59,298
[Sutekh] And do not fail me.

78
00:07:03,638 --> 00:07:05,348
The world was younger then.

79
00:07:06,678 --> 00:07:08,468
And so indeed was I.

80
00:07:10,178 --> 00:07:15,148
(whimsical orchestral music)

81
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,641
Let's begin.

82
00:08:03,398 --> 00:08:08,398
(triumphant orchestral music)

83
00:11:07,244 --> 00:11:10,344
[Margarette] Ilsa,
Ilsa please just wait!

84
00:11:11,014 --> 00:11:12,168
Wait a moment.

85
00:11:12,544 --> 00:11:13,554
Where are you going?

86
00:11:13,554 --> 00:11:14,794
Where am I going?

87
00:11:15,094 --> 00:11:16,924
Margarette, we're in Paris.

88
00:11:17,174 --> 00:11:18,174
Don't you want to see it?

89
00:11:18,174 --> 00:11:19,354
We see it every day.

90
00:11:19,354 --> 00:11:21,014
Shopping, the proper places with

91
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,434
chaperones, that's not Paris.

92
00:11:24,274 --> 00:11:25,314
Do you know Paris doesn't even

93
00:11:25,314 --> 00:11:27,307
wake up until after midnight.

94
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:31,824
There's excitement out there, magic.

95
00:11:32,364 --> 00:11:33,784
I want to find it.

96
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:35,744
If your father finds out you're

97
00:11:35,744 --> 00:11:37,704
sneaking off in the middle of the night,

98
00:11:37,704 --> 00:11:39,947
you'll find yourself being shipped

99
00:11:39,947 --> 00:11:42,074
back home to Geneva.

100
00:11:42,414 --> 00:11:44,414
Being cooped up in here and trotted off

101
00:11:44,414 --> 00:11:47,084
to dance with old men at embassy balls,

102
00:11:47,084 --> 00:11:49,577
we might as well be back in Geneva.

103
00:11:50,044 --> 00:11:54,554
Besides, he won't do anything
if he doesn't find out.

104
00:11:55,174 --> 00:11:59,184
Okay, but please be careful and don't

105
00:11:59,184 --> 00:12:01,514
go into any opium dens.

106
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:10,434
(uplifting orchestral music)

107
00:12:13,074 --> 00:12:15,864
Mademoiselle, am I not a pathetic sight?

108
00:12:16,954 --> 00:12:18,164
Did you ever imagine the depths

109
00:12:18,164 --> 00:12:19,784
to which a boy could sink?

110
00:12:20,904 --> 00:12:21,624
I...

111
00:12:21,624 --> 00:12:26,084
(coughs) Come, a few coins.

112
00:12:26,834 --> 00:12:28,214
Ease your conscience.

113
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:30,584
I can use the money and I'm sure

114
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:32,504
it'll make you feel so much better.

115
00:12:33,414 --> 00:12:34,538
I...

116
00:12:36,264 --> 00:12:37,384
All right.

117
00:12:42,434 --> 00:12:43,427
There.

118
00:12:43,427 --> 00:12:45,217
I sure you feel so much better.

119
00:12:53,484 --> 00:12:54,854
Good crowd tonight.

120
00:12:56,154 --> 00:12:57,244
Wonderful.

121
00:12:58,204 --> 00:13:00,284
Come, positions, everyone!

122
00:13:01,534 --> 00:13:02,744
Hey, where's Vigo?

123
00:13:03,374 --> 00:13:04,784
Last minute repairs.

124
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:07,124
Ah, it's two minutes
before curtain time.

125
00:13:07,124 --> 00:13:08,464
He's not a professional.

126
00:13:08,464 --> 00:13:10,674
Please, positions.

127
00:13:16,634 --> 00:13:18,594
Monsieur Vigo, at your convenience,

128
00:13:18,594 --> 00:13:20,304
we would like to begin.

129
00:13:20,304 --> 00:13:22,434
Yeah, I'm almost ready, Andre.

130
00:13:23,264 --> 00:13:24,764
Almost ready.

131
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,194
There, perfection.

132
00:13:36,574 --> 00:13:38,017
I'm happy for you both.

133
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:39,784
Please, take your place.

134
00:13:41,694 --> 00:13:43,074
You worry too much, Andre.

135
00:13:43,074 --> 00:13:44,824
It is fashionable to be late.

136
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:48,614
Fashionable for the
audience, not the production.

137
00:13:49,084 --> 00:13:50,326
Hurry, let's go!

138
00:13:57,214 --> 00:13:58,514
All in position?

139
00:13:59,134 --> 00:14:00,054
Good.

140
00:14:01,554 --> 00:14:06,354
(dramatic violin music)

141
00:14:08,274 --> 00:14:10,524
(drum rolling)

142
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,694
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like

143
00:14:16,694 --> 00:14:18,864
to welcome you to the real world.

144
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:22,864
A world of magic, of
gods, and of monsters.

145
00:14:23,824 --> 00:14:27,204
Here, all familiar illusion
will be swept away.

146
00:14:27,777 --> 00:14:30,704
Here, all things become one...

147
00:14:31,794 --> 00:14:33,714
Of terror and wonder.

148
00:14:34,714 --> 00:14:36,714
Heaven and Hell.

149
00:14:38,214 --> 00:14:40,794
Fear and desire.

150
00:14:41,844 --> 00:14:44,344
I give you The Theatre Magique,

151
00:14:44,344 --> 00:14:46,974
where all things are possible.

152
00:15:04,784 --> 00:15:09,784
(classical piano music)

153
00:15:14,864 --> 00:15:16,574
[Latour] With this one eye of mine,

154
00:15:18,104 --> 00:15:20,304
I can see better than any other two.

155
00:15:26,554 --> 00:15:28,304
[Duval] If one is better than two,

156
00:15:28,304 --> 00:15:31,644
then perhaps none would
be better than one.

157
00:15:36,724 --> 00:15:39,694
[Andre] What strange and
frightening place is this?

158
00:15:42,404 --> 00:15:44,074
[Vigo] Don't you know, my friend?

159
00:15:45,214 --> 00:15:49,614
[Valentin] Smell the sulfur,
feel the heat of the flames.

160
00:15:51,404 --> 00:15:54,044
[Andre] We could be
nowhere else but Hell.

161
00:15:55,202 --> 00:15:58,124
[Latour] Everywhere is
Hell, for we are the damned.

162
00:16:00,044 --> 00:16:05,044
(eerie violin music)

163
00:16:10,104 --> 00:16:12,184
(horses clomping)

164
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,014
He's left the nest.

165
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:51,554
Go, quickly, follow him.

166
00:16:52,334 --> 00:16:53,564
Follow him.

167
00:16:53,564 --> 00:16:55,104
Follow him.

168
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:59,104
Approach him from behind.

169
00:16:59,524 --> 00:17:01,354
Do not let him suspect.

170
00:17:02,024 --> 00:17:04,194
Then kill him.

171
00:17:05,114 --> 00:17:09,034
Afterwards, there will be more money.

172
00:17:11,954 --> 00:17:13,244
Don't you worry, sir.

173
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:15,294
You can depend on us.

174
00:17:16,164 --> 00:17:17,704
Do not fail!

175
00:17:18,084 --> 00:17:19,334
Do not fail.

176
00:17:19,334 --> 00:17:21,004
Do not fail.

177
00:17:21,504 --> 00:17:22,584
We won't.

178
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:24,174
We won't.

179
00:17:29,094 --> 00:17:30,634
[Andre] Why do we stay here?

180
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:31,844
Let us escape.

181
00:17:34,184 --> 00:17:36,684
[Vigo] There is no escape from fate.

182
00:17:37,314 --> 00:17:40,144
[Valetin] We all are
puppets dancing on a string.

183
00:17:40,484 --> 00:17:42,024
[Latour] Free will is an illusion.

184
00:17:42,847 --> 00:17:45,944
[Valentin] We can only act
at the whim of the puppeteer.

185
00:17:46,864 --> 00:17:48,727
[Andre] Then our path is clear.

186
00:17:49,324 --> 00:17:52,114
Into the fire with you
all, and with me as well,

187
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:55,124
and thus the comedy ends.

188
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:56,824
(gasps)

189
00:17:58,364 --> 00:18:00,124
(clapping)

190
00:18:04,969 --> 00:18:06,629
[Second Servant] Why do we not attack?

191
00:18:06,629 --> 00:18:08,249
Why use them?

192
00:18:08,709 --> 00:18:09,839
[First Servant] Why?

193
00:18:10,719 --> 00:18:12,309
He senses us.

194
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:15,889
He knows when we approach.

195
00:18:16,421 --> 00:18:18,099
And he has power.

196
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,439
Do you think they can kill him?

197
00:18:20,689 --> 00:18:22,819
Yeah, can they kill him?

198
00:18:23,762 --> 00:18:25,141
He is mortal.

199
00:18:25,819 --> 00:18:27,739
If he is caught unaware.

200
00:18:29,069 --> 00:18:32,949
And if not, no loss.

201
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:40,039
(dramatic orchestral music)

202
00:19:00,269 --> 00:19:02,229
(clapping)

203
00:19:20,249 --> 00:19:25,249
(suspenseful violin music)

204
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:33,299
(clapping)

205
00:19:44,269 --> 00:19:45,979
(groaning)

206
00:20:24,399 --> 00:20:26,189
Help, help!

207
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,519
Police, police!

208
00:20:29,069 --> 00:20:30,609
Let's get outta here, let's go!

209
00:20:30,609 --> 00:20:31,739
Police!

210
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:35,699
Oh dear, oh no.

211
00:20:40,909 --> 00:20:41,909
Help!

212
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:43,409
Help!

213
00:20:45,822 --> 00:20:47,129
Open the door!

214
00:20:47,699 --> 00:20:49,209
Open the door please!

215
00:20:49,662 --> 00:20:51,589
Please help, a man's been attacked!

216
00:21:06,219 --> 00:21:08,593
(conversing in French)

217
00:21:14,069 --> 00:21:16,279
What did they say, what
are they going to do?

218
00:21:16,529 --> 00:21:17,359
To do?

219
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,839
Well since there's neither a bribe nor

220
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:20,489
a loose morale mademoiselle attached to

221
00:21:20,489 --> 00:21:22,869
the complaint, I suspect
they'll do nothing.

222
00:21:25,579 --> 00:21:26,749
I'm afraid he's right, these

223
00:21:26,749 --> 00:21:28,419
sort of things are rather common.

224
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:31,549
I wanted to thank you for helping.

225
00:21:32,162 --> 00:21:33,719
It was my pleasure.

226
00:21:34,339 --> 00:21:35,379
The old man.

227
00:21:36,689 --> 00:21:37,579
Well?

228
00:21:37,579 --> 00:21:39,759
If he wakes in the next
hour, he should recover.

229
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:41,719
If he doesn't, he probably won't.

230
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:43,259
But why would they want to kill him?

231
00:21:44,379 --> 00:21:46,509
Some men don't need a reason.

232
00:21:48,229 --> 00:21:50,819
Mademoiselle, can we escort you home?

233
00:21:51,399 --> 00:21:54,309
Oh, no, no, no thank you.

234
00:21:56,069 --> 00:21:58,779
Valentin, get her a carriage.

235
00:22:04,749 --> 00:22:06,289
I live to serve.

236
00:22:10,379 --> 00:22:12,209
I saw you in the theatre.

237
00:22:12,669 --> 00:22:14,049
And I saw you.

238
00:22:15,049 --> 00:22:18,429
That is, of course I saw you.

239
00:22:20,349 --> 00:22:22,099
Have you been doing this for long?

240
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,519
The puppets, I mean.

241
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:24,962
All my life.

242
00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:26,479
Really?

243
00:22:28,189 --> 00:22:30,219
Well it was very nice to meet you.

244
00:22:30,859 --> 00:22:33,319
Obviously, the circumstances...

245
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:35,739
The circumstances
could've been better, yes.

246
00:22:36,729 --> 00:22:38,109
Yes, you have to forgive me, this

247
00:22:38,109 --> 00:22:40,279
sort of thing doesn't
happen to me very often.

248
00:22:40,619 --> 00:22:42,239
Well never, in fact.

249
00:22:42,489 --> 00:22:43,949
With the men in the alley.

250
00:22:43,949 --> 00:22:46,409
You did very well for your first time.

251
00:22:47,619 --> 00:22:49,903
Her majesty's carriage awaits.

252
00:22:50,364 --> 00:22:53,799
Yes, I really should, my father...

253
00:22:55,379 --> 00:22:57,509
That is, I should be going.

254
00:22:58,089 --> 00:22:59,179
Goodnight.

255
00:22:59,299 --> 00:23:00,459
Good evening.

256
00:23:02,179 --> 00:23:03,549
Did you enjoy the show?

257
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:07,519
Oh, it was interesting.

258
00:23:07,849 --> 00:23:10,229
Now there's a diplomatic answer.

259
00:23:12,969 --> 00:23:14,569
I liked it very much.

260
00:23:15,149 --> 00:23:17,069
Then come again, please.

261
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:19,489
I'll, I'll try.

262
00:23:20,109 --> 00:23:21,489
Good evening, monsieur.

263
00:23:21,819 --> 00:23:22,739
Andre.

264
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:24,109
Andre.

265
00:23:24,739 --> 00:23:25,779
Goodnight.

266
00:23:27,569 --> 00:23:28,659
Goodnight.

267
00:23:31,824 --> 00:23:33,362
Oh Andre!

268
00:23:33,362 --> 00:23:34,829
Shut it.
(laughing)

269
00:23:37,879 --> 00:23:39,709
[First Servant] Afzel still lives.

270
00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:41,499
[Second Servant] He still lives.

271
00:23:41,889 --> 00:23:45,083
[First Servant] I sense
him, he is weaker at least.

272
00:23:45,969 --> 00:23:48,009
Weaker, but now what?

273
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,479
Now what?

274
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:51,842
It will be harder now.

275
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:54,809
He has known of us from the beginning.

276
00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:56,819
He senses us.

277
00:23:57,319 --> 00:23:58,939
He waits for us.

278
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:03,819
But we must choose the time
and the place to strike.

279
00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:07,079
We cannot fall no more.

280
00:24:07,699 --> 00:24:08,999
(mumble).

281
00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:15,789
(dramatic bass music)

282
00:24:33,229 --> 00:24:34,439
You should try to attract a more

283
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:36,389
working class (mumble), Andre.

284
00:24:36,689 --> 00:24:37,819
They're always more generous to

285
00:24:37,819 --> 00:24:40,189
poor, helpless unfortunates like me.

286
00:24:40,739 --> 00:24:42,919
These rich bastards, squeezing a

287
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:46,319
sous out of them is like real work.

288
00:24:47,199 --> 00:24:48,779
I'll see what I can do for you.

289
00:24:49,199 --> 00:24:51,619
Make some girl puppets, naked ones.

290
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:54,919
Maybe a sort of puppet (mumble).

291
00:24:55,419 --> 00:24:56,669
(laughing)

292
00:24:56,669 --> 00:24:58,499
(coughing)

293
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:03,339
I thought you just
coughed for your customers.

294
00:25:03,339 --> 00:25:04,969
Is it real now?

295
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:08,582
To tell you the truth,
I'm not sure myself.

296
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:25,779
You're both a gentleman
and a scholar, Andre.

297
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:27,449
I'm neither.

298
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:31,699
Goodnight.

299
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:52,969
I suppose you'll have to do.

300
00:25:53,429 --> 00:25:54,849
Oh, you're awake.

301
00:25:55,269 --> 00:25:57,099
How are you feeling, you
were attacked by some...

302
00:25:57,099 --> 00:25:59,059
I know what happened to me.

303
00:25:59,479 --> 00:26:01,319
Is there anybody you'd
like me to send for?

304
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:03,189
Family, friends?

305
00:26:03,899 --> 00:26:06,149
I've had no living relatives

306
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:10,239
for almost 2,900 years.

307
00:26:12,329 --> 00:26:13,579
Oh, I see.

308
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:16,749
Put that thing down and come over here.

309
00:26:25,879 --> 00:26:26,879
Sit.

310
00:26:28,549 --> 00:26:32,009
Listen carefully and do not interrupt.

311
00:26:36,349 --> 00:26:40,019
My name is Afzel, I am a sorcerer.

312
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:44,529
Born in Egypt some 3,000 years ago,

313
00:26:44,529 --> 00:26:47,819
but now I'm being pursued by the

314
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:51,029
servants of an elder god named Sutekh.

315
00:26:51,949 --> 00:26:56,449
They pursue me because I
stole the secret of life.

316
00:26:57,369 --> 00:27:00,239
The power to place the soul of

317
00:27:00,239 --> 00:27:02,952
a man inside a dead thing...

318
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,499
And make it live.

319
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:13,639
But now I am dying.

320
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:20,599
I cannot be saved, but
the secret must be saved.

321
00:27:22,769 --> 00:27:26,893
The elder gods bide their time.

322
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:30,392
When they rise 100 years from now,

323
00:27:30,392 --> 00:27:33,659
a thousand, nothing but the secret

324
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:35,869
of life may save humankind, I will

325
00:27:35,869 --> 00:27:40,039
teach it to you, do you understand?

326
00:27:41,249 --> 00:27:43,709
Yeah, I see, I understand.

327
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,909
You're a 3,000 year
old sorcerer from Egypt

328
00:27:46,909 --> 00:27:51,379
and you want to teach
me the secret of life?

329
00:27:54,332 --> 00:27:56,639
But I think you should rest.

330
00:27:56,962 --> 00:27:58,173
There will be plenty of time for

331
00:27:58,173 --> 00:27:59,349
that tomorrow, don't you think,

332
00:27:59,349 --> 00:28:01,384
I mean after 3,000 years, what
(speaking foreign language)

333
00:28:01,384 --> 00:28:03,099
would one more night matter?

334
00:28:15,233 --> 00:28:18,039
Is the old man mad?

335
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:23,039
Or is the young man a fool?

336
00:28:29,129 --> 00:28:31,129
Look over there, young man.

337
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:37,599
(dramatic sting)

338
00:28:53,029 --> 00:28:55,029
This is the secret of life?

339
00:28:57,329 --> 00:29:01,249
They do not live, I use
them as you do, as puppets.

340
00:29:01,659 --> 00:29:03,789
Now they are mere shells.

341
00:29:04,569 --> 00:29:08,499
The will that drives them is mine.

342
00:29:19,889 --> 00:29:23,589
The secret of life is very different.

343
00:29:24,589 --> 00:29:26,849
Far more precious.

344
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:31,979
We can make your puppets truly

345
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:36,609
live as men live, with souls and wills.

346
00:29:38,649 --> 00:29:40,159
What are they doing?

347
00:29:41,289 --> 00:29:44,959
Carving signs of
protection for your doors.

348
00:29:45,829 --> 00:29:48,789
It will make it harder for my enemies...

349
00:29:49,749 --> 00:29:51,079
To find me.

350
00:30:03,089 --> 00:30:05,019
(owl hooting)

351
00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:10,889
Sometimes I think I must be going mad.

352
00:30:12,609 --> 00:30:13,529
What?

353
00:30:13,989 --> 00:30:15,359
What, I give you an opening like that

354
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:17,279
and you don't take advantage of it?

355
00:30:33,619 --> 00:30:35,009
Bring him inside.

356
00:30:38,709 --> 00:30:39,299
He's...

357
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:42,179
Dead, yes I know, it's fortunate for us.

358
00:30:42,639 --> 00:30:44,269
Bodies are easier to find in the

359
00:30:44,269 --> 00:30:47,139
streets of Cairo than
in the streets of Paris.

360
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:50,439
What are you talking about?

361
00:30:52,772 --> 00:30:55,029
Did you think it was enough merely

362
00:30:55,029 --> 00:30:56,939
to teach you theory?

363
00:30:57,649 --> 00:30:59,659
To be a master, you must practice

364
00:30:59,659 --> 00:31:01,399
what you have learned.

365
00:31:01,779 --> 00:31:04,489
Think of it as a gift, sir, a rebirth

366
00:31:04,489 --> 00:31:06,079
if that makes it easier for you,

367
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:07,749
but in the name of everything holy,

368
00:31:07,749 --> 00:31:09,209
please get him inside before

369
00:31:09,209 --> 00:31:11,499
somebody walks by, quickly!

370
00:31:13,992 --> 00:31:18,992
(dramatic flute music)

371
00:31:23,082 --> 00:31:24,139
Take it.

372
00:31:25,042 --> 00:31:27,519
Tool of the art, I give it to you.

373
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,679
Careful.

374
00:31:40,739 --> 00:31:42,029
(magical chime)

375
00:31:59,719 --> 00:32:01,663
The ring does not matter.

376
00:32:01,969 --> 00:32:03,832
It has no special power.

377
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:07,349
It is merely a tool, the
same is true with the fluid.

378
00:32:08,139 --> 00:32:11,019
For our magic, it serves merely

379
00:32:11,019 --> 00:32:14,479
as a bridge for the lifeforce.

380
00:32:15,149 --> 00:32:16,769
Your soul.

381
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:19,779
Now...

382
00:32:33,469 --> 00:32:35,169
Now the words.

383
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:44,212
(speaking foreign language)

384
00:32:52,769 --> 00:32:57,769
(dramatic bass music)

385
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:08,989
There, see?

386
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:21,339
See?

387
00:33:39,979 --> 00:33:42,109
It cannot speak, of course.

388
00:33:42,933 --> 00:33:44,279
But it lives.

389
00:33:44,949 --> 00:33:46,102
It lives?

390
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:58,419
Do you know me?

391
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:04,719
Do you know what I have done?

392
00:34:09,049 --> 00:34:10,629
Have I harmed you?

393
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:18,349
I need a little rest.

394
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:23,319
Afzel!

395
00:34:23,319 --> 00:34:24,189
What?

396
00:34:24,189 --> 00:34:25,471
Are you all right?

397
00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:30,152
No, I'm dying, I told you that before.

398
00:34:30,747 --> 00:34:34,239
But not right this moment.

399
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:36,529
But soon.

400
00:34:41,289 --> 00:34:42,499
One day.

401
00:34:43,709 --> 00:34:44,952
No more.

402
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:47,589
Is there anything I can do?

403
00:34:48,709 --> 00:34:49,679
Yes.

404
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,559
The gift I have given you is
the most precious in the world.

405
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:58,149
Down through the centuries, armies have

406
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:01,609
fought and died for it.

407
00:35:04,509 --> 00:35:06,269
Do not waste it.

408
00:35:09,029 --> 00:35:14,029
(dramatic flute music)

409
00:35:57,449 --> 00:35:58,829
Where are you?

410
00:36:00,989 --> 00:36:02,539
Where have you gone?

411
00:36:04,709 --> 00:36:07,169
Please come back, please!

412
00:36:21,469 --> 00:36:22,899
Can you hear me?

413
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:25,149
Where are you hiding?

414
00:36:29,013 --> 00:36:30,769
I don't mean to hurt you.

415
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:37,529
Please, stop it.

416
00:36:46,492 --> 00:36:47,629
Come back.

417
00:36:48,129 --> 00:36:49,879
Please come back!

418
00:37:08,433 --> 00:37:09,819
(knocking)

419
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:13,649
(whispers in French)

420
00:37:31,465 --> 00:37:32,885
Oh, it's...

421
00:37:33,175 --> 00:37:33,885
Ilsa.

422
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:37,878
I hope I, well I can
see I didn't wake you.

423
00:37:37,878 --> 00:37:39,175
Oh no, no.

424
00:37:39,378 --> 00:37:40,345
May I come in?

425
00:37:41,055 --> 00:37:43,595
Oh please, (mumble).

426
00:37:44,588 --> 00:37:47,605
I hope you don't mind
my coming, I wanted to...

427
00:37:49,765 --> 00:37:51,395
Well I would have come to the performance,

428
00:37:51,395 --> 00:37:53,445
but sometimes it's rather difficult

429
00:37:53,445 --> 00:37:55,865
for me to get away from home.

430
00:37:56,605 --> 00:37:58,115
No, of course, I'm glad you came,

431
00:37:58,115 --> 00:37:59,445
but you see...

432
00:37:59,855 --> 00:38:01,035
How is he?

433
00:38:01,955 --> 00:38:03,235
How is...

434
00:38:03,488 --> 00:38:04,495
I'm sorry?

435
00:38:04,819 --> 00:38:06,875
That poor old man, is he any better?

436
00:38:06,875 --> 00:38:09,045
Oh, he's fine.

437
00:38:09,045 --> 00:38:11,795
Oh that's good, I was rather worried.

438
00:38:13,045 --> 00:38:16,539
He is, like I said,
asleep now of course.

439
00:38:18,725 --> 00:38:21,635
I, I have a confession to make.

440
00:38:22,635 --> 00:38:24,185
What, a confession?

441
00:38:24,465 --> 00:38:25,315
Yes.

442
00:38:26,725 --> 00:38:29,685
I didn't come only to
ask about the old man,

443
00:38:29,685 --> 00:38:32,445
I came to see you.

444
00:38:33,445 --> 00:38:34,935
(mumble) me?

445
00:38:35,525 --> 00:38:37,655
Yes, I'm sure that's rather shocking,

446
00:38:37,655 --> 00:38:39,695
a young girl coming out in the middle

447
00:38:39,695 --> 00:38:42,495
of the night to meet
with a virtual stranger.

448
00:38:43,485 --> 00:38:44,825
Or perhaps not.

449
00:38:45,745 --> 00:38:47,585
After all, you are in the theatre.

450
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,495
I won't find it shocking at all,

451
00:38:49,495 --> 00:38:51,085
I'm very glad you came.

452
00:38:52,365 --> 00:38:54,465
But I'm afraid you'll have to go.

453
00:38:55,885 --> 00:38:56,925
I'm sorry?

454
00:38:57,675 --> 00:39:00,135
Yes, it's late you
see, and I'm very busy.

455
00:39:02,845 --> 00:39:04,045
I see.

456
00:39:04,515 --> 00:39:07,265
I must seem like a bit of a fool to you.

457
00:39:07,855 --> 00:39:09,635
Please, it's not that, it's...

458
00:39:10,305 --> 00:39:12,065
The old man is asleep.

459
00:39:12,645 --> 00:39:15,605
Yes, I seem like a bit of a fool myself.

460
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:18,865
You don't understand.

461
00:39:19,235 --> 00:39:20,905
No really, there's
nothing to understand,

462
00:39:20,905 --> 00:39:22,785
you certainly owe me no explanation,

463
00:39:22,785 --> 00:39:24,825
we really don't know each other at all,

464
00:39:24,825 --> 00:39:27,115
really, I'm sure a man such as yourself,

465
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:29,245
you have many willing women and

466
00:39:29,245 --> 00:39:32,739
I can hardly compare with their expertise.

467
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:35,045
Please listen to me.

468
00:39:35,585 --> 00:39:38,835
I can't explain, but I
am very glad you came.

469
00:39:39,295 --> 00:39:40,715
(glass shattering)

470
00:39:48,645 --> 00:39:49,765
[Ilsa] No, don't!

471
00:39:50,145 --> 00:39:51,675
No, no, don't!

472
00:39:52,225 --> 00:39:53,645
Keep your hands off me!

473
00:39:56,195 --> 00:39:57,355
Oh, you.

474
00:40:01,308 --> 00:40:03,535
You have no right to do this!

475
00:40:04,728 --> 00:40:07,488
Please, mademoiselle, no scenes.

476
00:40:08,495 --> 00:40:09,568
You'll pay for this.

477
00:40:09,568 --> 00:40:12,665
Oh mademoiselle, I
have already been paid.

478
00:40:15,085 --> 00:40:16,715
Keep your hands off her!

479
00:40:16,908 --> 00:40:18,375
You are not going to put up a

480
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:20,675
struggle are you, mademoiselle?

481
00:40:22,305 --> 00:40:24,675
Please take the mademoiselle.

482
00:40:35,722 --> 00:40:38,225
[Ilsa] I hope you
don't expect an apology.

483
00:40:38,775 --> 00:40:40,275
I am not sorry!

484
00:40:40,655 --> 00:40:42,065
I'm not a child anymore and you had

485
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:45,995
no right to send this,
this watchdog of yours!

486
00:40:46,285 --> 00:40:47,955
Oh, mademoiselle.

487
00:40:49,075 --> 00:40:50,665
Please, leave us.

488
00:40:50,995 --> 00:40:51,955
Yes sir.

489
00:41:00,425 --> 00:41:04,595
Ilsa, I'm extremely disappointed in you.

490
00:41:05,168 --> 00:41:07,345
If you do not wish to
be treated like a child,

491
00:41:07,345 --> 00:41:09,015
you shouldn't behave like one.

492
00:41:09,975 --> 00:41:12,145
Clearly you still have
some growing up to do

493
00:41:12,145 --> 00:41:15,355
and I'm afraid Paris is
not the place to do it.

494
00:41:16,355 --> 00:41:17,678
At the end of the week I'm going

495
00:41:17,678 --> 00:41:19,445
to return you to Geneva.

496
00:41:20,815 --> 00:41:21,655
Father...

497
00:41:21,655 --> 00:41:24,025
In the meantime, of course, you

498
00:41:24,025 --> 00:41:26,729
will not be permitted
to leave the embassy.

499
00:41:27,995 --> 00:41:30,115
Father, I swear to you...

500
00:41:30,115 --> 00:41:32,575
I'm sorry, Ilsa, my mind is made up.

501
00:41:33,485 --> 00:41:34,705
Good evening.

502
00:41:38,755 --> 00:41:39,755
Father!

503
00:41:40,755 --> 00:41:42,925
Good evening.

504
00:41:53,725 --> 00:41:54,765
(door slams)

505
00:41:56,255 --> 00:41:57,645
(bell rings)

506
00:42:04,405 --> 00:42:05,615
Who are you?

507
00:42:06,775 --> 00:42:08,405
Why are you doing this?

508
00:42:11,285 --> 00:42:14,035
Excuse me, young man,
but I'm rather tired.

509
00:42:14,405 --> 00:42:16,285
It is past my bedtime.

510
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:25,835
I bid you goodnight
and good lesson, clown.

511
00:42:42,475 --> 00:42:43,929
(dramatic sting)

512
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:48,735
[First Servant] I feel him.

513
00:42:48,735 --> 00:42:50,018
[Second Servant] Feel him!

514
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:51,825
He is weak.

515
00:42:52,365 --> 00:42:53,865
And he is close.

516
00:42:55,535 --> 00:42:57,205
It is time to act.

517
00:42:57,665 --> 00:42:59,455
Time to kill.

518
00:43:00,325 --> 00:43:01,795
To kill.

519
00:43:01,795 --> 00:43:03,035
To kill.

520
00:43:03,327 --> 00:43:04,408
Come.

521
00:43:11,409 --> 00:43:16,409
(dramatic violin music)

522
00:43:58,225 --> 00:44:00,355
Oh, Valentin, is the door repaired?

523
00:44:00,355 --> 00:44:03,025
Yes, my skills were able to

524
00:44:03,025 --> 00:44:05,515
encompass this heroic enterprise.

525
00:44:05,895 --> 00:44:07,315
(glass shatters)

526
00:44:09,315 --> 00:44:10,815
(dramatic sting)

527
00:44:28,125 --> 00:44:29,385
(slow motion) Hey, what the devil

528
00:44:29,385 --> 00:44:31,675
do you think you are doing?

529
00:44:32,385 --> 00:44:34,755
(otherworldly sounds)

530
00:44:54,905 --> 00:44:56,785
(groaning)

531
00:45:50,135 --> 00:45:52,045
(grunting)

532
00:45:53,118 --> 00:45:58,118
(dramatic music)

533
00:45:59,595 --> 00:46:01,555
(otherworldly sounds)

534
00:46:30,295 --> 00:46:32,295
(gunshots)

535
00:46:46,805 --> 00:46:49,223
(otherworldly sounds)

536
00:47:09,155 --> 00:47:12,835
At last, the rats have
come for the (mumble).

537
00:47:15,705 --> 00:47:17,505
You are weak now, thief.

538
00:47:18,997 --> 00:47:22,015
Your powers cannot match ours.

539
00:47:22,425 --> 00:47:23,925
You must die, thief.

540
00:47:24,225 --> 00:47:25,965
You must die, thief.

541
00:47:27,008 --> 00:47:27,975
Yes.

542
00:47:28,805 --> 00:47:30,048
I will die.

543
00:47:31,475 --> 00:47:33,555
But not at your hands.

544
00:47:34,645 --> 00:47:38,775
Sutekh will not lay claim to my death.

545
00:47:40,325 --> 00:47:43,075
(otherworldly sounds)

546
00:47:58,675 --> 00:48:00,215
I think he's dead.

547
00:48:04,175 --> 00:48:05,925
All praise to Sutekh!

548
00:48:06,435 --> 00:48:08,225
All praise to Sutekh!

549
00:48:08,515 --> 00:48:10,555
All praise to Sutekh!

550
00:48:20,269 --> 00:48:22,445
(horses clomping)

551
00:48:38,715 --> 00:48:43,715
(dramatic bass music)

552
00:48:50,378 --> 00:48:51,515
Oh my God.

553
00:48:52,718 --> 00:48:54,638
(music intensifies)

554
00:50:04,045 --> 00:50:05,795
I'm sorry, my friends.

555
00:50:07,135 --> 00:50:08,845
I'm sorry I failed you.

556
00:50:09,845 --> 00:50:11,725
And I'm sorry that I need your help.

557
00:50:13,685 --> 00:50:15,338
Vengeance may not be the most noble

558
00:50:15,338 --> 00:50:20,338
reason for living, but
for now, it is all I have.

559
00:50:43,335 --> 00:50:45,135
(train bell ringing)

560
00:50:49,795 --> 00:50:51,088
[Second Servant] It is he.

561
00:50:51,675 --> 00:50:52,845
[Third Servant] It is he.

562
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:56,885
No, it is another.

563
00:51:09,575 --> 00:51:10,945
That thief Afzel has given the

564
00:51:10,945 --> 00:51:13,065
secret of life to another.

565
00:51:25,045 --> 00:51:27,835
Then another must die.

566
00:51:27,835 --> 00:51:29,205
Another must die.

567
00:51:36,185 --> 00:51:37,295
Come.

568
00:51:44,025 --> 00:51:49,025
(dramatic horn music)

569
00:52:18,895 --> 00:52:22,605
(speaking foreign language)

570
00:53:38,925 --> 00:53:40,475
Oh, my friend.

571
00:53:41,185 --> 00:53:42,595
You've returned.

572
00:53:44,185 --> 00:53:46,265
You're not frightened anymore?

573
00:53:48,775 --> 00:53:50,605
I wish I wasn't.

574
00:53:55,275 --> 00:53:56,485
Afzel?

575
00:53:58,825 --> 00:54:00,155
Oh, I see.

576
00:54:00,735 --> 00:54:02,075
Not Afzel.

577
00:54:03,695 --> 00:54:05,625
Six Shooter then.

578
00:54:09,165 --> 00:54:10,415
And Blade.

579
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:20,765
Drill Sergeant.

580
00:54:26,265 --> 00:54:27,725
Doctor Death.

581
00:54:32,395 --> 00:54:34,105
Cyclops.

582
00:54:39,865 --> 00:54:42,035
And no longer my master?

583
00:54:44,945 --> 00:54:46,535
Will you follow me?

584
00:54:58,255 --> 00:55:00,965
Then we shall be avengers.

585
00:55:04,418 --> 00:55:08,515
We shall be destroyers of evil.

586
00:55:16,351 --> 00:55:17,815
It is no longer safe and there

587
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:20,518
will be too many
questions I cannot answer.

588
00:55:23,205 --> 00:55:24,745
But I cannot come face to face

589
00:55:24,745 --> 00:55:26,995
with your killers without protection.

590
00:55:27,245 --> 00:55:28,125
Ah!

591
00:55:31,835 --> 00:55:34,295
When Blade here is
finished, we will leave.

592
00:55:34,835 --> 00:55:36,375
These devils can't fly, and if they're

593
00:55:36,375 --> 00:55:37,885
returning to Egypt, there aren't

594
00:55:37,885 --> 00:55:39,845
too many ways for them to go.

595
00:55:40,175 --> 00:55:43,305
We will find them, I promise you.

596
00:55:49,175 --> 00:55:50,298
Finished?

597
00:55:55,895 --> 00:55:57,945
Lacking in amenities, I fear.

598
00:55:59,115 --> 00:56:04,115
But by far the least conspicuous
means of transportation.

599
00:56:19,135 --> 00:56:20,845
You've come looking for me.

600
00:56:22,055 --> 00:56:23,038
Die!

601
00:56:23,805 --> 00:56:26,225
(otherworldly sounds)
(groaning)

602
00:56:37,145 --> 00:56:39,098
Not so easy to kill me.

603
00:56:43,445 --> 00:56:45,695
Die on your knees, thief!

604
00:56:46,195 --> 00:56:48,955
Bow down before the god you mock!

605
00:56:54,455 --> 00:56:57,045
I bow down to nothing evil!

606
00:57:02,175 --> 00:57:03,885
(groaning)

607
00:57:06,805 --> 00:57:08,918
Not so easy to kill.

608
00:57:09,215 --> 00:57:10,095
Kill!

609
00:57:10,925 --> 00:57:15,925
(suspenseful music)

610
00:57:25,021 --> 00:57:26,645
(groaning)

611
00:58:48,905 --> 00:58:50,615
(gunshots)

612
00:59:10,095 --> 00:59:12,545
I think we will leave Paris, my friends.

613
00:59:14,048 --> 00:59:16,305
There's nothing more for us here now.

614
00:59:17,338 --> 00:59:18,588
Nothing more.

615
00:59:35,915 --> 00:59:39,165
[Sutekh] Rise, obey!

616
00:59:39,655 --> 00:59:41,665
Live again!

617
00:59:58,975 --> 01:00:02,885
That one is useless, he
cannot be brought back again.

618
01:00:03,935 --> 01:00:08,935
Mighty one, the thief Afzel is dead.

619
01:00:09,685 --> 01:00:11,485
[Sutekh] Not (mumble)
the secret of life.

620
01:00:11,485 --> 01:00:14,115
Make no excuses, you have failed me.

621
01:00:14,405 --> 01:00:15,689
We have failed.

622
01:00:17,455 --> 01:00:21,625
Oh most holy and terrible one, Sutekh,

623
01:00:21,625 --> 01:00:25,745
whose heart is the very blackness of time.

624
01:00:26,745 --> 01:00:28,175
I beg you.

625
01:00:29,335 --> 01:00:33,095
Give us the power to do your will.

626
01:00:33,715 --> 01:00:36,095
To kill this thief.

627
01:00:44,758 --> 01:00:45,935
[Sutekh] Take this power, but

628
01:00:45,935 --> 01:00:48,235
do not use it too much.

629
01:00:51,155 --> 01:00:53,188
All praise to Sutekh!

630
01:00:53,735 --> 01:00:55,865
[Second Servant] All praise to Sutekh!

631
01:01:01,745 --> 01:01:06,745
(dramatic violin music)

632
01:01:45,835 --> 01:01:47,455
One he loves.

633
01:01:51,888 --> 01:01:53,747
[Ilsa] Dear Monsieur Toulon,

634
01:01:54,595 --> 01:01:56,505
please accept my most profound apologies

635
01:01:56,505 --> 01:01:58,885
for any inconvenience and...

636
01:02:00,385 --> 01:02:02,935
Inconvenience, are you mad?

637
01:02:04,895 --> 01:02:06,185
Dear Andre.

638
01:02:07,605 --> 01:02:09,145
Dearest Andre.

639
01:02:10,605 --> 01:02:13,815
My dear phantom whom I
shall never see again.

640
01:02:22,705 --> 01:02:25,835
Mademoiselle, may I be of some service?

641
01:02:26,695 --> 01:02:28,455
No, no thank you.

642
01:02:28,795 --> 01:02:30,335
Mademoiselle should be pleased to know

643
01:02:30,335 --> 01:02:32,335
that when I retire, one of my most able

644
01:02:32,335 --> 01:02:34,505
assistants will take my place.

645
01:02:35,595 --> 01:02:36,595
I see.

646
01:02:37,135 --> 01:02:38,499
So in the event that mademoiselle

647
01:02:38,499 --> 01:02:41,725
requires any assistance, someone

648
01:02:41,725 --> 01:02:44,225
would be available at all times.

649
01:02:45,265 --> 01:02:46,605
You are so kind.

650
01:02:46,605 --> 01:02:48,355
Hardly kind, mademoiselle.

651
01:02:48,725 --> 01:02:50,185
Merely efficient.

652
01:02:50,485 --> 01:02:51,645
Good evening.

653
01:02:52,389 --> 01:02:54,275
Yes, good evening.

654
01:03:00,648 --> 01:03:05,648
(dramatic bass music)

655
01:03:06,375 --> 01:03:08,569
(horses clomping)

656
01:03:27,927 --> 01:03:29,175
She is here?

657
01:03:32,065 --> 01:03:34,945
You have a message for
the ambassador's daughter?

658
01:03:35,475 --> 01:03:37,945
A message, yes.

659
01:03:38,275 --> 01:03:39,575
Where is she?

660
01:03:40,115 --> 01:03:41,325
Where is she?

661
01:03:41,695 --> 01:03:44,115
Asleep in her room in
the West Wing, I presume.

662
01:03:44,675 --> 01:03:45,785
Leave it here.

663
01:03:46,205 --> 01:03:47,375
Leave it?

664
01:03:48,455 --> 01:03:50,318
You said you had a message.

665
01:03:50,495 --> 01:03:51,585
Yes.

666
01:03:53,455 --> 01:03:55,255
Well what is it?

667
01:03:57,545 --> 01:03:58,585
Die.

668
01:03:58,965 --> 01:04:01,555
(otherworldly sounds)
(groaning)

669
01:04:19,195 --> 01:04:20,445
Who are you?

670
01:04:20,655 --> 01:04:22,075
What do you want here?

671
01:04:23,615 --> 01:04:24,745
Sleep.

672
01:04:25,075 --> 01:04:27,155
(otherworldly sounds)

673
01:04:30,035 --> 01:04:31,165
Take her.

674
01:04:37,505 --> 01:04:39,795
(music intensifies)

675
01:04:50,555 --> 01:04:51,759
You, stay!

676
01:04:53,135 --> 01:04:54,105
Die.

677
01:04:54,475 --> 01:04:56,429
(otherworldly sounds)

678
01:05:03,235 --> 01:05:06,785
Of what use is she to
us if he does not know?

679
01:05:06,938 --> 01:05:08,245
He will know.

680
01:05:08,615 --> 01:05:11,529
I will send him the
dream and he will know.

681
01:05:12,205 --> 01:05:14,045
But how can you send him a dream

682
01:05:14,045 --> 01:05:16,375
if we do not know where he is?

683
01:05:17,625 --> 01:05:20,005
By the power of Sutekh, all who

684
01:05:20,005 --> 01:05:22,425
sleep and dream in the city tonight

685
01:05:22,425 --> 01:05:25,425
will have the same nightmare.

686
01:05:26,515 --> 01:05:30,925
But one will know that it
is more than a nightmare.

687
01:05:31,725 --> 01:05:33,475
And he will come to us.

688
01:05:49,188 --> 01:05:52,035
Your life for hers, (mumble).

689
01:05:52,625 --> 01:05:54,375
Come to us all.

690
01:06:20,445 --> 01:06:22,985
I have a ticket on the
morning train to Calais.

691
01:06:22,985 --> 01:06:23,905
Yes?

692
01:06:24,435 --> 01:06:26,405
Is there any other
train leaving tonight?

693
01:06:27,785 --> 01:06:29,365
Well not to the...

694
01:06:29,365 --> 01:06:30,898
Anywhere, please!

695
01:06:32,365 --> 01:06:34,617
Well there's the night
train to Marseille.

696
01:06:35,035 --> 01:06:39,625
The 2:05, but you're going
to have to hurry to catch it.

697
01:06:44,635 --> 01:06:46,505
A ticket please, quickly.

698
01:06:49,635 --> 01:06:50,975
Why the change in plans?

699
01:06:50,975 --> 01:06:52,725
Give me the blasted ticket!

700
01:06:53,805 --> 01:06:54,839
Okay?

701
01:07:00,985 --> 01:07:02,185
(whistle blowing)

702
01:07:13,865 --> 01:07:15,608
(train horn blowing)

703
01:07:28,215 --> 01:07:31,015
[Conductor] Bonsoir,
welcome aboard, monsieur.

704
01:07:31,595 --> 01:07:33,675
Any seat that you would like, these here,

705
01:07:33,675 --> 01:07:35,635
any seat in the first two cars?

706
01:07:36,185 --> 01:07:37,305
Yes, thank you.

707
01:07:38,468 --> 01:07:40,355
Can you please tell me have you seen

708
01:07:40,355 --> 01:07:45,065
two strange men and a
young dark haired woman?

709
01:07:45,485 --> 01:07:47,315
[Conductor] I'm afraid I
didn't see them, monsieur.

710
01:07:47,315 --> 01:07:49,275
Perhaps you were misinformed?

711
01:07:49,525 --> 01:07:51,865
Yes, perhaps, thank you.

712
01:08:02,375 --> 01:08:04,715
(train horn blowing)

713
01:08:09,788 --> 01:08:14,788
(dramatic violin music)

714
01:08:42,495 --> 01:08:47,495
(suspenseful bass music)

715
01:09:26,415 --> 01:09:31,135
(suspenseful violin music)

716
01:10:45,285 --> 01:10:46,835
(door lock clicking)

717
01:11:16,985 --> 01:11:19,365
It was I who sent the dream.

718
01:11:21,615 --> 01:11:22,995
Let her go!

719
01:11:25,025 --> 01:11:26,415
Come forward.

720
01:11:27,375 --> 01:11:28,995
Come forward.

721
01:11:29,415 --> 01:11:31,125
Let her go!

722
01:11:38,675 --> 01:11:41,498
You have seen what this hand can do.

723
01:11:46,845 --> 01:11:48,185
Come forward.

724
01:11:50,935 --> 01:11:52,645
Is this what you want?

725
01:11:53,815 --> 01:11:55,565
Afzel's secrets?

726
01:11:56,275 --> 01:11:58,365
Afzel has no secrets.

727
01:11:58,775 --> 01:12:00,825
It is a possession of Sutekh.

728
01:12:01,235 --> 01:12:03,905
Born in the black fire
at the beginning of time.

729
01:12:04,685 --> 01:12:06,705
His secrets.

730
01:12:08,735 --> 01:12:11,995
How do you know that
this is the only copy?

731
01:12:13,085 --> 01:12:15,545
You've not had time to make another.

732
01:12:17,175 --> 01:12:21,585
If you have, I'll have
(mumble) comfort you in Hell.

733
01:12:23,135 --> 01:12:24,595
In Hell!

734
01:12:25,805 --> 01:12:28,555
Live to see her die.

735
01:12:29,129 --> 01:12:30,895
Puppet master.

736
01:12:31,475 --> 01:12:33,685
(laughing)

737
01:12:41,025 --> 01:12:42,615
(groaning)

738
01:13:27,668 --> 01:13:30,015
(music intensifies)

739
01:14:08,075 --> 01:14:09,275
(glass shatters)

740
01:14:34,395 --> 01:14:35,765
(crunching sounds)

741
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:53,070
My friends, mission accomplished.

742
01:14:57,410 --> 01:14:58,903
Are you all right?

743
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:02,340
I'm not quite sure.

744
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:10,051
You don't need to be afraid of them.

745
01:15:12,711 --> 01:15:14,971
I'm afraid I've been rude, I haven't

746
01:15:14,971 --> 01:15:17,101
made the proper introductions.

747
01:15:17,521 --> 01:15:22,521
Ilsa, this is Cyclops,
Blade, Drill Sargent,

748
01:15:25,231 --> 01:15:30,231
Doctor Death, Pinhead, and Six Shooter.

749
01:15:33,231 --> 01:15:35,531
They are my very dear friends.

750
01:15:38,081 --> 01:15:40,161
I'm very pleased to meet you all.

751
01:15:43,081 --> 01:15:44,591
Very pleased.

752
01:15:46,341 --> 01:15:48,671
(train horn blowing)

753
01:16:00,061 --> 01:16:01,691
Very pleased.

754
01:16:04,761 --> 01:16:05,691
What?

755
01:16:07,111 --> 01:16:09,401
You want to know what happened to Cyclops?

756
01:16:09,811 --> 01:16:11,111
And the others?

757
01:16:12,071 --> 01:16:15,411
Well my friends, that is another story

758
01:16:15,411 --> 01:16:18,241
which I will tell you at another time.

759
01:16:19,951 --> 01:16:23,211
I see it's morning, and
the rain has stopped.

760
01:16:24,501 --> 01:16:26,711
We should be in Switzerland by lunch time.

761
01:16:28,051 --> 01:16:29,671
Safe at last.

762
01:16:30,871 --> 01:16:35,871
(dramatic orchestral music)

763
01:16:40,101 --> 01:16:45,101
(triumphant orchestral music)
