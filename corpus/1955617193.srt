Women and children.

It has been said through the ages, without
sacrifice, there can be no victory.

59
00:06:33,888 --> 00:06:37,847
I've seen it all.

60
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:42,426
I'm Optimus Prime.

61
00:06:42,451 --> 00:06:45,545

These are terible times

65
00:07:00,872 --> 00:07:03,864
Optimus Prime has left us.

66
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:08,622
To found his maker. Some
say he will not return

67
00:07:08,894 --> 00:07:12,159
His enemy, Megatron, disappears.

68
00:07:12,184 --> 00:07:15,950
Without a leader, chaos ensues.

69
00:07:16,126 --> 00:07:20,290
Two species of war,
one flesh one metal.

70
00:07:20,932 --> 00:07:24,868
Transformers are declared illegal on earth.

71
00:07:25,062 --> 00:07:29,388
World created new
para military force, TRF.

72
00:07:30,021 --> 00:07:33,539
Except in Cuba, where they are
free to play on the beach.

73
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:36,051
Holla, amigos, come on.

74
00:07:36,076 --> 00:07:39,213

- He's always busy.

75
00:07:39,414 --> 00:07:43,350
Mojito needs ice.

76
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:47,311
Ice! We are not animals.

77
00:07:47,807 --> 00:07:50,518
But this alien been keep arriving.

78
00:07:50,543 --> 00:07:54,536
Endless waves.
Too many to count.

79
00:07:55,577 --> 00:07:58,375
We look into sky
and wonder ..

80
00:07:58,492 --> 00:08:00,517
- Hello?
- This is for them.

81
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:03,707
Oh I like this, good choice.

82
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:05,376
This .. Get rid of it from my desk.

83
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:09,635
No way! Where did you get that?

84
00:08:09,769 --> 00:08:12,105
How much is the rest of our time?

85
00:08:12,574 --> 00:08:16,509
100 billion, trillion comets in cosmos.

86
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,697
I turned on the tracker
Go, go, go!

87
00:08:19,859 --> 00:08:21,918
And they chose the earth.

88
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,173
Why?

89
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:29,701
You want to see the robot?

90
00:08:30,179 --> 00:08:34,309
Are you crazy? This is an alien no go zone.

91
00:08:34,675 --> 00:08:37,065
There a reason is
bigers fence surrounded.

92
00:08:49,576 --> 00:08:51,441
We should not be here.

93
00:08:51,485 --> 00:08:53,646
We are kids, we can
get away this anything.

94
00:08:53,812 --> 00:08:56,355

This is the security area
and the alien confinement zone.

107
00:09:50,989 --> 00:09:54,857
Please step away and surrender.

108

Children. Shit.

132
00:12:11,902 --> 00:12:13,767

No place, house, and family.
You know how that feel?

149
00:12:56,847 --> 00:12:58,940
No, because you
have a bigger house to go.

- Hey, you know there's a reward for turning you in!

179
00:15:02,907 --> 00:15:03,931
- Really?
- Yes.

180
00:15:03,941 --> 00:15:06,876
Oh, you want your face
to be hit hard?

181
00:15:06,877 --> 00:15:09,846
- No .. Okay.
- Okey. Go.

182
00:15:09,847 --> 00:15:12,782
- You are stupid.
- See you arround.

183
00:15:12,817 --> 00:15:15,809
Legend. Weaks.

184
00:15:30,801 --> 00:15:32,996
- Release me.
- Easy.

185
00:15:33,037 --> 00:15:34,971
Easy, allright?

186
00:15:34,972 --> 00:15:37,770
I'm just here to help you.

187
00:15:41,078 --> 00:15:44,047
Easy, buddy.

188
00:15:45,015 --> 00:15:48,917
You bad, okay?

189
00:15:50,988 --> 00:15:55,925
Drag it from inside me.

190
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,793
It's allright.

191
00:16:02,933 --> 00:16:05,993
The charm will protect you.

192
00:16:06,003 --> 00:16:09,803
- You do not owe me anything.
- Take this.

193
00:16:09,807 --> 00:16:12,970
I can not. Keep it.

194
00:16:21,952 --> 00:16:25,979
He didn't make it, Bee.
I will go alone.

195
00:16:26,891 --> 00:16:28,973
This is a bad day.

196
00:17:02,793 --> 00:17:06,889
I got the target.

197
00:17:07,865 --> 00:17:11,926
- This is the data, sir.
- He's Cade Yeager.

198
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:16,768
This is over.
Help yourself.

199
00:17:16,941 --> 00:17:20,775
Where are the others?
What are you hiding?

200
00:17:20,778 --> 00:17:23,838
- I'm not betraying a friend.
- Friends?

201
00:17:23,881 --> 00:17:26,873
This is an invasion.
One day we wake up,

202
00:17:26,917 --> 00:17:28,851
they're in charge.

203
00:17:28,852 --> 00:17:30,911
You say they are in charge?

204
00:17:30,955 --> 00:17:33,822
They keep coming from the sky.

205
00:17:33,857 --> 00:17:37,793
Something is going to happen, you
can not escape from it.

206
00:18:04,822 --> 00:18:06,790
what was that?

207
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,951
That was a mistake!

208
00:18:51,068 --> 00:18:53,002
Wait, waw ..

209
00:18:53,003 --> 00:18:57,906
 Next time you shoot somebody, do not
off guard until you're sure he's dead.

210
00:18:57,941 --> 00:18:59,841
Put the weapon,
trust me!

211
00:18:59,877 --> 00:19:02,869
Easy bee, easy

212
00:19:03,947 --> 00:19:06,882
I am very angry, you will hope
you die as a child.

213
00:19:06,917 --> 00:19:08,976
- Shoot him!
- You will die before I fall.

214
00:19:08,986 --> 00:19:13,013
- I said stand down!
- Shoot, shoot!

215
00:19:13,057 --> 00:19:15,048
Shoot. Shoot!

216
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:17,823
Do not do that, Bee.

217
00:19:17,861 --> 00:19:19,829
Hold your fire!! Hold it.

218
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:22,799
- You, drop it!
- I will not drop this shit.

219
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:23,993
You ..

220
00:19:24,034 --> 00:19:28,994
Hey .. The military does not want to like this
, Bee, you have to believe that.

221
00:19:29,006 --> 00:19:31,998
This is a new world and
these guys are calling the shot

222
00:19:32,042 --> 00:19:33,873
All they want is a
home and you know it.

223
00:19:33,911 --> 00:19:36,971
You push them and they'll
push back

224
00:19:38,015 --> 00:19:41,849
All right, man. I like
doing shootings.

225
00:19:41,852 --> 00:19:47,791
This weapon will destroy you.
Translations, see you, bastard.

226
00:19:47,825 --> 00:19:50,020
- Maybe you want to get out of here.
- Get your plane to go.

227
00:19:50,027 --> 00:19:53,793
Come on.they're not gonna touch us.

228
00:19:53,831 --> 00:19:56,026
Star-One, cancel.
No activity.

229
00:19:56,066 --> 00:19:59,797
TRF step back.
 drop your guns

230
00:19:59,803 --> 00:20:02,863
Are you sure you do not want to shoot?
I am a big target.

231
00:20:02,906 --> 00:20:05,067
Coward.

232
00:20:05,075 --> 00:20:07,839
This is not what we want. They are all bad.

233
00:20:07,878 --> 00:20:10,870
No, they are not.

234
00:20:10,881 --> 00:20:14,009
Eagle Eye, track them.

235
00:20:17,788 --> 00:20:20,814
I have never seen
like this, general.

236
00:20:20,858 --> 00:20:23,053
This is older than Optimus Prime.

237
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:27,963
The Decepticon barricade
was spotted in the same location.

238
00:20:31,835 --> 00:20:35,771
The CIA has been watching
them for a long time.

239
00:20:35,806 --> 00:20:38,969
LEGAL

240
00:20:41,845 --> 00:20:44,939
Yes, he has an interesting friend.

241
00:20:44,982 --> 00:20:49,976
His wand is hidden in the earth, our great weapon.

242
00:20:49,987 --> 00:20:51,955
We will find this stick.

243
00:20:51,989 --> 00:20:56,756
- That sound, I can hear it
in my nightmare. - Megatron.

244
00:20:56,794 --> 00:20:58,022
- Waiting for confirmation.
- That's it.

245
00:20:58,061 --> 00:21:03,021
- Lord Megatron.
- Get rid of it.

246
00:21:03,033 --> 00:21:07,026
Tell me you found it.

247
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:10,938
I saw it a knight
give it to man.

248
00:21:10,974 --> 00:21:13,772
There are too many enemies there.

249
00:21:13,777 --> 00:21:17,736
You let him get away with it!

250
00:21:17,781 --> 00:21:19,908
We must have it.

251
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:25,946
- Without it we can not find the stick!
- I know who can.

252
00:21:25,956 --> 00:21:28,857
TRF.

253
00:21:28,892 --> 00:21:34,797
- The commander wanted the weapon.
- Or called a stick. Secure immediately.

254
00:21:34,832 --> 00:21:37,995
Stay in disguise and cooperate with TRF.

255
00:21:38,001 --> 00:21:42,938
They can not be invited to work together.
Our history with Bee and autobots...

256
00:21:42,973 --> 00:21:48,809
We will do what
just to get Prime back.

257
00:21:48,846 --> 00:21:54,842
Approaching the destination planet.

258
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:00,012
Power decreases.

259
00:22:16,773 --> 00:22:22,006
My world.
What has happened to my world?

260
00:22:22,045 --> 00:22:26,038
Your world is dying.

261
00:22:26,917 --> 00:22:31,911
I have been waiting for you Optimus.
Meet your creator.

262
00:22:31,955 --> 00:22:35,015
You are my creator?

263
00:22:35,025 --> 00:22:40,793
I am the Contessa,
the prime of life.

264
00:22:41,832 --> 00:22:45,029
What have you done to my home?

265
00:22:47,037 --> 00:22:50,803
I will kill you!

266
00:22:51,842 --> 00:22:54,970
You dare to oppose your Lord?

267
00:22:56,013 --> 00:22:59,881
Your battle has destroyed Cybertron.

268
00:22:59,917 --> 00:23:03,853
Megatron who started it!

269
00:23:03,987 --> 00:23:08,822
 You who have destroyed your world, stupid!

270
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:14,759
My perfect creation,
you are going to fix it!

271
00:23:14,765 --> 00:23:19,793
Or the entire race of transformers will be destroyed.

272
00:23:20,938 --> 00:23:26,877
I made you, 
you are mine to command!

273
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,050
How did you get that?

274
00:23:45,028 --> 00:23:49,897
'' Scottish castle. ''

275
00:23:49,967 --> 00:23:54,904
Sir, we have been waiting for
1600 years.

276
00:23:54,905 --> 00:23:58,932
I think it's really happening this time

277
00:24:06,016 --> 00:24:11,921
The knight has arrived.
The heirloom has returned.

278
00:24:12,923 --> 00:24:17,883
Finally it will all start.

279
00:24:30,874 --> 00:24:32,865
Come on!

280
00:24:37,948 --> 00:24:40,781
Forward!

281
00:24:48,058 --> 00:24:50,856
Yes!

282
00:24:52,796 --> 00:24:55,822
Okay, thanks.

283
00:24:56,967 --> 00:24:59,902
I was unaware.

284
00:24:59,903 --> 00:25:03,771
- The reason why you're careless.
- Same as you are single.

285
00:25:03,807 --> 00:25:05,968
What ..?

286
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,869
Idiot

287
00:25:24,027 --> 00:25:29,932
Dear God. I'm late. Oh!

288
00:25:29,933 --> 00:25:36,771
484 years of struggle for
free from barbarism.

289
00:25:36,807 --> 00:25:40,903
Two worlds colliding  and
only one survivs.

290
00:25:40,911 --> 00:25:44,972
Lancelot, Percival, King Arthur.

291
00:25:45,015 --> 00:25:52,012
Honorable men, brave,
sturdy, naked, sweaty.

292
00:25:52,022 --> 00:25:56,959
Some people are willing to sacrifice for victory.

293
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:02,796
Does it seem too perfect?
Because whole shit!

294
00:26:02,966 --> 00:26:10,839
Arthur, appointed from the General of Romania.
and the king

295
00:26:10,841 --> 00:26:12,809
Just plain bombers.

296
00:26:12,843 --> 00:26:19,874
And there is Merlin the counselor
King, probably never existed

297
00:26:19,916 --> 00:26:26,822
The question is,
why do we tell all these stories?

298
00:26:26,923 --> 00:26:30,051
Besides the fact that the dragon is evil.

299
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:36,989
Because we want to believe we can
become a hero in our own lives.

300
00:26:37,033 --> 00:26:44,030
When everything is lost, we can
save something meaningful.

301
00:26:44,908 --> 00:26:48,776
Or just because of the dragon.

302
00:27:00,991 --> 00:27:05,928
Well, it will not be long, man.

303
00:27:05,962 --> 00:27:12,765
Everything is ready.
You know what to do, don't you?

304
00:27:13,036 --> 00:27:16,904
We must rebuild my world.

305
00:27:16,907 --> 00:27:20,900
There is a way to heal your world.

306
00:27:20,944 --> 00:27:26,849
My power of creation,
the stick was stolen from me.

307
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:32,982
By my 12 guardian knights. They betried me
and hide it on earth.

308
00:27:33,023 --> 00:27:41,021
Giving it to humans. The stick is the
only way to bring life back to Cybertron.

309
00:27:41,064 --> 00:27:48,937
You are going to find it for me.
Do you want to atone for sin, Prime?

310
00:27:48,972 --> 00:27:56,811
- Do you?
- My Creator, I do.

311
00:27:56,813 --> 00:28:02,809
No fear, no hate, no anger.

312
00:28:02,819 --> 00:28:07,916
No fear, no hate, no anger.

313
00:28:07,958 --> 00:28:11,894
Get out of me!

314
00:28:11,895 --> 00:28:15,831
I'll kill you, flying rat!

315
00:28:16,866 --> 00:28:20,859
He is very calm.
Very peacefull.

316
00:28:20,904 --> 00:28:24,931
I'm very bored on this island.

317
00:28:31,881 --> 00:28:33,781
God.

318
00:28:33,817 --> 00:28:36,980
Oh, hey, chief.
The horse that...

319
00:28:36,987 --> 00:28:39,922
God, what is that horse?

320
00:28:39,956 --> 00:28:42,925
You really like
with Indian culture, huh?

321
00:28:42,926 --> 00:28:45,986
Do not call me chief.
My name is Sherman.

322
00:28:45,996 --> 00:28:52,868
- Are not you a chief?
- Well, but you say it racially.

323
00:28:52,936 --> 00:28:55,734
- My car is stolen.
- What?

324
00:28:55,772 --> 00:28:57,797
- Again.
- That's bad.

325
00:28:57,841 --> 00:29:01,038
You know? Everything is out of control.
Crimes are everywhere.

326
00:29:01,044 --> 00:29:06,880
- I lost a lot of my stuff...
- Stop it, just get back my car.

327
00:29:15,892 --> 00:29:17,951
This is not an autobots dating site.

328
00:29:17,961 --> 00:29:24,958
No, I just want to imagine.
Look at the pretty one. Waw, look at his ass.

329
00:29:25,001 --> 00:29:30,940
I'm ready!
I have not done that for a long time.

330
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,807
I was not intentional.

331
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:35,778
- Hey!
- What is wrong with you?

332
00:29:35,779 --> 00:29:39,772
- What's wrong with me?
- Next time, slowly!

333
00:29:39,816 --> 00:29:43,752
I want to arrive with cool.

334
00:29:43,787 --> 00:29:45,015
You're fouling this place!

335
00:29:45,021 --> 00:29:46,955
This is a junk yard!

336
00:29:46,956 --> 00:29:49,925
Quickly!

337
00:29:51,861 --> 00:29:55,797
Hey, do not blame me.

338
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:58,893
Hey, where's everybody?
There is guest!

339
00:29:58,902 --> 00:30:01,837
- You got into trouble?
- Yes, big problem.

340
00:30:01,871 --> 00:30:05,034
That's what you get for
choosing the yellow car.

341
00:30:05,041 --> 00:30:08,977
- You'll get into big trouble.
- Be quiet!

342
00:30:09,012 --> 00:30:11,810
Before I beat you.

343
00:30:11,848 --> 00:30:14,874
- You'll never be Optimus Prime.
- You talk too much.

344
00:30:14,884 --> 00:30:18,843
Come on, why are you guys calm?

345
00:30:18,888 --> 00:30:21,948
You guys are starting to annoy me!

346
00:30:27,897 --> 00:30:32,027
Come here, Grimlock!
What's in your mouth?

347
00:30:34,037 --> 00:30:38,940
I'm wasting time protecting you.
Drop the car!

348
00:30:38,975 --> 00:30:43,002
I know you took it!
Drop it!

349
00:30:43,046 --> 00:30:47,881
You must return it!
Spit it now! Come on!

350
00:30:56,926 --> 00:31:00,987
Do not eat cars.

351
00:31:01,831 --> 00:31:03,958
Return to the cave and
think about what you did.

352
00:31:03,967 --> 00:31:07,926
Why do not you control it?

353
00:31:07,971 --> 00:31:11,998
You hired me to look after them all?

354
00:31:12,041 --> 00:31:14,839
Do you think I have super powers?

355
00:31:14,844 --> 00:31:17,938
It's an alien dinosaur!

356
00:31:17,981 --> 00:31:20,916
They tried to eat me yesterday.

357
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:24,818
- You want to go to jail?
- No.

358
00:31:24,821 --> 00:31:26,948
You will go to jail.
Because you helped me.

359
00:31:26,956 --> 00:31:29,789
I'm a fugitive, I
boss, you're my boys.

360
00:31:29,826 --> 00:31:33,762
When you leave, this place becomes a wild forest.

361
00:31:33,797 --> 00:31:37,790
- I do not know what to do.
- This is a dumpster, you guard it. That's it.

362
00:31:37,801 --> 00:31:40,827
You hired me to become a vice president.

363
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:42,770
- Did I say that?
- Yes, that's what you said.

364
00:31:42,806 --> 00:31:45,900
- I'm just lying.
- Do not take that position!

365
00:31:45,909 --> 00:31:49,003
This is not a small company.
I am not doing it for money.

366
00:31:49,045 --> 00:31:51,980
You're not doing it for money?
What is wrong with you? What do you want to eat?

367
00:31:51,981 --> 00:31:54,950
He's here.

368
00:31:55,819 --> 00:31:58,811
I do not know...

369
00:31:58,855 --> 00:32:02,814
I told you he will not come back.

370
00:32:02,938 --> 00:32:05,938
I swear I did nothing.

371
00:32:05,995 --> 00:32:07,929
What are you doing?

372
00:32:07,931 --> 00:32:09,796
I never saw it.

373
00:32:09,833 --> 00:32:12,961
Come on, just say it!
You want him blown up!

374
00:32:12,969 --> 00:32:17,770
- You feel great...
- Hey, you know I'm emotional, right? Come here!

375
00:32:17,807 --> 00:32:19,934
- I will beat you!
- Stop...

376
00:32:19,943 --> 00:32:23,811
Yes, you are tough!
Have you been exercising?

377
00:32:28,051 --> 00:32:32,920
Oh, he's so annoying.
I do I have to destroy it?

378
00:32:32,956 --> 00:32:35,823
- With pleasure.
- I heard it.

379
00:32:35,825 --> 00:32:39,886
Calm down, what... Why do you
really like the violence?

380
00:32:39,929 --> 00:32:41,988
Hey, what are you doing here?

381
00:32:41,998 --> 00:32:45,934
Have you found our ship yet?
I'm bored here waiting to be caught.

382
00:32:45,969 --> 00:32:51,839
Sand and gasoline will kill you before you get shot.

383
00:32:51,875 --> 00:32:53,843
- Do not bother me!
- Watch Out!

384
00:32:53,843 --> 00:32:56,778
- Do you want me to learn?
- You tough, huh?

385
00:32:56,779 --> 00:32:58,906
What if you just bring it!

386
00:32:58,948 --> 00:33:04,045
I'm not a salesperson like you.

387
00:33:04,854 --> 00:33:07,914
Oh, that's it.

388
00:33:07,957 --> 00:33:11,916
See I found the head
Star Scream in Bufallo.

389
00:33:11,928 --> 00:33:14,920
- There is also a new tool.
- Will it work this time?

390
00:33:14,964 --> 00:33:16,932
You know it's still working, come on.

391
00:33:16,933 --> 00:33:20,994
Did you hear that? You'll be able to talk.

392
00:33:22,805 --> 00:33:23,965
I'm so glad.

393
00:33:24,007 --> 00:33:26,771
What else do you get?

394
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:30,768
Where did you get that?
Old treasures.

395
00:33:30,813 --> 00:33:34,840
And what is original?
Definitely not. Give it to me.

396
00:33:34,884 --> 00:33:37,853
- I'll take it.
- You do not know how precious this is?

397
00:33:37,887 --> 00:33:40,947
I know, because you do not do your job.

398
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:45,859
I'm hurt. There are seven heirlooms like
that which symbolize the end of the world.

399
00:33:45,862 --> 00:33:48,023
And that heirloom appears here as a sign.

400
00:33:48,064 --> 00:33:52,967
If it was real, I would board the ship and blow up the planet.

401
00:33:52,969 --> 00:33:57,872
All right, I'll soak in the oil.
Turn around, you're off guard.

402
00:33:57,907 --> 00:34:01,934
- You can not refuse it.
- You do not understand what you're saying.

403
00:34:01,945 --> 00:34:04,812
- Hey, sir!
- This is not happening.

404
00:34:04,847 --> 00:34:07,042
You can not be here in here, I'm having trouble.

405
00:34:07,083 --> 00:34:10,052
I'm not a kid, I
can fix the machine.

406
00:34:10,053 --> 00:34:12,044
- Yes, good.
- Better than others.

407
00:34:12,055 --> 00:34:15,752
I have a name.
lzebelle with Z.

408
00:34:15,792 --> 00:34:18,955
I do not care about your name
, this is not a place for...

409
00:34:18,962 --> 00:34:23,797
- Just go home!
- I do not have a house.

410
00:34:23,866 --> 00:34:31,034
And they? They just killed my family.

411
00:34:31,874 --> 00:34:37,779
So I will not go anywhere.

412
00:34:38,081 --> 00:34:42,882
I want to stay here
and fight them.

413
00:34:42,885 --> 00:34:46,844
They? What do you know about them?

414
00:34:46,856 --> 00:34:51,987
They are terrible. You can not
fight them and defeat them.

415
00:34:52,028 --> 00:34:57,864
They are aided by the whole world.
You're just a kid.

416
00:35:00,803 --> 00:35:03,897
Why are you still following me?

417
00:35:05,975 --> 00:35:09,775
Hey...

418
00:35:09,779 --> 00:35:12,805
He can fire out!
Take a look!

419
00:35:12,815 --> 00:35:14,806
Your trailer is on fire.

420
00:35:14,851 --> 00:35:16,011
Hey, to the corner there.

421
00:35:16,019 --> 00:35:22,015
Friend, I'm proud.
But you can burn my house.

422
00:35:22,025 --> 00:35:25,859
I know you can, you have to
shoot it through...

423
00:35:25,895 --> 00:35:28,056
No...

424
00:35:29,966 --> 00:35:35,962
Hey, get me some beer.
You have to stop messing up.

425
00:35:39,842 --> 00:35:41,901
Perfect. You have another job.

426
00:35:41,944 --> 00:35:44,913
I still have to train them.

427
00:35:45,882 --> 00:35:48,851
What happened to your family?

428
00:35:48,885 --> 00:35:51,820
'' Texas. ''

429
00:35:51,888 --> 00:35:55,881
- You were.
- My wife died, my daughter is in college.

430
00:35:55,892 --> 00:35:58,918
- Like he's on the moon.
- At least he's alive.

431
00:35:58,928 --> 00:36:02,830
If I meet him,
we both got arrested.

432
00:36:02,865 --> 00:36:05,834
Your turn to tell a story, or
may be hard to tell.

433
00:36:05,835 --> 00:36:10,966
Decepticon fired rocket
and blew my house.

434
00:36:11,007 --> 00:36:14,773
And I live in an orphanage.

435
00:36:15,912 --> 00:36:19,905
Hey, you're so cute.

436
00:36:19,916 --> 00:36:24,751
You must go, you can not stay here. Sorry.

437
00:36:28,825 --> 00:36:30,952
All right.

438
00:36:32,995 --> 00:36:39,833
- I'm leaving tomorrow.
- Good, if you're hungry there's food in the fridge.

439
00:36:39,836 --> 00:36:44,796
- Everyone will know where you are.
- Am I being blackmailed?

440
00:36:44,841 --> 00:36:50,040
- 14 years.
- You should be a child.

441
00:36:50,046 --> 00:36:53,777
You think you're cool, huh?
I have news for you.

442
00:36:53,816 --> 00:37:00,051
Autobots injured by gunfire, you
have 30 seconds. What are you doing?

443
00:37:00,056 --> 00:37:05,926
Transformers does not have a machine like that. Their machines are old.

444
00:37:05,962 --> 00:37:07,827
The 60's is not so long.

445
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:13,860
If I do, I will
channel his energy channel to...

446
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:15,963
- The main engine.
- Yes.

447
00:37:15,972 --> 00:37:19,931
Not bad.
Take care of what you say.

448
00:37:22,879 --> 00:37:25,905
'' The Mojave Desert. ''

449
00:37:33,956 --> 00:37:38,017
We want to get there, take us.

450
00:37:42,965 --> 00:37:46,924
We've found it.

451
00:37:46,936 --> 00:37:49,928
Let's drag...

452
00:37:58,014 --> 00:38:01,040
Six buildings...

453
00:38:03,052 --> 00:38:04,917
There are six locations.

454
00:38:04,954 --> 00:38:09,891
- They appear everywhere.
- Alien, whatever they are.

455
00:38:09,926 --> 00:38:12,053
Like a horn that grows from hell.

456
00:38:12,061 --> 00:38:18,000
- Oh my God, Cybertron is coming.
- What?

457
00:38:19,001 --> 00:38:21,765
We have to tell the President
in 70 minutes. Tell me.

458
00:38:21,804 --> 00:38:26,832
- It's an old model airplane.
- This plane can still fly?

459
00:38:26,843 --> 00:38:31,974
- Does he have cancer of the neck?
- Worse.

460
00:38:32,014 --> 00:38:37,975
It's the size of a planet
with the speed of light.

461
00:38:37,987 --> 00:38:41,013
I do not understand.
Is it dangerous?

462
00:38:41,057 --> 00:38:45,756
- I'll explain it...
- I have to go, no need.

463
00:38:45,795 --> 00:38:52,792
No, it's not dangerous.
This one must kill you.

464
00:38:52,802 --> 00:38:55,999
Three more days.

465
00:38:58,975 --> 00:39:02,934
What about the weight?
Is she overweight?

466
00:39:02,979 --> 00:39:07,916
No, this is just my equipment.
Everything is a bit heavy.

467
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:10,976
- You're so fat.
- Stop it!

468
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,887
Now let's drag.

469
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:17,917
I'm receiving signals from
lstanbul and Kathmandu.

470
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:21,828
You have 20 seconds.

471
00:39:23,866 --> 00:39:26,027
- Really?
- She is still small.

472
00:39:26,035 --> 00:39:29,869
Here there can be no dinosaurs.

473
00:39:29,872 --> 00:39:33,774
Hello, dad?

474
00:39:33,809 --> 00:39:38,974
I know you can not talk.
No answer.

475
00:39:38,981 --> 00:39:43,782
But you can hear.

476
00:39:43,853 --> 00:39:47,050
I'll keep saying it.

477
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:53,820
You do not need to save the world.
You have to holiday.

478
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:57,866
I do not want you to die
alone, wherever you are.

479
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:04,772
I know your time is only 5 seconds,
so I'm fine and safe.

480
00:40:04,774 --> 00:40:08,733
And I love...

481
00:40:10,947 --> 00:40:14,974
It's much longer and they'll know our location.

482
00:40:14,984 --> 00:40:20,923
You're a great dad.
My father never called.

483
00:40:24,927 --> 00:40:27,862
'' Pentagon. ''

484
00:40:28,064 --> 00:40:32,831
We captured it and locked it up here.

485
00:40:32,835 --> 00:40:35,030
We are dealing with
bad thing here.

486
00:40:35,071 --> 00:40:39,940
Looks like Decepticon
also wants it.

487
00:40:39,942 --> 00:40:46,814
There are 6 buildings around the world.

488
00:40:46,849 --> 00:40:49,943
It's certainly Megatron.

489
00:40:49,986 --> 00:40:57,859
Listen, he caught a member of TRF
and wanted to negotiate.

490
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,885
With it?
What does he want?

491
00:40:59,929 --> 00:41:06,960
- He sent his men.
- We've landed.

492
00:41:06,969 --> 00:41:14,000
- Everything is safe.
- The Government approves it, provided he is supervised.

493
00:41:14,043 --> 00:41:18,946
You will be there.
Because he is not our friend.

494
00:41:20,983 --> 00:41:24,885
You know who
they killed first?

495
00:41:26,889 --> 00:41:28,049
The lawyer.

496
00:41:28,057 --> 00:41:32,016
There are very powerful weapons out there.

497
00:41:32,061 --> 00:41:36,020
We've worked
with them.

498
00:41:36,065 --> 00:41:42,834
If we are going to do this, we
have to let the monster in.

499
00:41:42,872 --> 00:41:46,000
Do I know you, man?

500
00:41:46,008 --> 00:41:49,000
- I want my boys.
- Who?

501
00:41:49,045 --> 00:41:51,775
Mohawk.

502
00:41:51,781 --> 00:41:53,840
Mohawk?

503
00:41:54,784 --> 00:41:55,842
How are you friends?

504
00:41:55,885 --> 00:42:00,822
I want to kill you right now.
(MOHAWK)

505
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:04,949
See you later. I'm sure
'll kill you later.

506
00:42:04,994 --> 00:42:06,859
Allowed.

507
00:42:06,862 --> 00:42:08,830
Okay.

508
00:42:08,831 --> 00:42:11,766
Dreadbot.

509
00:42:11,901 --> 00:42:12,868
Dreadbot.

510
00:42:12,868 --> 00:42:16,861
Detained because of, bank robbery ..

511
00:42:16,972 --> 00:42:19,873
Assault, murder,
double killing, 3 murders ..

512
00:42:19,875 --> 00:42:22,844
9 people died, he even
did not take his money. No.

513
00:42:22,878 --> 00:42:25,847
We will not set him free, no.

514
00:42:27,049 --> 00:42:28,846
What?

515
00:42:28,884 --> 00:42:30,852
I mean, we can be flexible.

516
00:42:30,853 --> 00:42:35,017
- If he's using a GPS tracker, it's okay.
- Okay, okay. Okay.

517
00:42:35,057 --> 00:42:36,991
Nitro Zeus.

518
00:42:37,026 --> 00:42:40,985
Sweetheart, finally free. Thanks to
Megatron I'm finally free.

519
00:42:40,996 --> 00:42:43,055
(NITRO ZEUS)

520
00:42:43,065 --> 00:42:45,829
Thank you. I'll miss you, Tim.

521
00:42:45,868 --> 00:42:47,961
Thanks for the hospitality, man.

522
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:52,839
By the way, Enrique,
Jeff slept with your wife.

523
00:42:52,875 --> 00:42:56,003
But the government asks that he
not leave his state.

524
00:42:56,011 --> 00:42:58,912
- And we are serious about that.
- Okay.

525
00:42:58,948 --> 00:43:02,975
- Okay.
- And, last and most important.

526
00:43:02,985 --> 00:43:04,976
Berserker.

527
00:43:04,987 --> 00:43:08,787
I will destroy your brain.
(SHOPPING)

528
00:43:08,958 --> 00:43:10,892
- Not at all.
- Yes No.

529
00:43:10,926 --> 00:43:13,019
No. No, there is a limit, choose again.

530
00:43:13,028 --> 00:43:14,859
Onslaught.

531
00:43:14,864 --> 00:43:18,960
You need a bigger door.
(ONSLAUGHT)

532
00:43:19,001 --> 00:43:20,832
Ah ..

533
00:43:20,836 --> 00:43:24,829
We'll meet at the meeting point
and I have to call someone.

534
00:43:24,874 --> 00:43:28,776
Great, yes, yes!

535
00:43:29,011 --> 00:43:30,842
What do you really want Megatron?

536
00:43:30,846 --> 00:43:35,044
Just like everyone wants, man, go home.

537
00:43:35,084 --> 00:43:36,949
Yes, it does not matter to me either.

538
00:43:36,952 --> 00:43:39,853
Megatron, he wants
something that Yeager has.

539
00:43:39,855 --> 00:43:42,915
Something they need to help them find this weapon.

540
00:43:42,958 --> 00:43:45,791
We will let the Decepticon,
do the dirty work for us ..

541
00:43:45,794 --> 00:43:48,991
With my permission they will
given Yeager coordinates.

542
00:43:49,031 --> 00:43:51,966
You're tracking Megatron, at every step.

543
00:43:51,967 --> 00:43:53,867
Take the weapon.

544
00:43:53,903 --> 00:43:55,894
And I'll finish them off.

545
00:43:55,905 --> 00:43:57,839
Do not be afraid.

546
00:43:57,873 --> 00:44:01,969
There is no limit, no rules.

547
00:44:09,952 --> 00:44:12,819
Hey, guys.

548
00:44:18,894 --> 00:44:22,022
I do not know what you
doing by freeing them.

549
00:44:22,031 --> 00:44:23,794
What's really going on, Alex?

550
00:44:23,832 --> 00:44:27,859
Additional supplies, share with your teammates.

551
00:44:28,871 --> 00:44:32,864
(To punish and enslave)

552
00:44:34,043 --> 00:44:39,037
Today, we are hunting.

553
00:44:46,922 --> 00:44:50,949
The air force will oversee all the movements of these robots.

554
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,861
Fighter aircraft.

555
00:44:53,896 --> 00:44:57,855
I do not want any loopholes when
sending the Decepticon, 100 ° / ₒ.

556
00:44:57,866 --> 00:45:01,927
Decepticon has given Yeager location.

557
00:45:04,907 --> 00:45:08,934
Cyclops, Decepticon approaches
the target where it belongs.

558
00:45:09,945 --> 00:45:13,813
Can you get rid of Decepticon's hand?

559
00:45:14,016 --> 00:45:15,984
Perfect.

560
00:45:16,018 --> 00:45:18,782
You look like an ugly little robot.

561
00:45:18,821 --> 00:45:20,880
You look like a cool little robot.

562
00:45:20,923 --> 00:45:22,891
Very cool.

563
00:45:22,891 --> 00:45:26,827
- Here it is, Bee.
- Just do what you want.

564
00:45:26,862 --> 00:45:28,887
Hey, Zee. Come here,
fix the real robot.

565
00:45:28,897 --> 00:45:31,764
Doc, login, doc.

566
00:45:35,804 --> 00:45:36,998
Okay, that's it.

567
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:38,973
No, no, the third is on your left.

568
00:45:38,974 --> 00:45:40,805
No, wait, your left, there.

569
00:45:40,843 --> 00:45:43,835
I know what I'm doing,
do not tell me to hurry.

570
00:45:43,879 --> 00:45:45,904
Hey, calm down, okay?

571
00:45:45,948 --> 00:45:47,040
You think he likes this?

572
00:45:47,082 --> 00:45:50,051
It's like in the dentist's office. Do you like dentists?

573
00:45:50,052 --> 00:45:52,782
No.

574
00:45:52,788 --> 00:45:54,983
How can you only listen to him?

575
00:45:55,024 --> 00:45:56,753
Your daughter.

576
00:45:56,792 --> 00:45:58,054
Can not reply.

577
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:00,858
He has a big mouth.

578
00:46:00,896 --> 00:46:02,921
They say if you do,
they will match your voice ..

579
00:46:02,931 --> 00:46:05,764
and a computer in a different place
tracks you.

580
00:46:05,801 --> 00:46:08,770
Oh, that's how we live.

581
00:46:10,873 --> 00:46:13,774
What will you tell him?

582
00:46:13,976 --> 00:46:18,879
Brush your teeth, work hard,
move away from the boy band, especially his drummer.

583
00:46:18,881 --> 00:46:21,873
Yes, the drummer is the worst, and also dumb.

584
00:46:21,884 --> 00:46:25,786
- DJ, a jerk.
- Come on.

585
00:46:26,989 --> 00:46:31,756
We have a habit, reciprocate each other, he always
asked '' Dad, what are you doing tomorrow? ''

586
00:46:31,794 --> 00:46:34,820
and I'll answer '' I
'll think about it tomorrow. ''

587
00:46:35,998 --> 00:46:39,900
Looks like you lost '' tomorrow '' Yeager.

588
00:46:40,035 --> 00:46:43,004
That's exactly what he said.

589
00:46:44,873 --> 00:46:47,899
- Okay, Bee.
- Done.

590
00:46:48,977 --> 00:46:49,944
Come on, man, get up.

591
00:46:49,978 --> 00:46:51,002
Let's listen.

592
00:46:51,046 --> 00:46:52,911
Come on.

593
00:46:52,915 --> 00:46:54,041
Your real voice.

594
00:46:54,783 --> 00:46:55,943
For the first time, man. Try.

595
00:46:55,984 --> 00:46:57,815
This is very stressful.

596
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:00,846
Oh no, this is not my voice.

597
00:47:00,856 --> 00:47:01,845
I will kill him, Bee.

598
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:04,017
- This is nonsense.
- You know what, I have not given up yet.

599
00:47:04,059 --> 00:47:05,959
Okay, one day you'll
speak with your real voice.

600
00:47:05,994 --> 00:47:09,828
The traitor, bastard.

601
00:47:16,071 --> 00:47:17,003
Cade.

602
00:47:17,005 --> 00:47:21,942
Eh .. that thing, the code. The code is red
. Someone's coming.

603
00:47:21,944 --> 00:47:24,003
Shit.

604
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:31,781
Scan the shroud.

605
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:34,846
We've seen the target.

606
00:47:35,924 --> 00:47:36,982
Hold it!

607
00:47:36,992 --> 00:47:40,018
This is a protected land.

608
00:47:40,028 --> 00:47:43,862
It's time for evacuation, let's move.

609
00:47:45,934 --> 00:47:47,925
Cyclops, the target moves.

610
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:49,028
They know.

611
00:47:49,037 --> 00:47:54,031
- Time to go, guys.
 - I know there will be problems when I see the government.

612
00:47:54,042 --> 00:47:56,806
Bring as many weapons as you can.

613
00:47:56,845 --> 00:47:58,813
I can not go to jail,
I can not go to jail, man.

614
00:47:58,814 --> 00:48:01,840
- Hey! This is a real world, let's go.
- I can not go to jail.

615
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:04,910
I'm too skinny to be in jail,
I can not even lift a load.

616
00:48:07,956 --> 00:48:12,791
- Bee, let's move! - Let me take care of this.
I will destroy someone.

617
00:48:12,795 --> 00:48:14,763
Get out of here, Cade, I'll give you time.

618
00:48:14,797 --> 00:48:16,856
- Do not try to be a hero
Hound, we're off right now. - Wait!

619
00:48:16,899 --> 00:48:18,059
- Wait!
- I was born to be a hero.

620
00:48:18,066 --> 00:48:20,967
You can not leave me, you
leave me, they will take Sqweeks.

621
00:48:20,969 --> 00:48:24,871
Bring Sqweeks, he's a powerful robot.

622
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:30,777
Target out of place.

623
00:48:35,851 --> 00:48:37,011
Megatron, we have a robotic carcass here.

624
00:48:37,052 --> 00:48:40,920
Too bad, because I'm ready
to destroy some heads.

625
00:48:40,923 --> 00:48:45,860
This is the crafty carcass of my friend.

626
00:48:45,861 --> 00:48:51,857
Too bad you can not see it.

627
00:48:53,068 --> 00:48:56,834
Come on, feel this, bastard!

628
00:49:10,018 --> 00:49:10,985
They are coming towards you, Lennox.

629
00:49:11,019 --> 00:49:13,817
We fight them, they will protect themselves.

630
00:49:13,856 --> 00:49:16,051
Yes, we'll see.

631
00:49:18,927 --> 00:49:21,919
The tactical position, come on!

632
00:49:26,935 --> 00:49:30,029
You two, get out of here, hide, come on.

633
00:49:30,038 --> 00:49:31,972
Decepticon.

634
00:49:31,974 --> 00:49:35,808
Okay, you know what you have to do.

635
00:49:35,844 --> 00:49:37,004
What's this?

636
00:49:37,045 --> 00:49:39,013
You bring them to us.

637
00:49:39,014 --> 00:49:41,039
Cade.

638
00:49:41,083 --> 00:49:45,884
Target is 6 clicks away. They
are in an abandoned city.

639
00:50:05,774 --> 00:50:08,004
Come on down.

640
00:50:19,821 --> 00:50:20,810
Hey!

641
00:50:20,856 --> 00:50:22,790
Yaeger has important information, just catch him.

642
00:50:22,791 --> 00:50:25,021
TRF operation, do not interfere.

643
00:50:25,027 --> 00:50:27,996
They are my friends.

644
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:31,966
Hey, there's a terrible thing going on outside there, at least I want to keep my gun.

645
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,991
Not today. I keep running the plan.

646
00:50:34,036 --> 00:50:35,867
The whole city has been fitted with a trap.

647
00:50:35,871 --> 00:50:37,065
You, sit down, right now.

648
00:50:37,072 --> 00:50:39,870
Stay here.

649
00:50:54,990 --> 00:50:58,824
Just so you know, maybe we'll go to jail, so ..

650
00:50:58,827 --> 00:51:01,887
Maybe you should get used to it.

651
00:51:03,031 --> 00:51:05,795
Here it comes.

652
00:51:08,937 --> 00:51:10,802
Autobots, be prepared.

653
00:51:10,806 --> 00:51:12,068
Hey, Cade, do you mind
if I run away?

654
00:51:12,074 --> 00:51:14,975
Do not move until I give the signal.

655
00:51:14,977 --> 00:51:17,878
Oh, yes! Decepticon is here.

656
00:51:17,913 --> 00:51:18,971
I know they are nearby.

657
00:51:19,014 --> 00:51:22,006
- I'll kill you all right now.
- Check this city.

658
00:51:22,017 --> 00:51:24,781
He's here.

659
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:27,983
I want to tell you what we are for.

660
00:51:30,058 --> 00:51:32,925
Come here.

661
00:51:32,995 --> 00:51:36,931
Behold, that ugly little robot.

662
00:51:39,868 --> 00:51:43,770
Smells emit their scent.

663
00:51:43,805 --> 00:51:45,033
Disgusting.

664
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,974
Hey!

665
00:51:46,975 --> 00:51:49,000
Put him down!

666
00:51:49,044 --> 00:51:52,844
- No, no, no.
- Did you see that? He came without fear.

667
00:51:52,881 --> 00:51:53,905
Go to hell.

668
00:51:53,949 --> 00:51:56,850
This planet is hell.

669
00:51:56,885 --> 00:51:58,011
Ah! What's in your hands!

670
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:00,989
- Put him down!
- Shit.

671
00:52:00,989 --> 00:52:02,980
- You think I'm scared of you guys, bastards?
- Hey, stop.

672
00:52:02,991 --> 00:52:07,985
Cade Yaeger, I need that talisman.

673
00:52:15,771 --> 00:52:18,763
You're crazy! You do not know what you're doing!

674
00:52:18,807 --> 00:52:19,865
You can not come with me anywhere!

675
00:52:19,875 --> 00:52:23,811
- Do not lose them!
- I will chase them.

676
00:52:37,993 --> 00:52:40,826
Do not move!

677
00:52:47,836 --> 00:52:49,997
I can laugh.

678
00:52:52,808 --> 00:52:56,767
The chubby head, fantastic.

679
00:52:56,778 --> 00:53:00,805
Decepticon, back off!

680
00:53:01,917 --> 00:53:04,784
Let's play around with this thing.

681
00:53:07,789 --> 00:53:09,757
That's the only plan you have?

682
00:53:09,791 --> 00:53:12,021
Duck, duck!

683
00:53:14,029 --> 00:53:17,760
- What is it?
- TRF.

684
00:53:17,799 --> 00:53:18,766
I will go in there.

685
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:19,789
Come on. Run!

686
00:53:19,801 --> 00:53:22,827
This should be for terrorists, not
Americans who pay taxes.

687
00:53:22,871 --> 00:53:24,839
Not that I pay taxes, but ..

688
00:53:24,873 --> 00:53:29,003
Hey, Max, Prime, stop playing around, come on.

689
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:31,911
Am I the only one here?

690
00:53:32,914 --> 00:53:35,041
Ouch ..

691
00:53:35,851 --> 00:53:38,046
This is not true.

692
00:53:47,062 --> 00:53:48,051
We're safe here.

693
00:53:48,063 --> 00:53:49,860
You're always in control.

694
00:53:49,898 --> 00:53:52,924
You should be like a mother.

695
00:54:07,783 --> 00:54:09,978
Come on, come on, fast.

696
00:54:10,018 --> 00:54:11,747
Run!

697
00:54:11,787 --> 00:54:13,914
Quick, move!

698
00:54:22,063 --> 00:54:23,894
Hide in that room!

699
00:54:23,899 --> 00:54:25,992
Come on, come on, fast!

700
00:54:29,004 --> 00:54:31,973
I promise not to get shot
and now I'm fired upon.

701
00:54:32,007 --> 00:54:33,975
The worst promise.

702
00:54:33,975 --> 00:54:35,772
Is this covered by health insurance?

703
00:54:35,777 --> 00:54:39,975
They did not do it, you tried to
to treat your own gunshot wounds.

704
00:54:40,015 --> 00:54:42,040
Beware!

705
00:54:44,786 --> 00:54:45,878
Run! Run!

706
00:54:45,921 --> 00:54:47,980
Run!

707
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:16,918
Target is visible, ready to attack.

708
00:55:16,918 --> 00:55:19,887
You must be dead.

709
00:55:33,969 --> 00:55:36,938
Oh, shit, there's another one!

710
00:55:37,873 --> 00:55:38,965
Let me handle this.

711
00:55:38,974 --> 00:55:39,963
What are you doing?

712
00:55:40,008 --> 00:55:42,977
This machine has a face scanner.

713
00:55:42,978 --> 00:55:45,003
Are you crazy?

714
00:55:45,013 --> 00:55:46,776
- Stay behind me!
- What?

715
00:55:46,815 --> 00:55:48,783
- I will not do it.
- I handled this, standing behind me.

716
00:55:48,783 --> 00:55:50,011
- Do not do that. What are you doing?
- Go behind me.

717
00:55:50,051 --> 00:55:52,019
- He did not shoot me. - I will not do it to myself.

718
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:53,954
That's a bad idea!

719
00:55:53,955 --> 00:55:54,887
Oh!

720
00:55:54,923 --> 00:55:56,914
Shit.

721
00:55:58,827 --> 00:56:01,762
Gosh! Are you okay?

722
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:08,997
- Cade, I just wanted to say
to you, I love you friend. - What?

723
00:56:09,037 --> 00:56:11,801
The work is not the way I think, but I appreciate it all.

724
00:56:11,806 --> 00:56:12,033
What are you doing?

725
00:56:12,073 --> 00:56:14,769
I'm dying.

726
00:56:14,776 --> 00:56:16,971
It's just a rubber bullet, man.

727
00:56:17,846 --> 00:56:19,973
- No holes? - No holes.
No bullets, nothing.

728
00:56:19,981 --> 00:56:22,848
- No holes!
- Stand up and do not pretend like a hero.

729
00:56:22,884 --> 00:56:23,908
Is it just a rubber bullet?

730
00:56:23,919 --> 00:56:26,945
The pain is like a real bullet,
friend. I think it broke through my body.

731
00:56:26,955 --> 00:56:29,856
Come on, we move now.

732
00:56:34,930 --> 00:56:36,022
They always want to attack.

733
00:56:36,064 --> 00:56:40,057
Okay, we'll kill the big one, and we'll finish it all off.

734
00:56:41,002 --> 00:56:42,026
Come on.

735
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:43,833
Come on, come on, fast.

736
00:56:43,872 --> 00:56:45,931
They are coming.

737
00:56:47,976 --> 00:56:49,841
- Gosh!
- Leprechaun!

738
00:56:49,844 --> 00:56:50,970
Who are you?

739
00:56:51,012 --> 00:56:54,914
Leprechaun, is a small, green,
and Irish creature, and it is offensive.

740
00:56:54,916 --> 00:56:56,884
What do you see, little girl?

741
00:56:56,885 --> 00:56:58,944
What do you see?

742
00:56:58,954 --> 00:57:01,923
Hello, Mr. Cade, I'm assigned here to take you away.

743
00:57:01,957 --> 00:57:03,049
- Take me away?
- Correct.

744
00:57:03,058 --> 00:57:06,027
No, no, you will not bring anything!

745
00:57:09,064 --> 00:57:13,023
- Oh, dude, slowly.
- Do you want to make a fuss?

746
00:57:16,838 --> 00:57:20,001
- Oh, no! Oh shit!
- No, Cade!

747
00:57:20,008 --> 00:57:23,034
- Cade! Cade!
- Hold on!

748
00:57:26,948 --> 00:57:28,779
Hold on!

749
00:57:28,783 --> 00:57:30,045
Oh, I'm so careless.

750
00:57:30,085 --> 00:57:33,919
- Is he still alive.
Is he still alive? - Hold on.

751
00:57:33,922 --> 00:57:36,948
No, he will die.

752
00:57:39,894 --> 00:57:43,830
My lord, this is not my fault, but he
just stepped out of the elevator.

753
00:57:43,865 --> 00:57:45,025
- 10 floors.
- Oh, my God.

754
00:57:45,066 --> 00:57:46,931
Do you have a backup plan, sir?

755
00:57:46,935 --> 00:57:50,962
- Is he still alive?
- I do not know, he just flew away.

756
00:58:38,787 --> 00:58:39,845
Ah, there you are.

757
00:58:39,888 --> 00:58:40,946
Nice to see you still alive.

758
00:58:40,989 --> 00:58:42,957
As nothing happened.

759
00:58:42,957 --> 00:58:46,893
- This will keep you clean.
- Hey, wait!

760
00:58:46,928 --> 00:58:49,829
- Back off, man!
- Look, you've looked better, sir.

761
00:58:49,831 --> 00:58:53,858
- Who are you? - My name, Cogman, sir.
And I'm here because of it.

762
00:58:53,902 --> 00:58:56,871
And it's here because of you.

763
00:58:56,905 --> 00:59:00,807
It will not escape from you until your work is done.

764
00:59:00,842 --> 00:59:01,900
Ah!

765
00:59:01,910 --> 00:59:04,970
You've been selected.

766
00:59:05,814 --> 00:59:08,874
- I'm not elected. 
- I'll explain everything if you want to come with me.

767
00:59:08,917 --> 00:59:11,010
I'm gonna destroy this cockroach
for you, Cade.

768
00:59:11,052 --> 00:59:16,012
Do not kill the messenger,
or I will kill you.

769
00:59:16,825 --> 00:59:18,850
Oops!

770
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:21,829
Well, now, I'm afraid all this
mess is caused by you.

771
00:59:21,830 --> 00:59:25,926
- If you want to save your friend,you're leaving. 
- That's her Leprechaun.

772
00:59:25,967 --> 00:59:27,992
Escape with the Head of the ninja servant?

773
00:59:28,036 --> 00:59:32,939
Your friend will be saved if you do not exist, and your presence is not safe.

774
00:59:32,941 --> 00:59:37,776
You are more important than you ever imagined.

775
00:59:37,812 --> 00:59:39,871
You're needed, sir.

776
00:59:39,881 --> 00:59:41,781
Immediately.

777
00:59:41,783 --> 00:59:44,946
Tuanku always say, all
important decisions in life ..

778
00:59:44,953 --> 00:59:50,823
often depends only on one moment.

779
00:59:57,899 --> 00:59:58,991
You will be fine.

780
00:59:59,033 --> 01:00:00,933
Now we are family.

781
01:00:00,935 --> 01:00:02,903
I promise I will take care of you.

782
01:00:02,904 --> 01:00:05,805
The plane is waiting.
We're going to England.

783
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,831
Bee.

784
01:00:07,909 --> 01:00:11,868
With, little girl, I'm the
-in control now.

785
01:00:11,913 --> 01:00:16,907
Do not expect a story to sleep.

786
01:00:22,824 --> 01:00:29,787
Welcome to Air Folger Flight,
wear seat belt, no snacks,
drinks and fun.

787
01:00:29,797 --> 01:00:32,789
- Track, Yaeger.
- He's in the air now.

788
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,768
It needs a search, but ultimately we can find him.

789
01:00:34,802 --> 01:00:36,793
The Megatron crew, on a trip to England.

790
01:00:36,804 --> 01:00:39,864
So is with Yaeger, it just happens.

791
01:00:39,874 --> 01:00:44,937
I want you to fly with
Your team to England, as soon as possible.

792
01:00:46,981 --> 01:00:49,950
Lift up, pick up the phone.

793
01:00:50,852 --> 01:00:52,752
- Yes. Oh, you again.
- Do not hang up.

794
01:00:52,787 --> 01:00:54,982
I'm telling you you can not give me anything, off you go.

795
01:00:54,989 --> 01:00:57,856
I need help, I want
help but can not ..

796
01:00:57,892 --> 01:01:00,952
You have a flight, Cuba has no
flight since 1940, so does the pilot.

797
01:01:00,995 --> 01:01:02,929
Books about Cybertron.

798
01:01:02,931 --> 01:01:03,898
I found it.

799
01:01:03,898 --> 01:01:06,833
- It seems impossible. - Not if you know the correct cleaner.

800
01:01:06,868 --> 01:01:10,031
And I know a lot. The book is there,
never seen for centuries.

801
01:01:10,038 --> 01:01:12,939
Interesting, made especially for
disappear at room temperature.

802
01:01:12,974 --> 01:01:16,000
and made of some sort of gold
sky or something.

803
01:01:16,010 --> 01:01:18,979
The Trinity Library, today, at 4 pm.

804
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:22,973
Come, if you want to know how serious I am.

805
01:01:27,789 --> 01:01:31,953
The object is certain is the planet destroyed Cybertron.

806
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:36,793
7 more hours before the collision.

807
01:01:39,033 --> 01:01:42,935
Optimus, it's time you know the truth.

808
01:01:42,971 --> 01:01:47,772
The place you call Earth, has another name.

809
01:01:47,775 --> 01:01:49,868
Unicron.

810
01:01:49,911 --> 01:01:53,813
Earth, Unicron?

811
01:01:53,848 --> 01:01:56,908
The old enemy of Cybertron.

812
01:01:56,951 --> 01:02:00,910
Yes. You're gonna kill him.

813
01:02:00,955 --> 01:02:05,915
With my wand, we will
dry up life on Unicron.

814
01:02:05,927 --> 01:02:08,896
- The earth will die.
- Yes.

815
01:02:08,896 --> 01:02:11,888
And your world will be reborn.

816
01:02:11,933 --> 01:02:15,767
Nemesis Prime.

817
01:02:15,803 --> 01:02:20,968
I will fight whomever
_ is blocking my path.

818
01:02:20,975 --> 01:02:25,810
The alien shape is continuously shaped,
some of which are 400 meters in size.

819
01:02:25,847 --> 01:02:27,940
Alien crap.

820
01:02:27,949 --> 01:02:30,008
Have you found a man, Viviane?

821
01:02:30,018 --> 01:02:31,815
- No.
- Too bad.

822
01:02:31,853 --> 01:02:36,813
He really has to search here. And many
once, and some of them are very tempting.

823
01:02:36,824 --> 01:02:38,917
This one is looking for WCB I do not know what it is.

824
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,825
- That, a car, baby.
- Correct.

825
01:02:40,862 --> 01:02:42,887
- Great Beautiful Lady.
- Is it true?

826
01:02:42,897 --> 01:02:43,886
Who knows.

827
01:02:43,931 --> 01:02:45,023
Dear God.

828
01:02:45,066 --> 01:02:50,026
- Oh, this one has its own bottom space.
- Great, I like the basement.

829
01:02:50,038 --> 01:02:53,838
Look, it's perfect for you.
You like old things. You like that.

830
01:02:53,875 --> 01:02:56,867
History is being rewritten and
you want to talk about men.

831
01:02:56,911 --> 01:02:58,845
Or woman.

832
01:02:58,846 --> 01:03:02,043
- Oh, again.
- Women looking for women, here it is.

833
01:03:02,050 --> 01:03:03,984
You can ask me
about my job.

834
01:03:04,018 --> 01:03:07,920
Why do we do that?
That's just a dusty old book.

835
01:03:07,922 --> 01:03:10,823
- No, I welcome the end of the day.
- What is so bad ..

836
01:03:10,825 --> 01:03:12,986
About me that you have and
I have with your father.

837
01:03:12,994 --> 01:03:15,895
- He will ask.
- Do you know the father I do not have?

838
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:21,061
A thing he likes to be around at the table
he says he is praying for me ..

839
01:03:21,069 --> 01:03:23,936
- Honor.
- You can say that again.

840
01:03:23,971 --> 01:03:26,906
If only you could stop longing
people who had died.

841
01:03:26,908 --> 01:03:29,843
You may want to check
learning. The garbage.

842
01:03:29,877 --> 01:03:32,869
There may be something
that you want to save.

843
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:58,838
Do not touch it.

844
01:03:58,873 --> 01:04:01,933
Sorry, dad.

845
01:04:02,910 --> 01:04:07,779
I do not want anything for you
said I take a lot.

846
01:04:14,989 --> 01:04:20,950
Joe Elfod,
emergency request by High Lea. At this time.

847
01:04:27,902 --> 01:04:30,029
Oh, God. Stop!

848
01:04:30,071 --> 01:04:32,767
Fuck!

849
01:04:32,874 --> 01:04:36,002
Fuck, oh God!

850
01:04:36,911 --> 01:04:39,812
Move!

851
01:04:39,881 --> 01:04:42,782
God, sorry!

852
01:04:43,017 --> 01:04:46,009
Okay! Okay!

853
01:04:49,023 --> 01:04:50,991
Ah, please, lady,
do not do that!

854
01:04:51,025 --> 01:04:53,892
- What? Oh, you live.
- This will be a rough ride.

855
01:04:53,895 --> 01:04:58,923
- You're one of them!
- Be quiet! Just there!

856
01:05:05,807 --> 01:05:07,866
So, damn it!

857
01:05:07,875 --> 01:05:09,809
High wave, shock wave!

858
01:05:09,844 --> 01:05:12,005
Please, let me know that I
kidnapped from one of the famous ones.

859
01:05:12,013 --> 01:05:14,038
I'm so sick of all this!

860
01:05:14,081 --> 01:05:16,777
Oh, please! I'm being kidnapped!

861
01:05:16,784 --> 01:05:19,776
Miss, sit down!

862
01:05:19,821 --> 01:05:24,019
Please! Please help!
Help me! Help me!

863
01:05:24,025 --> 01:05:27,984
Help me, please, I'm here!

864
01:05:34,969 --> 01:05:35,993
Wow!

865
01:05:36,003 --> 01:05:39,871
Wow, I love this car!

866
01:05:39,974 --> 01:05:42,943
Oh, God. Police!

867
01:05:54,922 --> 01:05:58,983
Haha, great introduction.

868
01:06:09,003 --> 01:06:12,803
It's okay, David.

869
01:06:16,811 --> 01:06:20,008
There, come on. There.

870
01:06:37,999 --> 01:06:41,765
We have guests, stop that!

871
01:06:41,802 --> 01:06:44,896
- Stop your lecture!

872
01:06:44,939 --> 01:06:46,998
Hello there!

873
01:06:47,008 --> 01:06:49,977
What the fuck?

874
01:06:50,011 --> 01:06:53,037
- It's done, stupid.
- I really am sorry about that.

875
01:06:53,047 --> 01:06:58,849
But he, uh, you know, he still
think this is still 1918 or 1914.

876
01:06:58,886 --> 01:07:00,820
- Something like that? I know.
- Very sad.

877
01:07:00,855 --> 01:07:02,948
The journey of war, something like that.

878
01:07:02,990 --> 01:07:04,924
I mean, a better person,
more than a few,

879
01:07:04,926 --> 01:07:06,951
A better man,
day excited is better ..

880
01:07:06,961 --> 01:07:09,896
As a matter of death
and life and its kind.

881
01:07:09,897 --> 01:07:12,024
- That's sad, sir.
- Far from Tibere.

882
01:07:12,066 --> 01:07:13,829
This is a long journey.

883
01:07:13,868 --> 01:07:18,931
Yes, but bad. I mean very
sad. You remember that, I mean.

884
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:22,808
You know there's a leak to the brain
.

885
01:07:22,843 --> 01:07:24,777
Dementia robot.

886
01:07:24,779 --> 01:07:26,906
You know sad.

887
01:07:26,948 --> 01:07:29,815
Yes, I do not know why you
smoke on that pipe, mate.

888
01:07:29,817 --> 01:07:31,910
But, what is going on here?

889
01:07:31,953 --> 01:07:34,012
Did you drag me
to the time of the transformer?

890
01:07:34,021 --> 01:07:35,955
If he's the best person for me to speak, I'm outta here!

891
01:07:35,957 --> 01:07:39,757
Wow, wow, wow. Okay.
Um .. Bumblebee.

892
01:07:39,794 --> 01:07:42,854
We only met when I was
small, shorts, so be it.

893
01:07:42,897 --> 01:07:44,922
Probably higher or shorter,
I can not remember it.

894
01:07:44,932 --> 01:07:47,799
- But I never forget the face.
- Hey, you remember this guy?

895
01:07:47,835 --> 01:07:49,962
I do not know you!

896
01:07:49,971 --> 01:07:54,772
Let me see this, right?
Please. Very interesting.

897
01:07:54,809 --> 01:07:59,007
Yes, you keep a secret for very long ..

898
01:07:59,013 --> 01:08:02,005
You know it will be real
deep deep.

899
01:08:02,049 --> 01:08:04,882
You're starting to get curious.

900
01:08:04,885 --> 01:08:07,945
Is my life useless?

901
01:08:07,955 --> 01:08:11,823
Did you ever feel that way, Mr. Cade?

902
01:08:11,993 --> 01:08:16,930
Cuman Cade. Look, old, I do not have much patience for
_ puzzles now.

903
01:08:16,964 --> 01:08:20,832
Yes, but you want to know, buddy?

904
01:08:20,835 --> 01:08:22,894
Why do they keep popping up here?

905
01:08:22,937 --> 01:08:26,964
To Earth. Correct?

906
01:08:27,908 --> 01:08:32,902
Ah, I really like the right time.

907
01:08:34,849 --> 01:08:38,876
It's really great.

908
01:08:43,024 --> 01:08:44,992
- No, no, no!
- Wait!

909
01:08:45,026 --> 01:08:47,790
No, no, no. Its small.
Why should you be like that?

910
01:08:47,795 --> 01:08:49,786
- No, back off!
- See there! Hey!

911
01:08:49,830 --> 01:08:50,922
Wait!

912
01:08:50,931 --> 01:08:54,924
So, this kind of kidnapping situation or
his first transformer experience him?

913
01:08:54,935 --> 01:08:57,927
It must be both.

914
01:08:58,839 --> 01:09:02,036
He has a good fighting ability!

915
01:09:02,043 --> 01:09:06,002
He is very complicated!

916
01:09:06,814 --> 01:09:07,940
My name is Edmund Burton.

917
01:09:07,948 --> 01:09:12,851
Descendent to 12. The last member of
who survived the Witwattin Sect.

918
01:09:12,887 --> 01:09:16,983
Wow. How are you?

919
01:09:22,863 --> 01:09:26,799
- Does he have to peek like that?
- Hello, miss.

920
01:09:26,801 --> 01:09:28,962
As I say, hot, hot.

921
01:09:28,969 --> 01:09:31,767
- Say what?
- Hot, hot.

922
01:09:31,806 --> 01:09:33,774
- As red?
- Hot, hot.

923
01:09:33,808 --> 01:09:37,869
- Hot means sexy. A French accent only.
- Is he French?

924
01:09:37,912 --> 01:09:39,971
- No, he just likes his accent.
- No, no, no!

925
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:42,972
I hate the accent, but I
can not get rid of it.

926
01:09:43,017 --> 01:09:44,917
I'm stuck with his accent.

927
01:09:44,919 --> 01:09:46,750
- Yes!
- He's a soldier, Miss Vivian.

928
01:09:46,787 --> 01:09:49,813
He swears to your father
to protect you.

929
01:09:49,824 --> 01:09:51,917
- Oh.
- What a wonderful one you have.

930
01:09:51,959 --> 01:09:55,019
It's a great vehicle, you can travel from Buckingham in that car.

931
01:09:55,029 --> 01:09:58,897
Okay, you, American man. Shut up.

932
01:09:58,933 --> 01:10:00,764
What am I doing here?

933
01:10:00,801 --> 01:10:03,827
- Yes, why is he here?
- Introduction.

934
01:10:03,838 --> 01:10:07,035
Miss Vivian Wembley, historian from Oxford
co-author also as Doctor of philosophy at Oxford.

935
01:10:07,041 --> 01:10:09,976
Also as a Mental Doctor at Oxford, I think. Anything else?

936
01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:12,877
Besides, meet Cade.

937
01:10:12,913 --> 01:10:16,007
Yeager. Cade Yeager.
I am an inventor.

938
01:10:16,016 --> 01:10:17,984
- Oh, you're an inventor.
- Yes, right.

939
01:10:17,985 --> 01:10:20,749
- What did you find out?
- Many things.

940
01:10:20,788 --> 01:10:23,951
- Like ..
- Like many things. Like ..

941
01:10:23,991 --> 01:10:25,982
- Things you've heard.
- As?

942
01:10:25,993 --> 01:10:29,759
Things you'll hear,
patterns and money.

943
01:10:30,798 --> 01:10:34,928
- Oh.
- Oh? Do not say, what is it Oh?

944
01:10:34,969 --> 01:10:36,834
You know, I can do it,
Ah, in English I am.

945
01:10:36,837 --> 01:10:38,930
And I'm too great to be here,
that's where I'm not here to be despised ..

946
01:10:38,939 --> 01:10:42,841
By parents and daughter
with stripper dresses?

947
01:10:42,843 --> 01:10:43,901
- Stripper?
- Well ..

948
01:10:43,944 --> 01:10:46,879
Cuman in America has extraordinary education in humiliation.

949
01:10:46,881 --> 01:10:50,908
And if my dress makes you uncomfortable, maybe I can just let it go.

950
01:10:50,918 --> 01:10:52,783
- Okay.
- Oh, dear!

951
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:55,050
- Quite patient!
- What is your problem!

952
01:10:55,055 --> 01:10:57,853
But I'm not a robot!

953
01:10:57,892 --> 01:11:00,986
- Gentlemen!
- Do I have to decide the head, ma'am?

954
01:11:00,995 --> 01:11:04,863
Tempting, but, I can defend myself.

955
01:11:04,899 --> 01:11:08,858
But I would love to
cut the wind pipe.

956
01:11:08,869 --> 01:11:11,929
I already said, Coltman, you're not finished to hold up the urge.

957
01:11:11,939 --> 01:11:14,874
Generally in some ways.

958
01:11:14,875 --> 01:11:20,745
Yes, my lord. Like making a cake.
Or cook food.

959
01:11:20,781 --> 01:11:24,945
Polish silver.
I tried, my lord.

960
01:11:24,985 --> 01:11:29,854
- He is the Head in all fields.
- It's annoying.

961
01:11:29,890 --> 01:11:32,757
Seriously
separate personality.

962
01:11:32,793 --> 01:11:33,987
Good.

963
01:11:33,994 --> 01:11:37,760
Coltman. Do you have that
he has lost?

964
01:11:37,798 --> 01:11:40,858
- You ruined it?
- I've been serving Elsatorsy for 700 years.

965
01:11:40,868 --> 01:11:42,961
You're the worst I've ever served.

966
01:11:43,003 --> 01:11:45,904
This is my predecessor.
Wolfgang.

967
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:48,909
And that's my aunt, Ed.
My aunt's aunt.

968
01:11:48,909 --> 01:11:51,002
For some reason,
he is with my ancestor's uncle.

969
01:11:51,011 --> 01:11:54,811
He's crazy. He's so bitch.
And he is my grandfather there.

972
01:11:59,854 --> 01:12:01,822
It's so crazy.

973
01:12:01,856 --> 01:12:04,757
Bullet holes.

974
01:12:04,959 --> 01:12:08,952
Ah, ah, no, no, no!
No, no, no!

975
01:12:08,963 --> 01:12:11,955
That was the watch that killed Hitler.
Do not play with it.

976
01:12:11,999 --> 01:12:15,935
Bad predators. It's old, but crazy.

977
01:12:15,936 --> 01:12:17,961
At home in this moment,
we have to play smarter.

978
01:12:17,972 --> 01:12:20,998
Genius, explorer, scientist,
artist, artist, world leader.

They are all included
in secret services.

989
01:12:42,930 --> 01:12:44,921
All unite in one purpose.

990
01:12:44,932 --> 01:12:48,766
Protect historical secrets from Transformer.

991
01:12:48,802 --> 01:12:51,794
Here, on Earth.

01:14:14,021 --> 01:14:17,013
During the war,
they call it everything.

1009
01:14:17,057 --> 01:14:19,890
Good is not one of them.

1010
01:14:19,893 --> 01:14:25,024
It's all started from 1414.
As king of Arthur and his witch, Merlin.

Go forward and master the Sax Muhamatoin, Mabey.

As logical explanation.

1017
01:14:38,946 --> 01:14:40,914
Oh, so I agree,
how hot it is to leave it.

1018
01:14:40,948 --> 01:14:43,849
Logic is left in the building,
you're talking about magic.

1019
01:14:43,884 --> 01:14:46,011
What? Like Lamborgini
who walk and talk?

1020
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:49,922
Whatever high technology in
it is more like magic.

1021
01:14:49,923 --> 01:14:53,757
- You are clearly learning. Impressive.
- Yes, depending on it.

1022
01:14:53,794 --> 01:14:57,059
Zero talk, Doctor or professor of philosophy
or whatever you call yourself.

And 12 behind them
is 12 from Cybertron.

01:15:34,902 --> 01:15:37,837
We are fighting for honor.

1031
01:15:37,838 --> 01:15:39,931
We are fighting for mankind!

1032
01:15:39,973 --> 01:15:42,806
For all the good of mankind.

1033
01:15:42,810 --> 01:15:46,007
The old brothers!
And the new brothers!

1034
01:15:46,046 --> 01:15:50,039
For the old one!
For a new one!

1035
01:15:57,791 --> 01:16:00,851
No sacrifice,
no victory.

1036
01:16:00,861 --> 01:16:05,889
12 Alien knights, and so it
Camelot and mankind.

1037
01:16:05,899 --> 01:16:09,801
Growing. For honor.

1038
01:16:18,879 --> 01:16:21,939
Coltman? Hello?
You're in the mood again.

1039
01:16:21,982 --> 01:16:24,883
I'm making the atmosphere more powerful.

1040
01:16:24,918 --> 01:16:26,818
More calm.

1041
01:16:26,820 --> 01:16:27,912
What's the problem with you?

1042
01:16:27,955 --> 01:16:30,822
What I can find Stanglin necklace.

1043
01:16:30,824 --> 01:16:33,884
It belongs to King Arthur himself.

1044
01:16:33,927 --> 01:16:37,920
Now, legend has it that the last knight will be chosen one day.

1045
01:16:37,931 --> 01:16:40,900
His struggle for saving the world begins.

1046
01:16:40,934 --> 01:16:47,999
It seems that Mr. Cade is the last knight
. It is you.

1047
01:16:49,009 --> 01:16:52,035
What? Are you traveling around the world looking for me?

1048
01:16:52,079 --> 01:16:55,913
No, not yourself specifically, you're not too valuable from the state of Texas.

1049
01:16:55,916 --> 01:16:58,009
Not a bit.

1050
01:16:58,785 --> 01:17:00,878
Stop it.

1051
01:17:00,921 --> 01:17:02,786
What?

1052
01:17:02,789 --> 01:17:04,916
If you do not stop it, I'll send you back to Cybertron.

1053
01:17:04,925 --> 01:17:06,984
- With your little box.
- Oh, scary.

1054
01:17:06,994 --> 01:17:08,962
I am not a noble.

1055
01:17:08,962 --> 01:17:12,921
No, he means,
quality as a knight. Mr. Cade.

1056
01:17:12,966 --> 01:17:15,799
Quality as a knight,
most important.

1057
01:17:15,802 --> 01:17:19,898
Yes, the quality of the knights, the noble heart,
boldness over justice, integrity.

1058
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:21,931
- I have some.
- The most important.

1059
01:17:21,975 --> 01:17:24,000
- You seem to be virgin.
- In hurry?

1060
01:17:24,044 --> 01:17:27,844
Yes, I was in hurry by a strange comrade
who took me off the plane.

1061
01:17:27,881 --> 01:17:31,908
No, virgin.
P-E-R-J-A-K-A.

1062
01:17:31,919 --> 01:17:33,853
Ability.

1063
01:17:33,854 --> 01:17:36,914
I know that, I'm kidding.
I know about it, thanks.

1064
01:17:36,924 --> 01:17:39,984
Not sad, Mr. Cade.

1065
01:17:39,993 --> 01:17:42,928
- It's been a long time.
- Well, how long has it been?

1066
01:17:42,930 --> 01:17:44,989
A week, a month, a year?

1067
01:17:45,032 --> 01:17:46,897
- It's been a while.
- Ah.

1068
01:17:46,934 --> 01:17:47,958
Hm.

1069
01:17:48,001 --> 01:17:50,060
Huh? What is this? Is that some kind of English thing?

1070
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:51,970
No, no, just curiosity.

1071
01:17:51,972 --> 01:17:55,032
- Well, maybe I saved myself.
- Why do you keep yourself in old age?

1072
01:17:55,075 --> 01:17:57,942
- You, English lady, be quiet.
- I just asked.

1073
01:17:57,945 --> 01:18:00,004
We are chatting about your sex life.

1074
01:18:00,047 --> 01:18:02,845
- Yes, whichever is ..
- What's this?

1075
01:18:02,883 --> 01:18:04,043
Sort of a map?

1076
01:18:04,051 --> 01:18:08,920
Well, this table is from Cybertron.
The puzzle I'm working on.

1077
01:18:08,956 --> 01:18:10,890
Truly my whole life.

1078
01:18:10,891 --> 01:18:14,918
- So which is very interesting?
- Travel Cybertron.

1079
01:18:14,962 --> 01:18:18,898
Intended as cosmos.

1080
01:18:18,899 --> 01:18:20,958
Seglastron.

1081
01:18:20,968 --> 01:18:22,959
Wait a minute.

1082
01:18:23,003 --> 01:18:25,767
I've heard that before.

1083
01:18:25,806 --> 01:18:27,000
In the exchange.

1084
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:29,941
- What does it mean?
- Your last breath ..

1085
01:18:29,943 --> 01:18:32,844
Protecting his wand.

1086
01:18:32,879 --> 01:18:35,905
This is ridiculous.

1087
01:18:39,987 --> 01:18:43,946
They have their names.
We have the kit name.

1088
01:18:43,957 --> 01:18:45,822
Stick Merlin.

1089
01:18:45,826 --> 01:18:49,956
In the description with a special race,
is combined with its DNA.

1090
01:18:49,963 --> 01:18:54,900
Which one is only he who has
key to unlock the power of Alien.

1091
01:18:54,935 --> 01:18:57,870
What they know right now ..

1092
01:18:57,904 --> 01:19:00,771
Magic.

1093
01:19:01,008 --> 01:19:04,967
His wand is buried with
with Merlin's body.

1094
01:19:04,978 --> 01:19:07,811
A thousand years hidden.

1095
01:19:07,848 --> 01:19:13,844
If it falls in the wrong hands, it
means the destruction of the human we know.

1096
01:19:13,854 --> 01:19:14,912
and love.

1097
01:19:14,955 --> 01:19:17,981
12 knights guards join
into a mighty dragon.

1098
01:19:17,991 --> 01:19:21,017
To protect it. And now his
stick is in great danger.

1099
01:19:21,061 --> 01:19:22,995
Megatron.

1100
01:19:22,996 --> 01:19:25,863
- He's eyeing this.
- So the battle is on us.

1101
01:19:25,899 --> 01:19:27,799
That's why he came here,
that's why they continue to earth.

1102
01:19:27,801 --> 01:19:30,031
Which one we have to claim
the stick before it's too late.

1103
01:19:30,070 --> 01:19:31,901
Wait, we what?

1104
01:19:31,905 --> 01:19:38,868
Only Merlin's direct descendants can
3 master their full strength.

1105
01:19:38,912 --> 01:19:43,849
And you, Miss Vivian.
The last descendant of Merlin on earth.

1106
01:19:43,850 --> 01:19:46,910
And that's how you are.
is our last hope.

1107
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:51,880
Okay, wait. Step back. You say I'm related to the Merlin wizard.

1108
01:19:54,795 --> 01:19:56,990
Oh.

1109
01:19:56,997 --> 01:19:59,761
Surprising enough, is not it?

1110
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:01,859
Only you know what the stick location is.

1111
01:20:01,902 --> 01:20:06,896
Some of you are your dad, he
surely left a clue, is not he?

1112
01:20:06,907 --> 01:20:09,933
Are you sure? He has a look that he does not know where his barrels are.

1113
01:20:09,976 --> 01:20:14,037
Listen, the only thing my dad passes over to me
is out of his learning place.

1114
01:20:14,081 --> 01:20:16,948
Two worlds collide,
only 1 are survivors.

1115
01:20:16,950 --> 01:20:20,784
Precisely your world!
And the learning time is over.

1116
01:20:20,787 --> 01:20:23,017
You were born for this.

1117
01:20:23,056 --> 01:20:25,991
This is the most recent of the worlds that came here.

1118
01:20:25,992 --> 01:20:30,759
And only we are blocking them.
Better to find the stick immediately.

1119
01:20:30,797 --> 01:20:31,923
Now!

1120
01:20:31,932 --> 01:20:35,891
T-red. Outside the castle, lock up.

1121
01:20:37,904 --> 01:20:42,000
- Ml6 and TER come here.
- Move! Come on!

1122
01:20:42,042 --> 01:20:45,842
Coltman, take us to London. Okay.

1123
01:20:47,781 --> 01:20:50,978
- Coltman, what car is ready?
- Immediately, my lord!

1124
01:20:51,017 --> 01:20:56,045
Oh, I take care of it, son! Let me show you how to solve it.

1125
01:20:57,991 --> 01:21:01,791
Hurry up, go! Hurry up! Hurry up!

1126
01:21:01,862 --> 01:21:03,853
- Get out of here, Bee!
- Come on!

1127
01:21:03,897 --> 01:21:07,890
Get out of here!
This is the time for cleaning.

1128
01:21:08,333 --> 01:21:18,333
Buying This Movie
Bearti Ki la Kena Akel
orang bangka

1129
01:21:20,814 --> 01:21:24,978
Einstain will be very annoyed.

1130
01:21:26,019 --> 01:21:28,886
Hurry up, this way!
In this direction! Hurry up!

1131
01:21:28,922 --> 01:21:32,790
Shotgun! I told you, Shotgun!

1132
01:21:38,865 --> 01:21:41,891
Checking in your area.

1133
01:21:41,902 --> 01:21:45,030
Accepted, 2C, 8.7. In the stomach.

1134
01:21:45,071 --> 01:21:47,904
Okay, TER, attacked.

1135
01:21:47,941 --> 01:21:51,035
Team leader Santos US,
what do you have?

1136
01:21:52,846 --> 01:21:55,906
Possible robot car,
you notice this.

1137
01:21:56,817 --> 01:21:59,047
TER in transit.

1138
01:22:03,023 --> 01:22:07,960
It's chaos, they run away.
Ml6 chasing them.

1139
01:22:10,030 --> 01:22:14,763
- Yes. - I get a call from ..
Henry the cleaner, the Trinity library,

1140
01:22:14,768 --> 01:22:17,862
- You're late. Do not mess with me
- We're having a bit of a problem.

1141
01:22:17,904 --> 01:22:21,931
in this moment, it's hot
and i'm angry!

1142
01:22:24,778 --> 01:22:26,871
Meet me behind, Bee.

1143
01:22:27,881 --> 01:22:29,781
I'm crappy in this game.

1144
01:22:29,783 --> 01:22:31,808
But you bite your nails,
you give everything away.

1145
01:22:31,852 --> 01:22:33,012
- Mother?
- Here.

1146
01:22:33,019 --> 01:22:34,884
- Who wins?
- Every one.

1147
01:22:34,888 --> 01:22:36,753
- Just give it.
- This is Cade.

1148
01:22:36,790 --> 01:22:38,815
Cade, this is my family.

1149
01:22:38,859 --> 01:22:39,985
- Hello.
- Hello.

1150
01:22:39,993 --> 01:22:41,790
- Hi.
- Cade.

1151
01:22:41,828 --> 01:22:43,022
- Hi.
- Hello. I'm Maureen.

1152
01:22:43,063 --> 01:22:46,897
- Do you have an underground cellar?
- Oh, my goodness, hands like Ruffle Maple.

1153
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:48,925
- Your chest area.
- Do not touch him.

1154
01:22:48,969 --> 01:22:51,938
Um. I will change.

1155
01:22:53,974 --> 01:22:56,943
- Hurry up, let's go to the library.
- This chase is tiring me.

1156
01:22:56,977 --> 01:22:59,775
ROAD SIGN ST HELENSI

1157
01:23:00,914 --> 01:23:03,849
Ml6 and TER will find us.
We must be fast.

1158
01:23:03,884 --> 01:23:06,876
My dad bought a lot of stuff.

1159
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:10,913
Let's find storage space. What are we looking for? We search like a map or a letter ..

1160
01:23:10,957 --> 01:23:14,984
or a book or .. Jeez .. It will take
years to find something here.

1161
01:23:14,995 --> 01:23:17,828
I do not know where to find
this damn stick.

1162
01:23:17,831 --> 01:23:18,957
Look at this fake horse.

1163
01:23:18,999 --> 01:23:22,901
Which stuff is here, people too
have such stuff.

1164
01:23:23,803 --> 01:23:26,033
What is happening there?

1165
01:23:26,072 --> 01:23:27,869
Check behind each photo.

1166
01:23:27,874 --> 01:23:29,933
That may be inside! Just tear up!

1167
01:23:29,976 --> 01:23:32,843
- Hurry up! Do it quickly!
- Come on, come on, it's fun!

1168
01:23:32,846 --> 01:23:33,904
I can not get it out!

1169
01:23:33,914 --> 01:23:36,906
- Oh, wow, great.
- Oh, my God.

1170
01:23:36,950 --> 01:23:39,942
A lot!

1171
01:23:41,054 --> 01:23:42,988
It's like fighting and trying!

1172
01:23:42,989 --> 01:23:45,856
Slow.

1173
01:23:45,892 --> 01:23:47,826
- I'll take a peek.
- No!

1174
01:23:47,827 --> 01:23:49,818
Every man has a secret place,
believe me!

1175
01:23:49,863 --> 01:23:52,058
Do not, it's too expensive.

1176
01:23:52,065 --> 01:23:55,000
Come on, pick up!

1177
01:23:55,902 --> 01:23:57,767
Shit! Tell me where that is?

1178
01:23:57,804 --> 01:24:00,034
Not too fast. I won it.

1179
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:01,769
Tell me now.

1180
01:24:01,808 --> 01:24:04,936
For that you have to be a special person,
you sir, not a special person.

1181
01:24:04,978 --> 01:24:06,878
We met there and
I will tell you.

1182
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:07,904
Here now.

1183
01:24:07,948 --> 01:24:10,849
Through the phone
really no problem.

1184
01:24:10,884 --> 01:24:14,877
- Over the phone do that.
- As the 12th royalty  With the power given by King Arthur.

1185
01:24:14,888 --> 01:24:17,789
And legion of
round table, I give you,

1186
01:24:17,791 --> 01:24:20,021
- asylum to enter .. Ancient ..
- Position! Not the entrance, do not mess around.

1187
01:24:20,060 --> 01:24:24,963
- Fix it.
- Enough, just tell me now!

1188
01:24:24,965 --> 01:24:29,800
Shut up.

1189
01:24:30,870 --> 01:24:32,963
Line 6 sequence 6. Hurry man!
They've been after him, come on!

1190
01:24:33,940 --> 01:24:37,068
I'm over there and it's a bit confusing to talk to you.

1191
01:24:37,077 --> 01:24:39,875


1192
01:24:39,913 --> 01:24:43,906
Come on, you said no work
today, let's be a legend! Come on, quickly!

1193
01:24:43,917 --> 01:24:46,784
I'm working on it, okay?
5 minutes! I swear!

1194
01:24:46,820 --> 01:24:48,879
You always say 5 minutes
and that means no.

1195
01:24:48,922 --> 01:24:51,823
You just go catch Rodgrido
in Rio and start the game.

1196
01:24:51,825 --> 01:24:54,794
- I hate Rodgrido!
- I said I'll be with you 10 minutes,

1197
01:24:54,794 --> 01:24:55,954
Okay? Come on, I'm in the middle of doing something.

1198
01:24:55,996 --> 01:24:57,987
- All right.
- Okay, I'm back.

1199
01:24:57,998 --> 01:25:00,990
The bastard droid knows.

1200
01:25:01,034 --> 01:25:04,834
There's a Cybertron and there's ..
There's Yin and Yang.

1201
01:25:04,838 --> 01:25:05,964
Where there is a Yin there.

1202
01:25:05,972 --> 01:25:07,940
One will destroy the other.

1203
01:25:07,974 --> 01:25:12,070
One big bastard until the remaining
1 left.

1204
01:25:12,078 --> 01:25:14,012
Wow ..

1205
01:25:14,014 --> 01:25:20,783
Earth is a Unicorn, one day
he will rise up to fight it.

1206
01:25:20,887 --> 01:25:24,846
He will end the planet to
revive himself.

1207
01:25:24,891 --> 01:25:27,018
- Hurry up!
- All right, start!

1208
01:25:27,027 --> 01:25:28,790
Tell me how it happened.

1209
01:25:28,828 --> 01:25:32,821
I just sent it.
The key to go to its location.

1210
01:25:32,832 --> 01:25:36,928
Why they are scattered around the world.
The answer is easy, time and nature.

1211
01:25:36,970 --> 01:25:40,997
- Interesting them. - It's the super continent!
That's the same shape on the round table!

1212
01:25:41,041 --> 01:25:42,838
Look again in the middle.

1213
01:25:42,842 --> 01:25:45,902
I want the exact location in the center of the circle.

1214
01:25:45,912 --> 01:25:47,971
- Genius!
- It's Stonehenge.

1215
01:25:47,981 --> 01:25:51,883
One of the greatest mysteries of antiquity,
no one understands its purpose until now.

1216
01:25:51,918 --> 01:25:54,853
- No one but me.
- That's where it all started.

1217
01:25:54,854 --> 01:25:56,822
You're the person behind the
person. Do something.

1218
01:25:56,823 --> 01:25:58,814
I will handle it,
my brother. Do not worry.

1219
01:25:58,858 --> 01:26:01,850
I've never had a brother.

1220
01:26:01,861 --> 01:26:05,820
That was good. Time
to the beach. Are you ready?

1221
01:26:08,034 --> 01:26:10,025
Viniane follows Merlin.

1222
01:26:10,970 --> 01:26:12,870
What does that mean?

1223
01:26:12,872 --> 01:26:15,739
My wardrobe.

1224
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:21,972
Viviane follows Merlin.

1225
01:26:21,981 --> 01:26:25,940
Only humans start magic.

1226
01:26:25,985 --> 01:26:28,852
And now of course a girl.

1227
01:26:32,859 --> 01:26:34,918
Maybe this is it.
Must have something to do with it.

1228
01:26:34,928 --> 01:26:37,829
Yes, God is in my hands all this time.

1229
01:26:40,867 --> 01:26:42,926
Well the team, come on, come on!

1230
01:26:42,969 --> 01:26:45,904
- Stay still wherever you are!
- Come on!

1231
01:26:46,039 --> 01:26:49,736
- Surrender!
- God, that's a big gun.

1232
01:26:49,843 --> 01:26:52,778
My Lord, the GRF is behind us.

1233
01:26:52,812 --> 01:26:56,976
Why are you parking the car
so far away? Oh, you sucks.

1234
01:26:57,884 --> 01:27:02,878
- Do not let us get caught.
- That's my specialty, my lord.

1235
01:27:20,940 --> 01:27:23,909
God, I do not ask
to kill him.

1236
01:27:30,950 --> 01:27:33,919
This is like the old days!

1237
01:27:33,953 --> 01:27:36,820
Get out of the way!

1238
01:27:38,792 --> 01:27:43,957
Which one reminds me, Sir Edmund.
Are you available for this afternoon?

1239
01:27:43,997 --> 01:27:48,024
Oh my goodness, am I seen available?

1240
01:27:52,972 --> 01:27:57,909
- Out of whore! Get out of my way!
- Geez!

1241
01:27:57,977 --> 01:28:01,879
- Hello, huh?
- It's in the Navy museum.

1242
01:28:01,881 --> 01:28:05,009
The Navy Museum, I guessed!

1243
01:28:05,919 --> 01:28:08,854
Bee! I will divert the police!

1244
01:28:08,855 --> 01:28:11,016
Scatter!

1245
01:28:12,992 --> 01:28:16,860
- More news, Decepticon ..
- We are coming Decepticon ..

1246
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:18,830
- This way will be tense.
- More stressful?

1247
01:28:18,865 --> 01:28:20,992
Oh, yes.

1248
01:28:37,917 --> 01:28:41,045
Shit, they're all around us,
we do not have that power.

1249
01:28:41,054 --> 01:28:44,046
Be acting for that, okay?

1250
01:28:44,924 --> 01:28:47,916
Oh, you want all sorts?

1251
01:28:48,995 --> 01:28:51,862
Cogman, destroy them!

1252
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:04,967
Good work, son!

1253
01:29:05,912 --> 01:29:08,847
This is a one-way street! What?
Wait this is a one-way street!

1254
01:29:08,882 --> 01:29:09,974
I'm not driving! He's driving!

1255
01:29:10,016 --> 01:29:13,918
- Look out! Watch out!
- Calm down!

1256
01:29:16,890 --> 01:29:19,859
Bee next to us last!

1257
01:29:32,872 --> 01:29:35,864
It will be a big game.

1258
01:29:36,843 --> 01:29:38,902
Aw, it hurts.

1259
01:29:38,912 --> 01:29:42,848
What is that? You're crazy!

1260
01:29:44,951 --> 01:29:48,785
Submarine.

1261
01:29:49,789 --> 01:29:51,017
- Did we get away from them?
- Hey, stop you have not paid!

1262
01:29:51,057 --> 01:29:52,957
- Sorry.
- That's okay. I paid.

1263
01:29:52,959 --> 01:29:55,985
They really love submarines.

1264
01:29:56,963 --> 01:29:58,954
- This is the most crowded day.
- Yes, right is not it?

1265
01:29:58,998 --> 01:30:00,761
That's the generation of mothers.

1266
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:03,860
And this museum is closed
for ever.

1267
01:30:03,903 --> 01:30:05,962
All right!
Away from this place right now!

1268
01:30:05,972 --> 01:30:08,873
Away from this place
right now! Come on! Come on! Come on!

1269
01:30:08,908 --> 01:30:10,967
Let's go!
movement of your fat butt! Get out!

1270
01:30:10,977 --> 01:30:12,945
Come on, come on, come on!

1271
01:30:12,979 --> 01:30:15,971
This thing will not work.

1272
01:30:16,783 --> 01:30:18,944
I mean this maze is really complicated.

1273
01:30:18,952 --> 01:30:23,889
The mission is in large waters.

1274
01:30:23,890 --> 01:30:27,917
It's one of those and they say it's in salt water.

1275
01:30:27,927 --> 01:30:29,986
That's actually quite disgusting.

1276
01:30:30,029 --> 01:30:33,795
But now this is
the greatest machine of all things,

1277
01:30:33,833 --> 01:30:36,825
the one I've been waiting for all my life.

1278
01:30:36,836 --> 01:30:43,935
To be able to change the flow of human history, you know?

1279
01:30:43,943 --> 01:30:49,882
Now in the end, I
can not join you.

1280
01:30:49,882 --> 01:30:52,874
But, my lord, you have been waiting for this moment for 70 years.

1281
01:30:52,919 --> 01:30:56,821
I know. I know. But I'm afraid I'm not the material.

1282
01:30:56,823 --> 01:30:59,815
And .. You have your mission
and I have my mission.

1283
01:30:59,826 --> 01:31:03,853
Oh, no, no. You .. You did not leave us with that crazy machine.

1284
01:31:03,896 --> 01:31:06,888
- I do not think so!
- I prefer crazy words.

1285
01:31:06,933 --> 01:31:08,958
This is all you have done in your life,

1286
01:31:08,968 --> 01:31:14,929
Your pain and your suffering for the loss of your wife, apart from your daughter and custody.

1287
01:31:14,941 --> 01:31:19,935
It's all just for
trip as it is today.

1288
01:31:21,914 --> 01:31:24,007
You talk a lot.

1289
01:31:24,784 --> 01:31:27,810
I think I'm so.

1290
01:31:27,854 --> 01:31:29,788
Em, my dear.

1291
01:31:29,822 --> 01:31:32,882
Your father left this for you.

1292
01:31:32,892 --> 01:31:35,986
For yourself. You
know how to start.

1293
01:31:36,029 --> 01:31:39,795
Good luck for you two.

1294
01:31:39,832 --> 01:31:43,029
This is probably the weirdest thing
I ever did today.

1295
01:31:45,805 --> 01:31:48,899
Only girls can do it.

1296
01:31:54,814 --> 01:31:56,873
Good luck!

1297
01:31:58,985 --> 01:32:03,012
Wow! Okay, I did not do that.

1298
01:32:03,056 --> 01:32:04,751
Jumps? What do you mean Jumps?

1299
01:32:04,791 --> 01:32:06,053
War-time submarines used to turn on the engine.

1300
01:32:06,059 --> 01:32:08,926
And there is a transformer.

1301
01:32:18,004 --> 01:32:19,869
- May I see it?
- Look? I'm looking!

1302
01:32:19,872 --> 01:32:21,032
Let me see! You're out of the way!

1303
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:22,803
Yes, God, get out of it, man!

1304
01:32:22,842 --> 01:32:24,036
- Is that water?
- No doubt, Sherlock!

1305
01:32:24,077 --> 01:32:26,841
- Of course it's water.
- Do you know how to operate it?

1306
01:32:26,846 --> 01:32:29,906
You know how to operate it, right? He
said you're in charge of this.

1307
01:32:29,949 --> 01:32:31,917
- Let me see. Let me see!
- Do not touch me!

1308
01:32:31,951 --> 01:32:33,009
- Get out of the way!
- Do not scare me!

1309
01:32:33,019 --> 01:32:35,886
What's happening on the
alien ship remains on the alien ship.

1310
01:32:35,922 --> 01:32:38,823
And at least your last words what?

1311
01:32:39,058 --> 01:32:42,926
TO center I have a positive
contact, tracking number 5205 ..

1312
01:32:42,929 --> 01:32:45,796
The submarine must be heading
to the loose waters toward us.

1313
01:32:45,798 --> 01:32:48,028
Then we have to stop them
with whatever we have.

1314
01:32:48,034 --> 01:32:51,765
Contact everyone to
attack to that position.

1315
01:32:51,771 --> 01:32:55,002
- All get ready there.
- All get ready there!

1316
01:32:55,041 --> 01:33:01,879
Contacts are at 150 and the distance is
1000. Contacts are at 150.

1317
01:33:05,985 --> 01:33:10,786
We must prepare the SEAL team and
DFV, we have to chase them.

1318
01:33:12,792 --> 01:33:16,922
Let's go! A1, ready to go.
A1 will depart.

1319
01:33:30,810 --> 01:33:33,779
- Cogman, is that normal?
- It's perfectly normal, bu.

1320
01:33:33,813 --> 01:33:35,838
Maybe classic but there
submarine behind us.

1321
01:33:35,848 --> 01:33:37,907
- What?
- This is your submarine, not my submarine.

1322
01:33:37,950 --> 01:33:42,011
My submarine? 7 hours ago
I am just a professor.

1323
01:33:45,791 --> 01:33:47,952
All right. We're leaving!

1324
01:33:54,867 --> 01:33:57,961
Put us down to 025.

1325
01:33:57,970 --> 01:34:00,939
Team 2 is behind us.

1326
01:34:02,909 --> 01:34:05,844
We get
contacts at 1000 depth.

1327
01:34:05,845 --> 01:34:07,005
Alone on the
submarine is not a good thing.

1328
01:34:07,046 --> 01:34:08,809
Why did they send
submarines here?

1329
01:34:08,848 --> 01:34:10,008
There must be a submarine ahead,
we have to dive first.

1330
01:34:10,016 --> 01:34:13,850
Well we have arrived, warning shots,
let's prepare one for the respect.

1331
01:34:13,853 --> 01:34:16,014
Shoot!

1332
01:34:23,029 --> 01:34:27,022
We get our contacts, at 1440.

1333
01:34:32,805 --> 01:34:35,774
No!

1334
01:34:35,875 --> 01:34:37,934
Hold on!

1335
01:34:45,818 --> 01:34:50,016
- He has turned and leads to us!
- Get ready for the blow!

1336
01:34:50,790 --> 01:34:52,951
Hold on!

1337
01:34:58,798 --> 01:35:00,959
He went diving!

1338
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,764
We are safe for now.
Take your hands off!

1339
01:35:03,803 --> 01:35:05,794
There is time and
place for everything!

1340
01:35:05,805 --> 01:35:08,797
This is not the time
so is the place!

1341
01:35:08,841 --> 01:35:10,866
- Hey! Where do you want to go?
- Not now!

1342
01:35:10,876 --> 01:35:14,937
Get away from here!

1343
01:35:16,048 --> 01:35:18,812
The crazy guy just left our ship
like a torpedo!

1344
01:35:18,818 --> 01:35:23,016
- I see I see it too!
- These are your people.

1345
01:35:29,061 --> 01:35:30,995
Good day.

1346
01:35:30,997 --> 01:35:32,931
Does the prime minister exist?

1347
01:35:32,965 --> 01:35:35,866
- Who?
- Prime minister, who else?

1348
01:35:35,868 --> 01:35:39,031
- This is very important.
- Oh, that's very important, why do not you say?

1349
01:35:39,038 --> 01:35:43,975
Oh, thank you, bastard! I myself
who will meet him, good afternoon.

1350
01:35:43,976 --> 01:35:46,877
Go there, hurry up!

1351
01:35:55,955 --> 01:35:58,014
- Oh, my God .. Sorry.
- That's okay, it's just this thing

1352
01:35:58,024 --> 01:36:00,788
previously in my hand
now it is moving around.

1353
01:36:00,826 --> 01:36:08,756
Yes, that .. It does not taste .. It's more ..

1354
01:36:08,868 --> 01:36:13,896
- Over there .. It's headed .. Into your pants.
- Yes, it goes to ..

1355
01:36:13,906 --> 01:36:18,002
- Be careful, is it tight or mencekram?
- This is not painful but ..

1356
01:36:18,044 --> 01:36:20,774
I do not know what this is,
like alien trash.

1357
01:36:20,780 --> 01:36:27,015
I think the goal .. We will
know the purpose if you want ..

1358
01:36:27,953 --> 01:36:32,856
- Cogman! What's all this about?
- End of this world, I order food.

1359
01:36:32,858 --> 01:36:35,952
- Last meal will be prepared.
- Good!

1360
01:36:35,995 --> 01:36:37,986
- I'm starving.
- Do not try anything with me.

1361
01:36:37,997 --> 01:36:40,966
Wait, Cogman?

1362
01:36:41,967 --> 01:36:43,867
- So my grandmother says ..
- My daughter will love ..

1363
01:36:43,903 --> 01:36:45,962
- My grandmother will be very ..
- Daughter will love this ..

1364
01:36:45,971 --> 01:36:47,905
- Yes, same thing. He loves it ..
- He keeps telling me to ..

1365
01:36:47,940 --> 01:36:50,033
- occasionally and .. Really?
- I know, yes, always ..

1366
01:36:50,042 --> 01:36:51,907
- Really .. Go on a date!
- What did he say?

1367
01:36:51,944 --> 01:36:54,811
- Go find a boyfriend ..
- Is this a date?

1368
01:36:54,814 --> 01:36:55,940
No, this god is not a date.

1369
01:36:55,948 --> 01:36:59,884
- This is just ..
- This is romantic.

1370
01:36:59,952 --> 01:37:03,012
- Sushi ala Cogman.
- Wow.

1371
01:37:03,022 --> 01:37:04,956
Looks great!

1372
01:37:11,063 --> 01:37:15,966
No sacrifice,
no victory.

1373
01:37:17,970 --> 01:37:21,929
Is the president in his bunker? Yes.

1374
01:37:21,941 --> 01:37:26,878
What about Putin?
bastard!

1375
01:37:30,015 --> 01:37:33,849
- Are you the new prime minister?
- Security to my office now!

1376
01:37:33,853 --> 01:37:35,844
Oh, excuse me, well I
use the old way.

1377
01:37:35,888 --> 01:37:38,049
Well, the door is in use
for some specific things.

1378
01:37:38,057 --> 01:37:40,924
And at this time is quite extraordinary.

1379
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:42,985
I will make this very simple.

1380
01:37:42,995 --> 01:37:44,792
Small buddy who is quite dangerous ..

1381
01:37:44,830 --> 01:37:49,893
I'll let it out we all
will die with bad you understand?

1382
01:37:49,969 --> 01:37:53,029
Thank you. My name is Edmund Burton.

1383
01:37:53,072 --> 01:37:58,908
His Majesty ordered Wickwicen guardian
secret history about Transformer on earth.

1384
01:37:58,911 --> 01:38:02,745
- Wickwicen?
- Wickwicen, yes.

1385
01:38:02,915 --> 01:38:04,883
But they all have died.

1386
01:38:04,884 --> 01:38:06,875
Not everything.

1387
01:38:06,886 --> 01:38:09,980
Anyway still not. But I really
need you to use all ..

1388
01:38:10,022 --> 01:38:13,958
- But .. Wait a minute .. You .. Appear from the wall ..
- Shut up! Let me finish ..

1389
01:38:13,959 --> 01:38:16,985
- And now ..
- Shut up!

1390
01:38:19,031 --> 01:38:22,967
Be quiet!

1391
01:38:22,968 --> 01:38:25,960
Okay, as I said, I
need you to send your resources,

1392
01:38:25,971 --> 01:38:31,910
all your military assets, because you know
once that this world will end.

1393
01:38:31,944 --> 01:38:35,937
And I know where and when.

1394
01:38:41,053 --> 01:38:44,989
You are the first to see this ship
_ from the dark ages.

1395
01:38:45,024 --> 01:38:50,860
Your Talisman is the key
to open this ship.

1396
01:39:05,811 --> 01:39:08,974
Sonar has it about 800 meters.

1397
01:39:09,982 --> 01:39:12,883
I think we
got it in the 8 o'clock direction  I think we saw it.

1398
01:39:12,885 --> 01:39:16,821
Is the light below here.

1399
01:39:16,889 --> 01:39:19,858
Oh, my God .. Look at that, it's a huge alien ship.

1400
01:39:19,959 --> 01:39:23,019
I can not say how big
this is. That's very big ..

1401
01:39:23,062 --> 01:39:27,931


1402
01:39:32,872 --> 01:39:35,898
The ship knew we were here.

1403
01:39:49,989 --> 01:39:52,856
Stay behind him!

1404
01:39:56,061 --> 01:39:59,792
Shit ..

1405
01:40:02,034 --> 01:40:04,969
This is the seal team 1.

1406
01:40:05,905 --> 01:40:09,966
Try it there. PFV 2 keep
close together. Stay close.

1407
01:40:10,009 --> 01:40:11,977
That's below, we'll go inside.

1408
01:40:12,011 --> 01:40:15,845
We will lose radio contact.

1409
01:40:24,957 --> 01:40:26,788
We are in a stream!

1410
01:40:26,792 --> 01:40:27,884
Stable! Stable! Stable!

1411
01:40:27,927 --> 01:40:30,862
Hold on!

1412
01:40:34,900 --> 01:40:38,028
- Hard to control! Hang on!
- Get out of the wall!

1413
01:40:59,058 --> 01:41:00,047
Now what?

1414
01:41:00,059 --> 01:41:04,758
You are the last knight,
you are the special person.

1415
01:41:04,763 --> 01:41:07,755
You find that out.

1416
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:10,030
- Let's go!
- I will not go to that water.

1417
01:41:10,069 --> 01:41:14,802
My flesh will wet
to the center of my brain.

1418
01:41:16,976 --> 01:41:21,003
Now both of you are
in my junk list.

1419
01:41:45,838 --> 01:41:49,865
We have been in blind ..
Blinded by the sun ..

1420
01:41:49,908 --> 01:41:52,809
The planet comes out of the back of our star.

1421
01:41:52,811 --> 01:41:57,839
It seems to act freely.

1422
01:42:19,905 --> 01:42:22,897
Dozens of people have modeled it.

1423
01:42:22,941 --> 01:42:25,876
The first impact will be our station
.

1424
01:42:25,878 --> 01:42:27,846
There is no way out.

1425
01:42:27,846 --> 01:42:29,905
The earth will follow in our footsteps.

1426
01:42:29,948 --> 01:42:34,851
The Domenic model, possibly
total victim.

1427
01:42:35,821 --> 01:42:38,881
There are two months!
There are two months!

1428
01:42:38,891 --> 01:42:41,758
The world is about to end!

1429
01:42:41,794 --> 01:42:42,988
Someone says this
will kill the world.

1430
01:42:43,028 --> 01:42:46,862
Human life as we know it will change in 12 hours.

1431
01:42:46,865 --> 01:42:50,892
The destruction in which the
experts tell you will be great.

1432
01:43:06,819 --> 01:43:08,946
- This is hard to believe.
- Yes it can not be trusted.

1433
01:43:08,954 --> 01:43:11,889
Which is what I want to do.

1434
01:43:17,029 --> 01:43:18,053
Wow!

1435
01:43:18,063 --> 01:43:21,032
- Bee go back looking for another way, come on!
- What? Are you serious?

1436
01:43:21,033 --> 01:43:24,969
Like I like to
end up in a place like this?

1437
01:43:29,875 --> 01:43:32,969
He wants us to go through here.

1438
01:43:33,045 --> 01:43:37,038
Wow .. Look at that! The merchants.
He finally came to our place.

1439
01:43:37,049 --> 01:43:38,744
Very good!

1440
01:43:38,784 --> 01:43:42,049
- We'll meet him.
- We're going to start a big show, all of it.

1441
01:43:42,054 --> 01:43:44,887
Hey, can I come along?
You might need me.

1442
01:43:44,890 --> 01:43:47,791
Oh, little lady, I
it's the worst parent.

1443
01:43:47,826 --> 01:43:51,887
Alphabot! Make
trips at the forefront.

1444
01:43:51,897 --> 01:43:56,027
- Let's give them hell!
- I'm driving!

1445
01:43:56,068 --> 01:43:59,003
Okay, I hate it once
told you this, but ..

1446
01:43:59,004 --> 01:44:01,996
I thought you were brave enough ..

1447
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:04,770
Is that a compliment?

1448
01:44:04,777 --> 01:44:06,745
You could have replied to me.

1449
01:44:06,779 --> 01:44:08,906
Well, it will not happen
organically.

1450
01:44:08,914 --> 01:44:11,906
I'm the first person to
turn on his submarine.

1451
01:44:17,022 --> 01:44:19,889
Hold it! Hold on!

1452
01:44:19,925 --> 01:44:22,894
I think it's here!

1453

1455
01:44:55,060 --> 01:44:57,858
This is a tomb ..

1456
01:44:58,797 --> 01:45:02,995
Houston Station, fifth step
to configure.

1457
01:45:03,001 --> 01:45:06,801
Turns the trigger on automatically.

1458
01:45:07,005 --> 01:45:09,030
It's happening.

1459
01:45:09,041 --> 01:45:10,941
They are in the atmosphere now.

1460
01:45:10,976 --> 01:45:12,910
Ok this is the initial step.

1461
01:45:12,911 --> 01:45:17,746
If this fails, there is no other choice.

1462
01:45:17,783 --> 01:45:23,847
Conjunctions can not be avoided, hopefully
lucky, and may God bless.

1463
01:45:31,797 --> 01:45:33,958
You check there.

1464
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:43,899
What's this?

1465
01:45:43,909 --> 01:45:47,811
I think they always keep something.

1466
01:45:49,014 --> 01:45:50,948
Wait, look at this.

1467
01:45:50,983 --> 01:45:53,816
It's a button.

1468
01:46:13,005 --> 01:46:15,769
This is Merlin.

1469
01:46:15,774 --> 01:46:16,934
He is real.

1470
01:46:16,942 --> 01:46:18,910
All that.

1471
01:46:18,911 --> 01:46:20,776
Wait, what did he write?

1472
01:46:20,812 --> 01:46:24,908
Namine erith. That means no one can have it.

1473
01:46:24,950 --> 01:46:26,941
What do you mean? We are far away here.

1474
01:46:26,952 --> 01:46:28,852
But after all of this ..

1475
01:46:28,887 --> 01:46:31,014
We will not open it?

1476
01:46:31,023 --> 01:46:33,014
- Of course I will open it.
- Good.

1477
01:46:33,058 --> 01:46:35,026
Come on.

1478
01:46:35,027 --> 01:46:36,756
Ready?

1479
01:46:36,795 --> 01:46:38,888
Let's open it.

1480
01:46:50,042 --> 01:46:52,806
You must be kidding.

1481
01:46:55,013 --> 01:46:57,811
We're so far here for this?

1482
01:46:57,849 --> 01:47:01,876
There is only grandfather, great-grandfather who is lying in a box and a stick?

1483
01:47:01,887 --> 01:47:04,754
You must be kidding. How will we save the world with this?

1484
01:47:04,790 --> 01:47:07,782
I can just cut the
tree in my house, and ..

1485
01:47:07,826 --> 01:47:08,952
Do not say anything, okay?

1486
01:47:08,961 --> 01:47:12,795
Your romantic accent will not work now.

1487
01:47:12,831 --> 01:47:14,890
- I can not say anything.
- Thank you God.

1488
01:47:14,900 --> 01:47:16,959
- Maybe someone stole it.
- No, there is something else.

1489
01:47:17,002 --> 01:47:19,903
There must be somewhere here.

1490
01:47:19,905 --> 01:47:21,998
I did not come far
far away in vain.

1491
01:47:22,040 --> 01:47:24,975
The whole world is at stake.

1492
01:47:33,018 --> 01:47:35,043
This place is scary.

1493
01:47:35,053 --> 01:47:36,987
I get a mark of where.

1494
01:47:37,022 --> 01:47:39,047
This thing...

1495
01:47:39,057 --> 01:47:41,958
may still be alive.

1496
01:47:42,961 --> 01:47:45,987
What happened to you?

1497
01:47:52,804 --> 01:47:57,798
Who came to take this?

1498
01:47:57,909 --> 01:47:59,968
Shoot him, shoot him.

1499
01:48:03,081 --> 01:48:06,847
- Look out!
- Come here!

1500
01:48:08,920 --> 01:48:11,889
I will draw his attention,
go away from here.

1501
01:48:13,058 --> 01:48:14,787
I took the wand.

1502
01:48:14,793 --> 01:48:16,784
Shoot!

1503
01:48:23,935 --> 01:48:26,995
You took his wand.

1504
01:48:30,942 --> 01:48:33,877
Drop him!

1505
01:49:03,875 --> 01:49:06,844
Wow, wow, this thing is moving.

1506
01:49:06,878 --> 01:49:08,937
He clung.

1507
01:49:09,781 --> 01:49:11,840
Drop your weapons.

1508
01:49:12,984 --> 01:49:14,975
Do it!

1509
01:49:17,823 --> 01:49:20,849
Drop your weapon, or I will drop this stick.

1510
01:49:22,060 --> 01:49:24,858
- You do not know what you're doing, stop it!
- Drop the weapon!

1511
01:49:24,896 --> 01:49:26,921
- Let's just shoot me!
- No!

1512
01:49:26,932 --> 01:49:28,900
Only me can use it.

1513
01:49:28,934 --> 01:49:30,925
Come on!

1514
01:49:30,936 --> 01:49:32,870
Shoot!

1515
01:49:32,904 --> 01:49:34,769
Shoot me!

1516
01:49:34,806 --> 01:49:37,798
You do not know what you're doing.

1517
01:49:37,876 --> 01:49:39,844
Do not.

1518
01:49:40,946 --> 01:49:43,915
Take the stick.

1519
01:49:59,931 --> 01:50:04,868
I came to take the stick.

1520
01:50:04,936 --> 01:50:06,995
Optimus!

1521
01:50:10,008 --> 01:50:12,909
Optimus! What are you doing?

1522
01:50:12,911 --> 01:50:14,811
Give me the stick.

1523
01:50:14,846 --> 01:50:19,840
- This is me Cade. You remember? We fight together.
- I'm fighting for my own Prime.

1524
01:50:19,851 --> 01:50:21,910
My own planet!

1525
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:23,820
- Cade.
- This is not you Prime.

1526
01:50:23,855 --> 01:50:26,881
Give me his wand, man.

1527
01:50:26,892 --> 01:50:28,826
Cade.

1528
01:50:28,860 --> 01:50:32,887
- I'll kill you.
- Give it to him.

1529
01:50:37,936 --> 01:50:39,904
Now.

1530
01:50:52,884 --> 01:50:56,945
Who dare challenge me?

1531
01:51:02,994 --> 01:51:05,929
Something's wrong Bee, something
is happening, it's not Optimus.

1532
01:51:05,964 --> 01:51:08,797
We have to find him Bee. Remember CV7?

1533
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:10,768
You have to be the Autobot again.

1534
01:51:10,802 --> 01:51:12,861
Look, you gotta go back
up okay, get out of here.

1535
01:51:12,871 --> 01:51:15,897
- Wait what about you? - Bee always
help me, now I have to help him.

1536
01:51:15,907 --> 01:51:19,968
- Go. - Go back to DSB, let them
know we lost the weapon.

1537
01:51:20,011 --> 01:51:21,876
Well sir.

1538
01:51:21,913 --> 01:51:23,847
You heard him, back to the submarine.

1539
01:51:23,848 --> 01:51:25,941
We are gonna find him,

1540
01:52:19,004 --> 01:52:21,939
Come on, we have to go up!

1541
01:52:24,042 --> 01:52:27,034
Shit, gosh ..

1542
01:52:27,045 --> 01:52:29,980
We can do it, come on.

1543
01:52:43,828 --> 01:52:46,854
Wait, there are waves coming!

1544
01:53:03,982 --> 01:53:07,918
I am one of the Prime.

1545
01:53:07,952 --> 01:53:11,854
You're not who it is.

1546
01:53:16,027 --> 01:53:17,995
Come on!

1547
01:53:18,763 --> 01:53:20,754
This will be the sector 14-16.

1548
01:53:20,799 --> 01:53:24,030
Send the plane to see it.

1549
01:53:24,069 --> 01:53:27,903
We see Optimus.

1550
01:53:31,042 --> 01:53:33,033
Prime, Prime, stop!

1551
01:53:33,078 --> 01:53:34,909
Prime you have to stop!

1552
01:53:34,913 --> 01:53:36,904
Prime stop!

1553
01:53:36,948 --> 01:53:38,779
Look at me Prime.

1554
01:53:38,783 --> 01:53:40,842
What are you doing? He's Bee!

1555
01:53:40,885 --> 01:53:41,874
Prime!

1556
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:43,979
You can not do it.

1557
01:54:30,034 --> 01:54:33,026
Stop!

1558
01:54:33,071 --> 01:54:37,838
I am Bumble Bee, your oldest friend.

1559
01:54:37,876 --> 01:54:43,906
Optimus, I will
give my life for you.

1560
01:54:50,989 --> 01:54:52,889
Bumble Bee.

1561
01:54:52,891 --> 01:55:00,764
You're right, I have not heard
_ since Cybertron fell.

1562
01:55:12,944 --> 01:55:17,040
What have I done?

1563
01:55:27,892 --> 01:55:31,828
I am the most
_ to do this task.

1564
01:55:31,830 --> 01:55:33,991
I know you will not be able to do it.

1565
01:55:34,032 --> 01:55:38,969
He knows I'm strong, and you're weak.

1566
01:55:39,037 --> 01:55:42,939
You ignore Cybertron.

1567
01:55:42,974 --> 01:55:47,775
Now you will see it dead.

1568
01:55:48,046 --> 01:55:51,015
No!

1569
01:55:51,916 --> 01:55:55,875
The wand! Impossible!

1570
01:55:55,920 --> 01:55:58,047
Not good.

1571
01:56:01,826 --> 01:56:03,987
Death!

1572
01:56:05,997 --> 01:56:08,966
You must die!

1573
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,025
Cade!

1574
01:56:15,807 --> 01:56:18,776
You betrayed your own people.

1575
01:56:18,776 --> 01:56:22,872
- No, enough!
- You picked the wrong side.

1576
01:56:22,881 --> 01:56:27,784
The guard knight, will kill me.

1577
01:56:27,819 --> 01:56:31,915
- Quintessa is a fraud!
- No!

1578
01:56:31,923 --> 01:56:34,756
- He made you ..
- Prime!

1579
01:56:34,792 --> 01:56:37,761
Affected his magic.

1580
01:56:37,795 --> 01:56:41,925
The punishment is death.

1581
01:57:11,029 --> 01:57:15,830
Great Notunde.

1582
01:57:15,833 --> 01:57:23,740
Great Notunde.

1583
01:57:38,056 --> 01:57:39,887
Cade.

1584
01:57:39,891 --> 01:57:42,985
I've let you down.

1585
01:57:43,995 --> 01:57:47,761
I have cursed the earth.

1586
01:57:47,899 --> 01:57:51,995
Earth, the only place in the universe,

1587
01:57:52,003 --> 01:57:57,794
The residents let
I call it .. House.

1588
01:58:02,013 --> 01:58:04,582
Well, you can save him Prime.

1589
01:58:05,883 --> 01:58:07,650
I can not do it without you.

1590
01:58:08,853 --> 01:58:10,988
1 chance, that's all we have.

1591
01:58:11,889 --> 01:58:13,948
Depends on you Prime.

1592
01:58:13,992 --> 01:58:15,926
Without you.

1593
01:58:15,927 --> 01:58:17,986
We will all die.

1594
01:58:20,031 --> 01:58:22,829
Now or never.

1595
01:58:22,900 --> 01:58:24,868
My brother.

1596
01:58:24,869 --> 01:58:29,806
I will never
betray you again.

1597
01:58:29,841 --> 01:58:36,838
I am Optimus Prime, to save
Earth, we have to go to Cybertron.

1598
01:58:36,848 --> 01:58:40,784
And destroy Quintessa.

1599
01:59:02,807 --> 01:59:04,832
His ship is coming.

1600
01:59:04,842 --> 01:59:07,834
That's very beautiful.

1601
01:59:09,881 --> 01:59:13,044
QRS to Houston, he is below.

1602
01:59:17,822 --> 01:59:20,985
Optimus Prime gives us the
coordinates into place, that is the room.

1603
01:59:20,992 --> 01:59:24,792
The weapon will go there.
Send troops and keep watch.

1604
01:59:24,796 --> 01:59:28,755
Find and prepare for battle.

1605
01:59:28,866 --> 01:59:31,926
I'm at 21,000 feet,
we saw the target, we found it.

1606
01:59:31,969 --> 01:59:33,800
The coordinates are good.

1607
01:59:33,838 --> 01:59:36,966
Headquarters contacts, visible targets.

1608
01:59:37,008 --> 01:59:38,908
In this room .. In this room ..

1609
01:59:38,910 --> 01:59:43,779
We must think about how to attack him. We have to cripple it.

1610
01:59:43,815 --> 01:59:45,908
Come on, come on, come on.

1611
01:59:45,983 --> 01:59:47,848
Nice to see you.

1612
01:59:47,885 --> 01:59:50,945
Let's get out of here! Come on!

1613
01:59:52,056 --> 01:59:55,822
Our General will take the helicopter
to the launch room.

1614
01:59:55,860 --> 01:59:57,794
I do not like that.

1615
01:59:57,795 --> 02:00:00,889
Lennox, believe me, that's our friend.

1616
02:00:00,932 --> 02:00:03,025
Aircraft Autobot, we
can use it.

1617
02:00:03,034 --> 02:00:04,899
That'll get us there.

1618
02:00:04,936 --> 02:00:07,962
The Autobot plane will drop the bomb
, and launch the DLC.

1619
02:00:07,972 --> 02:00:11,840
- The risk will be enormous. - They want to do what? At an altitude of 21 thousand feet?

1620
02:00:11,876 --> 02:00:14,845
- There is a woman, a teacher.
- From Oxford.

1621
02:00:14,846 --> 02:00:16,905
I think he's there.

1622
02:00:16,948 --> 02:00:19,007
Well that's amazing.

1623
02:00:19,016 --> 02:00:22,008
They will put it in the room and steal the stick.

1624
02:00:22,019 --> 02:00:25,921
Okay, that's the stupid
idea you might have.

1625
02:00:25,957 --> 02:00:28,983
Personally I will rely on
and math physics to save the world.

1626
02:00:29,026 --> 02:00:33,019
Not magic, fairy, or goblin.

1627
02:00:54,852 --> 02:00:57,878
There is a Decepticon clock direction 1.

1628
02:01:01,025 --> 02:01:05,894
I live for this, I live
to destroy this planet.

1629
02:01:05,930 --> 02:01:09,024
For our world, I
enable this portal.

1630
02:01:09,033 --> 02:01:14,994
Yes .. Soon, he will not
be helpless.

1631
02:01:20,044 --> 02:01:22,035
Shoot!

1632
02:01:47,872 --> 02:01:51,808
You are a rotten human!

1633
02:02:05,990 --> 02:02:07,981
Hey!

1634
02:02:11,929 --> 02:02:13,897
Hey.

1635
02:02:14,899 --> 02:02:16,890
You received a message to
bring it all here?

1636
02:02:16,934 --> 02:02:18,902
Come on.

1637
02:02:20,771 --> 02:02:21,897
Hey,

1638
02:02:21,939 --> 02:02:24,965
I am carrying Optimus Prime.

1639
02:02:25,009 --> 02:02:27,876
He will do it all.

1640
02:02:27,879 --> 02:02:30,814
Save our lives.

1641
02:02:30,915 --> 02:02:33,975
I bring
bung troops, I bring troops.

1642
02:02:33,985 --> 02:02:40,948
Knights, Autobot. This can not be
and will not be the end.

1643
02:02:41,859 --> 02:02:44,828
To save
earth and its inhabitants.

1644
02:02:44,862 --> 02:02:48,798
We will steal the Quintessa stick.

1645
02:02:48,799 --> 02:02:52,895
Just you Vivian who
can take it back.

1646
02:02:53,070 --> 02:02:57,006
I will lead the way into his room.

1647
02:02:57,041 --> 02:03:02,001
And when the time comes,
is linked to the Cosmos.

1648
02:03:02,013 --> 02:03:10,921
Let those who live long after we know, if this is our best time.

1649
02:03:15,893 --> 02:03:18,885
I love that guy, I
creeps every time.

1650
02:03:18,930 --> 02:03:21,899
I did not have time to say hello.

1651
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:24,934
They are coming.

1652
02:03:24,969 --> 02:03:26,834
You think that's enough?

1653
02:03:26,871 --> 02:03:29,066
No, not at all.

1654
02:03:30,808 --> 02:03:33,902
My Lord, Mr. Burton.

1655
02:03:42,787 --> 02:03:45,017
I got Cogman.

1656
02:03:45,990 --> 02:03:49,824
I am getting my time ..

1657
02:03:49,860 --> 02:03:52,795
You succeeded my master.

1658
02:03:52,930 --> 02:03:55,831
This is the hardest part of my job.

1659
02:03:55,833 --> 02:03:58,927
See you dead.

1660
02:03:58,970 --> 02:04:01,803
Thanks Cogman.

1661
02:04:01,839 --> 02:04:03,932
Continue.

1662
02:04:07,845 --> 02:04:11,781
Of all the people I've been serving.

1663
02:04:11,782 --> 02:04:15,775
You are the coolest.

1664
02:04:23,894 --> 02:04:28,024
- Megatron.
- I have found your wand.

1665
02:04:28,032 --> 02:04:30,933
Only 1 can hurt us.

1666
02:04:30,968 --> 02:04:32,902
I can feel it.

1667
02:04:32,903 --> 02:04:37,840
- He can not come here.
- My appointment will stop them.

1668
02:04:37,842 --> 02:04:42,939
See our world healed,
and their world dead.

1669
02:04:42,980 --> 02:04:46,040
The birth of a planet.

1670
02:05:12,810 --> 02:05:14,835
They are coming.

1671
02:05:30,828 --> 02:05:31,954
It will hit us.

1672
02:05:31,962 --> 02:05:34,897
- Bring the plane closer now!
- Come on, quickly!

1673
02:05:34,932 --> 02:05:37,867
Go north!

1674
02:05:45,876 --> 02:05:47,935
Come on, hurry up! We must go!

1675
02:05:47,978 --> 02:05:51,880
That will happen to us! Come on, quickly!

1676
02:06:19,910 --> 02:06:21,901
They're here.

1677
02:06:21,946 --> 02:06:24,813
Mastering the cities.

1678
02:06:24,815 --> 02:06:27,909
Millions of people will die.

1679
02:06:40,865 --> 02:06:44,892
It uses Earth's geothermal energy to rebuild itself, what if

1680
02:06:44,935 --> 02:06:47,927
the core of our earth is cold, which
now makes a strange climate.

1681
02:06:47,938 --> 02:06:52,966
The magnetic field is tired,
causes high levels of radiation.

1682
02:06:53,010 --> 02:06:54,944
I hope you understand this.

1683
02:06:54,945 --> 02:07:00,975
The earth becomes microwaved, we
popcornnya, given a bag, then '' bum ''.

1684
02:07:01,018 --> 02:07:04,920
We are roasted.

1685
02:07:16,767 --> 02:07:18,792
Very similar to me.

1686
02:07:18,836 --> 02:07:21,771
Looks like Wilson to me.

1687
02:07:21,772 --> 02:07:23,933
Well, they're all messed up.

1688
02:07:23,974 --> 02:07:26,909
3 minutes. Hey, 3 minutes!

1689
02:07:26,911 --> 02:07:31,939
- They will help us?
- No, we help them.

1690
02:07:32,983 --> 02:07:37,044
Some brave soldiers
sacrifice themselves.

1691
02:07:37,054 --> 02:07:39,852
I told my students
that it is nonsense.

1692
02:07:39,890 --> 02:07:42,950
Go now! Let's go!

1693
02:07:43,027 --> 02:07:45,928
- What are you wearing now?
- You ask that now?

1694
02:07:45,930 --> 02:07:47,761
lya.

1695
02:07:47,765 --> 02:07:50,791
Do not wear a boss?

1696
02:07:50,834 --> 02:07:52,825
Go to the plane.

1697
02:07:52,836 --> 02:07:53,894
- Come on, go... come on, go.
- Come on, quickly.

1698
02:07:53,938 --> 02:07:55,997
- Okay, let's go.
- This will be fine.

1699
02:07:56,040 --> 02:07:58,770
- Come on, go!
- Let me attach it.

1700
02:07:58,776 --> 02:08:00,937
Pair which one? What's this?

1701
02:08:00,978 --> 02:08:05,915
- Uh, this is correct, right?
- Of course it is correct.

1702
02:08:05,950 --> 02:08:07,815
Are you okay?

1703
02:08:07,818 --> 02:08:09,979
Can you borrow your cell phone? Must
send message to my daughter.

1704
02:08:10,020 --> 02:08:12,989
Thank you.

1705
02:08:16,760 --> 02:08:19,923
Look up the sky.
I am there for you.

1706
02:08:20,864 --> 02:08:23,799
Thank you.

1707
02:08:33,944 --> 02:08:35,878
Goals visible.

1708
02:08:35,913 --> 02:08:40,976
- Get ready for contact.
- Be accepted!

1709
02:08:50,995 --> 02:08:52,963
Attack!

1710
02:08:52,997 --> 02:08:56,023
Bee, come back.

1711
02:08:56,033 --> 02:08:58,763
30 seconds to the landing zone.

1712
02:08:58,802 --> 02:09:01,999
- I'll tell you this will be hard. - We will not give the ruins a fall, right?

1713
02:09:02,039 --> 02:09:05,770
Our flight is at
12,000 feet. We duplicate it.

1714
02:09:05,809 --> 02:09:07,834
The air is too little,
no remaining air tube.

1715
02:09:07,845 --> 02:09:09,779
We will attack in full.

1716
02:09:09,780 --> 02:09:10,804
That's bad news.

1717
02:09:10,848 --> 02:09:12,907
Oh, yes.

1718
02:09:14,018 --> 02:09:17,886
What do you think?
Anything you want to say?

1719
02:09:17,921 --> 02:09:19,889
You never stopped to mock me.

1720
02:09:19,890 --> 02:09:21,983
Commands. You're with them.

1721
02:09:22,026 --> 02:09:23,891
With them?

1722
02:09:23,894 --> 02:09:26,863
I believe in the Great
_. Optimus Prime.

1723
02:09:26,897 --> 02:09:28,831
And that's right, I do not
ever hesitate in the least.

1724
02:09:28,832 --> 02:09:30,959
You are in doubt, or
we will all die.

1725
02:09:31,001 --> 02:09:34,869
Now you want to fly with me ..

1726
02:09:34,905 --> 02:09:38,807
I appreciate you bringing troops to me. thanks.

1727
02:09:43,847 --> 02:09:45,940
Unplug the symbol.

1728
02:09:45,949 --> 02:09:48,941
We have no home.

1729
02:09:54,058 --> 02:09:57,926
Linux your team to hold.
Shoot, or drop it ..

1730
02:09:57,961 --> 02:10:01,021
Lower! Pilot, get off now!

1731
02:10:01,031 --> 02:10:04,000
- Get off!
- Hold on!

1732
02:10:04,902 --> 02:10:05,994
What are you doing here?

1733
02:10:06,036 --> 02:10:08,004
I do not know,

1734
02:10:08,038 --> 02:10:10,871
- but you sent a message.
- I do not mean so.

1735
02:10:10,874 --> 02:10:12,899
We have to get out of here now.

1736
02:10:12,943 --> 02:10:15,912
Maybe a bad idea.

1737
02:10:20,851 --> 02:10:23,786
We will fly across them.

1738
02:10:28,959 --> 02:10:32,861
We see the target.

1739
02:10:35,799 --> 02:10:38,859
- Handle!
- No!

1740
02:10:48,946 --> 02:10:50,914
All personnel wipe out all threats.

1741
02:10:50,948 --> 02:10:52,973
This is not made for
against Offspring.

1742
02:10:53,016 --> 02:10:56,008
Focus forward.

1743
02:10:59,890 --> 02:11:03,792
Center, we got shot!

1744
02:11:08,832 --> 02:11:12,768
The spider was to
divert the planes.

1745
02:11:13,837 --> 02:11:16,931
There is an enemy behind me.

1746
02:11:17,875 --> 02:11:20,036
Beware!

1747
02:11:20,844 --> 02:11:23,870
Beware of attacks from above.

1748
02:11:24,982 --> 02:11:27,815
It's a command.

1749
02:11:29,853 --> 02:11:32,822
Behind us.

1750
02:11:32,833 --> 02:11:47,833
Buying this movie
means you have been lied to
bangka kid

1751
02:11:51,809 --> 02:11:54,039
It's our landing zone.

1752
02:11:55,946 --> 02:11:58,847
Cripple the shooter.

1753
02:11:58,949 --> 02:12:02,885
Children, focus on the shooter.

1754
02:12:07,991 --> 02:12:10,960
Hold on, we will fall!

1755
02:12:10,961 --> 02:12:14,920
- Do not be on edge!
- Drag .. drag!

1756
02:12:14,932 --> 02:12:17,867
Will fall .. will fall.

1757
02:12:26,844 --> 02:12:29,813
The handle!

1758
02:12:35,819 --> 02:12:37,878
Come on, move on!

1759
02:12:37,921 --> 02:12:40,890
Find a position!

1760
02:12:43,927 --> 02:12:46,760
Shoot! Shoot!

1761
02:12:48,999 --> 02:12:51,900
Shoot a friend.

1762
02:13:08,919 --> 02:13:11,888
Killing them!

1763
02:13:22,032 --> 02:13:26,025
Come on, come on!

1764
02:13:26,904 --> 02:13:30,806
It's destroying us!

1765
02:13:33,810 --> 02:13:37,007
It's their headquarters. Secure!

1766
02:13:40,918 --> 02:13:43,978
Air aids can not come.

1767
02:13:46,990 --> 02:13:50,983
Good, is not Bee?
Let's go!

1768
02:13:56,900 --> 02:14:00,927
Move to the side! Let's go!

1769
02:14:09,880 --> 02:14:12,815
It's time for action!

1770
02:14:13,984 --> 02:14:18,011
- What are our choices?
- Sneak quietly.

1771
02:14:18,021 --> 02:14:22,788
Or we will be attacked all out.

1772
02:14:22,960 --> 02:14:25,861
We can not move forward.

1773
02:14:25,896 --> 02:14:27,887
We were shot at!

1774
02:14:27,931 --> 02:14:29,865
Back!

1775
02:14:29,866 --> 02:14:34,803
- Where to go?
- I'm fed up with them!

1776
02:14:38,942 --> 02:14:40,000
Squeeze.

1777
02:14:40,010 --> 02:14:45,004
Hey, hey. I need you
to blow up the shooter.

1778
02:14:46,850 --> 02:14:50,809
You are small and nimble, no
will anyone see you coming.

1779
02:14:51,855 --> 02:14:53,982
Blow it up!

1780
02:14:58,929 --> 02:15:05,027
Comrades, change! Kill them!

1781
02:15:08,939 --> 02:15:10,907
I do not have enough
ammunition for that creature.

1782
02:15:10,907 --> 02:15:13,899
Let me take care of it.

1783
02:15:28,992 --> 02:15:31,825
Oh, you will die. Autobot wins!

1784
02:15:31,828 --> 02:15:33,853
Die!

1785
02:15:33,864 --> 02:15:35,889
This is not good, general.
We do not move.

1786
02:15:35,932 --> 02:15:38,765
The plan does not work well, right?

1787
02:15:38,769 --> 02:15:40,828
Better to use physics.

1788
02:15:40,871 --> 02:15:44,898
Okay, I just did a simulation.
That's like a 9 ton tiger.

1789
02:15:44,941 --> 02:15:46,932
Come on, give me an idea, come on.

1790
02:15:46,977 --> 02:15:49,946
Okay, there are roots traveling there.
You should blow it up.

1791
02:15:49,980 --> 02:15:52,005
Use nuclear to blow it up and let it swing  and let gravity do the remaining
_. The room was crumbling,

1792
02:15:52,049 --> 02:15:54,847
The movement of energy
stops, and you're safe.

1793
02:15:54,851 --> 02:15:56,876
Thanks again.

1794
02:15:56,920 --> 02:15:57,978
I need nuclear authority.

1795
02:15:57,988 --> 02:15:59,956
1-XD, we backed down. The task ends.

1796
02:15:59,990 --> 02:16:02,823
We sent a replacement target
to be attacked by Fighter jet.

1797
02:16:02,826 --> 02:16:05,886
Received, we exit.

1798
02:16:05,929 --> 02:16:07,829
I saw it.

1799
02:16:07,831 --> 02:16:09,890
North side.

1800
02:16:09,900 --> 02:16:11,800
3 hours of us.

1801
02:16:11,835 --> 02:16:12,995
Shoot a target for jet attacks.

1802
02:16:13,003 --> 02:16:15,801
They will tear down everything including us.

1803
02:16:15,806 --> 02:16:16,966


1804
02:16:17,007 --> 02:16:18,975
Hey, we're not gonna break
passion to Prime, okay?

1805
02:16:18,975 --> 02:16:21,967
- He's coming. - They just changed
all the plans we can not go inside.

1806
02:16:21,978 --> 02:16:22,910
What?

1807
02:16:22,946 --> 02:16:25,915
This operation is over. If we stay here, we will die.

1808
02:16:25,916 --> 02:16:27,850
- I have to get in there.
- All take your equipment.

1809
02:16:27,851 --> 02:16:29,978
We're gonna go!

1810
02:16:46,036 --> 02:16:47,003
Wait .. wait!

1811
02:16:47,037 --> 02:16:49,904
What the fuck?

1812
02:16:54,845 --> 02:16:56,836
Good work, little friend!

1813
02:16:56,880 --> 02:17:00,816
Go forward, move, fast!

1814
02:17:00,817 --> 02:17:02,785
- Come on, go!
- Let's go!

1815
02:17:02,786 --> 02:17:05,755
We protect you!

1816
02:17:09,025 --> 02:17:11,892
Optimus!

1817
02:17:13,063 --> 02:17:15,964
Yes!

1818
02:17:33,016 --> 02:17:37,885
You are ugly!

1819
02:17:38,955 --> 02:17:43,892
Did you forget who I am?

1820
02:17:52,869 --> 02:17:55,929
I'm Optimus Prime!

1821
02:17:55,939 --> 02:17:59,875
Autobot, attack!

1822
02:18:07,050 --> 02:18:08,915
Where is the target?

1823
02:18:08,952 --> 02:18:11,819
Track! Track!

1824
02:18:11,822 --> 02:18:13,983
- We are waiting for confirmation of the goal.
- Come on!

1825
02:18:13,990 --> 02:18:16,959
Everything, shoot!

1826
02:18:17,060 --> 02:18:17,992
Missable launch!

1827
02:18:17,994 --> 02:18:21,828
Go, go!

1828
02:18:22,899 --> 02:18:26,835
- Come on, go!
- I do not think I can do this.

1829
02:18:26,870 --> 02:18:27,928
9 seconds.

1830
02:18:27,938 --> 02:18:30,873
We're gonna go home, lzzy.

1831
02:18:30,974 --> 02:18:33,772
We have to go!

1832
02:18:33,777 --> 02:18:37,975
- They are everywhere!
- Yes, we will beat them!

1833
02:18:37,981 --> 02:18:41,815
- Good work Lennox, let's work.
- Let's work.

1834
02:18:41,852 --> 02:18:44,013
- Well, we'll do this
together. - Let's begin!

1835
02:18:44,054 --> 02:18:48,957
Come on, hit .. hit!

1836
02:18:54,764 --> 02:18:57,927
Okay, we have to go!
A smart pilot!

1837
02:18:57,934 --> 02:18:59,993
- What are you doing?
- It's just an outpost.

1838
02:19:00,036 --> 02:19:02,834
What?

1839
02:19:03,907 --> 02:19:04,999
Wait!

1840
02:19:05,008 --> 02:19:08,774
Hey, shit!

1841
02:19:23,026 --> 02:19:28,862
- Vivian, come here!
- Yes, my Wembley.

1842
02:19:42,045 --> 02:19:44,980
Hey!

1843
02:19:47,817 --> 02:19:50,012
Please!

1844
02:19:56,826 --> 02:19:59,795
Command, ask for advice. The room
Ignition has been destroyed.

1845
02:19:59,796 --> 02:20:03,857
Repeat, ignition room is destroyed.

1846
02:20:11,074 --> 02:20:16,774
The energy transfer is still
continuing. 50 minutes left.

1847
02:20:16,780 --> 02:20:17,769
Not working!

1848
02:20:17,814 --> 02:20:22,751
Command, it just makes things worse.

1849
02:20:22,786 --> 02:20:24,981
No!

1850
02:20:40,971 --> 02:20:43,997
Follow me, I will guide the way.

1851
02:20:47,944 --> 02:20:51,846
- Okay, that's it!
- Not this time!

1852
02:20:51,848 --> 02:20:53,907
Okay, go!

1853
02:21:05,929 --> 02:21:07,954
Beware!

1854
02:21:11,001 --> 02:21:12,969
Time to die!

1855
02:21:12,969 --> 02:21:14,994
I'll blow your head, Megatron!

1856
02:21:15,038 --> 02:21:18,838
Death now, bubble head!

1857
02:21:33,957 --> 02:21:37,893
Megatron, kill them!

1858
02:21:48,938 --> 02:21:51,771
We used to be brothers.

1859
02:21:51,775 --> 02:21:54,005
First.

1860
02:22:19,803 --> 02:22:21,771
Oh, wait for us.

1861
02:22:21,771 --> 02:22:24,865
Wait for us.

1862
02:22:28,044 --> 02:22:31,013
- Hold my hand!
- Yes!

1863
02:22:41,991 --> 02:22:44,858
Do not let go!

1864
02:22:48,798 --> 02:22:51,961
Quintessa, you have no ethics!

1865
02:22:51,968 --> 02:22:55,836
Nemesis, betrayal base!

1866
02:22:58,842 --> 02:23:04,041
Greet my friend, Bumble Bee!

1867
02:23:09,052 --> 02:23:13,785
I stung like a bee.

1868
02:23:21,865 --> 02:23:25,801
Yes!

1869
02:23:28,838 --> 02:23:32,001
You will not die. I
will save you.

1870
02:23:36,846 --> 02:23:38,973
It's not the time

1871
02:24:47,884 --> 02:24:50,045
This is real.

1872
02:24:54,057 --> 02:24:57,026
After all the legends.

1873
02:24:57,026 --> 02:24:59,927
Everything is correct.

1874
02:25:00,863 --> 02:25:04,026
That some brave souls are united ..

1875
02:25:04,067 --> 02:25:07,036
to save this world.

1876
02:25:07,036 --> 02:25:11,803
We can be our
_ heroes in our lives.

1877
02:25:11,808 --> 02:25:16,871
We all, if we
have the courage ..

1878
02:25:16,879 --> 02:25:20,007
to try.

1879
02:25:21,050 --> 02:25:24,918
Destiny can always be changed.

1880
02:25:24,954 --> 02:25:29,982
But now our world
merges into one.

1881
02:25:30,026 --> 02:25:33,757
We must improve our planet.

1882
02:25:33,796 --> 02:25:38,859
Work together, if
we want to survive.

1883
02:25:38,868 --> 02:25:41,803
The crazy family, huh?

1884
02:25:42,839 --> 02:25:44,807
You've done great things.

1885
02:25:44,841 --> 02:25:46,934
Absolutely incredible.

1886
02:25:47,844 --> 02:25:52,804
A dangerous secret
hidden deep within the earth.

1887
02:25:52,815 --> 02:25:57,775
Where there are many more on this planet
, than it looks.

1888
02:25:57,787 --> 02:26:00,051
I'm Optimus Prime.

1889
02:26:00,056 --> 02:26:03,856
Calling all Autobots.

1890
02:26:03,893 --> 02:26:09,854
It's time to go home.

1891
02:26:58,915 --> 02:27:01,782
Are you lost?

1892
02:27:04,020 --> 02:27:06,887
I will not do that.

1893
02:27:06,889 --> 02:27:09,858
Do not touch him.

1894
02:27:09,859 --> 02:27:11,986
He does not like that.

1895
02:27:12,028 --> 02:27:14,963
Who does not like what?

1896
02:27:14,997 --> 02:27:17,864
Unicorn.

1897
02:27:17,900 --> 02:27:21,859
But I can show
how to kill it.
