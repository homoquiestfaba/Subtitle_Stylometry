No.

[speaking Japanese]

39
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,083
[in Japanese] So you speak Japanese?

40
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:08,666
Of course.

41
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,166
You didn't say so.

42
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,166
I wasn't asked.

43
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,958
- Why was I not told she's a translator?
- Sorry, I didn't know.

I understand everything.

47
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:27,000
I want you to tell me about the night
Lily Bridges disappeared.

48
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:30,416
From what we can tell,
you were the last person she spoke to.

49
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,916
We spoke for a minute or so.

50
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:36,041
She left.

51
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,333
So, I went back inside.

52
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,708
Not according to your neighbor.

53
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:45,791
She said a few minutes later, you left
your apartment without an umbrella.

54
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:47,208
I did.

55
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:51,083
So, it wasn't the last time
that you saw her?

56
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,833
- I didn't catch up with her.
- Why did you follow her?

57
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:57,208
She had something of mine.
I wanted it back.

58
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,291
- What was it?
- My coat.

59
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,708
So you spoke to her again?

60
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,875
No. I said I didn't find her.

61
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:08,375
You assumed she was going to the station?

62
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,791
- Is that strange?
- And you never saw her again?

63
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,166
Answer me!

64
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,500

Five years and two months.

68
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,708
You have family here?

No, just me.

71
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,375
He's an electrician.

72
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,958
Brothers and sisters?

73
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,291
Seven brothers.

74
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:36,875
Six, actually.

75
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,250
One of them died.

76
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,500
- You are unmarried, of course.
- Of course.

77
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,500
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- No.

78
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:48,958
Are you sure?

79
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:51,666
Absolutely positive.

Shouldn't you ask permission?

83
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,125
I never ask.

84
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,625
Why not?

85
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,500
You lose the shot.

86
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:41,541
Don't people get annoyed?

87
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,166
I don't photograph people.

88
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,166
What do you take pictures of then?

89
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:50,916

That kind of thing.

93
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,583
But... you photographed me.

00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:05,375

What kind of camera is that?

101
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:48,916
Olympus OM-1.

102
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,875
Hm.

103
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:52,958
It has a Zuiko lens, 50mm.

104
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,958
- Very fast.
- Interesting.

105
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,125
Is it?

106
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,375
- [slurps]
- Not really.

107
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,583
Just trying to make conversation.

108
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:07,958
Why?

109
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,083
Because that's what normal people do.

110
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,083
- But you are not normal.
- Neither are you.

111
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,666
So let's not pretend to be.

112
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:17,750
Okay.

113
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:21,833
Let's just be honest with each other
from the beginning.

114
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:25,375
All day long, I watch people talk,

115
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:29,083
saying all kinds of things without saying
what they are really thinking.

116
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:32,250
Right.

117
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:34,791
So...

118
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,375
what are you really thinking?

119
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,208
Tell me everything.

120
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:45,458
Everything?

121
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,708
I dare you.

122
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:55,458
Okay.

123
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:05,000
Well, the noodles are too hot,
and the broth is too salty.

124
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:09,750
This is the strangest date
I've ever been on, if it's even a date.

125
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:12,666
I probably shouldn't trust a stranger
that I've just met,

126
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,166
and I should probably leave.

127
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:17,416
Why don't you?

128
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:24,958
Because I'm attracted to you.

129
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
A little.

130
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,083
That's good.

131
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:34,458
Good.

132
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,458
Now, you be honest with me.

133
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:40,958
I will.

134
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,333
What are you thinking?

135
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,541
I want to photograph you.

136
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,500
You've already done that. What else?

137
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,125
That is all I'm thinking.

This place is incredible.

141
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:38,791
Thank you.

142
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,166
Do you live here alone?

143
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,833
Yes. Not many people have been here.

144
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:45,625
Oh.

145
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,083
Wait here.

146
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,250
I'll be right back.

147
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,041
Where do you want me to stand?

148
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:25,208
Anywhere.

149
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,000
What do you want me to do?

150
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:30,958
Anything.

151
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,250
I've never had my picture taken before.

152
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,833
Not properly.

153
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,791

Thank God.

162
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:40,708
You hear that?

163
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,000
Only after earthquakes...

164
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:47,666
you hear it.

165
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,166
[faint whistling]

166
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,125
Yeah.

167
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,666
Yeah, I do. What is it?

[woman in Japanese] A friend of mine
is organizing a special event

171
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,166
for the Tanabata Festival
and asked us to perform.

172
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,166
But that only gives us two months.

173
00:14:56,708 --> 00:15:00,416
Maybe if we could practice twice a week,
we could do it.

174
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,791
Exactly.

175
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,416
- Let's try.

Really?

It's just a little something...

I've been working on.

182
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:17,916
Thank you so much.

- [in English] Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

I cultivate them myself.

185
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,666
I don't normally give them away.

00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,708
[Oguchi scoffs]

367
00:29:17,583 --> 00:29:20,000
[in English] I don't understand how
anyone finds anything

368
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:21,666
if none of the streets have names.

369
00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:24,958
I guess I'm just gonna
have to learn numbers.

370
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:28,458
- [in Japanese] Good morning.
- Good morning.

371
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:29,875
[continues in Japanese]

372
00:29:29,958 --> 00:29:31,125
[in English] Thank you.

373
00:29:32,166 --> 00:29:36,083
Oh, I love this one! It's so Japanese.

374
00:29:36,958 --> 00:29:38,708
I think I had a dream
about a place like this,

375
00:29:38,791 --> 00:29:40,625
but in my dream it was a tree house.

376
00:29:42,375 --> 00:29:43,333
It's perfect.

377
00:29:44,458 --> 00:29:46,708
- The kitchen's small.
- I don't cook.

378
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:48,625
How did I know that?

379
00:29:50,125 --> 00:29:52,833
Well, I guess the only real downside
is that it's an old building,

380
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:55,500
so in case of an earthquake...

381
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,166
I don't care.
I mean, it's lasted this long.

382
00:29:58,791 --> 00:29:59,666
True.

383
00:30:00,083 --> 00:30:01,500
Let's put in an application.

384
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:03,000
Okay.

385
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:04,333
Will you tell her for me?

386
00:30:06,166 --> 00:30:07,041
Of course.

387
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:12,000
[Lily] Look.

388
00:30:18,916 --> 00:30:21,791
[Lily] It's weird how everyone
stares at you in Japan.

389
00:30:21,875 --> 00:30:23,125
It's like being famous.

390
00:30:23,791 --> 00:30:25,750
[Lucy]
Yes. Some people get addicted to that.

391
00:30:25,833 --> 00:30:26,958
Like Bob?

392
00:30:27,541 --> 00:30:28,541
Like Bob.

393
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:31,375
He's kind of sexy, though, isn't he?

394
00:30:31,458 --> 00:30:34,250
I don't see him that way. Nope.

395
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,000
Do you have a boyfriend?

396
00:30:37,458 --> 00:30:38,375
I do.

397
00:30:39,666 --> 00:30:40,666
What's his name?

398
00:30:42,666 --> 00:30:44,000
His name is Teiji.

399
00:30:46,041 --> 00:30:47,083
Teiji.

400
00:30:49,541 --> 00:30:51,041
This looks good, the contract.

401
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:52,000
Um...

402
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:55,000
I can ask one of the lawyers at Sasagawa
to double-check it.

403
00:30:55,083 --> 00:30:57,750
Thanks. I'm so impressed
you can even read that.

404
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,291
[waitress in Japanese]
I can take your order if you're ready.

405
00:31:01,375 --> 00:31:03,000
[in English] Will you order me a coffee?

406
00:31:03,875 --> 00:31:05,541
- [in Japanese] Just a moment, please.
- Okay.

407
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:09,083
[in English]
You have to be able to order for yourself.

408
00:31:09,166 --> 00:31:12,291
How are you gonna survive
if you can't ask for anything?

409
00:31:13,166 --> 00:31:14,041
I don't know.

410
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:18,875
If you want a coffee, you say,
<i>"Koohii o hitotsu,"</i>

411
00:31:18,958 --> 00:31:21,333
which means one,
<i>"kudasai," </i>which means please.

412
00:31:21,875 --> 00:31:23,375
[in Japanese] <i>Koohii o...</i>

413
00:31:23,458 --> 00:31:25,750
<i>- hitotsu...
- Hitotsu kudasai.</i>

414
00:31:26,416 --> 00:31:27,375
<i>Kudasai.</i>

415
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,500
[in English] That's it.

416
00:31:31,916 --> 00:31:33,166
- [in Japanese] Excuse me.
- Yes.

417
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,833
<i>Koohii o hitotsu kudasai.</i>

418
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:36,625
What would you like?

419
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,875
<i>Koohii o hitotsu kudasai.</i>

420
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:41,333
Okay.

421
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:44,000
- Me too.
- Okay.

422
00:31:45,583 --> 00:31:47,541
[in English]
That's crazy that she understood that.

423
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,375
[both laugh]

424
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,958
[indistinct chatter]

425
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
[in Japanese] Look.

426
00:32:30,958 --> 00:32:33,833
The light, the shadow,
everything exactly right.

427
00:32:33,916 --> 00:32:34,916
Hm.

428
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,291
[in English]
When did you start photography?

429
00:32:42,458 --> 00:32:43,750
[in Japanese] At school.

430
00:32:46,708 --> 00:32:48,166
I was always in the darkroom.

431
00:32:50,291 --> 00:32:53,166
There was an old teacher,
Mr. Hyakutake, who taught me.

432
00:32:55,083 --> 00:32:57,458
There were about a dozen people
in the photography club,

433
00:32:57,541 --> 00:32:59,875
but eventually, they all left,
and there was only me.

434
00:33:01,083 --> 00:33:03,000
[in English] I read once that when...

435
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:05,833
the Westerners arrived
in 19th century Japan,

436
00:33:05,916 --> 00:33:08,500
they wanted to photograph
the locals, but...

437
00:33:09,375 --> 00:33:10,583
they wouldn't let them.

438
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:14,041
They thought it would steal their soul.

439
00:33:14,541 --> 00:33:15,833
[in Japanese] I understand that.

440
00:33:16,708 --> 00:33:18,166
The subject always gives something,

441
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,458
some part of themselves,
to the photographer.

442
00:33:23,958 --> 00:33:28,291
If every time I took a photo
it took a piece of your soul...

443
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:31,791
would you still let me?

444
00:33:36,208 --> 00:33:38,416
[in English] I think you know the answer
to that question.

445
00:33:41,375 --> 00:33:42,458
[chuckles]

446
00:33:45,583 --> 00:33:47,000
[in Japanese] I will put these away.

447
00:33:48,833 --> 00:33:50,333
[in English] You gonna lock them away?

448
00:33:50,416 --> 00:33:51,291
Yes.

449
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:52,958
What else do you have in there?

450
00:34:00,333 --> 00:34:02,083
[sound of key opening lock]

451
00:34:10,416 --> 00:34:13,583
[Bob] Didn't Teiji wanna come today?
I've gotta meet him one of these days.

452
00:34:13,666 --> 00:34:15,500
- [Lucy] You will.
- You two getting on well?

453
00:34:15,583 --> 00:34:17,166
[Lucy] Yeah. Great.

454
00:34:17,916 --> 00:34:19,125
[Bob] Tell me more.

455
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:23,041
[Lucy] Well, I guess we're both a bit odd,
but we fit well together.

456
00:34:23,708 --> 00:34:25,458
[Bob] Sounds kinky. [laughs]

457
00:34:25,541 --> 00:34:26,458
[Lucy] Shut up.

458
00:34:26,541 --> 00:34:28,833
Oh, so the band's playing
another gig next week.

459
00:34:28,916 --> 00:34:30,458
At the Downbeat Club in Ikebukuro.

460
00:34:30,541 --> 00:34:32,291
- That's good.
- Yeah.

461
00:34:32,375 --> 00:34:33,583
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

462
00:34:34,791 --> 00:34:37,291
Yeah, these musicians,
they are the best I've ever played with.

463
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,625
I used to have a couple of bands
back in England,

464
00:34:39,708 --> 00:34:41,541
but, you know,
there's so much negativity there.

465
00:34:41,625 --> 00:34:42,583
Yeah.

466
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:46,250
I think that's what I like most
about Japan.

467
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:47,833
It gives you a second chance.

468
00:34:51,708 --> 00:34:53,625
[Bob] Oh, my goodness. Look at that.

469
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:55,125
Wow!

470
00:34:55,208 --> 00:34:57,666
- [Lucy] It's so beautiful.
- [Natsuko] Stunning.

471
00:34:58,625 --> 00:34:59,833
[Lucy] I love Japan.

472
00:35:00,958 --> 00:35:02,958
- [Bob] Did anyone bring a camera?
- [Natsuko] Not me.

473
00:35:03,041 --> 00:35:04,041
- [Lucy] Not me.
- [Lily] No.

474
00:35:06,166 --> 00:35:09,625
- [Lucy] What about... "good morning"?
- [Lily] <i>Ohayo gozaimasu.</i>

475
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:10,875
[Lucy] And then...

476
00:35:11,458 --> 00:35:12,666
"How are you?"

477
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,333
[Lily] <i>Gen-ji?</i>

478
00:35:14,791 --> 00:35:17,291
<i>Gen-ki... desu-ka.</i>

479
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:21,125
Uh... And then if you meet someone
for the first time, you just say,

480
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:24,833
<i>- "Yoroshiku onegaishimasu."</i>
- Oh, my God.

481
00:35:24,916 --> 00:35:26,500
- Just... Ah!
- Oh, shit.

482
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,000
- Oh!
- Okay, sit down.

483
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:29,958
No, no, I'm...

484
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:30,958
- Sit down.
- Ah!

485
00:35:31,916 --> 00:35:32,833
Ah!

486
00:35:34,458 --> 00:35:35,625
[grunts]

487
00:35:36,958 --> 00:35:39,000
- I'm gonna take your shoe off.
- What?

488
00:35:40,791 --> 00:35:42,458
- Does this hurt?
- [grunts]

489
00:35:43,125 --> 00:35:44,125
Push on my hand.

490
00:35:44,833 --> 00:35:45,833
[grunts]

491
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,208
It's not broken. Probably sprained.

492
00:35:48,291 --> 00:35:49,166
[Bob] What happened?

493
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:53,041
[grunts]
I fell on this, and Lily's playing nurse.

494
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:55,375
I'm not playing. I used to work
at George Washington Hospital.

495
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:56,458
I am a nurse.

496
00:35:56,541 --> 00:35:57,750
[scoffs] Really?

497
00:35:58,291 --> 00:36:00,166
Yeah, I wasn't always a bartender.

498
00:36:26,291 --> 00:36:29,041
- [Bob] Why don't you come in here?
- [Lily] I'm going to go in with Lucy.

499
00:36:30,208 --> 00:36:31,541
Maybe later, though.

500
00:36:48,583 --> 00:36:49,791
[Lily] How's your ankle?

501
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:52,833
It's better.

502
00:37:02,208 --> 00:37:03,958
You think Teiji would like it here?

503
00:37:04,666 --> 00:37:05,875
Yeah, I think so.

504
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:07,375
He loves the water and...

505
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:10,291
reflections.
He would photograph everything.

506
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,416
I love taking photographs,
but I'm not very good.

507
00:37:16,833 --> 00:37:19,375
- Does he sell his pictures?
- I don't think so.

508
00:37:21,625 --> 00:37:22,958
But... I don't know.

509
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:25,875
Well, what does he do with them?

510
00:37:27,125 --> 00:37:28,375
I'm not sure.

511
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:29,458
[chuckles]

512
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:32,666
I wish I could meet him.

513
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,333
Why don't you and I go down
to the noodle shop one night?

514
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,500
- I don't know.
- Come on, it'll be fun.

515
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:48,208
[laughs]

516
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,416
Yeah, sure.

517
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,916
Teiji, I was wondering...

518
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:08,250
why don't you do something
with your photographs?

519
00:38:10,041 --> 00:38:13,166
I mean, not the ones of me,
of course, but...

520
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,875
the ones of the city. They're really good.

521
00:38:15,958 --> 00:38:17,875
- [Teiji] I don't want to.
- Really?

522
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,166
I mean...

523
00:38:21,916 --> 00:38:24,333
- why are you taking them?
- I'm collecting them.

524
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:26,041
For what?

525
00:38:27,291 --> 00:38:28,375
My collection.

526
00:38:31,875 --> 00:38:33,250
You can have an exhibition.

527
00:38:34,208 --> 00:38:36,875
Or put them in a book,
let people see them.

528
00:38:36,958 --> 00:38:38,750
Why does it matter to you so much?

529
00:38:39,916 --> 00:38:40,875
I'm sorry.

530
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:45,083
[in Japanese] I've got to go to work.

531
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,541
[distant chatter and laughter]

532
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:16,208
[in Japanese] Will I see you this weekend?

533
00:39:16,291 --> 00:39:17,375
I have to work.

534
00:39:18,166 --> 00:39:20,750
- Um... Yes, but...
- I will call you.

535
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,958
[in English] Okay.

536
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:25,041
Bye.

537
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:30,083
[cabinet rattles]

538
00:42:01,833 --> 00:42:02,875
[faint creaking]

[exhales]

541
00:42:34,458 --> 00:42:35,375
What are you doing?

542
00:42:36,541 --> 00:42:37,583
I'm sorry.

543
00:42:40,833 --> 00:42:41,875
They are private.

544
00:42:42,875 --> 00:42:44,166
Are you spying on me?

545
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:46,125
Why did you do this?

546
00:42:55,125 --> 00:42:56,041
Who is she?

547
00:42:56,125 --> 00:42:58,041
[key rattles in lock]

548
00:43:00,916 --> 00:43:02,250
Her name is Sachi.

549
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:06,166
Were you together?

550
00:43:06,708 --> 00:43:08,750
Yes. I must get back to work.

551
00:43:10,583 --> 00:43:11,708
Where is she now?

552
00:43:13,208 --> 00:43:14,875
I don't know. She's gone.

553
00:43:16,541 --> 00:43:17,583
Just "gone?"

554
00:43:19,166 --> 00:43:22,666
[in Japanese] We finished.
She left. I didn't try to find her.

555
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:25,833
When I found you,
I stopped thinking of Sachi.

556
00:43:25,916 --> 00:43:29,750
I'm sorry. Please forget I ever did this.

557
00:43:29,833 --> 00:43:31,833
- I have to get back.
- Hold me.

558
00:43:37,375 --> 00:43:38,916
[in English] I shouldn't have done that.

559
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,500
It's just that I think about you
all the time, every moment.

560
00:43:41,958 --> 00:43:45,375
- I wanted to know more about you.
- That's not the way to find out.

561
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:47,166
I know.

562
00:43:48,166 --> 00:43:49,375
You must trust me.

563
00:43:51,083 --> 00:43:51,958
I will.

[camera shutter clicks]

570
00:44:29,666 --> 00:44:33,333
I just got a letter from my mom,
and it took eight days to get here.

571
00:44:33,833 --> 00:44:34,708
I know.

572
00:44:35,583 --> 00:44:37,291
That's fast, actually.

573
00:44:38,625 --> 00:44:39,875
And the phones!

574
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,833
I called my girlfriend
and we talked for, like, 20 minutes.

575
00:44:42,916 --> 00:44:44,791
And it cost over a hundred bucks.

576
00:44:46,125 --> 00:44:47,750
I find it better not to call.

577
00:44:49,875 --> 00:44:51,291
I like being cut off.

578
00:44:51,791 --> 00:44:52,666
It's great.

579
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,208
Do you miss your family?

580
00:44:56,666 --> 00:44:57,541
Nope.

581
00:45:00,125 --> 00:45:01,208
How are the noodles?

582
00:45:02,375 --> 00:45:04,125
- Awesome.
- Delicious.

583
00:45:04,875 --> 00:45:06,375
I'm finishing work soon.

584
00:45:06,916 --> 00:45:08,250
Do you wanna go somewhere?

585
00:45:09,625 --> 00:45:12,791
It's getting late.
I think Lily wants to go home.

586
00:45:12,875 --> 00:45:14,666
Are you kidding? I'd love to.

587
00:45:15,625 --> 00:45:16,625
[Lily] Can we go?

588
00:45:18,166 --> 00:45:19,125
Please?

589
00:45:24,791 --> 00:45:25,666
Sure.

590
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:27,375
- [Lily] Awesome.
- Yeah.

591
00:45:27,833 --> 00:45:28,750
Good.

592
00:45:33,458 --> 00:45:35,666
Oh, my God. He's so cute!

593
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:37,208
Cute?

594
00:45:37,833 --> 00:45:40,458
He's not cute. Kittens are cute.

595
00:45:40,541 --> 00:45:42,958
Okay, whatever, he's gorgeous.
And he's so tall.

596
00:45:43,041 --> 00:45:45,041
I thought Japanese guys
were supposed to be short.

597
00:45:45,791 --> 00:45:48,916
That's bullshit. That's just a stereotype.

[doorbell rings]

607
00:46:55,333 --> 00:46:57,291
[Lily] Hey! I was just in the area.

608
00:46:57,375 --> 00:46:59,791
- Hey!
- I don't wanna bother you if Teiji's here.

609
00:47:01,291 --> 00:47:03,166
- He doesn't come here.
- I brought whiskey.

610
00:47:03,875 --> 00:47:05,750
Your house is so nice.

611
00:47:06,291 --> 00:47:08,166
It's so much nicer than mine.

612
00:47:08,583 --> 00:47:11,166
- No tree, though.
- No, no tree.

613
00:47:13,041 --> 00:47:15,541
You don't have any pictures
of Teiji anywhere.

614
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:17,791
He doesn't like having his picture taken.

615
00:47:17,875 --> 00:47:20,041
It was really great meeting him
the other night.

616
00:47:20,875 --> 00:47:22,500
He's, like, obsessed with you.

617
00:47:23,541 --> 00:47:26,250
- Why do you say that?
- 'Cause I can tell. I know men.

618
00:47:28,333 --> 00:47:29,333
[soft chuckle]

619
00:47:30,291 --> 00:47:31,583
What star sign are you?

620
00:47:33,291 --> 00:47:34,875
I don't believe in all of that.

621
00:47:35,541 --> 00:47:36,500
Why?

622
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:41,416
My personality is a combination
of my genes,

623
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:45,000
my upbringing, my parents, my school.
Nothing to do with the stars.

624
00:47:46,208 --> 00:47:47,083
Hm...

625
00:47:48,666 --> 00:47:49,583
Taurus?

626
00:47:52,666 --> 00:47:54,000
You came to my birthday.

627
00:47:54,083 --> 00:47:55,291
[both laugh]

628
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:58,708
Yeah, but I can also just tell.

629
00:47:59,666 --> 00:48:00,958
I can read palms, too.

630
00:48:02,583 --> 00:48:03,833
And tarot cards.

631
00:48:06,041 --> 00:48:07,041
Really?

632
00:48:07,125 --> 00:48:09,708
Sometimes, at the bar, I have to be
careful when I'm getting people's change

633
00:48:09,791 --> 00:48:12,208
not to look at their hands
'cause I see things.

634
00:48:13,875 --> 00:48:15,000
Right.

635
00:48:15,083 --> 00:48:16,125
I do, for real.

636
00:48:21,958 --> 00:48:23,583
Go on, then. [clears throat]

637
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,500
In the past, there's like a...

638
00:48:35,916 --> 00:48:37,458
emptiness or, like, a...

639
00:48:38,083 --> 00:48:39,250
silence.

640
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:42,375
And then you have
these three breaks in the line.

641
00:48:44,541 --> 00:48:47,208
There's one early on,
then another, and then a third.

642
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,166
What do they mean?

643
00:48:54,208 --> 00:48:55,458
[Lily] Hm.

644
00:48:55,541 --> 00:48:56,833
Abrupt change.

645
00:48:57,666 --> 00:48:58,833
Accidents.

646
00:49:00,875 --> 00:49:01,875
Death.

647
00:49:08,708 --> 00:49:09,583
What else?

648
00:49:12,708 --> 00:49:14,416
What do you see about the future?

649
00:49:18,458 --> 00:49:19,625
You mean, like, Teiji?

650
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:21,583
Mm-hm.

651
00:49:26,833 --> 00:49:28,708
It's really complicated. I can't read it.

652
00:49:32,916 --> 00:49:33,833
Come on.

653
00:49:34,791 --> 00:49:35,708
Sorry.

654
00:49:36,708 --> 00:49:38,416
You clearly reacted to something.

655
00:49:39,041 --> 00:49:42,041
[sighs] Well, it's like a window that
opens up and then I can see things.

656
00:49:42,125 --> 00:49:45,333
And then it fogs up and then
I can't really be sure of anything.

657
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,500
- I didn't mean to freak you out.
- I'm not freaked out.

658
00:49:55,208 --> 00:49:56,583
- Want some whiskey?
- Mm-hm.

659
00:49:59,375 --> 00:50:00,250
Definitely.

00:50:25,666 --> 00:50:27,291

- I think so.

663

[rumbling begins again]

664
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,000

[exhales]

666
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:37,875
- I think it stopped.
- Yeah, I think it did.

[bird sings]

668
00:50:43,291 --> 00:50:44,416
Do you hear that?

669
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:47,625
I'm not sure.

670
00:50:54,708 --> 00:50:56,083
It's the earthquake bird.

671
00:50:59,208 --> 00:51:00,708
It's what Teiji calls it.

672
00:51:02,875 --> 00:51:04,833
Always sings after an earthquake.

673
00:51:04,916 --> 00:51:07,458
[bird still singing]

674
00:51:07,541 --> 00:51:08,541
Oh, yeah.

675
00:51:10,958 --> 00:51:12,000
I hear it.

676
00:51:15,458 --> 00:51:16,500
It's beautiful.

677
00:51:22,875 --> 00:51:24,208
Let's go back to sleep.

678
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,125
[light switch clicks]

[music plays quietly on radio]

681
00:51:53,958 --> 00:51:55,125
I don't need tea.

682
00:51:56,833 --> 00:51:58,625
Just trying to wake myself up.

683
00:51:59,041 --> 00:52:00,916
I had a great night's sleep.

684
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,416
Except for the earthquake.

685
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:03,875
Really?

686
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:06,958
Couldn't have been a big one.
I must've slept through it.

687
00:52:10,958 --> 00:52:12,458
No, we were both awake.

688
00:52:13,291 --> 00:52:14,208
Weird.

689
00:52:14,875 --> 00:52:15,916
I don't remember.

690
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,041
It looks like it's going to rain.
Can I borrow a coat?

691
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:25,125
Sure.

692
00:52:26,125 --> 00:52:27,000
It's in there.

693
00:52:27,458 --> 00:52:28,375
The closet.

694
00:52:33,958 --> 00:52:36,916
I was wondering, do you want to go
to Sado Island with me?

695
00:52:37,625 --> 00:52:40,375
Katoh-san, my friend,
she's in the string quartet.

696
00:52:40,458 --> 00:52:44,291
She's from there, and she says
it's like time traveling into the past.

697
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:45,625
When?

698
00:52:47,416 --> 00:52:48,833
The weekend after next.

699
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:52,208
It's an arts and culture festival...

700
00:52:52,291 --> 00:52:53,916
Won't you be going with Teiji?

701
00:52:55,875 --> 00:52:58,166
If he can get off work, yes.

702
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:01,708
I have to think about it, because Bob
invited me to some concert that he's...

703
00:53:01,791 --> 00:53:02,750
Not that one.

704
00:53:03,916 --> 00:53:05,458
Oh. Sorry.

705
00:53:06,125 --> 00:53:07,166
No, take it.

706
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,250
I just need it back.

707
00:53:10,666 --> 00:53:11,583
Okay.

708
00:53:12,333 --> 00:53:14,250
Thank you. I'll take care of it.

let's not take any more photos today.

713
00:53:36,125 --> 00:53:37,000
Why?

714
00:53:37,958 --> 00:53:39,000
I'm tired of it.

715
00:53:41,833 --> 00:53:44,333
- Okay.
- No, I mean, we could take some more.

716
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:49,083
- I'm sorry.
- No.

717
00:53:50,125 --> 00:53:51,500
Not when you don't want to.

[Teiji pours drink]

Did you used to go out

897
01:09:27,332 --> 01:09:29,666
Just try and lay down. It's okay.

898
01:09:30,082 --> 01:09:31,082
Put your head down.

899
01:09:33,541 --> 01:09:34,875
It's going to be okay.

900
01:09:54,250 --> 01:09:55,916
[shouting]

901
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,333

[music playing]

905
01:11:20,750 --> 01:11:22,333
[drums beating]

906
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:57,958
[Lily] Lucy!

907
01:11:58,541 --> 01:11:59,583
There you are.

908
01:12:00,416 --> 01:12:02,833
You left me on a fucking cliff top.

909
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:06,416
- Your shirt.
- Thank you.

910
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:07,958
- Did you get our note?
- Note?

911
01:12:08,041 --> 01:12:11,083
Yeah. We left you a note under a rock,
by the shirt, saying we were coming here,

912
01:12:11,166 --> 01:12:12,958
and if you didn't come here,
we'd come back for you.

913
01:12:13,041 --> 01:12:15,708
No, I didn't see a note just lying around.

914
01:12:15,791 --> 01:12:18,250
- Oh. Well, it must've blown away.
- [Lucy scoffs] Right.

915
01:12:18,333 --> 01:12:22,333
Yeah, maybe. Maybe we're all just gonna
blow away off the edge of the world.

916
01:12:23,541 --> 01:12:24,875
Are you still feeling sick?

917
01:12:25,250 --> 01:12:28,125
You might have a virus, or it could be
that fish eye you had for breakfast.

918
01:12:28,208 --> 01:12:29,791
I've got pills at the hotel.
Why don't we go back?

919
01:12:29,875 --> 01:12:31,583
- I don't need your pills.
- I'm just trying to help.

920
01:12:31,666 --> 01:12:32,625
Yeah, I'm sure.

921
01:12:32,708 --> 01:12:35,708
- Lucy, you're not making any sense.
- I know what I'm feeling.

922
01:12:36,708 --> 01:12:39,750
And what I'm feeling isn't right.
It's not right at all.

923
01:12:39,833 --> 01:12:40,833
[Teiji] Lucy.

924
01:12:41,291 --> 01:12:43,333
- [in Japanese] We are sorry.
- "We?"

925
01:12:45,583 --> 01:12:46,958
What are you talking about?

926
01:12:49,750 --> 01:12:51,208
[panting]

927
01:12:56,291 --> 01:12:58,416

[breathing heavily]

930
01:13:27,875 --> 01:13:29,416
- [gasps]
- [in English] Come with me.

931
01:13:39,458 --> 01:13:41,291
[birds chirping softly]

932

[camera shutter clicks]

935
01:14:46,958 --> 01:14:49,000
It's like nature is taking it back.

936
01:14:51,666 --> 01:14:52,583
Yes.

937
01:14:53,791 --> 01:14:55,125
A place of healing.

938
01:14:57,166 --> 01:14:58,208
I hope so.

939
01:15:16,541 --> 01:15:17,875
I really like you.

940
01:15:21,041 --> 01:15:22,083
My Lucy.

941
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,250
[Lucy breathes deeply]

942
01:15:43,541 --> 01:15:45,416
[birds cry]

943
01:15:51,541 --> 01:15:53,541
[indistinct chatter]

944
01:15:58,458 --> 01:15:59,375
Bye.

945
01:16:02,458 --> 01:16:03,750
- Bye.
- Bye.

946
01:16:03,833 --> 01:16:04,750
Bye, Lily.

947
01:16:21,916 --> 01:16:22,791
[chuckles]

948
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:41,916

950
01:16:51,958 --> 01:16:53,875
- [breathing heavily]
- [camera shutter clicks]

951
01:17:02,541 --> 01:17:03,916
[in Japanese] I did it.

952
01:17:06,583 --> 01:17:09,208
I killed Lily Bridges.

953
01:17:13,916 --> 01:17:14,875
How did you kill her?

954
01:17:17,375 --> 01:17:18,583
Tell me! How did you kill her?

955
01:17:19,666 --> 01:17:21,000
I smashed her head in.

956
01:17:21,875 --> 01:17:22,875
With what?

957
01:17:25,208 --> 01:17:26,166
A brick.

958
01:17:30,125 --> 01:17:33,041
It is good you are talking now.

959
01:17:34,041 --> 01:17:35,333
Tell me why you did it.

960
01:17:35,791 --> 01:17:39,291
It's best to give us
as much information as possible.

961
01:17:40,125 --> 01:17:41,458
Best for you, I'm sure.

962
01:17:43,750 --> 01:17:45,291
All you need to know is

963
01:17:45,791 --> 01:17:47,666
I am guilty.

964
01:17:51,375 --> 01:17:52,541
[woman speaking on TV]

965
01:17:52,625 --> 01:17:54,791

972
01:18:12,416 --> 01:18:13,750
<i>I need to talk to you.</i>

973

[doorbell ringing]

978
01:18:48,375 --> 01:18:49,875
Lucy, what's going on?

979
01:18:50,625 --> 01:18:53,125
- Are you sick?
- I'm not feeling very well.

980
01:18:55,125 --> 01:18:56,583
I'll be fine in a day or two.

981
01:18:57,291 --> 01:18:58,416
I brought these.

982
01:19:04,958 --> 01:19:07,125
Is there something you need to talk about?

983
01:19:07,625 --> 01:19:08,583
No.

984
01:19:12,375 --> 01:19:14,291
Well, what should I tell them at work?

985
01:19:14,958 --> 01:19:17,458
You can tell them anything. I'm quitting.

986
01:19:18,208 --> 01:19:19,208
Quitting?

987
01:19:19,708 --> 01:19:21,458
Lucy, what are you talking about?

988
01:19:23,375 --> 01:19:24,500
Leave me, Natsuko.

989
01:19:25,250 --> 01:19:26,125
I'm worried about you.

990
01:19:26,208 --> 01:19:27,708
Just leave me, Natsuko!

991
01:20:25,875 --> 01:20:27,083
[indistinct chatter]

992
01:20:35,833 --> 01:20:37,375

01:20:48,083 --> 01:20:49,583
[doorbell rings]

995
01:21:00,625 --> 01:21:01,625
Can I come in?

996
01:21:06,125 --> 01:21:07,875
I know I fucked up and I'm sorry.

997
01:21:10,125 --> 01:21:11,375
Do you love him?

998
01:21:11,458 --> 01:21:15,500
I don't know. Kind of.
It's kind of driving me crazy, you know?

999
01:21:17,416 --> 01:21:19,250
I invited you to Sado Island.

1000
01:21:19,333 --> 01:21:21,833
I was the one who introduced you
in the first place.

1001
01:21:21,916 --> 01:21:24,083
I know you're angry,
and this isn't an excuse,

1002
01:21:24,166 --> 01:21:26,958
but maybe there's a bigger reason
for all of this that...

1003
01:21:27,041 --> 01:21:29,583
- that we don't understand.
- Well, did you see it in my palm?

1004
01:21:30,375 --> 01:21:32,416
Did you dream it was meant to be?

1005
01:21:34,041 --> 01:21:37,125
He was the only person
who ever really saw who I was!

1006
01:21:37,208 --> 01:21:39,333
I'm sorry, Lucy. Okay?

1007
01:21:39,416 --> 01:21:42,125
I'm sorry! But can I please come in?

1008
01:21:44,166 --> 01:21:46,625
I feel like something really bad
is gonna happen.

1009
01:21:47,125 --> 01:21:48,125
It already has.

1010
01:21:59,291 --> 01:22:00,625
[pot whistling]

1011
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:45,916
[pot whistling]

01:23:26,541 --> 01:23:27,958
[door opening and closing]

1013
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:29,958
[guard] Louisa Fly.

1014
01:23:32,166 --> 01:23:33,541
[in Japanese] Come with me, please.

1015
01:23:47,541 --> 01:23:49,500
[Kameyama] <i>The DNA test came back.</i>

1016
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,083
<i>Looks like the girl in the bay</i>

1017
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:54,416
<i>was not your friend after all.</i>

1018
01:23:56,291 --> 01:23:57,541
Who was it?

1019
01:23:58,583 --> 01:23:59,833
[Kameyama] We don't know.

1020
01:24:00,416 --> 01:24:01,333
But...

1021
01:24:02,083 --> 01:24:04,500
we do know it wasn't Lily Bridges.

1022
01:24:05,125 --> 01:24:08,833
That puts your statement in serious doubt.

1023
01:24:11,333 --> 01:24:13,666
Did you murder Lily Bridges?

1024
01:24:21,250 --> 01:24:22,291
No.

1025
01:24:23,041 --> 01:24:24,916
Then why did you say you did?

1026
01:24:25,416 --> 01:24:27,250
Because I wanted to kill her.

1027
01:24:27,333 --> 01:24:29,916
[Oguchi]
You do realize the crime you confessed to

1028
01:24:30,375 --> 01:24:32,000
would be punishable by death?

1029
01:24:34,375 --> 01:24:39,375
We have been unable to locate Mr. Matsuda.

1030
01:24:41,166 --> 01:24:42,875
Do you know where he is?

1031
01:24:47,666 --> 01:24:52,083
Do you think there's a possibility
that Lily and Matsuda may have

1032
01:24:52,708 --> 01:24:54,250
run off somewhere together?

1033
01:24:55,083 --> 01:24:56,000
Yes.

1034
01:24:58,291 --> 01:24:59,541
I thought so.

1035
01:25:02,291 --> 01:25:06,500
At this point, we are reclassifying this
as a missing persons case.

1036
01:25:07,583 --> 01:25:10,041
I think I may have preferred it
when she was dead.

1037
01:25:13,666 --> 01:25:14,666
Well...

1038
01:25:17,375 --> 01:25:21,083
we all live in our own reality.

1039
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:26,875
Maybe, in some way,

1040
01:25:26,958 --> 01:25:29,625
you thought you did kill Lily Bridges.

1041
01:25:31,791 --> 01:25:35,583
But I never felt so.

1042
01:25:37,208 --> 01:25:41,250
You have guilt,
but it is from a deeper source.

1043
01:25:43,333 --> 01:25:44,666
Why did you come to Japan?

1044
01:25:45,166 --> 01:25:46,458
Why do you ask?

1045
01:25:47,125 --> 01:25:48,166
Tell me.

1046
01:25:53,666 --> 01:25:55,166
There was this tree.

1047
01:25:58,041 --> 01:25:59,833
I used to climb it.

1048
01:26:01,250 --> 01:26:02,750
All the way up.

1049
01:26:04,916 --> 01:26:05,958
Sometimes...

1050
01:26:06,833 --> 01:26:09,166
I would take a book and read.

1051
01:26:14,250 --> 01:26:15,250
One day...

1052
01:26:16,708 --> 01:26:22,041
my brothers showed up. They had been
on a fishing trip with the Boy Scouts.

1053
01:26:24,083 --> 01:26:25,583
I was eight.

1054
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:30,000
They surrounded the tree

1055
01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:34,375
and started throwing pine cones
and stones...

1056
01:26:36,583 --> 01:26:37,708
at me.

1057
01:26:41,291 --> 01:26:43,208
I told them to stop.

1058
01:26:47,416 --> 01:26:49,541
There was this sharp heavy stone
on the ground.

1059
01:26:51,458 --> 01:26:52,583
I saw my brother...

1060
01:26:53,958 --> 01:26:57,000
Marcus, he had his hands on it.

1061
01:26:58,708 --> 01:26:59,875
I met his eyes.

1062
01:27:00,958 --> 01:27:02,333
And his arm came up.

1063
01:27:04,583 --> 01:27:05,500
Then I just...

1064
01:27:08,583 --> 01:27:09,875
jumped...

1065
01:27:12,375 --> 01:27:13,916
right onto him.

1066
01:27:17,583 --> 01:27:19,333
Marcus fell back.

1067
01:27:21,291 --> 01:27:23,125
His head was pierced...

1068
01:27:24,083 --> 01:27:27,166
by a long rusty nail
sticking out from a plank of wood.

1069
01:27:28,291 --> 01:27:33,375
He tried to get up
with the plank still attached to him.

1070
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:36,458
And...

1071
01:27:38,291 --> 01:27:41,375
again, his eyes stared back at me.

1072
01:27:48,250 --> 01:27:50,208
He died in the hospital.

1073
01:27:53,583 --> 01:27:58,291
The nurse said to me,
"It's not your fault."

1074
01:28:00,791 --> 01:28:02,791
I didn't know what she meant.

1075
01:28:03,666 --> 01:28:04,916
So I just said...

1076
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:06,958
"Okay.

1077
01:28:08,166 --> 01:28:09,125
Yeah."

1078
01:28:12,333 --> 01:28:13,416
From that moment,

1079
01:28:15,416 --> 01:28:17,708
I didn't speak for three years.

1080
01:28:22,250 --> 01:28:25,166
It's easy to ignore people
when they are silent.

1081
01:28:28,166 --> 01:28:30,166
So that's what my family did.

1082
01:28:33,125 --> 01:28:34,541
My parents were heartbroken.

1083
01:28:36,208 --> 01:28:40,208
I knew what they were thinking about me.

1084
01:28:42,125 --> 01:28:43,208
So I...

1085
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:45,833
planned my escape.

1086

[Kameyama] How?

1087
01:28:47,583 --> 01:28:51,166
At the age of 11,
I started learning Japanese.

1088
01:28:56,750 --> 01:28:59,291
That's a very sad story.

1089
01:29:00,958 --> 01:29:01,833
Yes.

1090
01:29:07,375 --> 01:29:09,541
But it has nothing to do with this case.

1091
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,375
Can I go now?

1092
01:29:30,666 --> 01:29:32,166

Do you want to leave a message?

No.

1111
01:34:05,625 --> 01:34:06,875
It's okay.

1112
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:09,500

Hello, Lucy.

1116
01:35:15,375 --> 01:35:18,208
I've been waiting for you for two days.

1117
01:35:18,750 --> 01:35:22,166
I knew I had to come here,
that you would understand.

1118
01:35:24,250 --> 01:35:25,875
I was at the police station.

1119
01:35:26,875 --> 01:35:28,166
What did you tell them?

1120
01:35:29,541 --> 01:35:30,625
About you.

1121
01:35:35,875 --> 01:35:36,875
Nothing.

1122
01:35:38,625 --> 01:35:39,625
Then...

1123
01:35:40,166 --> 01:35:41,333
there's hope.

1124
01:35:42,041 --> 01:35:43,208
That's a funny word.

1126
01:35:48,791 --> 01:35:51,958
We can go away from here, to the north.

- I didn't let her.
- No.

1171

It wasn't your fault.

1172

It was.
