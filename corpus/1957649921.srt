What's this cop's name?

553
00:36:59,017 --> 00:37:00,352
Right here.

Yeah, listen.

This is Jim.

like that in a long time.

What's good for the goose
is good for the gander.

Yeah, so, Richie,
where's the money, huh?

I mean, look at you.

You're practically
Rudy's right hand man.

579
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,561
Remember how I always
used to say some day I'd

Yeah.

But you know,
sometimes you've got

it's time to move forward.

588

Hey, [inaudible],, now
who do you want to see?

602
00:39:39,611 --> 00:39:42,781
Looks pretty clear cut, a
couple of Japanese high rollers

603
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:44,315
took a wrong turn
and got rolled.

604
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:46,952
Right, Dagger?

Nothing.

607
00:39:50,088 --> 00:39:52,390
So far all we've come up
with is a bunch of dead ends.

608

What about the bullet
that killed my partner?

Anybody think about
checking for a match?

He's right, Frank.

622

Why don't you check
with ballistics

623

Don't worry about it.

last thing you're

you're still off this case.

mind right now, you know?

about this artist who
sold the same paintings

635

to several different buyers.

636

Sorry, I'm not with you.

637
00:40:49,848 --> 00:40:52,183
Well, he promised each
buyer the same painting

638
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,852
and collected up front money.

639
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,186
OK.

All right, suppose you
had this priceless object,

richest buyers in the world.

642
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:02,861
Why sell it just once?

643
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:04,630
Yeah, but the sword's
not like the painting.

It's already finished.

645
00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:07,799
The investor would simply
hand over the money

646
00:41:07,899 --> 00:41:09,167

supposed to be cold.

supposed to hurt.

My first husband was a cop.

Am I gonna get a hot
cup of coffee, or not?

and his boots so nice and
shiny, so tall and proud.

927

Hey, next time you take my
car, put some gas in it.

No problem.

Well, what are
you asking me for?

Richard Sireno?

941
01:05:32,629 --> 01:05:35,232
Yeah, I busted him a few years
back on some bullshit charge.

942

Did a little time and when
he got out, he left town.

Well, he's back.

944
01:05:39,069 --> 01:05:40,570
And he's a cop killer.

This is our case.

It's a long shot though.

956

Let me ask you something?

01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:39,563
Why am I doing this for Johnny?

958
01:06:39,663 --> 01:06:42,266
Because we're gonna nail
the guy who killed the chief.

959
