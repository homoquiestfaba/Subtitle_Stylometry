00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,600
(gun being loaded)

7
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,500

8
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:43,700

00:02:42,400 --> 00:03:09,700

29
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,700
THEY'RE GUESSING.

30
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,200
WITH KIDS, IT'S DIFFERENT.

31
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'LL BE FINE BY IT. HOW 'BOUT YOU?

32
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,500
UH-HUH.

33
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,100
SHE'S GONNA BE A MESS.

34
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,800
AH, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE SAW.

35
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,300
FUCK, ANDERSON! WE KNOW.

36
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,500
LISTEN...

37
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,300
THEY CALL 'EM WITNESSES
BECAUSE THEY'VE SEEN THINGS.

38
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:28,100
SO WE GO IN, FIND OUT.

39
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,400

40
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,900

BILLINGS...

44
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,500

DEGRASSO...OFFICER WRIGHT.

46
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,500

50
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:07,100
WE'RE PRETTY SURE WE KNOW

00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,700
AND THEY ALL ARRIVED
TOGETHER, LATE YESTERDAY?

52
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,200
YEAH, THAT'S THE WAY IT HAPPENED.

53
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,900
ONE OF OUR OFFICERS BROUGHT THEM
IN, UH HE'S IN THERE TOO, HE...

54
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,500
HE'S ALSO A WITNESS.

55
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,600
I UNDERSTAND ONE OF
YOUR OFFICERS WAS KILLED?

56
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,900
YEAH. JIM. JIM CONRAD.

57
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,600
NOW, UH THE YOUNG WOMAN...

58
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,300
SHE SEEMS TO BE INTOXICATED
OR IN SHOCK; THE CHILD...

59
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,900
THE 'YOUNG WOMAN' IS
HIGH AS A FUCKIN' KITE.

60
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,100
AS I WAS SAYING...

61
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,100
THE CHILD HASN'T SAID MUCH OF ANYTHING.

62
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,300
HOWEVER, SHE HAS BONDED
WITH THE YOUNG WOMAN...

63
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,800
BOBBI...BOBBI PRESCOTT.

64
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,300
AND IS THIS ALL SHE SAID?

65
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,100
UH, YEAH, ONLY WHAT WE TOOK NOTES ON.

66
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,300
THE...THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED
TO HER, YOU CAN'T BLAME HER.

67
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,400
AND YOU HAVE NO FEMALE
OFFICERS HERE, IS THAT RIGHT?

68
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,500
HAVE TWO OF YOU ALWAYS BEEN PRESENT?

69
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,800
WELL I WAS THERE... HI, I'M JANET.

NAME, HER NAME'S STEPHANIE...

72
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,100
'CAUSE OFFICER BENNETT TOLD ME
THAT HER NAME WAS STEPHANIE...

73
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,200
WE'LL NEED TO SEPARATE
THEM FOR THE INTERVIEWS.

74
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,700
THEY REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN
KEPT APART DURING THE NIGHT...

75
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,400
I TRUST MY OFFICER.

76
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,800
I NEVER SAID I DIDN'T...UH...

77
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,800
YOU KNOW...I'M SURE THAT
PROPER PROCEDURES WERE FOLLOWED,

78
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,700
AGENT HALLAWAY.

79
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,200
IT'S JUST...INTERESTING...THAT
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT BROUGHT UP

80
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,600

81
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,300

87
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,300
EVERYBODY WORK TOGETHER,
WE'RE GONNA GET GOING FASTER.

88
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,600

FOR NOW, NO.

98
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,400
THE ONLY ROLE YOUR NARCOTIC
USE PLAYS IS IN HOW IT MAY HAVE

99
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,400
AFFECTED YOUR PERCEPTION
OF THE EVENTS...

00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,600

101
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,900

00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,400
SO...

105
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,900

00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,200

113
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,100
C'MON NOW.

114
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,500
AGENT, CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

115
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,700

I LIKE TO SEPARATE 'EM, PUT 'EM ON TAPE.

117
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,300
I KNOW ONE OF YOUR OFFICERS IS IN THERE,

118
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:35,200
BUT...THERE'S ONLY ONE
WAY TO UNFOLD A NOTE,

119
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
SO TO SPEAK...WITHOUT TEARING THE PAPER.

120
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,200
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I FIGURED.

121
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,200
SO LET'S LOOK AND SEE WHAT WE'RE....

122
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,700

WE'RE GONNA TALK, RIGHT?

129
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,800
I WANT TO GO HOME.....

00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,800
I KNOW YOU DO, STEPHANIE...

00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,000
DO YOU HAVE SOME CRAYONS IN YOUR BAG?

141
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,800
THEY WERE IN THE CAR.

142
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,200
I HAVE SOME CRAYONS,
I THINK, IN THE OFFICE.

143
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,200

I THINK IT'S A SHAME MAKIN G
HER RE-LIVE ALL THOSE THINGS...

360
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,200
NO, I MEAN, I KNOW, OF COURS
E YOU'RE JUST DOING YOUR JOB,

361
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:18,600
I KNOW THAT...IT'S JUST...YOU
HAVE TO DO THIS, RIGHT?

362
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,200
I HAVE TO KNOW WHAT THEY'VE SEEN.

363
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,500
UH...

364
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,900

00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:26,100
OH YEAH...OH YEAH. EVERY DETAIL.

00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
OH GOD, I JUST...I JUST...OH.

367
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,600
YOU NEED THE INFORMATION
AND SPEAKING OF...

368
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,800
IT'S THE CORONER'S REPORT.

369
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,100
I'M 'FRIENDS' WITH THE CORONER.

370
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,700
YEAH.

371
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:49,000
WELL...THANK YOU.

372
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,600
YOU'RE WELCOME.

373
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,300
UM...NO LAB RESULTS?

374
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,800
NO, NO, HE'S RUSHING THOSE BUT
HE SAID IT'S JUST GOING TO TAKE

375
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,900
HIM A LONG TIME TO COLLECT IT ALL.

376
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:16,300
DID HE SAY WHAT HE'S COLLECTING?

377
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,700
I MEAN, DID HE MENTION...

378
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,500
BALLISTICS?

379
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,400
NO. BUT YOU KNOW HE IS
BIG ON HAIR AND FIBERS.

380
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,200
IT'S KIND OF HIS...SPECIALTY.

381
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,200
APPARENTLY THEY LEFT A LOT OF THAT.

382
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,600
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M WONDERING?

383
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,000
WHY WOULD THEY BE SO SLOPPY?

384
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:35,600
THEY'RE LIKELY TO IMPROVE.

385
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,100
OH. OF COURSE. YEAH.

386
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,400
UNLESS, MA'AM...

387
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:49,300
THEY JUST DON'T GIVE A SHIT.

388
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,900
OH MY GOD...

389
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,900
WHAT WE DO TO EACH OTHER, HUH?

390
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:56,100
MMH.

391
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,000
WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOIN' IN HERE?

392
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,200
THE UH, THE GIRL...BOBBI?

393
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,000
SHE HAD TO PISS.

394
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,600
AH.

395
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,300
WHY DON'T YOU GO AND MAKE
SURE SHE GETS BACK IN THE ROOM?

396
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,300
GO ON NOW...

397
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,100
OKAY!

398
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,700
AND WHY DON'T YOU GO KEEP AN EYE ON HIM.

399
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,100
ALRIGHT. THEN?

400
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:34,400
WE HAVE, UH, AREAS WE PATROL.

401
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,200
OOOOOH!

402
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,200
NICE SHOT!

403
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:45,800

404
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,500
ALRIGHT.

405
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,600
PICK YOUR FUCKIN' PERSONALITY.

406
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,300
I GET TO PICK?

407
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,700
I AM CLEARLY 'GOOD COP.'

408
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,400
MMM...THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

409
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,700
FRIEND TO THE PEOPLE!

410
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,700
'GOOD COP'!

411
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,400
WE PATROLLED THEM.

412
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,200
I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU

413
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,300
HELLO OFFICER, LOOKS
LIKE I HAD A TIRE BLOW...

414
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,600
THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE, HUH?

415
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,100
I GOT A SOLID SPARE, SO...

416
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,400
YEAH, WELL, I'M AFRAID I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO ASK YOU TO GET BACK

417
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,200
IN THE VEHICLE FOR THE MOMENT.

418
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,000
IS THERE A PROBLEM, OFFICER?

419
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:32,800
WELL, SIR...UH.

420
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
UH, KEITH.

421
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,400
OH. KEITH. OKAY. HI.

422
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,500
UM.. THERE'S NO PROBLEM WITH ME...

423
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,400
BUT YOU SEE MY PARTNER BACK THERE...?

424
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,800
YES SIR...HE LOOKS UPSET.

425
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,900
YEAH.

426
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,500
WELL...

427
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,800
WE GOT A COUPLE OF KILLERS
LOOSE...EVERYONE'S WOUND UP

428
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,500
PRETTY GOOD ABOUT IT BUT JACK THERE;

429
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,300
HE'S WOUND ESPECIALLY TIGHT.

430
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,600
UH, WE HEARD SOMETHING
ABOUT THAT ON THE RADIO...

431
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,000
OH NO NO, IT IS WORSE THAN
THEY'RE SAYING ON THE RADIO.

432
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,800
TRUST ME. AND JACK THERE
IS, WELL, LIKE I SAID,

433
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,700
PRETTY WOUND UP AND WE SAW
YOU GUYS COMING DOWN THE ROAD,

434
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,100
AND HE SWEARS THAT YOU WERE
PULLIN' TOO MUCH SPEED...

435
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,800
OH, JEEZ, I WASN'T
SPEEDING, OFFICER, I, I,

436
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,700
REALLY I WAS GOING...NOT
SPEEDING...SIR...

437
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,400
NO. NO. NO. RELAX,
KEITH. THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

438
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,600
YOU'RE 'PREACHING TO THE
CHOIR'. THAT'S WHAT I TOLD HIM.

439
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,100
IT WAS JUST A NORMAL SPEED, I
WAS GOING DOWN THE ROAD AND HAD

440
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,800
A TIRE BLOW OUT, I'M NOT...

441
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,300
YEAH, I KNOW. I TOLD HIM. AN
D HE DIDN'T LIKE IT WHEN I DID.

442
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:24,200
HERE HE COMES... ACT CASUAL.

443
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,700
GET DOWN ON THE FUCKING GROUND.

444
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,400
WHOA...UH...

445
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,900
GET DOWN ON THE FUCKING GROUND! NOW!

446
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,000
(Woman) GET DOWN, KEITH!

447
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,800
GO!

448
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,100
OH. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA... MA'AM!

449
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,900
PLEASE RETURN TO THE VEHICLE.

450
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,100
KEITH, HONEY...?

451
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,100
(Keith) PLEASE DON'T SHOOT ME!

452
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,000
I'LL BE IN THE CAR, HONEY....

453
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,600
PLEASE OFFICERS!

454
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,200
I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO GET YOUR WALLET

455
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,800
AND GIVE IT TO MY PARTNER.

456
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,000
KEITH, IT'S BEST TO DO WHAT HE SAYS,

457
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,200
BECAUSE WHEN HE GETS LIKE
THIS...IT'S JUST REALLY CRUCIAL

458
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,000
THAT HE FEELS LIKE YOU'RE LISTENING.

459
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,900
I'M LISTENING.... PLEASE
DON'T SHOOT ME, OFFICER!

460
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,300
WE LET HIM GO WITH A WARNING...

461
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:13,000
(Gunshots)

462
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,800
YOU KNOW HOW PEOPLE
GET OUT HERE, CAPTAIN...

463
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,800
YEAH.

464
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:24,600
THE WAY THEY START DRIVING
IN THE DESOLATE STRETCHES...

465
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:29,000
LIKE THE RACECAR DRIVERS
THEY ALWAYS WANTED TO BE.

466
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,600
SPEEDING IS THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE
OF TRAFFIC FATALITIES, YOU KNOW.

467
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,600
NOT THIS WEEK.

468
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:43,800
I'LL BE, UH, GETTIN' BACK TO IT NOW.

469
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:48,300
THAT'S AN EXCELLENT PLAN, WRIGHT.

470
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,200
YOU GETTIN' COFFEE?

471
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:54,300
LIGHT AND SWEET FOR ME, THERE, CHIEF.

472
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:38,900
SOMETHING I CAN DO FOR YOU, DEGRASSO?

473
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,900
JUST, UH, ENJOYING YOUR WORK.

474
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:47,800
HOW ABOUT YOU LET ME
ENJOY SOME OF YOURS?

475
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,600
GO ON...

476
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I THINK MAKING HIM ANGRY
IS A REALLY BAD IDEA.

477
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:59,900
OH, GEE MOM....TELL DAD
I'M REAL FUCKIN' SORRY.

478
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:03,700
HEY. AN ATTITUDE CHANGE, PLEASE?

479
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,900
IS THERE ANY MORE HOT CHOCOLATE?

480
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:12,500
UH, OF COURSE THERE
IS...CAN I KEEP THIS?

481
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,400
I DREW IT FOR YOU.

482
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,600
IT'S GREAT...

483
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,000
ALRIGHT, I'LL GO GET YOU
THA T HOT CHOCOLATE...

484
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,700
YOU'LL BE BE ALRIGHT, ON YOUR OWN?

485
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,800
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

486
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:59,900
¶¶

487
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,300

00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:09,800
THIS IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT.

491
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,000
BEAUTIFUL DAY.

492
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,800

00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,800

I'LL BE DAMNED....

496
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:45,200
YEAH, I THOUGHT IT WAS
PRETTY AMAZING MYSELF.

497
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,000
SHE HASN'T SAID MUCH.

498
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:52,300
WELL, I'M WORKING ON IT.

499
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,400
YOU'RE GOOD WITH HER.

500
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,200
YEAH.

501
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:05,800
WELL, I WAS ONCE A
SAD LITTLE GIRL MYSELF.

502
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,800
DON'T GO GETTING EMOTIONALLY INVOLVED...

503
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,800
THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS THIS
IS ABOUT AND YOU KNOW IT.

504
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,300
IT... IT'S BRINGING UP A LOT OF STUFF...

505
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,000
A LOT OF...

506
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:20,400
YOU CAN'T SAVE HER...

507
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,400
I KNOW.

508
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,100
HERE YOU GO...

509
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,800
THANK YOU.

510
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,900
WATCH...IT'S KIND OF HOT.

511
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:12,200

512
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,500
YOU LIKE BEING A FUCK-UP?

513
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,200
HEY, DEGRASSO...

00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:19,400
I DON'T LIKE THIS ...LADY.

515
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,500

516
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,600
MM-NN.

518
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,700

521
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,200
CHOP! CHOP!

SO, WE WERE JUST DRIVING ALONG...

523
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,400
ONE FOR YOU...

524
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,300
NO, I DON'T WANT ANOTHER ONE!

525
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,800
DO YOU WANT ME TO BE ABLE TO
DRIVE THE CAR OR DO YOU WANT ME

526
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,400
TO, LIKE, GO INTO CARDIAC ARREST?

00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:50,900
I'M NOT DOIN' IT.

00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,300
I'LL GRAB YOUR FUCKIN' TITS RIGHT NOW...

533
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,800
I SWEAR TO GOD I I WILL...

534
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,900
OH THEN I'M REALLY NOT

00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:24,500

YOU COULD HAVE REALLY GOTTEN
YOUR FATHER IN TROUBLE...

861
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,900

I'LL TAKE THAT.

1080
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:32,500
GREAT. I'D BETTER DEAL WITH THIS.

1081
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:41,000
MM-HMM LADIES AND GENTLEMEN...

1082
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:43,200
WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD AND
STRETCH YOUR LEGS AND WE'LL MEET

1083
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:45,300
IN THE CORRIDOR?

1084
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:47,700
THERE'S BEEN A DEVELOPMENT.

1085
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:50,900
AGENT ANDERSON, I'LL NEED TO
SPEAK TO YOU FOR A MOMENT BEFORE

1086
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:54,400
I UPDATE THE OTHERS.

1087
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:57,800
AH, THIS IS UNFORTUNATE.

1088
01:07:57,900 --> 01:08:01,600

AGENT HALLAWAY?

1093
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:17,900
UM, WELL, WE'VE WORKED
TOGETHER FOR A LONG TIME.

1094
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:20,200
THAT'S THE WAY MY MOM
LOOKED AT MY STEPFATHER,

1095
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:22,200
BEFORE THEY WERE MARRIED.

1096
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:24,000
THEY THOUGHT IT WAS A SECRET.

1097
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:27,600
BUT IT WASN'T. I KNEW.

1098
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,600
CAPTAIN?

1099
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:41,600

YOU GONNA TELL US WHAT'S HAPPENING?

1102
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:03,000
APPARENTLY A MAID HAS DISCOVERED
BODIES AT THE BLUE DOVE MOTEL.

1103
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:04,300
WHO'S GOIN'?

1104
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,500
UH, I'M GONNA TAKE WRIGHT AND DEGRASSO,

GET YOUR STUFF.

1107
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,000
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NOW?

1108
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:17,100
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GO SOMEPLACE, OKAY?

1109

1111
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:22,700
NO, WE'RE GONNA FINISH IT NOW,
I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU.

1112
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:26,500
JUST DO AS YOU'RE TOLD

1113
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:30,100

1114
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,800
C'MON LADIES, I HAVE SOME

1122
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,100

01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,200

01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:42,200

IT'S CRAZY BULLSHIT.

JUST THE WAY YOU LIKE IT.

1254
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:26,200
(Whispers) SHE'S WAY
TOO HOT TO BE F.B.I.

1255
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:28,700
HELLO...

I DIDN'T HEAR THAT.
WHAT WAS THAT YOU SAID?

1262
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:11,800
I SAID SHE WAS WAY TOO
FUCKABLE TO BE F.B.I.

1263
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:16,800
THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE...

1264
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:21,200
I SAID SHE SMELLED LIKE YOU.

1265
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:24,300
I LIKE THAT, AND I WANT YOU
TO TELL HER THAT WHEN SHE COMES

1266
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:26,000

1267
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,400
OKAY.

1268
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:28,900

1272
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:43,300
'CAUSE THIS WAS MY
FAVOURITE PART OF THE DAY.

1273
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:45,000
YOU AND YOUR BITCH

1274
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,000

1277
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:53,700

1278
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:55,100
IT'S FUN NOW.

1279
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,200
OKAY?

1280
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:58,200
'CAUSE FIRST OF ALL,
EVEN THOUGH, REGRETTABLY,

1281
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:02,200
THE CAPTAIN HERE IS UNABLE
TO HEAR YOUR ADMISSION,

1282
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:03,900
AND THAT WOULD'A BEEN PERFECT, BUT...

FUCK. YOU.

1287
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:13,000
NO.

1288
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:15,000
THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT ANSWER.

1289
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:28,600
BYE BABY...

1290
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:31,700

UGH! JACK!

1296
01:20:42,100 --> 01:20:44,200
HOSTAGE IS A SUSPECT!

1297
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:47,800
(Gunshots)

1298
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:55,100
I MAY HAVE ORCHESTRATED IT
BUT THEY WERE YOUR BULLETS.

1299
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:56,300
THIS IS KIND OF AMAZING.

1300
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,800
FUCK YOU, YOU FUCKING

1301
01:20:58,700 --> 01:21:01,200
HEY, NO, SHE'S IMPRESSED!

01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:04,400
THE LITTLE GIRL WAS IMPRESSED, TOO.

1303
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:05,600

1304
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:06,800

1308
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,200
(Gunshot)

1309
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:26,300
IT'S HARD TO IMPRESS CHILDRE
N WITH THAT SHIT THEY GET ALL

1310
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:28,100
SLOBBERY AND UNCONTROLLED AND EVERYTHING

1311
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:31,500

01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:47,400

01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:55,700
AND REMEMBER, I WAS THERE.

1318
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:57,900

1328
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:59,300
