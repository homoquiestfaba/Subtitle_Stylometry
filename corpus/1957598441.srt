Hi, will you go out with me? Thank you.

183
00:13:12,506 --> 00:13:14,942
[Scotty humming]

184
00:13:16,743 --> 00:13:19,314
Mac is right, man. Mac is right.

185
00:13:21,749 --> 00:13:22,817
She’s out of my league.

186
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:34,030
Who is that guy? What has that guy got that I don’t got? Huh?

187
00:13:35,433 --> 00:13:40,204
Now all I need is a job and money,

188
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,643
and muscles, and a house.

189
00:13:47,012 --> 00:13:48,114
[exhales]

190
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,719
You’re the man. What do you think I need?

191
00:14:02,464 --> 00:14:03,698
Okay.

192
00:14:12,376 --> 00:14:15,812
The only thing you really need is a good blanket.

193
00:14:17,415 --> 00:14:19,317
All I need is a good blanket.

194
00:14:21,185 --> 00:14:22,453
That’s all I need.

195
00:14:24,356 --> 00:14:26,992
Bye. All I need is a good blanket.

196
00:14:30,397 --> 00:14:34,167
I wish, I really wish...

197
00:14:34,234 --> 00:14:40,141
What I really wish is that I had a warm bed,

198
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:43,211
and a couple of babes.

199
00:14:45,514 --> 00:14:46,882
Excuse me.

200
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:09,809
Does anyone know what time it is?

201
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:11,511
Let me check.

202
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,483
[moans]

203
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:18,953
It’s only 8:30.

204
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:23,191
Oh, goody, we can sleep a couple more hours.

205
00:15:28,263 --> 00:15:30,500
[screaming]

206
00:15:34,671 --> 00:15:36,173
[panting]

207
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:40,211
What’s going on here?

208
00:15:40,277 --> 00:15:41,746
I don’t know.

209
00:15:41,813 --> 00:15:43,248
I thought you said we could sleep in a couple more hours.

210
00:15:43,315 --> 00:15:45,217
[siren wailing]

211
00:15:53,527 --> 00:15:55,195
-Got to get out of here. -What?

212
00:16:18,456 --> 00:16:19,957
[bells chiming]

213
00:16:21,526 --> 00:16:23,395
[mystic] I’ll be right with you.

214
00:16:33,506 --> 00:16:34,574
Wow.

215
00:16:43,351 --> 00:16:44,386
A little.

216
00:16:46,521 --> 00:16:49,358
Do you think that genies are real?

217
00:16:50,693 --> 00:16:53,263
I think that if a person believes

218
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:57,234
in the power of the genie, then that power will be real.

219
00:16:58,135 --> 00:17:00,672
Okay, what about magic lamps,

220
00:17:00,738 --> 00:17:02,640
and three wishes, and all that stuff?

221
00:17:05,277 --> 00:17:06,645
Depends on the genie.

222
00:17:06,712 --> 00:17:08,280
[laughing wickedly]

223
00:17:10,482 --> 00:17:12,285
But, it’s possible?

224
00:17:12,352 --> 00:17:15,355
Young man, anything is possible.

225
00:17:17,325 --> 00:17:18,359
Okay.

226
00:17:55,168 --> 00:17:56,136
What was I thinking?

227
00:17:56,203 --> 00:17:57,638
I have no idea.

228
00:17:57,704 --> 00:17:59,440
Genies don’t know how to read thoughts.

229
00:17:59,507 --> 00:18:00,642
Who are you?

230
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:03,745
I’m your genie and you are my master.

231
00:18:03,811 --> 00:18:05,781
Your wish is my command.

232
00:18:05,848 --> 00:18:07,483
Did the person from the Mystic shop

233
00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:08,684
send you in here to hassle me?

234
00:18:08,751 --> 00:18:12,289
No, you summoned me here when you rubbed my lamp.

235
00:18:14,224 --> 00:18:15,725
You know, you could get arrested for being in here.

236
00:18:18,095 --> 00:18:20,331
Doesn’t anyone on Earth believe in trust?

237
00:18:20,398 --> 00:18:21,232
[scoffs]

238
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,002
Look, if you don’t believe me,

239
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:26,438
then why don’t you make another wish?

240
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:32,679
Okay, um...

241
00:18:36,784 --> 00:18:37,751
You did that?

242
00:18:37,818 --> 00:18:39,286
As you wish, Master.

243
00:18:40,087 --> 00:18:41,690
You really are a genie.

244
00:18:41,756 --> 00:18:42,991
As real as they come.

245
00:18:43,058 --> 00:18:47,396
And...and...and you can grant me any wish I want?

246
00:18:47,463 --> 00:18:48,597
Well, almost anything.

247
00:18:48,664 --> 00:18:50,599
There are some rules we need to go over.

248
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:53,170
Okay, my favorite hat.

249
00:18:53,236 --> 00:18:55,505
Wow! Wow.

250
00:18:57,441 --> 00:18:59,544
Cute little genie bottle, let’s go!

251
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,846
Look at the lovely shells.

252
00:19:01,913 --> 00:19:04,248
So I’m the only one that can see or, hear you?

253
00:19:04,315 --> 00:19:05,417
That is right, Master.

254
00:19:05,484 --> 00:19:06,752
Wow! Okay, all right.

255
00:19:06,819 --> 00:19:09,655
My name is Scotty McKay. You, you can call me Scotty.

256
00:19:09,722 --> 00:19:11,491
I can only address you as Master.

257
00:19:11,558 --> 00:19:12,859
All right, well, what should I call you?

258
00:19:12,926 --> 00:19:14,160
You can call me Jeanie.

259
00:19:14,227 --> 00:19:17,531
Jeanie, Jeanie, okay. Of course, I knew that.

260
00:19:17,598 --> 00:19:21,635
All right, this is the beach, and you’re invisible. Neat-o!

261
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:24,172
Here, have a nice cool Coke.

262
00:19:24,239 --> 00:19:26,541
Wash that good old-fashioned hot dog down.

263
00:19:26,608 --> 00:19:27,576
Matter of fact, that looks pretty good.

264
00:19:27,642 --> 00:19:28,877
I’m gonna have one myself, see.

265
00:19:28,944 --> 00:19:31,514
I don’t sell products I don’t endorse.

266
00:19:31,581 --> 00:19:33,149
You know that’s just not American.

267
00:19:35,252 --> 00:19:37,154
So, Master, tell me about yourself.

268
00:19:39,256 --> 00:19:41,192
Well, I used to have this girlfriend,

269
00:19:41,259 --> 00:19:43,228
but, she wasn’t what I was looking for.

270
00:19:43,828 --> 00:19:45,096
What are you looking for?

271
00:19:49,235 --> 00:19:50,403
That.

272
00:19:53,907 --> 00:19:55,675
Who is that?

273
00:19:55,742 --> 00:19:57,210
That’s the girl of my dreams.

274
00:19:59,547 --> 00:20:00,648
Dana, hi.

275
00:20:01,949 --> 00:20:04,352
Hi.

276
00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:05,421
Nice suit.

277
00:20:06,355 --> 00:20:08,257
Oh! Skippy, right?

278
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,426
[man] Dana.

279
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:12,061
Hi!

280
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:15,532
Obviously mistaking me for a jar of peanut butter.

281
00:20:15,598 --> 00:20:17,735
She must have been a lot friendlier in your dreams.

282
00:20:17,802 --> 00:20:19,470
She’s just what I’m looking for.

283
00:20:20,805 --> 00:20:22,006
Wait a minute. Okay.

284
00:20:22,072 --> 00:20:25,410
I wish that Dana were madly in love with me,

285
00:20:25,477 --> 00:20:27,546
and I wish for it to happen right now.

286
00:20:27,612 --> 00:20:30,216
No, no, no, no! Master, wait!

287
00:20:30,283 --> 00:20:31,684
Oh, yeah.

288
00:20:32,185 --> 00:20:33,619
Oh, yeah.

289
00:20:36,523 --> 00:20:38,492
Oh, yeah.

290
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,894
So, what do you say we go back to your place

291
00:20:40,961 --> 00:20:43,898
and you can tell me how you really feel about me?

292
00:20:43,965 --> 00:20:45,867
What are you talking about?

293
00:20:46,668 --> 00:20:48,671
I’m talking about love.

294
00:20:48,737 --> 00:20:50,639
I’m talking about you and me together and forever.

295
00:20:50,706 --> 00:20:51,974
I’m talking about maybe children.

296
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:57,280
I’m talking about you pouring water on my head.

297
00:20:57,347 --> 00:20:58,615
[all laughing]

298
00:21:00,651 --> 00:21:02,620
Can you believe this guy? Hah!

299
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:05,591
[all laughing]

300
00:21:05,657 --> 00:21:07,526
-Now get out of here, Skippy. -Scotty.

301
00:21:07,593 --> 00:21:08,560
-Like today. -Okay.

302
00:21:08,627 --> 00:21:10,829
Hey! Off the court, dude!

303
00:21:10,896 --> 00:21:12,565
Master, I was trying to tell you,

304
00:21:12,632 --> 00:21:14,300
I couldn’t grant that wish.

305
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,602
Why?

306
00:21:15,668 --> 00:21:16,937
We’re in the middle of a game, butt-head.

307
00:21:17,004 --> 00:21:19,406
Genies can’t control matters of the heart.

308
00:21:19,473 --> 00:21:21,442
Well, what can you do about it?

309
00:21:21,509 --> 00:21:23,278
Well, I can kick your little ass, that’s what.

310
00:21:23,345 --> 00:21:24,312
What?

311
00:21:24,379 --> 00:21:25,914
Master, I can do anything you want,

312
00:21:25,981 --> 00:21:29,018
but, don’t ask me to make someone fall in love with you.

313
00:21:29,085 --> 00:21:30,520
All right, that’s it. I warned you.

314
00:21:30,586 --> 00:21:33,990
I wish I was the best volleyball player in the world.

315
00:21:34,056 --> 00:21:36,727
I’m sure you do. Now, off.

316
00:21:36,793 --> 00:21:38,395
A hundred buck says I can kick your little butt

317
00:21:38,462 --> 00:21:39,630
in a game of two-on-two.

318
00:21:40,965 --> 00:21:43,268
Right. You and who else?

319
00:21:43,334 --> 00:21:44,469
I don’t care, you pick him.

320
00:21:44,969 --> 00:21:45,937
Okay.

321
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:51,911
Okay, you and the guy eating the hot dog over there.

322
00:21:56,449 --> 00:21:57,951
Okay, you’re on.

323
00:21:58,018 --> 00:21:59,253
All right, fine, smart ass, you’re on.

324
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,923
Okay, dumb butt you’re on. Let’s go.

325
00:22:01,989 --> 00:22:03,791
["Up/Down/In/Out " playing]

326
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:22,713
Come on.

327
00:22:46,608 --> 00:22:47,943
Come on, man!

328
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:50,646
[man] Don’t give up, man.

329
00:23:00,591 --> 00:23:01,626
Let’s go.

330
00:23:14,674 --> 00:23:16,809
It was your ball, man. Your ball.

331
00:23:16,877 --> 00:23:18,412
Come on. Get the ball.

332
00:23:29,225 --> 00:23:30,726
Damn it.

333
00:23:45,943 --> 00:23:47,046
[grunts]

334
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:23,788
-Excuse me, Deborah. -It’s Dana.

335
00:24:24,355 --> 00:24:25,957
Oh, right, sorry.

336
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:44,445
[breathing heavily]

337
00:25:02,733 --> 00:25:04,435
[crowd cheering]

338
00:25:16,984 --> 00:25:18,552
[Scotty] You can keep the hundred bucks.

339
00:25:23,158 --> 00:25:26,127
Adrian! Adrian!

340
00:25:26,728 --> 00:25:27,929
[man] All right.

341
00:25:31,734 --> 00:25:33,602
She was definitely looking at me. Did you see that?

342
00:25:33,669 --> 00:25:34,703
I noticed.

343
00:25:34,771 --> 00:25:35,939
And what about the "Deborah" line?

344
00:25:36,006 --> 00:25:37,274
Pretty smooth, huh?

345
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,608
Extremely smooth.

346
00:25:38,675 --> 00:25:39,910
I got to tell the guys.

347
00:25:40,177 --> 00:25:41,746
Wait!

348
00:25:41,813 --> 00:25:43,314
Your friends actually live here?

349
00:25:43,381 --> 00:25:46,250
Are you kidding? They can barely afford to rent the garage.

350
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,800
Dudes, our problems are solved.

351
00:25:59,867 --> 00:26:01,068
The answer to all of your prayers

352
00:26:01,135 --> 00:26:02,703
is standing right here next to me.

353
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:06,274
Soup, Lars, I’d like you to meet Jeanie, my personal genie.

354
00:26:06,341 --> 00:26:07,876
She’ll give us whatever we want.

355
00:26:09,177 --> 00:26:11,113
I... I don’t see anybody.

356
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,281
That’s because I’m the only one...

357
00:26:12,348 --> 00:26:14,617
Wait a minute! Wait. Just wait... Okay.

358
00:26:14,684 --> 00:26:18,055
Jeanie, I wish that Soup and Lars could see you too.

359
00:26:22,192 --> 00:26:24,963
Excellent! Bitching pink babe!

360
00:26:26,231 --> 00:26:28,666
Can we share her?

361
00:26:28,734 --> 00:26:32,838
Jeanie, we need a big place. Like uh, like uh... Lars!

362
00:26:32,905 --> 00:26:35,208
Like remember the beach club that we got kicked out of?

363
00:26:35,275 --> 00:26:36,710
The one that burnt down. That one.

364
00:26:36,776 --> 00:26:38,211
Scotty, that wasn’t my fault.

365
00:26:38,278 --> 00:26:40,146
Dude, I’m aware of that. Something...

366
00:26:53,763 --> 00:26:59,703
What! Oh, man!

Oh, there’s the bar!

371
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,248
Would you look at this!

372
00:27:12,251 --> 00:27:14,654
[Soup] Oh, man! Jeanie! Scotty!

373
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,755
Look at this!

374
00:27:25,233 --> 00:27:26,634
[Scotty] Unbelievable!

375
00:27:28,737 --> 00:27:30,272

-I recognize this... -Yo. Yo! Yo!

380
00:27:41,085 --> 00:27:42,954
-[Scotty] Where’s Soup’s room? -Follow the woman in pink!

381
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,755

[Lars] Jeanie!

384
00:28:08,283 --> 00:28:09,884
Stop the music!

385
00:28:09,951 --> 00:28:13,255
I’m gonna need a killer stereo

386
00:28:13,322 --> 00:28:16,058
that only plays tunes by The Afterbirth.

387
00:28:17,127 --> 00:28:18,795
Wait, wait...

388
00:28:18,862 --> 00:28:20,630
Dude, wait, what am I thinking?

389
00:28:20,697 --> 00:28:25,703
Why don’t I just have Afterbirth playing live in my room all the time?

391

Afterbirth! Kings of rock!

392
00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:48,530
Oh, Lars. Would you mind if we had a couple of drinks?

393
00:28:48,597 --> 00:28:51,400
Dude, anything you want, man, anything.

394
00:28:51,466 --> 00:28:53,036
[band member] All right.

395
00:28:53,102 --> 00:28:55,405
So, Master, what would you like?

396
00:28:55,471 --> 00:28:58,074
I don’t know. It’s got to be something that will impress Dana.

397
00:28:58,141 --> 00:29:00,911
Something subtle, yet effective.

398
00:29:08,153 --> 00:29:09,320
[Jeanie] So, what do you think?

399
00:29:09,387 --> 00:29:10,455
[Scotty whistles]

400
00:29:10,522 --> 00:29:13,192
Well, this is subtle, yet effective.

401
00:29:14,393 --> 00:29:15,461
Do you think Dana will like it?

402
00:29:15,528 --> 00:29:16,997
-I’m sure... -Oh, Jeanie, baby.

403
00:29:17,064 --> 00:29:18,498
Listen, listen, listen. I was just sitting on my throne,

404
00:29:18,565 --> 00:29:24,305
thinking about some of the things I’d like to have.

405
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,742
to the happiest place on Earth.

406

Jeanie!

412
00:29:42,093 --> 00:29:44,228
What’s the matter, Master? The tiki bar not big enough?

413
00:29:44,295 --> 00:29:46,798
I need $10,000 cash.

414
00:29:47,966 --> 00:29:49,167
Of course, Master.

415
00:29:51,937 --> 00:29:53,072
Wow.

416
00:29:54,006 --> 00:29:55,508
Master, you know, I really must warn you

417
00:29:55,575 --> 00:29:57,009
about taking advantage of money.

418
00:29:57,076 --> 00:29:58,010
-It’s a very powerful... -Come on, man, it’s your idea.

419
00:29:58,077 --> 00:29:59,446
-Dangerous thing. -You ask her.

Yeah, enough to fill up a swimming pool.

422
00:30:08,523 --> 00:30:11,227
Howdy. Remember me? Last night?

423
00:30:11,293 --> 00:30:12,394
You gave me the blanket.

424
00:30:13,262 --> 00:30:15,197
Yeah. So what?

425
00:30:15,264 --> 00:30:19,136
So I’ve run into a little luck and I want you to have this.

426
00:30:19,202 --> 00:30:24,509
You can buy as many blankets as you want.

427
00:30:25,977 --> 00:30:26,944
You don’t understand.

428
00:30:27,011 --> 00:30:28,514
You can have whatever you want.

429
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,549
A house, a car, anything.

430
00:30:31,383 --> 00:30:32,918
You don’t understand.

Well, what do you want?

432
00:30:38,391 --> 00:30:39,926
I want to work!

433
00:30:45,332 --> 00:30:47,969
Okay, okay. What if I offered you a job?

434
00:30:50,372 --> 00:30:52,374
Substantial salary for an honest day’s work.

435
00:30:55,211 --> 00:30:56,879
-Yeah? -Yeah.

436
00:30:58,214 --> 00:30:59,383
What kind of job?

437
00:31:00,551 --> 00:31:02,619
Okay, now, this may be a little weird.

438
00:31:02,686 --> 00:31:03,820
Don’t freak out, but...

439
00:31:03,887 --> 00:31:06,157
I’d like to introduce you to Jeanie.

Jeanie here, she’ll just zap it up for you.

444

for what’s coming to me, thank you.

446

00:31:22,309 --> 00:31:24,579
Now that we’re no longer living like roaches,

448
00:31:24,645 --> 00:31:26,948
and we’re definitely living large!

Yo, who’s that?

452
00:31:34,256 --> 00:31:36,559
Oh, guys, guys, this is Gus.

453
00:31:36,626 --> 00:31:40,196
And if you need anything, Gus here, he’s your man.

454
00:31:40,263 --> 00:31:42,199
Jeanie, would you show Gus to his room?

455
00:31:44,034 --> 00:31:45,169
Thank you.

456
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,508
My man stinks!

457
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,545
Yeah, I wish that guy had a shower, dude.

458
00:31:52,612 --> 00:31:54,714
Listen, guys, if this party is gonna happen,

459
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:57,216
we’re gonna have to get on the phone and call some women.

460
00:31:59,219 --> 00:32:00,654
I don’t know about you guys,

461
00:32:00,721 --> 00:32:02,656
but, I’m sick of the girls we’ve been chilling with.

462
00:32:02,723 --> 00:32:04,291
We need something new.

463
00:32:04,358 --> 00:32:05,627
Something different.

464
00:32:05,693 --> 00:32:07,228
Something like that.

Uh, that’s it.

Everything’s perfect.

491

It’s a wonderful thing, what you’re doing with Gus.

Yes, Gus just went to pick her up.

No.

502
00:33:59,292 --> 00:34:02,662
In fact, the gathering is commencing as we speak.

00:36:37,843 --> 00:36:40,347
A, eh, B, eh.

543
00:36:43,584 --> 00:36:46,421
Jeanie, this is great. Thanks for taking care of me.

544
00:36:46,487 --> 00:36:47,355
I really appreciate it.

545
00:36:47,855 --> 00:36:49,324
It’s my job.

546
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:52,328
Anyway, it’s easy when someone has such a romantic dream.

547
00:36:52,394 --> 00:36:55,731
You mean, you don’t enjoy granting those wishes for Soup and Lars?

548
00:36:55,798 --> 00:36:57,800
I didn’t say that.

549
00:36:58,902 --> 00:37:01,004
You really are an angel, you know that?

550
00:37:01,705 --> 00:37:03,807
No, I’m not, I’m a genie.

551
00:37:10,014 --> 00:37:13,118
[Lars] Anyway, I told Gorbachecks on the phone,

552
00:37:13,185 --> 00:37:16,856
"Dude, I can’t support any political sanctions

553
00:37:16,923 --> 00:37:21,394
against the country of Bulgearea."

554
00:37:21,461 --> 00:37:22,563
[laughs]

555
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,898
-Bulljarea? -Bulgaria.

556
00:37:24,965 --> 00:37:27,401
Oh, I knew that.

557
00:37:41,652 --> 00:37:45,022
Oh, my goodness! I can’t believe he’s here!

558
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:46,691
Who’s here?

559
00:37:46,758 --> 00:37:47,659
The point is, if you’re gonna work that hard on a tan,

560
00:37:47,725 --> 00:37:48,426
let me look at your shoulder.

561
00:37:48,493 --> 00:37:50,728
[Dana] Donald Burbank.

562
00:37:50,795 --> 00:37:55,801
The movie producer.

563
00:37:56,335 --> 00:37:57,870
Are you serious?

564
00:37:57,936 --> 00:37:59,372
Sure, we grew up together.

565
00:37:59,773 --> 00:38:00,840
Really?

566
00:38:00,907 --> 00:38:02,342
Yeah. Come on.

567
00:38:13,755 --> 00:38:17,694
Scotty! Well, son of a gun.

568
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,895
How are you?

569
00:38:18,961 --> 00:38:20,596
Good. Very good.

570
00:38:20,663 --> 00:38:22,700
Boy, it seems like only yesterday

571
00:38:22,766 --> 00:38:25,969
that we were stealing the hubcaps off

572
00:38:26,036 --> 00:38:28,573
of old man Goddy’s Cadillac?

573
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,643
Those were the days, weren’t they?

574
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,978
Donald, this is my good friend, Dana Stanford.

575
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:35,448
This is Donald Burbank.

576
00:38:37,116 --> 00:38:39,752
Scott, people are trying to set Lars on fire.

577
00:38:41,521 --> 00:38:42,556
I know you.

578
00:38:44,891 --> 00:38:46,160
You’re the cooler girl.

579
00:38:46,894 --> 00:38:48,963
That is great stuff.

580
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,531
Thank you.

581
00:38:50,598 --> 00:38:53,902
Just great stuff.

582
00:38:56,672 --> 00:38:59,476
So, call my office next week, please.

583
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:01,745
Okay?

584
00:39:14,326 --> 00:39:16,896
Lars! This is a party like you read about.

585
00:39:16,963 --> 00:39:19,799
Dude, you cannot have a bad time at this party.

586
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:22,169
Whoa. Wait a minute.

587
00:39:22,236 --> 00:39:25,172
Miss Japan, you must be at the wrong party.

588
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:27,941
See, there’s nothing but, fun allowed here.

589
00:39:28,008 --> 00:39:29,844
I’m sorry. I’m just very nervous

590
00:39:29,911 --> 00:39:32,080
about the singing competition next week.

591
00:39:32,147 --> 00:39:34,850
I’ve taken lessons since I was a little girl,

592
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:38,621
and I’m terrible. I can’t let my family down.

593
00:39:38,687 --> 00:39:39,688
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

594
00:39:39,755 --> 00:39:41,158
You’re underestimating yourself.

595
00:39:41,224 --> 00:39:43,894
See, the air here in the States

596
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:47,932
lends itself perfectly to bad Japanese singing, right, Lars?

597
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,668
-Yeah! -Really?

598
00:39:50,735 --> 00:39:52,704
Go out there and knock them dead!

599
00:39:52,771 --> 00:39:56,074
Yeah, yeah, yeah, just get up there and just blow them away!

600
00:39:58,711 --> 00:40:00,113
[both] Jeanie!

601
00:40:01,181 --> 00:40:03,016
[soothing music]

602
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:13,795
Scotty, what exactly is it that you do?

603
00:40:13,862 --> 00:40:16,065
Well, I could tell you, but, I’d have to kill you.

604
00:40:16,399 --> 00:40:18,134
[laughs]

605
00:40:18,201 --> 00:40:22,606
Well, actually, I have a billion dollar company,

606
00:40:22,673 --> 00:40:25,209
and a Ferrari, and a house in the hills.

607
00:40:25,275 --> 00:40:26,810
Very funny.

608
00:40:26,877 --> 00:40:28,346
I’d like to propose a toast.

609
00:40:28,413 --> 00:40:29,914
To what?

610
00:40:33,051 --> 00:40:34,220
To...

611
00:40:36,021 --> 00:40:37,756
All of our wishes coming true.

612
00:40:41,895 --> 00:40:46,000
[announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Miss Japan.

613
00:40:47,835 --> 00:40:50,638

[knock on the door]

621
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,847
I’m just gonna get that.

622
00:41:59,752 --> 00:42:01,521
Hey, Scott-O. This is Heidi.

623
00:42:01,588 --> 00:42:04,925
She’s gonna bum out big time if you can’t teach the Afterbirth

00:42:04,992 --> 00:42:06,694
some righteous yodeling tunes.

625
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:10,131
Yo! And this is Miss Bermuda Triangle.

626
00:42:10,198 --> 00:42:11,933
Just give them whatever they want.

627
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,337
Master, you’re not planning on sleeping with her tonight, are you?

628
00:42:15,403 --> 00:42:18,407
Jeanie, my wish of wishes is about to come true.

629
00:42:18,474 --> 00:42:22,012
But, you told me you didn’t want this thing to be a one night stand.

630
00:42:25,816 --> 00:42:27,617
I lied.

631
00:42:27,684 --> 00:42:30,254
But, don’t you see? If you move too fast, she won’t respect you.

632
00:42:50,244 --> 00:42:53,915
So, how is it going?

633
00:42:53,982 --> 00:42:56,084
Great! Master’s getting his wish.

634
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,154
I was talking about you.

635
00:42:59,956 --> 00:43:01,924
My only concern is for my master.

636
00:43:04,194 --> 00:43:05,162
I see.

637
00:43:07,031 --> 00:43:09,433
Well, you need anything, you let me know, all right?

638
00:43:10,235 --> 00:43:11,302
Okay.

639
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:20,146
[sighs]

640
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:31,959
I saw Dana leave this morning.

641
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:36,165
Yeah, we had a great time. She was particularly fond of the hot wax,

642
00:43:36,231 --> 00:43:39,501
while I was rather partial to the pasta noodle bondage games.

643
00:43:39,568 --> 00:43:42,272
Relax, nothing happened.

644
00:43:42,338 --> 00:43:44,240
But, I thought she was in your room all night.

645
00:43:44,307 --> 00:43:45,843
Yeah, but, I was sleeping on the floor

646
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:48,045
with the Manchester Jazz Quartet.

647
00:43:48,112 --> 00:43:49,780
Nothing happened with them, either.

648
00:43:50,915 --> 00:43:53,885
Anyway, I was thinking about this all night,

649
00:43:53,952 --> 00:43:55,954
and if Dana is gonna fall in love with me,

650
00:43:56,021 --> 00:43:57,990
I’m gonna need a whole new image.

651
00:43:58,057 --> 00:44:00,193
Master, I don’t think you need a new image.

652
00:44:00,259 --> 00:44:03,396
I mean, if she really cares about you.

653
00:44:03,463 --> 00:44:06,100
I mean, don’t you think she’d see that?

654
00:44:06,166 --> 00:44:08,936
I think you should just be yourself and see what happens.

655
00:44:09,002 --> 00:44:11,840
I tried that. Remember Skippy?

656
00:44:11,906 --> 00:44:14,509
Jeanie, I want Dana to feel like she’s in a whirlwind

657
00:44:14,576 --> 00:44:16,345
every moment she’s with me.

658
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:18,747
Well, we can do that,

659
00:44:18,814 --> 00:44:20,316
but, I just think you should hold off on the moves

660
00:44:20,382 --> 00:44:24,221
until she knows that, you know, she really cares about you.

661
00:44:26,223 --> 00:44:28,292
Okay, but, can we still do the whirlwind part?

662
00:44:28,359 --> 00:44:29,627
[chuckles]

663
00:44:29,694 --> 00:44:30,995
Of course, Master.

664
00:44:31,062 --> 00:44:32,296
Yes! Thank you.

665
00:44:33,664 --> 00:44:37,169
And, so now that you’re an expert on the classics,

666
00:44:37,236 --> 00:44:39,104
let me show you something more contemporary.

667
00:44:39,906 --> 00:44:43,476
Jeanie, this art, it speaks to me.

668
00:44:43,543 --> 00:44:48,582
It’s black and white, it’s racial without being racist.

669
00:44:48,649 --> 00:44:50,151
It...

670
00:44:54,055 --> 00:44:55,457
Why is it ripped in the middle?

671
00:45:00,463 --> 00:45:07,938
Okay. Chicken Cortez

672
00:45:09,106 --> 00:45:10,942
Napkin.

673
00:45:11,009 --> 00:45:13,978
All right. That’s poultry and pasta.

674
00:45:16,649 --> 00:45:18,217
Le Chateau Sauvignon.

675
00:45:18,784 --> 00:45:21,086
Wrong. Try again.

676
00:45:21,153 --> 00:45:22,989
No, I’m sure of it, le Chateau Sauvignon.

677
00:45:23,723 --> 00:45:25,358
Who is the expert here?

678
00:45:25,425 --> 00:45:27,127
[Scotty] You are. Okay.

679
00:45:28,696 --> 00:45:31,098
Oh, I know. Mont Blanc Chablis.

680
00:45:32,266 --> 00:45:34,303
Yes! See, you’re getting it.

681
00:45:34,369 --> 00:45:36,004
Thank you. Give me another one.

682
00:45:38,073 --> 00:45:39,107
Come on.

683
00:45:39,174 --> 00:45:40,043
Um...

684
00:45:41,344 --> 00:45:47,084
Meat! Talk to me about meat. Meat! Red, juicy meat.

685
00:45:47,151 --> 00:45:51,255
The meat of love. Meats and reds. That’s what you need...

686
00:45:54,059 --> 00:45:56,061
Hi.

687
00:45:56,127 --> 00:46:02,902
[stuttering] I’m rehearsing for a mayonnaise commercial.

688
00:46:07,407 --> 00:46:08,508
[laughs]

689
00:46:13,748 --> 00:46:16,318
Sorry. I’m not very good at this.

690
00:46:26,663 --> 00:46:31,335
Okay, okay, okay. Just don’t think about it.

691
00:46:31,402 --> 00:46:34,406
Just let it happen, okay? Okay?

692
00:46:34,473 --> 00:46:38,143
Now, now, close your eyes, let’s try it again.

693
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:57,432
You know, the song isn’t over.

694
00:47:00,102 --> 00:47:02,104
You know what, you got it.

695
00:47:03,472 --> 00:47:05,042
-Okay. -Let’s go.

696
00:47:05,108 --> 00:47:06,209
All right.

697
00:47:09,681 --> 00:47:11,783
Well, that’s very nice,

698
00:47:11,849 --> 00:47:15,053
but, I think that the Paristrous Cabernet 1968

699
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:17,823
chilled to just three degrees below room temperature

700
00:47:17,890 --> 00:47:20,626
should complement the flavor a little bit nicer, thank you.

701
00:47:20,693 --> 00:47:23,997
Very good. Actually quite an excellent choice.

702
00:47:25,832 --> 00:47:27,334
You’re incredible, Scotty.

703
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:28,803
Oh, come on.

704
00:47:28,869 --> 00:47:31,772
No, I’m serious. You critiqued every piece of art

705
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,441
in the museum this afternoon.

706
00:47:33,507 --> 00:47:37,512
And now we’re dining at the smartest restaurant in town.

707
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:41,117
And the night has only begun.

708
00:47:47,424 --> 00:47:50,794
Master, what did we decide about this?

709
00:47:52,497 --> 00:47:54,165
Come on, I really want to.

710
00:47:54,232 --> 00:47:56,067
Well, believe me, so do I.

711
00:48:03,542 --> 00:48:05,679
But, I can’t, I can’t.

712
00:48:06,513 --> 00:48:07,614
Sure you can.

713
00:48:07,681 --> 00:48:09,617
No, Dana, I can’t.

714
00:48:09,684 --> 00:48:11,219
Well, what’s the matter?

715
00:48:11,285 --> 00:48:14,689
I don’t feel right about it. I don’t feel right about it.

716
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:37,115
Okay, 15 bingo sets, you got it.

717
00:48:39,886 --> 00:48:41,354
This is ridiculous.

718
00:48:42,188 --> 00:48:44,924
You’re doing the right thing.

719
00:48:44,991 --> 00:48:46,627
Did you see the way she looked at me back there?

720
00:48:46,693 --> 00:48:48,662
She must think I have a disease or, something.

721
00:48:48,729 --> 00:48:52,167
Master, she looks at you that way because you’re special.

722
00:48:52,233 --> 00:48:53,268
[scoffs]

723
00:48:53,334 --> 00:48:56,771
It’s going beautifully. Trust me.

724
00:49:03,412 --> 00:49:05,482
I wonder what they wanted with the bingo sets?

725
00:49:06,850 --> 00:49:08,151
They scare me.

726
00:49:09,954 --> 00:49:13,825
Get ready. B 9, that’s B 9.

727
00:49:14,992 --> 00:49:17,262
I won! I won! I won!

728
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:19,398
[all cheering]

729
00:49:19,465 --> 00:49:20,732
I can’t believe I won!

730
00:49:21,968 --> 00:49:23,269
[both] Bingo!

731
00:49:24,904 --> 00:49:26,706
We lust for bingo!

732
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:32,179
Play from your heart, like this.

733
00:49:37,352 --> 00:49:38,587
Thanks, Gus.

734
00:49:46,964 --> 00:49:48,298
Popcorn?

735
00:49:48,765 --> 00:49:49,867
Thanks.

736
00:50:02,848 --> 00:50:06,853
You know, Jeanie, you’re a lot more than a genie to me.

737
00:50:08,989 --> 00:50:10,191
You’re also a good friend.

738
00:50:11,559 --> 00:50:13,227
Thanks, Master.

739
00:50:17,032 --> 00:50:18,400
I love when you do that.

740
00:50:32,449 --> 00:50:33,852
I found the girl of my dreams.

741
00:50:41,561 --> 00:50:44,897
And I have you to thank for it. Good night.

742
00:51:03,118 --> 00:51:06,957
Chopper’s on its way. You’ll be out of here in no time.

743
00:51:10,795 --> 00:51:11,896
How did you find me?

744
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:13,998
It was your cologne.

745
00:51:18,704 --> 00:51:23,042
[man] Cut! Excellent! Dana, terrific day, terrific.

746
00:51:26,145 --> 00:51:27,548
Isn’t she incredible?

747
00:51:32,119 --> 00:51:33,655
I’ll be right back.

748
00:51:37,025 --> 00:51:39,762
Scotty? Hey, hot damn. How you doing?

749
00:51:39,829 --> 00:51:41,430
Man, listen, can I borrow her for a sec?

750
00:51:41,497 --> 00:51:43,065
-Sure, go ahead. -Okay.

751
00:51:43,132 --> 00:51:46,136
Hey, remember the time we took the Mahoney twins

752
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:48,772
up to that cabin in Big Sur? That was some caper, huh?

753
00:51:50,207 --> 00:51:51,609
Mahoney twins?

754
00:51:52,577 --> 00:51:54,946
Jeanie. Jeanie?

755
00:51:55,013 --> 00:51:56,648
[Benjamin] Mr. Burbank. Mr. Burbank.

756
00:51:56,714 --> 00:51:57,983
Yes, what do you want, bozo?

757
00:51:58,050 --> 00:51:59,852
I finished that idea I was looking at.

758
00:51:59,918 --> 00:52:04,090
The Italian boxer who gets sent back to the past to murder the future...

759
00:52:04,157 --> 00:52:05,392
Yeah, yeah, that’s it.

760
00:52:05,458 --> 00:52:07,494
I hate it, it’s stupid, you’re stupid.

761
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:08,662
Burbank!

762
00:52:08,728 --> 00:52:10,564
Sir, I thought you were at the studio.

763
00:52:10,631 --> 00:52:12,667
Burbank, I am the studio.

764
00:52:12,733 --> 00:52:14,969
I want that building. Write it off to the Hudson Two budget.

765
00:52:15,036 --> 00:52:16,605
Burbank, why are you anywhere?

766
00:52:16,672 --> 00:52:19,975
Well, I was talking to Mr. Benjamin about his idea and...

767
00:52:20,042 --> 00:52:21,176
The one about the Italian boxer?

768
00:52:21,243 --> 00:52:22,712
Yeah, yeah, that’s it.

769
00:52:22,779 --> 00:52:24,580
I love it!

770
00:52:24,647 --> 00:52:28,952
Oh, yeah, me too. Our idea is brilliant.

771
00:52:29,019 --> 00:52:31,355
I liked it from the very first. Here, have some money.

772
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:35,093
I’ll give you this and my gas card,

773
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:36,394
you can fill your tank up.

774
00:52:36,461 --> 00:52:38,463
Here you go, Price Club. You’ve heard of that.

775
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,633
Knock yourself out. Okay. Thank you

776
00:52:48,942 --> 00:52:52,080
I’ve been hoping I’d get a chance to work with you for a long time now.

777
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:53,948
Yes.

778
00:52:54,015 --> 00:52:56,117
I think we can do great things together.

779
00:52:59,655 --> 00:53:01,423
I think so, too.

780
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:04,094
Could you help with this?

781
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:05,662
It seems to be a little stuck.

782
00:53:10,735 --> 00:53:11,969
My goodness.

783
00:53:20,879 --> 00:53:22,381
Guess what?

784
00:53:22,448 --> 00:53:25,852
Donald wants me to come in next week for a screen test.

785
00:53:25,918 --> 00:53:27,654
That’s great, Dana, I’m sure you’ll do well.

786
00:53:27,721 --> 00:53:29,857
And I owe it all to you for introducing us.

787
00:53:32,059 --> 00:53:33,795
Dinner tonight? My place?

788
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:37,699
I don’t know. You sure you don’t wanna have dinner with Donald?

789
00:53:39,234 --> 00:53:40,936
Are you kidding, Scotty?

790
00:53:41,003 --> 00:53:44,774
Well, that old fossil couldn’t even make bat boy in your league.

791
00:54:04,764 --> 00:54:09,002
Lars! Brain dead! The weather is bad, there’s no waves.

792
00:54:09,068 --> 00:54:10,070
What are we doing out here?

793
00:54:10,137 --> 00:54:11,639
Just shut up, all right? Kenny! Dude!

794
00:54:11,705 --> 00:54:14,608
I’m so glad you could make it, man. Check it out.

795
00:54:14,675 --> 00:54:15,844
It’s a day of judgment, man.

796
00:54:15,911 --> 00:54:18,480
I want you to go out there and do me proud.

797
00:54:19,915 --> 00:54:21,651
Well, is there any way of doing this

798
00:54:21,717 --> 00:54:24,520
without actually going into the water?

799
00:54:27,391 --> 00:54:30,828
No, it’s kind of, part of the deal, you got to...

800
00:54:31,695 --> 00:54:32,830
Right.

801
00:54:32,896 --> 00:54:34,132
All right, Kenny!

802
00:54:38,002 --> 00:54:41,106
Okay, Kenny. Next step

803
00:54:41,173 --> 00:54:44,710
is to wait for that perfect wave.

804
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:52,153
Jeanie, I’ve been thinking about this all day,

805
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:54,655
and I know that your plans for Dana and I have worked great,

806
00:54:54,722 --> 00:54:57,526
but, I’ve decided it is time to go for it.

807
00:54:58,994 --> 00:55:00,662
It still might be a little early.

808
00:55:00,729 --> 00:55:02,130
The timing is right, I’m sure of it.

809
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:08,671
Master, are you sure that her feelings for you are genuine?

810
00:55:08,738 --> 00:55:10,941
Of course. Did you see her today? It was like magic.

811
00:55:16,348 --> 00:55:19,184
Okay. When are you planning on making your move?

812
00:55:20,385 --> 00:55:22,355
Tonight, at her place.

813
00:55:22,421 --> 00:55:25,224
Oh, the guys need some waves, Jeanie.

814
00:55:25,291 --> 00:55:29,296
Lars, is my hair actually going to get wet?

815
00:55:30,464 --> 00:55:31,965
[screaming]

816
00:55:38,873 --> 00:55:40,276
So, do you have a strategy

817
00:55:40,342 --> 00:55:42,177
or are you just planning to wing it with her?

818
00:55:42,244 --> 00:55:43,545
I’m glad you asked that.

819
00:55:43,612 --> 00:55:46,049
’Cause that is actually an excellent question.

820
00:55:47,817 --> 00:55:49,252
I thought that after dinner,

821
00:55:49,319 --> 00:55:51,756
we’d have a couple of glasses of wine,

822
00:55:51,822 --> 00:55:55,259
and then I’d give her a really sensual massage.

823
00:55:55,326 --> 00:55:56,894
And you want me to make you

824
00:55:56,961 --> 00:55:58,697
the best masseuse in the world, right?

825
00:55:58,764 --> 00:55:59,865
Exactly.

826
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:05,672
Well, I can make you a great masseuse,

827
00:56:05,738 --> 00:56:10,744
but, you’re still gonna have to practice.

828
00:56:10,811 --> 00:56:12,780
Practice when? I want this to happen tonight.

829
00:56:17,819 --> 00:56:21,022
I know, I’m about the same age

830
00:56:21,089 --> 00:56:23,793
and about the same build as Dana...

831
00:56:25,261 --> 00:56:26,696
You can practice on me.

832
00:56:32,803 --> 00:56:34,005
Massage away, Master.

833
00:56:45,552 --> 00:56:46,920
You really think this will work?

834
00:56:47,854 --> 00:56:52,994
Definitely. Your fingers are magic, Scotty.

835
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:55,863
You know, that’s the first time you ever called me Scotty.

836
00:56:55,930 --> 00:56:57,265
I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to.

837
00:56:57,332 --> 00:56:58,300
It’s okay, it’s okay.

838
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:00,235
Anything’s better than Master.

839
00:57:06,442 --> 00:57:09,246
I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to...

840
00:57:09,313 --> 00:57:11,782
Scotty, wait. It’s okay, really.

841
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:14,718
Scotty, you don’t have to leave.

842
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:18,957
Okay. I got to go.

843
00:57:19,357 --> 00:57:20,325
Scotty.

844
00:57:26,298 --> 00:57:31,138
So, where are we headed tonight?

845
00:57:33,141 --> 00:57:35,276
Are you sure? I mean, on your big night?

846
00:57:35,343 --> 00:57:36,711
What if you need something?

847
00:57:36,778 --> 00:57:39,113
This is definitely a situation I can handle on my own.

848
00:57:39,181 --> 00:57:40,182
Don’t wait up.

849
00:57:42,851 --> 00:57:43,952
Hello.

850
00:57:47,557 --> 00:57:49,559
[man on TV] At last, we can be together.

851
00:57:49,626 --> 00:57:50,493
[woman on TV] Forever.

852
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,196
[man on TV] I love you.

853
00:57:52,263 --> 00:57:53,297
And I love you.

854
00:58:03,242 --> 00:58:06,579
You don’t have to hate me because I have beautiful hair.

855
00:58:06,646 --> 00:58:09,883
I don’t, I hate you because you’re a conniving sleaze bag.

856
00:58:09,950 --> 00:58:12,953
You can have beautiful hair, too.

857
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:16,424
La Femme Sauvage. Just try it for a month.

858
00:58:16,491 --> 00:58:17,959
Who needs men?

859
00:58:22,398 --> 00:58:24,467
[muffled] I hate this!

860
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,440
You know, Dana, you feel a little tense.

861
00:58:33,177 --> 00:58:35,413
Don’t tell me you give the world’s greatest massage.

862
00:58:36,514 --> 00:58:39,251
Let’s just say, I wish I did.

863
00:58:44,223 --> 00:58:45,792
[gun fire on TV]

864
00:58:49,662 --> 00:58:51,365
...Ignoring the detour.

865
00:58:52,433 --> 00:58:53,901
[woman screaming]

866
00:59:01,009 --> 00:59:02,577
Cool. Clippers.

867
00:59:02,644 --> 00:59:04,514
[announcer] Gary Grant brings the ball up three on two

868
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:06,916
and he throws the ball away again.

869
00:59:06,983 --> 00:59:08,985
Coach Schuler is not pleased. He certainly isn’t.

870
00:59:09,052 --> 00:59:10,521
Oh, come on!

871
00:59:10,587 --> 00:59:12,589
...the ball to Charles Smith who goes up for the shot

872
00:59:12,656 --> 00:59:14,925
and he is rejected by Reggie Lewis.

873
00:59:14,992 --> 00:59:21,901
Another one and another...

874
00:59:21,967 --> 00:59:23,335
I thought Scotty needed help! This isn’t the kind of night

875
00:59:23,402 --> 00:59:26,138
we expected from Gary Grant. Young superstar...

876
00:59:27,207 --> 00:59:30,410
Gary, Gary, we need a lift here.

877
00:59:30,477 --> 00:59:32,579
Forget all that perimeter crap.

878
00:59:33,281 --> 00:59:35,383
I want you throwing bows,

879
00:59:35,449 --> 00:59:38,252
and then driving strong to the hull, got it?

880
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:39,421
Got it!

881
00:59:41,723 --> 00:59:44,560
Well, then go get them!

882
00:59:44,626 --> 00:59:46,763
[announcer] McHale drives a baseline, puts up a jump,

883
00:59:46,829 --> 00:59:51,468
rejected by Charles Smith. Out to Ken Norman who pushes it forward to Gary Grant,

884
00:59:51,535 --> 00:59:52,870
from out of nowhere.

885
00:59:52,937 --> 00:59:57,375
Slam dunk, Gary Grant. Oh, my, time out, Celtics.

886
01:00:12,726 --> 01:00:14,094
Could you help with this?

887
01:00:57,846 --> 01:01:01,116
You have no idea how long I’ve been waiting for this.

888
01:01:15,566 --> 01:01:17,201
Help you out of these?

889
01:01:17,268 --> 01:01:18,670
Just give them a tug.

890
01:01:24,543 --> 01:01:25,711
Velcro underwear?

891
01:01:38,893 --> 01:01:40,262
Finally.

892
01:01:42,764 --> 01:01:44,199
Mom?

893
01:01:44,266 --> 01:01:46,202
Whatever happened to Jodi Buxbombe from the 8th grade?

894
01:01:46,269 --> 01:01:47,570
I really liked her.

895
01:01:47,637 --> 01:01:48,604
[exclaims in disgust]

896
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:51,809
Mac!

897
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:53,777
I told you she was out of your league!

898
01:01:53,844 --> 01:01:55,746
You want me to take over from here?

899
01:01:55,813 --> 01:01:57,015
-Grandma! -Don’t forget

900
01:01:57,082 --> 01:01:59,551
to wash your hands when you’re through.

901
01:01:59,851 --> 01:02:01,319
Yuck!

902
01:02:19,941 --> 01:02:21,176
Well, hi!

903
01:02:21,243 --> 01:02:24,313
Hi.

904
01:02:26,415 --> 01:02:27,384
Young lady...

905
01:02:28,752 --> 01:02:31,721
Do you at all realize what could possibly happen to you

906
01:02:31,788 --> 01:02:34,325
if you continue to ignore the genie regulations?

907
01:02:34,392 --> 01:02:35,393
But, I had to do it.

908
01:02:35,459 --> 01:02:37,128
He was gonna sleep with her!

909
01:02:37,194 --> 01:02:38,796
No, no, I’m sorry.

910
01:02:38,863 --> 01:02:41,666
Genies are not permitted to interfere with their master’s lives

911
01:02:41,733 --> 01:02:43,869
unless they’re instructed to do so.

912
01:02:43,935 --> 01:02:46,906
I’m trying to save him from getting hurt.

913
01:02:46,973 --> 01:02:50,176
There are certain rules, Jeanie, and you’re forbidden to interfere!

914
01:02:50,243 --> 01:02:51,612
But, I love him!

915
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:53,380
Does he love you?

916
01:02:55,949 --> 01:02:57,919
-Well, that depends. -Depends?

917
01:02:57,986 --> 01:03:01,489
It’s a simple question, Jeanie. Does he love you?

918
01:03:02,557 --> 01:03:05,127
I’m sure he does, he just doesn’t know it yet.

919
01:03:05,761 --> 01:03:07,496
Oh, oh, oh.

920
01:03:08,297 --> 01:03:10,467
You know the rules, Jeanie.

921
01:03:10,534 --> 01:03:14,438
Unless he professes his love for you, you are duty-bound

922
01:03:14,504 --> 01:03:16,174
to grant him everything he wishes!

923
01:03:16,941 --> 01:03:19,243
Don’t start with the tears, now.

924
01:03:19,777 --> 01:03:20,879
I don’t like that.

925
01:03:21,613 --> 01:03:23,148
Am I clear on this?

926
01:03:23,582 --> 01:03:24,616
Yes, sir.

927
01:03:25,751 --> 01:03:26,886
Good.

928
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:29,456
[sighs]

929
01:03:31,257 --> 01:03:33,227
I hope you realize what happens to you next time.

930
01:03:33,294 --> 01:03:34,462
If this happens again,

931
01:03:35,296 --> 01:03:37,798
do you know that you lose your powers

932
01:03:37,865 --> 01:03:40,235
and you’re banished to your lamp for all eternity?

933
01:03:41,570 --> 01:03:43,705
Yes, yes, that, you can cry over.

934
01:03:47,710 --> 01:03:50,646
[announcer] The swimsuit competition will begin in two hours.

935
01:03:52,983 --> 01:03:56,220
I don’t know, Soup. I don’t think that Miss Uruguay’s

936
01:03:56,286 --> 01:03:58,723
even gonna fit into a 34DD, man.

937
01:03:58,790 --> 01:04:01,192
Oh, she’s got a huge personality.

938
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:05,898
Do you like that? You can keep it.

939
01:04:05,965 --> 01:04:09,536
Take care of Miss Great Britain’s, I’m gonna...

940
01:04:09,603 --> 01:04:12,973
OK, all right, all right, long, silky great hair,

941
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:15,443
and light golden skin.

942
01:04:15,510 --> 01:04:17,245
Let’s put her in a light top

943
01:04:17,311 --> 01:04:21,216
with a little bow to cover that mole she has, huh? What do you think?

944
01:04:22,751 --> 01:04:23,919
So how was last night?

945
01:04:26,355 --> 01:04:29,492
I decided that the timing wasn’t really right after all.

946
01:04:30,793 --> 01:04:32,028
Are you gonna see her today?

947
01:04:32,095 --> 01:04:33,998
She’s with her sister.

948
01:04:34,064 --> 01:04:35,766
At least, that’s what she told me.

949
01:04:37,601 --> 01:04:40,539
Can you believe that? After she told me last night

950
01:04:40,605 --> 01:04:43,642
about how I was everything to her?

951
01:04:43,708 --> 01:04:47,280
Scotty, a girl like that is never gonna settle down with one guy.

952
01:04:48,948 --> 01:04:50,316
What should I do?

953
01:04:51,818 --> 01:04:54,321
I think you should try and find someone else.

954
01:04:54,955 --> 01:04:56,156
You know, I mean,

955
01:04:56,223 --> 01:04:58,993
love isn’t something that you look for.

956
01:04:59,394 --> 01:05:00,995
It just happens.

957
01:05:03,699 --> 01:05:04,867
Maybe you’re right.

958
01:05:07,603 --> 01:05:08,704
Unless...

959
01:05:08,772 --> 01:05:10,206
Unless what?

960
01:05:10,273 --> 01:05:12,909
Unless I can show her that two can play at that game,

961
01:05:12,976 --> 01:05:14,745
and she just might lose me.

962
01:05:14,812 --> 01:05:15,913
What are you talking about?

963
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:17,648
I’m talking about making her jealous.

964
01:05:17,715 --> 01:05:18,683
How?

965
01:05:18,749 --> 01:05:20,117
With another girl.

966
01:05:20,184 --> 01:05:23,088
Now, if I could just find some girl that wouldn’t mind

967
01:05:23,155 --> 01:05:25,524
standing in as my girlfriend.

968
01:05:26,859 --> 01:05:27,961
You?

969
01:05:28,027 --> 01:05:29,329
Why not?

970
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:32,498
I wouldn’t wanna use you like that.

971
01:05:32,565 --> 01:05:35,669
Oh, come on, what are genies for?

972
01:05:35,736 --> 01:05:39,474
All right. I wish you were visible.

973
01:05:47,817 --> 01:05:48,918
Bye, darling.

974
01:05:54,791 --> 01:05:56,627
Scotty. Hi.

975
01:05:58,096 --> 01:06:00,098
Your sister’s cute.

976
01:06:00,164 --> 01:06:03,435
She’s a little masculine for my taste.

977
01:06:03,502 --> 01:06:05,137
Look, Scotty, I know what you’re thinking

978
01:06:05,204 --> 01:06:07,006
-and it’s all totally... -It’s all right, Dana,

979
01:06:07,072 --> 01:06:08,307
I understand.

980
01:06:08,641 --> 01:06:09,843
Really?

981
01:06:09,909 --> 01:06:11,511
-Really. -Hi.

982
01:06:17,218 --> 01:06:18,953
I’m Jeanie. You can call me Jen.

983
01:06:20,421 --> 01:06:23,558
And how come I haven’t seen you around here before?

984
01:06:23,625 --> 01:06:26,028
Oh, Scotty keeps me pretty bottled up.

985
01:06:26,094 --> 01:06:27,964
[both laughing]

986
01:06:28,031 --> 01:06:32,435
If you don’t mind, I’d like to have a few words with Scotty in private.

987
01:06:32,502 --> 01:06:34,905
Oh, of course, sweetie.

988
01:06:34,972 --> 01:06:36,840
Don’t be too late now, sugar.

989
01:06:36,907 --> 01:06:37,941
Okay.

990
01:06:42,247 --> 01:06:45,618
Okay, you win. I won’t see him anymore.

991
01:06:46,619 --> 01:06:48,154
Who was he?

992
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:52,359
He’s just an old boyfriend. It’s over. It’s over.

993
01:06:55,662 --> 01:06:57,131
Where did you find that?

994
01:06:58,633 --> 01:06:59,801
She’s an old friend.

995
01:07:01,636 --> 01:07:02,805
We’re gonna go over to the beach club

996
01:07:02,871 --> 01:07:04,773
and watch the competition, you wanna come?

997
01:07:06,608 --> 01:07:07,576
No, I don’t think so.

998
01:07:07,643 --> 01:07:10,880
Of which you could be a contestant.

999
01:07:10,947 --> 01:07:11,915
Oh, come on.

1000
01:07:11,981 --> 01:07:13,516
No, really.

1001
01:07:13,583 --> 01:07:15,419
Well, all right.

1002
01:07:16,754 --> 01:07:17,955
Okay.

1003
01:07:25,797 --> 01:07:28,634
[announcer] Here they are, ladies and gentlemen, from all over the world,

1004
01:07:28,701 --> 01:07:30,636
the Miss International beauty contestants.

1005
01:07:30,703 --> 01:07:32,438
[crowd cheering and howling]

1006
01:07:34,608 --> 01:07:36,677
[Soup] Excuse me, please, excuse me, judges.

1007
01:07:36,744 --> 01:07:38,880
-[Lars] Sorry. -Judges, judges.

1008
01:07:38,947 --> 01:07:40,648
[Sure Looks Good To Me plays]

1009
01:08:24,166 --> 01:08:26,568
Beautiful betties as far as the eye can see.

1010
01:08:34,244 --> 01:08:35,979
Miss Brazil, she’s...

1011
01:08:36,046 --> 01:08:38,549
[speaking Spanish]

1012
01:08:38,616 --> 01:08:40,251
Who’s this girl? She’s not on the list.

1013
01:08:46,959 --> 01:08:48,527
I know that face.

1014
01:08:51,698 --> 01:08:52,933
Jeanie!

1015
01:08:52,999 --> 01:08:54,034
It’s Jeanie!

1016
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:55,702
[both] That’s our genie!

1017
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:03,278
Jeanie!

1018
01:09:12,655 --> 01:09:13,957
-She’s cute. -What!

1019
01:09:18,062 --> 01:09:21,299
Take one more good look at the six finalists, ladies and gentlemen,

1020
01:09:21,366 --> 01:09:23,869
’cause the judges have made their decision.

1021
01:09:23,935 --> 01:09:25,704
[crowd cheering and applauding]

1022
01:09:38,151 --> 01:09:39,387
And the winner of this year’s

1023
01:09:39,454 --> 01:09:42,323
Miss International swimsuit competition is

1024
01:09:47,162 --> 01:09:50,232
Miss Fantasy-land, Jeanie Peterson.

1025
01:09:51,301 --> 01:09:53,036
[all cheering]

1026
01:09:54,471 --> 01:09:55,772
Hey. Way to go, Jeanie.

1027
01:10:07,352 --> 01:10:09,088
[crowd cheering wildly]

1028
01:10:11,491 --> 01:10:13,159
Jeanie! Jeanie!

1029
01:10:15,462 --> 01:10:18,832
Jeanie! Jeanie!

1030
01:10:18,899 --> 01:10:21,336
Jeanie, get down from there. Come on. What are you doing?

1031
01:10:25,340 --> 01:10:27,009
What was that all about?

1032
01:10:27,076 --> 01:10:29,211
I thought you wanted me to go to the contest.

1033
01:10:29,278 --> 01:10:30,913
Not to be in it.

1034
01:10:30,980 --> 01:10:32,448
Why are you still visible?

1035
01:10:32,516 --> 01:10:33,784
You never wished me back.

1036
01:10:33,850 --> 01:10:36,787
Well, I wish you were back the way you were. God.

1037
01:10:36,853 --> 01:10:38,990
Your wish is my command, Master.

1038
01:10:40,925 --> 01:10:42,226
Good, you know, I don’t get it.

1039
01:10:42,293 --> 01:10:44,763
One minute, you’re helping me to get Dana to commit

1040
01:10:44,830 --> 01:10:45,898
her faithfulness to me, the next minute,

1041
01:10:45,965 --> 01:10:48,167
you’re acting like this lunatic.

1042
01:10:48,233 --> 01:10:51,037
Do you really think she’ll ever be faithful to you?

1043
01:10:51,104 --> 01:10:52,872
Hey, why wouldn’t she be faithful to me?

1044
01:10:52,939 --> 01:10:54,374
It’s not her style.

1045
01:10:54,441 --> 01:10:55,709
How do you know?

1046
01:10:55,775 --> 01:10:57,745
She wears Velcro panties.

1047
01:10:57,812 --> 01:10:58,846
So...

1048
01:11:02,350 --> 01:11:03,919
You were there. You were there, weren’t you?

1049
01:11:04,586 --> 01:11:08,423
Weren’t you? Answer me!

1050
01:11:08,491 --> 01:11:10,960
I was just trying to keep you from getting hurt.

1051
01:11:11,027 --> 01:11:13,730
Tonight is a very special night for Dana and me.

1052
01:11:13,796 --> 01:11:15,766
I don’t want you to grant me any more wishes.

1053
01:11:15,833 --> 01:11:18,268
I don’t even want you hear me, do you understand?

1054
01:11:18,335 --> 01:11:20,404
No more wishes, no more tricks.

1055
01:11:20,472 --> 01:11:22,741
I will handle this evening alone, you got it?

1056
01:11:24,342 --> 01:11:25,777
Yes, Master.

1057
01:11:27,046 --> 01:11:28,681
Good, good.

1058
01:11:46,502 --> 01:11:47,870
I think you know why I’m here.

1059
01:11:53,576 --> 01:11:56,179
Your banishment begins tonight at midnight.

1060
01:11:56,246 --> 01:11:59,483
Another genie will be assigned to Scotty at that time.

1061
01:11:59,550 --> 01:12:03,255
You did it yourself, young lady. I warned you.

1062
01:12:06,391 --> 01:12:07,359
[crying]

1063
01:13:00,354 --> 01:13:03,358
Darling, I don’t think we’ll be able to go ice fishing this time of year.

1064
01:13:03,425 --> 01:13:05,060
Isn’t there anything you can do?

1065
01:13:06,027 --> 01:13:07,395
Where’s Jeanie?

1066
01:13:07,462 --> 01:13:09,132
She is in her lamp.

1067
01:13:09,699 --> 01:13:12,168
Jeanie! Babe!

1068
01:13:12,235 --> 01:13:15,873
You got to pull off the ultimate wish for us!

1069
01:13:15,939 --> 01:13:17,641
I’m afraid Jeanie’s not gonna be granting

1070
01:13:17,708 --> 01:13:19,009
any wishes tonight.

1071
01:13:19,076 --> 01:13:21,379
What? Why?

1072
01:13:21,446 --> 01:13:23,281
She’s in deep trouble with the genie people

1073
01:13:23,348 --> 01:13:24,716
and she’s being sent back.

1074
01:13:24,783 --> 01:13:27,486
Wait, but, what about our wishes? We need her now.

1075

Well, I guess you’re gonna have to ask the new genie,

1077
01:13:32,959 --> 01:13:34,394
who should be here about midnight.

1078
01:13:34,928 --> 01:13:37,464

1080
01:13:58,322 --> 01:14:01,926

[Scotty] Hi, remember me from the other day?

1157
01:19:58,575 --> 01:19:59,676
I asked you about genies?

01:20:00,811 --> 01:20:02,680
-Yes. -Yeah, well, I...

01:20:08,854 --> 01:20:10,589
What’s the problem now?

1161
01:20:10,656 --> 01:20:13,058
Okay, I wished for my genie

1162
01:20:13,125 --> 01:20:14,761
not to be able to hear me for the rest of the night

1163
01:20:14,828 --> 01:20:16,496
but, now, I have something to tell her.

1164
01:20:17,464 --> 01:20:19,432
Look.

1165
01:20:19,499 --> 01:20:22,603
In two minutes, it will be officially tomorrow.

1166
01:20:22,670 --> 01:20:24,472
Why don’t you just wait and tell her then?

1167
01:20:24,538 --> 01:20:25,640
No. Because, at midnight,

1168
01:20:25,706 --> 01:20:27,275
she’s being replaced by a new genie

1169
01:20:27,342 --> 01:20:30,445
and banished to her bottle for interfering with my wishes.

1170
01:20:30,512 --> 01:20:31,446
So say what you have to say

1171
01:20:31,513 --> 01:20:33,082
to the new genie after midnight.

1172
01:20:33,149 --> 01:20:34,250
No, no.

1173
01:20:34,317 --> 01:20:35,885
I don’t wanna say it to the new genie.

I was so blind

1175
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:38,922
that I thought I wanted to say it to someone else,

1176
01:20:38,989 --> 01:20:42,393
but, all along, it was my genie that I wanted to say it to.

1177
01:20:43,060 --> 01:20:44,329
What can I do?

1178
01:20:44,396 --> 01:20:48,500
Just say what you have to say. It’s that simple.

1179
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:50,670
But, she can’t hear me.

1180
01:20:51,203 --> 01:20:52,438
She can.

1181
01:20:53,906 --> 01:20:54,974
Believe me.

1182
01:20:57,644 --> 01:20:59,046
You realize that if you say

1183
01:20:59,112 --> 01:21:00,747
what you have to say to a genie,

1184
01:21:00,814 --> 01:21:02,784
they immediately lose all their power

1185
01:21:02,850 --> 01:21:06,554
and become as normal as you or, I.

1186
01:21:07,755 --> 01:21:11,193
And you lose everything that was granted to you

1187
01:21:11,260 --> 01:21:13,729
or anyone else since you found her.

01:21:14,564 --> 01:21:15,565
