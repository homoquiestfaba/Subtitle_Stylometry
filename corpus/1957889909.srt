1
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:27,962
You have to learn
to fight for yourself.

2
00:00:27,996 --> 00:00:29,129
I won't always be around.

3
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:30,665
Don't say that. Yes, you will.

4
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:32,332
I don't know
what I would do without you.

5
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,334
You're a strong woman,
you take after me.

6
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:35,970
- I do?
- Yes.

7
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:40,708
Whoa! Mom!

8
00:00:40,742 --> 00:00:43,043
Yes, but this isn't always
the most effective weapon.

9
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:44,612
It runs out of bullets.

10
00:00:44,646 --> 00:00:47,682
- Where did you get a gun?
- It doesn't matter.

11
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:50,552
All right, now, if a horde
of zombies comes at you,

12
00:00:50,585 --> 00:00:52,554
you got to use
everything and anything

13
00:00:52,587 --> 00:00:54,354
you can get your hands on
to throw at them

14
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,658
or bash their brains in.
Grab a saucepan like this,

15
00:00:56,691 --> 00:00:58,560
hopefully there's
some hot grease in there

16
00:00:58,593 --> 00:01:00,360
and just swing it at them,
just swing it

17
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:01,461
at their head, okay?

18
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:02,530
That's an option,

19
00:01:02,564 --> 00:01:04,599
or you can use a knife,

20
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,467
okay?

21
00:01:07,502 --> 00:01:09,637
But not a serrated one
because it will get stuck.

22
00:01:09,671 --> 00:01:11,039
You can use this phone cord.

23
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,707
You can just grab it,
pull it tight,

24
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,408
wrap it
around the zombie's head,

25
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:16,711
pull and just... just choke him!

26
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:18,478
- Choke him with the phone cord.
- Okay.

27
00:01:18,513 --> 00:01:20,314
Choke him. That's what you do,
that's what you do, honey.

28
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:21,983
- Okay.
- Okay. Hang on,

29
00:01:22,016 --> 00:01:23,818
there's something else.
There's this.

30
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:25,587
- Whoa!
- Yes.

31
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,056
Just take this and just cut
their fucking heads off.

32
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,692
Just... Just... Just right over,
right through their neck,

33
00:01:30,725 --> 00:01:32,660
right through their neck.

34
00:01:32,694 --> 00:01:35,429
- Doesn't that need electricity?
- Oh, this one runs on gas.

35
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:37,097
That's why I keep
the gas can over there.

36
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,165
- Oh!
- Mm-hmm.

37
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:43,337
- Okay. What about the bottle?
- Oh, shit, that's for me.

38
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,773
It's for my nerves,
you know, it is the apocalypse.

39
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,446
Oh, okay.

40
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:55,883
Ah, that works.

41
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,587
Come here, listen,
repeat after me.

42
00:01:59,621 --> 00:02:02,857
Okay? I am a strong woman.

43
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,192
I am a strong woman.

44
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:07,260
- I am a strong woman.
- I am a strong woman.

45
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,697
- One more time.
- I am a strong woman.

46
00:02:09,731 --> 00:02:12,734
Yes! I am a strong woman.

47
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,270
Hey.

48
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,441
- Oh.
- Ah.

49
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:33,554
- Andrea.
- I'll be there in a second.

50
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:54,307
<i>Andrea, Thanksgiving meal.</i>

51
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:57,411
<i>You leave the stove on
all the time.</i>

52
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:00,648
I'm gonna miss the show.

53
00:03:02,717 --> 00:03:04,819
<i>Hey, maybe I'm gonna bash
some zombies' brains...</i>

54
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:06,521
But, Timmy,
why are you eating my food?

55
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:07,822
- Guys.
- Hmm?

56
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,693
I want to watch the zombie
show with Doris and Marcus!

57
00:03:11,726 --> 00:03:13,226
They always
get to watch it without me.

58
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,182
What do you think?
Not bad for canned food

59
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,382
for Thanksgiving dinner.

60
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:37,317
Thanksgiving lunch,

61
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,887
and why don't we go to the beach
like we always do as a family?

62
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,194
We can't.
It's not safe at the beach.

63
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,102
Ow!

64
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:55,603
I miss Dad.

65
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,417
Let's say a prayer, shall we?

66
00:04:12,053 --> 00:04:13,087
Shall we?

67
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:17,992
Mm-hmm.

68
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:20,260
Dear Father in Heaven,
we thank you

69
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:22,597
for your blessings
and your graces.

70
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,866
We thank you
for our food, shelter,

71
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:27,702
and health,
and we especially thank you

72
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:29,670
for our family
during this apocalypse.

73
00:04:29,704 --> 00:04:30,838
We thank you for...

74
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:37,945
No phones at the table, please.

75
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,184
Can you put
the volume up, please?

76
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:46,220
Mom, turn it down.

77
00:04:46,254 --> 00:04:49,157
<i>Andrea, stay out of my closet.</i>

78
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:52,627
<i>Just 'cause the world's ending
doesn't mean I have to ask you "please."</i>

79
00:04:55,096 --> 00:04:56,898
Damn it! One bar.

80
00:04:56,931 --> 00:04:59,600
Look, I understand your need
to feel connected,

81
00:04:59,634 --> 00:05:01,569
but I am right here
and there's nothing

82
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:03,303
more important
than spending time

83
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:06,040
with your family
during the Thanksgiving meal.

84
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:08,876
Thanksgiving lunch,
and Dad is dead.

85
00:05:10,845 --> 00:05:14,447
Don't you dare talk
about your dad like that!

86
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,617
I will talk about my father
whenever I want!

87
00:05:16,651 --> 00:05:18,286
Don't sass me, young lady!

88
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,588
- You go to your room!
- I <i>will</i> go to my room

89
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:22,322
because I want
to charge my phone!

90
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:24,792
And don't come out
until you've apologized!

91
00:05:24,826 --> 00:05:26,894
I'm not gonna apologize!

92
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,364
And don't break everything
like you did last time.

93
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:34,135
<i>I'll break
whatever I want, bitch!</i>

94
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,590
- Yes!
<i>- Ah!</i>

95
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:57,592
Ah!

96
00:05:58,526 --> 00:05:59,492
Yes!

97
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:08,870
- Yes, yeah.
- Doris, you're in the way. I can't see the TV.

98
00:06:18,346 --> 00:06:19,412
Doris?

99
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:26,554
Doris? Doris, are you okay?

100
00:06:31,893 --> 00:06:32,860
Doris?

101
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:41,168
Frank? Frank?
Something's wrong, Frank.

102
00:06:41,202 --> 00:06:45,139
Frank! Frank, something's
wrong with Doris! Frank!

103
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:48,209
<i>Andrea! Andrea!</i>

104
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:29,083
If you can hear me,
I'm going to miss you, Doris.

105
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:32,753
I'm gonna miss you.

106
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:39,760
Bye.

107
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:01,716
Can we pray?

108
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:04,719
Sure.

109
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:09,557
Lord, we miss Doris

110
00:08:11,092 --> 00:08:14,962
and we ask that you send her
to watch over us tonight

111
00:08:14,996 --> 00:08:16,831
and help us have good dreams.

112
00:08:16,864 --> 00:08:18,666
- Amen.
- Amen.

113
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:26,374
Can you tuck me in?

114
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:32,880
Marcus, you're 23 years old.

115
00:08:41,956 --> 00:08:43,824
I miss her.

116
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:51,098
You still got me. We're family.

117
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:55,936
We're all God's children.
Brothers and sisters.

118
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,305
Do zombies have families?

119
00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:01,242
Hmm. Yes.

120
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,945
'Cause Jesus rose from the dead.

121
00:09:07,516 --> 00:09:11,018
Yes, Jesus was a zombie.

122
00:09:12,353 --> 00:09:15,056
- He was?
- Yes.

123
00:09:23,364 --> 00:09:26,801
Frank, can you leave
the light on?

124
00:09:29,103 --> 00:09:30,137
Sure.

125
00:09:31,172 --> 00:09:32,206
Good night, Marcus.

126
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:35,142
Good night, Alfredo.

127
00:09:58,567 --> 00:10:03,170
All right, guys. Fresh hot
eggs. Here you go, Timmy.

128
00:10:04,038 --> 00:10:05,507
There we go.

129
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,641
Marcus, there's something
for you there.

130
00:10:11,412 --> 00:10:12,446
Zombie brains.

131
00:10:20,488 --> 00:10:21,523
Gunshot.

132
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:34,034
Timmy, Doris isn't here anymore,
Timmy. She's gone.

133
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:35,736
Shut up!

134
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:36,804
Guys!

135
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:39,541
Calm down.

136
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,386
Hurry up.
Your day program is waiting.

137
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:57,258
Go to the program.
When you come back,

138
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:58,593
you can watch another episode.

139
00:10:58,627 --> 00:11:00,060
There's a big marathon
on tonight.

140
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:01,862
- All right?
- Okay.

141
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,566
All right.
All right, let me look at you.

142
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:08,369
That's what Mom would want.
All right, let me see you.

143
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,173
It's good. I like the tie
and green T-shirt.

144
00:11:12,206 --> 00:11:13,474
Thanks, Frank.

145
00:11:14,308 --> 00:11:16,810
All right, have a good day.

146
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:22,683
Andrea!

147
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:34,929
Andrea?

148
00:11:36,197 --> 00:11:38,132
Andrea! Andrea!

149
00:11:46,675 --> 00:11:48,342
Andrea!

150
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,377
- Mom, are you okay?
- Andrea!

151
00:11:50,411 --> 00:11:51,445
Mom?

152
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,519
Mom! Mom! Mom!

153
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,616
I gotta charge my phone.

154
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:33,053
Did I hear you say you like
brains?

155
00:12:33,087 --> 00:12:34,623
Yeah, I like brains.

156
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:41,228
- 'Cause I'm Captain Kill.
- I got brains in a capsule form.

157
00:12:41,262 --> 00:12:44,666
Oh, well, then,
give it to the specimen.

158
00:12:44,699 --> 00:12:46,767
Oh, no!

159
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,885
Marcus!

160
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:08,590
I thought I lost you.

161
00:13:11,726 --> 00:13:13,427
Marcus, Frank.

162
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,962
Hi, Nicole.

163
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:16,864
Nicole.

164
00:13:16,897 --> 00:13:19,066
I see you're still doing
the zombie thing.

165
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:23,804
Yeah, I, uh, Captain Kill
made me take my medication, see?

166
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:25,707
Captain Kill?

167
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:29,410
Nice, Frank, that's really nice.

168
00:13:29,443 --> 00:13:31,211
So, let's get started, okay?

169
00:13:32,681 --> 00:13:35,983
It's been a long time
since my last visit, clearly.

170
00:13:37,451 --> 00:13:40,220
We need to talk
about your behaviors.

171
00:13:40,254 --> 00:13:41,922
We need to discuss your goals.

172
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:44,458
I want a chainsaw
like Captain Kill.

173
00:13:45,527 --> 00:13:48,128
Okay, no,
you can't have a chainsaw.

174
00:13:48,162 --> 00:13:49,196
Anything else?

175
00:13:50,164 --> 00:13:52,701
I want to spend Thanksgiving
with my mama.

176
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:56,571
Wait, what?

177
00:13:56,604 --> 00:13:59,574
I want to spend
Thanksgiving with my mama

178
00:13:59,607 --> 00:14:04,178
to watch the last episode
of <i>Apocalyptic Zombies</i>

179
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:05,714
and have Thanksgiving lunch.

180
00:14:06,815 --> 00:14:08,717
Do you even know
your mother's name?

181
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:12,052
It's Mama.

182
00:14:14,455 --> 00:14:19,426
We'll see, Marcus, but the information
I have is probably out of date.

183
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:22,029
You may not be able to have
Thanksgiving dinner with her.

184
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:24,031
Thanksgiving lunch.

185
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:26,601
Okay, well, have a happy
Thanksgiving, Marcus,

186
00:14:26,634 --> 00:14:28,503
and I will see you
in three months.

187
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:33,173
And, Frank, I'm sorry
about your mother.

188
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:36,076
I'll miss Doris.

189
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,384
Well, I can... I can get a job
at the laundromat with Kim

190
00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:47,522
so I can make enough money
to earn a ticket to see my mama.

191
00:14:47,555 --> 00:14:50,725
Whoa, man, to join my family
has an initiation fee

192
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:52,126
of 23 years hard labor.

193
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:54,228
Bills are free, though.

194
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:59,400
Kim, can I get a job
at the laundromat?

195
00:15:01,402 --> 00:15:03,971
Is he serious?

196
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:10,277
Ah...

197
00:15:13,882 --> 00:15:15,884
Thank you, Kim!
Thank you, Kim! Thank you, Kim!

198
00:15:18,352 --> 00:15:21,155
Marcus. Sign out.
I'll see you for dinner.

199
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:26,728
Kim! Kim, what... what's it...
What's it like to have a family?

200
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:29,864
Do you sing songs together
at the dinner table?

201
00:15:29,898 --> 00:15:33,100
No. Dude, I sleep away
at the "laundry mat"

202
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:35,936
in between classes.
I basically don't have a life.

203
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:37,938
- Yeah, me neither.
- What are you talking about?

204
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:39,273
Frank cooks and cleans for you.

205
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:40,775
You're free
to do whatever you want.

206
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:43,343
- Did you get everything?
- Yeah, I got everything.

207
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:45,212
Yeah, you certainly do.

208
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:48,215
So does your mom sing songs
for you before you go to bed?

209
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:49,884
Dude, what is it
with you and singing?

210
00:15:49,918 --> 00:15:51,886
You know what? Yes, yes,
she does sing to me.

211
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,121
She sings to me,
"Why don't you work harder?

212
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:55,924
Ah! My back!"

213
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:58,091
All accompanied to the soothing
mechanical rhythm

214
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,561
of washer-dryers.

215
00:15:59,594 --> 00:16:04,364
"- Ah! My back.
- Ice! My back."

216
00:16:04,398 --> 00:16:07,067
Is that... is that a Korean song?

217
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,368
I think I've heard it before.

218
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:13,373
- Throw the laundry in.
- Kim, is this your car?

219
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:14,441
Yep.

220
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:18,546
- Can I... can I ride in it?
- Yeah.

221
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,616
- Can I ride in the front seat?
- Yep. Let's go.

222
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:22,684
Okay.

223
00:16:24,819 --> 00:16:25,954
Hey, Nicole.

224
00:16:28,823 --> 00:16:29,858
He needs stability.

225
00:16:31,593 --> 00:16:34,729
He has mental illness
and developmental disabilities.

226
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:38,600
Yeah, and I think
he's got grand delusions

227
00:16:38,633 --> 00:16:40,467
and hallucinations
in there as well.

228
00:16:42,537 --> 00:16:45,272
- I mean, don't we all?
- Yeah.

229
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:48,141
I'm gonna double check
his file and I'll be back.

230
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:49,376
Have a blessed day, Frank.

231
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:55,449
So this is
our "laundry mat." Um...

232
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:57,986
Oh, I have to let you know
that my dad's

233
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:00,522
something
a little old-fashioned, so...

234
00:17:00,555 --> 00:17:02,189
Is he like a dinosaur?

235
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:04,424
Kind of, yeah,
pretty much in a sense.

236
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:07,194
You'll get it when you meet him,
really kind of...

237
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:08,262
Marcus?

238
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:10,497
Marcus, hey.

239
00:17:18,806 --> 00:17:20,675
Marcus, hey, focus.

240
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:23,545
- Come on, let's go. Come on, this way.
- Wha... okay!

241
00:17:23,578 --> 00:17:25,547
- You want a job, right?
- Yeah, I want a job.

242
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,281
Okay, then you need
to follow me. Come on.

243
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:28,683
- Okay.
- Back here. The office is over here.

244
00:17:28,716 --> 00:17:29,851
I'll introduce you to my dad.

245
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:40,093
Yo, Dad,
um, I found you some help.

246
00:17:44,431 --> 00:17:45,567
Are you serious?

247
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:50,572
- Marcus, hey, give me the...
- Hey, I'm Marcus. I'm your new worker.

248
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:53,975
Kim, what are you doing?

249
00:17:54,008 --> 00:17:56,343
Hey, you're always telling me
that you need extra help

250
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:59,379
and he could clean
the dumpster area.

251
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:01,381
If he does a really good job,
I mean, eventually,

252
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:03,952
he could maybe take over for me.

253
00:18:07,055 --> 00:18:10,390
- Can you clean dumpsters?
- Yes, I can clean dumpsters.

254
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:12,860
He can clean dumpsters,
there you go.

255
00:18:12,894 --> 00:18:14,596
All right,
I'll leave you two at it.

256
00:18:14,629 --> 00:18:17,364
- Kim! Kim.
- Marcus you be good. I'll see you at home, okay? Bye!

257
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:18,432
Bye, Kim.

258
00:18:25,238 --> 00:18:26,741
- Don't touch that.
- Okay.

259
00:18:27,775 --> 00:18:29,077
- Follow me, please.
- Okay.

260
00:18:32,814 --> 00:18:34,082
All the garbage?

261
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:39,252
It's all the garbage.

262
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,245
Is it Bambi?

263
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:41,348
Candy?

264
00:19:42,717 --> 00:19:45,820
Daisy? Is it Paris?

265
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:49,957
No, those are the names on
the <i>Apocalyptic Zombies</i> show.

266
00:19:49,991 --> 00:19:52,492
I must know my mama's name.

267
00:19:57,565 --> 00:20:00,333
I... I must know their names.

268
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:08,341
Wow! You did
a great job, Marcus.

269
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,111
Thank you.

270
00:20:10,144 --> 00:20:11,344
I've got something for you.

271
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:15,550
Hold on a second.

272
00:20:20,755 --> 00:20:23,457
Okay. All finished.

273
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:24,992
Wow, what is this?

274
00:20:25,026 --> 00:20:26,828
This is your knapsack.
You can sit here

275
00:20:26,861 --> 00:20:31,599
and hang out
and read zombie comics, all day.

276
00:20:33,701 --> 00:20:35,503
This is my favorite one.

277
00:20:35,536 --> 00:20:37,872
Marcus, why are you
in a group home?

278
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:43,410
- 'Cause I ain't got nobody.
- That's bad English.

279
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:46,681
"I have no one"
or "I don't have anyone."

280
00:20:46,714 --> 00:20:47,749
Say it.

281
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,151
I don't have anyone.

282
00:20:51,219 --> 00:20:52,252
Better.

283
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:56,256
- Can you count money?
- Yes.

284
00:20:58,526 --> 00:20:59,560
I mean, no.

285
00:21:00,595 --> 00:21:02,730
It's too bad.
I might have had a job for you.

286
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,934
I... I... I can learn!

287
00:21:06,968 --> 00:21:10,905
I can, I can learn how to count.
I can learn how to count.

288
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:12,774
Come back when you're ready.

289
00:21:12,807 --> 00:21:14,976
Okay, I'm ready. Oh!

290
00:21:20,615 --> 00:21:21,749
Now I'm ready.

291
00:21:25,586 --> 00:21:27,722
No, you can't just drop
this information on him.

292
00:21:27,755 --> 00:21:30,625
We are not dropping information
on him, we are doing our jobs.

293
00:21:30,658 --> 00:21:33,060
- But you have to prep him first.
- Prep him or deprive him?

294
00:21:33,094 --> 00:21:34,896
'Cause that's exactly
what you're doing.

295
00:21:34,929 --> 00:21:36,831
- No, I want him to know too.
- Then tell him.

296
00:21:40,935 --> 00:21:43,037
Hi. Hey, Nicole.

297
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,806
Hi, Marcus.

298
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:47,307
Uh, you, you look...
You look pretty, like a flower.

299
00:21:50,443 --> 00:21:52,445
Marcus, your mother
is in Lompoc Prison.

300
00:21:58,786 --> 00:22:02,657
Oh, I know where my mom is!
I know where my mom is!

301
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:06,828
I know where my mom is!
I know where my mom is!

302
00:22:06,861 --> 00:22:07,929
Thanks.

303
00:22:13,501 --> 00:22:16,804
No, no, you need
toothpaste, weirdo.

304
00:22:18,471 --> 00:22:19,507
There you go.

305
00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:24,579
All right.
Not too hard, not too hard.

306
00:22:24,612 --> 00:22:26,981
Little circles, little circles.

307
00:22:27,949 --> 00:22:29,449
There you go.

308
00:22:29,482 --> 00:22:31,819
If you brush too hard,
you'll hurt yourself

309
00:22:31,853 --> 00:22:33,254
and you end up having to be

310
00:22:33,287 --> 00:22:35,455
on pills the rest
your life, like these.

311
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:37,792
Good morning, Miss Smith.

312
00:22:37,825 --> 00:22:40,328
Marcus, where did you
get these drugs from?

313
00:22:42,563 --> 00:22:44,165
I found them on the floor.

314
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:48,202
Don't lie to me, Marcus.
People don't leave bad drugs

315
00:22:48,236 --> 00:22:50,605
like these
lying around on the floor.

316
00:22:50,638 --> 00:22:53,274
I'm not lying.
I found them on the floor.

317
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,745
That's it. You're suspended.

318
00:23:03,584 --> 00:23:05,052
Frank's waiting for you outside.

319
00:23:33,781 --> 00:23:34,982
Hey, where's Kim at?

320
00:23:37,618 --> 00:23:38,886
He's not here.

321
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,554
I said where's Kim at, yo?

322
00:23:40,588 --> 00:23:41,756
Kim's not here.

323
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:45,626
Please leave.
This is for customers only.

324
00:23:47,128 --> 00:23:49,496
What you gonna do
about it, dawg? Huh?

325
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:51,766
I said please leave.

326
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:53,567
Those security cameras
ain't shit.

327
00:23:54,936 --> 00:23:56,671
No red light.

328
00:23:56,704 --> 00:24:01,709
Hey, I know you. Come here.
You got me kicked out of school.

329
00:24:01,742 --> 00:24:03,277
Come here. I'ma kick his butt.

330
00:24:03,311 --> 00:24:05,846
- Yeah, let me out.
- I'm telling Luis, man.

331
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,316
Yeah, you go tell Luis,
dorsal fin.

332
00:24:14,188 --> 00:24:16,624
You want to go to jail? You
can't go around hurting people.

333
00:24:16,657 --> 00:24:18,225
But he was going
to kick your butt.

334
00:24:18,259 --> 00:24:20,594
I know, but sometimes
you gotta forgive people,

335
00:24:20,628 --> 00:24:23,297
- even if they wanna hurt you.
- Everybody?

336
00:24:23,331 --> 00:24:25,866
Yeah, sometimes
even your family.

337
00:24:27,168 --> 00:24:29,036
But I ain't got no family.

338
00:24:33,274 --> 00:24:34,942
You want to join us
for dinner tonight?

339
00:24:36,444 --> 00:24:38,478
Yes, sure, yeah.

340
00:24:38,512 --> 00:24:39,547
All right.

341
00:24:43,818 --> 00:24:46,620
- Welcome to my house.
- This is your house?

342
00:24:46,654 --> 00:24:47,655
- Yeah.
- What?

343
00:24:49,757 --> 00:24:50,858
Smells delicious!

344
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,096
- Thanks.
- I brought a guest.

345
00:24:55,129 --> 00:24:56,163
Hi.

346
00:24:57,765 --> 00:25:00,668
Marcus? What are you doing here.

347
00:25:00,701 --> 00:25:02,169
I made a lot of money today.

348
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,605
You did. You worked hard.

349
00:25:04,638 --> 00:25:06,474
Yeah, I worked my butt off.

350
00:25:06,507 --> 00:25:07,541
Yeah.

351
00:25:08,542 --> 00:25:12,480
I worked so many hours.

352
00:25:12,513 --> 00:25:14,915
I love that comic book place,

353
00:25:14,949 --> 00:25:16,917
that bed thing that you made.

354
00:25:16,951 --> 00:25:18,319
Yeah, it was hard work.

355
00:25:18,352 --> 00:25:19,620
You worked hard.

356
00:25:19,653 --> 00:25:22,523
Yeah, I had to use
all my muscles.

357
00:25:22,556 --> 00:25:26,627
You did. He was a great help.
I was really impressed.

358
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:29,363
It's all for you, best friend.

359
00:25:29,397 --> 00:25:31,699
- Thank you.
- Yeah!

360
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,605
I made so much money today.

361
00:25:41,342 --> 00:25:43,010
Jung, who's this?

362
00:25:43,377 --> 00:25:44,412
This is Marcus.

363
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,688
He saved me
from the gang bangers.

364
00:25:55,756 --> 00:25:57,925
Yeah, I'm the hero
this town deserves.

365
00:26:07,368 --> 00:26:09,504
Dad, why didn't you
just hide in the office?

366
00:26:09,538 --> 00:26:11,506
Why didn't you fix
the security cameras

367
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,640
like you promised?

368
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:17,344
Welcome
to the reality television show,

369
00:26:17,378 --> 00:26:19,680
<i>The Koreans
of South Central L.A.,</i>

370
00:26:19,713 --> 00:26:21,816
starring my family, the Parks.

371
00:26:25,252 --> 00:26:27,988
Marcus, what are you
grateful for?

372
00:26:28,022 --> 00:26:30,458
I don't have anything
to be grateful for.

373
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,660
You sound like my son.

374
00:26:34,762 --> 00:26:36,964
Oh, I know
what to be grateful for.

375
00:26:37,965 --> 00:26:40,134
I'm grateful for my mama.

376
00:26:42,236 --> 00:26:44,506
She's at Lompoc Security Prison.

377
00:26:46,575 --> 00:26:51,078
I want to have the most apocalyptic
Thanksgiving lunch with her.

378
00:26:55,116 --> 00:26:57,418
But Frank
won't drive me down there.

379
00:26:57,451 --> 00:26:58,953
- Who's Frank?
- Um...

380
00:26:58,986 --> 00:27:01,021
You know you don't need
Frank to take you, right?

381
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:05,826
It's only $167
round trip to the prison.

382
00:27:07,928 --> 00:27:10,532
Apparently too much
for my parents to afford to come

383
00:27:10,565 --> 00:27:11,899
and visit me, but, hey,

384
00:27:11,932 --> 00:27:13,367
you can have
dinner with your mom.

385
00:27:16,571 --> 00:27:17,671
Kim!

386
00:27:19,273 --> 00:27:20,509
Is this enough?

387
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:41,462
- Oh! Oh.
- Marcus. Marcus.

388
00:27:41,495 --> 00:27:44,031
- Yeah?
- I made a chart for you.

389
00:27:46,267 --> 00:27:48,903
Five of these pennies
make a nickel.

390
00:27:48,936 --> 00:27:50,337
Yeah.

391
00:27:50,371 --> 00:27:52,439
- Two nickels make...
- That's a dime.

392
00:27:52,473 --> 00:27:53,908
That's a dime, right.

393
00:27:53,941 --> 00:27:57,077
Two dimes
and a nickel make a quarter.

394
00:27:57,111 --> 00:27:59,680
- You know what a quarter is?
- Yes, I know what a quarter is.

395
00:27:59,713 --> 00:28:03,150
Right, so, four quarters
make a dollar.

396
00:28:03,184 --> 00:28:05,786
And everything in the laundromat
costs a dollar.

397
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:07,154
So take this chart

398
00:28:08,623 --> 00:28:10,525
- and practice.
- Okay, yeah.

399
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,693
And then you'll know
how to count money.

400
00:28:41,188 --> 00:28:43,724
A dollar for every time
someone says thank you.

401
00:28:43,757 --> 00:28:45,893
I call it
my mustard seed money tree.

402
00:28:45,926 --> 00:28:47,562
This is our secret,
okay, Marcus?

403
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:03,444
Oh! My show's on.

404
00:29:04,745 --> 00:29:07,549
- I guess you could watch it on my computer.
- Okay.

405
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,451
Just sit down right here.

406
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:21,195
- All right, have a good show.
- Wait. Don't go.

407
00:29:21,228 --> 00:29:22,263
Watch it with me.

408
00:29:30,237 --> 00:29:31,272
Hello?

409
00:29:40,247 --> 00:29:41,650
Oh! Yes!

410
00:29:45,152 --> 00:29:46,787
It's charging.

411
00:29:55,996 --> 00:29:57,798
Frank lets you watch this?

412
00:29:57,831 --> 00:30:01,969
Oh, they're just zombies,
and it helps me sleep at night.

413
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:09,476
<i>Hello? Anybody here?</i>

414
00:30:30,164 --> 00:30:32,366
I am a strong woman.

415
00:30:34,101 --> 00:30:36,303
I am a strong woman.

416
00:30:37,338 --> 00:30:39,907
I am a strong woman!

417
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,609
- I...
- Quiet!

418
00:30:41,643 --> 00:30:43,110
<i>- What?
- They can hear you.</i>

419
00:30:43,143 --> 00:30:44,579
<i>Who?</i>

420
00:30:44,612 --> 00:30:48,750
Oh, that's nice.
Found a good friend.

421
00:30:48,783 --> 00:30:51,418
<i>First rule
of the zombie apocalypse is,</i>

422
00:30:51,452 --> 00:30:54,054
<i>don't let the enemy
know your whereabouts.</i>

423
00:30:54,088 --> 00:30:57,525
What's with the bandana?
You look like a mini Rambo.

424
00:30:57,559 --> 00:30:59,694
You don't want to get caught
doing a picture-perfect ninja move

425
00:30:59,728 --> 00:31:02,697
and then blood gets in
your eyes. You get infected.

426
00:31:02,731 --> 00:31:05,199
Come on, this is
a zombie apocalypse.

427
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:09,169
All my mom would do
is non-stop chatter

428
00:31:09,203 --> 00:31:11,939
about the apocalypse as if it's the
most important thing in the world.

429
00:31:19,346 --> 00:31:21,148
You just told me to be quiet.

430
00:31:21,181 --> 00:31:23,250
Shh!
I'm signaling for my father.

431
00:31:24,885 --> 00:31:26,920
- Who told you?
- What?

432
00:31:36,564 --> 00:31:39,567
The bomb shelter. It was our
idea to raid the bomb shelter

433
00:31:39,601 --> 00:31:43,036
while everybody was stuffing
their face for Thanksgiving dinner.

434
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,639
Thanksgiving lunch,

435
00:31:44,672 --> 00:31:46,608
and I'm supposed to meet
my girlfriends here.

436
00:31:47,941 --> 00:31:49,109
God, where are they?

437
00:31:52,747 --> 00:31:56,718
I don't know who this bozo is,
but I hope he can kill zombies.

438
00:31:56,751 --> 00:32:00,254
Family that slays together
stays together.

439
00:32:06,393 --> 00:32:08,228
You okay?

440
00:32:08,262 --> 00:32:09,296
I'm okay.

441
00:32:13,467 --> 00:32:14,935
Good morning.

442
00:32:15,904 --> 00:32:17,237
How you doing today, son?

443
00:32:17,271 --> 00:32:19,239
Great, great.
Yeah, been drug free

444
00:32:19,273 --> 00:32:22,443
for like five whole minutes,
staying strong.

445
00:32:27,481 --> 00:32:29,216
You paid Marcus.

446
00:32:29,249 --> 00:32:31,218
Did you raise the prices?

447
00:32:31,251 --> 00:32:32,352
I had to pay him.

448
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:36,858
If I can teach him how to count,
maybe we can hire him full-time.

449
00:32:36,891 --> 00:32:39,794
Besides, I'm good at teaching
people who have problems learning.

450
00:32:41,796 --> 00:32:44,131
Oh, you mean me.

451
00:32:44,164 --> 00:32:47,267
Really, you're going to compare
me to a guy who has special needs?

452
00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:50,237
I cooked you breakfast
and studied for my calculus exam

453
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:52,439
at the same time.
Can he do that?

454
00:32:54,074 --> 00:32:57,377
Hmm? No, no, I didn't think so.

455
00:32:57,411 --> 00:33:01,048
Kim, one, parents, zero.
What up?

456
00:33:02,115 --> 00:33:03,383
I think you're on drugs now.

457
00:33:05,152 --> 00:33:07,387
Only uppers.

458
00:33:07,421 --> 00:33:08,989
It's too early
for downers right now.

459
00:33:09,022 --> 00:33:10,057
Enough!

460
00:33:33,882 --> 00:33:35,048
Geez, Kimmy!

461
00:33:58,573 --> 00:34:01,876
Mom, are you okay? Damn.

462
00:34:03,043 --> 00:34:05,279
What did I tell you
about eating so much junk food?

463
00:34:05,312 --> 00:34:07,381
Now you're just too big
to make it upstairs.

464
00:34:09,249 --> 00:34:11,686
No mother deserves
to be spoken to like that.

465
00:34:15,422 --> 00:34:17,224
Marcus, help me upstairs.

466
00:34:17,257 --> 00:34:19,126
No, no, here, I was kidding.
I'll help you.

467
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:22,496
No! Turn around, Marcus.

468
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:23,565
Okay.

469
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:37,979
You okay? You ready? Okay.

470
00:34:39,379 --> 00:34:42,082
- Oh.
- There we go. Let's go.

471
00:34:43,851 --> 00:34:45,218
One at a time.

472
00:34:50,123 --> 00:34:52,426
- Don't drop me.
- Okay.

473
00:35:00,434 --> 00:35:02,804
Okay. You all right?

474
00:35:05,138 --> 00:35:06,574
Yeah.

475
00:35:06,608 --> 00:35:08,743
Okay.

476
00:35:08,776 --> 00:35:10,177
You're gonna be okay?

477
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:12,446
- Yeah, yeah.
- All right.

478
00:35:34,167 --> 00:35:36,269
Oh, man. What the hell
are you doing in my room?

479
00:35:36,303 --> 00:35:37,839
What happened to you?

480
00:35:39,339 --> 00:35:40,374
Do you mind?

481
00:35:43,011 --> 00:35:44,045
Okay.

482
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:55,890
Look, um, when I was in prison,

483
00:35:58,026 --> 00:36:01,796
I saw my mom.
She was nagging the whole time.

484
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:03,330
Nag, nag...

485
00:36:04,866 --> 00:36:09,103
Yeah, yeah, in prison.
I thought I was going crazy.

486
00:36:09,137 --> 00:36:10,738
I couldn't tell anybody

487
00:36:10,772 --> 00:36:14,642
and they would have put me
in some straight jacket

488
00:36:14,676 --> 00:36:15,877
and throw me in an asylum.

489
00:36:19,346 --> 00:36:23,584
It wasn't actually until rehab
that I realized how much pain

490
00:36:23,618 --> 00:36:29,157
I had caused my family.
And then, poof.

491
00:36:30,525 --> 00:36:31,859
Just like that she was gone.

492
00:36:33,861 --> 00:36:36,496
Look, this stays between you
and me, all right?

493
00:36:37,397 --> 00:36:39,000
Okay.

494
00:36:39,033 --> 00:36:41,435
Don't hug me.

495
00:36:45,139 --> 00:36:47,542
- Now get the hell out of my room.
- Oh, okay.

496
00:37:00,154 --> 00:37:02,657
Girl, you got a major hickey!

497
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:04,391
Are you kidding? They're
really zombies. I'm serious.

498
00:37:04,424 --> 00:37:06,894
- Whoo, they smell really bad.
- Let me explain something to you.

499
00:37:06,928 --> 00:37:08,796
- They're zombies. Zombies bad.
- Oh!

500
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:09,997
- Go!
- Oh, oh!

501
00:37:16,236 --> 00:37:19,874
And then he was getting lava
poured all over him

502
00:37:19,907 --> 00:37:23,845
and he was burning,
but then, the... the baker zombie

503
00:37:23,878 --> 00:37:27,715
came out and he said,
"Get that boy out of there."

504
00:37:27,749 --> 00:37:30,551
And then he grabbed him
and took him out of the lava

505
00:37:30,585 --> 00:37:32,754
and then snapped his neck.

506
00:37:32,787 --> 00:37:35,957
And then... and then season six
ended in a cliffhanger,

507
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:37,759
so I don't know
what happens next.

508
00:37:37,792 --> 00:37:40,061
What is your obsession
with zombies?

509
00:37:40,094 --> 00:37:41,896
They are disgusting

510
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:44,264
and that is why you have
violent behavioral episodes.

511
00:37:58,045 --> 00:37:59,847
Thanks, Nicole.

512
00:38:04,886 --> 00:38:07,522
- He's gonna go nuts.
- Then sell the business.

513
00:38:07,555 --> 00:38:10,191
I can't sell the group home.
I grew up with some of them.

514
00:38:10,224 --> 00:38:12,093
- They're like my family.
- We're here to serve

515
00:38:12,126 --> 00:38:14,294
the clients,
not institutionalize them.

516
00:38:14,327 --> 00:38:16,964
What kind of a relationship
do you think he can have?

517
00:38:16,998 --> 00:38:18,498
You just want the money,
don't you?

518
00:38:20,268 --> 00:38:23,104
Frank! Nicole! I need help.

519
00:38:23,137 --> 00:38:26,541
I need to decide which zombie
my mom would want to see.

520
00:38:26,574 --> 00:38:28,776
Should I show her this one or...

521
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:31,646
Or should I show
zombie Steve Jobs?

522
00:38:34,282 --> 00:38:35,783
You're a mama, you should know.

523
00:38:38,953 --> 00:38:40,320
I'll see you tomorrow, Marcus.

524
00:38:41,989 --> 00:38:43,024
Nicole?

525
00:38:44,826 --> 00:38:47,762
N-Nicole! You didn't give me
an answer.

526
00:38:47,795 --> 00:38:50,832
I will see you tomorrow, Marcus.
- I just wanted...

527
00:38:55,368 --> 00:38:58,371
- I like that one.
- I like it too.

528
00:38:59,674 --> 00:39:00,708
Thanks, Frank.

529
00:39:08,816 --> 00:39:09,851
I gotta go.

530
00:39:11,319 --> 00:39:12,352
Bye.

531
00:39:20,661 --> 00:39:22,897
Can you work another night
to give your father a break?

532
00:39:24,565 --> 00:39:26,968
Why can't you do it? You're
feeling better, aren't you?

533
00:39:27,001 --> 00:39:28,502
My back!

534
00:39:28,536 --> 00:39:30,204
Okay, fine,
if your back hurts so much,

535
00:39:30,238 --> 00:39:31,873
why don't you go see
an acupuncturist or something?

536
00:39:31,906 --> 00:39:34,441
I mean, it's like
you're pretending

537
00:39:34,474 --> 00:39:36,878
your back hurts even more
to make me feel guilty.

538
00:39:36,911 --> 00:39:38,813
Okay, then take me now.

539
00:39:38,846 --> 00:39:40,480
No, I can't just take you n...

540
00:39:40,514 --> 00:39:42,449
You can't just spring
something like this on me

541
00:39:42,482 --> 00:39:43,951
out of nowhere.

542
00:39:43,985 --> 00:39:46,621
- I have plans.
- Hey, I can take you.

543
00:39:46,654 --> 00:39:48,222
And don't you have
to be somewhere?

544
00:39:48,256 --> 00:39:51,626
Yeah, I got a hot set
of wheels out front.

545
00:39:51,659 --> 00:39:54,394
- Hot set of wheels?
- Yeah. Hot set of wheels.

546
00:39:54,427 --> 00:39:59,967
Yeah, it's nice, it's comfy,
it seats two people,

547
00:40:00,001 --> 00:40:02,236
if you count the driver,

548
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:04,471
and it's really easy
to get around.

549
00:40:05,506 --> 00:40:10,011
- What's an, uh, an acu...
- An acupuncturist.

550
00:40:10,044 --> 00:40:12,847
- Yeah, what's an acupuncturist?
- A doctor for my back.

551
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,982
I overworked myself for Kim.

552
00:40:15,016 --> 00:40:17,952
Well, Kim works so hard,
he doesn't even have time

553
00:40:17,985 --> 00:40:20,988
to watch
<i>Apocalyptic Zombies</i> with me.

554
00:40:21,022 --> 00:40:22,924
He abandoned
his responsibilities

555
00:40:22,957 --> 00:40:25,726
while he was in prison
and left us alone.

556
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,429
- Why do you yell at him so much?
- Because I care.

557
00:40:29,462 --> 00:40:31,599
Like, Kim's so nice.

558
00:40:31,632 --> 00:40:34,735
Just take me
to the acupuncturist, okay?

559
00:40:40,908 --> 00:40:42,276
So, tell me about the hospital.

560
00:40:44,612 --> 00:40:47,281
Pretty nice or bad?

561
00:40:49,817 --> 00:40:52,219
- It was bad.
- It was bad.

562
00:40:52,253 --> 00:40:54,422
So at the hospital
people were given drugs, right?

563
00:40:56,324 --> 00:40:57,892
Yeah.

564
00:40:57,925 --> 00:40:59,860
What if the people
didn't want to take drugs?

565
00:41:03,264 --> 00:41:09,537
They strap you down
and force them down your throat.

566
00:41:11,973 --> 00:41:13,641
Morning, noon, and night.

567
00:41:16,944 --> 00:41:20,848
One time, these twins
were given a lobotomy.

568
00:41:22,016 --> 00:41:25,086
I could hear them
screaming all night long.

569
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:28,956
There was pus oozing
from the stitches

570
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:31,892
on their ears and their eyes.

571
00:41:34,428 --> 00:41:37,064
They were wearing hockey masks.

572
00:41:37,098 --> 00:41:39,667
Wait, what hospital
are you talking about?

573
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:42,103
Are you talking
about the hospital you were in?

574
00:41:42,136 --> 00:41:44,438
Oh, no, that was...
That was the hospital

575
00:41:44,472 --> 00:41:47,908
on <i>Apocalyptic Zombies.</i>

576
00:41:47,942 --> 00:41:52,346
No, the hospital
I was at was nice. I liked it.

577
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,415
I never wanted to leave.

578
00:41:57,118 --> 00:41:58,786
Do you even own a shotgun?

579
00:41:58,819 --> 00:42:00,154
Too easy.

580
00:42:00,187 --> 00:42:02,089
There's so many ways
you can kill them.

581
00:42:02,123 --> 00:42:03,591
You could trip them

582
00:42:03,624 --> 00:42:06,027
and, uh, smash their heads
into the floor.

583
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,796
You could, uh, behead them
with a ninja sword.

584
00:42:08,829 --> 00:42:10,598
You could take their limbs
and shove them

585
00:42:10,631 --> 00:42:12,867
into a trash compactor.
And then, and then,

586
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,969
you have the mother
of all weapons,

587
00:42:15,002 --> 00:42:17,605
which is the chainsaw.
It's good for close range,

588
00:42:17,638 --> 00:42:20,941
and you can...

589
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:31,052
All right, let's see
what we have here.

590
00:42:32,186 --> 00:42:36,457
Not bad. How many ways
can you behead a zombie?

591
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:38,559
You can behead them.

592
00:42:38,592 --> 00:42:40,461
- That's one.
- You can strangle them.

593
00:42:40,494 --> 00:42:43,831
- Strangle them.
- I love zombies.

594
00:42:43,864 --> 00:42:46,801
Me too! I love...

595
00:42:48,702 --> 00:42:52,473
How do you kill zombies?
Oh, you electrocute them!

596
00:42:52,507 --> 00:42:54,742
You can starve them to death,

597
00:42:54,775 --> 00:42:57,078
but they don't really die
of starvation.

598
00:42:57,111 --> 00:43:00,581
- Their flesh just rots off.
- Well, how many is that?

599
00:43:01,182 --> 00:43:03,818
Oh, you put them
in the microwave.

600
00:43:03,851 --> 00:43:06,555
You can take a broom
and you can take the...

601
00:43:06,587 --> 00:43:08,923
...handle and...

602
00:43:08,956 --> 00:43:10,525
- Ah!
- Choke them.

603
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:12,561
- Choke them.
- Bang their head in.

604
00:43:12,593 --> 00:43:14,328
- Bang their heads.
- You can mess up

605
00:43:14,361 --> 00:43:16,263
- their credit rating.
- That's fine, keep going.

606
00:43:16,297 --> 00:43:17,865
That was a good broom!

607
00:43:17,898 --> 00:43:20,668
Oh, you throw them in the water.

608
00:43:20,701 --> 00:43:23,871
Sometimes it's not the zombies
you need to look out for.

609
00:43:23,904 --> 00:43:25,673
He's not fun.

610
00:43:25,706 --> 00:43:28,409
No, you can't forget
the chainsaw.

611
00:43:30,945 --> 00:43:33,582
If there's an apocalypse,
you wouldn't have electricity.

612
00:43:33,614 --> 00:43:35,517
Gasoline.

613
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:36,917
That makes 22.

614
00:43:39,753 --> 00:43:42,056
You're getting it. You got it.

615
00:43:42,089 --> 00:43:44,625
I got it! Yeah!

616
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:58,507
- Oh, let me help you.
- No, no, no, let me finish.

617
00:44:00,074 --> 00:44:01,108
Mom?

618
00:44:02,476 --> 00:44:05,146
Me Young, you're doing it!

619
00:44:05,179 --> 00:44:06,847
She's doing it, Kim!

620
00:44:12,653 --> 00:44:13,687
Okay.

621
00:44:22,631 --> 00:44:25,733
- Sorry.
- Careful, I'm still sore.

622
00:44:25,766 --> 00:44:28,269
- I'm sorry.
- How did this happen?

623
00:44:28,302 --> 00:44:31,172
Marcus took me
to the acupuncturist.

624
00:44:31,205 --> 00:44:33,741
- Good job, Marcus.
- You're welcome.

625
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:39,747
Hey, hey, um, uh, uh...

626
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:43,652
I'm sorry about what happened
in the laundromat earlier.

627
00:44:43,684 --> 00:44:46,420
Jung said I can't go
around hurting people

628
00:44:46,453 --> 00:44:48,422
and I hope I didn't hurt you.

629
00:44:49,524 --> 00:44:54,862
You didn't hurt nobody, man.
I am Paco. I roll with Luis, yo.

630
00:44:54,895 --> 00:44:56,897
Okay, so we're cool?

631
00:44:57,798 --> 00:44:59,333
Yeah, we good, dawg.

632
00:44:59,366 --> 00:45:01,368
Whoa! What's that?

633
00:45:01,402 --> 00:45:03,437
My homeboy Luis.

634
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:06,440
Oh, that's cool.

635
00:45:08,075 --> 00:45:09,977
Oh!

636
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:11,680
So what are you doing here, yo?

637
00:45:13,013 --> 00:45:14,583
I'm trying to earn some money.

638
00:45:15,983 --> 00:45:17,451
Wanna make some real money?

639
00:45:19,588 --> 00:45:21,255
Right, follow me.

640
00:45:33,535 --> 00:45:34,569
Oh!

641
00:45:35,769 --> 00:45:37,171
Why didn't you kill them?

642
00:45:37,204 --> 00:45:39,039
I saved you. You can go now.

643
00:45:39,073 --> 00:45:41,742
Wait, wait, where are you going?

644
00:45:43,244 --> 00:45:44,378
Why are you following me?

645
00:45:45,779 --> 00:45:48,382
My mom was burned alive,
I can't find my friends,

646
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:49,783
and my phone is dead.

647
00:45:52,052 --> 00:45:54,623
You may be a fashion risk,
but you're all I've got.

648
00:45:56,457 --> 00:45:57,958
I'm Andrea, by the way.

649
00:46:02,597 --> 00:46:04,666
What?

650
00:46:07,569 --> 00:46:10,404
Uh, you should kill them.

651
00:46:10,437 --> 00:46:11,772
- Kill them?
- Uh-huh.

652
00:46:11,805 --> 00:46:12,840
Kill them.

653
00:46:20,715 --> 00:46:23,183
When I stuck my hand
up her shirt,

654
00:46:23,217 --> 00:46:24,418
I pulled her guts out...

655
00:46:27,656 --> 00:46:28,690
This shop right here.

656
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:32,092
- Tattoo.
- Oh, Paco.

657
00:46:33,093 --> 00:46:34,663
- What's up, dawg?
- What's up, yo?

658
00:46:36,397 --> 00:46:38,032
It's good, man.

659
00:46:38,065 --> 00:46:40,301
- Who's this?
- -Hey, it's cool, it's cool.

660
00:46:41,802 --> 00:46:44,606
Hey, you're the guy
on Paco's tattoo.

661
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:49,143
That's right. See these tats?

662
00:46:49,176 --> 00:46:51,812
They represent
blood brothers for life

663
00:46:51,845 --> 00:46:54,048
and who's got your back
when everything goes down.

664
00:46:55,349 --> 00:46:57,017
Do you guys sell drugs?

665
00:47:01,255 --> 00:47:03,290
Do we sell drugs? This guy.

666
00:47:04,592 --> 00:47:08,062
He goes to that special school.

667
00:47:08,095 --> 00:47:12,600
Oh! We don't sell drugs.

668
00:47:14,669 --> 00:47:16,337
Drugs bad.

669
00:47:18,372 --> 00:47:21,108
Yo, he's retarded, not deaf.

670
00:47:21,141 --> 00:47:24,845
No, no, you have
mental retardation,

671
00:47:24,878 --> 00:47:28,650
you aren't retarded.
There's a difference.

672
00:47:28,683 --> 00:47:30,585
See, Alfredo,
Alfredo is retarded.

673
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:34,922
Yo, he could be our muscle, man.

674
00:47:37,458 --> 00:47:40,628
They ain't gonna put special
people like him in prison.

675
00:47:40,662 --> 00:47:44,666
I took the test and I passed
'cause I'm too smart.

676
00:47:46,066 --> 00:47:48,469
You were supposed
to fail, stupid.

677
00:47:48,503 --> 00:47:49,771
So you don't go to juvie.

678
00:47:51,506 --> 00:47:52,607
Huh.

679
00:47:54,375 --> 00:47:56,276
Wanna make some easy coin?

680
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:58,112
I just want to earn
enough to see my mama.

681
00:47:59,514 --> 00:48:01,448
See your mama?

682
00:48:01,482 --> 00:48:02,684
Yeah.

683
00:48:02,717 --> 00:48:04,418
Hmm. Tell you what,

684
00:48:05,653 --> 00:48:07,187
why don't you join our family?

685
00:48:08,255 --> 00:48:09,791
You can make
all the money you want,

686
00:48:09,824 --> 00:48:11,358
see your mama all the time.

687
00:48:13,026 --> 00:48:14,061
What do you say?

688
00:48:24,706 --> 00:48:29,811
Go ahead, Marcus.
Welcome to the crib.

689
00:48:29,844 --> 00:48:32,179
Yeah.

690
00:48:32,212 --> 00:48:34,516
- Hi, Luis.
- -Come on down, man, have a seat.

691
00:48:34,549 --> 00:48:36,917
- Okay.
- What's up, Paco?

692
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:39,987
All right?
How are you doing, Marcus?

693
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:42,857
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
sit down, sit down.

694
00:48:42,891 --> 00:48:45,560
- Okay.
- Let's get comfortable.

695
00:48:45,593 --> 00:48:46,927
<i>Mi casa es su casa.</i>

696
00:48:49,396 --> 00:48:50,931
Check this out.

697
00:48:50,964 --> 00:48:53,100
- Like what you see, Marcus?
- Do you work out?

698
00:48:53,133 --> 00:48:56,069
There she is.
She does more than work out.

699
00:48:57,705 --> 00:48:59,406
- Hey, baby.
- She's pretty.

700
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,208
Yes, she's pretty.

701
00:49:01,241 --> 00:49:03,310
Why don't you turn around for
him, baby, show him what you got?

702
00:49:04,411 --> 00:49:05,914
See that.

703
00:49:05,946 --> 00:49:07,515
She's a ballerina!

704
00:49:07,549 --> 00:49:09,416
Yeah, she's a ballerina!

705
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:11,653
- Yeah, I'm a ballerina.
- Sit down, baby!

706
00:49:14,254 --> 00:49:18,125
Baby, I want you to get
to know Marcus over here.

707
00:49:27,167 --> 00:49:31,138
Hi, I'm Marcus.
I'm 23 years old.

708
00:49:31,171 --> 00:49:35,476
I'm sure nobody messes with you,
tells you what to do, right?

709
00:49:36,443 --> 00:49:37,512
Right.

710
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:41,281
Do you know what
<i>"hermano"</i> means?

711
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:45,319
- No.
- It means brother.

712
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,857
You want to be
my brother, Marcus?

713
00:49:50,357 --> 00:49:52,459
You want to protect
little old Sophia

714
00:49:52,493 --> 00:49:53,795
from the bad guys?

715
00:49:55,295 --> 00:49:57,130
Sure, I'll be your brother.

716
00:50:01,603 --> 00:50:03,671
Maybe we can make
a little bit of money.

717
00:50:05,707 --> 00:50:07,007
You want to make some money?

718
00:50:09,009 --> 00:50:10,845
Okay.

719
00:50:10,879 --> 00:50:13,480
Are you ready to be
part of the family?

720
00:50:13,515 --> 00:50:14,649
Family is everything.

721
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:17,752
That's right.

722
00:50:17,785 --> 00:50:18,820
<i>Mi hermano.</i>

723
00:50:32,032 --> 00:50:33,233
It looks good on you.

724
00:50:37,805 --> 00:50:40,508
You know?
You wanna go for a swim?

725
00:50:41,843 --> 00:50:43,443
I don't have any swim trunks.

726
00:50:43,477 --> 00:50:45,947
It's okay, I'm sure
the boys got something.

727
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:47,849
Right, Luis?

728
00:50:47,882 --> 00:50:48,917
Okay.

729
00:50:54,722 --> 00:50:57,324
Uh, Sophia has a jiggly butt.

730
00:50:57,357 --> 00:50:58,893
Sophia has a jiggly butt.

731
00:51:04,032 --> 00:51:05,867
Come on, come on.

732
00:51:29,023 --> 00:51:31,325
Can you believe this guy?

733
00:51:31,358 --> 00:51:32,994
Yo, check this out, yo.

734
00:51:33,027 --> 00:51:34,929
- Yeah, get him.
- Hey, punk!

735
00:51:37,097 --> 00:51:39,266
- Where's my money at?
- I don't got your money!

736
00:51:41,803 --> 00:51:43,403
You hear this fool?

737
00:51:43,437 --> 00:51:46,674
Your own people are stopping you
from seeing your mama.

738
00:51:46,708 --> 00:51:48,442
They're not your family.

739
00:51:48,475 --> 00:51:49,844
- Get him!
- This chump?

740
00:51:55,083 --> 00:51:56,116
What?

741
00:52:00,722 --> 00:52:02,489
Punk. Yeah.

742
00:52:03,558 --> 00:52:05,359
That's right, boy.

743
00:52:05,392 --> 00:52:07,962
It's all good. You got this,
man, you got this.

744
00:52:09,396 --> 00:52:12,299
So get some new swag, yo.
You got this.

745
00:52:12,332 --> 00:52:14,102
Let's go before the cops come.
Let's go.

746
00:52:47,502 --> 00:52:50,038
The next time you stay out
this late, I'm calling the police.

747
00:52:55,543 --> 00:52:57,945
<i>I've killed lots of zombies
before. Lots of them.</i>

748
00:53:01,783 --> 00:53:03,250
Did you even hear
what I just said?

749
00:53:06,286 --> 00:53:08,656
Go make me
something to eat, dawg.

750
00:53:09,924 --> 00:53:12,794
<i>- When?
- Uh, last summer.</i>

751
00:53:12,827 --> 00:53:13,961
Have you been drinking?

752
00:53:13,995 --> 00:53:15,328
<i>So, you've actually gone</i>

753
00:53:15,362 --> 00:53:17,197
<i>all the way and killed them.</i>

754
00:53:19,232 --> 00:53:23,771
<i>So, uh, why didn't you kill
them if they were zombies?</i>

755
00:53:23,805 --> 00:53:26,541
<i>Because. You know,</i>

756
00:53:26,574 --> 00:53:29,844
<i>I've killed lots of zombies
before. Lots of them.</i>

757
00:53:29,877 --> 00:53:32,312
You just lost
your weekly allowance.

758
00:53:32,345 --> 00:53:33,413
<i>Let's see a photo...</i>

759
00:53:34,649 --> 00:53:37,952
You blew it.
Gang clothes, Frank?

760
00:53:37,985 --> 00:53:41,689
He has the right
to wear whatever he wants.

761
00:53:41,723 --> 00:53:43,191
Somebody else gave it to him.

762
00:53:43,256 --> 00:53:45,225
Oh, Marcus,
Marcus they're really loud.

763
00:53:45,258 --> 00:53:46,861
- Shush!
- And he's moving

764
00:53:46,894 --> 00:53:48,596
- to another facility.
- What?!

765
00:53:49,931 --> 00:53:51,566
- You can't just do that!
- No, Marcus.

766
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:53,300
They're yelling
and they're really mad!

767
00:53:53,333 --> 00:53:55,235
- Shush! Shush!
- I have to go.

768
00:53:55,268 --> 00:53:57,171
I can't afford to lose a client.

769
00:53:57,205 --> 00:53:58,906
He needs more attention

770
00:54:00,575 --> 00:54:03,144
and another psych evaluation.

771
00:54:03,177 --> 00:54:05,847
There's nothing wrong with him.
He wants to be with his mother.

772
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:06,948
Bye, Marcus.

773
00:54:09,282 --> 00:54:11,586
I want to be with my mother,
but she passed away.

774
00:54:11,619 --> 00:54:14,122
There's nothing
psychologically wrong with me.

775
00:54:20,427 --> 00:54:21,729
Shit.

776
00:54:28,368 --> 00:54:29,402
Marcus, meds.

777
00:54:35,243 --> 00:54:38,212
We're a family and we have
to take care of one another.

778
00:54:38,246 --> 00:54:40,715
I have the right
to refuse medication.

779
00:54:40,748 --> 00:54:44,384
And you also have the right
to be homeless

780
00:54:44,417 --> 00:54:45,753
where you have no family.

781
00:55:05,239 --> 00:55:07,108
Hey, show me.

782
00:55:43,443 --> 00:55:46,647
Mama, I want to see you again,
but I don't...

783
00:55:47,615 --> 00:55:49,851
I don't think you'll remember
what I look like.

784
00:55:54,155 --> 00:55:55,756
I've changed a lot, Mommy,

785
00:55:55,790 --> 00:55:58,326
and I hope
you can still remember me,

786
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:02,495
because I... I still love you
like I used to.

787
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:04,832
I'm... I'm trying
to raise enough money

788
00:56:04,866 --> 00:56:06,567
so I can come see you.

789
00:56:07,501 --> 00:56:09,237
But I'll be there.

790
00:56:11,706 --> 00:56:15,009
We can... we can have
Thanksgiving lunch

791
00:56:16,644 --> 00:56:19,714
and watch
<i>Apocalyptic Zombies</i> together.

792
00:56:25,253 --> 00:56:27,121
- Go make us a drink.
- Okay.

793
00:56:27,154 --> 00:56:30,591
Paco!
Marcus, check this out, man.

794
00:56:30,625 --> 00:56:34,295
- You ever seen one of these?
- Yeah, it's a pistol.

795
00:56:34,328 --> 00:56:36,530
I want you
to be protected like a man.

796
00:56:36,564 --> 00:56:39,200
- Whoa, yo, chill, chill, chill!
- He's all right.

797
00:56:46,007 --> 00:56:48,175
Oh, no, no, no,
that can't go in there.

798
00:56:48,209 --> 00:56:51,746
- Why not?
- The colors with colors.

799
00:56:51,779 --> 00:56:53,881
But if you put
the wrong piece of clothing

800
00:56:53,915 --> 00:56:56,651
in the wrong place, it
could ruin the entire laundry.

801
00:56:58,085 --> 00:57:00,955
Well, well, well,
look who's back.

802
00:57:03,591 --> 00:57:04,625
Hey, Luis.

803
00:57:05,726 --> 00:57:07,561
You think you can do me
a favor and hook some up?

804
00:57:08,963 --> 00:57:12,166
Hook some up? You still owe me.

805
00:57:12,199 --> 00:57:14,735
Kim. Kim, we gotta go
to the bus station.

806
00:57:14,769 --> 00:57:16,771
I got enough money
to see my mama.

807
00:57:16,804 --> 00:57:18,906
And where'd you
get the money, Marcus?

808
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:22,176
Oh, I got it from...
From Jung's office.

809
00:57:22,209 --> 00:57:24,178
There's a big safe
with all kinds of money.

810
00:57:24,211 --> 00:57:25,513
- Marcus, shut up.
- Oh, yeah?

811
00:57:25,546 --> 00:57:27,648
- Let me see it.
- Okay.

812
00:57:33,788 --> 00:57:39,193
With all this money,
you can stab them, cut them...

813
00:57:39,226 --> 00:57:40,528
Let me see that.

814
00:57:40,561 --> 00:57:43,397
Hey, that's my money!

815
00:57:43,431 --> 00:57:44,765
Very good.

816
00:57:45,299 --> 00:57:47,702
Uh. Ouch.

817
00:57:47,735 --> 00:57:50,805
You know what?
Your debt's clear with me, Kim.

818
00:57:54,075 --> 00:57:55,109
There you go.

819
00:57:56,510 --> 00:57:57,545
Now get out of here.

820
00:57:59,347 --> 00:58:00,948
- Come on, Marcus.
- No, no, no, no,

821
00:58:00,982 --> 00:58:02,750
I want to talk to Marcus.
You go.

822
00:58:02,783 --> 00:58:04,285
Get out, go.

823
00:58:11,192 --> 00:58:12,827
Damn it.

824
00:58:33,514 --> 00:58:36,350
- What are you doing?
- Oh, shit!

825
00:58:38,619 --> 00:58:39,954
Um...

826
00:58:39,987 --> 00:58:43,024
Look, Dad, I... I know
what this looks like,

827
00:58:43,057 --> 00:58:45,493
but all I'm trying to do
is put the money

828
00:58:45,526 --> 00:58:48,662
- in the bank for you.
- Are you on drugs?

829
00:58:48,696 --> 00:58:51,599
You don't understand.
Luis knows where this money is.

830
00:58:51,632 --> 00:58:55,302
I don't care who Luis is.
Just take your stuff and go.

831
00:58:55,336 --> 00:58:57,104
- You're not listening...
- Leave us alone!

832
00:58:57,138 --> 00:58:58,873
Life was better
when you were in prison.

833
00:58:58,906 --> 00:59:02,543
Just go! Just go! Go!

834
00:59:40,915 --> 00:59:42,583
This is a gun!

835
00:59:43,851 --> 00:59:48,756
All you do is cock it back,

836
00:59:50,458 --> 00:59:53,761
put this, and then bam!
You're dead.

837
00:59:53,794 --> 00:59:55,229
Does that make sense?

838
00:59:56,931 --> 01:00:00,734
Uh, this is yours, I want
to make sure that we're cool,

839
01:00:00,768 --> 01:00:02,369
that, uh, you got
what you need and, uh,

840
01:00:02,403 --> 01:00:03,737
we don't have a problem.

841
01:00:10,244 --> 01:00:11,278
What up?

842
01:00:14,448 --> 01:00:17,351
You think you're tough, huh?
You think you're tough?

843
01:00:18,219 --> 01:00:21,422
I'm someone.
Nobody messes with me.

844
01:00:21,455 --> 01:00:22,524
Nobody.

845
01:00:24,091 --> 01:00:28,195
I'm sure nobody messes with you.
Tells you what to do.

846
01:00:28,229 --> 01:00:31,932
I said don't you mess with me!
I got the gun!

847
01:00:37,171 --> 01:00:38,973
- You're late.
- Hey, I know you.

848
01:00:39,974 --> 01:00:41,876
You got Paco in a headlock.

849
01:00:48,550 --> 01:00:49,950
<i>So what you gonna do?</i>

850
01:00:50,985 --> 01:00:52,853
That's not the way
it went down at, uh...

851
01:00:57,258 --> 01:00:59,326
<i>You know, killing your first one</i>

852
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:01,795
<i>will give you special powers,
yeah.</i>

853
01:01:02,763 --> 01:01:05,399
What about this, man? Huh?

854
01:01:15,776 --> 01:01:17,646
Who's... Who's retarded?

855
01:01:30,824 --> 01:01:33,761
Marcus, what are you doing
with that gun?

856
01:01:33,794 --> 01:01:35,564
Luis gave it to me.

857
01:01:36,565 --> 01:01:39,166
He said that if I keep
this gun on me,

858
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,434
no one will mess with me.

859
01:01:41,869 --> 01:01:42,937
Give me that gun.

860
01:01:44,305 --> 01:01:47,174
You could get hurt, you could
hurt someone, you could go to jail!

861
01:01:51,312 --> 01:01:53,981
No, it's not dangerous.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

862
01:01:54,014 --> 01:01:55,517
Don't point that gun at me.

863
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:57,885
- I'm not gonna hurt you!
- Give me that gun.

864
01:02:01,656 --> 01:02:04,391
I'm... Uh, I'm sorry.

865
01:02:04,425 --> 01:02:07,995
Uh. I didn't mean to scare you.

866
01:02:08,028 --> 01:02:09,430
Can I have the gun back?

867
01:02:10,397 --> 01:02:11,633
I'm giving this gun to Frank.

868
01:02:12,534 --> 01:02:15,302
Luis said if I don't
give the gun back,

869
01:02:15,336 --> 01:02:16,804
he might come after me.

870
01:02:20,874 --> 01:02:22,810
Don't ever bring that gun
back in here again.

871
01:02:23,944 --> 01:02:26,681
I... I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

872
01:02:26,715 --> 01:02:29,083
Gangs have brought nothing
but misery in our family.

873
01:02:38,259 --> 01:02:40,427
All right, come on,
let's pick out a tat.

874
01:02:40,461 --> 01:02:41,495
Okay.

875
01:02:42,731 --> 01:02:46,668
Scroll through there.
Uh, that one?

876
01:02:46,967 --> 01:02:48,102
Relax.

877
01:02:51,238 --> 01:02:52,273
All right.

878
01:02:53,207 --> 01:02:54,775
Shh. It's all right.

879
01:02:56,043 --> 01:02:59,113
Marcus, I want you
to do us a favor.

880
01:03:00,147 --> 01:03:03,217
The Korean family,
they've been taking advantage

881
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:05,419
of us poor people for years.

882
01:03:05,452 --> 01:03:07,154
Now they're going
to raise the prices.

883
01:03:10,592 --> 01:03:12,259
Hey, you're all right,
all right.

884
01:03:12,293 --> 01:03:14,562
Come on, calm down. It's okay.

885
01:03:14,596 --> 01:03:16,030
I'm right here with you, buddy.

886
01:03:19,066 --> 01:03:20,968
That's all right,
that's all right, come on.

887
01:03:21,001 --> 01:03:23,505
Think about it like this:
when the apocalypse comes,

888
01:03:24,739 --> 01:03:27,575
do you think it's fair
that that family's gonna hold

889
01:03:27,609 --> 01:03:30,044
their supplies
and not share 'em with you?

890
01:03:30,077 --> 01:03:32,647
Come on.

891
01:04:44,853 --> 01:04:46,387
<i>Adiós,</i> dawg.

892
01:05:18,085 --> 01:05:21,054
Have you seen this man?
He's one of our clients.

893
01:07:30,518 --> 01:07:31,553
Marcus!

894
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:35,155
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

895
01:07:35,188 --> 01:07:38,960
Here. Hi, it's Me Young.

896
01:07:38,993 --> 01:07:40,762
Come on, let me get you inside.

897
01:07:53,675 --> 01:07:54,709
Come on.

898
01:08:08,022 --> 01:08:11,659
- Breakfast is served.
- Marcus?

899
01:08:11,693 --> 01:08:13,661
Yo, man,
you're wearing my apron.

900
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:15,429
- And where is...
- Mom and Dad?

901
01:08:15,462 --> 01:08:17,599
What did you say? Mom and Dad?

902
01:08:17,632 --> 01:08:18,766
They went for a walk.

903
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:22,102
Mmm, what smells
so good in here?

904
01:08:22,135 --> 01:08:24,872
- It's all right.
- How'd you sleep, Marcus?

905
01:08:24,906 --> 01:08:27,542
Whoa, hold on, hold on, hold on.
You were letting him move in?

906
01:08:27,575 --> 01:08:31,278
- He was sleeping on the porch.
- I don't care.

907
01:08:31,311 --> 01:08:34,616
- He's... He's taking over my life.
- You jealous of Marcus?

908
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:37,085
What?

909
01:08:37,117 --> 01:08:39,621
Are you jealous of a kid
with special needs?

910
01:08:40,989 --> 01:08:42,122
You mean a retard!

911
01:08:44,726 --> 01:08:46,527
Kim, get back in here!

912
01:08:50,598 --> 01:08:53,701
Come on, Marcus,
I'll take you to the laundromat.

913
01:08:53,735 --> 01:08:54,769
Okay.

914
01:09:21,161 --> 01:09:22,930
<i>Sure.</i>

915
01:09:22,964 --> 01:09:25,165
<i>You'd be dead
if it weren't for me.</i>

916
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:26,501
<i>You'd be dead.</i>

917
01:09:26,534 --> 01:09:28,603
Yeah, I don't like
that guy, anyway.

918
01:09:28,636 --> 01:09:30,738
Ooh, there goes his left arm.

919
01:09:30,772 --> 01:09:32,339
Oh, I didn't like him.

920
01:09:32,372 --> 01:09:34,909
It's crazy.
It's like spreading all over.

921
01:09:34,942 --> 01:09:37,244
Hey, did you see I fixed
the security camera?

922
01:09:37,277 --> 01:09:39,681
- Yo, Dad.
- That's... that's... that's good.

923
01:09:39,714 --> 01:09:41,949
- Andrea's gonna die.
- Oh, no!

924
01:09:41,983 --> 01:09:43,584
<i>Oh! Oh!</i>

925
01:09:43,618 --> 01:09:45,987
They're gonna do
a zombie hat dance.

926
01:09:47,155 --> 01:09:50,525
Really? Really, you two?
It's just a TV show.

927
01:09:50,558 --> 01:09:52,093
You know what? Forget it.

928
01:09:52,126 --> 01:09:54,162
Yeah, yeah, you two go ahead,
hang out here,

929
01:09:54,194 --> 01:09:56,363
best friends, and I'm gonna
go back to work and...

930
01:09:56,396 --> 01:09:58,132
All the zombies
are circling her.

931
01:09:58,166 --> 01:09:59,199
Uh-oh!

932
01:10:00,902 --> 01:10:03,236
Same damn thing.

933
01:10:09,177 --> 01:10:11,512
Marcus, I was worried about you.

934
01:10:15,149 --> 01:10:17,618
Hey, calm down!

935
01:10:17,652 --> 01:10:19,887
You're keeping me away
from my family.

936
01:10:21,354 --> 01:10:22,990
Hey, if we leave now,
there's still time

937
01:10:23,024 --> 01:10:24,625
- to catch <i>Apocalyptic Zombies.</i>
- No!

938
01:10:29,597 --> 01:10:32,399
Marcus, we're a zombie family.

939
01:10:32,432 --> 01:10:35,937
- We gotta stay together.
- Zombies don't have families!

940
01:10:37,505 --> 01:10:39,107
Frank, can I see you
outside, please?

941
01:10:47,548 --> 01:10:50,250
You know Marcus is safe
with us, right? He's like family.

942
01:10:50,283 --> 01:10:52,319
You can't take him home
with you. He's not like a pet.

943
01:10:52,352 --> 01:10:55,489
Of course he's not a pet. Why
didn't you just lock him up, then?

944
01:10:55,523 --> 01:10:57,892
You can't lock him up, it's against
their God-given right to be free.

945
01:10:57,925 --> 01:10:59,727
That's why they're not
in an institution.

946
01:10:59,761 --> 01:11:02,764
He's a child's tantrum
inside a giant's body.

947
01:11:02,797 --> 01:11:04,331
What are you talking about?

948
01:11:06,634 --> 01:11:08,202
- Marcus.
- What?!

949
01:11:13,608 --> 01:11:16,409
- I've never seen him like that before.
- He's got to be off his meds.

950
01:11:17,879 --> 01:11:19,914
- Is he dangerous?
- Yes, that's why I came

951
01:11:19,947 --> 01:11:21,682
down here to tell you
you're not safe.

952
01:11:35,495 --> 01:11:36,697
Where did everybody go?

953
01:11:39,834 --> 01:11:41,202
They left me.

954
01:11:41,235 --> 01:11:43,104
Oh, I'm sure
they're around somewhere.

955
01:11:49,510 --> 01:11:53,147
- Here's to Thanksgiving Day lunch.
- Wow!

956
01:11:57,317 --> 01:11:58,385
What?

957
01:12:00,087 --> 01:12:02,156
- Uh...
- What are you looking at?

958
01:12:02,190 --> 01:12:03,224
Uh...

959
01:12:05,358 --> 01:12:08,095
- Dad! You're alive.
- Dad?

960
01:12:08,129 --> 01:12:10,598
- This is my dad.
- No, that's a zombie.

961
01:12:10,631 --> 01:12:12,432
He's not a zombie,
he's just drunk.

962
01:12:12,465 --> 01:12:14,334
He does this all the time,
stumbles around...

963
01:12:14,367 --> 01:12:16,504
Oh, God, Andrea, run.
He's a zombie!

964
01:12:32,653 --> 01:12:33,921
Marcus, what happened?

965
01:12:39,527 --> 01:12:42,362
Do you know
why I am in a group home?

966
01:12:42,395 --> 01:12:43,831
Why?

967
01:12:43,865 --> 01:12:48,336
She said he took one look at me

968
01:12:49,570 --> 01:12:50,905
and left.

969
01:12:51,539 --> 01:12:55,743
- Marcus.
- I took a hose...

970
01:12:57,578 --> 01:12:59,513
pushed her against the wall,

971
01:13:01,649 --> 01:13:04,218
- and beat her with it.
- Marcus.

972
01:13:04,252 --> 01:13:06,053
What...

973
01:13:06,419 --> 01:13:09,090
- Marcus, Marcus...
- The cops...

974
01:13:13,094 --> 01:13:17,397
They took her away from me.
She never came to see me.

975
01:13:17,430 --> 01:13:19,700
- It's okay, Marcus.
- No one wants me!

976
01:13:20,701 --> 01:13:22,904
Marc... Marcus!

977
01:13:40,755 --> 01:13:42,223
Nicole just called.

978
01:13:45,059 --> 01:13:46,327
She'll be here in the morning.

979
01:13:47,929 --> 01:13:48,996
Thanks, buddy.

980
01:14:04,245 --> 01:14:05,313
Oh!

981
01:14:13,621 --> 01:14:14,655
You shouldn't be here.

982
01:14:16,757 --> 01:14:20,294
I'm sorry, I need one more...
I need to work one more day.

983
01:14:21,429 --> 01:14:24,799
I'm... I'm gonna get kicked
out of my group home.

984
01:14:24,832 --> 01:14:27,635
Marcus, you threw me
down on the ground.

985
01:14:28,769 --> 01:14:29,804
You hurt me.

986
01:14:32,006 --> 01:14:33,674
I'm sorry.

987
01:14:36,844 --> 01:14:39,313
But you told me
I need to forgive everybody.

988
01:14:43,617 --> 01:14:45,853
Yeah, I guess I did say that.

989
01:14:48,656 --> 01:14:52,326
All right, let's go do
the money chart one more time,

990
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:53,493
see what you remember.

991
01:15:01,202 --> 01:15:02,403
Four quarters make?

992
01:15:05,473 --> 01:15:07,174
There he is.

993
01:15:07,208 --> 01:15:10,611
Marcus, what's wrong?
Are you okay?

994
01:15:10,644 --> 01:15:11,679
Yo!

995
01:15:17,218 --> 01:15:18,386
No.

996
01:15:18,853 --> 01:15:20,988
- Where's the safe at, Marcus?
- I don't know.

997
01:15:21,022 --> 01:15:22,490
- Where is it at?
- I don't know!

998
01:15:22,523 --> 01:15:23,924
- Where is it at?!
- I don't know!

999
01:15:23,958 --> 01:15:26,293
Oh, you think I'm playing? Huh?

1000
01:15:26,327 --> 01:15:28,095
Do you think I'm playing?

1001
01:15:29,864 --> 01:15:31,999
- Tell me now or I'll kill him.
- Okay, I'll tell you.

1002
01:15:32,033 --> 01:15:33,801
You ain't gonna tell me,
you'll show me.

1003
01:15:33,834 --> 01:15:34,869
Okay, okay.

1004
01:15:37,571 --> 01:15:38,806
It's... it's here.

1005
01:15:38,839 --> 01:15:40,775
Don't hurt me.

1006
01:15:40,808 --> 01:15:42,977
- Oh, please!
- -Come on, man, there's the safe.

1007
01:15:43,010 --> 01:15:44,245
Paco, watch the door.

1008
01:15:45,846 --> 01:15:48,315
Come on. Let's go.

1009
01:15:48,349 --> 01:15:51,185
- Come on, man, open the safe.
- Okay, okay! Oh.

1010
01:15:51,218 --> 01:15:54,355
What's the matter?

1011
01:15:54,388 --> 01:15:57,058
I'm trying. Give me a second,
give me a second.

1012
01:15:57,091 --> 01:15:59,927
- You think this is a game? You'd better try harder.
- No!

1013
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:02,997
I'm not playing with you,
Marcus. Open the safe.

1014
01:16:03,030 --> 01:16:04,832
I'll put a bullet
right through your head.

1015
01:16:04,865 --> 01:16:07,735
- Open it! Get down.
- Okay, okay. Okay.

1016
01:16:07,768 --> 01:16:11,672
Open the safe.
You got five seconds.

1017
01:16:11,705 --> 01:16:14,275
Um... Uh, uh...

1018
01:16:15,242 --> 01:16:17,311
82nd episode,

1019
01:16:17,344 --> 01:16:18,379
um...

1020
01:16:20,081 --> 01:16:22,083
- 33 survivors.
- Three...

1021
01:16:25,252 --> 01:16:27,888
- Two...
- It's 47 zombies.

1022
01:16:27,922 --> 01:16:29,690
One...

1023
01:16:29,723 --> 01:16:32,827
- I'll shoot you, Marcus.
- Oh, no, okay, it's open.

1024
01:16:34,929 --> 01:16:35,963
Yes!

1025
01:16:37,231 --> 01:16:38,966
- Come on, you did good.
- Okay.

1026
01:16:41,702 --> 01:16:42,736
Look at this!

1027
01:16:43,804 --> 01:16:46,273
Get your money on that,
come on, that's your money too!

1028
01:16:49,443 --> 01:16:52,113
Come on, come on, come on.
Go. Let's go.

1029
01:16:53,781 --> 01:16:55,816
We gotta go. We gotta go.
Come on, come on.

1030
01:17:13,568 --> 01:17:17,638
Dad? Dad, Dad, Dad?

1031
01:17:17,671 --> 01:17:21,610
No, no, no, no, no! Dad, Dad,
Dad. What happened? Dad?

1032
01:17:21,642 --> 01:17:23,210
Dad, wake up! Dad.

1033
01:17:27,748 --> 01:17:29,216
Hold on, Dad. Just hold on!

1034
01:17:31,352 --> 01:17:33,888
Whoo!

1035
01:18:00,381 --> 01:18:01,949
- Hi!
- Mom! Mom!

1036
01:18:01,982 --> 01:18:03,951
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- Something's happened to Dad

1037
01:18:03,984 --> 01:18:06,020
<i>at the laundromat.
I don't know what's going on!</i>

1038
01:18:06,053 --> 01:18:07,855
<i>- He won't wake up.</i>
- What?

1039
01:18:07,888 --> 01:18:09,857
- There's blood and I...
<i>- Okay, okay.</i>

1040
01:18:09,890 --> 01:18:12,026
I called an ambulance.
Just get over here, please.

1041
01:18:12,059 --> 01:18:13,994
Okay, okay,
I'll be right there. Bye.

1042
01:18:18,199 --> 01:18:19,333
<i>Appa!</i>

1043
01:18:23,404 --> 01:18:24,438
Marcus...

1044
01:18:29,009 --> 01:18:30,344
Please, Dad!

1045
01:18:33,714 --> 01:18:35,517
Hey!

1046
01:18:45,159 --> 01:18:48,128
Hey, what are you doing?
Hey, come here! Come here!

1047
01:18:50,431 --> 01:18:53,167
- Are you disrespecting me?
- Why are you fucking pushing me like that?

1048
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:55,503
- Why are you dancing on him?
- That's what you want me to do, right?

1049
01:18:55,537 --> 01:18:57,672
- Huh?
- Quit playing with me. Huh?

1050
01:18:57,706 --> 01:18:59,173
What I want you to do:

1051
01:18:59,206 --> 01:19:01,041
I don't want you
disrespecting me no more.

1052
01:19:01,075 --> 01:19:02,577
- Get the fuck off me.
- That's disrespecting me.

1053
01:19:09,618 --> 01:19:11,686
Looks like Marcus cares
about me more than you.

1054
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:13,887
- Oh, you like that?
- Makes you mad, doesn't it?

1055
01:19:15,889 --> 01:19:17,891
Get off me, fucker.

1056
01:19:20,794 --> 01:19:22,664
Sophia!

1057
01:19:24,231 --> 01:19:26,668
Fuck her, man.
Yo, get this money, man.

1058
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:21,523
Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!

1059
01:20:22,923 --> 01:20:23,957
Take the money.

1060
01:20:25,192 --> 01:20:26,327
Take the money.

1061
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:29,897
Take it, take it, go!

1062
01:20:39,106 --> 01:20:40,542
Go, go, go!

1063
01:21:07,968 --> 01:21:10,204
- I...
- Marcus!

1064
01:21:10,237 --> 01:21:11,773
The hell
are you doing here, man?

1065
01:21:11,806 --> 01:21:13,941
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
- You're sorry?

1066
01:21:13,974 --> 01:21:16,110
- Yes. Yes.
- You're sorry?

1067
01:21:16,143 --> 01:21:19,179
I just wanted to apologize.

1068
01:21:19,213 --> 01:21:21,649
- Apologize?
- Yeah, yeah.

1069
01:21:21,683 --> 01:21:23,283
Do you know what you did?

1070
01:21:23,317 --> 01:21:25,854
No, I mean, I just, I'm sorry.

1071
01:21:25,886 --> 01:21:27,454
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

1072
01:21:28,889 --> 01:21:32,226
Yes. I didn't... I didn't mean
for all of it to happen.

1073
01:21:32,259 --> 01:21:34,596
- Marcus, shut up.
- I'm sorry.

1074
01:21:37,599 --> 01:21:39,534
Just get out of here, man.

1075
01:21:40,668 --> 01:21:41,703
Okay.

1076
01:21:51,912 --> 01:21:53,147
Shit.

1077
01:22:02,122 --> 01:22:03,157
Hey, Marcus.

1078
01:22:05,259 --> 01:22:08,730
Hey, get in the car.

1079
01:23:28,776 --> 01:23:30,244
I think you should see
your mother.

1080
01:23:33,982 --> 01:23:36,784
We'll have
the apocalyptic Thanksgiving

1081
01:23:36,818 --> 01:23:38,218
I always wanted.

1082
01:24:43,083 --> 01:24:44,418
Who the hell is that?

1083
01:24:47,220 --> 01:24:48,255
What do you want?

1084
01:24:51,059 --> 01:24:53,160
I'm... I'm your son Marcus.

1085
01:24:57,565 --> 01:25:03,270
Oh, my God. Marcus?

1086
01:25:03,303 --> 01:25:04,338
Yeah.

1087
01:25:05,405 --> 01:25:07,842
Oh, honey.

1088
01:25:09,409 --> 01:25:11,613
Mama, why did you put me
in a group home?

1089
01:25:17,451 --> 01:25:21,923
I n... I... I really never meant
to do that, Marcus.

1090
01:25:21,956 --> 01:25:23,524
I never meant to do that.

1091
01:25:23,558 --> 01:25:27,528
I... I... I love you, Mama.

1092
01:25:29,063 --> 01:25:31,733
I love you too, sugar pie.

1093
01:25:31,766 --> 01:25:33,668
Oh, I love you so much.

1094
01:25:35,069 --> 01:25:37,939
Boy, look at you
after all this time.

1095
01:25:37,972 --> 01:25:42,777
Goddamn, I got me a big, fine,
handsome son. Look at you, Marcus!

1096
01:25:44,012 --> 01:25:45,046
Wow!

1097
01:25:46,514 --> 01:25:48,348
Happy Thanksgiving, Mama.

1098
01:25:49,282 --> 01:25:51,451
Oh, happy Thanksgiving, pumpkin.

1099
01:25:52,452 --> 01:25:53,955
Did you bring me anything?

1100
01:25:55,422 --> 01:25:58,993
Yeah, yeah, I got you...
I got a... Look, I...

1101
01:25:59,027 --> 01:26:02,362
It's an action figure
from the 23rd episode

1102
01:26:02,396 --> 01:26:04,464
of <i>Apocalyptic Zombies,</i>

1103
01:26:04,498 --> 01:26:06,134
when they have
to escape through the...

1104
01:26:06,166 --> 01:26:08,301
Zombie what, Marcus?

1105
01:26:08,335 --> 01:26:09,971
That's what you brought me?

1106
01:26:10,004 --> 01:26:11,906
That's what you brought me,
Marcus, huh?

1107
01:26:14,307 --> 01:26:17,078
Marcus, you still retarded!

1108
01:26:19,346 --> 01:26:20,915
Let me tell you something.

1109
01:26:20,948 --> 01:26:22,315
You want to know why

1110
01:26:22,349 --> 01:26:23,918
I couldn't take care
of you, Marcus?

1111
01:26:25,452 --> 01:26:28,556
Do you want to know why I
put you in that home, Marcus?

1112
01:26:29,824 --> 01:26:32,593
We could have been together.
We could have made it,

1113
01:26:32,627 --> 01:26:34,829
you know, we could have made it.

1114
01:26:34,862 --> 01:26:41,201
But you, you used to kick,
bite, and fight me all the time,

1115
01:26:41,234 --> 01:26:45,773
- Marcus, all of the time.
- I'm sorry.

1116
01:26:45,807 --> 01:26:48,609
Do you remember
the day at the car wash?

1117
01:26:48,643 --> 01:26:51,344
When you hit me
with that hose, Marcus.

1118
01:26:51,378 --> 01:26:53,848
Do you remember
that day at the car wash?

1119
01:26:53,881 --> 01:26:57,719
- Yes!
- The cops took me to jail for dealing!

1120
01:26:57,752 --> 01:27:00,220
They drove me to jail, Marcus,

1121
01:27:00,253 --> 01:27:03,958
- 'cause of your dumb ass.
- I'm sorry.

1122
01:27:03,991 --> 01:27:07,427
Oh, baby we could have made it,
though. I had the perfect thing.

1123
01:27:07,461 --> 01:27:10,531
Used-up, old druggie
and her retarded son

1124
01:27:10,565 --> 01:27:12,667
seek redemption. Amen.

1125
01:27:12,700 --> 01:27:15,302
Oh, yeah, that would have been
the best hustle.

1126
01:27:15,335 --> 01:27:21,509
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

1127
01:27:21,542 --> 01:27:26,413
Look at you. What do you want?

1128
01:27:27,414 --> 01:27:28,683
Time!

1129
01:27:28,716 --> 01:27:30,551
Wait a minute.

1130
01:27:30,585 --> 01:27:32,520
You know what?

1131
01:27:32,553 --> 01:27:34,922
God didn't give me
no star athlete

1132
01:27:34,956 --> 01:27:37,357
or no computer genius.

1133
01:27:37,390 --> 01:27:40,228
He gave me a monster.
You're a monster.

1134
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:42,864
- Look, I said time.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute!

1135
01:27:42,897 --> 01:27:45,767
- Stop! You see how they treat me up in here?!
- Wait! Hey!

1136
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:47,535
- You see what they do to me?
- Wait!

1137
01:27:47,568 --> 01:27:51,005
- It's because of you!
- Hey, get off my mama!

1138
01:27:51,038 --> 01:27:52,840
Mama never stopped
thinking about you.

1139
01:27:52,874 --> 01:27:54,575
Hey, get off of her!

1140
01:27:54,609 --> 01:27:57,477
No, Mama! No, Mama, no!

1141
01:27:58,880 --> 01:27:59,947
Sorry.

1142
01:28:01,149 --> 01:28:02,583
I'm sorry!

1143
01:28:50,463 --> 01:28:52,300
Happy Thanksgiving, Marcus.

1144
01:28:52,332 --> 01:28:54,602
Got Salisbury steak
and mashed potatoes.

1145
01:28:54,635 --> 01:28:57,271
Here barbecue ribs
and mac and cheese.

1146
01:28:57,305 --> 01:28:59,073
Salisbury steak, mac and cheese.

1147
01:29:01,008 --> 01:29:02,375
I know you like mac and cheese.

1148
01:29:06,514 --> 01:29:07,915
All right,
I'll put it over here.

1149
01:29:14,822 --> 01:29:16,157
I'm sorry about your mother.

1150
01:29:20,962 --> 01:29:22,630
She doesn't realize
how special you are.

1151
01:29:28,502 --> 01:29:30,338
I gotta get this.

1152
01:29:35,009 --> 01:29:37,578
Marcus.

1153
01:29:38,378 --> 01:29:39,847
Who is it?

1154
01:29:39,881 --> 01:29:40,915
Hi!

1155
01:29:43,751 --> 01:29:47,255
Hi! Nicole said
that somebody was moving out.

1156
01:29:47,922 --> 01:29:49,924
Oh, wow.

1157
01:29:50,524 --> 01:29:52,526
This place is more beautiful
than the pictures.

1158
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:53,728
Doug!

1159
01:29:53,761 --> 01:29:56,230
- Oh, you must be Frank.
- Yes.

1160
01:29:56,264 --> 01:29:58,232
- Nicole was wrong...
- I'll take it.

1161
01:29:58,266 --> 01:30:00,334
No, Nicole was wrong.
There's no room available.

1162
01:30:00,368 --> 01:30:02,536
Look, I'm sorry.
Yeah, I didn't know

1163
01:30:02,570 --> 01:30:05,405
that you wanted to stay here.
I thought you were moving out.

1164
01:30:06,908 --> 01:30:09,310
I haven't signed
the papers, Doug.

1165
01:30:13,781 --> 01:30:15,482
Zombies are so yesterday.

1166
01:30:18,586 --> 01:30:20,221
Marcus!

1167
01:30:20,254 --> 01:30:23,257
No, Marcus! Marcus! Marcus!

1168
01:31:18,746 --> 01:31:20,548
Did you fix
the security cameras?

1169
01:31:20,581 --> 01:31:23,317
- Dad, just watch the video, please.
- -<i>Paco, watch the door.</i>

1170
01:31:23,351 --> 01:31:25,553
- <i>All right. Come on! Come on.
- No, no, no, no, no.</i>

1171
01:31:25,586 --> 01:31:28,823
<i>Okay, okay, no!
No, no, no!</i>

1172
01:31:28,856 --> 01:31:30,490
<i>- Open it!
- Okay.</i>

1173
01:31:30,524 --> 01:31:34,328
<i>It's the 82nd episode,</i>

1174
01:31:34,362 --> 01:31:38,432
<i>um, 33 zombies,</i>

1175
01:31:38,466 --> 01:31:42,103
<i>- 47 survivors...
- I'ma shoot you, Marcus.</i>

1176
01:31:42,136 --> 01:31:44,972
<i>No! No, okay,
it's open! It's open!</i>

1177
01:31:45,006 --> 01:31:47,641
<i>Come on, come on, come on.
You did good. Hold that.</i>

1178
01:31:47,675 --> 01:31:49,677
<i>- Hold that! Hold that!
- Okay.</i>

1179
01:31:52,013 --> 01:31:55,816
- Okay, enough.
<i>- Good job, Marcus. Get that money.</i>

1180
01:31:57,018 --> 01:32:00,521
I knew he was not to be trusted.
He stole our life savings.

1181
01:32:00,554 --> 01:32:03,090
No. No, Mom, Dad.
No, Dad, Dad, he...

1182
01:32:03,524 --> 01:32:04,725
He saved your life. I...

1183
01:32:07,862 --> 01:32:10,231
Those guys wouldn't have been
there if it wasn't for me.

1184
01:32:12,199 --> 01:32:14,535
I... I take full responsibility
for my...

1185
01:32:20,007 --> 01:32:22,043
I accept full responsibility...

1186
01:32:25,813 --> 01:32:28,249
...f... for my actions.

1187
01:32:32,887 --> 01:32:35,689
I'm not asking either one of you
to forgive me, okay?

1188
01:32:35,723 --> 01:32:39,260
I just... Please forgive Marcus.

1189
01:32:42,363 --> 01:32:43,964
Don't... Don't press charges.

1190
01:33:15,564 --> 01:33:18,065
When they put me
on the electric chair...

1191
01:33:21,635 --> 01:33:23,771
...and I resurrect
as a zombie...

1192
01:33:26,107 --> 01:33:29,276
...will you be the one
to take me out?

1193
01:33:31,045 --> 01:33:32,346
With a chainsaw.

1194
01:34:23,164 --> 01:34:24,465
We have to forgive.

1195
01:34:27,502 --> 01:34:28,537
Help me.

1196
01:34:39,180 --> 01:34:42,983
Happy Thanksgiving.
Welcome back.

1197
01:34:43,017 --> 01:34:46,487
- I'm happy to be back, Mrs. Smith.
- Hmm.

1198
01:34:46,521 --> 01:34:51,192
And I'm sorry about your plant.
That was rude of me.

1199
01:34:51,225 --> 01:34:52,826
Well, that's okay.

1200
01:34:52,860 --> 01:34:54,828
Well, Marcus,
Frank told me everything,

1201
01:34:54,862 --> 01:34:57,765
including how you helped
the police arrest a gang.

1202
01:34:57,798 --> 01:34:59,934
Yeah, I took those suckers down.

1203
01:34:59,967 --> 01:35:03,270
<i>Happy Thanksgiving.

<i>Gobble, gobble, Marcus.</i>

1205
01:35:20,522 --> 01:35:22,691
Now, you two are sure
you're gonna be okay

1206
01:35:22,723 --> 01:35:25,059

Thank you.

1209
01:35:57,726 --> 01:35:59,026
Frank, who's at the door?

1210
01:36:01,996 --> 01:36:04,465
- Who's at the door?
- Who is that?

1211
01:36:07,368 --> 01:36:09,003
- Oh, you're here?
- Yes.

Doris' Group Home,
Marcus speaking.

1215
01:36:21,448 --> 01:36:25,386
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Oh, hi, Mama.

1216
01:36:25,419 --> 01:36:27,021
How was your Thanksgiving?

1217
01:36:27,054 --> 01:36:30,592
Me and Frank, we ate
turkey all day, yeah.

1218
01:36:30,625 --> 01:36:36,564
He said I can eat all I want
'cause zombies eat all day, so.

1219
01:36:36,598 --> 01:36:39,366
Oh, that's nice,
that's nice, sweetheart.

1220
01:36:39,400 --> 01:36:41,703
- Look when you come at Christmas...
- All day.

1221
01:36:41,736 --> 01:36:44,271
<i>...can you bring me
some money?</i>

1222
01:36:44,305 --> 01:36:47,374
<i>All you have to do is put it
in my prison account, okay?</i>

1223
01:36:47,408 --> 01:36:50,377
Yeah, okay.
No, I have to go now.

1224
01:36:50,411 --> 01:36:52,046
Can you do that
for your poor mama?

1225
01:36:52,079 --> 01:36:53,480
<i>Bring me some money, please?</i>

1226
01:36:53,515 --> 01:36:55,550
Yeah, my show's on.

1227
01:36:55,583 --> 01:36:57,384
<i>Please bring me some money.</i>

1228
01:36:57,418 --> 01:37:00,888
- No, my show's on.
<i>- Please, Marcus.</i>

1229
01:37:00,921 --> 01:37:03,658
My show's on!

1230
01:37:03,692 --> 01:37:07,161
- Okay, bye.
- Marcus! Marcus, Mama loves you!

1231
01:37:07,194 --> 01:37:10,197
Damn it, shit!

1232
01:37:16,970 --> 01:37:18,005
Hi, Marcus.

1233
01:37:31,352 --> 01:37:32,587
Marcus, what's wrong?

1234
01:37:50,572 --> 01:37:52,106
Marcus, you're a trickster.

1235
01:37:52,139 --> 01:37:54,375
Ah, get some popcorn.

1236
01:38:02,684 --> 01:38:05,386
Sharon's alive! Sharon's alive!
Oh, my gosh!

1237
01:38:05,419 --> 01:38:08,723
We thought she was dead. We thought
she was gonna be a zomb, but she's not!

1238
01:38:35,115 --> 01:38:37,886
- Mom?
- Andrea?

1239
01:38:37,918 --> 01:38:40,053
Andrea!

1240
01:38:40,087 --> 01:38:43,490
Aw, they're together.

1241
01:38:43,924 --> 01:38:46,561
They're reunited again.
They're like a family, Frank.

1242
01:38:46,594 --> 01:38:50,532
They're like us
'cause we're a happy family.

1243
01:38:50,565 --> 01:38:53,467
That's right,
just like we're a family.

1244
01:38:55,804 --> 01:38:57,471
Happy Thanksgiving, Mom.

1245
01:39:00,140 --> 01:39:01,576
Happy Thanksgiving, darling.

1246
01:39:07,715 --> 01:39:10,250
Your dad would have really liked
to have been here with us today.

1247
01:39:11,251 --> 01:39:14,354
The end of the show.

1248
01:39:14,388 --> 01:39:18,292
- Yeah!
- Yeah! The show! It's my show!

1249
01:39:18,325 --> 01:39:20,394
Can we watch it again?
Rewind it! Rewind it!

1250
01:39:20,427 --> 01:39:22,931
Good episode! Yeah!

1251
01:39:35,976 --> 01:39:38,513
I'm a zombie. Ah!
