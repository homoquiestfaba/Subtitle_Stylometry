1
00:02:15,244 --> 00:02:16,535
Hello.

2
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,611
They call me doom-head.

3
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:29,281
Now, I don't call myself
doom-head, mind you,
but they do.

4
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,219
Who's they?

5
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:39,892
Well, some mysterious folks
that pay me a whole lot
of scratch to do what I do.

6
00:02:39,894 --> 00:02:43,729
And what I do,
unfortunately for you...

7
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:48,433
I do real well.

8
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:52,838
Now.

9
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,876
Let's get one thing
between us straight.

10
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:06,251
I ain't no fucking clown.

11
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:11,190
Now Mr. p.T. Barnum may claim
clowns are the pegs on which
this circus is hung...

12
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:17,229
But I isn't no fucking clown.

13
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:23,202
Now you may think you see a
grease-painted performer
sitting before you

14
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:27,806
who would usually
elicit an amused response
from an audience,

15
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:28,974
but trust me.

16
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:31,877
You do not.

17
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,714
I'm not here to make you happy.

18
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,819
I'm not here to brighten
your dismal day

19
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:45,557
and I am certainly not here
to elicit an amused response.

20
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:51,396
I am here to end your
miserable fucking life.

21
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:56,969
But first...

22
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:07,613
Mm.

23
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:10,515
First,

24
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,952
I'm gonna bless you
with a story.

25
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:21,293
See I don't think the last
sound to puncture your
ear drums should be

26
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:24,329
the twang of your
body falling apart.

27
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:28,033
Snap! Oooh.

28
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:29,735
Crunch.

29
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:35,574
Interesting fact:

30
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:41,480
Did you know that a cockroach
can live up to 168 hours
without a head?

31
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:49,421
I find this... fascinating.

32
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:55,594
But what really blows
my fucking marbles

33
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:59,831
like a 50-cent skank,

34
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:03,435
I mean the real mind-fucker,

35
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:07,839
is that for several more hours
this same decapitated head

36
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:12,010
will keep on truckin' for Jesus.

37
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:14,913
If properly nourished,
of course.

38
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:21,386
You know, all in all,
you've had a pretty good run.

39
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:26,825
But, uh, deep down inside
you must have known
it all had to end somewhere.

40
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:31,730
Might as well be here.
Might as well be now.

41
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:34,866
And it might as well be with me.

42
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:41,807
Where's my wife?
What did you sick bastards
do to my beautiful wife?

43
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:44,576
She's the mother of
our two beautiful girls.

44
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:48,847
Rebecca, Josephine,
they're beautiful,
they're just like her, please.

45
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,382
Oh.

46
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:53,819
I know where she is.

47
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:59,558
Two little clowns I know
took a fancy to her.

48
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,595
So I think she might be sticking
around for a bit, huh?

49
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:06,898
...though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of
death I fear no evil--

50
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:13,905
Christ almighty,
you Jesus freaks are
so fucking sensitive, huh?

51
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:17,409
Shit.

52
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:20,679
You should be thanking me, man.

53
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:26,752
I'm sending you straight to
the fucking pearly gates
with a first-class ticket.

54
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:45,137
I should apologize in advance
for not sharpening this thing.

55
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:50,509
It might take
a couple of extra whacks.

56
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:53,412
Listen to me. Listen to me,
please, I'm begging you.
I'm begging you.

57
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:59,184
You don't have...
You don't have to do this.

58
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:04,689
We can all walk away.
Bring Georgina to me.

59
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:06,958
And you let us walk away,
no one would know.

60
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,860
- Fuck it.
- No, no.

61
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:12,063
You know what they say,
kemosabe, in hell,

62
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,535
everybody loves popcorn.

63
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:30,816
Number fucking two.

64
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:25,350
Hey Randy, man,
i hope you know that "e"
stands for "empty." Not "eat."

65
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:29,721
I am hungry,
but that's not possible.

66
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:31,022
Check it.

67
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:36,261
Oh, suck my motherfucking balls!

68
00:11:36,263 --> 00:11:37,862
No thanks.

69
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,264
How am I supposed to work with

70
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:41,032
this inferior goddamn equipment?

71
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,834
Is that what the ladies
are calling it now?

72
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:48,473
Trust me, my doo-Wally's
working fine.

73
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:50,442
Hey, look here boy,

74
00:11:50,444 --> 00:11:53,344
if this monster break down
here in the ass of nowhere

75
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:55,880
you gon' get your lard ass out
there and you gon' push

76
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,316
with the bumper up your ass.

77
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:03,354
Venus, I think it might be time
to bring back the girl into a
gorilla-lusion.

78
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:04,823
Oh, you all got a gorilla?

79
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:06,391
Yeah I got a fucking gorilla,

80
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,226
he's in my pants,
i call him king dong.

81
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,195
Whoa, hey, whoa filly.

82
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:12,997
- I assume you're joking.
- I am not.

83
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:16,334
I mean, haven't we got enough to
worry about, without you

84
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:17,836
framing up a new show?

85
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:19,871
I mean, besides,

86
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:22,240
who's gonna hustle
this other shit?

87
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,209
You think I want to be
a fucking mechanic?

88
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:27,178
Fixing these death traps
the rest of my life?

89
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,114
I mean, I got dreams.

90
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:32,283
And they do not include yanking
some kid's chewed up arm

91
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:34,052
out of the gears of a
tilt-a-whirl.

92
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:36,221
Baby, I got dreams too.
You go for it.

93
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,856
Get the fuck off me.

94
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:40,024
Hey, baby girl,

95
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:42,794
I mean, what do you think
about that talent back there?

96
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:44,863
I mean, the one with
the lop-sided high beams,

97
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:46,898
I mean, I don't know,
she's either drunk or retarded.

98
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,867
Seriously?

99
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:53,004
She's gonna twitch and itch
her ass all around the mid-way.

100
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:55,507
Uh-huh, just like
all the new babies do.

101
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:58,777
- But that's why I afraid.
- Hmm?

102
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:00,445
A new wave of crap's coming.

103
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,380
- Oh...

104
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:04,783
So what exactly is the name
of this show of yours?

105
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:06,951
Okay, dig this.

106
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:11,156
Professor houldini's
mad gorilla monster show.

107
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:13,925
Ooh, I'd go see that show.

108
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:17,962
The name's got some grab,
but you're still
minus one jungle girl.

109
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:21,566
Oh, I could be a jungle girl,
i took a acting class
before I left high school.

110
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:23,468
Just shut the fuck up
for two seconds.

111
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:27,972
That's where charly girl
comes in.

112
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:32,977
Charly hardly looks
like a wild woman of Borneo.

113
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,914
Besides, you know the chi is my
main hustle in the girly show.

114
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:39,984
Okay, we dump the whole Borneo
shit, okay? We work a new angle.

115
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,220
The yokels had burnt out
on that yarn ten years ago.

116
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:45,023
What's a yokel?

117
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:49,360
What's the word on this wacky
weed this fine sunny, sunny
day, sweet jolly girl?

118
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:54,265
The midwest says sweet jolly,
she got some sweet rasta shit.

119
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:58,236
- Boo-ya-ka, boo-ya-ka.
- Oh my sweet jolly,

120
00:13:58,238 --> 00:14:00,138
pass your brothers a hit.

121
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,174
Ah, it isn't mine, baby.

122
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,844
Yeah, there boy.

123
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:08,413
I gotta keep my eyes
on the road.

124
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:10,148
This shit's the real deal.

125
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:14,085
Think you two can handle it?

126
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:15,854
I try, I try.

127
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:18,056
First hit's free.

128
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:21,059
After that you lay
out the green,

129
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:25,096
before jolly gets too mean.

130
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:27,298
Shit, warm it up for her.

131
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,033
Mm-hmm.

132
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,102
Levon, I gotta get in there.

133
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:35,907
- Levon!
- Go away!

134
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:37,342
Hey, it isn't the levon show.

135
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:38,610
Go away!

136
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:40,912
Come on, man.

137
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:43,414
I just gotta get something out
of the--i gotta get--

138
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,884
oh, god damn man,
can't you see I'm
busy back here?

139
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:48,253
Oh, shit, that's a lot of woman.

140
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:50,021
Yeah, what you want that's
so important you got to
crash my love den?

141
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:51,956
You're going to give
that man a heart attack.

142
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:55,326
Tell it again, I don't get it.
Who had the cake?

143
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:59,364
Oh, Christ, bitch,
pay attention this time.

144
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:02,467
There was a boy, named Harold.

145
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:04,435
Walked in on his
grandparents having sex.

146
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:08,072
Pretty much like this asshole
don' walked in on me.

147
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:11,376
Harold said, "grandma!
Whatcha' doing?"

148
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:15,213
Grandma say,
"well, we bakin' a cake.

149
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:20,652
A few days later, Harold say,
"grandma, was you and grandpa
baking a cake last night?

150
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:24,923
Grandma says, "matter of fact,
we was. How'd you know?"

151
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:30,028
Harold say,
"because I just licked
some frosting off the couch."

152
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,596
I still don't get it.

153
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,264
What frosting?
Where'd it come from?

154
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,700
The old man's dick!

155
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:38,136
The old bastard's jizz
was the frosting.

156
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:40,038
Oh...

157
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:45,276
Hello Congo,
oh how I missed you.

158
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,346
Oh, come on, Roscoe,
go get your ass out of here.

159
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:50,581
- Oh, shit.
- I'll get out in a second.
What do you think?

160
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:53,584
- I think it's cute.
- It isn't cute.

161
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:55,086
So do I.

162
00:15:57,223 --> 00:16:00,525
Roscoe get on, get your ass out
of here, you gotta go, now, man!

163
00:16:00,527 --> 00:16:04,295
- Go on, man! God damn.

164
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:07,632
- Pull away that thing, oh.
- Come here.

165
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:13,438
Hey, see?
It still looks boss. Okay?

166
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,473
- Okay I'll think about it.
- I just have to
clean it up a little.

167
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,675
I'll think about it, king dong,
I'll think about it.

168
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:03,154
Hey, oldie!

169
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:04,722
Got any gas today?

170
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:07,792
It's a cocksucking
gas station isn't it?

171
00:17:07,794 --> 00:17:11,262
All right then, fill up
this big bitch pronto.

172
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:16,100
Any of you dumb cunts in
that ridiculous machine
know how to read?

173
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:18,503
Or are you still
using sign language?

174
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:23,041
Hey old man, I know how to read.

175
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,512
Then read it and weep, genius.

176
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:30,481
Back side.

177
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:33,284
Got a whole lot of lazy eff-ers
here in this world, man.

178
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:54,772
Hi.

179
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:56,541
You diggin' what you see, pops?

180
00:17:56,543 --> 00:17:58,443
I reckon I do.

181
00:17:58,445 --> 00:17:59,577
Ooh.

182
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,382
You can call me Leo.

183
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:07,185
Lucky Leo, if you
know what I mean.

184
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:10,254
Oh really? Do you feel lucky?

185
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:14,325
I got a mattress out back
and a couple of jugs
of gut-burner.

186
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:16,828
- Hah!

187
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,163
Trust me, Leo.

188
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:22,567
Your prehistoric ticker couldn't
survive the ride. Ha ha ha.

189
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:24,669
- Whoo!
- Charly...

190
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:26,838
Stop fucking with the locals.

191
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,373
Gimme a break.

192
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,776
I'm just making friends.

193
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:34,145
You want to be my friend,
don't you, Leo?

194
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:36,714
You know I do.

195
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:39,383
See? Just making friends.

196
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,589
You've had enough friends
for a lifetime.

197
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,665
Nice puppets, Leo.

198
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,367
You play with that stuff?

199
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,438
I bet you do.

200
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:05,877
The good lord pray me
for every day,

201
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:08,746
he want me to leave
a righteous way.

202
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:11,849
So I don't care what
the white man say.

203
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:15,653
Santa claus is a black man.

204
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:18,589
You know, I'm thinking man,
when we get ourself a break

205
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:20,925
we need to check out the sound
system in the carousel.

206
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:23,394
Man, them speakers, man,
they shot up to shit.

207
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:26,531
Seriously though, it looks like
I'm losing my shit,

208
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:28,432
I don't normally have
this much forehead.

209
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:30,902
Too young for that.

210
00:19:30,904 --> 00:19:34,572
Hey man, look, it gon' do
what it gon' do.

211
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:36,941
Yeah, but that's easy
for you to say.

212
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:40,745
Shit take a god damn nuclear
blast to damage that foxy 'doo
of yours,

213
00:19:40,747 --> 00:19:43,915
my shit goes south,
i can't do no Isaac Hayes.

214
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:45,783
Will you teach us something?

215
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:48,553
I'll teach you something,
they won't hurt you.

216
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:52,323
There's only four things you
need to know about this career.

217
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:55,960
This is the answer it all.

218
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:58,663
All right.

219
00:19:58,665 --> 00:20:01,499
Sucky, sucky, sucky.

220
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:04,368
Fucky, fucky, fucky.

221
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:07,205
Juicy, juicy, juicy.

222
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:10,208
Money, money, money!

223
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,728
Hey, sailor.

224
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,397
How many seaman you got
in that tin can?

225
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:36,834
Too many.

226
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:38,436
Why, you need a lift?

227
00:20:38,438 --> 00:20:40,972
Mm, maybe.

228
00:20:40,974 --> 00:20:43,374
I could fit in
very tight spaces.

229
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:45,343
I bet you can.

230
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,714
So can I.

231
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:53,684
Ya'll headed up Jackson
way to go hunting?

232
00:20:53,686 --> 00:20:57,255
No, we're just plowing straight
on through to ardleyville.

233
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:09,033
Plannin' on doin' some huntin'?

234
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:12,670
Now, why are you so concerned
with me going huntin'?

235
00:21:12,672 --> 00:21:15,339
Oh, just wondering.

236
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:19,310
You got that domineering great
white hunter vibe.

237
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:23,347
Uh, yeah,
it just comes natural.

238
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:26,450
But we isn't got nothing
of any firearms on this truck,

239
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:28,886
other than a busted old shotgun.

240
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:30,855
Oh, what's it for?

241
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:32,923
Propping open the air vent.

242
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,634
What if you get in a jam?

243
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,636
Well then I guess I...

244
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:52,877
Bust out my old trusty crowbar
and back it up with one
of these guns.

245
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,814
Oh...

246
00:21:56,816 --> 00:22:00,685
Pop. See you later, popeye.

247
00:22:00,687 --> 00:22:03,354
I'ma go get me some spinach.

248
00:22:03,356 --> 00:22:05,623
Oh yeah you are.

Real fast,

259
00:22:53,573 --> 00:22:59,910
Just because some hillbilly sets
up a Halloween la-la in the
middle of the god damn road...

260
00:22:59,912 --> 00:23:04,415
- How about movin' this shit to
the side of the road, man?
- What do you mean?

261

Tonight, we are
going to play 31.

00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:28,559
What is 31, pray tell?

284
00:25:28,561 --> 00:25:33,230
Ah, ha ha, well, 31 is war.

285
00:25:33,232 --> 00:25:38,969
And as the old saying goes,
war is hell.

286
00:25:40,573 --> 00:25:45,809
In exactly 120 seconds,
we will begin.

own private little hell.

to do to survive?

00:26:26,652 --> 00:26:31,755
Fear not. We have some very
colorful heads for you tonight.

and for one reason only.

- You almost took off my god
damn head.
- No shit.

320
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:03,167
- See anybody else?
- Negative.

- It could be a trap.
- This whole god damn
thing is an effing trap.

fucking knife so far
up your fucking ass.

342
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:59,576
I might like that.

343
00:32:59,578 --> 00:33:01,478
You're a fucking chihuahua.

344
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:06,616
You think it's funny?

345
00:33:09,021 --> 00:33:11,254
Open the fucking gate!

346
00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:12,689
Fuck you.

347
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:14,558
I'm coming for you, boy.

348
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:18,061
Number four always dies first.

349
00:33:18,063 --> 00:33:19,596
We're going to get so friendly,

350
00:33:19,598 --> 00:33:22,199
it's going to kill you.

351
00:33:22,201 --> 00:33:24,101
I'm fucking coming for you.

352
00:33:25,771 --> 00:33:27,771
Open the fucking gate.

353
00:33:27,773 --> 00:33:30,340
Open the fucking gate.

354
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:33,744
-- I'm coming for you.

355
00:33:33,746 --> 00:33:36,313
- I'm coming for you.
- I'm fucking coming for you!

356
00:33:36,315 --> 00:33:39,016
I'm fucking coming for you.

357
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:40,277
Trick or treat you are dead,

358
00:34:40,279 --> 00:34:44,448
I will smash your fucking head.

359
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:48,819
Trick or treat, you are dead,

360
00:34:48,821 --> 00:34:53,523
I will smash your fucking head.

361
00:34:53,525 --> 00:34:58,395
Trick or treat, you are dead,

362
00:34:58,397 --> 00:35:03,433
I will smash your fucking head.

363
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:09,673
Trick or treat, you are dead,

364
00:35:09,675 --> 00:35:14,444
I will smash your fucking head.

365
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:31,688
Whoa, girl! Cool it with
the bat. I'm on your side.

366
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:37,827
Come on now, child,
let's get the fuck out of here.

367
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:55,245
- Fuck!
- God damn bitch!

368
00:36:55,247 --> 00:36:56,947
You somethin' with that slugger.

369
00:36:56,949 --> 00:36:58,982
- Is he dead?
- I don't know.

370
00:36:58,984 --> 00:37:00,951
Son of a bitch,
i think I broke his neck.

371
00:37:00,953 --> 00:37:02,786
Shit, where did he get me?

372
00:37:02,788 --> 00:37:04,521
I can't tell,
i think in the shoulder blade.

373
00:37:04,523 --> 00:37:06,289
- Fuck.
- I got to stop the bleeding.

374
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:10,360
- Here put some pressure here.
- Ah! God!

375
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,664
<i> Hola puta! Hola!</i>

376
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:18,668
Get away from me.

377
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,639
Get away from me! Come on!

378
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:27,677
Come on.

379
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:30,480
Come on.

380
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:06,850
You better run, number five.

381
00:38:06,852 --> 00:38:10,620
'Cause I'm gonna go kill
number four and then
I'm gonna come back for you

382
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,889
and I'm gonna kill
you nice and slow.

383
00:38:12,891 --> 00:38:15,825
Okay? Run and hide.

384
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:16,993
Go hide.

385
00:38:16,995 --> 00:38:18,695
Fuck.

386
00:38:22,034 --> 00:38:26,970
- Ah, damn.
-<i> Ten hours and forty-three</i>
<i> minutes.</i>

387
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:29,606
<i> Anything can still happen.</i>

388
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:34,878
<i> Hola!</i>

389
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:55,632
Does that hurt, huh?

390
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:01,738
Are you okay?

391
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:09,612
- I thought you were my brother.
- Fuck you, boy.

392
00:39:09,614 --> 00:39:10,947
Fuck you.

393
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:12,782
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

394
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:14,718
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

395
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,886
Fuck...

396
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,824
You ready to die?

397
00:39:20,826 --> 00:39:23,526
Just fucking do it.

398
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:25,762
Just fucking do it!

399
00:40:46,912 --> 00:40:48,778
Hold up, do you hear that?

400
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:53,216
Charly.

401
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:02,959
Get away!

402
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:55,245
You've got it,<i> puta.</i>

403
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:13,596
Let go of me.

404
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:21,571
My fucking bat.

405
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:34,784
I got you, I got you brother.

406
00:42:34,786 --> 00:42:37,153
I can't believe
this is happening.

407
00:42:37,155 --> 00:42:39,556
It's all right. I got you.

408
00:42:39,558 --> 00:42:41,791
I'm too young. Too pretty.

409
00:42:45,864 --> 00:42:47,964
- Hey panda.
- Yeah, baby.

410
00:42:47,966 --> 00:42:50,266
Your momma...

411
00:42:50,268 --> 00:42:53,202
She.. No...

412
00:42:53,204 --> 00:42:56,739
She--she said
she was my momma too.

413
00:42:56,741 --> 00:43:01,077
That I was her son
from another brother.

414
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:04,948
- She say...
- You the brother, like no
other.

415
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:10,820
And I... I feel... I feel tired.

416
00:43:10,822 --> 00:43:14,023
Tired.

417
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:40,617
Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ.

418
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:03,973
I do believe the first kill
came rather quickly this year.

419
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:06,776
I'm rather disappointed.

420
00:44:06,778 --> 00:44:12,181
The first one always does.
It's the second one, the
second one has all the drama.

421
00:44:12,183 --> 00:44:17,253
Well, I certainly hope
we see a better showing
from the remaining remnants.

422
00:44:17,255 --> 00:44:21,658
We shall see, we shall see.

423
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:44,213
<i> As we slip into our third our</i>
<i> of non-stop 31 action,</i>

424
00:44:44,215 --> 00:44:48,718

<i> exquisite dining.</i>

425
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:54,123
<i> You may want to try</i>
<i> the steak kidney pie,</i>
<i> followed by the apple crumble.</i>

426
00:44:54,125 --> 00:44:57,427
<i> Mm. Delicious.</i>

427
00:44:57,429 --> 00:45:03,833
<i> For one of you, of course,</i>
<i>this might be your last supper.</i>

428
00:45:06,737 --> 00:45:09,072
Those twisted fuckers.

429
00:45:09,074 --> 00:45:11,307
Fuck.

430
00:45:11,309 --> 00:45:13,876
This is impressive.

431
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:17,880
I hate to admit,
but this layout,

432
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:21,050
oh man, it looks better than
me mother's new year's brunch.

433
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:24,053
Yeah and I assume it's all
laced with rat poisoning.

434
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:26,289
No, I'm relatively
sure it's safe.

435
00:45:26,291 --> 00:45:30,093
Seriously? What could
possibly make you say that?

436
00:45:30,095 --> 00:45:33,096
Because we're
playing their game.

437
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,801
Fuck it. Fuck it, fuck it.

438
00:45:38,803 --> 00:45:43,973
My stomach's so empty,
it's touching me back.

439
00:45:43,975 --> 00:45:47,977
Yeah man.

440
00:45:47,979 --> 00:45:50,079
Are you enjoying that?

441
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:51,147
Yeah man.

442
00:45:58,188 --> 00:46:00,289
I feel it.

443
00:46:00,291 --> 00:46:04,861
I feel all of ya'll lookin' at
me. You're judging. Don't.

444
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:08,297
I isn't made of stone.

445
00:46:12,202 --> 00:46:16,372
Look man. What happened to me
man, levon, back there,

446
00:46:16,374 --> 00:46:19,876
man, it's fucking horrible.

447
00:46:19,878 --> 00:46:23,179
I mean man, he was
my best-est friend
in the whole god damn world.

448
00:46:23,181 --> 00:46:25,181
Panda.

449
00:46:25,183 --> 00:46:29,418
Your best-est friend's blood
is all over my hands.

450
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:35,291
And that's why i
and I gon' stay alive.

451
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:38,528
I don't do it on
an empty stomach.

452
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:41,330
So you, you and you,

453
00:46:41,332 --> 00:46:43,566
I suggest ya'll
do the same thing.

454
00:46:46,904 --> 00:46:48,971
Fuck it.

455
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,045
I take it they're out
watching us, right?

456
00:46:56,047 --> 00:46:58,514
You bet your sweet skunk ass
they're watching.

457
00:46:58,516 --> 00:47:00,516
And listening.

458
00:47:00,518 --> 00:47:02,585
So keep your breathy
thoughts to yourself.

459
00:47:02,587 --> 00:47:06,189
You know, we can do this.
We just have to stay together.

460
00:47:08,525 --> 00:47:09,592
Charly.

461
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:14,096
Charly.

462
00:47:14,098 --> 00:47:15,298
What?

463
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:23,506
What is going on
inside your head?

464
00:47:23,508 --> 00:47:26,309
You want to know what's
going on inside my head?

465
00:47:26,311 --> 00:47:29,612
I'll fucking tell you what's
going on inside my head.

466
00:47:29,614 --> 00:47:33,983
We need better weapons
than this shit.

467
00:47:33,985 --> 00:47:35,618
You're god damn right girly.

468
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:44,160
Hey, anybody remember that story
last year, Halloween,

469
00:47:44,162 --> 00:47:45,928
that church group
that went missing.

470
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:48,397
Yeah I remember hearing
something about that,

471
00:47:48,399 --> 00:47:51,000
just recently on the TV they
found the body of the pastor--

472
00:47:51,002 --> 00:47:53,169
- in the dumpster.
- ...Rotting in dumpster.

473
00:47:53,171 --> 00:47:55,338
- Mm-hmm.
- Holy shit.

474
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:56,372
That's gonna be us.

475
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:57,640
Ah, come on.

476
00:47:57,642 --> 00:47:59,242
No, two second news story.

477
00:47:59,244 --> 00:48:00,977
You know, and we're forgotten.

478
00:48:00,979 --> 00:48:02,011
All right, all right, all right.

479
00:48:02,013 --> 00:48:05,147
Not by me.

480
00:48:05,149 --> 00:48:07,250
Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop eating.

481
00:48:07,252 --> 00:48:09,452
Why, why, what wrong?

482
00:48:12,256 --> 00:48:13,990
Spit it out!

483
00:48:37,648 --> 00:48:40,483
I gotta get the fuck
out of here.

484
00:48:40,485 --> 00:48:42,251
What the fuck?

485
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:44,520
<i> I sincerely hope you all</i>
<i> enjoyed</i>

487
00:48:48,192 --> 00:48:53,095
The first re-assessment of the
standings are as follows:

488
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:56,332
<i> Number one, 50 to 1 odds.</i>

489
00:48:56,334 --> 00:49:00,102
Number three at 90 to 1.

00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:03,339
Number two at 300 to 1.

491
00:49:03,341 --> 00:49:08,945
And, last but not least is
number five, 400 to 1.

492
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:15,451
<i> Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i> boys and girls,</i>
<i> children of all ages,</i>

493
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:18,721
with exactly nine hours
left to play,

494
00:49:18,723 --> 00:49:25,661
<i> I give you, psycho-head and</i>
<i> his brother, the maniacally</i>
<i> mental schizo-head.</i>

495
00:49:27,231 --> 00:49:28,531
There's two of 'em.

496
00:49:28,533 --> 00:49:30,232
Don't scatter.

497
00:49:30,234 --> 00:49:33,302
Oh god damn!

498
00:49:33,304 --> 00:49:36,305
We isn't got a fucking thing to
worry about this year, brother.

499
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:41,310
Look at these sorry sacks
of wasted meat shit.

500
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:43,679
Do we have your attention now,
mother fuckers?

501
00:49:44,682 --> 00:49:47,116
You smell that?

502
00:49:47,118 --> 00:49:49,618
Well I think they're already
pissing in their pants.

503
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:52,722
Oh yeah. Now you think
you got one over

504
00:49:52,724 --> 00:49:55,691
because you took out that little
shot glass bitch sick-head,

505
00:49:55,693 --> 00:49:58,027
well he isn't worth a shit.

506
00:49:58,029 --> 00:50:00,563
The only thing he's good
for is shooting out of
a fucking Cannon.

507
00:50:00,565 --> 00:50:02,631
And I don't see a fucking
Cannon, do you see a fucking
Cannon?

508
00:50:02,633 --> 00:50:04,400
No Cannon.

509
00:50:04,402 --> 00:50:06,769
So that means that
you killed half a man.

510
00:50:06,771 --> 00:50:09,105
And it took five of you

511
00:50:09,107 --> 00:50:11,774
to kill one itty bitty
little baby.

512
00:50:11,776 --> 00:50:14,110
Oh, shit.

513
00:50:14,112 --> 00:50:16,679
Oh, hello ladies.

514
00:50:16,681 --> 00:50:19,648
I am all man and
i am coming for you.

515
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:21,584
Oh we're gonna
fuck all your holes.

516
00:50:23,554 --> 00:50:27,256
Count yourselves lucky,
you got fucked by the best!

517
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:38,667
<i>Eight hours and twelve minutes,</i>

518
00:50:38,669 --> 00:50:42,071
<i> the fun is just beginning.</i>

519
00:50:54,584 --> 00:50:56,552
I don't hear them anymore.

520
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:58,721
- Me neither.
- Listen.

521
00:50:58,723 --> 00:51:00,723
I think we should find a room.

522
00:51:00,725 --> 00:51:04,060
Barricade ourselves in.
Wait it out.

523
00:51:04,062 --> 00:51:05,661
I second the barricade idea.

524
00:51:05,663 --> 00:51:07,530
I'm sick of this
hide-and-seek horse shit.

525
00:51:07,532 --> 00:51:10,166
Got to use your head.

526
00:51:10,168 --> 00:51:12,635
They don't want for us
to be sitting around
all night on our back side.

527
00:51:12,637 --> 00:51:15,271
Okay, okay, hold on.
Charly, we haven't heard you
in the last half an hour,

528
00:51:15,273 --> 00:51:17,440
what do you say, huh?
Your vote counts like mine.

529
00:51:21,678 --> 00:51:24,480
I say we hunt these freaks down
and slit their fucking throats.

530
00:51:25,649 --> 00:51:27,216
All right.

531
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:46,435
<i> Gonna fuck your pussy hole.</i>

532
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:49,805
<i> Gonna fuck that tiny</i>
<i> little brown hole.</i>

533
00:51:49,807 --> 00:51:51,574
<i> And we're gonna fuck</i>
<i> your eye hole too!</i>

534
00:51:51,576 --> 00:51:54,643
<i> A cock in each</i>
<i> motherfuckin' socket.</i>

535
00:51:54,645 --> 00:51:57,346
<i> We're gonna fuck</i>
<i> your mouth hole.</i>

536
00:51:57,348 --> 00:51:59,515
<i> We're gonna fuck</i>
<i> your pussy hole.</i>

537
00:51:59,517 --> 00:52:02,518
<i> We're gonna fuck that tiny</i>
<i> little brown hole.</i>

538
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:05,221
<i> And we're gonna fuck</i>
<i> your eye hole too.</i>

539
00:52:07,125 --> 00:52:08,190
What's that sound?

540
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:13,162
Do you hear it?

541
00:52:13,164 --> 00:52:15,397
It's coming from
the fuck doll.

542
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:21,337
Shh. Shh.

543
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:32,781
That's no fucking doll.

544
00:52:43,426 --> 00:52:46,428
Oh, Jesus Christ, oh god.

545
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:49,265
What the fuck? Panda! Panda!

546
00:52:49,267 --> 00:52:51,467
Don't flip out on me now, man.
Come on.

547
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:56,839
Help me, please.

548
00:52:56,841 --> 00:52:59,775
I need to go home,
everyone is waiting for me.

549
00:52:59,777 --> 00:53:01,744
Oh sweet Jesus.

550
00:53:01,746 --> 00:53:03,179
Help me untie her.

551
00:53:03,181 --> 00:53:05,247
No, no, no, no.

552
00:53:05,249 --> 00:53:06,515
What's your name, honey?

553
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:08,784
Georgina Victor.

554
00:53:08,786 --> 00:53:11,420
- Georgina.
- But my husband calls me
little Georgie.

555
00:53:11,422 --> 00:53:14,657
Hold the fuck up,
hold the fuck up,

556
00:53:14,659 --> 00:53:17,359
- put me the fuck down.
- Panda, what do you think?

557
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:19,328
- Put me the fuck down.
- We don't take the chance on
it.

558
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:21,597
- On letting her run loose.
- She isn't one of them.

559
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:27,703
Look at her. Look at her.

560
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:30,306
She might be somebody's
daughter for all I know.

561
00:53:30,308 --> 00:53:32,641
This is gettin'
crazy around here...

562
00:53:32,643 --> 00:53:34,476
Shut the fuck up.

563
00:53:34,478 --> 00:53:36,312
Panda, shut the fuck up.

564
00:53:36,314 --> 00:53:38,681
He's right,
this is not a good idea.

565
00:53:38,683 --> 00:53:43,452
Please, please,
i know a way out.

566
00:53:43,454 --> 00:53:45,554
- I've heard them talking.
- I believe you.

567
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:47,289
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

568
00:53:48,526 --> 00:53:50,259
Shit, they fucking found us.

569
00:53:50,261 --> 00:53:51,660
We got to secure the door.

570
00:53:51,662 --> 00:53:53,629
I knew it. I fucking knew it.

571
00:53:53,631 --> 00:53:55,965
She sounded the alarm.
She sounded the fucking alarm.

572
00:53:55,967 --> 00:53:58,234
You psycho fucking bitch.

573
00:53:58,236 --> 00:54:01,270
Yeah, I know you.
Tell the house mole.
I know you.

574
00:54:01,272 --> 00:54:02,438
Shut the fuck up, Roscoe.

575
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,706
You don't listen to me.

576
00:54:03,708 --> 00:54:05,507
You do not listen to me.

577
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:08,911
Look at her. Look at her.

578
00:54:08,913 --> 00:54:10,279
Fucking asshole.

579
00:54:10,281 --> 00:54:11,981
You are falling for her.

580
00:54:11,983 --> 00:54:15,784
We've got to get something
to block off the door.

581
00:54:15,786 --> 00:54:17,620
How about one of these pipes?

582
00:54:17,622 --> 00:54:19,455
Look at me, look at me.

583
00:54:19,457 --> 00:54:20,756
Are you fucking going
to help me or not?

584
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:21,824
Look at me.

585
00:54:26,564 --> 00:54:28,564
Oh, fuck.

586
00:54:29,734 --> 00:54:32,501
Fuck!

587
00:54:32,503 --> 00:54:35,471
Bless you. Bless you.

588
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:41,810
I can't get the wires.

589
00:54:41,812 --> 00:54:43,512
It's in her fucking skin.

590
00:54:43,514 --> 00:54:45,447
Rip it out.

591
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:47,049
Think it'll hold?

592
00:54:47,051 --> 00:54:48,017
No.

593
00:54:50,887 --> 00:54:51,987
Get me out of here!

594
00:54:54,557 --> 00:54:55,791
Fuck!

595
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:03,766
I knew it. I knew it.

596
00:55:03,768 --> 00:55:05,467
You fucking bitch.

597
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:07,536
It's a fucking cage.

598
00:55:07,538 --> 00:55:10,539
God damn it!
It's a fucking cage.

599
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:15,544
[Singing maniacally

600
00:55:17,013 --> 00:55:18,847
check the back.

601
00:55:18,849 --> 00:55:20,849
God damn it. I knew it.

602
00:55:20,851 --> 00:55:24,586
I knew it. God damn it.
Nobody listens to me.

603
00:55:36,701 --> 00:55:39,068
Hi there, momma! You miss me?

604
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:53,682
Woo!

605
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:58,454
Look what the fucking
cat drug in.

606
00:55:58,456 --> 00:56:00,356
Two blind mice.

607
00:56:00,358 --> 00:56:02,725
See how they're dumb.

608
00:56:02,727 --> 00:56:05,661
Even the fucking mice know
how to get out of the maze,
motherfuckers.

609
00:56:12,902 --> 00:56:14,937
Looks like I need
a new fuck bag.

610
00:56:14,939 --> 00:56:19,408
And after I get done
with pork chop, you're after.

611
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:21,443
You gotta go through
me before her..

612
00:56:21,445 --> 00:56:23,679
You're gonna be my fuck bag.
Come on, bring it.

613
00:56:23,681 --> 00:56:25,881
All that chivalry is worthless,
motherfucker.

614
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:26,949
Like tits on a boar hog.

615
00:56:26,951 --> 00:56:28,684
Come on, bitch!

616
00:56:28,686 --> 00:56:30,886
Meet Mr. fucking dick head,
sideburns.

617
00:56:38,995 --> 00:56:40,028
Panda!

618
00:57:18,134 --> 00:57:20,169
Oh, you fucking bitch.

619
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:24,907
You do like to make it happen,
don't you, bitch?

620
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:37,152
No, I'll never fucking die!

621
00:58:11,121 --> 00:58:13,088
I don't want to die.

622
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:17,593
I don't want to be here,
they make me be here.

623
00:58:17,595 --> 00:58:20,629
We're all pawns
in this stupid game.

624
00:58:20,631 --> 00:58:23,198
We don't want to...

625
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:26,668
You and me, we're the same.

626
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:30,038
We're the same, brother.

627
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:34,543
Okay, brother.

628
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:10,946
That thing's gonna
come in handy.

629
00:59:20,591 --> 00:59:22,824
All right Roscoe, I got you,
i got you.

630
00:59:22,826 --> 00:59:24,960
Let's get out of here before
that damn thing slams shut
again.

631
00:59:24,962 --> 00:59:29,164
Charly, pick up that
other chainsaw.

632
00:59:29,166 --> 00:59:30,666
Fucking chain snapped.

633
00:59:30,668 --> 00:59:31,867
Leave it!

634
00:59:31,869 --> 00:59:33,902
Fuck.

635
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:36,338
Seven hours and three minutes.

636
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:41,743
Ah, I believe it's time to
recalculate the odds.

637
00:59:41,745 --> 00:59:45,213
Prepare to open your purses.

638
00:59:51,655 --> 00:59:53,889
Oh, shit.

639
00:59:58,127 --> 00:59:59,995
How fucked am I?

640
00:59:59,997 --> 01:00:02,030
I don't know, man.
It looks pretty bad.

641
01:00:02,032 --> 01:00:04,900
Yeah, it feels pretty bad.

642
01:00:04,902 --> 01:00:08,637
You've got to get this
tight enough to keep it shut.

643
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:12,107
What's that thing you say to
the kids coming out of
the spook house in tears?

644
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:15,043
- Why?
- Just tell me.

645
01:00:15,045 --> 01:00:20,382
Crying is for pussies,
so go grow a pair, you big baby.

646
01:00:20,384 --> 01:00:22,918
Get ready to grow a pair,
you big baby.

647
01:00:25,356 --> 01:00:26,989
God.

648
01:00:33,863 --> 01:00:36,865
<i> Attention, attention.</i>

649
01:00:36,867 --> 01:00:40,035
<i> Number one, odds 40 to 1.</i>

650
01:00:40,037 --> 01:00:42,704
<i> Number two, odds 300 to 1.</i>

651
01:00:42,706 --> 01:00:46,642
Number three, 1 million to 1.

652
01:00:46,644 --> 01:00:49,945
Ah, fuck.

653
01:00:49,947 --> 01:00:54,082
<i> 5, odds, 300 to one.</i>

654
01:00:54,084 --> 01:00:58,186
Sex and death are on their way.

655
01:01:49,772 --> 01:01:51,740
What the fuck is going on.

656
01:01:53,776 --> 01:01:55,744
You see anything?

657
01:01:55,746 --> 01:01:59,381
All I see is a bunch of nothing.

658
01:01:59,383 --> 01:02:02,317
It seems crazy.

659
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:04,753
Waiting here to be attacked.

660
01:02:04,755 --> 01:02:07,823
Running around with
our heads cut off.

661
01:02:07,825 --> 01:02:10,092
Only gets us a chance
to get our heads cut off.

662
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:16,164
Get the others.

663
01:02:21,204 --> 01:02:24,106
Come with me. Just go with them.

664
01:02:24,108 --> 01:02:26,174
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hey, hey.

665
01:02:26,176 --> 01:02:27,442
- Come on. What are
you talking about?
- Stay here, stay here.

666
01:02:27,444 --> 01:02:29,177
Be right back.

667
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:38,186
Who would wear a green tutu
but that guy?

668
01:02:38,188 --> 01:02:41,923
All right my best play
is I circle around

669
01:02:41,925 --> 01:02:43,992
go cut them from the back side.

670
01:02:43,994 --> 01:02:45,327
Now once I'm in place,

671
01:02:45,329 --> 01:02:47,496
ya'll create a distraction.

672
01:02:47,498 --> 01:02:50,365
Only gon' get one shot.
So you got to make it proper.

673
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,967
Mm-hmm.

674
01:02:55,071 --> 01:03:00,041
Death has come to sing
its quiet song.

675
01:03:00,043 --> 01:03:04,179
How they hide,
for it won't be long.

676
01:03:04,181 --> 01:03:09,050
Death strikes once,
and then it's gone!

677
01:03:10,553 --> 01:03:14,422
Where are you little
fucking cunts?

678
01:03:14,424 --> 01:03:16,291
I want to see you.

679
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:28,870
Fuck if I'm going to
fucking stay here.

680
01:03:36,579 --> 01:03:38,947
Come on!

681
01:03:38,949 --> 01:03:40,882
We're right here.

682
01:03:40,884 --> 01:03:42,450
Come on and come and get it.

683
01:03:45,355 --> 01:03:47,823
Panda, they hear you.
Behind you.

684
01:04:14,483 --> 01:04:17,919
Oh how nice, the women
are here to save the day.

685
01:04:17,921 --> 01:04:19,020
Come on.

686
01:04:19,022 --> 01:04:20,388
Come ladies, come here.

687
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:22,390
- Panda, panda.
- Come, come on.

688
01:04:22,392 --> 01:04:24,292
I want to fuck you.

689
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,934
I'm so scared.

690
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:46,147
Hi.

691
01:04:54,123 --> 01:04:59,494
Oh, great white hunter,
what am I going to do with you?

692
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:04,366
Would you like a
lick of my lolly?

693
01:05:09,005 --> 01:05:10,939
I remember you.

694
01:05:10,941 --> 01:05:13,308
I'm so flattered
you remember me.

695
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:18,213
Is it huntin' time now?

696
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:25,020
Or how about now?

697
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:36,197
Don't worry, popeye,
it's always someone's fault.

698
01:05:36,199 --> 01:05:39,634
Come here, bitch.
Come and get me.

699
01:05:39,636 --> 01:05:44,205
Well I am kind of high
from eating all my spinach.

700
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:50,145
I guess maybe I should really
put you out of your misery.

701
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:57,352
Ah, fuck!

702
01:06:00,991 --> 01:06:03,091
[Both struggling
bitch!

703
01:07:12,294 --> 01:07:13,728
Fuck you.

704
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:15,697
Motherfucker, come on.

705
01:07:24,141 --> 01:07:26,808
I can feel your fear.

706
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:30,412
It's like a strange smell.

707
01:07:30,414 --> 01:07:31,513
Hey!

708
01:07:31,515 --> 01:07:33,314
- Scat!
- Hey

709
01:07:41,157 --> 01:07:45,060
you want her? Then back off, or
I'll slit her fucking throat.

710
01:07:46,530 --> 01:07:49,264
No, no, no, don't, don't, don't.

711
01:07:49,266 --> 01:07:50,598
Don't hurt her.

712
01:07:51,735 --> 01:07:53,635
Don't, don't that.

713
01:08:02,144 --> 01:08:05,213
You can kill me...

714
01:08:05,215 --> 01:08:07,148
Venus!

715
01:08:09,652 --> 01:08:12,187
Baby, no!

716
01:08:13,622 --> 01:08:15,757
No!

717
01:08:21,431 --> 01:08:22,797
Baby! No!

718
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:24,499
What are you waiting for?

719
01:08:24,501 --> 01:08:26,301
We can't.

720
01:08:26,303 --> 01:08:28,369
Do it. Do it.

721
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:33,341
No! No!

722
01:08:35,144 --> 01:08:36,845
What do you want to do
with her, charly?

723
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:58,600
What is the next step?

724
01:08:58,602 --> 01:09:03,838
We must calculate the next step
very carefully.

725
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:06,441
Death-head was our safety net.

726
01:09:06,443 --> 01:09:09,677
But since he has expired...

727
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:12,814
Could I suggest bash-head?

728
01:09:12,816 --> 01:09:15,850
He can't be trusted to
close the deal properly, no.

729
01:09:15,852 --> 01:09:17,352
Fuck you, bitch.

730
01:09:17,354 --> 01:09:19,420
Maybe rage-head.

731
01:09:19,422 --> 01:09:20,889
Too irrational.

732
01:09:20,891 --> 01:09:23,391
Oh fuck.

733
01:09:23,393 --> 01:09:29,464
I believe there is only
one logical and still
compelling choice.

734
01:09:29,466 --> 01:09:31,933
Oh yeah, woo!

735
01:09:31,935 --> 01:09:34,169
Doom-head.

736
01:09:34,171 --> 01:09:36,471
Oh fuck, oh fuck. Bitch.

737
01:09:36,473 --> 01:09:38,740
Are we in agreement
on that decision?

738
01:09:38,742 --> 01:09:40,608
Agreed.

739
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:42,710
Oh fucking yeah.

740
01:09:42,712 --> 01:09:44,479
It is doom-head.

741
01:09:44,481 --> 01:09:47,182
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

742
01:09:47,184 --> 01:09:49,584
Who's going to make the call?

743
01:09:49,586 --> 01:09:51,719
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

744
01:09:51,721 --> 01:09:53,922
- Oh yeah, oh yeah.

745
01:09:53,924 --> 01:09:58,426
- Fuck.
- Don't answer that.
Don't answer it.

746
01:09:58,428 --> 01:10:00,228
It can wait, don't answer it.

747
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:02,630
Fuck, don't stop now.

748
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,501
This is business.

749
01:10:08,938 --> 01:10:11,839
Yeah?

750
01:10:11,841 --> 01:10:17,378
Thing is, I really wasn't
planning on working this year.

751
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:24,252
Right now, I got a pretty decent
piece of pussy with a big 'ol
ass spread right in front of me.

752
01:10:24,254 --> 01:10:29,490
Uh-huh. Double last year's fee.

753
01:10:29,492 --> 01:10:33,428
Done. I'll be
there in 90 minutes.

754
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:35,563
What's that?

755
01:10:35,565 --> 01:10:36,965
Fuck off.

756
01:10:36,967 --> 01:10:39,901
Who was it baby?

757
01:10:41,905 --> 01:10:45,240
That, believe it or not,

758
01:10:45,242 --> 01:10:50,378
was Mr.
none-of-your-fucking-business.

759
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:53,248
Yeah well what the fuck am
i supposed to do?

760
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:58,319
Well, you can stick your fingers
in your dripping twat

761
01:10:58,321 --> 01:11:02,590
and finish yourself off
or get the fuck out.

762
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:04,692
Frankly my dear,
i don't give a damn.

763
01:11:04,694 --> 01:11:06,561
You know,
you're pretty full of yourself,

764
01:11:06,563 --> 01:11:10,698
nobody messes with Mr. big shot,
well fuck you.

765
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:15,370
Bitch, you run a perfect game
day after day,

766
01:11:15,372 --> 01:11:18,640
isn't luck hun, skill.

767
01:11:18,642 --> 01:11:20,775
Can I at least take
a shower before I go?

768
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:22,944
Negative.

769
01:11:22,946 --> 01:11:26,381
Take that sticking ass
and hit the bricks.

770
01:11:58,882 --> 01:12:01,482
Do you hear that?

771
01:12:06,055 --> 01:12:08,022
God I love that song.

772
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:16,631
Shit. I wish
i was in California.

773
01:12:49,565 --> 01:12:51,699
What am I working with?

774
01:12:51,701 --> 01:12:54,469
Four hours
and thirty-seven minutes.

775
01:12:54,471 --> 01:12:56,704
I can kill your whole family
in that amount of time.

776
01:14:13,148 --> 01:14:15,216
<i> I'm not crazy, I'm in control.</i>

777
01:14:15,218 --> 01:14:17,885
<i> I'm not crazy, I'm in control.</i>

778
01:14:17,887 --> 01:14:20,154
I'm not crazy, I'm in control.

779
01:14:20,156 --> 01:14:22,690
I'm not crazy, I'm in control.

780
01:14:22,692 --> 01:14:25,193
I'm not crazy, I'm in control.

781
01:14:25,195 --> 01:14:26,928
I'm not crazy, fuck!

782
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:33,734
Fuck!

783
01:15:01,029 --> 01:15:02,129
Gentlemen.

784
01:15:04,566 --> 01:15:09,070
Take the rest of the night off.
I'll handle it from here.

785
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:15,676
Murder school,
well it's now in session.

786
01:15:33,729 --> 01:15:35,930
Hey, bitch.

787
01:15:35,932 --> 01:15:39,166
Now did you really think
cutting my head off was
going to keep me down?

788
01:15:39,168 --> 01:15:43,871
Oh, I got that motherfucker
sewn back on pronto
and I am feeling groovy.

789
01:15:45,775 --> 01:15:49,243
You see, we isn't
human around here. No, no, no.

790
01:15:49,245 --> 01:15:51,879
Ain't you learned shit yet?

791
01:15:51,881 --> 01:15:56,017
Hey brother, looky over here.

792
01:15:56,019 --> 01:15:58,119
You want to see something
mad funny?

793
01:15:59,788 --> 01:16:02,723
Hey there number five.

794
01:16:02,725 --> 01:16:05,159
Welcome to the party.

795
01:16:05,161 --> 01:16:07,695
Here's your first question.

796
01:16:07,697 --> 01:16:11,866
What's sicker than fucking
a pregnant bitch?

797
01:16:11,868 --> 01:16:14,001
- Oh, gee.
- I don't know.

798
01:16:14,003 --> 01:16:18,873
What is sicker than
fucking a pregnant bitch?

799
01:16:18,875 --> 01:16:21,976
Getting a blowjob from the baby.

800
01:16:25,281 --> 01:16:28,049
- Do another one, man.
- All right, all right.

801
01:16:28,051 --> 01:16:30,785
Next one, number five.

802
01:16:30,787 --> 01:16:36,891
What is the difference between
an onion and a whore?

803
01:16:36,893 --> 01:16:40,094
Oh shucks, I don't know.

804
01:16:40,096 --> 01:16:43,898
Though I should,
'cause I am a whore.
What is it?

805
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:46,067
W-w-w-wait, I know this one.

806
01:16:46,069 --> 01:16:47,335
Let me do it, let me do it.

807
01:16:47,337 --> 01:16:48,903
All right brother, you go ahead.

808
01:16:50,707 --> 01:16:55,242
The difference between
an onion and a whore is

809
01:16:55,244 --> 01:16:57,878
I cry when I cut onions!

810
01:16:59,247 --> 01:17:01,649
It's okay, it's okay.

811
01:17:02,985 --> 01:17:05,353
It's okay, shh.

812
01:17:07,223 --> 01:17:09,323
It's okay.

813
01:17:16,264 --> 01:17:18,866
It's all right.

814
01:17:18,868 --> 01:17:20,635
Roscoe.

815
01:17:25,774 --> 01:17:32,046
I had the worst nightmare.

816
01:17:32,048 --> 01:17:39,053
How can a nightmare be
any worse than this reality?

817
01:17:39,055 --> 01:17:40,087
It can't.

818
01:17:44,359 --> 01:17:47,028
How long was I asleep?

819
01:17:47,030 --> 01:17:52,733
I don't know.
At this point I don't know...

820
01:17:52,735 --> 01:17:54,335
If it's a minute or an hour.

821
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:58,172
Where's charly?

822
01:17:58,174 --> 01:18:00,007
Hey did--

823
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:02,076
where's charly?

824
01:18:02,078 --> 01:18:04,111
She--she went down the hall
to see what she could find.

825
01:18:04,113 --> 01:18:06,714
You let her go out on her own?

826
01:18:06,716 --> 01:18:08,215
Like I was going to stop her?

827
01:18:10,318 --> 01:18:13,220
You idiot. An idiot.

828
01:18:13,222 --> 01:18:16,257
She, hey, she specifically
said for you to stay here.

829
01:18:16,259 --> 01:18:18,726
Well, that's not
going to happen.

830
01:18:18,728 --> 01:18:20,695
Come on, Venus.

831
01:18:20,697 --> 01:18:22,463
Give me a fucking break.

832
01:18:34,409 --> 01:18:40,948
Excuse me for asking father, but
what exactly is the protocol if
we have a survivor?

833
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:43,284
Doom-head has never failed us.

834
01:18:43,286 --> 01:18:46,353
He will deliver, as expected.

835
01:18:46,355 --> 01:18:50,491
I mean no disrespect,
but that was not the question.

836
01:18:56,031 --> 01:18:59,200
I suggest you make sure your
final wagers are in order.

837
01:18:59,202 --> 01:19:01,135
Lovely thank you,
darling, thank you.

838
01:19:01,137 --> 01:19:04,171
Lovely, lovely, lovely.

839
01:19:04,173 --> 01:19:07,408
Right, my wager.

840
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:09,410
Five million.

841
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:15,483
I respectfully decline.
I am out.

842
01:19:15,485 --> 01:19:19,754
Oh, of course you are.
Playing with the big boys
isn't everyone's cup of tea.

843
01:19:24,059 --> 01:19:25,793
I will take that bet.

844
01:19:31,133 --> 01:19:33,033
And double it.

845
01:19:36,371 --> 01:19:41,876
All right, now we have ourselves
a game. So let us continue.

846
01:20:43,872 --> 01:20:45,272
You smell that?

847
01:20:47,577 --> 01:20:49,977
Go on, smell it.

848
01:20:49,979 --> 01:20:54,281
I didn't yank my crusty old dong
out of some whore's asshole

849
01:20:54,283 --> 01:20:57,284
for a quickie wham, bam,
thank you ma'am,

850
01:20:57,286 --> 01:21:02,022
I came to get down and dirty,
oh yeah.

851
01:21:05,093 --> 01:21:08,262
Please...

852
01:21:08,264 --> 01:21:10,030
Let them live.

853
01:21:10,032 --> 01:21:11,966
What is it about me
that gives you

854
01:21:11,968 --> 01:21:14,268
some impression that
i would spare them?

855
01:21:14,270 --> 01:21:17,137
Huh? Huh?

856
01:21:17,139 --> 01:21:21,008
'Cause if that's the case then
i really got to work on my
person to person demeanor.

857
01:21:23,579 --> 01:21:29,884
Unfortunately, those other
fools and idiots gave you
the most worthless feeling.

858
01:21:29,886 --> 01:21:33,187
And that feeling is hope.

859
01:21:33,189 --> 01:21:39,360
The unicorn alive
shitting the magic rainbow,
it's but an illusion.

860
01:21:39,362 --> 01:21:46,200
Life is nothing but the
stinking filthy boneyard
of dead rotting tramps, huh?

861
01:22:16,097 --> 01:22:19,600
Did you see Venus?

862
01:22:19,602 --> 01:22:21,235
What are you talking about, man,
i left her here with you.

863
01:22:21,237 --> 01:22:23,671
Fuck me.

864
01:22:23,673 --> 01:22:26,273
<i> Attention, attention.</i>

865
01:22:26,275 --> 01:22:32,146
<i> Three hours and four minutes,</i>
<i> oh, how time flies.</i>

866
01:23:26,735 --> 01:23:31,138
Victorious warriors win first
then go to war.

867
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:36,143
While defeated warriors,
they go to war first
then seek to win.

868
01:23:37,345 --> 01:23:38,779
Which are you?

869
01:23:41,383 --> 01:23:44,251
I'm a gentle man of war.

870
01:23:44,253 --> 01:23:48,756
So I'll give you a moment of
peace and tranquility with your
fallen comrade.

871
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:54,695
Oh, by the way,

872
01:23:54,697 --> 01:23:57,765
the doors to the outside
world are now officially open.

873
01:23:59,501 --> 01:24:02,169
Feel free to
wander the grounds.

874
01:24:24,659 --> 01:24:27,428
Come on, let's go.

875
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:37,237
It's a fucking dead end.
A goddamn dead end.

876
01:24:37,239 --> 01:24:39,239
Damn.

877
01:24:40,508 --> 01:24:42,242
- Oh.
- What's this?

878
01:24:42,244 --> 01:24:46,080
This, this, this.
This is fucking it.

879
01:24:46,082 --> 01:24:48,282
Help me, help me. This is it.

880
01:24:49,585 --> 01:24:52,519
- Come on.
- It's rising.

881
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:56,256
Come on. Help me.

882
01:25:05,834 --> 01:25:07,367
What do you think?

883
01:25:07,369 --> 01:25:08,569
It's your best chance.

884
01:25:08,571 --> 01:25:10,370
You mean our best chance.

885
01:25:10,372 --> 01:25:13,107
No, I don't,
i can't get down there.

886
01:25:13,109 --> 01:25:15,542
After everything this
is where you bail on me?

887
01:25:15,544 --> 01:25:17,811
No, this shit isn't over.

888
01:25:17,813 --> 01:25:20,447
I can't get down there. I can't.

889
01:25:20,449 --> 01:25:21,682
You can.

890
01:25:23,585 --> 01:25:26,787
Oh fuck, he's coming.
Get in there.

891
01:25:29,190 --> 01:25:30,858
I'll hold him off as
long as I can.

892
01:25:30,860 --> 01:25:31,859
Wait, I'm not leaving.

893
01:25:31,861 --> 01:25:33,327
Fucking go.

894
01:25:33,329 --> 01:25:34,428
I'm not leaving without you.

895
01:25:34,430 --> 01:25:35,729
Get the fuck down there.

896
01:25:35,731 --> 01:25:36,897
Shut the fuck up.

897
01:25:36,899 --> 01:25:38,298
Get the fuck in there.

898
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:39,800
Stupid bitch get in there.

899
01:25:39,802 --> 01:25:41,168
Shut the fuck up
and get down there.

900
01:25:41,170 --> 01:25:42,569
Get the fuck in there.

901
01:25:49,444 --> 01:25:50,878
At least I get to die
in the fresh air.

902
01:25:53,214 --> 01:25:55,482
Hey fuck head!

903
01:25:55,484 --> 01:25:57,184
Get over here!

904
01:25:59,287 --> 01:26:01,655
Get the fuck over here,
fuck head!

905
01:26:05,326 --> 01:26:07,294
You trying to fight me
or fuck me?

906
01:30:06,801 --> 01:30:08,869
Fuck.

907
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:15,909
Number five...

908
01:30:15,911 --> 01:30:16,877
Boo.

909
01:30:26,421 --> 01:30:30,023
In moments of great
accomplishment such as this,

910
01:30:32,059 --> 01:30:35,529
I feel the need to celebrate.

911
01:30:35,531 --> 01:30:42,002
I found that the best of times
happens exactly at the point we
lose track of them. Hmm?

912
01:30:42,004 --> 01:30:46,940
We must train ourselves
to extend the moment
and learn to live.

913
01:31:01,856 --> 01:31:07,594
Smoke in times of rest
is a great companion
to the solitary soldier.

914
01:31:07,596 --> 01:31:10,831
You know who said that?

915
01:31:10,833 --> 01:31:13,967
Huh?

916
01:31:13,969 --> 01:31:17,003
Do you know said that?

917
01:31:34,689 --> 01:31:37,557
Do you really think
i give a fuck?

918
01:31:42,965 --> 01:31:47,901
It was everyone's favorite
revolutionary marxist,
che Guevara.

919
01:31:47,903 --> 01:31:53,607
Except, I think
he smoked a pipe.

920
01:31:53,609 --> 01:31:57,577
I always thought I'd appear
rather pretentious with a pipe.

921
01:31:59,914 --> 01:32:03,884
Look in to the eyes
of a true champion.

922
01:32:07,154 --> 01:32:09,122
Look.

923
01:32:09,124 --> 01:32:14,094
Huh? Look in to the eyes
of a true champion.

924
01:32:14,096 --> 01:32:17,197
Look in to the eyes
of a true champion.

925
01:32:19,867 --> 01:32:22,536
Look in to the eyes
of a true champion.

926
01:32:22,538 --> 01:32:26,273
Look in to the eyes
of a true champion.

927
01:32:38,719 --> 01:32:41,721
- Aww, shh...

928
01:32:41,723 --> 01:32:44,624
That's a good girl.

929
01:32:44,626 --> 01:32:47,894
It's all okay.

930
01:32:47,896 --> 01:32:53,133
Shh.

931
01:32:53,135 --> 01:32:55,769
Catch your breath.

932
01:32:55,771 --> 01:33:00,240
Catch your breath, it's okay.

933
01:33:00,242 --> 01:33:02,776
It's okay.

934
01:33:02,778 --> 01:33:05,011
There you go.

935
01:33:05,013 --> 01:33:08,081
Relax, little girl.

936
01:33:12,620 --> 01:33:14,287
Well, well, well,

937
01:33:14,289 --> 01:33:17,157
shall we do this
white chapel style, then?

938
01:33:20,661 --> 01:33:25,198
Bloody red tears,
my dear Mary Kelly.

939
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:29,369
I have to say I do respect you.

940
01:33:29,371 --> 01:33:34,274
But, um, it's time to die.

941
01:33:36,377 --> 01:33:41,615
<i> Weapons down. Weapons down.</i>

942
01:33:41,617 --> 01:33:43,917
Motherfucker!

943
01:33:43,919 --> 01:33:48,955
<i> 31 has come to an end.</i>

944
01:33:48,957 --> 01:33:52,392
You lucky fucking
dirty little cunt.

945
01:34:23,424 --> 01:34:28,194
<i> It seems the unthinkable</i>
<i> has happened.</i>

946
01:34:28,196 --> 01:34:30,664
<i> We have a winner.</i>

947
01:34:30,666 --> 01:34:35,168
<i> What exactly will</i>
<i> you do with her?</i>

948
01:34:35,170 --> 01:34:39,139
<i> I'm going to have to get</i>
<i> back to you on that one.</i>

949
01:34:39,141 --> 01:34:43,343
<i> Thank you for another</i>
<i> exciting year of 31.</i>
