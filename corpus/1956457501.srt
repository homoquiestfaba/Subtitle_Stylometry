916

Let me try and explain it

941
00:52:43,361 --> 00:52:45,227
Suicide Mission.

942
00:52:45,229 --> 00:52:48,397
Earl and I did the math
the second we got these orders.

943
00:52:48,399 --> 00:52:50,533
- Gentlemen, clear the room.

944
00:53:00,478 --> 00:53:02,545
Commander McClusky,
is there a problem?

945
00:53:02,547 --> 00:53:04,280
- They're objecting
to the mission, sir.

946
00:53:04,282 --> 00:53:06,482
Apparently,
a heavily damaged carrier

947
00:53:06,484 --> 00:53:07,883
with no ability
to launch aircraft

948
00:53:07,885 --> 00:53:09,518
is proving to be
a formidable foe.

949
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,220
- Maybe so,

950
00:53:11,222 --> 00:53:13,522
but I believe I was asking
Commander McClusky.

951
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:17,226
He has us flying 240 miles
to the target

952
00:53:17,228 --> 00:53:18,861
with thousand-pound bombs.

953
00:53:18,863 --> 00:53:20,729
- The ordinance is to assure
destruction of the target.

954
00:53:20,731 --> 00:53:22,631
- Lugging a thousand pounder
that far,

955
00:53:22,633 --> 00:53:25,267
you're sentencing those men
to ditch in the sea.

956
00:53:25,269 --> 00:53:27,369
We don't have enough gas
to get home.

957
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:29,305
- Per the specs
of the Dauntless,

958
00:53:29,307 --> 00:53:31,340
you'll have enough fuel
to complete the mission.

959
00:53:31,342 --> 00:53:34,243
- Sure, if the carrier
sits there quietly

960
00:53:34,245 --> 00:53:35,911
and allow us
to slowly fly up,

961
00:53:35,913 --> 00:53:37,646
drop our payload,

962
00:53:37,648 --> 00:53:39,715
and slowly fly away,

963
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:41,750
but what the hell
are the chances of that?

964
00:53:43,554 --> 00:53:45,321
- Commander McClusky
and the pilots

965
00:53:45,323 --> 00:53:46,989
know the planes
better than anyone.

966
00:53:46,991 --> 00:53:50,626
And I'm as eager as the next guy
to sink another carrier,

967
00:53:50,628 --> 00:53:54,463
but not at the expense
of more men in the water.

968
00:53:54,465 --> 00:53:56,265
Will you work the plan?

969
00:53:56,267 --> 00:53:59,435
Allow the planes
to land on the deck,

970
00:53:59,437 --> 00:54:01,470

971
00:54:04,008 --> 00:54:05,307
