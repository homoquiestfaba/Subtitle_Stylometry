2
00:00:59,792 --> 00:01:01,020
Uh... oh, no.

3
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,621
I suppose there's one
in every group, one oddball...

4
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:05,653
- who never fits in.
- Let's go get him.

5
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:06,687
- Come on!
- Yeah.

6
00:01:06,732 --> 00:01:08,131
Well, that was me...

7
00:01:08,167 --> 00:01:10,294
- Aah!
- David Gordon.

8
00:01:11,203 --> 00:01:13,797
I found my escape
through my stories.

9
00:01:14,473 --> 00:01:17,033
My imagination was a...
was like a rocket ship...

10
00:01:17,076 --> 00:01:18,873
that took me far away
where I could look at life...

11
00:01:18,911 --> 00:01:20,173
from a safe distance...

12
00:01:20,212 --> 00:01:23,613
which, I guess, is what l...
I now do in my books.

13
00:01:23,649 --> 00:01:25,207
As unlucky
as I was in childhood...

14
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:29,551
I was very, very lucky
as a writer.

15
00:01:30,456 --> 00:01:34,790
Um, so instead of becoming a
well-adjusted, normal person...

16
00:01:34,827 --> 00:01:38,126
I became a kind of a deranged,
successful person.

17
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:40,894
And I'm not sure
which is preferable...

18
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:42,730
but it doesn't really matter
'cause you don't get to choose.

19
00:01:42,768 --> 00:01:45,066
But to answer your original
question more directly...

20
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:46,833
yes, I do believe
that in every work of fiction...

21
00:01:46,872 --> 00:01:48,931
there is one character that,
for the author...

22
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:50,772
is in some ways
autobiographical...

23
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:54,473
<i>and that certainly holds true
for Dracoban.</i>

24
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:56,804
You know, like in a dream...

25
00:01:56,849 --> 00:02:00,182
one character, um,
usually represents you...

26
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,418
but in this case,
it's not who you expect...

27
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:07,051
um, because, you see,
I'm not the human.

28
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:11,391
I'm the creature.

29
00:02:15,534 --> 00:02:17,195
Is that good?

30
00:02:30,983 --> 00:02:32,041
David.

31
00:02:33,886 --> 00:02:34,978
Hey, Harlee.

32
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:39,748
Thought I might see you
here today.

33
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,692
Yeah. I thought
I might see you, too.

34
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,036
Sweet of you to come.

35
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:55,802
Yeah, I think...
I think we spent...

36
00:02:55,841 --> 00:02:58,935
almost every single birthday
together since the third grade.

37
00:03:00,746 --> 00:03:01,770
Hi, Somewhere.

38
00:03:03,115 --> 00:03:05,174
Somewhere's happy to see you.

39
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,714
So what do you think, honestly?

40
00:03:08,754 --> 00:03:09,812
Are you kidding?

41
00:03:09,855 --> 00:03:11,823
I love the idea
of you adopting a child.

42
00:03:11,857 --> 00:03:12,949
I think it's so beautiful...

43
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:14,789
for you to open up
your heart like that.

44
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:16,192
Liz thinks I'm crazy, you know?

45
00:03:16,228 --> 00:03:17,752
I mean, what if she's right,
you know?

46
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:19,389
What if I'm...
What if I'm not up to it?

47
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:20,456
Let me tell you something.

48
00:03:20,499 --> 00:03:23,093
My mother raised five kids,
and never, for one second...

49
00:03:23,135 --> 00:03:25,501
did she question whether she
was cut out to be a parent.

50
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,527
And she was great, right?

51
00:03:26,572 --> 00:03:28,301
No, the worst.

52
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,932
Her shrink has a house
in Laguna because of her.

53
00:03:29,975 --> 00:03:31,374
Oh.

54
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:34,174
Just the fact that you're even
asking yourself the question...

55
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:36,204
pretty much proves
you're qualified.

56
00:03:36,248 --> 00:03:38,307
Most people spend
more time worrying about...

57
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,750
how to raise tomatoes
than they do their own kids.

58
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:45,655
You even imagine how happy
Mary would be about this?

59
00:03:46,992 --> 00:03:48,755
Yeah, but that's not
a good enough reason to do it.

60
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:54,059
You've got a lot of love
left in your heart.

61
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:56,802
You better come back here!

62
00:03:56,802 --> 00:03:57,530
You better come back here!

63
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,612
Hi, David. Hi.

64
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:17,354
Hi, Sophie.
It's been a long time.

65
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:19,254
Yeah, yeah, been a few years.

66
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:20,280
You look well.

67
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:21,987
Thanks. You, too.

68
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:25,555
Come on, throw the ball!

69
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,599
Just not ready to commit
to something like this.

70
00:04:33,472 --> 00:04:35,167
I'm sorry.

71
00:04:35,207 --> 00:04:37,072
Didn't you know I was gonna
ask you something like this?

72
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,378
Didn't want to say no
over the phone.

73
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,437
Right.

74
00:04:43,482 --> 00:04:44,540
It didn't seem right.

75
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,975
I'm really sorry.

76
00:04:50,956 --> 00:04:52,617
When girls go shopping...

77
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:58,788
Hi.

78
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:00,025
What's your name?

79
00:05:00,065 --> 00:05:01,054
Esther.

80
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,658
Hi, Esther.

81
00:05:02,701 --> 00:05:04,464
I know who you are.

82
00:05:04,503 --> 00:05:05,629
You do?

83
00:05:05,671 --> 00:05:07,935
You're the man who Sophie
called about Dennis...

84
00:05:07,973 --> 00:05:11,534
but you don't want him
'cause your wife's dead.

85
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:12,601
Who told you that?

86
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:13,942
Dennis.

87
00:05:17,516 --> 00:05:19,882
Are you a friend of his,
or what?

88
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,410
No. He's a weirdo.

89
00:05:22,454 --> 00:05:24,786
He doesn't have any friends.

90
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:25,984
He doesn't?

91
00:05:27,893 --> 00:05:29,451
Where is he hangin' out?

92
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,097
He's in the box.

93
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,558
He doesn't come out until night.

94
00:05:38,003 --> 00:05:39,994
Why does he do that?

95
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:43,099
The sun. He hates the sun.

96
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:44,268
Why does he hate the sun?

97
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:47,074
I don't know. Because
he thinks it's too sunny?

98
00:05:47,746 --> 00:05:49,043
Right.

99
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,880
I told him you were weird.

100
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:00,115
He is in the box.

101
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:09,159
Oh! Man! Ooh!

102
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:10,190
But I don't understand...

103
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:11,828
why did she call you
in the first place?

104
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,702
Well, she thought she had
found a good match for us.

105
00:06:13,739 --> 00:06:16,003
Aren't, like, single men like
the bottom of the totem pole?

106
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,941
Hey, I am not a single man.

107
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:19,842
I am a widower...

108
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,245
and that is
the worst of all worlds.

109
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:25,273
I am in the ground
below the totem pole.

110
00:06:25,317 --> 00:06:26,784
Oh, wow, you know what?

111
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,343
I think it was
really insensitive of her...

112
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:29,376
to call in the first place.

113
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:30,445
I mean,
it's only been two years.

114
00:06:30,489 --> 00:06:32,184
- Oh! Oh!
- Hey!

115
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:35,086
- Guys, get off the dog.
- We're just playing.

116
00:06:35,127 --> 00:06:36,151
- Yeah.
- Oh!

117
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:39,392
That dog is like
200 years old in human...

118
00:06:39,431 --> 00:06:41,524
Would you do that to Grandma?

119
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,865
Guys, get off!

120
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,666
They drive me nuts,
and they're mine.

121
00:06:45,704 --> 00:06:48,002
I mean, I don't know why
Mary even wanted to adopt.

122
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,065
Well, she was adopted herself
and, you know...

123
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,134
Yeah, but it was something
you were gonna do together...

124
00:06:52,177 --> 00:06:53,166
- and, you know.
- Yeah. Yeah.

125
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:54,474
But, hey, it's not gonna happen.

126
00:06:54,513 --> 00:06:55,844
You're like preaching
to the converted.

127
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:56,939
Okay. Good...

128
00:06:56,982 --> 00:06:58,574
because here's a voice
from the trenches...

129
00:06:58,617 --> 00:07:00,244
"Parenting is really hard."

130
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:01,378
All right?

131
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,445
It's hard, and you need
at least two people.

132
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:05,684
Well, you know,
we had Mom and Dad.

133
00:07:05,724 --> 00:07:07,385
We had two people,
and they hated being parents.

134
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:08,791
I'm just saying there
are no guarantees.

135
00:07:08,827 --> 00:07:10,055
There's plenty
of single parents.

136
00:07:10,095 --> 00:07:12,586
All right. Well, I don't want
to see you get hurt.

137
00:07:12,631 --> 00:07:14,599
I mean, you could have
a kid of rage or something.

138
00:07:14,633 --> 00:07:15,964
Kid of rage?

139
00:07:16,001 --> 00:07:17,491
Yeah, well,
there was some TV movie...

140
00:07:17,536 --> 00:07:19,060
and they were crazy.

141
00:07:19,104 --> 00:07:22,073
<i>Listen, I got to go take
The Omen One and Two...</i>

142
00:07:22,107 --> 00:07:23,665
to soccer practice, okay?

143
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,700
So just stay here.
You made the right choice.

144
00:07:25,744 --> 00:07:27,006
That was a good decision, okay?

145
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:28,673
Have some coffee
or some food or something.

146
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:30,306
We have snacks.

147
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:23,529
Hey, I miss her, too.

148
00:08:36,715 --> 00:08:39,843
Somewhere a dog barked...

149
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,313
and then he licked
his privates.

150
00:08:50,729 --> 00:08:51,787
What do you think, Somewhere?

151
00:08:53,365 --> 00:08:55,026
You think we could do it alone?

152
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:57,961
Huh?

153
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:02,966
Anybody home?

154
00:09:05,644 --> 00:09:07,305
Uh, listen, Chief, I, uh...

155
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:08,643
I brought you some sun block...

156
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,841
very strong stuff.

157
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:14,375
SPF 45...
That's sun protection factor...

158
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,911
and, uh, helps you against
the ultraviolet rays...

159
00:09:16,955 --> 00:09:19,822
which are... You know,
they call them the UV rays.

160
00:09:19,858 --> 00:09:23,817
Anyway, it's hypoallergenic
and waterproof.

161
00:09:25,597 --> 00:09:27,656
Just leave it for you.

162
00:09:30,702 --> 00:09:31,964
Hi, Sophie, how you doin'?

163
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:33,028
Not bad.

164
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:37,566
You good?

165
00:09:38,977 --> 00:09:40,569
Good.

166
00:09:40,612 --> 00:09:41,977
Didn't expect
to see you back here.

167
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:43,777
Yeah, I wanted to bring
the kid some sun block.

168
00:09:44,516 --> 00:09:45,540
Oh.

169
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:49,279
What was that?

170
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:50,879
It's his Polaroid.

171
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,448
He likes taking pictures.
There's no film in it.

172
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:56,290
He's just... ha...
likes taking pictures.

173
00:09:56,328 --> 00:09:57,761
Hmm.

174
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:03,426
Just as a point of interest...

175
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:04,959
what made you think
I'd be a good match...

176
00:10:05,003 --> 00:10:07,233
for a boy who spends
most of his time in a box?

177
00:10:09,374 --> 00:10:10,898
He thinks
he's from another planet.

178
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:14,870
Yah! Aah!

179
00:10:14,913 --> 00:10:16,608
Aah!

180
00:10:16,648 --> 00:10:18,445
Yah! Unh!

181
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:19,473
- Cut!
- Looks great.

182
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:21,418
Looks great, guys.
Thank you.

183
00:10:21,453 --> 00:10:22,818
- We're going in.
- So, buddy, what do you think?

184
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:24,482
Where is the pathos?

185
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:25,956
What?

186
00:10:25,991 --> 00:10:27,549
Dude, where is the pathos?

187
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:28,719
The Earl of Dracoban is dying.

188
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,749
- This is a guy...
- Buddy!

189
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,729
Who has fought his way
across the galaxy.

190
00:10:31,763 --> 00:10:33,025
Lastupon-Lastupon
was a blue dwarf

191
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:35,295
that became a red giant.

192
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:38,394
It's the red dwarf phase
of the giant.

193
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:39,426
What are you talk...

194
00:10:39,471 --> 00:10:40,631
Look, I don't know
what I'm talkin' about.

195
00:10:40,672 --> 00:10:42,139
But this I do know...

196
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:45,610
I see a production that is
honoring the world of your book.

197
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:46,736
Really,
takin' it very seriously.

198
00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:47,767
That's what I see.

199
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,303
- Speaking of your book...
- Aah!

200
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:52,473
Guess who I got
a call from today.

201
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,782
Your publisher, our publisher.

202
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,981
- Tina.
- Tina.

203
00:10:57,022 --> 00:10:59,388
<i>Did she ask you how The Revenge
of Dracoban is coming?</i>

204
00:10:59,424 --> 00:11:00,448
No, she shouted it.

205
00:11:00,492 --> 00:11:01,857
Ah.

206
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:03,521
You know what the problem is?

207
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:04,893
When I wrote the novel...

208
00:11:06,431 --> 00:11:09,264
there's this giant massacre
at the end and everybody dies.

209
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:10,859
- I know.
- All the characters are dead.

210
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:11,892
I know. I sold it.

211
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:12,926
It's a problem.

212
00:11:12,971 --> 00:11:13,960
That's great.

213
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,133
Let's move on
to the master scene.

214
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,199
What am I gonna tell Tina?

215
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:23,372
Tell Tina that somewhere in
the deepest, darkest bowels...

216
00:11:23,415 --> 00:11:27,943
of Castle Zeptar,
the earl's necromancers...

217
00:11:27,986 --> 00:11:30,716
are bringing him back
to life against his will...

218
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:34,489
if that's possible.
Is that any good?

219
00:11:34,526 --> 00:11:35,891
Sure.

220
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:39,856
Lighting!

221
00:11:42,534 --> 00:11:44,434
Good morning! Your sword!

222
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:46,937
Move ahead!

223
00:11:48,473 --> 00:11:52,000
David,
and, hello, earth to David.

224
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,376
A kid who sits
in a box all day...

225
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:57,439
is a giant red flag,
all right?

226
00:11:57,482 --> 00:12:01,043
It's like the equivalent
of buying a used car...

227
00:12:01,086 --> 00:12:03,111
and ignoring the oil spill
in the driveway.

228
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:05,487
You know, for a non-writer
you're becoming the queen...

229
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:07,219
- of the muscular analogy.
- Okay.

230
00:12:08,093 --> 00:12:10,584
Listen, the thing about kids...

231
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,722
and I wouldn't trade
mine for the world...

232
00:12:12,764 --> 00:12:15,494
is that they keep comin'
at you, all right?

233
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:16,899
They're...
They're like mosquitoes...

234
00:12:16,935 --> 00:12:18,459
suckin' the life out of you.

235
00:12:18,503 --> 00:12:22,064
They take away your life,
your privacy, your identity.

236
00:12:22,107 --> 00:12:23,301
You should work
for Planned Parenthood.

237
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:24,434
You joke.

238
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:28,179
You forget that whole shelf-full
of books you wrote...

239
00:12:28,213 --> 00:12:30,773
or your knowledge
of California wines...

240
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:32,977
or that you ever
ran a marathon.

241
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:34,383
All right,
here's the thing, Liz.

242
00:12:34,419 --> 00:12:35,818
I never ran a marathon.

243
00:12:35,854 --> 00:12:37,014
I don't want
to run a marathon.

244
00:12:37,055 --> 00:12:39,990
I want to do something
meaningful, you know?

245
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,349
And I get all
the arguments against it.

246
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:43,418
I even get the one that says...

247
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:45,487
"I don't know if I want to bring
another kid into this world."

248
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,725
But how do you argue
with the logic...

249
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,563
of loving one
that's already here?

250
00:12:52,971 --> 00:12:55,838
<i>Trans fobo medio.
Trans fobo medio.</i>

251
00:12:55,874 --> 00:12:57,739
<i>Trans fobo medio.</i>

252
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:59,710
<i>Trans fobo medio.</i>

253
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:01,610
<i>- Dennis!
- Tran fobo medio.</i>

254
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:04,172
Dennis, what are you doing?

255
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,116
- It's raining!
- I'm waiting for David.

256
00:13:06,151 --> 00:13:07,641
What?

257
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:09,881
The man with UV protection.

258
00:13:09,921 --> 00:13:11,183
Come in.

259
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:32,141
Get over here!

260
00:13:32,177 --> 00:13:33,804
Ahem, anybody in there?

261
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:36,976
Brought you somethin'.

262
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:45,814
One, two, three, four...

263
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:49,489
Those really help
cut out the glare...

264
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:50,517
uh, one...

265
00:13:50,562 --> 00:13:52,962
in your ongoing battle
with the sun.

266
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:55,493
Thank you.

267
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:56,831
You're welcome.

268
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:58,460
One...

269
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,035
Quality throw, chief.

270
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:51,245
Nice to see ya.

271
00:14:51,289 --> 00:14:53,223
Very nice to see ya, actually.

272
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:01,123
He's not a puppy
in a window, you know?

273
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,360
I know.

274
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,562
All right,
catch it, catch it.

275
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:06,298
- Go for it.
- Okay.

276
00:15:07,739 --> 00:15:10,435
You see, he's been abandoned,
emotionally abused...

277
00:15:10,475 --> 00:15:11,965
he's classified
as "hard to place."

278
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,875
He's... He's never
had a family of his own.

279
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:16,804
I know, but am I
the right person for him?

280
00:15:16,848 --> 00:15:17,872
I mean, I'm just a writer.

281
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:20,783
He's seen a lot of doctors,
if that's what you mean.

282
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,810
That's not what he needs.

283
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:33,623
Oh, you!

284
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:35,995
At least tell me
what you're thinkin'.

285
00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:40,469
I'm thinking I must be
out of my mind.

286
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:47,341
I see you remembered
your sunscreen.

287
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:50,675
You know, it works just as good
if you don't put so much on.

288
00:15:53,985 --> 00:15:55,111
Is that your weight belt?

289
00:15:55,153 --> 00:15:57,451
Earth's gravity is weak.

290
00:15:57,489 --> 00:16:00,014
Mars is constantly
pulling me back.

291
00:16:00,058 --> 00:16:01,685
So without all that stuff...

292
00:16:01,726 --> 00:16:03,785
you think
you'd just float away?

293
00:16:04,963 --> 00:16:05,987
Uh-huh.

294
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:09,028
That ever happen before?

295
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:10,591
Yes.

296
00:16:10,635 --> 00:16:12,102
When?

297
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,105
With another
mommy and daddy.

298
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:18,531
Sophie, someone

299
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:20,204
- stole my ice cream!
- Hey! Wait up!

300
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,779
Uh, uncommunicative...

301
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,546
a tendency to steal things...

302
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:28,746
inability to form
personal attachments...

303
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:30,186
or distinguish
between right and wrong...

304
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:31,314
and he thinks...

305
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,792
He thinks
he's from outer space.

306
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:38,062
Not to put too sharp
a point on it...

307
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:40,395
but I think he thinks
he's from Mars.

308
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:41,956
How do you plan to deal
with that, Mr. Gordon?

309
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,866
Fantasy is my business.

310
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:45,494
It's... It's what
I do for a living.

311
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:48,131
And one of the things
I've learned about fantasy...

312
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,697
uh... in my own life...

313
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:52,472
is that it can be
a survival technique...

314
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,036
you know, kind
of a coping mechanism...

315
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,412
a way to deal with problems
that are bigger than you...

316
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:58,780
bigger than you're...

317
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:01,012
you're capable
of dealing with.

318
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:03,044
Uh, so, uh, you know...

319
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:07,422
the... the... the short answer is,
um, you know...

320
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,893
try to find that balance
between socializing him...

321
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:12,362
and letting him be who he is.

322
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:15,026
So, um, you know...

323
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:17,558
um, so, you know,
on the one hand...

324
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:20,265
uh, help him out
as much as I can...

325
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:23,797
and on the other hand,
uh, if he wants to...

326
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:24,831
If this little guy
wants to believe...

327
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:25,866
he's from another planet...

328
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:29,403
you know, I mean,
who am I to argue?

329
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:32,611
This isn't science fiction.
This isn't a short story.

330
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:33,982
Very often, with our children...

331
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:36,453
we don't get to have
a second draft.

332
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:37,512
Yeah.

333
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,551
A single man raising
a child with problems...

334
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:43,322
that are not common,
that are not easy...

335
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:45,159
you're gonna need
all kinds of help.

336
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:46,858
You'd need to include us...

337
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,230
- Mm-hmm.
- Include me.

338
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:49,256
Does anybody have anything?

339
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:50,495
No.

340
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:54,600
We're gonna take some time
and think about this.

341
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,107
Thank you, Mr. Gordon.

342
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:57,438
We'll let you know.

343
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:00,500
Hello.

344
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:03,106
Hey, man, what's up?

345
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:05,082
How's things on the planet?

346
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:06,414
Go away.

347
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,844
What?

348
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:13,915
Hello.

349
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:14,948
Hey.

350
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:16,722
Liz, I can't talk right now.
I'm waitin' for the call.

351
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,855
But you have call waiting.

352
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:19,921
But I don't trust it.

353
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,132
Your uncle is nuts.

354
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:41,209
Hello.

355
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:50,025
Really?

356
00:18:58,337 --> 00:18:59,531
Yes!

357
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,904
Thanks for comin'
out here with me today.

358
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,841
It's pretty.

359
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:11,907
I thought you'd like it.
It's cool.

360
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:15,052
I like the holding-down belt.

361
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:17,948
You can wear
the holding-down belt...

362
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,423
all day long if you like.

363
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:25,389
Listen, Dennis, Mr. Lefkowitz...

364
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,331
said you can come live
in my house if you want.

365
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:31,296
It'll only be temporary
at first...

366
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,794
but if you like it,
you could stay.

367
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,005
I eat Lucky Charms.

368
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:47,412
I am a big believer
in a substantial breakfast.

369
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:16,375
Get your suitcase for you.

370
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:17,746
I got it.

371
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:18,807
Okay.

372
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:21,878
Go ahead.

373
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:29,622
You can cut through here.

374
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:30,719
Oh, right over here.

375
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,290
Yeah, yeah.

376
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,362
This way, young squire.

377
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:47,144
Hey, Somewhere!

378
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,113
Hey, Somewhere,
Somewhere, down, boy.

379
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:50,341
Down, boy. Hey, sorry.

380
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:51,371
That's just Somewhere.

381
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,542
It's just his way
of saying hello.

382
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:59,216
We don't have those
where I come from.

383
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:03,160
You're not a dog person, huh?

384
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,100
I'm just waiting
for the boys to get home.

385
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,430
Well, what is he doing now?

386
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,031
He's just...
He's just in his room.

387
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,966
Should I give him
some space or go in there?

388
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:21,645
I'll call you back.
I'll call you back.

389
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:30,917
This is kind of an a...
of an interesting thing.

390
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,514
It's a special night light.

391
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:37,085
But as you can see, it has
pictures of the planets...

392
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,255
and the solar systems...

393
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,561
and, you see, they
kind of spin around.

394
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:42,260
It's got mirrors.

395
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,599
And lights on the bottom
and pictures.

396
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,635
That's not right.

397
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:50,534
Yeah?

398
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:52,099
Well, what do you mean?

399
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:55,841
You'll have to
make the ceiling bigger...

400
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:58,372
and you'll have to make
your planet like this.

401
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:00,514
You're...
You're absolutely right.

402
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:02,213
For the...
For it to be accurate...

403
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:05,417
the ceiling would have to be,
I don't know, 100 feet long...

404
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:08,051
and the earth
would be the size of a pea.

405
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,586
Very, very good.

406
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:12,824
How do you know
that much about scale?

407
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:15,924
It took a very long time
to get here.

408
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:21,263
A very, very, very
long time to get here.

409
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,309
You can get rid of some of
those old clothes if you want.

410
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:28,379
Or we can keep that old stuff...

411
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:31,871
till it literally disintegrates
and falls off your body.

412
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:34,649
That's a good way to go, too.

413
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:37,887
That's kinda cool.

414
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:39,982
I used to be good
at video games.

415
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,417
It's not a game.

416
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:43,860
It's not?

417
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:47,389
Whatever it is, it's cool.

418
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:52,425
Should I close the door...

419
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:55,304
or should I just leave it
open or halfway?

420
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,036
Leave it open?

421
00:22:58,076 --> 00:22:59,100
Mid-way?

422
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:27,537
Just think of it
as a bigger box.

423
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:42,217
All right, Dennis, I think
you're gonna enjoy this.

424
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:45,451
But, listen, before we eat,
rules of the house...

425
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:48,755
first rule,
no girls after 10 P.M.

426
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:51,157
Just kidding on that one.

427
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,129
Uh... the first rule
is that there...

428
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:56,964
There really aren't
any rules, you know?

429
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:59,368
Just maybe
some basic stuff about...

430
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:00,462
Oh!

431
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:05,201
Better put a sticker
there, I guess.

432
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:07,905
Listen, maybe we can,
uh, have a...

433
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,437
I don't know,
more of a guideline...

434
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:12,109
more than a rule,
that we don't...

435
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,209
um, wear
the sunglasses indoors...

436
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:16,686
just for
navigational purposes.

437
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:20,124
I mean, this is
a grilled cheese sandwich.

438
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:21,489
Uh, I made you
a grilled cheese sandwich...

439
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:22,823
'cause I love
grilled cheese sandwiches.

440
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:26,228
I think that they're,
you know, an American classic.

441
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,866
I used to eat these a lot
when I was a kid.

442
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:32,130
I loved 'em.

443
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,839
I eat Lucky Charms.

444
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:45,374
Yeah, sure, for breakfast,
you can have Lucky Charms...

445
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:48,284
or maybe some granola or yogurt,
any kind of cereal.

446
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,548
That sounds great.

447
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:54,113
<i>So, anyway, bon appetit.</i>

448
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,863
Try that.

449
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:09,970
I eat Lucky Charms.

450
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,942
Oh, here we go.

451
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:15,004
Look at that.

452
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:18,648
All right, let's get more...

453
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:21,049
because, you know,
you never know.

454
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:23,554
We gotta stock up.

455
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:26,113
Never know if there's
gonna be the avian bird flu...

456
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:27,317
or bubonic plague...

457
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,954
or any other sort of pandemic
is gonna come along...

458
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:33,487
and really wreck your day.

459
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,466
Want to make sure
you have the right supplies.

460
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,540
This stuff has...
This stuff has gotta have...

461
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:47,875
a shelf life
of about 33,000 years.

462
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:50,837
If anything happened...

463
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:55,444
the, um, apocalypse,
the four horsemen show up...

464
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:58,047
this stuff is still
magically delicious.

465
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:07,959
We're Lucky Charms guys.

466
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:14,770
Mary?

467
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:25,878
Dennis, are you okay?
What are you doin'?

468
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,384
Watching you.

469
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:30,748
Oh!

470
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:34,014
It's a little late for that.

471
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,083
Dennis?

472
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:41,328
Dennis, what are you doin'?

473
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:43,095
Come on, let's...
Let's put the camera away.

474
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:44,362
Dennis, please.
Let's put the camera away.

475
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:45,426
Come on now.

476
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:50,736
Beware!
I almost Disney-grated you.

477
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,265
You almost disintegrated me?

478
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,175
Why would you want to do that?

479
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:58,607
Hey, it's the, um... ahem.

480
00:26:58,650 --> 00:26:59,844
It's the middle
of the night, chief.

481
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:01,146
What are you doin'
with all these pictures?

482
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:02,881
And what are you doin' up?

483
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:04,388
Learning.

484
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:06,481
Learning? Learning what?

485
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:09,857
How to be a human
and part of a family.

486
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:12,089
I think you speak
for a lot of us there.

487
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:15,792
Um...

488
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:22,201
That's very good.

489
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,140
That's very realistic.

490
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:30,912
Um, maybe we ought to
pick this up in the morning...

491
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:32,746
over a bowl of Lucky Charms,
what do you say?

492
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:34,877
Maybe we should go to bed now.

493
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:37,010
Yeah, yeah, I saw that.

494
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:39,023
That's a very good expression.

495
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:12,612
Yeah?

496
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:14,682
Yes, Mr. Gordon.
Hi, Mr. Lefkowitz...

497
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:15,920
- from Children's Services.
- Wh-What? Who?

498
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,428
This is Mr. Lefkowitz
from Children's Services.

499
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:20,192
Oh, hi. Hello, sir.
How are you?

500
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:21,391
Well, good.

501
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:23,025
More to the point, how are you?

502
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:25,161
Couldn't be better.
Couldn't be better.

503
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,761
Good. How's Dennis?

504
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:28,170
Is there anything
we should talk about?

505
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,941
Mr. Gordon?

506
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:33,204
Hello, Mr. Gordon.

507
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:34,711
Uh, yeah. I'm here.

508
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:36,771
Yeah, hi. I was asking if... if...

509
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:38,282
Do you have any
concerns about Dennis...

510
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:39,476
that you'd like to talk about?

511
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:40,984
No, no.
Everything's going great.

512
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,043
Couldn't be better, sir.

513
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:22,917
Hmm...

514
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,723
I think it's time to get
you out of the house.

515
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:31,692
Listen, imagination
is a rare commodity.

516
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:34,034
Dennis has the soul
of an artist.

517
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:35,232
He could grow up
to be, you know...

518
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,400
<i>become a prodigy like...
You saw Amadeus.</i>

519
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:40,172
He could be a little Mozart
in waiting for all you know.

520
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:43,745
Mom, he's being gross.

521
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,876
- Come on.
- Guys, let it go, okay?

522
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:47,907
Remember?

523
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,715
It all ends up
in the same place, right?

524
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:50,948
Come on, guys.

525
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:56,450
I mean, I want to be sensitive,
but he's a mess.

526
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:58,121
Hey, that's sensitive?

527
00:29:58,163 --> 00:29:59,221
You should hear blunt.

528
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:00,424
No, but really.

529
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:03,798
Listen, my point is that
not everybody is born to be...

530
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:06,429
a go-with-the-flow,
happy little Gap-kid.

531
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,904
Right now, it looks like
he's gonna grow up...

532
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:10,874
to be Tiny Tim
with a ukulele, all right?

533
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:13,434
What, are you
breeding geniuses now?

534
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:18,643
Mozart, by the way, died
in a hovel at 27, drunk and...

535
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:21,481
Unspecified fever at 35.

536
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:22,918
Stuff like that.

537
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:26,048
Sure, we all enjoyed his music,
but did he enjoy himself?

538
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,284
Give me a chance.

539
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,054
You know, David,
as far as I'm concerned...

540
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:30,583
they're all from Mars.
At least your kid admits it.

541
00:30:30,628 --> 00:30:31,617
See, this is a smart man.

542
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:32,721
That's the correct answer, man.

543
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:33,822
- Smart man. Right.
- You married a smart man.

544
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:36,163
I know.
I agree they're all from Mars.

545
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:39,336
Strike two!

546
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:40,462
Two and two the count...

547
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,807
as Bobby Miller gets
ready for the pitch.

548
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:43,296
As Bobby Miller gets
ready for the pitch.

549
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,738
Here we go.

550
00:30:46,777 --> 00:30:48,506
Strike three!

551
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:50,446
That was a nice strike-out, huh?

552
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:51,971
It's called a strike-out.

553
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,916
It's pretty cool, huh?
You want a peanut?

554
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:55,843
You know what's really cool
about baseball?

555
00:30:55,886 --> 00:30:57,751
You know what I love
about baseball?

556
00:30:57,788 --> 00:30:59,483
Baseball is the only sport...

557
00:30:59,523 --> 00:31:02,151
where you can fail 70 percent
of the time and still be great.

558
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:04,957
It's about trying hard and
never, ever, ever givin' up.

559
00:31:04,995 --> 00:31:05,984
Just think about it.

560
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,759
If you get a hit
three out of every 10 times...

561
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:09,789
you're at bat,
you're really good.

562
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:11,529
If you do
a little bit better than that...

563
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:13,093
just a little bit
better than that...

564
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:15,571
maybe 3.2, 3.3 times...

565
00:31:17,274 --> 00:31:20,334
you're great,
and you could be a star.

566
00:31:20,377 --> 00:31:22,368
And you're gonna make it
to the Big Show.

567
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:23,880
And if you do that
on the Big Show...

568
00:31:23,914 --> 00:31:25,506
you're a superstar.

569
00:31:25,549 --> 00:31:27,744
Superstars don't exist.

570
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:31,221
Only supernovas or white dwarfs.

571
00:31:32,289 --> 00:31:33,916
I deserve you.

572
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:35,289
I really do.

573
00:31:38,128 --> 00:31:39,652
You're out.

574
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:41,392
This guy doesn't look
like much of a hitter.

575
00:31:44,034 --> 00:31:45,558
But we believe, don't we?

576
00:31:46,904 --> 00:31:47,928
Come on, now!

577
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:51,269
Strike three!

578
00:31:51,308 --> 00:31:52,639
It's not lookin' pretty.

579
00:31:52,676 --> 00:31:55,270
We're down by seven runs.

580
00:31:55,312 --> 00:31:56,301
We're not hittin' a lick.

581
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:57,371
Come on, batter.

582
00:31:57,414 --> 00:31:58,938
We need a hit.

583
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:00,314
Right on the ball!

584
00:32:01,685 --> 00:32:02,674
Yeah!

585
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,085
There you go.

586
00:32:04,121 --> 00:32:05,748
Got a single.
Get something started.

587
00:32:05,789 --> 00:32:07,313
I did it.

588
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:08,825
You did what?

589
00:32:08,859 --> 00:32:10,918
I made a Martian wish.

590
00:32:12,029 --> 00:32:13,587
You made a...

591
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:15,861
You made a Martian wish?

592
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,425
Yeah.
Martians can wish for stuff.

593
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:20,494
Like hits?

594
00:32:20,537 --> 00:32:21,731
Whatever.

595
00:32:21,772 --> 00:32:24,332
You know, sometimes
I make earth wishes...

596
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:25,865
but they don't always work out.

597
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:30,040
Well, listen, since
you're in the wishing mode...

598
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,174
see this guy comin' up
to the plate?

599
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:34,946
Wish for a home run.

600
00:32:42,793 --> 00:32:44,124
Go! Go! Go!

601
00:32:44,161 --> 00:32:46,925
That ball is gone!

602
00:32:50,434 --> 00:32:51,458
Want him to win?

603
00:32:55,172 --> 00:32:57,766
Unbelievable. What
an awesome display of power.

604
00:32:57,808 --> 00:33:00,402
You're a prognosticator,
you're a scholar...

605
00:33:00,444 --> 00:33:03,208
and now you're a baseball
fanatic, and I like it.

606
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:04,805
...all the way back to 1973.

607
00:33:04,848 --> 00:33:08,340
Let's hear it
for those Coal Miners. Now...

608
00:33:08,385 --> 00:33:09,374
Unbelievable game.

609
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,853
Unbelievable game.

610
00:33:12,823 --> 00:33:14,848
This isn't looking pretty.

611
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:16,416
Do you know we spend
an average of two weeks...

612
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:19,588
in a lifetime waiting
for traffic lights?

613
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:20,824
I remember when
all these lights...

614
00:33:20,864 --> 00:33:23,162
were timed, you know,
when they were synchronized?

615
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,861
And you could just find this
little seam in the universe...

616
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:26,836
and float through.

617
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:33,942
Wow. Did you see that?

618
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:38,540
Yup. I just gave you
three minutes of your life back.

619
00:33:39,683 --> 00:33:42,516
Well, thank you.
I'll use them wisely.

620
00:33:44,421 --> 00:33:45,615
Do that again.

621
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:47,214
Nope.

622
00:33:47,257 --> 00:33:49,487
Why? 'Cause you don't want to
or 'cause you can't?

623
00:33:49,526 --> 00:33:53,121
I only have
so many Martian wishes.

624
00:33:53,163 --> 00:33:54,528
That's fair.

625
00:33:56,033 --> 00:33:59,867
But if you want,
I can give you one.

626
00:34:01,972 --> 00:34:04,167
Who wouldn't want one?

627
00:34:21,925 --> 00:34:25,417
There, I just gave you
a Martian wish.

628
00:34:25,462 --> 00:34:28,192
Don't waste it.

629
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,427
I absolutely won't. I promise.

630
00:34:30,467 --> 00:34:32,867
I'll use it for something
really important.

631
00:34:34,938 --> 00:34:36,667
That was really intense.

632
00:34:38,008 --> 00:34:45,616
You're just a freaky
little dude, man.

633
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:47,584
Ahem.

634
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:49,552
Hey, Somewhere.

635
00:34:51,088 --> 00:34:52,555
- This is Harlee.
- Hi.

636
00:34:52,589 --> 00:34:54,386
She's... She's our good friend,
me and Somewhere.

637
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,916
She helped design
this whole garden, so...

638
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:02,992
Nice frame.

639
00:35:04,334 --> 00:35:05,824
I've heard a lot about you.

640
00:35:07,604 --> 00:35:09,629
You want to say hi?

641
00:35:09,673 --> 00:35:10,799
- No?
- It's okay.

642
00:35:10,841 --> 00:35:11,967
Don't worry. Don't worry.

643
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:17,136
Isn't he wild?

644
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:20,412
He's great,
like a little Andy Warhol.

645
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:23,147
He has the same social skills,
by the way.

646
00:35:25,789 --> 00:35:27,484
You know what I think it is?

647
00:35:27,524 --> 00:35:29,287
What?

648
00:35:29,326 --> 00:35:31,760
He's an old soul.

649
00:35:31,795 --> 00:35:34,389
What does that mean?

650
00:35:34,431 --> 00:35:36,058
Seriously.

651
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,933
It just means
he's figured it out.

652
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,603
You're one relentlessly
sunny individual.

653
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,699
Yeah, well, I don't
always wake up that way.

654
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:49,171
And that is what
we so admire about you.

655
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:51,909
This particular move here
that he's got goin'...

656
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:55,441
can't be sanitary or safe.

657
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,612
He likes to vacuum.

658
00:35:56,653 --> 00:35:58,018
No, no, no,
he thinks he is the vacuum.

659
00:35:58,055 --> 00:36:00,819
There's a difference, see?

660
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:03,292
That's so Zen.

661
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,658
It is, kind of, isn't it?

662
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:05,753
Yeah.

663
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:09,893
See? More sunshine.

664
00:36:12,369 --> 00:36:15,065
Keep your hips towards me,
though, if you can.

665
00:36:15,105 --> 00:36:16,333
Just move this foot
a little towards me.

666
00:36:16,373 --> 00:36:18,364
No, no, not
that part of your hips.

667
00:36:18,408 --> 00:36:19,875
Just square yourself
up this way.

668
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:20,934
Right like that, right?

669
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:22,673
And then hand on the bat...

670
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:24,203
and, remember,
you're gonna step forward.

671
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:26,216
When you hit the ball,
you can yell, "Hot coffee!"

672
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:28,045
Say it.

673
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:29,074
Hot coffee!

674
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:30,177
Say, "Hot coffee!"

675
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:33,516
All right, forget it.

676
00:36:33,557 --> 00:36:35,491
Seven out of ten times
you can fail...

677
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:36,584
but you're still a star.

678
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:37,651
A little better than that...

679
00:36:37,694 --> 00:36:38,854
you'll go to the Big Show
for a cup of coffee.

680
00:36:38,896 --> 00:36:40,056
I like this game.

681
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:41,496
I know. It's good, right?

682
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,829
It's a great game.

683
00:36:42,866 --> 00:36:45,994
So, eye on the ball and swing.

684
00:36:46,036 --> 00:36:48,163
That was a little late.

685
00:36:48,205 --> 00:36:50,435
Watch the ball hit the bat.

686
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:52,567
Watch. Just have your eyes
go right there.

687
00:36:54,711 --> 00:36:56,235
What is with your pitching?

688
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,406
- Here we go.
- Oh!

689
00:36:57,447 --> 00:36:58,436
That was a little too early.

690
00:36:58,482 --> 00:36:59,642
- But it was so good.
- Yeah.

691
00:36:59,683 --> 00:37:00,707
It was a good form.

692
00:37:01,985 --> 00:37:04,180
Almost, Dennis, that was nice.

693
00:37:04,221 --> 00:37:06,018
All right now,
with fierce determination.

694
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,827
Want to see you,
you know, just groove on it.

695
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:13,193
You know, get a little attitude.

696
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,663
You know, a little swagger.
You touch the plate.

697
00:37:14,698 --> 00:37:15,858
Come on, you're a lefty.

698
00:37:15,899 --> 00:37:17,662
You're weird, you're eccentric,
nobody understands you.

699
00:37:17,701 --> 00:37:18,861
You don't
even understand yourself.

700
00:37:18,902 --> 00:37:20,631
You know what I'm sayin'? Yeah.

701
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:21,695
Yeah.

702
00:37:21,738 --> 00:37:23,763
Yeah, that's what
I'm talkin' about. Yeah.

703
00:37:23,807 --> 00:37:26,071
Now hands back,
give me the eagle eye.

704
00:37:26,109 --> 00:37:27,269
I'm scared.

705
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:29,074
That's what I'm talkin' about.

706
00:37:30,113 --> 00:37:31,910
Oh! Oh!

707
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:33,814
Hot coffee!

708
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:35,442
Hot coffee.

709
00:37:35,485 --> 00:37:37,885
Oh! Hot coffee!

710
00:37:37,921 --> 00:37:38,979
Yeah, you drove it
it down the line.

711
00:37:39,022 --> 00:37:40,819
That's a fair ball! Run!

712
00:37:40,857 --> 00:37:42,119
Run! Run, Dennis!

713
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:43,251
Fair ball! Run!

714
00:37:43,293 --> 00:37:45,523
Drop the bat and run. Run.

715
00:37:45,562 --> 00:37:46,551
Run!

716
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,792
- Dennis, run.
- Go, run! Run!

717
00:37:48,832 --> 00:37:50,857
- Come on!
- Run! Quick!

718
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:52,095
Come on now.

719
00:37:55,639 --> 00:37:56,799
Oh, thank you, sweetie.

720
00:37:59,743 --> 00:38:01,335
What was that for?

721
00:38:01,378 --> 00:38:04,006
'Cause they're giving medals
to all the wrong guys.

722
00:38:22,699 --> 00:38:24,360
Hello, my name is Jeff.

723
00:38:27,137 --> 00:38:28,297
Hey, buddy.

724
00:38:29,606 --> 00:38:33,474
I'm a friend of your...
David's...

725
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:35,034
um, and I have
this present for you.

726
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:37,438
You're his agent.

727
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,073
Yes, I am.

728
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:41,277
Wow, that's, pfft, very good.

729
00:38:41,318 --> 00:38:42,842
I'm impressed.

730
00:38:42,886 --> 00:38:44,854
Where is, um, David?

731
00:38:44,888 --> 00:38:46,082
Is he inside?

732
00:38:46,923 --> 00:38:48,083
Is he inside?

733
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:50,719
Is he writing?
Is he writing inside?

734
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:51,887
Okay, buddy, listen, I'm...

735
00:38:51,928 --> 00:38:54,294
- Hey, Jeff!
- Hey, buddy, how are ya?

736
00:38:54,331 --> 00:38:55,855
Good to see you.
You met Dennis, huh?

737
00:38:55,899 --> 00:38:57,924
Yeah, we've just been
getting to know each other.

738
00:38:57,968 --> 00:38:59,128
If he gets hungry...

739
00:38:59,169 --> 00:39:01,364
Lucky Charms
all night long, right?

740
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:03,771
Lucky Charms.

741
00:39:03,807 --> 00:39:04,967
Knuckles?

742
00:39:05,008 --> 00:39:07,442
He's not...
It takes a while.

743
00:39:07,477 --> 00:39:09,707
Hi. We're gonna go.

744
00:39:09,746 --> 00:39:12,442
See you, buddy.
Nice to see ya.

745
00:39:12,482 --> 00:39:13,471
God, I'm so proud of you, man...

746
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,984
- Yeah.
- Re-entering your life...

747
00:39:15,018 --> 00:39:16,246
fantastic.

748
00:39:16,286 --> 00:39:18,948
It's not going very well.

749
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:20,889
Buddy, you know what?

750
00:39:20,924 --> 00:39:22,892
There is a long
and proud tradition...

751
00:39:22,926 --> 00:39:24,826
of asking for help
in the form of a nanny.

752
00:39:24,861 --> 00:39:25,850
- No!
- There's absolutely...

753
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:27,193
No, there's no shame in that.

754
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:28,356
I'm not talking about...

755
00:39:28,398 --> 00:39:29,729
I'm not talking about Dennis.
He's fine.

756
00:39:29,766 --> 00:39:30,790
I'm talking about, you know...

757
00:39:30,834 --> 00:39:32,096
the book's not going
particularly well.

758
00:39:32,135 --> 00:39:33,329
What... What's, um...

759
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:34,564
What's going on
with the book?

760
00:39:34,604 --> 00:39:36,572
Does that mean like...

761
00:39:36,606 --> 00:39:37,766
sagging-in-the-middle
not good or what?

762
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:38,866
- No.
- Like the ending?

763
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:40,001
You havin' a hard time
noodling the ending?

764
00:39:40,043 --> 00:39:41,203
Can I help you? Is
there anything I can help...

765
00:39:41,244 --> 00:39:42,677
No, no, it's just that
there's an essential idea...

766
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:43,771
I haven't come to grips with.

767
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:45,645
But you know the great thing
about Dennis?

768
00:39:45,682 --> 00:39:48,014
He is a fountain of ideas.

769
00:39:48,051 --> 00:39:50,645
He is challenging all
my assumptions, all of them...

770
00:39:50,687 --> 00:39:52,678
every one of them,
and I am going with it.

771
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:55,715
I just got to learn
to be a little less rigid.

772
00:39:55,759 --> 00:39:56,748
Or a little more rigid.

773
00:39:56,793 --> 00:39:58,556
Yup, it's great.

774
00:39:58,595 --> 00:40:00,222
I'm so excited...

775
00:40:00,263 --> 00:40:02,094
that you're figuring out
the rigidity...

776
00:40:02,132 --> 00:40:04,623
<i>but, buddy, I am livin'
The Revenge of Dracoban...</i>

777
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:05,692
on a daily basis...

778
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:08,227
and the forces of darkness
are closin' in on me, man.

779
00:40:08,271 --> 00:40:09,704
Tina's coming to town.

780
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,708
Yeah, she's havin' a big
black tie party for you...

781
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:12,731
- and she expects you
- Party?

782
00:40:12,776 --> 00:40:14,767
To ritualistically
hand over to her...

783
00:40:14,811 --> 00:40:16,335
the first draft ever written...

784
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,575
<i>of The Revenge of Dracoban
Part Two, the sequel.</i>

785
00:40:18,615 --> 00:40:19,604
When?

786
00:40:19,649 --> 00:40:20,980
About six weeks from now.

787
00:40:21,017 --> 00:40:22,279
You know, so that's it.

788
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:23,308
When?

789
00:40:23,353 --> 00:40:24,445
January 28th.

790
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:25,819
She's doing it January 28th.

791
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,949
What is the significance
of that date?

792
00:40:27,991 --> 00:40:28,980
I don't know.

793
00:40:29,025 --> 00:40:30,287
She's doing a book signing
or something that night.

794
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:31,259
The book signing at the...

795
00:40:31,294 --> 00:40:33,421
I got to get a sitter!

796
00:40:33,463 --> 00:40:34,760
Buddy, are you losin' your mind?

797
00:40:34,798 --> 00:40:35,856
No.

798
00:40:35,899 --> 00:40:37,059
Because if you are...

799
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,658
I just need
a little bit of lead time.

800
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:39,726
Don't you think
I deserve that...

801
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:44,574
- after all these years?
- Don't worry.

802
00:40:44,574 --> 00:40:47,065
You sure you don't want me
to come in with you?

803
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:48,270
Yes.

804
00:40:48,311 --> 00:40:49,710
Yes, come in?

805
00:40:49,746 --> 00:40:51,611
No. Don't come in.

806
00:40:51,648 --> 00:40:53,206
Don't come in.

807
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,275
You need the umbrella?

808
00:40:55,318 --> 00:40:56,307
Yes.

809
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:59,186
And the weight belt's
an absolutely essential item?

810
00:40:59,222 --> 00:41:01,349
- ¢Ü Just let your feelings roll on by ¢Ü
- Uh-Huh.

811
00:41:01,391 --> 00:41:03,291
Okay. You're gonna have...

812
00:41:03,326 --> 00:41:06,056
- a great first day.
- ¢Ü Don't wear fear ¢Ü

813
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:07,085
¢Ü Or nobody will know ¢Ü

814
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:09,496
- ¢Ü You're here ¢Ü
- Dennis. Dennis. Dennis.

815
00:41:10,867 --> 00:41:12,835
- ¢Ü Lift your head ¢Ü
- Listen, just...

816
00:41:12,869 --> 00:41:15,702
¢Ü And let your feelings
out instead ¢Ü

817
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:17,707
Just be yourself.

818
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:19,038
¢Ü Don't be shy ¢Ü

819
00:41:19,075 --> 00:41:20,440
That's all
you got to do, okay?

820
00:41:20,477 --> 00:41:23,446
¢Ü Just let your feelings
roll on by ¢Ü

821
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:27,109
¢Ü On by ¢Ü

822
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:30,449
- ¢Ü You know love ¢Ü
- Dennis, Dennis, Dennis, Dennis.

823
00:41:30,487 --> 00:41:33,479
- ¢Ü Is better than a song ¢Ü
- That way.

824
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:40,855
¢Ü Love is where
all of us belong ¢Ü

825
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:44,929
¢Ü So don't be shy ¢Ü

826
00:41:44,968 --> 00:41:48,131
¢Ü Just let your feelings
roll on by ¢Ü

827
00:41:56,279 --> 00:41:57,712
Hey, Zack,
you wanna play football?

828
00:41:57,747 --> 00:41:58,736
Hey, retard.

829
00:41:58,782 --> 00:42:00,773
Yeah, we see you.

830
00:42:00,817 --> 00:42:02,182
You little punks.

831
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:10,486
Sir, is there a problem?

832
00:42:10,527 --> 00:42:11,585
Uh, no, no, no...

833
00:42:11,628 --> 00:42:14,563
not at...
I'm just here to watch.

834
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:15,690
Yeah, that's a problem.

835
00:42:15,732 --> 00:42:16,790
No, no, no.

836
00:42:16,833 --> 00:42:18,733
This is
a total misunderstanding.

837
00:42:18,768 --> 00:42:21,032
This is not
what it appears to be.

838
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:23,801
Do you... I'm a new parent.

839
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,829
That... That...

840
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,308
He's my... He's my son...

841
00:42:26,343 --> 00:42:27,901
and it's his first day...

842
00:42:27,944 --> 00:42:29,138
and I was really concerned.

843
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:31,044
I came to
check on my daughter.

844
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:32,343
Oh.

845
00:42:32,382 --> 00:42:34,543
That's my baby
right there in the brown.

846
00:42:34,584 --> 00:42:36,711
- Driving the, uh...
- Mm-hmm.

847
00:42:36,753 --> 00:42:37,777
Which one's yours?

848
00:42:40,056 --> 00:42:41,751
Over off on the side there...

849
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:43,850
hanging upside down.

850
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,555
- Weirdo.
- I know.

851
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:49,057
Good luck to you, sir.

852
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:50,930
Yeah.

853
00:42:50,967 --> 00:42:53,458
He says he's counteracting
earth's gravitational pull...

854
00:42:53,503 --> 00:42:56,597
because it impedes
the blood flow to his brains.

855
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,369
That's what the yogis believe.

856
00:42:58,408 --> 00:43:00,205
Yogis don't have to go
to second grade.

857
00:43:00,243 --> 00:43:02,711
Hey, there's no harm
in being a little eccentric.

858
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:04,236
This I know.

859
00:43:07,317 --> 00:43:10,150
So, he thinks
he's from Mars...

860
00:43:10,186 --> 00:43:12,711
and you write about Mars,
that's great.

861
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:16,351
A little Martian chose you
to teach him about being human.

862
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:19,760
Come on. He came to earth
to document our existence.

863
00:43:22,332 --> 00:43:24,630
<i>Listen, when I was 11 years old,
I saw The Sound of Music...</i>

864
00:43:24,668 --> 00:43:26,693
and from that moment on,
I was convinced...

865
00:43:26,736 --> 00:43:28,931
I was the lost
von Trapp sister.

866
00:43:28,972 --> 00:43:29,996
You?

867
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:34,135
Yeah, but did you go
to school in lederhosen?

868
00:43:34,177 --> 00:43:35,235
Yes, I did.

869
00:43:35,278 --> 00:43:37,337
That's a good look for you.

870
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:39,940
- He's a sweet little boy...
- Yeah.

871
00:43:39,983 --> 00:43:45,478
But, uh,
he's not like the others.

872
00:43:45,522 --> 00:43:47,251
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

873
00:43:49,292 --> 00:43:50,316
The, uh, social worker says...

874
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,622
he has
above average intelligence...

875
00:43:51,661 --> 00:43:52,650
but, you know, I guess...

876
00:43:52,696 --> 00:43:55,824
it just takes time
for him to adjust.

877
00:43:55,865 --> 00:43:58,129
He steals
from the other children.

878
00:44:00,637 --> 00:44:02,434
Steals?

879
00:44:02,472 --> 00:44:07,171
We find things in his cubby:
Shoes, pencils, retainers.

880
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:09,542
Um, you know, Dennis
has a really curious mind...

881
00:44:09,579 --> 00:44:10,773
and I think
he just really needs...

882
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,782
You know, if it were only...

883
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,408
If it were only
about the stealing...

884
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:17,545
but Dennis needs
special attention...

885
00:44:17,587 --> 00:44:20,522
that we're simply
not equipped to offer here.

886
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:22,149
What do you mean
you're not equipped to offer?

887
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:24,851
I'm sorry.

888
00:44:24,894 --> 00:44:26,885
About what?

889
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:28,090
What are you saying?

890
00:44:28,131 --> 00:44:29,758
You're saying
you're throwing him out?

891
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:38,472
Well, that's really...

892
00:44:40,777 --> 00:44:42,745
That's really cold.

893
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:47,515
- Mr. Gordon.
- Hi.

894
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:49,484
Dennis and I had
a nice, long chat.

895
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:51,612
Good. How'd that go, pal?

896
00:44:51,655 --> 00:44:53,816
I'm an intelligent being.

897
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:55,381
I completely agree.

898
00:44:55,425 --> 00:44:56,449
Yeah.

899
00:44:58,194 --> 00:45:00,321
Um, why don't you and I chat?

900
00:45:00,363 --> 00:45:02,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You want to wait here?

901
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:10,567
What do I do for Dennis?

902
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:12,404
I mean, to...

903
00:45:12,442 --> 00:45:13,534
Do what you're doing.

904
00:45:13,576 --> 00:45:16,545
Just, you know,
you got to give this some time.

905
00:45:16,579 --> 00:45:18,479
You know, doctor,
I'm really concerned.

906
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:21,507
I mean, he's not
making any friends...

907
00:45:21,551 --> 00:45:24,611
and he's not relating
to me particularly well...

908
00:45:24,654 --> 00:45:26,747
and he just got expelled
from school for stealing...

909
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:28,655
and he's
a very isolated little guy.

910
00:45:28,692 --> 00:45:31,286
And when he, uh, you know,
when he's vulnerable...

911
00:45:31,327 --> 00:45:34,296
and scared like that,
I just...

912
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:35,354
I mean, when he tells me...

913
00:45:35,398 --> 00:45:37,366
he thinks
he's gonna float away.

914
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:41,095
He probably thinks
he's gonna float away...

915
00:45:41,137 --> 00:45:43,435
because he's very smart...

916
00:45:43,473 --> 00:45:44,838
and he sees that
he's living in a world...

917
00:45:44,874 --> 00:45:48,173
where things
and people do disappear.

918
00:45:51,247 --> 00:45:55,616
I could give him a prescription,
but, honestly, I...

919
00:45:55,652 --> 00:45:59,520
I think that seeing how
another intelligent being...

920
00:45:59,556 --> 00:46:01,581
keeps his feet on the ground...

921
00:46:01,624 --> 00:46:03,956
would be far more therapeutic
for Dennis.

922
00:46:03,993 --> 00:46:07,019
Mr. Gordon,
all parents feel...

923
00:46:07,063 --> 00:46:10,294
like they're the blind
leading the blind.

924
00:46:10,333 --> 00:46:12,002
Sure.

925
00:46:12,068 --> 00:46:14,366
Listen, pal, I got to talk
to you about something.

926
00:46:14,404 --> 00:46:19,865
Um, after Christmas break,
we're gonna start a new school.

927
00:46:19,909 --> 00:46:21,968
And I want to see
how you feel about it...

928
00:46:22,012 --> 00:46:25,743
because that can be kinda scary,
startin' a new school...

929
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:28,444
and, you know, your teacher
thinks it's a good idea...

930
00:46:28,485 --> 00:46:30,112
and... and... and so do I.

931
00:46:30,153 --> 00:46:32,883
And, um...

932
00:46:32,922 --> 00:46:34,947
Uh...

933
00:46:34,991 --> 00:46:36,618
It's good
to measure things, huh?

934
00:46:37,994 --> 00:46:39,791
Anyway, how do you feel
about it?

935
00:46:39,829 --> 00:46:41,956
You okay
to take a fresh start?

936
00:46:41,998 --> 00:46:43,966
Take a fresh run
at a new school?

937
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:50,167
Would you be up for that?

938
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:53,137
Hmm?

939
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:57,177
What are you looking at?

940
00:46:57,213 --> 00:46:59,340
That's where they found me...

941
00:46:59,382 --> 00:47:02,510
on the grass
by the big, round building.

942
00:47:02,552 --> 00:47:04,520
It was raining.

943
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:09,384
You know what's weird
is that was so long ago...

944
00:47:09,426 --> 00:47:11,451
I would think
you couldn't remember it.

945
00:47:11,494 --> 00:47:14,327
I couldn't, so how could you?

946
00:47:14,364 --> 00:47:17,424
They'll come back
someday to get me.

947
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:19,332
Like, like summer camp?

948
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:20,859
You don't believe me.

949
00:47:20,904 --> 00:47:24,806
So Martians
can read minds, too, huh?

950
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:27,708
Martians can do lots
of things you can't.

951
00:47:27,744 --> 00:47:31,544
Besides changing traffic lights,
what can you do?

952
00:47:31,581 --> 00:47:32,980
We can taste color.

953
00:47:34,651 --> 00:47:35,640
Okay.

954
00:47:35,685 --> 00:47:37,448
You can taste color.

955
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:38,784
Prove it to me.

956
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:40,847
Off with the glasses,
close your eyes.

957
00:47:45,895 --> 00:47:47,863
They said this would happen.

958
00:47:47,897 --> 00:47:49,091
Open up.

959
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,994
Open... Don't... You were lookin'.

960
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:54,799
You were totally lookin'.

961
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:57,500
Right, open up. Here we go.

962
00:47:58,575 --> 00:47:59,837
What color is it?

963
00:48:06,116 --> 00:48:07,140
Red.

964
00:48:07,183 --> 00:48:08,548
All right,
but that one doesn't count...

965
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:12,783
because we had obvious
ethical complications.

966
00:48:12,822 --> 00:48:14,312
Open up.

967
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:22,054
Green.

968
00:48:22,098 --> 00:48:23,793
Very good.

969
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,628
Open up.

970
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:35,302
Yellow.

971
00:48:35,345 --> 00:48:36,778
Yes, it was.

972
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:42,543
This one?

973
00:48:45,822 --> 00:48:47,346
Well?

974
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:50,120
I can't taste it.

975
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,354
It's blue.

976
00:48:51,394 --> 00:48:54,090
I know.
I can't taste blue.

977
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:02,704
A little too bright?

978
00:49:03,973 --> 00:49:05,941
Shade it back up.

979
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:13,982
Come, Flomar.

980
00:49:14,017 --> 00:49:16,485
Did you just call Somewhere
"Flomar"?

981
00:49:16,519 --> 00:49:19,750
It's Martian
for "warm, furry friend."

982
00:49:19,789 --> 00:49:22,121
He picked it.

983
00:49:22,158 --> 00:49:23,557
Oh.

984
00:49:28,631 --> 00:49:29,893
All right.

985
00:49:29,933 --> 00:49:31,195
You want to get
a glass of water for you?

986
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:32,326
- No.
- ¢Ü Jingle bells ¢Ü

987
00:49:32,368 --> 00:49:34,233
- No, thank you.
¢Ü Jingle bells ¢Ü

988
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:36,534
Where do you...
Where do you want him to sit?

989
00:49:36,573 --> 00:49:38,063
Hey, it doesn't matter.
Anywhere you want.

990
00:49:38,107 --> 00:49:39,938
Be laissez-faire
about it, right?

991
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:41,534
Okay, does he have turkey...

992
00:49:41,578 --> 00:49:42,875
or should I get
some Lucky Charms?

993
00:49:42,912 --> 00:49:45,779
I don't know.
Ask boy wonder over there.

994
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:48,509
Okay.

995
00:49:50,286 --> 00:49:53,255
Hey. Hey, Dennis.

996
00:49:53,289 --> 00:49:55,280
Do you want to have
some turkey with us?

997
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:59,489
I can't eat anything
grown on Saturn's moons.

998
00:50:00,697 --> 00:50:02,756
- Hmm.
- Well, then, I think you're safe here.

999
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:05,097
That'll be great.

1000
00:50:05,134 --> 00:50:06,999
Okay, buddy?

1001
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:14,869
You ever notice how far apart
his eyes are actually set?

1002
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:16,105
No.

1003
00:50:16,145 --> 00:50:18,272
Or that his ears are
just a little bit pointy?

1004
00:50:18,314 --> 00:50:19,508
Little bit.

1005
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:20,914
David?

1006
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:25,279
All this time
I was thinking...

1007
00:50:25,321 --> 00:50:26,413
that I was no good
as a father, right?

1008
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:27,514
Uh-huh.

1009
00:50:27,557 --> 00:50:28,956
And that, you know,
I was working the Mars...

1010
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:30,016
as a metaphor angle.

1011
00:50:30,059 --> 00:50:31,458
But then I was
thinking to myself...

1012
00:50:31,494 --> 00:50:32,859
what if that's not it?

1013
00:50:32,895 --> 00:50:35,830
What if he actually
really is imbued, you know...

1014
00:50:35,865 --> 00:50:37,355
with some special...

1015
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:40,233
You know,
he could be a little medium.

1016
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:41,828
- David, you're hysterical.
- I know.

1017
00:50:41,871 --> 00:50:44,032
See, everybody says,
"Don't be hysterical."

1018
00:50:44,073 --> 00:50:45,700
But I say,
"Why not be hysterical?"

1019
00:50:45,742 --> 00:50:48,336
Hysterical is the new calm.

1020
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:50,175
My wife dies, boom...

1021
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:52,272
I go out and I adopt
a kid from Neptune.

1022
00:50:52,315 --> 00:50:54,681
Should I just chill,
or should I be hysterical?

1023
00:50:54,717 --> 00:50:55,945
You tell me.

1024
00:50:55,985 --> 00:50:57,714
I think hysteria
is a way of life.

1025
00:50:57,754 --> 00:50:59,221
It's a clothing line
at least.

1026
00:50:59,255 --> 00:51:00,415
I could stop writing...

1027
00:51:00,456 --> 00:51:01,514
not that I'm writing anyway.

1028
00:51:01,557 --> 00:51:04,958
David, I'm...
I'm worrying about you.

1029
00:51:04,994 --> 00:51:06,359
Why?

1030
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:08,159
Because I think
what's really going on here...

1031
00:51:08,197 --> 00:51:11,360
is you guys
are really struggling.

1032
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:14,063
You think I don't know that?

1033
00:51:14,103 --> 00:51:15,832
I know that.

1034
00:51:19,208 --> 00:51:22,109
You know, you're still
in a trial period.

1035
00:51:22,145 --> 00:51:23,942
I mean...

1036
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:27,211
You can return him like
a defective toaster, right?

1037
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,512
Is that what you mean?

1038
00:51:30,186 --> 00:51:33,917
L... I guess what I'm trying
to say is that I...

1039
00:51:33,956 --> 00:51:37,016
I know you see
a lot of yourself in him...

1040
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:39,255
but, David, I was there.

1041
00:51:39,295 --> 00:51:41,729
You were weird,
and you had problems...

1042
00:51:41,764 --> 00:51:44,631
but this kid
is in a whole other league.

1043
00:51:44,667 --> 00:51:46,294
You know, what is
so amazing about you...

1044
00:51:46,336 --> 00:51:48,429
is that you're right.

1045
00:51:48,471 --> 00:51:50,029
You're always right...

1046
00:51:50,073 --> 00:51:51,768
and you remember
when you're right...

1047
00:51:51,808 --> 00:51:54,368
and you never let
anybody else forget it.

1048
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:56,037
I'm gonna just go out
for a minute.

1049
00:51:57,914 --> 00:51:59,643
Hey, come on, Dennis.

1050
00:51:59,682 --> 00:52:00,944
Let's get out of here.

1051
00:52:00,983 --> 00:52:03,713
Gee, this was fun, huh?

1052
00:52:03,753 --> 00:52:05,118
A little later...

1053
00:52:05,154 --> 00:52:06,553
- David?
- I can make you some
Lucky Charms or something.

1054
00:52:06,589 --> 00:52:08,784
- David? David, don't.
- That's okay.

1055
00:52:08,825 --> 00:52:10,884
- Come on, it's Christmas.
- Well, you know, whatever.

1056
00:52:10,927 --> 00:52:12,087
- Of course, it is.
- You know?

1057
00:52:12,128 --> 00:52:13,152
Where... Where you going?

1058
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:17,956
David?

1059
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,058
Come on.

1060
00:52:19,102 --> 00:52:20,194
Hey.

1061
00:52:20,236 --> 00:52:22,898
Come on. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean...

1062
00:52:22,939 --> 00:52:24,406
Well, "trial period,"
is that a code?

1063
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:25,907
- Okay.
- Some kind of code?

1064
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:27,000
'Cause you said that.

1065
00:52:27,043 --> 00:52:28,442
- I know.
- L... You know what?

1066
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:29,570
I, I, l...

1067
00:52:29,612 --> 00:52:30,601
Everything's okay.
Everything's cool.

1068
00:52:30,646 --> 00:52:32,136
- I was just trying...
- You know, I'm just tired.

1069
00:52:32,181 --> 00:52:33,170
I'm just tired.

1070
00:52:33,216 --> 00:52:35,878
But it's Christmas, David.

1071
00:52:35,918 --> 00:52:38,045
- No. We'll come over tomorrow.
- Just relax.

1072
00:52:38,087 --> 00:52:39,179
We'll come over tomorrow, okay?

1073
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:26,889
Dennis!

1074
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:29,824
Was I bad?

1075
00:54:29,866 --> 00:54:31,458
No, you weren't bad...

1076
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:32,968
and you got to stop
saying that, all right?

1077
00:54:33,002 --> 00:54:34,526
I don't want you
to cut your feet.

1078
00:54:34,570 --> 00:54:36,697
And Daddy's...

1079
00:54:36,739 --> 00:54:38,001
I'm in here working.

1080
00:54:39,342 --> 00:54:42,243
We got to put this camera away
for a little while, okay?

1081
00:54:42,278 --> 00:54:43,870
But I haven't finished
my mission.

1082
00:54:43,913 --> 00:54:46,404
Well, you have for today.

1083
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:49,316
But I haven't
finished my mission!

1084
00:54:49,352 --> 00:54:50,819
Give me my camera back!

1085
00:54:50,853 --> 00:54:51,979
I need it!

1086
00:54:52,021 --> 00:54:54,854
Hey, you got to calm down.

1087
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:57,291
I have to go to work,
or you can go to your room.

1088
00:54:58,294 --> 00:55:01,661
You're gonna send me away,
aren't you?

1089
00:55:02,965 --> 00:55:04,796
Dennis,
why would I send you away?

1090
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:10,803
Because you're mad at me
because I broke your stuff.

1091
00:55:11,774 --> 00:55:13,639
Dennis, I don't care
about any of that stuff.

1092
00:55:15,011 --> 00:55:16,342
This is stuff.

1093
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:18,774
There's nothing you can do...

1094
00:55:18,814 --> 00:55:20,179
that would ever change
the way I feel.

1095
00:55:21,684 --> 00:55:22,810
Do you understand?

1096
00:55:24,253 --> 00:55:26,016
Not gonna ever send you away.

1097
00:55:28,024 --> 00:55:29,685
Look, this is just stuff.

1098
00:55:46,142 --> 00:55:48,042
Come on, break it
like you mean it.

1099
00:55:49,211 --> 00:55:50,974
One more.

1100
00:55:51,013 --> 00:55:52,275
Let it go, buddy.

1101
00:55:53,549 --> 00:55:55,642
Here's two. Oh, just one.

1102
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:57,516
Nice one! Over the head...

1103
00:55:57,553 --> 00:55:58,611
over the head, big time.

1104
00:55:58,654 --> 00:56:01,316
Like the Greeks.

1105
00:56:01,357 --> 00:56:03,552
That feels so good.

1106
00:56:03,593 --> 00:56:04,685
No, not that plate!

1107
00:56:04,727 --> 00:56:06,524
I got an idea,
but we'll still have fun.

1108
00:56:06,562 --> 00:56:07,790
We'll still have fun.

1109
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:14,795
I'm sorry.
I'm just trying to have...

1110
00:56:14,837 --> 00:56:16,566
I'm just trying to have...
I'm so sorry.

1111
00:56:16,606 --> 00:56:17,664
I was just trying
to have fun, buddy.

1112
00:56:19,041 --> 00:56:20,474
What's that laugh?

1113
00:56:20,509 --> 00:56:22,306
Oh, oh, oh!

1114
00:56:28,818 --> 00:56:30,445
Oh, my, oh!

1115
00:56:30,486 --> 00:56:31,919
I will wail on you!

1116
00:56:31,954 --> 00:56:33,546
This is war!

1117
00:56:33,589 --> 00:56:35,716
- This is war!
- Whoa!

1118
00:56:35,758 --> 00:56:37,157
Whoa!

1119
00:56:41,397 --> 00:56:42,864
Uh-Oh.

1120
00:56:45,267 --> 00:56:48,031
Uh, just stay here.

1121
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:55,438
Pss pss...

1122
00:57:00,449 --> 00:57:02,212
Hey, Mr. Lefkowitz,
uh, come on in.

1123
00:57:02,251 --> 00:57:05,379
Uh, what a surprise.
Happy holidays.

1124
00:57:05,421 --> 00:57:07,252
Thank you. You, too.

1125
00:57:07,289 --> 00:57:11,692
Uh, we were just,
uh, having, uh...

1126
00:57:11,727 --> 00:57:12,853
just having some fun.

1127
00:57:12,895 --> 00:57:14,226
Sort of a, uh...

1128
00:57:14,263 --> 00:57:17,289
It's a breakthrough,
you could say.

1129
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:18,459
Nice to see you.

1130
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:22,267
Very, uh, vigilant of you
to come during the holidays.

1131
00:57:22,304 --> 00:57:24,431
I heard there was
a little trouble at school.

1132
00:57:24,473 --> 00:57:27,271
Just a little trouble.

1133
00:57:27,309 --> 00:57:28,970
Nothing we can't handle.

1134
00:57:29,011 --> 00:57:30,035
Right?

1135
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:31,103
Would you mind very much...

1136
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:33,115
if Dennis and I
went up to his room?

1137
00:57:33,149 --> 00:57:34,241
Maybe he could
show me his room.

1138
00:57:34,283 --> 00:57:35,944
We could chat for a bit.

1139
00:57:38,954 --> 00:57:41,286
No, I wouldn't mind.
Would you mind?

1140
00:57:41,323 --> 00:57:43,484
Would that be okay, Dennis?

1141
00:57:46,328 --> 00:57:47,625
I think it's okay with Dennis.

1142
00:57:47,663 --> 00:57:48,960
Good.

1143
00:57:48,998 --> 00:57:50,226
Where's your room, Dennis?

1144
00:57:50,266 --> 00:57:51,255
It's downstairs.

1145
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:53,165
He'll show you.

1146
00:57:53,202 --> 00:57:54,396
Thank you.

1147
00:57:57,573 --> 00:57:59,097
Following you.

1148
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:02,134
Everything is...

1149
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:10,744
Everything all right?

1150
00:58:10,786 --> 00:58:12,811
Hey, you knew
about this stuff?

1151
00:58:12,855 --> 00:58:17,155
Uh, we're just
gonna turn that off real quick.

1152
00:58:17,193 --> 00:58:19,354
Yeah, yeah, sure,
we're, we're, um...

1153
00:58:19,395 --> 00:58:21,124
Have you seen this?

1154
00:58:21,163 --> 00:58:22,994
Yeah, yeah,
I know all about this.

1155
00:58:23,032 --> 00:58:25,865
This is a science project
that we're working on.

1156
00:58:25,901 --> 00:58:27,198
Kind of
a whole transformation...

1157
00:58:27,236 --> 00:58:28,635
and decay kind of a thing.

1158
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:29,729
We take all the stuff
from the house...

1159
00:58:29,772 --> 00:58:30,796
and we put it
in the baggies.

1160
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:33,570
We take photos of it,
and we put it away...

1161
00:58:33,609 --> 00:58:34,598
then we come back to it.

1162
00:58:34,643 --> 00:58:37,009
Uh, Dennis and l...
Uh, Dennis mostly...

1163
00:58:37,046 --> 00:58:38,843
He'd study how it's...

1164
00:58:39,915 --> 00:58:40,904
See, we're doin'
it right now.

1165
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:41,939
Car keys.

1166
00:58:41,984 --> 00:58:43,281
- Sure.
- You know, car keys.

1167
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:45,184
- Yours?
- Yeah, they are.

1168
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:46,984
Passport, yours?

1169
00:58:47,022 --> 00:58:48,114
I knew about that, too.

1170
00:58:48,157 --> 00:58:49,988
It's amazing how much
a passport can decay.

1171
00:58:50,025 --> 00:58:51,049
Everything's good.
Everything's fine here.

1172
00:58:51,093 --> 00:58:52,117
Everything's great.

1173
00:58:52,161 --> 00:58:53,856
We just try
to do the things and see...

1174
00:58:53,896 --> 00:58:55,591
how they have transformed
and decayed or not.

1175
00:58:55,631 --> 00:58:57,292
- If...
- Sometimes they don't.

1176
00:58:57,333 --> 00:58:58,425
We could just talk in private.

1177
00:58:58,467 --> 00:58:59,525
Yeah.

1178
00:58:59,568 --> 00:59:02,469
Good. Excuse us
one second, Dennis.

1179
00:59:02,505 --> 00:59:03,631
Outside.

1180
00:59:03,672 --> 00:59:05,139
Please.

1181
00:59:05,174 --> 00:59:08,200
I'm just a little bit
concerned here, Mr. Gordon.

1182
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:10,576
You seem to suffer
from a syndrome...

1183
00:59:10,613 --> 00:59:12,843
many adopting parents
experience.

1184
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:14,213
Shock?

1185
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:15,979
You're so eager
to become the child's friend...

1186
00:59:16,018 --> 00:59:17,849
you forget to be a parent.

1187
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,582
And Dennis needs
a parent right now.

1188
00:59:19,622 --> 00:59:21,021
He needs a strong role model.

1189
00:59:21,056 --> 00:59:24,048
He needs someone
to bring him down to earth.

1190
00:59:24,093 --> 00:59:26,152
He's been stealing again.

1191
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:27,594
He's been
expelled from school.

1192
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:29,029
I think "expelled"
is a harsh word.

1193
00:59:29,064 --> 00:59:30,827
I think there was
a consensus reached...

1194
00:59:30,866 --> 00:59:32,424
that it wasn't
the right place for him.

1195
00:59:32,468 --> 00:59:34,663
Yeah, a consensus includes me.

1196
00:59:34,703 --> 00:59:36,432
The principal
gave me no option.

1197
00:59:36,472 --> 00:59:40,533
L... I should have called,
and I apologize for that.

1198
00:59:40,576 --> 00:59:42,771
I'm gonna move your case up
for a review.

1199
00:59:42,812 --> 00:59:45,178
You'll be notified by mail.

1200
00:59:45,214 --> 00:59:47,409
I'll let myself out.

1201
00:59:51,053 --> 00:59:53,681
Mr. Lefkowitz, I do know...

1202
00:59:53,722 --> 00:59:54,984
that there's no one
on this planet...

1203
00:59:55,024 --> 00:59:58,016
that loves Dennis
any more than I do.

1204
00:59:58,060 --> 00:59:59,584
I know that.

1205
01:00:09,505 --> 01:00:12,736
These pictures are mine.

1206
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:16,878
And they're
really important to me.

1207
01:00:16,913 --> 01:00:20,007
And I need to understand
why you took 'em.

1208
01:00:20,049 --> 01:00:21,380
Will you tell me?

1209
01:00:21,417 --> 01:00:23,977
Please, I need you to tell me.

1210
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:26,420
Because you love her so much.

1211
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:31,083
Hmm.

1212
01:00:36,399 --> 01:00:38,196
Ahem, that's really true...

1213
01:00:38,234 --> 01:00:42,330
but that doesn't change
the way I feel about you, pal.

1214
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:45,873
Not even a little.

1215
01:00:52,015 --> 01:00:53,710
You know,
Mr. Lefkowitz isn't sure...

1216
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:56,617
that it's such a good idea
that you stay here...

1217
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,678
so we gotta make him happy.

1218
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:03,990
So when you're here at home,
it's okay to be from Mars.

1219
01:01:05,194 --> 01:01:06,183
But when you're out there...

1220
01:01:06,229 --> 01:01:08,595
with the rest
of the earthlings...

1221
01:01:08,631 --> 01:01:10,690
you know,
you gotta go by earth rules.

1222
01:01:11,901 --> 01:01:18,363
But what we will never do
is we will never, ever...

1223
01:01:18,408 --> 01:01:23,710
ever, ever, ever,
ever give up.

1224
01:01:23,746 --> 01:01:25,976
Winston Churchill said that,
I think.

1225
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:29,115
There's one other thing.

1226
01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:31,552
It's really serious.

1227
01:01:31,587 --> 01:01:34,181
Will you please teach me...

1228
01:01:34,223 --> 01:01:36,885
how to do that
disidney-grate thing?

1229
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:40,721
How you do it?

1230
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:44,027
You'll get it.

1231
01:01:55,845 --> 01:01:57,005
We have to do this.

1232
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:58,172
I can't. You do it.

1233
01:01:58,214 --> 01:02:01,775
I think it should be
this shirt with these.

1234
01:02:01,818 --> 01:02:03,581
Okay.

1235
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:06,419
It looks hot on you.

1236
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:09,849
He'll look devastating.

1237
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:11,382
He will. He will.
That's fine.

1238
01:02:11,427 --> 01:02:13,691
- That's fine.
- Right?

1239
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:15,891
What age do they start
making fun of you...

1240
01:02:15,932 --> 01:02:17,160
if you wear the wrong clothes?

1241
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,189
- I don't know.
- You know, like, uh...

1242
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:19,223
if you're not cool.
What... What...

1243
01:02:19,268 --> 01:02:20,257
- Fifth grade?
- Fifth grade?

1244
01:02:20,303 --> 01:02:21,736
That's when I started wearing...

1245
01:02:21,771 --> 01:02:24,740
my rainbow-colored
leg warmers every day.

1246
01:02:24,774 --> 01:02:27,538
Pretty much solidified
my role as the weird girl...

1247
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:28,566
who sat in the back of class...

1248
01:02:28,611 --> 01:02:30,306
drawing Smurfs
until ninth grade.

1249
01:02:33,449 --> 01:02:34,780
But...

1250
01:02:35,852 --> 01:02:36,944
But what?

1251
01:02:38,554 --> 01:02:40,283
Maybe it's
not supposed to be easy.

1252
01:02:40,323 --> 01:02:41,585
I mean, maybe the ones
who have it easy...

1253
01:02:41,624 --> 01:02:43,182
they're missing
part of the adventure.

1254
01:02:43,226 --> 01:02:44,625
Ah.

1255
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:47,185
Don't you think all the truly
fascinating people...

1256
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:49,698
in the world probably had
dysfunctional childhoods?

1257
01:02:49,732 --> 01:02:50,960
You sold me.
I'm gonna send him to school...

1258
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,592
in the rainbow-colored
leg warmers.

1259
01:02:52,635 --> 01:02:53,659
- Please don't.
- I will.

1260
01:02:53,703 --> 01:02:55,432
I'm not that fascinating.

1261
01:02:58,508 --> 01:03:00,066
Uh, thing about it is...

1262
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:01,736
I just worry about him
all the time.

1263
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:03,541
It's the curse
of being a parent.

1264
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:08,250
I think Dennis is happier
than he's been in a long time.

1265
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:09,444
Yeah.

1266
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:14,082
I think you are, too.

1267
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:24,660
I should go.

1268
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:26,395
It's late, and I'm tired.

1269
01:03:26,436 --> 01:03:27,425
Do you want me
to make some coffee...

1270
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:29,563
for the ride home
or something or...

1271
01:03:29,605 --> 01:03:31,129
or you could just stay here.

1272
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:33,734
In the guest bedroom.

1273
01:03:33,776 --> 01:03:35,937
You don't have a guest bedroom.

1274
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:37,309
That's right.
Best you were on the couch.

1275
01:03:37,346 --> 01:03:38,370
I didn't... Believe me, that...

1276
01:03:38,414 --> 01:03:39,540
That's not what I meant.

1277
01:03:39,582 --> 01:03:40,606
That was the furthest...

1278
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:42,880
furthest thing from my mind.
Really.

1279
01:03:42,919 --> 01:03:44,216
Oh, really? The furthest?

1280
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:46,118
Well, not the furthest thing
from my mind.

1281
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:48,419
There's just things that
are a little further away...

1282
01:03:48,458 --> 01:03:50,790
like smallpox or, you know.

1283
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:52,954
It's really...

1284
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:54,053
I gotta go.

1285
01:03:54,096 --> 01:03:55,825
I gotta go feed the goldfish.

1286
01:03:55,865 --> 01:03:57,264
The goldfish?

1287
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:59,632
I'm taking care
of my neighbor's goldfish.

1288
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:01,193
Your neighbor's.

1289
01:04:01,237 --> 01:04:02,363
- Yes.
- I see.

1290
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:06,232
Uh, uh...

1291
01:04:06,275 --> 01:04:08,436
They need to get fed.

1292
01:04:08,478 --> 01:04:09,672
Goldfish, huh?

1293
01:04:18,821 --> 01:04:20,220
- Good night.
- Yeah.

1294
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:22,783
Uh... oh.

1295
01:04:24,393 --> 01:04:25,621
You okay?

1296
01:04:25,661 --> 01:04:26,650
Uh, yeah. Are you okay?

1297
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:27,958
I don't know.

1298
01:04:27,997 --> 01:04:29,965
You are. You look okay.

1299
01:04:29,999 --> 01:04:31,193
- So do you.
- Okay. Bye.

1300
01:04:31,234 --> 01:04:32,326
You look great.

1301
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:33,528
- What?
- You look good.

1302
01:04:33,569 --> 01:04:34,797
Oh, you, too.

1303
01:04:48,184 --> 01:04:49,913
You look great.

1304
01:04:49,952 --> 01:04:51,317
Great.

1305
01:04:52,488 --> 01:04:54,217
It's a cloudy day.

1306
01:04:54,257 --> 01:04:55,451
I know.

1307
01:04:55,491 --> 01:04:58,051
That's why you don't need
all that sun block.

1308
01:04:58,094 --> 01:04:59,959
I do have a little bit
of bad news, though.

1309
01:04:59,996 --> 01:05:03,591
We're gonna have to do
without the holding-down belt.

1310
01:05:03,633 --> 01:05:06,227
But I'll float away.

1311
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:08,464
I don't know much,
but I know this.

1312
01:05:08,504 --> 01:05:11,234
You will not float away.

1313
01:05:11,274 --> 01:05:12,263
Promise?

1314
01:05:12,308 --> 01:05:13,332
Guarantee it.

1315
01:05:15,011 --> 01:05:16,000
But you know... Come on.

1316
01:05:16,045 --> 01:05:17,569
You know,
what I was gonna tell you is...

1317
01:05:17,613 --> 01:05:19,080
I don't know
if I ever told you this...

1318
01:05:19,115 --> 01:05:21,982
but when I was a kid,
I used to pretend...

1319
01:05:22,018 --> 01:05:23,713
like I was
from another planet.

1320
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:25,516
Why did you do that?

1321
01:05:25,555 --> 01:05:27,113
Well, I was going
to a new school...

1322
01:05:27,156 --> 01:05:28,180
and I was nervous...

1323
01:05:28,224 --> 01:05:29,521
and I wanted people
to like me...

1324
01:05:29,559 --> 01:05:33,620
and, you know, I was afraid
I wouldn't fit in and...

1325
01:05:33,663 --> 01:05:34,789
Did you wear a hat?

1326
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:39,000
Um, yeah.

1327
01:05:39,035 --> 01:05:40,161
Yeah, sometimes I did...

1328
01:05:40,202 --> 01:05:41,430
'cause it was Chicago,
and it was cold...

1329
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:42,767
so sometimes I wore a hat.

1330
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:46,770
You shouldn't
have worn a hat.

1331
01:05:48,911 --> 01:05:50,139
There it is.

1332
01:05:50,179 --> 01:05:52,272
Well, anyway, after a while...

1333
01:05:52,315 --> 01:05:55,842
I learned to be a little bit
more like everybody else...

1334
01:05:55,885 --> 01:05:57,250
and to fit in a little bit.

1335
01:05:57,286 --> 01:05:59,948
And you know what?
It wasn't so bad.

1336
01:05:59,989 --> 01:06:02,617
It really wasn't so bad.

1337
01:06:02,658 --> 01:06:04,990
Is it good to be
like everyone else?

1338
01:06:06,662 --> 01:06:08,994
That's a really good question.

1339
01:06:09,031 --> 01:06:11,932
Um, which is usually
what adults say...

1340
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:13,128
when they don't
have the answer.

1341
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:18,407
I think what's important
right now to remember...

1342
01:06:18,441 --> 01:06:20,932
is that you need
to learn stuff.

1343
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:22,444
About human beingness.

1344
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:23,740
Exactly right.

1345
01:06:23,779 --> 01:06:25,974
Instead of, you know...

1346
01:06:26,015 --> 01:06:27,243
Human Martianness.

1347
01:06:27,283 --> 01:06:31,117
Which you already know
a lot about, right?

1348
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:32,552
- You're welcome.
- Hi, Miss Margie.

1349
01:06:32,588 --> 01:06:34,146
Mr. Gordon, hi.

1350
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:36,920
Nice to see you.
Do you remember Dennis?

1351
01:06:36,959 --> 01:06:38,551
- Hello, Dennis.
- Miss Margie.

1352
01:06:38,594 --> 01:06:41,028
Don't worry.
We're all very nice here.

1353
01:06:43,299 --> 01:06:45,733
Hey, listen, pal.

1354
01:06:45,768 --> 01:06:48,498
If you feel like you're nervous
or you can't handle it...

1355
01:06:48,537 --> 01:06:49,663
I'm gonna be right out there...

1356
01:06:49,705 --> 01:06:51,366
and you can come get me
in the car.

1357
01:06:55,044 --> 01:06:57,740
What if I don't feel good
after you leave?

1358
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:58,769
Well, you can come get me.

1359
01:06:58,814 --> 01:07:00,338
I'll be there all day.

1360
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:04,081
- All day?
- Mm-hmm.

1361
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:05,485
All day.

1362
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:08,615
Okay. Your daddy
has to go now, Dennis.

1363
01:07:08,658 --> 01:07:09,682
Okay?

1364
01:07:12,728 --> 01:07:14,662
Okay, here you go, pal.

1365
01:07:15,931 --> 01:07:17,125
We're a little nervous...

1366
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:18,861
'cause we don't have
our weight belt today.

1367
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:21,392
We're havin' gravity issues.

1368
01:07:21,437 --> 01:07:22,961
Okay, pal.

1369
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:13,021
"And the radios crackled
up and down the line...

1370
01:08:13,055 --> 01:08:15,421
"as the fighter lords
received the command...

1371
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:18,120
"and turned to their soldiers
instructing...

1372
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:20,321
<i>"Fall where you stand.</i>

1373
01:08:20,362 --> 01:08:23,422
<i>"Fall where you stand."</i>

1374
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:30,664
<i>And that is enough
of Dracoban for one night.</i>

1375
01:08:30,706 --> 01:08:33,800
Good night, sweet prince.

1376
01:08:42,985 --> 01:08:48,548
¢Ü Shinin' like a work of art ¢Ü

1377
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:55,927
¢Ü Hangin' on a wall of stars ¢Ü

1378
01:08:57,199 --> 01:09:03,399
¢Ü Are you
what I think you are? ¢Ü

1379
01:09:09,278 --> 01:09:14,739
¢Ü You're my satellite ¢Ü

1380
01:09:16,385 --> 01:09:22,722
¢Ü You're riding
with me tonight ¢Ü

1381
01:09:22,758 --> 01:09:26,194
¢Ü Passenger side,
lighting the sky ¢Ü

1382
01:09:26,228 --> 01:09:30,631
¢Ü Always the first star
that I find ¢Ü

1383
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:36,366
¢Ü You're my satellite ¢Ü

1384
01:09:49,485 --> 01:09:55,048
¢Ü You're my satellite ¢Ü

1385
01:09:56,292 --> 01:10:03,425
¢Ü You're my satellite ¢Ü

1386
01:10:05,534 --> 01:10:07,403
Nice talk.

1387
01:10:15,077 --> 01:10:16,476
David!

1388
01:10:16,512 --> 01:10:17,911
David!

1389
01:10:17,947 --> 01:10:18,971
Yeah!

1390
01:10:22,251 --> 01:10:23,616
I'm coming!

1391
01:10:27,756 --> 01:10:29,314
Dennis, you okay, pal?
What's wrong?

1392
01:10:29,358 --> 01:10:30,825
What's wrong? What's wrong?

1393
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:32,487
Flomar.

1394
01:10:35,931 --> 01:10:37,523
Somewhere?

1395
01:10:42,304 --> 01:10:43,362
Ohh.

1396
01:10:43,405 --> 01:10:44,895
What's wrong with him?

1397
01:10:47,042 --> 01:10:48,566
Oh, Somewhere.

1398
01:10:49,511 --> 01:10:50,876
What happened?

1399
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:52,540
Is he okay?

1400
01:10:55,050 --> 01:10:56,039
No, no.

1401
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:57,450
He died.

1402
01:10:59,221 --> 01:11:00,313
Died?

1403
01:11:10,332 --> 01:11:11,356
Damn it.

1404
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:55,999
Hey, let's go for a ride.

1405
01:11:56,045 --> 01:11:57,034
Let's go for a ride.

1406
01:11:57,079 --> 01:11:58,068
Let's get out of here.

1407
01:11:58,113 --> 01:11:59,341
We'll go look at the stars.

1408
01:11:59,381 --> 01:12:00,814
Come on, pal.

1409
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:03,584
When I was
a little boy like you...

1410
01:12:03,619 --> 01:12:05,314
I used to think
when you lost somebody...

1411
01:12:05,354 --> 01:12:06,514
they would go up there
in the stars...

1412
01:12:06,555 --> 01:12:07,749
and you can't
see 'em anymore...

1413
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:09,951
but you can talk to 'em,
and they can hear you.

1414
01:12:12,361 --> 01:12:13,794
Is that why
you were crying...

1415
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:17,094
because you won't see
Flomar anymore?

1416
01:12:19,034 --> 01:12:20,365
When you love somebody...

1417
01:12:20,402 --> 01:12:22,700
it's really hard when
you can't see 'em anymore.

1418
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:29,906
Do you talk to Mary?

1419
01:12:32,214 --> 01:12:35,206
In a way I do, yeah,
all the time.

1420
01:12:38,754 --> 01:12:40,381
That's probably
why I come out here.

1421
01:12:46,095 --> 01:12:47,995
I can see Mars.

1422
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:50,260
Get out. Where?
I can't see it.

1423
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,227
Oh, that's a good eye.

1424
01:12:58,073 --> 01:12:59,904
What do you think
of when you see Mars?

1425
01:13:00,943 --> 01:13:03,810
That my mission is almost over.

1426
01:13:03,846 --> 01:13:05,814
I'll be going back soon...

1427
01:13:05,848 --> 01:13:08,510
and then everything
will go back to normal.

1428
01:13:09,918 --> 01:13:11,977
Dennis, can I just say
one last thing about Mars...

1429
01:13:12,021 --> 01:13:13,147
which may be strange...

1430
01:13:13,188 --> 01:13:14,519
coming from
a science fiction writer...

1431
01:13:14,556 --> 01:13:16,456
but, right now,
you and me, here...

1432
01:13:16,492 --> 01:13:18,551
put together
entirely from atoms...

1433
01:13:18,594 --> 01:13:22,894
sitting on this round rock
with a core of liquid iron...

1434
01:13:22,931 --> 01:13:26,697
held down by this force, that so
troubles you, called gravity...

1435
01:13:26,735 --> 01:13:27,997
all the while spinning
around the sun...

1436
01:13:28,037 --> 01:13:29,595
at 67,000 miles an hour...

1437
01:13:29,638 --> 01:13:31,401
and whizzing
through the Milky Way...

1438
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:33,431
at 600,000 miles an hour...

1439
01:13:33,475 --> 01:13:36,467
in a universe that very well
may be chasing its own tail...

1440
01:13:36,512 --> 01:13:38,673
at the speed of light.

1441
01:13:38,714 --> 01:13:41,478
And amidst all
this frantic activity...

1442
01:13:41,517 --> 01:13:43,348
fully cognizant
of our own imminent demise...

1443
01:13:43,385 --> 01:13:44,613
which is a very pretty way
of saying...

1444
01:13:44,653 --> 01:13:47,679
we all know
we're gonna die...

1445
01:13:47,723 --> 01:13:50,556
we reach out to one another.

1446
01:13:52,494 --> 01:13:54,223
Sometimes
for the sake of vanity...

1447
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:55,628
sometimes for reasons...

1448
01:13:55,664 --> 01:13:57,928
you're not old enough
to understand yet...

1449
01:13:57,966 --> 01:13:59,194
but a lot of the time...

1450
01:13:59,234 --> 01:14:03,364
we just reach out and
expect nothing in return.

1451
01:14:05,174 --> 01:14:06,607
Isn't that strange?

1452
01:14:08,544 --> 01:14:10,171
Isn't that weird?

1453
01:14:12,214 --> 01:14:13,875
Isn't that weird enough?

1454
01:14:16,351 --> 01:14:18,683
What the heck do you need
to be from Mars for?

1455
01:14:35,204 --> 01:14:37,968
So, look, we're
just gonna talk to 'em...

1456
01:14:38,006 --> 01:14:40,133
and we're gonna tell 'em about
all of the human stuff...

1457
01:14:40,175 --> 01:14:44,475
we like to do,
and, you know...

1458
01:14:44,513 --> 01:14:45,912
it'll be over
before you know it...

1459
01:14:45,948 --> 01:14:49,384
and everything will be fine.

1460
01:14:49,418 --> 01:14:50,783
Okay, deal?

1461
01:14:52,554 --> 01:14:55,045
'Cause if I'm myself...

1462
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:56,921
they won't let me
to stay with you.

1463
01:15:00,062 --> 01:15:01,893
No. No, no.

1464
01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:02,954
Hey.

1465
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:15,109
Whatever you say,
it's gonna be okay.

1466
01:15:19,848 --> 01:15:21,873
I love you very, very much.

1467
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:27,311
Ah, you got
your ankle weights there.

1468
01:15:32,628 --> 01:15:33,686
Be yourself.

1469
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:37,760
- Come on.
- Hey.

1470
01:15:37,799 --> 01:15:39,130
- Hi, Sophe.
- Hi.

1471
01:15:39,168 --> 01:15:41,432
Okay, come with me, huh?

1472
01:15:41,470 --> 01:15:43,529
It's gonna be okay.

1473
01:15:43,572 --> 01:15:45,096
Let me go get
some coffee here.

1474
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:46,732
It's all all right.

1475
01:15:54,683 --> 01:15:59,382
So, Dennis, how you
getting along at school?

1476
01:16:01,190 --> 01:16:02,214
Okay.

1477
01:16:03,292 --> 01:16:05,487
Is there something
you want to tell us about?

1478
01:16:06,929 --> 01:16:08,726
No.

1479
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:12,833
You don't seem
very happy today, Dennis.

1480
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:17,698
I'm stellar.

1481
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:27,041
So, um, all this moving
from school to school...

1482
01:16:27,082 --> 01:16:29,744
how... how's... how's that
been for you?

1483
01:16:29,785 --> 01:16:32,515
Mm, there's been
some rough times...

1484
01:16:32,554 --> 01:16:34,044
but the important thing...

1485
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:38,048
is to, um, you have
to face your problems...

1486
01:16:38,093 --> 01:16:42,723
and you should
never ever, ever, ever...

1487
01:16:42,764 --> 01:16:46,791
ever, ever give up.

1488
01:16:46,835 --> 01:16:50,236
Never ever, ever, ever.

1489
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:54,133
Winston Churchill said that...

1490
01:16:54,176 --> 01:16:56,337
I think.

1491
01:16:56,378 --> 01:16:58,846
Winston Churchill,
he was a very smart man, huh?

1492
01:17:00,382 --> 01:17:03,112
Hey, Dennis,
when we've spoken before...

1493
01:17:03,151 --> 01:17:05,483
you... you said that you were
from another planet.

1494
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:06,509
Mars.

1495
01:17:06,555 --> 01:17:08,489
Mars, right.

1496
01:17:08,523 --> 01:17:10,320
<i>Zepper nicki whawok.</i>

1497
01:17:10,359 --> 01:17:12,623
<i>Trans fobo medio.</i>

1498
01:17:19,201 --> 01:17:21,066
Sometimes
it's okay to pretend...

1499
01:17:21,103 --> 01:17:23,663
and sometimes it isn't.

1500
01:17:23,705 --> 01:17:26,640
So you...
You were just pretending?

1501
01:17:26,675 --> 01:17:28,233
Uh-huh.

1502
01:17:29,911 --> 01:17:32,846
And then
I started doing science...

1503
01:17:32,881 --> 01:17:36,749
and I realized we were
spinning around the sun...

1504
01:17:36,785 --> 01:17:43,884
at 67,000 miles an hour...

1505
01:17:43,925 --> 01:17:46,120
held in place by gravity.

1506
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:49,824
So what the heck do I need
to be from Mars for?

1507
01:17:50,799 --> 01:17:53,029
I think it was
because I didn't fit in.

1508
01:17:55,003 --> 01:17:59,736
And then I started to learn
how to be like everyone else.

1509
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:03,144
Dennis, did, um...

1510
01:18:03,178 --> 01:18:08,445
Did Mr. Gordon coach you
on... on what to say here today?

1511
01:18:08,483 --> 01:18:11,452
He only coached me on one thing.

1512
01:18:11,486 --> 01:18:14,114
What's that?

1513
01:18:14,156 --> 01:18:18,422
If you hit three out of ten,
you're a star.

1514
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:21,793
If you get even
a little better than that...

1515
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:25,596
a little better than that,
you're a superstar.

1516
01:18:28,003 --> 01:18:30,335
You get a cup of coffee.

1517
01:18:32,341 --> 01:18:34,172
Hot coffee.

1518
01:18:39,782 --> 01:18:41,807
Well, how'd it... How'd it go?

1519
01:18:41,851 --> 01:18:44,684
I told them about baseball.

1520
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:45,846
You did?

1521
01:18:45,888 --> 01:18:47,719
Then I told them
about hot coffee.

1522
01:18:47,757 --> 01:18:49,384
You didn't? Did you really?

1523
01:18:49,425 --> 01:18:51,450
- Mr. Gordon.
- Yeah?

1524
01:18:51,494 --> 01:18:52,552
Congratulations.

1525
01:18:54,764 --> 01:18:55,753
Thank you.

1526
01:18:55,798 --> 01:18:57,356
I love you.

1527
01:19:05,374 --> 01:19:08,502
Aah!

1528
01:19:08,544 --> 01:19:09,533
- Aah!
- ¢Ü Sun is shinin' ¢Ü

1529
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:11,603

01:19:15,851 --> 01:19:18,081

1535
01:19:19,655 --> 01:19:23,216

01:19:23,259 --> 01:19:24,556

1537
01:19:24,593 --> 01:19:27,926

¢Ü See how the sun shines

¢Ü See how the sun shines

1540
01:19:32,234 --> 01:19:35,203
¢Ü On the streets

1541

1542
01:19:39,508 --> 01:19:41,635
¢Ü Hey, hey, hey ¢Ü

1543
01:19:41,677 --> 01:19:43,110
¢Ü Mr. Blue Sky ¢Ü

¢Ü So long ¢Ü

01:19:49,285 --> 01:19:51,412
¢Ü Where did we go wrong? ¢Ü

¢Ü Mr. Blue Sky ¢Ü

01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:55,484
¢Ü Please tell us why ¢Ü

1550
01:19:55,524 --> 01:19:59,119
¢Ü You had to hide away

1551
01:19:59,161 --> 01:20:00,185
¢Ü So long ¢Ü

1552
01:20:00,229 --> 01:20:01,992
¢Ü Where did we go wrong? ¢Ü

1553
01:20:03,766 --> 01:20:05,734
¢Ü Hey, you with pretty face ¢Ü

1554
01:20:05,768 --> 01:20:09,135
¢Ü Welcome to the human race ¢Ü

1555
01:20:09,171 --> 01:20:10,832
¢Ü A celebration ¢Ü

1556
01:20:10,873 --> 01:20:13,307
¢Ü Mr. Blue Sky's

1557
01:20:13,342 --> 01:20:17,574
¢Ü And today is the day

1558
01:20:17,613 --> 01:20:18,671
¢Ü Ah, ah, ah ¢Ü

1559
01:20:18,714 --> 01:20:19,048
We are
highlighting the search...

1560
01:20:19,048 --> 01:20:20,242
We are
highlighting the search...

1561
01:20:20,282 --> 01:20:24,116
for extra solar planets here
at the observatory.

1562
01:20:24,153 --> 01:20:26,451
And, well, as many of you know,
the Draco system...

1563
01:20:26,489 --> 01:20:29,219
is, uh, the prime focus
of the search.

1564
01:20:29,258 --> 01:20:30,850
And, well, who better
to talk about it...

1565
01:20:30,893 --> 01:20:33,987
<i>than David Gordon, whose
sci-fi best-seller Dracoban...</i>

1566
01:20:34,029 --> 01:20:37,897
has brought this exciting search
into the public eye.

1567
01:20:37,933 --> 01:20:38,991
David.

1568
01:20:39,034 --> 01:20:40,058
Thank you.

1569
01:20:41,103 --> 01:20:45,540
Um, let's see.

1570
01:20:45,574 --> 01:20:47,041
Uh, thank you.

1571
01:20:47,076 --> 01:20:49,408
I was fascinated
with seeing Draconis...

1572
01:20:49,445 --> 01:20:51,811
because it was a system...

1573
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:54,179
that could closely mirror
our solar system...

1574
01:20:54,216 --> 01:20:56,150
and might produce
a planet like Earth.

1575
01:20:56,185 --> 01:20:57,652
No planet has been...

1576
01:20:57,686 --> 01:21:01,019
the subject of more romantic
speculation than Mars.

1577
01:21:01,056 --> 01:21:03,547
At one point,
it was commonly believed...

1578
01:21:03,592 --> 01:21:06,755
that Mars was inhabited
by an ancient civilization...

1579
01:21:06,796 --> 01:21:09,890
that had dug an intricate
system of irrigation channels...

1580
01:21:09,932 --> 01:21:11,923
and the annual darkening
of the planet...

1581
01:21:11,967 --> 01:21:15,403
was interpreted as the growing
season of plant life.

1582
01:21:15,437 --> 01:21:18,838
<i>But the flyby missions
of Mariner IV, VI, and VII...</i>

1583
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:20,967
showed that
the irrigation system...

1584
01:21:21,010 --> 01:21:24,309
was nothing but an enormous
network of canyons...

1585
01:21:24,346 --> 01:21:27,338
and the famous darkening
due to annual dust storms.

1586
01:21:27,383 --> 01:21:30,648
<i>Soil samples taken
by the Viking landers...</i>

1587
01:21:30,686 --> 01:21:33,018
showed a complete absence
of organic material...

1588
01:21:33,055 --> 01:21:34,522
from the planet's surface.

1589
01:21:34,557 --> 01:21:37,583
In other words,
there is no life on Mars.

1590
01:21:40,196 --> 01:21:41,959
No planet
has been the subject...

1591
01:21:41,997 --> 01:21:44,989
of more romantic
speculation than Mars.

1592
01:21:45,034 --> 01:21:47,525
At one point,
it was commonly believed...

1593
01:21:47,570 --> 01:21:50,767
that Mars was inhabited
by an ancient civilization...

1594
01:21:50,806 --> 01:21:53,570
that had dug an intricate system
of irrigation channels...

1595
01:21:53,609 --> 01:21:55,907
and the annual darkening
of the planet...

1596
01:21:55,945 --> 01:21:58,937
was interpreted as the growing
season of plant life.

1597
01:21:58,981 --> 01:22:00,414
But the flyby missions...

1598
01:22:00,449 --> 01:22:02,747
This is not how I remember it.

1599
01:22:02,785 --> 01:22:05,151
...showed that the irrigation system...
- This isn't it.

1600
01:22:05,187 --> 01:22:07,781
Was nothing but an enormous
network of canyons...

1601
01:22:07,823 --> 01:22:11,224
and the famous darkening
due to annual dust storms.

1602
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:13,125
Soil samples taken by...

1603
01:22:13,162 --> 01:22:16,689
I think
I'm from a different Mars.

1604
01:22:21,637 --> 01:22:23,332
Are you angry with me?

1605
01:22:23,372 --> 01:22:25,670
No, I'm not angry with you,
I just thought we agreed...

1606
01:22:25,708 --> 01:22:28,302
that you weren't...

1607
01:22:28,344 --> 01:22:29,606
gonna be from Mars.

1608
01:22:29,645 --> 01:22:31,408
I can't even say
that word anymore.

1609
01:22:32,815 --> 01:22:35,807
I thought I was pretending
so we could stay together.

1610
01:22:35,851 --> 01:22:38,342
No. Come on, pal.

1611
01:22:39,622 --> 01:22:41,317
You don't believe
I am from Mars...

1612
01:22:41,357 --> 01:22:42,415
- do you?
- Oh, come on, Dennis...

1613
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:45,325
I think that sometimes
you think you are, okay?

1614
01:22:45,361 --> 01:22:46,828
Stop!

1615
01:22:46,862 --> 01:22:47,886
No, no. You stop, Dennis.

1616
01:22:47,930 --> 01:22:48,988
- I mean, it's...
- The car!

1617
01:22:56,538 --> 01:22:58,130
I'm so sorry, officer.

1618
01:22:58,173 --> 01:22:59,765
I was having a conversation
with my son...

1619
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:01,241
and I didn't...
I turned the corner.

1620
01:23:01,277 --> 01:23:02,710
I'm really sorry.

1621
01:23:02,745 --> 01:23:04,042
Driver's license, please.

1622
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:05,774
I usually have it right here.

1623
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:06,838
Um...

1624
01:23:09,318 --> 01:23:11,411
Dennis, did you take
my driver's license?

1625
01:23:12,922 --> 01:23:14,856
<i>Freena wobbly meetya.</i>

1626
01:23:16,725 --> 01:23:17,953
Dennis, I'm asking you
a question.

1627
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:19,290
I need you to answer me.

1628
01:23:19,328 --> 01:23:20,886
Did you take
my driver's license?

1629
01:23:20,930 --> 01:23:22,557
This is serious, okay?

1630
01:23:22,598 --> 01:23:24,225
<i>Freena wobbly meetya.</i>

1631
01:23:24,266 --> 01:23:26,791
Dennis! Answer the question!

1632
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:29,326
<i>Freena wobbly meetya.</i>

1633
01:23:29,371 --> 01:23:30,565
Dennis, you took my license!

1634
01:23:30,606 --> 01:23:32,267
No, I didn't!

1635
01:23:33,409 --> 01:23:34,569
Dennis!

1636
01:23:36,078 --> 01:23:38,171
I didn't steal it!

1637
01:23:46,322 --> 01:23:47,812
What did you do
with her pictures?

1638
01:23:47,856 --> 01:23:50,086
I didn't steal 'em.
I need them.

1639
01:23:50,125 --> 01:23:51,524
Oh, come on, man!

1640
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:53,118
That's not fair!

1641
01:23:53,162 --> 01:23:54,527
We talked about all this!

1642
01:23:54,563 --> 01:23:55,791
Stop. Those are mine.

1643
01:23:55,831 --> 01:23:57,162
It's not your stuff, Dennis!

1644
01:23:57,199 --> 01:23:58,996
It's my stuff!

1645
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:00,467
Stop.

1646
01:24:00,502 --> 01:24:04,097
Dennis, adults
get their feelings hurt...

1647
01:24:04,139 --> 01:24:05,629
just like little boys.

1648
01:24:05,674 --> 01:24:07,574
This is my stuff.

1649
01:24:08,777 --> 01:24:10,244
Stop.

1650
01:24:10,279 --> 01:24:11,837
No!

1651
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:12,938
Stop!

1652
01:24:19,621 --> 01:24:21,179
Go ahead.

1653
01:24:21,223 --> 01:24:23,248
Go ahead.

1654
01:24:23,292 --> 01:24:24,350
Why don't you?

1655
01:24:27,796 --> 01:24:29,354
<i>Trans fobo medio.</i>

1656
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:31,093
<i>Trans fobo medio.</i>

1657
01:24:31,133 --> 01:24:32,122
<i>Trans fobo medio.</i>

1658
01:24:32,167 --> 01:24:33,156

<i>- Dennis, Dennis.

1674
01:24:52,454 --> 01:24:54,752
<i>- Dennis, Dennis, stop.
- Trans fobo medio.</i>

1675
01:24:54,790 --> 01:24:58,317
You're not a Martian.
You're just a little boy.

1676
01:25:03,866 --> 01:25:04,890
And maybe I can't help you.

1677
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:06,491
Maybe I'm not cut out for this.

1678
01:25:10,973 --> 01:25:14,033
Stay here and just...
Just cool out for a minute.

1679
01:25:30,959 --> 01:25:32,517
Look, it's just
gonna be like, you know...

1680
01:25:32,561 --> 01:25:33,550
I'm gonna show my face
for twenty minutes...

1681
01:25:33,595 --> 01:25:34,926
- Yeah.
- Hey, no.

1682
01:25:34,963 --> 01:25:36,430
- Then get back on the road.
- No, take your time.

1683
01:25:36,465 --> 01:25:37,454
Take your time.

1684
01:25:37,499 --> 01:25:38,830
Do what you gotta do,
you know?

1685
01:25:38,867 --> 01:25:39,856
Don't worry about us.

1686
01:25:39,902 --> 01:25:40,891
Okay.

1687
01:25:40,936 --> 01:25:41,960
It'll be great.

1688
01:25:42,004 --> 01:25:43,631
Thanks for watching him.

1689
01:25:43,672 --> 01:25:44,969
Oh. It's...

1690
01:25:46,041 --> 01:25:47,269
You're my brother.

1691
01:25:48,510 --> 01:25:50,171
He's my nephew.

1692
01:25:55,684 --> 01:25:57,413
Dennis?

1693
01:25:57,453 --> 01:25:59,648
Hey, wow. That is cool.

1694
01:25:59,688 --> 01:26:02,589
Listen, I'm gonna finish
cleaning up the kitchen...

1695
01:26:02,624 --> 01:26:05,092
and call Nicholas and Jonas
and check in on them...

1696
01:26:05,127 --> 01:26:06,822
and I thought
then I can come back...

1697
01:26:06,862 --> 01:26:09,092
and hang out, okay?

1698
01:26:09,131 --> 01:26:11,190
All right, big guy?

1699
01:26:11,233 --> 01:26:12,359
I'll be back.

1700
01:26:15,771 --> 01:26:17,102
Congratulations.

1701
01:26:17,139 --> 01:26:18,572
Who is this handsome fellow?

1702
01:26:18,607 --> 01:26:20,006
I look like Chairman Mao.

1703
01:26:20,042 --> 01:26:21,976
That's right. You brought
your Little Red Book.

1704
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:24,137
- Oh, that's hideous.
- Louie. Louis?

1705
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:25,646
Louie, right here, snappy snap.

1706
01:26:29,351 --> 01:26:32,013
Welcome to the big time,
Mr. Gordon.

1707
01:26:32,054 --> 01:26:35,148
Tina. So excited.

1708
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:36,452
- I was wondering about you.
- So lovely to see you.

1709
01:26:36,492 --> 01:26:37,720
Ah, you wouldn't be the first.

1710
01:26:38,794 --> 01:26:42,059
Everybody,
this is David Gordon...

1711
01:26:42,097 --> 01:26:44,429
and he is brilliant.

1712
01:26:49,271 --> 01:26:51,205
And I see he's brought
me a little present.

1713
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:53,902
This is the first draft
of his new book.

1714
01:26:53,942 --> 01:26:55,739
And let me tell you,
it did not come cheap.

1715
01:26:58,313 --> 01:26:59,302
- Ah, David.
- Yeah?

1716
01:26:59,348 --> 01:27:00,975
I'd like to introduce you
to Leonard.

1717
01:27:01,016 --> 01:27:02,779
He's the head of our marketing.

1718
01:27:02,818 --> 01:27:04,217
Nice to meet you.

1719
01:27:04,253 --> 01:27:05,379
He's absolutely brilliant.

1720
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:06,978
- Yeah?
- Welcome to the club.

1721
01:27:07,022 --> 01:27:09,183
Tina likes to surround herself
with brilliant people.

1722
01:27:09,224 --> 01:27:11,021
I can see that.

1723
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:13,687
Well, shall we just give
this manuscript...

1724
01:27:13,729 --> 01:27:15,720
to my assistant
for safekeeping?

1725
01:27:15,764 --> 01:27:17,026
Linus.

1726
01:27:17,065 --> 01:27:18,692
Tina, actually,
could I speak with you...

1727
01:27:18,734 --> 01:27:20,065
in private for a moment?

1728
01:27:20,102 --> 01:27:22,900
There's just... I have something
I need to talk to you about.

1729
01:27:24,106 --> 01:27:26,802
Uh, listen, this might be
a little awkward.

1730
01:27:26,842 --> 01:27:28,571
That's my least favorite word.

1731
01:27:28,610 --> 01:27:29,872
I'm sure.

1732
01:27:29,912 --> 01:27:31,311
Uh, well, could you
take a look at this?

1733
01:27:31,346 --> 01:27:33,644
I just want to talk to you
'cause it's a little...

1734
01:27:33,682 --> 01:27:35,946
different situation here
than I imagined.

1735
01:27:35,984 --> 01:27:37,315
<i>- Martian Child?
- Mm-Hmm.</i>

1736
01:27:37,352 --> 01:27:38,444
What's this?

1737
01:27:38,487 --> 01:27:39,476
Is that the alternate, uh...

1738
01:27:39,521 --> 01:27:40,510
alternate title idea, buddy?

1739
01:27:40,556 --> 01:27:42,615
<i>I thought we agreed
on The Revenge of Dracoban.</i>

1740
01:27:42,658 --> 01:27:43,852
Yes. Yes, we did.

1741
01:27:43,892 --> 01:27:45,052
Um...

1742
01:27:46,295 --> 01:27:49,458
but I must say it's more
than just a title change.

1743
01:27:49,498 --> 01:27:52,262
So this is the, um,
quantum alternate universe?

1744
01:27:52,301 --> 01:27:53,461
Shut up.

1745
01:27:53,502 --> 01:27:54,491
An idea that...

1746
01:27:54,536 --> 01:27:55,525
<i>I tried to write Dracoban.</i>

1747
01:27:55,571 --> 01:27:56,595
I really, really, really did.

1748
01:27:57,673 --> 01:27:58,662
Well, what's the problem?

1749
01:27:58,707 --> 01:28:00,368
I adopted a boy.

1750
01:28:00,409 --> 01:28:05,847
Adopted this very fantastic,
difficult young man...

1751
01:28:05,881 --> 01:28:07,075
and he is very much alive...

1752
01:28:07,115 --> 01:28:08,776
and those characters were dead,
and I had to do this.

1753
01:28:08,817 --> 01:28:11,047
- No, we have a contract.
- Uh-huh.

1754
01:28:11,086 --> 01:28:13,316
We paid you
a substantial amount.

1755
01:28:13,355 --> 01:28:14,754
I know, I know,
I know, I know.

1756
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:16,382
And I'll, um, ahem...

1757
01:28:16,425 --> 01:28:18,791
I'll write the other one,
or I'll just pay you back.

1758
01:28:18,827 --> 01:28:20,317
It's unacceptable.

1759
01:28:20,362 --> 01:28:21,386
I'll refinance my house
if that's what it takes.

1760
01:28:21,430 --> 01:28:22,419
I don't care.

1761
01:28:22,464 --> 01:28:23,795
I don't want the money.

1762
01:28:23,832 --> 01:28:25,891
I want
a Harry bloody Potter in space.

1763
01:28:25,934 --> 01:28:27,799
That's what I paid for.

1764
01:28:27,836 --> 01:28:30,236
Leonard created
an extremely expensive...

1765
01:28:30,272 --> 01:28:32,502
marketing campaign
around this book...

1766
01:28:32,541 --> 01:28:35,339
<i>and Dracoban is the cornerstone
of that campaign.</i>

1767
01:28:37,045 --> 01:28:39,172
I can't do anything
without that.

1768
01:28:39,214 --> 01:28:43,617
Do you comprehend
what I am telling you?

1769
01:28:43,652 --> 01:28:44,641
You get that, don't you, buddy?

1770
01:28:44,686 --> 01:28:45,846
Do you understand that?

1771
01:28:47,556 --> 01:28:51,515
Why can't you just be
what we want you to be?

1772
01:29:05,941 --> 01:29:07,909
Mmm...

1773
01:29:07,943 --> 01:29:09,035
I got it.

1774
01:29:10,178 --> 01:29:12,738
Beware. Beware. Beware.

1775
01:29:14,383 --> 01:29:16,783
What time is it?
I'm so sorry.

1776
01:29:16,818 --> 01:29:17,978
I'm gonna write the other thing.

1777
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:20,454
I'm gonna make
this up to you, I promise.

1778
01:29:20,489 --> 01:29:22,855
You're gonna get a whole series,
rivers of blood...

1779
01:29:22,891 --> 01:29:24,222
but just read that
because it's good.

1780
01:29:24,259 --> 01:29:25,419
It's really good.

1781
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:27,519
And I have to go,
but this was great...

1782
01:29:27,562 --> 01:29:28,824
and I'm sorry.

1783
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:40,970
Hey, Dennis!

1784
01:29:41,009 --> 01:29:43,341
What do you say, um...

1785
01:29:43,378 --> 01:29:48,145
to some hot chocolate
or... or somethin'?

1786
01:29:48,183 --> 01:29:50,174
Does that sound kinda good?

1787
01:29:51,687 --> 01:29:54,622
Or... Tang?

1788
01:29:54,656 --> 01:29:57,181
Do you know what Tang is?

1789
01:29:57,225 --> 01:30:00,786
It's... It's something
that the astronauts drink.

1790
01:30:00,829 --> 01:30:01,887
Might like that.

1791
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:21,345
Liz!

1792
01:30:25,486 --> 01:30:27,147
Liz!

1793
01:30:27,187 --> 01:30:28,415
Liz!

1794
01:30:28,455 --> 01:30:29,683
- We just...
- What happened?

1795
01:30:29,723 --> 01:30:31,054
We just can't find him.

1796
01:30:31,091 --> 01:30:32,251
You can't find him?

1797
01:30:32,292 --> 01:30:33,452
He was fine.
Everything was fine.

1798
01:30:33,494 --> 01:30:35,325
He was in his room,
and l... I went to get him...

1799
01:30:35,362 --> 01:30:36,386
- some hot chocolate.
- It's okay, it's okay.

1800
01:30:36,430 --> 01:30:37,897
It's okay. It's okay.

1801
01:30:37,931 --> 01:30:38,920
Then we
just called the police...

1802
01:30:38,966 --> 01:30:39,990
- just to make sure.
- Where... Where's...

1803
01:30:40,033 --> 01:30:41,660
Where's the last place
you saw him?

1804
01:30:50,377 --> 01:30:51,742
He's nowhere in the house.

1805
01:30:51,779 --> 01:30:54,270
Are you sure?
You checked everywhere?

1806
01:31:07,528 --> 01:31:09,860
It's so beautiful.

1807
01:31:09,897 --> 01:31:12,263
Maybe he is a little Mozart.

1808
01:31:18,038 --> 01:31:19,369
What does it mean?

1809
01:31:22,876 --> 01:31:24,002
Means goodbye.

1810
01:31:25,312 --> 01:31:27,678
Hey, Harlee, just stay there.
Stay in the car, okay?

1811
01:31:27,714 --> 01:31:29,113
Did you find him?

1812
01:31:29,149 --> 01:31:31,242
No, no, but I know where to go.
Can you drive me?

1813
01:31:31,285 --> 01:31:32,309
- Yes.
- All right.

1814
01:31:32,352 --> 01:31:35,082
- I can get the police
to move their car.

1815
01:31:35,122 --> 01:31:36,111
- No. Don't worry about it.

1816
01:31:36,156 --> 01:31:37,145
- Okay.
- Okay.

1817
01:31:37,191 --> 01:31:38,180
All right. Call me.

1818
01:31:38,225 --> 01:31:40,693
Put your seat belts on!

1819
01:31:46,967 --> 01:31:47,991
- You go that way, and I'll...
- David.

1820
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:54,805
Talk to him.
Go, go, go, go.

1821
01:31:57,344 --> 01:31:58,743
Dennis, stay where you are!

1822
01:31:58,779 --> 01:32:01,145
David's coming to get you...

1823
01:32:01,181 --> 01:32:03,172
so just don't move, okay?

1824
01:32:32,846 --> 01:32:34,245
Don't... Really,
just don't walk, sweetie.

1825
01:32:34,281 --> 01:32:36,374
You gotta just try
to stay still.

1826
01:32:42,856 --> 01:32:44,221
Dennis.

1827
01:32:49,396 --> 01:32:50,954
Dennis?

1828
01:32:50,998 --> 01:32:52,260
Dennis. Dennis, stop movin'.

1829
01:32:52,299 --> 01:32:53,493
Here I come.

1830
01:32:53,533 --> 01:32:54,864
Dennis, I'm comin' to get you.

1831
01:32:54,902 --> 01:32:58,133
Just... Just... Just stay still.
Please, please.

1832
01:32:58,171 --> 01:33:00,230
Dennis, stop movin'.

1833
01:33:00,274 --> 01:33:01,866
They're here.

1834
01:33:04,645 --> 01:33:08,012
Dennis, hold on, pal!
I'm comin'!

1835
01:33:08,048 --> 01:33:10,676
Why are you here?

1836
01:33:10,717 --> 01:33:13,515
You can't come with me.

1837
01:33:13,553 --> 01:33:14,611
Okay.

1838
01:33:14,655 --> 01:33:16,179
Shh.

1839
01:33:18,792 --> 01:33:20,350
Give me your hand.
I'm gonna take you home.

1840
01:33:20,394 --> 01:33:24,262
No. I have to go back now.

1841
01:33:25,565 --> 01:33:26,759
My mission is over.

1842
01:33:28,936 --> 01:33:29,960
Dennis, stop.

1843
01:33:30,003 --> 01:33:32,233
Please stop moving.

1844
01:33:33,740 --> 01:33:37,005
They're here.
They came back for me.

1845
01:33:37,044 --> 01:33:38,033
It's a helicopter, Dennis.

1846
01:33:38,078 --> 01:33:39,306
We've all been lookin' for you.

1847
01:33:39,346 --> 01:33:41,906
It's not a helicopter.
It's not.

1848
01:33:44,985 --> 01:33:46,885
Okay.
Dennis, give me your hand.

1849
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:47,978
I'm gonna take you home.

1850
01:33:48,021 --> 01:33:50,421
<i>I am going home.</i>

1851
01:33:50,457 --> 01:33:52,254
I don't belong here.

1852
01:33:52,292 --> 01:33:53,657
Okay.

1853
01:33:59,566 --> 01:34:01,591
Put the suitcase down...

1854
01:34:01,635 --> 01:34:04,729
and hold onto the edges
really tight...

1855
01:34:04,771 --> 01:34:07,331
and I'll wait with you
until they come, okay?

1856
01:34:19,052 --> 01:34:20,713
I'm sorry, David.

1857
01:34:22,389 --> 01:34:24,357
What are you sorry about?

1858
01:34:24,391 --> 01:34:27,189
I'm sorry
that I have to leave...

1859
01:34:27,227 --> 01:34:32,995
but I'll tell them
about baseball...

1860
01:34:33,033 --> 01:34:34,967
and Lucky Charms...

1861
01:34:37,404 --> 01:34:39,668
and Flomar.

1862
01:34:39,706 --> 01:34:43,938
Yeah. You can tell 'em
about all the stuff we did...

1863
01:34:43,977 --> 01:34:45,672
and how much fun we had.

1864
01:34:49,483 --> 01:34:50,848
Dennis, look at me.

1865
01:34:50,884 --> 01:34:52,010
Tell 'em about
all the fun stuff we did...

1866
01:34:52,052 --> 01:34:54,612
and, you know,
how much fun we had.

1867
01:34:54,654 --> 01:34:58,613
You can tell 'em
how hard you tried...

1868
01:34:58,658 --> 01:35:00,592
you know, to fit in,
to be like all of us.

1869
01:35:02,462 --> 01:35:05,989
Human beings
can be kinda cruel...

1870
01:35:06,033 --> 01:35:07,057
huh?

1871
01:35:11,171 --> 01:35:14,470
I promise I'll tell 'em
you were nice to me.

1872
01:35:14,508 --> 01:35:15,634
Thanks.

1873
01:35:18,478 --> 01:35:19,740
You're a great human, Dennis.

1874
01:35:19,780 --> 01:35:21,111
That's the funny part...

1875
01:35:21,148 --> 01:35:23,673
and I just wanted you to feel
like you belong to me...

1876
01:35:23,717 --> 01:35:24,706
'cause that's what I think...

1877
01:35:24,751 --> 01:35:26,412
you really want
underneath all this.

1878
01:35:26,453 --> 01:35:28,148
I think you want
to belong to someone.

1879
01:35:31,958 --> 01:35:34,586
I wish we could have
more time together.

1880
01:35:34,628 --> 01:35:35,822
I want to prove to you...

1881
01:35:35,862 --> 01:35:37,796
that not all parents
disappear forever.

1882
01:35:45,205 --> 01:35:47,901
Why do they go sometimes?

1883
01:35:50,477 --> 01:35:52,240
I don't know. That's a...

1884
01:35:57,050 --> 01:35:58,244
I don't know.

1885
01:35:58,285 --> 01:35:59,582
That's a mystery.

1886
01:35:59,619 --> 01:36:01,746
Sometimes it's their fault,
and sometimes it's not.

1887
01:36:01,788 --> 01:36:03,779
It's a... It's a mystery.
I don't know.

1888
01:36:17,671 --> 01:36:20,162
Why? Why?

1889
01:36:21,708 --> 01:36:24,438
Why do you think they left me?

1890
01:36:42,162 --> 01:36:43,823
Because...

1891
01:36:46,700 --> 01:36:48,099
Because they were stupid!

1892
01:36:48,135 --> 01:36:49,762
Whoever let you go...

1893
01:36:49,803 --> 01:36:52,294
those were the stupidest beings
in the universe.

1894
01:36:52,339 --> 01:36:53,670
I mean, they were so dumb...

1895
01:36:53,707 --> 01:36:56,540
they couldn't even see
what was right in front of 'em.

1896
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:58,806
How could they not see
how extraordinary you are...

1897
01:36:58,845 --> 01:37:00,142
how big your heart is?

1898
01:37:03,116 --> 01:37:05,084
I'm not even that smart,
and I can see it.

1899
01:37:05,118 --> 01:37:07,416
It's so obvious.

1900
01:37:07,454 --> 01:37:09,445
I mean, you're the easiest kid
in the world to love.

1901
01:37:09,489 --> 01:37:11,184
Well, to me, you are.

1902
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:14,759
You know what I think?

1903
01:37:16,897 --> 01:37:18,922
I think you love me, too.

1904
01:37:20,233 --> 01:37:21,461
Like you're
just filled with it.

1905
01:37:22,602 --> 01:37:24,968
Think it's just waiting
to burst out of you.

1906
01:37:28,575 --> 01:37:30,736
Dennis, you're my son.

1907
01:37:30,777 --> 01:37:33,644
You're my home, forever.

1908
01:37:34,648 --> 01:37:37,981
And I will
never, ever, ever...

1909
01:37:38,018 --> 01:37:40,714
ever, ever...

1910
01:37:40,754 --> 01:37:43,780
ever, ever, ever...

1911
01:37:45,225 --> 01:37:46,590
leave you.

1912
01:37:52,098 --> 01:37:53,497
Okay.

1913
01:37:53,533 --> 01:37:54,727
I got you.

1914
01:37:56,403 --> 01:37:57,927
I got you.

1915
01:37:58,972 --> 01:38:00,337
I got you.

1916
01:38:05,712 --> 01:38:08,203
Hey, Dennis,
I got my Martian wish.

1917
01:38:13,220 --> 01:38:15,279
Oh, my God.

1918
01:38:15,322 --> 01:38:16,482
It's okay.

1919
01:38:18,758 --> 01:38:19,816
"Sometimes we forget...

1920
01:38:19,859 --> 01:38:22,225
"that children have
just arrived on the earth.

1921
01:38:22,262 --> 01:38:24,890
"They are a little like aliens
coming into being...

1922
01:38:24,931 --> 01:38:27,161
"as bundles of energy
and pure potential...

1923
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:29,259
"here on some kind
of exploratory mission...

1924
01:38:29,302 --> 01:38:30,769
"and they're
just trying to learn...

1925
01:38:30,804 --> 01:38:32,271
"what it means to be human."

1926
01:38:33,473 --> 01:38:35,498
"For some reason, Dennis and I
reached out into the universe...

1927
01:38:35,542 --> 01:38:36,941
