1
00:02:01,644 --> 00:02:03,801
- Captain.
- Yes, sir?

2
00:02:03,936 --> 00:02:06,057
Tell them we wish
to board at once.

3
00:02:07,563 --> 00:02:08,973
With all due respect...

4
00:02:09,105 --> 00:02:12,306
the ambassadors for the supreme
chancellor wish to board immediately.

5
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,312
Yes, of course.

6
00:02:14,441 --> 00:02:17,523
As you know,
our blockade isperfectly legal...

7
00:02:17,651 --> 00:02:21,728
and we'd be happy
to receive the ambassadors.

8
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:46,824
I'm TC-1 4 at your service.

9
00:02:46,957 --> 00:02:48,829
This way, please.

10
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,994
We are greatly honoured
by your visit, Ambassadors.

11
00:02:58,128 --> 00:03:00,000
Make yourselves comfortable.

12
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:02,453
My master
will be with you shortly.

13
00:03:06,341 --> 00:03:08,628
I have a bad feeling about this.

14
00:03:08,758 --> 00:03:11,757
- I don't sense anything.
- It's not about the mission, Master.

15
00:03:11,885 --> 00:03:15,797
It's something elsewhere, elusive.

16
00:03:15,928 --> 00:03:18,298
Don't centre on your anxieties,
Obi-Wan.

17
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:21,548
Keep your concentration here and now,
where it belongs.

18
00:03:21,681 --> 00:03:24,514
But Master Yoda said
I should be mindful of the future.

19
00:03:24,641 --> 00:03:26,632
But not at the expense
of the moment.

20
00:03:26,767 --> 00:03:29,682
Be mindful of the living Force,
young Padawan.

21
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,718
Yes, Master.

22
00:03:33,937 --> 00:03:37,553
How do you think this trade viceroy
will deal with the chancellor's demands?

23
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:39,810
These Federation types are cowards.

24
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,773
The negotiations will be short.

25
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,186
What? What did you say?

26
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:49,270
The ambassadors areJedi knights,
I believe.

27
00:03:50,028 --> 00:03:51,225
I knew it.

28
00:03:51,362 --> 00:03:53,602
They're here to force a settlement.

29
00:03:54,947 --> 00:03:58,029
Distract them.
I will contact Lord Sidious.

30
00:03:58,157 --> 00:03:59,733
Are you brain-dead?

31
00:03:59,866 --> 00:04:02,699
I'm not going in there
with two Jedi.

32
00:04:04,368 --> 00:04:05,778
Send a droid.

33
00:04:11,246 --> 00:04:13,118
Is it in their nature
to make us wait this long?

34
00:04:13,247 --> 00:04:15,534
No. I sense
an unusual amount of fear...

35
00:04:15,665 --> 00:04:17,786
for something as trivial
as this trade dispute.

36
00:04:28,713 --> 00:04:30,585
What is it?

37
00:04:30,714 --> 00:04:33,381
This scheme of yours has failed,
Lord Sidious.

38
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:37,039
The blockade is finished.
We dare not go against these Jedi.

39
00:04:37,175 --> 00:04:41,964
Viceroy, I don't want
this stuntedslime in my sight again.

40
00:04:43,345 --> 00:04:47,387
This turn of events is unfortunate.
We must accelerate our plans.

41
00:04:47,513 --> 00:04:50,049
Begin landing your troops.

42
00:04:50,181 --> 00:04:53,879
My lord, is that legal?

43
00:04:54,016 --> 00:04:56,303
I will make it legal.

44
00:04:56,434 --> 00:04:58,721
And the Jedi?

45
00:04:58,852 --> 00:05:01,341
The chancellor should never have
brought them into this.

46
00:05:01,478 --> 00:05:03,220
Kill them immediately.

47
00:05:03,354 --> 00:05:07,645
Yes, my lord.
As you wish.

48
00:05:09,524 --> 00:05:11,314
Captain, look!

49
00:05:12,442 --> 00:05:13,816
Shields--

50
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:19,191
Sorry.

51
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:22,818
Dioxis.

52
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:30,271
They must be dead by now.

53
00:05:30,409 --> 00:05:33,076
Destroy what's left ofthem.

54
00:05:41,205 --> 00:05:43,575
Oh! Excuse me.

55
00:05:43,706 --> 00:05:46,658
-Check it out, Corporal. We'll cover you.
-Roger, roger.

56
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,284
Uh-oh. Blast them.

57
00:05:55,045 --> 00:05:56,586
What is going on down there?

58
00:05:56,713 --> 00:05:58,669
We lost the transmission, sir.

59
00:06:03,174 --> 00:06:06,173
Have you ever encountered
a Jedi knight before, sir?

60
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,252
Well, no, but I don't--
Seal off the bridge.

61
00:06:09,385 --> 00:06:12,088
- Yes, sir.
- That won't be enough, sir.

62
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,176
I want droidekas
up here at once!

63
00:06:14,304 --> 00:06:16,840
We will not survive this.

64
00:06:28,394 --> 00:06:29,804
Close the blast doors!

65
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,597
That will hold them.

66
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,773
They are still coming through.

67
00:06:49,904 --> 00:06:51,812
This is impossible!

68
00:06:56,324 --> 00:06:59,157
Where are those droidekas?

69
00:07:00,743 --> 00:07:02,485
Master! Destroyers!

70
00:07:08,913 --> 00:07:10,287
They have shield generators!

71
00:07:11,748 --> 00:07:14,451
It's a standoff.
Let's go.

72
00:07:18,626 --> 00:07:21,115
They're no match for droidekas.

73
00:07:21,252 --> 00:07:22,911
Sir!

74
00:07:23,045 --> 00:07:25,712
They've gone up
the ventilation shaft.

75
00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:37,176
- Battle droids.
- It's an invasion army.

76
00:07:38,927 --> 00:07:41,594
This is an odd play
for the Trade Federation.

77
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,802
We've got to warn the Naboo
and contact Chancellor Valorum.

78
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,471
Let's split up.

79
00:07:46,598 --> 00:07:49,799
Stow aboard separate ships
and meet down on the planet.

80
00:07:49,933 --> 00:07:51,758
You were right
about one thing, Master.

81
00:07:53,726 --> 00:07:56,393
The negotiations were short.

82
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,967
Sir, a transmission
from the planet.

83
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:02,178
It's Queen Amidala herself.

84
00:08:02,313 --> 00:08:04,719
At last we are getting results.

85
00:08:06,107 --> 00:08:09,106
Again you come before us,
Your Highness.

86
00:08:09,233 --> 00:08:12,315
You will not be so pleased when you hear
what l have tosay, Viceroy.

87
00:08:12,443 --> 00:08:16,141
Your trade boycott
of our planet has ended.

88
00:08:16,278 --> 00:08:18,814
I was not aware of such failure.

89
00:08:18,946 --> 00:08:21,649
I have word that the chancellor's
ambassadors are with you now...

90
00:08:21,781 --> 00:08:24,484
and thatyou have been commanded
to reach settlement.

91
00:08:24,616 --> 00:08:26,856
I know nothing
of any ambassadors.

92
00:08:26,992 --> 00:08:29,362
You must be mistaken.

93
00:08:29,493 --> 00:08:31,484
Beware, Viceroy.

94
00:08:31,619 --> 00:08:34,322
The Federation
hasgone too farthis time.

95
00:08:34,454 --> 00:08:38,496
We would never do anything
without the approval of the senate.

96
00:08:38,622 --> 00:08:41,111
You assume too much.

97
00:08:41,248 --> 00:08:42,622
We will see.

98
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:48,245
- She's right. The senate will never--
- It's too late now.

99
00:08:48,377 --> 00:08:51,329
- Do you think she suspects an attack?
- I don't know.

100
00:08:51,462 --> 00:08:55,789
But we must move quickly to disrupt
all communications down there.

101
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:05,046
Negotiations haven't started
because the ambassadors aren't there?

102
00:09:05,176 --> 00:09:07,333
How could that be true?

103
00:09:07,469 --> 00:09:11,796
I have assurances from the chancellor
his ambassadors did arrive.

104
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:15,676
It must-- handiwork--
negotiate--ambassadors--

105
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:18,425
-nobody would--
- Senator Palpatine.

106
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,430
What's happening?

107
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:22,431
Check the transmission generator.

108
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,385
A communications disruption
can mean only one thing: invasion.

109
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,807
The Federation
would not dare go that far.

110
00:09:29,938 --> 00:09:33,719
The senate would revoke their trade
franchise, and they'd be finished.

111
00:09:33,857 --> 00:09:36,690
We must continue to rely
on negotiation.

112
00:09:36,816 --> 00:09:40,017
Negotiation?
We've lost all communications.

113
00:09:40,151 --> 00:09:42,475
And where are
the chancellor's ambassadors?

114
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,274
This is a dangerous situation,
Your Highness.

115
00:09:46,404 --> 00:09:48,478
Our security volunteers
will be no match...

116
00:09:48,613 --> 00:09:50,734
against a battle-hardened
Federation army.

117
00:09:52,324 --> 00:09:56,022
I will not condone a course of action
that will lead us to war.

118
00:10:32,467 --> 00:10:35,549
- Yes, Viceroy?
- Captain, we've searched the ship...

119
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:37,798
and there is no trace of the Jedi.

120
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:40,678
They may have gotten on
one of your landing craft.

121
00:10:40,805 --> 00:10:43,259
If they're down here, sir,
we'll find them.

122
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:47,716
Use caution.
These Jedi are not to be underestimated.

123
00:11:01,523 --> 00:11:03,313
- Oh, no!
- Get away! Get out of here!

124
00:11:04,232 --> 00:11:06,140
Get down!

125
00:11:16,155 --> 00:11:19,024
Was'n dat?
Hey, wait!

126
00:11:19,948 --> 00:11:21,690
Oh, mooie-mooie,
I love you.

127
00:11:21,824 --> 00:11:23,862
You almost got us killed.
Are you brainless?

128
00:11:23,992 --> 00:11:25,615
I spake.

129
00:11:25,743 --> 00:11:27,864
The ability to speak
does not make you intelligent.

130
00:11:27,994 --> 00:11:30,863
- Now, get out of here.
- No, no, mesa stay.

131
00:11:30,995 --> 00:11:34,029
Mesa culled Jar Jar Binks.
Mesa your humble servant.

132
00:11:34,163 --> 00:11:36,237
- That won't be necessary.
- Oh, but it 'tis.

133
00:11:36,373 --> 00:11:39,242
'Tis demanded by the gods, it 'tis.

134
00:11:39,374 --> 00:11:41,282
- Oh, no!
- Stay down!

135
00:11:49,629 --> 00:11:51,371
You saved my again.

136
00:11:51,505 --> 00:11:53,377
- What's this?
- A local.

137
00:11:53,506 --> 00:11:56,042
Let's get out of here
before more droids show up.

138
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:59,541
More?
"More" did you spake?

139
00:11:59,675 --> 00:12:04,548
Ex-squeeze-me, but de mostest
safest place would be Gunga City.

140
00:12:04,678 --> 00:12:07,879
Is where I grew up.
'Tis a hidden city.

141
00:12:09,513 --> 00:12:11,385
- A city?
- Uh-huh.

142
00:12:11,514 --> 00:12:13,304
Can you take us there?

143
00:12:13,849 --> 00:12:15,639
On second thought, no.

144
00:12:15,766 --> 00:12:18,255
- Not really, no.
- No?

145
00:12:18,392 --> 00:12:20,513
'Tis embarrassing...

146
00:12:20,643 --> 00:12:24,590
but my afraid
my've been banished.

147
00:12:24,729 --> 00:12:27,811
My forgotten. Da bosses
would do terrible tings to me.

148
00:12:27,939 --> 00:12:30,973
Terrible tings to me
if me goen back dare.

149
00:12:31,107 --> 00:12:34,106
- You hear that?
- Yah.

150
00:12:34,233 --> 00:12:37,979
That is the sound of a thousand
terrible things heading this way.

151
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,682
If they find us,
they will crush us...

152
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:45,360
grind us into tiny pieces
and blast us into oblivion.

153
00:12:45,488 --> 00:12:47,195
Oh.

154
00:12:47,323 --> 00:12:49,397
Yousa point is well seen.

155
00:12:49,532 --> 00:12:51,856
Dis way. Hurry!

156
00:12:57,161 --> 00:13:00,444
- How much further?
- Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?

157
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:02,451
Ah, my warning you.

158
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:06,705
Gungans no liken outsiders,
so don't spect a warm welcome.

159
00:13:06,832 --> 00:13:10,163
Don't worry. This hasn't been
our day for warm welcomes.

160
00:13:20,588 --> 00:13:22,994
Yousa follow me now, okeyday?

161
00:14:08,277 --> 00:14:11,192
So good bein home!

00:14:27,578 --> 00:14:30,150
Hey, yousa.

Yousa goen tada bosses.

00:14:46,212 --> 00:14:47,788
How wude.

168
00:14:56,425 --> 00:14:58,831
Yousa cannot bees hair.

169
00:14:58,968 --> 00:15:03,508
Dis army of Mackineeks
up dare is new weesong.

170
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:08,510
A droid army is about to attack
the Naboo. We must warn them.

171
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,219
Wesa no like da Naboo.

172
00:15:12,349 --> 00:15:15,134
Da Naboo tink day so smarty.

173
00:15:15,267 --> 00:15:18,182
Day tink day brains so big.

174
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:22,435
Once those droids take control of the
surface, they will take control ofyou.

175
00:15:22,562 --> 00:15:24,849
Mesa no tink so.

176
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,849
Day not know of uss-en.

177
00:15:27,982 --> 00:15:30,897
You and the Naboo form
a symbiont circle.

178
00:15:31,025 --> 00:15:34,392
What happens to one ofyou will affect
the other. You must understand this.

179
00:15:34,526 --> 00:15:39,315
Wesa no carrrre-nn about da Naboo.

180
00:15:39,445 --> 00:15:41,981
Then speed us on our way.

181
00:15:42,113 --> 00:15:44,602
Wesa ganna speed yous away.

182
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:47,525
We could use a transport.

183
00:15:47,658 --> 00:15:50,491
Wesa give yousa una bongo.

184
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:53,699
Da speediest way tooda Naboo...

185
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:58,533
'tis goen through the planet core.

186
00:15:58,663 --> 00:16:00,535
Now...

187
00:16:00,664 --> 00:16:02,454
go.

188
00:16:02,581 --> 00:16:04,821
Thankyou foryour help.
We leave in peace.

189
00:16:04,957 --> 00:16:06,995
Master, what's a bongo?

190
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,081
A transport, I hope.

191
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:11,283
Deysa setten yousa up.

192
00:16:11,419 --> 00:16:15,035
Goen through da planet core?
Bad bombin'.

193
00:16:16,546 --> 00:16:19,331
Any help here would be hot.

194
00:16:20,673 --> 00:16:22,545
Master, we're short on time.

195
00:16:23,675 --> 00:16:26,294
We'll need a navigator to get us
through the planet's core.

196
00:16:26,426 --> 00:16:28,382
This Gungan may be of help.

197
00:16:30,511 --> 00:16:33,545
What is to become
ofJarJar Binks here?

198
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:38,587
Hisen to be pune-ished.

199
00:16:39,515 --> 00:16:40,889
I saved his life.

200
00:16:41,016 --> 00:16:43,505
He owes me
what you call a "Iife-debt."

201
00:16:43,642 --> 00:16:47,471
Your gods demand
that his life belongs to me now.

202
00:16:47,603 --> 00:16:49,927
Binks...

203
00:16:50,062 --> 00:16:54,009
yousa havena liveplay
with thisen hisen?

204
00:17:00,775 --> 00:17:02,600
Begone wit him!

205
00:17:05,278 --> 00:17:07,648
Count me outta dis one.

206
00:17:07,779 --> 00:17:10,897
Better dead here
than dead in da core.

207
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,148
Yee gods!
What mesa sayin?

208
00:17:32,374 --> 00:17:35,159
Dis is nutsen.
Oh, gooberfish!

209
00:17:35,292 --> 00:17:38,540
- Why were you banished,JarJar?
- It's a longo tale-o...

210
00:17:38,668 --> 00:17:43,706
buta a small part of it
would be mesa... clumsy.

211
00:17:43,837 --> 00:17:48,626
- You were banished for being clumsy?
- Yousa might'n be sayin dat.

212
00:18:01,554 --> 00:18:05,763
Mesa caused mabee one two-y
lettle bitty axadentes, huh?

213
00:18:05,889 --> 00:18:07,927
Yud-say boom da gasser...

214

00:18:18,103 --> 00:18:20,177
Big gooberfish!
Huge-o teeth!

216
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:35,027
- There's always a bigger fish.
- Mesa tink we goen back now.

217
00:18:46,408 --> 00:18:49,609
The invasion is on schedule,
my lord.

218
00:18:49,743 --> 00:18:52,742
Ihave thesenate
boggeddown inprocedures.

219
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:57,280
They willhave no choice but
to acceptyourcontrolofthesystem.

220
00:18:57,414 --> 00:19:02,120
The queen has great faith
that the senate will side with her.

221
00:19:02,249 --> 00:19:05,201
QueenAmidala isyoungandnaive.

222
00:19:05,334 --> 00:19:08,783
You will findcontrollingher
willnotbe difficult.

223
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:10,791
Yes, my lord.

224
00:19:12,254 --> 00:19:15,123
You didn't tell him
about the missingJedi.

225
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:19,748
No need to report that to him
until we have something to report.

226
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:27,958
- Where wesa goin?
- Don't worry. The Force will guide us.

227
00:19:28,095 --> 00:19:30,880
Oh, maxi big, da Force.

228
00:19:31,805 --> 00:19:33,796
Well, dat smells stinkowiff.

229
00:19:35,181 --> 00:19:37,551
- We're losing power.
- Oh, no!

230
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:45,759
Wesa dyin' here.

231
00:19:45,895 --> 00:19:48,562
-Just relax. We're not in trouble yet.
- What "yet"?

232
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,640
Monsters out dare.
Leak'n in here.

233
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:56,728
All sink'n and no power?
Whena yousa tinkin wesa in trouble?

234
00:19:58,026 --> 00:20:00,313
Power's back.

235
00:20:00,443 --> 00:20:02,517
Monster's back!

236
00:20:10,365 --> 00:20:12,107
Relax.

237
00:20:12,241 --> 00:20:13,698
You overdid it.

238
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,496
Head for that outcropping.

239
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,533
Oh, boy.

240
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,925
Viceroy, we have captured the queen.

241
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,727
Ah, victory.

242
00:21:28,235 --> 00:21:30,392
Dis'n loverly.

243
00:21:36,572 --> 00:21:38,896
How will you explain this invasion
to the senate?

244
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:43,192
The queen and I will sign a treaty that
will legitimize our occupation here.

245
00:21:43,325 --> 00:21:46,490
I have assurances
it will be ratified by the senate.

246
00:21:46,618 --> 00:21:50,067
- I will not cooperate.
- Now, now, Your Highness.

247
00:21:50,203 --> 00:21:54,328
In time, your people's suffering will
persuade you to see our point ofview.

248
00:21:55,664 --> 00:21:57,572
- Commander.
- Yes, sir.

249
00:21:57,707 --> 00:21:59,330
Process them.

250
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:01,248
Captain, take them to Camp 4.

251
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:02,998
Roger, roger.

252
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,065
We should leave the street,
Your Highness.

253
00:23:00,195 --> 00:23:01,818
Get their weapons.

254
00:23:03,655 --> 00:23:05,895
Yousa guys bombad!

255
00:23:07,532 --> 00:23:09,902
We're ambassadors
for the supreme chancellor.

256
00:23:10,033 --> 00:23:11,905
Your negotiations seemed
to have failed, Ambassador.

257
00:23:12,034 --> 00:23:13,859
The negotiations
never took place.

258
00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:16,363
It's urgent that we make contact
with the Republic.

259
00:23:16,494 --> 00:23:18,568
They've knocked out
all our communications.

260
00:23:18,703 --> 00:23:22,034
- Do you have transports?
- In the main hangar. This way.

261
00:23:26,999 --> 00:23:30,081
- There are too many of them.
- That won't be a problem.

262
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:33,741
Your Highness, under the circumstances,
I suggest you come to Coruscant with us.

263
00:23:33,877 --> 00:23:36,911
Thankyou, Ambassador,
but my place is with my people.

264
00:23:37,045 --> 00:23:39,748
- They will kill you ifyou stay.
- They wouldn't dare.

265
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,918
They need her to sign a treaty
to make this invasion legal.

266
00:23:42,048 --> 00:23:43,589
They can't afford to kill her.

267
00:23:43,715 --> 00:23:45,836
There is something else behind all this,
Your Highness.

268
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,922
There's no logic
in the Federation's move here.

269
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:50,007
My feelings tell me
they will destroyyou.

270
00:23:50,135 --> 00:23:52,505
Our only hope is for the senate
to side with us.

271
00:23:52,636 --> 00:23:55,090
Senator Palpatine
will need your help.

272
00:23:55,221 --> 00:23:59,168
Either choice presents great danger...
to us all.

273
00:23:59,306 --> 00:24:01,178
We are brave, Your Highness.

274
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:04,555
Ifyou are to leave,
Your Highness, it must be now.

275
00:24:04,683 --> 00:24:07,137
Then I will plead our case
to the senate.

276
00:24:08,185 --> 00:24:09,975
Be careful, Governor.

277
00:24:18,898 --> 00:24:20,972
We'll need to free those pilots.

278
00:24:22,233 --> 00:24:24,105
I'll deal with that.

279
00:24:27,569 --> 00:24:28,599
Halt.

280
00:24:28,736 --> 00:24:30,395
I'm ambassador
to the supreme chancellor.

281
00:24:30,529 --> 00:24:32,105
I'm taking these people to Coruscant.

282
00:24:32,238 --> 00:24:35,439
- Where are you taking them?
- To Coruscant.

283
00:24:35,573 --> 00:24:38,192
Coruscant?
Uh, that doesn't compute.

284
00:24:38,324 --> 00:24:40,232
Uh, wait.
Uh, you're under arrest.

285
00:24:45,703 --> 00:24:46,900
Come on. Move!

286
00:24:52,289 --> 00:24:53,237
Go!

287
00:25:18,802 --> 00:25:22,085
Now, stay here
and keep out of trouble.

288
00:25:25,888 --> 00:25:28,045
Hello, boyos.

289
00:25:34,392 --> 00:25:36,015
There's the blockade.

290
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,063
The shield generator's been hit!

291
00:25:56,569 --> 00:25:58,145
How wude!

292
00:26:08,158 --> 00:26:09,734
We're losing droids fast.

293
00:26:10,576 --> 00:26:13,195
Ifwe can't get the shield generator
fixed, we'll be sitting ducks.

294
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:16,614
The shields are gone.

295
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,076
The power's back!

296
00:26:28,876 --> 00:26:32,325
That little droid did it.
He bypassed the main power drive.

297
00:26:32,461 --> 00:26:35,033
Deflector shields up at maximum.

298
00:26:44,634 --> 00:26:48,332
There's not enough power to get us
to Coruscant. The hyperdrive is leaking.

299
00:26:48,469 --> 00:26:51,338
We'll have to land somewhere
to refuel and repair the ship.

300
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:53,627
Here, Master.
Tatooine.

301
00:26:53,763 --> 00:26:55,422
It's small, out of the way, poor.

302
00:26:55,556 --> 00:26:57,298
The Trade Federation
have no presence there.

303
00:26:57,431 --> 00:26:59,303
How can you be sure?

304
00:26:59,432 --> 00:27:01,340
It's controlled by the Hutts.

305
00:27:01,475 --> 00:27:04,260
You can't take Her Royal Highness there.
The Hutts are gangsters.

306
00:27:04,393 --> 00:27:06,680
- If they discovered her--
- It'd be no different than landing...

307
00:27:06,811 --> 00:27:08,683
on a system controlled
by the Federation...

308
00:27:08,812 --> 00:27:10,886
except that the Hutts
aren't looking for her...

309
00:27:11,021 --> 00:27:13,095
which gives us the advantage.

310
00:27:17,566 --> 00:27:20,565
AndQueenAmidala,
hasshesignedthe treaty?

311
00:27:20,692 --> 00:27:24,308
She has disappeared, my lord.

312
00:27:24,444 --> 00:27:28,605
One Naboo cruiser
got past the blockade.

313
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,650
I want that treatysigned.

314
00:27:31,781 --> 00:27:33,819
My lord...

315
00:27:33,949 --> 00:27:36,485
it's impossible to locate the ship.

316
00:27:36,617 --> 00:27:38,822
It's out of our range.

317
00:27:38,951 --> 00:27:41,191
Not fora Sith.

318
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:43,658
This is my apprentice...

319
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,695
Darth Maul.

320
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:50,321
He will findyourlostship.

321
00:27:54,667 --> 00:27:56,954
This is getting out of hand.

322
00:27:57,085 --> 00:27:59,123
Now there are two of them.

323
00:27:59,252 --> 00:28:02,251
We should not
have made this bargain.

324
00:28:07,548 --> 00:28:11,080
An extremely well-put-together
little droid, Your Highness.

325
00:28:11,216 --> 00:28:14,085
Without a doubt, it saved the ship,
as well as our lives.

326
00:28:14,218 --> 00:28:17,549
It is to be commended.
What is its number?

327
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,341
R2-D2, Your Highness.

328
00:28:22,472 --> 00:28:23,882
Thankyou, R2-D2.

329
00:28:27,682 --> 00:28:29,092
Padmé.

330
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:32,763
Clean this droid up
as best you can.

331
00:28:32,893 --> 00:28:34,849
It deserves our gratitude.

332
00:28:36,645 --> 00:28:38,186
Continue, Captain.

333
00:28:41,147 --> 00:28:42,972
Your Highness,
with your permission...

334
00:28:43,106 --> 00:28:45,856
we're heading for a remote planet
called Tatooine.

335
00:28:45,983 --> 00:28:49,314
It's in a system far beyond the reach
of the Trade Federation.

336
00:28:49,443 --> 00:28:52,015
I do not agree
with theJedi on this.

337
00:28:52,152 --> 00:28:55,067
You must trust myjudgment,
Your Highness.

338
00:28:58,489 --> 00:29:00,196
Hello.

339
00:29:00,323 --> 00:29:03,275
Sorry. Husa are yousa?

340
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:05,860

You're a Gungan, aren't you?

343
00:29:13,412 --> 00:29:16,992
- How'd you end up here with us?
- My no know.

00:29:37,298 --> 00:29:40,380
- That's it-- Tatooine.
- There's a settlement.

349
00:29:40,508 --> 00:29:44,585
Land near the outskirts.
We don't want to attract attention.

350
00:30:01,852 --> 00:30:04,637
The hyperdrive generator's gone, Master.
We'll need a new one.

351
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:07,224
That'll complicate things.
Be wary.

352
00:30:07,354 --> 00:30:10,472
- I sense a disturbance in the Force.
- I feel it also, Master.

353
00:30:10,606 --> 00:30:12,644
Don't let them send
any transmissions.

354
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:21,141
The sun doen murder to mesa skin.

355
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:22,771
Wait!

356
00:30:23,862 --> 00:30:25,272
Wait.

357
00:30:28,698 --> 00:30:31,567
Her Highness commands you
to take her handmaiden with you.

358
00:30:31,699 --> 00:30:35,445
No more commands
from Her Highness today, Captain.

359
00:30:35,576 --> 00:30:37,650
The spaceport
is not going to be pleasant.

360
00:30:37,785 --> 00:30:39,906
The queen wishes it.

361
00:30:40,036 --> 00:30:41,944
She's curious about the planet.

362
00:30:44,538 --> 00:30:47,572
This is not a good idea.
Stay close to me.

363
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:04,213
Moisture farms,
for the most part.

364
00:31:05,507 --> 00:31:09,205
Some indigenous tribes
and scavengers.

365
00:31:09,342 --> 00:31:11,214
The few spaceports like this one...

366
00:31:11,343 --> 00:31:13,630
are havens for those
that don't wish to be found.

367
00:31:13,761 --> 00:31:15,669
Like us.

368
00:31:17,012 --> 00:31:19,797
Dissen berry, berry bad.

369
00:31:21,181 --> 00:31:22,888
Icky, icky goo!

370
00:31:35,896 --> 00:31:38,302
We'll try one of the smaller dealers.

371
00:31:44,025 --> 00:31:45,897
Good day to you.

372
00:31:47,568 --> 00:31:48,942
What do you want?

373
00:31:49,069 --> 00:31:52,151
I need parts for aJ-type 327 Nubian.

374
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:56,321
Ah, yes! Nubian.
We have lots of that.

375
00:31:57,073 --> 00:31:58,945
Boy, get in here now!

376
00:31:59,074 --> 00:32:00,946
My droid has a readout ofwhat I need.

377
00:32:03,576 --> 00:32:05,235
What tookyou so long?

378
00:32:06,077 --> 00:32:07,451
I was cleaning the fan switches.

379
00:32:07,578 --> 00:32:10,328
Watch the store.
I've got some selling to do.

380
00:32:10,454 --> 00:32:13,702
So, let me take thee out back, huh?

381
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:15,703
We'll find what you need.

382
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:19,915
Don't touch anything.

383
00:32:30,255 --> 00:32:33,124
- Are you an angel?
- What?

384
00:32:33,256 --> 00:32:36,954
An angel. I heard the deep space
pilots talk about them.

385
00:32:37,091 --> 00:32:39,960
They're the most beautiful
creatures in the universe.

386
00:32:40,093 --> 00:32:42,665
They live on the moons of lego,
I think.

387
00:32:43,469 --> 00:32:47,132
You're a funny little boy.
How do you know so much?

388
00:32:47,263 --> 00:32:51,092
I listen to all the traders
and star pilots who come through here.

389
00:32:51,223 --> 00:32:55,514
I'm a pilot, you know, and someday
I'm gonna fly away from this place.

390
00:32:55,642 --> 00:32:59,589
- You're a pilot?
- Mm-hmm. All my life.

391
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:02,014
How long have you been here?

392
00:33:02,145 --> 00:33:06,140
Since I was very little.
Three, I think.

393
00:33:06,272 --> 00:33:08,975
My mom and I were sold
to Gardulla the Hutt...

394
00:33:09,107 --> 00:33:11,810
but she lost us
betting on the Podraces.

395
00:33:11,941 --> 00:33:13,731
You're a slave?

396
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:17,984
- I'm a person, and my name is Anakin.
- I'm sorry.

397
00:33:18,111 --> 00:33:21,857
I don't fully understand.
This is a strange place to me.

398
00:33:34,285 --> 00:33:35,826
- I got ya.
- Hey!

399
00:33:35,953 --> 00:33:37,695
Hit the nose.

400
00:33:42,372 --> 00:33:45,904
A T-1 4 hyperdrive generator.
Thee in luck.

401
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:48,660
I'm the only one hereabouts
who has one.

402
00:33:48,792 --> 00:33:52,289
But thee might as well buy a new ship.
It would be cheaper, I think, huh.

403
00:33:53,961 --> 00:33:55,335
Saying ofwhich...

404
00:33:55,462 --> 00:33:57,832
how's thee gonna pay
for all this, huh?

405
00:33:57,963 --> 00:34:00,001
I have 20,000 Republic dataries.

406
00:34:00,131 --> 00:34:01,956
Republic credits?

407
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:05,005
Republic credits are no good out here.
I need something more real.

408
00:34:05,133 --> 00:34:08,251
I don't have anything else,
but credits will do fine.

409
00:34:08,384 --> 00:34:12,000
- No, they won't.
- Credits will do fine.

410
00:34:12,136 --> 00:34:13,961
No, they won't!

411
00:34:14,096 --> 00:34:18,257
What, you thinkyou're some kind ofJedi,
waving your hand around like that?

412
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:22,633
I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks
don't work on me. Only money.

413
00:34:23,475 --> 00:34:26,842
No money, no parts, no deal.

414
00:34:26,977 --> 00:34:31,517
And no one else has a T-1 4 hyperdrive,
I promise you that.

415
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:42,643
Wouldn't have lasted long anyways
if I wasn't so good at building things.

416
00:34:46,402 --> 00:34:48,274
We're leaving.JarJar.

417
00:34:50,905 --> 00:34:53,441
I'm glad to have met you, Anakin.

418
00:34:53,572 --> 00:34:55,397
I was glad to meet you too.

419
00:35:03,786 --> 00:35:08,326
Outlanders.
They think we know nothing.

420
00:35:08,454 --> 00:35:10,362
They seemed nice to me.

421
00:35:10,497 --> 00:35:12,405
Clean the racks.

422
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,867
Then you can go home.

423
00:35:13,999 --> 00:35:15,789
Yippee!

424
00:35:21,836 --> 00:35:24,206
Andyou'resure there's
nothingleft on board?

425
00:35:24,337 --> 00:35:26,209
A few containers of supplies.

426
00:35:26,338 --> 00:35:29,372
The queen's wardrobe, maybe,
but not enough foryou to barter with...

427
00:35:29,506 --> 00:35:31,830
not in the amount
you're talking about.

428
00:35:31,966 --> 00:35:34,881
All right. I'm sure
another solution will present itself.

429
00:35:35,009 --> 00:35:36,383
I'll check back later.

430
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:38,835
Noah gain. Noah gain.

431
00:35:38,969 --> 00:35:41,802
Da beings hereabouts, cawazy!

432
00:35:41,929 --> 00:35:44,383
Wesa be wobbed un crunched.

433
00:35:44,513 --> 00:35:47,678
Not likely. We have nothing ofvalue.
That's our problem.

434
00:36:02,938 --> 00:36:04,348
Are you going to pay for that?

435
00:36:06,357 --> 00:36:08,229
It costs seven wupiupi.

436
00:36:13,527 --> 00:36:14,854
Oops.

437
00:36:19,363 --> 00:36:21,235
Is this yours?

438
00:36:21,364 --> 00:36:23,106
Who, mesa--

439
00:36:27,283 --> 00:36:29,404
Careful, Sebulba.

440
00:36:29,534 --> 00:36:31,525
He's a big-time outlander.

441
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:35,192
I'd hate to see you diced
before we race again.

442
00:36:35,329 --> 00:36:39,194
Next time we race, boy,
it will be the end ofyou.

443
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:42,365
Ifyou weren't a slave,
I'd squash you now.

444
00:36:43,082 --> 00:36:45,915
Yeah, it'd be a pity
ifyou had to pay for me.

445
00:36:47,043 --> 00:36:50,161
- Hi.
- Hi there.

446
00:36:50,294 --> 00:36:52,084
Your buddy here was
about to be turned into orange goo.

447
00:36:52,212 --> 00:36:54,084
He picked a fight with a Dug...

448
00:36:54,213 --> 00:36:56,702
an especially dangerous Dug
called Sebulba.

449
00:36:56,839 --> 00:37:00,419
Mesa haten crunchen.
Das da las ting mesa want.

450
00:37:00,549 --> 00:37:04,544
Nevertheless, the boy is right.
You were heading into trouble.

451
00:37:05,093 --> 00:37:06,550
Thanks, myyoung friend.

452
00:37:08,845 --> 00:37:10,717
But mesa doen nutten!

453
00:37:19,224 --> 00:37:21,796
This storm will slow them down.

454
00:37:21,934 --> 00:37:23,427
Looks pretty bad.

455
00:37:24,769 --> 00:37:27,258
- Panaka.
- Receivinga message from home.

456
00:37:27,395 --> 00:37:29,185
We'll be right there.

457
00:37:35,607 --> 00:37:37,764
Here, you'll like these pallies.

458
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,472
- Here.
- Thankyou.

459
00:37:41,652 --> 00:37:43,939
My bones are aching.

460
00:37:44,069 --> 00:37:48,609
Storm's coming up, Ani.
You better get home quick.

461
00:37:48,738 --> 00:37:51,571
- Do you have shelter?
- We'll head back to our ship.

462
00:37:51,698 --> 00:37:54,270
- Is it far?
- It's on the outskirts.

463
00:37:54,408 --> 00:37:56,778
You'll never reach
the outskirts in time.

464
00:37:56,909 --> 00:38:00,774
Sandstorms are very, very dangerous.

465
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:03,365
Come on.
I'll take you to my place.

466
00:38:18,085 --> 00:38:19,282
Mom!

467
00:38:19,419 --> 00:38:23,117
- Mom, I'm home!
- Ah, dissen cosy.

468
00:38:23,255 --> 00:38:25,625
- These are my friends, Mom.
- Hello.

469
00:38:25,756 --> 00:38:29,288
- I'm Qui-GonJinn.
- I'm building a droid. You wanna see?

470
00:38:29,424 --> 00:38:31,794
Your son was kind enough
to offer us shelter.

471
00:38:31,925 --> 00:38:33,881
Come on. I'll showyou 3PO.

472
00:38:43,681 --> 00:38:46,929
Isn't he great?
He's not finished yet.

473
00:38:47,057 --> 00:38:48,336
He's wonderful.

474
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,307
You really like him?

475
00:38:51,434 --> 00:38:54,349
He's a protocol droid
to help Mom. Watch.

476
00:38:58,771 --> 00:39:00,050
Where is everybody?

477
00:39:00,189 --> 00:39:01,351
Whoops.

478
00:39:04,566 --> 00:39:05,728
Oh, hello.

479
00:39:05,858 --> 00:39:09,141
I am C-3PO,
human cyborg relations.

480
00:39:09,276 --> 00:39:11,148
How might I serve you?

481
00:39:11,277 --> 00:39:14,062
- He's perfect.
- Oh. Perfect.

482
00:39:14,195 --> 00:39:17,727
When the storm is over, I'll showyou
my racer. I'm building a Podracer.

483
00:39:19,114 --> 00:39:21,650
I'm not sure this floor
is entirely stable.

484
00:39:21,782 --> 00:39:24,983
Hello. I don't believe
we have been introduced.

485
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:29,150
R2-D2.
A pleasure to meet you.

486
00:39:29,286 --> 00:39:32,320
I am C-3PO,
human cyborg relations.

487
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:38,156
I beg your pardon,
but what do you mean, "naked"?

488
00:39:39,832 --> 00:39:43,080
My parts are showing?
My goodness!

489
00:39:47,711 --> 00:39:50,165
The death toll is catastrophic.

490
00:39:50,296 --> 00:39:52,666
We mustbow to their wishes.

491
00:39:52,797 --> 00:39:54,835
You must contactme.

492
00:39:54,964 --> 00:39:57,631
It's a trick.
Send no reply.

493
00:39:57,757 --> 00:39:59,748
Send no transmissions of any kind.

494
00:40:02,051 --> 00:40:04,920
It sounds like bait
to establish a connection trace.

495
00:40:05,053 --> 00:40:09,000
What if it is true,
and the people are dying?

496
00:40:09,138 --> 00:40:11,592
Either way,
we're running out of time.

497
00:40:25,229 --> 00:40:27,350
Tatooine is sparsely populated.

498
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,265
If the trace was correct,
I will find them quickly, Master.

499
00:40:30,398 --> 00:40:32,270
Move against theJedi first.

500
00:40:32,399 --> 00:40:35,102
You will then have no difficulty
in taking the queen to Naboo...

501
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:37,105
to sign the treaty.

502
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:39,391
At last we will reveal ourselves
to theJedi.

503
00:40:39,527 --> 00:40:41,933
At last we will have revenge.

504
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:44,939
You have been well-trained,
myyoung apprentice.

505
00:40:45,071 --> 00:40:47,441
They will be no match foryou.

506
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:56,320
All slaves have a transmitter
placed inside their bodies somewhere.

507
00:40:57,411 --> 00:41:00,410
I've been working on a scanner
to try and locate mine.

508
00:41:00,537 --> 00:41:04,034
- Any attempt to escape--
- And they blowyou up!

509
00:41:04,956 --> 00:41:06,532
How wude!

510
00:41:06,665 --> 00:41:09,071
I can't believe
there's still slavery in the galaxy.

511
00:41:09,208 --> 00:41:11,080
The Republic's antislavery laws--

512
00:41:11,209 --> 00:41:13,533
The Republic doesn't exist out here.

513
00:41:13,668 --> 00:41:15,825
We must survive on our own.

514
00:41:16,836 --> 00:41:18,329
Xcuse me.

515
00:41:20,421 --> 00:41:22,957
Has anybody ever seen a Podrace?

516
00:41:23,089 --> 00:41:24,879
They have Podracing
on Malastare.

517
00:41:25,007 --> 00:41:27,710
Very fast, very dangerous.

518
00:41:28,508 --> 00:41:30,380
I'm the only human who can do it.

519
00:41:30,509 --> 00:41:33,508
You must haveJedi reflexes
ifyou race pods.

520
00:41:34,636 --> 00:41:36,010
Don't do that again.

521
00:41:41,473 --> 00:41:44,045
You're aJedi knight, aren't you?

522
00:41:47,017 --> 00:41:49,886
- What makes you think that?
- I sawyour laser sword.

523
00:41:50,019 --> 00:41:52,888
OnlyJedis carry
that kind ofweapon.

524
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:56,138
Perhaps I killed aJedi
and took it from him.

525
00:41:56,272 --> 00:41:57,895
I don't think so.

526
00:41:58,022 --> 00:42:00,179
No one can kill aJedi.

527
00:42:01,024 --> 00:42:03,062
I wish that were so.

528
00:42:03,191 --> 00:42:05,229
I had a dream I was aJedi.

529
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:08,524
I came back here
and freed all the slaves.

530
00:42:08,652 --> 00:42:11,983
- Have you come to free us?
- No, I'm afraid not.

531
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:16,439
I thinkyou have.
Why else would you be here?

532
00:42:21,325 --> 00:42:24,075
I can see there's
no fooling you, Anakin.

533
00:42:24,201 --> 00:42:27,200
We're on our way to Coruscant,
the central system in the Republic...

534
00:42:27,328 --> 00:42:29,319
on a very important mission.

535
00:42:29,454 --> 00:42:32,488
How did you end up out here
in the outer rim?

536
00:42:32,622 --> 00:42:36,238
Our ship was damaged, and we're
stranded here until we can repair it.

537
00:42:37,499 --> 00:42:40,700
I can help.
I can fix anything.

538
00:42:40,834 --> 00:42:42,327
I believe you can.

539
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:45,245
But first we must acquire
the parts we need.

540
00:42:45,378 --> 00:42:48,081
Wit no-nutten mula to trade.

541
00:42:48,213 --> 00:42:51,745
Thesejunk dealers
must have a weakness of some kind.

542
00:42:51,881 --> 00:42:56,172
Gambling. Everything here revolves
around betting on those awful races.

543
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,544
Podracing.

544
00:42:57,675 --> 00:43:00,590
Greed can be a powerful ally.

545
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:03,588
I built a racer.
It's the fastest ever.

546
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,007
There's a big race tomorrow
on Boonta Eve.

547
00:43:06,138 --> 00:43:08,094
You could enter my pod.

548
00:43:09,056 --> 00:43:12,090
- Anakin, Watto won't let you.
- Watto doesn't know I've built it.

549
00:43:12,224 --> 00:43:14,096
You could make him think
it was yours...

550
00:43:14,225 --> 00:43:16,430
and get him
to let me pilot it foryou.

551
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:18,135
I don't want you to race.
It's awful.

552
00:43:18,269 --> 00:43:20,758
I die every time
Watto makes you do it.

553
00:43:20,895 --> 00:43:23,016
But, Mom, I love it.

554
00:43:23,146 --> 00:43:26,678
The prize money would more than pay
for the parts they need.

555
00:43:26,814 --> 00:43:29,101
Anakin.

556
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:31,982
Your mother's right.

557
00:43:32,108 --> 00:43:35,190
Is there anyone friendly to the Republic
who can help us?

558
00:43:36,694 --> 00:43:38,353
No.

559
00:43:43,447 --> 00:43:48,071
Mom, you say the biggest problem in this
universe is nobody helps each other.

560
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:55,779
I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want
to put your son in danger.

561
00:43:55,911 --> 00:43:57,819
We'll find some other way.

562
00:44:00,288 --> 00:44:02,742
There is no other way.

563
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:07,200
I may not like it,
but he can help you.

564
00:44:08,084 --> 00:44:09,956
He was meant to help you.

565
00:44:23,508 --> 00:44:25,380
Are you sure about this?

566
00:44:25,509 --> 00:44:28,128
Trusting our fate
to a boy we hardly know?

567
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,298
The queen will not approve.

568
00:44:30,428 --> 00:44:32,300
The queen doesn't need to know.

569
00:44:33,429 --> 00:44:35,052
Well, I don't approve.

570
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:38,799
The boy tells me you want
to sponsor him in the race.

571
00:44:38,932 --> 00:44:40,555
How can you do this?

572
00:44:40,682 --> 00:44:43,965
Not on the Republic credits,
I think.

573
00:44:44,101 --> 00:44:46,258
My ship will be the entry fee.

574
00:44:46,769 --> 00:44:48,476
Not bad!

575
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:51,555
Not bad, huh?
Nubian, huh?

576
00:44:51,688 --> 00:44:54,971
It's in good order,
except for the parts I need.

577
00:44:55,106 --> 00:44:57,595
What would the boy ride?

578
00:44:57,732 --> 00:45:01,264
He smashed up my pod in the last race.
It would take some long time to fix it.

579
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,724
It wasn't my fault.
Really.

580
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:05,483
Sebulba flashed me with his vents.

581
00:45:05,611 --> 00:45:08,978
I actually saved the pod, mostly.

582
00:45:10,113 --> 00:45:12,567
That you did.

583
00:45:12,697 --> 00:45:15,482
The boy's good.
No doubts there, huh?

584
00:45:15,615 --> 00:45:18,104
I have acquired a pod
in a game of chance.

585
00:45:18,242 --> 00:45:19,901
The fastest ever built.

586
00:45:20,034 --> 00:45:25,156
I hope you didn't kill
anyone I know for it, huh?

587
00:45:27,121 --> 00:45:30,653
So, you supply the pod
and the entry fee...

588
00:45:30,789 --> 00:45:32,163
and I supply the boy.

589
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:36,155
We split the winnings 50-50,
I think, huh?

590
00:45:36,292 --> 00:45:38,164
If it's going to be 50-50...

591
00:45:38,293 --> 00:45:40,912
I suggest you front the cash
for the entry.

592
00:45:41,044 --> 00:45:43,082
Ifwe win...

593
00:45:43,212 --> 00:45:46,993
you keep all the winnings,
minus the cost of the parts I need.

594
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:50,331
And ifwe lose,
you keep my ship.

595
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,210
Either way, you win.

596
00:46:00,011 --> 00:46:01,338
Deal!

597
00:46:06,556 --> 00:46:10,800
Your friend
is a foolish one, methinks.

598
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:21,685
What if this plan fails, Master?

599
00:46:21,813 --> 00:46:24,516
We could be stuck here
a very long time.

600
00:46:24,648 --> 00:46:27,184
Well, it's too dangerous
to call forhelp...

601
00:46:27,316 --> 00:46:30,683
and a ship without a power supply
isn't going to get us anywhere.

602
00:46:30,818 --> 00:46:32,774
And...

603
00:46:32,902 --> 00:46:34,774
there's something about this boy.

604
00:46:41,614 --> 00:46:43,938
You should be very proud ofyour son.

605
00:46:44,699 --> 00:46:47,023
He gives without any thought
of reward.

606
00:46:47,159 --> 00:46:50,028
He knows nothing of greed.

607
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,238
He has--

608
00:46:52,244 --> 00:46:54,116
He has special powers.

609
00:46:55,913 --> 00:46:57,110
Yes.

610
00:46:57,247 --> 00:46:59,866
He can see things
before they happen.

611
00:46:59,998 --> 00:47:02,783
That's why he appears
to have such quick reflexes.

612
00:47:02,916 --> 00:47:04,788
It's aJedi trait.

613
00:47:04,917 --> 00:47:07,702
He deserves better
than a slave's life.

614
00:47:07,835 --> 00:47:11,202
Had he been born in the Republic,
we would have identified him early.

615
00:47:13,629 --> 00:47:17,375
The Force is unusually strong with him.
That much is clear.

616
00:47:17,506 --> 00:47:19,248
Who was his father?

617
00:47:21,967 --> 00:47:23,875
There was no father.

618
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:28,674
I carried him,
I gave birth, I raised him.

619
00:47:29,554 --> 00:47:32,043
I can't explain what happened.

620
00:47:33,722 --> 00:47:35,512
Can you help him?

621
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:37,512
I don't know.

622
00:47:40,017 --> 00:47:43,633
I didn't actually come here
to free slaves.

623
00:47:56,775 --> 00:47:58,647
Wow, a real astro droid!

624
00:48:00,568 --> 00:48:04,314
- How do you get so lucky?
- That isn't the half of it.

625
00:48:04,445 --> 00:48:07,397
- I'm in the Boonta race tomorrow.
- What?

626
00:48:07,530 --> 00:48:09,237
With this?

627
00:48:09,364 --> 00:48:12,114
You're such a joker, Ani.

628
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,441
- You've been working on that foryears.
- It's never gonna run.

629
00:48:15,575 --> 00:48:17,732
Come on.
Let's go and play ball.

630
00:48:17,868 --> 00:48:21,151
Keep racing, Ani.
You're gonna be bug squash.

631
00:48:29,707 --> 00:48:32,077
Keep away from
those energy binders.

632
00:48:32,208 --> 00:48:35,657
Ifyour hand gets caught in the beam,
it's gonna go numb for hours.

633
00:48:35,793 --> 00:48:37,167
Okay.

634
00:48:40,879 --> 00:48:43,415
My tongue is fat.

635
00:48:43,547 --> 00:48:46,629
My tongue-- Wrench.

636
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:49,424
Where is de wrench?
Oh, dare it is.

637
00:48:53,885 --> 00:48:55,426
I'm stuck.

638
00:48:55,552 --> 00:48:59,547
You know, I find thatJarJar creature
to be a little odd.

639
00:49:01,389 --> 00:49:04,222
You don't even know
if this thing's gonna run.

640
00:49:04,348 --> 00:49:06,422
- It will.
- I think it's time we found out.

641
00:49:06,558 --> 00:49:08,763
- Here, use this power charge.
- Yes, sir!

642
00:49:08,892 --> 00:49:10,930
Come on, Kitster.
Let's move away.

643
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:13,265
My mouth.

644
00:49:13,394 --> 00:49:14,721
Ani, I'm stuck.

645
00:49:19,939 --> 00:49:22,096
My tongue is fat.

646
00:49:22,232 --> 00:49:25,184
You're quite right.
He's very odd indeed.

647
00:49:27,401 --> 00:49:29,439
Thankyou.

648
00:49:29,568 --> 00:49:30,978
Go.

649
00:49:45,493 --> 00:49:49,109
It's working!
It's working!

650
00:49:59,749 --> 00:50:02,238
Stay still, Ani.
Let me clean this cut.

651
00:50:02,376 --> 00:50:06,288
There's so many.
Do they all have a system of planets?

652
00:50:06,419 --> 00:50:08,291
Most of them.

653
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:10,376
Has anyone been to 'em all?

654
00:50:12,088 --> 00:50:13,285
Not likely.

655
00:50:14,423 --> 00:50:16,628
I wanna be the first one
to see 'em all.

656
00:50:17,841 --> 00:50:20,211
Ani, bedtime!

657
00:50:20,342 --> 00:50:23,092
There we are.
Good as new.

658
00:50:23,219 --> 00:50:26,088
Ani, I'm not gonna tell you again.

659
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:29,634
- What are you doing?
- Checking your blood for infections.

660
00:50:29,763 --> 00:50:31,304
Go on.

661
00:50:31,431 --> 00:50:33,387
You have a big day tomorrow.

662
00:50:33,515 --> 00:50:35,387
Sleep well, Ani.

663
00:50:38,142 --> 00:50:40,133
- Obi-Wan?
- Yes, Master?

664
00:50:40,268 --> 00:50:42,971
I need an analysis
of this blood sample I'm sending you.

665
00:50:43,103 --> 00:50:44,810
Wait a minute.

666
00:50:46,521 --> 00:50:48,477
I need a midi-chlorian count.

667
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,059
The reading is off the chart.

668
00:50:54,192 --> 00:50:56,064
Over 20,000.

669
00:50:56,193 --> 00:50:59,809
Even Master Yoda doesn'thave
a midi-chlorian count thathigh.

670
00:50:59,944 --> 00:51:01,734
NoJedi has.

671
00:51:01,862 --> 00:51:03,900
What does that mean?

672
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:06,403
I'm not sure.

673
00:52:16,314 --> 00:52:19,183
I wanna see your spaceship
the moment the race is over.

674
00:52:19,315 --> 00:52:21,057
Patience, my blue friend.

675
00:52:21,191 --> 00:52:23,431
You'll have your winnings
before the suns set.

676
00:52:23,567 --> 00:52:25,357
And we'll be far away from here.

677
00:52:25,485 --> 00:52:29,527
Not ifyour ship belongs to me,
I think, huh?

678
00:52:29,653 --> 00:52:33,020
I warn you, no funny business.

679
00:52:33,155 --> 00:52:36,273
- You don't think Anakin can win?
- Don't get me wrongo.

680
00:52:36,406 --> 00:52:38,860
I have great faith in the boy.

681
00:52:38,991 --> 00:52:41,112
He's a credit to your race...

682
00:52:41,242 --> 00:52:44,443
but Sebulba there
is going to win, I think.

683
00:52:46,578 --> 00:52:48,320
Oh, no!

684
00:52:52,497 --> 00:52:54,322
Why do you think that?

685
00:52:54,457 --> 00:52:56,329
He always wins!

686
00:52:58,333 --> 00:53:00,787
I am betting heavily on Sebulba.

687
00:53:02,627 --> 00:53:05,330
- I'll take that bet.
- What?

688
00:53:06,087 --> 00:53:09,418
I'll wager my new racing pod
against, say...

689
00:53:09,547 --> 00:53:11,419
the boy and his mother.

690
00:53:11,548 --> 00:53:15,246
No pod is worth two slaves,
not by a long shot.

691
00:53:16,175 --> 00:53:17,917
The boy, then.

692
00:53:24,137 --> 00:53:26,626
We'll let fate decide, huh?

693
00:53:26,764 --> 00:53:30,178
I just happen to have
a chance cube here.

694
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:33,341
Blue, it's the boy.

695
00:53:33,475 --> 00:53:34,589
Red...

696
00:53:36,018 --> 00:53:37,641
his mother.

697
00:53:47,357 --> 00:53:49,763
You won this small toss,
outlander...

698
00:53:49,899 --> 00:53:52,020
but you won't win the race!

699
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:54,224
So it makes little difference!

700
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:08,939
Better stop your friend's betting
or I'll end up owning him too.

701
00:54:12,702 --> 00:54:15,191
- What'd he mean by that?
- I'll tell you later.

702
00:54:15,328 --> 00:54:16,702
Good morning.

703
00:54:18,830 --> 00:54:21,580
Oh, my.
Space travel sounds rather perilous.

704
00:54:23,665 --> 00:54:27,660
I can assure you, they will never get me
onto one of those dreadful starships.

705
00:54:27,792 --> 00:54:31,159
This is so wizard, Ani.
I'm sure you'll do it this time.

706
00:54:31,294 --> 00:54:32,372
Do what?

707
00:54:32,503 --> 00:54:35,537
Finish the race, of course.

708
00:54:35,671 --> 00:54:37,413
You've never won a race?

709
00:54:37,547 --> 00:54:40,250
Well, not exactly.

710
00:54:40,382 --> 00:54:42,373
Not even finished?

711
00:54:42,508 --> 00:54:44,962
Kitster's right.
I will this time.

712
00:54:45,092 --> 00:54:47,130
Of course you will.

713
00:55:16,774 --> 00:55:18,599
That's absolutely right.

714
00:55:18,733 --> 00:55:23,771
And a big turnout here from all corners
of the outer rim territories.

715
00:55:23,902 --> 00:55:27,518
I see the contestants are making
their way out onto the starting grid.

716
00:55:29,613 --> 00:55:32,446
Isee Ben Quadinaros
from the TundSystem.

717
00:55:38,117 --> 00:55:40,571
Two-time winnerBoles Roor.

718
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:44,909
Sebulba.!

719
00:55:55,334 --> 00:55:58,416
And in the front row,
nearside pole position...

720
00:55:58,543 --> 00:56:00,534
Mawhonic.!

721
00:56:01,753 --> 00:56:03,791
A heartyhello...

722
00:56:03,921 --> 00:56:07,619
to Clegg Holdfast
andhis Voltec KT9 Wasp.!

723
00:56:10,632 --> 00:56:13,631
Andbackagain,
it's the mightyDudBolt...

724
00:56:13,759 --> 00:56:18,335
with thatincredible racingmachine,
the Vulptereen 327.

725
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:23,966
Andhoping fora big win today...

726
00:56:24,097 --> 00:56:28,507
Ody Mandrell,
with his record-settingpit droidteam.

727
00:56:33,393 --> 00:56:36,641
Anda late entry,
youngAnakin Skywalker...

728
00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:38,049
a localboy.

729
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:43,012
I see the flags are moving
out onto the track.

730
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:04,781
Be safe.

731
00:57:04,908 --> 00:57:07,232
I will, Mom. I promise.

732
00:57:23,417 --> 00:57:26,084
You won't walk away from this one...

733
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:28,450
you slave scum.

734
00:57:28,586 --> 00:57:31,834
Don't count on it, slime ball.

735
00:57:31,962 --> 00:57:34,332
You're bantha fodder!

736
00:57:38,924 --> 00:57:41,129
- You all set, Ani?
- Yep.

737
00:57:41,258 --> 00:57:42,881
Right.

738
00:57:47,011 --> 00:57:49,630
Remember, concentrate
on the moment.

739
00:57:49,762 --> 00:57:53,508
Feel, don't think.
Use your instincts.

740
00:57:53,639 --> 00:57:55,262
I will.

741
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:57,595
May the Force be with you.

742
00:58:06,562 --> 00:58:08,553
Jabba the Hutt.

743
00:58:18,776 --> 00:58:23,186
Welcome.

744
00:58:24,154 --> 00:58:27,402
Begin the race!

745
00:58:37,952 --> 00:58:41,117
Hey, looks like
they're clearing thegrid.

746
00:58:42,329 --> 00:58:44,201
- Is he nervous?
- He's fine.

747
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:48,699
YouJedi are far too reckless.
The queen is not--

748
00:58:48,832 --> 00:58:51,701
The queen trusts myjudgment,
young handmaiden.

749
00:58:51,833 --> 00:58:54,038
You should too.

750
00:58:54,168 --> 00:58:56,242
You assume too much.

751
00:58:57,002 --> 00:58:59,408
Startyourengines.

752
00:59:38,689 --> 00:59:42,020
Oh, dissen gonna be messy.
Me no watch'n!

753
01:00:02,033 --> 01:00:03,312
Oh, no!

754
01:00:08,953 --> 01:00:12,236
Wait.
Little Skywalker has stalled.

755
01:00:22,709 --> 01:00:26,918
Itlooks like Quadinaros
ishaving engine trouble also.

756
01:00:28,504 --> 01:00:29,783
Come on, Ani!

757
01:00:36,216 --> 01:00:37,792
Andtheregoes Skywalker.!

758
01:00:37,925 --> 01:00:39,382
Go, Ani, go!

759
01:00:39,509 --> 01:00:41,630
He willbe hard-pressed
to catch up with the leaders.

760
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:58,627
Looks like a few Tusken Raiders
are campedout...

761
01:01:58,755 --> 01:02:01,042
on the canyon dune turn.

762
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:15,959
There goes Quadinaros'
power coupling.

763
01:02:43,693 --> 01:02:45,898
Oh, no!

764
01:02:50,696 --> 01:02:52,568
Where is Master Anakin?

765
01:02:55,823 --> 01:02:58,028
Look. Here he comes.

766
01:03:00,909 --> 01:03:03,233
Itlooks like Skywalker
ismoving up in the field.

767
01:03:04,119 --> 01:03:05,529
Yay! Yippee!

768
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:16,620
He has to complete
two more circuits? Oh, dear.

769
01:04:24,198 --> 01:04:26,070
Skywalker's
spinning out of control!

770
01:05:23,976 --> 01:05:27,923
I don't care what universe you're from.
That's gotta hurt!

771
01:05:34,982 --> 01:05:36,689
Here he comes!

772
01:05:36,816 --> 01:05:39,934
At thestart ofthe thirdandfinallap,
Sebulba's in the lead...

773
01:05:40,067 --> 01:05:42,556
followedclosely by Skywalker.!

774
01:05:42,694 --> 01:05:43,558
Go, Ani!

775
01:06:10,582 --> 01:06:12,906
Skywalker's been forced
onto the service ramp!

776
01:06:34,593 --> 01:06:35,967
It's Skywalker!

777
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:38,254
Sebulba!

778
01:06:38,386 --> 01:06:42,630
Amazing! A quick control thrust,
and he's back on course!

779
01:06:42,764 --> 01:07:16,447
Did he crash-ed?

780
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,185
Skywalker's in trouble!
Sebulba takes the lead!

781
01:08:21,923 --> 01:08:23,574
He's catching Sebulba!

782
01:08:24,702 --> 01:08:27,179
Careful, Ani. Careful, Ani!

783
01:08:57,392 --> 01:08:59,751
That little human being
is out of his mind!

784
01:09:00,877 --> 01:09:02,034
They're side byside.!

785
01:09:30,539 --> 01:09:32,402
- Yippee!
- Yay!

786
01:09:36,596 --> 01:09:38,294
I can't believe it.

787
01:09:38,421 --> 01:09:40,319
The crowds are going nuts!

788
01:09:49,208 --> 01:09:51,236
Yay, Ani!

789
01:09:52,568 --> 01:09:55,588
Mom, I did it! Yay!

790
01:10:06,052 --> 01:10:07,915
Good going, Ani!

791
01:10:12,274 --> 01:10:14,220
We owe you everything, Ani.

792
01:10:16,837 --> 01:10:18,948
It's so wonderful, Ani.

793
01:10:19,077 --> 01:10:21,768
You have brought hope
to those who have none.

794
01:10:21,899 --> 01:10:24,093
I'm so very proud ofyou.

795
01:10:34,510 --> 01:10:36,373
You!

796
01:10:36,502 --> 01:10:38,778
You swindled me.

797
01:10:38,908 --> 01:10:42,672
You knew the boy was going to win.
Somehowyou knew it.

798
01:10:42,808 --> 01:10:44,671
I lost everything.

799
01:10:44,799 --> 01:10:48,314
Wheneveryou gamble, my friend,
eventuallyyou lose.

800
01:10:48,450 --> 01:10:50,892
Bring the parts
to the main hangar.

801
01:10:51,022 --> 01:10:54,089
I'll come byyour shop later on
so you can release the boy.

802
01:10:54,216 --> 01:10:57,483
You can't have him.
It wasn't a fair bet.

803
01:11:00,231 --> 01:11:03,664
Would you like to discuss it
with the Hutts?

804
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:06,277
I'm sure they can settle this.

805
01:11:07,782 --> 01:11:09,645
Take him.

806
01:11:16,577 --> 01:11:17,602
Hidoe!

807
01:11:19,232 --> 01:11:21,296
Well, we have all
the essential parts we need.

808
01:11:21,430 --> 01:11:22,456
I'm going back.

809
01:11:22,593 --> 01:11:24,657
Some unfinished business.
I won't be long.

810
01:11:24,792 --> 01:11:28,224
Why do I sense we've picked up
another pathetic life-form?

811
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:32,125
It's the boy who's responsible
for getting us these parts.

812
01:11:32,259 --> 01:11:34,122
Get this hyperdrive
generator installed.

813
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:36,774
Yes, Master.
That shouldn't take long.

814
01:11:36,905 --> 01:11:39,051
Come on. Hup!

815
01:11:43,668 --> 01:11:45,531
Hey. These are yours.

816
01:11:47,526 --> 01:11:48,764
Yes!

817
01:11:50,441 --> 01:11:53,177
Mom, we sold the pod!
Look at all the money we have!

818
01:11:53,303 --> 01:11:55,662
My goodness!
But that's so wonderful, Ani.

819
01:11:55,792 --> 01:11:58,730
- And he has been freed.
- What?

820
01:11:58,862 --> 01:12:00,643
You're no longer a slave.

821
01:12:02,555 --> 01:12:04,453
Did you hear that?

822
01:12:05,252 --> 01:12:07,694
Nowyou can make
your dreams come true, Ani.

823
01:12:08,570 --> 01:12:10,468
You are free.

824
01:12:14,046 --> 01:12:15,496
Will you take him with you?

825
01:12:15,622 --> 01:12:17,237
Is he to become aJedi?

826
01:12:17,365 --> 01:12:19,889
Yes. Our meeting
was not a coincidence.

827
01:12:20,725 --> 01:12:22,377
Nothing happens by accident.

828
01:12:22,510 --> 01:12:26,025
You mean I get to come with you
in your starship?

829
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:27,563
Anakin...

830
01:12:29,479 --> 01:12:32,746
training to become aJedi
is not an easy challenge...

831
01:12:32,881 --> 01:12:35,736
and even ifyou succeed,
it's a hard life.

832
01:12:35,867 --> 01:12:39,016
But I wanna go. It's what
I've always dreamed of doing.

833
01:12:39,850 --> 01:12:41,962
Can I go, Mom?

834
01:12:42,921 --> 01:12:44,572
Anakin...

835
01:12:44,704 --> 01:12:47,605
this path has been placed
before you.

836
01:12:47,733 --> 01:12:50,175
The choice is yours alone.

837
01:12:53,831 --> 01:12:55,694
I wanna do it.

838
01:12:58,270 --> 01:13:00,464
Then packyour things.
We haven't much time.

839
01:13:07,065 --> 01:13:08,634
What about Mom?

840
01:13:11,753 --> 01:13:13,616
Is she free too?

841
01:13:13,744 --> 01:13:17,224
I tried to free your mother, Ani,
but Watto wouldn't have it.

842
01:13:18,266 --> 01:13:20,212
You're coming with us,
aren't you, Mom?

843
01:13:28,181 --> 01:13:31,496
Son, my place is here.
My future is here.

844
01:13:31,625 --> 01:13:33,984
It is time foryou to let go.

845
01:13:35,109 --> 01:13:37,220
I don't want things to change.

846
01:13:37,349 --> 01:13:39,708
But you can't stop the change...

847
01:13:39,838 --> 01:13:42,906
any more than you can
stop the suns from setting.

848
01:13:43,988 --> 01:13:45,886
I love you.

849
01:13:51,538 --> 01:13:53,401
Now hurry.

850
01:13:58,922 --> 01:14:00,289
Thankyou.

851
01:14:00,415 --> 01:14:03,317
I'll watch after him.
You have my word.

852
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:07,046
Will you be all right?

853
01:14:08,506 --> 01:14:09,956
Yeah.

854
01:14:14,977 --> 01:14:16,546
Hello, Master Anakin.

855
01:14:16,678 --> 01:14:18,742
Well, 3PO, I've been freed...

856
01:14:18,876 --> 01:14:21,235
and I'm going away in a starship.

857
01:14:21,365 --> 01:14:24,267
Master Anakin, you are my maker
and I wish you well.

858
01:14:24,395 --> 01:14:28,583
However, I should prefer it
if I were a little more completed.

859
01:14:28,709 --> 01:14:31,811
I'm sorry I wasn't able
to finish you, 3PO...

860
01:14:31,945 --> 01:14:33,973
give you coverings and all.

861
01:14:34,102 --> 01:14:35,717
I'm gonna miss working on you.

862
01:14:35,844 --> 01:14:38,286
You've been a great pal.

863
01:14:38,416 --> 01:14:41,023
I'll make sure Mom
doesn't sell you or anything.

864
01:14:41,818 --> 01:14:42,844
Sell me?

865
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:44,595
Bye.

866
01:14:44,723 --> 01:14:46,090
Oh, my.

867
01:15:10,610 --> 01:15:12,804
I can't do it, Mom.
I just can't do it.

868
01:15:17,081 --> 01:15:19,062
Will I ever see you again?

869
01:15:20,524 --> 01:15:23,380
What does your heart tell you?

870
01:15:24,715 --> 01:15:26,613
I hope so.

871
01:15:27,370 --> 01:15:29,233
Yes.

872
01:15:29,361 --> 01:15:30,930
I guess.

873
01:15:31,975 --> 01:15:34,534
Then we will
see each other again.

874
01:15:37,243 --> 01:15:40,015
I will come back
and free you, Mom.

875
01:15:40,147 --> 01:15:41,845
I promise.

876
01:15:50,063 --> 01:15:53,001
Now, be brave...

877
01:15:53,796 --> 01:15:55,777
and don't look back.

878
01:15:56,575 --> 01:15:58,438
Don't look back.

879
01:16:42,791 --> 01:16:43,864
Qui-Gon, sir, wait!

880
01:16:43,994 --> 01:16:45,728
- I'm tired!
- Anakin! Drop!

881
01:16:48,184 --> 01:16:49,127
Go!

882
01:16:50,175 --> 01:16:52,073
Tell them to take off!

883
01:17:04,613 --> 01:17:06,063
Qui-Gon's in trouble.

884
01:17:07,351 --> 01:17:08,718
Take off.

885
01:17:09,425 --> 01:17:11,159
Over there. Fly low.

886
01:17:32,657 --> 01:17:35,641
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

887
01:17:35,768 --> 01:17:37,301
What was it?

888
01:17:37,427 --> 01:17:39,161
I'm not sure...

889
01:17:39,294 --> 01:17:41,818
but it was well-trained
in theJedi arts.

890
01:17:42,074 --> 01:17:44,433
My guess is
it was after the queen.

891
01:17:44,563 --> 01:17:47,040
What are we gonna do about it?

892
01:17:49,002 --> 01:17:50,617
We shall be patient.

893
01:17:50,745 --> 01:17:51,853
Anakin Skywalker...

894
01:17:51,989 --> 01:17:53,770
meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.

895
01:17:56,179 --> 01:17:58,703
You're aJedi too?
Pleased to meet you.

896
01:18:07,629 --> 01:18:10,153
Your queen is lost,
your people are starving...

897
01:18:10,284 --> 01:18:12,265
and you, Governor,
are going to die...

898
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,511
much sooner than your people,
I'm afraid.

899
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:17,117
This invasion
will gain you nothing.

900
01:18:17,254 --> 01:18:20,238
We're a democracy.
The people have decided.

901
01:18:20,365 --> 01:18:22,229
Take him away.

902
01:18:25,676 --> 01:18:28,118
My troops are in position
to begin searching the swamps...

903
01:18:28,248 --> 01:18:30,772
for these rumoured
underwater villages.

904
01:18:30,903 --> 01:18:33,510
They will not
stay hidden for long.

905
01:18:44,510 --> 01:18:47,200
The death toll is catastrophic.

906
01:18:47,331 --> 01:18:49,938
We mustbow to their wishes.

907
01:18:50,069 --> 01:18:52,263
You must contactme.

908
01:19:06,332 --> 01:19:08,230
You all right?

909
01:19:09,277 --> 01:19:11,175
It's very cold.

910
01:19:19,109 --> 01:19:21,845
You come from
a warm planet, Ani.

911
01:19:21,971 --> 01:19:24,331
A little too warm
for my taste.

912
01:19:24,461 --> 01:19:26,690
Space is cold.

913
01:19:26,826 --> 01:19:28,937
You seem sad.

914
01:19:30,103 --> 01:19:32,332
The queen is worried.

915
01:19:32,468 --> 01:19:34,862
Her people are suffering, dying.

916
01:19:34,998 --> 01:19:38,478
She must convince the senate
to intervene or...

917
01:19:39,935 --> 01:19:42,212
I'm not sure what'll happen.

918
01:19:43,669 --> 01:19:45,697
I made this foryou...

919
01:19:47,195 --> 01:19:49,058
so you'd remember me.

920
01:19:49,767 --> 01:19:52,421
I carved it
out of a japor snippet.

921
01:19:52,547 --> 01:19:55,366
It'll bring you good fortune.

922
01:19:55,492 --> 01:19:57,355
It's beautiful.

923
01:19:57,483 --> 01:19:59,842
But I don't need this
to rememberyou by.

924
01:20:03,499 --> 01:20:06,849
Many things will change
when we reach the capital, Ani...

925
01:20:06,984 --> 01:20:09,508
but my caring foryou will remain.

926
01:20:12,211 --> 01:20:15,313
I care foryou, too, only l--

927
01:20:15,447 --> 01:20:17,593
Miss your mother.

928
01:20:35,982 --> 01:20:40,123
Coruscant.
The entire planet is one big city.

929
01:20:40,255 --> 01:20:41,989
There's Chancellor Valorum's shuttle.

930
01:20:42,122 --> 01:20:45,355
And look over there.
Senator Palpatine is waiting for us.

931
01:21:14,688 --> 01:21:17,708
It is a great gift
to see you alive, Your Majesty.

932
01:21:17,841 --> 01:21:20,779
With the communications breakdown,
we've been very concerned.

933
01:21:20,911 --> 01:21:23,354
I'm anxious to hearyour report
on the situation.

934
01:21:23,484 --> 01:21:26,091
May I present
Supreme Chancellor Valorum.

935
01:21:26,222 --> 01:21:28,168
Welcome, Your Highness.

936
01:21:28,296 --> 01:21:30,324
It's an honour to finally
meet you in person.

937
01:21:30,453 --> 01:21:31,903
Thankyou, Supreme Chancellor.

938
01:21:32,029 --> 01:21:35,509
I must relay to you how distressed
everyone is over the current situation.

939
01:21:35,639 --> 01:21:39,036
I've called for a special session
of the senate to hearyour position.

940
01:21:40,202 --> 01:21:43,270
I'm grateful foryour concern,
Chancellor.

941
01:21:43,397 --> 01:21:45,260
There is a question
of procedure...

942
01:21:45,388 --> 01:21:47,865
but I'm confident
we can overcome it.

943
01:21:48,707 --> 01:21:50,853
I must speak with theJedi Council
immediately.

944
01:21:50,988 --> 01:21:53,760
The situation has become
much more complicated.

945
01:21:59,493 --> 01:22:01,391
Ani, come on.

946
01:22:12,561 --> 01:22:15,251
Da queen's a bein grossly nice,
mesa tinks.

947
01:22:16,585 --> 01:22:18,531
Pitty hot.

948
01:22:46,289 --> 01:22:49,391
There is no civility,
only politics.

949
01:22:50,687 --> 01:22:54,533
The Republic
is not what it once was.

950
01:22:54,669 --> 01:22:59,883
The senate is full of greedy,
squabbling delegates.

951
01:23:00,684 --> 01:23:04,082
There is no interest
in the common good.

952
01:23:04,958 --> 01:23:06,573
I must be frank, Your Majesty.

953
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:09,390
There is little chance the senate
will act on the invasion.

954
01:23:09,521 --> 01:23:12,211
Chancellor Valorum
seems to think there is hope.

955
01:23:12,342 --> 01:23:14,205
If I may say so, Your Majesty...

956
01:23:14,333 --> 01:23:16,527
the chancellor
has little real power.

957
01:23:16,656 --> 01:23:20,502
He is mired by baseless
accusations of corruption.

958
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:24,368
- The bureaucrats are in charge now.
- What options have we?

959
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:27,975
Our best choice would be
to push for the election...

960
01:23:28,107 --> 01:23:30,301
of a stronger
supreme chancellor...

961
01:23:30,430 --> 01:23:32,576
one who could control
the bureaucrats...

962
01:23:32,711 --> 01:23:34,527
and give usjustice.

963
01:23:35,408 --> 01:23:40,882
You could call for a vote of
no confidence in Chancellor Valorum.

964
01:23:41,008 --> 01:23:43,486
He has been
our strongest supporter.

965
01:23:43,623 --> 01:23:48,802
Our only other choice would be
to submit a plea to the courts.

966
01:23:48,933 --> 01:23:52,248
The courts take even longer
to decide things than the senate.

967
01:23:53,164 --> 01:23:55,228
Our people are dying, Senator.

968
01:23:56,026 --> 01:23:59,010
We must do something quickly
to stop the Federation.

969
01:23:59,138 --> 01:24:01,615
To be realistic, Your Majesty...

970
01:24:01,751 --> 01:24:04,229
I think we're going to have to
accept Federation control...

971
01:24:04,366 --> 01:24:06,843
for the time being.

972
01:24:08,597 --> 01:24:10,661
That is something I cannot do.

973
01:24:17,972 --> 01:24:20,531
He was trained in theJedi arts.

974
01:24:20,669 --> 01:24:24,563
My only conclusion can be
that it was a Sith lord.

975
01:24:24,694 --> 01:24:26,061
Impossible.

976
01:24:26,187 --> 01:24:28,841
The Sith have been extinct
for a millennium.

977
01:24:28,966 --> 01:24:33,107
I do not believe the Sith could
have returned without us knowing.

978
01:24:34,110 --> 01:24:36,304
Hard to see,
the dark side is.

979
01:24:36,433 --> 01:24:39,288
We will use all our resources
to unravel this mystery.

980
01:24:39,420 --> 01:24:42,606
We will discover the identity
ofyour attacker.

981
01:24:42,740 --> 01:24:44,391
May the Force be with you.

982
01:24:48,423 --> 01:24:49,873
Master Qui-Gon.

983
01:24:50,746 --> 01:24:52,527
More to say have you?

984
01:24:54,646 --> 01:24:56,509
With your permission, my master...

985
01:24:58,047 --> 01:25:01,031
I have encountered
a vergence in the Force.

986
01:25:02,154 --> 01:25:04,136
A vergence, you say.

987
01:25:04,271 --> 01:25:06,382
Located around a person?

988
01:25:06,511 --> 01:25:07,749
A boy.

989
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:10,357
His cells have the highest
concentration of midi-chlorians...

990
01:25:10,493 --> 01:25:12,274
I have seen in a life-form.

991
01:25:12,402 --> 01:25:15,257
It is possible he was conceived
by the midi-chlorians.

992
01:25:16,965 --> 01:25:20,811
You refer to the prophecy of the one
who will bring balance to the Force.

993
01:25:21,611 --> 01:25:23,723
You believe it's this boy?

994
01:25:23,852 --> 01:25:26,411
- I don't presume to--
- But you do.

995
01:25:27,171 --> 01:25:29,117
Revealed your opinion is.

996
01:25:29,245 --> 01:25:31,273
I request the boy be tested,
Master.

997
01:25:33,393 --> 01:25:36,578
Trained as aJedi
you request for him, hmm?

998
01:25:36,712 --> 01:25:39,071
Finding him
was the will of the Force.

999
01:25:39,201 --> 01:25:41,430
I have no doubt of that.

1000
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:50,108
Bring him before us, then.

1001
01:26:01,147 --> 01:26:03,011
The boy's here to see Padmé.

1002
01:26:03,139 --> 01:26:04,708
Lethim in.

1003
01:26:07,910 --> 01:26:11,756
I'm sorry, Ani, but Padmé's
not here right now.

1004
01:26:11,892 --> 01:26:13,543
Who is it?

1005
01:26:14,340 --> 01:26:17,324
Anakin Skywalker to see Padmé,
Your Highness.

1006
01:26:17,451 --> 01:26:19,232
I've sent Padmé on an errand.

1007
01:26:19,359 --> 01:26:21,222
I'm on my way
to theJedi temple...

1008
01:26:21,351 --> 01:26:23,581
to start my training, I hope.

1009
01:26:24,421 --> 01:26:28,232
I may never see her again,
so I came to say goodbye.

1010
01:26:29,316 --> 01:26:32,914
We will tell her foryou.
We are sure her heart goes with you.

1011
01:26:34,046 --> 01:26:35,071
Thankyou, Your Highness.

1012
01:26:49,022 --> 01:26:53,080
The chair recognizes the senator
from the sovereign system of Naboo.

1013
01:26:59,849 --> 01:27:03,200
Supreme Chancellor,
delegates of the senate...

1014
01:27:04,331 --> 01:27:06,690
a tragedy has occurred...

1015
01:27:06,820 --> 01:27:10,300
which started right here
with the taxation of trade routes...

1016
01:27:10,429 --> 01:27:13,413
and has now engulfed
our entire planet...

1017
01:27:13,540 --> 01:27:15,521
in the oppression
of the Trade Federation.

1018
01:27:16,402 --> 01:27:17,805
This is outrageous!

1019
01:27:17,937 --> 01:27:20,461
I object
to the senator's statements.

1020
01:27:20,592 --> 01:27:24,615
The chair does not recognize the senator
from the Trade Federation at this time.

1021
01:27:24,742 --> 01:27:28,588
To state our allegations,
I present Queen Amidala...

1022
01:27:28,724 --> 01:27:30,705
recently elected
ruler of the Naboo...

1023
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:32,703
who speaks on our behalf.

1024
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:41,416
Honourable representatives
of the Republic...

1025
01:27:42,165 --> 01:27:44,608
I come to you under the gravest
of circumstances.

1026
01:27:44,738 --> 01:27:47,593
The Naboo system has been invaded
by the droid armies of the Trade--

1027
01:27:47,725 --> 01:27:51,240
I object!
There is no proof!

1028
01:27:51,375 --> 01:27:53,238
This is incredible.

1029
01:27:53,366 --> 01:27:57,294
We recommend a commission be sent
to Naboo to ascertain the truth.

1030
01:27:57,432 --> 01:27:58,705
The Congress of Malastare...

1031
01:27:58,842 --> 01:28:01,826
concurs with the honourable delegate
from the Trade Federation.

1032
01:28:01,953 --> 01:28:03,982
A commission must be appointed.

1033
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:06,589
- The point--
- Excuse me, Chancellor.

1034
01:28:06,725 --> 01:28:08,340
Enter the bureaucrat.

1035
01:28:08,467 --> 01:28:11,074
The true rulers of the Republic.

1036
01:28:11,205 --> 01:28:15,346
And on the payroll
of the Trade Federation, I might add.

1037
01:28:15,478 --> 01:28:19,666
This is where Chancellor Valorum's
strength will disappear.

1038
01:28:21,244 --> 01:28:23,521
The point is conceded.

1039
01:28:23,651 --> 01:28:26,258
Will you deferyour motion
to allow a commission...

1040
01:28:26,389 --> 01:28:29,161
to explore the validity
ofyour accusations?

1041
01:28:29,293 --> 01:28:31,156
I will not defer.

1042
01:28:31,284 --> 01:28:34,764
I've come before you to resolve
this attack on our sovereignty now.

1043
01:28:34,894 --> 01:28:37,878
I was not elected to watch
my people suffer and die...

1044
01:28:38,005 --> 01:28:40,659
while you discuss this invasion
in a committee.

1045
01:28:43,606 --> 01:28:45,918
If this body
is not capable of action...

1046
01:28:46,054 --> 01:28:48,082
I suggest new leadership is needed.

1047
01:28:51,488 --> 01:28:53,682
I move for a vote
of no confidence...

1048
01:28:53,811 --> 01:28:55,792
in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.

1049
01:29:02,814 --> 01:29:04,960
Vote now! Vote now!

1050
01:29:08,746 --> 01:29:10,644
Order!

1051
01:29:10,779 --> 01:29:13,634
Now they will elect
a new chancellor...

1052
01:29:13,766 --> 01:29:15,629
a strong chancellor...

1053
01:29:15,757 --> 01:29:18,658
one who will not
let our tragedy continue.

1054
01:29:20,362 --> 01:29:24,587
The boy will not pass the council's
test, Master. He's too old.

1055
01:29:24,718 --> 01:29:27,820
Anakin will become aJedi,
I promise you.

1056
01:29:27,954 --> 01:29:30,644
Do not defy the council,
Master, not again.

1057
01:29:30,775 --> 01:29:33,465
I shall do what I must, Obi-Wan.

1058
01:29:35,380 --> 01:29:39,108
Ifyou would just follow the code,
you would be on the council.

1059
01:29:39,238 --> 01:29:41,266
They will not go along
with you this time.

1060
01:29:42,765 --> 01:29:45,324
You still have much to learn,
myyoung apprentice.

1061
01:29:48,614 --> 01:29:49,981
A ship.

1062
01:29:51,601 --> 01:29:53,547
A cup.

1063
01:29:53,675 --> 01:29:55,456
A ship.

1064
01:29:56,579 --> 01:29:58,029
A speeder.

1065
01:30:05,540 --> 01:30:07,438
How feel you?

1066
01:30:08,029 --> 01:30:09,680
Cold, sir.

1067
01:30:11,348 --> 01:30:13,494
- Afraid are you?
- No, sir.

1068
01:30:14,667 --> 01:30:17,274
See through you we can.

1069
01:30:17,405 --> 01:30:19,268
Be mindful ofyour feelings.

1070
01:30:19,396 --> 01:30:22,132
Your thoughts dwell on your mother.

1071
01:30:23,794 --> 01:30:25,197
I miss her.

1072
01:30:26,449 --> 01:30:28,891
Afraid to lose her,
I think, mmm?

1073
01:30:29,021 --> 01:30:31,132
What has that got to do
with anything?

1074
01:30:31,261 --> 01:30:33,573
Everything.

1075
01:30:33,709 --> 01:30:36,729
Fear is the path to the dark side.

1076
01:30:36,862 --> 01:30:39,717
Fear leads to anger.
Anger leads to hate.

1077
01:30:39,848 --> 01:30:43,164
Hate leads to suffering.

1078
01:30:49,681 --> 01:30:52,582
I sense much fear in you.

1079
01:31:05,446 --> 01:31:08,796
Yousa tinking
yousa people ganna die?

1080
01:31:08,930 --> 01:31:10,251
I don't know.

1081
01:31:11,585 --> 01:31:13,448
Gungans get pasted too, eh?

1082
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:17,928
I hope not.

1083
01:31:18,721 --> 01:31:20,915
Gungans no die'n without a fight.

1084
01:31:21,044 --> 01:31:22,908
Wesa warriors.

1085
01:31:23,036 --> 01:31:26,268
Wesa got a grand army.

1086
01:31:26,396 --> 01:31:29,581
Dat's whyyou no liken us,
mesa tinks.

1087
01:31:29,715 --> 01:31:31,036
Your Highness?

1088
01:31:33,697 --> 01:31:35,808
Your Highness...

1089
01:31:35,937 --> 01:31:39,004
Senator Palpatine has been nominated
to succeed Valorum...

1090
01:31:39,132 --> 01:31:40,499
as supreme chancellor.

1091
01:31:40,625 --> 01:31:44,472
A surprise, to be sure,
but a welcome one.

1092
01:31:44,608 --> 01:31:48,961
Your Majesty, if I am elected,
I promise to put an end to corruption.

1093
01:31:49,089 --> 01:31:50,740
Who else has been nominated?

1094
01:31:50,872 --> 01:31:55,142
Bail Antilles ofAlderaan
and Ainlee Teem of Malastare.

1095
01:31:55,270 --> 01:32:00,154
I feel confident our situation will
create a strong sympathy vote for us.

1096
01:32:01,866 --> 01:32:03,848
I will be chancellor.

1097
01:32:03,982 --> 01:32:06,541
I fear by the time you have control
of the bureaucrats, Senator...

1098
01:32:06,679 --> 01:32:09,864
there'll be nothing left
of our people, our way of life.

1099
01:32:09,997 --> 01:32:11,860
I understand your concern,
Your Majesty.

1100
01:32:11,989 --> 01:32:15,504
Unfortunately, the Federation
has possession of our planet.

1101
01:32:17,299 --> 01:32:21,062
Senator, this is your arena.

1102
01:32:21,447 --> 01:32:23,346
I feel I must return to mine.

1103
01:32:26,592 --> 01:32:28,868
I've decided to go back to Naboo.

1104
01:32:28,998 --> 01:32:29,858
Go back?

1105
01:32:29,994 --> 01:32:32,932
But, Your Majesty, be realistic.
They'll force you to sign the treaty.

1106
01:32:33,063 --> 01:32:35,422
I will sign no treaty, Senator.

1107
01:32:35,552 --> 01:32:38,324
My fate will be no different
than that of our people.

1108
01:32:38,456 --> 01:32:40,025
- Captain.
- Your Highness.

1109
01:32:40,157 --> 01:32:42,433
- Ready my ship.
- Please, Your Majesty.

1110
01:32:42,563 --> 01:32:44,427
Stay here where it's safe.

1111
01:32:45,924 --> 01:32:49,073
It is clear to me now that
the Republic no longer functions.

1112
01:32:49,824 --> 01:32:53,929
I prayyou will bring sanity
and compassion back to the senate.

1113
01:33:03,597 --> 01:33:06,156
The Force is strong with him.

1114
01:33:06,294 --> 01:33:08,192
He is to be trained, then?

1115
01:33:10,318 --> 01:33:12,677
No, he will not be trained.

1116
01:33:12,807 --> 01:33:14,458
No?

1117
01:33:16,499 --> 01:33:18,527
He is too old.

1118
01:33:18,656 --> 01:33:22,419
He is the chosen one.
You must see it.

1119
01:33:23,593 --> 01:33:27,108
Clouded this boy's future is.

1120
01:33:29,318 --> 01:33:31,134
I will train him, then.

1121
01:33:35,458 --> 01:33:38,277
I take Anakin
as my Padawan learner.

1122
01:33:38,403 --> 01:33:41,304
An apprentice you have, Qui-Gon.

1123
01:33:41,431 --> 01:33:43,791
Impossible to take on a second.

1124
01:33:43,921 --> 01:33:45,572
The code forbids it.

1125
01:33:45,705 --> 01:33:49,055
- Obi-Wan is ready.
- I am ready to face the trials.

1126
01:33:49,190 --> 01:33:52,788
Our own counsel we will keep
on who is ready.

1127
01:33:53,795 --> 01:33:56,402
He is headstrong and he has much
to learn of the living Force...

1128
01:33:56,532 --> 01:33:58,230
but he is capable.

1129
01:33:58,358 --> 01:34:00,339
There is little more
he can learn from me.

1130
01:34:02,922 --> 01:34:06,685
Young Skywalker's fate
will be decided later.

1131
01:34:06,821 --> 01:34:09,380
Now is not the time for this.

1132
01:34:10,182 --> 01:34:12,128
The senate is voting
for a new supreme chancellor...

1133
01:34:12,256 --> 01:34:14,910
and Queen Amidala
is returning home...

1134
01:34:15,035 --> 01:34:18,220
which puts pressure on the Federation
and could widen the confrontation.

1135
01:34:18,354 --> 01:34:20,630
And draw out the queen's attacker.

1136
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:25,114
Go with the queen to Naboo and discover
the identity of this dark warrior.

1137
01:34:26,403 --> 01:34:27,936
This is the clue we need...

1138
01:34:28,062 --> 01:34:30,621
to unravel
the mystery of the Sith.

1139
01:34:31,339 --> 01:34:33,533
May the Force be with you.

1140
01:34:46,648 --> 01:34:49,503
It's not disrespect, Master.
It's the truth.

1141
01:34:49,635 --> 01:34:51,498
From your point ofview.

1142
01:34:51,626 --> 01:34:54,976
The boy is dangerous.
They all sense it. Why can't you?

1143
01:34:55,110 --> 01:34:57,965
His fate is uncertain.
He's not dangerous.

1144
01:34:58,097 --> 01:35:00,456
The council will decide
Anakin's future.

1145
01:35:00,586 --> 01:35:03,488
That should be enough foryou.
Now get on board.

1146
01:35:09,133 --> 01:35:12,861
Qui-Gon, sir,
I don't want to be a problem.

1147
01:35:12,991 --> 01:35:15,185
You won't be, Ani.

1148
01:35:15,314 --> 01:35:17,212
I'm not allowed to train you...

1149
01:35:17,347 --> 01:35:19,375
so I want you to watch me
and be mindful.

1150
01:35:19,504 --> 01:35:21,568
Always remember:

1151
01:35:22,491 --> 01:35:25,099
Your focus determines your reality.

1152
01:35:25,230 --> 01:35:28,793
Stay close to me
and you'll be safe.

1153
01:35:28,922 --> 01:35:30,289
Master, sir...

1154
01:35:30,415 --> 01:35:33,978
I heard Yoda talking
about midi-chlorians.

1155
01:35:34,107 --> 01:35:37,587
I've been wondering--
What are midi-chlorians?

1156
01:35:38,878 --> 01:35:41,237
Midi-chlorians are
a microscopic life-form...

1157
01:35:41,367 --> 01:35:43,597
that resides
within all living cells.

1158
01:35:45,060 --> 01:35:47,915
- They live inside me?
- Inside your cells, yes.

1159
01:35:48,047 --> 01:35:51,479
- And we are symbionts with them.
- Symbionts?

1160
01:35:51,614 --> 01:35:55,460
Life-forms living together
for mutual advantage.

1161
01:35:55,597 --> 01:35:58,452
Without the midi-chlorians,
life could not exist...

1162
01:35:58,583 --> 01:36:01,355
and we would have
no knowledge of the Force.

1163
01:36:01,487 --> 01:36:03,351
They continually speak to us...

1164
01:36:03,480 --> 01:36:06,134
telling us the will of the Force.

1165
01:36:06,259 --> 01:36:08,323
When you learn
to quiet your mind...

1166
01:36:08,458 --> 01:36:10,321
you'll hear them speaking to you.

1167
01:36:10,449 --> 01:36:12,312
I don't understand.

1168
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:15,920
With time and training, Ani,
you will. You will.

1169
01:36:19,949 --> 01:36:23,678
Your Majesty, it is our pleasure
to continue to serve and protect you.

1170
01:36:24,388 --> 01:36:25,791
I welcome your help.

1171
01:36:25,923 --> 01:36:29,603
Senator Palpatine fears that
the Federation means to destroy me.

1172
01:36:29,740 --> 01:36:32,724
I assure you I will not
allow that to happen.

1173
01:36:32,851 --> 01:36:35,706
Wesa goin' home!

1174
01:36:35,838 --> 01:36:37,701
Come on, R2.

1175
01:36:47,911 --> 01:36:50,270
Is theplanetsecure?

1176
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:54,246
We have taken over the last pockets
of primitive life-forms.

1177
01:36:54,382 --> 01:36:57,449
We are in complete control
of the planet now.

1178
01:36:57,576 --> 01:37:00,725
Good. I willsee to it
thatin thesenate...

1179
01:37:00,853 --> 01:37:03,755
thingsstayas theyare.

1180
01:37:03,883 --> 01:37:07,363
Iamsendingmy apprentice,
Darth Maul, tojoinyou.

1181
01:37:07,492 --> 01:37:09,355
Yes, my lord.

1182
01:37:09,483 --> 01:37:11,346
A Sith here?

1183
01:37:16,743 --> 01:37:19,185
Those are the forward stabilizers.

1184
01:37:19,315 --> 01:37:21,674
And those two control the pitch?

1185
01:37:23,257 --> 01:37:25,120
You catch on pretty quick.

1186
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:26,982
As soon as we land...

1187
01:37:27,115 --> 01:37:29,722
the Federation will arrest you
and force you to sign the treaty.

1188
01:37:29,853 --> 01:37:30,878
I agree.

1189
01:37:31,014 --> 01:37:33,750
I'm not sure what you wish
to accomplish by this.

1190
01:37:33,876 --> 01:37:36,318
I will take back what's ours.

1191
01:37:37,112 --> 01:37:39,258
There are too few of us,
Your Highness.

1192
01:37:39,394 --> 01:37:41,257
We have no army.

1193
01:37:41,385 --> 01:37:42,752
And I can only protect you.

1194
01:37:42,878 --> 01:37:44,907
I can't fight a war foryou.

1195
01:37:45,949 --> 01:37:46,974
JarJar Binks.

1196
01:37:47,899 --> 01:37:50,045
Mesa, Your Highness?

1197
01:37:50,181 --> 01:37:53,082
Yes. I need your help.

1198
01:37:58,311 --> 01:38:00,505
I have one battleship on my scope.

1199
01:38:00,634 --> 01:38:02,662
It's a droid control ship.

1200
01:38:02,792 --> 01:38:04,987
They've probably spotted us.

1201
01:38:05,116 --> 01:38:06,814
We haven't much time.

1202
01:38:18,473 --> 01:38:21,127
JarJar is on his way
to the Gungan city, Master.

1203
01:38:21,253 --> 01:38:22,526
Good.

1204
01:38:22,663 --> 01:38:24,893
Do you think
the queen's idea will work?

1205
01:38:25,029 --> 01:38:26,644
The Gungans will not
be easily swayed.

1206
01:38:28,721 --> 01:38:31,033
And we cannot use our power
to help her.

1207
01:38:32,828 --> 01:38:35,895
I'm sorry for
my behaviour, Master.

1208
01:38:36,022 --> 01:38:39,702
It's not my place to disagree
with you about the boy.

1209
01:38:41,622 --> 01:38:44,890
And I am grateful you think
I'm ready to take the trials.

1210
01:38:46,062 --> 01:38:47,925
You've been a good apprentice,
Obi-Wan.

1211
01:38:49,381 --> 01:38:52,035
And you're a much wiser man
than I am.

1212
01:38:52,741 --> 01:38:56,056
I foresee you will become
a greatJedi knight.

1213
01:39:09,004 --> 01:39:11,363
Desa nobody dare!

1214
01:39:11,493 --> 01:39:13,639
The Gungan city is deserted!

1215
01:39:13,774 --> 01:39:16,298
Some kinda fight, mesa tinks.

1216
01:39:16,429 --> 01:39:19,496
Do you think they have been taken
to the camps?

1217
01:39:19,623 --> 01:39:21,935
More likely they were wiped out.

1218
01:39:22,071 --> 01:39:25,092
- Mesa no tink so.
- Do you know where they are,JarJar?

1219
01:39:25,225 --> 01:39:28,622
When in trouble,
Gungans go to sacred place.

1220
01:39:28,751 --> 01:39:31,606
Mesa showyou.
Come on. Mesa showyou!

1221
01:39:49,867 --> 01:39:53,430
Your Honour,
Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1222
01:40:00,072 --> 01:40:03,388
Heyo dadee
Big Boss Nass, Your Honour.

1223
01:40:04,180 --> 01:40:06,574
JarJar Binks.

1224
01:40:07,084 --> 01:40:10,316
Who's da uss-en uthers?

1225
01:40:10,900 --> 01:40:13,176
I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1226
01:40:14,011 --> 01:40:16,405
I come before you in peace.

1227
01:40:16,542 --> 01:40:19,361
Ah, Naboo biggen.

1228
01:40:19,487 --> 01:40:22,636
Yousa bringen da Mackineeks.

1229
01:40:22,764 --> 01:40:26,445
Yousa all bombad.

1230
01:40:27,329 --> 01:40:30,148
We have searched you out
because we wish to form an alliance.

1231
01:40:30,274 --> 01:40:31,641
Your Honour.

1232
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:36,738
Whosa dis?

1233
01:40:36,870 --> 01:40:39,064
I am Queen Amidala.

1234
01:40:40,728 --> 01:40:42,297
This is my decoy...

1235
01:40:42,429 --> 01:40:46,028
my protection,
my loyal bodyguard.

1236
01:40:46,163 --> 01:40:50,433
I'm sorry for my deception,
but it was necessary to protect myself.

1237
01:40:50,561 --> 01:40:53,085
Although we do not always agree,
Your Honour...

1238
01:40:53,215 --> 01:40:55,739
our two great societies
have always lived in peace.

1239
01:40:57,530 --> 01:41:00,679
The Trade Federation has destroyed all
that we have worked so hard to build.

1240
01:41:00,807 --> 01:41:04,040
Ifwe do not act quickly,
all will be lost forever.

1241
01:41:04,168 --> 01:41:06,362
I askyou to help us.

1242
01:41:06,491 --> 01:41:09,181
No, I beg you to help us.

1243
01:41:09,312 --> 01:41:11,671
We are your humble servants.

1244
01:41:14,912 --> 01:41:17,684
Our fate is in your hands.

1245
01:41:34,826 --> 01:41:39,050
Yousa no tinken yousa
greater den da Gungans?

1246
01:41:41,504 --> 01:41:45,398
Mesa lika dis!

1247
01:41:46,442 --> 01:41:47,302
Maybe...

1248
01:41:47,438 --> 01:41:49,962
wesa...

1249
01:41:50,093 --> 01:41:51,956
being friends.

1250
01:42:00,629 --> 01:42:02,410
We've sent our patrols.

1251
01:42:02,538 --> 01:42:05,971
We already located
their starship in the swamp.

1252
01:42:06,106 --> 01:42:08,252
It won't be long, my lord.

1253
01:42:08,388 --> 01:42:11,490
This is
an unexpectedmove forher.

1254
01:42:11,624 --> 01:42:13,605
It's too aggressive.

1255
01:42:13,739 --> 01:42:16,133
Lord Maul, be mindful.

1256
01:42:16,270 --> 01:42:18,794
Let them make the firstmove.

1257
01:42:18,925 --> 01:42:20,788
Yes, my master.

1258
01:42:24,319 --> 01:42:25,970
Deysa comin!

1259
01:42:26,102 --> 01:42:27,423
All right!

1260
01:42:30,998 --> 01:42:32,696
They're here!

1261
01:42:32,823 --> 01:42:34,190
Good. They made it.

1262
01:42:38,755 --> 01:42:41,409
Yousa doen grand.

1263
01:42:41,534 --> 01:42:44,602
JarJar bring uss-en
and da Naboo together.

1264
01:42:44,730 --> 01:42:46,593
Oh, no, no, no.

1265
01:42:46,721 --> 01:42:49,659
So, wesa make you...

1266
01:42:49,791 --> 01:42:52,268
bombad general.

1267
01:42:52,404 --> 01:42:53,807
General?

1268
01:42:56,884 --> 01:42:58,334
Captain.

1269
01:42:58,461 --> 01:43:01,020
- Your Highness.
- What is the situation?

1270
01:43:01,157 --> 01:43:03,020
Almost everyone's in camps.

1271
01:43:03,148 --> 01:43:06,334
A few hundred police and guards formed
an underground resistance movement.

1272
01:43:06,468 --> 01:43:08,992
I brought back as many
of the leaders as I could.

1273
01:43:09,123 --> 01:43:11,978
The Federation army's also
much larger than we thought...

1274
01:43:12,110 --> 01:43:13,761
and much stronger.

1275
01:43:15,055 --> 01:43:18,122
Your Highness, this is a battle
I do not think that we can win.

1276
01:43:18,249 --> 01:43:20,443
The battle is a diversion.

1277
01:43:20,572 --> 01:43:23,428
The Gungans must draw the droid army
away from the cities.

1278
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:25,093
R2.

1279
01:43:26,215 --> 01:43:29,647
We can enter the city using the secret
passages on the waterfall side.

1280
01:43:29,783 --> 01:43:31,481
Once we get
to the main entrance...

1281
01:43:31,608 --> 01:43:34,675
Captain Panaka
will create a diversion.

1282
01:43:34,802 --> 01:43:37,703
Then we can enter the palace
and capture the viceroy.

1283
01:43:38,453 --> 01:43:41,225
Without the viceroy,
they will be lost and confused.

1284
01:43:41,357 --> 01:43:43,008
What do you think, MasterJedi?

1285
01:43:43,141 --> 01:43:45,288
The viceroy will be well-guarded.

1286
01:43:45,423 --> 01:43:47,900
The difficulty is getting
into the throne room.

1287
01:43:48,037 --> 01:43:50,313
Once we're inside,
we shouldn't have a problem.

1288
01:43:50,443 --> 01:43:55,126
There is a possibility, with this
diversion, many Gungans will be killed.

1289
01:43:55,255 --> 01:43:58,522
Wesa ready to do our-san part.

1290
01:43:58,657 --> 01:44:01,759
We have a plan which should
immobilize the droid army.

1291
01:44:01,892 --> 01:44:03,756
We will send
what pilots we have...

1292
01:44:03,884 --> 01:44:06,904
to knock out the droid control ship
orbiting the planet.

1293
01:44:07,037 --> 01:44:10,057
A well-conceived plan.
However, there's great risk.

1294
01:44:10,190 --> 01:44:13,292
The weapons on your fighters
may not penetrate the shields.

1295
01:44:13,426 --> 01:44:15,041
There's an even bigger danger.

1296
01:44:15,168 --> 01:44:17,031
If the viceroy escapes,
Your Highness...

1297
01:44:17,159 --> 01:44:19,353
he will return
with another droid army.

1298
01:44:19,482 --> 01:44:22,667
Well, that is why we must not fail
to get the viceroy.

1299
01:44:22,801 --> 01:44:24,700
Everything depends on it.

1300
01:44:30,020 --> 01:44:32,627
She ismore foolish
than I thought.

1301
01:44:32,758 --> 01:44:34,704
We are sending all troops...

1302
01:44:34,832 --> 01:44:37,687
to meet this army
assembling near the swamp.

1303
01:44:37,819 --> 01:44:40,426
It appears to be made up
of primitives.

1304
01:44:40,557 --> 01:44:43,081
This will work to ouradvantage.

1305
01:44:43,212 --> 01:44:45,985
I have your approval
to proceed, then, my lord?

1306
01:44:46,781 --> 01:44:48,479
Wipe them out.

1307
01:44:50,182 --> 01:44:52,045
Allofthem.

1308
01:45:22,789 --> 01:45:24,157
Halt!

1309
01:45:27,603 --> 01:45:29,832
Starting up the shield.

1310
01:45:59,214 --> 01:46:00,405
Open fire.

1311
01:46:16,431 --> 01:46:19,616
Once we get inside, you find
a safe place to hide and stay there.

1312
01:46:19,749 --> 01:46:21,647
- Sure.
- Stay there.

1313
01:46:37,547 --> 01:46:39,575
Roger, roger.

1314
01:46:47,587 --> 01:46:50,689
I thought the battle was going
to take place far from here.

1315
01:46:51,777 --> 01:46:53,263
This is too close.

1316
01:46:59,202 --> 01:47:01,561
Ani, find cover.

1317
01:47:01,691 --> 01:47:03,968
- Quick!
- Get to your ships!

1318
01:48:02,427 --> 01:48:03,535
Fighters straight ahead.

1319
01:48:03,672 --> 01:48:04,780
Roger, Bravo Leader.

1320
01:48:04,917 --> 01:48:06,108
Roger, Bravo Leader.

1321
01:48:14,748 --> 01:48:15,821
Cease fire.

1322
01:48:23,335 --> 01:48:25,730
Steady. Steady.

1323
01:48:58,681 --> 01:49:01,866
- Activate the droids.
- Yes, sir.

1324
01:49:18,304 --> 01:49:20,202
Ouch time.

1325
01:49:34,235 --> 01:49:35,308
Fire!

1326
01:49:57,467 --> 01:49:59,283
My guess is the viceroy's
in the throne room.

1327
01:49:59,417 --> 01:50:00,867
Red group! Blue group!

1328
01:50:00,993 --> 01:50:02,774
Everybody, this way!

1329
01:50:02,901 --> 01:50:04,930
Hey, wait for me!

1330
01:50:05,059 --> 01:50:07,418
Anakin, stay where you are.
You'll be safe there.

1331
01:50:07,548 --> 01:50:09,529
- But l--
- Stay in that cockpit.

1332
01:50:21,653 --> 01:50:24,839
- We'll handle this.
- We'll take the long way.

1333
01:50:44,927 --> 01:50:46,825
We gotta do something, R2.

1334
01:51:09,528 --> 01:51:12,512
I'm trying to!
I don't know where the trigger is!

1335
01:51:15,958 --> 01:51:18,978
Oops, wrong one.
Maybe it's this one.

1336
01:51:19,982 --> 01:51:20,355
Nope. Wait. Here it is.

1337
01:51:20,355 --> 01:51:22,419
Nope. Wait. Here it is.

1338
01:51:24,629 --> 01:51:25,572
Yeah!

1339
01:51:30,935 --> 01:51:32,421
Let's go!

1340
01:51:33,507 --> 01:51:35,736
It's on automatic pilot.

1341
01:51:44,791 --> 01:51:46,654
Try to override it.

1342
01:52:46,397 --> 01:52:48,295
We don't have time for this,
Captain.

1343
01:52:54,404 --> 01:52:56,220
Look, there they are.

1344
01:52:56,353 --> 01:52:58,712
That's where
the autopilot's taking us.

1345
01:53:15,644 --> 01:53:18,251
Dumb droid. Take that!

1346
01:53:18,382 --> 01:53:20,280
Get off! Get off! Get off!

1347
01:53:20,415 --> 01:53:21,571
Get off!

1348
01:53:31,575 --> 01:53:33,934
The deflector shield
is too strong.

1349
01:53:43,190 --> 01:53:44,842
This is tense!

1350
01:53:47,132 --> 01:53:49,113
R2, get us off this autopilot.

1351
01:53:49,248 --> 01:53:51,111
It's gonna get us both killed.

1352
01:53:52,774 --> 01:53:55,168
You did it, R2!

1353
01:53:55,305 --> 01:53:56,496
Let's go left.

1354
01:54:01,693 --> 01:54:02,801
Go back?

1355
01:54:02,938 --> 01:54:07,209
Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit,
so that's what I'm gonna do.

1356
01:54:14,056 --> 01:54:16,498
I'll try spinning.
That's a good trick.

1357
01:54:22,146 --> 01:54:24,671
I know we're in trouble.
Just hang on.

1358
01:54:31,480 --> 01:54:32,470
Go!

1359
01:54:37,288 --> 01:54:38,986
Ascension guns!

1360
01:56:44,484 --> 01:56:46,099
Retreat! Retreat!

1361
01:56:47,844 --> 01:56:49,742
Dis is nutsen.

1362
01:56:59,584 --> 01:57:01,530
Uh-oh. Big boomers.

1363
01:57:22,152 --> 01:57:24,547
Give me a lift!

1364
01:57:31,778 --> 01:57:33,347
JarJar, usen da booma!

1365
01:57:33,478 --> 01:57:35,376
What?
Mesa no have a booma!

1366
01:57:35,511 --> 01:57:37,457
Here. Taken dis one.

1367
01:57:53,806 --> 01:57:54,879
JarJar!

1368
01:57:55,009 --> 01:57:56,955
Jump,JarJar, jump!

1369
01:58:07,082 --> 01:58:09,854
Put down your weapons.
They win this round.

1370
01:58:22,721 --> 01:58:24,833
We're hit, R2!

1371
01:58:37,988 --> 01:58:40,926
I'm trying to stop!
I'm trying to stop!

1372
01:58:48,111 --> 01:58:49,644
Everything's overheated.

1373
01:58:51,098 --> 01:58:53,044
Oops. This is not good.

1374
02:00:05,109 --> 02:00:07,303
No giben up, General JarJar.

1375
02:00:07,432 --> 02:00:09,295
Mesa think of something.

1376
02:00:09,423 --> 02:00:10,790
Hands up.

1377
02:00:10,917 --> 02:00:13,772
My give up. My give up.

1378
02:00:22,449 --> 02:00:25,553
Your little insurrection
is at an end, Your Highness.

1379
02:00:25,686 --> 02:00:27,549
Time foryou
to sign the treaty and end...

1380
02:00:27,677 --> 02:00:29,540
this pointless debate in the senate.

1381
02:00:29,669 --> 02:00:31,403
Viceroy!

1382
02:00:31,535 --> 02:00:33,433
Your occupation here has ended.

1383
02:00:35,020 --> 02:00:38,370
After her.
This one's a decoy.

1384
02:00:44,936 --> 02:00:46,386
Captain!

1385
02:00:55,597 --> 02:00:57,625
Jam the doors.

1386
02:01:01,073 --> 02:01:03,928
Now, Viceroy,
we will discuss a new treaty.

1387
02:02:06,787 --> 02:02:09,264
Yes! We have power.
Shields up.

1388
02:02:12,553 --> 02:02:13,578
Take this!

1389
02:02:15,581 --> 02:02:16,654
And this!

1390
02:02:24,501 --> 02:02:26,235
- Oops.
- We're losing power.

1391
02:02:26,368 --> 02:02:28,184
There seems to be a problem
with the main reactor.

1392
02:02:28,318 --> 02:02:29,685
Impossible!

1393
02:02:29,811 --> 02:02:31,674
Nothing can get through our shield.

1394
02:02:32,964 --> 02:02:34,745
Let's get outta here.

1395
02:02:42,754 --> 02:02:45,362
What's that?
It's blowing up from the inside!

1396
02:02:48,397 --> 02:02:49,966
We didn't hit it.

1397
02:02:53,043 --> 02:02:55,071
Now, this is Podracing.

1398
02:02:56,694 --> 02:02:58,392
Look, one of ours,
out of the main hold!

1399
02:03:19,677 --> 02:03:21,127
What the--

1400
02:03:21,253 --> 02:03:23,447
Was'n they doing?

1401
02:03:23,576 --> 02:03:27,140
The control ship
has been destroyed. Look!

1402
02:03:28,846 --> 02:03:31,158
They all broke-ed.

1403
02:04:19,333 --> 02:04:22,683
No, it's too late.

1404
02:04:22,818 --> 02:04:25,095
- No.
- Obi-Wan.

1405
02:04:26,386 --> 02:04:28,249
Promise--

1406
02:04:28,378 --> 02:04:30,902
Promise me
you will train the boy.

1407
02:04:31,033 --> 02:04:32,566
Yes, Master.

1408
02:04:36,633 --> 02:04:39,192
He is the chosen one.

1409
02:04:39,329 --> 02:04:42,514
He will bring balance.

1410
02:04:43,727 --> 02:04:45,131
Train him.

1411
02:05:12,518 --> 02:05:14,299
Now, Viceroy...

1412
02:05:14,426 --> 02:05:17,823
you're going to have to go back
to the senate and explain all this.

1413
02:05:19,570 --> 02:05:22,837
I thinkyou can kiss
your trade franchise goodbye.

1414
02:05:36,497 --> 02:05:40,012
We are indebted to you
foryour bravery, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

1415
02:05:40,147 --> 02:05:42,010
And you, young Skywalker.

1416
02:05:42,802 --> 02:05:46,070
We will watch your career
with great interest.

1417
02:05:52,593 --> 02:05:55,117
Congratulations on your election,
Chancellor.

1418
02:05:55,248 --> 02:05:58,645
Your boldness has saved our people,
Your Majesty.

1419
02:05:58,774 --> 02:06:01,133
It's you who should be
congratulated.

1420
02:06:01,264 --> 02:06:05,158
Together we shall bring peace
and prosperity to the Republic.

1421
02:06:10,184 --> 02:06:14,572
Confer on you the level
ofJedi knight the council does.

1422
02:06:14,705 --> 02:06:19,388
But agree with your taking this boy
as your Padawan learner...

1423
02:06:19,517 --> 02:06:21,380
I do not.

1424
02:06:21,509 --> 02:06:23,573
Qui-Gon believed in him.

1425
02:06:26,488 --> 02:06:29,142
The chosen one the boy may be.

1426
02:06:29,267 --> 02:06:30,882
Nevertheless...

1427
02:06:31,009 --> 02:06:33,864
grave danger I fear
in his training.

1428
02:06:33,996 --> 02:06:38,101
Master Yoda,
I gave Qui-Gon my word.

1429
02:06:38,227 --> 02:06:40,125
I will train Anakin.

1430
02:06:42,376 --> 02:06:44,689
Without the approval
of the council, if I must.

1431
02:06:44,824 --> 02:06:47,266
Qui-Gon's defiance
I sense in you.

1432
02:06:47,396 --> 02:06:49,294
Need that you do not.

1433
02:06:51,545 --> 02:06:54,777
Agree with you the council does.

1434
02:06:55,901 --> 02:06:59,168
Your apprentice Skywalker will be.

1435
02:07:26,849 --> 02:07:28,583
What will happen to me now?

1436
02:07:28,716 --> 02:07:31,736
The council have granted me
permission to train you.

1437
02:07:31,869 --> 02:07:35,266
You will be aJedi, I promise.

1438
02:07:44,647 --> 02:07:47,997
There's no doubt
the mysterious warrior was a Sith.

1439
02:07:48,131 --> 02:07:50,573
Always two there are.

1440
02:07:50,703 --> 02:07:53,888
No more, no less.

1441
02:07:54,022 --> 02:07:56,923
A master and an apprentice.

1442
02:07:57,050 --> 02:07:58,583
But which was destroyed?

1443
02:07:58,710 --> 02:08:01,648
The master or the apprentice?

1444
02:08:26,174 --> 02:08:28,202
Hidoe, everybody!

1445
02:09:14,587 --> 02:09:16,485
Peace!

1446
02:09:33,048 --> 02:15:29,839
