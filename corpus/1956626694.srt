00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:22,556
*

2
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:47,115
*

3
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:40,394
Your credit is based on
various factors,

4
00:02:40,428 --> 00:02:43,197
and after reviewing
your history,

5
00:02:43,231 --> 00:02:45,899
I'm sorry to say
you've been denied.

6
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:47,535
Denied?

7
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:48,902
You--you gotta
be shittin' us.

8
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:50,404
There's gotta be
some mistake.

9
00:02:50,438 --> 00:02:54,242
I have a mortgage
that I pay on time.

10
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:55,676
- Yeah.
- I understand, Mr. Vega,

11
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:57,578
but like I said,
there's other factors.

12
00:02:57,611 --> 00:02:59,313
You've opened up
another credit line,

13
00:02:59,347 --> 00:03:01,449
which you're completely
maxed out on.

14
00:03:01,482 --> 00:03:05,219
Look, Mr., uh,
Guillermo Gomez.

15
00:03:05,253 --> 00:03:06,420
My friend Bernie, this--

16
00:03:06,454 --> 00:03:08,522
this is his second liver surgery

17
00:03:08,556 --> 00:03:09,957
in--in six months.

18
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,294
We have 10 prescriptions

19
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:15,529
that we have to fill

20
00:03:15,563 --> 00:03:17,531
every two weeks.

21
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:19,967
Nobody move!

22
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:22,936
Listen up!

23
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,806
I want everybody
on the floor!

24
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:29,610
I want your palms
flat on the ground!

25
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:32,346
That means you too, old man!

26
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,947
God damn, Frank.

27
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:35,549
Man, why don't you watch
what you're doing, man?

28
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,285
I'm sorry, Bernie.
It was an accident!

29
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:39,987
Hey! What the hell
are you doing?

30
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:44,525
It cost me $190 to refill
this God damn prescription--

31
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,694
Oh, it cost you $190?

32
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:50,431
I want you to know that came out
of my disability check!

33
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:52,333
Oh, now you gonna hold that
over my head now?

34
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:54,735
I see how it works now.
It's tit for tat, huh?

35
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:56,970
No, no,
it's only tit for tat...

36
00:03:57,004 --> 00:03:59,740
when tat actually
does something for tit.

37
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:02,643
You're one ungrateful asshole.
You know that?

38
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:04,645
Screw you!

39
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:06,547
Wrong move, asshole.

40
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,018
On the ground now!

41
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,857
Deez nuts!

42
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,696
*

43
00:04:24,532 --> 00:04:25,733
Deez nuts!

44
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:29,069
*

45
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:32,340
Using only a walker
and an autographed baseball,

46
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:36,076
two elderly men managed
to stop a robbery in progress.

47
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:51,291
*

48
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:56,930
So I hope the bank
ultimately gave you a loan.

49
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:59,700
Nope. But they gave us
somethin' else.

50
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:02,736
A God damn certificate
for a job well done.

51
00:05:04,672 --> 00:05:06,540
Isn't this some shit?

52
00:05:06,574 --> 00:05:08,442
Look at me, man.

53
00:05:08,476 --> 00:05:10,711
I'm prettier
than Denzel.

54
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:11,712
Shoot.

55
00:05:18,386 --> 00:05:19,653
Who's that?

56
00:05:20,688 --> 00:05:21,955
Rosaria.

57
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:24,658
She liking Arizona?

58
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:26,727
It's Florida. Uh--

59
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,097
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
She's--she's, uh--

60
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,633
She's doing
all right.

61
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,503
Sorry, man.

62
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:36,870
No, no, it's-it's--

63
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:38,639
You know, it's wonderful, man.

64
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,641
I'm really happy for her.

65
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,877
Rosaria's got
a really good job, and...

66
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:47,114
Julia's going to
a much better school.

67
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:48,682
I'm really happy for 'em.

68
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:02,763
- Hello?
- You cheatin' on me, Frank?

69
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:04,765
'Cause I'll be damned
if you the toughest man

70
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:06,066
to get in touch with.

71
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,868
Carmen, mi amor.

72
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:09,937
- What's happening?
- Oh, nothin' much.

73
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,139
Besides the fact that
I'm getting married!

74
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:14,642
- What?
- Yes!

75
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:15,709
His name is Geoffrey.

76
00:06:15,743 --> 00:06:17,411
We met six weeks ago.

77
00:06:17,445 --> 00:06:20,113
We fit together
like molasses and pie.

78
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:22,683
I've never connected with
someone like this before, Frank.

79
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,818
Oh, that's great.
I can't wait to meet him.

80
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:26,987
Well, you're gonna get
your chance this weekend.

81
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,422
- Oh, yeah?
- Yup.

82
00:06:28,456 --> 00:06:29,657
And you and Green Machine

83
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,958
are in my wedding party.

84
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:32,025
Pack your things, boys.

85
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:33,761
You comin' down to Baton Rouge.

86
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:36,730
That's wonderful, Carmen.

87
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:40,133
And we would love
to be there, but, uh--

88
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:41,769
you know what, right now
Bernie and I are going through

89
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:43,437
some financial difficulties--

90
00:06:43,471 --> 00:06:45,038
Shut your pie hole, Franklin.

91
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:47,641
You're not gonna have to pay
for anything, cheap-ass.

92
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:50,611
Daddy's pickin' up the tab.

93
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:52,880
You know what, that's really
generous of your father, but--

94
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,583
But nothin', Vega.
I already emailed you

95
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:58,786
your flight arrangements. This
is a paid vacation for you boys.

96
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:00,187
So pack up
your damn fanny pack

97
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,055
and bring y'all asses
down here

98
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:05,058
before I fly out there
and drag you by your earlobes.

99
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:16,804
*

100
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:25,779
Oh, man.

101
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:28,816
Oh, man.

102
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:31,952
This shit don't agree with me
one bit, man.

103
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:33,921
I told you,
fish on an airplane.

104
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,255
Man, they don't mix.

105
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:38,526
Oh, shit.

106
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,530
I gotta hit
the bathroom.

107
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:53,240
Son of a bitch.

108
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:03,851
Oh, yeah.

109
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:15,596
*

110
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:17,998
Hey, little lady.

111
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:20,067
What you got for dessert?

112
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:26,239
*

113
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:35,315
*

114
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:38,919
At this point in my life,
I just don't have time

115
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:40,988
for relationships.

116
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:44,725
But I do have time
for one-nighters though.

117
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:46,994
Are you open to one-nighters,
Bernie?

118
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:50,063
One-nighters,
two-nighters--

119
00:08:50,097 --> 00:08:51,799
however long it takes.

120
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:54,034
*

121
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:55,969
Excuse me, sir,

122
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:59,573
but you're going to have
to return to your assigned seat.

123
00:08:59,607 --> 00:09:03,844
This is my assigned seat.

124
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,213
Can I see your boarding pass,
please?

125
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:11,819
Come on, man.
Give me a break.

126
00:09:16,624 --> 00:09:18,726
- It's been a pleasure.
- Bye.

127
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:25,766
You cock-blocking son of a--

128
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,200
Ladies and gentlemen,
as we start

129
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,369
our descent into Baton Rouge,

130
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,605
local time is 3:00 p.m.,
and temperature is

131
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:34,174
a cool 65 degrees.

132
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,644
* Hey

133
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:40,347
* Oh

134
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,983
*

135
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:46,286
Mmm. Nothing like the smell
of the Deep South.

136
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,989
Mmm.
Is that us?

137
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:52,125
I don't think there's another
Vega/Pope in Louisiana.

138
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,827
Gentlemen, my name is Hung.

139
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:56,096
- May I take your bags, please?
- I got this, homie.

140
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:57,965
- I--I got this.
- Sir, I insist.

141
00:09:57,998 --> 00:09:59,767
Shit, you can take mine.

142
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,672
After you, sir.

143
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:05,906
Boy, I could get used to this.

144
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,678
* Pick the best out
soon as they enter my flow *

145
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:13,113
* I'm like the US super British
say, I'm still in the show *

146
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:16,016
* Like step in my lane, trust
every step that I'm taking *

147
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:18,385
* I'm headed right to the top
until I'm famous *

148
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:20,721
* My words are drawings
you stare at in amazement *

149
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:23,090
* You pray that I fall,
I'm sorry that I made it *

150
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,726
* Know what the state of bein'
not jaded feels like? *

151
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:28,028
* Where the perception matters
more than real life *

152
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:30,097
* Your dream car takes space
in my yard *

153
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,432
* Got investments in Mars,
like to shoot for the stars *

154
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,367
- * Look
- * Oh, look at how we shine

155
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:37,004
- * This is the life
- * House on the hill

156
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:39,272
- * This is the life
- * Packin' no bills

157
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,809
- * This is the life
- * Uh-huh, uh-huh

158
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:44,077

161
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:51,852
- * This is the life *
- * Uh-huh, uh-huh

162
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:54,054
* Yeah, picture this,
takin' off the whole summer *

163
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:55,756
* When bill collectors call

164
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:57,257
* "You must have the wrong
number" *

165
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,226
* Shows overseas,
they got love for me *

166
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:01,695
* But best believe I'm touring
Belize just for me *

167
00:11:01,729 --> 00:11:04,164
* Oh, I'm getting in my grind,
it's relentless *

168
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:07,167
* Forgetting how to use the
word "buzzard" in a sentence *

169
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,436
* They all tryin' to
fit in words by guessin' *

170
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:11,471
* I'm flyin' out
to unknown settings *

171
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,306
* Oh, look at how we shine

172
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,743
- * This is the life
- * House on the hill

173
00:11:15,776 --> 00:11:18,211
- * This is the life
- * Packin' no bills

174
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:20,748
- * This is the life
- * Uh-huh, uh-huh

175
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:22,916
- * This is the life
- * Look at how we shine

176
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,252
- * This is the life
- * House on the hill

177
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,788
- * This is the life
- * Packin' no bills

178
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:30,490
- * This is the life
- * Uh-huh, uh-huh

179
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,726
* Yeah, oh,
look at how we shine *

180
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,929
- * This is the life
- * House on the hill

181
00:11:35,963 --> 00:11:37,497
Forecast is cloudy
and windy today,

182
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,033
with gusts up to
40 miles per hour,

183
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:44,071
the temperature dropping
to 59 degrees this afternoon.

184
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:46,239
Ah. Yeah.

185
00:11:47,775 --> 00:11:49,409
Oh, shit.

186
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,478
...with a high of 53.

187
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:53,446
With the winds
from the northwest...

188
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,818
- Oh, come on.
- ...it's currently 51 degrees.

189
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:59,787
With the Washington Monument
in the background,

190
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,489
the President has just arrived
off of his helicopter...

191
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:05,759
and is coming from Camp David
to spend time

192
00:12:05,793 --> 00:12:08,095
with the gathering
on the White House lawn.

193
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:09,529
This is a regular appearance...

194
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,465
Oh, Christ!

195
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:17,404
*

196
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:19,172
Hey!

197
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:22,542
*

198
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,144
Gimme the purse.

199
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:26,379
Fuck you!

200
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:29,082
Click it or ticket, asshole.

201
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:31,418
Take care of this shit.

202
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:36,289
*

203
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:39,793
Whoa, they grow them pretty big
here in Baton Rouge, huh?

204
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:43,130
*

205
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:44,965
All right now, big fella.

206
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:46,834
Son of a bitch.

207
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:47,835
Pow!

208
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,438
*

209
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:52,572
Shit.

210
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:56,576
Watch it.

211
00:12:56,609 --> 00:13:01,014
*

212
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:02,549
Whoo.

213
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:04,284
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you.

214
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:07,220
*

215
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:16,296
*

216
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:19,099
Ooh, my nose!

217
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,168
Oh, you busted my nose!

218
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:33,246
*

219
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,148
- Here you go, darling.
- Oh, thank you.

220
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:36,950
You have a nice day.

221
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:43,323
*

222
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:44,457
Wow.

223
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,026
Carmen's parents live here?

224
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:48,028
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.

225
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:50,030
Reminds me of
my vacation home.

226
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:53,433
*

227
00:13:55,202 --> 00:13:56,569
Oh!

228
00:13:56,603 --> 00:13:57,905
Oh, oh!

229
00:13:57,938 --> 00:13:59,572
All right, finally!

230
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:02,275
Now we can get
this party started! Oh!

231
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:03,944
*

232
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:05,045
- Oh.
- Oh!

233
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:06,379
Oh!

234
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:08,648
Damn, you look good, girl.

235
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:11,218
Now, you boys had your chance.

236
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:12,652
I'm a taken woman now, okay?

237
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:15,322
Come on in.
I wanna introduce you

238
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,124
to my mama and daddy, all right?

239
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:19,326
Damn, baby, if I knew
you had this much money,

240
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,528
I would've proposed to you
six months ago.

241
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:26,066
Mama, Daddy, I want you
to meet Frank and Bernie.

242
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:27,100
- Oh.
- Oh.

243
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:28,368
Well, welcome,
gentlemen.

244
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:29,903
Thank you.
Pleasure to meet you.

245
00:14:29,937 --> 00:14:31,071
And thank you for
bringing us out here.

246
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:32,405
Yeah, very generous of you.

247
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:34,641
- Ah, it's our pleasure.
- Ooh, Carmen.

248
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:37,277
You didn't tell me
how handsome they were.

249
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,946
Hey, girl, take it easy.

250
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:40,280
Hey, guys.

251
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:41,949
Oh, my goodness!

252
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:43,483
Baby, what happened?

253
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:47,054
Oh, it was just
Kyle and his buddies.

254
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:49,122
Earl, do you see this?

255
00:14:49,156 --> 00:14:50,590
Baby, just a little
innocent roughhousing.

256
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,326
Boys'll be boys.
He'll be just fine.

257
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,462
Son, let me introduce you
to your sister's friends

258
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:57,397
from California,
Bernie and Frank.

259
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,299
- What's up, guys?
- Sister?

260
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:01,501
Yeah. He's my brother
from another mother.

261
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:03,236
Mama had that little
in vitro thing.

262
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,939
We think the egg and the sperm
got a little mixed up.

263
00:15:05,973 --> 00:15:07,507
Felt all the same to me.

264
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,277
Either way,
we love us some little Ronny.

265
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:14,247
Well, gentlemen, welcome. Now
let me show you to your room.

266
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:16,483
My, oh, my, Earl.

267
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:19,052
This house must have
cost you a pretty penny.

268
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:20,520
Didn't cost me a dime.

269
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:21,521
Say what?

270
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:23,090
It's a family estate

271
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:25,993
passed down from generation
to generation.

272
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:28,228
It was given to
my great-great-granddaddy

273
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,729
post-Civil War...

274
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:34,267
as part of the agrarian reform
for black farmers.

275
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:36,970
Little did anybody know that
this house was sitting on

276
00:15:37,004 --> 00:15:38,972
mineral reserves,
including oil,

277
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:42,075
which turned our family into
millionaires overnight.

278
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:44,511
Damn. Karma's a bitch,
Robert E. Lee.

279
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:47,981
Ain't it the truth?

280
00:15:48,015 --> 00:15:50,017
Hope you guys don't mind
sleepin' in the same room.

281
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,251
We got a lot of guests
stayin' over,

282
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,519
so the house is kinda full.

283
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:54,054
- Hey.
- Huh?

284
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:56,089
I didn't know
you were in the military.

285
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:57,757
Oh, yeah.

286
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:02,762
Spent some time in Nam
many, many years ago.

287
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:06,699
I don't even know
who that guy is anymore.

288
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:09,202
There we go.
Everything ought to be here,

289
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:12,039
but, fellas, if there's anything
else at all that you need,

290
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:14,041
please don't
hesitate to ask.

291
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:15,542
What time you sending up
the ladies?

292
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:20,213
After midnight.

293
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:21,381
Why so late?

294
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:28,621
Uh, fellas,
I just wanna say thank you

295
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:31,791
for watchin' over my little girl
while she was in LA.

296
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,360
It means a lot.

297
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:35,462
Carmen's a special girl.

298
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:36,496
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

299
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:39,632
Oh, now.

300
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,468
Oh, rehearsal dinner's
in less than an hour.

301
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,236
You guys got to get dressed.

302
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,172
Now I took the liberty
of hangin' up a couple suits

303
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:46,373
for you in the armoire.

304
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:48,708
I think we got
your right sizes.

305
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,177
One minute.

306
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,414
* I just do what I do

307
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:56,683
* See me, I just do what I do

308
00:16:56,716 --> 00:16:58,718
* Man, I just do what I do

309
00:16:58,751 --> 00:16:59,786
Do you know about me?

310
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:02,755
* I just do what I do

311
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:04,524
Let's do this.

312
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:05,725
See that?

313
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:08,628
* Yeah, I just do what I do

314
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:10,597
* See me,
I just do what I do *

315
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:13,100
* Yo, check,
let me flip this script *

316
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:16,503
* I feel privileged by all
who can witness this *

317
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,706
Damn. They invited the entire
state of Louisiana.

318
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:23,343
Maybe they're just popular
or something. Whoo!

319
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,145
Gentlemen, can I tempt
your palate

320
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:28,148
to some of Louisiana's
finest mint juleps?

321
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:30,283
Don't mind if I do.

322
00:17:30,317 --> 00:17:33,253
Wow, I've never seen a drink
with a plant growing out of it.

323
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:34,787
Well, that's not a plant, sir.

324
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:36,489
Those are mint sprigs.

325
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:38,691
Very refreshing.

326
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:40,593
Enjoy.

327
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:41,828
Mmm.

328
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:43,196
Mint sprigs.

329
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,564
Here's to.

330
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:49,702
Straight outta the pages of GQ.

331
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:52,772
Damn! You boys look like
fine Southern gentlemen.

332
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:53,773
Hey, baby.

333
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,376
There you go.

334
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,777
Girl, I can't leave you
for two minutes

335
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,212
without someone hitting on you.

336
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:00,413
Oh, baby, I want you

337
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:01,848
to meet Frank and Bernie.

338
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:04,151
Boys, this is my Geoffrey.

339
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:06,886
Gentlemen, it's an honor
to finally meet you.

340
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,288
You must be Frank.

341
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:09,589
Pleasure.

342
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:11,658
And you must be Green Machine.

343
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:13,326
Yeah. Nice to meet you.

344
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,295
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

345
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:17,130
You're getting yourself
a wonderful woman.

346
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:19,732
Oh, I know.
I'm blessed.

347
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:22,669
Must've done something good
in a past life to deserve her.

348
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:23,770
Isn't he cute?

349
00:18:25,872 --> 00:18:28,841
Geoffrey!

350
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,910
- Looks like I'm being summoned.
- Mm-hm.

351
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:34,514
Excuse me, gentlemen.

352
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:35,615
Sweetheart.

353
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:38,818
*

354
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:39,919
Nice guy.

355
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,421
No one has ever made me feel

356
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:42,489
the way he does,

357
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:44,357
and I've never been happier.

358
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:46,626
What happened to him?

359
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:48,928
If you don't mind me asking.

360
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,631
He was in Afghanistan
on the front lines.

361
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:53,833
He took an IED for a buddy.

362
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,402
I'm sorry, Carmen.

363
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:57,404
Nothing to be sorry about.

364
00:18:57,437 --> 00:19:00,673
That man lives his life like
he's standin' seven feet tall.

365
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,311
*

366
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:13,620
*

367
00:19:15,522 --> 00:19:16,756
I wanna thank you all
for comin',

368
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:20,193
and now I'd like
to say a few words.

369
00:19:20,227 --> 00:19:22,929
You know,
it's tough for a father

370
00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:24,931
to watch his daughter
grow and...

371
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:27,867
then to give her away
to a stranger.

372
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,237
Wait a minute.

373
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,239
That's the speech from
her first wedding.

374
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,311
Here it is.

375
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:40,580
It's tough for a father

376
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:42,815
to watch his daughter grow,

377
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:45,418
give her away
to some stranger,

378
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:47,487
get her back and then
give her away again.

379
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:54,394
But it makes it easier when
you have a future son-in-law

380
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:56,629
like Geoffrey here. Mmm?

381
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:02,802
Your mother and I wish you both
the very best.

382
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:05,972
Hear! Hear!

383
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:12,345
*

384
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:18,751
Okay, okay. A toast.

385
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:20,287
- A toast right now.
- Yeah.

386
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,654
Carmen and Geoffrey,

387
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:23,456
we wanna wish you all the best

388
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:24,857
in the world forever.

389
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:29,262
May you always have
happiness, love...

390
00:20:29,296 --> 00:20:30,897
and you know what else--
you know that.

391
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:34,767
*

392
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:36,403
Yeah.

393
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:40,773
*

394
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:49,549
*

395
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,832
Mmm. Mmm.

396
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:08,835
Ahhh.

397
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:10,503
Ah, yeah.

398
00:21:10,537 --> 00:21:15,575
*

399
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:28,955
*

400
00:21:34,694 --> 00:21:40,833
*

401
00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:05,057
*

402
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:12,965
*

403
00:22:15,602 --> 00:22:20,373
*

404
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,109
Let her go!

405
00:22:23,142 --> 00:22:24,744
Shut up, buddy!

406
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:26,713
Bernie!

407
00:22:28,615 --> 00:22:29,682
Bernie!

408
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,922
*

409
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:38,057
Bernie, for Christ's sakes,
help me!

410
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,426
*

411
00:22:44,764 --> 00:22:45,898
Hey, Frank!

412
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,403
Frank!

413
00:22:50,437 --> 00:22:51,838
God damn, man!

414
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:54,040
How could you be sleeping
at a time like this?

415
00:22:54,073 --> 00:22:56,543
Huh? Ow!

416
00:22:58,177 --> 00:22:59,912
Where's Carmen?

417
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:02,549
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

418
00:23:02,582 --> 00:23:04,150
Somebody took her.

419
00:23:06,953 --> 00:23:08,455
I don't know.

420
00:23:08,488 --> 00:23:09,689
Like I said,
we were sleeping

421
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,558
and they just barged in
and took her.

422
00:23:11,591 --> 00:23:13,192
That's all I remember.

423
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,627
Jesus Christ,
shouldn't you all be out

424
00:23:14,661 --> 00:23:15,762
looking for these bastards?

425
00:23:15,795 --> 00:23:16,929
Okay, look, just calm down.

426
00:23:16,963 --> 00:23:17,930
You need to understand this is

427
00:23:17,964 --> 00:23:19,031
all part of the process.

428
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:20,199
I don't think you understand.

429
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:23,035
My fiancée's been kidnapped!

430
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:24,571
Damn it, we told you.

431
00:23:24,604 --> 00:23:25,738
We never heard a thing

432
00:23:25,772 --> 00:23:27,540
until Frank started yellin'.

433
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:29,776
By the time we got out there,
they were gone.

434
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:30,877
I want my child.

435
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,779
I know, baby.

436
00:23:32,812 --> 00:23:34,681
Can you give us
any type of description?

437
00:23:35,982 --> 00:23:37,016
Well, I couldn't make out much

438
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:39,085
in the dark, but, uh...

439
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:42,655
they had ski masks and, uh,
there was a lot of 'em.

440
00:23:42,689 --> 00:23:44,190
How many would you say?

441
00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:46,926
Eight, ten, maybe more.

442
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:49,061
Come on, man,
how could you not know?

443
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:51,130
Oh, maybe because
it was pitch black,

444
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:52,665
and they all kept comin' at me,

445
00:23:52,699 --> 00:23:54,233
and I didn't have any help,
Bernie!

446
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,536
So now you gonna blame me
for it, huh?

447
00:23:56,569 --> 00:23:58,905
Okay, gentlemen.

448
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,473
Let's not bicker.

449
00:24:00,507 --> 00:24:02,575
It's not gonna help us
get her back.

450
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:03,910
You are gonna find her?

451
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:06,879
I mean,
it's a pretty small town.

452
00:24:06,913 --> 00:24:12,719
239,139 to be exact,
Mr. Vega.

453
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:15,688
Just a tad bit bigger
than Mayberry.

454
00:24:15,722 --> 00:24:18,691
Okay, Chief, I think
we got everything here.

455
00:24:18,725 --> 00:24:22,995
Follow up with, uh, Wigram on
them there surveillance cameras.

456
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:24,163
I'm on it.

457
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:28,000
Chief Broussard,

458
00:24:28,034 --> 00:24:30,036
I don't want the next time
I see my daughter

459
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:31,804
to be on the side
of a milk carton.

460
00:24:31,838 --> 00:24:33,005
You hear me?

461
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,173
Now, I don't care what it takes

462
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:35,842
or how much money
I got to spend.

463
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:37,176
You got to get her back,

464
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:39,178
and you got to get
my daughter back now.

465
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:41,748
*

466
00:24:41,781 --> 00:24:43,049
Telephone call for you,
Mr. Morgan.

467
00:24:43,082 --> 00:24:44,684
Hung, now is not the time.

468
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:46,285
He says he has Carmen.

469
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,587
Is he on hold?

470
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,655
Yes.

471
00:24:48,688 --> 00:24:49,689
We got this thing tracked.

472
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:51,724
Take the call.

473
00:24:51,758 --> 00:24:53,593
*

474
00:24:53,626 --> 00:24:55,227
- Hello.
- Let's cut to the chase,

475
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:56,729
Mr. Morgan.

476
00:24:56,763 --> 00:24:58,698
Five million
for your daughter.

477
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:00,867
You'll have 32 hours,
upon which I'll contact you

478
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,636
to reveal a designated
meeting location.

479
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:07,039
You mess up any of my
instructions and she's dead.

480
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:12,078
*

481
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:13,946
I don't know.
It could be anyone.

482
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,584
You know, a black man with money
is not a recipe for popularity.

483
00:25:17,617 --> 00:25:20,252
You know, whoever did this
really planned it out.

484
00:25:20,286 --> 00:25:22,054
This was organized.

485
00:25:22,088 --> 00:25:23,590
Anyone have it out for you

486
00:25:23,623 --> 00:25:25,257
or been following you around
lately?

487
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:26,993
Of course.
I get people all the time

488
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:30,029
trying to get me to invest in
businesses or sell this house.

489
00:25:31,931 --> 00:25:33,866
Man, I can't believe
this is happenin'.

490
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,568
This is my baby girl.
She's supposed to be

491
00:25:35,602 --> 00:25:36,769
gettin' married on Sunday.

492
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:46,278
Mmm.

493
00:25:46,312 --> 00:25:50,082
Oh. We need your help.
This is a small town.

494
00:25:50,116 --> 00:25:52,885
We don't get too many of these
types of crimes around here.

495
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:56,355
But I know you boys have
experience with this back in LA.

496
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,258
- Uh, not exactly--
- We need your help.

497
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:03,329
We need you to find Carmen
and bring her back home.

498
00:26:03,362 --> 00:26:06,599
Mrs. Morgan, you have the-the--
The police are on this--

499
00:26:06,633 --> 00:26:08,935
The police aren't going
to do anything.

500
00:26:08,968 --> 00:26:10,369
They got their heads
so far up their asses

501
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:13,205
they can't see squat.

502
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:14,641
We need you two...

503
00:26:14,674 --> 00:26:15,875
if there's any hope in me

504
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:19,245
gettin' my Carmen back.

505
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:21,147
Guys!

506
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:24,216
Guys, look what I found
by the side gate.

507
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,819
*

508
00:26:26,853 --> 00:26:28,220
Buford?

509
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:32,058
- Who names their kid Buford?
- Let me see.

510
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:35,628
Ronald found this on
the north side of the estate.

511
00:26:35,662 --> 00:26:38,931
Now, how'd my people
overlook this?

512
00:26:38,965 --> 00:26:41,868
Sloppiness really gives me
the mal au ventres.

513
00:26:41,901 --> 00:26:44,403
We'll check into it.
Might be one of my boys.

514
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,938
Thank you, gentlemen.

515
00:26:45,972 --> 00:26:48,841
Whoa--

516
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:52,378
You must have some idea
who's behind this.

517
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:55,114
Let me tell you something.

518
00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:57,016
This ain't Los Angeles.

519
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:59,085
This here is Baton Rouge.

520
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:01,754
We don't go in for that
canaille vigilante crap

521
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:03,856
y'all be pullin' down there.

522
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:08,027
And if you even think about
gettin' involved in this case--

523
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:11,397
I hear you put even
one nose hair in this case--

524
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:15,802
I'm gonna lock y'all up for the
rest of y'all golden years.

525
00:27:15,835 --> 00:27:18,337
You gentlemen enjoy
the rest of y'all afternoon.

526
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:26,112
Let's go get
those son of a bitches.

527
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,280
- * When you hear that
- * Bang-bang-bang

528
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:30,883
- * Duck and run for cover
- * Bang-bang-bang

529
00:27:30,917 --> 00:27:33,252
- * When you hear that
- * Bang-bang-bang

530
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:35,922
- * Duck and run for cover
- * Bang-bang-bang

531
00:27:35,955 --> 00:27:38,357
- * When you hear that
- * Bang-bang-bang

532
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:41,027
- * Duck and run for cover
- * Bang-bang-bang

533
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,462
* When you hear that,
when you hear that *

534
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,065
* When you hear that,
when you hear that *

535
00:27:46,098 --> 00:27:49,468
* When you hear that, flush 'em
out quick just like Drano *

536
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:52,038
* Keep doing your thing,
it's the same old, same old *

537
00:27:52,071 --> 00:27:54,974
* Might blow the top off,
call it volcano *

538
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:57,309
* We in the bayous,
no Sandro Pedro *

539
00:27:57,343 --> 00:27:59,946
* Shooting up these suckers
like they're duck hunters *

540
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:02,348
* No Toyotas
but they forerunners *

541
00:28:02,381 --> 00:28:04,851
* Beat 'em, rabid fool,
now they all doublers *

542
00:28:04,884 --> 00:28:07,787
* When it goes off, isn't that
how it started-da-da-da-da? *

543
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:10,122
* A daily combo
running like the capo too *

544
00:28:10,156 --> 00:28:12,959
* Bam-bam-bam,
fire like charcoal *

545
00:28:12,992 --> 00:28:14,961
* We soldiers
shoulder to shoulder *

546
00:28:14,994 --> 00:28:16,963
* Pura balacera
till it's over *

547
00:28:16,996 --> 00:28:19,298
- * When you hear that
- * Bang-bang-bang

548
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:21,868
- * Duck and run for cover
- * Bang-bang-bang

549
00:28:21,901 --> 00:28:24,303
- * When you hear that
- * Bang-bang-bang

550
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:26,973
- * Duck and run for cover
- * Bang-bang-bang

551
00:28:27,006 --> 00:28:29,375
- * When you hear that
- * Bang-bang-bang

552
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:31,077
* Duck and run for cover

553
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:34,180
I'm just gonna make this clear
right now.

554
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:36,916
- No running.
- What?

555
00:28:36,949 --> 00:28:39,385
Now, I will do all
the ass-kicking you want,

556
00:28:39,418 --> 00:28:43,255
but I'm not
chasin' after shit.

557
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:45,424
Such a bitch.

558
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,842
We're not in LA anymore.

559
00:29:05,044 --> 00:29:07,113
* Yeah, yeah

560
00:29:07,146 --> 00:29:09,481
* Uh-huh

561
00:29:09,515 --> 00:29:11,483
* Whoo, whoo

562
00:29:11,517 --> 00:29:13,820
* That's what I'm talkin' about
right there *

563
00:29:13,853 --> 00:29:16,555
- * This is how we roll
- * This is how we roll

564
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,791
* Take you
where you wanna go *

565
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:21,861
Whoo!

566
00:29:21,894 --> 00:29:25,798
God damn kidney stone's
kickin' my ass again.

567
00:29:25,832 --> 00:29:27,800
You're fallin' apart
piece by piece, chief.

568
00:29:27,834 --> 00:29:29,836
Hey, good news,
I still got my penis.

569
00:29:31,037 --> 00:29:33,339
Hello there,
little lady.

570
00:29:36,308 --> 00:29:38,277
- Come on. Let's go in.
- Yeah.

571
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,412
* Three miles back
in the swampy woods *

572
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:43,282
* I can still see his face

573
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:45,517
* Blood-stained clothes,
covered in mud *

574
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:48,487
* Gotta get out of this place

575
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,023
* Runnin' through the back
of the field

576
00:29:51,057 --> 00:29:53,559
along the property line *

577
00:29:53,592 --> 00:29:56,062
* Hiding in the reeds
by the church

578
00:29:56,095 --> 00:29:58,430
just trying to calm my mind *

579
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:03,235
* in the swamp
down in Crystal Springs *

580
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:06,205
Last time I saw this many
white people in one place,

581
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:10,209
they set fire to a cross
on my dichondra.

582
00:30:10,242 --> 00:30:13,946
Bernie, it's good for you
to get out of your comfort zone,

583
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,081
meet some people.

584
00:30:15,114 --> 00:30:17,149
Ah, not these type
of people.

585
00:30:17,183 --> 00:30:18,851
* Not really sure why

586
00:30:18,885 --> 00:30:20,152
But then, Mama always said,

587
00:30:20,186 --> 00:30:21,553
"Don't be so closed-minded."

588
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:32,464
Uh, hello,
ladies and gentlemen!

589
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:35,001
We just wanna
ask you...

590
00:30:35,034 --> 00:30:37,904
one question.

591
00:30:37,937 --> 00:30:40,206
Go ahead, Frank.

592
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:43,109
Oh, uh--yeah, we're looking
for a Mr. Buford.

593
00:30:43,142 --> 00:30:45,044
Does anybody here
know his whereabouts?

594
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:48,214
I do.

595
00:30:48,247 --> 00:30:49,882
Hey--

596
00:30:49,916 --> 00:30:51,884
Hey, fellas. How ya doin'?

597
00:30:51,918 --> 00:30:53,619
Looks like you're healing up
real nicely.

598
00:30:53,652 --> 00:30:55,287
Hell yeah.
Much better than y'all did

599
00:30:55,321 --> 00:30:56,655
before we fucked y'all up.

600
00:31:02,061 --> 00:31:03,129
Ow!

601
00:31:03,162 --> 00:31:06,532
*

602
00:31:06,565 --> 00:31:08,267
Take a seat!

603
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,337
*

604
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,604
Die, asshole!

605
00:31:12,638 --> 00:31:13,906
*

606
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,075
Ow! Ow!

607
00:31:20,412 --> 00:31:22,915
Now...

608
00:31:22,949 --> 00:31:26,285
you Q-tip-looking
motherfuckers!

609
00:31:26,318 --> 00:31:29,255
I'm gon' ask you one more time!

610
00:31:29,288 --> 00:31:31,557
Where's Buford?

611
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,298
I said no running.

612
00:31:43,302 --> 00:31:45,404
Hey. Hey.

613
00:31:45,437 --> 00:31:47,273
Mr. Buford.

614
00:31:47,306 --> 00:31:49,208
Pleasure to make
your acquaintance.

615
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:51,277
How'd you get in here
without your VIP card?

616
00:31:52,678 --> 00:31:53,980
Now, where's Carmen?

617
00:31:54,013 --> 00:31:55,214
Fuck off!

618
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:57,583
Oh. Oh, okay. Fuck off.

619
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:02,154
Ah-ah-ah-ah!

620
00:32:02,188 --> 00:32:03,189
Get the hell back.

621
00:32:05,624 --> 00:32:08,995
*

622
00:32:09,028 --> 00:32:11,563
I don't know, man!
I swear to God!

623
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:14,366
I ain't got access
to the inner circle, man.

624
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,268
Landry does. Landry knows!

625
00:32:16,302 --> 00:32:18,037
Where can I find
this Mr. Landry?

626
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,438
Downtown, man.

627
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:21,473
Up the road.
It's on Seventh and Convention.

628
00:32:21,507 --> 00:32:23,175
It's a big white loft,
top floor.

629
00:32:23,209 --> 00:32:24,543
You can't fuckin' miss it.

630
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,545
I really wanna thank you
for your cooperation.

631
00:32:26,578 --> 00:32:27,746
I mean it.

632
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:37,123
*

633
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:47,133
*

634
00:32:53,405 --> 00:32:56,342
Ronny.
What's up, buddy?

635
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:59,411
Hey. I was just actually
runnin' late--

636
00:32:59,445 --> 00:33:02,114
No, hey, I understand.

637
00:33:02,148 --> 00:33:04,316
You're a busy man.
Got places to go.

638
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:08,020
He's got deals to make.
I get it.

639
00:33:08,054 --> 00:33:09,355
Listen, I was gonna ask you
a favor as a friend.

640
00:33:09,388 --> 00:33:10,622
My car's in the shop,
so I'm gonna

641
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,224
borrow yours for
a couple weeks.

642
00:33:12,258 --> 00:33:14,093
Cool with that?

643
00:33:14,126 --> 00:33:16,562
My car?

644
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:19,798
This week,
we have family in--in town,

645
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:23,702
and--and I'm playing chauffeur.

646
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:27,339
Oh, yeah. No, hey.
I totally get it.

647
00:33:27,373 --> 00:33:30,309
I get that.

648
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:33,812
Listen, either
you give me this car,

649
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,781
or I'll beat
the shit out of you.

650
00:33:35,814 --> 00:33:38,384
It's your choice.

651
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:40,486
Hey.

652
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,221
You boys got somewhere
you gotta be?

653
00:33:42,254 --> 00:33:43,455
Yeah.

654
00:33:43,489 --> 00:33:45,591
We're all set.

655
00:33:45,624 --> 00:33:46,692
Keep it moving.

656
00:33:49,328 --> 00:33:55,467
*

657
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:06,044
*

658
00:34:38,477 --> 00:34:42,181
Unless you gonna let my ass go,
I don't want shit from you.

659
00:34:42,214 --> 00:34:44,683
Is that any way
to treat your host?

660
00:34:44,716 --> 00:34:48,320
I done got you them nice white
shoes to keep your feet warm.

661
00:34:48,354 --> 00:34:50,556
Look, you Duck Dynasty-
looking motherfucker,

662
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:52,224
if you think for one minute
you gonna get away

663
00:34:52,258 --> 00:34:55,261
with this shit, you dead wrong.

664
00:34:55,294 --> 00:34:58,364
All right then.

665
00:34:58,397 --> 00:35:00,199
I'll keep it warm for you.

666
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:20,486
*

667
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:21,920
Those God damn old bastards.

668
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,856
They just came in
and roughed up Buford.

669
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:28,227
Pete. You mind taking that
someplace else?

670
00:35:29,928 --> 00:35:31,263
Yeah, sure.

671
00:35:41,207 --> 00:35:42,708
What the fuck?

672
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:44,410
How in the hell Buford

673
00:35:44,443 --> 00:35:46,645
let two old sons of bitches
rough him up?

674
00:35:46,678 --> 00:35:48,280
I don't know.
He's a God damn mama's boy.

675
00:35:48,314 --> 00:35:51,283
I told y'all to follow them.

676
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:59,858
*

677
00:36:16,575 --> 00:36:19,711
*

678
00:36:19,745 --> 00:36:24,683
Man, why do all bad guys
got nice places?

679
00:36:24,716 --> 00:36:26,918
Same reason they all got
beautiful women.

680
00:36:26,952 --> 00:36:28,454
Boy, what you talking about?

681
00:36:28,487 --> 00:36:30,422
They don't all have
beautiful women.

682
00:36:36,262 --> 00:36:37,329
Hey, little lady.

683
00:36:37,363 --> 00:36:38,564
We're here to see Landry.

684
00:36:38,597 --> 00:36:40,232
Is he around?

685
00:36:40,266 --> 00:36:41,633
Landry doesn't
live here anymore,

686
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:44,270
so get lost.

687
00:36:44,303 --> 00:36:47,306
Can you tell us
where we might find him?

688
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:49,741
Get your foot out of my door.

689
00:36:49,775 --> 00:36:51,277
Come on, little girl.

690
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:53,312
No sense in you acting all--

691
00:36:57,283 --> 00:36:58,684
*

692
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,552
I think she loosened a crown.

693
00:37:00,586 --> 00:37:02,688
Wait. Now hold it.
There's no need for violence.

694
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:04,556
We just wanna talk.

695
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,325
Now--now--now--
now, look here, lady.

696
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:08,627
We're gentlemen.
We don't hit women--

697
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,728
Ow!

698
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:14,666
*

699
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:18,637
Now, all we wanna know
is where Landry is.

700
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,639
Fuck you!

701
00:37:20,672 --> 00:37:22,341
- All right.
- Let go of me!

702
00:37:22,374 --> 00:37:23,709
I can't breathe!

703
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:25,877
Not till you tell me
where Landry is.

704
00:37:27,813 --> 00:37:28,814
Buckhead--

705
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:32,751
*

706
00:37:32,784 --> 00:37:36,422
- Where is he?
- He works at Buckheads. It's--

707
00:37:36,455 --> 00:37:40,592
It's a barbecue place
just outside of town.

708
00:37:40,626 --> 00:37:41,827
He'll be there tomorrow morning.

709
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,595
Now get the fuck outta here!

710
00:37:43,629 --> 00:37:44,863
So soon?

711
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:46,765
I thought we had
a beautiful connection.

712
00:37:46,798 --> 00:37:48,834
Aside from your foot
in my kidney.

713
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:51,537
God damn. You see
any internal bleeding?

714
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:52,638
Damn.

715
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:05,917
*

716
00:38:16,762 --> 00:38:18,464
What's up, buddy?

717
00:38:18,497 --> 00:38:20,599
So happy I ran into you
here, man.

718
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:23,869
- Listen, Kyle, I--
- Shh. Shh, shh, shh.

719
00:38:23,902 --> 00:38:25,971
Shh, shh, shh.

720
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:31,743
Listen, I'm gonna need, like,
20 bucks or so for some snacks.

721
00:38:31,777 --> 00:38:34,813
I, uh--I don't have that.

722
00:38:34,846 --> 00:38:36,582
Oh, I think you do,
money ball.

723
00:38:36,615 --> 00:38:37,983
No, not really.

724
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:39,718
I would--I would.

725
00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:41,653
Hand it over...

726
00:38:41,687 --> 00:38:43,088
before I beat you senseless.

727
00:38:45,724 --> 00:38:46,792
*

728
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:49,094
Yeah. All right.

729
00:38:49,127 --> 00:38:54,065
*

730
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:55,701
Why don't you get a job?

731
00:38:55,734 --> 00:38:57,135
Who the hell are you?

732
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,870
Friends of Ronald.

733
00:38:58,904 --> 00:39:02,140
If I'm not mistaken,
they're hiring here.

734
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,675
You've gotta be kidding me,
right?

735
00:39:03,709 --> 00:39:06,445
You got your grandpa
in here to protect you?

736
00:39:06,478 --> 00:39:08,580
Don't you two got some early
bird buffet to hit up?

737
00:39:08,614 --> 00:39:10,148
- Kyle.
- Yeah, if I were you two,

738
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,751
I'd back the hell up
right now before I--

739
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:14,986
- Kyle!
- What?

740
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,423
It's the Bad Asses.

741
00:39:17,456 --> 00:39:18,990
What?

742
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:21,560
Bad Asses.
From the bank.

743
00:39:21,593 --> 00:39:23,995
Oh, snap, it is.

744
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:26,598
Wow! Whoa, we are huge fans.

745
00:39:26,632 --> 00:39:28,033
- Kyle.
- Dad.

746
00:39:28,066 --> 00:39:29,601
- What's goin' on here?
- Hey, nothin'.

747
00:39:29,635 --> 00:39:30,702
Just havin' a conversation
with Ronny

748
00:39:30,736 --> 00:39:31,870
and the Bad Asses.

749
00:39:31,903 --> 00:39:33,672
You know who these guys are,
right?

750
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:36,408
Yeah, we've met.
Gentlemen.

751
00:39:36,442 --> 00:39:38,143
Mom wants us home
for dinner before 6:00,

752
00:39:38,176 --> 00:39:39,645
so we gotta get a move on.

753
00:39:39,678 --> 00:39:41,046
Okay.

754
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:42,481
We're all cool.

755
00:39:45,451 --> 00:39:47,085
Good evening.

756
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:55,093
*

757
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:57,963
I appreciate what y'all did,

758
00:39:57,996 --> 00:40:01,667
but I can't have you interfering
in my son's business.

759
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:05,604
I'm trying to steer him away
from violence and threats,

760
00:40:05,637 --> 00:40:07,539
and instead use diplomacy

761
00:40:07,573 --> 00:40:10,942
as a tool to confront conflict,
hmm?

762
00:40:10,976 --> 00:40:13,144
How's that diplomacy
workin' out for you?

763
00:40:13,178 --> 00:40:14,680
Just fine.

764
00:40:14,713 --> 00:40:16,482
No offense, gentlemen,

765
00:40:16,515 --> 00:40:19,951
but I am not a fan
of your tactics.

766
00:40:19,985 --> 00:40:22,488
I think there's better ways
to solve problems.

767
00:40:22,521 --> 00:40:24,055
Explain to me, Earl.

768
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:27,125
How do you go from
bein' in the Marines

769
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:28,894
to bein' a pacifist?

770
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:31,863
After you've seen
what I've seen,

771
00:40:31,897 --> 00:40:35,534
you never wanna be involved
with violence again.

772
00:40:37,736 --> 00:40:40,238
- Geoffrey.
- Hey. How you doing?

773
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,007
Hey, son.

774
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,209
I can't believe
this is even happening.

775
00:40:44,242 --> 00:40:46,645
Now, we got it covered, Geoff.

776
00:40:46,678 --> 00:40:49,948
I can't stop thinking about what
they're doing to her right now.

777
00:40:49,981 --> 00:40:52,083
Calm down, son. Take it easy.

778
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:54,686
Why don't you try
to get some sleep?

779
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,088
You think I can sleep
at a time like this?

780
00:41:12,571 --> 00:41:14,239
Hey, what was that?

781
00:41:19,645 --> 00:41:23,615
*

782
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:26,017
Hey, you'll have to excuse me.

783
00:41:26,051 --> 00:41:27,252
I think I just knocked over

784
00:41:27,285 --> 00:41:28,554
one of Mr. Morgan's planters

785
00:41:28,587 --> 00:41:31,089
on the way in.

786
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:34,159
For some reason,
he's got it out for you two.

787
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:37,629
You boys need to just
stay away from this case.

788
00:41:37,663 --> 00:41:39,598
I have a problem stayin' away
from somethin'

789
00:41:39,631 --> 00:41:43,001
I know nobody's
doin' anything about.

790
00:41:43,034 --> 00:41:46,104
Who said nobody's doin' anything
about this case? Huh?

791
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:48,874
I can assure you we are doin'
everything we can,

792
00:41:48,907 --> 00:41:50,108
and we'll get Carmen back.

793
00:41:50,141 --> 00:41:52,310
That's bullshit, man.

794
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,879
Excuse me?

795
00:41:53,912 --> 00:41:56,014
People above you
are makin' a mockery

796
00:41:56,047 --> 00:41:59,050
of your justice system.

797
00:41:59,084 --> 00:42:00,986
Look, Mr. Vega,

798
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:03,822
I am all for
what you two are about.

799
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:06,858
But my advice is just
to leave this alone...

800
00:42:06,892 --> 00:42:09,127
and let us do our job, okay?

801
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:14,199
*

802
00:42:20,171 --> 00:42:23,675
*

803
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:26,945
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

804
00:42:26,978 --> 00:42:29,981
Sure. Come on in.

805
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:31,182
Sit down.

806
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:32,918
*

807
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:38,624
I just wanted to thank you
for helping me out.

808
00:42:38,657 --> 00:42:40,058
It was nothin'.

809
00:42:40,091 --> 00:42:42,594
They just needed
a little straightening out.

810
00:42:42,628 --> 00:42:47,032
*

811
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:49,868
I want you to have this.

812
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:52,070
This was my father's.

813
00:42:52,103 --> 00:42:55,841
He carried it around with him
during the war.

814
00:42:55,874 --> 00:42:56,842
It's pure titanium.

815
00:42:56,875 --> 00:43:00,145
This saved his life.

816
00:43:00,178 --> 00:43:02,948
Look, you can even see
the bullet mark.

817
00:43:02,981 --> 00:43:05,684
*

818
00:43:05,717 --> 00:43:08,620
Ronald, it's beautiful,
but I can't keep this.

819
00:43:08,654 --> 00:43:10,789
Please.

820
00:43:10,822 --> 00:43:12,858
I want you to have it.

821
00:43:12,891 --> 00:43:15,794
*

822
00:43:15,827 --> 00:43:18,797
Thank you.

823
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:20,932
Can I...

824
00:43:20,966 --> 00:43:23,134
ask you a question, Frank?

825
00:43:23,168 --> 00:43:25,871
Yeah.

826
00:43:25,904 --> 00:43:29,107
Did you always have it
in you to...

827
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:31,910
be a hero?

828
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:34,012
I don't know.

829
00:43:34,045 --> 00:43:35,747
I'm just...

830
00:43:35,781 --> 00:43:40,151
wondering if it's something
you just have...

831
00:43:40,185 --> 00:43:43,021
or you don't.

832
00:43:43,054 --> 00:43:46,157
You've got it in you.

833
00:43:46,191 --> 00:43:49,127
You just gotta be true
to yourself...

834
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,362
and--and keep
doing the right thing.

835
00:43:51,396 --> 00:43:52,831
*

836
00:43:52,864 --> 00:43:54,365
All right, now. Cut out

837
00:43:54,399 --> 00:43:56,434
that Little House
on the Prairie shit

838
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,169
and get the hell to sleep.

839
00:43:58,203 --> 00:43:59,337
Shit.

840
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:08,113
*

841
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:53,324
*

842
00:44:57,095 --> 00:45:03,234
*

843
00:45:16,848 --> 00:45:19,184
I can't tell you how many times
she accidentally rubbed

844
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:21,119
her elbow against my nuts.

845
00:45:21,152 --> 00:45:24,289
That's what they call good ol'
Southern hospitality.

846
00:45:26,124 --> 00:45:32,263
*

847
00:45:38,904 --> 00:45:39,971
Okay, now.

848
00:45:40,005 --> 00:45:44,442
*

849
00:45:47,145 --> 00:45:50,816
I promise, if I get out of this,
I'm going to Jenny Craig.

850
00:45:50,849 --> 00:45:56,988
*

851
00:46:09,567 --> 00:46:11,536
Password. Password.

852
00:46:11,569 --> 00:46:13,571
"Long beard."

853
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:17,308
*

854
00:46:17,342 --> 00:46:19,277
"Moonshine."

855
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:25,450
*

856
00:46:30,856 --> 00:46:32,190
You need a little bit more
black pepper in there,

857
00:46:32,223 --> 00:46:33,558
and then you got something.

858
00:46:33,591 --> 00:46:36,161
- Okay.
- What do we got here?

859
00:46:36,194 --> 00:46:39,831
*

860
00:46:39,865 --> 00:46:42,567
That's not bad. Needs a touch
more paprika in that rub though.

861
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,035
Thank you.

862
00:46:44,069 --> 00:46:49,407
*

863
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,477
What the hell'd
you put in this, coullion?

864
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:55,280
Who the hell you calling
"coullion," coullion?

865
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:56,381
Who the hell is you?

866
00:46:56,414 --> 00:46:58,283
Where's Carmen?

867
00:46:58,316 --> 00:46:59,918
*

868
00:46:59,951 --> 00:47:01,386
Hold on!

869
00:47:01,419 --> 00:47:03,254
You didn't answer
my friend's question.

870
00:47:03,288 --> 00:47:04,355
Where's Carmen?

871
00:47:04,389 --> 00:47:09,227
*

872
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,196
"I married my cousin."

873
00:47:11,229 --> 00:47:13,098
Damn!

874
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,067
*

875
00:47:18,603 --> 00:47:21,539
Hello, 1988.

876
00:47:26,411 --> 00:47:28,379
*

877
00:47:28,413 --> 00:47:32,017
All right, cochons,
who gonna die first?

878
00:47:34,252 --> 00:47:35,320
Aw, shit!

879
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:37,355
*

880
00:47:37,388 --> 00:47:39,224
Come on. Come on, come on.

881
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:42,627
*

882
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:45,063
- Where is she?
- You go to hell!

883
00:47:45,096 --> 00:47:46,965
*

884
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:55,540
*

885
00:47:57,976 --> 00:47:58,977
Jawn, you in there?

886
00:48:00,111 --> 00:48:03,381
*

887
00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:07,218
Okay. Now, where is she?

888
00:48:07,252 --> 00:48:09,287
You go to hell, salope!

889
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,989
All right!

890
00:48:16,494 --> 00:48:19,597
Okay, now where's Carmen?

891
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:22,133
- Fuck you!
- Okay.

892
00:48:22,167 --> 00:48:25,003
No, no, no, no! No! No!

893
00:48:25,036 --> 00:48:26,271
Okay! I'll tell you!

894
00:48:26,304 --> 00:48:28,539
I'll tell you!
I'll tell you!

895
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:31,943
She's over at the compound
in Greenwell Springs!

896
00:48:31,977 --> 00:48:36,281
You're gonna give me
the address and your car keys.

897
00:48:36,314 --> 00:48:37,282
Just take 'em!

898
00:48:38,516 --> 00:48:41,186
*

899
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:42,988
I'll check her room!

900
00:48:43,021 --> 00:48:49,160
*

901
00:48:57,235 --> 00:49:00,171
Do you mind, you Peeping Tom
motherfucker?

902
00:49:00,205 --> 00:49:01,206
This here door wouldn't--

903
00:49:01,239 --> 00:49:02,207
Just back that ass up

904
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,009
outta here.

905
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:16,354
Get me Harris.

906
00:49:27,165 --> 00:49:29,367
Please enter your destination.

907
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,770
I guess fat guys with big beards
also have nice trucks.

908
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,708
I don't know
how to get back.

909
00:49:37,742 --> 00:49:39,210
What?

910
00:49:39,244 --> 00:49:40,778
I pressed in
the wrong address,

911
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,214
and I don't know how to
go back and delete it.

912
00:49:43,248 --> 00:49:45,450
Try pressing "delete."

913
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:46,617
Where's "delete"?

914
00:49:47,652 --> 00:49:49,487
On the keyboard.

915
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:55,060
There, no need.

916
00:49:55,093 --> 00:49:56,427
We've got some help.

917
00:50:07,172 --> 00:50:08,406
Whew.

918
00:50:08,439 --> 00:50:09,407
Hey.

919
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,641
Thank goodness, fellas.

920
00:50:10,675 --> 00:50:12,543
We had no idea
where we were going.

921
00:50:12,577 --> 00:50:15,280
Freeze and put your hands
over your head!

922
00:50:15,313 --> 00:50:16,481
Hold on a second.
What the hell's going on--

923
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:17,515
Shut your mouth

924
00:50:17,548 --> 00:50:19,084
and put your hands in the air!

925
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:27,525
*

926
00:50:30,328 --> 00:50:32,763
Well, well, well.

927
00:50:32,797 --> 00:50:34,565
Fancy meeting you fellas
out here...

928
00:50:34,599 --> 00:50:37,502
in the middle
of nowhere.

929
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:40,071
I gotta tell you,

930
00:50:40,105 --> 00:50:43,608
it ain't the safest place
for out-of-towners like you.

931
00:50:43,641 --> 00:50:45,143
You lowlife
son of a bitch.

932
00:50:46,177 --> 00:50:47,378
Try.

933
00:51:08,766 --> 00:51:10,135
What happened?

934
00:51:10,168 --> 00:51:11,702
Turns out they weren't willing

935
00:51:11,736 --> 00:51:14,572
to help with directions.

936
00:51:17,642 --> 00:51:21,412
Well, rise and shine,
Mr. Vega.

937
00:51:21,446 --> 00:51:22,713
Where you taking us?

938
00:51:22,747 --> 00:51:24,549
It's a surprise.

939
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:27,118
But I can tell you
this much--

940
00:51:27,152 --> 00:51:29,854
The view
is something special.

941
00:51:32,557 --> 00:51:34,759
I been goin' on and on,

942
00:51:34,792 --> 00:51:36,861
tryin' to get you boys
not to get involved,

943
00:51:36,894 --> 00:51:39,264
but you wouldn't listen.

944
00:51:39,297 --> 00:51:40,798
Now...

945
00:51:40,831 --> 00:51:43,501
it's time
to pay the price.

946
00:51:43,534 --> 00:51:44,869
Look, homie,

947
00:51:44,902 --> 00:51:46,437
we're gonna give you
one last chance

948
00:51:46,471 --> 00:51:47,805
to redeem yourself.

949
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:50,175
- Yeah.
- You let us go,

950
00:51:50,208 --> 00:51:52,310
and we won't kill you
when this is all over.

951
00:51:55,513 --> 00:51:57,848
What you been smokin', brah?

952
00:51:57,882 --> 00:52:00,218
The jig is up.

953
00:52:00,251 --> 00:52:01,886
Y'all lose.

954
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:04,622
You're never gonna
get away with it.

955
00:52:04,655 --> 00:52:06,657
I'm the police chief.

956
00:52:06,691 --> 00:52:08,426
I'm the shit around here.

957
00:52:10,861 --> 00:52:15,833
*

958
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:18,536
Here we go, gentlemen.

959
00:52:18,569 --> 00:52:21,406
I'm about to find y'all
a nice little piece

960
00:52:21,439 --> 00:52:25,843
of private swampland
to drop y'all into.

961
00:52:25,876 --> 00:52:28,679
I wish you two
a bon voyage.

962
00:52:31,282 --> 00:52:33,284
C'est la vie.

963
00:52:39,224 --> 00:52:45,363
*

964
00:52:57,808 --> 00:52:59,744
- Hello?
- Reynolds Oil Refinery.

965
00:52:59,777 --> 00:53:02,680
East gate. 6:00.

966
00:53:02,713 --> 00:53:05,350
Your wife brings the money.
Alone.

967
00:53:05,383 --> 00:53:08,986
We see anyone else there,
your daughter dies.

968
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:11,289
Hey look,
now hang on one second.

969
00:53:11,322 --> 00:53:12,457
Hello?

970
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:13,558
Hello!

971
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:22,333
*

972
00:53:23,768 --> 00:53:25,336
Uh, excuse me.

973
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:27,305
I'm lookin'
for Chief Broussard.

974
00:53:27,338 --> 00:53:29,307
He said he'd be back
in 20 minutes.

975
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:31,476
I'll wait.

976
00:53:33,911 --> 00:53:37,848
*

977
00:53:54,665 --> 00:53:57,468
Any of you boys
wanna play canasta?

978
00:53:57,502 --> 00:53:59,704
We--we could
use a third.

979
00:54:02,873 --> 00:54:06,311
I don't know how the hell
we gon' get outta this.

980
00:54:06,344 --> 00:54:09,380
It don't look like they're
passing out any parachutes.

981
00:54:09,414 --> 00:54:11,382
Yeah--

982
00:54:14,819 --> 00:54:17,522
Son of a bitch!

983
00:54:18,656 --> 00:54:19,790
Bernie, you all right?

984
00:54:19,824 --> 00:54:21,426
This is real bad!

985
00:54:21,459 --> 00:54:22,660
He needs some help, man!

986
00:54:24,629 --> 00:54:28,032
He had a liver transplant
and his body's rejecting it!

987
00:54:28,065 --> 00:54:30,768
If we don't hold him down,
he'll choke on his tongue!

988
00:54:31,869 --> 00:54:33,671
Son of a--

989
00:54:33,704 --> 00:54:35,440
Come on now! We need some help!

990
00:54:47,385 --> 00:54:52,056
*

991
00:54:57,027 --> 00:55:03,368
*

992
00:55:11,442 --> 00:55:12,610
*

993
00:55:12,643 --> 00:55:14,445
Night-night, homie.

994
00:55:21,619 --> 00:55:22,820
Well, that's great.

995
00:55:22,853 --> 00:55:24,855
You know how to fly
one of these things?

996
00:55:24,889 --> 00:55:27,692
Come on. I've seen Top Gun
a hundred times.

997
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,068
We need to figure out
how we gonna land this baby.

998
00:55:38,102 --> 00:55:40,705
See if there's an instruction
manual in the glove compartment.

999
00:55:40,738 --> 00:55:42,407
Glove compartment?

1000
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:45,109
Mexican, this ain't
your daddy's Eldorado! Shit!

1001
00:55:48,646 --> 00:55:51,048
You know what?
This looks like somethin'.

1002
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:52,683
Hey, hey! Jesus Christ, Vega!

1003
00:55:52,717 --> 00:55:55,453
You just can't start
blindly pulling on shit!

1004
00:55:57,488 --> 00:55:59,757
*

1005
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:00,825
God damn!

1006
00:56:01,992 --> 00:56:03,694
My boy knows
how to fly a plane!

1007
00:56:04,829 --> 00:56:07,732
*

1008
00:56:07,765 --> 00:56:11,135
Okay, now. I think we need
to slow it up a bit. Okay?

1009
00:56:11,168 --> 00:56:12,937
That's the part
I'm not too sure about.

1010
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:15,440
*

1011
00:56:15,473 --> 00:56:16,841
That shit ain't workin', man!

1012
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:19,677
I'm trying everything!

1013
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:21,812
Try harder, man!
That shit ain't working!

1014
00:56:22,947 --> 00:56:25,049
*

1015
00:56:27,151 --> 00:56:28,619
Slow down!

1016
00:56:28,653 --> 00:56:30,555
*

1017
00:56:34,925 --> 00:56:37,695
Ah, ah, my back hurts, ah!

1018
00:57:06,924 --> 00:57:08,993
- Oh, crap!
- Oh, crap!

1019
00:57:18,636 --> 00:57:20,671
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, shit!

1020
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:32,517
No wonder your ass
is taking the bus.

1021
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:34,719
You can't drive
anything worth shit!

1022
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:01,011
Ah!

1023
00:58:21,666 --> 00:58:24,001
Thank you for flying
Mexican Airlines.

1024
00:58:30,975 --> 00:58:37,114
*

1025
00:59:01,639 --> 00:59:02,873
No reception.

1026
00:59:04,975 --> 00:59:06,010
Where the hell
you going?

1027
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:07,111
I'm going to get help.

1028
00:59:07,144 --> 00:59:08,278
Out in the middle of nowhere?

1029
00:59:08,312 --> 00:59:09,747
We're probably 50 miles away

1030
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,348
from anything, man.
I ain't walking.

1031
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:14,018
- Well, then stay here.
- Oh, man, you kidding?

1032
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:16,787
What about all these
damn gators and werewolves

1033
00:59:16,821 --> 00:59:18,222
and all that shit?

1034
00:59:18,255 --> 00:59:19,957
All right, hold on.

1035
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:24,061
Bernie, look, I ain't
got time for this shit.

1036
00:59:24,094 --> 00:59:26,130
Now you're either
coming or staying.

1037
00:59:26,163 --> 00:59:28,232
But you can't have it
both ways.

1038
00:59:31,001 --> 00:59:32,269
What the hell is that?

1039
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:37,742
*

1040
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:56,226
*

1041
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:27,157
Damn.

1042
01:00:27,191 --> 01:00:29,359
Don't matter if you're
in LA or Baton Rouge.

1043
01:00:29,393 --> 01:00:32,697
Everybody has
God damn rush hour traffic.

1044
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:36,701
What the hell are we
supposed to do now?

1045
01:00:36,734 --> 01:00:38,102
Use the shoulder, homie.

1046
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:44,274
*

1047
01:01:11,201 --> 01:01:14,471
Security's tighter
than the Ugandan Consulate.

1048
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:16,373
How the hell
are we gon' get in?

1049
01:01:16,406 --> 01:01:18,342
Why you always gotta be
sweating everything?

1050
01:01:18,375 --> 01:01:19,744
We got this.

1051
01:01:19,777 --> 01:01:20,911
Yeah.

1052
01:01:24,749 --> 01:01:27,051
What the hell you boys
think you're doin'?

1053
01:01:27,084 --> 01:01:29,153
Uh, lost
a contact lens.

1054
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:30,888
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1055
01:01:30,921 --> 01:01:32,322
Let's see.

1056
01:01:32,356 --> 01:01:33,824
Ah! Here it is.

1057
01:01:35,225 --> 01:01:36,761
Found it.

1058
01:01:38,295 --> 01:01:39,296
Oh, good.

1059
01:01:39,329 --> 01:01:40,765
You got that?

1060
01:01:40,798 --> 01:01:41,832
Uh-huh.

1061
01:01:41,866 --> 01:01:43,067
- Got it?
- Yeah.

1062
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:45,970
I guess we'll be going.

1063
01:01:46,003 --> 01:01:47,738
Freeze, assholes.

1064
01:01:53,778 --> 01:01:55,279
I know you.

1065
01:01:55,312 --> 01:01:56,981
You're those
two old fuckers.

1066
01:01:57,014 --> 01:01:59,049
- Yeah.
- That's us.

1067
01:01:59,083 --> 01:02:00,785
Oh, shit!

1068
01:02:00,818 --> 01:02:03,053
Man, you old geezers
are bad ass!

1069
01:02:03,087 --> 01:02:05,355
- Thanks, man.
- Appreciate that.

1070
01:02:05,389 --> 01:02:08,358
Yeah. We all real big fans.

1071
01:02:08,392 --> 01:02:09,894
- All right.
- Unfortunately,

1072
01:02:09,927 --> 01:02:11,528
I'm still gonna
have to kill y'all.

1073
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:12,763
Excuse me?

1074
01:02:12,797 --> 01:02:13,864
What?

1075
01:02:13,898 --> 01:02:15,332
You boys been trespassing.

1076
01:02:15,365 --> 01:02:17,367
Trespassing's grounds
for shooting.

1077
01:02:17,401 --> 01:02:21,405
Now look, there's no reason
to shoot two old guys.

1078
01:02:21,438 --> 01:02:24,208
Sorry, brahs.
Just doing my job.

1079
01:02:25,342 --> 01:02:27,111
*

1080
01:02:29,313 --> 01:02:31,248
Lights out, ho.

1081
01:02:31,281 --> 01:02:33,283
*

1082
01:02:33,317 --> 01:02:35,185
What about diplomacy, Earl?

1083
01:02:35,219 --> 01:02:37,187
Screw diplomacy.

1084
01:02:37,221 --> 01:02:38,555
*

1085
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:40,858
Now let's go
get my daughter.

1086
01:02:40,891 --> 01:02:47,031
*

1087
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:02,947
Any ideas?

1088
01:03:05,149 --> 01:03:07,484
That one.

1089
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:19,529
*

1090
01:03:35,612 --> 01:03:41,952
*

1091
01:03:58,402 --> 01:04:00,938
How the hell we supposed
to know where she is?

1092
01:04:00,971 --> 01:04:04,408
*

1093
01:04:04,441 --> 01:04:07,978
Something tells me
we've found her.

1094
01:04:08,012 --> 01:04:10,480
Any suggestions?

1095
01:04:10,514 --> 01:04:12,249
Not one.

1096
01:04:15,385 --> 01:04:17,121
Get down there!

1097
01:04:17,154 --> 01:04:18,288
Let's go.

1098
01:04:18,322 --> 01:04:21,926
*

1099
01:04:21,959 --> 01:04:22,960
Damn, Earl.

1100
01:04:27,998 --> 01:04:32,502
*

1101
01:04:32,536 --> 01:04:34,504
Well, hell,
it's about damn time.

1102
01:04:34,538 --> 01:04:36,540
You know how he likes
to make an entrance.

1103
01:04:36,573 --> 01:04:38,242
Daddy! What are you doin' here?

1104
01:04:38,275 --> 01:04:41,045
What do you think?
You okay?

1105
01:04:41,078 --> 01:04:43,280
Okay, now hey, we gotta
get outta here. Now!

1106
01:04:43,313 --> 01:04:45,449
You're gonna need this.

1107
01:04:48,118 --> 01:04:52,389
Let's go get
those motherfuckers.

1108
01:04:52,422 --> 01:04:54,491
* In time of war
my front line *

1109
01:04:54,524 --> 01:04:57,061
* I'm in fatigues, let 'em know
that it's go time *

1110
01:04:57,094 --> 01:04:59,263
* Never fall back,
don't fall behind *

1111
01:04:59,296 --> 01:05:01,966
* Never be blind,
read between the lines *

1112
01:05:01,999 --> 01:05:04,434
* Never testify,
never suicide *

1113
01:05:04,468 --> 01:05:07,237
* Never dislike,
never show your cries *

1114
01:05:07,271 --> 01:05:09,639
* 100 by here,
do it on the fly *

1115
01:05:09,673 --> 01:05:12,376
* We ain't perfect either,
but Lord knows we try *

1116
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:15,045
* Take actions, reactions,
ain't no right *

1117
01:05:15,079 --> 01:05:17,547
* Gotta come out blazin'
in the heat of the night *

1118
01:05:17,581 --> 01:05:20,284
* Be ready for war
or be ready to fall *

1119
01:05:20,317 --> 01:05:22,686
* You best be careful
what you askin' for *

1120
01:05:22,719 --> 01:05:25,355
* When it rains, it pours,
kill the source at the core *

1121
01:05:25,389 --> 01:05:28,092
* Suited up in fatigues
'cause we ready for war *

1122
01:05:28,125 --> 01:05:30,560
* If you ain't ready for war
you won't be ready for more *

1123
01:05:30,594 --> 01:05:33,230
* You best be careful
what you asking for *

1124
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:35,665
* When it rains, it pours,
kill the source at the core *

1125
01:05:35,699 --> 01:05:39,103
* Suited up in fatigues,
'cause I'm ready for war *

1126
01:05:39,136 --> 01:05:41,638
* And then the nation drawin'
forces like a congregation *

1127
01:05:41,671 --> 01:05:44,308
* Ain't no way you're holding
back to the day you make it *

1128
01:05:44,341 --> 01:05:46,743
* Always gotta try and prove
yourself, demonstration *

1129
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:49,413
* Try to cut 'em up real quick
like a Haitian *

1130
01:05:49,446 --> 01:05:52,349
* Show no fear here when
it comes to complications *

1131
01:05:54,151 --> 01:05:55,585
Shit!

1132
01:06:20,377 --> 01:06:24,081
*

1133
01:06:24,114 --> 01:06:26,550
Take that, bitches!

1134
01:06:27,617 --> 01:06:28,585
Very impressive.

1135
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:31,555
Drop your weapons.

1136
01:06:33,757 --> 01:06:35,625
Drop your weapons!

1137
01:06:38,228 --> 01:06:39,529
*

1138
01:06:39,563 --> 01:06:41,665
Geoffrey, what the hell
are you doin'?

1139
01:06:41,698 --> 01:06:44,534
I know this is
all quite confusing.

1140
01:06:44,568 --> 01:06:46,570
But the truth
of the matter is,

1141
01:06:46,603 --> 01:06:49,239
the plan got derailed a bit
by your boys here.

1142
01:06:49,273 --> 01:06:50,807
Geoffrey, if this is
your way of eloping,

1143
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,576
you should've came clean
before my daddy

1144
01:06:52,609 --> 01:06:54,044
started signing checks.

1145
01:06:54,078 --> 01:06:56,513
Can't get
a deposit back now.

1146
01:06:56,546 --> 01:06:59,283
I always loved
your sense of humor.

1147
01:06:59,316 --> 01:07:01,518
Hey!

1148
01:07:01,551 --> 01:07:03,487
Put the gun down.

1149
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,422
I'm not going to hurt her...

1150
01:07:05,455 --> 01:07:08,392
unless somebody
tries to play hero.

1151
01:07:08,425 --> 01:07:11,628
Now, move into
the other room.

1152
01:07:11,661 --> 01:07:13,597
Now!

1153
01:07:13,630 --> 01:07:18,368
*

1154
01:07:18,402 --> 01:07:20,204
You too, lovey.

1155
01:07:20,237 --> 01:07:22,372
Off you go.

1156
01:07:22,406 --> 01:07:24,074
Who are you?

1157
01:07:29,413 --> 01:07:32,682
You had no intentions
of marrying her, did you?

1158
01:07:32,716 --> 01:07:34,518
It's not that she's not
a wonderful young lady.

1159
01:07:34,551 --> 01:07:38,522
And if the circumstances
were different, who knows?

1160
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:41,091
But this is
a business opportunity

1161
01:07:41,125 --> 01:07:44,128
that my cousin and I
couldn't pass up.

1162
01:07:44,161 --> 01:07:45,462
Your cousin?

1163
01:07:45,495 --> 01:07:47,431
As in the police chief?

1164
01:07:47,464 --> 01:07:49,666
Yes.

1165
01:07:49,699 --> 01:07:52,169
You would be correct,
Mr. Vega.

1166
01:07:52,202 --> 01:07:53,503
Pretty sharp you are.

1167
01:07:53,537 --> 01:07:55,239
Just leave my daughter with us.

1168
01:07:55,272 --> 01:07:57,141
I'll see that you
get your money.

1169
01:07:57,174 --> 01:07:59,709
Oh, I wish I could
take you up on it, Earl,

1170
01:07:59,743 --> 01:08:02,546
but for some reason
I don't believe you.

1171
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:04,348
In addition,
we've got big plans for Carmen

1172
01:08:04,381 --> 01:08:06,383
to help us
get out of the country.

1173
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:09,786
You son of a bitch!

1174
01:08:09,819 --> 01:08:12,489
Calm down, Earl.

1175
01:08:12,522 --> 01:08:15,225
We're gonna get you.

1176
01:08:15,259 --> 01:08:17,794
I highly doubt that,
Mr. Vega.

1177
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:22,866
You see, this is the end
of the line for you lads.

1178
01:08:25,202 --> 01:08:29,339
With that, I must wish you
a heartfelt goodbye.

1179
01:08:29,373 --> 01:08:31,608
Lucas!

1180
01:08:31,641 --> 01:08:32,642
Come on, lovey.

1181
01:08:32,676 --> 01:08:35,879
Off we go, lovey.

1182
01:08:39,649 --> 01:08:41,651
Oh, shit.

1183
01:08:46,690 --> 01:08:52,829
*

1184
01:09:04,674 --> 01:09:10,814
*

1185
01:09:38,642 --> 01:09:44,648
*

1186
01:09:44,681 --> 01:09:47,517
Looks like we gon' have
some barbecue tonight.

1187
01:09:47,551 --> 01:09:49,519
I hope they like dark meat.

1188
01:09:49,553 --> 01:09:51,988
It's too tight.
They're too tight.

1189
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:53,990
Come on, my man,
you gotta have somethin'

1190
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:56,260
in that fanny pack of yours.

1191
01:09:56,293 --> 01:09:57,627
My hands are tied.

1192
01:09:57,661 --> 01:09:59,629
We're screwed, fellas.

1193
01:09:59,663 --> 01:10:01,931
No way out of this one.

1194
01:10:05,802 --> 01:10:09,406
"Hey, come on.
Let's go to Louisiana."

1195
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:12,842
Yeah! "A little vacation,
get away from it all."

1196
01:10:12,876 --> 01:10:14,644
Oh, now it's all my fault?

1197
01:10:14,678 --> 01:10:16,980
You bet your ass
it's your fault.

1198
01:10:17,013 --> 01:10:19,883
Can't you ever take
responsibility for anything?

1199
01:10:19,916 --> 01:10:23,653
Yeah. If you hadn't pushed us
out here, I wouldn't have been--

1200
01:10:23,687 --> 01:10:25,589
Enough!

1201
01:10:25,622 --> 01:10:29,293
Can't a man even die in peace?

1202
01:10:34,331 --> 01:10:37,501
*

1203
01:10:37,534 --> 01:10:40,437
I'm sorry, man.

1204
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:41,438
No.

1205
01:10:42,472 --> 01:10:44,974
It was a good ride.

1206
01:10:46,042 --> 01:10:47,344
- It was, huh?
- Yeah.

1207
01:10:49,779 --> 01:10:55,585
*

1208
01:10:58,021 --> 01:11:00,590
*

1209
01:11:05,829 --> 01:11:07,764
Hey, do you guys
need a lift?

1210
01:11:07,797 --> 01:11:10,934
It's Ronny!
What the hell?

1211
01:11:10,967 --> 01:11:13,337
*

1212
01:11:13,370 --> 01:11:15,705
Get in the truck!
Get in the truck!

1213
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:20,644
Come on, go!

1214
01:11:20,677 --> 01:11:22,011
*

1215
01:11:24,648 --> 01:11:30,787
*

1216
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:43,900
*

1217
01:11:43,933 --> 01:11:47,003
You saved our lives!
My white baby boy!

1218
01:11:47,036 --> 01:11:48,605
You saved our lives!

1219
01:11:48,638 --> 01:11:50,106
How did you know
we were here?

1220
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:53,343
I didn't. I hid
in the back of the car.

1221
01:11:53,377 --> 01:11:55,912
And that gives us
exactly 22 minutes to make it

1222
01:11:55,945 --> 01:11:57,481
to that Reynolds Oil Refinery

1223
01:11:57,514 --> 01:11:58,915
before Mom makes the exchange.

1224
01:11:58,948 --> 01:12:00,417
- Twenty-two minutes?
- You got it.

1225
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:02,452
That place is 45 minutes away.

1226
01:12:02,486 --> 01:12:04,354
Then you better
step on it, kid.

1227
01:12:06,790 --> 01:12:09,459
*

1228
01:12:09,493 --> 01:12:11,828
They're gonna have
a whole damn army with them.

1229
01:12:11,861 --> 01:12:14,364
We're gon' need
some help, man.

1230
01:12:14,398 --> 01:12:15,932
Ronald,
give me your cell phone.

1231
01:12:15,965 --> 01:12:22,406
*

1232
01:12:28,478 --> 01:12:34,618
*

1233
01:12:46,863 --> 01:12:48,832
Geoffrey?

1234
01:12:48,865 --> 01:12:51,568
Hello, Lois.

1235
01:12:51,601 --> 01:12:55,439
I know this isn't
what you expected,

1236
01:12:55,472 --> 01:12:57,741
but if you'd
just hand over the money...

1237
01:12:57,774 --> 01:13:00,577
I'll get you Carmen.

1238
01:13:02,812 --> 01:13:07,016
You scum-sucking pig.

1239
01:13:07,050 --> 01:13:09,185
Hand over the money.

1240
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:11,054
You go screw yourself.

1241
01:13:13,690 --> 01:13:16,960
*

1242
01:13:16,993 --> 01:13:19,429
I admire your courage,

1243
01:13:19,463 --> 01:13:22,699
but it's not worth it.

1244
01:13:22,732 --> 01:13:26,536
Not giving you nothing
till you hand her over.

1245
01:13:26,570 --> 01:13:28,738
Suit yourself.

1246
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:48,124
*

1247
01:13:48,157 --> 01:13:50,193
Let's kick some geriatric ass!

1248
01:13:50,226 --> 01:13:51,828
*

1249
01:13:54,230 --> 01:13:55,198
*

1250
01:13:55,231 --> 01:13:57,233
Oh! Earl!

1251
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:59,002
Come on.
Get out of the car.

1252
01:13:59,035 --> 01:14:01,004
Earl!

1253
01:14:01,037 --> 01:14:02,739
Earl, are you all right?

1254
01:14:02,772 --> 01:14:04,941
Yeah.
You done real good, baby.

1255
01:14:06,576 --> 01:14:08,912
Whoo! Look at this!
Baby boy to the rescue!

1256
01:14:08,945 --> 01:14:11,147
Oh, I'm so happy to see you!

1257
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:13,783
Ohh, ohh!

1258
01:14:13,817 --> 01:14:16,119
Damn cops are late
even in Louisiana.

1259
01:14:18,755 --> 01:14:24,928
*

1260
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:26,262
Hands in the air!

1261
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:32,636
*

1262
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:36,973
Jesus Christ there,
Geoffrey.

1263
01:14:39,008 --> 01:14:43,513
How the hell you let this thing
get this far out of hand?

1264
01:14:43,547 --> 01:14:46,916
Son of a bitch.

1265
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:48,685
I believe this
belongs to me.

1266
01:14:48,718 --> 01:14:50,787
Hey! Oww!

1267
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:55,659
*

1268
01:14:55,692 --> 01:14:58,261
Mr. Vega.

1269
01:14:58,294 --> 01:15:01,264
You done gone
and messed everything up.

1270
01:15:01,297 --> 01:15:03,733
And now...

1271
01:15:03,767 --> 01:15:09,272
everybody's gonna
have to die for it.

1272
01:15:09,305 --> 01:15:11,140
Starting with you.

1273
01:15:12,776 --> 01:15:14,978
You bad ass.

1274
01:15:15,011 --> 01:15:15,979
Freeze!

1275
01:15:17,781 --> 01:15:21,017
Drop it, Julius!

1276
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:24,053
Oh, Pete.
Now, what you doin' here?

1277
01:15:24,087 --> 01:15:27,090
It's over.
Drop the gun!

1278
01:15:27,123 --> 01:15:30,560
Boy, you done got yourself
into somethin'

1279
01:15:30,594 --> 01:15:34,163
way above y'all heads.

1280
01:15:34,197 --> 01:15:37,066
Now if I was you,

1281
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:39,869
I'd go on,
go back home,

1282
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:42,005
take your little boys
with you.

1283
01:15:42,038 --> 01:15:43,807
Put the gun down, Julius!

1284
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:46,743
*

1285
01:15:46,776 --> 01:15:48,812
Put your hands
above your head! Now!

1286
01:15:48,845 --> 01:15:52,248
That's not gon' happen, boy!

1287
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:55,619
Best step the hell off,

1288
01:15:55,652 --> 01:15:57,621
'cause I'm about to--

1289
01:15:59,689 --> 01:16:01,357
Get the fuck back.

1290
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:03,226
Get the fuck back!

1291
01:16:03,259 --> 01:16:04,694
Hell no!

1292
01:16:04,728 --> 01:16:06,095
God damn!

1293
01:16:11,334 --> 01:16:14,137
*

1294
01:16:14,170 --> 01:16:16,139
You shot my fanny pack!

1295
01:16:16,172 --> 01:16:22,311
*

1296
01:16:41,264 --> 01:16:43,366
*

1297
01:16:43,399 --> 01:16:46,302
- Frank! You okay?
- Yeah.

1298
01:16:46,335 --> 01:16:49,405
God damn! That fanny pack
saved your life! What?

1299
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:53,743
It was Ronald's watch.

1300
01:16:53,777 --> 01:16:56,112
It take a lickin'
and keep on tickin'!

1301
01:16:58,782 --> 01:17:00,049
Damn, Green Machine!

1302
01:17:00,083 --> 01:17:02,952
Is that you or a lead pipe
in your pocket?

1303
01:17:05,388 --> 01:17:07,056
*

1304
01:17:07,090 --> 01:17:08,958
Stay down, bitch.

1305
01:17:15,364 --> 01:17:21,705
*

1306
01:17:24,107 --> 01:17:26,175
Well, I guess
that's about it.

1307
01:17:26,209 --> 01:17:27,711
Oh, come on, boys.

1308
01:17:27,744 --> 01:17:28,778
You sure you don't wanna
chill out here

1309
01:17:28,812 --> 01:17:30,046
a few more days?

1310
01:17:30,079 --> 01:17:32,148
We'll make it
worth your while.

1311
01:17:32,181 --> 01:17:35,218
Well, we'd love to, but Bernie's
got a doctor's appointment

1312
01:17:35,251 --> 01:17:36,252
first thing tomorrow morning.

1313
01:17:36,285 --> 01:17:37,687
All right, then.

1314
01:17:37,721 --> 01:17:39,288
Bring it on in
for the sweet thang.

1315
01:17:39,322 --> 01:17:42,325
Oh, oh!

1316
01:17:42,358 --> 01:17:44,994
You have no idea how grateful
I am to both of you.

1317
01:17:45,028 --> 01:17:47,396
- Thank you so much.
- You're gonna be all right.

1318
01:17:47,430 --> 01:17:49,833
Hell yeah. Who needs another man
when I have you two?

1319
01:17:52,101 --> 01:17:54,470
You know, you boys
are welcome here any time.

1320
01:17:59,909 --> 01:18:01,978
You got about five more minutes
before you hit the road.

1321
01:18:02,011 --> 01:18:03,412
Can I borrow you two a moment?

1322
01:18:03,446 --> 01:18:05,715
Yeah. All right.

1323
01:18:08,351 --> 01:18:11,120
I'm deeply indebted
to both of you.

1324
01:18:11,154 --> 01:18:13,356
You brought my child back.

1325
01:18:13,389 --> 01:18:17,093
Words can never express
how much I appreciate that.

1326
01:18:17,126 --> 01:18:19,996
But you gave me
somethin' else.

1327
01:18:20,029 --> 01:18:22,198
For the first time
in 30 years, guys--

1328
01:18:22,231 --> 01:18:23,933
30 years--

1329
01:18:23,967 --> 01:18:25,935
I feel alive again.

1330
01:18:25,969 --> 01:18:29,305
And because of that,
I've found my true purpose.

1331
01:18:29,338 --> 01:18:32,441
I wanna bring justice
back to those places

1332
01:18:32,475 --> 01:18:35,511
that have been
completely drained of it,

1333
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:38,181
and I wanna do it
with the two of you.

1334
01:18:38,214 --> 01:18:42,786
Think of it as
three old guys kickin' ass.

1335
01:18:42,819 --> 01:18:44,287
*

1336
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:46,089
Sounds like a great idea,
Earl, but--

1337
01:18:46,122 --> 01:18:47,123
Yeah, yeah.

1338
01:18:47,156 --> 01:18:48,958
You know,
Bernie and I

1339
01:18:48,992 --> 01:18:50,794
have other
responsibilities.

1340
01:18:50,827 --> 01:18:52,061
Oh, Frank, I'm aware of that.

1341
01:18:52,095 --> 01:18:53,763
I know you got
your community center,

1342
01:18:53,797 --> 01:18:55,398
and of course Bernie's
got his liquor store.

1343
01:18:55,431 --> 01:18:57,266
I'm not asking you
to give that up.

1344
01:18:57,300 --> 01:19:01,037
Look, I wanna make it as easy
as possible for both you guys.

1345
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:03,472
I will fund
the entire operation,

1346
01:19:03,506 --> 01:19:06,209
and I will put
the both of you on salary.

1347
01:19:06,242 --> 01:19:08,812
That way you won't have to worry
about paying your bills,

1348
01:19:08,845 --> 01:19:11,214
especially those medical bills.

1349
01:19:11,247 --> 01:19:13,249
You serious, man?

1350
01:19:13,282 --> 01:19:15,084
As a liver transplant.

1351
01:19:15,118 --> 01:19:17,253
*

1352
01:19:17,286 --> 01:19:19,322
So what do you say, guys?

1353
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:25,228
You ready
to clean up this country?

1354
01:19:27,363 --> 01:19:29,265
*

1355
01:19:29,298 --> 01:19:31,868
- * When you hear that
- * Bang-bang-bang

1356
01:19:31,901 --> 01:19:34,270
- * Duck and run for cover
- * Bang-bang-bang

1357
01:19:34,303 --> 01:19:37,106
- * When you hear that
- * Bang-bang-bang

1358
01:19:37,140 --> 01:19:38,241
* Duck and run for cover

1359
01:19:41,878 --> 01:19:43,379
Oh, Bernie.

1360
01:19:43,412 --> 01:19:46,449
There is more to you
than meets the eye.

1361
01:19:46,482 --> 01:19:50,186
I must say, I'm intrigued.

1362
01:19:50,219 --> 01:19:51,921
As am I, Kate.

1363
01:19:51,955 --> 01:19:53,923
As am I.

1364
01:19:56,059 --> 01:19:58,027
- Mm.
- Mm.

1365
01:19:58,061 --> 01:20:00,229
Excuse me, sir, but you're
going to have to return

1366
01:20:00,263 --> 01:20:03,132
to your assigned seat.

1367
01:20:05,568 --> 01:20:08,104
*

1368
01:20:10,539 --> 01:20:15,511
*

1369
01:20:17,981 --> 01:20:21,417
* Ooh, I'm just
playin' the game *

1370
01:20:21,450 --> 01:20:24,153
* We all in here
tryin' to make it out *

1371
01:20:24,187 --> 01:20:28,858
* We tryin' to escape, but
these streets won't let us go *

1372
01:20:28,892 --> 01:20:31,427
* There's got to be
a better way now *

1373
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:33,496
* I've got to go find out

1374
01:20:33,529 --> 01:20:35,631
* 'Cause I, 'cause I
can't keep playin' *

1375
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:38,267
* These streets
won't let us grow *

1376
01:20:38,301 --> 01:20:40,269
* Gotta find a way, searching
for them better days *

1377
01:20:40,303 --> 01:20:42,571
* Even under pressure I'm ahead
of where to fade away *

1378
01:20:42,605 --> 01:20:45,408
* Shining like the lights
of Vegas up in Mandalay *

1379
01:20:45,441 --> 01:20:47,977
* All you got in this life
is your family *

1380
01:20:48,011 --> 01:20:50,346
* LA to Houston,
Philly to Brooklyn *

1381
01:20:50,379 --> 01:20:52,982
* Going back and forth
in this game like Ping-Pong *

1382
01:20:53,016 --> 01:20:55,251
* Big Tank boss,
I'll get 'em while I'm gooder *

1383
01:20:55,284 --> 01:20:57,586
* See more crack in the slums
than a plumber *

1384
01:20:57,620 --> 01:21:00,023
* Line us with the bread,
slick with the butter *

1385
01:21:00,056 --> 01:21:03,059
* But the streets is hotter
than an Arizona summer *

1386
01:21:03,092 --> 01:21:05,394
* Black, brown,
minority normally *

1387
01:21:05,428 --> 01:21:08,031
* But we just can't win
against authority *

1388
01:21:08,064 --> 01:21:10,433
* Unless we realize
we the majority *

1389
01:21:10,466 --> 01:21:12,902
* And we can change
that history *

1390
01:21:12,936 --> 01:21:15,304
* My story, your story,
many stories *

1391
01:21:15,338 --> 01:21:17,606
* Walk through hell
just to get to the glory *

1392
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:19,408
- * Yeah
- * Ooh

1393
01:21:19,442 --> 01:21:21,477
* I'm just playin' the game

1394
01:21:21,510 --> 01:21:24,347
* We all in here
tryin' to make it out *

1395
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:29,052
* We tryin' to escape, but
these streets won't let us go *

1396
01:21:29,085 --> 01:21:31,988
* There's got to be
a better way now *

1397
01:21:32,021 --> 01:21:34,090
* I've got to go find out

1398
01:21:34,123 --> 01:21:36,292
* 'Cause I, 'cause I
can't keep playin' *

1399
01:21:36,325 --> 01:21:38,394
* These streets
won't let us grow *

1400
01:21:38,427 --> 01:21:41,364
* If I had wings
I would fly *

1401
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:43,232
* Blowing cush in a mile

1402
01:21:43,266 --> 01:21:45,534
* See the judge
but never testify *

1403
01:21:45,568 --> 01:21:47,070
* I was tryin' to make it out
the ghetto *

1404
01:21:47,103 --> 01:21:48,371
* Terrified from the world

1405
01:21:48,404 --> 01:21:50,306
* So Hollywood Boulevard

1406
01:21:50,339 --> 01:21:52,508
* It's the same everywhere
no matter who you are *

1407
01:21:52,541 --> 01:21:54,710
* All around the world
poverty strikes the poor *

1408
01:21:54,743 --> 01:21:57,013
* Rich stay rich,
gotta kill it at the core *

1409
01:21:57,046 --> 01:21:58,547
* Need I say more?

1410
01:21:58,581 --> 01:22:00,984
* Dreams are cut short,
news will report *

1411
01:22:01,017 --> 01:22:02,385
* Son slayed on the porch

1412
01:22:02,418 --> 01:22:04,954
* Drugs import
and then they export *

1413
01:22:04,988 --> 01:22:07,423
* The core buys more and
they rarely can afford it *

1414
01:22:07,456 --> 01:22:09,959
* Live check to check
and workin' 9:00 to 5:00 *

1415
01:22:09,993 --> 01:22:12,328
* Struggle day in, day out,
no lie *

1416
01:22:12,361 --> 01:22:14,998
* Tryin' to do better,
Lord knows I try *

1417
01:22:15,031 --> 01:22:17,600
* Only way to make it
is if I supply *

1418
01:22:17,633 --> 01:22:19,502
- * Damn
- * Ooh

1419
01:22:19,535 --> 01:22:21,704
* I'm just playin' the game

1420
01:22:21,737 --> 01:22:24,573
* We all in here
tryin' to make it out *

1421
01:22:24,607 --> 01:22:29,245
* We tryin' to escape, but
these streets won't let us go *

1422
01:22:29,278 --> 01:22:32,115
* There's got to be
a better way now *

1423
01:22:32,148 --> 01:22:34,183
* I've got to go find out

1424
01:22:34,217 --> 01:22:36,485
* 'Cause I, 'cause I
