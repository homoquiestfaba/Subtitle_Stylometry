1
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:25,105
Parents, guests, members of our distinguished faculty,

2
00:00:25,174 --> 00:00:29,143
fellow students, we've come
down this long road together,

3
00:00:29,211 --> 00:00:32,980
and now it's time for many of us to part company.

4
00:00:33,048 --> 00:00:38,653
We leave knowing our future holds
no more or less than what we make of it.

5
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,055
#... Loud guitars, fast cars #

6
00:00:41,122 --> 00:00:43,123
# And wild, wild livin' #

7
00:00:43,192 --> 00:00:45,326
# This is all we ever need #

8
00:00:45,394 --> 00:00:47,828
# Get up and go, time for the show #

9
00:00:47,896 --> 00:00:51,131
# Let's get rollin' #

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,132
# We want loud... #

11
00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:56,170
- What did I miss?
- Some crap about our future.

12
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:58,673
...a new plateau in our lives.

13
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:03,411
We will all flourish. We will all prevail.
The potential is limitless.

14
00:01:03,478 --> 00:01:08,683
This is the moment we step through
a new door with eager anticipation.

15
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,919
This is our moment. Yes, we are the future.

16
00:01:11,986 --> 00:01:13,787
We are the world.

17
00:01:15,691 --> 00:01:21,128
Good luck to you all,
and God bless America!

18
00:01:28,169 --> 00:01:31,939
Let's have a warm hand
for our valedictorian Melissa Tyler!

19
00:01:34,676 --> 00:01:35,843
Ugh!

20
00:01:38,714 --> 00:01:49,523
And now Mrs. Grober will help me to hand out the awards
to this year's graduating class of Edsel High 1991.

21
00:02:16,151 --> 00:02:17,351
Yoo-hoo!

22
00:02:18,654 --> 00:02:20,087
Yoo-hoo!

23
00:02:20,155 --> 00:02:21,121
Smile.

24
00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:23,424
Look in the camera.

25
00:02:26,662 --> 00:02:31,632
Sir, this has been the best four years of my life.

26
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,670
Don't overwhelm yourself.
The best is yet to come.

27
00:02:44,212 --> 00:02:46,013
Oh, no!

28
00:03:00,228 --> 00:03:04,565
I'm real sorry.
I don't know what to say, you know?

29
00:03:04,633 --> 00:03:09,102
Don't know what to say?
I'll tell you what to say.

30
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:17,345
"I would like to have graduated high school, but I
couldn't fit it into my dating and partying schedule,"

31
00:03:17,412 --> 00:03:23,584
or "I was too busy doing jack-shit
instead of going to my French class!"

32
00:03:23,652 --> 00:03:25,085
Herb, take a pill.

33
00:03:25,153 --> 00:03:31,625
Why didn't you tell us you were having trouble?
We could have gotten you a tutor.

34
00:03:31,693 --> 00:03:36,930
I hope you like pumping gas.
That's what I see in your future.

35
00:03:36,998 --> 00:03:41,869
I see Brad just out of dental school,
driving in his new oldsmobile...

36
00:03:41,936 --> 00:03:46,273
- BMW, Dad.
- And you're going to be checking his oil!

37
00:03:46,341 --> 00:03:50,811
Herb! Why don't I call Mrs. Grober about summer school?

38
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,315
- There is no summer school.
- There has to be summer school.

39
00:03:55,384 --> 00:04:04,592
Well, there's summer school, but Mrs. Grober's
taking the French club to France,
and the only way to make up credit is if I went...

40
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:07,160
I'll be goddamned if you think I'm gonna
send you to France for flunking high school?

41
00:04:07,228 --> 00:04:09,363
Mrs. Grober hates my guts.

42
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:12,232
I'm sorry. I really let you down.

43
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,602
There goes college this fall.

44
00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:21,341
Flunking high school's not the end of the world.
I'm calling Mrs. Grober, no matter how she feels.

45
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:28,749
Michael, son, potential failure, I love you to death,
but I want to tell you something.

46
00:04:28,817 --> 00:04:32,119
You have good intentions, but that's not enough.

47
00:04:32,186 --> 00:04:35,623
Dad, is this the "no follow-through" speech?

48
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:39,159
Right. Now, you know what your main problem is?

49
00:04:39,227 --> 00:04:43,631
- No. What?
- No follow-through.

50
00:04:43,698 --> 00:04:46,600
Michael, you've got to make things happen.

51
00:04:46,668 --> 00:04:51,672
You can't go through life irresponsibly,
and you can't depend on luck.

52
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,810
Mrs. Grober? Hello. This is Marge Corben.

53
00:05:08,323 --> 00:05:15,095
Be realistic, Monsieur Lafevre. As Finance Minister
of perhaps the most progressive nation in Europe,

54
00:05:15,163 --> 00:05:20,067
surely you must understand that your participation
is imperative to this operation.

55
00:05:20,134 --> 00:05:26,874
Anything to the contrary could be interpreted by
the European community as a lack of good faith.

56
00:05:26,942 --> 00:05:34,414
This is more than a matter of trust, Augustus.
France's gold must remain in France.

57
00:05:34,483 --> 00:05:38,418
Well, I'm very sorry you feel that way.

58
00:05:46,294 --> 00:05:47,528
Ah!

59
00:05:55,336 --> 00:05:56,837
He was followed!

60
00:06:02,811 --> 00:06:04,879
It's Blade.

61
00:06:51,693 --> 00:06:54,461
Yaah!

62
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:55,863
Aah!

63
00:06:55,931 --> 00:06:59,066
Look. Zigesfeld is hurt.

64
00:07:03,304 --> 00:07:05,072
Steranko.

65
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:09,276
Mr. Blade, I suggest you leave
before you start an international incident.

66
00:07:09,343 --> 00:07:12,713
You mean like the one you're planning?

67
00:07:12,781 --> 00:07:15,515
For business calls, you need an appointment.

68
00:07:15,584 --> 00:07:16,850
Maybe next time.

69
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:19,419
There will be no next time.

70
00:07:25,126 --> 00:07:26,293
Ah!

71
00:07:27,361 --> 00:07:28,361
Aah!

72
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:32,866
Ah!

73
00:07:32,934 --> 00:07:35,970
Aah!

74
00:07:46,948 --> 00:07:49,583
We're all saddened by Blade's death.

75
00:07:49,651 --> 00:07:54,622
Yesterday's discovery of Blade's body
leaves us in a rather precarious position.

76
00:07:54,689 --> 00:07:58,892
Not only have we forfeited our most experienced operative,

77
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,563
but we have gravely underestimated
the importance of his mission.

78
00:08:03,632 --> 00:08:07,034
Our last contact with Blade was five months ago.

79
00:08:07,102 --> 00:08:11,071
He was investigating a disturbing series of bizarre deaths

80
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:14,074
involving the Finance Ministers of
Common Market nations.

81
00:08:14,142 --> 00:08:19,079
We can now add French Finance Minister
Jacques Lafevre to the body count.

82
00:08:19,147 --> 00:08:24,051
His body was discovered with Blade's,
their murder disguised as a car accident.

83
00:08:24,119 --> 00:08:32,926
If this pattern continues, Augustus Steranko,
the newly appointed leader of the
European economic community, will be next.

84
00:08:32,994 --> 00:08:34,628
He must be protected.

85
00:08:35,697 --> 00:08:39,599
- Lieutenant Colonel Larabee.
- Please continue.

86
00:08:39,668 --> 00:08:44,104
Her majesty has contacted
the President of the United States,

87
00:08:44,172 --> 00:08:48,575
and he's deploying one of their deep-cover
operatives to our situation.

88
00:08:48,643 --> 00:08:53,113
This operative has been living under an alias
for the last five years,

89
00:08:53,181 --> 00:08:56,083
establishing deep cover in the United States.

90
00:08:56,151 --> 00:08:59,086
Nobody knows what he looks like here.

91
00:08:59,154 --> 00:09:02,022
They don't know his age, race, or background.

92
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:06,727
We do know he's arriving on Air Transat
flight 35 departing Detroit tomorrow

93
00:09:06,795 --> 00:09:08,996
under the code name "Michael Corben."

94
00:09:09,064 --> 00:09:14,134
Lieutenant Colonel Larabee's code name is "Mother."

95
00:09:15,236 --> 00:09:16,536
Kelly?

96
00:09:16,604 --> 00:09:21,075
It doesn't sound like the operative's cover
is as deep as you think.

97
00:09:21,142 --> 00:09:23,110
How do you mean that?

98
00:09:23,178 --> 00:09:25,846
No one knows what he looks like?

99
00:09:25,914 --> 00:09:30,650
- Sir, we know he's male.
- Shut up, Kelly.

100
00:09:30,719 --> 00:09:33,587
American male, age unknown,

101
00:09:33,654 --> 00:09:39,559
departing Detroit International terminal
on Air Transat flight 35 tomorrow.

102
00:09:39,627 --> 00:09:43,630
A call will be placed to him one hour before flight time.

103
00:09:43,698 --> 00:09:45,899
Excellent. I'll be there.

104
00:09:45,967 --> 00:09:48,568
I advise extreme caution.

105
00:09:48,636 --> 00:09:51,872
The man is a jackal.

106
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:58,678
By the way, Kelly, did you get his name?

107
00:09:58,747 --> 00:10:00,114
Michael Corben.

108
00:10:00,181 --> 00:10:04,017
Good morning, Monsieur Corben.
Traveling with us first-class today?

109
00:10:04,085 --> 00:10:05,219
Yes.

110
00:10:05,286 --> 00:10:09,623
White zone is for immediate
loading and unloading of passengers.

111
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,626
Corben! Michael Corben!

112
00:10:12,693 --> 00:10:15,796
Kent, my man. How's it going?

113
00:10:15,864 --> 00:10:17,297
Oh, pretty good.

114
00:10:17,365 --> 00:10:19,266
I don't believe this one.

115
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,301
This was the only way.

116
00:10:21,369 --> 00:10:23,303
I think we're very lucky.

117
00:10:23,371 --> 00:10:24,638
Lucky? Lucky?

118
00:10:24,705 --> 00:10:31,611
Yeah, I feel damn privileged to send my son
to Europe for only $300-plus a day.

119
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:33,180
Thanks, Dad.

120
00:10:34,215 --> 00:10:39,686
Oh, Mom, while I'm gone,
think about switching Dad over to decaf.

121
00:10:43,491 --> 00:10:45,625
- Michael.
- What?

122
00:10:45,693 --> 00:10:47,527
Look who's here... Melissa Tyler.

123
00:10:47,595 --> 00:10:49,163
Well, take her.

124
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,165
And lose my geek status?

125
00:10:51,232 --> 00:10:53,133
Kent, you're sticking with me.

126
00:10:53,201 --> 00:10:59,639
In the daytime we'll do the French bit,
but in the nighttime when the nerd patrol crashes,

127
00:10:59,707 --> 00:11:03,576
it's you and me, pal,
on a Parisian babe safari.

128
00:11:03,644 --> 00:11:05,112
What about Grober?

129
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:09,082
Don't worry about Grober. I can handle her.

130
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,118
Don't count on it.

131
00:11:11,186 --> 00:11:14,087
I'll be on your ass every minute!

132
00:11:14,155 --> 00:11:20,160
I'll sit next to you during the day
and check your room at night.

133
00:11:20,228 --> 00:11:24,298
I even booked your seat on the plane
right next to mine.

134
00:11:24,365 --> 00:11:27,935
I didn't see you in class all year.

135
00:11:28,002 --> 00:11:30,137
That credit is not coming easy.

136
00:11:30,205 --> 00:11:34,607
We're going to make up for lost time starting now.

137
00:11:34,675 --> 00:11:38,645
Repetez. Je m'appelle Michael Corben.

138
00:11:38,713 --> 00:11:40,680
Class, follow me.

139
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:43,283
Repetez!

140
00:11:43,351 --> 00:11:44,517
Repetez.

141
00:11:44,585 --> 00:11:46,419
Je m'appelle Michael Corben.

142
00:11:46,487 --> 00:11:52,659
Phone call for Mr. Michael Corben
in the first-class lounge.

143
00:11:52,727 --> 00:11:54,661
Can that call be transferred?

144
00:11:54,729 --> 00:11:57,998
No, but the first-class lounge is around the corner.

145
00:11:58,066 --> 00:12:02,802
When you come back,
I'll have your ticket ready for you.

146
00:12:09,177 --> 00:12:12,179
Marie, I'm taking my break!

147
00:12:12,247 --> 00:12:13,613
Good morning.

148
00:12:13,681 --> 00:12:15,115
I'm Michael Corben.

149
00:12:15,183 --> 00:12:17,617
There's a telephone call for me.

150
00:12:17,685 --> 00:12:22,122
Sorry, we're closed for cleaning.
Our club room's down the hall.

151
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,623
It's important.

152
00:12:23,691 --> 00:12:27,094
If you can stand the noise, take it in there.

153
00:12:27,161 --> 00:12:28,595
Thank you.

154
00:12:35,703 --> 00:12:38,638
Michael, it's Mother.

155
00:12:41,175 --> 00:12:42,609
Hello, Mother.

156
00:12:42,676 --> 00:12:45,645
Honey, I can barely hear you.

157
00:12:45,713 --> 00:12:47,714
Repeat, please.

158
00:12:47,782 --> 00:12:53,153
Listen, Michael, pick up an extra bottle
of Chanel when you go shopping.

159
00:12:53,221 --> 00:12:55,455
Grandma will want one, too.

160
00:12:55,523 --> 00:12:58,125
Chanel... shopping...

161
00:12:58,192 --> 00:12:59,793
Grandma?

162
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:05,265
Right, and try to sleep on the plane.
You sound tense.

163
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:10,971
- I will.
- Bye, honey. I'll miss you, sweetheart.

164
00:13:28,756 --> 00:13:29,923
Uh!

165
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:34,261
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

166
00:13:34,329 --> 00:13:40,033
- Ah, yes, we have your ticket right here.
- You do? Well, what about...

167
00:13:40,101 --> 00:13:46,106
- Michael Corben. First-class.
- First-class?

168
00:13:46,174 --> 00:13:49,109
- Have a nice flight.
- Thanks.

169
00:13:49,177 --> 00:13:53,113
What's your seat number, Michael?
Maybe we can sit together.

170
00:13:53,181 --> 00:13:57,650
I really don't think that's possible,
unless you're traveling first-class.

171
00:13:57,718 --> 00:13:59,686
Right, like, I'm sure.

172
00:14:01,555 --> 00:14:03,056
What? How...

173
00:14:03,124 --> 00:14:04,591
Paging Michael Corben.

174
00:14:04,658 --> 00:14:07,560
Please report to the yellow courtesy phone.

175
00:14:07,628 --> 00:14:09,296
Excuse me.

176
00:14:10,631 --> 00:14:13,066
Hey, check it out.

177
00:14:13,134 --> 00:14:14,567
First-class.

178
00:14:17,138 --> 00:14:18,738
How?

179
00:14:18,806 --> 00:14:23,243
Ow! Did you really think
I would sit next to Grober?

180
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,048
There's been a mistake.

181
00:14:35,689 --> 00:14:38,658
Where are you going with that cart?

182
00:14:44,365 --> 00:14:46,466
This should be disposed of.

183
00:14:49,037 --> 00:14:51,405
Exactly.

184
00:14:51,472 --> 00:14:52,972
Paging Michael Corben.

185
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:55,642
Phone call for Mr. Michael Corben.

186
00:14:57,211 --> 00:14:58,611
It's for you.

187
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:00,847
Ha ha!

188
00:15:03,884 --> 00:15:05,085
Yeah?

189
00:15:05,153 --> 00:15:06,086
Corben?

190
00:15:06,154 --> 00:15:07,087
Yeah?

191
00:15:07,155 --> 00:15:08,422
It's Mother.

192
00:15:08,489 --> 00:15:10,190
Who is this?

193
00:15:10,258 --> 00:15:14,528
Listen. An operative
will be meeting you on the plane.

194
00:15:14,595 --> 00:15:16,596
I know who this is.

195
00:15:16,664 --> 00:15:22,069
If you guys are on a speakerphone,
tell your sister she has nice tits.

196
00:15:22,136 --> 00:15:25,072
Corben, we shan't do anything of the kind.

197
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:26,373
Who's that? Sanderson?

198
00:15:26,441 --> 00:15:27,441
Haywood.

199
00:15:27,508 --> 00:15:29,976
Haywood? Nice accent, mate.

200
00:15:30,044 --> 00:15:31,411
Thank you.

201
00:15:31,479 --> 00:15:35,549
Get this, guys, I'm traveling to Paris, first-class.

202
00:15:35,616 --> 00:15:39,986
We're with you in spirit.
Be careful. Good luck.

203
00:15:41,355 --> 00:15:42,322
Mother.

204
00:15:43,691 --> 00:15:47,961
We've got less than five minutes
to get on the plane.

205
00:15:48,028 --> 00:15:49,963
Let's go. Let's go!

206
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:52,199
We've got a plane to catch.

207
00:15:52,266 --> 00:15:55,635
Uh, hey. First-class.

208
00:15:55,703 --> 00:15:57,737
Right this way.

209
00:16:03,644 --> 00:16:05,845
Unreal.

210
00:16:05,913 --> 00:16:07,581
Champagne?

211
00:16:07,648 --> 00:16:09,082
Yeah!

212
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,283
Yeah.

213
00:16:14,489 --> 00:16:15,455
Ah!

214
00:16:20,661 --> 00:16:23,096
Pardon. Is everyone on the plane?

215
00:16:23,164 --> 00:16:25,132
How would I know?

216
00:16:34,008 --> 00:16:35,408
Bonjour, Monsieur.

217
00:16:40,515 --> 00:16:43,916
# Got the whole of the world in your fingers #

218
00:16:43,984 --> 00:16:46,119
# Got the whole of the world... #

219
00:16:46,187 --> 00:16:47,120
Thanks.

220
00:16:47,188 --> 00:16:48,555
# In your hands #

221
00:16:48,623 --> 00:16:52,091
# Got the whole of my world in your hands #

222
00:16:54,828 --> 00:16:58,898
# It's the same as they play it in the movies #

223
00:16:58,966 --> 00:17:02,469
# It's the same as you had on the ground now #

224
00:17:02,537 --> 00:17:04,070
# If you could be there #

225
00:17:04,138 --> 00:17:07,340
# Oh, you'd like to be there now #

226
00:17:07,408 --> 00:17:09,609
# Now, now, now #

227
00:17:09,677 --> 00:17:11,344
# Tell me, who do you love? #

228
00:17:11,412 --> 00:17:14,080
# Do you, who do you, do you love? #

229
00:17:14,148 --> 00:17:15,582
Oh!

230
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:17,917
Prime rib or lobster?

231
00:17:17,985 --> 00:17:20,587
#... Do you love, do you, who do you, do you love? #

232
00:17:20,655 --> 00:17:23,590
Excuse me. What is this?

233
00:17:23,658 --> 00:17:25,858
Food.

234
00:17:29,897 --> 00:17:32,799
I am looking for him.

235
00:17:32,866 --> 00:17:34,534
His name is Michael Corben.

236
00:17:34,602 --> 00:17:37,604
He's on a class trip. I'm his teacher.

237
00:17:37,672 --> 00:17:42,108
He should be in coach. I don't know why he's here.

238
00:17:48,683 --> 00:17:50,783
Are you Michael Corben?

239
00:17:50,851 --> 00:17:51,784
What?

240
00:17:51,852 --> 00:17:54,287
Are you Michael Corben?

241
00:17:59,727 --> 00:18:01,628
Oh. Yeah.

242
00:18:01,696 --> 00:18:04,130
Are you supposed to be here?

243
00:18:07,668 --> 00:18:09,001
Where's your ticket?

244
00:18:09,069 --> 00:18:10,103
Oh.

245
00:18:12,106 --> 00:18:13,240
Yes.

246
00:18:13,307 --> 00:18:18,345
Well, there's this woman,
she says she's your French teacher, Mrs. Grober.

247
00:18:18,412 --> 00:18:20,580
Not my French teacher!

248
00:18:20,648 --> 00:18:26,753
Listen, that woman's been on my tail
since she spotted me in Detroit.

249
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,221
You know what?

250
00:18:28,289 --> 00:18:35,295
I think she thinks she thinks she knows me,
but I don't think I know her.

251
00:18:35,363 --> 00:18:38,898
I think that sounds logical.
What do you think?

252
00:18:38,966 --> 00:18:41,568
Think of something to get rid of her.

253
00:18:41,636 --> 00:18:45,104
Tell her you can't think right now.

254
00:18:45,172 --> 00:18:46,606
Whoa!

255
00:18:48,175 --> 00:18:57,450
Listen, lady, I don't know what you're up to,
but stay away from Michael Corben,
or I'll splatter your brains all over this aircraft!

256
00:18:57,518 --> 00:18:58,851
You understand?

257
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:02,255
If you're wondering, I have the authority to do it.

258
00:19:08,095 --> 00:19:10,029
You've got to help me!

259
00:19:10,097 --> 00:19:13,065
A man with a gun and Michael Corben...

260
00:19:13,133 --> 00:19:14,734
Whoa!

261
00:19:18,138 --> 00:19:20,774
Get ahold of yourself.

262
00:19:22,142 --> 00:19:23,777
I'll be back!

263
00:19:37,124 --> 00:19:38,525
Ohhh...

264
00:19:49,136 --> 00:19:53,105
What are you doing? Go back to work.

265
00:20:03,617 --> 00:20:07,587
Great cover, Corben. Don't turn around.

266
00:20:07,655 --> 00:20:10,089
Don't worry. Everything is under control.

267
00:20:10,157 --> 00:20:13,059
You've got a safe ride to Paris.

268
00:20:13,126 --> 00:20:14,627
Good luck.

269
00:20:25,673 --> 00:20:30,142
- A nightcap, perhaps, sir?
- Why, thank you.

270
00:20:33,681 --> 00:20:35,815
Sweet dreams.

271
00:20:45,192 --> 00:20:46,693
Oh, oh, oh!

272
00:20:46,761 --> 00:20:51,063
The captain has turned on the "no smoking" sign
in preparation for our descent.

273
00:20:51,131 --> 00:20:52,131
Woo!

274
00:21:02,676 --> 00:21:04,076
Thanks.

275
00:21:04,144 --> 00:21:10,583
Listen, I travel first-class all over the world,
and that was the best Julius Caesar salad ever.

276
00:21:10,651 --> 00:21:12,552
It was my pleasure.

277
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,153
Michael! Michael Corben!

278
00:21:14,221 --> 00:21:16,956
I know what you've been up to!

279
00:21:17,024 --> 00:21:19,058
You are in big trouble, mister!

280
00:21:19,126 --> 00:21:20,427
Excuse me!

281
00:21:20,494 --> 00:21:22,194
Out of the way! Move!

282
00:21:22,262 --> 00:21:25,965
- You going to help me?
- I'll take care of her.

283
00:21:26,033 --> 00:21:27,634
Don't move!

284
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,404
Move these bags, you idiot!

285
00:21:31,472 --> 00:21:32,906
Excuse me!

286
00:21:32,973 --> 00:21:35,074
We have landed, sir.

287
00:21:35,142 --> 00:21:36,075
Sir?

288
00:21:36,143 --> 00:21:37,577
Wake up.

289
00:21:37,645 --> 00:21:39,579
Wake up!

290
00:21:40,648 --> 00:21:43,249
Aah!

291
00:21:43,317 --> 00:21:46,085
# Whoa, whoa #

292
00:21:46,153 --> 00:21:49,088
# I'm gettin' that feelin' again #

293
00:21:49,156 --> 00:21:52,625
# Whoa, whoa #

294
00:21:52,693 --> 00:21:54,126
# I'm gettin'... #

295
00:21:54,194 --> 00:21:56,162
Michael Corben!

296
00:21:56,229 --> 00:21:57,564
Michael!

297
00:21:57,631 --> 00:22:00,099
Michael Corben, you come back here!

298
00:22:00,167 --> 00:22:02,134
Hurry. They know you're here.

299
00:22:02,202 --> 00:22:03,870
Derek Richardson, British Intelligence.

300
00:22:03,938 --> 00:22:06,272
Somebody gave me that first-class ticket.

301
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,074
Michael Corben, come back here!

302
00:22:08,141 --> 00:22:10,477
I didn't even eat dinner!

303
00:22:12,412 --> 00:22:13,412
Aah!

304
00:22:13,481 --> 00:22:14,714
Oh!

305
00:22:14,782 --> 00:22:19,418
All right, I had the lobster!
I did drink the champagne.

306
00:22:19,487 --> 00:22:21,488
They're already on to us!

307
00:22:21,555 --> 00:22:23,556
I fell asleep during the movie!

308
00:22:23,624 --> 00:22:24,991
Wow!

309
00:22:26,326 --> 00:22:28,094
There must be...

310
00:22:28,161 --> 00:22:30,096
Listen, what are you doing?

311
00:22:30,163 --> 00:22:31,598
Get inside!

312
00:22:31,665 --> 00:22:32,599
Go!

313
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:34,634
Go? Go where?

314
00:22:42,275 --> 00:22:43,442
Zigesfeld!

315
00:22:45,112 --> 00:22:47,680
It's me.

316
00:22:47,748 --> 00:22:50,282
Listen, our informant duped us.

317
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:58,090
Not only is Michael Corben still alive,
but he's working with an American woman
they call "the French Teacher."

318
00:22:58,158 --> 00:22:59,158
There!

319
00:22:59,226 --> 00:23:01,628
Michael! Michael!

320
00:23:03,631 --> 00:23:05,364
No!

321
00:23:05,432 --> 00:23:08,134
I'll take care of her. Follow Corben.

322
00:23:08,201 --> 00:23:09,569
Kill him.

323
00:23:09,637 --> 00:23:12,939
There can be no more mistakes.

324
00:23:22,115 --> 00:23:23,616
Michael!

325
00:23:28,155 --> 00:23:29,556
Nasty business!

326
00:23:29,623 --> 00:23:31,558
I wonder how it happened.

327
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:34,060
The ticket had my name on it.

328
00:23:34,127 --> 00:23:36,095
I didn't want to sit there.

329
00:23:36,163 --> 00:23:37,897
What else could you do?

330
00:23:37,965 --> 00:23:38,898
Nothing.

331
00:23:38,966 --> 00:23:40,934
You're lucky to be alive.

332
00:23:41,001 --> 00:23:43,870
In Spain, with their security, they'd have killed you.

333
00:23:49,677 --> 00:23:53,613
Listen, I'm an American citizen, and I know my rights.

334
00:23:53,681 --> 00:23:56,616
Corben, don't go asking for special privileges.

335
00:23:56,684 --> 00:23:59,586
I want to speak to the American Embassy.

336
00:23:59,653 --> 00:24:01,621
- Relax. They know you're here.
- What'd they say?

337
00:24:01,689 --> 00:24:03,590
They wished you good luck.

338
00:24:12,633 --> 00:24:14,567
What the hell is that?

339
00:24:14,635 --> 00:24:18,671
Our new bomb scanner,
almost 90% effective.

340
00:24:21,642 --> 00:24:23,076
Come along.

341
00:24:23,143 --> 00:24:24,577
This way.

342
00:24:31,652 --> 00:24:34,553
Ha ha ha! Oh, I love this place.

343
00:24:38,659 --> 00:24:40,093
Stand back, gentlemen.

344
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,162
Well, we'd better stand here for now.

345
00:24:50,638 --> 00:24:51,570
Uh!

346
00:24:51,639 --> 00:24:53,572
Isn't it marvelous?

347
00:24:53,641 --> 00:24:55,241
Ready to go again?

348
00:24:55,308 --> 00:24:58,011
Maybe later.

349
00:24:58,078 --> 00:25:00,412
Hello, Ian. Sorry to interrupt.

350
00:25:01,782 --> 00:25:03,249
Excuse me.

351
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:07,253
Ha ha! Very good!

352
00:25:18,132 --> 00:25:22,068
Michael Corben, allow me to introduce
Miss Galante.

353
00:25:22,136 --> 00:25:24,336
So, you're Corben.

354
00:25:24,404 --> 00:25:25,604
Uh-huh.

355
00:25:27,141 --> 00:25:29,542
We expected a much older man.

356
00:25:29,609 --> 00:25:33,746
Interesting. Very interesting.

357
00:25:33,814 --> 00:25:34,981
Your equipment.

358
00:25:35,049 --> 00:25:36,983
How old are you, Corben?

359
00:25:37,051 --> 00:25:40,753
I don't have to answer any of these questions.

360
00:25:40,821 --> 00:25:44,724
Relax, Mr. Corben. We'll respect your cover.

361
00:25:44,792 --> 00:25:47,226
We prepared for someone more conservative.

362
00:25:47,294 --> 00:25:49,962
These won't do at all now.

363
00:25:51,231 --> 00:25:55,234
The French Police forwarded your call
to their English-Speaking Bureau.

364
00:25:55,302 --> 00:25:56,602
Oh, thank goodness!

365
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:58,938
We are fully apprised of the situation.

366
00:25:59,006 --> 00:26:03,776
It will be best if you just forgot
whatever you thought you saw.

367
00:26:03,844 --> 00:26:06,245
How can I? We're talking about Michael Corben!

368
00:26:06,313 --> 00:26:11,050
Are you sure you're completely aware
of the full import of this situation?

369
00:26:11,118 --> 00:26:13,886
Of course. I am the French Teacher!

370
00:26:13,954 --> 00:26:15,755
I'll kill that kid.

371
00:26:15,823 --> 00:26:19,558
- Keep her talking.
- Oh, that won't be a problem.

372
00:26:19,626 --> 00:26:24,063
I want all references
to the operative called "the French Teacher."

373
00:26:24,131 --> 00:26:27,100
Go back 20 years if necessary.

374
00:26:27,167 --> 00:26:29,769
Corben will have to go it alone.

375
00:26:29,837 --> 00:26:32,304
Then somebody must call his mother!

376
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,044
Mrs. Grober, do you know Mother?

377
00:26:38,112 --> 00:26:40,213
I certainly do.

378
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:45,584
Shh! Despite what you are saying,
if I don't have Michael Corben this week,

379
00:26:45,652 --> 00:26:47,920
she will be one unhappy lady.

380
00:26:47,988 --> 00:26:49,688
Is that a threat?

381
00:26:49,757 --> 00:26:52,058
French teachers do not threaten, Monsieur.

382
00:26:52,126 --> 00:26:54,794
They say s'il vous plait.

383
00:27:06,106 --> 00:27:11,010
My people have adjusted the armament provision
designated for your mission, Corben.

384
00:27:11,078 --> 00:27:15,782
- My what?
- Surely you're familiar with the knapsack.

385
00:27:15,849 --> 00:27:17,817
I'm sure you'll find these interesting.

386
00:27:17,885 --> 00:27:22,054
You'll be the first agent to use the working prototype.

387
00:27:22,122 --> 00:27:27,326
No way. X-ray specs?

388
00:27:29,096 --> 00:27:32,098
Of course, x-rays are impervious to lead.

389
00:27:34,101 --> 00:27:35,501
Of course.

390
00:27:35,568 --> 00:27:37,103
May I?

391
00:27:44,244 --> 00:27:46,245
You're such a boy, Derek.

392
00:27:48,916 --> 00:27:50,749
My, my!

393
00:27:52,152 --> 00:27:56,989
Chewable plastic explosives. Sugarless, of course.

394
00:27:57,057 --> 00:27:59,091
Quite ingenious.

395
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:02,094
Simply chew like an ordinary piece of gum.

396
00:28:02,162 --> 00:28:06,365
Combine with the silver foil
to activate the explosive compound.

397
00:28:11,872 --> 00:28:14,073
These are quite new.

398
00:28:17,277 --> 00:28:19,578
Press these pads to activate.

399
00:28:21,681 --> 00:28:24,083
They'll adhere to any surface.

400
00:28:26,954 --> 00:28:30,789
NASA technology combined with British ingenuity.

401
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:37,063
I wouldn't gain any weight if I were you.

402
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:38,530
Ha ha ha!

403
00:28:38,598 --> 00:28:43,569
This is all very cool,
but you guys are making a big mistake.

404
00:28:43,636 --> 00:28:45,704
Isn't this charade getting tiresome?

405
00:28:45,772 --> 00:28:49,075
Just who do you think I am?

406
00:28:49,142 --> 00:28:52,078
Michael Corben, deep-cover agent for the CIA.

407
00:28:52,145 --> 00:28:54,713
Michael Corben, French-class reject.

408
00:28:54,781 --> 00:28:56,582
I've seen it before.

409
00:28:56,649 --> 00:29:01,587
They've got them so brainwashed in America,
you can't penetrate his cover.

410
00:29:01,654 --> 00:29:03,522
Here, look. Check this out.

411
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:07,293
Here's my driver's license,
my school i.d., my fake i.d.

412
00:29:07,361 --> 00:29:10,629
Track down Mrs. Grober, my French teacher.

413
00:29:10,697 --> 00:29:14,566
- She'll tell you I'm...
- Your car.

414
00:29:15,702 --> 00:29:19,738
Michael Corben, deep-cover operative for the CIA.

415
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:28,247
This is a photograph of Augustus Steranko,
Orenbourg's Chancellor of Finance.

416
00:29:28,315 --> 00:29:30,950
Steranko is an ally and a friend.

417
00:29:31,018 --> 00:29:33,386
I got to get a boat.

418
00:29:33,453 --> 00:29:37,890
Steranko will be hosting a summit
at the Chateau Richlieu in Orenbourg.

419
00:29:37,958 --> 00:29:39,358
This is cool.

420
00:29:39,426 --> 00:29:44,397
Prime ministers from every Common-Market
nation will bring their countries' gold.

421
00:29:44,464 --> 00:29:47,900
The Chateau will become the Fort Knox of Europe.

422
00:29:47,968 --> 00:29:51,770
When you say, "your car,"
did you mean "your car,"

423
00:29:51,838 --> 00:29:55,874
or did you mean "your car," as in my car?

424
00:29:55,943 --> 00:30:02,214
The assassin has already murdered three Finance
Ministers and Blade, who was our own top agent.

425
00:30:02,282 --> 00:30:05,484
We suspect Steranko will be his next target.

426
00:30:05,552 --> 00:30:10,756
Under no circumstances should you indicate to him
that you're working for British Intelligence.

427
00:30:10,824 --> 00:30:15,294
- Control panel open.
- Get out of town.

428
00:30:15,362 --> 00:30:16,795
Damn!

429
00:30:16,863 --> 00:30:18,431
Now...

430
00:30:18,498 --> 00:30:24,870
in here, you'll find a wet suit,
scuba gear, camouflage, and a tuxedo,

431
00:30:24,938 --> 00:30:28,507
all outfitted with standard
hands-up survival protection.

432
00:30:28,575 --> 00:30:31,577
There's a map in your glove compartment.

433
00:30:31,644 --> 00:30:39,585
You'll find 100,000 francs for expenses in your pack,
along with the key to your room at the Palace Hotel.

434
00:30:39,652 --> 00:30:44,423
It's near the casino where
Steranko will be playing cards tonight.

435
00:30:44,491 --> 00:30:48,927
Buy whatever you need--some new clothes,
perhaps--but save the receipts.

436
00:30:48,996 --> 00:30:52,631
Uh... you won't need this. I'll keep it for you.

437
00:30:52,699 --> 00:30:59,638
Ok, so basically, you want me to blaze down to
Orenbourg, hang out for a while, right?

438
00:30:59,706 --> 00:31:02,574
And keep an eye on this Steranko guy.

439
00:31:02,642 --> 00:31:04,076
More or less.

440
00:31:04,144 --> 00:31:06,045
Uh-huh. In this car?

441
00:31:06,113 --> 00:31:09,581
- Good luck.
- Yes, godspeed.

442
00:31:09,649 --> 00:31:11,083
Uh-huh.

443
00:31:11,151 --> 00:31:12,784
So...

444
00:31:14,654 --> 00:31:22,495
I can drive this baby out of here right now,
right, without you guys?

445
00:31:22,562 --> 00:31:26,665
Um... yes.

446
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:44,950
# This is not what I remember #

447
00:31:45,018 --> 00:31:48,287
# It's nothing like the same #

448
00:31:48,355 --> 00:31:50,789
# You know that girls are like fire #

449
00:31:50,857 --> 00:31:53,159
# Boys are not to blame #

450
00:31:55,962 --> 00:31:59,765
# This is not the 1930s #

451
00:31:59,832 --> 00:32:02,201
# It's not a TV show #

452
00:32:03,437 --> 00:32:05,704
# You know that I just want to dance #

453
00:32:05,772 --> 00:32:07,673
# I just want to dance #

454
00:32:14,481 --> 00:32:15,948
Back off!

455
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:18,750
Pull over!

456
00:32:18,818 --> 00:32:20,119
One second.

457
00:32:20,187 --> 00:32:22,788
Let me get the window down.

458
00:32:22,855 --> 00:32:25,057
# One hot country #

459
00:32:25,125 --> 00:32:26,258
Windows.

460
00:32:26,326 --> 00:32:28,360
Control panel open.

461
00:32:28,428 --> 00:32:30,563
All systems ready.

462
00:32:34,667 --> 00:32:36,735
What's your name?

463
00:32:36,803 --> 00:32:37,903
Jeez!

464
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,341
Oh, my god!

465
00:32:42,409 --> 00:32:45,444
You're in danger. Behind you!

466
00:32:46,613 --> 00:32:47,613
Hey!

467
00:32:50,517 --> 00:32:52,318
What's your problem?

468
00:32:55,322 --> 00:32:58,524
Front, rear rockets armed.

469
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:01,793
Shield.

470
00:33:03,763 --> 00:33:05,531
Parachute deployed.

471
00:33:18,278 --> 00:33:20,879
# One hot country #

472
00:33:20,947 --> 00:33:22,014
# This is just #

473
00:33:22,081 --> 00:33:24,783
# One hot country #

474
00:33:24,851 --> 00:33:26,018
# This is just #

475
00:33:26,085 --> 00:33:27,052
# One hot country #

476
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,622
You smashed into my car!

477
00:33:32,526 --> 00:33:34,059
Jesus!

478
00:33:34,127 --> 00:33:36,895
# One hot country... #

479
00:33:36,963 --> 00:33:39,298
Listen to me. Back off!

480
00:33:48,375 --> 00:33:49,708
Front rockets...

481
00:33:51,811 --> 00:33:54,180
rocket armed.

482
00:33:54,247 --> 00:33:55,247
Windows.

483
00:33:55,315 --> 00:33:57,049
Put the windows down.

484
00:33:57,116 --> 00:33:58,651
Systems overload. Fire.

485
00:34:17,671 --> 00:34:20,272
# One hot country #

486
00:34:21,808 --> 00:34:25,678
# One hot country #

487
00:34:25,745 --> 00:34:31,383
- Look at that babe!
- Kent, stop looking at babes!

488
00:34:31,451 --> 00:34:33,319
Oh, my god!

489
00:34:33,386 --> 00:34:35,221
It's Michael Corben!

490
00:34:35,288 --> 00:34:36,822
It's Michael!

491
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:38,424
Michael!

492
00:34:40,893 --> 00:34:42,361
Where?

493
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:45,197
# This is just one hot country #

494
00:34:45,265 --> 00:34:47,466
Rear rockets. Fasten seat belt.

495
00:34:47,534 --> 00:34:50,001
# One hot country #

496
00:34:50,069 --> 00:34:51,870
Disarmed. Armed.

497
00:34:51,938 --> 00:34:53,239
Fire.

498
00:34:56,843 --> 00:34:58,143
Whoa!

499
00:35:10,423 --> 00:35:12,824
# Whoa oh oh #

500
00:35:12,892 --> 00:35:15,461
# Oh oh oh oh #

501
00:35:18,431 --> 00:35:19,931
Disable vehicle.

502
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,434
Shit!

503
00:35:26,139 --> 00:35:27,939
Windows down.

504
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:38,950
You...

505
00:35:43,956 --> 00:35:49,060
Ah, man! Those British guys
are really going to be honked off.

506
00:36:02,275 --> 00:36:04,576
You are so gross.

507
00:36:09,115 --> 00:36:10,516
Oh!

508
00:36:10,583 --> 00:36:12,050
Oh, god!

509
00:36:12,118 --> 00:36:13,485
Oh!

510
00:36:30,136 --> 00:36:33,071
Back in the bus five minutes exactly.

511
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,154
Bonjour.

512
00:36:49,222 --> 00:36:52,257
Je suis le nouveau chauffeur, Jean-Claude.

513
00:36:52,325 --> 00:36:57,896
Ah, um... Class...
Bonjour, Jean-Claude.

514
00:37:05,772 --> 00:37:08,407
Augustus!

515
00:37:13,112 --> 00:37:16,582
Augustus!

516
00:37:23,289 --> 00:37:25,190
The German Finance Minister's here!

517
00:37:25,258 --> 00:37:29,728
He was here two days ago with the other Finance Ministers.

518
00:37:29,796 --> 00:37:31,730
They seemed perfectly satisfied.

519
00:37:31,798 --> 00:37:33,932
No. He suspects.

520
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,868
Show him to the library.

521
00:37:35,935 --> 00:37:39,571
A few well-chosen words, and he'll be gone.

522
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:43,275
Steranko! Get out of my way!

523
00:37:49,148 --> 00:37:51,082
You let him in here.

524
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:53,084
He let himself in here.

525
00:37:53,152 --> 00:37:54,553
Talking is useless.

526
00:37:54,621 --> 00:37:56,087
Oh, Krupp.

527
00:37:56,155 --> 00:37:58,089
What a pleasant surprise.

528
00:37:58,157 --> 00:38:02,127
This is insanity. What have you done with our gold?

529
00:38:02,194 --> 00:38:06,331
Yes, Augustus, show him.

530
00:38:06,399 --> 00:38:10,402
Your gold is lowered into the smelting cauldron.

531
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:13,539
All impurities are vaporized.

532
00:38:13,606 --> 00:38:15,874
Germany will never stand for this.

533
00:38:15,942 --> 00:38:19,978
The bullion is rehardened with liquid nitrogen

534
00:38:20,046 --> 00:38:22,581
before it's sent to the presses

535
00:38:22,649 --> 00:38:25,717
to mint the new coin of my empire.

536
00:38:25,785 --> 00:38:27,953
You're mad.

537
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,555
What?

538
00:38:29,622 --> 00:38:31,623
I'll tell the world.

539
00:38:31,691 --> 00:38:34,626
I don't think so.

540
00:38:34,694 --> 00:38:36,094
No!

541
00:38:37,296 --> 00:38:38,664
Take him.

542
00:38:38,731 --> 00:38:39,731
No!

543
00:38:39,799 --> 00:38:45,036
You can't do this! Stop it!
Stop it! Let me go!

544
00:38:45,104 --> 00:38:46,638
Ooh!

545
00:38:46,706 --> 00:38:52,511
Don't you ever countermand me again.
Do you hear?

546
00:38:55,147 --> 00:38:59,084
Yes, of course, Augustus.
I just thought that I...

547
00:38:59,151 --> 00:39:02,053
Please! Don't think.

548
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,368
Hey, wait up!

549
00:39:16,435 --> 00:39:18,303
Hey!

550
00:39:24,944 --> 00:39:26,344
How's it going?

551
00:39:26,412 --> 00:39:27,880
Bonsoir.

552
00:39:27,947 --> 00:39:30,315
Leave the windows down.

553
00:39:30,383 --> 00:39:32,384
Ou allez-vous, Monsieur?

554
00:39:32,451 --> 00:39:35,754
Listen, it is very important. I must entrez.

555
00:39:35,822 --> 00:39:39,057
I must find zat girl.

556
00:39:43,429 --> 00:39:45,063
No, not French.

557
00:39:45,131 --> 00:39:47,766
Parlez-vous English?

558
00:39:47,834 --> 00:39:55,807
Monsieur, what I said is that you look like
a piece of adolescent American dog shit.

559
00:39:55,875 --> 00:39:59,511
- Dog shit.
- Change your clothes.

560
00:40:12,158 --> 00:40:14,092
# Ooh ooh ooh #

561
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,127
# Ooh ooh ooh ooh #

562
00:40:26,439 --> 00:40:28,106
 # I buy you flowers #

563
00:40:28,174 --> 00:40:30,275
# And I buy you rings #

564
00:40:30,342 --> 00:40:34,012
# My credit's for you and your million-dollar things #

565
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,081
# I take you dancing #

566
00:40:36,148 --> 00:40:37,783
# I take you out #

567
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:40,251
# Everything is all for you #

568
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:42,588
# You're what I'm all about #

569
00:40:42,655 --> 00:40:44,957
# You might think I'm crazy #

570
00:40:45,024 --> 00:40:47,492
# But I don't give a damn #

571
00:40:48,695 --> 00:40:51,162
Hi. You probably don't remember me.

572
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:54,132
Red Lotus, 150 miles per hour.

573
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,102
You ran me off the road twice.

574
00:40:57,169 --> 00:40:58,637
Go away.

575
00:40:58,705 --> 00:41:01,740
Ah, 21! I kill at this game.

576
00:41:01,808 --> 00:41:06,144
The game is Baccarat, Monsieur.
Observers are not permitted.

577
00:41:06,212 --> 00:41:09,014
I suspect this game will end shortly.

578
00:41:09,082 --> 00:41:10,949
You wish.

579
00:41:14,854 --> 00:41:16,421
Oh!

580
00:41:16,489 --> 00:41:19,958
- What's that mean?
- I'm out of the game.

581
00:41:26,465 --> 00:41:28,466
Ah, chips for, uh...

582
00:41:30,637 --> 00:41:31,803
Mariska.

583
00:41:33,139 --> 00:41:34,439
Mariska.

584
00:41:34,507 --> 00:41:35,907
Chip us.

585
00:41:35,975 --> 00:41:39,544
I'm sorry.
Baccarat is not played in doubles.

586
00:41:39,612 --> 00:41:41,146
I don't mind.

587
00:41:41,213 --> 00:41:46,652
You can bring all Europe to the table
as far as I'm concerned.

588
00:41:49,622 --> 00:41:51,823
Knock the shit out of him.

589
00:41:55,161 --> 00:41:56,795
Hey.

590
00:41:56,863 --> 00:41:58,630
Banco...

591
00:41:58,698 --> 00:42:00,165
50,000.

592
00:42:00,232 --> 00:42:02,134
Banco.

593
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:06,872
Banco... what's that?

594
00:42:06,939 --> 00:42:10,608
You just bet half your money.

595
00:42:14,113 --> 00:42:15,947
It's no problem.

596
00:42:17,316 --> 00:42:25,190
So, listen, when I saw you in the car,
I just wanted to find out your name.

597
00:42:25,257 --> 00:42:27,059
Mariska.

598
00:42:27,126 --> 00:42:30,729
It's almost as beautiful as...

599
00:42:32,298 --> 00:42:34,166
as you are.

600
00:42:34,233 --> 00:42:37,035
Is Monsieur still in the game?

601
00:42:37,103 --> 00:42:43,474
Chill out. I'm talking to a lady.

602
00:42:43,542 --> 00:42:45,276
Ahem!

603
00:42:48,781 --> 00:42:50,648
Blackjack!

604
00:42:50,717 --> 00:42:53,418
Do we win, or what?

605
00:42:53,485 --> 00:42:58,590
Face cards are worth zero.
We need an 8 to win.

606
00:42:58,657 --> 00:43:00,092
An 8?

607
00:43:00,159 --> 00:43:03,729
Perhaps you would care to increase the stakes.

608
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:12,738
- But, Monsieur, this is highly irregular.
- I make the rules.

609
00:43:15,441 --> 00:43:21,179
Well, I can't see a thing without my glasses.

610
00:43:24,083 --> 00:43:25,183
Wow!

611
00:43:29,321 --> 00:43:30,722
Hey!

612
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:33,125
Monsieur, your bet.

613
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,402
Young man, perhaps you don't fully understand the stakes.

614
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:47,072
I wouldn't want you to get...

615
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:49,007
hurt.

616
00:43:53,445 --> 00:43:56,414
It's cool. Hit me.

617
00:44:07,226 --> 00:44:09,127
We won.

618
00:44:09,195 --> 00:44:11,029
We won? We did?

619
00:44:11,097 --> 00:44:12,831
We won.

620
00:44:16,769 --> 00:44:23,641
- You play well, Mister...
- Corben. Michael Corben.

621
00:44:27,079 --> 00:44:32,017
- And... you are?
- Steranko.

622
00:44:32,084 --> 00:44:34,986
Augustus Steranko.

623
00:44:36,455 --> 00:44:38,123
Oh, sorry, sir.

624
00:44:38,191 --> 00:44:42,928
Sir, I didn't mean to kick the sh... um...

625
00:44:42,995 --> 00:44:47,699
I can't believe this. Uh...
better than the lottery.

626
00:44:47,766 --> 00:44:51,336
They should give you a bag for this stuff.

627
00:44:51,403 --> 00:44:53,171
Your room key.

628
00:44:53,239 --> 00:44:57,275
Thank you. Thanks.

629
00:44:58,811 --> 00:45:04,049
There have been too many mistakes.
Bring him to me.

630
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:17,395
These fools are no match for him.

631
00:45:20,099 --> 00:45:22,067
Areola, my darling.

632
00:45:26,105 --> 00:45:28,106
Hey, wait up!

633
00:45:30,509 --> 00:45:33,644
Monsieur, Monsieur, Monsieur!

634
00:45:40,086 --> 00:45:41,552
Turn around.

635
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:42,587
What?

636
00:45:43,856 --> 00:45:45,924
Put up your hands.

637
00:45:48,594 --> 00:45:50,428
What was that?

638
00:45:50,496 --> 00:45:52,063
Oh...

639
00:45:52,131 --> 00:45:54,065
Jesus...

640
00:45:54,133 --> 00:45:56,601
Monsieur!

641
00:45:56,668 --> 00:45:58,069
Monsieur!

642
00:45:59,638 --> 00:46:00,671
What?

643
00:46:00,739 --> 00:46:02,440
What have you done?

644
00:46:02,508 --> 00:46:04,376
I just went like this.

645
00:46:04,443 --> 00:46:06,211
Ah!

646
00:46:20,893 --> 00:46:24,062
Zigesfeld, take me to Ilsa.

647
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:37,375
I have the French Teacher and the mercenaries.

648
00:46:37,443 --> 00:46:39,344
I am awaiting further instructions.

649
00:46:39,412 --> 00:46:41,512
Kill them.

650
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:43,415
With pleasure.

651
00:46:54,626 --> 00:46:56,061
Monsieur!

652
00:47:00,366 --> 00:47:02,567
Ah. Bon.

653
00:47:09,775 --> 00:47:10,741
Uh!

654
00:47:16,048 --> 00:47:20,085
Bonsoir. I am Pierre, your new driver.

655
00:47:20,152 --> 00:47:24,089
Class... bonsoir, Pierre.

656
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:29,995
Corben is alive.

657
00:47:30,062 --> 00:47:33,031
There was no way to have known.

658
00:47:33,099 --> 00:47:39,004
The Americans sent two agents to the airport,
both by the name of Michael Corben.

659
00:47:39,071 --> 00:47:41,039
We killed the wrong one.

660
00:47:41,107 --> 00:47:43,041
Don't underestimate the Americans.

661
00:47:43,109 --> 00:47:46,011
We're not dealing with a common British agent.

662
00:47:46,078 --> 00:47:51,582
Michael Corben is a new breed...
unorthodox, unpredictable, fascinating.

663
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:55,053
We can't deal with him in our usual manner.

664
00:47:55,121 --> 00:47:59,524
However disagreeable,
we must sink to his level.

665
00:47:59,591 --> 00:48:02,060
What did you have in mind?

666
00:48:02,128 --> 00:48:03,995
Every man has his weakness.

667
00:48:04,063 --> 00:48:12,003
Where bullets may miss their mark,
the talents of a beautiful woman may strike
with fatal precision.

668
00:48:12,071 --> 00:48:15,806
You sent your slut.

669
00:48:15,874 --> 00:48:21,046
Miss Canasta is a specialist,
much like yourself.

670
00:48:25,584 --> 00:48:31,789
Corben is with Areola at the Palace Hotel.
Kill them both.

671
00:48:37,596 --> 00:48:39,030
Ah, Corben.

672
00:48:39,098 --> 00:48:41,032
I want out, Richardson.

673
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:44,536
That tux is real cute with the B.O. blasters.

674
00:48:44,603 --> 00:48:47,038
Gassed three people, probably killed them.

675
00:48:47,106 --> 00:48:51,376
No such luck.
They'll just wake up with a headache.

676
00:48:51,444 --> 00:48:54,212
This isn't my idea of a good time.

677
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,181
What were you expecting, Corben?

678
00:48:56,248 --> 00:49:02,620
To be cramped into a cheap hotel room
holding a farting contest with my roommates.

679
00:49:02,688 --> 00:49:07,225
This mission is more important
than sitting in a hotel room breaking wind.

680
00:49:07,293 --> 00:49:09,160
No. Surviving is more important.

681
00:49:09,228 --> 00:49:11,629
Good news about the French Teacher.

682
00:49:11,697 --> 00:49:20,505
Our sources pegged her as a second-rate
double agent from the cold war days,
who the CIA left for dead.

683
00:49:20,573 --> 00:49:25,143
She's on somebody's payroll
and traveling with a group of mercenaries.

684
00:49:25,211 --> 00:49:28,179
As you suspected, she knows who you are.

685
00:49:28,247 --> 00:49:30,181
Grober and those geeks, mercenaries?

686
00:49:30,249 --> 00:49:34,486
You guys should seriously think
about dropping the word "intelligence."

687
00:49:34,553 --> 00:49:41,159
Not to worry. Our man Kelly will dispose of them all
before they become a nuisance to you.

688
00:49:41,227 --> 00:49:45,696
- Wait a minute. You guys are serious.
- Quite.

689
00:49:45,764 --> 00:49:49,700
Richardson, why don't you hold them there for me?

690
00:49:49,768 --> 00:49:51,336
I'll handle it.

691
00:49:51,403 --> 00:49:55,840
I like a man who clears up his own mess.

692
00:50:09,721 --> 00:50:11,523
Oh!

693
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:13,625
Bonsoir, Monsieur Corben.

694
00:50:13,692 --> 00:50:16,827
Uh, boner... I mean, soir.

695
00:50:16,895 --> 00:50:21,132
I bribed the bell boy.
I hope you do not mind.

696
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,335
Mind? Like you think I'd mind?

697
00:50:24,403 --> 00:50:28,373
I neglected to tell you my name in the casino.

698
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:35,446
I am Areola. Areola Canasta.

699
00:50:35,514 --> 00:50:45,089
I do not give myself to just any man,
but you, Monsieur Corben, you intrigue me.

700
00:50:45,157 --> 00:50:48,593
Yeah? What about that Steranko guy?

701
00:50:48,661 --> 00:50:50,928
Is he, like, your boyfriend?

702
00:50:50,996 --> 00:50:55,300
No. I just met him tonight in the casino.

703
00:50:57,670 --> 00:51:00,305
So, um... what happened?

704
00:51:00,372 --> 00:51:08,646
He lost, and I like... winners.

705
00:51:14,253 --> 00:51:19,224
If you're willing to learn,
I can teach you many things.

706
00:51:19,291 --> 00:51:20,191
Ok.

707
00:51:20,259 --> 00:51:21,292
Mmm.

708
00:51:22,695 --> 00:51:24,262
Mmm.

709
00:51:25,764 --> 00:51:27,498
Mmm!

710
00:51:32,605 --> 00:51:34,038
Close your eyes.

711
00:51:34,106 --> 00:51:36,807
Shh.

712
00:51:39,945 --> 00:51:41,279
Mmm!

713
00:51:43,815 --> 00:51:44,849
Oh!

714
00:51:55,461 --> 00:51:57,061
Mmm.

715
00:51:57,129 --> 00:51:59,163
Mmm.

716
00:52:02,234 --> 00:52:04,502
Hey, that tickles.

717
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:07,338
Ha ha ha ha!

718
00:52:07,406 --> 00:52:09,173
Ha ha ha ha!

719
00:52:09,241 --> 00:52:11,075
Mmm.

720
00:52:13,579 --> 00:52:18,716
You see, my sweet,
your night has only begun to get hard.

721
00:52:18,784 --> 00:52:20,551
Interesting phrasing.

722
00:52:20,619 --> 00:52:27,091
Shh! The best part of the lesson
is learning how to accept pleasure.

723
00:52:30,796 --> 00:52:32,297
Ha ha ha!

724
00:52:32,364 --> 00:52:34,432
I'll be right back.

725
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:35,700
Ah!

726
00:52:38,103 --> 00:52:39,837
Here, boy!

727
00:52:39,905 --> 00:52:42,473
I'll be right there!

728
00:52:42,541 --> 00:52:44,074
Where are you?

729
00:52:44,142 --> 00:52:49,414
Uh... "combat condoms."

730
00:52:53,051 --> 00:52:54,786
Come here!

731
00:52:54,853 --> 00:52:56,554
Where are you?

732
00:52:58,256 --> 00:53:00,391
Aah!

733
00:53:00,459 --> 00:53:01,926
Ah!

734
00:53:03,895 --> 00:53:04,995
Oh!

735
00:53:05,063 --> 00:53:07,832
Ohh... oh!

736
00:53:07,899 --> 00:53:09,500
Just a minute.

737
00:53:09,568 --> 00:53:10,868
Ah!

738
00:53:10,936 --> 00:53:12,169
Ah!

739
00:53:12,237 --> 00:53:14,238
I'll be right there.

740
00:53:15,273 --> 00:53:16,541
Oh!

741
00:53:16,608 --> 00:53:18,042
Oh!

742
00:53:18,109 --> 00:53:19,811
Oh! Oh! Oh!

743
00:53:36,962 --> 00:53:38,229
Oh!

744
00:53:38,296 --> 00:53:39,230
Ah!

745
00:53:39,297 --> 00:53:40,865
Oh!

746
00:53:43,502 --> 00:53:44,469
Ooh!

747
00:53:44,536 --> 00:53:45,470
Oh!

748
00:53:45,537 --> 00:53:47,705
Oh! Oh!

749
00:53:47,773 --> 00:53:49,474
Oh! Oh! Oh!

750
00:53:56,648 --> 00:53:58,583
Oh! Oh, my god!

751
00:53:58,650 --> 00:53:59,984
Oh!

752
00:54:00,051 --> 00:54:01,419
Ah! Oh!

753
00:54:01,487 --> 00:54:03,788
Aah! Oh!

754
00:54:05,591 --> 00:54:08,025
Ohh! Ohh!

755
00:54:08,093 --> 00:54:10,828
Ohhh!

756
00:54:10,896 --> 00:54:12,897
Ohhh!

757
00:54:14,767 --> 00:54:15,867
Shit!

758
00:54:15,934 --> 00:54:17,034
Ohhh!

759
00:54:17,102 --> 00:54:18,736
Ahhh!

760
00:54:28,647 --> 00:54:29,980
Ah!

761
00:55:00,679 --> 00:55:02,112
Ah! Aah!

762
00:55:05,050 --> 00:55:07,552
That's it. I'm out of here.

763
00:55:18,597 --> 00:55:20,531
Excuse me! Coming through.

764
00:55:20,599 --> 00:55:21,999
Watch it!

765
00:55:22,067 --> 00:55:23,568
Excuse me!

766
00:55:43,121 --> 00:55:46,123
Oh, no. Not you, too.

767
00:55:59,972 --> 00:56:04,041
# And it don't work that way, no #

768
00:56:04,109 --> 00:56:08,379
# I can't imagine that could be #

769
00:56:08,446 --> 00:56:12,049
# It never crossed my mind #

770
00:56:12,117 --> 00:56:16,988
# Could be why I'm lonely time to time... #

771
00:56:23,261 --> 00:56:26,631
# Only you can reach me now... #

772
00:56:30,168 --> 00:56:34,238
It's me... Kelly.

773
00:56:34,305 --> 00:56:35,372
Aah!

774
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,107
Aah!

775
00:56:40,045 --> 00:56:42,112
Aah! Aah! Aah!

776
00:56:58,463 --> 00:57:00,731
Uh!

777
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:03,167
Ow! Easy with the slapping!

778
00:57:03,234 --> 00:57:08,739
Tell me everything you know about
Augustus Steranko, or I'll cut out your heart.

779
00:57:08,807 --> 00:57:10,942
I was sent to protect him.

780
00:57:11,009 --> 00:57:15,345
- To protect him?
- Technically, yes.

781
00:57:15,413 --> 00:57:18,950
I could have killed him if it weren't for you.

782
00:57:19,017 --> 00:57:22,553
- I know who you are.
- You do?

783
00:57:22,621 --> 00:57:24,521
You're with Intelligence.

784
00:57:24,590 --> 00:57:29,060
But they're wrong. Steranko is the assassin.

785
00:57:29,127 --> 00:57:32,229
Thank God.

786
00:57:37,102 --> 00:57:40,304
Steranko? What are you talking about?

787
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:44,675
Look at this.

788
00:57:44,743 --> 00:57:48,145
Blade entrusted this to me before he left.

789
00:57:48,213 --> 00:57:50,982
The scorpion... that's Steranko's personal seal.

790
00:57:51,049 --> 00:57:53,751
It's the proof. Take it!

791
00:57:55,787 --> 00:58:00,925
Oh, Areola must have been working for him.

792
00:58:02,127 --> 00:58:03,594
Areola?

793
00:58:03,662 --> 00:58:10,034
Yeah, the woman who exploded in my hotel room.

794
00:58:10,102 --> 00:58:13,470
Listen to me. Blade was killed because of this.

795
00:58:13,538 --> 00:58:17,108
We've got to get to Orenbourg.

796
00:58:17,175 --> 00:58:19,110
What's this "we" stuff?

797
00:58:19,177 --> 00:58:20,577
You owe me.

798
00:58:20,646 --> 00:58:24,749
You let the man who killed my father get away.

799
00:58:24,816 --> 00:58:28,986
- Blade? The agent?
- Yes.

800
00:58:29,054 --> 00:58:33,958
Steranko's been stockpiling munitions,
preparing for something relating to that coin.

801
00:58:34,026 --> 00:58:36,961
This was supposed to be easy.

802
00:58:37,029 --> 00:58:39,030
They told my father that.

803
00:58:39,097 --> 00:58:41,398
With or without you, I'm going.

804
00:58:41,466 --> 00:58:52,910
Hey. I'll help you.

805
00:58:56,014 --> 00:59:00,718
# You lift me up and give me hope #

806
00:59:00,786 --> 00:59:03,721
# Every single day... #

807
00:59:03,789 --> 00:59:06,390
Corben, we thought you'd quit on us.

808
00:59:06,457 --> 00:59:10,027
I was forced to make that call at gunpoint.

809
00:59:10,095 --> 00:59:12,462
Where are you, Corben?

810
00:59:12,530 --> 00:59:15,032
I'm on my way to Orenbourg.

811
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:17,034
Steranko is the assassin.

812
00:59:17,102 --> 00:59:22,106
He killed those guys to get control of the gold.

813
00:59:22,174 --> 00:59:26,043
We can't accuse the Chairman
of the European Common Market

814
00:59:26,111 --> 00:59:30,214
of attempting murder and pulling off
the biggest robbery in history.

815
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:34,016
Augustus Steranko is our friend.

816
00:59:34,084 --> 00:59:36,418
The concept is mind-boggling.

817
00:59:36,485 --> 00:59:40,555
Well, then boggle on.
I'm on your mission, remember?

818
00:59:40,623 --> 00:59:43,558
# I'm a stranger here... #

819
00:59:43,626 --> 00:59:49,364
- The man is mad.
- And if he's not?

820
00:59:53,269 --> 00:59:59,074
# Teach me how to dream #

821
01:00:17,393 --> 01:00:19,394
This place is a fortress.

822
01:00:19,462 --> 01:00:22,564
The whole chateau is a powder keg.

823
01:00:22,632 --> 01:00:24,900
Christ, what an operation.

824
01:00:24,968 --> 01:00:27,202
I didn't expect this many guards.

825
01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:28,771
Damn!

826
01:00:31,674 --> 01:00:34,609
- Steranko.
- Where?

827
01:00:47,857 --> 01:00:51,226
What the hell are they doing here?

828
01:00:51,294 --> 01:00:57,432
- Who?
- Them. They're my... never mind.

829
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:00,635
I got to stop them.

830
01:01:00,703 --> 01:01:04,873
I will get to the bottom of this.

831
01:01:04,941 --> 01:01:11,513
Tell Augustus the French Teacher
and the mercenaries have arrived.

832
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:17,552
This is all very fascinating, I'm sure,
but this is not on the schedule.

833
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:22,024
We're supposed to be in Dijon.
Do you understand? Mustard Land!

834
01:01:22,091 --> 01:01:27,529
Last night we were supposed to be
in a youth hostel in Strasbourg.

835
01:01:27,596 --> 01:01:30,098
Shut up, you whining bitch!

836
01:01:38,641 --> 01:01:41,576
Mariska, I got a confession to make.

837
01:01:41,644 --> 01:01:44,579
I'm not with British or American Intelligence.

838
01:01:44,647 --> 01:01:48,150
- Who are you with?
- The French Club.

839
01:01:48,218 --> 01:01:51,086
You mean, you're not an agent?

840
01:01:51,154 --> 01:01:56,024
Listen, it seems like my whole life
I'm always coming close,

841
01:01:56,092 --> 01:01:58,026
but I never follow through.

842
01:01:58,094 --> 01:02:01,529
But this time, I'm going to make things right.

843
01:02:01,597 --> 01:02:08,503
I'm going to help you get Steranko,
and you're going to help me get my friends out.

844
01:02:08,571 --> 01:02:13,041
I'll come up with a plan.
Just give me a chance.

845
01:02:13,109 --> 01:02:14,509
Ok.

846
01:02:14,577 --> 01:02:16,078
You ready?

847
01:02:25,054 --> 01:02:27,722
Here's your chance.

848
01:02:27,790 --> 01:02:30,025
Inside! Keep her here.

849
01:02:30,093 --> 01:02:32,361
Hey!

850
01:02:32,428 --> 01:02:35,697
What's going on here? Leave her alone!

851
01:02:35,765 --> 01:02:37,165
Let me out!

852
01:02:37,233 --> 01:02:39,201
Get in!

853
01:02:40,636 --> 01:02:42,070
You ok?

854
01:02:42,138 --> 01:02:44,039
This can't be happening.

855
01:02:44,107 --> 01:02:49,111
Hey, scorpion boy,
why don't you try that shit with me?

856
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:53,481
They can't do this.

857
01:02:53,549 --> 01:02:56,018
They can do anything they want.

858
01:02:56,085 --> 01:03:01,189
If we don't have a plan,
we don't stand a chance.

859
01:03:02,425 --> 01:03:03,926
We have Corben.

860
01:03:03,993 --> 01:03:08,496
Good. Don't kill him yet.
I want to talk to him.

861
01:03:08,564 --> 01:03:11,533
Why do you want to talk to him?

862
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:14,536
I never get to talk to anyone.

863
01:03:14,603 --> 01:03:18,540
Talk, talk, talk.
Talking is your tragic flaw, Augustus.

864
01:03:18,607 --> 01:03:23,011
And you, grunt, are single-handedly
killing the art of conversation.

865
01:03:23,079 --> 01:03:26,014
Excuse me. Um, excuse me.

866
01:03:26,082 --> 01:03:31,153
I hate to interrupt,
but could you help us get out of here?

867
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:35,023
You. Who are you? Who sent you?

868
01:03:35,091 --> 01:03:38,026
How are you associated with Michael Corben?

869
01:03:38,094 --> 01:03:39,527
I'm Patricia Grober.

870
01:03:39,595 --> 01:03:42,931
I work for the Detroit Municipal School System.

871
01:03:42,999 --> 01:03:46,168
Michael Corben is my student. Are you satisfied?

872
01:03:46,235 --> 01:03:49,737
Don't toy with me, French Teacher!

873
01:03:49,805 --> 01:03:51,773
Aah! Aah!

874
01:03:51,841 --> 01:03:53,775
Ohh!

875
01:03:53,843 --> 01:03:56,044
Who sent you?

876
01:03:56,112 --> 01:03:59,214
I'll come up with a plan, ok?

877
01:04:01,050 --> 01:04:02,550
Put that on.

878
01:04:02,618 --> 01:04:06,388
You're having dinner with Steranko in 10 minutes.

879
01:04:07,857 --> 01:04:09,491
Jerk.

880
01:04:09,558 --> 01:04:14,997
If he thinks I'm wearing this army surplus
reject, he's out of his mind.

881
01:04:15,064 --> 01:04:16,999
It ain't my style.

882
01:04:17,066 --> 01:04:21,536
Michael, number one,
this is a very nice Armani suit.

883
01:04:21,604 --> 01:04:27,042
Number two, you have no style.
Don't you see?

884
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:33,781
This is the perfect opportunity.
You have to go to dinner with Steranko.

885
01:04:33,849 --> 01:04:37,019
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

886
01:04:37,086 --> 01:04:43,591
Augustus and I are very proud
and honored to welcome you.

887
01:04:57,940 --> 01:05:03,378
Here's my plan--I'm going to look him straight in the eye
and tell him we're all walking out of here.

888
01:05:03,446 --> 01:05:06,548
Michael, you have to kill Steranko.

889
01:05:08,051 --> 01:05:10,985
What do you mean, kill him?

890
01:05:11,054 --> 01:05:15,957
When will you realize
the kind of people we're dealing with?

891
01:05:16,025 --> 01:05:21,463
They're going to kill your friends.
They're going to kill us, too.

892
01:05:21,531 --> 01:05:23,131
Jeez, talk about peer pressure.

893
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:28,136
Michael, this is not a game!
You can't reason with these maniacs!

894
01:05:28,204 --> 01:05:29,704
Mariska!

895
01:05:46,055 --> 01:05:47,556
Very touching.

896
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:54,662
Ok, Corben, let's go. Dinner time.

897
01:05:55,731 --> 01:05:57,165
Move it!

898
01:05:57,233 --> 01:05:58,733
Schnell!

899
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:16,084
- Easy on the jacket, man. This is an Abalone suit.
- I know that.

900
01:06:21,624 --> 01:06:25,527
How pleasant to have this opportunity to dine with you.

901
01:06:29,098 --> 01:06:32,567
Careful, Mr. Corben.
That China is priceless.

902
01:06:32,635 --> 01:06:35,270
It once belonged to Catherine the Great.

903
01:06:42,111 --> 01:06:46,080
You've proven such a worthy
and persistent adversary.

904
01:06:46,149 --> 01:06:48,617
Can't you lose like a gentleman?

905
01:06:48,684 --> 01:06:51,153
I want my friends.

906
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:56,424
You refuse to eat with me, and now you ask me
for favors. Where are your manners?

907
01:06:56,492 --> 01:07:01,530
What could you possibly have
that would be of interest to me?

908
01:07:01,597 --> 01:07:03,898
I don't know. I mean...

909
01:07:05,468 --> 01:07:07,735
how about this?

910
01:07:10,072 --> 01:07:13,041
That belongs to me.

911
01:07:13,108 --> 01:07:16,545
Scorpion on the back. Kind of your trademark, isn't it?

912
01:07:16,612 --> 01:07:19,113
Kind of an insult to scorpions.

913
01:07:22,652 --> 01:07:26,521
Excuse me.
Have you been checked for rabies?

914
01:07:26,589 --> 01:07:29,991
- Rrr!
- Uh...

915
01:07:30,059 --> 01:07:33,061
Augustus, this looks like a prototype.

916
01:07:33,128 --> 01:07:38,166
You wouldn't be stealing that gold
and making coins, would you?

917
01:07:38,234 --> 01:07:43,538
With this bug on one side
and your butt-ugly face on the other?

918
01:07:43,606 --> 01:07:50,178
Bravo, Mr. Corben.
You're brighter than you look.

919
01:07:50,246 --> 01:07:55,417
Let me illuminate you further.

920
01:07:59,589 --> 01:08:06,027
A unified Europe... this has been the dream of
great men for over a thousand years.

921
01:08:06,095 --> 01:08:12,033
Now, Europe has unified out of economic necessity,
and history has played into my hands.

922
01:08:12,101 --> 01:08:15,203
Tonight, the key leaders will be here.

923
01:08:15,271 --> 01:08:21,476
They will raise a fatal toast to the new Europe,
to my Europe.

924
01:08:21,544 --> 01:08:28,916
Inevitably, they will need a new leader,
a visionary who can realize a utopia...

925
01:08:28,984 --> 01:08:31,553
a new, united Europe...

926
01:08:31,621 --> 01:08:38,226
a genius who can go beyond the failed dreams
of Alexander the Great, Napoleon, Hitler.

927
01:08:38,294 --> 01:08:40,729
Now, who will they turn to?

928
01:08:40,796 --> 01:08:46,635
They will turn to me!

929
01:08:46,702 --> 01:08:50,171
You can sure run a line of shit.

930
01:08:50,239 --> 01:08:53,708
- You mock me?
- Mock you? You're a lunatic.

931
01:08:53,776 --> 01:08:58,346
Fatal toast... you're going to poison everyone?
You'll never get away with it.

932
01:08:58,414 --> 01:08:59,914
Indeed, I will.

933
01:08:59,982 --> 01:09:03,351
You forced me to deviate from my original plan.

934
01:09:03,419 --> 01:09:08,490
The champagne that they're drinking tonight
is laced with a special poison,

935
01:09:08,557 --> 01:09:11,526
a poison developed by your own CIA.

936
01:09:11,594 --> 01:09:16,531
It lays dormant for several months,
until it attacks unpredictably.

937
01:09:16,599 --> 01:09:22,504
And those who ingest it die at random intervals,
apparently of natural causes.

938
01:09:22,571 --> 01:09:29,544
But now, of course, that plan is useless,
since you and British intelligence know so much.

939
01:09:29,612 --> 01:09:36,250
Now that I no longer have the luxury of time,
they must all die tonight.

940
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:40,522
You can't kill all those people.

941
01:09:40,589 --> 01:09:44,559
No, of course not.
I can't kill anyone.

942
01:09:44,627 --> 01:09:46,561
It's my fatal weakness.

943
01:09:46,629 --> 01:09:49,063
Violence completely unnerves me.

944
01:09:49,131 --> 01:09:54,502
No, when all is said and done,
I didn't kill anyone.

945
01:09:54,570 --> 01:09:59,006
- It was you.
- Me?

946
01:09:59,074 --> 01:10:06,581
When the authorities arrive,
I will show them the bodies of the terrorists
who infiltrated my chateau...

947
01:10:06,649 --> 01:10:10,084
burned beyond recognition.

948
01:10:10,152 --> 01:10:12,754
Beautiful, isn't it?

949
01:10:12,822 --> 01:10:15,857
I want my friends out of here now.

950
01:10:17,092 --> 01:10:21,463
Kill his friends.
Kill the girl and make him watch.

951
01:10:21,530 --> 01:10:24,466
No, you can't.

952
01:10:24,533 --> 01:10:29,070
Don't blame me for their fate.
You led them here.

953
01:10:29,137 --> 01:10:31,773
Your ineptitude paved the way for their demise.

954
01:10:31,841 --> 01:10:34,843
Your good intentions are not enough.

955
01:10:34,910 --> 01:10:39,514
To succeed, you must...
how can I put it?

956
01:10:39,582 --> 01:10:42,216
You must follow through.

957
01:10:45,921 --> 01:10:47,255
You're history, pal.

958
01:10:47,322 --> 01:10:50,658
I'm going to nail your ass to the wall!

959
01:10:50,726 --> 01:10:53,294
That sounds very painful.

960
01:10:55,564 --> 01:10:56,964
Get in there!

961
01:10:57,032 --> 01:11:03,872
You missed a great dinner, pal.
I dropped some leftovers in your trough.

962
01:11:05,474 --> 01:11:09,744
- Yes?
- No...

963
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:14,982
but we're getting out of here right now.

964
01:11:21,590 --> 01:11:25,259
We're going to chew our way out?

965
01:11:25,327 --> 01:11:28,530
You know the gum that goes squirt?

966
01:11:28,597 --> 01:11:31,566
This is the gum that goes boom.

967
01:11:52,087 --> 01:11:53,788
All right.

968
01:11:53,856 --> 01:11:55,122
Ok.

969
01:11:57,993 --> 01:11:59,727
Oh, shit.

970
01:11:59,795 --> 01:12:01,429
Ha!

971
01:12:01,497 --> 01:12:03,465
Corben?

972
01:12:03,532 --> 01:12:05,333
Oh, no!

973
01:12:07,336 --> 01:12:09,303
Where is he?

974
01:12:09,371 --> 01:12:12,774
Step on it. Double your pleasure, double your fun.

975
01:12:12,842 --> 01:12:15,109
Corben, show yourself!

976
01:12:15,177 --> 01:12:16,544
Yes!

977
01:12:16,612 --> 01:12:18,012
Corben!

978
01:12:23,085 --> 01:12:26,855
Hmm. Looks like he stepped out.

979
01:12:34,563 --> 01:12:36,063
It's them!

980
01:12:45,808 --> 01:12:49,010
I knew I should have taken Spanish.

981
01:12:49,077 --> 01:12:51,078
Somebody help us!

982
01:12:55,417 --> 01:12:58,019
Please let us out!

983
01:13:03,392 --> 01:13:08,062
God! They look like an order of fries.

984
01:13:08,130 --> 01:13:10,231
Oh, my God! Michael!

985
01:13:10,298 --> 01:13:12,099
I'll get you down!

986
01:13:12,167 --> 01:13:13,768
Michael, help us!

987
01:13:18,173 --> 01:13:21,409
We're all going to die!

988
01:13:21,476 --> 01:13:23,011
No, Corben's here!

989
01:13:23,078 --> 01:13:26,414
That's what I mean.

990
01:13:26,481 --> 01:13:27,649
Hurry!

991
01:13:27,716 --> 01:13:30,718
Michael, help us!

992
01:13:40,262 --> 01:13:42,496
Michael, hurry! Hurry!

993
01:13:42,565 --> 01:13:44,532
Michael!

994
01:13:53,542 --> 01:13:57,311
Pay attention, Mrs. Grober!
I'm going for extra credit!

995
01:14:03,185 --> 01:14:05,119
What's happening to us?

996
01:14:05,187 --> 01:14:07,321
We're sinking!

997
01:14:07,389 --> 01:14:09,523
I got everything under control...

998
01:14:09,592 --> 01:14:11,325
I think.

999
01:14:11,393 --> 01:14:12,627
Aah! Aah! Aah!

1000
01:14:15,163 --> 01:14:18,566
The nitrogen... it can freeze the gold.

1001
01:14:18,634 --> 01:14:23,004
Don't worry, Mrs. Grober.
The nitrogen... I'll freeze the gold... never mind.

1002
01:14:39,454 --> 01:14:40,989
All right, Michael!

1003
01:14:41,056 --> 01:14:42,523
Way to go!

1004
01:14:44,059 --> 01:14:46,027
Oh, God, it was terrible!

1005
01:14:46,095 --> 01:14:47,528
It was awful!

1006
01:14:47,596 --> 01:14:49,497
And they killed that man!

1007
01:14:49,564 --> 01:14:52,867
Michael, what is going on here?

1008
01:14:52,935 --> 01:14:59,040
Mrs. Grober, there's no time to explain,
but now you are "the French Teacher."

1009
01:14:59,108 --> 01:15:01,175
Hurry!

1010
01:15:12,054 --> 01:15:13,521
I understand.

1011
01:15:17,026 --> 01:15:20,762
Get to the reception, and don't let
them drink the champagne!

1012
01:15:20,829 --> 01:15:26,534
- Move out!
- Go! Go!

1013
01:15:36,812 --> 01:15:40,247
Hey! Your dick's on fire!

1014
01:15:40,315 --> 01:15:41,716
Made you look!

1015
01:15:48,590 --> 01:15:50,124
Shit!

1016
01:15:50,192 --> 01:15:51,159
Rrrr!

1017
01:15:51,226 --> 01:15:53,527
I was kidding about the rabies.

1018
01:16:01,136 --> 01:16:02,436
Aah!

1019
01:16:04,372 --> 01:16:05,606
Aah!

1020
01:16:31,633 --> 01:16:32,600
Oh!

1021
01:16:57,592 --> 01:17:02,529
Ladies and gentlemen,
raise your glasses with me now,

1022
01:17:02,597 --> 01:17:06,000
as we sweep aside centuries of animosity and ignorance

1023
01:17:06,068 --> 01:17:11,538
and grasp at the power
which has eluded us for so long.

1024
01:17:11,606 --> 01:17:13,507
Alone we are nothing.

1025
01:17:13,575 --> 01:17:15,542
Together we are supreme.

1026
01:17:15,610 --> 01:17:21,082
To a thousand years of peace...
and prosperity.

1027
01:17:24,153 --> 01:17:27,221
The bar's closed!

1028
01:17:27,289 --> 01:17:37,765
No! Continue with the toast!

1029
01:17:37,833 --> 01:17:39,233
Keep calm.

1030
01:17:39,301 --> 01:17:41,402
The champagne's poisoned!

1031
01:17:41,469 --> 01:17:47,541
Poisoned? That's preposterous.
We must stand together against this terrorist anarchy.

1032
01:17:47,609 --> 01:17:51,212
Who will drink with me to the new Europe?

1033
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:53,181
I'll drink with you.

1034
01:17:56,651 --> 01:17:59,053
Here's to a long life.

1035
01:18:03,391 --> 01:18:07,061
I'll nail your ass to the wall.

1036
01:18:13,902 --> 01:18:18,539
- Mariska, no!
- You killed my father!

1037
01:18:18,606 --> 01:18:22,476
No, dear. I killed your father.

1038
01:18:31,119 --> 01:18:34,922
I'll kill her. Amazingly enough, I will.

1039
01:18:36,225 --> 01:18:37,925
Augustus, hurry!

1040
01:18:39,527 --> 01:18:40,594
Michael!

1041
01:18:41,796 --> 01:18:43,965
You hurt her, and you're dead!

1042
01:18:46,134 --> 01:18:47,634
Corben!

1043
01:18:51,606 --> 01:18:53,474
We're sitting on a time bomb.

1044
01:18:53,541 --> 01:18:56,510
This place will explode! Everybody out!

1045
01:18:56,578 --> 01:18:57,611
All right!

1046
01:18:57,679 --> 01:18:59,747
Everybody move out!

1047
01:19:09,224 --> 01:19:12,193
Augustus, we've got to get out of here.

1048
01:19:12,261 --> 01:19:15,829
No. Just a few more bags. You, more bags! Hurry!

1049
01:19:21,836 --> 01:19:23,871
Mariska.

1050
01:19:36,584 --> 01:19:40,554
I'm not afraid to die.
I'm not afraid to die.

1051
01:19:40,622 --> 01:19:42,756
Who am I kidding?

1052
01:19:56,038 --> 01:19:58,739
Damn it! Nothing's happening.

1053
01:19:58,807 --> 01:20:00,041
Michael!

1054
01:20:01,643 --> 01:20:03,978
There's too much weight, Augustus!

1055
01:20:04,046 --> 01:20:06,580
Get rid of the girl.

1056
01:20:06,648 --> 01:20:08,015
Aah!

1057
01:20:08,083 --> 01:20:10,017
No!

1058
01:20:27,502 --> 01:20:30,137
We're still too heavy!

1059
01:20:30,205 --> 01:20:33,374
We've got to get rid of the gold!

1060
01:20:33,442 --> 01:20:37,111
- Not the gold!
- No!

1061
01:20:37,179 --> 01:20:38,679
Augustus!

1062
01:20:38,746 --> 01:20:40,281
Aah!

1063
01:20:52,894 --> 01:20:57,365
Augustus. It's not over.

1064
01:20:57,432 --> 01:20:59,800
Who will kill for you?

1065
01:20:59,868 --> 01:21:03,137
You taught me well.

1066
01:21:03,205 --> 01:21:05,672
Aah!

1067
01:21:21,256 --> 01:21:22,490
No! No!

1068
01:21:23,558 --> 01:21:25,859
Time to cash it in, Steranko!

1069
01:21:25,927 --> 01:21:28,362
My money! No! My gold!

1070
01:21:28,430 --> 01:21:29,997
No!

1071
01:21:30,065 --> 01:21:33,000
No, not my gold!

1072
01:21:33,068 --> 01:21:34,268
Aah!

1073
01:21:39,741 --> 01:21:41,275
Keep the change.

1074
01:21:43,111 --> 01:21:44,645
Oh, no! Come on!

1075
01:21:50,952 --> 01:21:52,053
Aah!

1076
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:54,422
Aah!

1077
01:22:07,001 --> 01:22:08,469
Move it!

1078
01:22:08,537 --> 01:22:10,304
Help us!

1079
01:22:10,372 --> 01:22:13,674
Help us! I'm the French Teacher!

1080
01:22:13,741 --> 01:22:15,976
She's coming right to us.

1081
01:22:16,044 --> 01:22:18,479
Contain that woman.

1082
01:22:18,547 --> 01:22:21,848
No, you don't understand. I'm a good guy.

1083
01:22:24,786 --> 01:22:32,460
- What now?
- Don't ask.

1084
01:22:38,066 --> 01:22:44,004
- Hang on to me real tight.
- What are you going to do?

1085
01:22:44,072 --> 01:22:46,474
Mariska, these sneakers walk down walls.

1086
01:22:46,541 --> 01:22:48,509
Put me down!

1087
01:22:48,577 --> 01:22:50,377
Aah! Aah!

1088
01:22:50,445 --> 01:22:51,712
Aah! Aah!

1089
01:22:51,779 --> 01:22:53,347
Aah!

1090
01:22:55,484 --> 01:23:01,422
I'm used to living on the edge...
just not this close.

1091
01:23:01,490 --> 01:23:11,165
Hang on, all right?
Don't worry. It's all downhill from here.

1092
01:23:17,005 --> 01:23:18,472
Where's Corben?

1093
01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:20,508
Oh, he's on the roof.

1094
01:23:28,517 --> 01:23:30,717
What will I tell his mother?

1095
01:23:30,785 --> 01:23:33,487
Oh, dear, Michael. I'm so sorry.

1096
01:23:33,555 --> 01:23:35,822
You don't understand. That's Michael Corben.

1097
01:23:35,890 --> 01:23:37,991
Oh, dear, Michael. Oh, Michael.

1098
01:23:48,236 --> 01:23:54,441
- Corben, you're alive! Good job! Well done!
- Congratulations.

1099
01:23:54,509 --> 01:23:57,344
- Corben. Michael Corben.
- Kent, man!

1100
01:23:59,648 --> 01:24:01,415
Thank you, Michael.

1101
01:24:01,483 --> 01:24:05,018
Michael! Michael, do something!

1102
01:24:05,086 --> 01:24:07,454
The French Teacher... she's with me.

1103
01:24:07,522 --> 01:24:09,456
You've got the credit!

1104
01:24:09,524 --> 01:24:13,160
And take my advice. Don't piss her off.

1105
01:24:13,228 --> 01:24:16,530
Oh, fine. Uh, let her go!

1106
01:24:16,598 --> 01:24:19,500
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1107
01:24:22,671 --> 01:24:28,975
- We'd like to get you back into service
as soon as possible.
- Hold on. He's our operative, remember?

1108
01:24:29,043 --> 01:24:32,646
We've got plenty of things lined up
for our top man.

1109
01:24:32,714 --> 01:24:37,951
Guys, I don't even want to try to explain
who I really am, ok?

1110
01:24:38,019 --> 01:24:45,492
The only thing that's going to happen now
is I'm going to take a vacation
and learn a little French.

1111
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:47,528
Au revoir... or something.

1112
01:24:54,669 --> 01:24:57,605
# Always running away #

1113
01:24:57,672 --> 01:25:00,407
 # Never seeing it through #

1114
01:25:00,475 --> 01:25:03,744
# But, baby, that's not how it's gonna be #

1115
01:25:03,811 --> 01:25:06,780
# When it comes to you #

1116
01:25:06,848 --> 01:25:09,783
# Don't know if we'll make it, girl #

1117
01:25:09,851 --> 01:25:12,620
# There's no way of knowing #

1118
01:25:12,687 --> 01:25:15,623
# Don't know what we're heading for #

1119
01:25:15,690 --> 01:25:19,793
# But I've got the faith to keep on going #

1120
01:25:19,861 --> 01:25:22,963
# There's no turning back #

1121
01:25:23,030 --> 01:25:24,798
# Too far gone for that #

1122
01:25:24,866 --> 01:25:28,802
# Oh, couldn't live another minute #

1123
01:25:28,870 --> 01:25:31,805
# In a world without you in it #

1124
01:25:31,873 --> 01:25:34,475
# No, no turning back #

1125
01:25:34,542 --> 01:25:36,777
# I got my heart on track #

1126
01:25:36,844 --> 01:25:39,980
# Oh, never had a lot to lose #

1127
01:25:40,047 --> 01:25:45,152
# But since I met you, baby, I do #

1128
01:25:45,219 --> 01:25:47,821
# If looks could kill #

1129
01:25:47,889 --> 01:25:50,491
# We'd be dead by now #

1130
01:25:50,558 --> 01:25:53,460
# 'Cause everyone we meet these days #

1131
01:25:53,528 --> 01:25:56,664
# Wants to shoot us down #

1132
01:25:56,731 --> 01:25:59,833
# But, baby, if we hold on tight #

1133
01:25:59,901 --> 01:26:02,636
# They could never tear us apart #

1134
01:26:02,704 --> 01:26:05,639
# So take it on through the night #

1135
01:26:05,707 --> 01:26:10,010
# We'll just follow our hearts, follow our hearts #

1136
01:26:10,077 --> 01:26:13,013
# There's no turning back #

1137
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:15,015
# Too far gone for that #

1138
01:26:15,082 --> 01:26:18,852
# Oh, couldn't live another minute #

1139
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:21,689
# In a world without you in it #

1140
01:26:21,756 --> 01:26:24,525
# No, no turning back #

1141
01:26:24,592 --> 01:26:26,660
# I got my heart on track #

1142
01:26:26,728 --> 01:26:30,030
# Oh, never had a lot to lose #

1143
01:26:30,097 --> 01:26:33,367
# But since I met you, baby, I do #

1144
01:26:33,435 --> 01:26:35,703
# Come and take my hand, we'll run as fast as we can #

1145
01:26:35,770 --> 01:26:38,038
# We're gonna make a break for daylight #

1146
01:26:38,105 --> 01:26:39,540
# Just staying out of sight #

1147
01:26:39,607 --> 01:26:41,875
# 'Cause we will already be a part of history #

1148
01:26:41,943 --> 01:26:43,544
# Young, cold, signed and sealed #

1149
01:26:43,611 --> 01:26:45,379
# Hiding out against our will #

1150
01:26:45,447 --> 01:26:48,382
# If looks could kill #

1151
01:26:48,450 --> 01:26:51,051
# If looks could kill #

1152
01:26:51,118 --> 01:26:54,154
# If looks could kill #

1153
01:26:54,222 --> 01:26:56,857
# If looks could kill #

1154
01:26:59,728 --> 01:27:04,297
# You lift me up and give me hope #

1155
01:27:04,366 --> 01:27:09,002
# Every single day #

1156
01:27:09,070 --> 01:27:16,677
# I never dreamed that I could feel this way #

1157
01:27:16,745 --> 01:27:22,716
# When I'm down, I know where I'm gonna turn #

1158
01:27:22,751 --> 01:27:27,354
# Ooh, I've got so much to learn #

1159
01:27:27,422 --> 01:27:30,524
# Teach me how to dream #

1160
01:27:30,592 --> 01:27:33,861
# Help me make a wish #

1161
01:27:33,928 --> 01:27:37,531
# If I wish for you #

1162
01:27:37,599 --> 01:27:43,704
# Will you make my wish come true? #

1163
01:27:43,772 --> 01:27:46,840
# I'm a stranger here #

1164
01:27:46,908 --> 01:27:50,677
# Strange as it may seem #

1165
01:27:50,745 --> 01:27:56,016
# Take me by the heart #

1166
01:28:00,221 --> 01:28:06,527
# Teach me how to dream #
