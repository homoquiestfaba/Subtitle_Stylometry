She escaped from the workhouse and came to the mountain.

That mountain woman was Molly Morgan.

We'll use the passageways

your hero doesn't seem able
to walk into a building without stealing.

Does the Sheriff know
about the drunken fights that go on in her house?

We caught her red-handed

She looked us right in the eye
and denied it.

No, that doesn't prove anything.
They have to look inside the mountain.

She was right about
the stolen boat.

- Guthrie found this on the dock.
