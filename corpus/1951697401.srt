1
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,698
Lord of all flesh...

2
00:02:20,698 --> 00:02:23,240
and in whose ever embrace
all creatures live.

3
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,174
And whatsoever world
or condition they be...

4
00:02:26,174 --> 00:02:30,874
I beseech Thee to pull her hand
to His name and dwell into.

5
00:02:30,874 --> 00:02:34,111
And every need Thou knowest.

6
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:38,953
Thou art life and rest,
refreshment...

7
00:02:38,953 --> 00:02:42,459
joy and consolation and paradise
and in companionship...

8
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:44,460
of the saints...

9
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,760
in the presence of Christ
and the hands that hold...

10
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,801
all guide with love.

11
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,042
Where's Father?

12
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,658
He's in the pub.

13
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:03,467
- It's the little sprat again.
- Poor creature.

14
00:04:03,467 --> 00:04:07,376
As pale as a fish's belly.
And those eyes!

15
00:04:07,376 --> 00:04:10,141
She's only lost in the world.

16
00:04:10,141 --> 00:04:14,379
And what would you be in a strange land
without a mother's touch?

17
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:18,547
- A drunkard!
- You're already that.

18
00:04:18,547 --> 00:04:22,388
Jim, wake up, will ya?
It's your daughter.

19
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:25,019
How are you, girl?

20
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:28,156
She's worn out.
Open your eyes!

21
00:04:28,156 --> 00:04:31,293
She looks as if she's raised
in a tin box.

22
00:04:31,293 --> 00:04:33,667
Fresh air. That's the ticket.

23
00:04:33,667 --> 00:04:37,640
A little sprat like her breathing
the poison fumes in this town's air.

24
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,642
Take her to the country.

25
00:04:39,642 --> 00:04:41,974
There's no work to be had at home.

26
00:04:41,974 --> 00:04:44,379
I'm never going back to the island.

27
00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:46,144
That's done.

28
00:04:46,144 --> 00:04:49,221
A lemon squash for you, dear.

29
00:04:49,221 --> 00:04:52,188
This isn't a place
to be raising a girl.

30
00:04:52,188 --> 00:04:53,690
I do my best.

31
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,351
You try, bless you.

32
00:04:56,351 --> 00:04:59,727
Why not send her to her grandfather's?

33
00:04:59,727 --> 00:05:02,801
You'd like that, wouldn't ya, love?

34
00:05:02,801 --> 00:05:06,393
You'd like that,
living with the old people.

35
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,038
Grandfather!

36
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:21,504
Fiona.

37
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:30,083
- We were expecting you later.
- Father put me on the morning boat.

38
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:33,590
You climbed all this way up
by yourself?

39
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,887
It's great to see ya!

40
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:40,293
Your grandmother saw you below.
She nearly had a fit.

41
00:06:40,293 --> 00:06:42,298
She knew it was me?

42
00:06:42,298 --> 00:06:47,372
With that head of hair? At double the
distance, I'd know you were a Coneelly.

43
00:06:47,372 --> 00:06:49,907
Your father and his brother the same.

44
00:06:49,907 --> 00:06:53,671
All but forJamie.
He's the only dark one.

45
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:58,716
You better not mention anything
aboutJamie in front of Grandmother.

46
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,056
She's gettin' the tea ready
for you now.

47
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:14,064
Oh, look at your arms, dear.

48
00:07:14,064 --> 00:07:16,600
Like sticks they are.

49
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,136
- Eat up now.
- It's the sea air she's needin'.

50
00:07:19,136 --> 00:07:22,139
I hear you can't find
a proper hen's egg in that city.

51
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:25,733
The ones here is nothing compared
to what was laid on the island.

52
00:07:25,733 --> 00:07:27,971
You and that island.

53
00:07:27,971 --> 00:07:32,574
'Tis true. Didn't our own cow only give
half the milk she gave in Roan Inish?

54
00:07:32,574 --> 00:07:36,415
What's done is done.
There's no use moaning over it.

55
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:38,751
Why did we have to leave?

56
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:43,123
It was the young people,
like your father and his brothers.

57
00:07:43,123 --> 00:07:45,526
They were restless on the island.

58
00:07:45,526 --> 00:07:49,192
Then came the war
and jobs across the sea.

59
00:07:49,192 --> 00:07:52,998
Now as they have the taste of the city
in their blood...

60
00:07:52,998 --> 00:07:56,472
City indeed!
Nothing but noise, dirt...

61
00:07:56,472 --> 00:07:59,009
and people that's lost their senses.

62
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:01,636
Couldn't tell the difference
between a riptide and a raindrop...

63
00:08:01,636 --> 00:08:04,807
if you shoved their face in the water.

64
00:08:04,807 --> 00:08:09,718
- But you and Grandmother...
- Oh, no. We couldn't start from naught.

65
00:08:09,718 --> 00:08:12,484
Living alone on an island.

66
00:08:12,484 --> 00:08:16,561
There isn't a thing out there for us
but sad memories.

67
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,598
Can you see it from here?

68
00:08:22,598 --> 00:08:24,669
If the sky is willing, some can.

69
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:32,535
Look out there.

70
00:08:32,535 --> 00:08:36,170
Do you see a lighthouse
on a long flat island?

71
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:38,044
I think I do.

72
00:08:38,044 --> 00:08:40,243
Then beyond there to your right...

73
00:08:40,243 --> 00:08:43,514
a great island of dark hills.

74
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:47,656
There's a wee green bit
of an island between them.

75
00:08:47,656 --> 00:08:50,557
- She sees it!
- You put it into her head!

76
00:08:50,557 --> 00:08:52,391
She sees it!

77
00:08:52,391 --> 00:08:56,059
Only them that's born to the islands
can see it from this distance.

78
00:08:56,059 --> 00:08:59,103
They say the east is our future
and the west is our past.

79
00:08:59,103 --> 00:09:01,672
The island's to the west of us, Hugh.

80
00:09:01,672 --> 00:09:05,538
That's Roan Inish, girl.
Island of the seals.

81
00:09:05,538 --> 00:09:08,476
There's more of them now
that the people have deserted.

82
00:09:08,476 --> 00:09:11,412
- You've been out there?
- Once a week if the current's right.

83
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:18,189
- God bless all here.
- Eamon! Get in and sit for tea.

84
00:09:18,189 --> 00:09:22,761
You remember him, Fiona?
Your cousin Eamon, Uncle Patrick's boy.

85
00:09:22,761 --> 00:09:24,089
Hello.

86
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:27,358
You moved back to the west.
Are you pleased?

87
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,865
I'm well pleased.

88
00:09:28,865 --> 00:09:31,765
How come you never left
with your family?

89
00:09:31,765 --> 00:09:34,873
I tried it for a month,
then I ran back here.

90
00:09:34,873 --> 00:09:38,807
I'm not clever enough to live in town.
Too fast for me.

91
00:09:38,807 --> 00:09:41,539
He's as good a young fella in a curragh
as ever I've seen.

92
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:44,275
Love of the sea is a sickness.

93
00:09:44,275 --> 00:09:48,080
You two will come to grief for it.
Eat.

94
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,087
- She seen Roan Inish on her first look.
- Is that so?

95
00:09:51,087 --> 00:09:53,157
You go there, too?

96
00:09:53,157 --> 00:09:55,624
I've not set foot there
since the evacuation.

97
00:09:55,624 --> 00:09:58,059
But Grandfather knows the shoals
all about it...

98
00:09:58,059 --> 00:10:00,165
and what feeds there and when.

99
00:10:00,165 --> 00:10:04,633
We always come back with a full net
when the rest are scared to fish it.

100
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:08,897
- Why are they scared?
- Eamon.

101
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:13,135
Oh. Tales is all.

102
00:10:13,135 --> 00:10:14,644
Tales of what?

103
00:10:14,644 --> 00:10:18,944
If it clears up this evening,
you might see the light again.

104
00:10:18,944 --> 00:10:19,664
Light?

105
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:23,018
There's an end of it!

106
00:10:23,018 --> 00:10:26,454
I'll not have nonsense
and superstition in my house.

107
00:10:26,454 --> 00:10:29,959
Here. Do your duty by those cakes.

108
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:33,862
They won't keep. Your grandfather's
already filled his gullet.

109
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:48,872
The sea gives,
and the sea takes away.

110
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,975
This...

111
00:10:52,975 --> 00:10:56,987
is my father's father's father now...

112
00:10:56,987 --> 00:10:58,647
a Coneelly man...

113
00:10:58,647 --> 00:11:01,885
when he was only a few years older
than you are now.

114
00:11:01,885 --> 00:11:03,928
His name was Sean Michael.

115
00:11:03,928 --> 00:11:07,726
Smart boy, dark haired.
Bit of the rebel in him.

116
00:11:07,726 --> 00:11:11,598
Though times weren't as hard
on the island as on the mainland...

117
00:11:11,598 --> 00:11:14,171
it's never easy pulling a living
from the sea.

118
00:11:14,171 --> 00:11:18,003
The English were still a force
in the country then.

119
00:11:18,003 --> 00:11:20,009
They had the schools.

120
00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:25,174
It was their language and their ways
that you had to learn there, or else.

121
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:30,019
There was a new schoolmaster
in the school one year.

122
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:32,522
As stiff as a cat's whiskers, he was.

123
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,223
And Sean Michael wasn't a week
in his class...

124
00:11:37,223 --> 00:11:40,127
before he put the cingulum
about his neck.

125
00:11:40,127 --> 00:11:44,168
It was a punishment of those days
for speaking irish within his earshot.

126
00:11:44,168 --> 00:11:46,669
Eject! Eject!

127
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:54,112
Sean Michael stuck it out
for as long as he could...

128
00:11:54,112 --> 00:11:57,272
for he had a strength of character.

129
00:11:57,272 --> 00:12:01,182
But the shame was too great,
and he tore it from his neck...

130
00:12:01,182 --> 00:12:05,051
and he went for the schoolmaster and
began to beat on the man crying out...

131
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:11,428
Hugh, please!

132
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:15,028
It's a little girl.

133
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,369
You don't understand,
do you, girl?

134
00:12:20,369 --> 00:12:22,371
I don't have any Irish.

135
00:12:22,371 --> 00:12:25,602
- More is the pity of it.
- Aye.

136
00:12:25,602 --> 00:12:30,205
Sean Michael's father had great hopes
for the boy, clever as he was...

137
00:12:30,205 --> 00:12:32,874
that he would learn to read
the Englishman's language...

138
00:12:32,874 --> 00:12:37,352
and study his laws, and grow to be
a leader for his people.

139
00:12:37,352 --> 00:12:40,982
But there was his son, knuckles bloody,
anger in his heart...

140
00:12:40,982 --> 00:12:42,992
standing before him.

141
00:12:42,992 --> 00:12:47,361
"You'll need to kill me
to make me go back," he says.

142
00:12:47,361 --> 00:12:51,664
His father sighed then,
and looked out to the sea beyond them.

143
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:55,305
"You'll have nothing now," he said...

144
00:12:55,305 --> 00:13:00,140
"but the black rocks, the wild waves
and the hard sky above you."

145
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:04,306
And wasn't it his first trip out
with his father...

146
00:13:04,306 --> 00:13:08,113
that a fierce storm from the north
blew over them.

147
00:13:08,113 --> 00:13:13,351
Sean Michael, his father,
brothers, uncles and cousins...

148
00:13:13,351 --> 00:13:15,426
four boats in all.

149
00:13:15,426 --> 00:13:17,688
And it took them in its terrible grip...

150
00:13:17,688 --> 00:13:20,355
lifted them high
and turned them over...

151
00:13:20,355 --> 00:13:24,196
and slapped them back down
into the violent black sea...

152
00:13:24,196 --> 00:13:26,998
with the scraps
of their curraghs around them.

153
00:13:26,998 --> 00:13:31,576
His father, caught in their net
and dragged below without a whisper.

154
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:38,009
Out as far as they were, in a northern
storm, an experienced fisherman...

155
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:42,052
would swallow his draught of water
and swim to the bottom.

156
00:13:42,052 --> 00:13:46,022
For to fight the cold sea
is only to prolong your suffering.

157
00:13:46,022 --> 00:13:48,626
But Sean Michael was green with it.

158
00:13:48,626 --> 00:13:50,820
And he flailed and cried out...

159
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,659
and he beat the water
with his legs and arms...

160
00:13:53,659 --> 00:13:57,496
till the sea grew to hate him
and refused to swallow him up.

161
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,211
It was a full day later...

162
00:14:09,211 --> 00:14:12,749
when people gathering mussels
on the strand found him.

163
00:14:12,749 --> 00:14:14,910
Some was even afraid to touch him.

164
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:20,254
It was women mostly,
softhearted as they are.

165
00:14:20,254 --> 00:14:24,886
The boy was more dead than alive.
Cold as ice to the touch.

166
00:14:24,886 --> 00:14:27,931
There wasn't a fire in ireland could
bring the blood of life back into him.

167
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:34,603
This is the time when the country people
still lived with their beasts inside.

168
00:14:34,603 --> 00:14:37,436
And the woman as owned the house
they brought him to said...

169
00:14:37,436 --> 00:14:40,545
"Here, bind him up to my cow."

170
00:14:40,545 --> 00:14:42,977
And then she brought another alongside.

171
00:14:42,977 --> 00:14:45,777
And their heat went out through him.

172
00:14:45,777 --> 00:14:50,651
Soon he began to shiver,
and then he began to shake.

173
00:14:50,651 --> 00:14:53,849
And then he slept like a Christian...

174
00:14:53,849 --> 00:14:56,154
for hours and hours.

175
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:06,362
When he started to sweat, the woman
cut him loose from her animals...

176
00:15:06,362 --> 00:15:11,033
and they bathed him, and wrapped him
in blankets warmed in the hearth.

177
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,832
He woke to their faces above him...

178
00:15:35,832 --> 00:15:38,562
all women and girls.

179
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,729
"Is this heaven, then?"he said.

180
00:15:40,729 --> 00:15:43,933
"No, lad,"said the woman of the house.

181
00:15:43,933 --> 00:15:47,341
"It's only Tech Duin."

182
00:15:47,341 --> 00:15:49,777
Tech Duin is the islands
where the people thought...

183
00:15:49,777 --> 00:15:53,214
that the souls of all Ireland's dead
were held to rest.

184
00:15:53,214 --> 00:15:56,719
So Sean Michael
believed he had drowned...

185
00:15:56,719 --> 00:15:58,880
and come to the hereafter.

186
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:05,389
"'Twas a seal that brought me here,"
he told them.

187
00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:07,499
"I was sinking under...

188
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:11,763
destroyed by the effort
of keeping my head above the swell.

189
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:14,839
And a body, warm body...

190
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:17,909
came under me and lifted me up.

191
00:16:17,909 --> 00:16:20,511
It was a seal
from the feel of its hide.

192
00:16:20,511 --> 00:16:24,207
A great dark seal that bore me
along through the storm...

193
00:16:24,207 --> 00:16:26,284
and i hugging its neck.

194
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:33,155
That's all i remember until i woke
to your faces above me."

195
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:37,862
Now, with his father and brothers...

196
00:16:37,862 --> 00:16:41,398
and uncles and cousins all gone...

197
00:16:41,398 --> 00:16:44,024
there was only Sean Michael left...

198
00:16:44,024 --> 00:16:47,366
to keep the Coneellys alive
in these islands.

199
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,072
He was saved by a seal?

200
00:16:50,072 --> 00:16:53,736
- And two cows.
- And a woman as had her wits about her.

201
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,747
It's a wonderful story.

202
00:16:56,747 --> 00:16:58,782
Some think so.

203
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:05,380
And some say you should
never save a drowning man.

204
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:09,016
What the sea will take,
the sea must have.

205
00:17:09,016 --> 00:17:11,152
That's a lot of foolishness.

206
00:17:11,152 --> 00:17:14,231
It's said that some that are saved
turn wicked afterwards.

207
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:18,569
What happened to Sean Michael,
your great-grandfather?

208
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:21,664
Jailed by the English.

209
00:17:21,664 --> 00:17:25,004
Died in prison a man of 50.

210
00:17:25,004 --> 00:17:27,874
Smuggling arms to the Fenians,
he was.

211
00:17:27,874 --> 00:17:29,878
That's enough for now.

212
00:17:29,878 --> 00:17:33,542
Take the child to bed, Hugh.
She's exhausted.

213
00:17:33,542 --> 00:17:34,542
Aye.

214
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:41,556
Sweet dreams, dear.

215
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,298
Superstitious old man!

216
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:07,809
I rake this fire
as the pure Christ rakes us all...

217
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:11,320
with Mary at the foot
and Brigid at the head.

218
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:17,119
And may the eight brightest angels
from the City of Grace...

219
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:21,164
preserwe this house and all its people
till the coming of the day.

220
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:21,218
The light.

221
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:28,460
Out into the sun with you, now.

222
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,865
You'll find him below on the strand.

223
00:19:31,865 --> 00:19:34,631
Just follow the path across.

224
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:07,068
Grandfather!

225
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,835
Ah, Fiona!

226
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:14,803
I was just wishing
I had someone to lend me a hand.

227
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:23,216
It'd be a great help to me if you
kept stirring the tar in this bucket.

228
00:20:23,216 --> 00:20:25,913
I'd love it.

229
00:20:25,913 --> 00:20:30,152
In the olden times
people used cowhide on their curraghs.

230
00:20:30,152 --> 00:20:32,297
Then it was calico.

231
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:34,625
Now we make do with canvas.

232
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:38,264
The tar is what it always was.

233
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,185
- Would you like some tea?
- Yes, please.

234
00:20:55,185 --> 00:20:57,584
She's put in an extra mug for ya.

235
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:04,989
There.

236
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,840
I think I saw the light last night.

237
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,741
Light, is it?
What light might that be?

238
00:21:21,741 --> 00:21:24,211
The one Eamon spoke of
on Roan Inish.

239
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:29,747
There's plenty of things could be taken
for a light in the dark.

240
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:32,446
And no tellin' how far off
they might be.

241
00:21:32,446 --> 00:21:34,489
You want me
to forget aboutJamie.

242
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,431
We'll none of us forget him, dear.

243
00:21:41,431 --> 00:21:43,727
But life goes on.

244
00:21:43,727 --> 00:21:46,063
Can't even remember when we lost him.

245
00:21:46,063 --> 00:21:49,002
I was already off in the ship
when it happened.

246
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,735
It was a strange day.

247
00:21:52,735 --> 00:21:56,005
Everyone on the beach
for the evacuation.

248
00:21:56,005 --> 00:22:00,777
The air was very still,
like it is sometimes before a storm.

249
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:04,251
It was like a dream that day...

250
00:22:04,251 --> 00:22:08,018
slow, terrible dream that you watch.

251
00:22:08,018 --> 00:22:10,058
You can't stop it.

252
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:15,132
All the people had rode out,
and most of the goods.

253
00:22:15,132 --> 00:22:18,701
There was only your father
and brother ashore...

254
00:22:18,701 --> 00:22:23,273
and weeJamie sleeping in his cradle.

255
00:22:23,273 --> 00:22:25,376
- In his cradle?
- Aye.

256
00:22:25,376 --> 00:22:28,479
Pulled up on the beach.

257
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:12,103
Jamie!

258
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:24,219
Wait! Help me!

259
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:44,178
Look there!

260
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:54,978
Jamie!

261
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:36,218
"Jamie!" he called.

262
00:26:36,218 --> 00:26:38,419
"We're comin', boy."

263
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:44,697
I don't know how the cradle
could've made up so much speed.

264
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:50,068
The sea had taken
poor weeJamie.

265
00:26:50,068 --> 00:26:53,871
It was angry with us
for leavin' Roan Inish.

266
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:03,577
Mind that tar, love, or it'll be stiffer
than an old man on a winter's night.

267
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:08,590
- He could still be out there.
- Jamie?

268
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:10,194
Alive?

269
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,723
And cows could have wings.

270
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:33,145
You see this?

271
00:27:33,145 --> 00:27:35,650
It's a seal rent it open.

272
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:37,652
They're terrible rascals
for stealin' fish.

273
00:27:37,652 --> 00:27:40,019
One stared at me
from the rock when I came in.

274
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:43,094
Maybe he's fell in love.

275
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:45,855
You've got to be careful
'cause one day a year...

276
00:27:45,855 --> 00:27:48,591
all the seals gather
to choose their new king.

277
00:27:48,591 --> 00:27:51,702
And it's said whichever
of the island girls he fancies most...

278
00:27:51,702 --> 00:27:54,862
is taken below to live
as his queen.

279
00:27:54,862 --> 00:27:58,669
- That's just stories.
- Some stories is true, though.

280
00:27:58,669 --> 00:28:02,439
Grandfather told me aboutJamie,
about when he was taken.

281
00:28:02,439 --> 00:28:04,980
- Did he tell you the rumors?
- About what?

282
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:08,813
There's them who claim
to have seen him.

283
00:28:08,813 --> 00:28:12,116
LittleJamie sailing the seas
in his cradle boat.

284
00:28:12,116 --> 00:28:14,122
What does he look like?

285
00:28:14,122 --> 00:28:16,750
They say he's grown
into a fine little gossoon...

286
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:20,796
sittin' in the stern of his cradle
like a captain in his ship.

287
00:28:20,796 --> 00:28:22,866
Always there's creatures about him.

288
00:28:22,866 --> 00:28:25,366
Seals swimmin' in the water...

289
00:28:25,366 --> 00:28:27,937
great crowd of sea gulls
squawkin' overhead.

290
00:28:27,937 --> 00:28:31,735
If you call out or try to come closer,
he vanishes...

291
00:28:31,735 --> 00:28:36,279
in a great splash in the water and wings
flappin' like a phantom they say.

292
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:38,348
Where do they see him?

293
00:28:38,348 --> 00:28:41,077
Comin' back from the far side
of the island, close to Roan Inish.

294
00:28:41,077 --> 00:28:44,586
- Grandfather!
- Shh! Don't let on I told you!

295
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,424
What is it?

296
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:53,291
Can I go out with you sometimes
in your boat?

297
00:28:53,291 --> 00:28:56,264
It'll be a few days
before the tar is dried.

298
00:28:56,264 --> 00:28:57,368
Then?

299
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:02,569
Well, we'll have to ask
your grandmother first.

300
00:29:02,569 --> 00:29:06,040
She won't have you out on a boat
unless the day is fine.

301
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:26,928
Grandmother!

302
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:39,308
I've lost track.
Is this Roan Inish?

303
00:29:39,308 --> 00:29:42,504
Quiet now, and you'll see something.

304
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:05,297
See that little fellow?
It's his first year at sea.

305
00:30:05,297 --> 00:30:09,202
He's the one that stared at me
from the boat coming over.

306
00:30:09,202 --> 00:30:11,274
I'm sure he is.

307
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:27,783
You scared 'em away
with your screechin'.

308
00:30:27,783 --> 00:30:32,056
He was the one I saw.
He really did remember me.

309
00:30:32,056 --> 00:30:35,098
Hide your face then,
or he'll be takin' you for a wife.

310
00:30:35,098 --> 00:30:37,724
- Don't scare the child.
- Fiona's never scared.

311
00:30:37,724 --> 00:30:40,804
- Are you?
- His name is Jax.

312
00:30:40,804 --> 00:30:43,464
- How do you know that?
- It just is.

313
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:46,701
- There it is.
- Roan Inish?

314
00:30:46,701 --> 00:30:47,701
Aye.

315
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:51,479
Isn't it beautiful?

316
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:35,426
Do you remember it, Fiona?
That was your house at that end.

317
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:41,559
- Tess and I were next door.
- And ours was the one beyond.

318
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:48,270
Right. We'll set those pots
and be back.

319
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:50,271
Don't wander too far.

320
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,710
I wish you could talk to me.

321
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:01,996
Fiona!

322
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:20,483
We better be goin'
while the tide's still with us.

323
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:33,028
- Do you miss it greatly?
- Roan Inish?

324
00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:37,759
It's only a place, I suppose.

325
00:35:37,759 --> 00:35:40,302
Mostly I miss the way of life.

326
00:35:40,302 --> 00:35:43,874
You're surrounded by the sea,
your whole family about you.

327
00:35:43,874 --> 00:35:46,238
I'm movin' back.

328
00:35:46,238 --> 00:35:48,470
When I'm a man.

329
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:52,811
You'll be a sorry sight on your own,
hauntin' the island on your lonesome.

330
00:35:52,811 --> 00:35:56,215
- I'll have a wife.
- But will she have you?

331
00:35:57,255 --> 00:36:01,919
Not many women these days see
much romance in hard work and solitude.

332
00:36:01,919 --> 00:36:04,755
I'm movin' back just the same.

333
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,098
I remember the evenings best.

334
00:36:12,098 --> 00:36:15,228
We'd drop over and your mother,
God rest her...

335
00:36:15,228 --> 00:36:17,807
would be layin' out food.

336
00:36:17,807 --> 00:36:20,968
Your father smokin',
dryin' his feet by the fire.

337
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:25,878
Then you, Fiona, and poor weeJamie...

338
00:36:25,878 --> 00:36:30,078
off in the corner
with little pieces of dinnerware.

339
00:36:30,078 --> 00:36:32,348
Tea parties, it was.

340
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:36,923
You were always a great one
for the tea parties.

341
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:46,703
Someone's been in our old cottage.

342
00:36:46,703 --> 00:36:48,998
- Vandals, is it?
- No.

343
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:51,199
Someone is living there.

344
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:53,207
Don't be daft.

345
00:36:53,207 --> 00:36:56,541
I saw a footprint,
a footprint of a little boy.

346
00:36:57,648 --> 00:37:01,243
- Why didn't you show it to us?
- A wave destroyed it.

347
00:37:01,243 --> 00:37:04,821
There's all sorts of things that
can look like a footprint in the shore.

348
00:37:04,821 --> 00:37:08,050
I saw it! I did!

349
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:15,661
- So you saw the island today?
- Yes.

350
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:22,138
And the houses are in
a terrible state, I suppose?

351
00:37:22,138 --> 00:37:24,764
They weren't so bad,
with a little cleaning.

352
00:37:24,764 --> 00:37:29,005
Ah, if you're idle for a week,
nature takes it back.

353
00:37:29,005 --> 00:37:32,081
There'll be birds nestin'
in the thatch and chimney.

354
00:37:32,081 --> 00:37:35,276
Creepy-crawly things
in every corner.

355
00:37:35,276 --> 00:37:39,480
It wasn't so bad. Our old cottage
looked as if we left it a day ago.

356
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,525
There was sand and everything,
blowin' off the beach.

357
00:37:42,525 --> 00:37:45,094
It was clean, though.

358
00:37:45,094 --> 00:37:47,288
And the mornings...

359
00:37:47,288 --> 00:37:49,763
and the mist on the water.

360
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:55,235
We could move back. Grandfather said
it's the best fishing.

361
00:37:55,235 --> 00:37:58,069
Oh, child, I couldn't think of it.

362
00:37:58,069 --> 00:38:02,908
I've only the picture in my mind of
your poor little brother floatin' away.

363
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:09,148
The only real tragedy in life is young
people passin' on before their time.

364
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,586
I always remember his eyes.

365
00:38:12,586 --> 00:38:17,057
Dark they were,
with a great soul behind them.

366
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:22,164
Oh, he was here before.

367
00:38:22,164 --> 00:38:23,699
Jamie.

368
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,900
Tess, don't start.

369
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:31,965
Right.

370
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:49,717
One and a quarter pounds
to the grain.

371
00:38:49,717 --> 00:38:52,727
You're a mean, penny-pinchin'
creature, Flynn.

372
00:38:52,727 --> 00:38:54,831
Fiona, darlin',
you have my purse.

373
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:04,396
- Is this the granddaughter then?
- It is.

374
00:39:04,396 --> 00:39:07,409
She isn't one of the dark ones,
is she?

375
00:39:07,409 --> 00:39:10,412
Mind your own business.

376
00:39:10,412 --> 00:39:13,346
You wait here, darlin',
while I go and fetch your grandfather.

377
00:39:13,346 --> 00:39:15,179
I could get him.

378
00:39:15,179 --> 00:39:19,221
I'll not have a young girl
exposed to the layabouts in that pub.

379
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:26,194
You call this fresh, do you?
You ought to be ashamed.

380
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:31,060
She's the original tough customer,
old Tess.

381
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,972
What's "dark ones"?

382
00:39:35,972 --> 00:39:38,234
You said before
that I wasn't a dark one.

383
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:42,944
- Haven't they told you?
- Told me what?

384
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,814
Come along then.

385
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:03,055
There's an example for you.

386
00:40:03,055 --> 00:40:05,168
Tadhg'd be your father's first cousin.

387
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:09,670
Once in a generation
the Coneelly's spit out a dark one.

388
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:12,640
- Like my brotherJamie?
- Aye!

389
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,371
Tadhg would be the one
ahead of him.

390
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,879
Will he know me?

391
00:40:17,879 --> 00:40:22,543
You can talk to him if you like, but
there's no saying if he'll talk back.

392
00:40:22,543 --> 00:40:25,484
He's a bit special,
if you know what I mean.

393
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,304
Hello.

394
00:40:45,676 --> 00:40:49,942
I'm Fiona, Fiona Coneelly.
You know my father.

395
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:54,214
I know you.

396
00:40:54,214 --> 00:40:55,682
You do?

397
00:40:56,787 --> 00:41:00,018
- You're after something?
- I am?

398
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,525
It's as plain as day.

399
00:41:03,525 --> 00:41:05,652
Will I find it?

400
00:41:05,652 --> 00:41:08,162
I've no idea of the future...

401
00:41:08,162 --> 00:41:11,166
but I can see the past quite well...

402
00:41:11,166 --> 00:41:13,202
and the present,
if the weather's clear.

403
00:41:13,202 --> 00:41:16,500
Better leave off.
You're frightening the wee girl.

404
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,733
She's not easily frightened, this one.

405
00:41:18,733 --> 00:41:21,071
Am I right?

406
00:41:23,113 --> 00:41:27,015
- Do you know why I'm dark?
- 'Cause his brain's leakin' shoe polish.

407
00:41:27,015 --> 00:41:29,016
- That's enough!
- Easy.

408
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:42,498
The Coneellys first came
to Roan Inish...

409
00:41:42,498 --> 00:41:46,160
when it was still only Irish spoken
on the islands.

410
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,737
They built their meager homes
on the beach...

411
00:41:48,737 --> 00:41:52,866
and the seals and the birds moved aside
to make room for them.

412
00:41:52,866 --> 00:41:55,069
There's only a few families,
and all related.

413
00:41:56,347 --> 00:42:00,977
So when it came time to find a mate,
it was elsewhere you had to look.

414
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:05,917
There was a boy among them, Liam...

415
00:42:05,917 --> 00:42:09,025
who always preferred to be alone.

416
00:42:09,025 --> 00:42:11,957
He set his own traps,
built his own curragh.

417
00:42:11,957 --> 00:42:14,394
He sat alone
at all the family gatherings.

418
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:19,769
One day walking about
the outer islands...

419
00:42:19,769 --> 00:42:23,738
he saw a thing his eyes
could scarce believe.

420
00:42:25,342 --> 00:42:29,403
In them days, the seals was hunted
for their oil and hides.

421
00:42:29,403 --> 00:42:33,881
Clubbed to death, and made into coats,
pouches and pampooties for the feet.

422
00:42:33,881 --> 00:42:36,509
But Liam never took part in it...

423
00:42:36,509 --> 00:42:38,986
for he believed as many did then...

424
00:42:38,986 --> 00:42:42,183
that there was no worse luck
than to harm a seal.

425
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:53,828
Liam had seen a selkie.

426
00:42:53,828 --> 00:42:57,168
A creature that's half human,
half beast.

427
00:42:58,275 --> 00:43:00,766
Old stories told of such creatures...

428
00:43:00,766 --> 00:43:05,439
luring ships onto the rocks,
and pulling sailors down into the drink.

429
00:43:05,439 --> 00:43:07,778
But all Liam knew...

430
00:43:07,778 --> 00:43:11,684
was he had never seen a woman
so lovely in all his life.

431
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:09,176
Now it was said the whoever
could capture the hide of a selkie...

432
00:44:09,176 --> 00:44:11,247
would have it in their power...

433
00:44:11,247 --> 00:44:14,215
to command as they would.

434
00:44:14,215 --> 00:44:16,683
The selkie maid
had seen man before.

435
00:44:16,683 --> 00:44:21,052
Fled from their fishing hooks
and their spears and mattocks.

436
00:44:21,052 --> 00:44:25,685
But never had she seen one
as glorious handsome as Liam Coneelly.

437
00:44:58,262 --> 00:45:03,029
All the islanders
had seen Liam row out to sea alone.

438
00:45:03,029 --> 00:45:06,694
And now all saw his return
with the strange girl.

439
00:45:09,573 --> 00:45:11,632
Island people is a careful lot.

440
00:45:11,632 --> 00:45:16,235
Not likely to pass judgment
on another person's business in public.

441
00:45:18,015 --> 00:45:20,984
There was something so unearthly
about the girl...

442
00:45:20,984 --> 00:45:23,848
that soon set their tongues to wagging.

443
00:45:26,023 --> 00:45:29,424
There was much shaking of heads
when Liam married the stranger.

444
00:45:29,424 --> 00:45:32,188
She hardly spoke at all,
and when she did...

445
00:45:32,188 --> 00:45:34,593
her Irish was queer sounding.

446
00:45:34,593 --> 00:45:37,997
More ancient
than their grandfather's grandfather's.

447
00:45:37,997 --> 00:45:41,070
And when they asked him
where he had found her...

448
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:43,105
with her great dark eyes...

449
00:45:43,105 --> 00:45:45,572
and her wild black hair...

450
00:45:45,572 --> 00:45:47,802
he'd only say Trabeg.

451
00:45:47,802 --> 00:45:51,073
Of course this was nonsense because
it was only a speck in the ocean...

452
00:45:51,073 --> 00:45:54,844
that even the seals had to leave
when the tide was high.

453
00:45:54,844 --> 00:45:57,613
And she'd always be at the water...

454
00:45:57,613 --> 00:46:00,349
Iooking out at the seals and the birds.

455
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:16,467
She'd come back each day with her hands
full of shellfish and seaweed...

456
00:46:16,467 --> 00:46:19,542
which she'd simmer
over a driftwood fire...

457
00:46:19,542 --> 00:46:21,667
in a manner all her own.

458
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:30,848
But all had to admit
that she was a good wife for their Liam.

459
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:36,152
Before long, she was asking him
to build a cradle for their firstborn.

460
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:41,692
It must be made of the wood of a ship
that sailed the ocean, she told him.

461
00:46:41,692 --> 00:46:46,496
And there'll be no need for rockers for
it will rock on the motion of the sea.

462
00:46:46,496 --> 00:46:49,663
It was the queerest-lookin'thing.

463
00:46:49,663 --> 00:46:52,037
More of a ship than cradle.

464
00:46:52,037 --> 00:46:55,475
And carved with shells, fish
and seaweed.

465
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:12,252
And whenever the day was calm,
they put the babe afloat on the water.

466
00:47:12,252 --> 00:47:17,333
Rocking on the sea, with the ripple
of the waves for a lullaby.

467
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:27,099
The years passed...

468
00:47:27,099 --> 00:47:31,078
and Liam and Nuala, for that's what
the selkie called herself...

469
00:47:31,078 --> 00:47:33,149
was happy in their work.

470
00:47:33,149 --> 00:47:37,276
And their love grew
and they had many children.

471
00:47:37,276 --> 00:47:39,685
With all that...

472
00:47:39,685 --> 00:47:43,520
there was always a touch of sadness
about Nuala.

473
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:47,323
And she spent long hours looking out
at that that she had come from.

474
00:47:47,323 --> 00:47:51,901
And listening to the cries of the seals
on the outer islands.

475
00:47:51,901 --> 00:47:54,629
One of these afternoons,
it was her eldest...

476
00:47:54,629 --> 00:47:57,501
who was called Fiona...

477
00:47:57,501 --> 00:48:00,735
said the words to her
that changed their home.

478
00:48:07,317 --> 00:48:11,117
Why does Father hide a leather coat
in the roof?

479
00:48:32,142 --> 00:48:34,007
Later that evening...

480
00:48:34,007 --> 00:48:36,408
as Liam was rowing home...

481
00:48:36,408 --> 00:48:39,811
he was followed by a solitary seal.

482
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:51,086
It seemed joyous in its movements.

483
00:48:51,086 --> 00:48:53,526
It rolled and dived within the waves...

484
00:48:53,526 --> 00:48:56,929
joyous in the sleekness of its body.

485
00:48:56,929 --> 00:49:00,935
Its eyes, as with all its kind...

486
00:49:00,935 --> 00:49:03,665
held a sadness as deep as the soul.

487
00:49:05,676 --> 00:49:08,201
When the seal left him at last...

488
00:49:08,201 --> 00:49:12,577
Liam felt a great emptiness inside
of fear!

489
00:49:12,577 --> 00:49:17,346
He rowed furious for the shore even
though the sea was heavy on his oars.

490
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:23,859
When he got home...

491
00:49:23,859 --> 00:49:27,293
it was the faces of his children
told him his fears were true.

492
00:49:29,533 --> 00:49:32,627
For once a selkie
finds its skin again...

493
00:49:32,627 --> 00:49:35,670
neither chains of steel
nor chains of love...

494
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:38,036
can keep her from the sea.

495
00:49:44,848 --> 00:49:47,214
From that day on...

496
00:49:47,214 --> 00:49:50,684
it was forbidden to harm a seal
on the island.

497
00:49:50,684 --> 00:49:55,758
And man and beast lived side by side,
sharing the wealth of the sea.

498
00:49:57,027 --> 00:49:59,996
And sometimes the Coneellys
would see her...

499
00:49:59,996 --> 00:50:02,223
out in the waves...

500
00:50:02,223 --> 00:50:05,392
basking in the sun on Trabeg...

501
00:50:05,392 --> 00:50:06,900
watching them...

502
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:10,403
watching her children.

503
00:50:10,403 --> 00:50:15,000
And the cradle was passed on
through the years...

504
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,309
with each new infant of the Coneellys
rocked upon the waves within it.

505
00:50:19,309 --> 00:50:21,349
And every so often...

506
00:50:21,349 --> 00:50:24,579
there'd be one born with the dark eyes
and black hair...

507
00:50:24,579 --> 00:50:27,918
that the selkie had left
in their blood.

508
00:50:27,918 --> 00:50:31,357
And these darks ones
were most at home at sea.

509
00:50:31,357 --> 00:50:35,056
Great sailors and fisher folk,
every one of them.

510
00:50:35,056 --> 00:50:38,395
Like Tadhg here.
He's an admiral in the Royal Navy.

511
00:50:38,395 --> 00:50:41,732
Fiona! Get out from there!
Your grandfather's ready.

512
00:50:43,673 --> 00:50:47,200
Welcome back, Fiona Coneelly.

513
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,313
We've been waitin'.

514
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:11,457
Is he mad?

515
00:51:11,457 --> 00:51:12,966
Tadhg.

516
00:51:13,837 --> 00:51:15,771
Oh, no, he's not mad.

517
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:20,067
A wee bit strange, maybe.
Always has been.

518
00:51:20,067 --> 00:51:24,738
He was a sailor for a little while.
Off to savage islands in the East.

519
00:51:24,738 --> 00:51:27,315
Places a Christian man
does well to avoid.

520
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:32,848
- Did he upset you?
- No. He was very pleasant.

521
00:51:34,324 --> 00:51:36,884
You're not to mind
anything he says to you.

522
00:51:36,884 --> 00:51:41,157
Poor fellow doesn't know
if he's wide awake or dreaming.

523
00:51:41,157 --> 00:51:44,529
Your grandfather and I have to go
to Kilmurry Banks tomorrow.

524
00:51:44,529 --> 00:51:46,533
To deal with the landlord.
Would you like to come?

525
00:51:46,533 --> 00:51:48,763
Or maybe go with Eamon?

526
00:51:48,763 --> 00:51:51,897
He has to deliver a parcel for
the postman among the smaller islands.

527
00:51:51,897 --> 00:51:54,772
I'd like to go with him.

528
00:51:54,772 --> 00:51:57,971
If the weather holds
and you dress warm.

529
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:03,609
He's a troubled soul,
Tadhg Coneelly.

530
00:52:03,609 --> 00:52:06,551
It's as if he's caught
between earth and water.

531
00:52:23,507 --> 00:52:27,705
And when the sun is just four fingers
above the horizon, you'll be waiting?

532
00:52:27,705 --> 00:52:29,243
I promise.

533
00:52:29,243 --> 00:52:31,244
And if the weather turns foul?

534
00:52:31,244 --> 00:52:34,578
I'll go into the cottage
and wait for you. I promise.

535
00:52:34,578 --> 00:52:37,915
- You remember where there's water?
- I do.

536
00:52:37,915 --> 00:52:40,420
If any harm comes to you,
they'll have me head.

537
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:43,526
- I'll be careful.
- All right then.

538
00:56:18,675 --> 00:56:19,395
Jamie!

539
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:34,489
Jamie, I found you at last!

540
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:54,242
Jamie! Come back to me!

541
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:16,127
- Right on time.
- I saw him today.

542
00:57:16,127 --> 00:57:18,995
- Saw who?
- Jamie.

543
00:57:18,995 --> 00:57:20,932
Sure you did.

544
00:57:20,932 --> 00:57:22,537
I did!

545
00:57:22,537 --> 00:57:24,935
I went into the cottage
and made a fire.

546
00:57:24,935 --> 00:57:27,474
I fell asleep and dreamed
of the selkie woman.

547
00:57:27,474 --> 00:57:30,010
When I woke, I climbed
to the top of the island.

548
00:57:30,010 --> 00:57:33,843
I saw that seal, the little one
that's been watchin' me.

549
00:57:33,843 --> 00:57:38,249
Then I was walkin', and he was there.
Jamie, pickin' flowers!

550
00:57:38,249 --> 00:57:41,857
But he ran from me. And before
I could reach him, he was gone.

551
00:57:41,857 --> 00:57:43,356
Gone where?

552
00:57:43,356 --> 00:57:47,326
In his cradle.
He sailed away around the rocks.

553
00:57:47,326 --> 00:57:49,226
There's talk of spirits here.

554
00:57:49,226 --> 00:57:53,563
He wasn't a spirit. He's a little boy.
I saw the flowers he pulled up.

555
00:57:53,563 --> 00:57:57,365
He dropped them when he ran.
Can a spirit do that?

556
00:57:57,365 --> 00:58:01,476
You've got to believe me.
I saw him.

557
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:08,076
I do believe you. But you mustn't tell
our grandparents about what happened.

558
00:58:08,076 --> 00:58:10,742
- You weren't supposed to be here.
- But if they knew?

559
00:58:10,742 --> 00:58:13,514
They'd think you were dreaming it all.

560
00:58:13,514 --> 00:58:16,386
Let me think about it.
We'll come up with a plan. Agreed?

561
00:58:16,386 --> 00:58:18,459
Agreed.

562
00:58:25,034 --> 00:58:26,968
Good evening, Grandfather.

563
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,234
Grandfather?

564
00:58:43,419 --> 00:58:44,750
What's wrong?

565
00:58:45,889 --> 00:58:48,449
Oh, there you are, dear.

566
00:58:48,449 --> 00:58:49,956
What is it?

567
00:58:51,127 --> 00:58:54,688
You know, we don't own this house.

568
00:58:54,688 --> 00:58:59,130
The landlord says he got a letter today
from some wealthy people overseas...

569
00:58:59,130 --> 00:59:01,930
who wants a place to summer in.

570
00:59:01,930 --> 00:59:04,972
"A gold mine," he called it.

571
00:59:04,972 --> 00:59:09,442
- Where will you go?
- Inland. Nothing is available here.

572
00:59:11,247 --> 00:59:14,580
It was bad enough your grandfather
having to come in off the island.

573
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:18,152
But to take him away from the sea.

574
00:59:18,152 --> 00:59:21,256
I'm fearin' his spirits will fail him.

575
00:59:21,256 --> 00:59:23,256
They can't do that.

576
00:59:23,256 --> 00:59:25,452
It isn't fair.

577
00:59:25,452 --> 00:59:27,687
It's the times, darlin'.

578
00:59:27,687 --> 00:59:31,766
After a war, people are always ready
to cut off the past and go forward.

579
00:59:33,436 --> 00:59:36,064
We're the ones left behind
is all.

580
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:43,307
That's not your worry, Fiona darlin'.

581
00:59:43,307 --> 00:59:47,313
Your shoulders is too narrow
to be carryin' all of that.

582
00:59:52,855 --> 00:59:54,789
It's not lifting at all.

583
00:59:54,789 --> 00:59:57,119
The mackerel won't see us comin', then.

584
00:59:58,161 --> 01:00:00,152
It's not fish I'm talkin' about.

585
01:00:00,152 --> 01:00:03,561
We can't take this wee one out
with dirty weather comin' up.

586
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:09,871
It'll clear, you'll see.

587
01:00:09,871 --> 01:00:12,007
You're an expert now, are ya?

588
01:00:12,007 --> 01:00:16,271
I'm sorry, but your grandmother would
never forgive me if you took a chill.

589
01:00:16,271 --> 01:00:19,142
You'll see naught but gray water
on a day like this.

590
01:00:19,142 --> 01:00:21,215
It's for the best.

591
01:00:23,419 --> 01:00:26,320
And be careful climbing up to the house.

592
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:36,621
Wait! Your sandwiches!

593
01:00:38,434 --> 01:00:39,799
Grandfather?

594
01:00:41,537 --> 01:00:42,902
Eamon?

595
01:00:59,756 --> 01:01:01,690
Is that you?

596
01:01:09,465 --> 01:01:11,330
Jax, I can't see you.

597
01:01:58,915 --> 01:02:01,406
Jax, is that you?

598
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:12,152
Are you still there?

599
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:29,777
Hello! Is anybody out there?

600
01:02:34,717 --> 01:02:36,548
What's happening?

601
01:02:38,554 --> 01:02:40,613
Where are we going?

602
01:04:11,113 --> 01:04:13,047
Won't you come ashore with me?

603
01:04:44,947 --> 01:04:46,812
Jamie!

604
01:04:50,987 --> 01:04:54,479
Jamie, it's me, Fiona.

605
01:07:54,603 --> 01:07:57,197
No, Jamie! Don't go!

606
01:07:57,197 --> 01:07:59,899
It's your sister!

607
01:08:20,463 --> 01:08:22,829
Why must you always run from me?

608
01:08:48,424 --> 01:08:52,053
I know you're out there,
and I know you can understand me.

609
01:08:52,053 --> 01:08:55,061
Give him back! Do you hear?
He's a little boy.

610
01:08:55,061 --> 01:08:57,358
He belongs with his family.

611
01:08:57,358 --> 01:09:02,369
I know you've taken care of him,
but he has to live with people now.

612
01:09:02,369 --> 01:09:06,134
I miss him so.
And so does Grandmother and Grandfather.

613
01:09:06,134 --> 01:09:09,267
And all the rest.
Miss him terrible.

614
01:09:10,846 --> 01:09:13,508
If we came back,
would you give him to us?

615
01:09:14,617 --> 01:09:18,678
If we came back here, to Roan Inish.
Is that what you want?

616
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:24,425
Are you still there?

617
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:28,294
That you, Fiona?

618
01:09:30,766 --> 01:09:32,324
We saw the fire.

619
01:09:32,324 --> 01:09:34,493
Grandfather!

620
01:09:49,485 --> 01:09:52,682
Christ Almighty, Fiona.
We were worried sick about you.

621
01:09:52,682 --> 01:09:54,686
I sat in the boat,
and it broke free.

622
01:09:54,686 --> 01:09:56,882
Seals came from out of the fog.

623
01:09:56,882 --> 01:09:59,859
And I looked and looked, but he wasn't
there. There was smoke in the chimney.

624
01:09:59,859 --> 01:10:04,830
Jamie was inside havin' tea with
a little seal, but then they ran away.

625
01:10:04,830 --> 01:10:07,561
She's gone crazy
with some kind of fever.

626
01:10:07,561 --> 01:10:09,398
I'm not sick!

627
01:10:09,398 --> 01:10:12,564
How did you get out here, then?
And slow this time.

628
01:10:12,564 --> 01:10:15,438
In the boat.
It drifted.

629
01:10:15,438 --> 01:10:19,241
There's no oars in it.
And look at this.

630
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:23,617
He set a table inside with shells.
You can see it.

631
01:10:24,787 --> 01:10:27,221
Someone's playin' tricks on us,
and it might be you.

632
01:10:27,221 --> 01:10:29,221
I don't lie.

633
01:10:29,221 --> 01:10:30,848
I believe her.

634
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:36,091
It's the madness
that runs in the family.

635
01:10:36,091 --> 01:10:38,700
He's in the cradle,
and there's always seals about.

636
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:42,565
That's from talkin' to Tadhg, isn't it?
He put all this into your head.

637
01:10:42,565 --> 01:10:45,037
- But, Grandfather...
- Not another word.

638
01:10:45,037 --> 01:10:47,369
Get in that curragh.

639
01:10:47,369 --> 01:10:51,138
I need silence to think up
some likely excuse for your grandmother.

640
01:10:58,687 --> 01:11:00,746
Ah, seals indeed!

641
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:13,493
- Good mornin' to ya.
- Good mornin'.

642
01:11:13,493 --> 01:11:15,627
Where's Grandfather?

643
01:11:15,627 --> 01:11:18,035
He's already into the pub this mornin'.

644
01:11:18,035 --> 01:11:21,939
And he'll be less likely to come out
as it was a black mood he left with.

645
01:11:21,939 --> 01:11:25,945
I gave him hard with my tongue
for takin' you out yesterday.

646
01:11:25,945 --> 01:11:27,946
Nothing bad happened.

647
01:11:30,019 --> 01:11:32,146
Is Eamon going out
in the motor boat today?

648
01:11:32,146 --> 01:11:34,779
It doesn't matter whether he is.
You're not goin' with him.

649
01:11:36,225 --> 01:11:40,218
There's no need of the bleak ocean
for catchin' a dose of fresh air.

650
01:11:40,218 --> 01:11:43,263
One day ashore won't kill you,
will it?

651
01:11:43,263 --> 01:11:45,663
No, ma'am.

652
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:46,025
Hello.

653
01:12:48,564 --> 01:12:51,328
- Have you seen him?
- Why does he run from me?

654
01:12:52,768 --> 01:12:56,602
- Why do you chase him?
- He's my brother. He's lost.

655
01:12:56,602 --> 01:13:02,075
He isn't lost at all. He's just
with another branch of the family.

656
01:13:04,179 --> 01:13:08,172
- Why look at me like that?
- Don't know whether to believe you.

657
01:13:08,172 --> 01:13:10,182
People say you're daft.

658
01:13:12,154 --> 01:13:14,019
They have their reason.

659
01:13:14,019 --> 01:13:17,557
Have you ever seen him?
Have you ever seen Jamie?

660
01:13:17,557 --> 01:13:19,593
I may be daft, girl...

661
01:13:21,864 --> 01:13:23,729
but I'm not blind.

662
01:13:44,787 --> 01:13:46,812
- Fisherman's bend.
- Right.

663
01:13:46,812 --> 01:13:48,820
We've got to get them to move back.

664
01:13:48,820 --> 01:13:51,050
I don't see how.

665
01:13:51,050 --> 01:13:52,888
They're going to lose their house.

666
01:13:52,888 --> 01:13:55,292
Nobody's been on the island for years.

667
01:13:55,292 --> 01:13:58,491
It's derelict with weeds,
the cottages is fallen to ruin.

668
01:13:58,491 --> 01:14:01,364
Bowline. The cottages aren't so bad.

669
01:14:01,364 --> 01:14:04,995
I've been in them. Didn't you say
you planned to move back?

670
01:14:04,995 --> 01:14:06,573
When I'm a man.

671
01:14:06,573 --> 01:14:09,609
What's to stop you now?

672
01:14:09,609 --> 01:14:12,270
Grandmother will be the hard nugget.

673
01:14:12,270 --> 01:14:15,577
She worries awful
about Grandfather's health.

674
01:14:15,577 --> 01:14:16,911
Carrick bend.

675
01:14:16,911 --> 01:14:20,920
She'd move back forJamie, though.
In a minute she would.

676
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:23,581
Them that's caring for him
won't let him back...

677
01:14:23,581 --> 01:14:26,353
until they see we've returned,
I'm sure of it.

678
01:14:26,353 --> 01:14:31,091
- You've been speaking with the seals?
- We could start fixing the cottages.

679
01:14:31,091 --> 01:14:33,861
What do you think?

680
01:14:33,861 --> 01:14:37,870
- I'll meet you here in the mornin'.
- I'll say we're off digging clams.

681
01:14:37,870 --> 01:14:40,270
Pull this for a deal.

682
01:14:40,270 --> 01:14:41,774
Granny's knot.

683
01:14:51,854 --> 01:14:53,719
Help me with this.

684
01:15:05,734 --> 01:15:07,668
Look at that, will ya?

685
01:15:07,668 --> 01:15:09,998
It's all our food floatin' away.

686
01:15:11,006 --> 01:15:12,997
We could row after it.

687
01:15:12,997 --> 01:15:17,077
Not without losing half a day
in the chase. Come on, then.

688
01:18:20,629 --> 01:18:22,494
Look.

689
01:18:43,251 --> 01:18:46,709
It could've tipped in the waves
and all spilt out.

690
01:18:46,709 --> 01:18:48,720
Do you think that's what happened?

691
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:56,595
Not for a moment.

692
01:19:00,969 --> 01:19:04,405
- How did the mussel gathering go?
- We worked wonders with them.

693
01:19:04,405 --> 01:19:06,700
- Didn't we, Fiona?
- It was hard work.

694
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:08,901
Be careful not to overtax yourself.

695
01:19:08,901 --> 01:19:12,070
I won't. It's good for me.
Look at my muscles.

696
01:19:12,070 --> 01:19:15,081
It's improved your appetite anyway.

697
01:19:15,081 --> 01:19:18,448
You came in here as though
the hunger of the world was on you.

698
01:22:48,863 --> 01:22:51,627
We should plant some things up here.

699
01:22:51,627 --> 01:22:54,667
When we move back,
there'll be time.

700
01:22:54,667 --> 01:22:57,670
We'd better start back.
The tide won't wait.

701
01:23:50,525 --> 01:23:51,890
Mother?

702
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:07,505
Your mother is it?

703
01:24:07,505 --> 01:24:11,442
- Where did she come from?
- Hasn't your father told you that?

704
01:24:11,442 --> 01:24:13,604
He doesn't like to speak of her.

705
01:24:15,784 --> 01:24:19,276
She came from Balleybofey
back in the mainland.

706
01:24:19,276 --> 01:24:22,913
Traveling the hills in search of a meal
and a place to sleep.

707
01:24:24,092 --> 01:24:25,787
They was poor.

708
01:24:25,787 --> 01:24:29,021
Her father with no livelihood,
only his day's pay.

709
01:24:29,021 --> 01:24:31,564
Seldom he had even that.

710
01:24:31,564 --> 01:24:33,963
They say the only true wealth
is land.

711
01:24:33,963 --> 01:24:36,263
Like we own in Roan Inish.

712
01:24:36,263 --> 01:24:40,101
- For all the good it does us.
- Quiet, Hugh.

713
01:24:40,101 --> 01:24:43,836
Jimmy, your father, was me youngest,
and the dearest of me heart.

714
01:24:43,836 --> 01:24:46,412
Oh, but he was an airy boy.

715
01:24:46,412 --> 01:24:51,178
Bone lazy at times, and at others you'd
never find a worker as keen as him.

716
01:24:51,178 --> 01:24:55,312
Like night and day he was,
depending on the mood that struck him.

717
01:24:55,312 --> 01:24:57,425
Can't put a wise head
on a young body.

718
01:24:57,425 --> 01:25:01,427
She was in Donegal town for
the pilgrimage on St. Brigid's day...

719
01:25:01,427 --> 01:25:03,497
which was her namesake.

720
01:25:03,497 --> 01:25:05,622
Sixteen years of age.

721
01:25:05,622 --> 01:25:08,235
Beautiful, strong Christian girl.

722
01:25:08,235 --> 01:25:11,497
Sun or stars never shone
on a better one.

723
01:25:11,497 --> 01:25:15,268
I loved her like a daughter,
our Brigid.

724
01:25:15,268 --> 01:25:19,369
- And Father was there?
- We'd a run on mackerel that year.

725
01:25:19,369 --> 01:25:22,745
A great patch of them
shoaling up behind the island.

726
01:25:22,745 --> 01:25:26,786
Our men were barely able to dip
their nets in the water fast enough.

727
01:25:26,786 --> 01:25:30,084
Your father and Matt Margonn
had gone off to the mainland...

728
01:25:30,084 --> 01:25:32,090
to sell what they had left over.

729
01:25:32,090 --> 01:25:35,162
First time he laid eyes on Brigid
she was leaving the church.

730
01:25:35,162 --> 01:25:38,026
He was struck speechless
with the sight of her.

731
01:25:38,026 --> 01:25:42,193
It was the shyness of an island boy,
and she wasn't a worldly girl at all.

732
01:25:42,193 --> 01:25:45,170
But toJimmy,
anyplace off of Roan Inish...

733
01:25:45,170 --> 01:25:47,934
might have been Paris, France.

734
01:25:47,934 --> 01:25:51,568
So there he is, making honey
in his heart of her good looks.

735
01:25:51,568 --> 01:25:53,681
Meanwhile, she's just as struck.

736
01:25:53,681 --> 01:25:58,218
With him a big, handsome, powerful lad,
with eyes that melted all the girls.

737
01:25:58,218 --> 01:26:02,687
And she's in a hundred pieces,
wondering what she could do to meet him.

738
01:26:02,687 --> 01:26:05,793
Did he speak to her?
What did he say?

739
01:26:05,793 --> 01:26:07,986
"Would you like to buy some fish, miss?"

740
01:26:09,764 --> 01:26:12,198
She said she'd love to.
She'd never tasted fish...

741
01:26:12,198 --> 01:26:14,824
from the salty ocean
in all her life.

742
01:26:14,824 --> 01:26:18,132
But she hadn't a shilling to her name
to buy it with.

743
01:26:18,132 --> 01:26:22,403
They fell into talking,
great with each other immediately...

744
01:26:22,403 --> 01:26:24,171
as happens with the young.

745
01:26:24,171 --> 01:26:27,975
I remember the day she came.
Sittin' in the back of the curragh.

746
01:26:27,975 --> 01:26:33,452
I says to Tess, " Look at the prize
Matt Margonn brought from Donegal."

747
01:26:33,452 --> 01:26:38,025
"No," she says, "for look how Matt's got
his eyes straight ahead at the island.

748
01:26:38,025 --> 01:26:40,855
OurJimmy is rowing,
so he won't let her out of his sight."

749
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:45,090
From that day, Jim had the name
of a steady husband...

750
01:26:45,090 --> 01:26:47,326
and a hard worker.

751
01:26:47,326 --> 01:26:50,369
As fine as any that ever broke bread.

752
01:26:52,574 --> 01:26:56,066
She grew to love the island,
our Brigid.

753
01:26:56,066 --> 01:26:58,577
She was the last one to marry
on to Roan Inish.

754
01:27:00,215 --> 01:27:02,581
And the last one to die in it.

755
01:27:04,385 --> 01:27:07,718
He always blamed himself...

756
01:27:07,718 --> 01:27:10,050
for bringin' her into
the life of the sea.

757
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:14,353
But life can be hard
on the mainland, too.

758
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:21,365
Your hands is gettin' rough.

759
01:27:23,171 --> 01:27:25,969
It's pulling mussels
that does it.

760
01:27:27,842 --> 01:27:32,541
Look at them clouds.
Gathering for a right blow tonight.

761
01:27:32,541 --> 01:27:37,413
It's going to be hell's own fury
for any creature caught without shelter.

762
01:27:37,413 --> 01:27:41,283
- HopeJamie comes in.
- What was that you were sayin'?

763
01:27:43,825 --> 01:27:46,919
I said I hopeJamie comes in
out of the storm.

764
01:27:46,919 --> 01:27:50,497
- What can you mean?
- I've seen him, Grandmother.

765
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:54,395
She just dreamed him up
sleeping one day on Roan Inish.

766
01:27:54,395 --> 01:27:56,400
A wish can be a powerful thing.

767
01:27:56,400 --> 01:28:00,337
I saw him. Once on a hillside
picking flowers...

768
01:28:00,337 --> 01:28:02,966
and once in the cottage
having tea with a seal.

769
01:28:05,213 --> 01:28:09,650
I'm not imagining it. I've seen him.
He was without a stitch.

770
01:28:09,650 --> 01:28:12,309
Then he nipped away
in his little cradle boat.

771
01:28:12,309 --> 01:28:14,683
The seals have been lookin' after him.

772
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:20,855
- The seals, is it?
- It's the truth, Grandmother.

773
01:28:28,236 --> 01:28:29,931
It is.

774
01:28:34,075 --> 01:28:35,440
Oh, dear.

775
01:28:41,182 --> 01:28:45,050
There's a box of biscuits on the shelf.
Will you get it down for me?

776
01:28:45,050 --> 01:28:46,813
Tess?

777
01:28:46,813 --> 01:28:49,821
Put the chickens in their coop
like a good girl.

778
01:28:49,821 --> 01:28:52,858
- Is she all right?
- What have you got?

779
01:28:52,858 --> 01:28:56,054
You don't want to sleep out
on the cold ground, do you?

780
01:28:56,054 --> 01:28:57,630
Look at that sky.

781
01:28:57,630 --> 01:29:00,928
I can read a sky as well as you.
There's a storm comin'.

782
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:04,129
And it's no weather to be leavin'
a small boy outside in.

783
01:29:07,275 --> 01:29:09,835
I knew he wasn't gone from us.

784
01:29:09,835 --> 01:29:12,969
Holy Mother,
I felt it all along.

785
01:29:12,969 --> 01:29:16,413
Hurry on, will ya?
I'll get the lantern.

786
01:29:17,919 --> 01:29:21,218
And they say the Coneellys
is the mad ones.

787
01:30:20,515 --> 01:30:22,380
Mind the bedding, Eamon.

788
01:30:22,380 --> 01:30:25,918
It'll be damp enough in those wraps
without a dousing of seawater.

789
01:30:34,228 --> 01:30:36,093
What are you staring at now?

790
01:30:42,203 --> 01:30:44,194
Where's that Fiona got to?

791
01:30:44,194 --> 01:30:46,738
I need her to help gather seaweed
for soup.

792
01:30:46,738 --> 01:30:50,241
Tess, look what they've done.

793
01:30:56,417 --> 01:30:59,443
Bless us, sweetJesus.

794
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:14,424
Now this is a soup as only the women
of Roan Inish know how to make.

795
01:31:14,424 --> 01:31:17,037
She learned it from my mother,
Lord be good to her.

796
01:31:17,037 --> 01:31:20,868
Who got it from hers, who got it
from hers before that again.

797
01:31:22,143 --> 01:31:25,635
All the way back
to the first Coneellys.

798
01:31:26,948 --> 01:31:29,473
They learned it from the dark woman,
from Nuala.

799
01:31:33,621 --> 01:31:36,181
Some tell it like that. Yes.

800
01:31:37,725 --> 01:31:39,590
When you're out in dirty weather...

801
01:31:39,590 --> 01:31:43,060
it's like the lifeblood
flowin' back into your veins.

802
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:50,528
- It's part of the backbone of a whale.
- Jamie brought it in.

803
01:31:53,307 --> 01:31:54,672
Well.

804
01:31:58,446 --> 01:32:00,812
You young ones did a great job
on this thatching.

805
01:32:03,084 --> 01:32:06,053
It'll have its test
in a few minutes.

806
01:32:06,053 --> 01:32:08,553
- It's a south wind, Grandfather.
- Aye.

807
01:32:08,553 --> 01:32:11,487
They're often the most fearsome.

808
01:32:14,228 --> 01:32:15,593
Jamie.

809
01:32:16,731 --> 01:32:18,596
Poor little soul.

810
01:32:49,931 --> 01:32:51,296
It's the little seal.

811
01:33:13,454 --> 01:33:15,285
Do you feel it?

812
01:33:16,257 --> 01:33:19,226
- Like snuffin' out a candle.
- Look!

813
01:33:36,844 --> 01:33:38,175
Jamie!

814
01:33:42,383 --> 01:33:45,750
Jamie, it's me, Fiona.
We've come back for you.

815
01:33:49,023 --> 01:33:52,186
No, Jamie, don't go.
It's your family here.

816
01:33:59,700 --> 01:34:01,964
Don't frighten him, dear.

817
01:34:33,134 --> 01:34:35,830
Heavenly Father, look at that!
They're telling him to stay.

818
01:34:35,830 --> 01:34:38,904
But he's afraid.
He's so afraid.

819
01:34:50,518 --> 01:34:52,042
Come on, Jamie boy.

820
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:42,735
There you go, love.

821
01:35:54,849 --> 01:35:56,749
We'll be staying here now.

822
01:35:58,285 --> 01:35:59,616
Thank you.

823
01:36:25,546 --> 01:36:29,141
Lord love his little heart.
He's hungry.

824
01:36:31,352 --> 01:36:34,321
How did you live out there?
What did you eat?

825
01:36:34,321 --> 01:36:36,251
I wouldn't think
he could answer.

826
01:36:36,251 --> 01:36:39,051
I'll teach you to talk,
and I'll tell you stories.

827
01:36:39,051 --> 01:36:43,754
Your friends who have been looking after
you can see you any time they like.

828
01:36:43,754 --> 01:36:46,126
Fiona's to thank
for finding you, Jamie boy.

829
01:36:46,126 --> 01:36:48,165
She gave me her word.

830
01:36:48,165 --> 01:36:50,793
I just wouldn't believe it.
Will you look at us?

831
01:36:50,793 --> 01:36:53,132
Back in Roan Inish.

832
01:36:54,909 --> 01:36:59,005
It's like breathing fresh air
after being three years on the ground.

833
01:36:59,005 --> 01:37:01,478
Do you remember me,
your sister Fiona?

834
01:37:04,952 --> 01:37:06,317
Fiona.

835
01:37:09,456 --> 01:37:11,390
He's destroyed with the excitement.

836
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:15,788
At least he'll sleep warm tonight.
