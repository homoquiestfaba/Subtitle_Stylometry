some numbers with me.

00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:41,919
Casey comes and he asks
if I wanna go over the numbers,

702
00:28:41,921 --> 00:28:43,153

703
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:45,155
"Can we go sneak out
and get some coffee."

I was, like, a hindrance.

- It's what you are.

get started on that.

about various aspects

of Panda Bites.

797
00:32:46,432 --> 00:32:48,598

is that our, our target demo

00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,001
is 18 to 35.

00:32:51,003 --> 00:32:53,003

they try to avoid
making eye contact with people.

00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,178
Most of them would have bought
tickets to the Fyre Festival,

805

very upset when they found out

wasn't actually something.

My grandpa and his friends

They eat them, like,
three times a day.

00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:40,650
Um, so I thought, I don't know,
maybe we could ask them why.

820

that's not being accurately...

- [CONNOR] No, look.

I think what Connor
is trying to say,

827
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:04,775
is that Panda Bites
isn't performing.
