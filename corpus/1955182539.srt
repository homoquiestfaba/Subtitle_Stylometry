Thank you very much.

Thank you very much.

Hello.

Yeah!

Nice to see you.

14
00:00:49,499 --> 00:00:50,498
Yeah!

15
00:00:50,499 --> 00:00:52,498
Okay, you guys feeling good?
Yeah?

16
00:00:52,499 --> 00:00:54,498
[cheers and applause]

17
00:00:54,499 --> 00:00:55,498
That's good.
That's good, yeah.

18
00:00:55,499 --> 00:00:57,498
Whoo-hoo, whoo-hoo to you too.
- Whoo!

19
00:00:57,499 --> 00:00:59,498
- And that as well, ma'am.
And that as well.

20
00:00:59,499 --> 00:01:01,498
I love that.
I love the sounds people make.

21
00:01:01,499 --> 00:01:03,498
It's so much fun, yeah.

22
00:01:03,499 --> 00:01:04,498
We're just--we're just throwing
language out of the window.

23
00:01:04,499 --> 00:01:06,498
I like that.

24
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:08,498
I feel like we're devolving
as human beings now.

25
00:01:08,499 --> 00:01:10,659
No, 'cause that was the thing
that separated us from the apes,

26
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,498
wasn't it?
The fact that we chose speech.

27
00:01:13,499 --> 00:01:14,498
Yeah.

28
00:01:14,499 --> 00:01:16,498
The monkeys used to run around
and screech.

29
00:01:16,499 --> 00:01:18,498
[screeching]

30
00:01:18,499 --> 00:01:22,498
And we were like, "No."

31
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:23,498
English.

32
00:01:23,499 --> 00:01:26,498
[laughter]

33
00:01:26,499 --> 00:01:27,498
But now, we've started
to go back to that,

34
00:01:27,499 --> 00:01:29,498
started to embrace our roots.

35
00:01:29,499 --> 00:01:31,498
People get excited,
"Are you happy?"

36
00:01:31,499 --> 00:01:33,498
"I'm real happy."
"How happy?"

37
00:01:33,499 --> 00:01:34,498
"Whoo-hoo, whoo-hoo!

38
00:01:34,499 --> 00:01:36,498
"Whoo-hoo!

39
00:01:36,499 --> 00:01:39,498
"Whoo! Whoo!

40
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:41,498
Whoo! Ow!"

41
00:01:41,499 --> 00:01:43,498
That's one of
my favorite sounds.

42
00:01:43,499 --> 00:01:45,498
It sounds like
someone's having so much fun

43
00:01:45,499 --> 00:01:46,498
they hurt themselves.

44
00:01:46,499 --> 00:01:47,498
Like you didn't plan
ahead of time.

45
00:01:47,499 --> 00:01:48,498
[screeches]

46
00:01:48,499 --> 00:01:52,498
Ow!
Too much fun.

47
00:01:52,499 --> 00:01:53,498
Such a weird sound.
I love it.

48
00:01:53,499 --> 00:01:55,498
And you know what's crazy is

49
00:01:55,499 --> 00:01:56,498
that we all know
what that sound means.

50
00:01:56,499 --> 00:01:58,498
We don't agree on anything
in this world--

51
00:01:58,499 --> 00:02:01,498
race, religion, politics--

52
00:02:01,499 --> 00:02:04,498
but that sound, that "whoo-hoo,"

53
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:07,498
has united us all.

54
00:02:07,499 --> 00:02:09,498
You can make that sound anywhere

55
00:02:09,499 --> 00:02:10,498
and people accept it.

56
00:02:10,499 --> 00:02:13,498
As long as there's alcohol
present,

57
00:02:13,499 --> 00:02:14,498
you can make that sound.

58
00:02:14,499 --> 00:02:15,498
Whoo-hoo!

59
00:02:15,499 --> 00:02:16,498
But there has to be alcohol.

60
00:02:16,499 --> 00:02:18,498
You can't make that sound
anywhere else.

61
00:02:18,499 --> 00:02:19,498
You can't make that sound
in the office.

62
00:02:19,499 --> 00:02:20,819
It's unacceptable.

63
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,498
Your boss won't allow it.

64
00:02:22,499 --> 00:02:23,498
You can't be like, "Final email.
Sent.

65
00:02:23,499 --> 00:02:24,498
Whoo-hoo!"

66
00:02:24,499 --> 00:02:28,498
"Johnson!"
"Sorry, sir. Sorry, sorry."

67
00:02:28,499 --> 00:02:29,498
Can't make that sound in church.

68
00:02:29,499 --> 00:02:34,339
"And that is why Jesus died
for our sins."

69
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,498
"Whoo-hoo!"

70
00:02:36,499 --> 00:02:37,498
"Sorry, pastor."

71
00:02:37,499 --> 00:02:38,498
"Go to hell."

72
00:02:38,499 --> 00:02:39,498
You just can't do it,

73
00:02:39,499 --> 00:02:41,498
but everyone knows it.

74
00:02:41,499 --> 00:02:42,498
Everyone knows
what "whoo-hoo" means.

75
00:02:42,499 --> 00:02:44,498
It means happiness, yeah.

76
00:02:44,499 --> 00:02:46,498
The happiness of the people.

77
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:49,498
Strange, because no one asked me
to vote on it.

78
00:02:49,499 --> 00:02:52,498
I didn't get to choose.

79
00:02:52,499 --> 00:02:53,498
If I was to choose,

80
00:02:53,499 --> 00:02:55,498
I don't know that I would pick
"whoo-hoo"

81
00:02:55,499 --> 00:02:57,498
as the sound of happiness.

82
00:02:57,499 --> 00:02:59,498
Strangely enough,
I think it may be more apt

83
00:02:59,499 --> 00:03:01,498
as the sound of sadness.

84
00:03:01,499 --> 00:03:03,498
I could see it,
at a funeral.

85
00:03:03,499 --> 00:03:06,498
Family gathered around
the caskets.

86
00:03:06,499 --> 00:03:08,498
Tears streaming down their face.

Such a fun sound.

00:04:00,499 --> 00:04:01,498
The sound of happiness.

108
00:04:01,499 --> 00:04:04,498
The sound of white happiness,
in particular.

109
00:04:04,499 --> 00:04:06,498
Yeah.
I've tracked it.

110
00:04:06,499 --> 00:04:07,498
I've searched for the source
of whoo-hoo

111
00:04:07,499 --> 00:04:11,498
and I found it originated
with white people.

112
00:04:11,499 --> 00:04:13,498
White--white woman
in particular.

113
00:04:13,499 --> 00:04:14,498
Yeah, that's where
it comes from.

114
00:04:14,499 --> 00:04:17,498
That is the sound
of a white woman's turnup.

115
00:04:17,499 --> 00:04:20,498
That is the sound
of her getting into the game.

116
00:04:20,499 --> 00:04:24,498
It's like,
"Tammy! Whoo-hoo!"

117
00:04:24,499 --> 00:04:26,498
And that's where you know
it's on.

118
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:29,498
Yeah, 'cause everyone else
learned it from a white woman.

119
00:04:29,499 --> 00:04:30,498
That's where it came from,
you know?

120
00:04:30,499 --> 00:04:33,498
It spread through society
like a virus.

121
00:04:33,499 --> 00:04:34,498
It's not the natural sound
anybody else makes.

122
00:04:34,499 --> 00:04:35,498
White women make that sound
instinctively,

123
00:04:35,499 --> 00:04:37,498
but everyone else
has learned it.

124
00:04:37,499 --> 00:04:38,498
Like, white men were
the first ones to learn it,

125
00:04:38,499 --> 00:04:40,498
because for them,
it's sort of like a mating call.

126
00:04:40,499 --> 00:04:41,498
They know what it means.

127
00:04:41,499 --> 00:04:43,498
They have to reciprocate,
like, "Whoo-hoo!"

128
00:04:43,499 --> 00:04:46,498
"Whoo-hoo!"

129
00:04:46,499 --> 00:04:48,498
But everyone else
had to learn it.

130
00:04:48,499 --> 00:04:50,498
It's a natural sound for them
but for nobody else.

131
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:53,498
Like, black people whoo-hoo
but it's not the natural sound

132
00:04:53,499 --> 00:04:54,498
black people make for fun,
you know?

133
00:04:54,499 --> 00:04:56,498
Black people can whoo-hoo.
Black people often do whoo-hoo,

134
00:04:56,499 --> 00:05:00,498
but it's not instinctively
a black sound of happiness.

135
00:05:00,499 --> 00:05:02,498
And I think it's because
black people aren't comfortable

136
00:05:02,499 --> 00:05:04,498
with the whoo-hoo.

137
00:05:04,499 --> 00:05:07,498
Deep down inside there's
a certain moment in whoo-hoo

138
00:05:07,499 --> 00:05:09,498
when every black person
stops enjoying it.

139
00:05:09,499 --> 00:05:12,498
There's just--
there's just a moment

140
00:05:12,499 --> 00:05:15,498
when--and maybe this is just
my personal experiences,

141
00:05:15,499 --> 00:05:18,498
but I fear it sounds eerily
similar to a police siren.

142
00:05:18,499 --> 00:05:22,498
There's just a moment
where it stops being fun.

143
00:05:22,499 --> 00:05:25,498
[cheers and applause]

144
00:05:25,499 --> 00:05:26,498
There's just that split second

145
00:05:26,499 --> 00:05:28,498
where it's like,
"Whoo-hoo, whoo!

146
00:05:28,499 --> 00:05:31,498
"Whoo, whoo, whoop-whoop, whoo.

147
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:35,498
Whoop. Whoop. Boop."

148
00:05:35,499 --> 00:05:38,498
[laughter]

149
00:05:38,499 --> 00:05:40,498
Put your hands in the air...

150
00:05:40,499 --> 00:05:42,498
and keep them there.

151
00:05:42,499 --> 00:05:46,498
It's not the sound of happiness
in my life, that's not--

152
00:05:46,499 --> 00:05:47,498
Although, I guess that's why
white people do it.

153
00:05:47,499 --> 00:05:49,498
'Cause white people
love calling the police,

154
00:05:49,499 --> 00:05:50,498
so they're probably like,
"Whoo-hoo!

155
00:05:50,499 --> 00:05:53,498
"Oh, my God,
the cops are here!

156
00:05:53,499 --> 00:05:55,498
"Party time!

157
00:05:55,499 --> 00:05:57,498
Come on in.
I thought you'd never make it."

158
00:05:57,499 --> 00:05:59,498
'Cause white people do,
white people have

159
00:05:59,499 --> 00:06:01,498
a very different relationship
with the police.

160
00:06:01,499 --> 00:06:03,498
I was trying to explain this
to my friend, Dave.

161
00:06:03,499 --> 00:06:04,498
You know, when we're hanging out
he's like,

162
00:06:04,499 --> 00:06:07,498
"Dude, what is it
with black people and police?"

163
00:06:07,499 --> 00:06:08,498
I'm like, "It's not that black
people don't like the police

164
00:06:08,499 --> 00:06:10,498
or hate the police,
it's just that--it's just that

165
00:06:10,499 --> 00:06:12,498
we have a tumultuous history
with the police."

166
00:06:12,499 --> 00:06:14,498
One day we were driving--
we're driving on the highway

167
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,498
and the police car
pulled up behind us

168
00:06:16,499 --> 00:06:18,498
and I got tense.
I just got really tense.

169
00:06:18,499 --> 00:06:20,498
And he's like,
"Dude, what's going on?"

170
00:06:20,499 --> 00:06:22,498
I said, "The police.
The police are behind us."

171
00:06:22,499 --> 00:06:24,498
He was like, "Yeah, and?
Did you do anything wrong?"

172
00:06:24,499 --> 00:06:28,498
I said,
"That's not the point."

173
00:06:28,499 --> 00:06:30,498
Because it really isn't.

174
00:06:30,499 --> 00:06:32,498
For white people,
that is the point.

175
00:06:32,499 --> 00:06:34,498
The police will send you to jail
if you do something wrong.

176
00:06:34,499 --> 00:06:36,498
As a black person, you have
a different relationship.

177
00:06:36,499 --> 00:06:40,498
The police may send you to jail
just because.

178
00:06:40,499 --> 00:06:42,498
I know this because I was--
I was driving--

179
00:06:42,499 --> 00:06:43,498
I got pulled over by the police
for the first time

180
00:06:43,499 --> 00:06:45,498
in my life in America.

181
00:06:45,499 --> 00:06:46,498
And already, I'm not
very comfortable when driving

182
00:06:46,499 --> 00:06:48,498
in the United States, you know.

183
00:06:48,499 --> 00:06:50,498
Not because it's the other side
of the road,

184
00:06:50,499 --> 00:06:52,498
but because it's
the other side of the car.

185
00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:53,498
I'm not used to that, you know.

186
00:06:53,499 --> 00:06:56,498
Like--like, I always get into
the car on the wrong side.

187
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,498
I'll be shopping and I'll come
back to my car confidently,

188
00:06:58,499 --> 00:07:00,498
and I'll jump inside
and put the things down,

189
00:07:00,499 --> 00:07:03,419
and then I'm like, "Ah."

190
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,498
[laughter]

191
00:07:05,499 --> 00:07:07,498
And then instead of getting out,
I sit there.

192
00:07:07,499 --> 00:07:08,498
I always just sit there,

193
00:07:08,499 --> 00:07:10,498
because I always think
somebody's watching me.

194
00:07:10,499 --> 00:07:15,498
So I just sit there and I act
like I planned it all, like...

195
00:07:15,499 --> 00:07:17,498
"Where is my driver?"

196
00:07:17,499 --> 00:07:19,498
[laughter]

197
00:07:19,499 --> 00:07:21,498
"Where is my--
He should have been here by now.

198
00:07:21,499 --> 00:07:24,498
Where is my--Oh, well,
I guess I'll drive myself."

199
00:07:24,499 --> 00:07:26,498
[laughter]

200
00:07:26,499 --> 00:07:30,498
I don't know why I do that.
I'm not comfortable.

201
00:07:30,499 --> 00:07:32,498
But you have to drive
in Los Angeles.

202
00:07:32,499 --> 00:07:35,498
So I had a little rental car
and I'm driving on the freeway

203
00:07:35,499 --> 00:07:38,498
and this police car
pulls up behind me.

204
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:39,498
And he drives behind me
for a little bit

205
00:07:39,499 --> 00:07:41,498
and then he flashes his lights.

206
00:07:41,499 --> 00:07:42,498
And I was like, "Oh,
he probably wants to go past."

207
00:07:42,499 --> 00:07:44,498
And so I moved over
to the middle lane

208
00:07:44,499 --> 00:07:47,498
and then he came with me
and he flashed his lights again.

209
00:07:47,499 --> 00:07:49,498
And I was like, "Oh, come on,
just go past me, man.

210
00:07:49,499 --> 00:07:51,498
Just go past me, man."

211
00:07:51,499 --> 00:07:52,498
And I went back to the fast
lane, he came back with me.

212
00:07:52,499 --> 00:07:54,498
And he hit--flash the lights,
and this time it was like,

213
00:07:54,499 --> 00:07:56,498
whoop, whoop, whoop,
whoop, whoop.

214
00:07:56,499 --> 00:07:58,498
And I was like, "Yeah, go past.
You keep coming with me.

215
00:07:58,499 --> 00:08:00,498
Go past." 'Cause I didn't think
he was stopping me.

216
00:08:00,499 --> 00:08:01,498
I thought it was basically
the vehicular equivalent

217
00:08:01,499 --> 00:08:03,498
of that moment on the sidewalk
when you both don't know

218
00:08:03,499 --> 00:08:04,498
which way to go.

219
00:08:04,499 --> 00:08:06,498
I thought we were doing that
with our cars,

220
00:08:06,499 --> 00:08:09,498
like, "Oh, oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, all right. Ahh."

221
00:08:09,499 --> 00:08:11,498
I thought that was happening.
I thought that was happening.

222
00:08:11,499 --> 00:08:13,498
And clearly he thought
that I was evading him

223
00:08:13,499 --> 00:08:15,498
in the most polite manner ever,
because he gets irritated,

224
00:08:15,499 --> 00:08:17,498
and he's like, "Pull over
to the side of the road, sir."

225
00:08:17,499 --> 00:08:18,498
Whoop, whoop.

226
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:20,498
"Pull over
to the side of the road now."

227
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:22,498
Now, I couldn't hear
what the hell he was saying.

228
00:08:22,499 --> 00:08:23,498
I'm not gonna--Which I think
is part of the problem.

229
00:08:23,499 --> 00:08:25,498
I don't think it's fair
that police have speakers

230
00:08:25,499 --> 00:08:27,498
on their cars and we don't.

231
00:08:27,499 --> 00:08:29,498
I think this is
a recipe for disaster.

232
00:08:29,499 --> 00:08:31,498
That's the first step

233
00:08:31,499 --> 00:08:33,498
in mending relationships
is communication, people.

234
00:08:33,499 --> 00:08:34,498
I don't know what the hell
that guy was saying,

235
00:08:34,499 --> 00:08:36,498
but I couldn't tell him.
He was like,

236
00:08:36,499 --> 00:08:38,498
"Pull over to the side of the
road [indistinct mumbling]."

237
00:08:38,499 --> 00:08:40,498
If I had a speaker, I would have
had the ability to be like,

238
00:08:40,499 --> 00:08:41,498
"Sir, I cannot hear
what you're saying.

239
00:08:41,499 --> 00:08:43,498
"Enunciate your words, please.

240
00:08:43,499 --> 00:08:47,498
Enunciate your words.
Speak clearly."

241
00:08:47,499 --> 00:08:49,498
"I said, pull over [mumbles]."

242
00:08:49,499 --> 00:08:50,498
Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.

243
00:08:50,499 --> 00:08:53,498
"No, no, use your words, buddy,
use your words.

244
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:55,498
Talk to me. Talk to me.
What do you need?"

245
00:08:55,499 --> 00:08:57,498
"Pull over, pull over."
I'd be like,

246
00:08:57,499 --> 00:08:59,498
"Okay, I will be pulling over
right now. Thank you very much."

247
00:08:59,499 --> 00:09:01,498
Like, it would be more
effective, but I didn't know.

248
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,899
So I'm--and he's like,
"Pull over [mumbles]."

249
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,498
I'm like, "I don't know what
the hell you want."

250
00:09:04,499 --> 00:09:05,498
"Pull over to the side
of the road [mumbles]."

251
00:09:05,499 --> 00:09:07,498
I'm like,
"What are you talking about?"

252
00:09:07,499 --> 00:09:08,498
He's like,
"Pull over! Pull over!"

253
00:09:08,499 --> 00:09:10,498
And I panicked,
and so I stopped. I pulled over.

254
00:09:10,499 --> 00:09:12,498
Right there where I was
on the freeway, which apparently

255
00:09:12,499 --> 00:09:14,498
you're not supposed to do.
I didn't know this,

256
00:09:14,499 --> 00:09:16,498
'cause I just know that police
tell me to do something,

257
00:09:16,499 --> 00:09:17,498
I do it. So he said,
"Pull over," and then I stopped.

258
00:09:17,499 --> 00:09:19,498
and then he was like,
"Don't pull over there."

259
00:09:19,499 --> 00:09:21,498
Then I was like, "Well, you
should have been more specific.

260
00:09:21,499 --> 00:09:23,498
You can't tell me to pull over
and then tell me not pull over.

261
00:09:23,499 --> 00:09:24,498
You should've said pull over at
a time that is more appropriate.

262
00:09:24,499 --> 00:09:26,498
You can't just tell--
Now I'm panicking.

263
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:28,498
He's like,
"Get back onto the road."

264
00:09:28,499 --> 00:09:29,498
I'm like, "This guy does not
know what he wants. I'm--"

265
00:09:29,499 --> 00:09:30,498
Now, I'm back on the road.

266
00:09:30,499 --> 00:09:32,498
He's like,
"Take the next exit."

267
00:09:32,499 --> 00:09:33,498
And now, we're driving
and now he's guiding me along.

268
00:09:33,499 --> 00:09:35,498
It's like I had
a really angry GPS.

269
00:09:35,499 --> 00:09:37,498
It was the weirdest thing ever.

270
00:09:37,499 --> 00:09:39,498
And, so he's driving me like,
Make a right at the light.

271
00:09:39,499 --> 00:09:40,498
Make a right."

272
00:09:40,499 --> 00:09:41,498
It's like I chose angry cop
on my Waze.

273
00:09:41,499 --> 00:09:43,498
That's what it felt like.

274
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,219
He was like, "Turn left.
No, I said left. Turn left."

275
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,498
No, recalculating.
When it is safe, Mickey."

276
00:09:47,499 --> 00:09:50,498
[laughter]

277
00:09:50,499 --> 00:09:52,498
And so finally--
finally we stopped.

278
00:09:52,499 --> 00:09:56,498
We stop, I pull over
on the side of the road.

279
00:09:56,499 --> 00:09:59,498
He pulls over behind me
and he gets out of the car,

280
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:02,498
and I'm shitting myself.

281
00:10:02,499 --> 00:10:04,498
As he gets out, he goes,

282
00:10:04,499 --> 00:10:06,498
"Keep your hands
where I can see them!"

283
00:10:06,499 --> 00:10:08,498
I'm like, "I don't know
what you can see or not see.

284
00:10:08,499 --> 00:10:09,498
"I don't know.

285
00:10:09,499 --> 00:10:11,498
"These are very
vague instructions.

286
00:10:11,499 --> 00:10:14,498
I don't know what you can't"--
So now, I'm doing this.

287
00:10:14,499 --> 00:10:17,179
'Cause I don't know
what you can see or not.

288
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,498
I was--
Like, don't get me wrong.

289
00:10:18,499 --> 00:10:20,498
I just--
You know what the thing is.

290
00:10:20,499 --> 00:10:22,498
I just don't want to die.
That's all, I don't--

291
00:10:22,499 --> 00:10:25,498
I just don't want to die.
And I know I don't look like--

292
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,498
but I'm not the dying type.
I really--I'm not.

293
00:10:27,499 --> 00:10:29,498
Like, I'm a chill-out guy
who likes living.

294
00:10:29,499 --> 00:10:31,498
I don't want to die,
and the worst thing is

295
00:10:31,499 --> 00:10:33,498
I don't know how not to die.

296
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:35,498
That's the thing.
I don't know how not to die.

297
00:10:35,499 --> 00:10:37,498
'Cause every day,
I turn on the TV it seems like

298
00:10:37,499 --> 00:10:39,498
another black person
is being shot.

299
00:10:39,499 --> 00:10:42,498
So I just want to know
how not to get shot, you know?

300
00:10:42,499 --> 00:10:46,498
I try and learn, I really do.
I try and learn, you know?

301
00:10:46,499 --> 00:10:50,498
It all started in the lower--
in the lower echelons

302
00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:52,498
of enforcement, community watch,

303
00:10:52,499 --> 00:10:55,498
George Zimmerman, shot Trayvon,
the young boy.

304
00:10:55,499 --> 00:10:58,498
And the story started off
with "Man shoots boy."

305
00:10:58,499 --> 00:10:59,498
Everyone was like,
"Yeah, this is horrible.

306
00:10:59,499 --> 00:11:01,498
This is disgusting."

307
00:11:01,499 --> 00:11:02,498
But then the news, for some
strange reason, the next day

308
00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:04,498
they just forget and then they
start asking other questions.

309
00:11:04,499 --> 00:11:05,498
"Well, why was he wearing
a hoodie?

310
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:07,498
What was he doing, and why
was he wearing a hoodie?"

311
00:11:07,499 --> 00:11:09,498
I was like, "Oh, is that--so
that's--so don't wear a hoodie."

312
00:11:09,499 --> 00:11:13,498
That's what it is, the hoodie.
It's very frightening.

313
00:11:13,499 --> 00:11:15,498
You don't know
what's going on under there.

314
00:11:15,499 --> 00:11:17,498
Yeah, we've all seen
"Star Wars."

315
00:11:17,499 --> 00:11:19,498
It's the creepiest thing ever.
Yeah, yeah.

316
00:11:19,499 --> 00:11:22,498
It's the dark side.
And so I was like,

317
00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:24,498
oh, if I don't wear a hoodie
then I'm safe.

318
00:11:24,499 --> 00:11:25,498
No one's gonna shoot me
if I don't wear a hoodie.

319
00:11:25,499 --> 00:11:28,498
you cut forward,
and then the next thing you know

320
00:11:28,499 --> 00:11:31,498
it's Mike Brown in Ferguson,
and he gets shot by the police.

321
00:11:31,499 --> 00:11:32,498
Unarmed, gets shot.

322
00:11:32,499 --> 00:11:34,498
You know, like a man was unarmed
and he got shot,

323
00:11:34,499 --> 00:11:36,498
and I was like,
"Oh, this is disgusting."

324
00:11:36,499 --> 00:11:38,498
And they said, "But also,
he approached the police officer

325
00:11:38,499 --> 00:11:40,498
"apparently, and he may or may
not have scuffled with him.

326
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:42,498
We don't know,
but he approached him."

327
00:11:42,499 --> 00:11:44,498
And I was like, okay, okay,
don't wear a hoodie

328
00:11:44,499 --> 00:11:47,498
and don't approach the police.
Don't go towards the police.

329
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:48,498
You see police,
you go the other way.

330
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:51,498
You got the other way from--
Okay, cool. I got it.

331
00:11:51,499 --> 00:11:52,498
So no hoodies,
no approaching the police.

332
00:11:52,499 --> 00:11:54,498
This is it, I'm learning.
I'm learning. This is--

333
00:11:54,499 --> 00:11:56,498
But then--but then the next guy
comes on the news,

334
00:11:56,499 --> 00:11:58,498
Eric Garner
in New York City.

335
00:11:58,499 --> 00:12:00,498
And there he is,
he's standing and the police,

336
00:12:00,499 --> 00:12:01,498
they apprehend him
and they start choking him.

337
00:12:01,499 --> 00:12:03,498
He doesn't go towards them.
He doesn't--

338
00:12:03,499 --> 00:12:04,498
He's standing there
with his arms up,

339
00:12:04,499 --> 00:12:06,498
and he gets choked to death
by six policemen.

340
00:12:06,499 --> 00:12:08,498
And then they come on the news
and they say--and they go,

341
00:12:08,499 --> 00:12:09,498
"Well, you gotta understand,
for these police, I mean,

342
00:12:09,499 --> 00:12:11,498
"this was a--
this was a pretty big guy.

343
00:12:11,499 --> 00:12:14,498
"He was a pretty big guy.
He was scary.

344
00:12:14,499 --> 00:12:16,498
He was a really scary,
big black guy."

345
00:12:16,499 --> 00:12:19,498
And I'm like, "Okay, cool.
So don't be a big black guy

346
00:12:19,499 --> 00:12:20,498
"and then you should be fine.

347
00:12:20,499 --> 00:12:22,498
Don't be a big black guy
and then I should"--

348
00:12:22,499 --> 00:12:25,498
And every day I look in the
mirror and I'm like, "Good job."

349
00:12:25,499 --> 00:12:26,498
And I'm like,
"Okay, fine, fine."

350
00:12:26,499 --> 00:12:29,498
Okay, so don't wear a hoodie.
Don't wear your hoodie

351
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:32,498
and don't approach the policemen
and don't be a big black man.

352
00:12:32,499 --> 00:12:34,498
I think--I think
I've got it all down. I think--

353
00:12:34,499 --> 00:12:36,498
And then I turn on the TV
and then I see Walter Scott.

354
00:12:36,499 --> 00:12:38,498
A 50-something-year-old man

355
00:12:38,499 --> 00:12:40,498
running away from a policeman

356
00:12:40,499 --> 00:12:44,498
getting shot in the back.
Running away from the policeman.

357
00:12:44,499 --> 00:12:47,498
And again, the media,
for some strange reason,

358
00:12:47,499 --> 00:12:48,498
just seems to forget
what the main purpose

359
00:12:48,499 --> 00:12:50,498
of--of the discussion is.
'Cause on day one they go,

360
00:12:50,499 --> 00:12:52,498
"Unarmed man shot in the back."

361
00:12:52,499 --> 00:12:55,498
Day two they're like,
"Who was Walter Scott?

362
00:12:55,499 --> 00:12:57,498
"Let's find out about it.

363
00:12:57,499 --> 00:13:01,498
Apparently he had a charge
of assault against him in 1987."

364
00:13:01,499 --> 00:13:04,498
So he gets shot for it?

365
00:13:04,499 --> 00:13:05,498
How hard did he punch the guy

366
00:13:05,499 --> 00:13:07,498
that he gets shot for it
in 2015?

367
00:13:07,499 --> 00:13:09,498
What, did he punch the guy
into the future

368
00:13:09,499 --> 00:13:11,498
and then he came back to get
him? Is that what happened?

369
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,498
I mean, it was the '80s.

370
00:13:13,499 --> 00:13:14,498
Everyone punched somebody
in the '80s.

371
00:13:14,499 --> 00:13:16,498
I don't understand why
this is a big deal.

372
00:13:16,499 --> 00:13:17,498
They were saying
the craziest things.

373
00:13:17,499 --> 00:13:19,498
They were like, "Walter Scott,
I mean, this is--

374
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:20,498
"Everybody's talking about
the police officer.

375
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:22,619
Let's talk about him.
Why did he run? Why did he run?"

376
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:26,498
'Cause he didn't want
to go to jail.

377
00:13:26,499 --> 00:13:28,498
Are we really
gonna live in a world

378
00:13:28,499 --> 00:13:29,498
where police no longer
want to chase criminals?

379
00:13:29,499 --> 00:13:31,498
Is that what we're saying?
Is that what we're saying?

380
00:13:31,499 --> 00:13:33,498
Police no longer want
to chase criminals.

381
00:13:33,499 --> 00:13:34,498
That's the whole point
of the game, isn't it?

382
00:13:34,499 --> 00:13:36,498
We played it as kids,
cops and robbers, yeah?

383
00:13:36,499 --> 00:13:38,498
You've seen the movies.
That's what makes it fun.

384
00:13:38,499 --> 00:13:40,498
"Freeze!"
"You can't catch me, copper."

385
00:13:40,499 --> 00:13:41,498
And then you run.

386
00:13:41,499 --> 00:13:45,498
That's what makes it fun.

387
00:13:45,499 --> 00:13:46,498
Now, police no longer want
to chase criminals.

388
00:13:46,499 --> 00:13:48,498
We're gonna live in a world
where police--

389
00:13:48,499 --> 00:13:50,498
Can you imagine what that's
gonna do to the movie industry?

390
00:13:50,499 --> 00:13:51,498
It's gonna be horrible.

391
00:13:51,499 --> 00:13:53,498
We're gonna be watching
"Bad Boys Five,"

392
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,498
Martin Lawrence and Will Smith,
"Freeze!"

393
00:13:55,499 --> 00:13:57,498
"Okay."
End of movie. Done.

394
00:13:57,499 --> 00:14:00,498
It would be
the worst movie ever.

395
00:14:00,499 --> 00:14:01,498
This is the strangest thing.

396
00:14:01,499 --> 00:14:03,498
They ask all the weird
questions,

397
00:14:03,499 --> 00:14:05,498
questions that have nothing to
do with a man being shot

398
00:14:05,499 --> 00:14:07,498
who is unarmed.

399
00:14:07,499 --> 00:14:09,498
They come on and they go,
"Also--also noted

400
00:14:09,499 --> 00:14:13,499
is that Walter Scott owed
$16,000 in child support."

401
00:14:15,499 --> 00:14:17,498
To the cop?

402
00:14:17,499 --> 00:14:20,498
[laughter]

403
00:14:20,499 --> 00:14:21,498
No, no, I mean, like--

404
00:14:21,499 --> 00:14:24,498
[cheers and applause]

405
00:14:24,499 --> 00:14:27,499
To the--

406
00:14:29,499 --> 00:14:30,498
'Cause--'cause that would be
a different story.

407
00:14:30,499 --> 00:14:33,498
That would be like if that was
the mother of his children

408
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:35,498
that shot him,
then you know what?

409
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,498
I may--I may actually
be on her side.

410
00:14:37,499 --> 00:14:39,498
You never know, yeah.

411
00:14:39,499 --> 00:14:40,498
I might have been there like,
"You know what, sister,

412
00:14:40,499 --> 00:14:42,498
"you shoot him in the back,
girl.

413
00:14:42,499 --> 00:14:43,498
"That's right, you shoot him

414
00:14:43,499 --> 00:14:46,498
"thinking he ain't gonna pay
after he play.

415
00:14:46,499 --> 00:14:49,498
"You shoot him in the back
thinking he gonna run away

416
00:14:49,499 --> 00:14:52,498
"from his responsibilities.

417
00:14:52,499 --> 00:14:56,498
Shoot him dead."

418
00:14:56,499 --> 00:14:57,498
But this has nothing
to do with it.

419
00:14:57,499 --> 00:14:59,498
A policeman shoots
an unarmed man.

420
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:02,498
He's running away,
and they have the nerve--

421
00:15:02,499 --> 00:15:04,498
They have the nerve,
the crazy nerve to say,

422
00:15:04,499 --> 00:15:06,498
"This officer feared
for his life. He was afraid."

423
00:15:06,499 --> 00:15:09,498
Afraid of what?
The man's running away.

424
00:15:09,499 --> 00:15:12,498
There's nothing less frightening

425
00:15:12,499 --> 00:15:14,498
than somebody
running away from you.

426
00:15:14,499 --> 00:15:16,498
That is the definition of fear.
He's running away.

427
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,498
The only thing he could have
done to be less threatening

428
00:15:18,499 --> 00:15:20,498
is to cluck like a chicken
as he--[clucking].

429
00:15:20,499 --> 00:15:22,498
There's nothing less frightening
than a man

430
00:15:22,499 --> 00:15:24,498
running away from you.
Like, what are you afraid of?

431
00:15:24,499 --> 00:15:26,498
You can't say he was running--
"I was afraid."

432
00:15:26,499 --> 00:15:29,498
Afraid of what?
He's running away from you.

433
00:15:29,499 --> 00:15:31,498
That makes no sense.
You're seeing him from behind.

434
00:15:31,499 --> 00:15:33,498
No one's threatening
from behind.

435
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:34,498
They're running away.
There's no one who's--

436
00:15:34,499 --> 00:15:38,498
Like, maybe Kim Kardashian,
but nobody else is--

437
00:15:38,499 --> 00:15:40,498
He's running away from you.

438
00:15:40,499 --> 00:15:42,498
You shoot him in the back.

439
00:15:42,499 --> 00:15:44,498
Like, yeah, "I was afraid."
Afraid of what?

440
00:15:44,499 --> 00:15:45,498
What, do you have
abandonment issues?

441
00:15:45,499 --> 00:15:49,498
Why would you shoot a man--

442
00:15:49,499 --> 00:15:52,498
"My dad left when I was five."

443
00:15:52,499 --> 00:15:54,498
Makes no sense.

444
00:15:54,499 --> 00:15:58,498
So I don't know how not to die.

445
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,498
And here I am in my car
on the side of the road

446
00:16:01,499 --> 00:16:03,498
in a random street
in Los Angeles,

447
00:16:03,499 --> 00:16:06,498
and the whole time it was like,
"I don't want to die.

448
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:08,498
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die."

449
00:16:08,499 --> 00:16:10,498
And the policeman
gets out of his car

450
00:16:10,499 --> 00:16:14,498
and he starts walking
towards me

451
00:16:14,499 --> 00:16:17,498
and his hand is by his side.

452
00:16:17,499 --> 00:16:21,498
And it's doing this.

453
00:16:21,499 --> 00:16:23,498
And I've watched westerns.

454
00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:25,498
[laughter]

455
00:16:25,499 --> 00:16:27,498
I know what this means.

456
00:16:27,499 --> 00:16:29,498
This is never good.

457
00:16:29,499 --> 00:16:32,498
This never turns into
friendship.

458
00:16:32,499 --> 00:16:35,499
[laughter]

459
00:16:37,499 --> 00:16:39,498
So now, I'm starting to stress
and I'm looking at him

460
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,498
in the side mirror of my car
and I'm panicking,

461
00:16:41,499 --> 00:16:44,498
because objects in the mirror
are closer than they appear.

462
00:16:44,499 --> 00:16:46,498
So he's gonna get there
at any moment.

463
00:16:46,499 --> 00:16:47,498
And I don't know why,
I don't know why I did this.

464
00:16:47,499 --> 00:16:49,498
Like as soon as he--I panicked.
I completely panicked,

465
00:16:49,499 --> 00:16:50,498
and I launched myself
out the window.

466
00:16:50,499 --> 00:16:52,498
I took my body
and I threw it out the window,

467
00:16:52,499 --> 00:16:54,498
and I fell under the side
of the car just like...

468
00:16:54,499 --> 00:16:56,498
[imitated explosion]
and onto the side of the car.

469
00:16:56,499 --> 00:16:58,498
I basically went back to nature.
I thought of a predator.

470
00:16:58,499 --> 00:17:00,498
You don't make eye contact
and you play dead.

471
00:17:00,499 --> 00:17:03,498
That's all I did, I just played
dead on the side of the car.

472
00:17:03,499 --> 00:17:05,498
Which freaked him out.
He was completely--

473
00:17:05,499 --> 00:17:08,498
He was just like, "What?
Hey, hey! Hey, what's going on?"

474
00:17:08,499 --> 00:17:10,498
I said, "I'm sorry, officer.
I'm sorry."

475
00:17:10,499 --> 00:17:12,498
He's like, "Sir,
what are you sorry for?"

476
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:14,498
I said, "Whatever it is that's
gonna make you shoot me,

477
00:17:14,499 --> 00:17:16,659
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, officer."

478
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,498
He said, "Sir, get back in
the car. Get back in the car."

479
00:17:18,499 --> 00:17:21,498
I said, "No! I don't wanna die.

480
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,498
"Please, I'm not falling
for that trick.

481
00:17:23,499 --> 00:17:25,498
Please, officer, I'm sorry."

482
00:17:25,499 --> 00:17:26,498
He's like, "Sir, I'm not--
I'm not gonna kill you.

483
00:17:26,499 --> 00:17:28,498
Just get back in the car."
And I mean,

484
00:17:28,499 --> 00:17:30,498
this guy was just as freaked out
as I was. I'm not gonna lie.

485
00:17:30,499 --> 00:17:32,498
'Cause I mean, when I put myself
in his shoes, what does he do?

486
00:17:32,499 --> 00:17:33,498
Imagine that, you're standing on
the side of the road,

487
00:17:33,499 --> 00:17:35,498
a guy jumps out of his own car.
What doe he--

488
00:17:35,499 --> 00:17:37,498
He can't even call for backup.
What does he say?

489
00:17:37,499 --> 00:17:39,498
"10-4, I need backup."
"What do you need?"

490
00:17:39,499 --> 00:17:41,498
"I got a black guy,
killed himself?"

491
00:17:41,499 --> 00:17:44,498
"10-4, you gotta make something
up better than that.

492
00:17:44,499 --> 00:17:45,498
We'll back you up, don't worry."

493
00:17:45,499 --> 00:17:47,498
Like, you can't--
Like, what do you say?

494
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:49,498
It's just like a weird--
The guy's freaking out.

495
00:17:49,499 --> 00:17:52,498
I'm freaking out,
and I'm lying there.

496
00:17:52,499 --> 00:17:54,498
And this guy,
he--he approaches slowly.

497
00:17:54,499 --> 00:17:56,498
He approaches, he finally gets
to me and lifts my arms,

498
00:17:56,499 --> 00:17:58,498
and he's like, "Get back
in the car, sir, get back.

499
00:17:58,499 --> 00:18:00,498
Get back in." And he stuffs--he
stuffs me back into my window.

500
00:18:00,499 --> 00:18:02,498
"Get back there." I'm like,
"No, no, I'm not--

501
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:05,498
Please, I don't want to die."

502
00:18:05,499 --> 00:18:07,498
He's like, "Sir, sir, calm down.
Calm down."

503
00:18:07,499 --> 00:18:11,498
I go, "Okay. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry."

504
00:18:11,499 --> 00:18:13,498
He's like,
"Sir, have you been drinking?"

505
00:18:13,499 --> 00:18:16,498
I said, "No, sir,
I haven't been drinking."

506
00:18:16,499 --> 00:18:17,498
He said, "Okay, calm down.

507
00:18:17,499 --> 00:18:19,498
Do you know why
I pulled you over, sir?"

508
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:23,498
I said, "Is it because
I'm black?"

509
00:18:23,499 --> 00:18:26,498
And now, I wasn't being an ass,
nor was I joking.

510
00:18:26,499 --> 00:18:29,498
I'd just been informed that
as a black person in America,

511
00:18:29,499 --> 00:18:32,498
if you drive a really nice car,
there's a good chance

512
00:18:32,499 --> 00:18:34,498
you're gonna get pulled over
by the police.

513
00:18:34,499 --> 00:18:35,498
Yeah, so in my world,

514
00:18:35,499 --> 00:18:38,498
he was doing his job
as I had been told.

515
00:18:38,499 --> 00:18:40,498
Yeah, I wasn't judging him.

516
00:18:40,499 --> 00:18:41,498
In fact, I was--
I was a little flattered.

517
00:18:41,499 --> 00:18:44,498
I was like, "Well, thank you
very much, Mr. Officer,

518
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:47,498
"for noticing this bad boy
right here.

519
00:18:47,499 --> 00:18:49,498
That's right, 2015, baby."

520
00:18:49,499 --> 00:18:50,498
I was really excited.

521
00:18:50,499 --> 00:18:53,498
He was more freaked out, though,
'cause I--'cause I said to him,

522
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:54,498
I said, "Is it because
I'm black?"

523
00:18:54,499 --> 00:18:58,498
And then he did this thing
that I've come to learn

524
00:18:58,499 --> 00:19:00,498
is the reaction of white people
in America

525
00:19:00,499 --> 00:19:05,498
who, when they hear information
they can't process fast enough,

526
00:19:05,499 --> 00:19:07,498
have this--this thing
where they smile on the outside,

527
00:19:07,499 --> 00:19:12,259
but on the inside, it's almost
as if they're short-circuiting.

528
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,498
[laughter]

529
00:19:13,499 --> 00:19:16,498
Like, he looks at me and he
goes, "I'm--I'm sorry, what?"

530
00:19:16,499 --> 00:19:17,498
I said, "Because I'm black,
that's why you pulled me over."

531
00:19:17,499 --> 00:19:19,498
And he goes, "Uh, no.
Hey, no, no. Hey, we--

532
00:19:19,499 --> 00:19:23,498
"No, that--that is not--that--
No. No. Hey, um, who--

533
00:19:23,499 --> 00:19:26,498
I don't--I don't--No.
No, that is not why--"

534
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,499
[stutters]

535
00:19:32,499 --> 00:19:35,498
[imitates explosion]

536
00:19:35,499 --> 00:19:37,498
I felt so bad for him.

537
00:19:37,499 --> 00:19:39,498
Yeah, I think we both
learned a lot that day.

538
00:19:39,499 --> 00:19:43,498
The two of us grew
from that experience.

539
00:19:43,499 --> 00:19:44,498
Yeah.

540
00:19:44,499 --> 00:19:47,299
I was speeding,
that's why he pulled me over.

541
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,498
[laughter]

542
00:19:48,499 --> 00:19:50,498
Yeah.

543
00:19:50,499 --> 00:19:53,498
But he let me go.

544
00:19:53,499 --> 00:19:55,498
Fear.

545
00:19:55,499 --> 00:19:57,498
I'm having a great time,
I really am.

546
00:19:57,499 --> 00:20:00,498
I'm not getting speeding fines,
enjoying my time out here.

547
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,498
Some of you may or may not know,
I got a job.

548
00:20:02,499 --> 00:20:04,498
This is fantastic for me.

549
00:20:04,499 --> 00:20:05,498
[cheers and applause]

550
00:20:05,499 --> 00:20:07,498
Thank you very much.

551
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:10,498
Thank you.
Thank you very much, yeah.

552
00:20:10,499 --> 00:20:13,499
[cheers and applause]

553
00:20:14,499 --> 00:20:16,498
That's--and that's--

554
00:20:16,499 --> 00:20:18,219
That's how my grandmother
put it, funny enough.

555
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,299
I phoned my grandmother to tell
her that I'd be working

556
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,498
on "The Daily Show,"
and she was really excited.

557
00:20:22,499 --> 00:20:25,498
She was like, "Whoo, Trevor!

558
00:20:25,499 --> 00:20:29,498
"I'm so happy for you!

559
00:20:29,499 --> 00:20:33,498
Well done. You got a job."

560
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:36,498
I said, "No, no, Granny,
I already had a job."

561
00:20:36,499 --> 00:20:38,498
And she's like, "No, you didn't.

562
00:20:38,499 --> 00:20:41,498
Did you have an office?"
I said, "No."

563
00:20:41,499 --> 00:20:44,498
She's like,
"Then it wasn't a job."

564
00:20:44,499 --> 00:20:45,498
That's all she cares about.

565
00:20:45,499 --> 00:20:47,498
My mom was a bit better.

566
00:20:47,499 --> 00:20:49,498
I called her to tell her
the news,

567
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:50,498
and to give you a bit
of a backstory,

568
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,498
I've got two younger brothers.

569
00:20:52,499 --> 00:20:54,498
Right, so one brother
is nine years younger than me,

570
00:20:54,499 --> 00:20:58,498
and then the youngest is
20 years younger than me, right.

571
00:20:58,499 --> 00:21:02,498
And so the youngest just became

572
00:21:02,499 --> 00:21:05,498
one of the student council
members in his school, right.

573
00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:06,498
So he got onto
the student council.

574
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:08,498
So I phoned my mom
to tell her my good news.

575
00:21:08,499 --> 00:21:10,498
I'm on the phone with her
and I'm like, "Oh, Mom,

576
00:21:10,499 --> 00:21:12,498
I don't know if you heard, I'm
gonna be on 'The Daily Show.'"

577
00:21:12,499 --> 00:21:13,498
And she's like, "Oh, my baby,
I'm so excited.

578
00:21:13,499 --> 00:21:15,498
"Oh, praise Jesus,
this is wonderful.

579
00:21:15,499 --> 00:21:16,899
"Well done, baby.
I'm so happy for you.

580
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,498
And did you hear what happened
to your brother?"

581
00:21:19,499 --> 00:21:20,498
I'm like, "No, what happened?"

582
00:21:20,499 --> 00:21:22,498
"Oh, he's on the student council
at his school.

583
00:21:22,499 --> 00:21:23,498
"Oh, I'm so excited.

584
00:21:23,499 --> 00:21:26,498
"Both my boys are doing
big things in the world.

585
00:21:26,499 --> 00:21:29,379
I'm so happy. Oh!"

586
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,498
[cheers and applause]

587
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:36,498
And I was like, "Yeah, some
things are bigger than others."

588
00:21:36,499 --> 00:21:37,498
[laughter]

589
00:21:37,499 --> 00:21:39,498
She's like,
"No, it's all the same."

590
00:21:39,499 --> 00:21:42,498
I was like, "You say that,
but I mean, you know.

591
00:21:42,499 --> 00:21:44,699
Come on, you know."
[laughs]

592
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,498
She's like, "Okay, fine, fine.
You were never student council.

593
00:21:48,499 --> 00:21:52,498
So let's cheer for him."
I'm like, "What?"

594
00:21:52,499 --> 00:21:55,498
It was a wonderful experience.

595
00:21:55,499 --> 00:21:57,498
Changed my life completely.

596
00:21:57,499 --> 00:22:01,498
Come into the U.S., feel like
people are smiling at me more.

597
00:22:01,499 --> 00:22:04,498
Might just be my imagination.

598
00:22:04,499 --> 00:22:07,498
'Cause I noticed at the airports
when I've been flying in,

599
00:22:07,499 --> 00:22:10,498
probably a combination
of--of my job

600
00:22:10,499 --> 00:22:12,499
and the fact that
the Ebola crisis is now past.

601
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,498
That was probably the worst--
the worst time ever

602
00:22:15,499 --> 00:22:19,498
is flying into America
as an African

603
00:22:19,499 --> 00:22:22,498
during the Ebola crisis.

604
00:22:22,499 --> 00:22:24,498
It was the craziest thing
I've ever seen in an airport.

605
00:22:24,499 --> 00:22:27,498
You'd walk in,
there'd be tension.

606
00:22:27,499 --> 00:22:30,498
They'd usher everybody
into a special quarantine area.

607
00:22:30,499 --> 00:22:33,498
Ask you questions, questions
that they don't normally ask.

608
00:22:33,499 --> 00:22:34,498
The number one question they
always asked was,

609
00:22:34,499 --> 00:22:36,498
"Sir, have you been in contact
with Ebola?"

610
00:22:36,499 --> 00:22:39,498
They'd always ask, "Sir, have
you been in contact with Ebola?"

611
00:22:39,499 --> 00:22:42,498
I love--I love the sincerity
of the question.

612
00:22:42,499 --> 00:22:46,498
Like there was a chance
my answer could be, "Yes.

613
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:49,498
And next stop, Disney World."

614
00:22:49,499 --> 00:22:51,498
[laughter]

615
00:22:51,499 --> 00:22:53,498
[laughs]

616
00:22:53,499 --> 00:22:55,498
Like, what kind of person
do you think I am

617
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:56,498
that I'd still be embarking
on a journey

618
00:22:56,499 --> 00:22:57,498
having knowingly been in contact

619
00:22:57,499 --> 00:22:59,498
with the most deadly disease
on the planet?

620
00:22:59,499 --> 00:23:01,498
Like, who do you think I am that
I'd be there like,

621
00:23:01,499 --> 00:23:02,498
"[coughs]

622
00:23:02,499 --> 00:23:04,498
"I don't care!

623
00:23:04,499 --> 00:23:07,498
"Booking.com has
a zero refund policy.

624
00:23:07,499 --> 00:23:09,498
"I'm going to Disney World
even if it kills me,

625
00:23:09,499 --> 00:23:11,498
"Mickey Mouse,
and everybody else.

626
00:23:11,499 --> 00:23:14,498
I'm going!"

627
00:23:14,499 --> 00:23:16,498
"Have you been in contact
with Ebola?"

628
00:23:16,499 --> 00:23:18,498
And they always say that

629
00:23:18,499 --> 00:23:19,498
like Ebola was like
a distant relative.

630
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:21,498
I love the phrasing. "Have you
been in contact with Ebola?"

631
00:23:21,499 --> 00:23:24,498
"Yeah, I spoke to him last week.
He's doing well, eh.

632
00:23:24,499 --> 00:23:27,498
Thank you very much for asking."

633
00:23:27,499 --> 00:23:29,498
Ebola made flying a nightmare.

634
00:23:29,499 --> 00:23:31,498
One of the worst flights,
I was coming from

635
00:23:31,499 --> 00:23:33,498
Johannesburg, South Africa,
going to San Francisco.

636
00:23:33,499 --> 00:23:35,498
Flew and then because
the distance of the flight,

637
00:23:35,499 --> 00:23:37,498
you have to stop over
in Washington,

638
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,498
and they change over
your flight,

639
00:23:39,499 --> 00:23:40,498
so you go on to another plane,
and then that plane

640
00:23:40,499 --> 00:23:42,498
takes you to San Francisco.

641
00:23:42,499 --> 00:23:44,498
And when we were
changing planes,

642
00:23:44,499 --> 00:23:45,498
when we were switching over,

643
00:23:45,499 --> 00:23:47,498
the air hostess
on the second plane

644
00:23:47,499 --> 00:23:51,498
tells the passengers that
Africans are coming on board.

645
00:23:51,499 --> 00:23:53,498
Right, and so because of this,

646
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:56,498
they're gonna be spraying the
cabin with a light pesticide.

647
00:23:56,499 --> 00:23:57,699
Right. No, I understand.

648
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,498
Like, when people are afraid,
they do stupid things.

649
00:23:59,499 --> 00:24:01,498
I get it.

650
00:24:01,499 --> 00:24:03,498
But what I didn't understand was

651
00:24:03,499 --> 00:24:07,498
why she told them this
as we were boarding the plane.

652
00:24:07,499 --> 00:24:09,498
[laughter]

653
00:24:09,499 --> 00:24:13,498
Have the decency
to speak behind our backs.

654
00:24:13,499 --> 00:24:16,498
'Cause we're walking
onto the aircraft

655
00:24:16,499 --> 00:24:18,498
and she takes
her little microphone,

656
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:20,498
she goes, "Ladies and gentlemen,

657
00:24:20,499 --> 00:24:22,498
"please note we have
some passengers joining us

658
00:24:22,499 --> 00:24:24,498
"from the South African flight.
They're coming from Africa.

659
00:24:24,499 --> 00:24:26,498
"If everybody could please
stay in their seats

660
00:24:26,499 --> 00:24:27,498
"as these passengers
find their place.

661
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:30,498
"We're gonna be spraying the
cabin with a light pesticide

662
00:24:30,499 --> 00:24:32,498
"due to the Ebola crisis.

663
00:24:32,499 --> 00:24:34,819
"And feel free to cover your
nose, eyes, ears, and mouth.

664
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,498
"The pesticide shouldn't be
harmful, but it may be.

665
00:24:37,499 --> 00:24:39,498
"So if everybody would
just cover up, and we'll be

666
00:24:39,499 --> 00:24:41,498
"coming down shortly
as everybody takes their place.

667
00:24:41,499 --> 00:24:43,498
Thank you very much."

668
00:24:43,499 --> 00:24:44,498
She says this
as we board the plane.

669
00:24:44,499 --> 00:24:46,498
This is our introduction,
"Ebola crisis."

670
00:24:46,499 --> 00:24:49,498
And we're there like,
"Hello, hello, hello, hello.

671
00:24:49,499 --> 00:24:51,498
Hello, hello, hi."

672
00:24:51,499 --> 00:24:53,498
Do you know how hard it is
to find a seat in a plane

673
00:24:53,499 --> 00:24:54,498
with people that think
you're bringing them death?

674
00:24:54,499 --> 00:24:56,498
Do you know how hard it--

675
00:24:56,499 --> 00:24:58,498
Like, you're sitting there
and everyone, you go--

676
00:24:58,499 --> 00:25:00,498
It almost felt like that scene
from "Forrest Gump."

677
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:01,498
Like, as I'm walking
down the plane,

678
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:03,498
people were like, "Mnh-mnh.

679
00:25:03,499 --> 00:25:06,498
You can't sit here, no space."

680
00:25:06,499 --> 00:25:09,498
You're just walking down trying
to find your Jenny.

681
00:25:09,499 --> 00:25:12,498
[laughter]

682
00:25:12,499 --> 00:25:14,498
Finally, everyone's seated.

683
00:25:14,499 --> 00:25:16,498
We take off,

684
00:25:16,499 --> 00:25:18,498
plane heads out
to San Francisco.

685
00:25:18,499 --> 00:25:22,498
And it was by far
the most tense flight

686
00:25:22,499 --> 00:25:26,498
I have ever been on.

687
00:25:26,499 --> 00:25:28,498
I coughed once.

688
00:25:28,499 --> 00:25:31,498
[laughter]

689
00:25:31,499 --> 00:25:34,498
The plane shook.

690
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:36,498
It wasn't even a bad cough.

691
00:25:36,499 --> 00:25:37,498
It was just like
a little tickle.

692
00:25:37,499 --> 00:25:38,739
I was just like,
[coughs]

693
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:41,498
The guy opposite me was like,
"Ebola!

694
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:42,498
Ebola!"

695
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:45,498
I was like, "Yo, dude,
calm down, man.

696
00:25:45,499 --> 00:25:48,498
"Calm down. It's just AIDS.
You're safe, buddy.

697
00:25:48,499 --> 00:25:50,498
"Calm down.

698
00:25:50,499 --> 00:25:53,498
It's okay."

699
00:25:53,499 --> 00:25:56,498
Everyone was so stressed.
The plane was tense.

700
00:25:56,499 --> 00:25:57,498
No one wanted food nor snacks.

701
00:25:57,499 --> 00:25:59,498
We finally land at the airport.

702
00:25:59,499 --> 00:26:01,498
The plane is taxiing
to the gate,

703
00:26:01,499 --> 00:26:02,498
and everyone,
everyone was waiting

704
00:26:02,499 --> 00:26:05,498
for that seat belt sign
to go off. Everyone was just--

705
00:26:05,499 --> 00:26:06,499
Like, it was more than normal,
'cause already--

706
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,498
I never understand why people
are in a hurry on a plane

707
00:26:09,499 --> 00:26:11,498
to get out of their seat, like,
'cause you can't go anywhere.

708
00:26:11,499 --> 00:26:13,498
Whenever a plane lands,
everyone's just in a--

709
00:26:13,499 --> 00:26:15,498
"Come on. Come on. Come on."

710
00:26:15,499 --> 00:26:17,498
You can't go--You're gonna go
there. That's where you--

711
00:26:17,499 --> 00:26:19,498
You literally go there.

712
00:26:19,499 --> 00:26:21,498
"Come on, come on."
Boop!

713
00:26:21,499 --> 00:26:22,498
Yeah.

714
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:25,498
You can't--I don't understand
why people are in a hurry to go.

715
00:26:25,499 --> 00:26:26,498
You know who's even worse?
The people at the window.

716
00:26:26,499 --> 00:26:28,498
You have no right
to be in a hurry.

717
00:26:28,499 --> 00:26:31,498
You're sitting there like,
"Come on, come on.

718
00:26:31,499 --> 00:26:33,498
Come on!"
Boop!

719
00:26:33,499 --> 00:26:36,498
Yeah. Oh, that's good. Yeah.

720
00:26:36,499 --> 00:26:39,498
Yeah, pass me my luggage, pass
it to me now. Right now. Yeah.

721
00:26:39,499 --> 00:26:41,498
I'm glad I didn't sit down
for two more minutes.

722
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:43,498
This is much more comfortable.

723
00:26:43,499 --> 00:26:45,498
Just stay in your seat.
Just wait.

724
00:26:45,499 --> 00:26:48,498
Ebola made it worse,
a hundred times worse, you know,

725
00:26:48,499 --> 00:26:50,498
'cause now everyone wants to
get out of the plane.

726
00:26:50,499 --> 00:26:51,498
Coughing, sneezing,
you can feel the tension.

727
00:26:51,499 --> 00:26:53,498
And as we're about to leave,

728
00:26:53,499 --> 00:26:55,498
the air hostess comes back on
the P.A., and she goes,

729
00:26:55,499 --> 00:26:56,498
"Ladies and gentlemen,
back in your seats, please.

730
00:26:56,499 --> 00:26:58,498
"Everybody back in your seats.
Unfortunately, right now,

731
00:26:58,499 --> 00:27:00,498
"we have a health and safety
official

732
00:27:00,499 --> 00:27:02,498
"that needs to come on board
just to make sure

733
00:27:02,499 --> 00:27:04,498
"that everything is A-OK,
due to Ebola.

734
00:27:04,499 --> 00:27:06,498
"We're just gonna make sure
that everything is fine.

735
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:07,498
"So please stay in your seats,
ladies and gentlemen.

736
00:27:07,499 --> 00:27:09,498
Again, apologies for the delay."

737
00:27:09,499 --> 00:27:12,498
She says this
and then this man comes on,

738
00:27:12,499 --> 00:27:13,539
the health and safety official,
right.

739
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:16,498
And he has with him a list
of all the African passengers

740
00:27:16,499 --> 00:27:18,498
and a thermometer, right,

741
00:27:18,499 --> 00:27:20,498
a digital laser thermometer.

742
00:27:20,499 --> 00:27:22,498
And he comes on
and his job is to scan

743
00:27:22,499 --> 00:27:24,498
all the African passengers
and get their temperature.

744
00:27:24,499 --> 00:27:26,498
And I think the way it works

745
00:27:26,499 --> 00:27:27,498
is, like, if you're very hot,
then you've got Ebola, right.

746
00:27:27,499 --> 00:27:29,498
So he's got the list
and he walks around,

747
00:27:29,499 --> 00:27:31,498
scans the passengers
and gets the thing,

748
00:27:31,499 --> 00:27:33,299
walks down, takes their names
off the list,

749
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,339
gets the temperature,
gets the names,

750
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,498
temperature, names.

751
00:27:36,499 --> 00:27:39,498
Finally gets to where I'm seated
and does the weirdest thing.

752
00:27:39,499 --> 00:27:41,498
He scans the passenger
opposite me,

753
00:27:41,499 --> 00:27:43,498
moves to my aisle,

754
00:27:43,499 --> 00:27:46,498
looks at me, looks at my name,

755
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:48,498
looks back at me.

756
00:27:48,499 --> 00:27:50,498
And then he just shrugs
and walks away.

757
00:27:50,499 --> 00:27:53,498
[laughter]

758
00:27:53,499 --> 00:27:55,498
Nah.

759
00:27:55,499 --> 00:27:58,498
[laughter]

760
00:27:58,499 --> 00:28:02,498
Almost as if
I wasn't African enough.

761
00:28:02,499 --> 00:28:05,498
[laughter]

762
00:28:05,499 --> 00:28:08,499
I've never felt so conflicted
in my life.

763
00:28:10,499 --> 00:28:13,498
You know, because
don't get me wrong, right.

764
00:28:13,499 --> 00:28:16,498
I never want anyone to think
I have Ebola.

765
00:28:16,499 --> 00:28:21,498
[laughter]

766
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:22,619
But I also don't want anyone to
assume

767
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:25,498
that I can't have Ebola.

768
00:28:25,499 --> 00:28:28,498
[laughter]

769
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:30,498
You don't know me.

770
00:28:30,499 --> 00:28:31,498
You don't know
what I'm capable of.

771
00:28:31,499 --> 00:28:34,499
I could have all the Ebola
in the world.

772
00:28:38,381 --> 00:28:39,380
- I'm there
trying to cheer myself up.

773
00:28:39,381 --> 00:28:40,541
Like, "Chin up, Trevor.
You could have Ebola.

774
00:28:40,542 --> 00:28:42,380
"Chin up, kid, come on, come on.

775
00:28:42,381 --> 00:28:44,380
Come on, you could have Ebola."

776
00:28:44,381 --> 00:28:45,380
And he walks to the back
of the plane,

777
00:28:45,381 --> 00:28:49,380
scans the rest of the
passengers, gets to the tail,

778
00:28:49,381 --> 00:28:51,380
and he realizes
he's now missing a name.

779
00:28:51,381 --> 00:28:52,380
So he looks back through
the plane,

780
00:28:52,381 --> 00:28:54,380
can't figure out
what's going on.

781
00:28:54,381 --> 00:28:56,380
I know it's me. I know it's me,
but I'm not gonna help him.

782
00:28:56,381 --> 00:28:59,380
No. He had his chance.

783
00:28:59,381 --> 00:29:01,380
He had a good Ebola man
and he let him go.

784
00:29:01,381 --> 00:29:04,380
And so I watch him panic,
and as he panics,

785
00:29:04,381 --> 00:29:06,380
the air hostess comes back
down the plane.

786
00:29:06,381 --> 00:29:08,380
She goes, "Hey, what's going on?
I need to get the people out."

787
00:29:08,381 --> 00:29:10,380
He goes, "Yeah, I know. I got
a problem with the Ebola list.

788
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:12,380
I can't figure out where the--
where the passenger is."

789
00:29:12,381 --> 00:29:14,380
And she's like, "Yeah,
I gotta get the people out."

790
00:29:14,381 --> 00:29:15,380
He's like, "Look, I know.
This is killing me as well,

791
00:29:15,381 --> 00:29:17,380
but I just gotta figure out."
She's like, "Yeah, yeah,

792
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:18,380
"if I don't get them out,
I'm dead. I'm dead.

793
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:20,380
I gotta get the people going."

794
00:29:20,381 --> 00:29:21,380
He's like, "Yeah, I know.
Just calm down.

795
00:29:21,381 --> 00:29:22,380
Just give me a second,"
and now--

796
00:29:22,381 --> 00:29:24,380
now you can feel the tension
building on the plane.

797
00:29:24,381 --> 00:29:26,380
People start whispering,
there's murmurs going around,

798
00:29:26,381 --> 00:29:28,380
'cause some people are hearing
pieces of the conversations.

799
00:29:28,381 --> 00:29:30,380
Like broken telephone as it goes
down the plane,

800
00:29:30,381 --> 00:29:32,380
all they're hearing is,
"Yeah, yeah, Ebola. Ebola.

801
00:29:32,381 --> 00:29:36,380
Killing the people. Dead, dead,
everybody out of here. Dead."

802
00:29:36,381 --> 00:29:37,380
You can feel the tension.

803
00:29:37,381 --> 00:29:39,380
People start looking
at each other.

804
00:29:39,381 --> 00:29:41,380
The guy opposite me
didn't even hide it.

805
00:29:41,381 --> 00:29:44,380
He was like, "It's you.
It's you! Ebola, it's you!"

806
00:29:44,381 --> 00:29:45,380
I was like, "Dude,
I do not have Ebola.

807
00:29:45,381 --> 00:29:47,380
Stop saying that.
Stop saying that."

808
00:29:47,381 --> 00:29:49,380
He's like, "It's you, damn it.
It's you with your coughing."

809
00:29:49,381 --> 00:29:51,380
I was like, "If you don't
shut up, I'll cough on you.

810
00:29:51,381 --> 00:29:53,380
I'll cough on you now."
He was like, "What?"

811
00:29:53,381 --> 00:29:55,380
I was like, "I'll cough...
[coughs]"

812
00:29:55,381 --> 00:29:56,380
He was like,
"What, I'll kill you."

813
00:29:56,381 --> 00:29:59,380
I was like, "I'll kill you
first. [coughs]"

814
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:01,380
Aah!

815
00:30:01,381 --> 00:30:02,380
Everyone on the plane
starts losing it.

816
00:30:02,381 --> 00:30:05,221
The people are going crazy.
Everyone is stressed.

817
00:30:05,222 --> 00:30:07,380
People want to leave,
and in the middle of the chaos,

818
00:30:07,381 --> 00:30:10,380
in the midst of all of this,
I'll never forget.

819
00:30:10,381 --> 00:30:13,380
A Middle Eastern man
maybe four rows behind me

820
00:30:13,381 --> 00:30:16,380
dressed in very traditional
garb,

821
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:17,421
he stands up

822
00:30:17,422 --> 00:30:20,380
and he sticks his head
into the conversation being had

823
00:30:20,381 --> 00:30:22,380
between the air hostess

824
00:30:22,381 --> 00:30:24,380
and the safety official,
and he goes,

825
00:30:24,381 --> 00:30:27,380
"Excuse me. Pardon me.
Sorry to interrupt.

826
00:30:27,381 --> 00:30:30,380
"I couldn't help noticing
what you are talking.

827
00:30:30,381 --> 00:30:33,380
"I just want to say
maybe you want to check.

828
00:30:33,381 --> 00:30:35,380
"I noticed that gentleman over
there was coughing little bit,

829
00:30:35,381 --> 00:30:38,380
"and then he never liked
anything [indistinct].

830
00:30:38,381 --> 00:30:40,380
"Yeah, I thought
he was wearing a hood.

831
00:30:40,381 --> 00:30:42,380
"Something about him,
I don't know.

832
00:30:42,381 --> 00:30:44,380
"Something just made me
a little bit uncomfortable.

833
00:30:44,381 --> 00:30:45,380
"I thought maybe you want to
check. There, I said.

834
00:30:45,381 --> 00:30:48,380
"You know--you know
what they say, see something,

835
00:30:48,381 --> 00:30:50,380
"say something, yeah.

836
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:54,380
Just maybe you check there."

837
00:30:54,381 --> 00:30:58,380
[laughter]

838
00:30:58,381 --> 00:31:01,380
I'm like, "Really?

839
00:31:01,381 --> 00:31:03,380
Et tu Ahmed."

840
00:31:03,381 --> 00:31:06,380
[laughter]

841
00:31:06,381 --> 00:31:10,380
[cheers and applause]

842
00:31:10,381 --> 00:31:14,380
How the wheel has turned,
my friend.

843
00:31:14,381 --> 00:31:17,380
You quickly forget
there was a time

844
00:31:17,381 --> 00:31:20,380
when Muslims were
the black people of the sky.

845
00:31:20,381 --> 00:31:21,380
[laughter]

846
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:25,380
And yet, now
you have deserted me.

847
00:31:25,381 --> 00:31:28,380
'Cause I thought
he'd be on my side.

848
00:31:28,381 --> 00:31:31,380
I thought if anyone understood
what it would be like

849
00:31:31,381 --> 00:31:34,380
to be stigmatized,
it would be that man.

850
00:31:34,381 --> 00:31:37,380
You know, I thought
we shared something.

851
00:31:37,381 --> 00:31:39,380
I thought he'd look over and be
like, "Don't worry, brother.

852
00:31:39,381 --> 00:31:41,380
I got your back."

853
00:31:41,381 --> 00:31:43,380
Instead, he sold me
down the river,

854
00:31:43,381 --> 00:31:47,380
threw me under the bus, like,
"Hey, it's your turn now.

855
00:31:47,381 --> 00:31:49,380
I'm free, bitches."

856
00:31:49,381 --> 00:31:52,380
[laughter]

857
00:31:52,381 --> 00:31:55,380
And he was. I don't blame him.
He was.

858
00:31:55,381 --> 00:31:58,380
'Cause Ebola was one of the
craziest things I've ever seen

859
00:31:58,381 --> 00:32:01,380
in terms of the human condition,

860
00:32:01,381 --> 00:32:04,380
how quickly we're taught
to panic.

861
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:07,380
You know, one minute
I'll be flying

862
00:32:07,381 --> 00:32:09,380
and I'll see people
of Middle Eastern descent

863
00:32:09,381 --> 00:32:12,380
getting pulled, you know,
random selections

864
00:32:12,381 --> 00:32:13,380
beeping through the machine.

865
00:32:13,381 --> 00:32:15,380
And then Ebola happened,

866
00:32:15,381 --> 00:32:18,380
and all of a sudden
the focus shift--

867
00:32:18,381 --> 00:32:19,380
The focus shifted,
and now it was Africans

868
00:32:19,381 --> 00:32:22,380
being pulled aside,
Africans waiting.

869
00:32:22,381 --> 00:32:25,381
Middle Easterners were cruising
through security.

870
00:32:27,381 --> 00:32:30,380
And then almost as quickly
as it started,

871
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:31,380
it flipped back overnight.

872
00:32:31,381 --> 00:32:33,541
And I'll never forget
when it happened.

873
00:32:33,542 --> 00:32:37,380
Right after the "Charlie Hebdo"
attack in Paris.

874
00:32:37,381 --> 00:32:40,380
That attack happened,

875
00:32:40,381 --> 00:32:43,380
and almost the next day

876
00:32:43,381 --> 00:32:45,380
Ebola wasn't a thing anymore.

877
00:32:45,381 --> 00:32:48,380
Middle Easterners were back
in the spotlight.

878
00:32:48,381 --> 00:32:51,380
Normal service had been resumed.

879
00:32:51,381 --> 00:32:54,380
'Cause after "Charlie Hebdo,"
I would walk through airports

880
00:32:54,381 --> 00:32:55,380
and no one gave a damn.

881
00:32:55,381 --> 00:32:58,380
They didn't care about me,
where I was from,

882
00:32:58,381 --> 00:33:01,380
nor the bananas in my bag.

883
00:33:01,381 --> 00:33:04,380
[laughter]

884
00:33:04,381 --> 00:33:08,380
[applause]

885
00:33:08,381 --> 00:33:12,381
I just--I just cruised
through security.

886
00:33:13,381 --> 00:33:15,380
"Charlie Hebdo."

887
00:33:15,381 --> 00:33:17,380
"Terrorist attack in France."

888
00:33:17,381 --> 00:33:19,380
Everyone led with it.
CNN, "Breaking news.

889
00:33:19,381 --> 00:33:21,380
Terrorists have attacked
'Charlie Hebdo' headquarters."

890
00:33:21,381 --> 00:33:23,380
BBC, "And in breaking news,
unconfirmed report says--saying

891
00:33:23,381 --> 00:33:24,380
12 people have been killed by
terrorists who've attacked"--

892
00:33:24,381 --> 00:33:25,380
Everyone said
they were terrorists.

893
00:33:25,381 --> 00:33:27,380
It was weird to me

894
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:28,380
'cause we didn't know
that they were terrorists.

895
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,380
We just knew that
they were Middle Eastern.

896
00:33:30,381 --> 00:33:32,380
But immediately
we went to terrorist,

897
00:33:32,381 --> 00:33:34,380
because if you're Middle Eastern
that's a terrorist.

898
00:33:34,381 --> 00:33:36,380
That's the world we live in now.

899
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:38,380
Yeah, if you're Middle Eastern,

900
00:33:38,381 --> 00:33:40,380
terrorism is your trademark.

901
00:33:40,381 --> 00:33:42,380
It's so crazy how easy it is
to get people

902
00:33:42,381 --> 00:33:44,380
to hate a group of people,
'cause that's what happened.

903
00:33:44,381 --> 00:33:46,380
"Charlie Hebdo," and then
everyone started saying things

904
00:33:46,381 --> 00:33:47,380
about Muslims.

905
00:33:47,381 --> 00:33:50,380
"These damn Muslims. These
damn--We gotta stop Islam.

906
00:33:50,381 --> 00:33:53,380
"That's what we gotta do.
We gotta stop these Islamists.

907
00:33:53,381 --> 00:33:54,380
"These Muslims.

908
00:33:54,381 --> 00:33:57,380
"Now, I'm not saying all Muslims
are terrorists,

909
00:33:57,381 --> 00:34:00,380
but all terrorists are Muslims."

910
00:34:00,381 --> 00:34:02,380
It sounds really smart,
doesn't it?

911
00:34:02,381 --> 00:34:04,380
Sounds really smart,
but it's not.

912
00:34:04,381 --> 00:34:05,380
It's stupid
and it's hate speech.

913
00:34:05,381 --> 00:34:08,380
That's what it is. It really is.

914
00:34:08,381 --> 00:34:11,381
[cheers and applause]

915
00:34:16,381 --> 00:34:19,380
Terrorism is not a race,
it's an act.

916
00:34:19,381 --> 00:34:21,380
It evolved over time.

917
00:34:21,381 --> 00:34:23,380
Yes, right now we're dealing
with extremism,

918
00:34:23,381 --> 00:34:25,380
Islamic terror in some parts
of the world.

919
00:34:25,381 --> 00:34:27,380
But if you go to other parts
of the world

920
00:34:27,381 --> 00:34:28,380
and ask them
what a terrorist is,

921
00:34:28,381 --> 00:34:30,380
they'll show you
a different face.

922
00:34:30,381 --> 00:34:32,380
You go to England 20 years ago

923
00:34:32,381 --> 00:34:33,380
and you said,
"What's a terrorist?"

924
00:34:33,381 --> 00:34:37,380
They'd show you
a drunk Irishman, right.

925
00:34:37,381 --> 00:34:40,380
I didn't need to say drunk.
I could have just said Irishman.

926
00:34:40,381 --> 00:34:42,380
[laughter and applause]

927
00:34:42,381 --> 00:34:44,380
There was a time when--

928
00:34:44,381 --> 00:34:46,380
when Nelson Mandela
was labeled a terrorist.

929
00:34:46,381 --> 00:34:48,380
Like, terrorism is an act,
it's not a face.

930
00:34:48,381 --> 00:34:51,380
People say these things,
"Well, these Muslims,

931
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:53,380
"you gotta admit,
there's an awful lot of them.

932
00:34:53,381 --> 00:34:55,380
Awful lot of them
doing the same thing."

933
00:34:55,381 --> 00:34:59,380
I'm like, "Yeah, but you know
who's not terrorists?

934
00:34:59,381 --> 00:35:01,380
Most Muslims."

935
00:35:01,381 --> 00:35:05,380
Yeah, most Muslims
are not terrorists.

936
00:35:05,381 --> 00:35:08,380
I'm not even Muslim,
but it gets to me,

937
00:35:08,381 --> 00:35:11,380
because I'm like most Muslim
people are not terrorists.

938
00:35:11,381 --> 00:35:12,380
You know how you know this?

939
00:35:12,381 --> 00:35:14,380
Because we're still alive, yeah.

940
00:35:14,381 --> 00:35:16,380
They've had ample opportunity
to take us out, people.

941
00:35:16,381 --> 00:35:18,380
There's a billion Muslim people
on the planet.

942
00:35:18,381 --> 00:35:20,380
They've had every chance.

943
00:35:20,381 --> 00:35:22,380
They could have killed us
using those falafels

944
00:35:22,381 --> 00:35:24,380
they sell us after midnight
when we come out of the club.

945
00:35:24,381 --> 00:35:27,380
They could have
wiped us all out

946
00:35:27,381 --> 00:35:32,380
with their killer kebabs.

947
00:35:32,381 --> 00:35:33,380
They've had the means.

948
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:36,380
It's so weird to see
our prejudices, you know,

949
00:35:36,381 --> 00:35:38,380
the way people are labeled
in the media, in society.

950
00:35:38,381 --> 00:35:39,380
It's not just Muslim people.

951
00:35:39,381 --> 00:35:41,380
You see it with black people
as well, you know.

952
00:35:41,381 --> 00:35:43,380
People saying these things like,
you know, I remember

953
00:35:43,381 --> 00:35:44,380
when the--when the riots
were happening in Baltimore.

954
00:35:44,381 --> 00:35:46,380
People quickly jumped,
"These thugs.

955
00:35:46,381 --> 00:35:48,380
"These are a bunch of thugs
running around. These thugs.

956
00:35:48,381 --> 00:35:50,380
"You know, I'm starting to think
that black people like crime.

957
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:51,380
"That's what I'm starting
to think.

958
00:35:51,381 --> 00:35:53,380
"Is that the only way
they can deal with it?

959
00:35:53,381 --> 00:35:54,380
Black people like crime."

960
00:35:54,381 --> 00:35:58,380
No, no, black people
don't like crime,

961
00:35:58,381 --> 00:36:00,380
because you know
who's not a criminal?

962
00:36:00,381 --> 00:36:01,861
Most black people.

963
00:36:01,862 --> 00:36:04,380
Yeah, most black people
are not criminals.

964
00:36:04,381 --> 00:36:06,380
[cheers and applause]

965
00:36:06,381 --> 00:36:09,380
Black people hate crime
just like everybody else.

966
00:36:09,381 --> 00:36:12,380
It's not like black people
are cheering crime on.

967
00:36:12,381 --> 00:36:13,380
It's not like they're watching
a black guy do some shit.

968
00:36:13,381 --> 00:36:16,380
Like, "Yeah, Darnell,
you steal that shit, man.

969
00:36:16,381 --> 00:36:18,380
You steal that shit. Yeah!"
No.

970
00:36:18,381 --> 00:36:20,380
When black people see
a black person doing a crime,

971
00:36:20,381 --> 00:36:23,380
they're also looking
at the person like,

972
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:25,380
"That nigger crazy!"

973
00:36:25,381 --> 00:36:27,380
You gotta fight the act,
not the face,

974
00:36:27,381 --> 00:36:30,380
not a face that you put the--
It's not the--

975
00:36:30,381 --> 00:36:32,380
It's not the same thing,
and everybody has it, you know.

976
00:36:32,381 --> 00:36:34,380
If you're Middle Eastern
and you do something,

977
00:36:34,381 --> 00:36:36,380
if you're a black person--
black person gets shot

978
00:36:36,381 --> 00:36:38,380
in a bad neighborhood, the first
story they always lead with--

979
00:36:38,381 --> 00:36:40,380
Always lead with the same thing.

980
00:36:40,381 --> 00:36:43,380
"And today in Compton, a man was
shot in what is suspected

981
00:36:43,381 --> 00:36:45,380
to be gang-related violence."

982
00:36:45,381 --> 00:36:46,380
It's always
gang-related violence.

983
00:36:46,381 --> 00:36:48,380
It never says anything else.
They were just two guys.

984
00:36:48,381 --> 00:36:49,380
Gang-related,
probably gang-related.

985
00:36:49,381 --> 00:36:52,380
"Why do you say that?"
"Well, because, you know,

986
00:36:52,381 --> 00:36:56,380
in this area there's...
hip-hop."

987
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:58,380
Why is it gang-related?
It's always gang--

988
00:36:58,381 --> 00:36:59,380
It doesn't matter who it is.

989
00:36:59,381 --> 00:37:01,380
Could be two kids,
someone got shot,

990
00:37:01,381 --> 00:37:03,380
"A three-year-old was shot today
by a four-year-old

991
00:37:03,381 --> 00:37:06,380
in what is suspected to be
gang-related violence."

992
00:37:06,381 --> 00:37:09,380
"But they're kids."
"Yeah, they recruit very young."

993
00:37:09,381 --> 00:37:10,380
"It wasn't a mistake?"
"No, it's not a mistake.

994
00:37:10,381 --> 00:37:12,380
It's never a mistake."

995
00:37:12,381 --> 00:37:14,380
But if it's in a rich
neighborhood, the story changes,

996
00:37:14,381 --> 00:37:16,380
'cause you'll never hear them
reporting the same thing

997
00:37:16,381 --> 00:37:17,380
about the Hamptons.

998
00:37:17,381 --> 00:37:19,380
"And today in the Hamptons,
a man was shot

999
00:37:19,381 --> 00:37:21,380
"in what is suspected to be
gang-related violence.

1000
00:37:21,381 --> 00:37:23,380
"The Burberry gang have been
known to operate

1001
00:37:23,381 --> 00:37:25,380
around these parts
and recently"--

1002
00:37:25,381 --> 00:37:27,380
They never say those things.

1003
00:37:27,381 --> 00:37:29,380
In fact, you're more likely
to see the police commissioner

1004
00:37:29,381 --> 00:37:32,380
going, "A lot--We've just
conducted an investigation.

1005
00:37:32,381 --> 00:37:36,380
"We found out that a firearm was
discharged earlier today

1006
00:37:36,381 --> 00:37:41,380
"and the bullet left
the--the weapon...

1007
00:37:41,381 --> 00:37:45,380
"penetrating a victim,
and we're gonna investigate

1008
00:37:45,381 --> 00:37:47,380
whether--whether
it was misfired or"--

1009
00:37:47,381 --> 00:37:50,380
"I'm sorry, did you say--
Did someone shoot the gun?"

1010
00:37:50,381 --> 00:37:52,380
"Well, we're not--we're not
ruling anything out right now,

1011
00:37:52,381 --> 00:37:55,380
"but--but we're checking to see
if there was a mechanism failure

1012
00:37:55,381 --> 00:37:57,380
or"--
"What about the person?"

1013
00:37:57,381 --> 00:37:59,380
"Well, we--we don't think that
this was intentional.

1014
00:37:59,381 --> 00:38:01,380
We don't"--
"So wait, we live in a world

1015
00:38:01,381 --> 00:38:03,380
"where you investigate a gun
before you investigate

1016
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:05,380
a rich white man,
is that what you're saying?"

1017
00:38:05,381 --> 00:38:08,380
"No, no, no. No, that--
That's not what we're saying.

1018
00:38:08,381 --> 00:38:09,621
"But I mean, you must remember,
the gun is black,

1019
00:38:09,622 --> 00:38:11,380
"but that's not the point.

1020
00:38:11,381 --> 00:38:14,380
The point is"--

1021
00:38:14,381 --> 00:38:18,380
[cheers and applause]

1022
00:38:18,381 --> 00:38:19,380
It's so weird
how our prejudices

1023
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:21,380
have given everyone their lane.

1024
00:38:21,381 --> 00:38:24,380
Middle Easterner does something,
they're a terrorist.

1025
00:38:24,381 --> 00:38:26,380
Black person does something,
they're gang-related,

1026
00:38:26,381 --> 00:38:28,380
they're a thug.

1027
00:38:28,381 --> 00:38:30,380
But if a white guy walks into a
church killing nine people dead,

1028
00:38:30,381 --> 00:38:31,380
what do they lead with
on the news?

1029
00:38:31,381 --> 00:38:34,380
"And today
in an isolated incident

1030
00:38:34,381 --> 00:38:36,380
"a lone gunman
walked into a church,

1031
00:38:36,381 --> 00:38:38,380
opening fire
and killing nine people."

1032
00:38:38,381 --> 00:38:40,380
It's always a lone gunman, yeah.

1033
00:38:40,381 --> 00:38:42,380
"A lone gunman with no ties
to society whatsoever."

1034
00:38:42,381 --> 00:38:44,380
They always separate him
as quickly as possible.

1035
00:38:44,381 --> 00:38:46,380
I love how they do that.

1036
00:38:46,381 --> 00:38:48,380
"He kept to himself
and was notoriously unfriendly.

1037
00:38:48,381 --> 00:38:51,380
He had no friends whatsoever."

1038
00:38:51,381 --> 00:38:53,380
No, no friends, really?
No, no friends?

1039
00:38:53,381 --> 00:38:56,380
Not even one?
Not even one?

1040
00:38:56,381 --> 00:38:57,380
[cheers and applause]

1041
00:38:57,381 --> 00:39:02,380
No friends?

1042
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:03,380
I--

1043
00:39:03,381 --> 00:39:05,380
Not even on Facebook?

1044
00:39:05,381 --> 00:39:07,380
No, everyone has friends
on Facebook, come on.

1045
00:39:07,381 --> 00:39:09,380
You're telling me
the guy had no friends.

1046
00:39:09,381 --> 00:39:10,380
It's almost like as the shooting
happens, everyone's like,

1047
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:12,380
"What? Dillon? Unfriend,
unfriend, unfriend, unfriend,

1048
00:39:12,381 --> 00:39:15,380
unfriend, unfriend, unfriend,
unfriend, unfriend."

1049
00:39:15,381 --> 00:39:18,380
It's the weirdest thing ever.

1050
00:39:18,381 --> 00:39:23,380
And the first thing they always
go to is mental instability.

1051
00:39:23,381 --> 00:39:24,380
That's what they go to,
the first thing.

1052
00:39:24,381 --> 00:39:26,380
They never go with terrorism.

1053
00:39:26,381 --> 00:39:28,380
"What happened? Are we--are we
saying this was terrorism?"

1054
00:39:28,381 --> 00:39:30,380
"Whoa, wait. We're not gonna
jump to that conclusion.

1055
00:39:30,381 --> 00:39:32,261
"This was a young man who was
really mentally--

1056
00:39:32,262 --> 00:39:36,380
He was unstable.
He was a troubled young man."

1057
00:39:36,381 --> 00:39:38,380
But he was a terrorist 'cause he
committed a terrorist act.

1058
00:39:38,381 --> 00:39:40,380
He walked into a building,
shot a bunch of people

1059
00:39:40,381 --> 00:39:42,380
to try to spread a message
of hatred, right.

1060
00:39:42,381 --> 00:39:46,380
He was trying to pass something.
He was trying to do something.

1061
00:39:46,381 --> 00:39:48,380
That's an act of terror.

1062
00:39:48,381 --> 00:39:52,380
"Now, well--well, look.
No, not necessarily.

1063
00:39:52,381 --> 00:39:54,380
He was a troubled young man."

1064
00:39:54,381 --> 00:39:57,380
"Yes, and a terrorist."

1065
00:39:57,381 --> 00:39:59,380
"Yeah, but he was
mentally unstable."

1066
00:39:59,381 --> 00:40:01,380
"Just like terrorists."

1067
00:40:01,381 --> 00:40:03,380
That's exactly
what a terrorist is.

1068
00:40:03,381 --> 00:40:05,380
There's no normal reason
to blow yourself up.

1069
00:40:05,381 --> 00:40:08,380
That is ridiculous as shit.

1070
00:40:08,381 --> 00:40:10,380
You're crazy.

1071
00:40:10,381 --> 00:40:13,380
[cheers and applause]

1072
00:40:13,381 --> 00:40:15,380
You're crazy,

1073
00:40:15,381 --> 00:40:17,380
but you're still a terrorist.

1074
00:40:17,381 --> 00:40:19,380
It's weird. It's almost like
without realizing it,

1075
00:40:19,381 --> 00:40:20,380
what they're saying
on the news is,

1076
00:40:20,381 --> 00:40:22,380
"You know, this young white man

1077
00:40:22,381 --> 00:40:25,380
"is clearly struggling
with something.

1078
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:29,380
"I mean, because why would you
forgo all that privilege?

1079
00:40:29,381 --> 00:40:32,380
Why would you"--
[laughter]

1080
00:40:32,381 --> 00:40:33,380
"I mean,
he was a young white man.

1081
00:40:33,381 --> 00:40:35,380
"Why would you throw that
all away by--

1082
00:40:35,381 --> 00:40:39,380
"I mean, if he was a minority, I
get it, 'cause that shit sucks.

1083
00:40:39,381 --> 00:40:42,380
But I mean, why would you
throw it--He must be crazy."

1084
00:40:42,381 --> 00:40:44,380
[laughter]

1085
00:40:44,381 --> 00:40:46,380
This is madness.
I refuse to be part of this.

1086
00:40:46,381 --> 00:40:49,380
I refuse to live in a world
who will deny white people,

1087
00:40:49,381 --> 00:40:52,380
the moniker of terrorist.

1088
00:40:52,381 --> 00:40:55,380
That's racism, people,
that's what that is.

1089
00:40:55,381 --> 00:40:57,380
If a white man, through hard
work and determination,

1090
00:40:57,381 --> 00:40:58,380
commits an act of terror,

1091
00:40:58,381 --> 00:41:00,380
he deserves to be called
a terrorist.

1092
00:41:00,381 --> 00:41:02,380
He worked for it, damn it.
You don't deprive him of that

1093
00:41:02,381 --> 00:41:04,380
because of the color
of his skin.

1094
00:41:04,381 --> 00:41:07,380
You give it to him
and you put him up there.

1095
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:10,380
Bin Waleed and Charlie.

1096
00:41:10,381 --> 00:41:12,380
It's terrorism.

1097
00:41:12,381 --> 00:41:14,380
We all--we all have our
prejudices, don't get me wrong.

1098
00:41:14,381 --> 00:41:16,380
It's not like I--
You know, I try to be better.

1099
00:41:16,381 --> 00:41:18,380
I really do.
I realize every now and again

1100
00:41:18,381 --> 00:41:21,380
I do things that I'm not
particularly proud of, you know.

1101
00:41:21,381 --> 00:41:24,380
Like, for instance,
whenever I fly into America,

1102
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:28,380
if I've been out of the country
and flying back into America,

1103
00:41:28,381 --> 00:41:32,380
I always try to fly
on Middle Eastern airlines

1104
00:41:32,381 --> 00:41:35,380
specifically.

1105
00:41:35,381 --> 00:41:38,380
So I'll fly on Emirates or Qatar
or Etihad or one of those.

1106
00:41:38,381 --> 00:41:41,380
And the reason I do this

1107
00:41:41,381 --> 00:41:45,380
is because I feel
there's less chance...

1108
00:41:45,381 --> 00:41:47,380
[laughter]

1109
00:41:47,381 --> 00:41:50,380
That somebody--

1110
00:41:50,381 --> 00:41:53,380
[laughter]

1111
00:41:53,381 --> 00:41:56,381
[applause]

1112
00:41:56,382 --> 00:41:59,380
That some--And this may sound a
little bit racist,

1113
00:41:59,381 --> 00:42:01,380
You have every right
to be offended, you really--

1114
00:42:01,381 --> 00:42:03,380
But I feel like there's less
chance that somebody

1115
00:42:03,381 --> 00:42:07,380
will attack one of those planes,

1116
00:42:07,381 --> 00:42:09,380
for--for a few reasons.

1117
00:42:09,381 --> 00:42:11,380
Number one, because they're
not proving a point.

1118
00:42:11,381 --> 00:42:14,380
The plane's already
Muslim owned, Muslim run.

1119
00:42:14,381 --> 00:42:16,380
They're not converting anybody.

1120
00:42:16,381 --> 00:42:18,380
And secondly,
and more importantly on my side,

1121
00:42:18,381 --> 00:42:19,380
I think there's a small chance

1122
00:42:19,381 --> 00:42:21,380
somebody could defuse
the situation.

1123
00:42:21,381 --> 00:42:23,380
Someone could talk them down

1124
00:42:23,381 --> 00:42:25,380
just because they speak
the same language, yeah.

1125
00:42:25,381 --> 00:42:26,380
That's--that's half of terror
for me

1126
00:42:26,381 --> 00:42:29,380
is the fact that you don't
understand what the person says.

1127
00:42:29,381 --> 00:42:30,380
The guy's speaking Arabic.

1128
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:33,380
Arabic, it puts fear
in the hearts of all men.

1129
00:42:33,381 --> 00:42:36,380
[imitating Arabic]

1130
00:42:36,381 --> 00:42:38,380
You never think good things
when you hear Arabic.

1131
00:42:38,381 --> 00:42:40,380
Yeah, we watch--we watch
too many movies and TV shows.

1132
00:42:40,381 --> 00:42:42,380
Like, you--whenever
you hear Arabic,

1133
00:42:42,381 --> 00:42:43,380
then some bad shit happens
immediately.

1134
00:42:43,381 --> 00:42:44,380
That's always what happens.

1135
00:42:44,381 --> 00:42:46,380
[imitating Arabic]

1136
00:42:46,381 --> 00:42:47,380
[imitates explosion]

1137
00:42:47,381 --> 00:42:49,380
It's never something cool
or sexy.

1138
00:42:49,381 --> 00:42:52,380
It's never like,
[imitating Arabic]

1139
00:42:52,381 --> 00:42:54,380
[whooshes]

1140
00:42:54,381 --> 00:42:56,380
It's never that.

1141
00:42:56,381 --> 00:42:59,380
And so it makes you think, it
makes you think a certain way.

1142
00:42:59,381 --> 00:43:01,380
I know--I know
I'm not any different.

1143
00:43:01,381 --> 00:43:04,380
I was on a flight,
my first Middle Eastern flight,

1144
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:07,380
flying on an Emirates plane,

1145
00:43:07,381 --> 00:43:10,380
and this man emerged
from the galley.

1146
00:43:10,381 --> 00:43:12,380
He had a long beard
and he was carrying a box,

1147
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:13,380
and he just went off,
he was like,

1148
00:43:13,381 --> 00:43:16,380
[imitating Arabic]

1149
00:43:16,381 --> 00:43:19,380
And I was like, "Aah!"

1150
00:43:19,381 --> 00:43:22,380
[screaming]

1151
00:43:22,381 --> 00:43:25,380
[scream fades]

1152
00:43:25,381 --> 00:43:29,380
Chicken, please.

1153
00:43:29,381 --> 00:43:32,380
Chicken.

1154
00:43:32,381 --> 00:43:34,380
Sorry, I--

1155
00:43:34,381 --> 00:43:37,380
I get really excited
with chicken.

1156
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:39,380
I'm--I'm sorry for that.

1157
00:43:39,381 --> 00:43:41,380
Sorry.

1158
00:43:41,381 --> 00:43:44,380
"That, my friend, excited?
You looked petrified."

1159
00:43:44,381 --> 00:43:48,380
I said, "I am, of the flavor.

1160
00:43:48,381 --> 00:43:50,380
"Chicken, wah!

1161
00:43:50,381 --> 00:43:52,380
I love chicken.
I love chicken so much."

1162
00:43:52,381 --> 00:43:56,380
He's like, "Oh, is that the--
is that the black thing?"

1163
00:43:56,381 --> 00:43:58,380
I said, "That's racist."

1164
00:43:58,381 --> 00:44:01,381
[laughter]

1165
00:44:03,381 --> 00:44:05,380
It's just--
it's just a little thing

1166
00:44:05,381 --> 00:44:06,380
that makes me think
there's a chance

1167
00:44:06,381 --> 00:44:08,380
that if someone understands
the language

1168
00:44:08,381 --> 00:44:10,380
they may be able
to talk the guy down.

1169
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:13,380
You--there could be. There could
be a terrorist on the plane.

1170
00:44:13,381 --> 00:44:15,380
Guy with a suicide vest.

1171
00:44:15,381 --> 00:44:18,380
We'll be flying
40,000 feet in the sky.

1172
00:44:18,381 --> 00:44:20,380
Man jumps off, losing his head.

1173
00:44:20,381 --> 00:44:24,380
There he is,
[imitating Arabic]

1174
00:44:24,381 --> 00:44:27,380
And just maybe, maybe some guy
will be opposite him like,

1175
00:44:27,381 --> 00:44:29,380
"Hey!

1176
00:44:29,381 --> 00:44:32,380
What are you doing?"

1177
00:44:32,381 --> 00:44:35,380
"I'm going to blow up this plane
to show everybody

1178
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:39,380
that Allah is great!"

1179
00:44:39,381 --> 00:44:42,380
"Yeah, but...

1180
00:44:42,381 --> 00:44:44,380
we know this."

1181
00:44:44,381 --> 00:44:47,380
[laughter]

1182
00:44:47,381 --> 00:44:51,380
"Everybody here knows this.
So what are you doing?"

1183
00:44:51,381 --> 00:44:53,380
"I wanted to show all of you
the power of--"

1184
00:44:53,381 --> 00:44:55,380
"What are you showing us
if we already know, huh?

1185
00:44:55,381 --> 00:44:57,380
"What are you showing us?
Are you saying

1186
00:44:57,381 --> 00:44:58,380
"we are not good Muslims, is
that what you are saying, huh?

1187
00:44:58,381 --> 00:45:00,380
"Are you saying we do not know
the power of Allah?

1188
00:45:00,381 --> 00:45:02,380
"Is that what you are saying?

1189
00:45:02,381 --> 00:45:04,380
You are saying we are bad
Muslims. What are you saying?"

1190
00:45:04,381 --> 00:45:05,380
"No, my friend, please, I was
not trying to offend you.

1191
00:45:05,381 --> 00:45:07,380
"I was just trying to kill you.

1192
00:45:07,381 --> 00:45:08,380
Listen to what I
wanted to show you."

1193
00:45:08,381 --> 00:45:09,380
"What are you showing me, huh?

1194
00:45:09,381 --> 00:45:11,380
"Are you saying I do not pray,
is that what you are saying?

1195
00:45:11,381 --> 00:45:12,380
"You're a better Muslim than me?

1196
00:45:12,381 --> 00:45:14,380
"You think I'm not good Muslim
just because

1197
00:45:14,381 --> 00:45:16,380
"I'm watching "Cloudy with
a Chance of Meatballs,

1198
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:18,380
is that what you think, huh?
What are you saying?"

1199
00:45:18,381 --> 00:45:19,501
"No, I'm not saying that.
I wanted to--"

1200
00:45:19,502 --> 00:45:22,380
"What are you show--You show
nothing. You make us look bad.

1201
00:45:22,381 --> 00:45:24,380
"Why don't you preach? Why
don't you talk to people, huh?

1202
00:45:24,381 --> 00:45:26,380
"This is not Islam. What are you
doing with your stupid dress?

1203
00:45:26,381 --> 00:45:30,380
Blah blah blah, blah blah blah.
You make us all look bad."

1204
00:45:30,381 --> 00:45:32,380
"No, no, I was not--"
"No, you're not trying nothing.

1205
00:45:32,381 --> 00:45:34,380
"No, you even got
your vest backward.

1206
00:45:34,381 --> 00:45:36,380
You don't even know
what you are doing here."

1207
00:45:36,381 --> 00:45:39,380
"Sorry, it's my first time.
I never done this before."

1208
00:45:39,381 --> 00:45:43,380
"Yeah, yes, story, story. Sit
down, shut up, eat something."

1209
00:45:43,381 --> 00:45:44,380
"I don't know if I can--"
"No, it's all challah.

1210
00:45:44,381 --> 00:45:46,380
"You can eat it.
Don't worry, you can eat it.

1211
00:45:46,381 --> 00:45:48,380
"You can eat it.
[indistinct]

1212
00:45:48,381 --> 00:45:50,380
Stupid."

1213
00:45:50,381 --> 00:45:53,380
There's a small chance
that could happen.

1214
00:45:53,381 --> 00:45:55,380
And that's why I do it.

1215
00:45:55,381 --> 00:45:58,380
[cheers and applause]

1216
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:00,380
I'll do anything

1217
00:46:00,381 --> 00:46:04,380
that makes my flying experience
a little bit more comfortable.

1218
00:46:04,381 --> 00:46:07,380
Ah, you guys are fun, man.

1219
00:46:07,381 --> 00:46:09,380
You really are.

1220
00:46:09,381 --> 00:46:11,380
Thank you very much
for coming out.

1221
00:46:11,381 --> 00:46:13,380
Thank you. I appreciate it.

1222
00:46:13,381 --> 00:46:16,381
[cheers and applause]

1223
00:46:17,381 --> 00:46:19,380
I really appreciate it.

1224
00:46:19,381 --> 00:46:22,380
It means the world to me.

1225
00:46:22,381 --> 00:46:25,380
And I mean that, literally,
it means the world to me.

1226
00:46:25,381 --> 00:46:27,380
Stand-up comedy changed my life
forever.

1227
00:46:27,381 --> 00:46:30,380
I don't think I would have ever
had the opportunity to travel.

1228
00:46:30,381 --> 00:46:32,380
Grew up in Soweto
in South Africa.

1229
00:46:32,381 --> 00:46:36,380
[cheers and applause]

1230
00:46:36,381 --> 00:46:38,380
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

1231
00:46:38,381 --> 00:46:40,380
I didn't choose it,
but thank you.

1232
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:41,380
[laughter]

1233
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:45,380
I don't say it in like a--
like a sob story way, you know.

1234
00:46:45,381 --> 00:46:48,380
'Cause everyone was poor
in Soweto,

1235
00:46:48,381 --> 00:46:49,380
which was cool, you know.

1236
00:46:49,381 --> 00:46:52,380
Like, when everyone's poor
together, it's cool.

1237
00:46:52,381 --> 00:46:54,380
It's fine, yeah.

1238
00:46:54,381 --> 00:46:56,380
'Cause you don't feel it
as much.

1239
00:46:56,381 --> 00:46:58,380
It's not like anyone can tease
you and be like,

1240
00:46:58,381 --> 00:47:01,380
"Ha ha, you are poor."

1241
00:47:01,381 --> 00:47:04,380
"Yeah, so are you."

1242
00:47:04,381 --> 00:47:07,380
"Ah, this sucks."

1243
00:47:07,381 --> 00:47:08,380
But I would--I probably never
would have traveled the world

1244
00:47:08,381 --> 00:47:10,380
were it not for stand-up comedy,
you know.

1245
00:47:10,381 --> 00:47:12,380
I'm the first person
in my family

1246
00:47:12,381 --> 00:47:14,380
to ever board an airplane.

1247
00:47:14,381 --> 00:47:17,380
First person in my family to
ever get kicked off an airplane.

1248
00:47:17,381 --> 00:47:20,301
I would have never--I would have
never learned about America.

1249
00:47:20,302 --> 00:47:21,380
I would have never come out to
places like Washington, D.C.

1250
00:47:21,381 --> 00:47:23,380
I would have never learned
to travel

1251
00:47:23,381 --> 00:47:24,380
on the other side of the road.

1252
00:47:24,381 --> 00:47:26,380
I would have never learned about
charming racism

1253
00:47:26,381 --> 00:47:30,380
had I not come to
this beautiful country, yeah.

1254
00:47:30,381 --> 00:47:32,380
Probably something
that changed my life forever,

1255
00:47:32,381 --> 00:47:35,380
charming racism.

1256
00:47:35,381 --> 00:47:37,701
Classic American
charming racism.

1257
00:47:37,702 --> 00:47:39,380
[laughter]

1258
00:47:39,381 --> 00:47:41,380
I never knew there was
such a thing, growing up.

1259
00:47:41,381 --> 00:47:43,380
And I thought
I knew all about racism.

1260
00:47:43,381 --> 00:47:45,380
I was, you know,
coming from the home

1261
00:47:45,381 --> 00:47:47,380
of some of the best racism
in the world.

1262
00:47:47,381 --> 00:47:50,380
No, and I don't mean to brag,
but South Africa is, by far--

1263
00:47:50,381 --> 00:47:53,380
Like--like we've got--we've got
top quality racism out there.

1264
00:47:53,381 --> 00:47:54,380
Like, it's handcrafted.

1265
00:47:54,381 --> 00:47:56,380
You don't get racism like that
anymore.

1266
00:47:56,381 --> 00:47:57,380
Like, I've seen racism
all over the world.

1267
00:47:57,381 --> 00:47:59,380
To be honest,
the standards have dropped.

1268
00:47:59,381 --> 00:48:00,380
It's not what it used to be.

1269
00:48:00,381 --> 00:48:02,380
Like, I'm--I'm talking about
quality racism, you know.

1270
00:48:02,381 --> 00:48:04,380
Now, it's cheap
and mass-produced,

1271
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:05,380
probably made in China now.

1272
00:48:05,381 --> 00:48:09,380
I'm talking about real racism.

1273
00:48:09,381 --> 00:48:12,380
And America showed me,
showed me a wonderful, new type.

1274
00:48:12,381 --> 00:48:15,380
You know, I've always considered
myself a racism connoisseur.

1275
00:48:15,381 --> 00:48:17,380
I appreciate the finer racisms
in life.

1276
00:48:17,381 --> 00:48:19,380
Not all racisms,
don't get me wrong.

1277
00:48:19,381 --> 00:48:21,380
I have my favorites.
I have my not-so-favorites.

1278
00:48:21,381 --> 00:48:23,380
You know, like, blatant racism,
I love.

1279
00:48:23,381 --> 00:48:24,380
I love blatant racism.

1280
00:48:24,381 --> 00:48:27,380
You know exactly where you stand
with the person.

1281
00:48:27,381 --> 00:48:30,380
It's often old people that
exhibit blatant racism.

1282
00:48:30,381 --> 00:48:32,380
Yeah, they tell you
exactly how they feel.

1283
00:48:32,381 --> 00:48:34,380
"This is what I think
about you."

1284
00:48:34,381 --> 00:48:37,380
And you're like, "Yeah,
and you're gonna die soon."

1285
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:39,380
I love this.

1286
00:48:39,381 --> 00:48:42,380
We shared.

1287
00:48:42,381 --> 00:48:45,380
There's racisms I don't
particularly care for,

1288
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:48,380
like subtle racism I don't like.

1289
00:48:48,381 --> 00:48:49,380
Really don't like subtle--

1290
00:48:49,381 --> 00:48:52,380
You know where people don't tell
you they're racists.

1291
00:48:52,381 --> 00:48:54,380
They just leave a series
of clues,

1292
00:48:54,381 --> 00:48:57,380
hope you'll figure it out
for yourself.

1293
00:48:57,381 --> 00:49:00,301
I hate that,
who'll say things like,

1294
00:49:00,302 --> 00:49:03,380
"We don't need your people
around here."

1295
00:49:03,381 --> 00:49:06,380
"Who?"

1296
00:49:06,381 --> 00:49:08,380
"Your people."

1297
00:49:08,381 --> 00:49:11,380
"Tall people?"

1298
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:15,380
"No, damn it, your people."

1299
00:49:15,381 --> 00:49:18,380
"Friendly people?"

1300
00:49:18,381 --> 00:49:20,380
"No, I'm talking about your--"

1301
00:49:20,381 --> 00:49:22,380
"Well, I'm not gonna help you.
Say it.

1302
00:49:22,381 --> 00:49:24,380
"If you believe it so much,
say it.

1303
00:49:24,381 --> 00:49:27,380
"Have the balls, stand behind
your convictions. Say it.

1304
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:29,380
"Don't leave a series of clues,
and now I'm working this out.

1305
00:49:29,381 --> 00:49:31,380
"What is this, racism sudoku?
Are you serious?

1306
00:49:31,381 --> 00:49:35,380
Just--just say it. Be proud."

1307
00:49:35,381 --> 00:49:37,380
But don't justify it.

1308
00:49:37,381 --> 00:49:40,380
Rather embrace it, be blatant.

1309
00:49:40,381 --> 00:49:44,380
Or be American and be charming.

1310
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:46,380
I discovered charming racism

1311
00:49:46,381 --> 00:49:48,380
in a place called
Lexington, Kentucky.

1312
00:49:48,381 --> 00:49:50,380
[laughter]

1313
00:49:50,381 --> 00:49:53,380
I don't know if you've ever
been, but you really need to go.

1314
00:49:53,381 --> 00:49:55,380
It's a beautiful place.

1315
00:49:55,381 --> 00:49:58,380
Old-school charming racism
with a smile

1316
00:49:58,381 --> 00:50:00,380
and the tip of a hat.

1317
00:50:00,381 --> 00:50:03,380
Everyone in Lexington had
this vibe, this smile,

1318
00:50:03,381 --> 00:50:05,380
the charm, the drawl--
Oh, the Southern drawl,

1319
00:50:05,381 --> 00:50:07,380
I love it so much, the way
they would speak out there.

1320
00:50:07,381 --> 00:50:10,380
The grammar's horrible,
but it's still beautiful.

1321
00:50:10,381 --> 00:50:12,380
Well, 'cause the sentences
don't really make sense.

1322
00:50:12,381 --> 00:50:14,380
They'd be like, "Y'all ain't
never done gone see none

1323
00:50:14,381 --> 00:50:16,380
of them out"--and it's like,
that's--that's--

1324
00:50:16,381 --> 00:50:19,380
That's not English.
Your autocorrect is broken.

1325
00:50:19,381 --> 00:50:20,380
I don't know what that is,
but it's--but it's beautiful.

1326
00:50:20,381 --> 00:50:22,380
You know, in fact,
when they speak really fast,

1327
00:50:22,381 --> 00:50:24,380
sometimes it sounds like
somebody's playing a banjo

1328
00:50:24,381 --> 00:50:25,380
inside their mouths, that's--

1329
00:50:25,381 --> 00:50:27,821
That's what it sounds like
to me.

1330
00:50:27,822 --> 00:50:30,380
I asked two men for directions,
and this--They started arguing.

1331
00:50:30,381 --> 00:50:32,380
It was the most beautiful sound
I've ever heard in my life.

1332
00:50:32,381 --> 00:50:34,380
The guy was like,
"Where you goin', boy?"

1333
00:50:34,381 --> 00:50:36,380
I said, "I'm going to the--to
the theater. Can you direct me?"

1334
00:50:36,381 --> 00:50:39,380
He said, "Y'all get on the
[indecipherable accent] road.

1335
00:50:39,381 --> 00:50:41,380
[indecipherable accent]
that way."

1336
00:50:41,381 --> 00:50:44,380
The friend was like,

The reason I'll never forget
Lexington, though,

1355

is because I met a woman
out there.

A gorgeous, gorgeous woman.

with some friends,

and she was absolutely stunning.

1361
00:51:55,381 --> 00:51:58,380
A classic Southern belle.

1362
00:51:58,381 --> 00:52:01,380
She had long, big blond hair,

for me, straight for me.

1368
00:52:13,381 --> 00:52:15,380
Came to me, pointed me
in the face, and she was like,

"Excuse me, baby.
Excuse me, honey.

May I chat to you for a moment,
please?"

I said, "Yes, of course.
Hi, hi. How are you?

How are you, ma'am?"

1373

not "handsomest"?
