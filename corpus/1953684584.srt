1
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,462
And to the republic
for which it stands,

2
00:01:56,464 --> 00:01:59,398
one nation under God,

3
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,100
indivisible,

4
00:02:01,102 --> 00:02:03,069
with liberty
and justice for all.

5
00:02:03,071 --> 00:02:05,237
All right, everyone.

6
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:08,239
It is quiz time.
You excited?

7
00:02:08,241 --> 00:02:10,141
No!
Oh, boy.

8
00:02:10,143 --> 00:02:11,910
- Not at all.
- No.

9
00:02:11,912 --> 00:02:13,712
Did anyone
do the reading last night?

10
00:02:13,714 --> 00:02:16,047
Absolutely not.
Mm-hmm.

11
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:18,016
Actually, I read it twice.

12
00:02:18,018 --> 00:02:20,351
Okay.

13
00:02:20,353 --> 00:02:22,353
Okay, after we, uh,
take the quiz,

14
00:02:22,355 --> 00:02:25,290
we'll go over the practice A.P.
essays from last week.

15
00:02:25,292 --> 00:02:28,159
Please pass these down.
Oh, sure.

16
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:32,362
Lanie, if you would
pass these down.

17
00:02:32,364 --> 00:02:34,264
Were the essays any better
this time?

18
00:02:34,266 --> 00:02:36,333
They were, actually.
I was very impressed.

19
00:02:36,335 --> 00:02:38,268
Good.

20
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,871
All right. So...

21
00:02:40,873 --> 00:02:43,173
There are four questions
on the quiz.

22
00:02:43,175 --> 00:02:46,143
A few sentences each,
please.

23
00:02:46,145 --> 00:02:48,378
So, about a half a page?
Yes.

24
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:52,916
Right.
Five lines, or should we do six lines?

25
00:02:52,918 --> 00:02:55,119
Let's just say
half a page, all right?

26
00:02:55,121 --> 00:02:57,286
Smart-ass.
Okay, it's 8:20 now,

27
00:02:57,288 --> 00:03:00,256
so at 8:30,
you may use your books.

28
00:03:00,258 --> 00:03:03,493
At 8:40, pencils down.

29
00:03:03,495 --> 00:03:05,328
Please begin.

30
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:13,903
Lanie, I love you.

31
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:17,440
Can I borrow a book, please?

32
00:03:17,442 --> 00:03:19,075
You may.

33
00:03:19,077 --> 00:03:20,476
Thank you.

34
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:36,158
Ah.

35
00:03:40,196 --> 00:03:41,863
Oh.
Oh.

36
00:03:41,865 --> 00:03:43,999
Ugh.

37
00:03:44,001 --> 00:03:45,400
That was horrible.

38
00:03:45,402 --> 00:03:47,802
Yeah, it's the worst.

39
00:03:48,537 --> 00:03:50,838
Who are you texting?

40
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,873
What?
Who was that?

41
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:55,075
Who was that?
Nothing.

42
00:03:55,077 --> 00:03:57,845
Did I see the name Eric?
Nope.

43
00:03:57,847 --> 00:03:59,413
Have I met Eric?
Nope.

44
00:03:59,415 --> 00:04:01,849
And...
He's nothing.

45
00:04:01,851 --> 00:04:04,185
Uh-huh.
Where did you meet Eric?

46
00:04:04,187 --> 00:04:05,586
Ooh.

47
00:04:05,588 --> 00:04:08,222
At school.

48
00:04:08,224 --> 00:04:11,292
Nice. Very nice.

49
00:04:11,294 --> 00:04:13,893
Mmm.

50
00:04:13,895 --> 00:04:15,595
Have you seen the girls?

51
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:22,426
Hello, madam.
Oh. Hello.

52
00:05:22,428 --> 00:05:25,463
Um... shall we?

53
00:06:11,508 --> 00:06:14,243
Later, gator.
Where you going?

54
00:06:28,854 --> 00:06:29,741
Hi.

55
00:06:30,382 --> 00:06:31,339
Hi.

56
00:06:35,965 --> 00:06:37,665
Oh, my God.

57
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:40,268
When I was in high school,

58
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:44,072
I used to go to have sex
with my boyfriend in his car,

59
00:06:44,074 --> 00:06:47,341
and I'd tell my mom that I
was going to get ice cream.

60
00:06:48,743 --> 00:06:52,045
Then I'd come back
a couple hours later...

61
00:06:52,047 --> 00:06:54,581
with my hair all fucked up.

62
00:07:00,321 --> 00:07:02,656
I can't believe...
She must have known.

63
00:07:02,658 --> 00:07:04,725
She never seemed to know.

64
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,101
I should go.

65
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:23,776
Hey, when do you get back?

66
00:07:23,778 --> 00:07:26,479
Uh, tomorrow.

67
00:07:26,481 --> 00:07:28,280
Night, I think.

68
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,688
Late?
Um, yeah.

69
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,534
I can't wait.

70
00:10:16,476 --> 00:10:18,277
Okay, everyone.

71
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:20,812
Have a fantastic
Thanksgiving.

72
00:10:20,814 --> 00:10:24,483
Don't forget to do your reading.
Catch up to chapter nine.

73
00:10:27,787 --> 00:10:29,788
All right.
Thanks for the advice.

74
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,890
Have a great Thanksgiving.
You too.

75
00:10:34,494 --> 00:10:36,460
And what can I
do for you?

76
00:10:36,462 --> 00:10:38,596
Would you also like
to start a club?

77
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:41,499
Maybe the make-out club?

78
00:10:41,501 --> 00:10:42,900
Shh.

79
00:10:44,636 --> 00:10:47,438
When are you leaving for Houston?
Tomorrow.

80
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,873
Hmm.

81
00:10:56,582 --> 00:10:58,449
Call me later?

82
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:01,218
I will.

83
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,888
Bye, Miss Watts.

84
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,890
Have a happy Thanksgiving.

85
00:11:06,892 --> 00:11:08,959
You too, Mr. Tull.

86
00:11:11,896 --> 00:11:14,531
Yeah. I've got one
in the mix this time.

87
00:11:14,533 --> 00:11:18,401
- She's a good student.
- What are you all whispering about?

88
00:11:18,403 --> 00:11:22,305
Oh, we're talkin' about those kids who got
busted smoking weed in the parking lot.

89
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:25,709
Yeah, and the girl Hayley?
She's in my A.P. Comp class.

90
00:11:25,711 --> 00:11:28,277
Her mom's just gonna
bail her out anyway, so...

91
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:31,347
Well, yeah, she might. Hey, we're
gonna go for a drink after work.

92
00:11:31,349 --> 00:11:33,515
- You wanna come with us?
- Oh, my brother's in town.

93
00:11:33,517 --> 00:11:35,618
I promised him I'd
meet him for a drink, so...

94
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,687
You never mentioned you
had a brother. I know.

95
00:11:38,689 --> 00:11:41,390
I'll see you guys later. Have a
good break. Yeah, you too.

96
00:11:41,392 --> 00:11:43,292
See you.
Thanks.

97
00:11:46,563 --> 00:11:48,597
Hey, Diana. It's Hunter.

98
00:11:48,599 --> 00:11:51,467
Uh, I'm gonna be in Austin
for a meeting.

99
00:11:51,469 --> 00:11:53,768
I know it's been a long time,

100
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:56,938
but, uh, we need to
talk about Mom.

101
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,776
Um, you can't
just avoid this forever.

102
00:12:01,778 --> 00:12:03,745
Okay? Call me.

103
00:12:28,336 --> 00:12:30,671
Di.
Hunter.

104
00:12:30,673 --> 00:12:32,472
Hey.

105
00:12:43,084 --> 00:12:44,984
So how's everything?

106
00:12:48,055 --> 00:12:50,923
It's good.
Mom's good too.

107
00:12:50,925 --> 00:12:53,359
She doesn't always recognize me,

108
00:12:53,361 --> 00:12:56,062
but, uh,

109
00:12:56,064 --> 00:12:57,997
she asks about you.

110
00:13:03,437 --> 00:13:05,404
I'm worried about you.

111
00:13:09,608 --> 00:13:11,943
Okay.

112
00:13:11,945 --> 00:13:15,880
Look, I just, um...
You need to know...

113
00:13:15,882 --> 00:13:19,784
You know, I'm really...
It was really nice of you to call.

114
00:13:19,786 --> 00:13:24,122
Hang on. This has been really fun,
but I've got to go now.

115
00:13:24,124 --> 00:13:27,025
You can get that. I'm sure you
can expense it or something.

116
00:13:27,027 --> 00:13:28,493
Sure.

117
00:14:01,826 --> 00:14:03,493
I don't wanna go.

118
00:14:04,628 --> 00:14:07,163
I just wanna stay here.

119
00:14:07,165 --> 00:14:10,600
Just stay the night. Leave early in
the morning before Dad gets up.

120
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:13,970
I don't mean right now.

121
00:14:16,807 --> 00:14:18,674
I mean this.

122
00:14:18,676 --> 00:14:21,711
Us.
Hmm.

123
00:14:25,915 --> 00:14:27,849
I'm trying to
tell you something.

124
00:14:27,851 --> 00:14:29,918
Okay. What did you
wanna say?

125
00:14:32,188 --> 00:14:34,756
You smell really good.

126
00:14:34,758 --> 00:14:36,758
That's what you're
trying to tell me?

127
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,960
Yep. That was it.

128
00:14:40,496 --> 00:14:42,898
This is the happiest I've been
in a long time.

129
00:14:51,741 --> 00:14:54,708
You know what
really makes me happy?

130
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,477
What's that?

131
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:58,212
This.

132
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:16,496
Does your family do
like a fancy Thanksgiving, or...

133
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:18,531
Oh, no,
not my family.

134
00:15:18,533 --> 00:15:21,234
Can you imagine my dad
being fancy?

135
00:15:21,236 --> 00:15:25,605
Um, but I am gonna introduce you
to some high school friends...

136
00:15:25,607 --> 00:15:27,707
at this party that I
go to every year,

137
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:30,210
so bring something
really cute for that.

138
00:15:30,212 --> 00:15:33,179
There's this guy, Dan... I think
he's someone you should meet.

139
00:15:33,181 --> 00:15:35,215
And Rich,
who's unemployed right now.

140
00:15:35,217 --> 00:15:37,550
But anyway,
they're both really cute...

141
00:15:37,552 --> 00:15:40,786
and I don't know... I dated both
of them a long time ago.

142
00:15:40,788 --> 00:15:45,123
But I just think... I think that either
of them could be great for you.

143
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,759
I mean, Dan is probably
particularly great...

144
00:15:47,761 --> 00:15:50,195
because he is currently
not unemployed,

145
00:15:50,197 --> 00:15:52,764
and he's really creative,

146
00:15:52,766 --> 00:15:55,501
and he's got a couple
of Web properties,

147
00:15:55,503 --> 00:15:58,070
um, so, you know,

148
00:15:58,072 --> 00:15:59,771
kind of a keeper...

149
00:15:59,773 --> 00:16:01,540
someone you could see yourself
going out with.

150
00:16:04,511 --> 00:16:07,011
So, when we were in high school,
actually,

151
00:16:07,013 --> 00:16:09,180
he, uh, did this crazy thing...

152
00:16:09,182 --> 00:16:11,816
- Did you hear what I just said?
- No.

153
00:16:11,818 --> 00:16:14,952
I'm sorry.
I haven't been listening.

154
00:16:14,954 --> 00:16:16,921
Are you kidding me?
I'm sorry.

155
00:16:16,923 --> 00:16:19,290
Okay. Super casual
for Thanksgiving.

156
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:22,927
Bring something cute because I'm taking
you to a party to meet some men.

157
00:16:22,929 --> 00:16:26,697
Okay? Oh, wow. I don't have
anything like that.

158
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:30,234
Something cute. You could wear
a paper bag, and you'd be cute.

159
00:16:30,236 --> 00:16:34,070
But don't.
Something else.

160
00:16:34,072 --> 00:16:36,706
So... what were you saying?

161
00:16:44,248 --> 00:16:46,650
Done, yeah.

162
00:16:46,652 --> 00:16:48,552
This is
definitely offensive.

163
00:16:48,554 --> 00:16:50,921
It might be offensive,
but I think it made a lot of money.

164
00:16:50,923 --> 00:16:52,756
So what?
From who?

165
00:16:52,758 --> 00:16:57,326
I don't know. Anyway... Oh, this is
my lovely roommate Diana, guys.

166
00:16:57,328 --> 00:16:59,128
Hi. Dan.
This is Dan.

167
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:01,030
Hi. Diana. Good to meet you.
How do you do?

168
00:17:01,032 --> 00:17:02,798
Jeff. Jeff? Diana.
Nice to meet you.

169
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,800
Do you want a beer?

170
00:17:04,802 --> 00:17:06,302
I'm good.
Uh, yeah. Sure.

171
00:17:06,304 --> 00:17:09,171
Okay. I'm gonna get you a beer.
Both of you.

172
00:17:09,173 --> 00:17:12,207
Uh, so you're the...
the teacher?

173
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:14,043
Yeah.
Cool. Yeah.

174
00:17:14,045 --> 00:17:18,247
Uh, Sophia was telling me
about that.

175
00:17:18,249 --> 00:17:21,584
Cool.
What do you do?

176
00:17:21,586 --> 00:17:24,118
I run this Web site called
LOL poorpeople. com.

177
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,754
I run a boring Web site.
Hey.

178
00:17:26,756 --> 00:17:28,790
Hi. I'm Rich.
Who are you?

179
00:17:28,792 --> 00:17:31,225
This is, uh,
uh, Diane.

180
00:17:31,227 --> 00:17:33,261
Hi, Diane.
Hi. Diana. Um...

181
00:17:33,263 --> 00:17:34,963
Diana. Okay, sorry. Yeah.
I'm Sophia's roommate.

182
00:17:36,933 --> 00:17:38,733
What do you...
She's a teacher.

183
00:17:38,735 --> 00:17:42,270
Okay. Yeah. I teach English.
High school English.

184
00:17:42,272 --> 00:17:44,205
Oh.

185
00:17:44,207 --> 00:17:48,642
She is totally the teacher that
all the little dudes in high school...

186
00:17:48,644 --> 00:17:50,210
wanted to bang,

187
00:17:50,212 --> 00:17:52,312
but they couldn't bang her
in high school.

188
00:17:52,314 --> 00:17:55,115
No.
No? Sorry.

189
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:57,751
Shit. There's a hair in my beer.
I'll be right back.

190
00:17:59,754 --> 00:18:01,254
There's a hair in your beer?
Yeah.

191
00:18:03,192 --> 00:18:04,825
Hey.
Hey.

192
00:18:04,827 --> 00:18:06,960
How much longer
do you think you wanna stay?

193
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:09,196
A little while.
You wanna stay?

194
00:18:09,198 --> 00:18:12,132
Wanna go? I do.
I'm just really tired.

195
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:14,834
Um, you wanna
take my car?

196
00:18:14,836 --> 00:18:16,936
- Could I?
- Yeah. You can totally take it.

197
00:18:16,938 --> 00:18:19,872
Yeah, I can give you a ride back.
That would be great.

198
00:18:19,874 --> 00:18:21,941
This is the key
to the car,

199
00:18:21,943 --> 00:18:23,676
and that's the key
to the house.

200
00:18:23,678 --> 00:18:25,845
Okay. All right.
Yeah.

201
00:18:25,847 --> 00:18:28,047
See you later. Nice to meet you.
See you at home.

202
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:29,782
Okay.
Be back soon.

203
00:19:09,388 --> 00:19:12,956
<i>Hey, it's Eric. Leave me a message,
and I'll call you back.</i>

204
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,027
Hey.
It's me.

205
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,964
I miss you.

206
00:19:22,467 --> 00:19:24,101
Bye.

207
00:19:50,194 --> 00:19:54,063
- Do we really have to keep
watching this? - Yes.

208
00:19:54,065 --> 00:19:55,931
Dad.

209
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:57,766
Yes.

210
00:19:57,768 --> 00:19:59,201
Hey.
It makes him happy.

211
00:19:59,203 --> 00:20:02,904
Okay.
Let him be happy.

212
00:20:02,906 --> 00:20:04,306
Fine.

213
00:20:08,911 --> 00:20:11,947
- I'll go put my feet up
for a minute. - Okay.

214
00:20:11,949 --> 00:20:14,282
Oh, no. This is such
a good play though.

215
00:20:14,284 --> 00:20:16,351
Really? Right here?
Uh, no. In a few more.

216
00:20:16,353 --> 00:20:19,121
It's not really that good.
You should go.

217
00:20:24,526 --> 00:20:27,061
I thought
I'd find you in here.

218
00:20:27,063 --> 00:20:31,298
Whose picture was that?
Uh, just Facebook.

219
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,934
Yeah?

220
00:20:33,936 --> 00:20:36,771
Been on that phone
an awful lot, missy.

221
00:20:36,773 --> 00:20:38,205
Mm-hmm.

222
00:20:38,207 --> 00:20:40,908
You're not trying
to escape, are you?

223
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:44,411
'Cause I would like to escape
from these crazy people...

224
00:20:44,413 --> 00:20:46,413
that are my family.

225
00:20:46,415 --> 00:20:48,548
Oh, they're so sweet.

226
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:51,117
Well, they think you're great.
They're so glad you're here.

227
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:53,119
And I'm really glad
that you're here...

228
00:20:53,121 --> 00:20:55,488
and not alone.

229
00:20:55,490 --> 00:21:00,860
You're well-fed, and it's good to
spend the holiday with you.

230
00:21:00,862 --> 00:21:03,863
My family just loves you.

231
00:21:03,865 --> 00:21:05,465
Our house is your house.

232
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:16,341
Just sleeping in
a couple more minutes.

233
00:21:16,343 --> 00:21:19,578
It's just wonderful.
I know.

234
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:25,184
Hey, have you, uh... Have you seen
that photo that's going around school?

235
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,021
Apparently,
it's a topless photo...

236
00:21:29,023 --> 00:21:31,557
of a freshman girl.

237
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:34,193
God.

238
00:21:34,195 --> 00:21:37,062
I mean, a student's phone
was confiscated,

239
00:21:37,064 --> 00:21:39,897
and the new assistant
principal found it.

240
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:43,935
Oh.
What was she thinking?

241
00:21:43,937 --> 00:21:48,372
I mean, kids... They can do
things that are so stupid.

242
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:53,611
I mean,
that's really dumb.

243
00:21:53,613 --> 00:21:56,047
Yeah.
Phones are everywhere.

244
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:59,250
<i>Everybody will send
that to everyone.</i>

245
00:21:59,252 --> 00:22:01,886
It was a freshman?
Yeah. Yeah, she's a freshman.

246
00:22:01,888 --> 00:22:04,154
I don't have her,
but, um,

247
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:07,257
I think Irene
has her.

248
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:09,159
So.

249
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,560
But...

250
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:15,131
I hope her parents don't see that.
That would just be...

251
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:17,601
That'd be so sad.

252
00:22:20,137 --> 00:22:22,639
Oh, my gosh. By the way,
I totally forgot.

253
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:25,008
I meant to
ask you sooner.

254
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,477
Is there any way you can help me
chaperone the Sadie Hawkins Day dance?

255
00:22:28,479 --> 00:22:30,880
Please?

256
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:32,915
I need, like,
three more people.

257
00:22:34,551 --> 00:22:37,019
Oh.

258
00:22:37,021 --> 00:22:39,488
Really.
It could be fun.

259
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:42,258
I've managed to get out of doing that
the whole time I've been here.

260
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,193
Please, come on.
Oh.

261
00:22:44,195 --> 00:22:47,129
Um... Who else
is chaperoning?

262
00:22:47,131 --> 00:22:49,465
Um, Tony...

263
00:22:49,467 --> 00:22:53,102
and, uh...
now, Irene...

264
00:22:53,104 --> 00:22:55,069
She never got back
to me on it.

265
00:22:55,071 --> 00:22:57,438
Oh, gosh.
I really need your help.

266
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,908
I need to get, like,
three more people.

267
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:03,611
Yeah, I'll do it. Yeah, it's fine.
I'll do it. You owe me, but...

268
00:23:03,613 --> 00:23:06,614
I'm there. Okay. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

269
00:23:06,616 --> 00:23:08,349
Mm-hmm. That'll be great.
It'll be fun.

270
00:23:08,351 --> 00:23:09,951
Mm-hmm.
Yeah. It will.

271
00:23:09,953 --> 00:23:11,352
Mm-hmm.

272
00:23:31,472 --> 00:23:33,073
Hey.

273
00:23:34,509 --> 00:23:37,577
I need you to delete
that photo from your phone.

274
00:23:37,579 --> 00:23:39,379
Okay.

275
00:23:39,381 --> 00:23:41,315
No, I need you to do it now.

276
00:23:50,657 --> 00:23:52,959
Done.
Thanks.

277
00:23:54,728 --> 00:23:56,629
Is it about that girl?

278
00:23:58,165 --> 00:24:00,333
Yeah. It just made me
really nervous.

279
00:24:03,737 --> 00:24:05,638
You have a good
Thanksgiving?

280
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,240
Yeah. It was good.

281
00:24:08,242 --> 00:24:09,742
You?

282
00:24:09,744 --> 00:24:11,643
It was all right.

283
00:24:14,246 --> 00:24:17,248
Can I, uh...
Can I come see you tonight?

284
00:24:19,318 --> 00:24:21,686
Yeah.

285
00:24:21,688 --> 00:24:24,622
My roommate's out of town still,
so just come on over.

286
00:24:25,691 --> 00:24:27,258
All right.

287
00:24:30,296 --> 00:24:32,097
What's up, man?
Yo, what's up, bro?

288
00:24:32,099 --> 00:24:33,999
How you doin'?
Good. What about you?

289
00:24:34,001 --> 00:24:36,533
Good, man.
You boys stay out of trouble, all right?

290
00:24:36,535 --> 00:24:38,402
You hungry?
Yeah, dude.

291
00:24:38,404 --> 00:24:40,270
Let's grill.
Let's roll.

292
00:24:56,588 --> 00:24:58,722
...the police department
now wants the city...

293
00:25:02,227 --> 00:25:05,728
So, I got pulled in to chaperoning
the Sadie Hawkins dance.

294
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:07,196
Oh, yeah?

295
00:25:08,699 --> 00:25:13,036
This girl actually asked
me to the dance today.

296
00:25:14,171 --> 00:25:15,605
Really?
Mm-hmm.

297
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:26,715
Yeah?
Yeah?

298
00:25:28,051 --> 00:25:29,484
Figured, uh,

299
00:25:31,421 --> 00:25:35,390
I should go, you know, just so people
don't get suspicious or anything.

300
00:25:41,431 --> 00:25:43,398
Yes?

301
00:25:44,734 --> 00:25:47,702
So, I have to watch you dance
with some girl?

302
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:50,739
Mmm. Are you jealous?

303
00:25:56,511 --> 00:25:58,446
I kind of like it.

304
00:26:01,483 --> 00:26:04,151
Does that mean
that you're going with her?

305
00:26:04,153 --> 00:26:05,753
Yeah.
Really?

306
00:26:05,755 --> 00:26:09,123
Yeah. Don't worry.
It doesn't mean anything.

307
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:10,825
Just goin' with her.

308
00:26:19,133 --> 00:26:22,735
The regular deadline for U.T.
applications are coming up.

309
00:26:22,737 --> 00:26:25,872
Has everyone gotten their waivers
who is planning on getting a waiver?

310
00:26:25,874 --> 00:26:28,241
Does anyone need
any help with that?

311
00:26:28,243 --> 00:26:29,843
Good? We all good?
Good to go.

312
00:26:29,845 --> 00:26:33,279
There's also A.P.'s.

313
00:26:33,281 --> 00:26:36,449
You want to start thinking about which
A.P.'s you're gonna wanna take, which exams.

314
00:26:36,451 --> 00:26:38,551
You're gonna wanna sign up for that.
How long is the exam?

315
00:26:38,553 --> 00:26:40,753
How long is each exam?
The exam.

316
00:26:40,755 --> 00:26:42,489
Um...
I think it's three hours.

317
00:26:42,491 --> 00:26:44,490
Okay.

318
00:26:44,492 --> 00:26:47,226
Just don't take it.
My sister said it was like two...

319
00:26:47,228 --> 00:26:50,162
All right. What else?
Um, do we have any announcements?

320
00:26:50,164 --> 00:26:52,197
Student relations?

321
00:26:52,199 --> 00:26:54,533
Um, if anybody wants to
help clean up after the dance...

322
00:26:56,837 --> 00:26:58,670
Forget it, Lanie.

323
00:26:58,672 --> 00:27:01,140
Lanie, no one's gonna
clean up after the dance.

324
00:27:01,142 --> 00:27:03,175
We love you, Lanie.
Is everyone going to the dance?

325
00:27:03,177 --> 00:27:04,676
- No.
- Oh, yeah.

326
00:27:04,678 --> 00:27:07,479
Are you chaperoning?
Um, I do not know.

327
00:27:07,481 --> 00:27:10,181
You should.

328
00:27:10,183 --> 00:27:12,483
We shall see. s that freshman
gonna be there?

329
00:27:17,689 --> 00:27:19,824
Lanie, are you gonna
invite me to the dance?

330
00:27:19,826 --> 00:27:22,660
In your dreams.

331
00:27:22,662 --> 00:27:25,196
I asked that freshman.
I'm going with that freshman.

332
00:27:25,198 --> 00:27:27,932
No. You asked her too?
You can't really say no to those.

333
00:28:07,504 --> 00:28:10,272
<i>Hello?
Hey, baby.</i>

334
00:28:10,274 --> 00:28:12,741
<i>I was just thinking about you.
Okay.</i>

335
00:28:12,743 --> 00:28:14,743
<i>Yeah.</i>

336
00:28:14,745 --> 00:28:16,512
<i>Can I come over?</i>

337
00:28:16,514 --> 00:28:18,981
Oh. She's home.

338
00:28:18,983 --> 00:28:21,884
<i>What about later?
We can go to my brother's.</i>

339
00:28:21,886 --> 00:28:23,852
What time?

340
00:28:23,854 --> 00:28:27,322
<i>9:00?
Okay.</i>

341
00:28:27,324 --> 00:28:28,756
Bye.

342
00:28:58,386 --> 00:28:59,786
Ha-ha!

343
00:29:07,362 --> 00:29:09,730
Are you sure this is okay?
Totally.

344
00:29:09,732 --> 00:29:12,733
Greg said he'd be gone
all weekend.

345
00:29:12,735 --> 00:29:15,335
Greg's your only brother,
right?

346
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:18,337
No. There's, uh, Doug,
who lives in L.A.

347
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:25,878
Some water?

348
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,747
No, thanks.

349
00:29:27,749 --> 00:29:29,682
How old is Greg?

350
00:29:31,718 --> 00:29:33,653
Like 26, I think.

351
00:29:58,044 --> 00:29:59,978
Take your clothes off.

352
00:30:45,522 --> 00:30:46,923
Come here.

353
00:31:29,831 --> 00:31:32,633
It's pretty rainy.
I know.

354
00:31:32,635 --> 00:31:35,936
- You think it's gonna be raining
at the ranch? - Nah.

355
00:31:35,938 --> 00:31:39,006
Still got a long ways to go,
and it's moving out.

356
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:41,475
It'll be good.

357
00:31:41,477 --> 00:31:43,911
Mmm.

358
00:31:43,913 --> 00:31:46,614
I've never been
to a ranch before.

359
00:31:46,616 --> 00:31:48,948
Really? We don't have them
on the East Coast.

360
00:31:50,017 --> 00:31:52,585
Right.

361
00:31:52,587 --> 00:31:54,587
How long have you
been in Texas?

362
00:31:54,589 --> 00:31:55,955
Four years.

363
00:31:57,725 --> 00:31:59,759
You've never been
to a ranch?

364
00:31:59,761 --> 00:32:01,728
No one I know has one.

365
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:03,763
Wow.

366
00:32:03,765 --> 00:32:05,965
Lucky for you, I do.

367
00:32:10,171 --> 00:32:11,771
Hmm!
Hey.

368
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:24,016
I think we should
just keep driving...

369
00:32:24,018 --> 00:32:26,018
just stay out here forever,
never go back.

370
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,587
Huh. You're crazy.

371
00:32:30,023 --> 00:32:32,724
Put some music on.

372
00:32:49,975 --> 00:32:52,877
Can I ask you something?
Sure.

373
00:32:52,879 --> 00:32:54,579
What do you think?

374
00:32:54,581 --> 00:32:57,114
Do you think
it's gettin' bigger?

375
00:32:57,116 --> 00:32:59,684
I think
it's gettin' bigger.

376
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:02,053
I mean,
I don't know about you,

377
00:33:02,055 --> 00:33:04,689
but I mean,
what do you think?

378
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:07,791
I mean, it's stronger,
you know?

379
00:33:07,793 --> 00:33:10,794
I think it's kind of...
It's coming into its own, you know?

380
00:33:10,796 --> 00:33:12,662
It's bulkin' up.

381
00:33:12,664 --> 00:33:15,732
It's got...
It's got some extra...

382
00:33:15,734 --> 00:33:18,168
Okay. Watch the road.

383
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:21,137
Powerin' up a little bit.

384
00:33:26,777 --> 00:33:28,178
Come on.

385
00:33:30,248 --> 00:33:32,147
You know you want to.

386
00:33:54,104 --> 00:33:59,927
# We're walking forward

387
00:34:00,726 --> 00:34:03,318
# Forever

388
00:34:08,292 --> 00:34:14,040
# Breaking the rules

389
00:34:22,747 --> 00:34:27,490
# Finally feels

390
00:34:29,093 --> 00:34:31,714
# The capture

391
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:40,707
# Baby

392
00:37:18,801 --> 00:37:21,735
You scared me.

393
00:37:23,204 --> 00:37:24,804
Sorry.

394
00:37:26,407 --> 00:37:28,007
Mmm.

395
00:37:30,244 --> 00:37:32,078
Morning.
Morning.

396
00:37:33,781 --> 00:37:35,515
Take this off.

397
00:37:35,517 --> 00:37:37,083
It's scratchy.

398
00:37:38,219 --> 00:37:39,953
Okay.

399
00:37:39,955 --> 00:37:41,988
How was your walk?
It was great.

400
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:44,224
Here.
I made some coffee.

401
00:37:44,226 --> 00:37:45,958
You did?
Mm-hmm.

402
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,193
Gonna make you breakfast.
What are you makin'?

403
00:37:48,195 --> 00:37:50,829
Best breakfast you've ever had.
What's it gonna be?

404
00:37:50,831 --> 00:37:53,398
Uh, I was thinking
maybe I would make some eggs.

405
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,501
Eggs?
Yeah.

406
00:37:55,503 --> 00:37:58,203
Hmm. And?
And, um...

407
00:37:59,439 --> 00:38:02,307
Just eggs.
Okay, sounds great.

408
00:38:06,179 --> 00:38:08,847
So, I think I'm gonna go
do that now.

409
00:38:08,849 --> 00:38:10,382
Mmm. Okay,
I'll see you later.

410
00:38:10,384 --> 00:38:14,852
Ah, fudge.

411
00:38:50,155 --> 00:38:51,388
Hello!

412
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:01,231
Shh. Shh!

413
00:39:01,233 --> 00:39:02,898
Hello. I heard something.
Someone's here.

414
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:05,401
What?
Someone's here!

415
00:39:05,403 --> 00:39:07,870
Get your clothes on.
Someone's here. Shit.

416
00:39:12,409 --> 00:39:15,444
Hello?
Oh, hey, James.

417
00:39:15,446 --> 00:39:17,179
I didn't know who that was.

418
00:39:17,181 --> 00:39:20,549
I was just out making my rounds.
I saw a car in the driveway.

419
00:39:20,551 --> 00:39:23,185
I didn't know you were comin' up here.
Yes, sir.

420
00:39:23,187 --> 00:39:25,154
Sorry.
I should have called you.

421
00:39:25,156 --> 00:39:27,488
You know, kind of came down.
Last minute thing.

422
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,424
Okay.

423
00:39:29,426 --> 00:39:32,193
Well, I'm off.
All right.

424
00:39:32,195 --> 00:39:33,995
Your father knows you're up here,
right, son?

425
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:36,030
Yes, sir.
Okay.

426
00:39:36,032 --> 00:39:38,933
Well, you give me a call
if you need anything.

427
00:39:38,935 --> 00:39:40,401
Okay, I will.

428
00:39:40,403 --> 00:39:42,003
Thanks.

429
00:39:55,216 --> 00:39:57,284
Hey. He's gone.

430
00:40:05,593 --> 00:40:07,661
Eric?

431
00:40:07,663 --> 00:40:09,296
Yes?

432
00:40:11,966 --> 00:40:14,501
Who was that?
James.

433
00:40:14,503 --> 00:40:17,104
Ranch foreman.

434
00:40:17,106 --> 00:40:19,338
I don't know what that means.

435
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:22,475
It's like a, uh,
property manager.

436
00:40:32,686 --> 00:40:34,287
You hungry?

437
00:40:45,197 --> 00:40:48,199
Um, is he gonna tell
your father that you're here?

438
00:40:49,602 --> 00:40:51,970
No. I doubt it.

439
00:40:51,972 --> 00:40:53,505
You doubt it?

440
00:40:55,207 --> 00:40:57,142
It's fine. Okay?

441
00:40:58,277 --> 00:41:00,345
James is cool.
He doesn't give a fuck.

442
00:41:07,486 --> 00:41:09,086
Hey.

443
00:41:11,289 --> 00:41:12,690
What?

444
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,594
You have no idea how terrible this would
be for me if we were found out, do you?

445
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,965
Yes, I do.

446
00:41:23,501 --> 00:41:25,502
But it's fine. I mean...

447
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:28,005
I would lose my job.
Okay. I know.

448
00:41:28,007 --> 00:41:31,175
Shit. Chill out.

449
00:41:31,177 --> 00:41:34,211
What if that man tells your father?
He's not going to.

450
00:41:37,114 --> 00:41:38,481
Look, I told you...

451
00:41:41,118 --> 00:41:44,320
I know James, all right?
He's fine.

452
00:41:44,322 --> 00:41:47,123
He's caught me down here
doing plenty of shit, okay?

453
00:41:47,125 --> 00:41:49,425
He doesn't care.
He's not gonna tell anyone.

454
00:41:49,427 --> 00:41:52,128
And even if he does, like,
what... what is he gonna say?

455
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:55,264
Oh, Eric was out here
by hisself sleepin'?

456
00:41:55,266 --> 00:41:59,135
I mean... Okay.
So what?

457
00:42:09,278 --> 00:42:11,546
Are you not gonna eat?

458
00:42:22,525 --> 00:42:26,260
Like, seriously, babe?

459
00:42:26,262 --> 00:42:28,162
Don't worry about it,
all right?

460
00:42:29,164 --> 00:42:31,165
We're fine.

461
00:42:40,042 --> 00:42:43,611
After this weekend, I think we should
just put things on hold for a bit.

462
00:42:46,114 --> 00:42:47,715
Why?

463
00:43:24,818 --> 00:43:27,386
What you doin' out here?

464
00:43:27,388 --> 00:43:28,821
Reading.

465
00:43:28,823 --> 00:43:30,456
Hmm.

466
00:43:41,267 --> 00:43:42,700
What are you thinking?
Hmm.

467
00:43:42,702 --> 00:43:44,335
What are you doing?

468
00:43:46,539 --> 00:43:49,674
I thought we weren't supposed to
end things until this weekend...

469
00:43:49,676 --> 00:43:51,676
was over.

470
00:43:53,245 --> 00:43:55,613
I don't want to do this right now.
I do.

471
00:44:03,355 --> 00:44:05,256
What is the matter
with you?

472
00:46:55,287 --> 00:46:56,787
Attention, French students.

473
00:46:56,789 --> 00:47:00,357
If you are participating in
the National French Contest...

474
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:03,927
and are interested in practicing,
please see Madame Simone...

475
00:47:06,664 --> 00:47:09,465
And now, time for sports.

476
00:47:09,467 --> 00:47:12,802
This weekend, J.V. football
team, Marble Falls, 14-0.

477
00:47:13,128 --> 00:47:17,801
Girls soccer team, Lake Travis. Lindsay
Cassidy made three goals and two assists.

478
00:47:18,843 --> 00:47:22,011
Uh, boys soccer has a game
this Friday at home.

479
00:47:22,013 --> 00:47:25,381
And the girls play away
at Vanderbilt.

480
00:47:25,383 --> 00:47:29,619
Come out and support the Lady Wolverines
as they take on the Vipers.

481
00:47:29,621 --> 00:47:32,721
We... We have about 20 minutes
to ask for anything.

482
00:47:32,723 --> 00:47:35,757
We have great topics.
What's new...

483
00:47:35,759 --> 00:47:37,392
Oh!

484
00:47:37,394 --> 00:47:39,361
Ooh.

485
00:47:41,398 --> 00:47:43,732
Mmm. You have any beer?
Yeah!

486
00:47:43,734 --> 00:47:48,770
Yes. Hell, yes. Oh, uh, Matt, this is
Diana. Diana, Matt.

487
00:47:48,772 --> 00:47:50,439
Hi, Diana.
Hi.

488
00:47:50,441 --> 00:47:52,874
Um...

489
00:47:56,745 --> 00:47:59,513
Ah. Perfect.

490
00:47:59,515 --> 00:48:01,549
Oh, do you have a...
Do you have a bottle opener?

491
00:48:01,551 --> 00:48:03,818
Yes.

492
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:06,654
Actually...
Actually... Actually,

493
00:48:06,656 --> 00:48:09,357
I think
they're twist tops.

494
00:48:10,793 --> 00:48:14,962
Not even worth it.
Well. Yeah, that's good.

495
00:48:14,964 --> 00:48:19,433
Diana, do you want a beer?
No, it's okay.

496
00:48:19,435 --> 00:48:22,435
You sure, honey?
Yeah, I think I'm gonna go to sleep.

497
00:48:22,437 --> 00:48:24,637
Aw. Okay.

498
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:26,606
Good night.

499
00:48:26,608 --> 00:48:28,141
Night.

500
00:48:28,143 --> 00:48:29,843
Come here.

501
00:48:46,894 --> 00:48:49,561
# Cling like I'm one with you

502
00:48:53,433 --> 00:48:56,702
# There's something more
when you're around #

503
00:48:57,771 --> 00:48:59,872
Hey!
Hey!

504
00:48:59,874 --> 00:49:02,941
Isn't this great?
Yeah, it's fantastic.

505
00:49:02,943 --> 00:49:05,978
Oh, my God.
Look at them.

506
00:49:08,515 --> 00:49:12,017
# Come back to me
when you're found #

507
00:52:27,872 --> 00:52:30,374
Can you come by and see me
sometime today after class?

508
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:36,046
End of lunch?

509
00:52:38,148 --> 00:52:39,816
Okay.

510
00:52:41,251 --> 00:52:42,852
Thanks.

511
00:52:59,337 --> 00:53:01,170
Hey!
Mmm, hey.

512
00:53:01,172 --> 00:53:04,139
Oh, gosh, you're already done.
Yeah. I got so much to do today.

513
00:53:04,141 --> 00:53:06,074
You know how it is.
Okay.

514
00:53:06,076 --> 00:53:07,809
See you later.
All right. I'll see ya later.

515
00:53:11,014 --> 00:53:13,982
Come in.

516
00:53:19,122 --> 00:53:21,023
Hey.

517
00:53:42,911 --> 00:53:44,378
What's up?

518
00:53:46,148 --> 00:53:47,715
I miss you.

519
00:53:49,751 --> 00:53:51,819
I don't know
what I was thinking.

520
00:54:01,729 --> 00:54:03,463
You wanna
come over tonight?

521
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:06,933
Okay.

522
00:54:08,335 --> 00:54:10,303
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were in a meeting.

523
00:54:10,305 --> 00:54:11,905
Yeah, well, knock first.

524
00:54:11,907 --> 00:54:13,339
I'm gonna go.
Yeah, I was...

525
00:54:13,341 --> 00:54:15,275
No! It's fine.
Did you want something?

526
00:54:15,277 --> 00:54:18,344
Um... No, not important.
