00:00:12,292 --> 00:00:13,458
( grunts )

2
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:51,625
( sighs )

3
00:00:55,417 --> 00:00:56,375
Hmm.

4
00:01:02,542 --> 00:01:03,500
( kisses )

5
00:01:04,542 --> 00:01:05,500
( sneezes )

6
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:09,792
<i>( knock at door )</i>

7
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:12,167
Elaine! ( speaking Spanish )

8
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,625
I gotta get to my game.

9
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:17,167
That's disgusting!

10
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,208
So is your face. ( chuckles )

11
00:01:20,292 --> 00:01:23,125
I'm gonna tell Mom!

12
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,333
( scoffs )
Grow up, tattletale.

13
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,333
Ugh!

14
00:01:28,417 --> 00:01:31,583
- Mami!
- Carmen:<i> Ready? Here it goes.</i>

15
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:34,708
-<i> The ring doesn't lie.</i>
Shh, shh, shh.
- Mami.

16
00:01:34,792 --> 00:01:39,333
Girl, girl, I knew you
were gonna have a girl.

17
00:01:39,417 --> 00:01:41,333
( laughs )
Ay, that's just superstition.

18
00:01:41,417 --> 00:01:43,250
Oh, yeah? How about when
Elcie was having twins

19
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:44,750
and not even the doctor knew,

20
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:46,458
'cause the girl was hiding
behind the boy

21
00:01:46,542 --> 00:01:49,083
and the ring kept changing
its swing from boy to girl?

22
00:01:49,167 --> 00:01:51,458
Yeah, but you said that meant
the kid was gonna be gay.

23
00:01:51,542 --> 00:01:52,458
My bad.

24
00:01:52,542 --> 00:01:53,625
( both laugh )

25
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:54,958
If you're lucky,

26
00:01:55,042 --> 00:01:56,625
she'll have green eyes
like Diego.

27
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:59,125
You can start calling him
Uncle Diego now.

28
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:01,500
Elaine, why aren't you wearing
your bathing suit yet?

29
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:03,917
Mom, I told you,
I don't wanna go.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,500
Because you got your period?

31
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:08,792
Come on, we haven't been
to the beach all summer.

32
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:11,500
Why don't you just wear
one of the bathing suits
Titi Lizzy gave you, huh?

33
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:15,000
Like the burgundy one.
That way if you drip,
nobody could tell.

34
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:17,542
Trick of the trade.
Plus it's sexy.

35
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,708
She don't gotta be sexy.
She's only ten.

36
00:02:19,792 --> 00:02:22,083
She's a señorita now.
You better get used to it.

37
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:25,583
You talk to me about sexy
when you have a girl.

38
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:27,958
I knew you were having a girl.

39
00:02:28,042 --> 00:02:31,042
You know,
girls make your nose spread.

40
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:33,375
Mm-hmm.

41
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,708
Wah!

42
00:02:35,792 --> 00:02:38,958
( all laugh )

43
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,708
<i>( birds squawking )</i>

44
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,542
( indistinct chatter )

45
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:20,000
Elaine. Elaine. Come on.

46
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:23,000
Let's go to the water. Come on.

47
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:24,667
Come on. Come on.

48
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,500
No, I'm OK here.

49
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,875
Lizzy:
<i>It's OK, you don't have</i>
<i>to take off your shorts.</i>

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,875
- Why?
-<i> She doesn't want to</i>
<i>'cause she has her period.</i>

51
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:33,000
Titi Lizzy!

52
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:34,292
Come on, Lizzy.

53
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:36,792
Ay, please.
She'll get over it.

54
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,708
Hey.

55
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:49,625
Last one in the water
is a rotten egg.

56
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,000
What do you think, huh?

57
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,583
Come on.
Just up to your knees.

58
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:53,583
Come on, Elaine.

59
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:57,458
<i>Come on. Let's go.</i>

60
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,208
Uh, I have to pee.

61
00:04:03,292 --> 00:04:04,583
- Again?
- OK.

62
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:07,083
I'm pregnant.
One day you'll get it.

63
00:04:07,167 --> 00:04:09,250
Toma Elaine, take this.
I'll go, too.

64
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,667
OK, we'll get the car.
Come on.

65
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:35,292
Elaine. Elaine.

66
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,375
Come here. Come on.

67
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:43,917
Hey. You didn't have
to be embarrassed
because you're bleeding now.

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,958
That's just a part
of being a woman.

69
00:04:48,167 --> 00:04:49,792
Look. You see?

70
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:53,375
It's natural. It's normal.

71
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:54,833
You see?

72
00:04:56,958 --> 00:05:00,042
It's normal.

73
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,250
Hmm?

74
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,667
I'm gonna go look for them.

75
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,708
Carmen:
<i>Elaine, is that you?</i>

76
00:06:25,792 --> 00:06:27,292
Yeah.

77
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,583
Carmen:
<i>Come back here.</i>
<i>I have a surprise for you.</i>

78
00:06:32,042 --> 00:06:34,500
( baby cooing )

79
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:39,000
- Carmen:<i> Oh, she's so cute.</i>
- Lizzy:<i> She's beautiful.</i>

80
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,917
Well, don't you want
to come meet your new cousin?

81
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,417
Come say hi
to Baby Alissa.

82
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,667
She's precious.

83
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:00,292
( cooing )

84
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:12,000
- She's so cute.
- I know.

85
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,167
Shh.

86
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,583
Titi Lizzy...

87
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:40,292
I have to tell you something.

88
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,333
