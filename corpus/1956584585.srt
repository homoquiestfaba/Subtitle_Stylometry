00:00:53,227 --> 00:00:54,315
[beeps]

00:00:57,492 --> 00:00:58,623
[beeps]

3
00:01:02,584 --> 00:01:03,846
[beeps]

00:01:03,889 --> 00:01:05,369
[mechanical hiss]

5
00:01:19,818 --> 00:01:20,950
Gentlemen.

6
00:01:22,734 --> 00:01:25,433
Our treasure is untouched.

7
00:01:29,306 --> 00:01:35,138
The most expensive,
privately owned collection
of rare coins

8
00:01:35,182 --> 00:01:36,792
is still ours.

9
00:01:36,835 --> 00:01:40,491
Rossini Enterprises
has based its business

10
00:01:40,535 --> 00:01:42,102
on this collateral that

11
00:01:42,145 --> 00:01:46,497
has allowed us to become
as rich as we are today.

12
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:50,240
There is no Wall Street collapse
or economic crisis

13
00:01:50,284 --> 00:01:53,417
that will ever
undermine its value.

14
00:02:46,035 --> 00:02:47,167
We're running out of time.

15
00:02:49,343 --> 00:02:51,388
We're always ready. Copy.

16
00:03:30,471 --> 00:03:32,299
I have everything you need.

17
00:03:34,605 --> 00:03:37,565
I hope so.
You already confirmed delivery.

18
00:03:38,435 --> 00:03:39,784
They're all inside.

19
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:39,279
You can count them
if you want.

20
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:43,674
No problem.

21
00:04:47,678 --> 00:04:48,766
I trust you.

22
00:05:53,048 --> 00:05:54,658
[shouts]

23
00:05:54,702 --> 00:05:56,356
[grunting]

24
00:06:30,477 --> 00:06:31,608
Quit!

25
00:06:40,965 --> 00:06:42,706
[straining]

26
00:06:47,624 --> 00:06:48,582

27
00:07:06,382 --> 00:07:09,080
[panting]

28
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,694
[man shouts]

29
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,149
[Russian man] Drop it.

30
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:39,241
I said, drop it.

31
00:07:43,027 --> 00:07:46,683
This is why
I always carry two.

32
00:07:46,727 --> 00:07:47,858
Now walk.

33
00:07:49,643 --> 00:07:50,992
Walk.

34
00:07:51,035 --> 00:07:52,297
Walk.

35
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:55,736
Stop.

36
00:07:56,867 --> 00:07:59,479
Drop the guns
or I kill him!

37
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:04,396
I said,
drop the guns or I kill him!

38
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,791
[in Italian]

39
00:08:10,011 --> 00:08:11,316
[Russian man in English]
Walk back.

40
00:08:14,232 --> 00:08:15,364
Walk.

41
00:08:23,677 --> 00:08:24,808
You drive.

42
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:13,683
[grunts]

43
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,816
[breathing heavily]

44
00:09:19,341 --> 00:09:20,472
Thanks.

45
00:09:20,516 --> 00:09:21,561
You're welcome.

46
00:09:41,972 --> 00:09:43,060
Drop the weapon.

47
00:09:45,933 --> 00:09:47,108
Interpol.

48
00:09:48,936 --> 00:09:50,590
Can I show you
my badge?

49
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:51,765
[officer] Where is it?

50
00:09:51,808 --> 00:09:53,244
Back pocket.

51
00:10:00,556 --> 00:10:02,297
Are you gonna stay there
for a while?

52
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,778
-Okay. There.
-[woman] Can I relax now?

53
00:10:04,821 --> 00:10:05,953
Yeah.

54
00:10:17,878 --> 00:10:19,706
You just screwed up
a joint operation

55
00:10:19,749 --> 00:10:23,100
to capture
an international network
of arms dealers.

56
00:10:23,144 --> 00:10:26,277
The screw-up comes
from your office.
We haven't been briefed.

57
00:10:28,192 --> 00:10:29,541
Are we free to go?

58
00:10:31,021 --> 00:10:32,675
[captain whistles][man] Are we free to go?

59
00:10:33,763 --> 00:10:35,112
[in Italian]

60
00:10:43,207 --> 00:10:44,426
[clears throat]

61
00:10:44,469 --> 00:10:45,601
[in English] Let me.

62
00:10:47,908 --> 00:10:49,561
May I?Yeah.

63
00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:55,829
Well, they're not gonna
be selling any more guns.

64
00:10:55,872 --> 00:10:57,787
We'll never get
to their supplier.

65
00:11:00,268 --> 00:11:02,444
What about the clients
who bought the gun stuff?

66
00:11:04,011 --> 00:11:05,926
We should debrief
before you go.

67
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,148
I'll write my report
tomorrow.

68
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:13,542
I've got a marriage to save.

69
00:11:15,239 --> 00:11:17,024
[sighs] And...

70
00:11:17,067 --> 00:11:19,896
And?My daughter's gonna
be there.

71
00:11:21,245 --> 00:11:23,204
I didn't know
you had a daughter.

72
00:11:23,247 --> 00:11:25,946
Yeah. I haven't seen her
for quite some time now.

73
00:11:28,644 --> 00:11:29,776
Quite some time.

74
00:11:39,786 --> 00:11:41,613
All right.

75
00:11:41,657 --> 00:11:43,528
Uh, how do I look?[laughs]

76
00:11:44,486 --> 00:11:45,792
Handsome.

77
00:11:47,445 --> 00:11:49,273
Well, good luck
with your wife.

78
00:11:50,187 --> 00:11:51,232
And your daughter.

79
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,830
[indistinct chatter]

80
00:12:41,195 --> 00:12:43,327
Do you always go
to parties like this?

81
00:12:43,371 --> 00:12:45,199
Once in a while.

82
00:12:45,242 --> 00:12:46,766
Part of my business.

83
00:12:49,377 --> 00:12:50,508
Fell two floors.

84
00:12:50,552 --> 00:12:52,380
[women chuckle]

85
00:12:52,423 --> 00:12:53,598
Beg your pardon.

86
00:12:59,474 --> 00:13:01,955
He's cute.Can't argue with that.

87
00:13:05,219 --> 00:13:07,047
Mary.

88
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,832
You look lovely as always.

89
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:11,312
Who's your friend?

90
00:13:11,355 --> 00:13:14,576
Diana,
my husband's daughter.

91
00:13:14,619 --> 00:13:17,971
And Gabriele.
Gabriele Damiani.

92
00:13:18,014 --> 00:13:20,103
So nice to make
your acquaintance.

93
00:13:21,713 --> 00:13:24,673
Is Michael
joining us tonight?Maybe.

94
00:13:24,716 --> 00:13:27,284
Yeah, right.
He's working as usual.

95
00:13:27,328 --> 00:13:30,984
I haven't seen my father
in four years, and he still
can't make it in time.

96
00:13:31,027 --> 00:13:32,463
Diana.

97
00:13:32,507 --> 00:13:34,378
Well, I will see you later.

98
00:13:41,951 --> 00:13:44,780
I've been told that Gabriele
has been hovering around.

99
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:48,697
If that's hovering,
I'm terrified what
a full-scale attack would be.

100
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,961
Handsome, wealthy, single.
What's the problem?

101
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,008
I'm married.

102
00:13:55,051 --> 00:13:57,097
You're separated.

103
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:00,230
Meaning, go check if the grass
is greener on the other side.

104
00:14:02,058 --> 00:14:04,321
You and Michael got married
way too young.

105
00:14:04,365 --> 00:14:07,498
-Enjoy this while you can.
-[phone rings]

106
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:10,153
Ah. Speak of the devil.

107
00:14:10,197 --> 00:14:12,286
What excuse will it be
this time?

108
00:14:13,591 --> 00:14:14,766
Hi, Michael.

109
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,595
Yeah. Diana's here.

110
00:14:19,597 --> 00:14:22,557
-Do you think security
can let him in?
-Do I have to?

111
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,775
Sara.

112
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,128
Okay. Yeah,
she's right on it.

113
00:14:28,171 --> 00:14:30,652
See you soon. Bye.

114
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:44,013
Mary. Hi.

115
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:48,757
Wow, you look great.

116
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,846
And you look
pretty good yourself.

117
00:14:51,978 --> 00:14:53,849
So... [clears throat]

118
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,720
So where's-- where's Diana?

119
00:14:58,506 --> 00:14:59,811
Hi, Diana.

120
00:15:04,381 --> 00:15:06,470
Oh. Hmm...

121
00:15:08,516 --> 00:15:11,998
Wow, you're--Dad, I missed you so much.

122
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,609
Yeah, I missed you too.

123
00:15:14,652 --> 00:15:18,395
It's silly of me.It's not silly.

124
00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:21,790
It's not silly missing your dad.
It's all right. Don't worry.

125
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,923
[Diana]
I just wish we could
see each other more.

126
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:25,446
Yeah, me too. Me too.

127
00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:29,406
Hey, sorry I was late.
I got held up at work.

128
00:15:31,582 --> 00:15:34,194
Look at you. [chuckles]

129
00:15:34,237 --> 00:15:37,327
Wow, you look beautiful.
What happened? You grew up.
You got so big.

130
00:15:37,371 --> 00:15:40,243
Let me see. My pet.

131
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:43,159
Come here. Come here.No one's called me pet
in a long time.

132
00:15:43,203 --> 00:15:45,596
Yes. You're gonna be
my little girl.Shall we?

133
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,425
Okay, let's go.
Let's check it out. Come on.

134
00:15:49,731 --> 00:15:51,298
Ladies and gentlemen,

135
00:15:51,341 --> 00:15:53,387
if I can have a moment
of your attention.

136
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,393
After two years of strong sales,
continued expansion...

137
00:15:59,436 --> 00:16:02,962
Wait. How old are you now?
What are you, 12? No, 24?

138
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:05,616
She's 29.[chuckles]

139
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:09,969
[Rossini] I can safely say
that we have emerged
out of the crisis.

140
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:14,103
[guests applauding]

141
00:16:15,061 --> 00:16:16,888
Thank you.

142
00:16:16,932 --> 00:16:21,502
Rossini Industries
is investing heavily
in new technologies

143
00:16:21,545 --> 00:16:24,418
to stay well ahead
of these important trends.

144
00:16:27,334 --> 00:16:29,640
Please, sir.Sorry.

145
00:16:29,684 --> 00:16:31,686
Madam.[Michael]
I'm sorry. Excuse us.

146
00:16:31,729 --> 00:16:32,948
Sorry.

147
00:16:35,124 --> 00:16:38,693
Like every one of us,
I like to see...

148
00:16:39,868 --> 00:16:42,827
some profits
of our enterprises.

149
00:16:42,871 --> 00:16:44,699
But on one condition:

150
00:16:44,742 --> 00:16:46,918
respecting the world we live in.

151
00:16:48,094 --> 00:16:50,531
Respect for the environment,

152
00:16:50,574 --> 00:16:53,838
the people, plants,
and animals that live
on this beautiful planet.

153
00:16:55,753 --> 00:17:00,671
This is a major concern of mine
and of our enterprises.

154
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,605
[in Italian]

155
00:17:21,649 --> 00:17:22,737

[muffled gunshots]

157
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:08,277
[in English] Come in.

158

[grunting]

159
00:20:06,901 --> 00:20:08,729
Let's go. Come on, come on.

160
00:20:12,341 --> 00:20:14,996
-[gunmen shout]
-[guests scream]

161
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,040
What's going on?

162
00:20:27,878 --> 00:20:29,532
Sit down!

163
00:20:29,576 --> 00:20:32,579
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

164
00:20:32,622 --> 00:20:36,147
My apologies
for the interruption.

165
00:20:36,191 --> 00:20:40,282
My men and I are going
to be here for a few hours.

166
00:20:40,326 --> 00:20:43,503
We expect your full cooperation.

167
00:20:43,546 --> 00:20:44,895
What do you want?

168
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,768
You, come here.

169
00:20:48,421 --> 00:20:49,509
[Sara] Me?

170
00:20:49,552 --> 00:20:50,901
She stays with me!

171
00:20:52,294 --> 00:20:55,123
You're in no position
to bargain,

172
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:58,213
no matter how much
you love your daughter.

173
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,303
Miss Sara Rossini, please.

174
00:21:28,199 --> 00:21:29,288
How did you know?

175
00:21:32,203 --> 00:21:33,379
Who told you?

176
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:48,959
I'm going to ask all of you
to follow my men upstairs.

177
00:21:49,003 --> 00:21:52,180
You'll be divided
in groups of ten

178
00:21:52,223 --> 00:21:56,706
and kept as prisoners
until the end of the operation.

179
00:21:58,969 --> 00:22:02,451
[gunmen shout indistinctly]

180
00:22:22,776 --> 00:22:24,647
[women scream]

181
00:22:28,303 --> 00:22:31,088
Let's go. It's fine. It's okay.

182
00:22:31,132 --> 00:22:33,264
It's okay, it's okay.

183
00:22:35,441 --> 00:22:36,659
Stop.

184
00:22:53,763 --> 00:22:55,330
[Mary screams]

185
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:06,297
Copy.

186
00:23:58,132 --> 00:23:59,873
[whispering]
Diana. Let's go.

187
00:24:10,536 --> 00:24:12,320
Leave him.

188
00:24:12,363 --> 00:24:14,235
I'm a doctor.

189
00:24:14,278 --> 00:24:17,325
I'm a soldier,
and it suits me to see him die.

190
00:24:17,978 --> 00:24:19,458
You bastard.

191
00:24:20,807 --> 00:24:22,330
Thank you.

192
00:24:22,373 --> 00:24:24,941
You go upstairs with the others.

193
00:24:28,205 --> 00:24:29,598
Take him away.

194
00:24:34,734 --> 00:24:36,779
How do you know about this room?

195
00:24:36,823 --> 00:24:37,998
Ah!

196
00:24:48,574 --> 00:24:51,272
[breathing heavily]

197
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:13,207
Give me your phone.

198
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,949
Give me your phone!
Come on.

199
00:25:17,603 --> 00:25:18,691
Come on!

200
00:25:20,867 --> 00:25:21,955
Go.

201
00:25:28,701 --> 00:25:29,789
Dad.

202
00:25:30,616 --> 00:25:31,704
Look.

203
00:26:00,036 --> 00:26:02,952
[grunting]

204
00:26:15,138 --> 00:26:17,314
[phone rings]

205
00:26:20,448 --> 00:26:22,232
You screwed it up already?

206
00:26:22,276 --> 00:26:23,799
Scott.

207
00:26:23,843 --> 00:26:27,455
You have to get the team
down to the Rossini villa, ASAP.

208
00:26:27,498 --> 00:26:29,500
We've got a hostage situation.

209
00:26:29,544 --> 00:26:31,372
Details?What's going on?

210
00:26:31,415 --> 00:26:33,330
[sighs]
Fifteen to 20 armed men.

211
00:26:33,374 --> 00:26:34,810
About 50 hostages.

212
00:26:34,854 --> 00:26:36,246
We need backup.

213
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:38,205
No. Mary's in there.

214
00:26:38,248 --> 00:26:39,467
What about your daughter?

215
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,947
She's with me.

216
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,688
Copy that.
With you in 20 minutes.

217
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,481
Okay.

218
00:26:53,524 --> 00:26:56,353
We're gonna have
to get you safe first.
You have to go by yourself.

219
00:26:56,397 --> 00:26:58,181
Yes.Go to the village.

220
00:26:58,225 --> 00:26:59,835
Where's your cell phone?

221
00:26:59,879 --> 00:27:01,532
I lost my purse.

222
00:27:03,056 --> 00:27:05,624
Okay. All right.

223
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:10,629
Here's some money.
Go down, find a hotel,
a restaurant.

224
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:11,804
Call me when you get there.

225
00:27:11,847 --> 00:27:13,762
All right?Okay.

226
00:27:13,806 --> 00:27:15,764
Okay, here we go. So...

227
00:27:17,113 --> 00:27:19,028
You'll be fine, all right?

228
00:27:23,903 --> 00:27:24,991
Okay?

229
00:27:25,731 --> 00:27:26,993
Okay.

230
00:27:28,124 --> 00:27:29,517
Talk to you soon.

231
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,099
Lock the perimeter.

232
00:27:56,762 --> 00:27:58,677
[machine beeps, hums]

233
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,600
[beeping continues]

234
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,261
Stop.

235
00:28:27,836 --> 00:28:30,752
Goro. Two are fucking down.

236
00:28:41,023 --> 00:28:43,809
Did you find the keys? No, sir.

237
00:28:52,121 --> 00:28:53,209
Stop!

238
00:28:56,517 --> 00:28:57,736
Move!

239
00:29:00,869 --> 00:29:03,350
Come on! I said move!

240
00:29:13,186 --> 00:29:15,797
You stay back. Be gentle.

241
00:29:15,841 --> 00:29:19,801
Doctor? Feeling
like saving someone?

242
00:29:19,845 --> 00:29:22,369
I prefer no women dying
in this operation.

243
00:29:24,327 --> 00:29:27,113
We need a flat surface.
The kitchen should do.

244
00:29:27,156 --> 00:29:29,811
-Kitchen?
-Yes. Can you get
your men to help me?

245
00:29:29,855 --> 00:29:32,118
Okay. Go.Yes, sir.

246
00:29:35,121 --> 00:29:36,296
[gunman]
All right, listen up.

247
00:29:37,993 --> 00:29:41,823
The doors are rigged
with explosives.

248
00:29:41,867 --> 00:29:44,217
And don't even try the windows.

249
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:47,655
Step outside and you're dead.

250
00:29:47,698 --> 00:29:50,266
Do you understand?
Do we have an understanding?

251
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:53,095
Yeah? Have I made myself clear?

252
00:29:53,966 --> 00:29:55,054
Yeah?

253
00:29:55,837 --> 00:29:56,882
Good.

254
00:30:04,411 --> 00:30:05,716
[Mary] She's been shot.

255
00:30:10,852 --> 00:30:13,812
[breathing raggedly]

256
00:30:15,117 --> 00:30:16,597
What's happened?

257
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,816
You've been shot.

258
00:30:18,904 --> 00:30:20,340
[woman] Oh...

259
00:30:20,383 --> 00:30:21,515
You're bleeding.

260
00:30:23,386 --> 00:30:25,127
Am I going to die?

261
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:28,087
No.

262
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:29,958
Not if we can get the bullet.

263
00:30:33,353 --> 00:30:37,879
Knives, alcohol,
sharp scissors,

264
00:30:37,923 --> 00:30:39,446
and lots of towels,
lots and lots of towels.

265
00:30:39,489 --> 00:30:40,708
Yes, of course.

266
00:30:44,451 --> 00:30:45,931
I've done it many times.

267
00:30:51,197 --> 00:30:54,374
You're going to be all right.
I've done this lots of times.

268
00:31:00,815 --> 00:31:02,948
[sighs]

269
00:31:02,991 --> 00:31:05,994
We found Ho-jin by the door,
Eito and Ki-nam out
on the perimeter.

270
00:31:06,038 --> 00:31:09,780
But Ho-jin's weapon is missing
and the police might be
on the way.

271
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:12,958
[Goro]
We knew we'd have to deal
with them at some point.

272
00:31:13,001 --> 00:31:16,744
But who is he?Don't know. No idea.

273
00:31:16,787 --> 00:31:19,181
Not on the list.
Last-minute arrival.

274
00:31:19,225 --> 00:31:22,489
I'd like to find out
for whom he works.

275
00:31:27,973 --> 00:31:29,148
Come on.

276
00:31:49,864 --> 00:31:51,735
Sir?

277
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:53,737
Cop car coming up solo.

278
00:32:17,587 --> 00:32:19,285
[in Italian]

279
00:32:32,602 --> 00:32:35,301
[gunshots][officers groaning]

280
00:32:36,258 --> 00:32:38,478
Good evening, officers.

281
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,961
[groans loudly]

282
00:32:50,925 --> 00:32:52,057
Bianchi?

283
00:32:53,058 --> 00:32:54,102
Bianchi?

284
00:32:55,451 --> 00:32:56,931
[captain on radio,
in Italian]

285
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:01,196
[in Italian]

286
00:33:07,855 --> 00:33:08,943
[Goro in English]
Take him in.

287
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,510
[Bianchi groaning]

288
00:33:10,553 --> 00:33:13,078
Hide the cars.
Maybe more cops are coming.

289
00:33:41,367 --> 00:33:44,152
Yeah?[Diana] Dad?

290
00:33:44,196 --> 00:33:45,980
[sighs] Are you okay?

291
00:33:47,199 --> 00:33:49,070
Yeah, I found the hotel.

292
00:33:50,593 --> 00:33:51,768
Okay, great.

293
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,990
I love you.

294
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,644
Dad?Yeah?

295
00:33:58,819 --> 00:34:00,995
Get Mary.I will.

296
00:34:23,148 --> 00:34:24,236
Here.

297
00:34:35,247 --> 00:34:37,858
[breathing heavily]

298
00:34:37,901 --> 00:34:40,861
[captain] Bianchi?[in Italian]

299
00:34:42,689 --> 00:34:44,212
[in Italian]

300
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:26,036
[in Italian]

301
00:36:11,952 --> 00:36:14,128
[in English]
You are going to get us killed.

302
00:36:16,609 --> 00:36:21,135
I don't think there's a sniper
allocated to our windows.

303
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,268
A bluff.Are you sure?

304
00:36:24,878 --> 00:36:26,140
Pretty sure.

305
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,663
I don't like "pretty."

306
00:36:29,578 --> 00:36:32,233
We can't wait for them
to kill us all, can we?

307
00:36:32,277 --> 00:36:34,496
They would have already done it
if they wanted to.

308
00:36:35,323 --> 00:36:36,498
Not sure.

309
00:36:54,821 --> 00:36:57,084
So that's what you came for?

310
00:36:57,127 --> 00:36:58,738
How do I open it?

311
00:37:04,831 --> 00:37:06,224
Sara!

312
00:37:06,267 --> 00:37:07,355
The code!

313
00:37:12,186 --> 00:37:13,883
I don't have it.

314
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,886
How am I to believe this?

315
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:22,152
One hostage.

316
00:37:22,196 --> 00:37:23,458
What are you doing?

317
00:37:23,502 --> 00:37:24,590
A test.

318
00:37:28,985 --> 00:37:31,074
[screaming]

319
00:37:40,345 --> 00:37:42,260
They're going to kill us
one by one.

320
00:37:54,402 --> 00:37:57,666
[on video: gunshot, screaming]

321
00:38:09,939 --> 00:38:11,680
Do you enjoy killing?

322
00:38:12,638 --> 00:38:13,682
Yes.

323
00:38:18,687 --> 00:38:22,691
We can keep on for quite
a while, but maybe...

324
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:29,132
Maybe you will be more receptive
if your daughter's life
is at stake.

325
00:38:32,005 --> 00:38:33,180
Ten.

326
00:38:33,876 --> 00:38:34,964
Nine.

327
00:38:35,791 --> 00:38:37,750
Eight.Dad!

328
00:38:37,793 --> 00:38:41,275
Seven. Six.

329
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,277
Five.All right!

330
00:38:44,713 --> 00:38:46,106
Stop.

331
00:38:54,897 --> 00:38:57,335
J-D...

332
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,076
W-K...

333
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,993
89-54-A-S.

334
00:39:06,648 --> 00:39:08,563
[lock buzzes, clicks open]

335
00:39:08,607 --> 00:39:11,610
I've been briefed that...

336
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,918
I need three keys
to open the vault.

337
00:39:15,962 --> 00:39:17,485
You had one.

338
00:39:17,529 --> 00:39:21,271
The other two are
in Singapore and in Paris.

339
00:39:21,315 --> 00:39:24,623
But not today.I don't know who has them.

340
00:39:25,754 --> 00:39:28,191
We have been preparing
for a scenario like this.

341
00:39:28,235 --> 00:39:32,587
I know,
but you do have information

342
00:39:32,631 --> 00:39:37,549
that those scumbags
you call shareholders

343
00:39:37,592 --> 00:39:40,639
may want to trade
for a few coins.

344
00:39:43,163 --> 00:39:47,733
Look. I'll give you 10 million
if you walk away right now.

345
00:39:48,777 --> 00:39:50,257
Ten million?Yes.

346
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,435
Wait, wait.

347
00:39:54,479 --> 00:39:57,307
There is 150 under our feet.

348
00:39:59,005 --> 00:40:00,528
Untraceable.

349
00:40:03,052 --> 00:40:04,184
Thank you.

350
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:07,143
No.

351
00:40:07,187 --> 00:40:09,232
No, thanks. Take them off.

352
00:40:11,496 --> 00:40:13,541
I have it. Keep her down.

353
00:40:13,585 --> 00:40:16,022
[both breathing heavily]

354
00:40:16,065 --> 00:40:17,806
Oh, God... That's...

355
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:19,329
Where's the bullet?

356
00:40:20,592 --> 00:40:22,115
Oh, God.

357
00:40:22,158 --> 00:40:24,726
I got it! I got it.

358
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:26,946
She's hemorrhaging!

359
00:40:26,989 --> 00:40:29,731
-What?
-Put pressure on the wound.

360
00:40:29,775 --> 00:40:32,952
We've got to take her
to a hospital. Push. Push!

361
00:40:34,257 --> 00:40:37,043
-Please hurry!
-Keep pushing.
Keep pushing really hard.

362
00:40:40,176 --> 00:40:41,264
Shit.

363
00:40:42,483 --> 00:40:43,789
Sophia...

364
00:41:05,071 --> 00:41:09,031
It's gonna take a while
without the other two keys.

365
00:41:09,075 --> 00:41:12,165
Every single guest went
through the metal detector.

366
00:41:14,907 --> 00:41:18,084
Wait. Zoom in on it.

367
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,870
I got it. It's not metal.

368
00:41:23,872 --> 00:41:28,747
I will strip naked
every single hostage
if I have to.

370
00:41:30,313 --> 00:41:32,620
You always manage to get
all the fun for yourself.

371
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:36,972
Janko, the keys are not metal.

372
00:41:37,016 --> 00:41:39,105
Check the hostages again.

373
00:42:02,302 --> 00:42:04,522
I know what they want
and how to find them.

374
00:42:05,305 --> 00:42:06,436
Where's Mary?

375
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,701
I have to find her first.

376
00:42:10,615 --> 00:42:12,530
We have to join forces.

377
00:42:12,573 --> 00:42:14,575
We'll go find her.Okay. Let's go.

378

379
00:43:23,862 --> 00:43:25,298
Drop the weapon.

380
00:43:29,389 --> 00:43:31,434
Who the fuck are you?

381
00:43:48,887 --> 00:43:50,105
[Sara] Freeze!

382
00:44:02,552 --> 00:44:04,206
It's my time, Dad.

383
00:44:07,253 --> 00:44:08,646
Why?

384
00:44:08,689 --> 00:44:10,473
[Sara]
You sell Rossini Enterprises

385
00:44:10,517 --> 00:44:14,129
as a great, conscious,
people-loving company.

386
00:44:14,173 --> 00:44:17,655
But I know what you did
in the Congo, Liberia, and Iran.

387
00:44:17,698 --> 00:44:21,528
I know about the illegal
financing and the child soldiers
occupying the mines.

388
00:44:23,356 --> 00:44:25,097
I know about the fields
in Afghanistan.

389
00:44:27,229 --> 00:44:30,537
It is what paid for everything
you've ever had.

Thank you.

393
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,293
You'll be rich.

394
00:44:48,642 --> 00:44:50,078
And I will be in power.

395
00:44:52,298 --> 00:44:53,603
Maybe.

396
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,567

What's the situation?

400
00:45:45,873 --> 00:45:48,093
Approximately
15 to 20 commandos.

401
00:45:48,136 --> 00:45:52,010
Apparently,
Rossini has a treasure
buried underneath the villa.

402
00:45:52,053 --> 00:45:53,794
How did they secure
the area?

403
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:56,231
Explosives all around
and sniper on the roof.

404
00:45:57,015 --> 00:45:58,146
Easy.

405
00:46:00,496 --> 00:46:02,760
But efficient. We shouldn't
underestimate these guys.

406
00:46:02,803 --> 00:46:03,848
Mary?

407
00:46:17,818 --> 00:46:18,732
Hey!

408
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:33,312
Just wanted to cut a tampon.

409

-What are you doing
with a half tampon?
-[Mary] Cooper.

411
00:46:39,884 --> 00:46:43,278
This thing
was actually developed
in World War I

412
00:46:43,322 --> 00:46:46,368
by a French surgeon
for bullet wounds.

413
00:46:47,369 --> 00:46:50,720
Only later, they realized...

414
00:46:50,764 --> 00:46:52,592
Well, you get the idea.

415
00:46:54,115 --> 00:46:55,508
Cooper, check the wound.

416
00:46:57,771 --> 00:46:58,816
[Cooper]
Still bleeding.

417
00:47:00,339 --> 00:47:02,950
Okay.[knife sawing]

She may wake up.

00:47:23,492 --> 00:47:24,580
How long?

Without the keys?

425
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:29,455
An hour.

426
00:47:32,588 --> 00:47:34,155
[Mary] All right.

427
00:47:34,199 --> 00:47:37,028
Just keep a light pressure
on the wound, okay?

428
00:47:37,071 --> 00:47:38,290
Okay.

429
00:47:41,467 --> 00:47:42,860

They're not in the main hall.

440
00:49:28,443 --> 00:49:31,142
They're upstairs.

441
00:49:31,185 --> 00:49:33,579
It looks like they've been
separated in different rooms.

442
00:49:38,018 --> 00:49:40,238
I've got visual on the sniper.

443
00:49:40,281 --> 00:49:41,935
He oversees the whole perimeter.

444
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:44,285
I'll have to take him out
before you can go in.

445

Good luck.

446

01:06:52,530 --> 01:06:54,967
I'm gonna check the others.
Stay quiet.

552
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:30,220
What's going on?

553
01:07:36,139 --> 01:07:38,184

554
01:07:47,672 --> 01:07:49,674

Okay. So, you can
just leave me here.

559
01:08:41,856 --> 01:08:43,684
[laughs] No. No way.

560
01:08:45,382 --> 01:08:48,167
-You don't need me.
-You'd be dead by now
if I didn't.

561
01:08:49,734 --> 01:08:51,518
But I know who you are.

562
01:08:54,173 --> 01:08:57,611
You're the wife,
therefore I do need you.

563
01:09:01,876 --> 01:09:03,661
Go get Mary.

564
01:09:03,704 --> 01:09:05,141

I'm okay.

01:12:27,734 --> 01:12:29,257
Shit.Just got a bad headache.

I'm with you.

590
01:13:10,516 --> 01:13:11,691
Where are they?

591
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:14,868
Most of them dead.

592
01:13:14,912 --> 01:13:17,393
It's over. Let's go outside.

593
01:13:19,133 --> 01:13:20,091
Sara?

594
01:13:29,448 --> 01:13:30,797
She said she forgave you.

[sobbing]

596
01:13:56,997 --> 01:13:59,478
What the fuck?

Left, left.
Fifty meters hard left,
90 degrees.

605
01:14:42,216 --> 01:14:45,219
Then 100 meters straight,
slight right at the fork.

606
01:14:48,048 --> 01:14:49,049
Stop here.

607
01:14:54,838 --> 01:14:57,928
[Emma]
Hundred meters straight,
slight right at the fork.

608
01:15:00,191 --> 01:15:02,193
This road leads right
to the red spot.

609
01:15:17,991 --> 01:15:19,863

610
01:15:19,906 --> 01:15:21,647

Not another step. Not one!

615
01:16:00,817 --> 01:16:02,732
Let her go.

616
01:16:02,775 --> 01:16:05,082
Not just yet!

617
01:16:05,125 --> 01:16:08,476
I don't care about the gold.
Just let her go.

618
01:16:11,218 --> 01:16:12,524
Don't come closer!

619
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:16,310
Bring me your car.

620
01:16:16,354 --> 01:16:19,400
I'll drive down the hill
and leave her there.

621
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:27,408
Deal.

622
01:16:41,335 --> 01:16:42,249

623
01:16:46,210 --> 01:16:48,647

01:17:28,339 --> 01:17:30,515

He got away with it.

636
01:18:55,513 --> 01:18:56,688
Do you think so?

637
01:19:07,917 --> 01:19:10,571
A couple of stitches
will do.

638
01:19:10,615 --> 01:19:13,096
I think it will be
more than a couple.

639
01:19:13,139 --> 01:19:14,837
But I'm glad you made it.So am I.

640
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:17,622

talking business at a party.And what a party.

It's okay.

650
01:20:06,062 --> 01:20:07,628
