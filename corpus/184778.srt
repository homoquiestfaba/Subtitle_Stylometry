1
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:20,000
DNA

2
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:55,940
-I never heard of him.
-Who?

3
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,520
The man you recommended.

4
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,050
The guitar fighter?

5
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:05,180
Wiped out a couple towns
single-handedly. A real nut. Yeah.

6
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,920
You heard of him. You just didn't know
it was him they were talking about.

7
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:11,220
You should meet him.

8
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,970
Me. Me. That's me.

9
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,130
As long as I'm not the guy
that has to make the introduction.

10
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:24,010
Were you in Mexico during
the Barillo cartel massacre?

11
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,080
No.

12
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,580
That's when I first heard about him.
He was a legend.

13
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,880
They used to say he was the biggest
Mexican they'd ever seen.

14
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:38,820
That was total bullshit.
He was 5'9", 5'10", tops.

15
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,720
That's no record,
but bigger than most of us.

16
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:46,230
But Marquez, that's a different story.

17
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,270
<i>Marquez.</i>

18
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,300
<i>Marquez.
Gen. Marquez.</i>

19
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,670
<i>Powerful, dangerous.</i>

20
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,870
<i>Marquez, he really had it in
for this Mariachi, see.</i>

21
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,260
<i>They called him "Mariachi"
because he used to carry this guitar.</i>

22
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,860
A guitar?

23
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,930
Believe me, he really knew
how to play it too.

24
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:48,930
Look, this story is well-traveled.

25
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:52,100
lt might have picked up some
embellishments along the way.

26
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:55,200
Just read between the lines.

27
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,370
<i>Now, he may not have been
the biggest Mexican ever...</i>

28
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,410
-All right.
-...but she was as deadly...

29
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,880
...as she was beautiful.

30
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:42,750
-There's a girl?
-Oh, yeah. There's a girl.

31
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,380
When he'd run out of ammo,
she'd take over.

32
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,120
The most drop-dead gorgeous
woman you'll ever see.

33
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,500
That's where all the trouble began.
She was with Marquez.

34
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:44,510
And when Marquez saw that she was
with the Mariachi, well, he went crazy.

35
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,450
He hunted him down and fought
Mariachi to the death. And then she...

36
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:54,390
...put a bullet in his heart.

37
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,530
Only he didn't die.

38
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:07,530
-I don't know what happened after that.
-Would you like some?

39
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,640
No. Maybe Marquez caught up
with them, or the cartels.

40
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,830
But like I said, the man
is a myth, a legend.

41
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:19,740
And if he's still living,
he's the one you want.

42
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,780
Well...

43
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,580
...that is truly unbelievable.

44
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,880
Well, I'm not big on telling stories.

45
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,490
Where's the money?
That's the reason I'm here.

46
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,650
I couldn't find a briefcase
small enough...

47
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:38,090
...for $10,000 in cash.

48
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,640
It'll do.

49
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:50,110
Just for my own edification,
I offered you 50.

50
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,300
-Why'd you say no?
-I'm not a greedy man.

51
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,780
Not looking to get rich quick.

52
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:00,980
Besides, 50,000 is a lot for what
you wanted me to find out, you know.

53
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,180
You may as just as well put a bullet
in my head as cough it up, right?

54
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,290
But 10?

55
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,120
Ten thousand is civilized.

56
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,730
Ten is something
we both can live with.

57
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,000
Ten might still be too much.

58
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,940
You'd kill me over $10,000?

59
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,010
You wouldn't dare.

60
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,850
You wouldn't dare.

61
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,810
Yes, I would.

62
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,560
Would you do me the honor?

63
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,570
You need to learn to play.

64
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,400
That's why you're here.

65
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,670
I hear this is a town of Gunmen.

66
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,670
We only make guitars here.

67
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,910
Mariachi.

68
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,840
Which one?

69
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:06,260
I don't know who you mean.

70
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:11,680
I'm honored to be in your presence.

71
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:15,320
But there's someone else who
wants to meet you.

72
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:25,140
Keep it. He made that for you.

73
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,930
You know, if I was you, son,
I'd turn around and go back right now.

74
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,190
Go back to where I came from...

75
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,600
...instead of selling my mind
and my soul to these cocksuckers.

76
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,640
You speak English?

77
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,310
I didn't think so.

78
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:12,120
Attempts have been made on me
and my family by the cartels.

79
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,820
The same cartels that are
threatening our freedom...

80
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,660
freedom which we must
defend to the death.

81
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:39,040
I present to you Señor Blascoe.

82
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,730
Please sit.

83
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:09,580
We hear you want to work for us.

84
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:19,750
I too am ready to start a new life.

85
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,390
This is your lucky day.

86
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:38,030
<i>Did you order my pibil?</i>

87
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:43,240
-Does it have a name?
-They call him "El."

88
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:45,610
As in "The."

89
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,840
I know what it means. Thank you.

90
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,710
Alert the Barillo cartel...

91
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:56,050
...that El has come out of hiding.

92
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,090
-I don't think we should--
-Are you a Mexican...

93
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,690
...or a Mexi-can't?

94
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,190
I'm a Mexican.

95
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,160
Good.

96
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,270
Then do as I say.

97
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,410
-Nice tune.
-Something my brother taught me.

98
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,180
I killed him.

99
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:30,290
Yes, I was privy to that
information already. How charming.

100
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:33,760
You know, El,
if I may call you that...

101
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:38,730
...I've been doing a little snooping
around, and it seems that the cartels...

102
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,960
...have quite a price on your head.

103
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:43,430
I wouldn't want to be you.

104
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,510
Tell me, is there anyone
who doesn't want you dead?

105
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,700
You tell me.

106
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,210
I need you to kill a man.

107
00:15:55,450 --> 00:16:00,220
<i>El, you really must try this
because it's puerco pibil.</i>

108
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:04,260
lt's a slow-roasted pork, nothing fancy.
lt just happens to be my favorite...

109
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:09,860
...and I order it with a tequila and lime
in every dive I go to in this country.

110
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:15,130
And honestly, that is the best
it's ever been anywhere.

111
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,460
ln fact, it's too good.

112
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,870
It's so good that when I'm finished,
I'll pay my check...

113
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,840
...walk straight into the kitchen
and shoot the cook.

114
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,580
Because that's what I do.
I restore the balance to this country.

115
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,180
And that is what I would like
from you right now.

116
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,620
Help keep the balance
by pulling the trigger.

117
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:35,650
-You want me to shoot the cook?
-No, I'll shoot the cook.

118
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,120
My car's parked
out back anyway. You...

119
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:42,120
...will kill Marquez.

120
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,300
Do you remember Gen. Marquez?

121
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,700
He's being paid by Barillo...

122
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:52,570
...to kill the president
in an attempted coup d'état.

123
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,570
-Attempted?
-Oh, no. The president will be killed...

124
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:00,510
...because he's that piece of good pork
that needs to get balanced out.

125
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,140
I say "attempted" because we don't
want Marquez taking power.

126
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,480
I need you to put the hurting,
so to speak, on Marquez...

127
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:10,820
...after he's killed
the president. Savvy?

128
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:14,830
-So why me?
-You've got nothing to live for...

129
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,330
...and, in a way, you're already dead.

130
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:20,500
And Marquez is the man
who killed you.

131
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:23,660
So why not return the favor?
Go to the church.

132
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:27,000
Meet with an associate
of mine named Salome at 3:00.

133
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:32,040
And I will contact you afterwards
if we have a deal.

134
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,020
Was I right?

135
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,320
I guess not.

136
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,240
The last shipment of guns
that were seized at our border...

137
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,610
...have not been
accounted for, Sanchez.

138
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:14,450
You are now off that assignment.
Who wants to volunteer?

139
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,780
Okay. You, Gomez, it's yours.

140
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,190
<i>With el presidente's new campaign
against the Barillo cartel...</i>

141
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,590
...their activities are being
pushed into the forefront.

142
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:30,530
Large payments, deliveries,
whispers of a political takeover.

143
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:34,230
I need new point men,
strong and willing.

144
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:39,540
<i>This is a top priority of el presidente.
Who wants this?</i>

145
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,640
Romero, it's yours.

146
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:45,410
Pick your secondary person.
A third, if you have to.

147
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:48,020
That's all. Dismissed.

148
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:52,180
I should take his left nut.

149
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,090
You're with us.

150
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,590
People of Culiacan.

151
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,870
I've come here to bring you a
message of peace.

152
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:10,840
Peace that at this moment is being
threatened by a group of people

153
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:13,000
that is threatening our nation.

154
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:15,410
People like Armando Barillo.

155
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,120
I invite you to gather our forces...

156
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,020
...in order to prevent the
destruction of our unity

157
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,880
...and our peace.

158
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,990
<i>El presidente, history teaches us
no matter how great your armies are...</i>

159
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,170
...you will always need
the favor of the inhabitants...

160
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:36,270
...to take possession of a province.

161
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,700
How can you compete with
a man like Barillo? He owns Culiacan.

162
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,500
He doesn't own its people.

163
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,240
Barillo purchased hundreds
of homes and ranches...

164
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,500
...in the northern part of Culiacan.

165
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,380
And then he has turned around
and given these homes to the people.

166
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:54,620
-He's a folk hero to them.
-He's also a mass murderer...

167
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,760
...and a drug kingpin.

168
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,880
He's trying to make himself a martyr
by drawing the people to his side...

169
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,260
...but the people can see through that.

170
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:07,900
Men like Barillo have stolen
this country's soul.

171
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,470
But my people will stand up
for what is right.

172
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,170
I'm afraid they're no longer
your people, sir.

173
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:19,200
Then I will die fighting.

174
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,810
Are you with me?

175
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,780
To the death.

176
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,960
What's wrong?

177
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,370
Everything.

178
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,700
This way!

179
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,640
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

180
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,740
Any suggestions, Miss "Let's
get a room on the fifth floor...

181
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,980
...so we can see
the beautiful sunset"?

182
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,190
Jump.

183
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,430
Swing, swing, swing.

184
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,640
-Hang on!
-What do you mean, hold on?

185
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,480
Let go now!

186
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,250
Give me that!

187
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,590
Stop the bus.

188
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,820
Stop the bus.

189
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:24,920
A vow must be broken.

190
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,490
Forgive me...

191
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:29,890
for what I am about to become.

192
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:36,800
-When was your last confession?
-An hour ago.

193
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:39,730
-And the name of your priest?
-Sands.

194
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:44,570
Okay. You are expected to carry out
your assignment to the letter--

195
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,510
-Yeah, I know.
-Failure to appear...

196
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,840
...in locations at assigned times...

197
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:53,450
...results in forfeit of protection,
protection you will definitely need.

198
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,350
-Yeah.
-You'll be paid.

199
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,750
Coup d'états, like elections,
don't come cheap.

200
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:02,160
So there's plenty of dough
floating around.

201
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,500
There's more.
You will be a free man...

202
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:09,600
...from Marquez, the cartels,
and even from the president...

203
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:12,740
...who isn't your biggest fan,
let's face it.

204
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:16,430
-When do I begin?
-Give me a moment.

205
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,520
<i>It's a church, hombre.</i>

206
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:38,180
I'm sorry.

207
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,800
Are you still standing?

208
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,740
Still.

209
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:06,110
<i>Good. Well, the Barillo cartel
aren't the nicest of guys, are they?</i>

210
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,510
However, you've passed the test.

211
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,620
You're gonna do just fine.

212
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:16,150
Assemble your team, and I will
call you with further instructions.

213
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,920
<i>Over and out.</i>

214
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:27,390
I'm just walking my beat, friend.
Mexico's my beat, I'm walking it.

215
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,500
I throw shapes, and they catch them.
I set them up and watch them fall.

216
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:35,810
Have him meet me
at the bullfight at 5 p.m. What?

217
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,640
Why would I want that?
Why would I want bubble gum?

218
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,350
All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

219
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:50,920
Okay, this should hold the both
of us over for quite a long time.

220
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:54,820
So I don't ever want to see you again.

221
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:56,930
Fuck off.

222
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:11,510
-Hi.
-Hello.

223
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,770
The CIA sharing a meal with the FBI.

224
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:19,180
Now, if that isn't interagency
cooperation, I just don't know what is.

225
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:21,910
-I'm retired FBI.
-A real agent never retires.

226
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:24,610
He just takes it a little easier.

227
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:30,260
-Why are we talking?
-You tracked down Armando Barillo...

228
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:33,830
...for two years when he was running
operations out of San Antonio.

229
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,490
Spinning wheels.
It never led to an arrest.

230
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,870
Well, he--

231
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:44,700
He is, in fact,
sitting directly behind you.

232
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,210
I know.

233
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:49,410
He settled back in.
He's been living here for six years.

234
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,410
Can't be touched.

235
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,920
Did you know that most agents
never even see a top-10 criminal...

236
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:58,990
...for their entire careers?
You brought down two, didn't you?

237
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:03,060
And now your third
is sitting in very close proximity.

238
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:05,890
Now, retired or not...

239
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:10,700
...that has really got to tug
on the old short and curlies.

240
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,130
I'm a civilian now.

241
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:16,740
Didn't he kill that agent friend
of yours? What was his name...

242
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:19,000
...Archuleta?

243
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,110
Yes.

244
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,640
Barillo is a Mexican citizen.

245
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,810
He cannot be extradited for crimes
committed in the U.S.

246
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:33,360
Do you happen to know of a
Dr. Guevera? Worked for the cartel.

247
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:39,290
This doctor pumped your friend
Archuleta full of drugs, day after day...

248
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:44,030
...so that they could torture him
for two weeks before he died.

249
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:46,000
You must have known that.

250
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,940
Dr. Guevera himself
having dinner with your prey.

251
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:55,670
I wonder what it is they're up to now.

252
00:30:56,450 --> 00:31:00,550
Two weeks of torture, Jorge.
Think about that.

253
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,580
For your dead friend...

254
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:05,480
...for the job you didn't finish
in San Antonio.

255
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:09,320
Now, are you really going to let it
slip away again?

256
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:19,000
I'd like you to have a bite
of my pork because it's...

257
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,460
...the world.

258
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,660
lt's Mariachi Happy Hour!

259
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:25,360
Get your Mariachi song for 5 pesos.

260
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,400
A Mariachi kiss for 20 pesos.

261
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,110
And a Mariachi fuck for only 50 pesos!

262
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,180
Where the hell have you been?

263
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,010
Far away.

264
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:39,920
Still fucking around?

265
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:43,750
Let me get Fideo.

266
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:47,360
I'm here for my guitar.

267
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,030
It's his last night.

268
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,970
They're firing him.

269
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:03,570
Hey...

270
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,570
...Fideo, it's me.

271
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:11,180
-Still drinking.
-Like a fish.

272
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:14,320
I guess we haven't changed so much.

273
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:21,720
I didn't think you'd ever
come back for this thing.

274
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:24,330
Neither did I.

275
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,730
Are we on?

276
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:30,060
I'll let you know.
I'll let you know.

277
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:38,010
Bring him sober.
We're gonna need him, so...

278
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,440
...coffee.

279
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:41,580
Lots of coffee.

280
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,910
Sometimes a revolution is exactly
what's needed to clean up the system.

281
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:48,250
One...

282
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:52,950
...giant enema, which just so happens
to be my area of expertise.

283
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:58,050
Bullfights. Bull hockey.
Do you like this?

284
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:02,530
The bull is stabbed,
prodded, beaten.

285
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:08,300
The bull is wounded.
The bull is tired before the matador...

286
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:12,570
...ever steps into the ring.
Now, is that victory?

287
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,750
Of course it is.

288
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:16,680
Wanna know
the secret to winning?

289
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:18,870
Creative sportsmanship.

290
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:20,820
In other words...

291
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,750
...one has to rig the game.

292
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,560
Go collect.

293
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:48,570
<i>El presidente is giving a speech
on the Day of the Dead...</i>

294
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,270
...in the town of Culiacan.

295
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:51,920
He's going to be isolated...

296
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,780
<i>...in the main edificio
in the center of the plaza.</i>

297
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:59,050
Very easy access to him if...

298
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,520
...somebody can get you in.

299
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:03,690
Right.
You're the man who can do that.

300
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,830
I am not the prince.

301
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,590
I am the man behind the prince.

302
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,570
-I see.
-He's not the first prince I've served...

303
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:15,300
...nor the first one that I've betrayed.

304
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:19,510
-You're a good rat. I like you.
-I try.

305
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:23,180
The rest upon completion.

306
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:26,610
<i>-Mucho gusto.
-Right. Right.</i>

307
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:35,750
Every goddamn time.

308
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:46,530
What do you want in life?

309
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,470
Belini...

310
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,340
...how long have you and I
done business together?

311
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:33,410
A long time.

312
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:35,510
And in a way...

313
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:40,240
...I kind of, almost, could have the
tiniest smidgen of respect for you.

314
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,110
Almost.

315
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:44,480
But you need to stop farting around.

316
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:48,180
Now, do you have the information
that I need on Barillo or do you not?

317
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,590
I have what you need.

318
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,730
I'm just enjoying this
temporary position of power.

319
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:56,530
That make you nervous?

320
00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:00,100
You know that withholding vital
information from a federal officer...

321
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:01,860
...is a serious offense.

322
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:05,940
Especially when that officer has paid
handsomely for it...

323
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:09,740
...and wouldn't think twice about
ripping that patch off your eyehole...

324
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,280
...and skull-fucking you to death.

325
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,110
No.

326
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:21,120
I'm fine. Go away.

327
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,990
I am fine. Go away.
You're off the hook.

328
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,760
Leave me alone.

329
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,100
That spill just cost you your life.

330
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,660
A little help.

331
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,370
Okay.

332
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,270
I know it's on you somewhere.

333
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:16,000
Somewhere.

334
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:22,480
All right.

335
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:24,750
Time to get messy.

336
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:45,770
Well, I suppose I should thank you
for not sticking it up your ass.

337
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:51,180
However.

338
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:02,490
You're about a quart low.

339
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,740
You're gonna pay for that, cop.

340
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:24,940
-Why doesn't my key work anymore?
-It's too small.

341
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:31,320
-Stand back.
-I just-- I brought you a gift.

342
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:32,790
I'm still mad at you.

343
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,220
And trust me,
it wasn't easy to get. So....

344
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,390
Come closer and I'll thank you.

345
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,840
-Are you trying to give me a boner?
-Closer, I said.

346
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,100
How about that little tip-off?

347
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:52,640
Guarantees you a big arrest
and an accommodation.

348
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:54,780
Even from your twisted little agency.

349
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:56,940
I'm impressed.

350
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,180
-But then what?
-Want to hear my plan?

351
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:01,950
Either that or I start target practice.

352
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:08,390
Okay. The new president is on a
quest to clear out the Barillo cartel.

353
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,660
And Barillo has set up
a counterattack...

354
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:15,270
...by hiring a military general
named Marquez.

355
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:17,990
<i>He wants him
to throw a coup d'état...</i>

356
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:21,370
<i>...while the president's
visiting Culiacan.</i>

357
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:24,600
<i>Now, I have a man inside
as insurance...</i>

358
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:27,210
<i>...to make sure that Marquez
never takes power.</i>

359
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:30,010
The last piece of the puzzle...

360
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:34,880
...is Barillo. Your tip-off assures...

361
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:38,980
<i>...that Barillo is out of the picture
while the battle ensues.</i>

362
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:43,460
<i>In the aftermath
of this very healthy revolution...</i>

363
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:48,760
<i>...I will calmly waltz away with
the 20 million pesos...</i>

364
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:52,400
<i>...that Barillo is prepared to pay
Marquez for the coup.</i>

365
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:55,100
-You want me to go with you?
-You detain Barillo...

366
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:58,570
...with the information that you have,
then you join me...

367
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,680
...and share the spoils.

368
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,280
You meet me two nights from now...

369
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:09,890
...at La Pileta, 10 p.m. sharp...

370
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:13,290
...and bring only
what's important to you.

371
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:17,690
Oh, yeah.

372
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:21,490
It might get a wee bit dangerous
there, sugar-butt. So....

373
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,130
-Can you dig it?
-I can dig it.

374
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:27,630
I want my key back.

375
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:39,940
Testing. One, two. Testing.

376
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:19,920
Hello?

377
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:21,920
Can you hear me now?

378
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:25,090
Okay-- Fucking bells.

379
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:27,600
Did you assemble your team?

380
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:29,560
You know I did.

381
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:34,010
<i>-Why are you having me followed?
-Oh, yeah, that. Let's just call that a...</i>

382
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:36,300
...guarantee of compliance, shall we?

383
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,240
Because Cucuy also...

384
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:41,310
<i>-...provides protection.
-From what? Mosquitoes?</i>

385
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,420
<i>Oh, gosh, I really wouldn't mess
with him if I were you...</i>

386
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,450
...because he's a bit of a live wire.

387
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:49,680
<i>And he's not the happiest
that you killed his man.</i>

388
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:53,120
<i>Oh, yeah, by the way,
I have your next assignment.</i>

389
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:06,330
You the Mariachis?

390
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:24,150
This is the back entrance.
Make a note of it.

391
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:40,860
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

392
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:42,340
Who are they?

393
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:44,040
Musicians.

394
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,350
Why so heavy?

395
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:56,180
Built in amplifier.

396
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:59,250
Play something.

397
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:02,920
All right.

398
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:21,170
Let's go.

399
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,110
-I was afraid you couldn't play.
-Are you kidding?

400
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:18,170
What we are looking for is support

401
00:46:18,370 --> 00:46:20,030
from the people of this state.

402
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:22,800
A man can do a lot alone,

403
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:27,300
but he can do better with his
people backing him.

404
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:31,080
I wonder how much
we're getting paid for this shit.

405
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:37,180
<i>A man who wants nothing
is invincible, cabrón.</i>

406
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,730
Hey.

407
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:52,370
Are you gonna tell him
that this is his last meal?

408
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,400
ls there a particular song you
would like to hear?

409
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:23,030
<i>We just played for el presidente,
I can't buy half a tequila with this shit!</i>

410
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,730
It was meant as an honor.

411
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:27,700
Fuck honor.

412
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:31,170
-We need money.
-The score's tomorrow. Enough for all.

413
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,680
Even for you, Lorenzo.

414
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:37,410
Why are you suddenly interested
in the score? What's in it for you?

415
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:39,410
Only revenge.

416
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,690
Much delayed revenge.

417
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:49,990
Go practice.

418
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,390
Practice?

419
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:56,160
Playing or shooting?

420
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:57,930
What do you think?

421
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,470
I don't think. I drink.

422
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,240
-Yeah, hello.
-Been following Barillo...

423
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:16,080
-...and the good Dr. Guevera.
-Oh, Agent Ramirez, no longer retired.

424
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:20,090
-Good man. Welcome to the fold.
-I haven't seen illegal activities yet.

425
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:23,460
Only that Dr. Guevera is scheduled
for a medical procedure...

426
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:24,960
<i>...on November 2.</i>

427
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,150
The Day of the Dead. That's tomorrow.

428
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:30,930
Also identified a member of the group
as Billy Chambers.

429
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:34,440
A fugitive. We've been wanting
to pick him up for some time now.

430
00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:37,580
Billy Chambers? Yeah. You sure?

431
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:39,800
<i>-Bet my badge on it.
-Well...</i>

432
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:42,740
<i>...whatever they're up to,
I can guarantee you...</i>

433
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,940
...that it's going
to happen tomorrow.

434
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,810
<i>-So I suggest you--
-What's going down tomorrow?</i>

435
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:50,010
If you see an opening, take it.

436
00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:53,750
-What do you know?
-Not enough. Get inside.

437
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,290
I've got nothing.

438
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:05,360
I gotta get in. I got nothing.

439
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:09,370
Try to make a move.
I don't have a move to make.

440
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,000
What are you gonna do, stupid?

441
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:20,920
Billy Chambers is on the move.

442
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:26,650
Where are you going?

443
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,990
You're buying a taco.

444
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,100
This is too easy.

445
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,430
Where are the other guys?

446
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,300
This is a setup.

447
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:41,900
It smells like a setup.

448
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:50,510
I'm making my move.

449
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,750
Billy Chambers.

450
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:34,420
-Well, that depends who's asking.
-I thought that was you.

451
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:37,550
-Here, let me pay for this.
-Oh, well, thanks.

452
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:42,190
Oh, goddamn it.

453
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,460
-Is that real?
-Yes, it is.

454
00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:48,670
Goddamn.
What took you boys so long?

455
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:51,930
Whoa, hey, friend.

456
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:55,040
You ain't gonna need that.

457
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:58,810
Believe it or not, man, I'm ready to go.

458
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,580
Let's talk over there.

459
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:05,490
After you.

460
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:13,020
Man, I just wanna get out of here.

461
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:16,130
I've been on the run, hiding out here
down in Mexico...

462
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:20,500
...for the last eight goddamn years.

463
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:25,110
And I've been working
for this here cartel for the last four.

464
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:28,880
I ain't got shit. All I got
is what I'm wearing on my back.

465
00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:32,110
I can't go nowhere.
Sort of got me by the balls, you know?

466
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:34,550
Jorge Ramirez.

467
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:39,210
I'll take you in under the FBI's
supervision and protection...

468
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:45,260
...until we can take you back, where
you will be prosecuted for your crimes.

469
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:47,660
-In the U.S.?
-In the U.S.

470
00:51:49,370 --> 00:51:53,390
The things that I've had to do
for the goddamn cartel are...

471
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:57,060
-...unspeakable.
-You don't know what Barillo's up to?

472
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,270
I'm close to the man.

473
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:01,870
I'm real close.

474
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:04,780
But he don't let nobody in,
that cocksucker.

475
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:07,110
Can you get him close to Barillo?

476
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:13,260
Him?

477
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:16,060
I need your help.

478
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:22,790
Then you get me out of here.

479
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:25,030
Then I'll get you out of here.

480
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:27,670
Him too.

481
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:28,430
Him too.

482
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,310
There's cartel on every corner.

483
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:13,210
Sands told me you handle protection.

484
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:15,750
I don't work for Sands anymore.

485
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:19,020
And since I'm a Mexican,
I can do whatever I want.

486
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,990
Then I guess
I don't work for Sands neither.

487
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,690
-Goodbye.
-There's a price on your head.

488
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:29,830
I'm going to collect. Why don't you
just tell Barillo everything you know.

489
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,660
And then maybe
he'll just cut off your hands.

490
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,100
And if I don't?

491
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:36,930
You know that old man
I killed in your village?

492
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:39,270
What if your whole village was next?

493
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:43,610
Would you kill them?

494
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:46,220
Me? They certainly would.

495
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:51,250
Then I guess I have no choice...

496
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,220
...but to kill you all.

497
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,600
You...

498
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,340
...are last.
