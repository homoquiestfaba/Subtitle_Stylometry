1
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,560
Okay. One picture
and we're history.

2
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,840
That's what I'm afraid of.

3
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,960
Come on.

4
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,840
<i>Oh, man, do we
have to do this?</i>

5
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,680
You want everyone
at school to think
we're chicken?

6
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,560
I could live with that.
You wuss. Come on.

7
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,400
Oh, whoa!
Oh, man!

8
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,440
L-I don't see anything.
Do you?

9
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,920
No, I don't
see anything.

10
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,040
Let's just take the picture
and get outta here.

11
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,160
Fine, fine. Here,
take the picture.

12
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,640
Now, wait a minute. I gotta
be in the picture too, or no one
will believe I was here.

13
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,080
Just shut up
and take the picture.
No, you take the picture.

14
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,000
You take it.
You!

15
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,600
<i>Guys, guys, don't fight.
I'll take the picture.</i>

16
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,520
<i>Say cheese!</i>

17
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,880
<i>A ghost!</i>

18
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,760
<i>And to the Save The Dolphins
Foundation: $ 11 million.</i>

19
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,920
To the Save The Pumas
Foundation: $1.2 million.

20
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,360
To the Patagonian Wasp
Salvation Fund: $1.4 million.

21
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,480
<i>To the Dyslexic
Dalmatians Foundation:4...</i>

22
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,480
To hell with the livestock.
What'd the old stiff
leave me?

23
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,760
Um, I believe that
what the bereaved...

24
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,600
is trying to express
is that the sudden death...

25
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,560
<i>of her only father has
left a great gaping void...</i>

26
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,760
in her bank...
in her life.

27
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,640
Carrigan wonders what he has
left her to fill it up with.

28
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,200
Hmm. Let's see.

29
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,840
Bobcats, owls,

30
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,320
<i>snakes.</i>

31
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,000
<i>Daughter: Carrigan.</i>

32
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,200
Whipstaff Manor in Maine.

33
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,480
And?

34
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,840
And I'm late for lunch,
so if you'll excuse me.

35
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,360
Are you trying to tell me
that I just spent
the last two days...

36
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,160
holding his clammy hand,
waiting for him to kick,

37
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,760
and all I get in return
is one lousy piece of property?

38
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,120
<i>No, it was lousy 50 years ago.
Now it's condemned.</i>

39
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,040
Enjoy.

40
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,200
Wait a minute!
This is not fair!

41
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,600
<i>I'll contest it, then I'm gonna
drag you and every one of
those damn dolphins into court!</i>

42
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,840
Knock yourself out.

43
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,920
Dibs! This is all
your fault, as usual.

44
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,560
If you would have just
forged the damn will.

45
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,440
<i>Carrigan, this is
condemned seafront property.</i>

46
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,320
Oh, Dibs!
Don't you get it?

47
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,320
Flipper got more money
than me.

48
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,440
Carrigan,
the deed's in there!

49
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,400
Oh! Ouch!

50
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,280
Ow. Ouch!

51
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,960
"Buccaneers
and buried gold.

52
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,640
Whipstaff doth
a treasure hold."

53
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,960
Treasure?
Dibs, you idiot!
Get it out!

54
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,960
I knew that place was
worth something. There's
treasure in that house.

55
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,080
And finally, I'm gonna
get what I deserve.

56
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,400
Carrigan,
I think I need a doctor.
Oh, there's plenty in Maine.

57
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,360
So... what do you think?

58
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,680
I think you're
gonna get wet.

59
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,520
Hey! Wait!
Carrigan!

60
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,920
Carrigan!

61
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,200
Dibs, light, light!

62
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,240
What a dump.

63
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,880
<i>Wow. Wow!</i>

64
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,680
This place is fabulous.
You could just do
so much with it.

65
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,440
I mean, it's
a bit spooky.
Dibs.

66
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,920
Aaah! Aaah!

67
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,520
<i>Hello.
Huh?</i>

68
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,760
Who is it?
Who is it?

69
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,080
<i>Afraid I can't
answer that.</i>

70
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,040
Why not?
Why not?

71
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,440
<i>It's kind of hard
to explain. Uh...</i>

72
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,240
Is he the caretaker?
Are you the caretaker?

73
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,880
<i>No!
Is he a transient?</i>

74
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,480
<i>Is he...
Are you a transient?
No, not exactly.</i>

75
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,880
Tell him
to show himself.
Show yourself!

76
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,480
<i>Here's the thing.
If I do, don't scream, okay?</i>

77
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,520
<i>I get that a lot.</i>

78
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,880
Are you a burglar?
I must warn you
that I am armed.

79
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,360
Hello?

80
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,320
Listen!
Cut the crap, okay?

81
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,080
If you don't show yourself,
I'm gonna have you arrested
for trespassing!

82
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,000
<i>Okay, okay.
Geez, calm down, lady.
Here I come!</i>

83
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,120
Hi! I'm Casper!

84
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,200
You shouldn't do that
or you'll wake up...

85
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,560
Too late.

86
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,120
So tell me,
you have experience?

87
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,840
I have-a quite a bit
of experience.

88
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,400
Not, you know,
like, exactly doin' it.

89
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,200
But I've studied it,
and I've talked to people
who have done it.

90
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,720
I've-a seen videos,
and I feel very confident
with-a my knowledge...

91
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,640
I could do it,
no problem.

92
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,800
Then you can
handle this?
It's-a no problem.

93
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,480
<i>It's-a like no problem
whatsoever. Piece of cake.
Piece of crumb cake.</i>

94
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,960
Well?
How did it go?

95
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,280
Oh, it was-a fine.
Was, uh, no problem.
Piece of cake.

96
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,720
Who you gonna call?

97
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,960
Someone else.

98
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,000
What do we do now?

99
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,360
What do I usually do
when something stands
in my way?

100
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,880
<i>Check those fuses!</i>

101
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:33,960
Um, are you sure
we're not going
a tad overboard here?

102
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,320
Dibs, I have huffed and puffed.
Now I want to rip
this place down.

103
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,920
I want my treasure.
They can't haunt a pile
of rubble, for Christ's sake.

104
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,960
<i>People, people, please!</i>

105
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,400
You're sweaty
male construction types,
for Christ's sake!

106
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,000
Dibs, do something.

107
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,800
Charlie, quick, keep runnin'!
Don't look back!
Run, Charlie, run!

108
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:07,280
<i>Wait, wait. They were
just kidding. Honest!</i>

109
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,560
Oh, every time.
All I want's a friend.

110
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,960
Did you ever feel the way
Priscilla Cow felt?

111
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,640
That you'd like to be
completely different?

112
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,360
Almost everybody feels
like that once in a while.

113
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,280
But most of the time,
I hope you can be glad
to be yourself.

114
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,680
That's really
something to celebrate.

115
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,400
A g-g-ghost!

116
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,800
More on the Pentagon playboys
as the story unfolds, but now:

117
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,440
Step aside, Sigmund Freud.
Jump back, Joyce Brothers.

118
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,160
It's Dr. James Harvey,
therapist to the dead?

119
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,520
Are you depressed, anxious?

120
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,120
Are you lonely?
Do you need someone to talk to?

121
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,240
No problem,
if you're a ghost.

122
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,600
You can call them ghosts,
if you like, or as I prefer,

123
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,520
the living impaired.

124
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,320
But the bottom line is,
they need help sometimes.

125
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,400
Just like the rest of us.

126
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,800
After the sudden, unexpected
death of his wife Amelia,

127
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,920
Dr. Harvey gave up
conventional psychiatry and,
some say, conventional sanity.

128
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,280
Now, along with his
loner daughter, Kat...
short for Kathy...

129
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,520
Doc Harvey travels from
town to town, searching
for paranoid poltergeists,

130
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,920
scared specters,
the depressed and the dead.

131
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,640
How do you feel about what
your father does for a living?

132
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,600
Could you please
not ask me any questions?

133
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,640
Do you believe
in ghosts? Ever seen one?
Does your father ever hurt you?

134
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,840
He's my father.
Could you just talk to us?

135
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,520
Look, it's the first day of school.

136
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,200
I'm sure I'm gonna have homework,
so would you please?

137
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,680
Carrigan.

138
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,280
<i>What part don't
you understand?</i>

139
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,840
But who is this man...

140
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,160
No, not "I ate fish".
I hate fish.
Don't you have cows here?

141
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,040
Listen, I have had
a long and trying day.

142
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:25,160
Do you think you could bring me
a pint of Haagen-Dazs ice cream,
rum raisin, and a Diet Pepsi?

143
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,080
Think you can handle that?

144
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,720
Now you want me to hold.
Fine.

145
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,600
With therapy, they can
begin to process this pain.

146
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,560
They can pack up
their emotional baggage,
and they can move on.

147
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,720
My Harry passed away
five years ago,

148
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,560
but he was so miserable,
his spirit wouldn't leave
the apartment.

149
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,920
So I called Dr. Harvey.
He came over.

150
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,240
And in a few weeks,
Harry left, smiling.

151
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,600
<i>The living impaired
are known for haunting us.</i>

152
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,680
<i>My question is,
what's haunting them?</i>

153
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,560
It's a lack of resolution.

154
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,840
Ghosts are simply spirits
without resolution,
with unfinished business.

155
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,120
It's my job to find out
what that is.

156
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,600
<i>And so Dr. Harvey continues
his work, dragging his daughter
along for the ride.</i>

157
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,760
This week they're in Santa Fe.
But next week? Boo knows?

158
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,000
<i>Now, from the ghost shrink
to shrinking thighs.
Yes, I'm still here.</i>

159
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,120
<i>The miracle fat cream
experiment, next.
Get me Santa Fe.</i>

160
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,120
<i># That's life #</i>

161
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,560
<i># That's life #
# That's life #</i>

162
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,520
# That's what
all the people say #

163
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,640
# You're ridin' high in April
shot down in... #

164
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,560
Oh, honey, I'm sorry
about your Cactus Spooners.
Crooners.

165
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,880
I don't care what they said.
You are not demented.

166
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,080
<i>You're a picture
of mental health.
They were talking about you.</i>

167
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,680
Try explaining
afterlife therapy to
a bunch of junior high kids.

168
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,880
Some people go through life
never questioning the norm.

169
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,240
But you and I, we're doing
something extraordinary
with our lives.

170
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,800
<i>No, we aren't doing anything.</i>

171
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,160
You're the one who's been
packing up my stuff and
moving me around the country.

172
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,360
In two years, I have been
to nine different schools.

173
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,240
I have eaten in nine
different cafeterias.

174
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,720
I can't even
remember anyone's name.

175
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,120
For once, I would
just like to be...

176
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,000
in one place long enough
to make a friend.

177
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,280
Honey, you will.

178
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,280
I mean, come on.
We're movin' to
Friendship, Maine.

179
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,520
Even I might make one.
You better, Dad.

180
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,080
'Cause a single guy your age
is more likely to become
a bank hostage...

181
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,040
than to make new friends.

182
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,000
You sound like your mother.

183
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,720
You're not gonna find her.

184
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,840
Mom's not a ghost, Dad.

185
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,440
Oh, yes, she is.
She has unfinished business.

186
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,440
There's no such thing
as ghosts.

187
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,280
I'll tell you what.
You go with me
this one last time.

188
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,160
If I don't find what
I'm looking for, it's over.

189
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,040
No more moving,
no more ghost mining.

190
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,120
You promise?

191
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,840
I promise.

192
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:40,040
Deal.

193
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,200
Wow! It's not
so bad, huh?

194
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,680
If you're Stephen King.

195
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:18,480
Dr. Harvey, hello.
I'm Carrigan Crittenden.

196
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,440
And this is Dibs.
Hello.

197
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,080
I'm a close,
personal friend.

198
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,600
Ah.
And this is my daughter, Kat.

199
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,000
His close,
personal daughter.

200
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,920
How nice to meet you,
Kat.
Very nice to meet you.

201
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,880
You have
a beautiful daughter.
Very beautiful.

202
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,080
I can't tell you
how happy we are
you could come to Whipstaff.

203
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,640
Very happy.
The both of us.

204
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,560
You're kind of
hurting my face.

205
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,520
Sorry. Now, Dr. Harvey,

206
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,720
<i>exactly what time frame
are you looking at?</i>

207
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,760
Tell me you go
in the house and spray
and that's it.

208
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,280
Pssssst!
No, no, no.

209
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,360
As with a traditional
psychological cure, it can
take weeks or years for...

210
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,000
Excuse me. You didn't
just say the word "years",
did you?

211
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,120
It's conceivable.
No, it isn't.

212
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,160
- Days is conceivable.
Weeks, maybe.
- Possibly.

213
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,800
- Months? No.
Years? Forget it!
- Forget it.

214
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,240
Dibs, check.

215
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,480
Get the bouquet.
Now, Dr. Harvey.

216
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,280
I will be watching you
very closely.

217
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,840
These are for you!
Have a lovely night.

218
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,360
Wow.

219
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,880
It's her. She's here.
She's in my house. I did it!

220
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,080
What if she likes me?
What if she doesn't?

221
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,760
Hi, I'm Casper.
I'm a ghost?

222
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,240
No, that's total disaster. Oh!

223
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,160
Yo, I'm Casper.
So, give me four.

224
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,800
Oh, God,
I'd kill for a pinky.

225
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,560
Huh? See?
That was easy.

226
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,720
Yeah. These should hold for now,
but we ought to get a box
of 20 amps in the morning.

227
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,680
Oh, uh,
right, yeah.

228
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,280
Uh, twenties
should be fine.

229
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,040
All right, I'm gonna
go find a room, Dad.

230
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,000
You gonna be
all right alone?

231
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,800
Hey, if I'm not
back in ten days,
send a search party.

232
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,280
<i>"Stretch",</i>

233
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,640
<i>"Fatso"...</i>

234
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,600
<i>and "Stinkie"?</i>

235
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,240
Man, they had cruel parents.

236
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,240
Wonder where
Doc and Dopey sleep.

237
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,680
Dad! I found my room.

238
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:30,440
There's a girl...
on my bed. Yes!

239
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,720
Hey, space master.

240
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,200
In here.
Oh.

241
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,760
<i>It's very scary.</i>

242
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,320
Have you seen
any surprises yet?

243
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,520
Please. This is
the deadest place yet.

244
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,600
Oh, this is
a nice room.

245
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:54,480
Yeah, right. This place
is a freak's holiday.

246
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,960
Hi... Ooh! Ooh!

247
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,520
<i>Oh.
Oh.</i>

248
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,280
Mom belongs over here.

249
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,600
Hey, how about
if I help you unpack?

250
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,560
Why bother?
We'll just be repacking
in two weeks anyway, right?

251
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,720
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
This place is... fine.

252
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,280
Good. Night, Bucket.

253
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,320
Night, Dad.

254
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,680
We're gonna be glad we came.
You watch.

255
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,920
Wh... Whoa!

256
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,400
Ooh, ooh!

257
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,280
Uh...

258
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,320
I... No.

259
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,160
I...

260
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,520
Uh...
Uh... Hi?

261
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,920
Oh, man!

262
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,920
Perfect first impression.
What a jerk.

263
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,880
Better?

264
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,640
<i>Honey?</i>

265
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,800
Hon... Honey?
Honey, what?

266
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,080
Dad, Dad,
I saw a ghost!

267
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,680
It was a real ghost.
It was a real, live ghost.
Slow down. What?

268
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:37,640
I saw a ghost.
It had a head, and it was round,
and it was white and see-through.

269
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,400
Honey, wait.
Now maybe...
Dad, please.

270
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,920
Do not think I'm as crazy
as I thought you were.
I promise.

271
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,320
No, no, no.
But remember, ghosts
can't hurt you, okay?

272
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,440
They're simply spirits
with unfinished business.

273
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,560
Let's just see
about this ghost.

274
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,480
Come here. Come on.

275
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:00,320
Check here. Oop, see?
No ghost there.

276
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,400
Now we can check over here.

277
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,000
Nope.

278
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,240
Oh! No, there's
no ghost in there.

279
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,240
We can even check over here.

280
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,160
There. See?

281
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,120
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

282
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,960
Dad!
Put me down!

283
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,880
This is insane.
What are you doing?

284
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,800
I can walk, you know?

285
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,240
<i>Oh, my God,
this is big.</i>

286
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,440
<i>Um, Dad?
What?</i>

287
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,920
<i>We're in a closet.</i>

288
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:48,040
Right. Now, I want you
to stay in here...

289
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,200
no matter what
you hear, okay?

290
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,160
Okay.
Okay.

291
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,160
Wait.
What?

292
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,360
Dad, I'm sorry.
For what?

293
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:00,360
For not believing you.
For thinking you were
a total loser.

294
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,840
Aw, honey...
Apologize later.

295
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,000
Blew it, blew it,
blew it, blew it...

296
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,560
<i>Yee-haw!
Uh-oh, it's them.</i>

297
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,040
Here they come!

298
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,200
Yee-haw!

299
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:22,000
Man, oh, man,
them ponies run faster
when we go down to Belmont.

300
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,880
Here, Flicka.
Bleaaugh!

301
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,320
Hey, guys.
Have fun?

302
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,520
Oh, look, it's Casper.
Casper.

303
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,280
You know on a scale
of one to ten...
ten being fun,

304
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,760
and one being you...
yeah, we had fun.

305
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,880
Giddyup there.

306
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:43,080
Say, bulbhead, why ain't you
inside doin' your chores?

307
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,600
Yeah, where's dinner?
I'm starvin'.
I'm wastin' away.

308
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:51,160
I know. How about you guys
relax out here, and tonight
we'll eat al fresco?

309
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,240
Hey, sounds great.
Who's that?

310
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,880
Short sheet, you wouldn't
be trying to keep us
outta the house, would ya?

311
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,320
No! No!
I can see right through
that bulbous head of yours.

312
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,400
It's just such
a lovely night.

313
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,440
I thought we'd
have fun eating
under the harvest moon.

314
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,760
# Shine on #

315
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:12,960
# Shine on, harvest moon
Up in the sky #

316
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,600
<i>Aaah!
Bye-bye!</i>

317
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,000
Hey, hold it.

318
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,640
Hey, Fatso,
you smell somethin'?
Yeah!

319
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,480
<i>No, besides him.
Hello?</i>

320
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,760
Huh? Hey!

321
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:38,440
<i>Hello?</i>

322
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,000
<i>No need to be afraid.</i>

323
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,960
The idea, don't be afraid.

324
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:50,720
I'd like to make contact
with you, but just one
little thing, please.

325
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:55,400
Don't pop out from under a rug
or through a keyhole.
No spooking.

326
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,880
Let's get beyond that.
I would like to approach you.

327
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,800
Now, I'm coming
in the room now.

328
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:06,760
I'm in, in the room.

329
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,520
Can ya deal with that?

330
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,800
<i>Can you?</i>

331
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,640
Dive!
Dive!

332
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,480
Dive! Huh?

333
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,080
<i>Dad!</i>

334
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,160
Dad?

335
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,440
I'm gonna kill you,

336
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:58,080
your mama and all her
bridge-playin' friends.

337
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:03,240
You think you got it tough?
I got a face-lift. There was
one just like it underneath.

338
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,040
Hmph? Hmph?

339
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,440
Aaah!

340
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,200
Aah! Aah-aah!

341
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,320
Aaah!

342
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,640
Aah!

343
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,800
<i>Dad? Dad?</i>

344
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,240
Hey, boys, we got
a closet case here.

345
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,760
Smell-o-gram.

346
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:54,640
<i>Sushi, anyone?
California roll coming up.</i>

347
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,960
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!

348
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,520
All for one, and one for all!

349
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,080
Catch your pants
before they fall.

350
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:06,480
On the runway now,
we have Dr. James Harvey,
wearing smashing underwear.

351
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,560
Marky Mark he's not!

352
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,280
You are good.

353
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,240
Oh, stop. It's you.
Are we scary or what?

354
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,560
Aiii-ya!

355
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,480
Oh, and it looks as if
we're gonna go into
sudden death overtime.

356
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Anybody for
a little shish ka-doc?
I am!

357
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,240
Hah!

358
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,480
Yeow!

359
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,120
Ha-ha!

360
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,720
<i>En garde!
Ha, ha!</i>

361
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,680
Kitchie-koo!

362
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,040
Who do you think you are,
defiling our domicile, huh?

363
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,000
Dr. James... Harvey,
your... therapist.

364
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:09,000
Dad? Dad?

365
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,040
Are you okay?

366
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,600
Dad?

367
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,560
Dad?

368
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,000
Yaa!

369
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,680
<i>He's down for the count.</i>

370
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,240
<i>The winner...
by a clean stink-out!</i>

371
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,720
Ha!

372
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,720
Get back.
What the hell
is that thing?

373
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,640
Ha, ha!

374
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,760
Not the nose!

375
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,360
I'm bein' hosed!

376
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,080
No, no, no, no, no!

377
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,480
Th-Th-This sucks!

378
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,640
<i>Dad?</i>

379
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,560
Are you okay?

380
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:15,520
Oh, I'm fine.
Why don't we go,
uh, regroup?

381
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,040
<i>Get your hand
out of my mouth!</i>

382
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,960
<i>Oh, man, who let one?
Well, who do you think?</i>

383
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,080
<i>Who's got their
pointy head in my...
That's not my head.</i>

384
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,280
<i>You know, fellows, we're
never this close anymore.</i>

385
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,680
Morning!

386
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,440
Oh, no, please don't scream.
L-I promise I won't hurt you.

387
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,840
I'm a ghost, yes, I admit it.
But I'm a friendly ghost.
You have to trust me.

388
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:18,280
If you scream,
you'll wake up my uncles,
and they get awfully cranky.

389
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,360
I'm gonna
let you go now, okay?

390
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,600
You're so cold.

391
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:29,640
Yeah, but it saves
on the heating bill. Ha!

392
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,440
<i>Come on.</i>

393
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,360
It's okay.

394
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,800
I can see
right through you.

395
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,920
Kind of happens
when you don't have any skin.

396
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,280
Wh... What are you made of?

397
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:52,360
Well, you know that
tingling feeling when
your foot falls asleep?

398
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:56,800
I think
I'm made of that.

399
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,880
Um, sunny-side up
kind of makes me yak.

400
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,200
No problem.

401
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,200
So, can you go invisible?

402
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,680
Ha, ha.
That one's easy.

403
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,000
It's fresh.

404
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,240
Go ahead.

405
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,520
I've never
done this before.
Me neither.

406
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,200
Can you hurt me?
N-No.

407
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,160
Can I hurt you?
No.

408
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,360
Cool.

409
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:29,200
Morning, Dr. Harvey.
Uh, some breakfast?

410
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,360
Uh, hmph. Uh...

411
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,760
Well, uh, yeah.

412
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,840
Honey? You okay?

413
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,800
Good.

414
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,600
<i>How about a paper?
The New York Times?
The Journal?</i>

415
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,360
<i>Hong Kong Press?
Sure.</i>

416
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,280
Comin' at ya.

417
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,760
Well...
Hope you're hungry.

418
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,760
# Da, da-da-da, da
Da, da-da-da, da #

419
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:27,640
# Da, da-da-da, da
Da, da-da-da, da #

420
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:34,240
I love the smell
of fleshies in the morning.

421
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,440
I'm melting!
I'm melting!

422
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,760
Auntie Phlegm!
Auntie Phlegm!

423
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:50,360
<i>Oh, what a world!</i>

424
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:54,240
What a world!

425
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,840
They're gone.
What happened?

426
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,360
They must have
crossed over.

427
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,520
Don't think so!
Guess again, bonebag!

428
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,600
Fellas, good morning.

429
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,440
Casper!

430
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:30,760
How dare you serve
these air-sucking intruders
before us.

431
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,160
I was just...
Give me...

432
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,160
My meal!

433
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,040
Okay, okay.

434
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,880
Mmm!
Mmm!

435
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,560
Mmm!

436
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,280
<i>I feel like Oprah
on hiatus.</i>

437
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,600
<i>You look like
Oprah on hiatus.</i>

438
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,840
Ketchup, please.

439
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,600
Yum, yum! Yum!

440
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,960
You know what the problem is?
Casper's got no respect for us.

441
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,920
After all we've done
for the little glowworm.

442
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,120
Yeah. What the hell do you
think you're doin', bulbhead?

443
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,680
<i>This floor used to be
dirty enough to eat off of.</i>

444
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,920
But we have company.
Oh, yeah?

445
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,080
Well, company loves misery.
Boom!

446
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,920
You guys are disgusting,
obnoxious creeps.

447
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,480
Thank you!

448
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,000
What's your problem?
He's just cleaning the floor.

449
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:31,160
Shut up, skinbag.
Piss off.

450
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,480
Take a hike.
Get a grave.

451
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,200
Honey!
You've got the school thing.
You don't wanna be late.

452
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,120
<i>"Don't wanna be late".
Drop dead!</i>

453
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,640
<i>- It's too late!
- You'll have a lot of fun.</i>

454
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,920
I know you will!

455
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,240
All right, guys.

456
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,880
We've obviously gotten off
on the wrong foot here.

457
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,360
Now, you know and I know
that you really shouldn't be here.

458
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,320
So I'll tell you what.

459
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,200
Why don't you go ahead
and finish your meal...

460
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:07,480
and we can meet in my office and
start the process of crossing over.

461
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,480
What do you say?

462
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,560
Well, it's your hour.

463
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,240
Watch it!

464
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,560
Hey, Amber!
Wait up!

465
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,360
<i>Hey, you guys.</i>

466
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,040
Whoa!
Whoa!

467
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,400
Had that locker
last year.

468
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,040
Thanks.

469
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,120
My name's Vic.

470
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,440
Kat.

471
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,240
Coming, Vic?

472
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,560
<i>Okay, gang, let's settle down.</i>

473
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,080
Put a lid on it!
Ow!

474
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,840
Okay, I've got a couple
of announcements to make.

475
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,240
First,

476
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:31,240
the asbestos removal
from the gym is taking
longer than planned.

477
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:36,360
We're gonna have to push back
the Halloween dance
by a couple of months.

478
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,520
Well, as most of you know,
my parents have finished
the new boathouse.

479
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,360
So I'm sure it'd be no problem
having the party at my place.

480
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,680
<i>Great!</i>

481
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:54,680
That's done. Secondly,
we have a new student today.

482
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,880
I'd like you all to meet
Harvey Kathleen.

483
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,120
Would you like to come up
and say hi to everyone for me?

484
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:22,520
<i>So, why don't you tell us
something special about
yourself, Kathleen?</i>

485
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,680
Um, well, it's Kat.

486
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:30,560
And, um, I guess
I just moved here...

487
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,280
<i>with my dad
from Santa Fe.</i>

488
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:37,600
And Friendship seems
like a pretty friendly place.

489
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,000
<i>So where are you guys living?</i>

490
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,920
<i>In outer space?</i>

491
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,360
No. Whipstaff?

492
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,920
You've heard of it?

493
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,840
You actually live there?

494
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:01,440
<i>I know it looks kind of funky
and stuff from the outside.</i>

495
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:06,280
But, I mean, I don't know...
Inside it's kind of cool.

496
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,320
Well, yeah,
if you drink blood.

497
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:14,160
Mr. Curtis, check this.
We're dead for
the Halloween dance, right?

498
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:18,040
This girl has a seriously,
seriously creepy house
with room to spare.

499
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:23,240
I thought we were
having the party
at my place.

500
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,520
Oh? Okay,
we'll take a vote.

501
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:29,760
Whoever wants the party
at my house, raise your hand.

502
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,840
<i>Whipstaff?
Yeah!</i>

503
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,840
Oh!

504
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:42,200
Johns Hopkins University?
Very impressive.

505
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,160
<i>Very. Pull!</i>

506
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,720
<i>Pow!</i>

507
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,360
<i>Pull!</i>

508
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:56,040
Not... this one.
Thank you, gentlemen.

509
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:59,200
Hey, what a dish, Doc!
The little missus perhaps?

510
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,640
Hubba, hubba!

511
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:04,680
Fatso, you animal.
She available, Doc?

512
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:08,560
She's my wife Amelia.
She's deceased.
Even better.

513
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,840
But... we're not here
to talk about me.

514
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,560
See? Now don't
you feel just awful?
I was just goofin'.

515
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,840
Don't be goofin' on Amelia.
She's as nice a person
as they come.

516
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,960
<i>She's always treated you right,
huh, Stinkie?</i>

517
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,840
<i>I got no complaints.
She's always been
an angel to me.</i>

518
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,080
Wait a minute.
What are you saying?

519
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,240
<i>I'm sayin:
She's a peach.</i>

520
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:34,440
<i>None better. Why?
You've actually seen her?</i>

521
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,400
You think I'm blind?
Of course I've seen her.

522
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:40,440
Who hasn't?
You're not lookin' for her,
are ya, Doc?

523
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:45,680
Well, that's not really
the focus of our sessions
here, is it?

524
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,960
But as long as
you raised the issue,

525
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,440
you wouldn't have a way...

526
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:55,240
of contacting others
like yourselves, would you?

527
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,840
Hmm?

528
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:59,720
I didn't think so.

529
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,720
Now, that's not generally
allowed there, Doc.

530
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,120
<i>Ya gotta go
through channels.</i>

531
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,160
Paperwork.
Red tape.

532
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,840
A holy mess, you know?
But for you?

533
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,360
I don't know.
Maybe we could work
somethin' out.

534
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,200
You keep that ghoul
Crittenden off our backs,

535
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,160
and I'd say we got
a deal, right, boys?

536
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,520
Mm-hmm!

537
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:28,160
Deal?
Deal.

538
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,560
Fatso, you know
where Amelia floats.
Go!

539
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,920
It's that easy, huh?

540
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,960
We got a ghost-to-ghost
network.

541
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,600
We share haunting stories.
We throw parties.

542
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,840
The parties are always
pretty dead, though.

543
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,520
That was fast.

544
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:55,560
<i>I... I think
it's for you, Doc.</i>

545
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,400
Go.

546
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,440
Amelia?

547
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,720
My man!

548
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,120
Vic?

549
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:50,080
What are you do...
I mean, hi.

550
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,320
Can I come in?

551
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,480
Uh, no, no.

552
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:58,880
It's so much nicer
out here...

553
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,880
in the flesh...
fresh air.

554
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,840
So did ya ask your dad
about the party?

555
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:09,640
Y-Yeah, yeah. He, um,
kind of hit the ceiling,

556
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,040
but, um, I think
it's gonna be okay.

557
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:17,160
Cool. So, listen,
if you're not hooked up
with anybody else,

558
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:21,120
you wanna...
I don't know... hang out
with me at the party?

559
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,480
I'd love to.

560
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:28,200
All right, cool.
All right, see ya.

561
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,640
Okay.

562
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,680
Yes!

563
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,000
Well, did you ask her?
Yeah.

564
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:49,160
And she actually
believed you?

565
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:54,280
This really bites.
No, it's absolutely perfect.

566
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,920
Hey!

567
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,360
See? I'm a good dancer.
Whoa!

568
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,480
Don't need a costume.

569
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,520
I'm always the life
of the party.

570
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,640
Casper, listen.
I know you want to go.

571
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,640
Come on. We'd have
a great time together.

572
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,760
Casper, I have a date.

573
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:33,320
What's this Vic guy got
that I don't, huh?

574
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:37,880
A pulse?
Big fleshy deal.

575
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:40,800
A tan.
Very bad for your skin.

576
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,680
How about a reflection?

577
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:51,720
Okay, okay,
but can he do this?

578
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:57,440
Come with me if you want to live.

579
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:00,280
Casper?

580
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,200
Casper! No! Don't!

581
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:06,440
Casper, no!
Casper, no! No, no, no, no!

582
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,400
Casper, no. Oh, my God!
High! This is very high!

583
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:16,880
Casper! Casper!

584
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,680
Casper,
this is beautiful.

585
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:33,120
I come here every night.

586
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:37,240
Alone?
Mm-hmm.

587
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:41,080
What were you like
when you were alive?

588
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:45,880
I was... I was...

589
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,040
I don't remember.

590
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:52,040
You don't remember
anything from your life?

591
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,960
No.

592
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:56,720
So... Nothing?

593
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,760
No.

594
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:02,840
You don't remember
what school you went to,
how old you were?

595
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:05,520
Your favorite song?

596
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:11,000
What about your dad?
Hm-mmm.

597
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,440
Not even your mom?

598
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:17,160
Is that bad?
No.

599
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:20,000
It's just kind of sad.

600
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:30,920
I wonder why you
don't remember anything.

601
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:36,200
Hmm? Guess 'cause
when you're a ghost,

602
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:39,400
life doesn't matter
that much anymore.

603
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,600
So you forget.

604
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:47,200
Sometimes I worry
that I'm trying to forget.

605
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,360
Forget what?

606
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:53,800
My mom.
Just certain things.

607
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,920
The sound of her making
breakfast downstairs.

608
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,200
The way she put on
her lipstick...

609
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:04,520
so carefully.

610
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:10,320
I do remember...
she always used Ivory soap.

611
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,480
And when she'd hug me,
I'd breathe her in...

612
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,120
so deep.

613
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:20,000
And I remember,
before I'd go to sleep,

614
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:24,360
she'd whisper in my ear,
"Stardust in the eyes,

615
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:28,040
rosy cheeks and a happy girl
in the morning."

616
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,000
Casper?

617
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,320
Hmm?

618
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:43,000
If my mom's a ghost,
did she forget about me?

619
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:46,400
No, she'd
never forget you.

620
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:51,200
Kat?
Mm-hmm?

621
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:56,760
If I were alive, would you go to
the Halloween dance with me?

622
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,840
Mm-hmm.

623
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:01,480
Kat?
Hmm?

624
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:05,200
Can I keep you?
Mm-hmm.

625
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:12,360
Casper, close the window.
It's cold.

626
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:38,880
Hey, Dad!

627
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,320
Found your Visa card.

628
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,480
Where was it?
Um, in your wallet.

629
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:47,240
Maybe I could use it to buy
this perfect costume I saw
in a store downtown.

630
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,760
You always
made your costume.
No, Mom did.

631
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:55,600
I think I could come up
with something pretty good.

632
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:00,000
Why don't we roll you
in aluminum foil, and you
could go as a leftover?

633
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:06,560
Don't worry.
You always look cute.

634
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:10,600
I don't wanna look cute.
Cute's like when
you're nine years old...

635
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:14,000
and you've got papier-mache
around your head.

636
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:19,240
I want to look... nice.
Mm-hmm.

637
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,400
Like... Like date nice.

638
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:29,880
Really? Uh...

639
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:33,560
Honey, I think maybe
it's time that we...

640
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:36,680
<i>sat down and...
It's a little late
for that, Dad.</i>

641
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:42,280
- How late?
- Oh, don't worry.
Not that late.

642
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:45,600
Oh, good.

643
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:49,400
You know that I would love
to buy you everything you wanted.

644
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:53,400
But until Miss Crittenden
pays me, that thing
is pretty worthless.

645
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:57,280
Oh, well, that's okay.
Don't worry about it.

646
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:00,280
I'm sure I can come up
with something perfect
for the party.

647
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:03,800
<i># It's my party and
I'll die if I want to #</i>

648
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:07,560
<i># Die if I want to #</i>

649
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:10,920
Dad, please,
whatever you do,

650
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,960
don't let those guys
crash it.

651
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:18,320
Oh, no, I think they're actually
getting to be quite focused now.

652
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:24,200
<i># You will die too
when it happens to you #</i>

653
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:27,400
<i># Da, da, da-da, da, da #</i>

654
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:30,400
<i>Big finish!</i>

655
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,480
<i>Scream or sugar?</i>

656
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:51,720
<i>Vell, vell, ze patient
has finally arrived.</i>

657
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,760
Late again, I see.

658
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:56,840
Could this be an expression
of hostility, Doc?

659
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:01,800
<i>It's your hour, Freud.</i>

660
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:08,040
What? So silent?
No pearls of wisdom
today, Doc?

661
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:12,400
Come on, Doc.
Stay tough. Don't stop.

662
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15,040
Come on, Doc.
Hang with us homeboys.

663
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:17,840
Hey, wait a second.
What?

664
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,800
You ain't thinkin'
about packin' it in now,
are ya, Doc?

665
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,440
We were just startin'
to have fun.

666
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:27,880
It ain't often we meet
a bonebag as amusin' as you.

667
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:32,680
Boys, this is serious.
I think the doc is havin'
one of them fleshy breakdowns.

668
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:33,840
<i>Time for drastic measures.</i>

669
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:36,560
Think we should break
into a song?
No!

670
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:40,040
It's time we gave the doc
our own prescription.

671
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:43,120
What about the party?
The party will have to wait.

672
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:46,360
Are you thinkin'
what I'm thinkin'?
Gentlemen?

673
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:49,160
Happy hour!
Happy hour!
Happy hour.

674
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,400
Whoop...
Yee-haw!

675
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:53,440
<i># Ninety-nine bottles of beer
on the wall #</i>

676
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:57,160
<i># Ninety-nine bottles of beer #
Just the dead guys!</i>

677
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,680
This is an outrage.
This is appalling.

678
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,680
You pay a man to get
the ghosts out of the house,
and what does he do?

679
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,600
He gets the ghosts
out of the house.
Exactly.

680
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,640
It's about time.

681
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:30,720
Ohh!
Look familiar?

682
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,520
This is...

683
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,400
This is...

684
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:41,560
And...

685
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,880
I know this.

686
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,040
I had five fingers.

687
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:54,960
I remember!

688
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,080
Hootie!

689
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,400
<i>Chugga-chugga,
chugga-chugga.</i>

690
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:05,320
And wait!

691
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:14,280
Check it out.

692
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:16,200
<i>Hands up, Kat.</i>

693
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:27,480
Oh, wow.
It was my mom's.

694
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:32,200
Can I...
Go ahead.

695
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:46,560
Oh, Casper,
it's perfect.

696
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:49,640
You think I could wear it
to the party tonight?

697
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:52,960
Casper?

698
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,960
I begged and begged my dad
to get me this sled,

699
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:04,640
and he acted like
I couldn't even have it,

700
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:07,400
'cause I didn't know
how to ride it.

701
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,120
And then one morning,
I... I came down
for breakfast,

702
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,480
and there it was,
just for me.

703
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:14,480
For no reason at all.

704
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:19,880
I took it out,
went sledding all day,

705
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:22,600
and my dad said,
"That's enough",
but I couldn't stop.

706
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,640
I was having so much fun.

707
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,560
Then it got late.

708
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,440
It got dark.

709
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,360
Got cold.

710
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:36,360
And I got sick.
My dad got sad.

711
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:45,960
What's it like to die?

712
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:50,240
Like being born.

713
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:54,000
Only backwards.

714
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:57,760
I remember I didn't go
where I was supposed to go.

715
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,320
I just stayed behind...

716
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:02,520
so my dad
wouldn't be lonely.

717
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,720
<i>Is that your dad?
Mm-hmm.</i>

718
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:25,600
"McFadden claimed that he
was haunted by the ghost
of his dead son,

719
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:28,800
"and that he
invented a machine
to bring him back to life:

720
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,720
The Lazarus."
The Lazarus.

721
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:39,080
Ooh.

722
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:43,080
Hee-hee. Sorry.
I guess we'll have
to take the long way.

723
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:45,040
Hurry up!
Come on!

724
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:51,600
My dad hid it
so no one can find it,
but I remember where it is!

725
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,640
<i>Ha!
Wait'll you see it.</i>

726
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:06,840
- Don't you know a shortcut?
- You got it.

727
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:11,760
Casper, no!
Wall... human?

728
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,720
Stop!

729
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:22,480
<i>Hey! Over here.</i>

730
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:24,400
Go ahead.
Sit down.

731
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:29,840
I would hold on.
Why?

732
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:47,920
Casper!

733
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:16,280
Well?

734
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:18,920
What was that?
The "Up and At 'Em" machine.

735
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:22,920
My dad was a great inventor,
but he had a little trouble
getting going in the morning.

736
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,160
Didn't he ever hear
of caffeine?

737
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:34,400
Dibs!

738
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:38,400
Wha...

739
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:47,280
What is all this?

740
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:49,840
My dad's lab.
Kind of a slob,
wasn't he?

741
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:53,440
Down here, he could do
whatever he wanted to.
But no matter how busy he was,

742
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:56,360
he would drop everything
to play pirates with me.

743
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,760
<i>Man, we had
so much fun.</i>

744
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:03,280
Aye, matey.
Buccaneers and buried gold.
Whipstaff doth a treasure hold.

745
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:05,240
Oh!
Come on.

746
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:09,080
Dibs!
Oh!

747
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:12,760
<i>So where's this
Lazarus thing?
You're lookin'at it.</i>

748
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:16,520
Down there?
Huh. That's useful.

749
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:19,720
Oh, I know there's a way
to get it going.
I just can't...

750
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:22,600
What about that?
That?

751
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:24,760
Nah. That's the vault.

752
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:29,920
Wait!
It's gotta be this!

753
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:34,680
Hey, I did it!

754
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:56,800
Lazarus!

755
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:06,240
Ah. Ooh. Ouch.

756
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:27,440
What is this?
Careful!

757
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:29,800
That's what makes
the whole thing work.

758
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:32,440
Kind of an instant
primordial soup mix.

759
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:35,880
It's what brings ghosts
back to life.

760
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:39,080
Just enough for one.

761
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:54,760
- Pull the lever.
- Which one?

762
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:56,680
I don't know.
Try one.

763
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:11,360
- Casper?
- I'm gonna be alive.

764
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:23,120
Oh, man, how am I
gonna do this?

765
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:26,000
I couldn't even get
my Easy Bake oven to work.

766
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,080
Okay.

767
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:04,920
Casper?

768
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:20,160
Am I alive?

769
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:25,760
Dibs, do you have any idea
what this means?
Yes!

770
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:30,680
No.
You don't have to be scared
of death anymore.

771
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:33,120
One minute you'll be a ghost;
next, you're back on your feet,

772
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:35,480
free to come and go
as you please.

773
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:38,480
Hell, you could even
fly through...
Walls.

774
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:43,040
Thick walls.
Thick as steel.

775
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:46,760
Certainly could get to
whatever's behind those walls.

776
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:50,080
Like a, a treasure,
for example?
And snap, crackle, pop:

777
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:53,640
You're back alive
and on your way
to the Riviera.

778
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:56,520
If you were a ghost.

779
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:59,120
If you were.

780
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:04,440
<i>Damn it, Dibs.
This won't hurt a bit.</i>

781
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:08,800
<i>Stop being such a weenie!
It's just business.
Come on!</i>

782
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:11,440
If you would just...

783
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:15,360
Whoa.
Wa-a-a-a!

784
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:27,040
<i>So there you are.</i>

785
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:43,640
Dibs, you're takin' this
way too personally.

786
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:04,360
Carrigan!

787
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:08,760
Are you
a ghost yet?

788
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:12,320
Carrigan!

789
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:17,800
What a tragic waste.

790
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:19,840
She had my favorite sunglasses.

791
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:25,160
<i>Not so fast, little man.</i>

792
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:28,520
<i>The bitch is back.
Wha...</i>

793
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:36,960
# Warden threw a party
at the county jail #

794
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:39,640
# The prison band was there
They began to wail #

795
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:42,640
<i># The band played hard
The joint began to swing #</i>

796
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,800
# You should've heard
those knocked-out
jailbirds sing #

797
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:46,720
# Let's rock #

798
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:50,320
Hey, this Dr. Harvey's got
a lot of spirit, you know
what I'm sayin'?

799
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:53,760
Yeah, but he's got
his whole miserable
life ahead of him.

800
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:57,400
So we could do him a favor
and put him out of his misery.

801
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:59,600
Yeah. Hey,
good idea.

802
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:02,640
We been the ghostly trio
long enough.

803
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:06,520
Time to make it a...
quartet!

804
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:20,480
Could I just
say something here?

805
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:24,240
- And get a little personal?
- Oh, yeah.
You know how it is. Okay.

806
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:27,560
Well, I just
got to tell you...

807
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:33,640
you guys remind me
of what it's like to
hang out with the boys.

808
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:38,760
I mean, you are absolutely
there for each other.

809
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:41,520
<i># Falling in love... #</i>

810
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:44,080
I mean, you look life
right in the face.

811
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:47,400
You say, "I'm a ghost.
I don't need you. Mmm".

812
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:51,280
You know what? I'm gonna
tell that Miss Critten Picken...

813
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:55,640
Uh, Crichton Critten...
Crut...

814
01:10:55,720 --> 01:11:00,400
I'm gonna tell that lady
you aren't goin' anywhere.

815
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:03,560
It's your house.
You're haunting it.

816
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:05,840
Possession is
nine-tenths of the law.

817
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:07,760
No.
No.
No.
Yes.

818
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,840
No.
No.
No.
Yes.

819
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:14,120
Aww.
Aww.
I didn't think so
at first, but...

820
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:16,040
you guys are great.

821
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:19,560
I love you... guys.

822
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:23,040
Hey. Hey!

823
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:25,080
Eeow!

824
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:28,400
Eeeeee!
Ohh!

825
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:30,520
Hey.
Noooo.

826
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:35,280
Heh-heh.

827
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,200
Oof!

828
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:44,160
What a sweetheart.

829
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:47,760
I can't croak him now.

830
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:50,080
Me neither.
No way.

831
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:55,840
All right, boys!

832
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:58,080
The night is young.
Mm-hmm.

833
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:02,760
We are gonna clean out
every bar this town has got.

834
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:04,560
Uh-uh-uh.

835
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:07,000
We're gonna booze it
until we lose it.

836
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:08,920
Come on.
Come on.

837
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,320
<i>Whoop.</i>

838
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:24,040
Think my ears
just popped.

839
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:31,560
<i>Come to Mama.</i>

840
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:38,520
<i>- My treasure!
- You mean my treasure.</i>

841
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:41,640
Uhhh.
Miss Crittenden?

842
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:44,440
In the flesh.
Well, in a couple of minutes.

843
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:47,960
<i>Oh! Ah! Oh!</i>

844
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:53,120
Dibs! What are you doing?
This is no time to shave.

845
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:56,080
Helping you, remember?
Remember what?

846
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:58,000
This!

847
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:01,640
You stole that.
That's Casper's.

848
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:04,720
So sue me. Dibs!
The capsule! Now!

849
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:07,200
Coming.
I'm coming, okay?

850
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:15,960
<i>Keep away from me.</i>

851
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:22,400
Here. Jump in.

852
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:44,520
Oh!

853
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:46,440
Oy.
Perfect.

854
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:55,080
- We're here.
- Uh, okay.

855
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:57,840
Hi. Come on in.
This is the room.

856
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:01,280
Um, stay together;
you'll be safe.
And I'll be right back.

857
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:10,320
Amber, do we
have to do this?

858
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:15,280
Hey, she wants a Halloween party,
she's gonna get a Halloween party.

859
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:31,680
Hey, that's
my treasure!
Stay back!

860
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:33,640
Keep away from me.
Casper!

861
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:37,840
Don't come near me,
you spiteful spook, or I'll
knock you into the next world.

862
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:40,680
Come on.
Let's go.

863
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:51,600
# Ta-da #

864
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:54,560
<i>Hey, "poppin' fresh",
it's my turn in the oven.</i>

865
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:58,800
Dibs! Get this thing cooking,
you blasted little worm you!

866
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:05,080
Ah... Carrigan.
How kind of you to drop in.

867
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:07,320
<i>You know,</i>

868
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,800
if there's one thing I've
learned from you, it's:

869
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,840
Always kick 'em
when they're down.

870
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:17,120
And, baby,
you're six feet under.
Oh, what a shame.

871
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:21,880
Sorry, sweetheart.
We're through.

872
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:25,960
I am not gonna
forget this, you ungrateful,
lousy little worm you.

873
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,440
Oh, you can haunt me
all you want,

874
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:32,960
but it's gonna be
in a great big,
expensive house...

875
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:35,360
with lovely
purple wallpaper...

876
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:38,040
and great big
green carpets...

877
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:40,960
and a little dog
called Carrigan...

878
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,920
a bitch just like you.

879
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,800
I got the power.
I got the treasure.

880
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:49,840
And you have
a flight to catch.

881
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:55,560
Any other takers?

882
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:58,760
No. But aren't you
forgetting something?

883
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:00,920
What?

884
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,840
Your unfinished
business.

885
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:05,960
- My what?
- You know,

886
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:07,920
unfinished business.

887
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:12,320
All ghosts have unfinished business.
That's why they don't cross over.

888
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:16,040
Unfinished business?
I have no unfinished business.

889
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:20,160
I have my treasure, my mansion.
I have everything.

890
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:23,240
I'm just perfect.

891
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:26,840
<i>Wait! Wait!
I lied.</i>

892
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:29,440
I have unfinished business,
lots of unfinished business.

893
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:32,040
L-I'm not ready
to cross over yet.

894
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:34,920
Wait! You tricked me,
you rotten little brats!

895
01:16:56,920 --> 01:17:00,320
My treasure!
A ball?
That's your treasure?

896
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:05,160
Are you kidding? It's
autographed by Duke Snyder,
the Brooklyn Dodgers.

897
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:07,480
My favorite player.

898
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:10,120
Casper, it's time.

899
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:19,640
<i>Honey!
I'm home!</i>

900
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:23,000
Whoooaaa-ehhhh-whoo-ohhh!

901
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:27,200
Ooh.
Dad?

902
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:29,960
No! What have you
done to him?

903
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,320
Nothin'. He's just
a little... dead.

904
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:35,960
I'm free!
I've never felt
so good in my life.

905
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:39,440
I can fly-y-y-eee!

906
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,960
Rookie.
Stinkie,
work with him.

907
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:45,120
Dad?
Yeah.

908
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:48,400
Hey!
Who's the girl?
Dad, it's me.

909
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:52,200
L-It's Kat.
Kat. Kat?

910
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:54,440
- Kat Ballou.
- Katatonic.

911
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:57,160
Katastrophic.
Kreplach soup.

912
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:03,240
<i>Ohh.</i>

913
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:07,200
- Flesh flood alert.
- Dad?

914
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:09,120
Don't you remember?

915
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:14,360
Oh, yeah!
I remember!

916
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,560
No!

917
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:21,440
<i>No. No!
This.</i>

918
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:25,040
Oh.

919
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:27,960
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.

920
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:31,320
Oh, Kat!

921
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:34,520
Oh, sweetheart.

922
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:38,120
Oh, what have I done?
I... Oh, Kat.

923
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:41,600
Don't cry. I...
Oh, please.

924
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:45,800
Come on, Dr. Harvey.
You need this
more than I do.

925
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:51,560
Casper.

926
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:54,280
This is the way
it's gotta be.

927
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:24,520
Dad?
Oh, Kat!

928
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:27,240
Oh! Ohh, Kat.

929
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:29,960
Aww. Hey.

930
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:34,920
<i>Oh, honey.</i>

931
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:38,120
Oh, that felt like
the strangest dream.

932
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:44,960
I... I thought we
almost lost each other
for a minute there.

933
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,680
Oh, Bucket.

934
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:59,440
Your party started
without you.

935
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:05,160
Your date's
probably waiting.

936
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:08,040
Maybe we should
get going.

937
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:15,240
Uh...
where are we?

938
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:35,280
Well, go ahead.
What about you?

939
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:39,200
Hey, this is your party.
Go do your thing.

940
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:44,360
Go hang.
Or chill or kick it or
whatever you call it.

941
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:49,000
I think you got
a date out there.

942
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:51,400
Thanks, Dad.

943
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:58,120
I hope no one saw that.

944
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:09,640
Hold still!
I'm trying.
Could you weigh any more?

945
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:11,880
Just shut up and
get your head down.

946
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:17,600
Oh, my... Oh,
you gotta see this.

947
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:19,960
People are gonna freak.

948
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:21,880
Let me see.

949
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:25,480
Cool.

950
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:28,200
Thank you.

951
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:47,120
Yeah!

952
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:38,320
You're...
Uh-huh.

953
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:41,960
You're...
That's right.

954
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:46,080
Kat's mom?

955
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:48,000
Are... Are you
an angel?

956
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:52,840
That was a very noble thing
you did tonight, Casper.

957
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:57,480
I know Kat
will never forget it.
She needs her father.

958
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:00,840
And I know yours
will never forget it either.

959
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:03,520
You fulfilled
his greatest dream, Casper,

960
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:06,640
and I know he is
very, very proud of you.

961
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:11,200
And for what you've done,
I'm giving you your dream
in return.

962
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:15,000
<i>But it's just for tonight.</i>

963
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,880
Sort of a Cinderella deal.

964
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:21,040
- So I have
until midnight?
- 10:00.

965
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:23,680
Hey, Cinderella
got until midnight.

966
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:27,280
Cinderella wasn't 12 years old.

967
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:43,040
<i># Every now and then #</i>

968
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:46,960
<i># We find a special friend #</i>

969
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:52,200
<i># Who never lets us down #</i>

970
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:58,400
<i># Who understands it all #</i>

971
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:02,240
<i># Reaches out
each time we fall #</i>

972
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:06,320
<i># You're the best friend
that I've found #</i>

973
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:14,040
<i># I know you can't stay #</i>

974
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:19,920
<i># But part of you
will never, ever go away #</i>

975
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:25,920
<i># Your heart will stay #</i>

976
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:31,560
<i># I'll make a wish for you #</i>

977
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:35,120
<i># And hope it will come true #</i>

978
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:38,960
<i># That life
will just be kind #</i>

979
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:43,040
<i># To such a gentle mind #</i>

980
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:46,880
<i># If you lose your way #</i>

981
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:49,680
<i># Think back on yesterday #</i>

982
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:55,400
<i># Remember me this way #</i>

983
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:58,400
<i># Ooh-ooh #</i>

984
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:01,440
<i># Remember me #</i>

985
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:05,760
<i># This way #</i>

986
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:15,560
I told you
I was a good dancer.

987
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:18,560
Can I keep you?

988
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:25,920
Casper?

989
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:06,720
Hello, James.

990
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:12,280
Amelia.

991
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:15,080
It's all right.

992
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,840
It's just me.

993
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,840
I...

994
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:27,280
I thought I'd have
a hundred things
to say when I...

995
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:32,280
How?

996
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:36,400
Let's just say you know
three crazy ghosts
who kept their word.

997
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:41,960
James, I know you've
been searching for me.

998
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:45,240
But there's something
you have to understand.

999
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:48,120
You and Kat loved me
so well when I was alive...

1000
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:50,800
that I have no
unfinished business.

1001
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,880
Please don't
let me be yours.

1002
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:54,800
But, Amelia,

1003
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:00,160
I don't...

1004
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:02,920
I don't really know
what I'm doing.

1005
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:06,160
What parent does?

1006
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:10,480
James, Kat is
growing up beautifully
because of you.

1007
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:15,560
No wonder
I miss you so much.

1008
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,240
Just a couple things,
though.

1009
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:23,440
Don't pick up the extension
every time she gets a phone call.

1010
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:26,520
French fries
are not a breakfast food.

1011
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:28,920
And don't ask her
to wear a T-shirt...

1012
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:32,120
under her...
Ah, under her bathing suit.

1013
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:35,360
I know.
Our daughter is...

1014
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:37,280
A teenager.
A teenager.

1015
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:05,520
Wait.

1016
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:08,000
Where are you going?

1017
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:10,160
Where I can watch over
both of you...

1018
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:12,200
until we're
together again.

1019
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:19,080
Good-bye, James.

1020
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,840
Casper?

1021
01:28:57,960 --> 01:28:59,840
Uh, ha. Boo?

1022
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:21,920
Not bad for
my first party, huh?

1023
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:24,040
Couldn't have
been better.

1024
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:27,040
It ain't over yet.
Boys!
