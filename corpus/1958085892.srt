with bears, obviously,

Uh, nothing was
really happening.

00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:53,539
And, finally, I just
lay down on the couch,

164
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,577
and I listened to the album.

165
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:01,047
Then it hit me.

00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,982
It's the coolest picture.

how it seemed to--

168
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,853
to capture the music.

169
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,422
On the surface, the songs are
really harsh and abrasive.

170
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,357
But--

171
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:15,294
--there's a calm center to
them, kind of a stillness.

172
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:24,570
Well, that's what
I got out of it.

really put you on the spot.

00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:27,433
Oh, yeah.

190
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:31,504
Yeah, the light, it's hypnotic.

191
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:38,444
Yeah, I'm, uh--

192
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:41,380
I got this thing
about the light.

193
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,151
I don't know, it's what draws
me in when I take a picture.

194
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:49,255
It's the light, the energy.

195
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,857
Well, it's wonderful.

196
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,060
Thanks.

197
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,329
Um, as I was saying, your
mom, she put you on the spot

198
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,630
down there.

199
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,398
And I'm sure you have better
things to do than to help

200
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:00,499
me pack boxes, so--

201
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,601
No, no, I'd--

202
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:02,535
I'd be happy to.

203
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:03,502
Really?

204
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,037
Absolutely.

205
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,074
Well, good.

206
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,409
I could use the help.

207
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:12,445
So call me when you've
got a free afternoon.

208
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:13,512
All right.

209
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,513
Good night.

210
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:22,855
[somber music]

211
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,643
I need a drink.

212
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:44,644
I got it covered.

213
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:49,482
Good girl.

214
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:55,888
Oh, good, nice.
- OK.

215
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:56,789
Smooth.

216
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:57,690
Very smooth.

217
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,591
Very smooth.

218
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:00,793
[chuckling]

219
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:02,328
It's a good thing
I'm not driving.

220
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:03,829
Now I know why you
live in New York.

221
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:07,233
[laughter]

222
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:13,506
As I recall, you're the
one who taught me to drive.

223
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:14,407
Yeah?

224
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,307
Mm-hmm.

225
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:17,209
So who is this Robert?

226
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:18,878
You come with me.

227
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:20,046
So?

228
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:23,249
Well, familiarity
always breeds contempt.

229
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,884
Was he a client?

230
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,652
Huh, worse.

231
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:27,553
A priest?

232
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:29,255
[laughter]

233
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,057
We're sick.

234
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:32,358
Married.

235
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:33,259
Oh, Nina.

236
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,527
With a couple of kids.

237
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:35,528
Oh.

238
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:41,167
Did you find out after?

239
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:45,438
No, I knew before,
but he was separated.

240
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,306
[sighs] I know it's
just a matter of time,

241
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:48,541
though, before he's
going to go back.

242
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:49,775
He's crazy about his kids.

243
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,610
Anyway, I broke it off, and--

244
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,749
I know, why do I
do this to myself?

245
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:58,884
No, why?

246
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:02,421
Your father abandoned you,
your mother was a recluse.

247
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:06,158
It's a wonder you're not
more screwed up than you are.

248
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:09,662
[laughter]

249
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:11,931
Well, I guess I have
you to thank for that.

250
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:12,832
Me?

251
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:15,568
[uplifting music]

252
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:18,137
Yeah, you.

253
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,339
You've always been my rock.

254
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:22,742
My surrogate, big sister.

255
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,814
Oh, Abby, I'm so
sick of New York.

256
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,916
When I come here, I see
how you and Dennis live.

257
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:32,184
You're a perfect family.

258
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:33,185
Not.

259
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:38,390
I envy you.

260
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,025
Oh, come on, you
have a great life.

261
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:41,393
You have a dream career.

262
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:43,929
You-- you travel.

263
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:45,965
My last vacation was
a builder's convention

264
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:47,266
in Reno two years ago.

265
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:49,101
(CHUCKLING) Oh, Reno?

266
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:50,102
Yeah, Reno.

267
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:52,638
[chuckles] Oh!

268
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:55,341
Yeah, you're right,
I've made my choices.

269
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,244
And they've been good ones.

270
00:12:58,344 --> 00:12:59,345
Most of them.

271
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:02,715
But sometimes it gets lonely.

272
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:04,283
Well, that's one
thing about having kids,

273
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,252
you don't get lonely.

274
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:09,255
Well, I don't really think
kids are in my blueprint.

275
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:14,927
Do you ever think
about leaving New York?

276
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:17,429
All the time.

277
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,697
I've got a good reputation.

278
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:22,501
I could probably live
anywhere if I stay freelance.

279
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:23,869
If?

280
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:28,474
Yeah, the security
of a firm is tempting.

281
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,943
Actually, there's a
firm in San Francisco

282
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:32,978
that I've been talking to,
and they made me an offer.

283
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:34,380
Yeah?
You might take it?

284
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,548
I don't know.

285
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,216
I'm going to go meet
with them while I'm here.

286
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:40,953
All right.

287
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:44,590
[sighs]
[school bell ringing]

288
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,192
STUDENT 1: All right,
I'll see you in 10.

289
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:47,860
STUDENT 2: Gabby, wait up!

290
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,728
No, I promised one
of my mom's friends

291
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,497
I'd help her pack up some stuff.

292
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:53,199
[scoffs] A friend of your mom?

293
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:54,200
She's really cool.

294
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,134
She's a graphic designer.

295
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:57,069
She used to live in New York.

296
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,171
And she does like CD
covers and stuff like that.

297
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:01,874
You know that Cage Bears,
"Hibernation" album?

298
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:02,775
Yeah.

299
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,476
She did that album.

300
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:05,377
Get out of here.

301
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:07,313
I swear.

302
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:08,781
Bet she gets a--

303
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:11,417
a lot of free CDs, you know
promos, stuff like that?

304
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,484
Uh--

305
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:15,788
Or maybe she can cut
us in on it a deal.

306
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,223
Think about it.

307
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:18,224
See you later, Gulliver.

308
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:24,363
Paul.

309
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:25,331
Hey, Mr. Franks.

310
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:26,232
Glad I ran into you.

311
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:27,266
You got a minute?

312
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,534
Yeah, sure.

313
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:30,502
Did St. Hope send you next
year's course catalog yet?

314
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:31,837
Yeah, I think so.

315
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:32,938
All right.

316
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,406
I know you're
going premed, but--

317
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:37,643
Uh, Mr. Franks,
actually I haven't, um,

318
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:38,777
made up my mind yet.

319
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,145
I thought you were
pre-med all the way.

320
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:42,114
Here grab a seat.

321
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,049
I mean about Stanhope.

322
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:45,284
Really?

323
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,886
I thought, you know, with
your early acceptance

324
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:47,786
and everything.

325
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,055
Have you applied somewhere else?

326
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:52,324
No, I'm just--

327
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:56,695
I'm not real sure
about, uh, college.

328
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:58,397
I mean, right now.

329
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:00,532
I was thinking of maybe
taking a year off.

330
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:03,736
And do what?

331
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:04,737
I don't know.

332
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:08,641
I've just been
spending so much time

333
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,810
thinking about college and
Stanhope and Paul Hewitt, M.D.

334
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:12,811
I--

335
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:17,549
I'm just not sure if
it's what I want anymore.

336
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,918
Did you talk to your
parents about this?

337
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,186
[chuckles] Yeah.

338
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,124
They didn't really understand.

339
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:26,025
They were pretty upset.

340
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,293
I bet they are.

341
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:30,229
Well, you going to Stanhope's
always been their dream.

342
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:32,097
Look, Paul, you're a smart kid.

343
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:33,966
You're going to land on your
feet no matter what you do,

344
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:37,469
but I hope you give this
some serious thought.

345
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:38,537
Stanhope's a good school.

346
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:39,972
My mom called you, didn't she?

347
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:45,744
Yeah, she did.

348
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,413
You always told me
to make up my own mind,

349
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:48,914
and this is my decision.

350
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:51,750
And I want you to
make the right decision.

351
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,385
Look, I'm sorry you
and dad had to drop

352
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:54,720
out of college, all right?

353
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,988
But if I go, I'm going to go--

354
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,256
If?

355
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:59,191
Can I finish?

356
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,193
If I go, I'm going to
go because I want to go,

357
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,628
not because you want me to.

358
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:04,430
[sighs] Is that
what this is about?

359
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,165
You don't want to go
because it's what we want?

360
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:09,501
[sighs] No, that's
not what this is about.

361
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:10,402
I'm late.

362
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,871
I got to go.

363
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:13,839
[sighs]

364
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:17,343
[phone ringing]

365
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,082
Hello?

366
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,751
ROBERT (ON PHONE):
Hello, Nina, is that you?

367
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:26,852
Robert.

368
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:27,886
How did you get this number?

369
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:34,927
ROBERT (ON PHONE): Listen,
Nina, I have some good news.

370
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,161
I've been doing a
lot of thinking.

371
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:37,696
I've come to a decision.

372
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:39,398
You made a
decision, well, good.

373
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:45,304
But I told you, Robert, I don't
want to talk to you about this

374
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:46,338
anymore.

375
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:47,473
ROBERT (ON PHONE):
I filed for divorce.

376
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:50,409
I served Caroline with
the papers yesterday.

377
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,677
You what?

378
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:53,212
ROBERT (ON PHONE): I'm
sorry it took me so long

379
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:54,380
to come to my senses, Nina.

380
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,115
But now we can be
together like we planned.

381
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:57,016
That is insane.

382
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:58,250
I never said any--

383
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,185
[dramatic music]

384
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:01,086
[knocking]

385
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,154
I never said such a thing.

386
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:03,255
ROBERT (ON PHONE):
For 10 months,

387
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,289
it's all we talked about.

388
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,858
Now that I've done
it, don't back away.

389
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:06,992
Don't lose your trust in me.

390
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:08,694
I can't talk about
this right now.

391
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:11,330
And it's not a matter
of distrusting you.

392
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,398
I just don't want this anymore.

393
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:13,699
ROBERT (ON PHONE):
How can you say that?

394
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,534
Come on, Nina, you've always
been afraid of commitment.

395
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:16,902
I know it's scary,
but you've got to try.

396
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:18,737
I am not scared, Robert.

397
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:19,638
I'm not.

398
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:21,106
It's over.

399
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,007
All right?

400
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:23,042
It's over!

401
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:24,143
ROBERT (ON PHONE):
It's not over.

402
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:25,444
You know it is.

403
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,845
And if I were there right
now holding you in my arms,

404
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:27,980
you wouldn't be saying that.

405
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:28,981
I love you, Nina.

406
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,049
I want us to be together.

407
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,550
I want to spend the rest
of my life with you,

408
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,385
and that's what you want, too.

409
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:34,319
Well, that's just too bad.

410
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,988
That's just too damn bad.

411
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:49,735
Are you OK?

412
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:53,305
[sobs]

413
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:06,985
I'm sorry.

414
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,087
That's OK.

415
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,761
I should get dressed.

416
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:28,640
[dance music]

417
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,330
Oh, man!

418
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,231
What?

419
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:54,399
This can't be my mom.

420
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,135
Oh, god.

421
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:57,035
Oh, god.

422
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,005
[chuckles] Yeah,
the disco years.

423
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:01,707
[chuckles] That is wild.

424
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,510
Yeah, she was wild.

425
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,845
Get out of here, really?

426
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:09,715
No, she was actually
pretty straight.

427
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,483
Boy, she knew where
she was headed

428
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,018
and why she wanted even then.

429
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:15,854
Yeah, only she never got it.

430
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:19,091
[sensual music]

431
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:21,960
No, but I guess that
sometimes knowing what you want

432
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,196
isn't always enough.

433
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:25,531
I don't know.

434
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:28,734
I kind of think it's dangerous
to know what you want.

435
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:32,204
I think it can cut you
off from other things.

436
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:33,472
That's true.

437
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:35,574
Life doesn't always move
in a straight progression.

438
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,910
And sometimes, no matter
how much you plan,

439
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,245
it doesn't turn out
like you pictured it.

440
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,947
Well, that's fine, as
long as you're open to that

441
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:44,249
and not afraid of it.

442
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:47,719
Yeah, got to
listen to the muse.

443
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:49,655
The what?

444
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:52,257
Muse.

445
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,960
Oh, I call mine Crazy Annie.

446
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,895
Um, inspiration.

447
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:58,597
The voice in your
head that tells you

448
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,199
that things are getting
cozy and predictable,

449
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,501
and you got to shake
it up because boredom

450
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,603
is the eighth deadly sin.

451
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:08,840
[chuckles] So when that
voice starts to scream,

452
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:09,908
I've got to listen to it.

453
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:11,276
I've got to do something
fast because if I

454
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,344
don't, I'm going to go crazy.

455
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:16,515
And it is not going to shut up.

456
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:18,250
Well, I definitely
got one of those.

457
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,120
Good.

458
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,189
Listen to it.

459
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:25,857
It'll take you to
amazing places.

460
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:36,969
Hey.

461
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,737
Hey.

462
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:42,341
I came by to see you,
and I got a free dinner.

463
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:43,242
Sorry.

464
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:44,943
I was, uh--

465
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:46,245
I know.

466
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:49,481
You were helping your mom's
friend pack up some stuff.

467
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,083
You're such a sweetheart.

468
00:20:56,521 --> 00:21:00,759
Um, Paul, I was talking
to your mom and dad.

469
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:05,564
And this whole thing about not
wanting to go away for school,

470
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:07,099
is it because of me?

471
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:11,937
What do you mean?

472
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:15,107
Are you worried about us
being so far apart next year?

473
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:16,008
No.

474
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:19,611
No, I'm not worried about that.

475
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:23,081
I mean, even if you
do stay here next year,

476
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:25,550
I'm going to be at
UCLA, so we probably

477
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:27,152
wouldn't see each any
more often than we

478
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:28,820
would if you were at Stanhope.

479
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:35,427
What if I came
to UCLA with you?

480
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:36,361
What?

481
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,030
You mean, like, go
to school there?

482
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:42,200
No, I mean come live there
in your dorm or whatever.

483
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,502
Living together?

484
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:44,770
What do you--

485
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,271
I-- I've always thought
about a career in photography.

486
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:48,407
I mean, I've got
tons of great stuff.

487
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:51,276
I can just throw together a
portfolio and make the rounds.

488
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:52,244
Sounds great, I guess.

489
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:53,245
I mean--

490
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:55,881
And there's tons
of opportunity in LA.

491
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,849
But, sure, I'd have to be an
apprentice for a little while,

492
00:21:57,949 --> 00:22:00,919
but it's no big deal.

493
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:03,088
You're serious.

494
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:05,090
Sure.

495
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,426
Just blow off med school?

496
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:10,028
Just like that?

497
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:11,530
Maybe.

498
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:12,864
I don't know.

499
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:17,736
I-- I just have this gut feeling
that once I start pre-med,

500
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:21,973
I'll, uh, just
never get out of it.

501
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:23,275
But that's what you wanted.

502
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,647
Is it?

503
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:29,648
Yeah.

504
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:39,758
[sighs] Look, Paul, whatever
you want to do is fine with me.

505
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,860
You know that.

506
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,430
[serene music]

507
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:47,899
Come here.

[knocking]

509
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:28,740
Paul?

510
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:49,895
Paul.

511
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:50,896
Paul?

[uplifting music]

513
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,838
Since your mother
doesn't have a headstone,

514
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:34,673
I thought you might like this.

515
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:37,642
Paul.

516
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,450
ABBY: Having you around
like this is a lot more fun

517
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,819
than just talking on
the phone twice a year.

518
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:48,820

519

520
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:51,356
Mm, this one, you think?

521
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,324
Yeah.

522
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:59,664
Abby, did you know about
the picture that Paul gave me?

523
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:01,099
Oh, yeah, I did see that.

524
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:02,701
That was so sweet.

525
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:04,369
He is such a great kid.

526
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:06,938
I think so.

527
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:09,007
I am worried about him, though.

528
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:10,208
NINA: Why?

529
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:12,577
Oh, he's scheduled to
go to Stanhope next fall.

530
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:15,847
And now he's thinking
of not going.

531
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:17,082
Really?

532
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,384
Why?

533
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:20,285
I don't know.

534
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:23,121
Huh.

535
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:24,389
I hate you.

536
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:28,426
[giggles] Then I'm buying it.

537
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,462
Why don't you and Dennis
take him to the campus

538
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:31,363
and show him around?

539
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:34,266
We offered, he's
not interested.

540
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,166
That's too bad.

541
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:37,602
It's such a great place.

542
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:42,007
Uh, I just had a crazy idea.

543
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:43,808
What?

544
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:45,744
Oh, no, forget it.

545
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:47,946
What?

546
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,514
What if Paul went with
you when you go to San

547
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:50,448
Francisco for your meeting?

548
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:51,550
What if you showed
him the campus?

549
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,184
Oh, gee, I don't
know if he'll--

550
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:54,553
We would pay all
of his expenses.

551
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:56,288
And I-- I don't want to
impose, but he likes you.

552
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,756
No, it's not an imposition.

553
00:25:57,856 --> 00:26:00,625
You know, you two seem
to speak the same language.

554
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,761
God knows he and I haven't
been communicating lately.

555
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:08,500
Well, I suppose I
could say an extra day.

556
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,770
Is this a dumb idea?

557
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:14,105
No.

558
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:17,442
No, it's a great idea.

She's going up Friday.

And she's coming back Sunday.

Mm-hmm.

562
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:23,648
Look, I know you
haven't made up your mind,

563
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,450
and we're OK with that.

564
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,785
Good.

565
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:30,522
We're just saying go, check
it out, see what you think.

You guys sound just like
Mr. Franks, you know that?

567
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:34,125
I'll go.

568
00:26:34,225 --> 00:26:36,294
Go where?

569
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:37,462
What's up?

570
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:39,397
Paul's going to San
Francisco with Nina.

571
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:41,132
ELLA: San Francisco?

572
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:43,201
I'm just going to
check out the campus.

573
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:44,970
Oh, I am so jealous.

00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:45,870
DENNIS: Ella.

575
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:46,771
Great.

576
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:48,239
Now I want to go even more.

Welcome, ma'am.

Hey.

Oh, it's great.

00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:56,741
Good.

Now come check this out.

Oh, look at this.

00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:06,785
Champagne, pistachios, pate.

599
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:08,286
Where's the chocolate?

600
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:10,622
Oh, no.

601
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:12,223
No chocolate.

602
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:13,692
Now they have to do
better than that if they

00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:15,694

looked at this, this morning.

00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,321
I was very surprised.

It seems to be a
little different.

655

I mean, but you authorized it?

The round corners soften it.

659
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,299
You can't authorize
blueprint alterations.

660

It's not going to
cost you another penny.

Dennis, that's not the point.

That's my vision you're
screwing with out there.

the one thing that I regret

was I didn't spend enough

learn about yourself and people

00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:27,585
Thanks.

736
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:39,497
- Great.
- You got it?

737
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:40,364
Yeah.

738
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:41,966
[chuckles]

739
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:53,644
There's some soda in the
refrigerator if you'd like one?

740
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:57,915
No, thanks.

741
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:03,387
[sensual music]

742
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:05,556
Uh, maybe some dinner?

743
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:09,594
No.

744
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:13,864
Actually, uh--

745
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,243
I'd rather just
stay here with you.

746
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:31,916
Paul, no.

747
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:32,917
Oh.

748
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:40,391
[moans] Don't.

749
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:07,285
[moans]

750
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:05,142
Hey.

751
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:07,978
Hi.

752
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,514
PAUL: What time is it?

753
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:13,050
It's early.

754
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,485
Why don't you
come back to bed?

755
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:21,158
[serene music]

756
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,408
You're so beautiful.

757
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:40,511
Don't.

758
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:44,281
Just hold me.

759
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:11,976
ANNOUNCER (ON INTERCOM):
Chris Skycapp,

760
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:15,413
please respond to
agent at gate 12.

761
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:17,515
Hi, welcome home.

762
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:19,016
Mm.

763
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:19,917
Hey.

764
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:21,352
Hi.

765
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:23,287
Missed you too.

766
00:40:23,387 --> 00:40:24,822
- Oh, let me get your bags.
- Oh, no.

767
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,223
No, I got it.
I got it.

768
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:27,858
Give you break.
How was the flight?

769
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:28,759
- What did I bring you?
- Great.

770
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:30,628
That's all they had to ask me.

771
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:34,365
Here we go.

772
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:36,534
Very cool.

773
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:37,535
I got a hat.

774
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:42,273
ABBY: Oh, a chocolate, great.

775
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:43,374
Thank you.

776
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,220
Oh, you're awake.

777
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,355
Cindy called.

778
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,891
But you're not going anywhere
until you tell me everything.

779
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:02,927
DENNIS: Ella, give
me that platter?

780
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:03,828
What?

781
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:06,197
About Stanhope.

782
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:09,834
Oh, um, I liked it.

783
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:19,844
But, yesterday, you sounded
pretty fired up about it.

784
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:20,845
Did I?

785
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,117
[school bell ringing]

786
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:28,319
I called you last night.

787
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:30,020
Didn't you get my message?

788
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,355
No, sorry.

789
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:33,991
So how was your trip?

790
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:36,660
It was good.

791
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,696
Are you OK?

792
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:41,265
Yes, I'm fine.

793
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:44,134
Well, my parents are going
to some benefits thing,

794
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:46,337
so can you come over?

795
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:47,238
Sure.

796
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,172
Great.

797
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:50,508
I'll see you later.

798
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:52,443
I don't know if he's
going to be accepted or not.

799
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,712
Hi, Cindy.

800
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:56,046
Bye, Cindy.

801
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:58,482
Oh, how was Frisco, big guy?

802
00:41:58,582 --> 00:42:00,484
It was cool.

803
00:42:00,584 --> 00:42:02,386
Did you check out the
strip clubs in North Beach

804
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:03,854
like I told you to?

805
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:06,423
No, man, I missed them.

806
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:09,493
Oh, man, you visit Sin
City and you act like a monk.

807
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:10,661
What's wrong with you?

808
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:13,697
Nothing.

809
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:18,502
ABBY: But I thought
the meeting went well.

810
00:42:18,602 --> 00:42:20,237
It did, I'm just not
ready to leave New York.

811
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:25,276
So when are you going back?

812
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,277
Soon.

813
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,979
Oh, that's too bad.

814
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:31,448
I got us tickets to the
Long Beach Jazz Festival.

815
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,217
And I was arranging
a dinner party and--

816
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:35,986
Without asking me?

817
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:39,323
I just assumed that you--

818
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:43,661
Well, I am sorry if
I messed up your plans.

819
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:51,769
So tell me about Stanhope.

820
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:53,470
You think Paul liked it?

821
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:56,273
Uh, yeah, I think he did.

822
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:57,274
ABBY: I can't tell.

823
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:02,246
He is real hard to
read these days.

824
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:05,916
NINA: Well, you know, I--

825
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:09,153
I think that he
did like it, but--

826
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,154
What?

827
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:15,159
I think he's losing
interest in being a doctor.

828
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:16,360
He told you that?

829
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,227
No.

830
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:19,663
It's a feeling that I have.

831
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:22,399
He's a really good photographer.

832
00:43:22,499 --> 00:43:25,302
What does that have
to do with anything?

833
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:27,071
That's where his heart is.

834
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:30,541
No, it's just a hobby.

835
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:33,110
[scoffs] Yeah, and hobbies
can lead to great careers.

836
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:34,645
Look where my doodling took me.

837
00:43:34,745 --> 00:43:36,547
Paul could be a really
fine photographer.

838
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:38,449
He could do anything he
set his mind to, but--

839
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:41,185
Then why not let him?

840
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:44,888
I think I know what's
best for Paul, Nina.

841
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:46,657
Maybe not.

842
00:43:46,757 --> 00:43:51,328
Sometimes a parent, who is
so involved in the situation,

843
00:43:51,428 --> 00:43:53,897
can't always tell what's
best for the child.

844
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:54,898
How would you know?

845
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,122
Did Nina say why?

846
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:21,792
She wants to get
back to New York.

847
00:44:21,892 --> 00:44:22,826
When does she go?

848
00:44:22,926 --> 00:44:25,062
Couple of days.

849
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:27,765
DENNIS: Well, I guess she
couldn't stay forever.

850
00:44:27,865 --> 00:44:29,199
Can I be excused?

851
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:30,501
Are you going out?

852
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:33,103
I'm just going to go
to Cindy's and study.

853
00:44:33,203 --> 00:44:35,172
Hey, are you all right?

854
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:37,441
Yeah, I'm fine.

855
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:38,442
- Say hi to Cindy.
- So long.

856
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:39,443
PAUL: See you.

857
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:45,249
ABBY: Weird.

858
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:48,819
[rock music]

859
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:57,861
So what should we study first?

860
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:09,673
What?

861
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:11,175
[sighs] What?

862
00:45:11,275 --> 00:45:12,943
You just don't
seem very interested.

863
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,214
No, I-- I don't know.

864
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:18,315
Paul, what's wrong?

865
00:45:22,586 --> 00:45:23,387
I got to go.

866
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:25,155
W-- wait.

867
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:26,156
You just got here.

868
00:45:26,256 --> 00:45:27,357
Yes, I'll call
you tomorrow, OK?

869
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:28,258
Where are you--

870
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:29,426
I'll call you tomorrow.

871
00:45:29,526 --> 00:45:30,327
Wait a second.

872
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:31,595
Can you wait?

873
00:45:31,695 --> 00:45:32,596
Paul?

874
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:48,078
[knocking]

875
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:05,763
You shouldn't have come here.

876
00:46:05,863 --> 00:46:08,732
Why are you leaving?

877
00:46:08,832 --> 00:46:10,033
I want you to go home.

878
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:11,335
No.

879
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,771
Look, Paul what happened
was great, but we cannot--

880
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:17,341
[sensual music]

881
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:16,493
[suspenseful music]

882
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:31,341
PAUL: Wait.

883
00:48:31,441 --> 00:48:34,444
Give me a second.

884
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:35,345
Stop it.

885
00:48:35,445 --> 00:48:36,613
We're going to get in trouble.

886
00:48:36,713 --> 00:48:38,215
[hushed whispering]

887
00:48:39,216 --> 00:48:40,050
Oh, you're driving me crazy.

888
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:43,520
[laughs]

889
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:46,323
Abby.

890
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:47,324
Mom.

891
00:48:50,394 --> 00:48:51,194
Mom.

892
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:52,329
- Go home, Paul.
- Mom.

893
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:53,297
ABBY: I'll talk to you later.

894
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:54,264
Now!

895
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:01,071
I'll wait for you downstairs.

896
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:04,975
Oh, god.

897
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:16,853
I'm so sorry.

898
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:17,854
You bitch!

899
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:22,492
I didn't mean
for this to happen.

900
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:23,593
It just did.
- No, don't!

901
00:49:23,694 --> 00:49:25,729
Don't you dare try to
explain this to me.

902
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:27,130
I should have you arrested.

903
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:30,200
And if you see Paul again, if
you talk to him again, I will.

904
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,535
I swear to God, I will.

905
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:32,669
That's right.

906
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:34,304
There's only one side of
the story, Abby's side.

907
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:36,139
You don't even
know why he was here.

908
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:37,407
Get out of my way!

909
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:41,745
[sighs]

910
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:44,247
Is Paul upstairs?

911
00:49:44,348 --> 00:49:45,349
Yes, he's in his room.

912
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:47,417
He stormed in a little while--

913
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:49,186
Abby, what's going on?

914
00:49:49,286 --> 00:49:50,253
Abby!

915
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:52,622
[knocking]

916
00:49:52,723 --> 00:49:53,623
Come in.

917
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:03,133
This isn't your fault. Nina
is a very seductive woman.

918
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:09,206
She didn't seduce me, mom.

919
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:10,640
I've known her most
of my life, Paul.

920
00:50:10,741 --> 00:50:13,877
I know how she operates.

921
00:50:13,977 --> 00:50:15,078
Nina and I like each other.

922
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:17,247
We like spending time together.

923
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:18,348
What's wrong with that?

924
00:50:18,448 --> 00:50:20,250
Everything is wrong with that.

925
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:21,284
I don't think so.

926
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:26,156
You can't stop me
from seeing her.

927
00:50:26,256 --> 00:50:28,992
As long as you're living in
this house, I can, and I will.

928
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:34,664
What the hell is going on?

929
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:35,565
Where's Ella?

930
00:50:35,665 --> 00:50:36,900
DENNIS: What?

931
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,301
She's down in the
den watching TV.

932
00:50:38,402 --> 00:50:40,270
What's going on?

933
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:41,738
ABBY: Paul's sleeping with Nina.

934
00:50:44,274 --> 00:50:45,108
What?

935
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:48,278
He was just over
there tonight.

936
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:49,279
Oh, for god's sake.

937
00:50:52,149 --> 00:50:53,917
I think we should
call the police.

938
00:50:54,017 --> 00:50:55,118
The police?

939
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:56,319
He's just a boy, Dennis.

940
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:57,521
It's statutory rape.

941
00:50:57,621 --> 00:50:59,389
DENNIS: Abby, he's 18 years old.

942
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:02,459
Well, we got to do something.

943
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:06,029
Well, isn't she
going back to New York?

944
00:51:06,129 --> 00:51:07,330
You're not upset
at this, are you?

945
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:08,231
Of course, I am.

946
00:51:08,331 --> 00:51:09,766
Paul's sleeping with Nina.

947
00:51:09,866 --> 00:51:11,768
It's shocking, it's--
it's inappropriate,

948
00:51:11,868 --> 00:51:13,236
but it's not wrong, is it?

949
00:51:13,336 --> 00:51:14,137
I didn't say that.

950
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:15,472
Of course, it's wrong.

951
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:17,274
He didn't want to pass up an
opportunity to get a little.

952
00:51:17,374 --> 00:51:18,375
Stop it.

953
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:20,177
So what if he completely
screws up his life.

954
00:51:20,277 --> 00:51:22,746
He's just doing what a
guy's got to do, right?

955
00:51:22,846 --> 00:51:23,647
[door slamming]

956
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:27,150
[dramatic music]

957
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:42,466
DENNIS: Paul.
Paul!

958
00:51:42,566 --> 00:51:43,600
ABBY: Where are you going?

959
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,001
If I can't see Nina as
long as I'm living here,

960
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:47,170
I don't want to
live here anymore.

961
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:49,206
Paul, don't you dare leave!

962
00:51:49,306 --> 00:51:50,207
Paul!

963
00:51:53,343 --> 00:51:55,612
Un-freaking-believable.

964
00:51:55,712 --> 00:51:58,782
[chuckles]

965
00:51:58,882 --> 00:52:00,350
Gulliver, you got
to promise me you're

966
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:01,485
not going to tell anybody.

967
00:52:01,585 --> 00:52:02,586
No, I promise.

968
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:03,487
PAUL: No, really.

969
00:52:03,587 --> 00:52:06,022
Of course, I promise.

970
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:08,125
PAUL: [sighs] Man,
she's incredible.

971
00:52:08,225 --> 00:52:09,926
I've never met anybody like her.

972
00:52:14,764 --> 00:52:18,335
So, um, does she know all
kinds of tricks and stuff,

973
00:52:18,435 --> 00:52:21,071
or what?

974
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:22,038
I'm just asking.

975
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:23,974
No, it's not about the sex.

976
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:26,076
I'm telling you.

977
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:28,111
So much more to it than that.

978
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:31,548
Oh, w-- wait, so what?

979
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:32,816
You're, like, in love with her?

980
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:39,856
[sighs] I don't know.

981
00:52:39,956 --> 00:52:42,392
It's definitely not like
it is with Cindy, though.

982
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:43,493
So what are you going to do?

983
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:48,331
She's going back to New York.

984
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:54,137
Are you going to go with her?

985
00:52:54,237 --> 00:52:56,373
I don't know.

986
00:52:56,473 --> 00:52:58,975
Everything's changed.

987
00:52:59,075 --> 00:53:00,010
Everything.

988
00:53:19,896 --> 00:53:21,364
DENNIS: Was Paul here?

989
00:53:21,464 --> 00:53:22,632
No.

990
00:53:22,732 --> 00:53:24,968
Do you know where he is?

991
00:53:25,068 --> 00:53:28,705
I haven't seen him
since last night.

992
00:53:28,805 --> 00:53:31,942
Abby told me about last night.

993
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:34,110
Well, if you came here
to read me the Riot Act,

994
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:35,178
you can save your breath.

995
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:36,913
She already did that.

996
00:53:37,013 --> 00:53:39,950
Abby has a right to be
upset, Nina, and so do I.

997
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,185
So be upset.

998
00:53:42,285 --> 00:53:44,187
He's a kid!

999
00:53:44,287 --> 00:53:48,458
He's a lot more together
than most adults I know.

1000
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:49,459
What were you thinking?

1001
00:53:53,296 --> 00:53:55,799
I wasn't thinking, OK?

1002
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:56,766
[serene music]

1003
00:53:56,866 --> 00:53:58,235
I spent time with
somebody who was

1004
00:53:58,335 --> 00:54:04,441
really terrific and
passionate and fun.

1005
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:07,744
And I went with it.

1006
00:54:07,844 --> 00:54:09,713
You know what that's
like, Dennis, don't you?

1007
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:14,684
Or have you forgotten?

1008
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:19,789
No.

1009
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,961
No, I haven't forgotten.

1010
00:54:32,168 --> 00:54:33,370
Stay away from him, Nina.

1011
00:54:36,673 --> 00:54:37,574
Or what?

1012
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:44,648
If he comes by, tell him his
mother and I want to see him.

1013
00:54:52,756 --> 00:54:54,124
I want to know
what's going on.

1014
00:54:54,224 --> 00:54:55,659
[sighs] I don't have
time to talk right now.

1015
00:54:55,759 --> 00:54:57,460
Why did you run out on
me like that last night?

1016
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,162
I'm going to be
late for class.

1017
00:54:59,262 --> 00:55:00,063
Paul, can we just talk--

1018
00:55:00,163 --> 00:55:01,631
Would you just
leave me alone, OK?

1019
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:09,839
[car approaching]

1020
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:21,651
Hey.

1021
00:55:21,751 --> 00:55:22,986
I was coming to look for you.

1022
00:55:27,624 --> 00:55:29,959
I, uh, I moved out.

1023
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:32,062
I'm staying with a friend.

1024
00:55:38,134 --> 00:55:40,036
[sighs]

1025
00:55:42,472 --> 00:55:47,577
Look, I just want
you to know that I

1026
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:51,848
don't feel bad about anything.

1027
00:55:51,948 --> 00:55:52,949
I-- I don't.

1028
00:55:53,049 --> 00:55:55,285
I mean, you're--
you're terrific.

1029
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:04,327
I-- I just wanted you
to know that before you

1030
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:07,731
went back to New York.

1031
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:10,166
[dramatic music]

1032
00:56:10,266 --> 00:56:11,167
I'm not going back.

1033
00:56:14,771 --> 00:56:15,672
Why not?

1034
00:56:18,308 --> 00:56:19,943
Going back to New York
is just running away,

1035
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:22,612
and I don't want to do that.

1036
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:23,880
[sensual music]

1037
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:27,517
I don't care what Abby or
Dennis or anybody thinks.

1038
00:56:27,617 --> 00:56:29,953
It's nobody's business
who I spend my time with.

1039
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:37,360
And I want to spend it with you.

1040
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:38,395
So what are you saying?

1041
00:56:41,965 --> 00:56:44,267
I'm saying you're
the sweetest, most

1042
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:46,603
wonderful thing that's
happened to me in a long time.

1043
00:56:51,508 --> 00:56:52,675
I want us to be together.

1044
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:21,571
Well, we can't stay
here, that's for sure.

1045
00:57:21,671 --> 00:57:23,440
Every time I open
a closet, I think

1046
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:25,341
my mother's going to jump out.

1047
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:28,778
[chuckling]

1048
00:57:29,813 --> 00:57:32,248
So what's your place
like in New York?

1049
00:57:32,348 --> 00:57:35,051
Mm, it's a big loft.

1050
00:57:35,151 --> 00:57:35,952
Really?

1051
00:57:36,052 --> 00:57:37,887
You know, I heard they're, uh.

1052
00:57:37,987 --> 00:57:40,557
Converting old warehouses
into lofts downtown.

1053
00:57:40,657 --> 00:57:43,226
Maybe we could get one of those.

1054
00:57:43,326 --> 00:57:44,894
Yeah, well, I guess
we could take a look.

1055
00:57:44,994 --> 00:57:45,895
Think about it.

1056
00:57:45,995 --> 00:57:47,797
Like, a place with
a lot of light.

1057
00:57:47,897 --> 00:57:48,798
I could build a darkroom.

1058
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:53,870
You make it sound so easy.

1059
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:54,871
Well, it is.

1060
00:57:57,807 --> 00:57:59,309
Is it?

1061
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:02,612
Yes, it is.

1062
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:03,613
[giggles]

1063
00:58:03,713 --> 00:58:04,514
Oh.

1064
00:58:04,614 --> 00:58:05,582
I'll show you easy.

1065
00:58:05,682 --> 00:58:07,484
[chuckling]

1066
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:08,718
Ella!

1067
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:11,187
Come on, kiddo, we're
going to be late.

1068
00:58:11,287 --> 00:58:13,122
Dennis, I need to talk to you.

1069
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:14,257
Why don't you give us a second?

1070
00:58:19,395 --> 00:58:21,264
I just spoke to Gulliver.

1071
00:58:21,364 --> 00:58:22,465
And?

1072
00:58:22,565 --> 00:58:23,800
Paul's moving in with Nina.

1073
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:27,237
She's not going
back to New York.

1074
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:30,740
[sighs] Well, at least they're
not running away together.

1075
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,942
Damn it, Dennis, is
that the best you can do?

1076
00:58:33,042 --> 00:58:35,245
Let's be smart here.

1077
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,247
I mean, we tried tough
love and that didn't work.

1078
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:38,948
Psych 101, the more we
try to keep them apart,

1079
00:58:39,048 --> 00:58:40,483
the more they're going
to want to be together.

1080
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:41,784
Well, what are
we supposed to do?

1081
00:58:41,885 --> 00:58:44,621
Stand around and do nothing
while she ruins his life?

1082
00:58:44,721 --> 00:58:46,923
Look, Paul's a
terrific kid, not least

1083
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:48,658
because we've had
him for 18 years.

1084
00:58:48,758 --> 00:58:50,493
And if we've done as good
a job as I think we have,

1085
00:58:50,593 --> 00:58:51,794
he'll-- he'll come around.

1086
00:58:51,895 --> 00:58:53,429
He's not going to want to
keep playing house with her.

1087
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,899
Well, you'd
know, wouldn't you?

1088
00:58:55,999 --> 00:58:57,867
What?

1089
00:58:57,967 --> 00:59:00,003
He's thinking with
his crotch, Dennis.

1090
00:59:00,103 --> 00:59:01,738
That wipes out 18 years.

1091
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:03,206
That wipes out everything.

1092
00:59:03,306 --> 00:59:04,407
Look at us.

1093
00:59:04,507 --> 00:59:06,142
Where would we be if we'd
been thinking instead

1094
00:59:06,242 --> 00:59:09,879
of sleeping together in 1978?

1095
00:59:09,979 --> 00:59:12,482
Right here, I hope,
together with two great kids.

1096
00:59:16,586 --> 00:59:19,522
We have a good life, Abby.

1097
00:59:19,622 --> 00:59:20,957
It could have been
a whole lot better.

1098
00:59:29,365 --> 00:59:32,435
Paul's not coming home, is he?

1099
00:59:32,535 --> 00:59:35,038
Well, it's kind
of complicated.

1100
00:59:35,138 --> 00:59:36,839
Paul and Nina care
about each other.

1101
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:38,441
What's so wrong with that?

1102
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:39,876
It just is, sweetheart.

1103
00:59:39,976 --> 00:59:41,778
You just don't understand
how complicated--

1104
00:59:41,878 --> 00:59:45,448
Right, because I'm a kid
and you're the adult, right?

1105
00:59:45,548 --> 00:59:49,986
Well, adults are supposed to
make things better, not worse.

1106
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:51,421
We're not making it worse.

1107
00:59:51,521 --> 00:59:53,189
Well, you're not making
it better, are you?

1108
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:59,395
[chatter]

1109
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:18,848
Bastard!

1110
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:22,452
[somber music]

1111
01:00:30,426 --> 01:00:31,427
Hey, there's Paul.

1112
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:37,900
Hey.

1113
01:00:42,905 --> 01:00:43,906
Oh, hey, uh.

1114
01:00:44,007 --> 01:00:45,208
- Oh!
- Watch it!

1115
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:46,142
- Ow!
- Oh!

1116
01:00:46,242 --> 01:00:47,043
Oh!

1117
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:49,512
[complaining]

1118
01:00:54,283 --> 01:00:55,218
You told everybody.

1119
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:56,352
Let go of me, man.

1120
01:00:56,452 --> 01:00:57,587
- You promised me.
- What?

1121
01:00:57,687 --> 01:00:59,122
Do you think people
weren't going to find out?

1122
01:00:59,222 --> 01:01:00,490
I thought this is,
like, the greatest thing

1123
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:01,457
that ever happened to you.

1124
01:01:01,557 --> 01:01:02,759
Hey, hey, break
it up, break it up.

1125
01:01:02,859 --> 01:01:04,861
Both of you.

1126
01:01:04,961 --> 01:01:07,797
Just chill out, man.

1127
01:01:07,897 --> 01:01:08,765
Damn.

1128
01:01:21,911 --> 01:01:23,246
Hey.

1129
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:24,147
Hi.

1130
01:01:24,247 --> 01:01:25,248
I didn't think you'd be home.

1131
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:28,818
I just came by to pick
up some extra stuff.

1132
01:01:28,918 --> 01:01:31,688
You're still over at Nina's?

1133
01:01:31,788 --> 01:01:35,058
Yeah, we're looking to
get our own place together.

1134
01:01:35,158 --> 01:01:36,059
Are you?

1135
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:43,132
You know, uh, it's Ella's
birthday on Saturday.

1136
01:01:43,232 --> 01:01:45,902
We're having a party.

1137
01:01:46,002 --> 01:01:48,838
It would mean the world
to her if you'd come.

1138
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:53,743
Is Nina invited?

1139
01:01:53,843 --> 01:01:56,245
I don't think your
mother would like that.

1140
01:01:56,345 --> 01:01:57,513
Then I can't come.

1141
01:01:57,613 --> 01:02:00,283
Paul, you cannot blame
her for being upset.

1142
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:04,620
I mean, dammit, you're
sleeping with her best friend.

1143
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:08,591
Look, she's got some old
issues to work out, but she's--

1144
01:02:08,691 --> 01:02:10,626
all her-- her hopes
for you, her plans.

1145
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:13,629
Look, dad, I can't
live mom's life for her.

1146
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:16,866
No, no, but you can
consider her feelings.

1147
01:02:19,368 --> 01:02:21,471
Look, I think you're making
a terrible mistake here.

1148
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:23,873
You're-- you're setting
things in motion that you--

1149
01:02:23,973 --> 01:02:26,876
you just have no idea about.

1150
01:02:26,976 --> 01:02:29,412
But it is your decision, and--

1151
01:02:29,512 --> 01:02:31,514
and you just have to live
with the consequences.

1152
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:40,356
Whatever happens,
this is your home.

1153
01:02:40,456 --> 01:02:43,292
Always will be.

1154
01:02:43,392 --> 01:02:46,195
Remember that.

1155
01:02:46,295 --> 01:02:48,531
Thanks, Dad.

1156
01:02:48,631 --> 01:02:52,068

[knocking]

1159
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:10,987
Come on in, it's open.

1160
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:25,001
Hello, Nina.

1161
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,075
What are you doing here?

1162
01:03:33,176 --> 01:03:34,577
Are you surprised?

1163
01:03:34,677 --> 01:03:36,746
You didn't think I was going
to let you just disappear out

1164
01:03:36,846 --> 01:03:40,249
of my life forever, did you?

1165
01:03:40,349 --> 01:03:44,086
I am not part of your
life, Robert, not anymore.

1166
01:03:44,187 --> 01:03:46,289
Hey, listen, I
left Karen for you.

1167
01:03:46,389 --> 01:03:48,057
I'm divorcing her.

1168
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:50,326
Well, I didn't
ask you to do that.

1169
01:03:50,426 --> 01:03:53,329
I thought that's
what you wanted.

1170
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:55,832
[door opening]

1171
01:03:55,932 --> 01:03:58,234
Maybe a long time ago,
but we're way past that now.

1172
01:04:06,242 --> 01:04:07,276
Hey.

1173
01:04:07,376 --> 01:04:08,277
Hey.

1174
01:04:18,988 --> 01:04:22,325
Um, this is Robert,
an old friend.

1175
01:04:24,961 --> 01:04:25,828
How do you do?

1176
01:04:25,928 --> 01:04:28,798
Hi.

1177
01:04:28,898 --> 01:04:29,799
[suspenseful music]

1178
01:04:29,899 --> 01:04:31,033
Robert and I
have some business

1179
01:04:31,133 --> 01:04:32,034
that we have to discuss.

1180
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:50,720
You know, the night I met
you a little voice inside me

1181
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:52,822
said this woman's
trouble, Robert.

1182
01:04:52,922 --> 01:04:55,925
You know, you should walk
away from her now and fast.

1183
01:04:56,025 --> 01:04:58,995
And I wish to god I had.

1184
01:04:59,095 --> 01:05:01,063
How old is that boy, anyway?

1185
01:05:01,163 --> 01:05:01,964
Do you even care?

1186
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:03,132
I want you to leave.

1187
01:05:03,232 --> 01:05:05,301
Did he leave his
family for you?

1188
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:08,371
Did you break a few more
hearts just to sweeten the pot?

1189
01:05:08,471 --> 01:05:10,573
You broke Karen's
heart, Robert.

1190
01:05:10,673 --> 01:05:13,843
And you would have broken mine.

1191
01:05:13,943 --> 01:05:17,280
Now get out of my house.

1192
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:18,381
You're sick, Nina.

1193
01:05:52,081 --> 01:05:54,083

Hungry?

1195
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:31,620
I thought you said it
was over with Robert.

1196
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:32,621
It is.

1197
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:38,627
You said he would
never leave his wife,

1198
01:06:38,728 --> 01:06:41,030
and that's why you
broke up with him.

1199
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:41,998
Yes.

1200
01:06:42,098 --> 01:06:45,234
But-- but now
he's divorcing her.

1201
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:46,235
So?

1202
01:06:49,138 --> 01:06:52,975
So are you guys getting
back together or what?

1203
01:06:53,075 --> 01:06:55,978
Of course, not.

1204
01:06:56,078 --> 01:06:58,681
[sighs] Well, he sure
must think so to come

1205
01:06:58,781 --> 01:07:00,649
all the way out here.

1206
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:03,452
People believe what
they want to, Paul,

1207
01:07:03,552 --> 01:07:05,054
even if it isn't true.

1208
01:07:05,154 --> 01:07:06,222
Maybe that's what we're doing.

1209
01:07:08,758 --> 01:07:10,926
What do you mean?

1210
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:13,162
Maybe we're just pretending
this is going to work and, uh,

1211
01:07:13,262 --> 01:07:14,163
it isn't.

1213

Is that pretend?

Is it?

01:08:28,137 --> 01:08:31,173
What about this?

1218
01:08:31,273 --> 01:08:33,342
It's kind of slutty.

1219
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:35,177
[scoffs] So
should I try it on?

1220

1221
01:08:43,052 --> 01:08:44,687
Look, I'll be back
in a minute, OK?

1222
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:45,688
Sure.

1223
01:08:51,427 --> 01:08:54,463
Hey, Nina.

1224
01:08:54,563 --> 01:08:55,498
Ella, hi.

1225
01:08:59,001 --> 01:09:00,903
I didn't know
you shopped here.

1226
01:09:01,003 --> 01:09:02,037
Just browsing.

1227
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:05,174
Yeah, me too.

1228
01:09:05,274 --> 01:09:07,276
How are you?

1229
01:09:07,376 --> 01:09:08,277
Great.

1230
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:13,449
Good.

1231
01:09:13,549 --> 01:09:19,555
Listen, I'm glad I
ran into you because mom

1232
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:21,557
and dad are throwing me
this, like, massive party

1233
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:23,592
Saturday afternoon.

1234
01:09:23,692 --> 01:09:25,194
It's, like, probably
going to be really lame,

1235
01:09:25,294 --> 01:09:29,999
but I'd like you guys
to come, you and Paul.

1236
01:09:30,099 --> 01:09:31,167
Abby wouldn't like it, Ella.

1237
01:09:31,267 --> 01:09:33,269
No, actually I talked to her.

1238
01:09:33,369 --> 01:09:34,904
And she said it would be OK.

1239
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:36,305
Really?

1240
01:09:36,405 --> 01:09:38,874
Well, yeah, I mean she's still
a little weirded out about you

1241
01:09:38,974 --> 01:09:41,243
and Paul, but, I mean, she
said this is only, like,

1242
01:09:41,343 --> 01:09:43,646
my most important birthday
in the whole world,

1243
01:09:43,746 --> 01:09:49,451
so she said it would be like
a cease-fire or something.

1244
01:09:49,552 --> 01:09:51,520
Are you sure?

1245
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:53,055
Look, I was going
to call you tonight.

1246
01:09:55,824 --> 01:09:58,093
I'll talk to Paul.

1247
01:09:58,194 --> 01:09:59,395
Great.

1248
01:09:59,495 --> 01:10:01,730
Ella?

1249
01:10:01,830 --> 01:10:04,300
Look, I've got
to get going, but I

1250
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,635
guess I'll see you on Saturday.

1251
01:10:06,735 --> 01:10:07,570
We'll see.

1252
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:08,704
OK.

1253
01:10:08,804 --> 01:10:09,605
Bye.

What are you doing?

1256
01:10:14,677 --> 01:10:15,578
It's OK.

[door opening]

1258
01:10:25,821 --> 01:10:27,256
Hey.

1259
01:10:27,356 --> 01:10:28,457
Hey.

1260
01:10:28,557 --> 01:10:31,160
Oh, let me guess.

Car parts.

1262
01:10:33,696 --> 01:10:36,165
I've been living
out of a suitcase.

1263
01:10:36,265 --> 01:10:38,367
So then why don't we just
take a little trip to New York

1264
01:10:38,467 --> 01:10:39,802
and pick up the
rest of your stuff?

1265
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:41,570
Oh, I think you
just want a free trip.

1266
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:43,539
Ah.

1267
01:10:43,639 --> 01:10:45,374
Busted.

1268
01:10:45,474 --> 01:10:48,911
Speaking of busted,
I ran into Ella.

1269
01:10:49,011 --> 01:10:50,646
Really?

1270
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:52,514
How is she?

1271
01:10:52,615 --> 01:10:54,617
She's going to
be 16 on Saturday.

1272
01:10:54,717 --> 01:10:56,185
And there's a party.

1273
01:10:56,285 --> 01:10:57,319
Yeah, I know.

1274
01:10:57,419 --> 01:11:00,689
Um, my dad told me.

1275
01:11:00,789 --> 01:11:03,559
Huh, are you going?

1276
01:11:03,659 --> 01:11:06,495
Mm, I don't know.

1277
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:11,367
Well, Ella invited
me, I mean, us.

1278
01:11:11,467 --> 01:11:13,969
She said that Abby's willing
to lay down the sword,

1279
01:11:14,069 --> 01:11:15,638
at least for that afternoon.

1280
01:11:15,738 --> 01:11:17,106
Really?

1281
01:11:17,206 --> 01:11:18,407
So do you want to go?

1282
01:11:21,977 --> 01:11:23,212
I don't know.

1283
01:11:23,312 --> 01:11:25,414
I'm not so sure it's the best
time for a family reunion.

1284
01:11:25,514 --> 01:11:27,249
Well, we can't spend
the rest of our lives

1285
01:11:27,349 --> 01:11:29,752
avoiding my family.

1286
01:11:29,852 --> 01:11:32,921
Maybe this is just my
mom's way of patching

1287
01:11:33,022 --> 01:11:36,258
things up without losing face.

1288
01:11:36,358 --> 01:11:40,729
I don't know,
but you should go.

1289
01:11:40,829 --> 01:11:42,531
You know how much it
would mean to Ella.

1290
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:43,432
No.

1291
01:11:43,532 --> 01:11:45,200
No, we're in this together.

1292
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:47,803
I'm not going unless
you go with me.

1293
01:11:47,903 --> 01:11:49,538
Let me think about it, OK?

1294
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:50,539
Sure.

1295
01:11:54,476 --> 01:11:57,913

1296
01:12:01,784 --> 01:12:05,254
[chatting, laughter]

1297
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:12,294
Hi.

1298
01:12:12,394 --> 01:12:13,662
Hi, Heather.

1299
01:12:13,762 --> 01:12:14,563
Hi, Karina.

1300
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:15,664
Hi.

1301
01:12:15,764 --> 01:12:16,699
OK.

1302
01:12:16,799 --> 01:12:18,634
Michael, what were
you doing upstairs?

1303
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:19,635
Get out there.

1304
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:23,772
You're just starting those now?

1305
01:12:23,872 --> 01:12:25,240
I love you, too.

1306
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:26,241
Hurry up!

1307
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:32,681
Hey.

1308
01:12:32,781 --> 01:12:33,682
Ella!

1309
01:12:33,782 --> 01:12:36,151
Oh, Heather, hi!

1310
01:12:36,251 --> 01:12:38,954
I'm so glad you came.

1311
01:12:39,054 --> 01:12:43,926
(SINGING) Yes, I know
what I'm talking about.

1312
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:48,964
Yes, I know what
I'm talking about.

1313
01:12:49,064 --> 01:12:49,865
You need more than that.

1314
01:12:49,965 --> 01:12:51,734
Yeah, I need more, yeah.

1315
01:12:54,336 --> 01:12:56,271
Cindy, honey, could
you give me a hand here?

1316
01:12:57,606 --> 01:12:59,308
(SINGING) I can't
make it no more.

1317
01:12:59,408 --> 01:13:01,243
Got to get back out the door.

1318
01:13:01,343 --> 01:13:03,112
I didn't break it--

1319
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:05,013
I need you to help me
with cake and candles.

1320
01:13:10,519 --> 01:13:11,687
I'm going to find, Ella.

1321
01:13:11,787 --> 01:13:12,688
Oh, all right.

1322
01:13:16,325 --> 01:13:18,160
- Pretty.
- Think we have enough of these?

1323
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:19,061
ABBY: Oh, we do.

1324
01:13:19,161 --> 01:13:20,362
(SINGING) Bam!

1325
01:13:20,462 --> 01:13:21,263
Bam!

1326
01:13:21,363 --> 01:13:22,998
I'm talking to you.

1327
01:13:23,098 --> 01:13:23,999
What?

1328
01:13:24,099 --> 01:13:26,402
You look like you
just saw a ghost.

1329
01:13:26,502 --> 01:13:28,203
I did.

1330
01:13:28,303 --> 01:13:29,738
Hey, happy birthday.

1331
01:13:29,838 --> 01:13:30,706
Oh!
You came!

1332
01:13:30,806 --> 01:13:31,707
Oh!

1333
01:13:34,543 --> 01:13:35,778
Oh, I missed you.

1334
01:13:35,878 --> 01:13:36,779
I missed you, too.

1335
01:13:40,449 --> 01:13:41,583
What?

1336
01:13:41,683 --> 01:13:43,252
Look who's here.

1337
01:13:43,352 --> 01:13:44,253
I'll be damned.

1338
01:13:49,057 --> 01:13:49,992
You got to open this present.

1339
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:51,260
Oh!

1340
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:52,728
I'm telling you, it's the
best one I've gotten you.

1341
01:13:52,828 --> 01:13:53,629
Oh, sweet heart.

1342
01:13:53,729 --> 01:13:55,197
I'm so glad you showed up.

1343
01:13:55,297 --> 01:13:56,198
Thank you.

1344
01:13:56,298 --> 01:13:57,466
PAUL: Uh, you're welcome.
Hey, Dad.

1345
01:13:57,566 --> 01:13:58,934
- Hey, pal.
- How's it going?

1346
01:13:59,034 --> 01:13:59,835
It's good to see you.

1347
01:13:59,935 --> 01:14:00,669
Good to see you, too.

1348
01:14:00,769 --> 01:14:01,670
DENNIS: Glad you made it.

1349
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:07,676
What are you doing here?

1350
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:09,311
Get the hell out of here!

1351
01:14:09,411 --> 01:14:10,212
Abby.

1352
01:14:10,312 --> 01:14:11,246
Get out of here!

1353
01:14:11,346 --> 01:14:12,848
ELLA: No!
No!

1354
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:13,849
No!

1355
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:15,317
I invited her.

1356
01:14:15,417 --> 01:14:16,218
You invited her?

1357
01:14:16,318 --> 01:14:17,119
Why?

1358
01:14:17,219 --> 01:14:18,353
To humiliate me?

1359
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:19,688
ELLA: No, of course, not.
Why would I?

1360
01:14:19,788 --> 01:14:20,689
You're not welcome here.

1361
01:14:20,789 --> 01:14:22,224
Not now, not ever.

1362
01:14:22,324 --> 01:14:23,125
I'm sorry.

1365
01:14:25,494 --> 01:14:26,328
Honey?

1366
01:14:26,428 --> 01:14:27,529
Ella?

1367
01:14:27,629 --> 01:14:28,530
Thanks a lot, Mom.

1368
01:14:31,099 --> 01:14:33,402
I want to talk to you.

1369
01:14:33,502 --> 01:14:34,336
Ella, what's going on?

1370
01:14:34,436 --> 01:14:35,304
I hate her.

1371
01:14:35,404 --> 01:14:38,207
I hate her!

1372
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:39,174
Ella!

1373
01:14:39,274 --> 01:14:40,142
Wait a sec.

1374
01:14:40,242 --> 01:14:41,043
I'll go get her, OK?

1375
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:42,211
Stay here.

1376
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:43,912
I can't believe that
bitch ruined Ella's party.

1377
01:14:44,012 --> 01:14:44,947
She didn't ruin anything.

1378
01:14:45,047 --> 01:14:45,881
You attacked her in
front of everyone.

1379
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:47,483
Oh, that's right!
Take her side!

1380
01:14:47,583 --> 01:14:48,617
I'm taking Ella's side.

1381
01:14:48,717 --> 01:14:49,651
This is Ella's party.

1382
01:14:49,751 --> 01:14:51,487
I will not have that
woman in my house!

Ella!

1390
01:14:59,862 --> 01:15:01,096
Ella, can you just
wait a second?

1391
01:15:01,196 --> 01:15:02,064
Ella.

1392
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:02,965
Ella, hold on.

1393
01:15:03,065 --> 01:15:03,866
Wait.

01:15:03,966 --> 01:15:05,767

01:15:23,585 --> 01:15:25,053

How's Ella?

01:16:13,468 --> 01:16:19,274
[sighs] She's, uh,
she's going to be OK.

1415
01:16:19,374 --> 01:16:24,146
She bruised her collarbone
and broke one of her legs,

1416
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:27,149
but, um, she was pretty lucky.

1417
01:16:32,354 --> 01:16:33,655
I'm-- I'm real tired.

1418
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:34,923
I'm going to head upstairs.

1420
01:17:20,035 --> 01:17:22,237
What are you doing here?

1421
01:17:22,337 --> 01:17:23,639
We have to talk.

1422
01:17:23,739 --> 01:17:26,908
There's nothing to talk about.

1423
01:17:27,009 --> 01:17:28,310
I'm not leaving until we do.

1424
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:32,748
Five minutes.

1425
01:17:45,727 --> 01:17:47,729
Well?

1426
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:51,600
Well-- well, things have
gotten pretty screwed up,

1427
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:52,534
haven't they?

1428
01:17:52,634 --> 01:17:55,237
What did you expect?

1429
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:56,171
Not this, Abby.

1430
01:17:56,271 --> 01:17:58,306
I never expected any of this.

1431
01:17:58,407 --> 01:17:59,841
Yeah, you never meant
for this to happen.

1432
01:17:59,941 --> 01:18:00,876
You never do.

1433
01:18:00,976 --> 01:18:02,611
No, of course, not,
but that doesn't mean

1434
01:18:02,711 --> 01:18:04,079
that you and I shouldn't--

1435
01:18:04,179 --> 01:18:05,547
Tell me something, Nina.

1436
01:18:05,647 --> 01:18:08,483
Did you go after Paul for
the sheer perversity of it?

1437
01:18:08,583 --> 01:18:12,721
Or was it a chance to get
back at me for Dennis?

1438
01:18:12,821 --> 01:18:13,922
What?

1439
01:18:14,022 --> 01:18:16,591
That summer after
my sophomore year,

1440
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:19,828
you think I don't
know what happened?

1441
01:18:19,928 --> 01:18:22,030
I-- I don't know what
you're talking about.

1442
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:23,732
Oh, sure you do.

1443
01:18:23,832 --> 01:18:25,967
I went to San Diego
for a long weekend.

1444
01:18:26,068 --> 01:18:30,505
And while I was gone, you
slept with my boyfriend.

1445
01:18:30,605 --> 01:18:32,274
Dennis told you?

1446
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:35,210
No, he didn't have to.

1447
01:18:35,310 --> 01:18:37,746
God, I could practically smell
him on you when I got back.

1448
01:18:40,482 --> 01:18:41,950
I didn't think you knew.

1449
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:44,352
Yeah, and you're still in
the same rut, aren't you, Nina?

1450
01:18:44,453 --> 01:18:46,955
Still starting affairs that
can't possibly go anywhere.

1451
01:18:47,055 --> 01:18:50,525
Or if they do have a future,
finding a way to ruin them.

1452
01:18:50,625 --> 01:18:54,296
Well, you ruined
that one for me, Abby.

1453
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:55,197
What?

1454
01:18:55,297 --> 01:18:56,298
By getting pregnant?

1455
01:18:56,398 --> 01:18:57,799
Give me a break.

1456
01:18:57,899 --> 01:18:59,901
Getting pregnant
changed my whole life.

1457
01:19:00,001 --> 01:19:02,804
You think that it's me you're
mad at, but it isn't, it's you.

1458
01:19:02,904 --> 01:19:06,308
You were always beating
yourself up for the great life

1459
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:08,043
that you think
you missed out on.

1460
01:19:08,143 --> 01:19:10,312
Well, you had better
get over it and fast

1461
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:13,749
or you are going to miss the
great life that you have now.

1462
01:19:13,849 --> 01:19:16,485
Don't you lecture
me about my life.

1463
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:20,455
You don't have any sense of
my reality or anybody else's.

1464
01:19:20,555 --> 01:19:22,758
You do what you want,
you go where you please.

1465
01:19:22,858 --> 01:19:25,961
You think that makes you strong.

1466
01:19:26,061 --> 01:19:27,429
You don't connect
with anybody, Nina.

1467
01:19:27,529 --> 01:19:29,030
You're too damn selfish.

1468
01:19:29,131 --> 01:19:31,433
NINA: Oh, that is so unfair.

1469
01:19:31,533 --> 01:19:33,902
ABBY: Are you thinking
about Paul at all?

1470
01:19:34,002 --> 01:19:36,004
About how he's going to feel
when you get tired of him

1471
01:19:36,104 --> 01:19:38,073
because you will?

1472
01:19:38,173 --> 01:19:40,175
Yeah, you think I'm
pissed off about my life.

1473
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:42,043
Yeah, maybe I am sometimes.

1474
01:19:42,144 --> 01:19:46,181
But I love my family,
and I love my son.

1475
01:19:46,281 --> 01:19:47,315
Who do you love, Nina?

1476
01:19:52,554 --> 01:19:55,490
That feels like
five minutes to me.

1477
01:19:55,590 --> 01:19:57,025
[sighs]

1478
01:19:59,394 --> 01:20:01,530
That was great.

1479
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:03,932
Liar.

1480
01:20:04,032 --> 01:20:06,101
Cooking is not my best feature.

1481
01:20:06,201 --> 01:20:07,736
Well, you could
have fooled me.

1482
01:20:15,277 --> 01:20:17,746
Close your eyes.

1483
01:20:17,846 --> 01:20:18,647
What for?

1484
01:20:18,747 --> 01:20:21,316
Just close them.

1485
01:20:21,416 --> 01:20:23,451
Well, I've got
something for you.

1486
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:24,352
Come on, really?

1487
01:20:24,452 --> 01:20:26,388
Yes.

1488
01:20:26,488 --> 01:20:28,323
I'm not going to give it to
you if you don't close them.

1489
01:20:28,423 --> 01:20:29,858
OK.

1490
01:20:29,958 --> 01:20:30,859
They're closed.

1491
01:20:39,434 --> 01:20:41,369
OK, you can open them.

1492
01:20:46,708 --> 01:20:47,642
Open it.

1493
01:20:47,742 --> 01:20:51,213
[sensual music]

PAUL: [sighs]

1495
01:20:58,186 --> 01:20:59,654
Oh, man.

1496
01:20:59,754 --> 01:21:00,822
I found it in a closet.

1497
01:21:00,922 --> 01:21:01,923
It must have been my father's.

1498
01:21:08,330 --> 01:21:11,299
It's beautiful.

1499
01:21:11,399 --> 01:21:12,868
Well, take beautiful
pictures with it.

1500
01:21:16,137 --> 01:21:17,038
Save some for me.

1501
01:21:22,811 --> 01:21:25,313
I'm going back to New York.

1502
01:21:25,413 --> 01:21:28,316
I have a lot of business I
have to take care of there.

1503
01:21:28,416 --> 01:21:30,585
And I'm already going
stir crazy here, so--

1504
01:21:30,685 --> 01:21:31,486
That's fine.

1505
01:21:31,586 --> 01:21:33,755
I'll just, uh, go back with you.

1506
01:21:33,855 --> 01:21:34,756
NINA: No.

1507
01:21:41,162 --> 01:21:43,131
[scoffs]

1508
01:21:45,166 --> 01:21:46,001
Why?

1509
01:21:46,101 --> 01:21:47,469
You don't want me
to go with you?

1510
01:21:51,439 --> 01:21:53,808
This isn't going to
work, and you know that.

1511
01:21:57,979 --> 01:21:59,948
No, uh, I don't.

1512
01:22:00,048 --> 01:22:01,850
Yeah, the past couple
of days have been hard--

1513
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:05,420
And you're thinking
about moving home.

1514
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:06,621
And that's where you belong.

1515

1517
01:22:27,809 --> 01:22:28,710
Sorry.

1518
01:22:35,517 --> 01:22:36,418
No.

1519
01:22:41,723 --> 01:22:44,092
Don't you be sorry
on my account ever.

01:23:31,873 --> 01:23:32,774
Sweetie, be careful.

1523
01:23:36,077 --> 01:23:37,112
Ella, you're doing great.

1524
01:23:37,212 --> 01:23:38,013
DENNIS: There you go, Ella.

1525
01:23:38,113 --> 01:23:38,913
Yeah.

1526
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:41,116
There you go.

1527
01:23:41,216 --> 01:23:41,983
Hungry?

1528
01:23:42,083 --> 01:23:42,884
No.

1529
01:23:42,984 --> 01:23:44,019
Chicken soup.

1530
01:23:44,119 --> 01:23:45,053
No.

1531
01:23:45,153 --> 01:23:46,287
Too much hospital food?

1532
01:23:46,388 --> 01:23:48,223
[chuckles] Yeah.

1533
01:23:48,323 --> 01:23:49,657
Here you go.
I made these myself.

1534
01:23:49,758 --> 01:23:50,558
Oh, ooh!

1535
01:23:50,658 --> 01:23:52,193

1536
01:23:52,293 --> 01:23:53,294
Right, up.

DENNIS: And--
- --ooh, is that hard?

1538
01:23:54,963 --> 01:23:55,797
Yeah.
DENNIS: --attam.

1539
01:23:55,897 --> 01:23:56,831
Bingo.

1540
01:23:56,931 --> 01:23:57,999
OK, put this back.

1541
01:23:58,099 --> 01:23:59,501
And it'll hurt for--

1542
01:23:59,601 --> 01:24:00,535
- OK.
- Better?

1543
01:24:00,635 --> 01:24:01,436
Uh-huh.

1544
01:24:01,536 --> 01:24:02,337
Yeah?

1545
01:24:02,437 --> 01:24:03,905
Yeah.

1546
01:24:04,005 --> 01:24:07,442
[door closing]

1547
01:24:20,755 --> 01:24:23,158
More in the car?

1548
01:24:23,258 --> 01:24:25,727
Yeah.

1549
01:24:25,827 --> 01:24:27,829
I'll get it.

Well, I still don't
know what I'm doing.

[sighs]

1555
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:04,499
I want to be here with you guys.

1556
01:25:10,972 --> 01:25:15,376
But as far as Stanhope
goes, uh, I just don't know.

1557
01:25:17,846 --> 01:25:18,746
OK.

1558
01:25:22,617 --> 01:25:24,285
But you got to let me
figure it out on my own.

1559
01:25:24,385 --> 01:25:27,255
Even if I decide to do
something that you don't like.

1560
01:25:32,627 --> 01:25:35,029
I'll try, Paul.

1561
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:36,030

01:25:44,806 --> 01:25:45,707
Yeah?

I'm glad you're home.

Hey.

Hi.

1568
01:26:02,457 --> 01:26:03,858
How're you feeling?

1569
01:26:03,958 --> 01:26:05,827
Oh, better.

1570
01:26:05,927 --> 01:26:06,895
Better?

1571
01:26:06,995 --> 01:26:07,896
OK.

1572
01:26:48,069 --> 01:26:50,004
NINA: I found this
among mother's effects

1573
01:26:50,104 --> 01:26:52,974
and I debated whether to
send it to you or not.

1574
01:26:53,074 --> 01:26:54,676
Remember these two?

1575
01:26:54,776 --> 01:26:57,111
Braces was going to
be a famous artist

1576
01:26:57,212 --> 01:27:01,316
and Pigtails was going to
find a cure for stomach aches.

1577
01:27:01,416 --> 01:27:03,952
Abby, you asked me who I love.

1578
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:06,321
I won't apologize for
finding that with Paul,

1579
01:27:06,421 --> 01:27:10,959
but I do regret the hurt that
I caused you and your family.

1580
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:13,394
Perhaps one day you
will forgive me.

1581
01:27:13,494 --> 01:27:16,130
Perhaps one day
we'll speak again.

1582

copied and framed.
