1
00:00:00,533 --> 00:00:04,933
...to find the best ideas to
celebrate this very special day?

2
00:00:05,234 --> 00:00:07,234
Me! Me!

3
00:00:07,635 --> 00:00:11,635
Well, yesterday the staff
selected the winning idea

4
00:00:11,936 --> 00:00:15,336
and it came from this class.

5
00:00:16,737 --> 00:00:20,337
The winner is our own...

6
00:00:21,238 --> 00:00:24,138
Lucinda Embry.

7
00:00:26,639 --> 00:00:29,639
Come on, everyone.

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,340
We'll be closing our
dedication ceremony

9
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:37,741
with the burial
of the time capsule.

10
00:00:37,942 --> 00:00:40,942
What's the time capsule?

11
00:00:48,443 --> 00:00:51,443
This is a time capsule.

12
00:00:53,234 --> 00:00:57,434
Now I need you to put your
thinking caps on because I want

13
00:00:57,635 --> 00:01:02,035
each of you to draw what you think
the future is going to look like.

14
00:01:02,236 --> 00:01:06,236
Then we'll put the pictures in the
capsule, and 50 years from today,

15
00:01:06,437 --> 00:01:09,437
a group of children,
just like yourselves,

16
00:01:09,638 --> 00:01:12,638
will open it up to see
what you drew.

17
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:16,439
Doesn't that sound exciting?
-Yes, miss Taylor.

18
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,040
Lets begin.

19
00:01:22,241 --> 00:01:25,441
That is a lovely spaceship there.

20
00:01:31,042 --> 00:01:34,242
Time's up.
Everyone hand your work in.

21
00:01:34,443 --> 00:01:38,043
And make sure you write
your name on the envelope.

22
00:01:40,235 --> 00:01:43,456
Lucinda, you need
to finish up now.

23
00:01:47,377 --> 00:01:49,476
Oh, Lucinda.

24
00:01:49,677 --> 00:01:53,077
The assignment was
to draw a picture.

25
00:01:54,538 --> 00:01:57,505
This was your idea.

26
00:02:05,462 --> 00:02:08,875
Okay, I want you all
to finish, please...

27
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:16,635
Welcome to all our friends
and esteemed colleagues.

28
00:02:16,906 --> 00:02:21,551
We, the students and faculty
of William Dawes elementary,

29
00:02:22,106 --> 00:02:27,074
hereby bury this time capsule
in dedication of our new school.

30
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:30,677
And we charge our descendants

31
00:02:30,928 --> 00:02:35,169
to open this vault of history
50 years from today.

32
00:02:35,986 --> 00:02:39,850
To the future and
the promise that it holds.

33
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:27,471
Lucinda!

34
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:35,181
I'm certain that Lucinda is
simply playing somewhere...

35
00:03:36,184 --> 00:03:38,812
Please, help find her.

36
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:42,116
The cloakroom.
Check the cloakroom.

37
00:03:44,454 --> 00:03:46,537
Lucinda?

38
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:50,716
Lucinda!

39
00:04:09,772 --> 00:04:11,771
Lucinda!

40
00:04:13,922 --> 00:04:16,175
Oh my God!

41
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:24,519
Make them stop.
Please, make them stop.

42
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,405
Caleb! Take a look at this.

43
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,895
There you go.

44
00:06:41,427 --> 00:06:45,796
What is it? -Saturn's rings
await for your approval.

45
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:51,227
Has anyone found life on
other planets? -Not yet.

46
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:54,463
This is just us for now.

47
00:06:55,917 --> 00:06:59,546
Okay, then how manys that
might have life? -Well...

48
00:06:59,747 --> 00:07:03,747
If you count the number of stars
similar to our sun in this galaxy,

49
00:07:03,925 --> 00:07:07,922
then you factor in the probability
that they have Earth-like planets

50
00:07:08,123 --> 00:07:11,423
orbiting them... -There are
10 million possible worlds

51
00:07:11,624 --> 00:07:15,024
with 4 million mature enough
for life to evolve.

52
00:07:15,904 --> 00:07:20,125
Why do you even ask? -Just
making sure if you're listening.

53
00:07:21,146 --> 00:07:24,353
Where are you going?
-To watch that Discovery program.

54
00:07:24,554 --> 00:07:28,954
But it's dad's famous sunday night
hot dogs on the run... time!

55
00:07:29,565 --> 00:07:33,451
I can't consume that.
I've decided to become a vegetarian.

56
00:07:33,683 --> 00:07:37,644
When were you planning on telling
the guy who buys the groceries?

57
00:07:37,845 --> 00:07:41,645
Are you deaf?
I just told you now, dad.

58
00:07:53,778 --> 00:07:56,921
Off. -No, it's almost over.

59
00:07:57,122 --> 00:08:01,022
You're not gonna be able to
concentrate in class tomorrow.

60
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,910
We don't have a class tomorrow.
It's the 50th anniversary, remember?

61
00:08:06,592 --> 00:08:09,172
I remember.

62
00:08:13,196 --> 00:08:15,255
Caleb...

63
00:08:18,044 --> 00:08:21,245
When I said it was
just us out there...

64
00:08:21,477 --> 00:08:24,696
you know I was talking
about Space, right?

65
00:08:24,897 --> 00:08:29,097
I didn't mean Heaven or anything.
I'm sure wherever mom is...

66
00:08:29,298 --> 00:08:33,498
Dad... we don't even
believe in heaven.

67
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:38,024
I never said that, Caleb.

68
00:08:38,225 --> 00:08:42,225
I just said we can't know
for sure. That's all.

69
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:46,909
If you wanna believe,
you go ahead and believe. OK?

70
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,422
Okay. Bed time.

71
00:08:59,003 --> 00:09:03,332
Hey... you and me, together.

72
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:06,390
Forever.

73
00:09:09,102 --> 00:09:12,512
I love you.
-I love you too.

74
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:21,812
I'm gonna pose a topic
to get you thinking

75
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,880
along the right lines
for your term paper.

76
00:10:25,081 --> 00:10:28,681
It has a subject of randomness
vs determinism in the universe.

77
00:10:28,866 --> 00:10:31,344
Who is jumping in? Jessica.

78
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,232
Determinism says that occurences
in nature are causally-decided

79
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,393
by preceding events
or natural laws.

80
00:10:38,594 --> 00:10:41,794
That everything leading up to this
point has happened for a reason.

81
00:10:41,995 --> 00:10:45,395
That's right.
That's what determinism says.

82
00:10:48,866 --> 00:10:52,305
Spencer! Tell me something
about the sun.

83
00:10:52,606 --> 00:10:55,506
-It's hot.
-Elaborate.

84
00:10:55,787 --> 00:10:59,024
Temperature is about
10.000 degrees F on the surface.

85
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:02,225
27 million degrees at the core.
-Good.

86
00:11:02,637 --> 00:11:04,588
Stacey!

87
00:11:06,826 --> 00:11:09,889
A word or two
about the composition.

88
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,702
Mostly hydrogen, also helium.

89
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:16,314
With some carbon and nitrogen
turning there. -Excellent.

90
00:11:16,515 --> 00:11:20,515
Now, I want you to think about
the perfect set of circumstances

91
00:11:20,716 --> 00:11:25,116
that put this celestial
ball of fire at just...

92
00:11:27,417 --> 00:11:30,217
the correct distance

93
00:11:31,618 --> 00:11:35,218
from our little blue planet
for life to evolve.

94
00:11:35,419 --> 00:11:39,619
Making it possible for you to be
sitting here in this riveting lecture.

95
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,920
That's a nice thought, right?
Everything has a purpose.

96
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:47,521
An order to it.
Is determined.

97
00:11:48,922 --> 00:11:52,922
But then, there's the other
side of the argument.

98
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:56,440
The theory of randomness.

99
00:11:56,641 --> 00:12:00,441
Which says it's all
simply a coincidence.

100
00:12:00,942 --> 00:12:05,542
The very fact we exist is nothing
but the result of a complex,

101
00:12:05,796 --> 00:12:10,038
yet inevitable string
of chemical accidents

102
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:13,705
and biological mutations.

103
00:12:14,042 --> 00:12:17,273
There is no grand meaning.

104
00:12:19,409 --> 00:12:22,405
There's no purpose.

105
00:12:35,143 --> 00:12:38,143
What about you,
professor Koestler?

106
00:12:38,344 --> 00:12:41,944
-What?
-What do you believe?

107
00:12:44,345 --> 00:12:47,545
I think shit just happens.

108
00:12:49,546 --> 00:12:52,946
But that's me.
Class dismissed.

109
00:12:56,147 --> 00:13:00,047
That's some very heavy shit for
early morning by the sounds of it.

110
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:04,174
Since when does the cosmology
department honor my lectures?

111
00:13:04,353 --> 00:13:08,579
Since my esteemed colleague
in astrophysics owes me a latte.

112
00:13:10,814 --> 00:13:14,072
Er... what's on your
scientific mind today?

113
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,329
Do you remember Kim's little sister?
Ph double Ds... remember her?

114
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:21,930
Is it ethical to say things like
that about your sister in law?

115
00:13:22,131 --> 00:13:25,442
It's factual. It's peer reviewed.
It's like... anyway, whatever.

116
00:13:25,643 --> 00:13:27,843
She's in town this friday.
-Okay.

117
00:13:28,044 --> 00:13:31,444
And she thinks that you're intriguing
which I thought was code for "gay"

118
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:35,845
but apparently not cause she's asked
if you would join us for dinner.

119
00:13:37,146 --> 00:13:40,146
-I... I don't know.
-Oh, come on, John.

120
00:13:40,347 --> 00:13:43,747
Come on! You owe me for last
time you skipped out on me.

121
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,548
-Caleb was panicking...
-Yeah, look, I know.

122
00:13:46,749 --> 00:13:50,349
And the time before that he had
a sore throat. -Oh, no!

123
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:54,750
Damn it! Damn it! -What?
-Caleb's ceremony. I'm sorry, Phil.

124
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:59,051
Hey! Hey! Friday!
-I'll think about it.

125
00:14:26,091 --> 00:14:30,748
50 years ago the students and
faculty of William Dawes elementary

126
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:34,382
imagined what the
future might hold.

127
00:14:34,662 --> 00:14:37,697
Today we unveil their legacy.

128
00:14:37,946 --> 00:14:41,521
Now I'd like to introduce you
to someone very special.

129
00:14:41,722 --> 00:14:44,522
Miss Priscilla Taylor.

130
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:49,264
Since miss Taylor was there
for the original dedication,

131
00:14:49,527 --> 00:14:53,533
it's only fitting that we
have her do the honors today.

132
00:15:23,742 --> 00:15:28,423
You almost forgot again.
-Made it in time to hear you sing.

133
00:15:28,824 --> 00:15:32,624
You were the best one up there.
-You could not hear it.

134
00:15:32,825 --> 00:15:35,825
I could. I swear.

135
00:15:37,526 --> 00:15:40,326
Gotta go. It's starting!

136
00:15:40,527 --> 00:15:44,927
Easy, don't push it. -Everyone is
going to receive an envelope.

137
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:52,800
Open them gently now.
It's really old.

138
00:16:24,881 --> 00:16:27,282
<i>Lucinda Embry</i>

139
00:16:51,196 --> 00:16:54,037
Hey, what did you get?

140
00:16:54,238 --> 00:16:57,438
Boring! Everyone else
got a picture.

141
00:17:14,684 --> 00:17:17,539
Caleb, could you please
watch where you put this?

142
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,540
I don't want you
to lose another one.

143
00:17:21,094 --> 00:17:25,468
-It's making funny noises.
-Try turning the volume down.

144
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:32,929
Hey dad, remember that kid
Jason from soccer practice?

145
00:17:33,382 --> 00:17:36,193
He's having a sleepover
this weekend.

146
00:17:36,394 --> 00:17:39,494
And he was wondering if
I can come. -Sounds like fun.

147
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:41,727
They have a boat.

148
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:45,628
Jason's dad said he even might
take us out on the lake.

149
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:49,190
-I'll think about it.
-That means no.

150
00:17:49,389 --> 00:17:52,485
It means I'll think about it.

151
00:17:56,699 --> 00:17:59,029
What are you doing with this?

152
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,147
You're not supposed to bring this
home. It belongs to the school.

153
00:18:02,352 --> 00:18:04,479
But maybe it means something.

154
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:07,240
Like a map or sorta
something like that.

155
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:10,870
Yeah, that's good, I don't know,
but it's not ours to keep.

156
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:14,594
You'll return this as soon as you
get to school tomorrow. Got it?

157
00:18:14,831 --> 00:18:17,639
Now lets go. Bed time.

158
00:18:55,444 --> 00:18:57,470
<i>Good night, baby.</i>

159
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,435
Good night, mom.

160
00:20:59,034 --> 00:21:02,034
Nine eleven 01?

161
00:21:19,835 --> 00:21:26,235
In memory of the 2996 lives
that were lost that day.

162
00:21:27,836 --> 00:21:31,036
- 2996.

163
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:37,337
C'mon!

164
00:21:39,138 --> 00:21:41,938
What the hell is this?

165
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,831
Dad!

166
00:23:37,715 --> 00:23:40,753
Dad, we're gonna be late!

167
00:23:51,956 --> 00:23:54,994
Thanks for the ride, mr Koestler!

168
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:59,428
Dad, are you sick?
-I am fine.

169
00:23:59,785 --> 00:24:03,302
Don't you think you're acting
kinda awkward today?

170
00:24:03,603 --> 00:24:08,003
Am I awkward? I just had
a lot of work to do last night.

171
00:24:08,474 --> 00:24:11,650
Okay. Bye, dad!

172
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:14,051
Bye.

173
00:24:20,172 --> 00:24:23,437
Look at this. Look at the
numbers beside the dates.

174
00:24:23,664 --> 00:24:27,757
2996. That's how many people
died in the attacks that day.

175
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:31,041
Stay with me. I know how
this sounds, but I've matched

176
00:24:31,289 --> 00:24:34,352
these numbers to the dates
of every major global disaster

177
00:24:34,581 --> 00:24:37,358
for the last 50 years
in perfect sequence.

178
00:24:37,585 --> 00:24:41,404
Except for 3, and these events haven't
occured yet, starting with this one.

179
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:44,405
So, tomorrow,
somewhere on the planet,

180
00:24:44,606 --> 00:24:48,406
this number string predicts
that 81 people are gonna die...

181
00:24:48,651 --> 00:24:51,171
in some kind of tragedy.

182
00:24:51,372 --> 00:24:54,172
Whoa. Have you listened
to yourself? -I know.

183
00:24:54,373 --> 00:24:58,573
It sounds pretty crazy. -I know.
-I mean... even for you.

184
00:25:04,891 --> 00:25:07,728
What's this?
-Open it.

185
00:25:11,129 --> 00:25:13,929
Why are you showing me this?

186
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:18,130
The day Allison died in the fire.
It's on the list too.

187
00:25:18,831 --> 00:25:23,631
On the piece of paper that's been
buried in the ground for 5 decades.

188
00:25:24,395 --> 00:25:27,119
Can you explain that, Phil?

189
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,420
I was up all night going over this.
I went through that list

190
00:25:30,621 --> 00:25:33,897
again and again and I tried
to fault it. And I couldn't.

191
00:25:34,098 --> 00:25:38,098
-Maybe someone's playing a
really shitty joke. -Right! Right!

192
00:25:38,282 --> 00:25:41,335
Except I saw them dig it up!

193
00:25:41,911 --> 00:25:44,964
I watched them pull the capsule
out of the ground and hand

194
00:25:45,114 --> 00:25:48,529
that sealed envelope to my kid.
-OK. Let me ask you this then.

195
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:51,530
All these uncircled numbers?
What do they mean?

196
00:25:51,731 --> 00:25:55,731
I don't know yet. Maybe nothing...
-Maybe they all mean nothing.

197
00:25:55,932 --> 00:25:58,532
Phil, hey, can we just start over?

198
00:25:58,733 --> 00:26:02,133
I'm not saying that 81 people
are gonna die tomorrow, okay?

199
00:26:02,332 --> 00:26:05,424
I'm just trying to understand
why this is saying they will!

200
00:26:05,625 --> 00:26:08,025
Okay! It's spooky. I'll grant you,
it's more than spooky.

201
00:26:08,226 --> 00:26:10,226
But just step back, alright?

202
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,450
You have all these uncircled
numbers with no sequence to them.

203
00:26:13,651 --> 00:26:16,051
Numerology, Kabbalah,
Pythagorean cults...

204
00:26:16,252 --> 00:26:19,052
There are systems that
find meaning in numbers.

205
00:26:19,253 --> 00:26:21,653
But they are a dime a dozen. Why?

206
00:26:21,854 --> 00:26:25,854
Because people see
what they want to see in them.

207
00:26:26,955 --> 00:26:29,155
That's really what
you think I'm doing?

208
00:26:29,356 --> 00:26:32,956
Yeah, I think that losing Allison
has spun you off your axis a little.

209
00:26:33,157 --> 00:26:36,357
And I think it has clouded
your judgement.

210
00:26:39,713 --> 00:26:44,318
I'm just saying it has clouded
your judgement. Don't you think?

211
00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:49,619
Where are you going?
-Off campus.

212
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,180
Yes?

213
00:27:14,681 --> 00:27:19,681
You do remember her?
-Oh yes. I remember Lucinda.

214
00:27:22,381 --> 00:27:25,805
She was such a sad little girl.

215
00:27:33,186 --> 00:27:37,545
Would you like some iced tea?
-Oh, no, no, thank you.

216
00:27:39,846 --> 00:27:44,046
Do you remember the day your
students buried the time capsule?

217
00:27:44,247 --> 00:27:47,647
Oh yes! The children
were so excited.

218
00:27:47,848 --> 00:27:50,448
And what about Lucinda?

219
00:27:50,649 --> 00:27:53,849
Later that day
we couldn't find her.

220
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:57,450
She was hiding in the closet
under the gym.

221
00:27:57,651 --> 00:28:02,251
Scratching at the door with her
fingernails like some kind of animal.

222
00:28:02,452 --> 00:28:05,252
Scratching at the door?

223
00:28:05,853 --> 00:28:09,253
Why was she hiding?
-I'm not sure.

224
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:11,854
She was holding up the class.

225
00:28:12,055 --> 00:28:15,855
Writing all those silly numbers.
I had to hurry her along.

226
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:18,456
Then we found her.

227
00:28:18,657 --> 00:28:22,057
And I knew something had
frightened the poor dear.

228
00:28:22,258 --> 00:28:25,858
But we never could get her
to tell us what it was.

229
00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:30,859
Miss Taylor, my son got
Lucinda's time capsule message.

230
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:37,260
Do you remember this?
Is this what she wrote?

231
00:28:37,461 --> 00:28:41,861
Oh, professor, you are testing
an old woman's memory.

232
00:28:42,062 --> 00:28:46,462
Can you believe it's been 50 years?
-It's a long time.

233
00:28:53,202 --> 00:28:56,231
I believe that's it.

234
00:28:56,736 --> 00:29:01,162
Oh, how rude of me.
I never offered you a drink.

235
00:29:01,863 --> 00:29:06,163
Would you like some iced tea?
-No, thank you. I'm fine.

236
00:29:06,554 --> 00:29:09,237
I thought maybe I could meet her.

237
00:29:09,438 --> 00:29:14,138
I'm sorry. Lucinda passed away
several years ago.

238
00:29:17,628 --> 00:29:20,433
I said I'm Caleb Koestler's father.

239
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:24,034
I'm calling to find out the names
of the two janitors that pulled

240
00:29:24,235 --> 00:29:28,235
the time capsule out of the ground
yesterday at the ceremony.

241
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:54,057
I'm not sure I understand why
that would be a problem for you.

242
00:30:11,506 --> 00:30:13,497
Caleb!

243
00:30:16,321 --> 00:30:20,163
Who was that?
-I don't know. Just some guys.

244
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:24,627
-What did they give you?
-Just this. Kinda cool, isn't it?

245
00:30:29,497 --> 00:30:32,757
What did I say about
talking to strangers?

246
00:30:32,958 --> 00:30:35,958
Have you done your homework?
-I need 10 more minutes of practice.

247
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:39,437
I don't want to have to
ask you twice, Caleb.

248
00:31:01,256 --> 00:31:04,877
Hey, stranger! -At what age
do we learn to knock?

249
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:08,479
I said I was gonna drop by. On my
way to graveyard shift, remember?

250
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,480
Didn't you get my message?
-I've been busy.

251
00:31:11,681 --> 00:31:15,181
Do not play with my things.
-You're always busy.

252
00:31:15,382 --> 00:31:17,782
Yes! Yes.

253
00:31:20,381 --> 00:31:23,504
How's my nephew?
-He's become a vegetarian.

254
00:31:23,705 --> 00:31:26,505
-A what?  -Why? You got
a problem with that?

255
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:31,196
You're not feeding him dad's famous
sunday night hot dogs again, are you?

256
00:31:31,427 --> 00:31:34,196
You know, if you want someone
to take him off your hands

257
00:31:34,397 --> 00:31:37,397
for the evening so you can go out,
you know, like normal people do...

258
00:31:37,598 --> 00:31:39,998
I appreciate the offer,
but we're fine.

259
00:31:40,136 --> 00:31:43,742
And believe it or not, Caleb and I
have got a good thing going there.

260
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:47,143
So, you can report that
back to headquarters.

261
00:31:47,344 --> 00:31:50,244
Mom says hi.
So does dad.

262
00:31:50,679 --> 00:31:53,993
Grace! Don't.

263
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:58,667
I get that you don't like
being the son of a pastor.

264
00:31:58,868 --> 00:32:03,468
-I am the son of a pastor.
-That's fine. You're still his son.

265
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:06,525
Can't you let it go?
-Can't he?

266
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,422
He asks after you every time
I see you. He worries about you.

267
00:32:10,623 --> 00:32:14,223
-He said that?
-He doesn't have to. -Right.

268
00:32:15,369 --> 00:32:18,837
You're gonna have to speak
to him one day, you know.

269
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:22,962
This can't go on forever.
You know it's what Allison wanted.

270
00:32:23,248 --> 00:32:27,165
For Caleb to have a grandfather.
And vice versa.

271
00:32:29,567 --> 00:32:32,228
Okay. I'm going.
I'm going.

272
00:32:32,447 --> 00:32:34,887
By the way, Grace, how are you?
How's your life?

273
00:32:35,063 --> 00:32:37,627
What's going on for you?
Thank you, John, for asking.

274
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,876
I have to get up
early in the morning.

275
00:32:40,077 --> 00:32:43,677
What do you have going on?
I'll say a prayer. -Please...

276
00:32:44,278 --> 00:32:47,078
...don't. -Okay.

277
00:33:03,918 --> 00:33:07,531
<i>Experts say solar flairs
this weekend may interrupt</i>

278
00:33:07,732 --> 00:33:11,132

<i>The price of oil may

281

<i>An explosion on a soon to be
decommissioned oil rig</i>

283

3 hours before it was extiguished.</i>

284
00:33:38,762 --> 00:33:41,962
<i>Officials don't yet know the
exact cause of the explosion,</i>

285
00:33:42,163 --> 00:33:46,163
<i>but believe a malfunction in the
cooling system may've been at fault.</i>

286
00:33:47,464 --> 00:33:50,264
<i>Due to the prompt response

287
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:53,344

<i>It seems our indian summer is

293
00:34:27,631 --> 00:34:30,232
Hallo. -Dad, where are you?

294
00:34:30,433 --> 00:34:33,233
You're on the car pool
this afternoon.

295
00:34:33,581 --> 00:34:36,498
Caleb, I'm so sorry.

296
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:40,699
I'll pick you up in ten
minutes, okay? -Okay. Bye.

297
00:34:53,589 --> 00:34:56,623

Alternate routes:
no alternate routes available.

299
00:35:02,221 --> 00:35:05,818
This is Phil and Kim. We can't
get to the phone right now.

300
00:35:06,019 --> 00:35:09,619
Please leave the message.
-Hey, Phil, it's John.

301
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,720
I am sorry about yesterday.

302
00:35:14,921 --> 00:35:18,321
I kind of freaked out on you,
didn't I?

303
00:35:18,592 --> 00:35:22,743
Look, I'm not ready to meet anyone
in any kind of special way.

304
00:35:23,255 --> 00:35:27,475
But I would like to take you up
on your offer for dinner.

305
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:33,267
I think it would be good for me
to just get out of the house and...

306
00:35:55,067 --> 00:35:58,530
The uncircled numbers
are locations.

307
00:36:01,595 --> 00:36:04,195
This location.

308
00:36:30,302 --> 00:36:34,118
What's going on?
Do we get through or what?

309
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:37,840
Hi! Is everything okay?

310
00:36:38,041 --> 00:36:40,841
I'm sorry sir, but you need
to get back to your car.

311
00:36:41,042 --> 00:36:44,642
-Anybody hurt? -A couple of
injuries, but nothing serious.

312
00:36:46,644 --> 00:36:49,023
Get down!

313
00:37:29,768 --> 00:37:31,946
Hey! Hey!

314
00:38:00,881 --> 00:38:05,472
Help me! Please!
Help me!

315
00:38:06,373 --> 00:38:08,773
Help me! Please!

316
00:38:44,361 --> 00:38:48,236
-Are you okay, sir?
-Step back, sir. Step away.

317

321
00:39:37,273 --> 00:39:40,705
You didn't tell him anything?
-Of course not.

<i>First estimates put

323
00:39:44,678 --> 00:39:47,145
We need to talk.

324
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,666
I just...

325
00:39:51,867 --> 00:39:54,667
I just wanna sleep.

326
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,763
What happened, dad?
What's going on?

327
00:40:10,964 --> 00:40:14,164
My car broke down
on the highway.

328
00:40:22,161 --> 00:40:25,128
It's more than that, isn't it?

329
00:40:26,729 --> 00:40:29,329
I'm going to bed.

330
00:40:31,296 --> 00:40:34,133
Get your homework done.

331
00:40:34,634 --> 00:40:38,434
Then you should go to bed too.
No TV tonight.

332
00:40:38,835 --> 00:40:42,835
Why? I always watch an hour of TV.
-No more questions, Caleb.

333
00:40:43,036 --> 00:40:46,836
I can ask questions when you tell
me things that don't make sense.

334
00:40:47,018 --> 00:40:50,666
You won't let me play soccer,
you won't let me stay over at Jason's

335
00:40:50,857 --> 00:40:53,183
and now you won't tell me
what's going on

336
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:56,184
and why you're acting
so weird all the time?

337
00:40:56,447 --> 00:40:59,308
I'm not a kid anymore.

338
00:41:40,005 --> 00:41:42,694
Oh my God! John!

339
00:41:42,995 --> 00:41:45,395
You were there?

340
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:50,314
The date, the number of dead,
the GPS coordinates.

341
00:41:50,529 --> 00:41:53,920
Latitude and longitude.
Why didn't I see that?

342
00:41:54,138 --> 00:41:56,401
It wasn't a coincidence.

343
00:41:56,602 --> 00:42:00,002
I drove past at the exact moment
the prediction came true.

344
00:42:00,203 --> 00:42:04,003
It's not a coincidence.
-OK, John, I didn't say it was.

345
00:42:06,104 --> 00:42:09,304
So, what are we calling this?
Synchronicity?

346
00:42:09,505 --> 00:42:13,605
Two unrelated events, digging up
time capsule, plane crash...

347
00:42:13,806 --> 00:42:17,806
combine to create a significance
with the subject, you?

348
00:42:18,107 --> 00:42:21,107
I keep seeing their faces.

349
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:24,408
Burning...

350
00:42:26,209 --> 00:42:28,209
Oh, man...

351
00:42:29,929 --> 00:42:33,643
Okay, look. We are way beyond
the boundaries here, John.

352
00:42:33,844 --> 00:42:35,944
We don't have
a frame of reference.

353
00:42:36,176 --> 00:42:39,019
There could be multiple
meanings to consider.

354
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:41,820
There are two disasters left.

355
00:42:42,021 --> 00:42:44,421
What are you saying?

356
00:42:44,632 --> 00:42:49,868
Numbers are warnings
meant for me.

357
00:42:50,232 --> 00:42:53,527
They might just as easily be
a warning to stay away.

358
00:42:53,728 --> 00:42:56,528
You could've been killed today, John.
Caleb would've been orphan,

359
00:42:56,729 --> 00:42:59,229
and you wanna go put yourself
back in harm's way?

360
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:02,030
Two disasters left.

361
00:43:09,031 --> 00:43:11,631
Right now my scientific mind
is telling me

362
00:43:11,832 --> 00:43:14,632
to have nothing more
to do with this.

363
00:43:14,833 --> 00:43:17,633
And yours should too.

364
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:05,791
Caleb! It's all right.
-Dad!

365
00:46:06,092 --> 00:46:08,892
It's okay.
It's okay.

366
00:46:10,944 --> 00:46:13,770
It was just a bad dream.

367
00:46:15,371 --> 00:46:17,971
Just a bad dream.

368
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:32,602
Hey!

369
00:46:39,298 --> 00:46:41,067
Hey!

370
00:46:41,768 --> 00:46:44,768
You stay away from us, you hear?!

371
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:48,069
Want some of this?!

372
00:48:02,097 --> 00:48:05,110
Caleb, why don't you
check out the animals?

373
00:48:05,311 --> 00:48:08,111
I'll catch up with you, okay?
-Okay.

374
00:48:21,942 --> 00:48:25,904
Do you know that all wolves
are born deaf? -Really?

375
00:48:26,105 --> 00:48:28,105
Did you know that
when they get older,

376
00:48:28,315 --> 00:48:30,873
they can hear another wolf's
howl from ten miles away.

377
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:35,274
-Wow. How do you know that?
-I read it in National Geographic.

378
00:48:38,383 --> 00:48:40,991
Hi. -Hi.

379
00:48:41,392 --> 00:48:44,192
Is that your daughter?

380
00:48:44,693 --> 00:48:46,693
Yeah, why? -Why?

381
00:48:46,894 --> 00:48:49,294
Uh... that's my son.

382
00:48:49,495 --> 00:48:52,395
And they look like they are
already best friends.

383
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:55,626
Yeah, Abby is probably
telling him about the animals.

384
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:59,596
Even as a baby she was
completely fascinated with them.

385
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:04,298
Yeah, he's the same.
He likes extinct animals.

386
00:49:06,324 --> 00:49:08,483
I'm John.

387
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:12,754
Hi, Diana.
What are they doing now?

388
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,906
Caleb is showing her
something in sign language.

389
00:49:16,107 --> 00:49:19,507
-I'm sorry, I didn't realise...
-He's not.

390
00:49:19,912 --> 00:49:23,594
His sounds just...
get jumbled up sometimes.

391
00:49:24,395 --> 00:49:27,995
He has a hearing aid which
helps, but he's not deaf.

392
00:49:28,196 --> 00:49:31,396
He is an expert
in sign language.

393
00:49:32,443 --> 00:49:36,544
It's very hot in here.
Air conditioning must be out.

394
00:49:36,745 --> 00:49:40,345
Dad, can we get a drink?
-Can we get one too?

395
00:49:40,546 --> 00:49:43,946
Hey, would you and Abby
like to join us?

396
00:49:44,547 --> 00:49:47,247
Sure, that'd be nice.

397
00:49:47,448 --> 00:49:50,848
Abby, this is John.
-Hi. -Hey, Abby.

398
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:54,606
It can be tough sometimes,
cause, you know, I'm by myself.

399
00:49:54,807 --> 00:49:58,207
-I know how you feel.
-You're a single parent too?

400
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,128
Yeah.

401
00:50:00,329 --> 00:50:03,729
I left him years ago. He couldn't
keep his hands to himself

402
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:07,321
so I decided he couldn't
keep me to himself either.

403
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:10,966
Well, it is... it's his loss.

404
00:50:13,251 --> 00:50:16,257
And you? You're separated?

405
00:50:16,858 --> 00:50:18,858
Diana...

406
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,559
We didn't meet here by accident.

407
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:28,160
I need to talk to you
about something.

408
00:50:28,437 --> 00:50:32,237
Ask you something
about your mother.

409
00:50:34,256 --> 00:50:37,310
My mother?
What about my mother?

410
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:40,567
Did she have some kind of...

411
00:50:42,068 --> 00:50:45,268
...ability? -Ability?

412
00:50:46,379 --> 00:50:49,393
A gift of some kind?

413
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:53,867
Who are you? -Yeah, it's
awkward, you don't know me.

414
00:50:54,077 --> 00:50:57,123
I'm John Koestler, I teach
astrophysics at M.I.T.

415
00:50:57,324 --> 00:50:59,924
My son goes to
William Dawes elementary

416
00:51:00,125 --> 00:51:02,725
which is the same school
your mother went to.

417
00:51:02,926 --> 00:51:06,126
50 years ago, she put
this in a time capsule.

418
00:51:06,327 --> 00:51:08,927
It's a list of dates, events...

419
00:51:09,128 --> 00:51:12,628
...that, I think,
she believed would happen.

420
00:51:12,838 --> 00:51:15,048
Look, I don't what
any of this is about.

421
00:51:15,249 --> 00:51:19,249
I thought if I could talk to you or
your father... -My father is dead.

422
00:51:20,813 --> 00:51:23,482
I think it's possible
that there are people

423
00:51:23,683 --> 00:51:27,683
like your mother, Lucinda, who can
see things before they occur.

424
00:51:27,884 --> 00:51:30,884
Abby, we're leaving! Honey!

425
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:34,915
I followed on your mother's
predictions, and I watched

426
00:51:35,116 --> 00:51:37,616
81 people burn to death
in that plane crash yesterday.

427
00:51:37,817 --> 00:51:40,417
When she said it would happen.
Where she said it would happen.

428
00:51:40,618 --> 00:51:42,618
And there was nothing
I could do about it.

429
00:51:42,819 --> 00:51:45,419
She says 170 people will die
tomorrow in New York City.

430
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:48,420
And in 3 days time,
october 19th, 33 more.

431
00:51:48,621 --> 00:51:51,821
Stay away from me.
And my daughter.

432
00:51:52,518 --> 00:51:55,733
Abby! Lets go, honey. C'mon.

433
00:52:02,234 --> 00:52:04,934
Stay right there. Diana!

434
00:52:05,135 --> 00:52:07,935
Diana, I think this has
something to do with my son.

435
00:52:08,136 --> 00:52:10,736
I don't know how or why,
but I think he's in danger.

436
00:52:10,937 --> 00:52:14,137
So I'm asking you please,
please help us.

437
00:52:15,638 --> 00:52:17,838
I can't.

438
00:52:45,789 --> 00:52:49,589
<i>... possible terrorist plot. The
department of Homeland Security</i>

439
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:53,149
<i>raised the national threat
level from elevated to high,</i>

440
00:52:53,349 --> 00:52:56,549
<i>after intelligence report
suggested that an attack</i>

441
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:59,950
<i>on the major East Coast
city may be imminent.</i>

442
00:53:00,151 --> 00:53:03,351
<i>Police have urged citizens
to stay vigilant.</i>

443
00:53:38,786 --> 00:53:41,430
FBI New York.
How may I direct your call?

444
00:53:41,631 --> 00:53:43,531
The attack will
take place tomorrow

445
00:53:43,632 --> 00:53:45,632
at the corner of Lafayette
and Worth streets.

446
00:53:45,733 --> 00:53:48,133
Corner off the area after midnight.
Are you clear on that?

447
00:53:48,234 --> 00:53:50,234
Sir, let me pass you
through to our...

448
00:53:50,335 --> 00:53:53,735
Please! Do exactly as I say
or many people will die.

449
00:53:53,836 --> 00:53:56,436
This is not a crank call.

450
00:54:00,184 --> 00:54:03,927
You said you'd take him
off my hands.

451
00:54:29,009 --> 00:54:32,492
I know there's something
you're not telling me.

452
00:54:33,005 --> 00:54:35,932
Don't let him watch the news.

453
00:55:58,367 --> 00:56:01,773
Why hasn't this intersection
been sealed off? -Excuse me?

454
00:56:01,974 --> 00:56:04,974
I said why hasn't this
intersection been sealed off?

455
00:56:05,171 --> 00:56:07,258
Sir... please calm down.

456
00:56:07,459 --> 00:56:11,059
If you'll accompany me, we'll
get this matter taken care of.

457
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:13,360
Sir! Stop!

458
00:57:53,708 --> 00:57:56,715
Out of the way!
Let me through!

459
00:58:07,925 --> 00:58:10,160
Get off the train.
-Why? What is wrong?

460
00:58:10,339 --> 00:58:12,969
Just take the baby and get off.
-What's your problem, pal?

461
00:58:13,170 --> 00:58:15,570
Hold it right there, sir.

462
00:58:16,871 --> 00:58:19,271
Transit police!
I'm asking you to stop!

463
00:58:19,472 --> 00:58:22,672
That's him!
You have to stop him!

464
00:58:25,878 --> 00:58:29,063
Transit police!
Turn around!

465
00:58:30,413 --> 00:58:33,420
Now! Get your hands up!

466
00:58:34,621 --> 00:58:36,821
Please! Please, I won't
do it again, I promise.

467
00:58:37,022 --> 00:58:39,622
I'll give it back!
I'll give it back!

468
00:59:09,574 --> 00:59:12,577
Move back! Move back!

469
01:01:23,568 --> 01:01:26,768
<i>Federal Aviation Administration
official said that it's possible</i>

470
01:01:26,969 --> 01:01:29,969
<i>that an electrostatic burst
might have caused</i>

471
01:01:30,170 --> 01:01:33,170
<i>the Lexington air disaster
of two days ago.</i>

472
01:01:33,333 --> 01:01:36,664
<i>NOAA, the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration,</i>

473
01:01:36,865 --> 01:01:40,165
<i>remained silent tonight.
But with the devastating</i>

474
01:01:40,366 --> 01:01:43,766
<i>subway crash in Manhattan,
power cuts in Long Island...</i>

475
01:01:44,568 --> 01:01:49,568
Grace, I got held up by work.
I'll be over in 30 minutes.

476
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:54,840
No, I'm fine.
I'll see you in 30 minutes.

477
01:02:23,043 --> 01:02:25,643
Caleb, go inside.

478
01:02:27,391 --> 01:02:29,160
Hey! -Hey.

479
01:02:29,361 --> 01:02:32,561
Wanna check out the house?
-Sure.

480
01:02:39,162 --> 01:02:42,162
You said october 19th?

481
01:02:44,063 --> 01:02:47,863
My mother used to talk
about that day all the time.

482
01:02:50,987 --> 01:02:54,602
She said that was the day
I was gonna die.

483
01:03:07,204 --> 01:03:11,408
All my life I've had this
thing hanging over my head.

484
01:03:11,809 --> 01:03:14,209
And Abby's.

485
01:03:15,110 --> 01:03:19,310
I just don't believe that
anyone can predict my future.

486
01:03:21,611 --> 01:03:24,611
And what does it matter anyway?

487
01:03:25,981 --> 01:03:28,921
We all die in the end.

488
01:03:30,167 --> 01:03:33,938
I don't wanna know
what my future holds.

489
01:03:39,739 --> 01:03:44,539
Last year my wife was on
a business trip to Phoenix.

490
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:48,740
Couple of days before
my birthday, and...

491
01:03:49,258 --> 01:03:54,450
a fire started in her hotel
at four in the morning.

492
01:03:56,851 --> 01:04:00,351
The investigator said that
Allison died of smoke inhalation.

493
01:04:00,552 --> 01:04:02,952
Died in her sleep.

494
01:04:03,253 --> 01:04:06,653
She wouldn't have known
anything about it.

495
01:04:09,194 --> 01:04:13,537
While she was dying, I was
at home, in the front yard.

496
01:04:16,038 --> 01:04:19,238
I always thought
you're supposed to sense

497
01:04:19,439 --> 01:04:22,639
when the people you love
are in danger.

498
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:26,540
I didn't feel anything.

499
01:04:26,959 --> 01:04:29,234
Nothing.

500
01:04:31,235 --> 01:04:33,635
I was just...

501
01:04:34,236 --> 01:04:37,236
blowing leaves off the lawn.

502
01:04:37,837 --> 01:04:40,137
I'm so sorry, John.

503
01:04:40,438 --> 01:04:45,538
My point is that from
then on, I decided...

504
01:04:47,239 --> 01:04:50,839
that no one can know
what was coming.

505
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:53,640
And life is just a...

506
01:04:53,841 --> 01:04:57,641
string of random
accidents and mistakes.

507
01:04:59,942 --> 01:05:02,942
And then I got that list.

508
01:05:05,843 --> 01:05:09,443
If that had come to me
before Allison left,

509
01:05:09,644 --> 01:05:12,644
I would've saved her life.

510
01:05:15,474 --> 01:05:18,138
I need to know.

511
01:05:43,174 --> 01:05:45,672
It's still here.

512
01:06:12,313 --> 01:06:16,386
What's this?
Have you seen this?

513
01:06:18,503 --> 01:06:21,657
Abby used to do this sometimes.

514
01:06:22,158 --> 01:06:24,558
Write things backwards.

515
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:28,396
That last number.
I don't think it's 33.

516
01:06:28,697 --> 01:06:31,097
It's EE.

517
01:06:32,891 --> 01:06:37,081
EE... initials.
Someone she knew?

518
01:06:38,264 --> 01:06:40,784
I don't know.

519
01:07:03,694 --> 01:07:06,705
I was nine when she overdosed.

520
01:07:07,573 --> 01:07:11,382
The only time I ever came
in here was with my father.

521
01:07:12,059 --> 01:07:14,823
We identified her body.

522
01:07:15,024 --> 01:07:18,224
She willed the property
to me, but...

523
01:07:19,884 --> 01:07:23,311
I never came back
for any of her things.

524
01:07:39,436 --> 01:07:41,536
When I was little,

525
01:07:41,737 --> 01:07:45,537
my mother used to tell me
that she could hear voices.

526
01:07:46,038 --> 01:07:48,838
Whispering to her.

527
01:07:50,083 --> 01:07:53,013
Telling her horrible things.

528
01:07:53,978 --> 01:07:58,474
Then one day my dad came
and took me away from her.

529
01:07:59,855 --> 01:08:02,869
He said she was sick.

530
01:08:06,902 --> 01:08:10,582
She said she moved
out here to get ready.

531
01:08:12,061 --> 01:08:15,496
I never knew what
she meant by that.

532
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:23,477
I've made this for her
one Christmas.

533
01:08:27,854 --> 01:08:30,847
I never knew she kept it.

534
01:09:20,143 --> 01:09:23,691
She used to stare
at this picture for hours.

535
01:09:39,058 --> 01:09:42,084
That's where they found her.

536
01:09:43,606 --> 01:09:45,620
In there.

537
01:10:15,616 --> 01:10:18,303
Have you seen enough?

538
01:10:19,304 --> 01:10:22,304
Yeah. Okay, we'll go.

539
01:10:39,711 --> 01:10:42,064
Abby? Abby!

540
01:11:42,259 --> 01:11:45,326
EE isn't just one person.

541
01:11:51,605 --> 01:11:54,644
<i>everyone else</i>

542
01:12:01,589 --> 01:12:03,662
Abby, no!

543
01:12:14,226 --> 01:12:17,636
What? What?!
It's okay! It's okay.

544
01:12:17,937 --> 01:12:20,137
They were here.

545
01:12:20,373 --> 01:12:24,459
Who? Who was here, Caleb?
Did they hurt you?

546
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:28,409
No. They were talking to us.
-What did they say?

547
01:12:28,652 --> 01:12:32,386
I don't know.
They were all talking at once.

548
01:12:32,813 --> 01:12:36,994
They said we can go with them.
If we chose to.

549
01:12:38,656 --> 01:12:41,407
Who did? Abby, who?

550
01:12:42,008 --> 01:12:44,808
The whisper people.

551
01:13:00,233 --> 01:13:03,300
Hey! Lock the doors.

552
01:13:25,634 --> 01:13:28,659
What do you want with my son?

553
01:13:33,623 --> 01:13:36,405
Answer me!

554
01:14:05,002 --> 01:14:08,223
I just know they've been
following us for days.

555
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:12,127
I think someone's been
following me and Abby too.

556
01:14:20,767 --> 01:14:24,383
That's why she didn't write
any coordinates down

557
01:14:24,561 --> 01:14:28,365
after the final date. There isn't
a single location this time.

558
01:14:28,580 --> 01:14:33,635
Are you telling me that my mother
could see the end of everything?

559
01:14:35,426 --> 01:14:38,825
That we're all gonna
die tomorrow?

560
01:14:39,026 --> 01:14:42,426
She was disturbed, John.
She could've just...

561
01:14:43,407 --> 01:14:47,862
...made it all up.
-She's been right so far, Diana.

562
01:14:50,033 --> 01:14:52,990
About everything.

563
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:57,591
Abby is all I've got, John.

564
01:14:58,192 --> 01:15:01,792
I can't let anything
happen to her.

565
01:15:59,153 --> 01:16:02,277
Caleb, you really need to sleep.

566
01:16:06,109 --> 01:16:10,324
I can hear them whispering
to me sometimes like Abby can.

567
01:16:11,590 --> 01:16:14,592
Could Lucinda hear them too?

568
01:16:21,416 --> 01:16:24,458
Yeah I think she did, yes.

569
01:16:25,597 --> 01:16:28,632
Are me and Abby gonna die?

570
01:16:32,103 --> 01:16:36,570
No. I will never let
that happen, Caleb.

571
01:16:37,684 --> 01:16:40,723
Do you hear me? Never.

572
01:16:45,013 --> 01:16:48,267
You and me... together.
Forever.

573
01:17:04,058 --> 01:17:07,819
Abby, what do you like
to eat for breakfast?

574
01:17:08,220 --> 01:17:10,220
Abby?

575
01:17:12,621 --> 01:17:15,621
What are you doing, honey?

576
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:18,922
It's the sun.

577
01:17:23,316 --> 01:17:26,902
There's something I need to check.
Get Abby, you're coming with us.

578
01:17:27,103 --> 01:17:29,103
Caleb!

579
01:17:48,104 --> 01:17:51,104
Hey, John, what happened?

580
01:17:53,205 --> 01:17:54,805
Hey!

581
01:17:56,706 --> 01:17:59,506
Talk to me! What happened?
I've been calling you

582
01:17:59,707 --> 01:18:02,707
off the hook ever since
I've heard about the subway.

583
01:18:03,608 --> 01:18:05,608
John...

584
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:11,202
Do you remember that paper on
extrasolar activity I published?

585
01:18:11,403 --> 01:18:14,403
-Yeah, sure I remember.
-I found evidence of the series

586
01:18:14,604 --> 01:18:17,604
of superflairs from the
star in the Pleiades.

587
01:18:17,773 --> 01:18:20,817
Right. Readings were off the chart.

588
01:18:21,179 --> 01:18:24,267
We were both wrong.
The numbers are a warning,

589
01:18:24,468 --> 01:18:27,468
but not just to me or
any random group.

590
01:18:29,169 --> 01:18:32,169
They are a warning to everyone.

591
01:18:33,670 --> 01:18:37,670
Okay, you're officially scaring
the shit out of me right now.

592
01:18:39,071 --> 01:18:41,271
The superflair.

593
01:18:41,772 --> 01:18:44,372
In our own Solar System.

594
01:18:44,573 --> 01:18:48,973
100 microtesla wave of radiation
that will destroy our ozone layer.

595
01:18:49,371 --> 01:18:53,022
Killing every living organism
on the planet.

596
01:18:58,223 --> 01:19:01,023
We have to let everyone know.
We have to call the NOAA...

597
01:19:01,224 --> 01:19:04,824
They already know. The announcement
will come any time now.

598
01:19:20,101 --> 01:19:23,652
I thought there was some
purpose to all of this.

599
01:19:23,853 --> 01:19:27,853
Why did I get this prediction when
there's nothing I can do about it?

600
01:19:29,736 --> 01:19:33,385
How am I supposed to stop
the end of the world?

601
01:19:41,275 --> 01:19:45,104
Go home, Phil.
Be with Kim tonight.

602
01:20:00,625 --> 01:20:02,680
Diana...

603
01:20:04,208 --> 01:20:06,795
It's so stupid.

604
01:20:07,496 --> 01:20:11,496
I spent my whole life
knowing that she was right,

605
01:20:12,326 --> 01:20:15,553
and pretending that
she was insane.

606
01:20:18,990 --> 01:20:22,812
If we hide underground
we got a chance, don't we?

607
01:20:23,730 --> 01:20:25,999
It's possible.

608
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:28,800
I know some caves.

609
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:33,520
Off route 40, past Groton.
Hardly anyone knows about them.

610
01:20:33,740 --> 01:20:36,550
I used to play there as a child.

611
01:20:36,751 --> 01:20:39,551
We could try there, right?

612
01:20:39,725 --> 01:20:42,566
Okay. -Okay.

613
01:20:44,917 --> 01:20:47,475
Caleb, put some clothes and
shoes into your backpack.

614
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:50,676
Diana, load all the non-perishable
food, any water you can

615
01:20:50,877 --> 01:20:54,277
into the truck. Lets try to be
outta here in 10 minutes.

616
01:22:03,694 --> 01:22:06,686
Allison wanted me to call you.

617
01:22:07,287 --> 01:22:10,087
The day she left for Phoenix

618
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:13,746
she wanted me to promise her
that I'll call you.

619
01:22:14,370 --> 01:22:16,971
I know, John.

620
01:22:18,472 --> 01:22:21,472
We haven't spoken in so long.

621
01:22:21,706 --> 01:22:25,339
I don't really even
know why anymore.

622
01:22:28,367 --> 01:22:31,312
I need to tell you something.

623
01:22:31,713 --> 01:22:33,513
Yes?

624
01:22:34,014 --> 01:22:37,214
That sermon you preached
every year at Pentecost,

625
01:22:37,416 --> 01:22:41,658
about the gifts of the spirit?
One was the gift of prophecy.

626
01:22:42,459 --> 01:22:45,659
1 Corinthians 12.
Yes, I remember.

627
01:22:45,860 --> 01:22:49,060
The Church should
respect the prophets.

628
01:22:49,638 --> 01:22:52,451
I have a prophecy.

629
01:22:53,352 --> 01:22:56,752
It's about to be
proven accurate.

630
01:22:58,752 --> 01:23:02,700
I need you to respect it
and receive it as the truth.

631
01:23:03,601 --> 01:23:07,201
This heat we're experiencing
isn't gonna get better.

632
01:23:07,702 --> 01:23:11,302
It's gonna get worse.
Much worse.

633
01:23:13,133 --> 01:23:16,506
I need you to get mom and Grace,
and any supplies you can,

634
01:23:16,707 --> 01:23:20,107
and get below ground tonight.
The basement, the sewer,

635
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:24,182
just get as deep as you can
and as fast as you can.

636
01:23:26,173 --> 01:23:29,841
And that will keep us
safe from this heat?

637
01:23:32,142 --> 01:23:36,142
I don't know, dad.
But we have to try, right?

638
01:23:37,990 --> 01:23:40,980
I'm sorry, John, but I'm afraid
I'm not going anywhere

639
01:23:41,181 --> 01:23:44,181
tonight or any night.
I appreciate your concern,

640
01:23:44,382 --> 01:23:47,582
but if it is my time,
it's my time.

641
01:23:47,983 --> 01:23:51,183
I'm ready whenever
the good Lord calls me.

642
01:23:51,484 --> 01:23:54,084
And you... -Dad?

643
01:23:56,140 --> 01:23:58,531
John? -Dad!

644
01:24:12,875 --> 01:24:15,699
Caleb, lets go!

645
01:24:16,614 --> 01:24:18,592
Caleb?

646
01:24:21,736 --> 01:24:23,694
Caleb!

647
01:24:30,695 --> 01:24:32,695
Caleb!

648
01:24:35,096 --> 01:24:37,496
Caleb, stop!

649
01:24:42,097 --> 01:24:44,597
What were you doing?

650
01:24:44,798 --> 01:24:47,598
Did I do that?

651
01:24:56,624 --> 01:24:59,610
This isn't the way
to the highway.

652
01:25:04,485 --> 01:25:07,028
Everybody wait here.

653
01:25:08,529 --> 01:25:10,329
John!

654
01:25:13,230 --> 01:25:14,830
John!

655
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:53,533
John! Please!
Why are we back here?

656
01:25:57,893 --> 01:26:01,358
John, please. What are you doing?
We have to get to the caves.

657
01:26:01,559 --> 01:26:04,259
We're not going to the caves.

658
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:06,940
-What? -She knew the
coordinates for this last event.

659
01:26:07,041 --> 01:26:09,241
She tried to write them down.

660
01:26:09,342 --> 01:26:12,433
Teacher said she was
interrupted. Ran out of time.

661
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:15,697
So she scratched them
into this door.

662
01:26:15,900 --> 01:26:18,056
She tried to tell us
where to go.

663
01:26:18,257 --> 01:26:21,457
You're not making any sense. Look
at you. Look at what you're doing.

664
01:26:21,658 --> 01:26:24,258
The numbers are the key.
To everything.

665
01:26:24,484 --> 01:26:27,521
Please! Please, John,
we need to leave!

666
01:26:34,174 --> 01:26:38,003
We're taking my car. C'mon.
Lets go. Take your things with you.

667
01:26:41,133 --> 01:26:43,912
They are here.
They better be here.

668
01:26:44,559 --> 01:26:47,311
Throw them in the back.

669
01:26:50,410 --> 01:26:54,145
What about dad? -He is just
gonna finish what he's doing.

670
01:26:54,376 --> 01:26:58,263
He's gonna follow us. We're
getting a head start, okay?

671
01:27:20,094 --> 01:27:22,090
Diana!

672
01:27:31,579 --> 01:27:33,511
Caleb!

673
01:27:34,090 --> 01:27:36,019
Caleb!

674
01:27:41,079 --> 01:27:42,963
Caleb!

675
01:28:06,298 --> 01:28:08,711
Where are we going, mom?

676
01:28:08,912 --> 01:28:12,912
Are we hiding from the
whisper people? -Yes, my baby.

677
01:28:13,252 --> 01:28:16,147
They won't find us
where we're going.

678
01:28:16,348 --> 01:28:19,348
Mom, they know where we are.

679
01:28:19,949 --> 01:28:23,449
How do you know that?
-They told us so.

680
01:28:23,950 --> 01:28:26,150
You've seen them again?

681
01:28:26,351 --> 01:28:29,351
No. They just talk to us.

682
01:28:31,354 --> 01:28:34,605
How, Abby?
How do they talk to you?

683
01:28:34,845 --> 01:28:37,921
They whisper into our heads.

684
01:28:38,422 --> 01:28:40,422
Oh, God...

685
01:28:49,757 --> 01:28:52,531
I wanna call my dad.
-The phones are down!

686
01:28:52,740 --> 01:28:56,578
I promise he's right behind us.
We'll call him when we get there!

687
01:29:05,915 --> 01:29:08,545
Stay right here.

688
01:29:17,263 --> 01:29:19,533
Number 5.

689
01:29:23,962 --> 01:29:27,840
<i>This is an emergency
broadcast transmission.</i>

690
01:29:29,904 --> 01:29:32,258
<i>This is not a test.</i>

691
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:36,192
<i>This is an emergency
broadcast transmission.</i>

692
01:29:37,593 --> 01:29:39,593
Turn that up!

693
01:29:39,894 --> 01:29:41,994
<i>...lasted longer and
caused more damage</i>

694
01:29:42,095 --> 01:29:44,295
<i>to our infrastructure
than we originally thought.</i>

695
01:29:44,396 --> 01:29:47,096
<i>We're recommending that people
stay indoors until further notice.</i>

696
01:29:47,197 --> 01:29:49,497
<i>Get your pets inside,
stock up on extra water,</i>

697
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:53,032
<i>and if possible seek out
4-5 feet underground shelter.</i>

698
01:30:15,050 --> 01:30:17,592
<i>Where is the President?
-The President and his staff</i>

699
01:30:17,745 --> 01:30:20,834
<i>are currently to be transported
to a secure location.</i>

700
01:30:21,141 --> 01:30:22,966
Hello? -Dad!

701
01:30:23,167 --> 01:30:26,167
Caleb! Are you okay?
Tell me exactly where you are.

702
01:30:26,368 --> 01:30:29,768
We are at the gas station.
I don't know where.

703
01:30:33,669 --> 01:30:37,869
<i>The damage information regarding
the distructing power of flairs...</i>

704
01:30:42,746 --> 01:30:45,429
Caleb, get back to the car, now!

705
01:30:45,646 --> 01:30:48,394
John? -Where are you?
-We're in Westford.

706
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:51,282
I'm sorry, I had to do this
for Abby and for Caleb.

707
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:53,383
I'm taking them to the caves.

708
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:55,784
I've found the numbers!
They are the location

709
01:30:55,900 --> 01:30:58,285
of your mother's mobile home.
That's where we gotta go!

710
01:30:58,486 --> 01:31:01,586
-Don't do this to me. Please.
-I know how it sounds.

711
01:31:01,687 --> 01:31:03,487
You want us to head
towards the place

712
01:31:03,588 --> 01:31:05,388
where this is supposed to happen?
Are you insane?

713
01:31:05,489 --> 01:31:07,789
It's the kids we gotta take,
or we're all gonna die!

714
01:31:07,890 --> 01:31:10,090
Stay where you are.
I'll be right there.

715
01:31:10,191 --> 01:31:12,291
No! If we go to the caves,
we have a chance.

716
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:14,592
You said the sun
can't reach that far.

717
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:18,593
The caves won't save us!
Nothing can! The radiation

718
01:31:18,794 --> 01:31:22,094
will penetrate a mile into the
Earth's crust! Do you hear me?

719
01:31:22,295 --> 01:31:25,295
Our only chance is to go
where your mother told us to go!

720
01:31:25,496 --> 01:31:27,496
No! I don't believe you!

721
01:31:27,645 --> 01:31:30,415
I'm taking the children.
We have to save the children!

722
01:31:30,624 --> 01:31:33,837
That isn't your call, Diana.
Caleb is my son!

723
01:31:36,460 --> 01:31:40,325
Diana! Caleb!
Are you there?

724
01:31:47,468 --> 01:31:49,410
Abby!

725
01:31:51,098 --> 01:31:53,314
Abby!

726
01:31:55,399 --> 01:31:58,350
They took my daughter!

727
01:32:09,254 --> 01:32:11,087
Abby!

728
01:32:19,713 --> 01:32:22,122
Damn it!

729
01:32:58,316 --> 01:33:01,257
Where did she go?

730
01:33:47,767 --> 01:33:50,427
Same thing happened with Y2K.

731
01:33:50,628 --> 01:33:53,828
They are gonna wake up tomorrow
morning, feeling pretty stupid.

732
01:33:54,029 --> 01:33:56,629
20 minutes ago there was
a woman here, she was screaming!

733
01:33:56,760 --> 01:34:00,030
She was with a kid. He was on your
payphone. A nine year old kid!

734
01:34:00,240 --> 01:34:03,661
Some guy took the lady's car with
the kids inside. Drove right off.

735
01:34:03,862 --> 01:34:07,062
-The woman, where did she go?
-That way.

736
01:34:08,963 --> 01:34:12,163
Stop that!
You gotta pay for it!

737
01:34:52,536 --> 01:34:56,336
Where are the children?
-We can't help you now, sir.

738
01:35:09,583 --> 01:35:11,388
Charge.

739
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:13,990
Clear.

740
01:35:17,693 --> 01:35:19,910
Again. Clear.

741
01:35:27,330 --> 01:35:30,524
-You can call it.
-12 midnight, exactly.

742
01:35:31,725 --> 01:35:34,725
There's a man down.
We need help.

743
01:35:59,998 --> 01:36:02,055
Diana...

744
01:36:06,029 --> 01:36:08,429
I'm sorry.

745
01:38:14,860 --> 01:38:16,846
Caleb!

746
01:38:37,687 --> 01:38:40,049
Where is he?

747
01:38:40,693 --> 01:38:44,478
Where is Caleb?
I want my son!

748
01:38:45,764 --> 01:38:48,386
I want my son!

749
01:38:49,287 --> 01:38:50,887
Now!

750
01:38:51,088 --> 01:38:53,488
Dad, dont!

751
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:03,904
Are you hurt?
What did they do to you?

752
01:39:04,105 --> 01:39:06,705
It's okay, dad.
I'm okay.

753
01:39:06,906 --> 01:39:10,706
This is my friend.
They said that I can keep him.

754
01:39:17,622 --> 01:39:20,024
Caleb, I want you to come with me.
We're going now.

755
01:39:20,225 --> 01:39:23,025
But we have to go with them.

756
01:39:23,882 --> 01:39:26,427
They won't hurt us.

757
01:39:27,128 --> 01:39:29,928
Abby, are you okay?

758
01:39:30,455 --> 01:39:33,181
Your mom wanted to
be here, honey. -I know.

759
01:39:33,382 --> 01:39:36,482
The whisper people told me
that mommy is safe now.

760
01:39:36,683 --> 01:39:39,483
They've been protecting us
all along, dad.

761
01:39:39,684 --> 01:39:43,184
They sent a message ahead
of them. To prepare the way.

762
01:39:43,340 --> 01:39:46,307
And now they've come for us.

763
01:39:48,664 --> 01:39:51,472
Who are you?

764
01:40:45,232 --> 01:40:49,708
It's time to go, dad. They've
chosen us so we can start over.

765
01:40:49,935 --> 01:40:52,993
So everything can start over.

766
01:41:30,006 --> 01:41:33,876
What do you mean?
I don't understand!

767
01:41:37,577 --> 01:41:40,577
Why is he saying that, dad?

768
01:41:40,978 --> 01:41:42,778
What?

769
01:41:43,579 --> 01:41:46,379
What is he saying, Caleb?

770
01:41:46,580 --> 01:41:50,380
He's saying...
only the children must go.

771
01:41:51,581 --> 01:41:54,581
Those who heard the call.

772
01:41:58,482 --> 01:42:00,482
Please...

773
01:42:36,395 --> 01:42:40,795
I can't go with you, Caleb.
I can't go with you.

774
01:42:42,128 --> 01:42:45,073
But they've chosen us to go.

775
01:42:46,374 --> 01:42:49,374
They haven't chosen us, Caleb.

776
01:42:50,173 --> 01:42:53,391
They've chosen you.
Both of you.

777
01:42:56,582 --> 01:43:00,191
Caleb, you have to
take care of Abby now.

778
01:43:00,408 --> 01:43:03,449
You have to be strong for her.

779
01:43:06,350 --> 01:43:09,950
No. I don't wanna go
without you.

780
01:43:12,451 --> 01:43:16,451
They could've taken you
away from me, but they didn't.

781
01:43:16,652 --> 01:43:19,952
You have to make
this decision yourself.

782
01:43:20,153 --> 01:43:22,653
But you promised.

783
01:43:22,854 --> 01:43:25,954
You said that we'll be
together forever.

784
01:43:26,155 --> 01:43:28,455
We will be.
We will be.

785
01:43:28,656 --> 01:43:31,856
I'm not leaving you.
But you gotta go with them.

786
01:43:32,057 --> 01:43:35,257
You gotta go.
You gotta go with them.

787
01:43:35,458 --> 01:43:38,858
Listen to me, Caleb.
Stop, stop... listen to me.

788
01:43:39,059 --> 01:43:42,659
We're gonna be together.
We're all gonna be together.

789
01:43:42,860 --> 01:43:46,260
And mom is gonna be
with us too. I know it.

790
01:43:46,461 --> 01:43:49,861
I know that, Caleb.
I know it.

791
01:43:50,962 --> 01:43:54,162
Look... here, take this.

792
01:43:54,663 --> 01:43:57,863
Take this with you.

793
01:43:58,864 --> 01:44:02,264
One day you'll know
what it means.

794
01:44:09,207 --> 01:44:12,106
I love you, daddy.

795
01:50:26,888 --> 01:50:29,288
Where's Caleb?

796
01:50:29,789 --> 01:50:32,189
Caleb's safe.

797
01:50:32,890 --> 01:50:36,490
<i>We're going to stay on air
for as long as possible.</i>

798
01:50:36,791 --> 01:50:40,391
<i>All we can say is what we've
been repeating all morning.</i>

799
01:50:40,592 --> 01:50:43,992
<i>Get to any kind of
underground shelter.</i>

800
01:51:04,693 --> 01:51:07,193
This isn't the end, son.

801
01:51:07,594 --> 01:51:09,794
I know.
