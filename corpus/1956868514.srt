 come out here in these

  in the underwears.

193
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:55,775

  if I was a stripper,

194
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:56,943
I'd have long johns on.

00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,947
One way that I can tell,

196
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:04,409
the Max Bergman test
  for fake boobs.

 to get up right now
 and do me this favor.

First, we're all
going to go out

212
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,523
and get some
very bad junk food.

213
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,487
And then we're
going to go see

214
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,739
this really weird

216
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,245
No. I was just gonna
sit here and have
a nice, quiet lunch, okay?

Come on, baby.
Come on. Yeah.

Yeah.

that's Mr. Sun.

Yeah.

223
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:14,979
Yeah, it's nice.

224
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:17,774
And it's getting easier.

225
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,110
But I still miss him.

this place was?

It's a little strange,
I'll admit.

It's more than
a little strange.

over here.

have one on sale here.

a creepy face, huh?

272
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,632
Kind of reminds me
of my last boyfriend.

about it.

to grant your wishes.

292

about this rock?

it's kind of weird.

296
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:43,539
Well, yeah. I mean,
it's an ancient
carving, Hildy.

kind of weird.

Do you know how much work
went into this?

299
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,295
Please, it's got to be worth
more than I paid for it.

I had an impulse
to buy it.

but okay.

Well, if this fairy-tale thing
is real,

1250
01:17:22,096 --> 01:17:23,681
then all we got to do
is get this fire and this
chaff thing working,

1251
01:17:24,932 --> 01:17:26,225
say the chant before sunrise

1252
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:27,893
and we can save your baby.

1253
01:17:30,521 --> 01:17:31,605
But we don't know
what the chant is.

1254
01:17:33,524 --> 01:17:34,316
It's his name.

1255
01:17:37,027 --> 01:17:37,903
It's in the fairy tale, Max.

1256
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:41,240
