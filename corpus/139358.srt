1
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,979
They just moved out of the O.K. Corral
down by Fly's.

2
00:01:50,406 --> 00:01:52,612
Looks like Ike and Billy Clanton...

3
00:01:52,742 --> 00:01:56,407
the McLaurys, Billy Claiborne.
Maybe more.

4
00:02:06,256 --> 00:02:07,584
Let's go.

5
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:10,563
Morgan, take care of Mama for me.

6
00:03:11,075 --> 00:03:13,827
Keep your little brother out of trouble.

7
00:03:14,787 --> 00:03:17,705
Warren, I won't be seeing you for a while.

8
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:14,870
Where you headed, Wyatt?

9
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,620
Nowheres.

10
00:05:18,544 --> 00:05:21,878
- I thought you went to Logan.
- I changed my mind.

11
00:05:23,007 --> 00:05:24,549
Where you going, son?

12
00:05:27,512 --> 00:05:30,632
To town. I'm going to enlist, Pa.

13
00:05:31,474 --> 00:05:34,012
I want to fight the Rebs
with James and Virg.

14
00:05:34,477 --> 00:05:36,304
- I'm ready.
- Are you?

15
00:05:39,942 --> 00:05:43,809
You think your ma's ready?
I don't think she is.

16
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:49,741
Why'd you wait till I left
to take off, Wyatt...

17
00:05:50,286 --> 00:05:52,409
if you think it's the right thing?

18
00:05:59,295 --> 00:06:02,996
Virgil and James should be
coming on home any day soon now.

19
00:06:03,216 --> 00:06:05,754
Until they do, you know your job.

20
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,838
What was that? I didn't hear you.

21
00:06:11,267 --> 00:06:13,093
Eighty acres of corn.

22
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:17,012
You take on a job, you finish it.

23
00:06:17,106 --> 00:06:22,183
Any man who can't be depended on steady
isn't worth the trouble of having around.

24
00:06:22,695 --> 00:06:25,365
What makes you think
they're coming home soon, Pa?

25
00:06:25,448 --> 00:06:27,690
This war can't last forever.

26
00:06:28,076 --> 00:06:30,698
Besides, it's what I want to happen.

27
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,031
You know I got to whup you a bit.

28
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:46,276
Come on, Johnny Reb.

29
00:08:08,516 --> 00:08:09,714
Virgil?

30
00:08:25,493 --> 00:08:27,699
Look who got long and tall.

31
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:35,495
We didn't know you was coming.
Why didn't you send word?

32
00:08:35,587 --> 00:08:38,873
We didn't know ourselves,
so then we thought we'd just come on.

33
00:08:38,965 --> 00:08:40,839
Is James coming, too?

34
00:08:43,011 --> 00:08:45,585
James is right here with me, Wyatt.

35
00:08:58,695 --> 00:09:00,771
Don't shoot me now, you hear?

36
00:09:04,701 --> 00:09:05,899
James.

37
00:09:07,955 --> 00:09:10,956
- James, welcome home.
- Give us a hand here.

38
00:09:30,854 --> 00:09:32,514
Thank you, Lord.

39
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,998
Your mother thinks
there's something wrong with me.

40
00:09:55,088 --> 00:09:58,540
She says there's something in my blood
that won't allow me to stay put.

41
00:09:58,633 --> 00:10:00,341
She may be right.

42
00:10:00,677 --> 00:10:03,762
If she's lucky,
I haven't passed it on to you.

43
00:10:03,847 --> 00:10:05,258
We'll see.

44
00:10:05,724 --> 00:10:09,390
But for this family,
the time has come to move on again.

45
00:10:09,603 --> 00:10:13,352
To the west of here
is a vast expanse of untamed territory...

46
00:10:13,441 --> 00:10:16,395
full of wild Indians and countless dangers.

47
00:10:16,486 --> 00:10:20,353
But beyond that wilderness
lies a land with great promise...

48
00:10:20,448 --> 00:10:24,114
where civilization has flourished
for hundreds of years.

49
00:10:24,453 --> 00:10:27,786
We'll go to California
and see what we can make of that place.

50
00:10:27,873 --> 00:10:29,248
But why, Pa?

51
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,534
There are opportunities for lawyers...

52
00:10:31,627 --> 00:10:35,043
and rich land available
for people who know how to work.

53
00:10:35,131 --> 00:10:39,259
In California, Wyatt will study the law
and perhaps come to work with me.

54
00:10:39,343 --> 00:10:42,214
Maybe Morgan and Warren
will join our firm.

55
00:10:42,513 --> 00:10:46,843
I've already told Pa that I'm not going.
I wanna see what's available to me here.

56
00:10:47,477 --> 00:10:51,807
- I don't want to go, either.
- Martha's in love with Jimmy Jorgenson.

57
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,152
Good for you, Martha. He's a standup boy.

58
00:10:56,236 --> 00:10:59,522
His family knows what it means
to put down roots.

59
00:11:00,324 --> 00:11:03,907
Martha, if you don't want to go,
that's your decision.

60
00:11:04,787 --> 00:11:07,991
James has said he will join us,
which suits me fine.

61
00:11:08,082 --> 00:11:11,000
The closer you keep your family,
the better.

62
00:11:11,085 --> 00:11:15,249
They're the only ones you can rely on.
Remember this, all of you.

63
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,708
Nothing counts so much as blood.

64
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,423
The rest are just strangers.

65
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:34,359
Nicholas, I think
you've already told them that.

66
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,104
A hundred times.

67
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:40,361
- You can't hear it enough.
- I heard it a thousand times.

68
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,488
I heard you, Pa. Blood counts the most.

69
00:12:58,825 --> 00:13:01,151
I just want you to get these things
and get back.

70
00:13:01,244 --> 00:13:03,533
Don't talk to anyone
you don't have business with.

71
00:13:03,622 --> 00:13:08,498
- Don't worry. I'll keep an eye on him.
- That doesn't comfort me, Tom Chapman.

72
00:13:09,295 --> 00:13:10,753
Both of you use your heads.

73
00:13:12,256 --> 00:13:15,756
- Don't linger.
- Don't worry, Ma. We won't shame you.

74
00:13:23,351 --> 00:13:24,514
Giddap.

75
00:13:55,177 --> 00:13:57,715
See you later. Nice pitchfork.

76
00:13:59,223 --> 00:14:02,473
- I like this town, Wyatt.
- Why don't you give up?

77
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,847
Excuse me.

78
00:14:06,647 --> 00:14:09,601
I am not going in there.
Take a look, though.

79
00:14:10,693 --> 00:14:12,353
Come on! Go ahead!

80
00:14:17,951 --> 00:14:19,362
Stand back!

81
00:14:19,619 --> 00:14:21,778
I'll settle this right now!

82
00:15:26,357 --> 00:15:27,982
How you doing, Wyatt?

83
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,652
I'm okay, Pa.

84
00:15:35,951 --> 00:15:39,996
You know, this land is full of people
doing wicked things to each other.

85
00:15:40,956 --> 00:15:43,529
I ain't afraid. I like it out here.

86
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:48,128
I like how nothing much has been touched.

87
00:15:56,306 --> 00:15:58,879
I got to tell you something, Wyatt.

88
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:01,765
I told your brothers
when they went off to fight...

89
00:16:01,853 --> 00:16:04,309
and I suppose the time's come for you.

90
00:16:05,482 --> 00:16:07,641
You know I'm a man
that believes in the law.

91
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:12,064
After your family, it's about the only thing
you got to believe in.

92
00:16:12,948 --> 00:16:16,697
But there are plenty of men
who don't care about the law.

93
00:16:17,495 --> 00:16:22,406
Men who'll take part in all kinds of
viciousness and don't care who gets hurt.

94
00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:26,329
In fact, the more they get hurt, the better.

95
00:16:27,339 --> 00:16:31,716
When you find yourself in a fight
with such viciousness...

96
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,843
hit first if you can.

97
00:16:35,681 --> 00:16:38,848
And when you do hit, hit to kill.

98
00:16:43,522 --> 00:16:45,599
You'll know. Don't worry.

99
00:16:46,901 --> 00:16:49,439
You'll know when it comes to that.

100
00:16:54,784 --> 00:16:56,694
The Earps always know.

101
00:17:14,472 --> 00:17:17,142
Damn it, Wyatt, move this wagon!
They're catching up!

102
00:17:17,225 --> 00:17:20,060
- This is all we got, Dutch!
- Whip those nags!

103
00:17:41,084 --> 00:17:43,290
Giddap! Come on!

104
00:17:48,425 --> 00:17:50,418
Hold on, Dutch!

105
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:05,517
- They're on us!
- Shoot the horse.

106
00:18:05,735 --> 00:18:07,977
- What?
- Shoot the lead horse!

107
00:18:08,571 --> 00:18:10,860
You can hit a horse, can't you?

108
00:18:34,349 --> 00:18:35,843
Come on, boys.

109
00:18:44,818 --> 00:18:47,144
That horse never done nothing to me.

110
00:18:51,575 --> 00:18:54,909
You should be riding shotgun.
I've seen you shoot.

111
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,412
'Course, I can't handle a team like you.

112
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:04,744
Hell, we made it. That's the thing.

113
00:19:09,344 --> 00:19:11,586
You ever shoot a man, Dutch?

114
00:19:15,809 --> 00:19:19,475
Sure. I shot a few.
How do you think I got this job?

115
00:19:21,357 --> 00:19:23,149
How about yourself?

116
00:19:26,529 --> 00:19:27,609
No.

117
00:19:29,366 --> 00:19:31,405
Hope I never do, either.

118
00:19:32,828 --> 00:19:34,286
Good luck.

119
00:20:40,399 --> 00:20:43,401
If it ain't the sore-ass boys
back for another Fourth of July.

120
00:20:43,486 --> 00:20:44,649
Hey, Red!

121
00:20:44,737 --> 00:20:48,949
I hope you brought sugar in this load.
I ain't had no real sugar for a month.

122
00:20:49,034 --> 00:20:51,026
What's happening in this hellhole, Red?

123
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:53,445
You got any new ladies
up to my standards?

124
00:20:53,538 --> 00:20:56,456
I believe that there is a new one
just right for you, Dutch.

125
00:20:56,542 --> 00:21:00,919
She can stay awake two minutes at a time
and she favors them teeny little wangers.

126
00:21:01,005 --> 00:21:02,796
Look who's talking.

127
00:21:04,717 --> 00:21:07,967
Prize fight Sunday morning, Wyatt.
You gonna referee?

128
00:21:08,054 --> 00:21:11,803
I don't know. Last time,
some of the boys didn't like the decision.

129
00:21:11,891 --> 00:21:14,928
Sore losers. Hell with them. See you later.

130
00:21:37,043 --> 00:21:38,206
Fight!

131
00:21:39,045 --> 00:21:40,504
Get him, Shanssey!

132
00:21:41,131 --> 00:21:42,839
Keep your guard up, Shanssey.

133
00:21:42,924 --> 00:21:44,716
That's it. Take him down!

134
00:21:46,053 --> 00:21:47,880
Keep your hands off!

135
00:21:50,683 --> 00:21:53,174
One. Two.

136
00:21:53,269 --> 00:21:55,012
- Get up!
- Three.

137
00:21:55,855 --> 00:21:59,639
- You're hurt, Mr. Shanssey.
- No, I'm just getting started.

138
00:22:00,693 --> 00:22:03,231
- It's not worth it.
- Let me fight him.

139
00:22:03,571 --> 00:22:05,030
- Are you sure?
- Aye.

140
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,361
Fight.

141
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:27,668
Enough.

142
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,719
It's over!

143
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:36,350
God bless you, boy.

144
00:22:46,826 --> 00:22:47,988
Kid.

145
00:22:48,953 --> 00:22:52,287
You don't know a boxing ring
from a mule's asshole...

146
00:22:52,373 --> 00:22:54,247
and you twice cost me money.

147
00:22:55,585 --> 00:22:58,123
Sorry you didn't like the decision.

148
00:23:02,426 --> 00:23:04,751
Stay out. It's not your fight.

149
00:23:24,366 --> 00:23:25,908
Come on, Wyatt.

150
00:23:29,121 --> 00:23:32,905
- This is the damnedest game I ever saw.
- You can't get a spot now anyway.

151
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,167
So why don't you just come on up with me
for a while?

152
00:23:36,629 --> 00:23:39,464
I don't know if that would be
the right thing to do, Sally.

153
00:23:39,548 --> 00:23:41,837
See, I promised my heart to another.

154
00:23:41,926 --> 00:23:45,841
- Which girl? I'll fight her for you.
- It's no one here.

155
00:23:46,306 --> 00:23:49,093
She's back in Lamar, Missouri,
where my grandparents live.

156
00:23:49,476 --> 00:23:53,094
Missouri? Wyatt, she ain't gonna
help you tonight.

157
00:23:54,314 --> 00:23:56,852
I saw her three times back in '63.

158
00:23:58,235 --> 00:24:01,236
The third time she smiled at me just right.

159
00:24:03,824 --> 00:24:06,778
I guarantee you
she don't know what I know.

160
00:24:09,664 --> 00:24:13,662
I'll bet you're right about that,
unless things have changed in Lamar.

161
00:24:17,339 --> 00:24:21,917
Your boy Dutch is drunk and he's telling
everybody how you're gonna take Ed Ross.

162
00:24:22,177 --> 00:24:23,292
Damn!

163
00:24:25,639 --> 00:24:27,181
Who's Ed Ross?

164
00:24:27,683 --> 00:24:30,684
He's the guy who decked you
at the fight this morning.

165
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:35,681
I'd get a hold of Dutch before he starts
some real trouble for you, all right?

166
00:24:36,442 --> 00:24:38,234
- Thanks, Red.
- Sure.

167
00:24:40,196 --> 00:24:43,648
I know Ed Ross. He's bad business.

168
00:24:46,787 --> 00:24:48,329
I'd better find Dutch.

169
00:24:48,538 --> 00:24:52,323
- Gentlemen, that's it for me.
- You don't have to leave yet.

170
00:24:52,876 --> 00:24:54,750
- You done?
- All yours.

171
00:25:01,719 --> 00:25:03,344
How do you play this game, fellas?

172
00:25:03,429 --> 00:25:06,466
Simple, friend. Bet on the number
you think is the winner.

173
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:09,891
If you're betting for it to lose,
tap her with a penny on top.

174
00:25:10,353 --> 00:25:12,761
All bets on the spread. Comes the turn.

175
00:25:12,898 --> 00:25:14,475
The loser: Jack.

176
00:25:15,234 --> 00:25:16,977
The winner is ace.

177
00:25:18,404 --> 00:25:22,318
- I had a feeling this was a game for me.
- You're a winner, sir.

178
00:25:23,075 --> 00:25:25,993
Can we have a better time than this
upstairs?

179
00:25:26,078 --> 00:25:28,783
At least upstairs
I'd be making some money.

180
00:25:28,915 --> 00:25:30,077
Wyatt Earp!

181
00:25:46,392 --> 00:25:47,637
That's my name.

182
00:25:48,185 --> 00:25:51,851
That don't mean shit to me
or anybody else in this world.

183
00:25:51,939 --> 00:25:53,766
And it never will after this night.

184
00:25:54,066 --> 00:25:57,732
- Ed, this boy isn't worth your trouble.
- Shut up, Sally.

185
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:02,279
Earp, I hear you was looking for me
to make a fight.

186
00:26:03,994 --> 00:26:07,908
- So I thought I'd be easy to find.
- You heard wrong, mister.

187
00:26:08,957 --> 00:26:12,623
Only thing that's happened between us
is I got popped good.

188
00:26:12,711 --> 00:26:15,796
- I don't want to make a fight.
- Stop talking.

189
00:26:23,973 --> 00:26:25,053
Okay.

190
00:27:06,185 --> 00:27:08,758
This man wanted to shoot me down...

191
00:27:09,939 --> 00:27:11,481
over nothing!

192
00:27:14,986 --> 00:27:16,266
He lost.

193
00:27:20,158 --> 00:27:21,950
I'm taking his gun.

194
00:28:53,174 --> 00:28:54,288
Boom.

195
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,048
- Yes?
- Hello, Mrs. Sutherland.

196
00:29:37,262 --> 00:29:38,922
I don't expect you'll remember me...

197
00:29:39,014 --> 00:29:41,932
I know perfectly well who you are,
young man.

198
00:29:42,017 --> 00:29:45,102
Your grandmother told me
you were coming back to Lamar.

199
00:29:45,187 --> 00:29:48,307
Yes, ma'am.
I'm reading the law with Judge Earp.

200
00:29:50,026 --> 00:29:52,102
Are those flowers for me?

201
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:57,613
- Lf you'd like them, then, yes, they are.
- No, thanks.

202
00:29:58,535 --> 00:30:00,907
Let me see if Urilla is around.

203
00:30:01,788 --> 00:30:03,615
She might take them.

204
00:30:20,892 --> 00:30:22,303
Hello, Wyatt.

205
00:30:23,812 --> 00:30:25,354
Hello, Urilla.

206
00:30:28,942 --> 00:30:30,187
I brought you these.

207
00:30:32,488 --> 00:30:33,899
Thank you.

208
00:30:35,241 --> 00:30:37,946
I was glad to hear
you were coming back to town.

209
00:30:39,078 --> 00:30:41,700
- You were?
- Yes, I was.

210
00:30:45,502 --> 00:30:46,960
What's wrong?

211
00:30:48,171 --> 00:30:51,089
<i>Wrong? Nothing. It's...</i>

212
00:30:53,593 --> 00:30:55,052
What is it, Wyatt?

213
00:30:57,514 --> 00:31:00,052
I wasn't prepared
for how beautiful you are.

214
00:31:02,269 --> 00:31:04,642
Did you learn to talk that way out west?

215
00:31:19,997 --> 00:31:22,867
So you've come to Lamar
to study with your grandfather?

216
00:31:22,958 --> 00:31:24,073
Yes.

217
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:31,507
And to marry you.

218
00:31:34,137 --> 00:31:36,806
- Do you think it's as simple as that?
- No.

219
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:40,056
I know it will take a great effort
to win you.

220
00:31:41,686 --> 00:31:43,845
I know many men have tried.

221
00:31:44,606 --> 00:31:47,560
They failed because
you were meant for me.

222
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,278
But I'll succeed. I'll begin today.

223
00:32:00,456 --> 00:32:02,164
Is that your hat?

224
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:46,461
When do you expect
to begin your practice, Wyatt?

225
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:48,706
It may be a while yet, sir.

226
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:53,089
The judge says he's never seen anybody
make slower progress.

227
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,681
That's 'cause the law is so damn boring.

228
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:02,854
Erwin, not everyone has the aptitude
to be a blacksmith.

229
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,434
I don't know.

230
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:07,567
I think I could teach Wyatt here
a thing or two...

231
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:12,030
- if he was willing to work at it.
- I appreciate that, but I've found a job.

232
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:16,194
I thought I should make a living
while I continue my studies.

233
00:33:16,287 --> 00:33:18,410
What is it, Wyatt? What's the job?

234
00:33:19,207 --> 00:33:20,950
With the city police.

235
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:22,750
I'm to be a constable.

236
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:27,669
I figure a man who's about to
propose marriage better have a livelihood.

237
00:33:35,975 --> 00:33:38,217
When do you expect
this proposal to happen...

238
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:40,433
so we can all join in the crying?

239
00:33:40,896 --> 00:33:44,645
Daddy, Wyatt's proposed to me every day
since he's been back in town.

240
00:36:10,222 --> 00:36:13,722
...be faithful to him
as long as you both shall live?

241
00:36:13,976 --> 00:36:15,007
I do.

242
00:36:15,102 --> 00:36:17,391
May we have the ring, please?

243
00:36:21,818 --> 00:36:25,317
Place the ring
on the ring finger of her left hand...

244
00:36:25,572 --> 00:36:27,399
and repeat after me:

245
00:36:27,949 --> 00:36:29,906
- Urilla.
- "Urilla."

246
00:36:29,993 --> 00:36:32,200
With this ring, I thee wed.

247
00:36:32,537 --> 00:36:34,614
"With this ring, I thee wed."

248
00:36:34,706 --> 00:36:39,618
By the virtue of the authority vested in me
as a judge of the State of Missouri Court...

249
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:42,922
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

250
00:36:53,643 --> 00:36:56,644
Urilla, if it doesn't work out,
you know where to find me.

251
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:59,980
Wyatt, you give it your best shot.
You can do it.

252
00:37:00,067 --> 00:37:01,727
Make us proud, Wyatt.

253
00:37:25,969 --> 00:37:28,460
You've never seen such open space, Urilla.

254
00:37:30,182 --> 00:37:34,429
You can ride all day toward
some mountain and never even get close.

255
00:37:35,521 --> 00:37:38,012
There's practically nobody there.

256
00:37:38,649 --> 00:37:40,772
The few people that are...

257
00:37:41,361 --> 00:37:44,315
they just make up
whatever kind of life they want.

258
00:37:44,906 --> 00:37:46,780
What if you don't ever go back?

259
00:37:48,577 --> 00:37:50,819
That's all right. I seen it.

260
00:37:52,122 --> 00:37:55,408
I don't want to be the reason
that you're not happy.

261
00:37:56,961 --> 00:37:59,202
I could be happy anywhere with you.

262
00:37:59,797 --> 00:38:02,917
I don't care what job I have or where I live.

263
00:38:05,011 --> 00:38:07,632
What I care about is being with you.

264
00:39:31,937 --> 00:39:34,688
I thought this was only supposed
to happen in the morning.

265
00:39:34,773 --> 00:39:37,560
Please, Wyatt, let's not talk about it!

266
00:39:42,615 --> 00:39:44,524
Can't you let me be?

267
00:40:33,752 --> 00:40:35,412
You can't go in.

268
00:40:35,504 --> 00:40:38,042
- I want to see my girl.
- Esther, I can't allow it.

269
00:40:38,132 --> 00:40:40,172
Has something gone wrong
with the pregnancy?

270
00:40:40,259 --> 00:40:42,797
This has nothing to do with that.

271
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:44,429
It's typhoid.

272
00:40:44,514 --> 00:40:47,468
I'm going to have to quarantine the house.

273
00:40:47,726 --> 00:40:51,854
I can't let you go in, Esther.
It wouldn't be fair to the town.

274
00:42:24,078 --> 00:42:28,206
...our blessed Savior, who is himself
the resurrection and the life...

275
00:42:28,291 --> 00:42:32,585
has assured us that this body,
which we now commit to the ground...

276
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:37,416
dust to dust and ashes to ashes,
shall be raised in a perfect form...

277
00:42:37,592 --> 00:42:40,796
and united to the spirit
which has gone to God.

278
00:42:44,475 --> 00:42:46,432
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ...

279
00:42:46,519 --> 00:42:49,888
<i>and the love of God,
and the communion of the Holy Ghost...</i>

280
00:44:23,956 --> 00:44:25,948
What's the matter with you?

281
00:44:28,627 --> 00:44:31,747
What the hell? Come on. Back off.

282
00:44:35,885 --> 00:44:38,839
This ain't no hotel, you stinking bum.

283
00:44:41,766 --> 00:44:44,055
I can't tell you from the horse crap.

284
00:44:57,032 --> 00:44:58,277
Keep walking.

285
00:45:17,721 --> 00:45:19,263
Pardon me, sir.

286
00:45:20,683 --> 00:45:23,600
I wonder if you could spare a fella
the price of a meal.

287
00:45:23,686 --> 00:45:25,145
You're drunk.

288
00:45:27,231 --> 00:45:30,766
- No, sir, not at present.
- You reek of it and worse.

289
00:45:31,027 --> 00:45:33,981
I'm not in the business of helping drunks.

290
00:45:35,031 --> 00:45:36,940
You're correct, mister.

291
00:45:37,033 --> 00:45:41,197
I have done my share of drinking lately,
and I intend to correct my behavior.

292
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:43,447
<i>And it would be a good...</i>

293
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:47,993
It would be a good start
if you could lend me the price of a meal.

294
00:45:48,087 --> 00:45:50,625
There's no excuse for drunkenness.

295
00:45:50,923 --> 00:45:54,209
Or for the self-pity
which so often occasions it.

296
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,009
Yes, sir.

297
00:46:00,475 --> 00:46:03,559
If you really want a meal,
come with me, and I'll arrange it.

298
00:46:03,645 --> 00:46:05,803
But I won't give you money.

299
00:46:06,982 --> 00:46:09,058
Thank you, sir. I accept.

300
00:46:15,366 --> 00:46:19,779
I don't know if they'll serve you here.
Maybe they'll give you a meal in the back.

301
00:46:21,205 --> 00:46:22,450
Wait!

302
00:46:46,315 --> 00:46:49,233
You don't know what you're talking about!

303
00:47:25,649 --> 00:47:27,523
- You want a snort?
- No.

304
00:47:30,863 --> 00:47:33,188
- Bob?
- Coming.

305
00:47:43,167 --> 00:47:46,453
- Here. You can have the hat, too!
- Son of a bitch!

306
00:48:07,568 --> 00:48:09,193
That's a little better.

307
00:48:09,279 --> 00:48:13,111
Leastwise, I can take you in my bed
without you fouling it.

308
00:48:13,533 --> 00:48:17,198
- I'm sure you have your standards.
- Don't think I don't.

309
00:48:20,332 --> 00:48:23,037
- Pretty new at this, ain't you?
- What?

310
00:48:24,753 --> 00:48:26,876
Making a wreck of yourself.

311
00:48:32,345 --> 00:48:34,338
Won't last much longer.

312
00:48:35,098 --> 00:48:37,256
Gonna reform, are you, ace?

313
00:48:39,477 --> 00:48:42,597
Reckon I'll get myself shot dead
pretty soon.

314
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:57,657
Let's find out what's left of you.

315
00:48:59,707 --> 00:49:01,036
All right.

316
00:50:37,812 --> 00:50:38,891
Pa?

317
00:50:51,076 --> 00:50:52,535
Horse thief.

318
00:51:01,795 --> 00:51:05,046
- How did you find...
- Shut up! Do you want to die?

319
00:51:07,093 --> 00:51:10,592
That's what they do to horse thieves.
They hang them.

320
00:51:11,431 --> 00:51:13,055
I don't care...

321
00:51:15,352 --> 00:51:18,685
Do you think you're the first man
to lose someone?

322
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:22,775
That's what life is all about: Loss.

323
00:51:24,945 --> 00:51:28,528
But we don't use it as an excuse
to destroy ourselves.

324
00:51:29,116 --> 00:51:31,524
We go on. All of us.

325
00:51:35,581 --> 00:51:37,289
Even you, Wyatt.

326
00:51:42,839 --> 00:51:45,046
You're getting out of here.

327
00:51:55,019 --> 00:51:56,928
I gave them $500 bail.

328
00:51:57,772 --> 00:52:00,808
And I told them
I'd defend you at your trial.

329
00:52:04,445 --> 00:52:06,853
There's not gonna be any trial.

330
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:12,495
Because if they try you, they'll hang you.

331
00:52:12,663 --> 00:52:15,533
And if they catch you, they'll hang you.

332
00:52:18,711 --> 00:52:22,329
So you get on that horse, Wyatt,
and you ride.

333
00:52:23,090 --> 00:52:26,709
You keep riding
till you get out of Arkansas.

334
00:52:28,429 --> 00:52:30,885
And you don't come back here, ever.

335
00:54:46,785 --> 00:54:47,864
Ed.

336
00:54:57,588 --> 00:54:59,462
This could be the one.

337
00:55:02,677 --> 00:55:03,875
I got it.

338
00:55:06,264 --> 00:55:10,428
- How about some hot coffee?
- We serve warm whiskey, not hot coffee.

339
00:55:14,523 --> 00:55:17,061
Why don't you find me some coffee?

340
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:21,111
- Coffee she is.
- Excuse me, mister.

341
00:55:21,447 --> 00:55:25,575
We saw you come in with your wagon,
but we didn't see any skinners with you.

342
00:55:25,659 --> 00:55:27,403
That's 'cause there wasn't any.

343
00:55:28,037 --> 00:55:29,946
- Quit?
- Dead.

344
00:55:31,916 --> 00:55:34,372
That's as good as quit in my book.

345
00:55:37,797 --> 00:55:40,289
My brother and me
are looking for work as skinners.

346
00:55:40,926 --> 00:55:42,040
Bartender!

347
00:55:42,469 --> 00:55:45,589
My luck finally turned
with those big stinking bastards.

348
00:55:45,681 --> 00:55:47,305
Whiskey all around!

349
00:55:53,814 --> 00:55:56,436
- No, thanks.
- Wait a second, mister.

350
00:55:56,943 --> 00:55:59,897
Link Borland's buying, so drink up.

351
00:56:00,822 --> 00:56:02,779
Thanks, but I got some coffee coming.

352
00:56:03,491 --> 00:56:05,235
I don't do well on whiskey.

353
00:56:05,327 --> 00:56:08,577
If you'd pay for my coffee,
I'd be much obliged.

354
00:56:09,998 --> 00:56:11,161
Drink!

355
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:15,915
I've been in a real bad mood
for a couple of years...

356
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:18,330
so why don't you leave me alone?

357
00:56:23,429 --> 00:56:26,549
Drop your gun belt and go away.

358
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:50,617
- Got any experience?
- A little.

359
00:56:54,170 --> 00:56:57,337
It ain't too hard
shooting a bunch of dumb animals.

360
00:56:57,424 --> 00:56:59,417
Skinning's the ugly part.

361
00:56:59,509 --> 00:57:02,131
Our mother didn't raise no shirkers.

362
00:57:07,226 --> 00:57:11,010
- $25 apiece.
- Mister, that's a deal.

363
00:57:11,188 --> 00:57:12,896
My name is Ed Masterson.

364
00:57:13,232 --> 00:57:14,727
- This is my brother...
- Bat.

365
00:57:14,817 --> 00:57:17,355
- What?
- Bat Masterson.

366
00:57:18,571 --> 00:57:19,686
Bat?

367
00:57:21,908 --> 00:57:24,578
Okay, Bat. Wyatt Earp.

368
00:58:08,166 --> 00:58:11,749
- We got a brother named Jim, too.
- One brother?

369
00:58:13,588 --> 00:58:16,957
That's all you boys got?
One measly brother?

370
00:58:22,473 --> 00:58:24,761
Better than nothing, I guess.

371
00:58:26,852 --> 00:58:29,723
There's nothing counts so much as blood.

372
00:58:31,399 --> 00:58:33,890
Everybody else is just strangers.

373
00:58:34,152 --> 00:58:37,272
I guess we know where we stand
with Wyatt, don't we, Ed?

374
00:58:39,157 --> 00:58:43,784
You boys keep up that good skinning,
you just might get to be family yet.

375
00:58:44,746 --> 00:58:47,498
Of course, before you can be family...

376
00:58:48,292 --> 00:58:51,293
I'd have to know
where you got that name, Bat.

377
00:58:51,795 --> 00:58:53,171
It's just my name.

378
00:58:53,255 --> 00:58:56,790
I already told you 10 times, Wyatt.
They always called me that.

379
00:58:57,009 --> 00:58:58,385
Shut up, Ed.

380
00:58:58,553 --> 00:59:00,878
I tell you what, Ed.
You tell me his real name...

381
00:59:00,972 --> 00:59:02,881
I'll let you do some shooting tomorrow.

382
00:59:02,974 --> 00:59:07,054
- Bartholomew Masterson.
- Bartholomew?

383
00:59:12,609 --> 00:59:15,563
Why, Bat, that's a beautiful name.

384
00:59:17,364 --> 00:59:21,149
There's no reason to be ashamed
of a $25 handle like that.

385
00:59:22,203 --> 00:59:25,204
Maybe I'll just call you that all the time.

386
00:59:25,873 --> 00:59:27,072
Bartholomew.

387
01:00:26,897 --> 01:00:30,230
Sure you won't change your mind
and take another run at them?

388
01:00:30,317 --> 01:00:33,520
No, I'm gonna visit my brother James
over in Wichita.

389
01:00:33,612 --> 01:00:35,106
Meet his wife.

390
01:00:36,115 --> 01:00:38,902
See if I can't figure out a better way
to make a living...

391
01:00:38,993 --> 01:00:41,662
Than shooting a bunch of dumb animals.

392
01:00:41,746 --> 01:00:43,988
Don't hold much future, that's for sure.

393
01:00:44,082 --> 01:00:48,459
Not with every asshole in the territory
plugging away dawn till dusk.

394
01:00:48,837 --> 01:00:50,710
That's us, ain't it?

395
01:00:56,386 --> 01:00:57,964
Are all bets in?

396
01:00:58,055 --> 01:01:00,760
Next card, loser is six, winner is eight.

397
01:01:02,810 --> 01:01:05,182
- Just in time, sir.
- Thank you.

398
01:01:14,656 --> 01:01:16,447
That's good, Wyatt.

399
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:21,495
Gentlemen, hold your bets
for the new dealer.

400
01:01:22,497 --> 01:01:23,660
James.

401
01:01:29,296 --> 01:01:32,381
- How's it going?
- I'm getting the hang of it.

402
01:01:33,384 --> 01:01:35,092
I like that game.

403
01:01:35,595 --> 01:01:38,002
I wouldn't mind owning a place,
I'll tell you that.

404
01:01:38,097 --> 01:01:42,178
Last week you wanted to start
a stage line. Or was that the silver mine?

405
01:01:42,686 --> 01:01:44,477
Now we're gonna have our own saloon.

406
01:01:44,563 --> 01:01:48,098
All I know is there's not much future
in working for other people.

407
01:01:51,612 --> 01:01:52,857
Who knows, Wyatt?

408
01:01:52,946 --> 01:01:56,150
With what Bessie makes,
maybe we could get a bit together.

409
01:01:57,868 --> 01:01:58,900
Hi, there.

410
01:02:00,371 --> 01:02:01,913
She's my wife.

411
01:02:02,665 --> 01:02:05,037
You know I don't like counting on women.

412
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:08,413
Hell, I'd count on Bessie
ahead of any man I know.

413
01:02:10,841 --> 01:02:13,332
What you got against her, anyhow?

414
01:02:14,344 --> 01:02:18,045
- She's a whore, James.
- Yes, she is, Wyatt.

415
01:02:18,349 --> 01:02:20,341
And a hard-working one at that.

416
01:02:20,976 --> 01:02:22,519
What are you doing with her?

417
01:02:22,603 --> 01:02:24,643
Same thing everyone else
is doing with her.

418
01:02:24,730 --> 01:02:27,400
Only difference is she doesn't charge me.

419
01:02:27,483 --> 01:02:29,025
It doesn't bother you?

420
01:02:29,110 --> 01:02:33,025
That she doesn't charge me?
No, I'm rather fond of the arrangement.

421
01:02:33,114 --> 01:02:37,029
On a good day, I can even
get her to cook and clean a little.

422
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:41,621
- What was that? I didn't hear you.
- Nothing.

423
01:02:42,833 --> 01:02:46,416
Your arrangement doesn't bother you,
I guess it doesn't bother me.

424
01:02:47,004 --> 01:02:48,961
That's a big load off my mind.

425
01:02:49,048 --> 01:02:53,794
I've been losing sleep worrying whether
or not my arrangement bothered you.

426
01:03:12,948 --> 01:03:14,775
I got something for you!

427
01:03:18,204 --> 01:03:21,240
- Where are you, big man?
- Look out!

428
01:03:22,417 --> 01:03:23,792
What in tarnation?

429
01:03:28,256 --> 01:03:29,916
What the hell's going on here?

430
01:03:30,008 --> 01:03:32,760
Rowdy Dubbs is in the Iron Spike,
drunk and mad.

431
01:03:32,844 --> 01:03:34,505
We think he's already shot one man.

432
01:03:34,596 --> 01:03:36,969
Ford here has got to go in and get him.

433
01:03:39,643 --> 01:03:41,683
It's your job, isn't it?

434
01:03:44,565 --> 01:03:46,024
Not anymore.

435
01:03:46,692 --> 01:03:49,184
They don't pay me enough
to commit suicide.

436
01:03:52,782 --> 01:03:54,027
Give me.

437
01:04:09,050 --> 01:04:10,877
I see you out there!

438
01:04:22,522 --> 01:04:25,607
- My leg!
- Shut up.

439
01:04:36,537 --> 01:04:41,034
I don't see anybody else in there,
but maybe you'd better check around.

440
01:04:42,377 --> 01:04:46,161
- Young man, how'd you like a job?
- I got a job over at Pryor's dealing faro.

441
01:04:46,256 --> 01:04:47,715
$75 a month.

442
01:04:48,508 --> 01:04:50,252
I don't know. Being a deputy isn't...

443
01:04:50,344 --> 01:04:52,632
I'll make it $100,
but don't hold me up for more.

444
01:04:52,721 --> 01:04:53,884
$100?

445
01:04:55,766 --> 01:04:57,675
What's the Marshal gonna say?

446
01:04:57,768 --> 01:05:01,184
Marshal Meagher's
gonna like you just fine, Deputy.

447
01:06:14,516 --> 01:06:16,474
This could be trouble.

448
01:06:17,937 --> 01:06:20,344
Hold on, Mike. Don't shoot him.

449
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:27,611
- How are you, Wyatt?
- This is my no-good brother, Morgan.

450
01:06:27,822 --> 01:06:30,195
As opposed
to your no-good brother, James.

451
01:06:30,325 --> 01:06:32,614
- That's right.
- Morgan, meet Marshal Meagher.

452
01:06:33,745 --> 01:06:35,987
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

453
01:06:36,290 --> 01:06:38,329
Now take off those guns.

454
01:06:38,709 --> 01:06:41,165
- Do what?
- Take off your guns.

455
01:06:42,296 --> 01:06:43,838
Take them off.

456
01:06:45,758 --> 01:06:48,629
- When did you get to town?
- About an hour ago.

457
01:06:48,719 --> 01:06:52,800
- This boy would make one hell of a deputy.
- Might have an opening some time.

458
01:06:53,141 --> 01:06:55,714
If we do, he can put them back on.

459
01:06:57,479 --> 01:07:00,350
- It's really good to see you, Morgan.
- You, too, Wyatt.

460
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:02,350
Come on. I wanna show you something.

461
01:07:02,442 --> 01:07:04,435
- Go ahead.
- Come on!

462
01:07:07,865 --> 01:07:11,281
You're not gonna believe this.
Hold on to your hat.

463
01:07:12,453 --> 01:07:14,576
Or maybe just take it off.

464
01:07:16,207 --> 01:07:17,867
You decent, hon?

465
01:07:21,087 --> 01:07:22,498
Here he is.

466
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:30,843
Lou, this is him.

467
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:33,549
This is my big brother.

468
01:07:33,851 --> 01:07:36,971
- How do you do, ma'am?
- It's a pleasure to meet you, James.

469
01:07:37,396 --> 01:07:40,896
This is Wyatt, not James.
We'll find James later.

470
01:07:42,443 --> 01:07:45,812
Lou and I met in California
when I was out to see the folks.

471
01:07:45,905 --> 01:07:48,361
Isn't she the sweetest thing
you've ever seen?

472
01:07:49,534 --> 01:07:51,242
I believe she is.

473
01:08:26,532 --> 01:08:27,730
Ma'am.

474
01:08:42,591 --> 01:08:43,919
Don't shoot.

475
01:08:44,050 --> 01:08:47,135
If you miss me,
it'd destroy your reputation.

476
01:08:48,138 --> 01:08:49,965
Mister, I ain't in the mood.

477
01:08:51,809 --> 01:08:54,098
Larry Deger from Dodge City.

478
01:08:54,186 --> 01:08:57,140
People tell me you the man I'm looking for.

479
01:09:00,234 --> 01:09:04,232
We used to see 30,000 head of cattle
come through in a season.

480
01:09:04,739 --> 01:09:07,610
Hell, this year looks closer to 300,000.

481
01:09:07,993 --> 01:09:09,155
Think about it.

482
01:09:10,328 --> 01:09:12,570
- How much?
- $75 a month.

483
01:09:14,082 --> 01:09:18,709
- I'm making more than that here.
- Plus $2.50 for every arrest.

484
01:09:20,506 --> 01:09:22,664
I need help and lots of it.

485
01:09:23,342 --> 01:09:24,801
Things are already out of hand.

486
01:09:25,428 --> 01:09:28,215
- So you're looking for more than one?
- Hell, yes.

487
01:09:28,723 --> 01:09:30,550
You know anyone you can trust?

488
01:09:32,852 --> 01:09:34,644
I might know a few.

489
01:10:26,826 --> 01:10:28,369
I'm Wyatt Earp.

490
01:10:30,539 --> 01:10:31,654
Who?

491
01:10:32,916 --> 01:10:34,375
Wyatt Earp!

492
01:10:35,336 --> 01:10:37,494
Who the fuck is Wyatt Earp?

493
01:10:41,467 --> 01:10:43,792
It appears to be just some asshole.

494
01:10:47,098 --> 01:10:49,768
He's the asshole who enforces the law.

495
01:10:49,851 --> 01:10:52,425
- There ain't no law in Dodge City.
- That's right.

496
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:54,430
Not for the Clements crew.

497
01:10:54,856 --> 01:10:55,936
Stand down.

498
01:10:56,024 --> 01:10:58,978
We've got some new laws
since you boys were here.

499
01:10:59,069 --> 01:11:00,445
Tell them, Morgan.

500
01:11:01,030 --> 01:11:04,778
All visitors will check their guns
immediately upon arrival.

501
01:11:05,242 --> 01:11:06,653
That'll be the day.

502
01:11:06,744 --> 01:11:09,947
No discharge of firearms
within the city limits...

503
01:11:11,833 --> 01:11:14,240
except on the Fourth of July
and Christmas Day.

504
01:11:14,502 --> 01:11:16,625
No riding into the stores...

505
01:11:17,047 --> 01:11:20,332
saloons, the dance halls,
or the gambling houses.

506
01:11:21,385 --> 01:11:23,508
And no public intoxication.

507
01:11:24,012 --> 01:11:27,678
Mannen, what's that supposed to mean,
public intoxication?

508
01:11:28,392 --> 01:11:30,930
I think what he means is
we done enough talking.

509
01:11:33,439 --> 01:11:36,642
It means if you do anything
we don't much approve of...

510
01:11:36,734 --> 01:11:39,522
we got a legal right to shoot you down.

511
01:11:41,239 --> 01:11:43,232
You the one that's gonna try it?

512
01:11:50,833 --> 01:11:52,457
Mr. Clements, your men respect you.

513
01:11:52,543 --> 01:11:55,081
I don't wanna do anything
to take away from that.

514
01:11:55,546 --> 01:11:57,373
I'm sure you've earned it.

515
01:11:57,923 --> 01:12:00,165
So you and your boys
are welcome in Dodge City...

516
01:12:00,259 --> 01:12:02,501
as long as you obey the law.

517
01:12:04,722 --> 01:12:07,048
But if you don't wanna cooperate...

518
01:12:07,142 --> 01:12:09,929
I'll open you up right now
with this shotgun so wide...

519
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:12,807
your whole crew's gonna see
what you had for breakfast.

520
01:12:20,823 --> 01:12:24,655
After that it won't matter much
what happens next, will it?

521
01:12:39,468 --> 01:12:41,507
Give up your guns, boys.

522
01:12:41,803 --> 01:12:44,840
Only ones you need now
are sitting right between your legs.

523
01:13:08,540 --> 01:13:11,791
- The job don't pay a salary to start.
- No salary?

524
01:13:12,378 --> 01:13:14,785
Pays $2.50 for every arrest.

525
01:13:15,297 --> 01:13:18,085
Wyatt cleared, what, $1,000 last month?

526
01:13:18,175 --> 01:13:21,461
- Hell, how many is that?
- A lot.

527
01:13:25,433 --> 01:13:28,351
You've got yourself
a bit of a reputation, Wyatt.

528
01:13:29,312 --> 01:13:32,266
It's a tricky thing,
the reputation business, Bat.

529
01:13:32,607 --> 01:13:35,727
I gotta tell you,
not all a man hears is good.

530
01:13:35,819 --> 01:13:37,978
We heard about you
all the way over in Abilene.

531
01:13:38,072 --> 01:13:39,899
What're they saying?

532
01:13:40,157 --> 01:13:43,657
That people in Dodge are complaining
you're too quick to bash a man...

533
01:13:43,744 --> 01:13:45,951
just 'cause you don't like the way he looks.

534
01:13:47,331 --> 01:13:51,709
You just tell me what son of a bitch
is complaining, and I'll go bash him.

535
01:13:55,048 --> 01:13:58,963
Look, there are plenty of people
around here who like Wyatt.

536
01:13:59,803 --> 01:14:02,674
Let's see, there's me, there's Virgil...

537
01:14:03,265 --> 01:14:04,807
<i>there's me...</i>

538
01:14:13,109 --> 01:14:15,944
You might as well get broke in sometime.

539
01:14:16,029 --> 01:14:18,650
Why don't you boys handle this one?

540
01:14:19,908 --> 01:14:22,150
- Evening.
- I understand, let me tell you...

541
01:14:22,244 --> 01:14:23,489
Evening!

542
01:14:25,289 --> 01:14:28,243
Looks like you boys
have been doing some drinking.

543
01:14:28,333 --> 01:14:32,877
- Yeah? What makes you say that?
- Intuition, I guess.

544
01:14:32,963 --> 01:14:35,122
Anyway, we're glad
you're having a good time...

545
01:14:35,216 --> 01:14:39,795
but you know there is a city ordinance
against wearing firearms in town?

546
01:14:40,013 --> 01:14:43,713
- Says who?
- Says the law, that's who.

547
01:14:43,808 --> 01:14:46,726
Bat, you're being about as sociable
as an ulcerated molar.

548
01:14:46,811 --> 01:14:48,555
These boys, they don't...

549
01:14:50,607 --> 01:14:52,066
Shit, Wyatt!

550
01:14:56,864 --> 01:14:58,738
You talk too much, Ed.

551
01:15:00,409 --> 01:15:02,568
You didn't have to do that.

552
01:15:17,177 --> 01:15:20,095
<i>Well, I'll be a son of a bitch...</i>

553
01:15:31,901 --> 01:15:35,733
That fellow could've gone for his gun
after he saw you buffalo his friend.

554
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:37,938
Maybe.

555
01:15:39,659 --> 01:15:44,156
He was so drunk he couldn't hit
the ground with his hat in three tries.

556
01:15:46,166 --> 01:15:49,867
I'm just saying I believe
I could've talked those guns off him.

557
01:15:49,962 --> 01:15:52,797
If I were you,
I'd look for another line of work.

558
01:15:52,882 --> 01:15:54,293
Politics, maybe.

559
01:15:54,675 --> 01:15:58,459
Ed's got a different style is all, Wyatt.
People like it.

560
01:15:58,805 --> 01:16:01,510
You could get killed
in this line of work, Ed.

561
01:16:01,599 --> 01:16:03,639
You could get people around you killed.

562
01:16:03,727 --> 01:16:06,300
- We're just getting started.
- I know.

563
01:16:06,396 --> 01:16:10,975
When I hit that fellow, your first instinct
was to pull your weapon and cover me.

564
01:16:12,069 --> 01:16:13,896
This is a harsh land, Ed.

565
01:16:14,613 --> 01:16:16,653
It doesn't suffer fools.

566
01:16:17,616 --> 01:16:19,526
I'm not a fool, Wyatt.

567
01:16:20,328 --> 01:16:21,905
No, you're not.

568
01:16:22,538 --> 01:16:25,029
But you're not a deliberate man, Ed.

569
01:16:25,166 --> 01:16:27,373
I don't sense that about you.

570
01:16:27,752 --> 01:16:29,544
You're too affable.

571
01:16:53,488 --> 01:16:55,730
Don't do that, Wyatt. Please.

572
01:16:56,533 --> 01:16:59,368
- You know how I feel.
- I want to, Mattie.

573
01:17:00,954 --> 01:17:03,243
I could make you happy. I know I could.

574
01:17:03,832 --> 01:17:07,284
You just give me a chance.
I could be a wife to you.

575
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:14,505
I care for you, but I'm not gonna
tell you things that aren't true.

576
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:22,720
I don't wanna hurt you, Mattie,
but if seeing me causes you pain...

577
01:17:22,811 --> 01:17:24,056
No.

578
01:17:26,648 --> 01:17:28,107
We have time.

579
01:17:29,610 --> 01:17:32,943
I have to give you time, that's all.
You'll see.

580
01:17:34,573 --> 01:17:37,693
Only, don't leave money
on my dresser, please.

581
01:17:41,914 --> 01:17:44,999
Unless it's 'cause you wanna
take care of me.

582
01:17:45,752 --> 01:17:47,460
Is that how you mean it, Wyatt?

583
01:18:08,735 --> 01:18:11,689
Wyatt, the mayor's asked us
to come and get you.

584
01:18:12,071 --> 01:18:14,645
The mayor? Is something going on?

585
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:19,114
Some people are concerned about the way
you've been handling things.

586
01:18:22,875 --> 01:18:24,417
What do you think, Ed?

587
01:18:26,712 --> 01:18:28,705
There's been some complaints.

588
01:18:28,798 --> 01:18:31,289
From some in jail, maybe,
not from citizens.

589
01:18:31,384 --> 01:18:32,878
Some of them, too.

590
01:18:33,678 --> 01:18:37,011
I'm just saying this out of friendship,
so you know.

591
01:18:37,515 --> 01:18:40,765
All I know is the mayor wants to see you.
He asked us to find you.

592
01:18:40,852 --> 01:18:42,097
That's what we did.

593
01:19:21,020 --> 01:19:24,852
Donovan went all the way
to a title shot after that bout.

594
01:19:25,817 --> 01:19:30,146
Don't know what shape I'd be in today
if you hadn't stopped that fight.

595
01:19:30,697 --> 01:19:31,859
Drink?

596
01:19:36,077 --> 01:19:38,284
What are you doing in these parts, Wyatt?

597
01:19:38,372 --> 01:19:41,492
I thought you was
the Deputy Marshal in Dodge.

598
01:19:42,376 --> 01:19:43,787
I was...

599
01:19:45,296 --> 01:19:48,499
till the city fathers
forgot to renew my contract.

600
01:19:48,758 --> 01:19:50,418
Too much of a hard-ass, I guess.

601
01:19:51,052 --> 01:19:53,377
You are. Everybody knows that.

602
01:19:54,138 --> 01:19:57,389
- Who replaced you?
- A fellow named Masterson.

603
01:19:57,642 --> 01:19:59,053
Bat Masterson?

604
01:20:00,770 --> 01:20:02,514
No, his brother Ed.

605
01:20:02,647 --> 01:20:05,565
- What's he like?
- He's affable.

606
01:20:06,485 --> 01:20:07,979
Very affable.

607
01:20:08,570 --> 01:20:09,769
What are you up to?

608
01:20:13,451 --> 01:20:15,443
I'm doing a job for the railroad.

609
01:20:15,536 --> 01:20:18,110
Looking for a fellow,
name of Dave Rudabaugh. Know him?

610
01:20:18,206 --> 01:20:21,207
- Yeah.
- I heard he might be headed this way.

611
01:20:21,292 --> 01:20:25,705
He come through here all right,
but where he went I couldn't tell you.

612
01:20:26,339 --> 01:20:27,999
What'd he do?

613
01:20:28,258 --> 01:20:31,710
He robbed the Santa Fe train three times,
looks like.

614
01:20:33,138 --> 01:20:35,760
There is somebody
who might know something.

615
01:20:36,433 --> 01:20:39,968
If he does, he'll probably tell you.
He hates Rudabaugh.

616
01:20:40,062 --> 01:20:43,348
- His name's Doc Holliday.
- He's a killer, isn't he?

617
01:20:43,774 --> 01:20:45,435
He's killed some.

618
01:20:46,945 --> 01:20:50,693
He owes me a couple of favors
and he's as good as his word.

619
01:20:51,449 --> 01:20:53,572
He's dying of tuberculosis.

620
01:20:54,619 --> 01:20:57,620
He travels with a whore
named Big Nose Kate...

621
01:20:58,415 --> 01:20:59,744
but he's not her pimp.

622
01:21:01,627 --> 01:21:03,335
You take me to him?

623
01:21:30,574 --> 01:21:33,492
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine,
Wyatt Earp.

624
01:21:35,162 --> 01:21:39,576
I've heard that name somewhere.
Don't know where, but it wasn't good.

625
01:21:42,462 --> 01:21:43,742
Mind if we sit down?

626
01:21:54,058 --> 01:21:56,383
I'm looking for Dave Rudabaugh.

627
01:21:57,645 --> 01:22:00,765
There's a reward for information
about him leading to his arrest.

628
01:22:00,856 --> 01:22:02,481
Are you a lawman?

629
01:22:03,818 --> 01:22:07,946
You are not wearing a badge.
Are you ashamed of your profession?

630
01:22:08,364 --> 01:22:11,235
I myself was a dentist.
I was proud to be a dentist.

631
01:22:11,326 --> 01:22:14,446
I did not hide the fact that I was a dentist.

632
01:22:14,579 --> 01:22:16,453
How are your teeth, Wyatt Earp?

633
01:22:17,708 --> 01:22:19,202
They're working all right.

634
01:22:19,293 --> 01:22:22,496
Take good care of them.
They cannot be replaced.

635
01:22:23,881 --> 01:22:28,792
I'm no longer a dentist.
I'm a sporting man. That's my work now.

636
01:22:29,846 --> 01:22:34,175
In Georgia, we were taught
that a man should take pride in his work.

637
01:22:35,477 --> 01:22:37,849
Have you ever been to Georgia?

638
01:22:39,898 --> 01:22:41,891
Beautiful state, Georgia.

639
01:22:42,442 --> 01:22:45,942
Very green. I was forced to leave Georgia.

640
01:22:46,488 --> 01:22:49,240
I fear that I will never see it again.

641
01:22:50,534 --> 01:22:51,863
I'm sorry.

642
01:23:18,773 --> 01:23:21,062
Do you believe in friendship?

643
01:23:25,572 --> 01:23:26,947
So do I.

644
01:23:27,782 --> 01:23:29,656
Do you have many friends?

645
01:23:33,538 --> 01:23:37,121
John here has been a friend to me
when most men were not.

646
01:23:37,459 --> 01:23:40,745
Dave Rudabaugh is an ignorant scoundrel.

647
01:23:40,838 --> 01:23:43,376
I disapprove of his very existence.

648
01:23:43,799 --> 01:23:47,299
I considered ending it myself
on several occasions...

649
01:23:48,763 --> 01:23:51,515
but self-control got the better of me.

650
01:23:52,892 --> 01:23:55,810
Besides, I'm a sporting man...

651
01:23:56,646 --> 01:23:58,141
not a killer.

652
01:24:12,663 --> 01:24:15,415
Tell me about the reward, Wyatt Earp.

653
01:24:16,793 --> 01:24:21,206
You'd be doing me a favor
if you would call me either Wyatt or Earp.

654
01:24:22,757 --> 01:24:24,086
Not both.

655
01:24:25,594 --> 01:24:26,969
All right.

656
01:24:29,181 --> 01:24:30,344
Wyatt.

657
01:24:34,270 --> 01:24:35,681
Call me Doc.

658
01:24:51,455 --> 01:24:53,032
Hey, bartender.

659
01:25:08,556 --> 01:25:10,098
Howdy, friend.

660
01:25:11,309 --> 01:25:12,554
You ain't my friend.

661
01:25:13,186 --> 01:25:15,226
True enough, but I am the law here...

662
01:25:15,313 --> 01:25:19,014
and the law says that you can't wear
the gun in town. Hand it over.

663
01:25:20,110 --> 01:25:21,688
What if I don't?

664
01:25:23,113 --> 01:25:27,526
I'll have to take it away from you.
You'll go to jail. You'll miss the party.

665
01:25:27,618 --> 01:25:29,611
You don't want that, now, do you?

666
01:25:32,165 --> 01:25:33,707
Give it to me!

667
01:25:43,176 --> 01:25:45,335
Don't give it back till they leave town.

668
01:25:47,264 --> 01:25:48,639
Thank you.

669
01:26:00,778 --> 01:26:04,230
- I'll sure do that.
- Okay, good. You have a good night.

670
01:26:35,399 --> 01:26:38,982
- That one laying over there.
- I didn't see who it was.

671
01:26:58,006 --> 01:26:59,500
Bat, I'm shot.

672
01:27:14,732 --> 01:27:16,013
Oh, God.

673
01:28:36,402 --> 01:28:37,731
Let's go.

674
01:29:06,059 --> 01:29:07,968
My name is Wyatt Earp.

675
01:29:08,979 --> 01:29:10,639
It all ends now!

676
01:29:29,170 --> 01:29:30,581
Hello, Doc.

677
01:29:32,173 --> 01:29:35,459
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.
Kate Elder.

678
01:29:36,136 --> 01:29:39,386
- Nice to meet you, Miss Elder.
- Charmed, I'm sure.

679
01:29:39,973 --> 01:29:42,974
You can call me Big Nose Kate.
Everybody else does.

680
01:29:45,562 --> 01:29:47,851
No, it's not that big.

681
01:29:48,315 --> 01:29:52,313
- All kinds of reasons a person gets a name.
- I couldn't agree more, ma'am.

682
01:29:52,778 --> 01:29:56,823
This is my brother Virgil.
Bat Masterson, Doc Holliday.

683
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:02,494
You're the man that killed
Sgt. King in Sweetwater.

684
01:30:02,622 --> 01:30:05,078
Got you in the leg, I understand.

685
01:30:06,376 --> 01:30:10,706
My congratulations to you, sir.
King was a skunk of the first order.

686
01:30:12,674 --> 01:30:16,293
I wish you'd got him
before he shot poor Molly Brennan.

687
01:30:17,012 --> 01:30:20,097
- She was a sweet girl.
- Yes, she was, ma'am.

688
01:30:20,558 --> 01:30:24,805
- So what brings you to Dodge City, Doc?
- I guess I missed you, Wyatt.

689
01:30:24,938 --> 01:30:27,061
This is where the money is.

690
01:30:28,066 --> 01:30:29,145
Anything else?

691
01:30:30,318 --> 01:30:32,062
Perhaps you've heard.

692
01:30:32,154 --> 01:30:34,858
We had an unfortunate incident
in Fort Griffin...

693
01:30:34,990 --> 01:30:37,611
entirely beyond our control.

694
01:30:38,744 --> 01:30:41,200
It seemed a good time to move on.

695
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:45,911
I hope we won't have
anything unfortunate happen in Dodge.

696
01:30:46,002 --> 01:30:47,911
Likewise, I'm sure.

697
01:30:48,337 --> 01:30:52,122
I'll be checking my gun
as soon as we find a suitable hotel.

698
01:30:52,675 --> 01:30:55,712
I look forward
to more civilized surroundings.

699
01:30:56,054 --> 01:30:57,429
Gentlemen.

700
01:31:06,607 --> 01:31:09,525
Maybe he ought to check his knife, too.

701
01:31:09,610 --> 01:31:13,525
I heard he cut that man in Texas
from his belly to his dick.

702
01:31:27,713 --> 01:31:28,875
Bye.

703
01:31:40,935 --> 01:31:45,431
I don't know what you want, Wyatt.
This setup seems pretty sweet to me.

704
01:31:45,607 --> 01:31:49,142
We're making good money. We might get
a piece of the Alhambra Faro Bank.

705
01:31:49,236 --> 01:31:52,819
Virgil, there's never been a man
that got rich working on a salary.

706
01:31:52,906 --> 01:31:54,282
That much I've learned.

707
01:31:54,366 --> 01:31:58,446
If you wanted to get rich,
you went into the wrong line of work.

708
01:31:58,537 --> 01:32:00,530
That's what I'm saying.

709
01:32:01,123 --> 01:32:03,745
Think it's gonna be any different
in Tombstone?

710
01:32:03,834 --> 01:32:07,369
Can't say, but there's silver there.
And opportunity.

711
01:32:08,047 --> 01:32:09,791
The town's booming.

712
01:32:09,882 --> 01:32:13,334
They're gonna need saloons, stage lines,
hotels, you name it.

713
01:32:15,055 --> 01:32:17,972
Wyatt, did it ever occur to you...

714
01:32:18,058 --> 01:32:22,008
that maybe we're doing the only thing
that we're any good at?

715
01:33:48,404 --> 01:33:51,489
Goodbye, Allie. I'll see you a little later.

716
01:33:54,911 --> 01:33:57,069
- What's this all about?
- I don't know.

717
01:33:57,163 --> 01:34:00,864
- Where you going?
- Allie says they wanna talk to you alone.

718
01:34:20,146 --> 01:34:21,724
Thanks for coming, Wyatt.

719
01:34:28,071 --> 01:34:30,397
You're probably wondering
what this is about.

720
01:34:31,283 --> 01:34:32,611
You're damn right.

721
01:34:33,452 --> 01:34:36,406
We've been talking.
We like it here in Dodge.

722
01:34:36,497 --> 01:34:39,866
We want you to stop talking to
our husbands about going to Tombstone.

723
01:34:39,959 --> 01:34:43,957
All that nonsense about mining claims
and starting your own businesses.

724
01:34:44,046 --> 01:34:47,416
They all listen to you, Wyatt.
They'll do what you say.

725
01:34:47,509 --> 01:34:49,252
I know Morgan will.

726
01:34:52,222 --> 01:34:55,223
We'd like you
to just leave well enough alone.

727
01:34:55,308 --> 01:34:57,847
Just for once,
let the Earps settle down somewhere.

728
01:35:00,356 --> 01:35:01,387
Is that right?

729
01:35:04,193 --> 01:35:07,858
You brought me here to tell me that
without my brothers?

730
01:35:18,166 --> 01:35:19,958
Stop talking and start shooting.

731
01:35:20,043 --> 01:35:23,792
- They're upstairs.
- It's that goddamn Holliday and his whore.

732
01:35:23,881 --> 01:35:26,169
Where is it? Where'd you put it?

733
01:35:29,053 --> 01:35:30,796
Never again, you bastard.

734
01:35:30,888 --> 01:35:33,379
You've raised your hand to me
for the last time!

735
01:35:35,393 --> 01:35:38,062
It's Wyatt! I'm coming in!

736
01:35:38,855 --> 01:35:40,433
Don't shoot me!

737
01:35:44,402 --> 01:35:45,897
Where'd you hide it?

738
01:35:47,781 --> 01:35:49,572
Come on, little dove.

739
01:35:50,909 --> 01:35:53,032
Let's finally get it over with.

740
01:35:53,787 --> 01:35:56,824
Don't think I won't,
you skinny heap of pus.

741
01:36:01,003 --> 01:36:03,541
I won't have you hit me ever again.

742
01:36:03,798 --> 01:36:05,755
Put that gun down, Kate.

743
01:36:06,050 --> 01:36:08,802
I don't want you shooting me by mistake.

744
01:36:09,346 --> 01:36:12,300
Year after year, sleeping in his bed...

745
01:36:12,808 --> 01:36:15,643
breathing the diseased air
he coughs up all night!

746
01:36:15,811 --> 01:36:19,097
No one else would come near him.
This is what I get!

747
01:36:19,273 --> 01:36:21,266
This is his idea of a fair hand!

748
01:36:22,693 --> 01:36:26,276
- You won't be shooting him tonight, Kate.
- Let her do it.

749
01:36:26,656 --> 01:36:29,657
They can hang the bitch.
We'll both be happy.

750
01:36:55,478 --> 01:36:58,681
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with me?

751
01:36:59,399 --> 01:37:01,226
What have you got?

752
01:37:02,444 --> 01:37:04,851
I am dying of tuberculosis.

753
01:37:07,199 --> 01:37:09,524
Everyone who knows me hates me.

754
01:37:11,662 --> 01:37:14,663
I sleep with the nastiest whore
in Kansas...

755
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:17,792
and every morning I wake up surprised.

756
01:37:19,337 --> 01:37:23,382
Surprised I have to spend another day
in this piss hole world.

757
01:37:24,092 --> 01:37:26,797
Not everybody that knows you hates you.

758
01:37:30,015 --> 01:37:32,720
What were you fighting about this time?

759
01:37:34,686 --> 01:37:36,229
I don't recall.

760
01:37:36,980 --> 01:37:40,231
But like most times
when Kate and I disagree...

761
01:37:40,609 --> 01:37:42,401
we set to killing each other.

762
01:37:49,786 --> 01:37:52,573
All of you can kiss my rebel dick.

763
01:38:01,006 --> 01:38:04,340
I know sometimes it isn't easy
being my friend...

764
01:38:07,596 --> 01:38:10,170
but I'll be there when you need me.

765
01:38:15,563 --> 01:38:18,268
They say it was the biggest funeral
in Dodge's history.

766
01:38:18,358 --> 01:38:20,896
Of course, the town ain't that old.

767
01:38:22,863 --> 01:38:24,523
People liked Ed.

768
01:38:27,075 --> 01:38:29,827
We've covered some ground, haven't we?

769
01:38:33,416 --> 01:38:35,076
What is it, Wyatt?

770
01:38:36,377 --> 01:38:39,129
I've had it with being a lawman, Bat.

771
01:38:39,964 --> 01:38:42,372
I've had enough of being famous.

772
01:38:43,676 --> 01:38:45,468
I'm sick of Dodge.

773
01:38:46,054 --> 01:38:48,094
What are you two doing?

774
01:38:48,223 --> 01:38:50,512
Can't you wait to get in here?

775
01:38:51,643 --> 01:38:53,553
We're saying goodbye.

776
01:38:55,147 --> 01:38:57,140
I'm leaving Dodge, Doc.

777
01:38:57,983 --> 01:39:00,819
Hallelujah. I'll drink to that.

778
01:39:01,362 --> 01:39:03,153
I'm gonna settle down.

779
01:39:03,239 --> 01:39:07,533
Start some kind of business where nobody
wants to shoot me anymore.

780
01:39:07,660 --> 01:39:09,949
My brothers and I are going.

781
01:39:10,163 --> 01:39:13,497
- You're both welcome to come along.
- Where's that?

782
01:39:14,292 --> 01:39:16,084
Tombstone, Arizona.

783
01:39:20,507 --> 01:39:23,378
It does sound quiet, I'll give you that.

784
01:39:35,940 --> 01:39:38,229
The man we've been waiting for.

785
01:39:39,277 --> 01:39:41,484
- Come on in.
- Here you go.

786
01:39:41,571 --> 01:39:44,193
- Set it right down on that bench, son.
- Okay.

787
01:39:44,283 --> 01:39:46,322
Our savior has arrived.

788
01:39:47,286 --> 01:39:49,444
Yeah. Here you go.

789
01:39:50,289 --> 01:39:53,041
- Thank you, Mr. Earp.
- You're welcome.

790
01:39:58,131 --> 01:40:00,254
Morg, honey. Food's ready.

791
01:40:00,675 --> 01:40:03,842
- Come on, sweetie.
- I'll be right there, little darling.
