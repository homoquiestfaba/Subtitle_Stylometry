1
00:00:38,302 --> 00:00:39,905
- Grandma?
- Mm‐hmm?

2
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:41,274
What rhymes with "blue"?

3
00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:42,243
Let's see.

4
00:00:42,244 --> 00:00:43,311
Blue... "true."

5
00:00:43,312 --> 00:00:45,183
"I love you."

6
00:00:46,553 --> 00:00:49,357
Look at all these Valentines.

7
00:00:49,358 --> 00:00:51,294
We have quite a few.

8
00:00:51,295 --> 00:00:52,597
Oh!

9
00:00:52,598 --> 00:00:53,834
That rhymes with "blue," too.

10
00:00:56,005 --> 00:00:58,542
I made a Valentine
for everyone in my class.

11
00:00:58,543 --> 00:01:01,815
Oh. You take such good care
of your friends, Violet.

12
00:01:01,816 --> 00:01:04,487
How many Valentines do you think
you'll get this year?

13
00:01:04,488 --> 00:01:05,690
I don't know.

14
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:07,192
I didn't think about that.

15
00:01:07,193 --> 00:01:09,263
You'll get one for certain.

16
00:01:09,264 --> 00:01:10,601
How do you know that?

17
00:01:11,736 --> 00:01:14,007
Because I have
a Valentine for you.

18
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:16,377
For me?

19
00:01:16,378 --> 00:01:17,715
Mm‐hmm.

20
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,726
When I was a little girl,

21
00:01:23,727 --> 00:01:25,897
I loved this music box
more than anything.

22
00:01:25,898 --> 00:01:29,437
I used to wind it up
and listen to it every night

23
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:30,438
before I went to bed.

24
00:01:32,545 --> 00:01:33,980
It's yours now.

25
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:42,630
♪ Sometimes
Inside a single moment ♪

26
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:47,039
♪ Your heartbeat
can be stolen ♪

27
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,714
♪ And then
your whole life can change ♪

28
00:02:34,802 --> 00:02:36,740
And what are the doctors saying?

29
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:40,813
Nothing?

30
00:02:40,814 --> 00:02:42,216
I'll call you later, Mary Anne.

31
00:02:42,217 --> 00:02:43,787
Give him my love.

32
00:02:47,127 --> 00:02:48,328
Last time I checked,

33
00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:52,504
none of my grad students were
taking my undergrad classes.

34
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,641
What do you need, Violet?

35
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:56,945
‐I missed your office hours‐‐
‐Mm‐hmm.

36
00:02:56,946 --> 00:02:59,016
But I was hoping
to get your thoughts

37
00:02:59,017 --> 00:03:01,320
on some exciting discoveries
I'm making around

38
00:03:01,321 --> 00:03:03,626
the effects of music therapy
for patient rehabilitation.

39
00:03:03,627 --> 00:03:06,230
Your seminar grad
is based on you writing a paper.

40
00:03:06,231 --> 00:03:08,368
I know, but I picked up
some volunteer hours

41
00:03:08,369 --> 00:03:09,704
at the clinic,

42
00:03:09,705 --> 00:03:11,508
and it sort of
snowballed from there.

43
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:14,047
So... you didn't do a paper?

44
00:03:15,383 --> 00:03:17,119
Uh, no. Not yet, but‐‐

45
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,222
Again.

46
00:03:19,592 --> 00:03:20,860
Yes. But‐‐

47
00:03:20,861 --> 00:03:23,164
Your clinical hours
are through the roof.

48
00:03:23,165 --> 00:03:24,233
Thank you.

49
00:03:24,234 --> 00:03:25,469
But you consistently ignore

50
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,805
the mandatory
written assignments

51
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:28,441
that constitute your grade.

52
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:29,845
I know it looks bad,

53
00:03:29,846 --> 00:03:32,884
but I am doing the assignments‐‐
just in real life.

54
00:03:32,885 --> 00:03:35,489
You applied for
the music therapist position

55
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,959
at the university hospital,
correct?

56
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,696
Of course.
It's my dream job.

57
00:03:38,697 --> 00:03:41,467
Well, Miss McKay...

58
00:03:41,468 --> 00:03:43,506
your dedication is inspiring,

59
00:03:43,507 --> 00:03:45,877
but I'm afraid
there isn't gonna be a job,

60
00:03:45,878 --> 00:03:48,381
because you're not gonna be able
to graduate this semester.

61
00:03:48,382 --> 00:03:50,318
What?

62
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,487
No, no, no, Professor Carver‐‐

63
00:03:51,488 --> 00:03:53,458
I'm sorry.
I can't pass you.

64
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:55,328
Please. Please,
there has to be a way.

65
00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:56,899
The university hospital

66
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,638
has the finest music therapy
center in the country.

67
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,975
They have an acoustics lab
and everything.

68
00:04:01,976 --> 00:04:04,380
Well, we only have
two weeks left

69
00:04:04,381 --> 00:04:06,653
and my hands are tied.

70
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:13,264
You helped this patient
regain mobility in her hands?

71
00:04:13,265 --> 00:04:15,536
Yeah, I did.

72
00:04:15,537 --> 00:04:17,172
What about speech?

73
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,578
Do you think your methods
could help a patient

74
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:21,648
regain his ability to speak?

75
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:22,984
I don't see why not.

76
00:04:22,985 --> 00:04:25,423
Music has a very powerful
capacity to heal.

77
00:04:26,893 --> 00:04:28,662
I have a proposition for you.

78
00:04:28,663 --> 00:04:31,602
There is one...

79
00:04:31,603 --> 00:04:33,539
outside‐the‐box option

80
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,041
that the university hospital
offers

81
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:37,747
to students in your predicament.

82
00:04:37,748 --> 00:04:40,218
You would be required to do
in‐person patient sessions

83
00:04:40,219 --> 00:04:41,454
and a paper.

84
00:04:41,455 --> 00:04:42,557
Absolutely.

85
00:04:42,558 --> 00:04:45,161
You'd have until the end
of this semester‐‐

86
00:04:45,162 --> 00:04:46,397
February 15th.

87
00:04:46,398 --> 00:04:47,867
If you pass,

88
00:04:47,868 --> 00:04:50,338
I will personally recommend you
to the university hospital.

89
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:52,042
If you fail,

90
00:04:52,043 --> 00:04:54,514
well...

91
00:04:54,515 --> 00:04:56,785
I'll see you here next fall.

92
00:04:56,786 --> 00:04:59,156
I won't let you down.

93
00:04:59,157 --> 00:05:00,157
Who is the patient?

94
00:05:01,094 --> 00:05:02,898
My brother.

95
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:09,511
Two dozen red roses.

96
00:05:09,512 --> 00:05:12,449
So, are these for your mother?

97
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,120
- No, they're for my...
- Sister?

98
00:05:15,624 --> 00:05:16,758
No, for my‐‐

99
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:18,027
Real estate agent
who just landed you

100
00:05:18,028 --> 00:05:20,066
the perfect beach house
in Cape Cod?

101
00:05:21,836 --> 00:05:23,272
They're actually
for my girlfriend.

102
00:05:26,211 --> 00:05:28,014
Great.

103
00:05:28,015 --> 00:05:32,256
Okay, well, I will get those
for ya... right there.

104
00:05:32,257 --> 00:05:34,293
Well, I got that.

105
00:05:34,294 --> 00:05:36,632
Thank you.

106
00:05:36,633 --> 00:05:38,201
I come bearing gifts.

107
00:05:38,202 --> 00:05:39,571
Yes!

108
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:41,173
People did not appreciate

109
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,712
me tying their bouquets
with dental floss last year.

110
00:05:43,713 --> 00:05:46,551
What would I do without you?

111
00:05:46,552 --> 00:05:47,787
Well, you're gonna find out,

112
00:05:47,788 --> 00:05:50,993
because I'm going out of town
for two weeks.

113
00:05:50,994 --> 00:05:52,262
Oh...

114
00:05:52,263 --> 00:05:54,266
romantic getaway for one?

115
00:05:54,267 --> 00:05:55,636
Not exactly.

116
00:05:55,637 --> 00:05:57,073
I have a patient
out in Stockbridge.

117
00:05:58,075 --> 00:05:59,744
Wait, does this mean
you can't be my plus‐one

118
00:05:59,745 --> 00:06:01,682
for the Under the Sea party
on the 13th?

119
00:06:01,683 --> 00:06:05,155
Have I ever missed one of your
"O‐fish‐ally Single" mixers?

120
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:08,796
Good. Because I am going
all out this year.

121
00:06:08,797 --> 00:06:10,600
Even Donna's flying in.

122
00:06:10,601 --> 00:06:11,635
Wait, Donna?

123
00:06:11,636 --> 00:06:13,572
- From design school?
- Mm‐hmm.

124
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:15,442
I thought you said‐‐
quote, unquote‐‐

125
00:06:15,443 --> 00:06:16,812
she's "too perfect."

126
00:06:16,813 --> 00:06:18,716
I did not say that.

127
00:06:18,717 --> 00:06:20,987
It was "way too perfect."
'Kay?

128
00:06:20,988 --> 00:06:22,155
"Way too perfect."

129
00:06:22,156 --> 00:06:24,961
But it turns out
she's not so perfect after all.

130
00:06:24,962 --> 00:06:26,163
She just got divorced

131
00:06:26,164 --> 00:06:29,236
from her
Silicon Valley zillionaire

132
00:06:29,237 --> 00:06:31,875
and told me that
she's looking to mingle again.

133
00:06:31,876 --> 00:06:33,612
I'm sure she is.

134
00:06:33,613 --> 00:06:36,985
Who knows? Maybe you'll meet
an eligible Stockbridge suitor

135
00:06:36,986 --> 00:06:38,155
while you're out there.

136
00:06:39,157 --> 00:06:43,031
Honestly, I think
this is the year, V.

137
00:06:43,032 --> 00:06:44,300
That you finally get
your chocolate fountain

138
00:06:44,301 --> 00:06:45,002
for your mixer?

139
00:06:45,003 --> 00:06:46,672
The year
you finally fall in love.

140
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:49,577
Yeah, I'd probably put my money
on the chocolate fountain.

141
00:06:49,578 --> 00:06:50,646
Come on.

142
00:06:50,647 --> 00:06:51,748
When's the last time

143
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:53,852
you experienced
any kind of romance?

144
00:06:53,853 --> 00:06:55,523
What do you mean?

145
00:06:55,524 --> 00:06:57,860
I watched the entire season
of The Single Man with you,

146
00:06:57,861 --> 00:06:58,929
did I not?

147
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,231
Well, first of all, turns out

148
00:07:00,232 --> 00:07:01,601
the winner wasn't there
for the right reason.

149
00:07:01,602 --> 00:07:03,540
You know.

150
00:07:05,443 --> 00:07:08,615
And, second of all...

151
00:07:08,616 --> 00:07:10,352
I'm talking about you, V.

152
00:07:10,353 --> 00:07:11,988
You're always looking out
for everyone else.

153
00:07:11,989 --> 00:07:14,026
When are you gonna
open up your heart chakra

154
00:07:14,027 --> 00:07:16,163
and let someone take care of you
for a change?

155
00:07:16,164 --> 00:07:17,900
Wait.
Did you just say "heart chakra"?

156
00:07:17,901 --> 00:07:19,003
All I'm saying is,

157
00:07:19,004 --> 00:07:20,906
it's time you
put yourself out there, V.

158
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:22,476
Let me just take care
of my patient,

159
00:07:22,477 --> 00:07:24,079
get the job of my dreams,

160
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,482
find you a chocolate fountain,

161
00:07:25,483 --> 00:07:26,585
and then...

162
00:07:26,586 --> 00:07:29,924
we can talk all about aligning
my heart... chakra.

163
00:07:29,925 --> 00:07:32,731
- "Chakra."
- Chakra.

164
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,544
Do these hearts
look straight to you?

165
00:07:56,612 --> 00:07:58,382
A little higher on the right.

166
00:08:00,854 --> 00:08:03,191
Thanks.

167
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:05,529
I'm here to meet
my new patient, Charles Carver?

168
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:06,998
Let's see here.

169
00:08:06,999 --> 00:08:09,002
Charles Carver
was discharged this morning.

170
00:08:09,003 --> 00:08:11,407
He's under home care now.

171
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,277
Can I help you?

172
00:08:13,278 --> 00:08:14,346
I'm his doctor.

173
00:08:14,347 --> 00:08:16,918
Uh, I'm Violet.
I'm his new music therapist.

174
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:18,488
His what?

175
00:08:18,489 --> 00:08:20,125
I'm gonna be treating him
for the next two weeks,

176
00:08:20,126 --> 00:08:21,528
to help him regain his speech.

177
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:23,399
With music?

178
00:08:24,602 --> 00:08:25,936
Music therapy has shown

179
00:08:25,937 --> 00:08:29,042
to have so many positive
healing effects on patients‐‐

180
00:08:29,043 --> 00:08:31,648
from lowered blood pressure
to improved memory.

181
00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:32,717
Well...

182
00:08:32,718 --> 00:08:34,654
so has traditional medicine.

183
00:08:34,655 --> 00:08:37,727
Yeah, which, clearly, has
not been working for Charles.

184
00:08:37,728 --> 00:08:39,163
Is that right?

185
00:08:39,164 --> 00:08:41,100
And music's gonna make
all the difference?

186
00:08:41,101 --> 00:08:43,839
- Absolutely.
- I'll believe it when I see it.

187
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,475
You mean, when you "hear it."

188
00:08:45,476 --> 00:08:47,179
Ah, music puns.

189
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,148
Cute.

190
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:49,517
<i>Dr. Williams to O. R.</i>

191
00:08:49,518 --> 00:08:50,686
<i>Dr. Williams to O. R.</i>

192
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,189
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I have a patient to attend to.

193
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,193
Uh, no. No, no,
if you'll excuse me,

194
00:08:54,194 --> 00:08:56,497
I also have a patient
to attend to‐‐

195
00:08:56,498 --> 00:08:59,505
a patient that is gonna regain
his speech by Valentine's Day.

196
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,048
He thinks he is so important.

197
00:09:05,049 --> 00:09:08,522
Dr. Williams is performing
open‐heart surgery.

198
00:09:08,523 --> 00:09:10,092
He's pretty important.

199
00:09:11,194 --> 00:09:14,801
Uh, can I get Charles Carver's
home address, please?

200
00:09:14,802 --> 00:09:16,337
Sure.

201
00:09:16,338 --> 00:09:17,607
Word of advice.

202
00:09:17,608 --> 00:09:18,976
Mrs. Carver's hard to impress.

203
00:09:18,977 --> 00:09:21,348
Bring a gift.

204
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,810
Hey. Welcome
to Max's Chocolate Shop.

205
00:09:35,811 --> 00:09:37,279
I'm Max.

206
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,982
Hi.

207
00:09:38,983 --> 00:09:41,788
Hey, if you are looking
for a Valentine's Day box,

208
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:44,126
I just made a fresh batch.

209
00:09:44,127 --> 00:09:46,665
I'm actually looking
for something not romantic.

210
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,134
Oh. Okay, okay.

211
00:09:48,135 --> 00:09:49,904
Well, hey,
we got plenty of that.

212
00:09:49,905 --> 00:09:51,808
What kind of chocolate
do they like?

213
00:09:51,809 --> 00:09:53,545
You know, I don't know.

214
00:09:53,546 --> 00:09:57,219
And, apparently,
she is really hard to impress.

215
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,891
Hey. I mean, come on.

216
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:03,064
Everybody loves
a mixed assortment.

217
00:10:03,065 --> 00:10:04,366
Perfect.

218
00:10:04,367 --> 00:10:05,336
- Yeah?
- Mm‐hmm.

219
00:10:05,337 --> 00:10:07,306
Okay.

220
00:10:09,143 --> 00:10:11,380
By the way, I know
someone who's in the market

221
00:10:11,381 --> 00:10:13,251
to rent one of
those chocolate fountains.

222
00:10:13,252 --> 00:10:14,988
Really? Sweet.
Send 'em my way.

223
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,625
Expect a call from Desiree.

224
00:10:16,626 --> 00:10:17,994
Desiree?

225
00:10:17,995 --> 00:10:20,265
Okay, yeah, yeah.
No, I'll take good care of her.

226
00:10:20,266 --> 00:10:22,737
Um, you want this personalized,
right?

227
00:10:22,738 --> 00:10:23,805
Yes, please.

228
00:10:23,806 --> 00:10:25,075
To Mary Anne Carver.

229
00:10:26,546 --> 00:10:27,980
Mary Anne...

230
00:10:27,981 --> 00:10:29,918
That's my grandma.

231
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:30,920
Wait, really?

232
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:32,222
Yeah.

233
00:10:32,223 --> 00:10:34,694
Wait. Wait a second.
You're the music therapist.

234
00:10:34,695 --> 00:10:37,032
That's me. I'm Violet.

235
00:10:37,033 --> 00:10:39,537
Oh, wait. Oh, no.
She's not gonna like these.

236
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:40,472
Oh‐‐

237
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,078
What you're gonna want‐‐
trust me on this...

238
00:10:44,815 --> 00:10:48,487
are these‐‐
white chocolate.

239
00:10:48,488 --> 00:10:51,227
White chocolate, okay.
Thank you for the tip.

240
00:10:51,228 --> 00:10:53,966
It is my pleasure. Enjoy.

241
00:10:53,967 --> 00:10:55,669
Here.

242
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,939
Thank you.

243
00:10:57,941 --> 00:11:00,879
All right.
Your change is...

244
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,651
$11 and...

245
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,655
11 cents.

246
00:11:09,999 --> 00:11:11,534
Well, thank you. Again.

247
00:11:11,535 --> 00:11:12,803
Yeah.

248
00:11:12,804 --> 00:11:14,106
Next time, I have to come back
and get something for myself.

249
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:16,211
Okay. Can't wait.

250
00:11:43,098 --> 00:11:45,402
Come in, come in.

251
00:11:46,438 --> 00:11:50,078
Wow, your house is so beautiful.

252
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,083
Mm. You'll be staying
in the guest house.

253
00:11:53,285 --> 00:11:55,455
Oh, you must be Mrs. Carver.

254
00:11:55,456 --> 00:11:56,291
Mm‐hmm.

255
00:11:56,292 --> 00:11:57,392
I brought you these.

256
00:11:57,393 --> 00:11:59,631
Oh. Thank you.
You shouldn't have.

257
00:11:59,632 --> 00:12:00,833
He's upstairs.

258
00:12:00,834 --> 00:12:02,771
This way.

259
00:12:07,246 --> 00:12:09,684
It's so nice
to meet you, Charles.

260
00:12:09,685 --> 00:12:11,921
I'm Violet. I'm gonna be
your music therapist

261
00:12:11,922 --> 00:12:13,024
for the next two weeks.

262
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:16,632
I see that you are
a very big music fan.

263
00:12:17,768 --> 00:12:19,202
You used to play?

264
00:12:19,203 --> 00:12:22,143
That's great.
Music appreciation helps.

265
00:12:23,345 --> 00:12:25,716
I don't think we're gonna have
any problem making progress.

266
00:12:25,717 --> 00:12:27,853
Well, we're counting on it.

267
00:12:27,854 --> 00:12:30,024
I'm just gonna stay in
for this first session,

268
00:12:30,025 --> 00:12:31,628
if you don't mind.

269
00:12:31,629 --> 00:12:33,900
Yeah. No. Not at all.

270
00:12:36,037 --> 00:12:37,707
Okay, Charles.

271
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:41,046
So why don't we start
with some basic scales?

272
00:12:41,047 --> 00:12:43,117
That should be a piece of cake

273
00:12:43,118 --> 00:12:45,254
for a seasoned musician
like you.

274
00:12:45,255 --> 00:12:47,425
Sing after me.

275
00:12:47,426 --> 00:12:51,301
♪ Do, re, mi, fa, so... ♪

276
00:12:58,148 --> 00:12:59,817
No problem.

277
00:12:59,818 --> 00:13:02,223
Let's... hum along instead?

278
00:13:08,135 --> 00:13:09,972
Try it with me.

279
00:13:16,084 --> 00:13:18,388
Your turn.

280
00:13:21,629 --> 00:13:22,531
You know what?

281
00:13:22,532 --> 00:13:25,503
Why don't we back it up
and take it slow?

282
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:28,509
And we can do
some simple rhythm exercises.

283
00:13:29,712 --> 00:13:30,847
You good with that?

284
00:13:31,882 --> 00:13:34,287
Five, six, seven, eight...

285
00:13:42,136 --> 00:13:44,072
Let's just forget the clapping.

286
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:47,312
Let's imagine moving our fingers

287
00:13:47,313 --> 00:13:49,952
and playing
our favorite instrument.

288
00:13:51,287 --> 00:13:53,760
Yeah. Just like that.

289
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:02,777
Okay, um, you know what,

290
00:14:02,778 --> 00:14:04,447
I think that's‐‐
that's enough for now.

291
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,318
Oh, we're just getting started.

292
00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:09,289
This is an assessment
and it's tricky‐‐

293
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,959
Violet, I'd just like
to speak to you for a minute.

294
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,331
I... yeah.

295
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,284
Look, I want this to work,
I really do,

296
00:14:23,285 --> 00:14:25,789
but I'm having a hard time
believing that it will.

297
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,560
Just give me a couple days
with him,

298
00:14:27,561 --> 00:14:29,565
and you'll start to see
some real progress.

299
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:35,677
It's been a difficult year.

300
00:14:38,549 --> 00:14:40,719
We were married
on Valentine's Day.

301
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,192
It'll be
our 50th anniversary this year.

302
00:14:44,193 --> 00:14:45,797
Congratulations.

303
00:14:47,032 --> 00:14:49,337
Thank you.

304
00:14:50,405 --> 00:14:54,982
You know, he's the same man
I've always loved.

305
00:14:56,685 --> 00:14:59,625
And I love him
just the way he is.

306
00:15:01,361 --> 00:15:05,134
I just wish I could hear him
say "I love you"

307
00:15:05,135 --> 00:15:06,704
on our anniversary.

308
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:09,410
You have my word.

309
00:15:11,214 --> 00:15:12,684
Okay.

310
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:18,428
Okay.

311
00:15:22,102 --> 00:15:25,141
Your sessions with Charles
will be every day at 9:00 a. m.

312
00:15:25,142 --> 00:15:26,611
Don't be late.

313
00:15:26,612 --> 00:15:28,314
Oh, and my grandson
has volunteered

314
00:15:28,315 --> 00:15:29,917
to supervise his sessions.

315
00:15:29,918 --> 00:15:31,486
The chocolate maker?

316
00:15:31,487 --> 00:15:33,859
What? Oh, no, no.
No, the other one. The doctor.

317
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,562
No, he has rearranged
his surgery schedule

318
00:15:35,563 --> 00:15:36,798
for the next two weeks.

319
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:39,637
Oh! Violet.

320
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:41,975
Meet my grandson,
Dr. Blake Williams.

321
00:15:41,976 --> 00:15:44,012
- We met.
- We met.

322
00:15:44,013 --> 00:15:46,183
Well, great, because you two
are gonna be working together

323
00:15:46,184 --> 00:15:48,523
for the next two weeks.

324
00:15:51,294 --> 00:15:53,130
Just what the doctor ordered.

325
00:15:53,131 --> 00:15:55,402
Music to my ears.

326
00:16:02,116 --> 00:16:04,019
Hey, I'll take a beer.

327
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,756
Whatever you got on tap.

328
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:07,292
Is that...

329
00:16:07,293 --> 00:16:08,494
Hot chocolate.

330
00:16:08,495 --> 00:16:09,697
Don't you get
enough chocolate at work?

331
00:16:09,698 --> 00:16:11,768
Clearly,
you've never been in love.

332
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:12,970
You are projecting

333
00:16:12,971 --> 00:16:15,609
because you can't find a date
for Valentine's Day.

334
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:19,618
See, you spend too much time
in that chocolate shop, buddy.

335
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,955
What's this?

336
00:16:21,956 --> 00:16:25,027
Rose petal‐infused truffles.

337
00:16:25,028 --> 00:16:27,600
And the last carnation
after a word from our sponsors.

338
00:16:27,601 --> 00:16:29,102
<i>Oh, come on!</i>

339
00:16:29,103 --> 00:16:31,708
They always cut right before
the last carnation.

340
00:16:31,709 --> 00:16:34,714
Okay, catch me up
on your new patient.

341
00:16:34,715 --> 00:16:36,651
I mean, I don't
usually get nervous

342
00:16:36,652 --> 00:16:37,953
about these sorts of things,

343
00:16:37,954 --> 00:16:40,124
but between Professor Carver
and Mary Anne,

344
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,861
it's a lot of pressure.

345
00:16:41,862 --> 00:16:44,432
I basically promised them
a miracle by Valentine's Day.

346
00:16:44,433 --> 00:16:46,436
I hope I'm not in over my head.

347
00:16:46,437 --> 00:16:48,340
No way. You're brilliant.

348
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,445
Dr. Blake Williams
doesn't think so.

349
00:16:51,347 --> 00:16:53,885
Who's Dr. Blake Williams?

350
00:16:53,886 --> 00:16:55,121
<i>He sounds handsome.</i>

351
00:16:55,122 --> 00:16:57,258
He's just this guy who thinks
that he's better than me

352
00:16:57,259 --> 00:16:58,962
because he knows
how to use a scalpel

353
00:16:58,963 --> 00:17:00,097
instead of a piano.

354
00:17:00,098 --> 00:17:03,270
Hey, did you hear that Grandpa
is doing music therapy?

355
00:17:03,271 --> 00:17:05,776
Mm. Don't remind me.

356
00:17:05,777 --> 00:17:08,715
All right? This "therapist"
is overly‐idealistic,

357
00:17:08,716 --> 00:17:11,521
and she's gonna make Grandpa's
recovery ten times harder.

358
00:17:11,522 --> 00:17:13,591
It sounds like
this music therapist

359
00:17:13,592 --> 00:17:15,729
has really gotten
under your skin, huh?

360
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,600
Not really.

361
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:19,369
He is arrogant and difficult,

362
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:21,874
and he is making my job
twice as hard.

363
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,379
Sounds like you really care what
this Dr. Blake thinks.

364
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,049
No, I don't care what he thinks.

365
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,521
I care that he ruined my day.

366
00:17:28,522 --> 00:17:29,690
And my pedicure.

367
00:17:29,691 --> 00:17:30,959
Well, if he's got
a cute brother,

368
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,829
just let me know.

369
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,397
Anyway, it's like
what my grandma said,

370
00:17:33,398 --> 00:17:36,236
you know, tomorrow is a new day.

371
00:17:36,237 --> 00:17:37,472
Hey. You got plans next week?

372
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:38,942
Working with the music therapist

373
00:17:38,943 --> 00:17:39,977
in the mornings.

374
00:17:39,978 --> 00:17:41,848
Only a couple of surgeries
on deck. Why?

375
00:17:41,849 --> 00:17:43,585
I need you to come by the shop
and help me out.

376
00:17:43,586 --> 00:17:45,989
I'm drowning in orders.

377
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:49,029
Why do people get so crazy
about Valentine's Day?

378
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,164
You're only saying that

379
00:17:50,165 --> 00:17:52,168
because you've had your heart
broken too many times.

380
00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:55,007
You can't stay Stockbridge's
most‐eligible bachelor forever.

381
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:57,478
No, I believe that title
belongs to you.

382
00:17:57,479 --> 00:17:58,648
Yeah.

383
00:17:58,649 --> 00:18:00,418
And I think this is gonna
this is your year‐‐

384
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:02,255
this is gonna be the year

385
00:18:02,256 --> 00:18:04,125
that you find
your soulmate, Maxey.

386
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:05,629
Really?

387
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,700
Oh, absolutely.

388
00:18:07,701 --> 00:18:09,804
Oh, my gosh, it's back on.

389
00:18:09,805 --> 00:18:13,310
<i>who are you going
to promise forever?</i>

390
00:18:13,311 --> 00:18:14,881
Lauren A
is definitely going home.

391
00:18:26,817 --> 00:18:29,222
Hello.

392
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:31,325
Morning.

393
00:18:31,326 --> 00:18:34,198
So, uh, I got to get back
to the hospital

394
00:18:34,199 --> 00:18:36,602
for surgery
in a couple hours, so.

395
00:18:36,603 --> 00:18:37,637
Sounds serious.

396
00:18:37,638 --> 00:18:39,274
Are you sure you shouldn't
get going right now?

397
00:18:39,275 --> 00:18:41,212
You know, as much as I would
love to miss music class,

398
00:18:41,213 --> 00:18:42,848
I love my grandfather too much

399
00:18:42,849 --> 00:18:44,209
to leave him
in questionable hands.

400
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,789
"Questionable hands."

401
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,493
Do you know
the steadiness of hand

402
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,363
that it takes
to play Stravinsky?

403
00:18:50,364 --> 00:18:51,699
Let's just get this over with.

404
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,703
Let's.

405
00:18:53,704 --> 00:18:55,006
I spoke to Mary Anne

406
00:18:55,007 --> 00:18:56,475
and I thought we would
change up the environment.

407
00:18:56,476 --> 00:18:58,179
Hi, Grandpa.

408
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,284
How are you feeling today?

409
00:19:01,853 --> 00:19:05,326
So, I thought, instead of
just jumping into making music,

410
00:19:05,327 --> 00:19:08,533
I thought that maybe we could
listen to some music.

411
00:19:08,534 --> 00:19:10,303
Huh?

412
00:19:10,304 --> 00:19:12,975
Music memory has the power
to unlock muscle memory.

413
00:19:12,976 --> 00:19:15,414
Okay. Breathe in, Grandpa.

414
00:19:16,449 --> 00:19:17,485
Breathe out.

415
00:19:18,687 --> 00:19:19,888
You're a little congested.

416
00:19:19,889 --> 00:19:21,692
I'll ask Grandma
to make you some hot tea.

417
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:24,131
Earl Grey, right?

418
00:19:24,132 --> 00:19:26,302
Musical vibrations
can also boost immunity.

419
00:19:26,303 --> 00:19:28,540
The tea should do the trick.

420
00:19:32,315 --> 00:19:34,051
Wow...

421
00:19:34,052 --> 00:19:35,487
Look at all the records.

422
00:19:37,725 --> 00:19:39,095
Is this you?

423
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:42,734
Grandpa was pretty famous
in the local scene.

424
00:19:42,735 --> 00:19:46,342
He would have made it big
if the label hadn't gone under.

425
00:19:46,343 --> 00:19:50,050
But his instrument business
did pretty well, huh, Gramps?

426
00:20:22,582 --> 00:20:24,318
Today was good.

427
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:26,723
He didn't seem to hate it.

428
00:20:29,997 --> 00:20:32,767
A doctor with a motorcycle?

429
00:20:32,768 --> 00:20:33,770
Is there a problem?

430
00:20:34,974 --> 00:20:36,909
No. Just doesn't seem
like the best idea

431
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,346
for someone
who works at a hospital.

432
00:20:38,347 --> 00:20:40,117
All right.

433
00:20:40,952 --> 00:20:42,454
See you tomorrow.

434
00:20:42,455 --> 00:20:43,857
Unfortunately.

435
00:21:00,691 --> 00:21:02,560
Good morning, Lucille.

436
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:04,598
Looks like we made it
just on time.

437
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:05,401
Is the physio room ready?

438
00:21:05,402 --> 00:21:07,337
- It sure is.
- Okay, Grandpa.

439
00:21:07,338 --> 00:21:09,474
Morning, Charles. Blake.

440
00:21:09,475 --> 00:21:11,312
What can we do for you, Violet?

441
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:13,249
Nothing. I just heard
from Mrs. Carver

442
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,053
that you changed Charles'
physical‐therapy appointment

443
00:21:15,054 --> 00:21:16,155
to this morning.

444
00:21:16,156 --> 00:21:18,459
Yeah, there was
a last‐minute opening.

445
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,530
Yeah, but it's my time with him,

446
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:23,135
so maybe you'd like some music
to accompany your physio?

447
00:21:23,136 --> 00:21:24,304
No, I'm sorry,

448
00:21:24,305 --> 00:21:27,177
but this is a doctor‐and‐patient
only session.

449
00:21:27,178 --> 00:21:29,382
Come on, Grandpa.
Let's go.

450
00:21:30,284 --> 00:21:33,189
It's just down here.

451
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,392
You all right?

452
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:45,313
Oh. Flowers and chocolate.

453
00:21:45,314 --> 00:21:47,485
Yup.

454
00:21:49,422 --> 00:21:51,125
- Grandma. These are for you.
- What?

455
00:21:51,126 --> 00:21:53,062
Oh, thank you!
Sweet. Mm.

456
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:54,398
Come on in.

457
00:21:54,399 --> 00:21:55,566
Ahh.

458
00:21:55,567 --> 00:21:57,070
So thoughtful.

459
00:21:57,071 --> 00:21:59,241
If you really
want to win her over,

460
00:21:59,242 --> 00:22:01,479
she's a huge Emily Bronte fan.

461
00:22:16,876 --> 00:22:18,613
Ahh.

462
00:22:20,117 --> 00:22:23,456
What‐‐ What are you doing here?

463
00:22:23,457 --> 00:22:24,925
My grandmother told me
you were buying records

464
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:26,228
for Grandpa Charlie.

465
00:22:26,229 --> 00:22:27,931
I'm here to vet them.

466
00:22:27,932 --> 00:22:29,301
You're joking.

467
00:22:29,302 --> 00:22:30,870
Grandma wanted me
to invite you to dinner

468
00:22:30,871 --> 00:22:32,174
with the family tonight.

469
00:22:33,076 --> 00:22:34,444
Really?

470
00:22:34,445 --> 00:22:36,548
Well, unless, of course,
you're busy.

471
00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:39,855
No. I mean,
that's really nice of her.

472
00:22:39,856 --> 00:22:41,292
- Ah.
- I'll be there.

473
00:22:46,836 --> 00:22:48,539
Do you even like music?

474
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,209
My grandpa was a jazz musician.

475
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:51,445
I love music.

476
00:22:51,446 --> 00:22:53,349
I just don't believe
in music as medicine.

477
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:55,520
Okay.
So who's your favorite band?

478
00:22:55,521 --> 00:22:56,622
I don't have a favorite band.

479
00:22:56,623 --> 00:22:58,325
Because you don't really
like music.

480
00:22:58,326 --> 00:23:00,263
No, because I like solo artists.

481
00:23:00,264 --> 00:23:01,565
Hendrix. Janice Joplin.

482
00:23:01,566 --> 00:23:03,069
Paul Simon.

483
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:06,341
Paul Simon was half of a duo
before he became a solo artist.

484
00:23:06,342 --> 00:23:08,279
Everyone knows
Simon was better on his own.

485
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,414
I disagree!

486
00:23:09,415 --> 00:23:11,055
All of his best songs
were with Garfunkel.

487
00:23:11,954 --> 00:23:13,122
"Bridge Over Troubled Water,"

488
00:23:13,123 --> 00:23:15,159
"Sound of Silence,"
"Mrs. Robinson."

489
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:19,868
Well, I am buying Grandpa
a Paul Simon record.

490
00:23:19,869 --> 00:23:21,638
Or, I mean, we could compromise

491
00:23:21,639 --> 00:23:24,010
and get him a collection
of greatest‐‐

492
00:23:24,011 --> 00:23:25,949
love songs?

493
00:23:32,428 --> 00:23:35,066
Wow, Mary Anne,
this looks delicious.

494
00:23:35,067 --> 00:23:37,403
Oh, it's actually
my mother's recipe.

495
00:23:37,404 --> 00:23:39,775
She always said the fastest way
to a man's heart

496
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,910
was through his stomach.

497
00:23:40,911 --> 00:23:43,349
Medically untrue.

498
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:45,653
But that was interesting,
because, as it turned out,

499
00:23:45,654 --> 00:23:47,257
I was hopeless in the kitchen.

500
00:23:47,258 --> 00:23:49,661
I clearly did not inherit
the cooking gene,

501
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:50,631
like our Max did.

502
00:23:50,632 --> 00:23:52,134
That's right!

503
00:23:53,938 --> 00:23:56,175
But, luckily enough,

504
00:23:56,176 --> 00:23:57,577
Charles didn't seem to mind.

505
00:23:57,578 --> 00:24:00,082
He was happy just to go out
for dinner,

506
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:03,322
especially if
there was live music.

507
00:24:03,323 --> 00:24:07,664
Our very first date

508
00:24:07,665 --> 00:24:10,169
was at this quaint
little jazz club

509
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:11,472
in Stockbridge.

510
00:24:11,473 --> 00:24:13,209
Wow. Living on the edge,
Grandma.

511
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:14,979
Hey. Hey!

512
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,250
And right
in the middle of dinner,

513
00:24:17,251 --> 00:24:19,588
he was invited up
onto the stage‐‐

514
00:24:19,589 --> 00:24:22,995
to...
to play the saxophone.

515
00:24:22,996 --> 00:24:24,764
I mean...

516
00:24:24,765 --> 00:24:28,072
I didn't know what...

517
00:24:28,073 --> 00:24:30,010
it turned out it was his band!

518
00:24:32,047 --> 00:24:33,649
It was all a set‐up.

519
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:36,255
It was so sweet.

520
00:24:36,256 --> 00:24:39,161
Oh, I was so...

521
00:24:39,162 --> 00:24:40,664
enamored.

522
00:24:42,501 --> 00:24:44,104
Ah.

523
00:24:44,105 --> 00:24:46,074
What song were they playing?

524
00:24:46,075 --> 00:24:47,911
Um...

525
00:24:47,912 --> 00:24:49,615
It... "It Had to Be You."

526
00:24:53,023 --> 00:24:55,561
Yeah. "It Had to Be You."

527
00:24:58,066 --> 00:24:59,367
Aw, Blake.

528
00:24:59,368 --> 00:25:03,542
Is that why you used to sing
that song with your band?

529
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,146
Wait! You had a band?

530
00:25:05,147 --> 00:25:06,748
No, no.
It wasn't a serious band.

531
00:25:06,749 --> 00:25:09,287
It was just a group of us
from Doctors Without Borders

532
00:25:09,288 --> 00:25:12,026
doing covers
for the locals in Belarus.

533
00:25:12,027 --> 00:25:13,663
Did this band have a name?

534
00:25:17,004 --> 00:25:18,606
It was the, uh...

535
00:25:18,607 --> 00:25:19,575
it was
"the Heartmenders."

536
00:25:19,576 --> 00:25:21,579
- What?
- Come again?

537
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:24,751
"The Heartmenders."

538
00:25:24,752 --> 00:25:26,488
That's what it was!

539
00:25:26,489 --> 00:25:27,790
- Heartmenders.
- It was!

540
00:25:27,791 --> 00:25:28,994
He was wonderful.

541
00:25:28,995 --> 00:25:32,467
Wow. Is there a solo career
in your future, Mr. Simon?

542
00:25:32,468 --> 00:25:35,072
No. No. I'm retired.

543
00:25:35,073 --> 00:25:37,343
So what about you, Violet? Huh?

544
00:25:37,344 --> 00:25:39,214
You have a‐‐ a musical family?

545
00:25:39,215 --> 00:25:40,583
I do, yeah.

546
00:25:40,584 --> 00:25:43,289
As a little girl,
I was raised by my grandmother,

547
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:45,226
and there was always music
through the house.

548
00:25:45,227 --> 00:25:47,230
She had
the most beautiful voice.

549
00:25:47,231 --> 00:25:49,334
I still feel like
she's watching over me.

550
00:25:49,335 --> 00:25:50,904
Oh, that's so sweet.

551
00:25:52,875 --> 00:25:55,913
Uh... I would like
to make a toast.

552
00:25:55,914 --> 00:25:58,053
Oh.

553
00:25:59,121 --> 00:26:00,121
To...

554
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:03,562
- The Heartmenders.
- Of course.

555
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:06,469
To The Heartmenders.

556
00:26:14,285 --> 00:26:15,653
Here's your coat.

557
00:26:15,654 --> 00:26:16,855
Thanks.

558
00:26:16,856 --> 00:26:18,592
You know, that was nice,
what you said‐‐

559
00:26:18,593 --> 00:26:20,496
about your grandmother?

560
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:22,534
I was raised
by my grandparents, too.

561
00:26:24,805 --> 00:26:27,277
So, do The Heartmenders
have an upcoming show?

562
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:28,746
Very funny.

563
00:26:28,747 --> 00:26:30,916
‐I know the lead singer‐‐
‐All right, all right.

564
00:26:30,917 --> 00:26:32,453
so I don't want them
to sell out of tickets.

565
00:26:32,454 --> 00:26:33,622
You know?

566
00:26:33,623 --> 00:26:35,126
Maybe a backstage pass.

567
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:36,496
If you play your cards right.

568
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,269
Des. What's up?

569
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,774
I have a flower emergency!

570
00:26:42,775 --> 00:26:44,544
An order just came in
for a wedding‐‐

571
00:26:44,545 --> 00:26:45,613
their florist fell through.

572
00:26:45,614 --> 00:26:47,417
I am already up to my neck
in baby's breath

573
00:26:47,418 --> 00:26:48,919
with everything
I have to prepare

574
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,356
for Valentine's Day,

575
00:26:50,357 --> 00:26:52,627
and I just‐‐ I do not
have enough hands

576
00:26:52,628 --> 00:26:53,662
<i>to assemble
the wedding flowers in time.</i>

577
00:26:53,663 --> 00:26:54,999
Okay. All right. Don't panic.

578
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,835
I will be there in...

579
00:26:56,836 --> 00:26:57,972
Two hours?

580
00:26:57,973 --> 00:26:59,541
Oh, my...

581
00:26:59,542 --> 00:27:01,244
I'll be there soon.

582
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:02,714
Ah, you're the best.

583
00:27:02,715 --> 00:27:05,353
Really soon. Okay. Bye.

584
00:27:05,354 --> 00:27:06,755
You know, there's a game
tonight, Violet.

585
00:27:06,756 --> 00:27:08,693
You'll get there
a lot faster on a bike.

586
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:10,797
Yeah. No.

587
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:12,567
What, are you scared?

588
00:27:12,568 --> 00:27:15,807
No, I'm not scared.

589
00:27:22,595 --> 00:27:24,065
You're pretty good at this.

590
00:27:24,066 --> 00:27:26,670
Ah. Weddings. So romantic.

591
00:27:26,671 --> 00:27:29,542
Hey, this reminds me of
that episode of <i>The Single Man,</i>

592
00:27:29,543 --> 00:27:32,514
when he surprised Lauren G
on a date on a hot‐air balloon

593
00:27:32,515 --> 00:27:34,352
filled with flowers and, oh!

594
00:27:34,353 --> 00:27:37,024
Poor Lauren A did not
appreciate that gesture.

595
00:27:37,025 --> 00:27:38,861
That show is such a racket.

596
00:27:38,862 --> 00:27:41,700
I mean, they know each other
for what, two weeks?

597
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:43,570
All of a sudden, they're
supposed to fall in love?

598
00:27:43,571 --> 00:27:45,308
That doesn't happen
in real life.

599
00:27:47,112 --> 00:27:48,781
Dr. Williams here
is a realist.

600
00:27:48,782 --> 00:27:49,751
That's right.

601
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:51,352
He doesn't believe
in what he can't see.

602
00:27:51,353 --> 00:27:54,158
Love... musical therapy.

603
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:55,628
I believe in love, all right?

604
00:27:55,629 --> 00:27:58,433
I just don't believe
in Valentine's Day.

605
00:27:58,434 --> 00:28:01,039
You know, the flowers,
the chocolates,

606
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,844
the flying baby
with a bow and arrow

607
00:28:03,845 --> 00:28:06,149
he menacingly points
at unsuspecting singles.

608
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:08,086
Okay.
Leave Cupid out of this.

609
00:28:08,087 --> 00:28:11,125
I personally
love Valentine's Day.

610
00:28:11,126 --> 00:28:12,662
It's the one day a year

611
00:28:12,663 --> 00:28:14,933
you get to unapologetically show
people how much you love them,

612
00:28:14,934 --> 00:28:18,006
with flowers and...

613
00:28:18,007 --> 00:28:19,442
oh, chocolate.

614
00:28:19,443 --> 00:28:21,847
Maybe I should start
loading these in the truck.

615
00:28:21,848 --> 00:28:23,116
Mm‐hmm.

616
00:28:23,117 --> 00:28:25,254
Excuse me.

617
00:28:26,256 --> 00:28:27,859
Side bar‐‐ I approve.

618
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,261
What do you mean?

619
00:28:29,262 --> 00:28:31,867
Oh, you two
are perfect for each other.

620
00:28:31,868 --> 00:28:32,969
What?

621
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:35,173
No! No.

622
00:28:35,174 --> 00:28:36,677
Yeah, you with your big heart,

623
00:28:36,678 --> 00:28:40,217
him with his cool exterior,
just waiting to be loved.

624
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,956
Yeah, you know what?
Actually, it's perfect.

625
00:28:42,957 --> 00:28:45,928
Except for the fact that
we cannot stand each other.

626
00:28:45,929 --> 00:28:47,899
Hey, he drove you
all the way from Stockbridge

627
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,871
and he stuck around to help.

628
00:28:51,073 --> 00:28:54,145
I think you're just
a hopeless romantic.

629
00:28:54,146 --> 00:28:56,449
Oh. "Hopeful romantic."

630
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:57,786
Hopeful.

631
00:28:57,787 --> 00:29:00,123
Who knows? Maybe
I should start planning

632
00:29:00,124 --> 00:29:03,096
your floral arrangement
for your wedding.

633
00:29:03,097 --> 00:29:04,131
So?

634
00:29:04,132 --> 00:29:06,904
We all set?

635
00:29:06,905 --> 00:29:08,841
Yep. Yep, yep.

636
00:29:08,842 --> 00:29:12,047
I think we've accomplished
everything we needed to tonight.

637
00:29:12,048 --> 00:29:15,655
Yeah. And you know what?

638
00:29:15,656 --> 00:29:17,859
Here you go.

639
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,095
"O Fish Ally Single Mixer."

640
00:29:19,096 --> 00:29:21,032
Valentine's Day Eve?

641
00:29:21,033 --> 00:29:22,367
That's a thing?

642
00:29:22,368 --> 00:29:24,205
Oh, I'm making it a thing.

643
00:29:24,206 --> 00:29:27,679
Now you've been
cordially invited.

644
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,547
Who knows?

645
00:29:28,548 --> 00:29:30,885
Maybe Cupid will... tch...
strike ya...

646
00:29:30,886 --> 00:29:32,121
with his arrow.

647
00:29:32,122 --> 00:29:33,725
Luckily, I'm a surgeon.

648
00:29:35,595 --> 00:29:37,532
That's good.

649
00:29:39,102 --> 00:29:41,340
Oh, I definitely approve.

650
00:29:47,753 --> 00:29:48,788
We're here.

651
00:29:49,991 --> 00:29:51,360
- You okay?
- Yeah.

652
00:29:52,797 --> 00:29:54,633
Thanks for that.

653
00:29:54,634 --> 00:29:56,402
I probably...

654
00:29:56,403 --> 00:29:57,906
would have still
been sitting in traffic.

655
00:29:57,907 --> 00:29:58,908
It was nothing.

656
00:29:58,909 --> 00:30:01,413
You know, I'd do the same
for any, uh, colleague.

657
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:05,453
See you tomorrow.

658
00:30:05,454 --> 00:30:07,793
Yeah. Thanks, Doc.

659
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:35,213
Professor Carver. Hi.

660
00:30:35,214 --> 00:30:36,650
<i>This is your midpoint check‐in,</i>

661
00:30:36,651 --> 00:30:37,485
Miss McKay.

662
00:30:37,486 --> 00:30:39,021
How's it going?

663
00:30:39,022 --> 00:30:41,025
Great. Wonderful.

664
00:30:41,026 --> 00:30:44,598
Oh. Your enthusiasm suggests
you've made progress.

665
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:45,801
Yep.

666
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:48,474
Uh, well, I don't‐‐
I don't know if I would say...

667
00:30:49,409 --> 00:30:50,477
<i>There's definitely been‐‐</i>

668
00:30:50,478 --> 00:30:53,384
So, Charles hasn't spoken
a single word yet?

669
00:30:54,654 --> 00:30:55,955
No.

670
00:30:55,956 --> 00:30:56,957
But‐‐

671
00:30:56,958 --> 00:30:59,295
<i>You are less than a week
from your deadline.</i>

672
00:30:59,296 --> 00:31:01,968
Are you sure you can do this?

673
00:31:03,337 --> 00:31:06,309
Yeah. We are right on track.

674
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:08,447

683

we're taking a trip
down memory lane.

684
00:31:57,512 --> 00:31:59,515
It's the night of
your first date with Mary Anne.

685
00:31:59,516 --> 00:32:01,553
Can you picture
what she's wearing?

686
00:32:06,998 --> 00:32:08,902
I'm wearing a red dress.

687
00:32:13,612 --> 00:32:16,951
So, now, you're holding
the door open for her.

688
00:32:18,053 --> 00:32:19,624
And what do you say?

00:32:27,973 --> 00:32:30,043
Um...

690
00:32:30,044 --> 00:32:33,484
maybe visualization
doesn't work on Charles.

691
00:32:35,588 --> 00:32:37,558
I think we should take
a little break.

692
00:32:42,368 --> 00:32:44,572
11:11.

693
00:32:46,376 --> 00:32:48,981
You know...

694
00:32:48,982 --> 00:32:52,454
whenever my grandmother had
a day that wasn't going her way,

695
00:32:52,455 --> 00:32:54,325
she would stop
whatever she was doing,

696
00:32:54,326 --> 00:32:55,761
and she would
sing her favorite song.

697
00:32:55,762 --> 00:32:57,230
Just to get things back on track

698
00:32:57,231 --> 00:32:59,301
and to switch things up.

699
00:32:59,302 --> 00:33:01,272
What do you think?

00:33:01,273 --> 00:33:03,110

724
00:34:25,307 --> 00:34:26,307
Charles.

725
00:34:40,538 --> 00:34:42,775
Heard you singing.

726
00:34:42,776 --> 00:34:45,013
Your voice, it's, uh...

727
00:34:45,014 --> 00:34:46,282
it's something.

728
00:34:46,283 --> 00:34:48,052
Thank you?

729
00:34:48,053 --> 00:34:49,388
Yeah.

730
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:50,590
I heard you used to sing.

731
00:34:50,591 --> 00:34:52,729
I'm sure your voice
is something, too.

732
00:34:55,367 --> 00:34:57,338
Are you okay?

733
00:34:58,775 --> 00:35:00,176
You know, it didn't sound
like you and Grandpa

734
00:35:00,177 --> 00:35:01,579
really needed me in there...

735
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,852
as far as
the music therapy is concerned.

736
00:35:05,822 --> 00:35:07,257
He hummed along, you know.

737
00:35:07,258 --> 00:35:09,996
Yeah, well, not exactly
clinically significant,

738
00:35:09,997 --> 00:35:11,098
but not bad.

739
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:13,035
You are unbelievable.

740
00:35:13,036 --> 00:35:14,571
Someone's got to be
a realist, right?

741
00:35:14,572 --> 00:35:17,344
Yeah, more like
an impossible pessimist.

742
00:35:17,345 --> 00:35:20,216
Well, better than
a blind optimist.

743
00:35:20,217 --> 00:35:23,322
Gah, you're so... so...

744
00:35:23,323 --> 00:35:25,393
Ouch!
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

745
00:35:25,394 --> 00:35:26,329
What happened?

746
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:28,166
- Nothing.
- You all right?

747
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,234
- Yeah. I just got a splinter.
- Let me. Let me see.

748
00:35:29,235 --> 00:35:30,104
No, I'm good!

749
00:35:30,105 --> 00:35:31,740
- I can do it on my own.
- Let me see.

750
00:35:31,741 --> 00:35:34,011
- Trust me. Trust me.
- I can do it on my own.

751
00:35:34,012 --> 00:35:35,547
Trust me.

752
00:35:35,548 --> 00:35:37,686
Let me see.

753
00:35:41,828 --> 00:35:44,464
Ouch. Ouch, ouch, ouch.

754
00:35:44,465 --> 00:35:46,268
- There.
- Ouch!

755
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:47,940
Got it. It's out.

756
00:35:49,475 --> 00:35:51,179
That wasn't so bad, now, was it?

757
00:35:52,548 --> 00:35:53,918
Thank you, Doctor.

758
00:35:54,954 --> 00:35:57,424
Might not be able
to play Stravinsky,

759
00:35:57,425 --> 00:35:58,745
but I'm pretty good
with my hands.

760
00:35:59,562 --> 00:36:00,564
Cute.

761
00:36:06,285 --> 00:36:09,423
Wow. Black coffee?
Even your drink is pessimistic.

762
00:36:09,424 --> 00:36:10,692
I resent that.

763
00:36:10,693 --> 00:36:12,898
I value the taste
of real coffee.

764
00:36:12,899 --> 00:36:14,659
That looks like
it's gonna give you a cavity.

765
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,710
You, uh,
you have beautiful eyes.

766
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:22,183
And some whipped cream
on your lip.

767
00:36:22,184 --> 00:36:23,319
Ah.

768
00:36:25,723 --> 00:36:26,959
Is that...

769
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,063
Hey, Jimmy!

770
00:36:29,064 --> 00:36:30,732
He played trumpet
in my grandpa's jazz band.

771
00:36:30,733 --> 00:36:31,969
How're you doing?

772
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:34,040
Well, well, well,
if it isn't the Carver boy.

773
00:36:34,041 --> 00:36:35,342
- Miss.
- Hi.

774
00:36:35,343 --> 00:36:38,181
How's your grandpa holding up?

775
00:36:38,182 --> 00:36:39,885
Me and the boys wanted
to come by

776
00:36:39,886 --> 00:36:41,120
and pay a visit,

777
00:36:41,121 --> 00:36:43,024
but we didn't want
to disturb Mary Anne‐‐

778
00:36:43,025 --> 00:36:44,393
she's one tough cookie.

779
00:36:44,394 --> 00:36:46,731
You should try bringing her
some white chocolate.

780
00:36:46,732 --> 00:36:47,766
She's not wrong.

781
00:36:47,767 --> 00:36:49,170
I'll keep that in mind.

782
00:36:49,171 --> 00:36:51,341
Well, I don't want
to disturb your date.

783
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:52,878
Well‐‐

784
00:36:52,879 --> 00:36:54,515
- no, it's not a...
- It's not a...

785
00:36:57,754 --> 00:36:59,423
He plays a mean trumpet.

786
00:36:59,424 --> 00:37:02,129
Wait, so, the whole band
still lives in town?

787
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:04,600
Yup. I guess local celebrities
don't like to leave.

788
00:37:04,601 --> 00:37:05,537
I cannot believe

789
00:37:05,538 --> 00:37:08,175
that the Heartmenders
left Belarus behind.

790
00:37:08,176 --> 00:37:10,245
What can I say?
My patients needed me.

791
00:37:10,246 --> 00:37:12,919
We still get the occasional
piece of fan mail.

792
00:37:14,655 --> 00:37:16,457
Your grandpa's proud of you.

793
00:37:16,458 --> 00:37:19,064
I can tell.

794
00:37:20,366 --> 00:37:22,203
Thanks.

795
00:37:22,204 --> 00:37:25,342
I just wish there was more
I could do for him.

796
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:27,379
So do I...

797
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:30,018
but I think
you've been good for him.

798
00:37:30,019 --> 00:37:33,592
I mean, don't get me wrong‐‐
I'm still a skeptic,

799
00:37:33,593 --> 00:37:34,962
but I'd be lying if I said

800
00:37:34,963 --> 00:37:36,364
he didn't look happier
this past week

801
00:37:36,365 --> 00:37:37,634
than he has in a long time.

802
00:37:41,809 --> 00:37:43,278
So...

803
00:37:43,279 --> 00:37:45,082
um, you have any plans tonight?

804
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:48,622
Uh, Desiree got me
this rose oil face mask, so...

805
00:37:48,623 --> 00:37:51,328
Wow! Busy schedule.

806
00:37:55,938 --> 00:37:57,439
Are you...

807
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,912
Asking you to help out
at my brother's chocolate shop?

808
00:37:59,913 --> 00:38:00,914
Guilty.

809
00:38:00,915 --> 00:38:02,549
Are you kidding?

810
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:07,293
You helped tie, what,
a hundred bouquets for Desiree?

811
00:38:07,294 --> 00:38:10,399
So I'd say
it's the least I could do.

812
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,139
Awesome. Max will be thrilled
to have another helping hand.

813
00:38:14,943 --> 00:38:16,544
You, uh...

814
00:38:16,545 --> 00:38:18,282
have a little more
whipped cream.

815
00:38:20,186 --> 00:38:22,959
I can feel the cavities forming.

816
00:38:26,432 --> 00:38:28,702
- Maxey.
- Hey! There you guys are.

817
00:38:28,703 --> 00:38:30,505
Okay. Yeah. Oh!

818
00:38:30,506 --> 00:38:32,309
I'm up to my eyeballs
in fondant.

819
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,511
Are you guys ready?

820
00:38:33,512 --> 00:38:34,381
Huh? Yeah, okay,

821
00:38:34,382 --> 00:38:35,917
'cause I need you here.
All right.

822
00:38:35,918 --> 00:38:37,419
Is he gonna be okay?

823
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:40,994
Oh, yeah, 100% normal
pre‐Valentine's Day behavior.

824
00:38:40,995 --> 00:38:42,596
I do 12‐hour surgeries‐‐

825
00:38:42,597 --> 00:38:44,166
nothing compared to this.

826
00:38:44,167 --> 00:38:46,204
Okay, what do I need?
What do I need?

827
00:38:46,205 --> 00:38:48,309
Come on, come on,
let's go, let's go.

828
00:38:50,046 --> 00:38:51,714
Um, yeah. That's good.

829
00:38:51,715 --> 00:38:54,787
So... what're we making?

830
00:38:54,788 --> 00:38:57,159
It's almost Valentine's Day.
We're making everything‐‐

831
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,695
starting with

832
00:38:58,696 --> 00:39:01,200
my world‐famous chocolate‐
covered Graham crackers.

833
00:39:01,201 --> 00:39:02,269
The secret is‐‐

834
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:03,672
Two layers of chocolate!

835
00:39:03,673 --> 00:39:05,610
Yeah!

836
00:39:09,584 --> 00:39:11,788
You look like
you know what you're doing.

837
00:39:11,789 --> 00:39:12,991
Yeah.

838
00:39:12,992 --> 00:39:14,260
Blake helps me every year.

839
00:39:14,261 --> 00:39:15,662
Whether I want to or not.

840
00:39:15,663 --> 00:39:16,932
Come on, man.

841
00:39:16,933 --> 00:39:18,635
Oh, wait.
You know what?

842
00:39:18,636 --> 00:39:19,837
I need some maple syrup,

843
00:39:19,838 --> 00:39:22,210
because that is
the second secret ingredient.

844
00:39:23,212 --> 00:39:25,182
This might be a good time
to tell you

845
00:39:25,183 --> 00:39:26,451
that I am a terrible cook.

846
00:39:26,452 --> 00:39:28,488
Well, luckily,
we're baking, not cooking.

847
00:39:28,489 --> 00:39:30,192
It's more science than art.

848
00:39:30,193 --> 00:39:31,828
Oh. So that's why you like it.

849
00:39:31,829 --> 00:39:32,998
Bingo. Can you stir this?

850
00:39:32,999 --> 00:39:33,867
Yeah.

851
00:39:33,868 --> 00:39:36,037
Thanks, Doc.

852
00:39:36,038 --> 00:39:37,774
So why did you
become a doctor, anyway?

853
00:39:39,912 --> 00:39:42,316
Well, there's a lot of reasons
I became a doctor.

854
00:39:42,317 --> 00:39:45,155
It's, uh, methodical, orderly.

855
00:39:45,156 --> 00:39:48,194
There's generally a reliable way
of doing things

856
00:39:48,195 --> 00:39:49,675
in order to achieve
a certain outcome.

857
00:39:50,633 --> 00:39:51,869
That's very practical.

858
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:54,006
And you know the other reason.

859
00:39:54,007 --> 00:39:55,910
Can you crumble these?

860
00:39:55,911 --> 00:39:58,983
Uh... sure.

861
00:39:58,984 --> 00:40:00,753
What is "the other reason"?

862
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:05,729
Ah, it's, uh...
it's kind of mushy.

863
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:06,565
They're Graham crackers.

864
00:40:06,566 --> 00:40:08,068
Aren't they supposed
to be mushy?

865
00:40:08,069 --> 00:40:11,007
No, I mean, the other reason
I wanted to become a surgeon.

866
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:13,411
It's a...
It's a little mushy.

867
00:40:13,412 --> 00:40:15,783
Well, your secret
is safe with me.

868
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,589
Chocolate makers' code.

869
00:40:22,797 --> 00:40:24,501
Okay.

870
00:40:26,505 --> 00:40:28,609
I lost my parents
in a car accident when I was 11.

871
00:40:30,981 --> 00:40:32,082
I'm sorry.

872
00:40:32,083 --> 00:40:34,019
Max and I moved in
with our grandparents

873
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,958
not long after.

874
00:40:37,127 --> 00:40:39,631
I asked for a stethoscope
that Christmas.

875
00:40:41,702 --> 00:40:43,405
So you knew you wanted
to be a doctor

876
00:40:43,406 --> 00:40:44,440
since you were a kid?

877
00:40:44,441 --> 00:40:47,246
I don't know, I guess.

878
00:40:47,247 --> 00:40:50,652
And what I really wanted
was to do everything I could

879
00:40:50,653 --> 00:40:52,756
to help people never experience

880
00:40:52,757 --> 00:40:54,693
the heartache
that I went through.

881
00:40:54,694 --> 00:40:56,965
You know, I thought
if I studied hard enough,

882
00:40:56,966 --> 00:40:58,401
I could...

883
00:40:58,402 --> 00:40:59,671
change the outcome...

884
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,840
for other people.

885
00:41:03,279 --> 00:41:07,152
Gives new meaning
to being a heart doctor, huh?

886
00:41:07,153 --> 00:41:08,521
Told you it was mushy.

887
00:41:08,522 --> 00:41:10,592
No.

888
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:12,697
It's sweet.

889
00:41:16,772 --> 00:41:18,308
What about you?

890
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,948
Why'd you decide
to go into music therapy?

891
00:41:22,817 --> 00:41:24,186
I also lost my mom,

892
00:41:24,187 --> 00:41:26,390
and my grandma raised me.

893
00:41:26,391 --> 00:41:27,860
I used to sing to her

894
00:41:27,861 --> 00:41:32,003
and she always told me
it made her feel better.

895
00:41:33,105 --> 00:41:36,913
So right before she passed away,
I made her this promise that...

896
00:41:38,082 --> 00:41:39,183
no matter what,

897
00:41:39,184 --> 00:41:42,724
I would try to use my voice
to heal people.

898
00:41:44,027 --> 00:41:46,197
Wow.

899
00:41:46,198 --> 00:41:47,934
I didn't know that.

900
00:41:47,935 --> 00:41:49,271
Yeah.

901
00:41:50,473 --> 00:41:53,244
So, who's the special person
in Violet McKay's life?

902
00:41:53,245 --> 00:41:55,215
There is no special person.

903
00:41:55,216 --> 00:41:56,217
Why not?

904
00:41:56,218 --> 00:41:58,321
Because.

905
00:41:58,322 --> 00:41:59,723
I don't know.

906
00:41:59,724 --> 00:42:02,496
My last relationship ended
with him moving away to Denver.

907
00:42:02,497 --> 00:42:04,033
You didn't want to go with him?

908
00:42:04,034 --> 00:42:06,204
He didn't ask me.

909
00:42:06,205 --> 00:42:07,473
Which is fine,

910
00:42:07,474 --> 00:42:09,176
because it allowed me

911
00:42:09,177 --> 00:42:11,481
to pour my time and energy
into my career.

912
00:42:11,482 --> 00:42:12,683
Huh.

913
00:42:12,684 --> 00:42:13,852
Well, I'd say

914
00:42:13,853 --> 00:42:17,460
that was a colossal
error in judgment on his part.

915
00:42:19,331 --> 00:42:21,301
Thank you.

916
00:42:22,203 --> 00:42:23,873
So what about you?

917
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,978
When...
When was your last relationship?

918
00:42:27,413 --> 00:42:30,018
Ended about two years ago.

919
00:42:30,019 --> 00:42:32,756
Found out she cheated on me...

920
00:42:32,757 --> 00:42:35,329
one week before
I was gonna propose.

921
00:42:36,798 --> 00:42:37,798
Perfect timing.

922
00:42:39,704 --> 00:42:41,174
Well...

923
00:42:41,175 --> 00:42:42,809
I'd say

924
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:45,416
that was a colossal error
in judgment on her part.

925
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:51,461
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

926
00:42:51,462 --> 00:42:53,498
You gotta keep stirring

927
00:42:53,499 --> 00:42:55,835
or else it's gonna get too hot.

928
00:42:55,836 --> 00:42:56,837
Sorry. Right.

929
00:42:56,838 --> 00:42:57,740
Maxey.

930
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,143
Yeah. Okay.
You're doing great.

931
00:42:59,144 --> 00:43:00,445
Like this.

932
00:43:00,446 --> 00:43:02,650
- Okay. All right.
- And keep going.

933
00:43:04,187 --> 00:43:06,558
Ooh, look at that.

934
00:43:09,564 --> 00:43:10,366
Wow.

935
00:43:10,367 --> 00:43:11,534
We did it.

936
00:43:11,535 --> 00:43:13,504
You can come back next year,
Violet,

937
00:43:13,505 --> 00:43:16,043
because your baking was superb.

938
00:43:16,044 --> 00:43:17,145
What about me?

939
00:43:17,146 --> 00:43:18,349
Yeah, you were okay.

940
00:43:23,903 --> 00:43:25,839
For your information,
music therapy has been around

941
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,945
since the days
of Plato and Aristotle.

942
00:43:28,913 --> 00:43:30,515
They believed
that it contributed positively

943
00:43:30,516 --> 00:43:32,486
towards public health.

944
00:43:32,487 --> 00:43:34,724
Well, who am I to argue
with the greats?

945
00:43:34,725 --> 00:43:37,096
Have you ever listened
to ABBA's "Dancing Queen"

946
00:43:37,097 --> 00:43:38,398
and not smiled?

947
00:43:38,399 --> 00:43:40,002
Or how about,

948
00:43:40,003 --> 00:43:42,539
every time I hear
Adele's "Someone Like You,"

949
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,877
I bawl my eyes out like a baby.

950
00:43:44,878 --> 00:43:47,316
Celine Dion‐‐
"My Heart Will Go On."

951
00:43:47,317 --> 00:43:48,953
I mean, there's a tearjerker.

952
00:43:48,954 --> 00:43:50,155
See?

953
00:43:50,156 --> 00:43:51,858
You're starting to get it.

954
00:43:51,859 --> 00:43:54,965
Music can tap into
our emotional systems.

955
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:56,601
I'll be driving my car

956
00:43:56,602 --> 00:43:58,138
and a song will come
on the radio,

957
00:43:58,139 --> 00:43:59,340
and, instantly,

958
00:43:59,341 --> 00:44:02,046
I am just transported back
to that certain time in my life.

959
00:44:02,047 --> 00:44:05,852
A song can stimulate our memory
in powerful ways.

960
00:44:05,853 --> 00:44:10,463
It can make us feel things
we haven't felt in a long time.

961
00:44:11,832 --> 00:44:14,738
Well, uh,
speaking of nostalgia...

962
00:44:15,773 --> 00:44:18,179
I have a little surprise for you
back at the house.

963
00:44:19,348 --> 00:44:20,984
Come on.

964
00:44:23,255 --> 00:44:25,425
You've got a whole rotisserie.

965
00:44:25,426 --> 00:44:26,528
That's right.

966
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:30,635
So, when do I get to hear

967
00:44:30,636 --> 00:44:32,673
this famous singing voice
of yours?

968
00:44:32,674 --> 00:44:34,643
Right about never.

969
00:44:34,644 --> 00:44:37,416
That is not fair!
You heard me sing.

970
00:44:37,417 --> 00:44:40,055
You basically have
the voice of an angel,

971
00:44:40,056 --> 00:44:43,529
you know,
so I'm a little intimidated.

972
00:44:45,333 --> 00:44:46,667
What's your favorite song
to sing

973
00:44:46,668 --> 00:44:48,438
when you're not
seeing to patients?

974
00:44:48,439 --> 00:44:49,841
That's a tough one.

975
00:44:56,088 --> 00:44:57,489

You're incredible.

985
00:45:32,995 --> 00:45:34,630
Thank you.

986
00:45:34,631 --> 00:45:36,367
It's my grandmother's song.

987
00:45:36,368 --> 00:45:37,871
Here you go.

988
00:45:39,374 --> 00:45:40,542
This looks great.

989
00:45:40,543 --> 00:45:42,546
I'm gonna take this to go.

990
00:45:42,547 --> 00:45:44,450
It's getting late.

991
00:45:44,451 --> 00:45:46,321
Okay.

992
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:49,427
I'll see you tomorrow?

993
00:45:49,428 --> 00:45:51,665
Yeah. Yeah.

994
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:53,735
Goodnight, Violet.

995
00:45:53,736 --> 00:45:56,175
Goodnight, Dr. Williams.

996
00:45:59,281 --> 00:46:00,616
This was fun.

997
00:46:01,953 --> 00:46:03,189
This looks good.

998
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:20,388
So what do you think, Grandpa?

999
00:46:20,389 --> 00:46:23,027
You wanna take it out
for a spin?

1000
00:46:23,028 --> 00:46:26,168
Let's see those fingers
we've been practicing.

1001
00:46:27,203 --> 00:46:28,239
Outstanding!

1002
00:46:36,522 --> 00:46:37,857
Let's improvise.

1003
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:19,406
Bravo. Bravo!

1004
00:47:19,407 --> 00:47:20,508
Well done, Grandpa.

1005
00:47:20,509 --> 00:47:22,713
That was amazing.

1006
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:23,950
Wow.

1007
00:47:25,052 --> 00:47:27,958
So good.

1008
00:47:29,261 --> 00:47:30,662
Are you sure you don't want
any hot cocoa?

1009
00:47:30,663 --> 00:47:32,699
I think I've had
enough chocolate‐‐

1010
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:33,936
for the year.

1011
00:47:33,937 --> 00:47:35,839
For the year?

1012
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:38,278
Let me guess.
You're not a big V‐Day fan?

1013
00:47:38,279 --> 00:47:40,015
- Eh.
- That's a shocker.

1014
00:47:40,016 --> 00:47:42,319
I like that it means something
to my grandparents‐‐

1015
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:45,225
50 years together,
that's quite an accomplishment.

1016
00:47:45,226 --> 00:47:47,296
It certainly means something
to Desiree and Max.

1017
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:48,398
Ooh...

1018
00:47:48,399 --> 00:47:51,504
I've just never really had
a reason to celebrate it,

1019
00:47:51,505 --> 00:47:53,107
personally.

1020
00:47:53,108 --> 00:47:54,711
Well, now you do.

1021
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,350
Your grandfather is the reason.

1022
00:47:58,485 --> 00:47:59,485
Right.

1023
00:48:00,723 --> 00:48:03,294
So, I take it
you're a big V‐Day fan?

1024
00:48:03,295 --> 00:48:06,100
Well, I love me a love song‐‐

1025
00:48:06,101 --> 00:48:07,202
that's for sure‐‐

1026
00:48:07,203 --> 00:48:10,275
but I guess I was more into it
when I was a kid.

1027
00:48:10,276 --> 00:48:12,312
Every year, my grandma and I
would make Valentines

1028
00:48:12,313 --> 00:48:13,848
for everyone in my class.

1029
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:16,787
And this one year,
she gave me this music box.

1030
00:48:16,788 --> 00:48:18,291
I still have it.

1031
00:48:18,292 --> 00:48:21,230
I can't fall asleep at night
unless I hear that song.

1032
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:23,402
Your grandma sounds like
she was a pretty amazing lady.

1033
00:48:24,571 --> 00:48:27,844
Music has always been a way
for me to feel close to her.

1034
00:48:29,214 --> 00:48:31,617
Well, I'm sure she would've
been proud of you, too.

1035
00:48:31,618 --> 00:48:34,156
I'd like to think so.

1036
00:48:34,157 --> 00:48:37,162
I know this might sound
a little weird,

1037
00:48:37,163 --> 00:48:39,266
but every time I see "11:11,"

1038
00:48:39,267 --> 00:48:40,769
I know she's with me.

1039
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:43,242
It was just our special number.

1040
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:45,679
Can't believe I only have
a few more days left

1041
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:46,782
with your grandpa.

1042
00:48:48,018 --> 00:48:51,891
Why the deadline to get Grandpa
to speak by Valentine's Day?

1043
00:48:51,892 --> 00:48:55,298
Because, if I don't,
I have to retake the class,

1044
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:58,304
which means a whole new
trimester at school,

1045
00:48:58,305 --> 00:49:00,943
and I don't think my dream job
at the university hospital

1046
00:49:00,944 --> 00:49:03,314
will still be waiting for me.

1047
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:06,387
You know, my cousin, Charlie,
works there.

1048
00:49:06,388 --> 00:49:08,358
Might be able to put in
a good word for you?

1049
00:49:08,359 --> 00:49:10,529
I didn't realize you were under
so much pressure.

1050
00:49:11,665 --> 00:49:13,568
Would you have been easier
on me if you did?

1051
00:49:13,569 --> 00:49:15,239
Not a chance.

1052
00:49:16,308 --> 00:49:17,776
Didn't think so.

1053
00:49:17,777 --> 00:49:20,081
Looks like Cupid threw up
in your basket.

1054
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:22,519
Wow. You really despise Cupid.

1055
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,821
How could I despise a baby?

1056
00:49:23,822 --> 00:49:25,925
I just think he should
put some clothes on.

1057
00:49:25,926 --> 00:49:28,364
I'll have you know
I am starting to warm up

1058
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:30,602
to this whole
Valentine's Day thing.

1059
00:49:30,603 --> 00:49:33,208
Wow. One trip to the market
and you're like a brand‐new man.

1060
00:49:34,444 --> 00:49:35,612
Hi.

1061
00:49:35,613 --> 00:49:38,618
Okay, we got streamers...

1062
00:49:38,619 --> 00:49:40,255
napkins...

1063
00:49:40,256 --> 00:49:42,059
candles, plates...

1064
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:44,930
And every kind of heart
the market has to offer.

1065
00:49:44,931 --> 00:49:47,102
What's with all the decorations?

1066
00:49:47,103 --> 00:49:49,473
I don't know,
I was feeling kind of festive.

1067
00:49:49,474 --> 00:49:52,813
I thought maybe I'd go decorate
the guest house, you know?

1068
00:49:52,814 --> 00:49:54,351
Romantic Valentine's Day
for one.

1069
00:49:55,753 --> 00:49:57,689
You are adorable.

1070
00:49:57,690 --> 00:50:00,395
Just don't
let my grandmother see.

1071
00:50:00,396 --> 00:50:01,664
Wait a second.

1072
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,234
What if we decorate
their living room?

1073
00:50:03,235 --> 00:50:04,536
I'm confused.

1074
00:50:04,537 --> 00:50:06,707
I just told you my grandma
doesn't do decorations.

1075
00:50:06,708 --> 00:50:08,378
No. No, no. No, no.
Listen. Hear me out.

1076
00:50:08,379 --> 00:50:09,247
What if we decorate it

1077
00:50:09,248 --> 00:50:10,984
and surprise them
for their 50th?

1078
00:50:11,918 --> 00:50:13,354
It's not every day

1079
00:50:13,355 --> 00:50:14,790
that they get to celebrate
a milestone like this.

1080
00:50:14,791 --> 00:50:16,761
Okay. I'm in.

1081
00:50:16,762 --> 00:50:18,097
Here you go.

1082
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,466
Wait. Did you just say
you were in?

1083
00:50:19,467 --> 00:50:20,669
Yeah.

1084
00:50:22,206 --> 00:50:24,076
Huh. 11.11.

1085
00:50:24,077 --> 00:50:25,146
Weird.

1086
00:50:27,383 --> 00:50:29,020
Thanks.

1087
00:50:29,989 --> 00:50:31,457
Are you spotting me?

1088
00:50:31,458 --> 00:50:32,393
Yes, I'm spotting you.

1089
00:50:32,393 --> 00:50:33,295
What are you doing up there?
You got it?

1090
00:50:33,296 --> 00:50:34,730
I think that looks pretty good.

1091
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:36,500
Hey! I think
I hear them coming.

1092
00:50:36,501 --> 00:50:37,637
Oh, okay.

1093
00:50:41,946 --> 00:50:43,515
Surprise!

1094
00:50:45,553 --> 00:50:47,756
What do you think, Grandma?

1095
00:50:47,757 --> 00:50:50,128
I think...

1096
00:50:50,129 --> 00:50:51,897
I think it's wonderful.

1097
00:50:51,898 --> 00:50:53,201
Thank you.

1098
00:50:53,202 --> 00:50:55,305
- I'm glad you like it.
- Yeah.

1099
00:50:55,306 --> 00:50:58,411
And this is perfect
for our 50th, too.

1100
00:50:58,412 --> 00:51:00,281
Oh, you.

1101
00:51:00,282 --> 00:51:02,686
Thank you.

1102
00:51:02,687 --> 00:51:04,022
Ohh.

1103
00:51:04,023 --> 00:51:06,261
Oh, this is so lovely.

1104
00:51:15,887 --> 00:51:17,389
<i>Brussels sprouts?</i>

1105
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:18,524
<i>Mm‐hmm.</i>

1106
00:51:18,525 --> 00:51:20,295
<i>Oh, that's bad,</i>

1107
00:51:20,296 --> 00:51:21,998
<i>but it's the only one
you've missed so far.</i>

1108
00:51:21,999 --> 00:51:24,603
Ah, this is
such a romantic movie.

1109
00:51:24,604 --> 00:51:26,641
Right?

1110
00:51:28,011 --> 00:51:30,782
I love black‐and‐white films.

1111
00:51:30,783 --> 00:51:31,885
What do you say

1112
00:51:31,886 --> 00:51:33,989
we give these two lovebirds
some time alone?

1113
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:35,525
You want to go get some snacks?

1114
00:51:35,526 --> 00:51:38,264
Yeah, snacks sound good.

1115
00:51:38,265 --> 00:51:39,700
Hey, did you say "snacks"?

1116
00:51:39,701 --> 00:51:40,735
Sorry.

1117
00:51:40,736 --> 00:51:41,972
Buttered popcorn, please.

1118
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:44,543
You got it, Grams.

1119
00:51:44,544 --> 00:51:47,816
<i>Well, she's pretty...</i>

1120
00:51:47,817 --> 00:51:49,153
I can't remember the last time

1121
00:51:49,154 --> 00:51:51,490
Grandma and Grandpa
went on a proper date.

1122
00:51:51,491 --> 00:51:54,430
I can't believe that
they've been together 50 years.

1123
00:51:54,431 --> 00:51:56,868
Most of the contestants
on <i>The Single Man</i>

1124
00:51:56,869 --> 00:51:58,671
they don't even last six weeks.

1125
00:51:58,672 --> 00:52:01,377
You really like that show?

1126
00:52:01,378 --> 00:52:03,214
I support Desiree.

1127
00:52:03,215 --> 00:52:05,185
Would you ever
go on <i>The Single Man?</i>

1128
00:52:05,186 --> 00:52:07,990
What? No. No.
I would totally lose.

1129
00:52:07,991 --> 00:52:10,595
I would become best friends
with all the women.

1130
00:52:10,596 --> 00:52:12,332
I'm not very competitive.

1131
00:52:12,333 --> 00:52:14,671
You could've fooled me.

1132
00:52:15,974 --> 00:52:17,944
You are the exception.

1133
00:52:17,945 --> 00:52:19,012
<i>Good luck.</i>

1134
00:52:19,013 --> 00:52:21,918
Oh. So it's my fault?

1135
00:52:21,919 --> 00:52:24,423
I hope Desiree finds love
at her singles mixer.

1136
00:52:24,424 --> 00:52:25,759
You going to that thing?

1137
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,864
Yeah, of course,
I go every year.

1138
00:52:27,865 --> 00:52:29,133
It's her big night.

1139
00:52:29,134 --> 00:52:30,735
Can we get two orders of wings

1140
00:52:30,736 --> 00:52:32,908
with fries and two sodas,
please?

1141
00:52:34,511 --> 00:52:36,781
Plus, there's gonna be
a chocolate fountain there.

1142
00:52:36,782 --> 00:52:39,587
Oh. Again with the chocolate!

1143
00:52:40,689 --> 00:52:41,690
Are you going?

1144
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:42,994
Who do you think's

1145
00:52:42,995 --> 00:52:45,155
getting suckered into carrying
that chocolate fountain?

1146
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,435
You know, I think
it would be kind of cool

1147
00:52:47,436 --> 00:52:49,506
if two people fell in love
at the mixer, you know?

1148
00:52:49,507 --> 00:52:50,842
Like, love at first sight?

1149
00:52:50,843 --> 00:52:52,779
Well, it happened
to my grandma and grandpa,

1150
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:54,650
so I think it's possible.

1151
00:52:54,651 --> 00:52:55,752
Number 11!

1152
00:52:55,753 --> 00:52:57,289
What about Mr. Denver?

1153
00:52:57,290 --> 00:52:59,493
Was that love at first sight?

1154
00:52:59,494 --> 00:53:03,034
Ha! Uh, not really.

1155
00:53:03,035 --> 00:53:07,175
It wasn't that "Cupid's arrow
hitting you in the chest"

1156
00:53:07,176 --> 00:53:09,480
head‐over‐heels kind of love.

1157
00:53:09,481 --> 00:53:11,484
Poetic.

1158
00:53:11,485 --> 00:53:13,956
What can I say?
I dabble in poetry.

1159
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:15,358
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1160
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:16,393
Let's hear one.

1161
00:53:16,394 --> 00:53:17,997
Roses are red.

1162
00:53:17,998 --> 00:53:20,034
Violets are blue.

1163
00:53:20,035 --> 00:53:22,173
So far, so good.

1164
00:53:23,108 --> 00:53:24,443
I don't remember the rest.

1165
00:53:24,444 --> 00:53:26,213
Oh, come on.

1166
00:53:26,214 --> 00:53:27,349
Sorry.

1167
00:53:27,350 --> 00:53:28,851
Okay, my turn.

1168
00:53:28,852 --> 00:53:30,755
Let's hear it, Shakespeare.

1169
00:53:30,756 --> 00:53:32,492
Roses are red.

1170
00:53:32,493 --> 00:53:34,229
Violets...

1171
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:35,331
are blue.

1172
00:53:35,332 --> 00:53:36,400
Okay.

1173
00:53:36,401 --> 00:53:38,337
I don't know
about music therapy...

1174
00:53:38,338 --> 00:53:39,373
No, you don't.

1175
00:53:39,374 --> 00:53:41,278
But I think
I'm coming around on you.

1176
00:53:42,713 --> 00:53:43,814
How'd I do?

1177
00:53:43,815 --> 00:53:45,318
I think that was
too many syllables.

1178
00:53:45,319 --> 00:53:48,292
I'm pretty sure
that was iambic pentameter.

1179
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:53,668
Oh, I think
I remember my poem now.

1180
00:53:53,669 --> 00:53:54,971
Oh, yeah?

1181
00:53:54,972 --> 00:53:56,372
- Mm‐hmm.
- It's never gonna top mine.

1182
00:53:57,376 --> 00:53:58,411
Just wait.

1183
00:53:58,412 --> 00:53:59,814
See? Competitive.

1184
00:54:01,017 --> 00:54:02,385
Okay, roses are red.

1185
00:54:02,386 --> 00:54:04,991
- Okay.
- Violets are blue.

1186
00:54:04,992 --> 00:54:06,861
Doctors can be arrogant...

1187
00:54:06,862 --> 00:54:08,131
Hey!

1188
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,070
But their hearts can be true.

1189
00:54:11,071 --> 00:54:13,507
All right. Not bad.

1190
00:54:13,508 --> 00:54:15,044
Not bad?

1191
00:54:15,045 --> 00:54:16,847
That was spectacular.

1192
00:54:16,848 --> 00:54:18,451
"Spectacular"
might be a bit much.

1193
00:54:18,452 --> 00:54:21,423
Okay, well, it was marvelous,
at the very least.

1194
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:22,692
Satisfactory.

1195
00:54:22,693 --> 00:54:23,996
"Satisfactory"?

1196
00:54:23,997 --> 00:54:25,431
Hey!
You're blocking the movie!

1197
00:54:25,432 --> 00:54:26,301
Sorry!

1198
00:54:26,302 --> 00:54:27,870
We forgot the popcorn.

1199
00:54:27,871 --> 00:54:30,042
The popcorn! Right!

1200
00:54:31,111 --> 00:54:32,579
Hey, Grams, be right back.

1201
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:34,684
- Just getting some popcorn.
- Free popcorn.

1202
00:55:11,358 --> 00:55:12,826
Surprise!

1203
00:55:12,827 --> 00:55:14,529
What are you doing here?

1204
00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:17,168
I started to make
Valentine's Day cookies,

1205
00:55:17,169 --> 00:55:20,108
but the idea of making
V‐Day cookies all by myself

1206
00:55:20,109 --> 00:55:21,745
felt too depressing.

1207
00:55:23,782 --> 00:55:25,451
What's wrong? You look off.

1208
00:55:25,452 --> 00:55:27,489
What? Nothing.

1209
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,961
Mm‐hmm.

1210
00:55:29,962 --> 00:55:32,499
I guess I'm feeling a little...

1211
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,136
confused.

1212
00:55:34,137 --> 00:55:36,774
Oh. Is this about
Dr. McHandsome?

1213
00:55:36,775 --> 00:55:38,644
N‐No.

1214
00:55:38,645 --> 00:55:39,881
No.

1215
00:55:39,882 --> 00:55:41,483
What's there
to be confused about?

1216
00:55:41,484 --> 00:55:44,357
I guess I just‐‐
I wasn't expecting to...

1217
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:46,860
I wasn't looking for...

1218
00:55:46,861 --> 00:55:47,997
Love?

1219
00:55:47,998 --> 00:55:50,068
What? No.

1220
00:55:50,069 --> 00:55:52,172
Nobody said anything about love.

1221
00:55:52,173 --> 00:55:54,142
I just...
you know what I think it is?

1222
00:55:54,143 --> 00:55:56,513
I think that it's all this
Valentine's Day stuff.

1223
00:55:56,514 --> 00:55:58,217
It's just getting to my head.
That's it.

1224
00:55:58,218 --> 00:56:00,154
Okay, well,
forget about all this.

1225
00:56:00,155 --> 00:56:02,893
Because we...

1226
00:56:02,894 --> 00:56:05,499
we have to break some hearts.

1227
00:56:06,568 --> 00:56:07,635
- Okay.
- Shh.

1228
00:56:07,636 --> 00:56:08,671
It's okay, it's okay.

1229
00:56:08,672 --> 00:56:10,708
Shh. Des, no.
This is a terrible idea.

1230
00:56:10,709 --> 00:56:12,545
No, it's totally fine, okay?
We'll be super‐quiet.

1231
00:56:12,546 --> 00:56:14,584
No one will never know
we were here.

1232
00:56:17,223 --> 00:56:19,226
Oh!

1233
00:56:19,227 --> 00:56:20,795
Stop. Where'd it go?

1234
00:56:20,796 --> 00:56:21,831
Excuse me?

1235
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:28,244
Cookies?

1236
00:56:28,245 --> 00:56:30,014
My issue is

1237
00:56:30,015 --> 00:56:31,417
I've got plenty of matches
on Love‐Link,

1238
00:56:31,418 --> 00:56:32,819
but the minute I get passionate

1239
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:35,224
and start talking about how much
I love flowers and romance,

1240
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:36,560
they disappear.

1241
00:56:36,561 --> 00:56:38,097
Do you think

1242
00:56:38,098 --> 00:56:39,633
I'm scaring away my soulmate?

1243
00:56:39,634 --> 00:56:42,205
We didn't have
all this crazy technology

1244
00:56:42,206 --> 00:56:43,474
when I was dating,

1245
00:56:43,475 --> 00:56:46,681
and I certainly had
my fair share of, um...

1246
00:56:47,951 --> 00:56:51,090
"love links,"
I think it was.

1247
00:56:51,091 --> 00:56:53,361
But this is what I learned,
Desiree‐‐

1248
00:56:53,362 --> 00:56:56,869
you cannot scare away
your soulmate.

1249
00:56:57,971 --> 00:56:59,473
You just can't.

1250
00:56:59,474 --> 00:57:03,147
The right one will love you
just the way you are.

1251
00:57:03,148 --> 00:57:06,688
Wow. You're so intuitive,
Mary Anne.

1252
00:57:10,362 --> 00:57:13,300
Maybe you could help Violet
with...

1253
00:57:13,301 --> 00:57:15,606
her love life.

1254
00:57:17,076 --> 00:57:18,979
What's up, Violet?
Let's hear it.

1255
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:20,148
Violet

1256
00:57:20,149 --> 00:57:22,152
has this...

1257
00:57:22,153 --> 00:57:23,721
- Friend.
- Mm‐hmm... Friend.

1258
00:57:23,722 --> 00:57:24,756
A friend...

1259
00:57:24,757 --> 00:57:27,796
that you want
to be more than a friend?

1260
00:57:27,797 --> 00:57:33,240
Well, up until recently,
I really disliked him.

1261
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:35,278
Mm‐hmm. What changed?

1262
00:57:35,279 --> 00:57:38,617
It's like he has this tough
outer‐shell around him.

1263
00:57:38,618 --> 00:57:40,221
Like a candy?

1264
00:57:40,222 --> 00:57:41,457
But on the inside, he's...

1265
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,227
Sweet and wonderful?

1266
00:57:43,228 --> 00:57:44,897
Something like that.

1267
00:57:44,898 --> 00:57:46,133
Mm.

1268
00:57:46,134 --> 00:57:47,335
It's just the more that I learn,

1269
00:57:47,336 --> 00:57:49,339
the more I seem...

1270
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:51,945
[to not dislike him
as much as I thought I did.

1271
00:57:51,946 --> 00:57:53,180
Oh.

1272
00:57:53,181 --> 00:57:54,749
So what are you waiting for?

1273
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:56,620
I think she's scared.

1274
00:57:56,621 --> 00:57:58,224
You know I'm sitting right here?

1275
00:57:58,225 --> 00:57:59,793
I'm just saying!

1276
00:57:59,794 --> 00:58:04,469
Okay, so. So, you are the girl
who takes care of everyone else,

1277
00:58:04,470 --> 00:58:06,975
but won't allow
her own soulmate in?

1278
00:58:06,976 --> 00:58:08,912
Is that it?

1279
00:58:08,913 --> 00:58:11,885
Oh! She is so wise.

1280
00:58:11,886 --> 00:58:14,891
My advice?

1281
00:58:14,892 --> 00:58:17,363
Listen to your heart.

1282
00:58:37,816 --> 00:58:39,017
Did you make these?

1283
00:58:39,018 --> 00:58:41,121
You know, I can't believe
I'm actually saying this,

1284
00:58:41,122 --> 00:58:42,123
but yes.

1285
00:58:42,124 --> 00:58:43,426
I baked cookies.

1286
00:58:43,427 --> 00:58:45,230
Do you want one?

1287
00:58:45,231 --> 00:58:46,231
Yes!

1288
00:58:51,108 --> 00:58:53,713
Dr. Williams,
you've gotta try these.

1289
00:58:53,714 --> 00:58:55,550
Did I just hear that correctly?

1290
00:58:55,551 --> 00:58:56,819
You're baking now?

1291
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:58,189
I learned from the best.

1292
00:58:59,426 --> 00:59:00,594
Let's see here.

1293
00:59:00,595 --> 00:59:02,699
Um... anatomically incorrect.

1294
00:59:05,304 --> 00:59:06,572
Mm.

1295
00:59:06,573 --> 00:59:09,379
Almost good enough to make me
a Valentine's Day believer.

1296
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:13,151
So what brings you in?
Trying to make some new friends?

1297
00:59:13,152 --> 00:59:16,124
Well. I just finished
a double session with Charles

1298
00:59:16,125 --> 00:59:17,928
since the deadline
is around the corner.

1299
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:19,097
Did you need me to come back?

1300
00:59:19,098 --> 00:59:20,199
I could get someone
to cover my shift.

1301
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,103
No, no, no.
Your patients need you.

1302
00:59:22,104 --> 00:59:24,275
And Charles is actually
doing really great.

1303
00:59:24,276 --> 00:59:26,280
Mm.

1304
00:59:27,549 --> 00:59:30,620
I actually stopped by tonight
because...

1305
00:59:30,621 --> 00:59:32,892
Why don't we, uh,
step over here for a minute?

1306
00:59:35,298 --> 00:59:37,202
What's up?

1307
00:59:39,306 --> 00:59:40,208
I was thinking‐‐

1308
00:59:40,209 --> 00:59:43,681
Mm? Yeah, well,
that's a good start.

1309
00:59:44,616 --> 00:59:46,552
Maybe we could go

1310
00:59:46,553 --> 00:59:48,656
to the O Fish Ally
Singles Mixer.

1311
00:59:48,657 --> 00:59:51,362
Yeah. We already
talked about that.

1312
00:59:51,363 --> 00:59:52,464
Together.

1313
00:59:52,465 --> 00:59:54,736
Oh.

1314
00:59:59,479 --> 01:00:01,047
As colleagues.

1315
01:00:01,048 --> 01:00:02,517
Oh.

1316
01:00:02,518 --> 01:00:04,488
- Yeah.
- Colleagues.

1317
01:00:04,489 --> 01:00:05,557
As colleagues.

1318
01:00:05,558 --> 01:00:07,126
You know,
we could drive together.

1319
01:00:07,127 --> 01:00:08,496
Save some gas.

1320
01:00:08,497 --> 01:00:09,632
- Mm.
- What do you think?

1321
01:00:09,633 --> 01:00:12,371
Okay. Sure.

1322
01:00:12,372 --> 01:00:13,274
Great.

1323
01:00:13,275 --> 01:00:15,944
Great. Well,
I'll pick you up tonight.

1324
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:17,514
Perfect.

1325
01:00:17,515 --> 01:00:19,150
Well, enjoy the cookies.

1326
01:00:19,151 --> 01:00:20,821
Thank you. I will.

1327
01:00:22,258 --> 01:00:24,728
Bye.

1328
01:00:24,729 --> 01:00:26,833
"Save some gas"?

1329
01:00:29,171 --> 01:00:30,073
Just for the‐‐

1330
01:00:30,074 --> 01:00:31,943
Hi! Hi. Yeah.
The fountain's not here yet.

1331
01:00:31,944 --> 01:00:33,145
<i>Wait, what do you mean?</i>

1332
01:00:33,146 --> 01:00:34,715
And I already tried calling
the chocolate shop,

1333
01:00:34,716 --> 01:00:36,819
and no one answered and I have

1334
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:37,988
<i>the perfect spot for it,</i>

1335
01:00:37,989 --> 01:00:39,359
<i>but, uh, it's not here, so...</i>

1336
01:00:40,328 --> 01:00:42,497
Your chocolate fountain
is on its way.

1337
01:00:42,498 --> 01:00:44,235
It better be.

1338
01:00:50,013 --> 01:00:51,114
Oh, hey.

1339
01:00:51,115 --> 01:00:52,250
Hi.

1340
01:00:52,251 --> 01:00:54,120
Max is heading
in the same direction,

1341
01:00:54,121 --> 01:00:56,292
so I figured we could just
all drive together.

1342
01:00:56,293 --> 01:00:58,731
You know.
Save on gas.

1343
01:01:00,434 --> 01:01:01,937
Sure.

1344
01:01:09,452 --> 01:01:11,255
Hey, you got any tunes?

1345
01:01:11,256 --> 01:01:13,292
Uh, yeah.

1346
01:01:13,293 --> 01:01:14,329
Here you go.

1347
01:01:16,233 --> 01:01:17,402
Really?

1348
01:01:18,537 --> 01:01:20,172
Yeah... why?

1349
01:01:20,173 --> 01:01:21,609
Nothing.

1350
01:01:21,610 --> 01:01:23,413
I just didn't expect that.

1351
01:01:23,414 --> 01:01:25,384
I like it.

1352
01:01:26,687 --> 01:01:29,325
Can't we just enjoy the ride...
quietly?

1353
01:01:29,326 --> 01:01:31,094
What? No. No, no, no.

1354
01:01:31,095 --> 01:01:32,731
We gotta get pumped up
for this party, man. Come on.

1355
01:01:32,732 --> 01:01:34,468
To this?

1356
01:01:34,469 --> 01:01:36,472
Okay, fine. Here.

1357
01:01:36,473 --> 01:01:37,574
Is this better?

1358
01:01:37,575 --> 01:01:39,912
<i>Coming up next,
one of my personal favorites.</i>

1359
01:01:39,913 --> 01:01:42,183
Oh, yeah! Yeah‐yeah‐yeah‐yeah!
I love this song.

1360
01:01:42,184 --> 01:01:43,553
Turn it up.

1361
01:01:43,554 --> 01:01:44,822

- No, that's not cardboard.

1373
01:02:27,241 --> 01:02:31,382
"O Fish Ally Single Mixer."
I love that name.

1374
01:02:31,383 --> 01:02:32,784
You do?

1375
01:02:32,785 --> 01:02:34,254
Yeah!

1376
01:02:34,255 --> 01:02:35,690
Des!

1377
01:02:35,691 --> 01:02:37,528
You made it.
Happy Valentine's Day Eve.

1378
01:02:40,133 --> 01:02:43,639
You remember Donna,
my old classmate?

1379
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:45,477
- She flew in just for the party.
- Hi.

1380
01:02:45,478 --> 01:02:47,012
I wouldn't miss it.

1381
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:49,652
Ah! Your dress!

1382
01:02:51,590 --> 01:02:54,228
So, Des, tell me‐‐

1383
01:02:54,229 --> 01:02:55,730
uh...

1384
01:02:55,731 --> 01:02:57,268
Don't tell me.
Excuse me.

1385
01:02:59,472 --> 01:03:00,774
Happy Valentine's Day Eve.

1386
01:03:00,775 --> 01:03:02,344
Your fountain...

1387
01:03:02,345 --> 01:03:03,947
has arrived.

1388
01:03:05,551 --> 01:03:07,455
- Oh...
- Yeah.

1389
01:03:08,557 --> 01:03:09,658
Oh, my God.

1390
01:03:09,659 --> 01:03:11,262
He looks amazing.

1391
01:03:11,263 --> 01:03:12,264
Who, Blake?

1392
01:03:12,265 --> 01:03:13,300
No. Him.

1393
01:03:14,602 --> 01:03:15,938
Max?

1394
01:03:16,773 --> 01:03:17,808
That's Max?

1395
01:03:17,809 --> 01:03:19,611
Yeah, that's Blake's brother.

1396
01:03:19,612 --> 01:03:20,947
Blake has a brother?

1397
01:03:20,948 --> 01:03:23,619
So, where do you
want this thing?

1398
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:25,223
Uh...

1399
01:03:25,224 --> 01:03:27,694
I think you can
just put it over there.

1400
01:03:27,695 --> 01:03:29,232
Cool.

1401
01:03:30,166 --> 01:03:33,239
Hello?

1402
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,608
<i>Hello.</i>

1403
01:03:34,609 --> 01:03:36,313
Hi.

1404
01:03:37,482 --> 01:03:38,950
Uh, w‐who is that?

1405
01:03:38,951 --> 01:03:40,588
Who, Desiree?

1406
01:03:41,623 --> 01:03:42,623
Excuse me.

1407
01:03:44,429 --> 01:03:47,367
Well, if you didn't believe
in love at first sight before...

1408
01:03:47,368 --> 01:03:48,437
Yeah, no kidding.

1409
01:03:50,875 --> 01:03:52,042
Look at them‐‐

1410
01:03:52,043 --> 01:03:53,713
not a worry in the world.

1411
01:03:53,714 --> 01:03:56,219
You say that like you've got
something on your mind.

1412
01:03:58,457 --> 01:04:01,229
I have one day left to get
your grandfather to speak.

1413
01:04:02,398 --> 01:04:06,004
Listen, you have made
excellent progress with him.

1414
01:04:06,005 --> 01:04:07,808
I'm sure my grandmother
and great‐aunt

1415
01:04:07,809 --> 01:04:10,214
will be happy regardless.

1416
01:04:11,516 --> 01:04:13,387
I hope so.

1417
01:04:34,395 --> 01:04:36,632
Uh... you wanna‐‐

1418
01:04:36,633 --> 01:04:38,134
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1419
01:04:38,135 --> 01:04:40,441
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1420
01:04:41,543 --> 01:04:43,044
Is this okay?

1421
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:44,482
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1422
01:04:47,755 --> 01:04:49,958
So, um...

1423
01:04:49,959 --> 01:04:52,797
tell me how you got to be
so incredible.

1424
01:04:52,798 --> 01:04:54,669
At‐at‐at all this.

1425
01:04:55,771 --> 01:04:57,374
Honestly,

1426
01:04:57,375 --> 01:04:59,176
it started
at the farmer's market,

1427
01:04:59,177 --> 01:05:01,782
and I met this cute
married couple with a farm

1428
01:05:01,783 --> 01:05:05,155
who had to throw away
their extra flowers every week,

1429
01:05:05,156 --> 01:05:07,126
so I volunteered
to deliver the extras

1430
01:05:07,127 --> 01:05:09,731
to the local hospital,
which is where I met Violet,

1431
01:05:09,732 --> 01:05:11,468
and then I realized,

1432
01:05:11,469 --> 01:05:15,276
I could support
local farmers' work

1433
01:05:15,277 --> 01:05:17,314
if I opened up my own shop

1434
01:05:17,315 --> 01:05:19,751
and only sourced local flowers,

1435
01:05:19,752 --> 01:05:21,589
and, yeah,

1436
01:05:21,590 --> 01:05:22,824
and then the business
ended up taking off,

1437
01:05:22,825 --> 01:05:24,228
and now everybody's winning,

1438
01:05:24,229 --> 01:05:25,730
and I basically get to do
what I love every day,

1439
01:05:25,731 --> 01:05:27,634
which is work with flowers
and support romance,

1440
01:05:27,635 --> 01:05:31,609
and do you possibly just want
to run away right now?

1441
01:05:31,610 --> 01:05:33,279
Oh, no. No way.

1442
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:35,283
I mean, that‐that is incredible.

1443
01:05:35,284 --> 01:05:37,487
I mean it, seriously.

1444
01:05:37,488 --> 01:05:40,293
You're doing
what you're passionate about,

1445
01:05:40,294 --> 01:05:42,030
while you're helping
the community.

1446
01:05:43,233 --> 01:05:46,606
Exactly. You get it.

1447
01:05:54,555 --> 01:05:57,093
Oh! Man down.

1448
01:05:58,397 --> 01:06:01,000
It's a little more complicated
than I thought.

1449
01:06:01,001 --> 01:06:02,871
Tell me about it.

1450
01:06:02,872 --> 01:06:05,108
At least love
is in the air tonight.

1451
01:06:05,109 --> 01:06:06,612
Really?

1452
01:06:06,613 --> 01:06:07,481
For some.

1453
01:06:07,482 --> 01:06:08,950
I think
Desiree can start planning

1454
01:06:08,951 --> 01:06:09,886
the flower arrangements now.

1455
01:06:09,887 --> 01:06:12,590
Ah. Right.

1456
01:06:12,591 --> 01:06:15,564
I don't think I've ever seen
Max like anything that much.

1457
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:18,669
Well, except chocolate.

1458
01:06:18,670 --> 01:06:20,840
Do you believe two people
are meant to be together,

1459
01:06:20,841 --> 01:06:22,076
like your grandpa and grandma?

1460
01:06:22,077 --> 01:06:24,815
What?
You mean, like, soulmates?

1461
01:06:24,816 --> 01:06:25,950
Yeah.

1462
01:06:25,951 --> 01:06:28,121
Two people destined
to find each other,

1463
01:06:28,122 --> 01:06:30,760
and no matter how hard
they try to mess it up,

1464
01:06:30,761 --> 01:06:33,198
inevitably, they end up together
in the end,

1465
01:06:33,199 --> 01:06:36,070
because it's written
in the stars, or something.

1466
01:06:36,071 --> 01:06:37,575
Doesn't sound very logical.

1467
01:06:39,044 --> 01:06:40,847
What do you mean?

1468
01:06:40,848 --> 01:06:42,484
What if one person
lives in Boston,

1469
01:06:42,485 --> 01:06:44,821
and the other person lives in...

1470
01:06:44,822 --> 01:06:46,358
Stockbridge?

1471
01:06:46,359 --> 01:06:49,998
I was gonna say London
or Tahiti.

1472
01:06:49,999 --> 01:06:52,136
But sure.

1473
01:06:52,137 --> 01:06:53,639
I mean, how are they
supposed to meet,

1474
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:56,211
let alone fall in love?

1475
01:06:56,212 --> 01:06:58,683
Well, I think that's where
the destiny part comes in.

1476
01:06:58,684 --> 01:07:01,722
Hmm.

1477
01:07:01,723 --> 01:07:02,625
So you don't believe in

1478
01:07:02,626 --> 01:07:04,160
the romantic notion
of soulmates?

1479
01:07:04,161 --> 01:07:05,797
I don't know, maybe.

1480
01:07:05,798 --> 01:07:08,302
But I don't believe in destiny
like you're describing it.

1481
01:07:08,303 --> 01:07:11,408
I like to believe
that there's free will,

1482
01:07:11,409 --> 01:07:14,514
and that one of these people
from Boston or London or...

1483
01:07:14,515 --> 01:07:15,616
Stockbridge.

1484
01:07:15,617 --> 01:07:18,823
One of these people will
make a choice at some point.

1485
01:07:18,824 --> 01:07:21,729
Take action.

1486
01:07:21,730 --> 01:07:23,867
Tell the other person
how they feel.

1487
01:07:28,042 --> 01:07:29,277
But what do I know?

1488
01:07:29,278 --> 01:07:31,648
You know,
I only operate on hearts.

1489
01:07:31,649 --> 01:07:34,922
I don't claim to know
their secret wants and desires.

1490
01:07:36,593 --> 01:07:38,864
Hmm.

1491
01:07:40,367 --> 01:07:42,537
Will you excuse me a second?

1492
01:07:42,538 --> 01:07:44,475
Yeah.

1493
01:07:48,617 --> 01:07:50,753
I bought a frog desk,
and I named it "Bubble"...

1494
01:07:50,754 --> 01:07:52,791
Hi, Violet.
What's up?

1495
01:07:52,792 --> 01:07:54,126
I'm sorry.
Can we talk?

1496
01:07:54,127 --> 01:07:56,064
Oh, yeah, of course.

1497
01:07:56,065 --> 01:07:57,901
I will be right back.

1498
01:07:57,902 --> 01:07:59,638
Okay.

1499
01:07:59,639 --> 01:08:03,178
I know I said that this was
the year that you fall in love,

1500
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:05,550
but I think it might be my year.

1501
01:08:05,551 --> 01:08:07,487
I think it might be
both of our years.

1502
01:08:07,488 --> 01:08:08,956
What? Dr. Blake
finally admitted

1503
01:08:08,957 --> 01:08:09,958
he's in love with you?

1504
01:08:09,959 --> 01:08:11,562
Well, no. Not exactly.

1505
01:08:11,563 --> 01:08:14,501
But I think
I'm gonna do it tonight.

1506
01:08:14,502 --> 01:08:16,805
I'm gonna tell him how I feel.

1507
01:08:16,806 --> 01:08:18,275
Oh!

1508
01:08:18,276 --> 01:08:20,036
Violet, you're finally
opening up your heart.

1509
01:08:21,216 --> 01:08:23,819
Yeah,
and it's really uncomfortable.

1510
01:08:23,820 --> 01:08:26,225
Well, that's how you know
you're growing.

1511
01:08:26,226 --> 01:08:27,594
Thanks.

1512
01:08:27,595 --> 01:08:30,333
Or at least that's what
Mary Anne says, anyways.

1513
01:08:30,334 --> 01:08:32,370
We're friends now.
We text.

1514
01:08:32,371 --> 01:08:33,539
- Yeah?
- Mm‐hmm.

1515
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:34,409
Okay.

1516
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:36,412
- Deep breath.
- Okay.

1517
01:08:36,413 --> 01:08:37,881
You're doing the right thing.

1518
01:08:37,882 --> 01:08:38,983
Mm‐hmm.

1519
01:08:38,984 --> 01:08:42,156
I know you better than
anybody else on this planet.

1520
01:08:42,157 --> 01:08:43,626
You deserve to be loved.

1521
01:08:43,627 --> 01:08:44,595
- Okay.
- Okay?

1522
01:08:44,595 --> 01:08:45,531
Okay.

1523
01:08:45,532 --> 01:08:47,834
Now, you're gonna
march over there‐‐

1524
01:08:47,835 --> 01:08:49,103
Mm‐hmm.

1525
01:08:49,104 --> 01:08:50,506
And you're gonna say,
"Dr. Blake" ‐‐

1526
01:08:50,507 --> 01:08:51,575
I don't call him that.

1527
01:08:51,576 --> 01:08:53,111
It doesn't matter.
I like how it sounds.

1528
01:08:53,112 --> 01:08:54,414
- Okay. Okay.
- All right? Okay.

1529
01:08:54,415 --> 01:08:57,554
"Dr. Blake, I am
falling in love with you."

1530
01:08:57,555 --> 01:09:00,461
I am falling‐‐

1531
01:09:01,329 --> 01:09:02,363
"In love..."

1532
01:09:02,364 --> 01:09:03,833
- In love.
- "...With you."

1533
01:09:03,834 --> 01:09:05,336
With you.
"I'm falling in love with you."

1534
01:09:05,337 --> 01:09:06,738
Exactly. See?
There's nothing to it.

1535
01:09:06,739 --> 01:09:07,641
You can do this.

1536
01:09:07,642 --> 01:09:08,709
I can do this!

1537
01:09:08,710 --> 01:09:09,645
Yes!

1538
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:10,780
What if he doesn't
feel the same?

1539
01:09:10,781 --> 01:09:11,616
Are you kidding me?

1540
01:09:11,617 --> 01:09:14,086
I've seen the way
he looks at you.

1541
01:09:14,087 --> 01:09:15,523
How?

1542
01:09:15,524 --> 01:09:17,595
Like you're the only woman
in the world.

1543
01:09:22,036 --> 01:09:23,973
Are you ready...

1544
01:09:23,974 --> 01:09:26,078
to give your final carnation?

1545
01:09:28,182 --> 01:09:29,317
I am.

1546
01:09:29,318 --> 01:09:31,221
That's my girl.

1547
01:09:31,222 --> 01:09:32,290
Okay. I'm doing it.

1548
01:09:32,291 --> 01:09:34,394
- Okay, you got this. Go, team!
- Go, team.

1549
01:09:34,395 --> 01:09:36,331
Thanks for the pep talk.

1550
01:09:36,332 --> 01:09:38,035
- Oh, I love you.
- Love you.

1551
01:09:46,305 --> 01:09:47,606
Uh, Donna, hi‐‐

1552
01:09:47,607 --> 01:09:49,911
Oh, Violet‐‐

1553
01:09:49,912 --> 01:09:53,651
there are so many men
at this party.

1554
01:09:53,652 --> 01:09:55,691
How is a girl to choose?

1555
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:59,096
Uh, speaking of men‐‐

1556
01:09:59,097 --> 01:10:01,334
did you see where the man
that was standing here went?

1557
01:10:01,335 --> 01:10:03,037
Was he tall?

1558
01:10:03,038 --> 01:10:03,873
Yeah.

1559
01:10:03,874 --> 01:10:06,210
Handsome,
like he could be in a movie?

1560
01:10:06,211 --> 01:10:07,646
Yeah. That's him.

1561
01:10:07,647 --> 01:10:09,116
Yeah.

1562
01:10:09,117 --> 01:10:10,721
He's over there
with that blonde woman.

1563
01:10:11,789 --> 01:10:13,292
Oh! She is gorgeous.

1564
01:10:15,129 --> 01:10:17,801
Should've made your move sooner.

1565
01:10:18,837 --> 01:10:22,176
I mean, she's the definition
of perfection.

1566
01:10:59,584 --> 01:11:00,853
Violet?

1567
01:11:00,854 --> 01:11:02,422
I'm at my brother's house.

1568
01:11:02,423 --> 01:11:03,424
<i>Oh, Professor. Hi.</i>

1569
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:05,796
Listen, I know that I said

1570
01:11:05,797 --> 01:11:07,365
he would be speaking
by Valentine's Day,

1571
01:11:07,366 --> 01:11:09,436
but I have a whole day
with him still,

1572
01:11:09,437 --> 01:11:10,406
and I think that‐‐

1573
01:11:10,407 --> 01:11:11,708
Uh, no.

1574
01:11:11,709 --> 01:11:13,511
I'm calling to congratulate you.

1575
01:11:13,512 --> 01:11:15,348
You are?

1576
01:11:15,349 --> 01:11:17,920
<i>I know the assignment
was to get him to speak again,</i>

1577
01:11:17,921 --> 01:11:20,058
but... look at him!

1578
01:11:20,059 --> 01:11:23,064
I haven't seen my brother
this happy in a year.

1579
01:11:23,065 --> 01:11:25,301
<i>And he's playing again.</i>

1580
01:11:25,302 --> 01:11:28,541
<i>You did
an outstanding job, Violet.</i>

1581
01:11:28,542 --> 01:11:29,643
<i>In fact,</i>

1582
01:11:29,644 --> 01:11:32,984
I've already placed a call
to the university hospital.

1583
01:11:32,985 --> 01:11:34,721
You're graduating.

1584
01:11:34,722 --> 01:11:36,323
<i>You've got the job.</i>

1585
01:11:36,324 --> 01:11:39,296
I don't know what to say.

1586
01:11:39,297 --> 01:11:40,900
Say yes.

1587
01:11:40,901 --> 01:11:42,837
<i>That's your dream, isn't it?</i>

1588
01:11:42,838 --> 01:11:44,808
<i>And take tomorrow off‐‐</i>

1589
01:11:44,809 --> 01:11:47,079
Mary Anne can get
your things together.

1590
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:48,381
I'm sure you have someone

1591
01:11:48,382 --> 01:11:50,886
who would love to spend
Valentine's Day with you.

1592
01:11:50,887 --> 01:11:53,658
<i>- Melinda!
- I have to go.</i>

1593
01:11:53,659 --> 01:11:56,097
We're about to play
Valentine's Day‐themed Scrabble.

1594
01:11:56,098 --> 01:11:58,802
I get very competitive when
I'm playing against my brother.

1595
01:11:58,803 --> 01:12:00,139
Take care.

1596
01:12:17,673 --> 01:12:18,776
Let me get that.

1597
01:12:18,777 --> 01:12:19,911
Thanks.

1598
01:12:19,912 --> 01:12:20,980
Uh, hey, buddy.
Just keep it running.

1599
01:12:20,981 --> 01:12:22,082
I'll be right back.

1600
01:12:22,083 --> 01:12:24,286
Violet?
What are you doing here?

1601
01:12:24,287 --> 01:12:26,524
You okay?

1602
01:12:26,525 --> 01:12:27,626
Yeah.

1603
01:12:27,627 --> 01:12:29,898
You know what? I'll just...
I'll see you tomorrow.

1604
01:12:29,899 --> 01:12:33,204
Sure. Thanks for the fun night.

1605
01:12:33,205 --> 01:12:34,741
That was‐‐ that was the best.

1606
01:12:34,742 --> 01:12:36,745
I'll call you?

1607
01:12:36,746 --> 01:12:38,683
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1608
01:12:40,186 --> 01:12:42,990
Okay.

1609
01:12:42,991 --> 01:12:44,962
- Bye!
- Bye.

1610
01:12:49,337 --> 01:12:51,141
- Hey.
- Hi.

1611
01:12:52,878 --> 01:12:54,247
What happened?

1612
01:12:55,216 --> 01:12:56,650
I don't want to talk about it.

1613
01:12:56,651 --> 01:12:58,622
Yes, you do.

1614
01:13:00,894 --> 01:13:03,331
He doesn't feel the same.

1615
01:13:03,332 --> 01:13:04,400
Oh.

1616
01:13:10,780 --> 01:13:12,282
You know what they say?

1617
01:13:12,283 --> 01:13:15,289
A carton of ice cream a day
keeps the doctor away.

1618
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:18,929
- Too soon?
- Mm‐hmm.

1619
01:13:18,930 --> 01:13:21,134
Too soon.

1620
01:13:22,938 --> 01:13:25,476
Thanks for this.

1621
01:13:26,979 --> 01:13:29,583
I really wanted to, Des.

1622
01:13:29,584 --> 01:13:32,022
I did. I...

1623
01:13:32,023 --> 01:13:35,028
tried to open up my heart,
like you said.

1624
01:13:35,029 --> 01:13:37,400
Now it's too late.

1625
01:13:40,740 --> 01:13:42,711
That'll be the pizza.

1626
01:13:46,752 --> 01:13:48,087
What are you doing here?

1627
01:13:48,088 --> 01:13:49,356
Can I talk to Violet?

1628
01:13:49,357 --> 01:13:51,228
Violet doesn't want
to talk to you right now.

1629
01:13:52,630 --> 01:13:54,200
Des?

1630
01:13:59,010 --> 01:14:00,412
It's okay.

1631
01:14:06,224 --> 01:14:09,998
I assume Max told you
where you could find me?

1632
01:14:09,999 --> 01:14:11,533
When I realized you left,

1633
01:14:11,534 --> 01:14:13,104
I caught a ride back
to my grandparents' house,

1634
01:14:13,105 --> 01:14:14,172
but you weren't there.

1635
01:14:14,173 --> 01:14:16,310
My grandmother
must have missed this

1636
01:14:16,311 --> 01:14:18,215
when she was packing up
your things.

1637
01:14:19,752 --> 01:14:21,621
I know how much it means to you.

1638
01:14:24,728 --> 01:14:26,431
Thank you.

1639
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:28,502
Can we talk?

1640
01:14:32,811 --> 01:14:34,080
Sure.

1641
01:14:39,490 --> 01:14:41,194
So why'd you leave
the mixer like that?

1642
01:14:42,965 --> 01:14:44,701
I don't know.

1643
01:14:44,702 --> 01:14:45,869
I was tired.

1644
01:14:45,870 --> 01:14:47,473
Violet.

1645
01:14:49,912 --> 01:14:51,748
I saw you.

1646
01:14:51,749 --> 01:14:53,284
With that beautiful blonde.

1647
01:14:53,285 --> 01:14:54,519
You had your arm around her.

1648
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:56,324
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What‐‐ what blonde?

1649
01:14:57,694 --> 01:14:58,895
You mean Charlotte?

1650
01:14:58,896 --> 01:15:00,064
I don't need to know her name.

1651
01:15:00,065 --> 01:15:01,600
We call her "Charlie."

1652
01:15:01,601 --> 01:15:02,601
After Grandpa Charlie.

1653
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:05,475
She's my cousin.

1654
01:15:05,476 --> 01:15:08,648
Who works at
the university hospital?

1655
01:15:08,649 --> 01:15:11,688
I was talking to her about
putting in a good word for you.

1656
01:15:11,689 --> 01:15:14,026
I mean, did you think
that she and I were...?

1657
01:15:14,027 --> 01:15:15,295
No. No.

1658
01:15:15,296 --> 01:15:16,931
‐Because that‐‐
‐I mean, even if you were,

1659
01:15:16,932 --> 01:15:18,434
why would I care?

1660
01:15:18,435 --> 01:15:19,704
Right.

1661
01:15:19,705 --> 01:15:21,941
Right!

1662
01:15:21,942 --> 01:15:23,713
So it was just
a huge misunderstanding?

1663
01:15:24,948 --> 01:15:28,621
Yeah, I‐‐ I think it is.

1664
01:15:28,622 --> 01:15:30,693
Ah.

1665
01:15:30,694 --> 01:15:32,362
Well, congratulations.

1666
01:15:32,363 --> 01:15:34,366
Heard about your job.

1667
01:15:34,367 --> 01:15:38,040
Oh, gosh, I almost... forgot.

1668
01:15:38,041 --> 01:15:41,246
Yeah, no, it's really exciting.

1669
01:15:41,247 --> 01:15:44,319
Their music‐therapy center
is second to none.

1670
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,390
I know you still don't
believe in what I do‐‐

1671
01:15:46,391 --> 01:15:47,760
Violet.

1672
01:15:47,761 --> 01:15:52,937
I still don't know
if I believe in music therapy...

1673
01:15:52,938 --> 01:15:54,908
but I believe in you.

1674
01:16:06,364 --> 01:16:08,434
I don't even know if
I believe in myself right now.

1675
01:16:08,435 --> 01:16:10,471
What?
What are you talking about?

1676
01:16:10,472 --> 01:16:12,042
I‐‐ Look at all the good
you've done.

1677
01:16:12,043 --> 01:16:13,679
I gave your grandmother
my word‐‐

1678
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:16,584
that I would have him
speaking by tomorrow.

1679
01:16:22,898 --> 01:16:25,536
And I'm gonna keep my word.

1680
01:16:26,504 --> 01:16:29,343
Okay. What can I do to help?

1681
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:31,848
Do you happen to have

1682
01:16:31,849 --> 01:16:34,519
your grandpa's old friend
Jimmy Golightly's number?

1683
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:35,588
No.

1684
01:16:35,589 --> 01:16:38,094
But I know where he hangs out.

1685
01:16:38,095 --> 01:16:40,966
Him and the boys still play
at the old jazz club in town.

1686
01:16:40,967 --> 01:16:42,703
Huh!

1687
01:16:42,704 --> 01:16:44,207
Perfect.

1688
01:16:55,491 --> 01:16:57,094
Do you like it?

1689
01:16:57,095 --> 01:16:59,064
I love it.

1690
01:16:59,065 --> 01:17:01,068
Hey! Hi.

1691
01:17:01,069 --> 01:17:02,939
Hey, this was such a great idea.

1692
01:17:02,940 --> 01:17:04,141
Thanks.

1693
01:17:04,142 --> 01:17:05,443
Have you seen your brother?

1694
01:17:05,444 --> 01:17:07,447
Yeah, he texted me‐‐
he's stuck at the hospital.

1695
01:17:07,448 --> 01:17:09,418
Okay. Uh...

1696
01:17:09,419 --> 01:17:10,554
I guess I'll go stall them.

1697
01:17:16,767 --> 01:17:17,635
- Hi.
- Hi.

1698
01:17:17,636 --> 01:17:19,204
- You want to go sit?
- Yeah.

1699
01:17:19,205 --> 01:17:20,775
'Kay.

1700
01:17:23,247 --> 01:17:24,448
Hi, everyone!

1701
01:17:24,449 --> 01:17:28,022
Thank you for coming
to Mr. and Mrs. Carver's

1702
01:17:28,023 --> 01:17:31,595
Valentine's Day 50th
Wedding Anniversary celebration.

1703
01:17:31,596 --> 01:17:34,134
Whoo!

1704
01:17:34,135 --> 01:17:35,570
Sing something!

1705
01:17:35,571 --> 01:17:37,274
Yeah! Sing something!

1706
01:17:37,275 --> 01:17:39,545
Um...

1707
01:17:39,546 --> 01:17:41,882
uh, well, I guess I could,

1708
01:17:41,883 --> 01:17:46,560
but only because the main act
is running a little bit late.

1709
01:17:51,837 --> 01:17:54,008
Have you ever heard her
sing before?

1710
01:17:54,009 --> 01:17:55,410
No. Never. Why?

1711
01:17:55,411 --> 01:17:58,249
You're in for a treat.

1712
01:17:58,250 --> 01:18:00,086
This is an original song

1713
01:18:00,087 --> 01:18:03,326
and it was actually
written by my grandmother

1714
01:18:03,327 --> 01:18:05,564
and it's called "11:11."

1715
01:18:06,968 --> 01:18:08,302
Tonight,

1716
01:18:08,303 --> 01:18:10,073
I want to dedicate this

1717
01:18:10,074 --> 01:18:12,979
to that beautiful couple
sitting in the front row.

1718
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:17,187
They just celebrated
their 50th wedding anniversary.

1719
01:18:17,188 --> 01:18:20,293
I think I speak on behalf
of everybody in this room

1720
01:18:20,294 --> 01:18:21,896
when I say

1721
01:18:21,897 --> 01:18:28,945
that theirs is a really special
and inspirational relationship.

1722
01:18:31,116 --> 01:18:33,187
Whoo!

1723
01:18:34,389 --> 01:18:36,560
I hope you like this.

Boy, your voice is something.

1798
01:24:53,413 --> 01:24:55,016
Thanks, Garfunkel.

1799
01:24:55,017 --> 01:24:57,555
You, uh, happen to see the time?

1800
01:24:58,690 --> 01:25:01,396
Guess Grandma Louise
got a ticket to tonight's show.

1801
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:04,969
Hey, there's something‐‐

1802
01:25:04,970 --> 01:25:06,605
something I've been meaning
to tell you.

1803
01:25:06,606 --> 01:25:08,576
It might sound crazy,

1804
01:25:08,577 --> 01:25:11,215
because I know we've only known
each other for two weeks.

1805
01:25:11,216 --> 01:25:15,289
I know I said I don't believe
in any of that Cupid stuff,

1806
01:25:15,290 --> 01:25:17,660
and I'm pretty sure
<i>The Single Man</i>

1807
01:25:17,661 --> 01:25:20,166
is all scripted, anyway, so...

1808
01:25:20,167 --> 01:25:22,737
What I'm trying to say is, uh...

1809
01:25:22,738 --> 01:25:25,010
You're falling in love with me?

1810
01:25:27,748 --> 01:25:29,785
Yeah.
