It is great to be here

Wow!

28
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:57,915
It is so great to be here.
And I would...

00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:00,146
'Cause I was afraid I wasn't
gonna be able to make it,

30
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,256
'cause I thought I broke
my ribs, 'cause I'm an idiot.

31
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:06,858
Well, I bought my son
a trampoline.

Well, you know the rule.

36
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:16,118
The one that puts it together
gets to try it out first.

37
00:02:16,186 --> 00:02:17,469
He was off at school,

38
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:18,981
I got this thing
all put together,

39
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:21,267
I start to climb up on it,
my wife goes, "Hey, hey, hey.

40
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,369
"Why don't you wait for him
to get home from school?"

41
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:24,659

44
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,032
"Please."

45
00:02:31,101 --> 00:02:33,952
Yeah. I ain't that
big a idiot, all right?

46
00:02:34,838 --> 00:02:36,771
So I hop up on this trampoline,

47
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,017
I start jumpin' up and down,

48
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,374
it all came back to me.

49
00:02:39,443 --> 00:02:40,753
I said,
"Oh, I remember this."

50
00:02:40,777 --> 00:02:43,845
I started doing seat drops
and knee drops.

51
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:46,981
Yeah, then I got cocky.

52
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,362
I forgot one very important
thing about a trampoline.

53
00:02:49,386 --> 00:02:53,121
If you don't hit square,
you go up at an angle.

54
00:02:53,189 --> 00:02:56,258
And you don't come down
at that same angle.

55
00:02:56,326 --> 00:02:59,127
You come down at an equal
and opposite angle.

56
00:02:59,196 --> 00:03:00,712
Yeah, I'm 20 feet in the air,

57
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:04,016
now my high-school
geometry kicks in.

58
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:06,012
As I curl into
the fetal position

59
00:03:06,036 --> 00:03:07,914
and bang off
the rail onto the ground,

60
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:10,572
my wife's laughin' so hard,
she nearly peed herself.

61
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,892
I learned two important things
that day about a trampoline.

62
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:16,060
Number one,

63
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:18,597
the springs will pull the hair
out of your legs.

64
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,666
(LAUGHS)

65
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:24,669
And number two,
the dog doesn't like to jump.

66
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,673
It's a wonder I'm alive.

67
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:30,419
I'm always doin'
idiotic stuff like that.

68
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:32,288
Anybody ever set
your hair on fire?

69
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:33,478
(AUDIENCE CHEERS)

70
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,113
Me, too!

71
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:36,881
And not the hair on my head.

72
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:41,953
All right, shall we not go
to the gutter so quick?

73
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:44,655
It was the hair on my arms.

74
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,836
Now, I want you to think back
to when you were a kid.

75
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,404
Do you remember
the day you realized

76
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,406
you could burn ants
with a magnifying glass?

77
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,998
Oh, what a great day that was.

78
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,767
You got to be God.

79
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:59,004
You decided who lived, who died.

80
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:02,941
I must have burned ants
for an hour, just laughin'.

81
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,009
Then I saw one on my arm.

82
00:04:08,232 --> 00:04:09,631
Let me tell you somethin',

83
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:11,866
you burn yourself
with a magnifying glass,

84
00:04:11,935 --> 00:04:14,202
you're on your own.

85
00:04:14,271 --> 00:04:15,737
You can't even tell your mom,

86
00:04:15,806 --> 00:04:19,658
'cause they give you that look
like, "Oh, he is that stupid."

87
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:24,112
Remember chin-up bars
in elementary school?

88
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:27,182
Yeah. So do I.

89
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,029
Fourth grade, me and my buddy
got this idea,

90
00:04:29,053 --> 00:04:31,131
we would ride our Sting-Ray
bikes through the chin-up bar.

91
00:04:31,155 --> 00:04:33,299
When we got to
the chin-up bar,
we would grab the bar,

92
00:04:33,323 --> 00:04:36,224
let our bike go
and then just swing there.

93
00:04:36,292 --> 00:04:38,359
'Cause we're idiots.

94
00:04:38,428 --> 00:04:39,872
One day we were
on the playground.

95
00:04:39,896 --> 00:04:40,962
It had been rainin'.

96
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:44,032
We didn't think metal got
slick when it got wet.

97
00:04:44,101 --> 00:04:46,351
Never had cause
to think that thought.

98
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,460
We're straddling our bikes,
trying to look cool,

99
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:49,732
and I look over at the swings,

100
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,468
I see these two
little fifth-grade girls.

101
00:04:51,492 --> 00:04:54,493
I looked at my buddy, I said,
"Hey, man. Older women.

102
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,795
"I'll go first."

103
00:04:57,864 --> 00:05:00,031
Boy, I spun that
knobby tire in the mud.

104
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,811
I'm flying towards
that chin-up bar.

105
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:03,502
The banana seat's getting hot

106
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,620
just from
the wind blowin' by it.

107
00:05:05,689 --> 00:05:07,905
I hit that bar, I grabbed it,
let my bike go,

108
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:10,041
and my full weight
hit my hands on that wet pole.

109
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,910
(IMITATES FALLING SOUND)
I went...

110
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:14,212
Knocked out cold on the ground.

111
00:05:14,264 --> 00:05:15,480
My friend flips out.

112
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:17,493
He goes running across
the street to my house

113
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,295
where my mom's in bed
sick with the flu,

114
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,520
runs into her bedroom
and screams, "Bill's dead!"

115
00:05:25,642 --> 00:05:27,175
About the time I came to,

116
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,694
I saw a woman
in a nightgown and panties
run at me, going...

117
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:31,779
(SCREAMING)

118
00:05:31,848 --> 00:05:34,032
Boy, I wish I had have died.

119
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:36,267
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

120
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,053
That's what my wife
puts up with every day.

121
00:05:39,122 --> 00:05:40,422
Thank God she puts up with me.

122
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,857
I think my wife puts up
with me, though, 'cause I try.

123
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:45,493
And I think that's all any guy
can do, just try.

124
00:05:45,562 --> 00:05:47,061
That's right.

125
00:05:50,384 --> 00:05:53,351
'Cause we ain't
never gonna get it.

126
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,054
'Cause as soon as we get
close, you ladies change it.

127
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:58,356
It's like this memo goes out,

128
00:05:58,425 --> 00:05:59,835
"They're getting close,
change it,

129
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,579
"change it,
change it, change it."

130
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,263
But I try. Like when I'm home,
I try to get up

131
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:07,265
in the morning,
make breakfast for my family.

132
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,578
I make good American breakfast.

133
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:10,568
Eggs, bacon,
sausage, toast, coffee.

134
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:11,703
Here's the problem.

135
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:13,549
No matter what eggs
I start out to make,

136
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:14,972
they always end up scrambled.

137
00:06:15,925 --> 00:06:17,792
God, I can't work that yolk.

138
00:06:17,861 --> 00:06:19,794
I even bought
that stupid spatula off TV.

139
00:06:19,863 --> 00:06:21,491
You know,
the one with the forks?

140
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:22,847
Yeah, and the announcer goes,

141
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,076
"Even a moron can
flip an egg now."

142
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,419
Apparently not.

143
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,039
Can't have sausage anymore.

144
00:06:31,108 --> 00:06:32,485
Not 'cause of
any health reasons,

145
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:34,810
just 'cause I saw a commercial
that scared me to death.

146
00:06:34,878 --> 00:06:36,956
I'm watching TV one night,
this commercial comes on.

147
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,064
This is what the announcer
said, word for word.

148
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:40,892
"The eggs are
from real chickens.

149
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:42,951
"The milk is from real cows.

150
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:45,453
"The sausage is
from Jimmy Dean."

151
00:06:55,432 --> 00:06:57,565
Really?

152
00:06:57,634 --> 00:07:00,568
You'd think somebody
would have caught that.

153
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:04,505
But I know my wife loves me.

154
00:07:04,574 --> 00:07:06,820
Not too long ago, I had to
get out of bed, got dressed.

155
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:09,789
She goes, "Where you going?"
I said, "Oh, I got
my yearly physical today."

156
00:07:09,813 --> 00:07:11,224
She goes,
"Oh, I'll go with you."

157
00:07:11,248 --> 00:07:14,466
It's like, "Okay.
How boring is your day?"

158
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:18,369
I wouldn't go with her
to her physical. God!

159
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,904
Seen it.

160
00:07:21,591 --> 00:07:23,191
(AUDIENCE CLAPPING)

161
00:07:25,428 --> 00:07:28,579
Yeah, it's not like
we're gonna break
any new ground there.

162
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:34,669
It's not like I'm gonna go,
"Wow, Doc, what is that?"

163
00:07:34,738 --> 00:07:36,070
But she was in the room

164
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:38,839
when the doctor told me
my cholesterol's gettin' high.

165
00:07:38,908 --> 00:07:40,575
I'm like, "Good goin', Doc."

166
00:07:40,643 --> 00:07:41,843
Hell, it would've been easier

167
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:43,973
if he just told her
I was cheatin' on her.

168
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:45,824
Yeah, if he tells her
I'm cheatin' on her,

169
00:07:45,848 --> 00:07:47,393
I just got to take some garbage.

170
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:50,485
Now I got to eat a bunch of it.

171
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:52,420
He told me to cut out bacon,
which sucks,

172
00:07:52,489 --> 00:07:53,955
'cause I love pig.

173
00:07:54,023 --> 00:07:55,501
So my wife,
trying to be helpful,

174
00:07:55,525 --> 00:07:57,470
goes to the grocery store
and buys this stuff

175
00:07:57,494 --> 00:07:58,960
called soy bacon.

176
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,530
Yeah.
Let me tell you somethin'.

177
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:05,450
I know soybeans are good
for a lot of things.

178
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:08,553
Let's stay out of
the bacon market!

179
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:10,583
They go, "Looks and tastes
like real bacon."

180
00:08:10,607 --> 00:08:12,691
No, it doesn't!

181
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,671
Tastes like somebody
bacon-flavored a turd,

182
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:16,211
that's what it tastes like.

183
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:22,661
She's all worried
about my stress.

184
00:08:22,685 --> 00:08:24,280
She goes,
"You got too much stress."

185
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:25,682
I go,
"I don't have any stress."

186
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:28,172
She goes, "Bill, you almost
got kicked off an airplane."

187
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:29,290
Good point.

188
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:30,708
Well, here's what happened.

189
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:32,822
I got on this airline,
it was a early morning flight.

190
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,445
And they board us
and I sit in my seat

191
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,780
and I pull out my Game Boy

192
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,593
and start playin' it,
while they're still boarding.

193
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:40,701
Yeah, I know.
God forbid I read
a newspaper or <i>Time</i> magazine.

194
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,521
I got to get
Scooter to level nine.

195
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,951
But I'm minding my own business,

196
00:08:44,975 --> 00:08:46,141
playing my Game Boy.

197
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:47,920
The pilot comes on
and makes this announcement.

198
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,456
He goes, "Ladies and
gentlemen, we're gonna be
a little delayed this morning.

199
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,848
"They didn't put enough gas
in the plane."

200
00:08:53,917 --> 00:08:56,484
Why would you
make that announcement?

201
00:08:57,487 --> 00:08:59,387
Make somethin' up!

202
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,956
Tell me you ate a piece of
bad fish and you got the runs.

203
00:09:02,025 --> 00:09:03,792
Tell me somethin'.

204
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,377
Don't tell me we don't got
enough gas in the plane.

205
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:08,341
That's like number two
on the checklist for,

206
00:09:08,365 --> 00:09:10,381
"It's okay to take off."

207
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:12,983
Keys, gas.

208
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:18,668
'Cause, see,
the way the process works
in my little brain

209
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:20,603
is the gas truck
pulls up next to the plane,

210
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:24,462
the pilot sticks
his head out the window,
and goes, "Fill her up."

211
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:26,051
Yeah. I get
the one pilot in America,

212
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:27,882
"We're going to Vegas,
give me five bucks.

213
00:09:27,951 --> 00:09:29,301
"We'll be all right."

214
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,298
So I know we're
going to be delayed.

215
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:33,521
Nothing I can do about it.

216
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:34,867
So I keep playing my Game Boy.

217
00:09:34,891 --> 00:09:36,252
Flight attendant walks by me,

218
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:37,408
and, y'all,

219
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:40,211
I might as well have been
building a plutonium bomb.

220
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,662
She flips.

221
00:09:41,731 --> 00:09:43,197
She goes, "Sir! Sir!

222
00:09:43,266 --> 00:09:45,547
"You need to shut
that off right now!"

223
00:09:46,202 --> 00:09:48,053
I'm 48 years old.

224
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:49,754
All of a sudden now I'm six.

225
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:52,990
(STAMMERING)

226
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:55,471
(IN CHILD'S VOICE)
"But if I shut it off,
then Scooter'll die

227
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:57,629
"and I'll have to
go back to level one!"

228
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,970
And then she said it.

229
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:08,806
She goes, "Sir, do you know
where the on/off switch is?"

230
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:12,693
(AUDIENCE EXCLAIMING)

231
00:10:12,762 --> 00:10:14,546
(LAUGHS)

232
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,647
I said, "Ma'am,

233
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,416
"when I got up this mornin',

234
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:20,918
"I didn't want to be a jackass.

235
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:23,254
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

236
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,692
"You just pushed
my jackass button."

237
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:37,685
So I said, "Yeah, I know
where the on/off switch is.

238
00:10:37,754 --> 00:10:40,288
"Do you know
where the gas cap is?"

239
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:43,892
And, you know,
a body cavity search

240
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,227
isn't that bad
if you just relax.

241
00:10:48,365 --> 00:10:50,809
My wife's all worried,
she goes,
"You're gonna have a stroke,

242
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,912
"you got so much stress."
I go, "I'm not
gonna have a stroke."

243
00:10:52,936 --> 00:10:54,180
She goes,
"You need a massage."

244
00:10:54,204 --> 00:10:56,988
And I go, "No. Uh-uh.
I don't want a massage."

245
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:59,424
And she goes, "Why not?"
And I go, "It's weird.

246
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:01,826
"Somebody you don't know
rubbin' on you."

247
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:05,313
Hell, that's how
I ended up married.

248
00:11:05,382 --> 00:11:07,782
I mean, it worked out,
don't get me wrong.

249
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,128
She goes,
"Well, you need one."

250
00:11:09,152 --> 00:11:10,696
I go, "Well,
I don't want one, baby."

251
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,164
She goes, "Well, I already
set you up one."

252
00:11:12,188 --> 00:11:15,223
I'm like, "Why do we even
have these conversations?"

253
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,875
So she takes me to this spa

254
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:19,077
and they put me in this room
and it was weird.

255
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:20,979
There's like
pillows all over the floor

256
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:23,414
and this weird
Zamfir music playin'.

257
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:25,523
And they got water
dribblin' over rocks,

258
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:27,051
that's supposed to relax you.

259
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,070
Just made me have to go pee.

260
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:31,539
I finally got
enough nerve to walk

261
00:11:31,574 --> 00:11:32,934
out of there
and the door opened.

262
00:11:32,975 --> 00:11:35,042
This little 25-year-old
blonde girl opens the door

263
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,656
and she goes,
"Are you Mr. Engvall?"

264
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,480
And I went, "No... Yeah."

265
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,160
She goes,
"I'm your masseuse."

266
00:11:41,184 --> 00:11:43,501
(LAUGHING)
And I go...

267
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:46,470
Oh, this ain't gonna be good.

268
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:49,651
I said, "Don't you
got some big fat guy

269
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:51,687
"with a hairy back
to do this?"

270
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:55,079
She goes, "You'll be fine."
I go, "I don't think so."

271
00:11:56,699 --> 00:11:59,545
So she goes, "Okay,
go ahead and get undressed
and get on the bed."

272
00:11:59,569 --> 00:12:01,180
And I go, "You mean
just down to my underwear?"

273
00:12:01,204 --> 00:12:02,748
And she goes,
"No, you need to be naked."

274
00:12:02,772 --> 00:12:05,090
I went, "God,

275
00:12:07,677 --> 00:12:10,378
"I know you're testin' me here.

276
00:12:10,446 --> 00:12:14,431
"And you need to know,
I'm just a C student. Okay?"

277
00:12:23,192 --> 00:12:24,937
So she's holding up the sheet
and she goes,

278
00:12:24,961 --> 00:12:29,130
"Okay, lay on your stomach."
And I went, "Oh, thank God."

279
00:12:29,198 --> 00:12:31,599
She starts rubbing my back,
which felt great.

280
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,351
And then she goes, "So what do
you like to have done to you?"

281
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,638
And I went,
"Okay, God, that's enough!"

282
00:12:37,707 --> 00:12:40,208
Then she starts rubbin' my butt.

283
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,076
Yeah.

284
00:12:42,144 --> 00:12:44,712
And all I could think about
is, "Don't fart."

285
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,514
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

286
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:49,834
Yeah, you've thought
about it, haven't you?

287
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:53,171
Yeah! 'Cause when you're
standing up and you got gas,

288
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,473
you can kind of clench it in.

289
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:57,619
But when somebody's

290
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:59,723
rubbing your butt
cheeks east and west,

291
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,914
yeah, you know
one of those icky dog farts

292
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:05,566
is gonna sneak out.

293
00:13:07,504 --> 00:13:09,787
So then she goes, "Okay,
roll over on your back."

294
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:12,123
And I'm like,
"Here it comes."

295
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:14,892
And I'm thinking of anything.

296
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:18,295
I'm thinking of
Grandma in her panties,

297
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:21,833
my dad scratching himself
with a salad fork, you know.

298
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:25,769
So I roll over,
everything's fine.

299
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,482
Until she takes
her hand in the sheet

300
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:29,173
and starts going like this.

301
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:31,508
I'm like, "Hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

302
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:32,776
"What are you doin'?"

303
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:34,326
She goes,
"I'm gonna rub your legs."

304
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,930
I go, "They're fine."

305
00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:37,460
She goes,
"They seem kind of hard."

306
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,684
And I go, "You have no idea."

307
00:13:46,008 --> 00:13:47,720
So then she comes
around the top of me

308
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,943
and starts rubbing my chest,
which was great,

309
00:13:50,012 --> 00:13:53,164
except that
her boobs are like...

310
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:54,877
She's like,
"So you're a comedian."

311
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:56,768
I go, "No, bobblehead doll."

312
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,266
I walk outside, my wife's
like, "How was it?"

313
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:03,791
And I go, "Awful!
I'm more stressed now

314
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,877
"than I was
when I went in there."

315
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:09,764
See, I relieve
my stress by buyin' stuff.

316
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,944
I go to Cabela's
or Bass Pro Shops.

317
00:14:11,968 --> 00:14:13,117
Yeah.

318
00:14:14,236 --> 00:14:16,003
(MAN WHISTLING)

319
00:14:16,072 --> 00:14:17,288
Here's the problem.

320
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,522
I'm an impulse buyer.

321
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,435
I'll like, "Oh, look,
I bought a deer feeder."

322
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,459
Then I think, "Oh, man,
I got to get it home."

323
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,295
And that drives my wife crazy.

324
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,130
'Cause she's
very much a list shopper.

325
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,099
Like, she hates it
when I get on airplanes.

326
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,301
Because the airlines
now have this magazine

327
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,337
called <i>SkyMall</i> magazine.

328
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:33,938
(EXCLAIMS)

329
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:35,656
That is my crack.

330
00:14:37,093 --> 00:14:39,093
I know it's just crap.

331
00:14:39,162 --> 00:14:41,145
But it's crap I gotta have.

332
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:44,732
I bought
a escalator for my house.

333
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,937
Just 'cause it conveniently
fits underneath the bed.

334
00:14:50,006 --> 00:14:53,102
That's how they get you.
You ever been flipping
through that magazine,

335
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:54,337
not paying a bit of attention?

336
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:56,321
And all of a sudden
this will catch your eye.

337
00:14:56,345 --> 00:14:58,529
"Tired of your knees touching
when you sleep?"

338
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:02,433
Well, now that you mention it,
yes, I am.

339
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:04,280
And they sell
some stupid stuff in there.

340
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:06,482
Have you seen
that rubber thing
you put on your shoes?

341
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:09,423
And it says, "You can aerate
your own lawn."

342
00:15:11,561 --> 00:15:15,863
Okay. How big a loser are you?

343
00:15:15,932 --> 00:15:18,883
Stomping around your yard,
"I'm savin' money."

344
00:15:25,942 --> 00:15:28,142
Don't get me wrong, it works.

345
00:15:31,648 --> 00:15:32,847
She got really mad at me

346
00:15:32,915 --> 00:15:34,410
when I bought
a digital fly swatter

347
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,083
out of that magazine.

348
00:15:36,152 --> 00:15:39,938
Well, come on, it keeps track
of swats, hits, and kills.

349
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:42,206
And the best part is, you
could hook it to the Internet,

350
00:15:42,242 --> 00:15:43,474
and you could see

351
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:45,543
where you rank
nationally as a fly swatter.

352
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:49,458
I did see one item
in that magazine

353
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:50,681
that made me laugh out loud.

354
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,317
It's "House shoes
with headlights."

355
00:15:54,637 --> 00:15:56,503
I couldn't believe it, either.

356
00:15:56,572 --> 00:15:58,405
House shoes with headlights.

357
00:15:58,474 --> 00:16:00,319
My first thought was,
"Who buys these?"

358
00:16:00,343 --> 00:16:02,423
Then the other night I was
walking to the bathroom,

359
00:16:02,478 --> 00:16:03,761
I stubbed my toe on the bed.

360
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,529
You know what I got now?

361
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:08,065
House shoes with headlights,
baby!

362
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,035
They are awesome!

363
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:14,216
The other night
I took the trash out,

364
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,841
my high beams hit a deer,
he just stood there.

365
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:22,624
Sometimes I like
to beat my wife to bed

366
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,793
and I'll just lay naked
on the bed in the dark room

367
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,452
except for my house shoes
with headlights on.

368
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,438
So it's like a movie premiere.
It's like,

369
00:16:30,506 --> 00:16:32,824
"Hey, hey, hey.

370
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:36,527
"Coming to a theater near you.

371
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,681
<i>"King Kong."</i>

372
00:16:41,718 --> 00:16:43,378
She goes,
"Put on your underwear,

373
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:44,769
"it's more like <i>Smallville."</i>

374
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,503
Yeah, she gets on me
about my shopping,

375
00:16:50,527 --> 00:16:52,226
yet she ordered us a catalog

376
00:16:52,295 --> 00:16:54,262
that's just stuff for our dogs.

377
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:56,297
Forty-two pages of dog stuff.

378
00:16:56,366 --> 00:16:57,876
She bought a dog feeding dish

379
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,210
that's this high off the ground.

380
00:16:59,234 --> 00:17:00,563
I said,
"Why did you buy that?"

381
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:03,988
She goes, "So he don't have to
bend his neck to eat."

382
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:07,759
"I just saw him
lickin' his own ass.

383
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:15,432
"Excuse me for thinking
he's limber enough to eat."

384
00:17:17,754 --> 00:17:19,498
She goes, "Well, it helps
with his digestion."

385
00:17:19,522 --> 00:17:21,989
I go,
"His digestion's just fine.

386
00:17:22,057 --> 00:17:25,092
"I pick it out of the backyard
every morning."

387
00:17:26,095 --> 00:17:27,561
God, she loves them dogs, boy.

388
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,710
I love them, too, but they're
just dogs, all right.

389
00:17:29,765 --> 00:17:31,843
We had to take our dogs
to be boarded recently.

390
00:17:31,867 --> 00:17:33,512
I don't know if
you've had to do this,

391
00:17:33,536 --> 00:17:35,336
but it's like
checking them into a spa.

392
00:17:35,404 --> 00:17:38,139
I walk our dogs in,
the little girl
behind the counter goes, "Hi.

393
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,274
"Just a few questions.

394
00:17:40,343 --> 00:17:43,644
"What do your dogs like
to sleep on, linen or wool?"

395
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,599
"Concrete's good."

396
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:53,771
"Well, what kind of
water do they like?"

397
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,106
"Clear.

398
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,809
"Put it in a toilet,
they'll freak."

399
00:18:00,729 --> 00:18:03,030
And then she
actually asked me this.

400
00:18:03,099 --> 00:18:04,877
She goes, "Would you like to
purchase a toothbrush

401
00:18:04,901 --> 00:18:07,100
"for your dogs
for the weekend?"

402
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,838
"Tell you what,

403
00:18:10,907 --> 00:18:13,340
"you teach him to hold it,
I'll buy the toothbrush."

404
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,329
See, we got four dogs.

405
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:20,531
We got two wiener dogs,
those are her dogs.

406
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,745
Yeah, they're cute till they
have to go to the vet.

407
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,635
Then it's like
a billion dollars.

408
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:26,298
I took our two wiener dogs
to our vet.

409
00:18:26,322 --> 00:18:28,633
Our idiot vet goes,
"That dog's gonna have
back problems."

410
00:18:28,657 --> 00:18:30,591
I'm like, "Well, no kiddin'.

411
00:18:30,659 --> 00:18:32,404
"He's got a eight-foot back
and two-inch legs.

412
00:18:32,428 --> 00:18:35,079
"Hell, I could
have figured that out.

413
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,684
"Here's another one,
Doc Obvious.

414
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:42,753
"That's a boy dog
and he's about a quarter inch

415
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:45,623
"from dragging his
transmission on the sidewalk."

416
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:52,646
He goes, "Well,
you need to talk to that dog

417
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:55,933
"and tell it not to jump
off the bed." I was like,

418
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,103
"All right.

419
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:00,737
"Soon as we get home,
me and that dog

420
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:03,090
"gonna have
a little sit-down."

421
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:05,376
Then we got my dog, Duke,
he's a basset hound.

422
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:07,678
He's the perfect dog. Yeah!

423
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:09,447
He eats his own turds.

424
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:11,198
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

425
00:19:11,267 --> 00:19:13,684
Perfect dog, right there.

426
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:16,287
Goes outside to poop,
cleans it up.

427
00:19:18,007 --> 00:19:19,857
You can't teach that.

428
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,510
That's just a gift.

429
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:27,348
Best part about it, my wife
doesn't know he does it.

430
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,534
She loves to let that dog
lick her in the face.

431
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,987
Right there,
that's why my wife and I

432
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,610
have never had an argument.

433
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,525
She starts getting on my back
and all I say is,

434
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:44,865
"Duke,
Mama wants some lovin'."

435
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,197
I took Duke
to the vet and told the vet

436
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:50,421
that Duke eats his own turds.

437
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,023
I said,
"Isn't that kind of weird?"

438
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:53,768
And he goes,
"No, a lot of dogs do it."

439
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,871
He said, "Here, just sprinkle
this stuff on his food

440
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:58,007
"and it'll make him stop."
And I said, "What's it do?"

441
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:00,998
And he goes, "It makes
his turds taste bad."

442
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,345
"I'm sorry, Doc.
I'm a little slow here.

443
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:15,946
"Did you just say the phrase,

444
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:19,116
"'It'll make his turds
taste bad'?"

445
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:22,519
Hey, if you've sunk
to eating turds,

446
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:24,054
you've never uttered the phrase,

447
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:25,656
"Oh, my God, this is nasty."

448
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:29,593
And we got a German shepherd

449
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:31,740
we found on the side
of the road. She's psycho.

450
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:33,942
Now I know why she was
on the side of the road.

451
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:35,999
Yeah. Nothing's free.

452
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:38,402
But I love that dog.

453
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:40,215
That dog saved
my heinie one night.

454
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,384
One night my wife and I
were sound asleep in bed,

455
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,185
her dog was trying to
jump up on the bed

456
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:45,509
after I just talked to it.

457
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:49,274
So I just grabbed
the little wiener dog

458
00:20:49,298 --> 00:20:50,942
and flung him out
in the backyard.

459
00:20:50,966 --> 00:20:52,566
Well,
about 5:30 that morning,

460
00:20:52,635 --> 00:20:54,946
I heard this
squealin' and screamin'
coming out of the backyard.

461
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,970
Good God, I hopped
out of bed in my underwear,

462
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,772
put on my headlight house shoes,

463
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,107
ran out in the backyard,

464
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:02,109
and a coyote
had jumped the fence.

465
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:05,012
Yes,
and had my wife's wiener dog
pinned down on the ground.

466
00:21:05,081 --> 00:21:07,415
I'm like, "Oh, hell.

467
00:21:08,818 --> 00:21:11,202
"I appreciate what you're doin'.

468
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:14,015
"Could have done it
a little quieter,

469
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,757
"couldn't you?"

470
00:21:16,825 --> 00:21:19,060
About that time,
I felt this whoosh by my leg.

471
00:21:19,128 --> 00:21:21,173
That German shepherd
ran out in that backyard,

472
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:22,430
hit that coyote broadside.

473
00:21:22,498 --> 00:21:24,831
That coyote did three flips
and jumped the fence.

474
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,278
I looked
at that German shepherd,

475
00:21:26,302 --> 00:21:29,536
I said, "Come on,
you're sleepin' in the bed."

476
00:21:29,605 --> 00:21:31,734
Funny thing was, for about
two weeks after that,

477
00:21:31,758 --> 00:21:33,935
my wife and I'd be sitting
at the breakfast table
having coffee.

478
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,079
We'd look out in the street

479
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,639
and there'd be
two or three coyotes

480
00:21:36,663 --> 00:21:38,474
sitting in our street,
lookin' in our backyard.

481
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:41,715
And you know the conversation
went like this,

482
00:21:41,784 --> 00:21:44,101
"What? No, hell no.

483
00:21:45,104 --> 00:21:46,937
"Don't go in there.

484
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:48,806
"That little dog's a setup.

485
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:54,345
"I ain't lying.

486
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:56,614
"Ask Joe what happened to him.

487
00:21:56,683 --> 00:21:59,617
"Hell, he won't eat
nothing but soy bacon now."

488
00:21:59,686 --> 00:22:02,469
God bless you, Washington,
I appreciate it!

took a tour bus into town,

to Washington DC before.

00:23:24,754 --> 00:23:27,688
"and now it's
a Cracker Barrel, so welcome."

509
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:32,326
I almost got ran over today

510
00:23:32,395 --> 00:23:35,695
by a mobile
paper-shredding unit.

511
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,050
I'm in Georgetown.
They got them on every street,

512
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:44,088
these gigantic evidence
getter-ridder-of-ers.

513
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:47,157
Can you call them up

514
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:49,426
if you got a body
you don't need around?

515
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:55,933
My wife had been in Europe
for three weeks,

516
00:23:56,002 --> 00:23:58,869
and she left two days
after Valentine's day.

517
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,237
And for Valentine's Day,

518
00:24:00,306 --> 00:24:02,417
I was going to take her
to see <i>Brokeback Mountain,</i>

519
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:03,640
and, uh,

520
00:24:04,427 --> 00:24:05,547
it was sold out,

521
00:24:05,578 --> 00:24:07,155
so we're going to
go see it tomorrow.

522
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:09,291
And Heath Ledger
and Jake Gyllenhaal

523
00:24:09,315 --> 00:24:10,681
are both amazing actors.

524
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,849
And if you've seen the movie,
don't ruin it for me.

525
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:15,986
I don't want to know
which one plays the sheep.

526
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:24,089
In fact, I'm actually
writing a movie right now

527
00:24:24,113 --> 00:24:27,248
about my recent bout
with erectile dysfunction,

528
00:24:28,117 --> 00:24:30,234
called <i>Broke Dick Fountain.</i>

529
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:40,272
Getting ready to
film this movie,

530
00:24:40,296 --> 00:24:42,329
everybody's like,
"You gotta go on a diet, man.

531
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:44,509
"You gotta lose some weight.
You got to be better.

532
00:24:44,533 --> 00:24:46,595
"You gotta be thinner.
You gotta look better."

533
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:48,539
And I'm like, "Look better?
I'm 50 years old,

534
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:50,747
"I've been drinking
like a fish for 30 years.

535
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,522
"What do you want?"

536
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:56,827
Been on this diet, man.

537
00:24:56,896 --> 00:24:59,830
I'm getting dieting tips
from skinny people.

538
00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:02,967
My mother weighs 80 pounds.

539
00:25:03,035 --> 00:25:04,401
Here's her tip.

540
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,937
"Drink a lot of water.

541
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:09,389
"You'll be less hungry."

542
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:12,042
You know what happens
if you drink a lot of water?

543
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,210
You're less thirsty.

544
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:15,846
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

545
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:23,103
Just as I suspected
would be the case.

546
00:25:26,642 --> 00:25:28,041
I still look okay sometimes,

547
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,705
'cause I wear
really expensive suits,

548
00:25:29,729 --> 00:25:31,878
and if you drape
$5,000 worth of clothes

549
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,214
over a pile of crap,
it looks all right.

550
00:25:35,751 --> 00:25:37,634
Look bad naked though.

551
00:25:39,939 --> 00:25:42,272
Ain't no hiding that, is there?

552
00:25:43,342 --> 00:25:44,519
The only person that knows

553
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,987
what I look like naked
right now,

554
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:48,156
which is the worst I've
ever looked, is my wife.

555
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,563
And she has to have sex with me.

556
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,632
And she makes me wear the suit.

557
00:25:56,689 --> 00:25:59,006
I cut a little hole right here.

558
00:26:00,042 --> 00:26:02,309
I come in low under the radar.

559
00:26:09,051 --> 00:26:10,984
Washington DC, uh...

560
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,910
I guess the Department
of Homeland Security

561
00:26:12,939 --> 00:26:14,872
is here in Washington, DC,
is that true?

562
00:26:14,941 --> 00:26:18,642
Uh, one of the most useless
organizations on the planet.

563
00:26:18,711 --> 00:26:21,077
They came up with a...

564
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:24,130
Now, I really didn't even have
an opinion about that

565
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,865
and, uh,
and I don't care if you do.

566
00:26:25,934 --> 00:26:28,402
But my mother called me
one time, and she was scared

567
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:30,232
because the heightened
state of awareness

568
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:31,855
went from yellow to orange,

569
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,258
and she said, "Son, I
don't know what to do."

570
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:38,963
And I'm like, "Mama, nobody
knows what to do."

571
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:41,615
Does anybody in this room
know what to do different

572
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,328
when the heightened
state of awareness

573
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:44,496
goes from yellow to orange?

574
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,569
No, you do not.

575
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:48,939
Because it is useless.

576
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:51,842
It means nothing!

577
00:26:51,911 --> 00:26:54,377
Nobody knows
what to do different

578
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:57,180
if it changes from
one to the other.

579
00:26:57,249 --> 00:26:58,409
Yeah, now I get it,

580
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,095
that's a heightened
state of awareness.

581
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:02,363
If I'm on... In line
to get on a plane,

582
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:03,654
and the guy in front of me

583
00:27:03,723 --> 00:27:06,001
needs two loads of phlegm
to pronounce his name,

584
00:27:06,025 --> 00:27:08,409
I'm checking
his shoes for fuses.

585
00:27:09,745 --> 00:27:12,062
And I don't care
who knows it, either.

586
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,131
I'm...

587
00:27:15,183 --> 00:27:18,218
And it's not being racist,
it's profiling.

588
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:30,481
I... I... I went on
the computer and I found out

589
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:32,966
there are five heightened
states of awareness.

590
00:27:33,035 --> 00:27:34,830
I'd only heard two,
yellow and orange.

591
00:27:34,854 --> 00:27:36,654
Turns out there's five.

592
00:27:36,722 --> 00:27:39,823
Uh, blue, green,
yellow, orange, red.

593
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:41,075
Apparently,

594
00:27:41,143 --> 00:27:43,577
when the heightened state
of awareness is blue,

595
00:27:43,645 --> 00:27:45,929
you don't even need sunscreen.

596
00:27:47,283 --> 00:27:49,199
You could walk outside naked.

597
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:56,518
My wife said,
"Well, why don't you

598
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:58,975
"come up with
a better system?"

599
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:01,461
"All right,
give me 10 minutes."

600
00:28:02,898 --> 00:28:06,099
Here's
the Ron White Heightened State
of Awareness System.

601
00:28:06,168 --> 00:28:09,103
It's only got two heightened
states of awareness.

602
00:28:09,171 --> 00:28:10,888
"Go find a helmet."

603
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,257
"Put on the damn helmet."

604
00:28:21,984 --> 00:28:25,251
That way I can answer
my mother's questions.

605
00:28:26,555 --> 00:28:29,222
"Ron, it's
Put on a Damn Helmet Day,

606
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:30,291
"what do we do?"

607
00:28:31,677 --> 00:28:34,110
"Put on the damn helmet,
Mother."

608
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:37,748
"Thank you, Son,
we're so proud."

609
00:28:45,173 --> 00:28:47,407
My wife usually travels with
me and we kind of hop

610
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,454
from Indian reservation
to Indian reservation

611
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,411
doing these casinos,

612
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,314
and last fall, we were doing
a run across Florida,

613
00:28:54,383 --> 00:28:56,466
and this is how
well my mother hears

614
00:28:56,535 --> 00:28:58,068
at 70 years old.

615
00:28:58,137 --> 00:29:01,604
She calls me. She asks... asks
me where I'm at

616
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:03,673
and, uh, we're at the, uh,
Hard Rock Casino

617
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,475
in Hollywood, Florida,

618
00:29:05,544 --> 00:29:07,161
on the Seminole reservation.

619
00:29:07,229 --> 00:29:09,046
And she asks me where I'm at.
I hear my dad

620
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:10,741
in the background go,
"What'd he say?"

621
00:29:10,765 --> 00:29:12,043
And she goes,
"He said in Hollywood,

622
00:29:12,067 --> 00:29:15,168
"you need reservations
to get a cinnamon roll."

623
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:21,958
That's close enough, Mom.

624
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:26,696
I lost my ass at that casino.

625
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,231
Usually I do okay gambling

626
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,533
'cause I'm just a straight
blackjack player.

627
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,302
Right, but I started watching

628
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:35,005
these Texas
Hold'em tournaments on TV.

629
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:37,073
And the only thing
that's dangerous about that

630
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:39,209
is, after a while,
you start to think

631
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:42,095
you can play that game for real.

632
00:29:42,164 --> 00:29:44,392
But you sit down in one of
those big poker rooms,

633
00:29:44,416 --> 00:29:46,316
you find out really quick

634
00:29:46,385 --> 00:29:49,686
that they don't let you see
everybody else's cards.

635
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:55,103
I'm sitting there going,

636
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:58,061
"How am I supposed to know
how much to bet?"

637
00:29:58,913 --> 00:30:00,642
"Where's that little odds thing

638
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:02,999
"that tells me how I'm doing?

639
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:08,138
"I got a question."

640
00:30:12,928 --> 00:30:16,129
Our second stop on that tour
was Fort Myers, Florida.

641
00:30:16,198 --> 00:30:17,598
And my wife and I wanted to go

642
00:30:17,666 --> 00:30:19,511
to Sanibel and
Captiva Islands, uh,

643
00:30:19,535 --> 00:30:21,012
which is
basically Margaritaville.

644
00:30:21,036 --> 00:30:22,614
You know,
that's where Jimmy Buffett

645
00:30:22,638 --> 00:30:23,958
lived when he wrote those songs,

646
00:30:24,005 --> 00:30:25,972
and very pretty,
very romantic place.

647
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:27,908
And the only way
to get to Sanibel Island

648
00:30:27,976 --> 00:30:29,509
is to cross
a little rickety bridge.

649
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:30,777
I mean, a bridge...

650
00:30:30,846 --> 00:30:32,926
I've never seen such
a rickety bridge in my life.

651
00:30:32,981 --> 00:30:34,614
Just a rickety bridge.

652
00:30:34,683 --> 00:30:38,351
And the toll to cross this
little rickety bridge is $6,

653
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,298
to cross a little
rickety freaking bridge.

654
00:30:40,322 --> 00:30:41,604
You know, and I...

655
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:44,941
I expected there to be
a troll and some billy goats.

656
00:30:47,146 --> 00:30:49,412
Six bucks to cross
a little bridge.

657
00:30:49,481 --> 00:30:51,882
And I... You know, and I make
a lot of money, folks.

658
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:54,785
Not doing this.
I sell shrimp out of a van.

659
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:00,224
And the bridge is
such a piece of crap

660
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:03,693
that the speed limit on it
is five miles an hour,

661
00:31:03,762 --> 00:31:05,529
and I got a ticket.

662
00:31:07,148 --> 00:31:09,649
This cop says, "You have any
idea how fast you were goin'?"

663
00:31:09,717 --> 00:31:11,396
I was like,
"I don't know, eight, nine.

664
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,819
"I don't know.

665
00:31:12,887 --> 00:31:15,539
"My foot slipped
off the brake, I..."

666
00:31:18,277 --> 00:31:21,093
"I clocked you
doing over 11 mile an hour.

667
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:24,781
"Over twice
the legal speed limit."

668
00:31:27,502 --> 00:31:30,903
"Take me to jail.
I'm beggin' you.

669
00:31:33,775 --> 00:31:36,193
"I'll make a million dollars
telling this story

670
00:31:36,262 --> 00:31:39,746
"if you'll take me to jail
for going 11 miles an hour."

671
00:31:46,372 --> 00:31:47,737
Then you get to the place

672
00:31:47,806 --> 00:31:50,001
where you pay your toll, folks.

673
00:31:50,025 --> 00:31:51,441
And there's a little sign.

674
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:53,788
You can go there, still there
today, there's a little sign,

675
00:31:53,812 --> 00:31:55,557
right before you
get to the tollbooth,

676
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:59,065
and it says,
"No coins or cash."

677
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:03,820
I'm like, "What do they want
you to give them,

678
00:32:03,889 --> 00:32:04,889
"a hand job?"

679
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:08,769
"I've never been
good with my left hand.

680
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:10,538
"Honey, if you just
sit in the back seat.

681
00:32:10,562 --> 00:32:13,963
"Sir, if you just
walk right around there,
sit down right there."

682
00:32:16,552 --> 00:32:17,632
We, uh...

683
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:19,686
Whenever we're in
that part of the, uh, country,

684
00:32:19,755 --> 00:32:21,755
we stay at the Don CeSar Hotel.

685
00:32:21,824 --> 00:32:23,024
And my wife and I travel

686
00:32:23,058 --> 00:32:24,602
on a big tour bus
with three dogs.

687
00:32:24,626 --> 00:32:26,638
We have, uh,
two Scottish terriers

688
00:32:26,662 --> 00:32:28,789
because if you drink enough
Johnnie Walker products,

689
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:31,548
eventually,
they just send you the dogs.

690
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:39,856
We have, uh, 240 head of Scottie

691
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:42,659
on a little ranch
up in Wyoming. It's a...

692
00:32:42,728 --> 00:32:45,545
We got these little monkeys
with cowboy hats and vests

693
00:32:45,614 --> 00:32:48,081
riding Shetland ponies.

694
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:50,383
They got little toy guns.

695
00:32:50,452 --> 00:32:52,285
One of them is the sheriff.

696
00:32:54,156 --> 00:32:56,223
Cutest thing you ever saw.

697
00:32:58,193 --> 00:33:00,560
Actually, uh,
we have two Scottish terriers

698
00:33:00,629 --> 00:33:02,506
and, uh, their names
are Birdie and Bogey.

699
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:03,875
And somebody the other day said,

700
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,111
"Oh, that's cute. They're
named after your golf game."

701
00:33:06,135 --> 00:33:08,413
And I was like, "No, if they
were named after my golf game

702
00:33:08,437 --> 00:33:09,581
"they'd be 'Double Bogey'

703
00:33:09,605 --> 00:33:11,516
"and 'Where the hell
is that ball going'?"

704
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:13,373
Which is...

705
00:33:13,442 --> 00:33:16,642
Which is kind of a long name
for a pet, you know?

706
00:33:17,946 --> 00:33:21,664
And then Sluggo,
he's my bulldog, and...

707
00:33:24,286 --> 00:33:26,286
It's apparently
talk-about-your-pet night

708
00:33:26,321 --> 00:33:27,787
here at the Warner.

709
00:33:27,856 --> 00:33:29,856
Uh, Sluggo was in the backyard
the other day,

710
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:31,575
and I was picking up, uh,
dog turds

711
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:34,677
'cause I couldn't get
Bill's dog to come over.

712
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:36,680
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

713
00:33:39,918 --> 00:33:42,469
"Come on,
let Duke spend the night."

714
00:33:44,872 --> 00:33:47,006
"No, he'll come home full."

715
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,461
So I'm picking up dog turds.
And while I'm picking them up,

716
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,280
I realize seven people
work for me full-time.

717
00:33:54,349 --> 00:33:56,211
And as I'm picking
up these dog turds,

718
00:33:56,235 --> 00:33:58,368
I'm reevaluating
everybody's position

719
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:00,486
with Ron White Inc.
In my head,

720
00:34:00,555 --> 00:34:04,241
so that next week I will not
be the dog turd picker-upper.

721
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:07,988
I haven't decided
who it's going to be yet.

722
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:09,490
It's either going to be
my pool boy

723
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:12,081
or my tax attorney.

724
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,917
And I'm leaning
towards the tax attorney.

725
00:34:22,176 --> 00:34:23,754
But I'm picking
up these dog turds,

726
00:34:23,778 --> 00:34:25,077
and I see one that is huge.

727
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,514
And it's massive
even by Sluggo's standards,

728
00:34:27,582 --> 00:34:29,182
which are legendary.

729
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:31,768
And I'm staring at this turd.
I'm admiring it, really.

730
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:35,349
And after a while,
I started to think

731
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:37,733
it says something
on the side of it.

732
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,022
I run in the house
and I get my glasses

733
00:34:41,046 --> 00:34:43,980
'cause I can't read shit
without my glasses.

734
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:52,422
And it does.

735
00:34:52,491 --> 00:34:56,493
It says,
"Midland Park Golf Course."

736
00:34:56,562 --> 00:35:00,397
Sluggo had eaten and shat whole

737
00:35:00,466 --> 00:35:05,001
a golf glove, Velcro and all.

738
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:10,724
I rinsed it off and I've been
using it for three weeks.

739
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,563
But my wife and I, we look for
pet-friendly hotels

740
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:20,299
when we're out, because we
travel with this menagerie.

741
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,102
And there is
no more pet-friendly hotel

742
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:23,870
on the planet
than the Don CeSar.

743
00:35:23,939 --> 00:35:26,990
They're, like,
over-the-top pet-friendly.

744
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:29,392
Uh, they have a pet concierge
that comes to your room

745
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:34,097
to tell you about the services
they offer your pets

746
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:36,182
while you stay at
the Don CeSar Hotel,

747
00:35:36,251 --> 00:35:38,218
and I sold a lot of shrimp
last year,

748
00:35:38,286 --> 00:35:41,788
so I'm like, "All right,
let's hear it.
What do you got?"

749
00:35:41,857 --> 00:35:43,857
And the guy goes,
"We offer your dogs a massage

750
00:35:43,925 --> 00:35:45,770
"because we would like
for your dogs to be

751
00:35:45,794 --> 00:35:46,893
"as relaxed as you are

752
00:35:46,962 --> 00:35:49,996
"during their stay
at the Don CeSar Hotel."

753
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:51,225
I'm like, "All right,

754
00:35:51,283 --> 00:35:52,877
"but I'm going to
tell you right now,

755
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:54,496
"that fat one right over there,

756
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,686
"he's gonna want
a happy ending."

757
00:36:02,561 --> 00:36:05,328
They have
aromatherapy for your pets.

758
00:36:05,397 --> 00:36:07,997
I'm like, "What are you gonna
make it smell like?

759
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:09,382
"Ass?

760
00:36:10,652 --> 00:36:13,119
"That's what he likes.

761
00:36:13,188 --> 00:36:16,456
"Do you have an ass
candle back there?

762
00:36:16,524 --> 00:36:18,769
"Give him a hand job
and light an ass candle

763
00:36:18,793 --> 00:36:21,661
"and see if that's not
the most relaxed dog

764
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:25,614
"at the Don CeSar Hotel."

765
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,667
He'll sleep on that cushion
for nine hours.

766
00:36:27,736 --> 00:36:29,502
I know this animal.

767
00:36:33,074 --> 00:36:34,840
Hey, uh,

768
00:36:34,909 --> 00:36:37,343
do you think it's weird
that at 49 years old

769
00:36:37,412 --> 00:36:40,513
one of my testicles is just
a little bit bigger than,

770
00:36:41,916 --> 00:36:43,817
than the other two?

771
00:36:43,885 --> 00:36:45,718
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

772
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:52,909
Last... In fact, three weeks
ago, I did a run that was...

773
00:36:52,978 --> 00:36:54,978
I live in Atlanta and, uh, uh,

774
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,924
I did <i>The Tonight Show</i>
on Wednesday night,

775
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:58,459
and then I did
Billings on Thursday,

776
00:36:58,483 --> 00:37:00,078
and my manager
sold... sold it to me

777
00:37:00,102 --> 00:37:01,701
on sort of,
"It's a good routing."

778
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:05,855
You know, part of that
Atlanta-LA-Billings run

779
00:37:05,924 --> 00:37:09,359
that encompasses
the entire United States.

780
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:10,988
And... and, uh, on Friday night,

781
00:37:11,012 --> 00:37:12,445
I was in Anchorage, Alaska,

782
00:37:12,514 --> 00:37:14,380
which is real handy, and, uh,

783
00:37:14,449 --> 00:37:17,717
and someplace you really
want to see in February

784
00:37:17,786 --> 00:37:21,087
if you get... if you get
a chance. And, uh...

785
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:23,589
Then on Saturday night,
I'm in Fairbanks, Alaska,

786
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,391
and my manager's prediction

787
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,004
that there wouldn't be
a lot of snow

788
00:37:27,028 --> 00:37:28,661
in Fairbanks in February

789
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:31,881
was off by about seven
and a half freakin' feet.

790
00:37:33,785 --> 00:37:36,986
The most boring town
I've ever been to in my life.

791
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:38,988
Sorry if you're from there.

792
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:42,025
It is a borehole.

793
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:46,195
And I was stranded
there for three days.

794
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,647
Count them, one, tick.

795
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,322
Tock.

796
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,412
Tick.

797
00:38:04,732 --> 00:38:07,951
Stranded there with
the Eskimo people.

798
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:11,371
Not a great-looking
group of folks.

799
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,408
And I mentioned that onstage
and they got pissed off.

800
00:38:15,477 --> 00:38:17,121
And I didn't see
why they got so mad.

801
00:38:17,145 --> 00:38:19,412
I didn't insinuate
that they had no character.

802
00:38:19,481 --> 00:38:22,198
I mentioned that
they weren't attractive.

803
00:38:22,267 --> 00:38:24,050
I thought they knew.

804
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:30,273
Apparently, I let some
big cat out of the bag.

805
00:38:31,543 --> 00:38:33,776
Have you seen their teeth?

806
00:38:33,845 --> 00:38:35,845
They could make keys.

807
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:42,463
You don't have to be
in Fairbanks very long

808
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:43,753
before you figure out

809
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:46,121
what that nose-rubbing deal
is all about.

810
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:49,592
"I'm good."

811
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,714
Anyway,
I got this scathing letter

812
00:38:54,783 --> 00:38:55,927
from the head Eskimo,

813
00:38:55,951 --> 00:38:59,351
Frosty, or whatever
his name was and...

814
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,354
Halfway through the letter,
he said he would have me know

815
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:03,756
that the Inuit tribe is

816
00:39:03,825 --> 00:39:05,703
one of the purest races
on the planet.

817
00:39:05,727 --> 00:39:08,344
And I'm like, "That's kind of
what I'm talkin' about."

818
00:39:08,413 --> 00:39:10,780
Nobody will have
sex with these people.

819
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,067
And then later in the letter,

820
00:39:14,135 --> 00:39:16,180
it said there are
less Inuits every year,

821
00:39:16,204 --> 00:39:19,438
which I guess means
it's getting to where

822
00:39:19,507 --> 00:39:22,258
they won't even have sex
with each other.

823
00:39:27,816 --> 00:39:30,132
Somebody suggested
that I, uh, watch a movie

824
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,335
on the way to Alaska, and I did.

825
00:39:32,404 --> 00:39:34,404
It was called <i>Grizzly Man.</i>

826
00:39:34,473 --> 00:39:36,651
And you could go rent
this film or buy it.

827
00:39:36,675 --> 00:39:37,841
It's worth the watch.

828
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:39,754
It's, uh, it's
very entertaining.

829
00:39:39,778 --> 00:39:43,646
Uh, this guy, a ne'er-do-well
out-of-work actor,

830
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,860
uh, tries to reinvent
himself as a filmmaker,

831
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:48,017
and he moves into
grizzly country in Alaska,

832
00:39:48,086 --> 00:39:49,831
and shoots this amazing footage,

833
00:39:49,855 --> 00:39:52,655
which was later compiled
by Werner Herzog,

834
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:54,940
and made into this movie.
And, uh...

835
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:57,626
But, like, halfway
through the movie, he snaps

836
00:39:57,695 --> 00:40:01,664
and believes he has become
at one with the grizzly bears.

837
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:04,049
And not only do grizzly bears,
he says in this film,

838
00:40:04,118 --> 00:40:06,051
have the capacity for intellect,

839
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,204
they have
the capacity for sympathy.

840
00:40:08,273 --> 00:40:11,107
And then one of them eats him.

841
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:14,009
Funniest film
I've ever seen in my life.

842
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:17,730
I laughed till I thought
I was gonna throw up.

843
00:40:24,489 --> 00:40:26,139
The bear ate him.

844
00:40:27,709 --> 00:40:29,108
That's rich.

845
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,224
And I just thought
it would be funny

846
00:40:33,248 --> 00:40:34,792
if at any point
in this guy's life,

847
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:36,716
his father, like my father,
ever said,

848
00:40:36,784 --> 00:40:38,451
"You're never gonna be shit."

849
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,377
"Well, you're wrong, Papa.

850
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:49,779
"Tomorrow morning

851
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:52,315
"when this bear
pushes me through his bowels,

852
00:40:52,384 --> 00:40:55,718
"I'm going to become
a steaming pile of bear shit.

853
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:59,689
"I hope you're proud, Daddy.

854
00:40:59,758 --> 00:41:01,491
"You have no idea
what I've been through

855
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:04,344
"to make your dreams come true.

856
00:41:04,412 --> 00:41:06,311
"I had to be digested.

857
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:10,382
"Do you know what
that's like, Daddy?

858
00:41:10,451 --> 00:41:12,552
"I suppose you don't."

859
00:41:17,125 --> 00:41:20,226
Yeah. I get chastised publicly
and in the media

860
00:41:20,295 --> 00:41:22,406
for my position
on the death penalty,

861
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:24,291
and they don't even
know the half of it

862
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,793
because in the Moussaoui case,

863
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:28,167
I'd want to be the guy
that set the execution date,

864
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:29,819
and I'd set it for 1:00 a.m.,

865
00:41:29,888 --> 00:41:31,654
the day they set clocks forward.

866
00:41:42,016 --> 00:41:43,594
Just so I could
walk in there and go,

867
00:41:43,618 --> 00:41:46,602
"Well, looks like you got
about another hour, Moussaoui.

868
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:49,021
"Nope,
spring forward, asshole."

869
00:41:59,417 --> 00:42:01,097
And there is one
piece of legislation

870
00:42:01,152 --> 00:42:02,318
floating around right now

871
00:42:02,387 --> 00:42:04,307
that I endorse publicly
and with all my heart

872
00:42:04,356 --> 00:42:05,621
and I hope you do, too.

873
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:06,801
I believe if you're

874
00:42:06,825 --> 00:42:08,569
a convicted sex offender
in this country,

875
00:42:08,593 --> 00:42:09,959
when you get out of prison,

876
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,822
you should have to put a sign
in your yard or on your door

877
00:42:11,846 --> 00:42:13,646
that says you're a convicted
sex offender,

878
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:16,115
'cause I don't care
about your rights anymore.

879
00:42:16,184 --> 00:42:18,818
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

880
00:42:24,676 --> 00:42:25,753
And I'd also like to know

881
00:42:25,777 --> 00:42:27,154
where to get one of those signs,

882
00:42:27,178 --> 00:42:30,813
'cause I'd like to keep
some kids out of my yard.

883
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:33,002
Thanks for playin' along.
I hope you enjoyed it.

884
00:42:33,034 --> 00:42:35,551
You guys were fantastic.
Thank you.

885
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:44,827
Thank you very much.
Ladies and gentlemen,

886
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:47,029
it gives me great pride
to welcome to the stage,

887
00:42:47,098 --> 00:42:48,676
the best comedian
that ever lived,

888
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,132
Jeff Foxworthy.

889
00:42:57,275 --> 00:42:59,091
Ron White, everybody!

890
00:43:07,385 --> 00:43:08,618
I got to tell...

891
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:10,664
I really appreciate Ron
for being a part of this.

892
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:13,423
He had to leave
a New Year's Eve party

893
00:43:13,491 --> 00:43:14,958
to be here tonight.

894
00:43:18,747 --> 00:43:20,362
I'm not saying Ron drinks,

895
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:23,365
but I hugged him and
my vision is blurry. It, uh...

896
00:43:26,137 --> 00:43:27,248
Speaking of blurry vision,

897
00:43:27,272 --> 00:43:29,016
I got... I got to point this out.

898
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,141
I saw a billboard
here in Washington DC

899
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:35,912
advertising for
the vision correction surgery.

900
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,430
The billboard claimed that

901
00:43:37,498 --> 00:43:40,266
they have the cheapest
LASIK in town.

902
00:43:41,168 --> 00:43:42,346
And I'm thinking,

903
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:44,281
"If you're gonna be
operating on my eyeballs

904
00:43:44,305 --> 00:43:45,654
"with a laser beam,

905
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:48,408
"I don't want
the cheapest in town."

906
00:43:48,476 --> 00:43:52,779
I want somebody that takes
a little pride in their work.

907
00:43:52,847 --> 00:43:54,358
I don't want
to be walking around

908
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:56,927
hanging on to
a German shepherd
by a harness, braggin',

909
00:43:56,951 --> 00:43:59,501
"I just saved a bundle
on my LASIK surgery."

910
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:08,443
And if they decided to go
with "cheapest in town,"

911
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:11,330
what slogan did they pass up?

912
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:12,715
"Hey, some of our patients

913
00:44:12,784 --> 00:44:15,685
"actually kind of
see a little bit better."

914
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:19,421
"If it doesn't work,

915
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,724
"think of the money
you'll save on light bulbs."

916
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:26,345
I mean, I like savin' money.
I just don't think

917
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:29,915
medical procedures
are where you want to do it.

918
00:44:29,984 --> 00:44:32,918
I don't want the cheapest
vasectomy in town.

919
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:36,656
Climbing into a truck
behind a convenience store

920
00:44:36,724 --> 00:44:40,025
and the guy going,
"You got the 20 bucks?"

921
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,794
"All right,
listen, bite down on this rag

922
00:44:41,862 --> 00:44:44,229
"so you don't scream.

923
00:44:44,299 --> 00:44:47,600
"I can't have the neighbors
calling the police again."

924
00:44:49,637 --> 00:44:51,503
A couple of
slogans with a vasectomy

925
00:44:51,572 --> 00:44:52,650
I wouldn't want to hear,

926
00:44:52,674 --> 00:44:54,506
like, "Half off."

927
00:44:57,978 --> 00:44:59,978
"Buy one, get one free."

928
00:45:01,249 --> 00:45:04,183
I don't even know
how that would work.

929
00:45:04,252 --> 00:45:06,952
"Everything must go!"

930
00:45:07,021 --> 00:45:09,821
No, most of it better
be staying, Rufus. Uh...

931
00:45:11,526 --> 00:45:14,443
I am thrilled to be here
tonight, uh, at the, uh...

932
00:45:14,512 --> 00:45:16,312
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
Thank you.

933
00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:23,464
Last year we did
the <i>Blue Collar TV</i> thing,

934
00:45:23,488 --> 00:45:25,054
uh, last year.

935
00:45:25,123 --> 00:45:26,467
And then at the end of the year,

936
00:45:26,491 --> 00:45:27,957
I had written a book called

937
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:29,325
the <i>Redneck Dictionary.</i>

938
00:45:29,394 --> 00:45:30,560
It was words you thought

939
00:45:30,628 --> 00:45:32,328
you knew
the meaning of, all right.

940
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:38,551
Some people have
that fine piece of literature

941
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:40,887
on the back of
their toilet, I see. Uh...

942
00:45:40,955 --> 00:45:45,441
But it had words
in it like, uh, "asinine."

943
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:48,827
Uh, I'll give her face
a two and her "asinine."

944
00:45:55,537 --> 00:45:57,720
Or "wisdom."

945
00:45:57,789 --> 00:45:59,909
Uh, my brother had
two kidney stones

946
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:01,607
but he "wisdom" both out.

947
00:46:05,779 --> 00:46:08,080
Or "letter carrier."

948
00:46:08,149 --> 00:46:10,260
Uh, if she's going to
pack all that stuff,

949
00:46:10,284 --> 00:46:12,617
I say, hell,
"letter carrier" own luggage.

950
00:46:15,389 --> 00:46:16,834
But anyway, because of the book,

951
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:18,302
I was doing a lot
of book signings.

952
00:46:18,326 --> 00:46:19,870
And one of the last ones I did,

953
00:46:19,894 --> 00:46:22,261
I did a five-hour book signing

954
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:24,570
at a Wal-Mart one
Saturday afternoon,

955
00:46:24,632 --> 00:46:27,450
and during that five hours,
I had a revelation.

956
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:28,784
And that is,

957
00:46:28,853 --> 00:46:31,187
there's not
a whole lot of supermodels

958
00:46:31,256 --> 00:46:33,105
shopping at Wal-Mart.

959
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:36,525
It's pretty much
just us rednecks.

960
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:40,512
You know, and... and
we... we don't wear stuff

961
00:46:40,581 --> 00:46:42,726
'cause some magazine says
it's the latest style.

962
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:44,900
We wear stuff
'cause it's comfortable,

963
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:47,302
and if you can't look at it
and keep your lunch down,

964
00:46:47,371 --> 00:46:49,171
that's your problem.

965
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:53,859
But as kind of a spokesman

966
00:46:53,927 --> 00:46:55,472
for this portion
of the population,

967
00:46:55,496 --> 00:46:57,763
I got to thinking, you know,
it has reached the point

968
00:46:57,831 --> 00:47:02,401
where we do need
a few redneck fashion tips.

969
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:04,448
And I know a lot of you
are sitting out there

970
00:47:04,472 --> 00:47:06,015
and you're like,
"Jeff, I don't know

971
00:47:06,039 --> 00:47:07,083
"when it comes to fashion,

972
00:47:07,107 --> 00:47:10,342
"if I'm a supermodel
or a redneck."

973
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:13,479
So I came up with a few ways
to help you tell.

974
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:19,135
If the most expensive thing
you ever bought at the mall

975
00:47:19,204 --> 00:47:21,370
came from the food court,

976
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:26,375
you might want to pay attention.

977
00:47:26,444 --> 00:47:30,779
If your bra is a darker color
than your shirt,

978
00:47:32,483 --> 00:47:35,534
you might want to pay attention.

979
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:38,420
If your wife has ever
dusted the furniture

980
00:47:38,489 --> 00:47:41,724
with your
best pair of underwear,

981
00:47:43,644 --> 00:47:46,378
you might want to pay attention.

982
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:51,366
If people can see
your butt crack 24/7,

983
00:47:53,571 --> 00:47:56,439
you might want to listen up.

984
00:47:56,507 --> 00:47:59,641
If you've mastered
the art of puttin' on makeup

985
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:02,611
with your non-smokin' hand

986
00:48:05,116 --> 00:48:07,816
while drivin' with your knee,

987
00:48:11,422 --> 00:48:13,922
you might want to pay attention.

988
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:15,407
And if your thighs

989
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:19,178
stop moving
30 seconds after you do,

990
00:48:21,966 --> 00:48:24,483
some of this
might be aimed at you.

991
00:48:25,552 --> 00:48:26,835
All right, here we go.

992
00:48:26,905 --> 00:48:29,305
Redneck fashion tip number one.

993
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:34,259
Certain things should not be
sold in certain sizes.

994
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:39,665
If your rear end looks like
two full-grown raccoons

995
00:48:39,734 --> 00:48:42,735
wrestling in a 50-pound bag
of feed corn,

996
00:48:44,238 --> 00:48:46,539
say no to spandex!

997
00:48:56,967 --> 00:48:59,802
Tight ain't always right.

998
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:03,238
And the only place dimples
are cute are on your face.

999
00:49:05,176 --> 00:49:07,154
This woman came up to me
at the book signing.

1000
00:49:07,178 --> 00:49:10,613
She had the biggest butt
I have ever seen in my life.

1001
00:49:10,682 --> 00:49:12,522
And you've seen
these kind of people.

1002
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:14,617
There're like from the waist up,

1003
00:49:14,686 --> 00:49:16,719
they're built kind of normally.

1004
00:49:16,788 --> 00:49:18,554
And then from the waist down,

1005
00:49:18,623 --> 00:49:22,458
it's... it's like
an explosion took place.

1006
00:49:22,527 --> 00:49:24,960
You know, just... just huge.
I mean, from a distance,

1007
00:49:25,029 --> 00:49:27,730
she looked like a poodle
riding a Hippity Hop.

1008
00:49:27,799 --> 00:49:29,465
You know, like...

1009
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:37,656
And there's no telling
how big her butt really was

1010
00:49:37,725 --> 00:49:40,459
'cause she had it
packed in these jeans.

1011
00:49:40,528 --> 00:49:42,494
I mean, it was crammed in there.

1012
00:49:42,563 --> 00:49:44,496
I could hear the zipper cryin'.

1013
00:49:47,652 --> 00:49:48,879
You got the feeling some night

1014
00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:50,213
some guy was gonna get her home,

1015
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,665
get that top button unbuttoned,

1016
00:49:51,689 --> 00:49:53,767
and that thing was gonna
come flying out of there

1017
00:49:53,791 --> 00:49:56,107
like a Navy life raft, you know.

1018
00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:04,278
But the thing that
was intriguing about it

1019
00:50:04,302 --> 00:50:05,467
was she had this attitude

1020
00:50:05,536 --> 00:50:07,436
like she was the hottest thing
on the planet.

1021
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:10,772
And I love big girls
that think they're sexy.

1022
00:50:10,842 --> 00:50:12,585
'Cause I think guys look at them

1023
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:14,554
kind of like we do
those rodeo bulls.

1024
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:18,013
You know, we're like,
"I bet I could ride it,

1025
00:50:22,904 --> 00:50:24,970
"but I'd probably get hurt."

1026
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:30,900
So anyway,
I signed her books for her,

1027
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:32,306
and when she went to walk away,

1028
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:33,495
she wasn't just walking.

1029
00:50:33,564 --> 00:50:34,697
She was struttin'.

1030
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:37,966
I mean,
you know, like popping it.

1031
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:39,680
And I'm watching
her 'cause I'm scared

1032
00:50:39,704 --> 00:50:42,705
she's gonna knock over some
little kids or something.

1033
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:44,851
And my brother leaned over
and tapped me on the arm.

1034
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,953
He said,
"That looks like
two blue Volkswagens

1035
00:50:46,977 --> 00:50:49,928
"trying to pass each other
on a gravel road."

1036
00:50:55,036 --> 00:50:58,554
Certain things should not be
sold in certain sizes.

1037
00:50:58,623 --> 00:51:02,925
If your stomach blocks
your view of your shoes,

1038
00:51:03,527 --> 00:51:05,227
cover it up!

1039
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:14,470
The only people that
should be wearing belly shirts

1040
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:17,339
are the people that
don't have bellies.

1041
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:18,873
And there's no shame,

1042
00:51:18,942 --> 00:51:22,010
no shame in having a spare tire.

1043
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,446
Just keep it in the trunk

1044
00:51:23,514 --> 00:51:26,148
so other people
don't have to look at it.

1045
00:51:26,217 --> 00:51:28,184
(AUDIENCE CLAPPING)

1046
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:30,135
And, you know, those little
baby spare tires

1047
00:51:30,204 --> 00:51:31,237
are kind of cute.

1048
00:51:31,305 --> 00:51:33,605
Tractor tires aren't.

1049
00:51:33,674 --> 00:51:36,425
Especially when
they have hair on 'em.

1050
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:41,196
Certain things should not be
sold in certain sizes.

1051
00:51:41,265 --> 00:51:44,800
And this goes to a lot of dads
and uncles out here.

1052
00:51:44,869 --> 00:51:49,371
Your shorts are supposed to be
longer than your underwear.

1053
00:51:51,075 --> 00:51:53,976
Especially if you
wear tighty whities.

1054
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:58,380
Nobody wants to be
at the family picnic

1055
00:51:58,449 --> 00:52:00,866
and look over at Uncle Fred
sitting in a lawn chair

1056
00:52:00,952 --> 00:52:04,269
and see anything
that looks like a baby bird.

1057
00:52:11,979 --> 00:52:13,144
And talking about shorts,

1058
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,246
I gotta comment
on those little cotton shorts

1059
00:52:15,315 --> 00:52:18,366
that have the words
printed on the back of 'em.

1060
00:52:18,435 --> 00:52:19,585
First of all, guys,

1061
00:52:19,653 --> 00:52:22,020
if you can't read
without movin' your lips,

1062
00:52:22,956 --> 00:52:24,656
do not stare at these shorts

1063
00:52:24,725 --> 00:52:26,891
in front of your wife
or girlfriend.

1064
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,588
And for God sakes, don't pretend

1065
00:52:28,612 --> 00:52:30,223
you've had
the cheap LASIK surgery

1066
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:33,448
and you can only read by
using Braille, you know?

1067
00:52:36,053 --> 00:52:38,603
But these shorts bring up
my second fashion rule,

1068
00:52:38,672 --> 00:52:42,207
and that is there has
got to be an age limit

1069
00:52:42,276 --> 00:52:44,609
on certain articles of clothing.

1070
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:49,331
Got to be.

1071
00:52:49,399 --> 00:52:50,827
And with these
little cotton shorts

1072
00:52:50,851 --> 00:52:51,891
with the words on 'em,

1073
00:52:51,952 --> 00:52:53,551
I think the age limit is what?

1074
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:55,187
15? 16?

1075
00:52:55,823 --> 00:52:57,489
All I'm saying is that

1076
00:52:57,558 --> 00:53:00,125
if the veins
in the back of your legs

1077
00:53:00,194 --> 00:53:03,428
look like the street map
of Greater Pittsburgh,

1078
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:06,999
you ain't nobody's baby doll.

1079
00:53:11,205 --> 00:53:14,590
If your thighs look like
the hood of a white Toyota van

1080
00:53:14,659 --> 00:53:16,358
after a hailstorm,

1081
00:53:17,261 --> 00:53:19,195
you're not Juicy.

1082
00:53:24,468 --> 00:53:26,402
You might be
a terrific grandmother,

1083
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:27,936
you're not Juicy.

1084
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:31,623
And this age-limit rule

1085
00:53:31,692 --> 00:53:35,177
also applies to
low-cut tops on women.

1086
00:53:35,246 --> 00:53:37,057
And... and you know
what I'm talking about,

1087
00:53:37,081 --> 00:53:39,581
these women that insist on
showing their cleavage

1088
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:42,417
30 years after
anybody wants to see it.

1089
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:45,687
And they're always well-endowed.

1090
00:53:45,756 --> 00:53:47,623
I mean real well-endowed.

1091
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:49,811
They are the kind of women,
if they go to hug you,

1092
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:53,312
and you're not chewing gum,
your ears are going to pop.

1093
00:53:54,732 --> 00:53:57,666
But that cleavage line's like
three feet long,

1094
00:53:57,735 --> 00:54:00,569
and it's got these little
wrinkles coming off of it.

1095
00:54:00,638 --> 00:54:02,705
Looks like you're looking down
into the Grand Canyon

1096
00:54:02,773 --> 00:54:04,673
out an airplane window.

1097
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:07,643
And what is it?

1098
00:54:07,712 --> 00:54:09,322
There's some women,
the older they get,

1099
00:54:09,346 --> 00:54:11,780
just, the less modest they are.

1100
00:54:11,849 --> 00:54:12,969
And everybody's done this,

1101
00:54:13,017 --> 00:54:14,761
where you're sitting
there in the morning

1102
00:54:14,785 --> 00:54:16,625
having a cup of
coffee with Granny.

1103
00:54:16,654 --> 00:54:18,098
And she's not wearing anything,

1104
00:54:18,122 --> 00:54:21,022
but a paper-thin
nightgown and a smile.

1105
00:54:21,709 --> 00:54:23,108
Then she'll bend down

1106
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:24,810
to pick up
something out of the floor,

1107
00:54:24,878 --> 00:54:26,611
and suddenly
you're staring at something

1108
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,792
that looks like
those long balloons

1109
00:54:28,816 --> 00:54:30,949
four days after
the birthday party.

1110
00:54:38,376 --> 00:54:40,509
And they ain't
floating up to the ceiling,

1111
00:54:40,578 --> 00:54:42,711
they are on the floor.

1112
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:46,081
Hell, you could step on them
and they wouldn't pop.

1113
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:52,621
Fashion rule number three.

1114
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:55,357
Tattoos are not for everybody.

1115
00:54:57,695 --> 00:54:58,695
When I was a kid,

1116
00:54:58,762 --> 00:55:00,106
the only people that had tattoos

1117
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,130
were old guys
that had been in the Navy.

1118
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:03,944
You know, and theirs
were kind of blurry.

1119
00:55:03,968 --> 00:55:05,762
In fact, you couldn't
even tell what they were.

1120
00:55:05,786 --> 00:55:06,913
You were staring at it, going,

1121
00:55:06,937 --> 00:55:09,004
"Well, it's either
a naked woman or Willie Nelson

1122
00:55:09,073 --> 00:55:11,990
"using post-hole diggers."

1123
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:14,993
But it was the old Navy guys
and... and Hells Angels.

1124
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:16,439
But they had the scary tattoos.

1125
00:55:16,463 --> 00:55:17,807
You know,
like on their knuckles,

1126
00:55:17,831 --> 00:55:19,565
like "love" and "hate."

1127
00:55:19,633 --> 00:55:20,866
My cousin had that,

1128
00:55:20,935 --> 00:55:22,879
and then one summer
he got a job in the carnival,

1129
00:55:22,903 --> 00:55:24,347
and he got his pinkie
chopped off.

1130
00:55:24,371 --> 00:55:26,304
Now his hands say,
"Love hat."

1131
00:55:27,608 --> 00:55:30,308
Ooh, that's intimidating.

1132
00:55:30,377 --> 00:55:32,210
And I don't have anything
against tattoos.

1133
00:55:32,279 --> 00:55:34,145
I don't have one, myself.

1134
00:55:34,214 --> 00:55:35,313
If... if I did,

1135
00:55:35,382 --> 00:55:37,232
it would be right there
next to my watch,

1136
00:55:37,284 --> 00:55:40,169
it would say,
"Your wife's birthday
is August 2,

1137
00:55:40,237 --> 00:55:42,237
"your anniversary
is September 18,

1138
00:55:42,306 --> 00:55:45,607
"don't let Ron White
drive your car again,"
you know.

1139
00:55:52,733 --> 00:55:57,302
All I'm saying with tattoos
is you have to plan ahead
just a little bit.

1140
00:55:57,371 --> 00:55:59,638
You know, because I think
a lot of tattoos are cool

1141
00:55:59,706 --> 00:56:02,307
when you're young
and your skin is taut.

1142
00:56:02,376 --> 00:56:05,244
But as you get older,
that skin's gonna
start sagging.

1143
00:56:05,312 --> 00:56:07,946
You know, ladies,
like that... that little
hummingbird.

1144
00:56:08,015 --> 00:56:10,149
It's real cute when you're 20.

1145
00:56:10,217 --> 00:56:13,918
But that bird is
going to fly south
for the winter.

1146
00:56:13,987 --> 00:56:16,833
And 20 years down the road,
you don't want
your grandkids crying,

1147
00:56:16,857 --> 00:56:18,935
going, "I don't want
to stay with Grandma,

1148
00:56:18,959 --> 00:56:21,426
"she's got a buzzard
on her back!"

1149
00:56:24,965 --> 00:56:26,560
'Cause when that skin
starts sagging,

1150
00:56:26,584 --> 00:56:29,601
suddenly that dolphin
is a beluga whale.

1151
00:56:30,871 --> 00:56:33,605
And that rose is Rosie O'Donnell

1152
00:56:34,941 --> 00:56:37,009
with a mouthful of leaves.

1153
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:39,289
And something else
to think about.

1154
00:56:39,313 --> 00:56:40,778
You know
it's going to be real hard

1155
00:56:40,847 --> 00:56:42,792
for your kids
to take you seriously
when you tell them,

1156
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:44,660
"Say no to drugs," and you got

1157
00:56:44,684 --> 00:56:47,185
a pot plant
tattooed to your neck.

1158
00:56:47,254 --> 00:56:48,620
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

1159
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:54,008
Fashion rule number four.

1160
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:57,713
If you've given birth
more than five times,

1161
00:56:57,781 --> 00:57:02,150
a tank top is not
an acceptable substitute
for a bra.

1162
00:57:07,391 --> 00:57:09,202
There was this lady
at the book signing,

1163
00:57:09,226 --> 00:57:11,192
and I don't know
what had happened to her

1164
00:57:11,262 --> 00:57:15,029
to cause this particular
breast configuration,

1165
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:18,800
but she had one under each arm.

1166
00:57:18,869 --> 00:57:21,703
She looked like
a watermelon delivery boy.

1167
00:57:24,257 --> 00:57:26,091
Tank tops aren't good
on anybody,

1168
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,493
especially those low-cut ones.

1169
00:57:28,562 --> 00:57:31,480
You know, if your skin
is the color of Cool Whip

1170
00:57:31,548 --> 00:57:34,983
and you have a mole
that looks like
an oatmeal pie,

1171
00:57:36,086 --> 00:57:38,786
let that be your little secret.

1172
00:57:40,691 --> 00:57:43,459
Guys, if you have
back titties...

1173
00:57:48,632 --> 00:57:50,009
I didn't know if you would know

1174
00:57:50,033 --> 00:57:52,701
what I was talking about
there. You...

1175
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:54,347
The kind of guys that are
walking through the mall

1176
00:57:54,371 --> 00:57:57,522
and nursing babies
are going, "Num-num, num-num."

1177
00:58:04,581 --> 00:58:06,314
Also, if your back's so hairy,

1178
00:58:06,383 --> 00:58:10,268
you've been shot
more than twice
with a tranquilizer gun,

1179
00:58:10,337 --> 00:58:12,487
say yes to sleeves.

1180
00:58:13,807 --> 00:58:16,675
I hope Larry is listening
to some of this.

by reading our clothes.

1188
00:58:41,952 --> 00:58:44,547
You give me
a redneck man's
T-shirt drawer,

1189
00:58:44,571 --> 00:58:46,605
I can tell you
what kind of truck he drives,

1190
00:58:46,673 --> 00:58:49,974
what radio station
he listens to,
who he roots for in NASCAR,

1191
00:58:50,043 --> 00:58:53,295
what he likes to hunt,
who his favorite
college football team is,

1192
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:54,713
his philosophy on life,

1193
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:58,000
and where he went on vacation
the last 21 summers.

1194
00:59:06,026 --> 00:59:07,403
And you give me his windbreaker,

1195
00:59:07,427 --> 00:59:10,561
I'll tell you
what kind of cigarettes
he smokes.

1196
00:59:12,449 --> 00:59:15,228
Also, with T-shirts,
guys, if you weigh
more than 400 pounds,

1197
00:59:15,252 --> 00:59:18,987
it's not okay to wear
a T-shirt that says,
"No Fat Chicks."

1198
00:59:20,858 --> 00:59:24,959
You ought to be
wearing one that says,
"I whipped anorexia's ass."

1199
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:32,700
And do not wear
an "I'm With Stupid" T-shirt

1200
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:34,669
if you're by yourself.

1201
00:59:38,975 --> 00:59:41,976
And if you do,
well, I'd say that's right.

1202
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:48,366
Fashion rule number six.

1203
00:59:48,435 --> 00:59:53,738
God invented
closed-toed shoes
for a reason.

1204
00:59:53,807 --> 00:59:58,776
Why is it the people
with the nastiest feet
always wear flip-flops?

1205
00:59:59,947 --> 01:00:01,457
You know what I'm talking about?

1206
01:00:01,481 --> 01:00:04,649
If you have so many corns
you have to put up
a scarecrow,

1207
01:00:05,618 --> 01:00:08,870
say no to the flip-flop.

1208
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:10,772
If your toenails are so long

1209
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:13,941
you can swoop down on a lake
and catch a trout,

1210
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:18,396
say no to the flip-flop.

1211
01:00:18,465 --> 01:00:21,366
If you have a toenail
that's three different colors

1212
01:00:21,435 --> 01:00:23,635
and none of them
are nail polish,

1213
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:28,657
say no to the flip-flop.

1214
01:00:31,928 --> 01:00:33,339
My next fashion rule,
and this is

1215
01:00:33,363 --> 01:00:36,264
for some of you
younger folks out there,

1216
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:39,984
if your mother
still drives you to school,

1217
01:00:40,054 --> 01:00:43,655
you ain't no gangster,
pull your pants up.

1218
01:00:56,403 --> 01:00:58,031
The back pockets of your pants

1219
01:00:58,055 --> 01:01:01,056
should not be behind your knees.

1220
01:01:01,125 --> 01:01:03,103
And I don't know why
I have to look at
the underwear

1221
01:01:03,127 --> 01:01:05,410
of every teenage boy in America.

1222
01:01:06,313 --> 01:01:07,673
You know, when I was in school,

1223
01:01:07,697 --> 01:01:09,275
if other people
could see your underwear,

1224
01:01:09,299 --> 01:01:11,849
it was because two bullies
had cornered you
on the playground

1225
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:14,703
and they'd yanked
it up to your neck.

1226
01:01:15,972 --> 01:01:17,350
Which is why as adults, most men

1227
01:01:17,374 --> 01:01:19,002
won't even consider
wearing a thong

1228
01:01:19,026 --> 01:01:22,243
'cause those are memories
we're trying to repress,
you know.

1229
01:01:24,147 --> 01:01:26,497
And my last fashion rule.

1230
01:01:26,566 --> 01:01:29,167
Husbands and wives
should never dress alike,

1231
01:01:29,236 --> 01:01:31,469
unless you're going
to a Garth Brooks concert

1232
01:01:31,538 --> 01:01:33,371
or a Halloween party.

1233
01:01:36,676 --> 01:01:39,327
I have only dressed
like my wife one time

1234
01:01:39,396 --> 01:01:40,595
in our 20-year marriage,

1235
01:01:40,664 --> 01:01:42,308
and it was the biggest mistake
I'd ever made.

1236
01:01:42,332 --> 01:01:44,611
You... you cannot describe
this little adventure

1237
01:01:44,635 --> 01:01:48,202
without the word
"cluster" in it.

1238
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:50,972
She wanted
to go hunting with me
to see what it was all about,

1239
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:53,219
so I got her
a camouflaged outfit,
and she never shut up.

1240
01:01:53,243 --> 01:01:55,254
She never shut up
the entire time.

1241
01:01:55,278 --> 01:01:56,489
We're walking through the woods

1242
01:01:56,513 --> 01:01:57,940
and she's like,
"It is so dirty out here.

1243
01:01:57,964 --> 01:01:59,625
"I cannot believe
leaves and sticks
are everywhere.

1244
01:01:59,649 --> 01:02:03,117
"Can you believe
how dirty it is?
Nobody ever cleans this up?

1245
01:02:03,186 --> 01:02:06,003
"Oh, God, look at that.
I got mud on my new boots.

1246
01:02:06,072 --> 01:02:08,840
"Oh, I hope that comes out.
I love these little boots.

1247
01:02:08,909 --> 01:02:10,536
"You know,
they were originally $129,

1248
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:13,161
"but I got them for $59.95.
You wanna know why?

1249
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:16,481
"They're last year's boots.
I don't think anybody'll know.
Do you?

1250
01:02:16,549 --> 01:02:19,400
"Oh, God,
there's a bug on my pants.
Get him off, get him off.

1251
01:02:19,469 --> 01:02:22,671
"Get him off.
Well, don't kill him,
he's just a little bug.

1252
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:24,834
"He's probably looking
for his bug family.

1253
01:02:24,858 --> 01:02:27,003
"Here, hold my binoculars,
'cause I gotta
straighten my hat up.

1254
01:02:27,027 --> 01:02:29,060
"Are my bangs even?

1255
01:02:29,129 --> 01:02:31,707
"Are they really even
or are you just saying that?
Are they even?

1256
01:02:31,731 --> 01:02:34,082
"Does this coat
make me look too fat?

1257
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:35,895
"I don't like this coat.
I liked it
when I first put it on,

1258
01:02:35,919 --> 01:02:37,463
"but now I think
it makes my hips look fat.

1259
01:02:37,487 --> 01:02:39,582
"Don't you think so?
Where are all the deer?

1260
01:02:39,606 --> 01:02:40,783
"You said there were
going to be deer out here.

1261
01:02:40,807 --> 01:02:42,306
"I don't see one single deer.

1262
01:02:42,375 --> 01:02:45,409
"Is this going to take
a long time?

1263
01:02:45,478 --> 01:02:49,865
"H-how come you're
putting your gun
in your mouth?"

1264
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:53,685
You guys have been great.
God bless you,
thank you for this.

1265
01:02:54,954 --> 01:02:57,772
You guys are awesome.
Thank you.

1266
01:02:59,943 --> 01:03:01,743
Thank you very much.

1267
01:03:03,796 --> 01:03:05,363
Thank you.

1268
01:03:05,432 --> 01:03:06,875
All right, y'all,
keep it going for

1269
01:03:06,899 --> 01:03:08,644
one of my dearest
friends in the world

1270
01:03:08,668 --> 01:03:10,863
and the next president
of the United States,

1271
01:03:10,887 --> 01:03:12,470
Larry, the Cable Guy!

1272
01:03:13,189 --> 01:03:14,656
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

1273
01:03:24,468 --> 01:03:25,633
LARRY: All right.

1274
01:03:25,702 --> 01:03:27,352
There goes Jeff.

1275
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:28,853
All right.

1276
01:03:28,922 --> 01:03:30,305
Thank you.

1277
01:03:33,093 --> 01:03:35,204
Thank you,
I had to get my underwear
out of my crack.

1278
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:36,827
All right.

1279
01:03:36,897 --> 01:03:38,329
Git-R-Done.

1280
01:03:41,284 --> 01:03:42,683
Thank you.

1281
01:03:42,752 --> 01:03:45,198
That's right,
that's all I do.
I come out and I go,

1282
01:03:45,222 --> 01:03:47,116
"Git-R-Done. That's $100.
Get the hell out of here."

1283
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:48,506
All right, yeah, excuse me.

1284
01:03:50,110 --> 01:03:52,978
Well, thank you so much.
Good to see you.

1285
01:03:53,046 --> 01:03:55,086
I didn't think I was
gonna make it here.

1286
01:03:55,148 --> 01:03:57,649
I was in Pennsylvania

1287
01:03:57,718 --> 01:04:00,919
doing a thing
for the Playboy Channel
down there.

1288
01:04:00,988 --> 01:04:04,689
Uh, I was, uh, filming
<i>Amish Girls Gone Wild</i>

1289
01:04:04,758 --> 01:04:08,076
down there
for the Playboy Channel show.

1290
01:04:08,128 --> 01:04:10,461
It's kind of tough
to get their bonnets off,

1291
01:04:10,530 --> 01:04:12,964
but once we did,
they warmed up pretty good.

1292
01:04:13,033 --> 01:04:14,799
I'll tell you. That's right.

1293
01:04:14,867 --> 01:04:18,019
"Yeah, churn that butter,
honey, churn that butter.

1294
01:04:18,088 --> 01:04:20,805
"Oh, that's good
right there."

1295
01:04:20,873 --> 01:04:24,508
I'm kind of irritated, though,
we was driving back
in the car

1296
01:04:24,577 --> 01:04:26,244
and had a accident.

1297
01:04:26,313 --> 01:04:29,981
I'm gonna sue Geico Insurance.

1298
01:04:30,049 --> 01:04:32,879
We had a accident
and they sent out
an actual lizard

1299
01:04:32,903 --> 01:04:35,904
to handle the claim,
for God's sake.

1300
01:04:35,972 --> 01:04:37,038
What in the world?

1301
01:04:37,107 --> 01:04:38,450
I was madder than a Keebler Elf

1302
01:04:38,474 --> 01:04:39,852
getting demoted to fudge packer.

1303
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:42,360
I tell you what,
I couldn't believe.

1304
01:04:43,330 --> 01:04:45,780
That's upset there.

1305
01:04:45,849 --> 01:04:49,217
That's upset right there.
That's right.

1306
01:04:50,654 --> 01:04:53,087
I like to travel.
I was up in Canada,

1307
01:04:53,156 --> 01:04:55,156
up there
at the Calgary Stampede.

1308
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:56,457
I like the rodeo.

1309
01:04:56,526 --> 01:04:57,770
I tell you,
I wish I could do that,

1310
01:04:57,794 --> 01:04:59,360
but I'm too out of shape
for that.

1311
01:04:59,429 --> 01:05:02,463
But my sister did it
for a long time, and...

1312
01:05:02,532 --> 01:05:04,982
She did. She was good.
They ended up retiring her.

1313
01:05:05,051 --> 01:05:06,962
Nobody could stay on her
for eight years.

1314
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:09,521
I tell you what, she was...

1315
01:05:09,589 --> 01:05:11,523
She was mean.

1316
01:05:11,591 --> 01:05:13,057
She was mean.

1317
01:05:13,126 --> 01:05:15,505
I'll tell you, the cowboys
called her a mother bucker
for many years.

1318
01:05:15,529 --> 01:05:18,496
I'll tell you, she was...
She was a mean one.

1319
01:05:18,564 --> 01:05:19,641
But I'm going to tell you what.

1320
01:05:19,665 --> 01:05:22,566
This is such a thrill
to do this.

1321
01:05:22,635 --> 01:05:25,414
And I'm gonna
tell you something, though,
this ain't all roses up here.

1322
01:05:25,438 --> 01:05:29,307
I got some women
trying to get money
from me right now.

1323
01:05:29,376 --> 01:05:32,143
They threatening to release
these sex tapes

1324
01:05:32,212 --> 01:05:36,314
I made with them
about 17 years ago,

1325
01:05:36,383 --> 01:05:39,083
and it just really
upsets you, you know?

1326
01:05:39,152 --> 01:05:40,896
You finally make a little money

1327
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:43,354
and then you got relatives
coming out of the woodwork.

1328
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:45,723
You know what I mean, don't you?

1329
01:05:48,344 --> 01:05:51,012
Pissed me off.

1330
01:05:51,081 --> 01:05:53,709
Tell you what, though.
I'm trying to get in
shape a little bit.

1331
01:05:53,733 --> 01:05:57,502
I put on 22 pounds
over the holidays,

1332
01:05:57,571 --> 01:06:00,305
and I guess that's a lot
for Arbor Day, I guess.

1333
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:02,640
I ain't sure, but...

1334
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:05,020
Trying to lose
a little bit of weight,
though.

1335
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:07,945
My Japanese neighbor's
starting to call me
"Gutzilla."

1336
01:06:08,014 --> 01:06:09,980
So I got to do
something with that.

1337
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:14,302
But I blame a lot of that
on the holidays and stuff,

1338
01:06:14,371 --> 01:06:17,172
and I always try to make
my New Year's resolutions

1339
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:19,252
to not gain weight,
but I didn't do that
this year.

1340
01:06:19,276 --> 01:06:22,227
I made two different ones,
and I've kept them so far.

1341
01:06:22,295 --> 01:06:24,929
Uh, well, one.
I ate a booger yesterday.

1342
01:06:24,997 --> 01:06:27,843
All right,
I didn't do that one,
but I couldn't help it.

1343
01:06:27,867 --> 01:06:31,252
It was dry air
and it was a good one, too.
You know what I mean?

1344
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:32,803
Well, you can't help it.

1345
01:06:32,872 --> 01:06:34,716
You don't want to
but you're like,
"Oh, oh, what the hell?"

1346
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:35,973
You know, I...

1347
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:40,578
But I said
I was going to eat more
and get fat.

1348
01:06:40,647 --> 01:06:42,825
And I have done that.
So that's a good thing.

1349
01:06:42,849 --> 01:06:44,627
But you know what irritates me?

1350
01:06:44,651 --> 01:06:49,287
Did you ever read the label
on your Butterball turkey
over the holidays?

1351
01:06:51,325 --> 01:06:54,659
Anybody speak English at all,

1352
01:06:54,728 --> 01:06:58,613
or... or am I way off
on the turkey deal?
You don't eat turkey? Or...

1353
01:06:59,783 --> 01:07:03,401
My turkey said,
"Sweet, young, and juicy"

1354
01:07:04,337 --> 01:07:06,037
right on the daggum label.

1355
01:07:06,106 --> 01:07:07,572
That ain't right.

1356
01:07:07,641 --> 01:07:10,541
I had my pants unsnapped
before we ate the meal
this year.

1357
01:07:10,611 --> 01:07:12,527
I'll tell you that much.

1358
01:07:12,596 --> 01:07:15,647
LARRY: That's right.

1359
01:07:15,715 --> 01:07:19,184
But I do like food.
I'll tell you what,
I enjoy it.

1360
01:07:19,253 --> 01:07:22,454
The Waffle House.
That's one of my
favorite places right there.

1361
01:07:22,522 --> 01:07:24,622
I like the Waffle House.

1362
01:07:24,691 --> 01:07:25,757
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

1363
01:07:25,826 --> 01:07:27,625
Smothered and covered, by God.

1364
01:07:27,694 --> 01:07:31,014
You're a Communist
if you don't eat it
smothered and covered.

1365
01:07:31,065 --> 01:07:33,826
But don't eat it too late,
'cause you'll eat it
smothered and covered

1366
01:07:33,850 --> 01:07:37,753
and it'll come out
scattered and splattered,
I guaran-damn-tee.

1367
01:07:37,821 --> 01:07:38,887
It ain't funny.

1368
01:07:38,956 --> 01:07:40,466
Good Lord,
I could have bent over

1369
01:07:40,490 --> 01:07:43,759
and pooped through
a keyhole in there.
It was ridiculous.

1370
01:07:43,827 --> 01:07:45,738
I was madder than
a one-legged waitress

1371
01:07:45,762 --> 01:07:48,930
working at the IHOP,
I tell you what.

1372
01:07:48,998 --> 01:07:50,815
Here's your pancakes.

1373
01:07:53,887 --> 01:07:55,815
But it's good to be in old DC.

1374
01:07:55,839 --> 01:07:57,483
I used to date a gal from here

1375
01:07:57,507 --> 01:07:59,942
a few years ago, and...
I did.

1376
01:08:00,010 --> 01:08:02,110
We ended up breaking up.
It was mutual.

1377
01:08:02,179 --> 01:08:06,064
Her and her husband told me
to get the hell out,
so I did.

1378
01:08:07,350 --> 01:08:10,735
Dated another gal
a few years ago,
and she scared me.

1379
01:08:10,803 --> 01:08:13,203
She come up to me
one morning.
She said, "Well, pretty soon

1380
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:14,517
"you're gonna hear
the pitter-patter

1381
01:08:14,541 --> 01:08:16,186
"of little feet
around the house."

1382
01:08:16,210 --> 01:08:18,609
I'm like,
"Oh, Lord, she's pregnant."

1383
01:08:18,678 --> 01:08:20,963
She ended up leaving me
for a midget.

1384
01:08:23,767 --> 01:08:25,851
I used to date
a little midget girl

1385
01:08:25,919 --> 01:08:28,086
as a matter of fact,
about that tall.

1386
01:08:28,154 --> 01:08:32,557
Good Lord, I loved her.
I was nuts over her.
I tell you, I was.

1387
01:08:33,978 --> 01:08:35,360
I loved her.

1388
01:08:37,397 --> 01:08:38,879
That's right.

1389
01:08:40,267 --> 01:08:42,583
We didn't date too long.
No, she irritated me.

1390
01:08:42,652 --> 01:08:44,686
She kept sticking her nose
in my business.

1391
01:08:44,754 --> 01:08:46,354
You know what I mean? Just...

1392
01:08:51,745 --> 01:08:55,480
Let's see, but I did,
I got married
about seven months ago.

1393
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:57,165
MAN: Yeah.

1394
01:08:57,234 --> 01:09:00,885
And, oh, don't...
Hey, don't clap.
We're already having trouble.

1395
01:09:00,954 --> 01:09:02,437
And

1396
01:09:02,505 --> 01:09:05,440
apparently you
can't talk dirty
to your wife's sister

1397
01:09:05,509 --> 01:09:08,109
on the telephone, I guess.

1398
01:09:08,178 --> 01:09:11,446
Didn't really
read the rulebook
on all that.

1399
01:09:11,515 --> 01:09:13,759
But I love her, though.
You can tell
when you in love.

1400
01:09:13,783 --> 01:09:16,117
I didn't think I ever could,
but God bless her.

1401
01:09:16,186 --> 01:09:19,487
She's the only girl
I ever made love to
with my pants completely off.

1402
01:09:19,556 --> 01:09:21,556
I'll tell you, there's a...

1403
01:09:21,625 --> 01:09:25,544
There was a connection there
from the beginning.

1404
01:09:25,612 --> 01:09:27,528
I'll tell you
what's really cool about her,

1405
01:09:27,597 --> 01:09:29,897
she looks like
my favorite country singer.

1406
01:09:29,950 --> 01:09:31,733
That's a turn-on right there.

1407
01:09:31,801 --> 01:09:35,237
You see your singer on TV
and then you married somebody
that look like...

1408
01:09:35,305 --> 01:09:36,733
I mean, we was walking
down the street
the other day.

1409
01:09:36,757 --> 01:09:38,022
I was so daggum proud,

1410
01:09:38,091 --> 01:09:40,024
people was like,
"Look, there's Travis Tritt!"

1411
01:09:40,093 --> 01:09:43,194
"Look at that, right there,
it's Travis Tritt!"

1412
01:09:45,165 --> 01:09:46,430
That's right.

1413
01:09:46,499 --> 01:09:48,644
She looks a little like him
from the back like this.

1414
01:09:48,668 --> 01:09:52,703
I'll tell you,
a little T-R-O-U-B-L-E
coming my way.

1415
01:09:53,874 --> 01:09:56,440
We got us a baby on the way,
August 4.

1416
01:09:56,509 --> 01:09:58,109
We pretty excited about that.

1417
01:09:58,178 --> 01:09:59,911
We...

1418
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:03,447
LARRY: Yeah, that's going
to be pretty cool.

1419
01:10:03,516 --> 01:10:05,583
Going to be cool.
We ordered her from China.

1420
01:10:05,652 --> 01:10:07,363
So hopefully
she'll get here then,

1421
01:10:07,387 --> 01:10:09,320
you know,
if she ain't here by the 4th,

1422
01:10:09,389 --> 01:10:10,867
then I blowed 20 bucks on a cake

1423
01:10:10,891 --> 01:10:12,769
that says, "Welcome, Ling Chau,"

1424
01:10:12,793 --> 01:10:14,833
all right, I'll tell you that.

1425
01:10:18,298 --> 01:10:20,943
No, but she is
going to have a baby.
I'm so proud.

1426
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:24,101
She wants a little boy,
I want a 16-year-old
Polynesian girl.

1427
01:10:24,170 --> 01:10:27,022
That's what I want, right there.

1428
01:10:27,090 --> 01:10:30,892
Hopefully we can figure
that whole thing out,
right there.

1429
01:10:30,961 --> 01:10:32,493
You know.

1430
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:35,496
But I'm from a small town.

1431
01:10:35,565 --> 01:10:39,267
Uh, you got to
create things to do.
I like to fish and hunt

1432
01:10:39,335 --> 01:10:41,136
and throw rocks at whores.

1433
01:10:41,204 --> 01:10:43,071
We used to do that a lot.

1434
01:10:43,139 --> 01:10:45,273
But that was
a church function, there.

1435
01:10:45,341 --> 01:10:48,660
That was, but...

1436
01:10:48,729 --> 01:10:53,581
Fishing. I love fishing.
That's a lot of fun, there.
I tell you what, I was...

1437
01:10:53,650 --> 01:10:56,751
I was standing on my porch
the other day,
looking at some stars

1438
01:10:56,820 --> 01:11:00,255
through my telescope,
'cause my neighbor'd
put her top back on,

1439
01:11:02,859 --> 01:11:05,204
and my buddy goes,
"You want to go fishing
in the morning?"

1440
01:11:05,228 --> 01:11:07,262
I'm like, "Daggum.
Git-R-Done."

1441
01:11:07,331 --> 01:11:11,316
Right, and he said,
"Well, we need to be
on the lake at 5:00 a.m."

1442
01:11:11,885 --> 01:11:13,218
Come again?

1443
01:11:13,854 --> 01:11:15,486
5:00 a.m.?

1444
01:11:15,555 --> 01:11:17,333
You couldn't get me
on a cheerleader

1445
01:11:17,357 --> 01:11:19,517
at 5:00 a.m.,
I'll tell you that.

1446
01:11:21,244 --> 01:11:23,812
What in the world?

1447
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:25,279
(LAUGHS)

1448
01:11:25,348 --> 01:11:27,443
Well, you could,
but she'd have to
bring her own rod,

1449
01:11:27,467 --> 01:11:29,868
I guarantee you that.

1450
01:11:29,936 --> 01:11:34,272
There'd be nothing
working on me
at that hour, there.

1451
01:11:34,340 --> 01:11:38,143
Went trout fishing one time
and didn't get nothing
for seven hours.

1452
01:11:38,211 --> 01:11:42,147
And then I farted in my waders
and four trout
come up for air.

1453
01:11:43,383 --> 01:11:44,516
Daggum.

1454
01:11:44,584 --> 01:11:46,211
If I'd have had
one more bowl of chili,

1455
01:11:46,235 --> 01:11:49,370
I'd have got 10 of them
daggum things in there.

1456
01:11:49,439 --> 01:11:53,190
I just wasn't prepared.
I wasn't prepared.

1457
01:11:53,259 --> 01:11:57,161
Wasn't prepared.
But I do love to fish,
and I'll tell you what.

1458
01:11:57,230 --> 01:12:00,565
They got all kinds of fish.
You ever heard
of Orange Roughy?

1459
01:12:00,634 --> 01:12:01,911
ALL: Yeah.
You...

1460
01:12:01,935 --> 01:12:04,469
I didn't even know
that was a fish.

1461
01:12:04,538 --> 01:12:07,972
I thought that was
what you took after you ate
a bag of Cheez Doodles.

1462
01:12:14,214 --> 01:12:15,580
Good Lord.

1463
01:12:15,649 --> 01:12:18,769
Went fishing
in Miami one time
and caught a Cuban.

1464
01:12:19,653 --> 01:12:21,703
(LARRY LAUGHS)
LARRY: That's funny.

1465
01:12:21,771 --> 01:12:23,955
Good Lord.

1466
01:12:24,024 --> 01:12:25,456
It was unbelievable.

1467
01:12:25,525 --> 01:12:29,327
There was a whole
school of them down there,
I couldn't believe it.

1468
01:12:29,412 --> 01:12:30,879
But I felt bad.

1469
01:12:30,947 --> 01:12:32,692
I had my limit
and I had to throw
the little feller back.

1470
01:12:32,716 --> 01:12:34,616
I felt bad about it.

1471
01:12:34,668 --> 01:12:36,300
You ever do this?

1472
01:12:36,369 --> 01:12:39,048
You ever throw firecrackers
in the water,
watch the fish come up?

1473
01:12:39,072 --> 01:12:40,538
That's fun, right there.

1474
01:12:40,607 --> 01:12:44,109
We was throwing M-80's in,
fish flying up.

1475
01:12:44,177 --> 01:12:45,755
That's right.
We blew the aquarium

1476
01:12:45,779 --> 01:12:49,030
at the dentist's office
all to hell, we done that.

1477
01:12:50,650 --> 01:12:52,610
I thought it was funny, I did.

1478
01:12:52,636 --> 01:12:54,669
But we was kids,
we was about 25,

1479
01:12:54,738 --> 01:12:57,471
so we didn't know
what we was doing then.

1480
01:12:58,508 --> 01:13:00,207
Went fishing one time,

1481
01:13:00,276 --> 01:13:05,914
uh, for catfish
using shrimp as bait,
which makes no sense at all.

1482
01:13:05,982 --> 01:13:07,949
Does that make any sense?
MAN: No.

1483
01:13:08,018 --> 01:13:10,284
Fishing for a fish
that's $2 a pound

1484
01:13:10,353 --> 01:13:14,055
with a fish
that's $9.99 a pound?

1485
01:13:14,123 --> 01:13:17,475
I ended up eating the bait,
that's what I did.

1486
01:13:17,544 --> 01:13:20,878
"How come you ain't
fishing for catfish?"
"We got shrimp."

1487
01:13:22,933 --> 01:13:25,494
I like to hunt.
That's one of my
favorite things.

1488
01:13:25,518 --> 01:13:28,553
Need to be careful, though.
My brother's not
a very good hunter.

1489
01:13:28,621 --> 01:13:31,823
He shot himself in the head
bowhunting one year.

1490
01:13:33,209 --> 01:13:35,209
And this was
the final straw with him.

1491
01:13:35,278 --> 01:13:37,511
I took him bird hunting
one time.

1492
01:13:37,581 --> 01:13:39,881
There's birds everywhere.
He don't get nothing.

1493
01:13:39,950 --> 01:13:43,117
I got 23 daggum birds.

1494
01:13:43,186 --> 01:13:44,797
And I go,
"What's wrong with you?"

1495
01:13:44,821 --> 01:13:48,657
He goes, "I don't think
I'm throwing the dog up
high enough."

1496
01:13:48,709 --> 01:13:50,357
LARRY: What the hell?

1497
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:52,855
And we ended up getting
thrown out of the zoo
over the whole deal.

1498
01:13:52,879 --> 01:13:55,246
I mean, it was unbelievable.

1499
01:13:55,332 --> 01:13:57,599
I didn't know them penguins
could fly like that.

1500
01:13:57,667 --> 01:14:00,117
They pretty good.

1501
01:14:00,186 --> 01:14:03,088
Them people,
the anti-gunners,
irritate me.

1502
01:14:03,156 --> 01:14:04,300
But I'm gonna
tell you something.

1503
01:14:04,324 --> 01:14:05,568
I was reading
in the paper the other day,

1504
01:14:05,592 --> 01:14:06,969
there was an article
in there said,

1505
01:14:06,993 --> 01:14:12,096
"Cholesterol kills more people
in this country than guns."

1506
01:14:12,165 --> 01:14:13,725
Tell you what,
they want to save lives,

1507
01:14:13,749 --> 01:14:16,628
they ought to put
a seven-day waiting period
on Popeye's chicken.

1508
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:19,303
That's what...
I tell you right there.

1509
01:14:19,373 --> 01:14:21,105
LARRY: That's right.

1510
01:14:22,658 --> 01:14:24,258
That's right.

1511
01:14:24,327 --> 01:14:26,494
That's what's
killing folks, right there.

1512
01:14:26,562 --> 01:14:30,197
"I want a bucket of chicken."
"Fill out these forms."

1513
01:14:30,266 --> 01:14:33,718
And PETA irritates me.
I got three words for PETA,

1514
01:14:33,787 --> 01:14:36,454
chicken fried steak.

1515
01:14:36,523 --> 01:14:39,391
That's right, I like that.
I like meat.

1516
01:14:39,459 --> 01:14:42,394
I tell you,
that's good food, right there.

1517
01:14:42,462 --> 01:14:44,262
That is good food.

1518
01:14:45,782 --> 01:14:47,715
That's right.
I like eating meat.

1519
01:14:47,783 --> 01:14:49,695
I like rump roast.
You ever eat that?

1520
01:14:49,719 --> 01:14:51,881
I was eating rump roast
one time,
I said to my butcher,

1521
01:14:51,905 --> 01:14:54,505
I said,
"Why do they call rump roast
'rump roast'?"

1522
01:14:54,574 --> 01:14:57,809
He said, "Nobody'd eat it
if they named it 'cow ass.'"

1523
01:14:58,578 --> 01:15:00,511
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

1524
01:15:07,987 --> 01:15:11,272
I like getting
all my hunting stuff
at the Bass Pro Shops.

1525
01:15:11,341 --> 01:15:13,636
That's where you get all...
That's a good store,
ain't it?

1526
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:15,927
LARRY: Git-R-Done,
that's right.

1527
01:15:15,995 --> 01:15:17,394
I like that.

1528
01:15:17,464 --> 01:15:19,742
They trying to get
more women shoppers
in there now,

1529
01:15:19,766 --> 01:15:23,935
so they just opened up
a Victoria's Secret
at our Bass Pro Shop

1530
01:15:24,003 --> 01:15:26,287
a while back,
and, oh, it's nice.

1531
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:28,856
I got my wife
some crotchless waders.

1532
01:15:29,325 --> 01:15:30,524
Yeah.

1533
01:15:31,728 --> 01:15:34,696
Some beef jerky,
edible under-britches.

1534
01:15:35,865 --> 01:15:37,364
I bought so much stuff,

1535
01:15:37,433 --> 01:15:40,935
they even threw in
a French Tickler
with a scope on it.

1536
01:15:44,124 --> 01:15:47,207
I like doing
all that shopping stuff.
I enjoy it.

1537
01:15:47,276 --> 01:15:49,810
Wal-Mart's my favorite store
to go to.

1538
01:15:49,879 --> 01:15:52,897
I like the Wal-Mart.
That's right.

1539
01:15:52,966 --> 01:15:56,367
All the uptight,
political correct folks,
they don't like Wal-Mart.

1540
01:15:56,435 --> 01:15:58,435
They don't pay good wages
at Wal-Mart.

1541
01:15:58,504 --> 01:16:00,916
Well, I got an idea.
Don't work at
freaking Wal-Mart.

1542
01:16:00,940 --> 01:16:02,900
How's that sound, right there?

1543
01:16:04,443 --> 01:16:05,910
Yes, I like...
Well, you can get

1544
01:16:05,979 --> 01:16:07,879
anything you want
at the Wal-Mart.

1545
01:16:07,947 --> 01:16:12,217
They just opened up
in our Wal-Mart
two dentists' offices.

1546
01:16:12,285 --> 01:16:13,729
We did.
I ain't kidding with you.

1547
01:16:13,753 --> 01:16:14,964
Lying, crying,
I ain't shed a tear.

1548
01:16:14,988 --> 01:16:17,188
We got two dentists' offices
in there.

1549
01:16:17,257 --> 01:16:19,707
Got a regular dentist
and an express dentist

1550
01:16:19,776 --> 01:16:21,721
for folks with 15 teeth
or less in there.

1551
01:16:21,745 --> 01:16:23,244
We got the whole deal.

1552
01:16:26,265 --> 01:16:27,965
The whole deal in there.

1553
01:16:28,034 --> 01:16:30,801
You ever see
the door greeters in there?

1554
01:16:31,371 --> 01:16:32,704
Good Lord.

1555
01:16:32,772 --> 01:16:35,873
Wal-Mart been
around since, what?
1950s, 1960s?

1556
01:16:35,942 --> 01:16:40,361
The door greeter
been in there
since 1852 in there.

1557
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:42,208
And you walk in,
you know, he's like,

1558
01:16:42,232 --> 01:16:44,399
"Can I get you a buggy?"

1559
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:52,985
Boy, if you ever
robbed a Wal-Mart,

1560
01:16:53,009 --> 01:16:54,649
one thing you
ain't got to say is,

1561
01:16:54,677 --> 01:16:56,077
"Nobody move!"

1562
01:16:57,513 --> 01:17:01,482
You ever shop at the Wal-Mart
after 2:00 a.m.?

1563
01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:06,687
It's almost everybody in there
got some sort of
leg disease or something.

1564
01:17:06,756 --> 01:17:08,889
It's almost like the Wal-Mart

1565
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:12,259
turns into
the Monty Python's Ministry
of Silly Walks

1566
01:17:12,328 --> 01:17:14,345
after 2:00 a.m.

1567
01:17:14,413 --> 01:17:17,297
Good Lord, look at that guy
on aisle two over there.

1568
01:17:23,890 --> 01:17:26,306
Hell, look at that guy
by the ice cream.

1569
01:17:29,312 --> 01:17:30,756
Good Lord, let's get
the hell out of here,

1570
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:33,247
let's get the hell out of here.

1571
01:17:33,316 --> 01:17:36,400
LARRY: What's going on
at the Wal-Mart in here?

1572
01:17:36,469 --> 01:17:39,069
Hey,
did you ever say something
to somebody at the Wal-Mart,

1573
01:17:39,138 --> 01:17:41,672
and then after you said it
you thought,

1574
01:17:41,741 --> 01:17:44,208
"Shouldn't have said that."

1575
01:17:44,277 --> 01:17:47,345
I do that every trip in there.

1576
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:50,848
But there was this feller,
standing in line there.

1577
01:17:50,917 --> 01:17:55,469
Evidently busted his neck.
Had one of them halos.
You ever see that?

1578
01:17:55,538 --> 01:17:58,505
Look like a scaffold
around the head.

1579
01:17:58,574 --> 01:18:01,508
It's bolted into your temples?

1580
01:18:01,577 --> 01:18:03,811
Well, this dude go like this.

1581
01:18:06,516 --> 01:18:08,599
I go, "What's wrong with you?"
He goes,

1582
01:18:08,668 --> 01:18:11,201
"Think I lost my car key."

1583
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:14,672
I said, "You'd lose your head
if it wasn't screwed on."

1584
01:18:18,728 --> 01:18:20,094
(LAUGHING)

1585
01:18:23,132 --> 01:18:24,732
Was that wrong?

1586
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:28,435
'Cause I was really laughing
after I said that,
I got to tell you.

1587
01:18:28,504 --> 01:18:30,755
Oh, this is embarrassing.

1588
01:18:31,708 --> 01:18:33,508
I was bagging my own groceries

1589
01:18:33,559 --> 01:18:37,095
at the grocery store
the other day
'cause it was busy,

1590
01:18:37,163 --> 01:18:39,664
and some old woman come up
and patted me on the head

1591
01:18:39,733 --> 01:18:43,501
and said,
"I think it's wonderful
they hire people like you."

1592
01:18:50,110 --> 01:18:51,909
I was like, "Thank you."

1593
01:18:54,130 --> 01:18:55,496
(LARRY LAUGHS)

1594
01:18:55,548 --> 01:18:57,693
Then I wet my pants
and run her over
with my cart,

1595
01:18:57,717 --> 01:18:59,283
that's what I did.

1596
01:18:59,351 --> 01:19:01,986
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1597
01:19:04,841 --> 01:19:07,486
I'll tell you,
my favorite store
is the Home Depot.

1598
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:10,945
I like that store, right there.

1599
01:19:11,014 --> 01:19:15,499
That's a good store.
That's a big store in there.
Good Lord.

1600
01:19:15,568 --> 01:19:18,936
I'm glad they sell hot dogs
on the way in.

1601
01:19:19,004 --> 01:19:23,041
You may need
something to survive on
if you get lost in there.

1602
01:19:23,109 --> 01:19:27,528
But the worst thing
about them hot dogs
at the Home Depot

1603
01:19:27,597 --> 01:19:31,065
is they go right through you.

1604
01:19:31,134 --> 01:19:35,869
Good Lord,
I had a couple of bites
of the wiener dog in there,

1605
01:19:35,938 --> 01:19:37,716
and I had a brown snake
playing peek-a-boo

1606
01:19:37,740 --> 01:19:40,575
with my butt crack in there
at Home Depot.

1607
01:19:42,745 --> 01:19:44,161
It ain't funny.

1608
01:19:44,230 --> 01:19:47,898
I'm walking like this
through the Home Depot
in there.

1609
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:52,486
Looked like
the <i>March of the Penguins</i>
in there.

1610
01:19:52,555 --> 01:19:56,073
All I could think of
was that commercial,
"What can brown do for you?"

1611
01:19:56,141 --> 01:19:59,009
You know what I mean?
That's all I thought.

1612
01:19:59,078 --> 01:20:00,678
What can brown do for me?

1613
01:20:00,747 --> 01:20:04,865
Make me look like a jackass
at the Home Depot,
what it do for me.

1614
01:20:04,934 --> 01:20:09,370
Then I had to stand there
with my butt cheeks
squished together like this,

1615
01:20:09,439 --> 01:20:12,306
hoping nothing would
shoot out of there,

1616
01:20:12,374 --> 01:20:15,509
act like I'm looking
at something, you know.

1617
01:20:15,578 --> 01:20:18,524
You ever do that?
You be playing
a game or something?

1618
01:20:18,548 --> 01:20:21,215
It hits you
and you're like, "Oh, Lord."

1619
01:20:21,283 --> 01:20:24,012
You know that
people are like,
"Larry, get over here!"

1620
01:20:24,036 --> 01:20:27,355
"Hold on, I'm looking at this
weird bug over here.

1621
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:34,400
"I ain't never
seen a bug like this
in my whole life.

1622
01:20:35,398 --> 01:20:37,231
"Oh, that's a big bug."

1623
01:20:40,353 --> 01:20:42,664
But do me a favor,
if you ever go
to the Home Depot,

1624
01:20:42,688 --> 01:20:46,257
tell them idiots
in the plumbing department

1625
01:20:46,325 --> 01:20:48,425
to mark it better
that them toilets

1626
01:20:48,494 --> 01:20:50,862
is for display purposes only
in there.

1627
01:20:56,302 --> 01:20:57,813
Good Lord, I felt like an idiot

1628
01:20:57,837 --> 01:21:01,805
going to the toilets
on them stools in there.

1629
01:21:01,874 --> 01:21:05,309
But the good news is,
somebody's gonna get a plunger
half price, all right?

1630
01:21:05,378 --> 01:21:07,211
That's the good news.

1631
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:11,248
So there's a silver lining
in everything in this world.

1632
01:21:11,317 --> 01:21:13,628
Hey, did you ever
read that story
about the feller

1633
01:21:13,652 --> 01:21:16,504
that glued his hind end
to the toilet seat?

1634
01:21:16,572 --> 01:21:18,639
You read that?

1635
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:20,185
Some feller goes into Home Depot

1636
01:21:20,209 --> 01:21:23,977
and there were
some kids in there,
pranksters.

1637
01:21:24,046 --> 01:21:28,615
And what they done is
they put some industrial glue
on the toilet lid.

1638
01:21:28,684 --> 01:21:30,662
Well, this feller don't know,
and he walks in there

1639
01:21:30,686 --> 01:21:33,954
to take the Browns
to the Super Bowl,

1640
01:21:35,157 --> 01:21:37,035
and he sits down on this stool

1641
01:21:37,059 --> 01:21:40,661
and glues his hind
end to the toilet lid.

1642
01:21:41,463 --> 01:21:43,080
And he sued Home Depot.

1643
01:21:43,149 --> 01:21:45,911
And... But he didn't sue
'cause he got glued
to the seat,

1644
01:21:45,935 --> 01:21:49,453
he sued 'cause nobody'd
come in there quick enough
and help him.

1645
01:21:49,522 --> 01:21:53,107
Well, who in their right mind
is gonna help
somebody like that?

1646
01:21:53,175 --> 01:21:54,719
What would you do,
you go into Home Depot

1647
01:21:54,743 --> 01:21:56,372
and hear somebody in there
and see his feet.

1648
01:21:56,396 --> 01:21:58,496
Yeah, oh, yeah. Oh.

1649
01:21:58,564 --> 01:21:59,997
Oh.

1650
01:22:00,083 --> 01:22:01,182
Oh.

1651
01:22:01,984 --> 01:22:03,884
Help me!

1652
01:22:06,456 --> 01:22:08,021
Help me!

1653
01:22:09,209 --> 01:22:12,276
I can't get off.
Help me get off.

1654
01:22:14,881 --> 01:22:18,015
You ain't going in there,
either, I guarantee.

1655
01:22:20,119 --> 01:22:24,972
They ended up having to cut
the whole stool

1656
01:22:25,041 --> 01:22:28,542
out of the floor
and put him on a wood cart,

1657
01:22:29,913 --> 01:22:32,646
still sitting
in the fecal position,

1658
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:37,051
(LARRY LAUGHS)

1659
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:40,021
and wheel him out
of the Home Depot,

1660
01:22:40,089 --> 01:22:43,390
in front of God
and every shopper in there.

1661
01:22:43,459 --> 01:22:45,287
That's a pathetic one-man parade

1662
01:22:45,311 --> 01:22:47,478
right there, I'll tell you what.

1663
01:22:47,547 --> 01:22:51,398
Looked like he was crowned
king of the Home Depot poopers
in there.

1664
01:22:51,467 --> 01:22:53,828
How you all doing?
Good to see you.
How are you? Good to see you.

1665
01:22:53,852 --> 01:22:55,364
Hi, everybody.
Here's a Tootsie Roll.

1666
01:22:55,388 --> 01:22:56,598
Take some Tootsie Rolls
for the kids.

1667
01:22:56,622 --> 01:22:59,590
How are you? Good to see you.
What's going on?

1668
01:22:59,658 --> 01:23:01,508
But the thing
that irritated me was,

1669
01:23:01,577 --> 01:23:03,572
it was the Home Depot,
for Pete's sake.

1670
01:23:03,596 --> 01:23:06,341
You mean to tell me
out of that big old
25-acre store,

1671
01:23:06,365 --> 01:23:10,301
they didn't have one item
to unglue him
from a toilet seat?

1672
01:23:10,369 --> 01:23:12,269
That's pathetic.

1673
01:23:12,338 --> 01:23:14,705
And that's why I poop at Lowe's.

1674
01:23:16,842 --> 01:23:20,528
Git-R-Done.
Thanks so much, everybody.
I appreciate it.

(WHISTLING)

1676
01:23:29,505 --> 01:23:31,205
That's right, thank you.

1677
01:23:32,591 --> 01:23:33,958
All right.

1678
01:23:39,114 --> 01:23:42,282
What do you say
we bring the boys back out?

1679
01:23:44,020 --> 01:23:46,853

Mr. Jeff Foxworthy!

(WHOOPING)

1685
01:24:09,245 --> 01:24:11,011
ENGVALL:
Well, looky there, boys.

1686
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:13,297
We got... we got stool men now.

1687
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,911
You know what, it's funny.
We travel
all over the country,

1688
01:24:16,935 --> 01:24:20,020
and we all been doing this
for a number of...

1689
01:24:21,740 --> 01:24:23,657
(APPLAUSE AND CHEERING)

1690
01:24:28,130 --> 01:24:31,831
I never considered you
a spinner.

1691
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:35,269
This is the same guy,
yesterday afternoon,
we're at the Lincoln Memorial,

1692
01:24:35,338 --> 01:24:38,172
and he said,
"I had no idea
he was that big."

1693
01:24:40,509 --> 01:24:43,677
And Bill said,
"He's not even standing up."

1694
01:24:43,746 --> 01:24:46,508
You know, we travel
all over the country
doing these shows and stuff.

1695
01:24:46,532 --> 01:24:48,277
And it's funny,
being a comedian,

1696
01:24:48,301 --> 01:24:50,512
people always
come up to you, they go,
"Hey, tell me a joke."

1697
01:24:50,536 --> 01:24:52,214
Which is weird,
'cause nobody
walks up to a plumber

1698
01:24:52,238 --> 01:24:54,538
and says,
"Hey, fix my toilet."

1699
01:24:54,606 --> 01:24:55,900
So I thought
what'd be fun is,
you know,

1700
01:24:55,924 --> 01:24:58,559
do what we do every night.
Like, we finish a show.

1701
01:24:58,628 --> 01:25:00,038
And you're jacked up
from the show,

1702
01:25:00,062 --> 01:25:02,174
you can't go to bed,
so we sit around
down at the bar,

1703
01:25:02,198 --> 01:25:04,193
or Waffle House or whatever,
and we just tell jokes
to each other,

1704
01:25:04,217 --> 01:25:05,344
and I thought it might be fun

1705
01:25:05,368 --> 01:25:07,501
if we tell our favorite jokes
tonight.

1706
01:25:07,569 --> 01:25:08,680
All right.
Yeah.

1707
01:25:08,704 --> 01:25:11,155
Yeah, just joke jokes.
You guys...

1708
01:25:11,223 --> 01:25:13,223
All right.

1709
01:25:13,292 --> 01:25:16,710
Err, I got to tell you,
I'm dizzier than hell here.

1710
01:25:16,779 --> 01:25:17,979
Uh...

1711
01:25:21,985 --> 01:25:24,668
The doctor says to this feller,

1712
01:25:24,737 --> 01:25:27,805
"You got...
I got bad news
and worse news."

1713
01:25:27,874 --> 01:25:29,314
He says,
"Oh, what's the bad news?"

1714
01:25:29,375 --> 01:25:30,852
He says,
"You got 24 hours to live."

1715
01:25:30,876 --> 01:25:32,370
He says,
"What's the worse news?"

1716
01:25:32,394 --> 01:25:34,261
"I forgot to
call you yesterday."

1717
01:25:40,136 --> 01:25:43,036
All right,
I got a 24-hour-to-live one.

1718
01:25:43,105 --> 01:25:45,350
Guy gets up
in the morning, 6:00 a.m.,
goes to the doctor,

1719
01:25:45,374 --> 01:25:47,454
the doctor tells him
he's got 24 hours to live.

1720
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:49,677
I bet this is the same doctor.

1721
01:25:55,184 --> 01:25:57,435
Y'all want to sit
next to each other?

1722
01:26:03,542 --> 01:26:05,926
So, that night
when the guy's going to bed,

1723
01:26:05,995 --> 01:26:08,273
he tells his wife, he said,
"I've only got
a few hours left."

1724
01:26:08,297 --> 01:26:09,574
He said,
"I want to make love to you

1725
01:26:09,598 --> 01:26:11,678
"just as many times
as I possibly can."

1726
01:26:11,734 --> 01:26:14,151
And so they do it once,
twice, three times.

1727
01:26:14,220 --> 01:26:15,552
And then they fall asleep.

1728
01:26:15,621 --> 01:26:17,199
Well, about 4:30
in the morning,

1729
01:26:17,223 --> 01:26:18,683
the guy taps his wife
on the shoulder,

1730
01:26:18,707 --> 01:26:20,402
he goes,
"I want to make love to you
one more time."

1731
01:26:20,426 --> 01:26:23,927
And she goes,
"You know, that's easy
for you to say, Jerry.

1732
01:26:23,996 --> 01:26:26,847
"You don't have to
get up in the morning."

1733
01:26:31,554 --> 01:26:33,103
It's a different joke.

1734
01:26:36,525 --> 01:26:37,958
That's good.

1735
01:26:39,561 --> 01:26:41,540
Ronnie,
you got a joke?
Nope.

1736
01:26:41,564 --> 01:26:43,064
ENGVALL: All right.

1737
01:26:46,084 --> 01:26:50,537
His mind's like a lazy Susan.
If you'll just bear with us,

1738
01:26:50,606 --> 01:26:54,008
it'll come back around here
in just a minute.

1739
01:26:55,761 --> 01:26:58,561
This guy's taking
flying lessons.
He's talking to his buddy,

1740
01:26:58,598 --> 01:26:59,958
and he says,
"The first day in the air

1741
01:26:59,982 --> 01:27:02,327
"the instructor informs me
he's an eighth-degree
black belt

1742
01:27:02,351 --> 01:27:03,834
"and a homosexual,

1743
01:27:03,902 --> 01:27:05,864
"and if I don't succumb
to his sexual advances

1744
01:27:05,888 --> 01:27:07,465
"I have to jump
out of the plane."

1745
01:27:07,489 --> 01:27:09,200
And his buddy goes,
"Well, did you jump?"

1746
01:27:09,224 --> 01:27:11,925
And the guy goes,
"Yeah. A little at first."

1747
01:27:18,067 --> 01:27:19,482
I like that.

1748
01:27:22,805 --> 01:27:25,817
This woman goes to the doctor
and says she's got
a digestive tract problem,

1749
01:27:25,841 --> 01:27:28,036
and the doc says,
"Well, tell me about
your daily routine."

1750
01:27:28,060 --> 01:27:29,838
She says,
"Well, I get up
at 6:15 every morning,

1751
01:27:29,862 --> 01:27:32,913
"I make my family breakfast,
and at 8:15,
I have a bowel movement."

1752
01:27:32,982 --> 01:27:34,826
He goes,
"Well, let's take a x-ray
and see what the problem is."

1753
01:27:34,850 --> 01:27:37,179
So he takes an x-ray and goes,
"Well, there's the problem
right there.

1754
01:27:37,203 --> 01:27:39,063
"You got three worms in you.
We're gonna have to operate."

1755
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:41,288
First worm goes,
"Did you hear that?"

1756
01:27:41,356 --> 01:27:43,285
Second one says, "Yes, I did."
He goes,
"What are you gonna do?"

1757
01:27:43,309 --> 01:27:44,819
He goes,
"Well, I'm gonna hide
behind the heart."

1758
01:27:44,843 --> 01:27:46,554
Other worm says,
"Well, I'll hide
behind the liver."

1759
01:27:46,578 --> 01:27:48,290
And the third one says,
"I don't know
about the rest of you fellas,

1760
01:27:48,314 --> 01:27:50,381
"but I'm catching
the 8:15 out of here."

1761
01:28:05,464 --> 01:28:08,282
That's funny.
All right,
let me try one more, here.

1762
01:28:08,351 --> 01:28:09,471
All right.

1763
01:28:09,519 --> 01:28:11,485
One more, here. All right.

1764
01:28:15,691 --> 01:28:19,109
FOXWORTHY: Guess the show
is running a little long
for some of us.

1765
01:28:29,037 --> 01:28:30,198
LARRY: All right.
I didn't know it was gonna

1766
01:28:30,222 --> 01:28:32,155
take this long, sorry.

1767
01:28:32,224 --> 01:28:34,924
This feller goes
hunting with his buddy,
and he got the scope up

1768
01:28:34,993 --> 01:28:36,693
and he goes, "Oh, my Lord,

1769
01:28:36,762 --> 01:28:37,906
"I can see your house from here,

1770
01:28:37,930 --> 01:28:39,407
"and your wife's cheating on you

1771
01:28:39,431 --> 01:28:41,843
"with another feller."
He says,
"I've had it with her."

1772
01:28:41,867 --> 01:28:44,012
"Shoot her in the head
and shoot him
in the private parts."

1773
01:28:44,036 --> 01:28:46,287
And he said,
"I'll get that in one shot."

1774
01:28:54,347 --> 01:28:55,713
(WHISTLING)

1775
01:28:59,668 --> 01:29:03,169
I got to admit,
the preacher told me that
last week.

1776
01:29:05,524 --> 01:29:08,759
This guy's mother-in-law
comes to live with him.

1777
01:29:08,827 --> 01:29:10,372
And she's been living there
for about a week.

1778
01:29:10,396 --> 01:29:12,607
And he comes home one day
and she's laying
on the floor.

1779
01:29:12,631 --> 01:29:14,709
And he calls 911
and the ambulance
comes and gets her

1780
01:29:14,733 --> 01:29:16,445
and they take her
to the hospital,

1781
01:29:16,469 --> 01:29:18,230
and he's out in the waiting room

1782
01:29:18,254 --> 01:29:20,114
and the doctor
comes out after a while
and the doctor said,

1783
01:29:20,138 --> 01:29:23,474
"Well, I got some good news
and some bad news."

1784
01:29:23,542 --> 01:29:25,621
Guy said, "All right, well,
give me the bad news first."

1785
01:29:25,645 --> 01:29:29,229
He goes, "All right.
Your mother-in-law
is not gonna die."

1786
01:29:29,297 --> 01:29:31,197
He said,
"She's had a massive stroke."

1787
01:29:31,266 --> 01:29:33,645
He said, "In fact,
she's probably gonna live
20 or 30 more years."

1788
01:29:33,669 --> 01:29:36,003
He said,
"The problem is, this thing

1789
01:29:36,071 --> 01:29:38,050
"has rendered her
unable to speak."

1790
01:29:38,074 --> 01:29:39,957
He said,
"She just makes this horrible

1791
01:29:40,025 --> 01:29:42,626
"screeching noise
like a parrot now."

1792
01:29:42,695 --> 01:29:44,711
He said, "It's also

1793
01:29:44,780 --> 01:29:47,480
"disabled her
from using her arms
and she can't feed herself."

1794
01:29:47,549 --> 01:29:49,061
He said,
"For the next 20 or 30 years,

1795
01:29:49,085 --> 01:29:52,152
"you're gonna have to feed her
baby food three times a day."

1796
01:29:52,221 --> 01:29:54,232
He said,
"Also, it's made her
incontinent.

1797
01:29:54,256 --> 01:29:55,617
"You're going to have to
change her diapers

1798
01:29:55,641 --> 01:29:58,687
"and clean her up
every single day
of your life."

1799
01:29:58,711 --> 01:30:00,238
And the guy said, "Oh, my God,"

1800
01:30:00,262 --> 01:30:02,796
he said,
"What's the good news?"

1801
01:30:02,864 --> 01:30:05,984
And the doctor goes,
"I'm just kidding
with you, she died."

1802
01:30:10,622 --> 01:30:13,156
ENGVALL: That's a good one.

1803
01:30:13,225 --> 01:30:14,808
Oh, my God.

1804
01:30:19,681 --> 01:30:21,314
(WHOOPING)

1805
01:30:21,383 --> 01:30:23,833
It ain't right,
but you laughed at it.

1806
01:30:27,173 --> 01:30:29,523
Mr. White?
The, uh...

1807
01:30:29,591 --> 01:30:32,976
There's a cruise ship
and there's a magician

1808
01:30:33,045 --> 01:30:36,246
that works on the ship,
and the captain had a parrot.

1809
01:30:36,315 --> 01:30:37,793
And he liked to go
to the show every night.

1810
01:30:37,817 --> 01:30:40,195
But the parrot
understood the show,
and because he could talk,

1811
01:30:40,219 --> 01:30:42,197
he would give
away everything,
you know?

1812
01:30:42,221 --> 01:30:44,888
(SQUAWKING)
"Oh,
he's putting it in his sock."

1813
01:30:44,956 --> 01:30:47,324
"He put it up his sleeve."

1814
01:30:47,393 --> 01:30:49,693
"It's in his hat."

1815
01:30:49,761 --> 01:30:51,995
And the magician
just hated this bird,

1816
01:30:52,064 --> 01:30:53,330
and one night he just snapped

1817
01:30:53,399 --> 01:30:55,544
and he pulled out a pistol
and he shot the bird

1818
01:30:55,568 --> 01:30:59,236
and the bird ducked
and the bullet
hits a propane tank

1819
01:30:59,304 --> 01:31:03,523
and blows the cruise ship
to a billion pieces.

1820
01:31:03,592 --> 01:31:06,359
The only survivors were
the parrot and the magician,

1821
01:31:06,428 --> 01:31:10,630
and they're
floating out in the ocean
on two little pieces of wood,

1822
01:31:10,699 --> 01:31:12,182
and the parrot goes,

1823
01:31:12,251 --> 01:31:15,285
"All right, I give up,
where's the damn ship?"

1824
01:31:25,914 --> 01:31:28,982
All right, I got a ship joke.

1825
01:31:29,051 --> 01:31:32,886
Back in the 1800s,
this wooden warship
was out cruising the ocean.

1826
01:31:32,954 --> 01:31:34,332
And the guy
in the crow's nest says,

1827
01:31:34,356 --> 01:31:36,901
"Captain,
there's an enemy ship
on the horizon."

1828
01:31:36,925 --> 01:31:38,369
The Captain turns
to his assistant and says,

1829
01:31:38,393 --> 01:31:40,493
"Bring me my red shirt."

1830
01:31:42,481 --> 01:31:43,591
"All right."

1831
01:31:43,615 --> 01:31:44,759
He goes and gets his red shirt.

1832
01:31:44,783 --> 01:31:46,528
The Captain puts it on,
the battle ensues.

1833
01:31:46,552 --> 01:31:49,770
It goes all day long,
and they don't lose
one sailor.

1834
01:31:49,839 --> 01:31:52,684
About 10 minutes later
the assistant comes up
to the Captain and says,

1835
01:31:52,708 --> 01:31:54,469
"Hey, I got to
ask you something."

1836
01:31:54,493 --> 01:31:55,720
And he says,
"Before the battle started,

1837
01:31:55,744 --> 01:31:57,322
"you said,
'Bring me my red shirt.'"

1838
01:31:57,346 --> 01:31:59,023
And he goes,
"Why a red shirt?"
And he goes,

1839
01:31:59,047 --> 01:32:01,493
"Because if
I happened to be shot,
and was bleeding,

1840
01:32:01,517 --> 01:32:02,727
"the crew would not notice
the blood

1841
01:32:02,751 --> 01:32:05,218
"and they will continue
to fight on."

1842
01:32:05,286 --> 01:32:07,620
And he goes,
"Wow, that's awesome."

1843
01:32:07,689 --> 01:32:09,183
Next morning,
the guy in the crow's nest
goes,

1844
01:32:09,207 --> 01:32:11,207
"20 enemy ships
on the horizon."

1845
01:32:11,276 --> 01:32:14,210
The Captain goes,
"Bring me my brown pants."

1846
01:32:14,980 --> 01:32:16,346
(APPLAUSE)

1847
01:32:20,753 --> 01:32:23,821
All right, we got to
share this with them. Uh...

1848
01:32:25,807 --> 01:32:28,007
We... we've been
on the road for 20 years

1849
01:32:28,077 --> 01:32:29,720
just making fun of people
every night.

1850
01:32:29,744 --> 01:32:32,479
And so the producers
of the movie

1851
01:32:32,548 --> 01:32:34,548
thought it would be
really funny...

1852
01:32:34,583 --> 01:32:37,250
They contacted our wives
without our knowing it,

1853
01:32:37,319 --> 01:32:40,399
and they got them
to go through
our photo albums,

1854
01:32:40,423 --> 01:32:42,322
and to send them pictures of us

1855
01:32:42,391 --> 01:32:45,325
that we weren't necessarily
really proud of.

1856
01:32:50,065 --> 01:32:52,465
And they've got
a big Rolodex of them,

1857
01:32:52,534 --> 01:32:56,069
and so every night
they've been showing us
more and more of them.

1858
01:32:56,137 --> 01:32:58,905
So for your amusement,

1859
01:32:58,974 --> 01:33:03,193
here are some of
our real-life photos.

1860
01:33:04,313 --> 01:33:06,563
ENGVALL: Oh!
FOXWORTHY: Oh!

1861
01:33:06,631 --> 01:33:08,098
FOXWORTHY: Ha, ha!

1862
01:33:08,167 --> 01:33:09,799
Yeah, baby.

1863
01:33:09,869 --> 01:33:11,434
Yes, sir.

1864
01:33:11,503 --> 01:33:13,503
Ha! Ha, ha, ha!

1865
01:33:16,191 --> 01:33:17,857
FOXWORTHY: Woo-hoo!

1866
01:33:17,927 --> 01:33:21,411
ENGVALL: Wait a minute.
Is that... Is... is that shirt
tied in a knot?

1867
01:33:23,465 --> 01:33:28,251
Is that a shirt?
I thought it was
a prison mattress.

1868
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:32,539
LARRY: First there was
the Bee Gees,
then came the heebie-jeebies.

1869
01:33:36,145 --> 01:33:39,262
That was the look
that killed disco,
right there.

1870
01:33:40,432 --> 01:33:42,265
FOXWORTHY:
Where was this taken?

1871
01:33:42,334 --> 01:33:45,268
WHITE:
At my apartment complex.
The Bridgeview Apartments.

1872
01:33:45,337 --> 01:33:49,239
And there was no bridge
and there was no view.

1873
01:33:49,307 --> 01:33:50,652
Looks like...
No, there's a view.

1874
01:33:50,676 --> 01:33:52,476
There's a view.

1875
01:33:52,544 --> 01:33:55,712
LARRY: Looks like
a stunt double for one of
the dudes in <i>Eight is Enough.</i>

1876
01:34:00,402 --> 01:34:03,586
No, he looks like that girl
from <i>One Day at a Time.</i>

1877
01:34:09,962 --> 01:34:11,094
ENGVALL: Oh!

1878
01:34:11,163 --> 01:34:12,662
(LAUGHING) Oh, my God.

1879
01:34:20,839 --> 01:34:22,272
(WHISTLING)

1880
01:34:26,444 --> 01:34:28,912
ENGVALL: "Please,
please help me, Captain Hook."

1881
01:34:28,981 --> 01:34:30,697
"Help me, Captain Hook."

1882
01:34:30,766 --> 01:34:33,099
Dude, you gotta kill your wife.

1883
01:34:35,420 --> 01:34:38,972
This is one of Disney World's
least favorite characters.

1884
01:34:39,508 --> 01:34:40,740
Fruity.

1885
01:34:46,248 --> 01:34:49,800
FOXWORTHY:
Laugh it up, laugh it up.

1886
01:34:49,868 --> 01:34:51,788
ENGVALL: Oh!
FOXWORTHY: Oh!

1887
01:34:56,458 --> 01:34:59,025
LARRY:
That's when I was doing
Larry, the Cable Girl.

1888
01:35:01,846 --> 01:35:04,581
There is more carpet
on your toilet

1889
01:35:04,649 --> 01:35:08,418
than there is in
the rest of the house.

1890
01:35:08,487 --> 01:35:13,456
His first time ever
using an indoor toilet,
Larry lost a foot.

1891
01:35:16,495 --> 01:35:18,028
That toilet was used a lot.

1892
01:35:18,097 --> 01:35:21,631
We got a restrictor plate
on that toilet.

1893
01:35:21,700 --> 01:35:25,284
Is that two scales
in this bathroom?

1894
01:35:25,353 --> 01:35:29,756
LARRY:
My sister's pretty big,
I'll tell you that much.

1895
01:35:29,824 --> 01:35:32,559
We had to total it up.
They only went to 300 each.

1896
01:35:39,184 --> 01:35:40,550
FOXWORTHY: Ah!

1897
01:35:41,486 --> 01:35:43,152
LARRY: Here's your sign.

1898
01:35:50,579 --> 01:35:52,857
FOXWORTHY:
Is this one of the stories
that includes the phrase,

1899
01:35:52,881 --> 01:35:56,450
"And then we started
drinking tequila?"

1900
01:35:56,502 --> 01:35:59,752
What you don't know
is the pool's empty.

1901
01:35:59,821 --> 01:36:02,541
FOXWORTHY:
And probably cleaner
than Larry's toilet.

1902
01:36:04,576 --> 01:36:06,393
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

1903
01:36:10,999 --> 01:36:12,332
(WHOOPING)

1904
01:36:17,972 --> 01:36:21,174
I'm getting a divorce.

1905
01:36:21,242 --> 01:36:25,311
ENGVALL: That look has
the look of this,
"I have got to fart so bad."

1906
01:36:27,432 --> 01:36:31,151
FOXWORTHY: Looks like
the assistant manager
at the Lazy Eye Institute.

1907
01:36:31,220 --> 01:36:32,769
Can I help you?

1908
01:36:35,907 --> 01:36:38,591
That's the originator
of the website

1909
01:36:38,661 --> 01:36:41,478
upskirts.com, right there.

1910
01:36:44,866 --> 01:36:46,482
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

1911
01:36:48,737 --> 01:36:51,204
WHITE: Guess
what's under the cake?

1912
01:36:55,377 --> 01:36:57,077
FOXWORTHY: Not a whole lot.

1913
01:36:57,145 --> 01:37:01,113
Larry always found it easier
to pick up chicks
in his Pep Band T-shirt.

1914
01:37:03,452 --> 01:37:05,519
You were in the Pep Band?

1915
01:37:05,587 --> 01:37:07,120
I know. I caught flak,

1916
01:37:07,189 --> 01:37:10,123
people calling me
a sissy and a pansy,
but I loved the baton.

1917
01:37:10,192 --> 01:37:11,590
I always have.

1918
01:37:14,512 --> 01:37:16,229
ENGVALL: Oh, my God.

1919
01:37:16,298 --> 01:37:19,832
FOXWORTHY: The couch
is like something from
the Jimi Hendrix collection

1920
01:37:19,901 --> 01:37:21,918
at Sears, too.

1921
01:37:21,987 --> 01:37:26,056
That ain't no couch.
That's my sister
taking a nap right there.

1922
01:37:32,780 --> 01:37:36,049
FOXWORTHY: Oh, God.
ENGVALL: Oh, God almighty.

1923
01:37:36,118 --> 01:37:38,363
WHITE: (IN DEEP VOICE) "Son,
if you play your cards right,

1924
01:37:38,387 --> 01:37:40,653
"this Chrysler K-car
will be yours."

1925
01:37:44,993 --> 01:37:48,227
You know,
I knew I left something out
of the redneck fashion tips.

1926
01:37:48,296 --> 01:37:51,231
It was the denim
one-piece jumpsuit.

1927
01:37:58,773 --> 01:38:00,651
I remember the one thing
you didn't want to get

1928
01:38:00,675 --> 01:38:02,403
while you was wearing that
was the runs,

1929
01:38:02,427 --> 01:38:04,560
'cause you couldn't get it off.

1930
01:38:04,629 --> 01:38:08,698
Look like Shaun
Cassidy's stand-in
or something.

1931
01:38:08,767 --> 01:38:11,501
Evel Gay-nievel.

1932
01:38:15,540 --> 01:38:17,790
WHITE: She had great legs.

1933
01:38:17,859 --> 01:38:20,093
If you'd have seen the legs
on this chick,

1934
01:38:20,161 --> 01:38:23,312
you'd have gone,
"Well, you know, maybe."

1935
01:38:23,381 --> 01:38:25,247
Ah, the senior prom.

1936
01:38:28,537 --> 01:38:30,765
You know that joke I did
about the long balloons

1937
01:38:30,789 --> 01:38:33,957
four days after
the birthday party?

1938
01:38:34,026 --> 01:38:36,726
Oh, that's beautiful.

1939
01:38:36,795 --> 01:38:38,105
ENGVALL: I think it's great
the way they cut

1940
01:38:38,129 --> 01:38:40,797
the walker
out of the picture there.

1941
01:38:40,866 --> 01:38:42,760
That's my grandmother,
you better watch out.

1942
01:38:42,784 --> 01:38:44,517
Oh, I'm sorry.

1943
01:38:44,586 --> 01:38:45,852
FOXWORTHY: Uh-oh!

1944
01:38:50,158 --> 01:38:51,357
LARRY: Hey,

1945
01:38:51,426 --> 01:38:53,977
Jeff gets ready for
a two-month prison sentence

1946
01:38:54,045 --> 01:38:57,397
and practices
while sitting on a door lock.

1947
01:39:09,260 --> 01:39:12,439
WHITE: I'm actually kind of
wondering why you left
the one-piece jumpsuit out

1948
01:39:12,463 --> 01:39:14,447
of your fashion tips now.

1949
01:39:16,034 --> 01:39:18,885
Looks to me
like you got one on there,
Jeffie.

1950
01:39:21,139 --> 01:39:22,588
(ENGVALL EXCLAIMING)

1951
01:39:23,992 --> 01:39:26,810
ENGVALL:
Talk about having money.

1952
01:39:26,878 --> 01:39:28,556
All these years
you never shared with us

1953
01:39:28,580 --> 01:39:30,713
that you were
employed at Wendy's.

1954
01:39:30,782 --> 01:39:34,233
Well, you know,
you keep jobs like that
under wraps.

1955
01:39:34,302 --> 01:39:38,171
You don't want people to,
you know,
feel bad about themselves.

1956
01:39:39,624 --> 01:39:41,958
FOXWORTHY:
Who is the guy in the window?

1957
01:39:42,027 --> 01:39:44,894
WHITE: (LAUGHING)
That's the manager.

1958
01:39:44,963 --> 01:39:46,974
FOXWORTHY: He looks like,
like two minutes earlier
he said,

1959
01:39:46,998 --> 01:39:51,551
"All right,
if you're gonna fart,
go out in the parking lot."

1960
01:39:51,620 --> 01:39:55,104
I had a cheeseburger
tucked up under my hat there.

1961
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:02,778
ENGVALL: Oh.

1962
01:40:02,847 --> 01:40:06,049
Now, that... that picture
meant a lot to me.

1963
01:40:06,117 --> 01:40:09,485
LARRY: Explain that.
ENGVALL:
We were on a band trip,

1964
01:40:10,521 --> 01:40:13,406
and we went to New Orleans.

1965
01:40:13,458 --> 01:40:14,936
This is...
That's the closest you got

1966
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:17,360
to a naked woman
as a teenager, wasn't it?

1967
01:40:17,428 --> 01:40:20,263
What is today?

1968
01:40:20,332 --> 01:40:23,449
This is actually Bill
with his first tromboner.

1969
01:40:29,724 --> 01:40:32,759
What instrument
did you play, Bill?

1970
01:40:32,827 --> 01:40:35,394
Trom... Trombone.

1971
01:40:35,463 --> 01:40:37,307
FOXWORTHY: Well,
they got your mom's picture
in the window.

1972
01:40:37,331 --> 01:40:39,565
That's nice, too.

1973
01:40:39,634 --> 01:40:41,300
Put me through college.

1974
01:40:44,689 --> 01:40:46,700
WHITE:
If they would've put that
on a bottle of Scotch,

1975
01:40:46,724 --> 01:40:49,191
they'd have found me
a lot sooner.

1976
01:40:59,771 --> 01:41:04,024
FOXWORTHY: Your head and
the orange are the exact
same shape, look at that.

1977
01:41:04,092 --> 01:41:06,509
I think I was
a good-looking kid.

1978
01:41:09,130 --> 01:41:12,432
ENGVALL: "Erlene,
get back in the trailer now."

1979
01:41:17,339 --> 01:41:18,571
And people always ask,

1980
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:21,674
"Where do you come up
with them redneck jokes at?"

1981
01:41:21,743 --> 01:41:23,888
WHITE: What look were you
going for here, Jeffie?

1982
01:41:23,912 --> 01:41:27,514
We were trying to
make funny pictures
where we pulled our pants low

1983
01:41:27,582 --> 01:41:29,093
and, you know, your shirt
where it made you look like

1984
01:41:29,117 --> 01:41:31,417
you were real long-waisted
or something.

1985
01:41:31,486 --> 01:41:33,152
Good God.

1986
01:41:33,888 --> 01:41:35,321
You're an idiot.

1987
01:41:40,062 --> 01:41:42,528
Wait. I take that back.

1988
01:41:43,565 --> 01:41:45,981
You're an idiot.

1989
01:41:46,050 --> 01:41:49,536
WHITE: This girl
is not gonna smile
until the check clears.

1990
01:41:53,908 --> 01:41:58,595
WHITE: (LAUGHING)
You are having way more fun
than she is.

1991
01:41:58,680 --> 01:42:02,415
Larry celebrates the arrival
of his first blow-up doll.

1992
01:42:04,202 --> 01:42:05,802
More wine coolers!

1993
01:42:07,789 --> 01:42:09,339
Who is that?

1994
01:42:09,408 --> 01:42:11,936
LARRY: I don't know,
but she had a tattoo
on her hind end said,

1995
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:14,627
"Downgrade,
watch for other truckers."

1996
01:42:21,102 --> 01:42:22,702
LARRY: Hey.

1997
01:42:22,771 --> 01:42:25,755
Look at his shorts.
It really is a small world
after all.

1998
01:42:25,823 --> 01:42:27,423
Look at that.

1999
01:42:35,266 --> 01:42:40,019
I don't want to say nothing,
but you work
a consistent look.

2000
01:42:40,088 --> 01:42:42,205
I was trying all kind
of different stuff, you know?

2001
01:42:42,273 --> 01:42:43,490
Not... not... not really.

2002
01:42:43,558 --> 01:42:44,691
No.

2003
01:42:47,645 --> 01:42:52,031
What happens
at the family reunion
stays at the family reunion.

2004
01:42:53,334 --> 01:42:56,369
ENGVALL: "What do you mean
you want cab fare?"

2005
01:42:58,340 --> 01:43:01,708
The best part of this,
you have put a blanket

2006
01:43:01,776 --> 01:43:05,478
over to protect
the good Naugahyde
on the chair there.

2007
01:43:06,982 --> 01:43:08,125
It was a nice place.

2008
01:43:08,149 --> 01:43:10,432
LARRY: I like his Daisy Pukes.

2009
01:43:16,007 --> 01:43:18,608
No, they...
No, they doctored that up.

2010
01:43:18,676 --> 01:43:19,976
Oh, yeah.

2011
01:43:20,044 --> 01:43:24,730
Just find a good spot
and let the boys come to you.

2012
01:43:24,799 --> 01:43:27,884
ENGVALL:
Do you see what I mean
about the consistent look?

2013
01:43:27,952 --> 01:43:30,181
No, they...
no, they did that to that.
I had the...

2014
01:43:30,205 --> 01:43:32,216
What's... Oh yeah, yeah,
they did something to it.

2015
01:43:32,240 --> 01:43:33,351
They, yeah.

2016
01:43:33,375 --> 01:43:34,869
ENGVALL:
What's with the glasses?

2017
01:43:34,893 --> 01:43:38,594
WHITE: You look at that photo
and the glasses bother you?

2018
01:43:40,365 --> 01:43:43,166
What about the two sailors
in assless chaps?

2019
01:43:43,235 --> 01:43:45,568
WHITE:
Did you notice them, Bill?

2020
01:43:49,657 --> 01:43:51,274
He's got a point.

2021
01:43:54,729 --> 01:43:56,312
(ALL SCREAMING)

2022
01:44:09,611 --> 01:44:11,194
ENGVALL: Oh, my God.

2023
01:44:11,263 --> 01:44:14,897
That's when Larry was
the casting director
for the movie <i>Babe.</i>

2024
01:44:17,068 --> 01:44:19,486
It's such a cute
daggum sheep, though.

2025
01:44:19,554 --> 01:44:21,454
LARRY: Look at it.
Look at that face.

2026
01:44:21,523 --> 01:44:23,356
How could you not love that?

2027
01:44:24,175 --> 01:44:25,374
Room service,

2028
01:44:25,460 --> 01:44:27,910
I'm gonna need some beers

2029
01:44:27,979 --> 01:44:30,963
and a bag of oats.

2030
01:44:31,032 --> 01:44:33,527
You guys have been great.
God bless you.
Thank you so much.

2031
01:44:33,551 --> 01:44:34,900
Thank you very much.

2032
01:44:34,969 --> 01:44:36,853
