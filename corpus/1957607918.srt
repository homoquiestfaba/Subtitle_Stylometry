00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,600
When are they gonna come?

2
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:58,243
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up!

3
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,977
Can't believe
we're running late.

4
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,272
Why didn't you wake me?

5
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:28,356
I did wake you up.

6
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,500
You just went back to sleep.

7
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,844
You should've woken me up again!

8
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,777
You should be able
to wake yourself up.

9
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,028
I'm eight!

10
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,214
I was up baking all last night-

11
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,240
Kids, stop arguing.

12
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,491
Brie, get in the car.

13
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:46,373
Hurry up.

14
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:49,626
Buckle your seatbelt.

15
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:07,729

You look awfully spiffy today.

18
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,817
It's show and tell day.

19
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:13,919
Booger face.
Poop head!

20
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:16,446
Hey, I don't
wanna hear it today.

21

22
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,241
Wait, Dad!

23
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,159
I left my phone at the house.

24
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:22,368
Go back.

25
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,286
We're already
running late, sweetie.

26
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,412
But, Dad!

27
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:25,288
What do you need a phone for?

28
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:26,539
You'll be in school.

29
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,499
I don't wanna be
late for school.

30
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,001
I wasn't talking to you.

31
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:31,794
Don't talk to your
brother like that.

32
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,380
Can you please calm down?

33
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,464
Fine.

34
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,842
Apologize to your brother.

35
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,428
Sorry for yelling at you

36
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:41,614
even though you deserved it.

37
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:44,098
You call that an apology?

38
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,350
Brie.

39
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:46,267
Sorry.

40
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,144
Okay.

41
00:03:48,227 --> 00:03:49,437
There we go.

42
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,230
Now it's a subpar morning again.

00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:58,029

Good morning, Cardinals!

46
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,204
Don't forge we'll have
an early dismissal

47
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:07,914
today for our bake sale.

48
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,916
I hope you all
brought your bakes.

49
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,250
Winners will get to compete

50
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,086
in our annual Spring
Bake Off Challenge.

51
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:16,756
So please cheer your
fellow students on!

52
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,467
You still asleep over there?

53
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,761
No, I'm just a little nervous.

54
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,262
You got this.

55
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,472
Remember what I told you?

56
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:25,473
Yeah.

57
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:26,432
You'll be fine.

58
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,600
Okay.
Now go get 'em.

59
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:28,601
Thank you.

60
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:29,885
All right, have a great day.

61
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,980
And sell those bakes!

62
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,904
Thank you.

63
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:08,766
Ew.

64
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:09,868
Do you really think those bakes

65
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,394
will sell better than mine?

66
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,062
Those look like poop.

67
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,940
These happen to be the
most amazing brownies ever.

68
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,650
Not if they look like that.

69
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:18,860
See mine?

70
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,528
These taste as
good as they look.

71
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,464
Those look like you
bought them from the store.

72
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,488
I'm just good at baking

73
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,742
and I'm going to
sell the most today.

74
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,785
Well I hope you didn't
mistake sugar for salt.

75
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,996
I hope you don't
accidentally drop your bakes.

76
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,581
You wouldn't.

77
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:32,832
After you.

78
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,042
Don't.

79
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,418
Don't do it.

80
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,843
Hey.

81
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,845
Why were you talking to Vanessa?

82
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:48,014
She thinks she's
gonna win the bake sale.

83
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,366
Did you tell her that
it's your grandma's

84
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,808
super secret recipe?

85
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,727
No, she was too busy
calling them poop.

86
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,063
She doesn't know what
she's talking about.

87
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,564
I know.

88
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:57,482
Where's your bakes?

89
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:58,483
Ms. Melanie had us take some

90
00:05:58,566 --> 00:05:59,984
to the big fridge already.

91
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,402
You might have to go too.

92
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:02,737
Great.
What?

93
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,281
Vanessa said "I hope
you don't accidentally"

94
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:06,364
drop your bakes."

95
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,951
Oops.

96
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,578
Is everything all right, Millie?

97
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:11,829
Yeah.

98
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,957
You know, I just got a
whiff of Brie's brownies

99
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,126
and they took my breath away.

100
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,210
So good.

101
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,422
Brie, why don't you go
to the cafeteria fridge

102
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,007
where the rest of the bakes are?

103
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,383
Yes, Ms. Melanie.

104
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,803
Ms. Melanie, I need
to put mine away too.

105
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,096
All right, go ahead.

106
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,350
Anyone else have bakes
for the bake sale?

107
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,477
Sorry.

108
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,728
Wish me luck.

109
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,563
Wishing your
bakes a safe voyage.

110
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,775
Oh, why
Jody, those look fantastic.

111
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:44,153
Why don't you go with
the girls to the fridge?

112
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,280
Hey, wait for him, girls.

113
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,213
Hey, Jody, those
look really good.

114
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:05,633
Thanks.
All right, everyone.

115
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,218
Settle down.

116
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:08,678
Take out your
writing assignments

117
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,138
and send them to the front.

118
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,857
So, who taught you how to bake?

119
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,691
My dad's a baker.

120
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,025
That's so cool.

121
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,360
My dad's lame.

122
00:07:24,443 --> 00:07:25,570
Why? What's he do?

123
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:26,696
He's...

124
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:27,488
He, uh...

125
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:28,614
He's a doctor.

126
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,241
Oh, he must be really busy.

127
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:31,324
Very.

128
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,703
Oh, shoot.

129
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:34,805
I forgot my whipped
cream in my backpack.

130
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:35,829
I'll be right back.

131
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:38,875
A doctor?

132
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,127
Don't say anything, or else.

133
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,048
I'm not really gonna
drop your bakes.

134
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,967
I'm gonna beat you
fair and square.

135
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,761
Yeah, well, we'll just
have to see then, won't we?

136
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:02,899
All right, let's go.

137
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:23,668
Om.

138
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:30,842
Om.

139
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:41,979
Om.

140
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,572
Namaste, everyone.

141
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,199
Namaste.

142
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:58,746
Now, in honor of
today's bake sale,

143
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:01,540
and because we have
shorter classes,

144
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:02,792
I thought it would be fun

145
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:06,796
for each of us to draw
our favorite desserts.

146
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:07,964
Nice.

147
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:11,592
Now, here's some
paper to draw on.

148
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:13,677
Pass those back.

149
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,642
Now really think about
the feeling you get

150
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:24,647
when drawing out the
details of your desserts.

151
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,190
Okay?

152
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,274
Splendid.

153
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,434
I am not a cheese wheel!

154
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:46,979
Brie, what on earth
are you talking about?

155
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,689
Nothing.

156
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,149
What's on that piece of paper?

157
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,361
Brie, show me what's
on that paper.

158
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,366
Who drew this?

159
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,285
Brie?

160
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,496
Millie?

161
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:05,873
I don't know.

162
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:09,001
Someone tell me who drew this

163
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:12,171
or none of you will participate
in the bake sale today.

164
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,254
What?

165
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,135
One last time.

166
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:24,432
All right.

167
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:26,828
I'll tell Ms. Melanie
that each of you

168
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,270
will be waiting in the cafeteria

169
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,064
for your parents to
come and get you.

170
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,023
It was Vanessa.

171
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,861
Is this true, Vanessa?

172
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,571
Kind of.

173
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,049
You know better than to
gossip about other people,

174
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,866
especially your classmates.

175
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,161
You're going to the
principal's office.

176
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,288
And let this be a lesson
to the rest of you.

177
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:50,126
There will absolutely no
name calling of any kind.

178
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,961
In this classroom or out of it!

179
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,674
You're such a tattle tale.

180
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:57,757
Vanessa!

181
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:14,442
The aura in here is
completely tainted.

182
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:16,711
Continue working
on your drawings

183
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:17,735
until the bell rings.

184
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,955
I can't believe
you just did that.

185
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,415
Did you hear how quiet she was?

186
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:32,168
I know, but to call her out

187
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,919
in front of everybody?

188
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:34,879
Mr. Claymore
would've made us

189
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,589
sit out on the bake sale.

190
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,966
Yeah, but tell him in private

191
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:43,179
like in a note or after class.

192
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,055
Something else.

193
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,223
Oh, yeah.

194
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,641
I guess that
would've been better.

195
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,145
Oh my sweet tart.

196
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,605
There's Vanessa.

197
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,835
Do you think they'll still
let her in the bake sale?

198
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:57,943
I don't know.

199
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,320
I hope not.

200
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,155
Only nice people
should be able to do it.

201
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:03,782
Well, if she doesn't,

202
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:04,926
then we're definitely winning

203
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,952
those tickets to Cosmo Land.

204
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,036
I don't know.

205
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,915
Jody's pies smelled really good.

206
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:12,875
Maybe she'll get detention

207
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,044
for like the rest of her life.

208
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,253
Yeah, right.

209
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:18,589
Wait.

210
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:21,008
Something's wrong
with your pizza.

211
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,635
What the?

212
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:23,718
Ew.

213
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,429
It's still frozen.

214
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:26,680
Go ask for another one.

215
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:27,764
BRB.

216
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,146
I can't wait
for the bake sale today!

217
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,899
Vanessa's cupcakes
look really pretty.

218
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,071
I wanna try Jody's pies.

219
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:45,032
Yeah, we'll see who wins.

220
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,451
Patricia says she
doesn't know what happened.

221
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,410
Weird.

222
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,828
So, I just got fruit instead.

223
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,247
Well that's healthier

224
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,974
since we've been eating
a lot of sweets lately.

225
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:53,791
Yeah, yeah.

226
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,018
At least we get out early today.

227
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:58,003
I love early dismissal days.

228
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,755
I cannot wait to win this thing.

229
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:00,838
Me too.

230
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,141
Here we go.

231
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,102
We got this.

232
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,944
Millie, Vanessa's in.

233
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,280
Sugar, we don't got this.

234
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,368
All right, kids.

235
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:30,869
Who's ready for the bake sale?

236
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,539
Mm-mm-mm.

237
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,588
Whoever hired him
deserves a medal.

238
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:45,467
Whoever made him
deserves a medal.

239
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:50,638
Agreed.

240
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,649
This is your first bake sale?

241
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,109
Yeah.

242
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:04,192
We didn't do anything like
this at my other school.

243
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,238
Ms. Melanie, I'm
a little concerned

244
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,573
about the calorie consumption

245
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,074
that's gonna take
place here today.

246
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,743
Oh, yes. Me too.

247
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:11,952
It's an awful lot of sugar

248
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,203
for such small children.

249
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,039
Yeah.

250
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:16,362
I think we're ready to start.

251
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:27,384
Trying to get on
his good side, I see?

252
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:28,468
No, it's true.

253
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,723
You were one of the first
to yay the Bake Off, remember?

254
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:33,682
Shh!

255
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:34,975
I'm trying to listen.

256
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,101
All right, kids.

257
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,853
Who's ready to
start the bake sale?

258
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,149
That's the spirit I like to see.

259
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:44,276
All right, a couple
of reminders.

260
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,112
One, try not to eat all
your bakes at once, okay?

261
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,214
We don't want you
guys going home

262
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:49,823
with severe stomach pains.

263
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,867
And two, this is the big one,

264
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,535
the top four contestants

265
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,536
who sell the most bakes today

266
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,122
will have the
opportunity to compete

267
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,249
in our annual Spring
Bake Off Challenge.

268
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,356
All right, and now
I'm gonna hand it over

269
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,632
to Ms. Melanie for some
more exciting news.

270
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:09,676
Thank you, Lester.

271
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,262
Okay.

272
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:15,474
The winner of this year's
Spring Bake Off Challenge

273
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:16,392
will win the usual,

274
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:20,020
four tickets to Cosmo Land

275
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,481
and, new this year,

276
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:27,486
is $5,000 towards
your college tuition

277
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:33,158
thanks to our new
corporate sponsor DCBX.

278
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:37,162
Now DCBX is going to
be providing our school

279
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:40,082
with the necessary
tools and technology

280
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:44,169
to create more extracurricular
activities such as these.

281
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,088
$5,000?

282
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,048
Oh my great jellybeans.

283
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,300
Millie, that's enough to
pay for my culinary school.

284
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,428
Or a new computer
for The Mighty Realm.

285
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,973
They said it's
for college tuition,

286
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,391
not computer games.

287
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,977
Oh, I guess it
can go to that too.

288
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,938
All right, children.

289
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:07,276
Ready, set, sell those bakes!

290
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:47,691
How much?

291
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,942
How much do you think

292
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,527
these delicious
brownies are worth?

293
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,737
They have a perfect crust

294
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,239
and an ooey-gooey
surprise in the middle.

295
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,323
Hmm.

296
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:57,493
Three tickets.

297
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:58,786
Great!

298
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,454
But would you like
another brownie

299
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:01,997
for just two more tickets?

300
00:18:04,082 --> 00:18:05,125
That's a great deal.

301
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,209
I'll take it.

302
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,212
Thank you!

303
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,546
Thank you. Tell your friends.

304
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,675
I thought you said
just one ticket?

305
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,677
I saw an opportunity
and I took it.

306
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,554
Dang, you're good.

307
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,015
Plus my dad taught
me all about upselling.

308
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,058
Oh.

309
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,310
What's that?

310
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:29,024
Here you go.

311
00:18:29,107 --> 00:18:30,275
Thanks.

312
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:34,696
Don't forget, ♪Vanessascupcakes,
♪ bakesale, ♪bakes,

313
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,200
♪ bestcupcakesever, ♪delicious.

314
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:38,951
Got it.

315
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,536
Tag me @Vanessabakes.

316
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,498
Social media.

317
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,833
That's brilliant.

318
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,185
Why didn't we think
of that, Millie?

319
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,529
I didn't know you could do that.

320
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:50,712
Where's your phone?

321
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,797
I left it at home.

322
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,548
Where's yours?

323
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:53,631
Mine's still broken.

324
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,278
Oh, Millie, you have a customer.

325
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,178
Oh, why, hello there.

326
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,388
Hello.

327
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,389
Would you like a cookie?

328
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,557
Duh. How much is it?

329
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,786
How much do you think
this cookie is worth?

330
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,395
It is baked to perfection

331
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,730
and has ooey-gooey chocolate
chips in the middle.

332
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,357
Um, a ticket?

333
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,276
Um, how about three tickets?

334
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,359
That's too much.

335
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,153
I said one ticket.

336
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,363
Two tickets?

337
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,073
How about I take
my ticket elsewhere?

338
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:20,993
For an extra ticket you
could add chocolate on top.

339
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,079
Okay, okay, okay.

340
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,080
One ticket it is.

341
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:26,456
Now that's more like it.

342
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,667
Thank you very much.

343
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,750
Come again.

344
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,382
Whew, what a tough customer.

345
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:36,383
You handled that well.

346
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:37,467
Thanks.

347
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:38,695
We would like more
brownies, please.

348
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:39,970
Great seeing you again.

349
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:42,222
Can you give us
a group discount?

350
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:46,685
Um, I normally wouldn't do that

351
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:49,146
but I'll make an exception.

352
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:51,565
Instead of three tickets
per brownie, how about two?

353
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,697
Okay, we can do two.

354
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:05,203
These are amazing. Thanks.

355
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,538
Thank you.

356
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,373
Pleasure doing
business with you.

357
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,457
Likewise.

358
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,565
Okay, kids, bake sale is over.

359
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:34,709
Bakers, please bring
your pencil boxes

360
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,736
over to Ms. Melanie's
station right over here.

361
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,281
Oh my God, this pie is so good.

362
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:42,491
Mm-hmm.

363
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,718
Who do you think is gonna win?

364
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:44,742
Whoever made this pie.

365
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,330
Ms. Henderson!

366
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,915
Ms. Henderson.
Hi, hi.

367
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,042
Hi, did you get my text?

368
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,710
No, I didn't get anything.

369
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:54,962
Really? Oh.

370
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:58,507
I sent it at 11:00
o'clock last night.

371
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,385
Oh, well I was
probably sleeping.

372
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,845
Stuart did not understand
the math homework last night.

373
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,389
Mom!

374
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:07,808
Okay, well yes we
went over it today.

375
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:10,352
Okay, well just so you know.

376
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,435
Come on, dear.

377
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,582
You need to change your number.

378
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:15,606
I have, twice.

379
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,406
Here you go.

380
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:23,490
All right, everyone,

381
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,534
we are ready to
announce the winners

382
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:26,910
of today's bake sale.

383
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,749
In fourth place we have
Jody selling 40 tickets.

384
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,003
Fourth?

385
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:36,795
Congrats, Jody.

386
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,338
Happy you made the cut.

387
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,882
My dad is not gonna
be happy about this.

388
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:44,219
In third place we
have Millie Thompson

389
00:21:44,302 --> 00:21:45,721
selling 47 tickets.

390
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:46,513
Good job, Millie.

391
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:47,806
Way to go.

392
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,516
Yes.

393
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:53,270
In second place
we have Brie Hayes

394
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,105
selling 52 tickets.

395
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:56,273
Second place?

396
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,399
52 is a lot.

397
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:58,650
Good job, Brie.

398
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,069
And in first place we have-

399
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:04,364
Don't say Vanessa,
don't say Vanessa.

400
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,117
Vanessa Weiler
selling 53 tickets!

401
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,161
Yes!
Wow, what a close race.

402
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:09,953
We should get a recount.

403
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:10,912
What?

404
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:11,997
What did you just say?

405
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:12,789
Oh, me?

406
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:13,665
Um, nothing.

407
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:14,829
You're gonna regret that.

408
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,418
All right, today's bake sale

409
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:20,088
helped raise $936
for the school.

410
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:20,922
That's great.

411
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,299
You four will compete

412
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:24,760
in our annual Spring
Bake Off Challenge

413
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:29,097
for a chance to win four tickets
to Cosmo Land and $5,000.

414
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:33,393
All right, guys,
let's clean it up.

415
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,689
Why did I have to
say that, Millie?

416
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,066
Good question.

417
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,942
I just wanted to
win first place.

418
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,235
I mean, you got second.

419
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,612
That's still pretty good.

420
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,489
Not when Vanessa wins first.

421
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:47,449
The important thing

422
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,450
is that we made final four.

423
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,327
That was our goal.

424
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,204
That means I'm
only second as good.

425
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,163
No, that just means Vanessa

426
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:55,457
had a better marketing strategy.

427
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,375
My grandma would not be proud.

428
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:58,739
That's a terrible thing to say.

429
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,154
I'm sure she was
the sweetest lady.

430
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,548
She was actually kinda mean.

431
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:04,632
They all are.

432
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,223
I'm so sorry, girls.

433
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:12,557
Dad, it's 4:37!

434
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:13,809
I know.

435
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,602
I got distracted
with a phone call.

436
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:16,561
How'd the bake sale go?

437
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,438
We got in!
Yes!

438
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,315
I told you girls.

439
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:21,441
Why the face, Brie?

440
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:22,651
I got second.

441
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:23,902
That's great, sweetie.

442
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:26,571
Millie, did you get first then?

443
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:27,989
She got third.

444
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,075
Vanessa got first.

445
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:31,451
Vanessa Weiler?

446
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:32,369
Yes, Dad.

447
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:33,572
What other Vanessa is there?

448
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,663
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

449
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:35,914
Drop the tude, Brie.

450
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:40,085
You should be happy
you're in the Bake Off.

451
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:41,168
All right?

452
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:43,004
Come on.

453
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,589
Let's get you guys home.

454
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,466
Did your dad
really just say tude?

455
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,592
Yeah.

456
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:51,679
Hurry up, ladies.

457
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,657
Brie, wake up.

458
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,325
You got drool on
your face, toots.

459
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,494
Millie, don't call her that.

460
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:15,745
Brie, finish your homework.

461
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:18,748
How can you concentrate?

462
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,667
It's so boring.

463
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,750
I don't know.

464
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,587
I guess I just really
like the story.

465
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:27,090
Sweetie, you
have got to cheer up.

466
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:28,317
That's easy for you to say.

467
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:29,843
You're a grown-up.

468
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,362
Well if you focus
on your homework,

469
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:33,430
maybe you'll forget
about what happened.

470
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,265
Oh, can we make chocolate cake?

471
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:37,392
I said focus on homework.

472
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:39,102
Actually, can we, Dad?

473
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,395
You wanna bake more?

474
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:42,397
Yeah, like you say in your book,

475
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,357
I need to vent out my feelings.

476
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:45,734
Nice.

477
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:48,361
Okay, if it'll
make you feel better.

478
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,363
Just make sure you
finish your homework.

479
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,740
Thanks, Dad,
Thanks, Mr. H.

480
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,867
Call me if you need anything.

481
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:57,746
I'll mix the dry ingredients,

482
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:58,496
you mix the wet.

483
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,998
On it.

484
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:05,587
Mm, cocoa powder smells so good.

485
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,756
Here's the wet
ingredients for your mix.

486
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,341
I'll butter the pan.

487
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:12,969
Holy pretzel sticks, Peter!

488
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,554
You made us drop the mix!

489
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,223
It's all over the floor!

490
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:17,306
Dad!

491
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:21,853
Are you okay?

492
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:22,604
What's going on?

493
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:23,605
What did you guys do?

494
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:24,814
Us?

495
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,167
Peter scared us and
made us drop the mix.

496
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,734
Our cake is ruined.

497
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:30,111
Peter Ivan Hayes, get down here!

498
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,315
So much for baking a cake.

499
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:36,618
Peter, help your
sister clean this up.

500
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,536
Why did you do that?

501
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,871
I thought it would be funny.

502
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,623
Well, not today.

503
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,208
You get 30 minutes of time out.

504
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,291
30?
Mm-hmm.

505
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,211
It should be an hour.

506
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:47,712
Or three.

507
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:48,796
Hundred.

508
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,633
I'm watching you.

509
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,301
After you girls clean this up

510
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,552
you can bake another one

511
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:57,555
while your brother is
upstairs, all right?

512
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:00,183
I don't know why we're helping
to clean this up, but okay.

513
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,021
Here's my phone.

514
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,415
Do you think if
you had your phone today

515
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:07,816
you would've won the bake sale?

516
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,710
Millie, I don't wanna
think about that right meow.

517
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:10,734
Sorry.

518
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,279
Oh my goodness, this question
doesn't make any sense.

519
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:22,831
Yes!

520
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:23,748
I wanna go check the cake!

521
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,083
No, Peter! You stay.

522
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:26,501
We don't want you messing up

523
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:28,295
our chocolate masterpiece.

524
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:29,754
Stay, Peter.

525
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:30,838
Stay.

526
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:33,550
Stay.

527
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:34,633
Ah-ah! Sit!

528
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:37,803
Good boy.

529
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:42,017
Hey, Dad.

530
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,100
The cakes are ready.

531
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,270
Mm-hmm. Okay.

532
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:47,187
Bye.

533
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,156
All ready.

534
00:26:58,783 --> 00:26:59,659
Oh my goodness,
they look so good.

535
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,077
That looks good, girls.

536
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,746
It rose perfectly.

537
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:03,538
Hello!

538
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:05,457
Jamie, kids!

539
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,542
Can someone help me with
the groceries, please?

540
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:08,960
I'll be right there.

541
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:12,380
Oh!

542
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,673
Hi, sweetie.
Hi, honey.

543
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:14,466
Mommy!

544
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:16,843
Hello, Peter!

545
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,137
Let me help you with this.

546
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,220
Thank you.

547
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:23,016
Oh, I see you baked again.

548
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:25,560
Yeah, but Peter scared
us and made us drop it.

549
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:27,729
So we made it again.

550
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,689
Now, Peter, if you're
gonna scare someone,

551
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:32,650
at least make sure they're not
holding something important.

552
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:34,818
Got it.
Okay, good.

553
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,154
Marcy.

554
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:37,237
What?

555
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:42,243
I mean, Peter, don't
you ever do anything

556
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,912
like that again, okay?

557
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,622
Okay.
Okay.

558
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:47,582
Now go get the groceries.

559
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:48,665
Come on, buddy.

560
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:53,755
So, I'm assuming you sold
all your brownies today?

561
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:54,756
No.

562
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:55,673
No?

563
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:56,966
What do you mean no?

564
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,052
I got second place.

565
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:00,135
Second?

566
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,013
Oh.

567
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,765
Well, at least
you got in, right?

568
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,558
Yeah, but Vanessa got first.

569
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:07,811
Oh.

570
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,354
Vanessa Weiler?

571
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:10,438
Yeah.

572
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,357
Well what did she make?

573
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,608
Cupcakes.

574
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:16,027
She used social media tactics

575
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,445
to market her cupcakes.

576
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,322
Oh, wow.

577
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,449
Well why didn't you do that?

578
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:22,450
I left my phone at home.

579
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,536
And mine's still broken.

580
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:25,453
Well did she say anything

581
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:26,913
to you afterward?

582
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:27,996
Uh, no.

583
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,291
Oh, you got donuts.

584
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,751
Yes, they were on sale.

585
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:32,919
Where do these go?

586
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:34,504
In that cabinet right there.

587
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:37,966
So what place did
you get, Millie?

588
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:38,716
Third.

589
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,260
Oh, the winners get more

590
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:42,470
than just Cosmo Land tickets
if they win this year.

591
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,888
Oh yeah, what's that?

592
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,057
$5,000.

593
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,438
$5,000?

594
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:52,397
Jamie, did you hear that?

595
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,481
Yeah, I heard.

596
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,817
Brie, how come you
didn't tell me sooner?

597
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,277
She was too bust moping.

598
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,360
I was not!

599
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,739
Uh-hmm. Was too.

600
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:04,183
Well you two will have a fun
opportunity to bake together.

601
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:08,954
Who ate a donut?

602
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:12,876
Peter!

603
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:13,978
How many times do
I have to tell you

604
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,545
not before dinner?

605
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:18,006
That boy never listens.

606
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,674
Tell me about it.

607
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,712
Dad?

608
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:18,399
Dad?

609
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,901
Hmm?

610
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,904
I have some great news.

611
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,369
I got first place

612
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:30,537
in the bake sale today.

613
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:33,831
I helped to raise
a bunch of money

614
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,752
and I get to compete

615
00:30:37,835 --> 00:30:40,296
in the Spring Bake Off
Challenge for $5,000.

616
00:30:43,841 --> 00:30:45,218
That's great, sweetie.

617
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:46,301
Yeah.

618
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,888
The Bake Off is in like a month.

619
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,682
So I have to practice some more.

620
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,144
Who took you home today?

621
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,854
Maxine's mom.

622
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:02,317
Oh, good.

623
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,343
Did you finish your homework?

624
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,470
Yeah.

625
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:32,974
Perfect.

626
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,057
Are you serious?

627
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,400
There was nothing else, huh?

628
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,193
Go!
Stay close.

629
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:53,161
That chocolate
cake tastes so good.

630
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,037
Mm-hmm.

631
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,246
I'm surprised you had room

632
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,373
after having
seconds and a donut.

633
00:31:57,457 --> 00:32:00,335
I couldn't help myself.

634
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,086
Shh, guys!
I'm trying to listen.

635
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,839
Eight years old
from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania

636
00:32:04,922 --> 00:32:06,341
with an IQ of 250

637
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:09,510
which is way higher
than most Americans.

638
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,471
I can't believe how
much these kids are.

639
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:12,554
Me neither.

640
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:14,557
Millie, that is your mom.

641
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,017
Why don't you get your stuff?

642
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,202
You don't have to get up, honey.

643
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:18,436
I'll get it.

644
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,729
Oh.

645
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:21,022
Thank you, sweetheart.

646
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,273
You're welcome.

647
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:23,191
Peace out.

648
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,108
Thanks for dinner, Mrs. H.

649
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,026
You're welcome.

650
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,277
Have a nice night, Millie.

651
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,737
See you tomorrow.
Bye.

652
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,201
Hey!
Hi, Barb.

653
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,637
Thanks for keeping
Millie so late.

654
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:35,828
Of course.

655
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:36,579
I got caught up at the hospital.

656
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:37,747
It's not a problem.

657
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,540
They finished all their homework

658
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,042
and they baked
another cake today.

659
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,125
Another cake?
Mm-hmm.

660
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:43,336
Okay. Thank you.

661
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,296
What's up, Mamma?

662
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,590
Congratulations, little star.

663
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:48,383
Thanks, Mamma.
I'm so proud of you

664
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,093
for getting in.

665
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,969
Hey, did you hear
about the sponsorship?

666
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,888
Yeah, Marcy told
me on the phone.

667
00:32:53,971 --> 00:32:56,099
Yeah, $5,000.
I know.

668
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,975
Well, that is exciting.

669
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,059
Well, we'll let you go.

670
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,228
Of course.

671
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:01,020
Thanks again.
You're welcome.

672
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,122
Thanks, Mr. H.
All right.

673
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,346
Have a good night.
Take care.

674
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:11,072
And remember, kids,

675
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:15,118
be smart and keep on studying.

676
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,453
This is your hostess
with the mostest.

677
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:20,415
My name is Leonard Moe.
All right, you two.

678
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,374
It's time for bed.
And I will see you

679
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:22,667
next time.
Okay.

680
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,252
All right, go brush your teeth.

681
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,671
I'll be up in a minute.

682
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:27,754
Okay.

683
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:44,480
I'll do the dishes, honey.

684
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,775
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

685
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,299
You're being
unusually sweet today.

686
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,279
What's wrong?

687
00:34:00,037 --> 00:34:02,039
I haven't got my
advance yet from Grant.

688
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,123
What?

689
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,166
I know.

690
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,378
I've been on the phone
with him all day.

691
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:12,216
He said it's gonna be
another couple of months.

692
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,135
Another couple months?

693
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:16,053
Doesn't he know we have
a family to support?

694
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:17,138
I told him.

695
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,640
We're barley making
ends meet on my salary.

696
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:20,724
I know.

697
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:23,227
I feel terrible.

698
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,075
Maybe I should just go
back to a full time.

699
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:28,733
It's more secure.

700
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:31,276
No.

701
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:33,446
Don't do that.

702
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,783
We'll dip into our savings

703
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:39,494
and just put it back
when you get it.

704
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,374
I'm sorry, honey.

705
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,296
I waited to tell you
without the kids.

706
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:52,840
No, I'm glad you waited.

707
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,053
I just feel bad.

708
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:00,723
You're the only one
bringing home the bacon.

709
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,103
Like both food and money.

710
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:10,399
Honey, it's fine.

711
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,570
We've been in worse places.

712
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,324
I do wanna give Grant

713
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:19,200
a piece of my mind though.

714
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:21,285
I know. It's so frustrating.

715
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:30,795
She leaves
this thing everywhere.

716
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:35,299
I just hope my book sells well.

717
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:39,845
It will.

718
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:48,896
It'll be all right, honey.

719
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,482
Thank you, baby.

720
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,657
Vanessa hasn't
said anything to me today.

721
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,201
What?

722
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,828
Oh, I almost forgot she
heard you wanting a recount.

723
00:36:55,212 --> 00:36:56,547
I think she forgot.

724
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,591
I mean, she got first place.

725
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:03,638
Yeah, maybe she'll forget

726
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:04,881
all about it just like I did.

727
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:29,997
Exactly. We good.

728
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:37,338
Dip and dodge.

729
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:38,297
Here we go, come on.

730
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:39,381
Bop and weave.

731
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:42,718
All right, here we go, guys.

732
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:43,962
Dip and dodge. Dip and dodge.

733
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,616
This doesn't look
very good, Brie.

734
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,016
I know, just keep dodging.

735
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,434
Burn some calories.

736
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:51,518
Yep.

737
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:54,814
You call that a throw?

738
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:56,857
Use your tricep.

739
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,317
Get your shoulders into it.

740
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,401
Come on.

741
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:41,986
Mr. Lester said no head shots.

742
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:43,069
Oops.

743
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,991
Mr. Lester!

744
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:59,378
You can do it,
Brie. Grab a ball.

745
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:12,975
Brie, what are you...

746
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:14,435
Don't hide behind
other kids, no.

747
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:15,811
Use your instincts, come on.

748
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:33,579
I'm sorry, Mr. Winters,
but you signed the contract.

749
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:38,459
The Montgomery Ballroom was
never available on the 26th.

750
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:39,542
Yes.

751
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:41,962
As I told you before,

752
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,923
another event has booked it.

753
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:46,467
The other option is
the Hartford Ballroom.

754
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,718
It's similar in size

755
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,386
but at the opposite
end of the hotel.

756
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,390
I understand that, sir, but...

757
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,393
No.

758
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:01,815
Yes.

759
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,277
All right.

760
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:06,361
Have a good day.

761
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:14,286
Brie, you heard what
the doctor said.

762
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,163
It's just a small fracture.

763
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,915
Mom, the Bake Off is next month.

764
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:19,059
How am I supposed to practice?

765
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,961
Brie, you are a wonderful baker.

766
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:23,587
You have great instincts.

767
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,589
Instinct is what got me here.

768
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,049
What are you talking about?

769
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:29,802
Mr. Lester told me to use
my instincts in gym class

770
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:31,387
and what do I do?

771
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,389
I hide behind Jeremy
thinking I would be safe.

772
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:34,473
And what happened?

773
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:35,850
I get squashed.

774
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:38,644
I should've just taken a
dodge ball to the face.

775
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:40,062
To the face?

776
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,606
Why would you take a
dodge ball to the face?

777
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,817
Um, that was just an expression.

778
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,861
What did you mean by that?

779
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:47,944
I...

780
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:49,613
Well...

781
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:51,240
Brie Alexandra Hayes,

782
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:54,493
why would you take a
dodge ball to the face?

783
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:55,828
Vanessa was kind of attacking

784
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:57,955
me and Millie with her friends.

785
00:40:58,038 --> 00:40:58,789
What?

786
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,749
Brie, why didn't you tell me?

787
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:04,253
I can't believe this
is happening again.

788
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,380
I should call the principle.

789
00:41:06,463 --> 00:41:07,673
No.

790
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:09,258
I'm sure she didn't
mean to hit Jeremy

791
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:11,218
and have him fall on me
and then break my arm.

792
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,511
It just happened.

793
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:14,138
Brie, it is not okay

794
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:15,639
that she keeps targeting you.

795
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:16,432
It's also not okay

796
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:18,100
for you to stick up for her.

797
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:21,729
Now I know you used to be
best friends in Kindergarten

798
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:24,982
before, well, you know.

799
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:27,651
But this is just ridiculous.

800
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:28,736
I should call her father.

801
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,863
Mom, please stop!
I'm handling it.

802
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:33,574
Not if you come home with
a broken arm, you aren't.

803
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:34,885
I can't believe
you never told me

804
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,076
that Vanessa was there.

805
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:38,704
Oh.

806
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:41,373
Is that why Millie had a
bruise on her forehead?

807
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:42,333
Yep.

808
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:43,876
Dodge ball right to the face.

809
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:45,586
It was not pretty.

810
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,296
But that's why I didn't tell you

811
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:48,732
because I knew you would
make a big deal out of it.

812
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:51,175
Because it is a big deal.

813
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:54,637
Now, Brie, as your mother,
you are my responsibility

814
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,906
and right now you're
not safe in school.

815
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:58,599
I've just gotta win
the Bake Off, Mom.

816
00:41:58,682 --> 00:41:59,682
Then I can prove to her

817
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:01,352
that she's not better than me.

818
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:03,646
Please don't call her
dad or the principal

819
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:04,813
or anyone else.

820
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:06,106
It's embarrassing

821
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,733
and it's just gonna
make things worse.

822
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:13,489
You really don't
want me to do anything?

823
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,616
Just help me win
the Bake Off, please.

824
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:20,287
All right.

825
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:22,206
If that's what you want.

826
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:25,834
But, Brie, if Vanessa
threatens you,

827
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:27,127
if she makes fun of you

828
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:29,672
or so far as puts
a finger on you,

829
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:30,965
you better tell me.

830
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:31,757
You got that?

831
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,925
Yes, Mom.

832
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:34,551
Okay, good.

833
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:35,803
Thanks, Mom.

834
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,513
You're welcome.

835
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:40,599
I am gonna push you really
hard to win this thing.

836
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:41,684
Good.

837
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:43,602
This weekend,

838
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,729
it's on.

839
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:46,813
Can't wait.

840
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:56,573
Ready, and mix!

841
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:58,867
Come on, guys!

842
00:42:58,951 --> 00:42:59,951
Faster!

843
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:01,787
You call that mixing?

844
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:03,163
Let's see those spoons move!

845
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:05,666
30 seconds left.

846
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,210
Ready,

847
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:11,963
set,

848
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:14,882
go.

849
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:26,395
Yes!

850
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:27,478
16 seconds.

851
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,445
49 seconds.

852
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:35,696
Fudge Popsicle sticks!

853
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,615
Come on, ladies.
Push yourselves.

854
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:39,408
Hustle, hustle.

855
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:40,492
You can do it, let's go!

856
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:42,661
Why are we doing abs, Mrs. H?

857
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,371
Don't question me, young lady.

858
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:45,289
Yes, ma'am.

859
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:47,207
Brie, why are we doing abs?

860
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,584
I don't know.

861
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:50,002
All right, ladies.

862
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:51,420
That's enough for today.

863
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:53,005
Tomorrow we practice
taking cakes

864
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:54,465
out of the oven without a timer.

865
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:55,799
We're doing more tomorrow?

866
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:56,759
I'm exhausted.

867
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:57,968
Yes.

868
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:59,803
You know I have
to work all week.

869
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,638
Ladies, we are three weeks away.

870
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:03,223
It's time to hustle.

871
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,893
I'm gonna hustle my way to
the living room so I can relax.

872
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:06,976
Come on, Millie.

873
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,522
You're welcome.

874
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:11,846
Thanks, Mom.
Thanks, Mrs. H.

875
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,863
Your mom's hardcore.

876
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:19,365
Yeah, she's crazy.

877
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:21,241
You did really good today.

878
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:22,159
Not really.

879
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:24,578
I'm still slow at everything.

880
00:44:24,661 --> 00:44:25,496
You just need to strengthen

881
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:26,997
your good arm a little more.

882
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:28,540
That's all.

883
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:30,751
I don't think I should
be in the Bake Off anymore.

884
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:32,378
Don't say that, Brie.

885
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:34,338
Millie, my arm is broken,

886
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:36,840
I'm super slow, and you're
doing better than me.

887
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:38,050
You should just win it

888
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:39,593
and take me to
Cosmo Land with you.

889
00:44:39,676 --> 00:44:41,595
Doesn't your cast come off soon?

890
00:44:41,678 --> 00:44:42,678
Yeah.

891
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:49,937
Maybe I should go.

892
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,105
I'm sorry.

893
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:53,273
I'm just not in a
chipper mood right now.

894
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:54,942
Okay.

895
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:55,943
Can I borrow your phone?

896
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,361
I'll call my mom.

897
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:58,444
Yeah.

898
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,163
Hi, Mom. Can you
pick me up meow?

899
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:09,957
We're done practicing.

900
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,583
Yeah, we're done practicing.

901
00:45:12,709 --> 00:45:13,709
Okay.

902
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:15,838
Okay.

903
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:16,921
Okay, Mom.

904
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:18,132
Love you. Bye.

905
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:19,675
Bye.

906
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:20,926
Bye.

907
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:22,009
Okay, bye.

908
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:23,761
She'll be here in 15.

909
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:35,107
So, what did you end up
painting for art class?

910
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:37,943
What are you talking about?

911
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:40,737
We have final
paintings due on Monday.

912
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:41,821
What?

913
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:42,698
Yeah.

914
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:44,199
Remember he said it when...

915
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:45,492
You know what?

916
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:46,761
You had your doctor's
appointment that day.

917
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:47,971
Millie, why didn't
you remind me?

918
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:49,496
I thought I told you.

919
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,623
Remember on Friday Mr.
Claymore was all like,

920
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,834
"Don't forget finals
are due on Monday."

921
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:54,751
You were there.

922
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:56,503
I don't remember that.

923
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:57,421
You know what?

924
00:45:57,504 --> 00:45:58,422
You went to the bathroom.

925
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:00,090
Completely missed it.

926
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,675
What are the chances of that?

927
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:02,902
How am I supposed
to make a painting

928
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,094
with a broken arm?

929
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:05,697
You've been doing okay
with your other arm.

930
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:08,432
How am I supposed to
make a painting in one day?

931
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:09,183
I got it.

932
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,350
Just make it abstract.

933
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:11,935
You'll totally get an A.

934
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:13,312
Once I went to an art museum

935
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:15,939
and saw a painting
of a line in a square

936
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:17,524
worth millions.

937
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,026
I still don't get it.

938
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:20,152
I was with you that day.

939
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:22,070
Oh, yeah. Wasn't it fun?

940
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:23,322
Who are you?

941
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:29,077
I was trying to draw bushes

942
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:29,995
and then I gave up.

943
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:31,413
So I drew some random stripes.

944
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:33,415
It looks like Teletubbies.

945
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:36,001
I think this is
supposed to be grape juice.

946
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:39,171
Lemons, orange juice,
and strawberries.

947
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:42,048
Wow.

948
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:45,677
I see some very great
pieces of artwork

949
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:47,679
in front of me today.

950
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:49,515
Vanessa, why don't you go first?

951
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:51,892
I don't have mine
today, Mr. Claymore.

952
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:52,975
What happened?

953
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:55,020
I, uh, left it at home.

954
00:46:58,023 --> 00:46:59,274
Okay.

955
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:02,903
Well, that'll be minus
five points for tardiness.

956
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:04,196
Brie, how about you next?

957
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:08,742
Come on, don't be shy.

958
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:16,291
Um, so I did something
a little different.

959
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:22,339
When I thought about my happy
place I thought of the park.

960
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:23,422
So...

961
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:27,553
Oh my.

962
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:29,471
Brie!

963
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:30,555
I'm sorry.
No!

964
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:35,477
You really went out of your
way to express yourself here.

965
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:37,813
Yeah, I did.

966
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:39,314
Which arm did you use?

967
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:41,900
Well, I started out
with my broken arm

968
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:43,735
but that didn't go so well.

969
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:45,654
So mainly my left arm.

970
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:47,489
Very good.

971
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:51,326
I can really sense the struggle

972
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:54,746
within yourself
in this painting.

973
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:55,956
Excellent work.

974
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:58,041
A round of applause for Brie.

975
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:05,966
Campbell, you're next.

976
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:08,010
Okay, has everyone had
a chance to present?

977
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:11,096
There's the bell.

978
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:13,849
Okay, excellent work
today, everyone.

979
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:16,685
Vanessa, can I see
you for a moment?

980
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:18,812
I got it.

981
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:20,897
You sure?

982
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:21,981
Mm-hmm, yeah.

983
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:25,277
I'll see you in the cafeteria.

984
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,360
Okay.

985
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,248
Hey.

986
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:39,332
What do you want?

987
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:43,003
My mom almost
called your dad today.

988
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:44,004
Figures.

989
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:46,173
He wouldn't have
answered anyway.

990
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:47,716
Well, I just wanted to say-

991
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:48,799
I gotta go.

992
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:56,951
I got the baked
potato and sides today.

993
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:59,019
No more frozen pizza for me.

994
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:00,979
Yeah, that was pretty gross.

995
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:02,105
Yeah.

996
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:04,149
Did you talk to Vanessa?

997
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:06,234
No, she just stormed off.

998
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:07,944
Typical.

999
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:09,655
At least you tried.

1000
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:10,614
Yeah.

1001
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:12,449
Are you gonna tell your mom?

1002
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:13,532
No.

1003
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:17,287
Ugh!

1004
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:18,080
What?

1005
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:19,289
It's as hard as a rock.

1006
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:23,168
Dude.

1007
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:25,091
You have got to start
packing your own lunches.

1008
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:27,839
I know but my mom never
has time in the morning.

1009
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:29,591
Can't you pack your own?

1010
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:31,802
Oh.

1011
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:33,387
I guess that's a
better solution.

1012
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,308
So are you gonna
get another potato?

1013
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,769
No, I'll just eat the sides.

1014
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:42,312
Here you go.

1015
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,189
Oh, thanks.

1016
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:46,274
So do you know what recipe

1017
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:47,669
you're gonna use
for the Bake Off?

1018
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:49,069
I have no idea.

1019
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,821
Yeah, I think a few online.

1020
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:52,197
Ooh, what is it?

1021
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,867
I don't know if
I should tell you.

1022
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:57,077
I'm not gonna copy you.

1023
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,286
Oh yeah, I know.

1024
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:00,130
I just don't think we
should tell each other.

1025
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:02,332
But we're BFF's and we
tell each other everything.

1026
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:07,087
Yeah, but we're kinda competing
against each other, so.

1027
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,004
I was gonna tell you mine

1028
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,965
once I figured it out.

1029
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:11,258
I don't wanna know yours.

1030
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:13,218
Brie, do you even
think you telling me

1031
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:15,095
is gonna change anything?

1032
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:17,264
I mean, it could.

1033
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:19,599
You could change yours
after I tell you mine.

1034
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:20,434
Wow.

1035
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:21,226
You know what?

1036
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:22,769
You're right.

1037
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,893
We shouldn't talk about the
recipes or the Bake Off.

1038
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,315
Or at all.

1039
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:29,525
Millie!

1040
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:31,862
Millie, I didn't mean to...

1041
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:48,003
Do you know where
the donuts are?

1042
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:50,046
You ate them all, remember?

1043
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:51,256
Dang it.

1044
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:52,799
I thought I had one more left.

1045
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:56,136
What you baking now?

1046
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:57,512
A lavender vanilla cake.

1047
00:50:57,596 --> 00:50:59,097
Are you gonna make
me spill it again?

1048
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:01,183
No, not today.

1049
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:03,059
What's lavender? No chocolate?

1050
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:04,519
No, and it's a flower thingy.

1051
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:07,355
Oh.

1052
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:08,648
Can you put chocolate on it?

1053
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:10,650
I can but I won't.

1054
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:11,943
Why not?

1055
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:14,112
Because the recipe
doesn't call for it!

1056
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:16,072
Okay, sheesh.

1057
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:17,574
What's up with you today?

1058
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:18,408
Nothing!

1059
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:19,492
Now go away.

1060
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:22,203
Bye. Leave, go.

1061
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:41,640
Hey, sweet pea.

1062
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:43,141
Hey, Dad.

1063
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:45,769
Wow, that looks good.

1064
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:46,852
Thank you.

1065
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:49,231
All done.

1066
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:50,190
Do you wanna try some?

1067
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:51,983
Uh, yeah. I'll have some.

1068
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:53,860
Peter, you want some cake?

1069
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:55,821
This is a new
recipe I found online.

1070
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:56,904
Looks great.
Yes!

1071
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:00,200
Oh, that looks so good.

1072
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:02,077
Oh, wow.

1073
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,160
Okay, for you.

1074
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:05,413
Thank you.

1075
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:06,998
All right, here we go, ready?

1076
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:09,209
Uno, dos, three.

1077
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:13,337
Hmm.

1078
00:52:15,131 --> 00:52:16,216
That's um-

1079
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:18,760
Nasty. I don't like it.

1080
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:20,846
Maybe I added too much lavender?

1081
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:21,638
Yeah.

1082
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:23,056
Yeah.

1083
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:24,140
It's a little too-

1084
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:25,350
Gross.

1085
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:27,686
I was going to say floral.

1086
00:52:27,769 --> 00:52:30,105
Maybe you should
take out the lavender

1087
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:32,816
and add chocolate instead.

1088
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:35,068
But this recipe got
so many good reviews.

1089
00:52:35,151 --> 00:52:36,486
Maybe I messed it up somehow.

1090
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,071
Why don't you ask your mom?

1091
00:52:38,154 --> 00:52:39,865
Oh yeah, she
has a bunch, doesn't she?

1092
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:41,116
Yeah.

1093
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:42,301
And she'll be picking
you up tomorrow

1094
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:43,910
for your doctor's appointment.

1095
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:45,370
I thought you were taking me.

1096
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:47,414
Yeah, I have a call I
have to deal with now.

1097
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:48,915
Okay.
Wait.

1098
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:51,293
You're getting out
early tomorrow?

1099
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:52,419
Yep.

1100
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:54,045
I can't wait to get
rid of this thing.

1101
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:55,881
Well your mom
should be home soon.

1102
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:57,173
Okay.

1103
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:58,174
Here, let me help
you clean this up.

1104
00:52:58,258 --> 00:52:59,301
Give me that

1105
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:00,093
and that.

1106
00:53:00,176 --> 00:53:01,176
All right.

1107
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:04,639
Get that outta here.

1108
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:08,643
Mom?

1109
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:10,228
Yeah, sweetie?

1110
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:12,392
Do you have any recipes
I can use for the Bake Off?

1111
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:15,609
I'm sorry. What?

1112
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,110
Do you have
any recipes I can use

1113
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:18,778
to practice with
for the Bake Off?

1114
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,280
Oh yeah, of course.

1115
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:21,656
I completely forgot about those.

1116
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:25,660
I'm trying to think
where I put them though.

1117
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:31,124
Is everything okay with work?

1118
00:53:31,207 --> 00:53:32,207
Yes.

1119
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:34,377
I'm just finishing up

1120
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,171
a couple last
minute things here.

1121
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:38,089
They should be in the kitchen.

1122
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:39,173
Let's go.

1123
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:48,474
Let's see.

1124
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:59,069
Oh, here they are.

1125
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:06,743
Whoa, these
recipes are in cursive.

1126
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:09,037
Yeah, old school handwriting.

1127
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,830
I don't know how
to write in cursive.

1128
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:12,165
Are you serious?

1129
00:54:12,248 --> 00:54:13,643
They're not teaching
you that in school?

1130
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:14,334
Nope.

1131
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:15,752
Well, just my name.

1132
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:16,835
Wow.

1133
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:20,131
Oh, here.

1134
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:22,300
This one's my favorite.

1135
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:25,011
Black forest gateo...

1136
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:27,013
Black forest gateaux.

1137
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:29,349
It has chocolate
and cherries and...

1138
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:31,559
Oh, it is so good.

1139
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:33,061
Thank you.

1140
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:34,789
This one will definitely
impress the judges.

1141
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:35,689
Thanks, Mom.

1142
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,315
Can we practice this tomorrow?

1143
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:39,317
Yeah, sure.
That'll be perfect.

1144
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:41,611
You wanna invite Millie
along to practice too?

1145
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:44,447
Um, we're not really
talking right now.

1146
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:45,365
Sweetie, why?

1147
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:46,592
Because I wouldn't tell her

1148
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:48,284
what I was making
for the Bake Off.

1149
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:50,203
Well that seems unfair of her

1150
00:54:50,286 --> 00:54:52,080
and for the rest of the
kids in the Bake Off.

1151
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:52,998
That's what I was thinking.

1152
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:54,499
Well did you tell her that?

1153
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:56,501
No, she just stormed off.

1154
00:54:56,584 --> 00:54:57,687
Well, I'm sure she'll understand

1155
00:54:57,711 --> 00:54:59,504
as soon as you talk to her.

1156
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:00,587
Yeah.

1157
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:05,010
This recipe looks
really hard, Mom.

1158
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:06,386
I know you can do it.

1159
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:09,596
I hope so.

1160
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:13,768
Well, let's leave these here.

1161
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:14,936
It's getting late.

1162
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:17,022
And let's get ready for bed.

1163
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:18,398
Okay. Thanks, Mamma.

1164
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:19,481
Oh, you're welcome.

1165
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:41,503
9:37?

1166
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:44,090
Dad!

1167
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,174
Mom!

1168
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:50,597
Dad!

1169
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:51,556
Why didn't you wake me?

1170
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:52,432
I'm gonna be late for school!

1171
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:54,309
Sweetie, everything is fine.

1172
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:56,519
You don't have school today.

1173
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:57,854
What? How come?

1174
00:55:57,937 --> 00:55:59,606
Well, there was a fire

1175
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:00,607
in your school last night.

1176
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:01,941
A fire?

1177
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:02,692
What happened?

1178
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:03,610
Did anyone get hurt?

1179
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:05,528
Thankfully nobody got hurt.

1180
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:06,863
But apparently the ovens

1181
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:09,157
never fully shut off like
they were supposed to

1182
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,658
and, well, exploded
in the kitchen.

1183
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:11,826
Exploded?

1184
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,536
Luckily the kitchen
has metal doors

1185
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,747
so the fire was
somewhat contained.

1186
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:18,041
I read the rest of
the cafeteria is fine.

1187
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:20,376
What? Oh my gosh.

1188
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,604
Dad, is there still
gonna be a Bake Off?

1189
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:24,589
Sweetie, everything
will be fine.

1190
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:26,674
They're probably figuring
that out right now.

1191
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:29,135
What are we gonna do?

1192
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,762
Why aren't we in
the faculty lounge?

1193
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:33,515
Because the aura in
here is much better

1194
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:34,724
than in that hole.

1195
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:36,810
Okay.

1196
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:38,645
It does smell
really good in here.

1197
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:40,146
Thank you, Lester.

1198
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:44,567
That's my calm mind and
confidence boost essential oils.

1199
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:46,778
You know it's really good
for muscle tension too.

1200
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:48,404
You know, I've heard of those

1201
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:49,590
but I'm not sure I
could find a diffuser

1202
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:51,074
big enough for the entire gym.

1203
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:53,576
I could help you
look for one in stores.

1204
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:55,096
That store Big Buys
might have something.

1205
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,497
Oh, don't be silly, Lester.

1206
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,290
You can borrow my
essential oils.

1207
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:00,792
That way you can try them out.

1208
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:02,710
Okay, thanks, guys.
Mm-hmm!

1209
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:04,379
All right, everyone.

1210
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:05,713
Let's try and focus here.

1211
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:10,802
Ms. Henderson, what did the
fireman say the damage was?

1212
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:16,141
He said an estimated $20,000.

1213
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:17,851
What?
Oh my Lanta.

1214
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:22,522
Ms. Silvera, did you
see how much contingency

1215
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:23,773
we have in our budget?

1216
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:27,318
Yes, we ran out of
contingency two months ago.

1217
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:28,736
How is that possible?

1218
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,005
The bathroom
leak on the third floor

1219
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:32,532
really took a hit to
our budget this year.

1220
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:35,410
Well, what about DCBX?

1221
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:38,204
They're the ones sponsoring
the Bake Off prize money.

1222
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:39,968
Why not ask them for
help with the kitchen?

1223
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:43,418
Well, I'm afraid
even if they did help,

1224
00:57:43,501 --> 00:57:46,671
the kitchen would not be
done before next week.

1225
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:47,898
The parents are gonna have a fit

1226
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:48,798
if we don't have this Bake Off.

1227
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:50,300
Well, I know.

1228
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:51,593
I'm not...

1229
00:57:51,676 --> 00:57:52,719
No.

1230
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:54,162
What if we have
it in the summer?

1231
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:56,264
Oh wait, I got it!

1232
00:57:57,724 --> 00:58:00,310
Why don't we just do a no
bake Bake Off Challenge.

1233
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:02,394
Hmm.

1234
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:06,691
Bake, no bake Bake Off.

1235
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:09,235
I guess that could work.

1236
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:10,403
I mean, it can.

1237
00:58:10,486 --> 00:58:12,447
I make no bake
bakes all the time.

1238
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:13,239
What?

1239
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:14,949
You bake too?

1240
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:18,453
Yeah, on my days
off with my nieces.

1241
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:19,704
Wow.

1242
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:22,207
That's the sweetest
thing I've ever heard.

1243
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:24,751
Lester, I think you just saved

1244
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:26,127
the Bake Off Challenge.

1245
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:31,007
I think I'm in love
with this new plan.

1246
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:31,758
Yeah, me too.

1247
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:33,509
What do we do next?

1248
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:37,347
Well, we'll announce it
first thing tomorrow morning.

1249
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:38,640
In the meantime,

1250
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:41,017
let's figure out what
changes we have to make.

1251
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:45,479
All right.

1252
00:58:46,564 --> 00:58:48,358
Oh, you're getting some paper.

1253
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:50,026
Oh, Lester, you
didn't come prepared.

1254
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:51,194
There you go.

1255
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:52,277
Thank you.

1256
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:02,622
Hey!

1257
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:04,082
You got your cast off.

1258
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:05,250
Yeah.

1259
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:06,653
Where do you think you're going?

1260
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:07,835
To class.

1261
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:10,046
Your arm looks so much better.

1262
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:11,129
Yeah.

1263
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:19,681
Can't wait to play
dodge ball with you again.

1264
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:21,391
Maybe we'll get your other arm.

1265
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:24,227
Hey! Come on, let's go.

1266
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:30,811
I'm so mad about the fire.

1267
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:36,239
All right, everyone.

1268
00:59:36,322 --> 00:59:39,284
Settle down, settle down.

1269
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:42,370
I have some news this
morning to pass onto you.

1270
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:45,099
As you all know, we
had a bit of a fire

1271
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:49,127
in the cafeteria kitchen
a couple of nights ago.

1272
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:52,755
Luckily, the damage
was contained.

1273
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:55,508
However, our ovens
for the Bake Off

1274
00:59:55,591 --> 00:59:57,010
are completely destroyed.

1275
00:59:58,219 --> 01:00:00,179
So, who are my
contestants, please?

1276
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:01,472
Raise your hands.

1277
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:04,684
You four will now compete

1278
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:07,937
in a No Bake Bake Off Challenge.

1279
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:12,358
Like last year, the first two
challenges will be a surprise

1280
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:15,361
and you'll have 15
minutes to complete it.

1281
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:18,281
As for the third
and final challenge,

1282
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:19,741
unlike last year,

1283
01:00:19,824 --> 01:00:23,036
instead of you baking a cake
for the ultimate showdown,

1284
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,579
you will now be making

1285
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:29,125
an Ultimate Spring No Bake
Cheesecake, all right?

1286
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:33,713
Don't forget next Friday we
will have early dismissal.

1287
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:37,633
Now any students who are not
participating in the Bake Off

1288
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:39,927
please be sure to be there

1289
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:42,305
to cheer your peers on.

1290
01:00:42,388 --> 01:00:44,182
Does anybody have any questions?

1291
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:47,352
Oh, Vanessa.

1292
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:49,562
We're still having it
in the cafeteria, right?

1293
01:00:49,645 --> 01:00:50,355
Yes.

1294
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:51,731
And in the meantime,

1295
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:54,484
we'll be having our lunches
here in the classroom.

1296
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:55,902
Okay.

1297
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:58,071
All right, now if everyone
will open their book

1298
01:00:58,154 --> 01:01:01,074
to page 133, we'll read the poem

1299
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:03,993
"A Chance I Have"
by Kate Miller.

1300
01:01:13,252 --> 01:01:14,962
All right, go ahead.

1301
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:16,839
Yes, Ms. Melanie.

1302
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:18,966
"A Chance I Have"
by Kate Miller.

1303
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:21,302
Chances come and go.

1304
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:24,389
Some we take, some we miss.

1305
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:27,058
I'm sorry.

1306
01:01:27,141 --> 01:01:28,541
I didn't mean to
make you mad at me.

1307
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:31,854
No, I'm sorry.

1308
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:33,272
I was being a ding-dong.

1309
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:38,207
Well now I really
don't know what to do.

1310
01:01:38,277 --> 01:01:39,277
A No Bake Bake Off?

1311
01:01:43,324 --> 01:01:44,909
I know, right?

1312
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:47,120
Well, don't tell me.

1313
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:48,203
I don't wanna know.

1314
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:53,519
And the chance
I have each and every day.

1315
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:55,503
A chance I often miss

1316
01:01:55,586 --> 01:01:57,880
and a chance I often run from.

1317
01:01:57,964 --> 01:01:59,674
Brie, next verse.

1318
01:02:01,634 --> 01:02:02,677
And the chance I have

1319
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:03,928
is the chance I have

1320
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:05,731
that makes life worth
taking another breath.

1321
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:08,683
Millie, next verse.

1322
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:21,279
Get some rest, sweet pea.

1323
01:02:21,362 --> 01:02:22,798
You're gonna do
great tomorrow, honey.

1324
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:23,990
We got all the ingredients

1325
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:25,700
for the cheesecake, right, Mom?

1326
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:27,869
Yes, I checked five times.

1327
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:28,870
Okay.

1328
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:30,830
How's your arm doing?

1329
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:31,706
It's a little stiff

1330
01:02:31,789 --> 01:02:33,916
but it's so, so much better.

1331
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,918
Well no matter what
happens tomorrow,

1332
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:37,044
we're proud of you.

1333
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:38,379
Thanks, Dad. Goodnight.

1334
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:40,590
Goodnight, baby.

1335
01:02:40,673 --> 01:02:41,673
Goodnight, sweetie.

1336
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:44,176
Goodnight, Mamma.

1337
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:02,320
Dad! You're home so late.

1338
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:04,946
I know.

1339
01:03:04,989 --> 01:03:06,449
Crazy day today.

1340
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:09,660
I still need
to go to the grocery store.

1341
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:11,162
We'll go tomorrow.

1342
01:03:11,245 --> 01:03:13,414
Dad, I can't tomorrow.

1343
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:15,666
Hello? The Bake Off.

1344
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:17,835
That's tomorrow?

1345
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:20,963
Yeah, I told you like 100 times.

1346
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:24,050
Hey, don't take that
tone with me, young lady.

1347
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:25,218
Did you forget?

1348
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:27,469
No.

1349
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:30,181
Can we please just go now?

1350
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:33,350
All right.

1351
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:35,936
Let's go.

1352
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:05,109
Wow.

1353
01:05:05,192 --> 01:05:07,486
There are a lot of people here.

1354
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:08,321
Oh hey, there's Barb.

1355
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:09,238
Hey, Barb, come here.

1356
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:10,364
We saved you a seat.

1357
01:05:10,448 --> 01:05:11,448
Okay, great.

1358
01:05:14,827 --> 01:05:15,947
I don't believe we've met.

1359
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:16,704
I'm Jamie.

1360
01:05:16,787 --> 01:05:17,705
Hi, I'm Don Fisher.

1361
01:05:17,788 --> 01:05:18,956
Nice to meet you.

1362
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:20,082
Samantha.

1363
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:21,226
How are you doing, Samantha?

1364
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:22,394
Who are you all
rooting for today?

1365
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:24,170
Oh, we're rooting for Jody.

1366
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:26,130
He's the only boy in
the contest this year.

1367
01:05:26,213 --> 01:05:28,132
Oh, nice, nice.

1368
01:05:28,215 --> 01:05:29,425
Jody?

1369
01:05:29,508 --> 01:05:31,052
Isn't that a girl's name?

1370
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:32,762
Jody is short for Joseph.

1371
01:05:32,845 --> 01:05:33,845
Kinda like Jamie.

1372
01:05:37,933 --> 01:05:39,435
Right, right.

1373
01:05:39,518 --> 01:05:42,396
Marcy, meet Jody's parents.

1374
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,857
Oh, hi. Marcy Hayes.

1375
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:45,940
Hi, Samantha.

1376
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:49,028
Our daughter is Brie.

1377
01:05:49,111 --> 01:05:51,072
That's wonderful.

1378
01:05:51,155 --> 01:05:53,741
Jody has been
practicing nonstop.

1379
01:05:53,824 --> 01:05:54,909
Right, right.

1380
01:06:00,706 --> 01:06:02,124
Have you seen Eugene?

1381
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:03,208
Who?

1382
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:04,168
Vanessa's dad.

1383
01:06:04,251 --> 01:06:05,251
Oh, oh.

1384
01:06:07,171 --> 01:06:08,171
No.

1385
01:06:09,256 --> 01:06:11,050
Are you gonna say
something to him?

1386
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:11,842
No.

1387
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:13,135
But he should be here.

1388
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:15,137
All the other parents are.

1389
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:16,221
I know.

1390
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,000
Hello, Ms. Melanie.

1391
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:46,001
Oh, hello, Daniel.

1392
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:48,212
How are you? So good to see you.

1393
01:06:48,295 --> 01:06:49,880
I see you brought the big prize.

1394
01:06:49,964 --> 01:06:51,090
Yes, of course.

1395
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:52,883
This must be your wife, Betty.

1396
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:54,593
Hi, so nice to meet you.

1397
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:55,511
Thank you for having us.

1398
01:06:55,594 --> 01:06:56,512
The pleasure's all mine.

1399
01:06:56,595 --> 01:06:59,515
Your seats are
reserved in the front.

1400
01:06:59,598 --> 01:07:00,766
Thank you.

1401
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,523
Hello, everyone.

1402
01:07:07,606 --> 01:07:09,400
We will now get started.

1403
01:07:09,483 --> 01:07:12,361
The winner of the Spring
No Bake Bake Off Challenge

1404
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:14,905
will receive four
tickets to Cosmo Land

1405
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:16,282
and $5,000

1406
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:19,720
thanks to the wonderful
Daniel and Betty Kauffman

1407
01:07:19,744 --> 01:07:20,786
over at DCBX.

1408
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:31,005
I will now introduce the bakers.

1409
01:07:31,088 --> 01:07:34,091
First up we have Jody Fisher.

1410
01:07:35,050 --> 01:07:36,469
Look at that face.

1411
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:37,552
Beautiful.

1412
01:07:42,933 --> 01:07:45,019
Next we have Brie Hayes.

1413
01:07:45,102 --> 01:07:46,937
Brie, Brie, Brie, Brie,

1414
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:48,021
Brie, Brie, Brie!

1415
01:07:49,774 --> 01:07:51,192
Millie Thompson.

1416
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:56,155
That's my baby!

1417
01:07:56,238 --> 01:07:57,238
Woo!

1418
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:00,241
Hi, Mom.

1419
01:08:02,244 --> 01:08:04,246
And lastly, Vanessa Weiler.

1420
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:15,966
All right, I will now
move on to the judges.

1421
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:18,552
First up we have Mr. Claymore.

1422
01:08:24,016 --> 01:08:25,016
Ms. Silvera.

1423
01:08:29,313 --> 01:08:30,356
And Ms. Henderson.

1424
01:08:36,862 --> 01:08:38,405
They will be judging
the contestants

1425
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:40,866
on presentation, creativity,

1426
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:42,785
and of course taste.

1427
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:45,830
All right, the game plan.

1428
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:50,709
Just take care of her, okay?

1429
01:08:53,337 --> 01:08:56,799
There will be three No
Bake, Bake Off Challenges.

1430
01:08:56,882 --> 01:08:58,217
For the first two rounds

1431
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:00,094
the bakers will have 15 minutes

1432
01:09:00,177 --> 01:09:01,512
to complete the challenge.

1433
01:09:01,595 --> 01:09:03,139
For the third and final round,

1434
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:05,850
they will have 45 minutes.

1435
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:08,435
I, Lester, will be
tracking the time.

1436
01:09:08,519 --> 01:09:10,396
Once I say time, bakers,
hands off your bakes.

1437
01:09:12,356 --> 01:09:13,356
Got that?

1438
01:09:20,364 --> 01:09:23,158
Let the challenge begin!

1439
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:32,668
Get the table.

1440
01:09:32,751 --> 01:09:34,170
Get the table.

1441
01:09:42,219 --> 01:09:43,219
Okay.

1442
01:09:44,471 --> 01:09:46,098
Contestants, please step forward

1443
01:09:46,181 --> 01:09:47,516
with your baskets.

1444
01:09:50,352 --> 01:09:51,770
Your first challenge

1445
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:56,192
is the No Bake Rice
Crispy Treat Spectacular.

1446
01:09:56,275 --> 01:09:59,445
Now you may only use these
ingredients here at the table.

1447
01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:02,239
Lester, the time.

1448
01:10:05,576 --> 01:10:08,579
Ready, set,

1449
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:11,040
bake!

1450
01:10:18,964 --> 01:10:21,675
Yeah, Brie!
You got this, Jody.

1451
01:10:35,439 --> 01:10:37,399
This is so exciting.

1452
01:10:49,328 --> 01:10:50,328
Where is he?

1453
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:57,294
Five minutes left, bakers.

1454
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:23,696
20 seconds left.

1455
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:25,698
Remember, presentation
is important.

1456
01:11:32,579 --> 01:11:33,579
Five, four,

1457
01:11:34,748 --> 01:11:37,918
three, two, one.

1458
01:11:38,002 --> 01:11:38,919
And that's time.

1459
01:11:39,003 --> 01:11:40,003
Hands off your bakes.

1460
01:11:51,348 --> 01:11:52,348
That was crazy.

1461
01:11:54,768 --> 01:11:58,397
I can't wait to see
what happens here.

1462
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:02,526
You know, we should really
get two of these next time.

1463
01:12:02,609 --> 01:12:03,609
I agree.

1464
01:12:04,778 --> 01:12:08,032
Contestants, please step
forward with your bakes

1465
01:12:08,115 --> 01:12:09,783
to the judging table.

1466
01:12:55,704 --> 01:12:57,915
I'm just gonna write yaas.

1467
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:05,547
Millie did great
with the sprinkles,

1468
01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:07,800
and the jelly beans are a
nice touch too over here.

1469
01:13:12,554 --> 01:13:16,058
I wonder how they're gonna-
I don't know.

1470
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:22,523
It's really intense.

1471
01:13:24,316 --> 01:13:25,400
Oh my goodness.

1472
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:28,362
What a wonderful
suspenseful first round.

1473
01:13:28,445 --> 01:13:30,447
We will now take
a 15 minute break

1474
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:32,157
to set up for the next round.

1475
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:33,283
Thank you.

1476
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:37,663
Hi, Jody.

1477
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:38,789
Hello.

1478
01:13:38,872 --> 01:13:39,748
That looked amazing.
It really did.

1479
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:40,999
It was like incredible.

1480
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:42,643
Where did you learn
to bake that good?

1481
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:44,169
My dad's a baker.

1482
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:46,505
Wow.
That's so cool.

1483
01:13:46,588 --> 01:13:48,590
Thanks.
The way you stirred

1484
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:50,884
the batter with your
wrist was perfect.

1485
01:13:50,968 --> 01:13:52,427
The technique is on point.

1486
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:53,429
It was.

1487
01:13:53,512 --> 01:13:54,512
Thank you.

1488
01:13:56,723 --> 01:13:58,058
You did great, Millie bear.

1489
01:13:58,142 --> 01:13:59,143
So proud of you!

1490
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:03,522
Thanks, Mamma.

1491
01:14:05,899 --> 01:14:07,401
You did so great, honey.

1492
01:14:07,484 --> 01:14:08,610
Thanks, Mom.

1493
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:10,696
That was intense.
Yeah.

1494
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:12,656
Can I have some of
the stuff you made?

1495
01:14:12,739 --> 01:14:15,534
Um, I'm pretty sure they're
cleaning up right now.

1496
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:16,618
Dang it.

1497
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:17,828
Sorry.

1498
01:14:17,911 --> 01:14:19,271
You gotta wait
your turn, mister.

1499
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:23,125
Um, I'll be right back.

1500
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:25,502
Okay.

1501
01:14:56,658 --> 01:14:59,328
Vanessa, are you okay?

1502
01:14:59,411 --> 01:15:00,411
Go away, Brie.

1503
01:15:01,663 --> 01:15:03,373
I'm sorry your dad isn't here.

1504
01:15:06,543 --> 01:15:07,628
I just wanted to tell you

1505
01:15:07,711 --> 01:15:09,379
that if you ever need anything

1506
01:15:09,463 --> 01:15:10,964
you can count on me,

1507
01:15:11,048 --> 01:15:13,467
even if you make my life
miserable sometimes.

1508
01:15:13,550 --> 01:15:15,761
Brie, I don't wanna talk to you.

1509
01:15:15,844 --> 01:15:17,512
Now go away!

1510
01:15:17,596 --> 01:15:18,972
You know what?

1511
01:15:19,056 --> 01:15:20,158
Maybe if you weren't such
a brat all of the time,

1512
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:23,143
your friends would be in
here trying to help you.

1513
01:15:23,227 --> 01:15:25,729
Instead, they're out
there talking to Jody.

1514
01:15:25,812 --> 01:15:27,207
You don't know what
you're talking about.

1515
01:15:27,231 --> 01:15:29,483
I'm just trying to help.

1516
01:15:29,566 --> 01:15:30,692
I don't need your help.

1517
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:32,486
Now go away or I'll-

1518
01:15:32,569 --> 01:15:33,737
You'll what?

1519
01:15:33,820 --> 01:15:36,657
Call me names, embarrass
me in front of everyone,

1520
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:38,367
break my arm?

1521
01:15:38,450 --> 01:15:40,869
Oh wait, you've already
done all those things.

1522
01:15:42,162 --> 01:15:43,997
I don't even know why
I try with you anymore.

1523
01:16:02,641 --> 01:16:05,060
We will now start
the second challenge.

1524
01:16:05,143 --> 01:16:07,938
One of my favorite
desserts growing up,

1525
01:16:08,021 --> 01:16:12,901
this is my Auntie May's
marvelous no bake banana pudding.

1526
01:16:14,486 --> 01:16:18,407
You will have exactly 15 minutes
to complete this challenge.

1527
01:16:18,490 --> 01:16:20,033
Lester, are you ready?

1528
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:21,909
I was born for this.

1529
01:16:22,786 --> 01:16:23,787
Yeah, you were.

1530
01:16:25,789 --> 01:16:28,792
Ready, set,

1531
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:30,085
bake!

1532
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:52,774
Oh my gosh.

1533
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:54,443
There's a lot of
mixing in this one.

1534
01:16:54,526 --> 01:16:55,986
Focus, Brie. 15 minutes.

1535
01:16:57,321 --> 01:16:58,488
Come on, Brie, hustle.

1536
01:17:07,497 --> 01:17:08,206
Let's go, Jody.

1537
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:09,290
Mix it all together.

1538
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:10,417
This is a tough one.

1539
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:12,169
I know. I am so nervous.

1540
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:18,008
How much time is left?

1541
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:22,137
Three minutes,
bakers. Three minutes.

1542
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:28,412
Oh no.

1543
01:18:28,495 --> 01:18:30,372
Brie, Vanessa just left.

1544
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:33,875
Whatever.

1545
01:18:37,879 --> 01:18:39,631
I hope she's okay.

1546
01:18:40,882 --> 01:18:45,804
And that's five,
four, three, two, one.

1547
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:47,555
Time! Hands up, bakers.

1548
01:18:50,934 --> 01:18:53,645
It's getting hot in here, wow.

1549
01:18:59,359 --> 01:19:00,962
Bakers, please bring
your banana puddings

1550
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:01,986
up to the judging table.

1551
01:19:22,215 --> 01:19:24,134
Yeah, I think that
one looks the best.

1552
01:19:24,217 --> 01:19:26,845
I mean, that one's missing
cookies altogether.

1553
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:27,971
Oh yeah, that's Vanessa.

1554
01:19:28,054 --> 01:19:30,015
We're still gonna have
to deduct the points.

1555
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:31,600
I think she tried.

1556
01:19:31,683 --> 01:19:32,952
Yeah, but I'm
still gonna have to

1557
01:19:32,976 --> 01:19:35,187
give her zero points
for presentation.

1558
01:19:41,401 --> 01:19:42,401
Mm-mm.

1559
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:45,070
Yes, Jody!

1560
01:19:50,702 --> 01:19:51,828
Oh my god.

1561
01:19:51,912 --> 01:19:53,497
That is the best
pudding I've ever had.

1562
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:54,873
But we can't show them.

1563
01:19:59,002 --> 01:19:59,836
Why am I not floating up

1564
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:01,087
in an angel cloud right now?

1565
01:20:01,171 --> 01:20:02,171
This is amazing.

1566
01:20:06,384 --> 01:20:11,264
This is so good.
It is so good.

1567
01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:12,348
Mm.

1568
01:20:13,308 --> 01:20:14,308
Okay.

1569
01:20:19,773 --> 01:20:20,607
Yep.
Okay.

1570
01:20:20,690 --> 01:20:21,690
You guys ready?

1571
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:29,824
How's your arm feeling?

1572
01:20:29,908 --> 01:20:31,034
It hurts a bit.

1573
01:20:32,285 --> 01:20:34,079
I can't believe she
just walked out.

1574
01:20:34,162 --> 01:20:37,082
Yeah, her dad isn't here.

1575
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:39,083
I know.

1576
01:20:43,421 --> 01:20:45,382
Are you okay?

1577
01:20:45,465 --> 01:20:46,465
Yeah.

1578
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:48,510
Where are your parents?

1579
01:20:48,593 --> 01:20:49,844
I don't know where my dad is.

1580
01:20:49,928 --> 01:20:50,928
What about your mom?

1581
01:20:52,931 --> 01:20:54,349
I don't have one anymore.

1582
01:20:56,017 --> 01:20:58,436
Oh my gosh, I am so sorry.

1583
01:20:58,520 --> 01:20:59,938
I had no idea.

1584
01:21:00,021 --> 01:21:01,021
It's fine.

1585
01:21:04,317 --> 01:21:05,026
Vanessa.

1586
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:06,110
Dad!

1587
01:21:07,404 --> 01:21:09,281
I'm so sorry, Vanessa.

1588
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:10,699
I tried leaving early

1589
01:21:10,782 --> 01:21:12,284
but my boss wouldn't let me go.

1590
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:14,327
You missed like
almost all of it.

1591
01:21:14,411 --> 01:21:15,411
I know.

1592
01:21:16,037 --> 01:21:17,037
But I'm here now.

1593
01:21:18,957 --> 01:21:20,125
Please don't be mad.

1594
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:21,918
I thought you weren't
gonna come at all.

1595
01:21:22,002 --> 01:21:23,962
You're the worst dad ever.

1596
01:21:26,548 --> 01:21:28,008
I can't tell you
how hard it's been

1597
01:21:28,091 --> 01:21:29,342
not having your mom around.

1598
01:21:32,053 --> 01:21:33,555
I can't do everything myself.

1599
01:21:34,556 --> 01:21:35,807
You're never home

1600
01:21:35,890 --> 01:21:37,893
and you never care
about anything I do.

1601
01:21:37,976 --> 01:21:38,976
I hate you.

1602
01:21:42,022 --> 01:21:44,065
Please understand, Vanessa.

1603
01:21:45,066 --> 01:21:46,443
I'm so sorry.

1604
01:21:47,485 --> 01:21:49,154
I just wanna go home.

1605
01:21:49,237 --> 01:21:50,797
I already messed up
in the second round.

1606
01:21:52,532 --> 01:21:55,160
Sweetie, if your mother
were here right now,

1607
01:21:55,243 --> 01:21:56,243
she'd be so proud of you.

1608
01:21:57,996 --> 01:21:59,914
I want to go home.

1609
01:21:59,998 --> 01:22:00,998
Come on, Vanessa.

1610
01:22:03,209 --> 01:22:04,044
Come on, Vanessa.

1611
01:22:04,127 --> 01:22:05,837
You still have a chance.

1612
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:07,422
But I already messed up.

1613
01:22:07,505 --> 01:22:08,965
So what?

1614
01:22:09,049 --> 01:22:11,593
This last challenge is
what matters most anyway.

1615
01:22:11,676 --> 01:22:13,303
All right,
children. It's time.

1616
01:22:15,805 --> 01:22:16,640
Mr. Weiler.

1617
01:22:16,723 --> 01:22:19,017
I haven't seen you in a while.

1618
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:20,894
Yes, apologies.

1619
01:22:20,977 --> 01:22:21,996
Well, please have a seat.

1620
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:23,938
We're about to start.

1621
01:22:24,022 --> 01:22:25,022
Come on.

1622
01:22:30,028 --> 01:22:30,737
Thanks, Jody.

1623
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:32,238
Don't mention it.

1624
01:22:46,461 --> 01:22:50,423
Bakers, this is your
third and final challenge.

1625
01:22:50,507 --> 01:22:52,008
You have your
ingredients with you

1626
01:22:52,092 --> 01:22:53,969
that you brought from home.

1627
01:22:54,052 --> 01:22:57,097
You will have 45
minutes to create

1628
01:22:57,180 --> 01:23:00,850
the Ultimate Spring
No Bake Cheesecake.

1629
01:23:01,976 --> 01:23:03,269
Okay, ready?

1630
01:23:03,353 --> 01:23:04,521
Okay.

1631
01:23:04,604 --> 01:23:06,690
Ready, set,

1632
01:23:06,773 --> 01:23:07,773
bake!

1633
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:11,361
Go Vanessa!

1634
01:23:12,570 --> 01:23:14,280
You got this, Jody!

1635
01:23:26,167 --> 01:23:27,961
Go, Brie!

1636
01:23:28,044 --> 01:23:29,754
Go, Millie!

1637
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:31,214
You got this, Jody.

1638
01:23:31,297 --> 01:23:32,297
Yes, Jody!

1639
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:40,724
Push through, Brie.

1640
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:44,018
I'm trying.

1641
01:23:46,271 --> 01:23:48,648
Yeah, she just broke her arm.

1642
01:23:49,691 --> 01:23:50,691
Oh.

1643
01:23:51,693 --> 01:23:52,693
♪ Oh ♪

1644
01:23:58,491 --> 01:24:00,493
Oh my sweet jellybeans.

1645
01:24:08,126 --> 01:24:09,002
Oh my gosh.

1646
01:24:09,085 --> 01:24:10,187
This would be so much easier

1647
01:24:10,211 --> 01:24:11,755
with an electric mixer.

1648
01:24:11,838 --> 01:24:14,048
Brie, if you need to stop, stop.

1649
01:24:14,132 --> 01:24:14,883
It's okay.

1650
01:24:14,966 --> 01:24:16,134
Don't hurt yourself.

1651
01:24:16,217 --> 01:24:17,217
I'm fine.

1652
01:24:18,803 --> 01:24:20,388
How much time is left?

1653
01:24:20,472 --> 01:24:21,723
Oh, right.

1654
01:24:21,806 --> 01:24:22,807
20 minutes left, bakers.

1655
01:24:37,822 --> 01:24:38,822
Sugar!

1656
01:24:39,491 --> 01:24:40,742
You okay, Millie?

1657
01:24:40,825 --> 01:24:42,827
Yeah, I dropped my blueberries.

1658
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:43,911
Luckily I have more.

1659
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,418
Go, Millie bear!

1660
01:24:50,502 --> 01:24:52,022
Three minutes,
bakers. Three minutes.

1661
01:25:11,898 --> 01:25:13,274
Look at Jody.

1662
01:25:13,358 --> 01:25:17,112
I mean, he is just like so
good at what he's doing.

1663
01:25:19,072 --> 01:25:21,199
One minute left, bakers.

1664
01:25:22,909 --> 01:25:23,909
I know!

1665
01:25:27,705 --> 01:25:28,540
Woo-hoo!

1666
01:25:28,623 --> 01:25:29,791
You're almost there.

1667
01:25:29,874 --> 01:25:31,376
Go, Millie bear, go!

1668
01:26:06,244 --> 01:26:11,082
Five, four, three, two, one.

1669
01:26:11,165 --> 01:26:13,167
Time! Hands up, bakers.

1670
01:26:17,672 --> 01:26:19,090
Good job, Brie.

1671
01:26:24,596 --> 01:26:26,139
That's pretty close, guys.

1672
01:26:26,222 --> 01:26:27,222
Woo!

1673
01:26:43,656 --> 01:26:46,409
They all look
really, really good.

1674
01:26:46,492 --> 01:26:48,953
Bakers, you will
now individually

1675
01:26:49,037 --> 01:26:51,164
present your final bakes.

1676
01:26:51,247 --> 01:26:52,540
Jody, we'll start with you.

1677
01:26:56,252 --> 01:26:57,545
For the final challenge

1678
01:26:57,629 --> 01:27:02,508
I made a salted caramel
no bake cheesecake

1679
01:27:02,592 --> 01:27:04,344
with graham cracker crust

1680
01:27:04,427 --> 01:27:05,845
and a cream cheese filling.

1681
01:27:06,763 --> 01:27:07,931
Thank you, Jody.

1682
01:27:08,014 --> 01:27:09,414
You may now go back
to your station.

1683
01:27:10,391 --> 01:27:11,392
Next, Brie.

1684
01:27:17,649 --> 01:27:20,902
I made a milk chocolate
no bake cheesecake

1685
01:27:20,985 --> 01:27:22,820
with crushed Oreo crust,

1686
01:27:22,904 --> 01:27:24,530
chocolate cream cheese filling,

1687
01:27:24,614 --> 01:27:27,325
and caramel swirls with
whipped cream on top.

1688
01:27:27,408 --> 01:27:28,993
Mm, chocolate!

1689
01:27:30,328 --> 01:27:31,537
Thank you, Brie.

1690
01:27:31,621 --> 01:27:33,539
You may go back to your station.

1691
01:27:33,623 --> 01:27:34,623
Next, Millie.

1692
01:27:38,544 --> 01:27:39,544
Hola.

1693
01:27:39,587 --> 01:27:41,589
Today I made a vanilla
no bake cheesecake

1694
01:27:41,673 --> 01:27:44,092
with vanilla lemon
cream cheese filling,

1695
01:27:44,175 --> 01:27:46,344
topped with fresh
strawberries and blueberries.

1696
01:27:49,430 --> 01:27:51,015
Thank you, Millie.

1697
01:27:51,099 --> 01:27:52,892
And, lastly, Vanessa.

1698
01:27:57,981 --> 01:28:00,233
Today I made a strawberry
no bake cheesecake

1699
01:28:00,316 --> 01:28:01,859
with a graham cracker crust

1700
01:28:01,943 --> 01:28:04,028
filled with a fresh
strawberry filling.

1701
01:28:06,572 --> 01:28:07,490
Thank you, Vanessa.

1702
01:28:07,573 --> 01:28:08,992
Please go back to your station.

1703
01:28:33,391 --> 01:28:34,225
I mean, come on, it's a cat.

1704
01:28:34,308 --> 01:28:36,978
Who doesn't love a cat cake?

1705
01:28:37,061 --> 01:28:38,354
That was very cute, right?

1706
01:28:38,438 --> 01:28:39,638
Was that just whipped cream?

1707
01:28:39,689 --> 01:28:41,274
That was a little lazy.

1708
01:28:41,357 --> 01:28:42,442
I think I'm good.

1709
01:28:45,069 --> 01:28:46,069
All right.

1710
01:28:47,113 --> 01:28:48,489
Oh my god.

1711
01:28:48,573 --> 01:28:49,741
Is it Oreo?

1712
01:28:49,824 --> 01:28:52,493
Oreo is my favorite.
Seriously good.

1713
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:53,286
Eat that.

1714
01:28:53,369 --> 01:28:54,704
I'm going to.

1715
01:28:54,787 --> 01:28:56,372
Oh my god.
They put caramel

1716
01:28:56,456 --> 01:28:57,456
on this one too.

1717
01:28:59,125 --> 01:29:00,501
She did this, didn't she?

1718
01:29:03,504 --> 01:29:05,423
Like OMG, right?
That is the best

1719
01:29:05,506 --> 01:29:07,425
dang cheesecake I've ever had.

1720
01:29:07,508 --> 01:29:08,718
Pass me the cake.

1721
01:29:08,801 --> 01:29:09,677
I mean the cat.

1722
01:29:09,761 --> 01:29:11,929
Pass me the cat.
Mmmm-mm.

1723
01:29:12,013 --> 01:29:13,613
Hold on, I need another
bite of this one.

1724
01:29:23,608 --> 01:29:25,109
It's not half bad.

1725
01:29:26,444 --> 01:29:27,612
It's kinda good.

1726
01:29:27,695 --> 01:29:29,415
Does it look better
than it tastes though?

1727
01:29:30,907 --> 01:29:31,949
Probably, yeah.

1728
01:29:33,367 --> 01:29:35,411
You gotta be careful for that.

1729
01:29:35,495 --> 01:29:37,497
Is this the one she screwed up?

1730
01:29:37,580 --> 01:29:38,414
I don't know.

1731
01:29:38,498 --> 01:29:39,707
It just looks like a cat.

1732
01:29:39,791 --> 01:29:41,709
Hey, at least there's
some cheesecake.

1733
01:29:41,793 --> 01:29:44,587
There's no sugar.

1734
01:29:44,670 --> 01:29:45,963
I actually like that.

1735
01:29:46,047 --> 01:29:47,256
It's not as rich.

1736
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:48,549
Exactly.

1737
01:29:48,633 --> 01:29:49,693
This is like a diabetic cake.

1738
01:29:49,717 --> 01:29:51,037
Like this is what
my grandma eats.

1739
01:29:58,184 --> 01:29:59,435
This one's very fruity.

1740
01:29:59,519 --> 01:30:01,312
It's good, it's good.

1741
01:30:04,065 --> 01:30:05,065
This is Vanessa's.

1742
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:08,152
I think I'm good guys.

1743
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:09,445
I've got mine up.

1744
01:30:09,529 --> 01:30:10,196
I just need to try
this one more time

1745
01:30:10,279 --> 01:30:11,114
because it's plain.

1746
01:30:11,197 --> 01:30:12,490
I need to cleanse my palette.

1747
01:30:12,573 --> 01:30:13,573
You go ahead.

1748
01:30:23,793 --> 01:30:25,086
Come on, Brie.

1749
01:30:34,804 --> 01:30:35,804
Are we ready?

1750
01:30:39,559 --> 01:30:43,563
The winner of this
year's Spring No Bake,

1751
01:30:43,646 --> 01:30:45,398
Bake Off Challenge

1752
01:30:45,481 --> 01:30:48,401
and the winner of four
Cosmo Land tickets

1753
01:30:48,484 --> 01:30:51,696
and $5,000 is

1754
01:31:06,627 --> 01:31:07,837
Brie Hayes!

1755
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:09,005
No way!

1756
01:31:09,088 --> 01:31:10,506
Yes! Congratulations!

1757
01:31:16,637 --> 01:31:18,181
Are you serious?

1758
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:22,226
She doesn't even believe it.

1759
01:31:24,979 --> 01:31:26,522
Go Brie!

1760
01:31:33,237 --> 01:31:34,237
Go, Brie!

1761
01:31:37,658 --> 01:31:39,243
Go, baby! Go, baby!

1762
01:31:40,661 --> 01:31:41,661
I knew it!

1763
01:31:41,704 --> 01:31:42,705
I told you, I told you!

1764
01:31:43,539 --> 01:31:45,791
Let's go, let's go.

1765
01:31:45,875 --> 01:31:46,875
Hey!

1766
01:31:49,754 --> 01:31:50,796
I am so proud of you.

1767
01:31:52,423 --> 01:31:53,633
That's our girl.

1768
01:31:53,716 --> 01:31:54,776
I'm pretty sure you can go get

1769
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:56,052
some chocolate cheesecake now.

1770
01:31:56,135 --> 01:31:57,135
Yes!

1771
01:31:58,262 --> 01:31:59,138
How's your arm feeling?

1772
01:31:59,222 --> 01:32:00,431
It's good.
That's good.

1773
01:32:00,514 --> 01:32:01,533
It doesn't hurt very much.
Yeah?

1774
01:32:01,557 --> 01:32:02,266
I am so proud of you.

1775
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:03,184
I knew you could do it.

1776
01:32:03,267 --> 01:32:04,685
It was all those trials, Brie.

1777
01:32:04,769 --> 01:32:05,603
I told you they were gonna work.

1778
01:32:05,686 --> 01:32:07,438
You did so good.

1779
01:32:07,521 --> 01:32:10,566
You did so good,
I'm so proud of you.

1780
01:32:12,151 --> 01:32:15,071
My heart was beating
way above average.

1781
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:17,281
What a great Bake Off.

1782
01:32:17,365 --> 01:32:18,365
It was, it was.

1783
01:32:19,909 --> 01:32:21,285
But how did I do?

1784
01:32:21,369 --> 01:32:23,955
Oh, you did a
fantastic job announcing.

1785
01:32:24,038 --> 01:32:24,872
Why, thank you.

1786
01:32:24,956 --> 01:32:26,249
You did a great job judging.

1787
01:32:26,332 --> 01:32:27,583
Oh, thank you.

1788
01:32:27,667 --> 01:32:28,376
Oh, honey!

1789
01:32:28,459 --> 01:32:30,127
I'm so proud of you.

1790
01:32:30,211 --> 01:32:31,379
Thank you, love.

1791
01:32:31,462 --> 01:32:33,589
Andrew, this is my wife, Sophia.

1792
01:32:33,673 --> 01:32:34,590
Hi.

1793
01:32:34,674 --> 01:32:35,841
Of course it is.

1794
01:32:35,925 --> 01:32:37,802
Oh, wait, Andrew.

1795
01:32:37,885 --> 01:32:40,137
You gave Lester the
essential oils, right?

1796
01:32:40,221 --> 01:32:42,765
I absolutely love them.

1797
01:32:42,848 --> 01:32:44,558
Yes, yes I did.

1798
01:32:45,726 --> 01:32:46,769
Great meeting you.

1799
01:32:47,645 --> 01:32:49,146
Yeah, you too.
Excuse me.

1800
01:32:53,859 --> 01:32:54,859
It's okay.

1801
01:32:55,820 --> 01:32:57,655
You're a strong independent man.

1802
01:32:58,864 --> 01:33:00,324
Yes.

1803
01:33:00,408 --> 01:33:02,660
Now I just need something
to fill my heart.

1804
01:33:02,743 --> 01:33:03,828
Cheesecake.

1805
01:33:06,914 --> 01:33:09,208
And a glass of wine.
Excuse me, guys.

1806
01:33:09,292 --> 01:33:10,668
Hey, Sophia.
Hey.

1807
01:33:10,751 --> 01:33:11,544
It's so nice to see you again.

1808
01:33:11,627 --> 01:33:12,646
Oh, nice to see you too.

1809
01:33:12,670 --> 01:33:13,730
How are you?
How's everything?

1810
01:33:13,754 --> 01:33:15,034
It's good. How's the business?

1811
01:33:15,089 --> 01:33:17,133
Oh, it's
fantastic. It's great.

1812
01:33:17,216 --> 01:33:18,443
Good, you
did such a good job today.

1813
01:33:18,467 --> 01:33:19,827
I forgot you
two know each other.

1814
01:33:19,885 --> 01:33:20,885
Thank you.

1815
01:33:20,928 --> 01:33:22,263
You did great, Millie bear.

1816
01:33:22,346 --> 01:33:23,139
Thanks, Mom.

1817
01:33:23,222 --> 01:33:24,724
I'm so proud of you.

1818
01:33:24,807 --> 01:33:25,641
How should we celebrate?

1819
01:33:25,725 --> 01:33:28,477
Hmm. Cheesecake.

1820
01:33:28,561 --> 01:33:29,561
Okay! Let's do it.

1821
01:33:31,856 --> 01:33:35,401
Son, we practiced
this 100 times.

1822
01:33:35,484 --> 01:33:37,486
You must've measured the
vanilla extract wrong.

1823
01:33:37,570 --> 01:33:38,570
Sorry, Dad.

1824
01:33:38,612 --> 01:33:39,715
Hon, don't be so hard on him.

1825
01:33:39,739 --> 01:33:40,865
He did great.

1826
01:33:40,948 --> 01:33:42,450
You did great, Jody.

1827
01:33:42,533 --> 01:33:43,576
Thanks, Mom.

1828
01:33:43,659 --> 01:33:45,036
You did great.

1829
01:33:46,287 --> 01:33:48,706
Mom would've been
so proud of you.

1830
01:33:48,789 --> 01:33:50,833
Your cheesecake looks amazing.

1831
01:33:50,916 --> 01:33:52,418
Thanks, Dad.

1832
01:34:03,137 --> 01:34:06,640
Mm, smells like chocolate.
Thank you.

1833
01:34:06,724 --> 01:34:08,809
Whoever
made this did a real good job.

1834
01:34:08,893 --> 01:34:09,727
Which one?

1835
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:11,103
That one.

1836
01:34:20,946 --> 01:34:22,073
Can I sit with you?

1837
01:34:22,156 --> 01:34:24,992
No, but you
probably will anyway.

1838
01:34:28,871 --> 01:34:31,791
I'm sorry for everything
I did to you, Brie.

1839
01:34:31,874 --> 01:34:33,793
You think a sorry
will unbreak my arm?

1840
01:34:33,876 --> 01:34:34,877
No.

1841
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:36,212
I never meant that to happen.

1842
01:34:36,295 --> 01:34:38,135
You never even said
sorry when it did happen.

1843
01:34:38,172 --> 01:34:41,300
Because I didn't
think you wanted to talk to me.

1844
01:34:41,384 --> 01:34:44,136
Well, I just wanted to tell you

1845
01:34:44,220 --> 01:34:45,805
that I never meant
to not be there

1846
01:34:45,888 --> 01:34:46,806
when your mom died.

1847
01:34:46,889 --> 01:34:48,641
Yeah, I know.

1848
01:34:48,724 --> 01:34:49,850
Do you really?

1849
01:34:49,934 --> 01:34:50,934
Yeah.

1850
01:34:51,936 --> 01:34:53,771
I was just mean to you
when we were younger

1851
01:34:53,854 --> 01:34:55,606
so you wouldn't
come over anymore.

1852
01:34:55,689 --> 01:34:56,689
Why?

1853
01:34:58,150 --> 01:35:01,404
Because my mom
loved having you over

1854
01:35:01,487 --> 01:35:03,739
and you got all the attention
when you were there.

1855
01:35:03,823 --> 01:35:05,408
So I started being mean to you

1856
01:35:06,367 --> 01:35:07,910
so that we wouldn't be friends

1857
01:35:07,993 --> 01:35:10,121
and then, well, you know.

1858
01:35:10,204 --> 01:35:14,959
Well, I'm sorry
for everything too.

1859
01:35:15,042 --> 01:35:16,042
I know.

1860
01:35:19,088 --> 01:35:21,424
Vanessa, can I talk
to you for a sec?

1861
01:35:21,507 --> 01:35:22,550
Uh, yeah.

1862
01:35:24,969 --> 01:35:26,429
Sorry I lied to
you about my dad.

1863
01:35:26,512 --> 01:35:28,347
He's not really a doctor.

1864
01:35:28,431 --> 01:35:29,598
Oh, no.

1865
01:35:29,682 --> 01:35:30,516
I wanted to see
if you would like

1866
01:35:30,599 --> 01:35:31,809
to eat dinner with me tonight.

1867
01:35:31,892 --> 01:35:32,892
Really?

1868
01:35:32,935 --> 01:35:35,813
Yeah, I mean, my
parents would be there

1869
01:35:35,896 --> 01:35:37,314
but they can sit
at another table.

1870
01:35:37,398 --> 01:35:38,691
That's awesome.

1871
01:35:38,774 --> 01:35:40,568
Do you think my
dad could come too?

1872
01:35:40,651 --> 01:35:42,153
He needs more
company these days.

1873
01:35:42,236 --> 01:35:44,196
Yeah, of course.

1874
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:45,948
You wanna go inside now, Brie?

1875
01:35:46,949 --> 01:35:47,867
I'll wait for my dad.

1876
01:35:47,950 --> 01:35:48,993
You guys go ahead.

1877
01:35:49,076 --> 01:35:50,578
Okay, see you in there.

1878
01:35:53,664 --> 01:35:55,332
Don't tell me any
bad news, Grant.

1879
01:35:57,626 --> 01:35:58,626
Mm-hmm.

1880
01:36:00,546 --> 01:36:01,546
Yeah.

1881
01:36:03,215 --> 01:36:04,215
You didn't?

1882
01:36:05,718 --> 01:36:06,718
Yes!

1883
01:36:07,344 --> 01:36:08,344
Thank you! Finally!

1884
01:36:10,848 --> 01:36:11,848
All right.

1885
01:36:12,808 --> 01:36:14,268
Okay, I'll call you tomorrow.

1886
01:36:14,351 --> 01:36:16,353
Bye.

1887
01:36:18,481 --> 01:36:19,583
Looks like you're
not the only one

1888
01:36:19,607 --> 01:36:20,858
getting a big fat check.

1889
01:36:20,941 --> 01:36:22,568
They tripled my advance,

1890
01:36:22,651 --> 01:36:24,195
more stores want my book.

1891
01:36:24,278 --> 01:36:25,070

have to take money

1901

out of your savings anymore.

1902
01:36:37,875 --> 01:36:38,875
Savings?

1903
01:36:39,627 --> 01:36:40,878
You know about that?

1904
01:36:40,961 --> 01:36:41,961
Uh, no, no.

1905
01:36:43,672 --> 01:36:44,924
Well, it doesn't matter

Oh, Dad.
Yes?

1909
01:36:50,679 --> 01:36:52,199
Is $5,000 enough
for culinary school?

1910
01:36:52,223 --> 01:36:53,849
Not even close.

1911
01:36:53,933 --> 01:36:56,101
