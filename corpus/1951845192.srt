1
00:00:46,961 --> 00:00:48,791
In the land of "SPARTA"

2
00:00:49,031 --> 00:00:49,991
Are babies born,

3
00:00:50,372 --> 00:00:54,501
Checked for errors
By the ancient prophets.

4
00:00:55,575 --> 00:00:58,561
Ah! Are you my mother?

5
00:00:58,946 --> 00:01:00,866
Because I am ready,
To your nipples used to suck!

6
00:01:09,296 --> 00:01:11,836
And if there is a mistake in Saturday ...

7
00:01:11,836 --> 00:01:13,565
Then the babies were launched.

8
00:01:15,389 --> 00:01:17,310
If it is a Vietnamese baby,

9
00:01:17,988 --> 00:01:20,870
Then Angelina is the first option.

10
00:01:25,092 --> 00:01:25,908
Lovely, huh?

11
00:01:26,864 --> 00:01:29,518
And then you Leonidas ...

12
00:01:29,051 --> 00:01:30,997
AWOE!

13
00:01:31,237 --> 00:01:32,691
The perfect Spartaan.

14
00:01:36,308 --> 00:01:37,940
GOOD KVALIFICIRAN BY PROFEET # 12

15
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,184
At a young age,

16
00:01:41,616 --> 00:01:43,258
Leerde Leonidas all to fight.

17
00:01:43,498 --> 00:01:45,285
Come on, you little opdonder.
Come on!

18
00:01:45,621 --> 00:01:48,827
You can not win me!
You will never be a good Spartaan, never!

19
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:50,303
Here Grandma ... Suit?

20
00:01:54,692 --> 00:01:57,573
He was tortured ...
But torture is not very!

21
00:01:59,347 --> 00:02:02,265
Tell me again, Mr.. Bond,
What is your account number?

22
00:02:02,505 --> 00:02:04,527
Who's really weather, Mr.Bond?

23
00:02:04,767 --> 00:02:06,175
I am Leonidas.

24
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:08,217
You are my patience to the test
Double "00"

25
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:11,367
I am not double ooooh ...

26
00:02:15,071 --> 00:02:17,013
Let the sun shine even more for me.

27
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,056
That looks good from huh?

28
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,561
But it is this time
Not in your mouth.

29
00:02:24,293 --> 00:02:28,327
Ah, there you are!
Mr.Bond ... This is best mothers.

30
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:37,587
Leonidas was put in the middle of the wilderness,

31
00:02:37,827 --> 00:02:39,988
To learn survival.

32
00:02:45,016 --> 00:02:47,465
He remained calm sitting,

33
00:02:47,841 --> 00:02:50,050
And went into famine ...

34
00:02:58,577 --> 00:03:02,227
No Mayo?
This is worthless!

35
00:03:05,406 --> 00:03:07,951
The beast, looked Leonidas ...

36
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,881
With red eyes that burn
If the fire in hell.

37
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,531
Man, you have Feets Happy!

38
00:03:33,305 --> 00:03:36,364
I am on the point of my Happy Feet
Under your ass to kick, idiot!

39
00:03:36,604 --> 00:03:38,020
Brave penguin!

40
00:03:37,113 --> 00:03:38,686
Where are you going, mietje?

41
00:03:42,038 --> 00:03:44,015
I take you my sletje, Leonidas.

42
00:03:47,282 --> 00:03:52,065
This can get you from me.
-- Oh, I absolutely stink!

43
00:03:52,305 --> 00:03:53,686
That's because your mouth was open.

44
00:04:05,406 --> 00:04:06,630
You are dead Leonidas.

45
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,055
Let us say ...
Like Anna Nicole!

46
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:16,007
Damn, I stuck!
We have a Penguin in distress!

47
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,505
Help! Help!

48
00:04:20,376 --> 00:04:23,022
"In the event of an attack penguin glass onto"

49
00:04:25,063 --> 00:04:26,217
My rear!

50
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:27,814
My achterwerk hurts ...!

51
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,020
Why do you kill me thus?

52
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,433
Come on, man!

53
00:04:31,112 --> 00:04:33,205
I will be good!
We have come together.

54
00:04:33,445 --> 00:04:34,930
I made a joke!

55
00:04:39,537 --> 00:04:42,418
And the boy who once was in the wilderness ...

56
00:04:42,692 --> 00:04:44,943
Keerde back as a king!

57
00:05:25,531 --> 00:05:27,452
Wow!

58
00:05:29,566 --> 00:05:31,487
Boops!

59
00:05:36,674 --> 00:05:38,403
You want to write something here?

60
00:05:39,354 --> 00:05:41,140
They are still really too!

61
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:41,861
Yes!

62
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:46,860
Trouw you with me?

63
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:57,422
What's that?
-- The combination of my kuisheidsgordel.

64
00:06:16,182 --> 00:06:18,279
Leonidas was immediately sold ...

65p [
00:06:19,621 --> 00:06:22,860
He married Margo and they
Gave him a good son ...

66
00:06:24,604 --> 00:06:27,485
Life in the land of Sparta,
Was good.

67
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:32,143
Yes! Yes! Well done!

68
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,299
Thank you Papa!

69
00:06:37,248 --> 00:06:40,059
Give me your hand.
Remember my son ...

70
00:06:40,881 --> 00:06:43,241
A warrior must learn
To his head instead.

71
00:06:45,619 --> 00:06:46,846
Fight with your head,

72
00:06:47,609 --> 00:06:49,104
Think with your heart.

73
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,924
Let him the piledriver agree,
Treasure!

74
00:06:53,876 --> 00:06:54,761
The piledriver?

75
00:07:00,267 --> 00:07:01,189
That's my boy.

76
00:07:09,678 --> 00:07:11,372
My Queen!
-- Captain!

77
00:07:13,053 --> 00:07:16,128
So, therefore Leonidas teaches the future
King of Sparta how to be a man.

78
00:07:20,555 --> 00:07:23,292
I know that even if I
Was beaten by my father

79
00:07:24,336 --> 00:07:26,257
Lijk you on him?

80
00:07:27,444 --> 00:07:29,069
No, my father was an alcoholic.

81
00:07:35,447 --> 00:07:37,704
Xerxes messenger wait, my king.

82
00:07:44,771 --> 00:07:47,653
Leonidas Greetings!
-- Greetings messenger!

83
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:52,109
Why the devil was that?

84
00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:54,327
What?
-- You have given me just a tongzoen!

85
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,646
Thus Spartan men greet each other here.

86
00:07:57,516 --> 00:07:58,621
High five for the women,

87
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:02,851
Tongzoenen and open for the men.

88
00:08:13,057 --> 00:08:14,634
I get the picture!
-- What snap you?

89
00:08:16,527 --> 00:08:18,894
You live in a free society.

90
00:08:19,073 --> 00:08:20,094
Yes!

91
00:08:20,295 --> 00:08:22,792
We are free!
-- There is nothing wrong with that yet ...

92
00:08:29,272 --> 00:08:31,318
I do so with great black men.

93
00:08:32,648 --> 00:08:33,522
Yes!

94
00:08:34,508 --> 00:08:36,657
Come messenger, let's develop
Eindje go.

95
00:08:41,255 --> 00:08:44,895
The great king Xerxes, the whole world
With his Persian army already has taken.

96
00:08:45,912 --> 00:08:47,889
He is not satisfied with his
Last victory ...

97
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:49,612
Sparta!

98
00:08:53,497 --> 00:08:55,830
Let us continue to talk to the
Death put large.

99
00:08:56,388 --> 00:08:58,069
Okay!

100
00:08:57,935 --> 00:08:59,671
Xerxes is a kind of God king,

101
00:08:59,859 --> 00:09:02,776
He has a friendly offer instead of a war.
"PUT DES DEATH"

102
00:09:05,599 --> 00:09:07,597
There will be no blood flow ...

103
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:08,888
Until that the Spartan men
Piramides start building,

104
00:09:09,984 --> 00:09:12,972
You women are seksslavinnen!

105
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:17,987
And your children ... Working in the sweat.
Because they make Nikie.

106
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,204
That sounds reasonable.

107
00:09:23,561 --> 00:09:25,482
I believe that you also
Sun thinks about, Treathero.

108
00:09:55,089 --> 00:09:56,280
Say against Xerxes,

109
00:09:58,486 --> 00:10:00,379
That his proposal,

110
00:10:01,478 --> 00:10:02,541
And his work ...

111
00:10:03,945 --> 00:10:05,185
What the devil?

112
00:10:05,487 --> 00:10:06,447
What?
He took me!

113
00:10:07,511 --> 00:10:09,432
That I did not.
But ... Your wife is a whore!

114
00:10:13,141 --> 00:10:14,574
This means war!

115
00:10:15,831 --> 00:10:18,533
It has been good ...
We have been in San Francisco ...

116
00:10:18,741 --> 00:10:21,023
The West Hollywood!
We have no need Sparta.

117
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:23,086
I am simply against Xerxes
It is not continuing.

118
00:10:30,883 --> 00:10:31,844
Trap him under his ass!

119
00:10:35,682 --> 00:10:36,720
This is ridiculous.

120
00:10:37,828 --> 00:10:39,301
Belachelijk?

121
00:10:41,964 --> 00:10:44,179
This ... ... Sparta!

122
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:53,671
Why did you believe it?
He had already entered.

123
00:10:58,323 --> 00:11:00,966
My king, he will say against Xerxes
Sparta That is not at issue.

124
00:11:01,104 --> 00:11:03,378
So, whatever you do,
Trap him in the pit of death.

125
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,914
Hou benefit to people in the
Death to put spades, really!

126
00:11:13,545 --> 00:11:16,286
I wonder why people always
To my head zeuren.

127
00:11:17,187 --> 00:11:20,221
I am an adult child,
Look now, I give my baby breastfeeding!

128
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:24,572
Sometimes I give him kunstmelk, you know those balls,
That is similar to breast milk but from balls.

129
00:11:24,813 --> 00:11:27,694
That stop you in your mouth!
He thinks it is good, he baby?

130
00:11:34,312 --> 00:11:35,273
I could very well buy

131
00:11:35,468 --> 00:11:38,349
This entire set I bought in an alley
Of a Mexican woman.

132
00:11:42,178 --> 00:11:43,139
Why do you think all
I always verziek on?

133
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:45,399
Am I crazy one, right now?

134
00:11:56,381 --> 00:11:58,302
Oh, verdorie that is my responsibility!

135
00:11:58,979 --> 00:12:00,900
You can not hold him, hear!

136
00:12:17,669 --> 00:12:19,684
I am not gay!

137
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:24,269
Leonidas!
-- Bryan Seaquest?

138
00:12:25,002 --> 00:12:28,101
Let us listen to what the jury
This matches.

139
00:12:28,342 --> 00:12:30,899
Really ... Leo man, I could not follow you
When you gave trap, man!

140
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:32,689
That did you do good, man.

141
00:12:32,612 --> 00:12:37,170
Paula?
-- You ... Let me move.

142
00:12:41,076 --> 00:12:41,834
Simon?

143
00:12:42,593 --> 00:12:48,086
I found that really terrible trap.
-- Ah, Simon?

144
00:12:49,761 --> 00:12:51,681
I have even seen better stairways,

145
00:12:51,484 --> 00:12:52,824
1 with a donkey bone!

146
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:57,627
And I am not talking about you, Paula!
-- Oh, go yourself anyway #!:$!

147
00:13:06,714 --> 00:13:08,635
Seaquest has been dropped!

148
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:11,335
Excellent, my king.

149
00:13:12,133 --> 00:13:14,054
It's time for your appointment with the prophets.

150
00:13:21,487 --> 00:13:23,501
Umazanije AFZUIGING

151
00:13:28,049 --> 00:13:30,734
The prophets had a way
Conversation with the King.

152
00:13:30,974 --> 00:13:36,017
For everything smoothly ...
Did the King with a bag full of products.

153
00:13:40,493 --> 00:13:43,380
Oxytan ... Nutrogina ...

154
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,221
It has a high spf.
It provides all protection.

155
00:13:46,882 --> 00:13:49,174
Look here for,
Hydroxide for extra dry skin,

156
00:13:49,985 --> 00:13:53,268
This is good for you,
Rub it over your ugly face.

157
00:13:54,538 --> 00:13:57,100
What do you need, King Leonidas?

158
00:13:57,672 --> 00:13:59,315
Ancient prophets ...

159
00:13:59,347 --> 00:14:01,220
I need your advice.

160
00:14:01,645 --> 00:14:04,928
I have an army of 300 men needed
For a war with Perzien.

161
00:14:05,422 --> 00:14:08,256
I will deal with them first, before.

162
00:14:08,688 --> 00:14:10,785
And then I shoot achterlangs,

163
00:14:11,553 --> 00:14:13,292
And then I pack them again.

164
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:17,891
What?
Why are you so to laugh!

165
00:14:18,213 --> 00:14:20,396
Nothing special ... It's nothing ...

166
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:22,451
What's so damn funny?

167
00:14:22,894 --> 00:14:24,252
Look, here is everything,
So you can see ...

168
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,103
This is an attack from behind.

169
00:14:25,951 --> 00:14:29,737
Attacks from behind, which is good.
Like a rear attack by Elton John.

170
00:14:31,466 --> 00:14:34,124
Hold on! This is not funny,
It is a serious matter.

171
00:14:34,694 --> 00:14:41,657
None Spartaan leaves for a war
Without first listening to the Oracle.

172
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:05,075
The Prophets choose only the
Most beautiful girls of Sparta ...

173
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:07,513
For their Oracle to be.

174
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,426
Konden you find nothing better than Betty?
-- It has a good appearance.

175
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,020
Oeh!

176
00:15:20,535 --> 00:15:23,419
I see are like Jabba the Hut,
For me that is very sexy.

177
00:15:43,145 --> 00:15:45,066
Ooh.

178
00:15:49,426 --> 00:15:51,793
Well, she likes ... I think ...

179
00:15:55,876 --> 00:15:59,161
A shaved head,
One that saves the world.

180
00:15:59,178 --> 00:16:01,897
Hebbes Leon!
I am not a hero.

181
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:04,574
Klootzak says what?
-- What?

182
00:16:09,033 --> 00:16:11,081
Borstwaxer says what?
-- What?

183
00:16:13,508 --> 00:16:15,429
You are great!

184
00:16:15,292 --> 00:16:17,121
What, what do you say all against me?
I can not.

185
00:16:17,361 --> 00:16:20,647
If you are at war with Persia,
Then you will surely die.

186
00:16:23,826 --> 00:16:25,854
You go out, man!

187
00:16:49,947 --> 00:16:50,991
What?

188
00:16:54,455 --> 00:16:56,400
He looks like a Ken doll.

189
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:02,144
It is cold.

190
00:17:12,225 --> 00:17:13,679
Here was Leonidas

191
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:20,318
Like ...

192
00:17:20,588 --> 00:17:22,090
Tommy Lee?

193
00:17:22,282 --> 00:17:24,157
Kobe

194
00:17:26,052 --> 00:17:27,397
Shaggie!

195
00:17:27,361 --> 00:17:28,575
Dr.Phill

196
00:17:28,688 --> 00:17:29,967
Lara Reed

197
00:17:30,688 --> 00:17:32,339
Borat?

198
00:17:33,902 --> 00:17:35,103
And the Oakland Raiders

199
00:17:40,382 --> 00:17:41,893
Why is my prince so restless?

200
00:17:43,648 --> 00:17:44,618
I can not sleep.

201
00:17:45,938 --> 00:17:48,505
That whole back.

202
00:17:48,761 --> 00:17:51,738
Are you still considering what the young
Oracle said?

203
00:17:53,899 --> 00:17:56,469
There is only one woman who is worth
To listen to.

204
00:17:58,089 --> 00:18:00,049
Oprah?
-- Your wife?

205
00:18:00,856 --> 00:18:01,909
Of course, of course!

206
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,786
How will I be in the room,
With the critical eyes of the public?

207
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:11,305
Well, Harry says
THAT IS NOT GOOD NEWS

208
00:18:11,561 --> 00:18:14,447
This film but a cheap
Version of "300".

209
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,815
Even if you do not support that article ...

210
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,705
I do so very much, and Sparta.

211
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:27,647
This may be our last night together.

212
00:18:29,196 --> 00:18:30,492
Do you doing?

213
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,167
As we have never previously done together?

214
00:18:54,547 --> 00:18:57,547
97 ... 98 ...

215
00:18:58,168 --> 00:19:01,694
99 ... 100!

216
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:03,414
I have my record broken.

217
00:19:10,709 --> 00:19:12,729
Captain!
-- My King!

218
00:19:14,511 --> 00:19:17,212
Got my army prepared
To fight to the death ...

219
00:19:17,445 --> 00:19:18,858
For the freedom of Sparta?

220
00:19:19,106 --> 00:19:19,992
Yes, my King!

221
00:19:26,907 --> 00:19:27,936
I wanted to be 300.

222
00:19:29,177 --> 00:19:31,106
This looks like ... Less.

223
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:34,294
These are all men
With the best performance.

224
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:37,346
Hotny Mitterant with a 10 ...

225
00:19:38,021 --> 00:19:39,942
Beautiful buttocks, and.

226
00:19:40,617 --> 00:19:42,933
Yes?
-- Not married.

227
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:47,675
We are ready to fight for you,
My King!

228
00:19:47,869 --> 00:19:51,734
We never, we never give us over!
On eternity!

229
00:19:54,843 --> 00:19:55,908
He has a good heart, my king.

230
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,907
Beautiful male breasts.

231
00:20:02,275 --> 00:20:03,318
That is true.

232
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:05,932
These men are good.

233
00:20:07,547 --> 00:20:10,282
You are a good master, Captain.

234
00:20:10,494 --> 00:20:12,231
Such a good friend ...

235
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,302
Do you nowhere.
-- Thank you!

236
00:20:26,936 --> 00:20:28,142
Thank you.

237
00:20:32,047 --> 00:20:33,967
Zo!

238
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:36,351
S got a great package.

239
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:43,953
My father!

240
00:20:46,087 --> 00:20:47,625
Hello, my son.

241
00:20:49,557 --> 00:20:50,627
Proposals?

242
00:20:50,872 --> 00:20:52,701
Leonidas, this is my son, Soniel.

243
00:20:53,523 --> 00:20:54,411
My king.

244
00:20:54,623 --> 00:20:56,006
Why not fight it?

245
00:20:56,734 --> 00:20:57,807
He is not a fighter.

246
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,776
And he's my only son who
My name will remain on it.

247
00:21:03,812 --> 00:21:05,146
What do you think?

248
00:21:05,086 --> 00:21:06,745
Jammie!

249
00:21:07,129 --> 00:21:08,669
Say, sister.

250
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:01,366
I think he Venus.

251
00:21:18,245 --> 00:21:21,107
And if you do not like ...
Then kiss my fat ass!

252
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,349
Oeh.

253
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,461
Congratulations, Soniel.

254
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,889
You are on the verge of a
Spartan warrior should be.

255
00:21:43,907 --> 00:21:45,445
Spartaan?

256
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,270
My child!

257
00:21:56,082 --> 00:21:57,546
I will never forget you,

258
00:21:58,371 --> 00:21:59,995
You are still so small ...

259
00:22:00,696 --> 00:22:02,608
One day you will see big and strong,

260
00:22:02,897 --> 00:22:04,512
Like your father.

261
00:22:04,413 --> 00:22:05,953
That's your son.

262
00:22:07,676 --> 00:22:08,962
Imbeciel!

263
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:18,201
Make good for your mother.

264
00:22:21,838 --> 00:22:23,156
Keep it right, my son.

265
00:22:29,209 --> 00:22:31,815
Come back with your shield,
Or without.

266
00:22:31,999 --> 00:22:33,645
When I would come back without ...

267
00:22:33,845 --> 00:22:35,374
Then I want you go.

268
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,403
I can never.

269
00:22:38,189 --> 00:22:39,653
If you are dead,
Then I go pay the rent.

270
00:22:39,931 --> 00:22:41,638
Quite frankly ...

271
00:22:41,823 --> 00:22:43,721
I have always been a
Like chicken fat.

272
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:12,934
The men are ready for it, my King.

273
00:23:15,307 --> 00:23:17,436
Well, as it should be to be

274
00:23:17,661 --> 00:23:19,621
For an army that will tackle Persia.

275
00:23:19,896 --> 00:23:20,696
Where will you go?

276
00:23:20,842 --> 00:23:23,176
The Oracle says, if we go into war
That we should go.

277
00:23:23,406 --> 00:23:26,682
The Oracle says,
Or I would sign or not ...

278
00:23:26,866 --> 00:23:28,058
It is as bogus long-term prospects.

279
00:23:28,278 --> 00:23:29,316
But I sign now different.

280
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,404
Enter the character captain.

281
00:23:41,685 --> 00:23:43,576
Spartans, in-formation!

282
00:23:45,377 --> 00:23:46,060
The Spartans come to the south.

283
00:23:55,241 --> 00:23:56,173
Forward!

284
00:23:58,811 --> 00:24:02,077
Oh no, not me.
I will survive.

285
00:24:02,326 --> 00:24:05,255
Oh, as long as I know how I
Someone must take.

286
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,964
I certainly know that I will survive.

287
00:24:06,881 --> 00:24:08,706
I have my whole life to live,

288
00:24:08,762 --> 00:24:10,683
I did all my love to give.

289
00:24:10,662 --> 00:24:12,487
And I will survive.

290
00:24:12,573 --> 00:24:14,205
I will survive.

291
00:24:14,297 --> 00:24:16,218
Hey, hey!

292
00:24:16,407 --> 00:24:18,328
Hmm, hmm.
-- Oehoe!

293
00:24:36,573 --> 00:24:39,309
The Spartans reached onvreesbare
"Hot Gates"

294
00:24:39,405 --> 00:24:42,615
The danger in every corner loerden.

295
00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:47,349
Stop ... Kangoeroes!

296
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:52,767
Uitgedroogd tired of the journey,

297
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:56,483
Waiting patiently the Spartans
On their energy drink.

298
00:25:03,295 --> 00:25:06,151
Gay drink!
Are you also true?

299
00:25:12,882 --> 00:25:14,465
What's on your mind, my king?

300
00:25:14,609 --> 00:25:16,839
Well, here somewhere a secret passage
Hot run by Gates.

301
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:19,010
As we see the Persians by inward,

302
00:25:19,058 --> 00:25:21,861
Well their numbers say nothing

303
00:25:22,286 --> 00:25:25,140
Captain, your men
No other effect found,

304
00:25:25,063 --> 00:25:26,888
They can use the Persians
For us to attack?

305
00:25:27,455 --> 00:25:29,069
No, Sire!

306
00:25:29,355 --> 00:25:31,132
I know such a way, my king.

307
00:25:39,153 --> 00:25:40,998
Reverse you, ugly monster.

308
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,462
There is a secret passage,
Just before "Hot Gates"

309
00:25:43,743 --> 00:25:45,478
If the Persians behind you arrive,
They may not find you there.

310
00:25:45,773 --> 00:25:47,471
Wait just like captain?

311
00:25:49,426 --> 00:25:51,204
Ask yourself even before, sample.

312
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,625
Paris Hilton?
-- Hello boys!

313
00:25:56,912 --> 00:25:58,224
What's happened with you?

314
00:25:58,789 --> 00:26:00,716
Oh, you mean that bump?

315
00:26:01,767 --> 00:26:03,129
Yes, that bump!

316
00:26:03,525 --> 00:26:06,624
It started with, you go to prison,
You are allowed out of prison,

317
00:26:06,864 --> 00:26:09,498
You go back to jail,
And again, over and over again ...

318
00:26:11,527 --> 00:26:14,574
I was totally in the war
Even Tinkerbell has been under must suffer.

319
00:26:15,405 --> 00:26:18,235
They no longer moves since Saturday
They still poept which I find strange.

320
00:26:19,198 --> 00:26:22,310
And I then?
They have changed me in this ... This,

321
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:26,408
Terribly ugly monster.
And I do not even know ...

322
00:26:26,696 --> 00:26:27,909
Oh!

323
00:26:29,352 --> 00:26:30,985
Yes, wait a moment.

324
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:37,008
Hello? Hi Nicole!

325
00:26:37,484 --> 00:26:39,335
Nothing just a few men with their swords.

326
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:42,497
No, I mean real swords, viezerik.
Yes, I am hungry, have you eaten anything?

327
00:26:44,716 --> 00:26:47,508
Oh, you have an almond eaten?
Oh yes, then you are ready for today.

328
00:26:47,737 --> 00:26:49,508
Day, sexy ...

329
00:26:51,441 --> 00:26:54,346
Listen, it is my desire to
A Spartaan be.

330
00:26:54,731 --> 00:26:55,861
What can you do?

331
00:26:56,845 --> 00:26:58,028
Have you seen my video?

332
00:26:59,298 --> 00:27:00,288
Oh yes!

333
00:27:01,501 --> 00:27:03,325
He is pretty good.

334
00:27:03,703 --> 00:27:05,822
I am sorry, but we can not use.

335
00:27:07,846 --> 00:27:10,569
No, this is not fair!

336
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,602
Mama!

337
00:27:16,312 --> 00:27:18,743
I am not as dumb as I look see.

338
00:27:22,916 --> 00:27:23,581
Help!

339
00:27:23,531 --> 00:27:25,452
Look, Persians!

340
00:28:03,236 --> 00:28:04,458
I am a follower,

341
00:28:04,715 --> 00:28:06,757
God of the great king Xerxes,

342
00:28:07,007 --> 00:28:09,368
I came to accept,
You can surrender.

343
00:28:09,723 --> 00:28:11,667
Oh, we have not come to us to give.

344
00:28:16,151 --> 00:28:18,843
Xexes will enjoy that you
His slaves.

345
00:28:41,255 --> 00:28:46,299
Spartans!
Let us fight!

346
00:28:47,123 --> 00:28:49,208
Oh, we go hard stamp.

347
00:28:54,891 --> 00:28:57,895
We are Spartans,
We can stamp hard ...

348
00:28:58,691 --> 00:28:59,947
For us ...

349
00:29:00,351 --> 00:29:02,473
Because we stamp out loose!

350
00:29:04,721 --> 00:29:06,065
Oeh, oeh!

351
00:29:05,922 --> 00:29:08,717
Spartans! Yes!

352
00:29:13,299 --> 00:29:14,825
Persians!

353
00:29:15,663 --> 00:29:18,602
Let them try to see why we have
3 years internationally run!

354
00:29:18,848 --> 00:29:20,769
You guys are Cocks.

355
00:29:26,066 --> 00:29:27,883
Oh, come on!

356
00:29:28,075 --> 00:29:30,813
We love the Persian cuisine
We eat baklava ...

357
00:29:30,957 --> 00:29:33,785
We love kipburgers
And colored tartare.

358
00:29:33,977 --> 00:29:39,086
Oeh, ah ... Oeh, ah, Per ... oeh see!

359
00:29:50,475 --> 00:29:51,771
You need to shake with that ass!

360
00:29:51,893 --> 00:29:53,471
Let's get started!

361
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:31,186
Oh, please say!

362
00:31:37,367 --> 00:31:38,856
Oooh.

363
00:31:39,051 --> 00:31:40,590
Oee!

364
00:31:41,429 --> 00:31:43,013

00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:49,339
You need to shake with that ass!

367
00:32:10,622 --> 00:32:12,475
Your turn is over!

368
00:32:17,967 --> 00:32:19,038
Dancing with the Spartans.

369
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:35,176
Would you say that we have lost?
-- Dans you but otherwise at the bottom of the cliff.

370
00:32:38,939 --> 00:32:41,371
Come on man! Can we not talk about?
I know these idiots just pas!

371
00:33:15,907 --> 00:33:19,478
We then called the battle ...
But they win the war.

372
00:33:22,315 --> 00:33:25,154
Bud Meister presents:
True genius men!

373
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:32,937
Today we drink on you,

00:33:36,217 --> 00:33:41,375
Does nothing more than a learning onderbroek and keep.
You beat the enemy with all your oil hairless wonder.

375
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:47,474
Of course there is danger, brullende lions,
Tamping elephants,

376
00:33:47,602 --> 00:33:51,396
And a very nice little man named tok load-bearing, Cher!

377
00:33:51,892 --> 00:33:56,186
You have only had a date
But they will remember you forever.

378
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:04,724
Konings Your instinct says that you must wash,
Cut and cut with every man you see.

379
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:08,020
But enough now about your career
Kapster as ...

380
00:34:08,027 --> 00:34:09,532
Let's talk about the war.

381
00:34:11,505 --> 00:34:13,765
So this Bud's for you
King Leonidas!

382
00:34:14,521 --> 00:34:17,885
Because when it is difficult,
The stronger antiques.

383
00:34:18,388 --> 00:34:23,767
"Mr. war ringed homosexueel beard."

384
00:34:26,769 --> 00:34:29,152
Queen Margo,
We need to talk together.

385
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:33,378
Quieres, what do you want?

386
00:34:36,868 --> 00:34:38,404
Beautiful tomatoes!

387
00:34:39,135 --> 00:34:41,655
Your man you need.

388
00:34:42,835 --> 00:34:46,490
You must persuade the Chancellor to more men
To send your husband to support.

389
00:34:47,181 --> 00:34:48,766
My husband is dead,

390
00:34:48,918 --> 00:34:52,900
He said that I had to go further.
Anyway, I already have interest in J.B.

391
00:34:52,954 --> 00:34:55,742
A little to the right ...
There it is!

392
00:34:56,108 --> 00:34:58,849
If Leonidas loses,
And Xerxes are talking about,

393
00:34:59,006 --> 00:35:01,279
You are deprived of your crown.

394
00:35:01,844 --> 00:35:03,813
Stay am not Queen?

395
00:35:04,108 --> 00:35:05,294
Auw, that was too hard.

396
00:35:06,078 --> 00:35:07,503
You will get anything.

397
00:35:07,631 --> 00:35:09,104
The palace ...

398
00:35:10,821 --> 00:35:14,149
You Nintendo Wii ...
-- No, no, no! Ha!

399
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:16,672
Your 20 "rims of your escalade ...

400
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,253
And your gardener.

401
00:35:22,442 --> 00:35:23,355
Antonio?

402
00:35:39,506 --> 00:35:40,796
My husband asked me need ...

403
00:35:41,367 --> 00:35:42,895
I will do everything for,
Whatever it takes.

404
00:35:43,126 --> 00:35:44,872
I will make an appointment with the Kanseliers.

405
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:46,767
But in order to win their votes,

406
00:35:47,422 --> 00:35:49,943
You have the support of Treathero needed.

407
00:35:52,097 --> 00:35:55,636
He has a great influence on ...
The Kanseliers.

408
00:36:03,923 --> 00:36:06,902
King Leonidas,
Xerxes is aantocht!

409
00:36:08,423 --> 00:36:12,531
Xerxes! He seems as much at that
Fat guy from the movie of Borat.

410
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:23,291
I am the great God King Xerxes. Oeh!
-- Oeeehhh!

411
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:29,423
Auw, ue, ue!

412
00:36:30,885 --> 00:36:33,335
Auwww!

Damn!

414
00:36:53,334 --> 00:36:56,938
I am sorry, Xerxes.
-- It was Cool, it is good Cool, I have nothing ...

415
00:36:57,104 --> 00:36:58,520
That was my intention.

416
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:01,154
Oh, damn!

417
00:37:01,363 --> 00:37:02,893

00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:05,883
I come with a very large army,
To kebab of you to do.

419
00:37:06,535 --> 00:37:08,118
Before this battle is over,

420
00:37:08,641 --> 00:37:11,766
People will know that even
A God King could fall.

421
00:37:12,275 --> 00:37:14,684
Listen Leon, I come to talk with you.

422
00:37:15,007 --> 00:37:16,888

425
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:26,920
That will be for me.

426
00:37:28,315 --> 00:37:31,801
Hello! ... Really? Okay!

427
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:37,352
That was the bank.
They want to buy back your suitcase ...

For two persons,

In Las Vegas Nevada,

430
00:37:42,598 --> 00:37:44,173

And Sparta to me.

434
00:37:54,391 --> 00:37:57,117
Deal or no deal?

435
00:38:00,694 --> 00:38:03,189
Accept the deal!
-- No!

436
00:38:03,384 --> 00:38:05,559
Accept it now!

437
00:38:05,561 --> 00:38:06,690

As if you never have existed.

I will make sure that you,
From the history books.

446
00:38:31,569 --> 00:38:33,719
Well, I think this is all fine, Xerxes ...

447
00:38:35,223 --> 00:38:37,165
Because I can not read.

448
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:42,449
Xerxes was nothing more to say.
But ...

449
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:45,415
From every corner of his empire,

450
00:38:45,932 --> 00:38:48,379
Riep it is the most visual fighters on
Order for him to fight.

451
00:38:48,985 --> 00:38:53,373
Your mother is so vast, if they
Breast-feeding comes from oil.

452
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:01,507
Your mother is so dumb,
They thought 2Pac's rest home ...

453
00:39:01,425 --> 00:39:04,510
A Jewish holiday.

454
00:39:13,345 --> 00:39:14,691
Your mother is so thick,

455
00:39:14,905 --> 00:39:17,941
Its size is ... Uhm, uhm ... witch!
First, once waste!

456
00:39:20,323 --> 00:39:23,210
Your mother is a witch, even
Rosie O'Donnel wants no appointment with her.

457
00:39:23,831 --> 00:39:25,656
Oh, you did it!
No, you did not!

458
00:39:27,146 --> 00:39:29,480
Well, your mother tits,
His smaller than yours.

Your mother is so thick,

461
00:39:36,235 --> 00:39:40,286
That thousands of men say that they are not
Some fat ass. And then they lie.

00:39:43,769 --> 00:39:46,217
Auw, oh, my eyes!

463
00:39:49,212 --> 00:39:50,941

00:39:53,502 --> 00:39:55,929
Your mother is so thick, as it should poepen,

465
00:39:56,165 --> 00:39:58,623
Would Gore El her for the rioolprijs.

Yes, that may be so but,
Your mother is so hairy ...

467
00:40:05,562 --> 00:40:07,403
The only language they can ...

468
00:40:07,673 --> 00:40:10,954
Wokkie!
Brrrr! Brrrr!

469
00:40:25,071 --> 00:40:27,508
Xerxes watched how his army
Was defeated.

470
00:40:28,747 --> 00:40:31,614
It seemed as if every muscle
In his body froze.

471
00:40:32,901 --> 00:40:35,947
Or maybe it came by Dentyne lce
Kristalen with cool menthol.

472
00:40:44,783 --> 00:40:46,468
Lyness said that you wanted to see me.

473
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:50,987
That is my urine tester.

474
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,057
Yes, I do testing.

475
00:40:54,134 --> 00:40:56,041
Leonidas has more troops.

476
00:40:56,349 --> 00:40:59,341
Without their support will lose Sparta and ...

477
00:41:00,197 --> 00:41:02,118
Bla, bla, bla, bla.

478
00:41:11,152 --> 00:41:13,808
I will do everything ... For my husband,

479
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:16,958
Everything?

00:41:21,058 --> 00:41:24,372
It's crazy!
I am now really even buttocks!

481
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:26,521
Goodbye virginity.

482
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:29,304
I promise you,
That you will not enjoy.

483
00:41:29,769 --> 00:41:32,367
For 8 years I dream about certain ideas.

484
00:41:33,046 --> 00:41:35,398
That's okay!
I have already krabbetjes.

485
00:42:02,508 --> 00:42:08,438
Treason, dear Spartans,
And I give you everything that you go to calls.

486
00:42:08,678 --> 00:42:09,714

487
00:42:10,178 --> 00:42:11,475
Bend down to me!

488
00:42:13,886 --> 00:42:15,949
Bend down for the great God King,

489
00:42:16,329 --> 00:42:17,478
Xerxes.

490
00:42:18,083 --> 00:42:21,542
I am handicapped, I do not bend.
-- Ai!

491
00:42:22,243 --> 00:42:24,452
But, I want to look forward!
-- Yes!

492
00:42:24,578 --> 00:42:26,589
Good!
-- There is a secret passage,

493
00:42:27,155 --> 00:42:30,947
In Hot Gates,
You can completely encircle Leonidas.

494
00:42:34,703 --> 00:42:36,587
And how long you before?

495
00:42:37,041 --> 00:42:39,265
I want my plate is sponsored ...

496
00:42:39,699 --> 00:42:41,871
Oh, and I want these new Channel bag ...

Thank you ...
I wanted ... Something that was fun.

498
00:42:47,184 --> 00:42:48,539
If you have something to say,
Say it now,

499
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,732
I have to do more.

500
00:42:50,431 --> 00:42:52,555
What was it again ...

501
00:42:53,008 --> 00:42:54,590
Oh God, Jesus, yes!

502
00:42:54,728 --> 00:42:56,458
I want this puist disappears.

503
00:43:07,898 --> 00:43:10,203
Aaaaahh.

504
00:43:22,702 --> 00:43:25,973
While Xerxes the secret passage
Do not find in Hot Gates,

505
00:43:27,065 --> 00:43:30,051
Will their numbers are not queer.

506
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:33,066
My King!

507
00:43:35,698 --> 00:43:37,952
Come first breath ...
Give him a mix!

508
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:40,491
What's boy?

509
00:43:44,515 --> 00:43:47,297
Xerxes, the secret passage
Found in Hot Gates.

510
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:47,855
Oh, shit!

511
00:43:48,335 --> 00:43:49,404
I vervloek Paris Hilton.

512
00:43:50,003 --> 00:43:51,202
I hate her.

513
00:43:52,122 --> 00:43:54,996
Certainly a few thousand Persian soldiers.
Can any time here.

514
00:44:00,892 --> 00:44:04,835
Idilio ...
How great is it?

515
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:07,603
Oh, it's ...
It is but a scratch, my King.

516
00:44:12,474 --> 00:44:13,671
You have no eyes.

517
00:44:13,987 --> 00:44:15,590
The gods have blessed me and
There as a reserve.

518
00:44:16,256 --> 00:44:19,117
No, they have not,
You had only two.

519
00:44:20,133 --> 00:44:21,358
Jeremy has an eye as a reserve.

520
00:44:26,942 --> 00:44:28,479
But I can still fight.

521
00:44:29,993 --> 00:44:33,789
Ho, Idilio ... Idilio ...
Idilio!

522
00:44:34,105 --> 00:44:37,884
Idilio ... Idilio!
-- What? Walk with me.

523
00:44:39,562 --> 00:44:42,064
No, no, no, that direction.

524
00:44:44,597 --> 00:44:47,092
Your life is very important ...

525
00:44:49,917 --> 00:44:52,306
You must go back to Sparta,

526
00:44:52,226 --> 00:44:53,646
And tell our story.

527
00:44:54,314 --> 00:44:55,460
Yes, my King,

528
00:44:56,597 --> 00:44:58,616
Another message for the Queen?

529
00:45:10,867 --> 00:45:12,654
More you do not have to say.

530
00:45:13,626 --> 00:45:17,322
Now, Idilio. Let them know how
13 Spartans,

531
00:45:17,377 --> 00:45:18,486
Fighting for their honour ...

532
00:45:18,736 --> 00:45:20,026
For recognition ...

533
00:45:20,229 --> 00:45:24,402
And for freedom.
Good luck, Idilio.

534
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,850
Spartans!

535
00:45:50,964 --> 00:45:52,371
This is your last chance.

536
00:45:52,866 --> 00:45:55,451
I bend down,
Or you will die.

537
00:45:55,793 --> 00:45:58,382
I bend not for a man!

538
00:46:04,264 --> 00:46:06,020
Ga nou on your knees!
-- No!

539
00:46:07,466 --> 00:46:08,725
Go!
-- Enough!

540
00:46:11,931 --> 00:46:15,213
Well, you lacing is loose.
Oh, thank you.

541
00:46:15,908 --> 00:46:18,503
You see, it was really so difficult?
No, wait a minute!

542
00:46:18,472 --> 00:46:21,082
Attatatata! No, no.
-- I have not voted for you suffer, I have not voted for you suffer!

543
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:23,333
I was just on my laces!
-- No, no! Stop!

544
00:46:23,573 --> 00:46:26,122
You have recognized me as your God King.
Five Hi!

545
00:46:29,798 --> 00:46:30,999
What?

546
00:46:33,143 --> 00:46:34,730
What, what, what the devil is so funny?

547
00:46:34,918 --> 00:46:36,380
You!
-- Me?

548
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:38,277
You look like a woman.

549
00:46:38,617 --> 00:46:41,624
You idiots wear panties bananas,
And you laugh me out?

550
00:46:41,869 --> 00:46:44,411
Now you make me really angry.
I call on everyone.

551
00:46:45,537 --> 00:46:46,698
Hello, where are you?

552
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,006
I know where I am.

553
00:46:48,435 --> 00:46:49,765
Bring me my best army.

554
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:51,691
You, 13 small butts

555
00:46:51,904 --> 00:46:54,088
Are nothing compared with my
Best Persian army,

556
00:46:54,328 --> 00:46:55,682
That runs in the millions.

557
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:02,557
This is just a blue screen.

558
00:47:03,503 --> 00:47:05,835
Sounds crazy, that gives the visual effect,

559
00:47:06,133 --> 00:47:07,876
It is obvious you soon.

560
00:47:07,983 --> 00:47:10,722
The army is very impressive.
As you can see.

561
00:47:17,018 --> 00:47:19,903
Gentlemen, I present to you,
Queen Margo.

562
00:47:46,001 --> 00:47:47,018
Shake it, baby!

563
00:47:49,133 --> 00:47:51,146
Okay boys,
Let it rain!

564
00:48:09,588 --> 00:48:10,658
Well, Kanseliers ...

565
00:48:11,854 --> 00:48:13,070
I ask u. ..

566
00:48:14,018 --> 00:48:17,491
Your king ... My beloved husband,
, You need help.

567
00:48:17,582 --> 00:48:21,881
Sparta will be lost if you
Not the rest of the army transmitted.

568
00:48:34,756 --> 00:48:37,862
Gentlemen, our only hope for survival,
We submit to Xerxes,

569
00:48:38,236 --> 00:48:39,760
For him bend down and begging
That he can forgive us.

570
00:48:40,192 --> 00:48:41,988
Do not be seduced by the words
Te ...

571
00:48:42,744 --> 00:48:44,027
Icy slut!

572
00:48:46,169 --> 00:48:50,003
Oeh, have you not say.
-- Yes, yes, that I have said.

573
00:48:55,246 --> 00:48:57,885
Queen Margo brought a fantasy upwards.

574
00:49:01,071 --> 00:49:03,659
This seems obvious from Tobey Maguire Spiderman 3

575
00:49:14,303 --> 00:49:15,611
I am so bad!

576
00:49:20,731 --> 00:49:22,653
It was only sand! Oeh!

577
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:32,387
Oh, no!

578
00:49:41,423 --> 00:49:43,103
Oh, baby.

579
00:49:44,308 --> 00:49:45,412
Roosje yet!

580
00:49:55,547 --> 00:49:57,468
What is happening?

581
00:49:58,381 --> 00:50:01,887
Oh, oh, God, what filthy.

582
00:50:05,442 --> 00:50:07,730
How nice to find me now, zandman?

583
00:50:07,226 --> 00:50:09,147
Oh, no!

584
00:50:10,739 --> 00:50:13,078
You vacuum bitch, no!

585
00:50:18,321 --> 00:50:20,242
Neeeee.

586
00:50:34,451 --> 00:50:38,813
Kietel my nipples agree with a feather,
Xerxes is Treathero's top 5.

587
00:50:40,891 --> 00:50:43,087
Treathero was a traitor?

588
00:50:44,148 --> 00:50:45,204
Daaag ...

589
00:50:45,677 --> 00:50:47,377
Anyone for sending
More troops is ...

590
00:50:48,606 --> 00:50:51,780
Say then: Hi!
-- Hi, Hi, Hi, Hi.

591
00:51:16,051 --> 00:51:18,078
Spartans!
Huh!

592
00:51:20,547 --> 00:51:21,667
We have you surrounded,

593
00:51:21,986 --> 00:51:23,519
Lay down your weapons!

594
00:51:24,184 --> 00:51:27,205
Come get them.
-- In-formation!

595
00:51:33,874 --> 00:51:37,665
Uhm!
-- The Spartan boys protect others' backs.

596
00:51:42,928 --> 00:51:44,186
Is that just your sword boy ...

597
00:51:44,823 --> 00:51:46,365
In my back pricked?

598
00:51:48,664 --> 00:51:50,243
No, I did not hang my sword!

599
00:51:52,964 --> 00:51:54,119
Then go on.

600
00:51:54,641 --> 00:51:55,693
My son?

601
00:51:57,373 --> 00:52:00,350
Today you are a real Spartaan.

602
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:01,579
Thank you father.

603
00:52:03,759 --> 00:52:05,035
Attacks!

604
00:52:07,955 --> 00:52:09,396
Stay, Spartans.

605
00:52:19,793 --> 00:52:21,658
Remember this day boys ...

606
00:52:22,274 --> 00:52:24,920
Because today is the day
You will die.

607
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:28,564
What?

608
00:52:28,666 --> 00:52:31,588
I, I mean that they will die.
Today is the day that they die.

609
00:52:31,585 --> 00:52:33,025
That was what I meant to say.

610
00:52:35,926 --> 00:52:37,079
Go for it!

611
00:52:50,831 --> 00:52:53,203
Oh, what a bunch of idiots!

612
00:52:55,970 --> 00:52:57,087
God, what are they smart say!

613
00:52:57,112 --> 00:53:00,281
Hercules comes in me up,
And I address you now.

614
00:54:25,173 --> 00:54:26,715
Ghost Rider!

615
00:54:30,148 --> 00:54:32,049
You go to hell.

616
00:54:34,025 --> 00:54:36,474
Sterfffff.

617
00:54:42,704 --> 00:54:45,297
I stop your war!
I stop your war!

618
00:54:58,235 --> 00:55:00,156
JO!

619
00:55:01,088 --> 00:55:02,113
"ROCKY"

620
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:14,431
No!
-- Jo, Sonio?

621
00:55:15,853 --> 00:55:18,696
I nok your head off!
-- Oh, shit!

622
00:55:20,293 --> 00:55:22,214
Sonio!

623
00:55:34,888 --> 00:55:37,108
You will here for a penalty, Balboa.

624
00:55:37,236 --> 00:55:38,295
Go for it!

625
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,176
Luiers for adults?

626
00:55:58,736 --> 00:56:00,175
"BOTOX"

627
00:56:12,742 --> 00:56:16,079
Botox, for adults!

628
00:56:23,789 --> 00:56:25,990
Yes!

629
00:56:26,584 --> 00:56:28,505
Yes!
Ha, ha!

630
00:56:29,517 --> 00:56:30,670
Yes!

631
00:56:36,939 --> 00:56:38,091
Yes!

632
00:56:42,632 --> 00:56:44,477
Xerxes!

633
00:56:54,817 --> 00:56:57,627
It is ... ... Beautiful day.

634
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:02,476
He is not attractive SUN.

635
00:57:33,085 --> 00:57:34,861
Come on Barbie,
Let's go celebrate.

636
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:51,306
Oeh!

637
00:57:52,397 --> 00:57:53,502
Hmm.

638
00:57:57,505 --> 00:57:59,234
"SanAndreas"

639
00:58:02,421 --> 00:58:03,377
Shit!

640
00:58:10,857 --> 00:58:13,273
It's enough with that
Dumb violent video games.

641
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:44,745
Ah, the transformeer cube.

642
00:58:53,931 --> 00:58:56,007
Okay baby,
Let's go transform.

643
00:59:28,923 --> 00:59:35,259
I am Xerxessterk, which is due
Alien invention of this technique.

644
00:59:39,209 --> 00:59:41,255
Let Buddy alone!

645
00:59:41,861 --> 00:59:44,850
He is a God King ...
-- Please!

646
00:59:52,602 --> 00:59:54,523
Leave him alone!

647
00:59:57,645 --> 00:59:59,281
Oh, Die inventors technique.

648
01:00:07,256 --> 01:00:09,211
Leonidas words were actually ...

649
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:11,363
A God King has been dropped,

650
01:00:11,789 --> 01:00:13,574
But alas!
Well on top of them.

651
01:00:34,344 --> 01:00:36,024
I, I must ...

652
01:00:38,610 --> 01:00:39,715
Oooh ...

653
01:00:41,704 --> 01:00:43,048
Oeh ...
Pfff!

654
01:00:43,933 --> 01:00:46,270
Queen Margo?
-- Yes!

655
01:01:09,543 --> 01:01:11,251
Leonidas and the Spartans,

656
01:01:11,564 --> 01:01:12,946
Deaths for their honour,

657
01:01:13,885 --> 01:01:15,338
For recognition.

658
01:01:16,777 --> 01:01:17,964
They are ...

659
01:01:18,157 --> 01:01:19,728
A beautiful death died.

660
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:28,492
"1 year later"
Today, we stand in front of 30 thousand perzi?s

661
01:01:31,296 --> 01:01:34,582
But we have now,
100 thousand soldiers!

662
01:01:34,931 --> 01:01:36,852
Ahuh, huh, huh ...

663
01:01:37,798 --> 01:01:38,816
On the victory.

664
01:01:48,339 --> 01:01:50,941
Ah!
Follow me boys!

665
01:01:54,465 --> 01:01:58,780
And that led, the blindness of Idilio
100 thousand Spartans away from the Perzi?s ...

666
01:01:59,636 --> 01:02:02,010
To Mallibu ...

667
01:02:02,623 --> 01:02:06,733
Just at that moment was Lindsay Lowhand
The rehabilitation center. Again!

668
01:02:20,036 --> 01:02:21,892
At first I was scared,

669
01:02:22,003 --> 01:02:23,454
I was paralysed.

670
01:02:23,966 --> 01:02:27,062
Did that I would not be able to live
Without you at my side

671
01:02:27,647 --> 01:02:31,288
But when I sit nights thinking
I do not how many times you had to sit.

672
01:02:31,498 --> 01:02:33,141
And I was stronger.

673
01:02:33,122 --> 01:02:34,880
And I learned how I could go

674
01:02:35,317 --> 01:02:36,763
And now you are back,

675
01:02:36,950 --> 01:02:38,329
From space.

676
