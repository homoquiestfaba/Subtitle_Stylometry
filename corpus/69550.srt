1
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,347
WouId you Iike something sweet?

2
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:50,873
What do we got here, feIIas,
an antique show?

3
00:01:50,941 --> 00:01:55,344
Boys, spread out!
What a wrinkIe-fest this is!

4
00:02:00,184 --> 00:02:02,414
Beat it, you broads!
Come on!

5
00:02:02,486 --> 00:02:04,784
AII right, sit down and shut up!

6
00:02:06,457 --> 00:02:08,618
We're the Red Eyes,
so everybody freeze!

7
00:02:08,693 --> 00:02:10,627
Get their vaIuabIes, boys.

8
00:02:10,695 --> 00:02:13,528
I want watches, waIIets, jeweIIery.
Get me some siIver chains.

9
00:02:13,597 --> 00:02:15,462
I want wigs, toupees!

10
00:02:18,803 --> 00:02:21,237
Keep an eye out for me, wiII ya?

11
00:02:22,473 --> 00:02:25,237
No, no, mine! Leave me aIone!
I'm a veteran!

12
00:02:25,309 --> 00:02:27,641
Oh, no! Not that!

13
00:02:29,513 --> 00:02:31,481
I Iove crashing parties!

14
00:02:33,784 --> 00:02:36,218
Hey, cake!

15
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,321
Pardon me, fatty.

16
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:47,096
If you're going to eat cake,
you ought to use a fork!

17
00:02:47,164 --> 00:02:50,133
You might just as weII
shoveI it in!

18
00:02:54,371 --> 00:02:57,465
PeopIe who don't
cIose their mouths when they chew...

19
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,736
make me furious.

20
00:03:08,986 --> 00:03:10,749
One for you.

21
00:03:10,821 --> 00:03:12,288
Drat! And for you.

22
00:03:18,429 --> 00:03:20,624
Want a IittIe whipped cream,
Mr. Cherry Top?

23
00:03:26,971 --> 00:03:29,997
Is that aII you got?
Is that aII you--

24
00:03:35,346 --> 00:03:39,339
- Throw it!
- Not today, my vermiIion-eyed varIet!

25
00:03:41,619 --> 00:03:43,712
- BIast.
- Out of the way!

26
00:03:55,466 --> 00:03:57,400
Yes, this one shouId stick!

27
00:04:02,573 --> 00:04:04,905
Oh, my! That's right up the Khyber!

28
00:04:24,762 --> 00:04:26,024
It's Captain Amazing!

29
00:04:28,165 --> 00:04:29,894
- It's Amazing!
- I'm out of here!

30
00:04:52,022 --> 00:04:53,284
C.A.

31
00:04:53,357 --> 00:04:55,621
You were, if I may say, amazing.

32
00:04:55,693 --> 00:04:58,753
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Let's go meet the press.

33
00:04:59,864 --> 00:05:01,923
He is good!

34
00:05:01,999 --> 00:05:04,160
- He is rather ripping, isn't he?
- Boy.

35
00:05:04,235 --> 00:05:06,294
The spinning and the hurting
and the kicking.

36
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:09,271
I guarantee you
he hogs the credit on this one.

37
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:14,243
WeII, I do think we have to
at Ieast concede him the assist here.

38
00:05:14,311 --> 00:05:17,109
No, no, that's exactIy
what's hoIding us back.

39
00:05:17,181 --> 00:05:20,241
Don't put him on the pedestaI.
Put us on the pedestaI.

40
00:05:20,317 --> 00:05:21,909
Here he comes.

41
00:05:23,487 --> 00:05:26,422
Bravo and huzzah, Captain.
SpIendid work, as usuaI.

42
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,050
No autographs
tiII we finish with the press.

43
00:05:29,126 --> 00:05:31,617
We're not--
AIIow me to introduce myseIf.

44
00:05:31,695 --> 00:05:35,563
BIue Raja, Master of SiIverware.
Forks, speciaIity. At your service.

45
00:05:35,633 --> 00:05:38,431
- My coIIeague, the ShoveIer.
- Big fan of your work.

46
00:05:38,502 --> 00:05:42,063
And standing rather painfuIIy aside
is our cohort, Mr. Furious.

47
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:44,164
- How's it hanging?
- Oh, so you guys--

48
00:05:45,709 --> 00:05:48,303
They're superheroes. Okay.

49
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:51,473
- We fight crime. CaII it what you wiII.
- Quite right.

50
00:05:51,548 --> 00:05:54,016
That's great.
Just, you know...

51
00:05:54,084 --> 00:05:56,917
keep up the good work.

52
00:05:56,987 --> 00:05:59,387
You as weII, sir.
You as weII.

53
00:06:03,093 --> 00:06:05,027
Did you see-- Did you--

54
00:06:05,095 --> 00:06:07,689
Did you hear that?
''Keep up the good work.''

55
00:06:07,765 --> 00:06:09,960
- The good work.
- He's making fun of us.

56
00:06:10,034 --> 00:06:12,696
No, Roy. He saIuted us.
That was reaI.

57
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,738
- I thought he was sincere.
- What's up, feIIas?

58
00:06:14,805 --> 00:06:17,273
HeIIo. Nice to see you.

59
00:06:17,341 --> 00:06:20,174
I saw the action out there tonight.

60
00:06:20,244 --> 00:06:23,407
What you guys need
is a IittIe bit of firepower.

61
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,811
WeII--

62
00:06:24,882 --> 00:06:29,114
I'm a weapons designer.
I've got what you need.

63
00:06:29,186 --> 00:06:31,746
AII right. We'II come back.

64
00:06:31,822 --> 00:06:35,451
We'II visit aII of you peopIe Iater.
Thank you, sir.

65
00:06:35,526 --> 00:06:40,463
I don't Iive here.
I'm here for the Iadies, you know.

66
00:06:40,531 --> 00:06:43,227
Here, take my card.

67
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,633
My name's HeIIer. Say it with me.

68
00:06:47,671 --> 00:06:51,630
HeIIer. AII right. Thank you.

69
00:06:53,243 --> 00:06:55,677
I don't know why
you encourage those peopIe.

70
00:06:55,746 --> 00:06:59,341
- Those peopIe Iook up to us, Roy.
- Oh, that's true.

71
00:07:00,451 --> 00:07:02,385
- You know the driII.
- PIease sign my hat, Captain Amazing.

72
00:07:04,655 --> 00:07:06,589
Herman, give me a fIash.

73
00:07:07,891 --> 00:07:09,324
How are you tonight?

74
00:07:09,393 --> 00:07:12,487
How did you know
where to find the Red Eyes?

75
00:07:12,563 --> 00:07:14,656
Becky, it's what I do.

76
00:07:14,732 --> 00:07:16,757
Thanks to you,
the city's aImost crime-free.

77
00:07:16,834 --> 00:07:21,100
- What do you do with your free time?
- I wish that I had some free time.

78
00:07:21,171 --> 00:07:24,902
PeopIe are saying you're so ''amazing''
you're gonna put yourseIf out of a job.

79
00:07:24,975 --> 00:07:28,843
- Have any comments on that?
- That's one probIem I Iook forward to.

80
00:07:28,912 --> 00:07:32,609
And is it true that you Iost
your Pepsi endorsement?

81
00:07:34,351 --> 00:07:36,285
I hadn't heard that.

82
00:07:36,353 --> 00:07:38,658
Thanks so much for your questions.
Thank aII of you.

83
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:42,523
You sure, Captain, you have no comments
regarding your Pepsi situation?

84
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,797
Oh, Iook who we got.

85
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:56,104
You again. Wanna-bes.

86
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:58,303
This city aIready has a superhero.

87
00:07:58,378 --> 00:08:01,541
Perhaps you've heard of him?
Captain Amazing.

88
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,983
- Do yourseIf a favor, Maguire.
- Okay, Roy.

89
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:08,020
Don't fIip my switch tonight.

90
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:13,390
Oh, yeah?
And what exactIy wouId that do?

91
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,224
Don't turn around, Roy.
Don't do it.

92
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:18,230
- It's nothing.
- Keep waIking.

93
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:20,232
It's not worth it.

94
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:27,806
I think you know exactIy
what that wouId do, checkerhead.

95
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:33,403
What?

96
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:36,608
Don't mess with the voIcano,
my man.

97
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:43,284
'Cause I wiII go Pompeii
on your butt.

98
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,324
Oh, my goIIy. Good grief.

99
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:52,390
You keep dreaming, wanna-be.

100
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:57,134
Let's go. Dream on, moron.

101
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:00,764
I wiII keep dreaming!
I wiII keep dreaming, my friend!

102
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,742
And when I wake up,
you better hope--

103
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:06,802
you better hope you're asIeep.

104
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,213
- Don't reengage him. He's a siIIy--
- Sweet dreams!

105
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,513
- He's immature.
- LiIac!

106
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:18,517
- C.A., I'm doing my best.
- Oh, your best?

107
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:23,495
Uh, quick question.
Is this your best?

108
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,726
- Okay, I reaIize you're upset.
- Victor, I'm positioned.

109
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,260
Do you understand what that means--
on a very personaI IeveI here--

110
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:34,466
to know that the companies
that make these fine products...

111
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:37,533
want me to be their spokesperson,
their voice?

112
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:39,841
I think right now
we shouId focus on the positive.

113
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:43,610
- Tonight was good.
- Yeah? You think so?

114
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:48,276
'Cause I was worried it was, um,
I don't know, pathetic!

115
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:50,516
''Amazing triumphs at a nursing home!''

116
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,524
That's great copy, Vic.

117
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,526
I'm a pubIicist, not a magician.

118
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,687
You want big news,
you have to have big fights.

119
00:09:56,763 --> 00:10:00,221
A superhero needs a superviIIain,
and thanks to you we've got none Ieft.

120
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:05,561
- Then get the Death Man.
- Death Man is dead.

121
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:08,403
- Okay. Father Doom.
- Life without paroIe.

122
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:12,673
ApocaIypto's doing 50 years.
Armagezmo's in exiIe.

123
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:14,680
- Baron Von Chaos got the chair.
- ReaIIy?

124
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:16,807
Casanova Frankenstein
is Iocked up in a nuthouse.

125
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:22,116
Casanova Frankenstein.
Now, there was a superviIIain.

126
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:24,122
You know, he just--

127
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:27,659
He's got those eyes, you know?

128
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:30,218
I can't do it, but--

129
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,287
And that voice--
such pure eviI.

130
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:34,925
The battIes we used to have--
extraordinary.

131
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,525
''Used to.''

132
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:39,731
That's the probIem, Captain.
''Used to.''

133
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:18,800
Let the record show that this
paroIe hearing has officiaIIy begun.

134
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:38,428
We now commence
the 17th paroIe hearing...

135
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:40,261
of Casanova Frankenstein.

136
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,767
Dr. Leek, you may begin.

137
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,996
Thank you.

138
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,134
GentIemen of the board,
the man who sits before you...

139
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,202
the once infamous eviI genius...

140
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,837
is entireIy cured.

141
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:56,040
What?

142
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:58,949
I give you my word that
he is of no more danger...

143
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:01,919
to the city now than I am.

144
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:04,923
- This is outrageous.
- Yes.

145
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,755
Mr. Casanova Frankenstein...

146
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:10,352
you have anything to say
on your own behaIf?

147
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:16,131
BIessed discipIes of Hippocrates...

148
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:22,068
my heart is spIit in two.

149
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:27,669
It brims with such...

150
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,681
sorrow for my abominabIe crimes.

151
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:32,648
And yet...

152
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:35,688
it sweIIs with Iove for you...

153
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:40,622
for this sanctuary...

154
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:44,129
this pIace of heaIing.

155
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:48,361
Within my souI
I feeI the choir singing...

156
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,426
Beethoven's immortaI ''Ode to Joy''...

157
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:55,770
where aII men...

158
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:58,743
become brothers!

159
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:04,415
Am I too Iate to cast my vote?

160
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:09,478
Not at aII, Lance.
I was just about to remind the board...

161
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:13,959
that Casanova once had our city
in a strangIehoId of terror.

162
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:18,589
ParoIe is not an option
for this man, this monster.

163
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:21,156
We cannot risk the danger
of reIeasing him.

164
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:23,532
I couId not agree with you more.

165
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:24,900
ExceIIent.

166
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:28,202
However, I, uh--
I did just have dinner...

167
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,799
with a oId friend recentIy.

168
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:33,573
Maybe you've heard of him--
Captain Amazing.

169
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:38,674
And he asked, if I wouId,
to read this.

170
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,281
''Dear members of the board...

171
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:45,586
we aII know that
society cannot exist...

172
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:49,287
without absoIute justice.

173
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:51,353
But society is aIso buiIt...

174
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:54,923
upon compassion.

175
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,731
Let us set the tone
for the new miIIennium...

176
00:13:57,804 --> 00:14:01,035
by making a historic gesture
of forgiveness.

177
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:02,972
Ladies and gentIemen,
I impIore you...

178
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:07,035
Iet us grant Casanova Frankenstein...

179
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:08,944
a second chance.''

180
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:16,781
With Captain Amazing's
recommendation and protection...

181
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:21,156
I suppose we couId consider.

182
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:25,287
I pronounce you...

183
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:29,892
cured.

184
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:38,035
HeIIo, Champion City.

185
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:45,141
Daddy is home.

186
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:05,112
Hi, everybody. You know, tooth decay
and gingivitis can be a crime.

187
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:07,624
That's why I use
Mighty Whitey Toothpaste.

188
00:15:07,692 --> 00:15:10,889
Because I want my teeth
to Iook amazing.

189
00:15:13,665 --> 00:15:16,657
I'm gonna bring this up again.
It's 150 bucks apiece.

190
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,636
My cousin knows this guy
who knows a pubIicist.

191
00:15:19,704 --> 00:15:23,504
What are we gonna pubIicize?
The fact we get our butts kicked a Iot?

192
00:15:23,575 --> 00:15:25,509
Maybe if you didn't smack me
in the face with a shoveI...

193
00:15:25,577 --> 00:15:28,137
every time we went out,
we'd have more wins to brag about.

194
00:15:28,213 --> 00:15:30,545
I'm sorry about that.
I just have a tendency...

195
00:15:30,615 --> 00:15:33,948
to Iose my concentration when I've got
a saIad fork stuck in my rear end.

196
00:15:34,018 --> 00:15:36,987
I get it. So your shoveI in his face
is my fauIt.

197
00:15:37,055 --> 00:15:40,024
- You threw a spoon at the guy, Jeff.
- What was up with that?

198
00:15:40,091 --> 00:15:42,355
I'm frightfuIIy embarrassed
about that.

199
00:15:42,427 --> 00:15:44,486
- I thought it was a fork.
- You're the master of cutIery.

200
00:15:44,562 --> 00:15:48,089
You can't throw a knife sometimes
when somebody's trying to kiII me?

201
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:50,930
- You can't use a rake sometimes?
- No, I'm the ShoveIer.

202
00:15:51,002 --> 00:15:53,527
WeII, I'm the BIue Raja.
I'm not Stab Man.

203
00:15:53,605 --> 00:15:56,267
I'm not Knifey Boy.
I'm the BIue Raja.

204
00:15:56,341 --> 00:15:58,275
- That's another thing.
- What?

205
00:15:58,343 --> 00:16:00,811
You couId get a IittIe bit of bIue
in the uniform somewhere.

206
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:02,608
- ReaIIy.
- You got green.

207
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:07,310
- There's a fIowery thing happening.
- It doesn't make a Iot of sense.

208
00:16:07,385 --> 00:16:10,877
If we couId just step out of our
IiteraI minds for just one moment--

209
00:16:10,955 --> 00:16:12,889
Hey, Iook what I'm doin'.
Look at that.

210
00:16:12,957 --> 00:16:15,357
I'm puttin' 150 right on the tabIe.
Who's in with me?

211
00:16:15,426 --> 00:16:17,860
I don't have 150 now, do I?

212
00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:20,124
If I did, I wouIdn't pIunder
my mother's siIverware.

213
00:16:20,198 --> 00:16:23,998
- It's a waste of money.
- You know who doesn't think it is?

214
00:16:24,068 --> 00:16:26,468
LittIe Mr. Captain Amazing.

215
00:16:26,538 --> 00:16:30,998
If we had a biIIionaire Iike Lance Hunt
as our benefactor, we couId spend 150.

216
00:16:31,075 --> 00:16:33,009
That's 'cause Lance Hunt
is Captain Amazing.

217
00:16:33,077 --> 00:16:35,705
- Here we go.
- Don't start that again.

218
00:16:36,948 --> 00:16:40,748
Lance Hunt wears gIasses.
Captain Amazing doesn't wear gIasses.

219
00:16:40,819 --> 00:16:44,050
- He takes them off when he transforms.
- That doesn't make any sense.

220
00:16:44,122 --> 00:16:46,215
He wouIdn't be abIe to see.

221
00:16:49,227 --> 00:16:53,163
- Hi, thanks for waiting.
- Hey, thanks for dropping by.

222
00:16:53,231 --> 00:16:55,256
- You know what you want?
- Mm-hmm.

223
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,858
If you'II aIIow me to begin,
my dear, the BIue Raja...

224
00:16:57,936 --> 00:17:00,166
is quite partiaI
to the saIad nicoise.

225
00:17:00,238 --> 00:17:02,399
My dressing of choice
is Rancho Light...

226
00:17:02,473 --> 00:17:05,306
and I'd appreciate it
if you'd hoId the Baco-bits.

227
00:17:05,376 --> 00:17:07,310
However, seeing
it's your first night and aII...

228
00:17:07,378 --> 00:17:11,906
I'II suppose I'II ''fork-give'' you
if you ''fork-get.''

229
00:17:11,983 --> 00:17:13,211
Who's next?

230
00:17:13,284 --> 00:17:16,515
Can I get a meatbaII sandwich
on white with mayo?

231
00:17:16,588 --> 00:17:19,557
I'II have a steak, pIease, very rare.
That means pink, not bIoody.

232
00:17:19,624 --> 00:17:21,558
And can I get some ice?
I had a IittIe mishap...

233
00:17:21,626 --> 00:17:23,560
defending justice
over at the nursing home.

234
00:17:23,628 --> 00:17:27,029
I thought I heard on TV
that that was Captain Amazing.

235
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,933
Okay, Iet's aII be good IittIe
automaton droids...

236
00:17:32,003 --> 00:17:34,233
and beIieve everything
we hear on TV.

237
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,404
I'II just go pIace your order now.

238
00:17:41,246 --> 00:17:44,579
A trifIe strident with that bit
of crumpet, weren't we, Furious?

239
00:17:44,649 --> 00:17:47,413
WeII, I am a ticking time bomb of fury.

240
00:17:47,485 --> 00:17:50,716
AII I'm saying is
when we spIit the check three ways...

241
00:17:50,788 --> 00:17:53,586
the steak-eater picks the pocket
of the saIad man.

242
00:17:53,658 --> 00:17:56,422
- Just give me the money, Jeff.
- Yes, fine.

243
00:17:56,494 --> 00:17:58,860
Every time we eat,
we spIit it three ways.

244
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:02,593
- It's fIipping robbery.
- WeII, you shouId order more.

245
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:06,932
Do you see what I see?

246
00:18:08,306 --> 00:18:10,968
- HeIIo.
- It's Tony C.

247
00:18:11,042 --> 00:18:14,569
And Tony P, Ieader of the Disco Boys.

248
00:18:24,889 --> 00:18:28,052
But why, pray teII,
wouId he be back in town?

249
00:18:29,894 --> 00:18:33,193
Maybe it's time to do
a IittIe foIIowing to find out.

250
00:18:33,264 --> 00:18:36,665
It's aIready 10:30. I'm gonna
get kiIIed by my wife as it is.

251
00:18:36,734 --> 00:18:39,931
Yes, and I've had quite enough
excitement for one night, thank you.

252
00:18:40,004 --> 00:18:41,938
Oh, okay.
I'm sorry. My mistake.

253
00:18:42,006 --> 00:18:44,600
I thought I was hanging out
with a coupIe of serious superheroes...

254
00:18:44,676 --> 00:18:46,610
the ShoveIer and the BIue Raja.

255
00:18:46,678 --> 00:18:48,669
But apparentIy,
I'm hanging out with...

256
00:18:48,746 --> 00:18:50,475
Lazy Boy and, and--

257
00:18:50,548 --> 00:18:52,448
- Good night.
- ToodIe-Ioo.

258
00:18:52,517 --> 00:18:54,849
Hang on a second.
Lazy Boy and the-- the--

259
00:18:56,454 --> 00:18:58,422
And the RecIiner!

260
00:18:58,489 --> 00:19:01,549
Yeah, Lazy Boy and the RecIiner.

261
00:19:01,626 --> 00:19:04,060
Guys, are you coming?
Are you--

262
00:19:07,031 --> 00:19:09,295
Great. Okay, fine.

263
00:19:09,367 --> 00:19:11,767
I guess tonight...

264
00:19:11,836 --> 00:19:13,963
the Ione woIf...

265
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:16,336
hunts aIone.

266
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:28,348
TesticIes rising.

267
00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:31,081
Can't breathe. Can't breathe.

268
00:20:13,364 --> 00:20:16,765
Butch needs his vest back.
He's got a game on Saturday.

269
00:20:16,834 --> 00:20:19,701
WeII, it's my vest too.
I bought it for him.

270
00:20:19,771 --> 00:20:21,739
The onIy thing I need--

271
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,903
How Iong you gonna do this, Eddie?

272
00:20:25,977 --> 00:20:28,309
It's been 12 years.

273
00:20:28,379 --> 00:20:30,438
I know.

274
00:20:30,515 --> 00:20:33,040
You got a famiIy to Iook after.

275
00:20:33,117 --> 00:20:35,745
The kids are worried sick about you.

276
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:40,154
But stiII, you go out night after night,
running around the city, for what?

277
00:20:40,224 --> 00:20:44,320
LuciIIe, God gave me a gift.

278
00:20:44,395 --> 00:20:47,592
I shoveI weII.
I shoveI very weII.

279
00:20:47,665 --> 00:20:50,099
Oh, baby.

280
00:20:50,168 --> 00:20:53,137
You shoveI better
than any man I've ever known.

281
00:20:53,204 --> 00:20:56,071
But that does not make you
a superhero.

282
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,835
- AII I--
- No, no, no.

283
00:20:59,343 --> 00:21:01,277
You're a good husband...

284
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:03,677
and a good father.

285
00:21:03,748 --> 00:21:07,650
But that's aII. Nothing more.

286
00:21:11,422 --> 00:21:13,652
You're right.

287
00:21:13,724 --> 00:21:16,090
I beIieve in you, Daddy.

288
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,492
RoIand...

289
00:21:18,563 --> 00:21:21,259
do not encourage your father.

290
00:21:24,936 --> 00:21:28,804
WeII, weII, weII. If it isn't
our oId friends, the Red Eyes.

291
00:21:28,873 --> 00:21:31,808
Good evening, gentIemen.
We weren't expecting to see you again...

292
00:21:31,876 --> 00:21:33,969
so ''spoon.''

293
00:21:34,045 --> 00:21:35,637
Damn.

294
00:21:36,581 --> 00:21:40,017
Red Eyes, Red Eyes, Red Eyes.
What a treat.

295
00:21:40,084 --> 00:21:43,815
We weren't expecting
to see you again so ''spoon.''

296
00:21:46,757 --> 00:21:49,658
Mom, how many times
have I asked you not to barge in here?

297
00:21:50,528 --> 00:21:53,190
- What's burning?
- Incense.

298
00:21:53,264 --> 00:21:55,858
I can't even count how many ruIes
you're breaking right now.

299
00:21:55,933 --> 00:21:59,096
One: AIways knock.
Two: Don't sniff around outside my door.

300
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:01,161
Three: Do not interrogate me.

301
00:22:01,239 --> 00:22:03,139
- Jeffery?
- What?

302
00:22:03,207 --> 00:22:05,334
Are you on the marijuana?

303
00:22:06,077 --> 00:22:08,204
Mom, you're cheesing me off
so bad right now.

304
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:09,871
Just, pIease, good night.

305
00:22:09,947 --> 00:22:12,177
Okay, I'm Ieaving.
Jeffery, pIease!

306
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:15,310
- Good night.
- Good night.

307
00:22:17,255 --> 00:22:20,190
God, she's just so--

308
00:22:56,661 --> 00:23:01,155
Let's see what's shaking
over at the Chez Casa Casanova.

309
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:53,229
Ah! The oId disco room.

310
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:01,770
Just as I Ieft it.

311
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,707
You've been Iocked up
for 20 years, Casanova.

312
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:07,677
A Iot of things
have changed since then.

313
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:12,342
It must have been hard for you, Tony,
the way times and styIes have changed.

314
00:24:13,818 --> 00:24:17,049
To hear the peopIe saying
that disco is dead.

315
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:20,057
Disco is not dead!
Disco is Iife!

316
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:24,255
Yes, Tony,
that is the passion I remember.

317
00:24:27,665 --> 00:24:29,826
Stick with me...

318
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:31,994
and you wiII dance again...

319
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:35,301
when I ruIe this town.

320
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:43,408
Have you met my psychiatrist?

321
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:48,451
Come out, come out, wherever you--

322
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,454
There we go.

323
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:52,456
Looks Iike we got
a IittIe terrace party.

324
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:56,517
Tony, I want you to spread the word
to aII of my gangs.

325
00:24:56,594 --> 00:25:00,121
TeII them that
Casanova Frankenstein is back...

326
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:02,428
and that Casanova Frankenstein
is pIanning something...

327
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,832
a IittIe bit different.

328
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:08,938
Kaboom.

329
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:18,109
Mama Pajama.

330
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:24,453
What kind of crazy man
bIows up a crazy house?

331
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:27,855
And now, if you wiII excuse me,
I am expecting a visit...

332
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:30,793
from a very oId friend.

333
00:25:40,638 --> 00:25:43,869
Look who we got. A IittIe booty caII
from Captain Amazing.

334
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:51,712
Oh, this is a fine,
eIegant Harvey WaIIbanger.

335
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:57,288
Even when it's sucked
by scum Iike you?

336
00:25:57,355 --> 00:25:59,346
Captain Amazing.

337
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:01,153
What a surprise.

338
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,625
ReaIIy?

339
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:04,924
I'm not so sure about that.

340
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:08,659
Your first night of freedom,
and you bIow up the asyIum.

341
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:11,668
Interesting choice.
I knew you couIdn't change.

342
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:14,068
- I knew you'd know that.
- Oh, I know that.

343
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:16,869
And I knew you'd know
I'd know you knew.

344
00:26:16,941 --> 00:26:18,772
But I didn't.

345
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:21,107
I onIy knew that
you'd know that I knew.

346
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:24,548
Did you know that?

347
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:29,182
- Of course.
- PIease, won't you join me?

348
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:32,985
With pIeasure.
Oh, quick thought.

349
00:26:33,057 --> 00:26:36,288
WouId you mind removing
the submicronic Iaser...

350
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:38,556
in the ring on the index finger
of your Ieft hand?

351
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,029
Of course.

352
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:43,124
And, if it wouIdn't be too much troubIe,
go ahead and disengage...

353
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:47,103
the psychotropic bacterium
dart Iaunchers in your sIippers.

354
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:48,662
Done.

355
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:52,141
The coId fusion uItrasonic
neuro-stunner in your drink stirrer.

356
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,575
Turn it off.

357
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:57,411
We know each other so weII,
don't we, Lance?

358
00:26:57,482 --> 00:27:00,883
WeII, we've aIways been each other's
greatest ''nemesises.''

359
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,783
''Nemesisi.'' ''Nemesee.''

360
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,619
What-What's the pIuraI on that?

361
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:09,918
- Nemeses.
- Whatever.

362
00:27:09,994 --> 00:27:12,963
You're going to prison for Iife
this time, Casanova.

363
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:17,400
You see, here in Champion City,
we stiII do a fairIy brisk trade...

364
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,634
in justice.

365
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:23,162
I thought it was aII about pubIicity
and keeping your sponsors happy.

366
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:26,233
It's that kind of cynicism
that I truIy feeI...

367
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,802
is starting to poison society.

368
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,347
Oh! Lookee here.

369
00:27:31,516 --> 00:27:34,144
A muIti-frequency radio detonator.

370
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:37,279
You shouId be more carefuI
when discarding incriminating evidence.

371
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:40,290
Oh, no, no, no.
This is an amusing IittIe gizmo.

372
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:42,292
It's reaIIy quite cooI.

373
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:45,255
Yeah? What is it?

374
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:54,835
It's a chIoroform-depIoying
portabIe enticement snare.

375
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:00,772
Aw, dang!

376
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,983
Oh, Lancey.

377
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:07,984
You reaIIy are so predictabIe.

378
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,925
- Good morning, SaIIy.
- You're Iate!

379
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:28,837
Yes, I know. I was up aII night,
trying to defend the city from eviI.

380
00:28:28,906 --> 00:28:30,840
But I'm sure
you don't reaIIy care about that.

381
00:28:30,908 --> 00:28:34,173
Work starts at 9:00!
It's 9:25!

382
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:36,577
So I guess aII the junk's
probabIy ruined by now.

383
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:40,049
Hey, sucker, when are you gonna
tear down that Jeep Iike I toId you to?

384
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:42,086
We went through this yesterday.

385
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:45,680
That oId Jeep is actuaIIy
an armored car of some type.

386
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:48,590
It was meant to withstand bombs. I can't
just rip it apart with a crowbar.

387
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,252
Just junk it.

388
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:52,558
Maybe if you gave me
the proper tooIs, I couId--

389
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,996
Junk it!

390
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,796
You know what? I'm wiIIing to have
this discussion with you...

391
00:28:57,869 --> 00:29:00,394
but we shouId deaI with it
Iike two peopIe who respect--

392
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,898
I want it junked.

393
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:06,807
Okay.

394
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:11,440
Right now, I'm kind of Iike
a powder keg, and you're the match.

395
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:14,076
If you teII me to junk it
one more time--

396
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:15,585
Junk it, now!

397
00:29:16,954 --> 00:29:18,546
You got that?

398
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:36,305
That IittIe sucker
just saved your Iife.

399
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:40,840
Just junk it, you miserabIe cuss!

400
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:05,197
We interrupt this program
to bring you breaking news.

401
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:09,296
Champion City's best-known biIIionaire,
Lance Hunt, has disappeared.

402
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:11,308
PoIice hope to enIist the heIp
of Captain Amazing...

403
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:13,537
in the search for Hunt,
but have so far faiIed...

404
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:16,808
to contact the city's
beIoved superhero.

405
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:23,380
He makes a wonderfuI trophy,
don't you think?

406
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,985
Listen, we need
to taIk about your pIans here.

407
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:30,755
You know my pIans, Lancey.

408
00:30:30,828 --> 00:30:34,264
Tomorrow night,
I'm going to kiII you.

409
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:37,324
Right. That's the part
that reaIIy doesn't work for me.

410
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:40,064
When the cIock strikes 12:00--

411
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:41,833
cuckoo, cuckoo--

412
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:43,999
you wiII be dead...

413
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:47,602
und my city wiII be given
a new state of mind.

414
00:30:47,678 --> 00:30:50,306
CIearIy, you gotta go with
what you're comfortabIe with.

415
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:53,009
But I don't know.
I just keep coming back to this pIace.

416
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:57,487
I'm spitbaIIin' here,
but maybe we reIease the Captain...

417
00:30:57,555 --> 00:30:59,785
to the authorities.

418
00:30:59,857 --> 00:31:02,121
I say that you're
compIeteIy reformed-- wink, wink.

419
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:05,458
There's rejoicing in the streets.
Then, at that point...

420
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,761
you do the whoIe
''destruction of the city'' thing.

421
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:12,564
I mean, is it a perfect pIan? No.

422
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:15,470
And I think
that's what I Iike about it.

423
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,872
Jeez!

424
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:19,933
Okay, that's great.

425
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:23,447
Turn out the Iights now.
It was just an idea.

426
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:28,508
Okay, wait, I got a better one.
You Iet me Iive, I'm your sidekick.

427
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:32,898
I'm, Iike, Amazing Boy, or--
Casanova?

428
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:35,926
Are you sure Captain Amazing
is in there?

429
00:31:36,002 --> 00:31:38,766
Yeah, I'm sure. Let's go!

430
00:32:15,441 --> 00:32:19,377
Wait. Hear that?
We must have hit a trip wire.

431
00:32:19,445 --> 00:32:22,778
It couId be a photon-eviscerator
heating up.

432
00:32:22,848 --> 00:32:26,306
It couId be a cybernetic atom scrambIer.
They target moving objects.

433
00:32:26,385 --> 00:32:29,354
Sounds more Iike a heat-seeking
anthrax projection gun to me.

434
00:32:29,422 --> 00:32:31,583
- QuickIy, cover your mouths!
- Let's boIt!

435
00:32:31,657 --> 00:32:33,591
- Don't move!
- Don't breathe!

436
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,026
Don't move!

437
00:32:37,096 --> 00:32:39,189
Oh, it's the sprinkIer.

438
00:32:42,935 --> 00:32:47,065
Isn't that just fabu?
I'm positiveIy soaked.

439
00:32:51,711 --> 00:32:53,406
What do we got here?

440
00:32:53,479 --> 00:32:56,573
I think they're supposed to be
jive superheroes.

441
00:32:56,649 --> 00:32:59,880
WeII, they made a big mistake
coming to Casanova's pIace.

442
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:07,384
- What's so funny?
- That's it? That's your power?

443
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,859
You have guns?

444
00:33:08,928 --> 00:33:11,396
CouIdn't you be a IittIe more
creative than that?

445
00:33:11,464 --> 00:33:13,398
Do forgive
the impertinence, governor...

446
00:33:13,466 --> 00:33:15,900
but what the deviI does a pistoI
have to do with disco?

447
00:33:15,968 --> 00:33:18,528
- Weak.
- At best.

448
00:33:18,604 --> 00:33:22,131
Check out the guy with the pipe.
What are you, the Disco PIumber?

449
00:33:24,009 --> 00:33:25,977
There's no theme here.

450
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:29,446
If you're gonna carry a chain,
at Ieast make it a goId chain.

451
00:33:29,515 --> 00:33:31,449
See? That's just off
the top of my head.

452
00:33:31,517 --> 00:33:35,385
- Yo, what's up, Tiger LiIy?
- The top of your head, eh?

453
00:33:42,495 --> 00:33:45,589
We'II never get in there.
There's too many of those Disco Boys.

454
00:33:45,664 --> 00:33:48,690
I'm teIIing you, Amazing's in there.
I saw him go in.

455
00:33:48,768 --> 00:33:50,702
There's never any eviI trios,
are there?

456
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:55,207
No, they've aII got to traveI
in gangs, Iike IittIe babies.

457
00:33:55,274 --> 00:33:57,902
WeII, maybe it's time
to IeveI the pIaying fieId.

458
00:33:57,977 --> 00:33:59,911
How?

459
00:33:59,979 --> 00:34:01,913
I'm taIking about recruiting.

460
00:34:01,981 --> 00:34:05,212
There's pIenty of guys out there
who wouId kiII to get in on our action.

461
00:34:05,284 --> 00:34:08,344
- PIenty of poseurs, you mean.
- Yeah, maybe a few.

462
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,582
But there's gotta be
a coupIe of guys out there...

463
00:34:10,656 --> 00:34:13,420
Iike a Human Torch before he hit.

464
00:34:13,492 --> 00:34:17,519
Or Iike a guy who can shoot
stinging foam into your eyes.

465
00:34:17,596 --> 00:34:19,530
Or something Iike that.

466
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,133
- There's the Sphinx, of course.
- The what?

467
00:34:24,203 --> 00:34:26,535
- The Sphinx.
- I know this guy.

468
00:34:26,605 --> 00:34:30,097
Big crime fighter from down south.
Big-Ieague hitter down there.

469
00:34:30,176 --> 00:34:33,111
- What's his power?
- He's terribIy mysterious.

470
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:37,513
That's it? That's his power?
He's mysterious?

471
00:34:37,583 --> 00:34:39,210
WeII, terribIy mysterious.

472
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:43,813
PIus, he can, Iike,
cut guns in haIf with his mind.

473
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:47,188
ReaIIy? I hadn't heard that.

474
00:34:47,259 --> 00:34:49,193
We'II have to track
this Sphinx guy down.

475
00:34:49,261 --> 00:34:52,890
Meantime, I have an idea
where we can get another guy.

476
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:55,798
I'm free for Iunch tomorrow.
How about you?

477
00:34:56,735 --> 00:34:58,703
Nothing I couIdn't move around.

478
00:35:10,916 --> 00:35:15,410
Listen, why don't you guys go ahead.
I got to take care of something.

479
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,649
Oh, I see.

480
00:35:28,067 --> 00:35:30,439
Good cause there--
saving homeIess animaIs.

481
00:35:33,542 --> 00:35:35,476
Ooh, hog queen?

482
00:35:35,544 --> 00:35:38,911
- What?
- You're into motorcycIes.

483
00:35:38,981 --> 00:35:42,178
Oh. No, not reaIIy.

484
00:35:42,251 --> 00:35:44,549
Oh. 'Cause I got a motorcycIe.

485
00:35:45,755 --> 00:35:48,485
- What kind?
- It's a HarIey.

486
00:35:48,557 --> 00:35:50,525
A HarIey.

487
00:35:50,593 --> 00:35:55,189
It's a HarIey compatibIe.
BasicaIIy, the same engineering.

488
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:59,598
I hope we're cooI about Iast night.

489
00:36:01,003 --> 00:36:02,493
Last night?

490
00:36:02,571 --> 00:36:06,268
Like I said, I was kind of
in scary mode back there.

491
00:36:06,342 --> 00:36:10,278
Sometimes it comes off
a IittIe threatening or whatever.

492
00:36:10,346 --> 00:36:12,075
I don't find you threatening...

493
00:36:12,148 --> 00:36:15,584
WeII, you're very, uh--
you're very kind.

494
00:36:15,651 --> 00:36:17,380
at aII.

495
00:36:19,021 --> 00:36:21,455
Listen, I stiII feeI Iike
I shouId make it up to you somehow...

496
00:36:21,524 --> 00:36:24,049
in some way, you know?

497
00:36:24,126 --> 00:36:26,219
I feeI Iike I shouId
take you out to dinner...

498
00:36:26,295 --> 00:36:28,525
to make up for being
so scary or whatever.

499
00:36:28,597 --> 00:36:30,622
I'm reaIIy busy.

500
00:36:35,104 --> 00:36:36,196
Right.

501
00:36:37,306 --> 00:36:39,433
Our IittIe chess game continues.

502
00:36:43,045 --> 00:36:45,878
We're Iooking for the one
they caII the InvisibIe Boy.

503
00:36:45,948 --> 00:36:47,882
Oh, wow.

504
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:50,350
AII my Iife,
I've been ignored by peopIe.

505
00:36:50,419 --> 00:36:52,979
But finaIIy,
after years of being overIooked...

506
00:36:53,055 --> 00:36:56,422
I found I had
the power to disappear.

507
00:36:56,492 --> 00:36:59,825
- It's reaI ironic how it happened.
- Can we come in?

508
00:37:01,163 --> 00:37:03,597
- Yeah, sure. Come on.
- Thank you.

509
00:37:03,666 --> 00:37:06,260
Dad, I'm going to my room
with three strange men.

510
00:37:09,205 --> 00:37:13,141
- And that's pretty much it.
- So Iet me get this straight.

511
00:37:13,209 --> 00:37:17,407
You do have the abiIity
to become invisibIe?

512
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,414
But you can't give us a demonstration.

513
00:37:19,482 --> 00:37:23,680
No. I can onIy become invisibIe
when no one's watching.

514
00:37:24,687 --> 00:37:27,656
So, you're onIy invisibIe to yourseIf?

515
00:37:27,723 --> 00:37:31,819
No. If I Iook at myseIf,
I become visibIe again.

516
00:37:33,629 --> 00:37:38,430
So you can onIy become invisibIe
when absoIuteIy nobody's watching you?

517
00:37:42,004 --> 00:37:45,132
Do forgive our increduIity,
but I'm wondering...

518
00:37:45,207 --> 00:37:49,371
how you can be certain
you've achieved transparency at aII.

519
00:37:49,445 --> 00:37:51,470
WeII, when you go invisibIe...

520
00:37:53,215 --> 00:37:54,944
you can feeI it.

521
00:37:56,919 --> 00:37:59,353
- Okay, I'm Ieaving.
- It was nice to have met you.

522
00:37:59,422 --> 00:38:03,358
Whoa, whoa, wait. Don't go.
Where are you guys going? Can I come?

523
00:38:06,429 --> 00:38:08,795
No offense, kid,
but we're about to go up against...

524
00:38:08,864 --> 00:38:11,833
a reaIIy powerfuI superviIIain,
Casanova Frankenstein.

525
00:38:11,901 --> 00:38:15,564
That means we gotta find
a Iot of superheroes reaIIy quickIy.

526
00:38:15,638 --> 00:38:18,198
To teII you the truth,
we have no idea where to even start.

527
00:38:18,274 --> 00:38:19,969
I know tons of superheroes.

528
00:38:20,042 --> 00:38:22,909
- I'm sure you know a Iot--
- SeriousIy.

529
00:38:22,978 --> 00:38:26,379
I'm out there aII the time at the
costume shops, martiaI arts stores...

530
00:38:26,449 --> 00:38:28,383
taIking to guys, making connections.

531
00:38:28,451 --> 00:38:30,544
If you wanna break in,
you gotta network.

532
00:38:31,587 --> 00:38:34,181
And I know how to network.

533
00:38:34,256 --> 00:38:37,191
- Sorry, kid.
- Come on.

534
00:38:37,259 --> 00:38:39,489
Haven't you guys ever been a kid?

535
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:43,321
Haven't you guys ever had a dream?

536
00:38:52,274 --> 00:38:54,367
Let me see. Who eIse have I met?
There's the Pincher...

537
00:38:54,443 --> 00:38:58,209
the PickIer, Princess Headbutt...

538
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,612
White FIight and the BIack Menace--
they work together.

539
00:39:00,683 --> 00:39:02,173
SIow down, sIow down.

540
00:39:02,251 --> 00:39:04,947
Then there's, uh,
Professor Pink BeIIy...

541
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,954
and Lucky Pierre
and the French TickIer.

542
00:39:09,158 --> 00:39:13,026
- You've got their teIephone numbers?
- Most of them.

543
00:39:13,095 --> 00:39:16,189
We gotta figure out a way
to get them aII in one pIace.

544
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:20,193
- Some kind of a tryout.
- Yes, a tryout.

545
00:39:20,269 --> 00:39:23,670
Throw in a barbecue and a coupIe kegs,
they'II aII show up.

546
00:39:23,739 --> 00:39:26,037
The mooch factor
is pretty high with this crowd.

547
00:39:26,108 --> 00:39:28,599
A barbecue. That's a good idea.

548
00:39:28,677 --> 00:39:32,374
Oh, what? Oh, bugger aII.
It's the SpIeen. PIay dead.

549
00:39:32,448 --> 00:39:34,382
- Who's that?
- Don't turn your head or say anything.

550
00:39:49,765 --> 00:39:51,130
Hiya, feIIas.

551
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,361
Word on the street is
you're Iooking for superheroes.

552
00:39:53,435 --> 00:39:57,166
- Not reaIIy.
- ActuaIIy, we're just Ieaving.

553
00:39:57,239 --> 00:40:01,141
- Yes. Rotten Iuck.
- Oh. Here we go.

554
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:03,144
- Perfect timing.
- That's for you.

555
00:40:04,446 --> 00:40:07,006
- Hamburger, right?
- Yes, thank you.

556
00:40:07,082 --> 00:40:09,243
Enjoy.

557
00:40:09,318 --> 00:40:12,845
Why are you guys aIways dissing me?
It hurts my feeIings.

558
00:40:12,922 --> 00:40:15,186
I'm a superhero too.
I have powers.

559
00:40:15,257 --> 00:40:18,852
- ReaIIy? Like what?
- So gIad you asked.

560
00:40:18,928 --> 00:40:21,692
Excuse me. Excuse me.

561
00:40:24,233 --> 00:40:28,670
WeII, it aII started
when I was just 13 years of age.

562
00:40:28,737 --> 00:40:30,671
One day, whiIe waIking
with some friends...

563
00:40:30,739 --> 00:40:33,207
I accidentaIIy cut the cheese.

564
00:40:33,275 --> 00:40:35,743
WeII, in my adoIescent awkwardness...

565
00:40:35,811 --> 00:40:39,508
I bIamed it on an oId gypsy woman
who happened to be passing by.

566
00:40:39,582 --> 00:40:42,415
Big mistake!

567
00:40:42,484 --> 00:40:45,078
The gypsy woman
pIaced a curse upon my head.

568
00:40:45,154 --> 00:40:48,555
Because I'd smeIt it, she decreed...

569
00:40:48,624 --> 00:40:51,718
I wouId forevermore
be he who deaIt it!

570
00:40:52,628 --> 00:40:54,721
- Let me iIIustrate.
- You don't have to.

571
00:40:54,797 --> 00:40:56,731
It's not necessary, reaIIy.

572
00:40:58,834 --> 00:41:01,200
Let's see.

573
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:04,068
Distance: seven meters.

574
00:41:05,441 --> 00:41:07,909
Air speed normaI.

575
00:41:07,977 --> 00:41:10,468
Compensate for air conditioning.

576
00:41:11,981 --> 00:41:13,778
- PuII my fingers.
- Don't do it.

577
00:41:14,817 --> 00:41:16,546
Oh, dear God.

578
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:19,486
S-B-D!

579
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:30,255
SiIent, but deadIy.

580
00:41:30,332 --> 00:41:33,062
- That's good shooting.
- That was amazing!

581
00:41:33,135 --> 00:41:34,966
It's disgusting.
Don't encourage him.

582
00:41:37,006 --> 00:41:40,567
- You guys are recruiting superheroes.
- Fork it over.

583
00:41:40,643 --> 00:41:42,577
Where are you hoIding the tryouts?

584
00:41:42,645 --> 00:41:46,979
We don't know yet, but as soon as we
figure out, we'II get in touch with you.

585
00:41:47,049 --> 00:41:51,281
I bet we'd get a big turnout if we
did it somewhere with a swimming pooI.

586
00:41:52,421 --> 00:41:54,855
Oh, no!
No, no, no, no, no.

587
00:41:54,923 --> 00:41:57,585
AbsoIuteIy not. Nope.

588
00:42:04,833 --> 00:42:07,666
- I don't deserve this.
- I know.

589
00:42:09,304 --> 00:42:11,238
A Iot of men
I couId have married, Eddie.

590
00:42:11,306 --> 00:42:12,773
- StiII are.
- I understand.

591
00:42:12,841 --> 00:42:17,278
If one person vomits in my pooI,
I'm gonna divorce you.

592
00:42:17,346 --> 00:42:19,507
That's fair.

593
00:42:19,581 --> 00:42:21,549
Come on, kids!

594
00:42:27,456 --> 00:42:29,390
AII right, state your name and power.

595
00:42:29,458 --> 00:42:31,460
I am the WaffIer.
With my griddIe of justice...

596
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:32,927
I am the WaffIer.
With my griddIe of justice...

597
00:42:32,995 --> 00:42:37,625
I bash the enemy in the head,
or I burn them, Iike so.

598
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,691
Oh, don't do that.

599
00:42:39,768 --> 00:42:43,670
I aIso have my truth syrup,
which is Iow-fat.

600
00:42:43,739 --> 00:42:45,707
I've been working on a theme song.
Kind of a--

601
00:42:45,774 --> 00:42:49,005
WaffIe Man
I am the WaffIer

602
00:42:49,078 --> 00:42:52,138
GoId and crispy
Bad guys are history

603
00:42:53,716 --> 00:42:56,241
And I'm running, you know.
Just think about it.

604
00:42:56,318 --> 00:42:57,478
Do you have a heaIth pIan?
Maybe dentaI, eye.

605
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,434
Next.

606
00:43:00,102 --> 00:43:03,128
Hi. I am PenciIhead.

607
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:05,730
And I am Son of PenciIhead!

608
00:43:05,807 --> 00:43:09,573
- We erase crime.
- Two generations of-- Thank you.

609
00:43:09,645 --> 00:43:12,546
- Did I do aII right?
- Yeah, I think they Iiked us.

610
00:43:12,614 --> 00:43:15,048
I say.

611
00:43:15,117 --> 00:43:17,483
I'm BaIIerinaman!

612
00:43:18,453 --> 00:43:21,047
Oh! I don't need to see that.

613
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:32,556
Thanks.

614
00:43:32,634 --> 00:43:34,966
- I am--
- Hey!

615
00:43:35,037 --> 00:43:36,868
- You copied me!
- You copied me!

616
00:43:36,938 --> 00:43:38,496
- Did not!
- Liar!

617
00:43:38,573 --> 00:43:41,167
Ladies, Iet's pIay niceIy.

618
00:43:51,987 --> 00:43:54,478
I'd say there's potentiaI.

619
00:43:54,556 --> 00:43:59,357
I be the BuIIfighter.
I fight the buII!

620
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:02,022
Greetings, feIIow crime fighters.
I am Radio Man.

621
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:06,534
I am Squeegeeman.
Do you sense its power?

622
00:44:06,601 --> 00:44:10,970
PMS Avenger. I onIy work four days
a month. Is there a probIem with that?

623
00:44:13,308 --> 00:44:15,367
- Whatever you say.
- We'II get back to you.

624
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:17,207
Whatever!

625
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,871
Okay, that's it.

626
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:32,218
WeII, that was
a compIete waste of time.

627
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:34,228
Like so many things we do.

628
00:44:37,499 --> 00:44:40,332
Hi, you guys.
Am I too Iate to try out?

629
00:44:40,402 --> 00:44:42,461
- What time is it?
- I don't have a watch on.

630
00:44:42,537 --> 00:44:46,098
Yeah, sorry. You'II have to pretend
to be a superhero somewhere eIse.

631
00:44:46,174 --> 00:44:48,972
ReaIIy? I see.

632
00:44:49,044 --> 00:44:50,636
That's fine.

633
00:45:27,749 --> 00:45:30,217
I guess I'II just have
to take my baII and go home.

634
00:45:31,553 --> 00:45:34,852
- Wait a minute, miss!
- That was reaIIy cooI!

635
00:45:34,923 --> 00:45:36,948
- One second!
- Stop her!

636
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:39,619
- HoId on! Stop her!
- Can we speak?

637
00:45:39,694 --> 00:45:40,820
That was great.

638
00:45:40,896 --> 00:45:42,989
We might be abIe
to squeeze in one more interview.

639
00:45:43,064 --> 00:45:45,794
Seeing as how you
schIepped your baII aII this way.

640
00:45:45,867 --> 00:45:48,529
- Appreciate that, thanks.
- You're reaIIy good.

641
00:45:48,603 --> 00:45:50,571
What's up? I'm the SpIeen.

642
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:53,506
I'm the BowIer. How you doin'?

643
00:45:53,575 --> 00:45:55,338
You're very attractive.

644
00:45:58,447 --> 00:46:01,473
Why don't you
teII us a IittIe bit about yourseIf.

645
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:04,041
HeIp us understand
why we shouId choose you...

646
00:46:04,119 --> 00:46:06,087
over aII the other
quaIified appIicants.

647
00:46:06,154 --> 00:46:08,748
- What other quaIified appIicants?
- Eddie, pIease.

648
00:46:10,659 --> 00:46:12,718
Start at the top.
Where'd you get your powers?

649
00:46:12,794 --> 00:46:15,388
I got my powers from my father.

650
00:46:15,464 --> 00:46:17,591
Oh, okay. Who's he?

651
00:46:17,666 --> 00:46:21,227
- Ever heard of Carmine the BowIer?
- Have we ever heard--

652
00:46:21,303 --> 00:46:23,271
Cor bIimey, miss!

653
00:46:23,338 --> 00:46:25,602
Don't teII us
you're the BowIer's daughter.

654
00:46:25,674 --> 00:46:29,110
I seem to remember there being
a IittIe controversy around his death.

655
00:46:29,177 --> 00:46:31,702
The poIice said it was an accident.
He'd come home Iate one night...

656
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:35,580
and feII down an eIevator shaft
onto some buIIets.

657
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:38,517
I've aIways suspected
a bit of fouI pIay there.

658
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:40,214
As have I.

659
00:46:40,288 --> 00:46:43,621
So now Daddy's IittIe girI's aII
grown-up, Iookin' for a IittIe revenge?

660
00:46:43,692 --> 00:46:47,059
- Is that it?
- Yeah. Is there a probIem with that?

661
00:46:47,996 --> 00:46:49,964
- Why don't you teII me.
- I don't know. You teII me.

662
00:47:00,141 --> 00:47:02,132
AII right,
you've seen what I can do.

663
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:04,371
You either wanna use my taIents
or you don't.

664
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:07,108
If you don't, I seek another cabaI
and we do it that way.

665
00:47:07,182 --> 00:47:09,878
- We definiteIy need you.
- Indeed.

666
00:47:09,951 --> 00:47:12,920
- BowIer-- EveIyn--
- CaroI.

667
00:47:12,988 --> 00:47:17,391
CaroI, wiII you join
our IittIe ragtag trio?

668
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:19,051
You mean quartet, 'cause--

669
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:22,062
What are you taIking about?
There's five of us!

670
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:26,089
First of aII, nobody's green Iit any
new memberships yet, so just chiII out.

671
00:47:26,167 --> 00:47:27,657
AII right?

672
00:47:27,736 --> 00:47:30,899
Now, granted you got a good arm.
I'II give you that.

673
00:47:30,972 --> 00:47:32,997
- But we're an eIite cad-ray, cad--
- Cadre.

674
00:47:33,074 --> 00:47:35,269
- You're in.
- WeIcome aboard.

675
00:47:35,343 --> 00:47:37,641
Guys, wouId you--
What are you--

676
00:47:37,712 --> 00:47:40,112
- What's the probIem?
- WeIcome.

677
00:47:40,181 --> 00:47:42,081
- Eddie?
- What?

678
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:45,085
Nothing. No probIem.
Hey, weIcome aboard.

679
00:47:54,829 --> 00:47:57,764
- Are SpIeen and I on the team or not?
- Look, in my opinion...

680
00:47:57,832 --> 00:48:00,027
which used to matter around here,
we shouIdn't be fIinging membership...

681
00:48:00,101 --> 00:48:03,298
at every guy who puts together
a pair of matching gIoves and boots.

682
00:48:03,371 --> 00:48:06,033
You guys just be sure
to jump in when the action starts.

683
00:48:06,107 --> 00:48:09,543
- Do your share, we'II keep you around.
- Maybe.

684
00:48:09,611 --> 00:48:12,978
So you're a British man who converted
to IsIam, sort of Iike Cat Stevens?

685
00:48:13,048 --> 00:48:16,984
UntiI the earIy part of this century,
India was, in fact...

686
00:48:17,052 --> 00:48:19,612
part of the British empire,
whose government there...

687
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:23,556
was caIIed the British raj,
after the Hindi word for sovereignty.

688
00:48:23,625 --> 00:48:26,059
- Furthermore--
- Wait. What?

689
00:48:26,127 --> 00:48:28,322
Dad! Sit--

690
00:48:28,396 --> 00:48:30,387
No, he's not a commie nor a fruit.

691
00:48:31,399 --> 00:48:32,991
Sorry.

692
00:48:34,302 --> 00:48:37,203
- His ignorance embarrasses me.
- Sorry.

693
00:48:37,272 --> 00:48:40,332
Am I to understand you've inserted
your father's skuII...

694
00:48:40,408 --> 00:48:42,535
inside of that baII for bowIing?

695
00:48:42,611 --> 00:48:44,875
No. Guy at the pro shop did it.

696
00:48:48,283 --> 00:48:52,743
- That was Casanova's Iimo.
- You bet! Let's turn this around.

697
00:48:52,821 --> 00:48:54,880
He's probabIy got Amazing in there.

698
00:48:59,361 --> 00:49:00,521
Here we go.

699
00:49:00,595 --> 00:49:03,826
- I feeI carsick.
- Great.

700
00:49:05,467 --> 00:49:09,164
TeII me, Tony, who can we count
on seeing at my banquet tomorrow?

701
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:11,330
AII the top gangs are gonna be there.

702
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:13,499
They want to know
what you got up your sIeeve.

703
00:49:16,911 --> 00:49:20,870
Mr. Casanova,
I think we're being foIIowed.

704
00:49:37,532 --> 00:49:39,727
Let us say heIIo.

705
00:49:47,142 --> 00:49:50,771
- What's he doing?
- He's either very smart or very dumb.

706
00:50:07,083 --> 00:50:10,575
HeIIo. I wouId Iike a doubIe burger
with the Iarge fries.

707
00:50:11,721 --> 00:50:14,519
Do you boys want something to drink?

708
00:50:15,625 --> 00:50:18,526
We think you did something bad
to Captain Amazing.

709
00:50:18,594 --> 00:50:20,528
We wouId Iike you to teII us
where he is.

710
00:50:20,596 --> 00:50:24,054
Captain who? This name
does not ring any beIIs with me.

711
00:50:24,133 --> 00:50:26,431
I don't Iike your tone, Frankenpuss.

712
00:50:27,370 --> 00:50:29,304
Do yourseIf a favor
and don't punch my cIock...

713
00:50:29,372 --> 00:50:31,602
because I'm a ''Pantera's'' box
you do not want to open.

714
00:50:31,674 --> 00:50:34,973
It is Pandora.

715
00:50:35,044 --> 00:50:37,706
PIease don't correct me.
It sickens me.

716
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:39,873
You guys never Iearn, do you?

717
00:50:39,949 --> 00:50:42,918
ApparentIy we don't, ass.

718
00:50:42,985 --> 00:50:44,612
I know you.

719
00:50:44,687 --> 00:50:46,848
You don't know me.

720
00:50:46,923 --> 00:50:49,483
You knew my father, Carmine.

721
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:52,926
Carmine? The BowIer?

722
00:50:52,995 --> 00:50:55,429
- Yep.
- You're Baby BowIer.

723
00:50:55,498 --> 00:50:57,432
- Is that a probIem?
- HeIIo.

724
00:50:58,634 --> 00:51:01,262
I'm the guy
that gave your daddy the shaft.

725
00:51:02,505 --> 00:51:06,464
This is the Iast time I'm going
to ask you. Where is Captain Amazing?

726
00:51:06,542 --> 00:51:10,308
And a diet Pepsi
with a IittIe bit of ice.

727
00:51:23,893 --> 00:51:25,656
Okay, boys, Iet's go.

728
00:51:27,363 --> 00:51:28,591
Fork yourseIf!

729
00:51:34,904 --> 00:51:36,769
PuII!

730
00:51:54,524 --> 00:51:57,288
- Come on, Roy. Let's get out of here.
- Come on, Furious. Let's go!

731
00:51:58,928 --> 00:52:02,386
PeopIe who Iive in gIass houses
shouIdn't, because this is what happens!

732
00:52:05,067 --> 00:52:06,364
That's enough.

733
00:52:09,272 --> 00:52:11,638
The roof is on fire

734
00:52:11,707 --> 00:52:15,507
The roof, the roof
The roof is on fire

735
00:52:15,578 --> 00:52:18,911
We don't need no water
We don't need no water

736
00:52:20,583 --> 00:52:22,210
Here comes Daddy.

737
00:52:35,398 --> 00:52:36,422
Go!

738
00:52:56,586 --> 00:53:01,285
I wouId Iike to make a toast
to our first straight-out victory.

739
00:53:01,357 --> 00:53:03,552
The reIationship that you have
with your mother...

740
00:53:03,626 --> 00:53:05,560
affects every other dynamic
in your Iife.

741
00:53:05,628 --> 00:53:07,391
- True, quite true.
- What?

742
00:53:08,464 --> 00:53:11,956
Yes, a father's roIe is vitaI
in a chiId's Iife as weII.

743
00:53:12,034 --> 00:53:14,525
No, I'm not disrespecting you.

744
00:53:14,604 --> 00:53:16,595
You have to respect me too.
You have to aIIow me...

745
00:53:16,672 --> 00:53:19,072
to have conversations
in a bar-type situation...

746
00:53:19,141 --> 00:53:21,473
and taIk to my new friends,
and anyway...

747
00:53:21,544 --> 00:53:24,035
I'm an aduIt now.

748
00:53:24,113 --> 00:53:27,241
Do you wanna go back in the bag?
Is that how we're gonna do it now?

749
00:53:27,316 --> 00:53:29,307
You make the ruIes.

750
00:53:29,385 --> 00:53:31,319
If you don't zip it--

751
00:53:47,937 --> 00:53:50,462
There's not enough beer
in the worId, SpIeen. I'm sorry.

752
00:53:53,109 --> 00:53:55,441
Listen. You've got
to Iive in truth. Correct?

753
00:53:55,511 --> 00:53:59,003
The woman is a tiger.

754
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,483
Barkeep, another round...

755
00:54:06,555 --> 00:54:10,423
for my sweet team of superfriends.

756
00:54:10,493 --> 00:54:15,760
Barkeep, another round for
the super-- super-beIIies.

757
00:54:15,831 --> 00:54:17,924
Yes, to us. To aII of us.

758
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,127
See, that's what's so cooI
about this team.

759
00:54:20,202 --> 00:54:24,229
Everyone has their own powers
for aII these different situations.

760
00:54:24,307 --> 00:54:25,899
PuII my finger.

761
00:54:32,081 --> 00:54:35,539
- What?
- I was just thinking.

762
00:54:35,618 --> 00:54:39,884
I was just wondering
when we might see your superpower.

763
00:54:41,590 --> 00:54:44,286
It'II happen, kid. Don't worry.

764
00:54:46,762 --> 00:54:50,027
- I say ''sabo-taj.''
- ''Sabo-taj''?

765
00:54:50,099 --> 00:54:52,033
The ShoveIer is hammered!

766
00:55:03,045 --> 00:55:05,707
- So what's the name of this team?
- How about the Super Squad?

767
00:55:05,781 --> 00:55:09,581
How about the Six Dead Guys
In Their Stupid Costumes?

768
00:55:09,652 --> 00:55:12,621
No, no, no. The Magnificent Dead Guys.
How about that?

769
00:55:12,688 --> 00:55:14,815
What about the Legendary Super Freaks?

770
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:17,723
Way too positive.
They totaIed our car.

771
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:29,834
- Ready?
- Ready!

772
00:55:31,474 --> 00:55:32,736
- Aim.
- Aim!

773
00:55:34,844 --> 00:55:36,402
I Iove you!

774
00:55:36,479 --> 00:55:38,037
Fire!

775
00:55:45,788 --> 00:55:50,555
Okay, Six Very NearIy Dead Guys
Who Had A Temporary Reprieve.

776
00:55:50,626 --> 00:55:53,186
- That's your name.
- Six Jive Turkeys!

777
00:55:53,262 --> 00:55:56,060
- You dig, man?
- Yeah, I dig, man!

778
00:55:56,132 --> 00:55:59,863
That's your name!
KiII you Iater, superIosers!

779
00:56:05,441 --> 00:56:09,104
Crimony! You're the Sphinx!

780
00:56:09,178 --> 00:56:11,043
And you are fooIs.

781
00:56:11,113 --> 00:56:15,709
Tonight, you proved...

782
00:56:15,785 --> 00:56:18,049
your inexperience.

783
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:22,056
The wise man knows that
he is weakest...

784
00:56:22,124 --> 00:56:24,592
when he thinks himseIf strong.

785
00:56:26,462 --> 00:56:28,362
Mysterious.

786
00:56:28,431 --> 00:56:29,762
TerribIy mysterious.

787
00:56:29,832 --> 00:56:33,996
Casanova Frankenstein
is no ordinary viIIain.

788
00:56:34,070 --> 00:56:39,770
To fight him,
you must have extraordinary skiII.

789
00:56:39,842 --> 00:56:42,310
Thank you for that
IittIe piece of information...

790
00:56:42,378 --> 00:56:44,573
'cause I wouIdn't have thought
that we need extraordinary--

791
00:56:44,647 --> 00:56:46,740
Excuse me. Does anybody have
any manners?

792
00:56:46,816 --> 00:56:48,443
- Do you mind?
- Do I?

793
00:56:48,517 --> 00:56:49,484
- Do you?
- Do I?

794
00:56:49,552 --> 00:56:50,917
- You teII me.
- You teII me.

795
00:56:53,322 --> 00:56:55,347
- Do I mind what?
- SiIence!

796
00:56:55,424 --> 00:56:58,325
Hey, do we have to separate you two?

797
00:56:58,394 --> 00:57:01,124
Is that what you want?
You want to be separated?

798
00:57:01,197 --> 00:57:02,630
He started it.

799
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:08,637
You must be Iike the woIf pack...

800
00:57:08,704 --> 00:57:12,203
not Iike the six-pack.

801
00:57:12,337 --> 00:57:13,770
Teamwork. Yes!

802
00:57:13,838 --> 00:57:17,672
You were not ready
to face so great an enemy...

803
00:57:17,742 --> 00:57:22,441
not untiI you have vanquished
the enemy within yourseIves.

804
00:57:22,514 --> 00:57:25,483
- Yes!
- It's cooI, isn't it?

805
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:30,351
He goes right up to the point
of being, Iike, confusing.

806
00:57:30,422 --> 00:57:32,117
It's Ieadership.

807
00:57:33,224 --> 00:57:36,819
- It's what we've been missing.
- Yes, I quite agree.

808
00:57:36,895 --> 00:57:41,457
Sphinx, wiII you guide our
motIey IittIe gang of men-at-arms?

809
00:57:41,533 --> 00:57:44,525
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.
Are you serious?

810
00:57:44,602 --> 00:57:45,864
Come on.

811
00:57:51,309 --> 00:57:53,539
To Iearn my teachings...

812
00:57:53,611 --> 00:57:56,409
I must first teach you...

813
00:57:56,481 --> 00:57:58,312
how to Iearn.

814
00:58:09,894 --> 00:58:12,590
Learn to hide your strikes
from your opponent...

815
00:58:12,664 --> 00:58:15,360
and you'II more easiIy
strike his hide.

816
00:58:24,943 --> 00:58:28,276
- How many weapons do you wieId?
- Just one, Sphinx.

817
00:58:28,346 --> 00:58:31,873
No. The fist, the knee,
the eIbow, the head.

818
00:58:31,950 --> 00:58:35,408
You must Iash out with every Iimb,
Iike the octopus who pIays the drums.

819
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:43,160
Why am I doing this again?

820
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:45,389
When you can baIance
a tack hammer on your head...

821
00:58:45,463 --> 00:58:48,023
you wiII head off your foes
with a baIanced attack.

822
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:52,127
And why am I wearing
the watermeIon on my feet?

823
00:58:59,944 --> 00:59:02,344
I don't remember
teIIing you to do that.

824
00:59:04,782 --> 00:59:06,716
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

825
00:59:26,804 --> 00:59:28,897
I beIieve in my powers!

826
00:59:31,543 --> 00:59:35,070
I beIieve in the powers
of my teammates!

827
00:59:38,583 --> 00:59:40,847
I trust in my powers!

828
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:45,950
I trust in the powers
of my teammates!

829
00:59:51,529 --> 00:59:54,430
This team must Iearn
to work together...

830
00:59:54,499 --> 00:59:58,663
or mark my words,
it wiII be torn apart!

831
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:03,502
Now, gather around.

832
01:00:03,575 --> 01:00:06,942
Gather around.
Embrace one another.

833
01:00:07,745 --> 01:00:10,213
Embrace one another, quickIy.

834
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:16,983
Why do you stand aside
whiIe the others practice?

835
01:00:17,055 --> 01:00:19,046
Practice?

836
01:00:19,123 --> 01:00:21,318
That's not practicing.
That's group hugging.

837
01:00:21,392 --> 01:00:24,156
We shouId be busting in
on Casanova right now.

838
01:00:24,229 --> 01:00:28,689
He who questions training onIy
trains himseIf at asking questions.

839
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:32,928
What?

840
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:40,534
Who was Iooking
for the pinking shears?

841
01:00:40,612 --> 01:00:41,874
That was me.

842
01:00:41,946 --> 01:00:46,542
Ah, yes. Work weII on
your new costumes, my friends.

843
01:00:46,618 --> 01:00:50,452
For when you care
for what is outside...

844
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:53,786
what is inside cares for you.

845
01:00:53,858 --> 01:00:55,826
The cIock is ticking here.

846
01:00:55,893 --> 01:00:59,056
Are we gonna sew dresses aII day
or rescue Amazing?

847
01:00:59,130 --> 01:01:02,031
- I need a thimbIe. Anybody--
- Patience, my son.

848
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:04,330
To summon your power
for the confIict to come...

849
01:01:04,402 --> 01:01:07,667
you must first have power
over that which confIicts you.

850
01:01:07,739 --> 01:01:11,641
Okay, am I the onIy one who finds
these sayings a IittIe bit formuIaic?

851
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:13,904
''If you wanna push something down,
you have to puII it up.''

852
01:01:13,978 --> 01:01:15,912
''If you wanna go Ieft,
you have to right.''

853
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:18,505
Your temper is very quick,
my friend.

854
01:01:18,583 --> 01:01:21,074
But untiI you Iearn
to master your rage--

855
01:01:21,152 --> 01:01:23,643
Your rage wiII become your master?

856
01:01:24,856 --> 01:01:27,689
That's what you were
gonna say, right? Right?

857
01:01:27,759 --> 01:01:29,386
Not necessariIy.

858
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:32,088
You know what? That's it.
I'm out of here.

859
01:01:32,163 --> 01:01:36,031
Thanks for the advice, Mr. Mysterioso,
but it's time to get busy with it.

860
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:39,433
- Eddie, Iet's go.
- No, Roy. I think he's getting resuIts.

861
01:01:39,504 --> 01:01:41,438
Yeah, and the biggest one
is that we're aII outta here.

862
01:01:41,506 --> 01:01:43,804
Jeff, Iet's peeI some wheeIies.
Let's go.

863
01:01:45,576 --> 01:01:47,771
I don't want to Ieave the Sphinx.

864
01:01:47,845 --> 01:01:49,779
Okay, how about the rest of you?

865
01:01:49,847 --> 01:01:52,372
You wanna sit here and pIay
Suzy Homemaker with Captain Conundrum...

866
01:01:52,450 --> 01:01:54,714
or do you want to be superheroes?

867
01:02:02,994 --> 01:02:06,088
I don't need a compass to teII me
which way the wind shines.

868
01:02:07,699 --> 01:02:10,691
- Wait. Let's taIk about this.
- No, Iet's not taIk about it!

869
01:02:10,768 --> 01:02:13,532
You wanna sit here and make HaIIoween
outfits with LittIe Red Riding Hood...

870
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:15,765
or you wanna take care of business?

871
01:02:18,142 --> 01:02:21,942
WeII, I guess from now on
I ride in a woIf pack of one.

872
01:02:30,355 --> 01:02:32,118
We shouId go after him.

873
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:34,454
- He's okay.
- Let him go. He's a baby.

874
01:02:34,525 --> 01:02:36,459
We've never gone into battIe
without him.

875
01:02:36,527 --> 01:02:39,257
- If you Iove him so much, marry him.
- Why don't you marry him?

876
01:02:39,330 --> 01:02:41,321
- Why don't you?
- Why don't you?

877
01:02:41,399 --> 01:02:43,067
BowIer, ShoveIer, pIease.
Sphinx.

878
01:02:43,067 --> 01:02:44,227
BowIer, ShoveIer, pIease.
Sphinx.

879
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:48,432
What wisdom can you give us in this,
our most becIouded hour?

880
01:02:48,506 --> 01:02:50,497
Yeah, what do we do?

881
01:02:51,576 --> 01:02:54,306
The Ioss of manpower
can be repIaced...

882
01:02:54,379 --> 01:02:56,313
by the addition of firepower.

883
01:02:58,783 --> 01:03:00,717
WeII, I won't use guns.

884
01:03:00,785 --> 01:03:03,379
- I've been crystaI cIear about that.
- He won't even use a knife.

885
01:03:03,454 --> 01:03:05,922
You're not going to start with that
meshugas again, are you?

886
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:08,117
Casanova wiII have many weapons.

887
01:03:08,192 --> 01:03:12,959
To beat him, you wiII have to have
more than forks and fIatuIence.

888
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:19,094
HeIIer.

889
01:03:26,277 --> 01:03:30,179
''Dr. A. HeIIer. Weapons designer.

890
01:03:30,248 --> 01:03:33,012
Innovator. Inventor. WorId changer.''

891
01:03:54,505 --> 01:03:56,803
Why does he Iive
in a deserted amusement park?

892
01:03:56,874 --> 01:03:59,172
Because he's an eccentric genius,
that's why.

893
01:03:59,243 --> 01:04:02,371
I'II take point. You two, fIank.
Let's trianguIate.

894
01:04:02,447 --> 01:04:05,143
- EquiIateraI or isosceIes?
- Just go.

895
01:04:20,832 --> 01:04:23,733
Who wouId want to rent a chicken?

896
01:04:26,037 --> 01:04:28,972
It's weird in here.
It's scary and weird.

897
01:04:40,551 --> 01:04:42,109
There's another chicken.

898
01:04:42,186 --> 01:04:44,120
Crazy chicken worId.

899
01:04:55,186 --> 01:04:56,346
Dr. HeIIer?

900
01:04:58,556 --> 01:05:00,421
We come in peace.

901
01:05:01,793 --> 01:05:03,420
ShoveIhead?

902
01:05:03,495 --> 01:05:06,362
Uh, the ShoveIer. Yes, sir.
We met at the oId foIk's home.

903
01:05:06,431 --> 01:05:09,491
Of course. Forkman.

904
01:05:09,567 --> 01:05:13,025
No, I'm the SpIeen. If you wanna know
what my power is, puII my finger.

905
01:05:13,104 --> 01:05:15,834
- PIease, don't!
- No, sir, don't.

906
01:05:15,907 --> 01:05:19,240
Dr. HeIIer, we're on a mission.
We've come for weapons.

907
01:05:19,310 --> 01:05:22,939
ShouIdn't we see
a dipIoma or something first?

908
01:05:23,014 --> 01:05:26,745
You came to the right pIace, baby.
Step into my office.

909
01:05:30,488 --> 01:05:33,252
Where are your friends?

910
01:05:33,324 --> 01:05:35,224
What friends?

911
01:05:35,293 --> 01:05:40,287
Your friends. I thought you guys
were in a cIub or something.

912
01:05:40,365 --> 01:05:42,196
You mean a team? A superteam?

913
01:05:42,267 --> 01:05:44,565
Yeah.

914
01:05:44,636 --> 01:05:48,538
ApparentIy, it's now
the Super-Sphinx Team or something.

915
01:05:48,606 --> 01:05:52,372
- You had a faIIing out?
- Yeah, kind of.

916
01:05:54,813 --> 01:05:57,748
Is it okay if I just have the coffee?
I'm not very hungry.

917
01:05:57,816 --> 01:05:59,249
Sure.

918
01:06:05,323 --> 01:06:07,791
What time do you get off work?

919
01:06:07,859 --> 01:06:11,056
HaIf hour. Why?

920
01:06:11,129 --> 01:06:15,031
No reason.
I was just thinking maybe I couId--

921
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:17,068
It might be a good idea
if I waIked you home...

922
01:06:17,135 --> 01:06:22,471
'cause the city's been reaI dangerous
since Amazing went MIA.

923
01:06:25,910 --> 01:06:30,404
I've been working on some
jujitsu moves that, you know, just--

924
01:06:30,482 --> 01:06:33,349
ProbabIy be safer on everybody's
part if-- AIso, it'd be great...

925
01:06:33,418 --> 01:06:37,411
to just waIk you home.

926
01:06:39,524 --> 01:06:41,151
Sure.

927
01:06:45,930 --> 01:06:49,627
This wiII even things up a IittIe bit.
What is it?

928
01:06:49,701 --> 01:06:53,467
- Look at this! Pow! Pow! Pow!
- Don't point it at me.

929
01:06:53,538 --> 01:06:56,439
- You're gonna kiII somebody.
- Oh, no, no, no.

930
01:06:56,508 --> 01:06:59,068
Listen, everything here is nonIethaI.

931
01:07:00,845 --> 01:07:02,938
NonIethaI? What?

932
01:07:03,014 --> 01:07:04,948
I don't make anything that deadIy.

933
01:07:05,016 --> 01:07:08,975
Oh, I see.
How deIightfuIIy eccentric...

934
01:07:09,053 --> 01:07:11,544
whiIe simuItaneousIy being
a compIete waste of our time.

935
01:07:11,623 --> 01:07:13,557
- No offense. ShaII we?
- Thank you, Doctor.

936
01:07:13,625 --> 01:07:16,492
- I said, good day.
- See ya, Doc.

937
01:07:16,561 --> 01:07:18,552
That is why, in generaI,
a mad scientist...

938
01:07:18,630 --> 01:07:22,225
is Iess desirabIe
than a garden-variety scientist.

939
01:07:24,969 --> 01:07:27,164
Incoming!

940
01:07:31,309 --> 01:07:33,470
- Look out!
- Watch out!

941
01:07:56,301 --> 01:07:58,326
Doc, you're a genius!

942
01:07:58,403 --> 01:08:00,803
A canned tornado, huh?

943
01:08:00,872 --> 01:08:03,932
TotaIIy nonIethaI,
but totaIIy effective.

944
01:08:04,008 --> 01:08:06,203
What is this thing
you were handIing before?

945
01:08:06,277 --> 01:08:08,802
- That's a shrinker.
- How do you know?

946
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,438
A manuaI. CooI.

947
01:08:10,515 --> 01:08:14,508
That's a high-temperature,
fabric-adhesive Iiquid projector...

948
01:08:14,586 --> 01:08:18,420
based on simpIe
dry-cIeaning technoIogy.

949
01:08:18,489 --> 01:08:22,050
You aim that at a guy, and--
I'II teII you something.

950
01:08:22,126 --> 01:08:25,459
His cIothes get so tight,
he can't even breathe.

951
01:08:25,530 --> 01:08:27,555
I can trick that out
with a cIamsheII hoIster.

952
01:08:27,632 --> 01:08:31,466
Comes with a Ieather carrying case.
It's got a wad cutter and fuII warranty.

953
01:08:31,536 --> 01:08:34,130
- NiceIy done.
- And what do you caII this?

954
01:08:34,205 --> 01:08:36,196
CarefuI, that's a bIame-thrower.

955
01:08:36,274 --> 01:08:38,868
A bIame-thrower?
Oh, I'm sorry.

956
01:08:38,943 --> 01:08:41,207
Your bad attitude
is hurting this team!

957
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:45,477
- Stop spitting! I took a shower!
- You need another. You stink!

958
01:08:45,550 --> 01:08:48,451
- Want me to get that zit?
- That stung!

959
01:08:54,259 --> 01:08:56,921
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

960
01:09:00,632 --> 01:09:05,069
- Doctor, you are a genius.
- That's what the card says.

961
01:09:06,604 --> 01:09:09,664
I stiII want to be with them
when they go rescue Amazing.

962
01:09:09,741 --> 01:09:11,675
So why don't you just go back?

963
01:09:11,743 --> 01:09:14,041
I couIdn't go back.
I Ieft this morning. That wouId be--

964
01:09:14,112 --> 01:09:16,876
- This is my pIace.
- That wouId be ridicuIous.

965
01:09:16,948 --> 01:09:18,882
They're your friends.
They'II understand.

966
01:09:18,950 --> 01:09:22,408
It's cIearIy what
you want to do, you know?

967
01:09:22,487 --> 01:09:26,014
That actuaIIy couId work.
I'm Mr. Furious, right?

968
01:09:26,090 --> 01:09:28,024
I'm unpredictabIe.
I'm a Ioose cannon.

969
01:09:28,092 --> 01:09:30,026
I go storming off.
Why can't I come storming back?

970
01:09:30,094 --> 01:09:32,528
Huh? I mean, it's aII in how
you pIay it, right?

971
01:09:32,597 --> 01:09:34,531
Or don't pIay it.

972
01:09:34,599 --> 01:09:39,161
Just go back, say you're sorry
and heIp them save Captain Amazing.

973
01:09:39,237 --> 01:09:41,797
You think there's a reaIIy angry way
I couId say I'm sorry?

974
01:09:42,941 --> 01:09:44,499
Just 'cause that's kind of my--

975
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:47,442
I gotta stick with the anger thing,
'cause peopIe Iike that.

976
01:09:52,150 --> 01:09:56,143
Maybe peopIe Iike you for who
you reaIIy are. You know?

977
01:09:58,690 --> 01:10:01,158
I'm gonna go.

978
01:10:06,431 --> 01:10:08,592
You shouId go find your friends.

979
01:10:20,578 --> 01:10:22,273
Good.

980
01:10:22,347 --> 01:10:26,283
Now, the three of you
wiII be Iike the eagIe's cIaw.

981
01:10:26,351 --> 01:10:29,218
You wiII snatch up the hostage
and carry him to safety.

982
01:10:29,287 --> 01:10:34,247
We three scouts wiII be Iike the
eagIe's eye, ever watchfuI for danger.

983
01:10:35,927 --> 01:10:38,054
- Are you ready?
- Ready.

984
01:10:38,129 --> 01:10:42,566
Then Iet operation Three-Eyed,
Three-Legged EagIe begin.

985
01:10:47,705 --> 01:10:50,299
- Shotgun!
- I think not, my friend.

986
01:10:59,584 --> 01:11:01,848
SiIIy twit.

987
01:11:01,919 --> 01:11:03,784
Give me a second.

988
01:11:08,126 --> 01:11:10,185
- Hey.
- Hey. What's up?

989
01:11:10,261 --> 01:11:12,991
Not a Iot.
What's up with you?

990
01:11:13,064 --> 01:11:14,656
Nothing much.

991
01:11:16,868 --> 01:11:20,360
- Hey, have you seen my address book?
- No, what did it Iook Iike?

992
01:11:21,873 --> 01:11:26,310
Uh, it's denim. It says ''Hang Ioose''
on it with a picture of a kitten.

993
01:11:31,049 --> 01:11:33,745
You shouId probabIy think about
where you saw it Iast.

994
01:11:33,818 --> 01:11:35,649
Right.

995
01:11:40,591 --> 01:11:44,186
WeII, I shouId probabIy, um--

996
01:11:47,465 --> 01:11:51,697
Look, Eddie, there's something
I want to say, okay?

997
01:11:51,769 --> 01:11:55,330
I'm angry. I'm angry about
being Ieft out of this mission...

998
01:11:55,406 --> 01:11:57,533
and about what's happening
with this team...

999
01:11:57,608 --> 01:12:01,339
but I'm-- I'm--

1000
01:12:03,247 --> 01:12:04,839
Oh, boy.

1001
01:12:07,685 --> 01:12:09,277
Temperature rising.

1002
01:12:10,755 --> 01:12:13,280
Vision bIurring.

1003
01:12:13,357 --> 01:12:17,191
- Rage taking over.
- Roy, I got an idea.

1004
01:12:17,261 --> 01:12:19,957
- Why don't you come with us?
- Okay.

1005
01:12:20,031 --> 01:12:21,999
Rage subsiding.

1006
01:12:23,668 --> 01:12:25,260
PuIse sIowing.

1007
01:12:26,437 --> 01:12:29,167
Anger fading.

1008
01:12:31,876 --> 01:12:34,037
That was quick thinking, Eddie.

1009
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:39,415
WeII, I wouIdn't want anyone
to get hurt.

1010
01:13:08,278 --> 01:13:10,610
- Drink, drink, drink!
- MazeI tov!

1011
01:13:16,619 --> 01:13:18,883
Right then.
I'II scout out a way in.

1012
01:13:18,955 --> 01:13:22,049
- What shouId the signaI be?
- ''Ca-ree.'' ''Ca-ree, ca-roo.''

1013
01:13:22,125 --> 01:13:24,059
No, no, what about,
''WhippoorwiII, whippoorwiII''?

1014
01:13:24,127 --> 01:13:26,721
- No, ''Ca-ree, ca-roo.''
- Yes, but isn't that better?

1015
01:13:26,796 --> 01:13:30,732
- Not interested.
- Enough with the cuckoo!

1016
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,893
- We have to find an open window.
- That's what I just said.

1017
01:13:32,969 --> 01:13:34,561
Go, go!

1018
01:13:40,710 --> 01:13:42,644
Does everyone have a drink?

1019
01:13:42,712 --> 01:13:47,172
- Yes, we aII do!
- You're aII good? Good.

1020
01:13:47,250 --> 01:13:50,276
WeII, it is wonderfuI in my heart...

1021
01:13:50,353 --> 01:13:54,016
to see so many famiIiar faces
once again.

1022
01:13:54,090 --> 01:13:57,856
The Susies--
assassins from the East.

1023
01:13:59,262 --> 01:14:03,665
The Suits-- downsizing
aII those who dare oppose them.

1024
01:14:03,733 --> 01:14:07,066
And the Furriers--
aIways dressed to kiII.

1025
01:14:11,841 --> 01:14:17,006
And the Frat Boys--
stiII on probation for IethaI hazing.

1026
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:18,069
Phi Zeta!

1027
01:14:18,147 --> 01:14:22,481
And, of course,
the Not So Goody Mob--

1028
01:14:22,552 --> 01:14:25,214
putting the rhyme into crime!

1029
01:14:25,288 --> 01:14:27,552
The pIeasure's aII mine,
Frankenstein.

1030
01:14:27,623 --> 01:14:29,955
We're about to perpetrate some eviI
on these Champion City peopIe.

1031
01:14:30,026 --> 01:14:33,052
- Rappin', snappin', cappin'.
- Yeah.

1032
01:14:33,129 --> 01:14:37,862
Tonight, we are having
quite a party, a surprise party.

1033
01:14:37,934 --> 01:14:40,994
I have a IittIe something
up my sIeeve...

1034
01:14:41,070 --> 01:14:44,597
and I'm not just taIking
about the wart on my eIbow.

1035
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:54,009
I have created
a beautifuI machine...

1036
01:14:54,083 --> 01:14:57,519
that is going to encourage
our feIIow citizens...

1037
01:14:57,587 --> 01:15:00,920
to share my vision...

1038
01:15:00,990 --> 01:15:02,582
of the worId!

1039
01:15:03,793 --> 01:15:06,489
Can you dig it?

1040
01:15:07,830 --> 01:15:10,594
What about Captain Amazing?

1041
01:15:10,666 --> 01:15:14,500
That is an exceIIent question,
Big Tobacco.

1042
01:15:14,570 --> 01:15:17,437
What are we going to do
about the greatest superhero...

1043
01:15:17,507 --> 01:15:19,441
that Champion City has ever known?

1044
01:15:19,509 --> 01:15:24,640
For the answer,
I want you aII to waIk this way.

1045
01:15:24,714 --> 01:15:27,512
Dude, can we bring the brewskis?

1046
01:15:28,317 --> 01:15:31,252
Yes, of course.
You may absoIuteIy bring the brewskis.

1047
01:15:39,996 --> 01:15:43,090
Things Iook pretty quiet to me.

1048
01:15:47,170 --> 01:15:49,104
Hey, InvisibIe Boy,
did you just Iet one go?

1049
01:15:49,172 --> 01:15:51,834
- No, that wasn't me.
- WeII, it wasn't me.

1050
01:15:58,181 --> 01:16:00,172
Don't run! He'II shoot!

1051
01:16:09,892 --> 01:16:11,951
Is he doing what I think he's doing?

1052
01:16:17,033 --> 01:16:18,967
Just go with it.

1053
01:16:29,612 --> 01:16:31,705
- Can anybody see anything?
- Hey!

1054
01:16:31,781 --> 01:16:33,715
- Who said, ''Hey''?
- Not me.

1055
01:16:33,783 --> 01:16:36,650
Eddie, you don't have to say,
''Not me,'' okay?

1056
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:40,314
- If someone says, ''Who?'' and you say--
- Hey, morons, over here.

1057
01:16:40,389 --> 01:16:43,051
It's Captain Amazing!

1058
01:16:43,125 --> 01:16:47,152
- We've been Iooking for you.
- There's a Iight switch behind you.

1059
01:16:49,398 --> 01:16:55,030
My, my, my. WeII, weII.
We meet again, eh, Captain?

1060
01:16:55,104 --> 01:16:58,198
- We're here to rescue you.
- Yeah.

1061
01:16:58,274 --> 01:17:01,437
I'm BIue Raja. Do you recaII me?
Master of SiIverware.

1062
01:17:01,511 --> 01:17:04,810
You toId me to keep up the good work
after the Red Eye skirmish.

1063
01:17:04,881 --> 01:17:07,907
I meet so many peopIe
in this business, but I think so.

1064
01:17:07,984 --> 01:17:11,545
CouId you two Iocate the master
ignition switch on the main consoIe?

1065
01:17:11,621 --> 01:17:13,111
Maybe you couId open that up?

1066
01:17:13,189 --> 01:17:15,384
Have you out in two shakes
of a Iamb's taiI.

1067
01:17:15,458 --> 01:17:17,392
- FrightfuIIy uncomfortabIe.
- Great.

1068
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:20,020
- How does this work?
- Oh, I've seen one of these things.

1069
01:17:20,096 --> 01:17:23,122
You've got to push
this thing in and twist it.

1070
01:17:23,199 --> 01:17:25,064
- Don't force it!
- She's right.

1071
01:17:25,134 --> 01:17:28,501
This contraption is, in fact,
a weapon of mass destruction.

1072
01:17:28,571 --> 01:17:31,563
Casanova pIans to turn it
against the city at midnight.

1073
01:17:31,641 --> 01:17:33,302
Something's happening.

1074
01:17:33,376 --> 01:17:38,075
Good. Now, on the waII to your Ieft
you shouId see two toggIes side-by-side.

1075
01:17:38,147 --> 01:17:40,945
''ToggIes''? What do you mean?
You taIking about switches?

1076
01:17:41,817 --> 01:17:44,149
- I see them, Captain.
- Thank you.

1077
01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:46,814
- FIip the first toggIe.
- FIipping.

1078
01:17:48,724 --> 01:17:49,952
ExceIIent work.

1079
01:17:50,026 --> 01:17:52,290
- Now, fIip the--
- JoIIy good work, team!

1080
01:17:52,361 --> 01:17:55,421
- JoIIy good!
- CouId you stay over there, pIease?

1081
01:17:55,498 --> 01:17:56,760
Of course.

1082
01:17:59,902 --> 01:18:01,836
Sorry.

1083
01:18:01,904 --> 01:18:04,805
- Now fIip the second toggIe.
- Do as he says.

1084
01:18:04,874 --> 01:18:07,240
The man knows what of he speaks.

1085
01:18:07,310 --> 01:18:12,111
Captain, I'm gonna ask you directIy.
Do you know biIIionaire Lance Hunt?

1086
01:18:12,181 --> 01:18:14,945
It's me.

1087
01:18:15,017 --> 01:18:16,951
No, I'm kidding with you.
I've aIways wanted to do that.

1088
01:18:17,019 --> 01:18:20,420
- What's next?
- I toId you, fIip the second toggIe.

1089
01:18:20,489 --> 01:18:23,253
- Again?
- What do you mean?

1090
01:18:23,326 --> 01:18:26,454
- FIip the toggIe twice?
- No, no, no.

1091
01:18:26,529 --> 01:18:28,827
Don't do that.
Just fIip it again now, one time.

1092
01:18:28,898 --> 01:18:31,765
- FIip it.
- Does he understand what I'm asking?

1093
01:18:31,834 --> 01:18:36,430
HoId on a second. Captain, exactIy
how many toggIe fIips in toto...

1094
01:18:36,505 --> 01:18:38,439
are invoIved in this procedure?

1095
01:18:38,507 --> 01:18:42,136
I just-- It's-- Seven!

1096
01:18:42,211 --> 01:18:44,179
- Seven?
- FIip it!

1097
01:18:44,246 --> 01:18:47,113
- Seven?
- Everybody, hoId the phone.

1098
01:18:47,183 --> 01:18:50,778
You phrased that incorrectIy. We need to
know how many toggIe fIips are needed...

1099
01:18:50,853 --> 01:18:54,721
not counting the gratuitous toggIe fIip
you may have asked for...

1100
01:18:54,790 --> 01:18:56,280
in a moment of panic.

1101
01:18:56,359 --> 01:18:58,987
Okay, you know what?
CouId we just start again?

1102
01:18:59,061 --> 01:19:00,995
Is there some sort
of reset button on this thing?

1103
01:19:01,063 --> 01:19:04,328
No, you IittIe freak, there's no button
for resetting. FIip the switch, Iady.

1104
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:06,994
Don't stare at me.
Lift your Ieft arm. FIip it, you moron!

1105
01:19:07,069 --> 01:19:09,503
- Whoa. I am not a moron.
- You're a moron!

1106
01:19:09,572 --> 01:19:11,699
Do not caII her a moron.
That's not cooI.

1107
01:19:11,774 --> 01:19:15,073
- I wiII do it! I'II do it!
- FIip the switch, Iady!

1108
01:19:15,144 --> 01:19:17,510
It's this one, yes?

1109
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:21,038
Uh-oh! Wrong switch.

1110
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:40,801
Everybody heard me say
''reset button,'' right?

1111
01:19:40,870 --> 01:19:43,896
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, we kiIIed him.

1112
01:19:43,973 --> 01:19:45,998
What do you mean ''we''?
I was right here.

1113
01:20:01,152 --> 01:20:03,985
I'm gonna check his puIse.

1114
01:20:09,293 --> 01:20:11,261
I don't think he's gonna puII through.

1115
01:20:11,328 --> 01:20:13,262
Somebody's coming.
We gotta get outta here.

1116
01:20:13,330 --> 01:20:14,695
Let's get out of here!

1117
01:20:14,765 --> 01:20:17,700
Everybody shouId just keep
hoIding their horses.

1118
01:20:17,768 --> 01:20:19,929
Go, go, go!

1119
01:20:35,286 --> 01:20:38,221
- This sucker's dead.
- What happened to him?

1120
01:20:39,657 --> 01:20:45,027
As you can see,
I have taken Captain Amazing...

1121
01:20:45,095 --> 01:20:47,529
out of the picture.

1122
01:20:47,598 --> 01:20:49,566
It's time for us to ruIe!

1123
01:20:52,603 --> 01:20:56,198
Tonight at midnight,
I'm going to do to Champion City...

1124
01:20:56,273 --> 01:20:59,572
what I have done
to its greatest superhero.

1125
01:20:59,643 --> 01:21:03,841
Und there'II stiII be time
to go up, get down und boogie.

1126
01:21:05,549 --> 01:21:08,814
- Come on! Let's get outta here!
- Where's Captain Amazing?

1127
01:21:08,886 --> 01:21:11,514
There's been a bit of a cock-up.

1128
01:21:11,589 --> 01:21:14,649
Guys, we got a IittIe bigger fish
to fry right now.

1129
01:21:14,725 --> 01:21:16,659
What was that machine?

1130
01:21:16,727 --> 01:21:19,161
I don't know.
But I know where we can find out.

1131
01:21:25,970 --> 01:21:28,803
The vermin are back.

1132
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:34,443
Vermin shouId be exterminated,
Casanova.

1133
01:21:34,511 --> 01:21:38,072
A fish fork is no match
for my machine!

1134
01:21:39,416 --> 01:21:43,409
But I think we shouId take out
some insurance.

1135
01:21:43,487 --> 01:21:45,011
Don't you think?

1136
01:21:45,155 --> 01:21:47,248
It's a psychofrakuIator.

1137
01:21:47,324 --> 01:21:50,384
It creates a cIoud
of radicaIIy fIuctuating...

1138
01:21:50,461 --> 01:21:53,191
free-deviant chaotrons
which penetrate the synaptic reIays.

1139
01:21:53,264 --> 01:21:58,031
It's concatenated with
a synchronous transport switch...

1140
01:21:58,102 --> 01:22:00,332
that creates a virtuaI tributary.

1141
01:22:01,438 --> 01:22:04,407
It's focused
onto a bioboIic refIector.

1142
01:22:04,475 --> 01:22:08,275
What happens is that haIIucinations
become reaIity...

1143
01:22:09,346 --> 01:22:11,405
and the brain is IiteraIIy
fried from within.

1144
01:22:11,482 --> 01:22:15,077
- Where wouId you get that?
- They said it couIdn't be buiIt.

1145
01:22:15,152 --> 01:22:17,586
The equations were so compIex...

1146
01:22:17,655 --> 01:22:20,818
that most of the scientists who worked
on it wound up in the insane asyIum.

1147
01:22:20,891 --> 01:22:24,622
Which is where Casanova's been hanging
for the Iast 20 years.

1148
01:22:24,695 --> 01:22:27,323
If he turned that thing on the city,
it'II waste everything in sight.

1149
01:22:27,398 --> 01:22:29,389
- Not if-- when.
- We need Captain Amazing.

1150
01:22:29,466 --> 01:22:32,333
UnfortunateIy we just kiIIed him.

1151
01:22:32,403 --> 01:22:35,304
UnfortunateIy, you kiIIed him.
Remember?

1152
01:22:35,372 --> 01:22:37,704
Your probIems at home don't mean
you can go around kiIIing peopIe.

1153
01:22:37,775 --> 01:22:42,303
Sorry, Mummy, sorry.
I'm EngIish. I didn't mean it.

1154
01:22:42,379 --> 01:22:45,075
K-I-L-L-E-D. You kiIIed him.

1155
01:22:45,149 --> 01:22:48,277
You kiIIed him.
You were the one who fIicked the switch.

1156
01:22:48,352 --> 01:22:50,445
It's the same difference.
He's stiII dead.

1157
01:22:50,521 --> 01:22:52,716
Nobody-- You did, kinda.

1158
01:22:52,790 --> 01:22:57,750
Sphinx! Sphinx, what
in heaven's name do we do?

1159
01:22:58,829 --> 01:23:02,196
Sometimes the true hero...

1160
01:23:02,266 --> 01:23:05,030
is the one with the courage
to run away.

1161
01:23:05,102 --> 01:23:08,265
- I Iike the way this man thinks.
- Let's run.

1162
01:23:09,673 --> 01:23:13,370
- We can't run.
- Yes. It's been estabIished we can run.

1163
01:23:15,279 --> 01:23:19,773
Egg saIad is Ioaded with choIesteroI.
The wife won't Iet me touch it.

1164
01:23:19,850 --> 01:23:25,117
HardIy seems to matter now,
'cause chances are, we're aIready dead.

1165
01:23:25,189 --> 01:23:27,589
Amazing is gone.

1166
01:23:27,658 --> 01:23:30,388
There's no use waiting for the cavaIry,
because as of this moment...

1167
01:23:30,461 --> 01:23:32,691
the cavaIry is us.

1168
01:23:32,763 --> 01:23:36,164
- I don't wanna get frakuIated.
- PsychofrakuIated.

1169
01:23:36,233 --> 01:23:39,999
- We stiII get frakuIated.
- This is our fight. Just we few.

1170
01:23:40,070 --> 01:23:43,403
We're not your cIassic superheroes.

1171
01:23:43,474 --> 01:23:46,307
We're not the favorites.
We're the other guys.

1172
01:23:46,377 --> 01:23:48,402
We're the guys nobody bets on.

1173
01:23:50,848 --> 01:23:53,510
But I think you
and that baII of yours...

1174
01:23:53,584 --> 01:23:55,745
have an appointment
that you've gotta keep.

1175
01:23:57,054 --> 01:24:00,023
InvisibIe Boy,
it's time you were seen.

1176
01:24:00,090 --> 01:24:02,684
Sphinx, you have trained us weII.

1177
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:06,218
Dr. HeIIer, you might
just have given us the edge we need.

1178
01:24:07,564 --> 01:24:10,863
SpIeen, I don't wanna
stand behind you...

1179
01:24:10,934 --> 01:24:13,232
but I'II fight beside you with pride.

1180
01:24:13,303 --> 01:24:16,238
Jeff, you've got a rare
and beautifuI gift.

1181
01:24:16,306 --> 01:24:19,742
The city needs you tonight.
And Roy?

1182
01:24:19,810 --> 01:24:23,541
In aII the years I've known you, I've
never seen you waIk away from a fight.

1183
01:24:23,614 --> 01:24:26,515
You Iifted a city bus once.

1184
01:24:26,583 --> 01:24:29,051
You've got what it takes
to handIe Casanova.

1185
01:24:30,854 --> 01:24:33,550
We're aII in over our heads,
and we know it.

1186
01:24:33,624 --> 01:24:36,422
But if we take on this fight,
those of us who survive it...

1187
01:24:36,493 --> 01:24:40,088
wiII forever after show our scars
with pride...

1188
01:24:40,164 --> 01:24:44,692
and say, ''That's right. I was there.
I fought the good fight.''

1189
01:24:44,768 --> 01:24:48,568
What do you say?
Do we aII gather together...

1190
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:52,769
and go kick some Casanova butt...

1191
01:24:52,843 --> 01:24:55,778
or do I eat this sandwich?

1192
01:24:55,846 --> 01:24:58,781
I say, what the ''fork''!
Let's do it.

1193
01:25:01,218 --> 01:25:04,312
If we're gonna bust into that mansion,
you'II need more than a station wagon.

1194
01:25:04,388 --> 01:25:07,380
At the auto yard, there's
this oId Herkimer BattIe Jitney.

1195
01:25:07,458 --> 01:25:10,120
Wait! You have
a Herkimer BattIe Jitney?

1196
01:25:10,194 --> 01:25:12,958
That's the finest nonIethaI
miIitary vehicIe ever made.

1197
01:25:13,030 --> 01:25:16,090
AII right, we'II meet at the junkyard.
We'II go from there.

1198
01:25:16,166 --> 01:25:18,862
I shaII need more forks,
I'm afraid.

1199
01:25:18,936 --> 01:25:22,804
Say good-bye to your Ioved ones.
You may not get another chance.

1200
01:25:43,494 --> 01:25:45,587
Jeffrey, what are you doing?

1201
01:25:45,662 --> 01:25:48,290
I was just--

1202
01:25:55,506 --> 01:25:57,440
I'm a superhero, Mother.

1203
01:25:57,508 --> 01:26:00,170
A superhero?

1204
01:26:00,244 --> 01:26:02,235
An effete British superhero,
to be precise.

1205
01:26:02,312 --> 01:26:05,372
I am piIfering your tabIeware
because I hurI it.

1206
01:26:05,449 --> 01:26:09,146
I hurI it with a deadIy accuracy.
The BIue Raja is my name.

1207
01:26:09,219 --> 01:26:12,313
Yes, I don't wear much bIue,
and I speak in a British accent.

1208
01:26:12,389 --> 01:26:14,619
But if you know your history,
it does make sense.

1209
01:26:14,691 --> 01:26:17,660
The point is,
your boy's a Iimey fork-fIinger.

1210
01:26:17,728 --> 01:26:21,323
Hard cheese to swaIIow,
but there it is.

1211
01:26:21,398 --> 01:26:23,559
What wiII the bridge cIub think?

1212
01:26:27,137 --> 01:26:29,071
You need more forks?

1213
01:26:33,110 --> 01:26:36,671
These beIonged to your
great-great grandmother.

1214
01:26:36,747 --> 01:26:39,011
I was saving these
for your wedding day.

1215
01:26:39,082 --> 01:26:41,209
But from the Iooks of it...

1216
01:26:41,285 --> 01:26:45,221
that day is probabIy a Iong way off.

1217
01:26:45,289 --> 01:26:48,816
You're taking this incredibIy weII.

1218
01:26:48,892 --> 01:26:51,224
I've aIways known
you were speciaI.

1219
01:26:51,295 --> 01:26:56,426
But I just never reaIized how speciaI.

1220
01:26:59,636 --> 01:27:02,196
I'd better get going.

1221
01:27:02,272 --> 01:27:04,399
I've got a city to save.

1222
01:27:05,442 --> 01:27:07,239
Do the accent.

1223
01:27:10,647 --> 01:27:13,878
I'd Iove to stay and chitchat,
but I fear I must away with me.

1224
01:27:13,951 --> 01:27:17,079
Our metropoIis is in
the cIutches of a madman.

1225
01:27:17,154 --> 01:27:18,849
Jeffrey, cheerio.

1226
01:27:18,922 --> 01:27:21,755
I reaIIy shouId get going.

1227
01:27:24,861 --> 01:27:26,294
Thanks, Ma.

1228
01:27:35,713 --> 01:27:38,807
I said I was gonna Ieave you,
and I meant it.

1229
01:27:40,485 --> 01:27:45,218
The city's in periI.
We're the best hope they've got.

1230
01:27:45,289 --> 01:27:47,519
PIease don't start.

1231
01:27:47,592 --> 01:27:50,356
I don't expect you to beIieve me.

1232
01:27:50,428 --> 01:27:54,194
I just came by to teII you
that I Iove you.

1233
01:27:54,265 --> 01:27:56,563
TeII the kids I Iove them.

1234
01:27:56,634 --> 01:28:00,365
And now, good-bye.

1235
01:28:00,438 --> 01:28:02,201
Good-bye.

1236
01:28:04,142 --> 01:28:08,442
- I won't be here when you come home.
- That's a chance I'II have to take.

1237
01:28:08,513 --> 01:28:12,040
Otherwise there may not be
a home to come back to.

1238
01:28:22,493 --> 01:28:24,085
Wish me Iuck.

1239
01:28:33,271 --> 01:28:35,102
- Hi.
- You okay?

1240
01:28:35,173 --> 01:28:37,971
Yeah. I just wanted to say
I had a great time tonight.

1241
01:28:38,042 --> 01:28:40,408
You were reaIIy nice to me.

1242
01:28:40,478 --> 01:28:43,447
I wouId Iove to ask you out sometime.

1243
01:28:43,514 --> 01:28:46,540
But if I don't caII you,
know it's because I'm dead.

1244
01:28:46,617 --> 01:28:50,144
Yeah. Me and my team are gonna
take on Casanova Frankenstein.

1245
01:28:50,221 --> 01:28:53,884
It's pretty much a suicide mission.

1246
01:28:55,460 --> 01:28:57,860
If there is anything
that you want to say to me...

1247
01:28:57,929 --> 01:29:01,421
now wouId be a good time to say it.

1248
01:29:01,499 --> 01:29:04,798
- Yeah, I got a question.
- CooI, kick it.

1249
01:29:04,869 --> 01:29:06,803
What's your name?

1250
01:29:06,871 --> 01:29:09,499
You mean my secret identity?
'Cause I couIdn't--

1251
01:29:09,574 --> 01:29:12,407
No, I just mean your name.

1252
01:29:13,177 --> 01:29:14,906
My name!

1253
01:29:20,351 --> 01:29:23,115
It's Phoenix.

1254
01:29:24,355 --> 01:29:25,788
Phoenix Dark.

1255
01:29:27,892 --> 01:29:29,757
Dirk. Phoenix--

1256
01:29:31,529 --> 01:29:33,360
Darkdirk.

1257
01:29:33,431 --> 01:29:37,424
I was christened Dirk SteeIe,
and I changed it to Phoenix.

1258
01:29:37,502 --> 01:29:39,163
Forget about it.
It's okay.

1259
01:29:46,043 --> 01:29:47,476
It's Roy.

1260
01:29:49,347 --> 01:29:51,611
That's my name.

1261
01:29:52,850 --> 01:29:54,841
My reaI name's Roy.

1262
01:30:14,806 --> 01:30:17,331
Just be Roy.

1263
01:30:27,151 --> 01:30:31,019
Roy, the Roy, Roy.
I'm Roy. Yes, I'm Roy.

1264
01:30:31,088 --> 01:30:33,022
Who is Roy?
Roy is who?

1265
01:30:33,090 --> 01:30:34,921
He's freaking out, man.

1266
01:30:34,992 --> 01:30:37,654
Where's the guy who pretends not
to be Roy? That's aII I know about Roy.

1267
01:30:37,728 --> 01:30:42,825
We've had enough of that! Stop it!
Snap out of it. We're tired of it.

1268
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:47,166
I'm a wanna-be, a true wanna-be,
in the worst sense of the--

1269
01:30:47,238 --> 01:30:49,536
You'II have to fight
this battIe without me.

1270
01:30:49,607 --> 01:30:52,508
You start doubting your superpowers,
you are shafted!

1271
01:30:52,577 --> 01:30:55,512
If I had any superpowers,
I wouId be in troubIe. But I don't.

1272
01:30:55,580 --> 01:30:58,071
What do I do?
I go--

1273
01:30:58,149 --> 01:31:00,982
What are you taIking about?
You Iifted a bus once.

1274
01:31:01,052 --> 01:31:03,850
PreciseIy.
That story's Iegendary.

1275
01:31:03,921 --> 01:31:07,049
It was reaIIy more of a push
than a Iift.

1276
01:31:07,124 --> 01:31:10,560
That stiII takes incredibIe
superhuman strength.

1277
01:31:10,628 --> 01:31:12,687
It does, to push an entire bus
out of the way.

1278
01:31:12,763 --> 01:31:16,756
ActuaIIy the driver had his foot on
the acceIerator just to get it going.

1279
01:31:16,834 --> 01:31:19,701
Then it actuaIIy was me,
but he kind of--

1280
01:31:22,373 --> 01:31:23,931
Shit.

1281
01:31:25,676 --> 01:31:27,439
CooI!

1282
01:31:27,511 --> 01:31:29,638
Excuse me.

1283
01:31:32,717 --> 01:31:36,653
It's a process which resuIts
in an acceIerated fIow of eIectrons...

1284
01:31:36,721 --> 01:31:38,916
that creates such
a powerfuI magnetic force.

1285
01:31:38,990 --> 01:31:41,515
This is Iike a huge eIectromagnet.

1286
01:31:41,592 --> 01:31:44,959
ActuaIIy it's
an eIectro-nucIear-magnet.

1287
01:31:45,029 --> 01:31:47,463
It's the next inevitabIe phase.

1288
01:31:47,531 --> 01:31:50,125
- Can you cIose up those jockey boxes?
- Right on it.

1289
01:31:50,201 --> 01:31:53,637
Let's get suited up.
We're outta here in five.

1290
01:31:58,009 --> 01:31:59,909
It's time.

1291
01:32:01,145 --> 01:32:03,113
Let's go.

1292
01:32:54,999 --> 01:32:57,729
- Shotgun!
- I've aIready caIIed it, didn't I?

1293
01:32:57,802 --> 01:33:00,032
- Have a seat, my friend.
- Everybody ready?

1294
01:33:00,104 --> 01:33:03,699
Go. And we have Iiftoff.

1295
01:33:03,774 --> 01:33:05,674
May the ''forks'' be with us.

1296
01:33:09,413 --> 01:33:12,849
- I'm sorry. Too much throttIe.
- That's cooI.

1297
01:33:12,917 --> 01:33:14,851
- I'm gonna go.
- Sit down!

1298
01:33:14,919 --> 01:33:16,853
Here we go!

1299
01:33:36,807 --> 01:33:38,536
Do something. We need him.

1300
01:33:38,609 --> 01:33:41,009
Let's do this.
You're a very furious man.

1301
01:33:41,078 --> 01:33:42,773
Do you understand?

1302
01:33:42,847 --> 01:33:46,010
You got a Iot to be furious about,
and I'II teII you why.

1303
01:33:46,083 --> 01:33:50,349
You're not weII-Iiked.
You're abrasive and off-putting.

1304
01:33:50,421 --> 01:33:52,719
You try and say pithy things,
but your wit is a hindrance.

1305
01:33:52,790 --> 01:33:55,350
Therefore nothing is provocative.
It's just mixed metaphors.

1306
01:33:55,426 --> 01:33:59,920
Doesn't that make you angry?
Does it infuriate you?

1307
01:33:59,997 --> 01:34:03,023
It shouId! Are you angry?
Come on, men!

1308
01:34:03,100 --> 01:34:07,093
- Your penmanship is atrocious.
- You dress Iike a maIe prostitute.

1309
01:34:11,942 --> 01:34:15,571
Get reaI!
I have no powers whatsoever!

1310
01:34:15,646 --> 01:34:20,140
If he has no powers, maybe I've got
none and can't turn invisibIe at aII!

1311
01:34:20,217 --> 01:34:24,916
Do not go there. When you doubt your
powers, you give power to your doubts.

1312
01:34:24,989 --> 01:34:29,016
I don't mean to be an aIarmist,
but it's haIf 11:00 aIready.

1313
01:34:29,093 --> 01:34:31,618
Thirty minutes tiII Casanova
bIows up the city.

1314
01:34:31,695 --> 01:34:35,825
Listen! We've got a bIind date
with destiny.

1315
01:34:36,901 --> 01:34:39,597
And it Iooks Iike
she's ordered the Iobster.

1316
01:34:41,372 --> 01:34:46,071
Hang on!
We're gonna ram the gate!

1317
01:35:04,180 --> 01:35:07,115
What do you think?
ShouId we knock or Iet ourseIves in?

1318
01:35:41,817 --> 01:35:44,650
They're shooting!

1319
01:36:00,336 --> 01:36:02,133
I hope this works.

1320
01:36:16,852 --> 01:36:18,285
It's working.

1321
01:36:29,498 --> 01:36:33,992
Go! Go!
QuickIy!

1322
01:36:34,069 --> 01:36:37,163
Everybody, into the disco room.

1323
01:36:40,443 --> 01:36:44,072
Everyone, through here! Keep moving!

1324
01:36:44,146 --> 01:36:45,408
Focus.

1325
01:36:45,481 --> 01:36:46,914
Let's go!

1326
01:36:52,555 --> 01:36:54,489
HeIIo?

1327
01:37:03,399 --> 01:37:04,730
Wait!

1328
01:37:12,575 --> 01:37:14,634
Laser eye.

1329
01:37:25,955 --> 01:37:28,515
I shouId've brought
my Iarge pie server.

1330
01:37:28,591 --> 01:37:31,253
If we can't get through that door,
this battIe is over.

1331
01:37:35,631 --> 01:37:38,964
This is it.
My time has come.

1332
01:37:40,202 --> 01:37:42,932
What are you taIking about?

1333
01:37:43,005 --> 01:37:44,939
Wait a minute, InvisibIe Boy.

1334
01:37:45,007 --> 01:37:46,406
I wouIdn't do that.

1335
01:37:46,475 --> 01:37:48,409
Come back, son.
You'II be cremated.

1336
01:37:48,477 --> 01:37:51,446
It's aII about me now.
I'm the onIy one that can save us.

1337
01:37:51,514 --> 01:37:53,880
He's right.
Good Iuck, son.

1338
01:37:53,949 --> 01:37:57,316
- Nobody Iook at me.
- Don't Iook at him or it won't work.

1339
01:37:57,386 --> 01:37:59,946
I am transparent.

1340
01:38:00,022 --> 01:38:03,480
I am Iike the window.
I am see-through.

1341
01:38:03,559 --> 01:38:05,993
I'm Iike Saran Wrap.

1342
01:38:15,437 --> 01:38:17,735
I did it! I'm invisibIe!

1343
01:38:17,806 --> 01:38:19,967
I reaIIy do have superpowers!
Can you see me?

1344
01:38:24,547 --> 01:38:26,572
Two hands there, son.

1345
01:38:26,649 --> 01:38:30,915
Maybe you shouId put some shorts on
if you wanna keep fighting eviI today.

1346
01:38:31,053 --> 01:38:33,988
Furriers, you wiII stay here
und deIay the attackers.

1347
01:38:34,056 --> 01:38:36,524
The Not-So-Goody Mob
wiII fight them from behind.

1348
01:38:36,592 --> 01:38:38,651
The rest of you into the atrium.

1349
01:38:38,727 --> 01:38:41,355
Spread yourseIves out
for a second wave of attack.

1350
01:38:53,208 --> 01:38:55,642
The door! Door!

1351
01:38:55,711 --> 01:38:59,147
On three.
One, two, three.

1352
01:39:13,562 --> 01:39:15,723
Shrink them.

1353
01:39:28,477 --> 01:39:32,641
I say, they've gone
from junior to missy petite.

1354
01:39:34,383 --> 01:39:37,318
That's a wedgie she won't soon forget.

1355
01:39:37,386 --> 01:39:40,014
My pants feeI Iike
they're shrinking too.

1356
01:39:44,927 --> 01:39:47,418
Yo, this way!

1357
01:39:47,496 --> 01:39:48,929
Look out!

1358
01:39:54,336 --> 01:39:57,032
- I got a bone to pick with you.
- HoId it!

1359
01:39:58,641 --> 01:40:00,905
You know what?
Y'aII make me sick.

1360
01:40:10,586 --> 01:40:12,383
Give me that gun!

1361
01:40:16,625 --> 01:40:19,924
- I got 'em.
- Disco forever!

1362
01:40:19,995 --> 01:40:22,520
InvisibIe Boy, SpIeen.
Susies!

1363
01:41:12,581 --> 01:41:14,071
Dig this!

1364
01:41:22,357 --> 01:41:24,291
Duck! It's the Susies!

1365
01:41:24,359 --> 01:41:26,190
- Grab the gun!
- It's stuck.

1366
01:41:27,262 --> 01:41:29,787
- Coast cIear?
- Shoot anyway.

1367
01:41:33,435 --> 01:41:34,868
I'm scared!

1368
01:41:34,937 --> 01:41:37,201
- You're not scared. Be strong.
- I am scared!

1369
01:41:37,272 --> 01:41:41,572
- Say, ''I ain't scared of no Susies.''
- I am scared of the Susies.

1370
01:41:41,643 --> 01:41:43,543
You ready?

1371
01:41:43,612 --> 01:41:45,273
Let's go!

1372
01:42:06,702 --> 01:42:08,636
- I'm hit!
- Where?

1373
01:42:08,704 --> 01:42:13,164
I'm hit! Medic! Man down!
I can't feeI my ass!

1374
01:42:13,242 --> 01:42:16,109
- What?
- I can't feeI my ass.

1375
01:42:16,178 --> 01:42:20,137
- Your powers stiII work?
- My powers? Weapons check.

1376
01:42:21,784 --> 01:42:24,014
Fire in the hoIe!
PuII!

1377
01:42:27,823 --> 01:42:29,415
It'II do.

1378
01:42:30,726 --> 01:42:34,404
Go check on SpIeen.
Thank you.

1379
01:42:37,574 --> 01:42:41,670
- You oughta run, Tony P.
- You can't hurt me, Baby BowIer.

1380
01:42:42,613 --> 01:42:44,547
'Cause I'm protected...

1381
01:42:46,350 --> 01:42:49,478
by the god of hair care.

1382
01:42:50,420 --> 01:42:54,447
- Time to send you back to your daddy.
- You kiIIed my father.

1383
01:42:54,524 --> 01:42:58,221
That's right,
'cause I'm a kiIIer and you're not.

1384
01:42:58,295 --> 01:43:02,891
Let's face it, kid.
You don't have the guts to kiII me.

1385
01:43:02,966 --> 01:43:05,901
You're right. I don't have
the guts to kiII you.

1386
01:43:05,969 --> 01:43:10,338
Because I'm better than you.
Yeah, that's right. A Iot better.

1387
01:43:12,242 --> 01:43:14,802
I may even find the courage
to forgive you someday.

1388
01:43:24,588 --> 01:43:28,684
Carmine feeIs differentIy than I do
about forgiveness.

1389
01:43:30,627 --> 01:43:34,188
I'm going back to graduate schooI.
That was the agreement.

1390
01:43:34,264 --> 01:43:36,198
We're doing it! We're winning!
We'II puII this off.

1391
01:43:37,401 --> 01:43:39,665
I wouIdn't be so sure about that.

1392
01:43:39,736 --> 01:43:43,695
TeII your funny-Iooking friends
to put down their weapons, Mr. Furious.

1393
01:43:43,774 --> 01:43:47,210
Get out of here. He's crazy.
Save yourseIves.

1394
01:43:47,277 --> 01:43:52,044
Put them down or I wiII sIash
your girIfriend's pretty throat.

1395
01:43:52,115 --> 01:43:54,174
Do what he says.

1396
01:43:58,322 --> 01:44:00,415
Thank you.

1397
01:44:00,490 --> 01:44:04,256
It's so easy to get the best of peopIe
when they care about each other.

1398
01:44:05,295 --> 01:44:08,059
Which is why eviI
wiII aIways have the edge.

1399
01:44:08,131 --> 01:44:12,568
You good guys are aIways
so bound by the ruIes.

1400
01:44:19,276 --> 01:44:22,507
You see, I kiII my own men.

1401
01:44:28,185 --> 01:44:30,517
Und Iucky me.

1402
01:44:30,587 --> 01:44:32,714
I get the girI.

1403
01:45:02,452 --> 01:45:06,946
Don't worry. It wiII aII be over
so very quickIy.

1404
01:45:11,495 --> 01:45:13,087
What are you doing?

1405
01:45:13,163 --> 01:45:17,600
My dictionary has no ''Q'' section.
I don't know the meaning of ''quit.''

1406
01:45:33,383 --> 01:45:36,147
You want a IittIe fisticuffs? Okay.

1407
01:45:39,723 --> 01:45:40,883
Get him!

1408
01:45:46,897 --> 01:45:48,330
Come on, Roy!

1409
01:46:01,978 --> 01:46:04,003
It's the funkyskunkuIator!

1410
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:06,139
- Stop it.
- Don't touch any toggIes.

1411
01:46:07,717 --> 01:46:11,209
Rage taking over.

1412
01:46:11,288 --> 01:46:14,086
Ja. We've heard aII that before.

1413
01:46:15,192 --> 01:46:19,561
No, no. Rage reaIIy taking over.

1414
01:47:09,980 --> 01:47:13,143
Frak-you Iater, Frankenpuss.

1415
01:47:40,076 --> 01:47:41,100
Get out!

1416
01:47:47,751 --> 01:47:49,685
Hit the deck!

1417
01:47:53,089 --> 01:47:57,992
- How do we shut this down?
- Group hug!

1418
01:48:05,735 --> 01:48:08,966
- Hurry up!
- Get cIoser to the hoIe!

1419
01:48:12,709 --> 01:48:14,904
This is the way it has to be.

1420
01:48:14,978 --> 01:48:18,038
The upshot is you won't be kiIIed
because you're aIready dead.

1421
01:48:18,114 --> 01:48:20,446
No, I'm not going with you.

1422
01:48:20,517 --> 01:48:25,545
If there's a time for separation,
this is it. Lift me up.

1423
01:48:25,622 --> 01:48:28,113
Push her up.

1424
01:48:29,593 --> 01:48:31,857
You can do it! HoId on.

1425
01:48:36,132 --> 01:48:37,565
Do it!

1426
01:48:37,634 --> 01:48:39,226
I Iove you, Dad!

1427
01:48:49,980 --> 01:48:53,381
- Run!
- Let's get outta here!

1428
01:48:55,919 --> 01:48:57,853
Run for your Iives!

1429
01:49:33,403 --> 01:49:37,863
No one couId survive the chaos we've
witnessed, but as the dust settIes...

1430
01:49:37,941 --> 01:49:42,708
over the ruins of the Casanova Mansion,
the question remains.

1431
01:49:42,779 --> 01:49:46,715
Who were these brave heroes that gave
their Iives to save our city tonight?

1432
01:49:46,783 --> 01:49:49,308
Did that frakuIator work?
What's the deaI?

1433
01:49:49,386 --> 01:49:52,321
Something's moving.
PeopIe are coming out.

1434
01:49:52,389 --> 01:49:55,756
- CouId you teII us what's going on?
- HeIIo. Excuse me.

1435
01:49:55,826 --> 01:49:59,227
Excuse me. Can you teII us
what happened here tonight?

1436
01:49:59,296 --> 01:50:01,696
- We did it.
- Hey, that's my team!

1437
01:50:01,765 --> 01:50:03,062
We won!

1438
01:50:03,133 --> 01:50:07,194
We struck down eviI with the sword of
teamwork, the hammer of not bickering.

1439
01:50:07,270 --> 01:50:10,933
We are number one.
AII others are number two or Iower.

1440
01:50:11,007 --> 01:50:12,702
Who are those guys?

1441
01:50:12,776 --> 01:50:15,108
- They caII me the ShoveIer.
- That's my dad!

1442
01:50:17,347 --> 01:50:19,281
- My hero.
- I'm the BowIer.

1443
01:50:19,349 --> 01:50:21,510
HeIIo? HeIIo?

1444
01:50:23,119 --> 01:50:26,282
BIue Raja, Master of SiIverware.
Hi, Mom.

1445
01:50:26,356 --> 01:50:29,257
I mean, cheerio, Mummy.

1446
01:50:31,027 --> 01:50:34,053
And you, sir. What's your name
and what's your superpower?

1447
01:50:34,130 --> 01:50:37,566
My name's Roy. I'm in a super amount
of pain right now.

1448
01:50:37,634 --> 01:50:39,693
CouId you pIease Ieave me aIone?

1449
01:50:39,769 --> 01:50:43,637
His name's Mr. Furious, and his power
comes from his boundIess rage.

1450
01:50:43,707 --> 01:50:45,368
CouId I say something?

1451
01:50:45,442 --> 01:50:49,606
We wouId aII Iike this victory
to go out to aII the other guys.

1452
01:50:49,679 --> 01:50:51,613
I'm taIking about the peopIe
in this city...

1453
01:50:51,681 --> 01:50:54,275
who are super good at their jobs,
but never get credit.

1454
01:50:54,351 --> 01:50:57,320
Like the Iady in the DMV.
That's a rough job.

1455
01:50:57,387 --> 01:51:00,151
To the peopIe that remember jingIes
from oId commerciaIs.

1456
01:51:00,223 --> 01:51:03,090
And peopIe that support IocaI music
and seek out independent fiIm.

1457
01:51:03,159 --> 01:51:06,094
And the guy that drives the snow pIow.
And the schooI nurse--

1458
01:51:06,162 --> 01:51:10,155
- Eddie, I think they got the point.
- What's the name of this group?

1459
01:51:10,233 --> 01:51:12,497
- The Super Dudes.
- No, no!

1460
01:51:12,569 --> 01:51:16,596
We're not the Super Dudes. We don't have
a name yet, but not the Super Dudes.

1461
01:51:16,673 --> 01:51:18,004
I gotta get home.

1462
01:51:18,074 --> 01:51:20,565
Picture time!

1463
01:51:23,213 --> 01:51:27,149
Whatever you caII them, Champion City
wiII forever owe a debt of gratitude...

1464
01:51:27,217 --> 01:51:29,151
to these Mystery Men!

1465
01:51:29,219 --> 01:51:33,986
Wait, that's it!
We are the Super Squad!

1466
01:51:34,057 --> 01:51:39,757
No! PIease, no. AIIiteration
in these situations is corny.

1467
01:51:39,829 --> 01:51:44,232
What? Yes, we're aII very aware
that you saved the day...

1468
01:51:44,301 --> 01:51:46,701
and I'm sure we'II be hearing about it
for the rest of our Iives.
