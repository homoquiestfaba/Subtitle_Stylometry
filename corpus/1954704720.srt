1
00:00:14,223 --> 00:00:16,959
So the doctor told me,
I needed a transfusion.

2
00:00:16,989 --> 00:00:20,876
What would be no problem,
If I had not rare blood type.

3
00:00:20,906 --> 00:00:25,218
A.B negative. Luckily my cousin Sophia...

4
00:00:25,248 --> 00:00:30,635
she's my mother's side...
Sophia was in town to visit Marilyn.

5
00:00:30,665 --> 00:00:35,636
She lost her cat and
because ours just had a litter...

6
00:00:36,113 --> 00:00:38,464
Do you have a cat, Douglas?

7
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,463
No ma'am, I'm allergic to them.
This is a shame.

8
00:00:42,503 --> 00:00:46,258
A cat can be a good company.

9
00:00:47,251 --> 00:00:50,364
If you come here from around here?
No, no.

10
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,233
Where do you come from?
Mrs. Brennan...

11
00:00:53,273 --> 00:00:58,477
I think it is repaired.
Thank you Douglas.

12
00:00:58,868 --> 00:01:04,348
It's not really logical, an old building
refurbishment, which will be demolished.

13
00:01:05,275 --> 00:01:09,295
How much do I owe you?
Nothing, it's part of my job.

14
00:01:10,977 --> 00:01:14,317
Drink your tea but,
I read the leaves.

15
00:01:17,976 --> 00:01:21,644
I see the letter 'J',
that important to you?

16
00:01:21,674 --> 00:01:23,753
No, not at the moment.

17
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:27,841
It is someone who is very important,
in your life.

18
00:01:27,876 --> 00:01:32,627
Someone you care about very much.
A woman.

19
00:01:32,657 --> 00:01:38,180
No... There was someone,
but it is now.

20
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:43,062
She comes back.
No, Mrs. Brennan...

21
00:01:43,092 --> 00:01:45,859
I do not think that will happen.

22
00:02:19,131 --> 00:02:21,049
Julie?

23
00:02:48,087 --> 00:02:51,313
When I get some heat in this hovel?

24
00:03:01,351 --> 00:03:05,364
<i>Dreams have returned.
But they are our dreams?</i>

25
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:09,642
Julie <i> I saw last night.
She sat in the chair.</i>

26
00:03:09,672 --> 00:03:12,322
<i>Just as I found her that night.</i>

27
00:03:12,352 --> 00:03:15,505
<i>Looking to the heavens
with a bullet hole in her skull.</i>

28
00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:19,962
<i>How did they find me here?</i>

29
00:03:40,088 --> 00:03:44,748
<i>I found Julie's body,
perished in the apartment where we lived.</i>

30
00:03:44,913 --> 00:03:49,750
My revolver <i> verchroomde.38
into clutching her dead.</i>

31
00:04:46,937 --> 00:04:50,628
<i>By then I was convinced
the supernatural was involved...</i>

32
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:53,011
<i>in a very tangible way.</i>

33
00:04:53,171 --> 00:04:56,555
What happened to Julie <i>
and other strange occurrences...</i>

34
00:04:56,585 --> 00:04:59,440
<i>were more frequent.</i>

35
00:05:13,204 --> 00:05:16,574
<i>But the naked truth is,
that I did not care.</i>

36
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:21,047
<i>Julie, was back
and that was the most important.</i>

37
00:05:27,652 --> 00:05:31,410
Hi, sorry to bother you but...

38
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:35,015
I am the key
My apartment forgotten.

39
00:05:35,045 --> 00:05:37,042
Do you mind?

40
00:05:37,427 --> 00:05:39,897
No, no problem.

41
00:05:40,644 --> 00:05:44,167
<i>It seems every girl
I meet reminds me of her.</i>

42
00:05:45,942 --> 00:05:49,083
<i>They say if you love someone,
You should leave them free.</i>

43
00:05:49,184 --> 00:05:52,910
<i>And if they come back,
then they belong to you.</i>

44
00:05:55,207 --> 00:06:00,180
Hey, are you the new caretaker?
Yes, sir, that's me.

45
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:04,491
That we needed that.
A new caretaker.

46
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:09,469
For a building is demolished.
Well, we still have some months to go.

47
00:06:09,568 --> 00:06:14,287
I hope you are better than the latter
concierge. You know what he did?

48
00:06:14,323 --> 00:06:18,118
He had a secret room
down there in the boiler.

49
00:06:18,148 --> 00:06:22,528
Where he kept his girls magazines.
He thought no one knew.

50
00:06:22,558 --> 00:06:27,095
But I do.
I've been here longer than anyone else.

51
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,140
Now they want to throw us all.

52
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:35,449
But I'm not leaving,
before I'm ready.

53
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:39,897
Nice to meet you, sir.
My name is Thompson, Bill Thompson.

54
00:06:39,927 --> 00:06:45,195
You can ask me whatever you want.
I've been here longer than anyone else.

55
00:06:45,225 --> 00:06:49,901
Mr. Thompson, I still have a
contract to renovate this building to...

56
00:06:49,931 --> 00:06:53,793
and there is still some on my list.
So if you do not mind...

57
00:06:54,323 --> 00:06:58,069
I'm very polite goodbye.

58
00:06:58,109 --> 00:07:02,425
I know everything that happens here.

59
00:07:03,344 --> 00:07:08,457
For example, I know that there
a homeless girl living downstairs...

60
00:07:08,487 --> 00:07:12,794
in that room at the end of the hall.
Yeah, I know. I'm going down...

61
00:07:12,851 --> 00:07:16,443
and I will be recording.
You have a nice day, Mr. Thompson.

62
00:07:16,483 --> 00:07:20,885
If you want to know about 'the Hagstone"
then you ask me.

63
00:08:35,573 --> 00:08:37,341
Can I help you?

64
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:42,503
There are some neighbors complained about you, okay?
I see it like this...

65
00:08:42,575 --> 00:08:46,240
They're going to demolish this building,
So you can stay here.

66
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:50,925
But, stay out of sight
and keep your head down, okay?

67
00:08:51,371 --> 00:08:53,169
You're welcome.

68
00:08:54,877 --> 00:08:58,474
Can you fix my toilet, Douglas?
Excuse me?

69
00:08:58,619 --> 00:09:02,500
My lovely little toilet,
it does not flush well.

70
00:09:02,534 --> 00:09:05,774
Do not you think you are a little too far?

71
00:09:05,928 --> 00:09:09,541
Tonight can not.
How about tomorrow night?

72
00:09:09,571 --> 00:09:15,255
No, not tomorrow. The next few days
I am out of town, so I'm sorry.

73
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:20,409
That's okay. Then I have to
the gas station down the street.

74
00:09:21,517 --> 00:09:23,095
Good night.

75
00:09:58,377 --> 00:10:04,359
We are still playing. I expel In one U.S. dollar.
Let's see whether that is enough.

76
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:08,103
<i>Carl was ordained a priest,
around the time that Julie died.</i>

77
00:10:08,133 --> 00:10:11,750
<i>I did not believe in that religious crap
and he knew it.</i>

78
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,703
I pass. I wonder what you got?

79
00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:16,489
<i>Three farmers.
Yes, three farmers.</i>

80
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:23,250
Three women.
I once had a queen.

81
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:28,526
<i>Carl, Julie's brother,
So just about family.</i>

82
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,125
Will you play another?

83
00:10:30,155 --> 00:10:33,468
What does your brother for a living, Carl?

84
00:10:33,498 --> 00:10:37,144
He is now in caretaker
an apartment building, right? But...

85
00:10:37,174 --> 00:10:40,063
He was a famous journalist.
Oh, you mean that?

86
00:10:40,093 --> 00:10:43,108
Yes, a big boy.
Hey, can I decide?

87
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:44,884
Then you must answer quickly.

88
00:10:46,606 --> 00:10:49,639
Share your are, or what?
I'm sorry, man.

89
00:10:50,885 --> 00:10:53,279
- It's all right.
- I get though.

90
00:10:53,843 --> 00:10:57,266
Okay, one more round.
Another round.

91
00:10:57,443 --> 00:10:59,715
The last, give Carl, maps, please.

92
00:11:07,531 --> 00:11:09,639
- How are you?
- Hey, Carl...

93
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,900
I've already told you,
what a great brother you are?

94
00:11:13,107 --> 00:11:15,190
I want you to know.

95
00:11:17,952 --> 00:11:22,428
Carl, I've seen her, really.

96
00:11:23,087 --> 00:11:26,097
I've seen Julie.

97
00:11:46,568 --> 00:11:50,635
<i>After that night, I knew that Carl,
was not the one who would help me.</i>

98
00:11:51,438 --> 00:11:54,493
<i>He did not believe how real,
Julie for me.</i>

99
00:11:55,421 --> 00:11:58,252
He would never know <i>
how much I loved her.</i>

100
00:11:58,694 --> 00:12:02,238
<i>Nothing in this world
between two people in love are.</i>

101
00:12:02,268 --> 00:12:05,026
Not even a damn grave <i>.</i>

102
00:12:24,847 --> 00:12:28,865
Come here.

103
00:12:39,668 --> 00:12:41,626
Got a light?

104
00:12:47,219 --> 00:12:49,703
Do not you cold, here?

105
00:12:50,031 --> 00:12:55,733
No, I'm lonely.
Have you ever been lonely?

106
00:12:56,942 --> 00:13:01,553
Only when I think of it.
Would you like some coffee?

107
00:13:01,683 --> 00:13:03,713
I can not go in.

108
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:11,585
$ 20 and we are
Neither lonely anymore.

109
00:13:13,946 --> 00:13:17,476
Please, I'm cold.

110
00:13:35,475 --> 00:13:39,999
Damn it. What the hell are you?

111
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:43,432
I... I can not.

112
00:13:45,928 --> 00:13:48,440
You owe me $ 20.

113
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:06,192
Douglas? He has done it again.

114
00:14:13,344 --> 00:14:18,532
Now, that has been there two days.

115
00:14:19,536 --> 00:14:22,465
Okay, Mrs. Brennan, I'll settle.

116
00:14:24,449 --> 00:14:26,691
Mr. Witkowsky?

117
00:14:31,059 --> 00:14:33,388
Mr. Witkowsky?

118
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:41,206
Mr. Witkowsky...

119
00:14:46,194 --> 00:14:48,230
Mr. Witkowsky.

120
00:15:08,672 --> 00:15:10,780
Mr. Witkowsky?

121
00:15:15,063 --> 00:15:17,789
Dear Jesus.

122
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:21,303
Mrs. Brennan, you want here
probably not come.

123
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,578
Dear Jesus.

124
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:36,950
I always knew he masturbated.

125
00:16:01,006 --> 00:16:05,569
My little Victoria.
I'd have to call her Houdini.

126
00:16:11,132 --> 00:16:15,943
Do you like cats?
No, I'm allergic.

127
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:20,733
I'm allergic to them.
Are you scared of me?

128
00:16:20,763 --> 00:16:24,731
Why?
What was all the excitement last night?

129
00:16:24,771 --> 00:16:30,340
That was Mr. Witkowsky,
they said he had a heart attack.

130
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:35,519
These are his clothes. I need to contact
the poor devil his family.

131
00:16:35,936 --> 00:16:38,619
Tonight would be perfect, Douglas.

132
00:16:39,809 --> 00:16:43,211
- What?
- For toilets.

133
00:16:43,321 --> 00:16:48,366
Oh yes, that's the toilet.
Sorry, tonight?

134
00:16:48,886 --> 00:16:54,485
Yes, tonight would be perfect.
How about 19:00?

135
00:16:55,353 --> 00:16:57,702
Do not be late.

136
00:17:08,057 --> 00:17:12,273
Hello?
Hello, John Witkowsky, the brother of Sam.

137
00:17:12,313 --> 00:17:15,056
Are you the caretaker?
Yes sir, I am.

138
00:17:15,096 --> 00:17:19,670
My mother and I come along to his stuff
to pick and I...

139
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:22,957
and I wish you a favor.
Whatever you want.

140
00:17:22,987 --> 00:17:26,320
It is a little sensitive,
I can count on your discretion?

141
00:17:26,442 --> 00:17:27,997
This allows you

142
00:17:28,037 --> 00:17:33,645
I hope no unpleasant surprises
to find the apartment of Sam.

143
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:38,306
No embarrassing discoveries.
I understand completely.

144
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,503
And you will not regret.

145
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:07,274
- Hello?
- Douglas? Come inside.

146
00:18:15,338 --> 00:18:18,776
She wants you to eat her.
Do you mind?

147
00:18:18,816 --> 00:18:20,737
It's in the fridge.

148
00:18:26,959 --> 00:18:29,891
No, great.

149
00:18:41,568 --> 00:18:43,700
<i>Come here, Douglas.</i>

150
00:18:54,274 --> 00:18:58,610
You do not mind that I
formatting while you work? I'm late.

151
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,044
You should do what you do.

152
00:19:03,036 --> 00:19:06,220
It seems that only
the chain off cases.

153
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:21,684
I'm sorry that I did not before.
That gas station was determined no fun?

154
00:19:22,647 --> 00:19:27,477
I just, Sam used the toilet.
Sam?

155
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:32,516
- Witkowsky.
- Mr. Witkowsky?

156
00:22:42,999 --> 00:22:45,919
<i>I have the gun, today
exactly one year ago buried.</i>

157
00:22:47,571 --> 00:22:50,819
<i>And then I buried her.</i>

158
00:22:52,022 --> 00:22:56,563
<i>But sometimes takes a turn death
and comes straight at you.</i>

159
00:22:56,593 --> 00:23:01,135
<i>Then you have two choices. You may be
afraid and stabbing your head in the sand.</i>

160
00:23:02,065 --> 00:23:06,507
<i>Or you can keep the wheel straight
and accelerate.</i>

161
00:23:07,533 --> 00:23:10,793
<i>I was not on the night she Julie
driven to suicide.</i>

162
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:14,326
<i>I lay half-conscious on the back
of a Buick, ready for demolition.</i>

163
00:23:17,007 --> 00:23:22,405
<i>But one thing I know for sure.
It was their fault.</i>

164
00:24:59,374 --> 00:25:03,241
I do not think it is on the phone.
I will check the central point...

165
00:25:03,281 --> 00:25:06,352
but if the problem is between here
and there, I can not help it.

166
00:25:06,382 --> 00:25:08,704
Then I have someone to call.

167
00:25:10,608 --> 00:25:13,903
How do you here? Do you job?

168
00:25:14,135 --> 00:25:19,852
Yeah, I mean the building feels
good, you know. Absolutely.

169
00:25:20,175 --> 00:25:25,843
The tenants are nice, most of it.
Some are eccentric but...

170
00:25:25,873 --> 00:25:29,100
that's probably all true. If only
not someone always on your door slams...

171
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:32,650
- it will go.
- It's true.

172
00:25:32,689 --> 00:25:36,796
And what are you doing?
What I do?

173
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:40,489
Yes.
I am a nurse, I work at night.

174
00:25:40,794 --> 00:25:45,249
Mrs. Thomas Brennan fits.
She takes care of him often.

175
00:25:46,025 --> 00:25:49,065
And she has cats, so he likes
to go there and play with them.

176
00:25:49,095 --> 00:25:51,856
Yes, I've seen her cats.

177
00:25:53,417 --> 00:25:57,730
He is a bit shy
but it's a good kid.

178
00:25:58,487 --> 00:26:01,248
He also has a good mother.

179
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:37,386
- Douglas...
- Yes, Mrs. Brennan?

180
00:26:37,416 --> 00:26:41,148
You listen us?
No, Mrs. Brennan...

181
00:26:41,188 --> 00:26:43,779
Mrs. Holloway has some problems
with the phone.

182
00:26:44,219 --> 00:26:48,875
Barbara.
Well, that's a nice girl.

183
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:54,627
Not like those below.
That cheap, dirty blonde?

184
00:26:54,657 --> 00:26:57,934
Yes, those cheap, dirty blondes
need somewhere to live.

185
00:26:57,964 --> 00:27:02,861
And that ridiculous cat hair is also release.
I just saw him in the laundry room.

186
00:27:02,901 --> 00:27:05,350
I will look at it, Mrs. Brennan.

187
00:27:05,529 --> 00:27:12,378
Thomas, you go and clean up stuff on.
And then I will become a lunch for you.

188
00:27:14,086 --> 00:27:18,198
Douglas, I think this woman might
a prostitute.

189
00:27:18,238 --> 00:27:21,696
I've seen her take men away.
Men who looked good.

190
00:27:21,726 --> 00:27:26,844
With suits and ties.
I know nothing of, Mrs. Brennan.

191
00:27:26,874 --> 00:27:31,247
Last night, she took a male.
I looked through my kitchen window.

192
00:27:31,277 --> 00:27:35,786
They came in a white car
and that car is still there.

193
00:27:35,816 --> 00:27:39,569
Mrs. Brennan, I think I
but once that cat go searching.

194
00:27:41,123 --> 00:27:43,763
<i>Here, kitty...</i>

195
00:27:47,062 --> 00:27:49,363
<i>Here, kitty...</i>

196
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:59,357
Damn... Tory?

197
00:28:01,009 --> 00:28:04,684
Victoria? Here, kitty...

198
00:28:12,631 --> 00:28:15,255
Damn it.

199
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:03,940
- You forgot this.
- Thank you.

200
00:29:07,272 --> 00:29:13,095
Are you asking me inside.
Of course, follow your heart.

201
00:29:18,262 --> 00:29:22,073
Sorry for all my properties
that are lying around.

202
00:29:23,226 --> 00:29:27,895
Do you drink?
Yeah, I need some whiskey.

203
00:29:50,525 --> 00:29:54,904
How does your toilet it?
Excellent.

204
00:30:11,372 --> 00:30:16,004
Have you recently seen a pussy.
What?

205
00:30:17,757 --> 00:30:21,772
A girl, you know what that is, right?

206
00:30:23,023 --> 00:30:25,849
Yes, I can vaguely remember something.

207
00:30:35,329 --> 00:30:39,669
- Do you?
- Do I what?

208
00:30:39,699 --> 00:30:45,516
Seen a kitten?
I have one myself.

209
00:30:45,556 --> 00:30:51,310
Yes, some people have good luck. Do you know
anything about the white Buick, outside?

210
00:30:54,343 --> 00:30:59,398
Mrs. Brennan asked for it. I thought,
that maybe your friends were.

211
00:31:00,247 --> 00:31:03,859
Well, Mrs. Brennan has it wrong.

212
00:31:06,987 --> 00:31:09,483
So, what do you think?

213
00:31:10,095 --> 00:31:12,396
Where?

214
00:31:16,321 --> 00:31:20,245
What's so funny?
I... I do not know.

215
00:31:21,563 --> 00:31:24,040
Do I scare you, Douglas?

216
00:31:27,169 --> 00:31:30,539
Is something bothering you, honey?

217
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:35,207
Yes, I do not know what happens to me.

218
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:40,352
But let me go my way.

219
00:32:02,708 --> 00:32:04,464
Shit.

220
00:32:14,785 --> 00:32:20,632
So you think that Mrs. Brennan alone?
Yes, to my knowledge.

221
00:32:20,931 --> 00:32:24,891
No signs of forced entry into the building,
the locks or windows?

222
00:32:25,252 --> 00:32:29,411
No visitors in her apartment?
No strangers hanging around?

223
00:32:29,451 --> 00:32:32,951
Detective, almost everyone here is
almost a stranger to me.

224
00:32:32,981 --> 00:32:37,750
Yes, why?
I am here only briefly.

225
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:42,803
How long have you been in this building?
Soon, a few months.

226
00:32:42,833 --> 00:32:46,482
And before that?
You know, here and there.

227
00:32:46,522 --> 00:32:52,405
Do you now what to stay longer? Not
really, they demolish the building soon.

228
00:32:52,435 --> 00:32:55,439
Where are you going, Douglas?

229
00:32:55,479 --> 00:32:58,384
Come detective, I'm not waiting.

230
00:32:58,414 --> 00:33:01,873
I still have 6 mugs, AB negative
to mop up for dinner.

231
00:33:01,903 --> 00:33:06,518
Well, you only mopping up blood.

232
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:10,206
Talk to you later.
Have a nice day.

233
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:21,560
Karna?

234
00:34:27,094 --> 00:34:28,919
Karna?

235
00:35:30,307 --> 00:35:34,802
Are we still doing it or what?
My plane leaves in a few hours.

236
00:35:35,855 --> 00:35:38,496
A few hours, huh?

237
00:35:39,585 --> 00:35:42,298
Do you think you can stand it for so long?

238
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:52,731
<i>Pull him out. Yes...</i>

239
00:36:40,261 --> 00:36:44,600
<i>Deaths Mary Ann Riley.</i>

240
00:37:10,948 --> 00:37:14,594
Hi, Douglas.
I'm sorry to disturb you, but...

241
00:37:15,164 --> 00:37:18,289
- Is there a problem?
- No, I...

242
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,784
Okay, why do not you come inside?

243
00:37:26,101 --> 00:37:29,385
- Do you drink?
- Yes, please.

244
00:37:34,329 --> 00:37:36,077
A beautiful space.

245
00:37:37,026 --> 00:37:40,072
It looks forward to
that a bachelor lives here.

246
00:37:41,681 --> 00:37:46,364
Are you a writer?
I try now and then.

247
00:37:46,394 --> 00:37:50,890
Sorry it's so cold here.
I do like the cold.

248
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,723
Okay.

249
00:37:55,578 --> 00:37:59,489
So... Where is Thomas?

250
00:37:59,919 --> 00:38:03,762
He is my mother.
I got to rest for you.

251
00:38:03,792 --> 00:38:05,401
Yes.

252
00:38:07,534 --> 00:38:12,147
I could not go, I work at night.
It must be tough.

253
00:38:12,177 --> 00:38:14,281
Yes.

254
00:38:31,002 --> 00:38:35,211
It'll be fine with him.

255
00:38:35,788 --> 00:38:41,211
I'm sorry Mrs. Brennan.
It must be hard for you.

256
00:38:41,251 --> 00:38:43,574
Especially for Thomas.

257
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:03,958
I saw you talking with that detective.
What did he say?

258
00:39:03,988 --> 00:39:09,804
They treat each case as murder.
He asked some questions and...

259
00:39:10,674 --> 00:39:13,977
He told me that she would speak,
whatever that may mean.

260
00:39:20,919 --> 00:39:25,236
Douglas, I must tell someone.

261
00:39:28,568 --> 00:39:34,166
I've seen things in my apartment.

262
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:47,314
Yes, I'm sorry, Barbara.
I think it's better when you leave.

263
00:40:06,248 --> 00:40:10,206
<i>Barbara, was a nice woman.
A good woman.</i>

264
00:40:10,614 --> 00:40:15,889
But there were <i> ugly things to happen.
I had to take her away.</i>

265
00:40:16,026 --> 00:40:20,420
And treat her like shit <i>.
I wanted out of her picture.</i>

266
00:40:29,741 --> 00:40:33,398
Would you like some tea...
Douglas.

267
00:40:33,438 --> 00:40:36,279
Would you like some tea, Douglas?
No, thank you, Mrs. Riley.

268
00:40:36,722 --> 00:40:41,032
How long have you been for the newspaper, Douglas?
I do not really, sir.

269
00:40:41,072 --> 00:40:43,767
I make a freelance article.

270
00:40:43,955 --> 00:40:47,501
And you also said you had a love,
who committed suicide?

271
00:40:47,541 --> 00:40:50,297
Yes ma'am, my wife.

272
00:40:50,337 --> 00:40:53,880
I know this is painful for you
And I appreciate you taking time.

273
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:56,814
Bring it on. Ask what you want.

274
00:40:57,345 --> 00:41:01,073
It is very difficult
to explain this, but...

275
00:41:01,113 --> 00:41:05,204
have you ever
thought to the possibility that...

276
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:10,011
Your daughter could still live?
What do you say?

277
00:41:11,694 --> 00:41:14,197
That her own death,
has put in scene.

278
00:41:14,288 --> 00:41:18,957
That is nonsense.
I know, sorry, I did not...

279
00:41:18,997 --> 00:41:22,857
Would you like a cookie or...
No, thank you ..

280
00:41:23,288 --> 00:41:26,337
I...
You'd better leave immediately.

281
00:41:26,377 --> 00:41:31,721
I'm sorry sir.
I would ask one may ask?

282
00:41:32,228 --> 00:41:36,748
Why did your daughter
to exhume and cremate?

283
00:41:37,072 --> 00:41:38,940
What are you talking about?

284
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:42,399
I was in the cemetery.
You were in the cemetery?

285
00:41:42,429 --> 00:41:45,680
Yes sir, I am gone.
I do not know what you intend...

286
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:49,857
but I warn you
You come here with the weird stories...

287
00:41:49,897 --> 00:41:54,758
Mr. Riley, I've been to the cemetery
and I saw the open grave.

288
00:41:55,368 --> 00:41:58,417
I'm sorry, I thought you knew.
Are you sure?

289
00:41:58,447 --> 00:42:01,555
Yes, sir, I'm sure.
I call our lawyer.

290
00:42:02,305 --> 00:42:07,603
<i>I had the vague feeling that the Rileys,
told me everything about her death.</i>

291
00:42:08,999 --> 00:42:11,470
<i>And because the authorities still
drew nearer...</i>

292
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:15,219
<i>I knew that it was better
I quickly found an answer.</i>

293
00:43:04,227 --> 00:43:07,860
Douglas.
Detective, what brings you here?

294
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:11,142
I was just nearby.

295
00:43:11,182 --> 00:43:14,027
I tried to reach you,
but your phone is locked.

296
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:17,033
Yes, it happens,
if you do not pay the bill.

297
00:43:17,714 --> 00:43:21,310
Come, step.

298
00:43:23,266 --> 00:43:26,217
- I have a choice?
- Of course.

299
00:43:27,016 --> 00:43:31,120
Am I arrested?
Would you be arrested?

300
00:44:01,801 --> 00:44:05,882
No milk and no sugar, right?
Black.

301
00:44:06,362 --> 00:44:08,750
If the night.

302
00:44:09,216 --> 00:44:13,524
- You know her?
- Jesus Christ.

303
00:44:14,597 --> 00:44:17,732
I do not know. You do not know.

304
00:44:17,762 --> 00:44:22,517
Were you not with a prostitute in Heads
Water Truck Stop, the 16th of this month?

305
00:44:24,066 --> 00:44:28,208
Yeah, I mean is that a crime?
Yes, that's a crime.

306
00:44:28,516 --> 00:44:33,864
Yes, I know, but really, literally,
regarding sex crimes and so...

307
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:38,307
But what I meant is that they
whether we, as you say...

308
00:44:38,347 --> 00:44:40,911
have the 'act' is not practiced.

309
00:44:42,068 --> 00:44:45,389
Three dead in ten days, Douglas.

310
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:48,911
All in one way or another
In connection with you.

311
00:44:49,627 --> 00:44:55,413
You know, even my wife Lucille,
which has a very open mind.

312
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:59,026
Even they would say
this is more than coincidence.

313
00:45:00,246 --> 00:45:04,023
The death of your wife.
There was never an autopsy, right?

314
00:45:04,053 --> 00:45:07,941
- No.
- Well, that will change.

315
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:11,791
This is an order of excavation.
I open the case again.

316
00:45:11,821 --> 00:45:13,834
You can not do.
I've already done.

317
00:45:13,874 --> 00:45:17,491
I love you from, I get a lawyer.
What?

318
00:45:17,521 --> 00:45:19,906
You can not even your phone bill.

319
00:45:21,756 --> 00:45:24,668
Is there anything you
I would like to tell, Douglas?

320
00:45:24,698 --> 00:45:29,137
Okay, there's that woman,
who lives in the building.

321
00:45:29,177 --> 00:45:35,150
Her name is Karna.
She lives in apartment three.

322
00:45:35,342 --> 00:45:39,660
Her real name is...
Apartment three, which must be empty.

323
00:45:40,247 --> 00:45:45,042
That's right, it should be free.
But that girl is there withdrawn.

324
00:45:45,082 --> 00:45:49,754
It seems that there are more unoccupied
In that old building Hagstone now.

325
00:45:49,784 --> 00:45:53,169
- Can I go?
- Listen, you...

326
00:45:53,975 --> 00:45:58,276
If you do not already know, are you now
an official suspect in this case.

327
00:45:58,316 --> 00:46:03,678
The only thing I have not, is a motive.
But that will come with time.

328
00:46:12,358 --> 00:46:15,968
Going back to The <i> Hagstone,
always made me feel secure.</i>

329
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:21,346
<i>It was like a fortress for my soul.</i>

330
00:46:22,874 --> 00:46:26,392
<i>A place for my memories and where Julie,
wandering through the endless corridors.</i>

331
00:46:26,422 --> 00:46:29,507
And I stared <i>
the black frozen windows.</i>

332
00:46:29,547 --> 00:46:34,560
<i>Hagstone As long as we had
Julie and I were always together.</i>

333
00:47:20,411 --> 00:47:22,786
Hi, I'm John Witkowsky,
are you the caretaker?

334
00:47:22,816 --> 00:47:26,117
Yes, I'm Douglas.
Here, this is for the effort.

335
00:47:26,147 --> 00:47:29,797
No, you do not have to.
This is my mother.

336
00:47:29,827 --> 00:47:34,875
Pleasant, madam.
She is not well off, recently.

337
00:47:34,905 --> 00:47:40,059
Douglas, do you know whether my brother
dealt with someone, had a girlfriend?

338
00:47:41,636 --> 00:47:45,728
No, I would not say.
It is because credit card statements...

339
00:47:45,758 --> 00:47:50,123
that seemed to...
Well, we should get going.

340
00:47:50,153 --> 00:47:53,599
Mother, it's time to go.
Thank you again.

341
00:48:39,536 --> 00:48:43,540
Barbara, you were just in my apartment?
Of course not.

342
00:48:45,493 --> 00:48:50,005
I advise you, now leave the building.
What's going on?

343
00:48:50,081 --> 00:48:54,310
Barbara, go away, go to your son.
Would you tell me what's going on?

344
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:56,948
You should leave the building right now.

345
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:05,277
- We need to talk.
- Fuck off.

346
00:49:07,473 --> 00:49:10,770
You look bad, Douglas.
You need a drink, I think.

347
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,363
I do not drink.
I want you to leave this damn building.

348
00:49:13,393 --> 00:49:17,497
Why do not you sit down?
Sit down.

349
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:21,679
Victoria. There you are.

350
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:25,426
- I know who you are.
- Really?

351
00:49:26,055 --> 00:49:30,352
And who am I?
You are Mary Ann Riley.

352
00:49:30,382 --> 00:49:34,390
I do not know why or how, but you put
your own death scene 3 years ago.

353
00:49:34,916 --> 00:49:38,264
And what does it matter you?
That would not be...

354
00:49:38,294 --> 00:49:42,498
but I'm pretty sure that when you
Two murders, perhaps three are involved.

355
00:49:43,408 --> 00:49:47,400
How many are you involved there?
What?

356
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:52,882
What do you mean that?
Was it a sick joke or something?

357
00:49:54,272 --> 00:49:58,538
Why do not you drink? Drink.

358
00:50:05,027 --> 00:50:07,784
I want to show you something, Douglas.

359
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:06,790
<i>Greet and eat...</i>

360
00:52:10,946 --> 00:52:14,953
<i>Greet and eat...</i>

361
00:54:26,434 --> 00:54:31,156
Douglas? What are you doing?

362
00:54:33,462 --> 00:54:36,820
Who are you thinking you are?

363
00:54:43,534 --> 00:54:49,350
I am a good person.
That is a joke.

364
00:54:53,474 --> 00:54:56,520
I am a good person.

365
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,761
How are you?
Do you want coffee?

366
00:55:31,506 --> 00:55:36,727
Where am I?
My doorbell rang at 05.00.

367
00:55:36,767 --> 00:55:38,982
I opened the door and there you were.

368
00:55:40,674 --> 00:55:44,415
I told you to go away?
I'm leaving tomorrow.

369
00:55:45,047 --> 00:55:50,550
That's better.
And I also think you should leave.

370
00:55:52,206 --> 00:55:56,430
That does not, I have a contract.
I am the caretaker.

371
00:55:56,534 --> 00:56:01,445
Douglas, the heater does not work,
There is no one, outside of you and me...

372
00:56:01,485 --> 00:56:04,341
and the blonde woman down.

373
00:56:06,315 --> 00:56:10,690
Karna, that's me one, right?
Listen...

374
00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:13,216
You have to get out, Douglas.

375
00:56:14,108 --> 00:56:19,157
And if you like you can with me.
No, I'm sorry, Barbara.

376
00:56:19,197 --> 00:56:22,963
I am not so.
I have some things to do.

377
00:56:23,543 --> 00:56:26,175
Where are my glasses?

378
00:56:27,972 --> 00:56:31,330
I think you get it, but
to regulate all.

379
00:56:32,367 --> 00:56:35,220
Yeah, I think I should do it.

380
00:56:38,345 --> 00:56:40,576
Where are my boots?

381
00:58:52,915 --> 00:58:55,457
<i>Douglas...</i>

382
00:59:23,065 --> 00:59:27,538
She's gone.

383
00:59:27,568 --> 00:59:31,389
Douglas, I want to help.
How can I help?

384
00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:40,379
I want you to bring me somewhere.
Okay.

385
01:00:12,651 --> 01:00:17,401
I'm sorry Barbara, this must be strange.
It's okay.

386
01:00:18,312 --> 01:00:22,725
What does she know, Douglas?
Not much.

387
01:00:37,689 --> 01:00:39,891
What's going on?

388
01:00:42,670 --> 01:00:45,027
Are you sure you want to know?

389
01:00:48,017 --> 01:00:50,589
Yes, I'm sure.

390
01:00:55,170 --> 01:01:01,100
My sister Julie was a Satanist.
What?

391
01:01:02,350 --> 01:01:05,650
She and Douglas participated
to a fertility ritual satanic...

392
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:11,686
a baby can get.
But the child was not meant for them.

393
01:01:12,885 --> 01:01:16,969
The child should be sacrificed
on a black altar.

394
01:01:17,506 --> 01:01:21,372
Are you serious?

395
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:24,637
That can not be true.

396
01:01:27,438 --> 01:01:31,612
And the sacrifice to be valid...

397
01:01:33,898 --> 01:01:36,509
Both parties must agree.

398
01:02:01,608 --> 01:02:06,122
Barbara...
Douglas has a "demon" in his soul.

399
01:02:06,185 --> 01:02:11,177
And that soul is in great danger.
And he will need.

400
01:02:12,382 --> 01:02:16,313
You must decide whether you
it can do for him.

401
01:02:20,525 --> 01:02:22,773
I think I can.

402
01:04:51,185 --> 01:04:55,446
How do you feel?
They dig her, Carl.

403
01:04:55,486 --> 01:05:01,440
That's what they wanted all along.
That the police would dig it.

404
01:05:01,958 --> 01:05:07,455
They want the body of Julie.
We must stop them.

405
01:05:08,522 --> 01:05:12,271
They want us, Douglas.
No, they want her.

406
01:05:12,301 --> 01:05:17,180
Why is this happening.
What is happening?

407
01:05:19,543 --> 01:05:24,800
The ritual failed. Julie was not pregnant,
There has never been a child.

408
01:05:25,350 --> 01:05:28,449
The whole group witnessed its failure.

409
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:33,844
And so she committed suicide.
Why did not stop there?

410
01:05:34,607 --> 01:05:39,500
By me, I brought her body
and burial.

411
01:05:39,530 --> 01:05:42,329
What does that make?

412
01:05:42,741 --> 01:05:48,300
Julie, was sworn in to the group.
They shot himself down, with my gun.

413
01:05:48,869 --> 01:05:54,302
And because she committed suicide, was
her body to target for a takeover.

414
01:05:54,671 --> 01:05:59,805
The acquisition, which?
A succubus.

415
01:05:59,835 --> 01:06:03,483
What is a succubus?
A demon prostitute.

416
01:06:03,783 --> 01:06:09,079
They want to Julie what I did.
That's what they always wanted.

417
01:06:29,207 --> 01:06:32,516
I told you, there is his car.

418
01:06:34,709 --> 01:06:36,256
The car from whom?

419
01:06:37,074 --> 01:06:42,316
Of the detective, they will dig Julie.
I have to stop them.

420
01:07:02,214 --> 01:07:04,712
My God.

421
01:07:06,602 --> 01:07:08,905
My God.

422
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:13,293
It's okay, Bar.

423
01:07:43,779 --> 01:07:47,893
- I want to see my son.
- Yes.

424
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:53,626
You must go now.
We need all of this behind us.

425
01:07:59,339 --> 01:08:02,244
And when we do, it starts
then all over again?

426
01:08:07,210 --> 01:08:11,886
Maybe we should face it.
Maybe that's the best.

427
01:08:17,335 --> 01:08:19,468
I will help you.

428
01:08:34,761 --> 01:08:38,303
It looks abandoned.
I'll be the first to enter.

429
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:43,730
No, let me go.
Why do not we together?

430
01:08:55,769 --> 01:08:59,665
Okay, we start over.

431
01:09:00,105 --> 01:09:05,225
Douglas, an idea began with the acquisition?
I do not know.

432
01:09:06,902 --> 01:09:11,518
How do you feel?
I've never felt better.

433
01:09:11,548 --> 01:09:16,288
It's the building, Douglas.
You take her energy.

434
01:09:17,148 --> 01:09:20,150
I go get the flashlight.

435
01:09:24,909 --> 01:09:29,005
We do get the lights back on,
The fuse box is this way.

436
01:10:25,682 --> 01:10:28,333
It seems that everyone is gone,
that path should be.

437
01:10:28,363 --> 01:10:31,621
Douglas, come on. We must
find a focal point and begin.

438
01:10:31,661 --> 01:10:35,165
Well, think.
They should have given you a hint.

439
01:10:35,355 --> 01:10:39,755
Mr. Thompson, you're still here.
Who is Mr. Thompson?

440
01:10:39,785 --> 01:10:44,665
A crazy, old tenant.
Why would he be here?

441
01:10:45,346 --> 01:10:49,156
I do not know. He wants to remain in
the building, even if they demolish.

442
01:10:49,186 --> 01:10:53,630
He spoke of a caretaker,
who collected porn magazines...

443
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:58,398
in a warehouse or something.
We would ask him.

444
01:10:58,438 --> 01:11:01,201
Let's start there. That's good.

445
01:11:35,824 --> 01:11:37,840
Mr. Thompson?

446
01:12:06,822 --> 01:12:08,968
Mr. Thompson?

447
01:12:15,665 --> 01:12:17,851
Mr. Thompson?

448
01:12:20,742 --> 01:12:22,901
Mr. Thompson?

449
01:12:24,844 --> 01:12:28,292
Sorry madam, I did not
mean to frighten you.

450
01:12:29,261 --> 01:12:31,216
Well...

451
01:12:31,523 --> 01:12:37,480
It seems that I have some company,
in this old, empty building.

452
01:12:38,302 --> 01:12:42,485
What can I do for you?
Sorry to disturb us, Mr. Thompson.

453
01:12:42,525 --> 01:12:46,821
This is Barbara Holloway, of apartment 12.
Mrs.

454
01:12:47,118 --> 01:12:49,577
And my brother, Carl.

455
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:53,998
Padre... The case is that we...

456
01:12:54,028 --> 01:12:57,494
have to find something in the building.
And I remember that you offered...

457
01:12:57,534 --> 01:13:03,252
history to explain, and so on.
Of course, sure.

458
01:13:03,772 --> 01:13:09,048
I know everything you need to know
the old Hagstone.

459
01:13:12,805 --> 01:13:16,777
I've been here before all else
came to live here.

460
01:13:17,101 --> 01:13:20,007
And now they think
they can throw me out.

461
01:13:20,047 --> 01:13:24,750
Only by a piece of paper
hanging on the door.

462
01:13:25,134 --> 01:13:28,539
Well, they still have to endure.

463
01:13:28,579 --> 01:13:31,434
I'm not going away.

464
01:13:31,645 --> 01:13:36,409
I remember you saying something about
a hidden storage space, or something?

465
01:13:36,439 --> 01:13:42,310
Yeah, sure.
That was the old caretaker.

466
01:13:42,453 --> 01:13:44,839
Who was for you.

467
01:13:45,152 --> 01:13:49,442
He kept all its leaves,
with women there.

468
01:13:49,627 --> 01:13:54,411
He went over there always
and pulled away throughout the afternoon.

469
01:13:54,439 --> 01:14:00,420
I will tell you that he is the master,
all had masturbator.

470
01:14:00,775 --> 01:14:06,200
They were disturbed that finally caught,
to tear off the hall on the second floor.

471
01:14:06,357 --> 01:14:10,365
That's why he eventually got the sack.

472
01:14:10,395 --> 01:14:14,115
Where do we find space?
Where is it?

473
01:14:14,145 --> 01:14:18,850
Listen, you're done here.

474
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:22,662
Why do not you to me?

475
01:14:23,076 --> 01:14:25,504
Demon...

476
01:14:27,697 --> 01:14:32,953
Leave this body, be damned!

477
01:14:37,982 --> 01:14:40,071
Douglas.

478
01:14:46,121 --> 01:14:50,074
Let me go. Let me go.

479
01:14:50,588 --> 01:14:52,529
Let me go.

480
01:14:54,974 --> 01:14:57,414
Hold it, Douglas.

481
01:15:03,866 --> 01:15:05,677
Come on, together.

482
01:15:07,324 --> 01:15:09,273
What is this?

483
01:15:22,844 --> 01:15:25,811
Pull it down.

484
01:15:33,954 --> 01:15:37,705
I got it. Forwards.

485
01:15:41,643 --> 01:15:45,173
I recommend you to call your name,
You evil spirit.

486
01:15:56,471 --> 01:15:59,066
I drive you out.

487
01:15:59,910 --> 01:16:04,391
The satanic forces of the enemy.
And all your evil minions...

488
01:16:04,421 --> 01:16:07,550
In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

489
01:16:07,858 --> 01:16:13,840
For that he who commands.
He who expelled them from heaven...

490
01:16:15,037 --> 01:16:17,648
to the depths of hell.

491
01:16:27,568 --> 01:16:30,177
It's ready now.

492
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:49,364
Who was that?

493
01:16:51,005 --> 01:16:55,395
That was the pimp of Karna.
My God.

494
01:16:56,647 --> 01:16:59,135
He's dead now.

495
01:17:02,897 --> 01:17:06,612
We need to find space,
and fast.

496
01:17:06,642 --> 01:17:10,788
Douglas, you said
it was near the boiler room.

497
01:17:11,337 --> 01:17:15,312
But there's nothing there.
I know that area at all.

498
01:17:17,776 --> 01:17:20,433
There must be another way.

499
01:17:25,312 --> 01:17:27,987
Maybe I know.

500
01:17:31,186 --> 01:17:36,404
It is here, this is the crawl space.
The boiler room is on the other side.

501
01:17:36,444 --> 01:17:42,430
Douglas, I'll go with you.
No, Carl, I see them with the flashlight.

502
01:18:06,524 --> 01:18:10,855
She's here. I see her.

503
01:18:13,117 --> 01:18:17,005
It seems like they changed.
Douglas, I'm coming down.

504
01:18:17,035 --> 01:18:21,112
No, do you close the hatch
and let her have not.

505
01:18:21,222 --> 01:18:24,448
I'm here to once and for all
an end to it.

506
01:18:25,463 --> 01:18:28,518
Do it now.

507
01:23:36,068 --> 01:23:38,126
Julie...

508
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:46,718
Barbara.

509
01:23:51,292 --> 01:23:53,053
No.

510
01:25:06,743 --> 01:25:08,690
My God.

511
01:25:54,202 --> 01:25:58,312
- It's over.
- No, Carl.

512
01:25:58,342 --> 01:26:00,505
You are not dying.

513
01:26:02,263 --> 01:26:04,468
Yes, I'll go.

514
01:26:05,598 --> 01:26:10,763
You must start a new life.

515
01:26:13,784 --> 01:26:16,767
You have that chance.

516
01:26:22,742 --> 01:26:25,006
Which you deal.

517
01:26:29,078 --> 01:26:31,741
It came in the mail.

518
01:26:32,398 --> 01:26:36,000
But then I found out
Julie was dead.

519
01:26:41,324 --> 01:26:43,384
Douglas...

520
01:26:45,688 --> 01:26:49,086
There's only one way to kill a demon.

521
01:26:51,346 --> 01:26:54,172
You throw him into the fire.

522
01:26:55,964 --> 01:26:58,011
Walk away.

523
01:28:19,407 --> 01:28:21,426
Douglas.

524
01:28:26,223 --> 01:28:32,650
She is, it is Victoria.
You have to kill her.

525
01:28:42,977 --> 01:28:45,411
Get away from her.

526
01:28:49,756 --> 01:28:54,378
I said, get away from her.
Douglas.

527
01:28:57,189 --> 01:29:01,601
I, Barbara.

528
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:40,775
<i>We must finish this.</i>

529
01:29:45,082 --> 01:29:47,896
<i>I'll help.</i>

530
01:31:40,107 --> 01:31:43,943
<i>As I stood there, looking
the Hagstone, I felt happy.</i>

531
01:31:44,107 --> 01:31:46,968
<i>Fortunately, because I had a place at my
bad memories to leave...</i>

532
01:31:46,998 --> 01:31:49,186
<i>and able to walk away.</i>

533
01:31:51,009 --> 01:31:55,408
<i>The thing that would haunt me.
Was about to be demolished.</i>

534
01:31:57,358 --> 01:32:00,270
<i>It is better not to look back.</i>

535
01:32:08,159 --> 01:32:13,084
<i>So for the next poor devil
who comes, remember this...</i>

536
01:32:13,114 --> 01:32:16,236
<i>Hey everybody, look who's back.</i>

537
01:32:17,544 --> 01:32:21,344
<i>Somewhere, the thing that
the body of my wife managed...</i>

538
01:32:21,384 --> 01:32:24,163
<i>you try to play.</i>

539
01:32:24,621 --> 01:32:29,265
It is unimaginable the bloody reality.
