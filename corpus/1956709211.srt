1
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:08,641
- Could you do a reading now?

2
00:00:08,741 --> 00:00:09,842
- Yeah.

3
00:00:09,942 --> 00:00:11,477
Please have a seat.

4
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:53,720
Death.

5
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:59,926
It refers to loss.

6
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:03,096
You've experienced
loss, a great loss.

7
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:12,138
The 10 of cups.

8
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:16,943
This card, with the death card,
refers to love.

9
00:01:18,177 --> 00:01:21,681
You've lost someone you loved.

10
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:25,151
Someone from your future
is now in your past.

11
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:34,494
The hanged man.

12
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,497
It's not a bad card.

13
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:40,733
But it refers to blockage.

14
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:44,003
You need to grieve
to be able to move forward.

15
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:48,574
The hermit.

16
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:53,146
Time. Time is very important.

17
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:58,017
There's corruption. Something
is being concealed from you.

18
00:01:59,585 --> 00:02:02,889
It's very important
that you act cautiously.

19
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:07,727
Your intuition, your instinct,
will come into play here.

20
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,699
- It's OK. That's enough.

21
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,469
- But... we
haven't finished.

22
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:19,505
- It's all right.

23
00:02:19,605 --> 00:02:21,741
Thank you for your time.

24
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:36,956
Sorry I'm late.

25
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:38,191
- That's OK!

26
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,192
- OK!

27
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:40,827
- I ordered us
crab salad.

28
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:43,696
- Oh, great! Yeah.

29
00:02:44,897 --> 00:02:46,032
- So?

30
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:47,200
What'd she say?

31
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,535
- Oh, there's
nothing to tell.

32
00:02:49,635 --> 00:02:51,637
- [Chuckling]:
Oh, no, no, no.

33
00:02:51,737 --> 00:02:54,240
That's not what
I paid $100 for.

34
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,542
- It's impossible
to tell anything

35
00:02:56,642 --> 00:02:58,711
from a worn-out deck
of playing cards, Mother.

36
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:00,580
- It's Tarot, darling.

37
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,148
Tarot.

38
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:03,816
[ Chuckling ]
- Ladies?

39
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,017
- Thank you.

40
00:03:05,117 --> 00:03:05,985
- And
bon appÃ©tit.

41
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:07,954
- Thanks.

42
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:10,990
- So what about Italy?
What's happening with the trip?

43
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,959
- Yeah! I, um...
I made a reservation.

44
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:15,161
I'm just...
I haven't decided.

45
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:16,762
- What are you
waiting for? Go!

46
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,231
Go! Explore!

47
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,567
- It would be nice
to get away.

48
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:23,603
- It sure would!

49
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,137
And don't let
anything stop you.

50
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:26,205
Understand?

51
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,275
- Yes, Mother.

52
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,245
- Good! Mmm, this
is delicious, hmm?

53
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,781
- Mmm!

54
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:43,256
- No, there's
nobody else.

55
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:46,692
- Yeah? Yeah,
I just got here myself.

56
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:50,162
So CSI's all done
taking their pictures, right?

57
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:51,330
All right.

58
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,335
So let's see what we got here.

59
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:23,696
- Detective Ortuso!

60
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:24,697
- Yeah?

61
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:26,332
It's freezing tonight!

62
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:33,873
So how long do you figure?

63
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:39,679
- Not long.
Couple hours, max.

64
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,882
- Well, there's no signs
of a struggle. No wounds.

65
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:44,984
No blood, except
for that nosebleed.

66
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:47,687
- We'll take him in.
Get a closer look.

67
00:04:58,965 --> 00:04:59,999
- Mrs. Brooks?

68
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:01,267
- Yeah?

69
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:03,836
- I'm Detective
Ortuso, Chicago PD.

70
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:05,905
May I come in?

71
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:07,239
- Uh... yeah!

72
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:13,646
Is there a problem?

73
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:15,815
- Can we go
sit down somewhere?

74
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,250
- Yeah, sure.

75
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:24,423
Please, have a seat.

76
00:05:24,523 --> 00:05:25,791
- Thanks.

77
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:34,367
Samuel Brooks.
Is he your husband?

78
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:38,304
- Was. He passed away
5 years ago.

79
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:41,340
- Uh, really?

80
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:46,846
We found the body of a man

81
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:49,181
who died earlier tonight
at the waterfront.

82
00:05:49,281 --> 00:05:52,151
I have reason to believe
this may be your husband.

83
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:53,319
- No. That must be a mistake.

84
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,189
- Well, this man had
no identification on him,

85
00:05:57,289 --> 00:05:59,191
except for this medical bracelet

86
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,293
with your phone number on it.

87
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,962
Which is how I found you.

88
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:09,201
You recognize it?

89
00:06:09,301 --> 00:06:11,737
- It was his bracelet, but--

90
00:06:11,837 --> 00:06:12,972
- Look.

91
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:14,040
If it's a mistake,

92
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,241
we'll get it all cleared up.

93
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:17,176
But in the meantime,

94
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:19,745
I'm gonna need you to come down
and identify this body.

95
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,352
I'll get my things.

96
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:43,169
- So you're quite certain.

97
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:46,172
- Yeah.

98
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,345
- I'm very sorry
for your loss.

99
00:06:56,982 --> 00:06:58,284
Have a seat, Mrs. Brooks.

100
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:12,298
Look, I know this must be
a terrible shock for you.

101
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:19,405
- I don't--
I don't understand.

102
00:07:21,907 --> 00:07:24,276
- I do have to ask you
a few questions.

103
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,013
- OK.

104
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,349
- So when exactly was the last
time you saw your husband?

105
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:36,288
- Sam died 5 years ago.

106
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,058
Or...

107
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:42,161
So-- so I thought.

108
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:44,363
- Actually, your husband
came here to Chicago

109
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:46,298
from Detroit earlier today.

110
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:49,835
On a one-way ticket.

111
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:55,374
You wouldn't happen to know why
he was coming here, would you?

112
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:58,377
- I-- I...

113
00:07:58,477 --> 00:08:00,846
I already told you,
Detective, I--

114
00:08:00,946 --> 00:08:03,082
- Or what he was doing
down at the waterfront?

115
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:07,319
- I already thought he was dead.

116
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:32,571
- It appears your husband
died of a massive coronary.

117
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:36,408
So... we won't be
performing an autopsy.

118
00:09:36,508 --> 00:09:39,478
Did your husband have any
medical problems, Mrs. Brooks?

119
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:41,280
- Yeah, Sam had, um...

120
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,349
high blood pressure
and diabetes.

121
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:45,084
- Yeah, well,
that'll do it.

122
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:48,053
As I understand it...

123
00:09:48,153 --> 00:09:50,623
Your husband went missing

124
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,992
on April 13, 1999. Am I right?

125
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,494
It was thought to be
a boating accident?

126
00:09:55,594 --> 00:09:56,695
- Yes.

127
00:09:56,795 --> 00:09:58,397
- Yeah.

128
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:05,704
Forgive me for asking, but...

129
00:10:05,804 --> 00:10:09,108
You did receive his life
insurance benefits, am I right?

130
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:12,077
- Meaning what?

131
00:10:12,177 --> 00:10:13,412
- I was simply pointing out,

132
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:15,514
the insurance company
won't be too happy

133
00:10:15,614 --> 00:10:17,316
to learn they
paid death benefits

134
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,285
for someone who wasn't dead yet!

135
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:22,621
- Are you suggesting we cheated
the insurance company?

136
00:10:22,721 --> 00:10:24,056
Is that what you think?

137
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:25,190
Detective, I need help

138
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,358
finding out what happened.

139
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,160
Are you gonna
help me, or not?

140
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,395
- The coroner ruled

141
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:31,463
your husband's death
is a natural cause.

142
00:10:31,563 --> 00:10:34,600
So unless something
would indicate otherwise,

143
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,468
there's not a lot more I can do!

144
00:10:36,568 --> 00:10:39,071
- Meaning there'll
be no investigation.

145
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:41,440
- Unless something turns up, no!

146
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:46,445
- OK.

147
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:51,050
- Uh, Mrs. Brooks?

148
00:10:57,589 --> 00:11:00,326
Look. I can't get personally
involved, you understand?

149
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,463
But this guy...
he may be able

150
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:06,632
to help you
find some answers.

151
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:07,666
Give him a call.

152
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,321
- Thank you.

153
00:11:29,421 --> 00:11:31,056
- [Waiter]: There you go.

154
00:11:31,156 --> 00:11:32,424
- How you doing?

155
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:37,696
- This feels like
a bad dream, you know?

156
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:41,166
One that I can't
wake up from.

157
00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:42,401
- Well...

158
00:11:43,635 --> 00:11:45,504
At least you know
the truth about Sam.

159
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,109
- What's that
supposed to mean?

160
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:54,079
- Sometimes you think
you really know someone,

161
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:55,581
like, you really know them,

162
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:58,817
but in the end...
you really don't.

163
00:11:58,917 --> 00:12:01,186
- Sam loved me!

164
00:12:01,286 --> 00:12:03,555
- I'm...
I'm sure he did.

165
00:12:03,655 --> 00:12:05,290
In his own way.

166
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,726
- Why do you always
have to qualify everything?

167
00:12:07,826 --> 00:12:09,461
- Well, I hate to say it,

168
00:12:09,561 --> 00:12:11,597
but obviously you didn't
know everything about Sam!

169
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:14,700
I'm sorry, honey.

170
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,069
It's just that
I think you should...

171
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:19,671
You've got to put all this
behind you once and for all!

172
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:23,242
- Five years,
in the blink of an eye?

173
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:25,811
- I think you
have to try.

174
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:30,449
Jean, I love you more
than anything in the world.

175
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:32,418
And I don't want you
to be hurt anymore!

176
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:36,722
I want you
to move on, you know?

177
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:38,457
I want you to let it go!

178
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:40,125
It'll be for the best.

179
00:12:40,225 --> 00:12:42,294
You'll see.

180
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:44,730
- I don't think
I can quite yet.

181
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,299
- Where are you going?
You're not staying for lunch?

182
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,101
- I can't stay.
I have an appointment.

183
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:50,502
- Jean...

184
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,615
- Are you Mr. Fate?

185
00:13:03,715 --> 00:13:05,717
- Yeah, you can
call me Eddie.

186
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:07,286
Coffee, or a drink,
or something?

187
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:09,755
- Oh, no, no,
I'm fine. Thanks.

188
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:12,357
I was expecting
someone a bit older.

189
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,726
- Yeah. We private
detectives

190
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:16,628
come in all shapes,
sizes, and ages.

191
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:21,166
You got my card from
Oscar Ortuso, Chicago PD, right?

192
00:13:21,266 --> 00:13:22,334
- Yeah.

193
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:23,402
- Wanna grab a seat?

194
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:24,903
- Yeah, sure. Thanks.

195
00:13:32,544 --> 00:13:36,648
- So... you told me a bit
about your situation.

196
00:13:36,748 --> 00:13:39,151
- How'd you get
the name Fate?

197
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:41,620
- Everyone always
asks me that.

198
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,589
It's my real last name.
It's weird, huh?

199
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,825
Believe me, I've
heard all the jokes.

200
00:13:46,925 --> 00:13:48,560
- I bet.

201
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,930
- Yeah. Tell me about
your... your husband.

202
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,266
- Sam was a doctor.

203
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:56,635
Uh... we lived
here in Chicago.

204
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:58,203
We were very happy.

205
00:13:58,303 --> 00:14:00,572
- What changed?

206
00:14:00,672 --> 00:14:03,475
- He walked out the door,
and I never saw him again.

207
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:07,479
Our boat was found
out on the lake.

208
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:10,182
The propellers were
tangled in some weeds.

209
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:12,918
The police think that...
maybe he got into the water

210
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,320
to fix it,
and drowned.

211
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,456
- And now he turns up
5 years later.

212
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:21,360
I found the rental car,
like the plane ticket,

213
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,361
was paid for in cash.

214
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,298
I don't think your husband
wanted anyone to know

215
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:27,533
he was coming to Chicago.

216
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:29,902
What we have to find out
is why he was here.

217
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:35,274
Look, I'm sorry
I have to ask this, but...

218
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,809
Was there anybody that your
husband might have been seeing?

219
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:38,810
- No.

220
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:40,445
- I see.

221
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,614
Did he have
any other family?

222
00:14:42,714 --> 00:14:45,284
- Uh, yeah. He had
a half-sister, Denise,

223
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,618
who lived in Detroit.

224
00:14:46,718 --> 00:14:50,589
I never met her, but, um...

225
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:53,325
They didn't get along,
from what I understand.

226
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:54,626
I don't know
where she is now.

227
00:14:54,726 --> 00:14:56,595
I need to find out

228
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:58,463
why the man
I loved left me.

229
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:02,668
What he's been
doing since...

230
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:04,770
Did he ever
really love me,

231
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,872
or was our entire
marriage a lie?

232
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:12,411
I need some
answers, Mr. Fate.

233
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:16,481
- Yeah. I have
a bit already.

234
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,951
One thing:
There's no record

235
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:21,587
of a Sam Brooks living
in or near Detroit.

236
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,789
It's... it's funny.

237
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:25,557
In fact, there's no record

238
00:15:25,657 --> 00:15:27,259
of him living
anywhere in the state.

239
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:28,627
It's almost like
he didn't exist.

240
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:29,928
I'm sorry.

241
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:33,632
How 'bout
I fly to Detroit,

242
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:36,935
take a look around,
see what I can find out.

243
00:15:37,035 --> 00:15:38,470
- Thank you.

244
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,740
Uh, do you need
your fee up front, or...

245
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,041
- Oh, no, no.

246
00:15:43,141 --> 00:15:45,277
I just need
some expense money.

247
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:46,678
I drink a lot of coffee.

248
00:15:46,778 --> 00:15:48,313
[ Both chuckling ]

249
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:57,656
- Yeah, I need
to cancel my flight.

250
00:15:57,756 --> 00:16:00,859
Uh, I don't know when
I'll be able to re-book.

251
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,596
OK. Thank you.

252
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:47,472
- [Man in crowd]:
Yeah!

253
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:52,711
- So I guess you owe
me a referral fee!

254
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:55,514
- You're drinking it!

255
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:57,783
Hey, what do you make

256
00:16:57,883 --> 00:16:58,917
of this whole
thing, Oscar?

257
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,454
- I don't know, Eddie.

258
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:04,656
I got mixed feelings
about this thing.

259
00:17:04,756 --> 00:17:08,026
Maybe her husband picked
a strange way to ditch her.

260
00:17:08,126 --> 00:17:09,661
But on the other hand,

261
00:17:09,761 --> 00:17:11,997
the Brooks woman probably
collected a million dollars

262
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:13,699
when her husband went missing!

263
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:16,835
Now, 5 years later,
he's back here to collect.

264
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:19,438
- I don't think so.
No, I believe her.

265
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,640
- Don't underestimate
the money factor.

266
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,843
It can make normal people
do very abnormal things.

267
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:27,846
- Not with this woman.

268
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:29,614
No, it's not
about the money.

269
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,983
For her, it's about
loss and betrayal.

270
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,022
- That's why I gave
her your card.

271
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:39,057
Now, you just
go out there,

272
00:17:39,157 --> 00:17:41,526
and you bring me back
some answers, all right?

273
00:17:41,626 --> 00:17:42,561
- Yeah.

274
00:17:53,805 --> 00:17:55,907
- Is there anything
I can do to help

275
00:17:56,007 --> 00:17:57,142
with the funeral
arrangements?

276
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:01,513
- No, it's fine, Mom.
I have everything handled.

277
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:05,617
- You know...

278
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:08,754
Burying Sam might
actually be therapeutic.

279
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:11,022
You know, a kind of
closure, if you will?

280
00:18:12,824 --> 00:18:16,094
- It's hard to just close
the door on what happened.

281
00:18:16,194 --> 00:18:19,030
- But... wouldn't it
be better to just

282
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:21,600
remember the good times?

283
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,702
And let...
let all the rest go?

284
00:18:27,672 --> 00:18:29,474
- I've hired
a private detective.

285
00:18:35,046 --> 00:18:37,149
- Why?

286
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:40,452
You may find out some things
you'd rather not know!

287
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:43,922
- I have to find out
what happened.

288
00:18:45,056 --> 00:18:46,491
I have no other choice.

289
00:18:56,234 --> 00:18:57,936
- Mrs. Brooks!

290
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:01,973
Hi. Um... can I get
you some coffee?

291
00:19:02,073 --> 00:19:03,508
- Oh no, I'm fine.

292
00:19:03,608 --> 00:19:05,076
- You sure?
It's no problem.

293
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:06,778
- No, I'm here
to sign the paperwork

294
00:19:06,878 --> 00:19:08,847
to release my husband's
body for the funeral.

295
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,148
- Right.

296
00:19:12,884 --> 00:19:14,186
Have a seat, please.

297
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:24,930
I'm afraid
that's not possible.

298
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:28,099
- Why is that?

299
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:33,071
- Your husband's remains
were, uh...

300
00:19:33,171 --> 00:19:35,040
picked up about an hour ago
by someone else.

301
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,075
I tried to phone you.

302
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,213
- By whom?

303
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:45,517
- Charlotte Porter,
from Detroit.

304
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:51,289
- I-- I don't know who that is!

305
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,526
- She was his new wife.

306
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:56,094
Now, from what I understood,
she produced

307
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:57,696
all the right paperwork,

308
00:19:57,796 --> 00:19:59,664
so there was really nothing
anyone could do.

309
00:19:59,764 --> 00:20:00,832
It's too late.

310
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,836
I'm really sorry about this.

311
00:20:04,936 --> 00:20:06,638
- Wait... wait a minute.

312
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,707
From what you understood?

313
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:10,041
- Yeah. Uh...

314
00:20:10,141 --> 00:20:11,543
I wasn't here.

315
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:12,911
I found out about it myself

316
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:14,246
this morning when I got in.

317
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:44,776
-
CCA Flight 20 to Detroit,

318
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:47,178
final boarding
at gate number 8.

319
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:52,584
- Jean!

320
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:01,259
Hey! I wasn't expecting
to see you here.

321
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:03,361
- I've decided
to come with you.

322
00:21:03,461 --> 00:21:06,364
- OK. No problem.
They're boarding right now.

323
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:28,987
- What's up, yo?

324
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:30,355
- Yo, man, what's up?

325
00:21:32,223 --> 00:21:35,393
- Are you serious?
Is this where we're staying?

326
00:21:35,493 --> 00:21:37,295
- Since you hadn't
planned on being with me,

327
00:21:37,395 --> 00:21:38,897
I just thought
I'd stay here.

328
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:41,099
No need to waste your money
on an expensive hotel.

329
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:47,172
- Could we find a place
a little more inviting?

330
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:49,841
- Pretty inviting.

331
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:52,944
You should put my name
on both rooms.

332
00:21:53,044 --> 00:21:54,179
Safer.

333
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:55,847
- OK.

334
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:59,651
- There you go.
Rooms 1421 and 1423

335
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:02,654
are next to each other.
The elevators are to your right.

336
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:04,356
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

337
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:07,192
- All right,
I guess we're set!

338
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:09,060
- We should see
the wife tonight.

339
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,195
- Tonight?

340
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:13,231
We should
call her first.

341
00:22:13,331 --> 00:22:16,334
- Well, personally, I like
the element of surprise.

342
00:22:16,434 --> 00:22:19,137
- I'm exhausted. Can we do it
first thing in the morning?

343
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:21,206
- Yeah. Yeah.

344
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:25,343
How 'bout a nightcap?

345
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:33,985
- Uh, can I have
a mineral water, please?

346
00:22:34,085 --> 00:22:34,919
- Coffee.

347
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,091
So, Charlotte Porter.

348
00:22:40,191 --> 00:22:42,027
Does the name mean
anything to you?

349
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:44,329
- No, never heard it
before in my life.

350
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:49,300
God, I can't believe
this is happening.

351
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:52,737
- I'm sure it's difficult
to take at times.

352
00:22:52,837 --> 00:22:54,806
- This isn't the truth!

353
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:56,074
It can't be.

354
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:57,976
- Seems like it.

355
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:00,278
They were married.

356
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:02,981
- I can't accept that
Sam was unfaithful to me.

357
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:05,817
- It's human nature to believe
what you want to believe.

358
00:23:07,118 --> 00:23:09,988
- You're quite the
philosopher, Mr. Fate.

359
00:23:11,222 --> 00:23:13,858
- You could say I'm a student
of human behaviour.

360
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:16,428
- So what made you become
a private investigator?

361
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:19,964
- Uh, by default.

362
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,000
I was...

363
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,403
...shall I say, excused
from police service a while ago.

364
00:23:25,503 --> 00:23:27,172
- You mean fired.

365
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:30,275
It's called
a euphemism, I believe?

366
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:33,945
- [Chuckling]: Caught.

367
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,148
Well...

368
00:23:37,248 --> 00:23:38,316
Here's to finding the truth.

369
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:41,019
- To finding the truth.

370
00:23:46,991 --> 00:23:48,159
- You know what?

371
00:23:48,259 --> 00:23:49,027
I'll be right back.

372
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:50,795
I'm just gonna
check something out.

373
00:23:50,895 --> 00:23:52,163
- OK.

374
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:16,221
Hey!

375
00:24:17,555 --> 00:24:18,356
- Hey.

376
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,059
How'd you sleep?

377
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:22,994
- Oh, not so bad.
Should we get a taxi?

378
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:24,095
- I got a rental car.

379
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,401
Here we go.

380
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:35,006
- OK. Stop trying
to save me money, Eddie.

381
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,246
- Well, it is your money!

382
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,941
You ready for this?

383
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,242
- [Sighing]: Yeah.

384
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:21,486
Hi. We're here to see
Charlotte Porter.

385
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:23,121
- Oh. Please come in.

386
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,526
Miss Porter will
be down in a moment.

387
00:25:28,626 --> 00:25:30,461
Please make
yourselves comfortable.

388
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:31,629
- Thank you.

389
00:25:50,481 --> 00:25:51,583
- Hello.

390
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:55,486
Oh, Simon, um...

391
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:57,989
Please get my guests
whatever they'd like.

392
00:25:58,089 --> 00:25:59,924
- I'm fine, thanks.

393
00:26:00,024 --> 00:26:01,059
- Tea, please?

394
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:10,568
You, um... you have
a lovely home.

395
00:26:10,668 --> 00:26:12,237
- Thank you.

396
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:14,672
Sam and I were
very comfortable here.

397
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:21,279
[Chuckling]: I know
this is very awkward

398
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:23,047
for all of us, but...

399
00:26:23,147 --> 00:26:25,016
What can I do for you?

400
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:29,554
- Did, uh...
Sam choose the house?

401
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:32,090
- We both did. Why?

402
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:37,061
- Just, um...
it's not him.

403
00:26:37,161 --> 00:26:40,131
- Well, I can't imagine
why you would say that!

404
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:43,668
- Sorry, I don't
mean to be rude.

405
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:46,437
This just... wasn't his taste.

406
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:49,507
- Well, perhaps
with you it wasn't.

407
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:56,948
- So, um...

408
00:26:58,349 --> 00:27:00,285
How did you
and Sam meet?

409
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:02,320
- What difference
does it make now?

410
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:05,723
We...

411
00:27:05,823 --> 00:27:09,294
We met at a medical conference.

412
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:11,362
- Are you a doctor as well?

413
00:27:11,462 --> 00:27:13,731
- Oh God, no!

414
00:27:13,831 --> 00:27:17,302
One doctor in the house
is enough, and that was Sam.

415
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:21,506
- So he opened a practice
here in Detroit?

416
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:25,176
- No, no.
He preferred research.

417
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:26,544
He stopped
taking patients.

418
00:27:28,112 --> 00:27:29,247
- That's hard to believe.

419
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:30,682
Sam was so...

420
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:34,552
interested in his patients,
especially children.

421
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:36,521
It was very
important to him.

422
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:38,690
- Well, as I said,
he had no patients here.

423
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:42,360
- Man, this house
must be expensive!

424
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,462
- It is.

425
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:46,597
- So you were obviously
financially well-off

426
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:49,067
when you met Sam.

427
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,235
Is that correct?

428
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:54,105
- It's correct to say that's
none of your business, Mr. Fate.

429
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:55,506
- [Simon]: Excuse me.

430
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:07,285
- May I ask about
the funeral arrangements?

431
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:13,024
I... I never thought...

432
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:18,596
Sam was cremated last night.

433
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:21,399
It was a very private ceremony.

434
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:24,369
I'm so sorry.

435
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:30,141
- I'm sorry.
May I use your restroom?

436
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:33,544
- Yes, um... Simon will
show you where it is.

437
00:28:42,553 --> 00:28:45,490
- Do you know why
your husband went to Chicago?

438
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,458
- Well, he did
travel quite a bit.

439
00:28:47,558 --> 00:28:49,227
- So you know why he was there?

440
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:51,095
- No, Mr. Fate, I don't!

441
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:55,767
- Do you know he only
had a one-way ticket?

442
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:57,835
Do you know why
that might be, at all?

443
00:28:57,935 --> 00:29:00,171
- I... I don't know. Maybe...

444
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:03,274
Maybe he made a mistake when
he booked it. I don't know.

445
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:06,177
But it doesn't mean

446
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:07,712
what you might like it to mean.

447
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:10,181
- Oh! No...

448
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:14,085
- Sam and I were
very much in love!

449
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:15,586
It doesn't mean anything!

450
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:18,156
- No.

451
00:30:46,677 --> 00:30:48,779
Thank you very much
for your help.

452
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,881
- You're welcome.

453
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:52,383
Again, I'm really sorry.

454
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:55,186
Sam was a remarkable man.

455
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:58,289
I know that we'll both miss him.

456
00:31:01,792 --> 00:31:04,595
Oh, I hope I was
of some help to you.

457
00:31:04,695 --> 00:31:07,732
- Actually, um...
Sam had a half-sister, Denise.

458
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:10,368
who lived here in Detroit.
Did you ever meet her?

459
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:12,370
- No, Sam never
mentioned her.

460
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,872
As far as I know,
Sam was an only child.

461
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:18,209
- Well, thank you.

462
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:19,243
- You're welcome.

463
00:31:19,343 --> 00:31:20,244
Bye.

464
00:31:20,344 --> 00:31:21,345
- Bye.

465
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,356
- Sam would have never wanted
to live in a house like that.

466
00:31:32,456 --> 00:31:33,991
- What did you
find upstairs?

467
00:31:34,091 --> 00:31:36,227
- I found his bedroom.

468
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:37,695
If they were
so much in love,

469
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:39,630
why did they have
separate bedrooms?

470
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:41,666
- How'd you know
it was his bedroom?

471
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:44,302
- His belongings were
all over the place.

472
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,637
I even found an
unfinished crossword puzzle

473
00:31:46,737 --> 00:31:47,872
with his handwriting.

474
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:49,974
I know it was his room.

475
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,676
- So she was lying.

476
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:05,890
- Mind if I join you?

477
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,896
- No, no, not at all.

478
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:18,736
- Listen, I, um...

479
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:20,805
I wanted to thank you.

480
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:23,841
I don't think that
I could have done this alone.

481
00:32:23,941 --> 00:32:26,344
- Oh, no, no.
It's not necessary.

482
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:27,578
It's all part
of the service.

483
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,848
- Uh, can I have
a scotch, please?

484
00:32:30,948 --> 00:32:31,649
-
You got it.

485
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:36,387
- Um, I got
some information.

486
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:37,455
- OK.

487
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:38,823
- Charlotte Porter's house

488
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:40,658
is held by
a Michigan corporation.

489
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:42,927
BFA Medical Supplies, Inc.

490
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:44,996
- Thank you.
Uh, what's that mean?

491
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:46,797
- Maybe nothing, but...

492
00:32:46,897 --> 00:32:48,399
Whoever owns the corporation

493
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:49,634
bought the house.

494
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:50,735
- [Both]: With cash.

495
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:52,970
- Of course.
- Exactly.

496
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:55,840
- So, we check out
BFA Medical Supplies tomorrow.

497
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,342
- Yeah. Yeah, you bet.

498
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,012
- It's hard, you know.

499
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:03,781
I've already grieved the loss
of Sam. I have to do it again.

500
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,785
- Have you been with
anybody else since Sam?

501
00:33:10,921 --> 00:33:12,356
- No.

502
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:17,962
It's strange, sharing
such intimate details

503
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:19,430
with somebody
I hardly know.

504
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:25,469
But I'm glad it's
with you... Eddie.

505
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:28,806
- Yeah. So am I.

506
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:30,107
- Is that you, Jean?

507
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:34,045
- Chris!

508
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:35,379
It's been so long!

509
00:33:35,479 --> 00:33:37,048
- It is you!
How have you been?

510
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:37,915
- Oh, you know...

511
00:33:38,015 --> 00:33:40,051
- Aww.

512
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:42,119
- Well, all right!

513
00:33:42,219 --> 00:33:44,889
- Look at you!
You look fantastic!

514
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:46,357
- Oh, please.

515
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:48,559
You're always
one to flatter.

516
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:49,794
- Well, when it's true!

517
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:53,030
- Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm being rude.

518
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:54,765
Eddie, this is
Chris Schwartzman.

519
00:33:54,865 --> 00:33:55,733
Eddie Fate.
- Hey.

520
00:33:57,735 --> 00:33:59,070
- So how have you been?

521
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,706
- Uh... good!

522
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:04,575
But more importantly,
how are you, Jean?

523
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:05,843
- I'm fine.

524
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:07,011
- Just fine?

525
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:08,579
- Well, you know.

526
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,448
- Yeah. That was a tough one.

527
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:11,515
Losing Sam.

528
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:15,119
Yeah, I still
miss him, you know.

529
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,387
- Yeah.

530
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:17,521
Uh, Chris and Sam

531
00:34:17,621 --> 00:34:19,890
went to medical
school together.

532
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:20,991
- Is that right?

533
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:22,626
- Yeah.

534
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,929
- Well, he was the smarter
one, though. He got you!

535
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:26,097
- [Chuckling]:
Oh! Please.

536
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:27,765
- You know what, guys?

537
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:29,567
I'm gonna go to my room.

538
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:31,635
Get some shut-eye.

539
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:32,770
Nice to meet you, doctor.

540
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,038
- You too!

541
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:36,006
- I'll catch up with you.

542
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:37,007
- Yeah, definitely.

543
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,814
- Friend?

544
00:34:43,914 --> 00:34:46,517
- No, no, just
a business associate.

545
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:48,552
So what brings
you to Detroit?

546
00:34:48,652 --> 00:34:52,189
- Oh... one of those
boring medical conferences.

547
00:34:52,289 --> 00:34:53,657
- Oh.

548
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,527
- What about you, Jean?
Why are you in Detroit?

549
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:58,129
- Uh, I'm, uh...

550
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:01,799
looking into buying
some property in the area.

551
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:39,970
- "No credit history on record
and no accounts opened

552
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:43,174
"for Dr. Samuel Brooks
since May 1999."

553
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:46,510
- It was great
seeing you again, Chris.

554
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:48,245
- Oh... I've
missed you, Jean!

555
00:35:48,345 --> 00:35:50,648
Listen,
have lunch with me!

556
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:53,150
Now that we've reconnected,
I'd like to see you again!

557
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:55,119
- Uh, how about
we make it tomorrow?

558
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:56,754
- 1:00 in the lobby.

559
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:57,855
- Sounds great.

560
00:35:57,955 --> 00:35:59,056
- Good.

561
00:35:59,156 --> 00:36:00,658
- OK! See you tomorrow.

562
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:01,659
- All right.

563
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:15,806
- Excuse me.

564
00:36:17,741 --> 00:36:19,076
Eddie!

565
00:36:19,176 --> 00:36:21,979
- Oscar. You at
Blues Connection?

566
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,214
- And it's your round!

567
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:26,684
- Listen, listen.
You got a minute?

568
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:28,519
- Hell, I got all night. Shoot!

569
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:32,790
- Look. This woman's
husband, Sam Brooks?

570
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:35,926
It's like he disappeared
into thin air after 1999.

571
00:36:36,026 --> 00:36:37,228
- Yeah, so?

572
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:39,964
- So? No credit history,
no driver's license!

573
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:42,299
Not even a library card.

574
00:36:42,399 --> 00:36:45,102
- Well, he must have
wanted it that way!

575
00:36:45,202 --> 00:36:46,704
- Yeah, but why?

576
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:48,606
- There is no why
sometimes, Eddie.

577
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,841
People, they just
do crazy things!

578
00:36:50,941 --> 00:36:52,576
- No, I don't buy it.

579
00:36:52,676 --> 00:36:54,945
This guy has everything,
and he fakes his own death!

580
00:36:55,045 --> 00:36:56,614
-Whoo!

581
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,115
- So what are you saying?

582
00:36:58,215 --> 00:37:00,084
- I'm saying, maybe
he had some help!

583
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:02,720
Remember how you always say,
follow the money?

584
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,855
- I never thought you were
actually listening to me!

585
00:37:04,955 --> 00:37:06,056
I'm flattered!

586
00:37:06,156 --> 00:37:07,825
- Well, listen to this.

587
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:10,094
This Charlotte Porter.

588
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:13,230
She lives in a $3 1/2 million
home up in the Detroit hills.

589
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:16,667
- Well... that
explains it, my friend.

590
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:19,036
The good doctor's
moving on up.

591
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:20,771
-
No, no, no.

592
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:23,607
- Eddie. How many times
have I told you?

593
00:37:23,707 --> 00:37:25,709
Money changes people!

594
00:37:25,809 --> 00:37:28,812
- No, this guy didn't change.
He did a total about-face!

595
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,749
- You keep digging, eventually
you'll provoke someone,

596
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:33,884
and things'll start
to happen, all right?

597
00:37:33,984 --> 00:37:35,052
- All right, thanks.

598
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:36,320
-
All right, Eddie.

599
00:37:48,832 --> 00:37:50,668
- Oh, hey. What's up?

600
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:53,704
- I've been reading Sam's diary.
I wanted to show you something.

601
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:54,772
- Yeah, come in!

602
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:58,609
- I've read through it
a bunch of times,

603
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:01,145
I've just never put it
together until tonight.

604
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:05,149
Sam made a number of trips
from Chicago to Detroit

605
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:07,384
in the last 2 months
before he disappeared.

606
00:38:07,484 --> 00:38:10,087
Each time he came
back to Chicago,

607
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:12,289
he met with
someone named Castor.

608
00:38:12,389 --> 00:38:15,359
But if you look here,
the day before he went missing,

609
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,795
even though he made
the trip to Detroit,

610
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:20,264
it's the first time
Castor isn't mentioned.

611
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:22,099
I don't know
what it means,

612
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:23,901
but maybe
it's important?

613
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:25,703
- Does the name
Castor ring a bell?

614
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:26,937
- No.

615
00:38:27,037 --> 00:38:28,973
- Can I keep this overnight?

616
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:29,974
- Yeah, sure.

617
00:38:34,144 --> 00:38:35,412
OK.

618
00:38:41,251 --> 00:38:43,087
I'll, uh, see you
in the morning?

619
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:44,388
- Yeah, yeah.

620
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:47,658
- Good night.

621
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:48,425
- Good night.

622
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,670
So like you said,

623
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,238
the name Castor
keeps showing up

624
00:39:01,338 --> 00:39:02,773
in your husband's diary.

625
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:04,908
You think it could be
one of his patients?

626
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,877
- I don't know.

627
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:10,147
- What happens to patients
when a doctor dies?

628
00:39:10,247 --> 00:39:12,716
- The State Medical
Association decides.

629
00:39:12,816 --> 00:39:15,252
They assign the patients
to different physicians.

630
00:39:15,352 --> 00:39:17,888
Actually, I know
Chris Schwartzman got a few.

631
00:39:17,988 --> 00:39:19,289
He and Sam had
the same specialty.

632
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,457
- What was that?

633
00:39:20,557 --> 00:39:21,825
- Oncology.

634
00:39:21,925 --> 00:39:23,927
Sam specialized
in leukemia cases,

635
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,829
mainly paediatric.

636
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,301
- I don't know.

637
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:34,371
There's a missing link.
Some sort of connection.

638
00:39:34,471 --> 00:39:37,041
- You know, you're
very intuitive.

639
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:39,343
Why were you fired
off the police force?

640
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:43,447
- The higher-ups
didn't like my style.

641
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,149
I was a little too
out of the box.

642
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:47,251
- Ah. Too much of a maverick?

643
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:49,253
- I guess, something
like that, yeah.

644
00:39:50,854 --> 00:39:53,824
Look, I'm gonna fly back
to Chicago this morning.

645
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:56,060
I should be back tonight.

646
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,963
So just... do me a favour,
and stay close to the hotel.

647
00:40:00,964 --> 00:40:01,965
- OK!

648
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:05,469
- You know, in fact, just...

649
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,371
Stay in the hotel, all right?

650
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:10,974
- You're treating me like
I'm some kind of prisoner.

651
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,343
- No, I'm treating you
like you're a valued client.

652
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:46,977
- Directory assistance.
For what city?

653
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:48,178
- Detroit, Michigan.

654
00:40:48,278 --> 00:40:49,546
- For what name?

655
00:40:49,646 --> 00:40:52,082
- Could I have a listing
for Denise Brooks?

656
00:40:52,182 --> 00:40:53,851
-
Do you have an address?

657
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:56,286
- Uh... no, I'm sorry,
I don't have an address.

658
00:40:56,386 --> 00:40:59,056
- I'm sorry, I have
no listing for that name.

659
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:03,460
- Uh... would you be able
to go back as far as 1999?

660
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,130
- No, I'm sorry, ma'am, our
records don't go back that far.

661
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,198
- No. All right. Thank you.

662
00:41:09,399 --> 00:41:10,501
- Yes, sir. We handle

663
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:12,503
the referrals
of deceased physicians.

664
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:14,805
May I have the name
of the doctor, please?

665
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:18,909
- Yes. It's Dr. Samuel Brooks.
He passed away April 1999.

666
00:41:21,311 --> 00:41:23,580
- It would look
like Dr. Brooks' patients

667
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,016
were referred
to several doctors.

668
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:28,285
Is there a particular patient
you're interested in?

669
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:31,088
- Yes, Castor? I don't
have a first initial.

670
00:41:34,491 --> 00:41:36,560
- I have a Ricky Castor.

671
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:40,264
His file was referred
to... Dr. C. Schwartzman.

672
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:42,166
East 31st Street, Chicago.

673
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:43,467
- Thank you very much.

674
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:44,968
-
Happy to be of help.

675
00:41:45,068 --> 00:41:46,003
- All right.

676
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:56,313
- All right, let's try
phone listings for 1999.

677
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:04,221
Denise Brooks, 44 Mill Street.

678
00:42:24,408 --> 00:42:25,309
- Hi.

679
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:26,410
- Hello.

680
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,078
- Uh, is Dr. Schwartzman in?

681
00:42:28,178 --> 00:42:30,247
- No, sir. I'm afraid
he's out of town.

682
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:31,648
Did you have an appointment?

683
00:42:31,748 --> 00:42:34,184
- No, I didn't, but
it's quite urgent I see him.

684
00:42:34,284 --> 00:42:35,552
Is there anybody
else I can see?

685
00:42:35,652 --> 00:42:37,187
- Is it a medical matter?

686
00:42:37,287 --> 00:42:39,223
- This is a doctor's
office, isn't it?

687
00:42:40,557 --> 00:42:42,226
- Could I have
your name, please?

688
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:44,595
- It's, uh, Smith. Alvin Smith.

689
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:46,930
- I'll check.
Can you wait a minute?

690
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,131
- Yeah. I can wait!

691
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:15,626
- Can you wait a minute?

692
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:16,660
- Sure.

693
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:28,405
- This can't be right.

694
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:32,709
Are you sure
this is 44 Mill Street?

695
00:43:32,809 --> 00:43:34,645
- This is definitely 44.

696
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:38,382
- I'm gonna make a quick call.

697
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:57,134
Hi, yes. I was calling about
your listing at 44 Mill Street?

698
00:43:57,234 --> 00:43:58,969
-
Yes, I'm the agent.
May I help you?

699
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:01,305
- Yeah. Do you know what
happened to the house?

700
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:03,073
-
May I ask
why you're inquiring?

701
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:05,242
- I might be interested
in making an offer.

702
00:44:05,342 --> 00:44:06,977
Was the house torn down?

703
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:08,612
-
Uh, no. I believe
there was a fire.

704
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:09,980
- A fire?

705
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,315
Do you know when that was?

706
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:12,482
-
I'm not really sure.

707
00:44:12,582 --> 00:44:14,251
- OK, I'll call back
if I'm interested.

708
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:15,552
-
Certainly, call anytime.

709
00:44:15,652 --> 00:44:16,520
- Thank you.

710
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:21,425
-
Kama Sutra Club.

711
00:44:21,525 --> 00:44:23,260
- Hey, is there
an Emilio Castor there?

712
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:26,163
-
We don't give out that kind
of information over the phone.

713
00:44:26,263 --> 00:44:27,564
- It's important!

714
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:29,633
-
We don't give that
information over the phone!

715
00:44:30,133 --> 00:44:31,001
- Could you just--

716
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:06,770
- Hi, honey.
What can I get you?

717
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,438
- Uh... an espresso.

718
00:45:08,538 --> 00:45:10,374
- Does this look
like a coffee shop?

719
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:13,243
- OK, I'll take
a scotch then, please.

720
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,611
- All right.

721
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:15,712
- Keep the change.

722
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:19,082
Hey!
- Mm-hmm?

723
00:45:19,182 --> 00:45:21,284
- Is there a guy named
Emilio Castor who works here?

724
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:22,652
- Yeah, he's
the day janitor.

725
00:45:22,753 --> 00:45:23,653
- Is he here now?

726
00:45:23,754 --> 00:45:25,122
- Why do you
wanna see him?

727
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,123
- Personal business.

728
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,691
- You his loan shark?

729
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:30,060
- No. No, actually,
I owe him money.

730
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,795
- I'll see if he's busy.

731
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:32,796
- Thank you.

732
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,406
No. No thank you.

733
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:49,079
- He's coming.

734
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:50,113
- Thanks.

735
00:45:59,156 --> 00:46:00,657
- You owe me money?

736
00:46:00,757 --> 00:46:03,160
- Is there anywhere
we can go talk?

737
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,127
It's important.

738
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,464
- Guess I take
my break now.

739
00:46:19,209 --> 00:46:21,311
So, what are
you, a cop?

740
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:23,313
- No. No,
sir, I'm not.

741
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:24,815
I'm with the
State Medical Association.

742
00:46:24,915 --> 00:46:26,416
- You got papers?

743
00:46:26,516 --> 00:46:27,417
- Yeah.

744
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:31,254
Only this kind.

745
00:46:38,628 --> 00:46:40,630
- I got a couple
questions to ask

746
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:41,898
about your son,
if that's OK.

747
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:45,869
- He's gone.
My boy's gone.

748
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:47,604
- What do you mean?

749
00:46:47,704 --> 00:46:49,706
He passed away?

750
00:46:49,806 --> 00:46:52,309
- I didn't have the money
to continue his treatment.

751
00:46:55,745 --> 00:46:57,714
- Do you remember what
doctors you took him to?

752
00:46:57,814 --> 00:46:59,816
Was one of them
Dr. Samuel Brooks?

753
00:46:59,916 --> 00:47:01,585
- Yeah, but he disappeared!

754
00:47:01,685 --> 00:47:04,888
He was a good doctor.
He looked after my boy.

755
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:07,324
- Who paid for the treatment?
Was it Dr. Brooks?

756
00:47:08,692 --> 00:47:10,594
- And when he...
when he went away,

757
00:47:10,694 --> 00:47:12,429
Dr. Schwartzman
wouldn't do any treatment

758
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:13,663
without money. Big money.

759
00:47:13,763 --> 00:47:15,298
Which I didn't have.

760
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:19,202
Know how that makes me feel?

761
00:47:19,302 --> 00:47:21,404
I don't need your charity.

762
00:47:25,408 --> 00:47:26,810
I wanna show you something.

763
00:47:29,446 --> 00:47:31,448
That's my Ricky.

764
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:38,255
- I'm-- I'm truly
very sorry, Mr. Castor.

765
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:46,429
Thank you.

766
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:05,415
- Sorry, excuse me.
Chris! I'm so sorry I'm late.

767
00:48:05,515 --> 00:48:07,817
- I was starting to think
you forgot about our lunch!

768
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:10,320
- Of course not. Just wait
a few more minutes.

769
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:11,488
I wanna freshen
up a bit.

770
00:48:11,588 --> 00:48:12,889
- Of course!
- Be right back!

771
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:28,338
- [Scoffing]: Long lunch!

772
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:31,808
- You're early
for last call!

773
00:48:31,908 --> 00:48:33,376
- Could I get
one more, please?

774
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:39,783
- So you being back
here in Chicago

775
00:48:39,883 --> 00:48:42,419
must mean that this
great mystery's been solved.

776
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:43,954
- Yeah, I wish it was.

777
00:48:44,054 --> 00:48:45,889
It's just getting
more complicated.

778
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:46,756
- How so?

779
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:50,594
- Ever see one of those
puzzles with the dots?

780
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:53,029
You look at the picture one
way, and you see one thing,

781
00:48:53,129 --> 00:48:54,931
look at the same
picture another way,

782
00:48:55,031 --> 00:48:56,933
and it looks
completely different?

783
00:48:57,033 --> 00:48:58,768
- Yup. Just about
every morning.

784
00:48:58,868 --> 00:49:00,770
- [Chuckling]: Yeah.

785
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:02,639
Look, I got
a question for you.

786
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:07,277
When you found Brooks
down by the water,

787
00:49:07,377 --> 00:49:09,779
you did consider that he
might not have died naturally.

788
00:49:09,879 --> 00:49:11,615
- Oh, of course!

789
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:14,384
But there was no evidence
to suggest a homicide,

790
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:16,052
so we ruled it
natural causes.

791
00:49:16,152 --> 00:49:18,622
You know, people die of
heart attacks every day.

792
00:49:18,722 --> 00:49:21,658
- Yeah. A guy doesn't talk,
or communicate with his wife,

793
00:49:21,758 --> 00:49:23,827
for 5 years, then
one day shows up,

794
00:49:23,927 --> 00:49:26,663
drives down to the waterfront,
and has a heart attack.

795
00:49:26,763 --> 00:49:27,731
I don't buy it.

796
00:49:27,831 --> 00:49:29,065
- Come on.
Listen to me.

797
00:49:29,165 --> 00:49:31,368
You know how this works.
You've been there!

798
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:33,003
You can't spend a week
on a dead-end case!

799
00:49:35,105 --> 00:49:37,440
- There's something
about this.

800
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:39,976
Just doesn't
sit well with me.

801
00:49:40,076 --> 00:49:42,512
So he was
perfectly healthy,

802
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:44,481
other than his heart,
when you found him?

803
00:49:45,815 --> 00:49:47,917
- He had a nosebleed.

804
00:49:48,018 --> 00:49:50,320
- And I suppose
there was no blood test.

805
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,055
- Nope! I didn't
see a need!

806
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:53,590
- That's great, Oscar.

807
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:55,592
I get fired off the force

808
00:49:55,692 --> 00:49:57,694
for bending some
stupid-ass off-duty rule,

809
00:49:57,794 --> 00:50:00,563
and you won't lift
a finger to investigate?

810
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,332
- There was nothing
to investigate!

811
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:03,833
And don't use
that tone with me!

812
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,470
Listen to me, Eddie.

813
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:09,973
That guy didn't die because
someone punched him in the nose.

814
00:50:11,908 --> 00:50:13,109
- The rental car.

815
00:50:13,209 --> 00:50:15,078
Where'd it come from?

816
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:17,113
- I'll get the
records to you.

817
00:50:17,213 --> 00:50:19,716
- All right. Do me
a favour, OK?

818
00:50:19,816 --> 00:50:22,452
If there's still blood
in the car, have it tested.

819
00:50:22,552 --> 00:50:23,753
- All right.

820
00:50:23,853 --> 00:50:25,055
- All right.

821
00:50:26,556 --> 00:50:27,557
Thanks for the beer.

822
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:31,995
- Put it on his tab.

823
00:50:33,897 --> 00:50:37,467
- So, you can see why
I'm having trouble letting go.

824
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:42,138
- I can't believe
what you just told me!

825
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:46,910
- Sam disappears from
my life for 5 years,

826
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:48,478
and then he
shows up dead.

827
00:50:58,521 --> 00:51:00,557
- So you're not here
to buy real estate, are you?

828
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:03,893
- No.

829
00:51:03,993 --> 00:51:05,628
- Looking for answers.

830
00:51:06,863 --> 00:51:07,864
OK.

831
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:11,000
What have you found?

832
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:15,538
- Well, apparently Sam remarried

833
00:51:15,638 --> 00:51:17,140
to a woman named
Charlotte Porter.

834
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:20,877
They lived up in the hills

835
00:51:20,977 --> 00:51:22,412
in this huge house.

836
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:26,916
I can't imagine
Sam living like that.

837
00:51:27,016 --> 00:51:29,185
- People do change.

838
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:33,623
- You know Sam never
cared about material things.

839
00:51:33,723 --> 00:51:35,425
He hated anything
ostentatious.

840
00:51:41,064 --> 00:51:43,967
Chris, you knew Sam.

841
00:51:46,035 --> 00:51:48,738
Do you believe that he would
have left me for another woman?

842
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:55,178
- If you talk to a few
of my psychiatrist friends,

843
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:57,680
they'll tell you
we all lead

844
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:59,816
different lives
at different times.

845
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:02,519
Sometimes at
the same time.

846
00:52:11,694 --> 00:52:14,230
- Well, I guess I'm just
one of those simple people.

847
00:52:21,971 --> 00:52:24,641
Did you ever meet
his sister Denise?

848
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:27,210
- Wait. No!

849
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,978
I never knew
he had one!

850
00:52:29,078 --> 00:52:32,949
- Yeah, he, uh... always
sent her a birthday card.

851
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:36,820
I've tried finding her
house here in Detroit,

852
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,489
but there was a fire
a number of years ago.

853
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:41,257
I can't find out
what happened to her.

854
00:52:41,357 --> 00:52:43,893
- OK. Why do you
think that matters?

855
00:52:43,993 --> 00:52:46,830
- Uh, if I could find her,
maybe she could help?

856
00:52:49,032 --> 00:52:50,033
- Wait.

857
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:56,873
I really wish I could
help you more, Jean.

858
00:52:56,973 --> 00:52:59,108
But I think...

859
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,979
You may be
making things worse.

860
00:53:04,814 --> 00:53:07,083
I mean, you can't deny
the reality here!

861
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:09,819
Sam had another life!

862
00:53:09,919 --> 00:53:12,088
I guess.

863
00:53:16,392 --> 00:53:18,261
Ah, we should
get going. Come on.

864
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:39,716
- Hey, you're back!

865
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:40,917
- Hey!

866
00:53:41,017 --> 00:53:42,719
How's everything?

867
00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:44,821
- Feel like I'm on
an emotional roller-coaster.

868
00:53:44,921 --> 00:53:46,122
How was Chicago?

869
00:53:46,222 --> 00:53:47,590
- It's too early to tell.

870
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:49,959
Can I... can I talk
to you for a second?

871
00:53:50,059 --> 00:53:51,094
- Yeah!

872
00:53:57,133 --> 00:53:59,135
- All right. I gotta
ask you something.

873
00:53:59,235 --> 00:54:00,270
- OK.

874
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:03,006
- I want you to go back

875
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:05,341
to the day before
your husband went missing.

876
00:54:05,441 --> 00:54:07,176
What was
his mood like?

877
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:13,116
It seemed fine.

878
00:54:13,216 --> 00:54:15,652
He said he was
gonna have a busy day.

879
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,020
He'd be home late.

880
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,855
- Was he upset
about anything?

881
00:54:18,955 --> 00:54:21,925
- No. Actually, he was more
quiet than usual that day.

882
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:24,861
- And when he returned?

883
00:54:26,696 --> 00:54:28,665
- He was just
tired. Uh...

884
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:31,167
He had a couple drinks
before going to bed,

885
00:54:31,267 --> 00:54:32,335
which was
unusual for him.

886
00:54:34,971 --> 00:54:38,041
There was something
that night. Um...

887
00:54:39,242 --> 00:54:41,678
He got out of bed.
I had heard loud voices,

888
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:43,913
but I couldn't make out
what they were saying.

889
00:54:44,013 --> 00:54:45,815
- Did you recognize
who it was?

890
00:54:45,915 --> 00:54:47,050
- No.

891
00:54:48,084 --> 00:54:48,952
By the time I got out
of bed, he was coming back.

892
00:54:49,052 --> 00:54:51,654
He said one of the
neighbours was complaining

893
00:54:51,754 --> 00:54:54,023
that he had blocked
their car in the driveway.

894
00:54:54,123 --> 00:54:55,158
- And you believed him?

895
00:54:55,258 --> 00:54:57,727
- Yeah, we had
difficult neighbours.

896
00:54:57,827 --> 00:55:00,063
- OK, now
the next day.

897
00:55:00,163 --> 00:55:01,197
The day he
disappeared.

898
00:55:05,234 --> 00:55:07,971
- It was a Wednesday.
His day off.

899
00:55:15,311 --> 00:55:17,080
How's your
crossword puzzle?

900
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:17,914
- It's all right.

901
00:55:20,783 --> 00:55:22,118
- You all right?

902
00:55:22,218 --> 00:55:24,020
- Sure. Yeah, I'm fine.

903
00:55:25,388 --> 00:55:26,923
- You seem kind of distant.

904
00:55:28,157 --> 00:55:29,759
- I'm as good as gold.

905
00:55:32,762 --> 00:55:34,397
- So, you're going down
to the boat today?

906
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:35,765
- Yeah.

907
00:55:35,865 --> 00:55:36,766
- Want me to come?

908
00:55:36,866 --> 00:55:38,701
I can cancel lunch with Mom.

909
00:55:38,801 --> 00:55:40,203
- No, that's OK. There are...

910
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:42,105
...a few things I need
to do on the boat

911
00:55:42,205 --> 00:55:43,373
before the season opens.

912
00:55:58,388 --> 00:56:00,089
- What is it, Sam?

913
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:04,260
- Nothing.

914
00:56:09,332 --> 00:56:11,300
I love you very much.

915
00:56:11,401 --> 00:56:13,169
[Echoing]: Very much.

916
00:56:16,472 --> 00:56:17,473
- I love you too.

917
00:56:27,984 --> 00:56:30,286
It was like he knew he was
never gonna see me again.

918
00:56:43,032 --> 00:56:45,334
It was the last
time he held me.

919
00:56:48,271 --> 00:56:50,840
They found our boat
out on the lake.

920
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:53,009
Sam was missing.

921
00:56:55,244 --> 00:56:56,512
- You know, Jean...

922
00:56:59,348 --> 00:57:01,951
I don't think your husband
died of a heart attack.

923
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,189
I think someone
may have killed him.

924
00:57:10,893 --> 00:57:12,195
- Who?

925
00:57:13,262 --> 00:57:14,330
I... the Sam I knew

926
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:16,933
was very well-liked,
very well-respected.

927
00:57:17,033 --> 00:57:19,936
He was on the verge of
a new cancer treatment therapy.

928
00:57:20,036 --> 00:57:20,970
- How new?

929
00:57:22,004 --> 00:57:23,539
- Cutting-edge.

930
00:57:23,639 --> 00:57:26,209
It was a drug protocol
never used in the US before.

931
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:29,312
- Well...

932
00:57:29,412 --> 00:57:31,914
That might have
been a great reason

933
00:57:32,014 --> 00:57:33,916
someone wanted
to kill your husband!

934
00:57:34,016 --> 00:57:36,119
- People have killed
for a lot less.

935
00:57:38,888 --> 00:57:40,523
Yup! Just got it.

936
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:42,792
Thank you so much,
Paul. I owe you one.

937
00:57:42,892 --> 00:57:44,293
All right. Take care.

938
00:57:45,928 --> 00:57:47,296
- Who is he, exactly?

939
00:57:47,396 --> 00:57:49,298
- He's an ex-
colleague of mine.

940
00:57:49,398 --> 00:57:51,934
He's a journalist
here in Detroit now.

941
00:57:52,034 --> 00:57:53,436
Here it is.

942
00:58:01,277 --> 00:58:02,845
- Denise died in the fire.

943
00:58:02,945 --> 00:58:05,047
- Explains why
we can't find her.

944
00:58:12,622 --> 00:58:14,824
- May of 1999.

945
00:58:20,196 --> 00:58:21,430
I'm sorry.

946
00:58:28,237 --> 00:58:31,207
- That was just
one month after Sam died.

947
00:58:31,307 --> 00:58:32,575
- What a coincidence.

948
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:34,277
- Yeah.

949
00:58:34,377 --> 00:58:36,078
So...

950
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:38,080
Where do we go from here?

951
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,543
Maybe you should go
back to your room now.

952
00:59:09,178 --> 00:59:10,379
- Do you want me to leave?

953
00:59:17,587 --> 00:59:18,654
- No.

954
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:48,044
- Come back to bed!

955
01:00:51,213 --> 01:00:54,083
- No, I'm starving.
I wanna go down for breakfast.

956
01:01:17,773 --> 01:01:19,442
- Hey!

957
01:01:19,542 --> 01:01:20,476
You're still here?

958
01:01:20,576 --> 01:01:22,044
- Chris!

959
01:01:23,446 --> 01:01:25,481
- So, uh... how's
everything going, Jean?

960
01:01:25,581 --> 01:01:27,083
- Oh, it's fine.

961
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:28,184
- Good. I'm glad!

962
01:01:28,284 --> 01:01:31,120
- I thought your conference
was over yesterday!

963
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:33,089
- Just some...
some last-minute details.

964
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:35,224
Listen, if you're both
free for dinner tonight,

965
01:01:35,324 --> 01:01:36,559
would you be my guests?

966
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:39,095
- I'm sorry, we've
got another engagement.

967
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:40,296
Thanks anyway, Doc.

968
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:44,567
- Sure. No problem.

969
01:01:44,667 --> 01:01:45,601
OK, I'll see you later!

970
01:01:45,701 --> 01:01:47,036
- OK.

971
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:50,639
You really shouldn't
be so hard on him.

972
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:52,441
- No. Was I?

973
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:55,544
- He's a good doctor,

974
01:01:55,644 --> 01:01:57,813
and he's always been
a very good friend!

975
01:01:57,913 --> 01:01:59,382
- Well, I don't
like your friend.

976
01:01:59,482 --> 01:02:00,483
- You jealous?

977
01:02:00,583 --> 01:02:01,817
- Have I reason to be?

978
01:02:01,917 --> 01:02:04,253
- No, of course not.
It was a long time ago!

979
01:02:04,353 --> 01:02:05,788
- You've known him
for a while, huh?

980
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:08,457
- Yeah, he introduced
Sam and I at a party.

981
01:02:08,557 --> 01:02:11,594
- Well, he's got slightly
different priorities than Sam.

982
01:02:11,694 --> 01:02:12,595
- Meaning?

983
01:02:15,531 --> 01:02:17,566
- I found out in Chicago

984
01:02:17,666 --> 01:02:19,835
that Ricky Castor was
one of Sam's patients.

985
01:02:19,935 --> 01:02:22,304
He had a rare form
of leukemia called ALL.

986
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:23,572
It's terminal.

987
01:02:23,672 --> 01:02:25,574
- Sam tried so hard
to help kids.

988
01:02:25,674 --> 01:02:27,843
- He did more than try.
He was paying

989
01:02:27,943 --> 01:02:30,079
for Ricky's
expensive drug treatment

990
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:31,247
out of his own pocket!

991
01:02:31,347 --> 01:02:33,449
When Sam went missing,

992
01:02:33,549 --> 01:02:36,152
the boy was referred
to your friend.

993
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:37,753
He wasn't as generous.

994
01:02:37,853 --> 01:02:41,490
The father couldn't afford
the drugs, and the boy died.

995
01:02:41,590 --> 01:02:42,758
He was 10.

996
01:02:57,606 --> 01:02:59,408
That's interesting.

997
01:02:59,508 --> 01:03:02,545
Charlotte Porter's house is
owned by BFA Medical Supplies,

998
01:03:02,645 --> 01:03:05,181
but it's headquartered
in the Cayman Islands.

999
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:06,482
- The corporate veil.

1000
01:03:06,582 --> 01:03:09,452
When they wanna disguise
who owns the company.

1001
01:03:09,552 --> 01:03:11,353
- You mean she's
hiding something.

1002
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:14,490
- I still don't understand Sam's
involvement in all of this.

1003
01:03:16,725 --> 01:03:18,327
So what does
that leave us?

1004
01:03:18,427 --> 01:03:19,428
- An address.

1005
01:03:23,566 --> 01:03:25,334
And here it is.

1006
01:03:25,434 --> 01:03:27,870
The local office in Detroit.

1007
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:29,505
Let's go around back.

1008
01:03:52,461 --> 01:03:54,630
So it's on
the second floor.

1009
01:04:17,887 --> 01:04:19,288
- Here it is.

1010
01:04:39,508 --> 01:04:40,442
- There we go!

1011
01:04:46,282 --> 01:04:47,383
Yeah, it's OK.

1012
01:05:12,708 --> 01:05:14,276
- Syringes, gauze...

1013
01:05:14,376 --> 01:05:16,478
It's all
medical supplies.

1014
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:17,746
- Yeah.

1015
01:05:20,482 --> 01:05:22,351
I'm gonna take
a look in the back.

1016
01:05:23,686 --> 01:05:24,486
- OK.

1017
01:05:45,074 --> 01:05:46,542
- It's all from Mexico!

1018
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:17,439
- Doesn't seem to be
any paperwork.

1019
01:06:39,728 --> 01:06:40,729
Eddie?

1020
01:06:49,738 --> 01:06:51,607
- Dammit! Let's go, Jean!

1021
01:06:51,707 --> 01:06:52,741
- What's wrong?

1022
01:06:52,841 --> 01:06:54,410
- There's a camera there.

1023
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:55,444
Let's go, come on!

1024
01:07:45,994 --> 01:07:46,995
You OK?

1025
01:07:49,598 --> 01:07:50,766
- Look, Eddie.

1026
01:07:50,866 --> 01:07:52,801
There's liquid
inside these bubbles.

1027
01:07:54,536 --> 01:07:56,472
- We're gonna
get this tested.

1028
01:08:01,477 --> 01:08:02,444
-Eddie!

1029
01:08:02,544 --> 01:08:04,046
- Oscar! Yeah, hey, it's Eddie.

1030
01:08:04,146 --> 01:08:06,749
Look, I need you
to do me a favour, all right?

1031
01:08:06,849 --> 01:08:09,051
I need you to find me a lab
here in Detroit ASAP.

1032
01:08:09,151 --> 01:08:10,085
-Right.

1033
01:08:10,185 --> 01:08:11,987
- Call me when you find it?

1034
01:08:12,087 --> 01:08:13,021
- Yes.
- OK.

1035
01:08:13,122 --> 01:08:15,457
- I came to Detroit

1036
01:08:15,557 --> 01:08:17,559
to find out the truth
behind Sam's choices,

1037
01:08:17,659 --> 01:08:19,728
but clearly, we're involved
in something illegal.

1038
01:08:19,828 --> 01:08:21,029
What are we getting into?

1039
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:23,031
- We're close
to the truth, Jean.

1040
01:08:24,633 --> 01:08:26,535
- I don't know if
I wanna know the truth.

1041
01:08:41,116 --> 01:08:42,484
- Hold on.

1042
01:08:42,584 --> 01:08:44,153
Just keep it, OK?
Hold on!

1043
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:47,689
- Eddie, I'm
pulling the plug.

1044
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:50,225
Sam's dead, there's
nothing I can do about it.

1045
01:08:50,325 --> 01:08:52,060
I just wanna go
back to Chicago.

1046
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:54,530
- Please, wait. Look,
just give me a few hours.

1047
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:56,165
Let me go
to the lab, and we'll...

1048
01:08:56,265 --> 01:08:57,900
we'll talk
when I get back.

1049
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,601
Call me if you
need to, all right?

1050
01:09:02,271 --> 01:09:03,539
Jean, look at me.

1051
01:09:05,908 --> 01:09:08,610
Everything is gonna
be just fine, OK?

1052
01:09:08,710 --> 01:09:10,479
Trust me.

1053
01:09:10,579 --> 01:09:12,681
I'm sticking with you
till this is over.

1054
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:15,717
- OK.

1055
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:16,552
- OK.

1056
01:09:20,722 --> 01:09:21,890
OK.

1057
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,034
- Mrs. Brooks?

1058
01:09:32,134 --> 01:09:33,235
- Yeah?

1059
01:09:35,604 --> 01:09:37,606
- This fax came in
marked "urgent,"

1060
01:09:37,706 --> 01:09:39,274
for either you
or Mr. Fate.

1061
01:09:39,374 --> 01:09:40,209
- Thank you.

1062
01:09:51,887 --> 01:09:53,722
"Subject's coronary arrest

1063
01:09:53,822 --> 01:09:56,825
"brought on by extremely
high levels of drug Arzac,

1064
01:09:56,925 --> 01:09:59,261
"an ephedrine derivative
for treatment of leukemia."

1065
01:10:18,247 --> 01:10:20,816
- Where in the world
did you find this?

1066
01:10:20,916 --> 01:10:22,551
- What is it?

1067
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:36,265
- Hello?

1068
01:10:36,365 --> 01:10:38,600
-Jean, first and final warning.

1069
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:41,069
Leave Detroit now,
or you will both get hurt.

1070
01:10:41,169 --> 01:10:42,271
- Who is this?

1071
01:10:58,053 --> 01:10:59,154
- Hello?

1072
01:10:59,254 --> 01:11:00,722
- Eddie, come back to the hotel.

1073
01:11:00,822 --> 01:11:04,026
- Jean, you OK? What's wrong?

1074
01:11:04,126 --> 01:11:05,227
- Please come. I'm scared.

1075
01:11:05,327 --> 01:11:06,828
I got a threatening phone call.

1076
01:11:08,163 --> 01:11:10,365
- Stay in your room.
I'll be right there!

1077
01:11:18,073 --> 01:11:19,641
Jean, it's Eddie! Open up!

1078
01:11:20,876 --> 01:11:22,010
What happened?

1079
01:11:22,110 --> 01:11:23,879
- I got a call.
- What'd they say?

1080
01:11:23,979 --> 01:11:25,213
- They were very clear.

1081
01:11:25,314 --> 01:11:27,049
They said to get out
of Detroit or else.

1082
01:11:27,149 --> 01:11:28,951
Look, we got the
fax from Ortuso.

1083
01:11:29,051 --> 01:11:30,752
Sam died of an overdose.

1084
01:11:30,852 --> 01:11:32,721
He was injected
with a drug called Arzac.

1085
01:11:32,821 --> 01:11:34,323
- Arzac? Is that
what you said?

1086
01:11:34,423 --> 01:11:36,224
- Yeah, it's right there
on the blood test.

1087
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:40,062
- The liquid in the bubbles
we found was Arzac.

1088
01:11:40,162 --> 01:11:41,897
The woman at
the lab said

1089
01:11:41,997 --> 01:11:44,333
it's extremely rare
and illegal here in the States.

1090
01:11:47,936 --> 01:11:50,038
- They killed him.

1091
01:11:54,443 --> 01:11:56,044
- You know,
I think it's time

1092
01:11:56,144 --> 01:11:58,313
I pay Charlotte Porter
another visit.

1093
01:11:58,413 --> 01:12:00,082
- No. We have to
go to the police.

1094
01:12:00,182 --> 01:12:02,217
- We will, but
we need more proof first.

1095
01:12:04,219 --> 01:12:06,188
- Then I'm
coming with you.

1096
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:09,691
- OK.

1097
01:12:09,791 --> 01:12:11,226
All right.

1098
01:12:19,334 --> 01:12:20,335
Jean, wait!

1099
01:12:23,872 --> 01:12:24,906
You stay in the car.

1100
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:26,808
- No, I'm
coming with you!

1101
01:12:26,908 --> 01:12:28,176
- It's safer.
- Then you stay!

1102
01:12:31,213 --> 01:12:32,381
- All right.

1103
01:12:47,396 --> 01:12:49,164
[Whispering]:
There's someone there!

1104
01:12:59,174 --> 01:13:01,276
I told you
I don't like that guy.

1105
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:05,347
Wait. Jean! Jean, wait!

1106
01:13:22,931 --> 01:13:23,932
Come on!

1107
01:13:26,234 --> 01:13:29,037
- Weren't you supposed to keep
an eye on her at the hotel?

1108
01:13:29,137 --> 01:13:31,506
- I did. I told her
to forget about Sam

1109
01:13:31,606 --> 01:13:33,341
and go back
to Chicago.

1110
01:13:33,442 --> 01:13:35,977
- Then why are they sneaking
around the property?

1111
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:37,813
- Guess I wasn't
persuasive enough.

1112
01:13:39,047 --> 01:13:40,382
Anyway...

1113
01:13:40,482 --> 01:13:42,417
This puts an
end to it all.

1114
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:55,030
- Hold on, hold on.

1115
01:13:55,130 --> 01:13:56,364
- Don't move!

1116
01:13:56,465 --> 01:13:57,766
- [Eddie]: Stay back, Jean!

1117
01:13:59,568 --> 01:14:01,036
Who are you?

1118
01:14:01,136 --> 01:14:01,937
What do you want?

1119
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:04,306
Unh!

1120
01:14:19,087 --> 01:14:20,522
- Well, well.

1121
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:23,024
Seems our hero is coming to!

1122
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:25,260
- Jean.

1123
01:14:26,495 --> 01:14:27,963
Where's Jean?

1124
01:14:28,063 --> 01:14:29,798
- Don't worry
about our merry widow.

1125
01:14:29,898 --> 01:14:31,099
We've got business to discuss.

1126
01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:33,101
- What do you want?

1127
01:14:33,201 --> 01:14:36,004
How come I'm not
already in a body bag?

1128
01:14:36,104 --> 01:14:38,473
- I wanna be sure I'm not
trading one problem for another.

1129
01:14:38,573 --> 01:14:40,575
I'm a businessman, Mr. Fate.

1130
01:14:40,675 --> 01:14:42,244
- I thought you were a doctor.

1131
01:14:45,947 --> 01:14:47,916
- You really don't know
when to shut up, do you?

1132
01:14:56,091 --> 01:14:57,425
And that big mouth of yours

1133
01:14:57,526 --> 01:14:59,327
is exactly what
I'm concerned about.

1134
01:15:01,062 --> 01:15:03,832
You see, I don't wanna
get rid of you,

1135
01:15:03,932 --> 01:15:07,602
and have your buddy Ortuso
breathing down my neck tomorrow.

1136
01:15:07,702 --> 01:15:09,237
How much does he know?

1137
01:15:09,337 --> 01:15:11,473
- You're gonna kill me anyway.

1138
01:15:15,343 --> 01:15:16,311
- Maybe so!

1139
01:15:19,281 --> 01:15:22,484
But our good friend Mrs. Brooks

1140
01:15:22,584 --> 01:15:25,987
is currently getting better
acquainted with Charlotte.

1141
01:15:26,087 --> 01:15:26,988
See?

1142
01:15:28,657 --> 01:15:31,626
All I have to do is
press this little button here,

1143
01:15:31,726 --> 01:15:35,130
and Jean will experience
the wonders of Arzac.

1144
01:15:36,698 --> 01:15:39,000
- You're bluffing!

1145
01:15:48,109 --> 01:15:49,311
- Maybe.

1146
01:15:49,411 --> 01:15:52,214
But do you wanna take that risk?

1147
01:15:52,314 --> 01:15:53,415
The choice is yours!

1148
01:15:55,350 --> 01:15:57,352
See, if you cooperate,

1149
01:15:57,452 --> 01:16:00,155
we'll only need one body bag.

1150
01:16:00,255 --> 01:16:02,190
If you don't...

1151
01:16:02,290 --> 01:16:03,425
we're gonna need two.

1152
01:16:03,525 --> 01:16:05,126
- I'M GONNA KILL YOU!

1153
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:06,261
COME HERE!

1154
01:16:50,705 --> 01:16:52,374
- Don't move!

1155
01:17:02,417 --> 01:17:05,253
- I think we can come to
an understanding here, Mr. Fate.

1156
01:17:07,155 --> 01:17:08,123
- You disgust me.

1157
01:17:10,258 --> 01:17:12,327
How can you cash in
on other people's misery?

1158
01:17:12,427 --> 01:17:13,662
How do you sleep at night?

1159
01:17:15,196 --> 01:17:17,432
- When patients
dying of cancer

1160
01:17:17,532 --> 01:17:20,068
are willing to pay
the high price for a drug

1161
01:17:20,168 --> 01:17:22,537
that I know can
save their lives,

1162
01:17:22,637 --> 01:17:25,373
why should I give up
the opportunity for a profit?

1163
01:17:25,473 --> 01:17:26,608
- Because it's illegal.

1164
01:17:26,708 --> 01:17:27,575
- Illegal?

1165
01:17:29,177 --> 01:17:31,379
So you mean to tell me
that in your work,

1166
01:17:31,479 --> 01:17:34,215
you never bend the rules
a little for the greater good?

1167
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:36,418
- I've never killed
anyone for money!

1168
01:17:36,518 --> 01:17:38,253
- We didn't kill
Sam for money!

1169
01:17:38,353 --> 01:17:39,587
We didn't
have a choice.

1170
01:17:39,688 --> 01:17:41,589
He wouldn't keep
to his part of the deal.

1171
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:43,191
- Deal?

1172
01:17:43,291 --> 01:17:44,626
What-- what deal?

1173
01:17:46,461 --> 01:17:48,596
- If he didn't come on board,

1174
01:17:48,697 --> 01:17:51,533
Jean would meet with
an unfortunate accident!

1175
01:17:51,633 --> 01:17:54,336
- What? So you
traded Jean's life

1176
01:17:54,436 --> 01:17:56,538
for Sam's co-operation?

1177
01:17:57,839 --> 01:17:59,741
How did you drag him into this?

1178
01:17:59,841 --> 01:18:02,177
- Well, he was the one
that discovered the drug.

1179
01:18:02,277 --> 01:18:04,446
In a research lab in Mexico.

1180
01:18:04,546 --> 01:18:07,115
He was the only one that
could bring it into the country.

1181
01:18:07,215 --> 01:18:08,717
Now Charlotte...

1182
01:18:08,817 --> 01:18:11,553
Charlotte saw
the opportunity immediately.

1183
01:18:11,653 --> 01:18:14,556
She didn't need to wait
7 years for FDA approval.

1184
01:18:14,656 --> 01:18:16,091
It was her
idea, really.

1185
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:17,659
We needed him.

1186
01:18:17,759 --> 01:18:19,394
- Why did you kill him?

1187
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:27,335
Part of the deal

1188
01:18:27,435 --> 01:18:30,472
was that he was to forget
about his life in Chicago.

1189
01:18:30,572 --> 01:18:32,207
Permanently.

1190
01:18:32,307 --> 01:18:34,275
We set up the boating accident.

1191
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:38,046
Everything worked
beautifully... for a while.

1192
01:18:38,146 --> 01:18:41,049
But that fool...
he couldn't forget about her.

1193
01:18:41,149 --> 01:18:42,317
- Jean.

1194
01:18:42,417 --> 01:18:43,618
- He knew what would happen

1195
01:18:43,718 --> 01:18:45,086
if he went back.

1196
01:18:45,186 --> 01:18:46,688
- But he couldn't
live without her.

1197
01:18:46,788 --> 01:18:48,390
- So he didn't get
to live at all.

1198
01:18:50,125 --> 01:18:53,361
We couldn't take the chance
they'd go to the police!

1199
01:18:53,461 --> 01:18:55,163
If he'd been able
to forget about Jean...

1200
01:18:56,331 --> 01:18:57,766
He'd still be alive today.

1201
01:18:57,866 --> 01:18:59,401
- Where is she?

1202
01:19:01,469 --> 01:19:04,372
Where is she?
You tell me where she is!

1203
01:19:04,472 --> 01:19:05,407
Where is she?

1204
01:19:20,889 --> 01:19:22,524
- Save your energy.

1205
01:19:26,694 --> 01:19:27,796
- HELP!

1206
01:19:27,896 --> 01:19:29,230
HELP!

1207
01:19:29,330 --> 01:19:31,199
- Shh. Save your breath.

1208
01:19:31,299 --> 01:19:33,468
There's no one around
here who can hear you.

1209
01:19:33,568 --> 01:19:35,637
- What did you do to Eddie?

1210
01:19:37,372 --> 01:19:39,274
Don't worry about Eddie.

1211
01:19:39,374 --> 01:19:41,543
I'm sure he and Chris

1212
01:19:41,643 --> 01:19:43,678
are coming to
some kind of understanding.

1213
01:19:43,778 --> 01:19:45,780
- What are you talking about?
What understanding?

1214
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:46,848
- I'm talking--

1215
01:19:47,949 --> 01:19:48,883
Excuse me.

1216
01:19:53,955 --> 01:19:55,690
I'm sorry, Mrs. Brooks.

1217
01:19:57,258 --> 01:20:00,161
It looks like the
negotiations fell through.

1218
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:12,540
Well, I know you've
always been keen

1219
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:15,477
on wondering what
happened to dear Sam.

1220
01:20:15,577 --> 01:20:17,479
Well...

1221
01:20:17,579 --> 01:20:19,514
I'm gonna satisfy
your curiosity.

1222
01:20:20,882 --> 01:20:25,220
Arzac. Does wonders
on cancerous cells.

1223
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:27,489
And on the right dosage,

1224
01:20:27,589 --> 01:20:30,925
it does wonders on
uncooperative elements.

1225
01:20:33,228 --> 01:20:35,864
- So you killed Sam just because

1226
01:20:35,964 --> 01:20:38,466
he wouldn't go through with
your little business venture?

1227
01:20:38,566 --> 01:20:41,870
- No, it's...
not so little, actually.

1228
01:20:41,970 --> 01:20:46,174
I'm talking about millions
and millions of dollars here.

1229
01:20:46,274 --> 01:20:48,843
[Laughing]:
What an idiot!

1230
01:20:48,943 --> 01:20:50,545
He knew the risks.

1231
01:20:50,645 --> 01:20:52,514
And he still couldn't live

1232
01:20:52,614 --> 01:20:54,315
without his
precious little wife.

1233
01:20:55,617 --> 01:20:57,485
My little brother

1234
01:20:57,585 --> 01:21:00,388
always loved you too much.

1235
01:21:00,488 --> 01:21:02,290
- Denise?

1236
01:21:08,763 --> 01:21:09,697
NO!

1237
01:21:13,568 --> 01:21:15,370
[Screaming]: NO!

1238
01:21:16,437 --> 01:21:17,305
NO!

1239
01:21:19,874 --> 01:21:21,910
- Drop it. DROP IT!

1240
01:21:24,445 --> 01:21:26,214
Don't move!

1241
01:21:26,314 --> 01:21:27,882
I SAID, DON'T MOVE!

1242
01:21:35,557 --> 01:21:36,858
- Are you OK?

1243
01:21:36,958 --> 01:21:37,992
- You all right?

1244
01:21:42,697 --> 01:21:44,299
- The cops are
on their way.

1245
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:45,300
- Are you OK?

1246
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:46,534
- I'm all right. You OK?

1247
01:21:46,634 --> 01:21:47,535
- Yeah.

1248
01:21:53,308 --> 01:21:54,976
- It's all right. It's OK.

1249
01:21:55,076 --> 01:21:56,411
It's OK.

1250
01:22:06,888 --> 01:22:08,623
- Do you remember me?

1251
01:22:08,723 --> 01:22:11,626
- Yes. You left
before I finished!

1252
01:22:12,794 --> 01:22:14,395
- Could you do
a reading now?

1253
01:22:15,496 --> 01:22:16,798
- Please, have a seat.

1254
01:22:28,977 --> 01:22:30,979
The last judgement.

1255
01:22:32,647 --> 01:22:34,716
There is a change in your world.

1256
01:22:35,984 --> 01:22:37,452
A renewal of good.

1257
01:22:42,890 --> 01:22:44,292
Lovers.

1258
01:22:44,392 --> 01:22:47,662
There's a new love
in your life, and with it

1259
01:22:47,762 --> 01:22:50,965
comes the choice
to accept it, or not.

1260
01:22:56,537 --> 01:22:57,672
The chariot.

1261
01:22:59,073 --> 01:23:01,342
It refers to travel.

1262
01:23:02,610 --> 01:23:04,545
Hmm. A long trip.

1263
01:23:09,617 --> 01:23:10,918
This is all very good.

1264
01:23:12,153 --> 01:23:15,690
This is a very wonderful card.

1265
01:23:15,790 --> 01:23:19,527
The magician. It refers
to your capacity to love.

1266
01:23:19,627 --> 01:23:21,863
It's good that you came back.

1267
01:23:28,936 --> 01:23:30,471
- Thank you.

1268
01:23:47,522 --> 01:23:49,123
- So how did it go?

1269
01:23:49,223 --> 01:23:52,493
- Well, she said we're
gonna have a lot of kids.

1270
01:23:54,028 --> 01:23:56,397
[Laughing]: Just kidding.

1271
01:23:56,497 --> 01:23:58,633
- Let's start
with Milan first.

1272
01:23:58,733 --> 01:23:59,734
- OK.
