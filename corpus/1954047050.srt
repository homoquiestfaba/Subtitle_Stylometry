1
00:00:45,442 --> 00:00:46,811
A couple of hours, I think?

2
00:00:46,835 --> 00:00:48,597
It's not enough.

3
00:00:48,597 --> 00:00:51,549
- I naturally don't need a lot of sleep.
- I can't have you in the CIC

4
00:00:51,615 --> 00:00:53,325
like this.
You're on the verge

5
00:00:53,393 --> 00:00:55,337
of seing ghosts
on the dradis screen.

6
00:00:55,561 --> 00:00:56,543
I'm fine, sir.

7
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,712
- I swear.
- It's a gift, son.

8
00:00:58,836 --> 00:01:00,529
It's not a punishment.

9
00:01:00,529 --> 00:01:02,765
Go over to the Zephyr, get drunk,

10
00:01:02,831 --> 00:01:04,417
sleep for a week,

11
00:01:04,517 --> 00:01:06,517
recover.

12
00:01:06,674 --> 00:01:08,902
Shuttle leaves twice a day.

13
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:10,802
You better hurry.

14
00:01:23,674 --> 00:01:25,174
Felix

15
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,264
You owe me a big favor.

16
00:01:32,364 --> 00:01:34,164
Morph is a tough gap.

17
00:01:34,212 --> 00:01:35,488
Thank you.

18
00:01:38,788 --> 00:01:41,284
- If I didn't...
- Go. It'll be better.

19
00:01:41,384 --> 00:01:43,055
I'll be waiting.

20
00:01:43,155 --> 00:01:45,435
Heading back to the CIC.

21
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:12,757
Hey, Brooks.

22
00:02:12,857 --> 00:02:15,669
- You're going to the Z too?
- Yeah, no fun for me.

23
00:02:15,792 --> 00:02:17,792
Maintenance detail.

24
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,690
Oh, great. Skinjobs.

25
00:02:25,251 --> 00:02:27,251
What?

26
00:02:44,145 --> 00:02:45,701
Welcome aboard the Zephyr shuttle,

27
00:02:45,868 --> 00:02:49,046
ladies and gents, we'll be arriving
at our destination in 15 minutes.

28
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,758
There's no inflight service today,

29
00:02:50,925 --> 00:02:53,594
so please refrain from drinking
unless you're willing to share

30
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,850
with your flight crew.

31
00:03:03,464 --> 00:03:06,427
Zephyr approach,
Raptor 7-1-8 inbound, out of marker.

32
00:03:06,593 --> 00:03:08,792
Raptor 7-1-8, Zephyr approach.

33
00:03:08,892 --> 00:03:10,833
Dradis contact 1600, heading

34
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:13,963
4-2-7, carom 2-2-5.
Order inner marquer to sequency.

35
00:03:14,063 --> 00:03:16,309
Copy all, 4-2-7 carom 2-2-5

36
00:03:16,432 --> 00:03:18,684
put to the inner marker.
ETA 15 minutes.

37
00:03:18,784 --> 00:03:21,243
Fleet, Galactica.
Inbound cylon hostiles.

38
00:03:21,343 --> 00:03:24,433
All ships, emergency jump.
I say again, emergency jump.

39
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,798
- Prepare to jump.
- Can't we just get to Zephyr?

40
00:03:26,922 --> 00:03:29,912
Calculation's complete.
Jumping in three, two,

41
00:03:30,078 --> 00:03:32,078
- one.
- Jump.

42
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,520
Where is the fleet?

43
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:02,497
Any ship, Raptor 7-1-8, please respond.
Any ship respond.

44
00:04:03,298 --> 00:04:06,785
Any ship, Raptor 7-1-8, please respond.
Any ship respond.

45
00:04:06,601 --> 00:04:09,279
- I entered the coordinates right.
- Godsdamn him Cap.

46
00:04:09,408 --> 00:04:12,001
- Jump us back.
- They'll leave a Raptor behind, right?

47
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:14,052
That depends. If they don't want
to give away our location...

48
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:15,780
That true.

49
00:04:15,842 --> 00:04:17,839
Cavil's baseships
could be out there anywhere.

50
00:04:18,093 --> 00:04:19,693
Exactly.

51
00:04:19,754 --> 00:04:22,483
They'd know we didn't make it.
They'd leave somebody.

52
00:04:22,518 --> 00:04:24,413
Maybe.

53
00:04:24,468 --> 00:04:26,893
- Jump drive's not responding.
- What? What's the frak?

54
00:04:27,025 --> 00:04:29,492
- Why not?
- Give me a sec.

55
00:04:30,925 --> 00:04:34,214
Poseidon,
please protect us from death...

56
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:35,919
Poseidon, please protect...

57
00:04:35,983 --> 00:04:37,789
A Poseidon medal?

58
00:04:37,847 --> 00:04:42,056
- Hey, we're a long way from water.
- It's a ship, isn't it?

59
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,165
I know why the drive
is not responding.

60
00:04:45,188 --> 00:04:47,745
We jumped over the red line.

61
00:04:47,784 --> 00:04:50,610
So now we can't even
jump back to where we started?

62
00:04:50,641 --> 00:04:52,695
Our calculations just got nonlinear!

63
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,993
I knew I didn't recognize
these star patterns.

64
00:04:55,088 --> 00:04:57,596
You can recognize star patterns
with the naked eye?

65
00:04:57,686 --> 00:05:00,265
They've never sent us so far.
I must have frakked up the coordinates.

66
00:05:00,353 --> 00:05:01,865
Or you didn't.

67
00:05:01,932 --> 00:05:04,299
If a high energy charge
subatomic particle had hit us,

68
00:05:04,588 --> 00:05:07,078
it could have randomly flipped
one bit of data in our jump coordinates.

69
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,939
It got entered correctly,
but corrupted.

70
00:05:09,974 --> 00:05:13,737
So, something flips from 1 to 0
sends us to parking end of no place.

71
00:05:13,835 --> 00:05:16,504
We don't know where the fleet is
and if we did, we couldn't go there.

72
00:05:16,636 --> 00:05:18,367
Cavil's enemy baseships

73
00:05:18,328 --> 00:05:20,807
- could be out there anywhere.
- Quiet, let me think.

74
00:05:21,141 --> 00:05:23,544
Calculations are nonlinear,
but they're not impossible.

75
00:05:23,636 --> 00:05:26,210
But we don't know where we are.
There's still a chance I frakked up!

76
00:05:26,298 --> 00:05:27,948
Don't you recognize me, Felix?

77
00:05:28,012 --> 00:05:29,909
It makes sense.
There's a star cluster...

78
00:05:29,994 --> 00:05:31,891
It's me.

79
00:05:37,756 --> 00:05:41,023
Pull yourself together, Lieutenant.

80
00:05:41,044 --> 00:05:43,677
- They know where the fleet is.
- That's my point, Sir.

81
00:05:43,764 --> 00:05:46,434
There was a false alarm.
Everyone has jumped back.

82
00:05:46,468 --> 00:05:49,103
Over two days, they're not here.

83
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,437
Just give me a Raptor and a pilot.

84
00:05:51,531 --> 00:05:53,528
And what would you do with that?

85
00:05:53,591 --> 00:05:55,488
Jump randomly?

86
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:58,358
There is something in the universe.

87
00:05:58,401 --> 00:06:00,611
Something let us find Earth,
dead as it is.

88
00:06:00,704 --> 00:06:02,701
And I know, I know I can find Felix.

89
00:06:02,711 --> 00:06:05,748
- Lieutenant...
- Me and Felix...

90
00:06:08,941 --> 00:06:12,263
There's been too much loss already.

91
00:06:15,633 --> 00:06:18,368
I'll have to run it by the old man.

92
00:06:18,403 --> 00:06:20,400
Thank you, sir.

93
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,692
Thank you.

94
00:06:37,047 --> 00:06:40,216
Enough food and water for two weeks
if we're not fussy about recycling,

95
00:06:40,295 --> 00:06:42,368
so our limiting factor is...

96
00:06:44,898 --> 00:06:46,783
air.

97
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,737
20 hours's left.

98
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,472
Of course, shuttle-dee-doo.

99
00:06:50,534 --> 00:06:54,450
On a Raptor with clapped out
CO2 scrubbers, frak you very much.

100
00:06:54,451 --> 00:06:56,627
Every breath counts now, folks.

101
00:06:56,675 --> 00:06:59,150
We've got to limit exertion,
sleep as much as we can.

102
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,237
20 hours. My Gods.

103
00:07:01,814 --> 00:07:04,097
After it thinned the air,
pulled it into the tanks,

104
00:07:04,233 --> 00:07:07,386
we're at 68% ship normal load of O2.

105
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,529
68!

106
00:07:09,488 --> 00:07:12,744
At that level, you're talking
memory loss, irrational behavior,

107
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:16,139
- depression, dizziness...
- Better dizzy than dead.

108
00:07:24,265 --> 00:07:27,523
Aren't you frakkin' lucky
to got a mechanic on board?

109
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:31,003
I'll have a look at these scrubbers.

110
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:43,862
Alright, let's see what we got.

111
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,163
You're her!

112
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:31,190
Godsdammit!

113
00:08:31,257 --> 00:08:33,176
Come on.

114
00:08:34,191 --> 00:08:36,210
There's a loose connection there.
I just...

115
00:08:36,211 --> 00:08:39,191
- I just can't get inside.
- Let me do it.

116
00:08:39,224 --> 00:08:41,321
- Come on.
- No, let me do it.

117
00:08:41,867 --> 00:08:43,886
Alright, be my guest.

118
00:08:45,106 --> 00:08:48,183
You shouldn't even be in there.
You're gonna make it worse.

119
00:08:48,239 --> 00:08:50,924
- Alright. You see it?
- Yep.

120
00:08:58,059 --> 00:08:59,878
Got it!

121
00:09:14,876 --> 00:09:16,571
No pulse, she's dead.

122
00:09:16,631 --> 00:09:20,103
My Gods! I was just doing that!
I was doing that same thing!

123
00:09:20,221 --> 00:09:22,440
Look at her pliers.

124
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:28,729
The insulating grip
has been stripped off.

125
00:09:28,753 --> 00:09:30,772
Who did this?

126
00:09:37,574 --> 00:09:39,462
Old as frak.

127
00:09:39,561 --> 00:09:40,753
Grip wore off.

128
00:09:41,054 --> 00:09:44,532
Or someone didn't like the idea
of a machine breathing their air.

129
00:09:45,691 --> 00:09:46,691
What?

130
00:09:47,217 --> 00:09:48,409
Those were mine.

131
00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:50,993
- I was supposed to get killed.
- Unless you did it.

132
00:09:51,689 --> 00:09:54,074
- I mean, you didn't notice bare metal?
- What?

133
00:09:54,174 --> 00:09:56,261
What are you saying guys?
We're using up air.

134
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,944
- Are you accusing me?
- Shut the frak up!

135
00:10:01,031 --> 00:10:03,019
It was an accident.

136
00:10:03,217 --> 00:10:05,205
What are we gonna do with her?

137
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,578
Jettison her.

138
00:10:13,951 --> 00:10:15,739
We have to.

139
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,024
We can pull air into our tanks
and open the door.

140
00:10:18,223 --> 00:10:20,111
- No. We'd lose air.
- Only a little.

141
00:10:20,311 --> 00:10:22,895
She's gonna start giving off
methane and hydrogen sulfide.

142
00:10:23,094 --> 00:10:25,777
No. She's right.
We gotta get rid of the body

143
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:27,963
and then we can figure out
what to do next.

144
00:10:28,359 --> 00:10:30,347
Flight suits.

145
00:10:36,806 --> 00:10:38,794
Give me that.

146
00:10:39,788 --> 00:10:41,377
I've an idea how to get us home,

147
00:10:41,477 --> 00:10:44,161
- but I need your help.
- What do you mean?

148
00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:47,043
I'll tell you when they're asleep.
Trust me, okay?

149
00:11:06,323 --> 00:11:08,310
This list...

150
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:11,093
Some of these people
I haven't seen in a long time.

151
00:11:13,081 --> 00:11:15,068
They may already be...

152
00:11:16,161 --> 00:11:17,751
Gods.

153
00:11:17,752 --> 00:11:19,938
The Ones, they keep good records.

154
00:11:20,037 --> 00:11:22,124
If somebody's locked up,
I can find them.

155
00:11:22,522 --> 00:11:24,210
And get them out.

156
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:26,398
We can do this.

157
00:11:32,562 --> 00:11:34,550
Really.

158
00:11:48,861 --> 00:11:51,445
Buckle in, Lt. Let's go hunting.

159
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,600
This one, Jeremiah,
he died in detention, he got sick.

160
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,600
And...

161
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,700
She...

162
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
She killed herself.

163
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,600
But these two...

164
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,700
I got them out.

165
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,700
But nobody...

166
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,500
Nobody knows
what happened to the child.

167
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,200
- I tried so hard.
- Hey, you did great.

168
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,300
- I tried so hard!
- You saved so many of them.

169
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,400
Okay?

170
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm sorry.

171
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,400
You can think of more names
and we can write more lists.

172
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,400
Of course we can.

173
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,200
Of course we can.
We will.

174
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,300
- Yeah.
- Okay?

175
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,400
Thank you.

176
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:59,550
Felix

177
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,300
Listen.

178
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,300
Okay, listen.

179
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,900
There's something I can do.

180
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I can interface
with the Raptor's computer

181
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,100
and determine
the corrupted memory address.

182
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,400
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

183
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,800
Yeah, wait, I remember you.

184
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,400
You did that once...
One of you did that once.

185
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,300
It's who you are, am I right?

186
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,000
But if the others see me doing it,

187
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,200
they'll think I'm sabotaging the ship,
so you'll have to stand guard.

188
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,300
How?

189
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,300
Brooks?

190
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,800
What's wrong?
Something's wrong.

191
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,600
Hey, wake up.

192
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,600
Lethal dose.

193
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,400
What's going on?

194
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,600
- I won't tell them.
- Oh my Gods!

195
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:15,500
- I heard you moving around.
- What did she do? What did you do?

196
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,200
- I told you she killed the other one.
- I won't say anything.

197
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,300
Thanks, buddy.

198
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,400
Wait! He might have killed himself.
We don't know.

199
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,300
- That's it.
- And you wanna take a chance?

200
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,900
- We don't know. We don't know!
- It's okay.

201
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,900
I understand.

202
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It's okay.

203
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,800
It's okay.

204
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,100
There's nothing here.
Frak!

205
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,400
Um, sorry.

206
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,600
Spin the dial.

207
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,900
I owe Ishay a big favor.

208
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,100
Morpha's a tough get.

209
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,200
Go. Feel better.
I'll be waiting.

210
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,100
Don't you recognize me, Felix?

211
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,100
Oh, great, skinjobs.

212
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,300
You undid those yourself?

213
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,200
You're gonna tie me up again?

214
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,400
No.

215
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,700
I was gonna untie you.
- That's trusting.

216
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,200
Don't wake them.

217
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,600
You're going home.

218
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,500
Really?

219
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,600
It looks like it hurts.
- It does.

220
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,100
Can you...?

221
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,400
It's easier if somebody else...
- Of course.

222
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,400
Here we go.

223
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,000
Get it in. Oh Gods.

224
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,700
Thank you.

225
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,000
Oh, there...

226
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,500
It's making me lightheaded.

227
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,600
You all right?

228
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,800
I'm trying to project, but...

229
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,700
The low oxygen is making
everything so hard.

230
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,800
Okay, where are you projecting?

231
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,000
You know where I am.

232
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,100
I have someone now.

233
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,200
Good.

234
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,200
You deserve it.

235
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,200
You always did.

236
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,300
Oh, I've found it.
The bit that flipped.

237
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,600
You were right.
I can take us home.

238
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,700
Memory address 5A25.

239
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,300
Felix, this is it.

240
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,300
Get ready to jump.
I'm taking us home.

241
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,000
I was happy you guys got together.

242
00:20:41,035 --> 00:20:43,300
Been makin' book on it, for...

243
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,265
Since forever.

244
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,700
Took you long enough.
- Yeah, well...

245
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,200
He's got this...

246
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,000
this fire about doing
the right thing.

247
00:20:55,035 --> 00:20:57,000
A moral core, huh?

248
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:01,100
You don't see a lot of that.
- No, no, you don't.

249
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:05,700
Guess it's 'cause they can
get you so killed.

250
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,500
Frak me, I'm sorry, I didn't...
- It's okay.

251
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,600
Let's keep looking.

252
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,100
Jump completed.

253
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,400
Hang on.

254
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,800
The jump drained
almost all our reserve power.

255
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,200
Frak! Dradis is empty.

256
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,000
If the fleet's here,
we're out of range.

257
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,100
I'll send a pulse.

258
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,165
If they're in this system,

259
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,800
they'll come running,
maybe 10 hours.

260
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,600
Hey, Finn. Finn! Azerin!

261
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,400
Wake up, we jumped.
We're almost home.

262
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,600
Azurin? What?

263
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,500
Gods!

264
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,700
Another empty well.

265
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,000
- Wanna dig another?
- Yeah, of course.

266
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:44,000
- He wouldn't give up on me.
- You got it.

267
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,700
Is this crazy?

268
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,100
Yeah...

269
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,600
I'm sorry, but yeah.

270
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,900
But look, he would give up on you.

271
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:07,500
Eventually, if it didn't make sense
anymore, he'd have to.

272
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,600
He'd understand.

273
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,400
You wanna go home?

274
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,200
Yeah.

275
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,500
You stripped the pliers!

276
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,100
I didn't think
he'd hand them to her,

277
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,600
but it didn't make a difference.

278
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,100
You injected Brooks with my morpha!

279
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,300
He started to wake up
when I took it and put it back,

280
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,400
but you trusted me!

281
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:53,400
- No, no! You killed them all!
- We needed the air.

282
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,100
- No! Gods. What...
- Felix.

283
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,350
I picked you...

284
00:24:00,385 --> 00:24:02,300
over my own kind...

285
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,700
over my own model.

286
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,000
I protected you from something
you never could have done

287
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,200
but you were thinking all along.

288
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,000
I couldn't. I wouldn't.
No one could!

289
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,600
That is not true.

290
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,000
There is a fine line
between ignorance and hope.

291
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:32,500
I would have thought
you'd have learned that by now.

292
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,100
- What are you talking about?
- Felix!

293
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,400
You have to open your eyes.

294
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,300
You have to see
what the world is really like!

295
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,900
You gave me the names, Felix!

296
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
The rest was easy.

297
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,400
Kill everyone on this list.

298
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,600
I'd tell you that they'd run off...

299
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,700
or...

300
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,400
they were at the infirmary.

301
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:10,100
Some of them I'd say I saw them
eating with their families.

302
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,400
"Didn't you see them?
Oh, I'm sure you'll see them tomorrow."

303
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:17,600
Didn't you see them?
I'm sure you'll see them tomorrow.

304
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,800
No. I remember, I saw... I saw them,

305
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,500
I know I saw them.
They can't be...

306
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,700
I saw Jenkins.

307
00:25:26,735 --> 00:25:28,700
I saw Penbroke.

308
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,165
I saw them.

309
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,200
I saved a few...

310
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
so you could make yourself
not know about the rest...

311
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,100
I saw...

312
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,765
I saw...

313
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,500
Heather Redmond and her baby.
They were playing together.

314
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,700
I saw them. I know I saw them...

315
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,100
I'm a woman...

316
00:25:50,135 --> 00:25:52,000
and a Cylon.

317
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,750
I didn't seduce you.

318
00:25:54,785 --> 00:25:56,700
Hope seduced you.

319
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:02,000
And the more you ate of it,
the less you saw.

320
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,600
You ate yourself blind.

321
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,300
Why didn't you just kill us
when you knew that we were lost?

322
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,400
I'm not a monster.

323
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,600
I didn't want to do what I did. I did it
when the probabilities dictated it.

324
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,800
You kill when you're in a war.

325
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,200
You kill when you have to.

326
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,500
You kill the ones your enemy values.

327
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,200
It's basic. You should know that.

328
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,300
I trusted you.

329
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,800
How could I have guessed?

330
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,600
Baltar did.

331
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,200
Oh, what, he didn't tell you?

332
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,100
Or did you block that out too?

333
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,700
<i>What did you tell them?</i>

334
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,100
That you stayed behind
till the grisly end on New Caprica,

335
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,000
so that you could, what?
So you could...

336
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:53,000
You could feed information
to the resistance.

337
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:56,200
Who do you think
allowed you to do that?

338
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,200
- That's a lie.
- No, it's not a lie.

339
00:26:58,235 --> 00:27:00,200
You think I'm blind?

340
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,400
You see, I literally had a gun...

341
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,500
pointed to my head.

342
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,300
But nobody forced you
to play both sides.

343
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:30,800
There's not much difference
between my brain and yours, Felix.

344
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,665
We can choose...

345
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,300
to not make the connection!

346
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,200
You can see someone kill
in front of you...

347
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,965
twice...

348
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,400
and still hang on to your ignorance.

349
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,800
Instead of calling it a flaw,
you call it...

350
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,750
hope, or...

351
00:27:49,785 --> 00:27:51,700
faith...

352
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:52,965
love.

353
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,400
<i>So, I'm asking you Mr. Gaeta...</i>

354
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,000
who is the real traitor
in this room?

355
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,865
- I'm not a traitor.
- No, of course,

356
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,800
because there are far worse things
than being a traitor, aren't there?

357
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:08,500
If your friends
only knew the truth...

358
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,200
But don't worry...
I know about your little secret.

359
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,400
I know what your Eight did!

360
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,665
<i>Raptor seven-eighteen,</i>

361
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:04,400
<i>Raptor seven-eighteen, you copy?</i>

362
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,100
We did it.

363
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,400
She did it.

364
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,700
Galactica, come in.

365
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,165
<i>Galactica.</i>

366
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:27,100
You're nowhere near the fleet, baby,
but you're good!

367
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,300
Strange things can happen
when you're away from the fleet.

368
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:14,500
I wouldn't even trust
your own memories on this.

369
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,700
And since a human
is the sole survivor,

370
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,300
the old man isn't inclined
to make an issue out of it

371
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,500
and risk the alliance.

372
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,300
Sir...

373
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,600
There shouldn't be an alliance.

374
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,500
Cylon technology is gonna keep
this fleet movin',

375
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,000
- Mr. Gaeta.
- I need to speak to the Admiral.

376
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,100
Why would that be?

377
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,100
Because you're a Cylon, sir.

378
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:52,500
There's a meeting later today
to discuss some new idea of Mr. Tyrol's.

379
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:57,000
You can let the Admiral in
on your views there.

380
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,765
Yes, sir.

381
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,800
Thank you, sir.

382
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,265
Felix, I don't understand.

383
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,265
Why would you set up
a meeting with him?

384
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:18,000
- I shouldn't have said it. Forget it.
- What are you doing?

385
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,565
Look.

386
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,700
You found me and you saved me,
so I'll protect you.

387
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,800
But if this doesn't work out,

388
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,900
and if I'm wrong...

389
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,900
You have a bright future, Louis.

390
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,100
What are you talking about?
If what doesn't work?

391
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,200
Keep your head down.

392
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,400
What are you going to do?
