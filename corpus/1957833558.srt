That one's Darren's.

on the couch just fine.

108

113
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:35,282
- Sure.

114
00:08:37,118 --> 00:08:39,151

123
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:09,016

135
00:10:54,889 --> 00:10:56,790
I can't smell it on her.

136
00:10:59,093 --> 00:11:02,694
I won't lie, she doesn't look

Yeah, I gotta go.

Yeah, work is steady.

143

144
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:27,188
Darren's there too.

145
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:30,355

I'm good at it.

148
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:36,230
- It's funny,

149
00:11:38,032 --> 00:11:40,301
I always thought you'd be a rock
star.

150
00:11:41,503 --> 00:11:42,736
- Since when?

151
00:11:44,205 --> 00:11:46,941
- Well, since I bought you that
guitar.

152
00:11:51,045 --> 00:11:52,379
You still play it?

153
00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:55,783
- Not so much anymore.

154
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:00,085
How about these?

155
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:02,955
- No, I'll get this, I'll get
this.

156
00:12:02,957 --> 00:12:03,922
- It's fine.

157
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:07,328
- I don't need my son buying me
underwear.

158
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:11,964
God, it's always such a mess in
here!

159
00:12:11,966 --> 00:12:12,864
God.

- Yeah.

164
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:29,248
- I knew you would.

165
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,817
- I told her we were having a
nice day, that you were good!

166
00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:33,352
- Did she tell you you're a
liar?

167
00:12:33,354 --> 00:12:35,956
(James laughs)

168
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:39,825
- So what's your plan?

169
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:43,962
- I don't know, I'll
spend some time with you.

170
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:48,102
Why? You want me to get
out of here already?

171
00:12:49,571 --> 00:12:52,137
- What about going home?

172
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:54,873
- To mom and dad? Are
you out of your mind?

173
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:55,543
- No, home.

174
00:12:57,478 --> 00:12:59,446
- Oh, to Dutch and Nancy.

175
00:13:01,382 --> 00:13:05,350
No, they're the reason I am the
way I am.

176
00:13:05,352 --> 00:13:06,186
No.

177
00:13:08,322 --> 00:13:11,023
Hey, you wanna go to the zoo?

178
00:13:11,025 --> 00:13:13,392
- The zoo? Those places are
terrible.

179
00:13:13,394 --> 00:13:15,427
- I used to take you all time.

180
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:16,495
- Animals are meant to be in the
wild

181
00:13:16,497 --> 00:13:18,363
and we put them in cages.

182
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:20,465
How'd you like it if people
stood around

183
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:21,534
watching you suffer?

184
00:13:21,536 --> 00:13:23,201
- They do.

185
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:25,105
- Then don't go to zoos.

186
00:13:26,407 --> 00:13:28,206
(James scoffs)
(Leslie grunting)

187
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:29,544
Mom! I'm so sorry.

188
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:32,578
Stop! (laughs)

189
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,148
What are you doing?

190
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:38,483
- You on one of them dating
apps?

191
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:42,524
Picking out girls like
youse fishing with dynamite?

192
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:45,457
- I don't have time for that.

193
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:47,259
- [Leslie] Don't have time to
have fun?

194
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:50,429
- I'm working, trying to put
back.

195
00:13:50,431 --> 00:13:53,298
- Ah, you're trying to
do what I didn't do.

196
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,303
Well, I'm glad I taught you
something.

197
00:14:11,452 --> 00:14:15,053
- Before I leave, I wanna
go over some ground rules.

198
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:15,923
- Oh, okay.

199
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:21,960
- You can stay here as long
as you need to make a plan.

200
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:24,129
Long as you need.

201
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:26,066
But you can't live here.

202
00:14:27,401 --> 00:14:28,603
You need a plan.

203
00:14:30,638 --> 00:14:31,472
- Okay.

204
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:35,140
- And no drinking.

205
00:14:35,142 --> 00:14:37,075
- Baby, I don't drink no more.

206
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:38,343
- [James] We can smoke
pot, that's fine, but-

207
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:42,983
- Baby, I don't drink like I
used to.

208
00:14:47,689 --> 00:14:52,259
- Okay, see you tomorrow?

209
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:02,604
- Good night.

210
00:15:05,707 --> 00:15:06,606
(birds chirping)

211
00:15:06,608 --> 00:15:07,507
- I'll be home around 6:00.

212
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:10,645
Just, we can take a walk or
something.

213
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:24,590
- I'll be just fine.

214
00:15:24,592 --> 00:15:25,426
- Okay.

215
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:33,568

218
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:20,680
- Hi! I'm Leslie, I'm James's
mama.

219
00:16:20,682 --> 00:16:22,515
- [Will] Oh, I remember.

00:16:22,517 --> 00:16:24,282
Heading out for the day?

221
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:26,084
- Well, yeah, he needs some
milk.

222
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:29,087
- Oh, little Jimmy needs
milk for his cereal?

223
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:30,658
Well, have a good one!

you all saw each other?

249
00:17:30,718 --> 00:17:32,752
- It must been six years.

250
00:17:32,754 --> 00:17:35,721
- [Darren] Damn, six years? How
come?

251
00:17:35,723 --> 00:17:37,823
- Hey, will you mind
your own business? Jesus.

252
00:17:37,825 --> 00:17:38,760
- He's fine.

253
00:17:40,695 --> 00:17:43,763
He don't need me riding him
the way my mama rode me.

254
00:17:43,765 --> 00:17:46,264
- That's James's grandma?

255
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:47,467
What's she like?

256
00:17:49,804 --> 00:17:51,236
- Baptist.

257
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:56,174

258
00:17:56,176 --> 00:17:58,778
(all laugh)

259
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,480
- You two are funny.

260
00:18:01,516 --> 00:18:04,115
- I mean, what's wrong with
going to Dutch and Nancy's?

261
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:06,652
- Those people are evil.

262
00:18:06,654 --> 00:18:08,253
- They're fine.

263
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,388
- You don't know 'em like I do.

264
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,727
- You don't know 'em like I do.

265
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:19,734
Are you good in here?

266
00:18:24,204 --> 00:18:24,839
What?

267
00:18:32,513 --> 00:18:34,816
- I'm just stoned, is all.

268
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:40,253
Night night, sweetie.

269
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:42,790

Hey, you seen my mom?

278
00:20:13,581 --> 00:20:14,613
- No, everything okay?

279
00:20:14,615 --> 00:20:16,281
- Chris? Nothing?

280
00:20:16,283 --> 00:20:17,016
- No.

281
00:20:17,018 --> 00:20:17,883
- Everything alright?

282
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:19,854

(man faintly speaking)

286
00:20:35,302 --> 00:20:36,301
- [Group] Yeah.

287
00:20:36,303 --> 00:20:37,002
- [Man] That's right, okay.

288
00:20:37,004 --> 00:20:38,504
Now, (faintly speaking).

289
00:20:38,506 --> 00:20:41,372
(footsteps pattering)

290
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:42,608
- Where have you been?

291
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:43,542
(door shuts)

292
00:20:43,544 --> 00:20:44,677
- Well, you're home early!

293
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:47,546
- I've been all over town
looking for you.

294
00:20:47,548 --> 00:20:49,380
- I was here, baby, watching TV.

295
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:50,850
- Mom?!

296
00:20:50,852 --> 00:20:53,485
- I was here and I went for a
walk

297
00:20:53,487 --> 00:20:57,625
'cause I've been cooped up in
here.

298
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:03,461
So I went looking for a job.

299
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:05,731
- [James] A job?
- Yeah.

300
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:09,003
Gonna get my plan - you
know, figure out my plan.

301
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:14,876
Hey, what's wrong? Are you okay?

302
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:18,677
Honey, are you okay?

303
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:20,613
- What kind of job?

304
00:21:20,615 --> 00:21:21,680
- What kind?

305
00:21:21,682 --> 00:21:25,416
(laughs) Any kind!

306
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:28,288
(laughs) Any kind.

307
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,424
- Were you next door?

308
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,561
(Leslie scoffs)

309
00:21:35,563 --> 00:21:37,530
Jesus fucking Christ!

310
00:21:37,532 --> 00:21:40,735
- Baby, baby, baby!

311
00:21:42,335 --> 00:21:45,403
Baby? Oh!

312
00:21:45,405 --> 00:21:48,373
(James knocks)

313
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:49,708
- [James] Was she in here-

314
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:50,576
- [Will] Hey, man, look-
- When I was talking to you?

315
00:21:50,578 --> 00:21:51,476
- [Will] We was just having a
beer.

316
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:52,443
- You were having a beer with my
mother?

317
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:53,344
- [Will] I didn't know that was
a problem.

318
00:21:53,346 --> 00:21:55,413
- [James] No? Then why'd you lie
about it?

319
00:21:55,415 --> 00:21:56,481
- [Will] Because she
freaked when she heard you.

320
00:21:56,483 --> 00:21:57,550
Okay, I don't know what's
going on between you two-

321
00:21:57,552 --> 00:21:59,752
- Don't talk to her again!
Don't talk to her again!

322
00:21:59,754 --> 00:22:00,986
- Dude, you need to calm down!

323
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:03,055
- Oh, come on!
- Come on, come on!

324
00:22:03,057 --> 00:22:05,526
(indistinct)

325
00:22:07,995 --> 00:22:10,497
(indistinct)

326
00:22:15,468 --> 00:22:16,969
(indistinct)

327
00:22:16,971 --> 00:22:19,370
- Baby? Baby, baby.

328
00:22:19,372 --> 00:22:20,873
Baby, please, I went out.

329
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:22,608
I was just trying to have
some fun, 'cause it's-

330
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,877
- You stole money from Darren.

331
00:22:24,879 --> 00:22:25,811
- What?

332
00:22:25,813 --> 00:22:26,645
- You stole money from Darren.

333
00:22:26,647 --> 00:22:27,613
- I didn't steal.

334
00:22:27,615 --> 00:22:28,848
Did he tell you that?

335
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:31,083
- Come on, lie to me
again. Lie to me again!

336
00:22:31,085 --> 00:22:34,452
- I'm your mother, I would
not steal money from you.

337
00:22:34,454 --> 00:22:35,386
What are you doing?

338
00:22:35,388 --> 00:22:38,526
Get off of me. (groans)

339
00:22:39,492 --> 00:22:41,428
- Un-fucking-believable!

340
00:22:42,997 --> 00:22:45,099
- You fucking chicken shit!

341
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:46,868
Hey! Baby?

342
00:22:48,903 --> 00:22:51,804
Hey, hey.

343
00:22:51,806 --> 00:22:53,873
- What did I say?! No drinking!

344
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:55,608
(bottle clatters)

345
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:56,809
- I'm your mother, you cannot
talk to me this way, James.

346
00:22:56,811 --> 00:22:58,510
- Mother? Mother?!

347
00:22:58,512 --> 00:22:59,511
- Yes, your momma

348
00:22:59,513 --> 00:23:01,115
stop it.
- You're a drunk!

349
00:23:02,617 --> 00:23:03,584
- I am sick.

350
00:23:07,755 --> 00:23:10,189
- I'm not gonna do this again,
I'm not.

351
00:23:10,191 --> 00:23:11,893
- You? What about me?

352
00:23:14,494 --> 00:23:16,427
We were supposed to have a good
life.

353
00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:17,830
I didn't want this for you.

354
00:23:17,832 --> 00:23:20,666
- I had a good life until you
showed up.

355
00:23:20,668 --> 00:23:22,568
I'm not even 20.

356
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:23,468
I can't even drink yet,

357
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,839
and I have to take care of my
mother?

358
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,042
I have to take care of you?

359
00:23:29,076 --> 00:23:30,976
I made one rule, no drinking,

360
00:23:30,978 --> 00:23:33,814
and you couldn't last a fucking
day!

361
00:23:37,184 --> 00:23:39,186
- I'm sad.

362
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,525
I can't help it.

363
00:23:46,627 --> 00:23:48,627
But I wanna be a good momma.

364
00:23:48,629 --> 00:23:51,597
I wanna be a good momma again.

365
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:54,199
Baby, I wanna be a good momma, I
do.

366
00:23:54,201 --> 00:23:56,170
I love you so much, baby.

367
00:23:57,538 --> 00:23:59,238
Who are you calling?

368
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,175
Are you calling grandma?

369
00:24:02,209 --> 00:24:04,109
You do not call my mother!

370
00:24:04,111 --> 00:24:05,544
She is my mother!

371
00:24:05,546 --> 00:24:07,581
You do not call my mother!

372
00:24:11,986 --> 00:24:14,221
You leave her out of this!

373
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:28,468
(car engine revs)

374
00:24:43,651 --> 00:24:45,951
What are you doing? Why are they
here?

375
00:24:45,953 --> 00:24:48,020
- Taking you to the bus station.

376
00:24:48,022 --> 00:24:48,856
- No baby.

377
00:24:55,162 --> 00:24:57,062
I will not go out again, baby.

378
00:24:57,064 --> 00:24:58,532
- I called Dutch.

379
00:25:01,702 --> 00:25:03,102
- Dutch?

380
00:25:03,104 --> 00:25:06,807
- He's gonna pick you
up when you get to town.

381
00:25:07,975 --> 00:25:10,778
- Baby don't make me go back
there.

382
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:14,148
No, no.

383
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,722
You're just like your grandma!

384
00:25:30,164 --> 00:25:30,998
Baby

385
00:25:36,804 --> 00:25:38,105
I love you so much.

386
00:25:40,307 --> 00:25:41,909
I love you so much.

387
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,979
Don't do this to me.

388
00:25:48,082 --> 00:25:50,317
- I hope that fills your cup.

389
00:25:52,253 --> 00:25:55,220
(door opens)
(door shuts)

390
00:25:55,222 --> 00:25:57,725
(soft music)

391
00:25:58,826 --> 00:26:01,595
(birds chirping)

392
00:26:04,698 --> 00:26:07,835
(soft music continues)

393
00:26:18,946 --> 00:26:21,949
(bus engine revving)

394
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:36,030
(car horn honks)

395
00:26:40,801 --> 00:26:41,635
- Hi.

396
00:26:51,112 --> 00:26:53,745
(car door shuts)

397
00:26:53,747 --> 00:26:56,750
(car engine revving)

398
00:27:06,994 --> 00:27:09,730
(birds chirping)

399
00:27:19,373 --> 00:27:20,439
(car door shuts)

400
00:27:20,441 --> 00:27:23,711
(footsteps pattering)

401
00:27:47,201 --> 00:27:51,336
Yeah, it's just putting money
down on two different places

402
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:53,305
and never got that back.

403
00:27:53,307 --> 00:27:57,178
My car got fucking stolen
and shit just piled up.

404
00:27:58,946 --> 00:28:00,412
- All that time, you weren't
working?

405
00:28:00,414 --> 00:28:01,248
- I was.

406
00:28:09,123 --> 00:28:13,460
Well, how are you doing, Nance?

407
00:28:17,498 --> 00:28:18,465
- Alright.

408
00:28:20,768 --> 00:28:22,937
James told us what happened.

409
00:28:31,445 --> 00:28:32,279
Stop!

410
00:28:35,249 --> 00:28:37,316
Go on, go ahead.

411
00:28:37,318 --> 00:28:38,152
Go ahead.

412
00:28:41,922 --> 00:28:43,123
- Help yourself.

413
00:28:44,925 --> 00:28:45,993
You always do.

414
00:28:52,199 --> 00:28:57,002
- The only reason we agreed
to put you up is that boy,

415
00:28:57,004 --> 00:28:58,003
and what you did for us.

416
00:28:58,005 --> 00:28:59,438
- Don't you give her that!

417
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,372
- Do you want to do this?

418
00:29:00,374 --> 00:29:02,007
- We put a helluva lot more to
this place

419
00:29:02,009 --> 00:29:04,409
than what she gave us.

420
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:05,545
- The only reason you're here

421
00:29:05,547 --> 00:29:07,846
is James.

422
00:29:07,848 --> 00:29:10,849
But there will be none of
that shit you pulled on him.

423
00:29:10,851 --> 00:29:14,286
This is my house, you
will follow my rules.

424
00:29:14,288 --> 00:29:16,321
- Dutch, don't talk like that.

425
00:29:16,323 --> 00:29:19,927
- I ain't fucking around,
Lee, I'll put you on the curb!

426
00:29:21,395 --> 00:29:22,863
- Dutch, it's me.

427
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:39,280
What y'all doing tonight?

428
00:29:41,415 --> 00:29:43,183
- We're having a fire.

429
00:29:44,485 --> 00:29:45,817
- Would you do me favor

430
00:29:45,819 --> 00:29:48,789
and you just don't tell anyone
I'm here?

431
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:52,592
- Nance already did.

432
00:29:52,594 --> 00:29:55,260
You're welcome to join, but
you will be painting tomorrow,

433
00:29:55,262 --> 00:29:59,464
so you might wanna think
about getting some rest.

434
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:00,499
- I'm painting?

435
00:30:00,501 --> 00:30:02,535
- Yeah, yeah, to start with.

436
00:30:02,537 --> 00:30:04,936
This ain't a charity, Lee.

437
00:30:04,938 --> 00:30:06,238
We ain't them derelicts you spit
on,

438
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,174
and we ain't partying no more.

439
00:30:09,176 --> 00:30:12,210
We work, when we come
home, we work some more.

440
00:30:12,212 --> 00:30:14,379
So don't expect a repeat.

441
00:30:14,381 --> 00:30:19,318
Ain't no one taking your shit
a second time, you got it?

442
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,555
- Is that you talking or
is that Nancy talking?

443
00:30:22,557 --> 00:30:27,094
- (laughs) You know where the
door is.

444
00:30:32,466 --> 00:30:34,132
Are you fucking kidding me?

445
00:30:34,134 --> 00:30:35,067
- No.
- Man, she was a fish.

446
00:30:35,069 --> 00:30:37,035
- (indistinct) Yeah.
- You remember that?

447
00:30:37,037 --> 00:30:38,003
- Yeah.
- She could drink

448
00:30:38,005 --> 00:30:39,237
all of ya'll under the table.

449
00:30:39,239 --> 00:30:40,472
(group laughs)

450
00:30:40,474 --> 00:30:41,607
- [Man] Hell yeah.

451
00:30:41,609 --> 00:30:43,442
(Nancy laughs)

452
00:30:43,444 --> 00:30:45,545
- She just blew all that money?

453
00:30:45,547 --> 00:30:47,112
- Yeah.
- Yeah. (laughs)

454
00:30:47,114 --> 00:30:48,246
- Yeah.

455
00:30:48,248 --> 00:30:49,381
- Where's she been?

456
00:30:49,383 --> 00:30:51,249
- Well, why don't we ask her?

457
00:30:51,251 --> 00:30:52,117
- Yeah.

458
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:52,918
- [Group] Go.

459
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,188
- Leslie?
- No, don't (indistinct).

460
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:58,323
Pete, no, don't you call her
out!

461
00:30:58,325 --> 00:31:01,126
(speakers faintly speaking)

462
00:31:01,128 --> 00:31:01,962
- Leslie?

463
00:31:04,331 --> 00:31:05,165
Leslie?

464
00:31:06,367 --> 00:31:07,401
Leslie

465
00:31:08,636 --> 00:31:10,003
I know you're in there

466
00:31:18,912 --> 00:31:20,447
- That was breakfast.

467
00:31:26,621 --> 00:31:31,593
(bushes rattling)
(chain jingling)

468
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:37,097

00:31:40,702 --> 00:31:45,573

470
00:31:47,441 --> 00:31:50,377
(crickets chirping)

471
00:31:55,449 --> 00:31:56,948
(speakers faintly speaking)

472
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,518
- Oh my God, lower your fucking
voice!

473
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,418
- I don't care.

474
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,152
- She fucking hears that.

475
00:32:00,154 --> 00:32:01,687
- I can give two fucking shits!

476
00:32:01,689 --> 00:32:02,954
I hope she fucking does!

477
00:32:02,956 --> 00:32:05,490
- What do you want! You want
me to knock her around for you?

478
00:32:05,492 --> 00:32:06,659
Pop her in the mouth?

479
00:32:06,661 --> 00:32:09,327
- No, I want her out of my
fucking house!

480
00:32:09,329 --> 00:32:10,228
- Who's fucking stopping you!

481
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:13,165
- You're the one who let her in
here!

482
00:32:13,167 --> 00:32:15,100
- He called me crying, he
was begging on the phone.

483
00:32:15,102 --> 00:32:16,602
What the fuck was I supposed to
do

484
00:32:16,604 --> 00:32:19,337
- I will not be played
for a fool, not again.

485
00:32:19,339 --> 00:32:23,241
No, I will not! Don't you
walk away from me, Dutch!

486
00:32:23,243 --> 00:32:26,077
Dutch, get back here you fucking
asshole.

00:35:31,331 --> 00:35:34,602

lottery here.

538
00:35:36,269 --> 00:35:38,738
Yeah, right here in this bar.

545
00:35:57,892 --> 00:36:00,225

00:48:40,287 --> 00:48:42,956
- Oh. (laughs).

719
00:48:45,527 --> 00:48:47,627
So what have I got to do for all
this?

720
00:48:47,629 --> 00:48:50,328
- Oh, well, nothing! I mean-

721
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:51,363
- I gotta work, don't I?

722
00:48:51,365 --> 00:48:53,331
- Oh, right, yeah.

723
00:48:53,333 --> 00:48:55,167
Yeah, you gotta work.

724
00:48:55,169 --> 00:48:58,236
Basically, you got to clean up
the rooms

725
00:48:58,238 --> 00:49:03,076
after the guests leave and wash
the towels, wash the sheets,

726
00:49:03,745 --> 00:49:05,477
maintain the property a little
bit

727
00:49:05,479 --> 00:49:08,081
and help guests with their bags.

728
00:49:09,049 --> 00:49:09,684
- That it?

729
00:49:11,351 --> 00:49:14,219
- That is it, really,
pretty much it, right.

730
00:49:14,221 --> 00:49:15,721
- Okay.

731
00:49:15,723 --> 00:49:17,690
- [Sweeney] And nothing
tonight, we'll start tomorrow.

732
00:49:17,692 --> 00:49:20,125
- Okay! (laughs)

733
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:20,961
- Okay.

734
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:24,564
Royal, the other one of us,

735
00:49:24,566 --> 00:49:26,064
we're about to have supper,

736
00:49:26,066 --> 00:49:28,433
if you wanna join us,
you're more than welcome.

737
00:49:28,435 --> 00:49:30,268
- Thank you.

738
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:33,305
I think I'm gonna settle in.

739
00:49:33,307 --> 00:49:36,174
- Right, of course, I'll leave
you to it.

740
00:49:36,176 --> 00:49:37,543
- Alright. Hey?

741
00:49:37,545 --> 00:49:39,144
- Yeah.
(Leslie clears throat)

742
00:49:39,146 --> 00:49:40,479
- When do I get paid?

743
00:49:40,481 --> 00:49:44,382
- (laughs) Right, of course,
that's pretty important.

744
00:49:44,384 --> 00:49:45,587
End of the week.

745
00:49:48,088 --> 00:49:52,727
But if you needed an
advance, I could probably...

746
00:49:53,093 --> 00:49:54,594
- It would help.

747
00:49:54,596 --> 00:49:55,663
- Right, okay.

748
00:49:57,632 --> 00:49:58,700
Not a problem.

749
00:50:00,668 --> 00:50:03,068
How's 50? Is that...

750
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:04,037
- No, God.

751
00:50:07,474 --> 00:50:08,541
Thank you!

752
00:50:08,543 --> 00:50:11,679
- Okay, alright. So, great.

753
00:50:14,281 --> 00:50:15,715
Well, good night then.

754
00:50:15,717 --> 00:50:17,517
- Good night, I'll see you
tomorrow.

755
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:19,417
- Yes, you will, you will.

756
00:50:19,419 --> 00:50:22,487
Sleep well. Yeah, good night.

757
00:50:22,489 --> 00:50:25,025
(door closes)

758
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,761
(Leslie sighs)

759
00:50:28,763 --> 00:50:33,701
(Leslie snores)
(birds chirping)

760
00:50:34,134 --> 00:50:36,268
- Damn clock didn't go off.

761
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:37,737
- Hey, look, it's okay.

762
00:50:37,739 --> 00:50:39,471
You didn't know, I didn't tell
you,

763
00:50:39,473 --> 00:50:42,642
but we start at 8:00 AM around
here.

764
00:50:42,644 --> 00:50:43,543
- Good to know.

765
00:50:43,545 --> 00:50:45,243
- Alright. You know what?

766
00:50:45,245 --> 00:50:49,149
Let me get you a key so you
can get into the other rooms.

767
00:50:51,285 --> 00:50:53,385
Oh, come on, come on.

768
00:50:53,387 --> 00:50:54,286
- Thank you.
- Why don't you take that.

769
00:50:54,288 --> 00:50:55,721
- Thank you.

770
00:50:55,723 --> 00:50:58,793
Hi, Royal! You remember me?

771
00:51:00,695 --> 00:51:01,529
- (sniffles)

772
00:51:03,297 --> 00:51:04,131
I do.

773
00:51:06,333 --> 00:51:08,199
- How you doing?

774
00:51:08,201 --> 00:51:10,772
(indistinct)
Okay.

775
00:51:11,873 --> 00:51:14,707
Well, I'll get to it.

776
00:51:14,709 --> 00:51:15,575
- Okay.
- Bye.

777
00:51:15,577 --> 00:51:17,677
- If you need anything, let me
know.

778
00:51:17,679 --> 00:51:18,513
- Sure.

779
00:51:23,216 --> 00:51:25,687
(Sweeney sighs)

780
00:51:30,758 --> 00:51:35,563
- Hey, Royal, you seen a
pink suitcase about so big?

781
00:51:44,539 --> 00:51:47,542
(car engine revving)

782
00:51:58,318 --> 00:51:59,384
(door closes)
- Hey, she'll get

783
00:51:59,386 --> 00:52:01,621
the hang of it, man.

784
00:52:01,623 --> 00:52:02,888
- Cleaning the room.

785
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:04,857
Real mountain to climb.

786
00:52:04,859 --> 00:52:07,662
(car engine revs)

787
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:15,202
(soft music)
(washing machine whirring)

788
00:52:24,277 --> 00:52:26,277
- A good way is to use your
finger, okay?

789
00:52:26,279 --> 00:52:28,814
And if there's guck on it,
then you need to do it again.

790
00:52:28,816 --> 00:52:29,548
I mean, I don't wanna

791
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:31,182
be a hard-ass, Leslie-
- No.

792
00:52:31,184 --> 00:52:32,350
- But clean is clean.

793
00:52:32,352 --> 00:52:33,819
- Yeah, yeah,

794
00:52:33,821 --> 00:52:35,821
I guess I'm just getting used to

795
00:52:35,823 --> 00:52:37,422
how things work around here.

796
00:52:37,424 --> 00:52:39,692
- Yeah, we do it right
the first time around.

797
00:52:39,694 --> 00:52:40,860
- Okay, yes, sir.

798
00:52:40,862 --> 00:52:42,828
- Okay, alright then.

799
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:44,730
Well, good night.

800
00:52:44,732 --> 00:52:46,734
- Hey, hey, hey, can I...

801
00:52:48,468 --> 00:52:50,836
Could I have the other
half of that advance

802
00:52:50,838 --> 00:52:52,370
that you gave me?

803
00:52:52,372 --> 00:52:54,940
'Cause I spent the first
half on groceries, and I

804
00:52:54,942 --> 00:52:55,775
was thinking it'd be so nice

805
00:52:55,777 --> 00:52:58,811
to have some flowers for the
room.

806
00:52:58,813 --> 00:52:59,714
- Uh huh.

807
00:53:03,417 --> 00:53:04,282
There you go.

808
00:53:04,284 --> 00:53:05,851
(Leslie chuckles)

809
00:53:05,853 --> 00:53:08,623
(engine revving)

810
00:53:09,991 --> 00:53:11,389
- [Leslie] Thank you.

811
00:53:11,391 --> 00:53:12,825
- Alright.

812
00:53:12,827 --> 00:53:17,699
(crickets chirping)
(car engine revving)

813
00:53:22,537 --> 00:53:26,607
(Nancy laughs)

814
00:53:35,717 --> 00:53:37,552
- Where's Dutch, Nance?

815
00:53:38,586 --> 00:53:39,752
What, you got the balls to

816
00:53:39,754 --> 00:53:40,986
throw me out you fucking house,

817
00:53:40,988 --> 00:53:42,655
but you can't look at me?

818
00:53:42,657 --> 00:53:44,890
- Little girl, you need to look
around.

819
00:53:44,892 --> 00:53:46,625
- Little girl?

820
00:53:46,627 --> 00:53:47,895
You fucking wish.

821
00:53:50,497 --> 00:53:51,664
You don't gotta worry about me

822
00:53:51,666 --> 00:53:56,336
because despite your best
effort, I ain't going nowhere.

823
00:53:57,805 --> 00:53:58,973
I got me a job.

824
00:53:59,874 --> 00:54:03,042
I got a place to stay,
so you better watch out.

825
00:54:03,044 --> 00:54:04,677
Bang, bang.

826
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:05,845
- Y'all remember, Leslie, don't
you?

827
00:54:05,847 --> 00:54:07,980
Helen and Raymond's little girl?

828
00:54:07,982 --> 00:54:11,584
- That's right, our lucky lotto
winner!

829
00:54:11,586 --> 00:54:13,819
- You remember the Brickmans?

830
00:54:13,821 --> 00:54:15,788
Mr. and Mrs. Brickman and Warren
Parnell.

831
00:54:15,790 --> 00:54:18,824
He used to play Sunday Oregon.

832
00:54:18,826 --> 00:54:21,326
I'm sure they'd love to hear
what's going on in your life.

833
00:54:21,328 --> 00:54:23,529
Why don't you pull up a seat?

834
00:54:23,531 --> 00:54:24,632
- How are you?

835
00:54:25,767 --> 00:54:27,666
You disappeared on us.

836
00:54:27,668 --> 00:54:31,036
- Me? I'm fine.

837
00:54:31,038 --> 00:54:34,039
- And your folks? I do miss
them.

838
00:54:34,041 --> 00:54:35,941
- Yeah, they're well.

839
00:54:35,943 --> 00:54:37,879
They're down in Florida.

840
00:54:39,547 --> 00:54:42,748
- Next time you speak to 'em,
tell 'em I'm thinking of 'em.

841
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:43,751
- Oh, I will.

842
00:54:44,852 --> 00:54:45,851
- You know, Leslie,

843
00:54:45,853 --> 00:54:48,319
we still pray for you.

844
00:54:48,321 --> 00:54:50,388
No matter what's been done,

845
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:52,860
the church is still here for
you.

846
00:54:54,095 --> 00:54:55,830
I hope you know that.

847
00:55:00,868 --> 00:55:05,673
- Well, sorry for the
interruption.

848
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:12,547
And I hope you all have a
good night and God bless.

849
00:55:16,083 --> 00:55:17,450
And ya know,

850
00:55:18,786 --> 00:55:22,387
I'm just gonna be over
here enjoying myself,

851
00:55:22,389 --> 00:55:25,758
if you get tired of ole saddle
bags here.

852
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,059
- See you around, Lee.

853
00:55:27,061 --> 00:55:28,529
- Yeah, you will.

854
00:55:29,564 --> 00:55:31,096
- I apologize.

855
00:55:31,098 --> 00:55:35,937

alarm didn't go off again.

859
00:56:04,565 --> 00:56:06,497
Royal, will you tell him
my alarm didn't go off?

860
00:56:06,499 --> 00:56:08,133
I can't do nothing about that.

896
01:00:06,073 --> 01:00:08,809
(crunching gravel)
(crickets chirping)

897
01:00:40,007 --> 01:00:42,676
(Leslie knocks)

898
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:48,849
(door opens)

899
01:00:51,018 --> 01:00:51,919
Hey, buddy.

900
01:00:53,687 --> 01:00:56,054
What are you doing up and out of
bed?

901
01:00:56,056 --> 01:00:58,757
(both laugh)

902
01:00:58,759 --> 01:01:00,459
I used to live here.

903
01:01:00,461 --> 01:01:02,127
(kid laughs)

904
01:01:02,129 --> 01:01:02,963
Yeah

905
01:01:11,739 --> 01:01:14,208
(Leslie laughs)

906
01:01:22,349 --> 01:01:24,116
- Can I help you?

907
01:01:24,118 --> 01:01:25,853
(Leslie laughs)

908
01:01:28,222 --> 01:01:29,454
Do I need to walk you out?

909
01:01:29,456 --> 01:01:30,758
- No, no.

910
01:01:37,031 --> 01:01:39,466
God, this was a good house.

911
01:01:40,868 --> 01:01:42,803
I used to cook and clean.

912
01:01:44,838 --> 01:01:47,841
I used to cook and clean
(laughs).

913
01:01:53,847 --> 01:01:58,285
And Christmas, we used to have
a just wonderful Christmas.

914
01:02:00,354 --> 01:02:03,390
We used to put the tree
there in that corner.

915
01:02:05,993 --> 01:02:08,495
Is that where you put your tree?

916
01:02:10,164 --> 01:02:13,065
- Is there somebody that
you need me to call?

917
01:02:13,067 --> 01:02:13,901
- No.

918
01:02:17,137 --> 01:02:21,742
- Ma'am, is there somebody
that you need me to call?

919
01:02:25,879 --> 01:02:28,882
(car engine revving)

920
01:02:34,255 --> 01:02:36,991
(car door opens)

921
01:02:39,493 --> 01:02:42,296

922
01:02:50,505 --> 01:02:53,005

923
01:02:53,007 --> 01:02:55,173

924
01:02:55,175 --> 01:02:57,309

925
01:02:57,311 --> 01:03:00,447
(soft music continues)

926
01:03:07,454 --> 01:03:10,090
(Leslie sighs)

927
01:03:23,270 --> 01:03:25,904
(Leslie cries)

928
01:03:25,906 --> 01:03:28,375
(keys jingling)

929
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:42,590
(door closes)

930
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:02,009
(Leslie sniffs)

931
01:05:11,311 --> 01:05:13,080
(Leslie coughs)

932
01:05:14,516 --> 01:05:18,049
(birds chirping)
(Sweeney knocks)

933
01:05:18,051 --> 01:05:19,119
- Hey, Leslie.

934
01:05:20,454 --> 01:05:23,121
Listen, I'm sorry it didn't work
out.

935
01:05:23,123 --> 01:05:26,324
(Sweeney knocks)

936
01:05:26,326 --> 01:05:30,328
You can just take what I gave
you for the time you put in.

937
01:05:30,330 --> 01:05:31,631
(Sweeney knocks)

938
01:05:31,633 --> 01:05:32,466
Leslie?

939
01:05:33,601 --> 01:05:35,467
- I don't think she in there.

940
01:05:35,469 --> 01:05:40,340
(Sweeney knocks)
(Sweeney sighs)

941
01:05:41,475 --> 01:05:42,943
(door closes)

942
01:05:44,344 --> 01:05:47,281
- Hey, Leslie, I need to talk to
you.

943
01:05:49,483 --> 01:05:50,317
Come on.

944
01:05:56,990 --> 01:05:59,460
(Sweeney sighs)

945
01:06:11,739 --> 01:06:12,707
- I'm sorry.

946
01:06:15,442 --> 01:06:17,144
I haven't been myself late-.

947
01:06:19,012 --> 01:06:20,380
for a long time

948
01:06:21,616 --> 01:06:26,017
And this is a good job, I
understand that.

949
01:06:26,019 --> 01:06:28,121
And I messed up, I'm sorry.

950
01:06:30,357 --> 01:06:33,225
- If you got people,
I can take you to 'em.

951
01:06:33,227 --> 01:06:34,159
- If I had,

952
01:06:34,161 --> 01:06:35,329
I'da called 'em last night.

953
01:06:36,363 --> 01:06:38,096
- I might look stupid to you
but-

954
01:06:38,098 --> 01:06:39,799
- You don't.

955
01:06:39,801 --> 01:06:42,668
- Yeah, well, I ain't one for
letting people get over on me.

956
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:45,205
- You could've fooled me there.

957
01:06:49,276 --> 01:06:50,442
Look, it might not be obvious to
you,

958
01:06:50,444 --> 01:06:54,214
but I'm asking to stay.

959
01:07:06,628 --> 01:07:11,263
- When you finish that,
go check in with Royal.

960
01:07:11,265 --> 01:07:15,302
There's some crap behind
16, he needs help sorting.

961
01:07:30,150 --> 01:07:33,853

(Royal howls)
(Sweeney chuckles)

968
01:08:37,585 --> 01:08:40,586
- Royal. We like to keep him
around.

969
01:08:40,588 --> 01:08:45,392
Something for the kids to
poke a stick at. (laughs)

970
01:08:48,863 --> 01:08:50,330
How long you been drinking?

971
01:08:52,432 --> 01:08:54,736
Okay, mind my business?

972
01:08:56,604 --> 01:08:57,471
Sure thing.

973
01:09:09,349 --> 01:09:13,385
Royal, that's not even the
weirdest thing he does.

974
01:09:13,387 --> 01:09:14,787
You'll see in time.

975
01:09:14,789 --> 01:09:15,688
You'll see for yourself.

976
01:09:15,690 --> 01:09:18,924
He'll get butt-naked and run
that field

977
01:09:18,926 --> 01:09:21,192
just screaming like a damn wild
man.

978
01:09:21,194 --> 01:09:24,697
(laughs) It's crazy, man!

979
01:09:24,699 --> 01:09:29,537
He'll just go, just running
naked, crazy!

980
01:09:30,138 --> 01:09:31,837
You wait till you'll see it.

981
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:35,608
Oh, man, the cops don't even
bother with him anymore.

982
01:09:35,610 --> 01:09:37,843
He does it so damn much.

983
01:09:37,845 --> 01:09:39,547
Crazy son of a bitch.

984
01:09:41,983 --> 01:09:43,849
You know...

985
01:09:43,851 --> 01:09:47,955
quitting cold turkey, it's a
good way to shock your system.

986
01:09:51,224 --> 01:09:54,361
- Well, I don't got a choice.

987
01:09:55,897 --> 01:09:57,932
- Someone making you quit?

988
01:10:03,871 --> 01:10:06,237
(Royal howls)

989
01:10:06,239 --> 01:10:09,775
Alright, well, you don't
seem like you wanna talk

990
01:10:09,777 --> 01:10:12,477
and that's okay,
(Royal howls)

991
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:14,412
but we're trying to eat dinner
here

992
01:10:14,414 --> 01:10:15,413
and I don't wanna listen to
that.

993
01:10:15,415 --> 01:10:19,484
So is there some music
you'd like me to put on?

994
01:10:19,486 --> 01:10:20,621
- You can pick.

995
01:10:21,956 --> 01:10:25,891
- Okay, why don't we just play

996
01:10:25,893 --> 01:10:28,495
whatever Royal's got on there?

997
01:10:31,866 --> 01:10:33,298
Just let ol'

998
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:34,902

anything?

I can bring you something to
eat.

1033

break?

yelling at me.

Three and four.

1048
01:13:10,825 --> 01:13:13,692

1049
01:13:13,694 --> 01:13:17,162
and roast turkey breast and
stuffing.

1050

What would you like to eat?

1051

would you like that cooked?

1053
01:13:25,806 --> 01:13:28,576

Okay.

1058
01:13:54,201 --> 01:13:55,801

I think you'd better leave.

wanna talk about that with you.

1074
01:15:03,304 --> 01:15:04,937
But thank you for the pills.

1075
01:15:04,939 --> 01:15:06,805
- That was Royal's idea.

1076
01:15:06,807 --> 01:15:09,243
- Well, I'll thank him tomorrow.

1077
01:15:11,178 --> 01:15:12,911
Couldn't sleep, huh?

1078
01:15:12,913 --> 01:15:17,049
- Nope, and I wanted to tell you

1079
01:15:17,051 --> 01:15:19,651
that you're doing good work.

1080
01:15:19,653 --> 01:15:22,823
The place looks real clean
and the guests are real happy.

1081
01:15:24,592 --> 01:15:27,326
- Thank the Lord, I did it. I'm
a maid.

1082
01:15:27,328 --> 01:15:30,295
(Sweeney laughs)

1083
01:15:30,297 --> 01:15:33,198
- Yeah, so when Royal's daddy
died

1084
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:36,835
and left him the place, I
was already staying here.

1085
01:15:36,837 --> 01:15:39,738
So he asked me if I would help
him run it.

1086
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:41,974
- Wait, this is Royal's motel?

1087
01:15:41,976 --> 01:15:43,575
- It is.

1088
01:15:43,577 --> 01:15:45,711
Didn't you grow up together?

1089
01:15:45,713 --> 01:15:48,280
- Damn, we ain't run in the same
circles.

1090
01:15:48,282 --> 01:15:49,348
- Well, that's probably better
off,

1091
01:15:49,350 --> 01:15:51,650
'cause somehow he did so much
LSD

1092
01:15:51,652 --> 01:15:54,153
that it permanently rewired his
brain.

1093
01:15:54,155 --> 01:15:56,255
(Leslie laughs)
I'm serious.

1094
01:15:56,257 --> 01:15:58,993
I mean, he can function, but
man,

1095
01:16:00,061 --> 01:16:02,963
you ask him to remember to pay a
bill?

1096
01:16:04,198 --> 01:16:06,934
So, I get a room and a small
wage.

1097
01:16:08,602 --> 01:16:11,070
- And what'd you do before this?

1098
01:16:11,072 --> 01:16:12,640
- I never did much.

1099
01:16:14,308 --> 01:16:18,345
I worked the oil field and got
divorced.

1100
01:16:19,713 --> 01:16:21,080
So run a motel?

1101
01:16:21,082 --> 01:16:22,848
Sure, I'll do it.

1102
01:16:22,850 --> 01:16:26,385
- And that picture you
keep, is that your ex-wife?

1103
01:16:26,387 --> 01:16:29,221
- No, that is my daughter,
Bernice and her baby.

1104
01:16:29,223 --> 01:16:32,026
(Leslie chuckles)

1105
01:16:34,028 --> 01:16:36,261
- Did you leave them?

1106
01:16:36,263 --> 01:16:38,030
- No, I left my wife.

1107
01:16:38,032 --> 01:16:39,798
I see them as much as possible.

1108
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:42,367
They live about an hour away
from here.

1109
01:16:42,369 --> 01:16:44,738
- Just didn't work out, huh?

1110
01:16:46,373 --> 01:16:48,242
- Well, she drank.

1111
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:54,381
And she beat the drinking.

1112
01:16:56,851 --> 01:17:01,687
And the church that helped
her, I did not care for.

1113
01:17:01,689 --> 01:17:05,057
And she liked the church
and like the pastor more.

1114
01:17:05,059 --> 01:17:07,392
- No (chuckles).
- Yes (chuckles).

1115
01:17:07,394 --> 01:17:09,128
Preacher stole my wife.

1116
01:17:09,130 --> 01:17:10,762
- That's a gold record right
there.

1117
01:17:10,764 --> 01:17:11,964
- You think Willie would sing
it?

1118
01:17:11,966 --> 01:17:12,965
- I think he sang about it.

1119
01:17:12,967 --> 01:17:16,103
- (laughs) Yeah, I think he did.

1120
01:17:18,172 --> 01:17:19,406
- And your girl?

1121
01:17:20,441 --> 01:17:21,642
- A good kid.

1122
01:17:23,077 --> 01:17:26,178
Had troubles with men, like
y'all do,

1123
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:28,782
but she turned out good, though.

1124
01:17:31,085 --> 01:17:32,918
Hey, I didn't mean nothing

1125
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:36,355
by saying her drinking led to
our divorce.

1126
01:17:36,357 --> 01:17:38,790
It did, but she ain't you

1127
01:17:38,792 --> 01:17:42,194
and things don't go the
same way for any two people.

1128
01:17:42,196 --> 01:17:45,130
And I don't think any less of
you

1129
01:17:45,132 --> 01:17:47,701
for having the problems you do.

1130
01:17:56,710 --> 01:18:01,713
So, hey, I wanted to ask you

1131
01:18:01,715 --> 01:18:05,751
if you wanted to join
me and Royal at a dance.

1132
01:18:05,753 --> 01:18:07,486
- Now you don't wanna ask me no
more?

1133
01:18:07,488 --> 01:18:12,393
- No, I am, I'm asking
you, but it's a town thing.

1134
01:18:12,661 --> 01:18:14,493
It's-
- A town thing?

1135
01:18:14,495 --> 01:18:16,094
- Yeah, right.

1136
01:18:16,096 --> 01:18:18,732
Meaning, everyone will be there.

1137
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:21,302
The whole town and...

1138
01:18:22,937 --> 01:18:24,205
- Oh,

1139
01:18:27,808 --> 01:18:28,842
Yeah, no thank you.

1140
01:18:30,010 --> 01:18:34,949
- I'm just saying that it's your
home too.

1141
01:18:35,282 --> 01:18:37,249
And if you're planning on doing
something

1142
01:18:37,251 --> 01:18:41,453
other than eating TV dinners
with me and the space cadet,

1143
01:18:41,455 --> 01:18:44,391
maybe you oughta venture out a
bit.

1144
01:18:45,392 --> 01:18:47,294
That's all I'm thinking.

1145
01:18:56,370 --> 01:18:59,039
(country music)

1146
01:19:01,842 --> 01:19:04,378
(people cheering)
(food sizzling)

1147
01:19:25,232 --> 01:19:27,901
(country music)

1148
01:19:36,243 --> 01:19:37,209
- Paw-paw!

1149
01:19:37,211 --> 01:19:39,444
- Oh, who's that yelling at me?

1150
01:19:39,446 --> 01:19:42,114
Hey, Betsey-girl, how you doing?

1151
01:19:42,116 --> 01:19:43,482
- Mom said we can play games.

1152
01:19:43,484 --> 01:19:45,017
- Oh, she did, did she?

1153
01:19:45,019 --> 01:19:45,984
- (laughs) Hey, dad.

1154
01:19:45,986 --> 01:19:47,819
- Hey, how you doing? Is your
mom coming?

1155
01:19:47,821 --> 01:19:49,388
- No, it's Sunday.

1156
01:19:49,390 --> 01:19:51,290
Lord forbid she have some
fun with her granddaughter.

1157
01:19:51,292 --> 01:19:53,158
- That's okay, more for me!

1158
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:55,595
- (laughs) I told Betsey
you'd play games with her.

1159
01:19:55,597 --> 01:19:56,428
- Where are you going?

1160
01:19:56,430 --> 01:19:57,329
- Nowhere.

1161
01:19:57,331 --> 01:19:58,230
- Well, good.

1162
01:19:58,232 --> 01:20:00,399
Hey Bernice, this is Leslie.

1163
01:20:00,401 --> 01:20:02,167
Royal hired her on at the hotel,
to host.

1164
01:20:02,169 --> 01:20:03,902
Leslie, this is my daughter,
Bernice,

1165
01:20:03,904 --> 01:20:06,038
and this little dream
here, this is Betsey.

1166
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:08,541
- Hi.
- Hi! (laughs)

1167
01:20:08,543 --> 01:20:10,108
Well, pleasure to know you both.

1168
01:20:10,110 --> 01:20:11,043
- It's nice to meet you.

1169
01:20:11,045 --> 01:20:11,778
- Wanna get cracking?

1170
01:20:11,780 --> 01:20:14,012
- Yeah.
- Alright, let's go.

1171
01:20:14,014 --> 01:20:16,014
(upbeat music)

1172
01:20:16,016 --> 01:20:18,150
- Are you from around here?

1173
01:20:18,152 --> 01:20:21,386
- Yep, born and raised. (laughs)

1174
01:20:21,388 --> 01:20:22,555
And what about you?

1175
01:20:22,557 --> 01:20:24,222
- We're just outside of Abilene.

1176
01:20:24,224 --> 01:20:26,226
- Ah, yeah, it's nice.

1177
01:20:27,328 --> 01:20:28,395
- Not too bad.

1178
01:20:30,632 --> 01:20:32,164
- Yeah, I'm winning.

1179
01:20:32,166 --> 01:20:33,432
(indistinct)
- I'm winning.

1180
01:20:33,434 --> 01:20:34,266
- I'm winning.

1181
01:20:34,268 --> 01:20:35,102
- Oh, no.

1182
01:20:36,937 --> 01:20:39,340
(upbeat music)

1183
01:20:44,244 --> 01:20:45,410
- [Kid] Oh, yeah.

1184
01:20:45,412 --> 01:20:46,246
- Man.

1185
01:20:48,415 --> 01:20:50,516
- It's nice.
- Your girls are great.

1186
01:20:50,518 --> 01:20:51,483
- I did alright, huh?

1187
01:20:51,485 --> 01:20:53,285
- Yes, you did.

1188
01:20:53,287 --> 01:20:56,488
(Leslie cheers)

1189
01:20:56,490 --> 01:20:57,989
- You cheated.
- Yeah, they are cheaters.

1190
01:20:57,991 --> 01:21:00,025
- Hey, I didn't cheat.
- Come on.

1191
01:21:00,027 --> 01:21:00,892
- Come on.
- Come on.

1192
01:21:00,894 --> 01:21:01,527
Let's go to the next game.

1193
01:21:01,529 --> 01:21:02,894
What is this?

1194
01:21:02,896 --> 01:21:05,263
- Hey, Betsey, look what Leslie
got ya.

1195
01:21:05,265 --> 01:21:06,298
- Can you catch?

1196
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:08,135
- Yeah.
- Can you catch?

1197
01:21:09,937 --> 01:21:10,536
- [Bernice And Leslie] Oh!

1198
01:21:10,538 --> 01:21:11,470
- What was that?

1199
01:21:11,472 --> 01:21:12,471
- Shit!
- What was that?

1200
01:21:12,473 --> 01:21:13,905
(Leslie laughs)

1201
01:21:13,907 --> 01:21:15,273
- Here you go.
- Thanks there, Dutch.

1202
01:21:15,275 --> 01:21:16,975
- Sweeney, how are ya?

1203
01:21:16,977 --> 01:21:19,612
- Just hanging out with my
girls. And you?

1204
01:21:19,614 --> 01:21:21,081
- Can't complain.

1205
01:21:22,249 --> 01:21:23,083
Lee.

1206
01:21:24,284 --> 01:21:25,285
- Hey, Dutch.

1207
01:21:34,094 --> 01:21:36,497

- The shovels of shit
her mama made him eat

1214
01:22:02,990 --> 01:22:05,558
just to be there for his kid.

1215
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:07,562
- He deserves a medal, huh?

1216
01:22:08,962 --> 01:22:11,029
- Men ain't what they was.

1217
01:22:11,031 --> 01:22:13,198
My daddy worked whole
life to give us a roof.

1218
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:14,266
He had eight fingers.

1219
01:22:14,268 --> 01:22:17,369
(Leslie laughs)

1220
01:22:17,371 --> 01:22:19,674
- Well, mine had 10, but he
worked.

1221
01:22:21,208 --> 01:22:22,441
- Now everyone thinks
they should be living

1222
01:22:22,443 --> 01:22:24,677
some life out the movies.

1223
01:22:24,679 --> 01:22:27,979
Life is hard, stop acting like
it ain't.

1224
01:22:27,981 --> 01:22:30,449
Just do what you gotta
and don't hurt no one.

1225
01:22:30,451 --> 01:22:33,053
(upbeat music)

1226
01:22:35,289 --> 01:22:38,492
What do you think about the moon
landing?

1227
01:22:39,527 --> 01:22:40,492
- What?

1228
01:22:40,494 --> 01:22:43,161
- We only went there one time.

1229
01:22:43,163 --> 01:22:45,633
- (laughs) Hey.

1230
01:22:48,435 --> 01:22:50,368
- You wanna take a picture,
it'll lasts longer.

1231
01:22:50,370 --> 01:22:53,238
- Is it true you won the
lottery?

1232
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:55,140
- Yes, I did.

1233
01:22:55,142 --> 01:22:58,045
- What did you do with all the
money?

1234
01:22:59,012 --> 01:23:01,012
- I bought a pettin' zoo.

1235
01:23:01,014 --> 01:23:03,551
- I heard you put it up your
nose.

1236
01:23:07,187 --> 01:23:09,557
- Is it true you won the
lottery?

1237
01:23:12,292 --> 01:23:15,193
- Someone tell you to come say
that?

1238
01:23:15,195 --> 01:23:16,161
- Get outta here.

1239
01:23:16,163 --> 01:23:18,365
Before I tell your mama what
you're doing.

1240
01:23:21,502 --> 01:23:23,134
Pete's girl.

1241
01:23:23,136 --> 01:23:23,771
- Yeah?

1242
01:23:25,038 --> 01:23:26,741
- Hey, you wanna dance?

1243
01:23:28,776 --> 01:23:31,042
- I think I'm gonna go.

1244
01:23:31,044 --> 01:23:32,143
But thank you for a nice day.

1245
01:23:32,145 --> 01:23:33,779

1246
01:23:33,781 --> 01:23:35,515

1250
01:23:42,422 --> 01:23:43,390
Let's dance.

1251
01:23:45,092 --> 01:23:48,761

song.

1252
01:23:48,763 --> 01:23:49,631

- What? Dancing with you?

1260
01:24:15,590 --> 01:24:18,824
We ain't done it long enough

Whoa! (laughs)

1262
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:22,260

01:24:22,262 --> 01:24:23,461
- Alright.

1264
01:24:23,463 --> 01:24:25,767

1265
01:24:26,801 --> 01:24:29,369

(crowd cheering)

1273
01:24:47,855 --> 01:24:49,454
- [Nancy] What you gonna
do with all that money?

1274
01:24:49,456 --> 01:24:51,691
- I'ma drink my ass off with
half of it

1275
01:24:51,693 --> 01:24:53,491

1277
01:24:54,896 --> 01:24:56,428

1278
01:24:56,430 --> 01:24:58,363
- [Pete] Kids? I got drinks to
drink!

1279
01:24:58,365 --> 01:25:00,733
- Come on, I'll come
with you. (Pete cheers)

1280
01:25:00,735 --> 01:25:02,133
- That's good, Pete.

1281
01:25:02,135 --> 01:25:04,904
(claps) Real good.

1282
01:25:04,906 --> 01:25:07,607
- This bitch is clapping!

1283
01:25:07,609 --> 01:25:08,874
- Yeah, I don't know what
you're talking about, Les.

1284
01:25:08,876 --> 01:25:11,176
See, I just won the lottery.

1285
01:25:11,178 --> 01:25:12,845
Not everything's about you.

1286
01:25:12,847 --> 01:25:15,748
- You did? What you
gonna do with the money?

1287
01:25:15,750 --> 01:25:17,583
- I'll figure something, don't
you worry.

1288
01:25:17,585 --> 01:25:18,784
- I just wanna make
sure you don't waste it

1289
01:25:18,786 --> 01:25:21,621
like you wasted your goddamn
life.

1290
01:25:21,623 --> 01:25:23,723
- Oh, you got jokes, huh?

1291
01:25:23,725 --> 01:25:26,659
You blew 180,000, you dumb
bitch.

1292
01:25:26,661 --> 01:25:30,696
- 190, and it ain't that much.

1293
01:25:30,698 --> 01:25:31,664
And what about you, Pete?

1294
01:25:31,666 --> 01:25:33,532
When I first met you, you were
fucking 18.

1295
01:25:33,534 --> 01:25:35,935
You were ready to see the world.

1296
01:25:35,937 --> 01:25:38,403
Look at you now.

1297
01:25:38,405 --> 01:25:42,844
You could've did anything,
Pete, but you fucking did this.

1298
01:25:44,879 --> 01:25:46,912
So don't give me your shit.

1299
01:25:46,914 --> 01:25:48,547
- Hey, hey, why don't we all
just go back

1300
01:25:48,549 --> 01:25:49,414
to having a good time?

1301
01:25:49,416 --> 01:25:50,583
Huh? Come on.

1302
01:25:50,585 --> 01:25:52,317
- You know what she did,
Sweeney?

1303
01:25:52,319 --> 01:25:53,451
- It's not my business,

1304
01:25:53,453 --> 01:25:54,452
it's not yours to be doing this
here.

1305
01:25:54,454 --> 01:25:55,788
I mean, have some sense,
alright?

1306
01:25:55,790 --> 01:25:58,256
I mean, we're having fun.

1307
01:25:58,258 --> 01:26:01,694
- You oughta know if you're
gonna be laying down with her.

1308
01:26:01,696 --> 01:26:02,728
- Where's Dutch?

1309
01:26:02,730 --> 01:26:03,829
Someone needs to take her home.

1310
01:26:03,831 --> 01:26:06,199
- You know she left her kid?

1311
01:26:08,301 --> 01:26:09,802
- He don't know anything.
- Hey.

1312
01:26:09,804 --> 01:26:11,336
- Hey, hey, hey, no, no,
don't get mad at Royal.

1313
01:26:11,338 --> 01:26:13,238
He's just trying to help you
out.

1314
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:15,407
Did she tell you she
drank all that money away?

1315
01:26:15,409 --> 01:26:17,409
Had every chance, pissed
it down the gutter,

1316
01:26:17,411 --> 01:26:18,110
and her son-
- Nancy.

1317
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:19,912
- Left him, no note, nothing.

1318
01:26:19,914 --> 01:26:21,747
That boy was 13.

1319
01:26:21,749 --> 01:26:23,716
Ain't have food, he's just
scared.

1320
01:26:23,718 --> 01:26:25,618
He's all alone without his mama.

1321
01:26:25,620 --> 01:26:28,386
Just so you could go out
drinking,
thinking you're hot shit.

1322
01:26:28,388 --> 01:26:29,320
- That ain't fucking true.

1323
01:26:29,322 --> 01:26:31,289
- Good Christian people raised
you right.

1324
01:26:31,291 --> 01:26:33,358
And you ruined that sweet boy's
life.

1325
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:36,261
- And what did you do to fucking
stop me?!

1326
01:26:36,263 --> 01:26:39,732
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you! Fuck you!

1327
01:26:39,734 --> 01:26:41,903
- Get her outta here. Bitch.

1328
01:26:48,876 --> 01:26:50,876
- Hey, hey, was all that true?

1329
01:26:50,878 --> 01:26:52,912
- So what? You wanna fire me?

1330
01:26:52,914 --> 01:26:54,580
- Leslie.

1331
01:26:54,582 --> 01:26:55,480
- I don't blame you.

1332
01:26:55,482 --> 01:26:56,347
It's fine. You tried.

1333
01:26:56,349 --> 01:26:57,516
- Just stop.
- I don't blame anyone.

1334
01:26:57,518 --> 01:26:58,853
- Just stop.
- Why?

1335
01:27:00,253 --> 01:27:01,620
I was happy to have a break.

1336
01:27:01,622 --> 01:27:06,025
Okay, I partied and I
didn't mean to spend it all.

1337
01:27:06,027 --> 01:27:08,661
I lost everything and I
had to file for bankruptcy.

1338
01:27:08,663 --> 01:27:10,295
- Okay.
- Fucking everyone hated me.

1339
01:27:10,297 --> 01:27:11,764
I lost my place.

1340
01:27:11,766 --> 01:27:14,567
And so yeah, I left him.

1341
01:27:14,569 --> 01:27:15,568
- [Sweeney] Okay.

1342
01:27:15,570 --> 01:27:16,902
- I left him.

1343
01:27:16,904 --> 01:27:20,271
- Okay, let me just say
bye and I'll drive you.

1344
01:27:20,273 --> 01:27:21,339
[Sweeney] Yeah.

1345
01:27:21,341 --> 01:27:23,878
- Hey, it's fine.

1346
01:27:24,879 --> 01:27:29,550
- Just, I don't think you
should be alone, Leslie.

1347
01:27:31,786 --> 01:27:34,454
(country music)

1348
01:27:37,491 --> 01:27:39,326
(dial tone)

1349
01:27:48,669 --> 01:27:51,338
(phone beeping)

1350
01:28:13,795 --> 01:28:16,764
(car engine revving)

1351
01:28:26,808 --> 01:28:27,640
- What's that?

1352
01:28:27,642 --> 01:28:30,876
- Do you mind if I lift your
spirits?

1353
01:28:30,878 --> 01:28:33,378
Got a buddy who works down at
the station,

1354
01:28:33,380 --> 01:28:35,016
and he dug this up for me.

1355
01:28:37,417 --> 01:28:38,684
- [Newsman] And it was
here at Obe's honky ton-

1356
01:28:38,686 --> 01:28:39,752
- Look at you.

1357
01:28:39,754 --> 01:28:41,887
- That a single mother
picked the winning numbers

1358
01:28:41,889 --> 01:28:44,455
which after taxes, will
be sending her home

1359
01:28:44,457 --> 01:28:45,825
with a life-changing sum of
money.

1360
01:28:45,827 --> 01:28:48,994
- Whoa, whoa! Whoa!

1361
01:28:48,996 --> 01:28:51,096
- Leslie, how does it feel?
(Sweeney laughs)

1362
01:28:51,098 --> 01:28:54,432
- Well, I feel helluvalot
better than yesterday. (laughs)

1363
01:28:54,434 --> 01:28:56,068
- I understand that you had a
little help

1364
01:28:56,070 --> 01:28:56,936
picking the winning numbers?

1365
01:28:56,938 --> 01:28:59,104
- I picked the same ones I
always do.

1366
01:28:59,106 --> 01:29:00,405
- [Newsman] And that
was your son's birthday?

1367
01:29:00,407 --> 01:29:01,640
- Yeah, James, my son James.

1368
01:29:01,642 --> 01:29:02,541
You wanna meet him?

1369
01:29:02,543 --> 01:29:03,374
- [Newsman] Sure.
- Okay.

1370
01:29:03,376 --> 01:29:05,044
James! Come here.

1371
01:29:05,046 --> 01:29:06,545
This is my boy.

1372
01:29:06,547 --> 01:29:08,647
Yeah, he's twice as lucky, half
as cute.

1373
01:29:08,649 --> 01:29:09,480
- [Newsman] And what do you plan
to do

1374
01:29:09,482 --> 01:29:11,917
with 190,000 smackeroos?

1375
01:29:11,919 --> 01:29:12,985
- God, I don't know.

1376
01:29:12,987 --> 01:29:17,056
Maybe by a house, buy
something nice for my boy.

1377
01:29:17,058 --> 01:29:18,824
Just have a better life!

1378
01:29:18,826 --> 01:29:19,758
- [Nancy] Hey, Lee, what about
us?

1379
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:20,860
- [Friends] What about us?

1380
01:29:20,862 --> 01:29:22,460
- Drinks are on me!

1381
01:29:22,462 --> 01:29:24,763
(crowd cheers)

1382
01:29:24,765 --> 01:29:26,665
- [Newsman] And you James,
is there something special

1383
01:29:26,667 --> 01:29:28,100
that momma owes you now?

1384
01:29:28,102 --> 01:29:29,969
- What? Being born ain't enough?

1385
01:29:29,971 --> 01:29:32,137
- A guitar, so I can be the next
Waylon.

1386
01:29:32,139 --> 01:29:33,839
- [Friends] Oh, yeah.

1387
01:29:33,841 --> 01:29:36,041
(Leslie cheers)

1388
01:29:36,043 --> 01:29:38,544
- And I want her to open a
diner.

1389
01:29:38,546 --> 01:29:39,745
She always wanted a diner.

1390
01:29:39,747 --> 01:29:42,014
- Hey, well, would you call it
Leslie's?

1391
01:29:42,016 --> 01:29:43,549
(Leslie scoffs)

1392
01:29:43,551 --> 01:29:45,651
Well, I hope to be there on
opening day.

1393
01:29:45,653 --> 01:29:49,622
- Well, we're looking
forward to ya. (cheers)

1394
01:29:49,624 --> 01:29:52,758
- Alright, well, from all
of us at Channel 10 News;

1395
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:54,026
here's to Leslie!

1396
01:29:54,028 --> 01:29:56,128
We wish you all the best.

1397
01:29:56,130 --> 01:29:58,165
(Leslie cheers)

1398
01:30:00,534 --> 01:30:01,901
- Oh, I'm gonna watch that
again, you look so good!

1399
01:30:01,903 --> 01:30:03,669
- No, no.

1400
01:30:03,671 --> 01:30:05,204
- Just gonna rewind it.

1401
01:30:05,206 --> 01:30:08,540
- I said I don't wanna
watch it again, goddammit.

1402
01:30:08,542 --> 01:30:10,042
I said no, if you just
listened the first time,

1403
01:30:10,044 --> 01:30:12,912
then you wouldn't get your
feelings hurt.

1404
01:30:12,914 --> 01:30:14,414
- I just thought it'd be nice
to...

1405
01:30:17,151 --> 01:30:19,084
- Get out.

1406
01:30:19,086 --> 01:30:20,052
- Hey, come on, I just
thought it'd be nice

1407
01:30:20,054 --> 01:30:22,888
if we watch it together just to
remind you

1408
01:30:22,890 --> 01:30:24,590
that you're not the piece of
shit

1409
01:30:24,592 --> 01:30:26,191
that everybody says you are.

1410
01:30:26,193 --> 01:30:29,762
Right, what I saw was a
good mama loving on her boy,

1411
01:30:29,764 --> 01:30:31,230
but I guess I wasn't thinking.

1412
01:30:31,232 --> 01:30:33,666
- No, you weren't thinking.

1413
01:30:33,668 --> 01:30:37,836
You're shoving your way into
my life and you know what?

1414
01:30:37,838 --> 01:30:40,808
It's my life.

1415
01:30:42,977 --> 01:30:45,811
Jesus Christ, this fucking week!

1416
01:30:45,813 --> 01:30:47,246
- Well, I'm sorry I got
the fucking tape thing.

1417
01:30:47,248 --> 01:30:49,884
- Don't you fucking swear at me!

1418
01:31:01,929 --> 01:31:02,763
He --

1419
01:31:04,031 --> 01:31:06,701
He ain't never gonna speak to me
again.

1420
01:31:08,769 --> 01:31:10,803
My folks don't wanna fucking
speak to me,

1421
01:31:10,805 --> 01:31:15,643
and everyone in town tries
to avoid me like the plague,

1422
01:31:16,143 --> 01:31:20,179
and my boy doesn't wanna see me.

1423
01:31:20,181 --> 01:31:22,781
And I'm fucking stuck
here with you and Royal,

1424
01:31:22,783 --> 01:31:27,186
pair of fucking hilljacks
like the shit icing

1425
01:31:27,188 --> 01:31:28,954
on my shit fucking life.

1426
01:31:28,956 --> 01:31:30,689
Ya know?

1427
01:31:30,691 --> 01:31:32,591
- Me and Royal are the best
thing that happened to you.

1428
01:31:32,593 --> 01:31:34,228
So don't call us names.

1429
01:31:35,696 --> 01:31:37,162
And your family won't talk to
you

1430
01:31:37,164 --> 01:31:41,000
because they shouldn't after
what you did.

1431
01:31:41,002 --> 01:31:42,970
But you're living, right?

1432
01:31:44,839 --> 01:31:45,771
(Leslie laughs)

1433
01:31:45,773 --> 01:31:48,273
I'm sorry it ain't a fairy tale.

1434
01:31:48,275 --> 01:31:50,175
We all should have done
things differently.

1435
01:31:50,177 --> 01:31:54,715
But you're what's wrong with
your life, not anyone else.

1436
01:32:00,187 --> 01:32:01,088
- Fuck you.

1437
01:32:02,757 --> 01:32:03,591
- Okay

1438
01:32:05,259 --> 01:32:07,960
Alright, just sit down, Leslie.

1439
01:32:07,962 --> 01:32:09,628
Fuck you.

1440
01:32:09,630 --> 01:32:12,166
Come on, let's just talk about
it.

1441
01:32:14,602 --> 01:32:16,602
Where are you gonna go?
What are you gonna do?

1442
01:32:16,604 --> 01:32:18,103
I know where you're gonna go.

1443
01:32:18,105 --> 01:32:19,671
And everything you did to get
better

1444
01:32:19,673 --> 01:32:21,242
is just gonna be gone.

1445
01:32:22,576 --> 01:32:25,012
- Well, it ain't you're concern.

1446
01:32:28,215 --> 01:32:29,984
'Cause I fucking quit!

1447
01:32:45,666 --> 01:32:47,568
(coin into slot)

1448
01:32:50,204 --> 01:32:52,139
(touchtones)

1449
01:32:57,812 --> 01:33:00,314
(phone ringing)

1450
01:33:05,786 --> 01:33:07,619
- [Operator] Hello, no one is
available

1451
01:33:07,621 --> 01:33:09,221
to take your call at this time.

1452
01:33:09,223 --> 01:33:11,123
Please leave a message after the
tone.

1453
01:33:11,125 --> 01:33:13,025
(phone beeps)

1454
01:33:13,027 --> 01:33:14,295
- James, it's me.

1455
01:33:19,266 --> 01:33:22,868
I'm so sorry for what I did to
you.

1456
01:33:22,870 --> 01:33:25,172
I love you so much, and uh...

1457
01:33:34,248 --> 01:33:36,083
I love you sweetie.

1458
01:33:59,206 --> 01:34:01,876
(country music)

1459
01:34:11,185 --> 01:34:13,654
(latin music)

1460
01:34:25,332 --> 01:34:27,968
(rock music)

1461
01:34:34,808 --> 01:34:37,278
(country music)

1462
01:34:47,188 --> 01:34:48,022
How much?

1463
01:34:49,456 --> 01:34:53,027
- [Bert] Seven, but for
you we'll say seven.

1464
01:35:01,769 --> 01:35:04,872
- I think drinking alone's a
mortal sin.

1465
01:35:09,410 --> 01:35:11,378
We toasting to something?

1466
01:35:12,746 --> 01:35:13,881
- Nothing good.

1467
01:35:21,755 --> 01:35:22,389
(laughs)

1468
01:35:24,959 --> 01:35:28,429
You are gorgeous.

1469
01:35:31,232 --> 01:35:32,933
- I'll drink to that.

1470
01:35:34,935 --> 01:35:35,803
- Go ahead.

1471
01:35:37,137 --> 01:35:39,807
(glasses clink)

1472
01:35:44,011 --> 01:35:46,046
Why did you come and talk to me?

1473
01:35:48,782 --> 01:35:50,449
- What do you mean?

1474
01:35:50,451 --> 01:35:52,884
- Did you see something in me
you like?

1475
01:35:52,886 --> 01:35:56,156
- I do. Me, in about an hour.

1476
01:35:58,892 --> 01:36:00,227
- Oh, that's good.

1477
01:36:04,498 --> 01:36:08,202
- If you ain't interested,
you just say so, lady.

1478
01:36:09,169 --> 01:36:10,771
- Come on, tell me.

1479
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:16,542
Did you see something special in
me?

1480
01:36:16,544 --> 01:36:18,912
Or did you see a sure thing?

1481
01:36:20,281 --> 01:36:21,882
- I think you're...

1482
01:36:24,285 --> 01:36:28,053
I think I'm waiting on someone
else.

1483
01:36:28,055 --> 01:36:32,159
- Lots of fun until I got
something on my mind, huh?

1484
01:36:37,164 --> 01:36:40,899
- I guess, I can talk to you if
you want.

1485
01:36:40,901 --> 01:36:42,568
- Oh, I bet you can talk real
good.

1486
01:36:42,570 --> 01:36:45,973
I bet you can tell me how
beautiful I am.

1487
01:36:47,609 --> 01:36:49,276
- If you want.

1488
01:36:56,317 --> 01:36:58,152
- Tell me I'm good.

1489
01:37:12,399 --> 01:37:14,902
Tell me I ain't a piece of shit.

1490
01:37:17,938 --> 01:37:19,206
- You ain't.

1491
01:37:21,208 --> 01:37:22,577
You're good.

1492
01:37:27,948 --> 01:37:30,516
- You got a car, mister?

1493
01:37:30,518 --> 01:37:33,521
(car engine revving)

1494
01:37:46,568 --> 01:37:48,066
- Well, where did she go?

1495
01:37:48,068 --> 01:37:50,102
- How the hell I know, Sweeney?

1496
01:37:50,104 --> 01:37:51,038
- Goddammit!

1497
01:37:52,106 --> 01:37:54,272
- Sweeney, how are you?

1498
01:37:54,274 --> 01:37:55,608
- Get out of my way.

1499
01:37:55,610 --> 01:37:57,008
- If you're looking for
Lee, this is the place.

1500
01:37:57,010 --> 01:37:58,310
- What is wrong with you, woman?

1501
01:37:58,312 --> 01:38:01,146
- You ain't gonna change her.

1502
01:38:01,148 --> 01:38:02,615
- Just get out of my way, Pete.

1503
01:38:02,617 --> 01:38:04,684
- Why don't you get out of my
way?

1504
01:38:04,686 --> 01:38:05,951
- Watch it, boy.

1505
01:38:05,953 --> 01:38:07,520
- This boy'll whoop your ass.

1506
01:38:07,522 --> 01:38:09,955
(men grunting)

1507
01:38:09,957 --> 01:38:11,990
- Hit him!
- Goddammit!

1508
01:38:11,992 --> 01:38:13,561
- Hit him, Pete. Hit him.

1509
01:38:14,928 --> 01:38:16,261
- Damn it, get!

1510
01:38:16,263 --> 01:38:18,997
Shit! I'll kill him!

1511
01:38:18,999 --> 01:38:20,465
- You ain't gonna do
shit, you little pissant.

1512
01:38:20,467 --> 01:38:21,701
Sit down and shut up.

1513
01:38:21,703 --> 01:38:23,168
- Fuck you!

1514
01:38:23,170 --> 01:38:25,070
Fuck all y'all, I was
standing up for y'all

1515
01:38:25,072 --> 01:38:26,371
- Guess what y'all? Next round's
on Pete!

1516
01:38:26,373 --> 01:38:27,707
(people cheering)

1517
01:38:27,709 --> 01:38:30,976
- Yeah, drink your Coors
Light on me, assholes!

1518
01:38:30,978 --> 01:38:32,212
- Hey Bert,

1519
01:38:33,347 --> 01:38:35,113
if she ain't coming back,

1520
01:38:35,115 --> 01:38:38,952
you mind if I give these
lovely children a home?

1521
01:38:56,370 --> 01:38:59,940
(howling)

1522
01:39:07,181 --> 01:39:09,483
(soft music)

1523
01:39:28,101 --> 01:39:30,672
(fast breathing)

1524
01:39:37,478 --> 01:39:40,481
(car engine revving)

1525
01:40:01,268 --> 01:40:04,004
(car door shuts)

1526
01:40:15,650 --> 01:40:18,385
(Sweeney knocks)

1527
01:40:40,140 --> 01:40:42,677
(birds chirping)

1528
01:41:01,461 --> 01:41:04,331
(car horn honking)

1529
01:41:10,872 --> 01:41:13,238
Goddamn it, woman!

1530
01:41:13,240 --> 01:41:14,406
- Have you been drinking?

1531
01:41:14,408 --> 01:41:15,841
- No.

1532
01:41:15,843 --> 01:41:16,809
- Well, I don't even know
what you think you're doing

1533
01:41:16,811 --> 01:41:18,611
because there's no conversation
between us

1534
01:41:18,613 --> 01:41:19,712
till you start apologizing.

1535
01:41:19,714 --> 01:41:21,881
- I want the ice cream shop.

1536
01:41:21,883 --> 01:41:23,481
- What? That?

1537
01:41:23,483 --> 01:41:24,784
[Leslie] Mmhmm

1538
01:41:24,786 --> 01:41:26,184
- I spent too much of my life

1539
01:41:26,186 --> 01:41:27,352
hiding with people I don't even
know.

1540
01:41:27,354 --> 01:41:28,320
And I'm done with hiding

1541
01:41:28,322 --> 01:41:31,759
and I'm sure as shit
done with being run off.

1542
01:41:33,828 --> 01:41:35,528
- So you're gonna live in there?

1543
01:41:35,530 --> 01:41:38,129
- I'm gonna make something out
of it and you're gonna help!

1544
01:41:38,131 --> 01:41:39,065
- Why are you yelling at me?

1545
01:41:39,067 --> 01:41:42,467
- Because I'm excited! Get me a
hammer!

1546
01:41:42,469 --> 01:41:43,536
- Wait, you think you can
just tell me what to do

1547
01:41:43,538 --> 01:41:44,369
after you called me names-

1548
01:41:44,371 --> 01:41:45,671
- Get me a hammer.

1549
01:41:45,673 --> 01:41:46,507
- Okay.

1550
01:41:49,242 --> 01:41:53,512
(door opens)
(door closes)

1551
01:41:53,514 --> 01:41:56,716
- (grunts) Watch out!

1552
01:41:56,718 --> 01:41:59,652
- [Sweeney] Oh, watch out for
nails.

1553
01:41:59,654 --> 01:42:01,754
- Alright, this is it.

1554
01:42:01,756 --> 01:42:02,688
- [Sweeney] You need help?

1555
01:42:02,690 --> 01:42:06,592
- No, I got it. (sighs)

1556
01:42:06,594 --> 01:42:08,594
You know this is Royal's
daddy's, right?

1557
01:42:08,596 --> 01:42:09,695
- [Sweeney] Yeah.
- He thought it'd

1558
01:42:09,697 --> 01:42:12,898
be a real hit with the
kids, but didn't work out.

1559
01:42:12,900 --> 01:42:15,200
Now it's just been sitting
here, like, 40 years

1560
01:42:15,202 --> 01:42:17,369
just waiting for someone to give
it shot.

1561
01:42:17,371 --> 01:42:20,673
- Yeah, like a tetanus
shot or a hepatitis shot.

1562
01:42:20,675 --> 01:42:23,676
(both laugh)

1563
01:42:23,678 --> 01:42:27,780
Look, I saw that video and I
know you're excited about this,

1564
01:42:27,782 --> 01:42:29,949
but I mean, what do you know

1565
01:42:29,951 --> 01:42:32,217
about running a place like this?

1566
01:42:32,219 --> 01:42:34,954
- Well, what'd you know
about running a motel?

1567
01:42:34,956 --> 01:42:36,221
- No, I'm serious, alright?

1568
01:42:36,223 --> 01:42:37,923
I mean, unless you're hiding
some

1569
01:42:37,925 --> 01:42:39,558
other jackpot somewhere,

1570
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:42,193
I mean, you gotta get a
fryer, you gotta get a grill.

1571
01:42:42,195 --> 01:42:43,663
That's expensive.

1572
01:42:43,665 --> 01:42:47,232
And then you gotta hire a
cook and you gotta make menus,

1573
01:42:47,234 --> 01:42:48,266
you gotta get a soda
machine, you gotta get-

1574
01:42:48,268 --> 01:42:52,470
- Hey, that's very good,
do you wanna work here?

1575
01:42:52,472 --> 01:42:55,841
- All right. I mean, I
understand that you're excited,

1576
01:42:55,843 --> 01:42:58,577
but honestly, how are you
planning on paying for this?

1577
01:42:58,579 --> 01:43:00,846
I mean, you can't ask us
for a raise 'cause we can't,

1578
01:43:00,848 --> 01:43:03,250
we don't have it.

1579
01:43:04,919 --> 01:43:05,753
What?

1580
01:43:07,354 --> 01:43:09,590
- I'm gonna move in with you.

1581
01:43:11,659 --> 01:43:12,527
I can save.

1582
01:43:14,494 --> 01:43:16,329
I can work on weekends.

1583
01:43:18,666 --> 01:43:22,302
Hey, it might take 10
years, but let's do it.

1584
01:43:26,306 --> 01:43:26,941
- Okay.

1585
01:43:30,745 --> 01:43:32,812
- Yeah? (laughs)

1586
01:43:32,814 --> 01:43:34,816
- Well, I mean, I gotta ask
Royal.

1587
01:43:37,985 --> 01:43:40,586
- But you gonna ask him?

1588
01:43:40,588 --> 01:43:43,791
- Yeah, yeah, I'll ask him.

1589
01:43:46,293 --> 01:43:47,562
- Damn

1590
01:43:49,496 --> 01:43:51,431
Why are you so good to me?

1591
01:43:52,633 --> 01:43:53,968
- Well

1592
01:43:55,603 --> 01:43:59,272
I think it's pretty obvious by
now.

1593
01:44:08,616 --> 01:44:10,783
(soft music)

1594
01:44:10,785 --> 01:44:12,952
Okay.
(Leslie chuckles)

1595
01:44:12,954 --> 01:44:14,820
So we got work to do?

1596
01:44:14,822 --> 01:44:17,288
- Later.
- Okay. (laughs)

1597
01:44:17,290 --> 01:44:20,427
(soft music continues)

1598
01:44:21,461 --> 01:44:23,998
(birds chirping)

1599
01:44:25,398 --> 01:44:27,969
(train chugging)

1600
01:44:46,386 --> 01:44:48,888
Alright, floors are lookin'
good.

1601
01:44:48,890 --> 01:44:50,823
- I don't know, I think
we should mop em again.

1602
01:44:50,825 --> 01:44:52,091
- Oh, you're stalling.

1603
01:44:52,093 --> 01:44:53,893
Royal, we're doing this!

1604
01:44:53,895 --> 01:44:56,629
- I'm shakin' like a goddamn
leaf.

1605
01:44:56,631 --> 01:44:58,898
- Still think we shoulda
called the place "Royal's."

1606
01:44:58,900 --> 01:45:01,000
Put on some costumes, do it up
big.

1607
01:45:01,002 --> 01:45:03,836
- I ain't dressing up
like a goddamn princess.

1608
01:45:03,838 --> 01:45:05,638
- I know, a couple of
knights and a bridge troll.

1609
01:45:05,640 --> 01:45:06,705
I like it.

1610
01:45:06,707 --> 01:45:07,673
- People like themes.

1611
01:45:07,675 --> 01:45:09,440
- I said no, okay? Shut up.

1612
01:45:09,442 --> 01:45:12,578
(Sweeney laughs)

1613
01:45:12,580 --> 01:45:14,982
(door unlocks)

1614
01:45:17,552 --> 01:45:20,351
(all cheering)

1615
01:45:20,353 --> 01:45:21,854
- (claps) Here we go.

1616
01:45:21,856 --> 01:45:22,721
- Order up!

1617
01:45:22,723 --> 01:45:23,589
- Here we go.

1618
01:45:23,591 --> 01:45:24,523
(Royal laughs)

1619
01:45:24,525 --> 01:45:27,458
- Well, it's pretty quiet.

1620
01:45:27,460 --> 01:45:28,527
- We've been open a minute,

1621
01:45:28,529 --> 01:45:29,362
not even.

1622
01:45:30,363 --> 01:45:33,100
(crickets chirping)

1623
01:45:37,839 --> 01:45:38,673
Fuck 'em.

1624
01:45:40,608 --> 01:45:42,508
- Well, I don't know why
I'm doing this, anyway.

1625
01:45:42,510 --> 01:45:44,045
Why it even matters.

1626
01:45:45,012 --> 01:45:47,012
- They're just being mean.

1627
01:45:47,014 --> 01:45:48,747
They'll have to eat.

1628
01:45:48,749 --> 01:45:50,785
They'll come, they'll see.

1629
01:45:52,019 --> 01:45:55,790
- (sighs) I need a cigarette.

1630
01:46:22,717 --> 01:46:25,684
(door opens)
(door closes)

1631
01:46:25,686 --> 01:46:28,623
(crickets chirping)

1632
01:46:32,126 --> 01:46:33,661
(taps flask)

1633
01:47:00,888 --> 01:47:02,690
(inhales deeply)

1634
01:47:05,860 --> 01:47:07,795
(exhales)

1635
01:47:43,130 --> 01:47:45,166
(door opens)
(door closes)

1636
01:47:51,605 --> 01:47:52,571
We're closing up!

1637
01:47:52,573 --> 01:47:54,907
What the...

1638
01:47:54,909 --> 01:47:58,077
(car engine revving)

1639
01:47:58,079 --> 01:48:00,746
- Oh, here we go, it's about
time.

1640
01:48:00,748 --> 01:48:02,581
Royal, we got one.

1641
01:48:02,583 --> 01:48:04,049
- [Leslie] Well, tell 'em we're
closed.

1642
01:48:04,051 --> 01:48:05,584
- Lee, it's a customer.

1643
01:48:05,586 --> 01:48:09,254
- No, they've had all day, I'm
going home.

1644
01:48:09,256 --> 01:48:11,590
- Hey, Lee.
- What?

1645
01:48:11,592 --> 01:48:13,995
- Maybe you oughta slip out the
back.

1646
01:48:20,001 --> 01:48:21,734
I'll take care of it.

1647
01:48:21,736 --> 01:48:22,835
- You go to the back.

1648
01:48:22,837 --> 01:48:24,236
- No, I got it, it's fine.

1649
01:48:24,238 --> 01:48:26,572
- Go on.
- [Sweeney] No, I got it.

1650
01:48:26,574 --> 01:48:27,208
Go on.

1651
01:48:28,642 --> 01:48:29,308
- Okay.

1652
01:48:29,310 --> 01:48:30,277
- Take this.

1653
01:48:36,650 --> 01:48:39,251
Welcome to Lee's, how can I help
you?

1654
01:48:39,253 --> 01:48:40,753
(door closes)

1655
01:48:40,755 --> 01:48:42,321
- Two please.

1656
01:48:42,323 --> 01:48:43,858
- Just right here.

1657
01:48:44,992 --> 01:48:46,692
- What's wrong with a table?

1658
01:48:46,694 --> 01:48:49,563
- Well, that's reserved. For
members.

1659
01:48:52,700 --> 01:48:55,834
So will Dutch be joining you
tonight?

1660
01:48:55,836 --> 01:48:57,136
- No.
- Okay.

1661
01:48:57,138 --> 01:48:59,038
Well, I'll just get a menu for
you then

1662
01:48:59,040 --> 01:49:00,274
I'll just...

1663
01:49:02,743 --> 01:49:05,244
You're a little late,
so you wanna be quick

1664
01:49:05,246 --> 01:49:06,245
before we close the grill.

1665
01:49:06,247 --> 01:49:10,783
- Lee, you wanna pull
it back just a little?

1666
01:49:10,785 --> 01:49:12,253
- You did it, Nance.

1667
01:49:13,687 --> 01:49:15,821
No one came.

1668
01:49:15,823 --> 01:49:18,824
Congratulations, you
sure fucking showed me.

1669
01:49:18,826 --> 01:49:19,558
- Little girl-

1670
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:21,593
- I mean, Jesus fucking Christ,

1671
01:49:21,595 --> 01:49:23,629
couldn't you done this like a
year ago?

1672
01:49:23,631 --> 01:49:24,963
You watched me do all this

1673
01:49:24,965 --> 01:49:28,667
knowing you're gonna take it
away from me.

1674
01:49:28,669 --> 01:49:30,704
We was family.

1675
01:49:34,742 --> 01:49:37,778
How fucking mean are you?

1676
01:49:44,318 --> 01:49:46,821
- I'm sorry for what happened.

1677
01:49:49,790 --> 01:49:52,259
Do you hear me? I'm sorry.

1678
01:49:55,396 --> 01:49:59,033
And you were right, I
could have stopped you.

1679
01:50:00,868 --> 01:50:02,367
I saw what was happening,

1680
01:50:02,369 --> 01:50:04,872
I could have stopped it and I
didn't.

1681
01:50:06,640 --> 01:50:08,375
'Cause I was having fun.

1682
01:50:12,413 --> 01:50:15,247
But for all the nights you
made me hold that little boy,

1683
01:50:15,249 --> 01:50:18,050
all the times you made a liar
out of me

1684
01:50:18,052 --> 01:50:19,852
when I was the only one telling
him,

1685
01:50:19,854 --> 01:50:21,086
"Don't you listen to them
people.

1686
01:50:21,088 --> 01:50:22,354
I know your mama.

1687
01:50:22,356 --> 01:50:25,924
She loves you too much
to do you like this."

1688
01:50:25,926 --> 01:50:27,426
You shouldn't have left.

1689
01:50:27,428 --> 01:50:30,195
I don't care how bad you fucked
up, how stupid you looked,

1690
01:50:30,197 --> 01:50:31,396
that little boy loved you.

1691
01:50:31,398 --> 01:50:32,299
We all did.

1692
01:50:36,270 --> 01:50:38,237
I ain't never gonna forgive you
for that.

1693
01:50:38,239 --> 01:50:40,672
And I don't ask you to forgive
me,

1694
01:50:40,674 --> 01:50:43,644
but I think we've all
done enough suffering.

1695
01:50:52,019 --> 01:50:52,953
- Thank you.

1696
01:50:58,092 --> 01:50:58,926
- Yeah.

1697
01:51:04,698 --> 01:51:06,265
Now

1698
01:51:06,267 --> 01:51:08,102
wipe your face and

1699
01:51:10,037 --> 01:51:10,838
turn your head.

1700
01:51:12,406 --> 01:51:13,240
- What?

1701
01:51:21,148 --> 01:51:22,917
Oh my God.

1702
01:51:24,018 --> 01:51:25,717
I'll take two of them specials
and

1703
01:51:25,719 --> 01:51:27,953
I'd appreciate it if
you didn't spit in 'em.

1704
01:51:27,955 --> 01:51:30,055
- Two specials, hold the spit.

1705
01:51:30,057 --> 01:51:30,923
- Are you okay?

1706
01:51:30,925 --> 01:51:32,191
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1707
01:51:32,193 --> 01:51:34,461
(door opens)

1708
01:51:41,068 --> 01:51:42,935
(door closes)

1709
01:51:42,937 --> 01:51:44,405
- Hi.
- Hi.

1710
01:51:54,248 --> 01:51:55,914
- I guess I'll sit here.

1711
01:51:55,916 --> 01:51:57,318
- Sure, yeah.

1712
01:52:02,356 --> 01:52:03,855
(door swings opens)

1713
01:52:03,857 --> 01:52:05,359
- Hey, how you doing?

1714
01:52:06,327 --> 01:52:08,093
Sweeney.

1715
01:52:08,095 --> 01:52:09,428
- James, nice to meet you.

1716
01:52:09,430 --> 01:52:11,398
- Yeah, nice to meet you.

1717
01:52:13,234 --> 01:52:16,868
So did you drive all the way
down here?

1718
01:52:16,870 --> 01:52:17,504
- I did.

1719
01:52:20,407 --> 01:52:21,242
- Okay.

1720
01:52:23,143 --> 01:52:25,010
Are you hungry?

1721
01:52:25,012 --> 01:52:26,011
- I am.

1722
01:52:26,013 --> 01:52:27,479
Okay, alright.

1723
01:52:27,481 --> 01:52:31,316
Well, I'm just gonna fix this
fryer,

1724
01:52:31,318 --> 01:52:32,985
but maybe we can chat it up
later.

1725
01:52:32,987 --> 01:52:34,152
What do you think?

1726
01:52:34,154 --> 01:52:35,523
- Yeah.
- Alright.

1727
01:52:36,824 --> 01:52:38,190
Just made that pot of coffee.

1728
01:52:38,192 --> 01:52:39,326
- Okay, thanks.

1729
01:52:44,131 --> 01:52:45,565
- Well, would you like some
coffee?

1730
01:52:45,567 --> 01:52:49,001
- Please.
- Yeah, okay.

1731
01:52:49,003 --> 01:52:51,136
It's nice and hot.

1732
01:52:51,138 --> 01:52:52,406
Makes it good.

1733
01:52:54,908 --> 01:52:56,041
Sugar's here.

1734
01:52:56,043 --> 01:52:58,277
- Alright, thanks.

1735
01:52:58,279 --> 01:52:59,144
- Thank you.

1736
01:52:59,146 --> 01:53:01,815
(Leslie laughs)

1737
01:53:07,121 --> 01:53:07,953
(bell chimes)

1738
01:53:07,955 --> 01:53:10,858
- Okay, two specials comin' in
hot.

1739
01:53:12,459 --> 01:53:14,194
- Okay, pasta fazool.

1740
01:53:24,305 --> 01:53:25,337
- You got any silverware?

1741
01:53:25,339 --> 01:53:26,440
- Oh God, yes.

1742
01:53:30,144 --> 01:53:30,978
Got it.

1743
01:53:35,550 --> 01:53:37,182
I'll just leave you to it.

1744
01:53:37,184 --> 01:53:38,984
This is salt and pepper.

1745
01:53:38,986 --> 01:53:40,120
- Yeah, thanks.

1746
01:54:07,414 --> 01:54:08,248
Mom.

1747
01:54:09,483 --> 01:54:10,317
- Yeah?

1748
01:54:12,654 --> 01:54:13,887
- It's great.

1749
01:54:28,536 --> 01:54:30,104
I missed you, baby...

1750
01:54:32,574 --> 01:54:34,406
I've got pasta on my shirt.

1751
01:54:34,408 --> 01:54:37,309
(both laugh)

1752
01:54:37,311 --> 01:54:39,378
Oh, God, I missed you.

1753
01:54:39,380 --> 01:54:40,613
(soft guitar music)

1754
01:54:40,615 --> 01:54:41,448
- Yeah.

1755
01:54:42,983 --> 01:54:44,216
- Oh, baby.

1756
01:54:44,218 --> 01:54:47,988
(soft guitar music continues)

1757
01:54:54,194 --> 01:54:56,995
