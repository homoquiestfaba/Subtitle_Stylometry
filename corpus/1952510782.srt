1
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,315
Okay, come a little closer.
Tilt your head away.

2
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,712
All right, hold your position.

3
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,356
- I can't go till the end of the month.
- Really? That's too bad.

4
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,317
- They might be over by then.
- I know.

5
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,869
<i>N</i>e<i>w York</i> magazine made a list
where they're the best.

6
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,712
I read that.

7
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,429
Rebecca, you gonna see the leaves?
The leaves.

8
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,033
Upstate? They change colour?

9
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,075
No.

10
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,434
Apologise for the smell.

11
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,718
We cracked some of the windows,
but it still has that odour.

12
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,869
Oh, it's fine.

13
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,713
My mom was always cold, so...

14
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,030
Most of the windows
were actually painted shut.

15
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,189
Yeah.

16
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,352
So this stuff, it doesn't match...

17
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,479
...but it's no stains, good condition.

18
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,679
This stuff is all upholstered.

19
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,311
- How old?
- It's antique. Era pieces.

20
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,469
It's pretty dreary.

21
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,471
Checking the springs,
they feel loose.

22
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,959
Okay.

23
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,111
You don't buy the little stuff, right?

24
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,193
Like clothes and jewellery,
knickknacks?

25
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,035
No, we just...
Just furniture and artwork.

26
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,078
- Sometimes pottery.
- It's best to just get rid of this stuff...

27
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,312
...like this, all at once, right?

28
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,595
Yeah. Well, yeah...

29
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,355
I mean, it's probably junk.
I'm a busy person.

30
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,556
You shouldn't concern yourself
with that.

31
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,232
Yeah, I'll probably get rid
of something priceless like this...

32
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,631
...and not even know it, right?
- No, I don't think so.

33
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,349
- So are you gonna keep this place?
- No, no.

34
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,272
- I like the suburbs.
- Yeah.

35
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,318
Well, it's definitely big for the city.

36
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,268
- Lf you like the city.
- Right. Yeah.

37
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:37,116
It's a table, wood, oval...

38
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,798
- Hi.
- <i>Hi.</i>

39
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,949
It's weirdly hot today, huh?

40
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,755
Well, I work inside.

41
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,037
You have to go outside
to get to work...

42
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,919
...and then go outside to leave work.

43
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,239
- How's your grandmother?
- She's great. She's doing really well.

44
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,879
Good.

45
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,794
Why does she hate us so much?
What did we ever do to her?

46
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,110
She sees you, she sees death.
You're a vulture.

47
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,748
Us buying that apartment
has absolutely no downside.

48
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,593
Her grandmother gets to live there,
we're not hovering.

49
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,354
- You're a saint.
- Oh, God, it's just so sad.

50
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,636
- What?
- The old lady.

51
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,519
Andra, I mean.
Does she ever even go outside?

52
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,150
- What's so fun outside?
- The world, honey? Life?

53
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,550
- Maybe she's perfectly happy.
- Oh, no.

54
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,314
You just say that to rationalise
not feeling bad for her.

55
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,072
Why do I have to feel bad for her?

56
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,629
- She's at the end of her life.
- That's not my fault.

57
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,949
Oh, God.

58
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,669
- Hey, my zit medicine isn't working.
- You won't use what I tell you.

59
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,068
So I deserve it?

60
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,949
- I'm just trying to help you.
- Well, don't help me.

61
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,270
I don't know why
you don't go to Associated.

62
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,237
You do know.

63
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,109
If it was your money,
you'd walk the extra five blocks.

64
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,670
Yeah, well, it's 10 blocks.
And no, I wouldn't.

65
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,355
When my feet get better,
I'll do it myself.

- Hi.

75
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,238
Okay, could you please tell me
what a medallion is?

76
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,916
- It's, like, when you win something.
- These look like shit pellets.

- Sure. Thanks.

You should've seen
what she was wearing today.

79
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,711
It was this backless dress.
And man, does she have a big back.

80
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,110
Like a dude, you know?

81
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,919
You know, Mary, it's weird,
the way you watch her.

82
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,751
I don't watch her,
I walk by her store...

83
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,876
...and I can see what she's wearing.

84
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,111
What are we gonna do
for Grandma's birthday?

85
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,669
Oh, whatever.
When is she gonna croak already?

86
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,389
Come on, Mary, what if somebody
said something like that about you?

87
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,073
They probably already have.

88
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,231
I think I'm gonna buy her
a nightgown.

89
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,358
- How much?
- I don't know.

90
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,150
- She's just got this ratty old thing.
- I'll write you a cheque.

91
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,432
Hey, you know the neighbours?

92
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,273
They look at me, like,
"Is she dead yet?"

93
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,271
Why shouldn't they?

94
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,349
- Because it's wrong.
- You think if they didn't buy...

95
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,159
...her apartment she wouldn't die?
What's the difference?

96
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,551
- I like this texture. Yeah.
- Yeah? It's comfortable?

97
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,269
- Kind of stiff.
- Really?

98
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,429
Yeah.

99
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,989
- Handsome, isn't it?
- Yeah.

100
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,195
- Gorgeous.
- Yeah.

101
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,351
We just redid the cushions...

102
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,512
...but we found some original fabric
on the web.

103
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,715
A whole bolt.

104
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,359
How much?

105
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,996
- Let me check.
- Okay.

106
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,953
What's wrong with that piece?

107
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,509
- Not comfortable.
- Let's take it off the floor, then.

108
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,390
It's surprisingly comfortable.
Have another seat. Sit in it for a bit.

109
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,597
- Why did you do that?
- He might think it's comfortable.

110
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,991
- That's not possible.
- You don't know that.

111
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,234
It's 12.

112
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,832
It's 1200 dollars.

113
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,956
- Wanna hold it?
- No, gonna think about it.

114
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,633
- Okay. Hi, hon.
- Hey.

115
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,473
Did you guys look at that one?
That doesn't have any arms.

116
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,993
Hi, honey.

117
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,916
I saw some jeans I want.

118
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,957
Really? What for?

119
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,269
They're cute.

120
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,590
- How much?
- Two.

121
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,439
- Two hundred dollars?
- That's what you spend.

122
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,635
I'm a grown-up.

123
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,711
That makes no sense.
It's what jeans cost.

124
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,633
Abby, I am not spending $200
on a pair of jeans...

125
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,713
...for my teenage daughter when there
are 45 homeless people on our street.

126
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,791
What does that have to do
with anything?

127
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,313
- Abby.
- Hi, honey.

128
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,313
- You look so pretty.
- Right.

129
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,429
- Hey, what did you do this weekend?
- My wife and I drove up to Woodstock.

130
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,909
- Were they gorgeous?
- Oh, incredible.

131
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,150
I mean, the kids didn't care,
but we loved it.

132
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,118
Rebecca, you gonna go
see the leaves?

133
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,716
- No. I don't think so.
- Well, you should.

134
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,997
They're spectacular.
And they're just about to end.

135
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,319
You know what, next time we go,
we'll invite you to come with us.

136
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,358
Okay. Thank you. Thanks.

137
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,876
So it says here
that you were born in New York.

138
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,871
Yes, in the village.

139
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,080
Do you think that's good,
growing up in the city?

140
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,355
Yeah, I do. I mean...

141
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,795
I saw a lot of things
I probably shouldn't have...

142
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,552
...but it got me to grow up fast.

143
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,077
And I was really independent,
which, in some ways, is good.

144
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,795
I think it's an awful place
to raise kids.

145
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,912
Yeah. Yeah.

146
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,838
It's filthy, crime-ridden, noisy.
And it's only getting worse.

147
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,719
Well, that's definitely true too.

148
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,912
Yeah.

149
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,472
You know, it's funny, you said,
you know, in your questionnaire...

150
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,198
...that you had brown hair.

151
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,073
Yeah.

152
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,396
It's actually more of a dark brown.

153
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,952
I think it's brown.

154
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,510
No, I wouldn't call it brown.
It's almost black.

155
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,989
Yeah, but it's brown.
I mean, I didn't lie.

156
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,391
It's very dark brown.

- Hit the wall.

162
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,759
Yeah.

163
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,639
Not gonna look good
when she gets older.

164
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,918

his pubes today.

167
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:46,030
He doesn't want his penis hairs
to be longer than his penis.

168
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,949
Fucking Howard.

169
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,395
You know, you used to read books.

170
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,915
- Well, magazines.
- Please don't wreck my fun.

171
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,912
Will you rub my feet, please?

172
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,600
Jesus. How'd this one
get all mangled?

173
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,068
Your one toe
is completely horizontal.

174
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,276
Like I don't know that.

175
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,634
Go the other way, buddy.
Turn around, it's not too late.

176
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,992
I like it.

177
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,432
Bullshit.

178
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,469
Wow, you have beautiful hair.

179
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,837
I let it go grey when I was 40.
Why fake it?

180
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,355
Some people say
it makes you look older.

181
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,431
You know, that's probably true.

182
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,114
I didn't like the idea of chemicals
on my head.

183
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,352
And I didn't like the colour
everybody ended up with.

184
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,751
- Menopausal red, I used to call it.
- Right.

185
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,717
I know what you mean.

186
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,314
That's what my grandma has.

187
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,992
- How old is she?
- She's going to be 91 this week.

188
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,433
Okay. Just a little bit of compression.

189
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,428
Hold your position for me.
Try not to breathe.

190
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,759
Eugene.

191
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,713
Eugene, honey.

192
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,958
This is Rebecca. Rebecca,
this is my grandson. An angel.

193
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,513
- Hi.
- Hi.

194
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,069
- So can you see it?
- What?

195
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,356
My halo.

196
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,430
- Nice meeting you.
- You too.

197
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,837
What was that?

198
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,709
A hundred milligrams of sodium?
You shouldn't buy that stuff.

199
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,198
- You should cook them separately.
- Same difference.

200
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,592
- No, I think it takes longer.
- This is a fascinating conversation.

201
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,356
- Did you...? Hey, did you lay out today?
- Booth.

202
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,991
Mary, that's so bad for you.
You, of all people, should know that.

203
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,628
I'm very careful.
It's better than natural rays.

204
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,438
No.

205
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,797
- You could use some colour.
- I don't want cancer.

206
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,996
Blush doesn't give you cancer.

207
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,355
- Who is it?
- It's Alex from next door.

208
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,592
Andra, we're just going
to the drugstore. Is there anything...?

209
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,512
Hi, we're just going to the drugstore.

210
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,558
Would you like us to get you anything
while we're there?

211
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,158
- Hi, Andra.
- Perfect.

212
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,392
I hope you're not going to Windsor.
They're crooks.

213
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,028
- Metro. Metro. Metro Drugs.
- We're going to Metro.

214
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,872
- Yeah.
- It's better.

215
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,359
You gained weight.

216
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,352
- Excuse me?
- You gained weight.

217
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,589
Thank you.

218
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,752
- What?
- Thank you!

219
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,195
- Be right back.
- See you.

220
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,674
Jesus Christ.

221
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,350
Look at what she needs.
She has to take a crap.

222
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,794
She's old.

223
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,556
All those hairs on her chin.
You know, those thick black ones?

224
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,438
And all up in her schnozy.

225
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,830
I have hairs on my chin.

226
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,719
She's gonna be 91.

227
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,599
I know. It's unbelievable.
Who would have thought?

228
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,638
We should have bought that apartment
from that guy downstairs.

229
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,354
- Who?
- The guy right below us.

230
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,910
You know, Martin somebody.
He was only 79.

231
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,435
- That asshole died?
- Yeah.

232
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,478
No, the whole two-storey thing
would have been too much money.

233
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,834
Here you go.

234
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,719
- Thank you, honey.
- You're welcome.

235
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,076
Alex. Alex.

236
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,999
What?

237
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,434
Right over there on the other side
of the white table, please.

238
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:22,158
A little bit over. Perfect, perfect.
Thank you.

239
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,318
This is gorgeous. My God.

240
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,997
I think she kept it in plastic for, like,
50 years.

241
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,277
- Nice work, killer.
- Thanks.

242
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,829
- What is that?
- I'm not sure.

243
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,468
Just take the top
right on the base there.

244
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,911
That is gorgeous.

245
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,831
Holy cow. Look at this.

246
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,673
What do we ask for that? Four?

247
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,751
More. Five?

248
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,593
Six, seven. Eight.

249
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,153
Oh, I feel so guilty.

250
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,075
- Who sent us this?
- We got that for Andra.

251
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,708
It's her birthday.
I thought we'd have her over.

252
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,438
- You're joking.
- I'm not.

253
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,273
And her miserable granddaughters,
as well.

254
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,429
Sounds like a gas.

255
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,239
I don't wanna have bad vibes
right next door to us.

256
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,435
I feel terrible.

257
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,434
Hey. You know who I heard
had some great stuff? The dead guy.

258
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,315
- Downstairs?
- Yeah.

259
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,233
- Let's go.
- So sorry to hear about your dad.

260
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,833
Well, he was sick.

261
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,274
- He was old.
- Yeah.

262
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,829
We got the number from the super.
I hope that's okay.

263
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,116
- No, that's fine.
- Good.

264
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,036
I don't know if you're gonna
want any of these things, though.

265
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,668
I think there are definitely
some pieces we could use.

266
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,829
Yeah?

267
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,357
It's so old-fashioned. I didn't think
anybody wanted this stuff anymore.

268
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,599
Well, I guess you knew him.
You knew my Dad?

269
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,478
He lived in the building a long time.

270
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,871
- Yeah, he was a very nice man.
- Martin was lovely.

271
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,190
- Yeah.
- Lovely man.

272
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,156
So, what are you gonna do
with the apartment?

273
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,757
Oh, the neighbours bought it.
I think they wanna break through.

274
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,117
They're probably celebrating
over there.

275
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,474
- No.
- No.

276
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,789
How much did they pay?

277
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,312
What?

278
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,993
I'm so sorry. That was rude.

279
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,718
Kate. Jesus.

280
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,632
I'm very sorry. I'm...

281
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:24,079
This guy would throw away our mail
if it was put in his box by mistake.

282
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,992
Are you sure he knew who we were?

283
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,993
Of course he knew who we were.
He didn't give a crap.

284
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,515
Oh, my God.
That's where all my magazines went.

285
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,875
It's his fault that I watch
so much television.

286
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,759
Now he's dead, so you can go back
to reading magazines.

287
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,593
You know what, I wish
that your grandpa was still alive...

288
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,435
...so that you could hang out
with him like that.

289
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,954
I think that's his dad.

290
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,592
- That guy's... That guy's old.
- You're old.

291
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,320
Yeah, but I don't... I don't look...

292
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,675
I don't look like that.

293
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,274
- Will you wrap this up, please?
- Do I look like that?

294
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,749
- You got it.
- Thanks.

295
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,718
- Do we have any Pepto?
- I don't know.

296
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,155
I don't know if that place
is as good as we think.

297
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,993
Well, I don't think it's known
for burgers. Wait a second.

298
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,752
Excuse me, sir.

299
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,992
Are you hungry?
Would you like this?

300
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,511
I'm waiting for a table.

301
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,948
I'm sorry. I really am.

302
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,792
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm so sorry. Really.

303
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,916
- Please forgive me.
- We're very sorry.

304
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,988
- Are you out of your mind?
- He looked homeless.

305
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,755
He looked like a black man
waiting for a table.

306
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,396
- Hey.
- Hey.

307
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,878
- You do your grandma's laundry?
- Yep.

308
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,474
- Is it gross?
- What do you mean?

309
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,791
Like, old-lady underwear.

310
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,873
- I don't really look.
- Good idea.

311
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,074
So I heard you guys
are coming over later.

312
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,071
Yep.

313
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,320
- Cool.
- Yeah.

314
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,556
Hey, ladies.

315
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,597
Gorgeous day.

316
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,796
Going to see the leaves.

317
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,038
See you.

318
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,676
The leaves.
What is with these people?

319
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,831
- I know.
- Who gives a shit?

320
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,116
- I don't.
- Really.

321
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,158
Can I help you?

322
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,797
You shouldn't charge so much
for jeans.

323
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,831
Here. I'll do it.

324
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,675
When I get my eyes fixed
I'll be able to do it myself.

325
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,957
Grandma, you've got nothing
to drink in this place.

326
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,271
- Who's talking?
- It's Mary. She's looking for alcohol.

327
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,749
- This place is filthy.
- Hey, I clean it.

328
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,229
This has botulism.

329
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,595
Why exactly are we going there?

330
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,558
So they can poison Grandma
and demolish her apartment.

331
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,836
Then let's make it fast.

332
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,913
Here.

333
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,314
What's this?

334
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,875
It's your birthday present
from the two of us.

335
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,519
Go on, open it.

336
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,349
I got it.

337
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,312
Now, okay. Here.

338
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,588
Too fancy.

339
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,431
Yeah, well, do you like it?
I mean, look at it. Here.

340
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,796
What am I gonna do with this?

341
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,598
- Sleep in it.
- Say thank you, Grandma.

342
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,990
- I did.
- No. Actually you didn't.

343
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,112
Look, it's okay. It's just...

344
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,636
I thought
that since yours is so old that...

345
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,030
I'll save it for a special occasion.

346
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,156
What special occasion
might that be?

347
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,710
Too fancy to sleep in. That's all.

348
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,114
Come on in. Welcome.

349
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,669
- What's that smell?
- It's a little cramped in here.

350
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,353
Grandma. Jesus.

351
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,238
- I smell something burnt.
- Oh, you do?

352
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,949
Everyone can hear you. Sorry. She's
so rude. You should smell her place.

353
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,269
My place doesn't smell.

354
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,715
Piss and mould have no odour.
What was I thinking?

355
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,869
Mary.

356
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,508
Anyway, happy birthday, Andra.

357
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,752
- Can I get you something to drink?
- Do you have any bourbon?

358
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,194
I think we do have bourbon.

359
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,998
Hi. I'm Alex.

360
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,718
- I'm Mary. Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

361
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,838
- Hi, Mary. Where'd you get that tan?
- Oh, you know.

362
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,560
- She lies on a tanning bed.
- I go to the Sheep's Meadow.

363
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,154
- She lies on a tanning bed.
- And I go to Sheep's Meadow.

364
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,153
- Looks nice either way.
- Thank you.

365
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,749
Abby. Take those things off, please.

366
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,799
We have company.

367
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,791
What are you doing in here?

368
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,316
I don't understand that.

369
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,119
I'm not going out there
with this thing on my nose.

370
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,192
- You can't see it. Come out, please.
- See it?

371
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,636
Mom, it's swallowing my whole face.
How can you not see it?

372
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,678
I tell you not to eat those French fries
and greasy foods.

373
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,037
- It makes no difference.
- Please come and join us, Abby.

374
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,270
You look fine.

375
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,749
<i>Okay, I'm just...</i>
<i>L</i>e<i>t m</i>e <i>just</i> e<i>xplain it to you...</i>

376
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,990
...so you understand.
You know I'm not crazy.

377
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,038
- Lf she were younger than me...
- She is younger than you.

378
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,998
If she were prettier than me,
I'd understand, but she's not.

379
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,594
She's got this tan,
totally sprayed on, I would know.

380
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,149
But the worst part is her back.

381
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,194
- What about her back?
- It's muscular. All built-up.

382
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,555
- And she wears these skimpy tops.
- It's no good.

383
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,073
- No good.
- It's a big problem.

384
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,559
A big back is not good.

385
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,234
Oh, come on,
enough about the poor girl's back.

386
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,153
- Are you still in love with him?
- He broke up with her.

387
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,153
- No, that's not how it went down.
- Yes, it is.

388
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,828
I don't understand.
How is it that you get to see her?

389
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,673
Well, she works in a store
near where Mary works.

390
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,638
- And what do you do, Mary?
- I work at a spa.

391
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,673
It's called Skintology.

392
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,910
- I do facials.
- Oh, how nice.

393
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,150
What is it that you do, Rebecca?

394
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,039
Oh, I administer mammograms.
I'm a radiology technician.

395
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,590
- But you're not a doctor.
- No, I'm not a doctor.

396
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,798
But it's...
But you're not a doctor either.

397
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,995
I never said I was.

398
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,313
- Is it interesting?
- Well, if you like boobs, it is.

399
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,550
Well, you pop blackheads
for a living, so...

400
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,188
- What's the matter with boobs?
- Nothing.

401
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,112
Why are we talking like that?

402
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,589
So is it interesting?

403
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,830
I like the people, you know,
the patients.

404
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,558
Crush on the boss.

405
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,752
Pardon me?

406
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,790
Abby. Abby.

407
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,520
Honey, you have undies
on your head, sweetie.

408
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,478
She has a blemish,
which I can't even see.

409
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,914
Abby, please take those off.

410
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,071
Who is that? Is that funny?

411
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,879
You should come to the spa
and get a facial. They help.

412
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,076
- You're being rude.
- Let me see it.

413
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,800
Come on. You know, I've seen it all.

414
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,749
Oh, wow, that's big.

415
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,909
- Really?
- She's drunk.

416
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,231
On your nose, almost cystic.
It's horrible.

417
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,153
- Mary.
- No, I'd rather someone admit it.

418
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,912
At least then I don't feel crazy.

419
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,719
I'm just telling you,
half the time, I do feel crazy.

420
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,598
- No one says the truth.
- They should.

421
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,638
If you get a sucky haircut,
people should admit it. If some...

422
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,270
...procedure is gonna hurt, they should
tell you. It makes it worse if they don't.

423
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,431
I hate it when people
don't say "bless you."

424
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,750
You know what I hate?
When you're in a store...

425
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,195
...and you hold the door
for the person behind you...

426
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,191
...but they don't hold the door
for the person behind them.

427
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,759
You stand there
like a doorman.

428
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,230
- They don't say thank you.
- No, why would they? You're not there.

429
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,153
Jesus, I swear sometimes
I must be invisible. You want some?

430
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,912
Yeah.

431
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,316
What do we...? What is it? Like...

432
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,359
- We give him about 200 for Christmas.
- I give him nothing.

433
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,988
That's why he won't fix anything
for you.

434
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,958
If he fixed something for me,
I'd give him some money.

435
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,315
You know, they have,
like, 12 children.

436
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,675
Nobody told him to do that.

437
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:14,392
They're very poor. They live
in that apartment in the basement.

438
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:18,519
- I think his wife's in a wheelchair.
- I've never seen her in a wheelchair.

439
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,478
- Neither have I.
- I'm pretty sure.

440
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,840
So how do they make
so many children?

441
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,037
People can still fuck
in a wheelchair, Grandma.

442
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,949
Can't they?

443
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,998
- Why are you looking at me?
- I don't know.

444
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,399
He's a greaseball.

445
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,920
I.e. Meaning, he's Puerto Rican.

446
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,316
- Happy birthday, Andra.
- You're too nice.

447
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,310
- And this... This is for you.
- I hope you like it.

448
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,956
You wanna blow the candle out?

449
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,917
Make a wish.

450
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,199
These are some nice products.

451
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,838
I use Olay.

452
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,839
- I'll take it.
- No, you will not.

453
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,797
Thank you. That's kind.
She loves it.

454
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,599
She doesn't know how to use it.
Here, eat your cake.

455
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,354
So, what are you guys gonna do
with grandma's apartment?

456
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,677
We haven't really thought about it.

457
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,839
Are you gonna break through,
make the living room bigger?

458
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,709
You know, a new bathroom, kitchen.
We were gonna renovate anyway, so...

459
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,711
You'll have to change the tile
in there.

460
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,999
It's all covered with mould.

461
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,630
- I'd re-tile the whole thing.
- I'm sure they're gonna gut it.

462
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,519
You'll be dead,
so you don't have to worry about it.

463
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,191
So, wait... So tell me
what else are you guys gonna do?

464
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,710
Kate, are you gonna add
an extra bedroom?

465
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,075
- Mary, come on, shut up.
- What?

466
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,952
- I mean...
- Grandma...

467
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,998
...can they show us what they're
gonna do with your apartment?

468
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,278
Kate, what else are you gonna do?
What do you think?

469
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,189
Where exactly
are you gonna expand?

470
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,111
Well, we're gonna
break through that wall...

471
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,670
...and that'll be our master bedroom.
Over there is gonna be laundry room.

472
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,637
- Where?
- Right there.

473
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,189
That's so great.
Laundry is such a drag in the city.

474
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,557
It is. And the bedroom
will be a master bath and...

475
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,153
You're so lucky.

476
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,958
A proper closet, a real closet.

477
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,554
- It's gonna be gorgeous.
- Yeah, I know. I can't wait.

478
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:30,111
What do you mean? Of course we can
wait. We're not in any sort of rush here.

479
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,953
How's the cake?
How's that cake, Andra?

480
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,153
Dry.

481
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,838
You know, you were totally drunk.
It's embarrassing.

482
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,549
- I was not drunk.
- You're always drunk.

483
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,076
- You flirted.
- You don't even know what flirting is.

484
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,837
- You're an alcoholic.
- Why do you run around telling people...

485
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,194
...I use a tanning bed?

486
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,638
Well, because... It's because you lie.
On a tanning bed.

487
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,553
- So what? It's not hurting anybody.
- You're mean to Grandma.

488
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,995
She's a bitch.

489
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:14,273
- How do you fuck in a wheelchair?
- Well, I guess you go on the bed.

490
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,032
I mean, even if the legs don't work
the middle part might, I guess, huh?

491
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:24,035
- Man, she's even worse than I thought.
- Yeah.

492
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,471
You don't even know the super's wife.

493
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,873
Andra.

494
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,119
Awful.

495
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,238
- It makes me feel bad for Rebecca.
- Makes me feel less guilty...

496
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,868
...waiting for her to die.
- Wanting her to die.

497
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,234
Shit.

498
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:43,034
- Can't we put a pillow over her head?
- And start construction?

499
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,115
Hey. You were flirting
with the sister.

500
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,508
I know.

501
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,391
I have no idea why.
She's such a bitch.

502
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,629
Because she's young and pretty.

503
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,510
- Hi.
- Get out.

504
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,115
- Morning.
- Good morning.

505
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,592
Just gonna rewire this real quick.

506
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,149
Alex, come here for a second.

507
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,753
Another dealer is selling that table
for $5000.

508
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,480
That's great.
How much you pay for it?

509
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,358
Four thousand
for the whole apartment.

510
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,794
The guy had no idea?

511
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,318
He didn't wanna be bothered.

512
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,791
Then don't worry about it.

513
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,351
Let me know if I can help you
with anything.

514
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,351
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Sure.

515
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,752
Alex?

516
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,031
How come you feel so okay about it?

517
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,994
Because it's okay.

518
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,549
Okay.

519
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,756
I remember
when this was first in style.

520
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,911
I didn't like it then,
I don't like it now.

521
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,796
- How much is this one?
- Why are you asking?

522
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,589
- That is 8000.
- Okay.

523
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,594
- It's a sublime piece.
- I see.

524
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,194
- You can do many things with it.
- Thank you.

525
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,918
Sure.

526
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,599
- Welcome to Skintology.
- Thank you very much.

527
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,753
- Is Mary available for a facial?
- Which Mary? We actually have two.

528
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,869
Hi.

529
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,270
- How you doing?
- Great.

530
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,590
- Right this way.
- Okay.

531
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,910
They didn't get a good picture
or something.

532
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,119
No. You know, it happens.
It doesn't necessarily mean anything.

533
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,555
I feel bad making my grandson
schlep me back here.

534
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,188
He's a busy person. But single.

535
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,635
Never has a girlfriend,
I don't know why.

536
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,315
- You have a guy?
- No.

537
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,710
I mean, I'm trying.

538
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,279
You shouldn't have to try.

539
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:53,070
I went on a couple of computer dates.

540
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,755
- Oh, that must be awful.
- It was.

541
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,875
I figured if Howard Stern
can get a facial, so can I.

542
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,799
You know he had his nose done.

543
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,269
He looks great.
He's never gonna hit the wall.

544
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,034
I know. I love Howard.

545
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,949
Me too.

546
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,429
Eye cups. Close your eyes.

547
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,993
Oh, fancy. Really fancy.

548
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,352
- I love Artie.
- I know.

549
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,953
He kills me.

550
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,317
I wish I could play him all day
but I have to play this New Age shit.

551
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,436
Makes me want to kill myself.

552
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:31,350
I mean, what kind of guy tells the world
that he has a little tiny dick?

553
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,556
How cool is that?

554
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,593
Kind of.

555
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,675
- You have nice skin.
- Thanks.

556
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,193
I had terrible skin as a kid.

557
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,069
You know, poor Abby. Face is covered
with zits. I guess it's hereditary, right?

558
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:51,438
Well, you shouldn't blame yourself.
We'll let the steam open your pores.

559
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,117
Oh, it's part of the European facial.

560
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,316
Hand massage, shoulder massage.

561
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,469
Do you want it?

562
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,313
Sure.

563
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,272
It's okay. Don't... I'll get it.

564
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,875
I didn't know you were gonna do that.

565
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,998
Neither did I.

566
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,675
- Do you still want a facial?
- Yes, please.

567
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,833
- Excuse me. Can you help me?
- Oh, sure.

568
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,437
Beautiful, isn't it? Perfect condition.

569
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,152
What are you asking for it?

570
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,556
Fifty-five hundred.

571
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,716
How about five thousand?

572
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,917
Okay.

573
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,751
- Hi.
- You promised today.

574
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,036
- What did I promise?
- Jeans.

575
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,353
- No fighting.
- No fighting.

576
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,669
Where'd you find this?

577
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:41,079
- Really unusual colours.
- Yeah.

578
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,960
<i>Excus</i>e <i>m</i>e.

579
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,518
Do you know if everything's all right
with my grandmother?

580
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,272
You'll have to talk to the doctor.

581
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,479
He probably just saw something and
wants to make sure it's nothing.

582
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,756
- It's Rebecca, right?
- Yeah. Right.

583
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,717
- Eugene.
- Hi. Again.

584
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,359
- Hi.
- Hi.

585
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,958
- She's terrific, your grandmother.
- Yeah, she is.

586
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,191
She's pretty obvious too. You know,
she wants me to ask you out.

587
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,872
Right.

588
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,398
No, I meant that I want to.

589
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:23,028
- But?
- No but.

590
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,633
Would you like to go out with me?

591
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,600
Sure. Yes. Thank... Yeah.

592
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:36,191
Well, good. We can think
of something nice to do.

593
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:40,672
Actually, you know what?
I have some ideas.

594
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,673
Hi, sir.

595
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,593
- How are you?
- Good.

596
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,036
Five dollars?

597
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,555
Do you live on a sidewalk?

598
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,110
Those aren't bad.

599
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,470
No, honey, they're not. Turn around.

600
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,790
- I think these work.
- These suck.

601
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,552
- No, they don't.
- I look like a cow.

602
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,631
All right. Try those other ones on.

603
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,870
- Go ahead.
- What's the point?

604
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,712
Abby, just do it.

605
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,111
- She thinks she's fat.
- Shut up.

606
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:23,669
I like those.
I think those flaps are cool in the back.

607
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,871
They're in, anyway, right?

608
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,792
- Those are good.
- They're awful. I feel like a sausage.

609
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,234
I think they look cute.

610
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,472
- You think these look cute?
- Yeah. I do.

611
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,237
- Do you have eyes in your head?
- Please don't talk to me like that.

612
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,870
You must think I look like shit all
the time if you think these look good.

613
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,396
- I don't have to buy you anything.
- Fucking don't.

614
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,357
- How dare you? I'm leaving.
- Bye.

615
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:58,390
- Buy your own fucking jeans.
- I would if I had my own money. Bitch.

616
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,549
Excuse me, we're about to close.

617
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,355
You can't stay in there all night.

618
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,992
I mean, she was so rude.
I'm at a total loss.

619
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,513
Do you have a stomach ache?

620
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,832
Yeah, a bit.

621
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,197
- Where have you been?
- The store.

622
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,552
- This late?
- New fall hours.

623
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,836
Go walk your dog.

624
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,674
- Hi.
- Oh, hey.

625
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,274
- Hey. She's always there.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

626
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,919
My mom practically supports her.

627
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,640
- What do you mean?
- She always gives her money.

628
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,190
How do you think a homeless person
could have Chanel lipstick? It's gross.

629
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,351
Your mom gives her
Chanel lipstick?

630
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,750
She, like, wants to save the world.

631
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,112
One time, she let a homeless lady
take a shower in our apartment.

632
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,794
Your mom? That's nice.

633
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,394
Yeah, until the lady took a dump
on my bedroom floor.

634
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,471
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

635
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,359
She could've done it
in my mom's room. She let her in.

636
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,239
She gets all emotional
just walking down the street.

637
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,996
"Oh, my God. That man has no head.

638
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,833
Oh, my God,
that woman is disgusting."

639
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,115
It's so embarrassing.

640
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,399
- Are you close with your mother?
- I don't have one.

641
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:32,950
- I mean, she's dead.
- That's horrible.

642
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,989
- How?
- She killed herself.

643
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,512
How old were you?

644
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,272
Mary was 20. I was 15.

645
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,436
I'm 15.

646
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,396
What about your dad?
He must've been so mad.

647
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,755
No, he split
when we were really little.

648
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,309
He's somewhere,
but we don't know where.

649
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:59,439
- So who'd you live with?
- I lived with my grandmother.

650
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,315
This is so disgusting.

651
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,353
Right?

652
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,478
And now we're two people
walking around with shit in a bag.

653
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,398
I mean... I mean, what if we didn't have
dogs with us, and we were doing that?

654
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,916
That would be disgusting.
But because we have dogs, it's normal.

655
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,150
I never thought of that.

656
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,871
Do you come to your Grandma's
every night?

657
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,029
Almost.

658
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,510
- Why doesn't your sister come?
- She doesn't like her very much.

659
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:31,199
Mary's so cool. And gorgeous.

660
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,360
Do you think she could help me
with my skin?

661
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,996
- Can I help you find something?
- That's okay, I'm just looking.

662
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,037
Let me know if you have
any questions.

663
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,714
Thanks. This is great.

664
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,359
Yeah.

665
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,796
So, what makes you feel that this is
a good time, you know, to volunteer?

666
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,234
I mean, in your life.

667
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,391
Well, something's telling me to do it.

668
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,869
I just...
I wanna give something to someone.

669
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,476
Giving money is easy for me, but...
Thank god.

670
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,235
- I j... I want to do it.
- That's terrific.

671
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,994
A lot of the guests here
don't have family visit them.

672
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,628
If they do, it's generally once,
twice a year.

673
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,154
They love conversation.

674
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,392
And, of course, we keep it light.
Always wanna cheer them up.

675
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:31,998
- Cheer them up?
- We just don't wanna bring them down.

676
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:36,390
Sometimes all they can think about
is dying, so they wanna talk about it.

677
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,788
Shouldn't we?

678
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,029
Makes them sad.

679
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,633
And this is the common area.

680
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,030
We watch movies in here
on Saturday nights.

681
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,350
And residents play cards,
and just hang out.

682
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,750
- You could even play games with them.
- Oh, sure.

683
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,916
- Hi.
- Hi, Sandy.

684
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,832
Okay.

685
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:57,356
Maureen? This is Kate.
She might be volunteering here.

686
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,272
Hi, Maureen.

687
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,468
- She's very bent over.
- She has rheumatoid arthritis.

688
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,916
Oh, my God. Is it painful?
It looks very painful.

689
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:13,153
Yeah. But we try to be upbeat
and positive as much as we can.

690
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,035
Yeah. Yeah.

691
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,232
It's fine. It's okay. Here. Come on.
Bye, Sandy.

692
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,436
I don't wanna meet anyone new
at my age.

693
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,318
You don't have to be friends
with her.

694
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,153
I'm sure she feels the same way
about me.

695
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:30,710
Why would two old ladies
wanna be friends at this age?

696
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,030
Look, we're just taking a drive,
Grandma.

697
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,033
Come on, the leaves are going to be
really pretty, right?

698
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,553
Look, I think they're here.

699
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,870
Mrs. Portman, I'm so sorry.
I heard about the results.

700
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,076
When are you gonna
get the operation?

701
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,037
The surgery is scheduled
for next month.

702
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,189
Right.

703
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,634
What have you got?

704
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,756
It's cancer, a big lump.

705
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,831
Oh, what a horror.

706
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,719
The breast, it just comes off,
just like that.

707
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:59,316
Suppose you get a boyfriend,
then what?

708
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,879
You're funny, Andra.

709
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,714
See? She thinks I'm funny.

710
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,599
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Portman.
- It's okay. I'm an old lady.

711
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,433
It's a tragedy
when it's somebody young.

712
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,636
And I've been lucky.

713
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,677
Cancer is not lucky.

714
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,313
Okay, before the cancer.

715
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,912
- You got a handsome boy there.
- Thank you, Andra.

716
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,910
It's the truth.

717
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:29,316
- But he's very short.
- Grandma.

718
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:34,759
That's good. Otherwise, he would never
go for you if he was tall.

719
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:41,514
Becca is a lovely girl,
and I'm sure a lot of boys notice her.

720
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,672
What did I say? I didn't say anything.

721
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,274
Sure.
How's your sandwich, Grandma?

722
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,551
Mine's not good, mine's bad.

723
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:54,188
Okay. Well, mine's good.
You want some of mine?

724
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:58,239
- You want some of mine?
- No, yours looks bad too.

725
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,672
You have a lot of friends left, Andra?

726
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,149
Nobody's left.

727
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:07,790
I had friends. Not a lot.

728
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,074
I was very selective.

729
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:14,437
Good for you.
It's good to be selective.

730
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:19,637
A lot of people were jealous of me.

731
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,439
Because I was smart.

732
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,478
People often mistook me
for a school teacher.

733
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:32,998
I never finished high school
but people thought I was smart.

734
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:37,839
Well, I can see that.

735
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,592
So...

736
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:46,150
I think it should be somewhere
right around here.

737
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,671
This can't be it.

738
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,719
Well, maybe we just missed it.

739
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,270
Maybe we're too late,
or it's been too hot or something.

740
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,635
What's everybody doing?

741
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,518
We're looking at the view.

742
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,997
This is nothing.

743
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,838
- This...
- Oh, my gosh.

744
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,629
- This must be their peak.
- Yeah, this is the place.

745
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,597
Oh, my God.

746
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,955
It is pretty. Hey, Grandma.

747
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,118
Hey, Grandma.

748
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,431
It's for my daughter.

749
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:21,353
- How old is she?
- She's 15.

750
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:25,195
- Having a really tough time.
- That's so sweet of you to buy this.

751
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,554
She's going to love it.

752
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,191
- God, this is so cute.
- You like it?

753
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,670
Where'd you get it? Oh, Poppy.
What were you doing down there?

754
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:46,675
- Isn't this cute, Mom?
- It is. It really is gorgeous.

755
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,678
Thanks, Dad.

756
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:52,833
No matter how much lotion I put on
these things there's still just cracks.

757
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:59,350
It's just... Maybe I should go see that
what's-her-name over at the spa.

758
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,670
Get a paraffin dunk...

759
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,437
...or whatever.

760
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,592
- She does facials, doesn't she?
- Who?

761
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:11,589
- Who are you talking about?
- About the granddaughter with the tan.

762
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,797
- Who are you talking about?
- Same.

763
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,190
- She does facials?
- It's what she said.

764
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,513
Honestly, Mary,
they were so gorgeous.

765
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:27,399
Like they were on fire or something.

766
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,312
You should have worn sunscreen.

767
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:33,109
- Why? I don't think I got sunburned.
- Yes, you did.

768
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,550
You could create permanent
sun damage.

769
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,119
Mary, you're not at work. God.

770
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,350
It's not just my work.
I believe in what I do.

771
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,273
- Oh, come on, you sunbathe.
- With sunscreen.

772
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,032
I look better with colour.

773
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,909
You know, you're pretty.
You don't need to be tan.

774
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,034
I can't stop.

775
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,352
Just...

776
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,470
I'm glad you had a good time.

777
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:05,232
Hey, maybe Eugene has a brother
or a friend.

778
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,789
- Please.
- What?

779
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,554
I don't need you
to set me up with a boyfriend.

780
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:11,914
Sorry.

781
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,230
If I wanted a boyfriend, I'd have one.

782
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:41,194
You've made a very good choice.

783
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,828
We had put aside a couple of things.

784
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,310
Very, very unusual.

785
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,430
The Gemini initial too.

786
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,831
And the colours are really amazing.

787
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:12,916
I would also like to point out a chair.

788
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:16,390
An extremely rare... Excuse me.

789
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:20,991
This is an Eames chair.
It's very rare, 1942.

790
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,196
That particular piece...

791
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,236
Designer?

792
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,879
Resting.

793
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,792
I'm a designer.

794
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,669
I buy a lot of things from Kevin.
He's got great taste, doesn't he?

795
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:45,149
Except for that awful thing.

796
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:48,278
- That's a rare piece.
- It's still ugly.

797
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:52,228
And I think it's haunted.
Got a bad vibe.

798
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,392
Old furniture has ghosts.

799
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,556
I think so too.

800
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:02,473
How can they not? Right?

801
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,916
I had this bed. Iron. Victorian.

802
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,913
It was gorgeous. Fabulous detail.

803
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:12,914
I had nightmares for a year.
Then I developed TMJ.

804
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:18,074
Got rid of the bed. No more TMJ,
no more nightmares.

805
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,512
Is he a nice guy?

806
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:23,869
Oh, prick.

807
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:29,239
Good taste. Still a prick.

808
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,959
I always wanted that Corbusier chaise
but I'm allergic to cowhide.

809
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,839
I don't like sitting on things
with hair on them.

810
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,878
I think my grandmother
had this exact couch.

811
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:49,473
Where is it now?

812
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:52,074
- Here, apparently.
- Someone's making a killing.

813
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,549
The couch is original
leather upholstery.

814
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,359
- It's really beautiful.
- What a find.

815
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,751
- Yeah.
- Where do you find your stuff?

816
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,398
- Why?
- Well, I mean, like...

817
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:07,314
...do you get it from individuals or is
there like a store in Queens you go to...

818
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:09,948
...and just pick stuff out?
- Individuals.

819
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:12,429
We buy from the children
of dead people.

820
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,716
- How nice.
- Yeah, it's fun.

821
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,233
What a dick.

822
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,153
I feel like this would look good
in my house in New Paltz.

823
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:21,470
On the wall or on the floor.
I don't know.

824
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:24,074
I'm more of a floor rug person.

825
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,710
- It's actually a tapestry.
- No, it's not.

826
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:29,677
- Yeah, it's a tapestry.
- It's a rug.

827
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,311
Okay. It's a rug or a tapestry.

828
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,232
I'm like 100 percent sure
that's a rug.

829
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,516
I think you right. It's a rug.
Fucking idiot.

830
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,830
White, can I help you?
Yes, we do.

831
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,991
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Ambulance chasers.

832
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:43,833
I'm gonna make an appointment
for my wife to come see you.

833
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,752
<i>Mom lov</i>e<i>d h</i>e<i>r things.</i>

834
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,309
She just never told us
what to do with any of it.

835
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,870
- You from a Salvation Army?
- She's from a store on Tenth Avenue.

836
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,359
A junk store?

837
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:59,071
No, actually, it's a vintage,
modern mid-century...

838
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:02,118
She doesn't want this shit.
I told you to call Salvation Army.

839
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:03,838
She can say
if she doesn't want it.

840
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,468
- But she might.
- None of this is worth anything.

841
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,119
He just wasted your time.

842
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,874
Look at this chair. Look at it.

843
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,989
This is a great chair.

844
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,719
She died in it.

845
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,874
Oh, no, well, now she's really
gonna wanna buy it.

846
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,517
Actually, I think there are some things
in here that I could take.

847
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:31,434
Definitely those
two bookshelves and...

848
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:35,717
This tea cart's pretty charming.

849
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,996
The lamp with the greenery.

850
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:42,077
It's very kitschy.
I think that we can sell it pretty easily.

851
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,753
How much?

852
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,428
- Two thousand.
- Are you serious?

853
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,637
And the yellow chair.

854
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:55,390
See, I told you? Mom had good taste.

855
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:56,879
Yeah, she did.

856
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,879
Use these.

857
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,233
I will not.

858
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,076
What are you talking about,
"You will not"?

859
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,593
I won't.

860
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,991
- You'll use my coupons.
- No, I won't.

861
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,199
You're too good for coupons?

862
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:14,915
They depress me. If you want me to go
shopping for you, give me your list.

863
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:18,197
- I'll get Rebecca to do it.
- I told you, she's busy.

864
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:20,430
- Rebecca's never busy.
- Well, she's busy now.

865
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,352
And you should be happy for her.

866
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:25,239
- Give me your list.
- Lf you're not gonna take my coupons...

867
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,674
...l'll go shopping myself.

868
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:29,513
I came all the way down here.
And you can't walk that far.

869
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:32,148
You wait and see.
When my knees get better...

870
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,515
Arthritis gets worse, not better.

871
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,199
Mine's gonna get better.

872
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,549
Okay.

873
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:38,755
Like your eyes?

874
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,592
- Yes.
- And your feet?

875
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,757
Yes.

876
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,236
Don't do me any favours.

877
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:53,599
I'll get Rebecca to do it.
She didn't ask me so many questions.

878
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,392
<i>Laugh and th</i>e <i>world laughs</i>
<i>with you.</i>

879
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:08,552
Your feet hurt
because you're old, Grandma.

880
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,915
Things get worse, not better.

881
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:15,037

882
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,155
- Hi, Mary.
- Hi.

883
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,992
- How's it going?
- Pretty good.

884
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,310
She's got me going to the market
for her.

885
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,708
- Hi.
- Hey, how are you?

886
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:33,313
Very well.

887
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,390
You still got that tan.

888
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,755
It's kind of fading, actually.

889
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,116
I think I'm hitting the wall.

890
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,838
Thanks.

891
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,595
It's nice of you to shop for her.

892
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,830
It's not like I have a choice.

893
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,030
I guess I could starve her to death.

894
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,711
So, where do you go shopping?

895
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,911
In a market.

896
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:20,116
- Okay, well, bye. Later, see you.
- Okay. Good to see you again.

897
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:25,832
I'm gonna go and do some errands.
Some stuff I've been putting off.

898
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,675
- Okay. So I'll see you at the store.
- Okay. All right.

899
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:42,997
So like, I don't know exactly
what it is you do.

900
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:46,436
Well, I'm, you know...
I'm a computer consultant.

901
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,556
Yeah. But what is that?

902
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:52,793
Look, I'll tell you someday
when you want to go into a coma.

903
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:58,672
- Now, you have a great job.
- Yeah?

904
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:02,389
You know,
from a guy's point of view.

905
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,078
- Okay.
- No, I just... Okay.

906
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:08,516
Look, I just wonder
what made you decide to choose that.

907
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:12,229
Yeah. You know, I wonder that too.

908
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:15,070
Were you breast fed?

909
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:16,912
- No, I doubt it.
- Well, there you go.

910
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,559
What?

911
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:22,994
I mean, to be honest,
I don't really see them like breasts.

912
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:27,836
I see them more like
they're these tubes of potential danger.

913
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,312
- Tubes of potential danger.
- Yeah.

914
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,875
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

915
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,631
See you've got some new things.

916
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:42,392
All the time.

917
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:43,993
Where do you find all of this?

918
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,199
Why?

919
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,271
Just... Just curious.

920
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,114
I love this couch, honey.

921
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,275
Excuse me. How much for this?

922
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:03,069
- That's 4000.
- It's perfect for the playroom.

923
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:08,113
Oh, my God. Honey.
Take a look at this.

924
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,717
That is so bad, it's almost great.

925
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:14,838
I don't know, honey. It's kind of ugly.

926
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,116
Hey, miss. How much are these?

927
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:22,110
Those are 1400 for the pair.

928
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,234
Oh, are they important?

929
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:28,473
Well, we're not sure of the provenance
but I think they're quite nice. Yeah.

930
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:54,553
Come up here and fix the reception.

931
00:56:54,720 --> 00:57:00,033
Yes, it's your job. You're the super.
The super fixes things.

932
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,032
Idiot.

933
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:15,230
Leaving me here
without anything to eat.

934
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,919
Oh, shit.

935
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:21,400
What a mess.

936
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:25,316
You know,
I've never cheated on Kate before.

937
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:27,948
- How would I know that?
- Because I haven't.

938
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:30,111
So why now?

939
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:32,830
We're just like partners, you know?

940
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,595
We're partners at work.
We're partners as parents.

941
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:39,274
Partners in life.

942
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:41,633
We're friends, right?

943
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:45,475
I like my friends.
I don't really have any.

944
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,198
Friends are good. They are.

945
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:48,918
- How's she so skinny?
- What?

946
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:51,355
Kate, she's so beautiful
and she's so skinny.

947
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,080
- How does she stay so skinny?
- She worries a lot.

948
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,071
I worry a lot.

949
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,992
And you're skinny.

950
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:06,195
I'm sorry.
This is all just such a mess.

951
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:08,032
I'm a mess.

952
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:11,715
And I really never should've
started this and I'm sorry.

953
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:13,950
- I apologise.
- You know what some people say?

954
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:18,636
They sat that it's hard to imagine why
someone would have an affair...

955
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:21,553
...if there weren't something missing
in the marriage.

956
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:24,637
You know what I mean?

957
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:32,869
You know what else they say?
They also say sometimes it can help.

958
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:38,192
You know? Maybe it will.

959
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,270
Sometimes that's what they say.

960
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,316
I don't want to fuck you anymore.

961
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:00,350
Have you ever thought about
killing yourself?

962
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:02,158
No.

963
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:03,789
Why?

964
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,997
Rebecca's mother killed herself.

965
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:11,711
Oh, God, how horrible. No wonder.

966
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,791
No wonder what?

967
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,758
You can see how damaged
those girls are.

968
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:21,789
You don't ever think about
things like that, do you?

969
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:23,518
No.

970
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:27,957
Hey, I wonder where our friend is.

971
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:29,917
- Makeup man?
- Yeah.

972
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:32,799
Hopefully, he found a nice spot
near Sephora.

973
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,875
I hope nothing happened to her.

974
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:40,431
- You're worried.
- A little. She lives on the street.

975
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,955
You don't even know her.

976
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:45,918
Oh, God, look at this.

977
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:51,310
Hi. Here you go.

978
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:52,469
- No way.
- Abby.

979
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:55,154
You don't give me 20 dollars.

980
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:58,835
Abby. Give this man that money
right now, we'll discuss this later.

981
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,718
- No.
- Give it to me.

982
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,996
This is insane.

983
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:06,677
- I buy you everything you need.
- I'm keeping this 20 dollars.

984
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,831
Abby, please.

985
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:12,756
- Abby, I don't have another 20.
- So give him the 5.

986
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:14,638
- Give him the 20.
- So give him the 5.

987
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,950
- Give him the 20.
- No.

988
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:23,713
I'm sorry. I'm ashamed.

989
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:27,392
I'm sorry.

990
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,593
Honey, I just gotta ask.
What you were thinking?

991
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,912
This guy, this poor guy. His...

992
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:07,596
His wife or sister, whomever,
was just so mean.

993
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:11,548
I had to buy it. I felt so bad for him.

994
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:15,873
I mean, who's to say
this stuff isn't valuable?

995
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,871
I can. This stuff is not valuable.

996
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:21,476
Somebody liked it.
I mean, in 15 years this chair...

997
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,278
...will be worth a ton of money...

998
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:27,752
...because some genius German
designer, you know, designed it.

999
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,956
We're not gonna sell any of this shit.

1000
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:35,470
I already sold two shelves
for 1400 dollars.

1001
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:37,517
- You did? That's great.
- No, it's not.

1002
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:41,036
- I don't feel very good about it.
- I don't understand.

1003
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,077
I practically stole from them.

1004
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:45,595
Well, then why did you charge them
a ton of money?

1005
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:46,909
I wanted to.

1006
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,595
I've been feeling
really suspicious lately, Alex.

1007
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:56,360
People have been coming in
asking questions.

1008
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:59,956
- Like what?
- "Where does your stuff come from?"

1009
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:02,156
- "How do you get it?"
- People are like that.

1010
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:05,357
They're curious. They're curious about
where the stuff comes from.

1011
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:09,195
No. This is different.
People who we've bought stuff from...

1012
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:12,113
...are sending in friends,
or lawyers...

1013
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:15,352
...to find out how much we're selling
these things for.

1014
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:17,988
- Your guilt is warping you.
- Why isn't it warping you?

1015
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:20,037
It is. Your guilt is warping me.

1016
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:23,790
If this makes you feel so bad, if doing
this makes you feel so crappy...

1017
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:25,552
...do something else.
Stop doing it.

1018
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:28,075
Then somebody else
will just do what we're doing.

1019
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:30,595
That guy on Eighth Avenue,
with the store...

1020
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:34,753
...he's selling stuff that
he bought from us for more money.

1021
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:40,079
Quitting isn't gonna help anything,
Alex. Nothing helps.

1022
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:44,398
<i>- I hav</i>e <i>b</i>e<i>caus</i>e...

01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:54,279
Grandma?

1028
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:58,878

1033
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:20,959
Right this way.
This, obviously, is the gym.

1034
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:23,873
The kids come here
three times a week to play sports.

1035
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:29,274
This is something you could
actually help out with.

1036
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:37,715
And the cones
are not confusing at all.

1037
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:40,475
- What do you mean?
- There's, you know...

1038
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,517
It's a drill.

1039
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:46,028
Sweetie. Come here.

1040
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:50,518
This is Kate.
She's gonna be helping out.

1041
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:53,672
Kate, this is Abby.
Abby, this is Kate.

1042
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:56,559
- Thank you. Thank you, Kate.
- Nice to meet you.

1043
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,551
Abby is one of our most athletic.

1044
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,358
- Isn't that right, Abby?
- Yes, I am.

1045
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:02,431
Wanna show Kate
how well you shoot a hoop?

1046
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:04,397
- Yeah.
- Go ahead.

1047
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:11,720
Good job, Abby.

1048
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:20,598
- You wanna have a shot?
- No.

1049
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:22,637
- Go ahead. Give it a try.
- Go on. Try it.

1050
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,916
You try, you fail.
You try, you fail.

1051
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:26,991
Try again.

1052
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:32,752
Thank you.

1053
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:39,716
Very good.

1054
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:42,038
Thank you.

1055
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:46,032
What are you doing?

1056
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:50,235
Are you okay?

1057
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:53,552
I'm sorry. It's just so sad.

1058
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:56,957
You should go. Really.

1059
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,072
Okay.

1060
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:00,468
I'm sorry.

1061
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:09,559
Kate?

1062
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:16,958
You need any help?

1063
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:21,994
Do you want someone to help you?

1064
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:25,513
I'll be okay. I'm okay.

1065
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:36,598
You know, I should've been here.

1066
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:38,352
- I would have been here.
- Please.

1067
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:40,875
If I'd bought her groceries
I would have been here.

1068
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:43,429
What are you...?
Why didn't you buy her groceries?

1069
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,989
I thought you were supposed to.

1070
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:49,999
Here's something she got
a lot of use from.

1071
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:53,197
No special occasion, Grandma.
You should have worn the fucker.

1072
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:56,955
Don't do that. That's mean.
Stop it. Stop it.

1073
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:00,792
She was mean.
Why do you think Mom took 85 Valium?

1074
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:02,757
Because her mother
was loving and kind?

1075
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:05,673
- You can't blame Grandma.
- Why not?

1076
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:07,717
We don't have any family anymore.

1077
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:10,189
I gotta go back to work.

1078
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,391
I have appointments.

1079
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:14,312
You'll wait for the guy?

1080
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,996
Grandma's dead
and you're going to work?

1081
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:22,998
You're right.

1082
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:33,794
Oh, look.

1083
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:36,713
She's still dead. Bye.

1084
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:39,195
- You know, you're really cold.
- I know.

1085
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:07,111
Oh, hi.

1086
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:09,475
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm just...

1087
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:12,313
I guess washing dishes just makes me
want to kill myself.

1088
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:16,632
- Oh, God. I'm so sorry. It's an ex...
- Oh, no. I know. I know.

1089
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:20,875
I just wanted to tell you
that my grandma died.

1090
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:23,036
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1091
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,873
Come inside, please. Please.

1092
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:32,429
Do you think you could die if you
ate something from a dented can?

1093
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:36,275
You think that's what happened?
I don't think... I don't think so.

1094
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:41,468
Okay. No, I've just been taking care
of her for a really long time, you know?

1095
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:45,269
This pill that day, this doctor,
that medicine, not that medicine.

1096
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:48,750
And then she dies
from drinking bad juice.

1097
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:51,836
That didn't happen.

1098
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:54,273
Yeah.

1099
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:02,509
You're a really good person.

1100
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:04,079
You are.

1101
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:08,398
Thank you. Thanks.

1102
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:16,514
So are you.

1103
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:28,637
Can I help you with something?

1104
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:33,072
Yeah, that would be great.
Maybe in a while, when they come...

1105
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:36,152
...it would be great
if you could be with me. Thank you.

1106
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:01,396
Welcome to Skintology.
How can I help you?

1107
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:03,630
I'd like a facial with Mary, please.

1108
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:05,438
Okay, we have two Marys.
Which one?

1109
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:09,152
- Brown hair? Blonde hair?
- Brown.

1110
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:12,911
She actually had a cancellation...

1111
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:14,798
...if you can wait 30 minutes.
- Sure.

1112
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:36,557
Well, this worked out well.
It's a surprise to see you.

1113
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:39,518
Becca said she thought you could
do something for my pimples.

1114
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:41,477
I definitely can.

1115
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:46,634
We'll just open up your pores
and clean you out.

1116
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:51,631
Ever had a facial?

1117
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:55,836
My mom took me for one once
at this really fancy place.

1118
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,470
But it didn't work. They just rubbed a
bunch of cream on and made it worse.

1119
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:03,315
That's too bad. Just know
it's not your fault. It's hereditary.

1120
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:06,038
Yeah, my dad supposedly
had bad skin.

1121
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,191
That's right, he said it was terrible.

1122
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:09,839
Yeah.

1123
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:12,988
He had it for a long time too.

1124
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:19,078
- How do you know that?
- He comes in for facials.

1125
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:22,277
- My dad?
- Hey, Howard Stern gets them.

1126
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:24,237
Not from me, but a lot of men do.

1127
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:33,275
Is it okay if I take these off?
They're bugging me.

1128
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:35,158
Oh, sure. Yeah, yeah.

1129
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:47,477
Sorry, honey. It's not fun.

1130
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:51,510
My grandmother died.

1131
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:53,517
She did?

1132
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:57,030
Now your mom can have
her master bedroom.

1133
01:10:57,240 --> 01:11:01,791
That's too bad.
I mean, I'm sorry she died.

1134
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:04,239
- When did it happen?
- Not sure.

1135
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:07,710
We found her today,
so probably last night.

1136
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:09,472
Oh, here's a deep one.

1137
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:13,428
- Wiggle your toes.
- Okay.

1138
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:17,713
- Why?
- I don't know. It's supposed to help.

1139
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:22,558
That's like one of those things
that we hate.

1140
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:24,269
What?

1141
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:26,351
Like when people won't tell you
the truth.

1142
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:29,353
- Like, if you look bad in something.
- Oh, I don't follow.

1143
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:34,150
Like, saying wiggle your toes
it's just, like, a... Whatever.

1144
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:40,913
So.

1145
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:44,311
When did my dad come here?
I can't picture it.

1146
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:45,754
He's come in a few times.

1147
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:50,429
But he doesn't have bad skin.
What would he come in for?

1148
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:53,551
This and that.

1149
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:57,719
This and that?

1150
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:08,479
We should do an enzyme peel.
We get all the...

1151
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:10,910
And then get all the dead skin off.

1152
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:14,470
It kind of looks like you've been
hit by a truck right afterwards...

1153
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:16,517
...but in the end it's worth it.

1154
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:18,352
<i>Do</i>e<i>s th</i>e <i>building hav</i>e <i>a back door?</i>

1155
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:21,478
You know, for deliveries,
things like that?

1156
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:25,474
So we don't have to go out the front.
You know, not a glamorous sight.

1157
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:28,393
Yeah. In the basement
there's a door to the alley...

1158
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:32,792
...but, you know, there's always
a ton of stuff blocking it.

1159
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:36,709
I think maybe there's an exit
through the super's apartment.

1160
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:39,235
I know it's really messy.

1161
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:42,233
So sorry about your grandmother.

1162
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:47,033
She make me fix her TV.
She doesn't even give me any money.

1163
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:49,270
I see her last night.
She's not dead then.

1164
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:51,590
She be yelling at me
like I'm some kind of kid.

1165
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:53,193
I'm sorry she did that.

1166
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:57,990
- Can I give you something?
- I don't need a tip. She's dead.

1167
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:01,916
Yeah. Okay, thank you. Should we...?

1168
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:04,514
I'm happy to see
that you're feeling better.

1169
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:07,114
I was not sick.

1170
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:10,313
But weren't you in a...
You were in a wheelchair, right?

1171
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:13,395
- Me?
- Yeah.

1172
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:14,913
Oh, I'm sorry.

1173
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:18,038
Who told you I was in wheelchair?
I was never in a wheelchair.

1174
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:21,556
- I must've thought it was somebody...
- Why are you saying this to me?

1175
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,433
Where did you get that?

1176
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,795
- What?
- This.

1177
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:30,153
- This?
- Yeah. The box.

1178
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,238
It was a gift.

1179
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:36,718
Okay.

1180
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:51,549
Andra died.

1181
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:53,839
I know.

1182
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,275
- You do?
- Yeah.

1183
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:58,715
Oh my god, honey.
What happened to your face?

1184
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:00,319
I just had a facial.

1185
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:03,836
- From whom?
- Mary.

1186
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,873
What did she do to you?

1187
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:11,350
She gave me a peel.
And then she worked on me forever.

1188
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:15,393
Honey, this should not look like this.
I'm calling her now.

1189
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:17,312
- No, no.
- Honey.

1190
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:21,268
It's not her fault I have bad skin.
This is normal.

1191
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:23,913
She said it would go away.

1192
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:29,998
It will. It'll go away.
It will go away.

1193
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:09,558
Who are you?

1194
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:12,997
I've seen you walk by, over and over.
For months.

1195
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:15,594
And then you come in
and pretend to shop.

1196
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:17,990
- Why are you watching me?
- I love your store.

1197
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:20,390
And I'm also... I'm...

1198
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:24,237
I'm Brian's ex-girlfriend, Mary.

1199
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:29,637
- And?
- No, I just...

1200
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:33,356
I guess I just wanted to see
what he threw me over for.

1201
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:37,793
So that's why you watch me?

1202
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:43,838
I was curious to see what he thought
you have that I don't have.

1203
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,389
And did you figure out
what that was?

1204
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:48,148
No.

1205
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:50,996
You have nothing.

1206
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:54,117
You have a very large back.

1207
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:59,150
What kind of person, at your age,
does something like this?

1208
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:01,398
You know, it's very sad.

1209
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:04,313
You're old and you're a stalker.

1210
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:06,796
Loser.

1211
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:23,354
- What happened?
- Nothing.

1212
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:27,036
Rough pimple night?

1213
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:31,669
Mary gave me a facial.

1214
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:34,712
Mary?

1215
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:38,152
Yeah.

1216
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:41,671
Oh, you mean, like...

1217
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,434
...next-door granddaughter Mary?

1218
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:49,999
She's not very good, is she?
No offence.

1219
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,552
Don't worry.
I'm not going back there.

1220
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:55,592
Of course not.

1221
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:57,193
Neither should you.

1222
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:00,955
- Me?
- She said you went there.

1223
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:06,515
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

1224
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:09,239
She...

1225
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:13,717
She helped me with my skin.

1226
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:20,952
At my age, I mean, God knows.

1227
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:23,957
When does it stop?

1228
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:31,673
Yeah.

1229
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:35,958
No. No one is ever going back there.

1230
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:38,908
Ever.

1231
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:50,351
How's she doing?

1232
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:53,436
She's sad.

1233
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:57,195
It's so rough, her age.

1234
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:26,236
We should stand back, you know.

1235
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,960
- Why?
- Microwaves are bad for you.

1236
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:32,429
But we're cooking our food in it.

1237
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:35,194
They say it's different,
what comes out.

1238
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:47,439
<i>Th</i>e <i>city of Honolulu</i>

1239

01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:52,999

1248
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:41,959
- Oh, can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm Kate. Hi.

1249
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:44,588
I bought your mother's furniture
a while back.

1250
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:47,194
- Yeah.
- I wanted you to have this.

1251
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:49,954
It turned out to be worth
a bit of money.

1252
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:54,391
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

1253
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:59,199
- I thought it was all junk.
- No, no, no.

1254
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:02,029
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1255
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:06,435
- How much is it worth?
- About $700.

1256
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:09,429
I can't believe you brought it back.
That's...

1257
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,433
- That's pretty unusual.
- It was my pleasure, really.

1258
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:14,553
Bye.

1259
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:19,278
Shit.

1260
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:22,398
Andra participated
in many groups over the years...

1261
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:25,199
...and especially enjoyed
volunteering.

1262
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:28,598
She worked at the ASPCA
when she was a teenager...

1263
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:30,796
...and later on read to the blind...

1264
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:34,748
...and did art projects
with underprivileged children.

1265
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:37,388
She enjoyed reading a great deal...

1266
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:39,949
...but when her eyes began to fail...

1267
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:43,556
...she especially loved
watching television.

1268
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:47,833
Her favourite show was
<i>Ent</i>e<i>rtainm</i>e<i>nt Tonight</i>.

1269
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,797
Okay, so this is Eugene and Paulette.

1270
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:51,598
- This is Alex. And this is...
- Hi.

1271
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:53,512
- Alex. How are you?
- This is Kate.

1272
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:55,591
Hi, Paulette.

1273
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:58,399
Andra was a lovely woman.

1274
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:01,115
Not really. But thanks.

1275
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:02,838
She was very direct.

1276
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,515
- She had a sad life. She did.
- Maybe.

1277
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:09,872
So you're going to start renovating?

1278
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:12,755
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Pretty soon.

1279
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:14,273
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1280
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:16,351
I'm sure it's gonna be great.

1281
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:20,229
It'll be bigger. It'll be fine.
Who cares?

1282
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:23,871
- I'm gonna take her dog. So...
- Oh, that's great.

1283
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:26,793
But I guess it means I won't be
seeing you guys anymore.

1284
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:28,598
Oh, that's true.

1285
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:32,150
- We've sort of been neighbours. It's...
- Yeah.

1286
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:39,031
Her boyfriend was so handsome.

1287
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:41,236
He was. Very.

1288
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:43,231
Seemed so nice.

1289
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:45,352
He's pretty short.

1290
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:47,511
Not that short.

1291
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:49,318
Maybe he doesn't mind.

1292
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:51,596
Oh, he minds.

1293
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:55,389
- You can't know that.
- Yes, she can.

1294
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:23,317
What do you think?

1295
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:26,470
I think they look good.

1296
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:32,836
I think they cost $235.

1297
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,956
You wanna get them?

1298
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:37,955
- Really?
- Lf you want them.

1299
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:40,031
Oh, my God.

1300
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:46,877
Thank you.

1301
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,036
You're welcome.
