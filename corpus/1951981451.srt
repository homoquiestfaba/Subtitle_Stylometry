1
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,500
I'd say they've been dead
since this morning.

2
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,340
I'll check with Rachel,
but I-I think they were alive
when they were, er...

3
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,540
I've never seen anything like this.

4
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,700
And they've been joined in
the thighs, in the groin.

5
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:32,620
Looks like they're kissing.
They've been...hooked through the
throat to each other.

6
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,100
Meat hooks.

7
00:01:37,651 --> 00:01:41,711
Well, the killers reversed the van
back here onto the bridge.

8
00:01:41,711 --> 00:01:43,491
Opened the doors.

9
00:01:43,491 --> 00:01:46,451
Chain them to the railing,
dump them over the side.

10
00:01:46,451 --> 00:01:50,791
Then parked their van
back down in the car park.

11
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:52,591
Their signature's in the van.

12
00:01:55,951 --> 00:01:58,571
Paula Scott. Tamsin Green.

13
00:01:59,611 --> 00:02:01,471
Were they lovers?

14
00:02:01,471 --> 00:02:03,951
Is that why they're...?

15
00:02:03,951 --> 00:02:06,191
What's that?

16
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:23,231
It's got a gem missing.

17
00:02:23,231 --> 00:02:25,171
But it's definitely a man's ring.

18
00:02:25,171 --> 00:02:29,111
Why leave it here? Unless
that leads to our next victim?

19
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:35,151
The van was moved.

20
00:02:35,151 --> 00:02:37,351
Did anyone see the driver?

21
00:02:37,351 --> 00:02:39,031
Put out an appeal.

22
00:02:39,031 --> 00:02:40,911
Television, local radio.

23
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:42,491
Newspapers.

24
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:48,591
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

25
00:02:48,591 --> 00:02:51,631
You OK? Yeah, of course.

26
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:53,431
It's just...

27
00:02:54,491 --> 00:02:58,671
You'll get used to it.
I'm not sure you're supposed to.

28
00:03:31,074 --> 00:03:32,534
Stephanie Baker?

29
00:03:35,274 --> 00:03:37,874
Everyone calls me Steph.

30
00:03:37,874 --> 00:03:40,854
I'm afraid we've got some bad news.

31
00:03:42,454 --> 00:03:44,814
Stephanie... Steph...

32
00:03:46,414 --> 00:03:50,034
I'm afraid
there's no easy way to say this.

33
00:03:50,034 --> 00:03:53,294
Your partner,
Paula Scott's been murdered.

34
00:03:54,941 --> 00:03:56,601
Stephanie?

35
00:04:02,064 --> 00:04:04,704
How long have you lived with Paula?

36
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:08,859
I'm sorry, but I haven't got time for this. This is all...
- When was the last time you saw Paula?

37
00:04:09,726 --> 00:04:13,866
Four days ago. Your
partner's been missing for four days,
and you never reported her missing?

38
00:04:13,866 --> 00:04:17,386
I didn't report her missing
because she wasn't missing.

39
00:04:17,386 --> 00:04:20,106
Paula's a travel rep. They travel.

40
00:04:20,106 --> 00:04:23,426
We can do this at the station.
She was supposed to be in Scotland.

41
00:04:23,426 --> 00:04:29,366
She was supposed to be at a
conference. Am I supposed to presume
she's a liar? Is that all?

42
00:04:29,366 --> 00:04:30,846
I've got work to do.

43
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:36,077
Yeah, don't let your partner
being killed ruin your day.

44
00:04:38,277 --> 00:04:43,117
There's no way to tell
the exact time of death, due to the
conditions the bodies were found in.

45
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:46,477
But the blood spurts in the van and
round the wounds indicate they were
alive when they were hooked together.

46
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:50,586
Different deaths.

47
00:04:50,586 --> 00:04:52,286
Different backgrounds.

48
00:04:52,286 --> 00:04:55,666
So the only thing they have in
common is the signature, "Save me".

49
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,726
So we know it's the same killer.
And all the victims are women.

50
00:04:57,918 --> 00:04:59,538
So far. What about the ring?

51
00:05:00,108 --> 00:05:02,588
All they could tell us was
that it might be foreign.

52
00:05:02,588 --> 00:05:05,748
And we're going through missing
persons files for the last month,

53
00:05:05,748 --> 00:05:07,968
looking for descriptions
of personal items.

54
00:05:07,968 --> 00:05:10,048
They were alive

55
00:05:10,048 --> 00:05:17,568
when they were hooked together. Are
Paula and Tamsin being punished
because they were unfaithful?

56
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:20,128
Is that what these murders
are about? Is it punishment?

57
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:24,819
Vickie, get on to forensics.

58
00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:29,379
Get them to lay out everything
bagged from Catherine McArdle's
flat. All of it?

59
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:31,119
Yes! All of it!

60
00:06:03,999 --> 00:06:08,819
Too close to home? You knew Paula
was having an affair.
Where were you last night, Steph?

61
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:11,959
There was no conference
in Scotland, was there?

62
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:15,499
Steph. There's no shame in
admitting she was having an affair.

63
00:06:15,499 --> 00:06:18,279
You found Paula with
Tamsin, didn't you?

64
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:22,679
I wish to God I had. Maybe if I'd
found them, I wouldn't
have... And what? You killed them?

65
00:06:22,679 --> 00:06:25,519
I wouldn't have lost her for good.

66
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:30,319
It'd be different if
it was the first time Paula had...

67
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,759
Do you know what it's like
to watch somebody disappear
in front of your eyes?

68
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:38,399
Seven years together and she...

69
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,239
Are you done here?

70
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:44,399
Steph.

71
00:06:47,679 --> 00:06:48,919
What?

72
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,039
I bought them in a shop.

73
00:06:56,299 --> 00:06:59,499
Does this look the sort of
thing Catherine would wear?

74
00:07:05,776 --> 00:07:08,336
Hand-painted silk.

75
00:07:08,336 --> 00:07:10,296
"New Life Designs".

76
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:12,536
Artist's workshop in the East End.

77
00:07:12,536 --> 00:07:14,816
Expensive.

78
00:07:14,816 --> 00:07:16,276
Smarter.

79
00:07:18,456 --> 00:07:20,996
Angry woman in the expensive coat.

80
00:07:25,096 --> 00:07:30,276
'Your credit card
receipt was found amongst...
Your credit card receipt...

81
00:07:30,276 --> 00:07:32,396
'Mrs White, your credit card receipt'
was found among some stolen credit cards.

82
00:07:32,938 --> 00:07:35,638
Can you confirm a purchase with
New Life designers?

83
00:07:41,148 --> 00:07:42,948
Eccleshall.

84
00:07:46,228 --> 00:07:47,948
The Eccleshall receipt.

85
00:07:47,948 --> 00:07:49,828
Where's the Eccleshall receipt?

86
00:07:49,828 --> 00:07:52,408
What was her first name?
- Grace. She wasn't in.

87
00:07:52,408 --> 00:07:56,928
I'm trying to tell her.
- Grace. Just hang on.

88
00:07:56,928 --> 00:07:59,328
Grace Eccleshall.

89
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,740
We have a problem.

90
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:10,480
The scarf we found in Catherine's
room belongs to a Grace Eccleshall.

91
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,660
How's that a problem?
She's Richard Eccleshall's wife.

92
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,460
Richard Eccleshall
was also Isabel Price's tutor.

93
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,560
What, you think he killed her?

94
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,620
If he was Catherine's boyfriend,
he could be the father of her baby.

95
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,780
So there may be a link
between Catherine and Isabel.

96
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,180
But Isabel wasn't murdered.

97
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,080
But if Isabel's tutor
IS the murderer,

98
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,900
I don't want Rachel
to hear about this.

99
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,380
Lose something?

100
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,760
So you went around to Catherine's
flat to what? Compare notes?

101
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,320
I went around and told her
that I knew. Knew what?

102
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,920
She wasn't his first and she
needn't make plans to be his last.

103
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,140
So how often does this happen?
Once a year.

104
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:16,540
Twice? That's our business.
Not when your scarf turns up in
the flat of a murder victim.

105
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,140
He wasn't going to leave me for her.

106
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,000
So you admit that you threatened her?

107
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,460
I asked her to back off.
She wouldn't listen, we argued and I
left. What did you argue about?

108
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:29,000
About her hassling Richard.

109
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,580
Look, it was over in
about fifteen minutes.

110
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,740
That was the last time I saw her.

111
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,140
Now I've told you everything I know.

112
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,700
Sit down, Grace.

113
00:09:40,015 --> 00:09:42,735
You went in his place and
did his dirty work for him.

114
00:09:42,735 --> 00:09:45,435
How dare you?! Did you wait and
follow Catherine

115
00:09:45,435 --> 00:09:48,715
after she left her room? She wanted
to take him away from me.

116
00:09:48,715 --> 00:09:52,415
You don't just give up
on someone you love.
You fight for them.

117
00:09:52,415 --> 00:09:54,735
Would you kill for them?
Oh, for God's sake.

118
00:09:54,735 --> 00:09:58,375
Did you wait and follow Catherine
after she left her room?

119
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,335
Did you call her?

120
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:06,775
I went to work, I gave a lecture
and then I spoke to Richard.
Did your husband call her?

121
00:10:06,775 --> 00:10:08,955
She was pestering him.
Why would he call her?

122
00:10:08,955 --> 00:10:10,795
Where did you go after Catherine's?

123
00:10:10,795 --> 00:10:15,935
I went to a lecture. Then I came
back here, collected some clothes
and I went to stay with my sister.

124
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:19,235
You were angry with him? Yes.
You wanted to teach him a lesson.

125
00:10:19,235 --> 00:10:21,995
I wanted some space.

126
00:10:21,995 --> 00:10:24,415
Now I've told you everything I know.

127
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:27,655
When did you get back? This
afternoon. Your sister will confirm

128
00:10:27,655 --> 00:10:30,315
you've been staying with her for the
past three days?

129
00:10:30,315 --> 00:10:32,395
I've told you everything I know.

130
00:10:32,395 --> 00:10:36,335
Now I'd like you to leave, please.
Did Catherine tell
you she was pregnant?

131
00:10:40,575 --> 00:10:42,275
There's no proof it was his.

132
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:44,235
Did you tell Richard?

133
00:10:44,235 --> 00:10:46,315
She didn't love him.

134
00:10:46,315 --> 00:10:47,855
I do.

135
00:10:57,187 --> 00:11:02,387
So the intellectual structure
is in place by the third section.

136
00:11:02,387 --> 00:11:08,547
And where Paradise
offers us salvation and reward...

137
00:11:10,147 --> 00:11:15,027
Salvation and...
..reward for those who...
believe.

138
00:11:16,775 --> 00:11:18,615
What is, er... What is going on?

139
00:11:18,615 --> 00:11:22,235
Richard Eccleshall, I am arresting
you on suspicion of murder.

140
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:35,150
We know you were sleeping
with Catherine McArdle.

141
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:39,370
We know Catherine wanted
you to leave Grace for her.

142
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:46,050
Yes, but...
We know you wanted to get rid of
Catherine but she wouldn't listen.

143
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,750
It was fine.

144
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:55,070
You call this "fine"?
Did you and Grace kill her together?

145
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:57,570
Was that part of the
arrangement as well?

146
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:00,170
We want to do a DNA test, Richard.

147
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:03,170
What for?
You're the lecturer, work it out.

148
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,730
Catherine was pregnant.
-No.

149
00:12:05,777 --> 00:12:07,357
No, she... She couldn't have been.

150
00:12:07,357 --> 00:12:09,297
The baby died when she died.

151
00:12:09,297 --> 00:12:14,197
She would've told me. You don't
see women as people, do you? You
just see them as objects

152
00:12:14,197 --> 00:12:16,957
to be picked up and tossed aside at
the end of the year.

153
00:12:16,957 --> 00:12:20,277
Where were you in the early hours of
Monday morning? I was at home.

154
00:12:20,277 --> 00:12:23,077
While Grace was at her sister's?

155
00:12:28,437 --> 00:12:31,337
I-I've never seen that
woman before in my life.

156
00:12:31,337 --> 00:12:33,197
Really?!

157
00:12:33,197 --> 00:12:35,137
She used to work at the college.

158
00:12:35,137 --> 00:12:38,197
Your college.
Where were you on Tuesday night?

159
00:12:38,197 --> 00:12:42,237
I was at home.
While Grace was at her sister's?

160
00:12:51,297 --> 00:12:53,817
Where were you
the night before last?

161
00:12:53,817 --> 00:12:57,077
At home.
While Grace was at her sister's?

162
00:12:57,077 --> 00:12:59,597
I've never seen them before.

163
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,680
Who does this belong to?

164
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:09,760
I want my lawyer. Who does
the ring belong to, Richard?

165
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,660
(I've traced the ring.)

166
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:19,660
I've matched the description of
the ring to a recent missing
person's report.

167
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:23,900
John Giardello. 46. Italian
restaurant owner, North London.

168
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,300
He's been missing for six days.
His wife Emma made the report.

169
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,660
Get a photo and description
circulated. We have to find him.

170
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,240
I think he's found you.

171
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,560
..Can we trace this?

172
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,340
Do it.

173
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,960
Please help me.

174
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,760
Help me, please.

175
00:13:58,563 --> 00:14:01,683
How long has he got? ..He's in pain.

176
00:14:01,683 --> 00:14:03,563
If he's got no water...

177
00:14:03,563 --> 00:14:05,043
a few days.

178
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:13,563
Metal walls. The van.
The hold of a ship.

179
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:20,463
What about Computer Forensics?
In geek heaven.

180
00:14:20,463 --> 00:14:23,863
They're going through the
killer's message frame by frame.

181
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,583
Giardello drove to the bank with the
restaurant takings.

182
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:29,543
The money was never lodged. His car
is missing. Six days.

183
00:14:29,543 --> 00:14:32,143
He could be dead already.
If so, why send an e-mail?

184
00:14:32,143 --> 00:14:36,103
This wasn't just left at the scene.
This was sent directly to me.

185
00:14:36,103 --> 00:14:38,443
Your e-mail address is on the LMP
web page.

186
00:14:38,443 --> 00:14:41,923
It was sent via a chain of
re-mailers - Thailand, Turkey,
Russia.

187
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:43,983
Can it be traced?

188
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:48,583
Re-mailers scrub the computer's IP
address to ensure complete anonymity.

189
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,303
Where is he? Who?

190
00:15:00,303 --> 00:15:05,043
John Giardello. I'm giving you
one chance to help us save him.

191
00:15:05,043 --> 00:15:10,403
I've never seen him before in
my life. This is your evidence?!
Come on, we're going.

192
00:15:10,403 --> 00:15:13,383
DCI Metcalfe! He's still alive.
And while he's alive,

193
00:15:13,383 --> 00:15:16,883
that counts in your favour.
Hang on. You've just received these.

194
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:19,823
My client was in custody.
They were sent by a re-mailer.

195
00:15:19,823 --> 00:15:23,823
They're given specific instructions
where and when to send their e-mails.

196
00:15:23,823 --> 00:15:28,003
And you've got evidence?
Search his computer. How long
are you going to hold my client?

197
00:15:28,003 --> 00:15:29,543
As long as it takes.

198
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:47,303
There's a needle-puncture mark
to the arm.
PHONE RINGS

199
00:15:53,943 --> 00:15:56,363
Hello? ..Red.

200
00:15:56,363 --> 00:16:01,043
Yeah, I'll get Rachel for you...
Oh.

201
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,943
Oh. ..OK.

202
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,343
In an hour.

203
00:16:15,203 --> 00:16:17,963
What did he want?
He didn't say.

204
00:16:39,173 --> 00:16:42,773
I've tried to keep busy, but I'm
so tired, always fearing the worst.

205
00:16:42,773 --> 00:16:46,733
Well, sometimes it's, um...it's hard
not to fear the worst.

206
00:16:49,773 --> 00:16:52,293
Your husband drove to the
bank on Saturday?

207
00:16:52,293 --> 00:16:55,333
Mm-hm. John does the night lodgement.

208
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:58,473
The week's takings were just
over £3,000.

209
00:16:58,473 --> 00:16:59,933
Last time I saw him.

210
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:07,273
Put your heart and soul in a place.
Break your back night and day.
Non mangiare questo.

211
00:17:07,273 --> 00:17:08,753
Non mangiare quello.

212
00:17:08,753 --> 00:17:12,333
English, speak English.

213
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:16,473
Do you recognise this man,
Mrs Giardello?

214
00:17:16,473 --> 00:17:18,153
A customer maybe?

215
00:17:18,153 --> 00:17:19,753
A friend of your husband's?

216
00:17:19,753 --> 00:17:22,313
No. I don't think so.

217
00:17:22,313 --> 00:17:26,493
I mean, if he's only eaten
here once or twice... Mum?

218
00:17:26,493 --> 00:17:29,913
Oh, it's OK, Franco.
They're looking for your father.

219
00:17:29,913 --> 00:17:33,813
See, I told you. It's going to be OK.
Everything's going to be OK.

220
00:17:48,393 --> 00:17:50,733
I expect you do your
accounts on computer.

221
00:17:52,393 --> 00:17:55,953
We need to take them with us.
It's just routine.

222
00:17:58,293 --> 00:18:00,053
Do you know your dad's password?

223
00:18:00,053 --> 00:18:02,013
Well, I set it up for him, didn't I?

224
00:18:02,013 --> 00:18:03,693
His computer's upstairs.

225
00:18:03,693 --> 00:18:05,453
Giovanni is dead, isn't he?

226
00:18:05,453 --> 00:18:09,613
Isn't he? Stop talking like that.
She always sees the worst.

227
00:18:09,613 --> 00:18:11,833
No, I know what I
want to be true, but...

228
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:15,313
That's a nice photograph. Who's he?

229
00:18:15,313 --> 00:18:17,673
That's my Uncle Rico.
- I give birth to Giovanni.

230
00:18:18,054 --> 00:18:20,694
Black sheep of the family.
MRS GIARDELLO: His name is John.

231
00:18:20,694 --> 00:18:22,614
Family's important
at times like these.

232
00:18:22,614 --> 00:18:25,954
Senora Giardello...
..non e d'aiuto alla sua famiglia.

233
00:18:27,915 --> 00:18:30,895
Your dad never mentioned
he was being followed?

234
00:18:30,895 --> 00:18:32,875
Never felt like he was being watched?

235
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:35,915
Look.
He walked out on us, all right?

236
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:42,715
That's what happened. One minute
he was here, the next he...

237
00:18:42,715 --> 00:18:44,275
Look, you know what?

238
00:18:44,275 --> 00:18:47,495
Just good riddance.

239
00:18:47,495 --> 00:18:51,875
When you reported your husband
missing, you mentioned a ring.

240
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,295
Mmm. Yeah.

241
00:18:54,295 --> 00:18:57,775
I bought John a diamond-studded ring
on our honeymoon.

242
00:18:57,775 --> 00:19:01,075
He lost a gem on the
right side last year.

243
00:19:01,075 --> 00:19:07,495
I said to John, "We bought it when
we were broke and we'll fix it
when we're broke." Yes.

244
00:19:36,735 --> 00:19:39,235
No. You stay here.

245
00:19:57,815 --> 00:19:59,495
You don't have to do this.

246
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:07,015
Best seat in the house.

247
00:20:13,035 --> 00:20:16,455
We need you to confirm
that this is your husband.

248
00:20:18,855 --> 00:20:20,315
Anything.

249
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:25,095
Anything at all that you can see

250
00:20:25,095 --> 00:20:26,895
that can help us to find him.

251
00:20:46,055 --> 00:20:47,715
MRS GIARDELLO: Oh, God.

252
00:20:52,395 --> 00:20:54,955
Shall we get you a cup of tea,
coffee?

253
00:20:54,955 --> 00:20:57,575
Come on, let's go
in the family room.

254
00:20:57,575 --> 00:20:59,115
Mamma!

255
00:21:12,135 --> 00:21:14,135
I'm sorry.

256
00:21:14,135 --> 00:21:16,355
We've put a pipe in your system.

257
00:21:16,355 --> 00:21:20,435
It lets us monitor everything
coming and coming into your account.

258
00:21:20,435 --> 00:21:25,295
You've no shameful surfing
to hide, DCI Metcalfe, do you?!

259
00:21:25,295 --> 00:21:29,615
Anyway, the e-mail you received is a
video file. It's like any other
computer file.

260
00:21:29,615 --> 00:21:33,015
As soon as it's saved onto a
hard drive, it stores information.

261
00:21:33,015 --> 00:21:35,835
This one was created two days ago.

262
00:21:35,835 --> 00:21:38,175
Anything else? Plenty.

263
00:21:38,175 --> 00:21:41,095
It was filmed using a
domestic digital camera.

264
00:21:41,095 --> 00:21:42,695
Fairly standard resolution.

265
00:21:42,695 --> 00:21:45,835
The video's been compressed
using a Sorenson Codec.

266
00:21:45,835 --> 00:21:47,315
Anything useful?

267
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:51,755
The walls might be stainless steel.

268
00:21:51,755 --> 00:21:53,395
Curved.

269
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,435
Police stations make me nervous.

270
00:21:55,435 --> 00:21:58,735
I want you to do a DNA test
on a suspect. OK.

271
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:02,155
But why me and not Rachel?
The suspect is known to Rachel.

272
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:04,795
He may be the father of
Catherine McArdle's child.

273
00:22:04,795 --> 00:22:07,635
Richard Eccleshall.

274
00:22:07,635 --> 00:22:11,795
He was Isabel's tutor at college.

275
00:22:11,795 --> 00:22:13,475
He spoke at her inquest.

276
00:22:15,435 --> 00:22:17,735
You're asking me to lie to Rachel?

277
00:22:28,715 --> 00:22:31,075
Will this hurt?

278
00:22:31,075 --> 00:22:33,795
It's a painless procedure.

279
00:22:33,795 --> 00:22:35,955
Sir.

280
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:37,855
You won't feel a thing.

281
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:47,035
Giardello's and Eccleshall's
computers are clean.

282
00:22:47,035 --> 00:22:49,155
And Eccleshall is being bailed.

283
00:22:49,155 --> 00:22:54,255
Circumstantial evidence, hearsay,
this is not a fascist state. Blah,
blah, blah. The usual.

284
00:22:54,255 --> 00:22:56,715
We can hang onto him for withholding
evidence.

285
00:23:00,495 --> 00:23:04,675
Let him go. I can get him to
talk by the end of the day.

286
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:06,495
We haven't got enough to charge him.

287
00:23:10,695 --> 00:23:13,175
Put him under surveillance.
Discreetly.

288
00:23:14,715 --> 00:23:16,815
Check his wife's computer as well.

289
00:23:20,795 --> 00:23:25,195
McArdle, Fullerton, Greene, Scott.

290
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,955
The list ends here.

291
00:23:26,955 --> 00:23:29,535
We find John and we save him.

292
00:24:09,275 --> 00:24:11,315
You screwed up, didn't you?

293
00:24:11,315 --> 00:24:14,075
I was right. Isabel WAS murdered.
That's why Richard
Eccleshall was here.

294
00:24:14,137 --> 00:24:15,697
For the last time, Jack...

295
00:24:15,697 --> 00:24:20,097
Red thinks he killed Isabel and
Catherine. Doesn't he? Do you mind?

296
00:24:20,097 --> 00:24:23,957
Did you hear what I said? I did. But
I'm trying to pretend that I didn't.

297
00:24:23,957 --> 00:24:27,917
I'm talking to you. No,
you're talking AT me, Jack.
Learn the difference.

298
00:24:27,917 --> 00:24:30,997
You screwed up. I was right.

299
00:24:30,997 --> 00:24:36,917
Izzy's case is linked to Red's case.

300
00:24:36,917 --> 00:24:40,597
Everything all right? Yeah.

301
00:24:40,597 --> 00:24:42,217
It's fine.

302
00:24:49,877 --> 00:24:51,757
You asleep?! Take them, take them.

303
00:24:55,917 --> 00:24:58,237
DCI Metcalfe. There's another one.

304
00:25:06,457 --> 00:25:11,757
I wouldn't give him 12 hours.
The first file was 170 megs.
This one is double that.

305
00:25:11,757 --> 00:25:14,497
Definitely three bleeds.
Can you filter it?

306
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:26,650
It's a plane. He's near an airport.
Ssh, quiet. It's close.

307
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,490
Under a flight path.

308
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:31,170
It's a turbo prop. An ATP. STOL.

309
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:32,770
City Airport.

310
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:35,010
STOL? Short takeoff and landing.

311
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,810
Sounds like a train.

312
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:47,190
It's not a mainline, it's lighter.
A tube? No, it sounds...

313
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:50,070
DLR. Docklands Light Railway.
It's near the City Airport.

314
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:53,670
That's a tube. District line.

315
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:57,150
It runs above ground at Bromley by
Bow and crosses the DLR.

316
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:59,850
Air traffic approach routes.
Train lines.

317
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:02,110
We need somewhere out the way.
Isolated.

318
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:04,530
An industrial estate.
No, too many people.

319
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:06,430
There's a bonded warehouse here.
Security and staff.

320
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,510
There's too many people in there.

321
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:12,130
What about the gasworks? No. The
only one in the area was demolished.

322
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:13,630
Disused brewery?

323
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:20,270
Stainless steel walls. Vats.

324
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,790
Hang on.

325
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,490
There's something else.

326
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:14,890
Red! ..It's his car.

327
00:27:16,091 --> 00:27:19,291
There's a hypo,
and what looks like the money.

328
00:27:41,171 --> 00:27:44,131
We've got... I don't know.
We've got something.

329
00:27:56,831 --> 00:27:58,291
Clear!

330
00:28:08,291 --> 00:28:10,451
John Giardello! John Giardello!

331
00:28:12,811 --> 00:28:14,291
John Giardello!

332
00:28:34,931 --> 00:28:37,211
Where was that? Who was that?

333
00:28:55,087 --> 00:28:57,047
There's no rigor.

334
00:28:57,047 --> 00:28:59,867
It passes after 36 hours.

335
00:28:59,867 --> 00:29:01,427
He was dead already.

336
00:29:03,027 --> 00:29:06,247
I sat in that room, I watched him
suffer and he was dead already.Why?

337
00:29:07,973 --> 00:29:10,833
VICKIE: He was dead before the clips
were even sent to you.

338
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:12,833
RACHEL: No-one blames you.

339
00:29:16,313 --> 00:29:18,773
No-one has to.

340
00:29:28,313 --> 00:29:30,253
Red?

341
00:29:35,553 --> 00:29:37,033
What is it?

342
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:45,813
Per me si van e la citta dolente.

343
00:29:47,973 --> 00:29:52,613
Ne la citta dolente.

344
00:29:53,793 --> 00:29:57,073
I am the way to the city of weeping.

345
00:29:57,073 --> 00:30:00,293
I am the way to eternal grief.

346
00:30:00,293 --> 00:30:03,573
I am the way to the people lost.

347
00:30:03,573 --> 00:30:06,293
Abandon every hope,
all ye who enter.

348
00:30:09,993 --> 00:30:11,973
Dante.

349
00:30:16,375 --> 00:30:19,195
Catherine McArdle. Stung by bees.

350
00:30:19,195 --> 00:30:22,695
Claire Fullerton. Released from limbo.

351
00:30:25,415 --> 00:30:27,695
Tamsin Green and Paula Scott.

352
00:30:27,695 --> 00:30:30,215
The lovers. Lustful.

353
00:30:31,575 --> 00:30:34,695
Gluttony.

354
00:30:36,055 --> 00:30:39,855
We're in Dante's Inferno.

355
00:30:44,455 --> 00:30:47,755
The killer is condemning
his victims to hell.

356
00:30:51,336 --> 00:30:54,256
Toxicology, I need blood and urine
samples, please.

357
00:30:54,256 --> 00:31:00,856
Can you get the viscera bag and bowls
ready?

358
00:31:00,856 --> 00:31:03,216
Tim, do we have those
20ml syringes?

359
00:31:03,216 --> 00:31:05,576
The 50ml are going to
be too big for this one.

360
00:31:32,236 --> 00:31:34,376
I hear your voice every day.

361
00:31:38,896 --> 00:31:41,416
I want him to be alive
but I can't make him alive.

362
00:32:07,396 --> 00:32:10,756
The lacerations match
those in the other deaths.

363
00:32:10,756 --> 00:32:15,916
The scabs and clotting on his
wounds suggest they healed two,
three days ago.

364
00:32:15,916 --> 00:32:19,896
Apart from this obviously
self-inflicted wound. Thank you.

365
00:32:22,956 --> 00:32:26,256
Thank you for breaking your
lecture, Professor Robb.

366
00:32:26,256 --> 00:32:32,496
I'm not sure my head of department
classifies talking to a room full of
mostly empty chairs as a lecture.

367
00:32:32,496 --> 00:32:34,596
I'm also
not quite sure what I can do.

368
00:32:34,596 --> 00:32:36,736
Professor Robb,
thank you for coming.

369
00:32:36,736 --> 00:32:40,256
Dried flakes of blood in the mouth.

370
00:32:40,256 --> 00:32:44,976
Minor healed lacerations in
the throat and the oesophagus.
What's his stomach contents?

371
00:32:44,976 --> 00:32:50,916
Partial lumps of masticated
flesh, vein, small chips of
bone in the digestive tract.

372
00:32:50,916 --> 00:32:55,296
I suppose could account for
lacerations in the throat. Larvae. Mud?

373
00:32:56,797 --> 00:32:58,717
Oh, Christ.

374
00:32:58,717 --> 00:33:02,877
Oh, that's excrement.

375
00:33:02,877 --> 00:33:07,797
All right.
Let's send his bone chips off and
find out if they match the radius.

376
00:33:07,797 --> 00:33:13,317
I've heard that sometimes
mountaineers can cut through their
arm with a saw blade or penknife.

377
00:33:13,317 --> 00:33:17,577
Perhaps he tried to gnaw
his hand off.
How long would it take him to die?

378
00:33:17,577 --> 00:33:20,097
He was dying
of dehydration when he...

379
00:33:21,197 --> 00:33:26,457
The larvae in his stomach mean
a forensic entomologist can give us
an exact time of death. Tim?

380
00:33:26,457 --> 00:33:28,877
I'll have the samples packed up
as soon as we're done.

381
00:33:28,877 --> 00:33:31,537
He was dead long before we got there.

382
00:33:36,317 --> 00:33:37,777
He was dead.

383
00:33:40,637 --> 00:33:44,577
We saw him suffering
after he was dead.

384
00:33:47,657 --> 00:33:52,077
He was in hell. I can't do this.
You've got the wrong woman.
I'm sorry.

385
00:33:52,077 --> 00:33:55,597
There is no-one else.
There must be. I'm not the only
Dante expert in London.

386
00:33:55,597 --> 00:33:58,797
Please find somebody else.
But Professor Robb, if we...

387
00:33:58,797 --> 00:34:02,697
I interrupted my lecture.
Would somebody tell me
what the hell is going on?

388
00:34:02,697 --> 00:34:06,037
We've found something in his stomach.

389
00:34:22,837 --> 00:34:25,237
Here we go again.

390
00:34:25,237 --> 00:34:28,197
OK, attention please, everybody.

391
00:34:28,197 --> 00:34:29,677
Thank you.

392
00:34:31,157 --> 00:34:34,397
Professor Robb. ..Ah.

393
00:34:35,857 --> 00:34:39,877
Not quite sure where to start.
Well, from the beginning.

394
00:34:44,517 --> 00:34:47,157
Right, so, um...

395
00:34:47,157 --> 00:34:50,317
Dante was an Italian,

396
00:34:50,317 --> 00:34:53,337
writing in the fourteenth century.

397
00:34:53,337 --> 00:34:55,697
Um, he...

398
00:34:57,297 --> 00:35:02,217
Well, the Inferno is the first
part of the Divine Comedy.

399
00:35:02,217 --> 00:35:08,737
Um, Dante conceived the
Inferno as this enormous pit. Ah.

400
00:35:08,737 --> 00:35:10,477
Could you put it down there?

401
00:35:10,477 --> 00:35:11,897
Lovely.

402
00:35:16,357 --> 00:35:18,497
Thank you very much. Right.

403
00:35:18,497 --> 00:35:23,357
See, he imagined it as this huge pit
and he begins his journey

404
00:35:23,357 --> 00:35:33,817
outside the Inferno
at the Vestibule,
which is the entrance to hell.

405
00:35:33,817 --> 00:35:39,057
The Inferno has nine circles
spiralling down to the bottom

406
00:35:39,057 --> 00:35:43,277
and each circle that Dante travels
through represents a different sin.

407
00:35:43,277 --> 00:35:47,237
Like lust or violence.

408
00:35:47,237 --> 00:36:00,817
And as he passes from the Vestibule
down to the darkest, lowest
pit of hell,

409
00:36:00,817 --> 00:36:04,277
inflicted
on the souls in each circle.

410
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:08,390
The Vestibule.

411
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:10,830
The entrance to hell.

412
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:13,350
Punishment of the indecisive.

413
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:18,890
People who were indecisive in life
were made to follow a blank banner
in death.

414
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:23,530
For Dante they were, um...

415
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:28,770
They were "souls who lived a life
with no blame and with no praise,

416
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:32,270
"neither faithful nor
unfaithful to their God."

417
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:34,270
Please.

418
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:36,370
Catherine McArdle.

419
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:41,150
Dropped out of college.

420
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:43,170
Couldn't hold down a job.

421
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:46,790
The punishment?
"Stung again and again by the hornets

422
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:51,250
"and the wasps that circled them
and made their faces run with blood.

423
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:55,210
"Their blood, mixed with their
tears, dripped to their feet.

424
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:57,930
"And disgusting maggots
collected in their pus".

425
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:03,410
The entrance to hell was
supposed to be at Gehenna.

426
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:07,350
And Gehenna was this
garbage dump outside Jerusalem.

427
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,990
Indecisive in life.

428
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:12,390
Stung into action in death.

429
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:14,390
Circle one.

430
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:17,110
The unbaptised, or Limbo.

431
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:20,710
Claire Fullerton.
Her life had been on hold
since the death of her daughter.

432
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:25,110
Ten years later she was still
visiting the spot every week.

433
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:28,570
"For this defect and no
other guilt, we are lost.

434
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:30,510
"In this alone we suffer.

435
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:32,750
"Cut off from hope,
we live on in desire."

436
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,030
She was in Limbo.
The hospice was a
metaphor for her life.

437
00:37:34,974 --> 00:37:36,434
She suffered.

438
00:37:38,034 --> 00:37:41,034
She was in grief. Untormented grief.

439
00:37:41,034 --> 00:37:42,874
Circle two.

440
00:37:42,874 --> 00:37:45,454
Lust.

441
00:37:45,454 --> 00:37:48,334
"I came to a place
where no light shone.

442
00:37:48,334 --> 00:37:53,774
"The infernal storm sweeps and
drives the spirits in its blast...

443
00:37:53,774 --> 00:37:59,474
"tossed and whirled by winds,
lashing them with punishment."

444
00:37:59,474 --> 00:38:03,834
Now this circle is a perfect example
of Dante's use of contrapasso.

445
00:38:04,764 --> 00:38:11,384
Um, your punishment in hell
mirrors - or is the opposite of -
your sin.

446
00:38:11,384 --> 00:38:15,204
What I was once in life,
I now am dead.

447
00:38:15,204 --> 00:38:17,044
The violent shed blood in life,
their punishment is to lie in
a river of blood in death.

448
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:20,900
The adulterous lovers,
divided in life,

449
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:25,800
now become the doomed souls
eternally united in hell.

450
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,060
Your sin is used
and turned against you.

451
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:32,080
I thought this was
supposed to be a comedy.

452
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:37,060
Tamsin Greene, Paula Scott.

453
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,680
"If you use your body
as an animal in life...

454
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:44,280
"I will treat you as an animal
in death."

455
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:49,580
John Giardello.
Circle three. Gluttony.

456
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:55,740
The sinners in this circle are
forced to gorge on mud
and excrement,

457
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:59,160
instead of the wine and the
food they dined on in life.

458
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,420
The killer has taken us to circle three.
There are six circles to go.

459
00:39:04,167 --> 00:39:09,447
Six murders,
or sets of murders, to go.

460
00:39:11,747 --> 00:39:14,207
What about the next circles?

461
00:39:14,207 --> 00:39:17,687
Circle four
is the spendthrifts and hoarders.

462
00:39:17,687 --> 00:39:21,447
Circle five, the violent
lying in a river of blood.

463
00:39:28,088 --> 00:39:32,228
Circle seven, violence
against property, self and God.

464
00:39:32,228 --> 00:39:35,728
Circle eight is, um, fraud.

465
00:39:38,588 --> 00:39:40,328
And circle nine...

466
00:39:40,328 --> 00:39:43,428
Circle nine is
the lowest pit of hell.

467
00:39:43,428 --> 00:39:45,268
The worst sin of all.

468
00:39:45,268 --> 00:39:48,048
Treachery.

469
00:39:48,048 --> 00:39:49,528
OK, OK. Um...

470
00:39:52,668 --> 00:39:54,728
Hoarders and spendthrifts?

471
00:39:54,728 --> 00:40:00,628
Well, um, the sinners that Dante
witnessed being punished in this
level of hell were mostly priests.

472
00:40:00,628 --> 00:40:03,928
Roman Catholic priests.

473
00:40:09,128 --> 00:40:14,208
It must be a priest.
Well, there must be something else
in Dante to narrow this down.

474
00:40:26,648 --> 00:40:29,348
Have you got some
good news for me?

475
00:40:29,348 --> 00:40:32,188
I thought that was
your job, Father.
How long is it this time?

476
00:40:32,188 --> 00:40:33,948
We have to head off early again,
Father.

477
00:40:37,208 --> 00:40:43,988
The lost souls
were forced to ram enormous rocks
into one another's chests.

478
00:40:46,708 --> 00:40:51,148
I'm sorry, Dante thought that all
priests were sinners. Corrupt.

479
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:57,148
"Their undistinguished life
that made them foul made it hard
to distinguish them now."

480
00:40:57,148 --> 00:41:01,928
Do you know how many
priests there are in London?
I think we're about to.

481
00:41:01,928 --> 00:41:03,528
We can't protect them all.

482
00:41:05,228 --> 00:41:06,508
Red.
We can't protect them all.

483
00:41:06,618 --> 00:41:08,778
We protect them all.

484
00:41:23,978 --> 00:41:25,518
I'm in position.

485
00:41:45,578 --> 00:41:49,618
What's been happening?
He hasn't left the
building all morning.

486
00:41:49,618 --> 00:41:51,078
Grace went out about an hour ago.

487
00:42:27,298 --> 00:42:30,278
Grace is back.

488
00:42:48,538 --> 00:42:50,738
You killed my daughter.

489
00:42:53,798 --> 00:42:55,498
Get off!

490
00:42:56,638 --> 00:42:59,958
He's killing him! He's killing him!

491
00:42:59,958 --> 00:43:01,418
Help him!

492
00:43:04,558 --> 00:43:06,558
Say it!

493
00:43:10,498 --> 00:43:12,758
Say it.
Or so help me, I will kill you.

494
00:43:24,678 --> 00:43:27,158
He killed her! He killed her!

495
00:43:27,158 --> 00:43:28,618
Jack! Jack! Get up!

496
00:43:29,376 --> 00:43:31,656
Where's Eccleshall?

497
00:43:36,162 --> 00:43:38,642
You've got five minutes, Jack.

498
00:43:38,642 --> 00:43:40,102
All right?

499
00:43:56,858 --> 00:43:59,158
Eccleshall killed Izzy, Rachel.

500
00:43:59,158 --> 00:44:01,478
Jack. Listen to me, Rachel.

501
00:44:01,478 --> 00:44:02,958
He killed her.

502
00:44:05,018 --> 00:44:08,118
He's her tutor...
Well, WAS her tutor.

503
00:44:09,238 --> 00:44:14,438
It doesn't
matter if you try and kill him,
she isn't coming back. She's dead.

504
00:44:14,438 --> 00:44:20,478
So why's Red had him in as a
suspect? Why's Red had a DNA
test carried out on him?

505
00:44:22,078 --> 00:44:23,518
No.

506
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:28,198
No, Red wouldn't. Hasn't he told you?

507
00:44:31,918 --> 00:44:33,758
No, I didn't think so.

508
00:44:37,398 --> 00:44:39,598
His first victim was Izzy.

509
00:44:39,598 --> 00:44:41,258
He started with her.

510
00:44:41,258 --> 00:44:43,758
Then he moved on to McArdle,
Fullerton.

511
00:44:43,758 --> 00:44:48,818
..Red wouldn't keep it from you
unless he thought
there was something in it.

512
00:45:02,868 --> 00:45:05,248
Thanks for coming in.

513
00:45:05,248 --> 00:45:07,128
Charge me or release me.

514
00:45:10,008 --> 00:45:13,528
Where's your husband, Grace?
I said charge me or release me.

515
00:45:21,828 --> 00:45:23,328
You must really love him.

516
00:45:25,568 --> 00:45:30,248
I can't see any other reason why you
would do all this. Do all what?

517
00:45:30,248 --> 00:45:33,468
So long as Richard comes back,

518
00:45:33,468 --> 00:45:36,788
you'll put up with his affairs.

519
00:45:39,868 --> 00:45:41,708
You'll wait for him.

520
00:45:41,708 --> 00:45:44,248
Believe his lies

521
00:45:44,248 --> 00:45:47,248
when he comes back late from a
tutorial.

522
00:45:47,248 --> 00:45:51,788
Assuming that
the till death us do part is...

523
00:45:51,788 --> 00:45:54,808
is not a lie. It's not.

524
00:45:55,948 --> 00:45:59,128
And I do.
I do love him.

525
00:45:59,328 --> 00:46:04,468
You can't choose the bits of a
person to love and forget the rest.

526
00:46:04,468 --> 00:46:06,448
You either love them or you don't.

527
00:46:06,448 --> 00:46:10,248
And if you love them,
you'll do anything for them.

528
00:46:11,808 --> 00:46:14,648
Including believe his lies?

529
00:46:14,648 --> 00:46:17,848
Most couples I know measure
their marriage by something.

530
00:46:19,468 --> 00:46:26,768
Years together, income, their kids,
what they have,
what they haven't got.

531
00:46:26,768 --> 00:46:28,748
A lie

532
00:46:28,748 --> 00:46:30,948
is as good a foundation as a truth.

533
00:46:30,948 --> 00:46:32,408
And what about them?

534
00:46:34,128 --> 00:46:35,688
The girls.

535
00:46:37,288 --> 00:46:40,048
The Catherine McArdles
of this world...

536
00:46:41,628 --> 00:46:43,828
..and all those lies?

537
00:46:43,828 --> 00:46:46,188
I'm still here.

538
00:46:46,188 --> 00:46:47,748
Catherine isn't.

539
00:46:47,748 --> 00:46:52,608
That sounds like a confession.
It's an observation.

540
00:46:52,801 --> 00:46:54,761
The difference between them and me

541
00:46:54,761 --> 00:46:57,761
is that they try to change him.

542
00:46:57,761 --> 00:47:00,201
I accept him for what he is.

543
00:47:00,201 --> 00:47:02,921
And maybe some day he will change.

544
00:47:02,921 --> 00:47:06,021
It won't be because I made him.

545
00:47:06,021 --> 00:47:08,881
There are two kinds of lies, Grace.

546
00:47:11,121 --> 00:47:13,201
The one that you get away with.

547
00:47:14,961 --> 00:47:18,641
And the one you get caught in.

548
00:47:18,641 --> 00:47:20,921
Which was Richard's last lie?

549
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:22,701
The one that you caught him with?

550
00:47:24,781 --> 00:47:27,541
Or where he was when
Catherine McArdle was murdered?

551
00:47:29,121 --> 00:47:31,121
Charge me, or release me.

552
00:47:32,501 --> 00:47:36,361
Grace, my arse. Have you ever met
a more inappropriately named woman?

553
00:47:36,361 --> 00:47:41,861
I think we're looking
at the wrong Eccleshall. What are
you going to do about Jack?

554
00:47:45,044 --> 00:47:48,844
Richard Eccleshall is the father
of Catherine McArdle's child.

555
00:47:50,444 --> 00:47:52,724
Glad I can be the
bearer of such good news.

556
00:47:54,744 --> 00:47:56,544
Rachel. Um...

557
00:47:56,544 --> 00:47:58,584
I know that...

558
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:00,804
Izzy killed herself.

559
00:48:02,864 --> 00:48:05,504
I am not Jack.

560
00:48:05,504 --> 00:48:09,644
Next time,
do me the professional courtesy,
and don't go behind my back.

561
00:48:13,704 --> 00:48:15,164
I'm sorry.

562
00:48:17,404 --> 00:48:19,544
So am I.

563
00:48:24,843 --> 00:48:26,903
You're being bailed.

564
00:48:26,903 --> 00:48:30,883
Under the terms of your bail,
you're suspended from duty.

565
00:48:30,883 --> 00:48:35,243
You are not to go anywhere near
Richard Eccleshall. Is that clear?

566
00:48:35,243 --> 00:48:37,943
Why?
You're not the forgiving type, Red.

567
00:48:39,663 --> 00:48:41,743
We all make mistakes.

568
00:48:41,743 --> 00:48:46,503
Why is it so important to you to
believe that Eccleshall did it?

569
00:48:48,983 --> 00:48:51,943
You wouldn't understand.

570
00:48:51,943 --> 00:48:53,943
The last time you spoke to Izzy...

571
00:48:57,223 --> 00:48:58,703
..what happened?

572
00:49:02,103 --> 00:49:03,963
Nothing. Nothing special.

573
00:49:20,983 --> 00:49:23,783
Can I help you?

574
00:49:23,783 --> 00:49:26,883
738.

575
00:49:26,883 --> 00:49:30,083
Sorry?
The answer to Duncan's question.

576
00:49:30,083 --> 00:49:32,663
There are 738 Catholic
priests in London.

577
00:49:32,663 --> 00:49:34,703
They've been warned
and offered protection.

578
00:49:34,943 --> 00:49:37,823
The rest are being tracked down
or spoken to as we speak.

579
00:49:38,883 --> 00:49:40,943
But?

580
00:49:40,943 --> 00:49:43,323
There was a priest who
was still on the list.

581
00:49:43,323 --> 00:49:44,963
He left the priesthood last year.

582
00:49:44,963 --> 00:49:47,303
Decided it wasn't for him.

583
00:49:47,303 --> 00:49:48,903
Defrocked priests?

584
00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:51,083
They're the real
sinners, aren't they?

585
00:49:51,083 --> 00:49:53,143
I mean, we could narrow it down.

586
00:49:53,143 --> 00:49:56,703
No, no. No.
No, don't narrow it down.

587
00:50:02,483 --> 00:50:07,463
Some of these priests were kicked out
the Church, others seem to have left
voluntarily.

588
00:50:12,883 --> 00:50:17,163
Those are the details we have
of everyone who's ever
passed through our doors.

589
00:50:17,163 --> 00:50:19,543
I'm not sure how reliable
the addresses are now.

590
00:50:19,543 --> 00:50:23,543
No, this is a big help, Father.
It's just Simon now. Simon Emerson.

591
00:50:23,543 --> 00:50:28,163
I suggest you restrict
your movements. Travel in pairs
with someone you trust.

592
00:50:28,163 --> 00:50:34,023
Anything unusual or suspicious,
contact us, no matter
how trivial it might seem.

593
00:50:34,023 --> 00:50:38,043
I'm surprised you managed to get
anything out of Monsignor Noonan.

594
00:50:38,043 --> 00:50:41,163
He normally refuses
to acknowledge we even exist.

595
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:46,823
The Church hopes by forgetting us,
the rest of the world will forget
we were ever part of the Church.

596
00:50:46,823 --> 00:50:49,103
How did these men become...
..casualties?

597
00:50:50,304 --> 00:50:51,784
Various reasons.

598
00:50:55,364 --> 00:50:57,904
They battle their
own individual demons.

599
00:50:57,904 --> 00:51:02,164
They pay for their sins in
this life, and will continue
to pay for them in the next.

600
00:51:02,164 --> 00:51:04,664
Do any of your residents
have trouble with money?

601
00:51:04,664 --> 00:51:07,164
Take a look around you.

602
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:10,124
Giving up a lifetime's
vocation can be hard.

603
00:51:10,124 --> 00:51:13,644
It's hard to keep these men
from falling even further.

604
00:51:13,644 --> 00:51:18,284
This refuge is all there is
between them and the streets.

605
00:51:18,284 --> 00:51:22,864
Some people think they're lost
and not worth saving. I disagree.

606
00:51:22,864 --> 00:51:24,864
Doesn't it bother you...

607
00:51:24,864 --> 00:51:26,844
being abandoned by the Church?

608
00:51:26,844 --> 00:51:29,804
Sometimes the Church doesn't
have all the solutions.

609
00:51:29,804 --> 00:51:33,204
You have to look elsewhere
for the answer.

610
00:51:33,204 --> 00:51:35,804
Duncan. We need a car down at
Farrick Road.

611
00:51:35,804 --> 00:51:39,324
There are 20 ex-priests here
all with a reason to be angry.

612
00:51:39,324 --> 00:51:42,304
And can you pull the
files on any of these names?

613
00:51:42,304 --> 00:51:44,744
Run a check on Simon Emerson.

614
00:51:44,744 --> 00:51:46,904
Simon Emerson.

615
00:51:46,904 --> 00:51:49,964
Thomas Brown. Joseph Sweeney.

616
00:51:52,264 --> 00:51:53,724
Patrick Murphy...

617
00:52:14,184 --> 00:52:19,644
The souls that Dante witnessed
being punished at this level of hell
were mostly priests.

618
00:52:19,644 --> 00:52:22,044
Roman Catholic priests.

619
00:52:46,644 --> 00:52:48,604
Red.

620
00:52:48,604 --> 00:52:54,264
When Emerson was a parish priest,
he killed a teacher who'd been
abusing a ten-year-old girl.

621
00:52:54,264 --> 00:52:58,664
The teacher confessed
the abuse to Emerson several times
and refused to seek help.

622
00:52:58,664 --> 00:53:01,024
So Emerson took matters
into his own hands?

623
00:53:01,024 --> 00:53:06,604
He handed himself in to the police.
He confessed, pleaded guilty. He even
refused a solicitor at the trial.

624
00:53:06,604 --> 00:53:08,184
The anger of a righteous man.

625
00:53:08,184 --> 00:53:09,804
Where was he parish priest?

626
00:53:09,804 --> 00:53:11,244
Saint Peter's.

627
00:53:43,484 --> 00:53:46,724
Oh, oh, oh.

628
00:54:59,984 --> 00:55:01,944
His chest is...

629
00:55:01,944 --> 00:55:04,344
Red?

630
00:55:04,344 --> 00:55:06,344
You OK?

631
00:55:22,824 --> 00:55:24,604
Dad? Dad? It's Izzy.

632
00:55:29,384 --> 00:55:30,844
I need you to help me.

633
00:55:32,904 --> 00:55:34,364
Please, Dad.

634
00:55:38,264 --> 00:55:40,904
Answer me, Dad.

635
00:55:40,904 --> 00:55:42,884
Please, Daddy?

636
00:55:45,544 --> 00:55:47,324
Daddy.
