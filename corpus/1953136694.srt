It seem like only yesterday the
party would go on forever

3
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:43,510
but in just 12 short months the place
known as America's Spring Break Capital

4
00:00:43,535 --> 00:00:45,535
has become a virtual ghost town.

5
00:00:47,513 --> 00:00:51,506
Who can forget the devastating attack
on Lake Victoria that left scores of young

6
00:00:51,894 --> 00:00:54,528
people dead and a community
in shocked and who

7
00:00:54,529 --> 00:00:56,714
could've guess that
this hell on earth

8
00:00:56,739 --> 00:01:00,455
would be rocked by a species
of Piranha believed to be

9
00:01:00,456 --> 00:01:02,684
extinct for the 2 million years

10
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:07,673
A massive eradication program have left
these waters once teeming with life

11
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:13,233
silence and dead after a massive
exorcist most property abandoned

12
00:01:13,234 --> 00:01:14,632
the local economy

13
00:01:16,134 --> 00:01:21,824
fell in ruins. Lake Victoria is now a
quarantine area only weeds grow on

14
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:27,033
beaches where thousand once soaked-up
the sun and the only boats that remained

15
00:01:27,072 --> 00:01:29,855
are dusty relics littering the shoreline.

16
00:01:30,434 --> 00:01:34,878
As we look back from the anniversary
of this tragic event, we left to wonder

17
00:01:34,878 --> 00:01:37,964
if it happened here can it happen again?

18
00:01:37,989 --> 00:01:41,468
and if so, where?

19
00:03:52,587 --> 00:03:54,587
I got my foot stuck

20
00:04:08,783 --> 00:04:10,537
-There she is right there
-Is she dead?

21
00:04:23,314 --> 00:04:23,931
You got big

22
00:04:23,932 --> 00:04:26,397
Yeah, I took second place
in gunning last year

23
00:04:30,301 --> 00:04:36,700
Oh hell, it something around its belly,
find out whats going on down there

24
00:04:44,292 --> 00:04:46,292
There's something in there

25
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:57,060
-Holy-fine-baby-shit
-God-damn-piece-of-crap

26
00:04:57,085 --> 00:05:02,633
I got a lighter, that smell is awful

27
00:05:12,605 --> 00:05:14,605
That's just a gas you damn coward

28
00:05:26,981 --> 00:05:28,981
Shit! Shit! Shit!

29
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:40,714
Get away

30
00:06:31,255 --> 00:06:34,124
Hey, it's time to get wet again

31
00:06:35,494 --> 00:06:38,196
Come on down, all my girls are hot
and single

32
00:06:38,712 --> 00:06:40,988
and ready to party with someone like you

33
00:06:41,174 --> 00:06:43,337
-You!
-Put her down boys

34
00:06:44,678 --> 00:06:47,524
So, if you want to cool off, come
on down to the hottest hole in town

35
00:06:47,524 --> 00:06:50,664
3 words for you, THE BIG WET

36
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:55,024
Remember double D's swims free

37
00:07:00,717 --> 00:07:03,333
-Oh boy, hold on. Shut it!, shut it!
-Cut!

38
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,839
-Hey!
-Hai

39
00:07:14,655 --> 00:07:17,097
I've to cut some off the pass, here you go

40
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:18,280
Keep them wet

41
00:07:19,351 --> 00:07:22,071
-and are you guys friends of someone
-Maddy

42
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:24,931
Get over here and give your step dad a hug

43
00:07:25,783 --> 00:07:28,142
Chet, tell me you did
not fire our old

44
00:07:28,143 --> 00:07:30,985
life guards and replace
them with strippers

45
00:07:31,795 --> 00:07:34,055
-Water-certified strippers
-Really?

46
00:07:35,182 --> 00:07:36,281
-More than that pumpkin
-Unbelievable

47
00:07:36,281 --> 00:07:38,936
Hey listen, before you sweet
mother died God-bless her soul,

48
00:07:38,937 --> 00:07:41,432
she made me promised her to
keep this water park running

49
00:07:41,433 --> 00:07:43,652
I am just going to make
sure that I provide

50
00:07:43,652 --> 00:07:48,765
for you as well as she did, I'm your daddy
now, we're so lucky to have each other

51
00:07:50,355 --> 00:07:53,322
Wow Chet sometimes I think you really
believe whats coming out of your mouth

52
00:07:54,327 --> 00:07:57,305
Believe me doll, you're going to love this

53
00:07:59,216 --> 00:08:00,342
Adult pool?

54
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,405
We are going to make BIG on this

55
00:08:13,937 --> 00:08:16,927
-What do you think?
-I think this is very expensive joke

56
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:20,632
World's first strip club in a water
park, that's a stroke of genius

57
00:08:23,213 --> 00:08:23,922
No, no, no

58
00:08:23,923 --> 00:08:26,053
Oh, don't worry about that,
we put a little bit of

59
00:08:26,054 --> 00:08:27,681
chlorine, sulfuric
acid into the pool,

60
00:08:27,682 --> 00:08:28,774
it sanitizes everything

61
00:08:29,152 --> 00:08:32,352
Hey Kiki, why don't you get your ass out of the pool

62
00:08:34,836 --> 00:08:37,371
Russian, she's a doctor

63
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:41,309
Keep you eyes over there on the
flat screen TV

64
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:44,524
Check it out

65
00:08:48,511 --> 00:08:50,221
That is disgusting

66
00:08:50,226 --> 00:08:52,340
-Do not touch it
-I'm getting rid of it

67
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,466
Don't you touch it

68
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:54,793
That's not your call

69
00:08:54,793 --> 00:08:56,602
Don't you forget that i'm
still half owner of this place

70
00:08:57,349 --> 00:09:04,590
Oh! Is that right? Raise your hand if you
own 51% of this Water Park

71
00:09:04,614 --> 00:09:11,515
Now, raise your hand if your
49% minority on it, that's you

72
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,780
-Hey guys
-Hey Maddy

73
00:09:45,729 --> 00:09:46,772
How are you

74
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:50,214
Well this is a summer show
she finally obtained from accidents

75
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:50,723
Shut up!

76
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:56,535
She's afraid to have sex
because her slutty cousin

77
00:09:57,167 --> 00:09:58,001
Stop it!

78
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:04,403
Here he comes, the boy is going
to pop her cherry

79
00:10:04,428 --> 00:10:06,428
He just doesn't know it yet

80
00:10:06,453 --> 00:10:08,453
Stop it

81
00:10:08,478 --> 00:10:11,544
Hey Maddy, what do you 
think of all the changes around here?

82
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,055
-Josh meet Monique. Hi

00:10:17,145 --> 00:10:18,396

guy to know you're back?

84
00:10:18,479 --> 00:10:19,564

85
00:10:19,564 --> 00:10:21,694
-How are you?
-I miss you Me too

86
00:10:21,694 --> 00:10:24,586
Bet you wish you were in
grad school this summer huh?

87
00:10:24,777 --> 00:10:27,317
-I can't believe what Chet done
-I know

88
00:10:28,698 --> 00:10:32,075
This place is everything to me,
working here, hanging out

89
00:10:32,178 --> 00:10:33,554
I know, I miss those moments too

90
00:10:33,828 --> 00:10:34,913
So look now that you're back

91
00:10:34,913 --> 00:10:37,600
Hey you guys are you
sure that such a good idea?

92
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,499
Better not be any underage
drinking going on here

93
00:10:49,156 --> 00:10:51,714
Come on man, I'm on duty

94
00:10:54,249 --> 00:11:03,213
We got fireworks, decent exposure,
probable drugs, definite drugs

95
00:11:06,376 --> 00:11:08,128
Major had to rate you off

96
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:16,941
I don't see what he has that I don't have

97
00:11:16,966 --> 00:11:19,403
6 inches and a badge?

98
00:11:20,036 --> 00:11:24,678
I heard you're back in town so I
figured I stop by and say hi

99
00:11:24,998 --> 00:11:29,986
and I also feel that I should say
something about that time we talked

100
00:11:30,028 --> 00:11:33,302
You don't have to, long distance
relationship real.....

101
00:11:33,302 --> 00:11:35,457
-but you're back now
-For the summer

102
00:11:35,909 --> 00:11:38,787

109
00:12:08,055 --> 00:12:11,925
-What are you thinking about?
-Nothing much

110
00:12:14,335 --> 00:12:17,389
Lets take off all our clothes
and go swimming

111
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:21,198
Okay cool, sure

112
00:12:26,234 --> 00:12:29,579

-Are coming in or what?
-Yeah, I'm coming

117
00:13:03,018 --> 00:13:05,561
No funny stuff, okay?

118
00:13:16,401 --> 00:13:17,526
Alright

119
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:21,030
-What are you doing?
-You want some of this?

120
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,953
-You want some?
-You're not suppose to splash me back

121
00:13:38,076 --> 00:13:41,003
-What?
-I just felt something

122
00:13:41,847 --> 00:13:44,933
-Is that you?
-What are you talking about?

123
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,647
-What're you doing?
-I didn't

124
00:13:55,647 --> 00:13:59,299
-Well what ever it is I don't like it
-I didn't do anything

125
00:14:01,931 --> 00:14:05,211
-Shelby, where are you going?
-I'm cold, I'm getting out

126
00:14:16,514 --> 00:14:19,588
-You have to do it
-Okay fine

127
00:14:22,425 --> 00:14:25,018
Dear Lord,

128
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,932
-Come on
-Okay, dear Lord

129
00:14:30,053 --> 00:14:32,696
Please forgive us for what
we are about to do

130
00:14:33,064 --> 00:14:37,088
We each know that having relations
before marriages is a sin

131
00:14:37,099 --> 00:14:38,908
but

132
00:14:39,548 --> 00:14:42,970
We know that we'll be forgiven for it

133
00:14:43,457 --> 00:14:45,378
because...

134
00:14:45,772 --> 00:14:47,879
we're praying about it

135
00:14:48,469 --> 00:14:51,130
-Amen
-Amen

136
00:14:52,304 --> 00:14:55,198
-You can fuck me now
-Amen

137
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:58,535
-Look at this
-What?

138
00:14:59,393 --> 00:15:01,228
Do you like that?

139
00:15:06,731 --> 00:15:08,648
It's mine

140
00:15:10,525 --> 00:15:13,227
Don't make me cuff the other one

141
00:15:22,699 --> 00:15:24,825
-We're moving ,Travis
-I know

142
00:15:24,825 --> 00:15:26,653
-I know
-No

143
00:15:29,367 --> 00:15:31,580
Look, you idiot

144
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:41,742
-Ashley, are you okay?
-Yeah, the water coming in

145
00:15:43,323 --> 00:15:47,225
-Give me the key for the cuff
-Ah! It must have fallen out

146
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,043
-Find it now
-Where is it?

147
00:15:50,398 --> 00:15:52,157
Shit! Shit! Shit!

148
00:15:52,158 --> 00:15:53,088
Damn it!

149
00:15:58,105 --> 00:16:00,643
-Key for the damn cuff
-I should go for help

150
00:16:00,643 --> 00:16:02,427
-No
-I cannot see anything

151
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:03,088
I'm sorry

152
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:06,903
Ashley, hit the door light
and keep looking

153
00:16:08,306 --> 00:16:10,036

Travis

160
00:16:39,497 --> 00:16:40,968
Travis

161
00:16:42,295 --> 00:16:44,340
Help

162
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:48,723
There's something in the water

163
00:16:50,329 --> 00:16:54,318
Help! Anybody

164
00:17:01,181 --> 00:17:04,633
Ashley! Help!

165
00:17:05,381 --> 00:17:07,153
Travis, What's going on?

166
00:17:07,154 --> 00:17:08,261
Are you there?

167
00:17:08,296 --> 00:17:11,508
Travis! Travis!

168
00:17:13,831 --> 00:17:15,616
Ashley...

169
00:17:15,691 --> 00:17:17,866
Oh my God

170
00:17:18,315 --> 00:17:20,343

172
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,534
Anybody?

173
00:17:28,859 --> 00:17:32,362
-I am sorry, I'm just...
-No It's cool, I don't mind hanging out

174
00:17:32,673 --> 00:17:34,951
You know, it's not you, it's just that..

175
00:17:35,977 --> 00:17:38,870
Do you think that Ashley
is prettier than me

176
00:17:39,147 --> 00:17:41,570
-No
-Most guys do

177
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:45,514
Well I never liked girls with big breasts

178
00:18:28,061 --> 00:18:30,393
Welcome back Maddy

179
00:19:31,562 --> 00:19:33,589
-Dave
 -Yo man

180
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:37,025
-What the fuck are you doing?
-The hole where the water comes out

181
00:19:38,627 --> 00:19:41,418
-Oh God man
-It's so wet

182
00:19:46,531 --> 00:19:48,901
Hey Shelby, have you seen
Ashley or Travis?

183
00:19:49,001 --> 00:19:52,358
-Neither one of them punch in this morning
-No, I haven't seen either of them

184
00:19:53,307 --> 00:19:55,128
I don't know

185
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:56,745
Just a sec

186
00:19:57,224 --> 00:20:00,122
-You okay?
-I just feel a little weird

187
00:20:00,264 --> 00:20:01,418
-It's okay
-Here, let me help you

188
00:20:01,443 --> 00:20:03,443
No no I'm fine, really

189
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,909
Are you okay?

190
00:20:14,396 --> 00:20:17,806
Well look who has morning sickness

191
00:20:19,888 --> 00:20:22,686
Nice work papa

192
00:21:03,537 --> 00:21:05,788
Nobody was inside Shel

193
00:21:05,823 --> 00:21:09,525
-I'm sure they're just fine
-Probably shaken up and..

194
00:21:09,803 --> 00:21:12,449
scare they're going to get in trouble

195
00:21:13,093 --> 00:21:14,820
No

196
00:21:14,932 --> 00:21:16,765
Come on, Ash, pick up

197
00:21:16,765 --> 00:21:20,423
-Hello its Ash, leave a message
-Shit, call me

198
00:21:20,423 --> 00:21:22,528
Is there anywhere else
they might have gone?

199
00:21:22,528 --> 00:21:23,999
No, I don't think so

200
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,544
I'm just going to go

201
00:22:06,911 --> 00:22:09,211
Ashley is my best friend

202
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,503
I know she kinda of a slut

203
00:22:12,676 --> 00:22:15,996
She's still in love with my
ex-boyfriend

204
00:22:17,584 --> 00:22:19,811
I'm pretty sure she
also stole a pairs of

205
00:22:19,812 --> 00:22:21,826
earrings that my grandmother
gave me before she dies

206
00:22:22,318 --> 00:22:24,724
but we kinda like sisters

207
00:22:31,239 --> 00:22:32,997
What is that?

208
00:22:34,766 --> 00:22:35,963
Oh my God

209
00:22:36,137 --> 00:22:38,959
We have to get off this thing right now,
hurry

210
00:22:40,308 --> 00:22:42,454
Come on, Shelby

211
00:22:52,351 --> 00:22:53,877
Come on Shelby

212
00:22:53,878 --> 00:22:55,294
grab my hand

213
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:00,337
Alright, come on, I got you

214
00:23:00,951 --> 00:23:02,925
Oh my God, come on

215
00:23:03,336 --> 00:23:04,909
Oh my God

216
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:10,395
Quickly

217
00:23:12,648 --> 00:23:14,931
Lets go, we're almost there

218
00:23:28,964 --> 00:23:30,642
No, no, no

219
00:23:30,746 --> 00:23:32,227
Come back Shelby

220
00:23:32,228 --> 00:23:33,152
Come here

221
00:23:34,703 --> 00:23:37,041
You going to have to jump

222
00:23:41,042 --> 00:23:41,614
Come on

223
00:23:41,615 --> 00:23:43,740
You going to have to jump

224
00:23:43,775 --> 00:23:45,422
Let go

225
00:23:49,604 --> 00:23:51,362
Hurry it's just a foot

226
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:55,128
Alright, I got you

227
00:24:13,193 --> 00:24:14,777
Oh my god

228
00:24:35,594 --> 00:24:38,031
-What is this thing?
-Maddy?

229
00:24:38,218 --> 00:24:40,934
What the fuck is that?

230
00:24:56,038 --> 00:24:58,314
-Oh my God
-Shit

231
00:25:03,405 --> 00:25:06,286
-Is that a fucking Piranha?
-My father

232
00:25:06,496 --> 00:25:10,518
worked construction of a dam

233
00:25:10,553 --> 00:25:14,500
they found fossil like this
when they first broke ground

234
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:18,608
-He gave me on my birthday
-I telling you man it was a Piranha

235
00:25:18,648 --> 00:25:21,242
How did they get from
Lake Victoria to our lake?

236
00:25:21,242 --> 00:25:23,333
That what we got to find out

237
00:25:26,407 --> 00:25:27,922
What?

238
00:25:30,134 --> 00:25:34,422
Look at us the cop and the marine biologist

239
00:25:34,923 --> 00:25:37,566
I'm sorry but it sound
like a shitty sitcom

240
00:25:37,567 --> 00:25:40,498
The cop and the marine biologist

241
00:25:46,315 --> 00:25:48,486
You're still wet

242
00:25:49,684 --> 00:25:52,063
A little, yeah

243
00:26:28,596 --> 00:26:30,857
Can you open the door?

244
00:26:30,997 --> 00:26:32,872
Kyle, Open the door

245
00:26:33,476 --> 00:26:35,502
Just fooling around

246
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,101
It's funny

247
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,394
dick

248
00:26:46,307 --> 00:26:48,518
Who are you? Why are you here?

249
00:26:48,518 --> 00:26:50,345
Sir, we saw you on YouTube

250
00:26:50,345 --> 00:26:54,695
You and 11,486,000 other people

251
00:26:54,878 --> 00:26:59,704
I have 700 more hits than
the laughing diarrhea baby

252
00:27:00,322 --> 00:27:03,094
We need your expertise
Mr. Goodman

253
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,443
Why?

254
00:27:07,588 --> 00:27:09,846
We think they're back

255
00:27:16,295 --> 00:27:19,742
Cross Lake isn't even connected
to Lake Victoria

256
00:27:19,742 --> 00:27:24,699
The Piranha must be migrating
through underground lakes and rivers

257
00:27:25,225 --> 00:27:29,453
I have studied this specimen
for almost a year

258
00:27:32,409 --> 00:27:34,241
You evil

259
00:27:39,148 --> 00:27:42,568
I think you might find this interesting

260
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:49,618
Okay, this is galvanized steel

261
00:27:49,672 --> 00:27:54,441
like ordinary household plumbing

262
00:27:55,003 --> 00:27:57,117
there we go

263
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,832
now with some incentive

264
00:28:02,737 --> 00:28:06,299
-No, no, not the Frog
-Sorry

265
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:09,785
I sold out of puppies as a boy

266
00:28:11,808 --> 00:28:15,481
Now I think this is
quite resourceful

267
00:28:15,482 --> 00:28:16,399
watch

268
00:28:41,347 --> 00:28:44,554
Now just something to grab

269
00:28:54,195 --> 00:28:56,331
-You fuck
-Barry, are you crazy?

270
00:28:56,331 --> 00:28:59,672
-You almost lost a hand
-I had a pet frog once

271
00:29:02,094 --> 00:29:05,321
-Come on, help me
-Really?

272
00:29:06,642 --> 00:29:10,683
-Now, lets check some data
-What're you thinking?

273
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:23,883
These Piranha spent eons
living in underground

274
00:29:23,883 --> 00:29:28,228
lake and rivers full of sulfur dioxide

275
00:29:28,228 --> 00:29:30,744
from all the geothermal activity

276
00:29:30,745 --> 00:29:33,575
that's how they
come back to spore

277
00:29:33,957 --> 00:29:36,874
-They follow the rotten eggs smell
-Yes

278
00:29:37,825 --> 00:29:41,018
Problem is sulfur dioxide is

279
00:29:41,018 --> 00:29:45,840
commonly released during the
shipment of chlorinating water

280
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:51,539
So its inconceivable that the
fish could become confused

281
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:55,652
and to enter man-made drainage systems

282
00:29:55,949 --> 00:30:02,193
especially with those shocking
abundance of back yard pools

283
00:30:04,915 --> 00:30:07,207
Our water park drain
directly into Cross lake

284
00:30:07,498 --> 00:30:09,697
That's like equivalent to thousands
of swimming pools

285
00:30:09,697 --> 00:30:12,145
That would be a very bad thing

286
00:30:12,145 --> 00:30:14,585
Did you tell anyone that this could happen?

287
00:30:14,585 --> 00:30:17,137
I tried, but unfortunately

288
00:30:17,137 --> 00:30:20,867
I lost some credibility after my last book
"Foretold Dreadful..

289
00:30:20,867 --> 00:30:23,835
Plague of Walking Fish"

290
00:30:23,915 --> 00:30:27,121
Oh that’s right, you
wrote fish walk among us

291
00:30:27,121 --> 00:30:28,498
I loved that book

292
00:30:28,499 --> 00:30:30,198
This is really great

293
00:30:31,055 --> 00:30:35,339
Well thank you

294
00:30:44,702 --> 00:30:46,387
Thanks

295
00:30:47,101 --> 00:30:48,694
Barry

296
00:30:49,353 --> 00:30:52,765
You read a marine biology book?

297
00:30:52,977 --> 00:30:55,788
Well I want to see what
you so interested in

298
00:30:59,372 --> 00:31:02,379
Look guys, we got to check the drains
of the outflow pipe to the lake

299
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,131
tonight

300
00:31:03,259 --> 00:31:05,631
I could get a dive team up here
of 10 people by tomorrow

301
00:31:05,631 --> 00:31:06,741
No, that's too late.

302
00:31:06,742 --> 00:31:08,406
The water park opens tomorrow

303
00:31:08,406 --> 00:31:10,791
That place is going to be packed

304
00:31:10,826 --> 00:31:12,704
if the fishes are getting through
the drain system

305
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:16,547
that would make Lake Victoria
look like an appetizer

306
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,772
Guys we got to get out there right now

307
00:31:20,232 --> 00:31:22,664
Thank you so much for
your help Mr. Goodman

308
00:31:22,665 --> 00:31:23,327
Thank you

309
00:31:23,327 --> 00:31:27,688
-Thank you, sir, It's an honor
-Okay, be well

310
00:31:31,911 --> 00:31:35,389
11,888,000 hits

311
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:40,213
Take that laughing diarrhea baby

312
00:32:06,239 --> 00:32:09,252
The two teen Ashley Sowerby
and Travis Mitchell

313
00:32:09,252 --> 00:32:12,089
were reported missing this morning
after their van was pull out of

314
00:32:12,089 --> 00:32:14,100
Cross Lake. No bodies were found

315
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,492
-Thanks for letting me stay here
-No, it was totally cool

316
00:32:18,434 --> 00:32:20,146
How are you felling?

317
00:32:20,297 --> 00:32:22,961
-A little better
-You don't seem any better

318
00:32:24,418 --> 00:32:25,313
Hey what is it?

319
00:32:25,314 --> 00:32:28,118
It just this stress of
the whole Ashley thing

320
00:32:33,496 --> 00:32:36,629
Make love to me

321
00:32:37,245 --> 00:32:40,127
-Please
-Right now?

322
00:32:40,127 --> 00:32:43,541
Please Josh, right now

323
00:32:44,204 --> 00:32:47,174
I think something is really
wrong with me

324
00:32:48,378 --> 00:32:49,912
I feel a little bit better

325
00:32:49,913 --> 00:32:51,622
I don't want to die a virgin

326
00:32:54,551 --> 00:32:58,228
Josh, I want to be with you

327
00:33:04,094 --> 00:33:08,167
Come inside me. I'll do what
ever you said after that

328
00:33:10,872 --> 00:33:13,115
The outflow pipe down there
lead directly to the water park

329
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,049
I got to check them out

330
00:33:14,049 --> 00:33:16,849
Considering how bad-crazy this is, right?

331
00:33:16,849 --> 00:33:18,575
I got to take a look

332
00:33:18,576 --> 00:33:19,783
I'll be quick

333
00:33:20,683 --> 00:33:22,977
Look about what I'm
trying to say last night

334
00:33:22,977 --> 00:33:24,815
Are you coming in?
Because I could really use a spotter

335
00:33:24,966 --> 00:33:26,820
-What?
-I mean if you're

336
00:33:27,104 --> 00:33:29,836
-It's okay
-No no I'm not scared

337
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:33,506
I can't swim

338
00:33:33,506 --> 00:33:36,222
You work in the water park
and you can't swim?

339
00:33:37,236 --> 00:33:40,929
What about all the beach parties in
high school or the parties at the park

340
00:33:40,929 --> 00:33:42,982
You never

341
00:33:42,994 --> 00:33:45,073
My god Barry, I totally would've
taught how to swim

342
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:48,248
I know, you seemed kinda
busy at the time

343
00:33:49,509 --> 00:33:51,474
not a big deal

344
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:54,342
Toss me that torch light

345
00:33:55,243 --> 00:33:57,284
Yes, I know, that is
what I said Chet

346
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,660
Chet Chet listen

347
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,092
I'll find you

348
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:10,050
Are you sure you want to do this?

349
00:34:10,184 --> 00:34:12,026
No

350
00:34:50,498 --> 00:34:54,214
You let her go in there alone?

351
00:34:54,904 --> 00:34:59,734
-Fuck off Connor
-Oh yes, Barry can't swim

352
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:23,169
Maddy

353
00:35:23,342 --> 00:35:25,476
-Maddy
-Maddy

354
00:35:26,928 --> 00:35:28,900
Dive, Maddy

355
00:35:30,136 --> 00:35:31,409
No

356
00:35:44,279 --> 00:35:46,246
-Shit
-Get out of the away, get back

357
00:35:54,859 --> 00:35:58,019
-Are you okay?
-I think so

358
00:36:04,025 --> 00:36:05,723
Yes

359
00:36:07,102 --> 00:36:10,050
Don't worry, I wont break

360
00:36:12,619 --> 00:36:15,085
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry
-No, It's ok

361
00:36:15,202 --> 00:36:17,993
I like it. Keep going

362
00:36:20,391 --> 00:36:22,921
-Oh god Shelby
-Fuck me

363
00:36:27,693 --> 00:36:29,979
Oh my God, yes

364
00:36:30,019 --> 00:36:31,587
-Oh my God
-Oh my God

365
00:36:31,587 --> 00:36:34,181
-Come on
-Oh my God

366
00:36:35,816 --> 00:36:38,052
-Oh my God
-Something's wrong

367
00:36:38,922 --> 00:36:40,862
-Oh my god
-Something's wrong

368
00:36:40,862 --> 00:36:43,368
Almost there, almost there

369
00:36:46,487 --> 00:36:48,450
Fuck

370
00:36:48,908 --> 00:36:51,734
What the fuck is on my dick?

371
00:36:51,966 --> 00:36:53,751
Oh my God

372
00:36:53,969 --> 00:36:55,657
Oh my God

373
00:36:56,698 --> 00:36:59,150
Damn, what's this?

374
00:36:59,861 --> 00:37:02,015
Damn it

375
00:37:02,941 --> 00:37:04,970
Oh my God

376
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:17,135
This is disgusting

377
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:26,874
Oh Jesus

378
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,107
Josh

379
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:47,361
I feeling a little better now, Josh?

380
00:37:47,693 --> 00:37:49,737
Josh

381
00:37:50,277 --> 00:37:52,166
Josh

382
00:37:53,927 --> 00:37:56,654
I think I had an accident

383
00:37:58,917 --> 00:38:00,775
Josh

384
00:38:08,964 --> 00:38:11,071
Josh,  what are you doing?

385
00:38:13,362 --> 00:38:15,158
Oh my God

386
00:38:26,744 --> 00:38:28,591
Josh

387
00:38:29,493 --> 00:38:31,654
Josh

388
00:38:32,832 --> 00:38:34,733
Josh

389
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:36,371
Josh

390
00:38:37,768 --> 00:38:39,511
Josh

391
00:38:40,761 --> 00:38:43,940
What the hell did you do to me?

392
00:39:02,946 --> 00:39:04,527
You're going seventy
miles there buddy

393
00:39:04,528 --> 00:39:06,352
Don't you have some place
else better to be?

394
00:39:06,352 --> 00:39:09,484
-Like boning my step daughter
-I'll get to that

395
00:39:09,484 --> 00:39:11,858
First thing first

396
00:39:23,415 --> 00:39:27,643
-You're all good, for now
-Well you're looking for a raise?

397
00:39:27,643 --> 00:39:29,743
With any luck your little
theme park is going

398
00:39:29,744 --> 00:39:32,436
to take off and i'm going to
live off deputy salary forever

399
00:39:32,718 --> 00:39:35,718
So, we're good here?

400
00:39:35,718 --> 00:39:38,413
Yeah, did you check those
outflow pipe at the lake?

401
00:39:38,414 --> 00:39:39,087
Maddy did

402
00:39:39,394 --> 00:39:40,624
She almost got herself killed

403
00:39:40,625 --> 00:39:42,511
How about the grades,
they're still intact?

404
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:46,028
Should be good, unless there
are another way in the park

405
00:39:46,028 --> 00:39:49,033
-Like that boot leg weld you drilled
-Don't you worry about that

406
00:39:49,033 --> 00:39:50,307
I do worry Chet

407
00:39:50,308 --> 00:39:52,854
I'm the one protecting your unlawful ass

408
00:39:53,415 --> 00:39:55,398
Let me tell you something

409
00:39:55,436 --> 00:39:59,030
Why don't you worry keeping Maddy
and Johnny law off my ass

410
00:39:59,181 --> 00:40:01,946
-I'll take care of my Water Park
-Okay

411
00:40:02,195 --> 00:40:05,439
-Have a nice night deputy
-You too Chet

412
00:40:05,561 --> 00:40:08,644
-Oh by the way
-What in the hell is this?

413
00:40:08,644 --> 00:40:11,137
-I told you were speeding
-Are you shitting me?

414
00:40:11,172 --> 00:40:13,402
Just doing my job

415
00:40:14,917 --> 00:40:17,247
You're a crooked cop

416
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:33,128
What a night huh

417
00:40:33,835 --> 00:40:35,500
So um..

418
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,740
You an Kyle, I guess you
get back together

419
00:40:38,974 --> 00:40:41,482
No, definitely not

420
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:44,793
I don't think so, probably not

421
00:40:46,195 --> 00:40:48,736
must be hard to make that decision

422
00:40:48,916 --> 00:40:51,177
Kinda did, didn't I

423
00:40:54,052 --> 00:40:57,575
Josh cut off his penis because
something came out of my vagina

424
00:41:00,953 --> 00:41:04,735
Should we coming too short the
nurses are going to take you guys back

425
00:41:06,001 --> 00:41:09,355
You guys can probably go
Josh is still sedated

426
00:41:09,355 --> 00:41:11,798
and I'm going to stick
around to take a statement

427
00:41:11,799 --> 00:41:14,094
I'll let you you guys
know if I found anything out

428
00:41:14,394 --> 00:41:15,176
How's Shelby?

429
00:41:15,177 --> 00:41:18,001
She's not making a lot
of sense right now but

430
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:19,639
I'll keep an eye on her too

431
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,024
How about you, you alright?

432
00:41:21,024 --> 00:41:22,848
I'm pretty tired

433
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:25,345
Get some rest and I'll call you

434
00:43:54,836 --> 00:43:58,741
I'm a Love Hunter, hear what I say

435
00:43:59,229 --> 00:44:02,922
Get on your knees learn how to play

436
00:44:03,068 --> 00:44:08,198
Cause a Love Hunter is coming
to take you away

437
00:44:08,443 --> 00:44:13,650
Love Hunter coming today

438
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:16,495
That is so sad

439
00:44:17,226 --> 00:44:20,052
Come to bed, Hoffy
It's nappy time

440
00:44:20,512 --> 00:44:24,514
I'm a Love Hunter hear what I'll say

441
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:28,514
Looks like Donna is ready to play

442
00:44:28,514 --> 00:44:31,046
I'm Rachel

443
00:44:31,227 --> 00:44:33,634
-I'm Donna
-Right

444
00:44:35,948 --> 00:44:37,868
I'm a love Hunter

445
00:44:37,869 --> 00:44:40,014
Two chicks for me

446
00:44:40,014 --> 00:44:44,117
because I am the brightest stars on TV

447
00:44:44,412 --> 00:44:47,004
Yeah, lets party

448
00:45:08,043 --> 00:45:10,106
Welcome to Rock Bottom

449
00:45:15,084 --> 00:45:18,345
Sorry, can you get this thing open?

450
00:45:29,521 --> 00:45:30,917
Wait

451
00:45:39,352 --> 00:45:41,072
I do not know if I can do this

452
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:45,110
All you is keep baby steps,
little baby steps

453
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:47,867
What the hell are talking
about baby steps for?

454
00:45:48,095 --> 00:45:51,241
In case you haven't know
fish ate my damn legs

455
00:45:51,242 --> 00:45:52,592
I hate water, I hate it

456
00:45:52,593 --> 00:45:54,705
Remember what
doctor Smith's said

457
00:45:54,705 --> 00:45:59,964
This is all about the road to recovery
strut out with harmless little kiddy pool

458
00:46:00,417 --> 00:46:02,098
I mean, what the worst
that could happen

459
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:03,862
Couple of kids will
do to you, that's all

460
00:46:04,888 --> 00:46:06,540
Kids...

461
00:46:07,803 --> 00:46:10,103
I can handle that

462
00:46:22,296 --> 00:46:24,958
I'm not afraid of some punk-ass water

463
00:46:25,327 --> 00:46:28,318
I'm not afraid of some punk-ass water

464
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:32,683
I can't

465
00:46:32,684 --> 00:46:35,993
Don't worry about it, we'll
figure out something else

466
00:46:36,028 --> 00:46:37,497
No, this is weak

467
00:46:38,109 --> 00:46:40,638
-Dump me in the water
-What?

468
00:46:40,638 --> 00:46:44,100
You heard what I said, get
behind the seat, grab the handles

469
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,812
and dump my sorry ass in the water

470
00:46:46,812 --> 00:46:48,710
The way the parent toss
their kid into the pool

471
00:46:48,711 --> 00:46:49,659
when they want to swim

472
00:46:49,659 --> 00:46:51,174
This is a great idea

473
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:52,841
Alright I can do this

474
00:46:52,841 --> 00:46:55,062
-One, two
-Stop

475
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:57,933
-Okay okay right, what happened?
-Why you stop?

476
00:46:58,378 --> 00:47:01,032
-You said stop
-Don't listen to my pussy-ass-mouth

477
00:47:01,032 --> 00:47:03,474
No matter what I'll say,
dump me into the water

478
00:47:03,475 --> 00:47:04,085
Okay got it

479
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:06,086
Not going to listen to
your pussy-ass-mouth

480
00:47:06,087 --> 00:47:07,873
I mean you don't have
a pussy-ass-mouth

481
00:47:07,874 --> 00:47:09,153
Dump me in the water

482
00:47:09,153 --> 00:47:12,125
Okay, here we go
One, two..

483
00:47:12,125 --> 00:47:14,228
Ah shit, no no I changed my mind

484
00:47:14,229 --> 00:47:15,477
No, no you're going in

485
00:47:15,477 --> 00:47:17,653
I changed my mind, I don't
want to go in the water

486
00:47:17,653 --> 00:47:19,658
I don't want to go in the water

487
00:47:19,659 --> 00:47:20,159
-You're going in
-Hey

488
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:21,275
Leave him alone

489
00:47:21,276 --> 00:47:23,134
No no he wants to go in

490
00:47:23,134 --> 00:47:23,955
No, no the hell I do

491
00:47:23,956 --> 00:47:25,344
I don't want to go in

492
00:47:25,344 --> 00:47:28,607
What's wrong with you? Don't push
that poor legless stump in the pool

493
00:47:28,607 --> 00:47:31,538
Yeah, that's right don't push this
poor legless stump in the pool

494
00:47:31,538 --> 00:47:34,878
Okay, you know what, you
going to go in the water....

495
00:47:34,879 --> 00:47:36,093
No, I don’t want to go

496
00:47:39,338 --> 00:47:40,339
Not cool man

497
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:43,510
I'm not afraid of
some punk-ass-water

498
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:45,872
Not cool at all

499
00:47:52,943 --> 00:47:55,370
Ladies and gentlemen
Boys and girls

500
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:58,770
Hot moms of all ages

501
00:47:58,771 --> 00:48:01,118
Welcome to the BIG WET

502
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:08,832

00:48:08,998 --> 00:48:13,242
The most famous life
guard of all time

00:48:13,242 --> 00:48:17,592
Who wants to party

505
00:48:17,593 --> 00:48:20,662
Welcome David Hasselhoff

506
00:48:30,014 --> 00:48:32,009
David Hasselhoff

507
00:48:32,374 --> 00:48:32,995
Ladies

508
00:48:32,996 --> 00:48:35,481
You know ladies if you
play your card right

509
00:48:35,695 --> 00:48:39,269
You may get private
mouth to mouth resuscitation

510
00:48:41,087 --> 00:48:43,860
Alright without any further a do

511
00:48:44,313 --> 00:48:48,530
Lets all get wet and wild

512
00:48:51,661 --> 00:48:55,075
How are you doing? feeling good?

513
00:48:58,477 --> 00:49:02,549
Come here, gorgeous, my dear

514
00:49:03,627 --> 00:49:07,356
You're beautiful, you're beautiful

515
00:49:07,391 --> 00:49:10,877
kiss of life

516
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:23,464
Goodbye now

517
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:44,729
I knew it

518
00:49:45,518 --> 00:49:47,816
What are you doing back here Maddy?

519
00:49:48,502 --> 00:49:50,544
I saw this when I was taking inventory but

520
00:49:50,544 --> 00:49:52,679
But I didn't think to ask why
it's here until now

521
00:49:52,679 --> 00:49:55,348
Well we pumping our own water now
fuck the utilities right?

522
00:49:55,348 --> 00:49:57,840
You can't fill this
Water Park off a well

523
00:49:57,841 --> 00:49:59,169
It's not a standard well

524
00:49:59,578 --> 00:50:02,837
We drilled down a whole lot
further hit an underwater lake

525
00:50:03,088 --> 00:50:05,081
We got enough water
to last until forever

526
00:50:05,082 --> 00:50:06,695
You have no idea
what you've done

527
00:50:06,695 --> 00:50:09,440
 Oh sure I did, got us a
nice big fat profit

528
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,767
You don't understand,
you could be

529
00:50:10,768 --> 00:50:12,814
pumping out Piranhas straight
through the water intake pipes

530
00:50:12,814 --> 00:50:14,457
Maddy, its opening day

531
00:50:14,458 --> 00:50:17,892
I have shelled out a
hundred thousand dollars

532
00:50:17,892 --> 00:50:21,389
And you want me to close shop
because there might

533
00:50:21,389 --> 00:50:24,829
Might be Piranha in the pipe.
What else?

534
00:50:24,829 --> 00:50:28,629
Ghosts? Boogieman? Sharks? Snakes?

535
00:50:28,629 --> 00:50:33,493
You're laughable. Laughable
Come on kid..

536
00:50:34,199 --> 00:50:36,376
You been watching too

A woman saw a Piranha

00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:36,086

00:53:49,827 --> 00:53:52,694
-Lets just go check things up okay?
-You don't believe me

583
00:53:52,910 --> 00:53:56,094
I'm the one who called you

584
00:53:56,290 --> 00:53:59,103
Come on kids get out of the pool,

Help, help, help me

00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:13,935
Heffy, people are dying
You're a life guard, do something

605
00:57:14,066 --> 00:57:16,028
I'm not a life guard, never was one

606
00:57:16,028 --> 00:57:20,621
Help, help me, help

607
00:57:21,106 --> 00:57:25,253
-When are you going to help?
-Once these idiots get out of the water

608
00:57:25,527 --> 00:57:28,488
Its not like the fish are
going to follow them home

609
00:57:28,689 --> 00:57:31,665

611
00:57:40,213 --> 00:57:45,087
You went back into the water,

612
00:57:45,913 --> 00:57:49,288
Heffy, you're a life guard man

615
00:58:22,396 --> 00:58:24,784
I'm here to rescue

616
00:58:24,784 --> 00:58:28,515
I actually am doing the rescue

617
00:58:29,518 --> 00:58:31,753
Can you put me down now?

618
00:58:52,934 --> 00:58:54,608
Chet

619
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:57,333

You see them? You see them now?

621
00:59:04,106 --> 00:59:05,974
We got to drain the pool

622
00:59:11,096 --> 00:59:12,331
Hey Barry, Barry

623
00:59:12,331 --> 00:59:14,446
I need you to go and pump out
and force drain a pool

624

625
00:59:15,909 --> 00:59:17,993

levers, they are down

626
