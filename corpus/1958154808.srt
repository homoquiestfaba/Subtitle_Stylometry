Alexandra

421
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,124
I heard you study philosophy.

422
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:12,166
What got you hooked?

423
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,250
The

424
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:15,083
this might sound
a little bit weird but

425
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:17,124
when I was in kindergarten I was

426
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,749
diagnosed with ADHD
it's made me think

427
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,142
and feel differently
from the other kids

428
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:24,208
in my grade this
inspired me to sort of

429
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,333
figure out why the
world made me this

430
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:27,249
way

431
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:30,124
one of the benefits
of having ADHD other

432
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:31,958
than being really
hyper is that you get

433
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,749
fixated on these things

434
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:36,749
small things I got
fixed on reading

435
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:39,749
books different
books about different

436
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,226
people's views on
the world and it sort

437
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,374
of made me realise
like Jim Morrison

438
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:46,208
would say that I was

439
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,124
thrown into the
world this way which

440
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:52,208
made it my destiny
to be a philosopher

441
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,375
what about you Alex? [Laughing]

442
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,333

[Heavy breathing] I
go to York for psych

450
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:12,083
I guess to why I
chose a screw path

451
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,142
that's because you
only needed to see in

452
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,124
high school to
get in but I'm in a

453
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:18,125

You know how some time you
have one bite and you just can't stop

743
00:36:14,458 --> 00:36:15,684
I guess that's kind
of what happened

744
00:36:15,708 --> 00:36:17,666
last night

745
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:20,249
but don't worry
you're self-deprecating

it totally under

control

748
00:36:23,916 --> 00:36:27,374
I just need to outrun
my fuck up just

749
00:36:27,416 --> 00:36:30,791
not eat today then
I will be healthy and

750
00:36:30,833 --> 00:36:33,416
optimistic and
positive and shit.

751
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:34,624

Lord Voldemort on
the toilet that could work

756
00:37:11,083 --> 00:37:14,666
but how am I going
to hide his nose?

757
00:37:14,708 --> 00:37:17,749
Also he needs to be shaved

758
00:37:17,791 --> 00:37:18,833
anyway

759
00:37:19,041 --> 00:37:20,666
Uh...

760

that was something

761
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:25,999
I didn't know I
could write so many

762
00:37:26,041 --> 00:37:28,999
stories in less than
an hour it has the

763
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:31,291
potential to be a nice

764
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:34,458
pattern the brain
not only receives

765
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,083
information but
also interprets and

766
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:41,624
patterns it I can
tell I'm pleased with

something unpleasant

lies at the bottom
of your stomach.

772
