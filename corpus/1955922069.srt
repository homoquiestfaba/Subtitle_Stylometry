00:00:42,983 --> 00:00:47,794
Cirque du Soleil

2
00:00:54,174 --> 00:00:58,353
Journey of Man

3
00:03:01,368 --> 00:03:04,765
I don't remember how it all began

4
00:03:04,872 --> 00:03:08,310
...and I had no idea
where it would end.

5
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:11,940
I only knew feelings

6
00:03:12,127 --> 00:03:14,609
sensations

7
00:03:17,425 --> 00:03:20,823
And so began my journey.

8
00:07:09,117 --> 00:07:13,345
I was born with only instincts
as my guides.

9
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,183
And I knew them
when they came to me

10
00:07:38,813 --> 00:07:42,917
In those childhood days
they never left my side.

11
00:07:43,024 --> 00:07:44,963
They were all I knew.

12
00:07:45,109 --> 00:07:47,466
and all I needed.

13
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,990
I 'm not sure if I saw these things

14
00:09:37,095 --> 00:09:39,160
or dreamed them

15
00:09:39,431 --> 00:09:42,079
But true or imagined.

16
00:09:42,226 --> 00:09:44,873
they filled my heart with joy.

17
00:09:54,658 --> 00:09:59,511
Then one day I learned that joy
has a friend called fear.

18
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:26,036
But my faithful instincts showed me
that with fear comes courage.

19
00:10:27,148 --> 00:10:31,709
And courage has another friend,
called wonder.

20
00:14:04,699 --> 00:14:09,427
In my youth, there were
many tracks and few signposts

21
00:14:09,535 --> 00:14:12,099
But I was young and bold.

22
00:14:12,205 --> 00:14:15,435
...and on my way
to new adventures

23
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:37,832
My childhood fantasies
were behind me now.

24
00:14:38,816 --> 00:14:43,295
Ahead lay many
mysteries and marvels

25
00:18:17,325 --> 00:18:20,345
I had outgrown
my childhood guides

26
00:18:20,453 --> 00:18:23,682
I knew I could be
strong and daring

27
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:27,060
I was a young man
with a young man's dreams

28
00:18:27,167 --> 00:18:29,022
Everything was possible

29
00:18:29,129 --> 00:18:31,898
...as I raced along
on my great adventure

30
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:40,485
Then one day I stopped
my headstrong rush and paused.

31
00:20:41,387 --> 00:20:44,739
Like standing
on the shoreline of a dream

32
00:20:46,516 --> 00:20:50,328
...I sensed a power
that I couldn't explain

33
00:22:04,175 --> 00:22:06,240
Then it came to me

34
00:22:06,344 --> 00:22:07,824
When I became a man

35
00:22:07,974 --> 00:22:12,284
I learned that harmony and union
make each of us complete.

36
00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:17,417
And I saw its name was love

37
00:26:29,609 --> 00:26:33,837
It was time to act like a man
make a deal.

38
00:26:34,281 --> 00:26:39,551
Wealth and power could buy me
all the love I needed.

39
00:27:13,028 --> 00:27:17,881
I no longer needed childhood
fantasies and youthful dreams

40
00:27:17,991 --> 00:27:22,637
I had found love
and had to own its secret.

41
00:27:37,427 --> 00:27:40,863
As a man,
I had achieved my goals

42
00:27:40,971 --> 00:27:44,452
My journey had been a success

43
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,748
And yet.

44
00:27:47,855 --> 00:27:51,749
sometimes, distant memories
returned to haunt me.

45
00:27:52,525 --> 00:27:57,088
Childhood visitations
of half-forgotten friends

46
00:27:58,867 --> 00:28:03,676
And occasionally doubts and troubles
invaded my seclusion.

47
00:33:15,346 --> 00:33:19,244
In that moment, time fell away.

48
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:22,456
My years turned to dust.

49
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:26,586
I was young again

50
00:33:47,964 --> 00:33:51,859
Now I remembered
where I began my journey.

51
00:33:52,466 --> 00:33:55,614
As a child full of dreams

52
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,620
full of faith

53
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,791
and full of love

54
00:34:06,565 --> 00:34:10,962
At last my journey
could be completed.

55
00:34:48,735 --> 00:34:54,087
Each of you was born with three keys
to the doors of your journey.

56
00:34:54,237 --> 00:34:57,510
The first is for your dreams

57
00:34:57,617 --> 00:35:01,512
It lets you make
the impossible possible

58
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:04,016
The second is for your faith

59
00:35:04,122 --> 00:35:07,520
It tells you to believe in youth

60
00:35:08,293 --> 00:35:11,732
And above all, the third is for love

61
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,108
...the instinct
to respect each other

62
00:35:14,256 --> 00:35:17,530
Dreams, faith and love

63
00:35:17,636 --> 00:35:21,532
With these three,
anything is possible

64
00:35:22,808 --> 00:35:27,914
It is your journey,
but it is our destination
