1
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,871
-<i> It's getting late, officer.</i>

2
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:58,310
-<i> Sheriff, you gotta</i>
<i> get down here.</i>

3
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,677
-<i> We got an ID on her?</i>

4
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:33,111
-<i> No, sir.</i>

5
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:34,446
<i>No relation to Paul and Carol.</i>

6
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:40,652
- Who's she?

7
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:43,722
- Well, for now,
she's a Jane Doe.

8
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:47,593
You got something?

9
00:03:47,595 --> 00:03:49,061
- Nothing was stolen.

10
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:50,796
Not a scratch on the outside
of the house either.

11
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:54,466
Doesn't look like
someone broke in.

12
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:57,069
To me, it looks like
they were trying to break out.

13
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:06,331
- Cause of death?

14
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,234
- How about we
skip this part tonight?

15
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:12,070
- Come on,
this one's a soft ball.

16
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:16,975
- Smoke inhalation.

17
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:20,746
- You're telling me
that smoke killed Mr. Howard?

18
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:23,348
- Well, damaged nasal passage

19
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,450
damaged throat, damaged lungs..

20
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:27,052
- Damaged lungs, yes.

21
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:29,654
But incompatible with life.

22
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:31,022
- So, you're saying
that's not the COD?

23
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:33,625
- I'm saying
look before you leap.

24
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,296
Where did the police
find the body?

25
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:40,465
- Uh, in his kitchen.

26
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:43,301
- House on fire.
Front door is 30 feet away

27
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:44,836
<i> yet, he's not</i>
<i> trying to get there.</i>

28
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:46,805
Lungs are damaged

29
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:49,408
but airways not denuded
nearly enough.

30
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:52,878
- So, he stopped breathing

31
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,513
before that fire
really got going?

32
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:58,116
- Open him up.

33
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,388
Now.

34
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,523
Now you see here?

35
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:07,359
Down below the occipital.
- A fracture.

36
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,163
- That explains the swelling
in his brain.

37
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:13,765
- Subdural hematoma.

38
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,701
That's what did it.
Not the smoke.

39
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:20,605
Everybody has a secret.

40
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,108
Some just hide them
better than others.

41
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,211
- Some people are better
at finding them.

42
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:28,413
- You did good.
You'll get there.

43
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:35,187
- Nobody's even
claimed him yet.

44
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:36,688
He was all alone,
that's why he died.

45
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,990
- He died because
he fell and hit his head.

46
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:46,131
You got plans tonight?

47
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,300
- Emma wants to go
see a movie at the strand.

48
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:52,270
- I thought they'd closed
that place down.

49
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:54,172
- Uh, no, when was
the last time

50
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:55,874
you even went to go
see a movie, dad?

51
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,146
- Uh, she has Alzheimer's

52
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:04,349
and he's building her a house.

53
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:06,852
- The notebook?

54
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:09,488
- Oh, yeah, your mother made me
go and see it with her

55
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,289
for her birthday.

56
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,624
I fell asleep five minutes in.

57
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:18,263
Yeah.

58
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:19,731
Are you alright finishing up?

59
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:20,966
- Yeah.

60
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,005
What's up, tilden?

61
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,940
Hematoma.

62
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:51,556
Stanley.

63
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,960
Oh.

64
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:00,865
Hey, dad!

65
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:02,334
Stanley got another one.

66
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:13,678
Dad?

67
00:10:57,924 --> 00:10:59,457
Jesus Christ!

68
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,393
- It's so easy!

69
00:11:01,395 --> 00:11:02,494
- How'd you get down here?

70
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:03,828
- The key was in the elevator.

71
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,297
- Oh, my god.

72
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:09,601
- I gotta say, this is not
what I was expecting.

73
00:11:09,603 --> 00:11:12,370
You said it was old
but wow.

74
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:14,673
- I thought we were supposed
to meet out front.

75
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:16,741
- Well, I got tired of waiting.

76
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:18,643
- Where, where are you going?

77
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:20,578
- I'm having a little look.

78
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,313
-<i> Come back.</i>

79
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:24,449
-<i> God, the place</i>
<i> just keeps going.</i>

80
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:27,285
-<i> Well, three generations</i>
<i> of tildens keep expanding</i>

81
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:29,821
<i> end up with this</i>
<i> state-of-the-art facility.</i>

82
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:32,190
Hey, come on.

83
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,792
- What's the rush?

84
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:35,427
- I've been down here all day.

85
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:41,933
- You got to see me at my job,
why can't I see you at yours?

86
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:43,368
-<i> You work at a book store.</i>

87
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:58,917
- Are these all people?

88
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,218
-<i> Just three tonight.</i>

89
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:03,555
- Can I see one?

90
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:06,357
- Well, no. No.
You cannot see one.

91
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:07,392
- Why not?

92
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,728
- Because there's --

93
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,930
some things you can't
un-see, okay?

94
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:13,398
- Come on, I can handle it.

95
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,901
- No. No. And my dad
is way too strict.

96
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,036
-<i> Try me.</i>

97
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:22,273
So, what'll it be?

98
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,511
- Are you serious?

99
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:28,046
- Are you?

100
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:29,614
- Hell yeah.

101
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:30,849
- Pick one.

102
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:51,669
- Not that one.

103
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:52,737
<i> The one next to it.</i>

104
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:55,006
- A body's a body.

105
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:56,508
- Yeah, well, I pick that one.

106
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,634
What's that for?

107
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:25,170
-<i> To make sure he's dead.</i>

108
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:26,704
There used to be a time
it was hard to tell

109
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:28,473
a comatose person
from a dead one.

110
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:31,843
So coroners tied bells
to everybody in the morgue.

111
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:32,877
So if they heard a 'ting'

112
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,479
they knew somebody down there

113
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,314
wasn't quite ready to go.

114
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,549
- So, why do you have one?

115
00:13:37,551 --> 00:13:41,119
- Well, I'm -- I'm a bit
of a traditionalist.

116
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,791
- Why did you cover his face?

117
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:49,594
- There wasn't much
of a face left to cover.

118
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:52,897
Point blank gun shot blast
tend to do that.

119
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:54,165
- Who shot him?

120
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:57,068
- Angle of entry suggests
he did it to himself.

121
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,071
Until we found strychnine
in his system

122
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:02,473
<i> and judging by the progress</i>
<i> it made</i>
<i> through his bloodstream</i>

123
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:06,444
he was already dead by the time
somebody blew his face off.

124
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:08,379
- Why would anyone do that?

125
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:10,348
- You sound like
your boyfriend.

126
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,785
Leave the "why" to the cops
and the shrinks.

127
00:14:13,787 --> 00:14:16,688
We're just here
to find cause of death.

128
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,756
No more, no less.

129
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:30,869
- You don't wanna see that.

130
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,605
- It's alright.

131
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:56,728
- Look who's easy now.

132
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,396
You should have seen
the look on your face.

133
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,998
- I can't wait to see
the look on your face

134
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,099
when you're not
getting laid tonight.

135
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:02,967
- Whoa, whoa. Hold on.
Hold on. Hold on.

136
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:06,137
Not even if I ply you
with popcorn and sourpatch kids?

137
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:10,108
- You're lucky you're cute.

138
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,544
How do you get used to that?

139
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,715
- You do and you don't.

140
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:22,120
Sheriff?

141
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:26,858
- Where's your dad?
- What happened?

142
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,259
-<i> Bring her back here,</i>
<i> Sheldon.</i>

143
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,066
- Dad, if you need me to stay--

144
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:36,501
- oh, don't worry about it.

145
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:37,835
You two go have your fun.

146
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:52,150
- Did you see the look
on Burke's face?

147
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:55,753
I mean, he wouldn't be here this
late if it wasn't important.

148
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:56,821
- Here we go.

149
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:59,090
- Well, my dad --
- there it is.

150
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:00,124
- I can't ditch him.

151
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,993
- So you're ditching me again.

152
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:03,728
What's he gonna do
when you leave?

153
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:08,099
- You haven't told him yet?

154
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:10,435
- No. It's not that simple.

155
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:11,869
- Wow.

156
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:13,204
- Babe.

157
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:15,073
I'm gonna tell him, okay?

158
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:17,342
Hey, you think
i wanna be here?

159
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:19,077
Down there?

160
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:20,445
This isn't my life.

161
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:23,448
I don't wanna be Austin tilden,
the morgue worker.

162
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:28,353
Just, he needs my help
right now.

163
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,222
- Come on, it's been two years.

164
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:32,890
He can take care of himself.

165
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:37,829
- Come back in a few hours.

166
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:41,733
We'll catch the midnight show,
grab a drink at Thornton's..

167
00:16:41,735 --> 00:16:43,401
Two drinks.

168
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:46,637
11 o'clock, I'm all yours.
I promise.

169
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:49,374
And don't, you know,
don't smile

170
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:50,842
because a smile
means "yes" you know.

171
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:53,644
I know it's in there.

172
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:55,313
Now, you're gonna
blow your whole game.

173
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,586
- Maybe.

174
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:05,957
- You're hot!

175
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,575
-<i> Found her in the basement</i>
<i> of the Douglas' place.</i>

176
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:27,945
No ID, no fingerprints
in the system.

177
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:29,814
<i> No one has a clue</i>
<i> who she is.</i>

178
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:31,949
-<i> I don't suppose you know</i>
<i> how she wound up there?</i>

179
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:34,452
Stanley.

180
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:38,823
Damn thing gets meaner
by the day.

181
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:44,562
- Alvarez there was working
at Paul and Carol's place.

182
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:47,565
My best bet?
He killed our Jane Doe.

183
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,434
<i> Needed a place</i>
<i> to dump the body.</i>

184
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:51,302
<i> Didn't count the Douglas'</i>
<i> being home</i>

185
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:52,737
<i> or Paul having a .38.</i>

186
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,138
First thing tomorrow,
I'll bring him in

187
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,473
but for now,
she's the priority.

188
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:56,774
-<i> Oh, still, it would</i>
<i> have been nice</i>

189
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:58,242
<i> to take a look</i>
<i> at the crime scene</i>

190
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:06,317
- I got four people dead

191
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:08,786
and no god damn clue
how any of it connects.

192
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:11,956
- Nobody's pissin'
in your grits here, shel.

193
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,424
But we do have protocol.

194
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,895
- Press is gonna need answers
on this in the morning

195
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:19,130
and I got nothing.

196
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:25,470
Now they'll buy a 10-79.

197
00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:28,139
I can give them
a b and e gone haywire.

198
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:30,808
But what I can't sell is her.

199
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:36,114
- Time frame?

200
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:37,882
- It's gotta be tonight.

201
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:38,983
- Okay.

202
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:43,688
You didn't have to come back.

203
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:46,057
- I know.

204
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:08,746
- This is the autopsy
of an unidentified female

205
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:11,149
henceforth known as "Jane Doe."

206
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:13,117
Performing the autopsy
will be myself

207
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,852
Tommy tilden,
attending coroner.

208
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:17,588
I will be assisted
by Austin tilden

209
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,391
certified medical technician.

210
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:23,728
This autopsy will be
conducted in four stages

211
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,497
beginning with
an external evaluation

212
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,399
followed by
an internal evaluation

213
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:30,735
of the heart and lungs,
the digestive organs

214
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:32,904
and finally, the brain.

215
00:19:32,906 --> 00:19:34,305
-<i> We've got some beautiful</i>
<i> weather here</i>

216
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:35,706
<i> for the next few days.</i>

217
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:40,011
- Subject is
in her mid to late 20s.

218
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:41,913
- Appears to be.

219
00:19:41,915 --> 00:19:46,150
- Subject appears to be
in her mid to late 20s.

220
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:49,120
Caucasian.
Skin appears normal.

221
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:53,391
No outwards signs
of bleeding or bruising.

222
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:56,561
No scarring, no distinctive
external markings.

223
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:01,699
Hair, brown.

224
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:03,434
Eyes..

225
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:06,971
...grey?

226
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:11,943
-<i> Huh.</i>

227
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:15,646
You don't see
clouding like that

228
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:17,481
<i> unless a body's been dead</i>
<i> for days.</i>

229
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:23,821
There's no lividity.

230
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:25,590
-<i> No rigor mortis either.</i>

231
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:27,291
When do you think she died?

232
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:29,594
- Well, she's colder
than the ambient temperature.

233
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:31,262
-<i> What, conditions</i>
<i> at the scene?</i>

234
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:33,431
- Could be confounding factors.

235
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:35,633
- Look how small her waist is.

236
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:37,602
Like it doesn't really fit
the rest of her frame.

237
00:20:37,604 --> 00:20:38,803
- Could be congenital.

238
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:40,471
We won't know
until we open her up.

239
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:42,740
Mark it down on the board.
We'll come back to it later.

240
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:12,937
Her wrists and ankles
are fractured.

241
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:17,008
-<i> How do you break</i>
<i> your wrists and ankles</i>

242
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:18,976
without any outward signs?

243
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:21,145
- Oh, I see it all the time.

244
00:21:21,147 --> 00:21:22,346
Simple fractures.

245
00:21:22,348 --> 00:21:24,982
- Simple? Uh-uh.
Her joints are shattered.

246
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:31,689
<i> What is that?</i>
<i> What is it? Dirt?</i>

247
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:34,258
-<i> No, no, this is denser.</i>

248
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,861
Heavier.

249
00:21:36,863 --> 00:21:39,363
It's -- this is peat.

250
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:42,300
Haven't seen this stuff
in ages.

251
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:44,135
-<i> It's under her toenails,</i>
<i> too.</i>

252
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:47,638
- Yeah. There are trace
amounts in the hair.

253
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:51,309
<i> She's covered in it.</i>

254
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:52,710
- Like, maybe she was
buried in it?

255
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:55,980
Where do you even find peat?

256
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:58,683
- You buy it at a nursery.

257
00:21:58,685 --> 00:22:01,218
But naturally in the ground..

258
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:03,754
...up north.

259
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:05,323
Not around here.

260
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:13,731
Nasal passages,
no sign of inflammation.

261
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:16,834
No fluid
and no foreign substances

262
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:19,170
and ear canals are..

263
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:22,973
...clear.

264
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,581
Oh.

265
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,483
I hadn't expected that.

266
00:22:32,485 --> 00:22:33,584
- Tongue has been --

267
00:22:33,586 --> 00:22:35,353
-<i> severed.</i>

268
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:37,555
Crudely. Non surgically.

269
00:22:37,557 --> 00:22:38,823
- Well, she could have bitten
it off, you know

270
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:40,558
she ods on something,
tensed up --

271
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,526
- these aren't bite marks.

272
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:46,130
See, striations.
Huh?

273
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,872
I've seen something
like this before

274
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,675
about 15 years back.

275
00:22:57,677 --> 00:23:00,611
Human trafficking
around Norfolk.

276
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,347
Two girls

277
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:06,117
hands and feet

278
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:08,819
bound tight

279
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:10,821
<i> to keep them from running.</i>

280
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:12,990
Cut out their tongues

281
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:14,358
for making too much noise --

282
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,828
- you think this was some kind
of a prostitution thing?

283
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,597
- Can't rule it out.

284
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:08,012
Here, she has a molar missing
on the lower left side.

285
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:10,514
Take some impressions.

286
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:36,240
- It's definitely
some kind of fabric.

287
00:24:36,242 --> 00:24:39,276
- Bag it.
Send it to the lab.

288
00:25:01,234 --> 00:25:04,768
No external seminal fluid
present.

289
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,337
Give me a swab.

290
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:39,537
<i> Ah, she's torn up inside.</i>

291
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:43,340
<i> There are ridges,</i>
<i> grooves in the tissue.</i>

292
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:45,109
-<i> Abrasions?</i>

293
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:47,411
-<i> No. Cuts.</i>

294
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:50,180
Deliberate.

295
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:58,522
-<i> Severed tongue,</i>
<i> shattered joints</i>

296
00:25:58,524 --> 00:26:00,891
vaginal trauma..

297
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:03,093
The theory tracks.

298
00:26:03,095 --> 00:26:05,062
- We're barely out
of the external.

299
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:07,698
<i> We got a ways to go.</i>

300
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:21,211
We'll now proceed
with the internal examination

301
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:23,647
starting with the heart
and lungs.

302
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:26,183
Help me with the block.

303
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:42,026
- They're not supposed
to bleed like that. Right?

304
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:47,498
- I've seen it.

305
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,067
But only on a fresh corpse.

306
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:51,735
<i> An hour dead, maybe two.</i>

307
00:27:51,737 --> 00:27:54,705
It's caused by a build up
of pressure.

308
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,022
- What is that?

309
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:14,024
<i> Melanoma maybe?</i>

310
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:17,628
- On the inside?

311
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,329
<i> Possible.</i>

312
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:21,598
Let's see what the lab
comes back with.

313
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:33,744
<i> Can you hand me</i>
<i> the rib cutters?</i>

314
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:44,288
Today?

315
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:01,371
-<i> Shit.</i>

316
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:07,044
- What did you do?

317
00:29:07,046 --> 00:29:09,012
- Oh, I got it.

318
00:29:09,014 --> 00:29:10,748
- I need you to focus here.

319
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,617
- I got it.

320
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:19,790
- Well, you were right.

321
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:23,494
Her waist
doesn't fit her frame.

322
00:29:23,496 --> 00:29:24,728
<i> It's not congenital.</i>

323
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:25,996
- Then what is it?

324
00:29:25,998 --> 00:29:30,400
Well, if you wear one
long enough, a corset --

325
00:29:30,402 --> 00:29:33,604
- didn't those go out of style
a couple of hundred years ago?

326
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:57,928
- The lungs

327
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:00,664
severely blackened.

328
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:03,600
- Wouldn't have taken her
for a smoker.

329
00:30:03,602 --> 00:30:05,169
- She could smoke

330
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:08,405
ten packs a day for 30 years

331
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:09,840
wouldn't explain this.

332
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,710
- But that's what killed her,
right?

333
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:16,713
- No, this amount
of lung damage though

334
00:30:16,715 --> 00:30:21,618
I'd expect the body to be
covered in third degree burns.

335
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:24,588
It's like finding a --
a bullet in the brain

336
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,925
but with no gunshot wound.

337
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:39,069
Her heart's marked up.

338
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:41,138
Almost like it's been cut.

339
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:47,077
- Well, not just her heart.

340
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:50,180
<i> What do you think that is?</i>
<i> Genetic defect?</i>

341
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:51,849
-<i> Probably scar tissue.</i>

342
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:54,384
- Scar tissue?

343
00:30:54,386 --> 00:30:55,786
From what?

344
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,524
- Imagine all this
internal trauma

345
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:03,427
was reflected externally.

346
00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:05,629
Shattered ankles and wrists

347
00:31:05,631 --> 00:31:09,066
<i> fire-burned lungs,</i>
<i> scarred organs.</i>

348
00:31:09,068 --> 00:31:10,634
What would she look like?

349
00:31:10,636 --> 00:31:13,270
- She'd be mangled.

350
00:31:13,272 --> 00:31:16,073
Disfigured beyond recognition

351
00:31:16,075 --> 00:31:18,008
but she's not.

352
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:22,279
I mean, how the hell
do you even do this?

353
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,388
- If you wanna kill someone
you shoot them

354
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,224
or poison them or drown them.

355
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:35,959
A million easy ways.

356
00:31:35,961 --> 00:31:38,228
You don't go to these lengths

357
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:41,832
unless you wanna make them
suffer

358
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:50,307
what the --

359
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:51,742
- I'll get it.

360
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:25,776
- So clean.

361
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,320
<i> What happened to you?</i>

362
00:34:55,394 --> 00:34:57,327
What the hell happened?

363
00:34:57,329 --> 00:34:58,762
<i> Are you okay?</i>

364
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:00,664
- Something's in the vent.

365
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,003
Thanks.

366
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:14,778
Oh, shit.

367
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:49,606
- Give me a minute.

368
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:40,257
<i> What are you doing?</i>

369
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:44,394
- The drawer..

370
00:37:44,396 --> 00:37:46,496
Must have not closed it
all the way.

371
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:58,174
- Stanley was a pain
in the ass.

372
00:37:58,176 --> 00:38:00,277
<i> But he was your mother's.</i>

373
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:02,679
<i> One of the few things</i>
<i> of hers I had left.</i>

374
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:06,082
- Yeah, I miss her, too.

375
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:08,385
- Right.
Let's keep going.

376
00:38:11,757 --> 00:38:15,358
<i> This is stage three</i>
<i> of the autopsy of Jane Doe.</i>

377
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,694
Beginning with the stomach

378
00:38:17,696 --> 00:38:20,030
and the gastro-intestinal
system.

379
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:28,872
- Dad, you can talk to me.

380
00:38:28,874 --> 00:38:31,675
- I'm not keeping
anything from you.

381
00:38:31,677 --> 00:38:35,278
- You just -- you put up
this act for people --

382
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:38,248
- I'm fine.

383
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:42,986
- Alright.

384
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:56,566
<i> What is that?</i>

385
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,203
A flower?

386
00:39:18,256 --> 00:39:21,624
- Jimson weed.
Paralyzing agent.

387
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:24,427
Probably explains
the inflammation on her organs.

388
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,365
Hmm.
Here's a weird thing.

389
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:39,642
That settles it.
She's from up north.

390
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:43,146
- Yeah, but how did she
end up here?

391
00:39:43,148 --> 00:39:44,914
- One thing at a time.

392
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:47,050
I'm just trying to make sense
of all this.

393
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:54,924
-<i> Gusts are now being reported</i>
<i> at up to 60 miles per hour.</i>

394
00:39:54,926 --> 00:39:57,994
<i> Rain is expected to top</i>
<i> three inches within the hour.</i>

395
00:39:57,996 --> 00:40:01,398
<i> This one might be</i>
<i> a bigger deal</i>
<i> than we were led to believe.</i>

396
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:05,769
- Dad, how about we just
finish this in the morning?

397
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:10,039
- Burke needs a COD tonight.

398
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:12,942
We're not even close.

399
00:40:12,944 --> 00:40:15,812
When we start something,
we finish it.

400
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:19,682
<i> You wanna leave..</i>

401
00:40:19,684 --> 00:40:20,917
...leave.

402
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:15,705
-<i> It looks like</i>
<i> some kind of shroud.</i>

403
00:41:15,707 --> 00:41:18,942
- Hmm. And old.

404
00:41:18,944 --> 00:41:20,877
- Stomach acids should have
dissolved this thing.

405
00:41:20,879 --> 00:41:25,014
I mean, the fact that
it's intact at all is amazing.

406
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:30,286
Now see, what is that?

407
00:41:30,288 --> 00:41:31,821
<i> Roman numerals?</i>

408
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:52,809
Okay.

409
00:41:52,811 --> 00:41:55,678
- These numerals.

410
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,349
The order.
T and -- and this s.

411
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:00,617
<i> It doesn't fit.</i>

412
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:05,688
What are you doing?

413
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:27,210
- Someone pulled out her tooth

414
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:28,511
wrapped it in fabric
and forced her

415
00:42:28,513 --> 00:42:29,679
to swallow it.

416
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:32,382
- And the drawing?

417
00:42:32,384 --> 00:42:33,383
- I don't know. Religious?

418
00:42:33,385 --> 00:42:35,852
Possibly, uh, ritualistic?

419
00:42:35,854 --> 00:42:38,788
- Well, let's play
that one out.

420
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:40,990
Every ritual has its purpose.

421
00:42:40,992 --> 00:42:43,693
What mo have we seen so far?

422
00:42:43,695 --> 00:42:45,962
- First they bound her.

423
00:42:45,964 --> 00:42:49,399
<i> Then they ripped out</i>
<i> her tongue, poisoned her</i>

424
00:42:49,401 --> 00:42:52,735
<i> paralyzed her forced her</i>
<i> to swallow the cloth.</i>

425
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:59,175
<i> Then, uh, the cuts, the</i>
<i> internal mutilation, stabs.</i>

426
00:42:59,177 --> 00:43:02,812
Then as if that wasn't enough,
they burned her.

427
00:43:07,686 --> 00:43:09,819
Almost like a human sacrifice

428
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:13,523
-<i> I got to tell you we have</i>
<i> serious weather reports</i>

429
00:43:13,525 --> 00:43:16,326
<i> coming in from all</i>
<i> the monitoring stations</i>
<i> across the state.</i>

430
00:43:16,328 --> 00:43:18,628
<i> We've got</i>
<i> a flash flood warning</i>
<i> now in full effect</i>

431
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:20,296
<i> for all of grantham county.</i>

432
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,001
<i> They've got concerns about..</i>

433
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:27,637
- You can't kill
someone this way

434
00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:30,173
without leaving a trace
on the outside.

435
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:33,209
She doesn't even have
a broken nail.

436
00:43:33,211 --> 00:43:35,845
- If we could just find out
why she was tortured --

437
00:43:35,847 --> 00:43:38,114
- down here,
if you can't see it

438
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:41,050
touch it, it doesn't matter.

439
00:43:41,052 --> 00:43:45,121
- Now, these bodies
are not just cods, dad.

440
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:47,256
This happened to her
for a reason.

441
00:43:47,258 --> 00:43:48,825
-<i> Trust me when I tell you</i>

442
00:43:48,827 --> 00:43:51,661
<i> this is not a storm you</i>
<i> wanna get caught in, folks.</i>

443
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:54,797
<i> If you're home, stay home.</i>

444
00:43:56,734 --> 00:43:58,368
<i> One thing's for sure.</i>

445
00:43:58,370 --> 00:43:59,836
<i> You're not going anywhere.</i>

446
00:44:14,853 --> 00:44:16,019
- Hey, dad?

447
00:44:19,691 --> 00:44:22,558
I think maybe
we should get out of here.

448
00:44:40,512 --> 00:44:42,945
Help me with this.

449
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:05,768
- Holy shit.

450
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,239
-<i> What the fuck?</i>

451
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:49,946
Dad? Dad?

452
00:45:49,948 --> 00:45:51,247
-<i> Here!</i>

453
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:08,631
Let's get the fuck out of here.

454
00:46:19,843 --> 00:46:22,178
- Come on, come on.

455
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:32,455
- The generator.

456
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:40,596
- There's not enough power.

457
00:46:54,044 --> 00:46:56,078
- It's stuck.

458
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:59,482
<i> Help me with this.</i>
<i> Help me with this!</i>

459
00:47:04,421 --> 00:47:05,855
<i> The old sycamore fell.</i>

460
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:14,897
- Fuck!

461
00:47:14,899 --> 00:47:17,233
- The office. The landline.

462
00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:52,735
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know.

463
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:56,672
Oh, thank god.

464
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:01,310
-<i> Harding county</i>
<i> Sheriff Department.</i>

465
00:48:01,312 --> 00:48:04,046
- This is Tommy tilden.
It's an emergency. We need help.

466
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:05,448
-<i> Sorry, I've trouble</i>
<i> hearing --</i>

467
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:06,949
-<i> put Burke on the line.</i>

468
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:11,954
-<i> This is Burke.</i>

469
00:48:11,956 --> 00:48:15,358
- Sheldon, this is Tommy.
You better get over here now.

470
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,227
-<i> Hello? Tommy, I can</i>
<i> scarcely hear you.</i>
<i> Your voice is breaking up.</i>

471
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:21,497
- Sheldon! Sheldon, we're
trapped down here, godda..

472
00:48:21,499 --> 00:48:23,165
Sheldon, please --
-<i> Tommy.</i>

473
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:04,100
- What the fuck is going on?

474
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:07,803
<i> It's her.</i>

475
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:12,341
Everything was fine until Burke
wheeled her through that door.

476
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:15,411
- Son --
- until we cut into her.

477
00:50:15,413 --> 00:50:17,913
- You're talking
about a corpse.

478
00:50:30,727 --> 00:50:33,429
- These things we found
inside her

479
00:50:33,431 --> 00:50:36,732
her injuries, those marks.

480
00:50:36,734 --> 00:50:38,634
You can't say she's just a body.

481
00:50:57,454 --> 00:51:00,656
We should have left.

482
00:51:00,658 --> 00:51:02,058
I wanted to leave.

483
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:12,535
Dad!

484
00:51:18,942 --> 00:51:20,609
Oh.

485
00:51:20,611 --> 00:51:22,411
- No!

486
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:24,547
Dad! Dad!

487
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:36,092
Dad?

488
00:51:36,094 --> 00:51:38,394
- Oh, shit. Oh..

489
00:51:50,575 --> 00:51:51,907
- Oh, my god.

490
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:54,043
Oh, my god.

491
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:56,879
- Careful, careful.

492
00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:01,250
Oh, god! Ohh.

493
00:52:01,252 --> 00:52:02,918
Help me up.
- Yeah.

494
00:52:06,723 --> 00:52:08,057
- I'm fine.

495
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:11,760
They were grey.

496
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:15,631
Her eyes.

497
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,634
It had her eyes.

498
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,905
- That's what I've been trying
to tell you.

499
00:52:22,907 --> 00:52:24,073
It's her.

500
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:27,009
- Oh, no, that's not possible.

501
00:52:27,011 --> 00:52:28,844
- No, her body

502
00:52:28,846 --> 00:52:32,014
those things we found inside,
those were impossible.

503
00:52:34,217 --> 00:52:37,786
Whatever the hell
happened in here..

504
00:52:37,788 --> 00:52:40,456
...we are way past possible.

505
00:52:42,058 --> 00:52:43,392
It's her.

506
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:50,232
- So, what do we do?

507
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:05,708
<i> Rapid decomp.</i>

508
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:08,043
- Everything we took
out of her.

509
00:54:10,547 --> 00:54:13,649
That's almost like her body
was preserving it.

510
00:54:13,651 --> 00:54:15,651
- Must get her
to the crematorium.

511
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:27,856
- Fuck it.

512
00:55:58,988 --> 00:56:00,155
- Jesus!

513
00:56:04,394 --> 00:56:06,128
Behind you, the extinguisher.

514
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:10,132
The pin. Pull the pin.

515
00:56:37,293 --> 00:56:38,560
No.

516
00:56:48,938 --> 00:56:50,272
<i> The elevator.</i>

517
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:22,938
- Come on.

518
00:57:27,577 --> 00:57:29,244
No, no, no, no! Fuck!

519
00:58:06,382 --> 00:58:09,718
<i> Come on. Come on. Come on.</i>

520
00:58:11,455 --> 00:58:12,788
Come on!

521
00:58:42,218 --> 00:58:43,719
Go, dad. Come on.

522
00:58:49,325 --> 00:58:50,325
Come on.

523
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,601
Emma.

524
00:59:32,603 --> 00:59:34,069
Oh, no!

525
00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:36,138
Oh, no, no!

526
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:38,140
Oh, my god!

527
00:59:39,442 --> 00:59:41,944
Oh, no! No!

528
00:59:44,347 --> 00:59:45,514
No!

529
00:59:46,282 --> 00:59:48,216
- Oh, my god.

530
00:59:48,218 --> 00:59:50,218
- No!

531
00:59:58,695 --> 01:00:03,031
Oh, no, no, no!
- Austin..

532
01:00:17,313 --> 01:00:18,880
Austin, the elevator.

533
01:00:18,882 --> 01:00:20,882
Come on, now. Come on.

534
01:00:25,321 --> 01:00:26,822
Come on, son.

535
01:00:48,212 --> 01:00:49,544
Fuck!

536
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:54,116
<i> Fuck!</i>

537
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:11,933
- I told her
to come back for me.

538
01:01:13,236 --> 01:01:15,237
I told her to come back.

539
01:01:16,539 --> 01:01:18,373
- No, you didn't do this.

540
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:23,612
You shouldn't be here.

541
01:01:23,614 --> 01:01:27,516
All this is my fault.

542
01:01:27,518 --> 01:01:30,619
- You couldn't have known.
- Yeah.

543
01:01:30,621 --> 01:01:33,522
Yeah, that's what
everyone told me..

544
01:01:33,524 --> 01:01:35,023
...about your mom.

545
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:43,031
You know why
i used to call her ray?

546
01:01:45,802 --> 01:01:47,469
Ray of sunshine.

547
01:01:49,906 --> 01:01:51,606
<i> She thought it was corny</i>
<i> as shit.</i>

548
01:01:52,843 --> 01:01:54,342
But it stuck.

549
01:01:58,147 --> 01:01:59,548
<i> If I'd have known,</i>
<i> I would have helped her.</i>

550
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:01,183
<i> You know that, don't you?</i>

551
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:05,353
I mean, she was always
so bright.

552
01:02:06,355 --> 01:02:07,689
<i> So happy.</i>

553
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:11,893
To think she was carrying around
all that

554
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:15,597
pain, all that unhappiness
every day.

555
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:17,466
I should've seen it.

556
01:02:17,468 --> 01:02:18,967
But I didn't.

557
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:23,672
<i>She had to deal with it alone.</i>

558
01:02:26,843 --> 01:02:28,744
All these mistakes..

559
01:02:30,113 --> 01:02:32,114
...my mistakes..

560
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:37,753
...and you had to pay for them.

561
01:03:10,653 --> 01:03:12,788
- Why hasn't she killed us yet?

562
01:03:12,790 --> 01:03:15,857
- Well, it's not for
want of trying.

563
01:03:15,859 --> 01:03:17,859
-<i> Well, look what she can do..</i>

564
01:03:19,662 --> 01:03:21,496
...if she wanted us dead.

565
01:03:26,569 --> 01:03:29,337
When we cut into her..

566
01:03:29,339 --> 01:03:32,140
<i> ...she tried to stop us</i>
<i> each time.</i>

567
01:03:32,142 --> 01:03:35,811
It's like there's something
she doesn't want us to find.

568
01:03:50,226 --> 01:03:51,860
- You wanna go back in there?

569
01:03:51,862 --> 01:03:56,198
- If we stay here, we're dead.

570
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:58,667
If we could just figure out
how she died..

571
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:05,173
...maybe we can figure out
how to stop her.

572
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:18,513
Dad?
- Right behind you.

573
01:05:20,149 --> 01:05:21,983
<i> Keep moving.</i>

574
01:05:28,491 --> 01:05:29,991
Austin?

575
01:05:33,297 --> 01:05:35,297
Ah!
- Dad?

576
01:05:36,999 --> 01:05:38,166
-<i> No!</i>

577
01:05:41,837 --> 01:05:43,171
- Dad?

578
01:05:59,989 --> 01:06:02,557
Dad. Dad.

579
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:04,059
Come on. Come on.

580
01:06:26,282 --> 01:06:27,949
<i> Come on.</i>

581
01:06:36,425 --> 01:06:37,926
Okay.

582
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:08,156
<i> Brain...Is normal.</i>

583
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:11,026
- There's got to be something.

584
01:07:12,395 --> 01:07:14,729
<i> All her other organs</i>
<i> are scarred.</i>

585
01:07:36,652 --> 01:07:38,453
- What the fuck?

586
01:07:38,455 --> 01:07:39,788
- What is it?

587
01:07:58,874 --> 01:08:01,876
- That's why we couldn't find
cause of death.

588
01:08:06,148 --> 01:08:07,816
- She's still alive.

589
01:08:09,351 --> 01:08:10,518
- Alive?

590
01:08:11,554 --> 01:08:14,656
We lit her on fire.

591
01:08:14,658 --> 01:08:16,491
We took out her heart.

592
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:22,097
- There's something,
some energy.

593
01:08:22,099 --> 01:08:25,300
<i> Call it what you want,</i>
<i> something is keeping</i>
<i> her going.</i>

594
01:08:44,353 --> 01:08:46,121
-<i> What the..</i>

595
01:08:53,028 --> 01:08:54,829
<i> Leviticus.</i>

596
01:08:59,034 --> 01:09:00,802
- Let me see that.

597
01:09:04,473 --> 01:09:06,007
<i> Leviticus.</i>

598
01:09:07,409 --> 01:09:09,844
Twenty. Twenty seven.

599
01:09:18,354 --> 01:09:19,988
- If these are Roman numerals

600
01:09:19,990 --> 01:09:21,156
then they'd be..

601
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:30,665
...1693.

602
01:09:31,567 --> 01:09:33,434
-<i> "Any man or woman</i>

603
01:09:33,436 --> 01:09:35,470
<i> "who consults</i>
<i> the spirits of the dead</i>

604
01:09:35,472 --> 01:09:37,705
"shall be put to death

605
01:09:37,707 --> 01:09:39,607
for they are.."

606
01:09:43,612 --> 01:09:46,514
- Dad.

607
01:09:46,516 --> 01:09:48,483
Seventeenth century.

608
01:09:48,485 --> 01:09:50,285
North east.

609
01:09:53,222 --> 01:09:54,722
New england.

610
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:06,768
<i> "They are a witch</i>

611
01:10:06,770 --> 01:10:10,071
and their blood shall be on
their own heads."

612
01:10:18,914 --> 01:10:21,516
It fits.

613
01:10:21,518 --> 01:10:23,184
- Witches are a myth.

614
01:10:25,354 --> 01:10:28,189
- You can't keep denying.

615
01:10:28,191 --> 01:10:30,225
- There were no witches
in Salem.

616
01:10:31,026 --> 01:10:33,995
They were kids. Young girls.

617
01:10:33,997 --> 01:10:36,598
Falsely accused,
wrapped up in hysteria

618
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:38,766
one pointing to the next,
who pointed to the next

619
01:10:38,768 --> 01:10:41,369
<i> but they were all,</i>
<i> all innocent.</i>

620
01:10:43,839 --> 01:10:47,675
Only...They didn't hang her..

621
01:10:47,677 --> 01:10:49,510
...or burn her at the stake.

622
01:10:50,346 --> 01:10:52,247
<i> They tortured her..</i>

623
01:10:54,016 --> 01:10:55,283
<i> ...mercilessly.</i>

624
01:10:55,285 --> 01:10:58,653
- The ritual.

625
01:10:58,655 --> 01:11:00,054
It didn't work.

626
01:11:14,069 --> 01:11:15,770
- What if..

627
01:11:16,905 --> 01:11:18,306
What if

628
01:11:18,308 --> 01:11:21,276
<i> the ritual,</i>
<i> performed on an innocent</i>

629
01:11:21,278 --> 01:11:26,447
accidentally created the very
thing we're trying to destroy?

630
01:11:28,884 --> 01:11:30,885
Everything they did to her.

631
01:11:30,887 --> 01:11:33,221
<i> Everything we've done to her.</i>

632
01:11:34,023 --> 01:11:35,857
She can feel it.

633
01:11:39,695 --> 01:11:45,533
She wants us...To feel it too.

634
01:11:53,042 --> 01:11:55,343
That's why
she's keeping us alive.

635
01:11:59,915 --> 01:12:01,983
This is her revenge.

636
01:12:04,453 --> 01:12:07,655
This is her ritual.

637
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:13,928
-<i> But why us?</i>

638
01:12:13,930 --> 01:12:15,029
-<i> Why the Douglas'?</i>

639
01:12:15,031 --> 01:12:17,198
Why anybody?

640
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:18,633
We're on her path, that's all.

641
01:12:18,635 --> 01:12:20,802
We were just stops
along the way.

642
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:25,306
<i> Those who survived</i>
<i> got rid of her</i>

643
01:12:25,308 --> 01:12:27,308
and buried her
as far away as possible.

644
01:12:28,143 --> 01:12:30,078
- That hasn't stopped her.

645
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:33,681
- Because no one
got close enough.

646
01:12:34,983 --> 01:12:39,454
No one could see
what we have seen.

647
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:48,529
She's still suffering..

648
01:12:50,766 --> 01:12:52,967
<i> ...and it won't stop.</i>

649
01:12:53,936 --> 01:12:55,903
It won't stop until..

650
01:12:56,472 --> 01:12:58,439
- Until what?

651
01:13:01,677 --> 01:13:04,278
Dad, until what?

652
01:13:17,126 --> 01:13:18,626
- I won't fight you.

653
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:21,129
<i> But please..</i>

654
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:24,899
...please don't hurt him.

655
01:13:25,768 --> 01:13:27,101
<i> Let me help you.</i>

656
01:13:27,636 --> 01:13:28,636
- Dad!

657
01:13:59,535 --> 01:14:00,635
Dad?

658
01:14:04,473 --> 01:14:05,640
No!

659
01:14:07,075 --> 01:14:08,075
Dad!

660
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:02,630
Dad.

661
01:15:13,442 --> 01:15:14,509
No.

662
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:22,717
- Please..

663
01:15:24,753 --> 01:15:26,087
Please..

664
01:15:27,322 --> 01:15:28,523
Please..

665
01:16:47,736 --> 01:16:49,637
-<i> Tommy!</i>

666
01:16:49,639 --> 01:16:51,973
-<i> Austin! Are you there?</i>

667
01:16:51,975 --> 01:16:53,140
- Burke?

668
01:16:58,246 --> 01:16:59,914
-<i> Anyone there?</i>

669
01:17:00,415 --> 01:17:01,749
- Burke.

670
01:17:03,151 --> 01:17:05,119
-<i> Austin!</i>

671
01:17:09,124 --> 01:17:11,292
<i> Austin! Are you down there?</i>

672
01:17:11,294 --> 01:17:14,695
<i> We're sawing down a tree</i>
<i> blocking your door.</i>

673
01:17:14,697 --> 01:17:16,897
<i> We'll be with you</i>
<i> right now, alright.</i>

674
01:17:24,339 --> 01:17:25,406
<i> Austin!</i>

675
01:17:25,408 --> 01:17:26,607
- I'm here!

676
01:17:26,609 --> 01:17:28,709
-<i> Almost there.</i>

677
01:17:28,711 --> 01:17:30,077
<i> You'll be alright.</i>

678
01:17:30,079 --> 01:17:32,146
<i> Just open up the door now.</i>

679
01:17:32,148 --> 01:17:34,248
- It's stuck.
-<i> Try again, son.</i>

680
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:35,916
- I can't. It won't.

681
01:17:37,085 --> 01:17:38,886
-<i> Should open up now.</i>

682
01:17:38,888 --> 01:17:40,254
- It won't.
-<i> Should open up.</i>

683
01:17:41,189 --> 01:17:42,757
- I'm trying. It's stuck.

684
01:17:42,759 --> 01:17:45,026
-<i> Open up.</i>

685
01:17:45,028 --> 01:17:47,328
- I can't.
-<i> Open up!</i>

686
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:48,963
- I can't.

687
01:19:14,950 --> 01:19:17,551
-<i> No obvious signs</i>
<i> of forced entry.</i>

688
01:19:17,553 --> 01:19:18,753
<i> Looks an awful lot like he --</i>

689
01:19:18,755 --> 01:19:20,855
- I've known his family
20 years.

690
01:19:22,324 --> 01:19:24,391
<i> Whatever it looks like,</i>
<i> that ain't it.</i>

691
01:19:27,262 --> 01:19:29,130
-<i> Well, it's going to be</i>
<i> another nice one out there.</i>

692
01:19:29,132 --> 01:19:31,499
<i> Today's our fourth</i>
<i> straight day of sunshine.</i>

693
01:19:31,501 --> 01:19:33,667
<i> Looking at a high of 75.</i>

694
01:19:33,669 --> 01:19:34,802
<i> Beautiful outdoor weather</i>

695
01:19:34,804 --> 01:19:36,937
<i> but remember to use</i>
<i> your sunscreen.</i>

696
01:19:41,476 --> 01:19:43,744
- What the hell happened here?

697
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:52,787
- What do you want to do
with her?

698
01:19:54,189 --> 01:19:56,323
- Get her out of here.
- Already got a car waiting.

699
01:19:56,325 --> 01:19:58,626
There's that, uh, funeral home
over in ruxton.

700
01:19:58,628 --> 01:20:01,028
- Get her out of my county.

701
01:20:01,030 --> 01:20:03,430
Take her over to vcu.

702
01:20:03,432 --> 01:20:05,099
Let ward lamon deal with her.

703
01:20:53,448 --> 01:20:55,950
- Now, baby, listen
that was one time.

704
01:20:57,586 --> 01:20:58,953
Hell, yes, that's a promise.

705
01:20:58,955 --> 01:21:00,654
-<i> And you know what hebrews</i>
<i> chapter four says</i>

706
01:21:00,656 --> 01:21:04,391
<i>"the word of god is powerful."</i>
