He's little. I've had to help him.

410

you allow him to be afraid.

<i>NARRATOR:
So, you could call all of this</i>

1286
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:47,874
<i>a big misunderstanding
if you wanted to.</i>

1287
01:25:47,976 --> 01:25:51,275
<i>A king was hurt, so he hurt a rat.</i>

1288

<i>And a rat was hurt,

1289
01:25:55,216 --> 01:25:58,344
<i>And a princess was hurt,</i>
<i>so she hurt a servant girl,</i>

<i>hurting for so long,</i>

<i>that almost nothing</i>
<i>could make her feel better.</i>

<i>But was it a mistake</i>
<i>or was it just good luck?</i>

1294
01:26:13,535 --> 01:26:16,163
<i>Because the servant girl</i>
<i>went back to her farm.</i>

<i>And the jailer finally
found his princess.</i>

<i>And the King found something</i>
<i>stronger than grief.</i>

<i>And the mice finally
got rid of their fear.</i>

1298

<i>And the people of Dor</i>
<i>lived side by side with their rats.</i>
