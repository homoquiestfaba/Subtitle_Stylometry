got any of them.

I look so fat, ugly, and stupid

183
00:11:53,103 --> 00:11:54,583
in all those pictures.

184
00:11:54,626 --> 00:11:55,845
Fat? Are you
kidding me?

185
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:57,717
You're like the poster
child for thin people.

186
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,868
My god, and look
at this one here.

187
00:11:58,892 --> 00:12:02,417
You're like,
"come fly on my airplane."

188
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,288
Exactly. Stupid.

189
00:12:04,332 --> 00:12:07,901
Stupid? You could get a very
good job as a stewardess

190
00:12:07,944 --> 00:12:09,598
in a movie with this one.

191
00:12:09,641 --> 00:12:10,468
Mm-hmm.

192
00:12:10,512 --> 00:12:12,557
Have I seen you in anything?

193
00:12:12,601 --> 00:12:14,777
Probably not.
Grape juice?

194
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:16,518
Are we allowed to have that?

195
00:12:16,561 --> 00:12:18,520
It's medicinal.

196
00:12:18,563 --> 00:12:21,436
So, why do you live out here?

197
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:23,307
What's wrong with staten island?

198
00:12:23,351 --> 00:12:24,439
I don't know.

199
00:12:24,482 --> 00:12:26,267
Isn't it just kind
of far from Broadway

200
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,592
and your auditions
and everything?

201
00:12:27,616 --> 00:12:29,792
Mmm, I spent 10 years
in the city,

202
00:12:29,836 --> 00:12:33,187
and, um, I needed some amnesia.

203
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,971
I'll drink to that.

204
00:12:35,015 --> 00:12:36,756
Problem is I'm 34 years old,

205
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,453
and I'm in danger
of being a waitress

206
00:12:38,496 --> 00:12:39,976
for the rest of my life.

207
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,631
Good night. All right,
girls, the party's over.

208
00:12:42,674 --> 00:12:44,764
Bye.

209
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:47,984
No, have mercy.

210
00:12:48,028 --> 00:12:49,769
You look good in this one.

211
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:51,248
I do?

212
00:12:51,292 --> 00:12:52,791
Yeah. The rest of them,
you look like a fucking dyke.

213
00:12:52,815 --> 00:12:53,642
Good-bye.

214
00:12:53,685 --> 00:12:55,513
Ugh! Good night!

215
00:12:55,557 --> 00:12:56,645
I'm getting drunk.

216
00:12:56,688 --> 00:12:58,647
Dyke?

217
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,252
Hi, grandma.

218
00:13:42,343 --> 00:13:44,867
Finished, darling?

219
00:13:44,911 --> 00:13:46,086
Good.

220
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:47,585
Mrs. Saladino?
By the way, I wanted to just

221
00:13:47,609 --> 00:13:49,872
thank you for the
job recommendation.

222
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:51,395
Are they treating you all right?

223
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:52,788
Yeah, fine.

224
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,094
If gio gives you any problem,

225
00:13:54,137 --> 00:13:55,791
you just let me know.

226
00:13:55,835 --> 00:14:00,317

drinking the hard stuff.

227
00:14:00,361 --> 00:14:02,537
Ok. Mrs. Saladino?

228
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,932
Do my parents ever
call or write?

229
00:14:05,975 --> 00:14:07,324
No, just the checks.

230
00:14:07,368 --> 00:14:10,327
I don't know what
they're doing down there,

231
00:14:10,371 --> 00:14:11,894
saving souls or something

232
00:14:11,938 --> 00:14:13,591
down there... what's that?

233
00:14:13,635 --> 00:14:14,766
South America.

234
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:17,160
Oh, yeah, that's it.

235
00:14:25,516 --> 00:14:27,518
It's ok.

237
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:33,742
Hey, come here, paesano.

238
00:14:41,315 --> 00:14:44,840
Gio: Meg? Meg!

239
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:47,016
Take these to 16.

240
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,758
16? But that's...
That's raychel's table.

241
00:14:49,801 --> 00:14:51,107
She's in the back.
Go.

242
00:14:51,151 --> 00:14:52,911
But she said that if ever
went near her customers,

243
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:56,591
she would kick my ass. Never mind. Go!

244
00:14:56,634 --> 00:14:58,375

His father says,
"great people, love you."

246

Just keep her away from the
fucking steak knives, all right?

Don't you worry.
We'll take care of everything.

Tell a joke, a monsoon
might fall into me.

266
00:15:45,074 --> 00:15:46,293
You're here a week,

267
00:15:46,336 --> 00:15:47,966

food on the regulars?

I'm sorry.
You lied to me.

You've never waited
tables, have you?

271
00:15:52,734 --> 00:15:53,885
No, I did. We didn't
have any liquor...

272
00:15:53,909 --> 00:15:55,519
No, you have not.
I can tell immediately.

273

Ok.

I know. It's tough.

place like this. I know.

be ok. Am I right?

You come back,
you ask me again what it is.

538
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,648
[Laughter]

539
00:26:46,692 --> 00:26:48,084
You know what I do whenever I go

540
00:26:48,128 --> 00:26:49,085
to a restaurant?

541
00:26:49,129 --> 00:26:51,653
The first thing I do, huh?

542
00:26:51,697 --> 00:26:52,785
I taste the butter.

543
00:26:52,828 --> 00:26:54,830
If the butter tastes
like the icebox,

544
00:26:54,874 --> 00:26:55,788
I know I got a problem.

545
00:26:55,831 --> 00:26:57,137
That's it. Come here.
Come here.

546
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,636
I'm gonna tell her my secret.
Here's my secret.

547
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,923
Stupid, it's the little things.

548
00:27:00,967 --> 00:27:01,968
Can you understand that?

549
00:27:02,011 --> 00:27:04,405
Please, don't ask me no more.

550
00:27:05,406 --> 00:27:08,539
I want you to understand
how much we appreciate

551
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:12,021
that little favor you did
for us last night, huh?

552
00:27:12,065 --> 00:27:13,588
Oh, well, the...

553
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:16,243
Anybody would have done
what I did. I mean...

554
00:27:16,286 --> 00:27:18,027
You did very, very well, ok?

555
00:27:18,071 --> 00:27:22,075
Down the road,
good things always come back to you.

556
00:27:22,118 --> 00:27:23,337
Thank you.

557
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,817
You're welcome.

558
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,427
I want you to meet
some of my friends.

559
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:27,210
This is Barbara...

560
00:27:27,254 --> 00:27:28,864
Hello. This is big Lou.

561
00:27:28,908 --> 00:27:29,735
Hi.

562
00:27:29,778 --> 00:27:30,823
And goombavinney.

563
00:27:30,866 --> 00:27:32,781
You had a good trip? It was beautiful.

564
00:27:32,825 --> 00:27:34,478
Everything good?

565
00:27:34,522 --> 00:27:36,002
Somebody must really like you

566
00:27:36,045 --> 00:27:38,004
to put you at this table.

567
00:27:38,047 --> 00:27:40,702
Oh... what can I say?

568
00:27:40,746 --> 00:27:42,704
You can say what your name is.

569
00:27:42,748 --> 00:27:43,618
Meg.

570
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,577
Meg... carmine,
Luigi.

571
00:27:46,621 --> 00:27:47,448
Hello.

572
00:27:47,491 --> 00:27:50,886
Umberto.
And I'm Gianni.

573
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:52,192
You're a nice new addition.

574
00:27:52,235 --> 00:27:53,584
I hope you stick around.

575
00:27:53,628 --> 00:27:55,674
Oh, thank you.

576
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:57,153
How's it goin'? Good.

577
00:27:57,197 --> 00:27:58,764
Enjoyin' it?
You havin' fun?

578
00:27:58,807 --> 00:27:59,721
Yeah.

579
00:27:59,765 --> 00:28:01,114
It's a nice place, huh?

580
00:28:01,157 --> 00:28:02,657
Should I get you
another bottle of wine?

581
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,552
Yeah, please.
Keep it comin'.

582
00:28:04,595 --> 00:28:05,292
Ok.

583
00:28:05,335 --> 00:28:07,294
Grazie.

584
00:28:07,337 --> 00:28:09,600

to be an actress

591
00:28:24,093 --> 00:28:25,181
in the first place?

592
00:28:25,225 --> 00:28:27,662
Um, I guess it was
my grandmother.

593
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:30,447
She was, um... she was a flapper,

594
00:28:30,491 --> 00:28:31,511
you know, in the twenties.

595
00:28:31,535 --> 00:28:33,755
And she used to
put on those dresses

596
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:36,192
and do the dances,
like the Charleston

597
00:28:36,236 --> 00:28:37,474
and the Lindy hop
and the shimmy,

598
00:28:37,498 --> 00:28:40,153
and then she would
take me to nursing homes

599
00:28:40,196 --> 00:28:41,763
and the kiwanis clubs,

600
00:28:41,807 --> 00:28:43,417
and we would perform.

601
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,897
You would do the dances?

602
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,767
Yes.

603
00:28:45,811 --> 00:28:46,681
Can you still do them?

604
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:47,832
Yeah, I guess so. Oh, show me!

605
00:28:47,856 --> 00:28:49,118
No. Oh, come on. I want to see.

606
00:28:49,162 --> 00:28:50,598
It's so embarrassing. Oh, come on.

607
00:28:50,641 --> 00:28:52,339
All right, I'm gonna
do it just once.

608
00:28:52,382 --> 00:28:53,253
Ok.

609
00:28:53,296 --> 00:28:54,167
All right.

610
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:55,690
So, the Charleston...

611
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:56,909
The Lindy hop...

612
00:28:56,952 --> 00:28:59,563
Oh, my god. And the shimmy.

613
00:28:59,607 --> 00:29:01,914
And I loved it.

614
00:29:01,957 --> 00:29:04,568
Ok, that's silly.
So what about you?

615
00:29:04,612 --> 00:29:05,613
What about me?

616
00:29:05,656 --> 00:29:08,747
Why did you want
to become a doctor?

617
00:29:10,618 --> 00:29:13,099
There was this albino squirrel.

618
00:29:13,142 --> 00:29:14,361
An albino squirrel?

619
00:29:14,404 --> 00:29:16,667
Ok, when I was little,
we lived in this house,

620
00:29:16,711 --> 00:29:18,254
and there was, like,
a woods right across the street,

621
00:29:18,278 --> 00:29:22,108
and one day, my brother and
I were walking in the woods,

622
00:29:22,151 --> 00:29:23,805
and we found this little nest...

623
00:29:23,849 --> 00:29:26,199
A little squirrel's nest that
had fallen out of the tree...

624
00:29:26,242 --> 00:29:28,114
And inside was this wriggling,

625
00:29:28,157 --> 00:29:30,769
tiny, little albino squirrel.

626
00:29:30,812 --> 00:29:31,857
Aww.
He was...

627
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,424
He was small enough
to fit in my hand.

628
00:29:34,468 --> 00:29:35,730
And he had little pink paws

629
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,601
and little pink eyes.

630
00:29:37,645 --> 00:29:39,690
So we fed it little
pieces of food,

631
00:29:39,734 --> 00:29:41,692
and we kept it in a
little cage at night,

632
00:29:41,736 --> 00:29:43,042
and we nursed it back to health.

633
00:29:43,085 --> 00:29:44,608
And it was running around,

634
00:29:44,652 --> 00:29:45,522
and it was totally tame.

635
00:29:45,566 --> 00:29:46,480
It would eat out of our hands

636
00:29:46,523 --> 00:29:47,803
and run up and sit
on my shoulder

637
00:29:47,829 --> 00:29:49,526
and sit in my brother's pocket.

638
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:50,397
That's so sweet.

639
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,833
Yeah. But then
somehow he ran

640
00:29:51,877 --> 00:29:53,356
underneath the cushions

641
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,967
on the seat of the couch,

642
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:58,318
and somebody sat on... killed it.

643
00:29:58,361 --> 00:29:59,710
In the couch. Yeah.

644
00:29:59,754 --> 00:30:02,496
Anyway, listen.
There's an upside.

645
00:30:02,539 --> 00:30:03,758
Ok.

646
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,388
4 weeks later,
we found another baby squirrel.

647
00:30:05,412 --> 00:30:06,824
It was not an albino squirrel.
It was just a brown squirrel,

648
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,676
but this one was nearly dead.

649
00:30:08,719 --> 00:30:09,590
He had all these wounds,

650
00:30:09,633 --> 00:30:10,896
and he had maggots and worms.

651
00:30:10,939 --> 00:30:11,984
Gross.

652
00:30:12,027 --> 00:30:13,483
So we went to the
local nature center,

653
00:30:13,507 --> 00:30:14,813
and they gave us this solution,

654
00:30:14,856 --> 00:30:16,989
and we poured it on the wounds

655
00:30:17,032 --> 00:30:19,774
and took q-tips and
took out the maggots...

656
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,994
And the squirrel survived.

657
00:30:22,037 --> 00:30:23,647
That's so nice.

658
00:30:23,691 --> 00:30:24,997
Yes.

659
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,870
Ok, here's to all the
squirrels in your family.

660
00:30:28,914 --> 00:30:31,090
Here's to your
flapper grandmother.

661
00:30:34,267 --> 00:30:37,748
Hello.
Hey, guys.

662
00:30:37,792 --> 00:30:40,316
How ya's doin'?

663
00:30:41,927 --> 00:30:43,842
Ci molta Bella.

664
00:30:43,885 --> 00:30:45,147
Hi, Frankie.

665
00:30:45,191 --> 00:30:48,847
You are very beautiful.

666
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:49,891
Thank you.

667
00:30:49,935 --> 00:30:52,720
Molta Bella, tesoro mio.

668
00:30:53,721 --> 00:30:56,550
[Speaking Italian]

669
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,865
[Speaking Italian]

670
00:31:13,784 --> 00:31:15,961
[Laughter]

671
00:31:16,787 --> 00:31:18,354
Sorry.

672
00:31:20,139 --> 00:31:21,618
She's all right.

673
00:31:21,662 --> 00:31:23,838
I do not believe you, sometimes.

674
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,187
Where did that come from?

675
00:31:25,231 --> 00:31:27,886
I took Italian in college.

676
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,846
I can't figure you out, babe.

677
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,501
Why not?

678
00:31:34,544 --> 00:31:36,111
'Cause you're, like, shy,

679
00:31:36,155 --> 00:31:37,504
but you're outgoing.

680
00:31:37,547 --> 00:31:40,376
You're insecure,
but you're conceited.

681
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,551
And then, like, some things,

682
00:31:41,595 --> 00:31:42,944
you're totally clueless,

683
00:31:42,988 --> 00:31:44,835
and then other things you
get in 2 fuckin' seconds.

684
00:31:44,859 --> 00:31:46,948
So, I'm confused.

685
00:31:46,992 --> 00:31:49,211
Is that supposed
to be a compliment?

686
00:31:49,255 --> 00:31:51,213
See? Now you're,
like, dissed,

687
00:31:51,257 --> 00:31:52,301
but you're also flattered.

688
00:31:52,345 --> 00:31:55,914
I'm not flattered.
I'm insulted.

689
00:31:55,957 --> 00:31:57,785
I'm not conceited.

690
00:31:57,828 --> 00:31:59,830
Whatever.

691
00:31:59,874 --> 00:32:00,875
But then...

692
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,834
Then there's
the med school thing...

693
00:32:03,878 --> 00:32:05,184
And here.

694
00:32:05,227 --> 00:32:08,883
And that's the thing that
makes no fuckin' sense.

695
00:32:09,666 --> 00:32:11,755
Ohh...

696
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:14,889
It doesn't make
any sense. I'm sorry.

697
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,457
You must've been
pretty good, right?

698
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,589
I was ok.

699
00:32:20,416 --> 00:32:22,027
So, what happened?

700
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:25,421
It was just something that I
thought that I was gonna be doing

701
00:32:25,465 --> 00:32:26,596
the rest of my life

702
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,120
and that I should be doing.

703
00:32:28,163 --> 00:32:30,600
And then one day...

704
00:32:30,644 --> 00:32:32,167
It didn't matter anymore.

705
00:32:32,211 --> 00:32:35,344
And nothing mattered anymore.

706
00:32:35,997 --> 00:32:38,826
Must've been a pretty
fucked up day, huh?

707
00:32:38,869 --> 00:32:41,872
Yeah, you could say that again.

708
00:32:42,917 --> 00:32:44,223
So, what happened?

709
00:32:44,266 --> 00:32:45,572
Is this 20 questions?

710
00:32:45,615 --> 00:32:48,096
No. I'm... ok,
I'm sorry. Sorry.

711
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,010
Just, like, you know,

712
00:32:49,054 --> 00:32:50,969
I like to know about the help.

713
00:32:51,012 --> 00:32:51,926
The help?!
Yeah.

714
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,884
What, are you running the place?

715
00:32:53,928 --> 00:32:55,016
No, but I will be.

716
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,976
It's just a matter of time.

717
00:32:58,019 --> 00:33:00,021
You ready?

718
00:33:00,065 --> 00:33:01,414
Hey.

obviously, right?

And then "7/11."
That's my birthday.

793
00:35:25,514 --> 00:35:26,776
The day I was born,

794
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,189
all the doctors and the
nurses in the hospital

795
00:35:28,213 --> 00:35:30,215
said I was gonna
be a very lucky baby.

796
00:35:30,258 --> 00:35:32,130
Yeah, but I was born July 11,

797
00:35:32,173 --> 00:35:34,088
and I have never been lucky.

798
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:34,958
What?!

799
00:35:35,002 --> 00:35:36,022
You were born on 7/11? Yes.

800
00:35:36,046 --> 00:35:37,439
Get the fuck outta here.
What year?

801
00:35:37,483 --> 00:35:38,832
A different one, obviously,

802
00:35:38,875 --> 00:35:40,138
because I've never been lucky.

803
00:35:40,181 --> 00:35:41,332
Wait a minute.
No, no, no, no, no.

804
00:35:41,356 --> 00:35:43,053
These are very, very,
very lucky numbers.

805
00:35:43,097 --> 00:35:45,012
It's like very...
Almost a spiritual thing.

806
00:35:45,055 --> 00:35:47,797
It's, like, every time, like,
I do, like, play roulette

807
00:35:47,841 --> 00:35:50,148
or freakin' bet on the
horses, whatever,

808
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:51,323
I always win.

809
00:35:51,366 --> 00:35:53,194
And then, like,
my last boyfriend, Marco,

810
00:35:53,238 --> 00:35:54,413
I met him on 7/11,

811
00:35:54,456 --> 00:35:56,197
and I broke up with him on 11/7.

812
00:35:56,241 --> 00:35:57,392
So, you know what
I'm talkin' about?

813
00:35:57,416 --> 00:35:59,200
Yeah, but were those both lucky?

814
00:35:59,244 --> 00:36:01,594
Yeah. Well, I mean,
it's hard to explain.

815
00:36:01,637 --> 00:36:03,037
It's like, ok,
when I first met him,

816
00:36:03,073 --> 00:36:05,206
he was really cute and
everything and all that,

817
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,792
but then, like the rest
of my boyfriends,

818
00:36:06,816 --> 00:36:08,011
he turned into a total asshole.

819
00:36:08,035 --> 00:36:09,315
So, I guess they were both good,

820
00:36:09,341 --> 00:36:11,865
but I can't believe
you were born

821
00:36:11,908 --> 00:36:12,822
on the same day as me.

822
00:36:12,866 --> 00:36:13,997
Meg: It's such
a coincidence.

823
00:36:14,041 --> 00:36:14,998
It's bizarre.

824
00:36:15,042 --> 00:36:16,237
Maybe you are gonna
make something

825
00:36:16,261 --> 00:36:17,218
out of yourself after all.
No, I doubt it.

826
00:36:17,262 --> 00:36:19,742
I told her she should
be in musicals.

827
00:36:19,786 --> 00:36:21,222
Musicals. You should
see her dance.

828
00:36:21,266 --> 00:36:24,094
See, look, you're
even dancing now.

829
00:36:24,138 --> 00:36:25,183
No, no, no, no, listen.

830
00:36:25,226 --> 00:36:26,488
7/11 is comin' up next week.

831
00:36:26,532 --> 00:36:27,900
We gotta do somethin',
like, really, really big.

832
00:36:27,924 --> 00:36:29,752
Like, really...
Like, just go sick.

833
00:36:29,796 --> 00:36:31,972
Like, I think you guys
just show up, right?

834
00:36:32,015 --> 00:36:33,060
And I'll just do it all.

835
00:36:33,103 --> 00:36:34,255
Like, you guys,
just don't dress down.

836
00:36:34,279 --> 00:36:35,430
Dress up.
You know what I mean?

837
00:36:35,454 --> 00:36:38,848
We're gonna freakin'
swing it on home.

838
00:36:38,892 --> 00:36:40,198
I wish I was born on 7/11.

839
00:36:40,241 --> 00:36:42,896
Well, you'll be with us anyway.
Whatever.

840
00:36:42,939 --> 00:36:44,158
I can't believe you were born

841
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,464
on the same day as me.

842
00:36:45,507 --> 00:36:47,181
Mr. Santalino: She's not
bad, though, that's all.

843
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,990
Frankie,
would you like some more wine?

844
00:36:51,861 --> 00:36:53,080
Mr. Santalino?

845
00:36:53,123 --> 00:36:54,342
Yeah, gimme a little, then.

846
00:36:54,386 --> 00:36:56,257
Just a little.

847
00:36:56,301 --> 00:36:59,042
Grazie. Grazie.

00:36:59,086 --> 00:37:00,957
Come here.
Come here a second.

849
00:37:01,001 --> 00:37:03,090
See if you can help
me out with something.

850
00:37:03,133 --> 00:37:07,050
I get this real bad
burnin' sensation,

851
00:37:07,094 --> 00:37:08,400
this feeling after I eat,

852
00:37:08,443 --> 00:37:11,054
like, right in here.
Right around, like, in here.

853
00:37:11,098 --> 00:37:13,709
Sometimes, right after,

854
00:37:13,753 --> 00:37:15,450
my heart starts beating so fast

855
00:37:15,494 --> 00:37:17,060
I can't even stand up.

856
00:37:17,104 --> 00:37:18,148
Have you been experiencing

857
00:37:18,192 --> 00:37:21,587
a lot of stress
lately, Mr. Santalino?

858
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:24,111
Nah. I have no problems.

859
00:37:24,154 --> 00:37:26,418
Ok, I think it's acid reflux,

860
00:37:26,461 --> 00:37:28,550
and a drug like Nexium
can take care of it.

861
00:37:28,594 --> 00:37:29,788
There is a surgical procedure,

862
00:37:29,812 --> 00:37:31,553
but I don't think
that you need that.

863
00:37:31,597 --> 00:37:32,685
The rapid heartbeat,

864
00:37:32,728 --> 00:37:34,687
which is called
ventricular tachycardia,

865
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:36,297
can be triggered by the reflux,

866
00:37:36,341 --> 00:37:38,952
and if that doesn't go away for
about 10 minutes afterwards,

867
00:37:38,995 --> 00:37:41,781
then you should take
a beta blocker.

868
00:37:41,824 --> 00:37:42,869
No operation?

869
00:37:42,912 --> 00:37:45,785
No. I don't think so.
You'll be fine.

870
00:37:45,828 --> 00:37:48,266
You are some kid.
Put this in your pocket.

871
00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:49,267
Put it in your pocket.

872
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:50,505
Go ahead, pour the wine.
Thank you.

873
00:37:50,529 --> 00:37:51,965
Thank you.
Thank you.

874
00:37:52,008 --> 00:37:54,315

I'm gonna live.

That's me. Meg.

894
00:38:32,962 --> 00:38:34,288
Thank you for
letting me stay here.

895
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,506
It's been so wonderful
to be able

896
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:37,358
to spend this time
with you, grandma.

897
00:38:37,402 --> 00:38:40,100
I love you so much.

898
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,365
Good.

899
00:38:44,409 --> 00:38:45,801
Waitress: This
is interesting.

900
00:38:45,845 --> 00:38:47,673
Meg: Well, guys,
what do you think?

901
00:38:47,716 --> 00:38:49,762
Raychel: Meg,
why is there a picture

902
00:38:49,805 --> 00:38:53,592
of a dead fuckin' crow
with toe tags on your wall?

903
00:38:53,635 --> 00:38:54,462
It's not my crow.

904
00:38:54,506 --> 00:38:56,334
It came with the apartment.

905
00:38:56,377 --> 00:38:58,074
I... i like it.

906
00:38:58,118 --> 00:38:59,598
I don't know why, but I like it.

907
00:38:59,641 --> 00:39:01,469
See? Thank you, Kate.
Thank you.

908
00:39:01,513 --> 00:39:02,296
You're welcome.

909
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,342
Any more mango margaritas?

910
00:39:04,385 --> 00:39:05,473
You know what?

911
00:39:05,517 --> 00:39:07,562
Other than that dead crow...

912
00:39:07,606 --> 00:39:09,172
You did really good
with this place.

913
00:39:09,216 --> 00:39:10,957
Yeah.
It's really nice.

914
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,393
Thanks.
Cheers.

915
00:39:12,437 --> 00:39:13,351
Cheers.

916
00:39:13,394 --> 00:39:15,309
Congratulations.congratulations.

917
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,310
Congrats.

918
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,356
Thank you.

919
00:39:20,401 --> 00:39:22,882
Now let's talk
about you getting laid.

920
00:39:22,925 --> 00:39:23,709
Meg: What?

921
00:39:23,752 --> 00:39:25,711
[Raychel giggles]

922
00:39:25,754 --> 00:39:26,494
No, thanks.

923
00:39:26,538 --> 00:39:27,582
I... i can do very well

924
00:39:27,626 --> 00:39:29,105
without that complication
in my life,

925
00:39:29,149 --> 00:39:30,237
thank you very much.

926
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,064
What about Frankie?

927
00:39:31,107 --> 00:39:32,544
Frankie is not for her, ok?

928
00:39:32,587 --> 00:39:35,068
Trust me on this?
I know.

929
00:39:35,111 --> 00:39:36,286
That's ok. That's ok,

930
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:38,201
because I'm really
not interested in anybody.

931
00:39:38,245 --> 00:39:40,334
Come on. There's gotta
be somebody. Wh... why?

932
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:43,685
What happened? What, did you get
dumped really bad or something?

933
00:39:43,729 --> 00:39:44,817
Like, what?

934
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:47,123
No, I'm just... I'm
just not... not ready.

935
00:39:47,167 --> 00:39:48,647
Nothing like that.

936
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:50,388
Look, I guarantee you,

937
00:39:50,431 --> 00:39:55,305
whatever it is,
we've all been through it. Right?

938
00:39:55,349 --> 00:39:57,438
Definitely.

939
00:39:57,482 --> 00:39:59,309
So?

940
00:40:00,746 --> 00:40:04,314
Um... ok.

941
00:40:05,664 --> 00:40:08,841
Um, I was engaged
to be married...

942
00:40:08,884 --> 00:40:13,323
And we'd been living
together for about 2 years...

943
00:40:13,367 --> 00:40:16,414
And he was the one.

944
00:40:16,457 --> 00:40:17,850
There was no question about it.

945
00:40:17,893 --> 00:40:23,246
And one night,
we were coming home late from a party,

946
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:27,381
and I was the designated driver,

947
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,600
and he was...

948
00:40:28,643 --> 00:40:29,862
I thought he was asleep,

949
00:40:29,905 --> 00:40:31,385
and all of a sudden,
he popped up,

950
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,300
and he... and he called out,

951
00:40:33,343 --> 00:40:35,302
"hey,
look over there."

952
00:40:35,345 --> 00:40:36,216
And he pointed,

953
00:40:36,259 --> 00:40:39,175
and I turned my head so fast

954
00:40:39,219 --> 00:40:41,264
that the, um...

955
00:40:41,308 --> 00:40:44,006
The right front wheel,

956
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:47,314
it... it... it... it went off
the road into the side,

957
00:40:47,357 --> 00:40:53,276
and... and we started
going into a slide.

958
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,279
And, uh...

959
00:40:56,323 --> 00:40:59,544
After that, I don't really...

960
00:40:59,587 --> 00:41:01,459
I don't remember very much,

961
00:41:01,502 --> 00:41:04,287
except that I heard him scream,

962
00:41:04,331 --> 00:41:09,467
and then we hit
a telephone pole...

963
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:13,079
And, uh...

964
00:41:13,122 --> 00:41:15,255
And he was killed instantly.

965
00:41:15,298 --> 00:41:16,691
And...

966
00:41:16,735 --> 00:41:21,304
And I just had a few
cuts and bruises and...

967
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,791
Holy shit.

968
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,926
Do you know...

969
00:41:33,969 --> 00:41:38,017
Do you know what he
wanted me to look at?

970
00:41:40,846 --> 00:41:44,545
It was... it was a Ferris wheel.

971
00:41:44,589 --> 00:41:49,158
It was a fuckin' Ferris wheel.

972
00:41:53,946 --> 00:41:55,556
Sorry.

973
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,646
How long ago did it happen?

974
00:41:58,690 --> 00:41:59,429
Um,

975
00:41:59,473 --> 00:42:02,302
um, it was about...

976
00:42:02,345 --> 00:42:05,435
I don't know.
It was, uh...

977
00:42:05,479 --> 00:42:08,482
It was... it was...

978
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,703
It was 3 months ago yesterday.

979
00:42:11,746 --> 00:42:14,096
I'm so sorry.

980
00:42:14,923 --> 00:42:18,492
Ok. Ok...

981
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:22,409
This is what we're gonna do.

982
00:42:22,714 --> 00:42:26,587
Next week,
it's me and Kate's birthday, right?

983
00:42:26,631 --> 00:42:27,414
Right.

984
00:42:27,457 --> 00:42:28,371
And what we're gonna do is,

985
00:42:28,415 --> 00:42:29,523
you're gonna
be a part of it, ok?

986
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:32,114
Right? And it's
gonna be, like...

987
00:42:32,158 --> 00:42:34,682
It's gonna be,
like, a rebirthday, ok?

988
00:42:34,726 --> 00:42:36,292
And we're not gonna fuckin' cry,

989
00:42:36,336 --> 00:42:38,817
and we're not gonna
celebrate the fuckin' past.

990
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:41,080
We're gonna
celebrate the future,

991
00:42:41,123 --> 00:42:43,648
because all of us have a lot

992
00:42:43,691 --> 00:42:45,867
to look forward to.

993
00:42:45,911 --> 00:42:48,653
Right?
Yeah.

994
00:42:48,696 --> 00:42:49,697
Thank you. You got it.

995
00:42:49,741 --> 00:42:52,395
Ok, cheers to the rebirthday.

996
00:42:52,439 --> 00:42:53,571
Ok, cheers.

997
00:42:53,614 --> 00:42:55,224
Thank you.

998
00:42:55,268 --> 00:42:56,443
Celebrating life.

999
00:42:56,486 --> 00:42:57,444
Yeah.
Ok.

1000
00:42:57,487 --> 00:42:59,402
You guys are so sweet.
Thank you.

1001
00:42:59,446 --> 00:43:02,580
I need some more fuckin' wine.

1002
00:43:05,539 --> 00:43:07,410
[Easy jazz playing]

1003
00:43:07,454 --> 00:43:09,848
There you are, sir.
Thank you.

1004
00:43:09,891 --> 00:43:13,634
Meg. Hey, can you sit a minute?

1005
00:43:13,678 --> 00:43:14,766
I'm pretty busy.

1006
00:43:14,809 --> 00:43:16,811
Sit down one minute.
It's my restaurant.

1007
00:43:16,855 --> 00:43:19,205
[Chuckles]

1008
00:43:19,248 --> 00:43:21,555
I, uh... i got some
of that medicine

1009
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,732
for my, uh, you know, the agita.

1010
00:43:24,776 --> 00:43:26,038
It's like a miracle potion.

1011
00:43:26,081 --> 00:43:27,996
It was gone,
like it never happened.

1012
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,171
Great.

1013
00:43:29,215 --> 00:43:30,366
You're impressive, kid.
You're impressive.

1014
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:32,261
You know, you really
do know your stuff.

1015
00:43:32,305 --> 00:43:33,088
Oh, you're sweet.

1016
00:43:33,132 --> 00:43:34,263
No, no, you're a good kid.

1017
00:43:34,307 --> 00:43:35,371
Look, let me do the right
thing, will ya?

1018
00:43:35,395 --> 00:43:36,590
Oh, no, no, no.
That's not necessary.

1019
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:37,658
Mr. Santalino,
I don't...

1020
00:43:37,702 --> 00:43:39,617
Honey, we're not
talking necessary, ok?

1021
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,531
You treat me good,
I treat you good.

1022
00:43:41,575 --> 00:43:43,185
It's the way of the world.

1023
00:43:43,229 --> 00:43:44,404
Thank you.

1024
00:43:44,447 --> 00:43:46,058
You know, I was thinkin', um...

1025
00:43:46,101 --> 00:43:49,104
I'd like you to get to
know my son frank better.

1026
00:43:49,148 --> 00:43:50,508
He's a good boy,
the kid, you know?

1027
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:52,978
I... i think you got
a lot in common.

1028
00:43:53,021 --> 00:43:54,283
I'm not really looking...

1029
00:43:54,327 --> 00:43:55,328
Hey, pop.

1030
00:43:55,371 --> 00:43:57,896
Hey, fra... I'm just
talkin' about you.

1031
00:43:57,939 --> 00:43:58,723
Oh, yeah?

1032
00:43:58,766 --> 00:43:59,637
How you doin', Meg?

1033
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,682
I'm good, Frankie.
How are you?

1034
00:44:01,726 --> 00:44:03,075
I'm doin' well.

1035
00:44:03,118 --> 00:44:04,618
You know, you're startin'
to look better and better.

1036
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,513
Oh. Thanks.

1037
00:44:06,556 --> 00:44:08,230
When you first came here,
you were such a klutz.

1038
00:44:08,254 --> 00:44:10,473
You were something more
like the cat dragged in.

1039
00:44:10,517 --> 00:44:14,390
The improvement is really
nothin' short of miraculous.

1040
00:44:16,218 --> 00:44:17,655
Il santalino's been, uh,

1041
00:44:17,698 --> 00:44:19,197
apparently pretty good
for your health,

1042
00:44:19,221 --> 00:44:20,135
right, pop?

1043
00:44:20,179 --> 00:44:22,181
Well, you know, the food here...

1044
00:44:22,224 --> 00:44:23,182
[Chuckles]

1045
00:44:23,225 --> 00:44:24,923
She's a very attractive woman.

1046
00:44:24,966 --> 00:44:26,098
Do you know that he's got

1047
00:44:26,141 --> 00:44:27,708
a college degree,
too? Huh?

1048
00:44:27,752 --> 00:44:29,536
No. I didn't
know that.

1049
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:30,929
Long island university.

1050
00:44:30,972 --> 00:44:32,104
Really?

1051
00:44:32,147 --> 00:44:33,061
What was your major?

1052
00:44:33,105 --> 00:44:36,804
Administration of justice.

1053
00:44:38,632 --> 00:44:42,592
I wanted to learn
how the system worked.

1054
00:44:55,954 --> 00:44:57,738
Meg: So, why did you
abandon the tradition

1055
00:44:57,782 --> 00:45:00,567
of coming here
for your birthday?

1056
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:04,702
[Sighs]
Well, when I was 14,

1057
00:45:04,745 --> 00:45:07,008
my father disappeared,

1058
00:45:07,052 --> 00:45:10,490
and this is, like, our place
to go, and whatever.

1059
00:45:10,533 --> 00:45:12,840
And, um, when he was gone...

1060
00:45:12,884 --> 00:45:16,104
Since he was the only one in my
friggin' family who really gave a shit

1061
00:45:16,148 --> 00:45:17,453
about me at all anyway

1062
00:45:17,497 --> 00:45:18,953
and the only one who ever
remembered my birthday,

1063
00:45:18,977 --> 00:45:21,283
the tradition kind of
went with him.

1064
00:45:21,327 --> 00:45:24,460
So, why come back now?

1065
00:45:25,374 --> 00:45:26,593
Well...

1066
00:45:26,636 --> 00:45:28,136
I don't want you to think
I'm freakin' crazy,

1067
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,640
but you already do anyway,
so... so who cares at this point?

1068
00:45:30,684 --> 00:45:35,123
But, uh, don't get, like,
all full of yourselves, or whatever...

1069
00:45:35,167 --> 00:45:37,778
But seriously, for, like...

1070
00:45:37,822 --> 00:45:39,998
For the first time
in a really long time,

1071
00:45:40,041 --> 00:45:42,435
I kind of feel like
I have a family again.

1072
00:45:42,478 --> 00:45:43,653
You know what I mean?

1073
00:45:43,697 --> 00:45:44,567
That's sweet.

1074
00:45:44,611 --> 00:45:47,570
So it was time to come back.

1075
00:45:47,614 --> 00:45:49,485
You know what I mean?

1076
00:45:49,529 --> 00:45:51,792
How's everything?

1077
00:45:51,836 --> 00:45:53,054
Hi, Angela.

1078
00:45:53,098 --> 00:45:54,621
Everything ok? Very good.

1079
00:45:54,664 --> 00:45:56,362
The clam sauce?
I was worried.

1080
00:45:56,405 --> 00:45:57,711
The best.
Good.

1081
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,669
It was really good,
and I'm not even a clam fan.

1082
00:45:59,713 --> 00:46:01,759
You know what?

1083
00:46:01,802 --> 00:46:02,953
It's so nice to be back here.

1084
00:46:02,977 --> 00:46:04,849
You know what?
You've been gone too long.

1085
00:46:04,892 --> 00:46:05,763
Too long, raychel.

1086
00:46:05,806 --> 00:46:07,416
I know. And I miss
your father.

1087
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:09,568
Thank you. You know,
it's been a little rough in the beginning,

1088
00:46:09,592 --> 00:46:10,961
but now, you know,
it's getting better.

1089
00:46:10,985 --> 00:46:12,030
The place looks so good.

1090
00:46:12,073 --> 00:46:13,311
I know. I'm trying
to keep it the same.

1091
00:46:13,335 --> 00:46:15,598
It looks just like... Joey!
Joey, get over here.

1092
00:46:15,642 --> 00:46:19,167
Get these things off your head.

1093
00:46:19,211 --> 00:46:20,342
Hi, Joey.

1094
00:46:20,386 --> 00:46:22,605
Hi.
[Girls giggle]

1095
00:46:22,649 --> 00:46:24,061
Angela: Look at these
beautiful ladies here.

1096
00:46:24,085 --> 00:46:25,826
That's Meg, and that's Kate.

1097
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:27,436
It's all of our birthdays.

1098
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,655
What do you say?

1099
00:46:28,698 --> 00:46:30,700
Merry Christmas?

1100
00:46:30,744 --> 00:46:31,701
Very funny!

1101
00:46:31,745 --> 00:46:32,746
[Girls giggle]

1102
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:33,616
He's driving me nuts.

1103
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:34,704
What is he, a wisenheimer?

1104
00:46:34,748 --> 00:46:35,986
Is he worse than me
when I was little?

1105
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:37,335
Let's not talk about you
when you were little,

1106
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:38,380
'cause you all had
a nice dinner,

1107
00:46:38,404 --> 00:46:39,804
and we don't want
to ruin it, right?

1108
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:40,928
I'll be right back.

1109
00:46:40,972 --> 00:46:42,253
She used to watch over me.
She's cool.

1110
00:46:42,277 --> 00:46:43,757
You know everybody here.

1111
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:44,758
Well, it's like, you know,

1112
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:45,822
when I was, you know,
growin' up,

1113
00:46:45,846 --> 00:46:47,239
my father, every single year

1114
00:46:47,282 --> 00:46:48,607
he made, like,
a really big deal out of my birthday.

1115
00:46:48,631 --> 00:46:50,633
He would have, like,
freakin' Roman candles

1116
00:46:50,677 --> 00:46:52,810
and what is it, the m-80s?
[Laughs]

1117
00:46:52,853 --> 00:46:54,483
And they would, like,
all blow up outside,

1118
00:46:54,507 --> 00:46:56,857
and I would look out the
window, and it was so nice.

1119
00:46:56,901 --> 00:46:58,119
Raychel... kate: Oh, my god.

1120
00:46:58,163 --> 00:46:59,425
I can't believe you.

1121
00:46:59,468 --> 00:47:03,864
We didn't have the romans,
but happy birthday.

1122
00:47:03,908 --> 00:47:04,952
Thank you so much.

1123
00:47:04,996 --> 00:47:06,476
You're gonna have
good luck this year.

1124
00:47:06,519 --> 00:47:07,694
Oh, thank you.

1125
00:47:07,737 --> 00:47:09,217
It's beautiful, right?

1126
00:47:09,261 --> 00:47:10,871
Let's all make a wish.
Ready?

1127
00:47:10,915 --> 00:47:12,090
Right now.

1128
00:47:12,133 --> 00:47:14,179
Ok, 1, 2, 3.

1129
00:47:14,222 --> 00:47:17,443
Ok, no matter what
happens, next year,

1130
00:47:17,486 --> 00:47:19,401
we're all gonna
be here 7/11, right?

1131
00:47:19,445 --> 00:47:22,056
Birthday girls, rebirthday girl.

1132
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:25,538
All of us together.
Champagne, sparklers, and all.

1133

Happy birthday.

1134
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:28,933
Happy birthday.

1135

Cheers.

1136
00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:32,980
All right, make a pact.
Make a pact.

1137
00:47:33,024 --> 00:47:35,809
Grab your sparkler...

What the fuck is your problem?!

1142
00:47:45,775 --> 00:47:46,907
Do that again.

1143
00:47:46,951 --> 00:47:47,690
Excuse me?

1144
00:47:47,734 --> 00:47:48,735
I said do that again.

1145
00:47:48,778 --> 00:47:50,563
What the fuck
did you say to me?!

1146
00:47:50,606 --> 00:47:51,564
Excuse me.
Forget it.

1147
00:47:51,607 --> 00:47:52,927
Hey, why don't you
pick on someone

1148
00:47:52,957 --> 00:47:54,654
your own fuckin' size, dickhead?

1149
00:47:54,697 --> 00:47:56,047
Move outta my way', bitch...

Excuse me, if it's about fuckin'
her, it's about me.

1151
00:47:57,962 --> 00:47:59,789
Ok, come on. Let's
just get out of here.

1152

Don't even fuckin'
think about it!

All right, let's go.
Let's go.

I wish you had hit him.

It felt so good.
I think I found my forte.

1164
00:48:21,289 --> 00:48:22,725
I like smacking people!

1165
00:48:22,769 --> 00:48:24,945

someone else to smack!

00:52:25,751 --> 00:52:28,077
so make sure you do something
nice with your hair, all right?

1246
00:52:28,101 --> 00:52:29,320
Ok. Thanks.

1247
00:52:29,363 --> 00:52:30,190
I'll walk you out.

1248
00:52:30,234 --> 00:52:32,149
Oh, thanks,
Mr. Santalino.

1249
00:52:32,192 --> 00:52:34,499
I can't tell you how happy
we are with you here.

1250
00:52:34,542 --> 00:52:36,240
You know all my regulars
ask for you now?

1251
00:52:36,283 --> 00:52:40,026
Even Lorenzo occasionally has got
something good to say about you.

1252
00:52:40,069 --> 00:52:41,027
Wow.

1253
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:42,265
Well, I just can't
thank you enough

1254
00:52:42,289 --> 00:52:43,986
for al the good things
you've done for me.

1255
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:46,554
No, don't even mention it.
Don't even mention it.

1256
00:52:46,598 --> 00:52:48,774
You know, raychel...

1257
00:52:48,817 --> 00:52:50,167
She believes in you.

1258
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:53,126
You know, she believes
you could be trusted, huh?

1259
00:52:54,214 --> 00:52:56,129

[Chuckles]

1260
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:58,000
Thanks. you're welcome.

1261
00:52:58,044 --> 00:52:59,741
Come on.

1262
00:52:59,785 --> 00:53:02,135
How is your grandmother?

1263
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,658
My grandmother?

1264
00:53:03,702 --> 00:53:05,201
You know the little Italian
lady that takes care of her?

1265
00:53:05,225 --> 00:53:08,881
She told me that the check
she gets from your parents

1266
00:53:08,924 --> 00:53:12,537
is not really enough
to give her a good life.

1267
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:14,234
I didn't know that
there was a problem.

1268
00:53:14,278 --> 00:53:15,931
Well, it's not
a problem anymore.

1269
00:53:15,975 --> 00:53:17,542
I took care of it.
It's handled, ok?

1270
00:53:17,585 --> 00:53:19,955
Your grandmother's gonna me much
more comfortable from now on.

1271
00:53:19,979 --> 00:53:22,590
Oh, but, you didn't need to do that.
I could...

1272
00:53:22,634 --> 00:53:23,722
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1273
00:53:23,765 --> 00:53:24,766
We're family.

1274
00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:27,508
Families take care of their own.

1275
00:53:27,552 --> 00:53:29,162
Huh?

1276
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:30,990
Ok.

1277
00:53:32,034 --> 00:53:33,210
You're a good girl, Meg.

1278
00:53:33,253 --> 00:53:35,603
You're a fine, fine girl.

1279
00:53:35,647 --> 00:53:36,778
Thank you.

1280
00:53:36,822 --> 00:53:40,086
Go on. Get outta here.
Go home. It's late.

1281
00:53:42,523 --> 00:53:43,785
You'll be all right?

1282
00:53:43,829 --> 00:53:44,830
Yeah, thank you.

1283
00:53:44,873 --> 00:53:47,093
Buona sera.
Buona sera.

1284
00:53:50,444 --> 00:53:52,925
You always had such
pretty, fine hair.

1285
00:53:52,968 --> 00:53:54,405
I remember when I was little,

1286
00:53:54,448 --> 00:53:59,018
you told me that I had your
hair, and I was very happy.

1287
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,848
Things are going
really well right now.

1288
00:54:02,891 --> 00:54:05,198
I've got a great place.

1289
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:06,852
It's really nice...

1290
00:54:06,895 --> 00:54:08,593
And work is going better, and...

1291
00:54:08,636 --> 00:54:10,812
And I have these
2 wonderful friends

1292
00:54:10,856 --> 00:54:12,205
that you would really like.

1293
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:14,990
I think you'd find
them really great.

1294
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:20,909
Grandma...

1295
00:54:22,563 --> 00:54:24,435
I wonder if you ever
took a few steps

1296
00:54:24,478 --> 00:54:26,959
without knowing
where you were going,

1297
00:54:27,002 --> 00:54:30,571
and then you took
a few more steps...

1298
00:54:30,615 --> 00:54:34,532
And all of a sudden,
you found yourself on a different path

1299
00:54:34,575 --> 00:54:38,231
than you ever thought
that you would be on...

1300
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:42,322
And you had no idea
how to turn around.

1301
00:54:48,937 --> 00:54:52,854
I wonder what you would have
done, grandma.

1302
00:54:55,770 --> 00:54:57,294
But then I bet you wouldn't ever

1303
00:54:57,337 --> 00:55:01,863
have been in this
situation to begin with.

1304
00:55:01,907 --> 00:55:04,344
'Cause you were always so good.

1305
00:55:07,869 --> 00:55:10,263
Hey, what are you doin'?

1306
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:11,873
You don't grab
the frickin' bottle.

1307
00:55:11,917 --> 00:55:13,373
Why don't you go cook me something
in the kitchen, all right?

1308
00:55:13,397 --> 00:55:14,635
It's been fun.
We'll get married.

1309
00:55:14,659 --> 00:55:17,836
Hey, I have an
announcement to make...

1310
00:55:17,879 --> 00:55:18,987
Gianni, you touch
my ass tonight,

1311
00:55:19,011 --> 00:55:21,100
you're gettin'
a bottle upside the head.

1312
00:55:21,143 --> 00:55:22,275
Good night, guys.

1313
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:23,513
You know what it is, don't you?

1314
00:55:23,537 --> 00:55:25,452
It's this tacky fuckin'
dress you got on.

1315
00:55:25,496 --> 00:55:27,367
What am I gonna do?
Teresa Marie picked it out.

1316
00:55:27,411 --> 00:55:29,238
Yeah, just 'cause you're
in the wedding party

1317
00:55:29,282 --> 00:55:30,239
don't mean you don't work here.

1318
00:55:30,283 --> 00:55:32,154

You got a problem? No, she don't
got a problem.

1324
00:55:41,207 --> 00:55:43,905
I don't like to be hit on the
ass, but that's ok.

1325
00:55:43,949 --> 00:55:45,124
Excuse me.Gio.

1326
00:55:45,167 --> 00:55:46,038

What is up with him?

1335
00:55:56,744 --> 00:55:58,267
Why is he riding me like that?

1336
00:55:58,311 --> 00:55:59,636
[Whispering] Ok, I wanted to tell
you, he's a little upset

1337
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:02,271
about you knowing about
being a part of the deal.

1338
00:56:02,315 --> 00:56:04,491
"The deal"?
Yeah.

1339
00:56:05,536 --> 00:56:07,165
All right, but don't

They're drunk.
Don't engage with them.

1342

Just do your thing, ok?
Good, good, good. Good night, babe.

1343
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:15,284

You know, you got
so much goin' for you.

1366
00:56:54,846 --> 00:57:00,504
Sometimes, I look in those
big, beautiful brown eyes,

1367
00:57:00,547 --> 00:57:04,551
and I see sadness.

1368
00:57:04,595 --> 00:57:07,032

Hey, that's a good name
for a porno movie, huh?

I cannot believe
the men in this place.

1397
00:57:55,428 --> 00:57:56,690
You want me to smack 'em,

What the fuck is so hard
to understand?

00:58:52,093 --> 00:58:54,182
What the fuck is that?!
Fuck it. I'll get it myself.

1417
00:58:54,226 --> 00:58:55,836
Come on, come on,
come on. Relax, relax.

1418
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:57,969
What's the matter?
Relax. Come on.

1419
00:58:58,012 --> 00:59:01,146
We're having a good time.
Have a drink.

1420
00:59:01,189 --> 00:59:03,104
Come here, sweetie.

1421
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:07,718
I don't know about you,

1422
00:59:07,761 --> 00:59:08,869
but I had it
with that fucking guy.

1423
00:59:08,893 --> 00:59:10,131
You just say the word.
You understand,

1424
00:59:10,155 --> 00:59:13,767
I'll rip his fuckin'
throat out. Capisce?

1425
00:59:24,473 --> 00:59:26,475
Are you gonna be all right?

1426
00:59:27,476 --> 00:59:29,130
Good call.

1427
00:59:31,089 --> 00:59:33,526
He's a really mean drunk.

1428
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,833
Sure you're gonna be all right?

1429
00:59:35,876 --> 00:59:38,923
Fine. You want to
have brunch tomorrow?

1430
00:59:38,966 --> 00:59:40,054
Yeah.
Ok.

1431
00:59:40,098 --> 00:59:42,622
Ok. Bye.
Bye.

1432
00:59:47,061 --> 00:59:48,062
1, 2.

1433
00:59:48,106 --> 00:59:50,456
Thank you, sweetheart.
Thank you.

1434
00:59:50,499 --> 00:59:51,892
Look at this fuckin' girl.

1435
00:59:51,936 --> 00:59:55,679
She's still
fuckin' finishin' up.

1436
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:57,985
That's enough, huh?

1437
00:59:58,029 --> 01:00:01,119
Half an hour ago,
I told her to do this.

1438
01:00:01,162 --> 01:00:02,424
You fuckin' believe it?

1439
01:00:02,468 --> 01:00:04,644
If she was a doctor,
I'd be fuckin' dead by now.

1440
01:00:04,688 --> 01:00:06,080
Ain't that right, puttana?

1441
01:00:06,124 --> 01:00:08,779
If I were a doctor,
I would have let you die by now,

1442
01:00:08,822 --> 01:00:11,477
you misogynistic little prick!

1443
01:00:13,522 --> 01:00:16,047
Excuse me, what the fuck
did you say to me?

1444
01:00:16,090 --> 01:00:17,657
What part didn't you understand?

1445
01:00:17,701 --> 01:00:19,311
"Little prick" or fuck off?!

1446
01:00:19,354 --> 01:00:20,355
Frankie: Beautiful, baby.

1447
01:00:20,399 --> 01:00:21,487
Pull the little prick out.

1448
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:24,621
He's all talk
and no dick, right?

1449
01:00:31,062 --> 01:00:34,500
You fuckin' hit fuckin'
girls, motherfucker?!

1450
01:00:34,543 --> 01:00:37,590
Huh?! Get up,
you son of a bitch!

1451
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:39,636
Get up!

1452
01:00:40,549 --> 01:00:41,725
You all right?

1453
01:00:41,768 --> 01:00:43,727
You sure?

1454
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:45,772
Get up, you piece of shit.

1455
01:00:45,816 --> 01:00:46,860
Hey, hey, enough, enough.

1456
01:00:46,904 --> 01:00:50,298
What is this?
What's happening here?

1457
01:00:59,133 --> 01:01:00,874
You... you did that?

1458
01:01:02,789 --> 01:01:04,704
Gio...

1459
01:01:04,748 --> 01:01:07,315
You like to beat up women.

1460
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:08,839
I... i didn't know that.

1461
01:01:08,882 --> 01:01:11,580
I didn't... I didn't know.

1462
01:01:13,365 --> 01:01:14,366
I... i... i didn't know.

1463
01:01:14,409 --> 01:01:18,326
That bitch... Deserved it.

1464
01:01:18,370 --> 01:01:21,590
She deserved it?
She de...

1465
01:01:21,634 --> 01:01:22,461
Aah! Aah!

1466
01:01:22,504 --> 01:01:24,550
You fuck! You fuck!

1467
01:01:24,593 --> 01:01:26,204
You fucker!

1468
01:01:30,425 --> 01:01:35,343
Pww! You fuck.
I spit in your fuckin' soul.

1469
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:40,697
Look at you.

1470
01:01:41,436 --> 01:01:43,917
Come here. Come here.
Please come here.

1471
01:01:43,961 --> 01:01:46,964
I'm not gonna hurt you. It's me.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1472
01:01:47,007 --> 01:01:48,792
Look at what he did
to your face.

1473
01:01:48,835 --> 01:01:53,187
Hold that there.
Here, baby, baby.

1474
01:01:53,231 --> 01:01:55,581
He was a thief.
He was robbin' us.

1475
01:01:55,624 --> 01:01:57,235
Ok? He was robbing us.

1476
01:01:57,278 --> 01:01:58,671
Don't mean anything.

1477
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,499
Huh, you gonna be ok?

1478
01:02:00,542 --> 01:02:02,022
Uh-huh.
Ok.

1479
01:02:02,066 --> 01:02:04,721
I'm sorry. It's all right.

1480
01:02:04,764 --> 01:02:05,722
I'm ok. I'm ok.

1481
01:02:05,765 --> 01:02:07,027
Mr. Santalino:
I'm sorry.

1482
01:02:07,071 --> 01:02:08,028
Ok. I'm ok.

1483
01:02:08,072 --> 01:02:09,595
Take care of everything. Ok, ok.

1484
01:02:09,638 --> 01:02:12,729
I'm gonna make a phone call.

1485
01:02:15,427 --> 01:02:17,342
Go get me 2 tablecloths.

1486
01:02:17,385 --> 01:02:19,910

2 tablecloths!

1487
01:02:19,953 --> 01:02:21,302

Give it.

1490
01:02:27,265 --> 01:02:29,789
Wrap up his fucking head.

1491
01:02:30,834 --> 01:02:33,750
Wouldn't fuckin' listen,
would you?

1492
01:02:33,793 --> 01:02:34,968
He's... he's... he's alive.

1493
01:02:35,012 --> 01:02:36,709
He's still breathing.
He's still breathing.

1494
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:38,073
Shut up. Wrap up
his fuckin' head.

1495
01:02:38,102 --> 01:02:39,625
But he's alive!
He's alive! Gimme this!

1496
01:02:39,668 --> 01:02:40,582
He's alive!
He's alive!

1497
01:02:40,626 --> 01:02:41,627
We could help him.

1498
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:42,715
Get outta here.Please.

1499
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:44,040

something for him.

1500
01:02:44,064 --> 01:02:45,065
Please, please.

1501
01:02:45,109 --> 01:02:48,155
Get away from him! Frankie... Please.

1502
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:56,468
You can't save him now.

1503
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:58,165
[Sobbing]

1504
01:02:58,209 --> 01:02:59,079
Let's go.

1505
01:02:59,123 --> 01:03:01,647
We got business.
Move!

1506
01:03:02,866 --> 01:03:05,607
Umberto: Yes, steak over
at oneskie's is good.

1507
01:03:05,651 --> 01:03:06,715
Yeah, it's good for nothing.

1508
01:03:06,739 --> 01:03:08,349
Nothing like viencarlugas.

1509
01:03:08,393 --> 01:03:10,830
Viencarlugas oh, to die for.

1510
01:03:10,874 --> 01:03:16,314
To die for. Best cuts of meat
you'll ever have in the world.

1511
01:03:17,706 --> 01:03:20,013
[Speaking Italian]

1512
01:03:20,057 --> 01:03:21,861
I'm telling ya,
the best thing you'll ever taste.

1513
01:03:21,885 --> 01:03:24,670
Nothin' like it. Come on.
Let's get outta here.

1514
01:03:24,713 --> 01:03:27,107
[Sighs]

1515
01:03:41,861 --> 01:03:43,776
Oh, god, what is this place?

1516
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:47,736
It's a surprise.
It's a special surprise.

1517
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:50,783
Oh, frank, what are you doing?

1518
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:53,438
Oh, no.

1519
01:03:53,481 --> 01:03:57,703
At this time, we're in need of
your special and unique talent.

1520
01:03:57,746 --> 01:03:59,183
What are you talking about?

1521
01:03:59,226 --> 01:04:02,621
You know. Just like you med
students do in first year.

1522
01:04:02,664 --> 01:04:04,841
Chop-chop-chop.

1523
01:04:06,103 --> 01:04:09,454
No. No, no, no, no.Yeah.

1524
01:04:09,497 --> 01:04:10,847
No, I won't do that.

1525
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:11,804
Come here!

1526
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:13,719
Come here! Come here.

1527
01:04:13,762 --> 01:04:15,895
No, no!

1528
01:04:16,809 --> 01:04:18,593
It's very simple.
Either you do this,

1529
01:04:18,637 --> 01:04:20,093
or you'll never leave
this fuckin' place alive.

1530
01:04:20,117 --> 01:04:21,466
Do you understand?
You understand?

1531
01:04:21,509 --> 01:04:23,860
Please don't make me do this.
I beg you. I beg you.

1532
01:04:23,903 --> 01:04:25,296
No more talk.
No more talk!

1533
01:04:25,339 --> 01:04:27,820
I beg you, please.

1534
01:04:31,824 --> 01:04:35,088
Cut him into small bits
so he fits in the machine.

1535
01:04:35,132 --> 01:04:36,263
Oh, god, no.

1536
01:04:36,307 --> 01:04:39,049
You do it right,
and nobody ever finds out.

1537
01:04:39,092 --> 01:04:41,486
You're gonna be part
of this now.

1538
01:04:41,529 --> 01:04:43,140
I... can't do that.

1539
01:04:43,183 --> 01:04:46,970
I can't do that.
I just can't.

1540
01:04:47,013 --> 01:04:49,798
You want to live,
or you want to die?

1541
01:04:49,842 --> 01:04:53,585
You don't think I'll do it?

1542
01:04:54,716 --> 01:04:57,241
I'm sure you'll do it.

1543
01:05:06,206 --> 01:05:07,816
Aah!

1544
01:05:15,955 --> 01:05:20,917
Get that gun away from my head.

1545
01:05:23,658 --> 01:05:25,834
Time to operate, doctor.

1546
01:05:59,216 --> 01:06:03,263
[Sawing]

1547
01:06:05,222 --> 01:06:08,877
[Meg breathes hard]

1548
01:06:30,856 --> 01:06:33,032
[Crack and squish]

1549
01:06:33,076 --> 01:06:34,033
And I fucking did it.

1550
01:06:34,077 --> 01:06:35,600
I cut him up into little pieces,

1551
01:06:35,643 --> 01:06:37,167
and I put him into the grinder,

1552
01:06:37,210 --> 01:06:38,883
and then... then they
washed away the blood,

1553
01:06:38,907 --> 01:06:40,711
and they took my dress 'cause
it was covered with blood,

1554
01:06:40,735 --> 01:06:44,087
and they put it in the truck,
and then Mr. Santalino came,

1555
01:06:44,130 --> 01:06:45,044
and he threatened me,

1556
01:06:45,088 --> 01:06:46,959
and then Frankie came.

1557
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:50,006
Frankie wanted
to kiss me good night.

1558
01:06:51,442 --> 01:06:52,965
But I should have
let him fuck me!

1559
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:54,010
That's what I deserve!

1560
01:06:54,053 --> 01:06:55,489
I don't believe this.

1561
01:06:55,533 --> 01:06:58,405
But he had a gun
to my head, right?

1562
01:06:58,449 --> 01:07:00,668
He had a gun, so I...
You know,

1563
01:07:00,712 --> 01:07:02,714
I would have been dead, right?

1564
01:07:03,541 --> 01:07:05,040
There was a moment...
There was one moment

1565
01:07:05,064 --> 01:07:06,955
when I was standing there
in front of gio's naked body

1566
01:07:06,979 --> 01:07:11,201
with all those saws and the
cutters and the meat grinders...

1567
01:07:11,244 --> 01:07:14,073
And... and i... and i...
And I thought,

1568
01:07:14,117 --> 01:07:21,124
"I should just do it. I should just
let Frankie shoot me in the head,

1569
01:07:21,167 --> 01:07:23,126
and then it would be over."

1570
01:07:23,169 --> 01:07:26,346
That's what I should have done.

1571
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:29,262
I couldn't fucking do it!

1572
01:07:29,306 --> 01:07:31,917
I couldn't fucking do it!

1573
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:36,226
My whole fucking life
is a fucking lie!

1574
01:07:37,183 --> 01:07:39,881
Now I just have
to get out of here

1575
01:07:39,925 --> 01:07:41,013
as fast as I possibly can,

1576
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:44,234
and... and... and
please tell raychel

1577
01:07:44,277 --> 01:07:45,409
that I said good-bye.

1578
01:07:45,452 --> 01:07:46,734
I tried to call her,
but she wasn't there,

1579
01:07:46,758 --> 01:07:49,630
and... and... and I just
love you guys so much.

1580
01:07:49,674 --> 01:07:51,023
You've been so wonderful to me,

1581
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:52,696
and I just want
to say good-bye. You can't go, Meg.

1582
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:54,026
What are you doing? Move back.

1583
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:55,680
What... what are you doing?

1584
01:07:55,723 --> 01:07:57,073
You were a witness to a murder.

1585
01:07:57,116 --> 01:07:58,900
You can put these guys away.

1586
01:07:58,944 --> 01:08:00,206
What are you talking about?

1587
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:02,208
Do you know what these
monsters will do to me

1588
01:08:02,252 --> 01:08:04,428
and what they will
do to my grandmother

1589
01:08:04,471 --> 01:08:07,083
if I ever said anything?

1590
01:08:07,126 --> 01:08:08,910
I have to go.

1591
01:08:08,954 --> 01:08:10,129
No!

1592
01:08:10,173 --> 01:08:13,176
Stand back. Get back!

1593
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:19,007
I'm a police officer.

1594
01:08:19,051 --> 01:08:23,142
You're a police officer?

1595
01:08:24,752 --> 01:08:26,972
Kate?

1596
01:08:27,015 --> 01:08:28,321
I'm wired.

1597
01:08:28,365 --> 01:08:30,715
Everything you said about
the murder is on tape.

1598
01:08:30,758 --> 01:08:33,109
In about 2 minutes,
my partners will be up here

1599
01:08:33,152 --> 01:08:34,762
to make sure
you don't go anywhere.

1600
01:08:34,806 --> 01:08:37,156
I didn't want it
to turn out this way.

1601
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,985
I had no choice.
I'm sorry.

1602
01:08:40,028 --> 01:08:43,554
[Siren]

1603
01:08:51,083 --> 01:08:55,087
You're a fucking great actress.

1604
01:08:58,699 --> 01:09:00,155
Officer: Do you
understand the seriousness

1605
01:09:00,179 --> 01:09:01,417
of the charges
that you're facing?

1606
01:09:01,441 --> 01:09:03,182
Kate: This is
bullshit.

1607
01:09:03,226 --> 01:09:05,184
Man: They know what they're doing.
She'll break.

1608
01:09:05,228 --> 01:09:06,490
Look at her.
She doesn't care.

1609
01:09:06,533 --> 01:09:08,144
Threats aren't gonna work.

1610
01:09:08,187 --> 01:09:09,991
Look, when she realizes she can
spend a long time in prison...

1611
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:12,060
She not gonna spend
a day in prison.

1612
01:09:12,104 --> 01:09:13,540
There's not enough hard evidence

1613
01:09:13,584 --> 01:09:15,803
to convince anyone that she
was an accessory to murder.

1614
01:09:15,847 --> 01:09:17,167
We got her on drug trafficking...

1615
01:09:17,196 --> 01:09:18,763
Oh, so I spent
6 months undercover

1616
01:09:18,806 --> 01:09:20,741
to what, bust a waitress,
put her away for 6 months... a year?

1617
01:09:20,765 --> 01:09:22,873
No, wh... she could be convinced it
could be a lot longer than that...

1618
01:09:22,897 --> 01:09:25,073
There is not enough time to
convince her of anything.

1619
01:09:25,117 --> 01:09:26,616
If she doesn't show up to
the restaurant tonight,

1620
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:30,644
she becomes a target,
and we're all out of fucking luck!

1621
01:09:32,733 --> 01:09:33,778
Fine. You go talk to her.

1622
01:09:33,821 --> 01:09:34,929
Oh, I'm not gonna talk to her.

1623
01:09:34,953 --> 01:09:36,563
I'm the last one
she's gonna listen to.

1624
01:09:36,607 --> 01:09:37,695
I don't think so.

1625
01:09:37,738 --> 01:09:38,957
Agency protocol.

1626
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,239
"Undercover do not
interview their targets."

1627
01:09:40,263 --> 01:09:41,979
Yeah, well, I'm making
an exception here, so...

1628
01:09:42,003 --> 01:09:43,459
It is not my job. Well, I'm making it
your job.

1629
01:09:43,483 --> 01:09:45,703
It's not my job! I'm making it
your job.

1630
01:09:45,746 --> 01:09:46,834
It's not my fucking job!

1631
01:09:46,878 --> 01:09:48,160
Jesus, when'd you stop
following orders?

1632
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:49,335
Could you just do
what I fuckin' asked, please?

1633
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:52,013
Fine. Get rid of
the fucking douchebags!

1634
01:09:52,057 --> 01:09:53,363
Fine.

1635
01:09:53,406 --> 01:09:54,601
You want me to do your
fucking job for you, too?

1636
01:09:54,625 --> 01:09:56,366
Oh, man, I fucking
hate this place.

1637
01:09:56,409 --> 01:09:58,585
Yeah, fuck you, asshole.

1638
01:09:59,282 --> 01:10:01,501
[Door shuts]

1639
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:08,769
I'm here to offer you something.

1640
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:12,033
You have an opportunity.

1641
01:10:12,077 --> 01:10:13,165
Yeah, right.

1642
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:16,124
Listen to me.
You don't have to like me.

1643
01:10:16,168 --> 01:10:17,430
I don't.

1644
01:10:17,474 --> 01:10:19,278
You can even hate me.
It really doesn't matter,

1645
01:10:19,302 --> 01:10:20,912
but I suggest you hear me out.

1646
01:10:20,955 --> 01:10:24,220
You have a chance to make
your life right again.

1647
01:10:24,263 --> 01:10:26,483
I don't have a life anymore.

1648
01:10:26,526 --> 01:10:27,658
My life's over.

1649
01:10:27,701 --> 01:10:31,966
[Sighs]

1650
01:10:32,010 --> 01:10:33,533
That's not true.

1651
01:10:35,274 --> 01:10:38,712
I know you didn't intend to consort
with drug dealers and murderers.

1652
01:10:38,756 --> 01:10:40,255
You were just trying
to get back on your feet,

1653
01:10:40,279 --> 01:10:43,021
and along the way,
you made a few bad choices.

1654
01:10:43,064 --> 01:10:44,327
I'm looking at one of them.

1655
01:10:44,370 --> 01:10:47,678
And this is your chance
to make it right again.

1656
01:10:47,721 --> 01:10:50,158
Who are you, the moral police?

1657
01:10:50,202 --> 01:10:52,160
I mean, how dare you
come in here

1658
01:10:52,204 --> 01:10:55,163
and talk to me about
right and wrong?

1659
01:10:55,207 --> 01:10:56,991
I know what I did.

1660
01:10:57,035 --> 01:10:58,341
I know what I did.

1661
01:10:58,384 --> 01:11:01,387
The santalinos were running
a major drug operation

1662
01:11:01,431 --> 01:11:02,606
out of that restaurant.

1663
01:11:02,649 --> 01:11:05,435
You didn't even witness
a fraction of it.

1664
01:11:05,478 --> 01:11:08,089
Our problem has been to get
them with their hands dirty,

1665
01:11:08,133 --> 01:11:10,178
but they're too smart for
that, until the murder.

1666
01:11:10,222 --> 01:11:14,879
Now, you, we, have a chance
to put them away for life.

1667
01:11:14,922 --> 01:11:18,274
You already told us that
they dispose of any evidence

1668
01:11:18,317 --> 01:11:19,405
at the meat plant,

1669
01:11:19,449 --> 01:11:22,365
and unfortunately,
the cold, hard fact is

1670
01:11:22,408 --> 01:11:25,237
that your testimony
will not be enough.

1671
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:27,283
So what do you want from me?

1672
01:11:27,326 --> 01:11:30,416
We want you to go back
into the restaurant wired

1673
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:32,157
and get Frankie
or Mr. Santalino

1674
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:35,769
to talk about the murder,
place themselves at the scene.

1675
01:11:35,813 --> 01:11:37,771
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

1676
01:11:37,815 --> 01:11:41,775
You will be under protective
custody until the trial,

1677
01:11:41,819 --> 01:11:45,301
and then you will go in the
witness protection program.

1678
01:11:45,344 --> 01:11:46,365
The d.E.A. Has connections

1679
01:11:46,389 --> 01:11:48,956
with some very good
medical schools.

1680
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,349
Mm-mmm.

1681
01:11:50,393 --> 01:11:51,872
Go ahead, shake your head,

1682
01:11:51,916 --> 01:11:53,850
but don't be stupid just
'cause you're pissed off at me.

1683
01:11:53,874 --> 01:11:55,223
This is your chance.

1684
01:11:55,267 --> 01:11:59,227
This is your chance to
start your life over again.

1685
01:12:02,187 --> 01:12:04,189
What would happen
to my grandmother?

1686
01:12:04,232 --> 01:12:05,558
This is not about
your grandmother.

1687
01:12:05,582 --> 01:12:08,149
Oh, yes, this is
about my grandmother.

1688
01:12:08,193 --> 01:12:10,848
You know if I do
anything to help you,

1689
01:12:10,891 --> 01:12:13,503
you know what's
gonna happen to her.

1690
01:12:13,546 --> 01:12:18,203
Fine. You give us a written
statement that you will work with us,

1691
01:12:18,246 --> 01:12:19,746
and we will take care
of your grandmother.

1692
01:12:19,770 --> 01:12:24,296
And how do I know that I
can trust you this time?

1693
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:27,560
You are under arrest,
and if you don't show up for work,

1694
01:12:27,604 --> 01:12:31,999
both you and your
grandmother are fucked.

1695
01:12:37,091 --> 01:12:39,659
You fucking callous
little bitch.

1696
01:12:39,703 --> 01:12:41,531
[Door slams]

1697
01:12:42,270 --> 01:12:44,795
You fucking bitch!

1698
01:12:45,099 --> 01:12:49,756
So, the mic is
in the locket, ok?

1699
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:51,845
Now, we got
2 surveillance teams...

1700
01:12:51,889 --> 01:12:54,152
One in the front,
one in the back...

1701
01:12:54,195 --> 01:12:56,850
But inside, you're on your own.

1702
01:12:56,894 --> 01:12:58,243
And nobody does nothing

1703
01:12:58,286 --> 01:13:01,289
until you get Frankie
or santalino

1704
01:13:01,333 --> 01:13:02,987
to talk about gio.

1705
01:13:03,030 --> 01:13:04,225
I just can't believe
that they would

1706
01:13:04,249 --> 01:13:05,946
do anything that stupid.

1707
01:13:05,990 --> 01:13:08,775
If it doesn't work,
we'll try something else.

1708
01:13:08,819 --> 01:13:09,863
Would you cut the shit?

1709
01:13:09,907 --> 01:13:11,406
There is nothing else.
We got one shot.

1710
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:14,694
Shut the fuck up.
You can do it.

1711
01:13:15,695 --> 01:13:18,394
We go in 15.

1712
01:13:21,135 --> 01:13:24,356
So, what about raychel?

1713
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,271
What's gonna happen to her?

1714
01:13:26,314 --> 01:13:27,315
She's a part of it.

1715
01:13:27,359 --> 01:13:30,188
Small-time, but part of it.

1716
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:33,147
Jesus.

1717
01:13:33,191 --> 01:13:36,455
I'll do what I can to help her.

1718
01:13:37,021 --> 01:13:40,459
So thisis where
you change for work?

1719
01:13:40,503 --> 01:13:43,375
I mean, when I called you,
did a phone ring here?

1720
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:47,423
Were you waiting around here?
I don't understand.

1721
01:13:48,641 --> 01:13:51,339
Is your real name even Kate?

1722
01:13:51,383 --> 01:13:54,430
No. No, it's not.

1723
01:13:54,473 --> 01:13:56,127
So, what is it?

1724
01:13:56,170 --> 01:13:57,389
It doesn't matter.

1725
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:59,347
So, what else isn't
true about you?

1726
01:13:59,391 --> 01:14:02,786
The flapper grandmother?
The dancing?

1727
01:14:02,829 --> 01:14:04,178
Obviously the auditions.

1728
01:14:04,222 --> 01:14:05,460
I'll tell you
what's true about me.

1729
01:14:05,484 --> 01:14:08,139
Ever since I was a kid,
I wanted to be a cop.

1730
01:14:08,182 --> 01:14:10,750
And for the last
10 years of my life,

1731
01:14:10,794 --> 01:14:13,144
I've worked my ass off
to get the scumbags

1732
01:14:13,187 --> 01:14:15,320
like the santalinos
off the street.

1733
01:14:15,363 --> 01:14:18,541
For that, I have no apologies.

1734
01:14:19,803 --> 01:14:21,413
And I'll give you 2 more things

1735
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:22,501
that are true about me:

1736
01:14:22,545 --> 01:14:25,896
One, I hated working
in that shithole.

1737
01:14:25,939 --> 01:14:27,506
And two, believe it or not,

1738
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:29,987
I'm gonna miss you and raychel.

1739
01:14:37,298 --> 01:14:39,866
Officer: Ok, time to go.

1740
01:15:03,455 --> 01:15:04,891
Officer: Garcia,
you in position?

1741
01:15:04,935 --> 01:15:09,113
We are in position.
Over.

1742
01:15:09,156 --> 01:15:10,506
10-4.

1743
01:15:15,598 --> 01:15:16,749
Man: Hey, fellas,
how you doing?

1744
01:15:16,773 --> 01:15:19,515
Come on, let's go inside.

1745
01:15:20,472 --> 01:15:21,821
You look very nice tonight.

1746
01:15:21,865 --> 01:15:24,476
Raychel, how 'bout it, huh?

1747
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:26,086
We're hungry.

1748
01:15:27,392 --> 01:15:29,350
Megsie, look...

1749
01:15:29,394 --> 01:15:31,701
Mr. Santalino needs
those appetizers, like,

1750
01:15:31,744 --> 01:15:33,529
sometime this century, ok?

1751
01:15:33,572 --> 01:15:35,661
Ok, I'll do it.
I'll do it. Here.

1752
01:15:35,705 --> 01:15:37,097
Ok, order in.

1753
01:15:37,141 --> 01:15:39,119
Look, I hope you don't mind
taking orders from me, ok?

1754
01:15:39,143 --> 01:15:41,275
I'm just trying to do my job.
You know that, right?

1755
01:15:41,319 --> 01:15:42,320
I don't mind at all.

1756
01:15:42,363 --> 01:15:43,626
Ok. Look, Lorenzo.

1757
01:15:43,669 --> 01:15:45,758
The guy knows.

1758
01:15:45,802 --> 01:15:48,239
You learn something new
every day.

1759
01:15:48,282 --> 01:15:50,197
I'm sorry for the delay.

1760
01:15:51,503 --> 01:15:53,505
It's good to see you
again tonight, Meg.

1761
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:54,898
Thanks, Frankie.

1762
01:15:54,941 --> 01:15:57,465
You're looking more
beautiful than ever.

1763
01:15:57,509 --> 01:15:59,380
I second that fuckin' motion.

1764
01:15:59,424 --> 01:16:00,773
Gianni: Mm-hmm.

1765
01:16:00,817 --> 01:16:02,229
Clean up your language
in front of her.

1766
01:16:02,253 --> 01:16:05,169
Don't you know why
she's special, huh?

1767
01:16:05,212 --> 01:16:06,562
Umberto: Why?

1768
01:16:06,605 --> 01:16:09,913
Because she's as beautiful
inside as she is out, huh?

1769
01:16:09,956 --> 01:16:11,436
Huh?

1770
01:16:11,479 --> 01:16:13,525
Thank you.

1771
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:15,135
Meg: Can I get you
something else?

1772
01:16:15,179 --> 01:16:16,746
I didn't get your bread.

1773
01:16:16,789 --> 01:16:17,964
No, we're in good shape.

1774
01:16:18,008 --> 01:16:19,638
Just your company, honey.
Just your company.

1775
01:16:19,662 --> 01:16:22,142
You stop by later
with us, all right?

1776
01:16:22,186 --> 01:16:22,926
Ok.

1777
01:16:22,969 --> 01:16:25,581
Ok. Thank you.

1778
01:16:30,542 --> 01:16:32,196
Mangia.

1779
01:16:32,239 --> 01:16:33,066
Salute.

1780
01:16:33,110 --> 01:16:34,590
Gianni: She's angelic.

1781
01:16:34,633 --> 01:16:37,288
We'll see.

1782
01:16:40,421 --> 01:16:42,467
How you doing?

1783
01:16:42,510 --> 01:16:44,730
I don't know if I can do this.

1784
01:16:44,774 --> 01:16:45,949
You can do it.

1785
01:16:45,992 --> 01:16:46,732
How ya's doing?

1786
01:16:46,776 --> 01:16:47,820
Great.
Good. Thank you.

1787
01:16:47,864 --> 01:16:49,561
Got everything under control?

1788
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:50,693
Kate: Yeah.

1789
01:16:50,736 --> 01:16:51,476
Ok.

1790
01:16:51,519 --> 01:16:52,433
Congratulations.

1791
01:16:52,477 --> 01:16:56,394
Yeah. Whatever.
Thank you.

1792
01:16:56,916 --> 01:16:58,483
I think
Mr. Santalino knows.

1793
01:16:58,526 --> 01:16:59,484
He was looking at me
really strangely...

1794
01:16:59,527 --> 01:17:00,703
No. Shh.
It's ok. It's ok.

1795
01:17:00,746 --> 01:17:04,141
There goes Frankie
into the back room.

1796
01:17:04,184 --> 01:17:05,621
Go ahead.

1797
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:09,276
You can do it.

1798
01:17:10,451 --> 01:17:11,235
It's ok.

1799
01:17:11,278 --> 01:17:12,149
[Knock on door]

1800
01:17:12,192 --> 01:17:13,367
Frankie: What is it?

1801
01:17:13,411 --> 01:17:14,325
It's Meg.

1802
01:17:14,368 --> 01:17:15,805
Come on in.

1803
01:17:23,508 --> 01:17:24,378
Hi.

1804
01:17:24,422 --> 01:17:26,554
Hey, sweetheart.
How you doing?

1805
01:17:26,598 --> 01:17:28,469
Not so good.

1806
01:17:28,513 --> 01:17:29,688
Could I have some aspirin?

1807
01:17:29,732 --> 01:17:31,777
My head, it feels like
it's about to explode.

1808
01:17:31,821 --> 01:17:33,953
Yeah. Sure.

1809
01:17:34,824 --> 01:17:37,478
Why don't you have a seat?

1810
01:17:40,438 --> 01:17:42,745
2 aspirin comin' up.

1811
01:17:42,788 --> 01:17:43,702
Thanks.

1812
01:17:43,746 --> 01:17:45,878
[Sniffles]

1813
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:51,318
What's the problem,
sweetheart? Rough night?

1814
01:17:51,362 --> 01:17:52,711
[Laughs]

1815
01:17:52,755 --> 01:17:57,063
I haven't been able to eat
or sleep since last night.

1816
01:17:58,108 --> 01:18:00,414
I keep seeing gio's bloody face

1817
01:18:00,458 --> 01:18:02,590
in front of my eyes. I...

1818
01:18:03,896 --> 01:18:05,550
Shh...

1819
01:18:05,593 --> 01:18:07,552
I don't know how to handle it.

1820
01:18:07,595 --> 01:18:09,641
Here.

1821
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:12,383
It's gonna be ok.

1822
01:18:16,430 --> 01:18:18,868
That better?

1823
01:18:19,956 --> 01:18:21,566
Yeah.

1824
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:23,568
Don't stress.

1825
01:18:23,611 --> 01:18:25,483
Everything's gonna be fine.

1826
01:18:25,526 --> 01:18:26,571
I promise.

1827
01:18:26,614 --> 01:18:28,747
[Laughs]

1828
01:18:28,791 --> 01:18:31,010
Look at you.

1829
01:18:31,054 --> 01:18:34,318
You're so calm.

1830
01:18:35,275 --> 01:18:38,888
How do you remain
in control like that?

1831
01:18:38,931 --> 01:18:41,586
I have other things on my mind.

1832
01:18:41,629 --> 01:18:43,370
[Laughs]

1833
01:18:43,414 --> 01:18:45,416
Yeah?

1834
01:18:45,459 --> 01:18:47,374
Like what?

1835
01:18:49,942 --> 01:18:53,032
It's the first time
I have you alone.

1836
01:18:55,078 --> 01:18:58,037
[Whispering]
You're so beautiful.

1837
01:18:59,778 --> 01:19:01,084
I'm sorry.

1838
01:19:01,127 --> 01:19:02,085
It's ok.

1839
01:19:02,128 --> 01:19:03,695
I'm sorry that I fought you.

1840
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:05,741
It's ok. It's ok.

1841
01:19:05,784 --> 01:19:10,006
You're so much stronger
than me. It's never...

1842
01:19:12,835 --> 01:19:16,099
But why did you
have to kill him?

1843
01:19:16,142 --> 01:19:17,535
Couldn't you have
just beaten him?

1844
01:19:17,578 --> 01:19:21,060
Why did you have to kill him?

1845
01:19:35,205 --> 01:19:38,730
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

1846
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:41,689
Would you excuse me
for a second?

1847
01:19:41,733 --> 01:19:43,604
I have to make a phone call.

1848
01:19:43,648 --> 01:19:44,910
Frankie: Thank you.

1849
01:19:44,954 --> 01:19:48,609
Meg:
Thanks for the aspirin.

1850
01:19:48,653 --> 01:19:51,308
My pleasure.

1851
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:56,269
[Door closes]

1852
01:20:26,734 --> 01:20:28,475
Everything's quiet.

1853
01:20:28,519 --> 01:20:31,261
Officer: 10-4.

1854
01:20:35,526 --> 01:20:38,572
Hey, what are you doing
back here working so hard?

1855
01:20:38,616 --> 01:20:39,791
What are you talking about?

1856
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:41,160
Well, you're always
the first one to leave.

1857
01:20:41,184 --> 01:20:42,509
What are you doing? Go home.
I'll do this for you.

1858
01:20:42,533 --> 01:20:45,405
I'm the manager now.
It's my job to close up.

1859
01:20:45,449 --> 01:20:46,145
You know?

1860
01:20:46,189 --> 01:20:47,755
Yeah, but I could do it.

1861
01:20:47,799 --> 01:20:50,454
It's fine. I don't mind.
You should just go home.

1862
01:20:50,497 --> 01:20:52,891
What's goin' on with you?
You havin' a little trouble

1863
01:20:52,935 --> 01:20:54,371
taking orders from me
or something?

1864
01:20:54,414 --> 01:20:56,025
What's goin' on?

1865
01:20:56,068 --> 01:20:58,394
[Whispering] Raychel, listen to me.
You have to get out of here.

1866
01:20:58,418 --> 01:20:59,593
What are you talking about?

1867
01:20:59,637 --> 01:21:00,657
You gotta get out of here.

1868
01:21:00,681 --> 01:21:02,422
Just trust me.
I can't explain why.

1869
01:21:02,466 --> 01:21:03,467
What's going on?

1870
01:21:03,510 --> 01:21:04,598
Everything ok?

1871
01:21:04,642 --> 01:21:06,098
Yeah, everything is
just fine and dandy.

1872
01:21:06,122 --> 01:21:08,341
I was just saying that
raychel looked a little tired,

1873
01:21:08,385 --> 01:21:09,705
and in honor of her
being manager,

1874
01:21:09,734 --> 01:21:12,737
I thought that you and me
could close up for her.

1875
01:21:12,780 --> 01:21:15,653
I think it's up to raychel
to do what she wants to do.

1876
01:21:15,696 --> 01:21:18,482
Thank you.
I'll do my job.

1877
01:21:18,525 --> 01:21:19,439
Goddamn you, Kate.

1878
01:21:19,483 --> 01:21:20,832
Why can't you do
something decent

1879
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:22,070
for a change?
She's our friend.

1880
01:21:22,094 --> 01:21:24,227
I'm aware that
raychel's our friend.

1881
01:21:24,270 --> 01:21:25,315
What the hell is going on?

1882
01:21:25,358 --> 01:21:26,925
Frankie: Lay out
the champagne, boys.

1883
01:21:26,969 --> 01:21:29,232
Time to toast our new manager.

1884
01:21:29,275 --> 01:21:31,321
Hey, now.
How you doing?

1885
01:21:31,364 --> 01:21:32,931
Umberto:
Hello, baby, to you.

1886
01:21:32,975 --> 01:21:34,193
I get a freakin' toast now?

1887
01:21:34,237 --> 01:21:35,954
Frankie: Of course, baby.
You deserve it, huh?

1888
01:21:35,978 --> 01:21:36,979
You deserve it.

1889
01:21:37,022 --> 01:21:38,086
Oh, thank you.
I'm trying to class up

1890
01:21:38,110 --> 01:21:39,851
my act a little,
you know what I mean?

1891
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:40,765
You clean up real nice.

1892
01:21:40,808 --> 01:21:41,679
You're the best.

1893
01:21:41,722 --> 01:21:43,986
To raychel.
She's the best.

1894
01:21:44,029 --> 01:21:45,857
Yeah, to raych.

1895
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:48,425
Cheers. Ba bing.

1896
01:21:48,468 --> 01:21:49,643
Success.

1897
01:21:49,687 --> 01:21:50,775
Umberto: To you, baby.

1898
01:21:50,818 --> 01:21:52,231
Frankie: Give me
some more of that, huh?

1899
01:21:52,255 --> 01:21:54,953
We're almost out.
It's the hostess with the most-ess.

1900
01:21:54,997 --> 01:21:56,694
Oh, it's going to my head.

1901
01:21:56,737 --> 01:21:58,087
I gotta get back to work.

1902
01:21:58,130 --> 01:22:01,003
Umberto:
Don't want some more?

1903
01:22:10,751 --> 01:22:14,320
Hello. I came back
like you asked.

1904
01:22:14,364 --> 01:22:16,714
Great. Sit down.

1905
01:22:23,199 --> 01:22:26,376
I've been thinking a lot
in the last 24 hours,

1906
01:22:26,419 --> 01:22:28,465
and, uh...

1907
01:22:30,032 --> 01:22:31,729
You see...

1908
01:22:32,991 --> 01:22:34,950
All my life...

1909
01:22:34,993 --> 01:22:36,299
I've somehow been involved

1910
01:22:36,342 --> 01:22:38,779
with guys like gio,

1911
01:22:38,823 --> 01:22:41,217
guys who would, uh,

1912
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:44,307
abuse me or hurt me,

1913
01:22:44,350 --> 01:22:47,701
either with their fists
or with their words,

1914
01:22:47,745 --> 01:22:49,834
and sometimes it was both.

1915
01:22:49,877 --> 01:22:52,445
You know what I'm saying?

1916
01:22:54,230 --> 01:22:57,015
And, uh...

1917
01:22:57,059 --> 01:23:00,932
And all my life,
I never had anyone...

1918
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:06,024
To defend me
from those monsters.

1919
01:23:06,068 --> 01:23:08,679
Until last night.

1920
01:23:09,897 --> 01:23:15,033
And I just want to thank you...

1921
01:23:15,860 --> 01:23:20,212
Because I never realized
how much I needed...

1922
01:23:20,256 --> 01:23:23,999
Someone to do that for me.

1923
01:23:25,435 --> 01:23:27,350
Someone to...

1924
01:23:27,393 --> 01:23:29,917
Be my hero.

1925
01:23:30,788 --> 01:23:33,051
I just wanted to thank you.

1926
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:35,053
[Sniffling]
That's it.

1927
01:23:35,097 --> 01:23:37,925
That's all I want to say.

1928
01:23:37,969 --> 01:23:38,970
Meg.

1929
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:42,582
Come here.
Sit a minute.

1930
01:23:50,068 --> 01:23:50,895
[Sighs]

1931
01:23:50,938 --> 01:23:53,550
Can I make you a promise?

1932
01:23:55,291 --> 01:23:57,119
If any person

1933
01:23:57,162 --> 01:23:59,773
ever lays their hands on you
