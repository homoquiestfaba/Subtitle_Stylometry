00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:50,773
<i>Money is sizeable.</i>

3
00:00:50,775 --> 00:00:52,374
<i>It will destroy
the crime syndicate.</i>

4
00:00:52,376 --> 00:00:53,408
Oh, there!

5
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:54,744
Perhaps I didn't make myself

6
00:00:54,746 --> 00:00:56,466
clear enough
at the board meeting last week.

7
00:00:57,549 --> 00:01:01,416
It was my father's company,
it is now my company.

8
00:01:01,418 --> 00:01:02,919
But the money will go
to Maha Jaya.

9
00:01:02,921 --> 00:01:04,086
We are done here.

10
00:01:05,389 --> 00:01:06,556
Hi, Tian Xiao Xian.

11
00:01:06,558 --> 00:01:08,423
I'm Madame Liang,
head of Embassy Security.

12
00:01:08,425 --> 00:01:10,225
The ambassador has asked me
to look after you.

13
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:13,696
Call me Xiao Xian.

14
00:01:22,474 --> 00:01:23,773
<i>With the increasing</i>

15
00:01:23,775 --> 00:01:24,574
<i>economic impact</i>

00:01:24,576 --> 00:01:26,609

18
00:01:28,513 --> 00:01:29,879
<i>have been on the rise.</i>

19
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,581
<i>The Chinese embassy

20
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:32,582

21
00:01:32,584 --> 00:01:35,083

22
00:01:35,085 --> 00:01:36,686

24
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,524
<i>there is cause

25
00:01:41,526 --> 00:01:43,392
Chinese heiress, Tian Xiao Xian,

26
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:44,561
<i>has just arrived
in Maha Jaya</i>

27
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,930
<i>with a plan
to take down the syndicate.</i>

28
00:03:11,516 --> 00:03:14,449
That thing won't work out here.

29
00:03:14,451 --> 00:03:18,087
Those guys, they're our GPS
and navigation system.

30
00:03:18,089 --> 00:03:19,589
That's why we brought 'em.

31
00:03:50,454 --> 00:03:52,624
Ah, there you are.

32
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:56,761
Look at you, looking all dapper.

33
00:03:59,564 --> 00:04:01,365
Time to ruin your day.

34
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:05,402
We're in business.

35
00:05:21,378 --> 00:05:22,446
Shh.

36
00:05:23,481 --> 00:05:24,714
Don't speak, love.

37
00:05:24,716 --> 00:05:26,314
Don't leave me.

38
00:06:04,321 --> 00:06:05,490
Hey!

39
00:06:35,452 --> 00:06:36,586
What did I tell you?

40
00:06:36,588 --> 00:06:38,921
Watch your six. Pay attention.

41
00:06:38,923 --> 00:06:40,925
You know
I can take care of myself.

42
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,066
What are you doing?

43
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:26,068
Let's go.

44
00:07:36,147 --> 00:07:37,147
Here, grab this.

45
00:07:57,568 --> 00:07:58,888
Do not move.

46
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,638
Good morning.

47
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,575
Do you have any idea
what you're doing?

48
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,479
Yeah, I'm pretty sure I do.

49
00:08:10,481 --> 00:08:12,315
There's a cost here.

50
00:08:12,317 --> 00:08:14,050
Think twice before you continue.

51
00:08:14,052 --> 00:08:16,120
If there's a cost,
put it on my credit card.

52
00:08:17,588 --> 00:08:20,556
So, you must be the big boss.

53
00:08:20,558 --> 00:08:22,425
Kinda tall to be a Burmese.

54
00:08:22,427 --> 00:08:23,492
I'm Indonesian.

55
00:08:23,494 --> 00:08:26,429
Oh, okay, my bad, Indonesian.

56
00:08:26,431 --> 00:08:27,630
And you to us?

57
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,999
Maybe you and I
could make a deal?

58
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:41,110
Colonel, we found him
at the north side of the camp.

59
00:08:41,112 --> 00:08:43,012
Let's take ol' white collar
with us.

60
00:08:43,014 --> 00:08:45,249
Pretty sure Collins
hasn't had his breakfast yet.

61
00:08:46,918 --> 00:08:49,352
Don't shoot!
We're with the Americans!

62
00:08:49,354 --> 00:08:51,387
We had an agreement
with the mercies!

63
00:09:04,302 --> 00:09:06,637
Hey, where's
the women and children?

64
00:09:23,087 --> 00:09:25,187
Hey.

65
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,989
Leave that alone.

66
00:09:26,991 --> 00:09:29,158
He said leave that alone.

67
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,762
So leave it alone.

68
00:09:33,831 --> 00:09:35,231
Get the thermite cutter.

69
00:09:37,902 --> 00:09:39,937
You're making the biggest
mistake of your life.

70
00:09:41,906 --> 00:09:44,440
The man is a major terrorist.

71
00:09:44,442 --> 00:09:46,778
You think my agency
is just gonna let this go?

72
00:10:03,694 --> 00:10:05,628
You better pray
he's still alive.

73
00:10:12,036 --> 00:10:13,036
Yeah.

74
00:10:29,987 --> 00:10:33,122
Don't think
you're gonna enjoy your freedom.

75
00:10:33,124 --> 00:10:35,626
You're gonna bring
a world of hurt onto yourselves.

76
00:10:51,909 --> 00:10:54,643
I told you you'd be beggin'
on your knees tonight.

77
00:10:54,645 --> 00:10:55,746
Go to hell.

78
00:10:57,081 --> 00:10:58,247
You first.

79
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:17,468
Here you go.

80
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,103
Spa treatment is over, Collins.

81
00:11:21,105 --> 00:11:23,239
Let's torch this place
and get out of here.

82
00:11:23,241 --> 00:11:24,306
No evidence.

83
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:28,144
We burn this place
and everyone in it.

84
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:30,882
Your clothes, mate.
You might need them.

85
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,484
Maybe a shower. You stink.

86
00:13:13,451 --> 00:13:16,954
Forgive me
for what I have to do.

87
00:13:22,494 --> 00:13:23,494
I have no choice.

88
00:14:04,001 --> 00:14:06,969
Su Feng, Collins
has been extracted.

89
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,103
I'm glad we could

90
00:14:08,105 --> 00:14:09,204
put aside our differences
on this.

91
00:14:09,206 --> 00:14:10,640
He's a loose cannon.

92
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:13,442
I think it's a mistake,
but it's your play.

93
00:14:13,444 --> 00:14:14,877
We're square now.

94
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:16,579
One more thing.

95
00:14:16,581 --> 00:14:17,882
Get me her itinerary.

96
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,066
They are in the arena.

97
00:14:36,601 --> 00:14:38,869
It better be
the two men I'm looking for.

98
00:14:45,042 --> 00:14:46,322
Here you go.

99
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:43,600
Five. Okay? Five hundred.

100
00:16:08,693 --> 00:16:09,693
Five.

101
00:16:20,204 --> 00:16:23,172
Payu! We're on! Let's go!

102
00:16:27,813 --> 00:16:28,912
Yeah!

103
00:16:31,348 --> 00:16:32,450
Let's beat him!

104
00:17:24,903 --> 00:17:26,170
- Hey, come on!
- Come on!

105
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,414
Yeah!

106
00:18:09,581 --> 00:18:11,181
Hey! Huh?

107
00:18:12,584 --> 00:18:13,752
I want in.

108
00:18:15,587 --> 00:18:17,656
- I'll pay you.
- Okay.

109
00:18:33,437 --> 00:18:35,372
- Yeah!
- Bro.

110
00:18:45,884 --> 00:18:49,554
Place a bet more. Place more.

111
00:19:04,836 --> 00:19:05,902
Come on!

112
00:19:14,378 --> 00:19:17,414
Remember me? Huh?
I remember you.

113
00:19:18,717 --> 00:19:20,315
You killed my wife.

114
00:19:20,317 --> 00:19:22,852
For this, I will kill you.

115
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:10,834
Shit!

116
00:20:43,134 --> 00:20:44,234
Come on!

117
00:20:56,413 --> 00:20:57,814
That's the guy from the camp.

118
00:20:57,816 --> 00:20:58,816
Yeah.

119
00:21:00,317 --> 00:21:01,418
Give me a hand.

120
00:21:16,134 --> 00:21:17,234
How is he?

121
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,302
He's lost a lot of blood.

122
00:21:20,304 --> 00:21:21,740
He needs food.

123
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:24,308
I made one for him.

124
00:21:26,343 --> 00:21:27,877
He was trying to kill me.

125
00:21:27,879 --> 00:21:29,413
I would do the same.

126
00:21:49,134 --> 00:21:50,300
We need to talk.

127
00:22:00,145 --> 00:22:02,614
I buried many of my friends
because of you two.

128
00:22:03,481 --> 00:22:04,947
It's not what you think.

129
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:06,849
You were with the killers
that came into my camp.

130
00:22:06,851 --> 00:22:09,521
We were told we were
on a humanitarian mission,

131
00:22:10,522 --> 00:22:12,289
but we were lied to.

132
00:22:14,592 --> 00:22:16,728
Hey! What about the prisoners?

133
00:22:18,196 --> 00:22:20,696
Oh, yeah, yeah, um, Dom,

134
00:22:20,698 --> 00:22:22,799
reunite them with the prisoners.

135
00:22:28,573 --> 00:22:30,840
This place reminds me
of Boy Scout camp.

136
00:22:30,842 --> 00:22:32,475
In you go.

137
00:22:32,477 --> 00:22:33,945
A bunch of assholes there
as well.

138
00:22:37,381 --> 00:22:39,081
Five-minute fuse, Collins.

139
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:41,519
Fuck it up, Mook.

140
00:22:52,864 --> 00:22:53,864
Come push me.

141
00:23:05,844 --> 00:23:07,910
Get out of here!

142
00:23:07,912 --> 00:23:10,513
Come, come, come.
Come on. It's about to explode.

143
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:11,581
Go! Go!

144
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:12,684
Go! Go!

145
00:23:13,551 --> 00:23:14,617
Come on!

146
00:23:14,619 --> 00:23:16,252
How long do we have?

147
00:23:16,254 --> 00:23:18,521
CL-21 explosive device.

148
00:23:18,523 --> 00:23:19,724
Less than one minute.

149
00:23:20,491 --> 00:23:22,357
I can't diffuse this.

150
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,327
- Go, go, go!
- Go!

151
00:23:24,329 --> 00:23:26,329
Everybody out, out!

152
00:23:26,331 --> 00:23:27,498
- Go!
- No, you go!

153
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:48,951
We didn't fire our weapons.

154
00:23:48,953 --> 00:23:50,753
We thought we were doing
something good.

155
00:23:50,755 --> 00:23:52,788
Yeah, no good there.

156
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:56,459
We were double-crossed
and left for dead.

157
00:23:56,461 --> 00:23:57,996
We are after the same men.

158
00:23:59,597 --> 00:24:00,930
Who are they?

159
00:24:00,932 --> 00:24:02,500
Some kind of criminal gang.

160
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:05,301
Really bad guys.

161
00:24:05,303 --> 00:24:08,104
What were you doing at a camp?

162
00:24:08,106 --> 00:24:10,539
My men and I
were paid to guard the place.

163
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:11,607
It was just a job.

164
00:24:11,609 --> 00:24:13,209
We are soldiers for hire.

165
00:24:13,211 --> 00:24:14,844
Everyone uses us.

166
00:24:14,846 --> 00:24:15,846
So,

167
00:24:16,981 --> 00:24:18,413
what's your plan?

168
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:21,651
Make money, finance, resupply.

169
00:24:21,653 --> 00:24:23,953
And then, it's payback.

170
00:24:23,955 --> 00:24:25,590
Yeah.

171
00:24:29,327 --> 00:24:30,561
Not much of a plan.

172
00:24:31,496 --> 00:24:32,964
You have a better idea?

173
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:38,901
Perhaps, we can work together.

174
00:24:38,903 --> 00:24:41,971
I have a lot of contacts.
I can find anyone.

175
00:24:41,973 --> 00:24:43,007
But first...

176
00:24:45,343 --> 00:24:46,945
a toast.

177
00:24:55,253 --> 00:24:56,252
To new friends.

178
00:24:56,254 --> 00:24:58,154
- To new friends.
- To new friends.

179
00:24:58,156 --> 00:24:59,156
Yeah.

180
00:25:06,264 --> 00:25:08,230
One more, don't be shy.

181
00:25:08,232 --> 00:25:09,699
Yup.

182
00:25:09,701 --> 00:25:12,203
Yeah.

183
00:25:20,044 --> 00:25:21,924
My father loved it here.

184
00:25:25,416 --> 00:25:27,116
How is the ambassador?

185
00:25:27,118 --> 00:25:28,951
He was a good friend
of my father.

186
00:25:28,953 --> 00:25:30,219
He's doing well.

187
00:25:30,221 --> 00:25:31,923
He speaks highly of your father.

188
00:25:35,793 --> 00:25:38,861
We'll arrive
for your interview in an hour.

189
00:25:38,863 --> 00:25:40,596
I just want to say
how much I admire the work

190
00:25:40,598 --> 00:25:42,031
you've been doing here
for the past week.

191
00:25:42,033 --> 00:25:43,467
Thanks.
I'm not sure I deserve it.

192
00:25:43,469 --> 00:25:46,435
Well, I think you do.
And so do a lot of others.

193
00:25:46,437 --> 00:25:47,703
Thank you.
It's good to hear that.

194
00:25:47,705 --> 00:25:49,265
Sometimes I feel like
I'm walking alone.

195
00:26:00,218 --> 00:26:01,218
What?

196
00:26:06,224 --> 00:26:07,523
He's gone.

197
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:09,892
I didn't hear him leave.

198
00:26:09,894 --> 00:26:12,128
I guess
he did not like my cooking.

199
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:14,163
- Yeah, well...
- Yeah.

200
00:26:14,165 --> 00:26:15,297
There is that.

201
00:26:33,284 --> 00:26:34,484
I think we've been set up.

202
00:26:34,486 --> 00:26:35,586
What?

203
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:40,291
Freeze! Put your hands
above your head. Don't move!

204
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:43,728
- Handcuffs! Bring them out!
- Okay, officer.

205
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:04,282
Oh, man.

206
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:26,802
Yes?

207
00:27:26,804 --> 00:27:28,604
This is a message for Collins.

208
00:27:28,606 --> 00:27:29,939
<i>Collins?</i>

209
00:27:29,941 --> 00:27:31,240
No one here by that name.

210
00:27:31,242 --> 00:27:33,678
Trust me,
he'll wanna know.

211
00:27:36,482 --> 00:27:39,682
You have a message for Collins,
you can talk to me.

212
00:27:39,684 --> 00:27:40,449
<i>Tell him</i>

213
00:27:40,451 --> 00:27:41,617
<i>that the two chaps
from the jungle raid</i>

214
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:43,821
<i>are in custody
at Central Police Station.</i>

215
00:28:00,606 --> 00:28:02,539
You take me
to the nicest places.

216
00:28:05,877 --> 00:28:07,812
Are you being sent
back to China?

217
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,914
The gang
took everything from us.

218
00:28:11,916 --> 00:28:13,784
I didn't want it to be this way.

219
00:28:28,733 --> 00:28:29,867
Pa?

220
00:28:33,572 --> 00:28:35,673
I want to go home.

221
00:28:38,109 --> 00:28:39,377
<i>I want to go home.</i>

222
00:28:57,862 --> 00:29:00,162
Miss Tian,
we're so pleased to have you.

223
00:29:00,164 --> 00:29:01,430
We'd like to lead
into the interview

224
00:29:01,432 --> 00:29:02,998
with some background
about your father,

225
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,333
your inheritance.

226
00:29:04,335 --> 00:29:05,367
Would that be all right?

227
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:06,802
Let's try to keep
the personal questions

228
00:29:06,804 --> 00:29:07,870
to a minimum.

229
00:29:07,872 --> 00:29:09,171
I'm here for the charity.

230
00:29:09,173 --> 00:29:11,042
- Okay, sure, understand.
- Great.

231
00:29:17,616 --> 00:29:19,616
<i>The two guides
you used in the jungle</i>

232
00:29:19,618 --> 00:29:21,484
<i>are down at the Central
Police Station.</i>

233
00:29:21,486 --> 00:29:24,322
Central Police Station? Really?

234
00:29:26,457 --> 00:29:28,457
Well, that is very interesting.

235
00:29:28,459 --> 00:29:31,260
I suggest you take care
of this immediately.

236
00:29:31,262 --> 00:29:32,262
Understood.

237
00:29:34,198 --> 00:29:35,798
Those two little jungle rats

238
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,733
who shouldn't have survived
that explosion.

239
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:38,834
That's not possible.

240
00:29:38,836 --> 00:29:40,803
We piled enough composition four
in those cages

241
00:29:40,805 --> 00:29:42,071
to kill everything
in the vicinity.

242
00:29:42,073 --> 00:29:43,973
Well, two resilient inmates
at Central

243
00:29:43,975 --> 00:29:45,209
would disagree with you.

244
00:29:46,077 --> 00:29:48,143
Let's stay focused in on point.

245
00:29:48,145 --> 00:29:50,014
We'll deal with those mavericks
as and when.

246
00:29:54,051 --> 00:29:56,151
Crimes against
the local Chinese community.

247
00:29:56,153 --> 00:29:57,820
<i>Have been on the rise.</i>

248
00:29:57,822 --> 00:29:59,321
Chinese heiress, Tian Xiao Xian,

249
00:29:59,323 --> 00:30:01,824
<i>will join Damon live
in the studio today</i>

250
00:30:01,826 --> 00:30:03,025
<i>to talk about her plans</i>

251
00:30:03,027 --> 00:30:05,595
<i>to push back
against the syndicate.</i>

252
00:30:05,597 --> 00:30:07,062
<i>You know her
as the daughter</i>

253
00:30:07,064 --> 00:30:08,665
<i>of Chinese real estate mogul,</i>

254
00:30:08,667 --> 00:30:11,166
Tian Wai Gow.

255
00:30:11,168 --> 00:30:14,471
She's the heiress who set aside
her pampered life,

256
00:30:14,473 --> 00:30:16,972
and shared her wealth
with those in need.

257
00:30:16,974 --> 00:30:20,843
Since her father's passing,
she has devoted herself

258
00:30:20,845 --> 00:30:23,279
and her family's fortune
to philanthropy,

259
00:30:23,281 --> 00:30:27,116
crime prevention,
and corruption in our city.

260
00:30:27,118 --> 00:30:30,452
It's my distinct pleasure
to welcome Miss Xiao Xian.

261
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:31,454
Thank you, Damon.

262
00:30:32,256 --> 00:30:34,089
You were born to wealth.

263
00:30:34,091 --> 00:30:37,028
You've never had to work
unless you decided to do so.

264
00:30:38,429 --> 00:30:39,562
So, why?

265
00:30:39,564 --> 00:30:43,899
Why take such a risk
in such a dangerous cause?

266
00:30:43,901 --> 00:30:45,968
My father grew up here.

267
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:49,706
And Maha Jaya
is a very special place to him.

268
00:30:49,708 --> 00:30:52,441
<i>Children don't have
the luxury of playing outside,</i>

269
00:30:52,443 --> 00:30:54,711
<i>because it's simply not safe.</i>

270
00:30:54,713 --> 00:30:57,446
<i>The investment allows us
to build the infrastructure,</i>

271
00:30:57,448 --> 00:30:59,281
<i>so that the people
of this country</i>

272
00:30:59,283 --> 00:31:01,618
can have access to an education,

273
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:04,188
<i>creating real jobs
and, in turn, an economy.</i>

274
00:31:05,624 --> 00:31:08,457
My father told me
that the greatest wealth

275
00:31:08,459 --> 00:31:11,795
is being able to live a life
of service to others.

276
00:31:11,797 --> 00:31:15,498
<i>I want nothing more
than to give these people</i>

277
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,067
<i>the same chance
that I was given,</i>

278
00:31:18,069 --> 00:31:21,571
<i>so they can experience
the joy of family,</i>

279
00:31:21,573 --> 00:31:25,544
<i>love, and a safe place
to call home.</i>

280
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:28,911
These crime syndicates must go.

281
00:31:28,913 --> 00:31:31,847
The people, the children,
are the future of this country.

282
00:31:33,084 --> 00:31:35,186
<i>When I see them,
I see...</i>

283
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,624
resilience, hope, and strength.

284
00:31:41,959 --> 00:31:43,560
We look forward to that.

285
00:31:43,562 --> 00:31:46,929
<i>The donation you're making
is very sizeable.</i>

286
00:31:46,931 --> 00:31:50,368
<i>It is not a donation. It is
an investment in humanity.</i>

287
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,935
The money allows them

288
00:31:52,937 --> 00:31:53,837
to have options,

289
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:56,205
so that they can get
on the right side of the law.

290
00:31:56,207 --> 00:31:58,742
So that crime syndicates
don't have a grip

291
00:31:58,744 --> 00:32:00,211
on these people through fear.

292
00:32:04,148 --> 00:32:06,516
All right,
she's leaving the hotel.

293
00:32:06,518 --> 00:32:07,518
Ten-four.

294
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:09,486
Moving forward.

295
00:32:09,488 --> 00:32:11,387
What kind of security
are we talking?

296
00:32:11,389 --> 00:32:12,287
Rent-a-cops.

297
00:32:12,289 --> 00:32:14,189
They'll scatter as soon
as we turn up the heat.

298
00:32:14,191 --> 00:32:15,792
We are in business.

299
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:19,964
Let's do it.

300
00:32:25,637 --> 00:32:26,569
Thank you, Xiao Xian.

301
00:32:26,571 --> 00:32:29,206
It has been an honor
to speak with you today.

302
00:32:32,977 --> 00:32:34,177
Thank you so much.

303
00:32:56,133 --> 00:32:58,269
Go! Go! Move! Move!

304
00:33:06,478 --> 00:33:08,010
Hide behind me.

305
00:33:31,135 --> 00:33:32,695
Don't mind me.

306
00:33:40,579 --> 00:33:42,144
Run to the police station.

307
00:33:42,146 --> 00:33:43,212
They'll get you to the embassy.

308
00:33:43,214 --> 00:33:44,714
What about you?

309
00:33:44,716 --> 00:33:46,450
Don't mind me. Three, two, one.

310
00:33:57,496 --> 00:33:58,828
Joey, get in the van.

311
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,229
<i>Devereaux,
move to market.</i>

312
00:34:00,231 --> 00:34:01,698
<i>Dom, you go south.</i>

313
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,332
<i>Steiner, you're with me, now!</i>

314
00:34:10,542 --> 00:34:12,374
Can you please help me?
Please! Please!

315
00:34:12,376 --> 00:34:13,543
Police station! Please!

316
00:34:13,545 --> 00:34:15,143
- Take me to the police station!
- Okay.

317
00:34:15,145 --> 00:34:16,245
Right away!

318
00:34:24,088 --> 00:34:25,020
Stop!

319
00:34:25,022 --> 00:34:27,062
- What are you doing?
- Stop!

320
00:34:33,264 --> 00:34:36,133
...son of a bitch!

321
00:34:45,544 --> 00:34:47,411
Come on! Get in!
Let's go!

322
00:34:50,347 --> 00:34:52,549
Dominique's dead.
He was out of control.

323
00:34:52,551 --> 00:34:54,984
She's gone.
Fucked off in a tuk-tuk.

324
00:34:54,986 --> 00:34:58,021
The intel was wrong.
You almost got us killed.

325
00:34:58,023 --> 00:34:59,454
Deal with it, Devereaux.

326
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:01,156
We get paid
to almost get killed.

327
00:35:01,158 --> 00:35:02,859
Key word. "Almost."

328
00:35:02,861 --> 00:35:03,826
Quit your moanin'.

329
00:35:03,828 --> 00:35:05,060
There's another loose end

330
00:35:05,062 --> 00:35:05,962
we need to deal with.

331
00:35:05,964 --> 00:35:07,931
Who's more important
than killing the girl?

332
00:35:07,933 --> 00:35:11,233
Your two zombie trackers
back from the dead, that's who.

333
00:35:11,235 --> 00:35:12,802
They can ID
every single one of us.

334
00:35:12,804 --> 00:35:14,169
They need to be silenced.

335
00:35:14,171 --> 00:35:15,772
You wanna hit
the police station?

336
00:35:15,774 --> 00:35:17,239
Yes, a police station,

337
00:35:17,241 --> 00:35:19,207
not a castle
with a fuckin' moat.

338
00:35:19,209 --> 00:35:21,109
Those cops
are on cruise control.

339
00:35:21,111 --> 00:35:22,411
They won't be expecting us.

340
00:35:22,413 --> 00:35:24,348
I'm surprised
if they're even awake.

341
00:35:33,592 --> 00:35:36,158
Please! Help me! Please!

342
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,697
Please! Help me! Please!

343
00:35:39,831 --> 00:35:41,296
They've been trying to kill me.

344
00:35:41,298 --> 00:35:42,397
I...

345
00:35:42,399 --> 00:35:44,132
I was just in a shootout.

346
00:35:44,134 --> 00:35:45,300
Do you understand?

347
00:35:45,302 --> 00:35:46,435
Do you...

348
00:35:46,437 --> 00:35:49,038
Do you speak English? Chinese?

349
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,974
Look at this! That's me!

350
00:35:50,976 --> 00:35:52,642
See? That's me.

351
00:35:52,644 --> 00:35:54,544
- Yes. That's me.
- She's on TV.

352
00:35:54,546 --> 00:35:57,112
Come in! Here.

353
00:35:57,114 --> 00:35:59,114
Sit down!

354
00:35:59,116 --> 00:36:00,485
Take it easy, officer.

355
00:36:08,026 --> 00:36:09,291
You are involved

356
00:36:09,293 --> 00:36:11,295
in illegal fighting
and gambling.

357
00:36:12,363 --> 00:36:16,198
Are you asking me or telling me?

358
00:36:20,605 --> 00:36:22,505
Don't lock it up yet.

359
00:36:22,507 --> 00:36:23,507
Move.

360
00:36:27,846 --> 00:36:28,846
Chinese?

361
00:36:35,352 --> 00:36:36,753
I would say we have five

362
00:36:36,755 --> 00:36:37,654
to ten minutes max.

363
00:36:37,656 --> 00:36:39,856
Go in and out quick,
shock and awe, baby.

364
00:36:39,858 --> 00:36:42,257
Devereaux, you're on the wheel.
Joey, you're with us.

365
00:36:42,259 --> 00:36:43,360
Let's go.

366
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Let's go.

367
00:37:01,613 --> 00:37:04,312
Hey, you're the one on TV?

368
00:37:04,314 --> 00:37:05,915
You're Chinese? Great!

369
00:37:05,917 --> 00:37:08,084
Ask her
what happened at the hotel.

370
00:37:08,086 --> 00:37:10,855
Tell him
someone is trying to kill me.

371
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:20,763
You think you're better than us?

372
00:37:20,765 --> 00:37:24,435
Because you are
an ex-soldier?

373
00:37:27,172 --> 00:37:29,739
You're nothing
but a pussy to me.

374
00:37:29,741 --> 00:37:30,807
How about this?

375
00:37:30,809 --> 00:37:32,909
If you don't talk,
you go to prison!

376
00:37:35,714 --> 00:37:38,246
Stay low
and away from the windows!

377
00:37:38,248 --> 00:37:39,314
Let's move.

378
00:37:39,316 --> 00:37:40,750
See what's happening.

379
00:37:47,926 --> 00:37:48,825
Go, quickly!

380
00:37:48,827 --> 00:37:50,595
We have to bring chief
out of here.

381
00:37:51,963 --> 00:37:52,829
Guard him!

382
00:37:52,831 --> 00:37:54,391
- Don't let him go anywhere!
- Yes, sir!

383
00:38:06,911 --> 00:38:08,513
They're coming!

384
00:38:09,379 --> 00:38:11,581
Can you get me out of here?

385
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:13,017
I don't know how.

386
00:38:36,306 --> 00:38:39,075
Officer, please let me go!

387
00:38:40,512 --> 00:38:42,232
Let's sort this out, officer.

388
00:38:50,255 --> 00:38:51,319
Stop!

389
00:38:57,796 --> 00:38:58,796
Long-Fei!

390
00:38:59,898 --> 00:39:00,898
Stay here!

391
00:39:04,736 --> 00:39:05,736
Shit.

392
00:39:07,672 --> 00:39:09,437
We need to find another way out.

393
00:39:11,441 --> 00:39:12,975
Get up! On your feet!

394
00:39:14,612 --> 00:39:15,892
Where do they keep
the prisoners?

395
00:39:16,948 --> 00:39:18,281
Where are the prisoners?

396
00:39:18,283 --> 00:39:19,381
They aren't here!

397
00:39:19,383 --> 00:39:21,217
All prisoners
are locked up downstairs.

398
00:39:21,219 --> 00:39:23,252
Prisoners
are downstairs in holding.

399
00:39:23,254 --> 00:39:24,921
Mook!
Break out the door!

400
00:39:27,357 --> 00:39:29,091
<i>Check
every single hallway.</i>

401
00:39:29,093 --> 00:39:30,960
<i>Mook, I need you upstairs
with me.</i>

402
00:39:30,962 --> 00:39:32,096
I'm on my way, Collins.

403
00:39:41,405 --> 00:39:43,673
Just who I was looking for.

404
00:39:43,675 --> 00:39:45,508
The girl had nothing to do
with this.

405
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:47,009
She's everything to do
with this.

406
00:39:47,011 --> 00:39:48,010
What?

407
00:39:48,012 --> 00:39:49,478
What are you talking about?

408
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,781
This is my lucky day.

409
00:39:55,253 --> 00:39:56,487
Get out of here!

410
00:40:43,735 --> 00:40:45,167
Huh?

411
00:41:04,322 --> 00:41:05,990
You. You set this up.

412
00:41:07,625 --> 00:41:09,027
I did it to flush them out.

413
00:41:10,427 --> 00:41:11,494
You should go.

414
00:41:11,496 --> 00:41:12,828
Leave with your friend.

415
00:41:16,234 --> 00:41:17,234
Go.

416
00:41:34,585 --> 00:41:35,618
Move! Quickly!

417
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:25,570
Don't do it.

418
00:42:48,292 --> 00:42:49,527
Well, well, well.

419
00:42:51,195 --> 00:42:53,062
What a nice surprise.

420
00:42:53,064 --> 00:42:54,064
Joey!

421
00:43:07,645 --> 00:43:09,078
Go!

422
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,279
Take the girl!

423
00:43:10,281 --> 00:43:11,281
Get out of here!

424
00:43:12,283 --> 00:43:13,283
Go!

425
00:43:14,919 --> 00:43:16,479
Gotta go now! Go!

426
00:43:16,988 --> 00:43:18,054
Come on!

427
00:43:18,056 --> 00:43:19,121
Come on.

428
00:43:24,062 --> 00:43:25,127
Go!

429
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,781
Shit.

430
00:44:30,027 --> 00:44:32,194
Everybody fall back.

431
00:44:32,196 --> 00:44:34,763
Big man, meet me
at the south side alley way.

432
00:44:34,765 --> 00:44:36,067
Huh?

433
00:44:42,474 --> 00:44:43,540
Get in!

434
00:44:43,542 --> 00:44:44,707
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

435
00:44:51,015 --> 00:44:53,349
- Move it!
- All right!

436
00:44:53,351 --> 00:44:54,850
Oh! Please!

437
00:44:54,852 --> 00:44:57,319
Keep moving. Keep moving.
Go! Keep moving.

438
00:44:57,321 --> 00:44:59,690
I said the south side.
Where are ya?

439
00:45:04,695 --> 00:45:06,364
Go!

440
00:45:10,768 --> 00:45:11,934
Mook! Where's Mook?

441
00:45:11,936 --> 00:45:14,303
- She's fuckin' dead, all right?
- Shit.

442
00:45:14,305 --> 00:45:15,871
- And Steiner?
- Steiner, too.

443
00:45:15,873 --> 00:45:17,673
This is turning
into a real shit show.

444
00:45:17,675 --> 00:45:19,308
This is
an expensive fuckin' exercise.

445
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:21,977
Who are these fuckin'
bush babies you hired anyway?

446
00:45:21,979 --> 00:45:24,413
Just local trackers
from one of the villages.

447
00:45:24,415 --> 00:45:26,483
From like a village
of fuckin' ninja warrior land?

448
00:45:26,485 --> 00:45:27,517
Jesus Christ!

449
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:29,754
They have to be down
one of these streets.

450
00:45:32,456 --> 00:45:34,336
There they are!

451
00:45:37,428 --> 00:45:38,428
Guys.

452
00:45:40,064 --> 00:45:41,997
Moving! Moving! Move!

453
00:45:41,999 --> 00:45:43,234
- Huh?
- Wait, what?

454
00:45:56,747 --> 00:45:57,915
Come on!

455
00:45:59,283 --> 00:46:00,550
There they fucking are!

456
00:46:00,552 --> 00:46:01,784
In here! Move!

457
00:46:01,786 --> 00:46:03,020
Get out of the way!

458
00:46:08,326 --> 00:46:09,391
Fuckin' move!

459
00:46:09,393 --> 00:46:10,393
Down here!

460
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,534
Whoa!

461
00:46:17,536 --> 00:46:19,569
Fuckin' hell! Jesus!

462
00:46:22,106 --> 00:46:23,640
Whoa!

463
00:46:23,642 --> 00:46:25,376
Shut the fuck up! Fuck off!

464
00:46:29,648 --> 00:46:30,781
They're gone!

465
00:46:32,383 --> 00:46:34,984
Fuck!

466
00:46:34,986 --> 00:46:37,086
Now you get the van,
get to Devereaux.

467
00:46:37,088 --> 00:46:37,987
No way.

468
00:46:37,989 --> 00:46:39,054
You meet me
at the marketplace there.

469
00:46:39,056 --> 00:46:40,456
No, you do as your fuckin' told
and get in the van.

470
00:46:40,458 --> 00:46:42,091
Who do you think
you're talking to, eh?

471
00:46:42,093 --> 00:46:44,159
You keep telling me what to do,
and you're pissing me off.

472
00:46:44,161 --> 00:46:46,362
We're running around the streets
with fuckin' machine guns.

473
00:46:46,364 --> 00:46:47,263
Look at the eyes on us!

474
00:46:47,265 --> 00:46:49,064
How long is it gonna be
before the police turn up?

475
00:46:49,066 --> 00:46:50,366
You take that,
you get to the van,

476
00:46:50,368 --> 00:46:51,936
and you do
as you're fucking told!

477
00:47:01,245 --> 00:47:02,479
Sir.

478
00:47:02,481 --> 00:47:06,248
Oh. Lee,
you've arrived just in time.

479
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:09,184
These are signed.

480
00:47:09,186 --> 00:47:10,286
You can send them out.

481
00:47:10,288 --> 00:47:15,226
Of course, but I have
something urgent to report.

482
00:47:15,761 --> 00:47:16,660
What?

483
00:47:16,662 --> 00:47:21,997
There has been an attack
on the Nagavara Hotel.

484
00:47:21,999 --> 00:47:24,400
Are Liang and Xiao Xian safe?

485
00:47:24,402 --> 00:47:26,835
Liang is injured.
She's in the hospital.

486
00:47:26,837 --> 00:47:29,539
Xiao Xian is missing.

487
00:47:29,541 --> 00:47:30,774
Missing?

488
00:47:30,776 --> 00:47:32,941
Liang believes Xiao Xian
must have run

489
00:47:32,943 --> 00:47:34,310
to the Chinese Embassy.

490
00:47:34,312 --> 00:47:38,849
But so far,
we haven't heard from her.

491
00:47:40,251 --> 00:47:44,021
Get me
the Maha Jaya Chief of Police.

492
00:47:55,966 --> 00:47:57,032
Yeah?

493
00:47:57,034 --> 00:47:58,802
You messed up
the contract, Collins.

494
00:47:58,804 --> 00:48:01,136
Do I need to engage someone else
to take care of this?

495
00:48:01,138 --> 00:48:03,238
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, Su Feng.

496
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:04,641
Everything's under control,
all right?

497
00:48:04,643 --> 00:48:06,476
<i>If this is under control,</i>

498
00:48:06,478 --> 00:48:08,545
I'd hate to see
what out of control looks like.

499
00:48:08,547 --> 00:48:10,480
It'll look like me decimating
any other team

500
00:48:10,482 --> 00:48:11,447
that gets in my way,

501
00:48:11,449 --> 00:48:14,183
so back off
and let us do our job.

502
00:48:14,185 --> 00:48:15,752
You should come and see me.

503
00:48:15,754 --> 00:48:16,952
<i>Not yet.</i>

504
00:48:16,954 --> 00:48:18,954
I'll have this spotless
before the sun comes up.

505
00:48:18,956 --> 00:48:20,322
I'll come and see you then.

506
00:48:24,095 --> 00:48:25,595
Freeze!

507
00:48:25,597 --> 00:48:26,597
Put your hands up!

508
00:48:28,265 --> 00:48:30,099
I haven't got time for this.

509
00:48:30,101 --> 00:48:32,937
Turn back!
Put your hands on your head!

510
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,540
You're makin'
a big mistake, pal.

511
00:48:45,916 --> 00:48:47,418
We're after the same people.

512
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:49,719
We should talk.

513
00:48:49,721 --> 00:48:51,441
I'm a little busy
right now, mate.

514
00:48:53,658 --> 00:48:54,658
Drop the gun.

515
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:00,430
Stand up.

516
00:49:04,301 --> 00:49:05,934
What do you want?

517
00:49:05,936 --> 00:49:07,338
Let's not play games.

518
00:49:08,774 --> 00:49:10,139
I could work with you.

519
00:49:10,141 --> 00:49:12,141
I can help you take down
the dude that you're after.

520
00:49:12,143 --> 00:49:13,843
I'm not looking
for an apprentice right now.

521
00:49:13,845 --> 00:49:15,712
Thank you very much.

522
00:49:15,714 --> 00:49:18,515
Who exactly are they,
and what do you want with them?

523
00:49:18,517 --> 00:49:21,851
They're mercenaries,
like me.

524
00:49:21,853 --> 00:49:24,420
I've been after them for years.

525
00:49:24,422 --> 00:49:27,724
Looking at your situation,
I'd say you need some help.

526
00:49:27,726 --> 00:49:30,259
And how exactly do you suppose
you're gonna help me?

527
00:49:30,261 --> 00:49:32,227
I know my way around the city.

528
00:49:32,229 --> 00:49:34,633
And I know the same people
they do and how they work.

529
00:49:37,536 --> 00:49:39,401
Long-Fei and Payu,

530
00:49:39,403 --> 00:49:41,937
they also have the girl
you're after.

531
00:49:41,939 --> 00:49:45,109
Look, if we work together,
we can both get what we want.

532
00:49:48,379 --> 00:49:50,114
You can certainly
handle yourself.

533
00:49:51,483 --> 00:49:54,051
Maybe I could use a little bit
of local assistance.

534
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:57,487
We better get out of here

535
00:49:57,489 --> 00:49:59,156
before his mates turn up
don't you?

536
00:50:01,091 --> 00:50:02,226
Yeah.

537
00:50:14,405 --> 00:50:15,638
What were you doing

538
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,139
at the police station?

539
00:50:17,141 --> 00:50:19,074
We were
in an underground fight.

540
00:50:19,076 --> 00:50:21,278
There may have been
some gambling involved.

541
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:26,950
Did you guys win?

542
00:50:26,952 --> 00:50:29,353
Of course. We are professionals.

543
00:50:32,524 --> 00:50:33,525
And he is?

544
00:50:35,226 --> 00:50:36,460
That's Payu.

545
00:50:38,597 --> 00:50:42,164
Payu, thank you for saving me.

546
00:50:42,166 --> 00:50:43,267
Thank you.

547
00:50:44,636 --> 00:50:46,368
Anytime.

548
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:48,370
Can I trust you guys?

549
00:50:48,372 --> 00:50:52,009
The police aren't an option.
Do you have a choice?

550
00:50:55,246 --> 00:50:56,548
I grew up near here.

551
00:51:23,374 --> 00:51:24,476
Go, go, go.

552
00:51:27,144 --> 00:51:28,545
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

553
00:51:28,547 --> 00:51:29,812
Get down.

554
00:51:29,814 --> 00:51:30,880
What are you doing?

555
00:51:30,882 --> 00:51:33,248
You drive. I'll navigate.

556
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:35,217
You realize
this is a cop car, right?

557
00:51:35,219 --> 00:51:36,721
We're just going to borrow it.

558
00:51:39,056 --> 00:51:40,122
You should drive.

559
00:51:40,124 --> 00:51:41,558
This is a girl's car.

560
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:44,494
Since when do cars have genders?
This is not the time to joke.

561
00:51:44,496 --> 00:51:46,395
I'm not joking. I can't drive.

562
00:51:46,397 --> 00:51:48,531
What do you mean
you can't drive?

563
00:51:48,533 --> 00:51:50,967
I mean,
I don't know how to drive.

564
00:51:50,969 --> 00:51:52,869
You're a professional?
How come you can't drive?

565
00:51:52,871 --> 00:51:55,103
I'm a professional,
just not a professional driver.

566
00:51:55,105 --> 00:51:56,171
Shit.

567
00:51:56,173 --> 00:51:57,274
Here.

568
00:52:13,892 --> 00:52:15,625
Hey, my car!

569
00:52:15,627 --> 00:52:16,526
Hey, stop!

570
00:52:16,528 --> 00:52:18,193
Where are you going?

571
00:52:18,195 --> 00:52:19,294
Look,

572
00:52:19,296 --> 00:52:20,630
we'll get the job done,
all right?

573
00:52:20,632 --> 00:52:21,664
Trust me.

574
00:52:21,666 --> 00:52:23,398
It'll be business
as usual before...

575
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:24,636
Hello?

576
00:52:37,181 --> 00:52:39,281
So, what's up?

577
00:52:39,283 --> 00:52:41,918
Ah, that Su Feng meeting
didn't go well.

578
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,386
She's even more pissed off
than she normally is.

579
00:52:44,388 --> 00:52:45,988
You said
you could handle it.

580
00:52:46,725 --> 00:52:48,091
Yeah.

581
00:52:48,093 --> 00:52:49,259
So, what does that mean?

582
00:52:51,663 --> 00:52:53,896
Well, it's pretty simple,
really.

583
00:52:53,898 --> 00:52:56,231
We've got 48 hours
to execute those little pricks

584
00:52:56,233 --> 00:52:57,334
and if we don't,

585
00:52:58,737 --> 00:53:00,237
contract reverts to us.

586
00:53:04,208 --> 00:53:05,844
Nah, not alcohol.

587
00:53:09,981 --> 00:53:11,413
Jesus.

588
00:53:11,415 --> 00:53:15,152
Remind me and the lads
why we need you again.

589
00:53:16,353 --> 00:53:17,856
All of you are ex-military.

590
00:53:18,923 --> 00:53:20,957
Maybe special forces?

591
00:53:20,959 --> 00:53:22,659
Martial arts training.

592
00:53:22,661 --> 00:53:25,497
But maybe a bit out of shape.

593
00:53:27,398 --> 00:53:29,132
You don't know us well enough
to be making

594
00:53:29,134 --> 00:53:30,494
that kind of statement now,
do you?

595
00:53:33,705 --> 00:53:34,637
You were saying?

596
00:53:34,639 --> 00:53:36,639
All right, calm down.

597
00:53:36,641 --> 00:53:37,641
Devereaux.

598
00:53:39,243 --> 00:53:40,510
He's useful.

599
00:53:40,512 --> 00:53:42,881
Crew is light anyways,
so I say we keep him.

600
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:52,322
Like I said, if you're going
after Long-Fei and Payu,

601
00:53:53,223 --> 00:53:54,458
you need my help.

602
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:59,662
This little motherfucker
just doesn't quit, does he?

603
00:53:59,664 --> 00:54:02,598
Look, we've got contacts
coming out of our asses, mate.

604
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:04,801
Pretty soon, someone somewhere
is gonna give her up.

605
00:54:04,803 --> 00:54:07,872
She is well-connected in China
and has nowhere to go.

606
00:54:09,741 --> 00:54:11,442
She will head
to the Chinese Embassy.

607
00:54:23,955 --> 00:54:25,387
I thought Maha Jaya

608
00:54:25,389 --> 00:54:26,758
fixed their traffic problem.

609
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:30,727
Something is wrong.

610
00:54:30,729 --> 00:54:33,029
This can't be
a coincidence.

611
00:54:33,031 --> 00:54:34,331
It has to be them.

612
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,709
Can I borrow your phone?

613
00:54:45,176 --> 00:54:46,276
Okay.

614
00:54:52,617 --> 00:54:54,584
Xiao Xian, where are you?

615
00:54:54,586 --> 00:54:56,619
Madame Liang,
I hope you're better now.

616
00:54:56,621 --> 00:54:59,889
We can see the embassy,

617
00:54:59,891 --> 00:55:02,759
but we're stuck
behind the roadblock.

618
00:55:02,761 --> 00:55:06,428
<i>There was a bomb threat
at the embassy.</i>

619
00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:08,666
<i>We think it was them.</i>

620
00:55:17,976 --> 00:55:19,043
It's all blocked.

621
00:55:19,944 --> 00:55:21,343
Who are you with?

622
00:55:21,345 --> 00:55:23,782
Some new friends.
They're helping me out.

623
00:55:25,382 --> 00:55:26,649
I'm moving now.

624
00:55:28,987 --> 00:55:29,987
Go, go, go!

625
00:55:31,156 --> 00:55:32,490
Go. Drive.

626
00:55:34,259 --> 00:55:35,758
Drive!

627
00:55:37,228 --> 00:55:38,696
Faster. Go, go!

628
00:55:47,138 --> 00:55:48,905
Come on!

629
00:55:48,907 --> 00:55:50,473
Get back to the van
and cut 'em off.

630
00:55:50,475 --> 00:55:51,609
Yeah, yeah.

631
00:56:06,791 --> 00:56:07,791
Hey!

632
00:56:36,087 --> 00:56:37,553
Are you okay?

633
00:56:37,555 --> 00:56:38,888
Who is he?

634
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:40,390
Not a friend.

635
00:56:42,392 --> 00:56:44,095
We have to go. Now!

636
00:56:47,465 --> 00:56:49,131
Let me see.

637
00:56:49,133 --> 00:56:50,133
Huh?

638
00:56:53,571 --> 00:56:55,738
To the center, do you copy?

639
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:56,841
No one's here.

640
00:57:01,946 --> 00:57:03,112
Jaka.

641
00:57:03,114 --> 00:57:05,248
They're in the other market.

642
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:07,250
Between Kwang and Kent.

643
00:57:07,252 --> 00:57:08,553
- Jaka.
- What are you doing?

644
00:57:10,021 --> 00:57:11,787
You used us a bait.

645
00:57:11,789 --> 00:57:13,356
Be patient, my friend.

646
00:57:13,358 --> 00:57:16,192
My fight is with Collins,
not you.

647
00:57:16,194 --> 00:57:17,427
Just keep moving.

648
00:57:20,298 --> 00:57:21,532
It's your funeral, man.

649
00:57:29,908 --> 00:57:30,908
This way!

650
00:57:34,846 --> 00:57:36,848
They were here.
We just lost them.

651
00:57:38,583 --> 00:57:40,149
And here you are.

652
00:57:40,151 --> 00:57:42,685
I followed them from the crash.
Lost them in the market.

653
00:57:42,687 --> 00:57:44,720
You're always in the right place
at the right time, huh?

654
00:57:44,722 --> 00:57:45,855
That's why you need me.

655
00:57:45,857 --> 00:57:47,623
Collins, over here.

656
00:57:47,625 --> 00:57:49,592
Good job.

657
00:57:49,594 --> 00:57:52,929
You know my gut
has kept me alive,

658
00:57:52,931 --> 00:57:54,931
sort of like a sixth sense.

659
00:57:54,933 --> 00:57:56,701
And you know
what my gut is telling me?

660
00:57:57,434 --> 00:57:59,101
You're up to something.

661
00:57:59,103 --> 00:58:02,705
If you have a point to make,
make it.

662
00:58:02,707 --> 00:58:04,642
Oh, I will, when the time comes.

663
00:58:13,618 --> 00:58:14,986
Wait. Stop.

664
00:58:38,609 --> 00:58:40,912
You go that way.
I'll sweep 'em towards ya.

665
00:58:49,854 --> 00:58:51,420
Hold on, mate.

666
00:58:51,422 --> 00:58:52,588
Sorry, not open.

667
00:58:52,590 --> 00:58:53,791
Health department.

668
00:58:57,195 --> 00:58:58,763
I'm the vice terminator.

669
00:59:52,617 --> 00:59:54,285
Looks like
you passed the inspection.

670
01:00:07,899 --> 01:00:10,066
The Maha Jaya Police Department

671
01:00:10,068 --> 01:00:11,834
is overwhelmed.

672
01:00:11,836 --> 01:00:16,405
They can't
guarantee Xiao Xian's safety.

673
01:00:16,407 --> 01:00:21,777
The search will have to wait

674
01:00:21,779 --> 01:00:25,116
until additional support
arrives tomorrow.

675
01:00:57,615 --> 01:00:58,816
Can I see it?

676
01:01:01,752 --> 01:01:03,986
Yeah.

677
01:01:03,988 --> 01:01:06,068
Looks like
we're stuck here for the night.

678
01:01:07,959 --> 01:01:09,493
Great.

679
01:01:09,495 --> 01:01:13,262
Tell me how
you know these people?

680
01:01:13,264 --> 01:01:14,230
We were hired

681
01:01:14,232 --> 01:01:16,098
for a humanitarian
rescue mission, only it wasn't.

682
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:18,636
Instead, they freed Collins
and left us for dead.

683
01:01:21,139 --> 01:01:23,540
And who is the guy
at the market?

684
01:01:23,542 --> 01:01:27,009
He's with the foreigners,
but he's one of us.

685
01:01:27,011 --> 01:01:28,644
It's complicated.

686
01:01:28,646 --> 01:01:29,747
Complicated?

687
01:01:30,582 --> 01:01:33,483
His people were killed

688
01:01:33,485 --> 01:01:35,887
when the camp was destroyed.

689
01:01:36,654 --> 01:01:37,788
So, he's a mole?

690
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:40,191
Sort of.

691
01:01:43,127 --> 01:01:45,427
So the two of you
are responsible for this?

692
01:01:45,429 --> 01:01:47,396
Now, what?

693
01:01:47,398 --> 01:01:51,869
Now, we take cover here
for the night.

694
01:01:53,037 --> 01:01:56,040
Tomorrow, we can try
the embassy again.

695
01:01:56,774 --> 01:01:57,875
Sit.

696
01:02:01,345 --> 01:02:05,783
I guess you can only call in
so many bomb threats.

697
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:10,853
May I take your orders?

698
01:02:10,855 --> 01:02:12,922
Hi all. I'm Payu, your chef.

699
01:02:12,924 --> 01:02:15,592
Today, I proudly present
to you my best dish,

700
01:02:15,594 --> 01:02:18,260
stir-fried swamp cabbage!

701
01:02:20,431 --> 01:02:24,433
It's best served with hot soup,
which we're gonna have...

702
01:02:24,435 --> 01:02:27,371
Oops... River prawn spicy soup!

703
01:02:28,806 --> 01:02:31,807
Payu was a field cook.

704
01:02:31,809 --> 01:02:33,242
A damn good one.

705
01:02:33,244 --> 01:02:35,411
You like spicy? Ooh.

706
01:02:51,862 --> 01:02:53,295
Let's keep lookin'.

707
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:06,942
So was it
your dad's mission or yours?

708
01:03:06,944 --> 01:03:09,481
It was my dad's mission
that I embraced.

709
01:03:10,582 --> 01:03:13,617
Enough about me. What about you?

710
01:03:13,619 --> 01:03:18,120
You two were obviously
professionally trained.

711
01:03:18,122 --> 01:03:19,890
Why did you leave China?

712
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:25,027
When I was young,
my father brought me here.

713
01:03:25,029 --> 01:03:27,296
We've been living here
since then.

714
01:03:27,298 --> 01:03:30,502
There's money
working security here.

715
01:03:31,470 --> 01:03:33,271
One job, two jobs.

716
01:03:34,438 --> 01:03:36,005
I want to make enough money

717
01:03:36,007 --> 01:03:38,541
to bring my father
back to China.

718
01:03:38,543 --> 01:03:40,778
But now, I cannot go home.

719
01:03:42,913 --> 01:03:47,484
Since you saved me,
maybe I can help you?

720
01:03:47,486 --> 01:03:51,956
I know a lot of people.
I'll find a way.

721
01:03:55,259 --> 01:03:59,928
Ladies
and gentlemen, dinner is served.

722
01:03:59,930 --> 01:04:01,032
Thank you.

723
01:04:02,433 --> 01:04:04,035
For me.

724
01:04:04,835 --> 01:04:06,070
Enjoy.

725
01:04:07,405 --> 01:04:10,039
This is actually
really delicious.

726
01:04:10,041 --> 01:04:13,242
You pick up a lot,
moving from place to place.

727
01:04:13,244 --> 01:04:14,611
Delicious.

728
01:04:14,613 --> 01:04:16,780
It's good.

729
01:04:16,782 --> 01:04:18,213
If it's good, then eat more.

730
01:04:18,215 --> 01:04:20,115
That's my beer.
The other one's yours.

731
01:04:20,117 --> 01:04:21,950
Of course, you do. All right.

732
01:04:21,952 --> 01:04:23,085
Toast?

733
01:04:23,087 --> 01:04:24,186
- Cheers.
- Cheers?

734
01:04:24,188 --> 01:04:25,921
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah, cheers.

735
01:04:38,169 --> 01:04:39,902
We're gonna have
every syndicate hit squad

736
01:04:39,904 --> 01:04:41,571
in bloody Indochina on our cases

737
01:04:41,573 --> 01:04:44,340
if we don't snare these
three little imps sometime soon.

738
01:04:44,342 --> 01:04:46,375
I am painfully aware of that.

739
01:04:46,377 --> 01:04:47,943
It's gonna get
a lot more painful

740
01:04:47,945 --> 01:04:50,881
if we don't solve
this problem... quickly.

741
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:04,395
<i>Dummy. I'm always here.</i>

742
01:05:06,430 --> 01:05:10,366
I should
never have brought you.

743
01:05:10,368 --> 01:05:11,969
<i>I just wanted
you with me.</i>

744
01:05:17,676 --> 01:05:19,241
<i>I promise that
when everything is over</i>

745
01:05:19,243 --> 01:05:20,978
<i>and they are dead,</i>

746
01:05:22,481 --> 01:05:25,116
<i>I will live my life
and make you proud.</i>

747
01:05:26,518 --> 01:05:28,319
<i>I will convince them
to trust me.</i>

748
01:05:31,922 --> 01:05:33,457
I will kill them
with my bare hands.

749
01:05:34,659 --> 01:05:36,427
I will kill them
with my bare hands.

750
01:05:41,932 --> 01:05:43,535
<i>On my...</i>

751
01:05:45,837 --> 01:05:47,338
<i>terms...</i>

752
01:05:51,175 --> 01:05:52,943
at the right time.

753
01:06:03,387 --> 01:06:06,123
I will face them
one by one.

754
01:06:21,372 --> 01:06:22,605
Going to the Embassy

755
01:06:22,607 --> 01:06:23,540
is a mistake.

756
01:06:23,542 --> 01:06:26,743
The cartel will do anything
to stop my donation.

757
01:06:26,745 --> 01:06:29,079
That's all that matters to me.

758
01:06:30,682 --> 01:06:32,442
I'm the one they're looking for.

759
01:06:33,217 --> 01:06:34,818
So give me up.

760
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:36,018
I don't think so.

761
01:06:36,020 --> 01:06:37,252
Use me as bait.

762
01:06:37,254 --> 01:06:38,623
It's too dangerous.

763
01:06:40,725 --> 01:06:43,192
Well, we need to come up
with some sort of plan.

764
01:06:43,194 --> 01:06:45,329
You know this is the only way
it could work.

765
01:06:47,732 --> 01:06:48,732
She's right.

766
01:06:50,669 --> 01:06:52,869
I have an idea.

767
01:06:52,871 --> 01:06:54,031
Ah, cheers, mate.

768
01:06:55,574 --> 01:07:00,075
Bullshit. Bullshit.
Donnie and Sam, okay, cool.

769
01:07:02,179 --> 01:07:05,180
Ha-ha.
If it isn't the man of the hour.

770
01:07:05,182 --> 01:07:07,015
Let me speak to Collins.

771
01:07:07,017 --> 01:07:08,116
Well, I'm pretty sure

772
01:07:08,118 --> 01:07:09,752
he'd like to speak
with you, too.

773
01:07:09,754 --> 01:07:12,421
Hey, Collins, this is precious.

774
01:07:12,423 --> 01:07:15,057
You're gonna wanna see this.

775
01:07:15,059 --> 01:07:17,392
Well, hello, hello, hello, mate.
How's it goin'?

776
01:07:17,394 --> 01:07:20,830
How's your feet? They hurtin'?
Yeah, I fuckin' hope so.

777
01:07:20,832 --> 01:07:23,633
<i>I have something you want.
Let's talk.</i>

778
01:07:23,635 --> 01:07:25,602
We're talkin' now, champ.

779
01:07:25,604 --> 01:07:28,005
<i>We have Xian.
You want her?</i>

780
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:33,776
Oh, well, fuck me,
I was not expecting that.

781
01:07:33,778 --> 01:07:35,010
- It's bullshit, bro.
- Wait, wait.

782
01:07:35,012 --> 01:07:36,111
Let's see what he's gotta say.

783
01:07:36,113 --> 01:07:37,412
What you got in mind,
my little friend?

784
01:07:37,414 --> 01:07:39,782
Dawn,
at the old Polo club.

785
01:07:39,784 --> 01:07:44,421
<i>You get what you want, I get
$100,000 and our freedom.</i>

786
01:07:46,056 --> 01:07:47,592
A hundred thousand dollars, eh?

787
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:49,559
Yeah, all right.

788
01:07:49,561 --> 01:07:50,894
Got yourself a deal.

789
01:07:50,896 --> 01:07:53,328
But do me favor, don't be late.

790
01:07:53,330 --> 01:07:55,199
I've got a deadline to meet.

791
01:07:57,769 --> 01:08:00,235
Now you know he's trying
to set us up, right?

792
01:08:00,237 --> 01:08:02,037
Don't tell me you trust
that little bastard.

793
01:08:02,039 --> 01:08:04,373
No, I don't trust him.

794
01:08:04,375 --> 01:08:05,742
But I do trust
that they'll be there

795
01:08:05,744 --> 01:08:07,744
whether they're settin' us up
or not.

796
01:08:07,746 --> 01:08:10,613
So I say we use
all the cash we got left.

797
01:08:10,615 --> 01:08:13,516
You find me as many shooters
as you can wrangle.

798
01:08:13,518 --> 01:08:14,416
- Shooters?
- Yeah.

799
01:08:14,418 --> 01:08:17,286
Ugly motherfuckers with guns
who get paid to kill people.

800
01:08:17,288 --> 01:08:19,689
- I know what shooters are.
- Well, good.

801
01:08:19,691 --> 01:08:22,124
We get there early.
We don't fuck about.

802
01:08:22,126 --> 01:08:23,826
We set a few little traps.

803
01:08:23,828 --> 01:08:26,663
And instead
of negotiating the trade,

804
01:08:26,665 --> 01:08:28,531
we fuckin' annihilate
these little pricks,

805
01:08:28,533 --> 01:08:29,933
now how's that for trust?

806
01:08:29,935 --> 01:08:31,034
Well, it's about time,

807
01:08:31,036 --> 01:08:33,304
'cause I'm sick of playin'
fuckin' hide-and-seek.

808
01:09:04,469 --> 01:09:06,103
Welcome back, Payu.

809
01:09:07,237 --> 01:09:08,607
Let's talk inside.

810
01:09:17,147 --> 01:09:19,214
<i>Why are you here, Payu?</i>

811
01:09:19,216 --> 01:09:20,417
You callin' in your marker?

812
01:09:22,487 --> 01:09:24,388
What makes you think
I would honor it?

813
01:09:25,322 --> 01:09:26,591
You are many things,

814
01:09:27,525 --> 01:09:28,525
but...

815
01:09:29,961 --> 01:09:31,563
I know you keep you word.

816
01:09:33,665 --> 01:09:36,367
You haven't told your friends
about our past, have you?

817
01:09:39,070 --> 01:09:40,536
How you earned your name.

818
01:09:41,506 --> 01:09:44,272
Payu, the tempest.

819
01:09:44,274 --> 01:09:46,343
One that destroys
all that it touches.

820
01:09:47,512 --> 01:09:49,614
Not everything I did was good.

821
01:09:52,449 --> 01:09:54,216
He worked with me.

822
01:09:54,218 --> 01:09:56,418
Killed 12 men
in one attack.

823
01:09:56,420 --> 01:09:58,521
I can't say
they didn't deserve it.

824
01:09:58,523 --> 01:09:59,822
- Then he left.
- No, no, no.

825
01:09:59,824 --> 01:10:01,423
- Next thing you know,
- Stop.

826
01:10:01,425 --> 01:10:03,826
He's a soldier of fortune
working far and wide.

827
01:10:03,828 --> 01:10:04,828
Enough!

828
01:10:05,897 --> 01:10:07,197
You owe me.

829
01:10:10,035 --> 01:10:11,467
What do you want, Payu?

830
01:10:11,469 --> 01:10:13,203
I need weapons.

831
01:10:22,914 --> 01:10:23,915
Take what you want.

832
01:10:26,785 --> 01:10:27,785
We're square.

833
01:10:44,736 --> 01:10:46,936
Your donation's
not gonna change anything.

834
01:10:46,938 --> 01:10:50,106
You remove one regime
and another takes its place.

835
01:10:50,108 --> 01:10:52,610
You need to stay alive
to make a difference.

836
01:10:54,713 --> 01:10:56,514
Do you have anything
more substantial?

837
01:11:00,051 --> 01:11:01,784
Get in. Okay.

838
01:11:01,786 --> 01:11:02,786
Payu!

839
01:11:03,822 --> 01:11:06,791
Don't forget what I said.
We're even.

840
01:11:36,453 --> 01:11:40,255
So, we're gonna take care
of these little shits

841
01:11:40,257 --> 01:11:41,356
and get back to business.

842
01:11:41,358 --> 01:11:42,759
This is business right now.

843
01:11:42,761 --> 01:11:44,594
Split into pairs.
Get into position.

844
01:11:44,596 --> 01:11:46,898
Cover the main area. All right?

845
01:11:47,766 --> 01:11:48,766
Go!

846
01:11:53,571 --> 01:11:55,006
This ends tonight.

847
01:11:58,810 --> 01:12:02,046
Ah, used one of those before,
haven't you?

848
01:12:03,715 --> 01:12:07,519
You know, you look like somebody
who, uh, knows their guns.

849
01:12:10,221 --> 01:12:11,756
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

850
01:12:13,423 --> 01:12:15,725
Hey, what are you anyway, man?

851
01:12:15,727 --> 01:12:18,094
Cambodian? Vietnamese?

852
01:12:18,096 --> 01:12:19,529
Indonesia.

853
01:12:19,531 --> 01:12:20,832
Indonesian!

854
01:12:22,467 --> 01:12:23,802
Indonesian!

855
01:12:24,434 --> 01:12:25,868
Yeah, yeah, man.

856
01:12:25,870 --> 01:12:27,537
We ran
into some Indonesians.

857
01:12:27,539 --> 01:12:29,437
Up in the north.

858
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:31,543
Yeah, they were being used
as camp security.

859
01:12:32,376 --> 01:12:34,411
Yeah, yeah. They were terrible.

860
01:12:36,581 --> 01:12:38,714
We deep sixed 'em all.

861
01:12:38,716 --> 01:12:40,583
Left 'em
in the sun to bloat

862
01:12:40,585 --> 01:12:42,384
and feed the flies.

863
01:12:42,386 --> 01:12:45,254
That doesn't bother you,
does it?

864
01:12:45,256 --> 01:12:46,624
Wouldn't be anyone
you knew, right?

865
01:12:47,659 --> 01:12:49,492
C'mon, speak up.

866
01:12:49,494 --> 01:12:51,961
We all on the same team. Huh?

867
01:12:51,963 --> 01:12:53,196
Get off my back.

868
01:12:53,198 --> 01:12:54,599
I'll get off your back.

869
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:57,867
I just thought it was something
that you wanted

870
01:12:57,869 --> 01:12:59,103
to get off your little chest.

871
01:13:03,241 --> 01:13:04,140
Your shooters clear

872
01:13:04,142 --> 01:13:06,142
on what we expect
from them, Devereaux?

873
01:13:06,144 --> 01:13:08,978
Yeah, I got eight guns
pointed at me right now.

874
01:13:08,980 --> 01:13:10,014
All right, good.

875
01:13:11,115 --> 01:13:12,483
Let's get this done.

876
01:14:22,287 --> 01:14:24,854
Where's the other mouseketeer?

877
01:14:24,856 --> 01:14:27,455
He's outside,
making sure we weren't followed.

878
01:14:27,457 --> 01:14:29,225
Is he?

879
01:14:29,227 --> 01:14:31,663
Well, that's all right.
We had the same idea, didn't we?

880
01:14:32,797 --> 01:14:35,097
Your team double-crossed us.

881
01:14:35,099 --> 01:14:36,200
Left us for dead.

882
01:14:37,434 --> 01:14:39,268
They did.

883
01:14:39,270 --> 01:14:42,040
But that was then, this is now.

884
01:14:44,208 --> 01:14:46,142
So are we gonna do this or what?

885
01:15:01,793 --> 01:15:03,594
There's your money
in that case...

886
01:15:05,630 --> 01:15:06,864
just like we agreed.

887
01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:23,813
Why don't you come over here,
darlin'?

888
01:15:23,815 --> 01:15:24,914
Don't worry.

889
01:15:24,916 --> 01:15:26,484
Promise I'll make it quick.

890
01:15:27,352 --> 01:15:28,818
Do you remember the first time

891
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:30,519
you felt your soul
slipping away?

892
01:15:30,521 --> 01:15:31,587
My soul?

893
01:15:33,825 --> 01:15:35,760
No, there's no souls here,
sweetheart.

894
01:15:36,728 --> 01:15:37,960
Just a bunch of blokes

895
01:15:37,962 --> 01:15:39,895
doin' our jobs
like everyone else.

896
01:15:42,433 --> 01:15:43,899
Now granted,

897
01:15:43,901 --> 01:15:45,234
wasn't exactly
what I wanted to be doing

898
01:15:45,236 --> 01:15:46,502
when I was all grown up,

899
01:15:46,504 --> 01:15:47,703
but you know what?

900
01:15:47,705 --> 01:15:49,345
Turned out
I was pretty bloody good at it.

901
01:15:50,808 --> 01:15:53,644
There's you money,
just like I agreed.

902
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:58,049
The girl, send her over.

903
01:16:02,286 --> 01:16:04,086
The girl! Now!

904
01:16:24,042 --> 01:16:26,510
Aim the gun, pull the trigger,

905
01:16:26,512 --> 01:16:27,610
until it's empty.

906
01:16:27,612 --> 01:16:28,679
Got it.

907
01:16:36,687 --> 01:16:37,789
Shit.

908
01:17:13,791 --> 01:17:17,128
The Indonesians you killed
were my people.

909
01:17:18,229 --> 01:17:20,164
I buried my wife
because of you.

910
01:17:21,299 --> 01:17:22,600
This is personal.

911
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:34,276
That's the dumbest thing

912
01:17:34,278 --> 01:17:35,947
you're never gonna live
to regret.

913
01:17:36,747 --> 01:17:38,214
Let's see.

914
01:18:10,616 --> 01:18:12,183
Come on, you rat boss!

915
01:19:06,938 --> 01:19:09,338
Oh, I'm gonna enjoy this.

916
01:19:09,340 --> 01:19:11,941
Come on!
Let's see what you got.

917
01:21:05,590 --> 01:21:06,957
Not bad for a little man.

918
01:21:10,194 --> 01:21:11,960
Does it have to be this way?

919
01:21:11,962 --> 01:21:13,395
I'm afraid it does.

920
01:21:13,397 --> 01:21:15,500
We finish this
right fuckin' here!

921
01:21:48,232 --> 01:21:51,035
You'll be seeing
your wife soon. Shh.

922
01:22:27,405 --> 01:22:28,607
Hello?

923
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:31,173
Who is this?

924
01:22:31,175 --> 01:22:32,542
<i>Tian Xiao Xian</i>

925
01:22:32,544 --> 01:22:33,942
<i>is at the abandoned
Polo club.</i>

926
01:22:33,944 --> 01:22:35,512
<i>Send somebody to rescue her.</i>

927
01:22:35,514 --> 01:22:36,746
Hello?

928
01:22:36,748 --> 01:22:38,583
Hello? Hello?

929
01:23:28,399 --> 01:23:30,299
You know,
you're a pretty good fighter.

930
01:23:30,301 --> 01:23:32,000
I'm gonna teach you
a lesson.

931
01:23:32,002 --> 01:23:34,038
Talk, talk, talk.

932
01:23:47,486 --> 01:23:50,755
Now look at you.
You're weak and pathetic.

933
01:24:04,101 --> 01:24:06,936
You sneaky, little bastard!

934
01:24:06,938 --> 01:24:09,238
I should've listened
to Devereaux, shouldn't I?

935
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:11,676
He's dead, as you will be soon.

936
01:24:13,712 --> 01:24:15,747
Well, I reckon
I fancy these odds anyway.

937
01:24:41,205 --> 01:24:43,038
Come on there, village boy.

938
01:25:25,016 --> 01:25:26,818
Jaka? Jaka!

939
01:25:48,305 --> 01:25:49,404
You pissed off

940
01:25:49,406 --> 01:25:51,141
some really
important people, girl.

941
01:25:52,343 --> 01:25:55,245
For that, you have my respect.

942
01:25:59,818 --> 01:26:00,818
Uh-uh.

943
01:26:02,621 --> 01:26:03,621
Drop it.

944
01:26:10,095 --> 01:26:11,195
Slide it over.

945
01:26:12,229 --> 01:26:13,430
Slide it over!

946
01:26:23,842 --> 01:26:25,374
It's about time
I cash my paycheck,

947
01:26:25,376 --> 01:26:26,809
don't you think?

948
01:26:33,018 --> 01:26:35,652
Jesus Christ!

949
01:26:35,654 --> 01:26:39,287
Why the fuck is it so hard
to kill one little Chinese girl?

950
01:26:42,961 --> 01:26:45,396
You left me for dead... twice.

951
01:26:46,965 --> 01:26:49,333
It will not happen again.

952
01:27:08,820 --> 01:27:11,386
You come and have a go,
if you think you're hard enough.

953
01:28:22,694 --> 01:28:25,327
Is that all you got? Huh?

954
01:28:25,329 --> 01:28:27,063
You shoulda stayed in the pits!

955
01:28:27,065 --> 01:28:29,232
Less talk, just die.

956
01:28:48,418 --> 01:28:51,055
Talk, talk, talk.

957
01:28:51,990 --> 01:28:53,457
No more talk.

958
01:29:27,859 --> 01:29:29,699
That's enough.

959
01:29:30,195 --> 01:29:31,195
He's dead.

960
01:29:32,864 --> 01:29:33,864
Are you sure?

961
01:29:39,537 --> 01:29:40,638
Thank you.

962
01:30:21,179 --> 01:30:22,179
Xiao Xian.

963
01:30:24,515 --> 01:30:25,815
We were worried sick.

964
01:30:25,817 --> 01:30:29,487
We came as soon
as we got Jaka's phone call.

965
01:30:32,123 --> 01:30:33,123
Jaka?

966
01:30:35,927 --> 01:30:37,627
<i>I have some good news.</i>

967
01:30:37,629 --> 01:30:43,099
<i>We've arrested
the person responsible.</i>

968
01:30:43,101 --> 01:30:46,436
<i>She's being extradited
to Singapore.</i>

969
01:30:54,112 --> 01:30:55,645
Stop right there.

970
01:30:55,647 --> 01:30:58,182
You're under arrest. Get up.

971
01:31:06,791 --> 01:31:09,627
I told you... I had a plan.

972
01:31:11,829 --> 01:31:14,397
Good plan. We almost died.

973
01:31:14,399 --> 01:31:15,767
Next time, you get shot.

974
01:31:25,843 --> 01:31:27,310
Bye.

975
01:31:27,312 --> 01:31:28,479
See you, man.

976
