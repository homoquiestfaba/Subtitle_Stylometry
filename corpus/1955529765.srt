1
00:00:52,054 --> 00:00:54,141
This is pointless.

2
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,166
This is very good, Professor, thank you.

3
00:01:13,046 --> 00:01:14,085
That wasn't so hard, was it?

4
00:01:19,005 --> 00:01:20,093
So does this look wrong to you?

5
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:22,016
Yeah.

6
00:01:23,026 --> 00:01:25,048
Because it is wrong.

7
00:01:25,097 --> 00:01:27,115
Because it's missing 'Bleem'.

8
00:01:29,057 --> 00:01:31,061
You think I just made this up, don't you?

9
00:01:32,055 --> 00:01:34,062
Just pulled this number out of thin air, yah?

10
00:01:34,062 --> 00:01:36,093
So you have discovered 'bleem' then?

11
00:01:36,093 --> 00:01:41,130
I am not entertaining some delusion,
Doctor. I am a mathematician.

12
00:01:42,092 --> 00:01:44,125
I am pursuing the truth.

13
00:01:45,025 --> 00:01:51,117
I'm sorry, I'm not trying to offend you, 
I'm just trying to understand.

14
00:01:52,017 --> 00:01:54,021
But I need you to help me understand.

15
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:57,063
Are you trying to understand 'bleem', Doctor?

16
00:01:59,075 --> 00:02:03,076
Or are you trying to understand me?

17
00:02:48,065 --> 00:02:50,065
Okay, Professor.

18
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:54,160
Let's assume that you're right and 'bleem' does exist.

19
00:02:56,044 --> 00:02:57,051
It'd be a counting number, right?

20
00:02:58,014 --> 00:03:00,038
It is an integer, yah.

21
00:03:00,073 --> 00:03:00,136
Integer.

22
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:06,017
So you go 1, 2, 3...

23
00:03:07,096 --> 00:03:10,102
'bleem,'
4, 5, 6 - is that right?

24
00:03:11,059 --> 00:03:12,122
Very good, Doctor.

25
00:03:14,056 --> 00:03:16,063
Right, so if that's true...

26
00:03:17,026 --> 00:03:21,029
...you should then be able to have 'bleem' of something, right?

27
00:03:21,095 --> 00:03:23,139
Yeah.

28
00:03:26,096 --> 00:03:29,134
I'd like you to do me a favor, Professor.

29
00:03:33,085 --> 00:03:36,109
Separate out 'bleem' of those jellybeans for me.

30
00:03:42,008 --> 00:03:44,010
Please...

31
00:03:44,028 --> 00:03:46,104
...take your time.

32
00:04:35,099 --> 00:04:37,147
So 'bleem' is not an integer after all.

33
00:04:45,006 --> 00:04:47,012
Professor.

34
00:04:49,003 --> 00:04:50,067
So 'Bleem' is not an integer...

35
00:04:50,094 --> 00:04:50,186
AHH!

36
00:04:52,087 --> 00:04:53,172
Bleem exists!

37
00:04:55,016 --> 00:04:56,063
Calm down, Professor.

38
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:58,124
Something was preventing me...

39
00:04:59,046 --> 00:05:02,075
I was sitting right here.
I was watching you the entire time

40
00:05:02,096 --> 00:05:03,135
and there was nothing preventing you,

41
00:05:04,035 --> 00:05:08,040
except for the fact
that 'bleem' does not exist.

42
00:05:09,044 --> 00:05:12,056
I must get back to my research...

43
00:05:15,078 --> 00:05:17,169
I'm sorry, Professor. I'm afraid we're done for the day.

44
00:05:20,006 --> 00:05:22,064
I just need something to write with.

45
00:05:23,049 --> 00:05:25,096
Please. Pencil and paper is all I ask.

46
00:05:25,096 --> 00:05:29,190
We can talk about writing materials
at your next evaluation, alright?

47
00:05:45,042 --> 00:05:46,070
Doctor?

48
00:05:48,013 --> 00:05:50,052
Take the Professor to his room.

49
00:05:50,052 --> 00:05:53,074
Please, I am so close. I can feel it.

50
00:05:53,074 --> 00:05:54,090
We can pick this up tomorrow.

51
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:54,075
Come on, Professor.

52
00:05:55,056 --> 00:05:55,145
No.

53
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:01,052
Take it easy!

54
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:52,098
So would you say you are a man of reason, Professor?

55
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:54,037
Of course, yah.

56
00:07:54,037 --> 00:07:56,079
Well, I'm a little confused...

57
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:01,123
...what reason could anybody possibly 
have to keep a number secret?

58
00:08:02,076 --> 00:08:05,932
Why did they try to burn Galileo
at the stake, Doctor?

59
00:08:06,806 --> 00:08:10,532
This is heresy to them.

60
00:08:11,232 --> 00:08:15,470
We're talking about the very
fabric of our universe here.

61
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:20,114
What do you know about higher dimensions, Doctor?

62
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,130
What, like parallel universes?

63
00:08:24,049 --> 00:08:28,083
No, these are dimensions beyond what we can experience with our senses.

64
00:08:29,058 --> 00:08:34,777
The first four are taken up by the Minkowski
Space-Time, which we live with every day.

65
00:08:35,094 --> 00:08:40,103
But physicists now tell us there are at least
seven more dimensions we cannot access.

66
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:46,064
Abstract dimensions that permeate everything -
yet remain completely hidden.

67
00:08:51,094 --> 00:08:52,135
Alright.

68
00:08:53,035 --> 00:08:58,080
We have no way to grasp the possibilities,
to tap us the potential of these dimensions

69
00:08:58,008 --> 00:09:00,075
because we haven't got the math.

70
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:08,170
So you are suggesting that with 'bleem'-

71
00:09:10,002 --> 00:09:14,054
'Bleem' changes everything.

72
00:09:16,058 --> 00:09:18,089
Thank you, Professor.

73
00:10:07,048 --> 00:10:08,137
Hey!

74
00:10:17,035 --> 00:10:18,063
Hey!

75
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:34,125
This next report comes from Stockbridge,
Massachusetts, where on Thursday

76
00:10:34,386 --> 00:10:40,542
an unidentified man was struck and killed by a car near Pinewood Elementary school.

77
00:10:40,542 --> 00:10:45,281
But beyond the tragedy, a mystery has
emerged as authorities have made no progress

78
00:10:45,281 --> 00:10:49,430
in determining the victim's identity
in the three days since the incident.

79
00:10:49,043 --> 00:10:53,110
Police Chief Hal Malick is referring to
the lack of any leads as 'bizarre'.

80
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:56,045
More on the story as it develops.

81
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,074
In other news...

82
00:11:20,057 --> 00:11:21,089
Yeah?

83
00:11:42,057 --> 00:11:44,075
We're doing a second sweep now.

84
00:11:44,075 --> 00:11:47,160
He was definitely here at bedcheck,
I haven't let anyone into the room.

85
00:12:32,073 --> 00:12:36,075
Ah, looks like he left us a little snack.

86
00:12:38,026 --> 00:12:39,105
Don't touch those!

87
00:12:53,002 --> 00:12:58,015
It's just jellybeans, Doc. Want one?
