1
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,989
(whispers) Miss Bird...

2
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,991
...said...

3
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,751
...brightly.

4
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,394
(birds twittering)

5
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,435
(twittering reverberates)

6
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,033
(doctor)
Does that make you feel funny, son?

7
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,277
You don't feel woozy?
Like you might faint?

8
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,550
- No, sir.
- Good.

9
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,274
I know it's writin', Thad.

10
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,389
This all started just about the same time
you started with your stories.

11
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,433
- Sittin' in the dark, squintin' to see.
- (doctor) Hm.

12
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,793
Couldn't that be it, Doctor? Couldn't
all this come from strainin' his eyes?

13
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,391
Possibly. But these sounds,
these bird sounds he's hearing.

14
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,435
Sometimes a smell or a sound can be
a sign of something more than eyestrain.

15
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,229
I don't think we have an emergency,
but we'll have to watch it, Thad.

16
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,590
- Wanna be a writer, do ya?
- Yes, sir.

17
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,678
If he's so determined,
you oughta buy the man a typewriter.

18
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,149
We have our eye on a used one.

19
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,311
Been savin' up for it.

20
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,513
Maybe we ought to go ahead
and buy it, huh, Thad?

21
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,238
Seven-thirty, Thad. You'll miss your bus.

22
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,950
Let's go, hotshot.

23
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,711
Thaddeus.

24
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,238
My Lord. All this in one mornin'?

25
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,596
(whispers) Thaddeus!

26
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,315
Polly! There's something
wrong with Thad Beaumont.

27
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,194
Stay in your seats. Stay in your seats.

28
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,235
Thad? What's wrong, honey?

29
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,438
Three-by-five-centimetre window in
the upper-left anterior portion of the skull.

30
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,353
- (nurse) BP is steady at 120 over 80.
- I'm opening.

31
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,552
- Oh, my.
- (anaesthetist) Slight fluctuation.

32
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,672
Hilary! Remember where you are, please.

33
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,238
(nurse) Respiration normal at 65.

34
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,396
(screams)

35
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,349
- Get someone in here.
- What in the world is it?

36
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,433
It's nothing. Once it was a twin.

37
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,989
- Now it's nothing.
- A twin?

38
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,634
Unborn, but absorbed into the system.

39
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,792
We'll continue with 18 units of valium,
packed cells.

40
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,389
We have an eye...

41
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,075
...part of a nostril...

42
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,952
...two teeth.

43
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,674
Hm. One of the teeth has a small cavity.

44
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,517
A year ago this was probably
submicroscopic in size.

45
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,397
Somehow it... got itself going again.
The damn thing actually started to grow.

46
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,074
- Incredible.
- Don't ask me why.

47
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,232
All I know is that we've located
a very rare sort of... tumour.

48
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,873
Close call, folks,
but I think we got here just in time.

49
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,952
I'm getting
a slight elevation in blood pressure.

50
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,829
What the hell...?

51
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,957
Beautiful in Atlanta, no delays. Dallas,
Fort Worth, experiencing thunderstorms.

52
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,073
Watch out for serious weather in this
area. Could be some tornado activity.

53
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,478
Strong thunderstorms back through
the central Rockies as well.

54
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,189
Honey, can I... Can Mommy have that?
Thank you very much.

55
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,919
William. Don't... don't do that, buddy.

56
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,753
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- A born editor.

57
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,869
- It's not that bad, is it?
- (William gurgles)

58
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,231
Guess it is. Just a sec.
I got something for you.

59
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,310
I act like a pure klutz.

60
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,515
There. Play with these things.

61
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,638
- What do you think, Mommy?
- Sh. Just a minute. I'm on the last page.

62
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,515
- Not much?
- Not much?

63
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,869
- It's wonderful.
- There's not a lot there.

64
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,275
I stay up all night
and produce nine lousy pages.

65
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,598
- Nine perfect pages. It's great.
- But is it a best seller?

66
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,553
Who cares?
It's gonna be a great book, Thad.

67
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,309
You're doing it.
You are actually really doing it.

68
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,279
Oh...

69
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,671
It's not comin' outta me easy.

70
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,513
(Thad) We are human beings. Plural.

71
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,756
Each one of us is two separate beings.

72
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,350
There's the outer being,
the one we show to the world at large.

73
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,750
Inhibited, timid...

74
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,828
- Often a pathological liar.
- (laughter)

75
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,515
And then there's the inner being.

76
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,190
The truthful one.

77
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,355
Passionate, uninhibited, even lustful.

78
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,799
And most of us keep that inner being
hidden away, locked up.

79
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:15,275
But the fiction writer doesn't have to hide
it, doesn't have to keep it from anything.

80
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,278
He can let it out,
bring it out in the open, let it live.

81
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,910
Hell, he can give it the car keys, let it ride!

82
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,230
Yes!

83
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,197
In fact, he has to do that.

84
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,268
It's essential. The writer has to let
that inner being out of the lockup.

85
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,991
He has to let it have a voice in his work
otherwise the work itself will be inhibited.

86
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,350
Timid. Without passion.

87
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,909
It'll be a pack of lies.

88
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,352
I think we'll cut it short today.
I was up all night working.

89
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,433
- That inner being kept me awake. I...
- (laughter)

90
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,230
Your stories are due on Wednesday.
Don't forget.

91
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,038
Uh, w...
would you autograph your book for me?

92
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,752
Just make it out to Fred. Fred Clawson.

93
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,154
- That's not my book.
- Isn't it?

94
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,151
No. Look here.

95
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,311
Hm?

96
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,716
The picture's a phoney.

97
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,350
The name too. "George Stark. "

98
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,192
Phoney.

99
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,470
I know all about it.

100
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,719
(Clawson)
It's my turn to be storyteller, OK?

101
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,151
There's this writer, see?
Let's call him "Beaumont".

102
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,552
He writes a coupla highbrow books
about yuppies and faggots.

103
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,433
The critics rave but nobody buys,
so he changes his style.

104
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,636
He starts writing
about tits and tough guys.

105
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,354
- He dreams up this badass character.
- Machine.

106
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,511
- Yeah.
- Alexis Machine.

107
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:21,438
He calls himself George Stark, so his
mother won't find out he writes this shit.

108
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,718
He slaps a phoney picture on the back,
boom! He sells a million copies.

109
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,469
So he writes three more of these things.
Boom, boom, boom. He gets rich.

110
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,037
- Not that rich.
- Rich enough, I think. Rich enough.

111
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,708
So, what's he gonna write next?

112
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,276
A nice big cheque, if he wants me
to keep my mouth shut about this.

113
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,789
And if he doesn't want?

114
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,913
- What if he doesn't care what you do?
- Oh, he wants. He cares.

115
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,230
And if he doesn't,
the people around him do.

116
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,317
They got a major-league scam goin' here.

117
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:00,230
There's a million Americans out there just
waiting to lay out their 29 and change...

118
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,271
...for George to give 'em another hard-on.

119
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,156
They believe in George Stark. They
believe he's writin' about shit he knows.

120
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,438
They find out they've been lied to, that 29
and change might go back in the pocket.

121
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,798
And I don't think you or the people
around you wanna take that chance.

122
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,551
- How'd you find out?
- This babe who works for your publisher.

123
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,799
I live in New York. She gave me the whole
story. It's like Machine says in your book.

124
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,152
"At nine o'clock, she came.
At ten o'clock, she came across. "

125
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:38,038
I've written about slime before, Clawson,
but none of it as low to the ground as you.

126
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,357
- Maybe you'll put me in a book someday.
- Oh, I will.

127
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,028
And I'll make you suffer.

128
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,435
Before you die.

129
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,677
Uh, look,
I got a bus to catch back to New York.

130
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,751
You think about it.

131
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,951
- "To Fred"?
- Huh?

132
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,237
Oh, yeah.

133
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:10,958
Look, you talk to your people, see what
it's worth to keep this outta the papers.

134
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:17,516
I'll call you in a few days, and
we can negotiate the, uh, payment plan.

135
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,359
Oh, and thanks for the autograph.

136
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,956
(wife) Don't go crazy over this.
We'll figure out a way to handle it.

137
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,277
Oh, it's just such an invasion.
Who needs this shit?

138
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,873
- (metallic thud)
- (babies cry)

139
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,951
Oh...

140
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,830
OK, come on. You're gonna help me.
They're both up.

141
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,677
Who's the best boy? Who's the best boy?

142
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,550
Who's all wet? Whoo-oo.

143
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,669
OK. OK.

144
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,396
There you go.

145
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,109
OK, just a minute, swirly-whirly.

146
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:07,038
I know how you could blow this guy off,
really knock him for a loop.

147
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,708
- I'd like to knock him for a loop.
- (baby gurgles)

148
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,959
Little stinker.
That dirty little stinker. That little rat.

149
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,754
I oughta go get him.
That's what Alexis Machine would do.

150
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,157
He'd cut off his pecker
and shove it in his little rat mouth...

151
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,756
...so when they found him,
they'd know he was a squealer.

152
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,949
- How can I knock him for a loop?
- Go to the press yourself.

153
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,355
Tell them "I'm George Stark. "

154
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,636
OK, come on.

155
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,316
Eat hearty. If I do this crazy thing
your mother's talkin' about...

156
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,397
...we'll end up livin' on cat food.

157
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:59,515
I think Thad Beaumont can sell enough
books to keep his family off the streets.

158
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:06,110
What do you guys think, huh? Is it
time to say "Bye-bye, Uncle George?"

159
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,837
Yeah. Hm.

160
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,315
Well, I guess it's unanimous.

161
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,314
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

162
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,991
Oh, no.

163
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,550
- Shit!
- That's all right.

164
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,276
- I think I cooked it a little too long.
- No, it'II... it'll be good.

165
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,352
(she laughs)

166
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:44,796
So that's the story, Rick. It seems like
going public is the right thing to do.

167
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:50,194
I just need to know you're all right with it.
Stark earns a lot more for you than I do.

168
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,996
Well, hey, if you don't want me to do
this, I'll give it some more thought.

169
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,357
Yeah.

170
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,790
Yeah... No, absolutely.

171
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,911
Oh, yeah, sure we have.

172
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,071
- Miriam? What, is she there?
- (whispers) Are you kidding?

173
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,191
You guys patching things up?

174
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,710
No such thing. We're committed
to making our divorce work.

175
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,390
But she still is my business partner.
She's picking up the extension.

176
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:25,276
Thad, your new book is gonna
win awards and sell 200,000 hardback.

177
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,035
Who needs George Stark?
We'll help you get rid of him.

178
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,189
I'll put out a press release, you can
do the talk shows. I say hallelujah.

179
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,960
You heard the lady, Thad.
We're with you 100o/, baby.

180
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,469
Bye, Thad. Kiss the babies for me.

181
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,035
- Bye-bye.
- Talk to you soon.

182
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,277
- Shit.
- He shouldn't be writing trash.

183
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,989
We have a lot of clients
who can make us money with trash.

184
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,829
I like trash. I love trash.
I read George Stark cos it's fun.

185
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,349
I read Thad Beaumont
because it's my job.

186
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:59,030
That's why we now live
across town from each other.

187
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,949
Let's get back to work.

188
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,189
(Rick) So we kill off George Stark.
OK, that's OK. We kill off Stark.

189
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,676
Hey, maybe Beaumont's books
start to sell. Who knows?

190
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:20,231
Stranger things have happened.
Stranger things have happened.

191
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,800
- You're not sold on this?
- It's the money, Liz.

192
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,072
We're used to a pretty nice life.
Flushing that away just...

193
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,398
Be honest, Thad. You don't wanna give up
George. You've become attached to him.

194
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:39,310
Yeah, well, I mean, is that so weird? I've
been working with the guy for a long time.

195
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,353
I'm used to him. I like having him around.

196
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,719
Sure. He lets you do what you want, say
anything you want, be anything you want.

197
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,275
He's your drinking buddy.

198
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,555
Liz, I'm not an alcoholic. Hm?

199
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,396
- George Stark is.
- Oh, come on.

200
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,877
You don't realise what you're like
when you write those books, do you?

201
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:03,392
- It's like watching Jekyll turn into Hyde.
- That's a little extreme.

202
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,908
I'm not out raping barmaids.

203
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:09,596
Thad Beaumont gave up drinking.
He gave up smoking. George Stark didn't.

204
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,712
And these god-awful moods you get in...

205
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,390
You say these really
mean things sometimes.

206
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,395
Look, I am who I am, Liz.
It's all me. It's all part of me.

207
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,310
Even the ugliness is a part of me.

208
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,192
"Machine turned the razor down
and slashed the strop in two. "

209
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,949
"A long section fell to the floor
like a severed tongue. "

210
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,429
"'Cut him' Jack Rainsley said eagerly.
'Cut him while I stand and watch. "'

211
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,750
"'I wanna see the blood flow. "'

212
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,431
"Halstead squeezed his eyes shut, but the
razor slid effortlessly through the lid...

213
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,673
...and punctured the eyeball beneath
with a faint popping sound. "

214
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,752
"'I'm back' Machine said.
'I'm back from the dead...

215
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,317
...and you don't seem glad to see me at all,
you ungrateful son of a bitch. "'

216
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:02,629
Yeah, well. I hope you're not looking for
any social significance, Mr Donaldson...

217
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,394
...because there ain't none to be found.

218
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,109
You're the New Yorker.
I can tell by the hair.

219
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,995
Mike Donaldson, People Magazine.
You're, uh... the photographer?

220
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,954
Yes, sir. Homer Gamache.
I'm gonna do this up brown for you.

221
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,435
And you're Thad Beaumont.

222
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,355
Seen you around town. Whoever'd
have thought you was a celebrity?

223
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:43,997
- I'm not the celebrity. George Stark is.
- Well, we're here to change that.

224
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,159
Come on, you guys. Let's go.
Thad, will you grab my purse, please?

225
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,436
- Yeah.
- OK. All right.

226
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,830
All right, I got the diaper bag.

227
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,275
- You've got a terrific getaway.
- Thank you.

228
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,829
- (doorbell)
- Oh, excuse me.

229
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,749
We can never get up here. When Thad's
teaching, we have to stay in the city.

230
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,315
Trudy, thanks for coming over.

231
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,274
- Did they take pictures of the little ones?
- No.

232
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,592
Good. Kidnappers around, you know.

233
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,439
They might see a picture,
it might give 'em some ideas.

234
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,750
They're not gonna take
pictures of the kids.

235
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,350
Not while I'm around they won't.
These men make a mess, don't they?

236
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,710
- Well...
- Come on, let's go upstairs.

237
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,389
I'm doin' a series of photographs.
You... you might be interested in this.

238
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,355
Photographs of teddy bears.

239
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,233
Lyin' in coffins!
I wanna make 'em into a book.

240
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:47,560
The final perfect comment
on the American way of... death.

241
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,034
All this folderol we put ourselves through.

242
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,316
Hate funerals. Hate any kind of folderol.

243
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,432
I'll show it to you when it's done.

244
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:01,639
Who knows?
Maybe you'd like to... write the text.

245
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,671
Not much of a view.

246
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,516
If I had a window in here I think
I'd just sit and stare at the lake all day.

247
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:20,271
This is where George Stark
came into being. Right here in this room.

248
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,195
- I noticed the old typewriter.
- Yeah, I've had that since I was a boy.

249
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,960
- I still use it. George doesn't.
- You're kidding.

250
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,515
No. George doesn't hold with typewriters.

251
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,188
George uses one of these.

252
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,149
From day one, he's used these.

253
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,229
You really are serious?

254
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,590
Dead serious. It's the truth.

255
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,398
- Was it hard to get George started?
- No.

256
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,750
One evening I was just sitting here.

257
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,315
I picked up one of these pencils.

258
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,638
Before I knew it, I'd written 16 pages
without a single scratch-out.

259
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,756
It was like George just...

260
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,235
...woke up and started to talk.

261
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,751
You'II, uh... forgive me for noting...

262
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,394
...but these behaviours
could be interpreted...

263
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,199
...as classic symptoms of schizophrenia.

264
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,432
Yes, I'll forgive you for noting that.

265
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,668
I don't think George would, though.

266
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,670
I don't think George would like any of this,
Mr Donaldson.

267
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,673
This isn't George's idea of a fun morning.

268
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:39,310
In fact, I think it's safe to say that George
would want your balls for breakfast.

269
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,919
- Thaddeus. Elizabeth.
- Hi, Digger.

270
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,640
I hope you don't mind crazy Homer.

271
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,998
- He wants to set up a fake tombstone.
- A fake tombstone?

272
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,953
"You don't want to go
walkin' on the dead" I says.

273
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,596
"Make sure you use an empty plot
where nobody's buried. "

274
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,633
Then I remembered
"Thad Beaumont owns one"...

275
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:23,032
...that your daddy bought for you over here
near where your ma and pa is buried.

276
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,549
So I said "Why don't you use that?"

277
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,320
So, I hope you don't mind.

278
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,511
This is where Homer is settin' up.

279
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,712
GEORGE STARK 1985-1991
GEEN AARDIGE vENT

280
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:39,276
This was my idea. I was takin' pictures
of teddy bears when I thought of it.

281
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,548
Ain't it a hoot? I told you
I was gonna do this up brown for ya.

282
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:49,278
Must be strange for you, Thad.
Kinda like standing over your own grave.

283
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,309
You know, I just... I really think
that this is, you know, a little much.

284
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,636
- Yeah.
- Aw, it's good fun, is all.

285
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,196
- New York's gonna love it. Wait and see.
- The American way of death.

286
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,756
That's it! A little folderol
for old George there.

287
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,556
- Come on in now. We're losin' the light.
- Why not just take a couple of Thad?

288
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,671
All right. OK.

289
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,718
Come in near the stone.
I'll just be a minute now.

290
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,956
Damned if it don't look real.

291
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,350
- What are these?
- (Homer) That's it. That's it.

292
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,154
Now, how about you two, uh...

293
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,312
- (Homer) What? Oh. All right, all right.
- Oh, much better.

294
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,433
- How about you two shakin' hands?
- Shaking hands now?

295
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,240
Yeah, shakin' hands over top of the stone.

296
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,352
Come on! It's all in fun.
That's it. Now, smile.

297
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,869
Act like you're enjoyin'
the hell out of this.

298
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,753
- (Thad) Oh, we are.
- For all the world to see.

299
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,756
- (Liz) Are you sorry you did it?
- (Thad) I'm only sorry about two things.

300
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,269
One, we look like a pair of idiots.

301
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,869
What's number two?

302
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,311
(sighs) I just know we can't
hide from publicity any more.

303
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,319
We've had it pretty easy
in that department.

304
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:10,274
You'll be flavour of the month, they
forget you, then you win the Pulitzer.

305
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,671
- What else? Come on.
- Nothin'.

306
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,076
Honestly?

307
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,876
Honestly.

308
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,633
You gotta be kiddin', pal.
At one in the damn a. m.?

309
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,389
Hey, that looks like...

310
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,510
What the hell...?

311
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,390
The American way of death, Homer.
Without any folderol!

312
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:03,789
Digger, calm down. I'll get somebody
over right away. Right away.

313
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,235
(clears throat) Digger Holt.

314
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,271
- Seein' ghosts again?
- Yep.

315
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,357
- Hm.
- Where's Norris?

316
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,596
Out on a call.
You want me to track him down?

317
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,519
- (phone rings)
- No. I'll go myself.

318
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,359
- I'll be over at Homeland.
- All right.

319
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,399
I'll be here. Castle Rock Police.

320
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,797
H... here we are, Sheriff.

321
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,275
Don't it look like what I said?

322
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,836
Don't it look like somebody
dug his way out of there?

323
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,552
Like somebody was buried alive
and dug his way out?

324
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:58,913
Someone dug a hole in your graveyard.
That's all it is, nothin' more.

325
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,589
But somebody was in there, Sheriff.

326
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,952
Look here.

327
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:09,358
He set his hands in the dirt here
to boost hisself out.

328
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,599
So whoever dug the hole
got down in it to do the diggin'.

329
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,190
You got yourself a clear case
of vandalism. That's the way I see it.

330
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,437
This is where they set up
for that picture in the magazine.

331
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:24,991
- Yeah. Picture of the Beaumonts. I saw it.
- Well, this here's the Beaumont plot.

332
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,954
And this hole is a-sittin' right smack
where they set up that fake tombstone.

333
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,037
It's just a hole in the ground.

334
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,835
Forget it, Digger.
Fill the damn thing in and forget it.

335
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,437
- Pangborn here.
- Yeah, Sheriff, it's Marty.

336
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:47,753
Me and Norris just found old Homer
Gamache, deader than a squashed coon.

337
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,837
(siren)

338
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,198
- Jesus!
- Guy across the street saw Homer...

339
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,392
...stop last night to pick up
a hitchhiker about, uh, 1am.

340
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,757
White male.
We figure he popped him for his truck.

341
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,235
We got a description out on it.

342
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,000
He took his leg. He took his damn leg.

343
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,472
No, he didn't take it. It's over there.

344
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,279
That's what he beat him with.
Beat him with his own wooden leg.

345
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,640
He was just an old man,
you son of a bitch.

346
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:44,991
Why didn't you just clip him one,
take his truck and leave him be?

347
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,388
Why this? I hope I get
a chance to ask you.

348
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:59,678
I want everybody in the world lookin'
for that truck. I wanna get this fucker.

349
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,554
Ask Mama if she believes this.

350
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:07,276
He drove it like this? All the way
from Maine, he drove it like this?

351
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,436
Ask Mama if she believes this.

352
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,234
- So, how was it? How was New York?
- Noisy.

353
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:36,673
God, I'm so sick of the same old
questions, over and over again.

354
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,469
"Tell us about the pencils. "
"Why'd you give him a prison record?"

355
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,955
"Why do you suppose
Machine is so popular?"

356
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,632
- Thanks a lot, Donna.
- You're welcome. They were great.

357
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,429
Listen, I know they're a handful.
Say hi to your mom for me.

358
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,435
- Are you Elizabeth Beaumont?
- Yes.

359
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,754
- Alan?
- Is your husband home, Mrs Beaumont?

360
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,671
Well, yes, he is.
Alan, is there some kind of problem?

361
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,753
It's all right. I know these folks.
We have to talk to Thad, Liz.

362
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,159
Well, sure. Come on in. I'll call him.

363
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,355
Alan. What are you doin' in Ludlow?

364
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,755
Are you Thaddeus Beaumont?

365
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,837
Yeah.

366
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,157
What's goin' on, Alan?

367
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:28,039
We're here to question you
in connection with a capital crime.

368
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,312
- You have the right to remain silent...
- Jesus, what is this?

369
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,070
You have to right to legal counsel.
If you cannot afford legal counsel...

370
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,952
...such will be provided for you.

371
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,913
I don't know why you're 160 miles
out of your territory...

372
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,311
...lookin' at me like I was birdshit
on a new car, but I'll tell you this:

373
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:46,557
I won't answer any questions
until you tell me what's goin' on.

374
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,796
It's about Homer Gamache.

375
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,637
Uh...

376
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,991
- Oh, the photographer. What about him?
- He's been murdered.

377
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,430
- Jesus. By who?
- Evidence says you did it.

378
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:59,309
- This is a... Alan! This is a joke.
- Can you account for your whereabouts...

379
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:03,434
...during the time period from 11 pm
last Friday until 1am Saturday morning?

380
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,275
Yes. I was in New York.
I just got back today a little while ago.

381
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:12,270
- (Alan) How long were you there?
- I left Friday, four o'clock out of Bangor.

382
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,194
Anyone meet you there?
Did you do anything that night?

383
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:20,474
No. I... Let's see. I called my agent, Rick
Cowley, to let him know I was comin' in.

384
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,035
You called him, but you didn't see him.

385
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,277
- You think I'm lying to ya?
- There is that possibility...

386
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,357
...and I've got to consider it.

387
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:33,031
From what I know about you, you're not
the kind of person to do a thing like this.

388
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,470
None of that counts
when it comes to doin' my job.

389
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,319
Look, call TWA,
or the hotel, Sherry Netherland.

390
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,556
They must have a record
of when I checked in.

391
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,274
(Liz) We haven't been
up to Castle Rock for weeks.

392
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,438
Why are you so determined
to lay this off on Thad?

393
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,911
Because he thinks I did it. He thinks I did...

394
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,559
(twittering)

395
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,275
(Liz) Thad? Are you OK?

396
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,634
Honey, are you all right?

397
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,756
- (twittering subsides)
- Hm?

398
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,837
Are you OK?

399
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,429
Yeah. Yeah, I'm all right.

400
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,475
If this turns out to be a mistake...

401
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:17,071
...I will personally find the man who
screwed up this ID and pull his skin off.

402
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:21,876
What ID? What's this evidence you have?
I mean, why? Why me?

403
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,277
First off, there's the connection
between you and Homer.

404
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:29,075
- (Thad) The pictures.
- One was taken in Homeland Cemetery.

405
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,954
- Yeah. So?
- Someone went there Friday night...

406
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,310
...and dug a hole in your family plot.

407
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,591
A hole big enough to bury a man.

408
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,268
Homer was murdered
less than a mile away.

409
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,194
Look, Thad, this can't be.
Somebody is doing this to...

410
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,595
It's that creep. It's Clawson.

411
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,518
- Who?
- There's this guy, Fred Clawson.

412
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,554
Lives in New York. I don't know where. He
found out I wrote the George Stark books.

413
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:56,309
He was threatening to blackmail me.
That's why I went public.

414
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,318
We'll ask NYPD to check him out.

415
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,911
What else you got, Alan?

416
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:08,154
I don't believe you'd track me all the way
here just because of a hole in the ground.

417
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,276
The killer took Homer's pickup truck.

418
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:14,434
A Connecticut trooper found it in
a used-car lot just north of the state line.

419
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:19,196
They found fingerprints in the truck,
some of 'em stamped in Homer's blood.

420
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:24,031
They fed 'em into a graphics computer
and your service record came back.

421
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,196
Your prints match up.

422
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,277
Exactly.

423
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:59,229
(Elvis Presley)
I wonder if... you're lonesome tonight.

424
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:04,990
You know, someone said that the world's
a stage, and each of us must play a part.

425
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,590
Fate had me playing in love,
with you as my sweetheart.

426
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,476
Act One was when we met.

427
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,754
I loved you at first glance.

428
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,837
You read your lines so tenderly.

429
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,477
(eerie laughter)

430
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:26,356
Then came Act Two.
Using the change, you acted strange...

431
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,471
...and why, I'll never know.

432
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:37,677
(young Thad) Miss Bird said... brightly...

433
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,558
(Stark)
Down here, we call that fool's stuffing.

434
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,149
What do you mean, "down here"?

435
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:52,719
Endsville, Thad. The place
where all rail service terminates.

436
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,717
(toy squeaks)

437
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,673
You always were the clumsy one,
old Hoss.

438
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,149
Then they can bring the curtain down.

439
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,750
(Stark) I'm not done with you,
cock-knocker.

440
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,554
Remember that.
You don't wanna fuck with me.

441
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,149
Cos when you fuck with me...

442
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,275
...you're fuckin' with the best.

443
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,432
Clawson. There's police here to see you.

444
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,715
Clawson? You owe me two weeks' rent.

445
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:16,230
If these guys are here to take you away,
I want it now!

446
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,590
Let's check it out.

447
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,351
Jesus! (retches)

448
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,311
(Liz) He's back.

449
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,909
(knocking at door) Thad?

450
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,436
- He's back.
- Who's back?

451
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,318
Alan Pangborn.

452
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:11,993
I wondered if we could all just
sit down and have a cold one.

453
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,278
No.

454
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,357
Yeah. I'll have one.

455
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,591
I have no business bein' here...

456
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:26,272
...socialisin' with a man who is now
a suspect in not just one murder...

457
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,675
...but two.

458
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:32,196
- Two?
- Yeah. Your buddy. Frederick Clawson.

459
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,674
- (Liz) God!
- When?

460
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:38,277
Night before last.
In New York, while you were still there.

461
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,552
Night, uh... night before last.
Night before last, I was at...

462
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:46,150
You were at a press reception
till about 11 o'clock.

463
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,788
We think Clawson was killed
around nine or ten...

464
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,434
...but it could have been
as late as midnight.

465
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,990
We got another set of fingerprints
out of Clawson's apartment.

466
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,998
Once again, they match yours exactly.

467
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,509
Christ! What is going on, Thad?

468
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,030
Well, I'm surprised you brought beer,
not handcuffs.

469
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,800
- What's keepin' me outta jail?
- Me, I guess.

470
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,037
New York guys think
you should be brought in.

471
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,198
- Why are you lettin' me off the hook?
- I'm not.

472
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,233
You're still very much on the hook, Thad.

473
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,477
And if you killed these people,
I'm gonna pull you in the boat.

474
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,753
I figure you're not goin' anywhere.
Hard for a man like you to hide.

475
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,635
I'm willin' to let you sleep at home
while I work on this some more.

476
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,035
Meanwhile you build a case
to beat my alibis.

477
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:34,313
I'm not tryin' to beat your alibis
any more than I'm tryin' to prove 'em.

478
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:38,399
I was so sure it was Clawson.
Well, suppose he killed himself.

479
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:43,231
- He could make that look like Thad did it.
- The way he died, that's impossible.

480
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,194
Did anybody else know that
you and Clawson were connected?

481
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:51,029
Clawson got his information from
someone who works for my publisher.

482
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:55,518
That's all he told me. I don't have a name.
You mentioned the way he was killed.

483
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,439
Yeah. It looked like a, uh,
classic gangland hit.

484
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,990
- Shot?
- No, no. You don't shoot a blabbermouth.

485
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,555
You make him bleed. Make him suffer.

486
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,671
Clawson's tongue was cut out.

487
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:10,753
He was castrated
and his penis stuffed into his mouth.

488
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,317
That's exactly what I said
I wanted to do to him. I was joking.

489
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,434
I said if I was Alexis Machine,
that's exactly what I would do.

490
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,397
That's a character in one of his books.
Alexis Machine.

491
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,475
It was a joke.

492
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,589
Come on, Alan. Would I admit
that to you if I killed the guy?

493
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:38,231
There was somethin'
written on the wall at Clawson's.

494
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:41,193
Written in the victim's blood.

495
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,550
"The sparrows are flying again. "

496
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,432
Does that mean anything to either of you?

497
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,716
- No.
- Thad?

498
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,036
No.

499
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,751
You're sure?

500
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,315
Doesn't mean a th... thing.

501
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,433
(Liz) You're keepin' secrets, Thad.
That's no good. It never was.

502
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,513
Some psychotic out there
has killed two people that we know...

503
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,029
...and has somehow
made it look like you did it.

504
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,435
This guy's obviously out to get you.

505
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:21,033
I mean, have you considered
that you might be in danger?

506
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:24,073
That all of us might be next
on this guy's hit list?

507
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,670
Now, come on, Thad. This is not
a good time to be holdin' things back.

508
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,229
No, it's not a good time.

509
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,515
The sparrows are flying again.

510
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,113
It means something to you. What is it?

511
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,396
Oh, Thad. What is goin' on?

512
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,356
There's more.

513
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:54,517
I wrote those words
and I don't remember doing it.

514
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,399
I was in some kind of... trance.

515
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:03,275
The tumour I had when I was a boy.
I told you about the headaches it caused.

516
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,148
- Did I ever tell you about the sounds?
- Sounds? No.

517
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:11,474
People with brain tumours sometimes
have symptoms, sensory precursors.

518
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:17,673
They smell things, hear things, that
aren't actually there. I used to hear birds.

519
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,748
I've started hearing them again.

520
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:28,236
Thad, you have to go and see the doctor.
Maybe you have another tumour.

521
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,477
That would explain the sounds.
But what about the rest of it?

522
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,558
Liz, I blanked out
for an entire period of time.

523
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:40,478
I wrote those words,
and I have no recollection of doing it.

524
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,198
I mean,
what if there are other things I've done?

525
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,313
What if there are other things I've done...
that I can't remember?

526
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,834
Thad! I'm delighted to see that
they haven't incarcerated you.

527
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,076
Sounds like the police have been in touch.

528
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,477
They wanted me to confirm that
you were a man of good character.

529
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:11,035
I lied, and told them that you were.

530
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,830
- Are you in trouble, Thad?
- I'm in somethin'.

531
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,270
Just a mix-up, I think, but it's got me goin'.

532
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,557
Any way I can help?

533
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,552
There's some weird shit goin' on. I could
use some help from an old witch doctor.

534
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:30,799
- Come, let's talk.
- I can't, Reggie. I'm... scrambled. I...

535
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,116
- Call if you need me.
- I will.

536
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,671
Thanks.

537
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,797
(twittering)

538
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,911
(wings fluttering)

539
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,718
(whispers) Endsville...

540
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,272
...for ever.

541
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:23,317
Oh! Oh! Oh! No! No!

542
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,471
No! No! No!

543
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:33,273
Shut up, or I'll have to cut you, sis.

544
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,954
- What do you want?
- What'd I just say?

545
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,274
Now, you're gonna make us
a little telephone call, sissy.

546
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,314
(chuckles) No.
I know what you're thinking.

547
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:58,389
You're thinking you could brain me with
that thing. Not a very happy thought.

548
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:02,275
You know what happens to people
who lose their happy thoughts? Hm?

549
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,398
No!

550
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,272
Argh!

551
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,389
They fall out of the sky.

552
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,831
Now...

553
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,749
We're gonna call us Thad Beaumont.

554
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:28,274
- W... what do I say?
- Oh, you'll think of something.

555
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,199
(Thad) Hi.
We can't come to the phone right now...

556
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:34,278
...but if you leave your name
and number at the beep...

557
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:37,240
...we'll get back to you as soon as we can.

558
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,751
Sh.

559
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:50,075
Tell him who you are
and what's happenin' here.

560
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:53,238
Do it. Don't make me tell you twice.

561
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,039
Do it, or I'll cut
your fuckin' head off with this thing.

562
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:01,994
Thad! Thad, there's... there's a...

563
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:06,239
- Say your name.
... man here, there's a bad man here.

564
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,590
- Say your name.
- Miriam.

565
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:13,271
Please help me! There's a man here.
Please don't let him cut me any more!

566
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,436
(phone rings)

567
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,389
Pangborns... Sure.

568
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,272
Hey, Dad! Phone!

569
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,749
Turn it down a little, son.

570
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,912
- Yeah.
- It's Thad Beaumont.

571
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:43,277
- A lady in New York needs help fast.
- Go ahead. Shoot.

572
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,797
Miriam Cowley. My agent's ex-wife.
She called here. I wasn't home.

573
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,197
I got a recording on my machine.
And I heard a man's voice.

574
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,153
She said he was threatening to hurt her,
uh, to cut her.

575
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,629
She begged me
not to let him do that again.

576
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:58,559
I tried to call her back,
but couldn't get through.

577
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:01,149
- What's the address?
- 109 West 84th.

578
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:04,039
I was gonna call the New York police.

579
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:08,552
No, you did the right thing.
I'll call 'em. I can cut through the shit.

580
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,835
Give me a break here, son.

581
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:21,435
- Problem?
- Yep.

582
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,389
- Bad?
- Well, we can hope.

583
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,393
This is Alan Pangborn...

584
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,438
(phone rings)

585
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,750
Yeah? Yeah, hello?

586
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,671
Oh, God.

587
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,275
Miriam's dead.

588
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,437
Alan, I think there might be
some other people that are in danger.

589
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:07,549
Rick Cowley. I'm sure he's gonna go
after Rick. Now, he lives at 129 East 68th.

590
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,433
And, uh, the guy that wrote that article.

591
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,989
He'll probably go after him.
Mike Donaldson.

592
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,475
He lives in New York too,
but I'm not sure where.

593
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,319
What do you know
that you're not tellin' me?

594
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,909
I think I know who's doing these things.

595
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,275
- Give him to me.
- Not over the phone.

596
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,910
- Can you get here tomorrow?
- I need to know tonight.

597
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:27,911
Can't we do it tomorrow, face to face?

598
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:32,392
Look, I've been tryin' to cut you
every break I can. Don't stretch my limit.

599
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,435
I can give you a description.

600
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,270
I'm not entirely sure it's right...

601
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,475
...but I think it's close.

602
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,675
He's about my size,
blue eyes, same as mine.

603
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:58,994
Hair slicked back. About my age.
In better shape, though. Strong, muscular.

604
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:04,309
He lives in Oxford, Mississippi,
and he's got a little bit of a cracker accent.

605
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:07,788
He might be driving...

606
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,959
...an old black Toronado. It's got
a lot of blasting power under the hood.

607
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,958
It's got letters on the back.
"High Toned Son Of A Bitch".

608
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:17,674
You can tell me all this,
but not who the guy is?

609
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:20,274
Knowing his name tonight
isn't gonna help.

610
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:23,433
He's probably using
the name of George Stark.

611
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,751
Huh? Oh.

612
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,271
Shit!

613
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,876
Goddamn city.

614
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,277
(footsteps)

615
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,277
Oh, no.

616
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,350
(metallic click)

617
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,471
(whistling)

618
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,317
(baby cries)

619
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,277
Ow!

620
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,430
Argh!

621
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,238
Hello, Mike.

622
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,952
Goodbye, Mike.

623
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,515
Ah, Mikey, Mikey, Mikey.

624
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:42,109
Somebody help!

625
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:49,551
- What's going on?
- Murder.

626
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,750
D'you want some?

627
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,998
Whoops! Well, I guess I'd better punt.

628
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,075
(clears throat)

629
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,789
(whistles "Are you Lonesome Tonight?")

630
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:29,395
- What the hell is that down there?
- I don't know. Got your flashlight?

631
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:32,877
- Oh, look at this. Jesus fucking Christ.
- You think this is the guy?

632
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:36,152
- Is this the fuckin' guy...
- How the fuck do I know, huh?

633
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:38,993
- Christ!
- Oh, this is really some shit, man.

634
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,430
- Hey. Hey!
- Forget about it.

635
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,955
- Who the hell is that?
- I don't know. He's gone.

636
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,071
Oh, look at this shit.

637
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:48,191
(phone ringing)

638
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,515
- Hello.
- (Stark) Good mornin', Rick.

639
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:05,632
This is the man who cut
your woman's throat.

640
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,396
What?

641
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:12,389
- Who are you?
- Ask Thad Beaumont who I am.

642
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:16,872
He knows all about it. Tell him
I said you were walkin' around dead...

643
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,793
...and tell him I'm not done
makin' fool's stuffing yet.

644
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,036
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Who are you?

645
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:24,435
(Stark hangs up)

646
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,835
Oh, God! God!

647
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,391
Have a good one, man.

648
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:02,389
Jesus Christ! You asshole!

649
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:04,990
Fuck you!

650
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:13,435
(Alan) So tell me, Thad.
Who do you think is doin' this?

651
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,989
- Give me a name.
- I gave you a name.

652
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,317
The name is George Stark.

653
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:23,556
- I don't think I understand you.
- What my husband is trying to say...

654
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:27,355
...is that he thinks George Stark
has somehow come to life.

655
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,596
Now, look, Alan, I don't expect you to be
the type of guy to believe this, but, um...

656
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,791
...you're all we've got right now.

657
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,309
Thad has some things he's gonna tell you.

658
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:41,559
You don't have to believe him,
but you have to trust that he believes.

659
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:46,038
Because if you don't, this man,
or whatever he is, is gonna go on killing...

660
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:50,597
...and he's gonna keep on killing till
he gets to me and Thad and the babies.

661
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:30,309
You don't believe it, do you?
Not a single word of it.

662
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:33,956
If you'd told me these people
were murdered by a ghost...

663
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:36,037
...I wouldn't believe ya.

664
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:39,630
But I can come closer
to believin' a ghost story than this.

665
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:44,231
You're not just talkin' about a ghost,
you're talkin' about a man who never was.

666
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:46,795
Maybe you'd like to tell me
where this guy came from.

667
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:51,471
Did you just give birth to him one night?
Did he pop out of a damn sparrow's egg?

668
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,151
Exactly how did it go?

669
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:57,392
I don't know when
he became a separate person.

670
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:02,436
It was when we tried to kill him.

671
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:06,958
Look, I'm willing to consider
all sorts of crazy possibilities here.

672
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:10,072
But when you tell me
this guy is George Stark...

673
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:14,632
He might think he's George Stark,
I'll give you that.

674
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,756
But he's not. He can't be.

675
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,316
He's a crazy man, Thad.

676
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:23,115
A goddamn homicidal
lunatic crazy man is what he is.

677
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:27,239
And I'm gonna catch him.

678
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:41,559
Hold it, Mr Cowley. The guys from
communications are supposed to be here.

679
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:44,513
- Maybe they're inside.
- One should be right out here.

680
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:47,518
It's standard procedure. Come on.

681
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:15,432
- Maybe they never showed up.
- Let's try 'em on the radio.

682
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:19,036
- Where they comin' from? Downtown?
- I don't know. Call the precinct.

683
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,356
Look, I gotta get some sleep. I'm dead.

684
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:25,235
- We'll be here.
- Maybe we'll send out for Chinese later.

685
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,510
- My treat.
- Thanks.

686
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:49,076
Jesus Christ!

687
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:55,514
I've decided to change agents.

688
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:59,315
I'm sorry, Rick. It's a cutthroat business.

689
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,349
(Thad) God! Oh, Jesus. Rick...

690
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:25,669
Rick is gone. I don't believe this.

691
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:30,709
I can't believe this. I mean, so much
for your fucking police protection!

692
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:34,988
(Thad) Oh, bullshit! Bullshit!

693
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:38,831
They didn't! No, they didn't!
I don't care what you think.

694
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:42,032
You wanna think about something?
Think about what I told you.

695
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,879
Think about George Stark.
Think about that!

696
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:46,553
What does he want?

697
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:51,436
He wants the same thing you and I would
want if we were in the same position.

698
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:53,989
He doesn't wanna be dead any more!

699
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:05,273
Jesus. Rick... Miriam.

700
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:09,036
Who's next?

701
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:13,756
I, uh... I think that's everything,
Mr Beaumont.

702
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:17,555
We'll call from the outside
to make sure the system's working.

703
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,671
OK, fine. Thank you.

704
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:20,875
(phone rings)

705
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:27,349
We don't have to make a test call. Pull
your meter. I'll check it out in the cellar.

706
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:44,795
Somebody gonna answer it?

707
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:48,549
Mr Beaumont?

708
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:51,320
- Something the matter?
- It's him.

709
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:53,909
It's who?

710
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,036
What do you want, you son of a bitch?

711
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:01,630
(Stark) Cool down, Thad.
No need to get your panties all in a bunch.

712
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:04,639
- What do you want?
- To tell you it's over.

713
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:09,271
I got the last one this noontime. Little girl
who used to work for your publisher.

714
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:13,070
The cops'll find her. Some of her is
on the floor. The rest is on the table.

715
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,236
Jesus Christ!

716
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,715
I'm gonna head down south
and do me some fishin'.

717
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:20,832
- This city life's tirin' me out.
- He's lying.

718
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:24,350
- You lying fuck.
- Why, Thad, that's not very nice.

719
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:28,389
Did you think I was gonna hurt you? Hell,
no. I was gettin' revenge for you, boy.

720
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,955
You knew all along
I was the one that had to do it.

721
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:34,357
- You got a chicken liver.
- He's lying. He knows you're listening.

722
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:37,438
I'm not gonna bother you any more, Thad.

723
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:41,671
I know you're gonna come after us,
George.

724
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:44,229
I know you're gonna come after me.

725
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:47,349
And I think I know what you want.

726
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:49,272
Well, you just come ahead.

727
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:51,596
I'll know you're comin'.

728
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:54,360
- I'll know because I'll hear the birds.
- Birds?

729
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:57,438
That's right.
I'll hear the birds, and I'll be waitin'.

730
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:59,511
Waitin' to fuckin' take you apart.

731
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:02,917
- Dear God!
- You're talkin' crazy, Thad. What birds?

732
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:05,116
Sparrows. Don't you hear the sparrows?

733
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:10,189
Well, whatever you're talkin' about
doesn't matter, because... this is over.

734
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,277
(hangs up)

735
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:20,359
- Clear as a bell.
- Let's check the van.

736
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:26,668
The call was made from
a payphone in Times Square.

737
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:30,992
They're checkin' to see if the voice
might have been a tape recording.

738
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,350
What, made by me?

739
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:37,350
Your calling-card number
was used to pay for the call.

740
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:41,438
Jesus. After all this, I'm still a suspect.

741
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,276
Look, I know they can't hang
last night's work on you. You were here.

742
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:49,712
- But they think you have an accomplice.
- That is the craziest thing I ever heard!

743
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,309
I wish I could say the same thing, Thad.

744
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:56,275
You gave me a description, remember?

745
01:04:56,680 --> 01:05:01,037
The witness at Donaldson's says the killer
matches that description perfectly.

746
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:03,674
You told me
he was driving a black Toronado.

747
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:08,755
The place where they found Homer's
pick-up says it was stolen off their lot.

748
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:15,274
That and the fingerprints. And you named
the victims before they were killed.

749
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:19,309
I mean, Jesus Christ, man.
What do you expect people to think?

750
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:23,229
- What do you think, Alan?
- I think some psycho's got it in for you.

751
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:25,755
Somebody clever enough
to go diggin' around...

752
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:29,316
...to find out things he could use
to make you look guilty.

753
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:31,590
It's either that or it's you, Thad.

754
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:35,110
It could be that somehow
you are behind all this.

755
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:37,959
Don't think I've written that possibility off.

756
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:40,037
Well, you'd better write it off.

757
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:43,312
Stop looking at me
and start lookin' over your shoulder.

758
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:46,671
It could be real unhealthy
for you if you don't.

759
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:06,069
- How ya doin', Mr Beaumont?
- Uh, I've been better, Rosalie.

760
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:08,430
Been better.

761
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:13,991
(phone rings)

762
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:20,191
(Rosalie) Hello?

763
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,590
It's for you, Mr Beaumont.

764
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:34,917
- Hello, George.
- (Stark) Thad. How's it hangin'?

765
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:37,310
- What do you want?
- You know the answer to that.

766
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:41,479
You figured it out, and figured right.
It's time to start a new book.

767
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:45,593
Oh, I don't think so. I'm finished with you.
George Stark is dead.

768
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:48,837
(chuckles) I'm not dead, Hoss. Not hardly.

769
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:54,194
I'm just gettin' started. You better do
what I say or I'll be comin' for ya.

770
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:57,995
You will die like no other man
on earth has ever died before.

771
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:02,310
Start another book, boy.
Go home and sharpen your pencils.

772
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:04,431
(hangs up)

773
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,070
- Any calls?
- None that matter.

774
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:25,952
I'll be over home.

775
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:39,436
(whistles)

776
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:24,156
(clears throat)

777
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:26,909
(rewinds answering machine)

778
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:31,078
(beep)

779
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:34,556
(man) Hm. Guess I'll have to
call you back, Sheriff.

780
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:40,516
(beep)

781
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:43,077
Oh, God.

782
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:45,475
Oh, Jesus, Annie. I'm sorry.

783
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:49,198
- Darlin', I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

784
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:54,713
God. I didn't realise
how jumpy I've been gettin'.

785
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:57,835
This Beaumont business.

786
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:00,751
What's he like? Beaumont.

787
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:06,039
How do you know?
How do you ever know?

788
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:37,995
I'm taking him to work. Maybe you should
send another unit out to watch the house.

789
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:54,632
Come on.
Come on, get over here. That's good.

790
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:57,671
Here. (squeezes squeaky toy)

791
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:01,071
Look, if you can't...
Look, this is your favourite toy.

792
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,271
Would you... would you guys please...

793
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:06,552
Just please be...
Would you guys please shut up?

794
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,317
I'll be a coupla hours.

795
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:48,433
- You want some coffee?
- I've got my thermos.

796
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,311
Let me in, George.

797
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,789
Come on, George.
Let me come visit for a while.

798
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,275
Let me see what the hell you're up to.

799
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,389
Come on, George. Let me in.

800
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,837
Oh, God.

801
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,672
They're real.

802
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:14,308
The sparrows are real.

803
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:18,276
(eerie twittering)

804
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:52,996
Why... do you want to write again?

805
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:05,515
Why do you say that?

806
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:15,070
Falling apart?

807
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:19,278
Falling... apart.

808
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,357
How?

809
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:25,356
How must we fall?

810
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:29,311
Tell me... why, George.

811
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:36,951
What?

812
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:59,237
Agh!

813
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:14,194
(Stark) Smarts, don't it, Thad?

814
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:18,315
Hurts like a real son of a bitch.

815
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:22,189
I sure hope you can take it, Hoss.

816
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:28,191
Now...

817
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:33,835
Take it like a man.

818
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:39,077
Oh, yeah.

819
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:55,395
Like a man.

820
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,837
Agh.

821
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:12,396
Agh.

822
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:16,431
Agh.

823
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:38,079
- Where are you going?
- Bangor.

824
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:40,919
- What's in Bangor?
- I don't know. Maybe nothing.

825
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:44,390
- It's where I had surgery as a boy.
- Here. Take these.

826
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:46,750
A disguise.

827
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:51,436
A changed man. Car key.

828
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:55,514
I hope you'll have the decency to stand
good for any repairs if it gets wounded.

829
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:58,757
- How will you get home?
- A cab, I imagine.

830
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:03,033
I'll get a receipt and present it
to you at the proper moment.

831
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:06,915
- Thanks, old friend.
- Thank you for bringing adventure.

832
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:12,029
Just for fun, see if you can find
anything in your books about sparrows.

833
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:14,356
Sparrows?

834
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,951
Sparrows...

835
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:22,748
There is something about sparrows.

836
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:12,550
(Thad) A twin?

837
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:14,679
They never told you?

838
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:17,274
No. No, they said it was a tumour.

839
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:22,230
Well... in a way, that's all it was.

840
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:26,551
Foreign matter that happened
to wind up in your head.

841
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:31,349
I don't see anything, Thad,
but if you're hearing things again...

842
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:33,994
...we'd better shoot some pictures.

843
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:37,109
A great many of us start out as twins.

844
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:40,039
At least one in ten, probably more.

845
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:45,394
The stronger fetus absorbs the weaker
and comes to birth as a single child.

846
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:50,756
In your case,
the fetus wasn't completely absorbed...

847
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:54,272
...and it had to be removed surgically.

848
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:58,389
Your mom and dad were
pretty rattled by the whole thing.

849
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:03,229
They insisted that the excised tissue
be treated as human remains...

850
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:05,351
...and signed over to them.

851
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:08,074
- They wanted to bury it.
- Bury it.

852
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:11,397
In Homeland Cemetery, in the family plot.

853
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,511
Don't know.

854
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:18,752
- They ever tell you about the sparrows?
- The sparrows?

855
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:22,350
It was the damnedest thing.
We'd just finished your surgery...

856
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:27,470
...when this enormous flock of sparrows,
thousands of them...

857
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:30,319
...came swarming down onto the hospital.

858
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:32,590
They never figured out
what the hell it was.

859
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:35,030
Some kind of migration or something.

860
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:39,677
Made a hell of a mess. Windows broke.
Three or four people got hurt.

861
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,673
You're... bleeding pretty good there.

862
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:47,549
Let me put a proper dressing on that.

863
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:52,273
- What did you say it was? A cut?
- Oh, uh...

864
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,468
No, I, uh... poked myself.

865
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,869
It'll stick in my mind for ever.

866
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:05,640
You complaining about
those bird sounds, and...

867
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:08,234
...us getting hit by those sparrows.

868
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,673
It was like we took
the sound out of your head...

869
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:13,990
...and it... came to life.

870
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:18,436
Howdy, Doc. Remember me?

871
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,116
(car horn)

872
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:25,077
Jesus!

873
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:33,275
You bastard.

874
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:34,635
Jesus.

875
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,950
(phone ringing)

876
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:43,679
- Hello?
- You gotta get out of there right now.

877
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:47,594
- Thad? What are you talk...
- He's here. Stark is here in Bangor.

878
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:50,473
That's 20 minutes away.
Get the hell out of there now.

879
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:54,229
- What are you doing in Bangor?
- Liz, please! Just listen to me.

880
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:58,353
Get out of there, all right?
There's no time. He's killed Doc Pritchard.

881
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:02,389
- He's gonna come after you and the kids.
- All right. All right, we'll go.

882
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:05,752
- No, promise me. Promise me.
- I promise you we'll go. We'll go now.

883
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:08,030
Don't pack anything. Just get the hell out.

884
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:10,151
Wait. How do I get in touch with you?

885
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,276
Through the school. Just, um...

886
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:15,711
Uh, Reggie. Don't tell her
where you're going or where you are.

887
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:19,230
Tell her you're safe. Don't tell anyone
who might tell me where you are.

888
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:21,749
I can't know. Do you understand me?

889
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:25,670
- I cannot know where you are.
- All right, we'll go.

890
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:28,797
I love you, Liz.

891
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:32,273
I love you. I love you more than anything.

892
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,949
- I love you.
- (Thad hangs up)

893
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:50,355
OK, listen.
Mommy's gonna take you on a little ride...

894
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:53,999
Shit.

895
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,514
I got a despatch. Code six.

896
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:07,949
Uh, there's been, uh...

897
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:10,989
You better call an ambulance. There's...

898
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:14,317
- Ambulance?
- Call an ambulance.

899
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:19,875
For God's sakes, we're in danger here,
Alan. My babies are in danger.

900
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:23,834
I can't let you just go runnin' off.
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't let you.

901
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:28,238
- But Stark could be out there.
- There is no George Stark, Elizabeth.

902
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:31,477
- He doesn't exist.
- Somebody exists. Thad said he saw him.

903
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:36,435
I don't give a damn what Thad said. Your
husband ought to be in the county jail...

904
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:41,151
...and I'm startin' to feel like a damn idiot
for not puttin' him there a long time ago.

905
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:43,788
You're just gonna have to
sit tight and ride this out.

906
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,276
Nothing is going to happen.
You're under police protection.

907
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:51,389
- Am I under protection, or under arrest?
- You call it what you like.

908
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:53,989
I'm sorry, Liz.
I've been way too soft on this thing.

909
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:58,034
I've gotta start goin' by the book.
Now let me talk to the officer there.

910
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:02,075
He wants to talk to you.

911
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:05,470
- Yes, sir?
- Just hold the fort there, son.

912
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:10,310
I'll have two units out to replace you
before nightfall. Keep your eyes open.

913
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:14,992
If Thad Beaumont shows up, you pull
him in on suspicion... Murder one.

914
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:17,749
Yes, sir. Got it covered, sir.

915
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:30,917
I think the absorbed fetus was merely
a vessel, a stolen body, if you like.

916
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:35,437
It just happened to be there,
wholly by accident, and Stark used it.

917
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:39,479
He took it for his own.
Stark is a conjuration...

918
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:43,673
...an entity created by
the force of your will.

919
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:48,074
We all have something
of the beast inside us.

920
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:51,272
We can either suppress it or encourage it.

921
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:54,040
In your case, you encouraged it too much.

922
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:57,038
In your subconscious,
you wanted it to live.

923
01:23:57,240 --> 01:24:00,516
You wanted it so badly,
it actually came to be.

924
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:05,115
Your characters have always
been vividly written, Thad.

925
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:08,270
I wanted him to live.

926
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:13,194
God forgive me, it's true.

927
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:16,119
A part of me has always
admired George Stark.

928
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:18,840
Admired his simple, violent nature.

929
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:23,678
A man who doesn't stumble over things,
who never looks weak or silly.

930
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:27,277
A man with a straight,
sharp answer for everything.

931
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:30,313
Yes. But he's a bastard.

932
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:32,318
Half of me is a bastard.

933
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:35,231
My dark half.

934
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:37,271
George Stark is my dark half.

935
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:40,392
Yeah, but surely you don't
want him to stay alive.

936
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:43,677
I mean, you can't still admire him
after all that he's done.

937
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:47,435
- No.
- If you don't want him, he can't remain.

938
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:52,037
You're the one with life, real life.
He's trying to take it away from you.

939
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:54,800
But if you're not willing to give it up...

940
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,116
...what can he do?

941
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:01,949
Kill you?
That would be suicide, wouldn't it?

942
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:09,275
Why didn't I see that? He can't hurt me,
so he's going after the people around me.

943
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:11,272
Exactly.

944
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:15,833
I found something in Barringer's here.

945
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:18,031
Something about sparrows.

946
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:22,559
Whippoorwills, loons and sparrows...

947
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:26,353
...are psychopomps.
- What?

948
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:30,275
From the Greek.
It means "those who conduct".

949
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:35,194
In this case,
those who conduct human souls...

950
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:40,315
...back and forth between the land
of the living and the land of the dead.

951
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:42,951
(phone rings)

952
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:49,557
Hello?

953
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:52,395
Thad! It's for you.

954
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:05,073
I'm not gonna write your book, George.
You're dead. And dead you're gonna stay!

955
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:07,953
(Stark) You're wrong, old Hoss.
You wanna get started.

956
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:13,439
Start by nightfall or you'll be a sorry
son of a bitch. You won't be the only one.

957
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:17,673
See if you can figure out where
I'm callin' from, Thad. (toy squeaks)

958
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:19,671
(hangs up)

959
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:21,990
No!

960
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:29,239
- That was quick, Hoss.
- What have you done to them?

961
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:31,317
Not a thing... yet. Not to your people.

962
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:34,990
I had to do a few things to that
state trooper watchin' your house.

963
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:38,237
What's left of him is out
in his bubble-mobile drawin' flies.

964
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:41,273
- Let me talk to Liz.
- No time. Gotta go, buddy-roo.

965
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:45,553
Me and the family, we gotta ride. I think
you know where we're all be headin'.

966
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:47,671
Endsville, Thad.

967
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:50,912
That place where
all rail service terminates.

968
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:55,039
Oh. In case you're wonderin',
I cut the tracer on your phone here.

969
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:58,710
I figure this is private business,
just between you and me.

970
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:01,036
(hangs up)

971
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:08,357
The trace...

972
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:13,314
Jesus, the phone trace. They heard
my call, they wouldn't let her go.

973
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:17,433
He's got Liz, Reggie. He's got my children.

974
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:22,276
Be careful. Remember, he knows as
much about you as you know about him.

975
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:25,040
Don't let him seduce you. Don't...

976
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:34,918
They've come to take one of us away,
haven't they?

977
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:37,790
- Which one?
- The loser, of course.

978
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:40,874
I do hope it's not you, Thaddeus.

979
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:45,437
I'd hate to think of George Stark
taking over your lecture group.

980
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:48,831
- (Thad) Why isn't he aware of them?
- I don't know.

981
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:52,316
- Let's take it as a good sign.
- I thought you knew about this shit.

982
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:57,150
I don't know about any of it.
Nobody does, except the Almighty, and...

983
01:27:57,320 --> 01:27:59,515
...he seems to be on sabbatical.

984
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:03,834
In the end, it's what you believe.

985
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:06,793
I wish I had a talisman to give you,
or a silver bullet...

986
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,309
...or a stake to drive
through the monster's heart.

987
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:12,478
- But it's not that simple.
- You've given me all I need.

988
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:14,796
Thanks, Reggie.

989
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:20,556
Good luck. It'll be interesting to see
who's sitting in your office next week.

990
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:24,435
- I'll be there.
- Wear a red carnation so I know it's you.

991
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:44,799
I got a dead officer. I call that trouble.
We're pretty sure that Beaumont did it.

992
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,309
- (Alan) Why's that?
- Well, he's outta here.

993
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:50,353
He apparently took his family with him,
unless he cut them up.

994
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:54,269
He killed that doctor in Bangor.
We got a positive ID from the receptionist.

995
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:56,710
If he's heading to his place up there...

996
01:28:56,920 --> 01:29:00,754
...it would be real nice if you
were there to stop his fucking clock.

997
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:03,076
You got it. Fine.

998
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:22,349
Come on.

999
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:25,958
Oh, shit.

1000
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:28,037
(sirens)

1001
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:32,155
Just keep on goin'.

1002
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:34,356
Keep on goin'.

1003
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:07,230
Me and Thad, we're gonna be doin' some
collaboratin', just like we always done.

1004
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:10,034
When it's over,
if you haven't pissed me off too bad...

1005
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:12,800
...I might just decide to let you go.

1006
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:17,358
But you understand,
it all depends on what kinda mood I'm in.

1007
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:20,956
If I'm in a good mood, a peaceful mood...

1008
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:23,435
...who knows what kinda turn
things might take?

1009
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:26,273
When all this is over I might
settle down up this way...

1010
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:29,756
...and I sure would want you
to think kindly of me.

1011
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:32,749
I like it here. I purely do.

1012
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:37,233
Yeah, I could get real comfortable here.

1013
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:42,909
(chuckles)

1014
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:45,514
Dream on, motherfucker.

1015
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:53,989
This is no dream, Beth.

1016
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:01,316
Thad owes me.

1017
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:04,318
Maybe he knew how to write
before I showed up...

1018
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:07,193
...but I taught him to write
stuff people wanna read.

1019
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:11,473
Ain't no good writin' a thing
if people don't wanna read it.

1020
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:14,035
That's why I says Thad owes me.

1021
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:17,432
So you come after me,
you come after my children.

1022
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:21,075
You're a coward.

1023
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:26,471
You would do better
not to say things like that.

1024
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:34,788
Hell, I didn't want any of this trouble.

1025
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:39,070
Believe it or not,
I prefer to steer south of trouble.

1026
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:41,748
This writin' we gotta do,
I tried to do it by myself.

1027
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:44,155
It was comin' along good, too.

1028
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:46,515
Well, then I developed this, uh...

1029
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:54,516
...physical problem.

1030
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:56,756
I guess you noticed.

1031
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:59,474
Well, don't worry. I'll be better soon.

1032
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:04,151
Thad's gonna make me well.

1033
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:09,633
All's he got to do is write this one last
story and I'll be rockin' and rollin' again.

1034
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:12,758
Now, of course,
he might start feelin' poorly...

1035
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:15,758
...and workin' so... close together and all...

1036
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:19,270
...he might just go and catch
whatever this is that I got.

1037
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:23,837
That'd be a shame. I don't wish
the boy any harm, truly I don't.

1038
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:25,951
I hope it turns out different.

1039
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:30,711
But I got the feelin' that one or the other
of us is gonna have to fold his hand.

1040
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:34,949
And when it comes down to that
it's better him than me.

1041
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:38,271
My God.

1042
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:44,996
- Oh, my God, you really are...
- You're disturbin' my peaceful mood.

1043
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:50,630
You are disturbin'
the peaceful frame of mind I'm in.

1044
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:55,309
You are disturbin'
my peaceful frame of mind.

1045
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:04,276
(Elvis Presley)
I wonder if... you're lonesome tonight.

1046
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:09,758
You know, someone said that the world's
a stage, and each of us must play a part.

1047
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:14,790
- Fate had me playing in love...
- Liz.

1048
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:18,755
Oh, God, Liz. Are you all right?

1049
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:21,520
Huh? Are you OK?
The kids. Where are the kids?

1050
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:23,915
Right here, Hoss.

1051
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:28,471
(switches music off)

1052
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:31,992
Hello, Thad. How are you, old buddy?

1053
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:36,435
- You look a little peaky.
- You don't look so hot yourself.

1054
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:41,276
(Stark chuckles)

1055
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:48,034
Lf... I do what you want me to do...

1056
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,989
...you promise not to hurt them.

1057
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:56,550
If I do what you want...

1058
01:34:57,600 --> 01:34:59,955
...will you leave them alone?

1059
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:02,310
I will. I promise.

1060
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:06,115
You have my word,
the word of a Southern man...

1061
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:08,515
...which is not given lightly.

1062
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:12,911
- Let me have them.
- You can have one.

1063
01:35:40,680 --> 01:35:44,434
Liz, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry for all this.

1064
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:50,796
- I'm gonna go upstairs with him.
- No. Thad, you can't.

1065
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:53,275
We don't have a choice.

1066
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:58,269
He can't hurt me. He won't. But he
can hurt you if you give him a reason.

1067
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:03,793
Don't be thinkin' about breakin' loose,
don't be thinkin' about the telephone...

1068
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:08,953
Guess we're on the same wavelength.
Ain't that right, Thad?

1069
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:13,313
Don't you see what's happening?
Just look at him.

1070
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:15,590
He doesn't want help writing a book.

1071
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:19,076
He wants to take over your life.
Can't you see that?

1072
01:36:19,720 --> 01:36:21,995
I know what he wants.

1073
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:28,233
What I don't know and what he doesn't
know is whether this'll really save him.

1074
01:36:28,440 --> 01:36:32,228
I don't think it will save him.
I think he's finished.

1075
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:34,715
You know why?

1076
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:38,153
Cos I don't want him around any more.

1077
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:41,835
There's only one way to find out
who's finished and who's not.

1078
01:36:42,040 --> 01:36:44,429
Ain't that right, Thad?

1079
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:50,271
Are you ready?

1080
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:52,675
Just waitin' on you.

1081
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:20,357
Yeah...

1082
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:54,316
(fluttering)

1083
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:19,158
(Thad) I'll start with Machine
stealing the police car.

1084
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:20,799
Yes, that's right.

1085
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:56,596
(fluttering)

1086
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:10,593
- Give me a cigarette.
- I thought you quit.

1087
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:12,438
I did.

1088
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:17,988
Except for times like this.

1089
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:27,633
Times when me and you
are workin' together.

1090
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:09,796
(fluttering)

1091
01:40:15,320 --> 01:40:15,832
Thad.

1092
01:40:28,840 --> 01:40:30,876
Why don't you try, George?

1093
01:40:31,080 --> 01:40:33,435
You gotta break in.

1094
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:52,951
I'm scared, Hoss.

1095
01:40:53,160 --> 01:40:56,072
Oh, you know the only way to do it...

1096
01:40:56,280 --> 01:40:58,430
...is to do it.

1097
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:46,277
(mutters)

1098
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:50,276
(fluttering)

1099
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:53,317
(Stark chuckles)

1100
01:41:55,080 --> 01:41:57,275
(frenzied twittering)

1101
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:05,429
(glass shatters)

1102
01:43:07,320 --> 01:43:09,595
It's comin', Thad.

1103
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:13,517
It's comin' easy, it's comin' good.

1104
01:43:14,440 --> 01:43:17,352
I can do it. I can do it.

1105
01:43:20,760 --> 01:43:23,399
You shouldn't fuck with me, Hoss.

1106
01:43:25,160 --> 01:43:27,958
Don't you know I can tell
what you're thinkin'?

1107
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:31,995
Stop it, Thad.
Stop it, or I'm gonna have to cut ya.

1108
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:36,470
You're not gonna cut me, George.
You can't do shit to me and you know it.

1109
01:43:36,680 --> 01:43:39,274
I can do some shit
to the other folks around here.

1110
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:42,399
Yes, sir,
I can do some real ugly shit to them.

1111
01:43:43,480 --> 01:43:45,357
Sit down, Thad.

1112
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:47,596
Make it easy on yourself.

1113
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:51,278
Sit down and... shut your eyes.

1114
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:54,315
See if you can't just...

1115
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:58,310
...drift on off.

1116
01:43:58,520 --> 01:44:00,272
You go to hell.

1117
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:40,750
(fluttering)

1118
01:45:48,360 --> 01:45:50,828
They've come to take you away, George.

1119
01:45:51,040 --> 01:45:53,429
Take you back to the devil.

1120
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:57,077
(child gurgles)

1121
01:46:13,240 --> 01:46:15,151
(Liz) Thad?

1122
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:17,671
Thad!

1123
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:20,957
OK. You sit here.
I gotta open the door now.

1124
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:39,914
I didn't want it to be like this, Hoss.

1125
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:44,754
I had a different sort of thing in mind.

1126
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,513
Yes, I did.

1127
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:58,512
They've come to write the ending, George.

1128
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:03,549
Is it gonna be your ending... or mine?

1129
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:05,671
(thudding)

1130
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,389
Kinda clumsy there, George.

1131
01:47:30,280 --> 01:47:34,956
I'm gonna... I'm gonna give you...
one last chance here, Thad.

1132
01:47:36,280 --> 01:47:38,396
Stop whatever it is that you're doin' here.

1133
01:47:38,600 --> 01:47:40,909
I'm not doin' anything, Hoss.

1134
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:45,115
I'm just waitin' around
to see how things turn out.

1135
01:47:52,600 --> 01:47:55,194
Stop it, Thad. Stop it.

1136
01:47:55,400 --> 01:47:58,392
I'm sorry, George. I can't.

1137
01:48:01,080 --> 01:48:03,275
Neither can you.

1138
01:48:05,480 --> 01:48:07,835
The ending, huh?

1139
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:13,150
Well, let's see how you like this ending,
Hoss.

1140
01:48:20,600 --> 01:48:22,716
No!

1141
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:25,115
(gun fires)

1142
01:48:25,320 --> 01:48:27,276
(creaking)

1143
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:44,276
(screams)

1144
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:04,634
Alan!

1145
01:49:09,480 --> 01:49:11,869
Hurry up!

1146
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:15,390
- What the hell's goin' on? What is this?
- They're upstairs.

1147
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:17,158
- Who?
- He took them upstairs.

1148
01:49:17,320 --> 01:49:19,754
- Where's Thad?
- He's upstairs. He's with Stark.

1149
01:49:19,960 --> 01:49:22,315
- Hold still!
- He's got the kids upstairs.

1150
01:49:22,520 --> 01:49:24,192
Liz, no! No!

1151
01:49:51,080 --> 01:49:53,230
Wait! Wait here!

1152
01:50:05,360 --> 01:50:07,510
(Stark screaming)

1153
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:44,311
Liz.
