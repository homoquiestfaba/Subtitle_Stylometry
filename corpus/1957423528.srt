175
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:23,959
Kids, close your eyes.

176
00:08:24,094 --> 00:08:26,329
Dad is not doing anything.
Close those eyes.

177
00:08:32,069 --> 00:08:34,238
Dad is not texting.

178
00:08:55,258 --> 00:08:56,125
Hey.

179
00:08:56,658 --> 00:08:58,127
Happy birthday.

180
00:09:03,032 --> 00:09:03,899
Yeah.

181
00:09:04,367 --> 00:09:06,136
Called in a sitter
for this place?

182
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,438
Don't worry.
Don't worry. I got you.

183
00:09:08,838 --> 00:09:09,738
Beautiful light.

184
00:09:09,873 --> 00:09:11,307
Wow.

185
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:16,180
Ah, thank you so much. Wow.

186
00:09:17,013 --> 00:09:18,081
- Good?
- Yep.

187
00:09:18,482 --> 00:09:20,550
- All right. Deal closed?
- Uh, no.

188
00:09:22,453 --> 00:09:24,054
You said the deal
was gonna be closed

189
00:09:24,186 --> 00:09:25,855
- on the first of the
month, It's the first

190
00:09:25,989 --> 00:09:27,257
of the month. Yeah.
That was the plan.

191
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,958
Until two billionaires
with egos the

192
00:09:29,092 --> 00:09:30,493
size of Mount
Kiliman-fucking-jaro

193
00:09:30,627 --> 00:09:32,896
decided to put a pause
on a $46 million deal

194
00:09:33,028 --> 00:09:34,630
over two trees
that were left off,

195
00:09:34,765 --> 00:09:36,166
mistakenly, on the survey.

196
00:09:41,905 --> 00:09:43,274
Choo-choo.

197
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:47,911
[Giggles] Thank you.

198
00:09:48,978 --> 00:09:50,147
[Pam sighs]

199
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,450
- How are the boys?
- Ah, well,

200
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,517
since the last time
you saw them. Let's see.

201
00:09:55,651 --> 00:09:56,987
MacGuire started shaving

202
00:09:57,119 --> 00:09:58,788
and the toddler
joined the Merchant Marines, so.

203
00:09:58,921 --> 00:10:02,224
No, they're good. I read them,
bathed them, fed them.

204
00:10:02,358 --> 00:10:03,692
Uh. Hey.

205
00:10:03,826 --> 00:10:06,695
Sitter came early. Said we could
stay out as late as we want.

206
00:10:06,829 --> 00:10:08,631
Haha, I wish.

207
00:10:09,199 --> 00:10:10,800
I mean,
this deal is, like, next level.

208
00:10:10,934 --> 00:10:14,070
My year-end bonus means
that we can finally put a dent

209
00:10:14,204 --> 00:10:15,405
in paying off law school,

210
00:10:15,537 --> 00:10:17,606
start the 529
for the kids' college.

211
00:10:17,741 --> 00:10:20,677
I mean, the kids are, like,
eight years old combined.

212
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:23,479
We should've started
when they were born, Mike.

213
00:10:23,979 --> 00:10:25,281
All right. Look, babe.

214
00:10:26,516 --> 00:10:29,353
I don't understand
anything that you do,

215
00:10:30,054 --> 00:10:32,689
but I get why you do it.
And, honey, I...

216
00:10:33,156 --> 00:10:35,558
I see you, I believe in you.

217
00:10:35,691 --> 00:10:36,592
and I...

218
00:10:38,127 --> 00:10:39,628
Got to answer that text?

219
00:10:39,762 --> 00:10:41,196
Sorry. I just...

220
00:10:41,497 --> 00:10:44,233
don't get a whole lot of
real life adult interaction.

221
00:10:44,367 --> 00:10:47,136
And yet, here we are,
in real life.

222
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,540
Two adults, interacting.

223
00:10:51,842 --> 00:10:53,243
[Pam] Listen. I was thinking.

224
00:10:53,377 --> 00:10:55,746
When the deal closes,
which it will,

225
00:10:56,412 --> 00:10:58,614
what if, you and I,

226
00:10:59,147 --> 00:11:00,082
take a trip?

227
00:11:00,215 --> 00:11:01,584
Just the two of us, no kids.

228
00:11:02,485 --> 00:11:04,987
Couple days
on the Bourbon Trail.

229
00:11:05,321 --> 00:11:06,489
That sounds...

230
00:11:10,526 --> 00:11:11,461
[snorts]

231
00:11:13,129 --> 00:11:14,230
[scoffs]

232
00:11:14,797 --> 00:11:16,031
Busy day?

233
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,733
They wanted to wish you
a happy birthday.

234
00:11:17,867 --> 00:11:19,370
Oh, yeah, I'm sure they do.

235
00:11:20,704 --> 00:11:21,738
Oh.

236
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:24,406
This is work.

237
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:25,441
Mmm-hm.

238
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,612
Okay. I, uh, I'm starving.

239
00:11:28,746 --> 00:11:31,548
Please order me something.
I'm gonna go powder my nose.

240
00:11:31,681 --> 00:11:33,550
- Okay. What would you like?
- Oh, God.

241
00:11:33,682 --> 00:11:35,752
I can't make
another decision today. Um.

242
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,521
No chicken, no beef.

243
00:11:37,653 --> 00:11:40,023
Uh, nothing too starchy.
No dairy.

244
00:11:40,156 --> 00:11:42,258
Just veggies,
but not drowning in sauce.

245
00:11:42,392 --> 00:11:44,661
Okay, so basically air,
medium-rare.

246
00:11:44,795 --> 00:11:46,363
- You got me.
- Got it.

247
00:11:48,097 --> 00:11:49,233
[phone vibrating]

248
00:11:50,233 --> 00:11:51,635
Where are you?

249
00:11:51,767 --> 00:11:53,737
We're gonna order
when she gets back. Thank you.

250
00:11:53,871 --> 00:11:55,372
<i>Don't you dare eat.</i>

251
00:11:55,738 --> 00:11:58,307
My taco guy has been cooking
for, like, <i>tres</i> fucking <i>días.</i>

252
00:11:58,441 --> 00:12:00,442
Karen, the deal didn't close.

253
00:12:00,576 --> 00:12:02,678
She promised the deal
would be closed today,

254
00:12:02,813 --> 00:12:05,615
and it didn't. She has to work
all night. We are fucked!

255
00:12:05,748 --> 00:12:08,651
Oh, no, no, no, buddy.
This party has already set sail.

256
00:12:08,785 --> 00:12:11,054
The only thing you need to do
is get her in that dress.

257
00:12:11,186 --> 00:12:12,854
Well, how exactly do I do that?

258
00:12:12,988 --> 00:12:14,523
I don't know, Mike.

259
00:12:14,858 --> 00:12:17,260
Maybe convince her
it's something kinky.

260
00:12:17,627 --> 00:12:18,594
Get here.

261
00:12:18,994 --> 00:12:21,764
[Pam] Richard, I peed
in my office for you. Okay?

262
00:12:21,898 --> 00:12:23,767
[Richard] <i>I was on the phone
with you all day long,</i>

263
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,235
<i>I realized I never
wished you happy birthday.</i>

264
00:12:26,368 --> 00:12:27,903
- Thank you.
- <i>Now, that's said.</i>

265
00:12:28,037 --> 00:12:32,776
<i>But while I have you, what if e
buy the seller's stock?</i>

266
00:12:32,908 --> 00:12:33,776
Wait.

267
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,245
Repaper on a Saturday?

268
00:12:35,978 --> 00:12:38,681
Wait. You want me
to recreate 150 pages

269
00:12:38,815 --> 00:12:41,218
so you can assume
the guy's debt?

270
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,351
<i>Is that bad?</i>

271
00:12:42,485 --> 00:12:44,620
Yes, yes, it's very bad.

272
00:12:45,321 --> 00:12:47,222
Okay, look. I'm gonna go eat.

273
00:12:47,589 --> 00:12:49,759
I'll call you in an hour. Okay?

274
00:12:49,892 --> 00:12:53,629
- <i>I want to stop, but we...</i>
- Okay, I'm hanging up now.

275
00:12:54,998 --> 00:12:57,267
- Hey.
- Aw, thanks.

276
00:12:58,502 --> 00:12:59,669
What are you doing?

277
00:12:59,802 --> 00:13:01,570
I'd like to open my gift
with dessert,

278
00:13:01,704 --> 00:13:04,373
- if you don't mind.
- Actually, I kind of do mind.

279
00:13:04,507 --> 00:13:05,742
Well, I'm starving.

280
00:13:05,876 --> 00:13:07,578
Please. It would really
mean a lot to me.

281
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:09,613
Okay.

282
00:13:16,118 --> 00:13:17,552
Is that my prom dress?

283
00:13:17,686 --> 00:13:19,955
Nope,
it's your homecoming dress.

284
00:13:20,256 --> 00:13:21,592
Uh, I'm confused.

285
00:13:21,724 --> 00:13:23,859
Well, your mom had to throw away
your prom dress

286
00:13:23,993 --> 00:13:26,128
because of the slab lake.
You know it got moldy.

287
00:13:26,262 --> 00:13:27,830
No, no, I'm confused
why you're giving

288
00:13:27,964 --> 00:13:29,699
me my homecoming
dress on my birthday.

289
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,834
Oh, don't worry.
I got is resized.

290
00:13:31,968 --> 00:13:34,103
Oh, cool. Thank for
clarifying that necessity.

291
00:13:34,237 --> 00:13:35,938
And why? Why did we resize this?

292
00:13:36,071 --> 00:13:37,573
Oh, because I think

293
00:13:37,706 --> 00:13:39,742
you were the sexiest
homecoming queen I ever saw

294
00:13:39,876 --> 00:13:42,978
and I wanna make love to you
tonight in it again.

295
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:45,248
Oh, okay. Wow.

296
00:13:45,949 --> 00:13:46,849
I knew it.

297
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,918
You're having a mid-life crisis

298
00:13:50,552 --> 00:13:53,288
I wouldn't exactly call it
a crisis, but come on.

299
00:13:53,422 --> 00:13:55,392
Why don't you just
get in there and...

300
00:13:56,026 --> 00:13:56,926
put it on.

301
00:14:00,162 --> 00:14:01,264
Are you having a stroke?

302
00:14:01,397 --> 00:14:02,699
What? No.

303
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:04,132
Pam.

304
00:14:04,968 --> 00:14:07,203
Go back to the bathroom
and put on that dress.

305
00:14:07,336 --> 00:14:09,638
No, you go to the bathroom
and put on the frickin' dress.

306
00:14:09,772 --> 00:14:11,907
Come on, what's more fun
than a little role playing?

307
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,643
Oh, my God. If this is
some Fifty Shades thing,

308
00:14:14,777 --> 00:14:17,479
you know, you know
that that is not my jam.

309
00:14:17,814 --> 00:14:18,714
[sighs]

310
00:14:19,815 --> 00:14:21,218
Uh.
Just the cheque, please.

311
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,985
I thought you ordered.
I'm starving.

312
00:14:23,118 --> 00:14:25,488
Just the cheque. Thank you.

313
00:14:26,122 --> 00:14:27,022
Mike.

314
00:14:27,455 --> 00:14:28,624
What is happening?

315
00:14:28,757 --> 00:14:31,195
You are freaking me out
right now.

316
00:14:33,463 --> 00:14:35,933
All of our friends,
and I mean all of them,

317
00:14:36,065 --> 00:14:37,733
are around the corner
at a banquet hall,

318
00:14:37,868 --> 00:14:40,103
waiting for you
to arrive in this dress.

319
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:41,838
Karen and I,
under the impression

320
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:43,539
that your deal would
be done today, the today

321
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,075
you promised
it would be done by,

322
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:47,577
decided to throw you
a surprise '80s prom party.

323
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,546
I thought
it was just you and me tonight.

324
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:51,781
I specifically said,
please, whatever you do...

325
00:14:51,915 --> 00:14:54,284
Pam, don't say it,
it's too late.

326
00:14:55,786 --> 00:14:57,853
I just, I just wanna go home.

327
00:14:57,987 --> 00:15:01,391
I wanna eat, go home,
make sexy time, and work.

328
00:15:01,523 --> 00:15:03,192
Do you not
wanna make sexy time with me?

329
00:15:03,326 --> 00:15:05,728
Of course
I wanna make sexy time with you.

330
00:15:05,862 --> 00:15:06,896
After the party.

331
00:15:07,229 --> 00:15:08,797
- Michael.
- Pamela.

332
00:15:08,931 --> 00:15:11,267
- Mike.
- Pam.

333
00:15:15,537 --> 00:15:17,840
- Can I at least get other shoes?
- We don't have time.

334
00:15:17,974 --> 00:15:21,210
I look like I'm going to, like,
a pilgrim prom.

335
00:15:21,344 --> 00:15:22,478
[Mike] You look great.

336
00:15:24,414 --> 00:15:25,949
[door buzzing]

337
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:29,953
Shut your pie holes!
They're here!

338
00:15:33,289 --> 00:15:34,458
[man] I got this!

339
00:15:35,757 --> 00:15:38,461
Evening, folks.
Welcome to the Polish American

340
00:15:38,594 --> 00:15:39,995
- Veteran Society.
- Thank you.

341
00:15:40,128 --> 00:15:43,300
- Oh, God. What are you doing?
- All right. Okay.

342
00:15:47,235 --> 00:15:48,603
What is happening?

343
00:15:49,939 --> 00:15:53,309
Oh, looks like Tom Cruise
is ready to have a good time.

344
00:15:53,441 --> 00:15:54,543
There we go.

345
00:15:56,378 --> 00:15:58,981
Dam-din-de-de-de-de.

346
00:16:09,092 --> 00:16:10,359
Surprise!

347
00:16:10,493 --> 00:16:12,762
[Karen] Happy

Look at Pam!

349
00:16:15,464 --> 00:16:18,500
Wow. What a surprise.

350
00:16:18,633 --> 00:16:20,369
And what is this?

351
00:16:20,502 --> 00:16:24,440
Bitch, I am finally
Jake Ryan's girlfriend.

352
00:16:24,574 --> 00:16:26,675
Just cut it. Okay.
Say your shaloms

353
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:27,911
and then
I'm dragging you

354
00:16:28,044 --> 00:16:29,646
to the bathroom
to fix your face.

355
00:16:29,778 --> 00:16:32,915
Not that there's anything
wrong with it. Much. Move!

356
00:16:34,217 --> 00:16:35,118
Happy birthday.

359
00:16:40,323 --> 00:16:42,092
Hi, Elvis. P-shhh.

360

[Pam] Thank you.

364
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,269
Oh, my God,
you invited your parents.

365

[Mrs. Young] You look lovely,
dear.

366

- Of course.

I meant one for money.

396
00:18:02,805 --> 00:18:05,641
You know, most people think
Nirvana was a '90s band,

397
00:18:05,775 --> 00:18:08,277
but they actually
made <i>Bleach</i> in '89.

398
00:18:08,411 --> 00:18:10,046
- Oh.
- Personally, I'm more

And he dove

She must look different.

438

No, she looked pretty bow-house
back then, too.

439
00:20:00,524 --> 00:20:02,659
- [Janie] I can confirm that.
- Oh.

- 'Sup, whore?

Did you have anything to do
with planning this nightmare?

Um, my loathing for you
runs deep, big sis,

443
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,602
but not deep enough
to throw you a surprise party.

No, it's like Tinder,
but for big and tall people.

In his defense. He thought
your deal would close today.

I think you're pretty great.

528
00:23:35,171 --> 00:23:37,073
Sergeant Sylvester, is it?

529
00:23:37,206 --> 00:23:39,242
Folks around here call me Sarge.

530
00:23:39,374 --> 00:23:40,442
Sarge.

531
00:23:40,576 --> 00:23:42,978
Listen, so what if at midnight

532
00:23:43,112 --> 00:23:45,648
this party is still, you know,
[giggles]

533
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,115
popping off?

534
00:23:47,482 --> 00:23:48,383
Toots.

535
00:23:49,017 --> 00:23:51,653
I was gay before FDR
was on the dime.

536
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,757
Work your magic
on a straight sucker.

537
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:57,259
You got till midnight!

00:24:46,808 --> 00:24:48,277

[cheering]

558
00:25:08,863 --> 00:25:10,033
Fuck me.

559
00:25:11,566 --> 00:25:12,468
Punks.

560
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,042
Nerds.

561
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,662
Who are these people?

562
00:25:40,796 --> 00:25:43,065
I told Mike to make
the Facebook invite private.

563
00:25:43,632 --> 00:25:45,767
Wait, this is a public event
on Facebook?

564
00:25:45,901 --> 00:25:47,804
- What is the difference?
- I don't know,

565
00:25:47,937 --> 00:25:50,272
117 strangers
at my birthday party.

566
00:25:50,404 --> 00:25:53,441
- Plus, I'm not even on Facebook.
- These aren't strangers.

567
00:25:53,575 --> 00:25:56,679
We went to Hight School
with these people. I think.

568
00:25:57,412 --> 00:25:59,914
[Pam] Okay, so is this
a birthday party

569
00:26:00,048 --> 00:26:00,915
or a reunion?

570
00:26:01,049 --> 00:26:03,219
Just for clarification.

571
00:26:03,619 --> 00:26:04,988
- Hi, Janie.
- Doug.

572
00:26:06,721 --> 00:26:07,824
Hello.

573
00:26:07,957 --> 00:26:09,892
- Never gonna happen, Doug.
- Oh.

574
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,995
A boy can dream, can't he?

575
00:26:12,128 --> 00:26:14,196
As long as that dream
includes mouthwash

576
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:16,231
and ample personal space.

577
00:26:16,565 --> 00:26:17,533
Oh!

578
00:26:17,967 --> 00:26:19,200
Thank you.

579
00:26:19,601 --> 00:26:20,969
Ooh. Sick burn.

580
00:26:22,037 --> 00:26:23,472
What's up with the book ends?

581
00:26:24,507 --> 00:26:27,543
No need to whisper, my friend.
They don't speak English.

582
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,011
None?

583
00:26:29,311 --> 00:26:31,080
None. Watch this.

584
00:26:31,846 --> 00:26:32,981
Bananas.

585
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:36,052
Nothing.

586
00:26:37,052 --> 00:26:38,821
So, are you, uh,

587
00:26:38,953 --> 00:26:39,888
teaching French?

588
00:26:40,021 --> 00:26:43,191
No, I retired after the 2KY.

589
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,961
You mean, Y2K?

590
00:26:46,094 --> 00:26:47,497
It was a bust, I know.

591
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:50,033
My partner at the time,
he was, how do you say?

592
00:26:50,165 --> 00:26:51,366
Two polar.

593
00:26:52,167 --> 00:26:55,103
- It's bipolar.
- Yes.

594
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:56,505
Very confused.

595
00:26:56,639 --> 00:26:59,575
He convinced me
to move into the woods.

596
00:27:00,375 --> 00:27:03,478
We lived off the land
and had our own fecal compost

597
00:27:03,612 --> 00:27:04,613
for three years.

598
00:27:04,747 --> 00:27:07,150
Until he contracted
Lyme Disease.

599
00:27:09,852 --> 00:27:11,120
Where'd you find them?

600
00:27:11,253 --> 00:27:12,554
[man] They showed up
at my seminar in Prague.

601
00:27:12,688 --> 00:27:15,123
They're marginally famous
contortionists,

602
00:27:15,257 --> 00:27:16,924
but they're looking
to grow their portfolio

603
00:27:17,058 --> 00:27:17,959
of appreciating assets.

604
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:19,628
Just like the rest of us.

605
00:27:20,062 --> 00:27:21,997
So, they tie themselves
in knots?

606
00:27:22,463 --> 00:27:25,167
They can work themselves
into any sort of kink.

607
00:27:26,535 --> 00:27:27,704
I bet they can.

608
00:27:28,703 --> 00:27:29,871
You know, um...

609
00:27:30,439 --> 00:27:34,110
You're the only teacher to ever
give me a C in High School.

610
00:27:35,143 --> 00:27:36,511
Did you deserve it?

611
00:27:38,046 --> 00:27:38,948
I mean...

612
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:41,083
I didn't think so at the time.

613
00:27:41,417 --> 00:27:42,785
I drank a lot then.

614
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:45,321
I was eager to feel something.

615
00:27:45,988 --> 00:27:48,357
Your disappointment fed me.

616
00:27:48,924 --> 00:27:50,292
Kept me alive.

617
00:27:52,326 --> 00:27:54,063
- Mike. Long time.
- Yeah.

618
00:27:54,196 --> 00:27:55,197
How are you?

619
00:27:55,331 --> 00:27:56,498
I'm good. I'm good.

620
00:27:56,632 --> 00:27:58,467
Hey, whatever happened
to baseball?

621
00:27:58,601 --> 00:28:01,303
- I thought I'd seen you on TV.
- Yep. That was the plan.

622
00:28:01,437 --> 00:28:03,205
Then I tore my UCL
right up the ball

623
00:28:03,338 --> 00:28:04,772
and frayed my shoulder.

624
00:28:04,907 --> 00:28:06,309
- Did a little triple A...
- Bummer, That's a bummer

625
00:28:06,441 --> 00:28:08,009
- ...got a little TV time.
- But Hey.

626
00:28:08,143 --> 00:28:10,445
It's a kids' game anyway, right?
All right.

627
00:28:14,783 --> 00:28:15,685
Dick.

628
00:28:22,324 --> 00:28:23,426
[whispers] Boo.

629
00:28:24,058 --> 00:28:26,661
Oh. [laughs] Hi.

630
00:28:30,431 --> 00:28:33,102
You know, I was just thinking
about that Algebra II.

631
00:28:33,802 --> 00:28:36,539
Trig? The final we stayed up
all night for?

632
00:28:36,939 --> 00:28:40,243
Oh. We had Algebra II together?

633
00:28:40,843 --> 00:28:41,744
Yeah.

634
00:28:43,746 --> 00:28:45,381
Yeah. You and your dog.

635
00:28:46,014 --> 00:28:47,416
What was his name?

636
00:28:47,783 --> 00:28:48,684
Sting?

637
00:28:50,419 --> 00:28:53,122
- You remember my dog?
- Of course.

638
00:28:54,989 --> 00:28:56,425
He ate all our pizza.

639
00:28:58,126 --> 00:28:59,827
Threw it up
all over your pillow.

640
00:29:00,194 --> 00:29:01,296
Okay?

641
00:29:02,597 --> 00:29:03,498
Wow.

642
00:29:03,999 --> 00:29:06,734
You have, like, a complete...

643
00:29:07,469 --> 00:29:09,705
memory, filled with so much.

644
00:29:10,372 --> 00:29:11,641
I had to, um...

645
00:29:12,473 --> 00:29:14,976
defrag the old hard drives

646
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,445
for the bar exam.

647
00:29:16,577 --> 00:29:19,815
You know.
So that's probably why...

648

University of Chicago.

649
00:29:23,117 --> 00:29:24,019
Oh!

650
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:26,254
- You went there too.
- No.

651
00:29:26,988 --> 00:29:28,091
Oh.

652
00:29:28,924 --> 00:29:30,559
That's where you studied law.

653
00:29:30,692 --> 00:29:32,627
I... I did.

654
00:29:32,961 --> 00:29:34,229
How did you...

655
00:29:35,096 --> 00:29:36,598
I've kept tabs on you.

656
00:29:38,165 --> 00:29:39,469
You know, since...

657
00:29:40,334 --> 00:29:41,437
that night.

658
00:29:44,873 --> 00:29:45,775
[whispers] Okay.

659
00:29:48,142 --> 00:29:49,711
It was so good seeing you.

660
00:29:51,145 --> 00:29:52,248
Okay.

661
00:29:56,017 --> 00:29:57,120
Love you too.

662
00:29:57,687 --> 00:29:58,554
...years ago.

663
00:29:59,086 --> 00:29:59,988
Michael, hi, hi.

664
00:30:00,122 --> 00:30:01,256
- Hey.
- Can I, uh,

665
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:03,092
- talk to you for a second?
- Sure.

666
00:30:03,225 --> 00:30:04,827
- Like, anywhere but here.
- Oh.

667
00:30:06,728 --> 00:30:09,597
Hey, let's do this real quick.
Come on. Let's take a picture.

668
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:11,565
It'll be so fun.
Here, turn around.

669
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,369
Push out your belly.
We're gonna do pregnant prom.

670
00:30:15,069 --> 00:30:18,440
My only A is in Wood Shop,
and I'm gonna be a dad!

671
00:30:18,908 --> 00:30:20,809
Jeez,
You're really committed to this.

672
00:30:20,942 --> 00:30:22,377
Come on, isn't this fun?

673
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,312
Actually, no, I'm on verge
of like a panic attack.

674
00:30:24,446 --> 00:30:26,382
- What? Why?
- I'm pretty sure that the uh...

675
00:30:26,516 --> 00:30:29,051
the woman over there that
looks like Sally Scissorhands...

676
00:30:29,183 --> 00:30:30,485
Shannon Klissanon?

677
00:30:30,619 --> 00:30:32,020
Yeah uh, I'm pretty
sure she's the stalker

678
00:30:32,153 --> 00:30:33,454
I never knew I had.

679
00:30:33,587 --> 00:30:35,423
I'm sure she's just excited
to reconnect.

680
00:30:35,557 --> 00:30:37,092
By reconnect you mean go full

681
00:30:37,226 --> 00:30:39,495
Single White Female on me
before I've even cut the cake?

682
00:30:39,628 --> 00:30:41,730
Oh! Fuck! Fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck!

683
00:30:41,863 --> 00:30:42,831
What?

684
00:30:42,963 --> 00:30:43,965
I forgot the cake.

685
00:30:44,098 --> 00:30:45,166
- I'm so sorry.
- Ah, dude.

686
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:46,635
- Dammit.
- All I wanted was cake.

687
00:30:46,768 --> 00:30:48,469
I thought all you wanted
was sexy time?

688
00:30:48,603 --> 00:30:49,805
Don't make me choose Michael.

689
00:30:49,938 --> 00:30:51,607
You're not going
to like the answer.

690
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,474
Look, I, uh...

691
00:30:53,609 --> 00:30:55,477
I so appreciate
what you've done here.

692
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:58,046
I can tell that
you went to a ton of trouble.

693
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,815
And I'm so grateful, but...

694
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:02,017
man, if you didn't forget

695
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:03,619
what a drag High School was.

696
00:31:03,751 --> 00:31:06,488
I don't understand.
How was it a drag, exactly?

697
00:31:06,622 --> 00:31:07,689
Okay. A.

698
00:31:08,023 --> 00:31:10,426
We were a bunch
of shallow dicks in High School.

699
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:13,427
And B. Dressing up
in our shallow dick uniforms

700
00:31:13,562 --> 00:31:14,997
is just gonna
remind people of C,

701
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:17,431
go back to A. We were
a bunch of shallow dicks.

702
00:31:17,565 --> 00:31:20,036
But we were teenagers.
Nobody gives a shit anymore.

703
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:21,370
I'm guessing a few
of these people

704
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:22,571
hold some serious resentments.

705
00:31:22,703 --> 00:31:24,172
No joke. It's only human nature.

706
00:31:24,306 --> 00:31:26,341
You are wrong.
Check this out, okay?

707
00:31:26,807 --> 00:31:27,508
The ham-burglar.

708
00:31:27,642 --> 00:31:29,010
Okay, Trudy, fine. Sorry.

709
00:31:29,143 --> 00:31:31,413
I wouldn't be caught dead
with her in High School

710
00:31:31,546 --> 00:31:33,180
now we play Farm Town together.

711
00:31:33,315 --> 00:31:35,084
Okay? She's got a cat
name Sylvester.

712
00:31:35,217 --> 00:31:36,383
Nickname is Sly.

713
00:31:36,517 --> 00:31:38,019
Okay. It sits upright
on the couch

714
00:31:38,153 --> 00:31:40,955
and looks like human being.
She walks it with a leash.

715
00:31:41,422 --> 00:31:43,090
How cool and weird is that?

716
00:31:43,592 --> 00:31:45,928
- Oh, thank you.
- [photographer] Sure thing.

717
00:31:46,428 --> 00:31:47,295
[Mike] All right?

718
00:31:47,429 --> 00:31:49,198
Everyone is happy. Okay?

719
00:31:49,331 --> 00:31:51,667
Here to celebrate you.
This is cool.

720
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:52,701
Okay.

721
00:31:56,671 --> 00:31:58,707
Hey, dark shades. Dark shades.

722
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,575
Dark shades.

723
00:31:59,708 --> 00:32:01,509
Hey, can you play the song?

724
00:32:01,642 --> 00:32:04,012
You know, the one, um,
the one with, like,

725
00:32:04,145 --> 00:32:06,047
the quiet guitar and the...

726
00:32:06,381 --> 00:32:08,517
Boom-boom. The drums.

727
00:32:09,418 --> 00:32:11,853
- Good one.
- [Doug] No, really. Hey.

728
00:32:11,987 --> 00:32:15,556
It's the song with the,
with the really quiet guitar.

729
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:18,994
It's ring-ling-ling-ling
and then the ding-ding-ding,

730
00:32:19,128 --> 00:32:21,030
boom-boom-boom, the drums.

731
00:32:21,162 --> 00:32:22,498
- Who's it by?
- [Doug] Oh.

732
00:32:22,632 --> 00:32:24,533
The guy.
The guy that plays the drums

733
00:32:24,665 --> 00:32:26,234
that goes boom. The...

734
00:32:26,367 --> 00:32:27,902
- Phil Collins?
- [Doug] No!

735
00:32:28,036 --> 00:32:29,671
Fuck! Damn.

736
00:32:30,605 --> 00:32:34,042
It's... the guy that plays the...
It's the song...

737
00:32:34,176 --> 00:32:36,946
Hey, I got an idea.
Why don't you Google it?

738
00:32:37,613 --> 00:32:39,148
Hush-hush. Bye-bye.

739
00:32:39,882 --> 00:32:42,851
Wow. More like
Doctor Throws Shade.

740
00:32:43,718 --> 00:32:47,154
Did you just shower me
with imaginary jizz?

741
00:32:47,288 --> 00:32:49,257
No. No.

742
00:32:49,557 --> 00:32:51,926
You're getting pretty brave
as you run away.

743
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,863
Ah, that's my jam.

744
00:32:55,396 --> 00:32:57,565
['80s pop music continues]

745
00:33:10,045 --> 00:33:12,714
You know that guy's got,
like, two million followers.

746
00:33:12,847 --> 00:33:15,651
Yeah, but they're all
Russian bots like those two.

747
00:33:16,751 --> 00:33:18,119
How do I get verified?

748
00:33:18,554 --> 00:33:19,721
No one knows.

749
00:33:21,123 --> 00:33:22,391
Verify me.

750
00:33:49,551 --> 00:33:51,654
Yo, Michael! Whoop-whoop!

751
00:34:02,064 --> 00:34:02,965
Oh, no.

752
00:34:05,566 --> 00:34:06,868
[Doug groans]

753
00:34:07,201 --> 00:34:09,236
Hey. Walk with me to get smokes.

754
00:34:09,603 --> 00:34:11,006
Someone took my pants.

755
00:34:11,138 --> 00:34:13,843
Oh. Do you need pants
to go buy smokes?

756
00:34:14,609 --> 00:34:16,044
Don't know. Never smoked.

757
00:34:16,911 --> 00:34:18,013
Oh, fuck it.

758
00:34:18,145 --> 00:34:19,546
Dude, this party,

759
00:34:19,913 --> 00:34:23,419
honestly, is a complete
and total fucking disaster.

760
00:34:23,551 --> 00:34:24,952
What are you talking about?

761
00:34:25,085 --> 00:34:28,323
- This party is epic.
- If it isn't your birthday.

762
00:34:28,457 --> 00:34:30,459
Listen.
Let the Red Fire kick in,

763
00:34:30,591 --> 00:34:32,493
- Pam will come around.
- I don't know.

764
00:34:32,928 --> 00:34:35,797
Richard, I know this isn't
how you wanted the day to end.

765
00:34:35,931 --> 00:34:39,201
- I get it.
- [Richard talks on phone]

766
00:34:39,335 --> 00:34:41,937
I'm telling you,
torching the deal at this point

767
00:34:42,069 --> 00:34:44,939
is so stupid. Just talk to him.
You're at the same

charity event.
Just walk on over.

[Richard] <i>I can't talk
to this guy. Fuck no.</i>

Don't burn this thing
to the ground

771
00:34:51,712 --> 00:34:53,149
over ego. Okay? Bye.

772
00:34:54,783 --> 00:34:57,018
- Hi.
- Hi. Boy,

773
00:34:57,785 --> 00:34:59,320
sounds like a three-alarm.

774
00:35:00,055 --> 00:35:01,489
Didn't know you were
a firefighter.

775
00:35:01,622 --> 00:35:04,592
Oh, no. Just a lawyer.

776
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:05,960
Oof.

777
00:35:07,194 --> 00:35:08,129
Sorry.

778
00:35:08,263 --> 00:35:09,797
It's okay. So, lemme guess,

779
00:35:09,931 --> 00:35:12,701
you climbed Everest
before the age of 25?

780
00:35:13,102 --> 00:35:15,870
Married the fit Peruvian
shaman lady

781
00:35:16,004 --> 00:35:18,006
who guided you to Machu Picchu.

782
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,910
Sailed around the globe
on a solar-powered boat.

783
00:35:21,042 --> 00:35:22,644
Let me down easy.
What've you been up to

784
00:35:22,777 --> 00:35:24,645
- the past 20 years?
- No, no, uh...

785
00:35:25,013 --> 00:35:27,848
Well, actually, no, I did go
on a cruise to Alaska.

786
00:35:28,315 --> 00:35:29,718
With my ex-wife and our son.

787
00:35:30,319 --> 00:35:32,487
But that was before
she married Claire.

788
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,489
My orthodontist partner.

789
00:35:34,622 --> 00:35:36,991
You're an orthodontist? Huh.

790
00:35:37,491 --> 00:35:39,861
Really? Uh, I thought
the more titillating part

791
00:35:39,995 --> 00:35:42,830
of that story would be my wife
leaving me for another woman.

792
00:35:42,964 --> 00:35:44,565
You always knew
how to surprise...

793
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,701
- [phone pings]
- Oh. Hold on, sorry.

794
00:35:49,603 --> 00:35:51,239
Twenty-four hour attorney, huh?

795
00:35:51,739 --> 00:35:53,241
- Must pay well.
- [Pam scoffs]

796
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:56,277
Don't be fooled by my, uh,
formal attire.

797
00:35:56,911 --> 00:35:58,980
I work out million dollar deals
for my clients all day

798
00:35:59,114 --> 00:36:00,815
and then go home
and try to figure out

799
00:36:00,948 --> 00:36:02,183
if my cheque has deposited

800
00:36:02,317 --> 00:36:04,585
before my cable autopay
has gone through.

801
00:36:04,718 --> 00:36:06,487
- And things like that.
- [phone pings]

802
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:07,723
Wow.

803
00:36:12,294 --> 00:36:14,596
- [clerk] Can I help you?
- A pack of lights

804
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:15,797
and tin of Wintergreen?

805
00:36:15,931 --> 00:36:17,466
I told Pam I'd quit.

806
00:36:17,598 --> 00:36:18,933
- [Doug] Did you?
- Not really.

807
00:36:19,268 --> 00:36:21,303
Don't you remember
health class, Doug?

808
00:36:21,437 --> 00:36:23,138
"Tobacco stunts your growth."

809
00:36:24,538 --> 00:36:25,607
Wait.

810
00:36:25,906 --> 00:36:28,509
- Phyllis. Phyllis Okano.
- Yeah.

811
00:36:28,643 --> 00:36:30,679
- Four-eyed Phyllis!
- Oh, he said it.

812
00:36:30,812 --> 00:36:32,547
- Okay.
- [laughing]

813
00:36:32,681 --> 00:36:35,083
Hey. What happened
to the other two?

814
00:36:35,417 --> 00:36:39,121
Oh. Total eye replacement.
I grow clones in my basement.

815
00:36:40,922 --> 00:36:43,058
- LOL.
- Yeah.

816
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,359
You look great.

817
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:46,428
Oh, thank you. So do you.

818
00:36:46,562 --> 00:36:48,096
That is a lie.

819
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:51,166
I look like High School me
went into anaphylactic shock.

820
00:36:51,299 --> 00:36:52,234
Oh.

821
00:36:52,366 --> 00:36:53,468
True, but...

822
00:36:53,902 --> 00:36:55,136
What happened to your pants?

823
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:57,005
We're having a big
High School reunion

824
00:36:57,138 --> 00:36:59,907
- over at the banquet hall.
- No, it's, uh, Pam's birthday.

825
00:37:00,042 --> 00:37:02,810
But your welcome to stop by
after your shift is over.

826
00:37:02,944 --> 00:37:04,613
Oh, I'm stuck here
until midnight,

827
00:37:04,747 --> 00:37:06,815
but wish Pam
happy birthday from me?

828
00:37:06,948 --> 00:37:08,482
- I will. I will.
- Thanks.

829
00:37:08,882 --> 00:37:10,051
- Uh, hey, Doug?
- Yeah.

830
00:37:10,585 --> 00:37:13,622
- Can I ask you a weird question?
- Absolutely. What's up?

831
00:37:14,122 --> 00:37:17,158
Did you toilet paper
my parents' house?

832
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,995
What!

833
00:37:21,129 --> 00:37:22,665
It happened a lot in High School

834
00:37:22,797 --> 00:37:24,431
and over the last years
it started up again,

835
00:37:24,565 --> 00:37:26,301
so my dad installed a camera.

836
00:37:28,002 --> 00:37:29,604
Smart.

837
00:37:29,937 --> 00:37:31,806
I ask because he showed it to me

838
00:37:31,939 --> 00:37:34,208
and the guy on there
looks a lot like you.

839
00:37:37,279 --> 00:37:38,747
That's weird.

840
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,248
You know I don't live there
anymore, right?

841
00:37:41,381 --> 00:37:42,450
Not since college.

842
00:37:42,584 --> 00:37:43,685
Yeah.

843
00:37:43,819 --> 00:37:45,321
Of course. Totally.

844
00:37:45,453 --> 00:37:47,355
I know you don't live
with your parents.

845
00:37:47,489 --> 00:37:49,591
You're an adult
and you moved somewhere else.

846
00:37:49,723 --> 00:37:52,727
I don't live with my parents.
Oh, I live with my mom now.

847
00:37:52,861 --> 00:37:57,132
Well see, coz my condo,
it went under in a sinkhole.

848
00:37:57,265 --> 00:37:58,999
- In the ground.
- A literal sinkhole?

849
00:37:59,134 --> 00:38:01,069
Okay. All right.
It's great seeing you.

850
00:38:01,203 --> 00:38:02,971
Yeah, it's great.
Oh, you look great.

851
00:38:03,103 --> 00:38:04,906
Okay. Thank you. So do you.

852
00:38:12,779 --> 00:38:14,950
- Dude, she's onto us.
- Us?

853
00:38:16,118 --> 00:38:18,652
I haven't toilet papered
her house since...

854
00:38:18,786 --> 00:38:20,321

855
00:38:22,424 --> 00:38:23,325
Man.

856
00:38:23,591 --> 00:38:25,626
We were such dicks.

857
00:38:26,093 --> 00:38:27,762
That's what Pam just said to me.

858
00:38:27,895 --> 00:38:29,930
I don't...
Do you really think so?

859
00:38:30,064 --> 00:38:33,134
Yeah, buddy, pfft, mega dicks.

860
00:38:35,136 --> 00:38:37,372
Well, she seems
to think you are, uh,

861
00:38:37,806 --> 00:38:39,842
still doing it. The papering.

862
00:38:39,975 --> 00:38:43,511
No, what she said
is a guy that looks like me

863
00:38:43,645 --> 00:38:45,547
- is still doing it.
- Mm-hmm.

00:40:57,178 --> 00:40:58,613
I think I lost my tooth.

878
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:01,549
It's gonna be all right.
We'll get you a new tooth.

879
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:05,252
- Yeah!
- [everyone] Yeah!

880
00:41:06,321 --> 00:41:09,123
You know that stuff's
good for inflammation?

881
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:11,158
Turmeric's a power spice.

882
00:41:11,426 --> 00:41:12,326
Huh.

883
00:41:18,598 --> 00:41:19,767
- Pam!
- Hi.

884
00:41:19,901 --> 00:41:21,169
[Doug] Guess who we ran into?

885
00:41:21,301 --> 00:41:23,470
- Who?
- Four-eyed Phyllis.

886
00:41:23,738 --> 00:41:24,939
[Karen] Oh, that poor girl.

887
00:41:25,073 --> 00:41:26,440
Why? What happened?

888
00:41:26,573 --> 00:41:29,142
Nothing. Only that we spent
half of our youth

889
00:41:29,277 --> 00:41:31,980
defacing her home
with Charmin's single ply.

890
00:41:32,113 --> 00:41:34,015
Really, it just came down
to geography.

891
00:41:34,147 --> 00:41:35,983
- [Karen] Exactly.
- [Travis] It's like her house

892
00:41:36,116 --> 00:41:38,118
is a trading post
on the trail of beers.

893
00:41:38,252 --> 00:41:40,354
Between High School
and Doug's mom's.

894
00:41:40,489 --> 00:41:41,690
Pam, you remember this?

895
00:41:42,022 --> 00:41:43,357
Yeah. Of course.

896
00:41:43,491 --> 00:41:44,625
Running from the police.

897
00:41:44,759 --> 00:41:47,629
Travis puking
under the neighbor's topiary.

898
00:41:47,761 --> 00:41:48,763
Just say shrubs.

899
00:41:48,897 --> 00:41:50,899
Yeah, totally remember. So fun.

900
00:41:51,299 --> 00:41:53,067
You know what?
I'm gonna give a toast.

901
00:41:53,201 --> 00:41:55,671
All right, let's get some shots
lined up, Maverick.

902
00:41:55,803 --> 00:41:56,736
All right.

903
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:58,406
Everyone, come on... Trudy.

904
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:00,475
Shannon. Toast, shots.

905
00:42:00,975 --> 00:42:02,376
Phil Collins.

906
00:42:02,511 --> 00:42:04,379
Um, all right, guys.

907
00:42:04,678 --> 00:42:05,913
So, it's... Thank you.

908
00:42:06,047 --> 00:42:07,015
It's recently been
brought to my attention

909
00:42:07,147 --> 00:42:09,017
that I... we all,

910
00:42:09,149 --> 00:42:11,719
I may have been a dick
back in High School.

911
00:42:11,852 --> 00:42:13,221
Which apparently I blocked out.

912
00:42:13,355 --> 00:42:16,892
If that is true,
if I wronged you in any way,

913
00:42:17,024 --> 00:42:18,992
from the bottom of my heart,
I apologize.

914
00:42:19,326 --> 00:42:21,029
Now that I'm not a
popular jerk anymore.

915
00:42:21,161 --> 00:42:23,497
[Mike] I hope
that I can make it up to you

916
00:42:23,631 --> 00:42:26,800
now that we're adults
and we have mortgages

917
00:42:26,933 --> 00:42:27,835
and hemorrhoids.

918
00:42:27,968 --> 00:42:29,803
Uh, look.

919
00:42:30,504 --> 00:42:32,606
A lot has changed
since High School.

920
00:42:32,973 --> 00:42:35,443
But one thing
has stayed the same.

921
00:42:36,611 --> 00:42:38,080
My love for this woman,

922
00:42:38,413 --> 00:42:39,314
right here.

923
00:42:39,881 --> 00:42:40,781
Pam.

924
00:42:41,283 --> 00:42:42,984
You did it for me then.

925
00:42:43,618 --> 00:42:45,087
You do it for me now.

926
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:46,622
I love you.

927
00:42:47,154 --> 00:42:48,089
Happy birthday.

928
00:42:48,221 --> 00:42:49,723
- Aw, thank you.
- Cheers.

929
00:42:49,857 --> 00:42:52,093
- Cheers everyone.
- [all] Cheers!

930
00:42:57,864 --> 00:42:59,167
My therapist and I

931
00:42:59,301 --> 00:43:01,370
have talked a lot
about that evening.

932
00:43:02,136 --> 00:43:03,036
- Okay.
- She says

933
00:43:03,171 --> 00:43:04,839
it shaped my character.

934
00:43:04,971 --> 00:43:05,772
Okay.

935
00:43:05,906 --> 00:43:07,107
That even though...

936
00:43:07,674 --> 00:43:09,176
we're born how we are,

937
00:43:09,877 --> 00:43:11,479
there are often incidents

938
00:43:12,114 --> 00:43:14,616
that introduce us
to our true nature.

939
00:43:15,716 --> 00:43:17,419
And that was likely one of them.

940
00:43:19,321 --> 00:43:22,556
I don't know if you read
my sixth self-published book?

941
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:23,591
No.

942
00:43:24,725 --> 00:43:26,060
Why not?

943
00:43:27,395 --> 00:43:30,131
I was able to relive
some of the more

944
00:43:31,466 --> 00:43:32,834
intimate moments

945
00:43:32,968 --> 00:43:34,803
from that long
President's weekend.

946
00:43:35,002 --> 00:43:36,103
You know.

947
00:43:36,904 --> 00:43:38,205
Fictionally, of course.

948
00:43:38,339 --> 00:43:39,274
Um.

949
00:43:40,408 --> 00:43:41,576
Say it.

950
00:43:47,047 --> 00:43:48,850
[whispering] She...
she's smelling me.

951
00:43:49,149 --> 00:43:50,417
What's up, Shannon?

952
00:43:50,551 --> 00:43:51,585
Hi...

953
00:43:53,288 --> 00:43:55,290
[DJ] You ever feel
like one of those things?

954
00:43:56,056 --> 00:43:57,024
[Travis] What things?

955
00:43:57,158 --> 00:44:00,627
Those things. The urinal loaf.

956
00:44:01,296 --> 00:44:04,098
I think it's...
I think it's called a cake.

957
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,535
It's a urinal cake.

958
00:44:10,837 --> 00:44:12,341
Ever feel like one of those?

959
00:44:13,174 --> 00:44:14,442
You know, just...

960
00:44:15,009 --> 00:44:17,212
a huge target on your back.

961
00:44:17,546 --> 00:44:19,846
So big, you can't miss
even when you're drunk.

962
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:21,381
People just love shooting

963
00:44:21,515 --> 00:44:24,085
their hard stream of hot piss
right up your ass?

964
00:44:24,218 --> 00:44:25,685
Like it's a game?

965
00:44:25,819 --> 00:44:27,254
You ever feel like that?

966
00:44:29,558 --> 00:44:31,726
- All the time.
- Constantly, yeah.

967
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,628
You guys are all right.

968
00:44:33,761 --> 00:44:35,663
Let me give you my card.

969
00:44:35,797 --> 00:44:36,698
What the...

970
00:44:38,399 --> 00:44:40,167
Well, look at that.

971
00:44:41,335 --> 00:44:44,071
That's gotta be 20 years old.

972
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:46,741
Here you go.

973
00:44:47,975 --> 00:44:49,210
DJ Shades.

974
00:44:49,877 --> 00:44:51,078
DJ Shades.

975
00:44:51,478 --> 00:44:53,181
See you guys after, right?

976
00:44:53,314 --> 00:44:55,149
[disgusted grunts]

977
00:44:58,852 --> 00:45:00,588
No, Dougie. That's so gross.

978
00:45:00,721 --> 00:45:02,790
Don't reach into... Ew!

979
00:45:02,924 --> 00:45:04,257
It's sealed.

980
00:45:04,392 --> 00:45:05,692
Come on there's gotta
be an expiration date

981
00:45:05,826 --> 00:45:07,062
on that shit. Let's go.

982
00:45:09,431 --> 00:45:12,067
No, Dougie. No, Dougie!

983
00:45:13,401 --> 00:45:15,103
Okay, okay. Wait. Maybe.

984
00:45:15,236 --> 00:45:17,872
Maybe it's like wine,
it gets better with age.

985
00:45:18,339 --> 00:45:19,574
Who would know?

986
00:45:20,841 --> 00:45:22,076
Karen.

987
00:45:33,921 --> 00:45:34,821
Boys?

988
00:45:35,422 --> 00:45:37,158
- [Travis] In here.
- Sweet.

989
00:45:39,493 --> 00:45:41,696
- Come on. Go, go, go, go.
- Okay, okay.

990
00:45:44,265 --> 00:45:45,799
Let me see the stuff? Ooh.

991
00:45:45,933 --> 00:45:46,935
How old is it?

992
00:45:47,067 --> 00:45:48,870
Ah, possibly decades.

993
00:45:49,571 --> 00:45:51,072
That color is concerning.

994
00:45:51,573 --> 00:45:53,841
What is the worst
that could happen?

995
00:45:54,408 --> 00:45:57,944
Sinusoid polyps, paralysis,
early onset death.

996
00:45:58,078 --> 00:45:59,613
So, kind of hard to say.

997
00:46:00,915 --> 00:46:02,117
[frightened gasps]

998
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:05,553
Do I need to write
up a detention?

999
00:46:06,553 --> 00:46:07,955
What are you three up to?

1000
00:46:08,089 --> 00:46:09,489
Nothing, Madame D'coy.

1001
00:46:09,622 --> 00:46:11,892
Actually, the boys reclaimed
some vintage cocaine

1002
00:46:12,026 --> 00:46:14,629
and we're trying to decide
if it's safe to ingest.

1003
00:46:14,895 --> 00:46:17,265
- Hand it over Douglas
- Yes, ma'am.

1004
00:46:24,839 --> 00:46:27,575
- Oh, my. [clears throat]
- Madame D'coy, you okay?

1005
00:46:28,209 --> 00:46:30,377
Been a long time, Travis.

1006
00:46:33,448 --> 00:46:35,482
- No, I'm a state employee now.
- I said.

1007
00:46:35,616 --> 00:46:36,517
Hmm-mm.

1008
00:46:36,984 --> 00:46:38,152
[snorts]

1009
00:46:39,587 --> 00:46:43,123
What do you say
we flee this <i>bordel,</i> you and I?

1010
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:46,260
- Uh, I'm Doug's ride.
- I can Uber.

1011
00:46:46,393 --> 00:46:48,863
- Um, take me home, Trav.
- You know,

1012
00:46:48,995 --> 00:46:51,165
they say the inside of a nostril

1013
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:54,636
has more pleasure receptors
than the vagina.

1014
00:46:56,504 --> 00:46:57,939
Okay, I'm gonna go see

1015
00:46:58,071 --> 00:47:00,740
if the caterers are restocking
the kale Caesar.

1016
00:47:01,142 --> 00:47:02,844
I'm gonna help her with that.

1017
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:04,613
Hmm.

1018
00:47:10,652 --> 00:47:12,888
[fast-paced music playing]

1019
00:47:13,654 --> 00:47:15,157
Whoa!

1020
00:47:30,270 --> 00:47:32,205
[phone vibrates]

1021
00:47:32,973 --> 00:47:35,677
Thought you were just
really excited to see me.

1022
00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:36,710
Sorry.

1023
00:47:37,745 --> 00:47:38,446
That's cool.

1024
00:47:38,578 --> 00:47:39,647
Your phone screen

1025
00:47:39,781 --> 00:47:41,616
is lighting up your cleavage.

1026
00:47:43,216 --> 00:47:45,219
- God's pocket.
- [Mike chuckles]

1027
00:47:46,087 --> 00:47:47,622
It's smaller than that.

1028
00:47:58,031 --> 00:48:00,234
[slower music playing]

[rock music playing]

1033
00:48:52,353 --> 00:48:54,556
Let's make some twirls.
Here we go.

1034
00:48:54,689 --> 00:48:56,290
Then you get in tight and I go.

1035
00:48:56,424 --> 00:48:57,458
Hey.

1036
00:48:57,991 --> 00:48:59,861
- Hey, man. What's up?
- You tell me.

1037
00:48:59,993 --> 00:49:02,062
Not much. Getting a drink.
Need anything?

1038
00:49:02,196 --> 00:49:04,998
For you to stop
molesting my friend out there.

1039
00:49:05,299 --> 00:49:07,835
[Fred] Oh.
Are you guys together?

1040
00:49:08,368 --> 00:49:09,303
What? Uh...

1041
00:49:09,437 --> 00:49:10,471
[both] No.

1042
00:49:10,603 --> 00:49:11,739
[Fred] Oh, all right.

1043
00:49:12,339 --> 00:49:15,375
Look man I'm here with those two
Yugoslavian pretzels, all right?

1044
00:49:15,709 --> 00:49:18,113
This? This is just dancing.

1045

[Travis] Oh, it's just dancing.

1046
00:49:20,147 --> 00:49:22,917
Okay. You zoot suit-wearing
motherfucker.

1047
00:49:23,051 --> 00:49:24,051
The zoot suit?

1048

I guess we all don't get
to wear steel-toed shoes

is that supposed to mean?

See, you were the shit
in High School.

1053
00:49:36,031 --> 00:49:39,834
In fact, you took a shit
on the hood of my Oldsmobile.

That was funny, yeah.

You know what wasn't funny?

1058
00:49:51,178 --> 00:49:54,180
My dad saved up for six months
to surprise me with that.

1059
00:49:54,915 --> 00:49:57,084
I didn't want to go home
to show him it.

1060
00:49:57,484 --> 00:49:58,486
So, instead,

1061
00:49:58,886 --> 00:50:00,254
I stood in that parking lot

1062
00:50:00,388 --> 00:50:02,357
and I cleaned it
in front of everybody.

00:50:04,457 --> 00:50:05,559

Oh, really? Already?

1086
00:51:06,654 --> 00:51:07,688
Figured the main event would

1087
00:51:07,821 --> 00:51:09,089
last more than two rounds.

1088

- Yeah, you were.

to the ground and pinned you,

your arms, legs, and body,

you'd have totally
fucked him up.

- That's normal.

You think it's from the fight
or from the cocaine?

Yes.

- Night, Momma.

00:51:50,698 --> 00:51:52,333
You should apply for that job.

- Yeah.

You know the Hebrew word
for wife is "eesha".

Which literally means
"my woman".

[shouting]

1228
00:59:07,067 --> 00:59:08,302
[Sarge] Get out of here.

1229
00:59:09,469 --> 00:59:10,770
- Thank you.
- You okay?

1230
00:59:10,904 --> 00:59:12,273
- Yeah. Thank you.
- All right.

1231
00:59:12,406 --> 00:59:13,473
[slow clap]

1232
00:59:13,607 --> 00:59:15,642
You guys are the same
cliquey assholes

1233
00:59:15,776 --> 00:59:17,111
you were in High School.

1234
00:59:17,477 --> 00:59:19,712
Except with a net worth
that's a fraction of mine.

1235
00:59:19,846 --> 00:59:21,614
And most of that is Pam's.

1236
00:59:21,748 --> 00:59:23,451
Pam, good job. I'm a fan.

1237
00:59:23,584 --> 00:59:24,218
Thank you.

1238
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:26,053
What the fuck is that?

1239
00:59:26,185 --> 00:59:28,521
- What the fuck is what?
- All over your face?

1240
00:59:30,290 --> 00:59:32,825
You smell like Mike and Ikes.

1241
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,295
Oh. Uh.

1242
00:59:35,428 --> 00:59:36,396
Seriously?

1243
00:59:36,830 --> 00:59:37,765
What?

1244
00:59:37,897 --> 00:59:39,966
Again with Professor McGonagall?

1245
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:41,735
- What do you care?
- That's a...

1246
00:59:42,236 --> 00:59:44,171
great, fucking question.

1247
00:59:45,239 --> 00:59:47,842
Yeah. Well, bon-fucking-jour.

1248
00:59:48,241 --> 00:59:50,276
- Bon, dear, bon.
- Get outta here.

1249
00:59:50,410 --> 00:59:52,278
[Sarge] Right. That's enough!

1250
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:55,681
You folks are worse
than a shipload of sailors

1251
00:59:55,815 --> 00:59:57,584
on a one-night pass.

1252
00:59:59,118 --> 01:00:01,087
You ought to get out more often.

1253
01:00:01,221 --> 01:00:04,257
And by get out, I mean
some place other than here.

1254
01:00:04,390 --> 01:00:05,759
[Doug] We haven't had cake yet.

1255
01:00:05,893 --> 01:00:08,896
Enough with the fucking cake,
already, Dougie.

1256
01:00:09,163 --> 01:00:11,131
[Sarge] Anything you leave
can be claimed

1257
01:00:11,265 --> 01:00:13,266
on the street in the morning.

1258
01:00:13,399 --> 01:00:14,602
Savages!

1259
01:00:16,069 --> 01:00:17,638
[Trudy] Jesus Christ.
I can't believe

1260
01:00:17,770 --> 01:00:20,039
I skipped Animal Planet
for this horseshit.

1261
01:00:20,174 --> 01:00:21,809
Who wants to get a real drink?

1262
01:00:22,209 --> 01:00:23,375
I own a bar downtown.

1263
01:00:23,643 --> 01:00:26,246
I've never been there,
but it gets good profit.

1264
01:00:26,379 --> 01:00:28,649
- You had me at "your own bar".
- All right.

1265
01:00:34,855 --> 01:00:36,757
[Trudy] Oh, Michael?
I knew you wouldn't be

1266
01:00:36,890 --> 01:00:39,493
much of an opponent,
but I just felt bad for you.

1267
01:00:39,627 --> 01:00:41,295
Sitting at home
with your kids all day,

1268
01:00:41,428 --> 01:00:43,029
posting all those
mopey pictures.

1269
01:00:43,330 --> 01:00:45,366
I thought this might
cheer you up, but, um,

1270
01:00:45,498 --> 01:00:46,968
if you can't figure out a way to

1271
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:48,501
wrangle a few digital
sheep into a pen,

1272
01:00:48,634 --> 01:00:51,372
then maybe you shouldn't
be playing this game at all.

1273
01:00:56,308 --> 01:00:59,046
So, I guess I'm gonna be
heading out with those guys. So.

1274
01:01:07,486 --> 01:01:09,789
Hey, you guys wanna get an Uber
to my mom's house?

1275
01:01:09,922 --> 01:01:10,823
Sure.

1276
01:01:10,957 --> 01:01:12,425
I'll get my own. Thanks.

1277
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:14,328
At this rate I'll probably
sober up in time

1278
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:16,964
to take my 7 a.m.
power yoga class.

1279
01:01:17,397 --> 01:01:19,899
- Are you kidding me right now?
- [Mike] What?

1280
01:01:20,167 --> 01:01:22,469
You're just gonna take the loss,
call it a night?

1281
01:01:22,602 --> 01:01:24,705
I tried to pay off
the old sea hag,

1282
01:01:24,839 --> 01:01:26,506
but he's not letting
us back in there.

1283
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:29,076
I don't mean
to go back in there.

1284
01:01:30,611 --> 01:01:33,346
That's where you guys
wanted to spend my birthday.

1285
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:35,615
Did it ever
occur to you to wonder

1286
01:01:35,748 --> 01:01:38,285
what I would wanna do
on my birthday?

1287
01:01:38,419 --> 01:01:39,886
Where do you wanna go tonight?

1288
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:42,922
I don't know. Just something
where I'm the decider.

1289
01:01:43,056 --> 01:01:44,524
Maybe you're never the decider

1290
01:01:44,658 --> 01:01:46,226
because you don't know
what you wanna do.

1291
01:01:46,359 --> 01:01:47,794
Shut up, Doug. I'm thinking.

1292
01:01:47,928 --> 01:01:48,761
Oh.

1293
01:01:48,895 --> 01:01:50,097
Fine.

1294
01:01:52,399 --> 01:01:53,734
I know what I wanna do.

1295
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:56,703
- Then call it.
- I wanna go toilet papering.

1296
01:01:56,837 --> 01:01:58,138
Ah, four-eyed Phyllis?

1297
01:01:58,270 --> 01:01:59,672
You know she only
has two eyes now.

1298
01:01:59,806 --> 01:02:01,108
[Pam] I don't...

1299
01:02:01,241 --> 01:02:02,909
I don't care is she's blind
or not blind,

1300
01:02:03,042 --> 01:02:04,877
I wanna do that shit up.

1301
01:02:05,011 --> 01:02:06,913
- Savage.
- Her dad...

1302
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:09,248
just installed
a surveillance camera.

1303
01:02:09,381 --> 01:02:11,051
It's easily disabled.

1304
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:17,658
From what I have read
on the internet.

1305
01:02:19,024 --> 01:02:20,660
Are you serious, Councilor?

1306
01:02:21,661 --> 01:02:23,564
Serious as a cease-and-desist.

1307
01:02:23,696 --> 01:02:25,498
I don't think it's a good idea.

1308
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:29,236
You never took me along

1309
01:02:29,368 --> 01:02:31,071
to vandalize

1310
01:02:31,203 --> 01:02:34,006
that poor girl's house.
Not once.

1311
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:37,543
Oh, my God. Did we hurt
your feeling?

1312
01:02:37,678 --> 01:02:40,247
[Janie] Dude,
I spent my entire youth

1313
01:02:40,681 --> 01:02:42,817
wishing I could hang out
with you guys.

1314
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:44,618
And this is what I was missing?

1315
01:02:44,984 --> 01:02:45,885
Yeah.

1316
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:47,755
What's it to you?

1317
01:02:49,022 --> 01:02:50,190
Where are you going?

1318
01:02:50,323 --> 01:02:51,458
I'm going downtown
to get a drink.

1319
01:02:51,591 --> 01:02:53,425
Hey. Do you want
me to come with you?

1320
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:54,328
No.

1321
01:02:54,727 --> 01:02:56,763
You take my sister
toilet papering.

1322
01:02:57,364 --> 01:02:58,865
But you almost did it, Doug.

1323
01:02:59,431 --> 01:03:00,433
I'm proud of you.

1324
01:03:00,734 --> 01:03:02,502
If I was
just a little bit drunker

1325
01:03:02,636 --> 01:03:04,471
and you still
had all your teeth,

1326
01:03:04,603 --> 01:03:06,071
you could've made this work out.

1327
01:03:06,573 --> 01:03:08,375
Progress was made, big buddy.

1328
01:03:08,942 --> 01:03:10,311
Progress was made.

1329
01:03:15,314 --> 01:03:17,717
[rock music playing]

1330
01:03:18,285 --> 01:03:19,587
[Doug grunts]

1331
01:03:21,888 --> 01:03:22,890
Phyllis go home?

1332
01:03:23,290 --> 01:03:24,625
She did.

1333
01:03:25,392 --> 01:03:26,926
Are you the guy
that toilet papers

1334
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:27,995
her folks' house?

1335
01:03:28,127 --> 01:03:29,863
She said he came in tonight.

1336
01:03:30,964 --> 01:03:31,898
No.

1337
01:03:32,698 --> 01:03:34,567
I'm just a very diligent wiper.

1338
01:03:35,468 --> 01:03:37,837
Looks like you're ready
for business, then.

1339
01:03:39,172 --> 01:03:40,340
Yes.

1340
01:03:40,573 --> 01:03:42,675
Hey, Mr. Whipple, car's here,
let's go.

1341
01:03:44,544 --> 01:03:47,579
Well, we all
have our special gifts.

1342
01:03:47,913 --> 01:03:50,750
- I saw you eat a piece of pizza.
- It was delicious.

1343
01:03:56,790 --> 01:03:58,992
Hey, my man,
you mind killing these lights?

1344
01:03:59,426 --> 01:04:00,593
Dude turn off the lights.

1345
01:04:00,727 --> 01:04:01,795
I think he's concerned
he's Ubering us

1346
01:04:01,928 --> 01:04:03,028
on a drive-by.

1347
01:04:03,330 --> 01:04:05,132
- Stop!
- [Mike] What!

1348
01:04:05,265 --> 01:04:06,832
- [Doug] That's it.
- [Pam] What's it?

1349
01:04:07,067 --> 01:04:09,103
That's the song
I've been requesting all night.

1350
01:04:09,236 --> 01:04:11,171
[Travis] Dude,
this song is from 2006.

1351
01:04:11,305 --> 01:04:14,440
Yeah, Dougie, you know this is
the song that band was playing

1352
01:04:14,573 --> 01:04:16,976
when you stage-dived
and broke your clavicle.

1353
01:04:17,477 --> 01:04:20,779
Oh. At the Osteoporosis Benefit.

1354
01:04:21,181 --> 01:04:24,185
No wonder he didn't know
what I was talking about.

1355
01:04:26,051 --> 01:04:27,587
It's go-time, people.

1356
01:04:36,029 --> 01:04:38,399
Don't worry, I got you, Boo.
Four stars.

1357
01:04:39,165 --> 01:04:41,701
You lose one because of
that Funyun smell in here.

1358
01:04:50,910 --> 01:04:53,279
[Mike] Guys,
are we really feeling this?

1359
01:04:53,413 --> 01:04:54,881
I'm kinda tired
and the babysitter

1360
01:04:55,015 --> 01:04:56,315
just hit triple digits.

1361
01:04:56,448 --> 01:04:58,784
- Don't be a pussy, Mike.
- Whoa. A pussy? Okay.

1362
01:04:58,919 --> 01:05:01,587
Three hours ago you called me
a dick, now I'm a pussy.

1363
01:05:01,721 --> 01:05:03,390
Who's the dick now, Captain TP?

1364
01:05:03,522 --> 01:05:05,424
Okay, ever since text-a-palooza
happened, over here

1365
01:05:05,558 --> 01:05:07,794
- it's become a fluid situation.
- Ouch.

1366
01:05:08,094 --> 01:05:10,497
- Give me one of those.
- I got you, babe.

1367
01:05:11,631 --> 01:05:14,700
Thank you. It's. You know,
tomorrow's a new day. Okay?

1368
01:05:15,033 --> 01:05:16,068
What is happening?

1369
01:05:16,536 --> 01:05:18,538
I like 40-year old Pam.
She's a badass.

1370
01:05:28,114 --> 01:05:29,049
I'm going in.

1371
01:05:29,482 --> 01:05:31,284
Oh. Leroy Jenkins!

1372
01:05:31,417 --> 01:05:33,720
[Pam squeals excitedly]

1373
01:05:40,027 --> 01:05:41,895
What can I get you,
mademoiselle?

1374
01:05:42,930 --> 01:05:45,064
Do you know what happened
to the last man

1375
01:05:45,198 --> 01:05:46,232
who said that to me?

1376
01:05:46,765 --> 01:05:50,436
Oh, you smothered him
with your furious passion,

1377
01:05:50,571 --> 01:05:52,471
but denied him the honey
of your fruits,

1378
01:05:52,605 --> 01:05:54,774
causing him
to wither into a husk

1379
01:05:54,908 --> 01:05:57,645
of eternal longing
and desperation?

1380
01:05:59,111 --> 01:06:00,680
How did you know?

1381
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:03,017
I'm not a chimp.

1382
01:06:07,788 --> 01:06:09,990
[Fred] Hey,
isn't that Pam's sister?

1383
01:06:11,290 --> 01:06:14,160
Well, I'll be Steven
Patrick Morrissey, it is.

1384
01:06:14,493 --> 01:06:15,894
Your sister's
a real piece of work.

1385
01:06:16,029 --> 01:06:17,398
Yeah, she is.

1386
01:06:17,531 --> 01:06:19,166
[Janie] She stupidly
married into a fraternity,

1387
01:06:19,299 --> 01:06:21,368
but she works harder
than all of us,

1388
01:06:21,502 --> 01:06:23,870
and she still has time
to raise two rad kids.

1389
01:06:24,004 --> 01:06:26,439
Yeah, well, complicity
is culpability.

1390
01:06:26,573 --> 01:06:28,440
She's not the only lawyer
up in here.

1391
01:06:28,942 --> 01:06:30,877
Pam didn't remember
the defining night

1392
01:06:31,009 --> 01:06:32,379
of my adolescence.

1393
01:06:33,547 --> 01:06:35,782
Sleeping
in your dark living room.

1394
01:06:36,216 --> 01:06:38,085
Crawling into my sleeping bag.

1395
01:06:38,419 --> 01:06:40,886
Caressing cabbage patches
in the dark.

1396
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:43,857
What are you talking about?
That wasn't Pam, that was me.

1397
01:06:43,989 --> 01:06:45,491
- No.
- Yeah.

1398
01:06:46,558 --> 01:06:47,761
It wasn't...

1399
01:06:49,296 --> 01:06:50,596
- Yeah.
- Wait.

1400
01:06:51,964 --> 01:06:52,899
What?

1401
01:06:53,033 --> 01:06:54,601
Remember, Sting threw up
on a pillow,

1402
01:06:54,734 --> 01:06:56,536
we had to share one
and you were wearing those

1403
01:06:56,669 --> 01:06:58,838
Thundercat underoos.

1404
01:07:01,875 --> 01:07:03,376
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

1405
01:07:03,810 --> 01:07:06,546
You were, like, the first
edgy girl I'd ever seen.

1406
01:07:06,913 --> 01:07:09,716
So mysterious.
Smoking those cloves.

1407
01:07:09,848 --> 01:07:13,519
In your short skirts
and those Doc Martens.

1408
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:16,455
I even hooked up with a girl
freshmen year

1409
01:07:16,589 --> 01:07:18,392
in my dorms who looked like you.

1410
01:07:18,792 --> 01:07:21,027
- You don't say.
- True story.

1411
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:24,364
[Lloyd] You know Klaus Martens
was a doctor in World War II?

1412
01:07:24,497 --> 01:07:26,599
Broke his ankle
skiing in the Bavarian Alps.

1413
01:07:26,732 --> 01:07:28,935
And found that the standard
<i>wehrmacht</i> boots

1414
01:07:29,069 --> 01:07:32,205
were too painful,
so he invented his own.

1415
01:07:32,772 --> 01:07:34,940
Okay. Thanks for the update,
Anne Frank.

1416
01:07:35,075 --> 01:07:36,975
So, where's
the royal court tonight?

1417
01:07:37,109 --> 01:07:39,912
Smashing mailboxes,
tipping cows?

1418
01:07:40,614 --> 01:07:42,916
Close.
A toilet papering mission.

1419
01:07:43,382 --> 01:07:44,618
Did you say toilet papering?

1420
01:07:45,218 --> 01:07:48,587
That pot-bellied motherfucker!
[squeals softly]

1421
01:07:48,989 --> 01:07:51,392
I thought she was asleep
the whole time.

1422
01:07:52,658 --> 01:07:53,859
- All right.
- Hey.

1423
01:07:53,993 --> 01:07:55,328
[Mike whispers]

1424
01:07:55,462 --> 01:07:56,429
Bro.

1425
01:07:56,562 --> 01:07:58,497
[inspirational music playing]

1426
01:07:58,964 --> 01:08:01,634
[Mike] Go take it, big boy.
Go, take it.

1427
01:08:02,835 --> 01:08:04,571
[Pam] Yes! Yes, yes...

1428
01:08:12,312 --> 01:08:15,982
[Mike] That's it.
Yeah, sweetheart. Good one.

1429
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:19,051
[Doug] Here we go.

1430
01:08:22,054 --> 01:08:24,457
- [Travis] Gotcha!
- Get out of the way.

1431
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:36,437
[fireworks booming]

1432
01:08:40,372 --> 01:08:41,507
[Mike] Nice.

1433
01:08:43,276 --> 01:08:44,845
Time to bring in the closer.

1434
01:08:55,621 --> 01:08:56,722
Still got it.

1435
01:09:04,296 --> 01:09:06,834
- [Pam] It's beautiful.
- [Doug] It really is.

1436
01:09:08,667 --> 01:09:11,205
What if I was meant to do this?

1437
01:09:12,005 --> 01:09:13,073

1438
01:09:13,406 --> 01:09:14,741
I'm serious, dude.

1439
01:09:15,474 --> 01:09:18,076
What if I was meant to do <i>this?</i>

1440
01:09:19,077 --> 01:09:22,048
I'm decidedly mediocre
at everything.

1441
01:09:22,715 --> 01:09:24,017
I always have been.

1442
01:09:25,385 --> 01:09:27,420
I mean, Pam's a super lawyer.

1443
01:09:27,888 --> 01:09:30,323
Karen can design
a store-front window

1444
01:09:30,456 --> 01:09:32,024
that nobody can ignore.

1445
01:09:32,792 --> 01:09:36,028
Mikey can throw a baseball
100 miles an hour.

1446
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:38,697
Jesus, what can't you do?

1447
01:09:38,831 --> 01:09:42,268
Resist 65-year old poutine,
evidently.

1448
01:09:43,903 --> 01:09:47,173
I mean, what if I was put
on God's green earth

1449
01:09:47,305 --> 01:09:49,009
to do this?

1450
01:09:49,876 --> 01:09:52,179
If you put it as your profession
on your Schedule C,

1451
01:09:52,312 --> 01:09:54,514
you could probably
write off the toilet paper.

1452
01:09:54,647 --> 01:09:55,782
Oh, shit.

1453
01:09:56,315 --> 01:09:57,184
Cops.

1454
01:09:57,584 --> 01:09:59,618
- Quickly, quickly.
- Save these.

1455
01:09:59,752 --> 01:10:01,822
- Let's go.
- Come on, come on.

1456
01:10:01,955 --> 01:10:04,323
- Come on. Follow me.
- My bag!

1457
01:10:04,456 --> 01:10:05,591
Follow me.

1458

1459

1460
01:10:10,663 --> 01:10:12,599
Come on, sweetheart.
Fast as you can.

1461
01:10:12,864 --> 01:10:15,468
Hurry, hurry, hurry.
Come on, give me your hand.

1462
01:10:15,602 --> 01:10:17,537
- Grab one.
- [grunts]

1463
01:10:18,371 --> 01:10:19,940
What are you doing?

1464
01:10:20,072 --> 01:10:21,607
These bags are our life, are you
kidding me I can't leave them.

1465
01:10:21,742 --> 01:10:23,810
Leave the bag,
please, I beg you.

- Dammit. Give me your hand.

1469

- Okay. Good. Pull, pull, pull.
- [Pam] Ow! I got a splinter.

Sweetheart.

1471
01:10:34,086 --> 01:10:35,955
I feel like I have a
tweezer in my bag.

[officer] <i>Put your hands up
and walk slowly out to the tre.</i>

[Mike] Give it, give it.
Come on!

1474
01:10:41,662 --> 01:10:43,997
- Get your foot up there.
- [Pam] Oh. Oh. Ow.

1475
01:10:44,130 --> 01:10:46,665
- [officer] Ma'am.
- [Pam] Handcuffs? Come on.

1476
01:10:47,399 --> 01:10:48,634
[officer] Ma'am, calm down.

1477
01:10:48,768 --> 01:10:50,136
- Pam!
- [Pam] Ow. Ow.

1478
01:10:50,269 --> 01:10:52,537
- Watch the phone.
- [officer] I've got my own.

1479
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:54,105
Let's go, ladies. Come on.

1480
01:10:54,239 --> 01:10:55,774
[Pam] Excuse me,
I am an attorney.

1481
01:10:56,242 --> 01:10:57,677
- Okay?
- [officer] Oh, good.

1482
01:10:57,809 --> 01:11:00,147
Then you can represent yourself.

1483
01:11:00,580 --> 01:11:01,715
Fuck.

1484
01:11:03,215 --> 01:11:05,651

Where's Pam?

1486
01:11:21,367 --> 01:11:22,301
The cops got her.

1487
01:11:23,035 --> 01:11:25,138
[Travis] Dude you saved
the crocodile and not your wife?

1488
01:11:25,272 --> 01:11:27,305
Dude, she could be disbarred
for this.

1489
01:11:27,439 --> 01:11:29,843
[Doug] Why didn't you just
let them take you?

1490
01:11:29,975 --> 01:11:31,478
It's not like you got a job.

1491
01:11:32,011 --> 01:11:33,145
I didn't think of that.

1492
01:11:33,279 --> 01:11:34,982
[Karen] She's gonna be
so pissed.

1493
01:11:35,848 --> 01:11:37,250
We can't leave her in jail.

1494
01:11:37,384 --> 01:11:38,685
She's too pretty and kind.

1495
01:11:38,818 --> 01:11:40,821
Yeah, and her kids
will be orphans.

1496
01:11:41,787 --> 01:11:43,357
Financially speaking.

1497
01:11:44,623 --> 01:11:45,524
All right.

tell them the whole story,

1500
01:11:49,929 --> 01:11:51,730
and we'll offer ourselves
in exchange.

1501
01:11:51,863 --> 01:11:53,265
They'll let her out, right?

1502
01:11:53,399 --> 01:11:55,334
I don't think
cops barter, buddy.

1503
01:11:56,102 --> 01:11:58,805
But if that's what you wanna do,
I'm down for whatever.

1504
01:11:58,938 --> 01:12:01,273
- Clearly, <i>mon ami.</i>
- Come on.

The one who hasn't seen her
in three weeks.

1510

to cut down a couple of trees.

just took her to jail.

01:14:50,777 --> 01:14:51,877
No.

1566
01:15:06,158 --> 01:15:07,560
[loud exhale]

1567
01:15:08,928 --> 01:15:11,264
Hey, K. I'm sorry.

1568
01:15:12,197 --> 01:15:14,334
Hey. Come on. Karen.

1569
01:15:14,701 --> 01:15:15,635
I know I fucked up.

1570
01:15:15,768 --> 01:15:16,569
I'm sorry.

1571
01:15:16,702 --> 01:15:17,970
Of course you fucked up.

1572
01:15:18,237 --> 01:15:19,738
You always fuck up.

1573
01:15:19,872 --> 01:15:22,140
Especially when it seems
we're on the verge of thinking

1574
01:15:22,274 --> 01:15:24,611
that whatever this mess of
lip blisters and broken dreams

1575
01:15:24,743 --> 01:15:26,112
has been for the last 30 years,

1576
01:15:26,246 --> 01:15:28,047
is finally coming
to fucking fruition.

1577
01:15:28,179 --> 01:15:31,116
Hold on. You never once told me
how you really felt,

1578
01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:32,452
- so how am I...
- No, no, no.

1579
01:15:32,585 --> 01:15:34,421
You don't get
to play dumb anymore.

1580
01:15:34,554 --> 01:15:37,757
You fucking sabotage
this every chance you get.

1581
01:15:37,890 --> 01:15:39,325
- That's not true.
- You know,

1582
01:15:39,459 --> 01:15:42,996
I have always wondered
why I'm not good enough for you.

1583
01:15:43,630 --> 01:15:45,632
When the real
fucking question is

1584
01:15:46,131 --> 01:15:48,868
why I ever thought
you were good enough for me.

1585
01:15:50,036 --> 01:15:51,203
Doug!

1586
01:15:51,737 --> 01:15:53,172
Give me the damn skippy.

1587
01:16:02,281 --> 01:16:03,550
[door clicks open]

1588
01:16:11,256 --> 01:16:13,026
[laughs] Richard?

1589
01:16:13,727 --> 01:16:15,862
They wouldn't let me
buy your way out.

1590
01:16:16,194 --> 01:16:17,596
So, I'm on my way in.

1591
01:16:17,730 --> 01:16:21,300
You... you paid to get in here?

1592
01:16:22,667 --> 01:16:25,203
Actually,
I think the term they used

1593
01:16:25,337 --> 01:16:29,140
was attempting to bribe
an officer of the law, but...

1594
01:16:29,507 --> 01:16:31,877
I assured them my attorney
would prove my innocence.

1595
01:16:32,011 --> 01:16:35,848
Oh, I can't even go to jail
without you bothering me.

1596
01:16:35,982 --> 01:16:38,117
Your husband has
made it abundantly clear

1597
01:16:38,250 --> 01:16:41,388
that I have boundary issues.

1598
01:16:41,688 --> 01:16:42,922
Wait. You spoke to Mike?

1599
01:16:43,055 --> 01:16:45,257
He gave me a piece of his mind

1600
01:16:45,390 --> 01:16:47,626
about how I've been abusing you.

1601
01:16:48,794 --> 01:16:50,029
He's protective.

1602
01:16:50,962 --> 01:16:52,098
Seems unstable.

1603
01:16:52,232 --> 01:16:53,466
Well you would be unstable too

1604
01:16:53,599 --> 01:16:55,100
if you had to take care
of two kids,

1605
01:16:55,233 --> 01:16:56,902
do all the laundry,
and the cooking,

1606
01:16:57,037 --> 01:16:59,305
and just hear nothing
but complaints

1607
01:16:59,438 --> 01:17:00,839
from your unappreciative wife

1608
01:17:00,974 --> 01:17:03,142
for throwing her
a lovely surprise party.

1609
01:17:03,274 --> 01:17:05,944
All because she has
a very stubborn client

1610
01:17:06,077 --> 01:17:07,679
who won't just pay to remove

1611
01:17:07,813 --> 01:17:10,282
a couple of willow trees
from an easement.

1612
01:17:14,153 --> 01:17:16,156
I have been a pain in the ass.

1613
01:17:16,922 --> 01:17:18,724
[sighs] Because I let you.

1614
01:17:20,993 --> 01:17:22,528
I am a deal junkie.

1615
01:17:24,496 --> 01:17:25,664
If it helps,

1616
01:17:26,265 --> 01:17:28,300
I did what you told me to do.

1617
01:17:28,768 --> 01:17:29,969
Oh, boy.

1618
01:17:30,103 --> 01:17:33,172
I talked to doctor, uh,
douche-bag,

1619
01:17:33,305 --> 01:17:34,439
face-to-face.

1620
01:17:35,041 --> 01:17:37,710
And we agreed one of us
would pay for the tree removal

1621
01:17:37,843 --> 01:17:40,145
and the other one
would waive the encroachment.

1622
01:17:40,278 --> 01:17:41,246
Wait, wait.

1623
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:43,082
So the deal was back on?

1624
01:17:43,215 --> 01:17:45,517
- Soon as I can sign the papers.
- Which I have with me.

1625
01:17:45,651 --> 01:17:47,185
I think
I have the papers with me.

1626
01:17:47,319 --> 01:17:49,188
That is if Mike got them
off the lawn

1627
01:17:49,322 --> 01:17:50,556
when I was hog-tied.

1628
01:17:52,692 --> 01:17:53,593
Just hold on.

1629
01:17:54,359 --> 01:17:57,197
[quiet music playing]

1630
01:18:15,781 --> 01:18:17,017
[Trudy] Hey, guys.

1631
01:18:19,919 --> 01:18:21,720
You should be in jail by now.

1632
01:18:21,854 --> 01:18:22,722
We should,

1633
01:18:22,854 --> 01:18:24,357
but unfortunately,

1634
01:18:24,489 --> 01:18:26,960
Pam is the only one
that was incarcerated.

1635
01:18:27,426 --> 01:18:29,228
[Travis] Mike's worried
she might get disbarred.

1636
01:18:29,362 --> 01:18:31,397
We were hoping
if we cleaned up the mess,

1637
01:18:31,529 --> 01:18:33,299
you might drop the charges.

1638
01:18:33,899 --> 01:18:34,933
Why do you do this?

1639
01:18:35,401 --> 01:18:37,769
My dad is a saint
and he has enough to worry about

1640
01:18:37,903 --> 01:18:39,371
without all this bullshit.

1641
01:18:40,105 --> 01:18:41,306
Not that you'd care.

1642
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:42,575
I care.

1643
01:18:43,809 --> 01:18:44,676
What's wrong?

1644
01:18:44,809 --> 01:18:45,944
What isn't?

1645
01:18:46,211 --> 01:18:47,679
My dad spends half his week
at hospitals

1646
01:18:47,813 --> 01:18:50,449
and I moved back home
and I quit my job and...

1647
01:18:50,815 --> 01:18:51,718
Whatever.

1648
01:18:53,118 --> 01:18:55,087
My mom has a bum thyroid.

1649
01:18:55,220 --> 01:18:56,822
Mine has skin cancer.

1650
01:18:57,790 --> 01:18:58,825
Mine's gone.

1651
01:19:00,626 --> 01:19:01,728
Two months ago.

1652
01:19:05,029 --> 01:19:06,265
I'm really sorry.

1653
01:19:07,299 --> 01:19:08,401
About everything.

[Madame D'coy] Life.

1655
01:19:11,136 --> 01:19:12,504
So beautiful.

1656
01:19:12,871 --> 01:19:14,140
And so fleeting.

1657
01:19:20,513 --> 01:19:21,413
Hey!

1658
01:19:22,982 --> 01:19:24,617
You did this!

1659
01:19:31,657 --> 01:19:32,559
Yes, sir.

1660
01:19:33,526 --> 01:19:34,426
I did.

1661
01:19:35,995 --> 01:19:37,096
Me too.

1662
01:19:37,796 --> 01:19:38,730
And me!

1663
01:19:39,098 --> 01:19:40,300
Spartacus.

1664
01:19:40,965 --> 01:19:41,968
Sure.

1665
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:43,202
Whatever.

1666
01:19:43,736 --> 01:19:44,670
Sorry, Dad.

1667
01:19:44,803 --> 01:19:46,272
We'll clean it up.

1668
01:19:47,540 --> 01:19:49,142
You all need to grow up.

1669
01:19:50,041 --> 01:19:51,410
[emotional music playing]

1670
01:19:52,545 --> 01:19:54,480
- Your dad's nice.
- He's not wrong.

1671
01:20:06,259 --> 01:20:08,728
So, I guess I just start
cleaning up, or...

1672
01:20:12,764 --> 01:20:14,899
[Doug] You know,
they should have a place

1673
01:20:15,033 --> 01:20:17,702
where adults can go and TP
and let off steam

1674
01:20:17,836 --> 01:20:21,373
without the fear
of their spouse being arrested.

1675
01:20:22,507 --> 01:20:23,709
I'd invest in that.

1676
01:20:24,042 --> 01:20:24,942
Really?

1677
01:20:25,243 --> 01:20:26,144
Well, why not?

1678
01:20:26,612 --> 01:20:28,279
They got adult coloring books,

1679
01:20:28,413 --> 01:20:30,181
those mature fidget spinners.

1680
01:20:30,882 --> 01:20:32,818
Couldn't be dumber
than that shit.

1681
01:20:33,117 --> 01:20:34,019
Let's do it.

1682
01:20:34,319 --> 01:20:35,420
All right.

1683
01:20:37,023 --> 01:20:37,924
[Travis] Hey.

1684
01:20:39,125 --> 01:20:41,394
Hey, hey. I got it. I got it.

1685
01:20:44,929 --> 01:20:46,431
Listen, you know this.

1686
01:20:48,434 --> 01:20:49,602
I don't have the best luck with

people sticking
around in my life.

1688
01:20:51,604 --> 01:20:52,906
But you're still here.

1689
01:20:54,473 --> 01:20:55,707
And the thing that...

1690
01:20:56,875 --> 01:20:57,810
fucking scares me,

1691
01:20:59,144 --> 01:21:00,846
really, fucking scares me,

1692
01:21:02,113 --> 01:21:04,817
is that we give this a go
and you leave me too.

1693
01:21:09,388 --> 01:21:10,489
Well.

1694
01:21:13,492 --> 01:21:15,461

[Mike] Oh, baby.

1703

- I'm so sorry...
- Tell me you have my bags.

[Mike] Of course I do.

Oh, this is Mike.

01:22:34,273 --> 01:22:35,574
We spoke on the phone.

- Oh, you're...
- Real husband meet work husband.

This is Richard.

All right.
We have a deal to close.

Here's the last one.

1711
01:22:51,491 --> 01:22:53,158
I'd be lost without your wife.

01:22:53,492 --> 01:22:55,628
Ditto, man. She's the best.

Get some rest, Pamela.

any last-second hiccups.

that you do for us.

- That will never happen again.
- Gosh, don't say sorry.

is coming up real soon, so.

- [Pam] Look.
- [Mike] Aw.

01:24:52,978 --> 01:24:54,645
Having trouble
finding a replacement.

1743
01:24:54,779 --> 01:24:56,281
I don't have
a teaching credential.

1744
01:24:56,415 --> 01:24:59,285
Fortunately, your services
aren't needed to teach Physics.

1745
01:24:59,852 --> 01:25:01,653
Oh, good. Yeah, I, uh,

1746
01:25:01,787 --> 01:25:04,557
the only reason I passed
was by copying Pam anyway.

1747
01:25:04,924 --> 01:25:06,390
Well, why don't you come by
and see me on Monday.

1748
01:25:06,524 --> 01:25:07,526
We'll talk about it.

1749
01:25:07,926 --> 01:25:09,996
- Yes, sir.
- And, uh, Mike,

1750
01:25:10,563 --> 01:25:11,831
wear some god damn pants.

1751
01:25:11,964 --> 01:25:13,599
I'm gonna ask the
principal to come by.

1752
01:25:14,032 --> 01:25:15,300
Pants. Check.

1753
01:25:15,434 --> 01:25:17,435
Oh, and, uh,
happy birthday, Pam.

1754
01:25:17,568 --> 01:25:19,971
Oh, thanks, Coach.

1755
01:25:28,980 --> 01:25:30,916
I'm sure I could still
get the kids to school.

1756
01:25:31,049 --> 01:25:33,986
You know practices are in the
afternoon, a few weekend games.

1757
01:25:34,118 --> 01:25:35,121
Mike.

1758
01:25:35,854 --> 01:25:36,755
Pam.

1759
01:25:37,456 --> 01:25:38,858
Michael.

1760
01:25:40,326 --> 01:25:41,359
Pamela.

1761
01:25:41,727 --> 01:25:42,995
I see you.

1762
01:25:43,495 --> 01:25:45,029
I appreciate you.

1763
01:25:45,330 --> 01:25:46,364
And I love you.

1764
01:25:46,765 --> 01:25:48,899
And if this is
what makes you happy,

1765
01:25:49,033 --> 01:25:51,470
then that's
what I want you to do.

1766
01:25:55,107 --> 01:25:57,542
So am I still
on sexy time restriction?

1767
01:26:00,312 --> 01:26:02,215
Upgraded to probation.

1768
01:26:10,622 --> 01:26:13,125
- I love you, Pam.
- I love you too.

1769
01:26:16,127 --> 01:26:20,064
[Pam] Now, will you please,
for the love of God,

1770
01:26:20,198 --> 01:26:21,800
take me home.

1771
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:23,736
Yes, ma'am.

1773
01:26:52,297 --> 01:26:53,198
Hi.

1774
01:26:54,567 --> 01:26:56,868
Hey, I'm thinking
about investing.

1775
01:26:57,135 --> 01:26:58,937
- Hmm.
- Assisted living,

1776
01:26:59,071 --> 01:27:00,706
I hear that's your thing.

1777
01:27:01,739 --> 01:27:03,675
Yeah, I mean, well.

1778
01:27:04,143 --> 01:27:06,078
- I'm a transactional attorney.
- Oh.

1779
01:27:06,211 --> 01:27:08,548
So, yeah.

1780
01:27:09,613 --> 01:27:11,149
Could you help me with that?

1781
01:27:12,084 --> 01:27:12,984
Sure.

1782
01:27:13,684 --> 01:27:15,955
- That'd be really great.
- Okay.

1783
01:27:19,590 --> 01:27:20,692
Thank you.

1784
01:27:21,393 --> 01:27:22,261
Sure.

1785
01:27:23,461 --> 01:27:27,065
Did you know?
Napoleon used to be six-seven.

1786
01:27:27,532 --> 01:27:30,935
He lost his kneecaps
in a ballroom dancing accident

1787
01:27:31,069 --> 01:27:33,072
when he was a...
when he was a teenager.

1788
01:27:33,438 --> 01:27:35,773
And they clashed him down
about three feet.

1789
01:27:35,907 --> 01:27:37,143
- Wow.
- So.

1790
01:27:38,376 --> 01:27:41,312
Did you that LSD
was originally invented

1791
01:27:41,447 --> 01:27:42,815
to treat alcoholism?
