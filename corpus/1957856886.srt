- The middle of the kitchen.
- Cabinets over a...

97
00:04:39,266 --> 00:04:40,443

- Obstacles for ourselves.
- Yeah.

109
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:04,600
So, we just thought, "I
don't know, let them go off

110
00:05:04,734 --> 00:05:06,076

retreat without us.

that they still go.

00:05:10,533 --> 00:05:12,266
Yeah, it's not their fault.

114
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,433
Yeah, and we can't be in another
continent five time zones away

here that you booked

256

a two bedroom suite
for eight nights.

00:15:17,467 --> 00:15:20,133
I am Kayla, and I
paint pet portraits.

357
00:15:20,266 --> 00:15:22,133
And what's your name?
And where are you from?

358
00:15:22,266 --> 00:15:23,633
I don't think I've
met you before,

359
00:15:23,767 --> 00:15:25,076
because I would know you
if you were from town,

360
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,166
and who is this little cutie?

361
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,734
And how'd you get his
coat so darned shiny?

362
00:15:29,867 --> 00:15:31,033
You're coming in, right?

363
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:34,567
Oh, you know I would love to,

364
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,467
but we are in a bit of a rush.

365
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,633
I have to meet someone.

366
00:15:38,767 --> 00:15:40,333
Um...

367
00:15:40,467 --> 00:15:42,033
Over there.

368
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:45,200
Oh, darn. But hey,
maybe next time.

369
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,533
Great. Okay, bye.

370
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:49,500
Bye. Bye. Bye.

371
00:15:50,834 --> 00:15:52,100
(door closing)

372
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,166
And that is why the human leads.

373
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,576
So, there's really
no trick for the TV?

374
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,300
Not that I know of,

375
00:16:04,433 --> 00:16:07,066
but people don't usually come
here to watch television.

376
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,300
Well, no, of course.

377
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:09,993
I'm not here to watch
television either,

378
00:16:10,066 --> 00:16:12,100
I just, you know, like
it on in the background.

379
00:16:12,233 --> 00:16:15,033
Mm-hm. Well, we have a
VCR player in your room,

380
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,467
and we have some movies.

381
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,934
Mostly romantic comedies.

382
00:16:19,066 --> 00:16:20,600
Mm, okay. Um...

383
00:16:20,734 --> 00:16:22,409
I will take that reservation.
What time is that for?

384
00:16:22,433 --> 00:16:24,600
4:45 pm.

385
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,767
(laughing) For dinner?

386
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,300
If you want to eat
tonight, it is.

387
00:16:29,433 --> 00:16:31,767
Wow. Didn't know we
needed a reservation.

388
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,200
Reservation for what?

389
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:38,233
Ah, just the finest
restaurant in town. Here.

390
00:16:38,367 --> 00:16:40,100
I think I read that.

391
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:41,700
Yeah, you're hungry right? Yeah?

392
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,934
I mean, a little.

393
00:16:44,066 --> 00:16:46,934
Good, because we have a
reservation in 15 minutes.

394
00:16:47,066 --> 00:16:48,133
For dinner?

395
00:16:48,266 --> 00:16:49,433
Welcome to Gracious.

396
00:16:49,567 --> 00:16:50,767
(chuckling)

397
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,100
Okay.

398
00:16:53,233 --> 00:16:54,533
I'll bring Jerry upstairs.

399
00:16:54,667 --> 00:16:56,400
Okay, I'm going to
go get us a table.

400
00:16:56,533 --> 00:16:57,633
Come on.

401
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,333
See you at dinner.

402
00:17:04,734 --> 00:17:08,700
You ever get the feeling
you're being watched?

403
00:17:08,834 --> 00:17:10,767
By a creepy elf?

404
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,033
Or several.

405
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,700
I do now.

406
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:17,033
Hey...

407
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:18,533
Hey.

408
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,200
So, what looks good?

409
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,109
Well, actually, while you
were putting Jerry away,

410
00:17:24,133 --> 00:17:25,810
I took the liberty and
I ordered us dinner.

411
00:17:25,834 --> 00:17:27,667
I saw they had a
Beef Wellington,

412
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,100
but then I saw they had
a porterhouse for two.

413
00:17:31,233 --> 00:17:32,800
(laughing) You
ordered me a steak?

414
00:17:32,934 --> 00:17:34,000
Yeah.

415
00:17:34,133 --> 00:17:36,166
- Wait, really?
- What?

416
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,467
Robby, I stopped eating
meat three months ago.

417
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,600
You did?

418
00:17:40,667 --> 00:17:41,667
You knew that.

419
00:17:41,767 --> 00:17:43,467
Oh, clearly I did not.

420
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,476
- No, no. I told you.
- When? While I was asleep?

421
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,776
For three months
you hadn't noticed?

422
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,276
You know what? Your
observation skills

423
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,800
haven't been on point either.

424
00:17:49,934 --> 00:17:51,409
You didn't even notice that
I was gone for two days.

425
00:17:51,433 --> 00:17:52,500
No, I noticed.

426
00:17:52,633 --> 00:17:53,793
You noticed when I came home.

427
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,033
Well, you work late at night

428
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,443
and I'm gone early
in the morning.

429
00:17:56,467 --> 00:17:58,100
I can't keep track
of your schedule.

430
00:17:58,233 --> 00:18:00,567
Well, and I can't keep track
of your culinary preferences.

431
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:09,066
Look, you're right, oaky?

432
00:18:11,667 --> 00:18:15,667
I just remember when we
used to want to know, like,

433
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,266
everything about each other.

434
00:18:26,233 --> 00:18:27,633
(both laughing)

435
00:18:31,567 --> 00:18:32,934
Robby, what are we doing?

436
00:18:33,066 --> 00:18:37,333
We are trying to
have a lovely dinner.

437
00:18:37,467 --> 00:18:39,834
Neither of us wants to be here.

438
00:18:39,967 --> 00:18:42,166
Neither of us is happy.

439
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,133
Tell me, in your
heart, that I'm wrong.

440
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:48,667
What do you want to do?

441
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,834
Just feel like we've
tried everything.

00:18:50,967 --> 00:18:53,767
Keeping busy and working

443
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,867
and the remodel and
marriage coaching.

444
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,233
Nothing seems to work.

445
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:03,266
So, what are you saying, Becca?

446
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,100
I'm saying I think we need
to take some time apart.

447
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,433
Just to think.

448
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,667
Kay.

449
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,934
Robby, we can't get through
dinner without arguing.

450
00:19:18,066 --> 00:19:19,834
You're right. We should
try a separation.

451

it to get worse.

- Yeah?
- Yeah.

- Let's go home.
- Yeah.

455

00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,533
if you don't finish.

892
00:38:43,667 --> 00:38:45,233
You know, I do like to decorate.

893
00:38:45,367 --> 00:38:46,667
I know you do.

894
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,500
Here, you wanna do
mine? It'll be quicker.

895
00:38:48,633 --> 00:38:50,266
No, you do your own.

896
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,667
You got good ideas.
You're creative.

897
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,266
I am gonna use this, though.

898
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,600
(ticking)

899
00:39:01,734 --> 00:39:03,000
Okay.

900
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:06,166
Look at all of this bling.

901
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,100
With a little time to spare.

902
00:39:08,233 --> 00:39:10,743
You know, you got a little empty
real estate there on the bottom.

903
00:39:10,767 --> 00:39:11,900
Really?

904
00:39:12,033 --> 00:39:13,300
Yeah. Now, this.

905
00:39:13,433 --> 00:39:15,333
That's ridiculous. (laughing)

906
00:39:16,734 --> 00:39:17,800
(phones pinging)

907
00:39:17,934 --> 00:39:21,900
Both: Aww. They're at Le Souk.

908
00:39:22,033 --> 00:39:23,776
Marseilles, wasn't that
with the chicken "tageen."

909
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,934
Tagine.

910
00:39:25,066 --> 00:39:26,500
- Tagine?
- Yes.

911
00:39:26,633 --> 00:39:28,667
Actually, I remember
the fig mille-feuille

912
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,100
with sabayon cream.

913
00:39:30,233 --> 00:39:31,509
Yeah, how do you remember
the name of that?

914
00:39:31,533 --> 00:39:32,633
It was so good.

915
00:39:32,767 --> 00:39:34,209
Well, I remember you
ate half of mine.

916
00:39:34,233 --> 00:39:35,500
(laughing)

917
00:39:35,633 --> 00:39:37,009
Actually, I think I ate
mine and all of yours.

918
00:39:37,033 --> 00:39:38,443
But you said you
were happy to share.

919
00:39:38,467 --> 00:39:40,567
I was.

920
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,333
It was our third anniversary.

921
00:39:42,467 --> 00:39:44,667
I think we should
send them a picture.

922
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,133
Right now?

923
00:39:46,266 --> 00:39:47,800
We can't keep sending
pictures of Jerry

924
00:39:47,934 --> 00:39:49,467
or selfies of each one of us.

925
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,600
They're gonna, you know,
know something's going on.

926
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:54,100
Look, Becc, we're going to have
to tell them sooner or later.

927
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:56,166
I know.

928
00:39:56,300 --> 00:40:00,567
Just can it wait until
after Christmas? Okay?

929
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,934
Sure.

930
00:40:03,066 --> 00:40:04,900
Here.

931
00:40:05,033 --> 00:40:06,467
(clearing throat)

932
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,900
Alright, you ready?

933
00:40:08,033 --> 00:40:11,400
Yeah. It can't look forced okay?

934
00:40:11,533 --> 00:40:14,667
One, two, three.

935
00:40:16,266 --> 00:40:17,500
(camera snapping)

936
00:40:17,633 --> 00:40:19,100
Let's see.

937
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,834
It's good enough.

938
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,967
It really slipped your mind?

939
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,300
What?

940
00:40:33,433 --> 00:40:36,433
The whole secret souffle series?

941
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:40,633
No. I wanted to
bake a cake for you.

942
00:40:40,767 --> 00:40:43,767
In our brand new
kitchen at Christmas.

943
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,333
To surprise you.

944
00:40:47,867 --> 00:40:49,100
Really?

945
00:40:49,233 --> 00:40:51,233
Listen.

946
00:40:51,367 --> 00:40:55,700
I am consumed with work.

947
00:40:57,734 --> 00:41:00,800
I'm all wrapped up and I'm not
a good communicator anymore,

948
00:41:00,934 --> 00:41:03,233
and I don't listen to
you, and I am sorry.

949
00:41:05,633 --> 00:41:07,900
Me, too.

950
00:41:08,033 --> 00:41:10,734
I just wanted this Christmas
to be special for you.

951
00:41:10,867 --> 00:41:13,433
I wanted this Christmas
to be special for us.

952
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,867
(dinging)

953
00:41:21,867 --> 00:41:23,333
Time's up.

954
00:41:26,467 --> 00:41:27,900
Yeah.

955
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:35,667
- (barking)
- Come on.

956
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,300
(laughing) Look at this.

957
00:41:38,433 --> 00:41:39,934
It's beautiful.

958
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:45,834
(sighing) So, why do
I feel so sad, Jerry?

959
00:41:45,967 --> 00:41:48,700
I mean, this is crazy.

960
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,667
How did we get here?

961
00:41:53,433 --> 00:41:54,700
Me, Becca.

962
00:41:56,867 --> 00:41:58,142
I mean, yeah, there's
a ton of stuff

963
00:41:58,166 --> 00:41:59,509
that I could have
done differently,

964
00:41:59,533 --> 00:42:01,133
I know that, but...

965
00:42:02,867 --> 00:42:04,800
Oh, look at that.

966
00:42:04,934 --> 00:42:06,433
It's Santa Clause
and his reindeer.

967
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,367
What are we going
to do now, Jerry?

968
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:15,233
I know I sound nuts for
asking you for advice.

969
00:42:15,367 --> 00:42:17,133
Cindy: Yup.

970
00:42:17,266 --> 00:42:19,300
Thanks, Cindy.

971
00:42:19,433 --> 00:42:22,200
Hey, Cindy. How's it
going with the windshield?

972
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:24,000
It's going.

973
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,500
It's going, Jerry. It's going.

974
00:42:37,066 --> 00:42:39,533
Hey, Jerry.

975
00:42:39,667 --> 00:42:41,400
Come up here, boy.

976
00:42:41,533 --> 00:42:42,734
Come here.

(whining)

978
00:42:45,033 --> 00:42:48,934
Okay, I get it. It looks
really super comfy down there.

(Jerry whining)

980
00:42:51,734 --> 00:42:53,600
Just never thought we'd
end up here, you know?

981
00:42:56,533 --> 00:42:58,042
I mean, not that you
need to worry about it,

982
00:42:58,066 --> 00:42:59,300
'cause you don't.

983
00:43:01,834 --> 00:43:03,133

- Are we?
- Yeah.

00:45:26,767 --> 00:45:28,100
Where? For here?

1020
00:45:28,233 --> 00:45:29,900
Decorating is the
highlight every year.

Hi!

When Vince called, I
thought for sure you'd be

Look around. When you find
one you like, just holler.

1036
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,934
Okay. Sounds easy enough.

1037
00:46:15,066 --> 00:46:17,033
Here. I'll help you up.

1038
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:23,133
What are those trees over there?

1039
00:46:23,266 --> 00:46:24,767
Returns.

1040
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:27,367
You can't return
a tree, can you?

1041
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:31,433
No, but every so often,
someone cuts one down,

1042
00:46:31,567 --> 00:46:33,633
changes their mind, and bails.

1043
00:46:33,767 --> 00:46:35,133
Just leaves them there?

1044
00:46:38,066 --> 00:46:39,834
You want one of those
trees, don't you?

1045
00:46:39,967 --> 00:46:41,934
Well, we can't just leave
them there. It's sad.

1046
00:46:42,066 --> 00:46:43,633
It's a tree, Rebecca.

1047
00:46:43,767 --> 00:46:45,867
I know.

1048
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,367
They need us.

1049
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:57,500
I don't know why anyone would
have abandoned these trees.

1050
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,600
- They're perfect.
- I know!

1051
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:02,109
I can't believe Gabby threw
out all these ornaments.

1052
00:47:02,133 --> 00:47:03,767
Look at these cute alpacas.

1053
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,533
They are cute.

1054
00:47:05,667 --> 00:47:08,400
Hey, do you remember we used
to do a theme every year.

1055
00:47:08,533 --> 00:47:10,000
Oh, yeah.

1056
00:47:10,133 --> 00:47:11,810
All gold, all silver,
all ribbons, all bows.

1057
00:47:11,834 --> 00:47:13,934
It was very specific,
but very fun.

1058
00:47:14,066 --> 00:47:15,400
- It was fun.
- Mm-hm.

1059
00:47:15,533 --> 00:47:16,876
And I don't remember
why we stopped.

1060
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:19,333
Well, I do. Remember that year

1061
00:47:19,467 --> 00:47:20,876
it was your crazy
energy bar campaign

1062
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,767
and I had the even
crazier payroll drama?

1063
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:25,667
- Oh, yeah.
- Mm.

1064
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,700
We just never got
back into the flow.

1065
00:47:27,834 --> 00:47:31,400
Yeah, and now we have his
and her Christmas trees.

1066
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:35,767
Yeah.

1067
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:37,934
(whining)

1068
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,066
I think I'm going to go break
for some, uh, macaroons.

1069
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,333
Oh.

1070
00:47:47,467 --> 00:47:49,600
Do you want anything
from downstairs?

1071
00:47:49,734 --> 00:47:51,467
No.

1072
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:56,033
I mean, I gotta
email our guy about

1073
00:47:56,166 --> 00:47:57,609
the color of the
stain on the cabinets,

1074
00:47:57,633 --> 00:48:00,800
and I'll walk Jerry, and yeah.

1075
00:48:00,934 --> 00:48:02,934
We'll, uh... We'll
finish up later, yeah?

1076
00:48:03,066 --> 00:48:04,767
Yeah.

1077
00:48:06,066 --> 00:48:07,433
Okay.

1078
00:48:12,967 --> 00:48:14,834
(door closing)

1079
00:48:22,367 --> 00:48:24,433
So, I know you said to
choose the best one,

1080
00:48:24,567 --> 00:48:26,667
but I'm sorry, I love them all.

1081
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,500
(chuckling) That's okay.
The more the merrier.

1082
00:48:29,633 --> 00:48:31,266
So, is Robby coming down?

1083
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:34,266
No, he's busy picking out
the stains for our cabinets.

1084
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,840
Oh, do you want me
to put that to go?

1085
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:38,934
No, no. It's okay. He's got it.

1086
00:48:39,066 --> 00:48:40,576
So, you have me picking
out your macaroons,

1087
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,433
and your husband picking out...

1088
00:48:42,567 --> 00:48:45,800
Pretty much our entire kitchen.

1089
00:48:45,934 --> 00:48:47,300
It's kind of his thing.

1090
00:48:49,533 --> 00:48:51,233
What?

1091
00:48:51,367 --> 00:48:53,834
I just think that the kitchen
is the heart of the home.

1092
00:48:53,967 --> 00:48:56,600
Shouldn't that make it
both of your things?

1093
00:49:01,133 --> 00:49:02,776
Robby: Alright, are you
ready for a little walk?

1094
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,533
Come on, Jerry.
Come on. Come on.

1095
00:49:04,667 --> 00:49:06,367
Yeah, come on.

1096
00:49:07,967 --> 00:49:13,033
♪

1097
00:49:13,166 --> 00:49:16,533
Hey, Jerry! Where
are you going, buddy?

1098
00:49:16,667 --> 00:49:19,033
Hey! Come on. Jerry.

1099
00:49:19,166 --> 00:49:20,233
Robby?

1100
00:49:20,367 --> 00:49:21,900
Jerry!

1101
00:49:22,033 --> 00:49:23,467
Hey, what are you eating, buddy?

1102
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,800
Hey, there you are.

1103
00:49:25,934 --> 00:49:27,333
Hey.

1104
00:49:27,467 --> 00:49:30,000
I know that you said you
didn't want any macaroons,

1105
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,233
but it's Christmas,

1106
00:49:32,367 --> 00:49:33,700
and they have a
killer assortment.

1107
00:49:33,834 --> 00:49:36,367
Yeah? That's very sweet.
What are my options?

1108
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,533
Well, candy cane
was really good,

1109
00:49:38,667 --> 00:49:41,000
but the eggnog and
gingerbread was ridiculous.

1110
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:45,900
- (door slamming)
- (gasping)

1111
00:49:46,033 --> 00:49:47,367
(chuckling)

1112
00:49:50,967 --> 00:49:52,200
Is it locked?

1113
00:49:52,333 --> 00:49:55,567
(jiggling door)

1114
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:58,333
Am I the only one thinking
about creepy elves right now?

1115
00:49:58,467 --> 00:50:00,233
(laughing)

1116
00:50:06,433 --> 00:50:08,867
Help!

1117
00:50:10,433 --> 00:50:12,734
(knocking) Help!

1118
00:50:12,867 --> 00:50:14,867
Yeah, I don't think
anyone can hear you, baby.

1119
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,900
These windows are
double pane. (knocking)

1120
00:50:19,867 --> 00:50:21,700
Why aren't they
answering their phone?

1121
00:50:21,834 --> 00:50:23,834
Ah.

1122
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:27,467
Watch this.

1123
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,300
Mm-hm.

1124
00:50:29,433 --> 00:50:30,834
Okay.

1125
00:50:30,967 --> 00:50:32,567
Hm.

1126
00:50:35,867 --> 00:50:37,587
I should have gotten
you a MacGyver toolkit.

1127
00:50:37,633 --> 00:50:40,066
Uh, this is my MacGyver tool.

1128
00:50:41,867 --> 00:50:43,000
Hey, Robby?

1129
00:50:43,133 --> 00:50:44,500
Yeah?

1130
00:50:46,533 --> 00:50:48,233
I'm sorry about the remodel.

1131
00:50:48,367 --> 00:50:52,066
About assuming that you wanted
to do it all by yourself.

1132
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:55,000
Hey, it's okay. I like
doing it, you know?

1133
00:50:55,133 --> 00:50:56,567
Yeah, I know.

1134
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:01,433
Maybe you might have
wanted some input from me?

1135
00:51:01,567 --> 00:51:03,400
Uh...

1136
00:51:05,667 --> 00:51:07,000
I just assumed it'd be easier.

1137
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,567
You know?

1138
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:10,867
Hey, Rebecca.

1139
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,700
Mm-hm?

1140
00:51:12,834 --> 00:51:17,400
I'm sorry that I didn't listen
to you when you chimed in.

1141
00:51:17,533 --> 00:51:19,476
What I didn't realize was
that when you were chiming in

1142
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,740
at those moments, it was
because it was important to you.

1143
00:51:21,767 --> 00:51:25,133
Thank you. I appreciate that.

1144
00:51:25,266 --> 00:51:26,433
Yeah.

1145
00:51:26,567 --> 00:51:28,700
- (phone pinging)
- Oh!

1146
00:51:28,834 --> 00:51:30,633
- Aww!
- Hm?

1147
00:51:30,767 --> 00:51:32,734
Look, they went to
Domaine du Bagnol.

1148
00:51:32,867 --> 00:51:34,734
Judy loves her wine-tastings.

1149
00:51:34,867 --> 00:51:36,567
- Mm-hm.
- Hey, is that French Jerry?

1150
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:37,800
You think he's still alive?

1151
00:51:37,934 --> 00:51:39,734
- Look.
- Aww.

1152
00:51:39,867 --> 00:51:41,176
You know, he's not
as cute as our Jerry.

1153
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,734
Yeah. I'm glad
they're having fun.

1154
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:45,600
Oh, come on.

1155
00:51:45,734 --> 00:51:47,343
I feel bad about not being
there with them, though.

1156
00:51:47,367 --> 00:51:48,600
Ah! Got it!

1157
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,333
Rebecca... Whoa! (grunting)

1158
00:51:54,433 --> 00:51:55,300
I'm okay.

1159
00:51:55,433 --> 00:51:56,800
I thought I heard someone.

1160
00:51:56,934 --> 00:51:58,500
(scoffing)

1161
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,400
Robby: Thank you for
letting us do this.

1162
00:52:07,967 --> 00:52:09,600
So, I just feed it to them?

1163
00:52:09,734 --> 00:52:11,166
(bleating)

1164
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:13,867
Well, they're big raisin fans.

1165
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,300
We kind of thought that you
were, uh, going to do it.

1166
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:18,867
When the request comes
from out of town,

1167
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,200
but since you're here
and wanted to voice it,

1168
00:52:21,333 --> 00:52:23,000
it's all you, and you, too.

1169
00:52:23,133 --> 00:52:25,166
Ah, okay. Okay. Thank you.

1170
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:28,033
Well, they wanted pictures,
we're giving them alpacas.

1171
00:52:28,166 --> 00:52:30,500
Yeah, it'll make them
smile. Are we ready?

1172
00:52:30,633 --> 00:52:31,767
Yeah.

1173
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:33,300
Okay, action.

1174
00:52:33,433 --> 00:52:36,033
Robby & Rebecca: Hi,
Becca and Robby's parents.

1175
00:52:36,166 --> 00:52:39,367
Rebecca: The kids wanted us
to let you know that Christmas

1176
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,867
won't be the same without you.

1177
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,967
But they want you to
have an incredible time!

1178
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:46,633
Rebecca: Merry Christmas!

1179
00:52:46,767 --> 00:52:48,433
Je t'aime! Patch banane!

1180
00:52:48,567 --> 00:52:50,133
- (beeping)
- (laughing)

1181
00:52:50,266 --> 00:52:53,000
Did you just say, "I
love you, banana patch?"

1182
00:52:53,133 --> 00:52:54,693
No, I just said, "I
love you, have fun."

1183
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,960
I'm pretty sure you
said "banana patch."

1184
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,100
Mm.

1185
00:53:00,233 --> 00:53:01,700
It was "banana patch."

1186
00:53:04,867 --> 00:53:07,033
Geez. They nibbled me.

1187
00:53:07,166 --> 00:53:08,443
I mean, it's like a
cute little nibble,

1188
00:53:08,467 --> 00:53:09,834
but it's definitely a nibble.

1189
00:53:09,967 --> 00:53:13,567
Aww, he was hungry.

1190
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:15,600
And apparently so am I.

1191
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:17,600
Yeah, you know
it's after 5:00.

1192
00:53:17,734 --> 00:53:19,233
Oh.

1193
00:53:19,367 --> 00:53:21,400
Would you like to
have dinner with me?

1194
00:53:21,533 --> 00:53:24,066
Sit down, napkin on a lap.

1195
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,467
Like a date.

1196
00:53:27,233 --> 00:53:29,567
We've been married for 13
years, and I don't know why,

1197
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:32,100
I'm nervous asking you that.

1198
00:53:32,233 --> 00:53:34,834
Yeah. Yeah, that'd be nice.

1199
00:53:34,967 --> 00:53:39,200
After you.

1200
00:53:39,333 --> 00:53:40,567
No.

1201
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:43,200
(sighing)

1202
00:53:43,333 --> 00:53:44,934
No.

1203
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:52,200
Uh-huh. It's festive.

1204
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,467
Way too much. Way too much.

1205
00:54:06,367 --> 00:54:07,700
(sighing)

1206
00:54:18,633 --> 00:54:20,800
You look beautiful.

1207
00:54:20,934 --> 00:54:22,533
Thank you.

1208
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,467
It's just comfy.

1209
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:27,834
(chuckling)

1210
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,300
Shall we?

1211
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,533
(whining)

1212
00:54:39,367 --> 00:54:41,100
Kayla: They really
outdid themselves.

1213
00:54:41,233 --> 00:54:43,066
They did a great
job last year, too.

1214
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,967
I think that suit
might be cheating.

1215
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:48,967
I refuse to wear an
ill-fitted sweater,

1216
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:51,133
but I did bring the
ugly. Does this count?

1217
00:54:51,266 --> 00:54:52,600
Nice, next year I'm rocking

1218
00:54:52,734 --> 00:54:54,433
the handkerchief
instead of this.

1219
00:54:54,567 --> 00:54:56,300
Oh, you can pull anything off.

1220
00:54:56,433 --> 00:54:57,934
Are you flirting with me?

1221
00:55:01,133 --> 00:55:03,166
Ah, that's not a great start.

1222
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,700
Should we go somewhere else?

1223
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:05,967
Yeah.

1224
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:07,867
- Come in!
- Oh, hi.

1225
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,500
Oh, we can't crash
your holiday party.

1226
00:55:09,633 --> 00:55:11,753
It's our staff party, and
it's always open to friends.

1227
00:55:11,867 --> 00:55:12,967
Come on.

1228
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:14,867
We got martinis and you already

1229
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,900
got your ugly sweater
on, so come in.

1230
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:19,867
Are you talking to me?

1231
00:55:26,867 --> 00:55:28,333
Vince: Cheers!

1232
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,967
So, the Christmas parade.

1233
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:35,834
This is the biggest event
of the holidays around here?

1234
00:55:35,967 --> 00:55:37,500
Yeah, no one misses
it, man. No one.

1235
00:55:37,633 --> 00:55:39,300
Even our fur families come out.

1236
00:55:39,433 --> 00:55:42,133
It sounds like a huge
parade. I can't wait.

1237
00:55:42,266 --> 00:55:43,800
It really is quite the event.

1238
00:55:43,934 --> 00:55:45,476
I can't wait to see Rosie
in the parade tomorrow.

1239
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:48,633
Oh, would Jerry want
to ride with Rosie?

1240
00:55:48,767 --> 00:55:49,867
She would love the company.

1241
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,400
I mean...

1242
00:55:51,533 --> 00:55:52,776
Yeah, I mean, it would
be a cute picture.

1243
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,142
- Yeah.
