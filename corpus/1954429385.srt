00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,760
Sure. Gunner.
Hell, everybody knows you.

25
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,200
Yeah. How are you?

26
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,800
Have... a seat.

27
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,840
And you're, uh... um...

28
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,240
Willard Burns.

29
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,520
You're "Sonny" Burns.

30
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,840
Right? Yeah!

31
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,280
Right. That's what they called me.

32
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,560
Yeah. I remember you.

33
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,000
You're the photographer,
right?

34
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,720
Took pictures for
The Daily Echo.

35
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,320
Yeah, just sports stuff,
you know.

36
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,240
You might've seen it.
Actually, I got...

37
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,160
There was one of you
in particular.

38
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,480
It was in...
You were scoring in the Southport game.

39
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,360
Right. I remember that.
That's a great picture.

40
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,840
Yeah. Action stuff, Right?

41
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,720
Damn good, too.
Damn good stuff.

42
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,720
Yeah. This is great,
running into you.

43
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,720
Oh, yeah?

44
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,360
Yeah. As a matter
of fact, I've been...

45
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,920
Well, I've been doing a little
photography myself.

46
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,960
I picked me up a Nikon
over in Japan and...

47
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,680
I mean, I'm not worth
a damn yet...

48
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,760
post card shots
and tourist crap...

49
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,240
but I wanna learn.
Here you go.

50
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,400
Oh, thank you.

51
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,360
Sure.

52
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,920
So, um...

53
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,880
Korea, huh?
You must've seen some combat.

54
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,960
Mmm. Yeah.

55
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,800
You know, I caught a little shrapnel
in the ass is all.

56
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,160
Yeah. I didn't...
you know, I didn't really, uh...

57
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,560
Got stuck in Kansas City.
Public Information.

58
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,000
Good conduct.

59
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,600
Well, hey, you know, somebody's
gotta hold down the fort, right?

60
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,120
Exactly. That'd be me.

61
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,720
You know what? There's really only
one thing you missed.

62
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,840
Yeah? What's that?

63
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,440
Japan.

64
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,120
Yeah? Yeah?

65
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,560
You really liked it, huh?

66
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,280
Oh, God.
I mean, it...

67
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,360
it changed
my whole approach.

68
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,200
Right. Sure. To what?

69
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,080
Everything, you know?
You name it.

70
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,000
I mean, I never really...

71
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,720
Hell, I never really thought
about anything before I went to Japan.

72
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,960
I mean, in college,
I memorized stuff,

73
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,960
but I mean really think, you know?
Question.

74
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,880
I mean, take your
Zen Buddhism, OK?

75
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,640
- Okay.
- They got these riddles,

76
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,880
and they really make you think about
things differently.

77
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,640
Do you know any zen?

78
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,720
Uh... well, I had
some sukiyaki once.

79
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,880
You know...
in Chicago.

80
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,120
Well, uh...

81
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,840
you ever have
any sake?

82
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,560
Um,

83
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,600
not that I know of.

84
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,800
Did you play
any sports at all?

85
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,040
No. I always wanted to...

86
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,160
Ha ha ha!

87
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,360
Hey, at least you
didn't get arrested.

88
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,400
Hey, at least you got your fingers
worked out, huh?

89
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,560
Fuck it.
Maybe you'll never return.

90
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,640
- Cheers.
- Ha ha ha!

91
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,360
Last stop!
Indianapolis!

92
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,920
Feel like I got
hit by a truck.

93
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,280
You know, uh...

94
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,160
we should get together some time, huh?
No shit.

95
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,960
Yeah, that'd be great.
Fantastic.

96
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,400
You got a lift home?

97
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,600
Yeah. Yeah, I think...
my mother's picking me up.

98
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,240
Christ died for our sins!

99
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,120
Communism is the religion
of failures!

100
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,880
Christ died for our sins!

101
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,920
Communism is the religion
of failures!

102
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,760
Gunner!

103
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,160
Hey, see you later,
all right?

104
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,280
All right.

105
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,360
Gunner!

106
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,560
Gunner! Oh!

107
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,120
Gunner!

108
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,760
Ha ha ha!

109
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,360
There he is! Sonny!

110
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,160
Oh, it's Sonny!

111
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,160
Sonny! Sonny!

112
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,200
Oh! You're home!

113
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,920
Oh, You're home.

114
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,800
Welcome home, son.

115
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,760
Thank you, sir.

116
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,200
We thank you, oh, Lord,

117
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,800
for protecting this dear child

118
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,560
and for bringing
him home safe...

119
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,000
from the horrors of war.

120
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,000
Mother, I was only in Kansas City.

121
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,240
There's danger everywhere.

122
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,800
We're in a "no parking"zone, folks.

123
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,840
Elwood. Your father...
such a worry wart.

124
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,240
Come on.

125
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,600
Oh, I almost forgot.
We have a surprise for you.

126
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,200
What's the surprise?

127
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,920
Well, it's not a surprise
if I tell you.

128
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,160
Come on1

129
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,800
Surprise! Ha ha!

130
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,800
Hello!

131
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,000
There she is!

132
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,280
Welcome home!

133
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,160
Give your best girl a kiss.

134
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,040
Sonny?

135
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,040
Got you a little treat,
honey.

136
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,000
Sweet dreams.

137
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,360
Fuck you, God.

138
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,760
Come here, Sonny.

139
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,760
Come on, Sonny,
take my picture.

140
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,200
Come here, you war hero.

141
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,760
Come here...

142
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:58,600
Mmm... tastes good.

143
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,000
Well, I think
he'd feel better...

144
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,760
if he got up
before noon.

145
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,680
He deserves a rest...

146
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,880
after fighting for his country
for 2 long years.

147
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,480
He's been home 3 days,

148
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,040
and he hasn't been out of
the house.

149
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,000
Well.

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,480

Hey! Hi! Absolutely.

Great. Yeah. Bye.

I don't see it
that way, you know?

175
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,400
To me, all those years,
it's like, wasted.

176
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,240
All that time, it just seems like
it was flushed away...

177
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,960
jockin' around and acting like
I knew it all...

178
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,120
and being a big rod and...

179
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,360
I must've seemed
like a real asshole.

180
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,560
Oh, you know...

181
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,760
That's all right.

182
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,760
Hell, I get to thinking how
I was back then...

183
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,640
It's embarrassing,
you know what I mean?

184
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,320
Really, there were a lot of times when
I felt like, myself...

185
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,800
Lock up the women and children!
Gunner!

186
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,720
Hey, you old cocksman!

187
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,640
You old jocks can still
hit the ball, huh?

188
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,880
Shit, man.
We're 5-2, and leading the league.

189
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,560
Ha ha ha!

190
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,400
You guys remember
Sonny Burns.

191
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,680
Hi.

192
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,760
Sonny, you know this bunch
of muff divers.

193
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,680
You got Wilks Wilkerson,
Jocko Biemer...

194
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,240
Russ, hey, let's get another round
for the boys.

195
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,840
Please and thank you, huh?

196
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,240
So, Guns, you still blankin'
Deedee Armbruster?

197
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,840
Hey, be careful, Gun.

198
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,400
She'll make an honest man
out of you.

199
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,600
No. The old cocksman is not ready
to pack it in yet.

200
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,400
So, I heard Shins tied the knot, huh?

201
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,840
You mean, "Pops" Shins?

202
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,680
Oh, no!

203
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,400
Patsy already dropped
a bambino for him.

204
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,640
Hey, Guns, we need a good man
on the mound.

205
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,680
How's the old wing?

206
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,720
Yeah, how about it?

207
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,240
Don't you worry
about the old wing.

208
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,360
Yeah? All right!

209
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,640
The old Gunner's back!

210
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,160
Gunner! Gunner! Gunner! Gunner!

211
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,840
All I wanna know is...

212
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:33,720
what the hell was I doing hanging out
with a loser like Sonny Burns?

213
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,840
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

214
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,960
Whoo-hoo! Aah!

215
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Sonny!

216
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,440
Yeah? Hey.

217
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,880
Where you going?

218
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,800
Oh, I don't know.
I just thought you might...

219
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,880
You know, you haven't seen
these guys...

220
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,000
I don't feel like shootin' the shit
with those guys right now.

221
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,280
- Let's get outta here.
- Yeah?

222
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,840
Hey, you guys
still out here, huh?

223
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,120
Welcome home,
Guns, baby.

224
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,080
How you doin'?

225
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,720
Oh, these two look good.

226
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,920
All right, war hero.

227
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,480
Why don't you stop loafing
and get a job

228
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,400
instead of hanging out
in front of my house?

229
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,120
Nina... I'm home!

230
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,920
Yeah, that was that
Southport game.

231
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,680
Did you take that picture?

232
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,760
I... I don't know.

233
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,080
Nina loves that picture.

234
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,040
That's a 67...

235
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,040
Speak of the devil.

236
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,880
Hi, Nina.

237
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,400
Hi, darling!

238
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,400
Oh... sweetheart.

239
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,600
How are you?

240
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,160
Good. I want you to meet my friend,
Sonny Burns.

241
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,920
Sonny, this is my mother, Nina.

242
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,760
Very pleased to meet you,
Mrs. Casselman.

243
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,840
Hmm. Well, you fellas
want a drink?

244
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,480
Uh, no. I was just gonna get me
and Sonny a beer.

245
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,400
It's a very nice apartment
you have here, Mrs. Casselman.

246
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,920
Nina.

247
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,040
Oh, it's suits me fine,
bachelor girl like myself.

248
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,000
Sit down.

249
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,240
I haven't seen
you before.

250
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,280
What'd you say your name
was again?

251
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,960
Willard Burns.

252
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,600
That's Sonny Burns.
He went to Shortly.

253
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,880
I know all the gang from Shortly.

254
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,600
I haven't heard
of him before.

255
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,520
Well, nobody did,
really.

256
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,480
Why not?

257
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,280
Well, I didn't do much.

258
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,880
Oh, hell yes, he did.

259
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,440
Sonny was an ace photographer
for the Echo.

260
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,320
He was the same for the paper
up at I.U.

261
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,920
Oh. I.U.?

262
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,520
What house were you in?

263
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,640
Uh, the rooming house.

264
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,280
Ha ha ha! The rooming house.
That's good.

265
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,960
That's funny.

266
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:18,040
Well, I guess I just don't
get the joke.

267
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,880
Well, I'm gonna give Sonny
a lift home.

268
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,360
I hope you're not forgetting
about tonight, Gunner.

269
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,960
No, Nina.

270
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,480
I broke 2 dates to be with you
tonight, sweetie.

271
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,720
Not that I wouldn't
rather be with you.

272
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,560
I want you to show
Nina a good time.

273
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,640
All right.
We'll paint the town, Nina.

274
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,560
Come here.
Give me a kiss.

275
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,680
Come on.

276
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,360
Mmm! I love you.

277
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,440

00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,240
Do we have sausage or bacon and eggs
or anything?

289
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,800
That's not what you
like in the morning.

290
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,320
Your stomach is too delicate
for greasy things.

291
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,120
Did you have a nice time
with your new friend?

292
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,080
Mm-hmm.

293
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,240
Does your new friend
make it a habit...

294
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,920
of going to bars in the middle
of the afternoon?

295
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,280
So what if he does? So what if he
goes to bars in the morning?

296
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,840
Don't yell at me.
No need to yell at me.

00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,280
I'm not yelling.

00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,440
I just asked what business
is it of yours...

300
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,680
what Gunner Casselman does?

301
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,200
It's my business
what happens to my son.

302
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,680
It's really none
of your damn business, Mother.

303
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,120
And for your information,
he's a great guy.

00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,480

00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,760

306
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,000
you come up with fleas.

I'm losing my mind...

308

for The Daily...

313
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,400

I never... you know...

320
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,480
I never observed anything.

321
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,840
I never looked
at anything...

322
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,240
and questioned it,
you know?

323
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,800
At least not till
I got to Japan.

324
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,320
And only then, I think, 'cause I was...
I was an outsider.

325
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,640
You know? I was a real outsider
for the first time.

326
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,480
And I realized that I didn't know shit
about my own society.

327
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,720
I just accepted it.

328
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,240
That's when I wanted to learn
how to start taking pictures...

329
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,760
Learn how to see.

330
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,680
You already got that.
You're...

331
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,880
You know, it's like
you were born with it.

332
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,240
This is... so good.

333
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,800
I don't know.
I guess... thanks.

334
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,320
You're very kind.
I guess I'm just lucky that way.

335
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,560
No. That's... that's not lucky.
That's good.

336
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,240
Okay, I got it!

337
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,320
We are choppin' in tall cotton tonight,
my man, oh, yeah.

338
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,800
Nina's got a date
for the races...

339
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,360
Saturday night
at Churchill Downs.

340
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,640
She'll be in Louisville.

341
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,800
We're gonna have the place
to ourselves.

342
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,920
Oh, ho-ho!

343
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,920
Think you can line up a hot one
for tonight?

344
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,200
I... yeah.

345
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,160
- Yeah?
- Sure.

346
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,200
Good. I figure one of us gets
the couch.

347
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,920
The other one gets the bedroom...
or the red room...

348
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,120
Have us a regular
fuck-a-thon.

349
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,400
What do you say?

350
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,480
You say "yes"
is what you say.

351
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,440
Yes.

352
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,960
Oh... I actually got
this little drink theory here, OK?

353
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,520
It's called the secret
of the sea breeze.

354
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,080
Now, these are the girls' drinks,
all right?

355
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,000
Now, the secret is...

356
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,600
they can't taste
the vodka

357
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:23,120
because it's mostly grapefruit,
understand?

358
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,200
It tastes like nothing,
you know?

359
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,480
Sonny...

360
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,440
Hi.

361
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,360
I love this one
of the monument.

362
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,480
Thank you very much.

363
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,720
The way you get the line
of the shadow...

364
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,840
That's a masterpiece.

365
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,800
It's really good.

366
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,920
Very kind of you.

367
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,720
Sonny, that looks just like
the monument.

368
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,680
You know, Buddy...

369
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,920
Great art, it sneaks up on you.

370
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,600
You have to let it soak in
a little bit, study it.

371
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,520
Right, yeah. Yeah.

372
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,720
Do you know, uh,
Gunner learned zen in japan.

373
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,440
Oh. That's not all he learned.

374
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,200
I love you, Sonny.

375
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,480
Me, too.

376
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,840
What are you talking about?

377
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,080
I don't wanna
be like some teenager...

378
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,320
parking and making out
at a golf course.

379
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,880
This look like a goddamn
golf course?

380
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,880
We're still hiding out.

381
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,920
Well, where do
you wanna do it?

382
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,040
In my own house.

383
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,680
In your own house.
Well, that's great.

384
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,280
With your parents upstairs?

385
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,520
I mean, my own house.

386
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,920
Goddamn it.
I wanna get married.

387
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,840
Gunner, my mother was 22
when she had me.

388
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:16,360
I'm almost 23 years old,
for God's sake.

389
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,800
It's time for me
to have kids.

390
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,480
I want a family.

391
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,720
Deedee, you know...

392
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,840
I just got home, you know?

393
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,840
I don't even know
what I wanna do yet.

394
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,560
Here, you want a puff of that?

395
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:45,480
I want children...
more than anything in the world.

396
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,760
You know that.

397
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,240
You're an adult, Gunner.

398
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,840
What are you waiting for?

399
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,400
Deed's,

400
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,320
I don't know much right now.
I just...

401
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,880
The only thing
I know is...

402
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,800
I love to do it
with you,

403
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:06,960
and you like it,
and I like it.

404
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,800
So come on...
let's do it.

405
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,920
Oh, I love you, Sonny.

406
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,880
Me, too.

407
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,520
I feel sorry for Deedee.

408
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,520
How come?

409
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,760
He's never going
to marry her.

410
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,240
She was just
his girlfriend...

411
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,160
in high school,
that's all.

412
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,760
You know, it's not...

413
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,000
Is that what I am?

414
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,000
What?

415
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,400
What do you
want me to say?

416
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,320
What would you
like me to say?

417
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,720
Nothing. I would just like to know
what your plans are.

418
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,600
I don't know!
I don't... I don't...

419
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,760
I don't... I...

420
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,800
I don't want anything.

421
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,240
OK, I won't ask.

422
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,160
'Cause every time I ask,

423
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,120
it turns into this.

424
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,080
No, no.

425
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,920
I mean, I don't...
I don't...

426
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,840
All right.

427
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,040
I don't even know.

428
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,080
Don't be angry, OK?

429
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,160
I'm not.

430
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,160
Will you call me?

431
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,600
Yeah, I'll call you.

432
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,640
Will you?

433
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,360
Yes, yes, I will.

434
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,480
I will call you,
I will.

435
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,880
I'll call you
on the phone...

436
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,120
OK, fine, all right.

437
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,080
I will.

438
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,320
I'm sorry.

439
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,760
I'll call you.

440
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,840
Sonny?

441
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,560
It's like
this deep new book I'm reading...

442
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,160
Called A Lonely Crowd,
right?

443
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,560
And I'm realizing that I've always
been kind of...

444
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,920
more of an outer
directed guy, right?

445
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,880
Right.

446
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,160
And now as
time goes on,

447
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,000
I'm kind of becoming
more inner directed...

448
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,920
and not giving
a shit so much...

449
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,240
what the crowd think.

450
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,040
You mean what
the lonely crowd thinks?

451
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,200
Hell, any crowd.

452
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,080
They're all lonely,
you know that.

453
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,320
You've always
been kind of more...

454
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,920
of an inner directed
guy, right?

455
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,680
Um, well, um,

456
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,600

00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,680

It's something...
something extra.

00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,120
She was a couple
years behind us.

541
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,480
Yeah, I went to Shortly, too.

542
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,960
But I don't think
we actually met.

543
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,400
But then
we wouldn't have,

544
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,320
You being a big rod
and all.

545
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,840
Isn't that what they
called you golden boys?

546
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,120
Oh, well, you know,

547
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,560
that was high school.

548
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,000
And college, too.

549
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,920
Depauw, wasn't it?

550
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,120
Football star,
big man on campus,

551
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,880
B.M.O.C.

552
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,040
So, you went, uh...

553
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,960
You went back east
to college?

554
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,560
Uh-huh. And I'm going to go back

555
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,520
and live there.

556
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,480
Really? Uh, when?

557
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,160
Oh, when I serve
my time here.

558
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,920
Well, daddy would
let me go now.

559
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,520
But mother thinks
if I stay here,

560
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,080
I'll meet a nice Jewish boy
at the country club,

561
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,640
get married,
and grow up to bejust like her.

562
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:55,160
So, I'm taking courses
at Harrod and painting.

563
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,080
If I can hack it for a year,

564
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,680
I get my freedom.

565
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,280
Ayear from now,

566
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,880
I'll be gone.

567
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,120
Where are you going?

568
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,160
Well, New York, of course.

569
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,600
Sure.

570
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,200
- Sure.
- Yeah, I mean, you know.

571
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,480
Is there any place else?

572
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,440
No, absolutely not.

573
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,800
No, I meant what
part of New York?

574
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,640
You know,
I actually, uh...

575
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,040
Well, I may be heading there myself,

576
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,640
as a matter of fact,

577
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:23,600
to do some studying
on the G.I. Bill.

578
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,920
Oh.

579
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,360
What would you study?

580
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,080
Well, you know...

581
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,040
philosophy maybe.

582
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,240
Philos...

583
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,200
Philosophy.

584
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,880
Or, uh...

585
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,320
Well, or...

586
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,280
art.

587
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,240
Art, yeah.

588
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,680
You know, I figure art.

589
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,960
Probably something,
you know,

590
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,560
something to do with,
you know, art.

591
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,520
Art.

592
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:51,080
Well, I've got to run.

593
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,520
Oh, thanks for
the coffee.

594
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,080
Did she leave?

595
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,400
Marty.

596
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,320
Hold on a second.

597
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,200
Hold on there
for a second.

598
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,640
Listen, I was, uh...

599
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,560
Well, I was thinking
maybe, you know,

600
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,760
we could get together
sometime, you know.

601
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,280
'Cause, uh...

602
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,880
Because I...

603
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,760
I want to talk to you
about some stuff.

604
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,920
You know, I was thinking
we could get together...

605
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,840
and talk about some, uh...

606
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,040
some... stuff.

607
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,120
Like what?

608
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,480
Well, uh...

609
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,960
OK, would you at least
give me your phone number?

610
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,560
It's in the book.

611
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,480
You all right?

612
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,920
Did you twist your ankle?

613
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,880
No, my ankle's fine.

614
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,640
I just got such
a goddamn hard-on,

615
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,760
I can barely walk.

616
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,720
Yeah, she's...

617
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,280
I don't even
know what she is.

618
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,560
She's something else.

619
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,120
She just thinks
I'm a dumb jock.

620
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,400
Oh, no, really?

621
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,360
You think?

622
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,840
Why don't you tell her
about zen and that stuff?

623
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,760
You know,
take her to see some art.

624
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,840
I don't know shit
about art, OK?

625
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,440
Oh, really,
really, you do.

626
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,360
You know,
you look like you do.

627
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,800
You know how
to stand and...

628
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,240
What happened to us?

629
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,160
I thought we came down here

630
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,600
to improve our minds, right?

631
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,520
We were going to
see some real art.

632
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,360
Wasn't that the idea?

633
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:03,120
I guess even art
leads to pussy.

634
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,480
I guess.

635
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,360
Come on, man, let's go.

636
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,200
Sonny, I want you to meet...

637
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,480
a wonderful man.

638
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,080
Happy to meet you, son.

639
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,360
I'm Luke Matthews.

640
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,760
Mr. Matthews
wrote a book.

641
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,080
Well, I'm going to leave you
two alone...

642
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,520
for a little while.

643
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,960
I've got to run.

644
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,760
"Matthews is a pseudonym...

645
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,680
for a hardened convict...

646
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,560
who found god
on a prison rock pile."

647
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,000
Mr. Matthews,

648
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,360
I believe there's been
a misunderstanding.

649
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,280
What's that?

650
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,440
That is my mother.

651
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,840
Your mother understands
that you were troubled,

652
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,080
and she wishes
to help you.

653
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,840
My mother does
not understand...

654
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,240
that I'm sick of
hearing about God.

655
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,320
I don't believe in God.

656
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,240
And frankly,
I don't even like the guy.

657
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,640
Well, you can't
dislike something...

658
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,520
or somebody that doesn't exist,
can you?

659
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,840
Mr. Matthews,
I think I just need to...

660
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,560
I need to figure some things out
for myself.

661
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,160
Yes, but at your age,

662
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,600
you need to be watchful.

663
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,320
We can come under the influence
of magnetic people,

664
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,880
and not realize they may walk
in evil ways...

665
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,240
and take others with them
on the downward path.

666
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,000
Are you talking about
Gunner Casselman?

667
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,600
Is that who you're talking about?

668
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,040
Because...
Is that right?

669
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,440
Because if you're talking
about Gunner Casselman,

670
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,360
he happens to be
a good friend of mine.

671
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,320
He's great.

672
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,080
He's a good friend.

673
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,480
And I believe
I'm at an age now, sir,

674
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,560
where I can begin
to pick my own friends.

675
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,480
And frankly, if I want to hang out
with Lucky Lucciano,

676
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,640
I will, sir.

677
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:59,000
The ways of evil may seem glamorous
at first,

678
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:03,480
until you view them from inside prison
bars as I have.

679
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,280
Mr. Matthews,

680
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:11,640
I'm really glad that you're out
on bail... parole.

681
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,040
You did your time
or whatever.

682
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:18,840
But I think I need
to lead my own damn life.

683
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,000
You're at a turning point, son.

684
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,440
Then I'll make
the goddamn turn myself.

685
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,520
- Yeah, so I'm trying
to snow her, right?

686
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,480
With a bunch of
intellectual shit.

687
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,560
Right, right.

688
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,520
And she keeps shooting me down,
you know?

689
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,080
And every once in a while,

690
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,080
she's yawning, OK?

691
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,040
Ha ha ha ha!

692
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,600
And she's really
pissing me off.

693
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,840
Finally she makes
this crack...

694
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,080
about how boring people are
in the Midwest.

695
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,040
I just flipped
my lid right there.

696
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,480
I couldn't take it anymore.

697
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,400
I just said exactly
what I thought,

698
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,600
not giving a shit
if she liked it or not.

699
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,360
Absolutely. What'd you say?
What'd you say?

700
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,120
I just looked right
at her and I said,

701
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,600
"Hey, look, bitch,

702
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:26,960
maybe I didn't go
to school back east, OK?

703
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,200
And I'm no egghead.

704
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,280
And maybe I am
just a dumb jock.

705
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,240
But I know a few things...

706
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,200
you don't know.

707
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,000
Like I know how to fuck you.

708
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,800
And I know you want it too."

709
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,240
Yeah, so what...

710
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:41,760
What did she say?

711
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,960
She was jelly.

712
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,320
Jelly.

713
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:49,280
Oh, goddamn it!

714
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:52,200
Is this
in the Jewish style?

715
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,800
What?

716
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,600
Well, I'm not
really familiar...

717
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,400
with this style
of painting.

718
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,840
So, I naturally assumed...

719
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,760
that since you're
taking lessons...

720
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:04,800
from that little
Jewish girl...

721
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,000
You know what, Mother?

722
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,680
You don't have to keep saying
Jewish all the time.

723
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,120
You can just
call her Marty.

724
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,080
That's her name.

725
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,680
Does it bother you
that she's Jewish?

726
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,400
No, Mother.

727
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,040
It bothers you.

728
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:20,400
Are you accusing Nina
of prejudice?

729
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,880
I'm not accusing
anybody of anything.

730
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,720
I should probably...
I'll just...

731
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,200
You know,
I never made a peep...

732
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,040
when you took out
those little Jewesses...

733
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,040
in high school.

734
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,640
I'm as broad-minded
as the next person.

735
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,800
But this is
a different story now.

736
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,960
Why is that?

737
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,040
Because you are a man now.

738
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,840
You are at an age...

739
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,480
when any girl might be
a potential wife.

740
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:44,800
And you know that!

741
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,360
Don't you play dumb with me!

742
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:47,400
I'm not.

743
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:50,320
You're not going
to marry her?

744
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,720
No, I'm not playing dumb.

745
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,120
You are going
to marry her?

746
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,560
That's what
you're saying?

747
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,000
You are telling me...

748
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,600
that you intend to
marry a Jewish girl?

749
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,320
What if I am?

750
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,720
Don't you know
what it means...

751
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,640
to marry a Jewish girl?

752
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,960
Don't you know what they have to do
before the wedding?

753
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,400
No, what?

754
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,360
The father,

755
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,720
the night before
the wedding,

756
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,600
he does it with
his own daughter.

757
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,160
It's part of
the Jew religion.

758
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,240
They... they...
they make them do that.

759
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,840
Mother, where did you hear that?

760
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,000
How did you come by
that little nugget?

761
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,680
It's common knowledge!

762
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,840
Oh, God!

763
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:40,720
The thing to do is just concentrate
on your art, right?

764
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,160
Forget all the bullshit.

765
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,000
Yeah.

766
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:49,320
Fucking "A."

767
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,200
Just concentrate
on your art.

768
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,280
Oh, Sonny.

769
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:15,880
You're terrific.

770
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,800
You really do
know about art.

771
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:20,040
Oh, you're the art, baby.

772
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,440
Did you forget the camp
pine tree pledge?

773
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,920
A pine tree man never ever
betrays another camper.

774
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:43,160
"And it came to pass...

775
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:46,040
when Onan went in unto
his brother's wife,

776
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:49,720
and had spilled his seed
upon the ground."

777
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:54,520
Genesis 38,
verses 4 through 10.

778
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:58,400
"And the Lord slew Onan...

779
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,160
when he spilled his seed."

780
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,160
My poor boy,

781
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,560
now you must be strong.

782
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,000
Stay strong.

783
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,280
Oh, Lord,

784
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:13,240
would you look down
upon this...

785
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,080
this fine young man...

786
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:17,080
in his time of trouble...

787
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,520
and help him,

788
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:20,960
help him to learn the way?

789
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,000
The true way.

790
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,280
Mr. Matthews?

791
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,680
Yes, son?

792
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,080
I was just wondering...

793
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,960
why the hell
you're in my room.

794
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:35,560
Your mother
has offered me...

795
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,120
the hospitality
of your home.

796
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,000
And I'm just here...

797
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:43,440
to do whatever
it is you need.

798
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,320
OK, son?

799
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,160
Well, good night.

800
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:54,000
Good night.

801
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,680
What are you doing?

802
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,080
I'm just throwing away...

803
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,680
some old kids games.

804
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,440
Oh, Sonny.

805
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,200
This might be something
you ought to save...

806
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,640
for your own kids.

807
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,080
I don't have any kids, Mother.

808
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:29,280
You will if you marry
the right girl,

809
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,400
settle down.

810
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:47,240

eternal soul.

Where you going?

830
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,040
Well, Harry Stapler's
taking me...

831
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:32,480
to the Brown County Fair.

832
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,400
I just came by
to say hello.

833
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,120
Are you seeing him
all the time now?

834
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,680
Well, I could see you
on Saturday night...

835
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,600
if you want to.

836
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,520
That would be good, sure.

837
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,120
We could do something...

838
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,880
somewhere if you want.

839
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,320

00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:55,680

Am I serious about Marty?

845
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,400
I don't know.

846
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,840
What does that mean?

847
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,760
I like to fuck her,

848
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,680
and I like to talk to her.

849
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,120

That about clinches it for me.

853

It's Columbia
and the G.I. Bill now,

Marty's mother
is all over her...

860
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,760
For seeing
Asheiguhtz.

861
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:50,640
And Nina won't quit
with her Jewish remarks.

862
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,560
Such a load of shit.

863
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,440
Whatever happened with that ad agency
offer...

864
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,360
you had in Chicago?

865
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,280
I didn't tell you?

866
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:01,200
I flunked
the personality test.

867
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,320
You're shitting me.

868
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,280
No.

869
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:04,560
How'd that happen?

870
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,480
Well, they send you
this test in the mail, right?

871
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:07,920
And in one part of it...

872
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,840
you're supposed to draw
a picture of yourself.

873
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,720
So, I drew a picture of me,
you know, casual,

874
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,120
drink in one hand,
other hand in the pocket.

875
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,040
The psychiatrist
who graded the test said...

876
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:20,400
it showed a tendency toward
alcoholism and masturbation.

877
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,760
You believe that shit?

878
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,640
I guess I'll never make it...

879
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,560
in the ad world, either.

880
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:28,520
Ahh.

881
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:30,920
Fuck 'em.

882
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,760
I'm heading to New York.

883
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,320
Greenwich Village.

884
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:57,800
All you got to do
is get the G.I. Bill.

885
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,560
Why don't you come with me?

886
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,240
New fucking York.

887
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:23,160
Oh, hey, man,

888
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:24,600
I forgot to tell you.

889
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:26,520
Marty has this friend
who's coming down...

890
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,440
that she went
to college with...

891
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:29,640
who's apparently,
you know,

892
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:30,840
pretty hot to trot.

893
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,280
And Marty was thinking...

894
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:34,200
that we could fix you up
with her...

895
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:38,000
for that big dinner dance
saturday night.

896
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:39,480
Want to go?

897
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:41,400
Uh, sure.

898
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,320
You know, I mean, who knows?

899
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:44,280
Lightning could strike.

900
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:45,240
You could get laid.

901
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,640
Crazier things
have happened.

902

Yeah.

979
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:08,560
So I plow through...
I grind to the end, you know,

980
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:10,520
and by then I'm
holding my breath...

981
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:12,440
as C.C. Waddles
to the front of the room, right?

982
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,360
And he stands right
next to Itchy,

983
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:15,800
and I look at him
and he looks at me,

984
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,720
and he waits about
a year and a half, right?

985
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:20,680
I had no idea what to do.
I'm horrified at this point.

986
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:22,920
So finally, he looks
at me and he says,

987
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,960
"Mr. Burns!"

988
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,760

Ahh!

1015
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:49,480
They just don't understand
Catcher In The Rye, you know?

1016
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:51,080
I think
what bothers them...

1017
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:54,000
what bothers them is that they know
that what Holden is trying to do...

1018
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:55,440
is he's trying
to break through...

1019
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:58,800
this accepted, unquestioned,
adult existence, you know.

1020
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:00,240
And to get...
Excuse me, Gale...

1021
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:03,240
Uh, and, um,
get to a place...

1022
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:06,400
beyond where he can be...
he can be Holden and be accepted,

1023
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,760
And... and not have the... the corruption
and disillusionment...

1024
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:12,160
th-th-th-that just...
that seems inevitable, you know.

1025
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,560
Sometimes I... I wonder
if we'll wake up one day...

1026
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:18,880
and... and won't be
like holden anymore, you know.

you're looking for.

1363
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:18,480

should die?

on the past, OK?

1372
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:48,520
OK?

01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:55,800

1375
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:01,120
Of course,
she wanted to be here,

1376
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:03,040
but I thought
you needed your rest,

1377
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:04,960
so I thought
we'd pick her up

1378
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:08,160
on our way to celebrate
at your favorite restaurant.

1379
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:09,760

01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:18,120
You what?

1432
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:20,520
Harry Stapler.

1433
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:22,240
We got engaged.

1434
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:26,600
I tried to tell
your mother,

1435
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:28,200
but she, uh,
she wouldn't listen.

1436
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:33,960
I'm really,
really... happy... Sonny.

1437
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:37,600
And Harry and I both
want the same things...

1438
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:38,920
here...

1439
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,520
in Indianapolis.

1440
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:08,960
I love you.

1441
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:21,760
I'm happy you're happy.

1442
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:28,320
I want for you
to be happy, too.

1443
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:40,800
Happy.

1444
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:52,880
Thank you.

1445
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:13,280
Hey, Buddy?

1446
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:23,200
Could you do me a favor?

1447
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:26,000
Sure.

1448
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:15,880
One way...

1449
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:17,160

1450
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:21,800
