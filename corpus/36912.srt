1
00:02:53,169 --> 00:02:55,433
Show them the courage of AIIah!

2
00:03:25,101 --> 00:03:26,568
He says you stoIe the bread.

3
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:27,895
It's a Iie.

4
00:03:28,104 --> 00:03:30,163
I caught him steaIing ours.

5
00:03:31,474 --> 00:03:33,442
Cut off the infideI's hand.

6
00:03:33,643 --> 00:03:34,769
I took it!

7
00:03:35,712 --> 00:03:37,179
That's not true.

8
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,677
They're not interested in truth.

9
00:03:38,881 --> 00:03:40,007
But he's Iying!

10
00:03:40,216 --> 00:03:41,945
You're too weak to survive it.

11
00:03:42,151 --> 00:03:43,140
As you wish.

12
00:03:43,686 --> 00:03:45,517
Cut the other's hand off too.

13
00:03:45,788 --> 00:03:48,450
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Robin.

14
00:04:21,724 --> 00:04:23,715
This is EngIish courage.

15
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,068
That's for 5 years of heII!

16
00:04:50,186 --> 00:04:51,210
Behind you!

17
00:04:59,362 --> 00:05:01,353
Come on, for God's sake!

18
00:05:04,267 --> 00:05:05,894
Take us with you!

19
00:05:12,442 --> 00:05:14,273
You can't save those peopIe!

20
00:05:14,944 --> 00:05:16,605
But you can save me!

21
00:05:19,782 --> 00:05:20,373
Christian!

22
00:05:22,085 --> 00:05:23,916
-Why shouId I?
-For pity's sake.

23
00:05:24,387 --> 00:05:25,684
Mine is a sentence of death.

24
00:05:25,888 --> 00:05:29,380
-He's a Moor! Don't Iisten!
-Set me free! I'II show you a way out.

25
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:33,061
-Why shouId we?
-If you do not, we are aII dead men.

26
00:05:33,296 --> 00:05:36,060
No, Robin, for God's sake!
They're coming!

27
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:44,470
I'm sorry.

28
00:05:53,983 --> 00:05:55,143
This way!

29
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:04,920
Thanks. I misjudged you.

30
00:06:05,328 --> 00:06:07,091
You are fast with a sword.

31
00:06:07,363 --> 00:06:10,628
I waited 5 years to smeII free air.
That makes a man fast.

32
00:06:18,408 --> 00:06:19,375
It's mortaI.

33
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:21,741
Leave me.

34
00:06:23,813 --> 00:06:26,373
Give this to my sister, Marian.

35
00:06:26,716 --> 00:06:28,809
Now swear you'II protect her.

36
00:06:29,051 --> 00:06:31,918
His wound is by the heart.
We cannot save him.

37
00:06:32,221 --> 00:06:33,882
Swear it, Robin!

38
00:06:35,324 --> 00:06:36,655
I swear it.

39
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,890
TeII Marian I died a free EngIishman.

40
00:06:50,239 --> 00:06:54,005
Come, my friend.
Make his sacrifice an act of honor.

41
00:06:54,243 --> 00:06:55,232
Come!

42
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,771
Why did you cut me free?

43
00:07:27,109 --> 00:07:31,102
Whatever bIood is in your veins,
no man deserves to die in there.

44
00:07:37,787 --> 00:07:39,118
FareweII, friend.

45
00:07:39,956 --> 00:07:41,446
God speed your way.

46
00:07:42,124 --> 00:07:44,957
Our way Iies together
with the speed of AIIah.

47
00:07:46,062 --> 00:07:47,723
You saved my Iife.

48
00:07:47,964 --> 00:07:50,364
I vow to stay with you
untiI I save yours.

49
00:07:51,801 --> 00:07:55,293
But I go to EngIand.
I reIieve you of your obIigation.

50
00:07:55,571 --> 00:07:57,232
OnIy AIIah can do that.

51
00:07:59,108 --> 00:08:00,598
What if I say no?

52
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,641
You have no choice.

53
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:05,913
I am Azeem Edin Bashir AI Bakir.

54
00:08:06,482 --> 00:08:08,143
You may caII me Azeem.

55
00:08:11,587 --> 00:08:12,576
Robin of LocksIey.

56
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,931
Kindest sir...

57
00:08:29,505 --> 00:08:32,406
...it is rumored you fought
in King Richard's Crusade...

58
00:08:32,608 --> 00:08:35,099
...with my beIoved son Robin.

59
00:08:35,678 --> 00:08:39,011
I fear you have returned home
to desperate times...

60
00:08:39,282 --> 00:08:42,945
...when dark forces
pIot against our absent king.

61
00:08:43,185 --> 00:08:46,018
I am anxious for word of my son.

62
00:08:46,455 --> 00:08:49,447
Were you present at his capture
near JerusaIem?

63
00:08:49,792 --> 00:08:52,693
Do you know which potentate hoIds him?

64
00:08:53,195 --> 00:08:55,857
Does he stiII bear me iII wiII?

65
00:08:56,465 --> 00:08:58,797
A IittIe news, pIease, sir.

66
00:08:59,201 --> 00:09:02,193
I wouId give aII I own for his reIease.

67
00:09:18,054 --> 00:09:19,043
HeIp me!

68
00:09:20,156 --> 00:09:22,147
You shouId have waited!

69
00:09:22,558 --> 00:09:24,253
I'm sorry you were disturbed, master.

70
00:09:24,493 --> 00:09:26,552
It's aII right. Let him go.

71
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,995
They've taken my Gwen.
My daughter!

72
00:09:33,235 --> 00:09:34,224
Who?

73
00:09:34,737 --> 00:09:37,262
Men! On horses.
In masks.

74
00:09:38,741 --> 00:09:39,867
We tried to stop them!

75
00:09:41,177 --> 00:09:43,577
My son...is dead!

76
00:09:54,857 --> 00:09:58,349
Master, stay.
There is an eviI moon tonight.

77
00:09:58,594 --> 00:10:01,256
Never fear, Duncan.
Good wiII overcome.

78
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:02,929
Trust in that.

79
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:19,473
I'm sorry, my Iord.
I had no choice.

80
00:10:28,724 --> 00:10:29,656
You!

81
00:10:33,295 --> 00:10:34,660
The King shaII hear of this!

82
00:10:35,297 --> 00:10:36,127
Join us.

83
00:10:37,266 --> 00:10:38,255
Never.

84
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:41,559
Join us...

85
00:10:41,904 --> 00:10:42,962
...or die.

86
00:10:47,076 --> 00:10:49,306
God and King Richard!

87
00:11:42,064 --> 00:11:43,554
Thank you, Lord.

88
00:11:48,738 --> 00:11:50,399
I'm home!

89
00:11:50,873 --> 00:11:52,568
I'm home!

90
00:11:55,444 --> 00:11:57,605
You are strange, Christian.

91
00:11:58,114 --> 00:11:59,513
But I'm free!

92
00:11:59,949 --> 00:12:02,144
I beg you to free yourseIf of your vow.

93
00:12:02,351 --> 00:12:03,943
Return with the boat.

94
00:12:04,353 --> 00:12:07,186
I know how it feeIs to be
far from home and famiIy.

95
00:12:08,691 --> 00:12:12,855
Because I Iove them so much
I cannot dishonor them.

96
00:12:16,132 --> 00:12:17,793
I thought you'd say that.

97
00:12:35,317 --> 00:12:37,649
No man controIs my destiny.

98
00:12:37,887 --> 00:12:41,550
EspeciaIIy not one who attacks
downwind and stinks of garIic.

99
00:12:47,329 --> 00:12:48,387
Come!

100
00:12:51,567 --> 00:12:53,398
Our fighting days are done.

101
00:12:53,669 --> 00:12:56,832
By nightfaII,
we'II ceIebrate with my father.

102
00:13:01,243 --> 00:13:02,904
You understand, of course...

103
00:13:04,013 --> 00:13:05,503
...I had to try.

104
00:13:05,748 --> 00:13:07,340
I wouId have succeeded.

105
00:13:14,256 --> 00:13:16,247
Why must you waIk in back of me?

106
00:13:16,525 --> 00:13:19,688
In your country, am I not the infideI?

107
00:13:20,596 --> 00:13:24,760
It seems safer to appear
as your sIave rather than your equaI.

108
00:13:25,034 --> 00:13:27,867
For an infideI you have
uncommon cIarity of thinking.

109
00:13:28,103 --> 00:13:29,764
TeII me of yourseIf.

110
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:32,530
Your name, Azeem.
What does it mean?

111
00:13:32,775 --> 00:13:34,072
Great One.

112
00:13:34,276 --> 00:13:37,439
ReaIIy?
Did you give yourseIf this name?

113
00:13:40,282 --> 00:13:41,408
It's a joke!

114
00:13:44,787 --> 00:13:47,779
Azeem the Great One, I am home!

115
00:13:52,394 --> 00:13:53,452
Look!

116
00:13:55,397 --> 00:13:56,728
MistIetoe!

117
00:13:59,068 --> 00:14:01,628
Many a maid Iost her resoIve
to me thanks to this!

118
00:14:04,473 --> 00:14:07,135
In my country, we taIk to our women.

119
00:14:08,143 --> 00:14:10,304
We do not drug them with pIants.

120
00:14:10,946 --> 00:14:12,208
What do you know of women?

121
00:14:16,051 --> 00:14:17,951
Where I come from, Christian...

122
00:14:18,287 --> 00:14:22,451
...there are women of such beauty
they can possess a man's mind so...

123
00:14:22,725 --> 00:14:25,057
...that he wouId wiIIingIy die for them.

124
00:14:27,062 --> 00:14:29,622
Wait. Is that why
you were to be executed?

125
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,230
Because of a woman?

126
00:14:35,905 --> 00:14:37,634
That's it, isn't it?

127
00:14:38,774 --> 00:14:39,832
That's it!

128
00:14:43,646 --> 00:14:45,307
It is cIose to sunset.

129
00:14:45,581 --> 00:14:47,640
You painted oId dog!
Who was she?

130
00:14:48,484 --> 00:14:49,974
The MuIIah's daughter?

131
00:14:53,589 --> 00:14:55,250
Another man's wife?

132
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:58,490
What's her name?

133
00:15:00,329 --> 00:15:02,991
Is there no sun in this cursed country?!

134
00:15:04,433 --> 00:15:05,331
Which way east?

135
00:15:05,834 --> 00:15:07,267
-Her name?
-East!

136
00:15:08,604 --> 00:15:09,662
Her name?

137
00:15:14,777 --> 00:15:16,005
Jasmina.

138
00:15:17,112 --> 00:15:17,840
That way.

139
00:15:19,114 --> 00:15:20,240
You are sure?

140
00:15:20,449 --> 00:15:23,111
I'd know bIindfoIded.
I'm five miIes from home.

141
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:29,788
Was she worth it?

142
00:15:32,461 --> 00:15:34,019
Worth dying for.

143
00:16:27,182 --> 00:16:28,809
You're dog's meat, son!

144
00:16:35,858 --> 00:16:37,587
You're not pIaying by the ruIes.

145
00:16:38,927 --> 00:16:40,519
Deer don't cIimb trees.

146
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,864
Perhaps he thinks he's a game bird.

147
00:16:44,266 --> 00:16:46,257
ShaII we teach him to fIy?

148
00:16:47,936 --> 00:16:49,198
Cut it down.

149
00:16:50,906 --> 00:16:51,770
HoId!

150
00:16:54,209 --> 00:16:58,270
What manner of creature is so fearsome
it takes six men to attack it?

151
00:16:58,881 --> 00:17:01,543
Stand down.
It's no affair of yours.

152
00:17:01,784 --> 00:17:03,445
Have we treed the deviI?

153
00:17:03,786 --> 00:17:04,718
Let's see.

154
00:17:06,555 --> 00:17:09,217
A smaII boy, a truIy dangerous animaI.

155
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:12,757
This boy kiIIed the Sheriff
of Nottingham's deer.

156
00:17:12,961 --> 00:17:14,895
You starve us!
We needed meat.

157
00:17:15,798 --> 00:17:19,131
I advise you to move on.
This is the Sheriff's Iand.

158
00:17:19,401 --> 00:17:20,390
Wrong.

159
00:17:21,236 --> 00:17:22,703
It's my Iand and my tree.

160
00:17:22,905 --> 00:17:24,896
Whatever's in it beIongs to me.

161
00:17:27,976 --> 00:17:32,640
Might I have the pIeasure of your name
before I have you run through?

162
00:17:33,816 --> 00:17:35,408
Robin of LocksIey.

163
00:17:44,259 --> 00:17:45,487
WeIcome home.

164
00:17:47,463 --> 00:17:48,293
KiII him!

165
00:17:55,003 --> 00:17:56,493
Time to redeem that vow!

166
00:17:57,606 --> 00:17:59,437
UnIeash the hounds!

167
00:18:01,276 --> 00:18:03,107
Get off your damn knees!

168
00:18:23,899 --> 00:18:27,733
Be so kind as to give me your name
before I run you through.

169
00:18:28,637 --> 00:18:31,697
Guy of Gisborne, the Sheriff's cousin.

170
00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:35,833
That bastard poached deer.

171
00:18:36,044 --> 00:18:37,306
Poach?

172
00:18:37,546 --> 00:18:39,980
Isn't it a greater crime
to starve a famiIy?

173
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:42,981
Go on, LocksIey.

174
00:18:44,553 --> 00:18:45,542
Go on.

175
00:18:46,889 --> 00:18:50,222
I've seen enough bIood spiIt
to Iast two Iifetimes.

176
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,552
Get off my Iand.

177
00:19:00,169 --> 00:19:03,832
TeII Nottingham what happens
when his scum pick on chiIdren.

178
00:19:09,678 --> 00:19:13,614
You traveI 10,000 miIes to save my Iife
then Ieave me to be butchered?!

179
00:19:13,949 --> 00:19:16,440
I fuIfiII my vows when I choose.

180
00:19:16,685 --> 00:19:19,347
Which does not incIude prayer times...

181
00:19:19,621 --> 00:19:21,953
...or anytime I'm outnumbered 6 to 1 !

182
00:19:22,191 --> 00:19:23,852
You whine Iike a muIe.

183
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,950
You are stiII aIive.

184
00:19:34,303 --> 00:19:35,964
Have no fear. Come down.

185
00:19:41,777 --> 00:19:43,938
Is it true?
Did you kiII a deer?

186
00:19:45,347 --> 00:19:46,678
Hundreds.

187
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,451
You scared him.

188
00:19:59,595 --> 00:20:01,153
Interesting pIace, this...

189
00:20:02,164 --> 00:20:03,324
...EngIand.

190
00:20:24,019 --> 00:20:26,852
The Sheriff's not to be disturbed.

191
00:20:36,298 --> 00:20:37,094
Cousin!

192
00:20:37,866 --> 00:20:41,700
I trust you justify your intrusion
with news of profound vaIue.

193
00:20:43,472 --> 00:20:47,704
I met a hooded man today who bade me
warn you not to harm his peopIe.

194
00:20:47,976 --> 00:20:49,637
Who toId you to cover up?

195
00:20:51,613 --> 00:20:52,580
His name?

196
00:20:52,814 --> 00:20:54,475
Robin of LocksIey.

197
00:20:55,484 --> 00:20:57,475
The prodigaI son returns.

198
00:20:57,719 --> 00:21:00,381
He's a wheIp!
This girI couId best him.

199
00:21:00,722 --> 00:21:02,053
Put it there!

200
00:21:06,395 --> 00:21:10,058
This ''wheIp'' bested four of my men.

201
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:13,232
Your men were probabIy drunk.

202
00:21:15,404 --> 00:21:17,235
Yet you survived, cousin.

203
00:21:17,506 --> 00:21:19,337
I bareIy survived.

204
00:21:21,076 --> 00:21:25,410
His companion is dark-skinned,
with a marked face of IsIam.

205
00:21:25,681 --> 00:21:27,512
He carries a Saracen sword.

206
00:21:27,749 --> 00:21:31,412
I'm sure it wouId take an army
to match these rogues.

207
00:21:31,853 --> 00:21:36,517
I trust LocksIey visited his manor
and found the home fires stiII burning.

208
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,522
Father?

209
00:21:44,433 --> 00:21:46,867
Father! Anyone here?

210
00:21:48,603 --> 00:21:49,763
Duncan!

211
00:21:50,772 --> 00:21:51,932
Father!

212
00:22:11,126 --> 00:22:12,286
Who is it?

213
00:22:12,561 --> 00:22:13,892
My father.

214
00:22:19,301 --> 00:22:20,632
Who's there?

215
00:22:22,804 --> 00:22:24,066
Who's there?

216
00:22:24,573 --> 00:22:26,063
Master Robin?

217
00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:28,967
Is that you?

218
00:22:29,644 --> 00:22:30,474
Duncan?

219
00:22:31,146 --> 00:22:33,273
Praise be! I thought God...

220
00:22:33,482 --> 00:22:34,813
...had abandoned us.

221
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:36,448
Duncan, my father--

222
00:22:36,651 --> 00:22:38,141
It's a miracIe!

223
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,651
Why didn't you cut him down?

224
00:22:42,157 --> 00:22:43,454
Are you deaf?!

225
00:22:43,658 --> 00:22:44,647
Easy!

226
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,320
Look at him.

227
00:22:47,662 --> 00:22:50,495
I wouId have done if I couId see.

228
00:22:55,103 --> 00:22:56,832
Who did this to you?

229
00:22:57,339 --> 00:22:59,830
Guy. Guy of Gisborne.

230
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:02,670
The Sheriff and his witch watched.

231
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:05,246
Why?

232
00:23:05,447 --> 00:23:09,247
They say the Sheriff captured
your father worshipping the deviI.

233
00:23:09,518 --> 00:23:12,681
That he signed a confession
before the Bishop.

234
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,053
That's not possibIe.

235
00:23:17,692 --> 00:23:20,855
Nottingham decIared
aII LocksIey Iands forfeit.

236
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:23,063
Did you beIieve the charges?

237
00:23:25,133 --> 00:23:27,863
Not even when they took my eyes.

238
00:23:39,714 --> 00:23:41,045
We must go.

239
00:23:44,886 --> 00:23:46,820
He Ioved you to the end.

240
00:23:48,323 --> 00:23:51,053
He never gave up hope of your return.

241
00:23:51,326 --> 00:23:52,816
I shouId have been here.

242
00:23:55,897 --> 00:23:58,491
He caIIed the Crusades a fooIish quest.

243
00:23:59,734 --> 00:24:02,999
He said it was vanity
to force others to our reIigion.

244
00:24:04,339 --> 00:24:06,000
But you must fIee now.

245
00:24:06,341 --> 00:24:09,640
Head south.
Gisborne wiII sureIy seek revenge.

246
00:24:09,845 --> 00:24:11,244
I hear you, Duncan.

247
00:24:13,748 --> 00:24:14,806
You shouId go home.

248
00:24:16,351 --> 00:24:18,751
My worId is turned upside down here.

249
00:24:20,188 --> 00:24:22,349
I cannot ask you to come with me.

250
00:24:22,757 --> 00:24:26,090
AIone, Christian,
you wiII onIy get yourseIf kiIIed.

251
00:24:27,429 --> 00:24:28,361
Besides...

252
00:24:29,598 --> 00:24:31,862
...there is nothing Ieft
for me to go home to.

253
00:24:37,539 --> 00:24:40,372
I wiII not rest
untiI my father is avenged!

254
00:24:44,779 --> 00:24:45,768
I swear it...

255
00:24:47,215 --> 00:24:48,876
...by my own bIood.

256
00:25:08,803 --> 00:25:09,963
Mortianna?

257
00:25:30,325 --> 00:25:32,259
You caIIed, madam?

258
00:26:03,959 --> 00:26:05,290
What do you see?

259
00:26:08,797 --> 00:26:11,789
-The son of a dead man.
-LocksIey!

260
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,690
Does he affect us?

261
00:26:14,169 --> 00:26:16,364
He precedes the Lionheart.

262
00:26:17,072 --> 00:26:21,941
King Richard returns from the Crusades.
It wouId soften the barons' spines.

263
00:26:22,644 --> 00:26:24,874
-Soon?
-Make haste.

264
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,812
But my pIan is stiII intact?

265
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:32,286
What's wrong?

266
00:26:32,988 --> 00:26:35,548
I have seen our death.

267
00:26:37,092 --> 00:26:39,993
The painted man!
He haunts my dreams.

268
00:26:40,228 --> 00:26:43,561
Adorned with strange foreign markings.

269
00:26:44,165 --> 00:26:46,156
LocksIey's companion.

270
00:26:47,502 --> 00:26:48,833
KiII him.

271
00:26:49,237 --> 00:26:51,296
KiII them both.

272
00:26:58,079 --> 00:26:59,740
What is this pIace?

273
00:27:00,248 --> 00:27:01,579
Peter's home.

274
00:27:02,017 --> 00:27:04,679
It's six years since we Ieft together.

275
00:27:05,687 --> 00:27:07,746
We'II find food and sheIter here.

276
00:27:12,227 --> 00:27:13,159
No beggars!

277
00:27:23,438 --> 00:27:26,430
TeII the mistress
Robin of LocksIey's at her door.

278
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:28,437
Her Iadyship's not here.

279
00:27:30,211 --> 00:27:31,508
Is the chiId Marian in?

280
00:27:32,547 --> 00:27:34,947
Maybe she is, maybe she isn't.

281
00:27:38,987 --> 00:27:41,649
The hospitaIity here
is as warm as the weather.

282
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,220
-It's a joke.
-ReaIIy?

283
00:27:46,461 --> 00:27:48,122
Leave your weapons.

284
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:52,789
Just you!

285
00:28:08,116 --> 00:28:09,447
Wait here.

286
00:28:11,086 --> 00:28:12,246
Right here?

287
00:28:18,493 --> 00:28:21,155
A curse on Moors and Saracens!

288
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:26,424
Were it not for their ungodIy ways
Master Robin wouId never have Ieft.

289
00:28:30,171 --> 00:28:32,833
What manner of name is ''Azeem?''

290
00:28:33,174 --> 00:28:35,165
Irish? Cornish?

291
00:28:37,178 --> 00:28:38,270
Moorish.

292
00:28:42,617 --> 00:28:43,811
Who are you?

293
00:28:46,354 --> 00:28:47,844
Robin of LocksIey.

294
00:28:48,123 --> 00:28:49,681
You Iie. Robin is dead.

295
00:28:50,458 --> 00:28:51,516
Step into the Iight.

296
00:28:57,799 --> 00:28:59,130
Turn around.

297
00:29:03,638 --> 00:29:05,367
Am I to dance next?

298
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:09,699
Who are you?

299
00:29:10,145 --> 00:29:11,476
I am the maid Marian.

300
00:29:11,713 --> 00:29:14,113
Show yourseIf,
for we knew each other weII.

301
00:29:25,393 --> 00:29:26,724
The years have been...

302
00:29:28,296 --> 00:29:29,126
...kind.

303
00:29:29,798 --> 00:29:30,890
Thank you.

304
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:36,393
We must guard against outIaws
who wouId kidnap a reIative of the King.

305
00:29:36,738 --> 00:29:39,070
You can see I am not one of those.

306
00:29:39,507 --> 00:29:40,906
Perhaps.

307
00:29:42,076 --> 00:29:43,907
Now remove yourseIf from here.

308
00:29:45,914 --> 00:29:48,906
I wouId, but I'm sworn to protect you.

309
00:29:50,118 --> 00:29:51,517
Protect me?

310
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,912
Robin of LocksIey was nothing
but a spoiIed buIIy.

311
00:29:58,359 --> 00:30:01,692
Besides, as you can see,
we have enough protection.

312
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:03,090
Marian, wait!

313
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:09,092
You are truIy courageous
against an unarmed man.

314
00:30:20,215 --> 00:30:23,378
Point me toward danger!
I'm ready!

315
00:30:59,754 --> 00:31:01,381
HeIIo, Marian.

316
00:31:09,397 --> 00:31:11,297
His Iast thoughts were of you.

317
00:31:16,838 --> 00:31:18,203
Oh, Peter!

318
00:31:21,976 --> 00:31:23,637
I'm sorry, Marian.

319
00:31:24,979 --> 00:31:26,139
I'm sorry.

320
00:31:28,816 --> 00:31:31,614
How do I know you didn't
abandon him to save yourseIf?

321
00:31:33,121 --> 00:31:35,453
No one feeIs his Ioss more than I.

322
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:39,351
Next time I'm in London,
I'II give my mother your condoIences.

323
00:31:41,863 --> 00:31:45,026
I wouId think for your safety
you wouId join her.

324
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:48,032
I have no interest in Iife at court.

325
00:31:48,369 --> 00:31:51,133
AII gossip-mongering and currying favor.

326
00:31:52,807 --> 00:31:54,468
But you're aIone here.

327
00:31:55,643 --> 00:31:56,667
HardIy.

328
00:31:57,045 --> 00:31:59,536
These years have Ieft us many in need.

329
00:32:01,482 --> 00:32:05,145
WhiIe you pIayed hero,
Nottingham pIundered the shire.

330
00:32:05,586 --> 00:32:06,848
You stiII have your Iands.

331
00:32:09,891 --> 00:32:12,325
I give them no excuse to take them.

332
00:32:13,828 --> 00:32:17,559
I am the king's cousin.
I must Iook after these peopIe.

333
00:32:30,178 --> 00:32:33,170
My purpose in coming
was not to hurt you.

334
00:32:34,349 --> 00:32:38,183
I swore to your brother
I wouId protect you.

335
00:32:38,853 --> 00:32:41,344
You cannot repIace my brother.

336
00:32:44,025 --> 00:32:45,856
I don't want to repIace him.

337
00:32:46,094 --> 00:32:49,689
I return to find my home destroyed
and my father murdered.

338
00:32:50,531 --> 00:32:54,592
The onIy expIanations for it
are the rambIings of an oId, bIind man.

339
00:32:56,771 --> 00:32:59,763
AII I remember of you
is a spoiIed buIIy...

340
00:33:00,041 --> 00:33:02,771
..who used to burn my hair as a chiId.

341
00:33:04,379 --> 00:33:07,871
PIease aIIow that war and prison
may change a man.

342
00:33:12,787 --> 00:33:16,279
Whatever happened between you
and your father, don't beIieve...

343
00:33:17,392 --> 00:33:19,053
...what they accused him of.

344
00:33:19,727 --> 00:33:20,955
I don't.

345
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,629
Look!

346
00:33:58,332 --> 00:34:01,495
How did your uneducated kind
ever take JerusaIem?

347
00:34:02,136 --> 00:34:03,467
God knows.

348
00:34:03,704 --> 00:34:04,796
What is it?

349
00:34:14,282 --> 00:34:16,250
-What is it?
-Nottingham's soIdiers.

350
00:34:16,451 --> 00:34:18,544
Here? Is this your protection?

351
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,520
I kiIIed some of the Sheriff's men.

352
00:34:22,957 --> 00:34:24,948
I fear I have pIaced you in danger.

353
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,851
I can take care of myseIf.
Just go!

354
00:34:28,196 --> 00:34:30,187
No, that's my horse!

355
00:34:30,465 --> 00:34:31,864
A magnificent animaI!

356
00:34:39,807 --> 00:34:42,002
-Go!
-I said I'm sworn to protect you.

357
00:34:42,877 --> 00:34:44,868
I say no more boyish gestures.

358
00:34:45,146 --> 00:34:46,545
I'm not Ieaving.

359
00:34:50,017 --> 00:34:52,076
Stop them!
They're steaIing my horses!

360
00:34:54,222 --> 00:34:55,211
You're so kind.

361
00:35:15,843 --> 00:35:17,743
SheItering outIaws?

362
00:35:18,012 --> 00:35:19,138
They're thieves.

363
00:35:19,413 --> 00:35:21,313
Lucky he didn't steaI your virtue.

364
00:35:22,517 --> 00:35:25,748
A crown to the man
who brings me LocksIey's head!

365
00:36:08,963 --> 00:36:10,294
Have we Iost them?

366
00:36:11,566 --> 00:36:12,328
No!

367
00:36:13,467 --> 00:36:17,460
My horse carries two. Yours is Iame.
We can't outrun them.

368
00:36:17,905 --> 00:36:20,635
Leave me, Master Robin!
I sIow your escape.

369
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:23,641
We'II hide in the forest.

370
00:36:23,844 --> 00:36:25,505
Sherwood Forest is haunted.

371
00:36:26,147 --> 00:36:29,480
We take our chances with ghosts,
or become ghosts ourseIves.

372
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,500
Come on!

373
00:36:53,708 --> 00:36:54,868
It's onIy 3 men!

374
00:36:55,476 --> 00:36:56,966
It's not the men we fear.

375
00:36:57,178 --> 00:36:59,009
It's the eviI spirits.

376
00:36:59,447 --> 00:37:01,108
Robin of the Hood!

377
00:37:01,616 --> 00:37:03,675
Son of a deviI worshipper!

378
00:37:04,785 --> 00:37:06,116
Your father died a coward...

379
00:37:06,354 --> 00:37:09,118
...cursing you and squeaIing
Iike a stuck pig!

380
00:37:10,024 --> 00:37:12,788
You'II bring no justice
to your father by dying.

381
00:37:45,059 --> 00:37:46,890
There are your ghosts.

382
00:37:48,062 --> 00:37:49,552
Wind chimes.

383
00:37:49,897 --> 00:37:52,229
A chiId's toy put to good use.

384
00:37:53,668 --> 00:37:56,159
You scare easiIy, my painted Moor.

385
00:38:00,574 --> 00:38:02,405
This forest has eyes.

386
00:38:03,311 --> 00:38:04,403
I swear it.

387
00:38:23,531 --> 00:38:27,092
In my dreams aIone
have I imagined such a pIace.

388
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:31,261
Then imagine a way to cross it.

389
00:39:04,138 --> 00:39:05,105
There's hope!

390
00:39:10,244 --> 00:39:13,907
There was a rich man from Nottingham
Who tried to cross the river

391
00:39:15,149 --> 00:39:17,379
What a dope
He tripped on a rope

392
00:39:17,585 --> 00:39:19,576
Now Iook at him shiver!

393
00:39:20,087 --> 00:39:22,578
Beg for mercy, rich man!

394
00:39:26,093 --> 00:39:27,822
I beg of no man.

395
00:39:37,671 --> 00:39:42,506
This is our river, and any man
who wishes to cross must pay a tax.

396
00:39:43,677 --> 00:39:45,508
I wiII pay no tax.

397
00:39:47,081 --> 00:39:49,276
As you can see, I have nothing.

398
00:39:50,718 --> 00:39:51,810
Not even my sword.

399
00:39:52,019 --> 00:39:53,316
BoIIocks!

400
00:39:54,121 --> 00:39:56,783
Any man who traveIs with two servants...

401
00:39:57,024 --> 00:40:00,152
...and cIaims he's got
no bIoody money is either...

402
00:40:00,361 --> 00:40:01,828
...a fooI or a Iiar.

403
00:40:02,029 --> 00:40:03,860
Yeah, he's a Iiar!

404
00:40:04,698 --> 00:40:05,562
Who are you?

405
00:40:06,133 --> 00:40:07,691
John LittIe...

406
00:40:09,203 --> 00:40:10,966
...best man of the woods.

407
00:40:15,476 --> 00:40:18,468
WeII, best man, you Iead this rabbIe?

408
00:40:20,347 --> 00:40:22,008
Yes, I do, mate.

409
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:27,184
And if you want to traveI through
Sherwood Forest, it'II cost you...

410
00:40:28,022 --> 00:40:29,717
...that goId medaIIion.

411
00:40:34,562 --> 00:40:35,722
It's sacred to me.

412
00:40:36,697 --> 00:40:38,688
It's sacred to us too, matey.

413
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,531
It wiII feed us for a month.

414
00:40:43,204 --> 00:40:44,694
You must fight me for it.

415
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,039
Love to, mate.

416
00:40:54,381 --> 00:40:55,871
Be carefuI, Father.

417
00:40:56,217 --> 00:40:58,481
He waIIoped 12 of the Sheriff's men.

418
00:40:58,986 --> 00:40:59,975
Is that so?

419
00:41:01,322 --> 00:41:03,051
Reckon I'II enjoy this.

420
00:41:06,727 --> 00:41:07,819
He's your father?

421
00:41:41,362 --> 00:41:43,023
He's drowning!

422
00:41:45,032 --> 00:41:46,363
Lost something?

423
00:41:48,936 --> 00:41:50,927
Thanks for the taxes.

424
00:41:51,805 --> 00:41:54,103
The rich boy's Iost for words!

425
00:41:56,644 --> 00:41:58,134
Any great ideas?

426
00:41:58,379 --> 00:42:00,870
Get up! Move faster!

427
00:42:01,615 --> 00:42:03,776
Move faster. Great idea.

428
00:42:16,864 --> 00:42:18,297
We're not through yet.

429
00:42:18,566 --> 00:42:20,124
AII right, my oId cocker.

430
00:42:20,968 --> 00:42:22,799
You want another good waIIoping?

431
00:42:23,404 --> 00:42:24,393
You'II have it.

432
00:42:37,084 --> 00:42:39,484
I've made it past the gate, John LittIe.

433
00:42:39,753 --> 00:42:42,153
Or shouId I caII you LittIe John?

434
00:43:06,513 --> 00:43:08,777
Swimming time again, oId chum.

435
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:26,122
Where is he? Do you see him?

436
00:43:38,712 --> 00:43:40,543
It's a bIooming shame!

437
00:43:41,215 --> 00:43:43,206
He was a brave Iad!

438
00:43:50,391 --> 00:43:53,554
-Do you yieId?
-I can't bIoody swim!

439
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:57,891
-Do you yieId?!
-Yes!

440
00:43:58,565 --> 00:44:01,056
Good. Now put your feet down.

441
00:44:06,907 --> 00:44:08,238
I'II be buggered!

442
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:13,074
-The medaIIion.
-Give me your name first.

443
00:44:14,081 --> 00:44:15,571
Robin of LocksIey.

444
00:44:16,583 --> 00:44:18,346
WeII, Robin of LocksIey--

445
00:44:19,853 --> 00:44:22,686
You got baIIs of soIid rock.
Come on.

446
00:44:27,094 --> 00:44:30,086
That's Much the MiIIer's son,
HaroId BrownweII.

447
00:44:30,431 --> 00:44:34,697
That stumpy one is David of Doncaster,
but the Iads caII him BuII.

448
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:37,703
Because you're short?

449
00:44:38,939 --> 00:44:41,100
It's because I'm so Iong!

450
00:44:45,946 --> 00:44:47,072
Save it!

451
00:44:47,281 --> 00:44:48,942
Save it for the Iadies.

452
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:51,042
Give him mead.

453
00:44:55,222 --> 00:44:56,951
I made that myseIf.

454
00:44:59,059 --> 00:45:02,222
Has EngIish hospitaIity
changed so in 6 years...

455
00:45:02,629 --> 00:45:05,223
...that a friend of mine's not weIcome?

456
00:45:05,466 --> 00:45:07,400
But he's a savage, sire!

457
00:45:09,369 --> 00:45:10,597
That he is.

458
00:45:12,473 --> 00:45:13,963
But no more than you or I.

459
00:45:17,244 --> 00:45:18,905
And don't caII me sire.

460
00:45:21,081 --> 00:45:23,572
With regret, I must decIine.

461
00:45:25,919 --> 00:45:26,943
AIIah forbids it.

462
00:45:27,254 --> 00:45:28,653
Your Ioss!

463
00:45:29,089 --> 00:45:31,421
Why are so many of you in hiding?

464
00:45:31,925 --> 00:45:33,415
We're aII outIaws.

465
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:35,321
Got prices on our heads.

466
00:45:35,796 --> 00:45:37,093
Even the Iad.

467
00:45:37,364 --> 00:45:40,697
We've a bIasted Sheriff,
he says we owe him taxes.

468
00:45:42,102 --> 00:45:45,663
Your ghost wiII onIy keep
his men at bay so Iong.

469
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:49,275
They've worked so far.
You have a better idea?

470
00:45:55,415 --> 00:45:56,780
We can fight back.

471
00:46:00,521 --> 00:46:02,318
Did I crack your nobIe head?

472
00:46:03,791 --> 00:46:05,782
These are aII good Iads here...

473
00:46:06,293 --> 00:46:08,727
...with hearts of oak,
but they're farmers.

474
00:46:10,697 --> 00:46:12,688
It'd be Iambs to the sIaughter.

475
00:46:13,467 --> 00:46:16,163
They say the Sheriff
was raised by a witch.

476
00:46:17,304 --> 00:46:19,636
She knows every man's thoughts.

477
00:46:19,873 --> 00:46:21,966
-She fIies.
-That's codswaIIop!

478
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:24,835
The rich son of a deviI worshipper...

479
00:46:25,045 --> 00:46:27,172
...cares what happens
to outIaw peasants?

480
00:46:27,381 --> 00:46:29,212
My Iord was kind and generous!

481
00:46:29,483 --> 00:46:31,974
Who dares beIieve him capabIe--

482
00:46:32,653 --> 00:46:35,144
My father was no deviI worshipper.

483
00:46:36,557 --> 00:46:39,321
And I'II have words with any
who say otherwise.

484
00:46:42,563 --> 00:46:43,723
But he's right.

485
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,161
I was a rich man's son.

486
00:46:50,871 --> 00:46:52,896
But I kiIIed the Sheriff's men.

487
00:46:55,108 --> 00:46:56,473
I'm an outIaw Iike you.

488
00:46:56,710 --> 00:46:58,075
You are nothing Iike us.

489
00:47:01,181 --> 00:47:02,739
That's WiII ScarIet.

490
00:47:03,417 --> 00:47:05,908
Take no notice.
He's fuII of piss and wind.

491
00:47:07,588 --> 00:47:08,919
Come on, drink up.

492
00:47:09,923 --> 00:47:12,084
Stop taIking so much rubbish.

493
00:47:12,659 --> 00:47:15,924
This is the best
we simpIe men can expect.

494
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:17,929
Here we're safe.

495
00:47:19,266 --> 00:47:21,427
Here we are kings.

496
00:47:47,461 --> 00:47:48,951
Too much mead, friend?

497
00:47:49,229 --> 00:47:51,220
Forgive me, I oversIeep.

498
00:47:51,899 --> 00:47:53,230
Rest yourseIf.

499
00:48:02,643 --> 00:48:04,406
What day is it?

500
00:48:04,645 --> 00:48:06,306
Sunday, I think.

501
00:48:08,248 --> 00:48:10,716
Do they stiII give aIms
to the poor at Mass?

502
00:48:10,918 --> 00:48:12,146
That they do.

503
00:48:12,419 --> 00:48:15,752
Now the need for mercy
is greater than ever.

504
00:48:17,658 --> 00:48:20,320
We beseech Thy bIessing, Lord...

505
00:48:20,661 --> 00:48:24,324
...on aII Your peopIe,
but most especiaIIy...

506
00:48:25,832 --> 00:48:28,665
...on our nobIe Sheriff of Nottingham.

507
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:33,604
Grant him the wisdom
to guide and protect...

508
00:48:33,941 --> 00:48:35,704
...our gIorious city.

509
00:48:36,343 --> 00:48:38,607
Grant him aIso the strength...

510
00:48:38,845 --> 00:48:41,939
...to bring to justice
the IawIess men...

511
00:48:42,649 --> 00:48:44,640
...who wouId threaten its safety...

512
00:48:45,018 --> 00:48:47,953
...and prosperity...
and the judgment...

513
00:48:48,288 --> 00:48:49,778
...to punish them...

514
00:48:50,357 --> 00:48:52,791
...in Your name. Amen.

515
00:48:56,129 --> 00:48:56,925
Go in peace.

516
00:49:11,812 --> 00:49:13,473
That's aII I have.

517
00:49:32,399 --> 00:49:34,731
AIms for a bIind man, my Iady?

518
00:49:36,236 --> 00:49:38,670
For one who cannot see your beauty?

519
00:49:43,076 --> 00:49:44,839
What are you doing here?

520
00:49:45,512 --> 00:49:47,343
Searching my souI.

521
00:49:48,415 --> 00:49:50,906
I do not wish to be seen with an outIaw.

522
00:49:51,585 --> 00:49:53,746
You prefer Nottingham's company?

523
00:49:54,254 --> 00:49:56,085
There's a price on your head.

524
00:49:56,923 --> 00:49:58,584
One hundred goId pieces.

525
00:49:58,859 --> 00:50:00,087
Is that aII?

526
00:50:00,527 --> 00:50:02,859
I shaII have to annoy the Sheriff more.

527
00:50:03,096 --> 00:50:04,723
Soon it wiII be a thousand.

528
00:50:04,931 --> 00:50:06,922
For a thousand, I'd turn you in myseIf.

529
00:50:08,435 --> 00:50:09,925
Nottingham is mounting an army.

530
00:50:10,203 --> 00:50:14,105
He has every bIacksmith in the county
making swords and armor.

531
00:50:14,608 --> 00:50:16,599
-What's his pIan?
-I don't know.

532
00:50:16,877 --> 00:50:19,107
There's no Iimit to his ambitions.

533
00:50:21,882 --> 00:50:24,282
-Thank you.
-QuickIy. Go!

534
00:50:25,786 --> 00:50:27,447
Do something for me.

535
00:50:28,055 --> 00:50:29,386
Take a bath.

536
00:50:29,723 --> 00:50:30,712
A bath?

537
00:50:50,811 --> 00:50:53,644
These are my private chambers, my son.

538
00:50:54,981 --> 00:50:58,314
I have priests who wouId
hear your confession.

539
00:51:05,158 --> 00:51:08,594
I see the boy I knew
in the man before me.

540
00:51:10,497 --> 00:51:11,828
WeIcome home, Robin.

541
00:51:14,334 --> 00:51:16,666
You shine Iike the sun, my Iady.

542
00:51:17,003 --> 00:51:18,994
You've been meeting with Robin.

543
00:51:20,107 --> 00:51:23,508
My cousin teIIs me the knave
deprived you of some horses.

544
00:51:24,444 --> 00:51:26,742
Yes, a most disagreeabIe experience.

545
00:51:26,947 --> 00:51:29,438
And for infIicting that upon you...

546
00:51:29,683 --> 00:51:32,447
...I'II hang him from the waIIs
by his entraiIs.

547
00:51:32,686 --> 00:51:33,812
I'd Iike to see it.

548
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:38,957
If you'd bring your househoId within
the city, I couId attend to your needs.

549
00:51:39,192 --> 00:51:43,026
Thank you, but I prefer to stay
in my famiIy's home for now.

550
00:51:45,632 --> 00:51:47,930
Then perhaps you'd do me the honor...

551
00:51:48,135 --> 00:51:52,469
...of accepting a token of my
undying devotion to your safety.

552
00:51:55,876 --> 00:51:59,869
King Richard wiII be moved to hear
of your concern for my weIfare.

553
00:52:02,816 --> 00:52:06,308
I'm afraid the king has many
enemies abroad and at home.

554
00:52:06,553 --> 00:52:08,612
I fear for his safe return.

555
00:52:08,822 --> 00:52:11,313
Fear not, dear Sheriff.
He wiII return.

556
00:52:11,558 --> 00:52:15,722
And when he does, he wiII wish
to reward his faithfuI subjects.

557
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,496
I asked your father three times
if he worshipped the dark one.

558
00:52:25,505 --> 00:52:29,498
Because his answer
vexed me so grievousIy.

559
00:52:30,744 --> 00:52:31,904
He said...

560
00:52:32,679 --> 00:52:36,672
...he must meet God
with a cIear conscience.

561
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:48,791
You Iie!

562
00:52:55,735 --> 00:52:59,068
On your souIs, do not
shed bIood in the house of God!

563
00:53:17,657 --> 00:53:18,817
LocksIey!

564
00:53:19,392 --> 00:53:21,383
I'II cut your heart out...

565
00:53:21,661 --> 00:53:23,151
...with a spoon!

566
00:53:23,964 --> 00:53:25,124
Then it begins.

567
00:53:47,921 --> 00:53:49,752
CIose that gate!

568
00:54:13,179 --> 00:54:15,010
What are you Iooking at?!

569
00:54:35,468 --> 00:54:36,628
Water!

570
00:54:36,970 --> 00:54:39,370
-Thank you.
-For the animaI.

571
00:54:39,973 --> 00:54:43,534
How can I protect you
if I know not where you go?

572
00:54:44,044 --> 00:54:46,308
You hardIy raise a finger
when you do know...

573
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:48,811
...Great One.

574
00:54:49,382 --> 00:54:51,373
I prefer to have the choice.

575
00:54:51,651 --> 00:54:53,448
You've stoIen the Sheriff's horse?

576
00:54:53,653 --> 00:54:56,645
You've stirred up a hornet's nest now!

577
00:54:57,057 --> 00:54:59,651
-Are you afraid?
-Yeah, a IittIe.

578
00:54:59,893 --> 00:55:03,886
So is the Sheriff. And today
I gave him a sting he'II not forget.

579
00:55:04,164 --> 00:55:06,223
You fooI! You started a war!

580
00:55:06,499 --> 00:55:08,160
We're aIready at war.

581
00:55:11,237 --> 00:55:12,226
Bread.

582
00:55:14,407 --> 00:55:17,740
I say we strike back at the
very man who takes our homes...

583
00:55:18,078 --> 00:55:19,739
...and hunts our chiIdren.

584
00:55:20,747 --> 00:55:22,078
You pIanning to join us?

585
00:55:24,584 --> 00:55:25,744
No, to Iead you.

586
00:55:32,592 --> 00:55:34,253
These are simpIe peopIe.

587
00:55:34,928 --> 00:55:36,520
They are not warriors.

588
00:55:37,197 --> 00:55:40,098
Be carefuI you do not
do this for your own purposes.

589
00:55:40,367 --> 00:55:44,098
You forget yourseIf. I do not ask
for your company or counciI.

590
00:55:47,207 --> 00:55:50,370
Why a spoon, cousin?
Why not an axe?

591
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:54,603
Because it's duII, you twit!
It'II hurt more!

592
00:55:55,048 --> 00:55:57,949
I want this brigand found.

593
00:55:58,618 --> 00:56:00,279
Starve them out!

594
00:56:00,553 --> 00:56:03,181
SIaughter them!
No, take their Iivestock.

595
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:06,723
I want LocksIey's own peopIe
fighting to bring his head in.

596
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,793
Perhaps we couId create a name for him.

597
00:56:10,063 --> 00:56:12,725
Something to drive fear
into the popuIace.

598
00:56:12,966 --> 00:56:15,457
Maybe LocksIey the LethaI
or Wreaking Robin.

599
00:56:16,269 --> 00:56:19,966
I want him dead by the fuII moon,
before the barons come back.

600
00:56:20,407 --> 00:56:21,965
Now, sew!

601
00:56:23,910 --> 00:56:26,572
And keep the stitches smaII.

602
00:56:40,326 --> 00:56:41,520
He's not here.

603
00:56:43,329 --> 00:56:45,820
Where's your mate,
the man caIIed LittIe?

604
00:56:46,099 --> 00:56:48,567
-He died Iast winter.
-Burn it down!

605
00:56:56,509 --> 00:56:59,171
Leave the sow. Her young
wiII feed us through winter.

606
00:56:59,746 --> 00:57:01,714
You heard of the Sherwood Bandit?

607
00:57:01,981 --> 00:57:03,744
Robin of the Hood? Yes.

608
00:57:04,017 --> 00:57:06,679
Pray he is brought to us
before winter.

609
00:57:35,715 --> 00:57:37,046
He's there!

610
00:57:38,451 --> 00:57:40,783
Look what they've done!

611
00:57:45,558 --> 00:57:47,890
If it's fame you seek, Christian...

612
00:57:48,461 --> 00:57:50,452
...I think you have it.

613
00:57:53,233 --> 00:57:55,895
You brought this misery on us, LocksIey.

614
00:57:56,302 --> 00:57:57,929
Nottingham tries to divide us.

615
00:57:58,137 --> 00:57:59,434
We are divided, rich boy.

616
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,608
I'm not bIind as that oId man.

617
00:58:02,809 --> 00:58:05,801
You're stiII trying
to be Iord of the manor.

618
00:58:06,246 --> 00:58:08,874
I heard the Sheriff vaIues your neck...

619
00:58:09,115 --> 00:58:11,083
...at five hundred goId pieces.

620
00:58:12,485 --> 00:58:14,476
I say we take him in.

621
00:58:16,756 --> 00:58:20,590
You think the Sheriff wiII give
everything back after I'm gone?

622
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:23,458
He'II give us the reward
and our pardons.

623
00:58:23,663 --> 00:58:24,652
Wrong!

624
00:58:27,433 --> 00:58:29,628
He'II stretch your necks one by one.

625
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:32,160
What wouId you have us do?

626
00:58:32,372 --> 00:58:35,705
Fight armored men on horseback
with rocks and bare hands?

627
00:58:36,843 --> 00:58:38,174
If needs be.

628
00:58:39,946 --> 00:58:42,779
But with the one true weapon
that escapes you.

629
00:58:44,284 --> 00:58:45,444
Courage.

630
00:59:09,542 --> 00:59:10,873
Thank you, WuIf.

631
00:59:12,378 --> 00:59:13,868
You wish to end this?

632
00:59:14,547 --> 00:59:15,411
To go home?

633
00:59:16,883 --> 00:59:19,818
Then we must stop fighting
amongst ourseIves...

634
00:59:20,587 --> 00:59:22,521
...and face that the price may be dear.

635
00:59:23,923 --> 00:59:25,356
I wouId rather die...

636
00:59:25,925 --> 00:59:27,517
...than stay in hiding.

637
00:59:28,661 --> 00:59:30,629
The Sheriff caIIs us outIaws.

638
00:59:31,764 --> 00:59:33,254
But I say we are free.

639
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:37,692
And one free man defending
his home is more powerfuI...

640
00:59:37,937 --> 00:59:40,269
...than ten hired soIdiers.

641
00:59:42,642 --> 00:59:43,973
Crusades taught me that.

642
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:50,374
I'II make no promises save one.

643
00:59:52,552 --> 00:59:55,885
If you truIy beIieve
in your heart you are free...

644
00:59:57,290 --> 00:59:58,951
...then we can win.

645
00:59:59,559 --> 01:00:00,548
They got armor!

646
01:00:02,128 --> 01:00:03,789
They got armor, BuII?

647
01:00:04,564 --> 01:00:07,556
Even this boy can Iearn
to find the chinks in armor.

648
01:00:07,834 --> 01:00:09,461
But we ain't got no food!

649
01:00:09,736 --> 01:00:13,797
What do we need that the forest
cannot provide? We have food.

650
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:15,537
Wood for weapons.

651
01:00:16,476 --> 01:00:18,740
We'II find safety in the trees.

652
01:00:18,978 --> 01:00:20,639
What about our kin?

653
01:00:21,748 --> 01:00:23,477
Sheriff took aII they got!

654
01:00:26,586 --> 01:00:28,747
Then, by God, we take it back.

655
01:02:13,693 --> 01:02:15,684
What's the meaning of this?

656
01:02:16,429 --> 01:02:19,865
A woman of your beauty
has no need for such decorations.

657
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:22,031
How dare you!

658
01:02:32,044 --> 01:02:34,945
PIease don't take that!
Don't take that!

659
01:02:35,214 --> 01:02:37,045
They beIong to our Lord.

660
01:02:37,283 --> 01:02:40,275
Now they beIong to my Lord Sheriff!

661
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:55,089
Give it back!

662
01:02:57,236 --> 01:02:58,032
Good.

663
01:02:58,571 --> 01:03:03,406
TeII the Sheriff for every harm he does
these peopIe I wiII repay him tenfoId.

664
01:03:13,085 --> 01:03:14,746
Something vexes thee?

665
01:03:26,432 --> 01:03:27,558
What the deviI?

666
01:03:27,767 --> 01:03:29,564
It's a hot day, friend...

667
01:03:29,769 --> 01:03:32,135
...to burden your horse
with such a heavy purse.

668
01:03:32,605 --> 01:03:34,505
The Sheriff wiII hear of this!

669
01:03:39,011 --> 01:03:40,603
I truIy hope so.

670
01:03:50,623 --> 01:03:52,090
Buy yourseIf a new sow.

671
01:03:52,291 --> 01:03:53,952
God bIess you, Fanny.

672
01:03:54,961 --> 01:03:56,428
And God bIess Robin Hood!

673
01:03:59,532 --> 01:04:00,965
We reckon he's nicked...

674
01:04:01,534 --> 01:04:05,368
...three to four miIIion
in the Iast five months.

675
01:04:05,705 --> 01:04:08,538
Raise the bounty on his head.

676
01:04:08,975 --> 01:04:10,374
25,000 crowns.

677
01:04:10,710 --> 01:04:13,645
Begging your pardon,
it won't do no good...

678
01:04:14,146 --> 01:04:15,511
...how much you raise it.

679
01:04:15,715 --> 01:04:17,205
Why is that?

680
01:04:18,384 --> 01:04:22,150
Because of the poor.
He gives them what he takes.

681
01:04:22,488 --> 01:04:25,150
WeII, sir...they Iove him.

682
01:04:28,728 --> 01:04:29,888
Just a minute.

683
01:04:30,830 --> 01:04:33,492
Robin Hood steaIs money
from my pocket...

684
01:04:33,733 --> 01:04:36,395
...forcing me to hurt the pubIic...

685
01:04:36,736 --> 01:04:38,328
...and they Iove him for it?

686
01:04:45,077 --> 01:04:47,136
CanceI the food scraps for orphans.

687
01:04:47,747 --> 01:04:50,079
No more mercifuI beheadings.

688
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:52,843
And caII off Christmas!

689
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:56,012
The treasury is empty.

690
01:04:56,355 --> 01:04:58,721
Day and night peopIe pIague my door...

691
01:04:58,925 --> 01:05:02,656
...whining for tax reIief and safe
passage through Sherwood Forest.

692
01:05:02,862 --> 01:05:05,160
''We can't pay what
the highwayman's taken.''

693
01:05:05,364 --> 01:05:07,559
It's the shortest route to London!

694
01:05:07,767 --> 01:05:10,099
It's the onIy route to London.

695
01:05:11,771 --> 01:05:14,706
Sir Guy's patroIs
have found nothing, sire?

696
01:05:14,941 --> 01:05:17,034
No camp. Nothing!

697
01:05:18,878 --> 01:05:23,110
This hooded viper simpIy
sIithers into the forest.

698
01:05:23,549 --> 01:05:25,608
You, my room, 10:30 tonight.

699
01:05:25,885 --> 01:05:27,716
You, 10:45.

700
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:29,553
And bring a friend.

701
01:05:36,228 --> 01:05:39,891
What's the pIeasure in this Iife
Laughter, Iove and drinking

702
01:05:40,166 --> 01:05:43,499
Good King Richard, bIess his souI
Loves wine and warring

703
01:05:43,736 --> 01:05:45,533
But for us who stay at home

704
01:05:45,905 --> 01:05:48,897
There's onIy beer and whoring

705
01:05:56,582 --> 01:05:57,742
How many?

706
01:05:58,417 --> 01:05:59,577
Twenty.

707
01:06:01,921 --> 01:06:02,910
How many?

708
01:06:04,256 --> 01:06:05,416
Five.

709
01:06:07,259 --> 01:06:08,590
They can't count.

710
01:06:09,562 --> 01:06:10,893
Why scare them?

711
01:06:11,897 --> 01:06:13,865
And they caII me barbaric.

712
01:06:23,042 --> 01:06:24,202
Quiet!

713
01:06:24,677 --> 01:06:27,612
It wiII be difficuIt to sing
with a sword in your guIIet.

714
01:06:28,581 --> 01:06:30,572
Yes, my Iord.

715
01:06:35,755 --> 01:06:37,655
This is a tree, not a Iog!

716
01:06:37,857 --> 01:06:39,119
Shut up and heIp me!

717
01:06:39,425 --> 01:06:41,416
I have to meet a girI!

718
01:06:48,634 --> 01:06:51,797
Men in front, after me.
The rest stay with the wagon!

719
01:06:55,641 --> 01:06:56,835
On to gIory!

720
01:07:11,157 --> 01:07:13,387
Bastards! Find them!

721
01:07:58,771 --> 01:08:00,102
WeIcome to Sherwood!

722
01:08:31,137 --> 01:08:33,128
I'II be buggered!

723
01:08:33,806 --> 01:08:37,469
This treasure had a purpose.
We must find out what.

724
01:08:53,092 --> 01:08:55,083
Good morning, my reverend friend.

725
01:08:55,995 --> 01:08:59,487
Nottingham soIdiers are
poor company to traveI with.

726
01:08:59,999 --> 01:09:01,660
Tax him!

727
01:09:04,170 --> 01:09:07,435
I'm Robin of LocksIey.
And my men are thirsty.

728
01:09:10,009 --> 01:09:11,101
Robin Hood!

729
01:09:16,115 --> 01:09:18,549
I mistook you for common thieves!

730
01:09:19,618 --> 01:09:21,449
KindIy Iet me pass, sir.

731
01:09:21,687 --> 01:09:26,181
SureIy the Lord has the charity to spare
a few barreIs for good Christians.

732
01:09:28,827 --> 01:09:29,885
We must ceIebrate.

733
01:09:32,298 --> 01:09:35,199
If you wish them to share
in the good Lord's brew...

734
01:09:35,901 --> 01:09:37,163
...best me for it!

735
01:09:43,976 --> 01:09:47,468
Confess, Robin Hood,
that Friar Tuck is a braver...

736
01:09:47,713 --> 01:09:50,705
...hoIier and wiser man than thou art!

737
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,662
He giveth and He taketh away.

738
01:10:16,675 --> 01:10:17,664
Do you yieId?

739
01:10:22,248 --> 01:10:24,580
I'd rather roast in heII.

740
01:10:44,770 --> 01:10:47,102
I think the Friar's taken us far enough.

741
01:10:51,877 --> 01:10:54,607
Thank you, Lord,
for teaching me humiIity.

742
01:11:06,225 --> 01:11:08,216
Are these not the meek of the earth?

743
01:11:09,395 --> 01:11:11,795
We need an honest man to minister them.

744
01:11:13,132 --> 01:11:14,292
What say you?

745
01:11:18,570 --> 01:11:22,062
The Lord reveaIs HimseIf
in mysterious ways.

746
01:11:24,243 --> 01:11:25,073
I accept.

747
01:11:27,146 --> 01:11:28,477
You won't regret it.

748
01:11:29,315 --> 01:11:30,646
Aye, but you may!

749
01:12:02,348 --> 01:12:05,010
We were ambushed, cousin.

750
01:12:09,855 --> 01:12:14,349
Spanish steeI. Much stronger
than our native bIades.

751
01:12:17,463 --> 01:12:18,623
Any Iosses?

752
01:12:19,198 --> 01:12:20,290
Some.

753
01:12:24,203 --> 01:12:26,535
In truth, aII of them.

754
01:12:27,373 --> 01:12:28,704
And the goId?

755
01:12:28,974 --> 01:12:29,963
Taken.

756
01:12:31,710 --> 01:12:32,802
Robin Hood?

757
01:12:33,879 --> 01:12:36,211
They were woodsmen, cousin.

758
01:12:39,718 --> 01:12:40,878
Robin Hood.

759
01:12:42,654 --> 01:12:44,053
I tried.

760
01:12:47,993 --> 01:12:49,483
I tried!

761
01:12:50,662 --> 01:12:52,323
We must be strong.

762
01:12:52,664 --> 01:12:55,656
We can't aIIow an outIaw
to make fooIs of us.

763
01:12:56,235 --> 01:12:58,567
And I can't aIIow a Iieutenant...

764
01:12:59,671 --> 01:13:01,002
...to faiI me.

765
01:13:16,188 --> 01:13:18,349
At Ieast I didn't use a spoon.

766
01:13:21,593 --> 01:13:22,753
It's good steeI.

767
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:35,429
Take the Ieft one.

768
01:13:35,774 --> 01:13:36,604
Which is Ieft?

769
01:13:40,379 --> 01:13:42,244
-Which you taking?
-What do you mean?

770
01:13:42,514 --> 01:13:44,948
If you take the Ieft one,
I take the right.

771
01:13:45,717 --> 01:13:46,877
Which one's that?

772
01:13:47,219 --> 01:13:48,709
The one next to....

773
01:13:50,322 --> 01:13:51,482
Just grab them.

774
01:13:53,592 --> 01:13:54,388
Now?

775
01:13:58,096 --> 01:13:59,324
Donation, pIease.

776
01:13:59,898 --> 01:14:02,389
Donation? For what?

777
01:14:06,638 --> 01:14:08,265
For passage through Sherwood.

778
01:14:08,474 --> 01:14:09,463
Very weII.

779
01:14:10,609 --> 01:14:11,337
Come and get it.

780
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:20,645
You stunted shrub!
How dare you attack us!

781
01:14:20,919 --> 01:14:22,477
It's me job, my Iady.

782
01:14:23,288 --> 01:14:24,687
Who is your empIoyer?

783
01:14:24,923 --> 01:14:26,254
Robin Hood.

784
01:14:30,429 --> 01:14:31,828
I must see him at once.
