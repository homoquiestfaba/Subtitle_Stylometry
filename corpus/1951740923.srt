Slow down Sam, slowdown.

5
00:03:59,015 --> 00:04:01,695
Wow!
- We must show this to the sheriff.

6
00:04:08,474 --> 00:04:10,888
Come on, let's go, go!

7
00:04:16,604 --> 00:04:18,830
Move, go, go, go!

8
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,066
Sam, you're all right?

9
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,644
I'm scared!

10

Wuh? wa...

14

Come on, I'll give you a ride.

15
00:07:40,897 --> 00:07:42,761
I usually ride in the back.

16
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:45,377
It seems you remember you're being with me
a couple of those times.

17
00:07:45,453 --> 00:07:47,511
You've got work lined up?

18
00:07:47,787 --> 00:07:59,709
Why? You hiring?

19
00:07:50,785 --> 00:07:57,158
I had enough trouble convincing people I belonged
in the job, but I'll ask around town for you.

20
00:07:57,235 --> 00:07:59,470
I appreciate it.

21
00:08:00,059 --> 00:08:03,946
You, uh, seen my brother?

22
00:08:04,242 --> 00:08:07,360
Actually, I've been seeing him too much.

23
00:08:14,456 --> 00:08:16,789
You gotta wear the hat.

24
00:08:17,317 --> 00:08:19,689
Drew, the only reason you make us wear a hat is because


25
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:22,768
the manager made you wear a hat when you were drunk. 

26
00:08:22,844 --> 00:08:24,698
Look, the only reason you got this job,

27
00:08:24,774 --> 00:08:28,349
is because the guidance counsellor begged me to give it to you

28
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:32,222
Yes, I'm sure the fact that she is hot has nothing to do with that huh.

I can' make that delivery, I can' do it.

This is no democracy.
Make the run or you are fired.

32
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,743
And wear the hat!

Harry, we keep telling you guys to stay out of here and you keep coming back.

I hate to do this , but I'm gonna have to take you in.

Let me just get my dog.
Butch!

Hey, Ricky.
-- Hi, Jesse.

Come on in

43
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:06,140
Can we get you something to drink?

44
00:11:06,216 --> 00:11:07,730
I'm good, thanks.

45
00:11:07,806 --> 00:11:12,395
Cute outfit, Rick.
-- Yes, isn't Halloween in October?

46
00:11:13,088 --> 00:11:16,659
Yes now I know who's ordered the "Sausage Lovers" (pizza).

I'm sorry.
He is such an a**hole.

Yeah, well, you always know how to pick 'em, Jess.

50
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,426
Well now you and I have a little secret...

51
00:11:34,502 --> 00:11:37,737
I am getting ready to fire him.

52
00:11:37,813 --> 00:11:41,252
Fire him. That's funny.

53

Nothing. Anyone parked at the turn-out?

You've got problem with the door?

82
00:16:08,454 --> 00:16:11,229
When did you get back?
-- Today.

83
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:14,110
What happened to your face?

Dale Collins and his friends jolted me.

88
00:16:27,818 --> 00:16:30,311
And threw my keys in the sewer.

Do you remember all those times you told me,
how you missed your mom.

103
00:23:45,245 --> 00:23:48,542
It's OK to tell Mommy that.

104
00:23:51,373 --> 00:23:53,767
Ok.

105

-- You're the convict in the family.

Very funny.
Help me with this, okay?

108
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:16,457
Why don't we climb down where they threw
your keys.

109
00:24:16,533 --> 00:24:20,424
So that Jessie can see me climb out
covered in shit? No, thanks.

110
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:22,776
Amazing. We're gonna be covered in shit?

111
00:24:22,852 --> 00:24:25,714
Take this.

112
00:24:37,403 --> 00:24:42,459
It's gross down here.
-- No, I could think of worse places.

113
00:24:57,944 --> 00:25:00,332
I guess nobody's home
-- Is that a couch?

114
00:25:00,408 --> 00:25:04,651
Yeah, it's nicer than ours.

Are you sure this is the right way?

00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:41,320
It should be right up here.

- Check down there.

- Yes, and I'm not sticking it in that shit.

Tel me about this girl.
- What girl?

125
00:26:12,873 --> 00:26:17,004
The one you got your ass kicked over.
- She's the girl.

126

Nobody goes around digging in shit just for
a girl, okay.

127

- Relax, just a rat.

are out here, somewhere.

They wouldn't stop looking for me.

Do you think that...something happened?
- I dunno.

146
00:28:34,981 --> 00:28:37,615
Why don't you go home and get some rest.

147
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:41,068
You'll need your strength.

148

How is the job hunt going?

Is "breaking and entering" a special skill?

Do you have a suggestion?

00:33:29,985 --> 00:33:32,912
You know, you looked at me the same way
in class.

180
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:37,944
Yeah, well, the clock's  behind you.
- What?

181
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:41,770
Tomorrow when you're in class, turn around.

182
00:33:41,846 --> 00:33:49,950
Yes, I know its there, but
we both know that not what you're looking at.

183
00:33:52,551 --> 00:33:55,861
You know, you never were a good liar.

184
00:33:57,961 --> 00:34:01,453
Do you want to go swimming tonight?
- Swimming?

185
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:04,988
Where?
- At school.

186
00:34:05,449 --> 00:34:08,171
Come on, it will be like old times.

187
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:12,256
Old time like before you had a boyfriend?

188
00:34:14,711 --> 00:34:17,726
Yeah, and he's ex-boyfriend actually.

189
00:34:18,472 --> 00:34:21,019
He's been fired?

190
00:34:22,108 --> 00:34:25,649
So, tonight, around 10pm.

191
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,950
See you tonight.

192
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:09,445
We're closing now.
- I'll see you whan you get here.

193
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:19,398
You're all right?

194
00:39:21,013 --> 00:39:24,029
If you want talk.

195
00:39:24,422 --> 00:39:27,177
It's OK.

196
00:39:28,524 --> 00:39:31,477
You're welcomed to stay with me and Cathy tonight

197
00:39:31,553 --> 00:39:34,876
Darcy's coming by to pick me up.
I'll sleep at hers.

198
00:39:36,691 --> 00:39:39,924
I'll see you tomorrow.

199
00:41:08,922 --> 00:41:14,138
We found Ray's body in the woods.
It was odd.

200
00:41:14,214 --> 00:41:17,607
He was skinned alive.

201
00:41:20,793 --> 00:41:25,530
Do you think it's got something to do with
Buddy and his kid disappearing?

202
00:41:26,163 --> 00:41:29,092
I think this kind of thing doesn't happen here.

203
00:41:29,168 --> 00:41:34,049
[Radio} Sheriff, we have report of a small gas explosion
in the sewer on 16th Street, do you copy?

204
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:37,817
Roger dispatch, notify the Fire Dept.
I will meet them there.

205
00:41:37,893 --> 00:41:39,460
[Radio] Right away, Sheriff. Dispatch out.

206
00:41:39,536 --> 00:41:42,951
Do you need some help?
- I don't know Dallas.

207
00:41:43,095 --> 00:41:47,836
Come on, I'll ride in the back.

208
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:09,108
So...

209
00:43:09,386 --> 00:43:11,943
How do we get in?

210
00:43:12,019 --> 00:43:15,030
I've taped up the lock, after class.

211
00:43:35,658 --> 00:43:41,124
I couldn't decide on which suit
I wanted to wear, so...

212
00:43:46,585 --> 00:43:49,001
Now, you tell me...

213
00:43:49,641 --> 00:43:55,282
Are you looking at me or the clock?

214
00:43:59,384 --> 00:44:02,326
Come here.

215
00:44:24,725 --> 00:44:28,091
What do you think you're doing, Jess?
- Dale, get out of here.

216
00:44:28,167 --> 00:44:30,182
Just remember, Ricky.

217
00:44:30,258 --> 00:44:33,859
I taught this s**t everything she knows.

218
00:44:33,935 --> 00:44:36,620
No, Ricky, stop it!

219
00:44:37,513 --> 00:44:39,572
Stop it. Dale, stop it.

220
00:44:39,648 --> 00:44:42,666
Stop it, he's drowning.

221
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:12,954
What the hell was that?

222
00:46:13,338 --> 00:46:16,141
Oh my God, get out of the water.

223
00:46:16,217 --> 00:46:19,222
Jess, go.
Go.

224
00:46:19,495 --> 00:46:22,392
Get out of the pool.

225
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:24,206
Help me.

226
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:27,559
Help me.

227
00:46:29,448 --> 00:46:32,541
This side.

228
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:36,929
Is Ricky dead?
- Why don't you go back and find out.

229
00:46:37,005 --> 00:46:39,973
Come, let's go.
- Go.

230
00:46:42,161 --> 00:46:45,125
Window.

231
00:46:55,183 --> 00:46:56,540
Come on.

232
00:46:56,616 --> 00:46:59,020
Help me.

233
00:47:03,012 --> 00:47:05,811
Go.

234
00:47:24,811 --> 00:47:27,988
Daddy.

235
00:47:28,064 --> 00:47:31,613
Daddy.
- What is it?

236
00:47:31,832 --> 00:47:34,345
It was outside the window.

237
00:47:34,421 --> 00:47:37,834
What?
- Some monster.

238
00:47:39,434 --> 00:47:42,608
Come here.

239
00:47:45,023 --> 00:47:49,573
When I was your age, I used to have
these awful nightmares.

240
00:47:49,649 --> 00:47:53,146
I saw it.
It was real.

241
00:47:54,809 --> 00:47:58,337
See. No monster.

242
00:48:01,468 --> 00:48:04,034
Daddy!

243
00:48:08,871 --> 00:48:12,801
We have to go. Come on.
-- Daddy!

244
00:49:10,055 --> 00:49:13,929
The fire's spread to the whole plant.
We have to shut down the reactors manually.

245
00:49:14,005 --> 00:49:16,211
Roger that.

246
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:20,310
Dispatch?
We have to evacuate the entire town.

247
00:49:20,386 --> 00:49:23,833
Call the National Guard
in Colorado Springfield for assistance, over.

248
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:25,198
Copy that.

249
00:49:25,274 --> 00:49:27,433
Jesus.

250
00:49:27,509 --> 00:49:28,835
Sheriff.
- Yes?

251
00:49:28,911 --> 00:49:30,284
I think you should hear about this...

252
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,402
Dallas.
- OK, thanks a lot.

253
00:49:32,478 --> 00:49:34,882
I saw something came up to us,
I don't know what happened.

254
00:49:34,959 --> 00:49:37,406
What do you mean something came up.
- Where were you?

255
00:49:37,482 --> 00:49:38,757
Slow down, where were you?
- I don't know.

256
00:49:38,833 --> 00:49:40,625
Where were you?
- We went to school.

257
00:49:40,701 --> 00:49:43,577
Mark, he's dead.
I think they got Nick too.

258
00:49:43,654 --> 00:49:47,008
What was it?
Ricky?

259
00:49:47,789 --> 00:49:50,556
I don't know.

260
00:50:50,744 --> 00:50:55,186
Call help.
Somebody's gota know about this.

261
00:50:56,363 --> 00:50:58,779
Eddie.

262
00:51:01,668 --> 00:51:06,111
Dispatch, where's our backup?
Dipatch, come in!

263
00:51:08,993 --> 00:51:11,873
Dispatch, come in.

264
00:51:13,431 --> 00:51:16,364
Let's go. Let's get the hell out of here.

265
00:51:26,301 --> 00:51:29,180
Carrie, the power's out.

266
00:51:39,835 --> 00:51:43,102
Help me!

267
00:52:48,712 --> 00:52:51,296
I don't think the police station
is not such a hot idea.

268
00:52:51,573 --> 00:52:55,120
What do you want me to do?
We do not know what we're dealing here.

269
00:52:55,196 --> 00:52:58,363
Come on.
- Look out.

270
00:53:00,386 --> 00:53:01,881
Sheriff.

271
00:53:01,957 --> 00:53:04,776
Darcy? Darcy, what happened?
What are you doing?

272
00:53:04,853 --> 00:53:06,082
Eddy, you must...
- What?

273
00:53:06,158 --> 00:53:08,608
[Incoherent] Carrie are also here.
They're all covered in blood.

274
00:53:08,684 --> 00:53:14,714
They're all gone.
She is dead.

275
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:19,988
Ricky, get her inside.
Get her in.

276
00:53:22,026 --> 00:53:24,998
People are dying.

277
00:53:25,074 --> 00:53:26,952
We need guns.

278
00:53:27,028 --> 00:53:32,013
The National Guard will be here soon.
- Not soon enough.

279
00:53:41,288 --> 00:53:43,710
I can't believe I'm letting you do this.

280
00:53:43,786 --> 00:53:46,836
This plan is stupid.
Let's just leave town now.

281
00:53:46,912 --> 00:53:49,243
We're not gonna make it without weapons.

282
00:53:49,319 --> 00:53:53,428
You are too stupid to talk,
Dale, just shut up.

283
00:54:08,038 --> 00:54:11,508
Where are the guns?
- Follow me.

284
00:54:20,185 --> 00:54:22,834
Here they are.

285
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:29,456
Dale, get some bags.
Jessie, load them up.

286
00:54:33,184 --> 00:54:36,766
Eddy, you got power on that thing?

287
00:54:36,842 --> 00:54:40,314
Yes, I just need some light.

288
00:54:54,472 --> 00:54:55,903
Go, go, go.

289
00:54:55,979 --> 00:55:01,381
0-1, scout the area.
0-2 secure the perimeter....[indistinctive]

290
00:55:01,457 --> 00:55:03,015
Roger.
0-6 out.

291
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:04,678
Move. Move.

292
00:55:04,754 --> 00:55:07,938
What's your status
0-1 has the area secured.

293
00:55:08,014 --> 00:55:11,021
0-2 has secured the perimeter.

294
00:55:14,566 --> 00:55:17,294
This is Sheriff Morales, to the National Guard,
come in.

295
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:19,922
Repeat, Sheriff Morales, to the National Guard,
come in.

296
00:55:19,998 --> 00:55:24,228
This is Lieutenant Wood, 89th Troop Commander
Colorado National Guard.

297
00:55:24,304 --> 00:55:26,098
Go ahead, Sheriff.

298
00:55:26,174 --> 00:55:28,634
What is your location, Lieutenant, over?

299
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:30,736
We are on Main Street.

300
00:55:30,813 --> 00:55:32,873
Look, Lieutenant, I don't know what
your men is walking into.

301
00:55:32,949 --> 00:55:36,656
But our situation is getting worse.

302
00:55:43,853 --> 00:55:46,332
Lieutenant, come in.
Are you there?

303
00:55:46,408 --> 00:55:50,127
We've a missing man.
- Hold on, sheriff.

304
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:13,645
We've got gunshots...[indistinct chatter]
We've been ambushed!

305
00:56:17,137 --> 00:56:20,132
What the hell's going on out there?

306
00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:32,867
Pull back.
I repeat, pull back.

307
00:56:32,943 --> 00:56:35,340
Lieutenant.

308
00:56:43,364 --> 00:56:46,243
Lieutenant, are you there?
[Static]

309
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:49,376
Lieutenant, come in.
Are you there?

310
00:56:57,121 --> 00:57:00,057
We're not gonna make it are we?

311
00:57:08,322 --> 00:57:10,254
Don't shoot, take what you want.

312
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:14,212
I'm not gonna get killed for USD 6.25 an hour.

313
00:57:16,355 --> 00:57:20,727
We've been attacked.
- Terrorists had done this sir?

314
00:57:20,802 --> 00:57:24,251
I told you they would, one day.

315
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:27,645
What you guys, stoned?

316
00:57:30,737 --> 00:57:33,533
Do you see that?

317
00:57:50,656 --> 00:57:53,301
Are you hurt?

318
00:57:54,835 --> 00:57:56,587
Come on in.

319
00:57:56,663 --> 00:57:59,858
It should be safe here.

320
00:58:12,761 --> 00:58:15,015
Hold on.

321
00:58:16,667 --> 00:58:20,142
No pulse and breathing.
Take him straight to intensive care.

322
00:59:02,722 --> 00:59:04,653
When's the light going back on?

323
00:59:04,730 --> 00:59:09,525
We are on emergency generators, until the
power's restored.

324
00:59:12,412 --> 00:59:15,635
I think my water just broke.

325
00:59:15,711 --> 00:59:19,283
Okay, I will find the doctor.

326
01:00:03,381 --> 01:00:08,437
You two look pretty shaken up.
- Hasn't been an easy night for her.

327
01:00:10,997 --> 01:00:13,791
And what about you?

328
01:00:14,242 --> 01:00:17,237
I'll live.

329
01:00:21,291 --> 01:00:24,233
We're leaving in 5 minutes.

330
01:00:24,453 --> 01:00:27,065
Thank you.

331
01:00:47,552 --> 01:00:49,837
Where is he?

332
01:01:01,425 --> 01:01:04,783
Give me the gun.

333
01:01:09,412 --> 01:01:11,959
Come on.

334
01:01:20,855 --> 01:01:23,275
Mummy.

335
01:01:26,525 --> 01:01:28,869
Turn back.
It's a trap.

336
01:01:28,945 --> 01:01:30,961
It's a trap.
It's a trap.

337
01:01:33,528 --> 01:01:37,650
Go.
-- Molly, come on, run. Run.

338
01:01:40,044 --> 01:01:43,183
Come here.
- My God.

339
01:01:43,504 --> 01:01:45,907
F**k this.

340
01:01:53,544 --> 01:01:57,058
What is this f**king s**t?

341
01:02:04,013 --> 01:02:07,519
What was that thing?

342
01:02:38,638 --> 01:02:41,485
That's not possible.

343
01:02:41,947 --> 01:02:45,344
Something's wrong.
Check the other room.

344
01:03:30,628 --> 01:03:33,400
Straight ahead.
Straight ahead.

345
01:03:33,567 --> 01:03:38,567
What the hell?
- This is our help?

346
01:03:41,439 --> 01:03:43,506
What the f**k is going on, Eddie?

347
01:03:43,582 --> 01:03:46,045
Where are all the bodies?
- They are gonna kill us all.

348
01:03:46,121 --> 01:03:47,818
We are not dead yet.

349
01:03:47,894 --> 01:03:52,115
There may be weapons we can still use.

350
01:03:59,143 --> 01:04:01,946
Radio.

351
01:04:06,992 --> 01:04:09,704
National Guard, come in.

352
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:14,663
Repeat, any National Guard unit,
come in.

353
01:04:14,739 --> 01:04:18,519
This is Colonel Stevens, US Army.
Identify yourself.

354
01:04:18,595 --> 01:04:21,261
Sheriff Eddie Morales,
in Colorado.

355
01:04:21,337 --> 01:04:24,282
You must help us, Colonel.
We have here a kind of infestation.

356
01:04:24,359 --> 01:04:27,167
And if we don't get help soon,
there won't be any of us left.

357
01:04:27,243 --> 01:04:30,495
What's the Army's evacuation plan?

358
01:04:30,571 --> 01:04:33,074
Colonel?

359
01:04:35,909 --> 01:04:38,673
Colonel, we need immediate evac.

360
01:04:38,749 --> 01:04:41,597
Sheriff, all ground routes have been compromised.

361
01:04:41,674 --> 01:04:45,860
There is an airlift, in 30 minutes
from Gilliam Circle.

362
01:04:45,936 --> 01:04:50,097
Confirmed. Airlift. Gilliam Circle.
We will be there in 20 minutes.

363
01:04:50,173 --> 01:04:52,392
But that's right in the centre of town.

364
01:04:52,553 --> 01:04:55,432
We will be there, Colonel.

365
01:05:03,361 --> 01:05:07,132
What the f**k are you.

366
01:05:11,836 --> 01:05:17,175
Everyone, get in the APC. I'll drive.

367
01:05:20,155 --> 01:05:23,103
Do you think you can drive that thing?

368
01:05:23,179 --> 01:05:26,121
I will get on the gun.
- Don't miss.

369
01:05:26,197 --> 01:05:28,647
Don't crash.

370
01:05:36,428 --> 01:05:39,370
Hold on.

371
01:07:14,882 --> 01:07:18,518
Why are we stopping?
- It doesn't make any sense.

372
01:07:18,594 --> 01:07:21,417
Gillian Circle is right in the centre of town.

373
01:07:21,493 --> 01:07:24,307
We will be surrounded by those things.

374
01:07:24,383 --> 01:07:27,926
Why are you saying?
- I think that the Colonel is lying.

375
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:32,801
But that is crazy.
The government doesn't never lie to people.

376
01:07:33,053 --> 01:07:37,415
The army thinks about containment first.
They can't risk this getting worse.

377
01:07:37,491 --> 01:07:40,734
But a few miles down that road,
there will be waiting for us.

378
01:07:40,811 --> 01:07:42,533
If you don't wanna drive us there,
I will.

379
01:07:42,609 --> 01:07:45,136
if she is right, then the only thing down that
road is more of these things.

380
01:07:45,212 --> 01:07:48,262
You're not seriously considering this?
- I'm considering whatever keeps us alive.

381
01:07:48,338 --> 01:07:51,806
Which means getting out of this town.

382
01:07:51,883 --> 01:07:54,047
There are only two helicopters in town.
One is at the airport..

383
01:07:54,123 --> 01:07:57,239
No, that's too far. We'll never make it there.
- The other is at the hospital.

384
01:07:57,315 --> 01:08:00,393
The people at the hospital probably used
it to get out.

385
01:08:00,469 --> 01:08:01,920
That's a chance we have to take.

386
01:08:01,996 --> 01:08:05,325
If you have wrong and the helicopter
is gone, we're all dead.

387
01:08:05,401 --> 01:08:09,866
If I am right, they'll die if they follow you.

388
01:08:14,648 --> 01:08:17,644
There's a truck coming.

389
01:08:27,742 --> 01:08:30,674
Dallas, what the hell are you doing in there?
- Never mind that.

390
01:08:30,750 --> 01:08:32,698
You guys heading to the air lift?
- Yes.

391
01:08:32,774 --> 01:08:35,268
Follow us.
We don't have much time.

392
01:08:35,344 --> 01:08:39,954
Listen up.
Everybody's gotta choose right now.

393
01:08:41,937 --> 01:08:44,665
We're going to the hospital with the tank.

394
01:08:44,742 --> 01:08:47,360
We're going to the center of the town.
- That is right.

395
01:08:47,436 --> 01:08:49,454
I'm going with my brother.
- I'll go along with you.

396
01:08:49,530 --> 01:08:51,737
I'm going in the tank.

397
01:08:51,814 --> 01:08:54,401
Dallas, don't do this.

398
01:08:54,477 --> 01:08:57,464
She's wrong.
And brother or not, he's wrong.

399
01:08:57,540 --> 01:08:58,768
You're gonna get them killed.

400
01:08:58,844 --> 01:09:01,018
We are running out of time, Sheriff,
We gotta move now.

401
01:09:01,094 --> 01:09:04,623
Hold on.
We're coming with you.

402
01:09:07,841 --> 01:09:11,275
Wait.

403
01:09:14,781 --> 01:09:17,113
Take care.

404
01:09:18,354 --> 01:09:22,235
I hope we're both wrong.

405
01:09:29,950 --> 01:09:32,336
Lets go.

406
01:09:51,688 --> 01:09:56,538
I didn't help anybody.
I was too scared.

407
01:09:56,614 --> 01:09:59,963
I just watched them die.

408
01:10:09,904 --> 01:10:13,038
All right, put these on.

409
01:10:13,833 --> 01:10:16,740
You too.

410
01:10:42,555 --> 01:10:44,781
All right, listen.

411
01:10:44,857 --> 01:10:49,723
Whatever happens inside, the only person
who can't get hurt is Kelly. We all protect Kelly.

412
01:10:50,166 --> 01:10:53,544
What is this, the Titanic? Screw the
"women and children first", man.

413
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:56,533
Look, a**hole, unless you can
fly the helicopter, shut up.

414
01:10:56,609 --> 01:10:59,157
Let's go, now.

415
01:11:50,211 --> 01:11:53,388
Maybe they are all gone.

416
01:13:35,714 --> 01:13:38,535
Shoot it!

417
01:13:44,277 --> 01:13:47,721
Jesse, no wait.
- Move, now.

418
01:14:52,592 --> 01:14:56,233
Jesse, wait.

419
01:15:25,846 --> 01:15:28,360
Ricky, wait.
Mother...

420
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:58,990
Come on.

421
01:15:59,345 --> 01:16:01,950
Come on, get up.

422
01:16:02,026 --> 01:16:04,559
You're gonna make it.

423
01:16:08,867 --> 01:16:11,948
We have to go.
Now.

424
01:16:13,766 --> 01:16:16,975
Go. Go. Go. Go.

425
01:16:21,067 --> 01:16:24,786
[Indistinct shouting]

426
01:16:30,272 --> 01:16:32,670
Is this everybody?
- This is all that's left.

427
01:16:32,747 --> 01:16:36,341
What have you heard?
- The air lift will be here soon.

428
01:16:40,207 --> 01:16:42,690
Clear!

429
01:16:43,787 --> 01:16:47,370
Come. Go go. You're all right?
- Yes.

430
01:16:49,572 --> 01:16:51,969
Come here.

431
01:16:52,045 --> 01:16:55,804
Go go.
Follow your mom.

432
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:59,668
Come on.
- Everyone, move.

433
01:17:00,331 --> 01:17:02,832
Run Molly.

434
01:17:15,951 --> 01:17:19,411
Dallas.
- I'm trying.

435
01:17:20,145 --> 01:17:24,246
Are you going to use that thing?
- Hang on.

436
01:17:28,741 --> 01:17:31,345
Lets go.

437
01:17:37,888 --> 01:17:40,377
You got her?

438
01:17:53,841 --> 01:17:56,284
Colonel Stevens? This is Gunnison County...

439
01:17:56,361 --> 01:18:00,014
requesting status on your evac, over.

440
01:18:05,035 --> 01:18:08,098
Colonel, where's the air lift.

441
01:18:08,175 --> 01:18:13,496
Sheriff, we are still 10 miles out.
Hold your position, over.

442
01:18:13,572 --> 01:18:17,134
Colonel, we're here over.

443
01:18:18,931 --> 01:18:21,639
God help us all.

444
01:18:21,715 --> 01:18:24,548
Okay, get out of here, now.
I will buy us some time.

445
01:18:24,624 --> 01:18:27,439
I'm not leaving you.
- Get to the chopper.

446
01:18:27,515 --> 01:18:29,544
You don't have to do this, Dallas.

447
01:18:29,620 --> 01:18:32,515
Now. Go, go.

448
01:18:32,591 --> 01:18:35,904
Come on, you motherf**kers.

449
01:18:39,839 --> 01:18:42,871
Come, over here.

450
01:18:54,705 --> 01:18:57,501
Come on.

451
01:19:02,328 --> 01:19:05,285
OK, go.

452
01:19:10,835 --> 01:19:13,752
Come on over here.

453
01:20:48,057 --> 01:20:51,202
We're not leaving without him.
- We have to go.

454
01:20:51,278 --> 01:20:54,432
He will make it.

455
01:20:57,678 --> 01:21:00,762
Die.

456
01:21:21,288 --> 01:21:24,105
Let's go.

457
01:23:59,988 --> 01:24:02,986
Close your eyes.

458
01:24:07,089 --> 01:24:08,635
Hang on.
- Mummy.

459
01:24:08,711 --> 01:24:12,130
Hang on.

460
01:24:34,364 --> 01:24:40,176
Hey, you're all right? Ricky?
- Press here, yes, hard.

461
01:24:59,793 --> 01:25:03,124
Drop your weapons.

462
01:25:12,041 --> 01:25:16,206
You killed the whole town.
- We're just following orders.

463
01:25:16,282 --> 01:25:19,345
Put down your weapons.

464
01:25:39,330 --> 01:25:42,468
We need a medic, for my brother.

465
01:25:42,544 --> 01:25:44,201
Medivac is inbound.

466
01:25:44,277 --> 01:25:48,220
Secure any weapons and let set up a 
perimeter.

467
01:25:48,297 --> 01:25:50,685
Go, move it.

468
01:26:12,375 --> 01:26:16,552
I told you not to crash.

469
01:26:19,700 --> 01:26:22,093
Mummy?

470
01:26:22,171 --> 01:26:25,360
Are the monsters' gone?

471
01:26:25,436 --> 01:26:28,741
They are gone.

472
01:27:19,623 --> 01:27:23,336
The world isn't ready
for this technology.

473
01:27:24,134 --> 01:27:30,080
But this isn't for our world, is it Miss Yutani?
