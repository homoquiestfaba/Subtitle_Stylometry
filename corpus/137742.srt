1
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,283
Dad, back there. We hit it.

2
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:05,484
No, we didn't hit it. Come on.

3
00:04:11,634 --> 00:04:14,467
-Where is he?.
-Listen. Over there.

4
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,501
-See it?.
-Come on. Come on.

5
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,103
-Over there, look.
-Yeah.

6
00:04:19,308 --> 00:04:20,969
Go around behind.

7
00:04:23,045 --> 00:04:24,979
-Got it!
-Xan! Xan! Here!

8
00:04:25,147 --> 00:04:27,411
Here! Here!

9
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:32,014
Slow down, you!

10
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:35,721
All right, what's that?.

11
00:04:36,826 --> 00:04:39,124
How the devil did
you get out here, fella?.

12
00:04:40,262 --> 00:04:42,526
-He's shaking like a leaf. See that?.
-Yep.

13
00:04:42,698 --> 00:04:44,859
-You think he's lost, what?.
-Yeah.

14
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:47,400
-Yeah?.
-See his mom?.

15
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,333
No.

16
00:04:49,505 --> 00:04:50,972
Well....

17
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,630
I think you're right, yeah.

18
00:04:52,808 --> 00:04:55,242
Come here, you.
Here, take him. Take him.

19
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,948
Hey, you.

20
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:14,994
How's he doing?. He's hungry, huh?.

21
00:05:24,006 --> 00:05:26,270
What on earth are you doing?.

22
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:28,176
Watch and learn, my friend.

23
00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:35,317
Ice cream goes in here.

24
00:05:35,484 --> 00:05:37,577
Flower goes on top.

25
00:05:37,753 --> 00:05:39,482
Baby bottle.

26
00:05:40,956 --> 00:05:42,389
Enjoy.

27
00:05:42,558 --> 00:05:43,889
Cheers.

28
00:05:52,501 --> 00:05:56,198
-He's a feisty guy.
-Yeah. And voila.

29
00:06:01,677 --> 00:06:03,702
He's drinking.

30
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,505
-His face. Black streaks.
-Yeah.

31
00:06:07,683 --> 00:06:10,117
-You know what that means.
-What?.

32
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:11,776
A cheetah.

33
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:14,252
A cheetah. Yeah.

34
00:06:15,624 --> 00:06:17,888
The world's fastest animal.

35
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,393
From zero to 60 in two seconds.

36
00:06:21,564 --> 00:06:23,657
I bet it's faster than your Porsche.

37
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,198
Maybe.

38
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:28,503
You think we should hang on to him?.

39
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:30,571
Yeah.

40
00:06:33,275 --> 00:06:34,503
Why not?.

41
00:06:34,677 --> 00:06:35,905
Where else is he gonna go?.

42
00:06:37,713 --> 00:06:39,476
Xan?.

43
00:06:39,648 --> 00:06:41,616
We can't keep him forever.

44
00:06:41,784 --> 00:06:44,947
Not any more than your mom
and I can keep you.

45
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,611
He's gonna go back to the world
he came from one day.

46
00:07:09,778 --> 00:07:12,144
Mom! Mom!

47
00:07:13,582 --> 00:07:16,278
-Get it off! Get it off!
-Mom, hurry! It's got Dad!

48
00:07:17,086 --> 00:07:19,919
-It's a monster! Come on! Come on!
-Save yourselves!

49
00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:22,114
-God, it's ripping me apart!
-Xan?.

50
00:07:22,992 --> 00:07:25,392
Stop tearing at me,
you terrible animal. It's--

51
00:07:25,561 --> 00:07:26,926
Oh, hello.

52
00:07:29,798 --> 00:07:31,527
Hello.

53
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,328
-Look what we found.
-And who's this?.

54
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:38,363
That was a close one.

55
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,999
-Not nearly close enough.
-I was almost torn asunder.

56
00:07:42,711 --> 00:07:45,475
-What is this?.
-See what we found?.

57
00:07:48,117 --> 00:07:51,314
I'm glad I'm not his mum.
I'd be heartbroken to lose him.

58
00:07:52,621 --> 00:07:55,613
Hey, sexy mama. Your place or mine?.

59
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,088
What?.

60
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,585
-Dad?.
-Xan.

61
00:07:59,762 --> 00:08:02,788
Did I tell you about teaching
that bird questionable phrases?.

62
00:08:02,965 --> 00:08:05,024
What did I tell you, huh?.

63
00:08:55,784 --> 00:08:57,877
Wait. Wait!

64
00:08:58,053 --> 00:08:59,850
Wait.

65
00:09:01,156 --> 00:09:02,384
Now go.

66
00:09:03,859 --> 00:09:07,955
In Africa, they say that when
you give someone a name...

67
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,360
...they become your responsibility.

68
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:15,961
A proper name should capture
the most important qualities...

69
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:19,164
...and point them
towards a certain kind of life.

70
00:09:21,276 --> 00:09:23,210
I tried different names for the cub...

71
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:26,177
...Iike Fuzzy, Spots or Speedy.

72
00:09:26,348 --> 00:09:28,145
But nothing stuck.

73
00:09:43,632 --> 00:09:46,066
As he became part of our daily lives...

74
00:09:46,235 --> 00:09:48,760
...he got to know
everything around the farm.

75
00:09:48,937 --> 00:09:52,873
And I think he started to feel
like it was his place too.

76
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:57,410
Then Mom thought of Duma,
the Swahili word for cheetah.

77
00:09:59,548 --> 00:10:02,244
We all thought it sounded pretty good.

78
00:10:02,418 --> 00:10:05,353
So then Duma became our responsibility.

79
00:10:22,171 --> 00:10:24,765
-How fast does it go?.
-Don't worry about how fast now.

80
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,840
Don't worry about how fast.

81
00:10:27,009 --> 00:10:29,569
Just worry about how to start, all right?.

82
00:10:29,745 --> 00:10:32,771
-Yeah.
-A little petrol, just a little.

83
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,813
-Press this down.
-And what is that gear?.

84
00:10:35,984 --> 00:10:38,179
One down--
Yeah, one down, four up. All right?.

85
00:10:38,987 --> 00:10:40,454
Put your hand on it.

86
00:10:40,622 --> 00:10:42,886
Let it go. Let it go.

87
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,882
Go ahead.

88
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,852
That's it. Feel that?.

89
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:49,395
-Yep.
-You like that, right?.

90
00:10:49,698 --> 00:10:51,188
All right, hold on.

91
00:10:52,134 --> 00:10:53,965
You want to go fast now?. That's it.

92
00:10:54,136 --> 00:10:55,797
Try one more time.

93
00:10:56,171 --> 00:10:57,763
If you let it out too fast, look.

94
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:01,103
Here, you're popping it like that.
You don't want to do that.

95
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,041
-Tight.
-Pull it to that side.

96
00:11:03,212 --> 00:11:06,409
Tight. Tight.
Pull on it. There you go.

97
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,447
Beauty. One more.

98
00:11:08,617 --> 00:11:09,845
There you are.

99
00:11:10,018 --> 00:11:12,578
One more, one more. Tight, tight.

100
00:11:12,921 --> 00:11:14,252
All right.

101
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,982
Now, wait. Watch it, watch it.

102
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,857
Don't ever underestimate what you
can do with a bit of baling wire.

103
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,657
It's good, eh?.

104
00:11:40,082 --> 00:11:43,381
Come on. Hang on! You got it!

105
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,347
There he goes!

106
00:12:36,238 --> 00:12:38,069
Dad!

107
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,109
Dad!

108
00:12:45,214 --> 00:12:49,947
It seemed impossible that anything bad
could have happened to my dad.

109
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:52,853
Before he got sick...

110
00:12:53,021 --> 00:12:55,489
...he never let anything stop him.

111
00:12:55,657 --> 00:12:57,921
He was always looking
at the bright side.

112
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:07,658
Mom and I took care of the farm
while Dad was in hospital.

113
00:13:07,836 --> 00:13:10,600
The doctor said
he recovered really well...

114
00:13:10,772 --> 00:13:13,434
...and that everything
was going to be okay.

115
00:14:12,534 --> 00:14:15,059
Come on, Duma! Let's give it some stick!

116
00:14:16,371 --> 00:14:18,362
That's 50 K!

117
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,868
Come on, Duma!

118
00:14:20,042 --> 00:14:22,442
Look! There it is!

119
00:14:22,911 --> 00:14:24,879
Look at that stride, now.

120
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,407
-Come on, Duma!
-Come on, boy!

121
00:14:34,723 --> 00:14:36,486
Hey, we're at 60!

122
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,086
Now he's overtaking us!

123
00:14:39,328 --> 00:14:40,659
Seventy, man!

124
00:14:41,229 --> 00:14:42,526
Hang on!

125
00:14:42,698 --> 00:14:44,325
I lost my hat!

126
00:14:47,602 --> 00:14:49,297
Eighty!

127
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,033
Ninety!

128
00:14:51,606 --> 00:14:54,541
-Beauty! You, beauty, you!
-Go, Duma!

129
00:14:56,712 --> 00:14:58,407
-Beauty!
-A hundred, now!

130
00:15:02,117 --> 00:15:04,585
From too much love of living

131
00:15:04,753 --> 00:15:06,983
From hope and fear set free

132
00:15:07,155 --> 00:15:09,680
We thank with brief thanksgiving

133
00:15:09,858 --> 00:15:11,587
Whatever gods may be

134
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,387
Pause...

135
00:15:13,562 --> 00:15:15,393
...after each line.

136
00:15:15,564 --> 00:15:18,158
Read it like you're singing a song.

137
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:21,496
The sound of the words are the melody.

138
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,366
That no life lives forever

139
00:15:24,539 --> 00:15:26,302
That dead men rise up never

140
00:15:26,475 --> 00:15:28,807
That even the weariest river

141
00:15:28,977 --> 00:15:31,241
Winds somewhere safe to sea

142
00:15:35,817 --> 00:15:37,512
Mom?.

143
00:15:41,156 --> 00:15:42,783
I'm sorry.

144
00:15:47,629 --> 00:15:49,893
-Yeah.
-Got any room for me?.

145
00:15:50,065 --> 00:15:51,692
Sure, Dad.

146
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:54,468
So....

147
00:15:54,636 --> 00:15:56,467
We gotta talk about our friend here.

148
00:15:56,638 --> 00:15:58,071
He's almost grown.

149
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,003
-But Duma's--
-Hang on.

150
00:16:00,976 --> 00:16:03,604
He's nearly too old to survive out there.

151
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:07,109
Duma's got to live
the life he was born to.

152
00:16:07,349 --> 00:16:09,510
So we gotta take him back. Now.

153
00:16:09,684 --> 00:16:11,083
He doesn't want to go.

154
00:16:11,253 --> 00:16:12,618
He doesn't want to be wild.

155
00:16:12,788 --> 00:16:15,621
No, you can't decide that for him, Xan.

156
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,991
He's a wild animal. Remember?.

157
00:16:19,494 --> 00:16:21,655
His wildness is something...

158
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,956
...he knows without even knowing it.

159
00:16:24,132 --> 00:16:26,930
It's in his bones. It's in his blood.

160
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,865
Like a memory, yeah?.

161
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,440
Like how I know I belong here...

162
00:16:34,676 --> 00:16:36,109
...on Grandpa's farm.

163
00:16:36,278 --> 00:16:39,213
But there's hardly any cheetahs left.

164
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:42,311
Where else would he go
besides our farm?.

165
00:16:42,484 --> 00:16:44,384
We're here, yeah?.

166
00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:46,812
And then all the way...

167
00:16:46,988 --> 00:16:48,512
...up there.

168
00:16:49,691 --> 00:16:51,659
We found him here.

169
00:16:52,027 --> 00:16:55,656
And just north and west...

170
00:16:55,831 --> 00:16:57,765
...mountains, yeah?.

171
00:17:00,335 --> 00:17:02,166
Little valley.

172
00:17:04,172 --> 00:17:08,108
The river.
Lots of springbok and gazelle.

173
00:17:08,276 --> 00:17:10,073
Big-cat heaven.

174
00:17:10,245 --> 00:17:12,679
Chase, trip, bite. How hard could it be?.

175
00:17:14,015 --> 00:17:16,142
Chase, trip, bite.

176
00:17:17,686 --> 00:17:20,416
So you and I will take him up next week.

177
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:22,580
Okay?. We'll camp out...

178
00:17:22,757 --> 00:17:24,691
...do a bit of fishing.

179
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,192
It'll be lekker, man, send him off.

180
00:18:31,459 --> 00:18:33,051
What happened?.

181
00:18:34,229 --> 00:18:36,060
Where's Dad?.

182
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,197
-Hey, Xan.
-What?.

183
00:19:51,573 --> 00:19:53,803
Honey, we're making some changes.

184
00:19:53,975 --> 00:19:55,499
Like what?.

185
00:19:57,145 --> 00:19:59,409
I have to lease the farm.

186
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,247
We'll still live in the house, won't we?.

187
00:20:03,418 --> 00:20:05,409
No, we're going to the city...

188
00:20:05,587 --> 00:20:08,112
...to live with Aunt Gwen for a while.

189
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,155
I need to get a job.

190
00:20:10,325 --> 00:20:11,952
What about Duma?.

191
00:20:14,863 --> 00:20:16,990
Duma will get a new home as well.

192
00:20:17,165 --> 00:20:20,726
A big preserve where he'll have
lots of room to run around.

193
00:20:20,902 --> 00:20:22,529
Xan, I have to take care of us.

194
00:20:22,704 --> 00:20:26,800
-And the only way I can do that is if we--
-That's not what Dad wanted.

195
00:20:34,649 --> 00:20:36,276
Xan!

196
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:45,650
Xan, your father and I talked about this.

197
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:48,125
It's the only thing we can do.

198
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,791
It's the only thing that makes sense.

199
00:21:10,552 --> 00:21:12,713
I know this is scary.

200
00:21:14,089 --> 00:21:15,818
I know it won't be easy.

201
00:21:17,792 --> 00:21:21,125
We can do this if we stick together, Xan.

202
00:21:45,286 --> 00:21:47,550
Thanks for having us, Gwen.

203
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,820
No worries.

204
00:21:51,826 --> 00:21:55,421
The man from the reserve
will be here in a day or two.

205
00:22:03,538 --> 00:22:05,096
Xan, wait.

206
00:22:06,975 --> 00:22:10,172
All you have to do today is look
around and get the lay of the land.

207
00:22:10,612 --> 00:22:13,672
Those kids don't know
anything you don't know.

208
00:22:23,558 --> 00:22:27,824
You want to be a winner?.
You gotta have passion, passion, fire!

209
00:22:28,897 --> 00:22:30,888
Gentlemen, our day is made.

210
00:22:31,065 --> 00:22:34,364
So, what have we got here?. Have we
got winners, or have we got losers?.

211
00:22:34,536 --> 00:22:37,061
-Winners!
-Let me hear it again. Winners or losers?.

212
00:22:37,238 --> 00:22:38,865
Winners!

213
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,268
Right.

214
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:41,807
Bombardment.

215
00:22:41,976 --> 00:22:43,671
One hit, and you're out.

216
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:01,724
Hello!

217
00:23:02,831 --> 00:23:04,389
I'm going to go pick up Xan.

218
00:23:04,566 --> 00:23:06,966
No worries. He's lovely.

219
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,500
Bye-bye.

220
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,947
-this incredible offer!

221
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:31,758
Look how lovely and creamy--

222
00:23:32,627 --> 00:23:34,527
I tought I taw a puttytat.

223
00:23:34,696 --> 00:23:36,254
Oh, boy.

224
00:23:37,732 --> 00:23:39,757
Hello, breakfast.

225
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,410
Doggy!

226
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:10,293
"There are many theories about how
the ancient Egyptians built the pyramids.

227
00:24:11,065 --> 00:24:15,695
Some people think they used slaves
or unknown machines.

228
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:17,770
I think they used water.

229
00:24:19,974 --> 00:24:21,635
They could have dug canals...

230
00:24:22,143 --> 00:24:27,410
...then loaded the huge,
heavy stone blocks using ropes."

231
00:24:31,786 --> 00:24:33,014
Excuse me, young man...

232
00:24:33,187 --> 00:24:34,848
-...where are you going?.
-Out there.

233
00:24:35,023 --> 00:24:37,685
Nobody leaves my room
without my permission.

234
00:24:43,831 --> 00:24:45,731
-"The Egyptians--"
-Fire drill!

235
00:24:46,301 --> 00:24:49,031
Exit by row! Orderly, please!

236
00:25:13,962 --> 00:25:15,361
Duma?.

237
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:18,629
Duma?.

238
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,097
You in here?.

239
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:21,496
Who's Duma?.

240
00:25:21,803 --> 00:25:23,634
Is that your boyfriend?.

241
00:25:24,138 --> 00:25:25,935
Give me that.

242
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:27,938
Hey, that's mine!

243
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:30,537
That?. That's very nice.

244
00:25:30,812 --> 00:25:32,279
My father gave it to me.

245
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:37,510
And you are going to give it to me
or pay me to let you keep it.

246
00:25:57,905 --> 00:25:59,236
Run!

247
00:26:00,675 --> 00:26:02,108
Good job.

248
00:26:02,844 --> 00:26:04,175
Come on, Duma.

249
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:12,585
Hey, kid! Get down!

250
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:20,927
This is outrageous.

251
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:25,056
Xan!

252
00:26:45,853 --> 00:26:47,582
Come, boy. Come.

253
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:51,158
Come on. Let's get out of here.
Come on.

254
00:27:19,087 --> 00:27:21,078
We have to go far.

255
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:24,280
Go home.

256
00:27:24,459 --> 00:27:26,154
Like Dad said.

257
00:28:55,216 --> 00:28:57,184
We started here...

258
00:28:57,351 --> 00:28:58,875
...and went up here.

259
00:29:00,388 --> 00:29:01,912
That must be the Salt Pans.

260
00:29:06,727 --> 00:29:07,989
So...

261
00:29:08,963 --> 00:29:11,295
...we've got a lot of map to go.

262
00:29:12,733 --> 00:29:14,860
Should we keep going?.

263
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,336
Yeah, that's what I think too.

264
00:30:31,379 --> 00:30:34,041
It had to happen sooner or later.

265
00:30:38,152 --> 00:30:39,983
But I was hoping for later.

266
00:32:02,668 --> 00:32:05,364
Do you even know what "wild" means?.

267
00:32:05,538 --> 00:32:07,472
Yeah, I thought so.

268
00:34:38,457 --> 00:34:40,015
Hey.

269
00:34:40,292 --> 00:34:41,725
What do you think you're doing?.

270
00:34:42,628 --> 00:34:44,528
What are you doing?.

271
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,061
Do you hear me?.

272
00:35:02,281 --> 00:35:03,646
I am going south.

273
00:35:03,816 --> 00:35:05,681
Do you have a problem with that?.

274
00:35:06,585 --> 00:35:07,984
Yeah.

275
00:35:09,088 --> 00:35:10,453
We're going west.

276
00:35:11,156 --> 00:35:12,623
"We're"?.

277
00:35:12,958 --> 00:35:14,186
You and who else?.

278
00:35:16,228 --> 00:35:18,287
My buddy and l.

279
00:35:38,584 --> 00:35:40,108
Do you have any water?.

280
00:35:41,286 --> 00:35:42,685
Maybe.

281
00:35:44,623 --> 00:35:46,250
What do you got?.

282
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:48,551
The motorcycle.

283
00:35:50,062 --> 00:35:52,360
I could give you a ride.

284
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:56,494
You are thirsty, yeah?.

285
00:36:37,376 --> 00:36:38,843
Hey, hey.

286
00:36:39,978 --> 00:36:42,674
I did not say you could give some
to your animal.

287
00:36:43,282 --> 00:36:45,216
There is not enough.

288
00:36:47,986 --> 00:36:49,476
Does this thing work?.

289
00:36:49,655 --> 00:36:51,145
If you have gas.

290
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:00,022
Opuno Kjadi Ripkuna.

291
00:37:00,799 --> 00:37:02,027
You?.

292
00:37:02,201 --> 00:37:04,032
Xan. Thanks for the water.

293
00:37:05,504 --> 00:37:08,837
A bush baby. How did it get here?.

294
00:37:09,007 --> 00:37:10,634
Same as me.

295
00:37:10,809 --> 00:37:13,004
Too many wrong turns.

296
00:37:15,581 --> 00:37:17,515
Mashaka.

297
00:37:17,683 --> 00:37:20,277
Troublemaker.

298
00:37:22,688 --> 00:37:25,179
Do you know there's a big river?.

299
00:37:25,958 --> 00:37:29,655
It's maybe five days' walk from here.

300
00:37:30,929 --> 00:37:33,727
But to get there we must have food.

301
00:37:35,834 --> 00:37:37,631
So which one?.

302
00:37:39,071 --> 00:37:41,232
So which one what?.

303
00:37:41,807 --> 00:37:44,105
Which one we eat first?.

304
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:47,306
You understand, for us to live...

305
00:37:48,013 --> 00:37:49,947
...we must eat them.

306
00:37:54,686 --> 00:37:56,415
Don't worry.

307
00:37:57,422 --> 00:38:01,324
We have a few days before
we have to make our decision.

308
00:38:42,067 --> 00:38:43,295
Explain to me this idea.

309
00:38:43,468 --> 00:38:45,129
Get more wood.

310
00:38:45,304 --> 00:38:48,068
You know, I don't like your cat
looking at me like this.

311
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,707
Where did you learn this, boy?.

312
00:38:49,875 --> 00:38:51,775
Where did you learn these ideas?.

313
00:38:51,944 --> 00:38:54,037
-My dad taught me.
-Your dad?.

314
00:38:54,212 --> 00:38:56,203
Wait for me, man.

315
00:38:56,381 --> 00:38:59,077
Show me the plan--
What you are going to make, man?.

316
00:39:01,019 --> 00:39:02,577
-Put it up.
-I am.

317
00:39:03,055 --> 00:39:06,149
-Holy smoker.
-Come on, hang on. Quickly.

318
00:39:16,535 --> 00:39:19,231
-Let her go.
-We are doing it, Xan. We are doing it.

319
00:39:19,404 --> 00:39:20,996
Hang on.

320
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:26,507
Holy smoke.

321
00:39:29,781 --> 00:39:32,011
Xan, look.

322
00:39:32,718 --> 00:39:34,015
Say goodbye, Xan.

323
00:39:34,186 --> 00:39:36,746
Bye-bye, plane.

324
00:39:37,389 --> 00:39:41,257
-Hello, river.
-To the right. To the right.

325
00:40:01,046 --> 00:40:04,743
Oh, Xan. We are going to live.

326
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:24,796
-We need water.
-Don't worry.

327
00:40:25,237 --> 00:40:27,000
We find it.

328
00:41:24,062 --> 00:41:26,053
I told you so.

329
00:41:36,274 --> 00:41:38,674
This is your big chance, boy.

330
00:41:41,746 --> 00:41:43,611
Remember what Dad said?.

331
00:41:43,782 --> 00:41:45,579
Chase, trip, bite.

332
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,479
You can do this.

333
00:41:48,587 --> 00:41:50,214
Come.

334
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:53,981
Duma. Duma.

335
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:55,820
Come, boy.

336
00:41:59,764 --> 00:42:01,288
Come.

337
00:42:03,335 --> 00:42:05,132
Go get him.

338
00:42:26,024 --> 00:42:29,187
Yeah, yeah.
Your cheetah is a great hunter.

339
00:42:29,361 --> 00:42:31,386
I'm very impressed. He caught an egg.

340
00:42:38,904 --> 00:42:40,963
You know, your cheetah...

341
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,838
...he will not live long out there.

342
00:42:45,577 --> 00:42:48,512
For what he would be worth,
you know you could build a house.

343
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:51,078
You could build a lot of houses.

344
00:42:51,316 --> 00:42:53,841
Maybe even buy a nice car.

345
00:42:54,152 --> 00:42:55,483
With DVD.

346
00:42:58,957 --> 00:43:01,152
You don't sell a friend.

347
00:43:02,661 --> 00:43:04,253
You know, the rich...

348
00:43:04,429 --> 00:43:06,454
...they buy animal like him every day.

349
00:43:06,631 --> 00:43:09,293
Pay big money, make business.

350
00:43:09,467 --> 00:43:12,834
You know?. Zoo, fun park.

351
00:43:13,238 --> 00:43:15,934
And then they make more money.

352
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:22,512
Where are you going, boy?.
Do you know where you are going?.

353
00:43:26,351 --> 00:43:29,252
My dad and I found him over here.

354
00:43:29,955 --> 00:43:32,515
So you plan to cross the Okavango.

355
00:43:32,691 --> 00:43:34,488
Yeah, so?.

356
00:43:35,327 --> 00:43:37,158
"Yeah, so?. "

357
00:43:37,996 --> 00:43:42,365
That is a place of many teeth, my friend.
It is a place to die.

358
00:43:43,568 --> 00:43:45,661
I'm not afraid.

359
00:43:46,571 --> 00:43:48,505
Be smart.

360
00:43:49,975 --> 00:43:51,704
Be afraid.

361
00:43:57,549 --> 00:43:59,380
"l am not afraid."

362
00:43:59,551 --> 00:44:01,610
Stupid boy.

363
00:44:01,786 --> 00:44:03,276
Don't know nothing.

364
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:04,888
Don't know nothing.

365
00:44:26,378 --> 00:44:29,814
You know, you could end up
in a lion's belly.

366
00:44:32,484 --> 00:44:34,008
Fire.

367
00:44:34,586 --> 00:44:38,044
Fire is the only thing that scares them.

368
00:44:46,364 --> 00:44:48,730
You know, I know that place.

369
00:44:49,367 --> 00:44:52,359
I could take you a little way that way.

370
00:44:52,804 --> 00:44:55,671
But then I have to go back south, eh?.

371
00:44:56,775 --> 00:44:58,367
You would like that?.

372
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,409
Okay.

373
00:45:06,418 --> 00:45:09,615
I won't take you all the whole way.
Just some of the way.

374
00:45:24,569 --> 00:45:26,366
Come on, boy.

375
00:46:26,364 --> 00:46:28,093
Who are they?.

376
00:46:28,266 --> 00:46:29,858
People.

377
00:46:30,201 --> 00:46:33,193
People who never dreamed
that they would die here.

378
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:42,746
This place is full of angry spirits, eh?.

379
00:46:56,528 --> 00:46:58,962
There's a story in this.

380
00:47:04,669 --> 00:47:07,467
I'm not sure I want to know it, eh?.

381
00:47:07,872 --> 00:47:09,897
You know, in the right hands...

382
00:47:10,308 --> 00:47:12,105
...this will kill anything.

383
00:47:26,224 --> 00:47:27,452
Hey.

384
00:47:27,625 --> 00:47:30,093
Come here. Come.

385
00:47:31,629 --> 00:47:33,995
-Hide now.
-Why?.

386
00:47:34,199 --> 00:47:35,632
-Who is it?.
-Bad people.

387
00:47:37,802 --> 00:47:39,269
In here.

388
00:47:39,604 --> 00:47:40,935
Come on, Duma.

389
00:47:56,287 --> 00:47:57,777
We need to go farther.

390
00:47:57,956 --> 00:48:01,153
There's nothing here but sand.
I can't see anything.

391
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,365
Come here.

392
00:48:10,535 --> 00:48:12,230
Get down.

393
00:48:45,737 --> 00:48:47,568
Do you know...

394
00:48:48,773 --> 00:48:51,970
...how he got those black lines
on his face?.

395
00:48:56,881 --> 00:49:01,318
They say it's to stop the glare from
the sun during the day while they hunt.

396
00:49:01,486 --> 00:49:03,647
There was a mother cheetah.

397
00:49:04,188 --> 00:49:07,817
She loved her cub very much,
and one day...

398
00:49:08,393 --> 00:49:10,088
...he got lost.

399
00:49:10,728 --> 00:49:15,222
And she searched, and she searched.
And she called, and she called.

400
00:49:16,134 --> 00:49:19,069
And she cried so long and so hard...

401
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:22,439
...that her tears made black streaks...

402
00:49:22,774 --> 00:49:24,639
...down her face.

403
00:49:29,314 --> 00:49:31,248
Her face...

404
00:49:31,983 --> 00:49:34,110
...was stained forever...

405
00:49:34,485 --> 00:49:36,510
...from her crying.

406
00:50:00,311 --> 00:50:02,438
An honorable weapon...

407
00:50:03,081 --> 00:50:05,276
...if there is such a thing.

408
00:50:06,484 --> 00:50:08,679
For a real warrior, you know.

409
00:50:08,853 --> 00:50:14,086
For you to face your enemies
and show your courage...

410
00:50:15,893 --> 00:50:17,690
...eye to eye.

411
00:50:31,809 --> 00:50:34,334
A lot of diamonds came out of here.

412
00:50:34,512 --> 00:50:36,673
I know they did not get them all.

413
00:50:38,216 --> 00:50:40,150
Always I look.

414
00:50:40,318 --> 00:50:42,616
One day, I'll get lucky.

415
00:50:42,787 --> 00:50:44,015
Make rich.

416
00:50:44,188 --> 00:50:46,315
You. Stay.

417
00:50:46,824 --> 00:50:48,291
I want to keep going.

418
00:50:48,459 --> 00:50:51,622
Just one quick look. I'm coming, man.

419
00:50:57,835 --> 00:50:59,063
Oh, it's an old one.

420
00:51:00,438 --> 00:51:03,339
Lots of smelly old ghosts in here.

421
00:51:09,514 --> 00:51:10,913
Now's our chance.

422
00:51:11,082 --> 00:51:12,310
Let's go.

423
00:51:12,483 --> 00:51:13,950
Come, boy.

424
00:51:24,595 --> 00:51:26,153
Rip.

425
00:51:28,399 --> 00:51:30,162
Rip!

426
00:51:30,368 --> 00:51:31,926
Rip!

427
00:51:36,274 --> 00:51:37,969
Rip!

428
00:51:39,043 --> 00:51:41,603
I'm here. Hang on.

429
00:51:54,192 --> 00:51:56,057
I'm trying, Rip.

430
00:51:59,497 --> 00:52:02,398
Xan. Thank God for you, Xan.

431
00:52:02,834 --> 00:52:04,062
Thank God for you.

432
00:52:08,372 --> 00:52:10,465
Grace, we are lucky.

433
00:52:10,675 --> 00:52:15,009
This little stuff. No big stuff.
Dig, boy. Dig.

434
00:52:21,219 --> 00:52:23,187
Why you are stopping?.

435
00:52:25,056 --> 00:52:27,422
Where have you been taking us?.

436
00:52:28,226 --> 00:52:31,161
-I'm taking you where you want to go.
-No, you're not.

437
00:52:31,963 --> 00:52:33,692
You're taking us north, not west.

438
00:52:33,865 --> 00:52:36,493
I am taking you the way
to the mountains.

439
00:52:36,667 --> 00:52:41,070
-It's the way to town. To the police, and--
-What are you talking about?.

440
00:52:41,239 --> 00:52:43,730
Collecting a reward for me
and selling Duma.

441
00:52:44,275 --> 00:52:46,368
How do you get such ideas?.

442
00:52:46,544 --> 00:52:48,409
I am taking you north to go west.

443
00:52:48,579 --> 00:52:52,037
-lf you go straight west, it is a way to--
-You're just trying to scare me.

444
00:52:52,216 --> 00:52:55,652
You want me to go your way
so you can turn us in.

445
00:52:57,155 --> 00:52:59,214
-Xan.
-You go your way, and I'll go mine.

446
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:02,848
Xan, where you are going?. Xan.

447
00:53:03,027 --> 00:53:05,188
Come back.
You can't leave me like this, Xan.

448
00:53:08,199 --> 00:53:11,293
Xan. Come back, Xan.

449
00:53:12,503 --> 00:53:13,834
Xan.

450
00:53:14,005 --> 00:53:15,233
Xan!

451
00:53:15,406 --> 00:53:17,169
Xan, come back!

452
00:53:17,942 --> 00:53:20,672
-I don't want him to follow us.
-Xan, come back.

453
00:53:20,878 --> 00:53:23,278
You can't leave me in here, Xan.

454
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:02,483
We're gonna have to cross
the river tomorrow.

455
00:54:03,821 --> 00:54:06,415
We're better off without him.

456
00:55:11,522 --> 00:55:12,887
Come on, Duma.

457
00:55:16,494 --> 00:55:18,758
You're not gonna get wet.

458
00:55:22,199 --> 00:55:23,962
Quickly.

459
00:55:24,435 --> 00:55:27,495
Fine, you stay there. We're going.

460
00:56:20,324 --> 00:56:22,053
Hang on.

461
00:57:01,432 --> 00:57:03,161
Duma!

462
00:57:51,816 --> 00:57:53,716
Duma, Duma. Quickly. Come out.

463
00:57:56,053 --> 00:57:58,112
Come on, Duma.

464
00:58:12,570 --> 00:58:14,731
Two fast cats, eh?.

465
00:58:21,745 --> 00:58:24,578
Mashaka. Come here, boy.

466
00:58:42,133 --> 00:58:45,227
High chance of thunderstorms
due to a low-pressure system...

467
00:58:45,402 --> 00:58:47,632
...moving into the country
from the coastal area.

468
00:58:47,805 --> 00:58:49,272
Back.

469
00:59:26,177 --> 00:59:27,576
Hey.

470
00:59:38,255 --> 00:59:39,483
Come on, run.

471
00:59:54,872 --> 00:59:56,703
Duma, no.

472
00:59:57,174 --> 00:59:58,607
Duma, wait.

473
00:59:58,876 --> 01:00:00,571
Oh, man.

474
01:01:32,236 --> 01:01:33,760
Duma?.

475
01:01:49,586 --> 01:01:51,577
Duma.

476
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:08,562
Duma?.

477
01:03:14,705 --> 01:03:17,173
Well, Mashaka.

478
01:04:10,661 --> 01:04:12,253
What happened?.

479
01:04:13,730 --> 01:04:16,130
You found Duma.

480
01:04:16,567 --> 01:04:17,829
Yes.

481
01:04:18,001 --> 01:04:19,935
He was in a poacher's trap.

482
01:04:20,103 --> 01:04:22,571
You were in a hog's house.

483
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:26,571
That is better than being
in a lion's belly, no?.

484
01:04:37,955 --> 01:04:40,446
I'm sorry for what I did.

485
01:04:41,492 --> 01:04:43,619
It was a mistake.

486
01:04:43,994 --> 01:04:45,985
But you were right.

487
01:04:47,164 --> 01:04:51,066
I was thinking about how much money
I could get for you both.

488
01:05:06,850 --> 01:05:09,512
I had big plans, Xan.

489
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:12,685
I left my village, my wife, my children...

490
01:05:12,856 --> 01:05:14,448
...to be a big man.

491
01:05:14,625 --> 01:05:17,890
Went to the big city to make big money.

492
01:05:18,829 --> 01:05:21,127
But I did not find work, eh?.

493
01:05:21,298 --> 01:05:24,825
And soon, I was a small man
that did small things.

494
01:05:25,469 --> 01:05:28,404
I ended up in the biggest jail
you ever see.

495
01:05:28,872 --> 01:05:32,308
That is a place I never want to
go to again. Do you understand?.

496
01:05:39,182 --> 01:05:41,878
My mother probably hates me.

497
01:05:42,853 --> 01:05:44,718
Because I left her.

498
01:05:47,558 --> 01:05:50,686
Mothers never stop loving their children.

499
01:05:53,864 --> 01:05:56,594
What do you know about mothers?.

500
01:06:00,404 --> 01:06:02,429
I am a father.

501
01:06:19,489 --> 01:06:21,480
This is dinner.

502
01:06:26,997 --> 01:06:29,090
This way, this way.

503
01:06:30,434 --> 01:06:33,335
Quickly, come. He's got him.

504
01:06:56,593 --> 01:06:58,686
We are not going to eat tonight.

505
01:07:21,785 --> 01:07:24,151
Now, that food...

506
01:07:24,321 --> 01:07:26,289
...that will be an easy catch.

507
01:07:27,391 --> 01:07:28,653
Maybe.

508
01:07:28,825 --> 01:07:30,520
You have any ideas?.

509
01:07:30,694 --> 01:07:32,161
Yeah.

510
01:07:35,632 --> 01:07:38,396
-Only blue one I've seen.
-You look, and I'll focus.

511
01:07:38,702 --> 01:07:40,192
A green-breasted fluffy tail.

512
01:07:41,004 --> 01:07:43,598
No, I think it's fluffy-breasted, isn't it?.

513
01:07:44,975 --> 01:07:47,739
-You're wrong. Quite wrong.
-And now. What do I do now?.

514
01:07:48,645 --> 01:07:49,976
You're quite wrong.

515
01:07:50,147 --> 01:07:52,240
I think it's an African red-eyed bulbul.

516
01:07:52,416 --> 01:07:54,680
You are ready?.

517
01:07:54,851 --> 01:07:56,478
Yeah.

518
01:08:00,424 --> 01:08:02,858
No, no, you're quite wrong.

519
01:08:03,026 --> 01:08:05,119
No, I'm talking about the--

520
01:08:05,295 --> 01:08:07,559
That's a water bird, darling.

521
01:08:07,731 --> 01:08:10,256
Well, I don't see anything there at all.

522
01:08:10,434 --> 01:08:12,595
-Are your contacts in?.
-They're in.

523
01:08:12,769 --> 01:08:14,600
Help me.

524
01:08:14,771 --> 01:08:16,864
It bit me.

525
01:08:20,544 --> 01:08:23,035
-lt bit me.
-What bit you?.

526
01:08:23,213 --> 01:08:25,704
-What bit you?.
-This.

527
01:08:27,617 --> 01:08:29,209
It's a black mamba!

528
01:08:39,496 --> 01:08:41,691
That's right, lad.

529
01:08:41,865 --> 01:08:43,457
Eat.

530
01:08:55,145 --> 01:08:57,204
You will go far, Xan.

531
01:08:57,380 --> 01:08:59,814
As long as you stay out of jail, eh?.

532
01:09:05,021 --> 01:09:07,182
I want you to have this.

533
01:09:07,924 --> 01:09:09,585
What is that?.

534
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:12,058
It's for helping me.

535
01:09:13,330 --> 01:09:15,321
No. I can't.

536
01:09:15,966 --> 01:09:17,957
I want you to have it.

537
01:09:18,135 --> 01:09:20,603
I don't want it.
You don't understand, Xan.

538
01:09:20,771 --> 01:09:23,296
People die for that stuff.

539
01:09:23,473 --> 01:09:24,963
I can't take it.

540
01:09:25,142 --> 01:09:27,667
Okay.

541
01:09:27,844 --> 01:09:29,744
Then the water has it.

542
01:09:29,913 --> 01:09:34,543
Five, four, three, two, one--

543
01:09:34,718 --> 01:09:36,618
Okay, okay, okay.

544
01:09:38,188 --> 01:09:41,624
I am sure I'm going to help you
at least one more time, eh?.

545
01:09:42,726 --> 01:09:44,785
I will safe-keep it.

546
01:09:44,961 --> 01:09:46,724
Come.

547
01:09:46,897 --> 01:09:48,489
Look.

548
01:09:48,665 --> 01:09:50,292
You see this?.

549
01:09:51,968 --> 01:09:54,766
These pretty little stones...

550
01:09:54,938 --> 01:09:58,635
...I found when I had to dig myself out.

551
01:09:59,109 --> 01:10:00,974
Do you remember?.

552
01:10:02,345 --> 01:10:03,812
It's okay.

553
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:05,208
Take them.

554
01:10:05,382 --> 01:10:09,284
I want you to remember
your friend Ripkuna.

555
01:10:12,489 --> 01:10:14,150
I'll remember you, Rip.

556
01:10:14,324 --> 01:10:15,848
But I hope you remember me.

557
01:10:16,493 --> 01:10:19,951
Because now I'm gonna say goodbye.

558
01:10:23,567 --> 01:10:25,000
Xan?.

559
01:10:26,937 --> 01:10:29,167
Xan. What you are do--?.

560
01:10:29,339 --> 01:10:30,567
Wake up, Xan.

561
01:10:33,143 --> 01:10:36,601
Xan. Don't do that. That was not funny.

562
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:39,908
I'll kill you myself next time.
Stupid boy with no ass. Get on.

563
01:10:40,083 --> 01:10:41,948
You wish.

564
01:11:15,619 --> 01:11:18,087
What is that noise you are making?.

565
01:11:18,255 --> 01:11:21,383
When two cheetahs are lost,
and they're looking for each other...

566
01:11:21,558 --> 01:11:23,025
...they make that sound.

567
01:11:37,974 --> 01:11:39,532
Hey.

568
01:11:39,709 --> 01:11:43,372
Lions. Not so long ago.

569
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:06,728
Come on, Duma. You're being selfish.

570
01:12:10,106 --> 01:12:12,540
Leave him.

571
01:12:12,709 --> 01:12:16,702
Remember, it's what you wanted.

572
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:19,678
That meat is in his bones from way back.

573
01:12:26,056 --> 01:12:27,956
It's all right.

574
01:13:29,719 --> 01:13:33,314
My grandfather would bring me to this place
when I was younger than you.

575
01:13:36,659 --> 01:13:38,991
The old ones...

576
01:13:39,162 --> 01:13:40,925
...they talk to me.

577
01:13:41,831 --> 01:13:44,561
See how they lived, feared...

578
01:13:44,734 --> 01:13:46,201
...who they loved.

579
01:13:47,837 --> 01:13:50,237
Their world is gone.

580
01:13:50,740 --> 01:13:52,901
But we are not so different.

581
01:13:59,449 --> 01:14:02,577
You know, nobody comes here anymore.

582
01:14:05,655 --> 01:14:07,850
They are all forgotten.

583
01:14:12,695 --> 01:14:17,530
I myself am no better. My own father,
I do not know whether he lives or not.

584
01:14:23,873 --> 01:14:25,738
My father...

585
01:14:27,410 --> 01:14:29,776
...he died recently.

586
01:14:32,949 --> 01:14:37,147
How can someone
just disappear like that...

587
01:14:37,754 --> 01:14:39,517
...forever?.

588
01:14:46,563 --> 01:14:49,054
Yebo...

589
01:14:49,232 --> 01:14:50,563
...I, too, would be angry.

590
01:14:54,170 --> 01:14:55,933
You know, Xan...

591
01:14:56,606 --> 01:14:59,336
...people go when they are ready to go.

592
01:14:59,509 --> 01:15:01,477
Not when you are.

593
01:15:02,779 --> 01:15:04,713
We are all just...

594
01:15:06,282 --> 01:15:08,807
...travelers on the same river.

595
01:15:09,819 --> 01:15:13,016
Grandparents, parents,
their sons and daughters.

596
01:15:14,824 --> 01:15:17,918
We all have our time on the river.
We just....

597
01:15:20,096 --> 01:15:22,894
We do what we can before we disappear.

598
01:15:25,668 --> 01:15:27,898
This is your time, Xan.

599
01:15:28,671 --> 01:15:30,332
Duma's.

600
01:15:31,107 --> 01:15:32,665
And mine.

601
01:15:36,779 --> 01:15:38,644
Very soon we will be
where Duma is going.

602
01:15:38,815 --> 01:15:40,339
After...

603
01:15:41,985 --> 01:15:44,351
...I am going to go and see my family.

604
01:15:44,521 --> 01:15:46,921
See if they welcome me or not.

605
01:15:47,957 --> 01:15:50,551
And you can go and see your mother.

606
01:15:53,329 --> 01:15:55,820
Your father is dead for her too.

607
01:15:58,801 --> 01:16:01,201
Everything's changed.

608
01:16:01,371 --> 01:16:02,998
It's not the same.

609
01:16:03,173 --> 01:16:04,902
-It's different.
-That's it, Xan.

610
01:16:07,310 --> 01:16:09,471
Change, yeah.

611
01:16:09,646 --> 01:16:11,307
That's what happens.

612
01:16:11,481 --> 01:16:13,278
All the time.

613
01:16:15,818 --> 01:16:18,582
The little boy that left home...

614
01:16:18,755 --> 01:16:21,747
...is not the little boy
that is with me now, eh?.

615
01:16:23,993 --> 01:16:25,392
See?.

616
01:16:29,599 --> 01:16:31,157
Change.

617
01:16:48,818 --> 01:16:50,080
Xan, can you see?.

618
01:16:50,253 --> 01:16:53,518
-Above that cliff, in the canyon.
-Yeah.

619
01:16:53,690 --> 01:16:56,989
A village. My village.

620
01:17:00,897 --> 01:17:03,092
Xan, stop.

621
01:17:04,601 --> 01:17:07,092
-What is it?.
-Tsetse.

622
01:17:08,504 --> 01:17:10,028
Do what I say, yeah?.

623
01:17:10,506 --> 01:17:12,167
You have to run.

624
01:17:22,352 --> 01:17:24,411
Hey. Wait. Wait!

625
01:17:27,357 --> 01:17:28,949
Now, breathe.

626
01:17:29,259 --> 01:17:31,159
Keep breathing.

627
01:18:07,697 --> 01:18:09,665
Rip, what is wrong?.

628
01:18:10,867 --> 01:18:14,963
I'm sorry, Xan.
Long time ago, got very sick from tsetse.

629
01:18:15,138 --> 01:18:16,435
Was bad.

630
01:18:16,606 --> 01:18:18,301
Real bad.

631
01:18:20,443 --> 01:18:21,705
We hurry now.

632
01:18:56,245 --> 01:19:00,204
Fire. We have to build a fire.

633
01:19:05,822 --> 01:19:08,290
They see us. They are coming down now.

634
01:19:08,458 --> 01:19:10,016
Yeah, yeah.

635
01:19:14,864 --> 01:19:18,163
-It's going. Up a bit.
-Yes.

636
01:19:22,071 --> 01:19:24,039
It's too wet.

637
01:19:27,143 --> 01:19:28,405
Hold it up.

638
01:19:28,578 --> 01:19:31,843
I can't hold it. My hands don't work.

639
01:19:32,315 --> 01:19:34,806
Look. That is it.

640
01:19:36,185 --> 01:19:38,210
See, they are still dry.

641
01:19:39,922 --> 01:19:42,117
Easy come, easy go. Take it.

642
01:19:42,859 --> 01:19:44,190
Burn it.

643
01:19:51,634 --> 01:19:53,693
Yes, yes.

644
01:19:54,871 --> 01:19:56,600
Very good.

645
01:20:25,067 --> 01:20:27,433
Duma, you have to stay here.

646
01:20:39,949 --> 01:20:41,280
Rip.

647
01:20:41,451 --> 01:20:44,386
Hang on. I'm gonna get help.

648
01:22:09,038 --> 01:22:10,665
Hello?.

649
01:22:11,140 --> 01:22:13,199
Is anybody here?.

650
01:22:19,582 --> 01:22:21,709
My friend is sick. I need your help.

651
01:23:47,436 --> 01:23:49,165
Duma.

652
01:25:01,811 --> 01:25:03,574
Duma.

653
01:26:14,416 --> 01:26:16,850
Rip. Ripkuna.

654
01:26:18,087 --> 01:26:19,679
Ripkuna.

655
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:53,220
Otorno.

656
01:26:55,724 --> 01:26:57,715
Otorno.

657
01:27:01,230 --> 01:27:02,993
Ainu.

658
01:27:03,165 --> 01:27:05,156
Ainu.

659
01:27:33,495 --> 01:27:35,486
I'm sorry.

660
01:27:42,805 --> 01:27:44,568
I'm sorry.

661
01:27:49,311 --> 01:27:50,801
Xan.

662
01:27:51,814 --> 01:27:54,146
I want you to meet my family.

663
01:27:56,685 --> 01:27:58,175
This is Ainu.

664
01:27:59,688 --> 01:28:02,350
Otorno, my son.

665
01:28:03,192 --> 01:28:05,353
Melika, my wife.

666
01:28:10,132 --> 01:28:13,966
I said we have been
on a long journey together.

667
01:28:14,136 --> 01:28:17,572
That you are a mad-cat boy.

668
01:28:17,740 --> 01:28:21,767
That we are family. All of us together.

669
01:28:53,042 --> 01:28:55,067
Duma.

670
01:30:09,151 --> 01:30:10,982
Duma.

671
01:30:49,925 --> 01:30:52,291
He's a wild animal. Remember?

672
01:30:55,597 --> 01:30:56,928
His wildness is something...

673
01:30:57,099 --> 01:30:58,896
...he knows without even knowing it.

674
01:30:59,068 --> 01:31:02,162
It's in his blood, his bones.

675
01:31:02,604 --> 01:31:05,437
Like a memory, yeah?

676
01:31:09,078 --> 01:31:11,308
You and I will take him up next week.

677
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:15,348
Okay? Camp out, do a bit of fishing.

678
01:31:15,517 --> 01:31:18,486
It'll be lekker, man, send him off.

679
01:31:45,414 --> 01:31:46,642
Hey, you.

680
01:31:46,815 --> 01:31:49,545
You got it, boy.

681
01:31:49,718 --> 01:31:52,186
Found a buddy and everything.

682
01:32:07,002 --> 01:32:09,300
You take care of yourself.

683
01:32:10,672 --> 01:32:12,537
I'm gonna miss you.

684
01:34:26,642 --> 01:34:30,100
There are things you know
without knowing.

685
01:34:30,279 --> 01:34:32,509
For Duma, it was his wildness.

686
01:34:32,781 --> 01:34:35,272
For Rip, his family.

687
01:34:35,450 --> 01:34:38,180
For me, it was my dad.

688
01:34:39,855 --> 01:34:43,222
Everything he was,
everything he believed in...

689
01:34:43,392 --> 01:34:45,587
...is now part of me.

690
01:34:51,433 --> 01:34:56,530
I was taking Duma home,
but he took me somewhere too.

691
01:34:59,675 --> 01:35:03,304
Finding Duma 's true home
brought me back to mine...

692
01:35:03,478 --> 01:35:07,574
...and showed me that love doesn 't stop
when time passes...

693
01:35:07,749 --> 01:35:12,618
...or you live in different places,
or somebody's gone.

694
01:35:12,788 --> 01:35:16,019
That's how it was with me and Duma.

695
01:40:33,441 --> 01:40:35,432
