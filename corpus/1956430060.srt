00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,000
( women sobbing )

3
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,750
REPORTER:
Congressman Adam Clayton Powell,

4
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,250
Harlem's controversial
preacher politician,

5
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:15,260
was laid to rest today after
a well-attended ceremony

6
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,770
at his own Abyssinian
Baptist Church.

7
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,260
As chairman of the Education
and Labor Committee,

8
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,260
Congressman Powell,
a charismatic,

9
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,270
self-styled activist,

10
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:25,770
became the most powerful
black elected official

11
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,780
in United States history.

12
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,270
He was 63 years old.

13
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,770
( church bell tolls )

14
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,280
SCHILLER:
I never finished the story
while Powell was alive

15
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,790
because it was too easy
to get wrong.

16
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,780
The man was complex.

17
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:43,280
Now that he was dead, I sure as
hell didn't want to mess it up.

18
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,790
His enemies would love it.

19
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,780
Mr. Speaker.

20
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,770
SPEAKER McCORMACK:
For what purpose

21
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,780
does the gentleman
from California rise?

22
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,790
Mr. Speaker, it is
upon my responsibility

23
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,780
as a Member Elect
of the 90th Congress

24
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,780
that I make a motion that
the gentleman from New York,

25
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,800
Mr. Powell,
not be sworn in at this time

26
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,290
as a member of this Congress.

27
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,040
Does the gentleman demand

28
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:11,550
that the gentleman from
New York step aside?

29
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,540
Yes, Mr. Speaker,
and I further move

30
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,530
that a special bipartisan
committee be appointed

31
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:23,050
to determine ultimately how
Mr. Powell should be dealt with.

32
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,040
This committee should report
its findings back

33
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:30,560
within five weeks in order
that we, at that time, can, uh,

34
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,880
find a more permanent solution
to the Powell matter.

35
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,890
SCHILLER:
Adam, Adam, Adam.

36
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,390
We both know a measly little
newspaper article--

37
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,400
even if it is the front page--

38
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,750
doesn't come close, man.

39
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,750
Impossible, but I had to try.

40
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,650
Adam Clayton Powell Jr.,
of New York,

41
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,140
is excluded from his seat
in this house...

42
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,150
( light applause )

43
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,150
...until such time as the
bipartisan subcommittee

44
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,650
delivers its report.

45
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,620
( gavel pounding )

46
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,130
The sons of bitches.

47
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,620
They really did it.

48
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:16,570
Congress threw away
the Constitution

49
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,970
to railroad
Adam Clayton Powell today.

50
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,220
I had too much power
for a Negro.

51
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,730
( reporters clamoring )

52
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,220
First they stole away

53
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,970
the Education and Labor
Committee Chairmanship

54
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,470
I worked fair and hard to get,

55
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,480
and gave it to Carl Perkins
of Kentucky.

56
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,350
Then, to underline
their contempt for me

57
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,860
and the people
who voted me into Congress,

58
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,350
they kicked me out
of Congress itself.

59
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:43,850
With this whole thing, we're
going to say it just like it is.

60
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,000
Any Congressman
with a conscience

61
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,590
won't be sleeping well tonight.

62
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,090
( congregation laughs )

63
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,610
They say it's a question
of character and ethics.

64
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,100
They say your congressman,

65
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,100
your pastor, lacks in both.

66
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,570
MAN:
That's not true!

67
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,820
That's what my distinguished
colleagues say about me.

68
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,780
They say it's my absenteeism,

69
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,270
relatives on the payroll

70
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,260
and the way that I flaunt
the use of public funds

71
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:11,770
to travel first-class,
some of it for pleasure.

72
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,780
Of course I have pleasure
when I travel.

73
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,620
And of course I travel
first class, baby. They do.

74
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:25,850
My esteemed colleagues say
I gall the American people.

75
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:26,850
Do I gall y'all?

76
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,810
MAN:
No.

77
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,420
That I gall the people.

78
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,630
That's like the sheet
calling the pillowcase white.

79
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,100
Amen!

80
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:38,100
The people,
not Congress, decides

81
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:41,030
who represents them.

82
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,510
Nowhere in the Constitution
that I read

83
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,030
does it stipulate that
the House of Representatives

84
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:51,020
has the right to dictate who
represents the people of Harlem.

85
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,000
Why, if it was up
to those hypocrites

86
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:56,020
I never would have been elected
in the first place.

87
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,010
Well, they would have
excluded me long ago

88
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,010
when I first introduced
the Powell Amendment.

89
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,000
They would have excluded me

90
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,990
for holding their feet
to the fire

91
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:09,500
to provide the type of
leadership and representation

92
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,490
provided for us
in the great document

93
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,000
the Constitution of
the United States of America.

94
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,830
What sort of leadership
do we have in this country

95
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,060
when there are people who have
fought and died for this country

96
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,550
that there are still places
that we can't go

97
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,540
and sit down
and order a cup of coffee

98
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,390
in a cheap little
lunch counter?!

99
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:37,230
If these men, our leaders, can't
lead us to a better nation,

100
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,240
can't themselves provide
the type of democracy

101
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,250
that they are preaching,

102
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,740
then all of them,
each and every one,

103
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,240
should just sit down
and shut up!

104
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,520
WOMAN:
Congressman,
you can't just go...

105
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,020
I want my seat back, baby.

106
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,010
MCCORMACK:
Adam, we-we were
just discussing you.

107
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,010
Please join us.

108
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,010
MAN:
Congressman.

109
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,520
MCCORMICK:
Uh, Manny Cellar here is
chairman of the committee

110
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,010
to evaluate the
charges against you.

111
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,980
John Conyers, a friend.

112
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,980
He'll be on it.

113
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,480
I was elected
by the people of Harlem

114
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,480
to be their representative
in Congress.

115
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,990
I fit all the criteria
in the Constitution

116
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,490
to be their congressman.

117
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,000
My colleagues can't
just kick me out

118
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,990
because they don't like
the truth I speak

119
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:18,490
or the way I speak it.

120
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,000
You're not being
kicked out, Adam.

121
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:26,100
You're being temporarily
excluded, pending the findings

122
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,080
of the investigation.

123
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,590
Don't patronize me,
Mr. McCormack.

124
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,590
I want my seat back.

125
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,600
I'm right.

126
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:36,060
And in the end, I'll be
proven right, I guarantee it.

127
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,560
Good to see another black face
in the Congress

128
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:42,040
Mr. Conyers.

129
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,020
Keep the faith, baby.

130
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:54,470
SCHILLER:
It was, uh, June 8, 1969,
when I landed in Bimini.

131
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,950
Adam went down there so often
they called it Adam's Island.

132
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,950
I had done all my research,

133
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,450
and as a result of which, I had
absolutely no idea

134
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,960
what manner of man
I was going to encounter.

135
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,790
Everybody had
a different story.

136
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,800
The only consistent thing
was that Adam Clayton Powell

137
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,310
was smart, slick and liked
the finer things in life.

138
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,300
Damn.

139
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,810
Congressman Watson
from South Carolina

140
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,820
said Adam Powell lived
down here in paradise

141
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,190
with a drink in one hand
and a woman in the other.

142
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,690
I don't know what they consider
paradise in South Carolina,

143
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,810
but where I come from,
this is a raggedy-ass shack.

144
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,890
And maybe I took the wrong road.

145
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,620
Mr. Powell?

146
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,120
Adam Clayton Powell?

147
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,490
Congressman Powell?

148
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,990
Hello?

149
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,830
( typing )

150
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,850
Door wide open.

151
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,340
Scotch laid out on the table
with three glasses.

152
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,320
I figured Powell
knew I was coming

153
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:17,840
and he wanted me
to feel comfortable...

154
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,330
make myself at home.

155
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,830
So I did.

156
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,830
But I learned, like so many
others, never assume anything

157
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,820
with Adam Clayton Powell Jr.

158
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:32,330
Mister, what are you
doing in my house?

159
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,840
Drinking my liquor?

160
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,330
Reading my books?

161
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:39,310
I'm a reporter,
Congressman Powell.

162
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,830
For The Defender.

163
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,320
Joe Schiller?

164
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,820
We exchanged letters.

165
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,550
Did I tell you
you could take over my house?

166
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:51,040
Having a drink after working
my way through your jungle

167
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,550
trying to find this place

168
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:55,060
hardly constitutes
taking over your house.

169
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,050
But if I offended you

170
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:59,180
I apologize.

171
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,700
You sound pretty damn proper.

172
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:05,190
An educated Negro.

173
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,640
Relax, man.

174
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,660
What did you say
your name was?

175
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,160
Schiller.

176
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,150
Joe Schiller.

177
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:25,640
I hear you're... working
on a book about your colleagues

178
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,590
in Congress.

179
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,610
You mean the textbook
I'm working on?

180
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,100
General information.

181
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,600
I hear it's information about
who's done what and to whom.

182
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:36,600
Sounds like a get-even
book to me.

183
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,590
I'd have to go backward
to get even.

184
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,940
My intentions are merely
to provide insight

185
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,430
to the population on how
their representatives

186
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,430
do the business
of government.

187
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,940
Want to help me clean
these fish, Mr. Schiller?

188
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,440
Not really.

189
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,950
Then you don't get to eat.

190
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,670
You sure you've never
done this before?

191
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,660
Positive.

192
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,260
Would've never known.

193
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,770
If I wasn't starving
from trying to find this place

194
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:03,770
I wouldn't be doing it now.

195
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,780
What kind of story
are you after, Mr. Schiller?

196
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,740
I just want to know
what's true and what isn't.

197
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,240
You know... who you are.

198
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,240
A lot of that
depends on who you are

199
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,730
wouldn't you say?

200
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:18,230
Do you mind if we go back
to your formative years

201
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,730
when you were
an activist?

202
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,740
I still am.

203
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,240
Well, I know that
as a young man, you...

204
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,750
Well, young is relative,
Mr. Schiller.

205
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,740
A state of mind.

206
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,240
Well, when you were
younger in years,

207
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:34,260
you organized protests
and boycotts in New York
to get black folks jobs.

208
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,250
That was more as a
religious leader, right?

209
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,750
There's no separation
of church and state

210
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,760
in the black community,
Mr. Schiller.

211
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,760
You should know that, brother.

212
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,230
Well, then, what caused you

213
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,730
to leave the pulpit
and go into politics?

214
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,700
I never left.

215
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,190
I'm still a pastor
of Abyssinian Baptist Church.

All right, that's it!

223
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,940
Break it down!
I want him out!

224
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,440
I want him out!

225
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,440
Ease up, baby.

226
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:23,450
No need to go breaking
down people's doors, now.

227
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,460
I'm Reverend Adam
Clayton Powell Jr.

228
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,450
I'd like a word in private
with Mr. O'Malley.

229
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,940
Mr. O'Malley?

230
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,940
Unless you got
my money, Powell

231
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,440
we got nothing
to talk about.

232
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:37,950
I got eviction papers here.

233
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,950
I do have your
bread, daddy.

234
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,460
I think you want
to talk to me.

235
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:46,950
Give me the money first.

236
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,960
Uh-uh, baby. Talk.

237
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,510
You've been making
out like a fat rat

238
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:05,010
in a cheese factory, my man.

239
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:06,510
We need to discuss that.

240
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,000
Just give me my money, Powell.

241
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,490
I don't want to talk.

242
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,490
Oh, that's no way
to negotiate, daddy-o.

243
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,480
Be cool or all
rent will stop.

244
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,480
That means no money.
Zero.

245
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:17,990
You can't do that.

246
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,990
I've done it
all over Harlem.

247
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,480
And your colleagues
have discovered

248
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,470
that it's good business
to do business with me.

249
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,940
Here's the deal:

250
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,950
you get half the rent
until you've delivered

251
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,960
on the list of repairs
that need to be done
in this building.

252
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:36,430
Meanwhile, we'll negotiate
fair rents across the board.

253
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,910
It's your best bet, Big O.

254
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,410
And God will look
kindly on you, too.

255
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:53,890
Let's go.

256
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:56,380
Mr. O'Malley,
one more thing:

257
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,850
The first thing
on your list...

258
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,350
fix Shackelford's door.

259
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,800
O'MALLEY:
Let's get out of here!

260
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,300
( crowd murmuring )

261
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,810
MAN:
God bless you,
Reverend Powell.

262
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,310
Thank you,
Reverend.

263
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,320
WOMAN:
Thank you,
Reverend Powell!

264
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,310
WOMAN 2:
I'll see you Sunday,
Reverend!

265
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,310
MAN 2:
Amen!

266
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,810
I saved your hide, Shack.

267
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,820
I expect to see you
in church this Sunday

268
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,320
so we can work
on your soul.

269
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,830
Yes, sir,
Reverend Powell.

270
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,320
I'll be in church Sunday.

271
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,820
Definitely.

272
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:32,830
And bring the family.

273
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,340
Yes, sir.

274
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,330
The rest of y'all colored folks
in this building

275
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:37,830
y'all come too, now.

276
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:40,330
The Lord is our Shepherd, y'all.

277
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:45,330

( applause and shouting )

286
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:33,680
Sister Gwen Jones,
you and that choir

287
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:36,700
make even those among us
who are faking

288
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,670
singing with you
sound good.

289
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,150
Marvelous.
Really marvelous.

290
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,150
WOMAN:
Amen!

291
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:45,140
Good morning to you,
members of Abyssinian.

292
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:46,630
CONGREGATION:
Good morning.

293
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:47,890
I said "Good morning!"

294
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,390
CONGREGATION:
Good morning!

295
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,400
Ah...

296
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,390
( laughing )

297
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,890
Good people of Abyssinian,

298
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,400
every time I look around
this beautiful church

299
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,900
and see the beautiful people,

300
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,910
I am compelled to have
to bring to the attention

301
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,400
of people who are newcomers,
the chief reason

302
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,000
that we are here
in this beautiful structure,

303
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,500
and that is primarily
through the efforts of my father

304
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,010
Adam Clayton Powell Sr...

305
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:11,000
( applause )

306
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:15,210
...the loving devotion of his
wife, my mother, Mattie Powell.

307
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:17,700
( applause )

308
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,200
And, of course,
my lovely wife,
as well-- Isabel.

309
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,200
Please stand up.

310
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:25,210
( applause )

311
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:28,220
And, of course, through
the efforts of all of you.

312
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,710
Brothers and sisters,

313
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:32,190
we have with us today
very distinguished guests,

314
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,210
members of New York City's
political hierarchy.

315
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,200
Powerful men
who make things happen.

316
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,700
We have our fine mayor,
and former Congressman,

317
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,560
Fiorello La Guardia

318
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,050
the "Little Flower."

319
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,520
Please stand,
Mr. Mayor.

320
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:48,640
No, I said,
"Please stand, Mr. Mayor."

321
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,120
All of his political
associates--

322
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,630
these distinguished gentlemen
who have come down.

323
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:59,100
( applause continues )

324
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:01,620
Brothers and sisters,
today we're going to have a...

325
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,090
"Sunday,
come to meeting."

326
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,600
It is Sunday,
and you have
come to meeting.

327
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,220
( chuckling )

328
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,720
My father always taught me,

329
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,940
he always taught me
to preach

330
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,440
with all your heart,
your mind and your soul

331
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,330
the old-time simple gospel.

332
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,820
That's right.
That's right.

333
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:19,320
Given the fact that
we have the powerful men

334
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,330
who do make things happen
in this city...

335
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:26,830
we're going to use as our text
Matthew 23, verse 21.

336
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,340
( congregation agreeing )

337
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,340
It says,
"Render therefore to Caesar

338
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,850
"the things that are Caesar's

339
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,840
and to God
the things that are God's."

340
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:39,850
Brothers and sisters,
our message today:

341
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:42,110
"Sharing the Wealth."

342
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,470
LA GUARDIA:
Reverend Powell, I think
the root of our problem is

343
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:48,200
that you don't understand
how government works.

344
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:49,700
Well, perhaps if I came up there

345
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,690
and joined the City Council,
Mr. Mayor,

346
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:52,420
I could learn.

347
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:53,930
( laughing )

348
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,440
No, no, no, no, no.

349
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,930
Your place is right here

350
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,930
in the community,
in front of

351
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,440
your people...

352
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,580
on Sunday mornings...

353
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:05,040
attending their spiritual needs.

354
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,540
POLITICO:
Besides...

355
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,760
even if you got
all the votes in Harlem,

356
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,090
you still wouldn't
have enough

357
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,100
to make City Council.

358
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,610
You'll need some white votes
to win citywide.

359
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,080
You deliver us
the Negro votes
that we need

360
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:22,600
and we may find
a little extra something...

361
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:24,200
just for you.

362
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,960
I appreciate this
donation to my
congregation

363
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,050
but I, uh...

364
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:36,550
I had something
a little more equitable in mind.

365
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,560
Arnold...

366
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,560
Arnold, give this
to Hattie, over
at the church.

367
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,300
Tell her it's a
municipal contribution.

368
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,800
ARNOLD:
I'll do it now.

369
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:48,270
Now, gentlemen, let's get
down to the brass tacks.

370
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:50,760
When I spoke
of sharing the wealth,

371
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,250
I meant in terms of jobs,
opportunity,

372
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,760
opening up the city

373
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,250
to all the people.

374
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,220
Frankie...

375
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,600
Mm-hmm?

376
00:17:59,080 --> 00:17:59,700
Another round.

377
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:04,400
I always find that scotch
warms a conversation, don't you?

378
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,890
To sharing
the wealth.

379
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:08,890
( laughing )

380
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:11,230
So these three yachts
I read about

381
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,840
were actually a dinghy,
a small motorboat

382
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,340
and an old fishing
boat that belonged
to your father?

383
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,350
You know how the press
exaggerates.

384
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,850
You're one of them.

385
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,360
Basically, you're telling me
it's all smoke and no fire.

386
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:26,320
Now, brother,
I didn't say all that.

387
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,320
I go first-class
every chance I get,

388
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,820
just like my colleagues,

389
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,830
only I refuse to be
a sneak and a liar

390
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:32,800
like them.

391
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,300
So you don't mind admitting

392
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,300
that you took money
off the record,

393
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,770
under the table,
so to speak?

394
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:42,780
Who'd you say you work for
again, J. Edgar Hoover?

395
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:43,750
No...

396
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,230
Black Reporter.
Black newspaper.

397
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:50,230
Ultimately, I serve
the same people you represented

398
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,240
when you weren't
down here fishing.

399
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,210
POWELL:
I've been serving the people

400
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,710
since before you were born,
Mr. Schiller.

401
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,180
Sit down.

402
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,690
Would you like
an Irish whiskey?

403
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,190
If you're joining me.

404
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,190
Certainly.

405
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,670
A lot of your people
ride the city buses

406
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:07,680
that my transport workers union
is striking against.

407
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:09,770
Mr. Quill...

408
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,280
your union has a total workforce
of 3,202 members.

409
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,280
Only 14 are Negroes

410
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,140
and all of them are
low-end porters.

411
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:18,600
I want drivers and mechanics.

412
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,960
That'll take time.

413
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,980
There's a seniority system

414
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:25,100
that must be
honored.

415
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:27,110
I can't take that
back uptown with me.

416
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:29,080
Negro passengers

417
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,320
pay the fares and all they see

418
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,810
are white people
in the drivers' seats?

419
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,310
If that's all
they're going to see

420
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,320
after helping you
attain your goals

421
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,820
why the hell bother?

422
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,820
I'm prepared

423
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:41,190
to offer you apprentice
situations as a start.

424
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,200
When the older workers retire

425
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:46,690
then the younger people
will be capable of moving

426
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,320
into their positions.

427
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,810
Not good enough.

428
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:50,310
If we help you
get what you want

429
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,320
we need to see Negroes
in some of those drivers' seats.

430
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,550
Let me think about it.

431
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,770
I'll see what

432
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,270
I can come up with.

433
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,360
The bus company will meet
your demands in no time

434
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,860
if we can come to an agreement.

435
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:08,870
I guarantee empty buses

436
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,610
rolling through
Harlem.

437
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,810
I wish I had you
working for me

438
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:16,310
in my union,
Mr. Powell.

439
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:19,200
If I were in your union,
Mr. Quill,

440
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,200
you'd be working for me.

441
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,960
( laughing )

442
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:30,450
Well, then a fine battle we'd
have on our hands, my friend.

443
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:54,070
We'll have to be keeping
an eye on that one.

444
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,560
Weren't you the one who told me
that any church

445
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:59,070
that was inactive
in the community was worthless?

446
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,070
Will you quit

447
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,410
using my words
to fit your purposes?

448
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,400
I said "active"

449
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:07,650
not hooked up with a bunch
of radical hoodlums

450
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,140
attacking everything in sight.

451
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,640
My radical hoodlums
have gotten jobs

452
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:11,650
for Negroes all
over New York.

453
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:14,150
Department stores,
the electric company
or phone company.

454
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:16,120
Even those Negroes who've been
talking behind my back.

455
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,590
Will you two lower your voices?

456
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,570
It took me years

457
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:22,050
to build up my congregation.

458
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,560
I did it by not leaving

459
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,570
anyone behind.

460
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,660
Negroes are basically
conservative, son.

461
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,660
At least the ones
you can count on.

462
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:33,170
You can't leave
your base support behind

463
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:35,540
and be running
all up and down the streets

464
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,540
acting wild and crazy.

465
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,510
Our "Don't Buy
Where You Can't Work" campaign

466
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:40,010
has gotten Negroes hired
where their money

467
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,010
was taken for granted.

468
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,510
When the board agreed
to let you take my place

469
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:45,510
they trusted that
you would continue things

470
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,020
the way they were,
and I thought you would, too.

471
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,490
Well, it's a new age,
Father P.

472
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:50,990
Maybe it calls
for new strategies.

473
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:51,980
Hush, now, Adam.

474
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:56,470
Listen to your father.

475
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,980
FATHER:
Son...

476
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,580
I don't think it's a good idea

477
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:03,590
for you to get all involved in
white people's union problems.

478
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:07,310
To be most effective, a Negro
leader must be independent.

479
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,330
I'll always stay independent,
Father P.

480
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,820
But in order to put out fires

481
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,320
you got to deal with the people
who own the water.

482
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:15,330
And until I can get up in there

483
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:18,340
that's white unions, white
government, and white people.

484
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:21,310
You can lead this church,

485
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,820
or you can get
involved in politics.

486
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,330
But if you fight
too many battles

487
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,800
on too many fronts,

488
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:30,310
you just may lose the war.

489
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:37,810
POWELL:
Let those hypocrites downtown

490
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:40,670
know that we here at home...

491
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,180
( people shouting )

492
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:46,170
PEOPLE ( chanting ):
Don't ride the buses!

493
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,530
( horn honking )

494
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:50,030
Miss Scott, I should have taken
another route.

495
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:53,040
Troublemakers.

496
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:55,030
Oh, on the contrary,
they're heroes.

497
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:58,030
It's just too bad they don't
know how to get out of the way

498
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,040
so we won't be late
this afternoon.

499
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,020
Are we going to ride that lousy

500
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,880
stinking, nasty bus?!

501
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:11,890
PEOPLE ( chanting ):
Don't ride the buses!
Don't ride the buses!

502
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:17,350
Don't ride the buses!
Don't ride the buses!

503
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,360
( horn honking )

504
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,870
( chanting continues )

505
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,360
Don't ride the buses!

506
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,580
You see that, uh,
well-dressed, nosy one?

507
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:33,330
Obviously,
Mr. Powell himself.

508
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:44,010
Excuse me, uh...

509
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,410
can we get through?

510
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,900
You're Hazel Scott.

511
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,610
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

512
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,080
And who are you?

513
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:52,080
You don't know who I am?

514
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:54,070
I'm the big bad wolf.

515
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,450
Oh. Well, nice to meet you,
Mr. Big Bad Wolf.

516
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:59,950
Now, can you clear a path
for us?

517
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:02,330
Maybe I should detain you
for a while.

518
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:04,850
Make you picket
with us proletariat

519
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:06,350
for a minute or two.

520
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,850
It'd be great for morale.

521
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,840
Now, Mr. Wolf, you are not
that big and bad.

522
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,940
( sighs )

523
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:18,180
Open up a path
here! Open!

524
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,680
Miss Hazel Scott
is coming through.

525
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:23,190
I have no problem
picketing

526
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,560
with my people,
Mr. Big Bad Wolf.

527
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,060
I just have to be somewhere
this afternoon.

528
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:30,520
The name's
Adam Clayton Powell, Junior.

529
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,990
I'll pretend like
I believe you've
never heard of me.

530
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,490
Either way, I promise you'll be
more aware of me in the future.

531
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,940
( all chanting ):
Don't ride the buses!

532
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,440
Open up!

533
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,540
Open up a path!

534
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:50,050
( chanting continues )

535
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,560
Hold up, cats.

536
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:55,030
Got to make sure
you get my best side.

537
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:02,030
...beating the forces of New
York City that did not want you

538
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:05,540
to have control of your own
lives and your own unions!

539
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:09,400
( crowd talking )

540
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,900
What? Let me hear you!

541
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:15,910
Let them hear
you downtown!

542
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,410
Let them hear
you uptown!

543
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:19,920
Let them hear you
all over this town!

544
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:22,410
Powell for City Council!

545
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:23,510
All right, y'all.

546
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,020
Right there, baby.

547
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:28,860
( all chanting ):
Powell for City Council!

548
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,860
One more time.

549
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:36,100
Amen, baby, amen.

550
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,200
Do you remember when

551
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:41,070
there were no Negro workers
in those stores?

552
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,920
I do solemnly swear to abide by

553
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,420
the charter
of the city of New York

554
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,430
so help me God.

555
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,640
It was so boring.

556
00:26:56,650 --> 00:27:00,160
Actually I couldn't believe
that I was raised there.

557
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,580
Could you?

558
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:06,380
( classical music playing )

559
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,640
( applause )

560
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:37,590
( starts playing
classical music )

561
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:41,090
( stops playing )

562
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:43,590
( starts playing jazz )

563
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,100
( audience murmurs
in appreciation )

564
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:04,310
( applause )

565
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,120
You know who
I am yet?

566
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,610
Hmm...

567
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:29,080
( chuckles )

568
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:32,040
New York's first
Negro city councilman.

569
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,510
Congratulations.

570
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:35,510
I get your drink right?

571
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:39,500
Shouldn't you be out
kissing babies

572
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,000
or at home with your wife?

573
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Something suitable

574
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,380
for a city councilman.

575
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:46,870
I belong to the people.

576
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,100
Not being naughty now, are we?

577
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:49,590
I'm trying
to be nice.

578
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,700
Who knows?

579
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:54,700
Maybe I could, uh,
win your vote.

580
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,710
May I?

581
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,910
Suit yourself.

582
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,300
You know, we have
a lot in common.

583
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:04,020
Do we?

584
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:06,020
We're both very interested in
getting to know each other.

585
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:09,110
You are a hoot
and a scoundrel.

586
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:12,580
Glad I made a
good impression.

587
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,580
( chuckles )

588
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:19,550
Garçon, more champagne.

589
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:23,070
MAN:
Right away,
Mr. Councilman.

590
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:25,180
There really ought to be
a warning label

591
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,680
on men who belong
to the people first.

592
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,680
Some manage.

593
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,680
A lot less than people
care to admit.

594
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:32,190
Your father did.

595
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:34,190
My father wanted
to be a congressman

596
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:36,700
but he never got on
the political boat like I did.

597
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:38,690
He did his work
through the church.

598
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:41,190
So, you went
beyond the church
and the family

599
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,700
and into politics
because you
felt the need

600
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,210
to accomplish more
than your father?

601
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,700
And I did this because
I was in competition

602
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:53,210
with my father for the love
of my mother.

603
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:54,210
Make good copy.

604
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,220
Domino.

605
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,710
( groans )

606
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,710
Thank you, my friend.

607
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,720
You know how to play dominoes?

608
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,720
Uh, no.

609
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,730
Well, sit down, let me
baptize you a little bit.

610
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,220
Ferdinand, why don't you...

611
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,720
you and Mike go over
to the bar, belly up.

612
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,720
My friend Joe's going
to buy you a drink.

613
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:12,730
In fact, Joe's buying drinks
for everybody in the bar!

614
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,730
Another round.

615
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,240
( cheers )

616
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,340
Look, um, you know,
I don't work for the Times.

617
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:24,340
Not yet, my
friend, not yet.

618
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,350
So, uh, when exactly
did you decide

619
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,340
you were going to go

620
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,340
for the new congressional seat
for Harlem?

621
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,320
The minute I heard
there might be

622
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,340
a new congressional
district created
for Harlem.

623
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:36,300
White people had been
representing Harlem
for too long.

624
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,300
Or should I say
they'd been

625
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,800
taking Harlem for
granted long enough.

626
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,800
I couldn't think of a
better man for the job.

627
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:43,930
Most people figured
A. Philip Randolph deserved it,

628
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:45,930
and, uh, some say
you stole it.

629
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:49,410
If I remember correctly,

630
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:52,410
I was voted into Congress
by the people of Harlem.

631
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:55,390
But you did know
there was a big movement

632
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:56,890
to draft A. Philip Randolph.

633
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:03,130
I can think of no other man
I respect more for his efforts

634
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,130
in the same struggle as I

635
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:08,640
as the man we honor tonight,
Mr. A. Philip Randolph,

636
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:10,630
founder and president

637
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,140
of the Brotherhood
of Sleeping Car Porters!

638
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,880
( cheering and applause )

639
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,350
Find Reverend Powell
and tell him.

640
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,850
Have you got that?

641
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:23,850
( people talking in background )

642
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,350
The order's
been changed.

643
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:31,850
Ray Jones doesn't trust
Powell to go first

644
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:34,360
So, we got to find Powell
before he goes on stage.

645
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,370
Reverend Powell...

646
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,360
Reverend Powell, sir.

647
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,360
Is there a problem?

648
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,860
There's been a slight
change of plans.

649
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:42,370
Instead of introducing
Mr. Randolph

650
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:43,370
we would like you

651
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:44,360
to close
the prayer.

652
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:46,850
That means we'll throw away
the speech I've been working on

653
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,340
for the past two weeks.

654
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,810
Whose bad idea is this anyway?

655
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,260
Unless Mr. Randolph
tells me personally

656
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:59,770
that he wants things
to go differently,
I'm on next.

657
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:01,720
But, sir...

658
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,730
Ray Jones.

659
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,220
Hello, Adam.

660
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,690
Sure looks like
they're ready for
A. Philip tonight.

661
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:08,690
Yes, it does.

662
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:11,190
Better go warm up the
stage for him, shall I?

663
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,690
Wait a minute, Adam,
I think there's been
a change in the order.

664
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,660
No, no, not at all.

665
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:16,670
You know, we should
work together sometime

666
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:17,620
you and me.

667
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,130
I like the way
you think.

668
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,090
And I have a feeling
that history--

669
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:27,090
political history-- will be
changed by some of the things

670
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:30,600
that may be put in motion
here tonight.

671
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,850
( cheering )

672
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:34,810
Well, wish me luck.

673
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,380
( band playing march )

674
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:45,860
( talking in background )

675
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,370
( cheering and applause )

676
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:58,620
A. Philip Randolph!

677
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,480
( cheering and whistling )

678
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:23,480
A. Philip Randolph,
we welcome you.

679
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:26,460
My City of New York.

680
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:28,430
My kingdom of Harlem!

681
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,450
( cheering and stomping )

682
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:45,180
We have important business...
to discuss tonight--

683
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:48,400
important business--

684
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:50,720
and I, your humble
little parish priest

685
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:53,740
will make sure that that
business is done correctly.

686
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:57,210
I shall try to
keep my remarks

687
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:59,710
down... but nonetheless,

688
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,690
I shall try to make them
like a woman's skirt--

689
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:04,190
long enough to be respectable,

690
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:06,190
but short enough
to be interesting.

691
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:08,170
( laughing )

692
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:14,180
Many people
may wonder why

693
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:16,680
from time to time

694
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:19,670
we must come together
as a Negro people

695
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:25,170
at events such as these
to protest the unfair treatment

696
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,690
that is being heaped
upon Negroes

697
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:29,680
throughout this country
and throughout the world...

698
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,680
( cheering )

699
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:33,690
...but I say
the protest has a purpose.

700
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:38,200
I say there are measurable gains
to be made when a person says,

701
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:40,190
"Get off of my neck."

702
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:45,200
I say it's because we protested
that we Negro people in New York

703
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,710
have the first Negro councilman
in City Hall.

704
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:49,700
( crowd roaring )

705
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:54,540
It is because we protested

706
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:57,540
that we desegregated
all the stores

707
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:01,550
on 125th Street in Harlem...

708
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:03,560
but it is now time

709
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:07,050
for the first Negro congressman
from New York.

710
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,660
( cheering and whistling )

711
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:15,900
Therefore...

712
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,990
I must...

713
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,990
in spite of time, energy
and prior commitments...

714
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:25,500
I must run for the Congress

715
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:29,470
of the United States
of America...

716
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,980
( cheering and stomping )

717
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,320
( cheering and stomping
continue )

718
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:45,940
...so that we, Harlem,
may have a national voice

719
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,940
speaking
from your national capital!

720
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:49,950
( cheering )

721
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:54,960
"Why the Negro?"
many of you will ask.

722
00:35:54,950 --> 00:36:00,450
I, Adam Powell,
am in a position to answer that

723
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:03,470
because I, Adam Powell,
may belong to a group of people

724
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:06,960
that some others may think
are inferior

725
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:09,470
but I belong
to a group of people that God--

726
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:12,730
omniscient, omnipresent God,
God of all power--

727
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,220
says, "You're my children,

728
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,720
and you're the same
as anyone else,"

729
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:20,230
and with that kind of faith
in me and courage in me

730
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:22,740
I know I can be as good,
if not better

731
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:25,730
than anyone who walks
the halls of Congress.

732
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:27,710
( roaring )

733
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:33,720
Doesn't matter what ticket
or what party--

734
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:38,730
my people demand a forthright,
militant, anti-Uncle Tom

735
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:39,840
congressman!

736
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,830
( crowd roaring )

737
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:53,790
My cry today
and until the day I die

738
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,050
is, "Let my people go, now!"

739
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:59,420
( cheering and whistling )

740
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,630
( piano playing )

741
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:16,130
What do you want,
Mr. Powell?

742
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:18,130
A better world
for all.

743
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:22,140
And where, may I ask,
do you think I fit in?

744
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,150
I don't know yet.

745
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,140
( piano notes clunk )

746
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,140
( chuckles )

747
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,640
Your wife must have
the commitment of Job.

748
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:29,650
She knows who I am.

749
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:31,650
Does she?

750
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:33,160
Really?

751
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,650
Some people know me,
Miss Scott.

752
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:38,120
Would you like to?

753
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,620
Depends on what kind
of student you are.

754
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:42,130
A very good student,
Miss Scott.

755
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:43,130
How good of a teacher
are you?

756
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:44,630
I'm a very good teacher.

757
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,640
Prove it to me.

758
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,630
Well, let's start with,
uh, some "Chopsticks."

759
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:48,630
"Chopsticks"?

760
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:51,630
That's advanced.

761
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,490
It's still early.

762
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:55,490
I always go to bed early.

763
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:58,500
My father insisted if
I didn't get enough rest,

764
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:01,490
I'd end up with bags
like Duke Ellington.

765
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,500
Um... my, uh,
my bag's at your place.

766
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,010
Well, send somebody by
and bring it to you.

767
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,500
You're not going to invite me
to spend the night?

768
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,730
My dear, new, best friend

769
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:13,750
I have absolutely no interest
in you spending the night.

770
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,220
You're the wrong gender.

771
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,230
That's cold, man.

772
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:20,240
You realize you spent
a good deal of my money

773
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:23,730
on drinks for your friends,
who seem to be everybody?

774
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,710
Thank you very much.

775
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,200
Very generous of you.

776
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,200
See you tomorrow,

777
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:27,810
I'm sure.

778
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:29,810
Good night,
Mr. Schiller.

779
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:31,310
Bon soir, Freddy.

780
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:33,780
Bye. Nice party.
Good night.

781
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:41,630
You realize we're causing
a scandal.

782
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,140
Tongues are beginning
to wag.

783
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,650
I hadn't notice anything...
except you.

784
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,610
You notice.

785
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:51,110
You notice everything.

786
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:54,110
Are you willing
to hurt anyone

787
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,620
to get what you want?

788
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,610
I'm willing to be honest.
Are you?

789
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,100
I'm always honest.

790
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,080
Then, tell me honestly
what you want.

791
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:05,100
What I have... and a family.

792
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:07,590
Are you proposing to me?

793
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,590
( laughing )

794
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,080
You are a politician...

795
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:14,580
an already very-married
politician, lest we forget.

796
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,800
And for you, sir.

797
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:22,310
When it comes to women,

798
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:24,780
you are definitely
not to be trusted.

799
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,290
Oh, I can be trusted

800
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,260
once I'm understood.

801
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:32,260
I will admit, uh,
being Mrs. Adam Clayton Powell

802
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:33,730
isn't always easy.

803
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:36,750
I wouldn't think being
Mrs. Adam Clayton Powell

804
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,740
would be any harder
than being

805
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:41,720
Mr. Hazel Scott,
actually.

806
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,220
Touche.

807
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,710
( chuckling )

808
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,700
Touche.

809
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,680
( laughing )

810
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:53,310
Fishing is like women.

811
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:56,050
Once you develop the touch,
the fish find you.

812
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,040
( chuckles )

813
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:59,550
Of course, you don't want
every fish to find you.

814
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:02,010
So, when you broke up
with Isabel

815
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,020
you were free
to see Hazel openly.

816
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,010
Well, actually, it was
Isabel who was let free.

817
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
That's one way of looking at it
without feeling guilty.

818
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:10,480
No, I feel guilty about it.

819
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,980
She was given a raw deal.

820
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:14,070
This is the end,
bunny girl.
I'm sorry.

821
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:19,030
Why?

822
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:23,520
Because once upon a time,
you were ahead of me.

823
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,020
Then I caught you,

824
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,490
then I passed you.

825
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:29,860
I can't sustain
the distance.

826
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:34,850
( crying )

827
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,310
But she hated politics.

828
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,300
I was moving
into the big time.

829
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:45,050
( horn honking )

830
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:50,040
( chanting ):
Powell! Powell! Powell! Powell!

831
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:53,060
( chanting continuing )

832
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,320
Who do we want
in Congress?

833
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:12,830
Powell!

834
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:15,780
Now, I want all of you
to take every one of those signs

835
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:18,800
and walk throughout
the entire City of New York.

836
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:20,790
Are we willing
to work together?
Yeah!

837
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,800
To fight together?
Yeah!

838
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,300
To worship together?
Yeah!

839
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,800
To win together?
Yeah!

840
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,810
To vote together?
Yeah!

841
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:31,800
Walk together, children.
Don't you get weary.

842
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:34,310
POWELL:
While the talk of New York City

843
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:36,820
was the spectacular
wedding reception we had

844
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:38,310
at cafe society

845
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:41,810
Hazel and I chose
to have our actual wedding be

846
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:44,320
a small, private affair
out of town.

847
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:47,310
The king had his queen
and was ready to roll.

848
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:49,910
MAN ( over newsreel ):
The preacher from Harlem
arrives in Washington!

849
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,660
POWELL:
I was elected to Congress
by Harlem

850
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,670
but I was the representative
in government

851
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,160
for every black person
in America.

852
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,640
Thank you.

853
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:18,650
All these love letters.

854
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:21,650
And there's more
in your office,
in Odell's office

855
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,660
in Waldo and
Maxine's office

856
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:25,660
and in the downstairs
post office.

857
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:27,670
I want information
on every congressman...

858
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:28,660
every congressman's staff.

859
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:29,660
I want to know every bill

860
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,660
that's been passed
the last ten years

861
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:33,170
and how those bills
got passed.

862
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:34,670
I want to know who's who,
what who wants

863
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:35,670
and how they think.

864
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:37,170
Yes, Adam.

865
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:39,670
Gossip, skeletons...
weaknesses, strengths, dirt--

866
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:41,170
we need every advantage
we can get.

867
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:44,180
I want to move so fast
we make half the Congress dizzy,

868
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:46,190
the other half pass out
from exhaustion.

869
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:49,180
Everybody knows there's
a bad Negro in Congress now.

870
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,180
I want you all to be known
as my bad Negro staff.

871
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:53,690
WOMAN:
Yes, sir.

872
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:56,700
( phone ringing )

873
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:58,150
( chuckles )

874
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,670
( speaking
indistinctly )

875
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:13,210
Hey, boy...

876
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:17,720
you seen that new Negro
Congressman Powell yet?

877
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:20,210
No, sir, not
that I know of.

878
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:22,710
Oh, you'll know him--

879
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,720
Colored man
with a big mouth.

880
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:28,230
Thinks he's going
to come down here

881
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:29,720
and raise hell.

882
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:32,220
That boy's got
some big surprises

883
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:33,730
in store for him.

884
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:36,740
Congressman Rankin
from Mississippi.

885
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:38,230
Senator Bilbo.

886
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:41,230
I recognize you boys, too.

887
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:45,240
I think it's a damn disgrace
you got elected, Powell.

888
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:48,750
Now, don't you sit
anywhere near me, hear?

889
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:50,740
You better
watch yourself.

890
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:52,250
This ain't New York.

891
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:54,250
( elevator bell dings )

892
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,620
Southern rules govern
this city.

893
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:03,100
( elevator bell dings )

894
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:20,000
My, my, Grandma...

895
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,990
what a red neck you have.

896
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,240
A lot of folks think

897
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:29,230
I'm the first and only
Negro up in here.

898
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:30,730
Now, now, Adam,
that's not fair

899
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,740
to Congressman Dawson
from Chicago.

900
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:33,740
Now, he may
not be as...

901
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:34,740
Cool.

902
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,750
My, you do wonders
for a size four.

903
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:38,740
Parisian?

904
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:41,240
Actually, confrontational
was what I had in mind.

905
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:43,750
But I hear he makes
progress... quietly.

906
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:45,250
Nonsense.
Keep walking, Hattie.

907
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:47,240
Progress is
a bloody guerrilla war.

908
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:50,240
You have to keep pushing,
plotting, scratching, fighting.

909
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,240
Never let them rest.

910
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,240
Keep them squirming.

911
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,750
Be a burr in their saddle.

912
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:56,240
Otherwise, they control
and define your progress--

913
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,240
you crawl after scraps.

914
00:44:57,250 --> 00:44:59,250
Well, I don't think
I'll be able to eat

915
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:01,250
with all these people
staring at me.

916
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:04,260
Think of it this
way, Hattie, you're
not just eating to eat.

917
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:06,250
You're eating to help
the whole human race.

918
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:08,250
You're eating to help
these poor souls evolve.

919
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:11,260
Adam, I'm eating
'cause you're
dragging me.

920
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:12,770
That, too.

921
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,740
...lobster bisque
for miles away.

922
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:16,250
My father cooked it
almost every...

923
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:18,590
( room grows quiet )

924
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:21,550
MAN:
Good afternoon.

925
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:24,030
I'm sorry, there's
absolutely no seats
anywhere, sir.

926
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,540
Oh, no, no,
not at all.

927
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:27,050
We'll just take
those chairs there.

928
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,040
Please, sir.

929
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,410
Please.

930
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:50,720
Congressman Rankin

931
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,340
how nice of you
to stand.

932
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:55,270
Yes, I know that
Congressman Dawson

933
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:58,260
and other Negroes aren't
allowed to eat here, but...

934
00:45:58,260 --> 00:45:59,760
things will be changing.

935
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:16,450
Bye, y'all.

936
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:40,250
Ah, my good friend.

937
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:41,750
Yes, sir?

938
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:45,260
Listen, brother, I
know with all these
good old boys around

939
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:47,250
there's got to be
some fried chicken

940
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:48,750
and collard greens around.

941
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,760
We need to fatten
her up...

942
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:51,760
I'm kidding.

943
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,770
Whatever's the
chef's special and
two house salads.

944
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,760
Yes, sir.

945
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,760
Make sure they
don't spit in it.

946
00:46:59,770 --> 00:47:01,770
Lunch smells good.

947
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,290
( knocking )

948
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,780
Come in.
It's not locked.

949
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:26,270
Compliments of Miss Hazel Scott.

950
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:30,740
Thank you, Walter.

951
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:49,730
Since I was in
the neighborhood

952
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:52,230
I thought I'd drop by

953
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:55,240
and give you dinner...

954
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,750
and a show.

955
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:02,240
Since you did forget
our dinner date tonight.

956
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:03,740
I'm sorry, baby.

957
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:05,710
I'm sure you are.

958
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,730
Why don't you come
here, brown sugar.

959
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:18,230
No, no, no.

960
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:20,740
You just keep on working.

961
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:22,730
Just tell me what
I can do.

962
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,700
( chuckles )

963
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:31,700
You know, I do believe
in accomplishment.

964
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:35,720
Even though I loathe
DC politics.

965
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:38,690
It's horse manure.

966
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:41,210
What did I do right?

967
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,700
You're a dream.

968
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,700
I know.

969
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:46,710
Don't wake me.

970
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:49,210
What's the matter with
me forgetting dinner

971
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:50,720
with a beautiful
creature like you.

972
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:52,210
I don't know.

973
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,210
But...

974
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,700
Don't let it happen again.

975
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:02,710
Or what?

976
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:06,210
Or I'll have
to punish you.

977
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:08,220
Is that a promise?

978
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:10,210
Yeah.

979
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:17,970
You know, I actually
think Hazel

980
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:20,970
hated the game of politics
more than Isabelle.

981
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:22,480
She was a natural activist.

982
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,470
Smartest woman I ever met...

983
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:26,460
and the least tolerant.

984
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:28,190
Of what?

985
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,210
Hazel's West Indian.

986
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,200
Like Ray Jones.

987
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,200
Proud as hell,
sensitive to slights.

988
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:37,210
They come from a place
where being black is the rule

989
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:38,710
not the exception.

990
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:41,220
Add to that the complexity
of the British influence--

991
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:42,710
aloof and slightly superior--

992
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:44,710
I think there were damn few
white Americans

993
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:47,190
Hazel met she didn't feel
superior to.

994
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:52,670
So, did Hazel's
superior attitude

995
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:56,670
ever give you any problems
as an American black?

996
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:57,680
Are you crazy?

997
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,180
I loved her for it.

998
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:01,190
She was as bold
as I was.

999
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:03,180
Well, almost.

1000
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,920
( piano playing )

1001
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:09,540
( dramatic piano music )

1002
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:20,540
Bravo.

1003
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:22,360
Magnificent.

1004
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:28,800
What, baby?

1005
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:30,320
What did I do now?

1006
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:34,810
Nothing, Adam.

1007
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:36,820
Absolutely nothing.

1008
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:40,830
First time I ever got
in trouble for that.

1009
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:43,320
Lady, you're
polishing silverware.

1010
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:45,320
You don't do chores.

1011
00:50:45,330 --> 00:50:46,820
I may as well start.

1012
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:49,810
Get on my knees,
scrub the floor

1013
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,290
walk around with
my head down,

1014
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,260
don't look at anybody
in the eye.

1015
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:56,270
Sure as hell
doesn't mean anything

1016
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:58,280
to be a Congressman's wife
around here.

1017
00:50:58,270 --> 00:51:00,250
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1018
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:01,760
Wait.

1019
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:02,760
What's going on?

1020
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,770
Is this about
Constitution Hall?

1021
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:07,740
How did you know
that, Adam?

1022
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:09,730
Did you know
those witches

1023
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:12,730
were going to look
at me in the face

1024
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:14,740
and say I was
not allowed?

1025
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:15,710
No.

1026
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:19,210
They did that to
Marion Anderson
five years ago.

1027
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:22,220
I thought for sure
they would let you...

1028
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:24,690
It's a policy
that has to
be addressed.

1029
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:28,210
You used me.

1030
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,700
You set this up

1031
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:32,200
knowing that I was
going to be turned away.

1032
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:37,220
You couldn't be a pawn
on your worst day.

1033
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:41,210
Oh, don't touch me.

1034
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:48,660
Hazel, I'm sorry.

1035
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:50,160
Please forgive me.

1036
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:55,400
Those nothings had the nerve
to tell me, Hazel Scott

1037
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:58,900
who has performed for
crowned heads of Europe

1038
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:02,910
that I was not welcome
to perform at Constitution Hall.

1039
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:06,380
It was humiliating.

1040
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:07,500
You have every right
to perform

1041
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:09,490
at that hall.

1042
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,500
Don't you ever do that
to me again.

1043
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:23,870
( door slams )

1044
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:27,350
The President
will see you now.

1045
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:31,850
Thank you.

1046
00:52:44,310 --> 00:52:45,810
Congressman Powell.

1047
00:52:45,810 --> 00:52:48,780
Mr. President.

1048
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:51,780
Thank you for granting me
an unofficial visit.

1049
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:54,160
You have been busy.

1050
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:55,650
Thank you, sir.

1051
00:52:57,620 --> 00:52:59,120
It was not a compliment.

1052
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:03,640
This, uh, Powell Amendment

1053
00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:07,630
I hear you intend to attach
to bills in Congress

1054
00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:10,130
will mean nothing but trouble.

1055
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:12,600
The Powell Amendment
expresses my belief

1056
00:53:12,610 --> 00:53:15,610
that any money collected
from the public at large

1057
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:18,620
should not be
redistributed to
support in any way

1058
00:53:18,610 --> 00:53:20,610
any group that would
discriminate.

1059
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:22,620
Such a system
is unacceptable

1060
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:25,610
to any thinking person.

1061
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,230
To expect compliance
is stupid, really.

1062
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,740
It's like expecting someone
to pay for a house

1063
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:31,250
that they can't set foot in.

1064
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:35,240
Are you talking about
the concert your wife

1065
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:38,390
was prevented from doing
at Constitution Hall?

1066
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:40,380
The Daughters
of the American Revolution

1067
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:42,880
had no right to deny my wife
the right to perform there

1068
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:44,390
because of her color.

1069
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:47,900
Not to mention the fact
that Crispus Attucks, a Negro

1070
00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:49,890
was one of the first...
the first

1071
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:52,370
to die in the very
American Revolution they base

1072
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:53,490
their name on.

1073
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,960
I know how you feel about that.

1074
00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:55,970
I've read it

1075
00:53:55,970 --> 00:54:00,460
in every damn newspaper
that would listen to you.

1076
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:04,710
We pay taxes like everyone else.

1077
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:06,720
Those taxes help support
that hall

1078
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:09,210
and taxation without
representation is tyranny, sir.

1079
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,220
Well, even though you called
my wife--

1080
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:16,730
what was it--
"the last lady of the land"

1081
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,680
and anointed Eleanor Roosevelt

1082
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:21,030
as the "first..."

1083
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:22,390
Excuse me, sir.

1084
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:24,390
Please let me clarify.

1085
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:27,890
I made that distinction
because, as you know

1086
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:30,410
when the great singer
Marion Anderson

1087
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,400
was denied the right to perform
at Constitution Hall

1088
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:36,400
Mrs. Roosevelt resigned
her position in the DAR.

1089
00:54:36,410 --> 00:54:38,410
Whereas,
with all due respect, sir

1090
00:54:38,410 --> 00:54:41,150
your wife attended

1091
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:42,750
one of their tea parties.

1092
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:45,640
You, sir, are playing politics.

1093
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:47,000
You knew the policy.

1094
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
You set this
whole thing up

1095
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:51,490
to cause trouble.

1096
00:54:51,490 --> 00:54:54,500
I want to make one thing clear--

1097
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:59,990
my wife Bess bears no ill will
toward your wife or Negro people

1098
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
with her membership
in the DAR.

1099
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,760
You well know that neither of us

1100
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:10,750
have any control over management
or policy of private enterprise.

1101
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:12,260
Forgive me, sir

1102
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:14,270
but that's
precisely the point.

1103
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:16,980
It is not private enterprise
when public money is used

1104
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,480
to support the very institutions
that insult us.

1105
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:23,580
You're as stubborn
as I've heard.

1106
00:55:23,590 --> 00:55:27,200
I prefer to think of it as...

1107
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:28,690
proper determination.

1108
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:32,680
Well...

1109
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:39,910
Thank you for the visit,
Congressman Powell.

1110
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:48,380
Thank you,
Mr. President.

1111
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:50,390
The pleasure
was all mine.

1112
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:06,740
Tell him that this is precisely
the same problem...

1113
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:09,730
HAZEL:
Did you get
an apology?

1114
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:11,730
Hattie, will you excuse us?

1115
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:17,210
An invitation to perform
that I can turn down?

1116
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:21,470
No.

1117
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:24,460
No, the best I could get was, uh

1118
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:26,460
was to get him to say
that his wife didn't bear

1119
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:27,840
any ill will toward you.

1120
00:56:27,830 --> 00:56:30,330
No ill will...

1121
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:32,840
Ill will.

1122
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:35,350
Adam, you could've lied to me
and told me

1123
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:37,970
the man said
he was sorry.

1124
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:39,930
Does anyone in Washington
have sense?

1125
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:45,660
That includes you, Adam.

1126
00:56:45,650 --> 00:56:49,150
I wonder how you can hear
your fellow congressmen

1127
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:50,660
use the word "nigger"

1128
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:53,150
on the Congress
floor, and then

1129
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:54,110
you shake their hands

1130
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:55,610
and you smack them
on the back

1131
00:56:55,610 --> 00:56:57,610
as if they're friends.

1132
00:56:57,610 --> 00:56:58,610
Doesn't it drive you crazy?

1133
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:00,120
No.

1134
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:02,620
What drives me crazy
is when there's anybody

1135
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:04,630
who thinks that they have
the right to tell us no.

1136
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:06,120
Who thinks
that they can tell us--

1137
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:07,620
who helped build this country--

1138
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:10,570
that there's any place
that we can't go.

1139
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:11,550
So they can call me nigger,

1140
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:13,050
they can call me
anything they want to

1141
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:14,050
on the floors of that Congress,

1142
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:15,940
but I'll be damned
if I'm going to let them treat

1143
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:16,930
the future Hazel Scotts
of this world

1144
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:19,430
the way that they
treated you.

1145
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:20,940
And I don't
like it, baby.

1146
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:23,460
I don't like the rules
any more than you do.

1147
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:25,460
I'm going to shove
those goddamned rules

1148
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:26,970
down their throats

1149
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,960
until they change them.

1150
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:31,460
That's just what
I'm going to do.

1151
00:57:31,470 --> 00:57:34,470
I'm going to die trying.

1152
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:40,450
Well, you can't die yet.

1153
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:42,440
I still need you.

1154
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:45,440
What do you need me for?
You make more money than I do.

1155
00:57:45,450 --> 00:57:49,920
Well, I, uh, might

1156
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,910
have to take some
time off pretty soon.

1157
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:54,900
For what?

1158
00:57:54,910 --> 00:57:57,410
Don't you notice
anything about me
different?

1159
00:57:59,390 --> 00:58:01,870
A little, uh, weight gain?

1160
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:04,890
An aura? Glow maybe?

1161
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,610
Are you sure?

1162
00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:14,060
( chuckles )

1163
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:16,060
Positive.

1164
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:18,070
Oh, baby, that-that's
wonderful.

1165
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:20,060
That's wonderful news.

1166
00:58:21,570 --> 00:58:26,070
Now I'm going to need
a lot more of your time,
Mr. Powell, a lot more.

1167
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:28,040
Every second I can spare.

1168
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:33,770
( up-tempo jazz music plays )

1169
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:42,980
( scatting )

1170
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:38,700
( laughing )

1171
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:13,250
REPORTER:
Protests continue to come in
from around the world,

1172
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:14,570
as Julius and Ethel Rosenberg,

1173
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:17,750
convicted for giving atom bomb
secrets to the Russians,

1174
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:20,610
were the first U.S. civilians
to be executed for espionage.

1175
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:22,860
Proving that no one
is above suspicion,

1176
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:26,630
Senator Joseph McCarthy turned
his Communist hunting expertise

1177
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:29,050
toward our own Secretary of
the Army, Robert T. Stevens,

1178
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:30,930
for allegedly
hampering attempts

1179
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:32,730
to uncover Communists
in the military.

1180
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:34,840
White House news--
President Eisenhower

1181
01:00:34,830 --> 01:00:37,510
leads the first Republican
administration in 24 years...

1182
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:42,030
( slow jazz horn plays )

1183
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:05,990
( whistle blowing )

1184
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,990
( whistle blows )

1185
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:24,350
What made you change your mind
and invite me to stay?

1186
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:26,850
Well, you behaved
yourself,

1187
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:30,360
relatively speaking.

1188
01:01:30,350 --> 01:01:31,350
And you act like a man

1189
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:32,870
that's running
out of money.

1190
01:01:32,870 --> 01:01:33,870
Sensitivity?

1191
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:36,350
No.

1192
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:38,840
Pity.

1193
01:01:38,850 --> 01:01:40,850
It's the most useless emotion
in the universe.

1194
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:48,800
That medallion...

1195
01:01:48,810 --> 01:01:50,290
that was a gift

1196
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:52,280
from Haile Selassie, right?

1197
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:53,750
Yes.

1198
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:56,750
The great emperor gave me
this medallion

1199
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:58,750
when he came to visit me
at Abyssinia.

1200
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:04,250
It's the oldest dynasty
in the world

1201
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:07,250
started by King Solomon,
Makeda, Queen of Sheba.

1202
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:09,760
He also gave me
a solid gold cross

1203
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,750
that hangs
in Abyssinia.

1204
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:13,750
What was your greatest
accomplishment in life?

1205
01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:15,720
Ah, it's no question...

1206
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:17,220
my two sons.

1207
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:19,210
My oldest son

1208
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,200
my first born,
Adam III.

1209
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,180
You already know about him.

1210
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:24,700
He's a fine man

1211
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:26,170
his own man.

1212
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:28,670
This one...

1213
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:31,410
Adam IV...

1214
01:02:31,410 --> 01:02:34,410
Had him with
my third wife Yvette.

1215
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:36,920
Think he's going to follow
in my footsteps.

1216
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:38,890
Look at those eyes.

1217
01:02:38,890 --> 01:02:40,390
See that fire.

1218
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:51,100
Who is she?

1219
01:02:56,560 --> 01:03:00,550
That's my sister Blanche...

1220
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:02,540
the light of my formative years.

1221
01:03:04,550 --> 01:03:06,550
She died when I was 17.

1222
01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:09,550
I'm sorry.

1223
01:03:11,050 --> 01:03:13,050
Obviously, she meant
a lot to you.

1224
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:19,070
Yes, she did.

1225
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:23,530
Good-looking family.

1226
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:27,040
But I meant
in your work.

1227
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:28,510
What is your greatest
accomplishment in your career?

1228
01:03:28,510 --> 01:03:31,010
My career?

1229
01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:33,010
It's not over yet, my friend.

1230
01:03:33,010 --> 01:03:35,500
Well, you are at the age
where most folks retire.

1231
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:39,500
And you do seem
somewhat retired

1232
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:40,490
down here.

1233
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,480
Well, my accomplishments
are like my children.

1234
01:03:42,490 --> 01:03:44,990
I can't pick one
over the other.

1235
01:03:44,990 --> 01:03:47,500
Every successful
rent strike,

1236
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:50,990
every job I was
able to pry loose
for a black person,

1237
01:03:50,990 --> 01:03:52,990
every appointment I
enabled myself to make,

1238
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
every bill I got passed,

1239
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
every employer
I forced

1240
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,510
to give his workers
a minimum wage,

1241
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:01,000
every cracker I pissed off
because I out-slicked

1242
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,980
his ass...

1243
01:04:02,990 --> 01:04:05,500
I'll let
the history books decide.

1244
01:04:15,950 --> 01:04:18,950
Nights are bringing a little bit
more chill of late.

1245
01:04:24,930 --> 01:04:26,430
My greatest
accomplishment may be

1246
01:04:26,430 --> 01:04:29,940
that I survived
for so damn long.

1247
01:04:29,930 --> 01:04:31,900
Mr. Speaker,
I'm sure you'll fully

1248
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:33,600
appreciate the irony

1249
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:36,100
of my having to come
to the halls of Congress

1250
01:04:36,110 --> 01:04:38,110
to sue for the right
for Negro criminals

1251
01:04:38,110 --> 01:04:41,120
to have a fair shot at crime
in their own communities.

1252
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:42,610
The fact of the matter is,

1253
01:04:42,610 --> 01:04:46,110
that corruption involving
organized crime, the Mob,

1254
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:49,120
and the New York Police
Department is unacceptable.

1255
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:51,480
The white Mob takes money

1256
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:54,970
from the hardworking Negroes
of Harlem and put nothing back.

1257
01:04:54,970 --> 01:04:57,470
Meanwhile, the white
New York Police Department

1258
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,970
busts only the Negro numbers men

1259
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:02,440
in attempt to help
their white Mafia friends

1260
01:05:02,450 --> 01:05:04,460
keep their competition down.

1261
01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:06,300
Now, it's a damn shame
when the law

1262
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:08,780
discriminates in corruption,
don't you think?

1263
01:05:08,790 --> 01:05:10,290
I'm as comfortable with that

1264
01:05:10,290 --> 01:05:12,300
as I am with the Knights
of the Ku Klux Klan

1265
01:05:12,290 --> 01:05:14,290
working with Southern Democrats

1266
01:05:14,290 --> 01:05:16,290
to pass Negro civil rights
legislation.

1267
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:17,800
( murmuring )

1268
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:19,800
Although I'm sure that
my esteemed colleagues

1269
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:22,260
from the great South
would never participate

1270
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:26,730
with such a hateful, hurtful
band of cowardly thugs.

1271
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:30,590
( telephone ringing )

1272
01:05:30,590 --> 01:05:34,580
( ringing continues )

1273
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:36,580
Hello.

1274
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:37,580
MAN:
Hazel...

1275
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:41,080
tell your husband to do himself
and his family a favor

1276
01:05:41,090 --> 01:05:44,600
and keep his nose the hell out
of Harlem's numbers business.

1277
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:48,590
Who is this?

1278
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:50,600
I don't know what
you're talking about

1279
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:53,600
and I don't want you
to call here anymore.

1280
01:06:00,110 --> 01:06:04,620
( telephone rings )

1281
01:06:04,610 --> 01:06:07,810
( ringing continues )

1282
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:15,330
Thank God you're home.

1283
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:18,820
Baby, what's wrong?

1284
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:21,940
The phone's been
ringing all night.

1285
01:06:21,950 --> 01:06:22,950
Someone's threatening us.

1286
01:06:22,950 --> 01:06:24,950
I think it has to do
with that numbers thing.

1287
01:06:24,950 --> 01:06:26,450
( phone ringing )

1288
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:29,960
Can't we just go away,
me, you and Skipper?

1289
01:06:29,950 --> 01:06:32,950
This really scared me.

1290
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,460
Can't go fishing
on this one, baby.

1291
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:36,460
What exactly
did they say?

1292
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:38,970
What does the Mob
always say?

1293
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:42,440
If it's not one crisis, it's
another and another and another

1294
01:06:42,450 --> 01:06:45,960
and if there isn't one,
you create one.

1295
01:06:45,950 --> 01:06:48,950
Can't... can't you just let
this one go, please?

1296
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:51,460
This has nothing to do with you
getting ahead in Congress.

1297
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:53,950
It has everything to do
with my doing anything.

1298
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:56,440
I can't stand by and watch
my people get fleeced

1299
01:06:56,450 --> 01:06:58,440
by New York cops working
with New York mobsters.

1300
01:06:58,430 --> 01:07:00,430
Do you remember what
your father said about
trying to fight

1301
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:01,900
too many battles
on too many fronts?

1302
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:03,400
Don't quote my father to me.

1303
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:04,900
I know what my father said

1304
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:07,400
and I know what I got to do
to get where I'm going.

1305
01:07:07,410 --> 01:07:08,910
I was elected
to serve the people.

1306
01:07:08,910 --> 01:07:10,410
Baby, I got to
serve the people.

1307
01:07:10,410 --> 01:07:14,390
Maybe you should've
married the people.

1308
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:15,380
I did, baby.

1309
01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:18,850
Way before I met you.
I told you that.

1310
01:07:18,850 --> 01:07:20,850
I thought I made it
very clear.

1311
01:07:20,850 --> 01:07:24,340
It is very clear.

1312
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:29,340
I care for the people, too,
but I put my family first.

1313
01:07:29,350 --> 01:07:31,350
( telephone rings )

1314
01:07:50,370 --> 01:07:51,870
( telephone thuds )

1315
01:07:55,870 --> 01:07:58,350
I'm Lester Wolff
of Between the Lines,

1316
01:07:58,360 --> 01:07:59,860
and we have with us
the controversial

1317
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:02,370
outspoken Congressman
from Harlem,

1318
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:05,360
Congressman Adam
Clayton Powell, Jr.

1319
01:08:05,370 --> 01:08:07,870
We will speak with
Congressman Powell
about corruption

1320
01:08:07,870 --> 01:08:10,370
between the Mob and the
New York Police Department

1321
01:08:10,370 --> 01:08:13,380
the alleged politically-
motivated tax fraud charges

1322
01:08:13,370 --> 01:08:14,870
Congressman Powell faces

1323
01:08:14,870 --> 01:08:17,370
and death threats
from a misguided mobster.

1324
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:20,380
Welcome, Congressman Powell.

1325
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:21,890
You said on the floor
of Congress

1326
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:23,380
that there is
an alleged bagwoman.

1327
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:25,380
No, she's very real.

1328
01:08:25,390 --> 01:08:26,890
A woman who delivers
money payoffs

1329
01:08:26,890 --> 01:08:28,890
from the Mob to the police
named Esther James.

1330
01:08:28,890 --> 01:08:30,390
Is that correct?

1331
01:08:30,390 --> 01:08:32,400
Yes, and everyone in Harlem
knows it.

1332
01:08:32,390 --> 01:08:34,560
Adam Clayton Powell
said in a statement today

1333
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:36,370
that he refuses to pay
the civil judgment

1334
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:38,390
in the defamation lawsuit
brought against him,

1335
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:40,780
bringing the very real
possibility of his arrest.

1336
01:08:40,780 --> 01:08:42,860
This is a victory not just
for Adam Clayton Powell.

1337
01:08:42,870 --> 01:08:44,630
The victory bell
that you hear ringing

1338
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:46,620
is a victory for the people
of Harlem,

1339
01:08:46,620 --> 01:08:47,750
for the people of my district,

1340
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:50,880
for all throughout the Congress
of the United States of America.

1341
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,770
There will be no railroading
of Adam Clayton Powell

1342
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:54,260
in this instance.

1343
01:08:54,260 --> 01:08:55,760
I think it is not just
a victory for me,

1344
01:08:56,270 --> 01:08:58,140
it is a victory for you.

1345
01:08:58,130 --> 01:08:59,630
And please print
what I say, baby.

1346
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:02,640
I am saying exactly what
I mean and I mean what I say.

1347
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:05,130
MINISTER:
When the Lord said,
"Turn the other cheek"

1348
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:08,120
he didn't mean stick your face
out there and get knocked down.

1349
01:09:08,130 --> 01:09:10,130
Nothing wrong with rolling
with the punch.

1350
01:09:10,130 --> 01:09:12,620
The Lord wasn't a fool.

1351
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,500
Anything you want
is yours.

1352
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:37,860
No, it isn't.

1353
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:41,840
Why Paris?

1354
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:43,340
What the hell is in Paris?

1355
01:09:43,350 --> 01:09:44,850
Why not here in New York?

1356
01:09:44,850 --> 01:09:46,700
Because that's where
I want to go

1357
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:48,710
and that's what I want to do.

1358
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:52,700
You go where you want to go
and you do what you want to do.

1359
01:09:55,690 --> 01:09:58,690
I'm not usually at a loss
for words, but I...

1360
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:03,700
Thank you, Hazel,
for everything.

1361
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,200
"Thank you"?

1362
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:07,200
"Thank you," Adam?

1363
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:09,700
I'm not one of your colleagues.

1364
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:12,710
This is not some pleasant
political disagreement.

1365
01:10:12,710 --> 01:10:14,720
I am your wife and I'm angry.

1366
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:16,190
Will you...?

1367
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:29,250
I'm going to miss you, lady.

1368
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:31,240
I'm going to miss you bad.

1369
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:36,600
Well, I hope you get
your chairmanship
or your speakership

1370
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:39,110
or whatever the hell
it is you want

1371
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:42,320
before they get you.

1372
01:10:44,690 --> 01:10:46,690
I'm not so easy to get.

1373
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,220
Skipper.

1374
01:11:11,230 --> 01:11:12,730
You got to be a man now.

1375
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:14,740
Got to take care
of your mom and yourself.

1376
01:11:14,740 --> 01:11:17,750
You hear?

1377
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:19,740
I'll see you
in a little bit.

1378
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:22,240
Yes, sir.

1379
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:30,260
Remember, head up,
shoulders back

1380
01:11:30,250 --> 01:11:32,750
palms out.

1381
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:34,260
You're a Powell man.

1382
01:11:36,230 --> 01:11:38,230
Go on.

1383
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:25,950
I got some chores
to do around here.

1384
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:28,940
Want to earn your keep?

1385
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:31,950
Well, if you're willing
to keep answering questions.

1386
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:37,450
What are you
smiling about?

1387
01:12:37,450 --> 01:12:39,450
Talk is cheap.
You're a bargain.

1388
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:40,460
Let's get to work.

1389
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:41,460
Hold on.

1390
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:43,460
Let me ask you
a question.

1391
01:12:51,570 --> 01:12:56,080
So, after Eisenhower,
you supported Kennedy?

1392
01:12:56,070 --> 01:12:59,570
Didn't want to
particularly, right off.

1393
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:02,580
Nixon had the boy Kennedy
on my committee.

1394
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:06,590
He supported the
southern Dixiecrats
on most issues.

1395
01:13:06,580 --> 01:13:08,580
But, yeah,
I worked with him

1396
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:10,080
after the better man
at the time, Johnson,

1397
01:13:10,590 --> 01:13:11,590
didn't get
the nomination.

1398
01:13:12,910 --> 01:13:15,410
Now, Adam, I don't care
what presidential candidate

1399
01:13:15,410 --> 01:13:19,420
Symington and Kennedy
come around selling.

1400
01:13:19,410 --> 01:13:21,410
Lyndon here is going

1401
01:13:21,410 --> 01:13:24,410
to be the man
to beat.

1402
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:28,430
You just tell Speaker Sam
what you want for your backing.

1403
01:13:28,420 --> 01:13:29,420
He'll let you know

1404
01:13:29,420 --> 01:13:31,400
if it's possible.

1405
01:13:31,410 --> 01:13:33,910
My seniority protected
from the Dixiecrats

1406
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:34,920
and the Republicans.

1407
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:39,880
Done.

1408
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:41,360
And I want the chairmanship

1409
01:13:41,870 --> 01:13:43,870
of the Education
and Labor Committee.

1410
01:13:46,370 --> 01:13:48,840
You should

1411
01:13:49,330 --> 01:13:52,330
rightfully have
what is rightfully yours,

1412
01:13:52,330 --> 01:13:54,330
according to seniority.

1413
01:13:54,330 --> 01:13:55,840
I will support that fully.

1414
01:13:59,790 --> 01:14:02,290
Mr. Jones?

1415
01:14:02,290 --> 01:14:06,300
The best way
to go about this is quietly.

1416
01:14:06,290 --> 01:14:09,790
I will deliver on behalf
of Congressman Powell and myself

1417
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:11,300
at least half the delegate votes

1418
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:14,290
that Senator Johnson
will get on the first ballot.

1419
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:16,250
If he wins
the presidential nomination

1420
01:14:16,250 --> 01:14:18,750
we will throw our full support
behind him.

1421
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:19,750
If not,

1422
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:21,760
we must be free

1423
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:23,230
to do what's best for the party.

1424
01:14:23,230 --> 01:14:26,720
Your reputation is well earned,
Mr. Jones.

1425
01:14:26,710 --> 01:14:31,710
No matter who ends up being
the Democratic nominee,

1426
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:34,730
Congressman Powell will get

1427
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,180
full Democratic
support for the

1428
01:14:36,190 --> 01:14:37,190
Education and
Labor chairmanship

1429
01:14:37,190 --> 01:14:40,680
which he rightfully deserves.

1430
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:47,190
( chuckles )

1431
01:14:47,180 --> 01:14:48,180
Deal.

1432
01:14:50,190 --> 01:14:53,660
POWELL:
Through all the politicking
and backroom dealing,

1433
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:55,600
it ended up
JFK against Nixon,

1434
01:14:56,080 --> 01:15:00,030
but as I promised my father,
I had to remain independent.

1435
01:15:00,030 --> 01:15:01,440
Are you ready?

1436
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:03,930
I was born
ready, Ray.

1437
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,450
Bobby...
Ray.

1438
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:12,940
the Congressman
will see you.

1439
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:14,940
Bobby, baby.

1440
01:15:14,940 --> 01:15:17,440
Offer you a cigar?

1441
01:15:17,450 --> 01:15:18,450
Thanks.

1442
01:15:18,450 --> 01:15:19,950
Ray smoked half
my stash.

1443
01:15:19,950 --> 01:15:22,460
I'm going to give
it to him anyway.

1444
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:24,450
I think it's brilliant
what you boys are doing

1445
01:15:24,450 --> 01:15:25,450
with Jack's campaign.

1446
01:15:25,450 --> 01:15:27,450
Any chance of getting
Sinatra and Sammy up here

1447
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:28,960
to help me campaign
in Harlem?

1448
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:31,470
I'll see what I can do.

1449
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:34,460
Well, Bobby,
as we discussed earlier--

1450
01:15:34,460 --> 01:15:36,930
and Adam agrees
with me--

1451
01:15:36,930 --> 01:15:37,900
the only way we're going

1452
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:39,900
to get an Irish Catholic
into the White House

1453
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:41,900
is if the base of the Democratic
party comes together.

1454
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:46,890
That's right, but just one
question, Congressman.

1455
01:15:46,890 --> 01:15:48,890
Why did you ask
the other Negro delegates

1456
01:15:48,890 --> 01:15:50,390
not to support Jack
at the convention?

1457
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:51,890
Jack accepted the support

1458
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:55,380
of the segregationist Governor
John Patterson from Alabama.

1459
01:15:55,380 --> 01:15:57,860
He refused to vote

1460
01:15:57,870 --> 01:15:59,840
to censure Joe McCarthy,
he's got a lousy record

1461
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:01,330
on civil rights.

1462
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:04,810
Now you boys beat Lyndon Johnson
for the Democratic nomination,

1463
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:07,310
but there's no way you're going
to beat Nixon for the presidency

1464
01:16:07,310 --> 01:16:08,810
if I don't help, I guarantee it.

1465
01:16:08,810 --> 01:16:12,260
JONES:
So if we can work
something out,

1466
01:16:12,270 --> 01:16:15,240
maybe Jack can become president
after all.

1467
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:19,210
Well, that depends
on what you want, Congressman.

1468
01:16:19,210 --> 01:16:21,210
First topic is
the Education

1469
01:16:21,210 --> 01:16:23,220
and Labor Committee
chairmanship.

1470
01:16:23,210 --> 01:16:25,210
When I'm chair, I don't want
any interference

1471
01:16:25,210 --> 01:16:26,710
with my authority
or my seniority.

1472
01:16:27,220 --> 01:16:28,220
I want Jack
to back me.

1473
01:16:28,220 --> 01:16:29,690
And second, you and your brother

1474
01:16:29,690 --> 01:16:31,690
are going to have to change
your ways on civil rights

1475
01:16:31,690 --> 01:16:33,190
and the Negro.

1476
01:16:33,190 --> 01:16:34,700
JONES:
Well, Bobby?

1477
01:16:34,690 --> 01:16:35,650
What about it?

1478
01:16:35,660 --> 01:16:37,160
I don't know.

1479
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:39,670
I'll have to take that
back to Jack.

1480
01:16:39,660 --> 01:16:41,160
But I'll tell you one thing--

1481
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:43,160
Jack Kennedy will be
a lot better

1482
01:16:43,170 --> 01:16:45,670
for the Negro people than Nixon.

1483
01:16:45,670 --> 01:16:47,660
Well, he's got to get
elected first.

1484
01:16:47,650 --> 01:16:50,130
REPORTER:
Martin Luther King says
that neither Republicans

1485
01:16:50,140 --> 01:16:52,150
nor Democrats address
the needs of the Negro,

1486
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:55,140
and that his people must do
something to address this

1487
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:56,640
in the upcoming election.

1488
01:16:56,650 --> 01:16:59,150
Who is this
Southern Negro minister?

1489
01:16:59,150 --> 01:17:00,150
Thank you, darling.

1490
01:17:00,150 --> 01:17:02,660
Who gives Martin
Luther King the right

1491
01:17:02,650 --> 01:17:04,650
to speak for all Negroes?

1492
01:17:04,650 --> 01:17:06,650
This cat's trying
to take my job.

1493
01:17:06,660 --> 01:17:08,660
I just found out that
he and A. Philip Randolph

1494
01:17:08,660 --> 01:17:10,130
and Bayard Rustin plan
to protest

1495
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:11,630
both the Democratic
and Republican parties.

1496
01:17:11,630 --> 01:17:14,650
What?

1497
01:17:14,650 --> 01:17:17,120
No, I made a deal
with Bobby Kennedy
there weren't going

1498
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:18,570
to be any demonstrations
during the campaign.

1499
01:17:18,570 --> 01:17:22,080
I traded for power that's
going to benefit all Negroes,

1500
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:25,070
and now these bush leaguers
are going to mess it up?

1501
01:17:25,070 --> 01:17:27,540
You tell those amateurs
Adam Clayton Powell says,

1502
01:17:27,540 --> 01:17:29,040
"Call it off."

1503
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:31,010
Already put out that feeler.

1504
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:32,010
"No."

1505
01:17:32,010 --> 01:17:34,480
No?

1506
01:17:36,450 --> 01:17:40,070
You tell Martin Luther King
that if he doesn't call it off

1507
01:17:40,070 --> 01:17:41,570
I'm going to spread
the word

1508
01:17:42,070 --> 01:17:44,570
that his chief aide
Rustin is a homosexual.

1509
01:17:44,580 --> 01:17:45,580
Rustin's a homo, yeah?

1510
01:17:45,580 --> 01:17:49,590
Yes. He doesn't deny it.

1511
01:17:49,580 --> 01:17:51,080
You tell King
if he doesn't call it off

1512
01:17:51,570 --> 01:17:54,070
I'm going to tell the world
that he and his friend,

1513
01:17:54,070 --> 01:17:56,580
Bayard Rustin, are having
a homosexual affair.

1514
01:17:59,070 --> 01:18:00,540
You can't do that, Adam.

1515
01:18:00,540 --> 01:18:02,040
It isn't true.

1516
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:05,030
Neither is most of the stuff
out there about me

1517
01:18:05,030 --> 01:18:06,530
but I have to carry the weight.

1518
01:18:06,530 --> 01:18:09,530
I negotiated for power
that's going to benefit

1519
01:18:09,540 --> 01:18:12,040
all Negroes and I'm not going
to have that jeopardized

1520
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:13,040
by Martin Loser King

1521
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:14,030
or anybody else.

1522
01:18:14,020 --> 01:18:15,020
What is this?

1523
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:17,490
Demonstrations and marches?

1524
01:18:17,490 --> 01:18:18,970
I did that
20 years ago.

1525
01:18:18,980 --> 01:18:20,120
So you were shooting

1526
01:18:20,110 --> 01:18:23,110
for as high up as you could go
in government?

1527
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:24,120
No.

1528
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:25,590
I was shooting
for as much power

1529
01:18:25,580 --> 01:18:27,080
as I could gain in government

1530
01:18:27,090 --> 01:18:30,090
because that's how changes
are made in Washington.

1531
01:18:30,090 --> 01:18:31,600
Marching and protesting
eventually get

1532
01:18:31,590 --> 01:18:34,090
on people's nerves;
get very little done.

1533
01:18:34,090 --> 01:18:36,210
Get an education,
learn a profession,

1534
01:18:36,210 --> 01:18:37,710
go into business,
politics.

1535
01:18:37,710 --> 01:18:39,710
Go after the
real power, baby.

1536
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:06,250
Gentlemen, I've been waiting
for the last 15 minutes

1537
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:08,720
for all of you to arrive.

1538
01:19:08,730 --> 01:19:10,700
My expectations are simple:

1539
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:12,200
we don't come late.

1540
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:15,160
We work as long and as hard
as we have to get bills drafted

1541
01:19:15,150 --> 01:19:16,130
and passed,

1542
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:18,130
quickly.

1543
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:21,120
Now let's get to work.

1544
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:22,590
It is now 15 minutes after
the hour.

1545
01:19:23,090 --> 01:19:25,090
The meeting will officially
come to order.

1546
01:19:25,090 --> 01:19:26,960
I doubled everything
of my predecessor,

1547
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:27,960
Graham Barden,
and his staff.

1548
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:29,460
Give me that hammer,
young blood.

1549
01:19:29,470 --> 01:19:31,470
Graham Barden believed
the earth am flat

1550
01:19:31,470 --> 01:19:32,470
and the sun do move.

1551
01:19:32,470 --> 01:19:34,980
I doubled the meetings,
budget requests

1552
01:19:34,970 --> 01:19:36,970
and more than quadrupled
his results.

1553
01:19:36,970 --> 01:19:38,470
Come on, baby,
keep moving.

1554
01:19:38,470 --> 01:19:39,470
Time's a-wasting.

1555
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:41,980
In one 14-month period,
I was responsible

1556
01:19:41,980 --> 01:19:43,580
for the passage of 14 bills.

1557
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:45,090
Now, that is a record

1558
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:47,810
that no chairman in the history
of the United States Congress

1559
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:48,940
has before or since achieved.

1560
01:19:48,930 --> 01:19:50,430
In the six years
I was committee chairman,

1561
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:52,430
I never lost one bill once
it reached the House floor.

1562
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:55,400
That's why it was important
I keep getting reelected.

1563
01:19:55,890 --> 01:19:59,340
Congress operates by seniority,
relationships, experience.

1564
01:19:59,350 --> 01:20:00,830
It takes years
to acquire all three.

1565
01:20:00,830 --> 01:20:01,840
So the woman says

1566
01:20:01,830 --> 01:20:03,830
"I thought you were
a man of the cloth."

1567
01:20:03,830 --> 01:20:06,830
I said, "I am, baby. Silk."

1568
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:07,840
I'll see you fellas later.

1569
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:09,340
Thanks. I appreciate the vote.

1570
01:20:09,340 --> 01:20:11,810
Over time I was
able to maneuver
even my worst enemies.

1571
01:20:11,810 --> 01:20:14,820
I was most proud of
taking Congress to
the streets of Harlem.

and I will set you free ♪

1575
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:25,030

1576
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:27,040
The meeting will officially come
to order.

1577
01:20:27,540 --> 01:20:29,050
What got me was how, over time,

1578
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:32,040
eventually my most reluctant
colleagues learned to like it.

1579
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:34,910
This is America
for whom we serve!

1580
01:20:41,550 --> 01:20:45,050
REPORTER:
Over half a million people
were in attendance

1581
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:47,560
in this historic march
on Washington.

1582
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:50,070
Martin Luther King stirred
the passions of the crowd,

1583
01:20:50,060 --> 01:20:52,560
if not the nation,
with a rousing speech

1584
01:20:53,070 --> 01:20:55,570
about his dreams
of what America can be.

1585
01:20:55,570 --> 01:20:58,070
It is generally agreed
that King's words

1586
01:20:58,070 --> 01:21:00,580
made this a day that will
long be remembered.

1587
01:21:00,570 --> 01:21:04,490
And now we go to a live report
from the Washington Monument.

1588
01:21:04,490 --> 01:21:06,490
Martin Luther King
may have just made

1589
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:08,500
the speech
of the century.

1590
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:11,500
Anybody can have
a dream.

1591
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:12,510
The question is

1592
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:14,500
whether or not
you can turn

1593
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:16,500
that dream into
a reality.

1594
01:21:16,510 --> 01:21:20,000
Maybe we should have stayed
in the stands.

1595
01:21:19,990 --> 01:21:22,990
To do what, Ray?

1596
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Be part of the crowd?

1597
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,010
Part of King's audience?

1598
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:32,500
Man, that ought to be my show.

1599
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:35,000
My speech would have been
"I have a plan."

1600
01:21:36,510 --> 01:21:38,010
I can't believe
my good friend Martin

1601
01:21:38,010 --> 01:21:40,020
would have an event like this
in my town

1602
01:21:40,010 --> 01:21:41,010
and not invite me to speak.

1603
01:21:41,010 --> 01:21:43,230
You didn't exactly
endear yourself

1604
01:21:43,230 --> 01:21:44,730
with that homosexual ploy

1605
01:21:44,730 --> 01:21:46,700
between him
and Bayard.

1606
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:48,700
It's politics, Ray.

1607
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:50,200
Besides, he's a pacifist.

1608
01:21:50,210 --> 01:21:51,710
He turns the other cheek.

1609
01:21:51,710 --> 01:21:53,710
Let's white folks
slap him around.

1610
01:21:53,710 --> 01:21:56,220
He's supposed to be
above all that.

1611
01:21:58,960 --> 01:21:59,960
This is history, baby!

1612
01:21:59,970 --> 01:22:01,470
I ought to be right
in the center of it!

1613
01:22:03,450 --> 01:22:05,930
Would you invite you to speak
if you were him?

1614
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:10,920
Are you kidding? No way.

1615
01:22:10,930 --> 01:22:12,430
Besides, everybody knows

1616
01:22:12,430 --> 01:22:14,940
Powell would probably steal
the whole goddamn show.

1617
01:22:16,430 --> 01:22:20,300
Early '60s, in spite
of the schemes of
all my enemies

1618
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:22,300
things were
looking pretty good

1619
01:22:22,810 --> 01:22:24,790
for me to get things done.

1620
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:31,750
Jack Kennedy and I
became pretty close.

1621
01:22:31,750 --> 01:22:34,240
Ain't nothing jumpin'
but the peas in the pot

1622
01:22:34,230 --> 01:22:37,730
and they wouldn't be jumpin'
if the water wasn't hot.

1623
01:22:38,450 --> 01:22:39,320
Ow!

1624
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:40,820
( laughing )

1625
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:45,020
Finally won one, young blood.

1626
01:22:45,130 --> 01:22:46,130
That's right.

1627
01:22:46,130 --> 01:22:47,630
Changing of the guard.

1628
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:49,140
New blood on the block.

1629
01:22:54,070 --> 01:22:56,040
( clears throat )

1630
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:58,530
Um... you were saying

1631
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:00,500
about Jack Kennedy...?

1632
01:23:00,510 --> 01:23:05,020
I was saying Jack Kennedy and I
became very close.

1633
01:23:05,010 --> 01:23:07,510
He kept his word.

1634
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,510
I had full access
to the White House.

1635
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:12,500
I had his complete support.

1636
01:23:14,490 --> 01:23:16,500
About a year later,
it finally hit me.

1637
01:23:16,490 --> 01:23:18,990
I think I cried
for the better part of a night.

1638
01:23:18,990 --> 01:23:22,460
A lot of things have been said
about Jack Kennedy.

1639
01:23:22,460 --> 01:23:25,450
I wasn't always a fan, but...

1640
01:23:25,450 --> 01:23:26,950
The man I came to know

1641
01:23:26,950 --> 01:23:29,950
had the milk of human kindness
in his veins.

1642
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:31,490
In my opinion,
Kennedy's assassination

1643
01:23:31,490 --> 01:23:34,400
was the result of a conspiracy.

1644
01:23:34,390 --> 01:23:37,510
Oswald was a patsy.

1645
01:23:37,510 --> 01:23:39,580
I know there were unseen hands
planning the death

1646
01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:41,710
of King, Malcolm and Bobby,

1647
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:44,980
burning cities, riots
and chaos,

1648
01:23:44,990 --> 01:23:48,560
but, through it all,
I had to stay focused

1649
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:50,750
on what I was fighting against:

1650
01:23:51,190 --> 01:23:53,670
Inequality, injustice...

1651
01:23:54,180 --> 01:23:57,190
the trampling
of basic human civil rights.

1652
01:23:57,180 --> 01:23:58,680
Now, these are not the goals

1653
01:23:59,180 --> 01:24:00,680
set down
by the Founding Fathers

1654
01:24:00,690 --> 01:24:03,690
reaching for the best
of what was inside of them.

1655
01:24:03,690 --> 01:24:05,560
Lyndon Johnson
was a skilled ally.

1656
01:24:08,380 --> 01:24:10,180
PRESIDENT JOHNSON:
Dear Adam...

1657
01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:13,150
the fifth anniversary
of your chairmanship

1658
01:24:13,150 --> 01:24:16,070
of the House Education
and Labor Committee

1659
01:24:16,070 --> 01:24:19,080
reflects a brilliant record
of accomplishment.

1660
01:24:19,070 --> 01:24:22,570
It represents the successful
reporting to Congress

1661
01:24:22,570 --> 01:24:25,040
on 49 pieces
of bedrock legislation

1662
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:28,040
and the passage
of every one of these bills

1663
01:24:28,050 --> 01:24:31,050
attests to your ability
to get things done.

1664
01:24:31,050 --> 01:24:37,560
The poverty program is rapidly
paving new pathways to progress

1665
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:41,050
for those whom the economic
vitality of this land

1666
01:24:41,540 --> 01:24:42,940
had previously bypassed.

1667
01:24:42,950 --> 01:24:44,450
There's a glass; there you are.

1668
01:24:44,450 --> 01:24:45,950
The education measures

1669
01:24:45,950 --> 01:24:49,460
are being translated
into fuller opportunities

1670
01:24:49,450 --> 01:24:50,950
for all our citizens

1671
01:24:50,950 --> 01:24:53,420
to develop
their God-given talents

1672
01:24:53,420 --> 01:24:55,400
to their fullest potential.

1673
01:24:55,910 --> 01:24:57,910
Minimum wage-- long a guarantee

1674
01:24:57,910 --> 01:25:01,320
of a fair return
for an honest day's work--

1675
01:25:01,310 --> 01:25:04,790
has been increased
and greatly extended,

1676
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:09,810
and the problems of juvenile
delinquency are being met

1677
01:25:09,810 --> 01:25:13,550
and curtailed by positive
and determined action.

1678
01:25:13,540 --> 01:25:16,040
Only with progressive
leadership

1679
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:20,540
could so much have been
accomplished by one committee

1680
01:25:20,550 --> 01:25:22,060
in so short a time.

1681
01:25:22,050 --> 01:25:24,550
I speak for millions
of Americans

1682
01:25:24,550 --> 01:25:26,080
who benefit from these laws

1683
01:25:26,090 --> 01:25:30,500
when I say I am truly grateful.

1684
01:25:30,490 --> 01:25:35,490
Sincerely yours,
Lyndon B. Johnson.

1685
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:38,100
Even though you were
such a good chairman

1686
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:39,610
they still
went after you?

1687
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:41,100
Think, young blood.

1688
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:42,600
It was precisely
because I was

1689
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:44,100
an active and
successful chairman

1690
01:25:44,110 --> 01:25:45,610
that the enemies
of civil rights

1691
01:25:45,610 --> 01:25:47,610
and progressive
government came
after me.

1692
01:25:47,610 --> 01:25:50,620
If I'd done nothing
and spoke softly,

1693
01:25:50,610 --> 01:25:52,610
they would've
left me alone.

1694
01:25:52,980 --> 01:25:55,380
CONGRESSMAN:
He considers himself
above the law

1695
01:25:55,380 --> 01:25:57,780
and above the
House of Representatives.

1696
01:25:57,790 --> 01:26:00,090
And I guess he was down
in Bimini, as I stated,

1697
01:26:00,090 --> 01:26:02,100
he was down there
with a glass in one hand

1698
01:26:02,090 --> 01:26:03,290
and a woman in the other hand,

1699
01:26:03,290 --> 01:26:05,290
and I don't think
it's incumbent upon us

1700
01:26:05,290 --> 01:26:06,890
as responsible members
of the House

1701
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:10,100
to belabor ourself with a man
with an attitude such as that.

1702
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:14,510
He has demonstrated over
and over again, in my judgment,

1703
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:18,100
that he is not a suitable person
to participate

1704
01:26:18,110 --> 01:26:22,520
in enacting laws to govern
the people of this country.

1705
01:26:22,810 --> 01:26:24,810
Adam Powell is a symbol

1706
01:26:24,810 --> 01:26:28,410
that all black people
can organize around!

1707
01:26:28,420 --> 01:26:30,820
( cheering and applause )

1708
01:26:30,820 --> 01:26:35,630
There is no black man in America
bigger than Adam Clayton Powell.

1709
01:26:35,620 --> 01:26:39,220
( cheering )

1710
01:26:39,230 --> 01:26:41,330
( chanting ):
We want Powell! Now!

1711
01:26:41,330 --> 01:26:42,640
Back in the chair! Right now!

1712
01:26:42,630 --> 01:26:44,230
We want Powell!

1713
01:26:44,330 --> 01:26:45,530
Back in the chair!

1714
01:26:45,530 --> 01:26:46,730
POWELL:
The Celler Committee

1715
01:26:47,140 --> 01:26:49,340
during their so-called
investigation of me

1716
01:26:49,340 --> 01:26:52,350
even dragged my third wife
Yvette in front of them.

1717
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:54,340
I know this committee
wants to be fair

1718
01:26:54,740 --> 01:26:57,840
and I hope its report will be
favorable to my husband.

1719
01:26:57,850 --> 01:26:59,750
Miss Scott,
you recently got back

1720
01:26:59,750 --> 01:27:02,760
from a concert tour
of Europe and the Middle East.

1721
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:04,250
How long have you
been back now?

1722
01:27:04,250 --> 01:27:07,250
Yes, uh, altogether,
just about six months.

1723
01:27:07,260 --> 01:27:09,760
Six months-- so you've obviously
been back long enough

1724
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:11,260
to have heard about
the difficulties

1725
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:13,270
that your ex-husband,
Congressman Powell

1726
01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:15,260
has been going through.
How do you feel about that?

1727
01:27:15,260 --> 01:27:17,760
Well, I think it's
eminently unfair

1728
01:27:17,770 --> 01:27:20,270
what's happening
to him, I really do

1729
01:27:20,270 --> 01:27:23,280
the fact that
he's been charged
for something

1730
01:27:23,270 --> 01:27:26,270
that other congressmen
consider everyday
occurrences.

1731
01:27:26,780 --> 01:27:30,270
As a matter of fact,
in a Life magazine article

1732
01:27:30,260 --> 01:27:31,760
which I read last week

1733
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:33,730
where this Congressman Hays

1734
01:27:33,730 --> 01:27:36,730
was a chairman
of a special subcommittee

1735
01:27:36,740 --> 01:27:39,740
to investigate Federal
printing and paperwork,

1736
01:27:39,740 --> 01:27:42,250
and between May and June
of 1958,

1737
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:46,240
Congressman Hays took 52 trips

1738
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:49,240
that cost over $1,000 each

1739
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:53,260
out of funds allocated
by Congress for NATO.

1740
01:27:53,250 --> 01:27:55,750
I gather you're quite angry
about that.

1741
01:27:55,750 --> 01:27:57,730
I have to ask you this:

1742
01:27:57,740 --> 01:28:01,250
what is your evaluation
of him as a Congressman?

1743
01:28:01,740 --> 01:28:05,730
I'm just a private citizen,
so my evaluation doesn't matter.

1744
01:28:05,730 --> 01:28:10,200
But let's ask Lyndon Johnson
for his evaluation of him;

1745
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:14,200
late President Kennedy
what his evaluation of his...

1746
01:28:14,210 --> 01:28:16,710
uh, Speaker John McCormack--

1747
01:28:16,710 --> 01:28:19,720
they said that he was
the best chairman on the Hill

1748
01:28:20,210 --> 01:28:22,710
and that's good enough for me.

1749
01:28:22,710 --> 01:28:24,210
You know,
I can't help noticing

1750
01:28:24,220 --> 01:28:26,720
you speak about
Congressman Powell,
your ex-husband

1751
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:28,220
with such affection
and loyalty.

1752
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:30,230
I have to ask this:
is there any chance

1753
01:28:30,220 --> 01:28:32,220
that you two might
get back together again?

1754
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:34,200
Oh, no.

1755
01:28:34,210 --> 01:28:35,720
No, no.

1756
01:28:35,710 --> 01:28:37,710
We are friends;
we remain friends

1757
01:28:38,210 --> 01:28:41,210
and we have a son together
who we're very proud of,

1758
01:28:41,220 --> 01:28:43,660
but no, not at all.

1759
01:28:44,350 --> 01:28:46,350
Mr. Speaker.

1760
01:28:46,350 --> 01:28:47,850
You know,
the number of congressmen

1761
01:28:47,860 --> 01:28:51,360
who want to deny Adam Clayton
Powell his seat in Congress

1762
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:54,370
is no longer a few good ol'
boys in backroom card games.

1763
01:28:54,360 --> 01:28:56,360
It's becoming a crusade.

1764
01:28:56,360 --> 01:28:57,360
Mm-hmm.

1765
01:28:57,370 --> 01:28:59,370
And I been thinking:

1766
01:28:59,370 --> 01:29:02,380
if we were to strip him
of his chairmanship

1767
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:04,370
in Education and Labor--

1768
01:29:04,370 --> 01:29:07,370
which essentially
reduces him to nothing--

1769
01:29:07,380 --> 01:29:09,880
this might satisfy
the Republicans

1770
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:11,880
the Southern Democrats

1771
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:14,120
and the others that want
to run him out of Congress.

1772
01:29:14,120 --> 01:29:16,620
I'm not sure
that'll be enough, John.

1773
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:18,240
Well, for heaven's sakes,

1774
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:19,740
if you strip a man
of all his power,

1775
01:29:19,740 --> 01:29:21,240
what else could
they possibly want?

1776
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:24,230
Well, there is one thing
he could give his colleagues

1777
01:29:24,230 --> 01:29:26,230
that might help--

1778
01:29:26,230 --> 01:29:28,740
something that none of us
have ever seen before.

1779
01:29:28,730 --> 01:29:31,230
What could that be?

1780
01:29:31,230 --> 01:29:32,710
Humility.

1781
01:29:32,720 --> 01:29:33,720
( chuckles )

1782
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:36,190
( bells tolling outside )

1783
01:29:36,190 --> 01:29:38,190
Adam...

1784
01:29:38,190 --> 01:29:41,160
J. Raymond Jones.

1785
01:29:46,630 --> 01:29:49,130
What can I do for you?

1786
01:29:49,130 --> 01:29:51,610
I need to talk to you.

1787
01:29:51,620 --> 01:29:53,130
Please sit down.

1788
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:08,600
I'm not here for me, Adam.

1789
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:13,100
King, Randolph, Farmer,

1790
01:30:13,610 --> 01:30:16,120
every black leader,
every black newspaper,

1791
01:30:16,110 --> 01:30:21,110
every black person, is doing
everything they can to help you,

1792
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:23,120
but you have to help yourself.

1793
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:26,130
When have you known me not to?

1794
01:30:28,110 --> 01:30:32,120
All who see this are agreed that
you've written a great speech.

1795
01:30:32,110 --> 01:30:34,110
The tone is right.

1796
01:30:34,110 --> 01:30:36,060
Contrite?

1797
01:30:36,060 --> 01:30:37,680
Diplomatic.

1798
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:40,680
There's a lot more at stake
than your pride, Adam.

1799
01:30:40,690 --> 01:30:42,190
You owe the people

1800
01:30:42,190 --> 01:30:43,180
who put you here.

1801
01:30:43,170 --> 01:30:46,170
I'll be the judge
of who I owe and what.

1802
01:30:46,170 --> 01:30:48,170
I've made it my point to study

1803
01:30:48,180 --> 01:30:49,920
those men out there,
my fellow congressmen,

1804
01:30:49,910 --> 01:30:51,410
who now sit in
judgment of me,

1805
01:30:51,410 --> 01:30:54,390
and if all the lying, shameless
hypocrites were to leave,

1806
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:57,410
there wouldn't be enough men
left in that room to vote.

1807
01:30:58,900 --> 01:31:00,400
You still have to give
the speech.

1808
01:31:00,410 --> 01:31:02,410
I don't have to do a damn thing

1809
01:31:02,410 --> 01:31:03,910
except for stay black and die.

1810
01:31:03,910 --> 01:31:06,400
Adam, please.

1811
01:31:06,390 --> 01:31:08,390
Sit down.

1812
01:31:25,850 --> 01:31:28,860
You're one of the most powerful
black men of this century

1813
01:31:28,850 --> 01:31:30,850
maybe the most ever

1814
01:31:30,850 --> 01:31:33,330
and I know you like

1815
01:31:33,590 --> 01:31:36,080
the distinction

1816
01:31:36,070 --> 01:31:38,070
but if you don't do this,
100 years from now

1817
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:40,080
most people
are not going to know

1818
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:41,950
who you are.
But I will.

1819
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:45,190
Save that for
the lecture circuit, Adam.

1820
01:31:45,180 --> 01:31:47,180
I know better.

1821
01:31:47,190 --> 01:31:48,690
You can't have it all
this time!

1822
01:31:49,190 --> 01:31:51,690
And I don't care
how many congressional
hypocrites you can point to

1823
01:31:51,690 --> 01:31:53,700
who have done
the same or worse

1824
01:31:53,690 --> 01:31:55,560
you bet your career
on righteous indignation

1825
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:57,560
and you're going to lose.

1826
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:15,140
McCORMACK:
The Speaker at this time
would like to acknowledge

1827
01:32:15,150 --> 01:32:18,750
the Representative
from New York, Emmanuel Celler

1828
01:32:18,750 --> 01:32:22,260
who has been chairing
the bipartisan committee

1829
01:32:22,250 --> 01:32:25,250
which was investigating
the allegations

1830
01:32:25,260 --> 01:32:27,760
against Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.

1831
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:29,270
and they, at this time,

1832
01:32:29,260 --> 01:32:32,260
are ready to make their
recommendations to the House.

1833
01:32:32,260 --> 01:32:34,260
Mr. Celler.

1834
01:32:34,770 --> 01:32:37,770
Thank you,
Mr. Speaker.

1835
01:32:37,770 --> 01:32:41,390
Except for three instances
of treason,

1836
01:32:41,390 --> 01:32:44,400
and that was
during the Civil War,

1837
01:32:44,390 --> 01:32:49,390
resolutions of expulsion
either failed to receive

1838
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:52,910
the necessary two-thirds vote
or lost,

1839
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:58,900
and a resolution of censure
was substituted and approved.

1840
01:32:58,910 --> 01:33:00,910
Mr. Powell's wrongdoing

1841
01:33:00,910 --> 01:33:06,920
does not rise to the heights
of malevolence such as treason.

1842
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:11,410
This bipartisan committee
recommends:

1843
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:14,370
First, that the duly elected
Mr. Powell

1844
01:33:14,370 --> 01:33:17,370
be administered
the oath of office.

1845
01:33:17,380 --> 01:33:18,380
( murmurs of approval )

1846
01:33:18,380 --> 01:33:23,390
Second, that Adam Clayton
Powell be publicly censured

1847
01:33:23,380 --> 01:33:26,880
by the Speaker
in the name of the House.

1848
01:33:26,890 --> 01:33:32,410
Third, that Adam Clayton Powell
pay the Clerk of the House

1849
01:33:32,410 --> 01:33:38,380
$40,000 to offset
his civil liabilities.

1850
01:33:38,380 --> 01:33:39,350
Thank you.

1851
01:33:39,850 --> 01:33:40,850
( clamoring )

1852
01:33:40,850 --> 01:33:42,360
( gavel pounding )

1853
01:33:42,350 --> 01:33:47,850
The Speaker recognizes the
gentleman from Iowa, Mr. Gross.

1854
01:33:47,860 --> 01:33:51,350
Mr. Speaker, I have
a reasonably strong stomach

1855
01:33:51,340 --> 01:33:55,340
but it will revolt at the aroma
that will arise in this chamber

1856
01:33:55,350 --> 01:33:58,840
if today, Adam Clayton Powell
is offered a seat

1857
01:33:58,830 --> 01:33:59,800
in this chamber!

1858
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:01,300
Hear! Hear! Mr. Speaker!

1859
01:34:01,300 --> 01:34:02,300
( gavel pounding )

1860
01:34:02,300 --> 01:34:07,300
The Speaker recognizes from Ohio
the gentleman, Mr. Devine.

1861
01:34:07,310 --> 01:34:09,320
Censure is sufficient
humiliation?

1862
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:12,290
Who are we kidding?

1863
01:34:12,300 --> 01:34:13,800
Humility does not appear

1864
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:15,810
to be one
of the gentleman's virtues.

1865
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:17,530
( congressional members
murmuring )

1866
01:34:17,540 --> 01:34:19,040
( gavel pounding )

1867
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:21,540
The Speaker recognizes Mr. Hall,
the gentleman from Missouri.

1868
01:34:21,540 --> 01:34:25,530
Mr. Speaker,
Powell is uncensurable

1869
01:34:26,030 --> 01:34:27,530
unembarrassable

1870
01:34:27,530 --> 01:34:30,040
and irresponsible.

1871
01:34:30,030 --> 01:34:30,990
Thank you.

1872
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,000
MAN:
Yes! Yes!

1873
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,010
Mr. Speaker!

1874
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:36,970
The Speaker acknowledges
from West Virginia

1875
01:34:36,970 --> 01:34:38,970
the gentleman, Mr. Moore.

1876
01:34:38,970 --> 01:34:43,470
My fellow Congressmen, if we
reject the recommendation

1877
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:47,990
that the committee you appointed
has so carefully delivered

1878
01:34:47,980 --> 01:34:50,960
we will all be
on a collision course

1879
01:34:50,970 --> 01:34:53,480
with the courts of this land.

1880
01:34:53,470 --> 01:34:54,470
Hear! Hear!

1881
01:34:54,470 --> 01:34:56,470
( gavel pounding )

1882
01:34:56,470 --> 01:34:57,970
( scattered applause )

1883
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:02,990
The Speaker at this time
would like to acknowledge

1884
01:35:02,980 --> 01:35:06,200
the presence of Adam Clayton
Powell, Jr. of New York

1885
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:09,700
in the House, and I call him
forward to speak to the House.

1886
01:35:09,700 --> 01:35:12,700
( congressional members
murmuring )

1887
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:23,210
( scattered applause )

1888
01:35:25,700 --> 01:35:27,570
Mr. Speaker...

1889
01:35:27,570 --> 01:35:29,570
my esteemed colleagues...

1890
01:35:29,570 --> 01:35:33,070
everyone here in Congress knows
that there are many among us

1891
01:35:33,580 --> 01:35:36,590
who have done far, far worse
than that which I am accused of.

1892
01:35:36,580 --> 01:35:41,310
Some of the truly guilty
have spoken out against me.

1893
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:42,320
There is no one here

1894
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:44,830
who does not have skeletons
in his closet

1895
01:35:44,820 --> 01:35:47,340
and I know
who owns what skeletons.

1896
01:35:47,340 --> 01:35:51,220
( congressional members
murmuring )

1897
01:35:51,230 --> 01:35:52,720
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

1898
01:35:55,680 --> 01:35:56,910
MAN:
Mr. Speaker!

1899
01:35:56,920 --> 01:35:58,420
( gavel pounding )

1900
01:35:58,420 --> 01:36:00,280
Mr. Speaker!

1901
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:02,880
The Speaker acknowledges
the gentleman

1902
01:36:02,870 --> 01:36:04,870
from California,
Mr. Van Deerlin.

1903
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:08,370
Mr. Speaker,
the unbelievable arrogance

1904
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:13,360
that has just been demonstrated
by Mr. Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.

1905
01:36:13,870 --> 01:36:17,380
without a single regret
expressed, no apologies,

1906
01:36:17,870 --> 01:36:22,370
calls for a motion on this floor
that this gentleman

1907
01:36:22,380 --> 01:36:24,350
be expelled from this House

1908
01:36:24,350 --> 01:36:28,350
and a special election called
for his replacement.

1909
01:36:28,350 --> 01:36:29,820
MAN:
Absolutely.

1910
01:36:29,820 --> 01:36:32,440
Mr. Speaker
I gladly second that motion.

1911
01:36:32,440 --> 01:36:34,860
SPEAKER:
The results of the resolution

1912
01:36:34,860 --> 01:36:39,370
to exclude Adam Clayton Powell
from this House are

1913
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:41,860
yeas: 248

1914
01:36:41,860 --> 01:36:44,330
nays: 176

1915
01:36:44,330 --> 01:36:48,330
zero abstentions.

1916
01:36:48,340 --> 01:36:51,310
Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.
of New York

1917
01:36:51,310 --> 01:36:55,820
is excluded from this,
the 90th Congress.

1918
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:58,310
( gavel pounding )

1919
01:36:58,310 --> 01:37:01,310
What are you
going to do, Adam?

1920
01:37:01,320 --> 01:37:07,330
Kunstler, Reid, Reeves,
Kinoy, Carter, Delaney

1921
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:09,820
Covington, the two Williamses,
Henry and Bennet

1922
01:37:09,820 --> 01:37:11,320
they're all on the way over.

1923
01:37:11,330 --> 01:37:13,330
I think I've got
enough lawyers.

1924
01:37:13,330 --> 01:37:15,840
I'm going to take this
miscarriage of justice

1925
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:16,830
to the Supreme Court.

1926
01:37:17,330 --> 01:37:18,330
But in the meantime?

1927
01:37:18,830 --> 01:37:21,330
Well, they're going to hold
a special election

1928
01:37:21,340 --> 01:37:22,340
in Harlem to replace me.

1929
01:37:22,340 --> 01:37:24,840
I'm going to win it
by a landslide

1930
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:27,810
while I'm fishing
down in Bimini.

1931
01:37:28,930 --> 01:37:31,930
The irony of it
is, is that Wayne Hays,
of the Hays Committee

1932
01:37:31,930 --> 01:37:34,440
who led the charge
I misused funds--

1933
01:37:34,430 --> 01:37:35,930
one of the two main charges

1934
01:37:35,930 --> 01:37:37,930
they booted me out
of Congress for--

1935
01:37:37,940 --> 01:37:39,940
was himself the center
of a White House scandal

1936
01:37:39,940 --> 01:37:42,440
because he took a House
headwaiter on a junket to Paris.

1937
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:43,950
Adam, you were guilty.

1938
01:37:43,940 --> 01:37:46,420
I mean, you did do the things
they accused you of.

1939
01:37:46,430 --> 01:37:48,430
You did use travel vouchers
improperly.

1940
01:37:48,430 --> 01:37:50,440
You did have relatives
on the payroll

1941
01:37:50,430 --> 01:37:52,430
and you did not settle
the libel suit

1942
01:37:52,430 --> 01:37:54,430
brought against you
by Esther James

1943
01:37:54,440 --> 01:37:56,440
for calling her a "bagwoman"

1944
01:37:56,440 --> 01:37:57,930
in public.

1945
01:37:57,920 --> 01:37:59,420
Well, she was, damn it!

1946
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:06,040
You can't count that
as a reason to boot me out.

1947
01:38:06,050 --> 01:38:09,540
That only shows how desperate
they were to get me.

1948
01:38:10,030 --> 01:38:12,030
And it's not illegal

1949
01:38:12,040 --> 01:38:15,510
or improper for congressmen
to have relatives on the payroll

1950
01:38:16,010 --> 01:38:17,010
if they're working.

1951
01:38:17,010 --> 01:38:19,010
And on the "misuse
of funds charge"

1952
01:38:19,010 --> 01:38:22,020
now, when I was asked
to appear before
the Hays Committee

1953
01:38:22,010 --> 01:38:24,010
I stipulated
I would only do so

1954
01:38:24,020 --> 01:38:26,020
if I were allowed
to cross-examine witnesses

1955
01:38:26,020 --> 01:38:27,520
including congressmen--

1956
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:30,140
the basic right of
the American judicial system--

1957
01:38:30,370 --> 01:38:33,350
but my fellow congressmen...

1958
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:35,360
they knew if I were
allowed to question them

1959
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:37,370
we could easily wind up
drawing lots to see

1960
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:39,860
who was the guilty congressman
who ought to be punished.

1961
01:38:39,860 --> 01:38:43,860
Everybody had some so-called
"questionable" travel items.

1962
01:38:43,870 --> 01:38:45,760
I know I was far
from the worst.

1963
01:38:46,250 --> 01:38:48,370
Hell, I could ask Hays
himself who it was

1964
01:38:48,370 --> 01:38:50,370
that paid
for the almost 50 trips

1965
01:38:50,370 --> 01:38:52,370
between Washington
and his home in Ohio.

1966
01:38:52,380 --> 01:38:55,380
But, still, man, you took
yourself out of the game.

1967
01:38:55,380 --> 01:38:58,390
Leaders have to
conduct themselves in a way

1968
01:38:58,380 --> 01:39:00,380
in which they don't get busted.

1969
01:39:00,380 --> 01:39:02,380
Leaders have to live, too,
young blood.

1970
01:39:02,390 --> 01:39:05,390
Leaders have to make mistakes.

1971
01:39:05,890 --> 01:39:07,400
And when you're more mature,

1972
01:39:07,390 --> 01:39:09,270
you will know that's one
of the most important

1973
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:10,730
parts about being honest
about who you are.

1974
01:39:10,730 --> 01:39:12,230
Naw, man.

1975
01:39:12,230 --> 01:39:15,220
You have to hold yourself
to a higher standard,

1976
01:39:15,220 --> 01:39:16,720
'cause when you mess up,

1977
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:19,730
you mess up everybody
who was counting on you.

1978
01:40:13,110 --> 01:40:15,110
I found this laying
around the house.

1979
01:40:15,110 --> 01:40:17,620
You might get some
mileage out of it.

1980
01:40:17,610 --> 01:40:19,110
Thank you.

1981
01:40:31,110 --> 01:40:33,600
You know, if you were
a better fisherman

1982
01:40:33,590 --> 01:40:35,090
we might have had some fun.

1983
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:46,050
It's getting a little late.

1984
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:49,040
Aren't you concerned about
those Duke Ellington eyes?

1985
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:51,520
No.

1986
01:40:52,030 --> 01:40:56,040
Not as much as I used to be.

1987
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:01,480
You'd better get off
this island, Adam.

1988
01:41:01,490 --> 01:41:04,000
Catch up with the times.

1989
01:41:03,990 --> 01:41:06,990
You're wrong again, kid.

1990
01:41:06,990 --> 01:41:09,980
It's the times that need
to catch up to me.

1991
01:41:15,450 --> 01:41:17,450
What time's your
plane tomorrow?

1992
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:21,960
My plane leaves at noon.

1993
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:26,460
Well, I'll see you
in the morning.

1994
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:41,660
Sweet dreams, kid.

1995
01:41:57,550 --> 01:41:59,550
( knocking )

1996
01:42:02,550 --> 01:42:04,560
Hey, wake up.

1997
01:42:04,550 --> 01:42:06,050
What?

1998
01:42:06,050 --> 01:42:08,050
We're here to see
Congressmen Powell.

1999
01:42:08,060 --> 01:42:10,550
Who are you?

2000
01:42:10,540 --> 01:42:12,290
We're newspaper reporters.

2001
01:42:12,790 --> 01:42:13,890
So?

2002
01:42:13,890 --> 01:42:16,390
We're here to get
Congressman Powell's

2003
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:18,400
reaction to the
Supreme Court ruling.

2004
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:20,410
What did they rule?

2005
01:42:22,140 --> 01:42:24,140
He won.

2006
01:42:26,620 --> 01:42:28,120
That's right.

2007
01:42:28,130 --> 01:42:30,630
He won.

2008
01:42:30,630 --> 01:42:32,620
He won.

2009
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:35,120
( whistles )

2010
01:42:35,120 --> 01:42:36,120
Mr. Powell!

2011
01:42:36,120 --> 01:42:37,640
Sir...

2012
01:42:37,640 --> 01:42:39,610
Hey, there he is!

2013
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:41,080
Mr. Powell...

2014
01:42:41,090 --> 01:42:42,090
Adam...

2015
01:42:42,090 --> 01:42:44,460
Do you have a quote
for the press, sir?

2016
01:42:44,460 --> 01:42:46,330
Adam!

2017
01:42:46,330 --> 01:42:48,580
Could we get a statement,
please, sir?

2018
01:42:48,580 --> 01:42:50,590
Right.

2019
01:42:50,580 --> 01:42:54,080
Sir, what's your reaction
to the Supreme Court's decision?

2020
01:42:54,090 --> 01:42:57,310
Two things happened today:
One, I was vindicated,

2021
01:42:57,300 --> 01:42:59,770
but more importantly,
this decision proves

2022
01:42:59,770 --> 01:43:02,250
that there is still justice
in the United States.

2023
01:43:02,260 --> 01:43:03,750
REPORTER:
What about your
salary and fines?

2024
01:43:03,740 --> 01:43:05,240
That came to
how much, sir?

2025
01:43:05,250 --> 01:43:07,740
$80,000 or
thereabouts.

2026
01:43:07,730 --> 01:43:09,210
Well, if they wrongly
took away my seat

2027
01:43:09,220 --> 01:43:10,720
I think it only
stands to reason

2028
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:13,230
they wrongly took
away my salary,
wouldn't you say?

2029
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:15,220
What about your seat
and seniority?

2030
01:43:15,220 --> 01:43:17,220
I think they should
give that back, too.

2031
01:43:17,220 --> 01:43:19,720
Believe me, my lawyers
will be making every effort

2032
01:43:19,730 --> 01:43:22,070
to see that these
issues are resolved.

2033
01:43:22,060 --> 01:43:24,060
REPORTER:
Do you harbor
any ill feelings?

2034
01:43:24,070 --> 01:43:24,690
No.

2035
01:43:24,680 --> 01:43:28,550
No, dear boy,
of course not.

2036
01:43:28,550 --> 01:43:30,670
Life is too short for that.

2037
01:43:32,540 --> 01:43:33,900
I pray each and every night

2038
01:43:33,890 --> 01:43:35,890
for those shameless hypocrites
who took away my seat.

2039
01:43:35,890 --> 01:43:40,310
SCHILLER:
That was the last I saw
of Adam Clayton Powell.

2040
01:43:40,310 --> 01:43:44,180
Someone told me that
if you look closely,

2041
01:43:44,690 --> 01:43:47,190
you can see death
on a man's face.

2042
01:43:47,190 --> 01:43:48,690
I went down to Bimini

2043
01:43:48,690 --> 01:43:51,700
and saw a great man dying
and didn't know it.

2044
01:43:51,690 --> 01:43:55,060
I think of all those nights
I was there

2045
01:43:55,060 --> 01:43:58,530
and all the questions
I should have asked but didn't.

2046
01:43:58,530 --> 01:44:02,510
Now I never can.

2047
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:05,490
And just like he said he would

2048
01:44:05,490 --> 01:44:08,000
Adam was reelected
by the people of Harlem

2049
01:44:07,990 --> 01:44:10,490
while he was in Bimini.

2050
01:44:10,490 --> 01:44:12,490
He served again in Congress

2051
01:44:12,500 --> 01:44:16,510
and even though he was
vindicated by the Supreme Court

2052
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:21,000
he never got back his seniority,
his money nor his chairmanship.

2053
01:44:21,010 --> 01:44:24,910
Someone ransacked his home
the night after he died.

2054
01:44:24,910 --> 01:44:27,320
The textbook he was working on,
along with his journals

2055
01:44:27,310 --> 01:44:29,210
writings and the gold medallion

2056
01:44:29,210 --> 01:44:33,100
bestowed upon him
by Haile Selassie disappeared.

2057
01:44:33,100 --> 01:44:35,100
I finished the story.

2058
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:36,600
Did I get it right?

2059
01:44:36,600 --> 01:44:37,600
I don't know.

2060
01:44:37,610 --> 01:44:41,480
All I can think is
what Adam would have said.

2061
01:44:41,480 --> 01:44:43,980
Keep the faith, baby.
