1
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:35,950
We're the sexiest couple of
girls in the western hemisphere

2
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:41,035
I'm Tina, the one with short hair.
She's Gina, but she's not Italian

3
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,997
I'm more mature but much
more sexy

4
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,548
We're two strippers and anything
else you can easily imagine

5
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,875
But we have a
secret side as well

6
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,349
We are Red Silk...

7
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,870
Very efficient private eyes,

8
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,077
Threats, blackmail or
whatever the problem may be...

9
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,994
...you just need put your ad:
''I'd buy Red Silk" and your...

10
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,513
...phone number in the classified
section of you daily newspaper

11
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,875
Then, we will contact you...

12
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,039
...and for a reasonable price,
we'll solve your problem

13
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,555
Of course, we also offer
some personal services,

14
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:49,428
but these are not included
in the price

15
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:54,835
We are the perfect couple,
don't you think so?

16
00:04:56,799 --> 00:05:00,394
As you can see, I am the brain
and Gina, the action

17
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,075
She's pretty kamikaze
and she always goes for it

18
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:09,073
Normally, we met our
clients here in the club

19
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,511
Here we could stimulate
our customers...

20
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:19,757
...and open they way to
their pockets

21
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,873
A friend of us, of the Paraiso,
a sweet drag queen, taught us this

22
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,676
...dance, the only we can do, as
you can see, not very well. Who cares?

23
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,954
He also gave us our name:
"Red Silk"

24
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:37,990
And you'll see why

25
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,275
We like to do it because we
are natural born exhibitionists

26
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,710
The night the story begins...

27
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,990
...our audience was small
and normal

28
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,152
The most interesting of them
was the millionaire Shiron Kalman

29
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,829
Surrounded as well by poor
kids and sinister bodyguards

30
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:21,353
He's never tried to seduce us but
he always stared at us with a hard look

31
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,397
We were some sort of
sexual stimulation for him

32
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,239
Come on, Silvia, take it easy,
I'll talk to them

33
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,348
- Mr. Kalman is calling you
- Leave me alone!

34
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,913
See what people ask for!

35
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,678
Christ, anything goes!

36
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,635
We've got a customer

38
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,791
Are you looking for Red Silk?

39
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,758
- He sounds very young
- Make an appointment

40
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,072
Come to the Flamingo Club
tomorrow at midnight

41
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:11,631
Sit on the big sofa,
by the window...

42
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,479
...and wait for us there. Bye

43
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:47,518
- He might be a millionaire
- Yes, like the last one, remember?

44
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:51,157
Oh, the poor thing, but he
was a nice guy

45
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,952
Next evening we had a real ball,

46
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:09,078
Gina was really inspired and
drove me crazy with her naughty tongue

47
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:09,037
At that moment, Matias Grunebaldi
came into our lives...

48
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:34,318
Apparently, he just wanted to take
some innocent porno artistic photos of us

49
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:38,035
But I was sure this rascal
was looking for something else

50
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,838
At that moment, we didn't know
that Kalman was about...

51
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,349
...to hire us

52
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,270
Nor that he was a nazi
son of a bitch

53
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,910
Pretty;

54
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,957
- Hello
- Take your clothes off

55
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:53,678
- We are Red Silk
- I bet you are. Take your clothes off

56
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,912
Take them off, please

57
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,235
If everything's off, money on

58
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,231
What a degenerate youth!

59
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,473
There's a box on the table.
Take half of it

60
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:23,829
Take more

61
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,753
Hey, I said half of it

62
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:37,155
- Do you have eyes on your back?
- The eyes of the spirit

63
00:16:38,359 --> 00:16:42,671
I'm Matias Grunebaldi,
the famous painter

64
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:47,270
Do you know me? No?
What ignorance!

65
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,791
So you made all these
paintings?

66
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:55,119
I painted everything here, even
the walls. Take them off

67
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:59,151
Oh, how beautiful!

68
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:05,995
Oh, what a pair of bottoms!

69
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:10,397
Take them off, everything off!

71
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,869
The great Matias Grunebaldi
will immortalize your show

72
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,879
How lucky you are!

73
00:17:29,879 --> 00:17:30,868
Let's see...

74
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,471
You're really lucky!

75
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,637
Go on. What a pair of bottoms!

77
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:00,236
Oh, wonderful!

78
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:05,391
Oh, beautiful bottoms!

79
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,512
Move, move. Oh, what a
beautiful bottom!

80
00:18:12,719 --> 00:18:14,755
Oh, beautiful!

81
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,554
Oh, que belle! Oh, yes, yes!

82
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,599
Oh, yes, those bottom cheeks!

83
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,270
Wonderful. Move, move!

84
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,719
Go down!

85
00:18:42,879 --> 00:18:43,868
Go down, like in the club

86
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,029
Come on!

87
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,354
Move that, that's it, shake it
with intelligence

88
00:19:08,879 --> 00:19:12,667
More desire, more passion!

89
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:14,353
That way!

90
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,869
Fantastic. Beautiful!

91
00:19:21,999 --> 00:19:25,355
Left, right, left, up!

92
00:19:27,879 --> 00:19:31,633
I'm so happy looking at you.
Don't stop!

93
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:34,590
Stretch out, like this,
with tenderness

94
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,673
Oh, beautiful!

95
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,679
Be more romantic. Love
has to be romantic

96
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:02,997
Try the romanticism of
your bottom

97
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,879
Your bottom has to be romantic

98
00:20:11,999 --> 00:20:16,550
- Do you like it?
- Bah! Too mechanic

99
00:20:18,239 --> 00:20:20,469
- What the he||...!
- Go ahead, baby

100
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:32,156
- More tenderness! More passion!

101
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,158
Your finger in your ass

102
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:43,389
Come on. How beautiful!
How romantic!

103
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:52,679
Touch the teats of your friend

104
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:59,191
Show the romanticism of
your ass hole

105
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,953
Deep inside. Come on!

106
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,231
You are very cold

107
00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:26,355
I don't feel you. I think
I must help you

108
00:21:27,479 --> 00:21:34,396
Come on, with joy! With
passion, with elegance!

110
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:50,797
What a shit! Let me help you

111
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:52,269
Come on!

112
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,952
- If you want to touch, more money!
- Oh, my God. What a generation!

113
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:02,955
Take it all, even the box, come on

114
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,679
Ah!

115
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,675
What a culettol

118
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,955
What a generation!

119
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:01,992
It has been quite all right. Little
bit rude, little bit uncultured...

120
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,348
...but you have a future

121
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:08,878
It shows you haven't read
the divine Marquis of Sade books...

122
00:24:08,999 --> 00:24:13,754
...or heard the Britney Spear's
songs but you are superb

123
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:21,070
Duty calls

124
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,269
Hey! Without me, nothing!

125
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:41,751
I've got a job for you.
I'm going to give you an opportunity

126
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:47,798
- Really?
- A job in a foreign country

127
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,592
- Which country?
- Here, across the border.

128
00:24:50,719 --> 00:24:54,234
- But still being a foreign country
- How much are you going to pay us?

129
00:24:54,399 --> 00:24:57,675
- Money? Again?
- As much as today

130
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,954
I've just spoke to my
partner. The Count of Montecristo

131
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:03,751
- Do you know him?
- No

132
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,438
What ignorance! Well, you
have to bring a little package

133
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,472
- Where to?
- To the place of the appointment

134
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:19,357
- And where's that?
- Hotel Tropicana. The best of the coast

135
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:28,469
Where the princes and kings
and football players go

136
00:25:28,959 --> 00:25:31,029
Thursday at ten you'll be there

137
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:38,313
- When will you give us the package?
- Tomorrow at 11 o'clock in the Pearl bar

138
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,237
Pearl like you

139
00:25:54,959 --> 00:25:56,074
A traitor

140
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:00,159
But he made the impossible to
prevent the military take over

141
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,471
- A son of a bitch
- But in his book, Cayetano...

142
00:26:03,879 --> 00:26:06,916
- Another son of a bitch
- And Costa Gomez?

143
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:09,388
Don't even mention that name,
please

144
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,678
The only honest man of the
whole story was Salazar

145
00:26:18,719 --> 00:26:22,473
Help! Help me, please!

146
00:26:25,239 --> 00:26:27,673
Help:

147
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,996
- Go calm my poor wife down
- Yes, sir

148
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:49,592
Scream, scream

149
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,590
-Are you sure?

150
00:27:12,719 --> 00:27:13,947
Yes, madam

151
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,392
That old good times...

152
00:27:37,959 --> 00:27:40,314
...of peace and justice!

153
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,752
Soon you'll be free, please
be patient, madam

154
00:28:14,879 --> 00:28:18,633
The truth is we also like
hot stuff,

155
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:19,748
but at a different level

156
00:28:21,479 --> 00:28:26,473
We've never gone far than
getting our ass a bit sore

157
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:46,076
- There he is our billy boy
- I think he is a nice guy

158
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:06,512
Oh, those fucking Mercedes!

159
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:14,917
Oh, bambine, belle!

160
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:28,036
- Don't you want to join us?
- I can't. I'm very busy

161
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,879
- Where are you going?
- I've an important business to take care

162
00:29:30,999 --> 00:29:34,833
But, tomorrow, at ten o'clock,
at the other side of the border,

163
00:29:34,959 --> 00:29:37,234
at the hotel Tropical,
it's very important

164
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,877
- What about the packages?
- Bring them. It's essential

165
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,350
Hey. my geranium!

166
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,317
- That billy boy!
- Yes, but he pays

167
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,517
He pays a shit, but he pays
and he took our bread

168
00:30:08,959 --> 00:30:12,349
A piece of bread. You can't
deny him a piece of bread

169
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:17,993
Why do you think
there is in these packages?

170
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:24,758
You know, that kind of shit the
photographers always carry with them

171
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:29,191
-Let's see what's in them
- Fuck, here we go again

172
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,551
You look just like Captain Hook

173
00:30:50,999 --> 00:30:55,038
- Land ho!
- Ah, very funny

174
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,028
- That's ho!
- If it's shit it's for me, for me

175
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:30,067
- Do you know what is it?
- An old print

176
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,876
- Do you know who made it?
- No

177
00:31:32,999 --> 00:31:34,990
Me neither. But it's
worth a fortune

178
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,395
But it's all fucked out

179
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:45,319
It's a museum piece.
This must be...

180
00:31:47,879 --> 00:31:50,074
...one of those famous classics

181
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:59,469
From those times when guys
painted well. It must be a Murillo...

183
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,514
...or one of those

184
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,069
Sure. Someone had to paint it

185
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:18,992
- Why do this always happen to us?
- Because we are a couple of jerks

186
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:23,192
We are rude, we are uncultivated,
I didn't even pass the junior high

187
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:27,473
- You are an ignorant
- Look who's talking. What can you do?

188
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,436
A lot of things. That Italian really
liked the way I sucked him

189
00:32:31,719 --> 00:32:35,917
That bastard? I forbade you to do
that again. Don't you see what he wants?

190
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,353
He wants us to cross the border
with this little picture

191
00:32:39,479 --> 00:32:44,314
And tomorrow, at the other side,
he forgets all about as

192
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,473
- Why didn't he do this?
- Because the police have a file on him

193
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:50,590
Yes, sure

194
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:54,589
He arrives to the border, they
caught the picture and he goes to jail

195
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,312
What a life!
What strange things happen to us!

196
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,670
- You've got your phone, right?
- Yes

197
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,598
- And you've also got Bernabe's
- Bernabe?

198
00:33:19,719 --> 00:33:23,234
- The cop
- The one who touched my ass?

199
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,271
- Yes, call him
- Sure?

200
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:30,635
- Wait!
- Shit!

201
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,072
How will you ask for him?

202
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:36,909
Well, may I speak
to captain Bernabe?

203
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:42,067
- He is just a little cop
- Just a cop? Shit

204
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,555
Is this the police station?

205
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,998
- Mr. Bernabe?
- Who is calling?

206
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,714
- A citizen
- Just a second, Your Highness

207
00:33:56,999 --> 00:34:00,708
Mr. Bernabe, this is Gina, from
top lees, remember me?

208
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:04,798
- Quiet, quiet
- What is the matter? You seem serious

209
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:09,158
- I'm working. What do you want?
- What do we want?

210
00:34:09,999 --> 00:34:14,151
It's very important for him to be
at the hotel Tropicana tomorrow at 9:30

211
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,990
- We're going to have a four show?
- Just say it!

212
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:22,313
It's very important for you to
be at 10 o'clock...

213
00:34:22,839 --> 00:34:27,037
- No, at 9:30!
- Be at 9:30 at the Hotel Tropicana

214
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:30,948
What for? That's not my area

215
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:34,949
- Doesn't matter. You have to be there
- Why? Tina crime be committed?

216
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,475
A crime? A bunch of crimes

217
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:42,037
I'm your best student, am I not?
I'm fucking good

218
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,790
We had a lot of work to do

219
00:35:20,959 --> 00:35:25,271
The same night we had the date
of the Flamingo...

220
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:30,912
...and I almost forgot. Our client
showed up. His face looked familiar

221
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,430
We dedicated him the best
part of our show

222
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:40,156
The final part. The one that
justify our name: Red Silk

223
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:39,668
Hi, sweetheart
Hi, dearies

224
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,440
- Would you like a glass of drink?
-Yes, sure

226
00:38:47,999 --> 00:38:50,229
A bottle of champagne Don Perignon

227
00:38:54,399 --> 00:38:58,790
- Do you come here often?
- Every night

228
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:09,712
How do you like our show?

229
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,037
-Artistically speaking, a piece of shit
- Don't you like it?

230
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:16,590
Well, it was very sexy

231
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,634
- What do you do in life, honey?

232
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,389
- Policeman
- Policeman?

233
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:35,674
I don't believe you!

234
00:39:37,799 --> 00:39:39,596
And I want to talk
seriously with you too

235
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,635
Well, if you want to talk
seriously with us...

236
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,875
We'd better do it in a more
private place

237
00:39:48,999 --> 00:39:51,797
- Do you think so?
- All right

238
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,595
I knew from the first moment that
Fran wasn't a regular customer

239
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:01,072
And that he was lying
about being a cop

240
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:05,589
But he just was so good
looking, so we took him home

241
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,032
Another bottle, Mariano!

242
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:00,673
He offered us a strange job

243
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:06,238
We had to steal a package from
one of Ka|man's car

244
00:41:07,479 --> 00:41:11,870
He never gave us the details
because he got so drunk...

245
00:41:11,999 --> 00:41:14,115
...that fell sleep in our arms

246
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,958
What a disaster!

247
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,074
- Good morning, what can I get you?
- For the lady, a cup of tea

248
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:08,756
- Don't listen to her, a whisky
- No, a cup of tea or you'll get too silly

249
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:11,997
- But I'd like a glass of whisky, please
- And you?

250
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,439
Another whisky

251
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:19,154
I don't see the cop

252
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,871
What if he doesn't show up?

253
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:26,597
You'll see, he'll show up

254
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,958
I like foreign countries!

255
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:33,789
What about it? There's no
place like home

256
00:42:33,919 --> 00:42:37,355
- Were at 30 minutes from home
- Yes, but it's still a foreign country

257
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,719
That man plays very nice!

258
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,754
What a beauty!

259
00:42:57,159 --> 00:42:58,751
Thank you, miss

260
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,877
- Oh, fuck!
- Holy shit!

261
00:43:05,159 --> 00:43:11,507
Here I am, Matias
Garibaldi, the famous piano player

262
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:12,628
Wasn't it Grunebaldi?

263
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:16,799
Grunebaldi as a painter,
Garibaldi as a pianist

264
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:20,072
- And as a fucker?
- As a fucker, Fitipaldi

265
00:43:21,639 --> 00:43:23,550
- May I sit down?
- Yes, of course

266
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,476
- Did you bring the things?
- Yes, yes

267
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,910
- Everything?
- Everything. Did you bring the photos?

268
00:43:33,159 --> 00:43:38,358
- What ignorance! Photos need to
polish and need to be touched up

269
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,553
Have you heard?
When could we see them?

270
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,553
In a couple of months

271
00:43:47,399 --> 00:43:49,867
- You brought everything, don't you?
- Yes, yes

272
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,638
- Everything?
- Everything

273
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,352
- Where is it?
- Right there

274
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:57,234
- Go to get it. Where are you going?
- For the things

275
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:03,268
Nice place here. Foreign
countries are great

276
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:08,837
- What's the matter with your hand?
- What? This? It's a friend of mine

277
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:14,068
- Do you have friends outside?
- All over the world

278
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:20,989
- Your things
- Let's see

279
00:44:24,639 --> 00:44:26,152
What's the matter with
your friend?

280
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:30,877
- What about her hand?
- She's got a silly hand

281
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,231
What the fuck is going on here?

283
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:48,071
Dear chief Bernabé!
Caro amico!

284
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,839
Come to my arms!

285
00:44:52,399 --> 00:44:55,038
I'll have to arrest you. This
time you've gone too far

286
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:59,789
What can I do? This is the fifth
time and he's always so kind

287
00:44:59,919 --> 00:45:04,231
- So kind.
- This time you've gone too far

288
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:09,798
- This miserable painting...
- Yes, miserable but very valuable

290
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,794
- Ciao
- What about us?

291
00:45:14,919 --> 00:45:16,113
Yes, what about us?

292
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:20,752
Be to the police station tomorrow
to sign the report and we'll see

293
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:30,672
My dear friend, couldn't we share
the money and forget all about it?

294
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,358
Impossible, Garibaldi

295
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:37,677
- How much is it worth?
- About one million dollars

296
00:45:37,799 --> 00:45:39,790
Oh, my God, mamma mia!

297
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,556
And I'm going to run my
tongue down your back

298
00:45:44,999 --> 00:45:47,593
Slowly all the way
down to your ass...

299
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:53,395
...and when I get to your ass,
I'm going to stick my finger in it

300
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,273
Come on, you say something

301
00:45:58,799 --> 00:46:05,034
I'm going to suck your cock

302
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,079
- Who is it?
- The police

303
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:10,508
-What?
- The chief Bernabe

304
00:46:11,919 --> 00:46:14,717
Mr. Bernabe!

305
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:17,155
He hang up What a jerk you are!

306
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,316
And you? You slot!

307
00:50:57,239 --> 00:50:58,467
Enough, stop it!

308
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,551
Stop it. Stop it

309
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:07,390
- Didn't you hear the bell?
- I didn't hear anything

310
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:10,158
It's two o'clock, time to
sleep. We'll continue tomorrow

311
00:51:10,279 --> 00:51:11,553
We'll continue tomorrow

312
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:21,356
I was having a good time. Anyway
I have here my Macario

313
00:51:22,519 --> 00:51:25,716
My little thing, Macario
wants to play?

314
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,269
A little kiss. Let me see
your dicky

315
00:51:29,399 --> 00:51:30,593
And your tongue? My Macario

316
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:35,957
I had my Macario as well

317
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,511
And he's hard, hard and
so beautiful

318
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,196
Go to sleep

319
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,192
And I don't know
why you are upset

320
00:52:01,759 --> 00:52:04,319
It is in the show that
we get really hot

321
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:10,793
Fucking in public.
We have to reserve energy

322
00:52:34,839 --> 00:52:39,037
- What's wrong?
- I had a strange dream

323
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:46,032
I dreamt I was giving Macario hard
and he had the biggest dick I've ever seen

324
00:52:46,159 --> 00:52:49,834
Keep blowing and don't leave
the poor thing halfway

325
00:53:14,679 --> 00:53:18,718
Macario, what a cock you have

326
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:25,279
It's pink at the top

327
00:55:23,959 --> 00:55:25,278
No, I can't receive you know.
We're sleeping

328
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:31,069
- But I'm at your door
- Can't it wait till tomorrow evening?

329
00:55:31,759 --> 00:55:35,593
- No, impossible, it's very urgent
- Okay, come inside

330
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:37,068
But I'm already inside

331
00:55:38,599 --> 00:55:39,793
- Come in, then
- Good morning

332
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:51,070
How come you're back in
our lives?

333
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,072
Now I can give you the details

334
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,509
You have to steal that
package from Ka|man's car

335
00:55:56,639 --> 00:55:59,995
- And we'll share
- What the hell are we going to share?

336
00:56:07,439 --> 00:56:09,748
Half of what Kalman
will pay for it

337
00:56:09,879 --> 00:56:14,077
- Half? Half of how much?
- 200.000 dollars

338
00:56:14,679 --> 00:56:17,068
And why should we help
you when we can do the...

339
00:56:17,199 --> 00:56:20,077
...job ourselves and skip
the sharing part?

340
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:26,070
Because if you don't help me,
I'll send you to prison

341
00:56:27,919 --> 00:56:30,114
You're a policeman again, eh?

342
00:56:33,039 --> 00:56:36,190
I don't give a shit if you
believe me or not

343
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:40,512
- I never lie
- Just when you talk, sweetheart!

344
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,231
- You've got two options
- Which one?

345
00:56:47,399 --> 00:56:49,833
To give you all the money or
just half of it

346
00:56:50,639 --> 00:56:54,917
- Either you take the hundred grand...
- What a generous guy!

347
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,359
And tell me what's the other option

348
00:56:57,159 --> 00:57:01,675
That you spend the rest of
your like in a sinister cell

349
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,718
I'll tell you what you have to do

350
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,159
You have to go to Ka|man's place...

351
00:57:14,999 --> 00:57:18,196
...give him the package,
it's a video tape, I think,

352
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:21,869
...and he'll give you an envelope
with the two hundred thousand dollars

353
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,630
Are you sure about it?

354
00:57:24,759 --> 00:57:27,273
- Very sure
- And then, what?

355
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,194
I'll be waiting in the car...

356
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:35,079
...we'll get across the border.
and there we'll get the money...

357
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,350
...and you go your way and
I'll go mine

358
00:57:37,479 --> 00:57:42,507
- Gina, isn't that a great idea?
- A marvelous idea

359
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:18,319
- Look, he's hard
- Oh, let me see...

360
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:23,949
Come on

361
00:58:46,039 --> 00:58:49,031
Please, something
terrible has happened

362
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,271
My friend's panties
are broken

363
00:58:51,399 --> 00:58:53,549
And we can't go to the
governor's party without panties

364
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:55,429
Just a minute

365
00:58:57,799 --> 00:59:00,677
- What's up?
- My friend panties are broken

366
00:59:01,679 --> 00:59:03,237
Can we come and fix it?

367
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:04,873
-Yes, sure, come in
- What an angel!

368
00:59:09,239 --> 00:59:10,354
This way, please

369
00:59:11,559 --> 00:59:14,392
- Sorry, wait here
- Okay

370
00:59:47,239 --> 00:59:50,595
- Is this the ladies room?
- Yes, right there

371
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:45,670
Hey, could you give me a hand?

372
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:48,192
Put your finger right here, please

373
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:14,553
Mariano, listen, you have to
take the Ka|man's car right away

374
01:01:14,679 --> 01:01:17,318
- Which one is it?
- What do you mean? You don't know?

375
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:20,431
- No
- You wrote the note yourself, you stupid

376
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:25,350
- Oh, yes
- Thank you, you got a marvelous finger

378
01:01:38,919 --> 01:01:41,387
How stupid of me!
I forgot to pee

379
01:02:13,479 --> 01:02:16,391
Don't you like it? Millionaires
would pay fortunes to see this

380
01:02:31,479 --> 01:02:32,548
This is golden rain
Do you like it?

381
01:03:09,079 --> 01:03:12,549
- Where have you been?
- You're losing your facs

382
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:14,796
- Did you get it?
- Of course

383
01:03:16,359 --> 01:03:17,792
Hey, wait

384
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:29,078
Once again, Red Silk has done it

385
01:03:31,759 --> 01:03:35,434
The only thing left is to call
the guy and give him the package

386
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:36,909
What's the number?

388
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:46,077
- Wait!
- What is it?

389
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:54,716
I was thinking it's strange that
someone would give us all that money...

390
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:58,071
...for such a simple job like
that. I can't believe it

391
01:03:59,159 --> 01:04:01,389
- So I won't call?
- Wait...

392
01:04:01,519 --> 01:04:04,636
Let's see the pros
and the cons

393
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:06,552
What the hell do you mean?

394
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:12,069
In a way it's best not to call,

395
01:04:12,279 --> 01:04:14,315
but we could lose a lot of money

397
01:04:20,919 --> 01:04:22,272
Why?

398
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:28,158
Because we are maybe losing
the opportunity of our lives

399
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:35,514
I won't call, then

400
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:39,271
I don't know what to say

401
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:43,871
It's a matter of quid pro quo

402
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,709
- And who's that?
- Don't be a nut head!

403
01:04:49,679 --> 01:04:54,628
- I don't call, then
- No, no, yes, yes. Call, call, call now

404
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:59,794
- How was the number?
- 223 25 24

405
01:05:00,599 --> 01:05:01,554
Come on, call now

406
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:07,632
- Wait!
- What's now?

407
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:13,076
Wait. I'm in a fucking dilemma.
Can't you see?

408
01:05:13,839 --> 01:05:17,468
- Give me a break!
- You are irresponsible

409
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:21,270
- We're playing with millions
- I know

410
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:29,149
My head is fucked up. I don't know
if it's better to call and sep the money...

411
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:31,236
...or don't call right now

412
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:34,590
Yes, that's what we'll do
- What?

413
01:05:36,279 --> 01:05:37,632
We are going home

414
01:05:40,999 --> 01:05:42,034
Why home?

415
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,756
Because we have to see what's
in the mysterious package

417
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,514
You never let me use
this phone

419
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:03,434
You are an asshole

420
01:06:55,799 --> 01:06:57,357
Son of a bitch!

421
01:06:58,359 --> 01:07:01,874
No one told us that Kalman was the
main character in this movie

422
01:07:02,919 --> 01:07:05,752
So Kalman is a murderer

423
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,355
And someone is blackmailing him

424
01:07:09,719 --> 01:07:13,871
Who cares is blackmailing him, he's
a son of a bitch, don't you see?

425
01:07:14,599 --> 01:07:19,798
Yes, but we can squeeze
him for much more

426
01:07:21,479 --> 01:07:24,869
Get a tape, we'll do a
copy of this

427
01:07:29,199 --> 01:07:31,394
Kalman is very rich

428
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:38,832
He has to pay a fortune

429
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:46,072
We were so furious that we
decided to fuck him

430
01:07:47,079 --> 01:07:52,233
Leave him without money and
give the tape to our friend Bernabe

431
01:07:52,359 --> 01:07:55,476
What Kalman did with that girl...

432
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:58,796
...he would pay for

433
01:08:03,959 --> 01:08:05,028
May I speak with Mr. Bernabe, please?

435
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:14,752
Come on, talk to him,
you know him better

436
01:08:16,079 --> 01:08:19,435
Mr. Bernabe, we are Red Silk

437
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:22,834
Yes, listen. We have a client and...

438
01:08:24,439 --> 01:08:26,191
...soon he'll be your client

439
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:30,598
And he had committed a crime

440
01:08:31,479 --> 01:08:35,950
An important criminal like
Jack the Ripper...

441
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:40,073
- ...or Drécula
- Are you sure?

442
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:44,548
Yes, sure, you have to get
him, tomorrow night

443
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:49,271
His name is Kalman, we'll leave him
knocked out already for you to get him

444
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:51,192
And if you are a good boy...

445
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:55,474
No, we are expecting
a good reward

446
01:08:57,039 --> 01:09:02,238
For our act of service and if you
are a good boy we'll give you a blow job

447
01:09:03,399 --> 01:09:04,878
Like last January, remember?

448
01:09:06,519 --> 01:09:07,634
He hang LIP

449
01:09:31,639 --> 01:09:33,038
Help! Help!

450
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:39,995
Help, please! Help me!

451
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:04,869
Good morning, madam

452
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:11,553
Don't worry, you'll soon
be free

453
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,516
Doors open easily
these days

454
01:10:42,919 --> 01:10:46,548
This is beautiful! Just
like Blackingham Palace

455
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:48,955
- Buckingham
- That's just what I've said

456
01:12:25,039 --> 01:12:26,028
Aw

457
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,513
Be careful with that.
The devil always loads them

458
01:12:55,799 --> 01:12:57,073
- Hey!
- What?

459
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:59,714
- You're not holding it well
- Why?

460
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:02,991
I've seen it in the movies.
The hold it this way

461
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:31,718
Holy shit!

462
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:39,549
What the fuck are you doing?

463
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:40,954
Look at all these video tapes

464
01:13:46,039 --> 01:13:47,472
There's nothing like having money

465
01:14:00,559 --> 01:14:05,075
Look it there, a telescope, a soccer
game, everything I like

466
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:12,076
Who cares a tape of vide?
We're going to steal 200.000 dollars

467
01:14:30,919 --> 01:14:32,875
Listen, I can wait here

468
01:14:48,559 --> 01:14:50,038
- What's that?
- How should I know?

469
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:52,276
Rich people usually have
nightmares

470
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:55,870
Surely he has vampires, the
place is full of garlic

471
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,672
- I don't like that at all
- What?

472
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:58,789
The garlic

473
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:24,315
Who are you? What do you want?
Don't hurt me, please

474
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:23,200
Listen, mother fucker

475
01:15:28,039 --> 01:15:31,031
If you want money
I have nothing

476
01:15:33,639 --> 01:15:38,474
Bastard! Where do you
hide the checks? Come on

477
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:41,114
We want 200.000 dollars!
Where's the money?

478
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:50,551
- Son of a bitch!
- Bastard, tell me where are the checks

479
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:51,669
Come on!

480
01:15:55,159 --> 01:15:59,949
So you are blackmailing me.
Give me the tape first

481
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:08,308
- Asshole, I'm gonna cut your balls off
- We want all your money

482
01:16:10,159 --> 01:16:12,150
Give me the tape and I'll
Pay V0‘-I

483
01:16:12,639 --> 01:16:17,076
- I feel like cutting your balls off

484
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:21,192
And I will if you don't tell
us where is the money

485
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:26,832
- Tell us where is the money

486
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:29,633
- Tell us!
What have I done?

487
01:16:31,079 --> 01:16:34,992
- You son of a bitch
- You've got three seconds to tell us

488
01:16:35,119 --> 01:16:36,472
Don't hurt me, please

489
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:40,671
- One,...
- What have I done?

490
01:16:41,279 --> 01:16:44,351
- ...two,..
- Speak, you bastard!

491
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:47,757
...and...

492
01:16:47,879 --> 01:16:52,714
I'll give you 300.000 dollars!

493
01:16:56,040 --> 01:17:01,478
You're going to pay for all your
crimes if you don't give us the money

494
01:17:02,839 --> 01:17:04,238
Wait, here!

495
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:15,435
Let me alone. Let me live!

496
01:17:33,519 --> 01:17:36,033
Vargas! Vargas!
Help me!

497
01:18:05,319 --> 01:18:06,229
I left the credit cards and
the checks for you. Vargas

498
01:18:11,879 --> 01:18:15,633
Check out all these cards!

499
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:21,715
Vargas! Vargas!

500
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:36,397
Vargas, what's going on?

501
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:58,989
- We have to save her
- Ok. But she's a bitch like all the others

502
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:03,509
There's no one here!

503
01:19:03,959 --> 01:19:07,429
- She's probably a ghost
- You're the only ghost around here

504
01:19:11,319 --> 01:19:14,709
- Mother fuckers!
- Bastards!

505
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:39,478
This bastard is rich!

506
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:43,036
He may have five dollars
in each account

507
01:20:17,159 --> 01:20:21,152
What we got from the
credit cards was alright

508
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:23,157
But not enough

509
01:20:23,279 --> 01:20:26,828
So we decided to try
with the checks

510
01:20:41,959 --> 01:20:43,233
What music is this?

511
01:20:44,919 --> 01:20:47,558
- What are you saying?
- What are you listening to?

512
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:49,991
Rumbas, great!

513
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:12,549
In a couple of hours we
got nearly half a million dollars

514
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:18,598
So I decided the best thing
to do was to leave the country,

515
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:20,836
even thought Gina didn't
like the idea

516
01:21:21,879 --> 01:21:25,508
Don't you feel sorry leaving?
We had enjoyed this house

517
01:21:25,639 --> 01:21:28,199
Now we are rich and we'll be
the queen of Saba?

518
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:34,759
But we had a lot of fun.
- We own the rent and the phone

519
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:36,871
But now we are millionaires
we could pay it

520
01:21:51,639 --> 01:21:53,311
- Wait a second
- What?

521
01:21:53,439 --> 01:21:55,430
- I forgot something
- What?

522
01:21:55,559 --> 01:21:56,958
- Macario
- Who is Macario?

523
01:21:57,080 --> 01:22:00,550
- It's my teddy bear
- I'll buy you a real bear

524
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:02,079
I want Macario.
Wait a minute

525
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:18,393
Hurry up, we have 35 miles
to the border

526
01:22:18,519 --> 01:22:20,749
It's not my fault, I didn't
put it there

527
01:22:33,599 --> 01:22:38,627
- We're rich, where should we go?
- To the Caiman Islands

528
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:42,196
The Caiman Islands?
Is that dangerous?

529
01:22:42,359 --> 01:22:45,431
No, not more than any
other places

530
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:49,159
- Is it far?
- If you swim, yes

531
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:51,874
- But we'll take a flight
- Caiman Islands

532
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:55,273
How exotic! Beautiful!

533
01:22:55,399 --> 01:22:58,038
I'm going to fuck every
guy I meet there

534
01:22:58,159 --> 01:23:01,993
- Now you like men?
- If they're exotic and strange...

535
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:37,949
You didn't believe all
our fantasy, ah?

536
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:43,351
Don't worry, we're still
alive and still strong

537
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:48,000
Some things in our
story are true...

538
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:51,829
...others aren't,
we just wanted to get you horny...

539
01:23:51,959 --> 01:23:54,996
...and wake your interest
in us

540
01:23:55,799 --> 01:23:57,869
Afer all, we are love girls

541
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:01,199
And we are still at the
Flamingo club

542
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:07,110
If you want to meet us
just send your request by mail

543
01:24:07,519 --> 01:24:12,070
Red Silk will
contact you
