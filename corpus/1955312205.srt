YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

1053
01:33:57,966 --> 01:34:00,678
IF I HIT HIM NOW,
THE BLAST ALONE

1054
01:34:00,803 --> 01:34:02,780

General Lindsay:
WE'RE PREPARED TO ACCEPT
CIVILIAN CASUALTIES.

1056
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:08,251

I WANT TO GIVE YOU
A CHANCE TO PROVE YOURSELF.

1064
01:34:30,198 --> 01:34:33,243
MAYBE YOU REALLY ARE
THE ONE, EDDIE.

1065
01:34:33,368 --> 01:34:37,139
MAYBE YOU REALLY ARE
DOING GOD'S WORK.

1066
01:34:39,274 --> 01:34:41,284
SHOW ME, EDDIE.

1067
01:34:41,409 --> 01:34:43,954

1073
01:34:52,988 --> 01:34:54,898
YOU TAKE ME OUT,

1074

WE'LL KNOW
YOU'RE REALLY THE ONE.

1075

YOU WANT TO STOP ME,
THEN YOU COME AFTER ME.

Controller: 3 MILES.

1082
01:35:16,211 --> 01:35:17,387

TO YOU, EDDIE.

1083
01:35:17,512 --> 01:35:20,783
YOU PROVE IT
OR YOU DIE.

RINGLEADER,
IS THERE ANY WAY

1093
01:36:35,623 --> 01:36:37,873
YOU CAN FORCE HIM
TO LAND?

1094
01:36:38,927 --> 01:36:40,137
NO.

1095
01:36:40,262 --> 01:36:42,512
