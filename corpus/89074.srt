1
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:23,337
Looks like they had a quiet night.

2
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,309
My army of souls.

3
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,610
Ready to travel to distant lands.

4
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:33,346
Was she crying?

5
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,649
No. She was awake.
They just need to be cuddled.

6
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:42,021
You spoil them.

7
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:44,194
Of course I do.

8
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:07,115
A spider bit me.

9
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,509
Shut up.

10
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:12,547
- Wanna wash windshields today?
- Thieves! Little bastards!

11
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:13,848
Beat it!

12
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:17,292
One-eye! One-eye!
Go fuck yourself!

13
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,624
Little thugs.

14
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,846
- It's our turn to sing today.
- Great.

15
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:45,156
I remember it. But that was
the year I had to leave.

16
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,189
You never got to sing it?

17
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,758
Just in rehearsals.
Mami was really sick.

18
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,758
It's better if you wait.

19
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,226
You need to wear your shoes.

20
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:56,559
They hurt me. They're too small.

21
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:59,861
Well, put them on
before you go inside the school.

22
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:04,200
He's so bad. He hangs out
with that gang that tortures the dogs.

23
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:06,408
Liar!

24
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:07,702
Shut up!

25
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:11,445
Take care of the stove.
And do what you can with him.

26
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,896
Which one do you work in?

27
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:18,093
The Posada Santa Marta.

28
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:21,738
Do the mothers leave you tips?

29
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:26,239
Not many.
But if you need diapers, it's heaven.

30
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,251
I've only got ten cents.

31
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:37,882
Tough shit.

32
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:39,783
Can you rent it?

33
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:41,081
How much?

34
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:43,250
Ten cents.

35
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:48,558
You don't bring it back,
I break your arm.

36
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:50,166
If you can catch me!

37
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:40,646
Six bags of trash I emptied.

38
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,019
People are so filthy.

39
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,659
Is she here yet?

40
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:49,986
As always.

41
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:07,005
- Any problems?
- 214 as usual.

42
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,683
Not enough pressure in the shower
and the AC is too loud.

43
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:13,976
Witch.

44
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:23,590
They want to be mothers and they
can't even take of themselves.

45
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:28,365
Good morning, ma'am. Excuse me.

46
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:32,000
Your clerks said I should ask you
if there's any work.

47
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,368
Right now there's nothing.

48
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:38,175
I'm available right away...

49
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:40,601
Really, there's nothing.

50
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:43,912
I can do whatever.

51
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,551
I can cook, clean. I can...

52
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:52,417
If I hire you,
I have to pay the others less.

53
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:56,386
It's already tough for them
to make a living.

54
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,693
I understand. Thanks.

55
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,901
Is there somewhere else I could...?

56
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:11,302
I'm sorry.

57
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,811
A crazy woman.

58
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:51,441
Breast strokes
right through the ice cubes.

59
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:54,080
Must be the Aryan blood.

60
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,722
Her people are mostly Swedish...
Lutherans.

61
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:04,028
- Buenos días. Rubén.
- Buenos días. Sennora.

62
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:07,532
And will the ladies
be taking a liquid this morning?

63
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,827
And why not?

64
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:15,101
A fruit plate, por favor.
and a joo-go of orange.

65
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:18,632
It's jugo. Not joo-go.
Give me a break here.

66
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:21,271
- You're so good at it.
- I studied it.

67
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,508
Yeah, but you've got an ear.

68
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:26,312
I just sound like some old cracker.

69
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,988
It will arrive suddenly.

70
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:19,428
The children are so adorable.

71
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:23,168
You just wanna bake them
some cookies and give them a bath.

72
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:26,175
- Morning, ladies.
- Hi.

73
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:29,874
- Our water sprite in her element?
- Building her calorie debt.

74
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,712
Don't I wish I had one of those.

75
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:33,081
Is Eileen coming down?

76
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:35,848
We knocked,
but she said she's not hungry.

77
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,186
Ga"s missing a lot of meals.

78
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,590
- She's on a budget... Eileen.
- I'll say.

79
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,788
Woman gives two centavos
to some little beggar boy,

80
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:47,264
it goes right in that notebook of hers.

81
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,801
She doesn't bitch and moan
about the prices like some people.

82
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:52,667
Bargaining is a respected part
of the culture here.

83
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:54,968
If you don't complain,
they take advantage of you.

84
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,338
Besides, she's a professor.

85
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:59,240
- She's in clerical.
- At a university.

86
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:01,438
Which probably pays worse
than publishing.

87
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:04,483
I think her husband is between jobs.

88
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,313
Unemployed.

89
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:09,513
Actually, no.
I think he's freelancing.

90
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:12,716
He's looking for a job
and hasn't found one yet... unemployed.

91
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,295
So they lied on the application.

92
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:19,558
Or he got laid off after it went through.

93
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:24,692
Do you suppose the fellow back there

94
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:29,730
could do me up a pair of eggs,
over easy, so they're not runny,

95
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,107
but they're not scabby on the outside?

96
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:34,305
I will order it done.

97
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:38,714
And bacon... crispy, so you break it.
You don't tear it.

98
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:41,218
We will attempt to comply
with this, sennora.

99
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:44,154
And fruit plate?

100
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:58,359
You take the even ones
and I'll take the odd ones.

101
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:01,065
Excuse me. Socorro?

102
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,665
Right? Ascension?

103
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,077
I knew it was some religious holiday.

104
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:08,670
Buenos días...

105
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:15,486
Can I get another one?

106
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:18,520
- They're Catholic.
- So?

107
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:22,254
That might make a difference
down here with the agency people.

108
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:25,126
If somebody stipulates that the kid
has to be raised Catholic, yeah.

109
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,062
- They can do that?
- Why not?

110
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:30,167
Seems like under the circumstances...

111
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:32,261
Beggars can't be choosers.

112
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:34,602
I think that might be the motto
at the orphanage...

113
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:40,170
Maybe faith is different.

114
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:42,544
You must've told them
you'll raise yours up in your sect.

115
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:43,673
Religion.

116
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:46,650
And that child's parents
have no say in the matter.

117
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:51,119
She's been skipping dinner
a lot, too... Eileen.

118
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,452
Room service.

119
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:55,618
No, I don't ever see any trays
in front of her door in the morning.

120
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:58,458
Maybe we oughta find
a way to treat, then,

121
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,725
and just not make
a big deal about it.

122
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:06,762
Easy, easy now. You're so lucky.

123
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:10,200
You'll have a car
with its own little house.

124
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,511
You'll go to a pretty school

125
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,574
with all the Yankee kids.

126
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:19,875
You'll have perfect teeth

127
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:23,412
and a huge bedroom.

128
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,187
Let him breathe.

129
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:30,217
The expert.

130
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,627
My grandmother did this job,
and my mother, too.

131
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:36,698
They did it nature's way.

132
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:39,370
Nature's way?

133
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:41,096
Breast-feeding.

134
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,101
Wet nurses?

135
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:44,199
Right here.

136
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:47,942
Have you ever tried it?

137
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:03,155
Wash your windshield?

138
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:06,798
Wash your windshield?

139
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:30,311
She's only 30.
How can she be sick of men already?

140
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:33,112
- That's what she said.
- She's a dyke.

141
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:34,652
She is not.

142
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,689
She might as well be one
with the attitude she's got.

143
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:40,020
- Have you seen her tattoo?
- How can you see anything?

144
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:42,856
She won't wear a bathing suit
like a normal person.

145
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,296
It's an ankh.

146
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,424
- What's an ankh?
- Her tattoo.

147
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,968
Right, but what is that?

148
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:54,199
- And where is it?
- It's on her heinie.

149
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,366
How did you see it there?

150
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:57,739
What's an ankh?

151
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,244
She pulled her pants down for me.

152
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:04,138
I told you she's a dyke.

153
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:07,185
We were talking about tattoos
and she showed me.

154
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:10,386
Wes has got a snake

155
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,651
wrapped around a dagger
on his shoulder.

156
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:14,692
Your husband has a snake?

157
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:18,628
Am I the only one
who doesn't know what this is?

158
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:21,666
It's a symbol. It's Egyptian.

159
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:25,260
- For what?
- It means you're a lesbian.

160
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:27,066
Stop.

161
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,671
She says it symbolizes life.

162
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:34,541
I can't believe
they're gonna give her one

163
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:38,208
when there's so many of us,
with husbands, who want to adopt.

164
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,773
Oh, come on.

165
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:42,286
A child needs a father.

166
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,181
I grew up without one.

167
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:49,650
I had four.

168
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:52,524
Stepfathers.

169
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:56,694
My mother always said she hoped
the next one would turn out better.

170
00:18:56,768 --> 00:19:00,169
Oh, Lord. I can't look.

171
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:05,770
That oughta be a crime.

172
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:10,144
They look pretty happy.
They're underfed, but happy.

173
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:11,648
Makes me miss my puppies.

174
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:14,550
- What are they?
- Jack Russells.

175
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:17,283
We raise about a dozen at a time.

176
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:21,053
My George can get them fed on schedule
and give them their shots, but...

177
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:23,458
...they need their mama.

178
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:48,151
I can show you
how to swim if you want.

179
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,949
As if.

180
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,249
- You are afraid?
- Fish urinate in this stuff.

181
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,418
You think I'm gonna
stick my face in it?

182
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:02,155
- You are here alone?
- With my posse.

183
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:05,597
With your mother.

184
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,034
I appreciate that.

185
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:13,938
- You are a punk?
- That would be stretching it.

186
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:17,675
- You are a beach boy?
- Student.

187
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,510
And this is like a field trip?

188
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,088
Have you been to a disco here?

189
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,457
We have a lot of club.

190
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,559
Everybody on the beach can see that.

191
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:32,921
Would you like to go with me to one?

192
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,630
- What's your name?
- I'm Reynaldo.

193
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:41,400
Sorry, Reynaldo.
I've got socks older than you are.

194
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:51,680
Good run?

195
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:54,046
Terrific.

196
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:56,917
We're just deciding whether
Leslie should have a kid or not.

197
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,047
Do you wanna vote?

198
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:02,890
Whoever she gets,
I hope they've got no sense of fashion.

199
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:05,720
I'm sure in New York she looks fine.

200
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:07,264
She's what, a proofreader?

201
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,427
Editor... fiction books.

202
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:12,868
She gave me one she worked on.

203
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:13,927
What was it like?

204
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:17,270
Kinda racy, lots of language.

205
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:20,641
- Language?
- Curse words.

206
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:23,337
She's gonna have to get an au pair.

207
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:27,748
- Can she afford that?
- She's in publishing.

208
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:30,413
If she is a lesbian,
she won't have to worry.

209
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,514
They'll have it all organized.

210
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:44,157
Mom...

211
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,295
The one in 214...

212
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:50,302
Don't mess with the shower.

213
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:51,598
But she complained.

214
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,808
This woman...

215
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:58,139
changed rooms three times.
She's done nothing but complain.

216
00:21:58,617 --> 00:21:59,811
Wait for Herminio.

217
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:02,119
And clean your glasses.

218
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:09,159
We should take it apart and leave it
a few days, see how she likes it.

219
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:13,092
Great idea.
She'll be in my face, not yours.

220
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,326
Wait for Herminio.

221
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:17,864
If you're going to watch this crap,
you should get cable.

222
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,330
Leave it alone.

223
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:21,367
- I can fix it.
- You?

224
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:24,535
Who's done more damage
with those pliers

225
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,868
than with your Molotov cocktails?

226
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,545
I'd like to light...

227
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:31,705
214 up.

228
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:35,714
Listen, Mister.

229
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:39,886
We don't threaten our guests here.

230
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,181
Understand?

231
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:44,286
Why do we have to kiss
their imperialist asses?

232
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,629
They're our guests.

233
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:51,795
It's how we make a living.

234
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,903
And if you don't have a job,

235
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,142
the judge sends you back to jail.

236
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,175
You and Uncle Ernesto,
selling babies!

237
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,806
- We provide a service.
- A service...

238
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:05,208
for rich Yankees who...

239
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:10,822
Would you be happier
if the rich mothers came from here?

240
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:12,520
Parasites!

241
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:15,319
Fat, corrupt...

242
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:24,925
When I'm dead,
you can invite your terrorist friends...

243
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:29,400
fleas and all, to live here for free.

244
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,266
But until that day,

245
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:35,210
we provide food and lodging

246
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:39,282
of high quality
to those who can pay.

247
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:42,586
And clean those damn glasses!

248
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:51,922
She never got fatter,
which is a miracle

249
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:56,599
with the crap kids eat these days.
We had no idea of her condition.

250
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:59,530
Do you know what month you're in?

251
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:02,432
Maybe the second.
The third at the most.

252
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:06,268
They don't tell us anything.
When I was a girl...

253
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:08,307
Have you considered an abortion?

254
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:10,441
That's not an option.

255
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,444
And raising it?

256
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:15,809
She's barely fifteen.

257
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,645
There are a lot of mothers who...

258
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:19,345
Not Celia.

259
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:22,516
So what now?
We bring it back here

260
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:24,255
or give it up there?

261
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:26,429
We'll arrange that later.

262
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,999
And Celia... what do you think?

263
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:42,176
Consuelo.

264
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:45,315
That's your name for her, or theirs?

265
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:47,078
That's her name.

266
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:50,653
- That she was given by...
- By her birth mother.

267
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:03,361
We plan to change ours to Henley.

268
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:04,732
Your husband's name?

269
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:11,569
- So they'll call him Junior?
- They'll call him Henley, Jr.

270
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:13,042
You know, they can't say their J's.

271
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:16,772
- You making fun of me?
- No, really, it's genetic.

272
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,645
Leslie, don't be mean.

273
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:21,413
It'll be, "My name is Henley Yunior."

274
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:58,085
Which one do you like?

275
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,199
- You visiting here?
- Si.

276
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:21,945
I don't know what to buy.

277
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:58,477
Thank you.

278
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:04,143
Damn it!

279
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:12,660
You can't use that if you can't read.

280
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,056
It's mine!

281
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,948
That's really beautiful work.

282
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:34,916
I'd like something wider... cover this up.

283
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,580
- Birthmark?
- It's a burn.

284
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:38,782
Ouch.

285
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:42,452
That's how I learned what "hot" meant.

286
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:45,696
Knocked over the steam iron?

287
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:48,062
I was playing with the knobs
on the stove,

288
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:50,931
which my mother had told me
not to do a million times,

289
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:54,870
and she had a skillet in her hand,
so she grabbed my wrist...

290
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:57,406
God.

291
00:27:57,475 --> 00:28:00,467
"You don't obey your mother,
this is what happens."

292
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:01,807
That's awful.

293
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,348
She never had to
repeat herself to me again.

294
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:08,116
Kids have to learn sometime.

295
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:15,756
Well! They saw you coming.

296
00:28:26,771 --> 00:28:28,136
Is Herminio here?

297
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:29,696
Not yet.

298
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:34,635
I'll be in the bathroom.

299
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:06,205
Water pressure, my ass.

300
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:07,061
You ladies are braver than I.

301
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,231
Looks like Hemingway's rec room.

302
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:12,105
- What's "sea food" again?
- Mariscos.

303
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:14,475
What's the difference
between grouper and snapper?

304
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:15,672
Is there one?

305
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:20,878
I'll have a mojito with lime,
not lemon.

306
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:22,385
They know how to make 'em.

307
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:24,182
I didn't see any limes on the counter.

308
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,514
Una cola?

309
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,156
- What did I say?
- That you wanted a tail.

310
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:35,631
- I'm hopeless.
- Daiquiri, por favor.

311
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:39,227
- Agua?
- You didn't order bottled.

312
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:41,238
It's a restaurant.
It's in the guidebook.

313
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:45,072
Personally, I plan to get out
of this country with my plumbing intact.

314
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:46,269
Where's Miss Congeniality?

315
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:49,643
She's off to run a marathon
before lunch, work up an appetite.

316
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:51,511
She likes to keep fit.

317
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:54,108
And Hitler liked a parade...
woman is obsessed.

318
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,311
What's the name of that movie

319
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:58,014
where all the housewives
turn into perfect-looking clones?

320
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:00,557
Her husband is gorgeous.

321
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:03,856
- You met him?
- I saw a picture.

322
00:31:03,928 --> 00:31:06,453
Hiking in the Rockies,
glowing with health.

323
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,556
She's very sweet.
She's upbeat.

324
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:10,760
She's been waiting here
longer than the rest of us,

325
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:12,962
and she's still got a positive attitude.

326
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:15,301
I trust her as far as I can throw her.

327
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,807
That's because you're from New York.

328
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,503
That's 'cause I'm from planet Earth.

329
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:21,875
Someday, one of her microchips
is gonna misfire.

330
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:23,277
You'll see the real Skipper.

331
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:25,908
She'll open her mouth,
this thing with six heads will come out.

332
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:28,680
There have been plenty of nasty things
to come out of your mouth.

333
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:29,845
Thank you.

334
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:33,486
Guess how many seafood places
called "El Pescadero"

335
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,219
there are in this neighborhood.

336
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:37,227
We ordered you
the bacon cheeseburger.

337
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:40,355
If it's 2:30 here, then in Virginia...

338
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:43,992
It's 2:30. It's the same latitude.
Longitude?

339
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,660
I have to call Henley.

340
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:50,634
Poor thing.

341
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:53,836
Yeah, house in Newport,
estate outside of D.C.,

342
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,402
boat bigger than my apartment?

343
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,449
- They almost split up.
- Jennifer and Henley, Sr.?

344
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:01,144
That's not the best time
to be adopting a child.

345
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:03,084
Maybe we should rat her out
to the agency.

346
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:06,921
Maybe raising a child together
will help their marriage.

347
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:09,357
My daddy always said
that children were the glue

348
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:10,724
that held a marriage together.

349
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:12,786
In my parents' marriage,
I was more like the hammer.

350
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:15,230
My mother used me
to bang dents in my father.

351
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,461
If they really are
on the verge of breakup,

352
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:20,265
I would hope that whoever
was providing the personal references...

353
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:22,329
Had the good sense to lie
when necessary.

354
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:24,170
How can you say that?

355
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:26,301
'Cause if you're clueless enough
to ask somebody

356
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:28,106
who'd slag you
on an adoption reference,

357
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:29,874
you deserve what you get.

358
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:33,380
The whole thing is such a game.

359
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,180
They're just doing
what they think is best.

360
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:36,311
For their bank accounts.

361
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:39,117
Why do you think
they've got us down here for so long?

362
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,017
They're gonna make us
earn our babies.

363
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:45,119
- It's part of the balance of trades.
- It's not like that.

364
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:49,292
I'll bet you two pina coladas her Henley
will fly down here some weekend,

365
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:53,030
make a donation
to Our Lady of Perpetual Red Tape,

366
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:55,334
and they'll fly off
with a little bundle of joy.

367
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:57,237
You sound so bitter.

368
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,606
I have been here over two months.

369
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:02,075
Pregnant women wait nine.

370
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:05,115
Yeah, but they get to throw up
and develop varicose veins.

371
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:08,885
Leaving Sunday with a baby.

372
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:10,614
Wouldn't that be awesome?

373
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,886
I called them yesterday and...

374
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:20,795
they said they'd let me know
if anything...

375
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:24,729
If you make yourself a nuisance,

376
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:27,293
they stick you at the bottom of the pile.

377
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:35,440
Well, you're not here, Henley.
I'm here.

378
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,316
No, I don't think you should call
the Korean people.

379
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:51,758
This isn't
the commodities market, Henley.

380
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:56,461
Right.

381
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:02,197
Right... yeah.

382
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:06,707
I just miss you.

383
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,404
You know, there's a lizard in my room.

384
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:16,376
No, a lizard, not a blizzard.

385
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:19,618
No, I said a lizard,

386
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:23,217
like a chameleon, a gecko...

387
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:27,125
A lizard. Yeah.

388
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:31,065
It makes this little noise
at night, it's nice.

389
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:35,429
Okay.

390
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:41,002
I miss... Hello?

391
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,221
I didn't say
they don't have papaya.

392
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:53,655
I said "papaya"
is another word for "pussy."

393
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:56,917
- Pussy words?
- Vaginal euphemism.

394
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:58,962
Beaver, clam...

395
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,191
Nobody here ordered clams,
did they?

396
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:04,462
The lower on the food chain you eat,
the better the nutritional value.

397
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:07,060
Though the risk of toxicity increases.

398
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:10,133
Thank you for sharing.

399
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:14,008
There is probably every disease
known to man down here.

400
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:15,875
Elephantitis, beri-beri...

401
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:19,673
The thing for all of us to worry about
are the infant syndromes,

402
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:23,481
like... where the mother
is intoxicated.

403
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:25,954
- FAS.
- And drugs.

404
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:27,285
Crack, all that.

405
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:29,318
They have crack here?

406
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:33,560
Then there's the genes.

407
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:36,395
- What do you do about genes?
- My point exactly.

408
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:39,903
You could adopt a ticking time bomb
and never know it.

409
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:41,970
It's the same with birth kids.

410
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:45,440
But birth kids, you know both parents.
You know family history.

411
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:48,445
In my family, sometimes
people are born with six toes.

412
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:52,376
On one foot.

413
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,683
People assume
that if they have kids,

414
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:58,017
they'll inherit all their favorite qualities.

415
00:35:58,089 --> 00:35:59,681
If you get dealt a weak hand,

416
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:02,624
you can always train it
out of them, but it's work.

417
00:36:02,693 --> 00:36:05,560
- Roll up a newspaper.
- I'm serious.

418
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,791
If they are born
with some kind of disability...

419
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:11,926
racial, cultural, whatever...
you make them aware.

420
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:15,063
They've got some catching up to do,
and you stay on their case.

421
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:18,905
I think you just watch them
and see who they are

422
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:21,103
and encourage what's best in them.

423
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:24,637
Mine had better be calm.
The one-neurotic-per-family rule.

424
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:28,674
Appetizers. Skipper, any damage
this is gonna do to my wellness,

425
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:30,277
I don't wanna hear about it.

426
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:52,170
Can you read this?

427
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:57,305
- Sure. It's about a goat.
- Will you read it to me?

428
00:36:58,516 --> 00:36:59,574
Maybe later.

429
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:01,676
Look! Look!

430
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:06,752
- Think we can sell it?
- Did they use it?

431
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,029
If they did, nothing came out.

432
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:13,285
What is it?

433
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:16,166
If Mom had had one of these,
we wouldn't be here.

434
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:22,034
They arrange it all.

435
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:25,571
We just sign the papers

436
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:28,208
and hand over the baby.

437
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:31,537
Her?

438
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:34,417
Mute like always.

439
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:40,890
I don't think she understands
how serious this is.

440
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:46,961
Can I help you?

441
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,632
I need to buy jeans a size bigger.

442
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:54,760
Maybe two.

443
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:58,100
And this one?

444
00:37:58,175 --> 00:38:01,303
It's cheaper, but it only pays
if all the numbers come up.

445
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:02,534
And then?

446
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,274
If you win,
you're king of the world.

447
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:15,618
I'll take just one.

448
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:29,767
No, gracias.

449
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:38,777
Ladies, ladies,
if you choose one of them,

450
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:40,817
the others, they go away.

451
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:42,375
How much is it?

452
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:45,047
Whatever you think
is reasonable is fine.

453
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:48,353
I don't know, what is this,
four dollars?

454
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:49,586
That is very reasonable.

455
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,720
- Are you available?
- Absolutely, yes. Always.

456
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:00,699
Blanca's learning to use a computer.

457
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,466
In school? They have that now?

458
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:06,505
They've only got one.
The students take turns.

459
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:10,678
So if she wants to go to the moon...

460
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:13,279
You need it for everything
these days.

461
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:16,479
To clean rooms?

462
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:21,790
The Royal Princess has a computer

463
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:26,018
that says which rooms are ready
and which need cleaning.

464
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:27,490
But the maids?

465
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:30,063
The maids just clean.

466
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:33,902
We're too old to learn that stuff.

467
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,368
Want to walk to the beach
if there's time left?

468
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:43,509
- The waves scare me.
- The waves?

469
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:44,873
I can't swim.

470
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:47,676
Right, you're a mountain girl.

471
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:56,151
I really think
Blanca's going to graduate.

472
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:59,020
If some guy doesn't nail her first.

473
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:00,988
We made a deal.

474
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:04,363
She graduates
without getting pregnant,

475
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:06,660
and I don't wring her neck.

476
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:11,007
My sister used to threaten
to sew me up.

477
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:13,233
It didn't work.

478
00:40:21,051 --> 00:40:24,282
You think the American mothers
eat the same stuff we do?

479
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:26,445
Sure.

480
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,851
But they always want it
cooked without lard.

481
00:40:31,395 --> 00:40:32,885
Are they Jews?

482
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:35,462
How long have you been a guide?

483
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:41,162
I'm not, but if you're with me,
the others won't be bothering you.

484
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:43,206
- We appreciate it.
- Thank you.

485
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,765
- Your English is very good.
- I wish that was true.

486
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:50,011
- How did you learn it?
- At the movies.

487
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:54,080
We have a cinema here
and the actors speak in English,

488
00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:57,882
and... they...

489
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,946
- They write under.
- The subtitles.

490
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:02,993
Right. It's a very good school,
believe me.

491
00:41:05,362 --> 00:41:07,694
If you're not a guide,
what do you do?

492
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:11,863
Now it's very difficult for us,

493
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:15,099
for all the people here,
and we have crisis.

494
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:17,163
We have economics crisis.

495
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:20,404
Politics as well.

496
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:24,312
- We have had some trouble.
- You're out of work?

497
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:29,081
Yes.

498
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:32,281
I was building houses and...

499
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:34,824
- Office, schools...
- Construction.

500
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:37,884
Yes, but that...

501
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:39,759
Business is not so good now.

502
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:42,623
It's a pity.

503
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:47,160
You girls...
are you here for your vacations?

504
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:52,500
We're adopting babies.

505
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:57,372
Sure. It's our greatest exportation.

506
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:01,808
They're gonna get hit on
whether we're with them or not.

507
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:03,649
Maybe they'll meet some Latin hunk.

508
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:06,554
- They're not looking.
- It's still good for the ego.

509
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:10,556
Are you... looking?

510
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:14,189
For a guy?
I figured I've given that enough time.

511
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:17,325
I better get this baby thing started
before I'm too old.

512
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:19,232
It's tough being a single mother.

513
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:22,235
But you've only got a fight
on one front.

514
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:25,673
You think the kid should go to bed
at 6:00, there's no big debate.

515
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:29,179
- You're getting a girl, right?
- Rebecca.

516
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:32,147
- What's yours again?
- We haven't decided yet.

517
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,444
I'm not gonna be one of these ones

518
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:35,917
where there's lots of choices
about the basic stuff.

519
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:39,717
It's gonna be, "Here's your
breakfast. Eat it or go hungry."

520
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:42,258
She's not gonna call me
by my first name

521
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:44,726
or have a cell phone
by the time she's 15.

522
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:46,422
Tough love.

523
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:48,089
I see these women in New York,

524
00:42:48,165 --> 00:42:50,793
it's like their daughters
are their best friend.

525
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:54,201
They go to the same hair salon,
the same shrink?

526
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:58,672
Forget it. I wanted more friends,
I'd host a slumber party.

527
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:03,970
You think Zorro hung out here?

528
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:09,416
I'm not certain
what you wish me to do.

529
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:11,113
Your petition has been filed,

530
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:13,816
the placement procedure
is underway, so?

531
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:15,722
We're paying you.

532
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:19,593
I have to comply
between both your wishes

533
00:43:19,663 --> 00:43:21,153
and the laws of my country.

534
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:24,394
So we do all the paperwork
and you just pass it on?

535
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:28,234
It may appear that way,
but I can assure you that everything is...

536
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:33,072
They said that we had to hire
a local lawyer or it was no dice.

537
00:43:33,143 --> 00:43:35,236
That's one of the regulations, yes.

538
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:39,749
If you are unhappy, I can always
recommend you another advocate,

539
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:43,878
but to change at this point
might prejudice your case.

540
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:45,751
So you've got us over a barrel?

541
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:49,782
At this rate, the baby will be
talking full sentences before I get it.

542
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,885
I don't wanna have to undo all that.

543
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:53,429
Undo?

544
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:55,658
These are crucial months for learning!

545
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:57,530
I understand this.

546
00:43:57,601 --> 00:44:00,570
What I want
is for you to move our file

547
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:03,402
from the bottom
of whatever pile it's on to the top!

548
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:04,463
Sennora...

549
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:12,375
If we receive our child by...

550
00:44:13,283 --> 00:44:15,683
...the end of this week,

551
00:44:15,753 --> 00:44:19,883
there will be some kind
of bonus in it for you,

552
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:22,585
on top of your usual fee.

553
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,720
The government doesn't
permit us to accept any kind...

554
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:28,287
The government doesn't have to
know anything about this, do they?

555
00:44:28,365 --> 00:44:31,232
Unless, of course, there's someone
that you have to pay off,

556
00:44:31,301 --> 00:44:34,702
and then you just let me know
the amount, and I will make sure...

557
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:38,969
I will pretend
you never suggested this.

558
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:43,679
Bonus or not, it's still your job.

559
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:46,209
Believe me,

560
00:44:46,283 --> 00:44:49,081
you don't want my husband
to have to come down here.

561
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:54,415
I will do my best effort,

562
00:44:54,491 --> 00:44:57,051
but I promise you nothing.

563
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:05,225
DOESN'T SPEAK SPANISH

564
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:20,405
It's Ernest.

565
00:45:21,085 --> 00:45:23,076
Hey, brother. What's up?

566
00:45:23,754 --> 00:45:25,346
The American ladies bugging you?

567
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:27,587
I'm here with a client,

568
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:29,415
a Nancy Hightower.

569
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:31,827
The one in 214.

570
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:33,994
She's a witch.

571
00:45:34,798 --> 00:45:38,325
Rubén and the rest of them
want to poison her,

572
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:43,233
but she's paid up through Monday.

573
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:45,875
Two months, one week.

574
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:48,509
Could you live
with an early departure?

575
00:45:51,648 --> 00:45:52,945
It would make you happy?

576
00:45:53,383 --> 00:45:56,511
Get her out of here!
The sooner, the better!

577
00:45:56,787 --> 00:45:58,687
I understand perfectly.

578
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:04,853
What did the judge say
about Buho's case?

579
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:07,896
That my nephew
is an enemy of the state.

580
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:11,032
Tell him Che is ancient history.

581
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:16,037
Okay. See you Sunday.

582
00:46:18,575 --> 00:46:22,102
I have made an inquiry.

583
00:46:23,747 --> 00:46:27,148
I was right here.
What did they say?

584
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:28,946
No promises have been given,

585
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:33,388
but your paperwork
is entering the final phase.

586
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,891
That's what you said the last time
I got you on the phone.

587
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:38,359
Yes, but this is the final phase...

588
00:46:39,763 --> 00:46:41,628
...of the final phase.

589
00:46:44,868 --> 00:46:47,302
I believe that your hopes
will soon come to fruition.

590
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,074
I'm sorry,
this is an inquiry from the Ministry.

591
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:00,844
Araceli will see you out.

592
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:05,977
- So we have a deal.
- If the Lord is willing.

593
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:07,982
Buenas tardes.

594
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:29,342
You must forgive us, madame.

595
00:47:30,147 --> 00:47:36,211
But here we don't accept
American Express for our children.

596
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:43,115
But there is a cash machine
in the lobby.

597
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:46,823
Ministry of Human Services,
please, the Director.

598
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:48,530
Attorney Buendia calling.

599
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:56,631
You'll never get one
of our precious children...

600
00:47:57,007 --> 00:47:59,635
even if you torture me to death.

601
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:02,407
Gonzalo, how are you?

602
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:03,971
Buendia here.

603
00:48:04,948 --> 00:48:10,011
Listen, buddy,
I've got a big favor to ask you.

604
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:33,103
I'm allowed to visit the kids...

605
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:37,711
but only if her sister is there
in the room with us.

606
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:41,515
She doesn't trust me one bit.

607
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:45,585
Before, I would have flipped out.

608
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:47,048
But now...

609
00:48:48,892 --> 00:48:52,089
now I try to think
before I say anything stupid.

610
00:48:52,996 --> 00:48:53,985
That's all.

611
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,267
Thank you, Wilfredo.

612
00:49:01,071 --> 00:49:02,629
And now, our visitor.

613
00:49:03,307 --> 00:49:05,207
Would you like to say something?

614
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:20,051
I don't know how many of y'all
are gonna understand this,

615
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:24,423
but my name is Gayle,
and I'm an alcoholic.

616
00:49:27,164 --> 00:49:29,257
You figure they had
a lot of hangings here?

617
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:33,064
Burnings at the stake,
your basic Inquisition-type stuff.

618
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:35,969
They had the Inquisition
over here, too?

619
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:38,633
Sure. It just happened
a few years later.

620
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:41,337
Kinda like The Beatles
coming to America.

621
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:49,650
Are you religious?

622
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:51,779
Not really.

623
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:55,083
For the interview,
I said I was Ethical Culture.

624
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:56,250
What's that?

625
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,794
If you're Jewish,
it's like the last resort...

626
00:49:58,862 --> 00:50:02,525
Orthodox, Reformed,
Unitarian, Ethical Culture.

627
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:04,794
Gayle is heavy-duty born again.

628
00:50:04,868 --> 00:50:06,893
She's not obnoxious about it, though.

629
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:09,962
She doesn't, you know, proselytize.

630
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,667
Oh, that's how you say that.

631
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:13,670
As far as I know.

632
00:50:16,313 --> 00:50:18,975
Are you gonna send Rebecca...

633
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:21,381
Are you gonna send her
to public schools?

634
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:24,352
Sure, send her off
with crayons and a flak vest.

635
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:26,321
- I'm serious.
- So am I.

636
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:29,791
She's gonna have to bump up
against the real world at some point.

637
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:32,786
This thing where they're
interviewing four-year-olds

638
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:35,661
to get them into the right daycare,
so they get into the right prep school,

639
00:50:35,732 --> 00:50:37,359
so they can get into
Yale early admissions?

640
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:40,267
It costs a fortune,
but it is your kid's future.

641
00:50:40,337 --> 00:50:43,898
I figure if she doesn't absolutely
despise me by the eighth grade,

642
00:50:43,974 --> 00:50:45,202
I'm ahead of the game.

643
00:50:46,576 --> 00:50:50,137
At first the Spaniards
was inside these walls

644
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:52,875
and our people was outside.

645
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:57,784
Then the great general Jose
de San Martin arrived with his army,

646
00:50:57,854 --> 00:51:00,755
and the Spaniards were beaten.

647
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:06,262
Thousands of people
was losing their life.

648
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:08,559
I thought you weren't a guide.

649
00:51:09,332 --> 00:51:12,267
I was in school for some years.

650
00:51:12,335 --> 00:51:15,202
This is our history. I have brought
my children here to show them.

651
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:17,263
How many children do you have?

652
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:21,208
Graciela, Eugenio, y Marisol.

653
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:22,711
Are they in school?

654
00:51:22,779 --> 00:51:25,270
When it's possible, yes.

655
00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:28,511
May I ask you,
which of the United States

656
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:31,349
you are living in?

657
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:33,912
D.C.

658
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:38,290
That's where the White House is.
Actually, it's not a state, it's a district.

659
00:51:38,995 --> 00:51:42,055
Also, we have a place
in Rhode Island.

660
00:51:42,132 --> 00:51:43,861
The smallest of them all.

661
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,300
I'm from Colorado.

662
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,030
- Have you ever visited?
- No.

663
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,971
But I have a great desire to do this.

664
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:54,704
Do you know
this city of Philadelphia?

665
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:56,006
Sure.

666
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:59,674
Someday I would like
to find a job there.

667
00:51:59,749 --> 00:52:03,378
- Why in Philadelphia?
- It's the Cradle of Liberty.

668
00:52:07,224 --> 00:52:10,318
I'll show you
where a dangerous piracy

669
00:52:10,393 --> 00:52:13,920
was driven to the sea.

670
00:52:13,997 --> 00:52:15,055
This way.

671
00:52:18,902 --> 00:52:22,804
Do you think he'd be insulted
if I gave him more than four dollars?

672
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:31,637
Is my son good for anything?

673
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,277
He's still very young.

674
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:37,475
Young?

675
00:52:38,221 --> 00:52:39,518
He's past thirty.

676
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:42,625
Age isn't just years.

677
00:52:46,796 --> 00:52:48,764
Children are a curse.

678
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:50,797
I know. We've got eight.

679
00:52:51,535 --> 00:52:54,265
Eight! How do you support them?

680
00:52:55,238 --> 00:52:57,263
With great difficulty, ma'am.

681
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:04,610
His father gets mixed up
in politics, goes into exile.

682
00:53:04,881 --> 00:53:07,315
I thought all that was over.

683
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:11,446
First the government
wanted to kill him, now I do.

684
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:17,217
Living with a Spanish girl
who's half his age, right?

685
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:19,725
The man is totally shameless.

686
00:53:20,564 --> 00:53:22,361
Off playing the fool...

687
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:26,497
while I'm stuck with these...

688
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:29,566
whining mothers

689
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:32,899
and all the bills to pay!

690
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:36,807
Men get mixed up in politics
like it's no big deal.

691
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:42,817
Then get the military pissed off.

692
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:46,821
And who's left to order the linens?

693
00:56:21,111 --> 00:56:24,979
This is better on my table,
but it's too bulky to bring down.

694
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,640
I'm okay.

695
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:34,785
Are you manipulating my aura?

696
00:56:36,025 --> 00:56:37,720
Something like that.

697
00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:41,459
You have to see
where the hot spots are,

698
00:56:41,531 --> 00:56:43,226
where the energy polarizes.

699
00:56:49,172 --> 00:56:51,333
That really deep stuff is sort of...

700
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:54,669
Don't worry,
I don't do anything too intense.

701
00:57:10,894 --> 00:57:12,919
I think I feel something.

702
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:15,962
There's quite a knot in here.

703
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,461
Something emotional.

704
00:57:25,642 --> 00:57:29,339
- Do you do this on children?
- Sometimes.

705
00:57:29,412 --> 00:57:33,348
They get most of what they need
from, you know, handling.

706
00:57:40,356 --> 00:57:41,983
Do you think that they can tell

707
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:44,788
if it's not their real mother
that's holding them?

708
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,119
You're gonna be the real mother.

709
00:57:57,740 --> 00:57:59,708
If I were to breastfeed...

710
00:58:02,245 --> 00:58:05,942
The idea of letting
someone else's suck on me.

711
00:58:11,187 --> 00:58:14,020
I guess I'm not that maternal.

712
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:15,853
You're not a mother yet.

713
00:58:17,026 --> 00:58:20,291
Now visualize an emotional state

714
00:58:20,363 --> 00:58:24,026
and try to send it all
to one specific part of your body.

715
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:26,591
- Like?
- Why don't we try anxiety?

716
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:30,428
How'd you come up with that one?

717
00:58:31,441 --> 00:58:32,999
Try to put it all here.

718
00:58:46,556 --> 00:58:53,052
Do you think Henley's
too much of a load? As a name?

719
00:58:53,129 --> 00:58:55,154
Names aren't so important.

720
00:58:56,065 --> 00:58:59,000
He's just not gonna look
anything like his father,

721
00:58:59,068 --> 00:59:03,095
and to have this whole
"junior" thing laid on him...

722
00:59:03,907 --> 00:59:06,432
Your husband
must feel strongly about it.

723
00:59:07,477 --> 00:59:10,935
Well, we looked through a name book.

724
00:59:11,848 --> 00:59:13,713
We both really liked Joshua.

725
00:59:16,185 --> 00:59:18,585
There's way too many of those.

726
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:20,850
We had a Joshua.

727
00:59:20,924 --> 00:59:22,858
You had a little boy?

728
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:28,490
The first one was gonna be Cody
if it was a girl, which it was.

729
00:59:29,265 --> 00:59:32,166
I was young enough.
We didn't ask for an amnio.

730
00:59:33,002 --> 00:59:34,970
And you miscarried.

731
00:59:39,509 --> 00:59:43,240
I've read that...
sometimes they end,

732
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:46,805
and the mother didn't even know
she was pregnant.

733
00:59:47,317 --> 00:59:49,808
This was in the last trimester.

734
00:59:49,886 --> 00:59:51,854
Oh, God.

735
00:59:52,822 --> 00:59:54,312
That's terrible.

736
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:59,020
They said she,
they knew it was a she by then,

737
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:02,895
"She's not gonna be viable.
You'll have to carry to term."

738
01:00:03,733 --> 01:00:05,223
So you had...

739
01:00:05,301 --> 01:00:09,169
It was like a delivery,
but without the same spirit.

740
01:00:09,672 --> 01:00:12,038
Nobody brings a video camera.

741
01:00:14,344 --> 01:00:17,575
And with Joshua?

742
01:00:18,648 --> 01:00:21,583
He was born with his lungs
not properly formed,

743
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:25,815
and with Gabriel,
it was his heart. Turn over.

744
01:00:25,888 --> 01:00:27,116
There was another one?

745
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:43,135
Gabriel.

746
01:00:47,443 --> 01:00:49,934
- Did they both...
- Lived.

747
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:55,147
Joshua lived about two days,

748
01:00:55,218 --> 01:00:58,551
and Gabriel hung on
for a whole week.

749
01:00:59,188 --> 01:01:00,780
They were incredible.

750
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:04,452
You're not drinking enough water.

751
01:01:04,527 --> 01:01:06,825
- What?
- Your kidneys.

752
01:01:06,896 --> 01:01:09,296
This tells me
you're not flushing well.

753
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:15,260
How...

754
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:17,833
I can't...

755
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:21,039
How do you get past that?

756
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:26,012
Losing...

757
01:01:27,417 --> 01:01:30,978
...losing three babies.

758
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,887
Imagine that you're made of light

759
01:01:39,962 --> 01:01:44,831
and that you're spreading
outward into a black sky.

760
01:01:46,169 --> 01:01:47,261
Lie down.

761
01:02:16,933 --> 01:02:18,958
Excuse me.
With your permission.

762
01:02:19,035 --> 01:02:23,301
No, come on in.
You can work around me.

763
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:34,842
I'm writing to relatives
in Ireland... big family?

764
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:39,020
Me, too. How many?

765
01:02:40,356 --> 01:02:41,687
How many?

766
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:45,524
Five brothers, four sisters.

767
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:47,119
There's nine of us.

768
01:02:48,397 --> 01:02:50,365
Old-fashioned Catholic, I guess.

769
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:52,094
There were six of us.

770
01:02:52,902 --> 01:02:55,427
Three older brothers,
but two are dead now.

771
01:02:56,205 --> 01:02:58,571
And I take care of the little ones.

772
01:02:59,375 --> 01:03:02,742
Whoever this little girl is
that I'm getting, my daughter,

773
01:03:02,812 --> 01:03:05,110
she's got a roomful of cousins.

774
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:08,280
My daughter.

775
01:03:12,021 --> 01:03:13,352
Listen to me.

776
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:16,885
Don't think I've called her that before.

777
01:03:18,995 --> 01:03:21,020
Do you speak any English?

778
01:03:29,939 --> 01:03:32,066
It's pretty weird, you know.

779
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:37,576
Because you have no idea
of who it is you're getting, really.

780
01:03:39,115 --> 01:03:45,816
But you can't help have
these ideas, these... fantasies.

781
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:57,165
I have this day in my head.

782
01:03:58,134 --> 01:03:59,965
And I used to daydream it

783
01:04:00,036 --> 01:04:02,402
even when I thought
I could have my own kids.

784
01:04:04,473 --> 01:04:06,168
It's early winter...

785
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:10,044
...and there's snow.

786
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:14,108
We get some serious winters
in Boston.

787
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:16,811
You don't have snow
down here, do you?

788
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:19,176
Snow?

789
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:23,116
A snowfall.

790
01:04:23,726 --> 01:04:25,626
Like the state, right?

791
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:29,153
It's a day when there's no school.
It's a snow day.

792
01:04:30,233 --> 01:04:31,757
And I let her sleep late.

793
01:04:32,835 --> 01:04:35,269
And she's little,
but she's old enough to go to school.

794
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:37,169
She's third grade, maybe.

795
01:04:39,909 --> 01:04:41,638
And I let her sleep late.

796
01:04:43,512 --> 01:04:49,849
I come in, and she's this
little, warm bump in the bed.

797
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:57,652
And I say, "Darling, it's a snow day.
I'm gonna let you sleep."

798
01:04:58,694 --> 01:05:00,889
You enjoy it more if you know
you're getting extra,

799
01:05:00,963 --> 01:05:03,227
that usually you'd be up
and brushing your teeth.

800
01:05:05,501 --> 01:05:09,733
Finally, she gets up
and she comes out in her pajamas,

801
01:05:09,805 --> 01:05:11,705
and I make her cocoa with...

802
01:05:11,774 --> 01:05:14,538
you know those little
marshmallows on the top?

803
01:05:16,212 --> 01:05:19,443
And then we talk about
what we're gonna do that day.

804
01:05:20,716 --> 01:05:23,685
And you can hear the snow shovels
outside crunching.

805
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:27,484
The plows rumble by every
once in a while, scraping the streets,

806
01:05:27,556 --> 01:05:31,287
and it's still falling, so it stays
clean on top of everything, white.

807
01:05:32,795 --> 01:05:35,787
Then I get her dressed...
all the layers.

808
01:05:35,865 --> 01:05:38,891
Although now it's a lot less
with the polar fleece.

809
01:05:39,802 --> 01:05:41,895
And she can do most of it herself,

810
01:05:41,971 --> 01:05:45,634
but you help
because it's a pleasure.

811
01:05:46,676 --> 01:05:51,511
Her arm on your neck
while she balances to put her boots on.

812
01:05:52,348 --> 01:05:56,580
No thought of it.
You're just an extension of her body.

813
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:08,086
We go to the Common,
or we go way out to Jamaica Pond,

814
01:06:08,164 --> 01:06:09,688
depending on the weather.

815
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:14,035
And she's just bold enough to skid out
away from me a little bit.

816
01:06:14,103 --> 01:06:18,506
Shaky, but she keeps looking back
to see if I'm watching her.

817
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:22,133
She always comes back
to lean on me and rest.

818
01:06:23,846 --> 01:06:27,043
And there's zillions of kids,
and they're all ages.

819
01:06:27,116 --> 01:06:30,108
They're zipping around
and that makes her really excited,

820
01:06:30,186 --> 01:06:32,882
but mostly,
she just wants to be with me.

821
01:06:32,955 --> 01:06:34,946
Just the two of us.

822
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:44,797
And then later, when I take her
to Shakey's or Ground Round,

823
01:06:44,867 --> 01:06:48,963
whatever seems like a big treat to her,
and I let her order french fries,

824
01:06:49,038 --> 01:06:50,869
as long as she
has some of my soup, too,

825
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:54,239
and she tells me stories
about her classmates,

826
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:57,006
or she tells me stories
that she's made up, or...

827
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:01,074
...whatever.

828
01:07:03,953 --> 01:07:06,421
We sit and we talk in the booth.

829
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:10,822
And we're surrounded
by other mothers and their kids.

830
01:07:12,762 --> 01:07:15,697
And I am just one of them, you know?

831
01:07:22,438 --> 01:07:23,962
And then later...

832
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:30,145
...when we walk home
from wherever I can park the car...

833
01:07:31,614 --> 01:07:35,209
...there is the sound of our feet
on the new snow...

834
01:07:36,752 --> 01:07:39,277
...her taking two steps to my one.

835
01:07:41,557 --> 01:07:45,857
Then maybe if they haven't shoveled
the walk, like they usually don't...

836
01:07:47,396 --> 01:07:51,093
...I go in front,
to break the way for her.

837
01:07:57,473 --> 01:08:02,103
This is ignoring the fact that
I am supposed to be at work, right?

838
01:08:03,879 --> 01:08:05,813
I'm the one with the job.

839
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:22,488
I have a little girl up North.

840
01:08:26,302 --> 01:08:28,099
I named her Esmeralda.

841
01:08:30,539 --> 01:08:33,667
She'll be four years old
on the ninth of April.

842
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:37,736
Maybe she lives where it snows.

843
01:08:38,747 --> 01:08:39,873
Who knows?

844
01:08:44,753 --> 01:08:46,118
I was so young.

845
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:53,960
I had to take care of
my brother and sister. I had to work.

846
01:08:56,765 --> 01:08:58,232
The nuns...

847
01:09:00,903 --> 01:09:02,564
they came to see me.

848
01:09:08,344 --> 01:09:09,743
They said that...

849
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:13,378
it would be best to give her up.

850
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:23,091
Sometimes when
a new group of mothers comes,

851
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:25,827
I pick one.

852
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:28,759
A good one.

853
01:09:31,634 --> 01:09:33,124
I try to...

854
01:09:35,938 --> 01:09:37,803
imagine her face,

855
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:40,665
her voice.

856
01:09:43,312 --> 01:09:45,610
When I think of Esmeralda

857
01:09:46,715 --> 01:09:49,809
with her other mother
up there in the North,

858
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:56,249
I hope that my little girl...

859
01:09:57,126 --> 01:09:59,594
has found a mother like you.

860
01:10:02,965 --> 01:10:06,264
I didn't get any of it.

861
01:10:06,835 --> 01:10:07,824
Excuse me.

862
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:13,205
I'm sorry.

863
01:11:02,591 --> 01:11:03,580
Reynaldo.

864
01:11:05,761 --> 01:11:06,750
Celia.

865
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:11,755
What's up?

866
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:14,091
Nothing much.

867
01:11:18,207 --> 01:11:20,334
Zoila said you were looking for me,

868
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:23,210
with some big news.

869
01:11:24,713 --> 01:11:26,340
Zoila doesn't know shit.

870
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:32,550
You still hanging at the beach?

871
01:11:33,055 --> 01:11:34,886
No, I've had...

872
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:37,452
I've been sick.

873
01:11:39,228 --> 01:11:40,217
Better now?

874
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:43,295
It'll be over soon.

875
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:48,125
Great.

876
01:11:51,507 --> 01:11:52,940
We're going to Miami.

877
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:54,940
Who knows how long.

878
01:11:55,744 --> 01:11:58,542
What do they have in Miami
we don't have here?

879
01:11:58,614 --> 01:12:01,412
It's 'cause
my mother's old-fashioned

880
01:12:01,684 --> 01:12:03,982
and has to drag me everywhere.

881
01:12:06,855 --> 01:12:08,152
You look different.

882
01:12:18,867 --> 01:12:19,891
The boss.

883
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:24,499
See you around.

884
01:12:30,979 --> 01:12:32,139
I don't think so.

885
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:38,277
Who'd you rob to get this?

886
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:39,878
What's it to you?

887
01:12:39,955 --> 01:12:41,889
There's not enough left
to buy doughnuts.

888
01:12:41,957 --> 01:12:42,946
Forget about it.

889
01:12:45,227 --> 01:12:46,819
Little shits.

890
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:51,192
I brought these.

891
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:56,159
They'll do.

892
01:12:57,172 --> 01:12:59,299
A passport costs forty thousand...

893
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:01,036
with a birth certificate, too,
it's sixty thousand.

894
01:13:02,845 --> 01:13:04,710
- And the plane ticket?
- That depends.

895
01:13:05,013 --> 01:13:08,210
Toronto, Chicago, New York, Miami,
it's riskier but you get there.

896
01:13:08,584 --> 01:13:10,518
If you want to fly to Mexico
and cross the border...

897
01:13:10,819 --> 01:13:12,013
And Philadelphia?

898
01:13:12,321 --> 01:13:14,289
No direct flights to Philadelphia.

899
01:13:17,526 --> 01:13:20,723
Is there a way I can pay half now
and owe the rest?

900
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:24,532
What do I look like?
Come back when you can pay.

901
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:15,341
One, two, three generations
without a father...

902
01:14:15,417 --> 01:14:17,851
or with one who's
unemployed or in jail.

903
01:14:18,487 --> 01:14:22,856
Children need role models.
They need a dream to follow.

904
01:14:23,926 --> 01:14:27,020
Instead we have
this permanent despair,

905
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:31,024
kids growing up with no concept

906
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:33,800
of work or responsibility.

907
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:38,903
This is why I won't go out
on the streets alone after dark.

908
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:42,936
Sure, there were excesses
in the past,

909
01:14:43,245 --> 01:14:46,408
but when I was a girl,
we had a sense of dignity.

910
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:47,949
Now, this is more like it.

911
01:14:48,016 --> 01:14:50,348
How many stars are next to this
in the guidebook?

912
01:14:50,419 --> 01:14:52,785
We'll be fine as long as you
don't get into the wine list.

913
01:14:52,855 --> 01:14:54,982
- I'm treating.
- Come on.

914
01:14:55,057 --> 01:14:56,149
No, I want to.

915
01:14:56,225 --> 01:14:57,920
- No...
- I don't... no.

916
01:15:01,029 --> 01:15:03,589
- One last drink and that's it.
- It's ridiculous.

917
01:15:04,533 --> 01:15:06,160
- Nobody here wants them.
- And why not?

918
01:15:06,468 --> 01:15:08,561
Because they've fucked us
from every angle...

919
01:15:08,637 --> 01:15:12,539
economically, psychologically,
politically.

920
01:15:12,608 --> 01:15:14,405
It's more than just them.

921
01:15:15,878 --> 01:15:17,812
Another round, please!

922
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:20,849
Imagine our lives
if they just disappeared.

923
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:22,908
How come they need so many?

924
01:15:23,485 --> 01:15:25,282
Can't they breed their own?

925
01:15:26,822 --> 01:15:32,124
They're too busy making money
to procreate.

926
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:33,957
Or maybe it's their technology.

927
01:15:34,830 --> 01:15:36,855
I don't trust those microwaves.

928
01:15:37,399 --> 01:15:39,924
It's just another form
of cultural imperialism.

929
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:43,171
We supply the raw material
and they refine it.

930
01:15:43,805 --> 01:15:46,035
You think they'd let us
bring their kids here?

931
01:15:46,341 --> 01:15:49,139
- Lots of opportunity up there.
- For whites only.

932
01:15:52,648 --> 01:15:56,482
Hector, my Cuban friend,

933
01:15:56,752 --> 01:16:00,119
he was in Panama
when they kidnapped Noriega.

934
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:02,152
Too bad they didn't kill him.

935
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:03,282
And he told me

936
01:16:03,825 --> 01:16:06,623
that the Yankee invaders...

937
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:10,198
were from every race!

938
01:16:10,265 --> 01:16:13,462
Chinese, Latinos, Blacks, Whites.

939
01:16:14,002 --> 01:16:15,867
Exactly my point.

940
01:16:16,171 --> 01:16:19,163
- That's where I'm heading!
- That's what I'm saying, too!

941
01:16:19,441 --> 01:16:20,601
If it comes to a showdown...

942
01:16:20,676 --> 01:16:23,804
the little bastards shooting at us
will be our own.

943
01:16:26,615 --> 01:16:31,712
An order of cheese empanadas
for two...

944
01:16:33,121 --> 01:16:34,383
chicken soup...

945
01:16:36,458 --> 01:16:39,222
roast pork with rice.

946
01:16:43,765 --> 01:16:45,733
And two margaritas.

947
01:16:45,801 --> 01:16:47,325
Les.

948
01:16:48,403 --> 01:16:49,927
I'm sorry, I forgot.

949
01:16:50,005 --> 01:16:50,994
I'm sorry.

950
01:16:54,576 --> 01:16:58,410
Make that one margarita
and one pina colada

951
01:16:59,381 --> 01:17:00,370
without rum.

952
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:02,742
Without rum.

953
01:17:07,889 --> 01:17:08,981
Twenty minutes.

954
01:17:09,758 --> 01:17:11,919
I'll start timing them in half an hour.

955
01:17:11,994 --> 01:17:13,120
No big hurry.

956
01:17:14,062 --> 01:17:16,530
Do you think the others
think we're being anti-social?

957
01:17:16,598 --> 01:17:20,398
There's no rule that says
we have to do everything in a group.

958
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:23,700
Of course, if the dog lady
and Miss Triathlon weren't here...

959
01:17:23,772 --> 01:17:25,569
Skipper is a good person.

960
01:17:26,341 --> 01:17:28,571
You cut people a lot of slack.

961
01:17:31,913 --> 01:17:33,471
It's just her...

962
01:17:34,683 --> 01:17:37,811
...her exterior is a bit intimidating.

963
01:17:41,923 --> 01:17:46,292
Did you order the cheese thingies,
the turnovers?

964
01:17:46,361 --> 01:17:47,487
But of course.

965
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:54,928
I eat any more cheese,
I might never poop again.

966
01:17:55,637 --> 01:17:58,071
- I got the opposite problem.
- Still?

967
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:01,041
I know the location
of every flush toilet in South America.

968
01:18:14,022 --> 01:18:16,490
Their stuff is worse than our stuff.

969
01:18:16,558 --> 01:18:18,856
I just wish I could speak it like you do.

970
01:18:18,927 --> 01:18:21,657
You don't need to understand
the words to watch TV.

971
01:18:21,730 --> 01:18:24,164
Stupidity is the universal language.

972
01:18:32,674 --> 01:18:36,940
She was
a Communications major... Nan.

973
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:41,710
- That's news.
- At Kansas State.

974
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:47,451
She told me she went to
the University of Missouri,

975
01:18:47,522 --> 01:18:49,251
majored in Political Science.

976
01:18:53,228 --> 01:18:56,391
What did she tell you
her husband does for a living?

977
01:18:57,766 --> 01:18:58,790
Engineer.

978
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:05,096
High school chemistry teacher.

979
01:19:05,173 --> 01:19:06,299
You're kidding.

980
01:19:07,242 --> 01:19:08,607
"They get through a year
with my George,

981
01:19:08,677 --> 01:19:11,475
they know that periodic table
backwards and forwards."

982
01:19:11,546 --> 01:19:12,911
Wow.

983
01:19:14,783 --> 01:19:17,946
If I tell you something,
you promise not to pass it on?

984
01:19:18,019 --> 01:19:21,147
- Only if it's really juicy.
- She steals.

985
01:19:24,359 --> 01:19:25,417
Steals what?

986
01:19:26,828 --> 01:19:29,558
Off the maids' carts.

987
01:19:29,631 --> 01:19:34,568
I've seen her take a half dozen
of those shampoos, soaps,

988
01:19:34,636 --> 01:19:37,764
those little mints
they put on our pillow at night.

989
01:19:38,373 --> 01:19:39,533
You're shitting me.

990
01:19:40,475 --> 01:19:42,773
She just fills her pockets with them.

991
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:46,580
I suppose she assumes it's her right.

992
01:19:46,648 --> 01:19:50,982
It's... furtive.

993
01:19:51,052 --> 01:19:53,111
Furtive. I love it.

994
01:19:53,188 --> 01:19:55,918
I was halfway down in the stairs,

995
01:19:55,991 --> 01:19:58,687
so she didn't know I saw her,
but she just looked both ways,

996
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:02,457
and she just dug right in.

997
01:20:03,265 --> 01:20:05,825
And everything is so cheap down here.

998
01:20:05,901 --> 01:20:08,802
She always seems so in control.

999
01:20:08,870 --> 01:20:12,271
Most of your serial killers
are totally methodical.

1000
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:13,773
Come on.

1001
01:20:13,842 --> 01:20:16,310
I know you guys
aren't supposed to dis anybody,

1002
01:20:16,378 --> 01:20:18,903
but you gotta admit,
she's a sociopath.

1003
01:20:19,848 --> 01:20:23,978
- Is that anything like a psychopath?
- With a lower body count, yeah.

1004
01:20:27,289 --> 01:20:30,190
Then why are we letting her
have a child?

1005
01:20:33,628 --> 01:20:36,119
You have to know
how to handle these people.

1006
01:20:36,198 --> 01:20:38,359
They've got an inferiority complex.

1007
01:20:38,433 --> 01:20:40,424
Lord knows
they have reason to have one,

1008
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:43,767
but you have to know
what's bark and what's bite.

1009
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:47,275
You don't think every one of us
couldn't have finished our business

1010
01:20:47,342 --> 01:20:48,900
and been long gone by now?

1011
01:20:48,977 --> 01:20:51,411
They just wanna hold your feet
to the fire a little,

1012
01:20:51,479 --> 01:20:53,208
make the gringos squirm.

1013
01:20:53,281 --> 01:20:57,809
That's exactly how I felt when they were
doing all that fertility testing.

1014
01:20:57,886 --> 01:21:01,413
Like they were making up new stuff
just to try on me.

1015
01:21:01,489 --> 01:21:02,786
I had two operations.

1016
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:06,294
One was a tubal ligation
and this other thing.

1017
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:08,420
I never totally understood the point.

1018
01:21:08,496 --> 01:21:10,657
- Nothing, right?
- It must work for somebody.

1019
01:21:10,732 --> 01:21:12,529
It works for the doctors.

1020
01:21:12,601 --> 01:21:15,297
You don't wanna know
what those bastards put me through.

1021
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:18,430
They had me on this stuff
with nun's pee in it.

1022
01:21:18,506 --> 01:21:21,964
- Is this a regular doctor?
- Italian nun's pee?

1023
01:21:22,043 --> 01:21:24,136
It has some kind of a hormone?

1024
01:21:24,212 --> 01:21:27,340
From women of a certain age
who haven't been sexually active.

1025
01:21:27,415 --> 01:21:30,248
- I've read about it.
- It's a racket.

1026
01:21:30,318 --> 01:21:34,254
They tried to talk my George
into some business with his gonads.

1027
01:21:34,322 --> 01:21:36,722
I thought he was
going to choke the intern.

1028
01:21:37,759 --> 01:21:42,355
Here we go.
London broil, baked potato.

1029
01:21:43,598 --> 01:21:45,429
I think we scored, ladies.

1030
01:21:46,234 --> 01:21:49,294
- We could say something.
- To who?

1031
01:21:49,371 --> 01:21:52,704
- To the people at the agency down here.
- That would go down real well.

1032
01:21:52,774 --> 01:21:56,266
"In light of the persistent and malicious
disappearance of our pillow mints,

1033
01:21:56,344 --> 01:21:57,538
we the undersigned..."

1034
01:21:57,612 --> 01:21:59,341
So what do we do?

1035
01:22:03,451 --> 01:22:04,509
I don't know.

1036
01:22:07,155 --> 01:22:09,055
Be really good mothers to ours.

1037
01:22:10,558 --> 01:22:12,617
Pray for Rosemary's baby.

1038
01:22:12,694 --> 01:22:15,663
- This is serious.
- I know.

1039
01:22:15,730 --> 01:22:17,595
It's life, though.

1040
01:22:18,566 --> 01:22:21,467
Do you know how many manuscripts
we get submitted every year

1041
01:22:21,536 --> 01:22:24,596
where the basic story
is the mom's a fruitcake?

1042
01:22:25,307 --> 01:22:26,899
It's a whole genre.

1043
01:22:28,743 --> 01:22:32,736
So, we're what,
afraid to rock the boat,

1044
01:22:32,814 --> 01:22:34,679
get the ministry riled up,

1045
01:22:34,749 --> 01:22:37,741
throw a little hitch
into that adoption schedule?

1046
01:22:40,021 --> 01:22:42,649
We just don't like her, that's all.

1047
01:22:43,591 --> 01:22:46,321
The kid, whoever it is, will survive.

1048
01:22:53,735 --> 01:22:55,498
Where we gonna sleep tonight?

1049
01:22:55,570 --> 01:22:56,935
Don't worry about that.

1050
01:22:57,706 --> 01:22:58,695
Put it here.

1051
01:23:03,244 --> 01:23:06,042
Gold is the best. Gold and silver.

1052
01:23:09,584 --> 01:23:10,573
None for me?

1053
01:23:11,987 --> 01:23:13,249
Maybe a little bit. Later.

1054
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:40,641
Crabs and Goats...

1055
01:23:41,349 --> 01:23:45,251
very soon you may realize
your forgotten dreams.

1056
01:23:46,621 --> 01:23:48,316
And for our Twins.
it's best to lay low...

1057
01:23:48,623 --> 01:23:51,615
Tonight you can be the big winner
in the National Lottery...

1058
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:55,595
Here's Lady Luck herself...

1059
01:23:55,663 --> 01:23:59,531
Miss Esperanza Natividad.

1060
01:24:02,337 --> 01:24:04,635
Virgo never needs to say
she's sorry.

1061
01:24:04,906 --> 01:24:06,999
Scorpions will enter
a period of stress...

1062
01:24:07,308 --> 01:24:10,471
especially if they try to rise
to a higher level.

1063
01:24:14,516 --> 01:24:15,505
Lions...

1064
01:24:17,519 --> 01:24:19,214
should never live with Fish.

1065
01:24:21,856 --> 01:24:25,690
Remember that the race
goes not always to the swiftest...

1066
01:24:26,327 --> 01:24:29,387
and that youth is the land
of the possibility.

1067
01:24:31,366 --> 01:24:32,856
The Road of Knowledge...

1068
01:24:33,168 --> 01:24:36,296
is blocked by the prejudice
of the smug.

1069
01:24:37,605 --> 01:24:41,302
And to follow the crowd
is to lose your way.

1070
01:26:23,344 --> 01:26:24,333
Aquarians...

1071
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:27,910
it's time for reflection...

1072
01:26:30,652 --> 01:26:34,952
to learn the lessons of the past
and apply them to the future.

1073
01:26:36,324 --> 01:26:38,792
On the other hand. Libra...

1074
01:26:40,361 --> 01:26:45,993
expect a change that will
turn your life upside down.

1075
01:26:47,402 --> 01:26:50,030
I see irreversible events...

1076
01:26:51,172 --> 01:26:55,268
grave warnings
in the movement of the planets.

1077
01:26:57,478 --> 01:27:01,107
We must obseve their orbits
with caution.

1078
01:27:02,517 --> 01:27:07,386
There are forces in life
we can neither explain nor control.

1079
01:27:07,855 --> 01:27:11,518
Our fotune is not accidental...

1080
01:27:12,493 --> 01:27:17,294
but a confluence of energy.
negative or positive.

1081
01:27:20,935 --> 01:27:23,631
Great days are coming!

1082
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:27,800
You have unlimited potential.

1083
01:27:30,612 --> 01:27:32,170
We must remember...

1084
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:35,572
that life offers
as many oppotunities

1085
01:27:36,117 --> 01:27:38,244
as there are stars in the sky.

1086
01:27:40,955 --> 01:27:43,082
The Heavens
don't determine our destiny.

1087
01:27:43,891 --> 01:27:47,156
but if we listen carefully
to their signals.

1088
01:27:48,863 --> 01:27:51,195
we can smile at tomorrow!

1089
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:41,440
Hey, look, buy this from me.

1090
01:29:42,677 --> 01:29:44,440
Look, I'm selling, I'm selling...

1091
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:47,707
a book, please. It's about a goat.

1092
01:29:48,649 --> 01:29:51,880
Look, I'm selling a book.
It's really interesting, about a goat.

1093
01:29:52,186 --> 01:29:54,950
Sir, I'm selling a book.
Please, sir.

1094
01:30:05,700 --> 01:30:06,894
It's really cheap!

1095
01:30:19,747 --> 01:30:22,614
Eileen Mulroney.
I got here as soon as I could.

1096
01:30:22,683 --> 01:30:24,150
The traffic was...

1097
01:30:24,218 --> 01:30:25,378
Have a seat, please.

1098
01:30:31,826 --> 01:30:33,225
You, too?

1099
01:30:34,429 --> 01:30:37,421
- Looks like it.
- That's great.

1100
01:30:37,498 --> 01:30:40,467
- Congratulations.
- Likewise.

1101
01:30:52,547 --> 01:30:54,572
I left mine at the hotel.

1102
01:30:55,383 --> 01:30:56,782
Be my guest.

1103
01:30:59,554 --> 01:31:00,680
Thanks.

1104
01:31:01,656 --> 01:31:03,283
It was so sudden.

1105
01:31:07,495 --> 01:31:10,555
- I had a pretty good idea.
- You did?

1106
01:31:10,631 --> 01:31:13,395
I lit a fire under my lawyer
yesterday.

1107
01:31:14,802 --> 01:31:17,327
- Spread some money around.
- Really?

1108
01:31:18,206 --> 01:31:19,730
Got their attention.

1109
01:31:26,380 --> 01:31:28,371
Put in a good word for you, too.

1110
01:31:32,620 --> 01:31:33,951
Thank you.

1111
01:31:49,103 --> 01:31:52,266
In two minutes,
my life will never be the same.

1112
01:32:02,984 --> 01:32:05,316
Her name's going to be Esmeralda.

1113
01:32:06,954 --> 01:32:08,444
Did I tell you that?

1114
01:32:12,894 --> 01:32:15,362
Who knows what lies ahead for you?

1115
01:32:16,063 --> 01:32:18,657
Maybe a wonderful life.

1116
01:32:19,467 --> 01:32:20,456
Ready.

1117
01:32:22,003 --> 01:32:23,493
Good luck, my love.
