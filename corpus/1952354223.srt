1
00:01:05,581 --> 00:01:09,373
I will always remember the
I first saw the Redwoods.

2
00:01:11,987 --> 00:01:15,556
That was the day
that my life began.

3
00:01:45,954 --> 00:01:48,126
Someone is ready to... go!

4
00:01:54,087 --> 00:01:55,018
Good morning.

5
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,054
Go get dressed Billy.

6
00:03:52,596 --> 00:03:54,156
Your grandparents will wonder:

7
00:03:54,156 --> 00:03:57,212
"Who is this handsome guy?

8
00:03:57,733 --> 00:03:59,414
• You are so grown!?

9
00:03:59,971 --> 00:04:01,775
• You can not be Billy...
or can?

10
00:04:02,271 --> 00:04:04,319
"O my God, really?!

11
00:04:04,487 --> 00:04:05,549
? It's Billy!?

12
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:07,821
We need shaving cream?

13
00:04:08,834 --> 00:04:12,009
In the closet
store room next to the toothpaste.

14
00:04:14,892 --> 00:04:16,120
And you know what?

15
00:04:16,581 --> 00:04:21,852
There will be enormous,
really huge ship in Seattle.

16
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:23,953
What do you think of this?

17
00:04:24,337 --> 00:04:25,668
Billy goes to brush his teeth, dear.

18
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:39,505
You can deal with the mold
shower while we away?

19
00:04:40,954 --> 00:04:42,780
And the brown rust stains on the ceiling.

20
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,548
I'll get disinfectant.

21
00:04:45,282 --> 00:04:51,925
I found them such vouchers, but are
for packages of 26 gallons, not 13.

22
00:04:52,396 --> 00:04:53,844
- The 26 are too large.
- I know.

23
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:00,686
Everett... not so easy to get your nails in the carpet.

24
00:05:02,126 --> 00:05:03,845
- Billy?
- So...

25
00:05:04,415 --> 00:05:07,218
I want to buy
13 gallons without the coupon?

26
00:05:08,059 --> 00:05:10,100
Billy wanted to brush his teeth?

27
00:05:10,574 --> 00:05:11,714
Sorry, you say?

28
00:05:14,634 --> 00:05:15,446
Nothing.

29
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:26,853
Billy?

30
00:05:29,226 --> 00:05:31,990
Its alright
all is well.

31
00:05:33,454 --> 00:05:36,012
I just have
great job this week.

32
00:05:36,762 --> 00:05:39,324
I'll wait for you here...

33
00:05:39,433 --> 00:05:40,703
when you get back.

34
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:43,292
I promise.

35
00:05:44,614 --> 00:05:45,637
We have to go, Billy.

36
00:06:03,312 --> 00:06:05,447
- Do not forget to arrange to have sprinklers.
- Okay.

37
00:06:08,593 --> 00:06:09,842
I'll call you when I get there.

38
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,941
Drive with care.

39
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:21,528
Goodbye.

40
00:06:30,046 --> 00:06:31,432
Come with me and Anna tonight.

41
00:06:32,037 --> 00:06:33,924
Shane No offense, but...

42
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:37,538
Watch straight guys get drunk
is not my definition of fun.

43
00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:40,136
Sometimes we have to make trouble.

44
00:06:42,049 --> 00:06:43,918
You are really good at it.

45
00:06:45,622 --> 00:06:47,055
You know, you're as bad as him.

46
00:06:47,457 --> 00:06:48,507
Actually...

47
00:06:49,258 --> 00:06:51,951
I am desirous of
spend some time alone.

48
00:06:52,516 --> 00:06:55,562
Do not you think...
have been alone long enough?

49
00:08:42,572 --> 00:08:43,302
Hello ..

50
00:08:46,951 --> 00:08:48,040
I'm lost.

51
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,307
Where to?

52
00:08:52,888 --> 00:08:55,125
For Humboldt Bed & Breakfast?

53
00:08:55,362 --> 00:08:57,133
It is in the Humboldt Street, right?

54
00:08:58,819 --> 00:09:00,246
This is the Alameda de Humboldt.

55
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,565
Not so far.

56
00:09:07,558 --> 00:09:10,521
All you have to do
is back on this road...

57
00:09:11,254 --> 00:09:14,873
Can you show me the map?
I am a bit bewildered.

58
00:09:17,282 --> 00:09:18,177
Sure.

59
00:09:21,006 --> 00:09:22,130
Very good.

60
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:24,743
- Sorry to be boring.
- Nothing.

61
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,639
The owner of the place is
a good friend of my mother.

62
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,490
- Bad with directions.
- She was probably drugged.

63
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:34,471
- Really?
- Do not tell her I said that.

64
00:09:35,104 --> 00:09:36,384
Word of scout!

65
00:09:40,353 --> 00:09:42,389
Here's where we are...

66
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,517
- Sorry...
- No, it's a. ..

67
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:54,646
So you have to return to this road here...

68
00:09:55,024 --> 00:09:56,856
and when it's Mayfield...

69
00:09:57,244 --> 00:09:59,593
Mayfield will drive you exactly...

70
00:10:00,026 --> 00:10:01,075
the city.

71
00:10:03,068 --> 00:10:04,465
Yes.

72
00:10:05,436 --> 00:10:07,028
It does not seem very complicated.

73
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:09,342
When in doubt avoid gravel roads.

74
00:10:10,351 --> 00:10:11,191
Good advice.

75
00:10:12,888 --> 00:10:15,656
- By the way, my name is Chase...
- Everett...

76
00:10:16,551 --> 00:10:18,011
Thank you for being so helpful.

77
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,754
I did not do much.

78
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:25,547
Where is it?

79
00:10:28,354 --> 00:10:29,217
Guess...

80
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,505
I'm here to finish a novel.

81
00:10:33,748 --> 00:10:34,977
I hope.

82
00:10:35,276 --> 00:10:36,161
He is a writer.

83
00:10:38,775 --> 00:10:40,301
I aspire to be.

84
00:10:40,561 --> 00:10:41,959
It also aspired...

85
00:10:42,438 --> 00:10:43,798
- In times.
- Really?

86
00:10:45,489 --> 00:10:48,173
It's a long... and very boring story.

87
00:10:49,443 --> 00:10:51,438
I better get back to work.

88
00:10:53,544 --> 00:10:57,255
Yes, yes, I better
find my way into town.

89
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,538
Goodbye Everett.

90
00:11:03,055 --> 00:11:04,099
Goodbye.

91
00:12:01,994 --> 00:12:05,107
This piece was
perfectly in the spare bedroom, but...

92
00:12:05,321 --> 00:12:08,475
your dad would kill me for sure
if I took something home.

93
00:12:10,053 --> 00:12:13,007
It is I who should protest
with all the contraptions of golf.

94
00:12:17,641 --> 00:12:18,429
Are you okay?

95
00:12:20,928 --> 00:12:21,766
Yes.

96
00:12:23,246 --> 00:12:24,585
- What?
- Nothing...

97
00:12:24,804 --> 00:12:26,831
work is crazy at this point.

98
00:12:27,052 --> 00:12:30,647
- It is not even tax season.
- It's always time for taxes.

99
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,963
O my God, are 10 hours.

100
00:12:34,136 --> 00:12:37,287
Gotta go.
I leave you at home?

101
00:12:38,795 --> 00:12:41,671
I. .. I'll stay here a little longer.

102
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,432
You'll stay here?

103
00:12:43,854 --> 00:12:45,820
Do what you want.

104
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,902
Raisins there then?

105
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:19,114
This is a small town.

106
00:13:22,977 --> 00:13:24,806
Do not expect to find you here.

107
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:28,647
I love antique shops.

108
00:13:29,906 --> 00:13:31,667
You should meet my mother.

109
00:13:33,758 --> 00:13:36,454
For your information, dodgy...

110
00:13:38,913 --> 00:13:40,820
I left the store before him.

111
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:47,768
I mean, Wilson, is not it strange
he has not gone to Seattle with Miles?

112
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:50,100
Walk not looking for trouble, Tess.

113
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,097
I do not walk looking for trouble!

114
00:13:59,161 --> 00:14:01,858
All these old pieces
have stories behind, you know?

115
00:14:05,574 --> 00:14:08,378
Imagine the secrets it contained.

116
00:14:12,699 --> 00:14:14,236
You speak as a writer.

117
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:17,464
You never told me what you were doing.

118
00:14:19,569 --> 00:14:24,210
It's so... boring
you probably forgot.

119
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:27,995
I am accountant.

120
00:14:29,092 --> 00:14:30,913
It seems... challenging.

121
00:14:31,898 --> 00:14:34,208
Yes .. allows me to stay home with Billy.

122
00:14:35,623 --> 00:14:36,962
You have a son?

123
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,126
And a partner.

124
00:14:43,453 --> 00:14:46,144
They are... out.

125
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,669
- How long have you been together?
- 8 years.

126
00:14:49,843 --> 00:14:51,829
No. ..

127
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:55,285
seven.

128
00:14:56,254 --> 00:14:57,169
Yes ..

129
00:14:58,409 --> 00:14:59,471
Seven years.

130
00:15:05,015 --> 00:15:05,901
I have...

131
00:15:09,143 --> 00:15:10,712
What are your plans for today?

132
00:15:19,598 --> 00:15:21,630
Everett, what a surprise!

133
00:15:24,344 --> 00:15:26,817
- Behave Didi.
- Never.

134
00:15:27,373 --> 00:15:29,376
You have become fast friends.

135
00:15:33,273 --> 00:15:36,953
The Everett agreed
graciously being my tour guide.

136
00:15:38,862 --> 00:15:40,090
For today.

137
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,050
Lucky.

138
00:15:47,903 --> 00:15:49,902
I know I have to
my camera here somewhere.

139
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:54,662
I. .. I
wait outside if you want.

140
00:15:55,862 --> 00:15:56,905
What? No, come in!

141
00:15:57,309 --> 00:15:58,504
I'll just take a minute.

142
00:16:09,097 --> 00:16:10,616
What about this?

143
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,794
Ring if you want...

144
00:16:19,748 --> 00:16:20,836
I do not know how.

145
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:29,614
Just... blows.

146
00:16:57,921 --> 00:16:59,246
What are you writing?

147
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:03,678
Good question.

148
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,769
It makes you feel so...

149
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:41,242
insignificant.

150
00:17:43,406 --> 00:17:45,741
Some of these trees have been here since...

151
00:17:46,305 --> 00:17:47,528
the time of Christ.

152
00:17:48,578 --> 00:17:50,853
How many things
endure the test of time like this?

153
00:17:51,327 --> 00:17:52,852
Not many, I suppose.

154
00:17:54,566 --> 00:17:55,512
It may take us a picture?

155
00:17:56,025 --> 00:17:57,130
Sure, no problem.

156
00:17:57,817 --> 00:17:59,527
Just press the button.

157
00:17:59,896 --> 00:18:00,737
- See?
- Yes.

158
00:18:03,555 --> 00:18:06,778
- Try to catch as much of the tree as you can.
- I'm not very photogenic.

159
00:18:07,097 --> 00:18:09,014
I doubt it very much.

160
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,227
Ready?

161
00:18:13,921 --> 00:18:15,762
- Nice... already.
- Wait!

162
00:18:16,326 --> 00:18:18,102
You can take one more?

163
00:18:18,553 --> 00:18:19,169
Sure.

164
00:18:19,784 --> 00:18:20,774
No problem.

165
00:18:23,986 --> 00:18:24,626
Perfect.

166
00:18:34,637 --> 00:18:38,331
Peter Pan represented here, in the sixth year.

167
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:40,741
It seems to have been the perfect casting.

168
00:18:46,689 --> 00:18:48,037
I want to read your book.

169
00:18:50,315 --> 00:18:51,532
Are you serious?

170
00:18:52,959 --> 00:18:55,696
I had courses in writing
creative while I was at Stanford.

171
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:58,963
They accepted you Stanford?

172
00:18:59,184 --> 00:19:00,903
Very funny.

173
00:19:03,526 --> 00:19:04,894
Still needs much work.

174
00:19:05,486 --> 00:19:06,631
So?!

175
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,756
You got to lose?

176
00:19:27,532 --> 00:19:30,765
¹ I was born in Faith, North Dakota.
[¹ \u003d Fe]

177
00:19:31,195 --> 00:19:33,133
Population: 800.

178
00:19:33,399 --> 00:19:36,796
The nearest doctor was 218 km.

179
00:19:37,348 --> 00:19:38,671
In Grand Forks.

180
00:19:40,399 --> 00:19:42,547
To my family, Faith was not enough.

181
00:19:43,451 --> 00:19:47,781
But for me, Faith
only offered isolation.

182
00:19:48,766 --> 00:19:53,454
One of my earliest memories is
a bitter winter morning at the ranch.

183
00:19:53,761 --> 00:19:55,017
Was six.

184
00:19:56,056 --> 00:19:59,222
And as he shook and looked to the plain,

185
00:20:00,077 --> 00:20:02,827
a sudden awareness
struck me like a stone.

186
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:05,393
I do not belong here.

187
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:06,733
I've never belonged.

188
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:09,658
Was lost.

189
00:20:11,055 --> 00:20:12,268
Lost in Faith.
(Lost in Faith)

190
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:19,157
Now all these years
Faith then left behind.

191
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:21,861
My accent has disappeared,

192
00:20:21,966 --> 00:20:23,855
my few friends there are gone,

193
00:20:24,999 --> 00:20:29,403
however, I'm still one
kid lost in the dark fields,

194
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:32,574
trying to find my way.

195
00:20:49,937 --> 00:20:51,455
There are no professional in this?

196
00:20:54,277 --> 00:20:56,200
We have some lakes in Minnesota.

197
00:20:59,309 --> 00:21:01,909
I never imagined in a million
years, which would end up staying here.

198
00:21:03,636 --> 00:21:05,528
Do not you tell me what you think of the book.

199
00:21:07,283 --> 00:21:09,294
You even ran away from home?

200
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,627
Gives a good story.

201
00:21:18,968 --> 00:21:21,686
You have a style
writing clear and succinct.

202
00:21:21,968 --> 00:21:25,958
And I worried with the character
principal, not only for being naturally curious

203
00:21:26,439 --> 00:21:27,577
but get me
really relate to it.

204
00:21:28,573 --> 00:21:31,854
My parents were academics e. ..
and almost all were kids at school *.

205
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,164
I was the wet dream of bullies.

206
00:21:36,618 --> 00:21:38,426
- You have a gift for words.
- No.

207
00:21:40,053 --> 00:21:40,877
Yes, you.

208
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,089
Not really.

209
00:21:42,392 --> 00:21:44,091
- You can not accept a compliment?
- Okay!

210
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:48,360
Thanks!
You can steal them for your book.

211
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:51,381
- I will.
- The title has to change.

212
00:21:51,451 --> 00:21:52,566
I like the title.

213
00:21:54,368 --> 00:21:56,178
It's a bit...

214
00:21:57,694 --> 00:21:59,079
It's a bit extravagant.

215
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:03,813
Extravagant?
Faith is a real place, is a play on words.

216
00:22:03,986 --> 00:22:05,004
I realized.

217
00:22:05,459 --> 00:22:06,940
But it sounds religious.

218
00:22:07,229 --> 00:22:08,872
Not that there's anything wrong with that,
just...

219
00:22:09,051 --> 00:22:10,377
You never you enter it.

220
00:22:11,223 --> 00:22:11,930
Are you being too literalist.

221
00:22:12,313 --> 00:22:15,540
Well, as you gird
just the facts and characters...

222
00:22:16,097 --> 00:22:17,570
your story is really exciting.

223
00:22:17,643 --> 00:22:22,109
When you stray from the subject, or play
with words as you like to say

224
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:25,162
I have a tendency to
become a little sentimental.

225
00:22:26,297 --> 00:22:29,210
O my God! We do not
we become sentimental?

226
00:22:29,538 --> 00:22:30,685
It was already expecting that.

227
00:22:31,745 --> 00:22:34,642
What is wrong with you when you talk about writing?
You become so aggressive!

228
00:22:37,494 --> 00:22:38,569
Taste.

229
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:43,035
Didi...

230
00:22:43,224 --> 00:22:45,059
you are hiding something.

231
00:22:45,955 --> 00:22:48,146
And not only marked cards.

232
00:22:48,879 --> 00:22:53,190
He came only to visit a friend
Minnesota which is housed here.

233
00:22:55,145 --> 00:22:56,715
One thing turns, however...

234
00:22:56,918 --> 00:22:58,562
if I had less than ten years...

235
00:22:59,023 --> 00:23:00,476
Do you mean twenty...!

236
00:23:01,415 --> 00:23:02,628
Look who's talking.

237
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:09,384
So this... friend, have a name?

238
00:23:13,903 --> 00:23:15,872
His name is Chase, okay?

239
00:23:18,966 --> 00:23:20,153
Chase?

240
00:23:24,729 --> 00:23:25,729
Gin!

241
00:23:33,804 --> 00:23:35,177
Very nice.

242
00:23:36,336 --> 00:23:37,111
'Quarrel.

243
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,094
You have good taste.

244
00:23:44,317 --> 00:23:46,004
I did not do anything about it.

245
00:23:46,752 --> 00:23:48,186
Just waved...

246
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,603
immense.

247
00:23:51,794 --> 00:23:53,657
It seems he knows what he does.

248
00:23:56,462 --> 00:23:58,440
They are... stable.

249
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,670
Leal... good with Billy...

250
00:24:03,614 --> 00:24:04,853
I love my partner.

251
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:06,731
Amo.

252
00:24:08,658 --> 00:24:10,356
I just...

253
00:24:17,175 --> 00:24:18,973
You know something sprinklers?

254
00:24:23,263 --> 00:24:24,933
I think it is repaired.

255
00:24:25,748 --> 00:24:27,347
- It's almost ready to open water.
- What?

256
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:34,599
Should I turn it off?

257
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:38,563
Are you okay?

258
00:24:44,006 --> 00:24:46,512
You're right. Not... a
problem of water pressure.

259
00:24:48,127 --> 00:24:50,304
Just for future information...

260
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:51,931
"Almost ready" not
means "fully ready"

261
00:24:52,015 --> 00:24:54,629
since the objective is
watering the grass and not my face.

262
00:24:55,639 --> 00:24:57,144
I am so sorry.

263
00:24:57,533 --> 00:24:58,546
Even...

264
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:01,314
I feel really bad.

265
00:25:02,117 --> 00:25:03,102
Seriously.

266
00:25:03,507 --> 00:25:06,267
- You did it on purpose.
- No! I swear.

267
00:25:06,461 --> 00:25:09,387
I wish I could be so smart.

268
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:11,151
Are you?

269
00:25:13,974 --> 00:25:14,974
Stop!

270
00:25:20,973 --> 00:25:21,973
Stop!

271
00:25:51,207 --> 00:25:52,719
These things are great,

272
00:25:53,372 --> 00:25:54,946
to diet.

273
00:25:55,534 --> 00:25:57,726
First you tell me that
write in the wrong direction,

274
00:25:58,052 --> 00:26:00,403
then you tell me you do not have a phone
and now this?

275
00:26:02,578 --> 00:26:05,072
What they taught you in Minnesota?

276
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:07,931
Not much, apparently.

277
00:26:08,422 --> 00:26:10,732
Thank God for small miracles.

278
00:26:20,105 --> 00:26:21,456
? Hello ..

279
00:26:25,024 --> 00:26:26,041
? Well ..

280
00:26:30,386 --> 00:26:32,074
? You showed him some ships?

281
00:26:34,027 --> 00:26:34,966
? Great...

282
00:26:43,503 --> 00:26:46,189
? Yes, let me use the coupons.

283
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,523
? Right...

284
00:26:54,007 --> 00:26:54,850
? Yes ..

285
00:26:59,324 --> 00:27:01,480
? Is he there?

286
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,959
? Hands him the phone.

287
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:09,299
? Hello?

288
00:27:09,567 --> 00:27:12,865
? Can you hear me?

289
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:40,118
Hello

290
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:42,044
Hello

291
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,134
Can I help you?

292
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:49,106
I'm searching for Didi.

293
00:27:52,021 --> 00:27:53,033
She left.

294
00:27:53,806 --> 00:27:55,196
Buy some supplies.

295
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,529
It's true! She talked about it.

296
00:27:58,453 --> 00:28:00,018
Gave me the idea.

297
00:28:00,349 --> 00:28:01,404
It should not take.

298
00:28:12,454 --> 00:28:14,171
Want to sit?

299
00:28:14,635 --> 00:28:15,913
I do not want to bother him.

300
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,510
Not to bother.
Sit.

301
00:28:18,995 --> 00:28:20,747
In this case...
thanks.

302
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:28,498
You're welcome.

303
00:28:44,635 --> 00:28:45,856
Beautiful day, huh?

304
00:28:48,525 --> 00:28:51,866
Do you by any chance... will not be the Chase?

305
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:57,305
... Then had rivers
I sweat to run down his face, right?

306
00:28:57,618 --> 00:28:58,964
Standing there like a deer blinded,

307
00:28:58,964 --> 00:29:01,402
this is just the largest stadium in the state, ok?

308
00:29:01,766 --> 00:29:03,369
There were hundreds of people in the stands,

309
00:29:03,685 --> 00:29:05,795
could well have been millions...
There was a TV crew...

310
00:29:06,075 --> 00:29:07,535
- It seems important thing...
- Yes, yes...

311
00:29:07,851 --> 00:29:10,095
I do not know who was more
nervous, me or that damn calf.

312
00:29:10,095 --> 00:29:11,349
Trust me, it was the calf.

313
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:13,515
- I go the calf roast.

314
00:29:13,781 --> 00:29:14,647
Me too.

315
00:29:15,818 --> 00:29:20,340
Then later, after...
I chase, chase, chase...

316
00:29:20,535 --> 00:29:22,294
and BOOM! Tie it, right?

317
00:29:22,501 --> 00:29:25,910
And somehow...
I do not know how...

318
00:29:25,959 --> 00:29:29,736
tie gets stuck in my foot,

319
00:29:29,864 --> 00:29:32,062
and was dragged 50 meters into the arena.

320
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:33,141
Appeared on the news of 11 hours.

321
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:34,280
Are you invent...

322
00:29:34,645 --> 00:29:36,113
It looks terrifying.

323
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,063
Totally humiliating
more concretely.

324
00:29:42,544 --> 00:29:44,315
Can not wait to read your book.

325
00:29:46,038 --> 00:29:47,214
Do not have many expectations.

326
00:29:47,488 --> 00:29:48,706
He did not connect...

327
00:29:49,298 --> 00:29:50,922
He is very talented.

328
00:29:53,387 --> 00:29:54,279
Thank you.

329
00:29:54,712 --> 00:29:55,687
It's the truth.

330
00:30:04,056 --> 00:30:07,549
So Chase has a girlfriend?
Or should I say, a boyfriend?

331
00:30:08,722 --> 00:30:10,510
Mother, let alone type.

332
00:30:11,873 --> 00:30:14,305
Someone wants more beans?

333
00:30:14,477 --> 00:30:15,512
I want to.

334
00:30:15,896 --> 00:30:16,895
Fine.

335
00:30:20,976 --> 00:30:22,924
Why not ask me first?

336
00:30:23,358 --> 00:30:26,642
- Well, you never introduce me to your friends.
- Note the indirect!

337
00:30:28,842 --> 00:30:31,622
You know that the mother does not want
you do this when there are visitors.

338
00:30:32,011 --> 00:30:33,244
Yes, yes, yes.

339
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:44,024
So?

340
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,710
What do you think?

341
00:30:50,354 --> 00:30:51,716
I think...

342
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,805
this is the perfect temperature.

343
00:30:57,601 --> 00:30:59,222
About Chase!

344
00:30:59,549 --> 00:31:00,465
Who?

345
00:31:02,692 --> 00:31:04,268
You mean your new boyfriend?

346
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,698
Dodgy!

347
00:31:09,244 --> 00:31:10,705
It feels good.

348
00:31:13,498 --> 00:31:14,800
Not what you think.

349
00:31:17,429 --> 00:31:18,539
Never is.

350
00:31:23,929 --> 00:31:25,756
The Everett used
write their pieces, you know?

351
00:31:25,892 --> 00:31:27,462
put all the neighborhood kids in the cast,

352
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:29,233
rehearsing in the back.

353
00:31:30,148 --> 00:31:31,939
I saw his masterpiece,

354
00:31:32,777 --> 00:31:35,269
"The Massacre of the Twisted Humboldt"

355
00:31:35,613 --> 00:31:36,568
Three times.

356
00:31:44,289 --> 00:31:46,385
He paid to have seen.

357
00:31:46,758 --> 00:31:48,654
I am surprised by
he'll never have mentioned.

358
00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:54,871
Thank you.

359
00:32:18,233 --> 00:32:21,821
- Hello
- Hello

360
00:32:37,393 --> 00:32:39,969
I understand that all
this has been embarrassing for you,

361
00:32:41,732 --> 00:32:42,833
They love you.

362
00:32:43,781 --> 00:32:47,630
Listen... if it is easier
for you, I keep my distance...

363
00:32:48,315 --> 00:32:49,430
Chase?

364
00:32:50,992 --> 00:32:52,465
Duty calls.

365
00:32:56,939 --> 00:32:58,193
Chase?

366
00:33:01,682 --> 00:33:03,871
I have plans for tomorrow...

367
00:33:08,485 --> 00:33:09,788
be with you.

368
00:33:26,869 --> 00:33:29,468
I'm looking for
Humboldt man more attractive.

369
00:33:30,013 --> 00:33:31,364
You must be lost.

370
00:33:33,576 --> 00:33:36,274
No. .. I'm in the right place.

371
00:34:08,444 --> 00:34:11,353
You really ought to think about having lessons harmonica.

372
00:34:11,753 --> 00:34:12,778
Shut up!

373
00:34:13,028 --> 00:34:14,869
I'm making you a serenade.

374
00:34:15,197 --> 00:34:17,605
This is... even scary.

375
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,091
What?

376
00:34:33,229 --> 00:34:35,083
Not kidding me, but...

377
00:34:38,269 --> 00:34:40,859
Since childhood I wanted
visit the region of the redwoods.

378
00:34:40,893 --> 00:34:42,537
I do not know why, just...

379
00:34:46,009 --> 00:34:47,431
something told me.

380
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:51,947
Ever had such places?
You always wanted... visit?

381
00:34:53,847 --> 00:34:55,133
Barcelona.

382
00:34:56,244 --> 00:34:58,155
Buenos Aires.

383
00:34:58,533 --> 00:35:01,715
- Bakers Field...
- Stop to enjoy.

384
00:35:05,864 --> 00:35:08,085
- Stop!
- Someone has tickled.

385
00:35:08,108 --> 00:35:09,185
Stop!

386
00:35:31,081 --> 00:35:32,212
Tell me how you do.

387
00:35:33,646 --> 00:35:34,465
Do what?

388
00:35:34,596 --> 00:35:35,868
What thou wilt.

389
00:35:36,774 --> 00:35:39,060
It seems to me that no cues
concerns interfere,

390
00:35:39,663 --> 00:35:42,459
not that there's anything
wrong with that, I admire him.

391
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:44,553
What stops you then?

392
00:35:45,235 --> 00:35:47,154
I need to eat.

393
00:35:47,534 --> 00:35:48,234
Guaranteed.

394
00:35:49,584 --> 00:35:53,532
If it makes you feel better, this
routine as a writer dying of hunger,

395
00:35:53,547 --> 00:35:55,349
not exactly...
Worry-free, you know?

396
00:35:55,595 --> 00:35:56,902
Odd jobs, odd hours.

397
00:35:58,818 --> 00:36:01,648
I have to constantly remind myself that...

398
00:36:04,057 --> 00:36:06,992
continuing to do what I like,

399
00:36:11,284 --> 00:36:12,835
everything will be solved.

400
00:36:20,148 --> 00:36:22,958
Most people
when you know it is uncomfortable,

401
00:36:24,138 --> 00:36:27,995
or worse, have pity on me.

402
00:36:28,537 --> 00:36:31,138
My God, Everett, give me
more credibility than that.

403
00:36:31,485 --> 00:36:33,468
So I do not know until
point have dealt with children...

404
00:36:37,101 --> 00:36:38,712
Tell me more about Billy.

405
00:36:42,529 --> 00:36:43,885
He likes boats.

406
00:36:46,459 --> 00:36:48,114
Never would have guessed.

407
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,834
I used to stutter all day.

408
00:36:53,593 --> 00:36:56,917
Could count up to 10 in Spanish,
thanks to the servant.

409
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,527
And one day it stopped.

410
00:37:07,698 --> 00:37:08,698
Hey, baby...

411
00:37:09,923 --> 00:37:12,684
What is the name of a fish
Golden beginning with 'P'? Six letters.

412
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,065
Palmer?

413
00:37:16,184 --> 00:37:17,184
Right.

414
00:37:24,339 --> 00:37:26,483
You know, Chase seems to me a good boy.

415
00:37:34,244 --> 00:37:35,738
Let's not there,
okay?

416
00:37:37,426 --> 00:37:39,252
I was not going anywhere.

417
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,670
Well, whatever.

418
00:38:12,408 --> 00:38:13,408
Good night.

419
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:36,396
Father?

420
00:38:36,853 --> 00:38:37,703
Yes?

421
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:39,688
What are we doing here?

422
00:38:40,531 --> 00:38:44,373
We're here because this is the last
place your mother would look for me.

423
00:38:45,052 --> 00:38:46,471
The mother is well?

424
00:38:46,925 --> 00:38:48,632
Yes, yes.

425
00:38:50,446 --> 00:38:51,684
Chase still out there?

426
00:38:53,342 --> 00:38:54,299
Yes.

427
00:38:55,198 --> 00:38:56,656
Is busy writing.

428
00:39:03,181 --> 00:39:06,004
The wounds can lead
long time to heal, son.

429
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:19,025
I'm in trouble, Shane.

430
00:39:19,861 --> 00:39:21,494
You two already...?

431
00:39:22,297 --> 00:39:23,499
No.

432
00:39:24,788 --> 00:39:26,889
Mano rays,
have self-control.

433
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,167
Not only have responsibilities.

434
00:39:31,932 --> 00:39:33,628
You know, there is a line...

435
00:39:35,808 --> 00:39:37,357
I can not overcome.

436
00:39:38,899 --> 00:39:40,041
Listens Everett,

437
00:39:40,529 --> 00:39:41,354
Love it?

438
00:43:25,095 --> 00:43:26,095
Good morning.

439
00:43:28,542 --> 00:43:29,542
Good morning.

440
00:43:54,627 --> 00:43:57,089
You do not know that you are attractive,
do you?

441
00:44:03,194 --> 00:44:04,214
I think not.

442
00:44:08,742 --> 00:44:10,107
It's good.

443
00:47:13,798 --> 00:47:15,851
Wanted this
weeks last forever.

444
00:47:20,993 --> 00:47:22,410
And it can.

445
00:47:45,975 --> 00:47:48,605
<i>? Now all these years later,</i>

446
00:47:48,857 --> 00:47:50,994
<i>? Faith left behind,</i>

447
00:47:51,398 --> 00:47:53,055
<i>? my accent has disappeared,</i>

448
00:47:53,294 --> 00:47:55,352
<i>? my few friends there are gone,</i>

449
00:47:56,353 --> 00:48:01,454
<i>? However, I continue to be
that boy lost in the dark field,</i>

450
00:48:02,038 --> 00:48:04,564
<i>? trying to find my way.</i>

451
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:14,962
What's happening?

452
00:48:18,588 --> 00:48:19,618
Nothing.

453
00:48:29,699 --> 00:48:31,025
Continues.

454
00:48:32,469 --> 00:48:35,240
The image of the lost boy is beautiful.

455
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:36,915
But...

456
00:48:37,163 --> 00:48:38,526
I do not understand the meaning.

457
00:48:38,909 --> 00:48:40,374
The significance?

458
00:48:42,575 --> 00:48:45,906
Only some of
we still lost.

459
00:48:47,438 --> 00:48:49,368
But this is really a journey?

460
00:48:51,499 --> 00:48:53,026
What do you know about journeys?

461
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:58,198
What does that mean?

462
00:49:01,225 --> 00:49:02,167
I do not know.

463
00:49:07,311 --> 00:49:10,687
Some of us prefer
keep in our safe corners.

464
00:49:11,986 --> 00:49:14,162
Some of us can not afford to

465
00:49:14,485 --> 00:49:18,362
wander around without a destination
trying to find himself.

466
00:49:19,611 --> 00:49:23,366
At least I try
I find myself.

467
00:49:28,631 --> 00:49:31,314
Why are you writing this book,
have now?

468
00:49:32,126 --> 00:49:35,291
Nor have the
courage to say why you fled.

469
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:53,895
You know?

470
00:49:55,231 --> 00:50:01,125
You walk around saying that searches
special person with whom to spend the rest of your life.

471
00:50:01,763 --> 00:50:04,829
But the truth is that
you do not trust anyone.

472
00:50:05,996 --> 00:50:10,128
You know what?
You never take a risk in your life!

473
00:50:10,203 --> 00:50:14,017
I'm risking
everything to be here with you!

474
00:50:16,622 --> 00:50:17,860
What are you risking?

475
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:05,606
You do not ran away from home.

476
00:52:07,781 --> 00:52:10,048
I was unwanted.

477
00:52:23,215 --> 00:52:25,355
Still needs much work.

478
00:52:25,691 --> 00:52:26,691
No.

479
00:52:28,619 --> 00:52:30,023
It's so free.

480
00:52:31,757 --> 00:52:33,699
It's what makes it so powerful.

481
00:52:46,338 --> 00:52:47,142
? Hello?

482
00:52:49,981 --> 00:52:50,824
? Hello ..

483
00:52:54,164 --> 00:52:54,972
? What?

484
00:52:57,607 --> 00:52:58,534
? When?

485
00:53:01,251 --> 00:53:04,194
? No!
You are good...

486
00:53:07,122 --> 00:53:07,847
? Yes ..

487
00:53:26,259 --> 00:53:28,147
They will return soon.

488
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:32,995
When?

489
00:53:34,546 --> 00:53:35,444
Tomorrow.

490
00:53:49,618 --> 00:53:51,637
Has some disinfectant?

491
00:53:51,975 --> 00:53:53,978
Good afternoon to you too.

492
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,311
Sorry.

493
00:53:56,516 --> 00:53:58,377
I have a fungal problem.

494
00:53:58,976 --> 00:54:00,883
Well, let's see...

495
00:54:04,513 --> 00:54:07,984
Challenge someone to realize this
system of organization men.

496
00:54:20,195 --> 00:54:21,113
What's happening?

497
00:54:24,342 --> 00:54:25,193
Nothing.

498
00:54:33,502 --> 00:54:36,384
Realize very afraid
more than what you think.

499
00:54:49,486 --> 00:54:51,426
I had it marked until Sunday.

500
00:54:57,526 --> 00:54:58,607
I gotta go.

501
00:55:03,125 --> 00:55:07,659
Why do not you give
a long walk, Chase?

502
00:55:10,311 --> 00:55:12,347
That's why I came here,
right?

503
00:55:19,504 --> 00:55:21,955
It was the last thing
I expected it to happen.

504
00:55:30,025 --> 00:55:31,785
I hope you do not think I'ma bad mother.

505
00:55:32,157 --> 00:55:34,022
I never think that.

506
00:55:34,523 --> 00:55:39,047
I do not want to lose perspective on whether
your father and I had a wonderful marriage.

507
00:55:40,797 --> 00:55:42,419
I love him deeply.

508
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:45,431
Could not ask for a better partner.

509
00:55:45,923 --> 00:55:50,582
And when I look back at the
my life is difficult for me to imagine it without him.

510
00:55:53,195 --> 00:55:54,871
Gave me in crazy at times.

511
00:55:55,943 --> 00:55:57,380
And keeps on giving.

512
00:56:00,105 --> 00:56:01,341
But build something.

513
00:56:03,659 --> 00:56:05,576
Something meaningful.

514
00:56:08,110 --> 00:56:09,636
Ever made of it to do?

515
00:56:12,289 --> 00:56:13,050
No.

516
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:18,431
He continues in St. Louis,

517
00:56:18,747 --> 00:56:21,552
at least the last time I had
brave enough to look on the internet.

518
00:56:22,689 --> 00:56:26,429
Ever... think it?

519
00:58:11,978 --> 00:58:12,811
What is it?

520
00:58:13,046 --> 00:58:14,425
Just a little reminder.

521
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:33,184
Everett, I...

522
00:58:33,951 --> 00:58:34,862
Hope you like it.

523
00:58:37,905 --> 00:58:39,925
I would like more if I could open.

524
00:58:40,997 --> 00:58:42,241
This might help.

525
00:58:45,843 --> 00:58:46,990
One for you...

526
00:58:48,078 --> 00:58:49,245
one for me.

527
00:58:56,679 --> 00:58:58,476
You have no remedy, you know that?

528
00:58:59,437 --> 00:59:00,937
Learned from the best.

529
01:00:56,755 --> 01:00:58,466
Promise me one thing?

530
01:01:01,748 --> 01:01:03,023
Five years from now...

531
01:01:05,605 --> 01:01:07,436
no matter where we are,
no matter what happens...

532
01:01:08,091 --> 01:01:10,142
find ourselves in this exact location,

533
01:01:10,989 --> 01:01:13,045
at exactly this time.

534
01:01:22,759 --> 01:01:24,092
I promise.

535
01:01:40,047 --> 01:01:42,548
Do not forget that
when you travel south of here,

536
01:01:43,463 --> 01:01:44,463
at the intersection of the road.

537
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:51,644
I am no longer lost.

538
01:03:24,393 --> 01:03:25,652
We have arrived!

539
01:03:27,522 --> 01:03:28,610
Welcome.

540
01:03:29,107 --> 01:03:29,870
Hello

541
01:03:30,775 --> 01:03:34,523
My God, look what you
grew up in a week!

542
01:03:35,885 --> 01:03:37,101
I like that t-shirt.

543
01:03:40,711 --> 01:03:42,398
What kind of ship you have here?

544
01:03:43,625 --> 01:03:45,234
His grandmother gave him, was not Billy?

545
01:03:45,456 --> 01:03:47,464
It's really cool, eh?

546
01:03:48,066 --> 01:03:49,199
Someone called?

547
01:03:49,271 --> 01:03:50,857
Just the usual.

548
01:03:59,503 --> 01:04:01,794
Let's put this to others, ok?

549
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:15,541
How was your trip?

550
01:04:16,312 --> 01:04:18,399
Funny.
The weather was good.

551
01:04:18,984 --> 01:04:19,884
Good.

552
01:04:31,569 --> 01:04:33,900
Everett, mold still in the shower.

553
01:04:34,266 --> 01:04:35,498
Sorry, I...

554
01:04:36,390 --> 01:04:37,520
OK. Guess I'll have to go to the store.

555
01:04:37,916 --> 01:04:40,613
- No. I can handle it alone.
- No. Okay, seriously.

556
01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:43,496
Okay.

557
01:04:45,402 --> 01:04:46,137
Yes.

558
01:05:43,152 --> 01:05:45,811
I love you so much!

559
01:05:50,239 --> 01:05:51,875
Tell me what to do.

560
01:06:00,037 --> 01:06:03,051
Do not know if this will
work, but it's just what they had.

561
01:06:04,562 --> 01:06:06,408
I have to leave for awhile.

562
01:06:06,696 --> 01:06:08,045
What's happening?

563
01:06:09,699 --> 01:06:09,987
Billy!

564
01:06:10,266 --> 01:06:11,369
What's happening?

565
01:06:12,252 --> 01:06:14,262
Billy, all is well, drop it baby.

566
01:06:14,290 --> 01:06:15,203
Billy!

567
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:17,854
Alright!

568
01:06:20,190 --> 01:06:22,832
Billy's alright,
he just goes out for a bit.

569
01:06:22,836 --> 01:06:24,447
I'll be back for you.

570
01:06:32,145 --> 01:06:33,145
Goodbye.

571
01:06:35,962 --> 01:06:36,962
Not delay.

572
01:06:58,227 --> 01:07:00,101
He said where he went?

573
01:07:00,715 --> 01:07:02,990
He mentioned one last stop
but...

574
01:07:03,416 --> 01:07:04,641
can be anywhere.

575
01:08:41,252 --> 01:08:43,750
Five years later

576
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:05,833
Someone is ready to sail.

577
01:09:10,128 --> 01:09:14,472
You come here first
or go right to their parents?

578
01:09:14,924 --> 01:09:16,264
Depends on traffic.

579
01:09:16,624 --> 01:09:18,851
There are still many road works.

580
01:09:20,055 --> 01:09:22,834
Today just buying a model ship.

581
01:09:23,366 --> 01:09:25,770
Otherwise we have to enlarge the house.

582
01:09:26,581 --> 01:09:28,088
That's an order, Billy.

583
01:09:29,870 --> 01:09:31,874
Do you want something to Eureka?

584
01:09:32,725 --> 01:09:33,425
No.

585
01:09:34,885 --> 01:09:36,196
Just enjoy your day.

586
01:09:45,810 --> 01:09:47,805
No, no, no tires.
Almost done.

587
01:09:48,748 --> 01:09:49,748
It's great, bro.

588
01:09:53,672 --> 01:09:55,524
He probably will not appear.

589
01:09:59,326 --> 01:10:00,808
It appears.

590
01:10:38,811 --> 01:10:40,171
You are the Everett?

591
01:10:42,665 --> 01:10:43,429
Yes.

592
01:10:46,845 --> 01:10:48,772
I've heard so much.

593
01:10:51,631 --> 01:10:52,865
My name is Jessica.

594
01:10:58,229 --> 01:10:59,240
We could talk?

595
01:11:03,635 --> 01:11:05,036
I do not believe.

596
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,696
He never smoked a lifetime.

597
01:11:12,082 --> 01:11:13,494
Why did not he tell me?

598
01:11:16,195 --> 01:11:18,030
It happened so quickly,

599
01:11:18,687 --> 01:11:19,687
know?

600
01:11:20,837 --> 01:11:23,339
Until the end he thought it would improve.

601
01:11:24,242 --> 01:11:25,263
Chase knows...

602
01:11:25,335 --> 01:11:26,693
is an idealistic, right?

603
01:11:28,431 --> 01:11:30,426
At the time that morphine acted, he...

604
01:11:31,227 --> 01:11:32,775
hardly knew where I was.

605
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:37,795
God, you would be
so proud of him now.

606
01:11:39,033 --> 01:11:40,681
He continued to write,

607
01:11:41,201 --> 01:11:44,706
e. ..
did some work with autistic children.

608
01:11:48,213 --> 01:11:50,270
The day before his death, was...

609
01:11:50,508 --> 01:11:52,285
incredibly lucid.

610
01:11:53,271 --> 01:11:56,293
He insisted that I was here,
in Humboldt,

611
01:11:56,693 --> 01:11:59,537
this day
this box.

612
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:05,751
He said you was his favorite cousin.

613
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:10,982
There is one more thing.

614
01:12:38,899 --> 01:12:40,202
Where is his key?

615
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:44,549
Buried

616
01:12:44,935 --> 01:12:46,102
with him.

617
01:15:37,889 --> 01:15:41,028
<i>? Now, five years later
time we meet we again</i>

618
01:15:42,630 --> 01:15:45,612
<i>? so many things happened,
so many things have changed,</i>

619
01:15:47,471 --> 01:15:49,939
<i>? but as the very forests of redwoods,</i>

620
01:15:50,509 --> 01:15:51,971
<i>? something...</i>

621
01:15:52,175 --> 01:15:55,336
<i>? will always stand the test of time.</i>

622
