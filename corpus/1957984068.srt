00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:29,363
[Kara panting]

2
00:00:29,447 --> 00:00:31,449
Hah. I'm still winning.

3
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,959
I'd give up now because you are never
going to beat...

4
00:00:42,126 --> 00:00:43,502
- You sure?
- Hey!

5
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,930
- How's it feel to lose to your daughter?
- [Panel beeps]

6
00:00:54,472 --> 00:00:56,641
It's not over yet.

7
00:00:57,683 --> 00:01:00,228
Sorry,
I can't hear you from first place.

8
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:01,895
Isaid...

9
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:03,146
Wait, what's that?

10
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:05,816
Cheating! That's cheating.

11
00:01:06,234 --> 00:01:07,944
[Alura] Can't hear you
from first place.

12
00:01:19,163 --> 00:01:20,957
[Grunting]

13
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:25,711
- Ha-ha!
- [Panel beeps]

14
00:01:25,795 --> 00:01:30,466
General alura zor ei,
high defender of Krypton, has lost!

15
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:33,219
[Alura] Park computer,
activate bench.

16
00:01:34,637 --> 00:01:36,097
- [Groans]
- Yes!

17
00:01:36,222 --> 00:01:40,017
Kara zor ei, beloved daughter
and crowd favorite has won!

18
00:01:40,518 --> 00:01:41,894
Park computer, water.

19
00:01:41,978 --> 00:01:45,273
Didn't anyone teach you not to gloat?

20
00:01:45,815 --> 00:01:49,735
I mean, the woman in charge
of that lesson also cheats, so...

21
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:51,361
[Chuckles]

22
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,073
Your form has gotten better.

23
00:01:54,824 --> 00:01:56,158
You've been practicing.

24
00:01:56,242 --> 00:01:58,703
Every morning.
You're welcome to tag along.

25
00:01:58,786 --> 00:01:59,787
I'm a gracious winner.

26
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,122
I could give you pointers.

27
00:02:01,414 --> 00:02:02,873
[Chuckles]

28
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:05,668
Believe me, if I could join you instead
of dealing with

29
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:08,129
the science council every morning,
I would.

30
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,089
And the guild and...

31
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:13,426
I know, I know.
You've got all ofargo city to oversee

32
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:14,844
and no time to do it in.

33
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:16,344
It's just...

34
00:02:16,554 --> 00:02:19,181
It'd be nice to see you more,
you know?

35
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:26,813
Hey.

36
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:29,650
If it's important to you,
then I'll make time.

37
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,902
You come first.

38
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:34,030
- Really?
- Always, my Kara.

39
00:02:34,447 --> 00:02:35,447
Always.

40
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,162
Besides, I'm not the only one
about to be busy.

41
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:42,955
Please tell me this isn't a ploy

42
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:45,499
to get me to watch
uncle jor El's new baby again.

43
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:48,586
I swear, that kid puts
everything in his mouth.

44
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:52,715
I... is this...

45
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:55,926
Does this mean my application
to the guild's been...

46
00:02:56,469 --> 00:02:57,469
Accepted.

47
00:02:58,012 --> 00:03:01,974
Kara zor El, you have officially
been assigned to the military guild.

48
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,101
Welcome to the ranks, cadet.

49
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,437
You've more than earned this.

50
00:03:07,897 --> 00:03:08,897
[Gasps]

51
00:03:09,357 --> 00:03:10,941
[Distant rumbling]

52
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:12,025
What is that?

53
00:03:17,073 --> 00:03:18,073
[Alura] No!

54
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:21,201
Not now.

55
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:23,079
[Kara gasps]

56
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:24,747
[Rumbling approaching]

57
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:32,128
Come on!

58
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,859
Computer, begin activation sequence,
code "in-ze."

59
00:03:53,943 --> 00:03:56,529
- What's going on?
- Jor El warned me this was coming.

60
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:58,572
He told the science council
that they had to act,

61
00:03:58,656 --> 00:04:00,908
but they wouldn't listen.
They never listen!

62
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:05,663
It's too late for Krypton,
but not for argo city.

63
00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:09,583
I've been building hyper-sleep escape
pods based off jor El's prototype.

64
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:12,628
The council was against him,
so I've had to do this in secret.

65
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:15,756
It's why I've been
gone so much. I just...

66
00:04:16,424 --> 00:04:18,467
I just thought we'd have
more time to finish.

67
00:04:19,135 --> 00:04:22,096
We can get everybody out?
Well, that's great, right?

68
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,305
[Alarm buzzing]

69
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:25,149
[Female electronic voice]
Activation failure.

70
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,856
Activation failure. Activation failure.

71
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:35,359
- Activation failure.
- [Alura] No!

72
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,278
Work, damn you, work!

73
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,738
[Sighs] I tried, jory...

74
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:41,699
I just needed more time to finish them.

75
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:42,825
Mom.

76
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:44,076
[Sighs] I tried.

77
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,662
[Female electronic voice]
Activation success.

78
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:11,020
I am so proud of you.

79
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:21,947
Every day, I am in awe of the strong,
kind, wonderful person you've become.

80
00:05:22,615 --> 00:05:26,452
And I am so lucky to be your mother.

- [Rumbling]
- [Kara gasps]

82
00:05:43,219 --> 00:05:48,057
Find your cousin and know
that I will always love you, Kara.

83
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:50,684
[Gasps] What are you doing?

84
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:52,478
Mom! No, please!

85
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:55,189
Mom, please don't do this!
What are you doing? Mom!

86
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:09,912
[Explosions booming]

[Sighs]

91
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,644
Okay. You can do this, Kara.

92
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,854
Mall computer, map.

93
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:45,776
Mall computer, map.

94
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,946
Map! Map!

95
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:55,411
[Groans]

96
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:57,788
How do you locate uniforms
in the supply depot?

97
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:05,504
[Clears throat] Oh.

98
00:09:05,713 --> 00:09:08,132
Great. Yes, thanks.

99
00:09:12,136 --> 00:09:14,388
[Sighs] Mall, bring up...

100
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:20,769
[Laughs] What a weirdo.

101
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:22,104
Can you believe that?

102
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:23,856
Talk about anger issues.

103
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:26,150
[Both laugh]

104
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:28,152
[Distant rumbling]

105
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,155
- [People gasping]
- [Man] What was that? Oh, no!

106
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:45,836
Solomon grundy, born on a Monday!

107
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:48,630
[Man screams]

108
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:55,304
Destroyed Metropolis on a Tuesday!

109
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:58,307
Killed Superman right now.

110
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:02,561
Where are you, Superman?

111
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:06,523
Grundy wants to play!

112
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,985
You do know
grundy and Monday don't rhyme, right?

113
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:12,988
Also, I'm going to take you down.

114
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,867
[Scoffs] You're not Superman.

115
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,410
I'm Supergirl.

116
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,746
Remember the name,
'cause you're... [yelps]

117

124
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:21,640
You're no Superman.

125
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:28,564
You're not anything, girlie!

126
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:37,614
[Batarang beeps]

[Grundy groaning softly]

133
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,436
I'm fine, kal.

134
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:13,317
We need to talk.

135
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:23,618
[Man] Hey!

136
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:26,038
No need to worry, citizen of Metropolis.

137
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:29,166
- Solomon grundy has been...
- My apartment building!

138
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,500
It... you...

139
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:32,127
Look what you've done!

140
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,796
Uh, I saved it. You're welcome.

141
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:37,049
You destroyed it!

142
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:39,676
Just have your robot servants
build you a better place.

143
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:42,179
Or government-issued robots.

144
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:44,556
Construction robots?

145
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,141
Regular robots.

146
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:47,893
Any robots?

147
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,438
What kind of weird hellscape
are you from?

148
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:52,814
Krypton is...

149
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:55,901
Was great.
Not like your backwards planet.

150
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,277
Backwards?

151
00:12:57,361 --> 00:13:00,405
Uh, you live in homes made
out of aluminum and hot sand.

152
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:01,799
[Man] Not anymore, thanks to you!

153
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,635
- Your cousin is a problem.
- [Kara] You should be thanking me!

154
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:05,619
- I just saved you!
- You said we could trust her.

155
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:07,203
We can.

156
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:09,122
She's only been here a couple of months.

157
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:10,791
She's doing her best.

158
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,626
It's not good enough.

159
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:14,461
What's that supposed to mean?

160
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,923
You were so happy to meet someone
alive from Krypton,

161
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:20,175
you didn't stop to think about
the consequences

162
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:21,885
for the rest of us mere humans.

163
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:24,656
In the short time she's been here,
she's destroyed buildings

164
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,515
and failed to control her powers.

165
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,976
Worse, she doesn't care.

166
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,062
With her abilities,
that makes her a threat.

167
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:35,190
I don't like what you're implying.

168
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:44,281
Kara...

169
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:57,087
[Grundy continues groaning softly]

170
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:22,654
Sorry, got held up in star city

171
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:24,573
and didn't get the call
until a second ago.

172
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,200
Hey, where's Superman?

173
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:30,203
Taking care of a problem.

174
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:31,788
I'm more worried about this.

175
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:35,000
Grundy was using it in his rampage.

176
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,502
Wait, Solomon grundy?

177
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:40,338
The guy who thinks
grundy and Monday rhyme?

178
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:44,259
There's no way he could build
something this complex.

179
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:47,679
[Grundy groaning softly]

180
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:20,420
You know, this is where I used to go

181
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:22,589
whenever I had a bad day.

182
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,556
I'd sit here as a kid
and look at the stars, and...

183
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,393
Little by little, my problems
would just seem less ovennhelming.

184
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,940
Were any of your problems,
"Batman is kicking me off the planet?"

185
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:45,529
Not exactly, but I'm pretty sure that's
just because I didn't know him then.

186
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,156
[Scoffs]

187
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,700
Kara, I can't imagine
what you're going through.

188
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:54,412
Having to adjust
to a new planet, new powers,

189
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:55,789
getting knocked off course,

190
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:58,208
and arriving decades
after you were supposed to.

191
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:01,628
Finding out your baby cousin
isn't so little anymore.

192
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:06,133
All I'm asking is that
you be more careful,

193
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,260
and to give earth a chance.

194
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:09,970
Kal, I'm trying.

195
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:11,179
I swear.

196
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:16,643
It's just all so primitive and weird
and wrong and different here.

197
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,187
I know it's not Krypton.

198
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:21,857
But it could be home, if you let it.

199
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,191
No, it can't!

200
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:25,861
Krypton is my home.

201
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:29,114
It doesn't matter that it's gone.
It will always be my home.

202
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,117
Kara, I know you're upset.

203
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,202
You can't possibly know how I feel!

204
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:40,083
[Sighs] Batman's right.
I don't belong here.

205
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:42,794
With Krypton gone, with mom gone...

206
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:45,922
I don't belong anywhere.

207
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:50,051
So, kick me out. I don't care.

208
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:58,894
Or we could try something different.

209
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:15,619
Trust me?

210
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,504
[Device droning]

211
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:28,798
[Device booming, echoing]

212
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:42,686
Come on!

213
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:45,398
Wait! Where are we going?

214
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:52,989
[Device droning]

215
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,417
[Kara] Whoa.

216
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:52,340
Where are we?

217
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,218
Earth, in the 3ist century.

218
00:18:56,511 --> 00:19:00,390
Kara zor El,
welcome to the legion of super-heroes.

219
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:08,940
[Man munching]

220
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,491
- [Explosion]
- [Grunts]

221
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:25,498
[Man gasps]

222
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:30,920
[Guards scream]

223
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,006
[Man whimpering]

224
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:40,138
Please, take the badge. Just...

225
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:42,432
You can get in. Just don't kill me.

226
00:19:57,572 --> 00:19:59,741
- [Trilling noise]
- [Explosion]

227
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:20,011
[Soldier grunts]

228
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:30,105
[Electricity crackles]

229
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,194
No guns.

230
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:38,988
[Soldiers grunting]

231
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,286
[Soldiers groaning softly]

232
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:53,711
[Batman] Why are you here?

233
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:55,713
Who are you?

234
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:58,133
[Soldiers choking]

235
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:07,350
[Straining]
The circle remains unbroken.

236
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:08,726
[9393]

237
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,366
Batman to any justice league members,
there's been an attack at star labs.

238
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,617
Do you copy?

239
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:28,830
No. I don't know what they were after.

240
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:38,423
[Kara] Okay, new question.

241
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:41,468
Uh, how are we in the 3ist century?

242
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:42,844
Also, why?

243
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:44,137
Also, what?

244
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:45,847
We came here with the time bubble.

245
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:48,933
It's extremely rare technology
that allows travel between

246
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:52,270
two fixed points in time
and only those points in time.

247
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:55,356
At least that's how saturn girl
explained it to me.

248
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,734
She's one of the founders
of the legion of super heroes.

249
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:00,528
Think of them
as the future's justice league.

250
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:04,532
They're a group of heroes who banded
together to fight crime inspired by...

251
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:07,451
Well, me.

252
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:10,872
They contacted me through
the time bubble

253
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:12,248
after we formed the league.

254
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:15,168
We've been in sporadic
contact ever since.

255
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:17,587
Which brings us to why we're here.

256
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:24,802
They run a training program
for potential new legionnaires.

257
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:29,140
The legion academy.

258
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:33,102
I thought, if you wanted,
you could train here.

259
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:34,395
It's not Krypton,

260
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:37,357
but it's a little closer
than earth of the 2ist century.

261
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:43,446
[Kara] I don't know, kal.

262
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:46,699
If you want to go back,
it's your decision.

263
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:48,743
I'll support you either way.

264
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:50,452
[Man] Superman.

265
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:52,329
Kara?

266
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:55,917
Oh, wow. It is so great to meet you.

267
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:02,215
I'm mon El, one of the other trainees
at legion academy.

268
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:03,341
Mon El?

269
00:23:03,675 --> 00:23:05,718
Wait, you're Kryptonian?

270
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:08,596
Daxamite, actually, from planet daxam.

271
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,391
But I hope you don't mind
me saying this.

272
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:12,976
I love Krypton.

273
00:23:13,643 --> 00:23:15,061
That's why I changed my name.

274
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:17,313
I've been a fan ever since I was a kid.

275
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:22,235
The scientific wonders,
the emphasis on conformity, order.

276
00:23:22,527 --> 00:23:23,611
The robots.

277
00:23:23,945 --> 00:23:24,945
The robots.

278
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:29,242
Maybe not so much the kryptonite,
but in every other way,

279
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:31,494
Krypton was incredible.

280
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:35,123
I know we've just met,
but I really hope you decide

281
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:37,083
to come train
with us here at the academy.

282
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:40,211
- Really?
- Yep.

283
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:42,880
- It seemed like you weren't sure.
- I am now.

284
00:23:42,964 --> 00:23:45,091
We could still go back and train
on the farm together.

285
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:46,342
Nope. I'm good.

286
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:47,427
Lift tractors?

287
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,304
Bye, kal. Sorry, you can't stay.

288
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:50,972
[Chuckles]

289
00:23:54,726 --> 00:23:57,395
[Time bubble drones, booms]

290
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:10,658
Want the tour?

291
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:14,037
This is the legion academy.

292
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:16,581
It's where our training takes place.

293
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:19,125
The cube is the fight simulation room.

294
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,836
It's also connected to the legion's
holographic library...

295
00:24:24,714 --> 00:24:26,716
I'm sure you'll be able to find
your way around.

296
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,885
And that's pretty much the tour.

297
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,887
Except the dorms...

298
00:24:31,304 --> 00:24:33,348
Girls are there, boys are there.

299
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:37,143
And the window we use to sneak out
after curfew is there.

300
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:38,436
Noted.

301
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:40,897
What's that one?

302
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:50,865
[Mon El] That's the vault.

303
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:52,551
It's where the legion keeps
all the weapons

304
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:54,035
they've taken from their enemies.

305
00:24:55,745 --> 00:24:57,080
[Device whirrs]

306
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:03,294
It's protected by an insane
security system,

307
00:25:03,378 --> 00:25:06,464
and it's never been broken into
in the entire history of the legion.

308
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:09,175
The system's on a hair trigger,

309
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:11,552
and it's completely off-limits
to us academy members.

310
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:14,889
So, in other words,
avoid the death lasers.

311
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,272
- This is dawnstar.
- Your roommate.

312
00:25:24,232 --> 00:25:25,232
Oh!

313
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:28,820
I am so glad to meet
someone else who can fly.

314
00:25:28,903 --> 00:25:32,073
We can pair up in training
and practice cool power combos.

315
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:34,701
Ooh, and team up for missions.

316
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:39,872
Sorry. I'm all, "blah, hi, dawnstar."

317
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:42,041
It's just nice to meet a new friend.

318
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,127
Well, that's everything,

319
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,671
except meeting the rest
of the academy trainees and...

320
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,510
Brainiac?

321
00:25:53,845 --> 00:25:55,346
He's got a weapon. Get back!

322
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:56,430
Wait!

323
00:25:57,515 --> 00:25:59,350
I don't know
how you survived the bullet,

324
00:25:59,434 --> 00:26:01,936
but I am not going
to let you hurt anyone else.

325
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:03,688
I don't know what you're talking about.

326
00:26:04,105 --> 00:26:08,234
But given your unhinged actions,
I'm regarding you as a threat.

327
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:10,653
[Kara grunts]

328
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:12,947
Unhinged?

329
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,658
You tried to kill Superman, my cousin.

330
00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:21,038
[Kara grunts]

331
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:23,833
Believe me,
if I had tried to kill Superman,

332
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:25,668
I would have succeeded.

333
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:29,464
I am the universe's
only 12th-level intellect.

334
00:26:29,547 --> 00:26:34,177
I invented this force field using
kinetic-reactive photonic energy.

335
00:26:35,178 --> 00:26:36,596
[G rowls, grunts]

336
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:43,186
Which means, the more
you punch it, the more solid it gets.

337
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:45,897
[Kara grunting]

338
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,661
Great. Thanks for the tip.

339
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:03,039
[Grunts]

340
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,671
[Grunts]

341
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:14,467
Okay. That's it.

342
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:27,814
[Grunts]

343
00:27:31,192 --> 00:27:32,318
[Grunting, straining]

344
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:48,376
Fight, fight...

fight, fight, fight, fight.

349
00:28:15,403 --> 00:28:16,487
[Man] Stop!

350
00:28:18,656 --> 00:28:20,908
What the ever-loving hell
is going on here?

351
00:28:24,662 --> 00:28:27,957
Reckless endangerment
and damage to a classroom.

352
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:30,334
What do you have to say for yourselves?

353
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:37,300
[Kara] He's brainiac.

354
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:38,968
Why are we all just sitting here?

355
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:40,845
As I attempted to tell you,

356
00:28:41,512 --> 00:28:43,180
I am not brainiac.

357
00:28:43,764 --> 00:28:45,308
You pulled a weapon on us.

358
00:28:45,725 --> 00:28:47,325
I was going to make repairs on the laser

359
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:49,854
for a project
and you jump to conclusions.

360
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:51,856
Not surprising for a lesser mind.

361
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:53,566
How is this not a villain?

362
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:55,651
Kara, he's not brainiac.

363
00:28:55,735 --> 00:28:57,612
This is brainiac 5.

364
00:28:57,904 --> 00:29:00,740
Scientists on planet colu
got their hands on the organic parts

365
00:29:00,823 --> 00:29:02,783
of the original brainiac cyborg

366
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:05,161
and then used that to make
him and his family.

367
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:08,664
That is a gross oversimplification
of the cloning process.

368
00:29:08,748 --> 00:29:11,959
- Anyhow...
- Rna mutation alone has allowed me

369
00:29:12,043 --> 00:29:13,419
to surpass my clone siblings.

370
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:14,754
Anyhow...

371
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:17,340
He's a bright young man,

372
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:20,301
and he's enrolled in legion academy,
just like you.

373
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:22,053
By "bright young man,"

374
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:24,680
she means I possess
a 12th-level intelligence

375
00:29:24,764 --> 00:29:27,016
as measured by the scientific
minds of col...

376
00:29:27,642 --> 00:29:30,853
Since we don't have time to sufficiently
describe me,

377
00:29:30,937 --> 00:29:32,605
that will have to do.

378
00:29:32,939 --> 00:29:35,942
[Scoffs] I've got
some words to describe you.

379
00:29:36,025 --> 00:29:38,945
Unless those words are "genius,"
they're probably incorrect.

380
00:29:39,028 --> 00:29:42,114
Hey, knuckleheads, you're in trouble.

381
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:44,200
The rest of the legion
are off on a mission,

382
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:46,035
leaving the three of us in charge,

383
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:48,829
and you just made our jobs
that much more difficult.

384
00:29:48,913 --> 00:29:50,539
We are truly disappointed.

385
00:29:51,165 --> 00:29:54,293
Since this is your first offense,
we're letting you off with a warning.

386
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:58,589
But in the future, try to act more like
the heroes you wish to become.

387
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:01,258
Dismissed.

388
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:12,311
What is president saturn girl thinking,
letting that kid in?

389
00:30:12,395 --> 00:30:13,771
Superman vouched for Supergirl.

390
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:16,190
I'm talking about brainiac 5.

391
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:17,273
Why is he here?

392
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:21,362
Every single brainiac clone
ever has gone evil.

393
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:23,739
Brainiac 2
was an intergalactic assassin.

394
00:30:23,823 --> 00:30:27,326
Brainiac 3 tried to overthrow
the united planets with mind control.

395
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:30,204
Brainiac 4
is just a straight up serial killer.

396
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:31,664
This is what they do.

397
00:30:31,914 --> 00:30:35,251
The brainiacs show up,
attempt some evil plot, then disappear.

398
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:38,421
[Scoffs] It's only a matter of time
before this kid does the same.

399
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:41,674
Look, timber wolf, we agree with you,

400
00:30:42,383 --> 00:30:43,384
but we were outvoted.

401
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:44,843
Were we?

402
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:48,681
I haven't spoken to a single other
legionnaire who voted to let him in.

403
00:30:49,807 --> 00:30:51,684
I think there's
something fishy going on here.

404
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,646
We've got bigger problems
than your conspiracy theories right now.

405
00:31:01,444 --> 00:31:04,280
We still have no idea
where the rest of the legion is.

406
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:07,450
Last check-in, saturn girl
and the others were on their way

407
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:10,077
to deal with the terrorist attacks
on planet durla.

408
00:31:10,161 --> 00:31:13,330
Then, suddenly, boom, radio silence.

409
00:31:13,414 --> 00:31:15,666
Oh. They're still not answering comms?

410
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,710
They're not even showing up on the map.

411
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:20,046
It's like they disappeared from the face
of the universe.

412
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:23,090
We've been having computer troubles
over the past 24 hours.

413
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:25,259
The issue could be on our end.

414
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:27,094
We can't discount
anything at this point.

415
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:30,181
Shadow lass, chemical king,
look into our system.

416
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:31,807
It could just be bouncing boy

417
00:31:31,891 --> 00:31:33,642
pulling pranks
with the comm arrays again.

418
00:31:34,143 --> 00:31:36,187
But if not, we need to be prepared.

419
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:39,690
[Shadow lass] And above all,
don't tell the academy kids.

420
00:31:40,024 --> 00:31:41,776
The less who know, the better.

421
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,322
It has to be tonight.

422
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,877
That was epic!

423
00:32:00,211 --> 00:32:01,295
Did they kick you out?

424
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:04,799
[Laughs] Uh, she
wouldn't be here if they did.

425
00:32:05,007 --> 00:32:06,383
Everyone, give her room.

426
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:09,595
Kara,
this is the rest of the legion academy.

427
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:11,764
Seriously, that fight was nuts.

428
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:13,933
I'm bouncing boy, planet earth.

429
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:18,854
Ta-da!

430
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:23,317
Now, if I said to you,
I've got a bunch of naltorian frogs,

431
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,820
would you be down to help me release
them in the science lab?

432
00:32:25,903 --> 00:32:27,905
No -come on. It'd be great.

433
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:30,782
Enchanté.

434
00:32:31,242 --> 00:32:33,244
Invisible kid, also from planet earth.

435
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:35,663
Whoa! [Chuckles]

436
00:32:35,746 --> 00:32:37,832
Can you turn other things
invisible too?

437
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,040
[Invisible kid] Yes.

438
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:43,045
Well, actually, no,
but I'm really close to figuring it out.

439
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:46,799
Okay. I love the hair.

440
00:32:47,216 --> 00:32:48,968
Oh, yeah, hate the cape.

441
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:50,636
We can work with the boots.

442
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:52,847
Triplicate girl. Planet cargg.

443
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,975
Okay, so, this is phantom girl.

444
00:32:56,058 --> 00:32:57,143
[Gasps]

445
00:32:59,145 --> 00:33:00,145
She's shy.

446
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:04,066
[Object squeaking]

447
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,943
Proty, our class pet.

448
00:33:09,071 --> 00:33:10,071
[Proty] Hello.

449
00:33:10,281 --> 00:33:12,366
And arms fall off boy.

450
00:33:13,075 --> 00:33:14,118
[Strains]

451
00:33:18,706 --> 00:33:21,625
And sometimes they even stay on.

452
00:33:21,709 --> 00:33:22,709
Wow.

453
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:26,172
That's... really cool.

454
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:28,340
No. We suck.

455
00:33:28,591 --> 00:33:30,301
Hey, that's not true.

456
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:33,637
I'll have you know my psychic
pathfinding powers are unique.

457
00:33:33,971 --> 00:33:35,514
Yes, so are mine.

458
00:33:35,598 --> 00:33:37,016
That doesn't mean they're good.

459
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:38,976
There's only one open legion spot.

460
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:41,103
And everyone knows
mon e! Is gonna get it.

461
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:43,781
We're never going to make
it into the legion.

462
00:33:44,023 --> 00:33:47,067
Faceit
we're waiting-list material at best.

463
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,571
Not even the legion of substitute heroes
would have us.

464
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:53,282
Hey, you don't know
what's going to happen.

465
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,701
I think everyone
has the potential to be heroes,

466
00:33:56,327 --> 00:33:58,078
even people like brainiac 5.

467
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:01,582
But maybe, for the safety
of the rest of the buildings,

468
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:03,834
you should just avoid him.

469
00:34:06,337 --> 00:34:08,497
[Chemical king] The legion
does more than simply fight.

470
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,817
- We are the once called in...
- Or maybe you can't. [Chuckles]

471
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:13,052
When there are disasters,
diplomatic incidents

472
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:14,678
or when people are in need of rescue.

473
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:16,972
To be considered for the legion,

474
00:34:17,056 --> 00:34:18,682
you need to train your mind.

475
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:21,769
So, who can solve
this hyperdrive equation?

476
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:24,687
Supergirl?

477
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:27,191
Supergirl!

478
00:34:31,946 --> 00:34:34,323
[Device trilling]

479
00:34:42,665 --> 00:34:43,749
[Scoffs]

480
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:45,709
That is clearly incorrect.

481
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:52,883
[Shadow lass] The legion does
more than simply solve problems.

482
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:56,470
We are the front lines,
stopping terrorists,

483
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:59,056
administering justice,
and preventing war.

484
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:01,475
To be considered for the legion,

485
00:35:01,976 --> 00:35:03,269
you need to train your body.

486
00:35:03,644 --> 00:35:05,729
Training room, fight simulation beta.

487
00:35:06,272 --> 00:35:07,189
[Female electronic voice] Acknowledged.

488
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:09,733
Flight simulation beta
will commence now.

489
00:35:14,113 --> 00:35:15,113
Got it!

490
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,289
[Kara] Oh, no.

491
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:25,457
Too slow.

492
00:35:30,963 --> 00:35:32,047
[Brainiac 5] No.

493
00:35:32,131 --> 00:35:35,968
You need a stabilizer
so the a! System doesn't malfunction.

494
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:38,804
No, you don't, because it's already
in the programming.

495
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:41,807
I am literally
the descendant of a cyborg.

496
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:44,310
Logically, you should
be listening to me.

497
00:35:47,563 --> 00:35:50,482
I'm from Krypton. We invented robotics.

498
00:35:50,566 --> 00:35:53,569
And I'm from colu, we perfected them.

499
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:54,902
I'm right!

500
00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:18,052
You are objectively in the wrong.

501
00:36:44,078 --> 00:36:46,622
Okay. Maybe it did need a stabilizer.

502
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:51,919
We need to shut it down.

503
00:36:52,211 --> 00:36:54,755
- If you damage the psionic processor...
- Way ahead of you.

504
00:36:57,257 --> 00:36:59,676
[Clears throat]
Just give me some space to move.

505
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:13,273
There.
Engage the motion targeting system.

506
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:19,863
Understood.
Everyone stay perfectly still.

507
00:37:34,545 --> 00:37:35,545
Got it.

508
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:36,964
Impressive thinking.

509
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:41,260
In truth,
I almost forgot this was all your fault.

510
00:37:41,343 --> 00:37:42,344
[Kara] My fault?

511
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:46,473
Listen, you green skinned, overgrown,
poor excuse for a cyborg.

512
00:37:46,557 --> 00:37:48,326
- Where do you get off telling me...
- Nope, I'm done.

513
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:50,060
You're done. Training over.

514
00:37:50,144 --> 00:37:52,187
- You two are out.
- But_

515
00:37:52,271 --> 00:37:54,940
Disappointment doesn't even
begin to cover your actions.

516
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:56,817
We will deal with you in the morning.

517
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,193
Until then...

518
00:38:07,286 --> 00:38:09,079
Hey, don't beat yourself up.

519
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:12,749
Honestly, you are not the first person
to get into a fight with brainiac 5.

520
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,626
- Really?
- Are you serious?

521
00:38:15,085 --> 00:38:17,463
Mr. "I'm more logical than thou?"

522
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:19,882
He's a jerk who thinks
he's better than everyone.

523
00:38:20,424 --> 00:38:21,884
No one wants him around.

524
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:24,761
Not even timber wolf
and the other legionnaires.

525
00:38:24,845 --> 00:38:26,430
I mean, hejust doesn't belong here.

526
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:52,079
What?

527
00:38:52,623 --> 00:38:54,958
Supergirl. You coming?

528
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:06,887
Like I said, we've got to go before all
the good seats are taken.

529
00:39:12,351 --> 00:39:13,351
Proty.

530
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,062
Where are you?

Brainiac 5 is not who he pretends to be.

He planted a virus
in our computer system.

It's why we haven't been able to reach
the rest of the legion.

kill triplicate girl and then walk away,

only to come back

it'll trigger a purge
of the entire room.

706
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:48,296
Brainy, I'm not great
at gently fighting things.

707
00:50:50,048 --> 00:50:51,674
[Strains] Just try!

708
00:50:55,762 --> 00:50:56,762
[Gasps]

709
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:13,655
Not to rush you, but hurry it up.

710
00:51:13,738 --> 00:51:14,781
I'm trying.

711
00:51:15,657 --> 00:51:18,701
The code keeps resetting. [Pants]

712
00:51:28,253 --> 00:51:29,337
[Grunts]

713
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:38,845
Got it!

714
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:09,042
That's it.

715
00:52:09,168 --> 00:52:10,670
Whoo! [Laughs]

716
00:52:10,753 --> 00:52:11,753
We did it!

717
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:16,300
We did it.

718
00:52:18,845 --> 00:52:19,971
[Mon El] We certainly did.

719
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:23,683
Brainiac 5 broke the code...

720
00:52:27,103 --> 00:52:28,103
[Kara gasps]

721
00:52:28,187 --> 00:52:30,440
And the circle remains unbroken.

722
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:37,196
[Kara groaning]

723
00:52:43,244 --> 00:52:44,370
Kara!

724
00:52:44,454 --> 00:52:45,580
[Grunts]

725
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:48,374
[Strains] What are you doing?

726
00:52:48,458 --> 00:52:50,835
For the universe's
only 12th-level intellect,

727
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:52,920
you sure are dumb, aren't you?

728
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:57,759
- [Device trills]
- I'm in the dark circle.

729
00:53:21,032 --> 00:53:22,408
[Timber wolf yelling, grunting]

730
00:53:43,221 --> 00:53:44,972
[Chemical king grunts]

731
00:53:45,807 --> 00:53:46,891
[Grunts]

732
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:49,227
[Grunting]

733
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,621
[Brainiac 5 choking]

734
00:54:09,372 --> 00:54:10,540
[Grunts]

735
00:54:12,834 --> 00:54:15,044
[Groaning]

736
00:54:16,129 --> 00:54:18,423
I'd stop moving so much if I were you.

737
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:21,801
It spreads the kryptonite
from the dagger faster.

738
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:23,845
Why? [Groans]

739
00:54:23,928 --> 00:54:26,389
[Mon El] Of all people,
you should understand.

740
00:54:27,223 --> 00:54:30,726
Your culture was the greatest
the universe had ever seen.

741
00:54:31,269 --> 00:54:34,355
Orderly. Uniform. Pure.

742
00:54:35,356 --> 00:54:36,941
But this world we live in,

743
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:39,402
this world is rotten.

744
00:54:39,694 --> 00:54:42,321
The legion is the heart of the rot,

745
00:54:42,405 --> 00:54:46,451
encouraging losers like triplicate girl
and bouncing boy.

746
00:54:47,118 --> 00:54:50,621
They delude misfits into thinking
they can be heroes,

747
00:54:50,705 --> 00:54:52,415
when they're just freaks.

748
00:54:53,458 --> 00:54:54,709
[Kara grunts]

749
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:57,670
[Mon El] Now, the dark circle
will take over.

750
00:54:58,045 --> 00:54:59,982
- [Kara grunts softly]
- [Mon El] We, who are superior,

751
00:55:00,006 --> 00:55:01,446
- will lead the way...
- [Kara yells]

752
00:55:02,717 --> 00:55:07,054
Elevating the world to heights
not seen since the Kryptonian empire.

753
00:55:10,266 --> 00:55:11,726
The legion has fallen.

754
00:55:12,477 --> 00:55:15,021
The time of freaks has ended.

755
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:18,483
As for you two,
our leader would like a word.

756
00:55:25,531 --> 00:55:27,200
[Kara groaning]

757
00:55:32,288 --> 00:55:33,288
Hold on, Kara.

758
00:55:33,873 --> 00:55:34,916
Just hold on.

759
00:55:35,208 --> 00:55:39,337
Be silent in the presence
of the beginning and the end.

760
00:55:44,884 --> 00:55:47,303
Hello, grandson.

761
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:50,430
Brainiac.

762
00:55:51,474 --> 00:55:52,892
No, impossible.

763
00:55:53,559 --> 00:55:54,559
You're dead.

764
00:55:55,144 --> 00:55:57,480
You died in the 2ist century!

765
00:55:58,731 --> 00:56:02,068
The kryptonite bullet
went through my brain, yes,

766
00:56:02,985 --> 00:56:06,656
but there was enough left
to rebuild around the damage.

767
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:11,953
And a genius like myself never
goes without a backup plan.

768
00:56:12,453 --> 00:56:16,457
I created the dark circle
a 1,000 years past

769
00:56:16,541 --> 00:56:20,002
to carry out my vision for a new world.

770
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:24,674
It was the circle who stole my brain
out of my old body.

771
00:56:25,091 --> 00:56:30,805
It was they who regrew it,
tending to me over the centuries.

772
00:56:31,097 --> 00:56:36,018
But all would be for naught
if it weren't for you.

773
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:39,146
What do you mean?

774
00:56:39,939 --> 00:56:43,234
Did you think you just
happened to overhear

775
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:46,320
our plans to take the miracle machine?

776
00:56:46,404 --> 00:56:47,905
[Laughs]

777
00:56:47,989 --> 00:56:51,909
The other clones
were mere 10th-level intelligences.

778
00:56:51,993 --> 00:56:57,164
There was only one being in the universe
who could break the security code.

779
00:56:57,915 --> 00:56:58,916
You.

780
00:56:59,792 --> 00:57:03,671
We used you to get the machine.

781
00:57:04,088 --> 00:57:05,088
Were...

782
00:57:05,423 --> 00:57:08,217
You said my clone siblings
were 10th-level.

783
00:57:09,051 --> 00:57:10,094
Where are they?

784
00:57:11,846 --> 00:57:13,055
Hmm.

785
00:57:13,556 --> 00:57:15,057
Right here.

786
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:20,855
By the time my brain finished regrowing,
my old body was useless.

787
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,232
The circle cloned me,

788
00:57:23,316 --> 00:57:27,653
and I picked the best parts
from each to build a new one.

789
00:57:27,737 --> 00:57:31,657
They weren't pleased
when they found out.

790
00:57:32,325 --> 00:57:33,909
You lied to us.

791
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:35,578
Stay away!

792
00:57:35,911 --> 00:57:37,121
Stay away from me!

793
00:57:37,246 --> 00:57:39,457
No! No! God, no!

794
00:57:40,249 --> 00:57:44,545
But, logically,
what other purpose could you serve?

795
00:57:44,629 --> 00:57:46,756
The fools thought
they were being groomed

796
00:57:46,839 --> 00:57:49,759
as the next leader of the dark circle.

797
00:57:49,842 --> 00:57:53,346
For hubris alone, they deserve death.

798
00:57:53,763 --> 00:57:58,559
I am the most advanced
mind that has ever existed.

799
00:57:58,893 --> 00:58:02,188
Thus, logically, I must be the one

800
00:58:02,271 --> 00:58:06,067
to purge the universe of chaos and rot.

801
00:58:06,442 --> 00:58:10,404
For those who are superior
will lead the way

802
00:58:10,488 --> 00:58:13,532
to a pure and orderly future.

803
00:58:14,617 --> 00:58:18,120
The only one strong enough
to stop me was Supergirl.

804
00:58:18,537 --> 00:58:23,125
So, we watched her
and found her weakness.

805
00:58:23,209 --> 00:58:26,003
Kryptonite. [Strains]

806
00:58:26,587 --> 00:58:31,092
And your drive to help
those more pathetic than yourself.

807
00:58:32,343 --> 00:58:33,886
You're a monster.

808
00:58:36,472 --> 00:58:38,224
I am a hero.

809
00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:42,853
There are threats on the horizon
only I can counter.

810
00:58:43,145 --> 00:58:46,232
When I bend reality to my will,

811
00:58:46,315 --> 00:58:51,112
all will laud me as their savior.

812
00:58:53,114 --> 00:58:58,077
Once Supergirl is dead,
I will incorporate you into my body.

813
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:01,080
The son will become the father,

814
00:59:01,622 --> 00:59:05,459
and the circle will remain unbroken.

815
00:59:16,971 --> 00:59:18,055
Find them.

816
00:59:18,597 --> 00:59:21,976
I will begin to attune
myself to the machine.

817
00:59:27,982 --> 00:59:29,233
[Kara groaning]

818
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:33,529
Hurts.

819
00:59:33,612 --> 00:59:34,612
It's going to be okay.

820
00:59:35,614 --> 00:59:38,492
I just need to get the kryptonite
out of your wound, all right?

821
00:59:39,869 --> 00:59:41,328
[Grunts, groaning]

822
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:46,792
No! I'm working on something,
but you've got to stay awake.

823
00:59:48,419 --> 00:59:49,420
Kara.

824
00:59:50,421 --> 00:59:51,421
Kara?

825
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:53,840
Trying to.

826
00:59:54,258 --> 00:59:56,427
Keep talking.

827
00:59:57,470 --> 00:59:59,221
[Continues groaning]

828
01:00:03,392 --> 01:00:05,728
Talking to people is not my strong suit.

829
01:00:06,771 --> 01:00:08,981
Could I list
chemical compositions instead?

830
01:00:09,064 --> 01:00:10,524
[Kara breathing heavily]

831
01:00:11,609 --> 01:00:14,320
- [Yells]
- No, no, no. Kara!

832
01:00:14,403 --> 01:00:15,403
Stay with me.

833
01:00:16,113 --> 01:00:17,113
[Groans]

834
01:00:28,667 --> 01:00:29,794
I'm sorry.

835
01:00:31,003 --> 01:00:32,505
I was wrong about everything.

836
01:00:32,755 --> 01:00:35,341
I'm supposed to be smart and logical,

837
01:00:35,424 --> 01:00:37,927
but my plan to stop the dark circle
wasn't logical.

838
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:40,387
It was me trying
to prove to everyone that I...

839
01:00:40,471 --> 01:00:41,806
I'm not my family.

840
01:00:42,848 --> 01:00:45,100
I'm not just another evil clone.

841
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:49,480
But I'm not. I messed it up.

842
01:00:50,439 --> 01:00:51,607
I'm not like you.

843
01:00:52,024 --> 01:00:53,150
You're so confident,

844
01:00:53,776 --> 01:00:54,777
and brilliant,

845
01:00:55,402 --> 01:00:56,862
and strong, and...

846
01:00:57,905 --> 01:00:58,905
And?

847
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:05,621
And beautiful.

848
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:07,080
And?

849
01:01:07,122 --> 01:01:09,458
And I can't think straight
when you smile at me.

850
01:01:10,751 --> 01:01:12,294
[Device beeps, trills]

851
01:01:26,642 --> 01:01:27,685
[Door opening]

852
01:01:31,105 --> 01:01:32,105
[Kara gasps]

853
01:01:38,571 --> 01:01:40,614
- Well, there you two are.
- Finally.

854
01:01:40,781 --> 01:01:41,949
Good work, pg.

855
01:01:42,283 --> 01:01:44,243
- Triplicate girl?
- You're alive.

856
01:01:44,869 --> 01:01:46,620
Yeah, no thanks to mon El!

857
01:01:46,704 --> 01:01:48,264
You know that son of a bitch killed me?

858
01:01:48,497 --> 01:01:50,916
You know, I saw him meeting up
with those people in masks.

859
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,711
I peeled off an extra me
right before I got to the vault

860
01:01:53,794 --> 01:01:55,546
and he killed my third self.

861
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:57,381
So, I need you nerds
to come up with a plan

862
01:01:57,464 --> 01:01:59,300
to save the day
so I can kill him right back.

863
01:01:59,383 --> 01:02:02,219
Did I mention, I'm going to kill him?

864
01:02:02,303 --> 01:02:04,072
[Invisible kid] Yeah, only about,
like, a million times.

865
01:02:04,096 --> 01:02:05,096
Invisible kid?

866
01:02:05,472 --> 01:02:06,632
[Invisible kid] In the flesh.

867
01:02:06,682 --> 01:02:09,059
Phantom girl found triplicate girl
right before the attack.

868
01:02:09,143 --> 01:02:10,895
I managed to turn invisible and escape.

869
01:02:10,978 --> 01:02:13,147
And the three of us
have been hiding ever since.

870
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:16,025
And your clothes are...

871
01:02:16,734 --> 01:02:19,069
On! The clothes are on!

872
01:02:19,153 --> 01:02:21,155
I turned all of me invisible this time.

873
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:23,198
See, I told you.
I told you I almost had it.

874
01:02:23,282 --> 01:02:25,034
So, the teachers are knocked out,

875
01:02:25,117 --> 01:02:26,761
the rest of the academy
members are trapped,

876
01:02:26,785 --> 01:02:29,580
and I am just itching
to give mon e! A little...

877
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:30,748
Payback.

878
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:33,167
What happened to,
"we're waiting-list material?"

879
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:36,211
[Chuckles] No. Screw that. I'm pissed.

880
01:02:36,295 --> 01:02:38,923
Now, we're kicking-ass material.

881
01:02:39,131 --> 01:02:40,491
[Phantom girl] The legion is gone.

882
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:42,050
It's up to us.

883
01:02:42,635 --> 01:02:44,094
So, let's go be heroes.

You've got an idea, don't you?

885
01:02:53,062 --> 01:02:56,523
I have the beginnings of a plan,
yes, but_

886
01:02:56,607 --> 01:02:59,234
We'll need all the academy
members to pull it off.

887
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:00,921
[Triplicate girl] Yeah. Uh, excuse me.

888
01:03:00,945 --> 01:03:02,279
Is the plan to flirt forever?

889
01:03:02,363 --> 01:03:04,424
Because we're kind
of in a time crunch here, lovebirds.

890

01:04:42,755 --> 01:04:44,089
- [Gasps] Yes!
- Yeah! All right!

[Mon El] Keep searching.

905
01:04:54,058 --> 01:04:56,643
Brainiac has almost finished
syncing to the machine.

906
01:04:57,061 --> 01:04:58,687
We can't let them ruin this now.

907

[Brainiac] No.

[Brainiac] As will those
strong enough to ever pose a threat.

And any world that could ever disrupt
the dominance of brainiac!

930

but I was nothing.

You were copies of greatness.

937
01:07:55,697 --> 01:07:58,533
I am the mastermind of reality.

As long as the miracle machine
is in this reality,

947
01:08:23,392 --> 01:08:25,936
it will obey the will
of its last user.

01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:21,562
I mean, talk...

1064
01:22:21,646 --> 01:22:23,231
Uh... [clears throat]

1065
01:22:23,606 --> 01:22:24,606
Sir.

1066
01:22:25,525 --> 01:22:28,069
I'm happy to meet you, brainiac 5.

1067
01:22:29,028 --> 01:22:30,380
Uh, but if you two will excuse me,

1068
01:22:30,404 --> 01:22:33,032
I've got to get back to being...
Superman.

1069
01:22:35,201 --> 01:22:37,036
- Of course.
- Bye, kal.

1070
01:22:37,370 --> 01:22:38,370
Talk soon.

1071
01:22:39,497 --> 01:22:40,665
You didn't tell her?

1072
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:45,086
How am I supposed to ask
her to come back to the 2ist century

1073
01:22:45,169 --> 01:22:47,630
when we still don't know
what's happening?

1074
01:23:04,438 --> 01:23:05,606
[Both yelling]
