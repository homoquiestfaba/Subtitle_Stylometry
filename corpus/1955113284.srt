00:01:15,202 --> 00:01:16,202
-It's okay, baby.

3
00:01:16,694 --> 00:01:17,694
It's okay.

4
00:01:18,116 --> 00:01:19,116
I'm fine.

5
00:01:19,952 --> 00:01:21,418
It's gonna be alright.

6
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,041
<i>We gotta go</i>

7
00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:26,045
<i>We gotta go now.</i>

8
00:01:26,635 --> 00:01:27,635
<i>Alright?</i>

9
00:01:28,565 --> 00:01:30,306
Alright, they're gone!
Let's keep moving!

10
00:01:35,132 --> 00:01:36,678
-We think we should stay here.

11
00:01:37,085 --> 00:01:38,085
-Why's that?

12
00:01:38,749 --> 00:01:40,022
-Because there's food here?

13
00:01:40,702 --> 00:01:42,635
We can sleep here?
-Alright.

14
00:01:42,904 --> 00:01:44,865
If that's enough
for you, that's fine.

15
00:01:45,053 --> 00:01:46,537
-I'm scared. I don't even...

16
00:01:46,568 --> 00:01:48,372
-You know you're
just exposing yourselves.

17
00:01:48,396 --> 00:01:50,014
<i>-Don't listen to him.</i>

18
00:01:53,326 --> 00:01:55,129
<i>No, baby, keep
your eyes up.</i>

19
00:01:55,154 --> 00:01:56,515
<i>Eyes up.</i>

20
00:02:13,893 --> 00:02:15,159
This is a bad idea.

21
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:18,439
-Yeah. if you want to keep drinking
the water here, that's fine with me.

22
00:02:18,658 --> 00:02:20,103
But we're going to base.

23
00:02:28,338 --> 00:02:29,853
-I thought you said
they were gone!

24
00:02:29,878 --> 00:02:31,878
-Well, they're not gone enough.

25
00:02:34,668 --> 00:02:35,801
-Look around you.

26
00:02:36,004 --> 00:02:38,416
These houses aren't going to
protect you. We got to keep moving.

27
00:02:38,653 --> 00:02:39,653
-Are you alright?

28
00:02:40,511 --> 00:02:42,556
-Yeah, no..I trust you.

29
00:02:52,136 --> 00:02:53,136
-Thirsty?

30
00:02:54,316 --> 00:02:55,316
No, uh...

31
00:02:55,534 --> 00:02:56,534
I can make it.

32
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:05,182
-Now that we got some time,

33
00:03:06,589 --> 00:03:09,198
I want to talk about what
we were talking about earlier.

34
00:03:10,403 --> 00:03:13,270
-We don't have to.
-No, no,no...I want to.

35
00:03:13,591 --> 00:03:16,591
-No, I just...
-I think we can work on this.

36
00:03:17,802 --> 00:03:19,919
Babe...
-I know, I heard something.

37
00:05:06,356 --> 00:05:08,089
-Why you acting like that?

38
00:05:08,402 --> 00:05:09,402
-Like <i>what</i>?

39
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,791
-Like you know what
I'm already gonna say.

40
00:05:12,275 --> 00:05:13,742
-I have a few guesses.

41
00:05:22,898 --> 00:05:25,530
-They want me out of
 town, for a few days.

42
00:05:25,554 --> 00:05:27,554
-Yeah, that was my second guess.

43
00:05:27,586 --> 00:05:28,986
-It's just to Denver.

44
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,313
-Just to Denver.

45
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,719
I assume that means
you'll be missing Jill's  wedding.

46
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,810
-Look, you've made a lot
of sacrifices the past few months

47
00:05:44,184 --> 00:05:46,256
and I'm trying to
make sacrifices, too.

48
00:05:47,365 --> 00:05:48,365
Okay?

49
00:05:49,045 --> 00:05:50,669
You know, the ones
that I can make.

50
00:06:07,764 --> 00:06:08,898
So do you...uh...

51
00:06:09,085 --> 00:06:10,551
Do you know this song?

52
00:06:11,944 --> 00:06:12,944
-No.

53
00:06:13,764 --> 00:06:14,764
-Oh...

54
00:06:17,049 --> 00:06:18,908
Well, I haven't...
I haven't heard you

55
00:06:19,549 --> 00:06:20,616
play in a while.

56
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:22,940
-Yeah, I...

57
00:06:23,315 --> 00:06:24,315
haven't lately.

58
00:06:27,526 --> 00:06:28,526
David!

59
00:06:28,893 --> 00:06:29,893
We're out.

60
00:06:30,643 --> 00:06:32,110
-Shit, it's...it's Tori.

61
00:06:32,133 --> 00:06:34,533
-I don't care if it's Tori.
-Look, it will just be a minute.

62
00:07:18,711 --> 00:07:19,711
<i>-David...</i>

63
00:07:30,127 --> 00:07:31,127
-David...

64
00:07:33,705 --> 00:07:34,705
Don't go home.

65
00:07:35,837 --> 00:07:38,735
There's someone in our house.
I don't know what's happening...

66
00:07:39,267 --> 00:07:41,501
It's Jill, they killed her.

67
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,566
They're not people...

68
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:52,557
<i>They killed her.</i>

69
00:07:52,927 --> 00:07:54,146
<i>Those people...</i>

70
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,597
They killed Sam and Lori and...

71
00:07:56,621 --> 00:07:59,045
They tried to kill
me too, and I...

72
00:07:59,474 --> 00:08:00,474
I don't...

73
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,266
I don't know what to do.

74
00:08:12,038 --> 00:08:13,739
-Should have turned
your phone off dude.

75
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:15,950
-Oh, yeah! Thank you!

76
00:08:16,036 --> 00:08:18,871
-You know the day you hear that
 coming from him you know it's serious.

77
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,332
-Well, when you're at
work, of course it's different.

78
00:08:21,356 --> 00:08:22,762
-Shit!

79
00:08:23,861 --> 00:08:27,008
-You're gonna look like an idiot
 in Denver if you don't get that finished.

80
00:08:27,255 --> 00:08:30,645
-I'm gonna look like in idiot
anyways by myself, David.

81
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:38,595
You got some time to think
about it, just don't let me down.

82
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:40,471
-Okay, just do me a favor.
Just make sure

83
00:08:40,496 --> 00:08:42,744
you wear your Floaties
when you jump on the pool.

84
00:08:43,197 --> 00:08:44,197
Okay?

85
00:08:44,221 --> 00:08:47,217
I'm serious. I'm not going
to be there to catch you this time.

86
00:08:50,742 --> 00:08:53,142
-No, no, no...it's okay,
it's okay.

87
00:08:53,554 --> 00:08:54,554
It's okay.

88
00:08:56,984 --> 00:08:58,517
I'll see you in twenty.

89
00:09:22,044 --> 00:09:24,651
I...I need to go into the office.

90
00:09:34,016 --> 00:09:35,016
-Okay.

91
00:09:35,164 --> 00:09:35,976
-David!

92
00:09:36,001 --> 00:09:37,828
-Hi! Great place you
got here, man.

93
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,777
Really cute, yeah.

94
00:09:39,828 --> 00:09:41,826
I'll see you later? It was
good seeing you.

95
00:09:41,851 --> 00:09:43,249
-You, too.

96
00:09:54,864 --> 00:09:57,333
-It's not always like this.
-I know how it is.

97
00:10:02,286 --> 00:10:03,886
-I have to go to Denver.

98
00:10:07,324 --> 00:10:08,591
-Maybe that's best.

99
00:10:57,142 --> 00:10:58,790
<i>-Please, please help.</i>

100
00:11:05,017 --> 00:11:07,345
There's people out
here. Some of them are hurt.

101
00:11:08,478 --> 00:11:09,663
-I'm not a doctor, I...

102
00:11:09,688 --> 00:11:11,910
-No...We need to use your car.

103
00:11:12,331 --> 00:11:15,577
You can drive us!
We just need to get him some place safe.

104
00:11:19,636 --> 00:11:20,903
-Okay...
-Alright.

105
00:11:20,926 --> 00:11:22,416
Thank you so much.

106
00:11:31,343 --> 00:11:32,741
Oh, my god!

107
00:11:33,171 --> 00:11:34,632
Hey! You okay?

108
00:11:35,734 --> 00:11:36,734
Yeah, you okay.

109
00:11:37,976 --> 00:11:39,643
We're not far. Follow me.

110
00:11:44,722 --> 00:11:47,196
-All these people, where did
 they come from? Why are they still ...?

111
00:11:47,221 --> 00:11:49,970
-Listen, I need your
 help! We need to hurry!

112
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,283
-Look, we can't just leave them here!

113
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:06,057
-Hey! this is the world
we live in right now!

114
00:12:06,753 --> 00:12:09,963
We have to worry about
those of us who are still alive.

115
00:12:20,552 --> 00:12:21,755
-How far?
-Just up here.

116
00:12:22,223 --> 00:12:24,254
-No, I mean how far do
you need me to take these people?

117
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:26,591
-Not sure. Somewhere safe.
-Where's safe?

118
00:12:26,802 --> 00:12:30,445
-There's an evacuation point at the end
of the valley. Just not sure where.

119
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,903
Found someone with a car.

120
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:44,755
-We can't fit all these people.
-We'll make trips.

121
00:12:45,186 --> 00:12:46,186
We need to go.

122
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:47,389
-My dad can't move!

123
00:12:48,202 --> 00:12:49,202
-I can help.

124
00:12:50,342 --> 00:12:51,476
Let's get him up.

125
00:12:56,827 --> 00:12:58,623
-You aren't looking
too good yourself.

126
00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:01,139
-I'm fine.

127
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:04,154
What's wrong with
these people?

128
00:13:04,178 --> 00:13:06,178
-Well, they drank the water.

129
00:13:06,462 --> 00:13:08,946
I bet that most people
are like them by now.

130
00:13:12,431 --> 00:13:13,431
Docile and...

131
00:13:13,908 --> 00:13:14,908
stupid.

132
00:13:15,619 --> 00:13:17,446
If we ever did
stand a chance,

133
00:13:17,705 --> 00:13:19,171
we sure don't anymore.

134
00:13:24,556 --> 00:13:25,985
-Where did you come from?

135
00:13:26,845 --> 00:13:29,220
Haven't you been seeing
everything that's been happening?

136
00:13:57,455 --> 00:13:59,322
-Tori's flight gets in at 6.

137
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,546
Man, do you think that

138
00:14:04,234 --> 00:14:05,434
Tori'd ever let me

139
00:14:06,242 --> 00:14:07,575
diddle her honeypot?

140
00:14:10,297 --> 00:14:12,062
-You're gonna bring this up again?

141
00:14:12,086 --> 00:14:14,086
-I'm just saying, dude.
I think I've got a shot.

142
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:16,999
How many drinks do you think it
would take for her to actually like...

143
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,023
lower her standards?

144
00:14:19,249 --> 00:14:20,449
-First off I don't...

145
00:14:21,264 --> 00:14:22,647
Yeah, you do have
a shot, yeah.

146
00:14:22,671 --> 00:14:24,671
She's just your
boss, no big deal.

147
00:14:24,702 --> 00:14:26,139
Yeah, great.

148
00:14:28,241 --> 00:14:29,241
-Shit, dude.

149
00:14:31,772 --> 00:14:32,772
Come on.

150
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:34,972
Another plane went down.

151
00:14:36,204 --> 00:14:37,871
-<i>Another one?</i> Like in...?

152
00:14:37,895 --> 00:14:39,524
-Yeah, that's two planes.

153

<i>-We've just received an update

I mean, the last plane
was like an hour ago!

164
00:15:09,192 --> 00:15:11,019
I mean... nine planes,
that ain't no accident.

say that people should remain calm</i>

<i>and not flood the airport phone lines
with inquiries regarding loved ones</i>

183

184
00:16:22,485 --> 00:16:24,149

<i>-Terrorists don't have the kind of...</i>
-Shh.

186
00:16:28,845 --> 00:16:32,282
-Major routes around the
airport are shut down until further notice.

187
00:16:32,306 --> 00:16:33,583
-Understood. I...I need to get

188
00:16:33,608 --> 00:16:35,626
back home and I'm off...I'm
off the next exit.

189
00:16:35,636 --> 00:16:37,337
-You're gonna have to find another way.

190
00:16:37,408 --> 00:16:39,048
-Well, there is no
other way.

191
00:16:39,072 --> 00:16:41,368
-What can I tell you, man?
it's a madhouse out there.

192
00:16:41,392 --> 00:16:43,392

00:18:02,197 --> 00:18:03,197
<i>-Oh no.</i>

209
00:18:24,782 --> 00:18:26,587
What the hell...

210
00:19:00,062 --> 00:19:01,262
-David?
-April...

211
00:19:03,211 --> 00:19:04,211
Are you home?

212
00:19:04,328 --> 00:19:05,328

00:19:12,429 --> 00:19:13,563
<i>-I'm coming home.</i>

216
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:14,945
-What?

217
00:19:16,312 --> 00:19:17,312
-Baby...

218
00:20:03,897 --> 00:20:05,763
-Did you and Sam fight a lot?

219
00:20:06,147 --> 00:20:07,303
-I know it's a lot.

220
00:20:08,092 --> 00:20:09,339
My mama always said

221
00:20:09,364 --> 00:20:12,449
'When you ain't fighting,
you ain't talking."

222
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,510
-My parents...

223
00:20:13,689 --> 00:20:15,525
They never seem to
be in different places.

224
00:20:15,853 --> 00:20:18,509
And with David it
always seems like that.

225
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,652
-Where did you come from?

226
00:20:39,368 --> 00:20:41,978
Haven't you been seeing
everything that's been happening?

227
00:20:42,003 --> 00:20:44,586
-I'm just trying to get back home.
-Bad idea.

228
00:20:45,336 --> 00:20:48,641
I mean, all the protection you're
going to have is at the evacuation point.

229
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,115
You might just stay there.

230
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,815
-I'm not far from the
north end of the valley.

231
00:20:53,354 --> 00:20:55,706
I need to find my family.
-There's nothing there.

232
00:20:58,734 --> 00:20:59,734
-What?

233
00:21:01,133 --> 00:21:02,400
-Everything's gone.

234
00:21:03,406 --> 00:21:04,473
Everyone's dead.

235
00:21:06,909 --> 00:21:08,109
-Shouldn't be.

236
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:09,797
My wife is still there.

237
00:21:13,312 --> 00:21:15,112
-The entire valley is gone.

238
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:20,708
-Amy.

246

-Excuse me!

247
00:22:00,309 --> 00:22:01,309
Hello!!

248
00:22:05,441 --> 00:22:06,575
Where's your car?

249
00:22:08,051 --> 00:22:10,117
How did you even
get out here?

250
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:16,606
Look...um...

251
00:22:17,716 --> 00:22:20,700
If you need a ride, I
can give you a ride to the next town.

252
00:22:23,911 --> 00:22:26,372
You know, there is probably
someone in the next town that can

253
00:22:26,396 --> 00:22:28,396
help you and they
might even have a phone.

254
00:22:28,818 --> 00:22:29,818
Um...

255
00:22:31,341 --> 00:22:32,608
I don't want any...

256
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:34,279
Hey.

257
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:36,630
Um...

258
00:22:38,474 --> 00:22:39,474
okay.

259
00:22:55,652 --> 00:22:57,652
So uh...you from
around here?

260
00:23:21,097 --> 00:23:22,097
Finally.

261
00:23:22,886 --> 00:23:26,268
All this time and no other
 cars in the road, it's just...

262
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:27,573
just too weird.

263
00:23:32,757 --> 00:23:33,757
Look...uh...

264
00:23:33,991 --> 00:23:35,924
are you on something? 'Cause

265
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:38,123
this is starting to get really old.
-Light.

266
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:40,116
-Yeah, they got lights.

267
00:23:40,141 --> 00:23:42,663
Looks like they've set up a roadblock.
-What?

268
00:23:44,749 --> 00:23:46,514
-What...What is wrong
with you, okay?

269
00:23:46,538 --> 00:23:48,100
Why...why do you keep
mentioning light? What about light?

270
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:50,428
-Light!
-What about the damn light?

271
00:23:56,492 --> 00:23:58,265
-Okay hold up.
let's get this guy out.

272
00:23:58,523 --> 00:24:01,046
We'll take him and whoever
needs medical attention first.

273
00:24:43,432 --> 00:24:44,432
-Need any help?

274
00:24:44,619 --> 00:24:46,408
-Hey I got this!
-Look, look, I just want to get

275
00:24:46,433 --> 00:24:49,838
home to my family.
-Roads are closed to all westbound traffic.

276
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:51,688
It's all I can tell you.

277
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:54,459
What's wrong with that guy?

278
00:24:54,482 --> 00:24:57,563
-I...I don't know. I saw him
outside the tunnel, I picked him up

279
00:24:57,588 --> 00:25:00,808
And he...this guy keeps freaking
out about...about a light.

280
00:25:01,229 --> 00:25:02,985
You know...maybe I can
leave him here with you

281
00:25:02,997 --> 00:25:04,877
guys and...and...
someone...till someone comes...

282
00:25:04,902 --> 00:25:07,236
-No sir that's not gonna work.
We can't do that.

283
00:25:08,232 --> 00:25:09,232
-Hey!!!

284

-Hey, sir!

285
00:25:11,002 --> 00:25:12,544
You're gonna have to
keep moving

286
00:25:12,569 --> 00:25:15,416
You're going to have to
get back and drop him off...

287
00:25:18,053 --> 00:25:19,381
-What the hell are you doing?

288
00:25:20,069 --> 00:25:21,069
Please.

289
00:25:22,412 --> 00:25:23,412
They're here.

290
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:32,896
-How far are we talking?

291
00:26:09,577 --> 00:26:10,777
You see something?

292
00:27:06,652 --> 00:27:07,652
-David?

293
00:27:10,746 --> 00:27:12,346

to the hospital.

296
00:27:23,504 --> 00:27:25,714
-I can't see waiting...
-I'll get the car.

297
00:27:25,738 --> 00:27:27,738
-No, you stay here.

298
00:27:27,965 --> 00:27:29,636
-Why wouldn't you let me take you?

299
00:27:30,754 --> 00:27:31,754
-Enough.

300
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:33,769
Just listen.

301
00:27:34,809 --> 00:27:36,339
-We had these drawn up.

-Powers of attorney?

303
00:27:42,104 --> 00:27:43,304
-And living wills.

Right, let's go.

Drive, get out of here!

-Wait, wait, wait...there
still might be people out there.

332

-No, there's no way...
-We have to wait!

333

-No! there's no...I'm telling
you there's no point!

334

-Of course there's a point!

335
00:34:51,755 --> 00:34:53,957
-No, I'm not being
heartless, I'm being reasonable.

336
00:34:53,981 --> 00:34:56,191
Come on, we're gonna get
killed if we sit here.

337
00:34:57,942 --> 00:34:58,942
-That's them.

338

-It's okay.

-<i>What's</i> okay?

344
00:35:50,378 --> 00:35:52,822
We just left all
those people out there to die.

345
00:35:52,847 --> 00:35:54,433
-We didn't have time.
They would have killed us too.

346
00:35:54,457 --> 00:35:57,050
-I...I could have waited.
 I could have fit a few of them.

347
00:35:57,074 --> 00:35:58,823
-They were already dead.
-That's bullshit!

348
00:35:59,277 --> 00:36:00,277
Okay?

349
00:36:01,144 --> 00:36:03,144
Alright. We saw
them running.

350
00:36:04,351 --> 00:36:05,951
I saw them running and I

351
00:36:06,476 --> 00:36:08,142
I can't make that excuse.

352
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,040
-It's just how it is.

353
00:36:14,335 --> 00:36:17,264
-How can you act like that
when there's innocent people being killed?

354
00:36:17,288 --> 00:36:19,489
-Hey! If you've been in
your car this whole time,

355
00:36:19,514 --> 00:36:21,759
let me tell you: you have
some shit ahead of you.

356
00:36:22,196 --> 00:36:25,938
I've seen enough death in the
last 24 hours to know how to save myself.

357
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:29,893
I'm not trying to be
heartless, just...

358
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:36,223
Is that your family?

359
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:39,296
-It's my wife.

360
00:36:42,183 --> 00:36:43,383
-Do you have kids?

361
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:47,199
-No.

362
00:36:48,222 --> 00:36:50,289
-Could you imagine
if you did?

363
00:36:50,754 --> 00:36:53,151
In a time like this
how would you explain it to them?

364
00:36:54,085 --> 00:36:55,751
First we'll protect them.

365
00:36:56,309 --> 00:36:57,489
-You mean Amy?

366
00:37:01,083 --> 00:37:02,883
-What were you waiting for?

367
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,020
-What?

368
00:37:04,184 --> 00:37:06,957
-You and your wife.
Why were you waiting to have kids?

369
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,246
-Isn't it a bit forward
on you, don't you think?

370
00:37:11,065 --> 00:37:12,354
-I'm just talking.

371
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,510
-I know that we never
even wanted kids.

372
00:37:19,371 --> 00:37:21,652
-You're married. That's
just what other people want from you.

373
00:37:21,676 --> 00:37:23,676
Okay, so what was your excuse then?

374
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:26,410
-I don't know.

375
00:37:27,848 --> 00:37:30,048
I guess first it was work mostly.

376
00:37:32,054 --> 00:37:33,054
Well, full time,

377
00:37:34,171 --> 00:37:35,705
then you're overtime...

378
00:37:38,921 --> 00:37:40,741
I don't know. I...I
guess we both just wanted

379
00:37:40,765 --> 00:37:42,921
to get to a certain point
before we felt like we could

380
00:37:43,718 --> 00:37:45,652
you know...settle down and...

381
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:49,725
eventually.

382
00:37:51,194 --> 00:37:52,194
-Eventually...

383
00:37:55,538 --> 00:37:58,943
So you really think you're
gonna find your wife in all this mess?

384
00:37:59,124 --> 00:38:00,124
-Yes.

385
00:38:04,134 --> 00:38:07,000
-If I were you, I'd
prepare myself not to.

386
00:38:08,109 --> 00:38:11,176
-You know what? I...
I don't need this. Okay?

387
00:38:11,201 --> 00:38:12,977
Don't talk like that.
-I'm not trying...

388
00:38:13,002 --> 00:38:15,002
-No, it's none of your business.

389
00:38:15,709 --> 00:38:17,042
She's...she's smart.

390
00:38:17,568 --> 00:38:19,168
Alright? She'll be fine.

391
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:21,498
-Alright.

392
00:38:22,013 --> 00:38:24,013
-She...she could be out there.

393
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:28,416
But I don't think that it's
a good idea for you to go looking for her.

394
00:38:28,995 --> 00:38:30,822
-Well, thank you for your sympathy.

395
00:38:31,088 --> 00:38:32,568
-It would just...it
would be nice to save

396
00:38:32,594 --> 00:38:34,307
just one life today.
that's all I'm saying.

397
00:38:34,901 --> 00:38:35,901
-I'll be fine.

398
00:38:45,644 --> 00:38:47,159
-I'm Samantha.

399
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:51,495
-I'm David.

400
00:39:08,941 --> 00:39:09,941
-Hi.

401
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,293
-Whew. Thank God!

402
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:13,019
Are you okay?

403
00:39:13,785 --> 00:39:14,785
<i>-Yeah.</i>

404
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,011
-I got a hell of a
time getting ahold of you,

405
00:39:18,115 --> 00:39:20,786
-Yeah, the news said that
most of the cellphone towers are down.

406
00:39:21,849 --> 00:39:23,419
<i>-And most of the
roads are closed, too.</i>

407
00:39:27,748 --> 00:39:29,014
Is everything okay?

408
00:39:31,779 --> 00:39:32,779
-No...

409
00:39:32,958 --> 00:39:33,958
-Are you hurt?

410
00:39:37,146 --> 00:39:38,317
-Kailey's sick.

411
00:39:38,888 --> 00:39:39,888
She...

412
00:39:40,982 --> 00:39:43,286
She couldn't move her body,
she couldn't...

413
00:39:43,529 --> 00:39:45,567
I don't know what was wrong with her.

414
00:39:46,822 --> 00:39:47,822
-Where is she?

415
00:39:51,135 --> 00:39:53,668
-Um...a neighbor took
her to the vet.

416
00:40:01,304 --> 00:40:03,037
-Thank God you're alright.

417
00:40:03,546 --> 00:40:04,952
-Wait, wait, wait.
What time is it?

418
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,881
-Almost three.

419
00:40:07,757 --> 00:40:10,335
I couldn't wait. After
last night, I had to see you.

420
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:12,550
-Well, what's been happening?

421
00:40:13,062 --> 00:40:14,311
-Haven't you seen the news?

422
00:40:14,522 --> 00:40:17,671
-I fell asleep. Is it... I
mean, did I miss something?

423
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:20,749
-Let's just get you some coffee.

424
00:40:20,774 --> 00:40:23,074
You have no idea how
good it is to be here.

425
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,191
<i>-It could be something atmospheric...</i>

426
00:40:27,214 --> 00:40:28,901
<i>okay, that's causing
planes to crash,</i>

427
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,753
<i>It could be something
extraterrestrial,</i>

428
00:40:30,778 --> 00:40:32,839
<i>basically it's beyond
our field of vision right now.</i>

429
00:40:32,864 --> 00:40:36,165
<i>It's a Black Swan event and
we're not equipped to deal with it.</i>

430
00:40:40,564 --> 00:40:41,680
-The neighbor's a vet.

431
00:40:42,212 --> 00:40:43,790
He works out of his house

432
00:40:43,814 --> 00:40:45,282
and I take her.

433
00:40:46,329 --> 00:40:48,462
-Wait, I...I can't leave.

434
00:40:50,634 --> 00:40:52,641
Not with everything
that's going on.

435
00:40:52,704 --> 00:40:54,399
-What could possibly
happen here?

436
00:40:54,658 --> 00:40:55,725
-I don't know...

437
00:40:55,748 --> 00:40:57,748
I can't not be here if

438
00:40:57,931 --> 00:40:59,331
they come back and...

439
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:03,415
I don't...I don't know
what to do.

440
00:41:27,827 --> 00:41:29,975
-When I was driving
over here today,

441
00:41:32,131 --> 00:41:34,654
there was only one thing
that I could think of.

442
00:41:35,787 --> 00:41:38,685
All the money, all the
success, it meant nothing,

443
00:41:39,154 --> 00:41:43,708
The only thing that mattered to me was
 that I got one more chance to see you

444
00:41:43,732 --> 00:41:46,872
and tell you that the only
way that anything could matter again

445
00:41:47,294 --> 00:41:49,286
was if we could
share it together.

446
00:41:50,279 --> 00:41:51,279
You and me.

447
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,560
-I can't.

448
00:41:55,748 --> 00:41:56,748
-Yes you can.

449
00:41:58,357 --> 00:42:00,957
And you know what you have, right here.

450
00:42:01,473 --> 00:42:03,673
I know.
-Don't. That's not fair.

451
00:42:03,698 --> 00:42:05,958
-None of this is fair, Amy.

452
00:42:08,537 --> 00:42:12,419
You don't know how much time you
have left with everything that's going on.

453
00:42:14,645 --> 00:42:15,879
I <i>want</i> this.

454
00:42:17,216 --> 00:42:18,216
<i>I want this.</i>

455
00:42:18,333 --> 00:42:20,260
-I...I have to stay.

456
00:42:20,285 --> 00:42:23,379
Even if it's a small
chance, I have to.

457
00:42:27,005 --> 00:42:28,005
-If I leave,

458
00:42:28,857 --> 00:42:30,390
right now, without you,

459
00:42:30,911 --> 00:42:34,511
there is no way that
we can know what could happen.

460
00:42:41,348 --> 00:42:42,348
<i>-I can't...</i>

461
00:42:50,989 --> 00:42:51,989
<i>-That's good.</i>

462
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:53,778
<i>It's good.</i>

463
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:55,840
<i>She's gonna be okay.</i>

464
00:42:56,973 --> 00:42:58,107
Just stay inside.

465
00:42:58,622 --> 00:42:59,622
Okay?

466
00:43:04,528 --> 00:43:07,863
Look, babe, I'm having a really
hard time staying awake.

467
00:43:07,981 --> 00:43:09,805
I mean I'm just gonna...I'm
gonna pull over

468
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:11,528
really quick and just
take a quick nap.

469
00:43:12,064 --> 00:43:13,064
<i>I'm tired.</i>

470
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:18,017
<i>Look, I'm going to
make it back to you, okay?</i>

471
00:43:18,189 --> 00:43:20,150
I'm going to make
it back to you.

472
00:43:20,924 --> 00:43:21,924
You trust me?

473
00:43:26,017 --> 00:43:27,017
-I trust you.

474
00:43:30,603 --> 00:43:32,470
<i>-Everything's gonna be okay.</i>

475
00:44:15,409 --> 00:44:18,736
Well, Samantha, no...
no kids, eh?

476
00:44:20,955 --> 00:44:21,955
-No.

477
00:44:23,393 --> 00:44:24,588
-Did you have an excuse?

478
00:44:28,246 --> 00:44:29,246
-Well, when I first

479
00:44:30,987 --> 00:44:32,346
got married, we

480
00:44:32,885 --> 00:44:34,085
said that we would

481
00:44:34,635 --> 00:44:37,697
wait until we could afford
to get a pool for the backyard.

482
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:41,944
But I don't think
that was it.

483
00:44:43,104 --> 00:44:45,057
He got a good job and...

484
00:44:45,081 --> 00:44:47,150
I got a better job.
We surpassed that.

485
00:44:47,612 --> 00:44:49,299
We didn't get the
pool for the backyard.

486
00:44:50,448 --> 00:44:52,322
We stopped talking
about having kids.

487
00:44:55,205 --> 00:44:57,205
It's so interesting, isn't it?

488
00:44:59,373 --> 00:45:01,895
What people think marriage
is for at the beginning?

489
00:45:03,849 --> 00:45:04,849
it's like a...

490
00:45:06,029 --> 00:45:08,145
a free ticket out
of our old life.

491
00:45:08,169 --> 00:45:09,825
It's always gonna be better.

492
00:45:10,427 --> 00:45:12,974
Or at least you're not
gonna grow old and

493
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,811
die alone with no one
beside you.

494
00:45:21,591 --> 00:45:23,055
But for me that

495
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:26,843
that...that feeling

496
00:45:29,094 --> 00:45:31,294
comes from disappointing someone,

497
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:39,865
that...that never really went away for me.

498
00:45:40,475 --> 00:45:42,609
Even...even in the
good times.

499
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:48,186
We were married seven years.

500
00:45:49,998 --> 00:45:51,866
We had the divorce papers

501
00:45:52,257 --> 00:45:53,457
all ready to sign

502
00:45:54,764 --> 00:45:56,459
before all this

503
00:45:57,733 --> 00:45:58,733
happened.

504
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,544
With the strange timing
pf it all I still managed

505
00:46:07,232 --> 00:46:08,232
to become

506
00:46:09,006 --> 00:46:10,006
separated.

507
00:46:13,643 --> 00:46:17,310
All these feelings that
you have in the end shouldn't

508
00:46:17,666 --> 00:46:19,733
shouldn't make up
for all the

509
00:46:20,135 --> 00:46:21,135
boredom and

510
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:22,847
disappointment that

511
00:46:24,026 --> 00:46:25,814
that you felt before.

512
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:27,330
Should they?

513
00:46:38,792 --> 00:46:43,463
-You know that...software I got you last
year makes changing music much easier.

514
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,495
-But there's no
connection to the notes.

515
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:49,519
I...I like writing by hand.

516
00:46:51,069 --> 00:46:53,602
-Well, I was going to
take Kylie out,

517
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:55,319
Decompress a bit.

518
00:46:56,006 --> 00:46:57,959
Do you want to take
a break and come along?

519
00:47:00,556 --> 00:47:01,689
-You know, I'm...

520
00:47:01,713 --> 00:47:03,713
I'm kind of at a place
where I shouldn't stop.

521
00:47:04,001 --> 00:47:05,001
<i>Please.</i>

522
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:07,782
-Yeah, no problem.

523
00:48:27,099 --> 00:48:28,731
-I'm taking a job with Brad.

524
00:48:32,193 --> 00:48:33,726
-Oh, so that's it then?

525
00:48:34,162 --> 00:48:35,162
You've decided?

526
00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:38,290
-One of us has to do something.

527
00:48:38,603 --> 00:48:41,023
One last thing for us
to not talk about.

528
00:48:42,024 --> 00:48:43,484
-Come on. Seriously?

529
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:47,297
It's not always like this.
-I know how it is.

530
00:48:52,845 --> 00:48:54,378
-I have to go to Denver.

531
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:59,378
-Maybe that's best.

532
00:49:36,297 --> 00:49:37,297
-Hello?

533
00:49:38,117 --> 00:49:39,117
<i>-I wasted it.</i>

534
00:49:40,774 --> 00:49:42,174
-Ryan, where are you?

535
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:44,750
<i>-I'm alone.</i>

536
00:49:46,422 --> 00:49:48,226
And you know
who gives a shit?

537
00:49:49,594 --> 00:49:50,594
<i>No one.</i>

538
00:49:52,266 --> 00:49:53,781
-Settle down, you've been drinking....

539
00:49:53,805 --> 00:49:56,164
-Damn right. I've been drinking.

540
00:50:00,223 --> 00:50:02,395
No one even knows
I'm here, Amy.

541
00:50:04,458 --> 00:50:05,791
Tori's probably dead

542
00:50:06,043 --> 00:50:07,348
<i>and David bailed.</i>

543
00:50:08,747 --> 00:50:10,684
<i>...and it hits me</i>

544
00:50:11,715 --> 00:50:12,941
I've got

545
00:50:14,176 --> 00:50:15,176
nothing.

546
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:32,284
<i>Hey, hey...it's
okay. Hey, Hey.</i>

547
00:50:33,129 --> 00:50:34,949
<i>Hey there...hi.</i>

548
00:50:34,972 --> 00:50:37,464
<i>Um...where's your
family at?</i>

549
00:50:39,433 --> 00:50:43,167
<i>I don't know where my
family is either. Can I sit here?</i>

550
00:50:45,589 --> 00:50:48,456
It looks like you
have an <i>owey</i> there, huh?

551
00:50:49,435 --> 00:50:50,435
David...

552
00:50:51,911 --> 00:50:53,511
Is he...is he
home yet?

553
00:50:55,356 --> 00:50:56,889
<i>Oh, let me take a look.</i>

554
00:50:56,914 --> 00:50:58,914
<i>Oh, it's gonna be okay.</i>

555
00:50:59,708 --> 00:51:01,716
Oh! Is that your bow?

556
00:51:05,052 --> 00:51:07,052
Can you hold this here for me?

557
00:51:11,271 --> 00:51:12,271
You know...

558
00:51:12,759 --> 00:51:15,226
I can be looking
to find my family a

559
00:51:15,283 --> 00:51:16,415
a long time, so

560
00:51:16,439 --> 00:51:18,141
maybe we should just try and

561
00:51:18,165 --> 00:51:19,399
try and find yours, okay?

562
00:51:20,822 --> 00:51:22,821
You know...what  direction
 do you think they went?

563
00:51:23,558 --> 00:51:24,825
Oh, that way? Okay.

564
00:51:27,371 --> 00:51:28,371
Come here.

565
00:51:28,636 --> 00:51:29,636
Come here.

566
00:51:35,331 --> 00:51:36,972
<i>How did he know it's over?</i>

567
00:51:38,699 --> 00:51:40,409
-What?
-David?

568
00:51:42,707 --> 00:51:44,551
He knows it's over
between you two.

569
00:51:45,934 --> 00:51:48,001
He told me how rough it's been.

570
00:52:28,003 --> 00:52:29,003
-Of course.

571
00:52:29,933 --> 00:52:30,933
<i>Damn it.</i>

572
00:52:47,889 --> 00:52:49,833
What are you...doing?

573
00:53:08,913 --> 00:53:09,913
-Are you okay?

574
00:53:13,116 --> 00:53:15,053
What are you doing
out here alone?

575
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:17,473
Where's your family?

576
00:53:20,866 --> 00:53:22,133
-Get away from her!

577
00:53:26,233 --> 00:53:29,499
-I was just trying to
make sure she was alright!

578
00:53:33,319 --> 00:53:34,677
I am on your side!

579
00:53:36,561 --> 00:53:38,084
Does your phone work?

580
00:53:44,269 --> 00:53:45,269
Hello!

581
00:53:58,929 --> 00:53:59,929
Is she okay?

582
00:54:01,101 --> 00:54:02,234
-Get out of here!

583
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:06,033
-I just want to get home.

584
00:54:06,452 --> 00:54:09,319
Do you know the quickest
way to Salt Lake?

585
00:54:11,664 --> 00:54:15,984
-Get...off...my...land!

586
00:54:16,039 --> 00:54:17,468
-Okay, alright.

587
00:54:18,078 --> 00:54:19,078
You got it.

588
00:54:20,047 --> 00:54:21,980
I'm just gonna get some water

589
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:23,947
And then I'm leaving.

590
00:54:29,143 --> 00:54:30,810
I really appreciate this.

591
00:54:37,864 --> 00:54:38,864
-No! No!

592
00:54:43,564 --> 00:54:44,564
it's in the water.

593
00:54:48,122 --> 00:54:50,122
Whatever they're bringing, its

594
00:54:53,887 --> 00:54:56,021
They put something in the water!

595
00:55:01,405 --> 00:55:02,738
They got my animals.

596
00:55:05,897 --> 00:55:07,230
They took my family.

597
00:55:10,826 --> 00:55:12,326
They ain't getting no more!

598
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,728
-So who's...who's 'they'?

599
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:33,650
<i>Jesus...</i>

600
00:55:35,338 --> 00:55:36,338
What is this?

601
00:55:37,283 --> 00:55:38,283
-In or out?

602
00:55:38,939 --> 00:55:39,939
Let's go!

603
00:56:01,711 --> 00:56:04,773
Those bastards want a fight;
they got it.

604
00:56:16,448 --> 00:56:18,515
-Damn it, Kate! I said no more!

605
00:56:18,539 --> 00:56:20,539
No more! No more.

606
00:56:50,014 --> 00:56:52,281
<i>Anything comes through
that door,</i>

607
00:56:52,468 --> 00:56:54,068
<i>I'm emptying this thing.</i>

608
00:57:06,217 --> 00:57:07,217
<i>Shit...</i>

609
00:57:07,858 --> 00:57:09,925
<i>I forgot to lock the back door.</i>

610
00:57:51,682 --> 00:57:52,682
<i>Shit!</i>

611
00:57:55,744 --> 00:57:57,708
Caitlin, no! Stop!

612
00:58:01,643 --> 00:58:02,902
-Ah!!!!!

613
00:58:03,323 --> 00:58:04,323
Ah!!!!!

614
00:58:12,838 --> 00:58:13,838
Ow!!

615
00:58:16,057 --> 00:58:17,595
Ah...Ah!!!!

616
00:58:18,596 --> 00:58:19,596
Ah!!!

617
00:58:31,544 --> 00:58:32,544
-Sam!!

618
00:58:46,465 --> 00:58:47,465
-Lori?

619
00:58:47,848 --> 00:58:48,848
Lori!

620
00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:50,216
Sam, what happened?

621
00:58:50,809 --> 00:58:51,809
Sam!

622
00:58:54,067 --> 00:58:55,480
Someone help us!

623
00:58:56,989 --> 00:58:58,324
Tell him I'm
gonna go get my keys.

624
00:58:58,348 --> 00:59:00,348
Dan, you stay with her, okay?

625
00:59:05,484 --> 00:59:06,484
<i>-No!</i>

626
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:08,788
<i>No!</i>

627
00:59:16,589 --> 00:59:18,011
-Brad wants to start
a firm with me.

628
00:59:19,027 --> 00:59:20,027
-That was pretty quick.

629
00:59:21,214 --> 00:59:22,348
What about Chemtech?

630
00:59:23,597 --> 00:59:25,721
-He quit...two weeks ago.

631
00:59:25,902 --> 00:59:27,995
And he already has
everything in place.

632
00:59:28,339 --> 00:59:30,073
New office, new clients...

633
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,353
It'll be...smaller, but...

634
00:59:32,394 --> 00:59:34,394
I mean something.

635
00:59:34,418 --> 00:59:36,418
I'll actually feel
like I'm making a difference.

636
00:59:36,442 --> 00:59:38,917
-Well, what about things around here?

637
00:59:41,855 --> 00:59:43,121
-That is so unfair.

638
00:59:43,683 --> 00:59:44,683
-What?

639
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:48,557
-Don't make me feel
guilty about this.

640
00:59:49,175 --> 00:59:50,908
What have you done for us?

641
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:54,502
-I'm going to that wedding with
you tomorrow, I mean that's....

642
00:59:54,518 --> 00:59:55,785
-She's your <i>cousin.</i>

643
00:59:56,901 --> 00:59:58,479
Did you quit <i>your</i> job?

644
00:59:58,745 --> 01:00:00,545
Or put <i>your</i> dreams on hold?

645
01:00:01,155 --> 01:00:02,983
Have you done anything for us?

646
01:00:03,062 --> 01:00:04,862
-I've cut way back on work!

647
01:00:05,164 --> 01:00:06,164
You know that!

648
01:00:06,515 --> 01:00:08,226
-Then where are you every day?

649
01:00:08,343 --> 01:00:09,343
Every night?

650
01:00:09,703 --> 01:00:12,116
-Just give me a
minute, okay? I got...

651
01:00:12,953 --> 01:00:15,147
-I can't compete with
your damn phone!

652
01:00:16,023 --> 01:00:17,156
I...I...I'm done.

653
01:00:18,078 --> 01:00:20,202
-Okay fine! It's off now!

654
01:00:20,570 --> 01:00:22,171
Now everything is
going to be better!

655
01:00:24,296 --> 01:00:25,905
Maybe now with
my phone off.

656
01:00:25,929 --> 01:00:28,210
we might be able to
have a conversation at dinner!

657
01:00:28,312 --> 01:00:30,343
Or no, maybe all
our fights

658
01:00:30,507 --> 01:00:32,358
will turn into polite discussions!

659
01:00:32,718 --> 01:00:35,515
I...I should have known
this whole time it would be this phone!

660
01:00:35,539 --> 01:00:37,233
The phone is the only problem!

661
01:00:37,257 --> 01:00:39,257
It's just the phone!

662
01:02:22,703 --> 01:02:23,703
-David?

663
01:02:26,007 --> 01:02:27,874
Do you want me to take over?

664
01:02:30,078 --> 01:02:31,078
-No, I'm good.

665
01:02:32,061 --> 01:02:33,881
-I think I know
where we are now.

666
01:02:33,906 --> 01:02:36,155
I can get us into the valley
 if you want to take a nap.

667
01:02:37,398 --> 01:02:38,465
-It's okay, I...

668
01:02:39,138 --> 01:02:40,471
No really, I'm good.

669
01:02:42,302 --> 01:02:43,302
-Shit!

670
01:02:47,685 --> 01:02:48,685
What was that?

671
01:02:55,497 --> 01:02:56,697
Was that a person?

672
01:02:57,927 --> 01:02:59,497
-I didn't get a
good look, okay?

673
01:03:33,038 --> 01:03:34,238
-It's one of them.

674
01:03:36,202 --> 01:03:37,202
-We gotta go.

675
01:03:40,514 --> 01:03:41,514
-Wait, no.

676
01:03:43,725 --> 01:03:44,725
-Why?

677
01:03:47,639 --> 01:03:49,818
Samantha , come on, we don't
have time for this.

678
01:03:56,303 --> 01:03:58,103
I'm not gonna pick that up.

679
01:03:58,748 --> 01:04:01,475
-How else are you gonna
protect yourself? Think about it.

680
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:36,583
-No, no, no...

681
01:04:37,122 --> 01:04:38,927
Oh, shit.
-Oh my God.

682
01:04:39,263 --> 01:04:40,730
-Shit!
-What's wrong?

683
01:04:40,755 --> 01:04:41,755
-Come on!

684
01:04:43,833 --> 01:04:44,833
-What?

685
01:04:44,943 --> 01:04:45,943
- it is not working.

686
01:04:48,214 --> 01:04:49,214
Shit!

687
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:51,052
What's that?

688
01:06:32,026 --> 01:06:33,307
<i>-Oh, God.</i>

689
01:06:36,589 --> 01:06:38,557
<i>-Let's just leave
him there.</i>

690
01:06:40,151 --> 01:06:42,087
- ??? something different.

691
01:06:47,575 --> 01:06:50,042
-Well, how far do
you think we have?

692
01:06:51,208 --> 01:06:53,332
-Four or five miles probably.

693
01:06:54,723 --> 01:06:56,923
-Alright, let's get
out of here.

694
01:06:57,001 --> 01:06:58,001
-Okay.

695
01:07:18,831 --> 01:07:20,361
-So you know this road?

696
01:07:20,924 --> 01:07:21,924
-Yeah...

697
01:07:22,346 --> 01:07:23,413
I'm pretty sure.

698
01:07:25,956 --> 01:07:26,956
-Okay.

699
01:07:27,776 --> 01:07:29,243
-It's somewhere, okay?

700
01:07:29,495 --> 01:07:31,627
If it's not at the mouth of canyon,
that's close.

701
01:07:32,409 --> 01:07:33,409
-Well, what if it isn't?

702
01:07:34,354 --> 01:07:36,658
-Then I'll keep walking
till I find it.

703
01:07:36,698 --> 01:07:39,330
-Well, what if there is
no evacuation point?

704
01:07:42,319 --> 01:07:44,453
-If there isn't,
then I'm dead.

705
01:07:48,812 --> 01:07:49,812
-You know...

706
01:07:50,132 --> 01:07:51,532
You can sleep with me

707
01:07:51,687 --> 01:07:52,687
if you want...

708
01:07:53,397 --> 01:07:54,397
-Thanks.

709
01:07:58,546 --> 01:08:01,280
-I just don't understand
how you're so comfortable

710
01:08:01,413 --> 01:08:02,946
with the idea of death.

711
01:08:03,585 --> 01:08:05,118
-The same goes for you.

712
01:08:05,601 --> 01:08:07,334
-I'm not comfortable
with the idea of death. I...

713
01:08:07,835 --> 01:08:09,368
Are you...are you okay?

714
01:08:10,624 --> 01:08:11,624
Are you hurt?

715
01:08:12,030 --> 01:08:14,077
-Uh, no, I just
wanted to lay down.

716
01:08:14,358 --> 01:08:15,952
Wow, that's so embarrassing.

717
01:08:16,671 --> 01:08:18,738
No, I'm fine.
-You tired or...

718
01:08:18,762 --> 01:08:20,762
-No, it's pretty nice
down here actually..

719
01:08:20,808 --> 01:08:22,277
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

720
01:08:26,933 --> 01:08:28,894
Are you gonna let
me look at that?

721
01:08:28,918 --> 01:08:30,918
Please?
-No, it's just...

722
01:08:31,004 --> 01:08:33,206
I'm alright.
-No, it needs to be cleaned.

723
01:08:34,316 --> 01:08:35,245
Maybe I...

724
01:08:35,271 --> 01:08:38,058
No, it's not gonna take that long and
you need to take a break anyway.

725
01:08:38,082 --> 01:08:39,308
Here.

726
01:08:39,394 --> 01:08:40,394
Okay.

727
01:08:40,418 --> 01:08:42,418
-So glad I found a doctor.

728
01:08:42,442 --> 01:08:45,847
-Shut up. I'm just tired
of you whip around everywhere.

729
01:08:46,308 --> 01:08:47,308
So...

730
01:08:52,019 --> 01:08:53,019
-So...

731
01:08:53,527 --> 01:08:55,660
-What do you want to talk about?

732
01:09:21,609 --> 01:09:23,542
<i>-They killed Sam and Maureen.</i>

733
01:09:23,567 --> 01:09:25,567
<i>They tried to kill me too, and I...</i>

734
01:09:27,859 --> 01:09:29,459
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

735
01:09:33,914 --> 01:09:36,632
I never thought I'd
have to prepare for this.

736
01:09:41,725 --> 01:09:42,982
I'm sorry...

737
01:09:45,225 --> 01:09:46,772
I was aware about Brad, he...

738
01:09:46,795 --> 01:09:48,795
he came over and I...

739
01:09:49,639 --> 01:09:53,039
He's been over before
and it didn't mean anything.

740
01:09:54,821 --> 01:09:56,805
-Sorry. Does it hurt?
Are you okay?

741
01:09:56,829 --> 01:09:58,829
-This feels great, yeah.

742
01:10:00,477 --> 01:10:01,477
-Okay...

743
01:10:03,110 --> 01:10:04,110
Come on...

744
01:10:04,672 --> 01:10:06,006
Talk to me for once.

745
01:10:08,297 --> 01:10:09,697
-I'll talk, I just...

746
01:10:10,461 --> 01:10:12,719
Don't have much to say.
-Now I know you're lying.

747
01:10:17,357 --> 01:10:18,423
What's Amy like?

748
01:10:20,825 --> 01:10:22,292
-She's...she's strong.

749
01:10:24,279 --> 01:10:25,786
And a lot  of other things.

750
01:10:29,138 --> 01:10:30,138
-Was she happy?

751
01:10:31,708 --> 01:10:32,708
-Um...

752
01:10:34,021 --> 01:10:35,554
That's a good question.

753
01:10:37,526 --> 01:10:39,592
You know, I
could guess but...

754
01:10:40,901 --> 01:10:42,434
I've been wrong before.

755
01:10:45,010 --> 01:10:46,543
She doesn't smile much,

756
01:10:47,854 --> 01:10:50,002
but she's always kind
of been that way.

757
01:10:50,916 --> 01:10:52,939
When I first me her,
I...I just...

758
01:10:53,432 --> 01:10:55,232
...thought she was unhappy.

759
01:10:57,385 --> 01:10:59,652
I guess everything's on me though.

760
01:11:02,198 --> 01:11:03,331
I messed up a lot.

761
01:11:07,034 --> 01:11:09,234
Especially in the beginning. I...

762
01:11:11,995 --> 01:11:13,128
I was unfaithful.

763
01:11:17,573 --> 01:11:19,106
One night I...told her.

764
01:11:20,518 --> 01:11:21,518
And then I just left.

765
01:11:22,667 --> 01:11:24,067
I...I didn't give her

766
01:11:24,214 --> 01:11:26,147
time to even react, I just...

767
01:11:26,284 --> 01:11:27,617
I didn't want to see her.

768
01:11:28,979 --> 01:11:31,299
So a few days later
I went to the house.

769
01:11:33,424 --> 01:11:34,424
And...um...

770
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:38,425
she met me at the door and...uh...

771
01:11:42,450 --> 01:11:43,809
she smiled.

772
01:11:45,653 --> 01:11:47,270
Quitting hadn't even
crossed her mind.

773
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:51,848
I um...

774
01:11:53,098 --> 01:11:54,098
I stayed.

775
01:11:56,184 --> 01:11:57,917
Felt like she deserved

776
01:11:58,090 --> 01:11:59,357
for me to not quit.

777
01:12:03,676 --> 01:12:04,676
-So you're

778
01:12:07,566 --> 01:12:11,233
looking for her so you can go
 sweep her off her feet?

779
01:12:13,465 --> 01:12:16,331
-No, I don't know
why I'm looking for her.

780
01:12:23,101 --> 01:12:25,568
I haven't been happy
in a long time.

781
01:12:27,531 --> 01:12:28,531
And uh...

782
01:12:29,719 --> 01:12:31,319
even if I <i>do</i> find her, I

783
01:12:32,289 --> 01:12:34,289
I don't know what will happen.

784
01:12:38,703 --> 01:12:41,170
-Maybe she doesn't
want to be found.

785
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,000
-She does.

786
01:13:03,276 --> 01:13:06,822
-Evacuation point Come on, hurry.

787
01:13:15,314 --> 01:13:18,540
-Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
-Hey! Hey! hey!

788
01:13:28,572 --> 01:13:30,853
-We're looking for the
evacuation point!

789
01:13:30,878 --> 01:13:33,728
-We got everyone out. ???

790
01:13:33,752 --> 01:13:35,900
-We got room, but
we got to go now!

791
01:13:35,924 --> 01:13:37,407
Come on!

792
01:13:37,877 --> 01:13:38,877
-David?!

793
01:13:39,025 --> 01:13:40,159
-Hey we gotta go!

794
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:42,189
-She's not there!
-How do you know that?

795
01:13:42,213 --> 01:13:44,213
-We're too far from home;
she can't be out here!

796
01:13:44,237 --> 01:13:47,986
-Come on! Everybody's dead
and I don't you to die!

797
01:14:00,405 --> 01:14:02,530
<i>-I hope you can find me...</i>

798
01:14:08,573 --> 01:14:09,773
-I can't die alone.

799
01:18:27,010 --> 01:18:29,026
-Hey stop! You gotta stop!

800
01:21:49,089 --> 01:21:50,089
The end
