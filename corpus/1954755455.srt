1
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,510
Thirty all.

2
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,750
Fault.

3
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,910
Out.

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,950
Er... 30-40.

5
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,910
Leave it.

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,950
I can manage.

7
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,910
-I thought that was supposed to be for Cecil.
-It bores him, I think.

8
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,630
Don't worry, he'll grow into it.

9
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,950
Bardner needs to set the table. Perhaps you'd better take it to the attic for now.

10
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,230
There's plenty of space up there.

11
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,270
All right.

12
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,470
.. by using information set out in tables, he can calculate his longitude.

13
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,930
Excuse me, Reverend Maskelyne, 

14
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,030
I shall have to let them in now.

15
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,190
May I have one minute, Dr Bliss?

16
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,230
Most certainly.

17
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,340
What are you going to do about your precious clocks?

18
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,030
Well,

19
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,660
I'm giving a talk to the Horological Society.

20
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,710
For money?

21
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,750
Of course not.

22
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,540
You can't just sit around here for the rest of your life, you know.

23
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,950
I do know.

24
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,710
-May I make a suggestion?
-Mm-hm?

25
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,510
Admiral Douglas had no right to stop your work.

26
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,300
It was all that publicity about your divorce that gave him the chance.

27
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,510
If you brought the matter to the attention of the navy board yourself,

28
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,550
he would have no legal argument.

29
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,590
You're saying that I should write to them?

30
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,830
Write to Douglas first,

31
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,990
hinting that you might,

32
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:20,710
but um... giving him the opportunity to um... change his mind.

33
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,270
But that would be blackmail.

34
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,310
Precisely.

35
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,070
I think that's rummy.

36
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,820
Dr Mayer's lunar tables allow the navigator 

37
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:36,420
to calculate his longitude at sea,

38
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,220
making allowances for both refraction and parallax distortion,

39
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,270
using simple trigonometry.

40
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,270
They suggest that the longitude problem is finally to be solved by a clock,

41
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,190
not a clumsy, man-made device of spinning wheels and levers,

42
00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:00,190
but a celestial clock, whose hands are the moon and whose numerals are the stars,

43
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,820
a dial writ across the sky by the Creator himself.

44
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,230
-What do you make of him?
-A lunatic, and a serious one.

45
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,270
Very good. Terribly good.

46
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,590
Thank you. My Lord Sandwich.

47
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,630
-Morton.
-You honour the Society.

48
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,710
I had thought you might be attending the opera again tonight.

49
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,150
No, my lord, but rest assured, the opera will be visiting me.

50
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,670
-Congratulations, sir. Most interesting.
-Thank you, Your Lordship.

51
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,710
The longitude prize is yours, then.

52
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,340
My lord, I am, I hope a scientist. Knowledge itself is my reward.

53
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,390
Oh, very good.

54
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,270
He has ability, that young man, but little sense.

55
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,430
-How long will it take to prove these tables?
-Oh, not so long. Four years, perhaps.

56
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,630
-Can he beat the old carpenter?
-Harrison? He has lost his way.

57
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,260
His third machine has defeated him, 

58
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,590
or so the rumour has it.

59
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,750
This Society was created 

60
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:06,510
so that men of science might solve the mysteries of our planet.

61
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,390
I would not wish to see the longitude prize stolen by a country tool-maker.

62
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,480
Did you find the paper of interest, Mr Harrison?

63
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,030
I certainly enjoyed the Reverend's enthusiasm for trigonometry at sea.

64
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,470
My lord, the moon may only be observed 20 days in every month,

65
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,390
and then only when there is no cloud.

66
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,830
It is not a practical solution for navigation.

67
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,530
Please forgive my son William, my lord.  

68
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,150
But he is right, Mr Harrison.

69
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,470
A practical solution is what we all seek.

70
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,430
Tell me, the Society's clock, is it still adjusted by celestial observation?

71
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,470
I believe it is sir. Why? Is your watch wrong?

72
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,100
No, my lord, it's almost right, 

73
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,200
which is much more curious, don't you agree?

74
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,990
-William.
-My lord.

75
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,590
-Four seconds.
-Still no change, then.

76
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,630
It's remarkable.

77
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,430
Mr Harrison, you asked to see me.

78
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,750
Mr Jefferies, I hoped you might be able to do some work for me.

79
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,870
I would be delighted.

80
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,710
Could you make me one of these?

81
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,790
I need the teeth to be set a little further apart.

82
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,110
I've done a sketch of the details.

83
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,150
Yes. Yes, that should be possible.

84
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,110
-Would next week be acceptable?
-Oh, yes, yes, of course. Thank you.

85
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,950
Oh, Mr Jefferies, your watch...

86
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,110
Is there a problem, Mr Harrison?

87
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,150
No, no. I'm quite pleased with it.

88
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,310
The modifications are encouraging.

89
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,230
I want to make another.

90
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,020
It must be a little larger, of course, to incorporate some changes I have in mind,

91
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,190
and I was wondering if you would consider assisting me.

92
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,270
-I would be happy to.
-Thank you, Mr Jefferies.

93
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,790
See you next week.

94
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,030
What are you doing?

95
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,070
I mean to make another.

96
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,990
But the third is almost ready. We cannot afford to be distracted now!

97
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,750
You've seen how the watch has performed in the test.

98
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,030
It's not perfect, but what if I could make it so?

99
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,030
What if I could make a timepiece no bigger than the span of a man's hand

100
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,070
that could be taken to sea?

101
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,590
Now, wouldn't that be a practical solution?

102
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,350
Harrison's fourth machine, by reason alike of its beauty and its accuracy,

103
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,310
must take pride of place as the most famous chronometer

104
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,470
that ever has been or ever will be made.

105
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,060
But the journey from his third machine, which you see behind me,

106
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,110
to his fourth, thank you,

107
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,350
is one of the most extraordinary mysteries in horology.

108
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,230
Faced as he was by a seemingly insuperable problem

109
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,550
of centrifugal forces, Harrison took a daring and lateral leap.

110
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:04,110
It is as though an aeronautical engineer suddenly ceased development on a new aircraft,

111
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,590
and, instead, adapted the technology to make his bicycle fly to France.

112
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,070
H4, as I've come to call it,

113
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,030
resembles a large, silver, pair case watch,

114
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,070
about five inches in diameter.

115
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:24,270
Indeed, it seems to have been designed for daily wear in the pocket of some Brobdingnagian.

116
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,310
At the moment, it's not working,

117
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,750
but that is a state of affairs that I hope, very shortly, to do something about.

118
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,630
We should be finishing our third machine, 

119
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,430
not wasting time on this deck watch.

120
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,470
Wasting our time?

121
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,310
The machine is almost ready for its sea trial.

122
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,860
We've not had time to conduct a 28-day test on this watch, 

123
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,070
let alone three- or six-month trial.

124
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,110
I'll go when I'm ready, and not before.

125
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,310
Then we need to apply for more money.

126
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,830
We cannot survive any longer on what we have.

127
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,800
Mr Jefferies at least should be paid, even if we are not.

128
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,790
-Are you unhappy, Mr Jefferies?
-Me, sir? No, sir.

129
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,550
There, you see?

130
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,470
Mr Gould, Francis Grey.

131
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,670
I enjoyed your talk very much.

132
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,180
I'm looking for people who can explain science in language 

133
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,500
that anybody can understand.

134
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,670
Children, for example.

135
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,070
-Do you have any of your own?
-Two, but we're separated.

136
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,110
-Not divorced?
-No.

137
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,550
Oh, well, that shouldn't be too much of a problem.

138
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,510
Next time you're in town, perhaps you'd care to come and see me.

139
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,060
-I'd like to talk to you about something.
-Certainly.

140
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,110
Oh, good. Here's my card.

141
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,150
You'll find me at the BBC.

142
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,110
-Mr Harrison.
-Reverend.

143
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,150
I think you know Captain Campbell.

144
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,630
Captain Campbell of His Majesty's ship Dorsetshire. Congratulations.

145
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,110
Captain Campbell has been assisting me in the testing of Dr Mayer's tables.

146
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,100
The Reverend is making me a mathematician.  

147
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,550
The results are very encouraging.

148
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,070
I've been commissioned by the Royal Society to go to St Helena to observe the transit of Venus,

149
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,190
so, on the way, I am to make further tests of the tables.

150
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,150
-What brings you here?
-We're applying for...

151
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,190
A trial.

152
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,230
A West Indies trial,

153
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,830
specified by the Act of Longitude.

154
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,510
That's great news, and not before time.

155
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,750
I'd almost given up on you, Mr Harrison.

156
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,910
I hope you will accept my services in any way I can be of assistance.

157
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,950
-Thank you.
-Mr Harrison.

158
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,990
Gentlemen.

159
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,350
-My lords, I have come... -For more money.

160
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,950
That is your normal reason for honouring our presence, 

161
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,830
is it not, Mr Harrison?

162
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,070
Your lordships, my third timepiece is completed.

163
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,290
I'm testing a fourth, 

164
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:17,200
which may be of great service with respect to the longitude.

165
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,830
My son has been urging me for some time to put them to trial.

166
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,110
I've decided to agree,

167
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,980
and wish to apply to take them to the West Indies.

168
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,470
What?! A West Indies trial?

169
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,020
You told me the machine was not even adjusted!

170
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,890
That is what I understood, my lord, 

171
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,660
but apparently he's making a new machine.

172
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,710
What did the Board resolve?

173
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,260
It was suggested that he travel to the West Indies

174
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,590
with Captain Campbell on the Dorsetshire.

175
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,960
If he has to have a trial, it mustn't be with Captain Campbell, 

176
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,110
who is his friend.

177
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,070
Maskelyne's trip to St Helena will take four months.

178
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,790
Harrison must not be permitted to return first.

179
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,030
We must find some other occupation for the Dorsetshire.

180
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,430
-With your permission, my lord. -Please, carry on.

181
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,390
Please, please, stay.

182
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,350
Observe. I think you'll find this most interesting.

183
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,070
This is the pineal gland, the gland that controls our emotions.

184
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,800
So, this is the first.

185
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,330
Yes, sir. My father took it to Lisbon when I were eight years old.

186
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:25,590
Beautiful. Quite beautiful.

187
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,870
-May I?
-Of course.

188
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,350
Oh! Remarkable!

189
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,390
It has kept time continuously for 24 years.

190
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,310
And this is the second, and this the third?

191
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,270
And this is our new watch.

192
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,510
Extraordinary!

193
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,350
I congratulate you, Mr Harrison.

194
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,950
-Which will you take to the Indies?
-I will take neither.

195
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,430
I'm an old man, not fit for a long journey.

196
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,470
Besides, I'm no sailor.

197
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,630
My son has an enthusiasm for the sea which I do not share.

198
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,990
-I shall send him in my stead.
-But you must be present for the trial.

199
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,430
My lord, as you know, we've had difficulty in finding a ship.

200
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,840
Mr Campbell wished to take us, 

201
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,550
but he was ordered away on other business.

202
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:22,230
The delay has, however, allowed me to continue testing my watch.

203
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,750
I'm pleased with it. Very pleased.

204
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,270
I shall keep the third machine here in London with me,

205
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,950
send the watch for test under the care of my son William.

206
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,990
Well, I hope to be of assistance.

207
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,930
I can't promise you 

208
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:38,390
a captain as sympathetic as John Campbell,

209
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,430
but I will do my best.

210
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,620
Thank you, my lord.

211
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,030
-What is their crime?
-Selling alcohol.

212
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,700
There's a rumour that the ship's beer is rotten 

213
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,990
and the men may be forced to drink water.

214
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:05,070
These three were caught selling their own brew at an exorbitant price.

215
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,230
Is water so terrible?

216
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,350
Mr Harrison! Please do not walk away!

217
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,460
It is a requirement that punishment should be witnessed by the whole crew.

218
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,190
Every stroke that you do not observe

219
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,270
will be taken again.

220
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,910
Thank you, gentlemen.

221
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,430
This is what I mean.

222
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,830
This is your water, sir.

223
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,390
This is what there is for the men to drink if the beer is foul.

224
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,430
How far do you reckon Madeira, Mr Learmouth?

225
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,510
Two days, travelling south-southwest.

226
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,800
Damn and blast the bloody purser.

227
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,910
We should all have dry throats by then.

228
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,470
I believe that we are closer than that, 

229
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:31,100
but the direction is due south.

230
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,670
Did you speak, Mr Harrison?

231
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,270
Well, according to the watch,

232
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,220
we should sight Porto Santo at dawn tomorrow 

233
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,670
if we hold our present course, due south.

234
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,030
I've checked the figures very carefully.

235
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,790
What do you say, gentlemen?

236
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,130
Mr Harrison, 

237
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:58,670
I don't pretend to understand your calculations,

238
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,070
but I'm under instruction to test your watch.

239
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,790
And test it we damn well shall.

240
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,710
Mr Learmouth, hold this course until tomorrow morning.

241
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,190
Yes, sir.

242
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,360
Send my compliments to the captain. 

243
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,990
I think he should come down here.

244
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,230
Pigswill!

245
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,150
Pour me a drink.

246
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,950
Neither myself nor my officers will drink anything this evening

247
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,630
other than the same water that is in front of you.

248
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,180
-It ain't fit for...
-Stop that man!

249
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,390
I will not tolerate being interrupted when I'm speaking!

250
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,780
Now, I am aware that what is in front of you

251
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,670
is not the sweetest of beverages,

252
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,720
but we have a guest on board our ship

253
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,830
under instruction from the Admiralty.

254
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,010
He has assured me that 

255
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:06,080
we will be able to take on fresh water tomorrow from Madeira.

256
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,870
He has a machine that has made this clear to him.

257
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,830
Is there anyone here who wishes to quarrel with Mr Harrison's machine?

258
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,230
Good.

259
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,500
Then kindly get on with your meal.

260
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,880
-Good morning, sir.
-Good morning, Captain.

261
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,390
-What time is it?
-Five.

262
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,830
Not long now, then.

263
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,870
No, sir.

264
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,680
Lookouts aloft, Mr Learmouth?  

265
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,790
They've been up for half an hour.

266
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,550
-And the horizon?
-Horizon!

267
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,390
-Horizon clear!
-Horizon clear!

268
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,630
Thank you, Mr Learmouth. Let's put an end to this.

269
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,260
Mr Seward, I want all hands to quarters within the hour.

270
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,870
Mr Learmouth, set a new course, please, south-southwest.

271
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,390
If there are any complaints about the delay,

272
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,550
the men can take the matter up with Mr Harrison.

273
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,030
-Sir...
-Lieutenant?

274
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,350
Just that cloud over there.

275
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,430
You don't think it could be...?

276
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,470
Give me your glass.

277
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,710
Land ho!

278
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,710
Land ho!

279
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,030
Mr Harrison, it seems I owe you an apology.

280
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,350
And may I put my marker down here and now

281
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,300
for the first watch that your father makes to go on sale to the public?

282
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,990
Can you manage all right? If you put it on the back seat, I think it will be good.

283
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,030
Rupert!

284
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,190
I think you'd better take this as well.

285
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,950
H4. Thank you very much.

286
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,990
I'm sorry if we appeared to act a little hastily.

287
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,030
Anyway, I'm very pleased.

288
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,260
I feel like Jack and the Beanstalk, 

289
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,110
stealing the treasure from the giant's castle.

290
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,790
-What?
-Nothing.

291
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,910
-Nice motorcar!
-Not mine, I'm afraid.

292
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,090
Borrowed it from a chum in the RAF. 

293
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:14,750
I can't afford one.

294
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,030
-Of course.
-Are you all right? Thank you so much.

295
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,990
Look, if there are any expenses involved, tools or whatever,

296
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,110
make a note of them and send them to me.

297
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,150
Thank you so much.

298
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,710
News of your achievement is all over town,

299
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:47,110
as is the fact that you are about to win 20,000 pounds.

300
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,230
You're going to be a very popular young man, Mr Harrison.

301
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,270
-I envy you.
-Thank you.

302
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,350
But I have to get back to London before I can be sure.

303
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,630
Mr Harrison...

304
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,470
You are clearly not aware that while you were at sea,

305
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,510
war was declared with Spain.

306
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,450
Frankly, 

307
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:11,030
I'm surprised the admiralty permitted you to travel to Jamaica at all.

308
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,510
They must have known that you were likely to be stranded here.

309
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,950
Well, there has to be a ship going back to England.

310
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,230
No. I'm afraid not.

311
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,550
Besides, it would be too dangerous to travel unescorted.

312
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,670
I'm sure you wouldn't wish your watch to be captured by the Spanish.

313
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,790
Enjoy yourself.

314
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,070
This is a very beautiful island.

315
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,310
-Where are you going to put it?
-In the attic.

316
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,110
And the job?

317
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,950
What?

318
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,470
You said you were going to London about a job.

319
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,430
Oh, yes, I did.

320
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,080
-I met Uncle Mac.
-Uncle Mac?

321
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,110
You don't have an Uncle Mac!

322
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,190
I do now. He offered me a job on the wireless.

323
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,110
You're not going to play records, are you?

324
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,150
Not quite.

325
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,150
Do you speak English?

326
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,990
She wants to know which of you is the rich bastard.

327
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,470
My dear girl, I'm the rich bastard.

328
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,430
Perhaps you would allow me the honour of the next dance.

329
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,270
Look over there.

330
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,430
-Who are they?
-They're from the Merlin.

331
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,750
Arrived this afternoon to offload some prisoners and claim their bounty.

332
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,720
The ship's a hulk, two masts sprung, 

333
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,910
and half the rigging gone.

334
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,390
They were on their way to England when they came across a privateer.

335
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,230
Lucky bastards.

336
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,270
What's the name of the captain?

337
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,310
Irish fellow. Bourke.

338
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,950
William Bourke

339
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,550
Let's see... two,

340
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,870
four, six,

341
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,910
8 10 12\Neight, ten, twelve.

342
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,270
So, that's three officers and twelve men,

343
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:45,390
Harrison, we'll take you with us as long as you're ready to leave tomorrow.

344
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,550
Tomorrow?

345
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,590
We sail on the noontide.

346
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,070
-Mr Sayer!
-Sir?

347
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,670
-I need you finished up there within the hour.
-We'll be ready.

348
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,910
I'll have to check to establish the longitude of the island.

349
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,950
Can't you wait another day?

350
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,030
My orders say I must make sail as soon as I'm seaworthy.

351
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,230
So... you'd better get on with it, then.

352
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,950
-How is it?
-Almost there.

353
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,950
What time do you make it?

354
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,310
-Well, the watch says...
-Not the watch.

355
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,430
I don't need the time back in England.

356
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,470
The Merlin leaves on the noontide.

357
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,310
-How long have I got?
-About an hour, I should say.

358
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,190
I'll do the calculations later. 

359
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:44,750
I don't want to be stranded here for four months.

360
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,150
Maskelyne may be on his way back from St Helena with his lunar results.

361
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,190
Come on. Give us a hand.

362
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,500
William, one of these chaps says he's a fisherman.

363
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,300
He's got a boat moored on the beach below. 

364
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,300
He could take you out. It would save time.

365
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,070
-Are you sure?
-I don't think you have an option.

366
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,110
-The Merlin won't wait for you.
-Well, come on, then!

367
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,270
-Good luck!
-Thank you!

368
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,390
Mr Harrison, I can see you live dangerously.

369
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,630
-I like that. Welcome aboard.
-Thank you, Captain.

370
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,470
I can see I'm not the only one.

371
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,230
-Set the upper topsails, Mr Parker.
-Aye, Captain.

372
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,830
-Set the upper topsails!
-Set the upper topsails!

373
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,270
Have done with your sums, Mr Harrison. Go up on deck.

374
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,110
It's a fine sight.

375
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,760
I cannot be certain till we are back in England,

376
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,790
but, according to my workings,

377
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,830
if we take the rate into account,

378
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,720
we've lost under a minute 

379
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,670
since the watch left London ten weeks ago.

380
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,710
The er... rate?

381
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,480
Well, we know the watch loses 211/22 seconds a day.

382
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,800
We call that the going rate. 

383
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,430
I used that in my calculations for Madeira.

384
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,930
Taking that into account, 

385
00:27:56,930 --> 00:28:00,550
there's a possible error in longitude of less than half a degree.

386
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,990
Let me be the first to congratulate you.

387
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,830
No, thank you.

388
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,710
I'm already drunk.

389
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,630
All my life... my father's life,

390
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,670
has been for this moment.

391
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,550
Listen.

392
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,830
If the watch stops now, sir,

393
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,990
so does my heart,

394
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,540
for there will be no proof of its achievement.

395
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,990
Half a degree.

396
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,230
We've won the prize, Captain.

397
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,270
We've won the prize!

398
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,790
Captain, Spaniard about a cannon shot away.

399
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,520
Every man to his station! 

400
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,830
Tell the master gunner to report to me on deck.

401
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,830
Aft, loosen your guns! Get those portholes open!

402
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,750
I don't know what she's waiting for.

403
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,860
-Stand the guns by. -Aye, Captain.

404
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,950
Steady!

405
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,230
-Fire as she comes by!
-Fire as she comes by!

406
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,190
The dial is of white enamel with an ornamental design in black.

407
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,570
The hour and minute hands are of blued steel, 

408
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,630
and there is a polished centre second hand.

409
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:45,750
The movement can be swung out of the case, turning on a bolt and joint,

410
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,870
exactly as do those of ordinary watches of the period.

411
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,430
It's no good. We're going to have to try and outrun her.

412
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,470
Mr Markland,

413
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,790
put on all the sail she can carry and set a course due east.

414
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,030
Aye aye, Captain.

415
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,110
Can we get any more men aloft, Mr Bandelwine?

416
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,150
We're taking on water forward.

417
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,690
We've got to keep the pumps manned, sir.

418
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,740
I want eight men at the pumps at all times, changing every quarter.

419
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,750
-Mr Hallam, I'm holding you responsible.
-Yes, sir.

420
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:45,260
The pallet radius and crown wheel are both very small compared with the balance,

421
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,270
but, not content with this,

422
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,430
Harrison fitted, between the fourth and crown wheels,

423
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,690
a most ingenious remontoir,

424
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:58,190
whose action, at first sight, is almost uncanny.

425
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,640
Right, lads, over she goes!

426
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,340
Steady up now. Take it up. Take it up there.

427
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,430
Boatswain?

428
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,850
If we get it on top of the hole, 

429
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:28,080
the suction should hold it.

430
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,750
We'll have to keep the pumps going day and night, sir.

431
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,790
The mist is starting to lift.

432
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,370
Quick as you can, Boatswain.  

433
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:37,110
You heard the captain. Steady now.

434
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,150
Haul away! Come on, now!

435
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,150
The watch beats five to a second,

436
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,870
a slight recoil being perceptible at each beat,

437
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,310
and goes for 30 hours.

438
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,270
The plates are of brass, polished, but not gilt.

439
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,990
The pivot holes are jewelled as far as the third wheel,

440
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,150
that is to say, those of the balance, staff, detent,

441
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,150
contrate wheel, fly, fifth, fourth and third wheels.

442
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,190
The jewels are rubies,

443
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,230
and the end stones, diamonds.

444
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,270
It is a masterpiece,

445
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,550
weighing only slightly less than the brain that conceived it.

446
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,310
Harrison.

447
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,430
Morning, Captain.

448
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,310
How is your watch?

449
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,150
Dry, sir, I think.

450
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,540
It must be the only thing on board the ship that is.

451
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,670
Who will believe in a naval watch that cannot survive a storm?

452
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,830
There's many a ship that doesn't survive a storm, Mr Harrison,

453
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,870
but the navy don't stop making them.

454
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,830
It's not the navy I have to convince, sir. It is the Board of Longitude.

455
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,830
I'm very sorry, Reverend, to hear that your journey to St Helena was unsuccessful.

456
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,230
Unsuccessful, sir? I think you've been misinformed.

457
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:01,470
1,000 miles to observe the planet Venus, and it turns out to be a cloudy day.

458
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,510
Am I misinformed?

459
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,550
The transit of Venus was but one part of my expedition.

460
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,270
My lunar observations on board were most interesting,

461
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,310
as I shall explain to the Board.

462
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,750
Mr Harrison.

463
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,590
-Mr William Harrison.
-We'll go together.

464
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,750
My instructions are quite clear, sir.

465
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,030
Don't worry, they can't hurt us. We've won.

466
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:48,030
Mr Harrison, is this your idea of a scientific observation?

467
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,690
I must apologise, sir, 

468
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:51,890
but the journey back was very difficult, 

469
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,570
and the papers were damaged.

470
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,070
I am referring to the fact that 

471
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:57,870
it appears only one observation was taken in Jamaica.

472
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,510
No, no. Two, sir.

473
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,140
But the second, it appears, was taken from another position.

474
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,770
I had very little time, sir, 

475
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:06,020
but I can assure you 

476
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:08,260
the observation was most carefully taken,

477
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,310
with witnesses present, as instructed by the Board.

478
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:18,030
Mr Harrison, do you have any formal astronomical training?

479
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,260
No, sir, 

480
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:22,990
but I have been taking observations for my father since I was six years old.

481
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,190
Really?

482
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,190
Mr John Harrison.

483
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,750
My lords, gentlemen, if I may beg your indulgence,

484
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:03,000
it is 25 years since I first had the honour 

485
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,830
to address this Board

486
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,310
under the chairmanship of Dr Edmund Halley,

487
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:12,200
and since that time I worked with only one ambition to

488
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:16,790
to satisfy your requirements, as laid down by act of parliament 

489
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,950
for the discovery of longitude at sea.

490
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,790
It is with both great pride and honour

491
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,740
and humility that I stand here today with my son

492
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,790
after his great trial.

493
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,830
Thank you, Mr Harrison.

494
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,870
-May I?
-Thank you.

495
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,580
I have asked you here to inform you of the resolution of the Board,

496
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:45,700
that firstly, the brief calculations of Mr William Harrison are to be sent for computation

497
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:51,150
and the instruments used in those observations are also to be sent for examination.

498
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,310
The Board will then consider these reports at a further meeting,

499
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,750
the date of which will be announced in due course.

500
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,950
That will be all for now, gentlemen.

501
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,150
Sir, I am an old man,

502
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,590
and an old man can sometimes find his senses unexpectedly weakened.

503
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:25,590
There is, perhaps, an element of your argument that I have misunderstood,

504
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,630
or even misheard.

505
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,590
My watch...

506
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:38,150
Lost one minute, 53 and half seconds after 81 days at sea,

507
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,870
as witnesses signed in the papers you have before you,

508
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,390
which you seem so keen to put away.

509
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:50,310
I have fulfilled the terms most exactly, as laid down in the Act of Queen Anne,

510
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,470
and I demand that you consider the question of my reward.

511
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,160
Mr Harrison, 

512
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:04,790
I am not a commissioner of the gaming board here to settle some bet.

513
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,510
I am a scientist, bent on investigation of a most serious subject.

514
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:15,190
Now, the Board are, at present, unsatisfied with the information before them,

515
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:20,550
but have decided to make further investigation with the help of some expert advice.

516
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:26,270
Now, you will be summoned in due course to hear the results of that investigation.

517
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,550
Thank you.

518
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,830
-They're disputing the observations.
- On what grounds?

519
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,190
Too few, taken from different positions.

520
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,740
It is no more necessary to make multiple observations

521
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:43,380
}than it is to look at one's watch 100 times to tell the time.

522
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,830
I'll go to Greenwich and start a programme of experiments to prove that.

523
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,870
We shall fight them.

524
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,390
They're interested only in observations, not in the timekeeping of the clock.

525
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,950
Because they are astronomers. It's all they understand.

526
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,270
Rupert Gould, 10.30.

527
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,310
- Programme?
- Children's Hour.

528
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,430
You've got 7 and half minutes, which is about 1,500 words.

529
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,710
- How long is your script?
- I don't have a script.

530
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,750
But you have to have a script.

531
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,470
I have a watch. Don't worry, it'll be 7 and half minutes.

532
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,420
Well, don't forget, at the end, say, "Goodbye, everyone,"

533
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,670
count to three, one, two, three, then say goodbye.

534
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,110
-Why the pause?
- So the children can say goodbye back to you.

535
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,390
I want you to close your eyes

536
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,020
and try to think a thought that nobody else has ever thought before.

537
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,070
Think very hard.

538
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,590
Pay no attention to anybody else around you.

539
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:53,700
what you see, is it just darkness?

540
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,670
Or is there a picture?

541
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,510
Most of us, with our eyes closed, just see the dark,

542
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:03,900
but the artist or the scientist can sometimes see something new,

543
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,870
something never thought of before.

544
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,190
It's these ideas that can change our lives,

545
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,320
and the people who think of them,

546
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:15,230
whether they are musicians, painters, architects or engineers,

547
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,620
are called inventors.

548
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,710
Some of you listening now are inventors.

549
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:25,270
Open your eyes. Look around. Can you tell who it'll be?

550
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,860
-Will it be somebody with untidy hair?
- Very good.

551
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,910
I doubt it.

552
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,150
But new inventions often seem strange at first,

553
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,190
even frightening.

554
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,280
Something that seems normal to us, 

555
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,150
the clock ticking on the mantelpiece,

556
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:42,510
would have seemed like a magician's trick a few hundred years ago.

557
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,100
Mr Harrison, 

558
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:48,910
we have asked you here to acquaint you with the resolutions of the Board.

559
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,350
We find that the Jamaica trial recently undertaken was not sufficient

560
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:01,270
to determine the longitude at sea laid down by act of parliament.

561
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,990
Sir, I beg to differ.

562
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:07,270
Please, let me finish, Mr Harrison.

563
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:11,990
The Board therefore wishes to instigate a further trial,

564
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,110
with Mr Harrison or some suitable individual,

565
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:19,430
accompanied by an astronomer approved by the Board

566
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,470
to witness the observations.

567
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,840
Gentlemen, at our last meeting

568
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,750
you questioned the observations taken by myself in Jamaica.

569
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:37,140
Since then, I have compiled an extensive report prepared at Greenwich.

570
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,190
Please don't exert yourself, Mr Harrison.

571
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,150
The Board has withdrawn the objections to your observations.

572
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,870
Then why did we fail?

573
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,380
One trial of the watch proves nothing.

574
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,070
The results may have been chance alone,

575
00:40:54,160 --> 00:41:00,390
and, besides, the Board is not satisfied that the true longitude of Jamaica is known,

576
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,100
and feels, therefore, that a proper evaluation is impossible.

577
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,150
But you knew that all along.

578
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,590
May I see the results of these computes?

579
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,350
I don't think so, do you?

580
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,390
No, I'm afraid not.

581
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,220
I mean that would require their individual permissions,

582
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,750
and we don't have that at the moment.

583
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,150
Now, I must ask you, Mr Harrison, 

584
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:32,190
whether you will accept the resolution of this Board

585
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:36,060
for a further trial accompanied by an official astronomer?

586
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,690
A maritime museum's a marvellous idea.

587
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,510
And the perfect place for Harrison's masterpieces.

588
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,700
We've already written to the Science Museum 

589
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:48,100
to tell them that we want them back.

590
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,150
They were not pleased, I can tell you.

591
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,670
In fact, I've applied for one of the curatorships.

592
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,710
Yes, I know.

593
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,750
I wanted to talk to you about that.

594
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,630
Have they considered my application?

595
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,790
I'm afraid your application was not officially put before the committee.

596
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,230
-Why?
-Well...

597
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,180
I'm not the one that decides these things, 

598
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:13,790
but after all that nonsense in the newspapers,

599
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:17,310
it was not felt... appropriate.

600
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,350
That's it, keep her level.

601
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,390
Steady as she goes.

602
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,430
Very good. Excellent.

603
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,080
Keep coming. There. Yes.

604
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,590
Thank you.

605
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,630
Thank you so much.

606
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,350
Oh, I'm so sorry.

607
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,390
Of course.

608
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,400
Ah, good morning. 

609
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,710
Christopher Irwin and the marine chair.

610
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,750
Oh, good morning to you, sir.

611
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,930
Mr John Jefferies at your service, 

612
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:58,710
and may I present Mr John Harrison?

613
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,430
The clockmaker? I'm very honoured to meet you.

614
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:06,830
I take it this machine is intended for the taking of lunar observations.

615
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:11,870
Yes, impervious to the weather... And the waves.

616
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,610
It's er... It's my own invention.

617
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,070
John!

618
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,230
It's... Up we go.

619
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,750
It's simple, yet...

620
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,030
.. effective,

621
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:31,980
and will completely solve the problem of the longitude.

622
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,800
I've made two, 

623
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,100
ready to sail to Barbados with Reverend Maskelyne.

624
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,870
-Maskelyne?
-Yes.

625
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:43,590
They said I should be here at midday. Mr Bliss was most particular.

626
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,630
Mr Harrison.

627
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,870
Oh, I can manage, Jefferies.

628
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,630
Mr Irwin.

629
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,830
My lords, this is prevarication.

630
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:58,350
If no astronomer is appointed, then the matter must be postponed.

631
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,870
I humbly beg your indulgence...

632
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,150
Sir, we're aware that you have made various unsuccessful applications,

633
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,500
and, not surprisingly, 

634
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:10,590
no reputable man has agreed to waste his time on such an expedition.

635
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,330
We should therefore move on to other matters.

636
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,110
-Ah.
-My lord...

637
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,940
I must apologise for my late arrival.

638
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,990
Mr Harrison, we are discussing the matter of an astronomer

639
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,150
to accompany the trial of your father's watch.

640
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,390
My lord, I have a proposal.

641
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:44,510
-Mr Greene near Greenwich has...
-We have already covered this.

642
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,800
We did write to Mr Greene, 

643
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:49,070
but sadly, I spoke to him yesterday, and he must decline.

644
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:52,390
His recent duties at the observatory are extremely demanding.

645
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,600
I can confirm this, my lord. I was there, 

646
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,100
and Mr Greene was adamant.

647
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:59,060
My lord, I've just come from Greenwich, 

648
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:01,220
where I had the good fortune to speak to Mr Greene.

649
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,100
I trust, Mr Harrison, 

650
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:06,830
it's not your intention to question the word of two members of this Board.

651
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:11,030
No, my lord, but Mr Greene has kindly agreed to accompany me here.

652
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,990
No, I certainly have never seen anything like it.

653
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,590
Most extraordinary.

654
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,110
It stays completely upright in any weather.

655
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,550
-I see.
-Mr Greene?

656
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,910
- What are you doing here?
- I am not sure, Reverend.

657
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,670
It has been a most confusing morning.

658
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,710
Christopher Irwin. The marine chair.

659
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,360
-Mr Greene.
-Excuse me.

660
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:42,070
You wouldn't, by any chance, be the Reverend Maskelyne?

661
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,590
-What?
-My name is Christopher Irwin, and this is...

662
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,990
-The marine chair. Yes, I think I'd gathered that.
-Right.

663
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:54,510
So, in principle, Mr Greene, you would be prepared to accompany the expedition?

664
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,550
Yes, but...

665
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:58,100
But what you are saying, I think, 

666
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:01,660
is that you would require permission from your superior.

667
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,950
Correct me if I'm wrong.

668
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:09,470
Well, perhaps my colleagues and I could help you in that.

669
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:15,580
Dr Bliss, who, exactly, is Mr Greene's superior?

670
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,110
You know perfectly well he works for me at the observatory.

671
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:21,070
If you were to remove your objection, the matter may be settled.

672
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:25,510
My lord, I believe the Reverend Nevile Maskelyne would be a more suitable observer.

673
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:30,070
His presence on the trial would allow us to test the lunar data he is compiling.

674
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,430
I have here a copy of his new publication, The British Mariner's Guide.

675
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:39,310
It contains an entry for the position of the moon at every day of every hour for the next three years.

676
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:43,010
It enables, with observation, the calculation, 

677
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:44,150
at sea, of the longitude.

678
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:48,070
Very well, my lord, I propose that both Mr Greene and Mr Maskelyne go.

679
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,110
Can we all agree on that?

680
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:53,030
Then the matter is settled.

681
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:56,550
I think there may be one or two other points to clarify.

682
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:10,670
We would like to see six equal-altitude observations per day for three consecutive days.

683
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:11,310
Impossible. 

684
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:13,800
You cannot get six observation a day at Greenwich, 

685
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:14,990
let alone the West Indies.

686
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,430
-Captain Campbell?
-He's right, my lord.

687
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,670
Let it read, "as many as are practical". 

688
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:22,690
Very well, for as many as are practical.

689
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,990
Keep him level.

690
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:34,910
The watch must be submitted to me at the observatory for testing

691
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,310
to determine its rate before the second trial.

692
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:42,230
I'm not letting the watch out of my sight.

693
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,880
We need to determine the rate.

694
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,790
Captain Campbell, enlighten us.

695
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:53,350
My lord, I think the rate should be determined by whoever is closest to the instrument,

696
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,950
which must be Harrison.

697
00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:01,270
If it is disclosed before the voyage starts, there is no possibility of dissimilation.

698
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:07,760
We believe the Reverend Maskelyne 

699
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,070
should travel on a different ship than the Harrisons'

700
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:15,580
so that he may have more time to set up his instruments for the observation of Jupiter's moons.

701
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,630
Agreed.

702
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:20,910
Agreed.

703
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:30,390
The Reverend Maskelyne will be in Barbados one month before you,

704
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,040
and will have everything prepared for your arrival.

705
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:37,870
It remains for us to wish you every success aboard His Majesty's ship Tartar.

706
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,910
Hear! Hear!

707
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,790
Mr Harrison.

708
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,830
Here's to a successful voyage.

709
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,710
-Well?
-I'd like to take another observation.

710
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,750
-Just to be sure.
- Indeed.

711
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,190
-Captain Lindsay.
-Certainly.

712
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:46,940
Mr Irwin, you're just in time to witness our observation.

713
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,550
We were expecting you to meet us.  

714
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:50,580
No-one told us that you had arrived.

715
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:55,350
The transmission of information is not a strong point among the inhabitants of this island.

716
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:56,630
How was the voyage? 

717
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:58,670
Very satisfying. Where is Maskelyne?

718
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:00,710
The man's an idiot.

719
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,750
-Could you hold this a moment?
-Er... yes, of course.

720
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:06,230
He has no understanding of my chair.

721
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,910
Simply because a hinge broke on the second day out,

722
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,070
causing him some very minor inconvenience, he's refused to use it.

723
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,870
What sort of a scientist does that make him?

724
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,910
23 degrees of elevation.

725
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,590
And the watch at... 3.57.

726
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:28,910
That gives us a longitude of 59 degrees, 0 minutes and 30 seconds.

727
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:33,710
Captain Lindsay, would you be kind enough to give me your signature, sir?

728
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:37,230
-Is that it?
-What do you mean?

729
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,990
-Is that all you do?
-Sorry to disappoint you, Mr Irwin.

730
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,030
What did you expect?

731
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:45,110
-Mr Greene, would you care to witness?
- Of course, Mr Harrison.

732
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:49,150
Well, the Reverend Maskelyne spends half the day calculating his sums,

733
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,700
and with a good deal of bad temper besides.

734
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:57,070
I have, once or twice, offered to help, being something of a mathematician myself,

735
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:59,510
and have been most rudely addressed by him.

736
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,550
That's lunatics for you.

737
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,110
You'll find him very confident.

738
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,760
-Of what?
-That the longitude solution is found.

739
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:12,870
He was very annoyed that it was not recognised after the voyage to St Helena,

740
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,910
but he's convinced it is his now.

741
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,240
He's told half the island, as a result of which,

742
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:22,870
he's followed everywhere by the three unwed ladies of the town and their mothers,

743
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,910
who are convinced he is to be rich.

744
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,950
He doesn't seem to notice, though.

745
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:30,030
I don't think he's very... interested.

746
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,820
Oh, it is a hard life, I admit, 

747
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:44,110
but I find myself enjoying it.

748
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:47,430
No, there's no more training required whatsoever.

749
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,340
I mean, anyone who's sat down before can use it. 

750
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:51,470
Well, almost everyone.

751
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,830
Thank you.

752
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,670
I'd expected to see the Reverend Maskelyne here.

753
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,140
He sends his apologies. Thank you.

754
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:05,510
He's at his observatory. It's out there in the hills, outside the town.

755
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:08,550
He's expecting to see you tomorrow morning.

756
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:14,270
-You must be proud to be part of his expedition.
-I beg your pardon?

757
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:19,110
Madam, Mr Harrison intends to challenge the reverend gentleman, not to support him.

758
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:22,920
He is his competitor.

759
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,630
Oh, dear. How silly of me.

760
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,600
Congratulation on the safe trip

761
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,230
Welcome to this island paradise.

762
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:54,070
Good morning.

763
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,790
I was sorry to miss you at dinner last night.

764
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:01,550
Those things become predictable after a while. It was such a perfect night.

765
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:04,590
-I understand you are to be congratulated.
-Really?

766
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:08,150
Everyone at dinner informed me you'd won the longitude prize.

767
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:12,100
You should not take talk like that seriously.

768
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:16,670
I wouldn't, were it not for the fact that the talk apparently came from you, Reverend.

769
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:20,460
Under the circumstance, I think it would be improper that you take the equal altitude observations

770
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:23,020
that will determine the accuracy of my watch.

771
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,010
I would prefer them to be taken by Mr Greene 

772
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:26,790
and witnessed by Captain Lindsay.

773
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,950
How dare you say that to me, sir?

774
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,900
I am a scientist.

775
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:33,190
Oh, dear boy, I don't think he meant... 

776
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:34,290
Shut up, you stupid man!

777
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:39,130
Gentlemen, could I suggest a compromise?

778
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:56,770
Damn and blast this bloody contraption!

779
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:59,890
It's impossible to take a measurement under these circumstances.

780
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:05,000
28 degrees and 15 minutes.

781
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:08,410
28 degrees and 15 minutes.

782
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:12,650
-28 degrees, 15 minutes.
- Would you be quiet?

783
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:15,970
I'm so sorry to have disturbed you. We are quite finished.

784
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:20,490
Look, old man, why don't you make another observation tomorrow?

785
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:23,970
I'm sure the conditions will be better.

786
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:29,050
Get out of my way!

787
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:44,850
William...

788
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:48,370
I thought we'd lost you.

789
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:50,970
I think perhaps you have.

790
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:58,100
You know, today is the first day I can remember when I haven't looked at a clock or a watch,

791
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:01,290
or even done a calculation.

792
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:10,210
I didn't know what to do at first. I had just started to walk.

793
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:13,930
-What is it?
-Bad news, I'm afraid.

794
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:17,130
I've found you a ship.

795
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:20,890
She's a merchantman. Captain's name is Robert Manly.

796
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:22,930
He seems a good fellow,

797
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:26,350
and er... she sails at noon tomorrow.

798
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,250
What will you do?

799
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:07,970
Sell the house, I suppose. No choice about that.

800
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:12,050
-I can't afford to keep it.
-Well, where will you live?

801
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:15,650
Oh, I'll find somewhere, a small hotel.

802
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:20,650
What about the clocks? I don't suppose a hotel would put up with them.

803
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:23,410
There's only one left, you'll be pleased to hear.

804
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,450
It's proving to be a bit tricky.

805
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:28,810
I'm sending it back to Greenwich. I'll finish working on it there.

806
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:31,410
Oh, yes. Cecil said you'd applied for a job as a curator.

807
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:34,770
No, no, I er... I changed my mind about that.

808
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:41,010
Well, goodbye, then.

809
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:43,050
Goodbye.

810
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:47,050
Laura says there's going to be war.

811
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:49,090
-What do you think?
-I don't think so.

812
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,350
It's all phooey.

813
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:59,470
Thank you so much for coming.

814
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:12,070
-How is he?
-Very weak.

815
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:16,790
He's angry he could not be there to greet you. He received your letters.

816
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,830
How long has he been like this?

817
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:20,870
Since you left.

818
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,820
Try not to get him excited.

819
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,160
The fever is strong. I have bled him, 

820
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,750
but he's very weak, and I dare do no more.

821
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:31,990
-I'll come back tomorrow.
-Thank you.

822
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,910
When I was just a baby,

823
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:49,390
I remember lying in bed very sick,

824
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:56,190
and my mother holding a watch in front of my face while she sang to me.

825
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:01,190
I don't remember the song,

826
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:06,470
but the ticking of the watch seemed like an orchestra playing with her,

827
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:11,580
and then she... she laid the watch on my pillow.

828
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:17,390
Afterwards, she used to say it sent me to sleep.

829
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,590
But it didn't.

830
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:24,070
People say the tick of a clock

831
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,110
is like a single sound,

832
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,390
but it's hundreds.

833
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:35,990
It's hundreds of tiny frictions, expansions and contractions,

834
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:39,390
all twisted into a single moment.

835
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:47,670
I'm very sorry I wasn't there to meet you.

836
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,470
Don't mind about that. We did it.

837
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,780
Mr Greene was there and witnessed everything.

838
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:56,990
Even Maskelyne can't deny it.

839
00:58:57,080 --> 00:59:00,070
This time they can't refuse us.

840
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,820
I'd like to see their faces when you tell them.

841
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:16,070
He looks pleased with himself.

842
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,750
Still, there is one piece of news.

843
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:26,670
The Very Reverend John Bliss fell off his horse whilst taking exercise in the park.

844
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,110
He did not recover.

845
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,270
It's devastating, isn't it?

846
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,550
Who is to be Astronomer Royal?

847
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:47,590
Not decided yet.

848
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,630
Mr William Harrison.

849
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:58,700
Mr Harrison, 

850
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:03,200
you may have heard of the sad death of the Astronomer Royal in your absence.

851
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:07,590
I'd like to take this opportunity to present the new Astronomer Royal.

852
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,310
Good morning, William.

853
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,350
The Reverend Nevile Maskelyne,

854
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:14,870
recently returned from a successful trip to the West Indies.

855
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:20,590
The members of the Board will be familiar, I think, with his report

856
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:23,200
and the astonishing success he had on his journey,

857
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:26,550
and the triumphant use of Professor Mayer's tables.

858
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:31,910
My lord, I'm sure I also must congratulate the Reverend Maskelyne, but as we all know,

859
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,190
the calculation with the watch may be completed in a matter of minutes,

860
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,230
and does not depend upon the weather.

861
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:38,750
Be quiet, Mr Harrison.

862
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:42,310
We are coming now to the matter of the watch and the opinion of the computers.

863
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,700
Captain Campbell. 

864
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:45,260
You attest this is your report 

865
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:47,550
and that you and your colleagues agree on it?

866
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:50,390
-We do.
-Very well.

867
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,430
Mr Harrison, please step forward.

868
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:58,310
It is the finding of this board that the watch or timepiece

869
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:02,230
created by John and William Harrison did keep correct time

870
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:06,830
within the greatest accuracy required by the Act of Queen Anne

871
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:09,830
as drawn up by parliament 51 years ago.

872
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,630
My lord, may I have a copy of those to show my father?

873
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:22,550
He has waited a long time to hear Your Lordship's kind words.

874
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:24,590
In good time, Mr Harrison.

875
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:29,700
Astronomer Royal, would you be kind enough to read the fifth paragraph of the Act?

876
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:34,510
"And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid

877
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:37,930
that as soon as such method for the discovery of the said longitude shall have been tried, 

878
01:01:37,930 --> 01:01:41,270
and found practicable and useful at sea... "

879
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:44,270
Thank you. "Practicable and useful. "

880
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:47,230
Those are the words I wish to draw to your attention.

881
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:52,000
We accept the usefulness of the watch, but is it practicable?

882
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:58,990
Mr Harrison has never permitted this committee to examine the workings of his timepiece.

883
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:03,150
I suggest to you that is because he himself has doubt

884
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:06,230
about the practical use of his invention.

885
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:11,390
My lords, you must understand that my father has sought to protect his work

886
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:13,750
from those who might steal his invention,

887
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:16,050
but if this Board requires it, 

888
01:02:16,050 --> 01:02:18,700
we shall submit detailed drawings of the workings of the watch

889
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,750
when he has received his prize.

890
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:22,100
Mr Harrison, 

891
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:25,590
this Board does not accept restrictions placed upon its work,

892
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:28,200
as prescribed by parliament.

893
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:33,230
Here are the conditions required for fulfilment of the terms of the Act.

894
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:38,580
First, your father must, in person, take the watch apart,

895
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:42,070
and explain the working of every detail

896
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:45,430
to the satisfaction of such persons as this Board shall appoint.

897
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:49,140
This shall include any experimental observations they may require.

898
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:53,830
Secondly, he shall make, or cause to be made under his sole direction,

899
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:57,070
two further watches of the same design

900
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:01,150
to demonstrate the practicality of their construction.

901
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:08,990
And, thirdly, these new watches shall be subjected to such test or tests as this Board shall require

902
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:13,790
to ascertain their usefulness under the terms of the Act.

903
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:18,550
Then, and only then, will he receive his prize.

904
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:24,670
My lord, my father is sick and he is 73 years old.

905
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:27,190
He has until Thursday to accept the conditions,

906
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:30,270
which, I must inform you, have been submitted to Parliament,

907
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:33,390
and will form part of a new amendment to this bill.

908
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:37,510
Call Mr Christopher Irwin, please.

909
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:04,110
-Are you all right, old man?
-Yes, thank you.

910
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:07,870
-What's Maskelyne doing here?
-He's the new Astronomer Royal.

911
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:11,270
Oh, turd.

912
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:42,030
-Is this everything, sir?
-Er... yes.

913
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:45,070
Thank you.

914
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:21,590
My lords, if I may beg your indulgence.

915
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:27,150
I'm not yet used to speaking. Let my son speak for me.

916
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:30,390
-Perhaps your father would like a chair.
-No, thank you.

917
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,830
-No, thank you.
-Let us proceed to the business.

918
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:34,870
Do you accept the terms of the Board?

919
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:40,150
My father accepts the need for disclosure of the working of his watch,

920
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:45,360
but wishes that he might demonstrate the mechanism to such as may understand it,

921
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,350
not to theorists.

922
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,390
That is for us to decide.

923
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:50,750
They can choose who they like. 

924
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:52,790
I'll choose who I let in my own house.

925
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:54,990
I beg pardon, Mr Harrison?

926
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:58,230
My father is pleased to accept the Board's nominations.

927
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:01,190
There is one question.

928
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:04,950
Your Lordship requires that we be prepared to do experimental observations.

929
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:07,110
My father is not clear what that means.

930
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:09,910
Well, it... it...

931
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:14,870
Reverend Maskelyne?

932
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:17,030
Um... there's nothing sinister about it,

933
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:20,150
merely that if there is a detail not understood by the committee,

934
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:23,550
such as how Mr Harrison is accustomed to... um...

935
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:25,590
What's the word?

936
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:30,310
.. temper a spring, for example, he should demonstrate his technique to us.

937
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:34,020
What does he understand about the tempering of a bloody spring?

938
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:37,990
Would it be possible to set out more explicitly what the Board requires

939
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:40,150
so that we might be prepared for it?

940
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,430
No, sir! It would not!

941
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:48,110
It is not your business, sir, to limit the enquiry of this Board

942
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:50,150
but to satisfy it.

943
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:54,630
It is not my business, sir, to explain the workings of a lifetime

944
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:58,190
to a group of dog-collared university book swallowers

945
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:03,400
who wouldn't know the difference between a balance spring and a bent hat pin!

946
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:07,630
For 30 years I've stood before this Board

947
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:10,910
I've never once had the occasion to talk to anyone

948
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,830
who knew anything about what I was actually doing,

949
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:16,830
any sense of the mechanisms I created,

950
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:22,420
but I carried on, trusting that if I fulfilled the Act of Queen Anne, 

951
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:24,190
I'd get my just rewards.

952
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:27,310
I have fulfilled that Act.

953
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:31,190
I have made such a mechanism.

954
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:35,270
Give me my prize and I'll use the money to build a factory,

955
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:37,730
make a hundred watches, a thousand, each one the same, 

956
01:07:37,730 --> 01:07:39,030
but I will not...

957
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:42,310
as long as I've got a drop of English blood in my body,

958
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:46,670
I'll not dance to the tune of a group of ignorant schoolboys.

959
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:53,790
Mr Harrison...

960
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,350
Mr Harrison!

961
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:06,070
Father...

962
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:09,830
Don't give me any more of your fine words and clever explanations.

963
01:08:09,830 --> 01:08:12,100
William, you know about what I've put up with

964
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:14,830
What do you understand about what I've done?

965
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:18,910
Could you build a watch, sir? No, you damn well couldn't.

966
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,950
Get away from me! Get away from me!

967
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:30,390
William...

968
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:33,510
William...

969
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:36,790
If you wouldn't mind...?

970
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:54,510
Mr Harrison, either your father signs an oath agreeing to these terms,

971
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:56,630
or this matter ends here.

972
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:59,050
We are prepared to pay half the award, 

973
01:08:59,050 --> 01:09:02,790
less those monies paid out, once we are satisfied with the disclosure,

974
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:03,870
and the other half 

975
01:09:03,870 --> 01:09:07,510
when the new watches made by your father have proved their worth.

976
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:12,600
My lord, if you would just change the wording of experimental observations, 

977
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:13,710
he would sign.

978
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:17,910
No! No! No! No! No!

979
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:24,470
How many times do I have to say it to you bloody people?

980
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:29,390
You do not negotiate with this Board!

981
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:06,830
I'm 40 years old,

982
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:11,350
and what family I have is here in this room.

983
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:19,950
These machines are my brothers and sisters.

984
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:23,180
Certainly, I know them better than any human.

985
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,270
So do you.

986
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:32,110
Ever since I were a child,

987
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:37,910
I've watched how carefully you touched them.

988
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:42,630
Never angry, always loving.

989
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:49,510
Nothing I could ever do could make your eyes light up

990
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:54,020
in the way an infinitesimal sliver of time

991
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,110
could sometimes make you weep with joy.

992
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:03,400
So I tried to slide myself between them and you,

993
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:08,600
hoping that some tiny drop of that feeling might fall on me.

994
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:14,630
As I grew older, I thought...

995
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:19,270
If I can understand them, perhaps you would begin to understand me,

996
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:23,310
until they became my life too.

997
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:28,510
And so, I find myself now,

998
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:35,350
knowing the touch of a brass wheel better than flesh and blood.

999
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,260
I will do as they wish.

1000
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:50,710
I wanted you to be safe.

1001
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:59,470
I thought I could make us impregnable.

1002
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:27,830
What's going on?

1003
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:31,270
We've been ordered to move all valuable exhibits out to Cambridge.

1004
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:34,790
Why on earth would Hitler bomb a museum in the middle of a park?

1005
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:36,950
-It's just orders.
-Oh, just orders.

1006
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:38,990
I've heard that...

1007
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:49,440
Do you mind if I do that? There's a special case for it.

1008
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:52,550
I made it myself some time ago, but I'm sure I can still find it.

1009
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:56,110
Help yourself. It's a funny-looking thing, isn't it? 

1010
01:12:56,110 --> 01:12:57,470
Yes, it is a funny-looking thing.

1011
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,270
Do you think I could have a chair?

1012
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:06,590
-Thank you.
-Look, er...

1013
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:11,830
Are you all right?

1014
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:15,430
No, I don't think I am.

1015
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:19,950
How old are you?

1016
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:23,350
18, although I don't know what that's got to do with it.

1017
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:27,990
Nothing. Nothing at all. Don't take any notice of me.

1018
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:31,430
It's just...

1019
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:34,270
Do you have any idea what it's like?

1020
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:37,670
War? Is that what you're worried about?

1021
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:40,470
It'll all be over before it begins.

1022
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:44,100
Germany don't want a war. It's just their way of waking us all up.

1023
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:47,960
Look, can I get you something?

1024
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:49,990
-A cup of tea?
-Yes.

1025
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,550
A cup of tea. That'll do the trick.

1026
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:23,550
I suggest they go to different destinations, 

1027
01:14:23,550 --> 01:14:26,110
then, if one is destroyed, the others will survive.

1028
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:28,230
-Is that possible?
-I'll do my best.

1029
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:31,910
At the moment, it's all I can do to get everything over to Cambridge.

1030
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,800
Oh, we are sending some of the smaller items to 

1031
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:36,230
a science museum vault in Beckenham.

1032
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:37,440
I could try and get one in there.

1033
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,270
Yes, Beckenham would be good.

1034
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:42,110
Well, leave it with me and I'll sort something out.

1035
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:44,150
Where are you going with that?

1036
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:58,830
Whoa! Watch where you're going!

1037
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:48,870
Muriel?

1038
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:50,910
Muriel!

1039
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:55,870
-Is that you?
-Rupert?

1040
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:00,990
I've just had...

1041
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,750
Rupert? Rupert, is that you?

1042
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:27,750
-Where's he gone?
-Down there.

1043
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:23,630
They're all satisfied.

1044
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:26,670
Now, if we just put the watch together and take it to the committee,

1045
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:28,750
they'll give us half the prize.

1046
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:30,790
What watch?

1047
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:32,830
There is no watch.

1048
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:36,270
Look at it.

1049
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:59,110
You know, the strange thing is I want to build another one.

1050
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:04,270
Taking it apart and putting it together again, I can see improvements.

1051
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:07,670
You have to make a duplicate. Those were the terms.

1052
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:09,710
Terms?

1053
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:13,750
What do they know? There wasn't one of them who understood what I was saying.

1054
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:16,300
Even the watchmakers didn't see everything.

1055
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:18,350
They think in straight lines,

1056
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:20,950
not prepared for the curve,

1057
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:24,390
the line of surprise that takes you to a place you cannot see.

1058
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:31,330
And how are we to know that 

1059
01:19:31,330 --> 01:19:34,470
this is the same watch that was used at the disclosure?

1060
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:37,060
If I could make a watch in five days, 

1061
01:19:37,060 --> 01:19:39,070
then I'd have the prize money by the end of the week.

1062
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:47,150
Very well. I am pleased to offer you the certificate of this Board.

1063
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:48,710
Congratulations.

1064
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:50,750
You've made something useful.

1065
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:55,820
How long will it take you to make two further watches, as required by the Act?

1066
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:59,790
-The new Act.
-I beg your pardon, sir?

1067
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:03,790
Additional instruments are not required by the Act of Queen Anne.

1068
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:06,870
The Act required that the invention be practical.

1069
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:11,080
We have merely clarified that issue in our recent amendment. 

1070
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:12,390
How long will it take?

1071
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:16,590
Two years, if my watch is returned to me to work on.

1072
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:19,670
I'm afraid that is impossible.

1073
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:22,350
Your watch, as you call it, is, of course, our watch.

1074
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:26,110
And this Board intends, under the direction of the Astronomer Royal,

1075
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:29,310
to conduct a series of tests, at the observatory in Greenwich,

1076
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:33,430
at the conclusion of which, Mr Larkin Kendall will make a copy of the watch

1077
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:36,270
and, I think you will agree, his need is the greater.

1078
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:40,110
It will take a further year if I'm forced to work without it.

1079
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:44,670
So be it, Mr Harrison. So be it.

1080
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:48,030
Thank you.

1081
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:54,670
Mr Harrison...

1082
01:20:55,880 --> 01:21:00,350
I have instructed the Astronomer Royal to collect the rest of the timepieces.

1083
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:04,190
Why?

1084
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:06,710
Because they are the property of this Board.

1085
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:26,950
He has brought an open cart with no suspension.

1086
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:29,990
He means to destroy them on the journey to Greenwich.

1087
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:37,030
-Good morning. I have come...
-I know why you're here.

1088
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:39,190
-Mr Harrison.
-Reverend Maskelyne.

1089
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:41,230
The machines are ready for collection.

1090
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:44,150
I will need a certificate from you that they're in good order.

1091
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:45,900
I'm not sure I'm a good judge of that, sir. 

1092
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:47,510
For once, I agree with you.

1093
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:50,160
I can state that they appear to be in good order.

1094
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:52,500
I can state as a fact they're in perfect order.  

1095
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:53,710
That will not be necessary.

1096
01:21:53,710 --> 01:21:55,900
I will need it to be understood that when they left my property,

1097
01:21:55,900 --> 01:21:57,200
that was the case, 

1098
01:21:57,200 --> 01:22:01,220
and that you are entirely responsible for their safety from this moment on.

1099
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:02,640
I accept that responsibility. 

1100
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:04,790
What is their normal method of transport?

1101
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:07,110
-Boat.
-Do not bandy words with me, sir.

1102
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:09,630
I am serious. They should go to Greenwich by barge,

1103
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:12,590
not some old cart like a butcher would carry a bag of bones in.

1104
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:14,300
I merely wish to know whether it is the custom 

1105
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:16,630
to take them to pieces before moving them.

1106
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:18,670
-No.
-But they must...

1107
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:22,710
Enough, enough! He has the authority of the Board. Let him exercise it.

1108
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:25,210
This is quite childish. 

1109
01:22:25,210 --> 01:22:27,150
I know perfectly well how to achieve this.

1110
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:34,150
This is the case. We will need a... a blacksmith to help us take it apart.

1111
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:45,550
One, two, three...

1112
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:29,550
Your father has been cruelly used,

1113
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:32,910
but while I'm out of the admiralty, there is little I can do.

1114
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:36,470
But there must be some other way.

1115
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,990
He cannot finish two further watches. It would kill him.

1116
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:44,030
Do you have any skill at cards, Mr Harrison?

1117
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:47,350
-No, my lord.
-No.

1118
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:49,710
Neither do these ladies, it would appear.

1119
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:52,230
Perhaps they flatter me.

1120
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:57,910
Well, parliament has already been the instrument of much mischief.

1121
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:01,620
There is, therefore, only one court of appeal I could recommend.

1122
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:04,150
-And that is?
-The Crown.

1123
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:28,270
-Could I have a look at that?
-A look at what?

1124
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:31,780
-Your watch.
-Sit up.

1125
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:41,230
Down you go.

1126
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:44,670
They took mine away.

1127
01:24:56,120 --> 01:24:58,070
Here you are.

1128
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:07,870
Mind you look after it, or you'll get me into trouble.

1129
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:11,990
Thank you.

1130
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:19,470
It will be quite informal. Just bow, and address him as Your Majesty.

1131
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:22,540
I will divert the Queen, 

1132
01:25:22,540 --> 01:25:26,070
whose taste is more inclined to scandal than to science.

1133
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:36,670
Oh. It's the enemy! It's the enemy!

1134
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:39,940
I see we are to meet the entire family.

1135
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:42,470
His Majesty is a most conscientious father.

1136
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:46,390
Shh... Quiet, everyone.

1137
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:50,580
.. with that one. Go on, pass it on.

1138
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:52,630
-Yes, sir.
-It's "Aye aye, sir"!

1139
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:54,670
Fire!

1140
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:59,510
Hold your fire, gentlemen. Hold your fire.

1141
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,070
My dears, we are saved. Lord Sandwich knows about the running of the ship.

1142
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:06,110
He will come to our rescue.

1143
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:09,070
Your Majesty, may I present Mr John Harrison?

1144
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:13,070
Mr Harrison. I am very pleased to make your acquaintance.

1145
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:15,720
Please, excuse our exuberance.

1146
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:18,310
Mr William Harrison.

1147
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:21,110
-Have you sailed on a frigate, sir?
-I have, Your Majesty.

1148
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:24,510
-And where, pray, were the mortars situated?
-On the fo'c's'le deck.

1149
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:28,220
Ah-ha! Georgie, you are in the right, sir, and I am in the wrong.

1150
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:30,990
Mr Harrison will show you the positioning of your mortars.

1151
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:33,030
You may need some more ammunition.

1152
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:39,070
My dear, you mustn't get the children so excited. They'll never sleep.

1153
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:49,430
Mr Harrison, I think I have something here that might interest you.

1154
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:52,190
Please excuse my husband.

1155
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:54,310
Come and look at our battleships, Mama.

1156
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:56,630
May I come aboard?

1157
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:00,240
This was presented to me by Mr Priestly,

1158
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:03,990
a most wonderful creation for the production of electricity.

1159
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:05,710
And what is its use?  

1160
01:27:05,710 --> 01:27:08,030
I haven't the foggiest, but dashed pretty, what?

1161
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:13,350
Mr Harrison, I have been informed at length about your trials,

1162
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:16,150
and I must tell you that we are very disturbed by the news.

1163
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:18,590
The safety of our ships is our dearest concern,

1164
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:21,470
and we are most grateful for your endeavours on their behalf.

1165
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:23,750
Thank you, Your Majesty.

1166
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:26,950
-Have you started work on the new watch?
-I have, sir.

1167
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:30,820
When it is finished, will you do something for me? Let me see it.

1168
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:32,790
I would be most interested.

1169
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:37,350
Oh, have you seen this? I wore it today, especially for you.

1170
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:41,550
-Mr Arnold made it for me. -Papa! Come and see our mortars!

1171
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:44,590
-We've blown up Lord Sandwich. -I hope not!

1172
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:47,030
The admiralty may want him back.

1173
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:57,470
So, do I get my watch back, then?

1174
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:04,870
I'm not sure I can do without it yet.

1175
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:16,790
Have you had a walk today?

1176
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:26,590
I'm getting you up. Do you have a name?

1177
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:31,070
Rupert.

1178
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:33,990
-Do you?
-Grace.

1179
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:38,070
But it's Nurse Ingrams to you.

1180
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:00,470
What do you think?

1181
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:05,190
It's good.

1182
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,470
Fit for a king?

1183
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:20,430
Rupert?

1184
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:27,190
Rupert...

1185
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:31,070
It's all right. I'm here.

1186
01:29:33,680 --> 01:29:36,140
Rupert, there's nothing to be alarmed about.

1187
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:38,190
It's only a drill.

1188
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:51,310
Feel the time.

1189
01:29:57,200 --> 01:29:58,830
I can feel your heart.

1190
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,950
That's better.

1191
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:06,270
Finish the story you were telling me yesterday,

1192
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:08,430
about him taking the watch to the King.

1193
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:12,230
Did he?

1194
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:17,830
Yes, he did.

1195
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:24,430
The King decided to do his own experiment,

1196
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:30,820
an experiment that lasted... months.

1197
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:33,670
Did it work?

1198
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:35,290
No, not at the beginning.

1199
01:30:35,290 --> 01:30:37,670
At the beginning, it was a disaster.

1200
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:39,910
It is a most perplexing matter.

1201
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,500
Dr Demainbray, my astronomer and dear friend, 

1202
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:44,200
came to me this morning with the news.

1203
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:46,200
Well, I can tell you, sir, that I did not believe it. 

1204
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:48,900
I came here to see for myself, and he was right.

1205
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:51,510
Absolutely and utterly correct, I don't know what to make of it.

1206
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:54,190
-I don't understand. What was wrong?
-Wrong? What?

1207
01:30:54,280 --> 01:30:57,270
-Was it slow? Did it stop?
-I would that it had, sir.

1208
01:30:57,360 --> 01:30:59,200
No, the problem is more serious than that.

1209
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:02,230
Your watch, sir, your watch, sir, is going backwards.

1210
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:15,350
I noticed it this morning, sir, and I immediately informed His Majesty.

1211
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:22,350
The er... The position, I believe, is correct.

1212
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:25,270
The position is fine.

1213
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:27,590
I have no explanation for this.

1214
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:29,950
-Wait.
-What?

1215
01:31:30,040 --> 01:31:33,430
-The compass needles. What do you think?
-The needles?

1216
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:36,710
When we were magnetising the needles, what did we do with the...?

1217
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:40,300
-Whatever do you call it?
-The lodestones.

1218
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:44,830
-Where's the key? The key...
-Quick, man, quick! Check your waistcoat.

1219
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:51,590
Ah...

1220
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:54,510
Lodestones.

1221
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:58,630
-You think the magnets affected the clock?
-I am sure of it, sir.

1222
01:31:58,720 --> 01:32:01,070
Take these out and throw them in the garden.

1223
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:04,910
Immediately.

1224
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:10,510
There.

1225
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:13,190
Now we must start all over again.

1226
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:15,950
-Your Majesty is very kind.
-Piffle, sir.

1227
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:18,110
I'm a scientist.

1228
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:24,110
That's it.

1229
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:29,140
That's right, watch the ball.

1230
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:35,990
55, 56, 57...

1231
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:37,790
58, 59...

1232
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:40,750
11 o'clock.

1233
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:46,710
Well, let me see, Mr Harrison.

1234
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:51,140
I think we are on target, gentlemen.

1235
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:57,510
Good. You're getting the hang of it now.

1236
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:00,590
Sneaky!

1237
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:45,430
January and February,

1238
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:48,510
March and April...

1239
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:50,550
June and July.

1240
01:33:56,240 --> 01:33:58,620
-They're going to kick you out soon.
-They can't.

1241
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:01,150
I'm feeling particularly mad at the moment.

1242
01:34:01,240 --> 01:34:04,500
I don't think they cure that kind of madness here.

1243
01:34:05,480 --> 01:34:08,100
-What will you do?
-I don't know.

1244
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,230
Pitch a tent outside the gates, I suppose.

1245
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:15,670
Do you have any objections to a life under canvas?

1246
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:17,710
Not more than a couple of thousand.

1247
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:21,430
Seriously, though...

1248
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:23,470
Seriously, though,

1249
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:26,510
I've no idea.

1250
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:29,590
It's just...

1251
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:33,000
You could move in with me.

1252
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:36,750
What, in the nurses' quarters?  Wouldn't Sister object?

1253
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:39,590
Or do you imagine I'll wear some sort of disguise?

1254
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:41,830
Don't be silly. It doesn't suit you.

1255
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:46,360
No, I'm... thinking about going home,

1256
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:49,590
before they throw me out too.

1257
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:54,670
My mother needs some help,  and I feel I ought to be with her.

1258
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:57,750
It's not ideal, I know, but...

1259
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:03,870
You could come too. If you wanted.

1260
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:07,070
It sounds pretty ideal to me.

1261
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:15,590
They've had hundreds of proofs. 

1262
01:35:15,590 --> 01:35:17,870
Why should one more change their minds?

1263
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:19,910
They must listen to the King,

1264
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,270
and there is one thing in our favour.

1265
01:35:22,360 --> 01:35:24,310
Lord Morton is deceased.

1266
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:31,750
I moved to enter the results of the recent trial at the King's observatory in Richmond,

1267
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,270
which show that in a trial of 70 days,

1268
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:41,190
greater than the time of the West Indies voyage stipulated in the Act of Queen Anne,

1269
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:45,270
the watch lost less than a tenth of a second a day,

1270
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:49,430
which would be consistent with finding a longitude in those West Indies

1271
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:53,670
to a distance of less than one mile, and, therefore, wholly within the Act.

1272
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:59,070
Sir, this Board...

1273
01:35:59,160 --> 01:36:01,910
This Board cannot accept an unsupervised trial,

1274
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,830
no matter how eminent the participants may have been.

1275
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:07,870
This Board is charged by a most solemn act of parliament,

1276
01:36:07,960 --> 01:36:09,990
as these members are here to witness,

1277
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:13,190
and must satisfy its observations, and not those of any other party.

1278
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:17,820
The royal trial was carried out under the strictest conditions,

1279
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:20,430
with three separate key holders,

1280
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:23,470
His Majesty graciously consenting to be one of them.

1281
01:36:23,560 --> 01:36:27,950
The regulating clock was the subject of nine observations of the sun

1282
01:36:28,040 --> 01:36:30,630
to keep a check on its accuracy,

1283
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:34,670
something the Astronomer Royal never attempted once during his own trial.

1284
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:36,710
Sit down, Mr Harrison!

1285
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:45,790
I would like to call upon Captain John Campbell,

1286
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:49,310
who has a report recently arrived from Jamaica,

1287
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:53,230
concerning the exploratory voyage of His Majesty's ship Resolution

1288
01:36:53,320 --> 01:36:57,510
under the command of Captain James Cook.

1289
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,550
Captain.

1290
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:04,550
Gentlemen, Captain Cook is carrying a copy of Mr Harrison's timekeeper,

1291
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:06,470
made by Mr Kendall, 

1292
01:37:06,470 --> 01:37:10,400
and the astronomical tables of the Reverend Maskelyne.

1293
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:14,390
His full report will not be available until his return,

1294
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:17,990
but I am able to read you this extract from his log.

1295
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:23,350
"It would not be doing justice to Mr Harrison and Mr Kendall

1296
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:27,470
if I did not own that we have received very great assistance

1297
01:37:27,560 --> 01:37:30,750
from this useful and valuable timepiece.

1298
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:38,750
The watch was used to predict the landfall of St Helena within three miles. "

1299
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:43,630
This is not evidence but anecdote!

1300
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:48,750
This Board, under the direction of the late Lord Morton,

1301
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:50,910
made its conditions perfectly clear.

1302
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,300
When Mr Harrison has completed his second copy,

1303
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:56,750
both watches will be subjected to a trial of several months,

1304
01:37:56,840 --> 01:37:59,300
on land and at sea, with the utmost rigour.

1305
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:01,350
No other test will suffice.

1306
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:05,060
If you will excuse me, I have an important matter I must attend to.

1307
01:38:05,160 --> 01:38:07,900
Mr Harrison, if your business is finished here, 

1308
01:38:07,900 --> 01:38:10,180
perhaps you would care to accompany me.

1309
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:21,550
With the Board's permission.

1310
01:38:28,240 --> 01:38:32,150
I want to thank the Board for giving me the opportunity

1311
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:34,800
to make a second copy of my watch.

1312
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:43,430
It is not often that the father is permitted to revisit the childhood of a much-loved child,

1313
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:47,390
as I have been allowed to,

1314
01:38:47,480 --> 01:38:49,430
and on that journey,

1315
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:56,710
find a new respect and love for that child.

1316
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:04,190
I...

1317
01:39:06,040 --> 01:39:08,390
If I can beg your indulgence, my lordships,

1318
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:10,430
I am an old man,

1319
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:13,570
and I've never been accounted a speaker of merit.

1320
01:39:15,160 --> 01:39:19,110
I may not be spared to complete another watch, but I've begun one.

1321
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:25,270
It will not, gentlemen, be a copy, because I am mindful of the Act of Queen Anne,

1322
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:29,670
to which I've clung for over 50 years,

1323
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:32,830
like a... like a shipwrecked sailor to a barrel.

1324
01:39:33,640 --> 01:39:35,590
To be practical.

1325
01:39:35,680 --> 01:39:39,270
In all my life, that's been my gospel and my creed.

1326
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:42,290
I have an idea that 

1327
01:39:42,290 --> 01:39:46,000
the heat compensation must be within the balance of the watch,

1328
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,830
and not around it,

1329
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:51,670
and, this morning, I made this.

1330
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:56,510
I tried the idea in my first sea clock

1331
01:39:56,600 --> 01:39:58,550
over 40 years ago.

1332
01:39:58,640 --> 01:40:01,990
I failed. I didn't understand it.

1333
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:05,150
So much I didn't understand.

1334
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:11,500
A compensating balance wheel will simplify the adjustment of the machine

1335
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:14,230
so others may make my watches more easily,

1336
01:40:16,440 --> 01:40:19,750
should God grant me the time to complete my labours.

1337
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:30,430
Thank God you're here. Hurry, please. The producer's having kittens.

1338
01:40:30,520 --> 01:40:32,980
But I thought the programme started at eight?

1339
01:40:33,080 --> 01:40:36,190
This is television, Commander. We have rehearsals.

1340
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:38,550
I'll have to take you straight to make-up.

1341
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:41,690
Oh, really, is all this absolutely necessary?

1342
01:40:43,240 --> 01:40:47,670
.. having constructed a timekeeper, from which discovery we have...

1343
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:51,750
John Harrison never received his award from the Board of Longitude.

1344
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:57,870
It came to him by special act of parliament when he was 80 years old.

1345
01:40:57,960 --> 01:41:03,150
.. to pay or cause to be paid to the said John Harrison,

1346
01:41:04,520 --> 01:41:10,230
that sum long promised to him by this house as a reward!

1347
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:12,310
Hear! Hear!

1348
01:41:14,300 --> 01:41:17,700
He had the furthur two years left to him to enjoy his wealth

1349
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:21,190
After his death in 1776,

1350
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:24,590
William married, but never made another watch.

1351
01:41:26,640 --> 01:41:30,670
After the War, Rupert Gould became a regular member of The Brains Trust,

1352
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:34,380
a popular panel show, and appeared several times on television.

1353
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:36,430
What makes a man great?

1354
01:41:36,520 --> 01:41:40,550
A man may be great in his aims or in his achievements or in both,

1355
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:45,750
but I think that man is truly great, who makes the world his debtor,

1356
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:48,910
who does something for the world which the world needs,

1357
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:53,190
and which nobody before him has done or known how to do.

1358
01:41:54,360 --> 01:41:56,310
John Harrison was such a man.

1359
01:41:56,400 --> 01:42:02,290
In 1946, Gould was finally made a curator of the National Maritime Museum,

1360
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:04,430
and a year later,

1361
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:07,590
he was awarded the gold medal of the British Horological Institute.

1362
01:42:08,280 --> 01:42:10,230
He died in 1948.

1363
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:13,190
And even today, there is not a seaman alive anywhere

1364
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:18,910
whose track is not made straighter, safer and more prosperous

1365
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:22,390
by the possession of a timekeeper.

1366
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:26,510
Gould's notebooks are displayed today at the Royal Observatory.

1367
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:30,670
Next to them stand John Harrison's four marine timepieces,

1368
01:42:30,760 --> 01:42:34,910
which, together represent one man's struggle against all odds

1369
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:38,110
to use the fourth dimension, time,
