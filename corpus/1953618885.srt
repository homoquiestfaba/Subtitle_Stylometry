1
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:37,555
Oh, sorry.
I don't speak French.

2
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:40,057
Oh, which one is your kid?

3
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,601
I don't have one.

4
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,812
I came to see
the merry-go-round.

5
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:50,443
Oh.

6
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:53,196
That's a mouthful.

7
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,781
Is-- is it okay?

8
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,783
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

9
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,167
I think you are the kid.

10
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:09,212
- Inside your heart, yeah?
- Yeah, maybe.

11
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:13,090
My guidebook says this is one
of the last ten cranked

12
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,842
merry-go-rounds in Europe.

13
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:17,261
You're kidding.
I'm in the book?

14
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:20,389
No, no, not you.
The merry-go-round.

15
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,436
- Salute. Cheers.
- Salute. Cheers.

16
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:26,938
- To us.
- To us.

17
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:30,608
Mm.

18
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:32,527
It's so good, this wine.

19
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:33,694
Thanks.

20
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:34,987
Why?

21
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,782
'Cause there's no way I would've
found this pIace on my own.

22
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:41,994
I need a guide...

23
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,579
to show me around.

24
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,207
I'll pay you.

25
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:52,463
Oh, I'm drunk.

26
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,970
Where are you from?
Where is the accent from?

27
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,805
- Oh. New Jersey.
- Oh, yeah?

28
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:02,390
Yeah.

29
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:04,100
That's nice.

30
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,352
Excuse me.

31
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,606
Are you Bailey Euler?

32
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:52,982
Yeah.

33
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,152
The brother of Susan Euler?

34
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,738
Susan? Yeah, why?

35
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:02,992
- Do you know where she is?
- Yes, monsieur, yes.

36
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:06,579
Well?

37
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,582
She died.

38
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:14,587
She what?

39
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,672
I'm sorry.
I didn't want to be the one

40
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,008
to tell you this, but...

41
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,178
I promised
to bring her back home.

42
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,726
What the hell is that?

43
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,857
It, um-- she wrote
you a letter, too.

44
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:37,818
Whoa, ho-- ho--

45
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,613
and how do you
know my sister?

46
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:46,619
She was my wife.

47
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:03,552
# Ain't no use in calling up
your friends #

48
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:09,558
# Ain't no use in hiding
in your bed #

49
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,940
# It ain't no use in standing
on your head #

50
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:22,822
# 'Cause no new sights
can fill your loneliness #

51
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:29,996
# Seven days of time
to fix your head #

52
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:35,334
# Seven days of time
you walk the ledge #

53
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:40,631
# And every time
you catch a sight #

54
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:44,010
# Of your reflection,
you can't decide #

55
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:48,431
# If you should cry
or if it's time to laugh #

56
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:19,962
# Can't count how many times
I've heard you say #

57
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:26,177
# You'd give up all you got
for just a day #

58
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:31,223
# There ain't no use
in cutting through #

59
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,518
# The darkness
that envelops you #

60
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:38,355
# You have to let
the light come in instead. #

61
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:48,991
You gotta throw it, Dad.

62
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,785
Okay, Marty, get ready.

63
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,912
- I'm gonna throw you a long one.
- Wiley!

64
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,872
What, Mary?
We're playing ball.

65
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,373
All right, stop, turn around,
here it comes.

66
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,375
Okay, I got it.

67
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:02,046
Oh, Marty, put
your hands up, not out!

68
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:04,048
"No, Marty.

69
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:07,802
You gotta put
your hands up, not out."

70
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,762
Why you gotta make it
so hard on him?

71
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,097
Why do you?

72
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,057
Look at him.
He can't move, Mary.

73
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:14,892
He's bundled up like
a pig in a blanket.

74
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,729
You know, he can do this.
He just needs to try harder, all right?

75
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:20,648
He does try. He's just never
good enough for you.

76
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:22,149
Yeah, well, I'm not
giving up on him.

77
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:23,442
I haven't given up on him.

78
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,736
No, you'd just settle
for anything he gives you.

79
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:28,280
I've made my peace with it.
Why can't you?

80
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,740
Because he's grown up.
Look at him.

81
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,742
He's not a little kid any more.

82
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,702
- I keep hoping--
- Don't.

83
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,929
Bailey.

84
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:53,430
Get up.

85
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,979
Bailey, are you dead?

86
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:01,647
Bailey's stupid.

87
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:04,108
Summer's over
but he slept on the beach.

88
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:05,442
Hey, Bailey.

89
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,986
Watch, I'll get him up.
Hey.

90
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,529
- Hey, come on. That's not funny.
- Come on.

91
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,283
What's up, Wiley?

92
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,784
Not you, that's for sure.

93
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:16,162
What should we do?

94
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,955
You and Marty go home.
I'll take care of it.

95
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:19,623
- You sure?
- Yeah.

96
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,920
Marty, you think you
can take Mom home?

97
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,006
- I don't know.
- Give it a shot for me, all right?

98
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,549
Dad's gotta take care of Bailey.

99
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,467
All right.

100
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,721
All right, let's go, come on.

101
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:34,889
Let's go, up.

102
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,769
So...
Susan's dead.

103
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,646
Hey, come on.
Stop, man.

104
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,523
Don't think that way, all right?

105
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,859
You don't wanna
do that, Bailey.

106
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:21,435
Bailey, what's going on with you?

107
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:33,447
A French guy showed up
at the park

108
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:36,659
with a-- an urn.

109
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,662
He showed up with an urn
with Susan's ashes in it.

110
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,998
My sister came back
in a fucking can.

111
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,921
Bailey, you sure?

112
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:52,549
Yeah, yeah.
He brought a letter from her.

113
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:56,971
Yeah, I'm sure.

114
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:00,099
I don't believe it.

115
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,892
Believe it.

116
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,066
She had cancer.
She--

117
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:12,069
she didn't tell nobody.
She went to Paris, she got married,

118
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:13,696
and, uh...

119
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,074
he brought her home.

120
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,333
I don't know what
to say, man.

121
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:28,043
Me neither.

122
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:32,881
You know something?

123
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,801
Helpin' the two of you is...

124
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:41,432
is, like, the one good thing
I've ever done in my life.

125
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,437
And she's gone, man.

126
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,439
I can't believe she's gone.

127
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:57,531
You know, my sister's dead
and all I keep thinking about...

128
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:00,951
is my old man.

129
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:05,873
He's never gonna
get out of my head.

130
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,462
Yeah, well...

131
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:16,091
we sure hit the jackpot when it
comes to fathers, didn't we?

132
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:17,509
Yep.

133
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:22,598
I still think mine
was the biggest prick of all.

134
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:26,602
Well, he got the worst of it.

135
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,146
- And how's that?
- He's dead, isn't he?

136
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:31,899
Hey.

137
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:36,945
They both got what
they deserved, all right?

138
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:45,412
Yeah.

139
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,001
But, uh...

140
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,089
we gotta pay for our sins.

141
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,843
Yeah, we do.

142
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:02,471
Yes, we do.

143
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,936
Mom, Bailey's up.

144
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,440
Hey, hey, hey,
sweetie, sweetie.

145
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,900
- Stop playing for a sec, okay?
- Okay.

146
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:59,445
Go downstairs.
I'll see you in a moment, okay?

147
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,739
Hey! Martin!

148
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,741
Okay, I'll play later.

149
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:10,914
How you feeling?

150
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:13,375
Like a harmonica
ran me over.

151
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,879
What time is it?

152
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,380
It's almost noon.

153
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,893
I feel like I'm dreaming.

154
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,728
Why's that?

155
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,814
Seeing you...

156
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,649
in that window.

157
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,612
Like I'm 17 years old again.

158
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:45,616
You still have the ladder?

159
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:51,872
Yeah.

160
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,791
Want me to go get it?

161
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,597
You still think I could
make it across?

162
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,182
No way.

163
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,560
Yeah, probably not.

164
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,648
You could've broken
your neck, you know.

165
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,653
You were worth it.

166
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:31,328
Give me a sec, okay?

167
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:33,664
I'll come over,
I'll make you some coffee.

168
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:05,904
Bonjour.

169
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,197
Ciao.

170
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,867
Hey, it's my brother-in-law!

171
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,455
What can I do for you?

172
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,666
Well, a coffee would be nice.

173
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,376
Yeah?

174
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:21,587
Uh, but there's...

175
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,505
something that...

176
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:25,007
you know,
has been bugging me

177
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,593
that I want to
clear up first, okay?

178
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,469
What? What is?

179
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:33,640
When my sister left,

180
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:36,226
she had a shitload
of money with her.

181
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:37,644
You know where it is?

182
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:40,272
That's why--
the coffee is easier

183
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,065
to speak about
difficult things, you know?

184
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,985
Well, I know, but I've already
had a cup of coffee,

185
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:48,655
so you know
anything about it?

186
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:50,490
Okay, this.

187
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:54,036
Paper.

188
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:57,497
Here.

189
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,708
Okay, this is...

190
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:01,835
certificate of marriage.

191
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:05,839
- Wedding, you know?
- Oh.

192
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:07,132
It's nice.

193
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,508
And this...

194
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,428
this is the letter,
the testament.

195
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:14,640
I want you read.

196
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,808
- Basically--
- It's in French.

197
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,518
Yes.

198
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:21,313
It says, it says that I own

199
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:26,151
half of the house
on 3rd Street.

200
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:29,071
64.
64 3rd Street.

201
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,114
I think, yes.

202
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:36,119
- This house?
- Yes, yes.

203
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:37,663
64.

204
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,415
She left you half
of this house.

205
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,292
Yes, her half of the house.

206
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,877
My house.

207
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:45,796
Our house.

208
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:51,426
I promised her to take
only the half...

209
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:54,137
was her, you know?

210
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:59,726
That's-- that's what it say.

211
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,110
Not right now, okay, sweetie?

212
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,029
What's your name?

213
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,656
I forgot.

214
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:15,283
- Jacques.
- Jacques.

215
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,661
- Yeah.
- Jacques.

216
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:20,330
- Jacques.
- Jacques.

217
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:22,124
You can call me Jack, yeah?

218
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,835
- Easy.
- Jack and Jill went up the hill.

219
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,586
Jack and Jill went up the hill.

220
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,004
- Marty, no.
- Jack and Jill went up--

221
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,466
Yeah.

222
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,343
You play the harmonica, Jack?

223
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:36,012
No, but you can teach me.

224
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,180
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

225
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:39,015
Very good, yeah.

226
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:44,396
So what do you want?

227
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,231
Money?

228
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,400
No.
I'm here for work.

229
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:51,611
- Work?
- Yes, Susan say that...

230
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,697
uh, we can be
a good team.

231
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:56,742
- You and me.
- Yeah? Why's that.

232
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,079
Kids love me.

233
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,873
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

234
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:29,024
What am I gonna do
about this guy?

235
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:30,901
Put him to work.

236
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,028
And I gotta live
with this asshole?

237
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,549
Why would she do this?

238
00:18:58,346 --> 00:18:59,554
Hey.

239
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:02,098
Mommy likes Bailey a lot, huh?

240
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,642
Yeah.

241
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:09,105
They're best friends.

242
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,108
- You know why?
- Why?

243
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,569
They grew up together.

244
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:18,281
My mom lived in

245
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:21,284
that house next door...

246
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:24,496
when she was a little girl.

247
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,623
And now we come over
to make sure

248
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,834
the furnace doesn't explode.

249
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,505
Her name was
Mary O'Connell.

250
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,383
And she lived
with Grandpa O'Connell.

251
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:38,718
And he died.

252
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,555
He's gone already.

253
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,057
He owned the hot dog stand
at the roller coaster.

254
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:46,101
I know it
'cause my dad owns it.

255
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:49,771
He owns everything
in the amusement park.

256
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:53,316
He owns the roller coaster...

257
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:56,152
and the bumper cars...

258
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,822
and the Tilt-a-Whirl...

259
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,825
and the Tornado.

260
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:04,327
Your dad must be
a rich man, eh?

261
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,582
Yeah.

262
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,669
We live in a...

263
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,421
mansion.

264
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:16,715
- Wow.
- Yeah.

265
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:19,342
But he doesn't like hot dogs.

266
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,886
I love hot dogs.

267
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,137
Me, too.

268
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:24,931
I can eat a hundred hot dogs.

269
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:26,224
Wow.

270
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:29,561
How many hot dogs
can you eat?

271
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,521
Don't tell to anybody,

272
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:33,732
but I can eat 101.

273
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:38,820
Maybe my mom
will let us get some.

274
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:40,447
Oh, yeah.

275
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:42,574
- I'll ask her.
- Wait.

276
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,868
Mom?

277
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:47,412
Can Jack and I get a hot dog?

278
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,916
Uh, maybe later, sweetie.

279
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,169
Jack wants a hot dog!

280
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:55,712
I've had it with this French fuck.

281
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,213
- Come on.
- Wait, wait, wait.

282
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,382
Bailey, Bailey, Bailey.
Hold up.

283
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,051
What?

284
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,011
What if he's tellin'
the truth, huh?

285
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,888
What if this really is
what Susan wanted?

286
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:07,390
Come on, it's bullshit.
He's coning us.

287
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:09,684
I mean, look at him.

288
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,853
He could be in pain,
too, you know.

289
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:16,900
Yeah, poor him.

290
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:20,403
He's probably in there trying
to figure out how to get rid of me,

291
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:23,573
take the whole fucking house.

292
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:41,800
Fuck.

293
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:53,186
Be careful with it, okay?

294
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:54,521
Name it.

295
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:55,897
Did you-- okay,
you gotta name it.

296
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:57,273
That's a good idea.

297
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,401
- Bailey'll name it.
- Go on.

298
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:02,278
Aw, fuck!

299
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,323
You need help?

300
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:06,992
No.

301
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,702
Bailey, look what I got.

302
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,163
Oh, yeah?

303
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,456
Where'd you get that?

304
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:15,166
Jack won the ring toss.

305
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,793
Take that.

306
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:18,378
How'd he do that?

307
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:22,632
You know? Here.

308
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,886
I cut the ring so it could fit
the bottle, you know?

309
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,888
They cheat, we cheat.

310
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:33,601
Hey, Bailey, is it okay if I
leave Martin with you for a bit?

311
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,770
Yeah, sure.

312
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:38,314
I'll pick you up later, okay?

313
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,316
- Okay.
- Come on.

314
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:43,820
Hey, be careful
with that, you know?

315
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:47,115
I would not force so much
this mechanism, you know?

316
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:49,034
Is very delicate.

317
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:53,204
What, do you want me to give it
a little French kiss, huh?

318
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,672
Uh, I know this machine.

319
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,008
I can fix it Bailey,

320
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:06,509
but I need your help,
you know?

321
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:08,553
We have to, uh...

322
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,680
You know?

323
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,974
Is out of, um...

324
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:15,226
How you say, not in line?

325
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,686
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

326
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:20,065
So you need-- you wanna
do that, huh? Paisano?

327
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,691
What, are you Italian now?

328
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:23,902
Eh, a little bit of everything.

329
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,445
How about Vaffanculo?

330
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:26,780
Bravo, pow.

331
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,823
Forza.

332
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:30,075
Come on.

333
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,035
Okay? Uno...

334
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:34,245
- Fuck you.
- ...due...

335
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,873
- Rotten bastard.
- ...tre, come on.

336
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,374
God damn it.

337
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:42,337
Ow, fuck.

338
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:45,590
Yeah.
We fix it.

339
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:46,925
Bravo.

340
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:25,588
- Where's Marty?
- Jesus.

341
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:31,177
You scared the shit
out of me.

342
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,973
- Sorry. - He's at the
kiddie park with Bailey.

343
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,601
You hungry?

344
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:42,230
Yeah, I'm hungry.

345
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:45,150
I'm sorry.

346
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:48,111
This stuff with Susan,

347
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:49,904
it's hard to deal with, you know?'

348
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:51,990
Yeah, it doesn't
change anything, you know?

349
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:55,869
I'm worried about Bailey.

350
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,787
Susan was his whole life.

351
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,999
Bailey's gonna be fine.

352
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:02,458
You just need
to leave him alone.

353
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,419
I can't leave him alone.

354
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:07,172
What, I have to put you
under lock and key?

355
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,673
That's not funny.

356
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:10,967
Uh, joking.

357
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:12,969
Come on.

358
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:14,220
Come on, Wiley.
Stop it.

359
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:15,388
No, come on.

360
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:17,056
- Come on, I said stop it.
- Come on.

361
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,474
Come on, I mean it.

362
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,018
No, come on,
not like this.

363
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:22,520
- I can fuck any way I want it.
- No!

364
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:25,565
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

365
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,654
I feel like I'm losing you, Mary.

366
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:49,714
# You got nobody #

367
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:50,882
# In the world... #

368
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,009
Shit.

369
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:55,428
Fucking lucky
son of a bitch.

370
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:57,555
Hey, Wiley.
You wanna shut the fuck up?

371
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:59,349
Hey, fuck you, asshole.
I got money on this.

372
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:00,516
Fuck you.

373
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,101
Why don't you relax, Vinnie?

374
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:07,398
Come on.

375
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:20,870
Hey, you wanna go
for a ride?

376
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:23,748
What, you're not
going home?

377
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:27,293
No, I'm in the dog house.

378
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:29,212
How come?

379
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,588
I fucked up, Bailey.

380
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:32,590
I don't now what
I'm doing anymore.

381
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:35,051
Who does?

382
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:37,720
Nah, it's different.

383
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:39,973
It's like I see it
in her eyes, man.

384
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,350
She just--

385
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:44,477
she's waiting for me
to screw up.

386
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:56,948
Hey.

387
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:58,992
Open the door.

388
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:02,578
God, I miss 'em, Bailey.

389
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:05,248
What?

390
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:06,833
Big rides.

391
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,670
They're so great when they're
lit up in the summer.

392
00:27:25,728 --> 00:27:26,894
What are you doing?

393
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:30,189
Come on, cut the crap.
It's freezing out.

394
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,734
Shh, shh, shh.
She's listening.

395
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,195
Who?

396
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:37,947
Susan.

397
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:41,576
She loved these rides.

398
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:44,203
Remember the--
what was it, the Tornado?

399
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46,331
What, did we take her on that thing,
like, a thousand times?

400
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,713
I can still hear her screaming.

401
00:27:57,885 --> 00:28:00,219
God, I miss
those times, Bailey.

402
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:46,516
Get on the stupid ride.

403
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:49,852
All right, we got guns!

404
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,611
One for you...

405
00:28:58,779 --> 00:28:59,904
one for you...

406
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:01,447
one for me.

407
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:04,117
Indians don't get guns.
Only cowboys do.

408
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:05,535
- Who says so?
- Yeah, only cowboys.

409
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,370
- Who says so?
- You're dumb.

410
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:09,872
Indians only get
bows and arrows.

411
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,542
- Everyone knows that.
- Yeah, everyone knows that.

412
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,836
Well, I traded some wampum
for some guns for us.

413
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,254
Can I have bows and arrows?

414
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:18,297
No, no, no. You gotta have a gun, Mart.
It's all we got.

415
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,550
Mom says I can't play with guns.

416
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:22,343
Yeah, well she's right.
Uh...

417
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:24,554
we're gonna say water pistols.
These are water pistols.

418
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,139
- They're not guns.
- Okay, water pistol.

419
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,015
- There.
- Exciting.

420
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,059
Get on the stupid ride.

421
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:31,811
We'll start the ride.
All right.

422
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:36,315
Hi-ho Silver, away!

423
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:37,692
All right,
circle the wagons!

424
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,152
Indians on the warpath!

425
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:42,321
There it goes.
Oh, God, no.

426
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,740
Circle the wagons,
Indians on the warpath!

427
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:52,415
This ride stinks.
Come on.

428
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:54,750
Hey, hey, give me
back the guns!

429
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,919
Gimme the guns!

430
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:01,757
- It broke.
- You guys were great.

431
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:05,678
- Ma, I need a hot dog.
- Okay.

432
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:07,305
Okay, if you stay
where I can see you, okay?

433
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:09,265
Okay.

434
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:11,809
No, I got it, I got it,
I got it. Here.

435
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:14,937
Hi-ho, Silver, away!

436
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,775
You made one kid
pretty happy.

437
00:30:21,904 --> 00:30:23,863
Can't run this ride
on one kid.

438
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,121
Things'll pick up.

439
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:33,748
Oh, you think so?

440
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:35,291
Look at this place.

441
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,211
I mean, I...

442
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,046
I don't know what to do.
Without Susan, it's just--

443
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:41,797
it's not the same,
you know?

444
00:30:53,143 --> 00:30:54,185
Come on, Ma.

445
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:55,520
I know, just let me
get my eyes open.

446
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,396
Come on.
No, you close your eyes.

447
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:59,148
- Oh, close my eyes.
- Yeah.

448
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:00,399
- Okay.
- Watch out.

449
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:01,859
I'm watching out.

450
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:03,819
- Sit down.
- Okay.

451
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:06,280
Sit.
Open your eyes!

452
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:08,282
Open, read it.

453
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:10,576
- Read it.
- "Wiley loves Mary."

454
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:12,745
Yeah, "Wiley loves Mary."

455
00:31:12,913 --> 00:31:15,081
- How'd you do that?
- We did it together.

456
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
- Yeah.
- Right, Marty?

457
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:20,503
Yeah. You like it?

458
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:24,840
Mary, I'm sorry.

459
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:29,136
I know I screwed up,
and I know sorry doesn't cut it.

460
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,181
But things are gonna
be different, okay?

461
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,228
I'm gonna do better.

462
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:40,106
For you and for Marty.

463
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:43,401
I mean it.
Okay?

464
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,821
I promise.

465
00:31:46,989 --> 00:31:49,657
Yeah, Mom.
Dad's really sorry.

466
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,452
Can I eat them now,
Dad, pIease?

467
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:57,081
Sure, go ahead, pal.

468
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:23,691
What are you doing?

469
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:28,070
I'm looking for Susan's diary,
you know?

470
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:30,239
She doesn't have a diary.

471
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,577
Yes, she had one.

472
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:37,955
Well, it's not here
'cause I tore this place apart

473
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:40,916
when she left,
and I didn't find a diary.

474
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:48,090
Listen, she told me
she had one and...

475
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:52,219
she had it in--
how you call it--

476
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,557
She call it Esmeralda.

477
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:57,850
Is a-- is a--

478
00:32:58,018 --> 00:32:59,560
- A teddy bear.
- Yes, a teddy bear.

479
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:02,021
You know what
I'm talking about?

480
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:05,775
Yeah.

481
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:22,958
- Mm, yes.
- So?

482
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:26,253
She told me
that you won that

483
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,923
when she was
a little girl, right?

484
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:30,966
Yeah.

485
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,968
What else she tell you?

486
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,804
She told me...

487
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:37,973
to give you...

488
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:43,813
give you this.

489
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:32,278
Yes!

490
00:34:32,446 --> 00:34:34,321
Yes, okay.

491
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:35,781
Go, get the ring.

492
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,116
Bravo, bravo.

493
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,119
One more, one more.

494
00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:42,413
I want see more.
Bravo, bravo.

495
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,373
Oh, brava.

496
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:46,208
- Alex did it.
- Jacques: Good.

497
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:48,085
Bravo, bravo.
Very good.

498
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:49,628
- We got a dropper.
- Okay.

499
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,213
- Ah-ah, you missed one.
- You dropped it.

500
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:52,923
Okay.

501
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:55,509
That turn is finished.

502
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:57,011
That's it.
Easy now.

503
00:34:57,179 --> 00:34:59,013
Everybody home.
See you tomorrow.

504
00:34:59,181 --> 00:35:00,723
Ciao.
Okay, let's go.

505
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:02,308
How many did you catch?

506
00:35:02,476 --> 00:35:03,768
Five?

507
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,020
Oh, oh, hold on, hold on.

508
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:07,897
Give the ticket
to Marty, okay?

509
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,065
Very good.
And now we start again.

510
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,401
Kids, train's pulling out!

511
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:20,201
Last chance!

512
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,663
- Hey.
- Fuck.

513
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,043
- Come on, give me a ride.
- You gotta buy a ticket.

514
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:30,461
I'm the landlord,
remember?

515
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:32,087
Yeah, well, things
are tough all over.

516
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,089
Yeah.

517
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,592
You just gonna sit there,
or you gonna start the thing?

518
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:41,764
Got nothing else to do.

519
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:43,849
I can see it.

520
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:49,980
You missed out!

521
00:35:53,527 --> 00:35:56,237
And, uh, give me
the spiel, too, okay?

522
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,572
- What spiel?
- "What spiel"? The bullshit you say

523
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,574
that makes this ridiculous
thing fun.

524
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:02,576
You gotta pay for bullshit.

525
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:04,495
Come on, at least
blow the whistle.

526
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:06,747
- 50 cents.
- 50 cents, huh?

527
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:08,290
You want 50 cents?

528
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,169
Here, keep the change.
Blow it twice.

529
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,714
Nice catch.

530
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:20,970
That's a pathetic whistle,
you know that?

531
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,972
All right, boys and girls.

532
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:26,100
Atlantic Coastline
going down the straightaway.

533
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:28,811
- Unbelievable.
- Here we go.

534
00:36:28,979 --> 00:36:30,771
Bailey, there's your
French buddy.

535
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:32,314
Feel the wind in your hair.

536
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:34,400
Yeah, maybe you should
borrow his spiel.

537
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:37,570
No, seriously, man.
If he can bring in

538
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,697
business like this
in the winter,

539
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:41,156
we might actually make
some money in the summer.

540
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:45,536
Well, the kids like a change.
It'll pass.

541
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,037
Go, quick, you got it!

542
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,706
He's got the look.

543
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:50,332
What's that, tight pants?

544
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,751
No, it's called success,
Bailey.

545
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,879
I didn't think
you'd recognize it.

546
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:58,007
It's one ride.

547
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:03,095
Yeah, well, lucky me that one ride's
sittin' on my real estate.

548
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:07,850
You know, I've been really fair
to you over the years.

549
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:10,394
Yeah, meaning what?

550
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,565
Meaning, if you're
making money now,

551
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:16,817
I think it's about time
I raise your rent a little bit.

552
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,863
Since when
do you need money?

553
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:25,284
Don't worry about
what I need.

554
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:31,749
I've always bailed you out,
no questions asked.

555
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:36,587
Now it's your turn, okay?

556
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:37,922
- Hi, Dad.
- It's your turn.

557
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,548
Hey, pal.
How are ya?

558
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:42,051
- Good.
- Listen, I got a great idea.

559
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:44,887
What do you say we blow this dump
and get a couple hot dogs, huh?

560
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:48,933
No, that's okay, Dad.
I have to stay and help Bailey.

561
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,684
- I'm his partner.
- Yeah.

562
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:53,020
I've gotta blow the whistle.

563
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:57,232
Okay, pal.

564
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,443
You blow the whistle.

565
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:12,581
Okay, you ready? Go.

566
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:15,000
Come catch it, okay?

567
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:20,130
Okay, I wanna see you
getting more rings.

568
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:30,099
# Long afloat #

569
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:33,644
# On shipless oceans #

570
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:36,897
# I did all my best #

571
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:40,109
# To smile #

572
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:43,612
# Till your singing #

573
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:47,741
# Eyes and fingers #

574
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:50,327
# Drew me loving #

575
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:55,416
#To your isle #

576
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,460
# And you sang #

577
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:01,547
# Sail to me #

578
00:39:01,715 --> 00:39:06,802
# Sail to me,
let me enfold you #

579
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:15,269
# Here I am #

580
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:18,397
# Waiting #

581
00:39:18,565 --> 00:39:24,153
# To hold you #

582
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:31,577
# Did I dream#

583
00:39:31,745 --> 00:39:35,789
# You dreamed about me? #

584
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:38,125
# Were you hare #

585
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:43,088
# When I was fox? #

586
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:47,384
# Now my foolish boat #

587
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:50,345
# Is leaning #

588
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,765
# Broken lovelorn #

589
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:57,436
# On your rocks #

590
00:39:57,604 --> 00:40:01,023
# For you sing #

591
00:40:01,191 --> 00:40:04,401
# Touch me not #

592
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:09,782
# Touch me not,
come back tomorrow #

593
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:15,621
# Oh, my heart #

594
00:40:15,789 --> 00:40:17,915
# Oh, my heart... #

595
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:24,963
# Shies from the sorrow #

596
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:34,807
# I'm as puzzled #

597
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:38,393
# As the newborn child #

598
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:41,230
# I'm as troubled #

599
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:45,234
# As the tide #

600
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:49,071
# Should I stand #

601
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:52,533
# Amid the breakers? #

602
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,327
# Or should I lie #

603
00:40:55,495 --> 00:41:00,374
# With death my bride? #

604
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:03,752
# Hear me sing #

605
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,339
# Swim to me #

606
00:41:07,507 --> 00:41:10,843
# Swim to me,
let me unfold... #

607
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,469
I've thought about it,

608
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:15,305
and I'm just gonna take
that money with me.

609
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:16,598
I don't know where
it came from,

610
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:19,184
or why Bailey
buried it out there.

611
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:22,646
But I do know he's
never been the same since.

612
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:25,607
I care about him
so much it hurts.

613
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:30,112
Besides, it's not doing
any good where it is.

614
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,990
So what's the harm?

615
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:35,742
Okay, can you
take this one, please?

616
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:46,879
Look, aren't they
beautiful, Bailey?

617
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,297
I love it.

618
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:49,464
We're gonna make
a fortune with this.

619
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:52,301
Ah, merde.
Lost one.

620
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,222
I wanna say hello
to Bailey and Jack!

621
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:59,183
No, no, no, Martin.
Not today!

622
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,145
Bailey!

623
00:42:03,313 --> 00:42:05,647
Hey, Jack.
What are you doing?

624
00:42:05,815 --> 00:42:07,524
Hey, where you been all week?

625
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:09,359
- Home with mom.
- Yeah?

626
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,569
- Yeah.
- Marty come here.

627
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:11,987
- I have a job for you, come.
- Okay.

628
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:13,197
Hey, there,
how are you? Good?

629
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,282
- Where is your mom?
- Over there.

630
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:16,909
Look at this, huh?

631
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:18,952
You see?
You have to tie it up here.

632
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,997
And after, we put it
all over here, look.

633
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:24,166
Hey.

634
00:42:24,334 --> 00:42:26,668
Come, give it to me. Give it to me.

635
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:30,005
- Wait, okay.
- You can have some.

636
00:42:30,173 --> 00:42:31,798
Oh, thank you.

637
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,009
Where you been?

638
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:36,678
Around.

639
00:42:37,931 --> 00:42:39,014
- Want a balloon?
- Try to tie it here.

640
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:41,225
Sure. Ha.

641
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:46,021
You shouldn't keep Martin
away from us all week.

642
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:47,773
- We need him.
- Yeah, Mom.

643
00:42:47,941 --> 00:42:50,525
I gotta help Bailey
and Jack, see?

644
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:53,528
Yes, Jacques is...

645
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,072
...with the balloons, eh?

646
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,657
What's "Trey mal dwa"?

647
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,742
That is "two thumbs up,"
you know?

648
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,535
- "Two thumbs up."
- Yes.

649
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,246
Yeah, yeah.

650
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,748
Yeah, it's tough
when he's not around.

651
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:08,418
Hold it, hold it.

652
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,713
What's with the sunglasses?

653
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:14,508
Yeah?

654
00:43:14,676 --> 00:43:16,635
I mean, you know...

655
00:43:19,055 --> 00:43:20,722
Wait, come on.
No, don't. Give them--

656
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:23,600
Come on, give 'em back.

657
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,356
How'd you get that?

658
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:32,985
Cabinet door in the kitchen.

659
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:34,987
Really stupid.
Didn't see it was open

660
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:37,447
till I-- pfft--
smacked right into it.

661
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:40,492
Gotta be more careful.
I say it to Martin all the time,

662
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:43,203
but, uh, I don't take
my own advice.

663
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:46,415
Marty, you a big boy, right?

664
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:47,833
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

665
00:43:48,001 --> 00:43:50,002
So you have to be careful.
Look at Mommy.

666
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:51,586
You have to close
the cabinet door when you open.

667
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,547
It wasn't me.

668
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,723
All right, that's it, that's it.
Let's go home.

669
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:05,017
No, no, no, we will-- let--
wait and see what's happening.

670
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:07,185
No, don't wait and see.
Just take the balloons...

671
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:09,146
and put them in the ticket thing
and I'll cover the rides.

672
00:44:09,314 --> 00:44:10,897
- Okay, okay.
- Come on, come on.

673
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,357
- We're gonna go home.
- Come here, Marty.

674
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:14,276
- Go say good-bye to Bailey and Jack.
- Well, where are they going?

675
00:44:14,444 --> 00:44:15,444
- Marty.
- Home.

676
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:19,740
- Can we go with them?
- No, no, sweetie. Not today.

677
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,199
No, why don't you
come on over?

678
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:23,118
No. No, Bailey.

679
00:44:23,286 --> 00:44:25,704
I wanna go
with Bailey and Jack!

680
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:27,497
Do you wanna
go see a movie?

681
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:30,417
- Yeah.
- Okay. Then say good-bye.

682
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:34,379
Okay.
Good-bye, Mr. Mouse.

683
00:44:35,465 --> 00:44:37,299
See ya soon, Mr. Flea.

684
00:44:37,467 --> 00:44:39,468
- Okay, that sounds good.
- I know.

685
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:41,720
Be careful, okay?
Take it easy.

686
00:44:41,888 --> 00:44:43,680
- Okay.
- Ciao.

687
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:45,307
Ciao.

688
00:44:56,152 --> 00:44:57,986
Somebody beat her up.

689
00:44:58,154 --> 00:44:59,571
What?

690
00:45:01,491 --> 00:45:03,867
Mary.
She lie about the cabinet.

691
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:05,285
You know?

692
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:09,081
Mary doesn't lie to me.

693
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:11,458
Come on.
So you lie to yourself.

694
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:14,711
Shut up, okay?

695
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,048
Hey, if something that I know,

696
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:20,842
it's the face of a woman
when a man beat her up.

697
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:24,429
Why's that?

698
00:45:26,015 --> 00:45:28,183
What, do you hit women?
Huh?

699
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:30,060
Come on, are you crazy,
or what?

700
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:31,728
You hit my sister?

701
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:33,897
I'm talking about Mary.

702
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:39,194
No, I don't hit your sister.
I didn't hit her, okay?

703
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:44,032
They're afraid.

704
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,410
Mary and the boy,
look at them.

705
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:48,412
Can you see?

706
00:45:49,414 --> 00:45:51,415
And look at you.
Big, strong, and everything

707
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,625
and you cannot help them
in any way.

708
00:45:56,421 --> 00:45:58,213
This must be something
I don't understand.

709
00:45:58,381 --> 00:45:59,631
Yeah, that's right.

710
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:01,967
So just mind
your fucking business.

711
00:46:24,157 --> 00:46:25,240
What?

712
00:46:25,408 --> 00:46:27,325
The door
to Mary's old house is open.

713
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,453
- Who lives there?
- Nobody.

714
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:34,374
Strange.

715
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:32,933
Hey, Wiley,
what are you doing here?

716
00:47:34,644 --> 00:47:36,061
Fuck.

717
00:47:36,229 --> 00:47:38,271
You still crashing the party,
huh, Bailey?

718
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:41,691
What are you doing?

719
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:44,319
I'm living the high life,
asshole.

720
00:47:44,487 --> 00:47:45,612
How 'bout you?

721
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:53,912
Look who's here,
the fucking "French Connection."

722
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:59,292
What the hell is happening to you?

723
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:05,549
I got demons, Bailey.

724
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,217
You got demons.

725
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:09,636
Yeah.

726
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:15,767
You got a wife and a kid,
that's what you got.

727
00:48:15,935 --> 00:48:17,102
Get up.

728
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:20,397
Come on.

729
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:24,234
Hey, I'm messing
with your head.

730
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:26,653
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

731
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:30,240
You selfish idiot.
Come on, let's go.

732
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:32,742
You don't know shit,
you sorry fuck.

733
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,078
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

734
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:49,217
I'm sorry.

735
00:48:49,385 --> 00:48:51,136
You know...

736
00:48:51,304 --> 00:48:53,096
about Susan.

737
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:56,600
I really loved her.

738
00:48:59,604 --> 00:49:01,271
Pretty Susan.

739
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,732
Pretty Black-Eyed Susan.

740
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:07,485
You know, Wiley...

741
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:11,781
I never see
Black-Eyed Susan.

742
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:12,949
Never.

743
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:14,951
Fuck you.

744
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:18,455
You know
what I see? Huh?

745
00:49:18,623 --> 00:49:20,790
I see Black-Eyed Mary.

746
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,584
Yeah? Do you like
Black-Eyed Mary?

747
00:49:22,752 --> 00:49:24,294
- Shut up.
- Do you like Black-Eyed Mary?

748
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:26,713
That's enough.
That's enough.

749
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:28,548
- That's enough.
- What do you think?

750
00:49:28,716 --> 00:49:30,425
What do you think?

751
00:49:34,597 --> 00:49:36,264
I think you've been warned.

752
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:49,444
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to?

753
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:55,575
I don't know, man.

754
00:49:55,743 --> 00:49:57,827
I don't know you anymore.

755
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:00,413
You know me, Bailey.

756
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:02,707
My father was Cabott Reed.

757
00:50:04,293 --> 00:50:06,670
And I'm never gonna let you
forget that.

758
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:25,397
- I want a coke.
- Please?

759
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:27,357
Please. Thank you.

760
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:29,067
Straw?

761
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:30,235
Hey.

762
00:50:30,403 --> 00:50:31,695
What-- what are you
doing here?

763
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,738
I gotta talk to you,
all right?

764
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,574
Martin, Jack's gonna go in
and watch the movie with you.

765
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:39,160
Your mom will be back
in a minute, okay?

766
00:50:39,328 --> 00:50:40,829
Okay.

767
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:52,716
What the hell's going on?

768
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:56,720
Oh, nothing.

769
00:51:06,439 --> 00:51:08,189
Did Wiley hit you?

770
00:51:13,571 --> 00:51:15,989
Why you doin' this?

771
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:20,702
'Cause I wanna know
the truth.

772
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:22,954
You wanna know
the truth.

773
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:27,834
I married Wiley,
I had his kid, okay?

774
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:30,420
For better or worse,
it's what I wanted.

775
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:32,756
What about now?

776
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:37,594
- I don't think about it now.
- You don't think about it now.

777
00:51:37,762 --> 00:51:39,095
No.

778
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:42,223
I mean,
what the fuck happened?

779
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:46,436
We were together,
you know?

780
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,565
And then, one day
I wake up, and...

781
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:52,901
you're married
to my best friend.

782
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:55,153
You were the best thing
in my life,

783
00:51:55,321 --> 00:51:57,280
and then gone.

784
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:17,008
I love you.

785
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:20,261
Please don't do this.

786
00:52:20,429 --> 00:52:23,139
I always have.
I always will.

787
00:52:29,939 --> 00:52:32,398
I can't.
I can't.

788
00:52:34,527 --> 00:52:36,986
- Yeah, we can.
- No, we can't.

789
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:39,823
- We can find a way.
- There is no way out.

790
00:52:40,908 --> 00:52:42,492
No.

791
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:45,995
Why not?

792
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:50,750
He's doing crack,
you know that?

793
00:52:53,796 --> 00:52:56,214
You and Martin shouldn't even
be around him.

794
00:53:06,225 --> 00:53:09,519
There's no protection
from life, Bailey.

795
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:12,522
You know that
better than anyone.

796
00:53:21,657 --> 00:53:23,491
Fresh popcorn for everybody!

797
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:25,702
Wow, beautiful.

798
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:27,495
Okay, bambini,
popcorn for everybody.

799
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:30,123
Oh, this is for Thomas.
Come on, take this one to Thomas.

800
00:53:30,291 --> 00:53:31,374
Come.
You like it?

801
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:33,251
Mm.
See you tomorrow, ciao.

802
00:53:33,419 --> 00:53:35,920
- Okay, next one.
- Jamie's got four.

803
00:53:36,088 --> 00:53:38,548
He's the winner.
Good job, good job.

804
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:39,883
Who's gonna challenge him?

805
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,634
I am!
I am!

806
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:42,844
I can't hear you?

807
00:53:43,012 --> 00:53:45,096
- I am!
- I can't hear you!

808
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:47,223
- I am!
- I am!

809
00:53:49,018 --> 00:53:50,643
- Come on, get off.
- What?

810
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:52,103
Get off.
The ride's for kids. Get off.

811
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:53,688
I'm a kid. Give me a stick.
Come on.

812
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:00,028
All right, here we go!

813
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:02,238
You ready?

814
00:54:03,449 --> 00:54:05,116
Okay, kids.
I'm getting 'em all.

815
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:08,119
Get ready,
I'm gettin' em all.

816
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:10,955
Let's go!

817
00:54:29,058 --> 00:54:30,642
- No!
- Aha!

818
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:50,954
All right, kids.
Bring me all your sticks.

819
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:53,289
You did good.
I know, the big, bad man

820
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:55,291
took all the rings.
Next time.

821
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:57,001
Did you have fun?
Good.

822
00:54:57,169 --> 00:54:59,712
Here you go.
All right, thank you, thank you.

823
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,631
All right, come back.

824
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:04,384
- That was fun.
- Huh?

825
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:05,718
That was fun.

826
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:07,345
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

827
00:55:07,513 --> 00:55:08,972
It's 'cause I won.

828
00:55:11,642 --> 00:55:13,267
Come on,
give me the stick.

829
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:19,357
What do you want?

830
00:55:19,525 --> 00:55:21,109
I want my prize.

831
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:22,485
Yeah?

832
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:24,988
- You want a balloon?
- No, no, no.

833
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,323
- You wish.
- What? What do you want?

834
00:55:27,491 --> 00:55:29,450
Cash.

835
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:33,830
How much?

836
00:55:33,998 --> 00:55:35,790
500 every week.

837
00:55:35,958 --> 00:55:37,792
I can't do that.
It's too much.

838
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:40,670
Really?
Find it.

839
00:56:02,401 --> 00:56:03,985
- Hi.
- Ciao.

840
00:56:04,153 --> 00:56:07,071
- How'd it go today?
- All right.

841
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:09,991
What's this,
no hot dog today?

842
00:56:10,159 --> 00:56:12,368
No, I ate a whole pizza.

843
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:14,787
Mom made me
save you some.

844
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:16,998
- Thanks.
- It's good.

845
00:56:17,166 --> 00:56:18,958
Marty, look at here.
I have a surprise for you.

846
00:56:19,126 --> 00:56:20,668
Hey, Marty.
Look.

847
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:22,128
- What's that?
- It's a football.

848
00:56:22,296 --> 00:56:23,546
Football ball.
Come on, play with me.

849
00:56:23,714 --> 00:56:25,673
Come.
Yeah, we play football, huh?

850
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:26,924
- Yeah.
- Soccer.

851
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:28,718
We call it soccer here, Jacko.

852
00:56:28,886 --> 00:56:31,137
Get it, get it.

853
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:33,431
Can we go?
Can we go to the beach, Ma?

854
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,224
No, sweetie.
Maybe some other time, okay?

855
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:36,809
- I wanna go!
- Throw the ball. Throw the ball.

856
00:56:36,977 --> 00:56:39,437
- Hey, come here.
- Come on, it's gonna get dark soon!

857
00:56:39,605 --> 00:56:40,980
Yeah, but I saw some kids
on the beach.

858
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:43,149
They lighted up some fire
and it looks like fun.

859
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:44,776
It is.

860
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:47,570
We used to make 'em all the time
when we were in high school, remember?

861
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:49,989
- Bailey's were the best.
- Oh, yeah?

862
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:52,742
Okay, Bailey.

863
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:57,580
Come on.
Come. Allez, allez.

864
00:56:57,748 --> 00:56:59,415
Bailey, come on.

865
00:56:59,583 --> 00:57:01,000
Let's go to the beach,
everybody.

866
00:57:01,168 --> 00:57:03,419
Let's go, everybody.
We go to play on the beach.

867
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:05,838
We go to play
on the beach.

868
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:07,924
Kick the ball.
I'll show you, I'll show you.

869
00:57:08,092 --> 00:57:11,511
Hold on, okay.
Play with this, your feet, like this.

870
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:13,638
- You see? Very good.
- Okay.

871
00:57:13,806 --> 00:57:15,348
- Very nice, okay?
- Okay.

872
00:57:15,516 --> 00:57:17,433
- Hold on.
- Not gonna work.

873
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:19,310
Wood's too wet.

874
00:57:19,478 --> 00:57:20,937
You'll get it.

875
00:57:21,105 --> 00:57:22,480
- Move your feet!
- No!

876
00:57:22,648 --> 00:57:24,607
Yeah, you know something
I don't? Try it and see.

877
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:27,235
Take a lesson from Jack.

878
00:57:32,116 --> 00:57:33,825
You know,
you play like this, you see?

879
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:35,284
- I got it. I know.
- Okay?

880
00:57:37,246 --> 00:57:40,081
All right, I got it.
I'll throw it.

881
00:57:40,249 --> 00:57:41,582
Hold on, look at that--
look at this trick.

882
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:43,835
Look at-- no, here.

883
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:45,711
Oh!

884
00:57:48,632 --> 00:57:50,633
- Hold on, hold on.
- Go, Jack!

885
00:57:54,138 --> 00:57:55,596
See?

886
00:57:55,764 --> 00:57:57,140
It takes patience.

887
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:00,643
Yeah, yeah.

888
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:18,286
That water looks really cold.

889
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:19,912
Yeah.

890
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,039
Gotta get way under.

891
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:23,457
Yeah.

892
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:25,209
Wrong season.

893
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:28,963
Never used to stop us.

894
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:31,591
Remember?

895
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:33,843
Yeah, I remember.

896
00:58:38,807 --> 00:58:40,558
I will if you will.

897
00:58:40,726 --> 00:58:42,643
What?

898
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:50,359
- You're crazy.
- Come on.

899
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:52,862
Be crazy with me.

900
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:55,698
- You're kidding, right?
- No.

901
00:58:57,993 --> 00:58:59,160
Come on.

902
00:59:01,205 --> 00:59:02,872
I make a goal.
This is a goal.

903
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,875
Put it down.
Put it down, Marty, right there.

904
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:08,085
And you kick it very slow.
You have to make a goaI.

905
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:09,879
- A boot. Okay?
- Okay.

906
00:59:11,215 --> 00:59:13,216
Yes, goal.

907
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:15,218
Very good.
Hold on, I go.

908
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:16,969
Don't run!
Don't run, Marty!

909
00:59:17,137 --> 00:59:18,512
Don't run, come here!

910
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,556
Come here, Marty.

911
00:59:20,724 --> 00:59:22,391
Come here,
come here, Marty.

912
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,143
Come here. I'm here.
Come on, Marty.

913
00:59:24,311 --> 00:59:26,312
Come, come, come. I'm here.

914
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:29,899
- It's okay, it's okay.
- It's okay.

915
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:33,027
Hey, hey, sweetie.
I'm here. It's okay.

916
00:59:33,195 --> 00:59:35,029
Look at your mommy.
Look at your mommy.

917
00:59:35,197 --> 00:59:36,906
- Open your eyes.
- Martin, I'm right here, look.

918
00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:39,242
You just swallowed
some seawater, that's all.

919
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:41,118
You swallowed
some yucky seawater.

920
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:43,079
It tastes salty.
Does it taste salty?

921
00:59:43,247 --> 00:59:45,248
Taste it.
Like a bad pretzel, right?

922
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:48,000
Yeah, it's yucky seawater,
that's all.

923
00:59:48,168 --> 00:59:50,378
- Aw, it's okay.
- It's salty and it sticks and burns.

924
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:52,880
Look at me.
Look at me, look at me.

925
00:59:53,048 --> 00:59:55,258
Okay, it burns
and it stings, right?

926
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:57,635
But you're okay.
You're okay.

927
00:59:57,803 --> 00:59:59,929
Okay, okay.

928
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:01,597
- Come on, come on.
- It's okay, sweetie. I'm right here.

929
01:00:01,765 --> 01:00:04,350
You okay now?
Mommy's right here, okay?

930
01:00:04,518 --> 01:00:06,602
You okay? You feel better now?
You better?

931
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:08,479
Yes.

932
01:00:08,647 --> 01:00:11,148
It hurts.
It was icky seawater.

933
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:13,526
Yeah, I know.
You sure did.

934
01:00:13,694 --> 01:00:16,487
- I got a boot.
- You got a what?

935
01:00:16,655 --> 01:00:18,281
A boot.

936
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:20,324
It's called--
it's called a goal.

937
01:00:20,492 --> 01:00:22,910
- He did it.
- Put that on.

938
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:50,646
I'm sorry about Marty, okay?
It was an accident.

939
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:54,442
I knew we shouldn't have
come down here.

940
01:00:55,861 --> 01:00:58,404
Come on, Bailey.
He's a kid.

941
01:00:58,572 --> 01:01:00,031
He should have fun.

942
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:01,240
Why don't you go the fuck home

943
01:01:01,408 --> 01:01:03,993
before you ruin everything
in my life, okay?

944
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:06,412
Hey, listen.
I came here, your life was shit.

945
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:08,331
You understand that?
I make it better, remember.

946
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:09,582
- You made it better?
- Yes!

947
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:11,751
How'd you make it better?
Huh?

948
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:13,836
I lost half my fuckin' house,

949
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:16,297
Mary's got a black eye,
Wiley's a fucking crack head

950
01:01:16,465 --> 01:01:18,466
and he wants more money,
and my sister's buried

951
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:20,551
in a fucking ash can
down the beach.

952
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:23,471
How the fuck did you make it better,
motherfucker?

953
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:27,475
Huh, motherfucker?

954
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:32,104
I love her, too.
She was my wife.

955
01:01:32,272 --> 01:01:34,523
She was my fucking wife.

956
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:38,027
And you're lucky or I'd fucking
kill you, motherfucker.

957
01:02:03,595 --> 01:02:04,970
What did you say?

958
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:07,390
He want more money?
Huh?

959
01:02:12,896 --> 01:02:14,897
Yeah, he wants more money.

960
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:17,233
He wants $500
every fucking weekend.

961
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:19,985
How's that grab ya?

962
01:02:34,084 --> 01:02:37,253
# Will put me right down
in a hole #

963
01:02:41,842 --> 01:02:43,717
# Ooh, yeah #

964
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:45,845
# Wild ride... #

965
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:48,264
Ciao, Jaquimo.

966
01:02:48,432 --> 01:02:50,349
"Come este?"

967
01:02:50,517 --> 01:02:52,017
"Como estai," Terri.
"Como estai."

968
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:53,436
Right. Como estai?

969
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:56,021
Gimme the same, please.

970
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:58,065
You got it, Jacquimo.

971
01:03:06,241 --> 01:03:08,200
I wish I had a cigarette.

972
01:03:08,368 --> 01:03:10,161
So get one.

973
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:14,748
I can't.
Susan made me quit.

974
01:03:19,588 --> 01:03:21,297
You surprise me.

975
01:03:21,465 --> 01:03:22,465
You know?

976
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:24,508
You're not afraid to beat
the shit out of me,

977
01:03:24,676 --> 01:03:26,135
but you don't
do nothing to Wiley.

978
01:03:26,303 --> 01:03:28,179
Nothing.

979
01:03:33,894 --> 01:03:35,895
You know, Wiley and me,
we had this competition.

980
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:37,646
We'd...

981
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:39,315
drink.

982
01:03:39,483 --> 01:03:41,108
And whoever's left standing
at the end of the night

983
01:03:41,276 --> 01:03:42,902
would make sure
the other one got home.

984
01:03:45,113 --> 01:03:46,614
Wanna try?

985
01:03:50,744 --> 01:03:52,161
Salud.

986
01:03:54,706 --> 01:03:56,874
Terri!

987
01:03:59,503 --> 01:04:00,628
Two more.

988
01:04:06,635 --> 01:04:08,511
Wanna know how we met,
Wiley and me?

989
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:09,929
Hmm?

990
01:04:16,811 --> 01:04:18,312
In a cop car.

991
01:04:19,606 --> 01:04:20,648
We were the big--

992
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:22,650
biggest juvenile delinquents
in the town,

993
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:24,652
and we both got arrested
on the same night.

994
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:26,987
We ended up in the back
of the same car.

995
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:32,660
We had nothing in common.
We just--

996
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:36,830
just think that we both hated
our fuckin' fathers so much.

997
01:04:43,213 --> 01:04:45,339
Susan ever tell you
about Daddy?

998
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,302
No.

999
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:52,304
Mm.

1000
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:56,517
Billy Euler.

1001
01:04:57,602 --> 01:04:59,562
Everybody called him Rooster,
and he was...

1002
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:03,732
he was a tough fucker, man.

1003
01:05:05,235 --> 01:05:06,944
I was no joke
when I was 18 years old,

1004
01:05:07,112 --> 01:05:09,154
and he threw me around
like I was nothing.

1005
01:05:12,492 --> 01:05:14,785
He used to come home...

1006
01:05:14,953 --> 01:05:16,245
you know...

1007
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:18,330
smack my mother around
the kitchen a little bit,

1008
01:05:18,498 --> 01:05:20,165
give me a few pops
in the face,

1009
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:22,251
go up to bed whistlin'.

1010
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:28,757
What about...

1011
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:30,259
Wiley's father?

1012
01:05:30,427 --> 01:05:33,762
Oh, he was
a fucking reptile.

1013
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,639
He'd look at you
with those eyes, man,

1014
01:05:35,807 --> 01:05:38,267
you feel like you did something wrong.
You didn't even do anything.

1015
01:05:39,853 --> 01:05:41,437
Cold, man.

1016
01:05:41,605 --> 01:05:43,856
All he gave a shit about
was money.

1017
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,901
And making Wiley
feel like shit.

1018
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:52,781
He fucking hated Wiley, man.

1019
01:05:56,286 --> 01:05:57,828
At least the competition...

1020
01:05:57,996 --> 01:06:00,956
between the two fathers
was equal? Huh?

1021
01:06:04,002 --> 01:06:05,544
Yeah, maybe.

1022
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:09,131
Until my mother died...

1023
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:11,342
and Rooster started making
his little trips

1024
01:06:11,509 --> 01:06:13,802
into Susan's bedroom at night.

1025
01:06:16,014 --> 01:06:19,141
Man, I'd hear 'em
through the door.

1026
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:27,274
Oh, she didn't tell you
about that, huh?

1027
01:06:28,485 --> 01:06:29,652
Huh.

1028
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:32,821
Well, I guess she wanted
to take that one to the grave.

1029
01:06:36,326 --> 01:06:38,202
She told me
her father was dead.

1030
01:06:40,872 --> 01:06:43,916
No, Wiley's father's dead.

1031
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:00,766
Hey.

1032
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:03,018
Want some company
in there?

1033
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:05,020
Not tonight.

1034
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:12,444
Hey, Wiley, stop it.

1035
01:07:18,576 --> 01:07:20,369
You gonna leave me, Mary?

1036
01:07:22,372 --> 01:07:24,039
Is that what you're planning?

1037
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:32,381
You ungrateful bitch.

1038
01:07:34,217 --> 01:07:36,427
What are you doing,
fucking the French guy, too?

1039
01:07:36,594 --> 01:07:38,137
- Huh?
- Wiley, I don't fucking--

1040
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:39,388
You fucking cunt!

1041
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:42,224
You're making
a fucking jerk outta me.

1042
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:46,395
You son of a bitch!

1043
01:07:46,563 --> 01:07:49,815
You bastard!

1044
01:07:49,983 --> 01:07:51,316
You motherfucking bastard!

1045
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:53,819
I was playing.
It was a game!

1046
01:07:55,655 --> 01:07:57,740
I swear, Mary.

1047
01:08:09,669 --> 01:08:12,129
You know what?
I'm gonna kill this fucking Rooster.

1048
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:20,220
You gotta find him first.

1049
01:08:31,983 --> 01:08:33,817
You know, I did have a plan
to protect my sister.

1050
01:08:33,985 --> 01:08:35,736
I wasn't just doing nothing,
you know.

1051
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:39,865
It just got fucked up,
that's all.

1052
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:44,453
Yeah, a little fucked up.

1053
01:08:47,624 --> 01:08:49,208
We were just kids,
you know?

1054
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:50,876
Just kids.

1055
01:08:53,171 --> 01:08:55,881
Wiley's old man
bragged to Wiley

1056
01:08:56,049 --> 01:08:58,342
how he had all this money
in his desk.

1057
01:08:58,510 --> 01:09:00,844
That he could
fuck around with

1058
01:09:01,012 --> 01:09:03,305
more than Wiley'd
ever make in his life.

1059
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:07,226
And Wiley
knew where the key was.

1060
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:12,856
So I got this great idea.

1061
01:09:13,024 --> 01:09:15,108
We'd rob the fucker.
It was a way for Wiley

1062
01:09:15,276 --> 01:09:17,820
to get back at his old man.

1063
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:22,032
And me?
I'd--

1064
01:09:23,827 --> 01:09:25,661
I'd help Susan,
I'd go to Rooster, I'd say,

1065
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:27,996
"Here, take the money.
Just get the hell outta here.

1066
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:29,832
Leave us alone."

1067
01:09:31,626 --> 01:09:33,502
I said to Wiley, I said,
"Come on. Let's do this."

1068
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:35,504
He said, "No."

1069
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:39,258
And then I told him.

1070
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:42,177
I told him what Rooster
was doing to Sus'.

1071
01:09:45,515 --> 01:09:47,558
And he just...

1072
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:49,393
gave me the key.

1073
01:09:54,566 --> 01:09:55,649
Then he told me--
told me-- he said,

1074
01:09:55,817 --> 01:09:57,818
"I'll call you when my old man
isn't home," you know?

1075
01:09:57,986 --> 01:10:01,363
And he called me and I went over
and the key unlocked the drawer

1076
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:03,407
and I had the money and...

1077
01:10:06,536 --> 01:10:08,871
and I look up and there's
fucking Cabot Reed...

1078
01:10:11,541 --> 01:10:14,501
standing there with a gun,

1079
01:10:14,669 --> 01:10:15,878
looking at me.

1080
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,922
He was heading toward the desk,
"I'm gonna call the police,"

1081
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:20,883
so I just charged at him.
I went at him.

1082
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:22,342
Boom-- he went like this.

1083
01:10:22,510 --> 01:10:24,052
Bang, the fucking gun went off,

1084
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,138
he went down...

1085
01:10:28,391 --> 01:10:30,601
and I saw blood and I, uh...

1086
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:33,812
just got the hell outta there.

1087
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:38,233
I didn't even remember
taking the money.

1088
01:10:41,112 --> 01:10:42,821
So I buried it...

1089
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:47,576
and I just waited for them
to come get me.

1090
01:10:50,204 --> 01:10:52,122
You killed Wiley's father?

1091
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:54,207
Yeah.

1092
01:10:56,586 --> 01:10:58,462
I did.

1093
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:01,298
But they thought, uh...

1094
01:11:01,466 --> 01:11:02,925
they thought Rooster did it.

1095
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:06,428
- Why?
- Ah, there was an eyewitness.

1096
01:11:07,889 --> 01:11:09,348
Who was it?

1097
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:11,642
Wiley.

1098
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:15,437
He told 'em that he saw Rooster
running out of the back...

1099
01:11:15,605 --> 01:11:17,439
after he heard the shot.

1100
01:11:19,442 --> 01:11:22,861
That was a lie, but who the fuck
they gonna believe?

1101
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:29,409
Why Wiley lie
to the policeman?

1102
01:11:29,577 --> 01:11:31,328
Why?

1103
01:11:34,332 --> 01:11:36,291
'Cause he's smart,
I don't know.

1104
01:11:37,627 --> 01:11:39,127
We don't, uh--

1105
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:41,588
we don't talk
about that night.

1106
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:02,150
Aw, Jack, I'm sorry.

1107
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:04,152
Mom, I wanna
go to sleep.

1108
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,612
I know, sweetie.

1109
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:07,739
- Jack, please.
- I'm sorry, come in.

1110
01:12:07,907 --> 01:12:10,075
Come in.
Come, Marty, come in.

1111
01:12:10,243 --> 01:12:11,952
Come on.

1112
01:12:15,123 --> 01:12:17,165
Right down here.

1113
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:19,918
You'll get warm
in a second, okay?

1114
01:12:20,086 --> 01:12:21,336
Oh, God.

1115
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:24,589
What you doing
around so late?

1116
01:12:24,757 --> 01:12:27,259
Come here.
You warm up, okay?

1117
01:12:27,427 --> 01:12:28,927
I need to speak to Bailey.

1118
01:12:29,095 --> 01:12:31,013
- Is he here?
- Yes, Bailey's here, yes.

1119
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:32,264
Sleeping.

1120
01:12:32,432 --> 01:12:34,266
I went out all night drinking.

1121
01:12:34,434 --> 01:12:37,394
I can try to wake him up,
you know?

1122
01:12:37,562 --> 01:12:40,397
- No, no, no.
- No? Okay.

1123
01:12:40,565 --> 01:12:41,690
Well, come.

1124
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:43,650
Come, I make you tea,
coffee, something.

1125
01:12:43,818 --> 01:12:45,110
Come.
Come here.

1126
01:12:50,658 --> 01:12:52,659
Wiley's out of control.

1127
01:12:56,539 --> 01:12:59,166
He's so full
of hate and drugs.

1128
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:05,380
I feel responsible,
in some awful way.

1129
01:13:10,511 --> 01:13:12,220
And it hurts, you know?

1130
01:13:14,557 --> 01:13:16,892
Wiley was a man
I was proud of.

1131
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:21,772
Now he scares me
to death.

1132
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:25,484
You'll be safe here.

1133
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:29,571
No.

1134
01:13:30,573 --> 01:13:33,158
No, if I stay here,
it won't be safe for Bailey.

1135
01:13:33,326 --> 01:13:36,161
Why, what about
Bailey now?

1136
01:13:38,706 --> 01:13:40,749
It's complicated.

1137
01:13:50,968 --> 01:13:53,845
Bailey did something terrible
when we were all kids.

1138
01:13:54,013 --> 01:13:56,098
Wiley covered for him.

1139
01:13:59,018 --> 01:14:01,770
Bailey was trying
to protect Susan.

1140
01:14:01,938 --> 01:14:04,439
You know, he couldn't.

1141
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:10,112
So, Wiley was the hero, huh?

1142
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:11,947
Yeah.

1143
01:14:13,491 --> 01:14:15,617
And the hero
gets the girl, right?

1144
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:24,668
I thought it'd be okay,
you know?

1145
01:14:28,131 --> 01:14:31,383
I told myself
I loved Wiley, but...

1146
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:34,136
the truth is...

1147
01:14:38,099 --> 01:14:39,808
Go.

1148
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:42,644
Go to Bailey.

1149
01:14:42,812 --> 01:14:45,647
I will be here.
Don't worry.

1150
01:14:45,815 --> 01:14:47,816
How you say?
The dog who...

1151
01:14:47,984 --> 01:14:49,985
watches, takes care?

1152
01:14:51,362 --> 01:14:53,280
The watch dog.

1153
01:14:53,447 --> 01:14:55,115
Watch dog.

1154
01:14:56,951 --> 01:14:59,327
Thank you.

1155
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:00,954
Good night.

1156
01:15:01,122 --> 01:15:02,414
Okay.

1157
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:51,129
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

1158
01:15:51,297 --> 01:15:52,547
Yeah, bullshit.
Where are they?

1159
01:15:52,715 --> 01:15:55,634
Whoa, what are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?

1160
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:58,053
I have your money.

1161
01:15:58,221 --> 01:15:59,387
What money?

1162
01:16:02,725 --> 01:16:04,351
Okay...

1163
01:16:06,354 --> 01:16:08,772
$500 for this week,

1164
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:11,983
and $500 in advance.

1165
01:16:12,151 --> 01:16:13,235
Is okay?

1166
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:15,237
Huh?

1167
01:16:16,656 --> 01:16:18,657
Yeah, okay.

1168
01:16:18,824 --> 01:16:20,533
Bailey's not here.

1169
01:16:20,701 --> 01:16:22,827
We had a fight.

1170
01:16:22,995 --> 01:16:25,789
He's probably ran away
in some bar, drinking

1171
01:16:25,957 --> 01:16:27,207
and...

1172
01:16:27,375 --> 01:16:29,960
this moment probably is, like,
how you say, plastered?

1173
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:31,920
Yeah.

1174
01:16:32,088 --> 01:16:34,047
Yeah, Bailey's shit-faced
in his beer again, huh?

1175
01:16:34,215 --> 01:16:35,632
Yeah.

1176
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:39,427
What'd you fight about?

1177
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:41,763
Money.

1178
01:16:41,931 --> 01:16:43,598
He didn't want to pay you.

1179
01:16:43,766 --> 01:16:46,685
I know how business works.

1180
01:16:46,852 --> 01:16:49,396
- You do?
- Mm-hmm.

1181
01:16:49,563 --> 01:16:51,273
How does it work,
Napoleon?

1182
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:54,234
You do what you have to do.

1183
01:16:56,487 --> 01:16:57,821
Yeah, I like that.

1184
01:16:59,949 --> 01:17:02,617
What do you say
we go find your friend Bailey?

1185
01:17:02,785 --> 01:17:05,161
I have a better idea.

1186
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:48,830
You're awake.

1187
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:51,249
Am I?

1188
01:17:55,463 --> 01:17:56,796
Why are you guys here?

1189
01:18:00,634 --> 01:18:03,178
Wiley went crazy tonight.

1190
01:18:05,014 --> 01:18:06,306
Are you all right?

1191
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:11,519
He can still hurt you.

1192
01:18:13,856 --> 01:18:15,774
What are you talking about?

1193
01:18:20,821 --> 01:18:24,699
I know about Rooster
and Susan and Cabot Reed.

1194
01:18:26,702 --> 01:18:28,703
Wiley told me everything.

1195
01:18:35,669 --> 01:18:36,878
When?

1196
01:18:37,046 --> 01:18:39,339
Right after it happened.

1197
01:18:46,931 --> 01:18:48,598
I'm sorry.

1198
01:18:51,268 --> 01:18:53,103
I fucked up so bad.

1199
01:19:10,413 --> 01:19:12,122
Nice house.

1200
01:19:14,458 --> 01:19:16,835
Yeah, Cabott really
knew how to live, didn't he?

1201
01:19:51,704 --> 01:19:53,621
Whew.

1202
01:19:57,376 --> 01:20:00,170
Your father
liked to read, huh?

1203
01:20:02,214 --> 01:20:04,257
You know, you're lucky.

1204
01:20:04,425 --> 01:20:05,800
- I'm lucky?
- Yeah.

1205
01:20:05,968 --> 01:20:07,552
He left you...

1206
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:09,929
all these beautiful books.

1207
01:20:13,392 --> 01:20:15,018
You know what
my father left me?

1208
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:17,854
Insults and abuse.

1209
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:22,150
That's all he ever gave me,
and my mother.

1210
01:20:24,278 --> 01:20:26,154
Till he made her
drink herself to death.

1211
01:20:27,323 --> 01:20:29,699
And she left me alone
in this fucking house.

1212
01:20:45,508 --> 01:20:48,259
So Bailey did you a favor, huh?

1213
01:20:50,471 --> 01:20:52,180
What are you talking about?

1214
01:20:53,265 --> 01:20:55,600
He told me.
He killed your father.

1215
01:20:57,186 --> 01:20:58,520
Yes?

1216
01:21:03,817 --> 01:21:04,943
Fucking Bailey.

1217
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:07,195
He was so scared
when the gun went off,

1218
01:21:07,363 --> 01:21:09,531
he pissed his pants
running for his life.

1219
01:21:20,543 --> 01:21:22,210
He only grazed him.

1220
01:21:27,466 --> 01:21:29,884
I heard the gunshot
from upstairs.

1221
01:21:34,223 --> 01:21:35,932
When I came down,
I found him here.

1222
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:38,309
He was holding
his handkerchief to his head.

1223
01:21:47,945 --> 01:21:50,488
I tried to help him,
you know?

1224
01:21:53,409 --> 01:21:55,410
And he just shoved me away.

1225
01:21:59,081 --> 01:22:00,707
You know
what he said to me?

1226
01:22:03,377 --> 01:22:05,503
He said, "You think
I wouldn't figure it out?

1227
01:22:08,465 --> 01:22:10,592
You can't do anything
on your own.

1228
01:22:13,596 --> 01:22:15,096
You can't even
steal my money.

1229
01:22:17,683 --> 01:22:20,935
You had to send your friend Bailey in
to do a man's job.

1230
01:22:22,563 --> 01:22:24,272
Pathetic loser."

1231
01:22:30,446 --> 01:22:32,113
I told him I just--

1232
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:36,075
I told him
to shut the fuck up,

1233
01:22:37,661 --> 01:22:38,953
but he kept it up.

1234
01:22:39,121 --> 01:22:41,289
He said he was--

1235
01:22:41,457 --> 01:22:44,751
he was gonna call the police,
he was gonna have us both locked up.

1236
01:22:51,425 --> 01:22:53,134
I grabbed the gun.

1237
01:22:57,806 --> 01:22:59,974
I just-- I just--

1238
01:23:01,602 --> 01:23:08,733
I just wanted him to stop.

1239
01:23:13,322 --> 01:23:15,907
Fucking prick.

1240
01:23:19,745 --> 01:23:22,497
He said, "How are you
gonna shoot a goddamn gun?

1241
01:23:24,667 --> 01:23:27,794
A sorry fuck like you
with no balls?

1242
01:23:30,214 --> 01:23:32,840
How you gonna stand up
and take what's yours?"

1243
01:23:48,023 --> 01:23:49,232
I told him...

1244
01:23:50,567 --> 01:23:53,069
"By squeezing
the trigger, Dad.

1245
01:23:57,908 --> 01:23:59,325
That's how."

1246
01:24:15,384 --> 01:24:17,218
You killed your father?

1247
01:24:22,099 --> 01:24:23,641
Yeah.

1248
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:33,735
The meek shall
inherit the Earth, right?

1249
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:40,241
And Cabott Reed's fortune.

1250
01:24:44,663 --> 01:24:46,748
The only trouble is, I...

1251
01:24:49,251 --> 01:24:51,669
kinda run it into
the ground, you know?

1252
01:25:21,366 --> 01:25:22,992
Maybe you need a partner.

1253
01:25:24,953 --> 01:25:26,829
To run the business.

1254
01:26:19,675 --> 01:26:21,175
Wake up, come on.

1255
01:26:21,343 --> 01:26:22,385
Are you listening
to me, Bailey?

1256
01:26:22,553 --> 01:26:24,554
Yep, what's going on?

1257
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:30,101
Will you be able to drive?

1258
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:33,688
Yes.

1259
01:26:35,023 --> 01:26:37,233
- What's going on?
- You are leaving.

1260
01:26:37,401 --> 01:26:38,526
Oh, I'm leaving.

1261
01:26:38,694 --> 01:26:40,194
It's not that simple.

1262
01:26:40,362 --> 01:26:42,655
You sit behind the wheels,
and you just drive away.

1263
01:26:42,823 --> 01:26:43,990
Simple.

1264
01:26:44,157 --> 01:26:45,533
Oh, "just drive away."

1265
01:26:45,701 --> 01:26:47,869
Yes.

1266
01:26:49,288 --> 01:26:51,080
And what do I do for money?

1267
01:26:59,089 --> 01:27:00,965
Okay.

1268
01:27:01,133 --> 01:27:02,508
Take that.

1269
01:27:02,676 --> 01:27:03,885
It's for you.

1270
01:27:20,652 --> 01:27:23,070
I don't know if you're a good guy
or a fuckin' con artist.

1271
01:27:30,579 --> 01:27:32,455
I don't get you.

1272
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:36,792
You're free.

1273
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,753
You can go.

1274
01:27:42,382 --> 01:27:44,008
And what about Wiley?

1275
01:27:44,176 --> 01:27:45,760
Don't worry about Wiley.

1276
01:27:45,928 --> 01:27:47,178
I will take care of him.

1277
01:27:47,346 --> 01:27:50,640
Trust me, you can go.

1278
01:28:51,576 --> 01:28:53,160
Dear Bailey...

1279
01:28:53,328 --> 01:28:56,122
I'm so sorry
for not saying good-bye.

1280
01:28:56,289 --> 01:28:58,666
You've been such
a good brother.

1281
01:28:58,834 --> 01:29:01,460
How could I tell you
I was dying?

1282
01:29:01,628 --> 01:29:03,337
I got this skin cancer.

1283
01:29:03,505 --> 01:29:06,757
I think all those summers
we spent on that crummy beach

1284
01:29:06,925 --> 01:29:08,592
are to blame.

1285
01:29:21,857 --> 01:29:23,024
But...

1286
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:26,152
I didn't want to stay home
and cry about it.

1287
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:29,572
I needed to get away
and see some of this world.

1288
01:29:31,742 --> 01:29:33,743
I'm in Paris.

1289
01:29:33,910 --> 01:29:35,036
I'm in love,

1290
01:29:35,203 --> 01:29:39,040
and I'm living for both of us.

1291
01:29:42,419 --> 01:29:44,378
Please be happy, Bailey.
