00:00:07,659 --> 00:00:08,688
(piercing sound)

00:00:08,689 --> 00:00:11,189
(folk music)

00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:25,980
- You ready?

00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:27,809
- [Man] Yeah.

00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:28,810
- Twice a day.

00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,077
- [Police] Today's your lucky day.

00:00:33,148 --> 00:00:36,352
(suspenseful music)
(folk music)

00:00:36,353 --> 00:00:37,431
(man speaking in foreign language)

00:00:37,432 --> 00:00:42,432
(suspenseful music)
(folk music)

00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:45,605
(dramatic music)
(man panting)

00:00:45,606 --> 00:00:47,106
(folk music)

00:00:47,107 --> 00:00:48,435
(man gasping)

00:00:48,436 --> 00:00:50,135
(folk music)

00:00:50,136 --> 00:00:52,309
(man panting)

00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,727
(folk music)

00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,581
(footsteps pounding)

00:01:01,582 --> 00:01:02,732
(man grunting)

00:01:02,733 --> 00:01:04,143
(bells tolling)

00:01:04,144 --> 00:01:06,561
(folk music)

00:01:11,594 --> 00:01:14,641
(man panting)

00:01:14,642 --> 00:01:18,348
(explosion booming)

00:01:18,349 --> 00:01:20,766
(folk music)

00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,520
- Things started out pretty good.

00:01:27,604 --> 00:01:28,804
It was great to be free.

00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:31,070
I had new job.

00:01:33,603 --> 00:01:34,436
Morning, Miss.

00:01:34,437 --> 00:01:36,599
- Anybody change the sheets?

00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,600
- Yes, I believe so.

00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,723
Good day, sir.

00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:42,729
(folk music)

00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,330
I could manage all right, there.

00:01:45,402 --> 00:01:47,633
(phone ringing)
I enjoyed being around people.

00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,400
El Cortez Hotel, Manny speaking.

00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,503
It takes so little really, to help.

00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,339
- Looks like you're cooking up a storm.

00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,757
(folk music)

00:02:04,605 --> 00:02:07,749
(train whistling)

00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,500
(train rattling)

00:02:15,558 --> 00:02:20,558
(bells chiming)
(folk music)

00:02:25,787 --> 00:02:28,009
- Hey, Pop!
- He's the one.

00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:28,843
- Get 'em.

00:02:28,844 --> 00:02:30,226
(folk music)

00:02:30,227 --> 00:02:31,939
- Hey!
(guys yelling)

00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,149
- You sons of bitches. (yelling)

00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,334
(man grunting)
(men yelling)

00:02:36,335 --> 00:02:37,168
- Hey!

00:02:37,169 --> 00:02:41,748
(man grunting)
(men yelling)

00:02:41,749 --> 00:02:43,416
- Let's go, fuckers!

00:02:46,195 --> 00:02:47,899
- Are you okay, sir?

00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,100
- I'm fucking miserable.

00:02:55,692 --> 00:02:56,630
- That doesn't seem equitable.

00:02:56,631 --> 00:02:59,069
- Damn straight, I gave my fucking legs.

00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,270
What are they giving up?

00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,310
Thanks for your help.

00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,849
If I was to show you something,

00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:09,943
could you keep it quiet?
(suspenseful music)

00:03:11,161 --> 00:03:13,149
- Now, I don't want any trouble.

00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,883
- Ever seen gold before?
(pensive music)

00:03:19,716 --> 00:03:21,859
(door closes)

00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,770
- That's it?

00:03:22,771 --> 00:03:24,809
- Go ahead, it won't bite.

00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,610
I own a fucking mountain full of it.

00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:30,239
There's more gold per
ounce of ore in that rock

00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,039
than any mine in the last century.

00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,849
- That must be one heck of a mine.

00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,119
- Never used any dynamite?

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,953
- No, I never have.

00:03:35,954 --> 00:03:37,939
- Half the fucking
mountain came down on me.

00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,869
Had to crawl a mile through
an air shaft just to get out.

00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,909
- That's a hell of a story.

00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,869
- You think I'm lying?

00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:45,870
- No, sir.

00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,803
- (laughing) There it is.

00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,449
The Dutchman Mine.

00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,459
- That's it?
- Whole thing is full of gold.

00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,329
All I gotta do is get it out of there.

00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,519
- Ah ha.
- That's what I'm doing here.

00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,589
I'm trying to raise enough capital

00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,040
to get back there and get it.

00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,349
- [Manny] I see.

00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,909
You think you'd have some interest?

00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,223
- I'm not giving it away.

00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,049
I gave my legs.

00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,693
You want something from me,
you gotta give me something.

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,400
- It's only fair.

00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,440
- That's just stuff dreams are made of.

00:04:18,441 --> 00:04:19,936
(folk music)

00:04:19,937 --> 00:04:21,187
Hmm.
- That's only fair.

00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,129
That's exactly right, that's correct.

00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:28,207
Depends on how, depends
on how you see things.

00:04:30,091 --> 00:04:31,696
You give something, you get something.

00:04:31,697 --> 00:04:35,329
- Hey, who are you talking to? (laughing)

00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:36,401
- Excuse me?

00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:38,282
- You were talking to yourself.

00:04:38,283 --> 00:04:39,743
- How can I help you today?

00:04:40,855 --> 00:04:42,879
- How can you help me today?

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,830
By giving me a room?

00:04:43,831 --> 00:04:44,889
This is a hotel, right?

00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,449
You got rooms?

00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:47,879
- And how long will you be staying?

00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,713
- What is this?

00:04:48,713 --> 00:04:49,546
The quiz hotel.

00:04:49,547 --> 00:04:50,719
I gotta answer questions.

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,589
- I only asked how long you'd...

00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,286
- However the fuck long, I want.

00:04:54,287 --> 00:04:55,969
(bell chimes)
That is the correct answer.

00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,320
Now, what is your job here?

00:04:58,850 --> 00:04:59,801
- My job?

00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:00,634
(bell chimes)
- That's the wrong answer.

00:05:00,635 --> 00:05:03,029
See the correct answer
is to help the customer.

00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,039
Me, being the customer,

00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,040
I would like a room.

00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,713
Your best room.

00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,118
- And how will you be paying?

00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:15,454
(man laughing)

00:05:15,455 --> 00:05:20,455
(bell chimes)
(yells) Okay!

00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,719
- Okay.

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,722
- Could you get somebody
to get that shit for me?

00:05:25,723 --> 00:05:27,423
'Cause I got some shit I gotta do.

00:05:28,476 --> 00:05:29,976
- Let's go upstairs...
- Sir?

00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,239
I'd like to correct this
slight misunderstanding.

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,101
I was not talking to myself.

00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:39,239
- Yeah, well, you know we're
kind of in a hurry right now,

00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,080
but maybe later you can tell me

00:05:41,081 --> 00:05:43,031
about your invisible friend, all right?

00:05:44,707 --> 00:05:47,719
(folk music)

00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,053
- Sir, there's no smoking in the elevator.

00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,293
Like I say, I got along
with everybody, pretty good.

00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,869
You'd have to put up with
the usual abuse now and then,

00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,720
but that was something I was used to.

00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,583
I enjoy being of service to people.

00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,893
It takes so little, really, to help.

00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,209
How can I be of service?

00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,060
- You can start by saying hello, man.

00:06:15,998 --> 00:06:18,209
(suspenseful music)

00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,759
- Hello?

00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,719
- How you been?
(suspenseful music)

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,899
- All right, pretty good, just working.

00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,550
- I heard from the guys you were.

00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,930
So this looks pretty good for you.

00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,669
- It is.
(folk music)

00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:34,670
- May I, um?

00:06:37,116 --> 00:06:39,616
(folk music)

00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,995
- You're not here to?
- Tell them?

00:06:57,996 --> 00:06:59,279
No, no, no.

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,609
Men should have a second chance.

00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:01,899
Don't you think?

00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,550
A chance to correct his mistakes?

00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,359
- Yes, yes, I do.

00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,549
- Well, that's why I'm here. (fist knocks)

00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,709
Opportunity knocks.

00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,376
I'm here because there's
someone staying here.

00:07:12,377 --> 00:07:13,429
- You're not asking me?

00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,593
- To keep an eye.

00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,213
- That isn't right.

00:07:17,214 --> 00:07:18,779
What people do is their own business.

00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,730
- Absolutely.

00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:21,199
No argument there.

00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,969
Unless they might hurt somebody.

00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:25,449
Then, then it's other people's business.

00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,629
- I'm not comfortable
doing something like that.

00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,983
- It's all right, Manford.

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,809
Guy's name is Jack.

00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:32,810
Jack Clay.

00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,413
I like to know who comes and goes.

00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:37,461
(suspenseful music)

00:07:37,462 --> 00:07:39,599
(telephone ringing)

00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,910
- Wait a minute, please.

00:07:43,303 --> 00:07:48,303
(telephone ringing)
(suspenseful music)

00:08:01,784 --> 00:08:04,034
Front desk, Manny speaking.

00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,329
- Shh, good.

00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,706
Look, the toilet's been running all night

00:08:09,707 --> 00:08:10,540
and it's bothering her.

00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:11,723
Can you check it out?

00:08:13,396 --> 00:08:16,479
(pensive folk music)

00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,830
What?

00:08:20,628 --> 00:08:22,881
(curious folk music)

00:08:22,882 --> 00:08:24,472
Now, come on, man.

00:08:24,473 --> 00:08:27,369
(curious folk music)

00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,501
Hey, hey, watch this.

00:08:29,502 --> 00:08:31,645
Look at that, you like that?

00:08:31,646 --> 00:08:33,586
You like that, come.

00:08:33,587 --> 00:08:35,705
Give me your hand, come on, put it.

00:08:35,706 --> 00:08:36,789
Come on, man.

00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:41,310
(curious folk music)

00:08:45,188 --> 00:08:47,409
- What are you doing?
- I don't know, but...

00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:50,410
(couple whispering)

00:08:51,421 --> 00:08:56,421
(woman moaning)
(curious music)

00:08:57,416 --> 00:09:02,416
(man whispering)
(woman groaning)

00:09:02,482 --> 00:09:07,482
(folk music)
(couple moaning)

00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:20,443
(loud slapping)
(woman gasping)

00:09:20,444 --> 00:09:21,940
(air whooshing)

00:09:21,941 --> 00:09:24,358
(folk music)

00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,742
(toilet flushes)

00:09:28,743 --> 00:09:32,826
(couple laughing and whispering)

00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,349
Hey!

00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,749
Hey babe, you remember Manny?

00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,339
The guy with the invisible friend?

00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,949
You finish?

00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:47,950
- Yes, it's done.

00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,277
(folk music)

00:09:52,885 --> 00:09:54,009
- Oh yeah.

00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,979
(folk music)

00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,990
Wait a minute, come here.

00:10:01,838 --> 00:10:02,859
No, no, hold on.

00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,797
I gotta give you something.

00:10:03,797 --> 00:10:04,750
- No, it's my job.

00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,583
- No, it's okay.

00:10:05,584 --> 00:10:07,757
Just wait right here, I insist.

00:10:07,758 --> 00:10:09,639
Now, let me see.

00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,740
What could I give you?

00:10:12,586 --> 00:10:14,181
(curious folk music)

00:10:14,182 --> 00:10:15,639
(Jack laughing)

00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,593
Naw. (laughs)

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,879
Listen, let me know if you change mind

00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,069
or maybe you gotta ask
your invisible friend.

00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,173
- Are you making fun of me?

00:10:27,174 --> 00:10:28,007
- Making fun?

00:10:28,007 --> 00:10:28,840
No, man.

00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,673
Come on, man.

00:10:29,674 --> 00:10:30,979
I'm trying to get you to have fun, see.

00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,749
Hands on, make the fun yourself.

00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,809
- Because I don't appreciate it.

00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,479
- Manny, look, it's nothing personal, man.

00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,434
I know you got a lot
on your mind, you know,

00:10:37,435 --> 00:10:38,452
a job like this.
- That's right.

00:10:38,453 --> 00:10:39,749
- All right, okay.

00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,750
So let's be friends,

00:10:45,147 --> 00:10:46,431
(Jack sighs)

00:10:46,432 --> 00:10:49,815
(Jack laughing)

00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,066
- Motherfucker!

00:10:53,606 --> 00:10:54,537
- Oh, baby! (laughs)

00:10:54,538 --> 00:10:56,352
You know what I like.

00:10:56,353 --> 00:10:57,248
(door slams)

00:10:57,249 --> 00:11:01,081
(couple laughing and moaning)

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,533
- She was dynamite wrapped in silk.

00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,273
(elevator dings)

00:11:07,274 --> 00:11:09,119
But I learned my lesson.

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,748
I had been burned before.

00:11:10,749 --> 00:11:13,987
(couple laughing)

00:11:13,988 --> 00:11:18,988
(pensive music)
(bells tolling)

00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,137
(couple faintly talking)

00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:46,749
- You know what?

00:11:48,096 --> 00:11:50,749
You're on my last nerve.

00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,750
See you later.

00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,200
- Hello.

00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:03,770
- Hi.

00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,350
- Excuse me, miss.

00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,929
I wanted to apologize about what happened.

00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,833
- That's okay, don't worry about it.

00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:34,010
- I have a table by the window
if you'd like to join me.

00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,053
- Okay, sure.

00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:45,310
Thanks.

00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,791
- It's a beautiful day, isn't it?

00:12:49,792 --> 00:12:50,792
- Uh huh.

00:12:54,871 --> 00:12:55,871
Thanks.

00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,489
- My name is Manford.

00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:05,490
- Theda.

00:13:06,808 --> 00:13:09,129
- That is a very unusual name.

00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,130
- So is yours.

00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,489
- I find that, generally speaking,

00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,909
those people with unusual names

00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,759
are often unusual themselves.

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,427
(curious music)

00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,949
He's got an unusual name.

00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,399
(curious music)

00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,400
Popcorn.

00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:30,483
And he's also unusual.

00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,303
- Is that so?

00:13:33,304 --> 00:13:34,559
Then, it's too bad.

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,357
- No, there's where you're mistaken.

00:13:40,102 --> 00:13:42,591
He owns a gold mine.

00:13:42,592 --> 00:13:43,927
- Really?

00:13:43,928 --> 00:13:46,593
- Morning.
- He doesn't look it.

00:13:46,594 --> 00:13:50,177
(light instrumental music)

00:13:51,221 --> 00:13:52,861
- [Manny] What does a rich man look like?

00:13:55,891 --> 00:13:58,474
(Theda laughs)

00:14:00,236 --> 00:14:02,903
(light tapping)

00:14:05,732 --> 00:14:06,565
I gotta go.

00:14:06,565 --> 00:14:07,398
- But you haven't eat,
you should eat breakfast.

00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:09,147
It's the most important meal the day.

00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:11,179
- It's okay, I'll get something later.

00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,180
Bye.

00:14:21,693 --> 00:14:25,219
- It looks good.
(pills rattling)

00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,220
Vitamins.

00:14:34,204 --> 00:14:36,347
(loud slapping)
(woman gasping)

00:14:36,348 --> 00:14:41,348
(folk music)
(snake rattling)

00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:00,682
(phone ringing)

00:15:00,683 --> 00:15:02,809
El Cortez Hotel, Manny speaking.

00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:05,919
- [Arnie] Manford, my main man.

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,452
What's happening?

00:15:07,453 --> 00:15:08,286
- [Manny] There's nothing.

00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,591
There's nothing to report.

00:15:09,592 --> 00:15:11,740
- Don't let it get to you, Manford.

00:15:11,741 --> 00:15:15,907
You know how you are
with women. (laughing)

00:15:15,908 --> 00:15:18,325
(folk music)

00:15:19,723 --> 00:15:24,723
(bells tolling)
(banjo music)

00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:40,215
- How you doing?

00:15:40,216 --> 00:15:41,049
- Pretty good.

00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:42,350
- Can I talk to ya a second?

00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,539
- I guess so.

00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,530
I have to get to my desk.

00:15:45,531 --> 00:15:47,209
- No, it'd only take a second, man.

00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,043
It's about Theda.

00:15:48,044 --> 00:15:50,174
Yeah, I saw you guys having
breakfast the other morning.

00:15:50,175 --> 00:15:51,977
What's going on?

00:15:51,978 --> 00:15:53,569
- What's going on?

00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:54,403
- Yeah.

00:15:54,404 --> 00:15:57,009
I mean I saw the way
she was looking at you.

00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:57,843
You know?

00:15:57,844 --> 00:15:59,289
Well, how do you explain that?

00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,839
- I don't know what you're talking about.

00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,390
- I'm talking about you, Manny.

00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,589
Don't try to make the moves
on my girl, all right?

00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,423
- I wasn't.

00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,256
- I know, good.

00:16:08,257 --> 00:16:10,479
So let's keep it that way, all right.

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,819
'Cause I'm going outta town
for a couple days and you know,

00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,769
I don't want nothing to
happen while I'm away, Manny.

00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,309
- I don't think there'll be any problems.

00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,399
- Good.

00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,713
'Cause I know she's got
the hots for you, Manny.

00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:22,870
So just don't.

00:16:23,762 --> 00:16:24,962
You see what I'm asking?

00:16:27,651 --> 00:16:30,401
(light slapping)

00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:35,509
(folk music)

00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,869
- Morning, Margie.
- Hi.

00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:42,459
- All the news is 50 print.
- Thanks, Manny.

00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,706
That's all yours, kiddo.

00:16:44,707 --> 00:16:47,279
- Manny, I gotta ask you a favor.

00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,479
- Yes, sure, of course, what is it?

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,009
- There's going to be a guy
I'm meeting with, an investor.

00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:51,843
- Oh good, good.

00:16:51,843 --> 00:16:52,676
Things are looking up?

00:16:52,677 --> 00:16:53,749
- This guy is fucking loaded.

00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,839
His family owns a casino.

00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,223
He wears so much jewelry, he clanks.

00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,699
But I need your help.

00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,979
The guy's got a problem.

00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,929
He doesn't believe that the samples I got

00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,519
came from the mine.

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,353
- I see.

00:17:06,353 --> 00:17:07,186
- [Popcorn] So, what am I gonna do?

00:17:07,187 --> 00:17:08,516
Take him up there?
- You could do that.

00:17:08,517 --> 00:17:11,326
- Well then he's gonna know where it is.

00:17:11,327 --> 00:17:12,432
- You don't want him to know?

00:17:12,433 --> 00:17:14,416
- Well, what if he decides to screw me

00:17:14,417 --> 00:17:15,809
and state claims for himself?

00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,803
I've don't got the whole mountain staked.

00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:21,009
- I see.
- But if there was a guy...

00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,979
A guy who could say that he was there

00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,290
when I took out the samples, then...

00:17:27,793 --> 00:17:29,019
- I don't know if I could do that.

00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,219
- Sure, you could.

00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,699
You look like a guy who could be a miner.

00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,619
- I mean, I don't know
if I could lie like that.

00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,979
- I understand.

00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,745
What's in it for you?

00:17:37,746 --> 00:17:39,589
Eh, you're going to do this for me.

00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:41,189
What am I going to do for you?

00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,640
- That's not what I meant, I,

00:17:43,841 --> 00:17:44,830
I haven't been to the mine.

00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:45,930
- I'll take you there.

00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,229
- Well.
- There's no harm.

00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,899
He just needs a little encouragement.

00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,039
You know, it's like he's afraid
to get on the roller coaster

00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,679
unless he sees somebody else got on

00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,930
and didn't get hurt, see?

00:17:58,025 --> 00:18:00,775
(pensive music)

00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:07,853
- No, I tell you what.

00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:09,209
I want you to tell him to bring it in.

00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,351
Bring it in to me.

00:18:10,352 --> 00:18:11,185
- Hello, stranger.
- Hey, hold on.

00:18:11,186 --> 00:18:13,389
- Welcome back.

00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,532
Good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:16,366
Thanks for having me.

00:18:16,367 --> 00:18:20,533
(people chattering in background)

00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:23,672
- They're right there.

00:18:23,673 --> 00:18:27,309
(people chattering in background)

00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,310
Sorry.

00:18:30,914 --> 00:18:34,204
- Eh, nature is calling me.

00:18:34,205 --> 00:18:35,788
Will you excuse me?

00:18:37,542 --> 00:18:38,969
What can I do for you?

00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:39,970
- Coca Cola, please.

00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,708
- Follow me.

00:18:42,709 --> 00:18:46,876
(people chattering in background)

00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,190
What's wrong?

00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,749
- I forgot what I was supposed to say.

00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,519
- Manny, I got this guy this close.

00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,734
Just come over to the table.

00:19:03,735 --> 00:19:05,123
- Okay, okay.

00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,859
The results came in today.

00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,727
Thought you'd want to know,

00:19:14,728 --> 00:19:16,889
it looks better than expected.

00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,169
The results came in today.

00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,003
I thought you'd want to know,

00:19:19,004 --> 00:19:20,204
it looks better than expected.

00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:24,163
- Okay, now,

00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,329
this is the best asset, here.

00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:28,218
He's the best.

00:19:28,218 --> 00:19:29,190
- Don't worry, I got my own.

00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:30,023
- Well, that's okay,

00:19:30,024 --> 00:19:31,052
but you want to use
discretion at this point.

00:19:31,053 --> 00:19:33,879
We don't want a stampede.
- Right.

00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,109
- Hi, excuse me.

00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,339
- Hey there, Manny.

00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,409
How are ya?

00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:40,159
- Good, sorry to interrupt.

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,599
- Ah, Carlo Russo, Manny DeSilva.

00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,099
- Pleased to meet you.

00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,100
- Good to meet you.

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,569
- Can I buy you a drink or something?

00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:50,403
- No, thank you.

00:19:50,403 --> 00:19:51,403
I can't stay.

00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,759
The results came in today.

00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,593
I thought you'd want to know,

00:19:56,594 --> 00:19:58,359
it looks better than expected.

00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,193
- Oh, that's good.

00:19:59,194 --> 00:20:00,759
That's excellent news.

00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,760
- I'd really like to get moving on this.

00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,860
I'll call you tomorrow.

00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,860
I've gotta go.

00:20:09,511 --> 00:20:11,473
It was good meeting you.
- Yeah, pleasure.

00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,270
- My partner.

00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,180
- Really?

00:20:19,213 --> 00:20:21,388
- Thanks, that's good.

00:20:21,389 --> 00:20:24,059
- All right, so when can I see the mine?

00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,999
- Carlo, it's gonna take
a half a million in cash

00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,940
to get us going.

00:20:27,941 --> 00:20:29,316
- [Carlo] But you don't
need a whole half million.

00:20:29,317 --> 00:20:31,967
- If you don't take the
risk, you can't make the win.

00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,020
- I wanna see.

00:20:41,152 --> 00:20:44,985
(light tapping on calculator)

00:20:46,394 --> 00:20:47,394
- Hi.

00:20:48,861 --> 00:20:50,444
Am I bothering you?

00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,280
- Not at all.

00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:55,990
How can I help you?

00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,289
- It's cold in my room.

00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:02,540
The heat seems to be off.

00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,879
I was wondering if maybe you could come up

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,380
and check the radiator for me.

00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:09,663
- Well, I suppose.

00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,963
It is pretty slow this time of night.

00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,159
It's not even on.

00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,160
- Funny.

00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:38,830
- I'll have a look.

00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,750
- Did Jack talk to you?

00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:44,430
- Jack?

00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:47,599
- My roommate, Jack.

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,989
- Yes, yes, he told me
he was going out of town.

00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:51,839
Someone turned the valve off.

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,133
- Must have been Jack.

00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,616
He thinks I have a crush on you.

00:21:55,617 --> 00:21:57,699
(object clangs)

00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,983
Did he tell you that?

00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,119
- He might have mentioned it.

00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,849
- He's like that.

00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:05,263
He's extremely jealous.

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,140
I told him that I don't even know you.

00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,460
- That's right.

00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:14,299
I think this is okay, now.

00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,529
- He's just jealous of anybody

00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:17,930
who he thinks has more
on the ball than he does.

00:22:18,808 --> 00:22:21,623
- Well, he must have a
hell of a rough time, then.

00:22:21,624 --> 00:22:24,374
(woman laughing)

00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,649
You're funny.

00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:29,289
I couldn't tell right away.

00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,909
You always looks so serious.

00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:32,869
- I have lots of responsibilities.

00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:33,989
- No kidding, are you married?

00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,503
- No, no.

00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:39,119
- That's where Jack went, to see his wife.

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,120
- [Manny] I see.

00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,983
- He's jealous of me when he's married.

00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,829
- You'll get some heat, now.

00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:49,830
- Good.

00:22:50,854 --> 00:22:53,439
You know, Manny, you're full of surprises

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,349
and you're handy, you're funny.

00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,606
You can't tell just by looking.

00:22:57,607 --> 00:22:59,009
- Can't judge a book by its cover.

00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:03,349
- (laughing) Just like um, Popcorn.

00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:06,099
I mean you'd never tell
he has a gold mine.

00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,019
No, I never should have mentioned that.

00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,379
That really shouldn't be repeated.

00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,350
Oh, mum's the word.

00:23:10,351 --> 00:23:12,239
I was just talking.
- Okay.

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,240
- Thanks.

00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,519
Manny, would you like a drink?

00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,380
- No, I gave up drinking.

00:23:18,381 --> 00:23:19,729
Thanks for asking.

00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,059
- Oh, just a teeny weeny one.

00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,410
- No, really, I gave it up.

00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,350
- Do you have a television in your office?

00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,859
- Yes.

00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,439
- Can I come down and watch the late movie

00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,740
until this place heats up?

00:23:36,642 --> 00:23:39,309
(Theda giggles)

00:23:42,741 --> 00:23:46,135
- [Man On TV] All the things
in which I give myself

00:23:46,136 --> 00:23:48,629
grow big and strong.
- Exactly.

00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,859
Can you see how true that is?

00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,919
- You!

00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,179
You were just like a precision watch,

00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,979
tick tock, tick tock.

00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,813
He's in, Manny.

00:23:56,814 --> 00:23:58,059
Russo is in.

00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,919
You were fucking beautiful.

00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,279
- I was okay?

00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,449
- You were fucking Lawrence Olivier.

00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:05,450
That's talk turkey.

00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,743
(woman talking on TV)

00:24:09,744 --> 00:24:10,744
Hmm.

00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,480
- It's nothing, it's nothing.

00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:19,339
- Now, what I wanna do is
make a square right out front,

00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,199
so you know, I'm a square guy.

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,070
- I know that.

00:24:22,071 --> 00:24:24,520
- What I want to do is
touch you in as a partner.

00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:26,623
- I have to tell you,

00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:29,329
I don't have any money
for that kind of thing.

00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:31,639
- I'm giving you shares,
for what you did tonight.

00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,137
You'd be a partner.

00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,229
(liquid splashes)

00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,230
Passed out.

00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:41,201
- I'd like to think about that.

00:24:41,202 --> 00:24:43,318
- Well, let's talk about it tomorrow.

00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:44,290
- Goodnight.

00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:45,485
- Goodnight, partner.

00:24:45,486 --> 00:24:48,403
(reflective music)

00:24:50,932 --> 00:24:52,817
(elevator dings)

00:24:52,818 --> 00:24:55,818
(light jazzy music)

00:25:05,869 --> 00:25:07,043
(woman moaning)

00:25:07,044 --> 00:25:10,044
(light jazzy music)

00:25:14,566 --> 00:25:19,566
- Stop it.

00:25:21,454 --> 00:25:22,494
Stop it.

00:25:22,495 --> 00:25:25,129
(light jazzy music)

00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:27,130
- That wasn't very nice.

00:25:29,032 --> 00:25:31,838
- You're drunk and you don't
know what you're doing.

00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:32,922
- I'm lonely.

00:25:34,603 --> 00:25:36,114
Everybody keeps leaving me.

00:25:36,115 --> 00:25:37,383
I hate it.

00:25:37,384 --> 00:25:39,617
- Well, that's uh,

00:25:39,618 --> 00:25:40,919
that's the way it is.

00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,682
Sometimes, you just have to get it over.

00:25:43,683 --> 00:25:44,683
- I can't.

00:25:47,968 --> 00:25:50,074
- It's mind over matter.

00:25:50,075 --> 00:25:51,149
You just...

00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,791
(light jazzy music)

00:25:53,792 --> 00:25:55,768
You just have to get used to it.

00:25:55,769 --> 00:25:58,317
(light jazzy music)

00:25:58,318 --> 00:25:59,334
Good night.

00:25:59,335 --> 00:26:02,868
(light jazzy music)

00:26:02,869 --> 00:26:04,781
- Good night, Manny.

00:26:04,782 --> 00:26:07,864
(light jazzy music)

00:26:07,865 --> 00:26:10,448
(door squeals)

00:26:14,754 --> 00:26:17,254
(woman moans)

00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,999
- Ever see one of these?

00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,519
It's a claims, man.

00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,139
This is the mine.

00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,179
- How big is it?

00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,329
- Well, that's my claim.

00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:28,119
This area in gold.

00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,029
See, there's a main shaft there

00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,829
and this is the air shaft.

00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:34,459
See, it branches off, goes
through to the other side.

00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,349
There's a gold vein in there
the size of fucking Texas.

00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:40,109
All we gotta do is get it out of there.

00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:42,049
And you'll love it there, Manny.

00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,313
Deer come down, eat right outta your hand.

00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:46,961
- No kidding?

00:26:46,962 --> 00:26:49,283
- (laughs) There it is.

00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:53,069
- That's your place?
- That's it.

00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:53,973
- Looks pretty good.

00:26:53,974 --> 00:26:55,373
- Yes, it does, doesn't it.?

00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:59,260
I'd like you to be my partner, Manny.

00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,960
50/50.

00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,553
I need somebody I can trust.

00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:11,523
- What would I do?

00:27:11,524 --> 00:27:12,929
What would be my responsibilities?

00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:14,149
- Well, you'd be my legs.

00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:17,159
You'd take guys up there, the
surveyors, the geologists,

00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,849
the investors, you'd show 'em around.

00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:20,799
- I'd like to think about that.

00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,409
- That's all I ask, that you consider it.

00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:24,410
- I'll consider it.

00:27:28,174 --> 00:27:29,291
Where is this, exactly?

00:27:29,292 --> 00:27:30,804
What part of the country?

00:27:30,805 --> 00:27:31,670
(folk music)

00:27:31,671 --> 00:27:34,276
- It's about a hundred miles
straight into the Sierras.

00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:36,777
(folk music)

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,268
- [Manny] I'll consider it.

00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:45,769
(folk music)

00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,750
- Doing a little prospect?
- No.

00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,740
- No, just a book I
picked up for a friend.

00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:00,850
- Lady friend?

00:28:01,537 --> 00:28:02,537
- A friend.

00:28:04,161 --> 00:28:07,099
- 'Cause I know how you
get with the ladies.

00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,603
- No, no, nothing like that.

00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,250
- So what do you got from me?

00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:15,559
- Nothing, he went out of
town for a couple of days.

00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,110
- Did he say where he is going?

00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,813
- To see his wife.

00:28:18,814 --> 00:28:20,213
- He said he was married?

00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,220
- Who else?
- He ain't married.

00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,969
When's he back?

00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:26,970
- I don't know.

00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,439
- Okay, look, as soon as he's back,

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,829
I want you to call me right away.

00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:32,980
The minute you see him.

00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,920
Take this number.

00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,583
It's direct to me, anytime.

00:28:39,933 --> 00:28:40,766
- I don't always know.

00:28:40,767 --> 00:28:42,252
Sometimes, when they come in off my shift-

00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:43,828
- Okay, Manford.

00:28:43,829 --> 00:28:45,420
You get in touch, all right?

00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:49,220
- All right, sure.
- Okay.

00:28:55,071 --> 00:28:57,025
(pills rattling)

00:28:57,026 --> 00:29:00,102
(air whooshing)
(men grunting)

00:29:00,103 --> 00:29:05,103
(bells tolling)
(suspenseful music)

00:29:14,232 --> 00:29:15,791
(elevator dings)

00:29:15,792 --> 00:29:18,292
(folk music)

00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:24,459
- Manny, Manny, we
gotta do a thing, quick.

00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,370
You got five minutes.

00:29:25,371 --> 00:29:27,209
He's on his way over here, now.

00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:28,043
- Who?

00:29:28,044 --> 00:29:30,299
- Russo, the investor, the
guy from the other night.

00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,519
He wants to talk some more.

00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,806
I think this is it.

00:29:32,807 --> 00:29:34,729
But you need to make an appearance.

00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:36,579
- I can't, I'm working.

00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,480
- He's coming up to the room.

00:29:37,481 --> 00:29:38,839
He's gonna be here.

00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,181
- Well, I'll come up with
him when he comes in.

00:29:40,182 --> 00:29:41,699
- No, no, it doesn't look right,

00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,629
if you're a partner and
you're working here.

00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:45,739
He needs to think we don't need his money.

00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,969
I told him you were a high roller.

00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:48,870
- That wasn't right.

00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:50,029
- Come up for five minutes

00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:52,329
and then you make an excuse and leave.

00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:53,330
Oh, shit.

00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:57,390
Go on, go on.

00:30:02,452 --> 00:30:05,202
(elevator dings)

00:30:07,128 --> 00:30:09,628
(door closes)

00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,423
- I had an independent essay
done of your ore samples.

00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,509
I'm convinced you have the
potential for a working mine.

00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,839
- We think so.

00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,659
- Now, Popcorn here has explained to me

00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:51,939
that your original shares are
worth two hundred thousand.

00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:52,940
- Conservatively.

00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,350
- Conservatively?

00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:01,459
Well, at any rate, I'm
prepared to offer you

00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,823
75,000 for your interest.

00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:07,350
- For my interest?

00:31:07,351 --> 00:31:08,900
- He's offering to buy you out.

00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:12,365
- This check isn't even certified.

00:31:12,366 --> 00:31:13,409
I'm sorry, I'm not interested.

00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:15,089
- Oh Manny, don't get insulted.

00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:17,039
Carlo only just suggested it to me.

00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:17,873
It wasn't like I was trying to dump ya.

00:31:17,874 --> 00:31:19,569
- I'm just not interested in selling.

00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:21,219
I have another appointment,
so if you'll excuse.

00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,343
- Whoa, Manny, listen,

00:31:23,586 --> 00:31:26,039
I want you to think about my offer.

00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,679
It's always possible for
reasonable men to work together.

00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,329
- I'd be happy to discuss
this any other time.

00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:32,209
But right now, I really
to you have other things.

00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:33,210
Excuse me.

00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,597
- I'll work on him.

00:31:39,666 --> 00:31:42,954
(elevator dings)
(rock music)

00:31:42,955 --> 00:31:44,622
- You gonna call me.

00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,239
- I had an emergency.

00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,969
He just came in.
- I know.

00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:50,849
I just don't want us getting
off on the wrong foot.

00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:52,339
- He's here now.

00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,233
I just don't like it when
you come in here and-

00:31:54,234 --> 00:31:58,651
(men in background faintly speaking)

00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,779
- Oh no, maybe some Chinese place.

00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,989
There's some place around like that?

00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:09,204
- Chinese, two blocks over.

00:32:09,205 --> 00:32:13,622
(men in background faintly speaking)

00:32:20,726 --> 00:32:21,559
- Now, he's seen you.

00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,009
What if you saw you before
and now it's the second time?

00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:24,119
Now he's gonna know you're a cop.

00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,199
- Don't get all wound up.

00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,553
You shouldn't get wound up.

00:32:29,085 --> 00:32:31,835
(pills rattling)

00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,199
- I'm just trying to get along here.

00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,859
- Well, get along with me, Manford,

00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,919
and everything else will fall in line.

00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,920
Stay in touch.

00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:52,801
(man panting)
(air whooshing)

00:32:52,802 --> 00:32:55,552
(elevator dings)

00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,700
- Shit.

00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:14,029
Who is it?

00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:15,959
- He knows you were in my room.

00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,369
- Well I, what did you tell him?

00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:19,203
- I didn't.

00:33:19,204 --> 00:33:20,649
He knew because of the radiator.

00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:22,399
You can't turn it on without a wrench.

00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,616
- Well, I'll just explain it to him.

00:33:23,617 --> 00:33:25,609
- No, Manny, don't say anything.

00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:26,939
I told him that I borrowed the wrench

00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,449
and I fixed it myself.

00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:30,672
Please, Manny, don't say anything.

00:33:30,673 --> 00:33:33,673
(light jazzy music)

00:33:37,344 --> 00:33:40,094
(elevator dings)

00:33:41,456 --> 00:33:44,129
- (laughing) I guess while the cats away,

00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:46,039
the mice will well play, hey, Manny?

00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,269
- I'm familiar with the expression.

00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,669
- Oh yeah, you familiar with this one?

00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:49,503
If you fuck with me,

00:33:49,504 --> 00:33:51,849
I'm gonna cut off your head
and shit down your neck, Manny.

00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:53,200
You familiar with that one?

00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,279
- I hope you're not threatening me

00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,439
because I really don't like
it when somebody threatens me.

00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,629
- Okay, listen, you fuck with
me and you're fucking dead.

00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:03,336
I'm gonna kill you and
your invisible friend.

00:34:03,337 --> 00:34:05,689
And I definitely don't
want no fucking mental case

00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:06,799
around my girlfriend.

00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,559
And she don't want no fucking loony bin

00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,067
around her, neither.

00:34:14,454 --> 00:34:19,454
- That was uncalled for.
(phone ringing)

00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,860
El Cortez Hotel, Manny speaking.

00:34:24,518 --> 00:34:27,851
(light knocking)
- Come.

00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,269
What was that?

00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:32,683
He offered you $75,000.

00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:35,159
- I didn't think it was a good offer.

00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,899
- Manny, Manny, Manny.

00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,370
When a man offers...

00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,259
Look, it's okay.

00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,999
I patched things over.

00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,940
- Well, that's good.

00:34:44,941 --> 00:34:48,269
- He wants controlling
shares, yours and 10% of mine.

00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:50,273
He's willing to finance everything.

00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:55,079
- I don't think so.

00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,747
(bells tolling)

00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,039
I mean, it is real, isn't it?

00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,940
There is real gold there, isn't there?

00:35:06,705 --> 00:35:08,489
- What the fuck?

00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:09,323
You're right.

00:35:09,324 --> 00:35:11,939
There's more gold there
than all the tea in China.

00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,113
You're fucking right.

00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,319
75 grand is peanuts.

00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,473
You're not as dumb as I look. (laughs)

00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,986
- I'd like to go up there.
- The mine?

00:35:23,987 --> 00:35:25,706
The gold mountain is
under five feet of snow.

00:35:25,707 --> 00:35:27,939
You think it doesn't snow?

00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:30,499
- Well, you know, I mean
when the snow melts.

00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,679
- [Popcorn] It's beautiful there.

00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,339
It's like a dream, Manny.

00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:37,903
Just like a fucking dream.
(folk music)

00:35:51,781 --> 00:35:54,531
(pills rattling)

00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,509
- Hi.

00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:09,833
- Hi.

00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,813
- Oh, I'm starving.

00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,260
Yeah?

00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:19,463
Thanks. (giggles)

00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:23,210
- What happened?

00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,150
- Oh, um.

00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:27,910
Hmm.

00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,213
An accident, ow.

00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:35,093
- You shouldn't let
him treat you that way.

00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:38,099
- I'm okay, really.

00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,514
- Nobody deserves to be treated like that.

00:36:39,515 --> 00:36:41,053
You don't have to put up with that.

00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:45,177
- Manny, you don't understand.

00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,450
Jack helped me a lot.

00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:50,863
My mom, she owned the Mustang Ranch.

00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,389
I was a hostess there

00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:54,943
until she married my stepdad.

00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:57,853
- Your stepdad?
- Hmm, yeah, Harry.

00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:01,303
Harry was a fucker, man.

00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,680
He was always coming on to me.

00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:10,583
Anyway, the feds raided the
ranch and they closed it down.

00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:14,709
Turns out, he was laundering money.

00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:17,360
Now the fuckers doing a four
year stretch at Tonopah.

00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,360
- What about your mom?

00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,260
- She split.

00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,190
Left the country.

00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,997
Jack was a regular so we hooked up.

00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,153
Jack's all right.

00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,383
Just gets a little rough
sometimes, that's all.

00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:42,390
- No.

00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,569
He's going to get himself
in a lot of trouble.

00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:47,570
Won't be long, now.

00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,960
What goes around comes around.

00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:53,980
I believe in that.

00:37:54,819 --> 00:37:56,069
- I don't know.

00:37:57,415 --> 00:37:59,743
(ominous music)
- What the fuck?

00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:01,049
What, Manny?

00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:02,379
What, every time I turn around, what?

00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,666
You get mad at me and I
gotta worry about you-

00:38:03,667 --> 00:38:05,057
- Simmer down, we're just talking.

00:38:05,058 --> 00:38:06,755
- Babe, I told you-
- You fucking her?

00:38:06,756 --> 00:38:07,680
Are you fucking him?

00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,620
- No, I'm not fucking him, baby.

00:38:08,621 --> 00:38:09,772
- You know what, forget
about it, let's go.

00:38:09,773 --> 00:38:11,219
- Calm down.
- Let's go.

00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,674
- Maybe you should go.

00:38:12,675 --> 00:38:13,685
- You know know I think?

00:38:13,686 --> 00:38:15,229
I think you should sit the fuck down!

00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,063
You know why?

00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,129
'Cause I'll vaporize you.

00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,764
- I told you before, I
don't like being threatened.

00:38:18,765 --> 00:38:21,039
- I don't give a fuck what you
told me, you fucking retard.

00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,363
I'll cut your-(loud slicing)

00:38:22,364 --> 00:38:24,985
(Jack yelling)

00:38:24,986 --> 00:38:26,649
- Don't get excited, just stay calm.

00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:29,144
It was an accident.
- You motherfucker!

00:38:29,145 --> 00:38:31,867
(suspenseful music)

00:38:31,868 --> 00:38:33,130
You son of a bitch.

00:38:33,131 --> 00:38:35,149
You stuck me, man,
you're dead motherfucker.

00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,349
- Now, now, that's what
got you in all this trouble

00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:37,240
in the first place.

00:38:37,241 --> 00:38:39,869
- No, I'm gonna send
your ass to fucking jail.

00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:41,779
- Oh, well, we can go together.

00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:42,770
You hit her.

00:38:42,771 --> 00:38:45,299
There's some police being there, come on.

00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,807
- Fuck you, man.

00:38:46,808 --> 00:38:49,089
I'm gonna get you, you son of a bitch.

00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:50,649
I'm gonna get you, motherfucker.

00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:53,650
(suspenseful music)

00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,949
- Don't worry, he won't
be bothering you anymore.

00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:05,383
- What did you do that for?

00:39:06,456 --> 00:39:07,289
- [Manny] What did I?

00:39:07,289 --> 00:39:08,122
- What am I supposed to do now?

00:39:08,123 --> 00:39:09,839
I don't have any money.

00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,140
Where am I supposed to go?

00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,923
- You can stay with me
until you get on your feet.

00:39:17,509 --> 00:39:20,259
(pensive music)

00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,633
- [Arnie] You think you
could get me in his room?

00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,134
- Okay, I'll be on front in five minutes.

00:39:27,135 --> 00:39:29,849
- All right.
- All right.

00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:30,850
Bye.

00:39:32,423 --> 00:39:35,989
(door slams open)

00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:37,703
- Where's my fucking map?

00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:39,773
- What?

00:39:39,774 --> 00:39:41,599
- My map and my samples are gone.

00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,409
Somebody tossed my room.

00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:44,889
- They got the map and the gold?

00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:46,869
- You think you can
fucking screw me like this!

00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:47,889
- I did not steal it.

00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:48,770
I did not steal it.

00:39:48,771 --> 00:39:50,329
- It was you, Manny.

00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:51,399
You're the only one.

00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,259
- Now, if you go on like
that, I'm going to get mad.

00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,449
- It's no good to you, anyway.

00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:56,309
You don't know where the mine is.

00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:59,089
You think I would tell you
exactly where the mine is?

00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:00,129
Do you?

00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:01,010
You don't know.

00:40:01,011 --> 00:40:02,360
You could search for years.

00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,539
- If that's true, then why you're so upset

00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,969
about the map being stolen?

00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,823
- Because I trusted you.

00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,630
- I think it's time we talk to Mr. Russo.

00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,329
- Russo?

00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,369
- You set up a meeting right now.

00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:20,079
I have to take care of something else.

00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,939
And then I'll take care of Mr. Russo.

00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,009
- Now hold on.

00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:24,539
I don't like you saying that.

00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,689
- If Mr. Russo took a map,

00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,745
then Mr. Russo will have to answer to you.

00:40:27,746 --> 00:40:29,297
(light knocking)

00:40:29,298 --> 00:40:34,298
(suspenseful music)
(keys jangling)

00:40:53,864 --> 00:40:55,059
What are you looking for?

00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:57,363
- Dope, smack.

00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:00,815
Just a little trip the other day.

00:41:00,816 --> 00:41:03,949
I think went south and
we made some arrangements

00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:05,400
and he's waiting on delivery.

00:41:11,374 --> 00:41:15,287
He might have stashed it somewhere else.

00:41:15,288 --> 00:41:16,749
The order hadn't arrived yet.

00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:19,591
- Come on, come on, don't.
(suspenseful music)

00:41:19,592 --> 00:41:20,592
Don't make a mess.

00:41:30,386 --> 00:41:33,199
(suspenseful music)

00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,214
- Shit!

00:41:34,215 --> 00:41:36,965
(pensive music)

00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:39,493
Fucking spike.

00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,249
- Better have that looked at.

00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,770
- [Arnie] No shit, Manford!

00:41:43,771 --> 00:41:46,521
(pensive music)

00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,460
- Take the elevator.

00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:08,879
(elevator dings)
- Where is she, Manny?

00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,723
- She, you mean Theda?
- Yeah.

00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:17,193
You know she disappears,
you going with her, right?

00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,111
(blade slings)

00:42:23,112 --> 00:42:24,569
You know what I'm saying?

00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:25,929
Yeah, fuck you, man.

00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:27,969
Two can play that game, motherfucker.

00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:30,149
She disappears, you suspect number one.

00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:32,119
- I really don't know what
you're going on about.

00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,870
(beeper beeping)

00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:39,210
- You will.

00:42:40,365 --> 00:42:43,198
It's your lucky motherfucking day.

00:42:51,331 --> 00:42:52,640
- What the fuck was that?

00:42:52,641 --> 00:42:54,659
I thought the girl disappeared.

00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,299
- He's a junkie.

00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,109
- Look, Manford,

00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:59,899
are you involved with that girl?

00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,889
- No, no, he's just jealous of me.

00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:02,993
- He's jealous of you?

00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,209
Well, if you're involved, why-
- These things can happen.

00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:08,079
- No, not with you, Manford.

00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,080
Not with you.

00:43:10,135 --> 00:43:11,799
Look, I don't want to have to start-

00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:12,790
- Oh, oh, I understand.

00:43:12,791 --> 00:43:14,709
Now, you're threatening me.
- No, no, I'm just pointing-

00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:16,209
- And who was in that
room without a warrant?

00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:18,923
- Look, don't go playing
your fucking head games now!

00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:22,533
- Maybe it's better if

00:43:22,534 --> 00:43:24,783
we just don't have anything
to do with each other.

00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:28,323
- Look, Manford,

00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:31,959
I just don't think you
should be getting involved

00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,639
with somebody.

00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:36,303
You know how you can get,
what that can lead to.

00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:38,850
You remember, Louise?

00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:42,630
- It's nothing.

00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:44,570
- It's nothing.

00:43:45,552 --> 00:43:49,409
- Okay, let's just try
to keep a lid on things.

00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:51,809
And bust this fucker and we'll move on.

00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:52,873
- That's right.

00:43:52,874 --> 00:43:55,541
(pensive music)

00:43:58,312 --> 00:44:01,479
(electric jazz music)

00:44:32,667 --> 00:44:37,084
(faint music and lady talking on TV)

00:44:45,859 --> 00:44:48,059
- Did you see him?

00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,060
- He's at the hotel.

00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:53,930
- What's the matter?

00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:01,530
I think maybe I better be going.

00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:03,860
- No.

00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,413
No, you're not going anywhere.

00:45:05,414 --> 00:45:07,399
- I think I better.

00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,233
- You'll never find it.

00:45:08,234 --> 00:45:10,102
You can search for years
and you'll never find it.

00:45:10,103 --> 00:45:11,289
You'll start looking for it.

00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:12,740
- What are you talking about?

00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:16,110
- The mine.

00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,119
You broke into Pop's room and
you stole the map, didn't you?

00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,120
- No, I didn't.

00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:29,141
I told Jack about it.

00:45:29,142 --> 00:45:30,142
- Jack?

00:45:31,992 --> 00:45:32,856
Is that what this is about?

00:45:32,857 --> 00:45:34,835
You think you can steal a man's dream?

00:45:34,836 --> 00:45:37,123
- (scoff) I mentioned it.

00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:38,853
I just mentioned it.

00:45:38,854 --> 00:45:40,283
You know like you mentioned it.

00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,163
- Well, you know what's
gonna happen now, don't you?

00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:51,069
Jack's going to find the map missing

00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:52,293
from under the mattress.

00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:55,546
And naturally, he's going
to think that you took it

00:45:55,547 --> 00:45:58,547
and he's going to think that
you betrayed and abandoned him.

00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:03,079
Now when he sees that the map is gone,

00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:04,180
what's he going to do?

00:46:09,332 --> 00:46:10,582
- I don't know.

00:46:12,017 --> 00:46:13,423
- But you can imagine?

00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,759
You can imagine, if he
can't control himself,

00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,830
if he gets obsessed...

00:46:24,237 --> 00:46:27,790
- (crying) What are you gonna do?

00:46:27,791 --> 00:46:32,791
(somber music)
(Theda crying)

00:46:42,205 --> 00:46:43,205
- My God.

00:46:45,607 --> 00:46:50,607
(somber music)
(Theda crying)

00:47:02,754 --> 00:47:05,671
(light soft music)

00:47:07,694 --> 00:47:11,068
(Manny sighing)

00:47:11,069 --> 00:47:13,986
(light soft music)

00:47:17,054 --> 00:47:18,558
I want you inside me.

00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:23,559
(light soft music)
(couple breathing heavily)

00:47:28,072 --> 00:47:33,072
(light jazzy music)
(couple panting)

00:47:35,581 --> 00:47:36,675
(Theda squeals)

00:47:36,676 --> 00:47:41,676
(light jazzy music)
(couple panting)

00:47:43,585 --> 00:47:48,585
(couple moaning)
(jazzy music)

00:48:07,425 --> 00:48:10,592
(intense jazzy music)

00:48:22,236 --> 00:48:27,236
(couple breathing heavily)
(jazzy music)

00:49:15,846 --> 00:49:18,946
(pensive music)

00:49:18,947 --> 00:49:21,447
(jazzy music)

00:49:31,595 --> 00:49:32,632
(Theda moans)

00:49:32,633 --> 00:49:35,133
(jazzy music)

00:49:38,117 --> 00:49:40,632
(Theda moans)

00:49:40,633 --> 00:49:41,893
This could get bad.

00:49:43,109 --> 00:49:44,109
You know?

00:49:46,611 --> 00:49:49,461
- No one should go through
their life, scared of someone.

00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:52,750
Don't worry.

00:49:53,802 --> 00:49:55,919
I'm gonna take care of you now.

00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,170
- I've heard that before.

00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:02,883
- You think I would lie to you?

00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,929
- People promise things.

00:50:05,930 --> 00:50:06,930
- Not me.

00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:11,003
If you knew me, you'd know,

00:50:12,598 --> 00:50:13,748
when I say something...

00:50:18,406 --> 00:50:21,073
(lips smacking)

00:50:26,713 --> 00:50:30,880
A man is only as good as
his word or he's nothing.

00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:38,643
- You're my knight and shining armor.

00:50:42,135 --> 00:50:43,973
(loud knocking)

00:50:43,974 --> 00:50:47,682
- Open this door, Manford!
- Okay, okay.

00:50:47,683 --> 00:50:50,156
(loud banging)

00:50:50,157 --> 00:50:52,637
Okay, okay, okay!

00:50:52,638 --> 00:50:54,788
(door slams)
- This ain't no fucking joke!

00:50:58,085 --> 00:51:00,502
(door slams)

00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:09,123
Are you here of your free will?

00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:13,763
Did you consent to come here?

00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:16,309
- Yes, officer.

00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:17,839
- I think you owe us an apology.

00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,669
- Get dressed and come over here, please.

00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:22,573
- I said-
- I fucking heard you!

00:51:22,574 --> 00:51:23,574
Sit down.

00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:38,930
I think we need to clear
the air, a little, here.

00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:45,940
Okay.

00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:50,963
Okay, are you aware that your
boyfriend is dealing heroin?

00:51:54,330 --> 00:51:55,609
- Yes.

00:51:55,610 --> 00:51:57,679
- Are you involved?
- No.

00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:01,103
- Yes, you are involved
'cause you're aware of it.

00:52:03,193 --> 00:52:04,283
- I don't shoot.

00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:07,850
- It's a matter of time.

00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:12,929
I also wanna make you
aware, that Manford here.

00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:15,142
- This isn't right.
- Manford is a-

00:52:15,143 --> 00:52:15,976
- I'm warning you.

00:52:15,977 --> 00:52:17,440
- Fuck, are you threatening me?

00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,029
Are you fucking threatening me!

00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:24,509
- A man has a right to a second chance.

00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:26,209
- Yeah, unless they're
gonna hurt somebody.

00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:27,493
Isn't that right, Manny?

00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:30,710
You remember Louise and
Frank, don't you, huh?

00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:34,010
Yeah.

00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:38,650
You see,

00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:43,993
Manny here is a recent
graduate of the nut house.

00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:48,253
Are you also aware, why he was in?

00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:54,649
'Cause Manny's a very jealous man.

00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:55,483
- This isn't right.

00:52:55,484 --> 00:52:57,362
- Listen, asshole!

00:52:57,363 --> 00:52:59,529
I never bought that
temporarily insane shit

00:52:59,530 --> 00:53:00,952
when I busted you the first time.

00:53:00,953 --> 00:53:02,969
It's fucking bullshit.

00:53:02,970 --> 00:53:04,329
You can pull the shrinks in the straights,

00:53:04,330 --> 00:53:08,019
but I know (scoffs), you
weren't temporarily insane.

00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:10,320
'Cause with you, it's a
full time fucking job.

00:53:14,157 --> 00:53:16,907
(Manny coughing)

00:53:21,518 --> 00:53:23,089
- [Manny] Now look, you've
gone and scared her.

00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:25,009
- Yeah, well that's the
whole point, Manford,

00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:27,323
because people should know about you.

00:53:28,365 --> 00:53:29,365
And you,

00:53:30,342 --> 00:53:32,809
I'mma forget about this whole thing.

00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:34,209
'Cause you're gonna help
me bust your boyfriend.

00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:35,839
You got that?

00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,239
And this is how it's gonna go down.

00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,719
When your boyfriend gets his delivery,

00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,299
you're gonna call Manny at the front desk.

00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:44,613
Excuse me, I can't hear you.

00:53:45,891 --> 00:53:47,326
- All right.

00:53:47,327 --> 00:53:49,489
- And Manford, you're
gonna put that phone book

00:53:49,490 --> 00:53:50,490
on the front desk

00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:52,649
and I'm gonna be ready across the street,

00:53:52,650 --> 00:53:54,171
watching up both of you.

00:53:54,172 --> 00:53:55,923
- All right.

00:53:55,924 --> 00:53:57,889
- And as soon as it's all over,

00:53:57,890 --> 00:54:00,059
you're gonna get as far away
from that man as you can,

00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:01,079
as fast as you can.

00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:01,913
- That, no-

00:54:01,914 --> 00:54:05,259
- You put a steak knife
through a man's hand, Manford!

00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:07,239
You think that's not
enough to send you back?

00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:09,490
You think that kind of
thing goes unreported?

00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:14,230
Get dressed.

00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:18,505
Sit down.

00:54:18,506 --> 00:54:21,250
(gun clicks)

00:54:21,251 --> 00:54:22,999
You fuck around with me this time,

00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,112
you're going back in the fucking ward.

00:54:25,113 --> 00:54:26,990
Comprendo, Manfredo, hmm?

00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:38,119
Call him.
(Theda scoffs)

00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:39,941
Tell him you want to come back.

00:54:39,942 --> 00:54:43,025
(suspenseful music)

00:54:52,023 --> 00:54:54,773
(car door shuts)

00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:57,619
- If she gets hurt in any way-

00:54:57,620 --> 00:54:58,820
- Or you're gonna, what?

00:55:02,723 --> 00:55:05,473
(pensive music)

00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:08,760
- Where are the other guys?

00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:11,799
- I call 'em when I need 'em.

00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,400
I got guys all over this street.

00:55:16,504 --> 00:55:17,671
What the fuck?

00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:19,763
I can't believe you.

00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:23,670
First thing you do is fall
in love with some douche bag.

00:55:24,870 --> 00:55:26,540
She's playing you, Manny.

00:55:26,541 --> 00:55:27,541
- You don't know.

00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:29,939
She's never had the right guy,

00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:32,469
somebody who meant what they said.

00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:34,179
You don't know.

00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:35,530
- Well, maybe you're right.

00:55:36,410 --> 00:55:38,969
Yeah, maybe you two match up together.

00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:42,400
Like a pair of fucking
nuts on a slot. (laughing)

00:55:42,401 --> 00:55:47,368
Cha ching. (laughing)

00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:51,137
He hadn't left that room.

00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:57,078
Just waiting.

00:55:57,079 --> 00:56:00,572
Doesn't want to miss it when it comes.

00:56:00,573 --> 00:56:02,490
He's just itching, hmm.

00:56:03,662 --> 00:56:05,079
Gonna slide some.

00:56:05,977 --> 00:56:07,060
Test it, hmm.

00:56:09,672 --> 00:56:10,755
Junkie fever.

00:56:14,195 --> 00:56:16,999
Think of it, like you do Theda.

00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,712
Can't get enough, even when you got her.

00:56:19,713 --> 00:56:21,630
Theda's in your blood.

00:56:25,728 --> 00:56:27,561
You dream that, Manny?

00:56:28,508 --> 00:56:29,608
You know what that is?

00:56:31,310 --> 00:56:32,449
You can think things,

00:56:32,450 --> 00:56:35,820
you can see things are real,

00:56:37,609 --> 00:56:39,359
but they're not real.

00:56:40,546 --> 00:56:43,379
Stuff will awaken your nightmares.

00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:48,030
- All right.

00:56:51,739 --> 00:56:53,973
- (scoffs) Okay.

00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:58,010
Okay, let's just handle this
without any more bullshit.

00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:03,490
- I'm nervous.

00:57:05,330 --> 00:57:06,880
- Look, I need you on the desk.

00:57:07,943 --> 00:57:09,029
- No.

00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:11,030
No, something bad could happen in there.

00:57:12,210 --> 00:57:13,210
I need a drink.

00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:18,109
- Okay, you got 10 minutes
before you're due at the desk.

00:57:18,110 --> 00:57:19,110
Go get a drink.

00:57:20,030 --> 00:57:21,030
- Yeah, all right.

00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:26,309
- Hey, put that phone book on the desk

00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:27,503
where I can see you do it.

00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,230
(car door slams)

00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:38,163
- Scotch, please, double.

00:57:39,707 --> 00:57:41,779
(light jazzy music)

00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:43,379
I owe you an apology.

00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:44,623
- Don't plan on staying.

00:57:48,470 --> 00:57:50,263
- I found out who has the map.

00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:55,599
I didn't steal it, but
I did make a mistake.

00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:57,140
I told Theda about it.

00:57:57,141 --> 00:57:59,339
- Theda? (laughs)

00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:00,659
What were you two gonna do?

00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:04,259
Go up there with pick and
shovel, looking for nuggets?

00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:05,399
- I didn't tell her about the map.

00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,350
I mentioned that you owned a gold mine.

00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:10,839
- And now you realize,
you don't know shit.

00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:11,800
You need me.

00:58:11,801 --> 00:58:14,249
Well, fuck you, I don't need a map.

00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:15,250
- Are you done?

00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:17,140
May I continue?

00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:21,929
Her boyfriend broke into
your room and stole the map,

00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:22,763
not her.

00:58:22,764 --> 00:58:24,409
- That jumpy little piece of stink?

00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:26,049
What's he gonna do with it?

00:58:26,050 --> 00:58:27,749
- [Manny] That's why I'm here.

00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:30,199
She told me he has plans.

00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,619
He thinks you have more
gold stashed somewhere.

00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:33,620
- What?

00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:37,559
- I think you should go get the map back

00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,119
and explain it to the dickhead

00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:40,679
before je does something stupid.

00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:42,479
- Oh, that doesn't sound too bright.

00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,769
- Then, call the cops.
- No, no.

00:58:44,770 --> 00:58:45,760
- I'll call them, I'm a partner.

00:58:45,761 --> 00:58:48,560
- I don't want the cops, you
know, then everybody knows.

00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:54,540
- I'm just trying to correct the mistake.

00:58:57,455 --> 00:58:59,955
(Manny sighs)

00:59:02,704 --> 00:59:04,346
(Manny exhales)

00:59:04,347 --> 00:59:07,597
(light pensive music)

00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:15,869
All the news is 50 print, Margie.

00:59:15,870 --> 00:59:16,870
- Thanks, kiddo.

00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:21,380
(elevator dings)

00:59:22,599 --> 00:59:23,599
Good night.

00:59:29,177 --> 00:59:31,773
(phone trilling)
(phone ringing)

00:59:31,774 --> 00:59:33,489
- [Manny] El Cortez Hotel, Manny speaking.

00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:35,809
- Yeah, he just closed the curtain.

00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:37,319
- All right, I have to go
change some light bulbs

00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:38,320
in the hallway.

00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:55,083
I'm gonna have a little
talk with our friend.

00:59:55,084 --> 00:59:56,276
I want you to come with me.

00:59:56,277 --> 00:59:58,089
- Well, you know, he's gonna deny it.

00:59:58,090 --> 00:59:58,923
What if he-

00:59:58,924 --> 01:00:00,399
- I know where it is,
it's under the mattress.

01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,599
Where's your gun?
- What?

01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:02,893
- Your gun, I saw.

01:00:02,894 --> 01:00:03,727
- [Popcorn] What do you want with my gun?

01:00:03,728 --> 01:00:06,519
What are you gonna do with my gun?

01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,789
- If any trouble starts, pull
this out and wave it around.

01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:09,849
He'll pucker up right away.

01:00:09,850 --> 01:00:10,986
- Oh no, wait a minute.

01:00:10,987 --> 01:00:12,039
You can't pull a gun.

01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:13,409
You pull a gun, anything can happen.

01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:14,243
- Nothing will happen.

01:00:14,243 --> 01:00:15,235
It's not even loaded.

01:00:15,236 --> 01:00:16,362
- All right.

01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:17,913
- Let's just get this over with.

01:00:23,385 --> 01:00:25,153
(light knocking)

01:00:25,154 --> 01:00:27,821
(Jack sniffing)

01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:32,509
Excuse us, is Jack in?
- What's this about?

01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:34,213
- We've had some complaints.

01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:39,779
- What the fuck are you doing?

01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:42,849
What I tell you about letting
people in my fucking room?

01:00:42,850 --> 01:00:45,409
You're fucking pushing it.
- Where's the map?

01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:46,243
- What fucking map?

01:00:46,244 --> 01:00:48,459
- The one you stole from Pop's room.

01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:49,889
- What fucking map?

01:00:49,890 --> 01:00:50,723
Listen, you know what?

01:00:50,724 --> 01:00:51,879
If you're on medication,

01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:54,099
then maybe you should go get
your prescription filled.

01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:56,259
- Just give me the map and we'll leave.

01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:57,399
- What are you, two loonies?

01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,019
What are you, roommates
from the funny farm?

01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:00,729
What the fuck is going on?

01:01:00,730 --> 01:01:03,169
- Did you, or did you not
tell Jack about the gold mine?

01:01:03,170 --> 01:01:04,417
- Oh, this is the story?

01:01:04,418 --> 01:01:05,619
- You know I did, he's denying it.

01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:06,686
- Denying, you-

01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:08,019
- Then we'll just
settle, I'll get the map.

01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:08,910
- No, you ain't going nowhere.

01:01:08,911 --> 01:01:11,949
- I wouldn't do that, Pop!
- You fucking nut, what?

01:01:11,950 --> 01:01:13,239
- Oh, this is what I get.

01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:16,659
A fucking cripple, a retard and a cunt.

01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:17,919
- Fuck you.
- No, fuck you!

01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:19,079
- Take a fucking pill and relax.

01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:20,123
- Here's the map.

01:01:21,570 --> 01:01:22,913
- Ha!
- Fucking.

01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:26,352
Give me that, no.
(Popcorn yelling)

01:01:26,353 --> 01:01:27,186
Go, go ahead,

01:01:27,187 --> 01:01:29,369
I'll shoot you in the
back of your fucking head!

01:01:29,370 --> 01:01:30,959
No, leave it.

01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:35,379
I said, leave it!
(Manny grunts)

01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:36,430
What's with this map?

01:01:37,590 --> 01:01:38,635
Now what's with this fucking map?

01:01:38,636 --> 01:01:41,089
- Baby, baby, he owns a fucking gold mine.

01:01:41,090 --> 01:01:42,445
- What?
- That's it.

01:01:42,446 --> 01:01:44,555
- I don't believe this.
- It's for us.

01:01:44,556 --> 01:01:47,579
- (laughing) Manny, my boy,

01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:49,539
they must hooked you
up to the jumper cables

01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:52,009
and left you charging all
night, fucking long, man.

01:01:52,010 --> 01:01:56,018
You fucking retard!
(glass shatters)

01:01:56,019 --> 01:01:58,694
(men grunting)
(Theda squeals)

01:01:58,695 --> 01:02:02,382
- (yells) You fucking, get off of him!

01:02:02,383 --> 01:02:06,045
Get off of him!
(body bangs)

01:02:06,046 --> 01:02:07,417
(loud slapping)
(Theda yells)

01:02:07,418 --> 01:02:08,333
(blade slings)

01:02:08,334 --> 01:02:09,347
(Theda groaning)

01:02:09,348 --> 01:02:11,931
(men grunting)

01:02:13,888 --> 01:02:16,388
(men yelling)

01:02:18,684 --> 01:02:19,853
(air whooshing)

01:02:19,854 --> 01:02:24,854
(body bangs)
(skull cracks)

01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:36,334
Okay.

01:02:37,234 --> 01:02:39,199
Now, I'm gonna take care of this.

01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:40,947
See if he's still there.

01:02:40,948 --> 01:02:42,163
- If who is still there?

01:02:43,984 --> 01:02:46,344
- [Manny] There's a cop across
the street watching the room.

01:02:52,591 --> 01:02:53,999
- He's just sitting there.

01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,150
- I'll take care of it.

01:02:57,710 --> 01:02:59,399
Is there anything else
anybody wants to tell me?

01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,690
Because if there is...

01:03:05,090 --> 01:03:06,090
I understand.

01:03:08,830 --> 01:03:09,663
Pop?

01:03:09,664 --> 01:03:11,493
- Manny, there's the gold there.

01:03:13,711 --> 01:03:15,593
- All right.

01:03:15,594 --> 01:03:17,139
All right, if we just
stick to our stories,

01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:18,519
we'll be just fine.

01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:20,740
Everybody just stay here.

01:03:25,247 --> 01:03:28,580
(Theda lightly sobbing)

01:03:31,783 --> 01:03:36,116
(loud banging)
- Don't fucking move!

01:03:37,530 --> 01:03:38,530
Where is he?

01:03:39,890 --> 01:03:40,890
- He's dead.

01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:56,823
- What the fuck?

01:03:57,718 --> 01:03:59,010
(loud slapping)
(Arnie grunts)

01:03:59,011 --> 01:04:01,428
(body thuds)

01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:05,985
- [Manny] Just stick to the story.

01:04:05,986 --> 01:04:07,449
- [Popcorn] I can't do this, I can't.

01:04:07,450 --> 01:04:10,609
- Just stick to this story and
everything's gonna work out.

01:04:10,610 --> 01:04:11,610
Get your things.

01:04:27,767 --> 01:04:29,659
How you feeling, Arnie?

01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:30,759
- We can figure something out here

01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:32,543
so it don't look so bad for you.

01:04:33,390 --> 01:04:35,548
This kind of shit, you
don't never get away with.

01:04:35,549 --> 01:04:36,382
- What kind of shit is that?

01:04:36,383 --> 01:04:39,259
- I told you, I got guys on the street.

01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:40,929
They saw me come up in here.

01:04:40,930 --> 01:04:43,030
They gonna start worrying right about now.

01:04:44,390 --> 01:04:45,629
- He's got guys on the street.

01:04:45,630 --> 01:04:46,590
Pop, do you believe that?

01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,929
He says he's got guys on the street.

01:04:47,930 --> 01:04:49,949
- That may be.
- Theda?

01:04:49,950 --> 01:04:52,389
- I would've thought
they'd be here by now.

01:04:52,390 --> 01:04:53,223
- [Manny] That's right.

01:04:53,224 --> 01:04:54,409
- They're gonna come through that door

01:04:54,410 --> 01:04:56,510
and they're not gonna be asking questions.

01:04:57,894 --> 01:05:00,038
- Not the way I look at it.

01:05:00,039 --> 01:05:00,872
The way I look at it,

01:05:00,873 --> 01:05:03,500
there never were any other
guys on the street because,

01:05:05,330 --> 01:05:07,530
Theda, could you bring
me Jack's kit please?

01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,214
- What are you doing?

01:05:11,215 --> 01:05:12,373
Huh, huh?

01:05:12,374 --> 01:05:15,154
(Arnie grunting)
- What are you doing?

01:05:15,155 --> 01:05:18,359
(Arnie grunting)

01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:20,005
- Taking care of it.

01:05:20,006 --> 01:05:23,169
(Arnie grunting)

01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:25,933
How'd you hide those tracks
from the guys at work, Arnie?

01:05:36,650 --> 01:05:37,800
This is how they do it?

01:05:42,590 --> 01:05:44,009
No, there never were any other guys

01:05:44,010 --> 01:05:46,849
because you thought this was
gonna be a nice little rip off.

01:05:46,850 --> 01:05:49,069
Not a big rip off because
a small player like Jack,

01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:50,419
what's he gonna have?

01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:51,773
- It's okay.
- An ounce, maybe two.

01:05:51,774 --> 01:05:54,524
(Arnie grunting)

01:05:56,630 --> 01:05:59,239
What were you gonna do about me, Arnie?

01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:01,019
Manford, your main man.

01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:03,359
You figured I'd take the rap, huh?

01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:04,839
A loony who fell for the guys' girl,

01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:07,813
a hotel clerk with a
fucking history of violence.

01:06:09,206 --> 01:06:12,188
(Arnie grunting)

01:06:12,189 --> 01:06:13,825
(Theda yells)

01:06:13,826 --> 01:06:17,077
(Arnie grunting)

01:06:17,078 --> 01:06:20,411
(Annie yelling muffled)

01:06:27,805 --> 01:06:30,472
(Arnie panting)

01:06:35,611 --> 01:06:38,876
I guess you were right about the violence.

01:06:38,877 --> 01:06:40,949
(elevator dings)

01:06:40,950 --> 01:06:42,200
Go to your room and wait.

01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:53,900
- You okay?

01:06:55,230 --> 01:06:56,230
- Yeah, Pop.

01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:20,253
- Pop, you okay?
- Fuck, I'm miserable.

01:07:22,223 --> 01:07:24,129
(door shuts)
- It's taken care of.

01:07:24,130 --> 01:07:25,597
- I want out.

01:07:25,598 --> 01:07:28,469
You and the girl can have
the map, the mine, take them.

01:07:28,470 --> 01:07:29,683
I just want out.

01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:32,583
- You want out?

01:07:32,583 --> 01:07:33,416
You're gonna let a
junkie steal your dream?

01:07:33,417 --> 01:07:34,559
- Manny, stop, okay?

01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:35,560
Just stop.

01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:42,163
- We all need each other.

01:07:43,340 --> 01:07:45,219
And now we have a secret between us.

01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:46,679
We all have to trust each other now.

01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:48,379
- Don't you think that
they're gonna come after us

01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:49,639
when they find them?

01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:51,119
- But we want the cops to find them.

01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:52,473
It's all tied up.

01:07:53,410 --> 01:07:55,010
I can't think of any loose ends.

01:07:58,247 --> 01:07:59,709
(loud knocking)

01:07:59,710 --> 01:08:01,259
- Who is it?

01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:03,679
- [Carlo] Carlo Russo, hope
I'm not disturbing you.

01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:04,903
- Just a minute.

01:08:12,275 --> 01:08:13,989
- I'm sorry.

01:08:13,990 --> 01:08:15,624
I didn't didn't know you had company.

01:08:15,625 --> 01:08:17,459
- It's all right, come on in.

01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:19,853
Carlo, I'd like to introduce my wife.

01:08:21,618 --> 01:08:23,042
- Uh, hello stranger.

01:08:23,043 --> 01:08:24,929
- Hi.
- You're a sight for sore yes.

01:08:24,930 --> 01:08:27,059
- Long time, no see.
- Good to see you.

01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:28,060
- Hi, oh.

01:08:29,124 --> 01:08:30,768
Where have you been?
- Well, you know.

01:08:30,769 --> 01:08:31,602
- I thought you were doing time.

01:08:31,603 --> 01:08:34,046
- Yeah, I was and uh, I'm back.

01:08:34,047 --> 01:08:36,209
- You're back.
- Yeah.

01:08:36,210 --> 01:08:37,623
Theda and I are old friends.

01:08:39,010 --> 01:08:40,010
You know, we,

01:08:41,270 --> 01:08:42,819
well, anyway, I'm sorry.

01:08:42,820 --> 01:08:44,229
I didn't know you two were married.

01:08:44,230 --> 01:08:46,251
Congratulations, I uh.
- Great.

01:08:46,252 --> 01:08:48,963
- Thank you.
- She's wonderful.

01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:52,933
- Yeah, she is.

01:08:55,410 --> 01:08:57,649
You know, I apologize.

01:08:57,650 --> 01:08:59,809
I must be disturbing.
- Not at all, not at all.

01:08:59,810 --> 01:09:01,969
I was afraid that I
might have insulted you.

01:09:01,970 --> 01:09:04,059
- See, and I was afraid
I came on too strong.

01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:05,313
- What can we do for ya?

01:09:06,370 --> 01:09:07,370
- Look...

01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:10,339
I'm a bloodhound.

01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:13,169
Once I get scent, I don't like to let go.

01:09:13,170 --> 01:09:14,720
- I had that feeling about you.

01:09:17,813 --> 01:09:19,839
- May I propose something?

01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:21,963
- Pop?
- I don't see why not.

01:09:23,310 --> 01:09:24,623
- I'd like to up my offer.

01:09:26,110 --> 01:09:31,110
- Well, I'm gonna have to talk
to the boss about that first.

01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:32,580
I'll need a minute, Theda?

01:09:42,624 --> 01:09:45,974
(lips smacking)
- What?

01:09:45,975 --> 01:09:46,808
- What's going on?

01:09:46,808 --> 01:09:47,641
Do you know this guy?

01:09:47,642 --> 01:09:49,539
- Oh, he's just an old friend.

01:09:49,540 --> 01:09:50,999
I haven't seen him in three years.

01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,264
He's been up at Tonopah.

01:09:52,265 --> 01:09:53,829
- What did he do?

01:09:53,830 --> 01:09:55,839
- Book making, bribing
a gaming commissioner.

01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:56,890
- Does he have money?

01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:59,663
- His family's loaded.

01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:03,019
Baby, he must have just gotten out.

01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:04,317
You can't trust him.

01:10:06,730 --> 01:10:09,480
(couple panting)

01:10:12,113 --> 01:10:14,079
- See, we never built a cabin.

01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:16,169
We got a trailer up there.
- Yeah, I see.

01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:17,739
- Okay.

01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:20,740
Okay, the boss says I have to
at least listen to your offer.

01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:27,279
- Well, as you know, my last offer was.

01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:28,809
- 75?

01:10:28,810 --> 01:10:33,810
- Yeah, well, I managed
to find another 25,000.

01:10:35,490 --> 01:10:36,563
It's all in cash.

01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:38,960
- I don't know.

01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:41,179
We do need some startup capital.

01:10:41,180 --> 01:10:43,609
If we were to sell you, let's say a third,

01:10:43,610 --> 01:10:44,839
how would you feel about that?

01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:45,939
- Whatever you say.

01:10:45,940 --> 01:10:47,909
I'm just eager to get mine.

01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:49,593
- For another 200,000, in cash.

01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:53,683
- 300 large, in cash.

01:10:54,907 --> 01:10:55,907
You outta-

01:10:57,382 --> 01:10:58,632
- That'll be our deposit.

01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:02,440
- Okay.

01:11:03,265 --> 01:11:05,523
But the rest is COD when I see the mine.

01:11:07,910 --> 01:11:08,910
Deal, partner?

01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:11,073
- Deal, partner.

01:11:11,074 --> 01:11:14,289
- Yeah, calls for a celebration!

01:11:14,290 --> 01:11:15,569
Scotch whiskey!

01:11:15,570 --> 01:11:17,239
- I'd like to go up and
see the mine this weekend.

01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:18,749
How's that?

01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:20,279
- That is a great idea.

01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:21,769
- There's still a little muck on the road.

01:11:21,770 --> 01:11:22,680
- Oh, don't worry about that.

01:11:22,681 --> 01:11:25,229
I'll take care of that.
- Thank you, darling.

01:11:25,230 --> 01:11:27,039
- How's the first thing Saturday morning?

01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:29,020
- I'm good.
- That sounds good to me.

01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:32,568
- To the partnership.

01:11:32,569 --> 01:11:34,909
(glasses clinking)
- Salut.

01:11:34,910 --> 01:11:36,993
- Just be careful around Russo, okay.

01:11:38,870 --> 01:11:40,220
- Careful's my middle name.

01:11:45,170 --> 01:11:46,373
- Manny, who's Louise?

01:11:52,428 --> 01:11:53,991
- Louise?

01:11:53,992 --> 01:11:54,992
Louise?

01:11:55,868 --> 01:11:57,004
(dramatic music)

01:11:57,005 --> 01:11:59,355
Louise was my girlfriend.
- Who is he?

01:11:59,356 --> 01:12:01,534
(loud slapping)

01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:03,407
(gun bangs)
(suspenseful music)

01:12:03,408 --> 01:12:06,825
She was involved with Frank Arney Snitch.

01:12:09,250 --> 01:12:10,450
They put me in a corner.

01:12:13,490 --> 01:12:15,840
- Just promise me, you
won't hurt anybody else.

01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:19,403
- I promise.

01:12:23,129 --> 01:12:25,629
(organ music)

01:12:29,610 --> 01:12:31,776
You're a real heartbreaker,
aren't you, Theda?

01:12:31,777 --> 01:12:34,277
(organ music)

01:12:36,396 --> 01:12:38,813
(rock music)

01:12:45,450 --> 01:12:46,839
- Low mileage on this one.

01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:48,549
One of those yuppies drove
it to daycare and back.

01:12:48,550 --> 01:12:50,669
- You wouldn't be trying to
sell me a story, now would you?

01:12:50,670 --> 01:12:53,334
- You don't look like a
guy who'd buy it, if I did.

01:12:53,335 --> 01:12:55,752
(rock music)

01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:15,633
- Right on time.
- Beautiful day for it.

01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:18,123
- Did you bring the money?

01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:23,363
- 200K, just like we agreed.

01:13:26,780 --> 01:13:27,780
Just one problem.

01:13:29,870 --> 01:13:30,870
- What?

01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:34,030
- We're gonna need a receipt.

01:13:35,632 --> 01:13:39,029
- He's gonna need a receipt. (laughs)

01:13:39,030 --> 01:13:40,749
How about if Pop rides with you, Carlo?

01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:41,750
- Okay.

01:13:44,850 --> 01:13:45,850
- My coat.

01:13:55,710 --> 01:13:57,210
I always want of one of these.

01:14:00,510 --> 01:14:02,523
You can sleep in the back, if you need to.

01:14:04,007 --> 01:14:05,613
- I'd love to travel.

01:14:09,470 --> 01:14:10,470
- Look at that.

01:14:11,426 --> 01:14:13,079
That's a Red-tailed Hawk.

01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:14,080
Right there.

01:14:19,006 --> 01:14:24,006
- If I tell you something,
you promise you won't get mad?

01:14:24,524 --> 01:14:25,524
- I won't get mad.

01:14:27,230 --> 01:14:28,230
What?

01:14:32,563 --> 01:14:33,563
What is it?

01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:36,700
- I'm afraid of you.

01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,000
- I know.

01:14:45,490 --> 01:14:47,063
They shouldn't have put me in a corner.

01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:53,610
Do you believe in second chances?

01:14:54,940 --> 01:14:55,940
- Oh, yeah,

01:15:05,297 --> 01:15:06,297
Yeah.

01:15:07,410 --> 01:15:10,077
(country music)

01:15:19,558 --> 01:15:22,572
- [Manny] Theda, I love
this place, already.

01:15:22,573 --> 01:15:25,043
- [Popcorn] Don't worry,
Carlo, it'll be safe here.

01:15:26,142 --> 01:15:27,191
What do you say, Carlo?

01:15:27,192 --> 01:15:28,033
You smell that.

01:15:28,034 --> 01:15:30,199
Can you smell it?

01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:31,947
That's the smell of gold.

01:15:31,948 --> 01:15:34,365
(rock music)

01:15:36,970 --> 01:15:38,169
There she is.

01:15:38,170 --> 01:15:40,419
Now, you're at my house.

01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:41,330
- [Carlo] Jesus Christ,

01:15:41,331 --> 01:15:42,767
you know, until you actually see this-

01:15:42,768 --> 01:15:43,919
- [Popcorn] You're standing on a fortune.

01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:46,599
Vein runs right under your feet.

01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:48,739
Manny, here's the key.

01:15:48,740 --> 01:15:50,573
Open her up.
- Let's take a look.

01:15:52,950 --> 01:15:55,259
- [Popcorn] Let me fire up the generator.

01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:57,069
I gotta pump out that methane gas.

01:15:57,070 --> 01:15:58,770
Otherwise, we'll all get blown up.

01:16:01,121 --> 01:16:04,038
(Popcorn laughing)

01:16:05,910 --> 01:16:07,560
- [Carlo] Man, I love it up here.

01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:10,980
Hey, Pop, who's this guy?

01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:15,009
- Ah, that was my first partner.

01:16:15,010 --> 01:16:17,359
Couldn't stick, didn't have the patience.

01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:18,513
Wanna get the lights?

01:16:24,078 --> 01:16:25,245
- Here you go.

01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:28,129
- I can't go in there.

01:16:28,130 --> 01:16:29,211
I'm claustrophobic.

01:16:29,212 --> 01:16:32,589
- Ah, you'll get used to it.
- Not me, I can't.

01:16:32,590 --> 01:16:34,123
- Well, let's go have a look!

01:16:36,940 --> 01:16:37,940
- Hey!

01:16:45,206 --> 01:16:46,449
Don't be too long down there.

01:16:46,450 --> 01:16:49,419
- Don't worry, bears will keep
you company if you miss us.

01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:50,489
- Very funny.

01:16:50,490 --> 01:16:54,345
- Carlo, that and the methane.

01:16:54,346 --> 01:16:58,099
(Carlo playfully imitates explosion)

01:16:58,100 --> 01:16:59,100
Thank you.

01:17:05,450 --> 01:17:06,453
- Okay, okay.

01:17:07,950 --> 01:17:10,909
I ran smack dab in the middle
of it, up there a little ways.

01:17:10,910 --> 01:17:14,199
This here is about seven
years of work to this point.

01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:16,493
Manny, throw some light down there.

01:17:20,290 --> 01:17:21,290
See that?

01:17:22,433 --> 01:17:25,289
That air shaft is an old mine
that leads to another vein,

01:17:25,290 --> 01:17:28,249
goes all the way through the
other side of the mountain.

01:17:28,250 --> 01:17:29,629
- Is it as rich as this one?

01:17:29,630 --> 01:17:31,639
- Oh, that one is huge.

01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:34,289
Had to abandon that one
because of the accident.

01:17:34,290 --> 01:17:36,339
Well, start looking around, Carlo.

01:17:36,340 --> 01:17:38,599
The rich stuff is heavy and crusted.

01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:39,989
It's burnish, not shiny.

01:17:39,990 --> 01:17:42,089
Sticks together, that's how you know.

01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:44,049
There's ore lying all over here.

01:17:44,050 --> 01:17:45,203
Pick yourself up some.

01:17:46,220 --> 01:17:48,679
(electric whirring)
(pensive music)

01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:49,513
- What the hell is that?

01:17:49,514 --> 01:17:53,649
- Shit, that's that old
generator going out on me again.

01:17:53,650 --> 01:17:55,319
I'll go straighten that out.

01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:57,449
But don't wait for me, go on ahead.

01:17:57,450 --> 01:17:58,749
There's a little quartz vein,

01:17:58,750 --> 01:18:00,969
it weighs down on the
right, you gotta see it.

01:18:00,970 --> 01:18:03,379
Make a grown man cry.

01:18:03,380 --> 01:18:05,977
Manny, wanna help me out?

01:18:12,406 --> 01:18:14,209
- I think I better keep an eye on him.

01:18:14,210 --> 01:18:15,960
- Manny.
- Oh, no, it's okay, Pop.

01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:33,609
- You religious, Manny?
- Sometimes.

01:18:33,610 --> 01:18:36,210
- Because this sure is the
answer to a man's prayer.

01:18:41,970 --> 01:18:43,169
- We gotta stake as
much as this as we can.

01:18:43,170 --> 01:18:44,619
Don't tell anybody.

01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:45,453
- Don't worry about me.

01:18:45,453 --> 01:18:46,320
I can keep a secret.

01:18:46,321 --> 01:18:47,832
You're getting your nice suit all dirty.

01:18:47,833 --> 01:18:49,319
- (laughs) What, are you kidding?

01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:51,070
I can afford thousand of these now.

01:18:54,086 --> 01:18:56,919
(chains clanking)

01:18:57,884 --> 01:19:02,884
(loud popping)
(Manny panting)

01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:07,640
- Get the briefcase.

01:19:09,850 --> 01:19:10,850
- Yeah, let's go.

01:19:13,918 --> 01:19:14,751
I'll get it.

01:19:14,752 --> 01:19:16,793
- She's laying here, right in front of us.

01:19:19,139 --> 01:19:20,726
Look at this.

01:19:20,727 --> 01:19:22,423
It's a fucking watch.

01:19:24,612 --> 01:19:25,893
Oh shit.
- What, what?

01:19:27,660 --> 01:19:28,660
- What the fuck?

01:19:32,814 --> 01:19:37,814
(Manny grunting)
(boulder dragging)

01:19:38,971 --> 01:19:43,289
(Manny vomiting)
- Jesus, it's his partner.

01:19:43,290 --> 01:19:44,200
What the fuck, man?

01:19:44,201 --> 01:19:46,773
- I didn't know!
(gun bangs)

01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:48,800
- Aw, shit.

01:19:54,602 --> 01:19:56,228
(gun bangs)

01:19:56,229 --> 01:19:57,669
- Hook that up.

01:19:57,670 --> 01:19:58,740
We need more time.

01:20:00,509 --> 01:20:02,141
- You're a liar.

01:20:02,142 --> 01:20:04,725
(guns banging)

01:20:17,313 --> 01:20:18,313

01:20:19,362 --> 01:20:21,945
(guns banging)

01:20:32,702 --> 01:20:35,535
(chains clanking)

01:20:38,548 --> 01:20:39,548
Theda, run!

01:20:41,210 --> 01:20:44,149
Theda, get out of there!

01:20:44,150 --> 01:20:45,687
Run!

01:20:45,688 --> 01:20:46,688
- No, no!

01:20:47,525 --> 01:20:49,612

01:20:49,613 --> 01:20:51,998

(light classical music)

01:22:43,030 --> 01:22:45,373
- Miss Dobbs?
- Yes.

01:22:46,610 --> 01:22:48,479
- My name is Roy Morrison.

01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:49,313
- [Woman] How do you?

01:22:49,314 --> 01:22:51,169
- I'm an acquaintance of your father's.

01:22:51,170 --> 01:22:54,179
- [Woman] Of course, it's about
the gold mountain property.

01:22:54,180 --> 01:22:56,769
- Do you mind if I join you?
- Please.

01:22:56,770 --> 01:22:57,770
- Thank you.

01:23:00,190 --> 01:23:01,679
I know the mine is down in Mexico,

01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:02,989
but I thought we could make arrangements

01:23:02,990 --> 01:23:03,940
to go see the property.

01:23:03,941 --> 01:23:06,149
- Well, you have ask the boss, here he is.

01:23:06,150 --> 01:23:08,259
Hi, dad.
- Hey there, Roy.

01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:10,869
- Hi.
- I see you met my daughter.

01:23:10,870 --> 01:23:13,819
She's single, Roy.
(Roy laughs nervously)

01:23:13,820 --> 01:23:15,870
- Just to prove my intentions are honest.

01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:27,409
- It's an awful lot of money.

01:23:27,410 --> 01:23:29,179
- It's just something to prime the pump.

01:23:29,180 --> 01:23:30,380
- It's very nice of you,

01:23:31,410 --> 01:23:32,350
but to be quite honest,

01:23:32,351 --> 01:23:34,329
it's hardly enough to get started

01:23:34,330 --> 01:23:36,139
and it's not even certified.

01:23:36,140 --> 01:23:37,719
- My daughter thinks
she has a better chance

01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:40,549
to raise capital with a
stock placement, an IPO.

01:23:40,550 --> 01:23:42,916
- How much money would
you need to get operation?

01:23:42,917 --> 01:23:44,129
- $2 million.

01:23:44,130 --> 01:23:46,229
It's an all or nothing deal.

01:23:46,230 --> 01:23:47,799
If you don't take the risk,

01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:50,077
you can't make the win, Mr. Morrison.

01:23:55,830 --> 01:23:57,630
- I thought I recognized that voice.

01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:00,500
How are you, Pop?

01:24:02,060 --> 01:24:03,729
- Son of a gun.

01:24:03,730 --> 01:24:05,339
- Business must be pretty good.

01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:07,793
You both look flush.

01:24:09,514 --> 01:24:10,514
- Hello, Manny.

01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:14,293
- Manny, this is Roy Morrison.

01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:18,088
- Manny DeSilva, good to meet you like.

01:24:18,089 --> 01:24:19,089
- Likewise.

01:24:19,985 --> 01:24:21,739
- [Popcorn] Where have you
been keeping yourself, Manny?

01:24:21,740 --> 01:24:23,529
We lost touch.

01:24:23,530 --> 01:24:25,249
- It's a long story and I
don't want to interrupt.

01:24:25,250 --> 01:24:26,619
I just wanted to thank you again

01:24:26,620 --> 01:24:28,220
for that tip on that gold claim.

01:24:29,220 --> 01:24:30,809

01:24:40,975 --> 01:24:42,539
a thousand bags of gold doubloons

01:24:42,540 --> 01:24:44,590
left behind by the Spanish conquistadors.

01:24:46,283 --> 01:24:48,203
(scoffs) Priceless.

01:24:52,010 --> 01:24:53,910
You're in good company with these two.

01:24:55,129 --> 01:24:56,129
You can't go wrong.

01:24:58,919 --> 01:24:59,919
I'll be in touch.

01:25:00,632 --> 01:25:03,965

01:25:10,334 --> 01:25:15,334
(couple moaning)
(jazzy music)

01:25:21,238 --> 01:25:22,488
- I'm so sorry.

01:25:23,591 --> 01:25:24,722
I'm so sorry.

01:25:24,723 --> 01:25:27,640
- Shh, shh, don't talk, don't talk.

01:25:28,503 --> 01:25:30,336
- I tried to stop him.

01:25:32,291 --> 01:25:33,958
I tried to stop him.

01:25:34,916 --> 01:25:36,083
I'm so sorry.

01:25:38,973 --> 01:25:41,013
- You broke my heart.

01:25:41,014 --> 01:25:44,097
(bluesy jazzy music)

01:25:49,363 --> 01:25:51,403
- [Roy] Mr. Dobbs, this is Roy Morrison.

01:25:52,420 --> 01:25:54,209
Do you know what I have
right here in my hand?

01:25:54,210 --> 01:25:56,769
I have a cashier's check
in the amount we discussed.

01:25:56,770 --> 01:25:58,239
How soon can we go see the mine?

01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:00,869
- Well, maybe the snow is melted by now.

01:26:00,870 --> 01:26:01,989
- [Roy] The snow?
