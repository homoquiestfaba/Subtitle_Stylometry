[Phil sighs]

3
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:53,417
Don't worry, Mare.

4
00:01:53,591 --> 00:01:55,637
I'll take good care of him.

5
00:01:55,811 --> 00:01:57,682
Once I get him
working in the fields,
he'll be in good shape.

6
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:00,381
I know he will.

7
00:02:00,555 --> 00:02:02,861
It just doesn't make it
any easier to see him
leave home.

8
00:02:03,035 --> 00:02:04,646
Yeah.

9
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,779
-Do you still have
that show pony?
-I do.

10
00:02:09,216 --> 00:02:11,261
Well, If you need any help
with him, you let me know.

11
00:02:11,435 --> 00:02:14,960
I'll send James over
when I can, and he'll
keep an eye on him.

12
00:02:15,744 --> 00:02:17,920
He's not doing too good.

13
00:02:18,094 --> 00:02:21,619
I had the vet out again.
He's kinda colicky,
he hasn't been eatin'.

14
00:02:21,793 --> 00:02:23,665
I don't know
what else to do.

15
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,407
It's a shame.

16
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:28,104
I know how you
love these horses.

17
00:02:28,278 --> 00:02:29,671
Yeah, well,

18
00:02:29,845 --> 00:02:31,412
you take good care
of him for me, okay?

19
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:33,153
Will do.

20
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,387
[music playing

21
00:02:50,561 --> 00:02:52,998
[Susan]
I understand. Yes.

22
00:02:53,347 --> 00:02:54,174
Monday?

23
00:02:54,348 --> 00:02:56,132
Okay, that sounds great.

24
00:02:56,306 --> 00:02:57,916
Alright, we'll see you then.

25
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,222
Okay, thanks.

26
00:02:59,396 --> 00:03:00,789
Bye.

27
00:03:06,751 --> 00:03:09,145
Lizzy, if you need us,
all you have to do is call.

28
00:03:10,755 --> 00:03:12,017
Lizzy.

29
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,715
[music continues playing

30
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:14,977
Lizzy!

[horn blaring]

32
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:22,637
Are you insane?

33
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:24,987
Your mother
was talking to you.

34
00:03:25,161 --> 00:03:27,294
Lizzy this visit is going
to be good for you.

35
00:03:27,468 --> 00:03:28,469
Whatever.

36
00:03:28,643 --> 00:03:30,253
You're still abandoning me.

37
00:03:30,427 --> 00:03:31,820
That's not true.

38
00:03:31,994 --> 00:03:33,474
-No?
-No.

39
00:03:33,648 --> 00:03:35,998
You'll get some fresh air,
clear your head,

40
00:03:36,172 --> 00:03:38,827
spend time with Grandma
and the horses.

41
00:03:39,001 --> 00:03:41,133
Okay.

42
00:03:41,308 --> 00:03:44,311
Lizzy, if we could stay
with you, we would,
but we have to work.

43
00:03:44,485 --> 00:03:46,748
Yeah.

44
00:03:46,922 --> 00:03:48,663
You know, it really sucks
being kicked out of your
own house for Christmas.

45
00:03:48,837 --> 00:03:50,969
I know, sweetie,
I know,

46
00:03:51,796 --> 00:03:53,233
but you'll be alright.

47
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,112
[car doors open, close]

48
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:05,375
-Hi, Mary.
-Hey.

49
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:08,335
-You made it.
-We did.

50
00:04:08,509 --> 00:04:10,337
Let me see this face.
Do I recognize it?

51
00:04:10,511 --> 00:04:12,164
Yeah, thanks, Mom.

52
00:04:12,339 --> 00:04:14,210
-It's hard getting
out of the city.
-I know.

53
00:04:14,384 --> 00:04:15,472
So, how are you?
You look lovely.

54
00:04:15,646 --> 00:04:16,865
Oh, thank you.

55
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:19,084
-How's business?
-It's good, busy.

56
00:04:19,737 --> 00:04:22,174
-Busy is good.
-Mm-hmm.

57
00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:24,176
So, where's my granddaughter?

58
00:04:24,351 --> 00:04:27,223
She won't get out
of the car until we leave.

59
00:04:28,093 --> 00:04:29,530
-Really?
-Hmm.

60
00:04:29,704 --> 00:04:31,793
Mom, you have no idea.
It's been rough.

61
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:43,892
Hey. Why don't you come out
and say hi to your Grandma?

62
00:04:44,066 --> 00:04:45,720
[Lizzy sighs]

63
00:04:49,376 --> 00:04:50,551
Hi.

64
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,299
See what I mean?

65
00:04:59,473 --> 00:05:02,780
Ah, well,
strong-willed, moody...

66
00:05:03,868 --> 00:05:06,393
-I wonder where
she gets it from.
-[both laughing]

67
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:08,046
It's called
being a teenager.

68
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,874
She'll be fine.

69
00:05:10,048 --> 00:05:12,007
Well, I hope this time away
will be good for her.

70
00:05:12,181 --> 00:05:14,226
I'm sure it will.

71
00:05:14,401 --> 00:05:16,707
And it'll be nice
to have somebody here
living with me, too.

72
00:05:16,881 --> 00:05:20,015
So, can I get you a cup
of coffee, fix you a snack
before you hit the road?

73
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:22,583
Oh, we have contracts
we have to get in
first thing in the morning,

74
00:05:22,757 --> 00:05:24,236
and it's a really
long drive.

75
00:05:24,411 --> 00:05:27,283
-We wish we could though.
-Yeah, I understand.

76
00:05:27,457 --> 00:05:29,633
-We'll see you later.
-Okay.

77
00:05:29,807 --> 00:05:31,766
-Good to see you.
-So good to see you.

78
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,898
If she gives you any trouble,
let me know.

79
00:05:34,072 --> 00:05:35,683
I'll come pick her up
if I have to.

80
00:05:35,857 --> 00:05:38,120
I'm sure she's going
to be just fine.

81
00:05:38,294 --> 00:05:39,339
Now, you guys drive safe.

82
00:05:39,513 --> 00:05:40,688
Thanks, Mary.

83
00:05:40,862 --> 00:05:42,298
-[Mary] Miss you.
-[Susan] Bye.

84
00:05:46,215 --> 00:05:47,172
[engine starts]

85
00:05:55,964 --> 00:05:57,792
You want something to eat?

86
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,141
No.

87
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,623
Something to drink?

88
00:06:02,797 --> 00:06:04,364
-Stupid phone.
-[slams phone]

89
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:08,150
How about
we go for a hike?

90
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:10,282
I hate nature.

91
00:06:10,457 --> 00:06:12,197
I'm just going
to go to my room.

92
00:06:13,285 --> 00:06:16,027
-Do you want help unpacking?
-I'm fine.

93
00:06:16,811 --> 00:06:18,247
Your bags are in your room.

94
00:06:23,687 --> 00:06:25,646
This is a horrible picture
of me.

95
00:06:28,344 --> 00:06:29,911
I love this picture of you.

96
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,826
I look stupid.

97
00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:35,307
Okay.

98
00:06:35,482 --> 00:06:37,092
Let's go for a walk.

99
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,268
Now.

100
00:06:58,026 --> 00:07:00,376
Didn't you guys use to have
a lot of horses here?

101
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:04,119
Yeah, me and your grandpa
used to have seven.

102
00:07:06,121 --> 00:07:07,035
Do you miss him?

103
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,907
What, your grandfather?

104
00:07:10,908 --> 00:07:12,214
Yeah, of course I do.

105
00:07:13,128 --> 00:07:15,217
What do you remember
about him?

106
00:07:15,391 --> 00:07:17,393
He'd give me a dollar
every time I'd visit.

107
00:07:18,568 --> 00:07:20,222
[chuckles] Figures.

108
00:07:25,923 --> 00:07:27,969
Why don't we go take
a look at my pony?

109
00:07:41,852 --> 00:07:43,419
Where are they?

110
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,247
Keep going.

111
00:07:52,428 --> 00:07:54,256
She's so cute.

112
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:00,088
Is something wrong with her?

113
00:08:00,784 --> 00:08:02,438
He's very sick.

114
00:08:03,221 --> 00:08:04,745
He's got colic.

115
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:07,748
And, well, I had the vet
out to look at him,

116
00:08:07,922 --> 00:08:09,967
but he hasn't been eating
anything at all, and...

117
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:12,448
I don't know what else
to do with him.

118
00:08:12,622 --> 00:08:15,103
I don't have the time
to sit here...

119
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:16,887
[sighs]

120
00:08:17,061 --> 00:08:18,236
...and just be with him
all day.

121
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,977
I've tried
everything I know.

122
00:08:20,674 --> 00:08:22,284
What about the rest of them?

123
00:08:24,808 --> 00:08:27,724
I, um, I couldn't take care
of them anymore.

124
00:08:27,898 --> 00:08:29,160
So, you just gave them away?

125
00:08:29,334 --> 00:08:32,163
No, Lizzy.
It's not as easy as that.

126
00:08:32,337 --> 00:08:34,775
-It's not important
right now--
-Not important?

127
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:38,343
I know exactly
how they felt.

128
00:08:39,127 --> 00:08:40,824
Nobody wants me either.

129
00:08:41,608 --> 00:08:43,348
You are wanted.

130
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,481
And you're very much loved.

131
00:08:49,616 --> 00:08:51,748
What's this one's name?

132
00:08:51,922 --> 00:08:53,794
Well, he doesn't
have a barn name yet.

133
00:08:53,968 --> 00:08:56,797
I couldn't come up
with a name that
I thought would fit,

134
00:08:56,971 --> 00:08:58,973
so I thought that
you might want to name him.

135
00:08:59,451 --> 00:09:01,279
Seriously?

136
00:09:01,453 --> 00:09:03,499
Yeah, but you have
to take care of him.

137
00:09:04,413 --> 00:09:05,806
That's the deal.

138
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,938
If you name him,
you take care of him.

139
00:09:09,244 --> 00:09:12,900
I don't know anything
about taking care of a horse.

140
00:09:13,074 --> 00:09:16,643
Raising horses
is in your blood.
It'll come to you.

141
00:09:16,817 --> 00:09:18,340
I've never done it before.

142
00:09:19,689 --> 00:09:21,212
Well, he is very sick,

143
00:09:21,386 --> 00:09:22,953
and he needs a friend
right now.

144
00:09:23,127 --> 00:09:26,174
And frankly, I think that
you could use one, too.

145
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,873
What do you say?

146
00:09:30,787 --> 00:09:32,006
Hmm?

147
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:33,747
I don't know.

148
00:09:33,921 --> 00:09:35,357
[sighs]

149
00:09:36,488 --> 00:09:39,448
A horse has to really,
really trust you.

150
00:09:39,622 --> 00:09:41,885
And you can't force it.

151
00:09:43,191 --> 00:09:46,107
And for some reason,
this is my last one,

152
00:09:46,281 --> 00:09:49,458
and I have not been able
to contact with him.

153
00:09:49,632 --> 00:09:52,200
So, I just want you to try.

154
00:09:53,854 --> 00:09:55,203
What do you say?

155
00:09:55,682 --> 00:09:57,074
We got a deal?

156
00:09:58,423 --> 00:09:59,381
Hmm?

157
00:09:59,903 --> 00:10:02,210
Okay. Deal.

158
00:10:15,527 --> 00:10:16,703
You poor thing.

159
00:10:16,877 --> 00:10:19,575
[musical snow globe

160
00:10:27,322 --> 00:10:28,584
[knock on door]

161
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:30,586
Hey.

162
00:10:31,935 --> 00:10:33,589
Brought you some
fresh towels.

163
00:10:35,547 --> 00:10:36,592
Thanks.

164
00:10:38,986 --> 00:10:40,596
Your mom got me that.

165
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,206
Did you know that?

166
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,730
Cool.

167
00:10:43,904 --> 00:10:45,514
You know, I love the snow.

168
00:10:46,254 --> 00:10:48,169
I wish it snowed more here.

169
00:10:49,431 --> 00:10:51,215
What about you?

170
00:10:51,389 --> 00:10:53,391
If you could do
anything you wanted,

171
00:10:54,088 --> 00:10:56,003
no restrictions,

172
00:10:56,177 --> 00:10:58,092
what do you want to do
with your life?

173
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,007
I don't know.

174
00:11:00,877 --> 00:11:02,096
I guess...

175
00:11:04,011 --> 00:11:06,404
I guess I'd want
to be somebody important,

176
00:11:06,578 --> 00:11:08,363
and do something good.

177
00:11:08,537 --> 00:11:10,974
Like helping people?

178
00:11:11,975 --> 00:11:13,281
I guess.

179
00:11:14,804 --> 00:11:18,155
I just don't want to be
obsessed with my job
like my parents are.

180
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:19,679
Hmm.

181
00:11:21,768 --> 00:11:23,291
Yeah, it's whatever.

182
00:11:24,814 --> 00:11:26,120
Okay, well,

183
00:11:26,294 --> 00:11:27,861
I'll leave you be now.

184
00:11:28,035 --> 00:11:29,863
If you get bored,
you want to read a book,

185
00:11:30,037 --> 00:11:31,560
your grandfather's got some
down the hall.

186
00:11:31,734 --> 00:11:35,042
He used to read everything.

187
00:11:35,216 --> 00:11:37,653
How about grilled
cheese sandwiches
and tomato soup?

188
00:11:38,132 --> 00:11:40,308
-Sure.
-Okay.

189
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,062
[clicking]

190
00:11:55,236 --> 00:11:57,412
[soft music playing]

191
00:12:25,832 --> 00:12:27,181
Where?

192
00:12:36,973 --> 00:12:39,367
Well, now
what's beating you?

193
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:42,762
I can't find any of those
stupid horse books anywhere.

194
00:12:44,328 --> 00:12:46,026
There's a white trunk
in my room.

195
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,245
I bet you they're in there.

196
00:12:49,246 --> 00:12:51,553
Hopefully, you didn't
give them away.

197
00:12:59,517 --> 00:13:00,736
Nope.

198
00:13:12,052 --> 00:13:13,575
[sighs]

199
00:13:23,498 --> 00:13:24,760
Finally.

200
00:13:39,383 --> 00:13:42,778
Wow. There's a lot.

201
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,632
Whoa, where you going?

202
00:14:10,806 --> 00:14:12,547
I'm going to go
be in the barn.

203
00:14:12,721 --> 00:14:14,462
Do you have any carrots?
This book says horses
like carrots.

204
00:14:14,636 --> 00:14:18,118
-What about dinner?
-I gotta go.

205
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:20,337
Well, we eat at 6:00.
Don't be late.

206
00:14:20,511 --> 00:14:21,512
Okay.

207
00:14:32,262 --> 00:14:34,221
Hey, boy,
look what I brought you.

208
00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:35,831
[sniffing]

209
00:14:49,714 --> 00:14:51,325
Come on, try it.

210
00:14:52,326 --> 00:14:54,241
You got to eat
something, babe.

211
00:14:56,156 --> 00:14:57,418
Come on.

212
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:05,382
[sighs]

213
00:15:06,296 --> 00:15:08,255
Why won't you eat?

214
00:15:22,443 --> 00:15:24,314
-Hey, Mare.
-Hi.

215
00:15:24,488 --> 00:15:26,186
-How's my horse doing?
-Good.

216
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,232
Um, he's liking
his new home.

217
00:15:29,406 --> 00:15:31,191
Dad said we're going to start
training him tomorrow.

218
00:15:31,365 --> 00:15:32,583
-Oh, that's great.
-Yeah.

219
00:15:32,757 --> 00:15:33,889
How's everything else
at home?

220
00:15:34,063 --> 00:15:35,717
Pretty good.
It's just busy.

221
00:15:35,891 --> 00:15:37,545
There's a lot of people
coming over for Christmas.

222
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:38,850
That should be nice.

223
00:15:39,025 --> 00:15:40,852
Yeah, it's just hectic.

224
00:15:41,027 --> 00:15:42,942
-What, not a fan?
-No.

225
00:15:43,116 --> 00:15:44,465
I like it nice and quiet.

226
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,380
I get a lot more work
done that way.

227
00:15:46,554 --> 00:15:48,904
Did you get my little
project finished?

228
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:51,428
Thank you.

229
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,736
Oh, my gosh.

230
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,695
Perfect.
Absolutely perfect.

231
00:15:57,869 --> 00:15:59,567
-Thank you.
-Cool.

232
00:16:00,176 --> 00:16:01,873
Smells good, by the way.

233
00:16:02,048 --> 00:16:03,745
Well, you'll have to sit down
and have some dinner.

234
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:05,399
No, no, no.
I can't.

235
00:16:05,573 --> 00:16:07,531
I didn't expect you
to make dinner for me.

236
00:16:07,705 --> 00:16:09,229
Come on.

237
00:16:09,403 --> 00:16:11,492
I told Lizzy dinner
was at 6:00, and it is,

238
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,668
it is almost 6:30,
so let's eat.

239
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,414
Dear heavenly Father,
thank you for this food,
for wonderful neighbors,

240
00:16:20,588 --> 00:16:22,329
for this day,
for my granddaughter.

241
00:16:22,503 --> 00:16:24,548
And help us to use this
food to nourish our bodies.

242
00:16:24,722 --> 00:16:26,463
-Amen.
-Amen.

243
00:16:37,692 --> 00:16:40,347
-So, Lizzy's staying
for Christmas?
-Mm-hmm.

244
00:16:40,521 --> 00:16:42,175
Her parents have to work.

245
00:16:42,349 --> 00:16:44,612
Real estate
is a tough business.

246
00:16:44,786 --> 00:16:47,093
They got a couple
of really big deals closing
at the end of the year.

247
00:16:50,313 --> 00:16:51,706
Oh, Lizzy,

248
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,013
this is James. James,
my granddaughter, Lizzy.

249
00:16:54,665 --> 00:16:55,753
Hi.

250
00:16:55,927 --> 00:16:57,538
Is that my dinner?

251
00:16:57,712 --> 00:17:01,629
Um, I said dinner was at 6:00
and it's 6:30 now.

252
00:17:01,803 --> 00:17:03,935
So, what am I
supposed to do, starve?

253
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:06,503
No, I'm sure that there's
more carrots in the fridge.

254
00:17:09,941 --> 00:17:11,465
[shouts] Argh!

255
00:17:11,639 --> 00:17:13,728
-[chuckling]
-[Lizzy grunts loudly]

256
00:17:14,642 --> 00:17:16,818
-Oh, dear.
-I should probably go.

257
00:17:16,992 --> 00:17:18,994
Don't worry about it, James.
She's going to be fine.

258
00:17:19,168 --> 00:17:21,518
She's just a little bit
frustrated right now.

259
00:17:22,606 --> 00:17:25,000
-Will I see you tomorrow?
-Tomorrow?

260
00:17:25,174 --> 00:17:27,742
Yeah, I think that she is going
to need a little bit of help
with that pony.

261
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:30,223
I mean, yeah, yeah.

262
00:17:30,397 --> 00:17:32,399
I'll have to check with Dad
if he needs me to work
on the farm, but sure.

263
00:17:32,573 --> 00:17:35,532
You tell Phil I said
he works you too hard.

264
00:17:36,968 --> 00:17:39,841
Oh, that reminds me.
I promised I'd help
him set up the tree.

265
00:17:40,015 --> 00:17:41,495
I gotta go.

266
00:17:41,973 --> 00:17:43,410
Okay.

267
00:17:43,584 --> 00:17:45,847
-Thanks for dinner.
-Thank you.

268
00:18:18,184 --> 00:18:21,752
None of these stupid books
are telling me anything about
taking care of a horse.

269
00:18:21,926 --> 00:18:23,537
How am I supposed to
know what I am doing?

270
00:18:23,711 --> 00:18:25,756
You told me
to take care of him.

271
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:29,412
Let's go inside.
I'll make you
something to eat.

272
00:18:29,586 --> 00:18:32,981
Not until I figure out
how to feed him.

273
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:36,724
Why don't we give him
a blanket, and we'll
get you warmed up?

274
00:18:36,898 --> 00:18:39,727
How am I supposed to know
what I'm supposed to do?

275
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:41,903
You told me
to take care of him.

276
00:18:42,077 --> 00:18:43,687
I don't know anything
about taking care
of a stupid horse!

277
00:18:43,861 --> 00:18:45,211
That's enough.

278
00:18:47,256 --> 00:18:49,867
Okay?
Inside the house.

279
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,217
Dinner time.

280
00:18:52,348 --> 00:18:53,436
Fine.

281
00:18:59,573 --> 00:19:02,576
-This is for you.
-What is it?

282
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:04,665
Open it.

283
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:06,362
I had a friend of mine
make you something.

284
00:19:06,536 --> 00:19:08,451
The boy who ate my dinner?

285
00:19:16,677 --> 00:19:17,939
A horse.

286
00:19:18,896 --> 00:19:22,030
Not just a horse.
He was my horse,

287
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:23,988
and his name was Hercules.

288
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,382
-Hercules?
-Yeah,

289
00:19:26,556 --> 00:19:28,950
and he was the best
show jumper around.

290
00:19:30,691 --> 00:19:32,040
Did you give him away, too?

291
00:19:36,566 --> 00:19:38,177
I have to go check
on the pony.

292
00:19:42,398 --> 00:19:43,965
Lunch at noon.

293
00:20:03,027 --> 00:20:04,420
Grandma!

294
00:20:04,594 --> 00:20:07,162
-I've got a name for him.
-For the pony?

295
00:20:07,771 --> 00:20:08,816
Hope.

296
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,470
-Hope?
-Yeah.

297
00:20:11,732 --> 00:20:13,908
That sounds good.
It fits.

298
00:20:14,082 --> 00:20:15,518
[chuckles]

299
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,829
I know you know why
my parents sent me here.

300
00:20:24,135 --> 00:20:26,007
But I'm not a bad kid.

301
00:20:27,095 --> 00:20:28,705
I know you're not.

302
00:20:30,011 --> 00:20:32,100
I didn't mean
for it to happen.

303
00:20:33,449 --> 00:20:35,712
I just got so tired
of everything.

304
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,889
Then everything got bad.

305
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:43,067
Why don't you show them
you can do something good?

306
00:20:44,068 --> 00:20:45,505
What do you mean?

307
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,594
Let them know
they can trust you,

308
00:20:47,768 --> 00:20:49,030
see the good in you.

309
00:20:50,945 --> 00:20:53,034
Do you think I could
do that with Hope?

310
00:20:54,165 --> 00:20:55,210
Maybe.

311
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,867
Thanks for this.

312
00:21:00,433 --> 00:21:01,825
Yeah.

313
00:21:01,999 --> 00:21:03,523
Why don't you
clean out the stall?

314
00:21:03,697 --> 00:21:05,742
It gets a little bit cold
and wet at night-time.

315
00:21:06,482 --> 00:21:07,701
Okay.

316
00:21:15,012 --> 00:21:16,057
[Lizzy] Yeah.

317
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:22,237
You're going to be all nice
and warm tonight, aren't you?

318
00:21:36,033 --> 00:21:37,252
[chuckles]

319
00:21:40,211 --> 00:21:41,387
Come on, eat it.

320
00:21:43,476 --> 00:21:44,781
[laughs]

321
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:47,915
Good boy.

322
00:21:49,003 --> 00:21:50,265
You're actually eating it.

323
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:51,919
[laughing]

324
00:21:55,052 --> 00:21:56,010
Yeah.

325
00:21:57,098 --> 00:21:58,273
Good boy.

326
00:22:00,928 --> 00:22:03,191
I can't believe
you're actually eating it.

327
00:22:04,671 --> 00:22:06,325
Good job, boy.

328
00:22:10,285 --> 00:22:12,331
You're going to get stronger
in no time.

329
00:22:17,771 --> 00:22:19,990
He hasn't eaten in days.

330
00:22:20,164 --> 00:22:22,123
I've got to see this
to believe it.

331
00:22:24,778 --> 00:22:26,257
Man, that thing's heavy.

332
00:22:26,432 --> 00:22:28,172
Yeah, it's heavy.
This is a farm.

333
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,565
[Lizzy chuckles]

334
00:22:29,739 --> 00:22:31,001
Let's go.
Show me your stuff.

335
00:22:31,175 --> 00:22:32,351
Alright.

336
00:22:33,569 --> 00:22:36,006
Hey. Here you go.

337
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:39,488
Yeah, he's been eating hay
and carrots all night.

338
00:22:39,662 --> 00:22:41,142
Haven't you, boy?

339
00:22:41,969 --> 00:22:43,623
I don't believe this.

340
00:22:44,232 --> 00:22:45,842
You're amazing.

341
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,627
Alright, I'm going
to go make breakfast, okay?

342
00:22:47,801 --> 00:22:50,151
-See you up in ten?
-Okay.

343
00:22:50,325 --> 00:22:52,458
Would you pick up the mail
on your way up, please?

344
00:22:52,632 --> 00:22:53,937
Sure.

345
00:22:54,111 --> 00:22:55,896
[both chuckling]

346
00:22:59,726 --> 00:23:01,162
Good boy.

347
00:23:44,205 --> 00:23:46,163
Perfect timing,
breakfast is ready.

348
00:23:46,337 --> 00:23:48,557
-You're going
to lose the ranch?
-What?

349
00:23:48,731 --> 00:23:51,125
This letter, it says
the bank is going to
take the ranch from you.

350
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:54,737
-You opened my mail?
-So, it's true then.

351
00:23:54,911 --> 00:23:56,870
You shouldn't open
other people's mail, Lizzy.

352
00:23:57,044 --> 00:23:59,046
You knew this was going
to happen, didn't you?

353
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,526
I owe them money.

354
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,702
-How much?
-A lot.

355
00:24:02,876 --> 00:24:05,052
That is none of your business.

356
00:24:07,054 --> 00:24:08,751
How did this even happen?

357
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:14,235
Ever since your grandfather
died, I have had to run
this place on my own.

358
00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:17,630
Putting my horses in shows,
winning some money.

359
00:24:17,804 --> 00:24:21,634
I've gone through
my savings, all just
to try to make ends meet.

360
00:24:21,808 --> 00:24:26,900
You have no idea what
it costs to keep a place
like this running.

361
00:24:27,727 --> 00:24:29,250
Wouldn't have been so bad,

362
00:24:29,424 --> 00:24:32,732
but last couple of years,
and some early frost.

363
00:24:32,906 --> 00:24:34,995
Some of the neighbors
just about lost everything.

364
00:24:36,562 --> 00:24:38,085
Don had a stroke.

365
00:24:40,087 --> 00:24:42,437
And Eileen,
she broke her hip,

366
00:24:42,611 --> 00:24:45,788
so I finally took out
a loan on the property
to help them out.

367
00:24:45,962 --> 00:24:49,444
Why would you do that
if you didn't even have
money for yourself?

368
00:24:50,271 --> 00:24:52,360
These people
are like family to me.

369
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:55,232
Ever since your grandfather
died, they have been
there for me.

370
00:24:55,406 --> 00:24:57,365
Checking in on me,

371
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:59,759
taking care of me,
and fixing thing up
around the ranch.

372
00:24:59,933 --> 00:25:02,022
And what about the horses?

373
00:25:03,153 --> 00:25:05,895
I had to sell them to stay
current with the loan.

374
00:25:06,069 --> 00:25:07,854
Just like that
you sold them?

375
00:25:08,855 --> 00:25:10,334
I did what I had to.

376
00:25:12,772 --> 00:25:15,818
So you're just going
to let the bank take
the ranch from you?

377
00:25:18,386 --> 00:25:19,387
Yes.

378
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:23,522
Can't those neighbors
help you?

379
00:25:23,696 --> 00:25:26,046
Can't Mom and Dad
help you at least?

380
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,396
There's got to be
a way, Grandma.

381
00:25:30,093 --> 00:25:31,878
I won't ask your parents.

382
00:25:32,052 --> 00:25:34,358
And I can't ask the neighbors,
they're still struggling.

383
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,839
Trying to keep
their own heads
above water.

384
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,059
I don't understand.

385
00:25:39,233 --> 00:25:40,974
The thing is,
nobody knows these farms

386
00:25:41,148 --> 00:25:44,020
like the people
that are already
farming the land.

387
00:25:44,194 --> 00:25:48,068
What really boils my bones
are those vultures,

388
00:25:48,242 --> 00:25:50,505
the bankers and the developers.
They're just sitting around

389
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:53,203
waiting for a late payment,
so they can snatch up
the property

390
00:25:53,377 --> 00:25:56,511
and knock down the barns,
get rid of all the animals...

391
00:25:58,774 --> 00:25:59,645
[sighs]

392
00:25:59,819 --> 00:26:01,429
...put up a subdivision.

393
00:26:01,603 --> 00:26:03,997
And that's what they
want to do with my ranch.

394
00:26:07,174 --> 00:26:09,176
Charles would be heartbroken.

395
00:26:11,308 --> 00:26:13,223
So you're just
going to give up?

396
00:26:14,921 --> 00:26:17,358
Well, that pony
was my last hope.

397
00:26:17,532 --> 00:26:21,014
I was going to train him
for show jumping,
win some competitions,

398
00:26:21,188 --> 00:26:24,060
sell him and get back
on top of things again.

399
00:26:24,234 --> 00:26:26,976
And now he's too weak,
and I'm too tired.

400
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,935
I don't have anymore time.

401
00:26:30,893 --> 00:26:32,547
So that's it then?

402
00:26:36,072 --> 00:26:38,379
We have this last Christmas
together, you and me.

403
00:26:39,946 --> 00:26:41,948
And I'm glad to spend it
here with you.

404
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:04,100
There was nobody
at the house, so I figured
I'd come down here.

405
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,363
What do you want?

406
00:27:06,537 --> 00:27:08,888
Well, uh, Mary said
you might need my help.

407
00:27:09,062 --> 00:27:12,108
-Did she?
-Yeah, I know
a lot about horses.

408
00:27:12,282 --> 00:27:15,285
Well, I got Hope eating again,
so I don't need you.

409
00:27:18,549 --> 00:27:19,550
Leave.

410
00:27:19,942 --> 00:27:21,117
Look,

411
00:27:21,291 --> 00:27:23,511
I'm sorry
I ate your dinner.

412
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:25,513
You know, it's hard
to say no to your grandma.

413
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:27,907
She asked me
to eat with her.

414
00:27:28,081 --> 00:27:30,083
All right? She's like
a family friend.

415
00:27:31,258 --> 00:27:33,913
-You're friends
with my grandma?
-Yeah.

416
00:27:34,087 --> 00:27:35,610
We've been neighbors
since I was born.

417
00:27:35,784 --> 00:27:37,264
She's pretty much
family to us.

418
00:27:37,438 --> 00:27:39,614
Did my grandma give
your family money?

419
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,268
Yeah.

420
00:27:41,442 --> 00:27:42,878
Last year after
the bad frost. Why?

421
00:27:43,052 --> 00:27:44,967
Then why don't you guys
just pay her back?

422
00:27:45,533 --> 00:27:47,622
What?

423
00:27:47,796 --> 00:27:49,276
My grandma doesn't have
enough money to keep
this place going,

424
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:51,582
and your family
owes her money.

425
00:27:51,757 --> 00:27:54,498
So, if you guys don't pay
her back, she is going
to lose this place.

426
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,413
I swear I didn't know.

427
00:27:56,587 --> 00:28:00,069
If my family could afford
that, to help her, we would,

428
00:28:00,243 --> 00:28:01,984
but I know we don't have
that kind of money.

429
00:28:02,158 --> 00:28:05,422
So my grandma is just
going to lose everything
and everyone

430
00:28:05,596 --> 00:28:07,250
while you guys just watch?

431
00:28:07,424 --> 00:28:09,252
I'm sorry,
I don't know what to do.

432
00:28:09,426 --> 00:28:10,950
Just leave.

433
00:28:26,356 --> 00:28:28,445
Wait.

434
00:28:28,619 --> 00:28:30,926
Do you know anything
about training horses
for show jumping?

435
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,929
I mean, me and my brother
used to ride in competitions
when I was younger.

436
00:28:34,103 --> 00:28:35,888
So, do you?

437
00:28:36,062 --> 00:28:38,151
-Well, yeah.
-Come with me.

438
00:28:46,855 --> 00:28:48,901
I don't want this
to be our last Christmas
here, Grandma.

439
00:28:49,075 --> 00:28:50,729
Oh, Lizzy,
sweetheart, I'm sorry.

440
00:28:50,903 --> 00:28:52,121
You can't lose this ranch.

441
00:28:52,295 --> 00:28:53,862
Well, what else
am I going to do?

442
00:28:54,036 --> 00:28:55,646
You have Hope.

443
00:28:55,821 --> 00:28:57,823
-Hope?
-Yes.

444
00:28:57,997 --> 00:29:00,739
I'm too tired, and I
don't have the time
to train a horse.

445
00:29:00,913 --> 00:29:03,176
-Well, I'm here now.
-And?

446
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,700
And I am going to train
him for show jumping,

447
00:29:05,874 --> 00:29:08,007
and we will win you
the money to save the ranch.

448
00:29:08,181 --> 00:29:12,402
Oh, sweetheart, you don't
know how to train a horse
for show jumping.

449
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:14,535
With James and a little
help from you, I will.

450
00:29:14,709 --> 00:29:17,364
You, you're serious?
You really want to do this?

451
00:29:17,538 --> 00:29:20,193
It takes a lot of time
and a lot of patience.

452
00:29:20,889 --> 00:29:21,760
I know.

453
00:29:21,934 --> 00:29:23,849
And I do want to do this.

454
00:29:24,023 --> 00:29:26,199
And you know
how stubborn I am.

455
00:29:26,982 --> 00:29:28,201
Yeah.

456
00:29:30,029 --> 00:29:31,508
What do we got to lose?

457
00:29:31,682 --> 00:29:33,336
Awesome. Come on.

458
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,555
Wha-

459
00:29:37,863 --> 00:29:38,864
Grandma's in.

460
00:29:39,516 --> 00:29:40,561
[door closes]

461
00:29:40,735 --> 00:29:42,650
Look at this place.

462
00:29:42,824 --> 00:29:44,347
There's no tree,
there's no lights,
there's no garland.

463
00:29:44,521 --> 00:29:46,785
This place looks
horrible for Christmas.

464
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:50,440
You need to go home,
get as many spare
decorations as you can.

465
00:29:50,614 --> 00:29:53,226
Visit other farms
if you have to,
and ask them for some, too.

466
00:29:54,705 --> 00:29:55,794
Go, now.

467
00:29:57,099 --> 00:29:59,232
Better do like she says.

468
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:04,019
And hurry up.
Hope's training starts now.

469
00:30:04,193 --> 00:30:05,673
I'm gonna go
change my shirt.

470
00:30:13,768 --> 00:30:15,901
Okay, the first thing
you're going to have
Hope do

471
00:30:16,075 --> 00:30:18,120
is walk over these poles.

472
00:30:18,294 --> 00:30:20,296
Now, he's got to walk
over them.

473
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:22,646
He's going to be
a little bit hesitant,
but that's your job.

474
00:30:23,082 --> 00:30:24,735
After that,

475
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:27,347
you will run over it,
and he will trot behind you.

476
00:30:27,521 --> 00:30:29,044
After a while,
he'll actually
like to do it.

477
00:30:29,218 --> 00:30:30,741
So, it's going to work
on his confidence,

478
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:32,613
his gait, and his rhythm.

479
00:30:32,787 --> 00:30:34,136
It's really important
for him to develop that, okay?

480
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:37,618
-Alright. What else?
-Over here.

481
00:30:37,792 --> 00:30:41,578
What happens here is these
two poles get put in the cups
on either side.

482
00:30:41,752 --> 00:30:42,797
It's called an X.

483
00:30:43,711 --> 00:30:45,669
Why don't you hold him
for a minute?

484
00:30:47,758 --> 00:30:50,022
So, one goes in this cup.
One in the other cup.

485
00:30:50,196 --> 00:30:54,069
Any pony can jump this,
but you gotta wait until
Hope gets stronger

486
00:30:54,243 --> 00:30:55,897
to handle the fences, okay?

487
00:30:56,071 --> 00:30:57,551
How long do you think
it will take him to do that?

488
00:30:57,725 --> 00:31:00,075
When he's ready,
but you can't push him.

489
00:31:00,249 --> 00:31:01,903
I don't want him
or you to get hurt.

490
00:31:02,077 --> 00:31:03,296
I'd never hurt Hope.

491
00:31:04,471 --> 00:31:05,864
I know you wouldn't hurt him.

492
00:31:06,995 --> 00:31:09,128
You just have to be careful.

493
00:31:09,302 --> 00:31:10,999
I know my parents think
I'm a total screw-up

494
00:31:11,173 --> 00:31:12,827
that doesn't care
about anything or anybody,

495
00:31:13,001 --> 00:31:16,657
but I'm in this, Grandma.
I'm not gonna screw it up.

496
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,833
I know I can do this.

497
00:31:20,313 --> 00:31:21,488
I believe you can.

498
00:31:21,662 --> 00:31:23,272
-Ready to get started?
-Yeah.

499
00:31:23,446 --> 00:31:24,839
Come on.

500
00:31:25,013 --> 00:31:26,536
[Mary] Come on, boy.
[clicks tongue]

501
00:32:20,025 --> 00:32:21,374
[Lizzy]
What do you got for us?

502
00:32:21,548 --> 00:32:23,376
This is all the stuff
my parents aren't using.

503
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:26,161
Your leftovers?

504
00:32:26,335 --> 00:32:27,858
Well, it's all
still good stuff.

505
00:32:28,033 --> 00:32:29,556
Here, let's take a look.

506
00:32:30,992 --> 00:32:32,559
Okay.

507
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,215
[James]
What do you think?

508
00:32:36,389 --> 00:32:38,913
[Lizzy]
Good enough, I guess.

509
00:32:39,087 --> 00:32:40,567
Go ahead and take them on up
to the house, then come back
out and help me with Hope.

510
00:32:40,741 --> 00:32:41,960
We'll be back
in later, Grandma.

511
00:32:42,134 --> 00:32:43,787
[clicks tongue]
Come on.

512
00:32:44,701 --> 00:32:47,443
-[zipper rasps]
-Oh, that girl.

513
00:32:47,617 --> 00:32:49,750
Well, guess I've got
my work cut out for me
this afternoon.

514
00:32:49,924 --> 00:32:51,839
I haven't put up decorations
in a long time.

515
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:55,843
-How come?
-Kinda lost the enthusiasm
once Charles died.

516
00:32:56,017 --> 00:32:58,193
I mean, you don't have
to decorate if you
don't want to.

517
00:32:58,367 --> 00:33:00,500
No, it's for Lizzy.

518
00:33:00,674 --> 00:33:02,110
[Lizzy]
Yeah. Good boy.

519
00:33:02,284 --> 00:33:05,766
How come her parents
brought her here?

520
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:08,334
Just getting into a
little trouble at home.

521
00:33:08,508 --> 00:33:10,118
She doesn't seem
that bad to me.

522
00:33:10,292 --> 00:33:13,121
Well, no,
I don't think she is.

523
00:33:13,295 --> 00:33:16,037
Why don't you go help her?
I'll take this up to the house.

524
00:33:16,211 --> 00:33:18,300
Maybe even
take a little nap.

525
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,313
[both groan]

526
00:33:32,575 --> 00:33:35,317
-He worked
really hard today.
-Yeah.

527
00:33:35,491 --> 00:33:37,102
He's getting
a lot stronger, too.

528
00:33:37,276 --> 00:33:38,842
Yeah.

529
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,628
I think I'm going to have
him run the Xs tomorrow.

530
00:33:44,152 --> 00:33:47,329
When did you find out
you were coming here
to your grandma's?

531
00:33:47,503 --> 00:33:48,896
A couple days ago.

532
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,811
Do you like it here?

533
00:33:50,985 --> 00:33:53,727
I mean, it, like, must be
so different than the city.

534
00:33:53,901 --> 00:33:55,033
Yeah. [chuckles]

535
00:33:56,512 --> 00:33:58,688
Do you feel different
out here?

536
00:33:58,862 --> 00:34:00,908
What do you mean?

537
00:34:01,082 --> 00:34:03,041
Out in the country,
like, does it make
you feel different?

538
00:34:03,215 --> 00:34:05,652
I mean Mary told me that
your parents brought you here

539
00:34:05,826 --> 00:34:07,915
because of something
bad you did.

540
00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:09,482
And? [sighs]

541
00:34:10,135 --> 00:34:11,310
I don't know.

542
00:34:11,484 --> 00:34:13,007
You don't seem
so bad to me.

543
00:34:13,616 --> 00:34:14,704
Why not?

544
00:34:15,966 --> 00:34:18,012
I don't know. I guess
I just don't believe it.

545
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:20,449
Well, you should.

546
00:34:20,623 --> 00:34:23,017
You don't know me,
so don't act like you do.

547
00:34:24,888 --> 00:34:26,325
What'd you do?

548
00:34:28,631 --> 00:34:31,199
I got in trouble with
a couple of my friends.

549
00:34:31,373 --> 00:34:32,287
It was an accident.

550
00:34:32,461 --> 00:34:34,507
It was stupid.

551
00:34:34,681 --> 00:34:37,292
We had a couple of drinks,
and we all fell asleep.

552
00:34:37,466 --> 00:34:42,558
The curtains must have caught
on fire, because I woke up
to flames and screaming.

553
00:34:43,385 --> 00:34:45,300
Was anybody hurt?

554
00:34:45,474 --> 00:34:46,867
We were all
rushed to the hospital

555
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:49,348
because of all the smoke
we were breathing in.

556
00:34:49,522 --> 00:34:51,045
It was pretty bad.

557
00:34:52,307 --> 00:34:53,917
Your parents
must have freaked.

558
00:34:55,005 --> 00:34:56,398
Yeah.

559
00:34:56,572 --> 00:34:58,096
What about your house?

560
00:34:58,748 --> 00:35:00,141
It's fine.

561
00:35:00,315 --> 00:35:01,708
The firefighters
got there in time,

562
00:35:01,882 --> 00:35:03,840
so only the living room
was ruined.

563
00:35:04,363 --> 00:35:05,538
Wow.

564
00:35:06,278 --> 00:35:07,714
Yeah.

565
00:35:07,888 --> 00:35:09,933
So, that's why
they brought you here?

566
00:35:11,065 --> 00:35:13,981
They're never going
to trust me again.

567
00:35:14,155 --> 00:35:16,592
But it was just an accident.

568
00:35:16,766 --> 00:35:20,770
Yeah, it was, but they're also
mad at me for my grades.

569
00:35:20,944 --> 00:35:22,946
Oh, are you doing bad
in school?

570
00:35:23,382 --> 00:35:25,079
Yeah. [laughing]

571
00:35:25,558 --> 00:35:27,081
I got suspended.

572
00:35:27,734 --> 00:35:29,910
Hmm. Why?

573
00:35:30,084 --> 00:35:32,652
I skipped too much.

574
00:35:32,826 --> 00:35:35,350
But my parents didn't notice
until the principal called

575
00:35:35,524 --> 00:35:37,613
to tell them
that I got suspended.

576
00:35:38,484 --> 00:35:40,050
I've never
even had a detention.

577
00:35:40,225 --> 00:35:42,662
Well, good for you.

578
00:35:42,836 --> 00:35:46,622
My parents had me
on lockdown for a week
after I was suspended.

579
00:35:46,796 --> 00:35:48,711
That's when the fire happened.

580
00:35:48,885 --> 00:35:51,497
So, that's why
they brought you here.

581
00:35:52,585 --> 00:35:54,543
It was stupid, I get that,

582
00:35:55,196 --> 00:35:57,024
I'm not a bad kid.

583
00:35:58,721 --> 00:36:01,028
And I hate that
they think I am.

584
00:36:02,725 --> 00:36:04,945
They're never going
to trust me again.

585
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,470
They always look so sad
when they look at me now.

586
00:36:08,644 --> 00:36:10,864
Well, you can't be
all that bad.

587
00:36:11,038 --> 00:36:12,779
Hope still trusts you.

588
00:36:14,041 --> 00:36:15,042
Yeah.

589
00:36:16,086 --> 00:36:17,610
I know.

590
00:36:17,784 --> 00:36:19,655
That's why
I can't let him down.

591
00:36:29,404 --> 00:36:30,840
You made this for me?

592
00:36:31,014 --> 00:36:32,320
Yeah.

593
00:36:32,494 --> 00:36:34,192
It was a gift for you.

594
00:36:34,801 --> 00:36:36,890
Your grandma asked me to.

595
00:36:39,022 --> 00:36:40,154
Thanks.

596
00:36:55,256 --> 00:36:56,301
Wow.

597
00:36:56,475 --> 00:36:57,432
What do you think?

598
00:36:57,606 --> 00:36:59,086
It looks great.

599
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,175
I was hoping
to surprise you.

600
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:02,655
Forgot what a chore
this was.

601
00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:04,744
It's a lot of hard work.

602
00:37:04,918 --> 00:37:09,531
It's been a lot of years
since I did all this
Christmas decorating.

603
00:37:11,664 --> 00:37:13,753
I like being here
for Christmas.

604
00:37:13,927 --> 00:37:16,190
I like having you
here for Christmas.

605
00:37:18,671 --> 00:37:20,281
Hope's training
is going really well.

606
00:37:20,455 --> 00:37:23,023
Yeah? I think you're doing
a great job with him.

607
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,677
Thanks.

608
00:37:25,547 --> 00:37:27,245
Okay, I think
that's about it.

609
00:37:27,941 --> 00:37:29,725
[groans]

610
00:37:29,899 --> 00:37:31,858
Could you help me
with this box over here?

611
00:37:32,511 --> 00:37:33,686
Sure.

612
00:37:37,864 --> 00:37:40,954
This place is starting
to look pretty incredible.

613
00:37:41,128 --> 00:37:42,521
It is.

614
00:37:42,695 --> 00:37:44,566
You know, when
your dad was little,

615
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,351
Grandpa Charles
used to decorate,
for every holiday,

616
00:37:46,525 --> 00:37:48,570
every single room
in this ranch.

617
00:37:49,484 --> 00:37:51,356
And then he got sick,

618
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:54,228
and it became
more of a chore,
so I kind of stopped.

619
00:37:54,837 --> 00:37:56,230
How long has it been?

620
00:37:56,709 --> 00:37:58,232
Since he passed?

621
00:37:59,364 --> 00:38:01,061
It's been eight years.

622
00:38:02,454 --> 00:38:03,759
Time flies.

623
00:38:03,933 --> 00:38:05,718
Do you think
about him a lot?

624
00:38:05,892 --> 00:38:08,895
Sometimes, I do.
Other times, not as much.

625
00:38:09,461 --> 00:38:11,201
I tell you, when he died,

626
00:38:11,376 --> 00:38:13,856
I sure was mad
at God at first.

627
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,336
But not anymore?

628
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,859
No.

629
00:38:17,033 --> 00:38:18,861
I forgave him.

630
00:38:19,035 --> 00:38:20,733
Besides, I know I'm going
to see Charles again one day.

631
00:38:20,907 --> 00:38:23,692
And I've got so much to be
grateful for right here.

632
00:38:24,214 --> 00:38:25,303
[clattering]

633
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:29,350
Grandma, I'm not going
to be able to give you

634
00:38:29,524 --> 00:38:31,439
a present for Christmas
this year.

635
00:38:31,613 --> 00:38:33,485
That's okay, sweety.

636
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:35,661
I was in such a bad mood
when I left,

637
00:38:35,835 --> 00:38:38,620
I didn't think about getting
anything for anybody.

638
00:38:39,752 --> 00:38:41,188
I tell you what,

639
00:38:41,362 --> 00:38:43,364
you get Hope fit
and healthy

640
00:38:43,538 --> 00:38:46,106
and that will be the
best Christmas present
you could give me.

641
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,890
-Okay?
-Okay.

642
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,631
[softly] Okay.

643
00:38:58,423 --> 00:38:59,772
Amen.

644
00:39:02,296 --> 00:39:03,645
Well, I'm pooped.

645
00:39:03,819 --> 00:39:05,212
I couldn't pick up
another ornament.

646
00:39:05,386 --> 00:39:06,561
Thanks for your help today.

647
00:39:06,735 --> 00:39:08,650
Yeah. It was fun.

648
00:39:09,782 --> 00:39:11,349
You must be tired, too.

649
00:39:11,523 --> 00:39:13,133
I don't know who's working
harder, you or Hope.

650
00:39:13,481 --> 00:39:14,656
Oh, no.

651
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:16,702
It's so much fun for me.
I love him.

652
00:39:20,183 --> 00:39:22,664
So, have you heard
from your parents lately?

653
00:39:24,884 --> 00:39:26,059
Have you called them?

654
00:39:27,452 --> 00:39:28,714
No.

655
00:39:29,976 --> 00:39:31,020
Why not?

656
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,632
I don't see the point.

657
00:39:33,806 --> 00:39:35,895
Have they tried
to call you?

658
00:39:36,722 --> 00:39:38,332
I don't know.

659
00:39:38,506 --> 00:39:40,465
I haven't checked my phone
because it's been off.

660
00:39:43,424 --> 00:39:45,339
What if they're trying
to get ahold of you?

661
00:39:46,819 --> 00:39:49,387
I don't want
to talk to them.

662
00:39:49,561 --> 00:39:51,737
Besides, they dumped me here
for Christmas anyway, so they
don't have to talk to me.

663
00:39:51,911 --> 00:39:54,522
-That's not true.
-Then why?

664
00:39:54,696 --> 00:39:56,481
Because they were
worried about you.

665
00:39:57,046 --> 00:39:58,178
Whatever.

666
00:40:01,616 --> 00:40:02,922
You know, Lizzy,

667
00:40:03,096 --> 00:40:05,881
if you can handle
raising a horse,

668
00:40:06,055 --> 00:40:08,362
I think you can
handle a phone call.

669
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:17,023
Can I go now?

670
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,473
Hey, boy.

671
00:40:32,647 --> 00:40:34,083
I missed you, too.
[chuckles]

672
00:40:36,172 --> 00:40:37,565
All right.

673
00:40:37,739 --> 00:40:40,046
Let's get you out and do
some training today.

674
00:40:52,058 --> 00:40:54,103
Did you have
a good night's sleep, Hope?

675
00:40:56,715 --> 00:40:58,325
[chuckles]

676
00:40:58,499 --> 00:41:00,458
I'm hoping you at least did.
Seems like you did.

677
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:10,337
Grandma's mad at me
for me not wanting to call
my parents last night.

678
00:41:10,511 --> 00:41:13,296
I don't see why I should.
I've got nothing
to say to them.

679
00:41:16,212 --> 00:41:17,823
Hey, not cool.

680
00:41:20,173 --> 00:41:22,088
Did you know
your mom and dad, Hope?

681
00:41:25,657 --> 00:41:27,746
I bet they were
great show jumpers.

682
00:41:29,704 --> 00:41:33,491
And I bet Grandma knew
them. she trained them
into something great.

683
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:37,451
Yeah.

684
00:41:40,062 --> 00:41:42,717
You can trust me, Hope.

685
00:41:42,891 --> 00:41:45,111
You're going to be
something great, too.

686
00:41:47,722 --> 00:41:49,202
All right,
here's your carrot.

And to think, when I
first got here, you could
barely walk.

715
00:43:34,133 --> 00:43:36,222
You're gonna save

[door opens]

718
00:43:56,155 --> 00:43:57,765
-Hi, Mary.
-Hi, James.

719
00:43:57,939 --> 00:43:59,593
Brought more Christmas
decorations.

720
00:43:59,767 --> 00:44:01,029
Careful, thank you.

721
00:44:01,203 --> 00:44:02,422
Want me to
just leave them here?

722
00:44:02,596 --> 00:44:04,250
That's a good place.

723
00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:06,382
What are you making?

724
00:44:06,556 --> 00:44:09,603
-Christmas Chocolate Pecan Pie.
-Oh, yum.

725
00:44:10,386 --> 00:44:12,301
Is it, um,

726
00:44:12,475 --> 00:44:13,912
is it hard to make pies?

727
00:44:14,913 --> 00:44:17,089
-Not too hard.
-No?

728
00:44:19,482 --> 00:44:21,833
Are you gonna ask me
where Lizzy is?

729
00:44:22,007 --> 00:44:23,443
What? No!

730
00:44:23,617 --> 00:44:25,445
I was just bringing
more decorations by.

731
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:28,927
Just in case you're curious,
she may be in the barn.

732
00:44:29,101 --> 00:44:31,625
Oh, I should have known
she'd be with Hope.

733
00:44:31,799 --> 00:44:32,974
Mm-hmm.

734
00:44:33,714 --> 00:44:35,455
Dinner's at 6:00.

735
00:44:35,629 --> 00:44:37,413
Yeah? Ah, what are we eating?

736
00:44:37,587 --> 00:44:39,981
James, you came here
to see Lizzy, right?

737
00:44:40,765 --> 00:44:42,157
Go. See her.

738
00:44:43,463 --> 00:44:45,291
-[chuckles]
-Don't be late.

739
00:44:51,514 --> 00:44:52,777
-Hey, Lizzy.
-Shh!

740
00:44:52,951 --> 00:44:54,387
Hope's resting.

741
00:44:54,561 --> 00:44:56,694
-Another hard day
of training?
-Yeah.

742
00:45:06,138 --> 00:45:07,705
I could get used to this.

743
00:45:08,662 --> 00:45:10,142
You mean the ranch?

744
00:45:11,186 --> 00:45:13,145
I've lived on a farm
my whole life.

745
00:45:13,623 --> 00:45:15,669
-Really?
-Yeah.

746
00:45:15,843 --> 00:45:18,367
I want to go to college
in the city, but Dad
won't let me go.

747
00:45:18,803 --> 00:45:20,239
Why not?

748
00:45:20,413 --> 00:45:22,676
Well, he wants me
to help run the farm.

749
00:45:23,851 --> 00:45:24,765
And you don't want to?

750
00:45:24,939 --> 00:45:26,332
Not really.

751
00:45:26,506 --> 00:45:29,030
But I don't really
have a choice.

752
00:45:29,204 --> 00:45:30,902
I'm the only one
left at home.

753
00:45:31,076 --> 00:45:34,166
-Oh, you're an only kid too?
-No, no.

754
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,690
My older sister, Samantha,

755
00:45:36,864 --> 00:45:40,520
about two years ago,
she eloped with some guy
from California

756
00:45:40,694 --> 00:45:42,522
and they ran off together.

757
00:45:42,696 --> 00:45:44,698
So she doesn't
talk to us anymore.

758
00:45:44,872 --> 00:45:46,265
Uh-huh.

759
00:45:46,439 --> 00:45:49,442
Then my brother, Zach,
joined the Navy.

760
00:45:50,922 --> 00:45:52,053
I want to go visit him.

761
00:45:52,227 --> 00:45:53,968
-But you can't?
-No.

762
00:45:54,142 --> 00:45:56,449
We don't have
that kind of money.

763
00:45:56,623 --> 00:45:59,713
So, Dad wants me to
help take over the farm.

764
00:46:02,977 --> 00:46:04,587
Well,

765
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:07,373
if you could go to school,
what would you study?

766
00:46:09,723 --> 00:46:13,248
My mom always says that
I'd do great at an art school.

767
00:46:13,422 --> 00:46:16,034
-Really? Art? [laughs]
-Yeah.

768
00:46:16,208 --> 00:46:20,125
She thinks I've got talent,
but I'm not so sure.

769
00:46:20,299 --> 00:46:21,779
No, you do have talent.

770
00:46:21,953 --> 00:46:23,258
You made me that horse.
It was beautiful.

771
00:46:23,432 --> 00:46:25,870
Nah, that... that's easy.

772
00:46:26,044 --> 00:46:27,741
Besides, that's not real art.

773
00:46:27,915 --> 00:46:30,657
I mean, I can't draw or paint
that well or anything.

774
00:46:30,831 --> 00:46:32,572
Well, I think it's real art.

775
00:46:33,703 --> 00:46:35,836
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

776
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:38,491
You know, I've got, like,
probably about 100
more of those at home.

777
00:46:38,665 --> 00:46:41,842
You should really start
showing people those.

778
00:46:42,016 --> 00:46:43,539
I know they'd
think it's art too.

779
00:46:43,713 --> 00:46:45,846
You should definitely
look into selling them.

780
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:47,630
-You think so?
-Yeah.

781
00:46:49,241 --> 00:46:51,156
I'll think about it.

782
00:46:54,289 --> 00:46:55,813
I just love this view.

783
00:46:56,552 --> 00:46:57,597
Yeah.

784
00:47:11,219 --> 00:47:13,004
Hey, I need to see
how Hope's doing.

785
00:47:13,178 --> 00:47:14,614
I just put him up.

786
00:47:14,788 --> 00:47:17,138
I need to see how
he is progressing now.

787
00:47:17,312 --> 00:47:18,618
But he's resting.

788
00:47:19,488 --> 00:47:20,620
Let's go.

789
00:47:25,146 --> 00:47:26,495
[Mary sighs]

790
00:47:27,105 --> 00:47:28,758
I know you worked hard.

791
00:47:28,933 --> 00:47:30,630
You still got more work to do.

792
00:47:33,328 --> 00:47:36,549
I may have to put Hope
on the training circuit
sooner than I thought.

793
00:47:36,723 --> 00:47:38,638
I'm not gonna rush him.

794
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,815
Let's get him out.

795
00:47:45,775 --> 00:47:47,299
Is everything okay?

796
00:47:48,126 --> 00:47:50,302
I don't know.

797
00:47:50,476 --> 00:47:53,827
I got a call from the bank,
and I just have
to see how he's doing.

798
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:01,226
[Lizzy] Okay.

799
00:48:01,704 --> 00:48:02,880
Yeah, good boy.

800
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,371
[panting]

801
00:48:16,545 --> 00:48:18,896
-See how strong he's gotten?
-Yeah, you're looking great.

802
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:20,680
He's looking great.

803
00:48:20,854 --> 00:48:22,812
He's not sick at all
anymore, are you, boy?

804
00:48:24,205 --> 00:48:26,338
I need to see him
tackle that fence.

805
00:48:26,512 --> 00:48:28,862
I don't want to rush him.

806
00:48:29,036 --> 00:48:31,082
Lizzy if you want me to keep
the ranch, he's got to be
able to handle that.

807
00:48:31,256 --> 00:48:32,779
Yeah, don't worry, Lizzy.

808
00:48:32,953 --> 00:48:34,346
That's what all
this training has been for.

809
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:38,785
Okay, boy.

810
00:48:39,699 --> 00:48:40,830
[clicks tongue]

811
00:48:41,005 --> 00:48:42,528
This is it.

812
00:49:06,856 --> 00:49:08,510
[Lizzy] Good job!

813
00:49:08,684 --> 00:49:09,772
Good job, boy.

814
00:49:10,295 --> 00:49:11,731
You did it.

815
00:49:11,905 --> 00:49:12,906
Whoa.

816
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,386
[panting]

817
00:49:15,648 --> 00:49:17,215
Good job.

818
00:49:17,389 --> 00:49:19,347
[Mary] You've done such
a great job with him.

819
00:49:19,521 --> 00:49:21,219
I couldn't have
done better myself.

820
00:49:21,567 --> 00:49:22,568
Really?

821
00:49:24,222 --> 00:49:25,658
Yeah, seriously.

822
00:49:32,447 --> 00:49:33,927
So what happens now?

823
00:49:34,101 --> 00:49:35,363
You keep training him.

824
00:49:35,537 --> 00:49:38,018
He's not quite ready
to compete.

825
00:49:38,192 --> 00:49:40,803
And in the meantime, I'm
going to start looking up some
show jumping competitions

826
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:42,936
to enter him into
at the beginning of the year.

827
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:46,331
-He's not too young?
-No.

828
00:49:46,505 --> 00:49:49,812
He's just going to be
competing against other ponies
his age, he'll be fine.

829
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:51,075
Good.

830
00:49:56,471 --> 00:49:59,213
I want to stay here until
he's done with training.

831
00:49:59,387 --> 00:50:00,736
Here on the ranch?

832
00:50:01,215 --> 00:50:02,434
Yeah.

833
00:50:03,261 --> 00:50:05,002
I would love that.

834
00:50:05,741 --> 00:50:07,526
[laughing]

835
00:50:23,542 --> 00:50:26,371
-I hope you're both hungry.
-I know I am.

836
00:50:28,242 --> 00:50:30,027
Lizzy?

837
00:50:30,201 --> 00:50:32,768
There's a woman with a group
of people down at the barn.

838
00:50:32,942 --> 00:50:34,031
What?

839
00:50:36,859 --> 00:50:39,297
[door opens, closes]

840
00:50:49,568 --> 00:50:52,527
What are you doing here?
This is private property.

841
00:50:52,701 --> 00:50:56,575
If you'd like to take
a step inside, go ahead on in.

842
00:50:56,749 --> 00:50:59,317
Mrs. Evans, I don't know
if you remember me.
I'm Erin Cooper.

843
00:50:59,491 --> 00:51:01,710
-Yeah, from the bank.
-Yes.

844
00:51:01,884 --> 00:51:03,625
Who are those people?
What are you doing here?

845
00:51:03,799 --> 00:51:05,845
-They're here
to see the ranch.
-What for?

846
00:51:06,019 --> 00:51:09,109
-We're choosing a realtor
to list the property.
-What?

847
00:51:09,283 --> 00:51:10,893
Mrs. Evans, the bank
has been more than fair.

848
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:12,852
You haven't made a payment
in six months.

849
00:51:13,026 --> 00:51:16,638
I had some unexpected
expenses, but I am working

850
00:51:16,812 --> 00:51:18,771
on rebuilding right now.
I have a show pony.

851
00:51:18,945 --> 00:51:20,860
This ranch is the only
reason that the bank gave you

852
00:51:21,034 --> 00:51:23,123
this loan of this magnitude
in the first place.

853
00:51:23,297 --> 00:51:25,952
I'm sorry that you're
having personal difficulties.

854
00:51:28,302 --> 00:51:30,913
Okay, so now what?

855
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:34,047
Now the bank sets out to
search for a new owner for the
ranch and its surrounding land.

856
00:51:34,221 --> 00:51:36,615
You can't do that.
This is my ranch.
It's my home.

857
00:51:36,789 --> 00:51:39,618
Actually, we can,
and we are.

858
00:51:39,792 --> 00:51:42,011
You signed a note.
You're six months delinquent.

859
00:51:42,186 --> 00:51:44,188
The bank is merely trying
to get back its investment.

860
00:51:44,362 --> 00:51:46,103
I'm sorry,
it's just business.

861
00:51:46,277 --> 00:51:47,843
Business?

862
00:51:48,017 --> 00:51:50,803
No, this is my life.

863
00:51:50,977 --> 00:51:54,937
You were warned that failure
to pay would result in loss
of property.

864
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:57,940
I just need a little bit
more time to get him
into the competition,

865
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:02,380
and get him trained,
and then I will be current
on the loan payments.

866
00:52:02,554 --> 00:52:03,946
There is no more time.

867
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:06,558
But the show season
starts in a month.

868
00:52:07,298 --> 00:52:09,691
If you can begin
to make payments

869
00:52:09,865 --> 00:52:13,042
for the debt that you owe,
in a manner that will
satisfy the bank,

870
00:52:13,217 --> 00:52:16,220
you'll get more time to
get current on your loan.

871
00:52:16,394 --> 00:52:18,744
And what manner
would that be?

872
00:52:18,918 --> 00:52:22,095
A slight bump
to $3,500 a month.

873
00:52:22,922 --> 00:52:24,967
Okay. Okay.

874
00:52:26,404 --> 00:52:28,101
Your next payment
is on the 24th.

875
00:52:29,842 --> 00:52:31,104
Of December?

876
00:52:31,278 --> 00:52:33,759
-That's in a few days.
-I know.

877
00:52:34,238 --> 00:52:35,717
On Christmas Eve?

878
00:52:35,891 --> 00:52:38,285
The bank is open
till one o'clock.

879
00:52:38,459 --> 00:52:42,159
Look, it's simple.
Make the payments
or we foreclose.

880
00:52:57,086 --> 00:52:58,131
[door closes]

881
00:52:59,437 --> 00:53:00,960
Who were they?

882
00:53:10,796 --> 00:53:15,017
It was a banker with...
a bunch of realtors.

883
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:16,715
What were they doing here?

884
00:53:18,282 --> 00:53:20,153
They came to look
at the ranch.

885
00:53:21,937 --> 00:53:24,810
She wants me to make
a payment by Monday.

886
00:53:28,596 --> 00:53:30,163
I think it's over.

887
00:53:30,816 --> 00:53:32,513
No.

888
00:53:32,687 --> 00:53:35,124
You said I had enough time
to finish training Hope.

889
00:53:35,299 --> 00:53:37,692
I thought I'd have at least
a couple more months.

890
00:53:37,866 --> 00:53:40,260
They have to give you more
time. Hope's almost ready.

891
00:53:41,305 --> 00:53:42,871
They don't care about that.

892
00:53:43,698 --> 00:53:46,484
They want $3,500.

893
00:53:46,658 --> 00:53:48,747
On Christmas Eve.

894
00:53:48,921 --> 00:53:51,184
Then just give them the money.
Pay them.

895
00:53:52,403 --> 00:53:54,753
I don't have that much money.

896
00:53:54,927 --> 00:53:56,668
This is stupid.

897
00:53:56,842 --> 00:53:58,974
What if there was a horse show
between now and then?

898
00:53:59,148 --> 00:54:00,715
We could win the money.

899
00:54:00,889 --> 00:54:01,934
By Monday?

900
00:54:03,762 --> 00:54:07,896
There's no shows
until the New year.

901
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:09,985
So, what are you going to do?
Just give up, and sit back,

902
00:54:10,159 --> 00:54:12,161
and watch them take
the ranch from you?

903
00:54:12,336 --> 00:54:13,815
What else can I do!

904
00:54:13,989 --> 00:54:15,339
I am not going
to lose this ranch!

905
00:54:15,513 --> 00:54:17,210
I refuse to let that happen!

906
00:54:18,429 --> 00:54:19,952
Lizzy, please!

907
00:54:20,996 --> 00:54:22,346
[door closes]

908
00:54:29,004 --> 00:54:30,267
Go.

909
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:32,573
See if she's okay.

910
00:55:00,209 --> 00:55:01,515
Are you alright, Lizzy?

911
00:55:01,689 --> 00:55:03,561
Would you just
leave me alone!

912
00:55:04,997 --> 00:55:07,173
I wish I never came
to this place.

913
00:55:07,347 --> 00:55:09,480
Hey, it's going to be okay.

914
00:55:09,654 --> 00:55:12,178
Don't say that
it's going to be okay.
Nothing is going to be okay.

915
00:55:12,352 --> 00:55:15,399
All this is going
to be gone, and it's partly
your family's fault!

916
00:55:15,573 --> 00:55:18,097
Your pathetic, poor family!

917
00:55:20,055 --> 00:55:22,754
No wonder
your stupid siblings left.

918
00:55:24,886 --> 00:55:26,888
[sobs]

919
00:55:27,062 --> 00:55:29,935
I just want to
leave this place. [sobbing]

920
00:55:32,807 --> 00:55:35,288
Would you think about
someone else for a change?

921
00:55:35,984 --> 00:55:37,246
What?

922
00:55:37,421 --> 00:55:38,813
All you care about
is yourself.

923
00:55:38,987 --> 00:55:41,120
How do you think Mary feels?

924
00:55:41,729 --> 00:55:43,383
How do you think I feel?

925
00:55:43,557 --> 00:55:46,430
Okay, yeah, I know my family
is partly responsible.

926
00:55:46,604 --> 00:55:48,780
I can't help that.
I wish I could.

927
00:55:48,954 --> 00:55:51,826
You don't even realize
how mean you're being!

928
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,263
We were becoming
good friends.

929
00:55:54,438 --> 00:55:57,092
You were finally starting to
get along with your grandma.

930
00:55:57,266 --> 00:55:58,920
And now, because of,

931
00:55:59,094 --> 00:56:02,141
because of your temper,
you're ruining everything.

932
00:56:04,796 --> 00:56:06,972
I was happy here.

933
00:56:08,452 --> 00:56:11,585
I was bringing
Hope back to life
and saving this ranch.

934
00:56:11,759 --> 00:56:13,195
But now...

935
00:56:14,327 --> 00:56:16,068
Now what?

936
00:56:16,242 --> 00:56:20,986
Now that your plan
to redeem yourself is over?

937
00:56:21,552 --> 00:56:23,554
What are you gonna do?

938
00:56:23,728 --> 00:56:26,165
Your grandma is in there
right now,

939
00:56:26,644 --> 00:56:28,080
alone.

940
00:56:28,254 --> 00:56:31,300
She's having to deal
with this by herself

941
00:56:31,475 --> 00:56:33,041
because you're in here.

942
00:56:34,478 --> 00:56:36,044
Just go be with her.

943
00:56:37,785 --> 00:56:39,483
Just go home, James!

944
00:56:39,657 --> 00:56:41,180
I never want to see you again!

945
00:56:44,139 --> 00:56:45,358
I'm gone, Lizzy.

946
00:56:45,663 --> 00:56:46,794
Good.

947
00:56:47,447 --> 00:56:48,840
[sobbing]

948
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,200
James?

949
00:57:01,374 --> 00:57:03,245
I'm sorry, I can't stay
for dinner, Mary.

950
00:57:03,898 --> 00:57:05,247
Well, how's Lizzy?

951
00:57:30,185 --> 00:57:31,186
Lizzy?

952
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:32,797
Are you back there?

953
00:57:43,372 --> 00:57:44,765
I'm so sorry.

954
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:56,995
What's going
to happen to Hope?

955
00:57:59,214 --> 00:58:00,172
I don't know.

956
00:58:03,349 --> 00:58:05,482
I just don't know.

957
00:58:07,048 --> 00:58:08,963
You're going to get
rid of him, aren't you?

958
00:58:09,573 --> 00:58:11,096
You don't understand.

959
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:14,273
It's not that simple.

960
00:58:15,535 --> 00:58:17,624
This ranch

961
00:58:17,798 --> 00:58:23,456
and these horses
have been my whole life.

962
00:58:26,851 --> 00:58:28,592
And when your grandpa died,

963
00:58:30,289 --> 00:58:33,945
I had to make
some really hard decisions.

964
00:58:38,689 --> 00:58:40,299
I don't regret it.

965
00:58:42,257 --> 00:58:44,129
I'd still do it
all over again.

966
00:58:44,303 --> 00:58:47,480
How can you say that?
It cost you everything.

967
00:58:47,654 --> 00:58:49,613
It cost me a lot.

968
00:58:52,311 --> 00:58:56,794
But I helped some very dear
friends save their farms...

969
00:58:57,838 --> 00:58:59,144
and it's only money.

970
00:59:00,145 --> 00:59:03,670
Yeah, but you ended up
screwing yourself over

971
00:59:03,844 --> 00:59:06,281
and all of your horses,
including Hope.

972
00:59:06,804 --> 00:59:07,979
No.

973
00:59:08,153 --> 00:59:11,809
I took care of my horses,

974
00:59:12,679 --> 00:59:14,812
and I'll take care of Hope.

975
00:59:14,986 --> 00:59:17,205
If I have to find him
a home, I will.

976
00:59:17,379 --> 00:59:18,424
You mean sell him?

977
00:59:21,601 --> 00:59:22,559
Maybe.

978
00:59:23,995 --> 00:59:25,387
But I don't want you to.

979
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,389
I don't want anybody
else to have him.

980
00:59:29,348 --> 00:59:31,611
I don't have too many
options left, Lizzy.

981
00:59:31,785 --> 00:59:34,005
What else am I supposed to do?

982
00:59:36,703 --> 00:59:38,183
I can't lose him.

983
00:59:40,315 --> 00:59:41,403
[sighs]

984
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:43,318
It's not the end
of the world.

985
00:59:43,492 --> 00:59:44,581
Life goes on.

986
00:59:45,669 --> 00:59:47,018
Whatever.

987
00:59:51,936 --> 00:59:53,546
I'm going inside now.

988
00:59:54,721 --> 00:59:56,201
I don't care where you go.

989
00:59:58,377 --> 01:00:01,467
Lot of things to think about.
A lot of decisions to be made.

990
01:00:03,208 --> 01:00:05,036
Come inside when you're ready.

991
01:00:33,064 --> 01:00:35,936
[Mary]
Yeah, everything.

992
01:00:36,110 --> 01:00:39,113
No, no, it's all for sale,
whatever you want.

993
01:00:40,114 --> 01:00:41,681
Oh, you're helping me out.

994
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:42,987
Mm-hmm.

995
01:00:43,161 --> 01:00:44,815
So, this afternoon?

996
01:00:44,989 --> 01:00:47,034
That'll be great.
First come first serve.

997
01:00:47,905 --> 01:00:50,081
Give Beth and Mac
a call too for me?

998
01:00:50,951 --> 01:00:53,084
Alright, appreciate it.
Thanks.

999
01:00:53,693 --> 01:00:54,651
Bye.

1000
01:02:33,271 --> 01:02:34,359
Grandma!

1001
01:02:34,533 --> 01:02:36,143
Grandma! Grandma,

1002
01:02:36,317 --> 01:02:37,928
I know what to do.
I know how to save the ranch.

1003
01:02:38,102 --> 01:02:39,364
-I'm already making--
-No, Grandma, listen to me.

1004
01:02:39,538 --> 01:02:41,366
-You have to trust me.
-What is it?

1005
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:44,761
Come on, follow me.
We don't have any time to lose.

1006
01:02:46,675 --> 01:02:47,851
What are you doing?

1007
01:02:49,026 --> 01:02:50,375
I...

1008
01:02:51,593 --> 01:02:53,334
am calling

1009
01:02:53,508 --> 01:02:54,945
my parents.

1010
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:58,252
What for?
I don't want you
to involve them.

1011
01:02:58,426 --> 01:03:00,602
We're going to need their help
if this is going to work.

1012
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:01,995
If what's going to work?

1013
01:03:02,169 --> 01:03:04,476
It's ringing.

1014
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:06,739
Hey, Mom, it's me. You and
Dad get to Grandma's ranch
as soon as possible.

1015
01:03:06,913 --> 01:03:07,958
I'll explain it
when you get here.

1016
01:03:08,132 --> 01:03:09,655
Alright, bye.

1017
01:03:09,829 --> 01:03:12,136
Okay, let's go downstairs.
Bring your phone.

1018
01:03:18,185 --> 01:03:21,014
Lizzy, just stop,
you've got to

1019
01:03:21,188 --> 01:03:23,669
tell me what is going on
in that brain of yours.

1020
01:03:23,843 --> 01:03:26,933
Call every person
that you know, and call in
every favor that you can.

1021
01:03:27,107 --> 01:03:29,936
-What for?
-We're going to turn the ranch
into a Christmas market.

1022
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:32,286
-A Christmas market?
-Yes.

1023
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:34,854
Call all the farms that
you've saved and have
them bring

1024
01:03:35,028 --> 01:03:37,291
vegetables, fruits, food,

1025
01:03:37,465 --> 01:03:39,728
drinks, crafts,
anything and everything.

1026
01:03:39,903 --> 01:03:41,600
What if they can't?

1027
01:03:41,774 --> 01:03:43,689
You saved them, Grandma,
and now you need their help.

1028
01:03:43,863 --> 01:03:45,038
They owe you.

1029
01:03:45,212 --> 01:03:46,387
A Christmas market?

1030
01:03:46,561 --> 01:03:48,781
Yes.

1031
01:03:48,955 --> 01:03:51,262
We'll have all the tables
all set up in the barn
with the merchandise.

1032
01:03:51,436 --> 01:03:53,568
We'll have Christmas music
playing, and Hope will be
one of the attractions.

1033
01:03:53,742 --> 01:03:55,919
I don't think something
like that'll work.

1034
01:03:56,093 --> 01:03:57,921
Trust me, Grandma, it will.

1035
01:03:58,095 --> 01:03:59,400
You really believe it.

1036
01:03:59,574 --> 01:04:01,489
I do.

1037
01:04:01,663 --> 01:04:02,795
Now get calling.
We need as much
help as we can get.

1038
01:04:04,797 --> 01:04:07,321
-Everybody?
-Yes.

1039
01:04:07,495 --> 01:04:09,019
Okay, I don't need you
over my shoulder.

1040
01:04:09,193 --> 01:04:10,803
-Go.
-Okay.

1041
01:04:24,643 --> 01:04:26,863
-[Susan] Lizzy.
-[David] Are you alright?

1042
01:04:27,037 --> 01:04:28,821
You guys came.

1043
01:04:28,995 --> 01:04:31,171
We kept trying to call you
back, but you didn't pick up,

1044
01:04:31,345 --> 01:04:32,303
and your grandmother's not
answering. What's going on?
Are you okay?

1045
01:04:32,477 --> 01:04:34,653
I'm sorry, my phone was off.

1046
01:04:34,827 --> 01:04:36,437
And out of the blue,
you tell us to get here
as quickly as you can?

1047
01:04:36,611 --> 01:04:38,396
You've got us
really worried, Lizzy!

1048
01:04:38,570 --> 01:04:40,659
I'm gonna save
Grandma's ranch.

1049
01:04:40,833 --> 01:04:42,487
Save it?

1050
01:04:42,661 --> 01:04:45,490
Did you guys know Grandma
was in a lot of debt?

1051
01:04:47,448 --> 01:04:50,190
Yeah, well,
you shouldn't know that.

1052
01:04:50,364 --> 01:04:55,326
Well, we need to raise $,3500,
or else the bank is going
to take the ranch from her.

1053
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:57,197
Lizzy, where
is your grandmother?

1054
01:04:57,371 --> 01:04:59,243
She's in the house, probably
making phone calls.

1055
01:04:59,417 --> 01:05:01,680
Alright, I've got
to go talk to her.

1056
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:06,685
-I just need you guys
to help me out here.
-What do you need?

1057
01:05:06,859 --> 01:05:08,687
I have some more
of these tables
in the back of the house.

1058
01:05:08,861 --> 01:05:10,341
So we just need to bring
them out here to the barn

1059
01:05:10,515 --> 01:05:11,820
and set them up,
but we need
to move fast.

1060
01:05:11,995 --> 01:05:13,997
Okay, come on, let's go.

1061
01:05:18,349 --> 01:05:19,828
Okay, Charlie, that's great.

1062
01:05:20,003 --> 01:05:21,918
Thank you.

1063
01:05:22,092 --> 01:05:23,571
Alright, I'll see you
tomorrow then,
bright and early.

1064
01:05:24,137 --> 01:05:25,356
Okay.

1065
01:05:25,704 --> 01:05:26,748
Merry Christmas.

1066
01:05:27,488 --> 01:05:29,534
What's going on, Mom?

1067
01:05:29,708 --> 01:05:31,405
Are you really
in that much trouble?

1068
01:05:32,319 --> 01:05:34,495
Apparently, I am.

1069
01:05:34,669 --> 01:05:38,456
A lady from the bank
came by and has given me
until Christmas Eve

1070
01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:41,459
to come up
with a very inflated
loan payment.

1071
01:05:42,764 --> 01:05:44,288
You should have asked me
if you needed help.

1072
01:05:44,462 --> 01:05:46,333
I don't want you
to lose this place.

1073
01:05:46,507 --> 01:05:48,379
David, you and Susan
have enough problems
of your own.

1074
01:05:48,553 --> 01:05:50,729
I wasn't going to burden
you with this too.

1075
01:05:50,903 --> 01:05:53,514
Besides, all things
happen for a reason.

1076
01:05:53,688 --> 01:05:56,343
There's gotta be
something we can do.

1077
01:05:56,517 --> 01:05:58,041
Lizzy's doing something.

1078
01:05:59,433 --> 01:06:01,174
What'd she do now?

1079
01:06:01,348 --> 01:06:03,437
Apparently,
she's saving the ranch.

1080
01:06:03,611 --> 01:06:05,135
Mom, she's a 16-year-old girl.

1081
01:06:05,309 --> 01:06:06,788
How is she going to
be able to do that?

1082
01:06:07,876 --> 01:06:09,095
She's smart,

1083
01:06:09,269 --> 01:06:11,228
and she's very creative.

1084
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:13,708
And so determined.

1085
01:06:14,448 --> 01:06:16,233
I'm listening to her.

1086
01:06:16,407 --> 01:06:18,583
Now go,
I've got things to do.

1087
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:22,935
Well, alright.
But what do you need me to do?

1088
01:06:23,109 --> 01:06:26,025
Go see Lizzy.
I'm sure she's got
a list for you too.

1089
01:06:26,199 --> 01:06:27,331
She's in charge?

1090
01:06:27,505 --> 01:06:29,942
Yes. She's in charge.

1091
01:06:30,116 --> 01:06:32,423
She wants to be
trusted with this.

1092
01:06:33,163 --> 01:06:34,338
Do you?

1093
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:36,427
Do you trust her?

1094
01:06:39,343 --> 01:06:41,432
She really cares
about this place.

1095
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:44,609
Give her a chance to show it.

1096
01:06:52,182 --> 01:06:54,445
Rhoda. Hi, it's Mary.

1097
01:06:55,272 --> 01:06:56,577
Listen, something
has come up,

1098
01:06:56,751 --> 01:06:59,798
and well, I've got a big
favor to ask you.

1099
01:07:04,672 --> 01:07:07,240
I'd really like it if you
and Dad would stay
for market tomorrow.

1100
01:07:07,414 --> 01:07:09,329
Lizzy, we have to work.

1101
01:07:11,201 --> 01:07:12,376
Figures.

1102
01:07:14,508 --> 01:07:18,295
I'll call in to the office,
and we have to ask your
grandma if it's okay.

1103
01:07:18,469 --> 01:07:19,818
She won't mind.

1104
01:07:21,559 --> 01:07:23,561
You really think
this is going to work?

1105
01:07:24,605 --> 01:07:25,650
Yeah.

1106
01:07:27,347 --> 01:07:29,523
It's going to be
a beautiful market, Mom.

1107
01:07:30,133 --> 01:07:31,221
What are we selling?

1108
01:07:31,395 --> 01:07:32,874
Whatever people bring us.

1109
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:35,138
Things should be coming
in any minute now.

1110
01:07:35,312 --> 01:07:38,532
Well, what else do we have
to do to set up for tomorrow?

1111
01:07:38,706 --> 01:07:41,753
I can't think of anything
right now, so I think
we're good.

1112
01:07:41,927 --> 01:07:44,190
But I'll let you know
if anything come up.

1113
01:07:44,364 --> 01:07:45,322
Okay.

1114
01:07:45,496 --> 01:07:46,845
Sounds great.

1115
01:07:53,982 --> 01:07:55,636
[Mary]
Oh, my goodness.

1116
01:07:56,333 --> 01:07:57,725
It's beautiful.

1117
01:08:01,251 --> 01:08:03,035
It's amazing.

1118
01:08:03,209 --> 01:08:04,645
-[Mary] Angie.
-Hi, Mary.

1119
01:08:04,819 --> 01:08:07,692
Oh, this looks gorgeous.
Thank you.

1120
01:08:07,866 --> 01:08:10,086
-You're welcome.
Hi, Lizzy.
-Hey.

1121
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:12,392
-Beautiful.
-Thank you.

1122
01:08:13,872 --> 01:08:15,961
All of this is
from the McDougalls.

1123
01:08:16,135 --> 01:08:19,182
Part of that money from
the loan, it saved their ranch.

1124
01:08:19,356 --> 01:08:21,880
And it's all a gift.

1125
01:08:22,054 --> 01:08:23,708
-That's amazing.
-I know.

1126
01:08:23,882 --> 01:08:27,712
-Well, where do we put them?
-Oh, ask the boss.

1127
01:08:27,886 --> 01:08:30,323
Hey Mom, Dad, can you
come help us put some
of these over there?

1128
01:08:30,497 --> 01:08:32,325
We're going to be selling
them tomorrow morning.

1129
01:08:32,499 --> 01:08:34,066
Are they going to be
okay overnight?

1130
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:36,024
They should be fine.

1131
01:08:36,199 --> 01:08:38,592
The barn gets really cold
at night, so they'll be good.

1132
01:08:38,766 --> 01:08:40,507
[David]
How do you know that?

1133
01:08:41,595 --> 01:08:43,423
I may have stayed there
overnight.

1134
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:46,209
You let Lizzy sleep
in the barn?

1135
01:08:46,383 --> 01:08:48,602
[Mary]
I may have.

1136
01:08:48,776 --> 01:08:51,257
[David]
How come you wouldn't
when I was a kid?

1137
01:08:51,431 --> 01:08:52,911
[Mary]
She's pretty special.

1138
01:09:00,658 --> 01:09:01,702
Hey.

1139
01:09:01,876 --> 01:09:02,921
Hey.

1140
01:09:06,490 --> 01:09:07,926
Thanks for coming back.

1141
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:10,015
Yeah, Mary asked me to.

1142
01:09:10,189 --> 01:09:11,930
-She did?
-Yeah.

1143
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:15,760
I'm sorry for yelling at you.

1144
01:09:17,109 --> 01:09:19,155
You have an anger problem.

1145
01:09:19,894 --> 01:09:21,113
I might.

1146
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:29,861
So, are you guys setting
up for market day here?

1147
01:09:30,035 --> 01:09:31,732
Yeah, did Mary tell you?

1148
01:09:31,906 --> 01:09:34,082
Yeah, she asked me to bring
some things to sell too.

1149
01:09:34,257 --> 01:09:35,780
Oh, can I see?

1150
01:09:38,261 --> 01:09:43,048
Only if you promise
not to start screaming,
crying, or hitting me, okay?

1151
01:09:43,222 --> 01:09:44,180
Okay.

1152
01:09:46,921 --> 01:09:48,009
Sorry, I had to.

1153
01:09:50,403 --> 01:09:51,578
Wow.

1154
01:09:52,579 --> 01:09:54,102
You think these are
good enough to sell?

1155
01:09:54,277 --> 01:09:56,148
They're perfect. Thank you.

1156
01:09:56,322 --> 01:09:57,845
Are you sure you
want to sell them?

1157
01:09:58,019 --> 01:10:00,500
I want to save this ranch
just as much as you do.

1158
01:10:02,807 --> 01:10:06,463
Oh, do you know anybody
who has a Santa costume?

1159
01:10:06,637 --> 01:10:08,378
-Yeah, I think I just might.
-Awesome.

1160
01:10:08,552 --> 01:10:10,031
I'll need it tomorrow morning.

1161
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:11,772
Can do.

1162
01:10:11,946 --> 01:10:13,644
Alright, let's start
setting these up.

1163
01:10:24,916 --> 01:10:27,745
And Hope here is going
to be the center attraction.

1164
01:10:27,919 --> 01:10:31,009
Do we have enough?
Are we going to be able
to make enough money?

1165
01:10:31,531 --> 01:10:33,707
Yeah, I think so.

1166
01:10:33,881 --> 01:10:36,493
I called in all the favors
I could. All we can do now
is just wait.

1167
01:10:36,667 --> 01:10:38,756
I think it looks
beautiful, honey.

1168
01:10:38,930 --> 01:10:40,323
Thanks, Mom.

1169
01:10:40,497 --> 01:10:42,542
You guys can have my bed
tonight if you want.

1170
01:10:42,716 --> 01:10:44,152
Where are you going to sleep?

1171
01:10:44,327 --> 01:10:45,850
I'm going to take the sofa.

1172
01:10:46,024 --> 01:10:47,721
Besides, I've got a lot
of stuff to think about.

1173
01:10:47,895 --> 01:10:50,550
So I probably won't be
getting much sleep anyway.

1174
01:10:50,724 --> 01:10:52,509
[David]
You know what?

1175
01:10:52,683 --> 01:10:54,250
We're really proud of you.

1176
01:10:55,729 --> 01:10:58,036
But let's see how
tomorrow goes first.

1177
01:11:16,359 --> 01:11:18,230
Happy market day.

1178
01:11:19,362 --> 01:11:20,232
Lizzy?

1179
01:11:21,451 --> 01:11:22,800
What time is it?

1180
01:11:22,974 --> 01:11:23,714
What is this?

1181
01:11:23,888 --> 01:11:25,368
Is this a joke?

1182
01:11:25,542 --> 01:11:27,152
Lizzy, who is this?

1183
01:11:27,326 --> 01:11:29,197
Oh, I'm James.

1184
01:11:29,372 --> 01:11:31,025
We haven't officially met yet.

1185
01:11:31,199 --> 01:11:32,375
Nice to meet you both.

1186
01:11:32,549 --> 01:11:33,854
Nice to meet you.

1187
01:11:34,028 --> 01:11:35,247
Pleasure.

1188
01:11:35,421 --> 01:11:36,988
This is perfect.

1189
01:11:37,162 --> 01:11:38,119
What's that for?

1190
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:39,686
It's for you to wear, Dad.

1191
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:42,428
-You're kidding right?
-No, I'm not.

1192
01:11:42,602 --> 01:11:46,389
We're going to be taking
pictures at market of kids and
families with Santa and Hope.

1193
01:11:46,563 --> 01:11:48,304
It'll be Santa and his pony.

1194
01:11:48,478 --> 01:11:49,609
I came up with the idea
yesterday.

1195
01:11:49,783 --> 01:11:52,220
I love it.
It's a great idea.

1196
01:11:52,395 --> 01:11:54,048
But Santa doesn't have a pony?

1197
01:11:54,222 --> 01:11:55,746
Well, ours will.

1198
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:58,270
But I'm not fat enough
to be Santa.

1199
01:11:59,750 --> 01:12:01,926
-Am I?
-Close enough.

1200
01:12:03,188 --> 01:12:05,538
Ho ho ho.

1201
01:12:05,712 --> 01:12:08,236
Oh, mom, I'm going to need you
to be in charge of all the
money stuff, okay?

1202
01:12:08,411 --> 01:12:10,413
I'm going to go downstairs
and start helping out grandma
with setting up everything.

1203
01:12:10,587 --> 01:12:13,111
So you guys hurry up
and get dressed. Go.

1204
01:12:19,465 --> 01:12:20,771
[sighs]

1205
01:12:32,522 --> 01:12:34,654
This is it.

1206
01:12:34,828 --> 01:12:36,613
Those people really
didn't let you down.

1207
01:12:36,787 --> 01:12:38,179
They brought
a lot of good stuff.

1208
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:40,138
I'm surrounded by
really good people.

1209
01:12:40,312 --> 01:12:42,793
I feel really blessed.

1210
01:12:46,797 --> 01:12:48,973
Now I just have to
see whose going to show up.

1211
01:12:49,887 --> 01:12:51,454
Oh, they'll come.

1212
01:12:51,628 --> 01:12:53,978
-Are you sure?
-Absolutely.

1213
01:12:59,984 --> 01:13:00,985
Thank you.

1214
01:13:01,289 --> 01:13:03,074
For what?

1215
01:13:03,248 --> 01:13:05,293
For what?
For being the best
granddaughter ever.

1216
01:13:05,468 --> 01:13:07,383
[laughing]

1217
01:13:07,557 --> 01:13:08,993
That's all.

1218
01:13:11,996 --> 01:13:13,998
It's been a
special couple of weeks.

1219
01:13:17,131 --> 01:13:19,177
-What is that?
-People are coming!

1220
01:13:21,353 --> 01:13:23,137
-It's gonna work.
-Oh, this is great!

1221
01:13:23,311 --> 01:13:25,618
[laughing]

1222
01:13:25,792 --> 01:13:28,665
-Come on.
-Go on up there.
Go on up there.

1223
01:13:28,839 --> 01:13:30,493
Oh, come on!
Oh, this is so exciting!

1224
01:13:30,667 --> 01:13:31,668
-Let's get up there.
-Yeah!

1225
01:13:31,842 --> 01:13:33,278
Before they get here.

1226
01:14:07,268 --> 01:14:08,444
[laughing]

1227
01:14:13,623 --> 01:14:15,233
How much you got?

1228
01:14:31,641 --> 01:14:33,381
I didn't say I'd
give you a horse.

1229
01:14:33,556 --> 01:14:35,471
No, I'm just kidding
you can have it.

1230
01:14:37,516 --> 01:14:39,387
Hey, how's it going?

1231
01:14:39,562 --> 01:14:42,608
-People like them.
-Good, I told you they would.

1232
01:14:54,054 --> 01:14:55,360
Next. Come on in.

1233
01:14:55,534 --> 01:14:57,493
Ho ho ho, Merry Christmas!

1234
01:15:01,409 --> 01:15:02,976
Ho ho ho.

1235
01:15:04,064 --> 01:15:06,893
Feels good to take pictures.
It's been a while.

1236
01:15:07,067 --> 01:15:08,678
Good, I'm glad.

1237
01:15:10,418 --> 01:15:12,508
Good job, Hope.
Good boy.

1238
01:15:15,946 --> 01:15:17,034
Good job, boy.

1239
01:15:18,252 --> 01:15:20,777
-[David] Ahem.
-You too, Dad.

1240
01:15:20,951 --> 01:15:21,952
Thanks, Lizzy.

1241

[inaudible]

1242
01:15:53,374 --> 01:15:54,637
We did good.

1243
01:15:59,119 --> 01:16:00,686
How good?

1244
01:16:00,860 --> 01:16:04,516
Enough to cover at least
a few months of payments.

1245
01:16:06,083 --> 01:16:08,302
Is that enough time to finish
Hope's training for shows?

1246
01:16:08,476 --> 01:16:10,304
Absolutely. Yes!

1247
01:16:10,478 --> 01:16:13,830
[laughing] You did it.
You did it!

1248
01:16:14,004 --> 01:16:16,049
No, no, we all did it.

1249
01:16:16,223 --> 01:16:18,356
None of this could have
happened if everybody
hadn't helped.

1250
01:16:18,530 --> 01:16:21,011
This guy's art made
most of the money.

1251
01:16:21,402 --> 01:16:22,752
Thank you.

1252
01:16:22,926 --> 01:16:25,102
-Thank you, James.
-You're welcome.

1253
01:16:26,538 --> 01:16:28,453
I'm so happy for you, Mom.

1254
01:16:28,627 --> 01:16:30,194
This place belongs to you.

1255
01:16:30,368 --> 01:16:31,587
Thank you.

1256
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:35,721
Thank you all so much!

1257
01:16:38,419 --> 01:16:42,032
Mom, Dad, can I stay
with Grandma?

1258
01:16:46,819 --> 01:16:48,299
-Yeah, why not?
-Sure.

1259
01:16:48,473 --> 01:16:50,606
[all laughing]

1260
01:16:55,872 --> 01:16:57,525
She'll be fine.
You drive careful.

1261
01:16:57,700 --> 01:16:59,919
-Absolutely.
-Now go.

1262
01:17:00,093 --> 01:17:01,225
Bye, Mom.

1263
01:17:06,056 --> 01:17:08,406
You know, we're really
glad you called.

1264
01:17:08,580 --> 01:17:10,060
We're very proud
of you, honey.

1265
01:17:10,669 --> 01:17:12,584
Thanks, Mom.

1266
01:17:12,758 --> 01:17:15,369
We'll drop this off
at the bank first thing, Mom.

1267
01:17:15,543 --> 01:17:17,458
-Thanks for doing that, Dad.
-Sure.

1268
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:18,677
I love you.

1269
01:17:18,851 --> 01:17:20,810
You did an amazing job, honey.

1270
01:17:20,984 --> 01:17:24,640
Thanks. Now, you guys
let us know as soon as
you drop that off, okay?

1271
01:17:24,814 --> 01:17:27,381
Grandma's still in denial
she gets to keep this place.

1272
01:17:27,555 --> 01:17:29,906
Hey, it's all because of you.

1273
01:17:36,869 --> 01:17:37,827
Bye.

1274
01:17:38,523 --> 01:17:39,742
Well...

1275
01:17:42,353 --> 01:17:43,223
you did it.

1276
01:17:43,397 --> 01:17:45,182
No, Grandma, Hope did it.

1277
01:17:45,356 --> 01:17:47,663
None of this would have
happened if it wasn't for Hope.

1278
01:17:49,055 --> 01:17:50,013
Hope, huh?

1279
01:17:51,101 --> 01:17:53,451
-You've taught me something.
-What?

1280
01:17:53,625 --> 01:17:55,801
Hope. It's believing.

1281
01:17:57,063 --> 01:17:58,282
I guess it is.

1282
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:02,155
Well, come on.

1283
01:18:02,329 --> 01:18:04,592

Tomorrow, I think I'm
going to raise the bar...
