1
00:01:14,812 --> 00:01:17,148
M-mom?

2
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,383
Are you awake?

3
00:01:18,385 --> 00:01:19,451
Mom?

4
00:01:21,423 --> 00:01:23,659
Zoso, what are you doing up?

5
00:01:23,661 --> 00:01:25,361
It's still early.

6
00:01:25,363 --> 00:01:26,630
Go back to sleep.

7
00:01:26,632 --> 00:01:29,368
I Can't. Olive is scared.

8
00:01:35,814 --> 00:01:37,650
Mom?

9
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,313
Down here.

10
00:02:01,261 --> 00:02:03,229
Zoso, what are you doing
under here?

11
00:02:03,231 --> 00:02:04,464
Mom, I told you...

12
00:02:04,466 --> 00:02:07,504
I don't like
that stupid baby name anymore.

13
00:02:07,506 --> 00:02:09,273
My name's Zoe.

14
00:02:10,877 --> 00:02:13,280
And I'm under here
because I'm hiding.

15
00:02:13,282 --> 00:02:15,484
Olive said we had to hide.

16
00:02:15,486 --> 00:02:17,689
She dreamed they found us.

17
00:02:17,691 --> 00:02:18,891
Who did?

18
00:02:20,394 --> 00:02:21,796
The breathers.

19
00:02:21,798 --> 00:02:24,735
Hey. What did
we just talk about?

20
00:02:24,737 --> 00:02:27,707
Our new rule, remember?
Rule number four.

21
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:29,677
We're not allowed
to talk about them anymore.

22
00:02:29,679 --> 00:02:31,781
I didn't. Olive did.

23
00:02:31,783 --> 00:02:33,918
Well, you can tell olive
that no one found us.

24
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,489
Dad's been keeping watch
all night, just like always.

25
00:02:36,491 --> 00:02:37,491
We're safe here.

26
00:02:37,493 --> 00:02:38,660
You hear that, olive?

27
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:44,638
<i>My smile is stuck.</i>

28
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,407
Her smile's stuck.

29
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:49,079
That means she doesn't
want to be smiling anymore.

30
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:50,615
That means she's still scared.

31
00:02:50,617 --> 00:02:52,484
Would it make olive feel better

32
00:02:52,486 --> 00:02:54,849
if we went
and checked with dad?

33
00:02:59,567 --> 00:03:01,067
It's okay.

34
00:03:10,586 --> 00:03:13,524
All right.

35
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,659
Come on.

36
00:03:22,608 --> 00:03:24,509
It's okay.

37
00:03:27,382 --> 00:03:28,382
Mom, look.

38
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,718
That's just dad.

39
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,001
It doesn't look like dad.

40
00:03:33,426 --> 00:03:35,094
Uh-oh, someone had
another nightmare, huh?

41
00:03:35,096 --> 00:03:37,498
Oh, d-dad.

42
00:03:37,501 --> 00:03:38,934
Hey, hey.

43
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:42,139
I thought we told those
silly nightmares to go away.

44
00:03:42,141 --> 00:03:43,474
We did.

45
00:03:43,476 --> 00:03:45,144
Well, then
why are you so scared?

46
00:03:45,146 --> 00:03:47,716
Better ask olive about that.

47
00:03:47,718 --> 00:03:50,120
Oh, was it olive
this time, huh?

48
00:03:50,122 --> 00:03:52,457
How does she even sleep
with her eyes open all the time?

49
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:54,027
Dad, don't be mean.

50
00:03:54,029 --> 00:03:55,563
I'm just wondering.

51
00:03:55,565 --> 00:03:56,998
She wants a report.

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,035
Well, then I better
consult my notes.

53
00:04:10,591 --> 00:04:12,927
Hmm.

54
00:04:12,929 --> 00:04:14,697
My glasses, please.

55
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:17,569
Thank you.

56
00:04:17,571 --> 00:04:18,837
So...

57
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:23,078
My watch started at 10:00.

58
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,718
At, uh, 2:00, I played
seven games of solitaire.

59
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,855
Won four, lost three.

60
00:04:28,857 --> 00:04:30,959
Lost four, won three.

61
00:04:30,961 --> 00:04:33,831
Miss Zoe,
you see right through me.

62
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:36,703
At 5:00, a couple of deer
ran overhead.

63
00:04:36,705 --> 00:04:38,640
And at 6:00 in the morning,

64
00:04:38,642 --> 00:04:41,779
I heard little footsteps.

65
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:45,953
Possibly belonging
to my rascal of a daughter!

66
00:04:45,955 --> 00:04:47,021
Hmm?

67
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:50,828
But other than that, nothing.

68
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,667
Not a creature was stirring,
not even a...

69
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:54,669
A breather?

70
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:56,271
Zoso.

71
00:04:59,177 --> 00:05:01,046
No.

72
00:05:01,048 --> 00:05:04,118
Not even a... you know.

73
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,023
And the locks?

74
00:05:09,328 --> 00:05:11,999
They still hold fast?

75
00:05:12,001 --> 00:05:13,301
Do you wanna check?

76
00:05:13,303 --> 00:05:14,971
Can I? No.

77
00:05:14,973 --> 00:05:17,208
Ray, I told you I don't want her
going up there anymore.

78
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,212
What? This little monkey?

79
00:05:19,214 --> 00:05:20,682
She can handle it.

80
00:05:20,684 --> 00:05:22,284
Yeah, I can handle it, mom.

81
00:05:22,286 --> 00:05:23,319
I know the rules.

82
00:05:23,321 --> 00:05:24,655
One, never be loud.

83
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:25,790
I know you know the rules.

84
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:26,792
Two, never lose control.

85
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:27,995
Three, never open the door.

86
00:05:27,996 --> 00:05:29,998
Four, never talk
about the breathers.

87
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,381
Careful, Zoso, your shoe.

88
00:05:39,383 --> 00:05:41,652
Got it, mom.

89
00:06:27,976 --> 00:06:29,410
Hold fast?

90
00:06:30,847 --> 00:06:32,983
Hold fast.

91
00:06:46,777 --> 00:06:48,946
Can't I just go barefoot?

92
00:06:48,948 --> 00:06:51,183
No, that wouldn't be right.

93
00:06:51,185 --> 00:06:53,287
Why not?

94
00:06:54,423 --> 00:06:57,161
Because We're not animals, Zoe.

95
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:00,901
I need you to remember that.

96
00:07:00,903 --> 00:07:03,438
But it's not like
I'm going outside or anything.

97
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,343
Well, who needs to go outside
when we brought the sun with us?

98
00:07:13,526 --> 00:07:15,961
Another beautiful day, huh?

99
00:07:15,963 --> 00:07:18,365
Mm-hmm.

100
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,505
Do you wanna make it official?

101
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,489
Not too hard, okay? I don't want
you to slip and cut your hand.

102
00:07:31,491 --> 00:07:32,558
I got it, mom.

103
00:07:33,961 --> 00:07:35,262
Okay.

104
00:07:35,264 --> 00:07:37,533
How many days is that now?

105
00:07:37,535 --> 00:07:39,369
Well, if you don't remember,
just count them.

106
00:07:39,371 --> 00:07:41,106
They're lined up in rows of 25,

107
00:07:41,108 --> 00:07:42,542
and there are how many rows?

108
00:07:42,544 --> 00:07:45,346
One, two, three, eight, nine...

109
00:07:45,348 --> 00:07:46,348
12.

110
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,951
So 25 times 12 makes?

111
00:07:47,953 --> 00:07:51,625
300 plus the one
just I marked, so 301.

112
00:07:51,627 --> 00:07:53,294
That's it.

113
00:07:53,296 --> 00:07:55,859
See? Those math lessons
are really paying off.

114
00:07:58,137 --> 00:08:01,308
<i>Give me a kiss.</i>

115
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,644
That means she's hungry.

116
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:07,520
Let's see here.

117
00:08:07,522 --> 00:08:09,524
We've got hominy...

118
00:08:09,526 --> 00:08:10,659
Corn...

119
00:08:10,661 --> 00:08:12,294
Potatoes...

120
00:08:12,296 --> 00:08:15,366
Beans...

121
00:08:15,368 --> 00:08:16,502
And peaches...

122
00:08:16,504 --> 00:08:18,104
Peaches. Definitely peaches.

123
00:08:18,106 --> 00:08:19,974
You know,
we had peaches yesterday.

124
00:08:19,976 --> 00:08:21,443
We can have them again
tomorrow.

125
00:08:21,445 --> 00:08:23,180
But I was thinking today,

126
00:08:23,182 --> 00:08:25,518
maybe we should try something
with a little protein.

127
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,254
Maybe beans, for once.

128
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,124
Ew, beans are the worst.

129
00:08:29,126 --> 00:08:30,359
Dad? Yeah?

130
00:08:30,361 --> 00:08:31,595
Beans or peaches?

131
00:08:31,597 --> 00:08:34,466
Uh, I don't know.

132
00:08:34,468 --> 00:08:35,535
Peaches.

133
00:08:35,537 --> 00:08:37,437
Peaches sound
pretty good to me.

134
00:08:37,439 --> 00:08:38,506
Ray.

135
00:08:40,611 --> 00:08:43,983
Uh, how about we take a vote?
Ray.

136
00:08:43,985 --> 00:08:47,089
All those in favor of beans,
please raise your hand.

137
00:08:48,058 --> 00:08:49,292
One vote for beans.

138
00:08:49,294 --> 00:08:50,528
Now, all those in favor

139
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,330
of deliciously sweet
and juicy peaches,

140
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:53,533
please raise your hand.

141
00:08:55,538 --> 00:08:57,541
Sorry, hon.

142
00:08:57,543 --> 00:08:59,611
Two against one.

143
00:08:59,613 --> 00:09:01,013
Three.

144
00:09:26,731 --> 00:09:29,367
Is Darlene acting up again?

145
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:31,605
Oh, she's a tough gal.

146
00:09:31,607 --> 00:09:34,610
She just needs a little
encouragement, that's all.

147
00:09:37,784 --> 00:09:38,850
Hm.

148
00:09:50,305 --> 00:09:51,939
There we go.
Told you she was tough.

149
00:09:53,711 --> 00:09:55,546
Mom, dad! The peaches are gone!

150
00:09:55,548 --> 00:09:56,749
Not funny, Zoso.

151
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,672
I'm serious!
Someone stole them!

152
00:10:28,676 --> 00:10:31,714
God, that's 12. That's 12 cans.

153
00:10:31,716 --> 00:10:34,018
That's almost
two weeks of rations.

154
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,389
There are no more peaches?

155
00:10:36,391 --> 00:10:39,428
Uh, no. No more peaches.

156
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,898
Something must've been
drawn to the sugar.

157
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,501
Something with teeth.

158
00:10:42,503 --> 00:10:44,838
What has teeth like that?

159
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,273
A rat, probably.

160
00:10:46,275 --> 00:10:48,343
But a rat couldn't get in here.

161
00:10:48,345 --> 00:10:50,548
I checked the door,
it's hold fast.

162
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,952
The door is not
the only way in.

163
00:11:00,533 --> 00:11:03,504
Can the breathers
get in there too?

164
00:11:03,506 --> 00:11:04,506
Zoso.

165
00:11:04,508 --> 00:11:05,774
Can they?

166
00:11:05,776 --> 00:11:09,013
No, they're too big
to fit in there.

167
00:11:09,015 --> 00:11:11,083
But a rat could.

168
00:11:13,054 --> 00:11:15,792
If it's a rat,
it's still in here somewhere.

169
00:11:17,696 --> 00:11:19,932
We have to keep an eye out.

170
00:11:19,934 --> 00:11:23,471
We have to find it
before it steals any more food.

171
00:11:23,473 --> 00:11:26,945
In the meantime, we'll have to
cut down on our rations.

172
00:11:26,947 --> 00:11:29,951
Dad, they're already so small.

173
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:36,061
I'm sorry, Zoe.

174
00:11:37,632 --> 00:11:40,002
I really am.

175
00:11:54,096 --> 00:11:56,466
I'm not gonna
ask you again. Eat.

176
00:11:56,468 --> 00:11:58,002
Mom, I told you
I don't want stupid beans.

177
00:11:58,004 --> 00:12:00,006
Hey, Zoso,
remember rule number two.

178
00:12:00,008 --> 00:12:01,843
Never lose control.

179
00:12:01,845 --> 00:12:03,680
Never let anger take over.

180
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:05,149
Rule number five,
never call me Zoso.

181
00:12:05,151 --> 00:12:06,919
I just wanted some peaches.

182
00:12:06,921 --> 00:12:08,589
Well, a thief stole them,

183
00:12:08,591 --> 00:12:10,826
and now We're all gonna
have to give some things up.

184
00:12:10,828 --> 00:12:12,529
I already have nothing.

185
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:15,100
I'm stuck in here.
I Can't even go outside.

186
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:18,005
I don't have any friends...

187
00:12:18,007 --> 00:12:20,209
Except olive, and she can
only say five things.

188
00:12:20,211 --> 00:12:22,213
What about us? What?

189
00:12:22,215 --> 00:12:25,687
Well, you said
you don't have any friends.

190
00:12:25,689 --> 00:12:26,889
What about us?

191
00:12:26,891 --> 00:12:28,525
Mom and I aren't your friends?

192
00:12:28,527 --> 00:12:30,562
You know what I mean.
No, actually, I don't.

193
00:12:30,564 --> 00:12:32,599
I think it's real silly
to say you don't have anything

194
00:12:32,601 --> 00:12:34,636
when you really have
<i>everything.</i>

195
00:12:34,638 --> 00:12:36,071
Yeah, right. Yeah, right.

196
00:12:36,073 --> 00:12:37,841
Look at that.

197
00:12:37,843 --> 00:12:40,713
How many days
did you say that was?

198
00:12:40,715 --> 00:12:42,850
301.

199
00:12:42,852 --> 00:12:45,856
301.

200
00:12:45,858 --> 00:12:46,958
Now, we shouldn't
have been around

201
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,695
for any one of those days,

202
00:12:48,697 --> 00:12:51,600
but just when we needed it,

203
00:12:51,602 --> 00:12:53,604
we found this shelter.

204
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:57,177
And it's given us
food, a home, a life.

205
00:12:57,179 --> 00:13:00,149
And for all we know,
we could be the only ones left,

206
00:13:00,151 --> 00:13:03,021
the only ones still alive.

207
00:13:03,023 --> 00:13:08,531
So every one of those marks
is really a miracle.

208
00:13:09,534 --> 00:13:10,635
A miracle?

209
00:13:10,637 --> 00:13:12,037
That's right. A miracle.

210
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:14,909
And this food is gonna allow you
to live another day.

211
00:13:14,911 --> 00:13:17,614
And that means another hatch
can be drawn, right?

212
00:13:17,616 --> 00:13:19,551
Yeah, I guess so.

213
00:13:19,553 --> 00:13:25,127
So you see, those nasty, cold,
mushy beans on your plate,

214
00:13:25,129 --> 00:13:28,066
they're really
their own kind of miracle too.

215
00:13:28,068 --> 00:13:32,173
And if you eat
your mushy miracles for us...

216
00:13:33,977 --> 00:13:36,881
Then maybe we can
take a trip afterwards.

217
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:38,049
A trip? Really?

218
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:39,351
Really.

219
00:13:39,353 --> 00:13:41,021
But you better eat fast,

220
00:13:41,023 --> 00:13:44,160
'cause I finished my miracle
beans, and I want more!

221
00:13:48,335 --> 00:13:50,772
Careful with it, dad.

222
00:13:54,913 --> 00:13:56,281
That goes there.
Joey's house goes there.

223
00:13:56,283 --> 00:13:59,086
All right. Off we go.

224
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,856
Eight.

225
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,361
Five, six, seven...

226
00:14:04,363 --> 00:14:05,831
Sylvia's ice cream!

227
00:14:07,902 --> 00:14:09,971
Okay.

228
00:14:09,973 --> 00:14:11,708
Let me get the door.

229
00:14:13,045 --> 00:14:14,746
Door's open.

230
00:14:16,049 --> 00:14:18,085
The chimes ring above you.

231
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:22,994
And look, There's Sylvia
standing behind the counter,

232
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:26,801
and she's wearing
that silly cone-shaped apron.

233
00:14:26,803 --> 00:14:30,274
"Good morning, little Zoe."

234
00:14:32,948 --> 00:14:35,885
And she hands you one of those
little, pink plastic spoons.

235
00:14:38,457 --> 00:14:39,959
Then you run your other hand

236
00:14:39,961 --> 00:14:42,296
along that cold
glass countertop.

237
00:14:45,136 --> 00:14:48,274
Inside, you see
barrels and barrels

238
00:14:48,276 --> 00:14:51,480
of Sylvia's
fresh homemade ice cream.

239
00:14:51,482 --> 00:14:54,720
Now, it's still early, so she's
got all the best flavors.

240
00:14:54,722 --> 00:14:58,326
Salted honey,
peanut butter brittle crunch,

241
00:14:58,328 --> 00:15:02,267
and, of course, your favorite.

242
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:04,471
Strawberry shortcake.

243
00:15:07,011 --> 00:15:08,779
Are you there?

244
00:15:17,129 --> 00:15:19,031
You happy now?

245
00:15:21,136 --> 00:15:22,905
Till tomorrow.

246
00:15:23,874 --> 00:15:25,475
Till tomorrow.

247
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,973
Uh, you win.

248
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,015
I win.

249
00:15:51,157 --> 00:15:53,160
Aha! I win.

250
00:15:53,162 --> 00:15:54,963
Everything's gonna work out.

251
00:15:54,965 --> 00:15:57,300
I'm trying to believe that, ray.
I really am.

252
00:15:57,302 --> 00:16:00,573
But imaginary ice cream
isn't gonna feed our daughter.

253
00:16:00,575 --> 00:16:02,342
I'm just trying
to keep her spirits up.

254
00:16:02,344 --> 00:16:03,878
And you<i> are.</i>

255
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,215
But what happens
when she gets sick?

256
00:16:06,217 --> 00:16:10,590
We've lost a lot of weight
already, all of us.

257
00:16:10,592 --> 00:16:12,359
And now...

258
00:16:12,361 --> 00:16:16,166
And now We're just gonna have to
find a way to get more food.

259
00:16:16,168 --> 00:16:18,871
<i>Real</i> food.

260
00:16:18,873 --> 00:16:20,473
Go to the damn surface
if I have to.

261
00:16:20,475 --> 00:16:22,544
You Can't, ray. They're...
They're still looking for us.

262
00:16:22,546 --> 00:16:24,246
Yeah, well, I can fight them.

263
00:16:24,248 --> 00:16:26,651
That's suicide,
and you know it.

264
00:16:29,891 --> 00:16:33,062
You remember our promise
when we first got here?

265
00:16:33,064 --> 00:16:35,433
Zoe comes first.

266
00:16:35,435 --> 00:16:37,203
No matter the cost.

267
00:16:38,974 --> 00:16:41,210
The important thing is
we still haven't been found.

268
00:16:41,212 --> 00:16:42,278
Except by a rat.

269
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,382
But<i> only</i> by a rat.

270
00:16:50,394 --> 00:16:52,664
Oh, honey.

271
00:17:01,549 --> 00:17:04,687
Try changing
your point of view.

272
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:08,561
This shelter can be a prison,
or it can be a home.

273
00:17:08,563 --> 00:17:10,397
Beans can be beans,
or they can be...

274
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,100
Miracle beans.

275
00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:14,403
Why not?

276
00:17:14,405 --> 00:17:17,308
Because I'm not
nine years old, ray.

277
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,833
I get what You're
trying to do for Zoso.

278
00:17:21,551 --> 00:17:23,953
But I don't believe
in miracles.

279
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,128
Not anymore.

280
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,263
You should.

281
00:17:29,265 --> 00:17:31,768
This is our life now,

282
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:34,740
and we have to live it
the best we can.

283
00:17:37,245 --> 00:17:39,281
Or else what's the point?

284
00:17:39,283 --> 00:17:41,318
The point is to stay alive.

285
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,688
We can do that...

286
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,295
And still live.

287
00:17:50,268 --> 00:17:51,837
Hmm?

288
00:18:01,657 --> 00:18:02,858
Ray?

289
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,193
Huh?

290
00:18:04,195 --> 00:18:06,363
What are you doing?

291
00:18:06,365 --> 00:18:07,733
Living.

292
00:18:11,775 --> 00:18:13,711
We got to be real quiet.

293
00:18:13,713 --> 00:18:14,846
Relax.

294
00:18:44,872 --> 00:18:47,008
I'll see you tonight.

295
00:18:48,912 --> 00:18:50,714
Have fun.

296
00:19:00,501 --> 00:19:03,403
Come on, come on, come on! No,
no, no! Too far to walk there!

297
00:19:03,405 --> 00:19:05,808
Mom! Mom! Please!

298
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:08,345
Zoe!

299
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,883
Mom! Dad! They're coming!

300
00:19:21,504 --> 00:19:23,339
Uh-oh. That's a doozy.

301
00:19:23,341 --> 00:19:24,775
A five and a two.

302
00:19:24,777 --> 00:19:27,412
So, five divided by two is...

303
00:19:27,414 --> 00:19:28,548
Two and a half.

304
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,952
Bingo.
You can move your car now.

305
00:19:30,954 --> 00:19:33,857
Come on. I thought this would be
a fun change of pace.

306
00:19:33,859 --> 00:19:36,461
It's still boring math, mom.
Even with Kingsville.

307
00:19:36,463 --> 00:19:39,433
Well, if it's so boring,
how come olive's still smiling?

308
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:42,071
That's her fake smile.

309
00:19:42,073 --> 00:19:45,578
That's why she looks
a little, you know...

310
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,113
Creepy?

311
00:19:47,115 --> 00:19:48,916
I didn't mean that, honey.

312
00:19:48,918 --> 00:19:52,422
She just... needs a bath.
That's all.

313
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:54,426
How about we have
another go around the board

314
00:19:54,428 --> 00:19:56,998
and then we take a break, okay?

315
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,066
Okay.

316
00:20:06,482 --> 00:20:09,888
Mom, do you think dad's right?

317
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,725
Right about what?

318
00:20:11,727 --> 00:20:15,933
You know, about the three of us
being the only ones left.

319
00:20:21,443 --> 00:20:23,479
The periscope?

320
00:20:23,481 --> 00:20:24,982
That's right.

321
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:27,720
What do you want me
to do with it?

322
00:20:27,722 --> 00:20:28,955
What do you think?

323
00:20:30,425 --> 00:20:32,996
I want you to look up there.

324
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:34,465
On the surface?

325
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:35,901
Mm-hmm.

326
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:37,738
I thought you said
I wasn't allowed to do that,

327
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,075
ever, ever, ever,
or I'd be dead meat.

328
00:20:40,077 --> 00:20:42,780
Yeah, well...

329
00:20:42,782 --> 00:20:44,850
I'm trying something new today.

330
00:20:44,852 --> 00:20:46,085
What?

331
00:20:47,154 --> 00:20:48,890
Relaxing.

332
00:21:42,793 --> 00:21:45,163
So, what do you see?

333
00:21:46,132 --> 00:21:47,667
Nothing.

334
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:50,038
The school. Playground.

335
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,075
Nothing.

336
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:53,343
Dad's right.

337
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:55,581
It's just us left.

338
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:56,849
Us and olive.

339
00:21:56,851 --> 00:21:58,919
But do you see us and olive?
No, mom.

340
00:21:58,921 --> 00:22:01,363
Do you even see
the shelter door?

341
00:22:04,363 --> 00:22:06,232
I Can't see the door.

342
00:22:06,234 --> 00:22:07,234
It's covered.

343
00:22:07,236 --> 00:22:08,336
Exactly.

344
00:22:10,274 --> 00:22:12,243
When we first came down here,

345
00:22:12,245 --> 00:22:15,617
dad and I made sure
to hide the door, remember?

346
00:22:15,619 --> 00:22:18,321
So that no one
could ever find us.

347
00:22:18,323 --> 00:22:19,657
So?

348
00:22:19,659 --> 00:22:22,896
So... sometimes...

349
00:22:22,898 --> 00:22:24,666
Just because
you Can't see something

350
00:22:24,668 --> 00:22:26,990
doesn't mean it's not there.

351
00:22:29,709 --> 00:22:32,212
Sometimes
the truth's hidden from us.

352
00:22:44,838 --> 00:22:48,978
So you think our friends
could really be out there?

353
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,215
They're just hidden like us?

354
00:22:51,217 --> 00:22:53,954
They could. They'd have to be.

355
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:56,158
Because the breathers
would be hunting them too.

356
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,694
Zoso.

357
00:23:02,303 --> 00:23:04,907
Yeah, that's right. Because the
breathers would be hunting them too.

358
00:23:04,909 --> 00:23:06,911
They hate us a lot, don't they?

359
00:23:06,913 --> 00:23:08,814
To keep hunting us like that?

360
00:23:08,816 --> 00:23:10,717
I don't know that it's hate.

361
00:23:10,719 --> 00:23:13,088
It's just...

362
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:14,825
They're different than we are,

363
00:23:14,827 --> 00:23:17,162
and that makes them as scared
of us as we are of them.

364
00:23:17,164 --> 00:23:18,899
Because of what happened
that day?

365
00:23:18,901 --> 00:23:20,802
Yeah, because of
what happened that day.

366
00:23:22,071 --> 00:23:23,740
You said "breathers."

367
00:23:23,742 --> 00:23:25,175
Yeah.

368
00:23:29,184 --> 00:23:31,286
The thief.

369
00:23:32,355 --> 00:23:33,990
He's back.

370
00:23:37,063 --> 00:23:39,266
Don't look.

371
00:23:39,268 --> 00:23:41,336
Hey.

372
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:43,340
What's wrong?

373
00:23:43,342 --> 00:23:45,878
It's the thief.

374
00:23:57,234 --> 00:23:59,270
That son of a bitch.

375
00:24:01,408 --> 00:24:04,413
I'll kill it. Just stay back
in case it makes a run for it.

376
00:24:04,415 --> 00:24:05,849
No, no,<i> you</i> stay back.
<i>I'll</i> kill it.

377
00:24:05,851 --> 00:24:06,884
No,<i> I'll</i> kill it.

378
00:24:06,886 --> 00:24:09,154
We Can't all kill it, guys.

379
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,258
You remember that thanksgiving
at aunt Cathy's

380
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,527
a couple years ago,

381
00:24:12,529 --> 00:24:17,435
with that insane possum
in the backyard?

382
00:24:17,437 --> 00:24:20,340
Who took care of that thing?

383
00:24:37,441 --> 00:24:39,277
After dad kills it,
can we eat it for dinner?

384
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,345
Zoso, quiet.

385
00:24:49,262 --> 00:24:51,131
Get it, dad!

386
00:24:53,638 --> 00:24:54,971
Dad!

387
00:24:58,012 --> 00:24:59,212
Getting away, dad! Hurry!

388
00:24:59,214 --> 00:25:00,347
I know!

389
00:25:02,954 --> 00:25:04,487
Dad!

390
00:25:11,067 --> 00:25:12,635
Mom!

391
00:25:15,708 --> 00:25:17,142
Wow.

392
00:25:20,149 --> 00:25:22,620
That was awesome.

393
00:25:22,622 --> 00:25:25,458
Even more awesome than
when dad killed the possum?

394
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,426
Definitely.

395
00:25:29,267 --> 00:25:30,501
What is that?

396
00:25:37,381 --> 00:25:40,451
Get back. Get back there.

397
00:25:41,454 --> 00:25:42,622
Aah! God damn it!

398
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:43,657
Turn it... turn it off, dad.

399
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:45,326
It's gonna break. Get back.

400
00:25:45,328 --> 00:25:46,595
Get back!

401
00:25:46,597 --> 00:25:48,264
Back!

402
00:25:48,266 --> 00:25:50,034
Back!

403
00:25:53,708 --> 00:25:55,443
It's burning Kingsville!

404
00:25:55,445 --> 00:25:58,148
We'll put it out!
Just stay here!

405
00:25:59,418 --> 00:26:00,518
Stay here!

406
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:07,396
No, not again.

407
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:23,593
Ray! Help me!

408
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,499
Don't break her!

409
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:28,783
Darlene can take it!

410
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,209
Ray, come on!

411
00:26:37,784 --> 00:26:39,820
I told you she's tough!

412
00:26:39,822 --> 00:26:42,184
All right, get back, get back!

413
00:26:47,434 --> 00:26:50,371
Zoso! I told you to stay back!

414
00:27:16,989 --> 00:27:19,459
I Can't see a damn thing.

415
00:27:21,966 --> 00:27:22,999
Hold on.

416
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:31,948
Where's Zoso?

417
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:37,693
Zoe? Zoso?

418
00:27:39,631 --> 00:27:41,600
Zoso?

419
00:27:41,602 --> 00:27:42,635
Zoso.

420
00:27:44,306 --> 00:27:45,607
Hey.

421
00:27:45,609 --> 00:27:47,009
What are you doing?
Did the fire burn you?

422
00:27:47,011 --> 00:27:48,746
I'm just scared.

423
00:27:48,748 --> 00:27:51,383
Well, There's nothing
to be scared of anymore.

424
00:27:51,385 --> 00:27:54,088
We put the fire out.
Nobody's hurt.

425
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:55,791
Look.

426
00:27:55,793 --> 00:27:57,426
Even olive's okay.

427
00:27:57,428 --> 00:27:59,430
Just a little dirty,
that's all.

428
00:27:59,432 --> 00:28:01,635
See?

429
00:28:01,637 --> 00:28:02,903
Everything's gonna be okay.

430
00:28:02,905 --> 00:28:03,938
No, dad.

431
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,675
It's not.

432
00:28:05,677 --> 00:28:08,647
It's not gonna be okay.

433
00:28:08,649 --> 00:28:10,851
They're gonna see.

434
00:28:11,887 --> 00:28:13,088
Who?

435
00:28:14,023 --> 00:28:15,859
The breathers.

436
00:28:35,498 --> 00:28:36,999
My God.

437
00:28:50,158 --> 00:28:52,861
Mmm! Hello, bacon.

438
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:56,167
Where'd your little sous-chef
run off to?

439
00:28:56,169 --> 00:28:57,737
Upstairs, getting ready.

440
00:28:57,739 --> 00:28:59,005
Still?

441
00:28:59,007 --> 00:29:01,543
How long does it take
to put on a swimsuit?

442
00:29:01,545 --> 00:29:04,481
Long time when You're trying
to impress Joey.

443
00:29:04,483 --> 00:29:07,186
Joey? Yeah, he's coming
to the "y" with us.

444
00:29:07,188 --> 00:29:08,822
Joey Neary next door?

445
00:29:08,824 --> 00:29:11,727
He's a real cutie,
don't you think?

446
00:29:11,729 --> 00:29:13,664
I think he can barely
tie his own shoes.

447
00:29:13,666 --> 00:29:14,666
That's what I think.

448
00:29:14,668 --> 00:29:16,636
Joey Neary.

449
00:29:16,638 --> 00:29:18,740
Come on, you remember
young love, don't you?

450
00:29:18,742 --> 00:29:21,579
Yeah, well, I had definitely
outgrown nerf weapons

451
00:29:21,581 --> 00:29:22,822
by our first date.

452
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:25,919
I don't like this at all.

453
00:29:25,921 --> 00:29:27,488
Dad, why didn't you tell me?

454
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:29,024
What? Tell you what?

455
00:29:29,026 --> 00:29:30,259
That Joey's going on vacation.

456
00:29:30,261 --> 00:29:32,162
We were supposed to play
Marco polo.

457
00:29:32,164 --> 00:29:34,534
Well, that Can't be true, because
I talked to Jillian last night.

458
00:29:34,536 --> 00:29:36,638
Just leave it. We don't need it.

459
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,642
Come on. We have to.
Come on, come on.

460
00:29:38,644 --> 00:29:40,807
Leave everything there.
We got what we need.

461
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,522
Come on.

462
00:29:47,825 --> 00:29:48,859
Hey, Ted?

463
00:29:48,861 --> 00:29:49,927
That's good.

464
00:29:49,929 --> 00:29:51,195
Jillian?

465
00:29:51,197 --> 00:29:52,263
What else?

466
00:29:52,265 --> 00:29:53,868
Ted? Is everything okay?
Jillian?

467
00:29:55,572 --> 00:29:57,306
Hey, Joey. What's going on?

468
00:29:57,308 --> 00:29:58,842
I don't want to leave.
Why do you have to leave?

469
00:29:58,844 --> 00:30:00,311
The government man.

470
00:30:00,313 --> 00:30:03,551
He said... the virus.
It changes people bad.

471
00:30:03,553 --> 00:30:05,274
The what? What kind of virus?
Joey, come on.

472
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:05,821
We have to go.

473
00:30:05,823 --> 00:30:07,991
Jillian, where are you going? I'm
sorry, Claire. There's no time.

474
00:30:07,993 --> 00:30:10,095
What's happening? Just get Zoe and get
as far away from Kingsville as you can.

475
00:30:10,097 --> 00:30:11,998
Get in the car. Let's go.

476
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,870
Tell Zoe I'm sorry
I Can't play Marco polo!

477
00:30:16,842 --> 00:30:18,075
Ted!

478
00:30:18,077 --> 00:30:19,799
Can't go back for the others.

479
00:30:24,621 --> 00:30:26,864
Where's everyone going?

480
00:30:28,695 --> 00:30:30,777
Come on, Sandra. Just
pack that up! I'll do my best!

481
00:30:49,032 --> 00:30:51,101
The breathers.

482
00:30:51,103 --> 00:30:53,639
They're gonna see it,
aren't they?

483
00:30:54,808 --> 00:30:56,342
Aren't they?

484
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,414
Well, it's sundown.

485
00:30:59,416 --> 00:31:01,418
Maybe it's too dark
to see the smoke.

486
00:31:03,022 --> 00:31:04,758
Maybe.

487
00:31:32,312 --> 00:31:34,516
Can you see any smoke?

488
00:31:41,195 --> 00:31:43,831
Don't forget rule two, Claire.

489
00:31:43,833 --> 00:31:46,168
We have to stay calm. No matter what,
we have to stay under control.

490
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,938
We have to think.

491
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,142
Anyone within a mile of here
will have seen that smoke.

492
00:31:50,144 --> 00:31:52,279
The breathers are gonna
come for us. I know it.

493
00:31:52,281 --> 00:31:53,915
Zoe, let mom and I talk
for a minute, okay?

494
00:31:53,917 --> 00:31:55,985
But they're gonna find us,
just like olive dreamed.

495
00:31:55,987 --> 00:31:57,187
They're not gonna find us.
They might.

496
00:31:57,189 --> 00:31:59,057
Claire, stop.
Stop it? Stop what?

497
00:31:59,059 --> 00:32:00,459
I'm just trying to figure out
what the hell to do here, ray.

498
00:32:00,461 --> 00:32:01,795
We're not gonna do anything.

499
00:32:01,797 --> 00:32:03,297
Even if they see the smoke...

500
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:05,067
And I don't think they will...

501
00:32:05,069 --> 00:32:07,204
By the time they get here,
it'll be gone.

502
00:32:07,206 --> 00:32:08,907
They'll have no idea
where it came from.

503
00:32:08,909 --> 00:32:10,510
It won't matter...
They'll know We're here,

504
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:12,045
and they'll search the area
for us.

505
00:32:12,047 --> 00:32:13,447
So let them come.

506
00:32:13,449 --> 00:32:16,386
They've searched here
a dozen times before.

507
00:32:16,388 --> 00:32:18,289
They've never found us.

508
00:32:19,961 --> 00:32:22,063
And they're not
gonna find us<i> now.</i>

509
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,398
Dad's right.

510
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,470
We're still hidden.
I checked, remember?

511
00:32:26,472 --> 00:32:29,442
All agreed We're safe,
please raise your hand.

512
00:32:30,546 --> 00:32:32,314
Two against one.

513
00:32:32,316 --> 00:32:33,850
Three.

514
00:32:51,251 --> 00:32:53,087
What's wrong, mom?

515
00:32:57,362 --> 00:32:59,398
The wood's burned.

516
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,868
So?

517
00:33:03,373 --> 00:33:07,146
So burned wood makes ash.

518
00:33:16,497 --> 00:33:19,201
We're not hidden anymore...

519
00:33:19,203 --> 00:33:20,436
Are we?

520
00:33:20,438 --> 00:33:22,072
Oh, I don't think
they'll notice.

521
00:33:22,074 --> 00:33:23,608
Do you really
want to take that risk?

522
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:26,312
We don't have another choice.

523
00:33:26,314 --> 00:33:27,615
We cover the ash.

524
00:33:27,617 --> 00:33:29,050
How?

525
00:33:29,052 --> 00:33:31,287
We'd have to go
onto the surface.

526
00:33:31,289 --> 00:33:34,159
But what about the third rule?

527
00:33:34,161 --> 00:33:37,031
Never, ever open the door.

528
00:33:37,033 --> 00:33:40,070
Sometimes rules...

529
00:33:40,072 --> 00:33:42,140
Even mom rules...

530
00:33:42,142 --> 00:33:43,383
Have to be broken.

531
00:33:47,016 --> 00:33:48,484
Listen to me.

532
00:33:48,486 --> 00:33:50,522
If you hear anything up there,
anything but me and dad,

533
00:33:50,524 --> 00:33:52,593
I want you
to lock the door behind us.

534
00:33:52,595 --> 00:33:55,732
What? No, I'm going up there
with you. I'm gonna help.

535
00:33:55,734 --> 00:33:57,334
Out of the question, Zoso.

536
00:33:57,336 --> 00:34:00,440
It's "Zoe."
Stop treating me like a baby.

537
00:34:00,442 --> 00:34:02,110
I'm protecting you.

538
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:04,481
But what if
you need<i> me</i> to protect<i> you?</i>

539
00:34:04,483 --> 00:34:05,851
I can fight if I have to.

540
00:34:05,853 --> 00:34:08,121
No, you Can't.
My rules still apply to<i> you.</i>

541
00:34:08,123 --> 00:34:09,691
So no matter what happens
up there,

542
00:34:09,693 --> 00:34:12,195
no matter what you hear,

543
00:34:12,197 --> 00:34:13,865
do not open the door.

544
00:34:13,867 --> 00:34:15,234
But...

545
00:34:15,236 --> 00:34:18,106
I need you to promise me that.

546
00:34:18,108 --> 00:34:19,576
Promise.

547
00:34:21,547 --> 00:34:23,482
Promise.

548
00:34:33,904 --> 00:34:35,605
We'll have to move fast.

549
00:34:35,607 --> 00:34:38,611
I don't wanna be out there
for more than three minutes.

550
00:34:38,613 --> 00:34:41,449
Three minutes.

551
00:34:41,451 --> 00:34:43,486
Okay.

552
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:16,949
They're going this way, olive.

553
00:35:16,951 --> 00:35:18,451
Come on.

554
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,784
No. I don't know
where they went.

555
00:36:47,154 --> 00:36:49,023
It's just them, olive.

556
00:36:49,025 --> 00:36:50,726
They're okay.

557
00:37:00,912 --> 00:37:02,581
Mom! Dad!

558
00:37:02,583 --> 00:37:04,918
Look out behind you!

559
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,590
Mom! Dad!

560
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:08,858
Hurry!

561
00:37:42,822 --> 00:37:44,590
Dad!

562
00:37:47,495 --> 00:37:49,164
Mom! Dad!

563
00:37:54,775 --> 00:37:56,844
Dad!

564
00:37:56,846 --> 00:37:58,647
Mom!

565
00:37:58,649 --> 00:38:00,584
Dad!

566
00:38:02,088 --> 00:38:03,823
What the hell are you doing?

567
00:38:03,825 --> 00:38:06,108
I told you to stay inside.

568
00:38:07,297 --> 00:38:08,865
Slow down.
We Can't understand you.

569
00:38:08,867 --> 00:38:10,602
Breathers!

570
00:38:10,604 --> 00:38:11,637
Look out!

571
00:38:17,849 --> 00:38:19,918
It's just deer, Zoe.

572
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,723
Nothing to be scared of.

573
00:38:22,725 --> 00:38:24,192
Just Bambi.

574
00:38:25,696 --> 00:38:27,699
They looked scared.

575
00:38:27,701 --> 00:38:29,134
Aw, don't be silly.

576
00:38:29,136 --> 00:38:32,306
She's right, ray.
They're running away.

577
00:38:33,743 --> 00:38:36,065
Running away from something.

578
00:38:44,261 --> 00:38:47,132
We have to
get back in the shelter.

579
00:38:58,888 --> 00:39:00,089
Careful.

580
00:39:45,076 --> 00:39:47,345
What happened?
Did you see something?

581
00:39:47,347 --> 00:39:49,248
Be quiet! Quiet.

582
00:39:57,096 --> 00:39:59,733
What is it, dad?

583
00:40:03,074 --> 00:40:05,944
Footsteps.

584
00:40:21,407 --> 00:40:22,474
I think it's just one.

585
00:40:22,476 --> 00:40:23,977
Why? Why just one?

586
00:40:23,979 --> 00:40:25,547
They've always traveled
in groups before.

587
00:40:25,549 --> 00:40:28,151
I don't know.

588
00:40:28,153 --> 00:40:30,676
Maybe he's the only one
who saw the smoke.

589
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:36,298
He's headed this way.

590
00:40:39,874 --> 00:40:41,542
Zoso, we have to stay quiet.

591
00:40:41,544 --> 00:40:43,812
Rule number one, remember?
Never be loud.

592
00:40:43,814 --> 00:40:46,149
I know. I-I'm trying.

593
00:40:46,151 --> 00:40:47,273
Try harder.

594
00:40:49,023 --> 00:40:50,490
If he hears us,
he will find us.

595
00:40:50,492 --> 00:40:52,227
Do you understand me?
Do you understand me?

596
00:40:52,229 --> 00:40:54,197
Zoe, Zoe, Zoe.

597
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:56,334
Zoe, come here.

598
00:40:56,336 --> 00:40:59,206
Have a seat.

599
00:41:01,913 --> 00:41:04,215
What do you say
we get out of here?

600
00:41:04,217 --> 00:41:05,918
'Cause look what I found.

601
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,986
With this car...

602
00:41:09,324 --> 00:41:11,528
You can go anywhere you want.

603
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:13,397
Anywhere in the world.

604
00:41:13,399 --> 00:41:15,033
Any time.

605
00:41:17,038 --> 00:41:19,141
Where do you want to go?

606
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,111
My bed. Yeah?

607
00:41:21,113 --> 00:41:22,146
My old bed.

608
00:41:22,148 --> 00:41:23,181
Yeah.

609
00:41:23,183 --> 00:41:25,886
That's an excellent choice.

610
00:41:25,888 --> 00:41:28,090
Okay. Okay.

611
00:41:31,498 --> 00:41:34,001
Ka-plop.

612
00:41:34,003 --> 00:41:36,906
You collapse on your bed...

613
00:41:36,908 --> 00:41:40,412
Exhausted after a long day.

614
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:43,484
And you pull
those warm pink polka dot sheets

615
00:41:43,486 --> 00:41:46,089
all the way up to your eyes.

616
00:41:50,498 --> 00:41:53,302
You hug
all your stuffed animals.

617
00:41:55,173 --> 00:42:00,616
Puffy bear, duck duck,
Cathypillar.

618
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:02,686
Kissing them good night.

619
00:42:11,269 --> 00:42:13,539
You can feel the fan
on your nightstand

620
00:42:13,541 --> 00:42:16,611
blowing a soft breeze
through your hair.

621
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:27,163
And then you look up
at the ceiling above you,

622
00:42:27,165 --> 00:42:30,301
where we hung
those glow-in-the-dark stars...

623
00:42:32,372 --> 00:42:35,310
And they shine for you.

624
00:42:35,312 --> 00:42:38,784
So There's always light...

625
00:42:38,786 --> 00:42:41,121
Even when you sleep.

626
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:46,231
Even when you dream.

627
00:42:52,276 --> 00:42:54,178
Are you there?

628
00:42:55,815 --> 00:42:57,818
Yeah.

629
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,821
I'm there.

630
00:43:03,161 --> 00:43:05,329
Can you see the stars?

631
00:43:10,174 --> 00:43:11,642
Mm.

632
00:43:46,676 --> 00:43:49,847
Let it go, let it go.

633
00:45:13,872 --> 00:45:16,877
<i>My smile is stuck.</i>

634
00:45:16,879 --> 00:45:19,181
<i>Stuck. Stuck. Stuck. Stuck.</i>

635
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:22,420
<i>Stuck. Stuck. Stuck. Stuck.</i>

636
00:45:22,422 --> 00:45:25,125
<i>Stuck. Stuck.</i>
<i>Stuck. Stuck. Stuck. Stuck.</i>

637
00:45:25,127 --> 00:45:28,665
<i>Stuck. Stuck. Stuck. Stuck.</i>
<i>Stuck. Stuck. Stuck. Stuck.</i>

638
00:45:28,667 --> 00:45:31,837
<i>Stuck.</i>
<i>Stuck. Stuck. Stuck. Stuck.</i>

639
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:35,043
<i>Stuck. Stuck. Stuck. Stuck.</i>
<i>Stuck. Stuck. Stuck. Stuck.</i>

640
00:45:35,045 --> 00:45:37,213
<i>Stuck. Stuck. Stuck. Stuck.</i>

641
00:45:46,097 --> 00:45:47,999
No.

642
00:45:48,001 --> 00:45:50,771
Please. Please fit in.

643
00:46:06,602 --> 00:46:08,771
He Can't get in here, can he?

644
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:13,112
Hold fast, right, dad?

645
00:46:21,829 --> 00:46:23,096
He's too strong!

646
00:46:25,836 --> 00:46:28,318
We need something
to brace the door!

647
00:46:30,209 --> 00:46:31,744
Something tough.

648
00:46:31,746 --> 00:46:34,081
Go! Go!

649
00:46:46,038 --> 00:46:47,139
Mom, you Can't go up there!

650
00:46:47,141 --> 00:46:48,307
Just tell dad to hurry!

651
00:46:48,309 --> 00:46:49,810
Dad! Hurry!

652
00:46:49,812 --> 00:46:50,945
I<i> am</i> hurrying!

653
00:47:01,934 --> 00:47:03,067
Unh!

654
00:47:03,069 --> 00:47:04,870
Mom, are you okay?!

655
00:47:04,872 --> 00:47:07,241
I'm okay! Just stay down there!

656
00:47:07,243 --> 00:47:08,343
Dad, hurry!

657
00:47:08,345 --> 00:47:10,146
God!

658
00:47:16,358 --> 00:47:17,793
Ray!

659
00:47:25,643 --> 00:47:28,078
He's almost through!

660
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,850
Hold on!

661
00:47:30,852 --> 00:47:31,852
Dad!

662
00:47:31,854 --> 00:47:33,321
Watch out!

663
00:47:34,358 --> 00:47:35,792
Ray, give me the pipe!

664
00:47:35,794 --> 00:47:37,227
Wedge it under the handle!

665
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:38,663
Watch out, mom!

666
00:47:56,863 --> 00:47:57,929
Watch out, Claire!

667
00:47:59,233 --> 00:48:01,068
Die!

668
00:48:04,409 --> 00:48:06,344
Ray!

669
00:48:06,346 --> 00:48:08,114
Ray!

670
00:48:09,786 --> 00:48:11,286
Ray!

671
00:48:12,323 --> 00:48:13,356
Ray!

672
00:48:17,733 --> 00:48:20,102
Ray! Ray! He's not getting in!

673
00:48:20,104 --> 00:48:21,905
He's not getting in!

674
00:48:21,907 --> 00:48:23,173
It'll hold!

675
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:27,247
It will.

676
00:48:27,249 --> 00:48:28,250
Okay?

677
00:48:29,319 --> 00:48:30,360
Okay.

678
00:48:31,489 --> 00:48:32,857
Hey.

679
00:48:34,862 --> 00:48:36,798
Hey.

680
00:48:47,318 --> 00:48:49,187
Hold fast?

681
00:48:51,526 --> 00:48:53,427
Hold fast.

682
00:49:33,037 --> 00:49:35,273
He's still up there.

683
00:49:35,275 --> 00:49:37,511
Why isn't he leaving?

684
00:49:37,513 --> 00:49:41,050
Why won't he just go away?

685
00:49:41,052 --> 00:49:42,887
I don't know.

686
00:49:47,262 --> 00:49:50,267
He's up to something.

687
00:49:50,269 --> 00:49:53,574
What could he be up to?

688
00:49:53,576 --> 00:49:56,378
Why is he still standing there?

689
00:50:33,449 --> 00:50:35,350
<i>That's</i> what he's doing.

690
00:50:36,721 --> 00:50:38,222
He's waiting.

691
00:50:38,224 --> 00:50:41,228
Waiting for what?

692
00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:42,998
The rest of them.

693
00:51:25,615 --> 00:51:27,183
Hey, look, Zoe, there it is.

694
00:51:27,185 --> 00:51:29,521
The water tower over there...
You see it?

695
00:51:31,592 --> 00:51:33,427
So once We're past that,
We're out of Kingsville.

696
00:51:33,429 --> 00:51:36,266
Then we'll be safe?
Safe from the sick people?

697
00:51:36,268 --> 00:51:38,831
That's right, sweetie.
Safe from the sick people.

698
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:58,271
Why are all those people
headed back?

699
00:51:58,273 --> 00:52:00,141
I don't know.

700
00:52:01,344 --> 00:52:03,380
I thought you said
we couldn't stay,

701
00:52:03,382 --> 00:52:05,283
that it was dangerous.

702
00:52:05,285 --> 00:52:06,687
Maybe everything's okay now.

703
00:52:06,688 --> 00:52:08,321
You think that's possible?

704
00:52:08,323 --> 00:52:09,557
I don't know.

705
00:52:12,697 --> 00:52:14,632
Got to be able
to get something here.

706
00:52:14,634 --> 00:52:16,234
Maybe A.M.?

707
00:52:18,574 --> 00:52:19,775
Ray, watch out!

708
00:52:24,884 --> 00:52:27,821
Let us out!
There's nowhere else to go!

709
00:52:30,528 --> 00:52:31,929

00:53:00,849 --> 00:53:03,384
Mom, what's a "core and tine"?

725
00:53:04,353 --> 00:53:06,590
Quarantine.

726
00:53:06,592 --> 00:53:08,961
It means
they're not letting us out.

727
00:53:08,963 --> 00:53:10,731
You mean We're trapped in here?

728
00:53:10,733 --> 00:53:12,901
<i>The CDC is working closely</i>
<i>with the national guard.</i>

729
00:53:12,903 --> 00:53:14,144
<i>To support the deployment...</i>

730
00:53:16,975 --> 00:53:18,544
<i>You will receive</i>
<i>further notification.</i>

731
00:53:18,546 --> 00:53:19,879
<i>Of the response teams...</i>

732
00:53:25,155 --> 00:53:26,891
Get back!

733
00:53:52,806 --> 00:53:56,512
Mom. Dad.

734
00:53:56,514 --> 00:53:57,780
They're here.

735
00:54:30,979 --> 00:54:33,014
Darlene's not gonna hold!

736
00:54:33,016 --> 00:54:35,084
We need something else!

737
00:54:35,086 --> 00:54:36,687
Go!

738
00:54:47,843 --> 00:54:49,945
Run!

739
00:54:54,321 --> 00:54:56,924
Get Zoe to the bedroom!
Go! Hold on!

740
00:55:02,033 --> 00:55:04,604
That's not gonna last long.

741
00:55:04,606 --> 00:55:06,808
Ray, help me!

742
00:55:17,194 --> 00:55:19,330
How long is that gonna last?!
Couple of minutes.

743
00:55:19,332 --> 00:55:20,332
We've got to get out of here!

744
00:55:20,334 --> 00:55:21,768
They're blocking the door!

745
00:55:21,770 --> 00:55:22,936
Mom, dad.

746
00:55:22,938 --> 00:55:24,860
The door's
not the only way out.

747
00:55:28,948 --> 00:55:30,684
The periscope!

748
00:55:34,391 --> 00:55:36,293
I think we can fit. I don't
know about you, ray.

749
00:55:36,295 --> 00:55:38,230
I'll be fine. Just...

750
00:55:38,232 --> 00:55:40,635
Hurry.

751
00:56:06,684 --> 00:56:07,951
Dad! Claire!

752
00:56:07,953 --> 00:56:09,854
Okay, ray. It's clear.
Get Zoso.

753
00:56:09,856 --> 00:56:12,225
You ready? Get Zoso!

754
00:56:12,227 --> 00:56:13,828
Come on.

755
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:14,930
Ray, now!

756
00:56:14,932 --> 00:56:15,998
Here, watch your head.

757
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,922
Take your mom's hand! No!

758
00:56:19,774 --> 00:56:21,136
You got her? Got her!

759
00:56:29,122 --> 00:56:30,965
Okay, ray, she's up. Come on.

760
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:39,305
I Can't fit.

761
00:56:48,089 --> 00:56:49,423
I Can't fit.

762
00:56:49,425 --> 00:56:51,895
Oh, come on!

763
00:56:53,533 --> 00:56:55,267
Claire, grab my wrist!

764
00:56:55,269 --> 00:56:56,803
What? Grab it!

765
00:56:56,805 --> 00:56:58,807
Hold tight.

766
00:57:02,381 --> 00:57:04,303
Oh, God! Dad!

767
00:57:05,854 --> 00:57:06,920
Dad! Dad!

768
00:57:06,922 --> 00:57:08,823
Aah! God!

769
00:57:08,825 --> 00:57:09,825
Are you okay?!

770
00:57:09,827 --> 00:57:12,362
I'm o...

771
00:57:12,364 --> 00:57:14,265
I'm okay.

772
00:57:35,339 --> 00:57:36,541
No, daddy! Come on!

773
00:57:36,543 --> 00:57:38,243
Ray!

774
00:57:38,245 --> 00:57:40,280
Remember our promise.

775
00:57:40,282 --> 00:57:41,583
Zoe comes first.

776
00:57:45,993 --> 00:57:47,226
Aah!

777
00:57:52,204 --> 00:57:54,339
Come on.

778
00:57:54,341 --> 00:57:56,544
Come on!

779
00:57:56,546 --> 00:57:58,313
No! Ray!

780
00:57:58,315 --> 00:58:00,250
No, daddy! Oh, ray!

781
00:58:00,252 --> 00:58:01,519
Oh, God, help!

782
00:58:03,156 --> 00:58:05,024
Daddy! Daddy!

783
00:58:06,562 --> 00:58:08,195
Ohh! God!

784
00:58:10,066 --> 00:58:11,300
Daddy!

785
00:58:11,302 --> 00:58:13,337
No! No! Dad! Let me go!

786
00:58:13,339 --> 00:58:15,074
We can help him!

787
00:58:15,076 --> 00:58:17,044
I promised him that I would
protect you! No! No!

788
00:58:17,046 --> 00:58:19,181
I promised him that I would protect you!
I don't care!

789
00:58:19,183 --> 00:58:20,183
I promised him!

790
00:58:20,185 --> 00:58:21,218
I hate you!

791
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:23,255
I hate you!

792
00:58:23,257 --> 00:58:26,227
It's okay. It's okay. I just
...I just... let me go.

793
00:58:26,229 --> 00:58:28,030
It's okay.

794
00:58:36,379 --> 00:58:38,081
We have to run.

795
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:40,351
Run!

796
00:58:50,104 --> 00:58:51,104
Olive! Olive!

797
00:58:51,106 --> 00:58:52,239
Zoso! Come back!

798
00:58:54,679 --> 00:58:58,216
Run!

799
00:59:14,246 --> 00:59:15,548
Are you okay, honey?

800
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:17,552
Yeah, I'm okay.

801
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:18,554
Come on.

802
00:59:18,556 --> 00:59:20,123
Come on.

803
00:59:28,339 --> 00:59:30,576
Where... where are we?

804
00:59:31,779 --> 00:59:34,817
Where it all started.

805
00:59:50,513 --> 00:59:52,281
What do we do?!

806
00:59:52,283 --> 00:59:54,184
Run! Keep running!

807
01:00:09,479 --> 01:00:11,482
The breathers! They're coming!

808
01:00:22,203 --> 01:00:24,006
She dreamed they found us.

809
01:00:27,781 --> 01:00:30,143
They're still looking for us.

810
01:00:35,394 --> 01:00:36,796
They hate us a lot, don't they?

811
01:00:36,798 --> 01:00:38,699
To keep hunting us like that.

812
01:00:38,701 --> 01:00:40,602
They've always
traveled in groups before.

813
01:00:40,604 --> 01:00:41,937
Yeah, well, I can fight them.

814
01:00:41,939 --> 01:00:43,339
That's suicide,
and you know it.

815
01:00:43,341 --> 01:00:44,542
What's a "core and tine"?

816
01:00:44,544 --> 01:00:45,677
It means
they're not letting us out.

817
01:00:45,679 --> 01:00:47,947
The breathers.

818
01:01:20,779 --> 01:01:22,547
Let us go!

819
01:01:23,584 --> 01:01:24,666
Let us go!

820
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:29,458
Let us go! Let us out!

821
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:30,894
No!

822
01:01:53,035 --> 01:01:56,774
Mom, it's an earthquake.

823
01:01:56,776 --> 01:01:59,946
No, sweetie, it Can't be.

824
01:01:59,948 --> 01:02:02,417
Kingsville
doesn't have earthquakes.

825
01:02:13,775 --> 01:02:16,512
Why the hell
does the CDC need military jets?

826
01:02:16,514 --> 01:02:18,014
They're turning around.

827
01:02:30,839 --> 01:02:34,545
They just told everyone
to go back into town.

828
01:02:35,849 --> 01:02:37,684
Mom, dad, they're coming!

829
01:02:40,958 --> 01:02:43,026
Come on!
We got to get out of here!

830
01:02:43,028 --> 01:02:44,261
Come on, come on, come on!

831
01:02:44,263 --> 01:02:46,666
No, no, no!
Too far to walk there!

832
01:02:52,242 --> 01:02:54,579
Kingsville elementary! What?!

833
01:02:54,581 --> 01:02:56,114
There's a fallout shelter
out back!

834
01:02:56,116 --> 01:02:57,517
But I don't know if it's safe.

835
01:02:57,519 --> 01:02:59,286
Well, it's safer than here.
Come on.

836
01:02:59,288 --> 01:03:00,955
Come on!

837
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:13,303
Got to go, guys. Go.

838
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:27,068
Where is it? There!

839
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:28,633
Where's the door?! There!

840
01:03:37,621 --> 01:03:40,257
- They're coming! Hurry!
- Ray, hurry!

841
01:03:44,766 --> 01:03:46,668
Let's go. Come on. I got you.

842
01:03:46,670 --> 01:03:48,992
All right, come on! Come on!

843
01:03:51,713 --> 01:03:53,346
Claire! Shut it now!

844
01:04:08,241 --> 01:04:09,910
Are you okay?

845
01:04:09,912 --> 01:04:11,680
Claire, are you okay?

846
01:04:13,083 --> 01:04:16,088
Yeah, I'm okay.

847
01:04:16,090 --> 01:04:17,123
Are you guys?

848
01:04:17,125 --> 01:04:18,391
Yeah. Yeah.

849
01:04:18,393 --> 01:04:20,228
Yeah, We're...

850
01:04:20,230 --> 01:04:21,263
We're okay.

851
01:04:21,265 --> 01:04:23,267
We're okay.

852
01:04:42,368 --> 01:04:44,204
Ohh.

853
01:04:46,175 --> 01:04:48,946
Oh, they have everything here.

854
01:04:57,864 --> 01:04:59,867
Look at all this food.

855
01:05:06,246 --> 01:05:08,449
Hey, Zoe.

856
01:05:10,855 --> 01:05:12,757
Look at all this.

857
01:05:14,762 --> 01:05:16,162
Huh?

858
01:05:19,537 --> 01:05:21,540
There's...

859
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:23,810
There's books and games and...

860
01:05:23,812 --> 01:05:24,978
Hey, dad?

861
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:26,146
More toys, that...

862
01:05:26,148 --> 01:05:27,549
Ye... yeah?

863
01:05:29,921 --> 01:05:32,243
How long
do we have to stay here?

864
01:05:35,096 --> 01:05:38,969
I... I don't know.

865
01:05:38,971 --> 01:05:42,475
Not... hopefully not very long.

866
01:05:42,477 --> 01:05:45,247
W-we just got to wait
till they clear this up.

867
01:05:45,249 --> 01:05:46,550
And then...

868
01:05:48,487 --> 01:05:50,557
Honey, w...

869
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:54,130
What happened up there
was a mistake.

870
01:05:54,132 --> 01:05:58,606
It's a terrible,
t-terrible mistake.

871
01:05:58,608 --> 01:06:01,010
It wasn't a mistake.

872
01:06:05,385 --> 01:06:07,622
The shelter door cut me.

873
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:12,364
The virus
must have gone airborne.

874
01:06:12,366 --> 01:06:14,167
We're infected.

875
01:06:31,232 --> 01:06:32,567
Please, just let us go.

876
01:06:32,569 --> 01:06:34,537
No! Just let us go.

877
01:06:34,539 --> 01:06:36,273
You cooperate,
answer my questions,

878
01:06:36,275 --> 01:06:38,243
I'll do what I can
to help you and your daughter.

879
01:06:38,245 --> 01:06:39,278
Do you understand?

880
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:41,382
Yes, yes.

881
01:06:41,384 --> 01:06:43,587
That shelter we found you in.
How long have you been there?

882
01:06:43,589 --> 01:06:45,289
Since the beginning.

883
01:06:45,291 --> 01:06:47,159
Did you ever come into contact
with anyone else?

884
01:06:47,161 --> 01:06:48,494
Family? Neighbors?
It was only us.

885
01:06:48,496 --> 01:06:51,132
Dad says
We're the only ones left.

886
01:06:52,201 --> 01:06:53,970
"Zoe."

887
01:06:53,972 --> 01:06:58,377
I have a little girl
about your age.

888
01:06:58,379 --> 01:07:01,116
Goddamn shame.

889
01:07:04,524 --> 01:07:06,191
No!

890
01:07:06,193 --> 01:07:08,395
What are you doing?
You said you would help us.

891
01:07:08,397 --> 01:07:10,633
On my order. I won't
let you touch her.

892
01:07:10,635 --> 01:07:12,369
I won't let you touch her!

893
01:07:12,371 --> 01:07:13,471
I will not let you touch her!

894
01:07:13,473 --> 01:07:14,607
I won't let you touch her!

895
01:07:14,609 --> 01:07:16,176
I will not let you touch her!

896
01:07:16,178 --> 01:07:17,244
I will not let you touch her!

897
01:07:17,246 --> 01:07:18,346
Mom, never lose control!

898
01:07:18,348 --> 01:07:20,149
Keep away! It's too dangerous!

899
01:07:20,151 --> 01:07:21,986
Keep away, keep away,
keep away!

900
01:07:21,988 --> 01:07:23,622
Remember rule number two...
Never lose control.

901
01:07:23,624 --> 01:07:25,358
Keep away.

902
01:07:27,230 --> 01:07:28,664
Don't forget rule two, Claire.

903
01:07:28,666 --> 01:07:30,466
No matter what,
we have to stay under control.

904
01:07:30,468 --> 01:07:32,169
We have to stay calm.

905
01:07:32,171 --> 01:07:33,639
Never let anger take over.

906
01:07:33,641 --> 01:07:36,043
No, no, no!

907
01:07:36,045 --> 01:07:37,679
They're different than we are,
and that makes them

908
01:07:37,681 --> 01:07:39,181
as scared of us
as we are of them.

909
01:07:39,183 --> 01:07:40,784
We're not animals.

910
01:07:40,786 --> 01:07:42,521
Sometimes
the truth's hidden from us.

911
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:05,161

Take him out!

914
01:08:34,882 --> 01:08:37,285
<i>All stations, this is echo one.</i>

915
01:08:37,287 --> 01:08:38,655
<i>Target secure. Target secure.</i>

916
01:08:38,657 --> 01:08:40,224

917
01:08:40,226 --> 01:08:41,560
<i>Four casualties.</i>
<i>Two targets contained.</i>

918
01:08:41,562 --> 01:08:43,296

920
01:08:44,901 --> 01:08:46,836
<i>Support is on the way.</i>

921
01:09:40,035 --> 01:09:41,603
Run! Mommy!

922
01:10:21,577 --> 01:10:23,546
Stop!

923
01:10:23,548 --> 01:10:25,583
You don't have to kill him.
It's okay.

924
01:10:25,585 --> 01:10:26,952
We're sa...

925
01:10:26,954 --> 01:10:28,689
Aah!

926
01:10:28,691 --> 01:10:30,058
Remember rule number two, Zoso?

927
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:31,995
Remember rule number two.
You can stop it.

928
01:10:31,997 --> 01:10:33,999
You can stop it.
You can stop it, Zoso.

929
01:10:34,001 --> 01:10:35,067
You can stop it.

930
01:10:35,069 --> 01:10:36,770
Zoe. That's it.

931
01:10:36,772 --> 01:10:37,973
Come back to me.

932
01:10:38,842 --> 01:10:39,908
Come back to me.

933
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:41,878
Zoe.

934
01:10:44,116 --> 01:10:45,785
That's it, that's it.

935
01:10:50,026 --> 01:10:51,928
Hey.

936
01:10:51,930 --> 01:10:53,765
Mom.

937
01:10:53,767 --> 01:10:56,102
Yeah. It's me.

938
01:10:57,606 --> 01:11:00,242
You saved me. Protected me.

939
01:11:00,244 --> 01:11:02,212
I know.

940
01:11:02,214 --> 01:11:04,082
You called me "Zoe." I know.

941
01:11:04,084 --> 01:11:05,585
Come here.

942
01:11:11,096 --> 01:11:12,531
Hey, come on.

943
01:11:12,533 --> 01:11:14,501
We got to go.

944
01:11:14,503 --> 01:11:15,836
Careful.

945
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:18,073
You're hurt.

946
01:11:18,075 --> 01:11:20,043
Here.

947
01:11:21,647 --> 01:11:23,750
Thank you.

948
01:11:30,295 --> 01:11:32,539
What do we do with him?

949
01:11:33,567 --> 01:11:34,768
We let him live.

950
01:11:54,806 --> 01:11:56,642
Mom.

951
01:11:56,644 --> 01:11:58,144
Look.

952
01:12:03,021 --> 01:12:04,121
Daddy!

953
01:12:05,892 --> 01:12:07,594
Daddy.

954
01:12:32,075 --> 01:12:34,244
I love you.

955
01:12:36,115 --> 01:12:38,051
I love you.

956
01:12:55,019 --> 01:12:57,022
Daddy.

957
01:12:58,325 --> 01:13:00,227
I'm not leaving you.

958
01:13:03,802 --> 01:13:05,403
And if...

959
01:13:05,405 --> 01:13:08,075
I know I'm not going far.

960
01:13:12,217 --> 01:13:16,490
You can always visit me. Hm?

961
01:13:16,492 --> 01:13:18,260
Yeah.

962
01:13:20,398 --> 01:13:26,442
J-j-just t-take a tri... trip.

963
01:13:37,030 --> 01:13:39,033
Ohh.

964
01:13:40,837 --> 01:13:42,840
Dad?

965
01:13:42,842 --> 01:13:44,242
Are you there?

966
01:13:46,815 --> 01:13:48,449
Are you there?

967
01:13:57,934 --> 01:14:00,337
No, daddy!

968
01:14:04,012 --> 01:14:06,248
No! No!

969
01:14:12,093 --> 01:14:15,064
No! No!

970
01:14:24,047 --> 01:14:26,016
We Can't stay here, sweetie.

971
01:14:26,018 --> 01:14:27,451
We have to go.

972
01:14:27,453 --> 01:14:29,421
Where?

973
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:30,857
We have to hide.

974
01:15:38,757 --> 01:15:41,160
Mom? Mom?

975
01:15:42,264 --> 01:15:44,700
Are you awake?

976
01:15:44,702 --> 01:15:46,402
Mom? Mom?

977
01:15:48,274 --> 01:15:50,442
Zoe.

978
01:15:50,444 --> 01:15:52,680
What are you doing up already?

979
01:15:52,682 --> 01:15:54,349
Go back to sleep.

980
01:15:54,351 --> 01:15:56,119
I Can't.

981
01:15:56,121 --> 01:15:59,325
Olive is scared.

982
01:16:06,707 --> 01:16:09,077
What is it?

983
01:16:09,079 --> 01:16:10,547
What's wrong with olive?

984
01:16:10,549 --> 01:16:13,285
We heard something.
I think a breather's coming.

985
01:16:13,287 --> 01:16:15,810
No, sweetie. You just had
another nightmare.

986
01:16:16,726 --> 01:16:18,627
Quick, hide down.

987
01:16:18,629 --> 01:16:20,764
Marco!

988
01:16:20,766 --> 01:16:22,433
Marco!

989
01:16:22,435 --> 01:16:24,202
Polo?

990
01:16:27,442 --> 01:16:30,413
Joey Neary?

991
01:16:30,415 --> 01:16:33,085
I found you.

992
01:17:01,373 --> 01:17:04,344
Who's down there?

993
01:17:10,288 --> 01:17:12,424
Joey, where've you been?

994
01:17:13,326 --> 01:17:14,561
My God.

995
01:17:16,666 --> 01:17:18,300
Ted.

996
01:17:22,509 --> 01:17:24,377
Wait. Oh, come on.
No, it's okay.

997
01:17:24,379 --> 01:17:27,050
Are they all different like us?

998
01:17:27,052 --> 01:17:30,590
Yeah. But it's normal here.

999
01:17:33,496 --> 01:17:35,364
Come on.

1000
01:17:41,611 --> 01:17:43,580
Do you see it?

1001
01:17:43,582 --> 01:17:44,982
See what?

1002
01:17:46,653 --> 01:17:48,321
The sun.

1003
01:17:52,797 --> 01:17:55,467
That means it's 302 now.

1004
01:17:55,469 --> 01:17:58,941
302 days.

1005
01:17:58,943 --> 01:18:01,579
Not days.
