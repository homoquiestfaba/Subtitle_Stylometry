Do you care to make a comment

00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:15,989
Well, building a wall between the US
and Mexico will go a long way

132
00:11:15,991 --> 00:11:19,322
in keeping the criminal element
and the drugs out of our country.

00:11:19,324 --> 00:11:23,989
The Times, Senator. Are you saying that
all Latinos are criminals?

[chuckles] Far from it.

Actually, our neighbors here to the south
are both proud and ambitious people.

We can't fault them
for a few bad apples now, can we?

137
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:34,197
Well, then, how do you expect
the tax payers to pay for the wall

138
00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:37,449
when there are so many pressing issues
facing California.

139

Where there's will, I see opportunity.

140
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:43,239
And you can tell those tax payers
I will not be fitting them for that bill.

00:11:43,241 --> 00:11:45,906
- Thank you.
- Well then, Senator, tell me Senator...

So, please tell me
what is the DEA doing down here,

148
00:12:16,324 --> 00:12:19,157
because I do not see us winning
this war on drugs.

As a matter of fact,
we have a couple things in motion.

to get a hold of your office.

00:13:56,366 --> 00:14:00,574
The agency, and the United States
of America have a vested interest

175
00:14:01,032 --> 00:14:03,197
in the stability of our neighbors.

176
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,988
They are far better, far better equipped
to determine what is best

177
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:08,656
for regional stability than you.

178
00:14:08,658 --> 00:14:12,825
We do not need tourists running around
meddling in local affairs.

179
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:17,032
Listen, Capitan is doubling
his production.

180
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,406
He'll be bringing him a product
that I've never...

181
00:14:20,408 --> 00:14:22,990
Oh, so this was a righteous robbery,
is that what you're trying to tell me?

182
00:14:23,324 --> 00:14:25,074
So, what's the agency doing about this?

183
00:14:25,408 --> 00:14:29,364
And your big plan
was to bring down the Capitan

184
00:14:29,366 --> 00:14:32,616
by robbing one of his bakers
in a bathroom?

185
00:14:32,907 --> 00:14:34,907
Well, seemed like a good place to start.

186
00:14:36,241 --> 00:14:37,656
You're insane.

187
00:14:37,658 --> 00:14:39,741
Maybe, but...

188
00:14:40,032 --> 00:14:43,408
[clears throat] I've been called worse,
even by you.

189
00:14:45,533 --> 00:14:48,074
You're being extradited hot shot. [sighs]

190
00:14:50,116 --> 00:14:52,741
For what? What attempted robbery?

191
00:14:53,408 --> 00:14:55,947
They're sending you to one
of the worst prisons in Mexico.

192
00:14:55,949 --> 00:14:58,408
Being an American
will not be a good thing in there.

193
00:14:59,824 --> 00:15:02,406
You survive those three days,
I'll speak to the Senator.

194
00:15:02,408 --> 00:15:04,531
I'll see what he can do
to get you back to the United States.

195
00:15:04,533 --> 00:15:07,116
You face the music,
it's the best I can do.

196
00:15:09,907 --> 00:15:11,199
Okay, all right.

197
00:15:12,116 --> 00:15:14,700
So, um, Price, what do you know
about this prison?

198
00:15:39,782 --> 00:15:41,782
[in Spanish] You are nothing but a rat!

199
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,241
You're a rat.

200
00:15:45,324 --> 00:15:46,739
And like a rat you are going to die...

201
00:15:46,741 --> 00:15:47,782
Am I interrupting?

202
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,865
My love, not at all.

203
00:15:56,366 --> 00:16:00,157
I thought you'd like to see the color
of the napkins for the main table.

204
00:16:07,282 --> 00:16:09,658
I think this one is happier.

205
00:16:10,782 --> 00:16:14,740
Will your friend be joining us
for the party tomorrow? I need to know.

206
00:16:25,907 --> 00:16:27,241
He'll be leaving us today.

207
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:32,824
Okay.

208
00:16:35,574 --> 00:16:36,907
[grim music playing]

209
00:17:07,366 --> 00:17:08,533
[cocks gun]

210
00:17:41,574 --> 00:17:43,157
[music intensifies]

211
00:17:56,865 --> 00:17:58,282
[in Spanish] You're dead meat, gringo.

212
00:18:34,949 --> 00:18:35,907
[opens door lock]

213
00:18:50,408 --> 00:18:51,782
[locks door]

214
00:19:07,116 --> 00:19:08,282
Cozy.

215
00:19:20,366 --> 00:19:22,865
Hey Billy, look at all this cash.

216
00:19:28,657 --> 00:19:30,032
Well, it doesn't matter.

217
00:19:31,573 --> 00:19:33,988
Look at where he's hiding it.
There's no way we're getting in there.

218
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,740
Maybe that's why he got himself arrested.

219
00:19:36,573 --> 00:19:39,032
Well, maybe it's time you break up
with Jack.

220
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:43,366
Oh, maybe that's why
he didn't tell us sooner.

221
00:19:45,199 --> 00:19:46,199
Look...

222
00:19:47,074 --> 00:19:49,822
if you want to go follow him
into an early grave,

223
00:19:49,824 --> 00:19:51,157
fine, do it, be my guest.

224
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,239
But not me, I'm done, I'm out.

225
00:19:53,241 --> 00:19:55,116
Hey, hey, you're not getting off
that easy.

226
00:19:58,449 --> 00:19:59,699
Let me call Price.

227
00:20:02,408 --> 00:20:05,116
Every time I say no,
I still keep getting sucked back in.

228
00:20:12,449 --> 00:20:14,116
[inmates chattering]

229
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:35,282
It's my table.

230
00:20:36,907 --> 00:20:37,949
[inmates chuckle]

231
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:39,573
Really?

232
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:42,241
Aren't they all the same?

233
00:20:58,949 --> 00:20:59,990
[groans]

234
00:21:05,116 --> 00:21:07,532
Honestly, that really hurt.

235
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:10,324
[speaking in Spanish]

236
00:21:20,116 --> 00:21:21,197
[groans]

237
00:21:21,199 --> 00:21:23,532
[inmates cheering, yelling]

238
00:21:37,824 --> 00:21:39,573
[alarm buzzing]

239
00:22:25,157 --> 00:22:26,573
My love,

240
00:22:27,907 --> 00:22:29,990
you've done a great job as always.

241
00:22:30,657 --> 00:22:32,074
This party's going to be a success.

242
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:34,282
I know how important it is for you.

243
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:42,074
Is there something else?

244
00:22:42,865 --> 00:22:44,074
Something is wrong.

245
00:22:48,032 --> 00:22:50,282
No, everything is okay.

246
00:22:52,782 --> 00:22:54,407
This is a big deal.

247
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:56,782
That's all.

248
00:23:00,824 --> 00:23:02,282
Things are changing.

249
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,282
I need this.

250
00:23:09,116 --> 00:23:11,157
You know all matters is this family.

251
00:23:12,448 --> 00:23:14,615
- None of this matters.
- I know.

252
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,949
I know that.

253
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:22,698
Okay.

254
00:23:34,907 --> 00:23:36,573
- Sir.
- Yes.

255
00:23:37,532 --> 00:23:39,573
We are increasing security
for the party tonight.

256
00:23:41,323 --> 00:23:43,613
- Is there a problem?
- Nothing so far, sir.

257
00:23:43,615 --> 00:23:44,990
We're just being more cautious.

258
00:23:49,782 --> 00:23:54,365
I know you like to meet everybody
that works for you. This is Hector.

259
00:23:54,824 --> 00:23:56,782
I appreciate the opportunity, sir.

260
00:24:02,615 --> 00:24:04,698
- American?
- Yes, sir.

261
00:24:07,949 --> 00:24:10,782
- It's okay.
- [guard] Let's go.

262
00:24:42,116 --> 00:24:45,907
[in Spanish] I'm here
to see the American patient.

263
00:24:48,407 --> 00:24:50,114
I'll have to frisk you.

264
00:24:50,116 --> 00:24:51,824
They've never asked me before.

265
00:24:54,281 --> 00:24:56,074
[speaking in Spanish]

266
00:24:59,824 --> 00:25:01,365
- That wasn't so bad, was it?
- [speaking in Spanish]

267
00:25:04,281 --> 00:25:06,780
[in Spanish] Wait. You can't take that.

268
00:25:06,782 --> 00:25:08,863
They're my work instruments.

269
00:25:08,865 --> 00:25:11,072
Nope, it's the new policy.

270
00:25:11,074 --> 00:25:11,907
[sighs]

271
00:25:17,365 --> 00:25:20,030
Hi. We are the electricians.

272
00:25:20,032 --> 00:25:22,321
- Where is your equipment?
- Right here in the truck.

273
00:25:22,323 --> 00:25:23,532
Wait at the door.

274
00:25:50,824 --> 00:25:52,530
- [gasps]
- Are you okay, Doctor?

275
00:25:52,532 --> 00:25:54,615
[speaking in Spanish]

276
00:26:01,116 --> 00:26:03,532
- A nail.
- Gracias.

277
00:26:24,573 --> 00:26:26,865
[in Spanish] Is this the place
you need to be?

278
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:32,613
Hey! Is this the right place?

279
00:26:32,615 --> 00:26:38,156
Um, excuse him. He doesn't speak Spanish.
He's a refugee. You know how they are.

280
00:26:43,365 --> 00:26:45,072
We have to help them, right?

281
00:26:45,074 --> 00:26:46,615
He's a big one.

282
00:26:52,573 --> 00:26:54,198
What are these tanks for?

283
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,738
To clean the air ducts. Don't worry.

284
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:01,198
We'll have the system back up in no time.

285
00:27:07,615 --> 00:27:09,949
Okay. [speaking in Spanish]

286
00:27:24,573 --> 00:27:25,657
[Billy] Okay, we're in.

287
00:27:36,782 --> 00:27:40,407
[in Spanish] This is no way
to treat an injured patient. Please go.

288
00:27:41,407 --> 00:27:42,698
Go. Please. Now.

289
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,657
Hey, hey Norma,
what the hell are you doing here?

290
00:27:55,323 --> 00:27:56,323
Saving your life.

291
00:27:57,532 --> 00:27:59,279
Next time you try to keep me in the dark...

292
00:27:59,281 --> 00:28:01,657
Look, I told Price not
to get you involved.

293
00:28:01,865 --> 00:28:03,613
Well, you can't get rid of me that easy.

294
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:05,822
We're partners, or did you forget that?

295
00:28:05,824 --> 00:28:07,532
No, of course not.

296
00:28:07,949 --> 00:28:09,115
[exhales]

297
00:28:10,323 --> 00:28:11,573
Fuck.

298
00:28:12,865 --> 00:28:15,281
- Ouch.
- I'm sorry.

299
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,238
Look, I didn't want you
to get hurt, that's...

300
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,907
That's why I couldn't say anything.

301
00:28:23,323 --> 00:28:25,905
Well, I'm here now.

302
00:28:25,907 --> 00:28:27,240
Yeah, I can see that.

303
00:28:27,865 --> 00:28:30,657
- Where's Billy?
- On his way.

304
00:28:31,156 --> 00:28:32,115
Okay.

305
00:28:34,907 --> 00:28:37,824
- Is the foot locker in the armory?
- It's there.

306
00:28:39,156 --> 00:28:42,115
All right. Let's do this.

307
00:28:47,407 --> 00:28:49,448
Billy, I'm in, 20 seconds for the gas.

308
00:28:49,699 --> 00:28:50,949
We're in place.

309
00:28:53,156 --> 00:28:55,532
Wait, the gas. Don't you need...

310
00:28:57,115 --> 00:28:58,115
Masks.

311
00:29:01,115 --> 00:29:02,073
Nice job.

312
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:07,073
That little stunt back at the restaurant,
you can't keep pulling shit like that.

313
00:29:07,657 --> 00:29:10,488
I'm sorry, I had to get myself thrown
into this place to...

314
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:11,780
to pull this off, you know.

315
00:29:11,782 --> 00:29:15,699
Well, how about some stability?
Next time you won't be right.

316
00:29:16,824 --> 00:29:18,573
Probably in a place like this.

317
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,238
Excuse me.

318
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,407
[Norma sighing]

319
00:29:22,323 --> 00:29:24,115
We're not getting any younger.

320
00:29:24,323 --> 00:29:26,657
I think it's time for you to take things
to the next level.

321
00:29:26,948 --> 00:29:29,699
Can we talk about this
after we steal 20 million dollars?

322
00:29:32,448 --> 00:29:34,407
Twenty million, that's all?

323
00:29:34,989 --> 00:29:39,029
Yeah, but we're stealing it
from the most notorious drug lord

324
00:29:39,031 --> 00:29:39,865
on the planet.

325
00:29:40,657 --> 00:29:43,156
You... always something.

326
00:29:52,365 --> 00:29:53,532
Good night, folks.

327
00:29:54,407 --> 00:29:55,865
[gas hissing]

328
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,699
The gas is not working.

329
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:35,740
Give it 30 seconds. I'll get Billy.

330
00:30:43,532 --> 00:30:45,573
Fullington cameras are dark.

331
00:30:52,073 --> 00:30:55,031
[cop speaking in Spanish]

332
00:31:04,573 --> 00:31:05,864
Go get him, Tank.

333
00:31:11,906 --> 00:31:13,782
Lock the gate. Lock the gate.

334
00:31:19,532 --> 00:31:20,823
Lock the prison down!

335
00:31:22,198 --> 00:31:23,864
[siren wailing]

336
00:32:02,073 --> 00:32:03,906
[speaking in Spanish]

337
00:32:07,448 --> 00:32:08,864
[speaking in Spanish]

338
00:32:13,281 --> 00:32:14,281
[groans]

339
00:32:25,198 --> 00:32:26,615
- Ah.
- Okay.

340
00:32:26,864 --> 00:32:28,448
[siren continues wailing]

341
00:32:32,948 --> 00:32:34,699
[grunting]

342
00:32:39,781 --> 00:32:41,115
[siren stops]

343
00:33:01,323 --> 00:33:02,615
Tank, that's enough.

344
00:33:03,115 --> 00:33:04,657
Tank, that's enough, man.

345
00:33:05,073 --> 00:33:06,156
[over loud speaker] <i>Get him inside.</i>

346
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:24,864
Mask off, guys. Gas is gone,
we control the entire prison.

347
00:33:25,073 --> 00:33:26,530
One of the guards hit the panic button.

348
00:33:26,532 --> 00:33:30,156
Aw, shit. I'm gonna have
to cut through that.

349
00:33:31,532 --> 00:33:34,238
So only thing that's stopping us
from 20 million dollars is one door?

350
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,490
One giant door.
Four inches of steal at least.

351
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:38,696
Well, why don't we wake up
one of the guards,

352
00:33:38,698 --> 00:33:40,946
- get them to give us the combo?
- That's not going to work.

353
00:33:40,948 --> 00:33:43,490
Once that button's pushed
that shit's in lockdown.

354
00:33:44,031 --> 00:33:45,115
[Norma] How long?

355
00:33:45,698 --> 00:33:47,115
Twelve, twenty four hours.

356
00:33:48,615 --> 00:33:50,281
It all depends on how they set it up.

357
00:33:51,073 --> 00:33:53,198
All right, Tank, go make sure
the guards are tied up.

358
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,240
You got it.

359
00:33:56,115 --> 00:33:59,365
[exhales] It's going to take me like,
two or three hours to cut through it.

360
00:33:59,823 --> 00:34:02,823
That's okay,
guards shift change is at 6:00 AM.

361
00:34:03,989 --> 00:34:08,031
Hey Norma, try these on. Change of plans,
I'm going to be here for a while.

362
00:34:08,365 --> 00:34:09,989
- Get to it, Billy.
- Yes, sir.

363
00:34:12,115 --> 00:34:13,281
You got that phone?

364
00:34:23,448 --> 00:34:26,279
Price, why the hell did you send
Norma and Billy?

365
00:34:26,281 --> 00:34:29,864
Hell, you try stopping her,
she's ex-FARC, guerrilla warfare.

366
00:34:30,323 --> 00:34:31,906
Don't remind me of Venezuela.

367
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,613
Yeah, Jack, you turned
that into a real shit show.

368
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:36,446
That better not be happening now.

369
00:34:36,448 --> 00:34:38,862
Yeah, well,
there was a slight complication.

370
00:34:38,864 --> 00:34:41,532
Jack, I told you no screw ups.

371
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,614
You gave me three days.
I'll be out of here in two.

372
00:34:45,448 --> 00:34:48,407
All right, what are the complications?

373
00:34:48,698 --> 00:34:51,906
We have to cut through the armory door,
should take no more than a couple hours.

374
00:34:52,532 --> 00:34:55,321
Well, if the Capitan finds out
that you're in there,

375
00:34:55,323 --> 00:34:57,530
<i>we're all in deep shit.
You do understand that?</i>

376
00:34:57,532 --> 00:34:59,156
[Jack]
Wanna get Hector sitting on his house?

377
00:35:00,823 --> 00:35:02,240
Capitan gets a call I'll get a call.

378
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:05,948
Whoa, what Hector?
That little thief. Jesus Christ, Jack.

379
00:35:06,156 --> 00:35:10,198
Look... You guys are on your own in there.
I can't help you.

380
00:35:10,989 --> 00:35:13,614
What else is new? Thanks for the reminder.

381
00:35:26,281 --> 00:35:28,031
Sorry, I had to take that.

382
00:35:28,864 --> 00:35:30,281
[man] No problem.

383
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,614
Me and my drink are fine.

384
00:35:36,156 --> 00:35:39,240
So, I hear the Capitan is in town.

385
00:35:39,906 --> 00:35:41,073
That's right.

386
00:35:44,864 --> 00:35:48,448
He's throwing a big party
for his associates from Bogotá.

387
00:35:50,031 --> 00:35:51,739
Now there's a big deal going down.

388
00:35:55,115 --> 00:35:56,823
Now you didn't hear that from me.

389
00:35:59,281 --> 00:36:00,323
Hear what?

390
00:36:22,698 --> 00:36:24,572
Nice doing business with you, mate.

391
00:36:33,198 --> 00:36:34,323
[Norma] <i>Tank, come in.</i>

392
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:41,698
Come in.

393
00:36:46,656 --> 00:36:48,073
Check the monitors.

394
00:36:50,489 --> 00:36:51,823
Tank, come in.

395
00:37:01,739 --> 00:37:02,781
Come in, Tank.

396
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:08,489
- Tank?
- Are you going alone?

397
00:37:11,614 --> 00:37:12,656
Apparently.

398
00:37:14,323 --> 00:37:15,531
[Jack] Keep trying him.

399
00:37:17,739 --> 00:37:18,614
Tank, come in.

400
00:37:27,281 --> 00:37:29,031
Tank, come in.

401
00:37:30,365 --> 00:37:31,614
Tank, come in.

402
00:37:32,614 --> 00:37:34,781
Copy. What's up?

403
00:37:35,156 --> 00:37:36,821
Where have you been?

404
00:37:36,823 --> 00:37:38,240
I had to change.

405
00:37:38,531 --> 00:37:41,572
Meet Jack by the K10 entrance
for a delivery ASAP.

406
00:37:45,489 --> 00:37:46,698
On my way.

407
00:37:51,698 --> 00:37:54,821
Hey, who's idea was it to not bring guns?

408
00:37:54,823 --> 00:37:59,113
Mine. Nobody dies here.
And next time answer your radio.

409
00:37:59,115 --> 00:38:00,698
Sure thing, boss.

410
00:38:01,365 --> 00:38:02,864
Norma, open the door.

411
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,323
[typing vigorously]

412
00:38:06,489 --> 00:38:07,906
[door opens]

413
00:38:16,948 --> 00:38:18,198
Just in case.

414
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,737
By the way, who's money
are we stealing anyway?

415
00:38:22,739 --> 00:38:24,572
Billy wouldn't say.

416
00:38:25,073 --> 00:38:26,570
He doesn't know.

417
00:38:26,572 --> 00:38:29,198
The only guy around here with that kind
of cash is Capitan.

418
00:38:30,156 --> 00:38:32,614
- Why'd you ask?
- Trust.

419
00:38:32,864 --> 00:38:35,031
I want to see what kind
of man I'm working with.

420
00:38:37,698 --> 00:38:39,489
Did I pass your little test?

421
00:38:40,115 --> 00:38:41,281
For now.

422
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:48,989
The money stays where it is,
until I get what we agreed upon,

423
00:38:50,031 --> 00:38:51,363
and I need it quickly.

424
00:38:51,365 --> 00:38:53,404
[man over phone] <i>Don't worry,
I'm working on it.</i>

425
00:38:53,406 --> 00:38:54,531
You better.

426
00:38:56,447 --> 00:38:57,739
There's a lot at stake.

427
00:39:05,698 --> 00:39:07,323
[in Spanish] <i>So, let me get this straight.</i>

428
00:39:08,906 --> 00:39:12,323
[in Spanish]
A giant white guy came

429
00:39:13,073 --> 00:39:15,279
and robbed my accountant,

430
00:39:15,281 --> 00:39:19,948
while he was banging
a waitress in the bathroom.

431
00:39:21,156 --> 00:39:22,489
Yes, sir.

432
00:39:23,948 --> 00:39:25,781
And where were you
while this was happening?

433
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:32,404
Well, he wanted privacy
and there was a soccer game on, and...

434
00:39:32,406 --> 00:39:34,447
Oh, please! A soccer game?

435
00:39:35,447 --> 00:39:36,531
What else?

436
00:39:38,572 --> 00:39:39,781
They stole money, I guess.

437
00:39:41,322 --> 00:39:47,529
You're trying to tell me that a guy
that has worked for me for ten years

438
00:39:47,531 --> 00:39:49,946
would just disappear
from the face of the Earth

439
00:39:49,948 --> 00:39:52,322
that the Police Chief can't even find him.

440
00:39:52,864 --> 00:39:55,989
And he would do all that because he lost
some cash and credit cards?

441
00:39:56,656 --> 00:39:57,739
Please!

442
00:39:59,906 --> 00:40:01,073
What else was stolen?

443
00:40:02,031 --> 00:40:03,073
A disk.

444
00:40:06,447 --> 00:40:07,698
What kind of disk?

445
00:40:09,656 --> 00:40:10,989
A small disk drive.

446
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:20,737
A disk he wore around his neck?

447
00:40:20,739 --> 00:40:22,823
[exhales] Yes, sir.

448
00:40:30,115 --> 00:40:31,198
[bangs desk]

449
00:40:32,156 --> 00:40:34,322
Get the hell out of here! Get out now!

450
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:52,240
I want you to bring me
that fucking gringo.

451
00:40:53,073 --> 00:40:55,031
I want you to bring me that disk.

452
00:40:55,656 --> 00:40:58,406
We searched him, he did not have a disk.

453
00:41:00,115 --> 00:41:03,447
And, um, he was transferred.

454
00:41:05,489 --> 00:41:07,322
What do you mean, transferred?

455
00:41:09,489 --> 00:41:12,489
[speaking in Spanish] The big prison.

456
00:41:21,531 --> 00:41:22,946
We're being robbed.

457
00:41:22,948 --> 00:41:24,447
[grim music playing]

458
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:36,614
[machine whirring]

459
00:41:45,364 --> 00:41:46,739
Where did you find Tank?

460
00:41:47,698 --> 00:41:50,614
He's ex-special forces.
A couple of friends knew him.

461
00:41:51,572 --> 00:41:53,154
What did you see about him before?

462
00:41:53,156 --> 00:41:56,073
He beat the living shit out of this guard
in the parking lot.

463
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:00,864
- They'll kill you.
- I can take them, come on.

464
00:42:01,364 --> 00:42:02,656
Of course, you could.

465
00:42:26,447 --> 00:42:28,823
[music continues playing]

466
00:43:13,364 --> 00:43:15,487
- [Capitan] Hector.
- Yes, sir.

467
00:43:15,489 --> 00:43:17,155
- It's Hector, right?
- Yes, sir.

468
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:20,614
- How is everything out here?
- Good, all secure.

469
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,280
- Everything fine?
- Yes, sir, secure.

470
00:43:25,073 --> 00:43:28,322
You know, Hector, I like to make sure that

471
00:43:28,948 --> 00:43:32,155
I get to know well
everyone that works for me,

472
00:43:33,447 --> 00:43:34,572
and you are new.

473
00:43:36,073 --> 00:43:37,864
So, I thought we could have a little chat.

474
00:43:39,864 --> 00:43:40,781
Okay.

475
00:43:41,656 --> 00:43:42,698
Sit.

476
00:43:49,989 --> 00:43:52,322
You know, I've hired <i>gringos</i> before.

477
00:43:53,489 --> 00:43:57,698
Ex-military, crooked cops, guys like that.

478
00:43:59,155 --> 00:44:03,072
There's something about them.
They are loyal.

479
00:44:05,364 --> 00:44:08,698
They don't think too much
about themselves, they seem focused.

480
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,656
You seem focused.

481
00:44:15,114 --> 00:44:18,155
- I kind of like you, Hector.
- Thank you, sir.

482
00:44:22,531 --> 00:44:23,698
Military or cop?

483
00:44:25,447 --> 00:44:27,445
Navy. I was a kid.

484
00:44:27,447 --> 00:44:29,739
Really? Me too.

485
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,197
- Mexican Marina, Marines.
- Nice.

486
00:44:33,656 --> 00:44:35,072
Why do you think they call me Capitan.

487
00:44:36,364 --> 00:44:37,447
What about you?

488
00:44:38,572 --> 00:44:39,656
Sir?

489
00:44:42,406 --> 00:44:43,906
What rank were you?

490
00:44:45,406 --> 00:44:47,570
I was just a sailor.
I didn't really... it was a long time ago...

491
00:44:47,572 --> 00:44:48,489
Lieutenant.

492
00:44:49,823 --> 00:44:52,155
- Sir.
- First lieutenant, to be accurate.

493
00:44:55,155 --> 00:44:57,989
First lieutenant, special warfare command.

494
00:44:59,114 --> 00:45:00,614
Navy Seal.

495
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:05,364
Seal Team Two, to be exact.

496
00:45:14,322 --> 00:45:16,447
Maybe you don't remember, you were a kid.

497
00:45:17,447 --> 00:45:18,572
Anyway...

498
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:21,239
Iraq,

499
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,364
Afghanistan,

500
00:45:25,239 --> 00:45:26,239
Columbia.

501
00:45:27,572 --> 00:45:28,614
Remember there?

502
00:45:30,364 --> 00:45:31,781
I was in Columbia.

503
00:45:33,447 --> 00:45:35,948
[speaking in Spanish] The jungles.

504
00:45:38,114 --> 00:45:39,906
It was a crazy place then.

505
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:42,197
Wasn't it?

506
00:45:45,406 --> 00:45:47,114
You know who else was there,

507
00:45:47,572 --> 00:45:50,322
running around like a bunch of assholes?

508
00:45:52,364 --> 00:45:53,572
DEA.

509
00:45:56,406 --> 00:45:59,823
When they weren't giving me
and my associates a hard time,

510
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:03,947
they were always recruiting.

511
00:46:05,864 --> 00:46:08,155
They loved special forces.

512
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:12,614
Delta, Rangers, Navy Seals.

513
00:46:17,239 --> 00:46:20,572
They must have tried to get you
to join them at some point.

514
00:46:21,322 --> 00:46:22,239
Didn't they?

515
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:24,489
That's a long time ago.

516
00:46:26,906 --> 00:46:27,906
Yeah,

517
00:46:29,656 --> 00:46:30,823
long time ago.

518
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:43,322
You realize that there is, uh,

519
00:46:45,364 --> 00:46:49,114
a dignity in what is going to happen
to you now, right?

520
00:46:51,322 --> 00:46:53,489
That's why you have to accept it.

521
00:46:54,781 --> 00:46:56,114
No begging,

522
00:46:57,823 --> 00:46:59,155
no pleading.

523
00:47:01,489 --> 00:47:04,988
Hector, there is no mercy.

524
00:47:06,155 --> 00:47:10,821
Not for you, not for your friends
inside my jail,

525
00:47:10,823 --> 00:47:12,364
trying to steal my money.

526
00:47:19,072 --> 00:47:21,861
No mercy, no way out.

527
00:47:21,863 --> 00:47:24,656
- Capitan, may be...
- Hector... [shushing]

528
00:47:26,781 --> 00:47:27,739
Dignity,

529
00:47:29,447 --> 00:47:30,947
acceptance.

530
00:48:02,489 --> 00:48:03,988
[line ringing]

531
00:48:07,656 --> 00:48:08,822
[phone ringing]

532
00:48:10,863 --> 00:48:11,988
Don't pick it up.

533
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:15,531
What if it's for one of the guards?

534
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,614
[phone continues ringing]

535
00:48:18,322 --> 00:48:19,364
Okay.

536
00:48:22,863 --> 00:48:24,072
<i>Hola, buenos dias.</i>

537
00:48:26,863 --> 00:48:27,947
Who are you?

538
00:48:32,072 --> 00:48:33,239
<i>So it's you.</i>

539
00:48:35,947 --> 00:48:37,322
I know you're in there.

540
00:48:38,489 --> 00:48:39,697
Hector's dead,

541
00:48:41,447 --> 00:48:44,364
and if you take my money,
you're dead, too.

542
00:48:46,656 --> 00:48:47,988
All of you.

543
00:48:50,364 --> 00:48:51,780
Do you hear me?

544
00:48:54,322 --> 00:48:55,447
Dead.

545
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:07,364
How bad is it?

546
00:49:08,364 --> 00:49:09,863
They know we're here.

547
00:49:14,489 --> 00:49:16,072
[machine whirring]

548
00:49:28,822 --> 00:49:29,905
Hector's gone.

549
00:49:31,406 --> 00:49:33,697
Shit man, poor bastard.

550
00:49:34,863 --> 00:49:36,736
What are you going to do?

551
00:49:36,738 --> 00:49:38,364
Find out who's coming for us.

552
00:49:39,531 --> 00:49:40,531
Back to work.

553
00:50:05,614 --> 00:50:07,572
Hey, gringo.

554
00:50:12,738 --> 00:50:14,114
You got a mean left hook.

555
00:50:15,406 --> 00:50:16,572
You, too.

556
00:50:18,656 --> 00:50:20,572
I guess you're in over your head, huh?

557
00:50:21,822 --> 00:50:23,072
Why would you say that?

558
00:50:25,656 --> 00:50:29,030
Everyone knows about the armor, the money.

559
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:36,114
It's just that no one ever thought
of robbing it before.

560
00:50:38,364 --> 00:50:39,447
You know why?

561
00:50:41,322 --> 00:50:44,155
Because no one steals from the Capitan
and lives to tell.

562
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:49,696
Mexican Marinas.

563
00:50:57,905 --> 00:50:59,280
US Marine Corp.

564
00:51:01,030 --> 00:51:02,114
Semper Fi.

565
00:51:03,738 --> 00:51:05,197
He was a sniper.

566
00:51:13,738 --> 00:51:15,447
Ah, sometimes I wish I was back.

567
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:19,030
It was easier then.

568
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:21,863
The Cartel?

569
00:51:26,738 --> 00:51:28,197
Did you work for Capitan?

570
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,280
Five years.

571
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:32,696
How else you think I wind up in here?

572
00:51:33,822 --> 00:51:35,905
We had one of those difference of opinion.

573
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:39,822
I need some help,

574
00:51:41,863 --> 00:51:42,947
information.

575
00:51:45,822 --> 00:51:47,364
I'll give you the keys when we leave.

576
00:51:48,197 --> 00:51:49,364
What do you want to know?

577
00:51:50,364 --> 00:51:51,780
Who's he sending next?

578
00:51:58,072 --> 00:51:59,489
They're called the operators.

579
00:52:00,322 --> 00:52:02,780
Military trained true killers.

580
00:52:03,655 --> 00:52:07,197
Once they get a contract,
you die, or they die trying.

581
00:52:09,155 --> 00:52:10,239
Terrific.

582
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:12,571
Bet you they're already on their way.

583
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,447
And that, my friend,
is not going to stop them.

584
00:52:24,571 --> 00:52:25,863
Thanks.

585
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:38,406
Hey Billy, how much longer?

586
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:39,905
Forty-five minutes, tops.

587
00:52:41,364 --> 00:52:43,114
We're going to get company, be careful.

588
00:52:43,696 --> 00:52:44,822
Should we just blow it?

589
00:52:46,655 --> 00:52:50,406
- Too risky. Fireball could burn the money.
- Got it.

590
00:52:52,571 --> 00:52:55,155
- You seen Tank?
- [Norma] I thought he was with you.

591
00:52:57,822 --> 00:53:00,320
- Maybe he's got his own agenda.
- Who?

592
00:53:00,322 --> 00:53:02,489
Tank, the big guy. I don't trust him.

593
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:06,322
Something isn't right.

594
00:53:12,655 --> 00:53:15,694
You know, maybe we should just forget
about the money.

595
00:53:15,696 --> 00:53:17,028
[sighs]

596
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:20,571
Walk out of here, get a small apartment,

597
00:53:21,905 --> 00:53:24,447
- open a cafe.
- Jack.

598
00:53:25,822 --> 00:53:27,736
What, I thought you wanted the cafe?

599
00:53:27,738 --> 00:53:30,362
I do, but let's not stop now.

600
00:53:30,364 --> 00:53:31,863
We can do this.

601
00:53:34,322 --> 00:53:37,406
[sighs] All right, it's your call.

602
00:53:40,613 --> 00:53:43,237
Hey, that's him.

603
00:53:43,239 --> 00:53:45,863
- Where is that?
- The guards locker room.

604
00:53:48,655 --> 00:53:50,072
He already cleared that area.

605
00:53:52,571 --> 00:53:55,863
Hey, thanks.

606
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:03,488
Jack...

607
00:54:06,322 --> 00:54:08,863
After this we're done. Deal?

608
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:11,613
Deal.

609
00:54:20,696 --> 00:54:22,406

[speaking in Spanish]

612
00:54:54,613 --> 00:54:56,988
- Is everything okay?
- Yes, everything's okay.

613
00:54:57,364 --> 00:55:01,197
- Look at me, something is wrong.
- Everything is okay.

614
00:55:01,905 --> 00:55:03,488
I'm working things, okay?

615
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:08,488
What time is it?

616
00:55:10,738 --> 00:55:12,738
In an hour everything's ready.

617
00:55:16,988 --> 00:55:18,072
I'm sorry.

618
00:55:21,863 --> 00:55:23,197
Thanks for everything.

619
00:55:37,363 --> 00:55:38,655
Tank?

620
00:55:39,239 --> 00:55:40,239
Yeah.

621
00:55:43,822 --> 00:55:44,822
What the hell.

622
00:55:45,738 --> 00:55:48,988
Well, they got lose so I had to do
what I had to do.

623
00:55:57,155 --> 00:55:59,528
- I said no one dies here.
- I had no choice.

624
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:02,528
- How do you figure?
- This ain't no damn robbery, is it?

625
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:03,988
Who do you work for?

626
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:05,988
Nobody.

627
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:08,405
Bullshit, tell me.

628
00:56:11,696 --> 00:56:14,736
- Are you gonna kill me too now?
- Don't push me.

629
00:56:14,738 --> 00:56:16,114
Jack?

630
00:56:17,446 --> 00:56:18,780
Movement outside.

631
00:56:19,905 --> 00:56:21,571
Can you tell me how many?

632
00:56:23,446 --> 00:56:24,446
Norma?

633
00:56:29,363 --> 00:56:30,905
Jack? Jack!

634
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:33,571
We're being breached.

635
00:56:34,488 --> 00:56:36,030
- [Jack] <i>Where?</i>
- North end.

636
00:56:36,655 --> 00:56:38,239
<i>Yeah, all right then.</i>

637
00:56:39,822 --> 00:56:40,655
Norma.

638
00:56:44,321 --> 00:56:47,030
Okay, we have to stop those guys
before they get to the armory.

639
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:50,446
- Truce?
- For now.

640
00:56:52,405 --> 00:56:53,863
All right, let's go.

641
00:56:59,072 --> 00:57:00,279

Norma, you all right?

643
00:57:17,905 --> 00:57:18,947
Good.

644
00:57:35,738 --> 00:57:38,863
- Norma, open all the cells in C block now.
- Copy that.

645
00:57:39,613 --> 00:57:40,697
Do it now!

00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:14,530
Can't talk right now.

649
00:58:19,363 --> 00:58:20,863

for this job?

Oh, my God, Billy.

- Shut up.

Piece of shit, man.

680
01:04:50,862 --> 01:04:52,904
He's been looking for the exit
ever since he got here.

681

What do we do now?

682
01:05:19,821 --> 01:05:21,779

- Where's the money?

01:08:16,488 --> 01:08:17,612
Pick them up.

711
01:08:18,530 --> 01:08:19,571
Let's go.

712
01:08:23,821 --> 01:08:25,363
So who's your phone buddy?

713
01:08:32,029 --> 01:08:34,571
I'm guessing the guy
who's getting the drugs across the border

714
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:37,446
to your old hood.

715
01:08:44,154 --> 01:08:47,279
Nice job, genius. Hope it was worth it.

716
01:08:48,612 --> 01:08:50,530
I never said I was a good guy.

717
01:08:57,737 --> 01:09:00,862
Oh, yeah, the guard in the parking lot.

718
01:09:02,570 --> 01:09:03,946
He moved the money for you, right?

719
01:09:05,113 --> 01:09:06,696
Finally put it together, huh?

720
01:09:06,987 --> 01:09:08,570
[grunting]

721
01:09:13,238 --> 01:09:14,904
I'm gonna enjoy this.

722
01:09:28,612 --> 01:09:30,196
Where'd you learn to fight, Peace Corp?

723
01:09:30,446 --> 01:09:31,654
[both grunting]

724
01:09:39,196 --> 01:09:40,570
Who was on the phone?

725
01:09:45,529 --> 01:09:46,570
Last chance.

726
01:09:49,154 --> 01:09:50,196
[grunting]

727
01:10:08,279 --> 01:10:09,570
I'll go with.

728
01:10:21,363 --> 01:10:22,405
Bye, Tank.

729
01:10:57,445 --> 01:11:00,612
Well, I think this is the part when I say
I'm getting too old for this shit.

730
01:11:01,987 --> 01:11:03,405
You okay, man?

731
01:11:04,029 --> 01:11:05,363
Yeah, yeah.

732
01:11:05,654 --> 01:11:07,612
I fired Tank. I found these.

733
01:11:12,196 --> 01:11:13,985
[speaking in Spanish]

734
01:11:13,987 --> 01:11:16,277
Un-freaking-believable.
So much money, man.

735
01:11:16,279 --> 01:11:19,612
Forget the cafe,
we're opening a hotel, five stars.

736
01:11:20,737 --> 01:11:21,987
Something like that.

737
01:11:24,487 --> 01:11:27,113
I hate to be the person to break up
this tender moment,

738
01:11:27,612 --> 01:11:29,904
but it's about time we leave.
We got to go make a deposit.

739
01:11:32,279 --> 01:11:33,487
What the hell?

740
01:11:34,654 --> 01:11:37,071
Man, I knew it. We're too late.

741
01:11:38,529 --> 01:11:40,196
The van is ready let's go.

742
01:11:41,154 --> 01:11:42,404
Wait.

743
01:11:42,821 --> 01:11:45,779
They didn't cut the power
from here, from the outside.

744
01:11:46,570 --> 01:11:47,779
Perfect, man.

745
01:11:49,238 --> 01:11:50,779
What are we supposed to do now?

746
01:11:55,529 --> 01:11:58,071
- Get some help.
- Oh, great idea.

747
01:11:59,779 --> 01:12:00,904
Any idea who?

748
01:12:02,363 --> 01:12:03,654
I know a guy.

749
01:12:06,654 --> 01:12:08,445
[inmates chattering]

750
01:12:10,113 --> 01:12:11,529
What if I asked you to help?

751
01:12:11,987 --> 01:12:13,404
Why would any of us help you?

752
01:12:14,612 --> 01:12:16,445
I'll give you five million reasons.

753
01:12:28,904 --> 01:12:30,238
So what's he sending next?

754
01:12:30,946 --> 01:12:34,445
They call it the bus. It's one
of those buses that we all have here.

755
01:12:35,029 --> 01:12:36,321
What's in the bus?

756
01:12:37,154 --> 01:12:39,696
Death. Death itself.

757
01:12:41,279 --> 01:12:44,404
International assassins
always dressed in black.

758
01:12:45,279 --> 01:12:48,529
When the operators fail, they don't.

759
01:12:51,737 --> 01:12:55,154
Hey, Norma, open all of three block.

760
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:58,154
Double cross me and I'll kill you.

761
01:12:59,196 --> 01:13:01,610
- That's fine.
- Let's go.

762
01:13:01,612 --> 01:13:04,320
- [inmate speaking in Spanish]
- [inmates cheering]

763
01:13:18,445 --> 01:13:20,862
[speaking in Spanish]

764
01:13:21,445 --> 01:13:23,279
You got a plan, my friend?

765
01:13:24,487 --> 01:13:26,279
[speaking in Spanish]

766
01:13:50,071 --> 01:13:51,445
Come on, Jack, let's go.

767
01:13:57,029 --> 01:13:58,612
[engine starts]

768
01:14:21,487 --> 01:14:23,113
- [inmate] Fire!
- [gunfire]

769
01:14:43,445 --> 01:14:45,154
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

770
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:47,362
Remember me?

771
01:14:57,237 --> 01:14:59,944
[Jack over phone] <i>Hey, Norma, you make it</i>
<i>to the meeting point yet?</i>

772
01:14:59,946 --> 01:15:01,404
No, she's with me, Jack.

773
01:15:01,946 --> 01:15:03,360
<i>Who is this?</i>

774
01:15:03,362 --> 01:15:05,320
This is the man who got the drop on you.

775
01:15:05,946 --> 01:15:11,779
Now, you have my money and, well,
if you want to see your girlfriend again,

776
01:15:13,404 --> 01:15:15,612
I'll suggest you give it back to me, Jack.

777
01:15:17,445 --> 01:15:18,654
<i>Just tell me where.</i>

778
01:15:19,029 --> 01:15:21,696
Good. I knew you'd see things
my way, eventually.

779
01:15:24,612 --> 01:15:26,362
Lover boy misses you, sweetheart.

780
01:16:06,237 --> 01:16:08,612
It's nice to know
you can still follow orders, Jack.

781
01:16:10,696 --> 01:16:12,570
How long you been working with the cartel?

782
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:17,652
No. You're looking at that
the wrong way, Jack.

783
01:16:17,654 --> 01:16:21,237
You see, they pay me for protection.

784
01:16:21,737 --> 01:16:24,445
I send them my snoopy
little agents like Price

785
01:16:24,737 --> 01:16:26,694
and well, I get the possible re-election.

786
01:16:26,696 --> 01:16:28,362
I get the money to build my wall.

787
01:16:28,737 --> 01:16:30,278
It's a win win, Jack.

788
01:16:30,987 --> 01:16:34,529
Except the drugs go under your wall
to the kids back home.

789
01:16:35,112 --> 01:16:38,904
Well, politics, details Jack.

790
01:16:40,237 --> 01:16:42,946
Now show me my money, please.

791
01:16:43,904 --> 01:16:45,112
Show me Norma.

792
01:17:02,362 --> 01:17:05,570
Well, I guess, I underestimated you, Jack.

793
01:17:06,029 --> 01:17:07,195
Billy.

794
01:17:17,821 --> 01:17:21,029
I guess I underestimated you, Jack.
Indeed I did, but maybe

795
01:17:21,862 --> 01:17:26,070
you and I can come to some mutual
beneficial arrangement ourselves.

796
01:17:26,696 --> 01:17:30,278
You and me Jack, another win win.
Would that be so bad?

797
01:17:34,821 --> 01:17:36,654
Honestly, yeah.

798
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:40,278
Okay, may I ask why?

799
01:17:42,570 --> 01:17:43,987
Because you killed my friend.

800
01:17:44,821 --> 01:17:46,696
Shot him down like a dog in the street.

801
01:17:47,612 --> 01:17:51,946
Now, Jack, don't go doing anything
you're going to regret.

802
01:17:52,362 --> 01:17:53,946
You're out gunned here, okay.

803
01:17:54,612 --> 01:17:56,153
Because you're above the law?

804
01:17:57,654 --> 01:18:00,445
[chuckles] Actually, Jack, I am the law.

805
01:18:01,070 --> 01:18:02,821
I am a US Senator

806
01:18:03,654 --> 01:18:04,904
and you

807
01:18:06,362 --> 01:18:09,360
are a thief that got booted from the DEA.

808
01:18:09,362 --> 01:18:10,445
Go on.

809
01:18:14,570 --> 01:18:16,028
Jack. [panting]

810
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:21,068
You were wrong about one thing, Senator.

811
01:18:21,070 --> 01:18:22,362
Oh, yeah, what's that, Jack?

812
01:18:24,946 --> 01:18:27,028
I was never kicked out of the DEA.

813
01:18:36,862 --> 01:18:40,237
It's in the van. You kill him.
Go! Kill him!

814
01:18:46,737 --> 01:18:47,821
Kill him!

815
01:18:48,445 --> 01:18:50,110
[speaking in Spanish] Get in the car.

816
01:18:50,112 --> 01:18:51,193
- Get in the car.
- What?

817
01:18:51,195 --> 01:18:52,946
- [engine starts]
- Where are you going?

818
01:18:53,445 --> 01:18:54,904
Hey, hey!

819
01:18:56,862 --> 01:18:58,070
Get back.

820
01:19:03,821 --> 01:19:04,862
Jack!

821
01:19:09,445 --> 01:19:10,986
Jack, Jack!

822
01:19:15,404 --> 01:19:16,570
Jack?

823
01:19:17,153 --> 01:19:18,404
Don't do this.

824
01:19:21,404 --> 01:19:24,570
Please. We could still make a deal.

825
01:19:26,445 --> 01:19:27,904
I'll take it from here.

826
01:19:30,737 --> 01:19:33,320
Jack, do not leave me here.

827
01:19:34,529 --> 01:19:36,404
God damn it, Jack, do not.

828
01:19:38,404 --> 01:19:40,362
- [engine starts]
- Jack!

829
01:19:41,612 --> 01:19:45,445
Guys, you're looking at
a US Senator, okay?

830
01:19:45,821 --> 01:19:48,612
[shouting] Conservative republican.
That's me.

831
01:19:49,696 --> 01:19:51,570
I am American, God damn it.

832
01:19:52,779 --> 01:19:54,737
There's a lot of money in that bag,
feel free to take it.

833
01:19:57,278 --> 01:19:58,612
You work for the Capitan.

834
01:20:00,821 --> 01:20:03,402
- Okay, what's going on?
- [in Spanish] Take him.

835
01:20:03,404 --> 01:20:07,237
No, no, no. Hey did you not hear
what I'm saying? Jack!

836
01:20:08,903 --> 01:20:10,779
Jack! Jack!

837
01:20:11,821 --> 01:20:13,568
[Capitan] You don't know
who you're dealing with.

838
01:20:13,570 --> 01:20:14,821
[Jack] <i>Oh, yes, I do.</i>

839
01:20:15,945 --> 01:20:19,860
<i>I'm dealing with the one who put me
and my guys away for five years</i>

840
01:20:19,862 --> 01:20:21,696
<i>while you sat in your mansion.</i>

841
01:20:22,362 --> 01:20:23,903
You've got to be kidding me.

842
01:20:24,737 --> 01:20:26,112
As a matter of fact,

843
01:20:26,862 --> 01:20:29,821
<i>some of them are about
to visit you right now.</i>

844
01:20:35,487 --> 01:20:37,070
<i>Make sure you say hello for me.</i>

845
01:20:38,612 --> 01:20:39,861
<i>And </i>adios,

846
01:20:40,487 --> 01:20:41,737
mi <i>Capitan.</i>

847
01:21:10,445 --> 01:21:11,654
[all cock guns]

848
01:21:28,654 --> 01:21:30,320
Dignity and acceptance.

849
01:21:33,737 --> 01:21:34,903
[gunshot]

850
01:22:00,903 --> 01:22:02,485
[Norma] Billy, stop the car.

851
01:22:02,487 --> 01:22:05,153
Stop the car, Billy. Let me out.

852
01:22:07,945 --> 01:22:09,153
Let me out.

853
01:22:11,070 --> 01:22:13,070
Move, move.

854
01:22:13,696 --> 01:22:15,070
This is bullshit!

855
01:22:15,487 --> 01:22:18,028
Just stay here man,
I'll handle this. Okay?

856
01:22:18,986 --> 01:22:20,153
Bullshit.

857
01:22:22,112 --> 01:22:25,195
Norma, Norma wait, wait. Norma, just stop.

858
01:22:25,654 --> 01:22:27,612
Come on, you know we had
to give the money back.

859
01:22:27,820 --> 01:22:29,818
We can't keep the money, just chill.

860
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:31,570
This next assignment will be our last one.

861
01:22:31,861 --> 01:22:33,778
He told me this was the last assignment.

862
01:22:35,445 --> 01:22:36,568
Well, you know how he is.

863
01:22:36,570 --> 01:22:38,778
I mean, I've told you to break up with him
like a thousand times.

864
01:22:39,487 --> 01:22:40,570
[sighs]

865
01:22:46,529 --> 01:22:47,654
Please?

866
01:22:53,153 --> 01:22:54,362
Please.

867
01:22:56,612 --> 01:22:57,654
Fine.

868
01:22:59,736 --> 01:23:02,235
