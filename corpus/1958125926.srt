1
00:02:13,581 --> 00:02:14,621
I told you a zillion times.

2
00:02:14,981 --> 00:02:16,061
Keep the strap tight.

3
00:02:16,461 --> 00:02:17,621
But you never listen.

4
00:02:18,165 --> 00:02:19,885
Teddy, you're not that old, don't nag.

5
00:02:21,936 --> 00:02:22,736
Web!

6
00:02:23,142 --> 00:02:24,342
Nothing must go wrong.

7
00:02:25,486 --> 00:02:26,606
I know.

8
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:34,714
Hey, UG Brothers!

9
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,300
Are you ready?

10
00:02:36,477 --> 00:02:38,197
Over 1 million viewers will be online.

11
00:02:38,262 --> 00:02:40,302
All systems go. Catch!

12
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:42,439
Right time, right place, right person.

13
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,496
Everything is perfect.

14
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:47,539
This is a livecast online,

15
00:02:47,565 --> 00:02:49,125
we'll be famous.

16
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:51,310
You bet! With our technology.

17
00:02:53,222 --> 00:02:54,022
Cool?

18
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,840
Too cool.

19
00:02:56,047 --> 00:02:57,407
You too.

20
00:02:57,569 --> 00:02:58,489
Stop horsing around.

21
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,600
Syndra, bring up 
the simulated preview.

22
00:03:01,246 --> 00:03:02,166
Let's go.

23
00:03:05,316 --> 00:03:06,196
Look!

24
00:03:13,907 --> 00:03:16,747
Web, open the parachute 
when you drop to 200m.

25
00:03:17,427 --> 00:03:18,747
The train is moving in high speed,

26
00:03:19,698 --> 00:03:21,858
I'll mark my time and land on it.

27
00:03:22,685 --> 00:03:24,325
You must be careful.

28
00:03:24,545 --> 00:03:25,905
I will.

29
00:03:27,143 --> 00:03:28,503
Enjoy the ride.

30
00:03:28,786 --> 00:03:30,266
Leave the rest to us.

31
00:03:31,026 --> 00:03:31,946
OK!

32
00:03:32,327 --> 00:03:33,167
No problem.

33
00:03:33,722 --> 00:03:34,642
Cut it out!

34
00:03:34,857 --> 00:03:35,737
Let's get to work.

35
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:44,890
I'll go.

36
00:03:45,263 --> 00:03:46,383
JJ, cut it out!

37
00:03:46,423 --> 00:03:47,663
What's that?

38
00:03:48,432 --> 00:03:49,432
The eye in the sky.

39
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,400
My masterpiece.

40
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,850
Be careful! 
The livecast depends on this baby.

41
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,370
No sweat!

42
00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:33,061
<i>How do you feel, buddy?</i>

43
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,360
<i>Super!</i>

44
00:04:35,223 --> 00:04:36,503
<i>Like Batman…</i>

45
00:04:36,615 --> 00:04:37,815
More like Superman.

46
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:41,328
Visual and audio looks good.

47
00:04:41,398 --> 00:04:42,518
But then…

48
00:04:42,609 --> 00:04:44,529
you'll run 
into rising warm air current.

49
00:04:58,581 --> 00:05:00,261
Teddy, the viewers online

50
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:01,861
have exceeded 1 million.

51
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,600
<i>We'll be a sensation!</i>

52
00:05:12,214 --> 00:05:13,254
JJ!

53
00:05:13,507 --> 00:05:15,080
Don't lose them.

54
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,720
This is the most valuable moment.

55
00:05:17,274 --> 00:05:18,394
Roger!

56
00:05:19,187 --> 00:05:20,507
Go, baby!

57
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:35,914
The current has changed, Teddy.

58
00:05:43,882 --> 00:05:45,042
<i>We have crosswind.</i>

59
00:05:45,186 --> 00:05:47,066
<i>Open the parachute! Hurry!</i>

60
00:06:07,585 --> 00:06:10,945
Give it up! 
The air current is too strong.

61
00:06:11,101 --> 00:06:13,781
Too late! He's too close to the train.

62
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:15,628
Teddy!

63
00:06:18,806 --> 00:06:19,806
Teddy!

64
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:21,989
You must land on the top of the train.

65
00:06:22,102 --> 00:06:22,982
Are you mad?

66
00:06:23,063 --> 00:06:24,543
He has no other choice.

67
00:06:24,707 --> 00:06:25,987
If he opens the parachute now

68
00:06:26,488 --> 00:06:28,128
everything goes down the drain.

69
00:06:33,442 --> 00:06:35,202
<i>I will land on the train.</i>

70
00:06:52,922 --> 00:06:54,162
Teddy!

71
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,000
Teddy!

72
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:09,118
Teddy!

73
00:07:12,342 --> 00:07:13,342
Syndra!

74
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,360
You gave me your word!

75
00:08:01,495 --> 00:08:02,335
You…

76
00:08:07,718 --> 00:08:08,558
Mom!

77
00:08:13,184 --> 00:08:14,184
Dad!

78
00:08:14,766 --> 00:08:15,886
I was wrong.

79
00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:51,021
<i>Web, come home.</i>

80
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,880
<i>Don't break Mom's heart anymore.</i>

81
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,800
<i>Web!</i>

82
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,550
<i>Call me back.</i>

83
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,910
<i>Web, I know you feel awful, me too.</i>

84
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,760
<i>We need to talk.</i>

85
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:06,304
<i>Where are you, Web?</i>

86
00:09:06,448 --> 00:09:07,840
<i>Come home.</i>

87
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:09,350
<i>Mom missed you.</i>

88
00:09:32,436 --> 00:09:34,956
<i>Web, our channel is hot!</i>

89
00:09:35,052 --> 00:09:36,292
<i>UG is hot!</i>

90
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,461
<i>We're getting all the attention.</i>

91
00:09:38,944 --> 00:09:40,824
<i>Here's our chance to get rich.</i>

92
00:09:40,984 --> 00:09:42,984
<i>Hurry up and call me back.</i>

93
00:10:22,369 --> 00:10:24,489
Urban Game is here.

94
00:10:24,551 --> 00:10:28,431
This year we're taking you 
to experience what real adventure is.

95
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,620
the exciting Ninja Warrior,

96
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:33,710
and the ever so thrilling 
Dive of Death.

97
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:36,591
We'll let you feel 
your heart beating crazy fast

98
00:10:36,646 --> 00:10:39,046
and we'll get your blood rushing 
through your veins.

99
00:10:39,126 --> 00:10:41,966
We also have a mysterious final game.

100
00:10:42,064 --> 00:10:45,224
Curious now? Join me and dig it

101
00:10:45,293 --> 00:10:48,293
Urban Games Bloody Awesome!

102
00:11:42,829 --> 00:11:44,509
-Sorry!
-What the hell…

103
00:11:48,721 --> 00:11:50,481
<i>When will you get here?</i>

104
00:11:50,539 --> 00:11:52,379
<i>Soon, I'm on my way.</i>

105
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,000
<i>You just left? 
There's a traffic jam on your end.</i>

106
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:57,595
<i>Relax! I can fly.</i>

107
00:11:57,707 --> 00:11:58,867
You'll get me in trouble.

108
00:11:58,964 --> 00:12:00,084
The professor found out

109
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:01,219
I'm letting someone use the lab.

110
00:12:01,284 --> 00:12:02,724
I can only wait for you till 6.

111
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,448
Hurry! I'm leaving
if you're not here by then.

112
00:12:56,548 --> 00:12:57,468
Here I am!

113
00:12:57,699 --> 00:12:59,539
I set up the camera for you already.

114
00:12:59,629 --> 00:13:00,869
You just need to 
put in the tracking device.

115
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,267
You can't use the lab anymore.

116
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,098
Don't worry, this is the last time.

117
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,560
-You must wrap it up tonight.
-This is it.

118
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,880
-Thanks.
-Don't forget to lock up.

119
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,300
Tyler!

120
00:15:09,405 --> 00:15:10,685
How dare you show your face!

121
00:15:27,601 --> 00:15:29,761
Teddy, I came to see you.

122
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:33,956
Don't be such a hypocrite.

123
00:15:34,439 --> 00:15:36,159
You have such a sharp tongue.

124
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:41,199
Look at this, buddy.

125
00:15:53,141 --> 00:15:54,621
Why are you showing me this?

126
00:15:57,613 --> 00:15:58,613
Web…

127
00:16:00,942 --> 00:16:02,382
I only want you to know

128
00:16:02,854 --> 00:16:04,934
UG is hot because of you and Teddy.

129
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,990
You should be proud of yourselves.

130
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,320
My brother is dead,

131
00:16:12,421 --> 00:16:14,541
there's nothing to be proud of.

132
00:16:15,321 --> 00:16:16,281
Web,

133
00:16:16,721 --> 00:16:18,481
I'm sorry about Teddy.

134
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:19,618
It was an accident,

135
00:16:19,713 --> 00:16:20,913
and it was over now.

136
00:16:21,287 --> 00:16:23,640
He invented urban games

137
00:16:23,785 --> 00:16:25,825
you shouldn't
let his baby go to waste.

138
00:16:31,953 --> 00:16:32,953
You're right.

139
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:35,481
Everthing is over now.

140
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,920
Don't ever look me up again.

141
00:16:40,832 --> 00:16:41,912
No, Web…

142
00:16:42,407 --> 00:16:43,967
You belong to this world.

143
00:16:44,197 --> 00:16:46,517
You should come back, 
come away with me.

144
00:16:48,031 --> 00:16:49,151
Do you realize

145
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:51,808
UG is not the same anymore?

146
00:16:51,991 --> 00:16:53,631
It's up and coming.

147
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,080
Trust me, we can do wonders.

148
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,480
I'll take you to a competition.

149
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,160
I even bought your plane ticket.

150
00:17:02,656 --> 00:17:04,296
I'm not interested in UG.

151
00:17:05,422 --> 00:17:06,422
You should leave.

152
00:17:10,173 --> 00:17:11,573
No matter what I say,

153
00:17:11,904 --> 00:17:13,360
you won't come back.

154
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:14,960
Is that right?

155
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,400
Your brother
would have died for nothing.

156
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,310
I'll level with you,

157
00:17:19,698 --> 00:17:23,018
UG can make us a lot of money.

158
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:25,170
We'll be filthy rich, get it?

159
00:17:27,961 --> 00:17:29,321
Listen to me,

160
00:17:30,321 --> 00:17:31,761
my brother Teddy is dead

161
00:17:31,837 --> 00:17:34,317
because of your dream to get rich.

162
00:17:34,816 --> 00:17:35,656
Get out!

163
00:17:36,062 --> 00:17:37,222
Out!

164
00:17:37,513 --> 00:17:38,753
You don't understand,

165
00:17:38,962 --> 00:17:40,402
we can't say no.

166
00:17:41,187 --> 00:17:42,347
Out!

167
00:17:44,305 --> 00:17:45,785
You'll be sorry!

168
00:18:10,886 --> 00:18:11,726
Mom!

169
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,420
Web, you're home!

170
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,266
It's OK!

171
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,040
I missed you so much.

172
00:18:26,888 --> 00:18:27,928
Don't worry.

173
00:18:28,086 --> 00:18:29,406
Where's Syndra?

174
00:18:31,256 --> 00:18:33,176
She hasn't been home for 3 days.

175
00:18:33,232 --> 00:18:34,472
She didn't even bother to call.

176
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:35,674
Nothing.

177
00:18:35,745 --> 00:18:37,065
Not a word.

178
00:18:37,389 --> 00:18:38,669
This child…

179
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,280
Don't worry, 
I'll go up and take a look.

180
00:19:00,213 --> 00:19:01,653
<i>Hello? Who's this?</i>

181
00:19:02,178 --> 00:19:03,218
Where have you been?

182
00:19:03,303 --> 00:19:04,543
Mom is worried sick about you.

183
00:19:05,787 --> 00:19:06,827
<i>You've been had!</i>

184
00:19:06,866 --> 00:19:07,986
<i>This is a recording.</i>

185
00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:09,721
<i>Leave a message after the beep.</i>

186
00:19:12,826 --> 00:19:14,546
What game are you playing?

187
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,100
Give Mom a call.

188
00:19:21,877 --> 00:19:22,717
Hello?

189
00:19:22,797 --> 00:19:23,797

<i>Looking for Syndra?</i>

191
00:19:25,141 --> 00:19:26,021
Tyler!

192
00:19:26,074 --> 00:19:29,154
<i>Do as I say and nobody gets hurt.</i>

193
00:19:30,113 --> 00:19:31,073
Where's my sister?

194
00:19:31,353 --> 00:19:34,153
Don't call the cops or
I can't guarantee

195
00:19:34,225 --> 00:19:35,585
what will happen next.

196
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:38,955
<i>It's not something you want to see.</i>

197
00:19:39,002 --> 00:19:40,002
Tyler!

198
00:19:40,815 --> 00:19:41,895
Tyler!

199
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,620
<i>-Let go of me!
-Get in!</i>

200
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,020
<i>Let me out, jerk!</i>

201
00:19:48,115 --> 00:19:49,475
<i>Let me out!</i>

202
00:19:50,152 --> 00:19:51,152
Open the door!

203
00:19:51,207 --> 00:19:52,607
Let me out!

204
00:19:52,671 --> 00:19:54,031
<i>Let me out!</i>

205
00:19:58,941 --> 00:19:59,781
Hey!

206
00:20:00,525 --> 00:20:01,525
Tyler!

207
00:20:01,973 --> 00:20:04,013
She's your girlfriend, 
what do you want?

208
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:07,550
<i>A smart guy like you 
should know what to do.</i>

209
00:20:07,678 --> 00:20:09,120
Tyler Lee, I swear

210
00:20:09,425 --> 00:20:10,985
if you lay a finger on her

211
00:20:11,056 --> 00:20:12,336
I'll break your damn legs.

212
00:20:12,393 --> 00:20:13,353
Web!

213
00:20:14,683 --> 00:20:16,243
What happened?

214
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:18,391
Nothing.

215
00:20:18,474 --> 00:20:21,034
Mom, I'm going to find Syndra.

216
00:20:22,692 --> 00:20:23,972
Don't worry.

217
00:21:05,477 --> 00:21:07,917
Fresh oranges…

218
00:21:31,881 --> 00:21:32,761
<i>Hello?</i>

219
00:21:33,048 --> 00:21:34,608
Welcome to Seoul.

220
00:21:34,648 --> 00:21:36,008
<i>-Where's my sister?</i>
-Calm down!

221
00:21:36,088 --> 00:21:37,928
She'll be fine if you do as I say.

222
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,360
<i>Look across the street.</i>

223
00:21:39,672 --> 00:21:41,032
<i>Follow them.</i>

224
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,096
What game are you playing?

225
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,580
<i>Don't lose them.</i>

226
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,780
Cut the crap and let her go.

227
00:22:04,844 --> 00:22:06,884
<i>You must join a competition.</i>

228
00:22:06,972 --> 00:22:08,812
Tyler, you jerk!

229
00:22:08,876 --> 00:22:09,996
What competition?

230
00:22:10,218 --> 00:22:11,240
Tyler!

231
00:22:32,243 --> 00:22:34,203
You're with Tyler?

232
00:22:36,842 --> 00:22:38,162
You know Tyler?

233
00:22:38,443 --> 00:22:40,563
Then you must know we're UG.

234
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,760
Where is he?

235
00:22:42,858 --> 00:22:44,298
You have a lot of nerve

236
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,640
starting trouble over here.

237
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,000
Find him yourself!

238
00:22:48,981 --> 00:22:49,901
Wait!

239
00:22:50,461 --> 00:22:52,581
Have you seen a girl called Syndra?

240
00:22:57,602 --> 00:22:58,842
They announced 
the venue of the competition!

241
00:22:58,901 --> 00:22:59,741
Let's go take a look!

242
00:23:14,203 --> 00:23:15,403
Are you crazy?

243
00:23:15,443 --> 00:23:16,323
Sorry!

244
00:23:18,007 --> 00:23:19,767
Lunatic!

245
00:25:02,993 --> 00:25:04,713
Someone beat us here.

246
00:25:04,953 --> 00:25:05,993
Awesome!

247
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,760
Syndra?

248
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,279
Fee, that's cheating.

249
00:25:21,406 --> 00:25:22,646
You were hiding in here.

250
00:25:23,099 --> 00:25:24,499
You were too slow.

251
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,600
How did you get in here?

252
00:25:31,954 --> 00:25:33,194
You have no right to ask me.

253
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:35,313
He's so cocky!

254
00:25:39,188 --> 00:25:42,668
<i>Welcome to the 2013 Urban Games.</i>

<i>Let's all take a good look…</i>

260
00:26:10,959 --> 00:26:12,679

267
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,380
Come out here, jerk!

268
00:26:31,126 --> 00:26:32,166
Where's my sister?

269
00:26:32,526 --> 00:26:33,566
<i>Everyone…</i>

270
00:26:33,647 --> 00:26:35,767
<i>Do you know him?</i>

271
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:40,110
He's Web Zhang.

272
00:26:40,336 --> 00:26:42,656
The biggest name 
in the UG Hall of Fame

273
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,240
Teddy Zhang's brother.

274
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:46,919
Teddy Zhang's brother 
is a UG celebrity.

275
00:26:47,031 --> 00:26:49,231
<i>Yes, the Teddy Zhang,</i>

276
00:26:49,523 --> 00:26:51,563
<i>who invented that daring dive.</i>

<i>Because of him</i>

278
00:26:52,941 --> 00:26:56,901
<i>UG is what it is today.</i>

279

Urban Games

280
00:26:59,788 --> 00:27:00,828
Cut the crap!

281
00:27:00,966 --> 00:27:02,783
-Let my sister go!
-Web.

282
00:27:02,862 --> 00:27:03,702

<i>Or else…</i>

286

Listen up, everyone.

You know the rules

The game is about to begin.

289
00:27:16,956 --> 00:27:19,196
Watch you phones.

290
00:27:20,252 --> 00:27:22,932
Get started once you get the message.

291
00:27:36,939 --> 00:27:37,899
Hey, buddy!

292
00:27:38,388 --> 00:27:39,828
There'll be UG activities

293
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:41,149
want to join in?

294
00:27:41,291 --> 00:27:42,211
We'll see.

295
00:28:15,924 --> 00:28:16,804
Listen…

296
00:28:16,882 --> 00:28:19,922
to save Syndra, do as Tyler say.

297
00:28:45,793 --> 00:28:46,873
That's mine.

298
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:51,759
JJ?

299
00:28:56,933 --> 00:28:57,853
Web!

300
00:28:58,727 --> 00:28:59,647
What are you doing here?

301
00:28:59,941 --> 00:29:01,101
I work here.

302
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,185
You're with Tyler?

303
00:29:10,645 --> 00:29:11,645
He kidnapped my sister.

304
00:29:11,703 --> 00:29:12,823
Are you with him?

305
00:29:13,227 --> 00:29:15,107
Kidnap? What kidnap?

306
00:29:15,195 --> 00:29:17,275
Tyler? No way!

307
00:29:18,986 --> 00:29:21,106
You didn't know 
he kidnapped my sister?

308
00:29:22,881 --> 00:29:23,801
Web.

309
00:29:24,421 --> 00:29:25,781
I just work here.

310
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:28,410
Where is he?

311
00:29:29,165 --> 00:29:31,085
Why did he make me
join this competition?

312
00:29:32,795 --> 00:29:34,075
I really don't know.

313
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:36,919
I haven't seen Tyler in a long time.

314
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,280
He's not the same anymore.

315
00:29:44,468 --> 00:29:45,388
JJ!

316
00:29:46,095 --> 00:29:47,375
I need your help to find him.

317
00:29:49,082 --> 00:29:50,282
I must save Syndra.

318
00:29:50,364 --> 00:29:52,164
No…

319
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:53,917
You don't know what you're up against.

320
00:29:53,979 --> 00:29:56,019
Don't mess with them.

321
00:29:59,365 --> 00:30:00,525
Trust me.

322
00:30:02,671 --> 00:30:03,631
Tell him

323
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,720
I won't let him off the hook.

324
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:34,289
You seem upset, buddy.

325
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,560
What's with this competition?

326
00:30:38,518 --> 00:30:39,718
You don't know?

327
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,200
Beanie, tell him the rules.

328
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:45,254
Tyler and Maja

329
00:30:45,323 --> 00:30:46,883
pick the contestants for each round.

330
00:30:46,957 --> 00:30:49,197
After 3 rounds, we have 4 finalists.

331
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,960
The winner takes home the prize money

332
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:53,599
and gets Maja.

333
00:30:54,088 --> 00:30:55,400
Get it?

334
00:30:55,654 --> 00:30:56,894
You want in?

335
00:30:57,027 --> 00:30:58,187
The competition

336
00:30:58,697 --> 00:30:59,817
I'm in,

337
00:30:59,879 --> 00:31:01,079
as long as I can find Tyler.

338
00:31:01,141 --> 00:31:02,221
You know him well?

339
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:04,767
Not at all.
Ask Fee to find out.

340
00:31:04,827 --> 00:31:05,987
She came with Tyler.

341
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,480
She wasn't one of us.

342
00:31:09,603 --> 00:31:10,683
What does she do?

343
00:31:11,296 --> 00:31:12,336
Hard to say.

344
00:31:12,428 --> 00:31:14,668
She has a bookstore nearby.

345
00:31:15,545 --> 00:31:17,065
How about a game?

346
00:31:17,182 --> 00:31:19,782
Snooker? You go ahead.

347
00:32:13,961 --> 00:32:15,000
Hey!

348
00:32:15,136 --> 00:32:17,456
<i>What are you looking for, Web?</i>

349
00:32:17,723 --> 00:32:19,003
I don't know what you mean.

350
00:32:19,147 --> 00:32:21,667
You haven't been listening.

351
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:25,088
<i>Don't tell me you're taking a walk.</i>

352
00:32:25,163 --> 00:32:26,763
You put me under surveillance?

353
00:32:26,972 --> 00:32:28,532
<i>Let me talk to my sister,</i>

354
00:32:28,677 --> 00:32:30,237
or I won't sign up for the compeition.

355
00:32:33,986 --> 00:32:37,266
Fine! I'll let you talk to Syndra.

356
00:32:37,443 --> 00:32:39,083
<i>But you must finish the competition</i>

357
00:32:39,219 --> 00:32:41,619
<i>before I can guarantee her safety.</i>

358
00:32:42,918 --> 00:32:46,678
Or else even I can't help you.

359
00:32:49,026 --> 00:32:52,786
<i>Syndra, guess who's here.</i>

360
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,320
Who are you? Let me out!

361
00:32:56,409 --> 00:32:58,569
Syndra, it's me.

362
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,460
Web?

363
00:33:01,691 --> 00:33:02,720
Web?

364
00:33:03,344 --> 00:33:04,664
<i>Is that you?</i>

365
00:33:05,248 --> 00:33:06,368
<i>Where are you?</i>

366
00:33:06,523 --> 00:33:07,883
Can you hear me?

367
00:33:08,078 --> 00:33:09,038
Are you alright?

368
00:33:09,167 --> 00:33:10,207
Are you hurt?

369
00:33:10,334 --> 00:33:11,494
<i>No, Web.</i>

370
00:33:11,577 --> 00:33:12,897
<i>Get me out.</i>

371
00:33:13,078 --> 00:33:14,198
Do you know

372
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:16,010
Tyler is behind this?

373
00:33:16,802 --> 00:33:18,002
Web!

374
00:33:18,503 --> 00:33:19,383
Web!

375
00:33:19,447 --> 00:33:20,327
Syndra!

376
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,240
Syndra!

377
00:33:26,806 --> 00:33:27,926
Tyler!

378
00:33:28,488 --> 00:33:30,208
Happy now?

379
00:33:30,611 --> 00:33:32,251
Syndra's safety

380
00:33:32,653 --> 00:33:34,173
<i>depends on you.</i>

381
00:33:34,351 --> 00:33:37,151
If you win, you'll get her back.

382
00:33:37,212 --> 00:33:38,212
Tyler Lee!

383
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,360
If my sister so much as loses a hair,
I will…

384
00:33:40,413 --> 00:33:41,893
If you listened to me
in the first place

385
00:33:42,212 --> 00:33:44,412
<i>none of this would have happened.</i>

386
00:33:45,431 --> 00:33:47,231
There's no turning back for us.

387
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:49,485
You must finish the competition.

388
00:33:49,925 --> 00:33:51,365
<i>Do we have a deal?</i>

389
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:52,869
I'll do it

390
00:33:53,158 --> 00:33:54,318
<i>on one condition.</i>

391
00:33:54,406 --> 00:33:56,606
No harm must come to my sister.

392
00:33:56,837 --> 00:33:58,397
Welcome back, Web.

393
00:33:58,879 --> 00:34:01,759
You will turn UG into a frenzy.

394
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:57,731
It's alright, Grandpa. I'll do it.

395
00:35:07,142 --> 00:35:08,382
What are you doing here?

396
00:35:10,406 --> 00:35:11,726
Just browsing.

397
00:35:19,061 --> 00:35:20,301
Let me help you.

398
00:35:20,688 --> 00:35:21,648
Don't worry.

399
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,920
I'll do it.

400
00:35:25,992 --> 00:35:27,072
You can go.

401
00:36:07,528 --> 00:36:08,408
Long time no see.

402
00:36:08,454 --> 00:36:09,494
Long time no see.

403
00:36:17,076 --> 00:36:17,956
Coke.

404
00:36:18,269 --> 00:36:19,949
Look who's here.

405
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,360
Are you ready?

406
00:36:31,636 --> 00:36:32,956
Why wouldn't I be?

407
00:36:48,745 --> 00:36:50,825
<i>The exciting moment is upon us.</i>

408
00:36:50,921 --> 00:36:51,961
<i>Allow me to introduce</i>

409
00:36:52,098 --> 00:36:54,858
<i>the Ninja Warriors</i>

410
00:36:55,106 --> 00:36:56,666
<i>of the first round.</i>

411
00:36:57,402 --> 00:36:58,562
<i>The rules are simple.</i>

412
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:02,113
<i>The minute the contestants jump down,</i>

413
00:37:02,185 --> 00:37:03,865
<i>we don't care how they do it,</i>

414
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:05,530
<i>the first person to go through
the UG obstacle</i>

415
00:37:05,603 --> 00:37:07,403
<i>and lands on top of the container</i>

416
00:37:07,468 --> 00:37:09,068
<i>is the winner.</i>

417
00:37:09,218 --> 00:37:11,378
<i>He can claim 
the prize money of $10,000 USD</i>

418
00:37:11,465 --> 00:37:14,305
<i>and enter the next round.</i>

419
00:37:15,422 --> 00:37:16,342
<i>Maja,</i>

420
00:37:16,562 --> 00:37:18,402
<i>over to you.</i>

421
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,800
Lancelot!

422
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:32,970
He's likely to win,

423
00:37:33,034 --> 00:37:34,874
because he's a brilliant rock climber.

424
00:37:34,946 --> 00:37:35,746
Red!

425
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,800
She's trained in Brazilian Jiu-jitsu

426
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,800
and she's quite good.

427
00:37:39,832 --> 00:37:41,112
How does she know who to pick?

428
00:37:42,832 --> 00:37:44,712
She seems to be taking orders 
from someone.

429
00:37:45,065 --> 00:37:46,705
-Yes!
-UG is hot,

430
00:37:46,752 --> 00:37:48,672
people want to make money from it,

431
00:37:48,743 --> 00:37:50,223
and bets are being made.

432
00:37:50,331 --> 00:37:51,531
It's likely Maja is working for

433
00:37:51,584 --> 00:37:52,944
some big shot 
who controls the competition.

434
00:37:53,026 --> 00:37:54,666
The stakes are high.

435
00:37:55,939 --> 00:37:57,219
T-Devil!

436
00:37:57,465 --> 00:38:00,065
This bastard plays dirty.

437
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:03,179
He gets on my nerves.

438
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:04,674
Randy, David, Beanie!

439
00:38:04,851 --> 00:38:06,331
Come on down!

440
00:38:06,793 --> 00:38:08,993
<i>Yes, all UG experts!</i>

441
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:13,959
Fee!

442
00:38:20,213 --> 00:38:22,973
<i>Everyone seems to like her!</i>

443
00:38:24,741 --> 00:38:26,061
And finally…

444
00:38:26,956 --> 00:38:29,316
that's right, Web Zhang.

445
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:34,690
<i>You won't be disappointed.</i>

446
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:36,354
<i>The PK between experts</i>

447
00:38:36,418 --> 00:38:38,218
<i>gets no blessings from God.</i>

448
00:38:38,555 --> 00:38:41,115
<i>A tough rival does not mean fear.</i>

449
00:38:41,367 --> 00:38:43,407
<i>Who will be the champ?</i>

450
00:38:43,457 --> 00:38:44,377
<i>Red?</i>

451
00:38:44,497 --> 00:38:45,417
<i>David?</i>

452
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:46,329
<i>Lancelot?</i>

453
00:38:46,401 --> 00:38:47,321
<i>Web?</i>

454
00:38:47,393 --> 00:38:48,273
<i>T-Devil?</i>

455
00:38:48,321 --> 00:38:50,481
<i>Or your favorite Fee?</i>

456
00:38:50,526 --> 00:38:52,406
<i>Root for the champ of your choice.</i>

457
00:38:52,569 --> 00:38:54,729
<i>Anything is possible!</i>

458
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:56,239
<i>3…</i>

459
00:38:57,146 --> 00:38:58,546
<i>2…</i>

460
00:38:59,942 --> 00:39:01,222
<i>1…</i>

461
00:39:05,928 --> 00:39:09,408
<i>The contestants 
started almost simultaneously!</i>

462
00:39:11,951 --> 00:39:15,671
<i>It's hard to say who has the lead.</i>

463
00:39:21,356 --> 00:39:24,516
<i>Everyone has jumped over 
the first wall,</i>

464
00:39:24,637 --> 00:39:29,040
<i>and showing their colors 
to overcome the second.</i>

465
00:39:30,779 --> 00:39:34,899
<i>Red and Fee are tangled up.</i>

466
00:39:35,364 --> 00:39:38,804
<i>Web took a kick on the climbing wall.</i>

467
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,480
<i>The heat is on…</i>

468
00:39:42,767 --> 00:39:45,087
<i>and competition 
is exceptionally cruel.</i>

469
00:39:50,149 --> 00:39:52,755
<i>Beanie is out!</i>

470
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,160
You're quick!

471
00:40:01,053 --> 00:40:02,933
<i>Red is down!</i>

472
00:40:03,019 --> 00:40:05,339
<i>All is lost if you're not careful,</i>

473
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,320
<i>and the champion title 
is gone forever.</i>

474
00:40:09,064 --> 00:40:10,984
<i>You think this is cruel?</i>

475
00:40:11,384 --> 00:40:14,304
<i>No, if you persist,</i>

476
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,090
<i>the UG world</i>

477
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:18,130
<i>can unmask its icy veil for you.</i>

478
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,120
Serve you right!

479
00:40:23,492 --> 00:40:25,852
<i>There's no such thing as luck,</i>

480
00:40:25,939 --> 00:40:28,619
<i>only the battle of strenghts.</i>

481
00:40:50,137 --> 00:40:51,177
Watch out!

482
00:40:52,344 --> 00:40:53,464
Hang on!

483
00:40:54,002 --> 00:40:57,522
<i>Web saved the damsel in distress!</i>

484
00:40:57,669 --> 00:40:59,349
<i>Our shoo-in</i>

485
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:02,340
<i>threw in the towel at the last minute.</i>

486
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:06,143
<i>No man 
can resist a pretty lady indeed.</i>

487
00:41:07,169 --> 00:41:09,689
<i>T Devil and David 
both have a definite edge.</i>

488
00:41:09,749 --> 00:41:11,629
<i>They are both inside the UG obstacle.</i>

489
00:41:12,823 --> 00:41:16,143
<i>Who will be the winner?</i>

490
00:41:21,684 --> 00:41:23,684
<i>Winner of Round 1 is…</i>

491
00:41:24,957 --> 00:41:25,997
<i>David!</i>

492
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,360
<i>Is he the dark horse?</i>

493
00:41:28,425 --> 00:41:30,185
<i>The competition has just begun.</i>

494
00:41:30,261 --> 00:41:31,581
<i>Let's wait and see.</i>

495
00:41:31,646 --> 00:41:33,246
T Devil, you're no match for me.

496
00:41:35,689 --> 00:41:37,689
Just wait, David.

497
00:41:40,433 --> 00:41:43,313
<i>Brilliant, David! That was perfect!</i>

498
00:41:49,575 --> 00:41:51,560
Cheers, Web!

499
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:56,961
My hat's off to you!

500
00:41:57,024 --> 00:41:59,024
You saved Fee 
because you want to hit on her?

501
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,560
Fee!

502
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,360
Can I have a word?

503
00:42:35,018 --> 00:42:36,578
Are you alright?

504
00:42:38,167 --> 00:42:39,967
I didn't expect you to be so heavy,

505
00:42:40,172 --> 00:42:42,012
you almost pulled off my arm!

506
00:42:44,048 --> 00:42:45,208
I'm sorry!

507
00:42:45,916 --> 00:42:47,240
I didn't mean to!

508
00:42:48,244 --> 00:42:50,124
I don't think you came here 
to thank me.

509
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:52,915
No.

510
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:59,930
I have something to show you.

511
00:43:08,257 --> 00:43:09,617
I just found out

512
00:43:09,721 --> 00:43:11,121
they've been watching you.

513
00:43:11,347 --> 00:43:12,507
Who are they?

514
00:43:14,326 --> 00:43:15,406
Tyler!

515
00:43:17,115 --> 00:43:18,315
Why him?

516
00:43:18,832 --> 00:43:20,152
They look like henchmen.

517
00:43:30,163 --> 00:43:32,243
You said Tyler kidnapped your sister.

518
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:33,803
Why did he do it?

519
00:43:34,046 --> 00:43:35,206
Who knows?

520
00:43:35,617 --> 00:43:36,777
It's crazy!

521
00:43:39,631 --> 00:43:41,031
Probably for money!

522
00:43:42,547 --> 00:43:43,667
UG…

523
00:43:43,738 --> 00:43:45,338
is not the same anymore.

524
00:43:46,447 --> 00:43:48,247
It's all about money now.

525
00:43:48,457 --> 00:43:49,977
Tyler kidnapped my sister,

526
00:43:50,714 --> 00:43:52,114
and forced me to compete.

527
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,440
I guess he did it
to attract more attention

528
00:43:56,156 --> 00:43:58,076
so they can make more money.

529
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:05,400
If the winner gets a huge reward,

530
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:06,850
that means UG

531
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:08,510
will make a lot more.

532
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:11,310
If so much money is involved,

533
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:15,590
is it possible someone else 
is behind Tyler?

534
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,440
Who else?

535
00:44:17,862 --> 00:44:19,702
My friend is an accountant.

536
00:44:20,437 --> 00:44:22,237
I can ask him to find out

537
00:44:22,367 --> 00:44:23,767
about UG's structure.

538
00:44:24,955 --> 00:44:25,875
Good!

539
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:36,733
Thanks! You need not have bothered.

540
00:44:37,899 --> 00:44:39,139
At the competition today,

541
00:44:39,252 --> 00:44:40,652
you need not have bothered either.

542
00:45:20,726 --> 00:45:21,766
Syndra!

543
00:45:23,837 --> 00:45:24,917
<i>Syndra!</i>

544
00:45:34,124 --> 00:45:35,124
My dear…

545
00:45:35,294 --> 00:45:37,334
Don't forget what the Boss said.

546
00:45:47,913 --> 00:45:49,633
I looked into UG.

547
00:45:49,714 --> 00:45:51,274
The company's investment portfolio

548
00:45:51,353 --> 00:45:52,513
seems to be in order.

549
00:45:52,563 --> 00:45:54,923
20 employees, an annual profit of $6m

550
00:45:55,003 --> 00:45:56,643
and enjoying steady growth.

551
00:45:56,823 --> 00:45:58,343
But a few months ago,

552
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,000
an investment company called Bandes

553
00:46:00,063 --> 00:46:01,143
took control of it.

554
00:46:01,605 --> 00:46:02,965
And here's the problem.

555
00:46:03,038 --> 00:46:05,358
I can't find anything on them.

556
00:46:07,867 --> 00:46:09,187
What does that mean?

557
00:46:10,465 --> 00:46:11,545
Look…

558
00:46:14,487 --> 00:46:16,912
Most financial reports
and any information on management

559
00:46:16,985 --> 00:46:18,465
are usually shown here.

560
00:46:18,535 --> 00:46:19,815
But Bandes

561
00:46:20,292 --> 00:46:21,572
left this blank.

562
00:46:22,072 --> 00:46:25,352
I suspect
they have something to hide.

563
00:46:26,308 --> 00:46:28,108
You're saying

564
00:46:28,428 --> 00:46:30,468
it's a shell company?

565
00:46:30,938 --> 00:46:32,298
I think so.

566
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:36,730
Young man,

567
00:46:36,834 --> 00:46:39,074
whatever is your connection to Bandes,

568
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:40,211
I don't care.

569
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:42,339
Just leave her out of it.

570
00:46:42,434 --> 00:46:43,434
OK?

571
00:46:46,231 --> 00:46:47,751
Thank you, Uncle Meng.

572
00:47:00,022 --> 00:47:01,062
A relative?

573
00:47:01,863 --> 00:47:04,383
No.
He was my Dad's best friend.

574
00:47:05,862 --> 00:47:08,102
What's your plan?

575
00:47:11,031 --> 00:47:13,271
I must save my sister, no matter what.

576
00:47:13,691 --> 00:47:15,531
I will continue to compete.

577
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:43,072
I'm tired of waiting.

578
00:47:43,113 --> 00:47:44,633
Whateve will come, will come.

579
00:47:47,429 --> 00:47:48,869
David, are you ready

580
00:47:48,913 --> 00:47:50,033
to let me beat you.

581
00:47:50,126 --> 00:47:52,286
I think I beat you last time.

582
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,040
<i>Hello, everyone!</i>

583
00:47:56,411 --> 00:47:58,411
<i>We meet again!</i>

584
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,960
<i>Are you ready for Round 2?</i>

585
00:48:02,854 --> 00:48:04,334
<i>Ladies and gentlement</i>

586
00:48:04,393 --> 00:48:05,793
<i>and fellow contestants,</i>

587
00:48:06,118 --> 00:48:07,520
<i>allow me to present</i>

588
00:48:07,625 --> 00:48:08,985
<i>the Dive of Death.</i>

589
00:48:09,169 --> 00:48:10,849
<i>The PK between experts</i>

590
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:12,660
<i>is romantic and fearful,</i>

591
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:14,340
<i>real and dreamy.</i>

592
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:15,660
<i>The Platform of Death</i>

593
00:48:15,763 --> 00:48:17,683
<i>is this 80m tall cooling tower.</i>

594
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:19,660
<i>It is divided into 4 levels.</i>

595
00:48:19,765 --> 00:48:21,405
<i>The gap between each level is 20m.</i>

596
00:48:21,518 --> 00:48:24,638
<i>At the bottom 
is a high speed centrifuge,</i>

597
00:48:24,781 --> 00:48:26,941
<i>powerful enough to turn over a truck.</i>

598
00:48:27,015 --> 00:48:29,335
<i>The successful diver</i>

599
00:48:29,416 --> 00:48:31,296
<i>can take home $50,000 USD</i>

600
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,240
<i>and qualify for the next round</i>

601
00:48:33,296 --> 00:48:35,816
<i>for the $100,000 final.</i>

602
00:48:42,326 --> 00:48:43,926
<i>Let's get a feel of</i>

603
00:48:44,039 --> 00:48:47,919
<i>the thrill and danger,</i>

604
00:48:54,155 --> 00:48:55,715
<i>the real UG.</i>

605
00:48:55,809 --> 00:48:59,289
Urban Games Bloody Awesome!

606
00:48:59,346 --> 00:49:00,346
Let's go!

607
00:49:11,383 --> 00:49:13,743
<i>We have 6 contestants.</i>

608
00:49:14,407 --> 00:49:15,767
<i>This is the most exciting</i>

609
00:49:15,829 --> 00:49:18,229
<i>and nerve wrecking competition.</i>

610
00:49:18,307 --> 00:49:19,800
<i>The fate of the diver</i>

611
00:49:19,856 --> 00:49:22,936
<i>lies is that deadly jump.</i>

612
00:49:23,031 --> 00:49:25,320
<i>This is the testimony</i>

613
00:49:25,410 --> 00:49:28,930
<i>to UG's unyielding spirit.</i>

614
00:49:28,978 --> 00:49:31,418
<i>At this moment, 
it is more than a competition,</i>

615
00:49:31,474 --> 00:49:32,714
<i>it is also a battle</i>

616
00:49:32,858 --> 00:49:35,138
<i>of the body and soul.</i>

617
00:49:35,524 --> 00:49:39,124
<i>UG means the will power to win.</i>

618
00:49:42,507 --> 00:49:43,707
Ready…

619
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:57,840
Damn!

620
00:50:09,394 --> 00:50:12,714
<i>That jump doesn't look good!</i>

621
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:47,200
<i>I bet it hurts.</i>

622
00:50:47,274 --> 00:50:50,114
<i>He has obviously forgotten 
about gravity.</i>

623
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:05,640
<i>David remains the dark horse.</i>

624
00:51:06,472 --> 00:51:09,992
<i>Fee is on Level 4,</i>

625
00:51:10,196 --> 00:51:13,036
<i>taking on the challenge 
from the highest point.</i>

626
00:51:13,093 --> 00:51:16,533
<i>What fate will await her? 
Defeat or glory?</i>

627
00:51:32,872 --> 00:51:34,912
<i>A new dark horse is born!</i>

628
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,320
<i>Fee is the champion!</i>

629
00:51:37,542 --> 00:51:39,942
<i>Awesome!</i>

630
00:51:40,171 --> 00:51:43,291
<i>Fee overcame her own limit.</i>

631
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:46,050
<i>This is what UG is all about!</i>

632
00:51:46,925 --> 00:51:50,358
<i>Hold on…we have forgotten someone.</i>

633
00:51:50,653 --> 00:51:51,653
<i>Web!</i>

634
00:51:51,756 --> 00:51:53,356
<i>Where is he? Bring him in!</i>

635
00:51:53,502 --> 00:51:55,662
But where?

636
00:51:55,736 --> 00:51:57,896
Where is Web? Did he go home?

637
00:52:01,226 --> 00:52:02,586
Where is he?

638
00:52:05,792 --> 00:52:06,672
Where is Web?

639
00:52:06,722 --> 00:52:08,762
He's at the top of the tower.

640
00:52:17,863 --> 00:52:18,863
Web!

641
00:52:19,143 --> 00:52:20,343
The jump tomorrow

642
00:52:20,397 --> 00:52:21,757
is tailor made for you.

643
00:52:22,008 --> 00:52:24,048
You lost Round 1,

644
00:52:24,121 --> 00:52:25,921
don't let us down again.

645
00:52:26,346 --> 00:52:29,506
You know what to do.

646
00:52:29,738 --> 00:52:32,138
Have you decided, Web?

647
00:52:32,346 --> 00:52:33,826
Isn't this what you want?

648
00:52:33,905 --> 00:52:35,945
I want to see you in the final.

649
00:52:36,222 --> 00:52:39,062
This is suicide, you won't make it.

650
00:52:39,164 --> 00:52:40,684
Anything is possible!

651
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:42,100
You'll see!

652
00:52:42,815 --> 00:52:44,135
Very well.

653
00:52:44,524 --> 00:52:46,844
Let us give this daring lunatic

654
00:52:46,933 --> 00:52:48,453
a great big cheer!

655
00:52:48,736 --> 00:52:49,736
Web Zhang!

656
00:52:49,786 --> 00:52:51,560
Go for it!

657
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:58,720
Urban Games Bloody Awesome!

658
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:45,680
You're awake?

659
00:55:46,952 --> 00:55:48,352
Can I join you?

660
00:56:05,652 --> 00:56:06,692
Can you dance?

661
00:56:07,132 --> 00:56:08,172
Teach me.

662
00:57:54,212 --> 00:57:55,172
Morning!

663
00:57:56,612 --> 00:57:57,492
Morning!

664
00:58:00,789 --> 00:58:04,629
When you jumped

665
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,760
I was really scared.

666
00:58:11,339 --> 00:58:14,699
I haven't been this scared 
in a long time.

667
00:58:17,925 --> 00:58:20,045
I remember last night

668
00:58:21,134 --> 00:58:22,694
there was nice music,

669
00:58:24,717 --> 00:58:25,837
the lights

670
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:29,790
and you.

671
00:58:38,545 --> 00:58:39,745
Does it still hurt?

672
00:58:53,694 --> 00:58:55,414
To be able to dance

673
00:58:55,958 --> 00:58:57,958
was once my biggest dream.

674
00:58:58,697 --> 00:59:00,417
Why did you give it up?

675
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:16,880
I stopped dancing 
when my parents died.

676
00:59:18,266 --> 00:59:20,146
I only dance for those I love.

677
00:59:25,713 --> 00:59:26,793
Sorry!

678
00:59:28,313 --> 00:59:29,353
It's OK!

679
00:59:29,549 --> 00:59:30,909
That was a long time ago.

680
00:59:33,234 --> 00:59:34,674
After they died,

681
00:59:34,786 --> 00:59:36,786
they left the bookstore 
to me and Grandpa.

682
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:41,280
Grandpa is getting on in years

683
00:59:41,488 --> 00:59:42,808
and business is bad.

684
00:59:43,856 --> 00:59:45,296
If this keeps up,

685
00:59:46,192 --> 00:59:47,752
the bookstore 
will close down eventually.

686
01:00:02,396 --> 01:00:04,596
That's why you want to win?

687
01:00:05,083 --> 01:00:07,003
I'm surprised you're quite smart!

688
01:00:09,798 --> 01:00:14,838
But you won the Dive of Death.

689
01:00:15,979 --> 01:00:16,939
Me?

690
01:00:17,139 --> 01:00:18,179
Don't you remember?

691
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,920
When you jumped

692
01:00:25,710 --> 01:00:27,270
we all thought you'd be dead for sure.

693
01:00:30,461 --> 01:00:33,781
But you were 
the closest to the ground.

694
01:00:36,087 --> 01:00:37,927
You qualified for the next round.

695
01:00:48,062 --> 01:00:49,382
I had no choice.

696
01:00:50,776 --> 01:00:53,496
This is the only way 
to save my sister.

697
01:01:04,805 --> 01:01:06,085
You can do it.

698
01:01:14,127 --> 01:01:16,847
I think I want to dance again.

699
01:01:31,383 --> 01:01:32,303
Bye!

700
01:01:52,634 --> 01:01:54,194
What are you doing?

701
01:02:21,002 --> 01:02:22,482
-Out of the way…
-What?

702
01:02:38,863 --> 01:02:39,863
Stop!

703
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,200
Don't move!

704
01:03:06,526 --> 01:03:07,886
Where did he go?

705
01:03:08,979 --> 01:03:10,499
-Damn!
-Shit!

706
01:03:30,702 --> 01:03:33,022
Listen to me, Web.

707
01:03:33,742 --> 01:03:35,422
It's not what you think

708
01:03:35,776 --> 01:03:37,256
Or what I have imagined.

709
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:38,991
You kidnapped Syndra.

710
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:41,120
Someday you'll understand.

711
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:42,060
Web…

712
01:03:42,492 --> 01:03:44,932
the last round you must…

713
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:47,000
Tyler!

714
01:03:47,805 --> 01:03:49,565
You're too smart

715
01:03:49,752 --> 01:03:51,632
to do something stupid.

716
01:03:52,014 --> 01:03:53,134
<i>Hello?</i>

717
01:03:54,041 --> 01:03:54,881
<i>Hello?</i>

718
01:03:54,969 --> 01:03:56,369
After you finish everything

719
01:03:56,451 --> 01:04:00,331
Syndra, Web and you are free to go.

720
01:04:01,230 --> 01:04:03,190
Finish the game properly,

721
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:05,350
do what you have to.

722
01:04:05,791 --> 01:04:06,791
Tyler!

723
01:04:07,635 --> 01:04:08,875
Say something!

724
01:04:14,232 --> 01:04:15,272
Web!

725
01:04:16,248 --> 01:04:18,688
We have eyes on you.

726
01:04:19,164 --> 01:04:21,084
You better finish the competition.

727
01:04:21,730 --> 01:04:23,730
<i>Tyler, you jerk!</i>

728
01:04:23,810 --> 01:04:25,090
I'm helping you.

729
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,320
<i>You better keep your promise.</i>

730
01:04:27,759 --> 01:04:29,119
You don't even know

731
01:04:29,307 --> 01:04:31,107
who you're up against.

732
01:04:49,974 --> 01:04:51,094
Are you alright?

733
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:20,110
See you at the finishing line.

734
01:05:20,254 --> 01:05:21,454
You'll win for sure!

735
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:30,880
David, don't celebrate too early!

736
01:05:38,291 --> 01:05:39,491
<i>On your marks!</i>

737
01:05:40,854 --> 01:05:42,414
<i>You have 8 minutes.</i>

738
01:05:42,507 --> 01:05:44,827
<i>The first person
to reach the finishing line wins.</i>

739
01:05:44,944 --> 01:05:46,904
<i>You're free to choose your own route,</i>

740
01:05:47,027 --> 01:05:48,467
<i>do whatever it takes.</i>

741
01:05:48,616 --> 01:05:51,496
<i>The viewers want something explosive.</i>

742
01:05:51,562 --> 01:05:53,162
<i>Have a nice ride!</i>

743
01:05:53,214 --> 01:05:54,374
<i>Go!</i>

744
01:06:18,419 --> 01:06:21,339
<i>4 contestants
chose the shortest route,</i>

745
01:06:21,418 --> 01:06:24,138
<i>but both routes are bumpy.</i>

746
01:06:24,284 --> 01:06:27,404
<i>Will they reach the city in time?</i>

747
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:48,720
<i>Brilliant! That only took 90 seconds.</i>

748
01:06:49,269 --> 01:06:53,349
<i>Both contestants reached 
the city almost simultaneously.</i>

749
01:06:53,462 --> 01:06:55,262
<i>Don't hesitate,</i>

750
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:59,775
<i>place your bets and win the big prize.</i>

751
01:07:29,511 --> 01:07:32,351
<i>Oh no! Fee is down!</i>

752
01:07:32,432 --> 01:07:35,872
<i>She's currently the favorite to win.</i>

753
01:07:36,171 --> 01:07:38,371
<i>David is trapped as well.</i>

754
01:07:39,937 --> 01:07:42,937
<i>But Fee turned things around!</i>

755
01:07:43,004 --> 01:07:47,004
<i>That's what's so brilliant about life!</i>

756
01:07:55,237 --> 01:07:57,597
<i>T Devil's fall is tragic!</i>

757
01:09:14,907 --> 01:09:16,187
What now?

758
01:09:38,101 --> 01:09:39,221
Fee!

759
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:47,680
David!

760
01:09:47,719 --> 01:09:48,599
David!

761
01:09:49,537 --> 01:09:50,857
-Are you alright?
-David!

762
01:09:53,326 --> 01:09:54,566
David!

763
01:09:58,372 --> 01:09:59,732
This baby came in handy.

764
01:09:59,992 --> 01:10:01,032
I'm fine.

765
01:10:01,732 --> 01:10:03,452
Who would take a shot at us?

766
01:10:04,606 --> 01:10:07,166
Looks like
someone doesn't want you to win.

767
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:14,900
Syndra!

768
01:11:25,093 --> 01:11:26,893
So much for you prize money!

769
01:11:26,989 --> 01:11:29,429
I've been watching you, smart guy!

770
01:11:30,638 --> 01:11:32,518
How dare you bet against the Boss!

771
01:11:32,718 --> 01:11:34,198
You think you can fool him?

772
01:11:34,334 --> 01:11:36,094
I've been monitoring your computer.

773
01:11:36,668 --> 01:11:37,748
Moron!

774
01:11:37,972 --> 01:11:38,972
My dear…

775
01:11:39,204 --> 01:11:41,044
why don't you ever listen?

776
01:11:43,207 --> 01:11:44,287
Jerk!

777
01:11:50,031 --> 01:11:51,311
Here's a memento for you.

778
01:11:51,496 --> 01:11:53,336
Goodbye, buddy!

779
01:11:56,475 --> 01:11:58,275
I'll get back at you.

780
01:12:38,302 --> 01:12:40,342
-Syndra!
-Web, be careful!

781
01:12:40,422 --> 01:12:41,582
They're armed.

782
01:12:42,455 --> 01:12:44,335
Tyler, let my sister go!

783
01:12:49,141 --> 01:12:50,221
JJ?

784
01:12:50,597 --> 01:12:51,597
It's you!?

785
01:12:51,997 --> 01:12:53,197
Surprised?

786
01:12:53,909 --> 01:12:55,029
Of course..

787
01:12:55,452 --> 01:12:56,692
in your eyes…

788
01:12:56,741 --> 01:12:58,341
I'm just another nobody

789
01:12:58,446 --> 01:12:59,846
and I shouldn't be here.

790
01:12:59,910 --> 01:13:02,320
I'm sorry to let you down.

791
01:13:02,661 --> 01:13:03,661
Let my sister go!

792
01:13:03,837 --> 01:13:04,997
You think I'm a moron?

793
01:13:05,070 --> 01:13:06,670
Why would I let my hostage go?

794
01:13:06,798 --> 01:13:08,198
Why did you do it?

795
01:13:11,578 --> 01:13:12,858
Need you even ask?

796
01:13:12,955 --> 01:13:15,995
All these years, what have I got?

797
01:13:16,639 --> 01:13:17,959
Nothing!

798
01:13:18,069 --> 01:13:19,069
You're the same.

799
01:13:19,159 --> 01:13:21,719
You hogged the limelight, 
who cares about me?

800
01:13:23,296 --> 01:13:24,296
Well?

801
01:13:24,383 --> 01:13:27,423
How does it feel to be manipulated?

802
01:13:27,896 --> 01:13:29,016
JJ,

803
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:31,480
we never asked for anything.

804
01:13:32,505 --> 01:13:35,185
We always treated you 
like our brother.

805
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:41,546
Bullshit! I was never your brother.

806
01:13:41,698 --> 01:13:42,858
No?

807
01:13:42,971 --> 01:13:44,811
You have no right to give me orders.

808
01:13:48,358 --> 01:13:49,278
Freeze! Drop your weapons!

809
01:13:49,325 --> 01:13:50,245
Drop it!

810
01:13:50,965 --> 01:13:51,885
Get down!

811
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:57,000
This way! Hurry…

812
01:14:03,171 --> 01:14:04,171
Come in!

813
01:14:05,266 --> 01:14:06,186
Blood!

814
01:14:14,674 --> 01:14:17,634
Be careful!

815
01:14:25,922 --> 01:14:28,402
You must have questions for me.

816
01:14:28,774 --> 01:14:30,534
Did you kidnap Syndra?

817
01:14:32,419 --> 01:14:33,779
Of course not!

818
01:14:35,105 --> 01:14:37,305
If I don't do as they say,

819
01:14:37,607 --> 01:14:38,927
Syndra will get hurt.

820
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:39,900
Jerk!

821
01:14:40,641 --> 01:14:42,481
You knew they kidnapped me

822
01:14:42,642 --> 01:14:44,202
but you still worked for them.

823
01:14:44,702 --> 01:14:46,222
I'm sorry, Syndra.

824
01:14:47,356 --> 01:14:49,156
You have no idea 
what they're capable of!

825
01:14:49,493 --> 01:14:50,813
I had no choice.

826
01:14:53,417 --> 01:14:57,017
But Web, I'm on your side.

827
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:58,800
I bet heavily on you.

828
01:14:59,248 --> 01:15:00,888
I wanted to make a lot of money.

829
01:15:01,833 --> 01:15:05,593
You did it for yourself!

830
01:15:06,071 --> 01:15:07,511
Don't listen to him!

831
01:15:07,578 --> 01:15:09,618
Why else am I here?

832
01:15:10,910 --> 01:15:11,950
Syndra!

833
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:15,720
I have always loved you.

834
01:15:16,122 --> 01:15:17,842
I will prove it to you.

835
01:15:21,549 --> 01:15:22,509
Tyler!

836
01:15:23,996 --> 01:15:25,316
You're under arrest!

837
01:15:29,312 --> 01:15:30,672
You're a cop?

838
01:15:30,886 --> 01:15:31,806
That's right!

839
01:15:31,853 --> 01:15:33,093
We're onto them for a long time.

840
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:41,800
Take him away.

841
01:16:09,866 --> 01:16:11,626
JJ and Maja got away.

842
01:16:13,146 --> 01:16:14,666
They couldn't have gone very far.

843
01:16:16,491 --> 01:16:18,811
I wanted to use this to find Tyler,

844
01:16:19,279 --> 01:16:22,239
now this should come in handy.

845
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:26,640
In order to repay you

846
01:16:26,792 --> 01:16:28,272
I have a present for you.

847
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:56,640
Web, JJ and Maja have been arrested.

848
01:16:56,774 --> 01:16:58,494
But UG is still running.

849
01:16:58,998 --> 01:17:01,198
The mastermind behind 
will surface soon.

850
01:17:01,412 --> 01:17:02,812
I need your help.

851
01:17:07,245 --> 01:17:08,685
Can you hear me, Web?

852
01:17:09,277 --> 01:17:11,917
Audio and visual are clear.

853
01:17:12,021 --> 01:17:13,221
Wind speed normal.

854
01:17:17,017 --> 01:17:19,777
Teddy, we missed you.

855
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:24,200
Don't worry, we're fine.

856
01:17:24,522 --> 01:17:25,682
Web,

857
01:17:26,755 --> 01:17:28,675
Teddy would have been so proud of you.

858
01:17:33,471 --> 01:17:36,751
Teddy, let's root for Web.

859
01:17:36,981 --> 01:17:39,661
He'll make your wish come true today.

860
01:17:52,936 --> 01:17:54,496
I know you can do it.

861
01:17:55,312 --> 01:17:56,832
I'll be with you the whole time.
