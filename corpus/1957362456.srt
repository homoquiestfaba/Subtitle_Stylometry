00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,451
Come on man.

45
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:22,934
You know that's not the case.

Then tell me

47
00:02:26,353 --> 00:02:28,040

00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:30,376
plus their earnings
look absolutely amazing.

49
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,128
What did you expect?

50
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,546
Not to be
raped for a share.

51
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,714
You're so dramatic.

52
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:37,842
My man, look, this was
a great investment.

53
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,677
Give it about a year or two,

54
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:43,264
and I guarantee you, returns
are gonna look amazing.

55
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:46,725
Hands down, plus,
let's be honest,

56
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,209
have I ever steered you wrong?

57
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:50,896
Man, I will
give it six months.

58
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,672
That's all I'm
asking for my man.

59
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:55,942
Alright man.

60
00:02:55,966 --> 00:02:56,903
I'll talk to you later.

61
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:58,571
All right, brother.

62
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,405
You keep
pulling this shit,

63
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,447
it's always the
same shit with you.

64
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:01,282
No, no, no, no.

65
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,116
Every fucking time.

66
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,159
It's always you,
it's always you.

67
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:03,994
You bring up the same
shit all the time.

68
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:06,579
Bitch, shut the fuck up when
I'm talking to you, bitch.

69
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:07,955
Put your fucking
hands off of me.

00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,939

911, what's
your emergency?

74
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:29,268
I think I just witnessed
a domestic violence case.

75
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,728
Were you assaulted?

76
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:31,771
No, not me.

77
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,314
I'm in my car.

78
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,316
I'm going
to transfer you

79
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,983

80
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:37,192

81
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:38,236

82
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,446

your address please?

83
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:29,870

00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,442

87
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,560
Okay, sure.

00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,950

Yeah, still into
computer programing.

00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,871
Trying to make an
earnest living.

103
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:57,231
You still into that street shit?

104
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,628
They got my back, when

That cause I didn't visit
you when you in jail?

106
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,022
Moms did.

107
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,078
That's moms.

108
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,757
It's the only thing
we got left of hers.

109
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,780
I didn't even know you had it.

110
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,073
Yeah.

111
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,723
She came down to see me one day.

112
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,562
Sat across from me, and she
took it right off her neck.

113
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,441
Mama wrapped it around my hand.

114
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,200
And she said you gots
to fight for something.

115
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:51,776
Why she say that?

116
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,248
Cause I didn't feel like living.

117
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,630
I'm sorry man, I.

118
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,300

I know you had your reasons.

121
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,288
You seem like a smart dude.

122
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:20,189
Just like, why all
the dumb shit man?

123
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:24,402
Is it dumb shit because I
don't wanna follow the system?

124
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:30,241
You know, having this nice
house, nice car and job.

125
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,786
Doesn't mean you
made it little bro.

00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,849
This shit don't last forever.

But robbing banks doeS?

128
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,060
Depends on what
you do with the money.

129
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:41,562
You take peoples money.

130
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,106
No, not the people.

131
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,133
Just the ones that
tax us, take ours.

132
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,210
You a lost soul.

133
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,181
I'm just unplugged little bro.

134
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,935
I'm not selfish in
this greedy ass world.

135
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:02,982
I ain't mad at you though.

136

143
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,754

00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:30,360
You still trying to find
love on them dating apps.

145
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,404
Ain't nothing wrong
with a dating app man.

146
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:33,238
I didn't say it was.

147
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,472
Then what are you saying?

148
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,892
That you worked hard to
build up your castle.

149
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:42,230
Be nice to share it with
someone, that's all.

150
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,890

Yeah, I'm a criminal,
but who's locked up?

154
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,179
You need to make
sure you get out,

00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,264
enjoy your life a little bit.

156
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:01,850
Stop putting work in
front of everything.

157
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,728
Shit, help someone else
other than yourself for once.

158
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,170
Nigga, who you helped huh?

159
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,881

But right now, I'm

to kill each other, right?

167
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:33,813
That's not fighting.

168
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:36,677
It's stupid.

169
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,554

Okay, okay.

180
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,161
I taught you everything
you know, bro.

181
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:04,788
I see, I see mister
golden gloves.

182
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:05,623
MMA Nigga.

183
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,457
Listen, this grown man shit,

184
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,293
you don't know
nothing about that.

185
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,460
You don't know
nothing about that.

186
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:11,296
Okay, I don't know
nothing about that.

187
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,629
You don't know a
God damn thing bro.

188
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,047
Nothing.

189
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:15,906
Get out of here bro.

190
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:23,080
Nah though little bro,
the real question though,

191
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,291
what you working for here?

192
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,563
What's your end game?

193
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,982
What you mean end game?

194
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,609
Your end game, you know, like,

195
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:37,303
you got the nice house,
you got the fancy car.

196
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,807
But that's just material shit.

197
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:46,413
What about, you know,
starting a family?

198
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:49,982
Or shit, helping kids that
grew up like you and me did?

199
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,017
Nobody helped me up.

200
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,863
I had to grind for
everything I got.

201
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,282
That's why I sit where I sit.

202
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:00,993
That's true, that's true.

203
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,348
But does it feel right.

204
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:07,309
Does it feel, you rob
liquor stores and banks.

205
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,709
Does that feel right?

206
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:13,023
God works in mysterious ways.

207
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,049
There you go God, you God now?

208
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,611
You helping people out
and all that stuff,

209
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:18,835
you want some money?

210
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:23,724
Nah, I don't need
any money little bro.

211
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,853
Come on, I'm rich, in here.

212
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,917
Remember when we was kids?

213
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:32,752
Yeah.

214
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:34,294
I used to be
running the streets.

215
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:37,780
You was at home playing
video games all damn day.

216
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,217
You said that you
could hear the music

217
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:43,035
of the game even when
you wasn't playing.

218
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:48,540
I think one time you
didn't eat the whole day.

219
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,770
You got hella scared,
came running to me.

220
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,021
Big bro, make sure I don't

221
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,923
ever play a game
that long ever again.

222
00:11:56,966 --> 00:12:01,780
I'm like man, you taking that
game shit, way to serious.

223
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:02,615
Yeah.

224
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,639
You need to come take
your ass outside with me.

225
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,517
What you used to tell me though?

226
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,454
I said I'd come
outside when I win.

227
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:10,997
Exactly.

228
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,648
When you motherfucking win.

229
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:16,986
Come see me fight tonight bro.

230
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,097
Damn baby, you looking good.

231
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,869
You tell your brother yet?

232
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,538
I told him that we have
something to tell him.

233
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,189
You still didn't tell him.

234
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,877
You know he doesn't come
to these things Cyrus.

235
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:57,879
He will tonight.

236
00:12:57,903 --> 00:13:00,172
Is that so, why?

237
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,489
Because he's my brother.

238
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,066
He's not like you.

239
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:09,121
He'll be here, trust me.

240
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,686
I'm not gonna bet on it.

241
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,671
Can you just keep an eye out
for Marcus for me, please?

242
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,443
Thank you.

243
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,036
Yo, OG, I got next on this.

244
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,120
Put me down for five.

245
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:32,955
Five?

246
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,457
Yeah, yeah, I got
you young blood.

247
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,001
What you hear about the
bank on 25th street?

248
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:38,836
I hear a lot of things.

249
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,337
What you asking?

250
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,255
Is it clear to
make a withdrawal?

251
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,341
Word on the street's
that some large numbers

252
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:45,383
finna fly through there.

253
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:47,385
Early bird gets the worm.

254
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,179
Better be some big ass birds.

255
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,765
Sesame street with
all the characters.

256
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,558
You know a lot of folks
been looking at them worms,

257
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,835
but that show ain't
happening for a few days.

258
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:00,923
Is the network local?

259
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,959
Yeah.

260
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,130
So a few days.

261
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,642
Unless the chiefs
out of commission.

262
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,271
I think we can make that happen.

263
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,024
So, who you trying
to get in there with?

264
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,962
You know who.

265
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,843
Keep it down motherfuckers,
keep it down.

266
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,886
Y'all know how this shit goes.

267
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,014
No colors, no
sets, guns, knives,

268
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,641
or anything other than the
shit you was born with.

269
00:14:35,665 --> 00:14:37,477
Now we all family
up in this bitch

270
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:40,605
and we just wanna get a little
something off our chest.

271
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,107
And if you're lucky,
make a little something

272
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,734
on the side to keep
the pockets right.

273
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:47,970
The fights over if you get
knocked out, tapped out, or quit.

274
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,575
Now our next fights
gonna be a good one.

275
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,268
We got Cyrus up against Malice.

276
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,840
All right you two,
keep it clean,

277
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,216
keep your guard up at all times,

278
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,076
but most importantly, let's
have some fun with this shit.

279
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,905
Come on
baby, you got this.

280
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,859
Look at your man now!

281
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,552
That boy got a mean hook.

282
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,703
You can't keep doing
this shit Cyrus.

283
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:19,430
What?

284
00:17:19,454 --> 00:17:20,306
Stressing me out like that.

285
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,600
Come on baby, you know I was
just having a little fun.

286
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:23,685
Fun?

287
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,687
Yeah.

288
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,962
You can't continue to
move like this Cyrus.

289
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,359
Not if you're planning
on being here for us.

290
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,737
Yeah, no, no, you
right, you right.

291
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,322
I'll try to make sure the
blood stays inside my body.

292
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:37,546
All right?

293
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,436
Marcus isn't here Cyrus.

294
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,274
You need to tell him,
tell him everything.

295
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,350
Everything.

296
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,655
Let me handle
something real quick.

297
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:03,975
Masaai want to talk to you.

298
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,977
All right, I'll hit him
up when I leave here.

299
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:08,337
No, he said he want to
talk to you right now.

300
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:10,940
Really nigga?

301
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:11,942
You see I'm with my girl

302
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:13,443
and that's how you
finna pull up on me?

303
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,278
Cyrus I ain't trying
to disrespect you

304
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:16,738
cause we both on the same side,
but you know how Masaai is.

305
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,074
Said he wanted to talk to
you about that bank job.

306
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:19,908
To be honest with you,

307
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:20,826
I don't give a fuck
about none of this shit,

308
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,952
I'll smoke everyone
in this motherfucker.

309
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,537
You know how I get down.

310
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:27,624
Let's get our bundles back
up man, you know what it is.

311
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,085
All right, all right, relax
bro, it's good, it's good.

312
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,528
I'm a get my girl home,
then I'm a swing through.

313
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,179
Come on.

314
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:41,971
Don't come over
here with that shit,

315
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:42,807
what the fuck does he want?

316
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:44,724
Man, I gotta do something.

317
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:45,892
Do what?

318
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:46,726
Something.

319
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,561
Then I'm going.

320
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:49,002
Baby, I gotta go alone.

321
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:52,913
Alone?

322
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,401
Cyrus.

323
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:55,759
Baby, please.

324
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,696
Let me take care of this,

325
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,306
and I'll see you later
tonight, all right?

326
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,704
It's all right.

327
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:08,206
Promise me.

328
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,430
I promise.

329
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,918
It's gonna be all right.

330
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,142
Okay.

331
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:16,923
I'll be waiting for you.

332
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,147
Okay.

333
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,968
Got this, got this.

334
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:53,126
Looking good, looking good.

335
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,350
All right.

336
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:00,981
Game time.

337
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:04,638
Tanya?

338
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:07,182
Yes, Marcus?

339
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:10,226
Wow, I gotta say,
you look amazing.

340
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,187
Thank you.

341
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:12,729
But yeah, yeah, come in.

342
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:13,953
Please, come in.

343
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:22,197
Can I get you anything to
drink Don Perignon, Don Julio,

344
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,033
let me guess you're
a Rose kind of girl?

345
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,118
Do you tell that to every girl
that comes into your house?

346
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,995
No, I don't, I
just figured you'd

347
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,079
want something to drink.

348
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,040
Just trying to be a good host.

349
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,606
No thank you, it's all right.

350
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,668
Can I put this over here?

351
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,861
Yeah, by all means,
make yourself at home.

352
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:50,266
You have a nice place.

353
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,851
Thank you.

354
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:52,686
I was actually
thinking about putting

355
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,062
a 60 inch screen
right over there,

356
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,189
with some surround sound
for the living room

357
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,590
and the kitchen, you
know, really make it pop.

358
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,487
You didn't want
anything to drink right?

359
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,155
No, it's okay.

360
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:06,306
Honestly I just want
you to come over here.

361
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:10,801
Sorry.

362
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:19,403
You know I'm honestly,
I've had terrible luck

363
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:22,715
with all of the dating
apps that I've been on.

364
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:25,927
So I'm really excited that
we're meeting right now.

365
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:30,223
Yeah, I think I can attest
to that, absolutely.

366
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,600
I'm actually kind of
surprised that you agreed

367
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,143
to come here,
especially to my house.

368
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:36,813
Okay, honestly I wasn't
thinking about coming over,

369
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,898
but my brother lives
right down the street

370
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:41,109
so if you're with
any funny business

371
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,777
he'll be over here, quickly.

372
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,320
Promise, listen, I promise

373
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:47,740
I don't want any big
brother problems.

374
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:48,574
Of course, understood.

375
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:49,409
Scouts honor.

376
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:50,493
I am so happy that you're here,

377
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:51,661
so that's genuine, that's real.

378
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:52,496
Thank you, thank you.

379
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,038
And I'm glad you asked me.

380
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:54,873
Definitely.

381
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:57,959
So you're into
computer programming?

382
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:01,963
Yeah, yeah, program
management actually.

383
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,299
Eight plus years,
got into some things

384
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,635
like stocks, Facebook,
Amazon, Google.

385
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,179
Could I get some water actually?

386
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:11,264
Yeah.

387
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,098
I'm a little thirsty.

388
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:12,932
Yeah, totally.

389
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,156
Thank you.

390
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,198
Can I, here you go.

391
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:30,034
Thanks.

392
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:31,826
Can I get you anything else?

393
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,036
No, it's fine.

394
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,497
Okay, cool, can just so
you know I got us a 9:30

395
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:40,460
at the Lounge, great restaurant,
I'm sure you'll like.

396
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:41,684
Yeah.

397
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:46,531
Cool, so you're a
teacher, high school.

398
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,260
That's awesome,
tell me about it.

399
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:53,514
It's actually middle
school, but it's great.

400
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:56,142
Honestly I think
my favorite part

401
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:59,771
is just watching kids
develop into who they are.

402
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,357
Like whatever
information I teach them,

403
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,649
they're gonna have
to go out into

404
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:06,235
the world and
utilize that one day.

405
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:09,155
So I honestly think
it's just amazing.

406
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:12,992
Wow, wow, I can tell you're
really passionate about it,

407
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,911
is it something
you've always wanted?

408
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:18,331
Yeah, I mean, no,
I mainly wanted

409
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:22,877
to be maybe and actress
or maybe a talk show host.

410
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:26,422
But I really just wanna
empower the world.

411
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:27,646
That's interesting.

412
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:32,536
If I can ask, what changed?

413
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:37,207
Did you always want to be
in computer programing?

414
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,395
No.

415
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,563
Funny thing about
that is I actually

416
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,982
just want to be just
like my brother.

417
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:46,425
And what does he do?

418
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:54,224
Not much actually, in
his words he lives free.

419
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,162
You kind of say that
like it's a bad thing.

420
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:00,313
Living free is great.

421
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:07,654
I mean, I mean like
there's no money in it,

422
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:12,844
and I mean bums live free.

423
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:13,804
I personally feel
like you should

424
00:24:13,828 --> 00:24:15,263
just pursue the acting thing.

425
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,764
Keep your pursuing that

426
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:17,808
because everyone knows there's

427
00:24:17,832 --> 00:24:19,642
no real money in being
a teacher, right?

428
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:20,852
Excuse me?

429
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,437
I don't know what you think,

430
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:26,274
but I don't think of money and
happiness as the same thing.

431
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,967
There's a lot of lonely
and rich people at the top.

432
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,530
Starting to sound
like my brother.

433
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:33,754
Maybe he's right.

434
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:37,034
I love him to death but he says

435
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:40,020
the same thing and he has
nothing to show for it.

436
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:42,790
Okay, let me get this straight,

437
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:45,001
do you think I have
nothing to show for myself?

438
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:47,378
No, no, no, you're
twisting my words,

439
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:49,154
that's not what I
meant, I'm saying

440
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:52,049
you're a high school
teacher, that's awesome.

441
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:55,845
Thanks asshole, I'm actually
a middle school teacher.

442
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,805
And maybe you should think

443
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,016
about building
relationships with people

444
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,934
before you just decided to brag

445
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:04,312
about all the cool
crap that you have.

446
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,605
I apologize, I didn't.

447
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:06,731
Can we just, can we
just take it back?

448
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:07,816
I didn't mean that.

449
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,484
It's okay, honestly.

450
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,943
I'm sorry?

451
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:14,363
And you know, I do
empower the world.

452
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:16,407
These kids, they're the future

453
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:18,409
and I'm trying to empower them.

454
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,602
So have fun sitting at
the top by yourself.

455
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,140
Call me.

456
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:07,681
This is Lucy.

457
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:13,029
700 pounds, a big bitch.

458
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:16,732
Loyal.

459
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,370
She keeps her mouth shut.

460
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:23,748
She lets me beat her, flip her.

461
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,460
She doesn't say shit.

462
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:33,341
Never talks, complains, and
separate men from beast.

463
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:41,200
You and your crew took care
of the brinks truck last week.

464
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:42,424
How much was in it?

465
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,710
Around 75K.

466
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,193
75,000.

467
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:58,575
Tomorrow I need you and
your crew at 25th street.

468
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,458
I want you all to
understand loyalty.

469
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:13,381
You take care of me,
I take care of you.

470
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:29,814
This right here, is a
small part of loyalty.

471
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:33,475
Trust.

472
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:38,573
Getting shit done for
the bigger picture.

473
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,196
That's you.

474
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:55,799
On the opposite end of
loyalty, you've got rats.

475
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,220
And you could flush
them out with cheese.

476
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:11,022
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm
sorry, I'm sorry, please.

477
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:14,317
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

478
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:18,589
I didn't mean it,
I didn't mean it.

479
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:21,783
Please don't, please
don't, I'm sorry.

480
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,930
Nobody like rats!

481
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:29,040
I'm sorry,
please, I'm sorry.

482
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,794
I wanna go home,
I wanna go home.

483
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,648
Please.

484
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:41,487
Please, please, please.

485
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:46,158
I didn't mean it, I didn't
mean it, I didn't mean it.

486
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:48,852
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

487
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:52,689
Please, please.

488
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:57,712
He's just a kid.

489
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,089
Mice and rats do the same shit.

490
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:01,424
Big Mike got 20 years

491
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:04,409
because somebody
recognized him in a lineup.

492
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,221
That could have
been any one of us.

493
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,940
Kids make mistakes Masaai.

494
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:19,674
It shouldn't cost
them everything.

495
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:26,713
It shouldn't.

496
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:33,563
Another reason why Lucy
separates men from beast.

497
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:48,077
Men and beast.

498
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:57,452
So tomorrow?

499
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:02,842
Yeah, tomorrow.

500
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:22,254
Let's go man, check
it out, check it out.

501
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:23,881
You know I gotta make
you look bad, all right?

502
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:24,966
I'm right here man.

503
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,258
Okay, show me.

504
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:27,617
Look what I got.

505
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,933
Got 'em cooach, you ain't never
too old for a spanking baby.

506
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,851
Yeah, okay, I call that luck.

507
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,186
Yeah, okay,
I call it skill.

508
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,021
All right up top.

509
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:39,730
Okay, I call it skill man.

510
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:40,857
Let me see that skill
from right there,

511
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:42,691
pull that J, what you got?

512
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:44,300
I want the jumper.

513
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:47,071
Damn.

514
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,198
I take that up top.

515
00:30:48,222 --> 00:30:49,949
Let little bro show you
how it's done, yeah?

516
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:50,826
All right.

517
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:52,225
Check this up top.

518
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:54,119
Let's go.

519
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:54,954
Right here, I want it.

520
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:56,270
What you want, what you want?

521
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,431
Whoo!

522
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:01,252
That's how it's done.

523
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:04,380
Heavy, them W's are real
heavy right now man.

524
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:06,549
Wow, wow.

525
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:07,925
I mean you look like
you had a nice workout,

526
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,927
them L's must weigh something.

527
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:12,555
Oh my goodness, good
game bro, you got it.

528
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:13,597
Good game, good game.

529
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:14,431
You got that one.

530
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:15,655
Damn.

531
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:21,188
What's up bro,
what's on your mind?

532
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,589
You always could read me.

533
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:26,778
Honestly man I was just thinking

534
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:29,029
about what you
said the other day.

535
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,253
About what?

536
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,308
You know, if it feels right.

537
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:36,203
The cars, the money,
shit like that.

538
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:37,427
Yeah.

539
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,541
I just never thought about it.

540
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,650
You should bro,
you really should.

541
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,153
What happened to you last night?

542
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,758
I had a date.

543
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:50,759
A date?

544
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:51,595
Date.

545
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:53,512
Okay, my man, my man.

546
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:55,890
I thought you was just
trying to blow my fight off.

547
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,600
Come on bro, you know I just
don't get down with that,

548
00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:00,644
that's all, it's no disrespect,
it's just that street shit?

549
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:01,868
I can't support it.

550
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:03,856
I'm not looking for
your support bro,

551
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,883
I just wanted you to see
my last fight in the ring.

552
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,361
Last fight for real?

553
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:11,030
Yeah, my last fight bro.

554
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:12,907
I got other plan in effect.

555
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,743
Setting something up that
I want you to be apart of.

556
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,244
Honestly, so long as those plans

557
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:20,039
don't involve you going back
to jail, I'm all for it.

558
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,290
The real question is this man,

559
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,314
when are you gonna let me
hook you up with a job?

560
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,461
Man, fuck all of that man,

561
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:27,153
plus we got something
to tell you.

562
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:30,215
We as in like you and Kelly?

563
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:32,217
Boy, you know she don't
mess with me like that.

564
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:34,386
She don't know
you like that bro.

565
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:37,890
You always busy, some new
promotion or some shit.

566
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:41,894
Fam, she cussed me
out smooth last time.

567
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,187
Disrespectful.

568
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,021
Yeah, that was funny.

569
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,245
That was funny?

570
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,690
That was funny.

571
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:47,525
Okay.

572
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:51,028
Look though man, try to
get to know her for me.

573
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:53,739
Y'all got a lot more in
common then you think.

574
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:56,075
Probably why I
love both of y'all.

575
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:59,328
Yeah, look I'll try
man, I guess sometimes

576
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:01,437
I just don't see the
similarities, that's all.

577
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,650
Well I gotta get up
out of here man, but.

578
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:09,464
Let me know when
you're free though,

579
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:11,548
to see me and Kelly, all right?

580
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:12,772
I gotta go.

581
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:15,552
You gotta, you
leaving right now?

582
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:16,804
Think we could
play one last game,

583
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,931
you know, pick up, something.

584
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,155
Give you this last I.

585
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,476
I gotta meet up
with somebody bro,

586
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,978
no more L's for me today.

587
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,187
All right,

588
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:26,939
I respect it man.

589
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:27,857
I love you bro.

590
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:29,483
I love you to bro.

591
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:30,317
Take care of yourself.

592
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:31,541
Stay up man.

593
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,290
Why you park over here?

594
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:47,126
Bank like, down the street.

595
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,444
Seemed like a cool little
vantage point from here.

596
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,257
All right you know the drill.

597
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,199
We in, we out.

598
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:59,245
No bystanders, and don't
get fucking greedy.

599
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:02,683
Cyrus, I don't know
about this one G.

600
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,560
Know about it.

601
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:07,354
Come on bro, why you so nervous?

602
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,130
Acting like we ain't
done this before.

603
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,212
Fuck.

604
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,659
Killah, this look
like a set up bro.

605
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:21,785
What?

606
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:23,009
A set up nigga.

607
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,097
Fuck!

608
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:28,751
All right.

609
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:29,975
Check it out.

610
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,628
We're gonna rob this
motherfucking bank regardless.

611
00:34:32,652 --> 00:34:35,548
Even if we got to go through
that nigga, on my mama.

612
00:34:35,572 --> 00:34:37,009
Serious Cyrus?

613
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:38,233
Dead ass bro.

614
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:45,392
That's a lot of sweat.

615
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:55,193
He sent you to do it?

616
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,810
So that big bitch couldn't
do it himself, huh?

617
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:06,622
When's it supposed to happen?

618
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:12,777
After we rob this bank.

619
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:16,447
Cyrus, he knew what you were
doing with that money bro.

620
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:20,942
I'm sorry man.

621
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:25,767
The fuck you doing nigga?

622
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,771
Motherfucker!

623
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,206
Killah!

624
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:03,512
Whoa, whoa, whoa, man.

625
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:04,556
Hold on a second.

626
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,889
What you're really
trying to tell me

627
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:08,541
is you didn't even get a kiss.

628
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:10,769
Listen man, all I'm saying

629
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:11,896
is she started tripping as soon

630
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,313
as I said she should
get a different job

631
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:15,965
because, surprise,
teachers don't make much.

632
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,819
Damn man.

633
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:19,654
She should have
written you a check

634
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:21,947
for giving her financial advice.

635
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:22,823
Right?

636
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:23,741
I'm dropping gems,

637
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:25,683
and she's not even
trying to pick them up.

638
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:28,287
Man, her loss.

639
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,830
You know we need to
create our own dating app,

640
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:33,292
you know one that finds
chicks that understand us.

641
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,484
No, no, we don't need
to make an app man.

642
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,297
Come on man,
we have everything

643
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:39,715
we need in front of us,

644
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:42,033
and we know how to
operate the system.

645
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:44,553
My man.

646
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,847
Are we going to
get back to work?

647
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,600
Yeah, yeah,
we can get back to it.

648
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,560
I'm just saying,
since we're already

649
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,562
out here changing the world with

650
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,647
the way that people
interact with their phones

651
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:58,233
and computers, we
already understand

652
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:00,027
the back end development.

653
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,653
It'd be awesome to manipulate

654
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:03,447
the system and get what we want.

655
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:04,907
Yeah, but see,
that's the problem.

656
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,326
People are flesh and blood,
they're not just and app.

657
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:10,162
You can't program in it
and get what you want.

658
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,289
No, no man,
I call bullshit.

659
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:14,333
Everyone is so connected
to this system,

660
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:15,918
they probably don't
even know how to make

661
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:19,963
a decision without consulting
the social media overlords.

662
00:37:21,073 --> 00:37:22,925
People will be fine man.

663
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,343
We got a system in place that,

664
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:25,969
so long as everyone
does their position,

665
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:28,138
you know, they play it
right, they'll be fine.

666
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:30,974
Yeah man, you
know man, you got some...

667
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,393
Rodger should be
announcing who's getting

668
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,938
that new position down
South in two weeks.

669
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:36,773
Yeah, I mean, yeah, that's gonna

670
00:37:36,797 --> 00:37:38,673
be a lot of money
man, big money.

671
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,027
Hell yeah.

672
00:37:41,051 --> 00:37:42,802
Plus stock options and RSU's.

673
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:45,929
You know, I think
you're gonna get it.

674
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:48,867
Fingers crossed man.

675
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:50,911
I mean, if everything works out,

676
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,330
we could put a whole
new system in place.

677
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:55,875
Wait, wait.

678
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:58,293
What system is that?

679
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,951
What the fuck, what the fuck?

680
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:09,555
You gonna be an uncle nigga.

681
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:11,890
Not like this, what the fuck?

682
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:13,100
What the hell did you?

683
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:18,129
Who did this, what the fuck
happened, who shot you?

684
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,172
Marcus, Marcus, hey, hey.

685
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:23,902
I love you man, I
love you brother.

686
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:25,404
No, no, no, no, no,
you ain't doing this.

687
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,656
You gonna be and uncle man.

688
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,490
You gonna be an uncle.

689
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:29,659
Stop, stop, you're gonna
be a great fucking dad

690
00:38:29,683 --> 00:38:33,287
when that happens, but we gotta
keep pressure on this shit.

691
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,913
Stop talking.

692
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:36,290
You'll make it alive.

693
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:39,066
Fuck, you'll make
it alive, shit.

694
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,754
Hold on, hold, hold on.

695
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:43,840
Let me get the phone.

696
00:38:43,864 --> 00:38:47,283
Shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit.

697
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,122
Get this bag to Kelly.

698
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:55,852
I need an ambulance right now!

699
00:38:55,876 --> 00:38:59,354
I'm at 720 Kirkwood Avenue,
my brothers been shot.

700
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:02,607
Please, just come right now,
just come right now, fuck!

701
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:04,318
You're gonna
be an uncle bro,

702
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,153
you're gonna be an uncle.

703
00:39:05,177 --> 00:39:06,820
You'll be a good dad, we
won't worry about that.

704
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:09,197
Just keep pressure here,
stop talking Cyrus.

705
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:10,033
Kelly's pregnant.

706
00:39:10,057 --> 00:39:12,659
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

707
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:16,270
Pressure on the wound,
God damn it, fuck!

708
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:19,690
No, you straight, you straight.

709
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,670
No, I don't want
it, I don't want it.

710
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:32,578
You got to fight for something.

711
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,415
Fight for something.

712
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:46,749
Fuck!

713
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,159
Fuck!

714
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:22,711
I'm sorry I wasn't
there for you two.

715
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:32,030
I'm gonna find who did this.

716
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:33,281
I promise you.

717
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:57,639
Marcus, you've been pacing

718
00:40:57,663 --> 00:41:00,332
for like an hour now
man, you need to chill.

719
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:03,187
Come on man.

720
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:04,438
The cops are going
to be here any minute

721
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:05,606
and I'm sure they'll
have some kind

722
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,482
of lead or something for you.

723
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:09,067
It's been three weeks.

724
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:09,986
Last time they were here,

725
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:11,653
they took me in,
wrecked my shit,

726
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:13,321
and accused me of killing Cyrus.

727
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:15,532
They need to start
doing their jobs.

728
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:17,951
Damn!

729
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,290
Officer.

730
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,124
Marcus Sims?

731
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,041
Yes sir.

732
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:25,877
Any news of who shot my brother?

733
00:41:25,901 --> 00:41:27,485
Do you have a gun in the house?

734
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,006
What?

735
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:32,198
Do you have a gun
on the premises?

736
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:38,013
No, we went through
this already.

737
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:40,223
Do you have any
fucking thing for me?

738
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:42,291
You need to calm down Mr. Sims.

739
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,604
I was just asking
you a question.

740
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:48,339
No, who shot my brother?

741
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:51,234
Do you have anything for me?

742
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:54,070
Did you know your
brother was in a gang?

743
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:56,722
He even did some
time a few years ago.

744
00:41:59,016 --> 00:41:59,827
It's only common that something

745
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:01,828
like this was gonna
happen sooner or later.

746
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:04,396
Common, so that makes it okay?

747
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:07,417
I haven't heard shit
about this case.

748
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:08,960
Are you guys even
fucking doing your jobs?

749
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:10,861
Don't question what we do.

750
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,217
Your brother robbed a
bank, and came here.

751
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,344
And yet none of the
money was found.

752
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,638
I could you run you
in as an accomplice.

753
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:21,264
Run me as a?

754
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:22,474
You mother.

755
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:25,960
You better choose your
next words carefully boy.

756
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:34,361
Or it won't be just your brothers
blood spilt in this house.

757
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:37,447
Officer, sorry about the hassle.

758
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:39,241
My friend here is still
a little shaken up

759
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:40,766
about the loss of his brother.

760
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,143
We'll call you if
we need anything.

761
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:46,540
Is there anything else we
can help you with officer?

762
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:47,764
No.

763
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:50,568
Looks like I'm done here.

764
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,656
You got a nice
place here Marcus.

765
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:06,477
What the fuck was
that shit about.

766
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:08,395
Bro, you almost got shot,
that's what that was.

767
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,772
They basically ain't doing shit

768
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:12,023
and then they want to
put the blame on me

769
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:13,775
so they don't have to
do their fucking jobs.

770
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:14,610
It's bullshit.

771
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:16,778
Relax dude.

772
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:18,572
You always say system works.

773
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,598
No, fuck the system.

774
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:26,497
I got it.

775
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:28,039
What?

776
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:30,584
Remember how we talked
about creating that program?

777
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:33,193
If the system doesn't work,
create one for yourself.

778
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:35,548
I still don't get it.

779
00:43:35,572 --> 00:43:37,299
How did this turn
into getting chicks?

780
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:38,426
Are you trying to make
your own dating app?

781
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:41,011
No, no, no, no.

782
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:43,805
I'm gonna do what the
system's supposed to do.

783
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,265
By yourself?

784
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:46,489
Yeah.

785
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:49,033
Okay.

786
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:50,701
What's your plan?

787
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,028
First I gotta find out who was

788
00:43:57,052 --> 00:43:58,987
there during the bank robbery.

789
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:01,281
YoU just want to get the
banks camera footage?

790
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:02,890
I'm pretty sure they wore masks.

791
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:08,038
Yeah, I know my brother had
a crew that he rolls with.

792
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:09,456
Shit, maybe they'll
know something.

793
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,041
So you want to go up to a bunch

794
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:13,960
of gangsters and say,
what, who shot my brother,

795
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:15,587
so I can turn them
into the cops?

796
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:18,072
Shit dude, I don't fucking know.

797
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:21,551
I'm just hoping
maybe if I'm around

798
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:23,202
and I fucking hear something.

799
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:27,623
No offense Marcus, but
your no Neio Brown.

800
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:30,561
I don't Know if
I should slap you

801
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:32,479
or high five you for
knowing that reference.

802
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,356
High five, but the fact that

803
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,465
you said high five
proves my point.

804
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:39,625
Whatever.

805
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,490
So how do you plan

806
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,474
on getting close to
your brothers crew?

807
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:50,678
Kelly.

808
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:57,712
Thank you for coming Kelly.

809
00:44:57,736 --> 00:44:58,936
What do you want?

810
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:01,490
Can you just take a seat please?

811
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:12,418
I'm not trying to
reopen old wounds.

812
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:16,147
I need to know who Cyrus
was with during the robbery.

813
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:17,565
Is that why you brought me here?

814
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:19,609
No, that's not the case, listen.

815
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:21,444
The police think I killed Cyrus.

816
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:23,029
You're trying to
clear your name.

817
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,763
Kelly, that's not the case.

818
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:29,119
I actually thought you cared
about who killed Cyrus.

819
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:30,343
Don't, don't do that.

820
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,289
Sounds like something
you would do.

821
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:35,524
Selfish and only
thinking about yourself.

822
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:40,714
I earned that, that's fair,

823
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,048
but I still need your help.

824
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,282
Why should I help you?

825
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:47,161
Because we're family Kelly.

826
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:50,557
Because I'm trying
to be a good uncle

827
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,374
for my niece or for my nephew.

828
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:55,895
I'm trying to do everything

829
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:58,547
I'm supposed to do
for you, for myself.

830
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,540
For Cyrus.

831
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:10,716
He told you?

832
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:15,939
Yeah, he told me
before he passed.

833
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:28,952
I don't know who Cyrus was
with but I think I might,

834
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,831
I think I might know
someone who knows.

835
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:35,059
Who.

836
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,283
They call him OG.

837
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:39,105
OG huh?

838
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,232
Yeah.

839
00:46:40,256 --> 00:46:43,151
He holds these
fights, and if anybody

840
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:46,011
knows who did it, it's him.

841
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:49,908
Can you get me in?

842
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,132
I'm pretty sure I can.

843
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:55,663
But Marcus, if the guys
who shot Cyrus are there,

844
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:57,707
what makes you think they
ain't gonna do the same to you?

845
00:46:57,731 --> 00:46:59,417
No, I'm not worried about that,

846
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:01,669
they don't know I'm his brother.

847
00:47:01,693 --> 00:47:04,154
So what are you gonna do
when you find out who did it?

848
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:07,675
I don't know right now.

849
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:08,899
You don't know?

850
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:10,638
Marcus, these people don't play

851
00:47:10,662 --> 00:47:12,871
by the rules they will kill you.

852
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:16,792
So when are we leaving?

853
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:28,780
All right Marcus,
we gotta keep it cool.

854
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:30,679
Hey don't worry
about me, I got it.

855
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:34,202
See that guy over there?

856
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:35,036
Yeah.

857
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:35,913
That's OG.

858
00:47:35,937 --> 00:47:37,205
In the pink?

859
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:38,040
Yeah.

860
00:47:38,064 --> 00:47:39,982
All right, wait here.

861
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,670
You OG?

862
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:44,879
Boy what the fuck you want?

863
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:45,840
Are you OG?

864
00:47:45,864 --> 00:47:48,049
Who the fuck is asking?

865
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:48,884
Marcus.

866
00:47:48,908 --> 00:47:50,176
Who the fuck is Marcus?

867
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,053
Doesn't even matter,
I've got questions.

868
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:54,639
Well if you in my
house, it matters.

869
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:56,474
Tell you ain't a cop.

870
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:57,698
Hey Kelly.

871
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:02,772
I'm sorry OG, this is Marcus,
he's new to the house.

872
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:04,190
He doesn't know house rules yet.

873
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:05,359
What you mean house rules.

874
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:06,860
Yeah, little nigga, house rules.

875
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:09,779
This is my house, and there
are rules up in this bitch.

876
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:12,240
All right, let's try again.

877
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:13,658
Who's Marcus?

878
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:15,201
Somebody who's got questions.

879
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:16,425
To what?

880
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:17,955
I want to know about the crew

881
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:19,313
that robbed the bank on 25th.

882
00:48:20,772 --> 00:48:21,972
House rules.

883
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,586
So who you fighting?

884
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:25,420
What?

885
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:26,463
Who you fighting?

886
00:48:26,487 --> 00:48:28,298
I didn't come here
for a fucking fight.

887
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:30,216
Well you came here
looking for one,

888
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,552
plus if you want nay word on
the crew that rolled that bank,

889
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:34,161
you'll be stepping in that ring.

890
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:41,019
Listen here Marcus, in this
house people follow my rules.

891
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:42,645
And if you wanna leave
here with your face intact,

892
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:44,230
you'll be doing the same.

893
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:46,065
So, who you fighting.

894
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:47,289
Doesn't matter.

895
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:53,531
All right, we have
our winner Bear.

896
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:54,949
Now don't forget
to pay what you owe

897
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:57,076
so I don't have to come
looking for your ass.

898
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,227
And as always, house
gets ten percent.

899
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:01,081
All right motherfuckers,

900
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:02,790
we got some fresh meat
coming to the stage.

901
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:05,835
I'm pretty sure you'll all want
to give him a warm welcome.

902
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:08,236
Marcus and his opponent Barnes.

903
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:14,552
All right you two,
keep it clean,

904
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:15,803
keep your guard up at all times,

905
00:49:15,827 --> 00:49:18,664
but most importantly, let's
have some fun with this shit.

906
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,477
You're mine.

907
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:23,686
What are the rules?

908
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:24,605
Win.

909
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:42,372
Fuck him up, yeah!

910
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:36,232
Damn.

911
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:39,429
I guess we have a winner.

912
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,222
Tell me what the
fuck I need to know.

913
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:42,349
That was a hell of a fight.

914
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:44,225
Somebody makes sure
Barnes ain't dead

915
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:45,959
and get him up off my stage.

916
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:01,325
Look, I got on your
fucking little stage

917
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:02,453
and I fought all right?

918
00:51:02,477 --> 00:51:04,037
Now I want some goddamn answers.

919
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:05,455
I can tell by the way you fought

920
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:07,206
you're not a street fighter,
you're professional.

921
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,250
We don't get those down here.

922
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:11,044
I need to know.

923
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:13,504
Was your family in that
bank that got robbed?

924
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:15,089
Are you looking for revenge
against the robbers?

925
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:16,632
What I'm not seeking

926
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:19,218
is a goddamn father
figure, all right?

927
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:20,660
Who the fuck was in the crew?

928
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:24,265
Calls himself Masaai.

929
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:25,100
Masaai?

930
00:51:25,124 --> 00:51:27,810
Yeah, it was his crew
that rolled that bank.

931
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:30,229
Word on the street is they
got ambushed by another gang.

932
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:32,190
I don't know who that was,
I just know that a lot

933
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:33,816
of folks were talking
about hitting that place.

934
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:34,902
How do I talk to Masaai?

935
00:51:34,926 --> 00:51:36,736
There's no talking to Masaai,

936
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,945
you have to be in his crew
to even get close to him.

937
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:39,530
Then how do I get
in the fucking crew?

938
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:41,032
Boy, you must have a death wish.

939
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:42,450
Masaai ain't the kind of guy you

940
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:44,702
can just walk up to and
ask a couple of questions.

941
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:47,455
He'll take you out even
if you're a professional.

942
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:49,082
Who here is in his crew?

943
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,416
There's a few.

944
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,376
His right hand soilder used
to come around here a lot.

945
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,462
Who was that?

946
00:51:53,486 --> 00:51:56,905
Cyrus, he got shot up by
another crew doing that heist.

947
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,300
It's a shame too.

948
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:03,387
He was a good soldier,
shit, he was a good man.

949
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:05,515
Him and Kelly was a thing.

950
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:06,350
Did You know him?

951
00:52:06,374 --> 00:52:07,749
Anybody here from his crew?

952
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:12,313
Wait, wait, he talked about you.

953
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:13,981
This isn't your life Marcus.

954
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:14,900
If you take that step,

955
00:52:14,924 --> 00:52:16,651
it's gonna follow you for
the rest of your life.

956
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:17,968
Point out the guy.

957
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:23,431
Guy in the black raiders cap.

958
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:30,721
What's up?

959
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:34,085
You know, you're not
the usual down here.

960
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:35,309
Shit, I'm here now.

961
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:37,880
So what business
you got with OG?

962
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:39,104
That old nigga?

963
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:44,661
Look, I'm looking to join
the toughest crew around.

964
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:47,557
That's what's up,
you got hands G.

965
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:48,600
Shit the way you took out Barnes

966
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:51,435
with the elbow, shit was dope.

967
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:52,979
Appreciate it.

968
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:55,398
We could use someone like you.

969
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:56,357
Who's in your crew.

970
00:52:56,381 --> 00:52:57,358
No questions though.

971
00:52:57,382 --> 00:52:58,582
You down to ride?

972
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,279
Where we going?

973
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:02,637
Dog, are you down?

974
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,533
Yeah I'm down.

975
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:06,951
All right look, finish
kicking with your girl,

976
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:07,995
enjoy a few fights.

977
00:53:08,019 --> 00:53:09,495
I'll come grab you in a
little bit, all right?

978
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:10,329
All right.

979
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:11,553
All right, sure.

980
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:19,770
Is everything okay?

981
00:53:21,406 --> 00:53:22,606
Yeah.

982
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:28,205
I found the dude that Cyrus was
rolling with and their crew.

983
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:29,849
That guy?

984
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:31,225
Mmhm.

985
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:34,252
I'm rolling with them tonight.

986
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:38,757
Marcus, are you sure?

987
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:42,695
I'm telling you
this is not a game.

988
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:45,823
Cyrus always said I got to
step out eventually, right?

989
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:48,618
But nah, I got it.

990
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,870
You should head home, I got it.

991
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,094
Are you sure?

992
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:54,606
I'll be fine.

993
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:57,516
Marcus.

994
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:00,436
Thank you.

995
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:03,634
I'll see you later.

996
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:34,956
Get out the car,
get the fuck out.

997
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,415
Shit.

998
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:37,639
Nigga move.

999
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:52,932
Who the fuck Samson think he is?

1000
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,684
Bringing these new
niggas to the spot.

1001
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:57,002
See, that's why I had
to take care of his ass.

1002
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,647
What the fuck you doing
with Samsom anyways?

1003
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:00,482
Just looking to join

1004
00:55:00,506 --> 00:55:02,400
the toughest crew
around, that's all.

1005
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:04,527
Nigga, who are you?

1006
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:05,751
Marcus.

1007
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:24,487
What do you know about loyalty?

1008
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:28,357
Allegiance and trust.

1009
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:35,749
Trust is earned,
respect is given,

1010
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:38,126
loyalty is demonstrated.

1011
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:41,671
Betrayal of any one of those.

1012
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:46,583
You lose all three.

1013
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:50,722
So you want to be apart of this?

1014
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:53,242
Yeah.

1015
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:55,310
You're gonna have to
earn your loyalty.

1016
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:00,315
There's a liquor store
on tenth and Broadway.

1017
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:02,474
You're gonna rob it.

1018
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:07,614
At any given time, that place
holds onto about 15,000 cash.

1019
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:10,700
Bring it to me, all of it.

1020
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:14,079
You get it here, we can talk.

1021
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,630
If it's not here
within 48 hours,

1022
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:27,425
I'll start killing everybody
on this fucking phone.

1023
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:31,864
I think you understand that.

1024
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:33,088
Right Marcus?

1025
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,090
Yeah.

1026
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:43,626
Nigga, what the fuck
you still doing here?

1027
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:44,850
Bounce!

1028
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:21,288
What's up Marcus?

1029
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:22,124
Yo.

1030
00:57:22,148 --> 00:57:23,773
Damn man, what happened?

1031
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:27,545
Got into some shit man.

1032
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:29,171
Does this have anything
to do with that gang stuff

1033
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:31,048
you were talking
about the other day?

1034
00:57:31,072 --> 00:57:32,925
Honestly man, I'd rather
not talk about it at work.

1035
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:34,385
Just stop by later on tonight

1036
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:35,554
and I'll tell you all about it.

1037
00:57:35,578 --> 00:57:37,221
Call the cops?

1038
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:38,705
If only it was that simple.

1039
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,685
Marcus, you got a sec?

1040
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:43,909
Yes sir.

1041
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:47,898
What happened to your face?

1042
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:50,943
Oh, just kick boxing classes.

1043
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:53,154
Well I hope you got a few
licks in on the other guy.

1044
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:54,655
Absolutely.

1045
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:55,865
Let's talk in my office.

1046
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:57,089
Yes sir.

1047
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:21,432
You've been doing very well
with this company Marcus

1048
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:24,435
and I'd like to thank
you for your hard work.

1049
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:26,020
Thank you very much sir.

1050
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:29,797
You're a strong leader, and
you're someone I can trust.

1051
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:34,219
Very loyal to the company with
the sacrifices you've made.

1052
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:41,702
I know you are aware
we are expanding

1053
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:44,312
and we'll have a satellite
building down South.

1054
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:48,608
I would like you to run it.

1055
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:54,062
You okay with that?

1056
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:57,242
Yeah, yes sir.

1057
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:01,538
It will require some change.

1058
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:06,918
Are you okay with relocating?

1059
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:09,480
Of course.

1060
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:10,689
That's great.

1061
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:12,900
I actually want to send
you out tomorrow afternoon

1062
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:15,194
to Los Angeles to meet
with the head of marketing

1063
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:18,155
and go over some
quarterly business plans.

1064
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:19,379
Tomorrow you said?

1065
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:23,911
Yes, tomorrow.

1066
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:25,687
Is that gonna be a problem?

1067
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,415
Course not.

1068
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:29,639
Okay.

1069
00:59:30,858 --> 00:59:33,754
Marcus, I feel you will

1070
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:35,947
be the right person
for the position.

1071
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:38,676
You have no attachments.

1072
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,594
You understand how
to play the game,

1073
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:42,829
and that will get you
far in this company.

1074
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:46,198
Don't let me down.

1075
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:50,035
I won't sir.

1076
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:51,787
Excuse me.

1077
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:17,938
You good?

1078
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:21,701
Yeah, I'm good.

1079
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:28,374
Cyrus always had
bruises on his face.

1080
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:31,451
Yeah.

1081
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:36,567
Guess he has something to be
proud of me for now, right?

1082
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:38,468
He was always talking about you.

1083
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:43,532
He was always talking
about that obsession

1084
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:46,601
with that Dragon Ball Z
show y'all always watched.

1085
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:50,205
Anime, yeah.

1086
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:52,440
I'm honestly surprised
he even told you that.

1087
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,276
All the time.

1088
01:00:57,904 --> 01:00:59,947
He was a good spirit.

1089
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:03,358
Just like Goku.

1090
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:06,236
Yeah.

1091
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:12,311
So did you hear about the people

1092
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:13,961
that Cyrus was hanging out with?

1093
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:20,677
I don't think I can do it Kelly.

1094
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:24,588
Do what?

1095
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:31,580
They want me to rob a store
and I have 48 hours to do it,

1096
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:34,649
some sort of fucking initiation
or some shit like that.

1097
01:01:35,566 --> 01:01:36,766
I don't know.

1098
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:39,987
And you told them no?

1099
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:44,534
I don't think it works that way.

1100
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:51,708
They have my phone and
all my contacts in it.

1101
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:58,190
They, they said
they'd start to kill

1102
01:01:58,214 --> 01:02:00,133
everyone in my phone
if I didn't do it.

1103
01:02:06,013 --> 01:02:07,390
So what are you gonna do?

1104
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:12,886
I don't know.

1105
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:16,566
My boss, he offered
me a job in LA and.

1106
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:20,862
I honestly just
feel like taking it.

1107
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:26,191
A job?

1108
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:33,249
Is it front end, or
back end programming?

1109
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:37,503
How do you know that?

1110
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:48,347
Before I met Cyrus, I
was a web developer.

1111
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:53,019
I'm not just the girl
that cusses you out.

1112
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:57,899
What happened?

1113
01:03:02,653 --> 01:03:03,853
Well.

1114
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:09,869
I fell for Cyrus.

1115
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:17,043
And everything
that comes with it.

1116
01:03:20,254 --> 01:03:21,815
I chose family.

1117
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:39,190
They have a list of all my
contact Kelly, and my phone.

1118
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:45,863
It's okay Marcus.

1119
01:03:48,783 --> 01:03:50,117
It's not okay.

1120
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,870
You're in that
contact list Kelly.

1121
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:10,879
Look Marcus.

1122
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:15,643
Do what you need to do, okay?

1123
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:23,276
You don't owe Cyrus or
me anything, all right?

1124
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:28,739
Cyrus would be proud of you.

1125
01:04:31,742 --> 01:04:33,160
You know something?

1126
01:04:35,329 --> 01:04:40,251
I guarantee he's looking down
right now, and still proud.

1127
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:51,470
Man, this is too crazy.

1128
01:04:52,638 --> 01:04:53,838
What are you gonna do?

1129
01:04:54,807 --> 01:04:56,007
I'm thinking.

1130
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:59,997
A lot just fucking happen man.

1131
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:01,248
What about wearing a wire?

1132
01:05:01,272 --> 01:05:02,472
Fuck no.

1133
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:07,004
Shit.

1134
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:08,228
What?

1135
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:11,925
Rodger offered me the position.

1136
01:05:11,949 --> 01:05:13,886
Holy shit, that's great!

1137
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:15,110
You took it, right?

1138
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:17,181
I don't know.

1139
01:05:17,205 --> 01:05:18,807
He wants me to fly out tomorrow.

1140
01:05:18,831 --> 01:05:21,977
Well damn man,
that's your way out.

1141
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:23,061
It's not that easy man.

1142
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:24,105
Why?

1143
01:05:24,129 --> 01:05:25,397
Because they have your phone?

1144
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:26,274
You can go to the cops,

1145
01:05:26,298 --> 01:05:27,900
they can track that thing,
and you can bust them.

1146
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:30,426
It's because I still don't
know who killed Cyrus!

1147
01:05:31,385 --> 01:05:35,014
And that doesn't even
guarantees Kelly's safety.

1148
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:39,703
Look, Marcus don't take
this the wrong way man,

1149
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:42,122
but up until these
last couple weeks,

1150
01:05:42,146 --> 01:05:44,124
I barely even heard you
talk about your brother,

1151
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:46,317
and we worked together
for five years.

1152
01:05:51,405 --> 01:05:53,574
I don't talk about Cyrus

1153
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:57,785
because we took
different paths in life.

1154
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:03,125
We all got family
members like that man.

1155
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:05,336
We never knew our dad.

1156
01:06:06,545 --> 01:06:08,005
Mom was strung out on drugs.

1157
01:06:09,173 --> 01:06:10,967
In and out of
fucking foster homes.

1158
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:13,469
My head would fucking spin.

1159
01:06:15,346 --> 01:06:20,226
Cyrus, he was my fucking rock,
he was my fucking everything.

1160
01:06:23,938 --> 01:06:25,564
He used to just
keep us together,

1161
01:06:26,565 --> 01:06:28,150
he tried to keep us together.

1162
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:31,570
I'm sorry
to hear that man.

1163
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:38,244
Over time I just
learned to block it out.

1164
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:41,474
You can get real
good at blocking

1165
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:43,332
stuff out if you
try hard enough.

1166
01:06:45,918 --> 01:06:48,146
He was in jail, mom was,

1167
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:49,714
I don't know where
the fuck mom was.

1168
01:06:50,548 --> 01:06:51,748
Probably on drugs.

1169
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:55,612
And then one day, police knock

1170
01:06:55,636 --> 01:06:57,304
on my door and
tell me she's dead.

1171
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:02,560
I didn't even go to
her fucking funeral.

1172
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:07,940
I just, I didn't
even fucking care.

1173
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:11,211
I put my career in front of her,

1174
01:07:11,235 --> 01:07:12,695
in front of my fucking family.

1175
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:15,980
I can't do that again.

1176
01:07:17,825 --> 01:07:19,118
Not with Cyrus.

1177
01:07:20,786 --> 01:07:23,164
He deserves better,
he deserves more.

1178
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:28,044
Look man, I hear you, okay.

1179
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:32,757
This isn't some game, you're
into some serious shit.

1180
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:36,052
So what are you going to do?

1181
01:07:38,345 --> 01:07:40,032
I need to make
15,000 by tomorrow.

1182
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:41,256
Fuck.

1183
01:07:42,183 --> 01:07:43,160
What about LA?

1184
01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:44,384
I can't.

1185
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:48,331
If I'm gonna do this,
I gotta be all in.

1186
01:07:48,355 --> 01:07:49,875
Rodger can find somebody else.

1187
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:52,127
So you're mind's made up?

1188
01:07:52,151 --> 01:07:53,351
Yeah.

1189
01:07:54,278 --> 01:07:57,090
Well, I mean you can't
dip into your stocks

1190
01:07:57,114 --> 01:07:59,426
because it'll take at least a
week to get everything liquid.

1191
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:02,203
Yeah, I need something fast,
I need something immediate.

1192
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:04,705
Maybe you can sell your watch.

1193
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:08,626
That's not worth 15,000.

1194
01:08:15,841 --> 01:08:17,319
I got it.

1195
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:18,543
What?

1196
01:08:21,388 --> 01:08:22,588
Craigslist.

1197
01:08:23,224 --> 01:08:25,226
What are you gonna
sell on Craigslist?

1198
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:29,289
You got your phone
on you, right?

1199
01:08:29,313 --> 01:08:30,513
Yeah.

1200
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:33,858
I need you to take
some photos of my car.

1201
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:38,855
15,000.

1202
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:50,709
Good shit, take a seat.

1203
01:08:57,299 --> 01:09:01,404
So, why do you want
to be apart of this?

1204
01:09:01,428 --> 01:09:02,971
I'm looking to join a family.

1205
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:07,140
So you don't
have any family out here?

1206
01:09:08,434 --> 01:09:09,634
No.

1207
01:09:11,689 --> 01:09:14,191
Do you know why I had you
rob that liquor store?

1208
01:09:16,318 --> 01:09:17,518
Initiation.

1209
01:09:18,737 --> 01:09:19,937
Trust.

1210
01:09:21,532 --> 01:09:23,301
We do things to
preserve the trust

1211
01:09:23,325 --> 01:09:25,619
in the group, in the family.

1212
01:09:26,537 --> 01:09:29,039
Now you want to be
apart of that family?

1213
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:31,351
Yes sir.

1214
01:09:31,375 --> 01:09:32,575
Don't call me sir.

1215
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:36,212
We got some big things
getting ready to happen.

1216
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:40,800
If you're apart of
this, it's all the way.

1217
01:09:41,635 --> 01:09:43,738
No half ass shit.

1218
01:09:43,762 --> 01:09:44,962
I'm in.

1219
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:02,573
You can hold onto that for me.

1220
01:10:03,824 --> 01:10:05,024
That's good.

1221
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:12,291
Honestly, I need to make
more money, 15K isn't enough.

1222
01:10:14,251 --> 01:10:15,436
I hear you.

1223
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:19,340
Like I said, we have somethings
coming down the pipe line.

1224
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:24,178
What about like, like banks.

1225
01:10:25,346 --> 01:10:26,546
What about banks?

1226
01:10:27,598 --> 01:10:28,825
You know, anything I need

1227
01:10:28,849 --> 01:10:32,120
to look out for if I
end up robbing one?

1228
01:10:32,144 --> 01:10:33,344
For what?

1229
01:10:35,439 --> 01:10:38,692
Couple weeks ago there was
a bank heist on the news.

1230
01:10:39,985 --> 01:10:43,340
Cats who robbed
the spot got shot.

1231
01:10:43,364 --> 01:10:44,949
Samson said it was one of y'all.

1232
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:48,470
Yeah, shit happens.

1233
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:50,347
I mean like what kind of shit?

1234
01:10:50,371 --> 01:10:51,432
Street shit?

1235
01:10:51,456 --> 01:10:53,225
You worried about beef?

1236
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:56,353
No, I'm just saying,
looking out for myself.

1237
01:10:56,377 --> 01:11:01,382
The only nigga you need
to watch out for is me.

1238
01:11:06,219 --> 01:11:09,324
Samson saw you down at
the underground fights.

1239
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:10,867
Yeah.

1240
01:11:10,891 --> 01:11:12,851
What do you
think about that place?

1241
01:11:14,186 --> 01:11:15,478
It's cool, why?

1242
01:11:17,189 --> 01:11:19,692
There's a lot of money
going through that place.

1243
01:11:21,235 --> 01:11:22,435
Okay.

1244
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:24,530
It's a protected place.

1245
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:28,200
What do you mean protected?

1246
01:11:30,494 --> 01:11:32,639
Kind of a truce between gangs,

1247
01:11:32,663 --> 01:11:35,934
to keep businesses running
smoothly from city to city.

1248
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:37,686
And the cops
don't know about it?

1249
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:38,854
Know about it?

1250
01:11:38,878 --> 01:11:40,963
Shit, it was their idea.

1251
01:11:42,673 --> 01:11:44,651
Why the underground fights?

1252
01:11:44,675 --> 01:11:46,593
Because pigs find
it entertaining.

1253
01:11:48,594 --> 01:11:49,572
You met OG?

1254
01:11:49,596 --> 01:11:50,796
Yeah, I met him.

1255
01:11:52,391 --> 01:11:53,591
A dirty cop.

1256
01:11:54,727 --> 01:11:56,329
He's the reason why
two of my soldiers

1257
01:11:56,353 --> 01:11:58,105
got hit during that bank heist.

1258
01:12:00,733 --> 01:12:02,151
You telling me OG's a cop?

1259
01:12:03,443 --> 01:12:05,505
OG orchestrated a hit that

1260
01:12:05,529 --> 01:12:08,824
put my soldiers Cyrus
and Killah in harms way.

1261
01:12:10,451 --> 01:12:12,995
Them pigs been trying to
get at me for the longest.

1262
01:12:15,748 --> 01:12:17,726
Why you ain't done
nothing about it?

1263
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:18,950
OG?

1264
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:21,771
That's what you're for.

1265
01:12:21,795 --> 01:12:23,315
I'm sending you and a couple

1266
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:25,799
of soldiers over there to
take care of that place.

1267
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:32,741
No disrespect Masaai,

1268
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:34,701
but I feel like
that's a little much

1269
01:12:34,725 --> 01:12:36,160
to put on my shoulders,
don't you think?

1270
01:12:36,184 --> 01:12:38,413
This is called trust.

1271
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:40,105
Look at it as your initiation.

1272
01:12:41,815 --> 01:12:45,193
Besides, if you don't do
it, you're dead anyway.

1273
01:12:48,947 --> 01:12:50,216
Okay.

1274
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:51,718
When are we going?

1275
01:12:51,742 --> 01:12:53,136
Right now.

1276
01:13:00,541 --> 01:13:01,853
What's it gonna be?

1277
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:11,279
You got a problem with this?

1278
01:13:11,303 --> 01:13:12,503
Not at all.

1279
01:13:13,305 --> 01:13:16,225
This is for Killah, and Cyrus.

1280
01:13:17,684 --> 01:13:19,037
Our family.

1281
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:19,872
Yeah.

1282
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:31,549
Take this to the
coffee shop on 16th,

1283
01:13:31,573 --> 01:13:32,950
let them know it's from me.

1284
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:36,888
Get the fuck down!

1285
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:49,874
Get up, get up!

1286
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:52,793
Get up!

1287
01:13:54,179 --> 01:13:55,407
So you a cop?

1288
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:56,240
What?

1289
01:13:56,264 --> 01:13:57,075
So you're a cop!

1290
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:58,160
Yeah, yeah I'm a cop.

1291
01:13:58,184 --> 01:14:00,578
Look, just take the money,
I won't tell anyone.

1292
01:14:00,602 --> 01:14:02,704
So you set up the robbery huh?

1293
01:14:02,728 --> 01:14:03,928
You set up the ambush.

1294
01:14:07,067 --> 01:14:09,169
What are you talking about?

1295
01:14:09,193 --> 01:14:10,393
Marcus?

1296
01:14:10,946 --> 01:14:11,882
Marcus this isn't you.

1297
01:14:11,906 --> 01:14:13,508
There ain't no
fucking Marcus here.

1298
01:14:13,532 --> 01:14:14,509
I know it's you, I can tell

1299
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:16,869
by the way you fight,
the way you move.

1300
01:14:18,245 --> 01:14:20,390
Why'd you set up the ambush?

1301
01:14:20,414 --> 01:14:23,767
Marcus, you're a good person,
just put the gun down.

1302
01:14:23,791 --> 01:14:25,353
You got Cyrus killed.

1303
01:14:25,377 --> 01:14:26,312
I didn't get your
brother killed,

1304
01:14:26,336 --> 01:14:27,981
I swear, I didn't set up a hit.

1305
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:29,816
You know something!

1306
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:30,900
That's what you do right?

1307
01:14:30,924 --> 01:14:32,027
You know everything!

1308
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:47,667
Man, fuck that pig.

1309
01:14:47,691 --> 01:14:49,294
You good?

1310
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:50,736
Yeah, I'm good.

1311
01:14:54,448 --> 01:14:56,032
Nigga, where you get that at?

1312
01:14:57,993 --> 01:14:59,345
It's my moms.

1313
01:15:17,054 --> 01:15:18,347
That's good shit Marcus.

1314
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:24,621
Now that we got the eyes
of the streets out the way,

1315
01:15:24,645 --> 01:15:26,897
we can put the real
plan into effect.

1316
01:15:28,148 --> 01:15:29,348
Get over here.

1317
01:15:32,318 --> 01:15:36,114
This right here, is gonna
be our biggest pay day,

1318
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:38,843
I'm talking about millions.

1319
01:15:40,410 --> 01:15:41,610
Yes sir.

1320
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:46,041
I was reached by someone
high up in the cartel.

1321
01:15:46,916 --> 01:15:50,772
They got a job for
us, a little catch

1322
01:15:50,796 --> 01:15:55,800
and release with the
mayors daughter, Danielle.

1323
01:15:59,596 --> 01:16:01,181
OG almost got in the way.

1324
01:16:02,516 --> 01:16:04,452
He had his ears to the street,

1325
01:16:04,476 --> 01:16:05,995
and he was a piece of the puzzle

1326
01:16:06,019 --> 01:16:07,521
that needed to be taken out.

1327
01:16:08,689 --> 01:16:09,982
Right on Marcus.

1328
01:16:11,942 --> 01:16:14,879
A little pay back
for Cyrus and Killah.

1329
01:16:14,903 --> 01:16:17,447
Fuck Killah and Cyrus.

1330
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:24,996
Danielle is usually at the
coffee shop, on Geary and Vaness.

1331
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:26,432
She gets there
around eight o'clock

1332
01:16:26,456 --> 01:16:28,041
to meet up with her boyfriend.

1333
01:16:29,209 --> 01:16:30,979
Her dad doesn't know about it.

1334
01:16:31,003 --> 01:16:32,230
But we do.

1335
01:16:34,130 --> 01:16:38,026
Right here, gonna have two
soldiers posted up in a van.

1336
01:16:38,050 --> 01:16:40,572
Then we get out,
snatch her ass up,

1337
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:42,574
and don't worry
about wearing a mask,

1338
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:45,183
we have all the cameras
down across the block.

1339
01:16:47,311 --> 01:16:49,372
From there we take her
little ass over here,

1340
01:16:49,396 --> 01:16:53,793
we escort her to this spot
where there is a tunnel

1341
01:16:53,817 --> 01:16:56,903
to get her ass out the city,
possibly out of the country.

1342
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:02,802
That looks like,
looks like OG's spot.

1343
01:17:02,826 --> 01:17:04,620
Yeah, the cartel wants it.

1344
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:08,123
So they could have access
points throughout the city.

1345
01:17:11,126 --> 01:17:12,854
There should be some rope here.

1346
01:17:12,878 --> 01:17:14,856
Tie her ass up, and
all you gotta do

1347
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,733
is put her down that hole.

1348
01:17:16,757 --> 01:17:18,943
Once she hits the
bottom, oh she's gone.

1349
01:17:18,967 --> 01:17:20,594
Get the fuck out of here.

1350
01:17:22,763 --> 01:17:24,699
And our job is done.

1351
01:17:24,723 --> 01:17:26,826
And we'll be some
rich motherfuckers.

1352
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:28,050
Hell yeah.

1353
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:31,204
This is going out
tomorrow night.

1354
01:17:31,228 --> 01:17:32,428
Get ready.

1355
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:34,542
You ready for tomorrow?

1356
01:17:34,566 --> 01:17:36,919
Hey Masaai, can I talk
to you real quick?

1357
01:17:46,702 --> 01:17:48,538
What's on your mind?

1358
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:51,991
I killed a man today.

1359
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:56,963
That was necessary, to put
the family's plan into action.

1360
01:17:58,715 --> 01:18:01,276
Plans, What else was
part of the plan?

1361
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:02,803
Cyrus and Killah?

1362
01:18:04,513 --> 01:18:06,658
I thought that was your family.

1363
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:08,076
Yeah they were.

1364
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:10,059
It's a dirty game Marcus.

1365
01:18:11,895 --> 01:18:13,105
Somebody got to win it.

1366
01:18:15,357 --> 01:18:16,557
Pick up that money.

1367
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:18,652
Go make a girl happy.

1368
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:22,006
I'll see you tomorrow.

1369
01:18:38,797 --> 01:18:40,215
Look, man, we got to talk.

1370
01:18:46,263 --> 01:18:48,432
Still can't believe
that OG set up Cyrus.

1371
01:18:50,058 --> 01:18:51,476
He was like a father figure.

1372
01:18:56,314 --> 01:18:57,566
I killed him.

1373
01:18:58,650 --> 01:19:00,669
I killed a fucking cop.

1374
01:19:00,693 --> 01:19:02,446
A dirty cop Marcus.

1375
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:05,824
One that got Cyrus shot.

1376
01:19:09,952 --> 01:19:11,013
Are you fucking happy.

1377
01:19:11,037 --> 01:19:12,237
What?

1378
01:19:13,123 --> 01:19:14,458
Are you fucking happy?

1379
01:19:16,501 --> 01:19:19,564
We found out who killed
Cyrus, are you fucking happy?

1380
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:21,840
What the hell are you
talking about Marcus?

1381
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:28,305
I lost my fucking job, sold
my car, joined a goddamn gang!

1382
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:31,617
And I killed a fucking cop!

1383
01:19:31,641 --> 01:19:33,602
Are you fucking serious Marcus?

1384
01:19:34,478 --> 01:19:35,678
Your job?

1385
01:19:38,482 --> 01:19:43,068
I lost my fiance,
my baby's father.

1386
01:19:45,071 --> 01:19:46,271
Look at me.

1387
01:19:47,782 --> 01:19:51,202
Your brother, your blood Marcus.

1388
01:19:55,332 --> 01:19:57,083
You're worried
about your damn job.

1389
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:11,157
I just don't get it.

1390
01:20:11,181 --> 01:20:12,825
What the fuck is Cyrus
doing, why the fuck

1391
01:20:12,849 --> 01:20:15,393
wass he giving his money to
these God damn criminals?

1392
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:21,691
You really didn't
know your brother.

1393
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:28,240
He wasn't giving his
money to the gangs Marcus.

1394
01:20:39,125 --> 01:20:40,603
I wanna show you something.

1395
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:05,730
Cyrus was always talking
about how he wanted

1396
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:08,089
to give back to the kids
who really needed it.

1397
01:22:12,677 --> 01:22:14,471
He wanted you to
see this Marcus,

1398
01:22:16,514 --> 01:22:18,058
he wanted you to be apart of it.

1399
01:22:25,273 --> 01:22:26,483
I never knew.

1400
01:22:38,202 --> 01:22:40,139
Hey Kelly, how you doing?

1401
01:22:40,163 --> 01:22:40,972
Teisha.

1402
01:22:40,996 --> 01:22:41,808
It is good to see you.

1403
01:22:41,832 --> 01:22:43,166
It's good to see you to.

1404
01:22:45,043 --> 01:22:46,561
This is Marcus.

1405
01:22:46,585 --> 01:22:48,773
Oh, hi Marcus, nice
to finally meet you.

1406
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:51,150
I'm so sorry for your loss.

1407
01:22:51,174 --> 01:22:52,776
Come on in.

1408
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,000
Thank you Teisha.

1409
01:22:55,719 --> 01:22:57,281
I wanted to bring
Marcus over here

1410
01:22:57,305 --> 01:22:59,492
and show him how
much this foundation

1411
01:22:59,516 --> 01:23:01,101
has helped these kids lives.

1412
01:23:02,143 --> 01:23:04,454
Yeah, this is something
like a foster care,

1413
01:23:04,478 --> 01:23:06,749
but our main focus is to keep

1414
01:23:06,773 --> 01:23:09,317
brothers and sisters
together on this journey.

1415
01:23:10,151 --> 01:23:11,351
A foster home.

1416
01:23:11,945 --> 01:23:15,091
There's a lot of families
that fall on hard luck,

1417
01:23:15,115 --> 01:23:18,076
and the government,
they try to help but.

1418
01:23:19,411 --> 01:23:23,099
Sometimes they take away
the most important thing

1419
01:23:23,123 --> 01:23:25,791
that a kid has after
they lost their parents.

1420
01:23:26,918 --> 01:23:28,294
They take away their blood.

1421
01:23:58,825 --> 01:24:02,221
Thank you for
sharing that with me.

1422
01:24:02,245 --> 01:24:03,580
No, thank you.

1423
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:12,379
I didn't know
anything about him.

1424
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:15,443
It's okay Marcus.

1425
01:24:15,467 --> 01:24:18,863
No, no, I didn't know anything.

1426
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:20,087
Marcus.

1427
01:24:21,347 --> 01:24:22,849
I should have been
there for him.

1428
01:24:24,059 --> 01:24:28,396
No, Marcus, Cyrus
was getting paranoid.

1429
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:33,544
Paranoid about what?

1430
01:24:33,568 --> 01:24:36,672
I don't know, he
just kept coming home

1431
01:24:36,696 --> 01:24:39,050
and saying that he wasn't loyal,

1432
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:43,012
and I don't know, it just kept,
it all caught up with him.

1433
01:24:43,036 --> 01:24:43,846
Wait, wait, wait.

1434
01:24:43,870 --> 01:24:45,070
Loyal about what though?

1435
01:24:46,289 --> 01:24:48,809
I don't know, he
kept saying that

1436
01:24:48,833 --> 01:24:51,686
his loyalty was being
questioned by the group.

1437
01:24:56,257 --> 01:24:57,457
Marcus?

1438
01:24:59,969 --> 01:25:01,906
What's going on.

1439
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:03,115
Look, what I'm gonna tell
you right now is gonna be

1440
01:25:03,139 --> 01:25:05,868
very important, so I need
you to listen to me, okay?

1441
01:25:05,892 --> 01:25:06,911
Call the police in two hours,

1442
01:25:06,935 --> 01:25:08,746
tell them I'll be
at this address,

1443
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:10,372
tell them there's guns, drugs,

1444
01:25:10,396 --> 01:25:12,190
and the gang leader
Masaai, okay?

1445
01:25:13,650 --> 01:25:14,850
I need your keys.

1446
01:25:16,528 --> 01:25:18,487
Kelly please, I need your keys.

1447
01:25:20,865 --> 01:25:22,065
Marcus.

1448
01:25:22,951 --> 01:25:24,096
Please.

1449
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:32,603
Fine.

1450
01:25:32,627 --> 01:25:33,827
What are you gonna do?

1451
01:25:35,588 --> 01:25:37,483
I'm gonna make sure
he stays there.

1452
01:26:00,822 --> 01:26:02,022
Marcus Sims.

1453
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:06,702
There's no one in here but us.

1454
01:26:08,913 --> 01:26:10,915
So you got
Cyrus killed, huh?

1455
01:26:12,083 --> 01:26:13,727
Your brother.

1456
01:26:13,751 --> 01:26:16,188
I had a couple of
guys look into you

1457
01:26:16,212 --> 01:26:18,505
because they saw you
wearing Cyrus's chain.

1458
01:26:20,633 --> 01:26:23,969
A white collar nigga
playing gangster.

1459
01:26:25,263 --> 01:26:27,365
Why'd you do it Masaai?

1460
01:26:27,389 --> 01:26:29,058
All I have is loyalty.

1461
01:26:30,393 --> 01:26:32,437
I found out he was
keeping money from me.

1462
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:37,567
So your own people
ain't even safe, huh?

1463
01:26:43,531 --> 01:26:44,883
Like I told you,

1464
01:26:44,907 --> 01:26:48,202
the only nigga you need
to worry about is me.

1465
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:52,641
That shit won't work.

1466
01:26:56,794 --> 01:26:58,647
You uncle Tom ass nigga.

1467
01:27:02,675 --> 01:27:04,445
Oh you want to feel the struggle

1468
01:28:17,041 --> 01:28:18,894
Family is nothing
without loyalty!

1469
01:29:01,878 --> 01:29:04,981
Fuck you, you're
nothing like us.

1470
01:29:05,005 --> 01:29:07,776
You're a pussy, just
like your brother.

1471
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:10,445
They're coming for you.

1472
01:29:10,469 --> 01:29:12,740
Just fucking kill me.

1473
01:29:12,764 --> 01:29:13,825
Fucking kill me.

1474
01:29:17,602 --> 01:29:18,936
Fucking kill me!

1475
01:29:20,103 --> 01:29:23,733
You're right Masaai,
I'm nothing like you.

1476
01:29:27,445 --> 01:29:28,645
Kill me!

1477
01:29:33,618 --> 01:29:35,763
I won't give you
the satisfaction.

1478
01:29:35,787 --> 01:29:37,621
Of being with my brother.

1479
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:42,062
No.

1480
01:31:40,536 --> 01:31:42,514
911, what's
your emergency?

1481
01:31:42,538 --> 01:31:43,348
Yeah, the
mayors daughter,

1482
01:31:43,372 --> 01:31:44,975
she's just been kidnapped.

1483
01:31:44,999 --> 01:31:47,102
She's been thrown in
the back of a van.

1484
01:31:47,126 --> 01:31:49,146
What's
your location sir?

1485
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:51,773
I'm at the corner
of Geary and Vaness,

1486
01:31:51,797 --> 01:31:53,442
in front of a coffee shop.

1487
01:31:53,466 --> 01:31:55,319
Can you identify who
grabbed the mayors daughter?

1488
01:31:55,343 --> 01:31:57,445
No, I don't know
who grabbed her.

1489
01:31:57,469 --> 01:31:58,405
What about
a license plate,

1490
01:31:58,429 --> 01:31:59,240
did you happen to see that?

1491
01:31:59,264 --> 01:32:01,283
I didn't see the, I didn't see

1492
01:32:01,307 --> 01:32:02,910
the license plate
number, all right?

1493
01:32:02,934 --> 01:32:05,537
Okay sir, I'm gonna
need you to calm down.

1494
01:32:05,561 --> 01:32:07,498
But I do have an idea
where's she's going.

1495
01:32:07,522 --> 01:32:09,499
How do you know
this information sir?

1496
01:32:09,523 --> 01:32:11,001
Just listen!

1497
01:32:11,025 --> 01:32:12,211
All right?

1498
01:32:12,235 --> 01:32:14,296
Okay, if I can
have you calm down sir,

1499
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:15,672
what's your name?

1500
01:32:15,696 --> 01:32:17,925
There's a warehouse
on the docks.

1501
01:32:17,949 --> 01:32:19,343
And where is this sir?

1502
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:20,178
Seventh and Green.

1503
01:32:20,202 --> 01:32:21,553
And to make sure
this isn't a prank call

1504
01:32:21,577 --> 01:32:24,413
and we don't send units out
there, what's your name?

1505
01:32:25,706 --> 01:32:27,184
Just show up.

1506
01:32:39,262 --> 01:32:40,596
Come on, move.

1507
01:32:56,237 --> 01:32:58,948
You don't want to
damage the merchandise.

1508
01:33:06,539 --> 01:33:07,739
You're so pretty.

1509
01:33:08,874 --> 01:33:11,502
You're going to be very popular.

1510
01:36:32,161 --> 01:36:33,555
Get down, get down!

1511
01:37:42,690 --> 01:37:43,709
I want to start off

1512
01:37:43,733 --> 01:37:46,235
by saying thank
you for everything.

1513
01:37:48,237 --> 01:37:49,089
Thank you for letting me see

1514
01:37:49,113 --> 01:37:51,740
my brother for
who he really was.

1515
01:37:53,784 --> 01:37:54,984
Who he became.

1516
01:37:56,452 --> 01:37:59,039
It's a shame that I didn't
see it until he was gone.

1517
01:38:01,250 --> 01:38:03,002
I finally understand
what he meant.

1518
01:38:04,460 --> 01:38:05,796
I'm not doing this for me.

1519
01:38:08,090 --> 01:38:09,776
I felt like I didn't
have any family,

1520
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:13,012
that I was taking
on this world alone.

1521
01:38:15,014 --> 01:38:18,684
Even when I was blinded,
Cyrus was there.

1522
01:38:20,311 --> 01:38:22,747
I can never give my niece
or nephew their father

1523
01:38:22,771 --> 01:38:26,209
but what I can give
them is something

1524
01:38:26,233 --> 01:38:31,237
me and Cyrus never
had, a better start.

1525
01:38:49,505 --> 01:38:50,275
In the envelope on the table

1526
01:38:50,299 --> 01:38:51,633
I signed everything over to you.

1527
01:38:57,514 --> 01:39:01,018
I don't know what the
future holds for me.

1528
01:39:02,311 --> 01:39:05,147
But I know it
finally feels right.
