00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:23,008
They've done cave rescues
all over the world.

365
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:24,951
Our names must be
on some list somewhere.

366
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:26,327
I told the governor,

367
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:28,013
- "These are the men you need."
- [John] Look, guys,

368
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:29,181
the children
are still in the cave, yeah?

369
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:30,265
- Look, John...
- Yeah, but...

370
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,392
- [Vern] Just a sec.
- The clock is ticking.

371
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:32,810
[Vern] Look, lads,
it's just that they don't want

372
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:34,168
foreigners dying in the cave.

373
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:35,253
It's not a good look.

374
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:36,879
We won't die.

375
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:38,840
I have zero interest in dying.

376
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:40,008
How about you, John?

377
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:40,967
Yeah, same.

378
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,650
[Arnont] If the governor
sent for them...

379
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:44,929
You can dive.

380
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,431
Thank you.

381
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,059
[indistinct chatter]

382
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:51,743
[Vern] Lads, first
it's gonna be a series

383
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,271
of small cascades,

384
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:54,856
followed by
a deeper wading section

385
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:56,065
before your first dive.

386
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:57,650
Your best chance is a large cave

387
00:21:57,734 --> 00:21:59,068
about two kilometers in.

388
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:04,866

[in Thai]

400
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:26,645
I'll follow. I need a few
more minutes to fix this pump.

[pump misfiring]

402

[urgent chatter]

403
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:41,462
The water level is getting high.

404
00:23:41,546 --> 00:23:42,797
It's almost running.

Shit!

414
00:26:02,812 --> 00:26:04,292
[John] That's it.
We better head back.

Wait, wait. You speak English?

419
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:36,846
I fix pump, but water come fast.

420
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:37,930
[Rick] Bloody hell.

421
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:40,683
We'll have to dive him out.

422
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,101
- Can you swim?
- Yes.

423
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:43,311
Give me your mask.

424
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:44,812
I'll take him out and come back.

425
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:45,895
[John] Okay.

426
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,148
Right.

427
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:49,233
You breathe through this.

428
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:52,445
Breathe. Okay?

429
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:53,528
Mask.

430
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:58,534
Face in the water.
Just try it.

431
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,620
We swim together. All right?

432
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:03,956
Here we go.

438

Help!

[snorkel hisses]

444
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:37,091
That was exciting.

445
00:28:38,092 --> 00:28:39,552
Not in a good way.

446
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:40,803
Did he make it out okay?

447
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,054
Yeah.

448
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,906
[in English] Hello.

449
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,992
I'm the governor
of this province.

450
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,618
Grateful for your help.

451
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,456
[Rick] We went as far
as we could.

452
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:10,124
Didn't find the boys.

453
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:11,459
How far did you get?

454
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:12,710
T-junction.

455
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:13,794
[in Thai]

456
00:29:13,878 --> 00:29:16,881
The T-junction is the same
location my team got to.

457
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:19,383
That's as far
as they laid their line.

458
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:22,386
I sent for them on good advice.

459
00:29:23,554 --> 00:29:25,681
I'm pursuing every avenue
open to me.

460
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:28,434
Yes, Governor.

461
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:31,729
I'll let you know when
the rescue operation can be resumed.

462
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:38,874
[Narongsak in English]
I must ask, please,

463
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:41,697
do not go in the cave again
without my permission.

464
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:48,662
Just a sec, boys.
Sir?

465
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:58,547
[John] What was all that about?

466
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:00,841
Well, in theory,
the governor's in charge,

467
00:30:00,925 --> 00:30:03,177
but Captain Arnont's
the Navy chief on the ground

468
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,262
and he doesn't take orders
from civilians.

469
00:30:05,346 --> 00:30:07,681
Plus, the rumor is,
the governor's been sacked.

470
00:30:07,765 --> 00:30:09,326
This was supposed to have been
his last week here,

471
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,060
and now he's been ordered
to stay on.

472
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:13,479
Just in case
they need a fall guy.

473
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:16,690
[Rick] Hmm. Hey, Vern.
What's all that?

474
00:30:16,774 --> 00:30:19,193
[Vern] That's a shrine
to Princess Nang Non,

475
00:30:19,276 --> 00:30:21,278
the Sleeping Princess.

476
00:30:21,362 --> 00:30:23,155
[Bas] This is her mountain.

477
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:24,949
Nang Non mountain.

478
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:26,760
[Vern] They say when you
see it from a distance,

479
00:30:26,784 --> 00:30:29,912
it looks like
a sleeping princess.

480
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:32,498
[Bas] They say that her tears
trapped the boys.

481
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:34,959
The Sleeping Princess is angry.

482
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:36,126
Angry?

483
00:30:36,794 --> 00:30:38,546
What's she angry about?

484
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:40,130
I don't know.

485
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:42,007
It's just what
the local people say.

[reporter speaking Thai on TV]

487
00:30:54,645 --> 00:30:57,773
Life threatening infections
are a concern.

488
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:01,735
We need to remember that
every breath they take

489
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:05,030
increases carbon dioxide levels.

490
00:31:05,114 --> 00:31:08,617
As oxygen decreases,
physical exertion becomes more taxing.

491
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,792
Right here, that's their tent.

492

Hey.

00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:31,265

So you broke free?

[Sam an chuckles]

502
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,062

Hey team, this is Sam an.

00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:42,484
Saman's one of us.
He served under me for ten years.

Can I talk with you please?

00:31:59,043 --> 00:32:00,043
Sir,

516
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:02,463
my boy is in the cave

517
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:05,633
and now it's flooding.

518
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:07,676
I don't know if my son
is alive or dead.

519

All I ask from you, sir,

520
00:32:12,348 --> 00:32:15,517
is to bring me his body.

523
00:32:30,324 --> 00:32:31,617
[in English]
Excuse me, governor?

524
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,577
Major Charlie Hodges.
US Air Force, Okinawa.

525
00:32:33,661 --> 00:32:34,828
This is Captain Olivia Taft.

526

Governor.

527
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:38,243
[Charlie] We're the nearest
Special Operations Squad.

528
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,459
But we have medics,
comms, logistics experts.

529
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:41,835
We'll do whatever we can
to help.

530
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,504
Thank you.

531
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:45,464
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

532
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:47,549
[Narongsak] Thank you.
Everyone!

533
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:48,926
We're going to get started now.

534
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:52,680
So, we think that the boys
were heading for here.

535
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:53,889
They call it Pattaya Beach.

536
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:58,143
With the high water level
and the low visibility,

537
00:32:59,228 --> 00:33:01,188
and the difficulty
of the cave itself,

538
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:06,193
our divers were not able
to reach them.

539
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:08,904
So, now, the question is,

540
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:11,740
when do we go back in?

541
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,451
And who is going in?

[murmuring]

543
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:20,124
We need the rain to stop,
and let the pumps do the work.

544
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:21,834
And then, we go in.

545
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:24,044

Of course.

577

There's a network
of mountain streams

578

That's what's creating
the strong currents.

580
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:13,821
If we find a way to divert these streams,
the water level will drop.

581
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:16,740
I thought that's why we're pumping water
out of the cave below.

No, sir.
Those pumps are useless.

Rescuers are attempting to find
alternative ways to reach the cave.

909
00:56:07,406 --> 00:56:09,742

will never survive

910
00:56:09,825 --> 00:56:12,328

and flooding.

914
00:56:28,344 --> 00:56:30,262
you made it to the T-junction?

915
00:56:30,346 --> 00:56:31,514
I did, yeah.

916
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:36,268
Do you want a briefing
on the rest of the way?

917
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:39,730
Yeah, please. Come in.

918
00:56:44,819 --> 00:56:46,362
[Rick] You made it here.

919
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:50,741
You have a 250-meter dive here,

920
00:56:50,825 --> 00:56:52,243
with a narrow rift,

921
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:55,371
barely shoulder-wide,
to Chamber 7.

922
00:56:55,454 --> 00:56:57,081
Then you have to de-kit

923
00:56:57,164 --> 00:57:00,584
and carry your gear
over a long rock shelf

924
00:57:00,668 --> 00:57:02,128
to get to Pattaya Beach.

925
00:57:02,211 --> 00:57:03,337
Then comes a tough dive.

926
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:07,675
It's a long, shallow tunnel,

927
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:11,971
bit more twisty than this,
350 meters.

928
00:57:12,054 --> 00:57:15,099
No visibility. Pulling against
very strong currents.

929
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:16,892
No headroom at all.

930
00:57:16,976 --> 00:57:19,687
And there's undercuts
on all the bends.

931
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:21,147
They're very, very dangerous.

932
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:24,483
So, you must always keep
to the wider side of the line,

933
00:57:24,567 --> 00:57:26,694
or you'll get trapped.

934
00:57:26,777 --> 00:57:29,238
At the end of that,
you'll reach the boys.

935
00:57:30,573 --> 00:57:33,284
[John] And it's
a very physical dive.

936
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:35,202
So, try and save
two-thirds of your air

937
00:57:35,286 --> 00:57:36,429
going in,
so you can make it back.

938
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:37,955
We will get there.

939
00:57:38,038 --> 00:57:38,873

1091
01:07:46,646 --> 01:07:48,815

Okay.

01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:08,460
So, did I pass?

1099
01:08:08,543 --> 01:08:10,420
- What?
- Did I pass?

1100
01:08:10,504 --> 01:08:12,464
- No, you were terrible.

How the hell do you think
we're gonna get those kids out?

It's just, gettin' the permits

[Rick] You wanna see the cave?

1121
01:08:55,924 --> 01:08:57,300
Yeah.
That's what I'm here for.

Oh, imagine what they're
going through.

1126
01:09:05,267 --> 01:09:07,602
We managed to bring some

[Harry] That's it.

1131
01:09:20,949 --> 01:09:22,868
So, who else answered the call?

1132
01:09:22,951 --> 01:09:24,244
Who else you got here?

1133
01:09:24,327 --> 01:09:26,180

I'm not in the same league
as you guys, but...

1138
01:09:38,592 --> 01:09:40,969
But you've got a skill

1139
01:09:41,052 --> 01:09:42,512

Rick, it's insane.

1150
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:07,871
It's unethical. It's...

1151
01:10:07,954 --> 01:10:09,706
It's illegal, all right?

1152
01:10:09,789 --> 01:10:11,499
And anyway,
it just wouldn't work.

1153
01:10:11,583 --> 01:10:13,352
Well, you don't know that.
It's never been done before.

1154
01:10:13,376 --> 01:10:14,628
No, you'll kill 'em.

1155
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:18,506
They're gonna die anyway.

1156
01:10:21,635 --> 01:10:22,844

of everything.

Doctor Harry.

to kill kids, Rick.

I came here
to help you save 'em.

1163
01:10:41,488 --> 01:10:42,948
- Okay.
- Yeah?

1164
01:10:43,031 --> 01:10:44,491
Yeah, you're right.
You're right.

I mean, we're...
We're just desperate.

1166

- It's a bad idea.
- Yeah.

1167
01:10:48,036 --> 01:10:50,163
- It's the only idea.
- Leave it, Rick.

1168
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:51,498
Yeah. Harry's the expert.

1169
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:53,581
If he says it can't be done,
then it can't be done.

1170
01:10:56,836 --> 01:10:58,338
Anything else I can do,

1171
01:10:58,421 --> 01:10:59,965
- I will do.
- Sure.

1172
01:11:00,048 --> 01:11:01,967
Obviously, I took an oath,
and I...

1173
01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:03,093
Understood.

1174
01:11:03,176 --> 01:11:04,719
- We'll just keep exploring.
- Yeah?

1175
01:11:04,803 --> 01:11:06,003
- Yeah. Keep exploring.
- Yeah.

1176
01:11:06,054 --> 01:11:07,531
It's good to have you
on board, Harry.

1177
01:11:07,555 --> 01:11:08,555
Okay.

01:19:10,413 --> 01:19:13,416
one or two or three,
if we're lucky,

1261
01:19:13,499 --> 01:19:15,501
of those kids
might just make it through.

1262
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:20,256
But you're talking about
a five-hour dive.

1263
01:19:20,339 --> 01:19:21,799
- Right.
- That means that

1264
01:19:21,883 --> 01:19:24,927
they're gonna have to have
top-up shots along the way.

1265
01:19:25,011 --> 01:19:26,846
And then you got
the saliva problem.

1266
01:19:26,929 --> 01:19:28,264
Even if the masks hold,

1267
01:19:28,347 --> 01:19:29,390
there's a very good chance

1268
01:19:29,474 --> 01:19:30,659
they're gonna choke, all right?

1269
01:19:30,683 --> 01:19:32,351
The whole thing is insane.

1270
01:19:32,435 --> 01:19:34,061
I don't even know
why I'm saying it.

1271
01:19:34,145 --> 01:19:35,771
'Cause a man's already died.

1272
01:19:37,982 --> 01:19:39,982
- Yeah.
- And those kids don't have much time left.

1273
01:19:41,277 --> 01:19:42,278
Harry.

1274
01:19:42,945 --> 01:19:44,322
We do nothing,

1275
01:19:44,405 --> 01:19:45,965
we'll be bringin' 'em
out dead for sure.

1276
01:19:47,825 --> 01:19:49,585
But if they die
while we're bringin' 'em out,

1277
01:19:50,536 --> 01:19:51,954
at least we will have tried.

1278
01:19:55,917 --> 01:19:56,917
[Harry scoffs]

1279
01:20:07,386 --> 01:20:08,386
Sedated?

1280
01:20:09,514 --> 01:20:10,640
How sedated?

1281
01:20:14,352 --> 01:20:17,188
Fully. Fully unconscious.

1282
01:20:17,271 --> 01:20:19,232
It's the only way
we can dive them out.

1283
01:20:19,315 --> 01:20:20,483
[Rick] Mmm.

1284
01:20:20,566 --> 01:20:22,151
They have to be inert.

1285
01:20:22,235 --> 01:20:23,694
Completely still.

1286
01:20:23,778 --> 01:20:26,405
We'll take them out
like packages.

1287
01:20:28,574 --> 01:20:31,035
And you are an anesthetist?

1288
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:33,621
Yes. Yes, I am.

1289
01:20:34,956 --> 01:20:35,790
Preeya.

1290
01:20:35,873 --> 01:20:36,707
[in Thai]

1291
01:20:36,791 --> 01:20:37,917
Don't write this down.

1292
01:20:39,418 --> 01:20:41,379
[in English]
How safe is this procedure?

1293
01:20:46,634 --> 01:20:48,261
[scoffing]

1294
01:20:48,344 --> 01:20:51,180
I just can't answer that.

1295
01:20:51,264 --> 01:20:52,640
Because I've never
done it before.

1296
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:56,644
As far as I know,
nobody ever has.

1297
01:20:59,564 --> 01:21:00,565
In...

1298
01:21:02,108 --> 01:21:04,610
In theory, it could work.

1299
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:11,450
But we're talking about
administering anesthetics

1300
01:21:11,534 --> 01:21:15,246
under conditions where we just
can't monitor the effect.

1301
01:21:16,914 --> 01:21:19,834
So, too much

1302
01:21:19,917 --> 01:21:21,961
and respiration
can just shut down.

1303
01:21:23,254 --> 01:21:25,715
And too little and, uh...
[blows]

1304
01:21:27,842 --> 01:21:29,677
If they wake up under water,

1305
01:21:31,846 --> 01:21:33,389
they can drown.

1306
01:21:35,516 --> 01:21:36,642
[clears throat]

1307
01:21:38,269 --> 01:21:41,606
So, you are expecting,
uh, casualties?

1308
01:21:42,315 --> 01:21:44,859
Yes. I expect casualties.

1309
01:21:46,694 --> 01:21:48,694
- [cameras clicking]
- [reporter 1] Minister, here!

1310
01:21:50,031 --> 01:21:51,031
[reporter 2] Governor!

1311
01:21:52,617 --> 01:21:54,410
[Bas] The minister is coming.

1312
01:21:57,121 --> 01:21:59,081
[reporter 3] Governor,
over here! Sir!

1313
01:22:09,133 --> 01:22:10,217
[in Thai]

1314
01:22:10,301 --> 01:22:13,679
The operation may now proceed.

1315
01:22:17,892 --> 01:22:19,060
Yes, Minister.

1316
01:22:26,901 --> 01:22:28,694
[in English]
May you be successful.

1317
01:22:37,662 --> 01:22:40,581
No one must know about the...

1318
01:22:41,874 --> 01:22:43,334
the method you propose.

1319
01:22:44,752 --> 01:22:46,587
Not even the parents.

1320
01:22:49,674 --> 01:22:50,675
Do your best.

1321
01:22:52,218 --> 01:22:53,344
And if we fail,

1322
01:22:55,012 --> 01:22:57,765
the failure is mine alone.

1323
01:23:02,937 --> 01:23:03,937
Okay.

1324
01:23:04,563 --> 01:23:05,564

[Thanet speaking Thai]

1327
01:23:13,239 --> 01:23:16,951
Your volunteering
and effort is critical.

1328
01:23:17,034 --> 01:23:20,663
The faster the waterways can be diverted
before the monsoons return,

1329
01:23:20,746 --> 01:23:23,165
the more time
we can buy for the boys.

1330
01:23:23,249 --> 01:23:26,127
They're telling us
the dams are helping.

1331
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:28,713
It makes it possible for the
divers to reach the boys.

1332
01:23:28,796 --> 01:23:30,923
But if we don't build enough,

1333
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:34,301
when the monsoons arrive,
the boys will drown.

1334

they're all being sent away.

1344

Don't believe in luck.

1357
01:24:48,042 --> 01:24:49,882
Just take it, take it.
She's watching, come on.

1358
01:24:59,887 --> 01:25:03,182
All right.
We'll be having to give them

1359
01:25:03,265 --> 01:25:06,268
repeat hits of Ketamine
along the way.

1360
01:25:07,645 --> 01:25:08,645

1361
01:25:09,230 --> 01:25:10,230
Yeah.

1362
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:13,901
Now, the injection goes
through the wet suit,

1363
01:25:13,984 --> 01:25:16,237
into the thigh muscle here
or here.

1364
01:25:17,446 --> 01:25:20,366
Each dose should last
about 30 minutes.

1365
01:25:20,449 --> 01:25:23,244
Keep a little bit of, see,
space on the needle there.

Push in and out.

1367

It's quite simple.

1368

gets through the long dive,

01:53:15,998 --> 01:53:19,710
The monsoon season
is closing in fast.

[volunteer exclaims in Thai]

1793
01:53:29,929 --> 01:53:31,289

Hell yeah, man!

1794
01:53:31,347 --> 01:53:32,932

Flown in from Bangkok.

1802
01:53:52,868 --> 01:53:53,868
All right.

1803
01:53:55,037 --> 01:53:56,037
Nah.

1804
01:53:57,581 --> 01:53:58,666
Ah!

1805
01:54:03,254 --> 01:54:05,130
- [Harry clears throat]
- Think it'll fit?

1806
01:54:05,214 --> 01:54:06,757
Yeah, it better do.
It is smaller.

1807
01:54:07,424 --> 01:54:08,424
[Rick] Have a seat, Bas.

1808
01:54:09,260 --> 01:54:10,803

Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

1815
01:55:05,566 --> 01:55:06,886
You wanna
keep it like that, okay?

1816
01:55:08,902 --> 01:55:10,654
[rain pattering on roof]

1817
01:55:14,283 --> 01:55:16,285
That's a lot of water.

1818

01:55:35,638 --> 01:55:37,556
[indistinct chatter]

1820
01:55:46,523 --> 01:55:48,233
Water level's
gonna be rising in there.

1821
01:55:48,317 --> 01:55:49,860
For sure.

1822
01:55:49,943 --> 01:55:51,129
We'll still make it through,
though, right?

1823
01:55:51,153 --> 01:55:52,488
Don't know.

1824
01:55:52,571 --> 01:55:54,782
We dive and we find out.

1825
01:55:54,865 --> 01:55:56,617
It depends, Jason.

1826
01:55:56,700 --> 01:55:58,678
Rick and I have been in there
when it's fully flooded.

1827
01:55:58,702 --> 01:56:00,204
It's a beast.

1828
01:56:00,287 --> 01:56:03,499
Come on.
We're not stopping now.

1829
01:56:03,582 --> 01:56:06,251
You die in a cave
if you want to, Jason.

1830
01:56:06,335 --> 01:56:08,671
If I'm not sure of coming out,
I'm not going in.

1833
01:56:27,189 --> 01:56:28,107
Hurry.

1834
01:56:28,190 --> 01:56:30,693
It won't stop raining.
We need more sandbags.

1835
01:56:30,776 --> 01:56:34,405
Everyone, there are three sinkholes
in the rocks to the east.

1836
01:56:36,281 --> 01:56:37,783
[busy chatter]

1837
01:57:19,992 --> 01:57:22,703
Okay. We can make it.

1838
01:57:22,786 --> 01:57:24,830
- We better move fast.
- Okay, lads.

1839
01:57:28,625 --> 01:57:29,793
[Vern] All right, Harry.

1840

[in English]
Everyone leaves today.

1843
01:57:49,605 --> 01:57:51,005
[John] We do this
as fast as we can.

1844
01:57:52,649 --> 01:57:53,650
[Harry] All right.

1845
01:57:57,237 --> 01:58:00,407
[grunts] No, see, that's open.
It's not gonna seal.

1846
01:58:00,491 --> 01:58:02,534
Yeah. It's buckling.

1847
01:58:02,618 --> 01:58:04,620
All right,
let's dive the others out.

1848
01:58:04,703 --> 01:58:06,580
Then we'll get him sorted.
Yeah?

1849
01:58:06,663 --> 01:58:10,000
Okay, I got this.
It's pink. I like it.

1850
01:58:10,083 --> 01:58:12,211
[Rick] All right,
so, who's next?

1851
01:58:12,294 --> 01:58:13,128
[in Thai]

1852
01:58:13,212 --> 01:58:14,338
I can't swim.

1853
01:58:15,005 --> 01:58:16,924
Will we survive?

1854
01:58:17,007 --> 01:58:19,885
Don't be afraid.
We have to trust them.

1855
01:58:23,222 --> 01:58:24,264
[in English] Okay.

1856
01:58:27,476 --> 01:58:28,644
Okay, turn around.

1857
01:58:32,773 --> 01:58:33,982
[Harry] Who have we got here?

1858
01:58:34,066 --> 01:58:35,651
- This is Prem.
- [Harry] Prem.

1859
01:58:35,734 --> 01:58:37,337
Come on down, Prem.
Let's get you outta here.

1860
01:58:37,361 --> 01:58:38,278
[in Thai]

1861
01:58:38,362 --> 01:58:40,531
Are we the last to go?

1862
01:58:40,614 --> 01:58:41,990
[Coach Ek] Mmm.

1863
01:58:42,074 --> 01:58:43,301
[Harry in English]
Chris is diving you out.

1864
01:58:43,325 --> 01:58:44,993
You know, Chris, see,

1865
01:58:45,077 --> 01:58:48,372
he's the number one rescue
diver in the whole world.

1866
01:58:48,455 --> 01:58:49,623
That's me.

1867
01:58:49,706 --> 01:58:51,684
All right. Prem, you know
the drill. You've seen this.

1868
01:58:51,708 --> 01:58:53,293
Do you wanna look up? Ready?

1869
01:58:58,340 --> 01:59:01,426
All right. Yep.

1870
01:59:01,510 --> 01:59:02,719
Off you go.

1871
01:59:07,558 --> 01:59:08,892
[instructing in Thai]

1872
01:59:18,735 --> 01:59:20,362
[in English]
All right. One more to go.

1873
01:59:21,864 --> 01:59:23,782
Your choice. Up or down?

1874
01:59:23,866 --> 01:59:25,951
Up.

1875
01:59:26,034 --> 01:59:28,036
There you go.
That was pretty painless.

1876
01:59:29,705 --> 01:59:32,082
We're gonna get you home.
Maybe for dinner.

1877
01:59:32,916 --> 01:59:33,917
Hmm?

1878
01:59:36,670 --> 01:59:37,671
Hmm.

1879
01:59:45,429 --> 01:59:46,698
[Jason] It's the best we can do.

1880
01:59:46,722 --> 01:59:48,765
If I pull it too tight,
it'll collapse the seal.

1881
01:59:48,849 --> 01:59:50,434
[Harry]
It's still a little loose.

1882
01:59:50,517 --> 01:59:52,269
We don't have time.
The water is rising.

1883
01:59:52,352 --> 01:59:54,232
If he doesn't come out now,
he doesn't come out.

1884
01:59:56,440 --> 01:59:57,691
I'll keep it from bumping.

1885
01:59:57,774 --> 01:59:58,942
I can hold it if I have to.

1886
02:00:03,113 --> 02:00:04,156
It's your call.

1887
02:00:04,823 --> 02:00:06,116
I'll be going slow.

1888
02:00:06,199 --> 02:00:07,784
So give me some space
before you follow.

1889
02:00:18,962 --> 02:00:20,162
[heavy breathing through mask]

1890
02:00:26,803 --> 02:00:27,721

1891
02:00:27,804 --> 02:00:29,348
The boys?

1892
02:00:29,431 --> 02:00:31,224
Are they out safely?

1893
02:00:32,017 --> 02:00:34,770
We hope so. Your turn now.

1894
02:00:37,439 --> 02:00:38,523

[grunts]

1897
02:01:03,298 --> 02:01:05,258
He's no heavier than the boys.

1898
02:01:07,427 --> 02:01:08,720
[Harry]
I'll be right behind you.

1899
02:01:08,804 --> 02:01:10,222
Not too close.

1900
02:01:11,640 --> 02:01:12,849
See you at the pub.

1901
02:01:14,017 --> 02:01:15,185

[muffled grunt]

1905
02:02:29,301 --> 02:02:31,720
All right.
I guess it's our turn now.

1906
02:02:31,803 --> 02:02:33,764
You go. We follow.

1907
02:02:33,847 --> 02:02:36,058
Yeah. I mean, remember,

1908
02:02:36,141 --> 02:02:38,643
the current is much stronger
than it was.

1909
02:02:38,727 --> 02:02:41,021
- And the water is, you know.
- Yeah.

1910
02:02:41,104 --> 02:02:42,355
[reporter speaking Thai on TV]

1911
02:02:42,439 --> 02:02:47,486
The clock is ticking,
putting pressure on the rescue team.

1912
02:02:47,569 --> 02:02:52,491
The fear is the heavy downpour
will push water back into the cave

1913
02:02:52,574 --> 02:02:58,246
faster than the volunteers
can divert the rain from the mountain.

1914

Hello, hello, hello!

1919
02:03:19,392 --> 02:03:21,353
Okay. Okay.

1920
02:03:21,436 --> 02:03:23,063

[John] Okay, Jason.

1933
02:04:23,498 --> 02:04:25,417

Steady now, lads.

1940
02:04:53,153 --> 02:04:54,193
[Charlie] We got a visual.

[siren wailing]

1942
02:05:16,593 --> 02:05:17,593
Chris.

1943
02:05:18,553 --> 02:05:19,553
Rick.

1944
02:05:21,932 --> 02:05:23,642
It's really good to see you.

1945
02:05:23,725 --> 02:05:25,810
I didn't know if anyone
was gonna be able to...

1946
02:05:25,894 --> 02:05:27,604
Is he alive?

1947
02:05:27,687 --> 02:05:29,022
- [Chris] Uh, yeah.
- [Rick] Yeah?

1948
02:05:29,105 --> 02:05:30,899
No, yeah, he is, yeah. I...

1949
02:05:30,982 --> 02:05:32,776
I lost the line back there.

1950
02:05:32,859 --> 02:05:34,945
I found a power cable
and followed it here.

1951
02:05:35,779 --> 02:05:37,364
I, uh...

1952
02:05:37,447 --> 02:05:38,573
I don't know where I am.

1953
02:05:38,657 --> 02:05:40,075
[Rick] You're still
in Chamber 4.

1954
02:05:40,158 --> 02:05:41,201
Well done.

1955
02:05:41,284 --> 02:05:42,869
[breathes heavily]

1956
02:05:44,079 --> 02:05:45,163
Keep him topped up.

1957
02:05:46,122 --> 02:05:47,415
You'll be fine.

1958
02:05:47,499 --> 02:05:49,918
Wait for Harry.
He's coming now.

1959
02:05:50,001 --> 02:05:51,294
Let him have a look, yeah?

1960
02:05:51,378 --> 02:05:53,046
Yeah. Yeah.

1961
02:05:53,129 --> 02:05:55,382
Your only duty is to that boy.

1962
02:05:55,465 --> 02:05:56,716
We'll get you out.

1963
02:05:58,593 --> 02:05:59,803
So get ready.

1964
02:05:59,886 --> 02:06:01,471
Yeah. Okay.

1965
02:06:01,554 --> 02:06:03,265
Put his mask on

1966
02:06:03,348 --> 02:06:06,351
and do whatever Harry says
is best. Got it?

1967
02:06:07,185 --> 02:06:08,603
