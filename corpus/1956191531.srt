<i>THROUGHOUT THE AGES,</i>

3
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,955
<i>ANIMALS WERE TOLD
OF A SECRET PASS</i>

4
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:42,323
<i>THAT WAS HIGH UP
IN THE MOUNTAINS,</i>

5
00:00:42,325 --> 00:00:45,259
<i>THROUGH WHICH THEY WOULD FIND
A PLACE THAT KEPT THEM SAFE</i>

6
00:00:45,261 --> 00:00:46,997
<i>FROM THE HANDS OF MAN...</i>

7
00:00:48,731 --> 00:00:51,732
<i>THAT ANY ANIMAL THAT
WAS LOST AND ALONE</i>

8
00:00:51,734 --> 00:00:53,301
<i>WOULD BE DRAWN
TO THIS PLACE</i>

9
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,640
<i>AND THROUGH THE SECRET PASS
IT WOULD BE FOUND.</i>

10
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,573
<i>IT IS A PLACE FAR BEYOND DREAMS</i>

11
00:00:59,575 --> 00:01:02,310
<i>WHERE THEY
MAY LIVE FREE AND UNAFRAID.</i>

12
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:06,147
<i>IT IS A PLACE CALLED
NATOCCHUE.</i>

13
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:09,284
<i>A PLACE THEY WILL BE LED
TO BY THE GUARDIANS,</i>

14
00:01:09,286 --> 00:01:11,286
<i>WHO HAVE BEEN CHOSEN
BY THE SPIRIT WIND</i>

15
00:01:11,288 --> 00:01:13,688
<i>FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION</i>

16
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,224
<i>TO GUIDE THE ANIMALS
ON THEIR JOURNEY,</i>

17
00:01:16,226 --> 00:01:19,760
<i>ENTRUSTED TO WATCH
OVER THEM LIKE ANGELS.</i>

18
00:01:19,762 --> 00:01:23,465
<i>BUT IT WAS TOLD THAT ONE DAY
A GREAT EVIL WOULD RETURN</i>

19
00:01:23,467 --> 00:01:26,301
<i>TO CLAIM NATOCCHUE
FOR HIMSELF BY TAKING OVER</i>

20
00:01:26,303 --> 00:01:28,670
<i>THE VERY SPIRIT
OF ALL THE ANIMALS.</i>

21
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:31,438
<i>CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE
IS AN INNOCENT BOY</i>

22
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,742
<i>AND RESTING SQUARELY
ON HIS SHOULDERS</i>

23
00:01:33,744 --> 00:01:36,514
<i>IS THE OUTCOME
OF THIS ANCIENT CONFLICT.</i>

24

BUT IT'S NOT RIGHT GRANDPA,

392
00:25:50,532 --> 00:25:51,964
WHY'D THE MOUNTAIN
HAVE TO TAKE 'EM AWAY?

393
00:25:51,966 --> 00:25:53,700
THE MOUNTAIN
DIDN'T TAKE THEM, SON.

394
00:25:53,702 --> 00:25:56,837
THEY, THEY DIED PROTECTING
WHAT THEY LOVED.

395
00:25:56,839 --> 00:26:00,607
THE MOUNTAIN,
IT'S MORE LIKE

396
00:26:00,609 --> 00:26:02,876

TELL ME, I'M OLD ENOUGH
TO KNOW THE TRUTH.

402
00:26:20,596 --> 00:26:22,596
YOU'LL KNOW SOON ENOUGH.

403
00:26:22,598 --> 00:26:24,964
MUCH SOONER THAN I THOUGHT.

404
00:26:24,966 --> 00:26:28,534
MEANTIME, BEST IF YOU DON'T

424
00:30:59,307 --> 00:31:00,973
WHO'S THE WOMAN
IN THE WIND?

425
00:31:00,975 --> 00:31:02,809
PARKER, THE BOSS
SAID TO WATCH

426
00:31:02,811 --> 00:31:04,543

00:31:12,286 --> 00:31:14,052
DID SHE

431
00:31:14,054 --> 00:31:16,292
HEY, WHAT, WHO ARE YOU GUYS?

00:31:18,225 --> 00:31:20,827

433
00:31:20,829 --> 00:31:24,030
I'M AFRAID HE HAS
A REALLY BAD TEMPER.

00:31:26,868 --> 00:31:29,301
COME ON, WHO ARE YOU GUYS?

435
00:31:29,303 --> 00:31:30,739

00:31:31,907 --> 00:31:34,307
THAT'S IT, THIS IS A DREAM!

437
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,875
WHY WOULD YOU

438
00:31:35,877 --> 00:31:38,310
BECAUSE I'M STANDING HERE

HOW CAN THIS BE?

468
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:36,663
HE HASN'T COME OF AGE.

I KNOW,

470
00:33:39,234 --> 00:33:42,702
AND THERE CAN ONLY
BE ONE REASON WHY...

471
00:33:42,704 --> 00:33:45,241
CALABAR HAS RETURNED.

YOU KNOW, YOU NEED TO GET MORE
IN TOUCH WITH YOUR ANGER.

WHAT EXACTLY WAS HIS IDEA?

618
00:41:20,594 --> 00:41:22,094
WE DIDN'T MEAN TO PUSH
THE BOY OFF THE CLIFF!

619
00:41:22,096 --> 00:41:23,462
I WOULDN'T HURT ANYBODY.

620
00:41:24,866 --> 00:41:26,398
WHY NOT?

621
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,735

00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:30,938
COME HERE...

623
00:41:34,574 --> 00:41:36,641
IT WAS SO SIMPLE!

624
00:41:36,643 --> 00:41:39,578
ALL YOU FOOLS HAD
TO DO WAS WATCH THE HOUSE

625
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,880
AND TELL ME WHAT
THE OLE MAN WAS UP TO.

626
00:41:41,882 --> 00:41:44,949
INSTEAD YOU BONEHEADS
KNOCK THE KID OFF A CLIFF!

627
00:41:44,951 --> 00:41:46,819
OUUUUU.

628
00:41:46,821 --> 00:41:49,725
YOUR INCOMPETENCE
CANNOT GO UNPUNISHED.

629
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,592
OH, FIRE!

630
00:41:54,594 --> 00:41:56,529

00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:03,101
SO YOU THINK

632
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:06,070
WELL, IT'S JUST THAT...

633
00:42:06,072 --> 00:42:09,808
OW OOO!

634
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:12,777
ACTUALLY THIS IS KINDA FUNNY.

635
00:42:12,779 --> 00:42:16,782
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY
BEFORE I FRY YOUR BACON?

636
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:19,087
NOW PARKER, QUICK, TELL
'IM ABOUT THE WIND...

637
00:42:21,755 --> 00:42:23,655
YEAH, BOSS,

638
00:42:23,657 --> 00:42:26,491
THERE WAS THIS WEIRD WOMAN
FLOATING IN THE WIND.

639
00:42:26,493 --> 00:42:28,496
SHE SHOWED UP AND PUT THE BOY
UNDER SOME KIND OF SPELL...

640
00:42:31,998 --> 00:42:35,067
THE BOY WITH
THE SPIRIT WIND.

641
00:42:35,069 --> 00:42:37,936
THIS IS AN INTERESTING
DEVELOPMENT.

642
00:42:37,938 --> 00:42:40,505
AHHH.

643
00:42:40,507 --> 00:42:42,076
WHOA!

644
00:42:49,217 --> 00:42:50,819
GET OFF ME!

645
00:42:53,888 --> 00:42:55,221
GO ON.

646
00:42:55,223 --> 00:42:56,755
DO TELL.

647
00:42:56,757 --> 00:42:58,056
NOW.

648
00:42:58,058 --> 00:43:00,259
SO WE GOT CLOSER TO
GET A BETTER LOOK

649
00:43:00,261 --> 00:43:01,893
AND THAT SPIRIT THING MOVED
STRAIGHT THROUGH HIM

650
00:43:01,895 --> 00:43:04,663
THEN, SOMEHOW THE BOY
JUST DISAPPEARED BOSS.

651
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:06,065
YEAH NEXT THING WE SEE
THE BOY'S FALLING

652
00:43:06,067 --> 00:43:10,201
THEN THIS HUGE BIRD CAME,
AND UH, ALL OF A SUDDEN...

653
00:43:10,203 --> 00:43:14,206
NOW LISTEN CAREFULLY MY FINE
DIM-WITTED CRETINS.

654
00:43:14,208 --> 00:43:16,942
DID THE SPIRIT WIND SING
TO THE BOY?

655
00:43:16,944 --> 00:43:19,677
WE DIDN'T HEAR NO SINGING,
RIGHT LOO?

656
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,779
YEAH. I MEAN NO.

657
00:43:20,781 --> 00:43:23,248
I MEAN I'M SAYING YES,
NO... THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

658
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:25,617
NO SINGIN', NOT
A SINGIN' SONG AT ALL.

659
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:26,886
JUST SOME STRANGE FACE
IN THE WIND...

660
00:43:26,888 --> 00:43:28,156
OOHHH!

661
00:43:29,991 --> 00:43:33,058
AND SO IT BEGINS,
I WILL GET WHAT I NEED

662
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:35,527
FROM THE UNSUSPECTING BOY.

663
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:36,929
HE WILL BE A MUCH
WEAKER TARGET

664
00:43:36,931 --> 00:43:39,998
THAN HIS
DEAR OLE GRANDPA.

665
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:46,905
FINALLY, THE BOY, THE WIND SONG,
THE OLE MAN AND ME.

666
00:43:46,907 --> 00:43:50,009
LET'S JUST THINK OF THIS AS
...A FAMILY AFFAIR.

667
00:44:18,272 --> 00:44:19,771
GO AHEAD.

668
00:44:19,773 --> 00:44:20,542
OK.

669
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:27,012
WOW, THAT'S A,
THAT'S A SWEET RIDE.

670
00:44:27,014 --> 00:44:28,746
WHATEVER.

671
00:44:28,748 --> 00:44:29,782
WHAT DO YOU WANT ANYWAY?

672
00:44:29,784 --> 00:44:34,320
WELL-AH-IT'S LIKE
A LITTLE HARD FOR ME TO SAY,

673
00:44:34,322 --> 00:44:37,590
- BUT A... SHNEL,

674
00:44:37,592 --> 00:44:41,059
I JUST WANTED TO TH
TH TH TH THANK YOU FOR...

675
00:44:41,061 --> 00:44:43,094
SAVING MY LIFE
WHEN THE DUST DEVIL...

676
00:44:43,096 --> 00:44:44,096
YOU WERE IN TROUBLE.
I HELPED.

677
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,967
THAT'S ALL.
NO BIG DEAL.

678
00:44:47,234 --> 00:44:49,638
MANU, COME BACK TO THE FIRE.

679
00:44:53,174 --> 00:44:54,607
ANYWAY, YOU'RE WELCOME.

680
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:56,645

681
00:44:58,679 --> 00:45:01,746
ADMIT IT,

682
00:45:01,748 --> 00:45:04,248
OK, OK ALREADY. I ADMIT IT.
I LIKE HIM.

683
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:06,587
BUT IF YOU
TELL ANYBODY-I'LL DENY IT.

684
00:45:21,335 --> 00:45:23,969
EVER SINCE YOU WERE
A BABY, MANU,

685
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:26,005
I'VE HAD THIS VISION.

686
00:45:26,007 --> 00:45:30,241
THAT WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR
FATHER, HAPPENS TO YOU.

687
00:45:30,243 --> 00:45:34,615
I'VE TRIED TO PROTECT YOU, BUT
NOW IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO KNOW.

688
00:45:37,717 --> 00:45:40,319
SINCE LONG BEFORE
THE TIME OF THE OLD ONES,

689
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:43,422
WE HAVE BEEN PROTECTORS
OF ANIMALS.

690
00:45:43,424 --> 00:45:46,425
GUARDIANS OF THOSE
WHO LIFE HAS ABANDONED.

691
00:45:46,427 --> 00:45:49,795
THE ONES WHO HAVE
LOST THEIR WAY.

692
00:45:49,797 --> 00:45:51,329
LIKE US.

693
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:53,165
IT IS THE DUTY
OF THE GUARDIANS

694
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:55,266
TO LEAD THEM TO SAFETY.

695
00:45:55,268 --> 00:45:58,070
THROUGH THE SECRET PASS
TO A PLACE CALLED...

696
00:45:58,072 --> 00:46:00,038
NATOCCHUE.

697
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:07,378
TO THIS DUTY THE SPIRIT WIND
CALLED MY FATHER.

698
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,649
SHE CALLED ME.

699
00:46:11,384 --> 00:46:15,887
SHE CALLED... MY SON...

700
00:46:15,889 --> 00:46:18,290
YOUR FATHER, MANU.

701
00:46:18,292 --> 00:46:20,224
AND LAST NIGHT SHE CALLED...

702
00:46:20,226 --> 00:46:21,696
THE NEXT GUARDIAN.

703
00:46:24,799 --> 00:46:26,331
HIM?

704
00:46:26,333 --> 00:46:28,166
WOW!

705
00:46:28,168 --> 00:46:30,069
ME?

706
00:46:30,071 --> 00:46:31,704
YES. YOU.

707
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:35,273
WHAT??!!?...NO WAY!

708
00:46:35,275 --> 00:46:38,279
MANU, YOU HAVE TO LISTEN,
LET HIM FINISH...

709
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,213
I HAD THREE CHILDREN.

710
00:46:42,215 --> 00:46:44,083
YOUR AUNT NITIKA,

711
00:46:44,085 --> 00:46:48,119
YOUR FATHER AND THE OTHER
WAS... YOUR UNCLE, CALABAR.

712
00:46:48,121 --> 00:46:49,887
MY UNCLE?

713
00:46:49,889 --> 00:46:54,159
YES, I BANISHED HIM
FROM THE FAMILY LONG AGO.

714
00:46:54,161 --> 00:46:58,262
HE SWORE TO DESTROY US, AND
MAKE HIMSELF THE NEXT GUARDIAN

715
00:46:58,264 --> 00:47:00,933
AND RULE NATOCCHUE.

716
00:47:00,935 --> 00:47:02,867
- NOW HE HAS RETURNED...
- THAT'S GREAT!

717
00:47:02,869 --> 00:47:05,503
LET HIM SPEND THE REST OF HIS
LIFE BEING SOME KIND A...

718
00:47:05,505 --> 00:47:07,676
SHEEPHERDER
FOR A BUNCH OF FLEABAGS!

719
00:47:09,509 --> 00:47:11,242
WE CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN!

720
00:47:11,244 --> 00:47:14,112
CALABAR'S HEART
IS PURE EVIL!

721
00:47:14,114 --> 00:47:16,447
YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT
TO BE, GRANDPA!

722
00:47:16,449 --> 00:47:18,483
YOU KNOW MY HEART
WAS SET ON RACING.

723
00:47:18,485 --> 00:47:20,819
YOU KNOW IT!
YOU ALL KNOW IT.

724
00:47:20,821 --> 00:47:22,723
A GUARDIAN, NO WAY!

725
00:47:23,891 --> 00:47:25,157
MANU!

726
00:47:25,159 --> 00:47:26,224
HEY.

727
00:47:26,226 --> 00:47:29,161
WAIT A MOMENT,

728
00:47:29,163 --> 00:47:30,431
HE HAS A LOT TO THINK OVER.

729
00:47:31,898 --> 00:47:34,366
HE SHOULDN'T BE ALONE,
GRANDPA.

730
00:47:34,368 --> 00:47:38,936
I KNOW, BUT FIRST HE MUST
LOOK INSIDE HIMSELF.

731
00:47:38,938 --> 00:47:41,974
FOR ONLY HE CAN CHOOSE
THE PATH HE WILL TAKE

732
00:47:41,976 --> 00:47:43,945
AND THEN SHOW
THE STRENGTH TO WALK IT.

733
00:47:46,179 --> 00:47:47,913
I THINK I'LL GO HAVE
TALK WITH HIM.

734
00:47:47,915 --> 00:47:50,181
HE COULD USE A LITTLE
OF MY STREETWISE EXCELLENCE.

735
00:47:50,183 --> 00:47:53,085
SEE, I TOLD YA YOU LIKE HIM.

736
00:48:34,027 --> 00:48:35,326
WHOA, WHOA!

737
00:48:35,328 --> 00:48:37,929
HEY RELAX,
IT'S, IT'S JUST ME.

738
00:48:37,931 --> 00:48:39,431
NICA, WHAT'RE YOU
DOING HERE?

739
00:48:39,433 --> 00:48:40,898
I'M CONCERNED.

740
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:42,236
DO YOU MIND?

741
00:48:44,938 --> 00:48:47,873
MANU, I UNDERSTAND WHAT
YOU ARE GOING THROUGH.

742
00:48:47,875 --> 00:48:50,342
YA RIGHT, YOU'RE NOT THE ONE WHO
HAS TO GIVE UP ALL THEIR DREAMS

743
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:52,578
- JUST TO...
- MANU, PLEASE LISTEN.

744
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:55,346
LAST YEAR I WAS
TOLD THE FAMILY SECRET.

745
00:48:55,348 --> 00:48:58,250
IT WAS MY TIME
TO KNOW.

746
00:48:58,252 --> 00:49:01,853
YES, THAT'S RIGHT,
I KNOW.

747
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:04,456
I LEARNED ABOUT THE ANIMALS,
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,

748
00:49:04,458 --> 00:49:06,224
YOUR DESTINY.

749
00:49:06,226 --> 00:49:08,025
YOU OF ALL PEOPLE NICA.

750
00:49:08,027 --> 00:49:09,194
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME?

751
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:11,195
I MADE A PROMISE NOT TO.

752
00:49:11,197 --> 00:49:13,465
GRANDPA WOULD PREPARE
YOU WHEN IT WAS YOUR TIME.

753
00:49:13,467 --> 00:49:16,168
BUT HE DIDN'T,
DON'T YOU GET IT?

754
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:18,170
ONE MINUTE I'M TAKIN'
WINDFLIER TO THE RACE;

755
00:49:18,172 --> 00:49:20,204
THE NEXT MINUTE I'M TALKIN'
TO ANIMALS...

756
00:49:20,206 --> 00:49:22,206
DON'T BLAME GRANDPA,

757
00:49:22,208 --> 00:49:24,643
THE SPIRIT WIND CHOSE YOU
SOONER THAN HE EXPECTED.

758
00:49:24,645 --> 00:49:26,545
BUT WHY?

759
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:28,880
AN EVIL SO POWERFUL
HAS COME TO THIS PLACE

760
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:31,315
THAT EVEN GRANDPA
CAN'T DEFEAT IT ALONE.

761
00:49:31,317 --> 00:49:32,351
GET IT?

762
00:49:32,353 --> 00:49:34,389
HE NEEDS YOUR HELP.

763
00:49:35,956 --> 00:49:37,489
COME BACK TO
THE CAMP WITH ME.

764
00:49:37,491 --> 00:49:39,157
GRANDPA WILL SHOW YOU.

765
00:49:39,159 --> 00:49:41,927
WE ALL ARE
DEPENDING ON YOU MANU.

766
00:49:41,929 --> 00:49:43,962
I BELIEVE IN YOU...

767
00:49:47,368 --> 00:49:49,369
SHHH!

768
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:57,409
NICA?

769
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:59,480
NICA WHERE ARE YOU?

770
00:50:31,377 --> 00:50:35,547
AHHH, WHOA,
NICA DID YOU HEAR THAT?

771
00:50:35,549 --> 00:50:38,951
NO MANU, ONLY YOU CAN HEAR
THE WINDSONG.

772
00:50:40,286 --> 00:50:44,221
I'M SURE IT'S... LOVELY.

773
00:50:44,223 --> 00:50:45,958
A PITY I CAN'T HEAR IT.

774
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:49,027
THEN I COULD SING ALONG.

775
00:50:49,029 --> 00:50:51,132
HUH?

776
00:51:02,208 --> 00:51:05,009
WHO ARE YOU?

777
00:51:05,011 --> 00:51:08,081
AH, YOUR GREAT AND GLORIOUS
GRANDFATHER DIDN'T TELL YOU?

778
00:51:09,717 --> 00:51:11,717
WELL.

779
00:51:11,719 --> 00:51:15,387
LET'S JUST SAY I'M...
A MUSIC LOVER.

00:51:15,389 --> 00:51:16,989

781
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:19,424
AT YOUR SERVICE.

782
00:51:19,426 --> 00:51:23,527
NOW... WHAT EXACTLY
DID YOU HEAR?

783
00:51:23,529 --> 00:51:24,397
I DON'T REMEMBER.

784
00:51:26,232 --> 00:51:29,201

788
00:51:40,714 --> 00:51:42,583

789
00:51:52,759 --> 00:51:55,594
OOOOOOO,

791
00:51:57,431 --> 00:51:58,730
BUT HE WILL.

792
00:52:01,735 --> 00:52:03,268
HEY, I GET IT.

793
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:05,670

THE SONG.

801
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:24,556
THE KEY IS THE SONG.

802
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,190

00:52:26,192 --> 00:52:27,692

VENGEANCE IS MINE!

848
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:27,771
IT DOESN'T HAVE

00:55:27,773 --> 00:55:29,509
YES IT DOES!

850
00:55:35,281 --> 00:55:36,750
HURRY RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

851
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:41,319
WE'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT.

TODAY I BECOME
THE LAST GUARDIAN!

855
00:55:59,473 --> 00:56:03,474
YOU ARE NOT WORTHY!

856
00:56:03,476 --> 00:56:06,647
WORTHY IN YOUR EYES MEANS
NOTHING TO ME, OLD MAN!

857
00:56:10,016 --> 00:56:14,355
YOU WILL NEVER... GIVE
MY CALLING... TO THAT BRAT.

858
00:56:16,389 --> 00:56:18,523
THE CALLING
IS NOT MINE TO GIVE.

859
00:56:18,525 --> 00:56:20,795
BUT YOUR BLACK HEART COULD
NEVER UNDERSTAND THAT.

860
00:56:24,931 --> 00:56:26,797
WELL UNDERSTAND
THIS FATHER,

861
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:29,970
THE BOY HAS THE KEY
AND THE KEY IS MINE!

862
00:56:41,415 --> 00:56:43,014
BE GONE, IT'S OVER.

863
00:56:43,016 --> 00:56:45,516
NOW LEAVE THIS PLACE.

864
00:56:45,518 --> 00:56:49,256
THIS WILL ONLY BE OVER WHEN
THE POWER OF NATOCCHUE IS MINE.

865
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:57,494
BE WARNED FATHER,
WHEN NEXT WE MEET

866
00:56:57,496 --> 00:56:59,699
YOUR DESTRUCTION
WILL BE ASSURED.

867
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:08,806
THREE WORDS.

868
00:57:08,808 --> 00:57:10,708
ANG-GER-MANAGEMENT.

869
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:13,578
THAT'S TWO WORDS,
OKAY ADD THE WORD&

870
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:16,516
AHHHHHH!!!

871
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:34,534
GRANDPA?

872
00:57:49,949 --> 00:57:52,384
NOPE, HE'S NOT A GONER!

873
00:57:52,386 --> 00:57:56,587
NAH... HE'S OKAY,
JUST DEAD ...TO THE WORLD.

874
00:57:56,589 --> 00:58:00,090
LISTEN, KID, IF YOUR CURRENT
CONDITION TURNS PERMANENT.

875
00:58:00,092 --> 00:58:01,592
GO INTO THE LIGHT.

876
00:58:01,594 --> 00:58:03,962
LOOK FOR A LADY TORTOISE
NAMED ZELDA

877
00:58:03,964 --> 00:58:05,797
AND GIVE HER
A MESSAGE FOR ME.

878
00:58:05,799 --> 00:58:08,869
IRA, HE'S NOT GOI''
ANYWHERE.

879
00:58:16,877 --> 00:58:17,945
GRANDPA!

880
00:58:19,846 --> 00:58:21,746
IT'S OK.

881
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:24,416
I SAW YOU,
