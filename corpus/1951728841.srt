0
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,935
Let's have a look at the map.

1
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:12,582
So, according to police reports,

2
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:15,348
the missing tourist was
camping near the river here.

3
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,082
Right.

4
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:18,680
What do we know about this guy?

5
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,658
He was just
an amateur photographer.

6
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:23,389
- They never found his body.
- Right.

7
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:25,761
The rescue teams searched
the whole area for a week.

8
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:27,094
And nothing.

9
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,134
Guy completely vanished.

10
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:32,467
Now, the only thing
they found was his camera.

11
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,599
Those are his last shots.

12
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:37,665
Let's see.

13
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:41,746
These are some crappy shots.

14
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:46,376
I just want you to focus on
the very last picture he took.

15
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,554
It's exactly like
the drawing in your book.

16
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:57,758
Wow, man.

17
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,958
This is a creepy tree.

18
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,366
This cannot be a coincidence.

19
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:09,473
And according to
my grandfather's manuscript,

20
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:11,874
once we find the tree

21
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,579
we will also find
the secret burial ground.

22
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,989
I just hope it's not a bunch
of old skeletons down there.

23
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:28,823
Guys, we're gonna find this tree.

24
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:29,987
All righty.

25
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:33,229
Let's go.

26
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:57,515
Look, I don't mind doing
some digging and stuff.

27
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,524
Finally get my hands
on some cash.

28
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:01,457
Got everything?

29
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,687
Yeah.

30
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,472
Where's he going?

31
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:27,638
So. This is the river.

32
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:30,648
And this is where
the guy was camping.

33
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:33,082
Now, based on the reports,

34
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:35,586
they found his camera
a few miles up the river.

35
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,714
That means...

36
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,224
we're gonna have to cover
all this area.

37
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:45,162
And this is where
Flipp's gonna build our tent.

38
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:46,289
Right, Flipp?

39
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,970
Flipp? Where is he?

40
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:53,928
You hear that?

41
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,856
Take your shoes off.

42
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:21,627
Did you grow up
in a barn or somethin'?

43
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,760
Take your shoes off.

44
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,030
Jesus Christ.

45
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,409
That's it?

46
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:45,284
Beans?

47
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,750
Tell me you're joking.

48
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:52,094
A man can actually live on beans

49
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:53,756
and nothing else.

50
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:57,195
What kind of a man is that?

51
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,199
Corned beef?

52
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:08,707
- Flipp, you're a lifesaver.
- I don't think so.

53
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:14,044
I'm on a low-carb diet.

54
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,054
I thought we agreed to
share everything equally.

55
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:18,090
You thought, maybe. Not me.

56
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:22,326
Here you go, Sai.
This is for you.

57
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,556
Hey! That dog eats
better than I do.

58
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,531
I'm sorry.
Would you like some?

59
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,999
- Forget it.
- Please.

60
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,626
No. I got some doughnuts
back in the tent.

61
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:31,692
All right.

62
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:36,969
Flipp, want some beans?

63
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,510
No, I'm fine, thanks.

64
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,670
Do you want some corned beef?

65
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,906
- I'm good, thanks.
- All right.

66
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,712
Is that your grandfather?

67
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,374
Yeah.

68
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,112
He had Cherokee blood.

69
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:23,815
He spent his entire life studying
the people that lived in these forests.

70
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,858
Their secrets, their legends.

71
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:28,916
Rituals.

72
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:32,720
Then, when he passed away,
he left me his journal.

73
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,397
Who's the girl next to the tree?

74
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:44,135
That's Satinka. She's a ghost.

75
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,976
Her fingers are made
of little tiny branches.

76
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:51,141
And her soul was cursed
by this tree right here.

77
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:57,778
What's funny?

78
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:59,381
Your grandfather was
really fucked up, man.

79
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,824
I bet he was smokin' some real
good shit when he wrote that.

80
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:09,624
You know, there's some
really unique stuff in here.

81
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:12,830
That's why I want
to get it published.

82
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:15,874
What about
the secret burial ground?

83
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:17,431
And your fuckin' treasure?

84
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,276
You know what?
It's not at all about the money.

85
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,906
It's real important to me
to honor my grandfather's memory.

86
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:25,841
Cheers to your grandfather.

87
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:29,544
I can't, man.
I got a lot of work to do.

88
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:32,981
Sai? Come on, boy.
Get out. Please.

89
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:35,414
Sai?

90
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,149
Sai.

91
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:47,465
"Once the twig enters
the skin, an infection occurs.

92
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:50,468
That's how the spirit
marks his victims."

93
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:13,219
Oh, God!
What the fuck is that?

94
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:54,028
"The victim will slowly
start to get sick...

95
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:57,626
"and will ultimately be paralyzed,

96
00:13:57,703 --> 00:14:01,332
as if he were under the effect
of a strong venom."

97
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:07,267
Where did you go?

98
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,337
This place sucks, man.

99
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,283
I want to go home.

100
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,340
What happened?

101
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:18,749
Let me see.

102
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:20,792
It's okay, man.
It's just a scratch.

103
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:25,422
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

104
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:33,931
Oh, gee.

105
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:53,522
Get on your dancin' shoes

106
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:56,720
You sexy little swine

107
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:59,355
Hey, Flipp! Get your ass
out of bed. Go get your dog.

108
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:03,060
Cool shot.

109
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,995
Hey, Flipp. Wake up, man.

110
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,300
Josh.

111
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:13,672
What?

112
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,941
I'm gonna search
the left side of the river.

113
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:18,415
And I want you and Flipp
to explore the right side.

114
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,213
How much digging have we got?

115
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:23,119
According to the legend,

116
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:25,122
the secret burial ground
is just below the tree.

117
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,522
How deep, I don't know.

118
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,993
Why? Got any problems?

119
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,758
Me? No. Flipp, yeah.
He's my problem.

120
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:35,026
Guy's got a PhD in laziness.

121
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,534
Hey, Flipp! Come on, get up.
We got work to do.

122
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:44,698
Flipp!

123
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,944
Where is he?

124
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:50,242
I don't know.

125
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,784
He was down by the river
with his dog.

126
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:56,511
All right.
I'm gonna go look for him.

127
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:40,053
Flipp!

128
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:30,538
We're not alone.

129
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:43,726
Hey, look what I found.
A <i>Datura stramonium.</i>

130
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,394
Blooms once in every six years.

131
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:49,890
Let's cut it.

132
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,061
Careful.

133
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:03,476
Don't smell it.
It causes hallucinations.

134
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:04,743
I know.

135
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,520
Back from where I'm from, every kid
used to get high on 'shrooms.

136
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,750
And then we'd go back
to this barn and make out.

137
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,662
Come on, let's go. We only have
two more to go before we go back.

138
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,755
Can I make some tea with this?

139
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:24,196
It's tempting.

140
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,794
No.

141
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:28,100
No, thanks.

142
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:31,836
It'll be fun.

143
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,756
Easy, girl.

144
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:47,189
That's enough.

145
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:48,283
Here you go.

146
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,727
Thank you.

147
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,765
Cheers.
To a long, hard day.

148
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:55,959
Cheers.

149
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:01,970
That is disgusting.

150
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:13,143
You know, it's a shame
we have to leave already.

151
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,485
It's so peaceful out here.

152
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,849
What?

153
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:26,796
Nothing. Just the tea
was a little too hot. That's all.

154
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,370
Jennifer?

155
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,669
What?

156
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:40,669
There was some girl
behind me just now.

157
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,744
I even could feel her breathing.

158
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:46,841
Okay, listen.
No more tea.

159
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:50,683
Hey, Josh!

160
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,860
Just don't fuckin' do that, man.

161
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:05,426
I'm sorry.

162
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:07,905
Any luck?

163
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:09,873
No, man. He's just...

164
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:12,706
Well, he was definitely here
this morning.

165
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:16,604
Must have gotten lost
on his way back.

166
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,709
All right, let's go look for him.

167
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,884
Come on.

168
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:33,890
I feel happy. Yeah.

169
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:37,527
Hooray for nature, Jennifer.

170
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:46,166
What's the matter?

171
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,577
I saw a girl again.

172
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:52,584
I'm glad you think this is funny.
It's not.

173
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:54,585
This is what
you get for drinking this shit.

174
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,419
Drink some water.

175
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,923
You're just dehydrated.

176
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:12,334
We've been out here forever.

177
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:19,538
I think I parked
the truck over there.

178
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:25,142
Sit tight, okay?
And don't go anywhere.

179
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,249
I saw it.

180
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:23,463
Jennifer?

181
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,301
I'm gonna go this way.

182
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,363
All right.

183
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,704
Stop! It's me, Sean!

184
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,144
Shit.

185
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:12,274
What the fuck
did you bring a gun for?

186
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,784
I'm sorry, man.
I thought you were that bastard.

187
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:20,383
Look at you, dude.

188
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,086
There's some kind of
psycho weirdo out there

189
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,492
playing a sick game with us,
planting traps.

190
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,601
They're animal traps.

191
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:33,797
- Must be a hunter.
- A hunter?

192
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:37,330
Oh, that's what it is.
Nice deduction, Columbo.

193
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,336
You want to give me a hand?

194
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:42,437
Fuck.

195
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,146
You okay?

196
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:58,828
Kiyomi!

197
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:18,271
Flipp!

198
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:22,553
Come on, we're wasting time.

199
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:25,546
Where the hell are you?

200
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:31,195
Get your ass out here, now!

201
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,460
I'm gonna go check this way.

202
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,570
Bingo.

203
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:47,202
Hey, I found his dog!

204
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:19,038
Sorry. I guess I was
just a little too impulsive.

205
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,704
It's my friend. Don't kick him.

206
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:26,573
What happened?

207
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,509
You okay?

208
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,021
Yeah.

209
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,521
I'm sorry.
I heard some noises,

210
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,584
and he came running through, and...

211
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:39,129
- I just accidentally...
- Yeah.

212
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:42,132
This is Jennifer, by the way.

213
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,259
- I'm Sean. Hey, I saw you
- Hi.

214
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:45,803
And your friend this morning.

215
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:48,338
She can't find her. Lost?

216
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:50,203
Just like we lost our pothead.

217
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,743
We'll just go look
for them together.

218
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:54,802
- All right?
- Let's go.

219
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:56,608
Don't want to lose
any more time.

220
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:04,378
Kiyomi!

221
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,923
Flipp!

222
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:15,994
It's gonna get dark
pretty soon, so...

223
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:17,398
let's just head back to the car.

224
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:20,233
We'll drive to the first village
and get some help...

225
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,273
get somebody
that knows the area.

226
00:27:58,243 --> 00:27:59,232
Fuck!

227
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:04,339
Don't look at me.

228
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:29,467
Try now?

229
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,300
Nothing.

230
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:04,997
Guys?

231
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:30,431
- Hi.
- Hey.

232
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:34,097
Listen, it's starting to get dark.

233
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:37,608
So we decided we're just gonna
spend the night in the car.

234
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:41,668
We'll just walk to town
in the morning, get some help.

235
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:43,145
Okay.

236
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:45,548
You okay?

237
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:50,445
I'm just a little scared.

238
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:54,024
You think we will find them?

239
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:55,457
We will.

240
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:58,320
Okay.

241
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:04,158
Let's just get some rest.

242
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:10,663
Jennifer?

243
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:56,838
Where's the tree?

244
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,288
You.

245
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:42,292
What's in the bag?

246
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,554
<i>Conium maculatum.</i>

247
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:52,702
You know, that was actually
gonna be my first guess.

248
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:53,828
Right.

249
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:54,997
What is it?

250
00:32:57,508 --> 00:33:00,341
Yeah, here.
Take a look for yourself.

251
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,045
It says here it
"contains several alkaloids

252
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:09,052
"that work by depressing the
function of the central nervous system,

253
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,520
- causing paralysis."
- Correct.

254
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:13,648
"Death occurs when
the muscles used in breathing

255
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:15,955
become completely immobile."

256
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:21,322
It's a very beautiful
and very dangerous flower.

257
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:25,028
Come on, guys.
Flowers, death, alkaloids?

258
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:27,936
I'm tryin' to get
some sleep here.

259
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,667
I thought you were asleep.

260
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:30,833
Just with one eye.

261
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:33,342
I'm gonna take a piss.

262
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:37,608
Hey, man.
Careful with our friend out there.

263
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,242
Who, Bigfoot?

264
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:42,445
I'm takin' the pit bull.

265
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:48,092
Why don't
we just get some rest?

266
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:34,268
<i>Do we know much about it?</i>

267
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:36,738
<i>What exactly is global warming,</i>
<i>and what are its</i>

268
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:37,934
<i>precedents?</i>

269
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:40,000
<i>Is global warming today a reality?</i>

270
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,410
<i>Is global warming</i>
<i>imminent for the future?</i>

271
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:13,138
Jennifer.

272
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:18,143
Where's Josh?

273
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:21,584
I don't know.

274
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:23,745
We should get goin'.

275
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:25,550
I'm gonna go get him, all right?

276
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:33,754
Josh.

277
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:53,909
Kiyomi!

278
00:36:18,242 --> 00:36:19,903
Kiyomi, is that you?

279
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:37,456
Fuck!

280
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:38,517
What the fuck?

281
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:39,858
Hey, just relax!

282
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:41,956
What the fuck?

283
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:44,893
It's all right, mate. It's me.

284
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:46,527
Where'd you come from?

285
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:47,696
Up there, man.

286
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:50,036
Thank God you broke my fall.

287
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:51,096
Mind if I ask you

288
00:36:51,175 --> 00:36:53,405
what the fuck you were
doin' up there?

289
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:54,967
This.

290
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,104
Yeah?

291
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,045
I finally managed
to get some signal.

292
00:36:58,115 --> 00:36:59,104
And?

293
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:01,913
And I got through
to the park ranger.

294
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:02,975
He's gonna send a chopper,

295
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,079
but it's gonna take a few hours.

296
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:08,148
- A chopper?
- Yeah, to find Flipp.

297
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,853
Thank God.

298
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:12,418
Get back to the car.

299
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:13,554
Sure.

300
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:18,025
Kiyomi!

301
00:37:57,908 --> 00:37:59,637
What are you doing down there?

302
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:02,076
You scared the shit out of me.

303
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:07,016
While I was in the car,
I thought I saw Kiyomi.

304
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,044
So I went down
and looked for her,

305
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,748
and somebody was chasing me.

306
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:13,517
Where?

307
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:15,991
I don't know.
I think he just went down there.

308
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:25,468
- Let me give you a hand.
- Okay.

309
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:29,936
Come on, show yourself!

310
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:31,702
Get outta here!

311
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:33,471
Come on, you coward!

312
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,206
Feel better now?

313
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:43,276
Yeah.

314
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:52,089
There's a hunter.

315
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:56,259
We actually saw a bunch
of animal traps yesterday.

316
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,328
He sabotaged the car.

317
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,732
Look.

318
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:21,787
She's punishing me
for hunting in her woods.

319
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:29,692
I'm sorry.

320
00:39:37,174 --> 00:39:39,233
She wants me
to prepare you now.

321
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:42,404
If I don't obey her,
she's gonna kill me.

322
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:12,203
All right, boys, start the engine.

323
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:43,130
All right, let's go
to the nearest town.

324
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,653
What are you doing?

325
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:04,557
Wrong way.

326
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:08,823
But we came that way.

327
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:11,796
Trust me.

328
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:32,082
You okay?

329
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:52,641
We have to follow the river
down to the valley.

330
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,837
Give me the map.

331
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:22,998
<i>She just left her tree.</i>

332
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:24,665
<i>I can feel it.</i>

333
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:28,303
<i>Soon she will come</i>
<i>and get you.</i>

334
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,210
<i>I saw her once.</i>

335
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:32,875
<i>She whispered</i>
<i>something in my ear.</i>

336
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:36,716
<i>She planted her voice</i>
<i>inside my head.</i>

337
00:42:38,155 --> 00:42:40,214
Stop!

338
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:43,089
<i>One day, her voice told me</i>
<i>to stop hunting animals</i>

339
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,287
<i>and to start tracking people.</i>

340
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:48,859
<i>She needed my help.</i>

341
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:52,630
<i>People come to the forest.</i>
<i>She marks them.</i>

342
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:54,864
<i>I make sure</i>
<i>they don't leave...</i>

343
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:01,941
<i>... until she comes</i>
<i>and drags them underground.</i>

344
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:32,699
Out of gas.

345
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:33,970
Nice one, Sean.

346
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:36,308
You knew how much gas
we had to get out of here.

347
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,371
What the hell's wrong
with you, man?

348
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:41,774
Sean?

349
00:43:48,258 --> 00:43:49,623
Where are you going?

350
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:57,563
Something's wrong with him.

351
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:58,932
You just noticed?

352
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:36,499
Déjà vu.

353
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:39,031
What?

354
00:44:41,245 --> 00:44:43,805
I have the strangest feeling
I've been here before.

355
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:47,476
I told you we came
from the other direction.

356
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:53,447
No, not on this trip.

357
00:44:55,225 --> 00:44:57,022
It was another time.

358
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,691
You're losin' it, man.

359
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:08,871
Fuck.

360
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:11,631
Shit.

361
00:46:01,725 --> 00:46:03,352
<i>It's raided my morning meditation</i>

362
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:04,917
<i>and my yoga...</i>

363
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:07,156
<i>my tent.</i>

364
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:21,266
Josh!

365
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:34,218
About time.

366
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:35,519
Look what I found.

367
00:46:35,592 --> 00:46:39,119
Josh, it's the missing tourist's
video camera.

368
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:40,959
You gotta see this.

369
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,891
- What am I lookin' at?
- Hold on.

370
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:47,698
<i>It's me.</i>

371
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:49,534
<i>It's raided my morning meditation</i>

372
00:46:49,606 --> 00:46:51,301
<i>and my yoga...</i>

373
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:53,002
<i>my tent.</i>

374
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:55,044
Watch this.

375
00:46:56,046 --> 00:46:57,445
What are you showing me?

376
00:46:58,415 --> 00:46:59,404
Fuck.

377
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:00,973
Shit.

378
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:03,076
Josh...

379
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:06,611
last night in the car
there was somebody else.

380
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:10,023
A girl. Listen.

381
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:13,290
Listen. She touched me,
and I felt this pain.

382
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:17,333
And this was in my chest.

383
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:21,127
Right here.

384
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:25,031
Can you hear yourself?

385
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:26,939
Josh, she marked me.

386
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,171
It's just like
in my grandpa's book.

387
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:35,077
What?

388
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:36,585
You think I'm crazy?

389
00:47:38,055 --> 00:47:39,249
No.

390
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:44,488
Okay, somebody tell me
what's going on.

391
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:48,492
Be my guest.

392
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:53,735
It's all in here.

393
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:58,835
A Native American legend
about a ghost.

394
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:01,377
One in the form of a girl.

395
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:05,779
She's supposed to protect
the tree and the forest.

396
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:08,409
And I saw her last night.

397
00:48:08,485 --> 00:48:10,385
That's beautiful.

398
00:48:25,135 --> 00:48:26,534
Hey!

399
00:48:58,135 --> 00:48:59,432
Sean!

400
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:26,261
There's a lake behind that hill.

401
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:28,059
Oh, yeah?

402
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,962
Let me guess.
Another déjà vu?

403
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,231
You wouldn't understand.

404
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:39,935
I understand you're not
telling me something.

405
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:45,806
Just go east, past the lake.

406
00:49:47,617 --> 00:49:49,312
That'll take you out.

407
00:49:52,122 --> 00:49:53,987
What, are you staying here?

408
00:49:56,393 --> 00:49:58,258
I'm gonna slow you down.

409
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:00,296
What are you talking about?

410
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:03,694
Sean?

411
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:06,500
Let me help you.

412
00:50:51,748 --> 00:50:53,443
The spirit marked me.

413
00:50:56,853 --> 00:50:59,083
And she's coming back for me.

414
00:50:59,156 --> 00:51:01,647
Will you shut up?

415
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:03,386
He's just tryin' to scare you.

416
00:51:04,995 --> 00:51:06,826
No, I'm not.

417
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,829
Can you pass me
my grandfather's journal?

418
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:28,447
"120 years ago...

419
00:51:28,518 --> 00:51:31,919
"a Native American girl
named Satinka

420
00:51:31,988 --> 00:51:34,980
"used to come into the forest...

421
00:51:35,058 --> 00:51:37,185
as if gliding on the moonlight."

422
00:51:38,562 --> 00:51:41,725
<i>"She was in love with the son</i>
<i>of the medicine man.</i>

423
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:46,097
<i>"But their happiness</i>
<i>was short-lived.</i>

424
00:51:48,738 --> 00:51:50,899
<i>"Pioneers entered</i>
<i>the forest that day</i>

425
00:51:50,974 --> 00:51:54,876
<i>with the intention of clearing</i>
<i>the land for their animals. "</i>

426
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:58,546
We're gonna rush them Injuns out
of our land is what we're gonna do.

427
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,913
Yeah, we should've done that
a long time ago, J.R.

428
00:52:00,984 --> 00:52:03,145
We're gonna have ourselves
a little Indian barbecue.

429
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:06,212
- Indian barbecue!
- What do you think?

430
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,621
Mm-hmm, that's right.
Let's go, Skinny.

431
00:52:08,692 --> 00:52:10,284
- Why don't you start there?
- All right.

432
00:52:20,871 --> 00:52:22,668
Satinka!

433
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:32,137
Damn!

434
00:52:33,383 --> 00:52:34,441
Stay down!

435
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:39,777
Stay still!

436
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,855
Don't cry.

437
00:52:45,929 --> 00:52:47,260
Oh, yeah.

438
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:57,598
<i>"The spirit of the tree</i>
<i>gave protection to Satinka</i>

439
00:53:57,667 --> 00:53:59,328
<i>and saved her</i>
<i>from the burning forest. "</i>

440
00:54:01,104 --> 00:54:02,833
<i>"But it came with a price."</i>

441
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:16,408
"One night, during a rainstorm,

442
00:54:16,486 --> 00:54:19,819
"something came out of the trunk.

443
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:23,484
<i>"It was the spirit of the tree that took</i>
<i>Satinka's form.</i>

444
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:27,360
<i>It went out to revenge against</i>
<i>the enemies of the forest. "</i>

445
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:44,404
People started to get sick and die.

446
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:46,779
And they still do.

447
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:48,750
The spirit brings their bodies

448
00:54:48,818 --> 00:54:51,184
down into a secret burial ground.

449
00:54:53,023 --> 00:54:55,651
Then he plants 'em like trees.

450
00:54:57,294 --> 00:55:01,663
He replaces every burnt tree
with a body...

451
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:03,130
the human body.

452
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:04,928
Nice.

453
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:09,097
Romantic, eco-friendly,
totally absurd.

454
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:10,400
I believe

455
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:14,341
the real body of Satinka
is still inside the tree,

456
00:55:14,411 --> 00:55:16,971
controlled by the evil spirit.

457
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:20,039
Come on, you don't really believe
this shit, do you?

458
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,545
I'm gonna lie down.

459
00:55:59,723 --> 00:56:02,021
Now, take a rest.
You'll feel better.

460
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,182
Josh?

461
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:07,421
I know where the tree is.

462
00:56:07,497 --> 00:56:09,522
You're telling me this now?

463
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:12,659
I think my grandfather took me
there when I was a kid.

464
00:56:12,736 --> 00:56:14,567
Why don't you try
forgetting it again?

465
00:56:14,637 --> 00:56:17,003
The tree and the rest of this shit.

466
00:56:17,073 --> 00:56:19,541
'Cause come daylight,
we're outta here. The trip is over.

467
00:56:20,677 --> 00:56:22,042
The tree's waiting for me.

468
00:56:23,513 --> 00:56:26,676
Look, I'm gonna go check
on Jennifer.

469
00:56:43,466 --> 00:56:44,728
Jennifer?

470
00:57:09,492 --> 00:57:11,289
Oh, shit.

471
00:57:31,815 --> 00:57:33,112
Remember. Where is it?

472
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:34,878
Where is the tree?

473
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,942
Where is the tree?

474
00:58:55,431 --> 00:58:59,162
<i>A medicine man can go</i>
<i>into somebody else's mind</i>

475
00:58:59,235 --> 00:59:02,966
<i>to explore his</i>
<i>most secret memories.</i>

476
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,075
I have to find that tree.

477
00:59:12,148 --> 00:59:14,912
We need to get into his mind.

478
00:59:14,984 --> 00:59:18,818
You are goin' to help me,
and then I'll let you leave.

479
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:21,618
<i>It's all in this book.</i>

<i>The witch lives inside of a tree.</i>

481
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:26,451
<i>If I can find that tree,</i>

482
00:59:26,529 --> 00:59:30,397
<i>I can cut it down at its roots.</i>

<i>Be careful. She marked him.</i>

484
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:37,703
<i>She is already a part of him.</i>

<i>You must sleep. Sleep.</i>

00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:47,338
Sleep.

488
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:18,113
Sean, it's me.

489
01:00:19,682 --> 01:00:21,377
You hear me?

490
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:34,157
I need you to tell me
where the tree is.

491
01:00:38,368 --> 01:00:40,495
Will you take my hand?

492
01:01:06,796 --> 01:01:08,889
Talk to me!
You have to remember!

493
01:01:16,139 --> 01:01:18,130
<i>I'm losing him.</i>

494
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:31,017
I came here before...

495
01:01:31,087 --> 01:01:32,714
with my grandfather.

496
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:36,088
We used to come here
together, remember?

497
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:39,322
This was our secret place.

498
01:01:39,395 --> 01:01:42,455
You loved hiding there
next to our tree.

499
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:45,796
Behind the waterfall.

500
01:01:48,838 --> 01:01:50,567
In a secret valley.

501
01:02:03,186 --> 01:02:05,518
I know where the tree is.

502
01:02:06,656 --> 01:02:07,816
Where?

503
01:02:10,293 --> 01:02:12,523
It's behind a waterfall.

504
01:02:12,595 --> 01:02:13,584
Good.

505
01:02:13,663 --> 01:02:15,221
You're going to take me.

506
01:02:16,532 --> 01:02:18,363
What about him?

507
01:02:18,434 --> 01:02:20,698
It doesn't matter.
She's already got him.

508
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:22,499
She's got his mind.

509
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:30,473
You're not like the rest of them.

510
01:02:30,546 --> 01:02:31,774
You must go now.

511
01:02:31,848 --> 01:02:34,681
I trust you, and
you're gonna help me.

512
01:02:35,818 --> 01:02:38,548
Remember...

513
01:02:38,621 --> 01:02:40,589
we will always be together.

514
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:47,923
Wake up now.

515
01:03:11,821 --> 01:03:13,015
Go now.

516
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:23,465
She's gonna tell me what to do.

517
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:28,737
I won't listen to her anymore.

518
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:36,976
I have to stop her voice.

519
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:23,938
No.

520
01:06:34,056 --> 01:06:35,956
Go away!

521
01:06:38,561 --> 01:06:40,620
Leave the forest!

522
01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:53,872
Leave!

523
01:06:53,943 --> 01:06:58,141
The spirit of the tree
took your mind!

524
01:06:59,648 --> 01:07:01,741
Like it took Satinka's!

525
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:13,889
We can stop this!

526
01:07:13,963 --> 01:07:15,362
I know how!

527
01:07:19,735 --> 01:07:21,225
Go away!

528
01:08:07,016 --> 01:08:08,415
Kill...

529
01:08:27,503 --> 01:08:29,937
Kill Satinka.

530
01:08:31,707 --> 01:08:33,231
Burn the tree.

531
01:09:17,753 --> 01:09:20,017
I'm not going to hurt you.

532
01:10:08,737 --> 01:10:10,295
I know what you want.

533
01:11:39,495 --> 01:11:41,588
The curse is over.

534
01:11:45,034 --> 01:11:47,525
You can rest in peace.

535
01:11:50,673 --> 01:11:53,073
It's not over.

536
01:11:54,443 --> 01:11:55,467
Yes.

537
01:11:57,012 --> 01:12:00,971
It was the spirit of the tree
that took your soul.

538
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:05,646
And it was using you
to avenge the burnt forest.

539
01:12:05,721 --> 01:12:07,018
That night

540
01:12:08,590 --> 01:12:12,048
I gave my soul to the spirit.

541
01:12:12,127 --> 01:12:15,255
I wanted revenge
for what they did to us.

542
01:12:16,765 --> 01:12:19,131
It was my choice.

543
01:12:21,303 --> 01:12:22,736
No.

544
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,164
No, that's not true.

545
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:30,438
Yes, my love.

546
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:33,504
I did it for us.

547
01:12:33,582 --> 01:12:36,176
Join me, and we will live forever.

548
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:39,487
No.

549
01:13:32,641 --> 01:13:34,302
Josh.

550
01:13:34,376 --> 01:13:35,570
Oh, God.

551
01:13:35,644 --> 01:13:37,373
Sean.

552
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,489
Talk to me.

553
01:13:56,331 --> 01:13:57,389
Go.

554
01:13:58,934 --> 01:14:02,927
Save yourself.

555
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:04,997
Josh.

556
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:16,645
No!

557
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:41,469
Run.

558
01:15:45,908 --> 01:15:48,468
My love, I did it for us.

559
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:49,841
...for us.

560
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:28,114
It's his time now.

561
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:53,557
No.
