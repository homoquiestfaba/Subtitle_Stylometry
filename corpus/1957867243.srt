(airy ambient music)

00:00:05,996 --> 00:00:09,163
(ominous piano music)

3
00:00:38,963 --> 00:00:40,919
(object thumping)
- The fuck?

4
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,359
Somebody help me!

5
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,743
Let me outta here!

6
00:00:48,379 --> 00:00:49,212
Olivia?

7
00:00:50,571 --> 00:00:52,512
[Game Master] Hello, Olivia.

8
00:00:52,513 --> 00:00:53,443
Who the fuck is that?

9
00:00:53,444 --> 00:00:54,899
[Game Master] While I do understand

10
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,269
that it may be frustrating
to see your brother,

11
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:58,859
don't let that distract you from the fact

12
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,026
that you spent nearly your
entire life with nowhere to run.

13
00:01:02,027 --> 00:01:03,129
Oh, my god.

14
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:03,963
[Game Master] Only you know what

15
00:01:03,964 --> 00:01:05,403
you need to do next, Olivia.

16
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,619
What the hell is she
talking about, Olivia?

17
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,993
You know exactly what
she's talking about.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,589
[Garrett] Where are you going?

19
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,423
What are you doing?

20
00:01:23,424 --> 00:01:24,809
You need to let me out of here.

21
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:25,643
Please.

22
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,673
Let me out of here! (pants)

23
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,340
I'd like to use my hint.

24
00:01:37,317 --> 00:01:40,234
(shutter whirring)

25
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,893
If this is about what
I think this is about,

26
00:01:55,894 --> 00:01:57,852
then you need to let it go.

27
00:01:57,853 --> 00:02:00,614
Okay, this is not okay.

28
00:02:00,615 --> 00:02:01,448
All right.

29
00:02:02,764 --> 00:02:04,266
(pants) Why are you ignoring me?

30
00:02:04,267 --> 00:02:06,269
You need, let me the fuck out of here!

31
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,769
Look, I'm not dying

32
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,020
because somebody can't
keep their mouth shut.

33
00:02:11,355 --> 00:02:12,188
No, no.

34
00:02:12,189 --> 00:02:14,099
No, no, I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.

35
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,069
I look, look, no, no, no.

36
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,239
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,289
You've been a great sister.

38
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,369
Look, I love you.

39
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,406
Look, I'm begging you.

40
00:02:22,407 --> 00:02:24,719
I'm begging you, please don't do this.

41
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,126
I begged you for years and
you never fucking listened.

42
00:02:28,127 --> 00:02:30,449
No, no, no, no, no, no!

43
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,301
Don't do this!

44
00:02:31,302 --> 00:02:34,559
(knife slicing)
(Garrett grunting)

45
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,599
Because of you, I fear boys!

46
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,849
(knife slicing)
(Garrett grunting)

47
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,949
You're supposed to be my brother, Garrett.

48
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:44,150
Brothers are supposed to
help their little sisters.

49
00:02:44,151 --> 00:02:47,579
(knife slicing)
(Garrett grunting)

50
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,633
Wait. (groans)

51
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,943
You're not the victim.

52
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,849
You're right about that, Garrett.

53
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,559
I'm not a victim.

54
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,153
I'm a goddamn survivor.

55
00:03:00,154 --> 00:03:02,716
(intense electronic music)

56
00:03:02,717 --> 00:03:07,717

57
00:03:07,869 --> 00:03:11,286

00:03:19,498 --> 00:03:21,040
♪ We touch ♪

59
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,806
♪ We break ♪

60
00:03:22,807 --> 00:03:25,473

(moves to dark synth music)

64
00:04:23,007 --> 00:04:24,749
Oh, hey, you got a light?

65
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,829
I'm sorry, I don't smoke.

66
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:26,663
Oh.

67
00:04:27,515 --> 00:04:28,348
Fuck.

68
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,583
Oh shit.

69
00:04:42,327 --> 00:04:45,577
(footsteps clattering)

70
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:48,449
(hand knocking)

71
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,669
(window whirring)

72
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,783
Hey, you got a light?

73
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,449
No, I don't smoke, sorry.

74
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,499
Oh.

75
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,972
Hey, it's you.

76
00:04:56,973 --> 00:04:57,806
Hey.

77
00:04:57,806 --> 00:04:58,639
What are you doing out here?

78
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,779
The meeting started like 40 minutes ago.

79
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,613
Does Brad need me?

80
00:05:01,614 --> 00:05:03,119
I can come in and help.

81
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,423
Shit, I shouldn't have
stayed out here so long.

82
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:10,963
Never mind.

83
00:05:10,964 --> 00:05:12,663
All right, I'll see you in there?

84
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:14,536
Cool.

85
00:05:14,537 --> 00:05:16,769
(somber ambient music)

86
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:17,943
Brad, I'm sick of it.

87
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,607
I'm sick of everyone telling me,

88
00:05:20,608 --> 00:05:22,293
no things are gonna get better.

89
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,529
They don't understand what it's like

90
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,719
to have everything you've
ever dreamt of having

91
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,450
taken from you in an instant.

92
00:05:30,447 --> 00:05:32,853
And I had the life I
always wanted, you know.

93
00:05:34,592 --> 00:05:36,239
I had the expensive car,

94
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,140
the dream girl,

95
00:05:37,141 --> 00:05:38,789
a roof over my head.

96
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:39,933
And now it's all gone.

97
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,793
Because I let this stupid
disease get the best of me.

98
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,659
I got nothing left to be grateful for.

99
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,549
You have a pulse, right?

100
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,553
Because being alive is
worth being grateful for.

101
00:05:57,868 --> 00:05:59,403
I just want my life back.

102
00:06:00,935 --> 00:06:03,389
Hey, can you believe this guy?

103
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:06,359
Look, I for one am so proud of you

104
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,729
and how far you have
come with your addiction.

105
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:11,579
And hey, it's not only me who is proud.

106
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,109
It's all of us.

107
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,159
Everybody, please come on,

108
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,342
let's give a round of applause for Travis.

109
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:19,485
(group applauding)

110
00:06:19,486 --> 00:06:20,849
Oh, come on.

111
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,083
Are you serious?

112
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,474
I'm sorry, is there a problem?

113
00:06:26,475 --> 00:06:29,669
Yeah, we get it, we're all
addicts with sob stories.

114
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,503
Boohoo.

115
00:06:30,504 --> 00:06:32,116
Victims of the system, right?

116
00:06:32,117 --> 00:06:34,859
(scoffs) No, we are survivors.

117
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,329
Survivors, right?

118
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,163
Sorry.

119
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:38,909
My bad.

120
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:40,019
If I'm not mistaken,

121
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,269
all you motivational speakers are frauds

122
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,619
and you just like to stand up

123
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,909
and waste everybody's time

124
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:47,060
because you wanna feel
good about yourself.

125
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,779
Well, it's very clear that
you have a lot on your mind.

126
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,759
So would you like to tell everybody

127
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,589
why you're here in the first place?

128
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:56,423
Why not?

129
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,849
Hi, everybody, I'm Jake.

130
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:00,683
Good to be here.

131
00:07:00,684 --> 00:07:02,126
- Hi.
- Hi, Jake.

132
00:07:02,127 --> 00:07:04,229
Hi, yeah, well, whatever that was.

133
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,809
Anyways, I'm a nobody with
no purpose and no heart,

134
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,579
just a fool that was left to rot in a cage

135
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,899
for about a year and a half.

136
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,183
So anyways, (blows) deuces.

137
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,439
Allow me to explain
something to you, Jake.

138
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,299
You see, we as human beings

139
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,969
are forced to live
inside of our own minds,

140
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,609
also known as an emotional
prison created by others,

141
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,919
leaving us with no other choice but

142
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,529
to try our very best just to fit in

143
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:30,869
all for a chance to feel what?

144
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,189
Accepted.

145
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,719
Remember this,

146
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,389
remember that with each and every day,

147
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,300
danger is real

148
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,833
and fear is a choice.

149
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,319
I'm sorry, you were saying
that you're a nobody.

150
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,250
Is that right?

151
00:07:44,251 --> 00:07:45,300
Yeah, that's right.

152
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,640
Let me ask you something.

153
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,603
Are you sure you're a nobody,
or do you just feel like one?

154
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,679
Go ahead, tell me what you
believe to be the truth.

155
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,513
The truth?

156
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,639
The truth is I'm a former drug addict

157
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,679
with nothing left to give.

158
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,591
Sorry, mom.

159
00:08:02,592 --> 00:08:05,424
(group chuckling)

160
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,049
I'm sorry, what is so funny about that?

161
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,279
Huh?

162
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,779
What is so funny about a man

163
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,149
who refuses to accept his potential?

164
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,979
I say it every single week,

165
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,259
once we decide to make
peace with our addictions,

166
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,359
it is then that we have the power

167
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,329
to make our reflections change.

168
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,399
And whether you realize that or not, Jake,

169
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,493
we all, including you,
have something to give.

170
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,479
Which brings me to a question
that each of us in this room

171
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,339
may share the same answer for.

172
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,173
Here we go.

173
00:08:37,325 --> 00:08:39,209
(somber ambient music)

174
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:42,100
How many of you have ever found yourself

175
00:08:43,734 --> 00:08:45,303
in a dangerous situation?

176
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,693
Show of hands please.

177
00:08:54,877 --> 00:08:56,308
Look at that.

178
00:08:56,309 --> 00:08:57,142
Look at that.

179
00:08:57,143 --> 00:08:59,433
We are all survivors of addiction.

180
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,699
And so am I.

181
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,619
As my struggle with codependency

182
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,679
has taught me such a very
valuable lesson in life,

183
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,269
and what that is is the fact

184
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:12,243
that power does not mean perfection.

185
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,053
People look at us as addicts all the time,

186
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,843
but never as survivors.

187
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,609
Okay, this feels like a
good place to stop for today.

188
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,139
So with that being said,

189
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,269
I want to thank you for being here

190
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:31,469
and thank you for being
survivors, instead of statistics.

191
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,969
Have a great holiday weekend.

192
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,499
I will see you next week.

193
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,733
Thank you guys so much.

194
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,929
Hey.

195
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:49,319
I might have been a little bit
awkward at the car earlier,

196
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,669
so why don't we just hit the
restart button, start fresh.

197
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,640
May I

198
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,599
offer you a bagel?

199
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,229
I made these myself this
morning, came in really early.

200
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,063
Had to.

201
00:10:02,064 --> 00:10:03,479
Excuse me, may I speak
to you two real quick?

202
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,833
Excuse me, no.

203
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,619
Of course, Brad, what is it?

204
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,699
Well, there's something I would like

205
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,559
for the both of you to be a part of.

206
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,823
No thanks, we're good.

207
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,613
Come on, Jake, could be fun.

208
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,719
What is it, Brad?

209
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,159
With the holidays
right around the corner,

210
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,409
there is no better time
for me to give back,

211
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,579
and to cut to the chase,

212
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,489
let's just say I was
contacted about an experiment

213
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:30,029
and it just so happens to
offer substantial compensation.

214
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:30,930
Wow.

215
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:33,809
Substantial, you say. (fake gasps)

216
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,613
How substantial?

217
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,553
Very substantial.

218
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,469
It would require three
people willing to participate

219
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:46,319
in an escape room based
around their addictions,

220
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,169
and you two seem like the perfect fit.

221
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,703
So what do you two say?

222
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,009
Are we getting paid?

223
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,449
Do we get gold bullion?

224
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:58,319
I accept cryptocurrency in
Bit coin, Ethereum, pirate booty.

225
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,629
You get more than a paycheck, Jake.

226
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,849
You walk away with a new outlook on life

227
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:05,459
that no rehab could ever provide.

228
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,859
Wow, he's not paying us.

229
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,783
Okay, well, either way, I'm in.

230
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,079
Okay, fine, I'll do your thing.

231
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,669
Wonderful.

232
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:20,009
So did you have anybody else in mind?

233
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,410
As a matter of fact, I do.

234
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,109
Meet me tomorrow at noon,
Serayah's Palace downtown.

235
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,399
All right, we'll be there.

236
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,629
Sierra, can you lock up for me?

237
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,039
I'm gonna give Matt a ride home.

238
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,363
Yeah, I'll get the keys.

239
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:33,749
Oh., Jake, before you go.

240
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,299
I just wanted to apologize
for how I acted earlier.

241
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,559
I shouldn't have made such a big scene

242
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,699
in front of everybody.

243
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,593
So again, sorry.

244
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,622
Good.

245
00:11:43,623 --> 00:11:47,939
(chuckles) You're reluctant
to accept my apology, right?

246
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,930
I get it.

247
00:11:48,931 --> 00:11:50,159
Okay, I do, I get it.

248
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,679
You're only here because
legally you have to be

249
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,293
and it makes perfect
sense, it really does.

250
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,473
What I am so passionate about Jake is you.

251
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,719
Yeah, you.

252
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,209
I am so passionate
about you because I know

253
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,669
that you can be a hero to these people.

254
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:11,789
I know that your story can be
someone else's inspiration.

255
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:12,623
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

256
00:12:12,624 --> 00:12:15,582
You don't know about my story, okay?

257
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,973
Nah, you'd be surprised by what I know.

258
00:12:19,767 --> 00:12:20,600
But here.

259
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,823
Cigarettes.

260
00:12:30,824 --> 00:12:33,029
What, you're a smoker, right?

261
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:35,633
Yeah, but I don't understand
why you're giving this to me.

262
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,206
You never know when you'll need a light.

263
00:12:38,207 --> 00:12:41,540
(ominous ambient music)

264
00:12:43,614 --> 00:12:47,669
(sighs) Of course,
no matches, no lighter,

265
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,413
could use a light now, dick.

266
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,200
You got everything?

267
00:12:52,201 --> 00:12:54,479
Oh yeah, sure.

268
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,433
Oh, hey, question.

269
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,679
What is it?

270
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,459
Your butterfly hair clip,
you just like butterflies,

271
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,623
or does it have like a special meaning or?

272
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,793
Yeah, it means everything.

273
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,443
I'll see you tomorrow, Jake.

274
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:28,949
I'll see you tomorrow.

275
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:29,820
See you tomorrow.

276
00:13:29,821 --> 00:13:31,679
Oh, you're good getting to your car?

277
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,603
I'll survive.

278
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:33,436
(Jake chuckling)

279
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:36,853
(light electronic music)

280
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,100
Portland's beautiful, huh?

281
00:14:05,101 --> 00:14:06,268
Yeah, it is.

282
00:14:07,543 --> 00:14:10,349
Hey, I was meaning to ask you something.

283
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,190
Sure.

284
00:14:11,191 --> 00:14:13,383
I've always wanted to host my own AMA.

285
00:14:14,535 --> 00:14:15,599
AMA?

286
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,659
Ask me anything.

287
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,059
Don't worry about it, it's stupid.

288
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:21,893
What's up?

289
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,869
I just noticed there was some

290
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:27,089
tension between you and Brad.

291
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,739
What's up with that?

292
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,529
Oh, nothing much.

293
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:34,229
He's just an asshole that thinks
he's better than everybody.

294
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,489
You know.

295
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,353
Or maybe he's trying to help you.

296
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,899
Maybe.

297
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,309
Maybe I can help him?

298
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:43,019
You see, I know a great surgeon

299
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,663
that can remove that
stick from up his asshole.

300
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:50,339
And with that, I'm gonna head inside.

301
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,173
You coming in?

302
00:14:51,174 --> 00:14:52,829
Nah.

303
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,539
I'll be out here for just a moment longer.

304
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,043
Just clear my head.

305
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,169
All right, see you in there.

306
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,003
See ya.

307
00:15:02,264 --> 00:15:04,931
(door shutting)

308
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,443
Of course.

309
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,713
Dick only gave me four cigarettes.

310
00:15:12,881 --> 00:15:16,151
(ominous ambient music)

311
00:15:16,152 --> 00:15:17,569
The fuck is that?

312
00:15:18,987 --> 00:15:21,904
(lighter clicking)

313
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:28,051
(Jake exhaling)

314
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:42,873
Hello?

315
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,469
Hey, anyone here?

316
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:47,789
Sierra?

317
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:50,009
Hi, I'm Roger.

318
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:51,127
Oh, what the hell?

319
00:15:51,128 --> 00:15:53,343
You must be Jacob.

320
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,373
Can you see me right now?

321
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:59,969
I can see everything, Jacob.

322
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:01,259
That's not weird or anything.

323
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:05,613
Listen, kid, I get it,
you don't wanna be here.

324
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:11,840
You could care less
about these escape rooms.

325
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:14,759
Seen a lotta shit, I bet, huh?

326
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,879
I heard you did a lot of time.

327
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,399
Yeah, I did like a year and
eight months up north over.

328
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,899
Well, listen,

329
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,289
I just got out of a 25 to life sentence

330
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:28,139
in a high supermax prison!

331
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,569
So if you wanna come at me with your

332
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:33,779
tough guy charade, then bring it!

333
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:37,349
Because I'll dig a grave so fricking fast

334
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,419
and bury your ass in it!

335
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,340
You won't know what fucking hit you.

336
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:48,380
And remember leave all
personal items, such as bags,

337
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,599
recording devices, cell phones,

338
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,139
lighters in the tray in front of you.

339
00:16:55,140 --> 00:17:00,140
And remember not everybody
gets a choice, but you do.

340
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,914
Good luck, Jake.

341
00:17:03,915 --> 00:17:05,189
(static whooshing)

342
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,963
Well, that just happened.

343
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,449
Oh good, it's you.

344
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:14,463
Always wonderful to see you too, Jake.

345
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,889
So I'm here for your
stupid haunted house

346
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:17,890
or whatever this is.

347
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,749
Well, what I think you
meant to say was escape room,

348
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,549
and the meeting room
you will be meeting in

349
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:26,129
will be down the hall
to your left down there.

350
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:29,399
So what do you want
from me, ID, anything?

351
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,979
Well, besides any bags, phones, keys,

352
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,199
recording equipment and or lighters,

353
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,089
the only thing I need from you, Jake,

354
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,790
is to sign this waiver right here.

355
00:17:43,477 --> 00:17:46,319
And you do understand that
with any type of experiment

356
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,199
comes potential risks
associated with the activities

357
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,639
that will take place here today.

358
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,929
Do you understand this?

359
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:54,280
Wait, this is a controlled
experiment, right?

360
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:57,676
Of course.

361
00:18:01,702 --> 00:18:02,535
[Sierra] Oh, hey.

362
00:18:02,535 --> 00:18:03,368
Hey.

363
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,119
Here's that waiver for you, Brad.

364
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,409
Thank you.

365
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:08,250
I'll see you in the meeting room.

366
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,093
Adios.

367
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,329
Alrighty.

368
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,549
You said the meeting room was down

369
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,229
this hall and to the left.

370
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,680
That's exactly what I said.

371
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,343
And one more thing, Jake,

372
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,923
not everyone gets a choice, but you do.

373
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,389
Hey, this is where we meet?

374
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:44,913
In here, where we are currently meeting?

375
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:46,643
No.

376
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,809
Ignore him.

377
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:50,073
Yeah, this is the place.

378
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:58,589
So did anyone else get greeted

379
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,663
by the Great Value Captain Spalding?

380
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,669
No?

381
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:06,503
Just me.

382
00:19:07,394 --> 00:19:08,227
All right.

383
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:12,899
(pencil scraping)

384
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,809
Wow.

385
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:16,919
Sorry, I'm not trying to be nosy,

386
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,890
but your sketch is incredible.

387
00:19:19,891 --> 00:19:22,109
Thanks.

388
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:24,693
So I had no idea you were an artist.

389
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,479
I've always wanted to be an artist.

390
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,829
Really?

391
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:29,663
Yeah.

392
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,343
That ended the day I turned 21.

393
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,469
Alcohol?

394
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,303
No.

395
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,113
Gambling.

396
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,243
All right.

397
00:19:44,244 --> 00:19:45,839
Who's ready to walk out of here today

398
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,759
with a new outlook on life?

399
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,593
Let's do it.

400
00:19:48,593 --> 00:19:49,426
Oh, we will.

401
00:19:49,427 --> 00:19:50,579
But before we get started,

402
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,699
let's cover the rules
of today's experiment.

403
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,939
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

404
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,883
Escape the escape room,
don't break shit, rules done.

405
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,569
If only the rules were that simple.

406
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:03,599
So today you will find yourselves
in various escape rooms

407
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,399
based around your addictions.

408
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,789
It will be your job to figure
out which room is yours.

409
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,139
When the door to the first room locks,

410
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,849
you will then have 60 minutes

411
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:14,219
to complete today's experiment.

412
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,989
If you get stumped, just yell out loud,

413
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:18,119
and our Game Master Michael will be there

414
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,919
to assist you with a hint.

415
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,539
But use your hint wisely,

416
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,763
as only one hint is allowed per room.

417
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:25,503
Any questions?

418
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,099
Wonderful.

419
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,757
Follow me to room one.

420
00:20:40,467 --> 00:20:43,800
(ominous ambient music)

421
00:20:48,344 --> 00:20:51,693
Welcome to the room of reflection.

422
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,719
Nope, this is the castle room.

423
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,069
No, as you see,

424
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:02,339
this is the room where each of
you will reflect on yourself

425
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:05,043
the most in ways you
have never done before.

426
00:21:07,389 --> 00:21:09,503
(chuckles) Sorry, that
doesn't make any sense.

427
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:12,873
I assure you it does.

428
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,993
Go ahead, take a look for yourself.

429
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:29,969
Wow.

430
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:32,253
The attention to detail
here is impressive.

431
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:35,069
Thanks, I really appreciate that.

432
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:37,799
I bet you're proud of
what you created here.

433
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,299
Yeah.

434
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,133
So proud.

435
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:44,853
What about you, Sierra, what
do you think of my creation?

436
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,983
Yeah, it feels special.

437
00:21:52,866 --> 00:21:53,699
It is.

438
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:04,499
I see you admiring our
shield of courage over there.

439
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,763
Shield of courage, huh?

440
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,089
I kind of like that.

441
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:11,489
Why, does courage mean something to you?

442
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:12,323
Actually,

443
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:14,543
yeah.

444
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,860
Yeah, it means everything to me.

445
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,033
Always has.

446
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:24,203
Good to know.

447
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:36,119
Well, this is where I leave you.

448
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,023
Best of luck.

449
00:22:39,837 --> 00:22:40,983
And one more thing.

450
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,280
I hope it was worth it.

451
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:49,068
(door thudding)

452
00:22:49,069 --> 00:22:51,419
What did he mean by "I
hope it was worth it."?

453
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,969
Sierra, it's okay, he's
just trying to spook us.

454
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:55,349
Yeah.

455
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,719
I mean, it's all just part of his whole,

456
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,089
the danger is real thing, you know.

457
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:02,489
He's just trying to
toy with your emotions.

458
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,073
Don't let him get inside your head.

459
00:23:07,394 --> 00:23:10,227
(voice screaming)

460
00:23:11,226 --> 00:23:12,689
What was that?

461
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:14,901
Probably Matt's stomach.

462
00:23:14,902 --> 00:23:15,735
Need anything, man?

463
00:23:15,736 --> 00:23:17,739
You need to eat some food, take a shit?

464
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,783
What, no.

465
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:22,859
[Michael] I'd like to
thank you all for being here,

466
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:27,569
as today marks the first day
of the rest of your lives.

467
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:29,789
In less than 60 minutes,

468
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:34,323
a winner will be determined
and the rest shall be history.

469
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:39,179
Focusing on the room you
find yourselves in currently,

470
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:43,499
it may be confusing as
to whose room this is,

471
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,927
but know that it does hold
deep meaning for one of you.

472
00:23:46,928 --> 00:23:48,269
(ominous ambient music)

473
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:52,139
Search the room for clues,
proceed as instructed.

474
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,849
Remember this.

475
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:57,089
Don't be afraid to fail,

476
00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:00,183
but more so, be afraid to give up.

477
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,319
There's something off about this room.

478
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,190
Oh, it's gonna be all right.

479
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:06,060
You're gonna be okay.

480
00:24:06,061 --> 00:24:08,761
No, seriously, I need to get outta here!

481
00:24:08,762 --> 00:24:09,595
(door clattering)

482
00:24:09,595 --> 00:24:10,428
Hey, what's wrong?

483
00:24:10,428 --> 00:24:11,261
We just got here.

484
00:24:11,262 --> 00:24:14,129
Yeah, is there an underlying
health issue or something?

485
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:16,019
I mean, there's nothing that's happened

486
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,443
to warrant this kind of behavior.

487
00:24:17,444 --> 00:24:20,189
(suspenseful electronic music)

488
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:22,319
I get panic attacks, okay.

489
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,549
And this is my first escape room,

490
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,767
I guess I'm just a little freaked out.

491
00:24:25,768 --> 00:24:26,909
Well, don't worry.

492
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:28,409
Escape rooms aren't meant to be scary,

493
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,779
they're meant to make
you just use your brain.

494
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,159
I am using my brain,

495
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,529
and my brain knows that
I have terrible anxiety

496
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:35,969
and I need to get outta here.

497
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:38,009
Well, tell your brain that
the worst thing that's happened

498
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:41,513
so far is that we saw
Brad's stupid face, huh?

499
00:24:41,514 --> 00:24:42,510
Huh?

500
00:24:42,511 --> 00:24:43,829
Seriously.

501
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,833
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.

502
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,020
I promise.

503
00:24:51,989 --> 00:24:52,822
Okay.

504
00:24:52,823 --> 00:24:54,655
[Jake] There you go.

505
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,663
Hey guys, look.

506
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,819
Why are we being filmed?

507
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,823
Just in case something
goes wrong, which it won't.

508
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:12,389
Plus these cameras are here
just to help us with our hints.

509
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:14,489
Holy shit!

510
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:16,289
You know what I think?

511
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:19,919
I think this is one of those reality shows

512
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,539
where they put the people
inside the building

513
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,949
and then compete against each other

514
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:24,363
for cash prize or something.

515
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:27,453
But this has nothing to do with money.

516
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:31,259
And money isn't everything, trust me.

517
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:36,089
No, but it sure as hell can
buy you a really great time

518
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:38,369
on a Saturday night in Tulsa.

519
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,869
What is wrong with you?

520
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,170
Depends on who's asking.

521
00:25:51,343 --> 00:25:54,343
(pencil scratching)

522
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,553
What is that?

523
00:25:59,687 --> 00:26:00,520
That?

524
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,656
That is a clock, genius.

525
00:26:04,657 --> 00:26:06,779
"Time heels all wounds."

526
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,613
What?

527
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,630
Oh,

528
00:26:09,631 --> 00:26:11,609
the clock and the bandages it's meant

529
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:13,593
to represent wounds healing over time.

530
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,843
Can I see it?

531
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:25,690
This clock doesn't tick.

532
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:28,739
Hey, what's that?

533
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,006
What does that say?

534
00:26:30,007 --> 00:26:31,507
"And then time stood still."

535
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,729
Well that would explain
the clock not ticking.

536
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:37,850
But what does this have to
do with any of our addictions?

537
00:26:37,851 --> 00:26:40,469
(sighs) Oh, that's what
we have to figure out.

538
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:44,470
(suspenseful electronic music)

539
00:26:54,907 --> 00:26:56,937
"Time to reflect."

540
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,673
What?

541
00:27:02,947 --> 00:27:04,469
"Time to reflect."

542
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:06,239
What about that chest over there?

543
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,170
What about it?

544
00:27:07,171 --> 00:27:09,565
Might as well check
it out while we're here.

545
00:27:09,566 --> 00:27:10,399
Okay.

546
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:15,539
(chest clattering)

547
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,490
Well, let me think for a second here.

548
00:27:20,616 --> 00:27:22,889
It's no coincidence that
there's two mirrors in here

549
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:24,659
and one of them says "Time to reflect.",

550
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:27,869
and obviously mirrors cause reflections.

551
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:28,703
[Matt] Yeah.

552
00:27:28,704 --> 00:27:32,669
So Brad said earlier
that this room was where

553
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:35,219
we would reflect on ourselves the most.

554
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,239
[Matt] Right.

555
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:41,240
So maybe we stand in front
of this mirror and we reflect.

556
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:45,323
Right?

557
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:48,753
Oh, what's that?

558
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,879
"There are 3 sides to every story."

559
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,619
Any idea what that means?

560
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,563
[Matt] Well, there are
three of us in this room?

561
00:27:59,133 --> 00:28:01,289
And the three of us are addicts,

562
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:04,040
and Lord knows every addict
has a story to tell, right?

563
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,219
I got it.

564
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,689
It's like Brad always says,

565
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:11,699
once we come to peace with our addictions,

566
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,339
we have the power to make
our reflections change.

567
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,173
[Matt] And?

568
00:28:15,174 --> 00:28:17,729
That still doesn't tell
us who this room is for.

569
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:18,563
No.

570
00:28:23,482 --> 00:28:26,489
But maybe telling our stories will.

571
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:29,399
Yeah, and if every room has something

572
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,659
to do with our addictions,

573
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,360
then maybe our stories should too.

574
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,150
Guess I'll start.

575
00:28:36,896 --> 00:28:41,643
(sighs) So I guess my addiction
isn't just to self-harm,

576
00:28:43,306 --> 00:28:45,509
it's an addiction to feeling,

577
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:47,549
that's the light way of putting it.

578
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,473
Feeling what?

579
00:28:48,474 --> 00:28:51,029
(solemn ambient music)

580
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:51,863
Anything.

581
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:02,673
My foster parents liked the drink a lot.

582
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,929
In elementary school I was diagnosed

583
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:08,343
with anxiety and depression.

584
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:11,339
Being abused by my foster parents,

585
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,679
my brother and I grew up with this

586
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:18,483
overwhelming sense of anxiety and fear.

587
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:21,693
I never felt good enough.

588
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,529
My brain constantly told myself I deserved

589
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:28,019
the pain that I was going through.

590
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:32,223
And to this day, anytime
things begin to overwhelm me,

591
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,130
the urge to cut comes back again.

592
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,813
So yeah, there it is.

593
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,779
Yes, my addiction is feeling like I need

594
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,030
to be the one in control.

595
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,849
Nobody likes to lose,

596
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:02,793
especially when it keeps
happening over and over again.

597
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:06,123
I've lost everything you can imagine,

598
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:10,353
from a six-figure paying job
to my friends and my family,

599
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,733
and especially the love of my life.

600
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:18,513
This disease takes your mind away.

601
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:21,749
It makes you feel invincible
until that feeling wears off,

602
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:24,213
which is almost instantly.

603
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:28,289
A long time ago I used to
tell myself that the addiction

604
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:30,959
to the thrill of winning is
not as bad as being dead,

605
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,579
but the more time that passes,

606
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,189
the more I second guess that thought.

607
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,749
All the people I've lied to,

608
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,609
all the people I've stolen from,

609
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:39,959
if you ask me if I would do it again,

610
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,059
I would be lying if I say I wouldn't.

611
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,260
You gambled with fire.

612
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,833
Damn right I did.

613
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:50,310
I'm sorry, Matt.

614
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:53,243
Me too.

615
00:31:01,533 --> 00:31:03,029
It's your turn, Jake.

616
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:03,930
What's your story?

617
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:18,271
Just so you know, I don't
have a addiction or anything.

618
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,503
It's okay.

619
00:31:19,504 --> 00:31:20,380
We're all in this together,

620
00:31:20,381 --> 00:31:22,803
and it's kind of the only way out.

621
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,330
Well, I guess what I mean to say is

622
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:34,503
I'm not currently addicted to something,

623
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,589
but I guess it's, as they say,

624
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:40,563
once an addict, always an addict.

625
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:49,529
I got caught up living a lifestyle

626
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:51,183
I really had no part of.

627
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:56,181
You say you lost your family?

628
00:31:56,182 --> 00:31:59,189
Yeah.

629
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,023
Yeah.

630
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,010
You're not alone.

631
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,789
I lost everything

632
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:13,503
because of my refusal to
believe that I had a problem.

633
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:18,183
And not just that,

634
00:32:19,893 --> 00:32:22,683
but that I was the problem.

635
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:24,993
Jake, it's okay.

636
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,870
We're here for you.

637
00:32:28,597 --> 00:32:31,829
You know, one thing led to another

638
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:34,323
and it wasn't just the
pills I was taking, but,

639
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:39,183
God, it led to the worst of the worst,

640
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:42,869
heroin.

641
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:44,970
Jake, your addiction doesn't define you.

642
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:53,200
That's so easy to say, but

643
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:59,463
you're not the reason that a
human being isn't here anymore.

644
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,823
I killed someone.

645
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:05,549
What are you talking about?

646
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,820
I have to wake up

647
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:09,970
every day

648
00:33:14,907 --> 00:33:17,863
with that black cloud
hanging over my head,

649
00:33:22,904 --> 00:33:25,109
knowing that I am the
reason another human being

650
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,890
isn't in this world anymore.

651
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,179
They found him in his
car in the parking lot

652
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,039
of some doctor's office.

653
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,389
Wait a minute.
(intense electronic music)

654
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,409
What?

655
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:39,179
I worked at a doctor's office.

656
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:42,329
One of my coworkers was found
overdosed in the parking lot.

657
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:43,919
It's probably not the same guy.

658
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,659
What was his name?

659
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,593
Ryan Fuller.

660
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,119
He was my coworker.

661
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,289
He was telling me right before he died

662
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:54,779
how upset he was over some
girl turning him down.

663
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,999
And I was the girl.

664
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,900
Wait!

665
00:33:57,901 --> 00:33:59,125
What?

666
00:33:59,126 --> 00:34:00,479
What, how was I supposed to know

667
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,479
turning him down would lead
to him killing himself?

668
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,149
Oh, okay.

669
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:08,223
So this Ryan connection can't
be a coincidence, can it?

670
00:34:11,436 --> 00:34:13,979
"There are three sides to every story."

671
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:14,940
While it's great we're all learning

672
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:15,852
new things about each other,

673
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:17,309
it still doesn't explain
whose room this is for,

674
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:18,959
and that's the most
important thing right now.

675
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,069
He's right.

676
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:22,259
We need to stay focused on why we're here.

677
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,839
So let's figure out whose room
this is by narrowing it down

678
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,369
to what we know already.

679
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:28,109
Well, none of us are
from the Middle Ages,

680
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:29,823
so I guess that rules that out.

681
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,149
History, medieval.

682
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,319
History?

683
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,249
Yeah, history, that's
the theme of the room.

684
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:40,319
Yeah, so I guess that explains
the Ryan connection, right?

685
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,079
It still doesn't explain
whose room this is for.

686
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,609
Question.

687
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:45,443
What?

688
00:34:45,444 --> 00:34:48,449
Have any of us tried opening this door?

689
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:49,410
You really think it's gonna be that easy

690
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:50,310
to open this door?

691
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:56,080
(door squeaking)

692
00:34:56,081 --> 00:34:58,168
Got it.

693
00:34:58,169 --> 00:34:59,533
Looks like it.

694
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,619
It smells like gasoline in here.

695
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,493
Yeah, it does.

696
00:35:09,758 --> 00:35:11,706
(door slamming)
(Sierra gasping)

697
00:35:11,707 --> 00:35:14,309
(door clattering)

698
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:16,709
Don't tell me, we just
locked ourselves in here.

699
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,550
Try the latch.

700
00:35:18,551 --> 00:35:21,179
(door clattering)

701
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,099
I think it's automatic, it won't open.

702
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,989
Shit, are you okay?

703
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,909
You look like you're about
to have a panic attack.

704
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:28,709
My chest hurts really bad.

705
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,543
There's a camera.

706
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:30,899
We'll just tell 'em what happened.

707
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,039
Yeah, we'll just tell them we need

708
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,689
to go into the other room.

709
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:34,739
We're locked in here.

710
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,119
Yeah, can you guys just let us into

711
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,770
the other room real quick please?

712
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,633
No, no, no, no, no.

713
00:35:40,633 --> 00:35:41,610
Why aren't they letting us out?

714
00:35:41,611 --> 00:35:42,869
It's okay.

715
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,669
Look, I think I found our way out already.

716
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:45,970
There's a door over there.

717
00:35:49,464 --> 00:35:52,709
(grunts) It's locked,
there's not a keyhole.

718
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:53,643
Of course.

719
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,710
Why don't we use our hint?

720
00:35:55,711 --> 00:35:57,569
They said we get one per room, right?

721
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:58,403
Good idea.

722
00:35:58,404 --> 00:36:01,109
All right, we're ready for our hint now.

723
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,333
[Michael] Nobody gets left behind.

724
00:36:04,812 --> 00:36:06,299
What kind of hint was that?

725
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,319
Stupid.

726
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,562
Hey, there's a key.

727
00:36:08,563 --> 00:36:12,230
(suspenseful ambient music)

728
00:36:15,297 --> 00:36:17,215
(gasps) Matt, are you okay?

729
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,261
I'm fine.

730
00:36:18,262 --> 00:36:21,656
I just (indistinct).

731
00:36:21,657 --> 00:36:23,099
(Sierra panting)

732
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,109
Hey, are you all right?

733
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:27,479
No, I feel another
panic attack coming on.

734
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,119
We're gonna get outta
here sooner than later.

735
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,739
Sierra,

736
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,090
just breathe than me, okay?

737
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:37,643
Like that?

738
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,283
Yeah, exactly like that.

739
00:36:54,422 --> 00:36:55,255
Jackpot.

740
00:36:59,137 --> 00:37:00,597
"The perfect match."

741
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,883
This thing is tiny.

742
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,489
I don't trust myself with tiny things.

743
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,240
You should probably hold onto this.

744
00:37:17,737 --> 00:37:19,536
[Matt Voice over] "Sometimes
you have to risk life

745
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:20,886

"and gamble death, to sacrifice life.

What's he doing over there?

750
00:37:33,124 --> 00:37:36,783
I don't know, but maybe
he slipped and fell again.

751
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,243
Fine, I'll go check on him.

752
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,254
Hey, man, what are you doing over here?

753
00:37:45,255 --> 00:37:46,409
(metal clanking)
Oh my God!

754
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:47,789
What the fuck are you doing?

755
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:48,660
I'm making the right choice.

756
00:37:48,661 --> 00:37:50,853
What the fuck does that mean?

757
00:37:51,907 --> 00:37:52,777
"Perfect match."

758
00:37:52,778 --> 00:37:54,111
[Sierra] "Perfect match."

759
00:37:54,112 --> 00:37:56,429
(gasps) Matt, are you okay?

760
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:58,649
Smells like gasoline in here.

761
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:00,209
[Sierra] Yeah, it does.

762
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:02,369
Okay, listen, listen,
listen, listen, okay?

763
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:04,169
I don't know what you
think you might be doing,

764
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:06,269
but whatever choice this might be for you.

765
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:07,589
It's not the right one.

766
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:08,423
Fuck you!

767
00:38:08,424 --> 00:38:09,539
Yeah, sure, fuck me, I get it.

768
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:12,059
The stakes are high, but
we need to work together.

769
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:12,990
I'm done with working together.

770
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:14,429
This whole thing is supposed
to be about our addictions.

771
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:15,629
Yeah, it is, it is, it is.

772
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,309
It is about our addictions
and our addictions

773
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:19,229
have only brought us
closer together, okay.

774
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,179
It's like the guy said
when we first got here,

775
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,399
we need to make today about the first day

776
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,509
of the rest of our lives, right.

777
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,669
We need to act like that, okay.

778
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:29,639
Now, Matt, please, please
hear me out, please.

779
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,890
Please hear me out, okay.

780
00:38:33,248 --> 00:38:34,469
You are a good person.

781
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:35,909
What would you know
about being a good person,

782
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:38,369
you killed Ryan!
- Ryan killed himself, man.

783
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:40,389
You're just as guilty of
murder, you deserve to rot!

784
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:43,532
Okay, sure, but whatever
choice you think that this is,

785
00:38:43,533 --> 00:38:46,529
what do you think that
that's gonna make you, hmm?

786
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:47,729
A winner.

787
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:48,563
Matt.

788
00:38:49,918 --> 00:38:51,209
(match clicking)

789
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:52,115
(ominous ambient music)
I'm so sorry.

790
00:38:52,116 --> 00:38:53,381
(Matt shouting)

791
00:38:53,382 --> 00:38:56,132

(fire crackling)

795
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,750
Somebody send help!

796
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:13,954
Someone's down here. (indistinct)

797
00:39:13,955 --> 00:39:15,038
Do something!

798
00:39:21,251 --> 00:39:23,918
(Matt shouting)

799
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,270
I don't think these rooms
were made to help us.

800
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:34,953
I think they were designed to kill us.

801
00:39:37,387 --> 00:39:38,220
Oh my God.

802
00:39:38,221 --> 00:39:40,352
(door creaking)

803
00:39:40,353 --> 00:39:41,999
(ominous ambient music)

804
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,739
If we're gonna get outta here alive,

805
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,359
we're gonna have to work together.

806
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,853
That means I'm gonna need
to be able to trust you.

807
00:39:47,854 --> 00:39:49,389
Deal?

808
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:50,223
Deal.

809
00:39:51,187 --> 00:39:52,270
Okay, good.

810
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:56,474
Did Matt really have to die?

811
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:59,909
We were supposed to work together.

812
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:02,010
That's what nobody gets left behind meant.

813
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:03,773
Yeah.

814
00:40:10,122 --> 00:40:10,955
My God.

815
00:40:13,093 --> 00:40:14,883
Guess this really was Matt's room.

816

00:40:57,282 --> 00:40:58,532
Where are we?

819
00:41:01,127 --> 00:41:01,960
Home.

820
00:41:03,666 --> 00:41:04,679
(door slamming)

821
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,929
[Michael] Hello again, Jacob and Sierra.

822
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:09,869
I would like to apologize for the demise

823
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:11,159
of your fellow competitor,

824
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:14,189
but in order for this game
to be taken seriously,

825
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:17,523
an example needed to be
set of what can happen.

826
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,733
This is my room, I
don't know what to do.

827
00:41:20,734 --> 00:41:22,301
Just breathe.

828
00:41:22,302 --> 00:41:23,609
You're not gonna get away with this!

829
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:25,919
[Michael] Oh, Sierra,
please settle down.

830
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,489
You said it best in the previous
room, he gambled with fire,

831
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:31,383
and for that he burned.

832
00:41:32,938 --> 00:41:34,510
I don't wanna be a part of this anymore.

833
00:41:34,511 --> 00:41:35,344
And you think I do?

834
00:41:35,345 --> 00:41:37,919
It's easy for you to
say, this isn't your room.

835
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,719
Please pay attention, Sierra,

836
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:43,049
as this room was designed for you.

837
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:44,879
For nearly your entire life,

838
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,829
you have gone through horrendous events

839
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:48,449
that continue to haunt you.

840
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:52,949
And for that, I offer my
sincerest condolences.

841
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:55,799
However, spending the
majority of your life

842
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,439
holding onto nothing
but anger and resentment

843
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:02,493
will leave you in a state
of never ending madness.

844
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,587
(door creaking)

845
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:11,453
Are you ready?

846
00:42:13,121 --> 00:42:14,563
Not really.

847
00:42:14,564 --> 00:42:15,897
It'll be okay.

848
00:42:18,781 --> 00:42:22,448
(suspenseful ambient music)

849
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,519
Hey, hey, hey, hey, calm down.

850
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,620
It's just a mannequin.

851
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:50,493
That's not it.

852
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:53,693
What's this?

"It's hard to keep a secret

854
00:42:57,757 --> 00:42:59,707
"when it's written all over your body."

855
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:06,479
What's in the folder?

856
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,039
What are you hiding from me?

857
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:08,910
I can't tell you.

858
00:43:08,911 --> 00:43:10,889
You can't tell me, really?

859
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:12,479
You just said it yourself
in the previous room,

860
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,430
we have to be able to trust each other.

00:43:18,906 --> 00:43:20,969
[Radio Reporter] It
is the 4th of May, 2002,

863
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:22,379
and police in the state of Oregon

864
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:23,909
have officially confirmed the deaths

865
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:26,219
of Jonathan Wagner and Elizabeth Bronson

866
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:28,829
as a result of smoke inhalation.

867
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:30,569
As reported in previous weeks,

868
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:33,119
the married couples' residence
mysteriously caught fire

869
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:36,329
during the late hours of April 22nd, 2002.

870
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:37,379
Their foster children,

whose names are being
withheld due to their age,

872
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:42,329
were found alive at a
neighbor's residence nearby.

873
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:45,179
Police say they had no
reason to suspect foul play.

874
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,759
Investigators believe faulty
wiring could have played a part

875
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,764
in this ongoing situation.

00:43:49,765 --> 00:43:53,098
(intense ambient music)

877
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:05,339
Jake, I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

878
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:07,502
No wonder you were
so quick to kill Matt.

879
00:44:07,503 --> 00:44:09,119
If I didn't kill him
he would've killed you.

880
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,739
You are a murderer.

881
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,749
Don't use that word!

882
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:13,769
I'm a survivor!

883
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:16,889
Oh, this is no time for
addict's anonymous catch phrases.

884
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:18,573
This is real life.

885
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:21,173
Where did you get that?

886
00:44:24,853 --> 00:44:26,339
We got it in the folder.

887
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:27,779
- Give it to me.
- No!

888
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:29,459
Give me one good
reason why I should even

889
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,709
consider the idea of trusting you.

890
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:34,139
Because you don't understand.

891
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:37,199
You don't know the nightmares
I had to go through every day.

892
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,650
What are you talking about?

893
00:44:41,606 --> 00:44:44,856
(solemn ambient music)

894
00:44:47,135 --> 00:44:47,968
Okay.

895
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:50,999
When I was born,

896
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,200
my brother and I were
given up for adoption,

897
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:55,893
we never met our real parents.

898
00:44:57,885 --> 00:45:00,089
You would think our adopted
parents would be our real

899
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:01,859
parents after living
with them for so long.

900
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:05,103
But they weren't parents at all.

901
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,100
They took advantage of me, Jake.

902
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:12,873
I was just a kid.

903
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:17,699
What kind of parents do
that to their own children?

904
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,349
And how was I supposed to know that

905
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:21,153
what was happening was even wrong?

906
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:28,083
The truth is, when me
and my brother turned 10,

907
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:30,393
we made a choice,

908
00:45:31,852 --> 00:45:35,099
a choice that for the
first time in our lives,

909
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:39,843
instead of being victims,
we were survivors.

910
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:44,693
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

911
00:45:47,757 --> 00:45:50,399
Can you please just give me the key?

912
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,550
I want both of us to
get out of here alive.

913
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:57,413
Yeah.

914
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,113
I trust you.

915
00:46:13,545 --> 00:46:16,212
(lock clicking)

916
00:46:25,277 --> 00:46:28,694
(ominous ambient music)

917
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:53,223
This was my childhood bed.

918
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,890
This was the only good
part about my childhood.

919
00:46:57,870 --> 00:47:00,029
This bed where I'd fall asleep,

920
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:03,363
and when I was asleep, I was free.

921
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:07,409
Being asleep was the
only time I could escape

922
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:09,869
the nightmares I was living every day.

923
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:11,129
Okay, I understand this room

924
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:13,739
has a lot of sentimental value to you,

925
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:16,259
but we are running outta time

926
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:18,779
and we still don't know our way out of it.

927
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:21,003
They got everything
about this room right.

928
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:23,729
That's nice.

929
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:26,129
Cool, great reminiscing and everything.

930
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:28,349
[Brad] Once we decide to
make peace with our addictions,

931
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:30,449
it is then that we have the power

932
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:32,763
to make our reflections change.

933
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:36,319
[Jake] Your a butterfly hair clip,

934
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,009
so you just like butterflies

935
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:39,783
or does it have a special meaning?

936
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:47,780
[Sierra] Yeah, it means everything.

937
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:52,781
[Jake] Hmm.

938
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:57,719
Did you know that butterflies don't

939
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:59,523
have pain receptors in their brains?

940
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,983
Meaning they can't feel pain.

941
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:05,133
No, I didn't know that.

942
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:18,000
Butterflies can go through

943
00:48:18,001 --> 00:48:19,803
a lot of pain and still survive.

944
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:26,699
I guess I kind of like to think of myself

945
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:27,963
as a butterfly sometimes.

946
00:48:30,795 --> 00:48:31,710
They just mean.

947
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:32,553
Everything to you.

948
00:48:32,554 --> 00:48:35,886
(romantic string music)

949
00:48:41,245 --> 00:48:42,824
(ominous ambient music)

950
00:48:42,825 --> 00:48:44,543
We should just focus
on getting out of here.

951
00:48:44,544 --> 00:48:45,899
Yeah.

952
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:47,009
Yeah, good idea.

953
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:49,289
Hey, think I see our way out.

954
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:50,123
Alrighty.

955
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:58,793
Needs a key.

956
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:01,649
Okay, so there has to be a
key somewhere in this room.

957
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:03,363
We don't have any time for this.

958
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,559
All right, I'll use my hint.

959
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,179
Good idea.

960
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:10,680
I'd like to use my hint now.

961
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:16,483
(playful horn music)

962
00:49:49,533 --> 00:49:51,889
(timer beeping)

963
00:49:51,890 --> 00:49:53,768
(ominous ambient music)

964
00:49:53,769 --> 00:49:55,019
Oh, I got it.

965
00:49:57,436 --> 00:49:58,739
Where did you get that?

966
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:00,089
Oh, Matt left it on the table

967
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:02,465
and I just grabbed it
when we left the room.

968
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:03,492
Smart.

969
00:50:03,493 --> 00:50:04,660
Yeah, right.

970
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:07,493
Do the honors.

971
00:50:09,627 --> 00:50:12,460
(lock clattering)

972
00:50:13,873 --> 00:50:15,903
(sighs) Here we go.

973
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:38,693
Oh, yeah.

974
00:50:40,478 --> 00:50:43,109
Yeah, this is my room all right.

975
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:45,850
This is an exact replica

976
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:49,053
of the cell I was in.

977
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:54,093
Same size, interior, everything.

978
00:50:57,090 --> 00:50:57,923
Honestly,

979
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:05,870
I feel like I should be
there right now till rotting.

980
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:10,600
[Michael] Congratulations on
making it to the final room.

981
00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:14,849
Jacob, the room you find yourself in

982
00:51:14,850 --> 00:51:17,729
is one that should be
all too familiar to you.

983
00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:22,683
After all a jail cell is a
place you once called home.

984
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:25,589
We're in this together, remember?

985
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:26,550
Yeah.

986
00:51:26,551 --> 00:51:28,889
[Michael] You took
away a human life. Jake.

987
00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:31,769
Each human has a story,

988
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:36,770
has dreams, a potential
to achieve a greatness.

989
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:38,673
Murder goes against this.

990
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:41,129
Try and help you out.

991
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:42,719
Thanks.

992
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:47,720
[Michael] You stole not
only a life, but a future,

993
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:50,489
a story in the making and all you

994
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:53,189
got was a manslaughter charge,

995
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:57,299
and you were released
in less than two years.

996
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:58,413
Despicable.

997
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:02,279
You never learned anything, Jake.

998
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:06,839
But today I promise that you will.

999
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:10,356
Oh, shit!
(kick smacking)

1000
00:52:10,357 --> 00:52:12,183
Hey, come take a look at this.

1001
00:52:16,057 --> 00:52:18,539
"Courage is the ultimate protection."

1002
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:20,999
Well, courage means everything to me.

1003
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,349
Where'd you find that?

1004
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:24,646
It was on the back of the safe.

1005
00:52:24,647 --> 00:52:26,343
I found this too.

1006
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:31,563
Closure?

1007
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:38,689
Well, there's stuff over
there, but we can't get to it.

1008
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:39,523
(Jake groaning)

1009
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:40,462
Hey, there's the door.

1010
00:52:40,463 --> 00:52:42,119
I bet that needs a key as well.

1011
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:42,953
Yeah, and I'm willing to bet you

1012
00:52:42,954 --> 00:52:45,175
the key to our freedom
is in this stupid safe.

1013
00:52:45,176 --> 00:52:48,700
(ominous ambient music)

1014
00:52:48,701 --> 00:52:49,534
Okay.

1015
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:51,300
Then we just need a four digit code.

1016
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:54,180
Right.

1017
00:52:54,181 --> 00:52:55,799
If we can get outta here.

1018
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,490
[Olivia] I'm a goddamn survivor!

1019
00:52:57,491 --> 00:53:01,253
(knife slicing)
(Garrett grunting)

1020
00:53:01,254 --> 00:53:03,878
(person screaming)

1021
00:53:03,879 --> 00:53:07,212
(ominous ambient music)

1022
00:53:11,835 --> 00:53:14,541
(door creaking)

1023
00:53:14,542 --> 00:53:17,209
(timer beeping)

1024
00:53:19,142 --> 00:53:19,975
Fuck you!

1025
00:53:19,976 --> 00:53:21,059
Hey, calm down.

1026
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:23,219
How am I supposed to remain calm?

1027
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:24,389
The people that are doing this to us

1028
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:25,889
know everything about us,

1029
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:28,139
stuff that nobody should
know at all, okay!

1030
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:30,809
They know your history, my
history, Matt's history!

1031
00:53:30,810 --> 00:53:33,299
For Christ's sake they
built an entire jail cell

1032
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:35,399
based on the one that I
spent a year and a half in.

1033
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,649
They designed a room based

1034
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:39,449
on the house that you burned down, okay.

1035
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:41,789
Today was supposed to be a fun
day where we could all just

1036
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:45,059
get together and Kumbaya and
better ourselves as addicts.

1037
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:45,893
But guess what?

1038
00:53:45,894 --> 00:53:47,373
Now Matt is dead because you.

1039
00:53:49,096 --> 00:53:52,559
(Jake grunting)

1040
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:56,163
Because he let his addiction
get the better of him.

1041
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:00,045
(timer beeping)

1042
00:54:00,046 --> 00:54:03,213
(light ambient music)

1043
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:05,520
What are you doing?

1044
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:07,433
Hold on.

1045
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,403
This is new, this was not in my cell.

1046
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:20,363
(door clattering)

1047
00:54:27,787 --> 00:54:30,057
"You never know when
you will need a light."

1048
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:35,972
A lighter, is this some sort of joke?

1049
00:54:35,973 --> 00:54:40,082
(ominous ambient music)

1050
00:54:40,083 --> 00:54:42,750
(timer beeping)

1051
00:54:44,070 --> 00:54:46,495
Now there's something I
hadn't thought of until now.

1052
00:54:46,496 --> 00:54:47,329
What?

1053
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:52,777
What happens when
the timer reaches zero?

1054
00:54:52,778 --> 00:54:55,229
(door clattering)

1055
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:56,759
Who are you guys?

1056
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:57,660
What the hell?

1057
00:54:57,661 --> 00:54:59,189
Haven't we gone through enough today?

1058
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:01,469
What are you talking about?

1059
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:03,839
I think she's just another subject.

1060
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:06,239
There were others.

1061
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,829
I just wanna go home.

1062
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:08,700
Well, if that's the case then

1063
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:09,660
why are you so covered in blood,

1064
00:55:09,661 --> 00:55:11,219
and there's blood on that knife?

1065
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:12,963
It's not mine, I swear.

1066
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:15,799
That's not what I mean.

1067
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,050
Then what did you mean?

1068
00:55:18,709 --> 00:55:21,719
I was forced to make
a choice that entailed

1069
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:24,119
either being locked in a room to die

1070
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:26,170
or to take justice in my own hands and

1071
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:29,403
take the life of my abuser.

1072
00:55:32,550 --> 00:55:33,630
Olivia, it's okay.

1073
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:36,509
I'm a survivor too.

1074
00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:38,489
Does it get better?

1075
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:39,869
Now it does.

1076
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:41,099
Wait, how do you know my name?

1077
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:42,899
Ladies, it's really great
that we're all friends here,

1078
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:44,459
but we need to work together and find

1079
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:45,539
a way out of this place.

1080
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:47,798
Are there any clues in that room?

1081
00:55:47,799 --> 00:55:48,750
(suspenseful ambient music)

1082
00:55:48,751 --> 00:55:50,369
Look over there.

1083
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:51,629
Maybe over there.

1084
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:52,799
Hey, that has my name on it.

1085
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:53,823
What does it say?

1086
00:55:59,970 --> 00:56:01,263
[Jake] Well, anything?

1087
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:04,643
Olivia?

1088
00:56:06,306 --> 00:56:09,359
(switch clicking)

1089
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:10,320
[Sierra] That didn't do anything.

1090
00:56:10,321 --> 00:56:11,418
[Jake] Try the next one.

1091
00:56:11,419 --> 00:56:13,469
(switch clicking)

1092
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:14,543
I'm sorry.

1093
00:56:14,544 --> 00:56:15,377
What?

1094
00:56:15,377 --> 00:56:16,260
What are you talking about?

1095
00:56:16,261 --> 00:56:18,279
Olivia.
(switches clicking)

1096
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:21,592
(timer beeping)

1097
00:56:21,593 --> 00:56:22,470
Olivia.
- Wait!

1098
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:23,303
Come back!

1099
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:27,508
Aw, shit!

1100
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:29,489
No, no, no, no.

1101
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:30,749
Use your hint or something.

1102
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:34,019
Yeah, I'd like to use my hint now.

1103
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:36,449
[Michael] If you can take
a life, you can save a life.

1104
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:38,579
I don't know what that means!

1105
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:39,599
We need the code!

1106
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:40,535
We need the code code.

1107
00:56:40,536 --> 00:56:42,003
The code, the code.

1108
00:56:42,004 --> 00:56:45,671
(suspenseful ambient music)

1109
00:56:48,192 --> 00:56:50,942
(Sierra sobbing)

1110
00:56:56,310 --> 00:56:58,619
Dick only gave me four cigarettes.

1111
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:00,443
Then we just need a four digit code.

1112
00:57:02,997 --> 00:57:05,664
(timer beeping)

1113
00:57:10,506 --> 00:57:11,339
Jake?

1114
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:16,723
Seven.

1115
00:57:16,724 --> 00:57:19,390
(timer beeping)

1116
00:57:22,491 --> 00:57:23,324
Four.

1117
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:30,479
Six.

1118
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,889
There was a.

1119
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:33,449
Shit!

1120
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,548
You said probably four?

1121
00:57:35,549 --> 00:57:36,382
Yeah.

1122
00:57:36,383 --> 00:57:39,049
(timer beeping)

1123
00:57:39,947 --> 00:57:40,833
Is it working?
- Goddamn it!

1124
00:57:40,834 --> 00:57:43,801
No, nothing is working!

1125
00:57:43,802 --> 00:57:45,048
Goddam it, fuck!

1126
00:57:45,049 --> 00:57:47,211
(object smacking)

1127
00:57:47,212 --> 00:57:50,143
(Sierra sobbing)

1128
00:57:50,144 --> 00:57:53,227
(solemn piano music)

1129
00:58:18,843 --> 00:58:19,676
Hey.

1130
00:58:21,910 --> 00:58:23,660
Thank you for keeping your promise.

1131
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:27,683
What promise?

1132
00:58:32,865 --> 00:58:37,019
That you wouldn't let
anything happen to me.

1133
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:37,923
Yeah, of course.

1134
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:40,193
I pinky sore.

1135
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:47,163
Jake, I need you to
promise me something else.

1136
00:58:48,810 --> 00:58:49,713
Yeah, what's up?

1137
00:58:52,590 --> 00:58:54,059
Promise that you won't take

1138
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:55,863
what's about to happen personally.

1139
00:59:02,186 --> 00:59:04,999
(ominous ambient music)

1140
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,000
(footsteps tapping)

1141
00:59:13,816 --> 00:59:16,816
(footsteps tapping)

1142
00:59:21,195 --> 00:59:23,925
(door clattering)

1143
00:59:23,926 --> 00:59:27,259
(intense ambient music)

1144
00:59:38,010 --> 00:59:39,029
Sierra, what are you doing?

1145
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:41,279
This guy tried to fucking kill us.

1146
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:45,149
I told you before all he
ever wanted to do was help you.

1147
00:59:45,150 --> 00:59:47,339
Hey, please allow for me to explain.

1148
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:48,899
No, okay, nothing you say will

1149
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:50,619
ever bring Matt back to life, okay?

1150
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:52,799
Okay, Matt, didn't die because of me,

1151
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,239
Matt died because of Matt.

1152
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:56,279
You can try and justify
murder all you want,

1153
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:59,180
but at the end of the day,
that's all you are, a murderer.

1154
01:00:00,810 --> 01:00:02,549
That's only fair.

1155
01:00:02,550 --> 01:00:06,659
But I like to refer to
myself as a survivor,

1156
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:10,229
a survivor of pain, a survivor of truth,

1157
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:12,179
a survivor who has lived to tell the story

1158
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:14,129
and published the book.

1159
01:00:14,130 --> 01:00:14,963
Jake.

1160
01:00:14,964 --> 01:00:17,733
Tell me, what do you see in this guy?

1161
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:22,099
This guy is my brother.

1162
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:23,879
(solemn ambient music)

1163
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:25,349
Being abused by my foster parents,

1164
01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:28,259
my brother and I grew up
with this overwhelming

1165
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:32,819
sense of anxiety and fear.

1166
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:33,873
Danger is real.

1167
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:38,009
And fear is a choice.

1168
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:42,033
When me and my brother
turned 10, we made a choice.

1169
01:00:43,230 --> 01:00:44,660
Not everyone gets a choice.

1170
01:00:44,661 --> 01:00:45,989
Choice.

1171
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:47,789
That for the first time in our lives,

1172
01:00:47,790 --> 01:00:50,493
instead of being victims, we were.

1173
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,039
We are survivors.

1174
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,093
Survivors.

1175
01:00:57,330 --> 01:00:59,279
Your brother, he's your fucking brother?

1176
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,679
Yeah, sure, kill me, I don't give a fuck!

1177
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,480
Give me this one little consolation.

1178
01:01:04,826 --> 01:01:05,798
What is in this?

1179
01:01:05,798 --> 01:01:06,631
What is in this?

1180
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:09,269
You want the code?

1181
01:01:09,270 --> 01:01:12,149
Yeah, I want the code
to the safe, please.

1182
01:01:12,150 --> 01:01:13,653
Sure, my pleasure.

1183
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:16,979
Code is six, seven, four, two.

1184
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:18,603
Go ahead, open it.

1185
01:01:19,541 --> 01:01:22,124
(safe beeping)

1186
01:01:23,322 --> 01:01:25,989
(lock clicking)

1187
01:01:27,416 --> 01:01:28,249
A DVD.

1188
01:01:29,430 --> 01:01:31,469
Is this some sort of fucking joke?

1189
01:01:31,470 --> 01:01:32,909
Not a joke.

1190
01:01:32,910 --> 01:01:35,860
It's what you've been searching
for for the last two years.

1191
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,523
Go ahead, press play.

1192
01:01:56,481 --> 01:01:57,481
Hey, Brad.

1193
01:01:58,440 --> 01:01:59,273
It's Ryan.

1194
01:02:00,330 --> 01:02:01,203
Oh, thank God.

1195
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:04,739
First off, I just wanna say that

1196
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:06,239
I'm sorry that I haven't been showing up

1197
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:07,990
to the Addictions Anonymous lately.

1198
01:02:11,070 --> 01:02:15,513
I'm just not in a good place
right now, or at all, really.

1199
01:02:18,162 --> 01:02:23,162
Last week, my dad, he lost
his battle with cancer.

1200
01:02:26,850 --> 01:02:30,400
And this week I just feel
like I'm losing my own.

1201
01:02:34,958 --> 01:02:37,875
I'd like to think that people care.

1202
01:02:39,713 --> 01:02:41,630
I know that they don't.

1203
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:47,489
The one person who I
felt truly cared about me

1204
01:02:47,490 --> 01:02:48,740
was my best friend, Jake.

1205
01:02:50,279 --> 01:02:52,329
But I soon found out what I meant to him.

1206
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:58,743
He sold me pills knowing
damn well I'm suicidal.

1207
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:05,210
I've made a lot of mistakes in my life,

1208
01:03:07,287 --> 01:03:10,533
but the worst is to come
after you see this video.

1209
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:15,779
It's like I told you
in the meetings before,

1210
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:17,279
we need to find a way for the others

1211
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,130
to have a new outlook on their lives.

1212
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:24,723
If you're willing to help
me, I believe there's a way.

1213
01:03:27,330 --> 01:03:30,363
Call it an experiment, if you must.

1214
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:35,043
Before he died,

1215
01:03:36,210 --> 01:03:37,529
my dad, he finished constructing

1216
01:03:37,530 --> 01:03:39,603
an escape room that never opened.

1217
01:03:41,310 --> 01:03:43,229
And I'm giving you permission
to use this location

1218
01:03:43,230 --> 01:03:44,673
as a way to help the others.

1219
01:03:45,959 --> 01:03:47,129
(suspenseful ambient music)

1220
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:51,269
Right, you start off small,
then you help the survivors

1221
01:03:51,270 --> 01:03:53,970
get the justice they deserve,
no matter how you do it.

1222
01:03:55,073 --> 01:03:56,923
You just make sure that they survive.

1223
01:03:58,020 --> 01:03:58,853
Okay?

1224
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:05,153
Look,

1225
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:10,773
I've sent you details in
the text before this video,

1226
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:14,699
and I hope you seriously
consider this, Brad.

1227
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:16,083
Not everyone has a choice.

1228
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:18,833
But you do.

1229
01:04:21,570 --> 01:04:24,513
Look, I'm sorry that I
couldn't be a survivor.

1230
01:04:26,941 --> 01:04:27,774
I'm sorry.

1231
01:04:30,909 --> 01:04:32,987
(DVD player whirring)

1232
01:04:32,988 --> 01:04:36,029
(ominous ambient music)

1233
01:04:36,030 --> 01:04:38,880
I want you to be assured
it'll all be over soon enough.

1234
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:43,215
Fuck!

1235
01:04:43,216 --> 01:04:44,049
(door rattling)

1236
01:04:44,049 --> 01:04:44,882
Stop!

1237
01:04:44,883 --> 01:04:46,289
What is wrong with you?

1238
01:04:46,290 --> 01:04:49,529
You've completely lost focus
of why we agreed to do this.

1239
01:04:49,530 --> 01:04:52,319
We agreed with Ryan, or so I thought,

1240
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:54,419
that we had an opportunity
to make people change

1241
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:56,069
and have an opportunity to see

1242
01:04:56,070 --> 01:05:00,899
the difference of their mistakes,
and we're not a statistic,

1243
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:03,749
we're survivors and danger
is real, fears is a choice.

1244
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:07,563
Oh, my God, Sierra, do you
really believe that bullshit?

1245
01:05:12,330 --> 01:05:14,122
I believed it because it was true.

1246
01:05:14,123 --> 01:05:16,186
(solemn ambient music)

1247
01:05:16,187 --> 01:05:17,969
The abuse, the trauma, the nightmares

1248
01:05:17,970 --> 01:05:20,370
we went through every
day, that was real for me.

1249
01:05:22,770 --> 01:05:25,739
I thought we killed our parents
to get away from the abuse

1250
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:28,349
that we were suffering,
not for fun or for money,

1251
01:05:28,350 --> 01:05:30,153
but because we had no other choice.

1252
01:05:32,253 --> 01:05:34,079
Now we do have a choice.

1253
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:35,519
It seems like you've completely forgotten

1254
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:37,870
what being a survivor is
supposed to represent.

1255
01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:41,573
You're right.

1256
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:45,119
You're exactly right, Sierra.

1257
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:46,892
Which is exactly why you need to kill him.

1258
01:05:46,893 --> 01:05:48,059
(ominous ambient music)

1259
01:05:48,060 --> 01:05:48,893
What?

1260
01:05:49,797 --> 01:05:50,640
I'm so sorry.

1261
01:05:50,641 --> 01:05:52,289
Your brother's a piece
of shit manipulator.

1262
01:05:52,290 --> 01:05:53,369
You don't have to do this.

1263
01:05:53,370 --> 01:05:54,627
Stay the fuck out of this, all right.

1264
01:05:54,628 --> 01:05:55,799
You don't deserve this.

1265
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:57,659
You don't have to do everything he says.

1266
01:05:57,660 --> 01:05:58,679
He's all I have, Jake.

1267
01:05:58,680 --> 01:05:59,699
Sierra, hurry the fuck up!

1268
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:00,533
Stop yelling at me!

1269
01:06:00,534 --> 01:06:02,129
You can be your own person.

1270
01:06:02,130 --> 01:06:03,899
Look, you've got five seconds to kill

1271
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:05,339
this asshole right now.

1272
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:07,169
If you don't do it, I will do it myself.

1273
01:06:07,170 --> 01:06:09,089
If you're gonna kill
me, then just do it,

1274
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:12,963
but remember, not everybody gets a choice.

1275
01:06:14,624 --> 01:06:15,541
But I do.

1276
01:06:16,427 --> 01:06:19,094
(knife slicing)

1277
01:06:20,767 --> 01:06:24,017
(somber ambient music)

1278
01:06:25,657 --> 01:06:27,957
It's like I told you
in the meetings before,

1279
01:06:29,070 --> 01:06:30,360
we need to find a way for the others

1280
01:06:30,361 --> 01:06:32,279
to have a new outlook on their lives.

1281
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:34,379
You walk away with a new outlook on life

1282
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:36,119
that no rehab could ever provide.

1283
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:39,479
I was forced to make
a choice that entailed

1284
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:41,849
either being locked in a room to die

1285
01:06:41,850 --> 01:06:43,559
or to take justice in my own hands,

1286
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:47,099
and take the life of my abuser.

1287
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:49,769
I'm a goddamn survivor!

1288
01:06:49,770 --> 01:06:50,620
I'm done, Brad.

1289
01:06:51,570 --> 01:06:53,339
The only reason I agreed
to these experiments

1290
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:54,873
was so I could help people.

1291
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,673
You did this to hurt people.

1292
01:06:58,587 --> 01:07:00,509
I'm tired of being a little sister

1293
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:02,360
that gets manipulated by her brother.

1294
01:07:04,235 --> 01:07:05,068
You were never a survivor, Brad.

1295
01:07:08,913 --> 01:07:09,746
I was.

1296
01:07:10,939 --> 01:07:11,872
(metal clanking)

1297
01:07:11,873 --> 01:07:15,905
(solemn ambient music)

1298
01:07:15,906 --> 01:07:18,678
(Brad groaning)

1299
01:07:18,679 --> 01:07:20,442
Michael, send down the key.

1300
01:07:20,443 --> 01:07:23,110
(keys jingling)

1301
01:07:31,793 --> 01:07:34,460
(Brad gurgling)

1302
01:07:39,210 --> 01:07:42,003
Hey, you saved me back there.

1303
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:46,867
If you can take a life, I can save one.

1304
01:07:49,801 --> 01:07:51,718
Hope it was worth it.

1305
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:16,573
(ominous ambient music)

1306
01:08:32,592 --> 01:08:36,175
(intense electronic music)

1307
01:09:02,489 --> 01:09:05,989
(dramatic ambient music)
