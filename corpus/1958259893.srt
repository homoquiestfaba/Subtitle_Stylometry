1
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,509
Shit! Let's try the other side.

2
00:01:10,949 --> 00:01:12,310
Get down! And turn that off!

3
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,932
Alright it's cool. That was the 5 a.m. drive-by.

4
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,365
Holy Shit! Will you look at this?

5
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:29,676
God damn it's beautiful!

6
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,545
It's more than I ever imagined

7
00:01:34,298 --> 00:01:36,545
I'm gonna go in the back and
see if there's any more

8
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:46,566
Whaddaya got?

9
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,724
Here, put these on!

10
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,754
Shut up!

11
00:01:55,498 --> 00:01:56,416
Come on!

12
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:00,138
- Over there!
- Where, Where? Right!

13
00:02:01,024 --> 00:02:03,600
- Oh yes!
- Oh yes! I think we got it.

14
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:06,326
- Nice!
- Grab it!

15
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,486
Freeze!

16
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,610
Hold it right there! Security!

17
00:02:19,184 --> 00:02:21,910
I said hold it right there, buddy!

18
00:02:25,077 --> 00:02:28,050
Security Eagle 1 to campus HQ...

19
00:02:30,581 --> 00:02:32,790
Two perps found in the dining hall.

20
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,270
<i>I copy that, Eagle 1.</i>

21
00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:37,130
Perps were nabbed for ingesting campus foodstuff.

22
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,840
I'm gonna make a sweep, then I'm gonna bring 'em in.

23
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,894
<i>Good work Eagle 1.</i>

24
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,928
- Hey Felix.
- Howdy.

25
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,024
You're up early.

26
00:03:27,205 --> 00:03:28,490
I'll catch you later.

27
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,358
- Morning officer.
- Morning.

28
00:03:34,874 --> 00:03:38,190
I wanted to tell you, your front tire looks
kinda low, you might wanna get it checked out!

29
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,505
Thanks, thanks a lot.

30
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,884
- Alright, you boys have a good day now, okay?
- You too.

31
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,113
What are you standing here all mopey for?

32
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,252
What are you talking about?

33
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,196
You're just kind of bland.

34
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,594
We just started talking.

35
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,445
Right, right...

36
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,550
Have you talked to Matt and Grogan yet?

37
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,185
They're not accepting my calls.

38
00:05:03,818 --> 00:05:04,990
They're pissed!

39
00:05:05,002 --> 00:05:07,220
Hey it's their fault for getting caught!

40
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,370
Well don't worry. They're not gonna squeal.

41
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,840
Alright, well here comes Grogan.
Let's talk about something else!

42
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:16,130
- What should we talk about?
- I dunno, something else.

43
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,030
- I dunno what to talk about.
- Talk about sports.

44
00:05:18,048 --> 00:05:19,034
What do you know about sports?

45
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,918
- Hello Zach.
- Hi, Grogan!

46
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,840
Hi assface!

47
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,260
Hey don't be mad at me!

48
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,345
It's not my fault
you're not smooth and nimble.

49
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,329
Smooth and nimble, huh?

50
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,800
Take it back!

51
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,297
Hey smooth guy, who was that
you were talkin' to over there?

52
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,154
That's your friend, Matt...

53
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,438
The other guy you douched!

54
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,262
Behind Matt, talkin' to Emily?

55
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,570
That's my lawyer.

56
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,197
Huh?

57
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,230
She's my student lawyer.

58
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,140
Don't you wish you got caught?

59
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:54,172
She's gonna defend us.

60
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,160
- Suzanne McKenna?
- Yeah.

61
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,817
McKenna... I've seen her before.
You know her?

62
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,790
Sort of, she's friends with Emily.

63
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,550
So am I, how come
I don't know her?

64
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:08,096
She transferred in sophomore year,
doesn't go out much, into her studies...

65
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,649
What does she do?

66
00:06:09,859 --> 00:06:10,859
What do you mean "what does she do?"...

67
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,924
Like uh... <i>do</i> do?

68
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,532
Like, besides being dickhead's lawyer.

69
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,920
Oh like, does she play sports,
is she student council president, that kinda do?

70
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,329
Yeah that kinda do.

71
00:06:22,005 --> 00:06:23,824
She's student council president.

72
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:25,990
- Is she really?
- Yeah!

73
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,949
- Did you vote for her?
- No

74
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,380
Well who did you vote for?

75
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:34,870
What's the difference? It's just a bunch of
old white men, legislating my uterus anyway.

76
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,374
I gotta talk to her!

77
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,729
I dunno... Look at that goon she's with.

78
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,604
Yeah, who is that guy?

79
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,396
I think he's student council's treasurer.

80
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:54,844
Oops, sorry.

81
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,596
- You dropped your cup.
- Thanks.

82
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,901
You dropped your cup again.

83
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,710
Oops, sorry, I'm sorry!

84
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,474
Excuse me?

85
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,993
I- I'm sorry, I dropped
my cup on your feet.

86
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,966
Oh don't worry about it.

87
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:12,705
Hey what's your name again?

88
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:14,380
Suzanne.

89
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:24,534
Traci, this is Fred.
You're Fred Peterson, right?

90
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:28,134
Uh no. Suzanne, this is Felix Bean.

91
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,432
- Hi Felix.
- Hey Emily.

92
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,018
I must have you mixed up
with someone else.

93
00:07:33,232 --> 00:07:34,610
Yeah I guess so.

94
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,000
I have to go to the bathroom.

95
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,110
- Yeah sure.
- You wanna go, Em?

96
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,434
Yeah, sure.

97
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,820
Okay, see you later.

98
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,220
See you around.

99
00:08:02,053 --> 00:08:02,980
Hey Felix.

100
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,113
Hey, how you guys doin'?

101
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:08,549
It's like waiting in line
for space mountain.

102
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,505
<i>"In Russia!"</i>

103
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,806
So, how does it feel
to rule the school?

104
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,438
What?

105
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,014
You know, "rule the school"?

106
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,500
Pretty good I guess.

107
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,756
Yeah, you know I was gonna run,
but I'm pretty busy and all, so...

108
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,478
Yeah, I bet.

109
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:34,416
- Lambchop!
- Wazza wazza!

110
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:45,436
How much will you give me if I hug
the next guy that comes out of the bathroom?

111
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,342
Really, how much?
No matter who it is.

112
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,730
How much will I give you?
A dollar.

113
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,160
A dollar? C'mon you gotta
give me more than a buck!

114
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,136
- You won't do it
- I will...

115
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,494
- C'mon, five dollars.
- Three!

116
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,554
Alright fine.

117
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,505
Three dollars if I embrace the
next guy that comes out of that door right there.

118
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,612
I'm gonna do it.

119
00:09:10,496 --> 00:09:11,490
Fine.

120
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,050
The fuck are you doin' man?
Get off me!

121
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,270
What? I thought you were my coach.

122
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,252
Get outta here.

123
00:09:25,914 --> 00:09:27,800
- Hey Emily.
- Hey Felix.

124
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:28,988
What do you got goin'?

125
00:09:29,296 --> 00:09:32,208
Uh nothin'. I have
medieval issues in a few minutes, but...

126
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,664
I'm gonna stop by the mail room first.

127
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,716
Cool, me too.

128
00:09:35,754 --> 00:09:36,820
"Medieval issues," what's that?

129
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:40,192
Stuff about axe fights
and grog and that kinda thing?

130
00:09:40,202 --> 00:09:42,154
No, actually...

131
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:47,330
It's gender issues in medieval times
with Professor Brancoli. She's awesome!

132
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:50,678
Hey, are you comin' to
the Aurora Borealis party tonight?

133
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,710
I don't know.

134
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,140
Um... is anything gonna happen
this year or are we gonna...

135
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:59,760
sit around, staring up at
the sky like we did last year?

136
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,870
Emily, it's the northern lights...

137
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,953
The sky's gonna turn blue,
and red... and green.

138
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,217
- It's astronomical!
- I'll bet it is.

139
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:12,385
I suppose you want
me to bring Suzanne?

140
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,300
- Suzanne who?
- "Suzanne who"?

141
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,329
- Forget it then!
- What?

142
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,868
Nothing, I guess you
don't like Suzanne McKenna.

143
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:23,356
- The student council president?
- Yeah.

144
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,490
What's happenin' 'Lix?
Cool got to be!

145
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:35,730
Freaky Reaky! What's the word?

146
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,412
Girdy birdy babe, girdy bird.

147
00:10:38,762 --> 00:10:40,350
Hold on, jellybean.

148
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:42,918
One more for the road.

149
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,782
That one's on the house.

150
00:10:45,856 --> 00:10:47,020
Thanks Freaky!

151
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,233
Hey Emily... Oh my brown-eyed beauty.

152
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,398
Another letter from mama.

153
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,800
Hi Freaky.

154
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,993
A little late on that credit card bill, sugar
don't wanna mess with the credit man!

155
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,477
Thanks Freaky!

156
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:16,572
So why would you think I was
interested in Suzanne McKenna?

157
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,366
No reason. I guess I got bad information.

158
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,918
Who told you that, Zach?

159
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,618
Felix, don't worry about it.

160
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,625
If you don't like her, you don't like her.

161
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,604
Who's the ape?

162
00:11:27,168 --> 00:11:28,906
- What ape?
- "What ape"...

163
00:11:28,912 --> 00:11:30,950
That ape she was hanging with on Saturday.

164
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:37,052
Oh, that ape! That is Suzanne's
high school boyfriend. He goes to Peck.

165
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:42,668
But just between you and me...
They've been having some problems lately.

166
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:48,440
Keep it hush, because a
lot of people died for that information.

167
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:51,536
Thanks. So are you guys
gonna be able to make it tonight or no?

168
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,408
- Yeah, we'll be there.
- Lush!

169
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,990
I may be a little late though.
I have play rehearsal.

170
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,444
- For what?
- A woman's theater group.

171
00:11:59,189 --> 00:12:00,960
A womens' theater group?
What's up with that?

172
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:06,010
Look, I decided to get a little bit more
involved on campus, try some things out...

173
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,425
But no... dudes??

174
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,420
It's liberating Felix, you don't have to
put up with all the bullshit.

175
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,100
Anyway, I gotta go.
We'll see you around eleven.

176
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,038
What bullshit?

177
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,204
Why aren't you talkin' to her?

178
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,812
I'm gonna. I'm just
waiting for the right time.

179
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,982
What do you mean "the right time"?

180
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,372
<i>Where the hell is this thing?</i>

181
00:12:32,117 --> 00:12:36,430
It's coming, I think
I see the first signs of it now.

182
00:12:37,765 --> 00:12:38,668
Look up!

183
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:42,166
<i>Oh yeah, I think I see somethin'!</i>

184
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,961
- Hey
- Hey!

185
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,758
Felix, I don't think anything's happening!

186
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,846
It'll happen!
Don't worry, I'm on top of it.

187
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,585
On top of the Aurora Borealis?

188
00:12:56,133 --> 00:12:57,900
Oh I thought you meant... Suzanne.

189
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,793
- Hey!
- Hey!

190
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,689
I promise not to drop
a cup on your feet this time.

191
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,586
What?

192
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,897
Remember? On Saturday night?
I dropped a cup on your feet?

193
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,152
You called me Fred Petersen...

194
00:13:17,162 --> 00:13:20,460
Oh right, Fred Petersen!

195
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:24,700
I'm sorry about that. You just reminded me
of this really dorky guy in my chem class.

196
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:29,052
I mean... not that you're a dork...

197
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:36,134
So... What's this thing
supposed to look like anyway?

198
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:40,780
It's gonna be one of the
coolest things you'll ever see in your life.

199
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:45,089
The sky's gonna turn red and
blue and green with streaks of light.

200
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:50,250
See, the light deflects off
the water molecules in the clouds...

201
00:13:50,266 --> 00:13:52,920
and that sends it off in
different directions at different speeds

202
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,740
Yeah, I think Fred Peterson
told me about this once.

203
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,610
So... You're saying I'm a dork?

204
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:05,580
You know, there are a lot of cool people at
this school who you probably labeled as dorks,

205
00:14:05,749 --> 00:14:07,050
Felix Bean.

206
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:10,001
Hey look, I don't have
any problem with dorks.

207
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:14,172
<i>- Felix, this is bullshit, we're outta here.
- Ah I swear I saw somethin'!</i>

208
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,022
<i>Counselor!</i>

209
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,150
What's up?

210
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,798
Not much, aside from
her calling me a dork.

211
00:14:24,266 --> 00:14:26,590
- You called Felix a dork?
- No!

212
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,569
I just said that he reminded
me of Fred Peterson.

213
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,780
Fred Peterson's a dork.

214
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,472
I know, okay?

215
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,438
Okay so... besides the dork thing,
are you guys hitting it off?

216
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:39,861
What do you mean?

217
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,106
Easy tiger. She already knows.

218
00:14:42,656 --> 00:14:43,590
Knows what?

219
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,308
- Emily!
- Jeez! Just greasing the wheels a bit.

220
00:14:47,802 --> 00:14:49,390
You guys are so silly!

221
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,982
I'm sorry about that.

222
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:59,766
Look, I dunno what you've heard but
it's not like I like you or anything.

223
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:04,048
- Okay..
- I mean... it's not that I don't like you.

224
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,404
I mean I really don't even know you
so how could I like you, right?

225
00:15:08,384 --> 00:15:09,060
Right.

226
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:13,590
I'll see you later.

227
00:15:17,769 --> 00:15:18,746
How'd it go?

228
00:15:19,808 --> 00:15:21,680
Uh... Pretty well.

229
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:25,724
First she called me a dork, and then
I told her I didn't like her, so...

230
00:15:26,037 --> 00:15:27,590
Good start!

231
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:30,301
You know...

232
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:33,452
There're plenty of fish
in this puddle. I mean...

233
00:15:34,565 --> 00:15:36,830
Maybe your bait's
just not tasty enough.

234
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:41,180
Oh I'll show you tasty bait!

235
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,022
Good evening and welcome to the Leather Fish.

236
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,668
Tonight our specials are as follows...

237
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:55,564
We have an herb crusted chicken breast with
basil and fresh sundried tomatoes. I recommend it.

238
00:15:55,810 --> 00:16:01,617
We also have a fresh halibut with fresh thyme and
fresh coriander, sauteed in a fresh leek sauce.

239
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,233
Also very good.

240
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,276
And the soup of the day...

241
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:10,362
We have a... a fresh...

242
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:15,640
fresh...

243
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,940
Oh that's okay, I don't think
I'll be having the soup.

244
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,142
I got it.

245
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,830
You know... I don't think I'll
be having the soup either.

246
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,520
Fresh... something...

247
00:16:23,536 --> 00:16:25,760
Well, I think we'll need
a few minutes anyway.

248
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:26,501
... corn!

249
00:16:26,768 --> 00:16:28,950
- Corn soup?
- Corn soup.

250
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,392
- Is it fresh?
- Very fresh.

251
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,337
I'll give you a few minutes.

252
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:43,329
I think that guy's in my
gender issues of the wild west class.

253
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,105
- So you're Matt and Grogan's lawyer.
- Yeah.

254
00:16:49,535 --> 00:16:52,190
I'm doing that for
court litigation class. Pre-law.

255
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,334
Wait a minute, I mean,
can't you just pardon them?

256
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:56,673
What do you mean?

257
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,849
I mean, isn't that part of your powers?

258
00:16:59,189 --> 00:17:00,010
What?

259
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:04,117
Oh I- I didn't mean to be out of line...

260
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,537
I hope I'm not suggesting anything unethical...

261
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,622
What are you gonna have?

262
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:17,057
I think I'm gonna get
the grilled vegetable plate.

263
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,680
You a vegetarian?

264
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,016
Yeah, but I eat chicken and fish.

265
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:25,580
Well, I hear they have
a wonderful mahi-mahi pot pie.

266
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:29,984
I don't know, I've never
been to this restaurant before.

267
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,061
Really?

268
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,932
Well, I guess you're
too busy running things and all.

269
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,942
Running what?

270
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,180
The school.

271
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,169
Running the school?

272
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,457
Yeah, you know... the presidency.

273
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:45,633
Yeah, I have no idea what you're talking about.

274
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:48,037
What do you think I'm president <i>of</i>?

275
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,042
The school.

276
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,329
Who told you that?

277
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:58,289
Well, have we decided?

278
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:00,682
What?

279
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:03,132
Have we decided?

280
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,292
Um yeah, I'll have the soup.

281
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:06,358
Very good.

282
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:07,772
That's a joke.

283
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,126
I don't get it.
What? You don't like corn?

284
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,556
No, I do it's...

285
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:15,969
I'll actually just have
the grilled vegetable plate.

286
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,510
Do you want me to hold the corn?

287
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:18,950
No, no, I like corn.

288
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:22,800
That was just a joke, because before
you couldn't remember what today's soup was.

289
00:18:23,626 --> 00:18:27,550
Well, I just started working here and
it's a little bit hard to remember everything!

290
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,537
No, you don't understand,
I was just joking.

291
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,540
What do you want?

292
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:34,625
I was actually thinking,
I might try the soup.

293
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:37,964
HA, HA, HA... That's very funny!

294
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,110
You know, if you guys aren't happy with
the service I can call the manager.

295
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,330
Mr. Santos!

296
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,518
No really, I want the soup.

297
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,313
Okay, I'm stupid, alright?

298
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,937
I'm sorry I don't
get your private little joke.

299
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:53,718
Mr. Santos!

300
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,982
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

301
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,980
She's got a boyfriend, but
she went on a date with you?

302
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,364
Well, yeah. But he goes to another school so...

303
00:19:03,269 --> 00:19:04,660
How long has she been with him?

304
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,990
I dunno. Supposedly like
four years, back from high school.

305
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,948
Now, he's a big boy, if I remember.

306
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:13,350
Football player?

307
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,241
Rugby.

308
00:19:14,336 --> 00:19:15,430
Yikes!

309
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:18,410
So you're gonna be buyin' some new runnin' shoes!

310
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,340
You must be forgetting
that I'm a bad motherfucker.

311
00:19:22,357 --> 00:19:23,749
Right, right, right...

312
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:27,280
Anyway, she says they've got one of those
seeing other people types of agreements so...

313
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:30,161
Oh! So you're playing Mr. Backdoor Charlie.

314
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,969
- Well, not really.
Backdoor! Man, Felix, I've seen it before.

315
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:38,689
You'll see her for a few weeks,
you'll have a great time... Probably no sex.

316
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,730
And then one day
she'll say she's gonna go visit...

317
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,960
- What's his name?
- Traci.

318
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,046
Tracy?

319
00:19:47,882 --> 00:19:50,230
Woof... dude with a chick's name, huh?

320
00:19:50,245 --> 00:19:53,408
Yeah, T-R-A-C-I.

321
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:55,952
- T- Traci with an "I"?
- Yeah!

322
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,050
That's tough!

323
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,534
Do you know what his last name is?

324
00:19:59,376 --> 00:20:00,300
Shannon.

325
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:04,412
- No! "Traci Shannon"? "Traci Shannon"?
- Yeah

326
00:20:05,354 --> 00:20:10,460
So not only is that name a firstie-firstie,
It's a firstie-firstie, girly-girly.

327
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,981
- That it is.
- That's weird.

328
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,196
So anyway, here's how it's gonna go.

329
00:20:15,461 --> 00:20:19,580
She's gonna say, "I'm just gonna go up there for
the weekend, because I haven't seen him in a while..."

330
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:20,960
"And we're still friends."

331
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,881
And you're gonna say "Sure, sure, that's cool.
It's not like <i>we're</i> goin' out or anything"

332
00:20:25,152 --> 00:20:27,400
- And then she's gonna say...
- Shut your pie-hole Zach.

333
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:31,489
- No, she's not gonna say: "Shut your pie-hole Zach"
- No, I'm saying shut your pie-hole Zach.

334
00:20:58,529 --> 00:21:01,580
"ROOMMATE WANTED, MUST BE NEAT

335
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:04,660
CONTACT FREAKY REAKY AT THE MAIL ROOM."

336
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:08,518
So what's her name?

337
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:12,060
Her name is Marjorie Fontaine.

338
00:21:12,357 --> 00:21:14,980
- Is she hot?
- Sensual!

339
00:21:14,992 --> 00:21:16,600
Wait, wait... which one is she?

340
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,670
Is she the one with the
eyes on either side of her head?

341
00:21:18,688 --> 00:21:21,000
- No, she's not Hammerhead.
- Hammerhead's not hot!

342
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:24,100
- I think hammerhead is kinda cute.
- That's ridiculous. Hammerhead isn't cute.

343
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:27,654
- Fellas!
- Hey! What's up my man?

344
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,838
Hey, Freaky, you know
who Marjorie Fontaine is.

345
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,896
Oh yeah!

346
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:37,116
Marjorie Fontaine is the track trotter.

347
00:21:38,538 --> 00:21:41,066
Oh that's her?
Oh well now it's perfectly clear!

348
00:21:41,072 --> 00:21:43,242
- Do you work out?
- Occasionally.

349
00:21:43,253 --> 00:21:45,970
Well, she is at the track every day.

350
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:50,150
And I mean every single day,
just a-looping the thing!

351
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:54,037
And no matter what time you get there,
she'll already be running!

352
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:59,141
And no matter what time you leave,
she'll still be running!

353
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:03,250
- Hideous purple tights?
- I might say she's not so hideous herself...

354
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,057
- That's the girl?
- Yeah, so what?

355
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,077
Adios muchachos. Keep the peace.
Keep the peace.

356
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,390
See you later Mamont.

357
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,684
I still have no idea who she is.

358
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:16,374
Did you get her number?

359
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:19,041
- Sort of.
- What do you mean "sort of"?

360
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,700
Check this out.

361
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,180
- Wow that's fucked up.
- What? What?

362
00:22:29,498 --> 00:22:31,470
- There's only six digits.
- Exactly!

363
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,932
- What the hell is that supposed to mean?
- Six digits? Oh yeah!

364
00:22:36,794 --> 00:22:40,230
- Maybe it's her zip code
- Zip code has five numbers, asshead,

365
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,262
And why the hell would
she leave him her zip code?

366
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:46,044
I'm just sayin' it's possible,
I mean it's clearly not a phone line.

367
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,070
Maybe it's just the first
six digits of her number,

368
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,190
and she wants you to figure out the seventh.

369
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:53,810
What kinda goddamned maniac does that?

370
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,634
- Marjorie Fontaine.
- Anyway, I already tried that,

371
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,437
I dialed the first six, and then 1,
and then 2, and then 3 all the way to 9.

372
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,904
How embarrassing!

373
00:23:02,234 --> 00:23:05,410
- Hey... you try zero?
- Yeah, I tried zero!

374
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,464
None of them worked, huh?

375
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:09,750
No, but I got the home phone number
of the guy who owns the Rick Johnson Pizzeria.

376
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,632
- Rick Johnson?
- Yeah.

377
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,100
He's an asshole!

378
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,416
Do you think she
did this to you on purpose?

379
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:21,590
I don't know. I mean, you don't just write your
phone number down and forget to write the seventh digit.

380
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,041
Maybe it's one of those love numbers.

381
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:29,178
You know, like 24, 7, 365?

382
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:35,345
Oh like she wants to be with him 24 hours
a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year?

383
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,105
Well, the numbers are: 21, 3, 147.

384
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:44,417
Oh so, I guess she wants to be with you 21 hours
a day, three days a week, a 147 days a year.

385
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,112
Yeah, lick me you little freak!

386
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:53,680
Well actually, 3 days a week would figure out
to be 156 days a year, and not 147 days a year!

387
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,894
Maybe she's dutch... Don't those
European phone numbers have six digits?

388
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,940
So basically, what you're gonna
have to do is go through this thing...

389
00:24:06,954 --> 00:24:10,830
and plug in a new number in every gap
until she finally answers the phone?

390
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:11,734
Yeah.

391
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:14,480
That's grim, brother!

392
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,000
- Hey, how's it going?
- Hey, what's up?

393
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:28,940
- Not much.
- I thought I heard you guys over there.

394
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:32,828
- You wanna take a study break?
- I dunno, I really have to finish this.

395
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,972
- Can I meet you later?
- Sure.

396
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,654
I'm supposed to go to Emily's play tonight.
Do you want to go?

397
00:24:37,973 --> 00:24:40,554
Uh... Is that that all womens' theater group thing?

398
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,114
Yup.

399
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,412
Is that gonna be any good?

400
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,542
It might be kind of... alternative.

401
00:24:45,754 --> 00:24:47,360
What? Like... nudity?

402
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:50,657
I dunno Felix, I guess
you'll have to see for yourself.

403
00:24:50,848 --> 00:24:52,800
Okay. I'll see you later.

404
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:54,860
Okay. See you.

405
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,350
Directory Assistance.

406
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,300
Unlisted.

407
00:25:01,317 --> 00:25:02,410
Damn!

408
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:09,489
I can't imagine how they're
possibly gonna be able to pull this thing off.

409
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,440
I mean, this is a classic piece of work.
They have to be very careful not to ruin it.

410
00:25:15,456 --> 00:25:17,220
Don't you think
that's a bit of a stretch?

411
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:19,313
To call this a classic piece of work?

412
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,358
C'mon, there've been
like six sequels to this thing!

413
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,198
I don't see sequels.

414
00:25:24,474 --> 00:25:27,000
Well now, that's ridiculous.
Some sequels are pretty good.

415
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:28,598
Oh yeah? Like what?

416
00:25:29,808 --> 00:25:31,130
"Jaws 2"...

417
00:25:31,146 --> 00:25:32,202
"Splash 2"...

418
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:34,465
"Empire Strikes Back" was awesome!

419
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,340
"Rocky 2", he wins...

420
00:25:36,645 --> 00:25:38,030
I didn't see any of 'em.

421
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,840
Well, you don't know what you're missing.

422
00:25:39,861 --> 00:25:42,540
Yes I do. Explosions, tits and ass,

423
00:25:42,554 --> 00:25:45,780
explosions, tits and ass,
explosions tits and ass...

424
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:49,100
You're just pissed because
they don't make sequels to chick movies.

425
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,950
I mean, who would go see...

426
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,910
"Mystic Pizza 2"?

427
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,464
"Mystic Pizza" was a good movie!

428
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,545
Yeah, I bet... I never saw it.

429
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:59,990
Well too bad, you
could've seen Julia Roberts naked.

430
00:26:00,912 --> 00:26:02,450
She's not naked in that movie.

431
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:06,934
She sure is! Completely naked!
And she kisses Winona Ryder.

432
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:09,953
She does not!

433
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:11,873
Shh!

434
00:26:14,821 --> 00:26:18,316
HA HA HA HA HAAA!

435
00:26:19,408 --> 00:26:20,670
That's Emily.

436
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:25,050
<i>You'll never get away with this,
Rex Ruthor, you'll never get away with this!</i>

437
00:26:25,066 --> 00:26:29,240
<i>Rois Rane, there're only
ten minutes till detonation.</i>

438
00:26:29,258 --> 00:26:31,440
<i>No one can stop me now!</i>

439
00:26:31,452 --> 00:26:37,159
<i>No one, HAHAHAHA...HAAA.</i>

440
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,152
<i>Look!</i>

441
00:26:42,314 --> 00:26:44,293
<i>Look, it's super-person!</i>

442
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,060
<i>It's over Rex Ruthor!</i>

443
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:56,370
I know there's supposed to be
some sort of message here,

444
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,912
but... I just don't...

445
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,057
Shh! I'll explain it to you later!

446
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,097
Thanks for sitting through that with me, Felix.

447
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:24,065
A lot of guys I know would've gone
to the bathroom and never come back!

448
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,782
Well, there was no
mens' bathroom for this production.

449
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:41,080
I really like being with you, Felix...

450
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:42,401
But?

451
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:44,886
I don't know.

452
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,902
What's is it? Traci?

453
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:49,425
Well honestly, yeah.

454
00:27:50,224 --> 00:27:52,440
- Any time you wanna stop...
- No I don't!

455
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:55,414
Well, it's no big deal. I mean
I'm fine with the way things are.

456
00:27:55,546 --> 00:27:57,280
But Traci and I are still goin' out.

457
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:59,660
I know. I know, I'm just saying...

458
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,278
It's okay with me if
we both date other people.

459
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:04,326
Are you dating anyone else?

460
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:06,396
No, but I'm just saying.

461
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:11,345
Oh, okay. I mean, yeah. Sure. Cool.

462
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,577
He couldn't even smell it...

463
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,588
- Can I get you another cold one?
- Sure!

464
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,524
I'll be right back.

465
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,942
- Mathew.
- Grogan.

466
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,826
- Well hey, Sara!
- Hey Matt!

467
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,201
- Grogan is so funny!
- Yeah.

468
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,985
Hey, sounds to me like you... <i>like</i> him.

469
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,180
Well...

470
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:57,488
Wow, you and "garbage-dick"...

471
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:00,161
- That's great, I mean he was just saying that-
- Wait. What did you say?

472
00:29:00,506 --> 00:29:02,320
I was just sayin' how "garbage-dick"
told me he thought you were kinda...

473
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:04,806
- "Garbage-dick"?
- Yeah.

474
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:11,766
Oh, no no! I mean, it's no big deal,
I mean it was at least a year or two ago anyway.

475
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:13,596
Wait, what does that mean?

476
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:17,094
I wouldn't worry about it.

477
00:29:17,392 --> 00:29:19,146
Besides, everyone wears
condoms these days, right?

478
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:20,892
Hey, Hi Billy, Hi!

479
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:24,892
For you.

480
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,313
What?

481
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:38,310
Hey, what's up? How you doin'?

482
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,470
- Oh hey Zach!
- Hi Zach!

483
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:43,505
You haven't seen Felix around, have you?

484
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,270
He was here...

485
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:47,089
I think he left.

486
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,340
Okay. Thanks.

487
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:51,585
See ya!

488
00:29:54,874 --> 00:29:57,109
- We gotta get outta here.
- Why does he want to meet you here?

489
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,442
I don't know, that's what he said!

490
00:29:58,453 --> 00:29:59,620
This is ridiculous!

491
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:01,404
Alright. Here's what we're gonna do.

492
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:05,329
I'll tell him that you felt sick, and
that you went home and to just go there.

493
00:30:05,594 --> 00:30:08,405
- He's here!
- Who? Thunder or Firefly?

494
00:30:08,416 --> 00:30:09,194
Thunder.

495
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,390
Shit!

496
00:30:10,464 --> 00:30:11,957
Wait... which one is that?

497
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:13,968
Traci - Thunder, Felix - Firefly?

498
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:16,740
Alright, let's get <i>Thunder</i> and get outta here.

499
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,804
and then...

500
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,321
Let's lose the nicknames.

501
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,614
- Hey!
- Hey!

502
00:30:26,901 --> 00:30:28,400
I'm so psyched you're here!

503
00:30:28,416 --> 00:30:31,050
Yeah, I'm glad I got in touch with
you before you went out for the night.

504
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,244
Oh, Yeah. Me too.

505
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,145
I thought you were busy this weekend.

506
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,842
Well I was, but my rugby game got canceled.

507
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:42,982
So I've got tomorrow off.

508
00:30:46,976 --> 00:30:48,040
Let's get outta here.

509
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:49,116
Let me get my bag.

510
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,716
Hey, how you doin'?

511
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:01,002
I'm doing well, thank you!

512
00:31:01,898 --> 00:31:03,445
I had a good time...

513
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:07,110
- I'm ready.
- Trace, you remember Felix, right?

514
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:09,873
You're that guy who hugged me.

515
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,457
Uh... yeah.

516
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,229
- Nice to see you.
- Hey!

517
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:19,190
Right, well... I'm actually takin' off
right now. I just wanted to say hello.

518
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,041
See you later.

519
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,772
Okay. See ya!

520
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,774
Suze... Keep that guy away from me.

521
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,500
I think he's... what do you call it?

522
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:32,742
Gay!

523
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,732
I really have a lot to do today, so...

524
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,308
Uh yeah, I should probably get outta here.

525
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:54,369
Yeah.

526
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,302
Let's have brunch sometime.

527
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:59,292
Oh! That'd be great.

528
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:02,268
Uh... do you have my number?

529
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,436
It's in the book, right?

530
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,190
Yeah, right.

531
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,302
So, I'll just get it from there.

532
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:10,657
Cool.

533
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,705
All I'm sayin' is, it was
a sticky situation last night.

534
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,732
Are you gonna call her?

535
00:32:17,221 --> 00:32:19,722
Jennifer Montgomery?
She said we'd have brunch sometime.

536
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:22,240
- I'm talkin' about Suzanne, fool!
- Ah!

537
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:24,650
Well actually, she called me. She said...

538
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:27,041
she was sorry and
she wants to see me tonight.

539
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,334
I guess that's a good sign.

540
00:32:29,525 --> 00:32:31,077
Well, you know, I couldn't care less!

541
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,732
I totally believe you.

542
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:36,001
Alright, hotshot, enough stalling.
Are we gonna do this?

543
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:38,929
I dunno...

544
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,481
Maybe I should just go home, dial the rest of
the numbers. She's bound to answer eventually, right?

545
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,262
How many calls have you made?

546
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:51,068
- Twenty.
- And how many possible phone numbers are there?

547
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:56,220
- Eighty.
- So you've only done 20 out of 80?

548
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,308
Have you ever dialed twenty
wrong numbers in a row?

549
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:00,161
No.

550
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,596
It's embarrassing!

551
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:06,204
As embarrassing as hiding behind
these bleachers, you quivering pup?

552
00:33:06,709 --> 00:33:08,790
Okay, let's do it!

553
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,718
Alright.

554
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,030
Have you ever seen "Mystic Pizza"?

555
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,540
I thought that was a chick's movie.

556
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:16,618
It is.

557
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,268
But I've heard it's pretty good.

558
00:33:20,437 --> 00:33:21,420
There!

559
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,112
Marjorie Fontaine.

560
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:29,793
That's her?

561
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,105
I have seen <i>her</i> before.

562
00:33:34,629 --> 00:33:35,880
Damn, boy!

563
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:37,222
Get that number!

564
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,846
This is ridiculous!
Maybe we should run or something.

565
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,286
I'm not runnin'!

566
00:33:43,568 --> 00:33:45,400
- C'mon!
- Nah I don't wanna run!

567
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:48,092
She's gonna be comin' around again
and we're gonna be standin' right here!

568
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:52,742
Please!

569
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,260
As a man!

570
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:59,808
Alright, ponch. But only
because I like your smile!

571
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:04,102
- Alright, say something to her.
- No man, shut up!

572
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,737
Hey Marjorie!

573
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,286
- Shut up!
- What?

574
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:14,252
- Goddamn... this is pathetic!
- Let's get outta here.

575
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:18,714
C'mon Zach! All you
have to do is start waving...

576
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,620
when she comes around the bend,
so she's got enough time to see you.

577
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,142
Wave!

578
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,833
See? There you go!

579
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:35,240
Now just ask her for
her number when she gets here.

580
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:38,428
Hey Zach, call me sometime!

581
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:40,300
Goddamn!

582
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,860
This is bullshit!

583
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,730
I'm gettin' her damn number!

584
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:46,040
That's the spirit!

585
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:50,406
You better do it soon though,
she's headed for the womens' locker room.

586
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:54,534
Unless of course, you wanna
stick around and wait for her to come out.

587
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:57,292
So she thinks you're stalking her.

588
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:00,490
Creepy!

589
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:21,564
NO! MARJORIE!

590
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,166
- How many phone numbers?
- Eighty.

591
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:35,836
Hey Zach, call me sometime!

592
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,166
I'm <i>your</i> lawyer.

593
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:54,262
I'm here to get <i>you</i> off.

594
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:02,428
Okay, these are the facts
according to the security report.

595
00:36:03,424 --> 00:36:06,512
The back door was
wide open when security got there.

596
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:10,420
Sensing danger, security officer Reese
entered the building, heard some noises,

597
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:13,066
and followed those noises into the kitchen.

598
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,989
Upon reaching the kitchen area,

599
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:22,620
the officer found two unidentified
perpetrators in front of the refrigerator.

600
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:31,050
- dressed in pink blouses and hats...
- Matt's guilty

601
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:34,156
with this sort of luncheon
meat stuffed in their mouths.

602
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:36,090
Would you two cut it out?

603
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,493
He's messin' with my psyche!

604
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,854
This guy's nuts!

605
00:36:39,082 --> 00:36:42,565
No nuts is thinkin' you can smuggle
an industrial sized tub of pancake mix

606
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:45,110
out of the cafeteria in your pants, Jumbo!

607
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:49,510
I was gonna give that
pancake mix to some local orphan boys.

608
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:53,740
What, were you gonna fatten them up,
so you could eat 'em, you monstrous pig?

609
00:36:54,992 --> 00:36:56,304
He pissed in the parmesan cheese!

610
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:57,890
I demand a separate trial!

611
00:36:57,904 --> 00:36:59,680
Shut up, both of you!

612
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:01,238
Matt, go sit over there!

613
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,406
You guys could be in big trouble!

614
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:21,090
The judiciary board is considering
suspending you for the rest of the semester!

615
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:27,516
This is a serious offense!

616
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:30,250
Eating ice cream?

617
00:37:33,226 --> 00:37:36,520
Now it's possible that I may be
able to get you a reduced sentence.

618
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:41,142
The board looks very favorably on honesty,
so you have to be honest with me.

619
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:43,094
They think there's a third guy.

620
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:44,817
"A third guy"

621
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:46,944
They found the back window open.

622
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,020
I dunno what you're talkin' about.

623
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:52,561
I don't think that you two are
smart enough to pull this off alone.

624
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:53,708
So talk!

625
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,484
You see, right now,
you're lookin' at murder one

626
00:37:57,570 --> 00:38:00,860
So I strongly suggest
you start singin', my fine friend!

627
00:38:01,229 --> 00:38:03,260
I didn't do nuthin'!

628
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:04,640
Alright, have it your way!

629
00:38:05,632 --> 00:38:08,149
Give my regards to
Leon the birdman up in the state pen...

630
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:10,257
I hear he likes his turkeys plump!

631
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:12,934
Alright... Alright, I'll talk!

632
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,942
I stashed the body up in
Beggar's Canyon, in the old mine shaft.

633
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:22,416
But I want witness protection!

634
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:25,649
Hey! We'll set you up in an
entirely different part of the campus!

635
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:29,640
No, no, no. No name, no grades, no book bag!

636
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:32,870
- Don't push me!
- No book bag, no deal!

637
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:36,262
You hear that counselor? No book bag, no deal!

638
00:38:37,338 --> 00:38:38,758
Cruncha, cruncha, cruncha...

639
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,292
went the boot in the snow...

640
00:38:42,954 --> 00:38:44,961
Gotta huncha, huncha, huncha...

641
00:38:46,042 --> 00:38:47,718
there's more than we know...

642
00:38:49,296 --> 00:38:51,718
Pandas bearing down on us...

643
00:38:52,272 --> 00:38:53,937
Nowhere for us to go...

644
00:38:56,085 --> 00:38:57,302
WATCH IT!

645
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:11,650
Really Felix, I wanna explain.

646
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:14,737
What's to explain?
I know you go out with another guy.

647
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,970
I guess it's just the way
it's gonna be, right? Right.

648
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,890
I didn't know he was coming.
He was gonna surprise me.

649
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,545
Yippee!

650
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:24,480
I said I was sorry.

651
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:27,462
Okay. So let's just put it behind us, alright?

652
00:39:29,136 --> 00:39:32,102
Besides, if I hug him again
I'm gonna have to ask him to the prom.

653
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,110
You ready for the big trial?

654
00:39:35,434 --> 00:39:38,750
Yeah, I guess so. Your pals
aren't being very smart though.

655
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,380
The board has latched on to this
third guy thing and they're not giving up.

656
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:43,606
They want a name.

657
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:45,696
Maybe there is no third guy.

658
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:49,121
Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Emily Cooper.

659
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:05,996
<i>Whoo!</i>

660
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,224
C'mon give her a chance. She's not that bad.
<i>How many of y'all like to party 'cause...</i>

661
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:16,530
<i>I am gonna rock you tonight, alright!
Cooper university... Whoo!</i>

662
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:32,081
Do you have any protection,
Mr. I-wanna-have-sex?

663
00:40:32,672 --> 00:40:35,220
- Uh... no.
- I do.

664
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:36,108
You do?

665
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,961
The inside kind? Or the outside kind?

666
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,865
The outside kind.

667
00:40:41,349 --> 00:40:44,230
The outside kind for me?
Or the outside kind for you?

668
00:40:44,245 --> 00:40:46,000
I've got condoms, Felix!

669
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:48,773
Oh, well that's what
I thought, I just wasn't sure.

670
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,278
They're in the drawer.

671
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,540
What would be
the outside kind for me?

672
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,590
A diaphragm.

673
00:41:06,058 --> 00:41:09,170
I mean I know it's not really
outside you but, it comes from the outside.

674
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,592
So, it's not like the pill,

675
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:14,252
which would be the serious inside kind,
because that's just <i>way</i> inside you.

676
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,246
Shut up, Felix!

677
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,826
This is weird.

678
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,540
What's wrong?

679
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:27,970
I don't wanna do it anymore.

680
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:29,825
Why not?

681
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,908
It's just... not as spontaneous.

682
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:38,230
Okay, how 'bout if I leave the room...

683
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,370
and then I come back in, and...

684
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,257
we could start from there.

685
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:43,729
Felix!

686
00:42:04,778 --> 00:42:06,300
Huh? Huh?

687
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:07,040
Pre-wrapped?

688
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:09,238
It's a little more spontaneous, right?

689
00:42:10,554 --> 00:42:12,348
Oh no! Oh no!

690
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,521
Is Marjorie there?

691
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,681
I'm sorry, I must have the wrong number.

692
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,118
Hello, is Marjorie there?

693
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:37,622
I'm sorry, I must have the wrong number.

694
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:39,484
Harder.

695
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:41,212
Harder!

696
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:42,865
Harder!

697
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:47,570
- Not so hard!
- Hello! Hello, is Marjorie there?

698
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:51,670
I'm sorry, I must have the wrong number.

699
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,857
You guys gonna have a theme party?

700
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:56,210
Yeah. 60's baby!

701
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:58,360
Hey, you tell Suzanne to bring Emily.

702
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:02,060
I'd like to see how she
dresses for the "summer of love".

703
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,836
I will, if I see her.

704
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:05,125
What do you mean, "if I see her"?

705
00:43:05,136 --> 00:43:06,860
I thought you guys patched things up.

706
00:43:07,072 --> 00:43:08,610
Well yeah, we definitely did.

707
00:43:08,629 --> 00:43:09,381
But...

708
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:12,570
I'm a little unsure as to whether or not
things are completely... "<i>settled</i>".

709
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:14,906
Why? 'cause of "<i>Thunder</i>"?

710
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,246
What? What's "Thunder"?

711
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:24,257
Thunder is what Emily and
Suzanne call her other boyfriend.

712
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:25,840
How do you know that?

713
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:27,878
Freaky's a mailman. Freaky knows all.

714
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:30,982
Well, why do they call him Thunder?

715
00:43:31,237 --> 00:43:34,220
What do you think?
It's a pretty badass name!

716
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:35,760
Hello, is Marjorie there?

717
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:39,169
I'm sorry, I must have the wrong number.

718
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:40,940
Thunder...

719
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:45,472
You know they got a particular
nickname for the Lima Bean man too?

720
00:43:45,754 --> 00:43:47,500
- Oh yeah?
- <i>Is Marjorie there?</i>

721
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:53,340
<i>No? Okay, I have the wrong number.</i>

722
00:43:58,030 --> 00:43:59,310
Well, what is it?

723
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,812
"Firefly"

724
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:03,870
<i>Firefly</i>?

725
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:04,993
Yeah.

726
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,940
As in "Lightning Bug"!

727
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:10,289
Hello, is Marjorie there?

728
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:12,273
She is?

729
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:17,254
Hey Marjorie, this is Zach!

730
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:18,758
Hey, is that her?

731
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:21,845
Zach Streader...

732
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:28,620
I'm sorry, I must have the wrong Marjorie.

733
00:44:30,852 --> 00:44:31,870
Fuck you!

734
00:44:31,888 --> 00:44:33,310
Yo ask her if she'll go out with Matt!

735
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,244
Fuck you! Fuck you!

736
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:37,410
No, no, no. I'm not talking to you!

737
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:38,840
Fuck you, Firefly!

738
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,745
- Yo hang up, I'll go out with her.
- Fuck you!

739
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:43,377
Man fuck you!

740
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:24,262
Cool!

741
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,569
Thought they said fifties.

742
00:45:58,370 --> 00:45:59,600
Hey Grogan!

743
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:00,956
Hey!

744
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:02,580
Is Matt okay?

745
00:46:04,245 --> 00:46:05,510
Looks pretty good to me.

746
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,942
Well... does he have a girlfriend?

747
00:46:09,525 --> 00:46:11,430
No no no...

748
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:14,050
No girlfriend...

749
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,338
He's too loyal.

750
00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:17,222
What do you mean?

751
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:20,198
Well, I think he's still married.

752
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:25,136
I told Traci I was seein' someone else.

753
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:27,098
Mmhmm... what did he say?

754
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:29,436
He said he wanted to beat the guy up.

755
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:31,450
He's such a baby!

756
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:32,906
Did you tell him it was me?

757
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,905
No! I wouldn't tell him who it was!

758
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,240
I told him he was stupid!

759
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:40,864
Actually, I don't know if he's <i>legally</i> married.

760
00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:44,316
See, he spent his last summer
in Natchez, Mississippi

761
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,545
Had a thing with a 12-year-old.

762
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:49,270
I shouldn't be talking about this.

763
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:50,784
Twelve?

764
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:53,706
Would you say he's bigger than I am?

765
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:56,870
Yeah, he's bigger than you. So?

766
00:46:57,034 --> 00:46:58,290
What do you mean "so"?

767
00:46:58,300 --> 00:46:59,638
What if we get into a fight?

768
00:46:59,818 --> 00:47:01,430
You're not gonna get into a fight!

769
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:02,492
How do you know?

770
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:04,945
Because I think you're more mature than that.

771
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,854
What, you don't think I can fight?

772
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:10,444
I didn't say that Felix, I just
don't think of you as the fighting type.

773
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:12,518
What's up Soapy?

774
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:18,049
See, they got married and the
cops found out, and well, you know cops.

775
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:21,788
That kinda ended it. They still write, though.

776
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:26,038
Well, he writes, she's still lurnin'.

777
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:30,785
Men do not like to be told
that another man can beat them up.

778
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:33,558
It's like your daughter's bike.

779
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:36,880
You would never let you neighbor
put your daughter's bike together.

780
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:39,132
Ah it's no big deal you know, it's over.

781
00:47:39,322 --> 00:47:43,674
He's not allowed into Mississippi anymore,
and she wanted to raise the kid there and...

782
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,306
Between you and me,
I think that's for the best.

783
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:50,476
- Hey, Spudhead!
- Hey Grogan!

784
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,777
Hey Julie.

785
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:57,798
Maybe I can take you.

786
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:14,956
Ow!

787
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,105
God!

788
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:21,393
Talk dirty to me, Felix.

789
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,102
What?

790
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:26,320
I don't know what to say.

791
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:29,206
C'mon, don't be so conservative!

792
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,838
- Oh God.
- Come on!

793
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:34,108
Okay.

794
00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:38,520
Not like that!

795
00:48:38,885 --> 00:48:39,890
That's gross!

796
00:48:39,909 --> 00:48:41,330
What? That's dirty!

797
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:45,206
That's disgusting!
Until I have to go to the bathroom?

798
00:48:45,350 --> 00:48:47,660
Well, that's not <i>really</i> what it means.

799
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:50,860
Look, you said "talk dirty" to you,
that's what I did.

800
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:53,880
That is something you do to a prostitute.

801
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:57,240
That's something you
do to Jennifer Montgomery.

802
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,174
You didn't think I knew, did you?

803
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:05,260
You stupid, revenge, asshole!

804
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:08,229
Jennifer Montgomery is not a prostitute.

805
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:10,785
I didn't say she was, but don't defend her!

806
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,760
Do you know how embarrassing that is?
That I have to see her around campus?

807
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:21,862
Did you sleep with her
that night Traci was in town?

808
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:26,529
Look, I really do not wanna get into this.

809
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:29,297
It's no big deal, I can take it.

810
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:30,390
Did you?

811
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:36,348
Yes, we had sex!

812
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:40,458
So you have sex with that prostitute,

813
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:43,270
and you wanna fuck me
till I have to go number two?

814
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:44,938
Well if that's all women are to you Felix,

815
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,292
then why don't you just
line 'em up and fuck 'em all?

816
00:49:47,392 --> 00:49:48,885
What happened to "talking dirty" to you?

817
00:49:48,890 --> 00:49:50,428
You're sexist!

818
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:53,510
Sexist? I'm a sexist?

819
00:49:54,842 --> 00:49:56,410
I think you're confused...

820
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:59,936
Are you saying I'm a sexist
because I enjoy having sex?

821
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:03,194
Well I guess you'll have to ask
Jennifer Montgomery about that.

822
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:07,388
Oh, come on Suzanne, you were
having sex with your boyfriend at the time!

823
00:50:07,501 --> 00:50:10,910
Well, at least I didn't just meet him
in a bar and go home with him in one night!

824
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,370
We've been sleeping together four years.

825
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,889
Oh well, that makes me feel so much better!

826
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:19,540
Look, Felix,

827
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:21,760
I'm not into playing games, alright?

828
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:24,757
Suzanne, you are still
going out with another guy!

829
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,370
But that's what we agreed to!

830
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:27,980
Well then, that's what I'm doing!

831
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:35,356
<i>Hey Suze it's me Traci...
"Me llamo Traci..."</i>

832
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:40,918
Well, you might as well
get that because I'm outta here.

833
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:01,516
Freaky!

834
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:05,080
Freaky!

835
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:05,116
Box 4-1-1-3.
Freaky!

836
00:51:05,116 --> 00:51:07,590
Box 4-1-1-3.

837
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:08,492
What?

838
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:12,401
Box 4-1-1-3.

839
00:51:19,930 --> 00:51:22,902
What's up, me Mexican jumping Bean?

840
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:25,446
Smooth party tonight, huh?

841
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,329
Yep.

842
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:31,057
So what brings you to my little
holes in the wall at this hour, 'Lix?

843
00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:34,220
I dunno. I'm...
actually having some problems.

844
00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:36,129
Lady troubles, eh?

845
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:41,516
Tell you what... I got just the thing.

846
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:44,832
Box 4-1-8-7.

847
00:51:45,408 --> 00:51:46,220
What?

848
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:50,364
Right Four, left three, right one. Hutt!

849
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:55,596
Speedy delivery.

850
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,572
So, green Bean...

851
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:02,597
Traci with an "I"?

852
00:52:04,266 --> 00:52:07,720
I dunno, I'm actually
starting to get into this...

853
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:09,910
relationship, if you wanna call it that.

854
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:14,321
And this guy just keeps
getting in the way. I can't...

855
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:16,385
seem to find a way around him.

856
00:52:16,682 --> 00:52:18,080
The fact is, Bean pod...

857
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:21,494
If you want her, you gotta close the door...

858
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,837
You gotta make her want you more.

859
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:26,337
Want me more?

860
00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:27,254
Yeah.

861
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,676
You're wittier than this cat, right?

862
00:52:30,442 --> 00:52:31,180
Sure.

863
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:34,330
Coooooler than this cat, right?

864
00:52:35,061 --> 00:52:35,568
Yeah.

865
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:38,369
Zippier than this cat, right?

866
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:39,936
Uh... I guess so.

867
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:42,268
Well then prove it to her, baby!

868
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:45,121
You gotta outshine this dude.

869
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:47,137
You have to eclipse him.

870
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:51,190
You gotta be the Jupiter to his Mars.

871
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:53,852
The gold to his bronze.

872
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:56,705
The wheat to his chaff.

873
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:00,214
Get some hotels on your property.

874
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:02,278
<i>Freaky...</i>

875
00:53:06,330 --> 00:53:10,001
Gots to go, Beano!

876
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:11,889
Keep the fig, man!

877
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:13,460
Catch you later.

878
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:22,369
Oh, Freaky!

879
00:53:35,632 --> 00:53:36,800
Sorry about that, Felix.

880
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:38,930
Oh! I thought this was practice!

881
00:53:38,970 --> 00:53:41,930
Yeah well I couldn't let the beginner
get away without a bit of punishment, right?

882
00:53:41,946 --> 00:53:42,760
Oh yeah?

883
00:53:42,770 --> 00:53:44,209
I'll get you for that, Greg.

884
00:53:45,306 --> 00:53:46,330
Vengeance, eh?

885
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:49,690
That's right. I'm gonna teach
your grandmother how to swim, bitch!

886
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:51,260
That's good, you're getting it!

887
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,300
Thanks!

888
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:55,669
I guess I need a little coaching
in the trash talking department though, huh?

889
00:53:55,950 --> 00:54:00,080
Well Felix, you see... the art of trash talking's
used to intimidate the opponent, right?

890
00:54:01,290 --> 00:54:03,490
Will you guys please think about your future?

891
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:06,225
Now you have 15 minutes
before you're in front of the judge.

892
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:11,461
I really might be able to
get you guys off with just probation.

893
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:14,833
Besides that streaking thing,
this is basically your first offense.

894
00:54:15,470 --> 00:54:17,313
But you have to tell me the truth.

895
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:19,932
Who was the third guy?

896
00:54:25,392 --> 00:54:28,260
You guys, you don't even
have to tell the judge!

897
00:54:28,272 --> 00:54:31,585
I'll take full responsibility
for seeing that you guys get a break!

898
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:34,268
I'll give him the name!

899
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:38,572
Well...

900
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,457
We can't <i>tell</i> you...

901
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:43,542
But...

902
00:54:57,430 --> 00:54:59,866
Hey! Everyone ready for the big trial?

903
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,878
I'll see you in the courtroom.

904
00:55:22,378 --> 00:55:23,880
Hi, how you doin'?

905
00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:25,290
Fine. How are you?

906
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,170
I'm fine, how are you?

907
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,345
What are you doing here, Felix?

908
00:55:30,704 --> 00:55:33,360
I dunno, it's just that...
last night was kinda messed up.

909
00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:36,822
Felix! I really can't
talk about that right now!

910
00:55:37,498 --> 00:55:39,760
This trial... Matt and Grogan are-

911
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:41,292
What are you wearing?

912
00:55:44,030 --> 00:55:45,201
Okay, look...

913
00:55:47,146 --> 00:55:48,600
I've gotta tell you something.

914
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:55,660
I'm goin' home for the weekend.

915
00:55:57,470 --> 00:55:59,560
You need to tell me
you're going home for the weekend?

916
00:55:59,813 --> 00:56:01,810
Yeah. But it's no big deal.

917
00:56:02,011 --> 00:56:03,270
Well, why would it be a big deal?

918
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:07,382
Well, it's not. That's what I'm saying.
I just need some time to think. I don't...

919
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:11,100
I've gotta go. The trial's about to start.

920
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:13,926
Okay, then I'll
call you over the weekend.

921
00:56:14,229 --> 00:56:15,380
No, don't call me.

922
00:56:15,397 --> 00:56:16,362
Why can't I call you?

923
00:56:16,370 --> 00:56:18,470
Just don't Felix, I'll see you Sunday.

924
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:39,248
Hey, you scab!

925
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:41,168
What?

926
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,449
What do they pay you to
sell out your fellow students, huh?

927
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,537
It's actually for credit.

928
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:49,258
Pre-law class?

929
00:56:50,590 --> 00:56:52,230
Pre-law class.

930
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:53,590
Hey!

931
00:56:54,030 --> 00:56:55,930
You ever heard of Suzanne McKenna?

932
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:58,309
Of course! She's in my class.

933
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:01,590
Yeah? Well, she's gonna kick your ass!

934
00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:06,618
You guys were caught red-handed!

935
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:07,580
Oh yeah?

936
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,801
Well, she's gonna kick your ass!

937
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:12,508
Okay.

938
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:17,398
How you guys doin'?

939
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:19,004
I don't know.

940
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:20,886
Why don't you ask our lawyer?

941
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,230
Maybe you guys should cool it a bit, huh?

942
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:24,990
Why?

943
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,678
Suzanne's an awesome lawyer!

944
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:31,010
Maybe you've heard of
"Brown vs. Board of Education," 1954?

945
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:33,450
"Ali vs. Frazier," 1972?

946
00:57:33,466 --> 00:57:35,670
"Earth vs. The Spider," 1958.

947
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:39,574
"Kramer vs. Kramer," 1979.

948
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:40,950
Shut up!

949
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:43,020
It's a movie.

950
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:46,850
Anyway, we came up
with a foolproof plan...

951
00:57:46,864 --> 00:57:50,360
that'll definitely inspire
Suzanne to bust us out of this joint.

952
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:51,798
What was that?

953
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:55,185
We- we just told her Felix was in on it!

954
00:57:56,010 --> 00:57:59,360
See, now that she knows
that Felix was the third man...

955
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:01,537
She'll definitely get us off.

956
00:58:02,853 --> 00:58:04,245
Maybe that wasn't a good move.

957
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:05,222
Are you kidding?

958
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:07,932
See, she gets us off,
and nothing will happen to Felix.

959
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,782
She's not gonna let us lose!

960
00:58:10,581 --> 00:58:12,342
You guy were caught red-handed.

961
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,185
Why does everyone keep saying that?

962
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:16,890
Good luck!

963
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:18,770
Oyez, oyez.

964
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:21,220
The Judicial Board is now in session.

965
00:58:21,450 --> 00:58:23,450
Dean Hedgepeth presiding.

966
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:25,070
All rise.

967
00:58:36,270 --> 00:58:37,473
Be seated.

968
00:58:43,850 --> 00:58:46,370
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
let's get started.

969
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:48,506
This morning's case is

970
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:52,465
The Students vs. Matthew Fister
and Bartholomew Grogan

971
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:54,860
Is the prosecution ready?

972
00:58:55,890 --> 00:58:57,078
Yes, your honor.

973
00:58:57,670 --> 00:58:59,084
Is the defense ready?

974
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:00,977
You know it!

975
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:04,076
I was asking your counsel Mr. Fister!

976
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:05,550
She's ready too.

977
00:59:08,258 --> 00:59:09,350
Actually, your honor...

978
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:10,790
The defense is not ready.

979
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:18,050
Sir, a conflict of interest has arisen
between the defendants and myself.

980
00:59:18,570 --> 00:59:21,750
Therefore I cannot competently
and of clear mind defend them.

981
00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:25,450
I ask to be taken off the case.

982
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:28,630
You're recusing yourself
on the day of the trial?

983
00:59:29,910 --> 00:59:31,970
Yes, your honor. I'm sorry.

984
00:59:35,550 --> 00:59:36,988
You shouldn't have told me that.

985
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:43,852
Miss McKenna! Miss McKenna!

986
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:49,030
Alright, alright. Settle down, settle down.

987
00:59:49,090 --> 00:59:51,100
This is an unusual set of circumstances.

988
00:59:51,114 --> 00:59:52,997
Your honor I demand a mistrial...

989
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,110
and further move to annul the contender that
the charges against the defendants be dropped.

990
00:59:57,820 --> 01:00:00,522
I second that motion, your honor, visu visu...

991
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:03,269
and ask that all prior statements
be stricken from the record.

992
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:04,416
Corpus Christi.

993
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:06,678
Okay, okay. That's enough.

994
01:00:07,330 --> 01:00:10,385
Gentlemen, we have several
cases to get through this morning.

995
01:00:10,870 --> 01:00:14,890
So in light of these unique circumstances
I'd like to make the following proposal.

996
01:00:15,610 --> 01:00:18,510
Since your lawyer has
excused herself from this trial...

997
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:21,226
You have the option
of representing yourselves,

998
01:00:21,230 --> 01:00:24,481
or being represented
by the court-appointed alternate.

999
01:00:35,530 --> 01:00:38,050
Your honor, may I have
a moment to confer with Mr. Grogan?

1000
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:39,370
By all means.

1001
01:00:49,050 --> 01:00:50,870
Shut up! No...

1002
01:00:54,590 --> 01:00:55,510
Gentlemen?

1003
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:57,766
Your Honor...

1004
01:00:58,309 --> 01:01:00,090
We're prepared to defend ourselves.

1005
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:01,052
Splendid.

1006
01:01:02,510 --> 01:01:05,233
Upon entering the kitchen,
I turned the lights on.

1007
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:08,106
And I noticed the defendants
standing in front of the refrigerator,

1008
01:01:08,110 --> 01:01:09,856
with their mouths full of food.

1009
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:11,809
Thank you, officer.

1010
01:01:12,450 --> 01:01:18,204
Your honor, no further questions.
The defense may now cross-examine the witness.

1011
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:24,700
Not to worry, kid.

1012
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:26,636
I know how to handle this guy.

1013
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:33,712
Officer Reese...

1014
01:01:35,810 --> 01:01:38,464
Isn't it true that you were
on duty on the night in question?

1015
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:39,877
That is correct.

1016
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:46,160
And isn't it also true that the
back door of the cafeteria was left <i>unlocked</i>?

1017
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:47,605
That's correct.

1018
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:50,673
Officer, did you or did you not order the code red?

1019
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:51,370
What?

1020
01:01:51,381 --> 01:01:54,070
Did you or did you not order the code red?

1021
01:01:54,090 --> 01:01:54,900
Mr. Fister!

1022
01:01:54,917 --> 01:01:56,500
Your honor, I want the truth!

1023
01:01:56,510 --> 01:01:58,069
You can't handle the truth!

1024
01:01:58,070 --> 01:02:00,748
- That's enough!
- Mr. Prosecutor, you are out of order!

1025
01:02:01,605 --> 01:02:02,520
Mr. Grogan

1026
01:02:02,530 --> 01:02:04,188
<i>You</i> are out of order.

1027
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:06,081
Please your honor...

1028
01:02:06,430 --> 01:02:08,897
I ask for the court's indulgence.

1029
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:16,641
A wise man once warned that...

1030
01:02:16,901 --> 01:02:20,320
He who represents himself
has a client for lawyer...

1031
01:02:20,330 --> 01:02:21,670
and a lawyer for a client.

1032
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:25,014
Now, what we need to determine here is...

1033
01:02:25,170 --> 01:02:26,534
What is the truth?

1034
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:29,318
And what is the lie?

1035
01:02:30,197 --> 01:02:32,140
- Hey! Hey!
Why, that man's not paralyzed!

1036
01:02:32,150 --> 01:02:34,160
And if that man is not paralyzed,

1037
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:37,600
How do we know that he's a
security officer employed by this university?

1038
01:02:37,610 --> 01:02:38,128
Yes!

1039
01:02:38,450 --> 01:02:40,369
- D-do something!
- Hold it right there!

1040
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:48,310
This court finds you guilty as charged.

1041
01:02:48,421 --> 01:02:50,110
As punishment for your crime...

1042
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:54,430
You will each serve
500 hours of community service.

1043
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:57,686
Your honor...

1044
01:02:57,890 --> 01:03:02,810
Does that mean we have to
do like an hour a day for 500 days?

1045
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:05,004
You can break it up any way you wish.

1046
01:03:06,149 --> 01:03:08,192
Oh, could we do then, like...

1047
01:03:08,202 --> 01:03:09,640
500 hours in one day?

1048
01:03:09,650 --> 01:03:11,020
Next case!

1049
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:16,876
So the thing she needed to tell you
was that she was going home for the weekend?

1050
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:18,801
That's what she said.

1051
01:03:20,590 --> 01:03:22,828
And this was <i>after</i> you guys got in the fight?

1052
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:29,137
Well, Firefly...

1053
01:03:29,930 --> 01:03:31,665
I think I hear some Thunder.

1054
01:03:33,110 --> 01:03:35,670
I thought he was gay!

1055
01:03:35,890 --> 01:03:37,601
Believe me, he's not!

1056
01:03:39,170 --> 01:03:41,013
Well, what does that mean?
Did you fuck him?

1057
01:03:41,024 --> 01:03:42,200
No!

1058
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,162
Are you sure?

1059
01:03:43,173 --> 01:03:44,256
Traci!

1060
01:03:44,350 --> 01:03:47,010
Hey, I thought you
were seeing Suzanne McKenna!

1061
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:48,129
I am.

1062
01:03:48,430 --> 01:03:50,590
So where is she tonight?

1063
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:53,137
- Hey!
- Hey!

1064
01:03:54,170 --> 01:03:56,848
- Hey!
- Hey...

1065
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:04,166
Ah, I'm gonna go get a beer.

1066
01:04:07,162 --> 01:04:07,950
Well...

1067
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:11,462
We were right. She's definitely with Traci.

1068
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:12,598
How do you know?

1069
01:04:12,832 --> 01:04:13,930
I asked Emily.

1070
01:04:13,990 --> 01:04:14,880
She told you?

1071
01:04:14,906 --> 01:04:15,540
No.

1072
01:04:16,170 --> 01:04:17,569
But she hesitated.

1073
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:19,804
She hesitated? Are you sure?

1074
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:21,830
I'm sure as shaving cream!

1075
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:23,510
She blinked, Felix!

1076
01:04:23,530 --> 01:04:25,916
It's a liar's blink. I watched her, man!

1077
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:28,560
She just stood there... blinking.

1078
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,840
She's alone! I swear!

1079
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,852
This is a train wreck, buddy.

1080
01:04:35,925 --> 01:04:36,540
Fuck!

1081
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:37,830
Get off!

1082
01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:40,730
I just don't like you seeing other people!

1083
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:42,026
Well, neither do I!

1084
01:04:42,130 --> 01:04:43,936
Well, maybe we should stop, then.

1085
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:46,522
Stop seein' other people?

1086
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:47,322
Yeah.

1087
01:04:49,210 --> 01:04:50,282
Okay.

1088
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:54,300
Well only if that's gonna
be okay with Felix, of course.

1089
01:04:55,845 --> 01:04:56,730
Suzanne?

1090
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:58,524
No, it's fine.

1091
01:04:59,230 --> 01:05:00,817
I love you, Suzanne.

1092
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:03,910
Traci...

1093
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:06,529
I don't know.

1094
01:05:07,230 --> 01:05:10,400
Ooh! I bet she's
got a lot of spies out tonight!

1095
01:05:10,810 --> 01:05:12,110
Aren't you worried?

1096
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:14,790
Worried about what? We're just talking.

1097
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:18,170
Well, look what happened
the last time we were just talking.

1098
01:05:37,110 --> 01:05:38,769
Let's have brunch sometime.

1099
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:41,217
Oh, that'd... be great.

1100
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:44,012
Do you have my number?

1101
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:46,822
Well, it's in the book, right?

1102
01:05:47,370 --> 01:05:48,620
Yeah, right.

1103
01:06:10,430 --> 01:06:11,382
Ladies.

1104
01:06:12,370 --> 01:06:14,320
Are you kidding? This is popcorn.

1105
01:06:14,330 --> 01:06:16,496
Community service! I'm so scared!

1106
01:06:22,410 --> 01:06:23,621
Community service.

1107
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:10,129
Here we go again.

1108
01:07:10,430 --> 01:07:11,500
<i>Goodbye.</i>

1109
01:07:16,610 --> 01:07:18,200
<i>Jesus.</i>

1110
01:07:22,270 --> 01:07:24,012
You guys doing that for credit?

1111
01:07:25,020 --> 01:07:27,718
Actually, Matt and Grogan
are doin' it for community service.

1112
01:07:31,450 --> 01:07:33,030
So, how was your weekend?

1113
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:34,001
It was good!

1114
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:35,244
How was yours?

1115
01:07:35,310 --> 01:07:36,156
Fine.

1116
01:07:37,093 --> 01:07:38,750
Really? What'd you do?

1117
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:41,030
Where did you say
you were again this weekend?

1118
01:07:41,850 --> 01:07:43,050
I told you, I went home.

1119
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:45,500
Oh, that's right, that's right.

1120
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:48,550
Why? Did you talk to Emily?

1121
01:07:56,410 --> 01:07:58,481
Did I talk to Emily about what, Suzanne?

1122
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:03,457
I was gonna tell you before I left.

1123
01:08:04,450 --> 01:08:05,430
Tell me what?

1124
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:07,494
You're a jerk, Felix!

1125
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:09,169
Am I missing something?

1126
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:12,620
Traci was with me this
weekend at my parents' house.

1127
01:08:12,778 --> 01:08:13,330
I know.

1128
01:08:13,344 --> 01:08:14,630
I know you know!

1129
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:15,696
I know you know I know!

1130
01:08:15,706 --> 01:08:16,725
Were you gonna tell me?

1131
01:08:16,730 --> 01:08:17,590
Yeah!

1132
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,540
- I don't know, I just...'N- Why so sneaky?

1133
01:08:20,992 --> 01:08:23,056
I mean, we are seeing other people after all.

1134
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:25,410
I know! I'm sorry!

1135
01:08:25,740 --> 01:08:28,588
I was just pissed off about
that Jennifer Montgomery thing.

1136
01:08:35,070 --> 01:08:36,876
What Jennifer Montgomery thing?

1137
01:08:37,786 --> 01:08:39,274
"What Jennifer Montgomery thing"

1138
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:41,920
Perhaps you don't remember a couple of weeks ago when you banged her?

1139
01:08:41,930 --> 01:08:44,474
Look, this is about
Traci, not Jennifer Montgomery.

1140
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:47,460
He told me to break up with you.

1141
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:49,473
Is that what you're doing?

1142
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:51,382
No.

1143
01:08:52,580 --> 01:08:53,825
I broke up with him.

1144
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:58,566
Huh.

1145
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:01,248
Not just because of you.
It was just time, I think.

1146
01:09:01,685 --> 01:09:02,970
Well that really changes everything.

1147
01:09:02,992 --> 01:09:04,656
No, I don't want it to change everything.

1148
01:09:04,773 --> 01:09:05,573
Well, it does.

1149
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:06,716
But it shouldn't!

1150
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:09,990
So then... you wanna
continue to see other people?

1151
01:09:10,010 --> 01:09:12,890
No, of course not Felix,
I just broke up with Traci!

1152
01:09:13,370 --> 01:09:14,293
Why? Do you?

1153
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:15,702
No, I don't!

1154
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:22,100
Okay. Then you and I will
stop seeing other people officially,

1155
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:23,500
Starting right now!

1156
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:27,852
What did you do this weekend?

1157
01:09:35,381 --> 01:09:36,890
Did you guys hear Zach got the number?

1158
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:38,460
Oh! you got it?

1159
01:09:38,590 --> 01:09:40,684
It was a seven in the 6th spot.

1160
01:09:41,072 --> 01:09:42,020
Damn!

1161
01:09:42,190 --> 01:09:44,360
I was gonna guess that! Shit!

1162
01:09:44,410 --> 01:09:46,182
Gimme the grubby details.

1163
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:47,820
So, I call her...

1164
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,714
and she says, "Let's go to dinner."

1165
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:51,676
Where'd you go?

1166
01:09:51,829 --> 01:09:52,600
Leather Fish.

1167
01:09:52,610 --> 01:09:54,246
Ooh! Mr. Ritzy pants!

1168
01:09:54,870 --> 01:09:56,726
The conversation was good, right?

1169
01:09:57,237 --> 01:09:58,820
We're drinking, we're laughing...

1170
01:09:58,832 --> 01:10:00,290
You get any action?

1171
01:10:00,656 --> 01:10:02,197
Well wait, right?

1172
01:10:02,220 --> 01:10:04,492
After dinner, we go for a drink at The Jug.

1173
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:07,478
After an hour there, we're both
feelin' pretty good.

1174
01:10:08,090 --> 01:10:10,610
Things are lookin' very promising, alright?

1175
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:12,614
I mean she's getting really close to me...

1176
01:10:12,930 --> 01:10:14,993
I mean, <i>really</i> close!

1177
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:17,440
She's like <i>this</i> close.

1178
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:19,398
I get the point.

1179
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:21,772
I could've leaned out to kiss her at any time.

1180
01:10:22,060 --> 01:10:23,622
But you didn't kiss her?

1181
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:26,020
I didn't wanna kiss her in a public place.

1182
01:10:26,070 --> 01:10:27,756
What? Like, on the face?

1183
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:30,960
- Alright. So you walk her home?
- So I walk her home.

1184
01:10:31,180 --> 01:10:32,540
Did you hold hand?

1185
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,710
I don't hold hand.

1186
01:10:35,010 --> 01:10:36,673
- Me neither.
- Me neither.

1187
01:10:36,981 --> 01:10:38,997
So anyway, we're standin'
outside her doorway, right?

1188
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,290
We're both sayin' how good a time we had.

1189
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:43,105
And so I lean in to kiss her.

1190
01:10:43,650 --> 01:10:44,518
And?

1191
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:47,569
And she does the ostrich-neck-pullback thing.

1192
01:10:50,858 --> 01:10:53,409
Oh! No, no, no!

1193
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:55,302
Did you make contact?

1194
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:59,724
I was goin' in, I kept goin' in and I kissed her.

1195
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:02,476
But she gave me the limp lip.

1196
01:11:03,150 --> 01:11:04,442
Maybe she was just nervous!

1197
01:11:04,810 --> 01:11:05,776
About what?

1198
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:07,681
Well, maybe she liked you so much...

1199
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:10,180
and she was so nervous
about being with you that she...

1200
01:11:10,190 --> 01:11:12,800
literally went into a deep lip freeze.

1201
01:11:13,030 --> 01:11:14,422
It happens to me all the time.

1202
01:11:15,460 --> 01:11:21,132
So anyway, as she's going into her house,
she looks at me and she actually says...

1203
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,396
"Hey Zach...

1204
01:11:22,660 --> 01:11:23,920
...call me sometime."

1205
01:11:27,380 --> 01:11:30,550
The campus cops are
really great though, aren't they?

1206
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,330
Great at eating donuts!

1207
01:11:36,165 --> 01:11:38,805
That is so true, baby, that is so true!

1208
01:11:38,816 --> 01:11:40,320
But I don't know...

1209
01:11:40,330 --> 01:11:42,850
I'm pretty picky
when it comes to eating donuts.

1210
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:50,410
I only like the chocolate ones, the jelly filled
ones, the sugar ones and the cinnamon ones.

1211
01:11:51,381 --> 01:11:55,260
You gotta love them donuts,
you just gotta love them donuts.

1212
01:11:55,360 --> 01:12:00,870
But seriously, I went to Catholic school
and it was really strange because...

1213
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:05,969
there were all these nuns running around,
and none of them were married.

1214
01:12:10,282 --> 01:12:14,224
Gooey... chocolate... donut

1215
01:12:59,260 --> 01:13:01,718
What's the matter, baby?
Did you have a bad dream?

1216
01:13:02,540 --> 01:13:05,969
Oh... No Sean, I'm okay.

1217
01:13:06,470 --> 01:13:08,652
Aw, Freaky'll make it all better.

1218
01:13:10,290 --> 01:13:12,246
Let me get you a glass of water baby, hmm?

1219
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:16,070
Or maybe Freaky can find you a donut...

1220
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:19,626
Cause I know you like the chocolate ones,
the jelly ones, the honey dipped ones?

1221
01:13:19,630 --> 01:13:20,918
Yeah, that's funny!

1222
01:13:22,340 --> 01:13:23,996
Alright, everybody, listen up!

1223
01:13:24,005 --> 01:13:26,410
We've got three new games
on the schedule this month.

1224
01:13:26,420 --> 01:13:29,110
We're playing Alexander, Peck and BC.

1225
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:32,100
- THOSE ARE ALL PUSSY TEAMS!
- YEAH!

1226
01:13:32,138 --> 01:13:36,340
Alexander and BC are on the road.
We're playing Peck here next weekend.

1227
01:13:36,350 --> 01:13:39,180
Hey didn't BC kick
the fuck out of us last year?

1228
01:13:39,829 --> 01:13:40,850
Yes they did.

1229
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:44,640
- THEY'RE ALL PUSSIES!
- YEAH!

1230
01:13:44,656 --> 01:13:47,940
Alright, any of you new fellas who
don't have jerseys yet, talk to Malarkey.

1231
01:13:47,950 --> 01:13:49,692
MALARKEY'S A PUSSY!

1232
01:13:51,338 --> 01:13:53,061
Christ, you don't have to
raise your hand, Felix!

1233
01:13:53,070 --> 01:13:54,534
Oh... Okay.

1234
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:59,120
Are we playing
<i>Peck University</i> Peck University?

1235
01:13:59,470 --> 01:14:00,368
Yeah, that's right.

1236
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:04,234
- PECK'S FUCKING PUSSIES!
- YEAH!

1237
01:14:04,510 --> 01:14:05,632
Alright, anyone else?

1238
01:14:05,936 --> 01:14:10,608
Okay, then, we're running to the reservoir.
Last one back has to eat a spoonful of mud!

1239
01:14:10,610 --> 01:14:12,922
LET'S GO!

1240
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:17,141
Maybe you'll get injured.

1241
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:19,164
I'm not afraid of the guy.

1242
01:14:20,106 --> 01:14:21,765
But I've seen this guy, Felix.

1243
01:14:21,770 --> 01:14:24,732
He's gotta be 6'5, 220 pounds.

1244
01:14:25,330 --> 01:14:29,260
Now I'm no carnival employee but
you couldn't be more than 150 pounds.

1245
01:14:29,770 --> 01:14:32,330
And how tall are you? 5'5? 5'6?

1246
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:33,868
I'm 5'9.

1247
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:37,638
Felix, rugby is a full contact sport.

1248
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:40,330
It's a sport which not only allows...

1249
01:14:40,340 --> 01:14:44,709
but actually encourages one player to
legally kick the crap out of another player.

1250
01:14:46,910 --> 01:14:50,426
You got on the rugby team because you
wanted to show Suzanne you're as tough as Traci.

1251
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:52,101
No, that's really not the case.

1252
01:14:52,110 --> 01:14:53,380
That is <i>so</i> the case.

1253
01:14:53,390 --> 01:14:54,602
Okay, so it is the case.

1254
01:14:54,821 --> 01:14:59,520
But by virtue of being on that team
you're now about to get your ass handed to you!

1255
01:14:59,530 --> 01:15:02,433
By the very guy you were
tryin' to prove you're as tough as.

1256
01:15:03,610 --> 01:15:06,497
Are you not struck
dumb by the irony of this?

1257
01:15:13,370 --> 01:15:14,980
You familiar with Johnny Cash?

1258
01:15:14,992 --> 01:15:16,060
The man in black?

1259
01:15:16,070 --> 01:15:19,220
He wrote a song called "A Boy Named Sue."
You know what that song's about?

1260
01:15:19,230 --> 01:15:21,456
Is it about a boy named Sue?

1261
01:15:21,610 --> 01:15:23,254
That's right wiseguy...

1262
01:15:23,376 --> 01:15:27,845
It's about a deadbeat dad who has a son
and he wants him to be a tough motherfucker.

1263
01:15:27,850 --> 01:15:30,544
So he names the boy Sue,
'cause he knows with a name like that...

1264
01:15:30,550 --> 01:15:33,334
The kid'll get into a fight
every single day of his life.

1265
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:37,605
Sure enough, kid turns out to be
a big, nasty, prick!

1266
01:15:38,117 --> 01:15:41,018
Only problem is that he turns out
to be such a nasty prick, that he...

1267
01:15:41,020 --> 01:15:44,480
hunts down his deadbeat father
and he shoots him in the face!

1268
01:15:44,490 --> 01:15:46,314
For naming him "Sue" in the first place.

1269
01:15:46,580 --> 01:15:49,265
I don't think that's
how the song really ends.

1270
01:15:53,434 --> 01:15:54,853
Well, don't you worry about it,

1271
01:15:54,869 --> 01:15:58,026
because somehow,
somewhere about 20 years ago,

1272
01:15:58,030 --> 01:16:01,905
this guy Traci's psychotic
parents had the same idea.

1273
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:07,089
So I'm afraid, Felix, what you have
on your hands is tough, Traci Shannon.

1274
01:16:07,522 --> 01:16:09,522
A guy with not only two first names,

1275
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:11,569
but two girl's first names!

1276
01:16:11,989 --> 01:16:16,980
The guy who's the meanest, baddest,
toughest guy in the east and he's gonna unload...

1277
01:16:16,990 --> 01:16:22,890
Fifteen plus years of
mental torture on your sorry ass!

1278
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:24,406
You're enjoying this.

1279
01:16:25,790 --> 01:16:28,342
I admit... It amuses me.

1280
01:16:30,030 --> 01:16:31,270
But I've got a plan.

1281
01:16:32,010 --> 01:16:35,413
A way out of this...
But it's not easy.

1282
01:16:40,430 --> 01:16:42,268
Lay your arm on the end of this table.

1283
01:16:42,810 --> 01:16:43,860
What are you gonna do?

1284
01:16:43,870 --> 01:16:45,062
I'm gonna break it!

1285
01:16:46,770 --> 01:16:47,686
Please!

1286
01:16:48,101 --> 01:16:50,400
Felix, your only choice is to quit.

1287
01:16:50,410 --> 01:16:52,988
Easy, la tigra... I'm not gonna quit.

1288
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:56,540
So you're just gonna let
this guy beat you up in public?

1289
01:16:56,850 --> 01:16:58,460
In front of the whole school?

1290
01:16:58,710 --> 01:17:00,049
In front of Suzanne?

1291
01:17:00,928 --> 01:17:03,125
Everyone's gonna be
showin' up to see one thing,

1292
01:17:03,136 --> 01:17:06,730
to see you fight this guy.
And you're gonna get walloped!

1293
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:08,929
- Walloped?
- Walloped!

1294
01:17:10,890 --> 01:17:12,556
Gimme the arm, Felix!

1295
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:31,088
Welcome to Rick Johnson's Pizzeria.
May I help you?

1296
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:34,385
Uh... yeah, I'll have...

1297
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:35,718
I'm sorry, just a moment.

1298
01:17:36,370 --> 01:17:39,372
Rick Johnson's Pizzeria,
Rick Johnson speaking.

1299
01:17:44,390 --> 01:17:49,665
That's two large Rick Johnsons, one...
Rick Johnson's curly fries and a Rick Johnson shake?

1300
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:51,222
Twenty minutes.

1301
01:17:52,261 --> 01:17:53,370
Dominco!

1302
01:17:53,380 --> 01:17:54,470
Order to go.

1303
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:55,782
Si, Senor Johnson.

1304
01:17:56,110 --> 01:17:57,780
May I help you, ladies?

1305
01:17:57,790 --> 01:18:01,105
Yeah. I'll have a Rick Johnson with broccoli...

1306
01:18:01,270 --> 01:18:05,105
- A... Rick Johnson-
- Dominco, order to go!

1307
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:07,505
I'm sorry.

1308
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:12,256
A Rick Johnson with broccoli,
a Rick Johnson side salad and a shake.

1309
01:18:13,410 --> 01:18:15,820
We don't serve "shakes".

1310
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:18,182
The guy on the phone just ordered one.

1311
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:20,421
He ordered a <i>Rick Johnson</i> shake.

1312
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:22,604
Alright...

1313
01:18:22,890 --> 01:18:25,494
I'll have a <i>Rick Johnson</i> shake, please.

1314
01:18:26,380 --> 01:18:27,302
And for you?

1315
01:18:28,976 --> 01:18:31,650
Um... I'll just have a...

1316
01:18:31,664 --> 01:18:38,740
Rick Johnson side salad, a Rick Johnson
dill pickle and a Rick Johnson salsa water.

1317
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:41,457
Very good.

1318
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:43,782
Take a seat, I'll have
Rick Johnson bring it out to you.

1319
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:49,270
So, what's up with Freaky?
Have you called him?

1320
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:50,252
What?

1321
01:18:50,522 --> 01:18:53,770
Jesus Christ, it was one night!
It's not like we're going out.

1322
01:18:53,780 --> 01:18:56,118
Okay, I was just asking!

1323
01:18:56,470 --> 01:18:58,769
I'm sorry, it's just...

1324
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:01,404
I actually like the guy.

1325
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:02,748
But...

1326
01:19:05,390 --> 01:19:07,354
He gets into your dreams.

1327
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:08,657
Pickles.

1328
01:19:14,421 --> 01:19:17,790
What's the deal with Felix?
I mean, this whose rugby thing is just crazy!

1329
01:19:17,802 --> 01:19:18,693
I know!

1330
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:20,017
Isn't it bizarre?

1331
01:19:20,270 --> 01:19:22,640
But I think it's kinda
sweet though, you know?

1332
01:19:22,650 --> 01:19:24,165
That he's trying to impress me?

1333
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:25,946
Well what did Traci say?

1334
01:19:26,330 --> 01:19:27,029
About what?

1335
01:19:28,501 --> 01:19:29,300
About the game.

1336
01:19:30,130 --> 01:19:30,954
What game?

1337
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:34,869
The rugby game, Suzanne?

1338
01:19:35,630 --> 01:19:37,009
What rugby game?

1339
01:19:38,117 --> 01:19:44,730
Even if you buzzed my arms and legs off
with a high powered chainsaw and left me for dead...

1340
01:19:44,740 --> 01:19:50,625
I would find a way to drag my bloody
stump of a body onto that field Saturday.

1341
01:19:50,746 --> 01:19:52,790
I am playing in that game!

1342
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,020
Goddamn it!

1343
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:56,310
Promise me you won't hurt him, Traci!

1344
01:19:56,340 --> 01:20:01,212
Well, you know a promise like that would
compromise my integrity as a rugby player.

1345
01:20:01,285 --> 01:20:02,000
Traci!

1346
01:20:02,010 --> 01:20:03,062
Suzanne!

1347
01:20:03,380 --> 01:20:05,233
I am going to play!

1348
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:14,600
You're not playin' in that game on Saturday!

1349
01:20:14,618 --> 01:20:15,200
Hi, Suzanne!

1350
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:16,785
You're not playing in that game!

1351
01:20:16,951 --> 01:20:17,700
Suzanne, don't worry about-

1352
01:20:17,710 --> 01:20:20,426
Shut up, Felix! You don't know
what you're getting yourself into!

1353
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:22,214
I can take care of myself!

1354
01:20:22,450 --> 01:20:24,892
Traci is gonna kill you!

1355
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:28,200
What happened to your arm?

1356
01:20:28,213 --> 01:20:29,030
Nothing.

1357
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:30,432
- What do you mean, nothing?
- Ow!

1358
01:20:30,437 --> 01:20:32,378
Look at that bruise!
Did you get that playing rugby?

1359
01:20:32,380 --> 01:20:33,238
No.

1360
01:20:34,410 --> 01:20:36,112
You should have told me about Saturday.

1361
01:20:36,378 --> 01:20:37,760
I didn't wanna make a big deal out of it.

1362
01:20:37,776 --> 01:20:38,901
It's just another game.

1363
01:20:38,910 --> 01:20:40,170
Oh, just another game?

1364
01:20:40,180 --> 01:20:42,220
And how many games
have you been in so far?

1365
01:20:42,380 --> 01:20:43,212
None.

1366
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:46,145
I want you out of that game on Saturday.

1367
01:20:46,660 --> 01:20:49,377
I don't think you understand.
I can't! I'm on the team.

1368
01:20:49,536 --> 01:20:51,710
Felix, I think you're very macho, okay?

1369
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:54,794
I think you're much more macho than Traci.
I really mean that, okay?

1370
01:20:54,805 --> 01:20:55,950
This has nothing to do with that.

1371
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:57,584
I just want to play rugby, that's it. I-

1372
01:20:57,590 --> 01:20:58,550
Bye, Suzanne.

1373
01:21:07,973 --> 01:21:09,900
- Hey, Greg.
- Hey, Felix.

1374
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:13,808
Hey what's this I hear about
you and some Peck check?

1375
01:21:14,010 --> 01:21:14,876
It's nothin'!

1376
01:21:16,010 --> 01:21:16,970
Where'd you hear about that?

1377
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:20,394
Hey look, Felix, you know if you want
out of this game on Saturday, it's okay by me.

1378
01:21:20,530 --> 01:21:21,898
I'm playing on Saturday.

1379
01:21:21,950 --> 01:21:22,625
Good.

1380
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,070
This fella has a female's name anyway.
How tough could he be, right?

1381
01:21:26,778 --> 01:21:29,990
Felix, you got a grudge match
with some fuckin' Peck squid?

1382
01:21:30,190 --> 01:21:30,870
Yeah.

1383
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:33,009
You're gonna fuck him up, huh?

1384
01:21:33,410 --> 01:21:35,254
Uh... Yeah!

1385
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:41,040
Hey, I didn't know
you were dating Suzanne McKenna.

1386
01:21:41,450 --> 01:21:42,130
Yeah, I am.

1387
01:21:42,140 --> 01:21:43,377
She's hot!

1388
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:44,305
Thanks!

1389
01:21:45,890 --> 01:21:47,185
I mean, <i>yeah</i> she is!

1390
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:52,780
Who's that guy in Peck?
Her old boyfriend?

1391
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:53,520
Yeah.

1392
01:21:53,550 --> 01:21:55,232
Are you gonna bust his ass?

1393
01:21:55,450 --> 01:21:56,640
Uh... yeah.

1394
01:21:57,450 --> 01:21:58,556
I'm gonna kill him!

1395
01:21:59,750 --> 01:22:03,110
We're gonna sack his crack! Yeah!

1396
01:22:04,666 --> 01:22:07,546
It's bumpy over here, it's bumpy there,

1397
01:22:07,550 --> 01:22:08,972
That was attached.

1398
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:14,097
Look, Alaska is cold, Antarctica is cold.

1399
01:22:14,230 --> 01:22:15,745
They were attached.

1400
01:22:17,024 --> 01:22:20,160
- See look at it. Hot.
- Hot.

1401
01:22:20,170 --> 01:22:22,625
- So?
- They were attached!

1402
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:23,730
Exactly!

1403
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:26,160
- You got it?
- I got it.

1404
01:22:26,170 --> 01:22:28,140
- Mystic pizza.
- Yeah!

1405
01:22:28,970 --> 01:22:30,854
Are you sure
Winona Ryder's in this movie?

1406
01:22:31,070 --> 01:22:32,400
Suzanne called.

1407
01:22:32,670 --> 01:22:33,720
When did she call?

1408
01:22:33,733 --> 01:22:35,541
About a minute ago.
I told her you'd be right back.

1409
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:38,720
Ah whatever. I'm not calling her,
I've heard what she has to say.

1410
01:22:39,914 --> 01:22:43,696
So you're telling me, we get to see
Julia Roberts naked in this movie?

1411
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:44,981
That's what I heard.

1412
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:47,490
- Full frontal?
- I don't know.

1413
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:49,729
It just doesn't make any sense!

1414
01:22:50,140 --> 01:22:51,921
She's too big a star.

1415
01:22:52,138 --> 01:22:55,765
Well, you can be a big star and do nudity.

1416
01:22:55,770 --> 01:22:59,168
You know if it's a great
piece of work, one of the classics.

1417
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:00,182
Like what?

1418
01:23:03,450 --> 01:23:04,572
Wizard of Oz.

1419
01:23:06,580 --> 01:23:08,177
I'd go see a nude Wizard of Oz.

1420
01:23:09,740 --> 01:23:12,582
I was in a nude production
of Wizard of Oz in high school.

1421
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:16,364
Played the tin man.

1422
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:23,142
You don't know the full meaning of the
Lollipop Guild till you've seen 2 dozen naked midgets.

1423
01:23:25,386 --> 01:23:29,980
<i>That was "Do you feel strange" by Boom Hank here on Cooperzone W-C-O-B WCOB</i>

1424
01:23:29,994 --> 01:23:33,770
<i>Joining me now is Dan Fey
of the Cooper University rugby team.</i>

1425
01:23:33,780 --> 01:23:35,253
- Who's Dan Fey?
- <i>How you doin' Danny?</i>

1426
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:36,977
- I dunno
- <i>Hey dude, great.</i>

1427
01:23:37,221 --> 01:23:39,680
<i>I hear we got a good game shaking up on Saturday.</i>

1428
01:23:39,690 --> 01:23:40,830
<i>Oh, hell yeah!</i>

1429
01:23:40,842 --> 01:23:43,493
<i>Our starting right wing,
Felix Bean, has personally promised...</i>

1430
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:45,852
to kick the ass of one of the Peck chumps.

1431
01:23:45,890 --> 01:23:49,157
- You did?
- <i>The guy's name is Traci or something like that.</i>

1432
01:23:49,168 --> 01:23:51,730
- He's gonna kill you!
- <i>Rugby player named Traci, huh?</i>

1433
01:23:51,749 --> 01:23:54,965
<i>You know what they say about the guyses with the girls's names?</i>

1434
01:23:54,970 --> 01:23:58,364
- <i>No I don't.</i>
- <i>Well show up on Saturday and find out.</i>

1435
01:23:58,458 --> 01:24:01,020
<i>Go get 'em, Felix! Make us all proud!</i>

1436
01:24:01,034 --> 01:24:04,805
<i>Up next, a new tune by Belial Sausage.</i>

1437
01:24:06,090 --> 01:24:07,926
What the fuck was that about?

1438
01:24:08,090 --> 01:24:10,332
Well, at least there's
no way Suzanne was listening.

1439
01:24:10,430 --> 01:24:11,473
How do you know?

1440
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:12,721
She would have called by-

1441
01:24:14,362 --> 01:24:15,648
- I'm not here.
- I'm not here either.

1442
01:24:15,650 --> 01:24:16,860
- I'm not here.
- Me either.

1443
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:22,806
<i>Greetings Earthlings. At the laser, please commence
your communication, and then take me to your leader!</i>

1444
01:24:23,470 --> 01:24:25,750
That's the funniest message I've ever heard.

1445
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:29,700
- <i>Felix! Felix, pick up the goddamn phone...</i>
- Oh shit!

1446
01:24:29,700 --> 01:24:29,718
- She's pissed!
- <i>Pick up the phone, Felix!</i>
- <i>Felix! Felix, pick up the goddamn phone...</i>
- Oh shit!

1447
01:24:29,718 --> 01:24:32,250
- She's pissed!
- <i>Pick up the phone, Felix!</i>

1448
01:24:32,260 --> 01:24:33,354
- Maybe I should pick it up.
- <i>Felix!</i>

1449
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:35,630
- No
- <i>I know you're there...</i>

1450
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:37,217
Oh, this is awful!

1451
01:24:38,050 --> 01:24:42,070
- <i>Zach! I know you're there!</i>
- Ha ha, Zach!

1452
01:24:42,170 --> 01:24:45,594
<i>Felix, I heard the radio declaration,.Great job!</i>

1453
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:47,814
- Hang up for God's sakes!
- <i>Pick it up, Felix!</i>

1454
01:24:48,940 --> 01:24:51,926
<i>Alright, fine! Call me the second you get in!</i>

1455
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:57,370
Alright! Hey, crank up the movie!

1456
01:24:57,380 --> 01:24:59,862
- Yeah!
- You're safe now, son.

1457
01:24:59,910 --> 01:25:01,830
And you're sure Winona Ryder's in this flick?

1458
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:03,132
I'm pretty sure.

1459
01:25:03,820 --> 01:25:05,681
I just love dem little, naked women.

1460
01:25:10,850 --> 01:25:12,421
I wanna hear more about
this rugby thing.

1461
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:14,901
- You don't want to know!
- No c'mon, seriously, tell me!

1462
01:25:14,910 --> 01:25:15,765
- No.
- No, really!

1463
01:25:15,770 --> 01:25:16,902
Is Felix here?

1464
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:18,316
Yeah.

1465
01:25:19,070 --> 01:25:20,556
Okay, I'm inside.

1466
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:24,444
Suzanne wants to speak to you.

1467
01:25:27,710 --> 01:25:28,956
It's over.

1468
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:30,530
You're breaking up with me?

1469
01:25:30,544 --> 01:25:32,097
Yeah, I'm breaking up with you!

1470
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:35,408
So now one of my ex boyfriends is gonna
beat up another one of my ex boyfriends,

1471
01:25:35,410 --> 01:25:37,409
and I sure am sorry I'm gonna miss it!

1472
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,308
Goodbye, Felix!

1473
01:25:50,410 --> 01:25:52,540
I gave you a chance and you fucked up!

1474
01:25:52,580 --> 01:25:54,401
- Lemme try again!
- No!

1475
01:25:55,950 --> 01:25:57,345
Please, Felix!

1476
01:25:57,640 --> 01:25:59,516
I won't just bruise it this time!

1477
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:02,506
- I can break it!
- Enough with the arm!

1478
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:09,761
- Hey Felix!
- Hey Greg.

1479
01:26:10,050 --> 01:26:12,198
I knew you'd show!
You just won me three quid!

1480
01:26:12,416 --> 01:26:15,312
Fuck, fuck fuck! Dollars! Dollars!

1481
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:16,476
Why wouldn't I show?

1482
01:26:16,730 --> 01:26:18,390
What? I said you would show.

1483
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:19,558
Oh, shit!

1484
01:26:20,186 --> 01:26:21,810
I did not think you were gonna show up.

1485
01:26:21,820 --> 01:26:23,562
That's right, you owe me
three bucks you fuck!

1486
01:26:23,570 --> 01:26:26,881
You know I'll fuckin' pay you.
I just don't have any money... right now.

1487
01:26:27,390 --> 01:26:29,761
- You got some balls.
- Oh yeah?

1488
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:32,172
I went to hockey camp with that guy.

1489
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:34,022
He's a pussy, right?

1490
01:26:34,290 --> 01:26:35,254
Well...

1491
01:26:36,192 --> 01:26:37,730
You still wanna play, right Felix?

1492
01:26:37,740 --> 01:26:38,609
I'm playin'!

1493
01:26:39,034 --> 01:26:40,490
Alright, that's good enough for me.

1494
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:42,038
Alright everybody, let's ride the top!

1495
01:26:42,330 --> 01:26:43,254
Which one is he?

1496
01:26:43,730 --> 01:26:45,153
I can't see him right now.

1497
01:26:45,830 --> 01:26:47,622
He's in that huddle somewhere.

1498
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:49,862
Oh wait.

1499
01:26:50,660 --> 01:26:51,740
There he is.

1500
01:26:52,330 --> 01:26:53,222
Which one?

1501
01:26:53,790 --> 01:26:55,926
He's the guy who's pointing at me right now.

1502
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:00,609
He looks like a pussy.

1503
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:03,201
That's her walking toward us.

1504
01:27:03,780 --> 01:27:05,094
She looks pissed!

1505
01:27:07,460 --> 01:27:10,577
Okay, Traci! I broke up with Felix,
so you don't have to beat him up now!

1506
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:12,849
Why do you think I'm gonna beat him up?

1507
01:27:13,082 --> 01:27:14,240
We're just playing a game.

1508
01:27:14,250 --> 01:27:16,113
Traci, I'm not dating him anymore!

1509
01:27:17,180 --> 01:27:19,809
- Get lost!
- Oh, sorry!

1510
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:22,918
I thought you said she broke up with him.

1511
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:24,198
She did.

1512
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:27,905
And she broke up with you too, right?

1513
01:27:28,350 --> 01:27:29,078
Right.

1514
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:35,857
So I guess she's available, huh?

1515
01:27:40,290 --> 01:27:43,450
Okay, look. I've had enough of this!
You're not playing in this game!

1516
01:27:43,460 --> 01:27:44,245
Yes I am!

1517
01:27:44,437 --> 01:27:45,430
I'm warning you, Felix!

1518
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:47,862
I'm giving you one last chance to stop this!

1519
01:27:48,010 --> 01:27:49,302
One last chance!

1520
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:51,313
I'm playing!

1521
01:27:51,830 --> 01:27:52,705
Okay!

1522
01:27:53,060 --> 01:27:54,038
That's it!

1523
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:51,104
Okay folks, I hate to break up this game.

1524
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:53,254
Which one of you is Felix Bean?

1525
01:28:53,650 --> 01:28:55,078
Why? What's going on?

1526
01:28:55,370 --> 01:28:56,972
We're gonna have to take him in.

1527
01:28:57,010 --> 01:28:59,489
He's wanted in connection
with breaking and entering.

1528
01:29:04,030 --> 01:29:06,460
- Now which of you is Bean?
- Look, Officer Reese...

1529
01:29:06,740 --> 01:29:08,684
Felix is an important player on our team!

1530
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:10,481
This is an important game!

1531
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:12,065
And we really need him!

1532
01:29:12,496 --> 01:29:15,397
Do you suppose you could let him play
the game and you could talk to him after the game?

1533
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:17,173
- Well... I really-
- <i>C'mon officer, let him play!</i>

1534
01:29:17,180 --> 01:29:18,550
Let him play!

1535
01:29:18,773 --> 01:29:21,424
- Yeah, Let him play!
- Let him play!

1536
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:36,800
<i>Let him play! Let him play!</i>

1537
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:47,324
Settle down!

1538
01:29:48,270 --> 01:29:52,481
Well, no... no way! He's coming with us.

1539
01:29:52,700 --> 01:29:54,122
Who's Felix Bean?

1540
01:30:02,950 --> 01:30:04,124
I'm Felix Bean.

1541
01:30:04,910 --> 01:30:07,292
No, I'm Felix Bean.

1542
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:09,930
No. I'm Felix Bean.

1543
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:14,682
<i>I'm Felix Bean! I'm Felix Bean!</i>

1544
01:30:17,930 --> 01:30:24,166
<i>I'm Felix Bean! I'm Felix Bean!</i>

1545
01:30:31,264 --> 01:30:35,130
Alright, alright! You're all Felix Bean!

1546
01:30:35,140 --> 01:30:37,105
Jesus, you're all Felix Bean!

1547
01:30:37,740 --> 01:30:39,660
Go ahead and play your game, already!

1548
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:44,940
Higgins, go up to the office and pull
Bean's picture. We'll get him after the game.

1549
01:30:58,842 --> 01:31:00,020
Why didn't you take him?

1550
01:31:00,030 --> 01:31:02,796
He's the third man! He's the third man!

1551
01:31:03,264 --> 01:31:05,744
He's not going anywhere,
we'll get him after the game!

1552
01:31:05,749 --> 01:31:07,760
No, you have to get him now!

1553
01:31:07,770 --> 01:31:09,440
You have to get him now!

1554
01:31:09,450 --> 01:31:10,646
Easy!

1555
01:31:10,650 --> 01:31:12,604
We'll get him after the game!

1556
01:31:15,790 --> 01:31:18,828
You have to get him now,
you have to get him now...

1557
01:32:11,890 --> 01:32:13,014
What's up, baby?

1558
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:28,641
Suzanne!

1559
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:46,737
Suzanne!

1560
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:08,224
Hey...

1561
01:35:08,730 --> 01:35:09,990
Here's your neck brace.

1562
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:12,710
That is <i>not</i> my neck brace!

1563
01:35:12,820 --> 01:35:16,741
Look, if it's sympathy you want
from me, you're not gonna get it.

1564
01:35:16,820 --> 01:35:17,862
I'm sorry.

1565
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:19,078
Too late for that!

1566
01:35:19,340 --> 01:35:21,708
Oh hey! Thanks for turning
me in to security, by the way.

1567
01:35:21,861 --> 01:35:23,680
I did that for your own good!

1568
01:35:23,690 --> 01:35:25,500
They should've stopped you from playing!

1569
01:35:25,510 --> 01:35:27,953
- Well they didn't.
- I can see that!

1570
01:35:28,170 --> 01:35:29,457
Did they arrest you?

1571
01:35:29,580 --> 01:35:32,458
- No. They felt sorry for me.
- God!

1572
01:35:33,170 --> 01:35:35,185
Suzanne, what do you want me to do?

1573
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:57,985
What the hell are you doin' in my car?

1574
01:35:58,110 --> 01:35:59,958
I can't keep up with you without it.

1575
01:36:00,450 --> 01:36:01,910
Suzanne, I'm sorry!

1576
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:04,130
Save it, Felix! I'm not interested!

1577
01:36:04,144 --> 01:36:05,861
No, I really mean it! I'm sorry!

1578
01:36:05,872 --> 01:36:07,180
Oh, you're sorry now?

1579
01:36:07,194 --> 01:36:10,773
After you go through all that macho
bullshit to get the crap kicked out of you?

1580
01:36:10,780 --> 01:36:13,140
I did <i>not</i> get the crap kicked out of me!

1581
01:36:13,157 --> 01:36:14,320
Listen to you!

1582
01:36:14,330 --> 01:36:18,694
You have a sprained neck, bruises on you face,
a broken arm and you're wearing a body brace!

1583
01:36:18,837 --> 01:36:20,394
Felix, you're wearing a body brace!

1584
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:23,750
Okay, I made a mistake!
But it's not my fault!

1585
01:36:24,190 --> 01:36:26,950
I need you to think I'm a tough guy!
That's instinct!

1586
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:28,710
I have instincts!

1587
01:36:28,725 --> 01:36:33,030
I have to fight the other bulls,
I have to breed and I have to protect my offspring,

1588
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:33,990
I can't help it!

1589
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,573
My God, you're insane!

1590
01:36:35,573 --> 01:36:35,606
C'mon Suzanne!
My God, you're insane!

1591
01:36:35,606 --> 01:36:36,714
C'mon Suzanne!

1592
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:39,201
I think I'm just gonna
give up on men for a while.

1593
01:36:39,216 --> 01:36:43,018
Oh, that's good. Because I think
I can pretty much take on any woman in a fight.

1594
01:36:43,029 --> 01:36:43,370
Leave me alone.

1595
01:36:43,386 --> 01:36:45,605
- <i>Get outta the road, shithead!</i>
- Fuck you! Fuck you!

1596
01:36:45,610 --> 01:36:47,441
Felix, you're being irrational!

1597
01:36:47,584 --> 01:36:49,429
- Suzanne you can't do this to me.
- <i>Fucking asshole!</i>

1598
01:36:49,430 --> 01:36:51,536
Fuck you you son of a bitch!

1599
01:36:51,546 --> 01:36:52,970
Felix, you're out of control!

1600
01:36:52,980 --> 01:36:55,770
Those are the bulls!
Those are the other bulls!

1601
01:36:55,780 --> 01:36:57,302
Felix!

1602
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:02,129
Oh shit! Felix?

1603
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:07,585
- Ouch.
- Felix!

1604
01:37:10,510 --> 01:37:12,694
Oh I love you Suzanne!

1605
01:37:14,190 --> 01:37:15,621
I love you too, Felix.

1606
01:37:15,630 --> 01:37:18,257
- I'm sorry.
- I know you are.

1607
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:19,660
I really mean it!

1608
01:37:20,060 --> 01:37:21,398
I know you do.

1609
01:37:21,660 --> 01:37:23,452
Now move over and let me drive.

1610
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:24,998
Will you take me back?

1611
01:37:25,090 --> 01:37:26,812
Of course I will!

1612
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:29,180
Now move over and let me drive!

1613
01:37:29,560 --> 01:37:30,465
Why?

1614
01:37:30,660 --> 01:37:33,254
Because I'm gonna drive us home, Felix.

1615
01:37:33,754 --> 01:37:35,510
Well don't you think I should drive?

1616
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:36,213
Why?

1617
01:37:37,050 --> 01:37:38,929
Well, I am the man after all.

1618
01:37:40,580 --> 01:37:42,833
Move over now, Felix!

1619
01:37:51,750 --> 01:37:54,806
So I guess you're gonna
miss the rest of the rugby season.

1620
01:37:54,981 --> 01:37:56,740
Greg asked me if I'd be mascot.

1621
01:37:56,750 --> 01:37:59,057
Aw! Isn't that nice?

1622
01:38:00,346 --> 01:38:03,970
Oh I saw Marjorie at the track yesterday.
You know, the one that Zach likes?

1623
01:38:03,989 --> 01:38:04,810
Oh yeah!

1624
01:38:04,820 --> 01:38:06,566
I found out what the deal is.

1625
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:07,756
Are you ready?

1626
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:11,206
She really likes Zach, but...

1627
01:38:11,420 --> 01:38:15,105
She's already seeing some guy
who's away in Switzerland this semester.

1628
01:38:15,340 --> 01:38:16,273
Jesus!

1629
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:19,370
Does Zach know about the Swiss mister?

1630
01:38:19,380 --> 01:38:22,880
Well... I told Emily so
I'm sure it got to Zach by now.

1631
01:38:23,060 --> 01:38:24,300
That's a safe bet.

1632
01:38:25,570 --> 01:38:28,620
So are you servicing the
community with Matt and Grogan today?

1633
01:38:28,750 --> 01:38:29,452
Nope.

1634
01:38:29,830 --> 01:38:31,713
They actually got stuck with the night shift.

1635
01:38:33,370 --> 01:38:35,974
How much garbage
can they pick up in the dark?

1636
01:38:40,933 --> 01:38:42,262
Shh, shh, shh!

1637
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:44,220
Look! Look!

1638
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:45,921
I- I think I heard somethin'!

1639
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:48,817
Freeze!

1640
01:38:49,690 --> 01:38:51,573
Dude!
