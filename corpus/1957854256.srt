[Lane clears throat]

3
00:00:33,185 --> 00:00:34,978
I'm gonna go.

4
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,104
I can't.

5
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,568
You'll still get paid,

6
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,321
and I can come back
tomorrow, and I'll pick it up.

7
00:00:46,365 --> 00:00:48,116
I might donate it. I could--

8
00:00:50,202 --> 00:00:51,328
What is that smell?

9
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:53,330
Is that...

10
00:00:53,372 --> 00:00:54,998
like, feet?

11
00:00:56,416 --> 00:00:57,921
Do people get nervous?

12
00:00:58,604 --> 00:01:00,937
That really might--
I might believe.

13
00:01:02,728 --> 00:01:04,540
Oh, it's period blood, right?

14
00:01:04,594 --> 00:01:06,326
It's, like--and
there's, like, iron in it.

15
00:01:06,385 --> 00:01:09,764
I can--do you guys do turkeys?

16
00:01:09,857 --> 00:01:12,943
Yeah, we only--we only
do it during Thanksgiving.

17
00:01:13,225 --> 00:01:14,895
I hate turkey, and that's weird

18
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,171
'cause that's how this
whole thing started.

19
00:01:16,196 --> 00:01:17,405
It was Thanksgiving.

20
00:01:17,756 --> 00:01:20,036
I made the Tofurky, and
my sister made turkey.

21
00:01:20,864 --> 00:01:22,832
And it was that moment,
like, at the end of the night

22
00:01:22,857 --> 00:01:24,342
when it was just me by myself.

23
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:26,141
My nephew started
throwing up or something.

24
00:01:26,984 --> 00:01:28,928
And I was alone, and it was
the first time I could kind of,

25
00:01:28,953 --> 00:01:31,321
like, hear myself think.

26
00:01:33,298 --> 00:01:35,926
And I realized what it was.

27
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:40,587
So I went to the refrigerator,
and I opened up the door,

28
00:01:40,612 --> 00:01:41,796
and I took off the tinfoil,

29
00:01:41,821 --> 00:01:44,030
and I just started putting
the turkey meat in my mouth.

30
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:48,759
I started eating like an animal
like I was mad and furious.

31
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:51,896
It was disgusting, and...

32
00:01:53,432 --> 00:01:55,058
it was so good.

33
00:01:57,268 --> 00:01:58,875
I'm vegan.

34
00:01:59,269 --> 00:02:01,180
I've been vegan since
I was in ninth grade,

35
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:03,963
and I'm, like,
obnoxious about it.

36
00:02:04,123 --> 00:02:05,550
I make people feel bad.

37
00:02:06,203 --> 00:02:08,630
I go around the country,
and I speak about the ease

38
00:02:08,655 --> 00:02:10,373
of the vegan lifestyle.

39
00:02:13,385 --> 00:02:14,485
What's your name?

40
00:02:14,853 --> 00:02:15,854
Chris.

41
00:02:16,163 --> 00:02:19,938
Chris. I'm Lane.

42
00:02:22,169 --> 00:02:24,254
So the thing is, Chris,

43
00:02:24,296 --> 00:02:28,091
there's this situation.

44
00:02:29,388 --> 00:02:32,295
And I'm not scared
of having a baby.

45
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,327
I'm scared of who I am
while I'm growing this baby.

46
00:02:36,352 --> 00:02:38,173
I don't recognize myself.

47
00:02:38,844 --> 00:02:40,179
I close my eyes at night,

48
00:02:40,204 --> 00:02:42,812
and I imagine that I'm
eating dead animals.

49
00:02:42,873 --> 00:02:44,833
Sometimes they're still
alive while I'm eating them.

50
00:02:45,035 --> 00:02:47,957
Like, a pig is looking
me in the eyes and crying,

51
00:02:47,982 --> 00:02:49,796
and I'm chewing on its leg.

52
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:51,613
Or a goat, a lamb.

53
00:02:51,693 --> 00:02:53,036
So the other night I
was in a restaurant,

54
00:02:53,061 --> 00:02:54,752
and this waiter walked
by with this plate

55
00:02:54,777 --> 00:02:58,443
of, like, frenched lamb.

56
00:02:58,468 --> 00:03:00,869
It was like a rack of--
you French the lamb.

57
00:03:01,028 --> 00:03:04,387
That sounds weird. But
I smelled it, and I saw it.

58
00:03:04,412 --> 00:03:06,249
And my body just
went towards it.

59
00:03:06,325 --> 00:03:08,761
I didn't--but I'm--

60
00:03:09,339 --> 00:03:10,912
and the thing is, I
have these hands

61
00:03:10,937 --> 00:03:15,491
with fingernails for
tearing apart flesh.

62
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:19,115
And I have molars
for smashing up bones.

63
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,875
And I have a brain
that can invent

64
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,862
and wield a knife for killing

65
00:03:25,887 --> 00:03:30,488
and carving up a food that I
so desperately want right now.

66
00:03:33,372 --> 00:03:35,123
And I hate myself for it.

67
00:03:44,376 --> 00:03:48,171
Oh, God. Whoa!

68
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:53,199
Oh, God.

69
00:03:55,594 --> 00:03:57,347
[laughs]

70
00:04:05,605 --> 00:04:09,083
You know, they did this, um,

71
00:04:09,568 --> 00:04:11,429
study in Ecuador

72
00:04:12,055 --> 00:04:16,059
where they left the heads
on the pigs for the day,

73
00:04:16,407 --> 00:04:18,065
and the sales plummeted.

74
00:04:18,477 --> 00:04:19,913
People can't handle this.

75
00:04:20,204 --> 00:04:22,164
They need to be
able to disassociate

76
00:04:22,189 --> 00:04:23,551
from where their
meat comes from.

77
00:04:23,576 --> 00:04:25,011
How fucked up is that?

78
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:26,931
Because if I died

79
00:04:27,785 --> 00:04:29,289
because somebody
wanted to fulfill

80
00:04:29,314 --> 00:04:31,916
as intense of a craving
as I have right now,

81
00:04:31,963 --> 00:04:33,942
I would want them to at
least acknowledge me.

82
00:04:34,104 --> 00:04:38,275
Say, "Thank you," or "Hi," or...

83
00:04:41,386 --> 00:04:42,630
Like, "Hi.

84
00:04:42,961 --> 00:04:45,613
Hello. Lamb, thank you.

85
00:04:46,605 --> 00:04:49,608
You were alive, and now
you're dead because of me.

86
00:04:51,321 --> 00:04:55,422
And Chris and I are
going to cut you up.

87
00:04:55,981 --> 00:04:57,615
And we're going to put
you in my refrigerator,

88
00:04:57,657 --> 00:04:58,876
and we're going to cook you.

89
00:04:58,984 --> 00:05:02,779
And I'm going to eat you
with my mouth and my teeth.

90
00:05:03,588 --> 00:05:08,426
And you're going to nourish
me and my 14-week-old fetus.

91
00:05:10,127 --> 00:05:11,634
And that's not fair.

92
00:05:14,904 --> 00:05:16,113
And maybe...

93
00:05:17,636 --> 00:05:20,735
there's some alternate universe

94
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,806
where you're pregnant,
and I'm lying on that table.

95
00:05:29,074 --> 00:05:33,369
But for right now, I
want to say thank you.

96
00:05:33,652 --> 00:05:34,611
Thank you.

97
00:05:36,655 --> 00:05:38,281
Thank you.

98
00:05:43,442 --> 00:05:46,278
Oh, God. Thank you. Sorry."

99
00:05:49,252 --> 00:05:52,708
Chris, tell me about this

100
00:05:53,092 --> 00:05:56,476
gorgeous, dead, sad animal.

101
00:05:56,906 --> 00:05:58,680
Well, she wasn't sad.

102
00:05:59,017 --> 00:06:00,977
It was a girl?

-[Chris] Yeah.
-It was a girl lamb.

104
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,666
She grew up on Stuart's Farm
about 30 minutes from here.

105
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:10,034
She was born near
the apple orchard.

106
00:06:10,299 --> 00:06:11,371
Always on a pasture.

107
00:06:11,396 --> 00:06:13,398
Lived with brothers, sisters.

108
00:06:13,692 --> 00:06:15,147
She was a happy lamb.

109
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:18,676
Never had a bad day
except maybe one.

110
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,042
And that would be
the day that I killed her

111
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:22,550
with the captive bolt gun.

112
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:25,486
Arguably, it was a
much better death

113
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:27,620
than if she would have
died of natural causes.

114
00:06:27,843 --> 00:06:29,210
But we don't know that.

115
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:31,941

You paid for her. Are
we going to do this?

Wow.

124
00:07:47,932 --> 00:07:50,538
My youngest was like,
"I can eat half a plate."

125
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,791
He suddenly respected me.

126
00:07:52,832 --> 00:07:55,794

made me a total weirdo.

I was gonna name her. I forgot.

I know that's probably
not a good idea, but--

131
00:08:21,286 --> 00:08:22,702
Well, you can name her now.

Ugh.

Yeah, it's a boy.
