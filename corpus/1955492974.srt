1
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:14,630
12 is the magic number.

2
00:00:14,631 --> 00:00:17,792
12 is divine.

3
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:25,345
12 is both the beginning
and the end of time.

4
00:00:43,393 --> 00:00:44,827
You must hurry.

5
00:00:44,828 --> 00:00:46,163
When it comes to building clocks, father,

6
00:00:46,164 --> 00:00:48,931
there is no such thing as hurry.

7
00:00:48,932 --> 00:00:50,933
Leave us, please.

8
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:56,238
The nazis have made a breakthrough.

9
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:57,340
Impossible.

10
00:00:57,341 --> 00:00:58,908
The prophesies are True.

11
00:01:00,077 --> 00:01:02,945
The end times are here.

12
00:01:21,465 --> 00:01:24,400
The scriptures say,
"There shall be upon this earth

13
00:01:24,401 --> 00:01:26,068
"a distress of nations.

14
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:29,305
"the power of heaven shall be shaken.

15
00:01:29,306 --> 00:01:30,940
"Nation will rise against Nation,

16
00:01:30,941 --> 00:01:32,209
kingdom against kingdom."

17
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:35,277
Luke 4:22. You know your apocalyptic verse.

18
00:01:35,278 --> 00:01:37,780
Claims of the end of
days are as old as time.

19
00:01:37,781 --> 00:01:40,282
Ever since the apostles wrote
those lines 2,000 years ago,

20
00:01:40,283 --> 00:01:43,119
every generation had thought it
applied to them and them alone,

21
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,853
and every time, they've been wrong.

22
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:46,823
Yes, but never before have the dead arisen.

23
00:01:51,261 --> 00:01:53,763
Make eye contact with no one.

24
00:02:01,905 --> 00:02:04,440
The nazis
appropriated this place a year ago.

25
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:06,809
They began their experiments
almost immediately.

26
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,345
Were it not for our unnamed "Friend,"

27
00:02:09,346 --> 00:02:11,514
We would never have known.

28
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,392
It's only a child.

29
00:02:22,393 --> 00:02:23,826
Born of no womb.

30
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,302
Run!

31
00:02:33,303 --> 00:02:34,537
Hey!

32
00:02:34,538 --> 00:02:37,773
Halt! Halt!

33
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,877
Halt!

34
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:43,379
Halt!

35
00:03:02,163 --> 00:03:04,181
The nazis cannot be stopped now.

36
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:05,585
They will come for us.

37
00:03:06,046 --> 00:03:07,458
Then we must fight back.

38
00:03:07,503 --> 00:03:09,995
We are too weak to fight back.

39
00:03:09,996 --> 00:03:12,464
But we may not be in the future.

40
00:03:12,465 --> 00:03:13,866
As Rosicruicians,

41
00:03:13,867 --> 00:03:15,433
we know the most important
thing for us to do now

42
00:03:15,434 --> 00:03:16,636
is to preserve that thing

43
00:03:16,637 --> 00:03:19,572
that lies in the tunnels
below this cathedral.

44
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:26,933
We can't do this.

45
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,249
A hundred generations have kept it hidden.

46
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,451
We're not worthy to make this decision.

47
00:03:32,452 --> 00:03:35,087
If we don't, and it falls into nazi hands,

48
00:03:35,088 --> 00:03:37,923
it will mean the end of
mankind as we know it.

49
00:03:50,637 --> 00:03:52,639
There is an SS convoy
two minutes behind me.

50
00:03:54,407 --> 00:03:57,042
If we leave now, we might still beat them.

51
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,047
Praise god for you, brother.

52
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:10,889
That's it.

53
00:04:19,165 --> 00:04:21,567
Godspeed.

54
00:04:29,142 --> 00:04:30,242
They're here!

55
00:04:30,243 --> 00:04:32,378
Barricade it!

56
00:04:56,636 --> 00:04:58,570
It is up to god now.

57
00:04:58,571 --> 00:05:02,574
Not even god Can help anymore.

58
00:05:02,575 --> 00:05:04,576
Only the 12 can.

59
00:05:13,118 --> 00:05:17,255
♪ So we'll start slow ♪

60
00:05:17,256 --> 00:05:19,290
Seriously, you gotta try this.

61
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,124
No, seriously,
I don't I have to try it.

62
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:22,259
You don't even know what
kind of meat that is.

63
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,362
And I don't care...

64
00:05:23,363 --> 00:05:25,396
on account of its deliciousness.

65
00:05:25,397 --> 00:05:26,763
Well, careful 'cause you
got a little hoof there

66
00:05:26,764 --> 00:05:28,167
- in your teeth.
- Mm? I like it.

67
00:05:28,168 --> 00:05:29,635
Yeah?

68
00:05:30,492 --> 00:05:31,271
It's your fault

69
00:05:31,272 --> 00:05:32,938
'cause you introduced
me to street food.

70
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,330
Yeah, that was when we were
young and in New Delhi.

71
00:05:35,331 --> 00:05:36,342
Where, it turns out,

72
00:05:36,343 --> 00:05:38,308
they're not known for
their health inspectors,

73
00:05:38,309 --> 00:05:39,824
and you ate everything off the carts.

74
00:05:39,825 --> 00:05:42,313
- Well, that was before.
- Before what?

75
00:05:42,314 --> 00:05:45,049
Before I had something to lose.

76
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,351
Hmm.

77
00:05:49,288 --> 00:05:51,322
You're never gonna
lose me, Hank Galliston,

78
00:05:51,323 --> 00:05:52,717
no matter how hard you try.

79
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,936
All right, then.

80
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,061
Let's go back and get six
more with everything.

81
00:05:56,062 --> 00:05:58,263
Come on. We got shopping to do.

82
00:05:58,264 --> 00:06:00,698
What is it today,
parts or pieces?

83
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:02,267
We're hunting for treasure.

84
00:06:02,268 --> 00:06:04,302
I mean, look at this.

85
00:06:04,303 --> 00:06:07,672
Imagine what's it's seen, the
hands it's passed through.

86
00:06:07,673 --> 00:06:09,407
Any way to find out who?

87
00:06:09,408 --> 00:06:12,277
Not really. I mean,
things just wind up here.

88
00:06:12,278 --> 00:06:14,079
You know, found in someone's
attic after they die

89
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,414
or picked up in a garage sale.

90
00:06:16,415 --> 00:06:19,250
Their stories lost to history...

91
00:06:19,251 --> 00:06:20,852
Really?

92
00:06:20,853 --> 00:06:22,687
Making fun of me now?

93
00:06:22,688 --> 00:06:24,355
No! I'm not making fun.

94
00:06:24,356 --> 00:06:26,692
I'm making fun with you,
'cause, like, we're a team.

95
00:06:26,693 --> 00:06:28,860
Oh, is that it?
Don't you have, like,

96
00:06:28,861 --> 00:06:30,376
a, you know, magazine to be putting out?

97
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,023
I should be getting back.

98
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,564
I have played hooky long enough.

99
00:06:35,367 --> 00:06:38,436
Well, I'm gonna be at the
shop later if you wanna...

100
00:06:38,437 --> 00:06:39,938
you know,

101
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:41,973
play a little somethin' else.

102
00:06:41,974 --> 00:06:43,241
It's a deal.

103
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:47,312
I love you.

104
00:06:47,313 --> 00:06:49,247
I love you,

105
00:06:49,248 --> 00:06:50,683
even with my hoof breath.

106
00:06:52,685 --> 00:06:54,218
See ya, honey!

107
00:07:26,685 --> 00:07:28,152
Hello!

108
00:07:28,153 --> 00:07:29,321
We're on deadline!

109
00:07:29,322 --> 00:07:31,689
Who has got a story to pitch?

110
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,159
Well, we've got a ton of news
feeds coming out of Romania

111
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,294
about a family of werewolves.

112
00:07:36,295 --> 00:07:38,262
Werewolves? Come on, guys.

113
00:07:38,263 --> 00:07:40,965
What do I tell every reporter
on their first day of work?

114
00:07:40,966 --> 00:07:42,301
Don't start with the headline.

115
00:07:42,302 --> 00:07:43,901
Start with the facts.

116
00:07:43,902 --> 00:07:45,302
Which is why we're starting
with these facts...

117
00:07:45,303 --> 00:07:46,739
That there are people with

118
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,873
a really inappropriate
amount of body hair.

119
00:07:48,874 --> 00:07:50,108
Mm-hmm.

120
00:07:50,109 --> 00:07:51,808
They're also the symptoms
of hypertrichosis,

121
00:07:51,809 --> 00:07:52,978
a congenital condition

122
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:55,313
that causes uncontrollable
hair growth.

123
00:07:55,314 --> 00:07:57,216
It's the same thing
that brought us...

124
00:07:57,217 --> 00:07:59,417
Julia Pastrana,

125
00:07:59,418 --> 00:08:01,119
the "Werewolf woman."

126
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,254
Been doing this a long time,

127
00:08:02,255 --> 00:08:03,921
and one of the
things I've learned

128
00:08:03,922 --> 00:08:07,659
is that the first answer
might not be the right one.

129
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,261
But it could be the answer
to selling more magazines.

130
00:08:10,262 --> 00:08:12,164
People dig a little
mystery, Hank...

131
00:08:12,165 --> 00:08:14,298
a tease, an intellectual
reach-around...

132
00:08:14,299 --> 00:08:17,969
Things like spontaneous
combustion in Budapest.

133
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,338
Or... Or skunk apes in Arkansas.

134
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:22,141
I swear, you put one of
these on the cover...

135
00:08:22,142 --> 00:08:23,641
No, you know what?

136
00:08:23,642 --> 00:08:26,644
I am not gonna pay for you to
go skunk aping in Arkansas.

137
00:08:26,645 --> 00:08:27,946
Well, it's really not
as dirty as it sounds.

138
00:08:27,947 --> 00:08:29,681
And the point is, if you send us,

139
00:08:29,682 --> 00:08:31,148
you get to chill at home
with Laila for the weekend.

140
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:33,185
Yeah, and we'll stay in one
room to keep costs down.

141
00:08:33,186 --> 00:08:34,218
No, we won't.

142
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:35,721
What would make
Laila and I happiest

143
00:08:35,722 --> 00:08:38,222
is knowing that our favorite
reporters are safe,

144
00:08:38,223 --> 00:08:40,725
typing in their laptops,
in Brooklyn.

145
00:08:40,726 --> 00:08:43,761
Right, because tothing dangerous
ever happens in Brooklyn.

146
00:08:43,762 --> 00:08:45,096
The answer's still "No."

147
00:08:45,097 --> 00:08:47,965
Okay, fine, but, you know, when The Post
scoops up this whole skunk ape story,

148
00:08:47,966 --> 00:08:51,035
- just remember who was there
at the beginning. - Okay.

149
00:09:00,602 --> 00:09:01,905
Hey there.

150
00:09:01,947 --> 00:09:04,916
Shh! There's somebody
in the shop.

151
00:09:04,917 --> 00:09:06,051
What are you talking about?

152
00:09:09,188 --> 00:09:11,089
Laila?

153
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,191
- They're trying to get in.
- Hold on. Talk to me.

154
00:09:13,192 --> 00:09:15,127
Call the police.
Honey, call the police!

155
00:09:15,128 --> 00:09:16,983
Hey, Arron, call the
police. Don't ask.

156
00:09:16,984 --> 00:09:18,917
Just get 'em to Laila's shop now!

157
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,738
Okay, listen, I'm on
my way. Okay?

158
00:09:20,738 --> 00:09:21,595
You hear me?

159
00:09:22,101 --> 00:09:23,202
They're breaking in.

160
00:09:23,203 --> 00:09:25,270
Laila, what's going on?

161
00:09:25,271 --> 00:09:27,638
I've gotta fight 'em. There's
nothing else I can do.

162
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:29,409
No, no, do not fight them! Okay?
I'll be there in two minutes.

163
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,542
Laila?

164
00:09:30,543 --> 00:09:32,177
Aah! Laila!

165
00:09:36,349 --> 00:09:37,649
Laila?

166
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:40,552
Laila!

168
00:10:06,144 --> 00:10:08,312
How'd you get in?

169
00:10:08,313 --> 00:10:10,582
Call the police. Honey,
call the police! Aah!

170
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,881
All right, Mr. Galliston,
we have your statement.

171
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:17,192
When a D.I.C. gets assigned to
the case, you'll get a call.

172
00:10:17,193 --> 00:10:20,062
Wait, wait. You're telling me we're
still waiting on a detective?

173
00:10:20,063 --> 00:10:21,863
We're doing everything we can.

174
00:10:21,864 --> 00:10:23,196
You just asked me
seven generic questions

175
00:10:23,197 --> 00:10:24,898
and took pictures on an
8-year-old cell phone.

176
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:26,035
That's everything that you can?

177
00:10:26,036 --> 00:10:28,069
- Sir.
- I-I'm sorry,

178
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,104
but it just doesn't add up.

179
00:10:30,105 --> 00:10:31,739
I mean, if they
wanted easy money,

180
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,707
there's a liquor store
right down the street.

181
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:36,011
Big money... There... There's
an art dealer next door.

182
00:10:36,012 --> 00:10:38,846
Laila repaired old timepieces,

183
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:41,883
which, as far as I can tell,
none of them are missing.

184
00:10:41,884 --> 00:10:45,853
In fact, the only thing that is
missing right now is my wife!

185
00:11:02,504 --> 00:11:04,973
No. It's all right. It's okay.

186
00:11:06,141 --> 00:11:07,942
We're gonna find her, Hank.

187
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:15,983
Laila would've taken the train
back from the Flea Market

188
00:11:15,984 --> 00:11:16,952
to the shop, right?

189
00:11:16,953 --> 00:11:19,854
Yeah. She... She hates taxis.

190
00:11:19,855 --> 00:11:21,556
She's always saying it's cheating.

191
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:23,857
Okay, so it probably would've
been the "L" or the "G," right?

192
00:11:23,858 --> 00:11:25,659
You know, they've got
surveillance cameras

193
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,795
at almost every station now.

194
00:11:26,796 --> 00:11:30,098
Maybe whoever did
this was following her.

195
00:11:32,396 --> 00:11:33,437
Hank?

196
00:11:33,438 --> 00:11:35,395
Sorry.

197
00:11:35,396 --> 00:11:37,931
Just, we keep asking "how."

198
00:11:37,932 --> 00:11:40,686
If we want answers,
we have to ask "Why."

199
00:11:40,687 --> 00:11:41,936
W-Why her?

200
00:11:41,937 --> 00:11:43,138
Why the shop?

201
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:44,873
"Why" will drive
you crazy, Hank.

202
00:11:53,482 --> 00:11:56,985
She must've come home before
she went to the shop.

203
00:12:01,691 --> 00:12:03,492
Sorry to come by so
late, Mr. Galliston.

204
00:12:03,493 --> 00:12:06,161
We're here to discuss the
incident on Bedford Avenue.

205
00:12:06,162 --> 00:12:07,495
FBI?

206
00:12:07,496 --> 00:12:09,030
We would've called
first, but we...

207
00:12:09,031 --> 00:12:11,733
No, no, no. It... It's fine.
Please, come in.

208
00:12:13,803 --> 00:12:17,939
No, I grabbed these because
I figured the could help.

209
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,009
I just felt like I had to...
Had to do something.

210
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,644
Well, it looks like

211
00:12:22,645 --> 00:12:24,046
you guys were doing a
whole lot of "something."

212
00:12:24,047 --> 00:12:26,047
Oh, this is where you
tell us to back off,

213
00:12:26,048 --> 00:12:27,582
let you do your job?

214
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,016
No, no, no. This is where
I say, "I get it."

215
00:12:29,017 --> 00:12:30,584
When you lose someone
that you love,

216
00:12:30,585 --> 00:12:31,854
the hardest thing
is to do nothing.

217
00:12:31,855 --> 00:12:34,689
May I?

218
00:12:35,925 --> 00:12:38,026
Police have any new leads?

219
00:12:38,027 --> 00:12:39,728
Not as many as we do.

220
00:12:39,729 --> 00:12:41,062
I don't understand.

221
00:12:41,063 --> 00:12:43,466
We don't know much about
your wife, Mr. Galliston,

222
00:12:43,467 --> 00:12:45,967
but we know quite a bit
about who might have her.

223
00:12:45,968 --> 00:12:48,203
You see, we've been
working on this case

224
00:12:48,204 --> 00:12:50,171
for a very, very long time.

225
00:12:53,042 --> 00:12:54,876
This was taken

226
00:12:54,877 --> 00:12:57,146
from the traffic camera across
the street from the shop.

227
00:12:57,147 --> 00:12:59,547
Is that him?

228
00:13:07,623 --> 00:13:09,924
Oh, God.

229
00:13:11,494 --> 00:13:13,528
Laila.

230
00:13:21,003 --> 00:13:22,637
Who is he?

231
00:13:22,638 --> 00:13:24,973
Name "White Vincent"
mean anything to you?

232
00:13:24,974 --> 00:13:26,508
No.

233
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:28,210
He started out as
French Foreign Legion,

234
00:13:28,211 --> 00:13:30,612
ended up the highest-end
mercenary in the world.

235
00:13:30,613 --> 00:13:32,479
He's on every no-fly
list that we've got.

236
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,716
The fact that he's
operating on U.S. soil

237
00:13:33,717 --> 00:13:35,683
is obviously a problem.

238
00:13:35,684 --> 00:13:38,186
What would a guy like that
be doing taking my wife?

239
00:13:38,187 --> 00:13:40,755
Actually, that was gonna
be my question to you.

240
00:13:40,756 --> 00:13:41,922
W-What do you mean?

241
00:13:41,923 --> 00:13:43,090
Well, there's only so
much we can tell

242
00:13:43,091 --> 00:13:44,460
from credit card receipts,
travel records,

243
00:13:44,461 --> 00:13:46,561
- about a woman, and so I...
- A woman?

244
00:13:46,562 --> 00:13:47,763
You... You're talking
about Laila?

245
00:13:47,764 --> 00:13:49,898
She's the victim here.

246
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:51,200
Well, that's certainly
how it would appear,

247
00:13:51,201 --> 00:13:53,735
but part of my job is to
look beyond appearances.

248
00:13:53,736 --> 00:13:56,237
I believe you do the same
thing at your magazine.

249
00:13:56,238 --> 00:13:58,238
So we were wondering if you
had any other information

250
00:13:58,239 --> 00:14:00,109
that might help us conduct
our investigation.

251
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,876
Investigating who?

252
00:14:01,877 --> 00:14:03,578
My wife is not a terrorist.

253
00:14:03,579 --> 00:14:04,879
She owns a clock shop.

254
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,046
And yet she's been kidnapped

255
00:14:06,047 --> 00:14:07,714
by one of the world's
most dangerous men.

256
00:14:07,715 --> 00:14:08,884
You don't find that odd?

257
00:14:10,186 --> 00:14:12,587
You know, you had me
when you came in here

258
00:14:12,588 --> 00:14:14,123
with your "fed with a
heart of gold" thing.

259
00:14:14,124 --> 00:14:15,557
That was a nice touch.

260
00:14:15,558 --> 00:14:17,158
She means something to him.

261
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:19,160
I need to know what
that something is.

262
00:14:19,161 --> 00:14:21,696
We can help each
other find Vincent.

263
00:14:21,697 --> 00:14:23,832
We want the same thing.

264
00:14:25,201 --> 00:14:29,470
Unless you have something
more for me,

265
00:14:29,471 --> 00:14:31,673
I gave the police
my full statement.

266
00:14:31,674 --> 00:14:34,042
You can get it from them.

267
00:14:37,112 --> 00:14:38,480
I think you know what to do

268
00:14:38,481 --> 00:14:40,748
should anything additional
occur to you.

269
00:14:42,785 --> 00:14:44,118
Hmm.

270
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,500
Hank, are you okay?

271
00:14:59,501 --> 00:15:02,670
Laila Must've bought this today.

272
00:15:04,773 --> 00:15:06,207
What are you doing?

273
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,576
Guy was looking for something.

274
00:15:08,577 --> 00:15:10,612
Typical movement.

275
00:15:10,613 --> 00:15:12,080
Bushings.

276
00:15:12,081 --> 00:15:15,149
Clicks. Gong wire.

277
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:19,150
You're with somebody long
enough, you soak stuff up.

278
00:15:21,156 --> 00:15:23,791
Escapement.

279
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:25,693
Regulator.

280
00:15:25,694 --> 00:15:28,129
Quartz.

281
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,731
Quartz isn't right.

282
00:15:31,567 --> 00:15:33,568
Hey, what's that?

283
00:15:38,674 --> 00:15:39,807
A diamond.

284
00:15:39,808 --> 00:15:43,578
And suddenly, we have a motive.

285
00:15:43,579 --> 00:15:45,146
Pretty tiny motive.

286
00:15:48,751 --> 00:15:50,451
And a...

287
00:15:50,452 --> 00:15:51,853
flawed one at that.

288
00:15:55,624 --> 00:15:57,992
Um, Hank?

289
00:15:59,695 --> 00:16:01,095
If that's not a motive,

290
00:16:01,096 --> 00:16:03,665
then... maybe this is.

291
00:16:06,802 --> 00:16:08,636
What?

292
00:16:08,637 --> 00:16:11,739
And if I'm not mistaken,

293
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,775
that right there is
a treasure map.

294
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:30,309
I'm telling you, that is
definitely a treasure map.

295
00:16:30,344 --> 00:16:32,186
It's not a treasure map.
Treasure maps don't exist.

296
00:16:32,187 --> 00:16:34,556
They were invented
by Robert Louis Stevenson,

297
00:16:34,557 --> 00:16:37,659
and then the myth was cemented
by "B" Hollywood movies.

298
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,861
Uh, "Goonies" was
not a "B" movie.

299
00:16:39,862 --> 00:16:40,963
Well, then what else
would it be then?

300
00:16:40,964 --> 00:16:43,665
Okay.

301
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm gonna say... near Eastern.

302
00:16:46,001 --> 00:16:48,036
Old. Mm-hmm.

303
00:16:48,037 --> 00:16:49,438
If we could read the
writing, which we can't,

304
00:16:49,439 --> 00:16:51,506
it would tell us what
this map leads to.

305
00:16:51,507 --> 00:16:53,608
Well, I think I know
where this is going.

306
00:16:53,609 --> 00:16:57,679
If you can't do something
yourself, find somebody who can.

307
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,081
The priest.

308
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:10,191
You have any idea what
you've got here?

309
00:17:10,192 --> 00:17:12,560
The language is...

310
00:17:12,561 --> 00:17:14,929
a dead strain of Demonic,

311
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:17,598
reserved only for
the priestly elite.

312
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:21,069
But it doesn't fit 'cause
that language died

313
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,904
in the 2nd Century.

314
00:17:22,905 --> 00:17:24,172
2nd Century?

315
00:17:24,173 --> 00:17:26,674
We're looking at a map of
the Western hemisphere.

316
00:17:26,675 --> 00:17:28,077
They didn't know about
the Western hemisphere

317
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:30,044
in the 2nd Century.

318
00:17:30,045 --> 00:17:33,081
Meaning, some wing of the Church
has secretly been using it

319
00:17:33,082 --> 00:17:35,483
for 2,000 years.

320
00:17:35,484 --> 00:17:38,753
We're rewriting history
books here, Hank.

321
00:17:38,754 --> 00:17:41,456
But it doesn't explain Vincent.

322
00:17:41,457 --> 00:17:44,125
I mean, why would a mercenary
like that want this?

323
00:17:44,126 --> 00:17:45,127
'Cause it's a treasure map?

324
00:17:45,128 --> 00:17:47,161
Doubt it.

325
00:17:47,162 --> 00:17:50,865
The Rosicruicians weren't
the materialist sort.

326
00:17:50,866 --> 00:17:52,166
Rosicruicians?

327
00:17:52,167 --> 00:17:56,137
A secret society of
Christian mystics.

328
00:17:56,138 --> 00:17:58,873
They're still in existence,
hidden throughout society,

329
00:17:58,874 --> 00:18:01,109
readying themselves
for the Apocalypse.

330
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:03,678
Father, that spot on the map...

331
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,447
if it's not treasure,
then what is it?

332
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,550
"New Bartholomew."

333
00:18:09,551 --> 00:18:10,918
A city?

334
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:12,987
A city? Not... Not with
these coordinates.

335
00:18:12,988 --> 00:18:14,622
This is in the Arctic Circle.

336
00:18:17,926 --> 00:18:19,093
Hello?

337
00:18:19,094 --> 00:18:21,162
She says you have the clock.

338
00:18:21,163 --> 00:18:23,998
Please, just tell me.
Is she okay?

339
00:18:23,999 --> 00:18:26,034
Do you know, Henry
David Galliston,

340
00:18:26,035 --> 00:18:27,702
that you lived before?

341
00:18:27,703 --> 00:18:30,471
You're just a shadow of the
past cast forward in time.

342
00:18:30,472 --> 00:18:32,573
Is she okay?

343
00:18:32,574 --> 00:18:35,410
Your name is no more "Henry"
than mine is... you know,

344
00:18:35,411 --> 00:18:37,110
whatever they're
calling me these days.

345
00:18:37,111 --> 00:18:38,981
I don't know what you're talking about.

346
00:18:38,982 --> 00:18:40,982
It's good that you don't, brother,

347
00:18:40,983 --> 00:18:44,886
because if you knew the real
truth, you'd lose your mind,

348
00:18:44,887 --> 00:18:47,088
as I've lost mine.

349
00:18:47,089 --> 00:18:49,057
Listen to me. Okay, uh...

350
00:18:49,058 --> 00:18:51,526
The, uh... I'll do you a solid.

351
00:18:51,527 --> 00:18:54,128
Okay, the FBI is onto
you in a big way.

352
00:18:54,129 --> 00:18:57,565
So why don't you just let her go?

353
00:18:57,566 --> 00:19:00,068
Okay? No... No...
No harm, no foul.

354
00:19:00,069 --> 00:19:02,770
Oh, there's plenty of harm here,

355
00:19:02,771 --> 00:19:04,505
plenty of foul.

356
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:09,444
What are you doing?

357
00:19:09,445 --> 00:19:10,678
No, no, no!

358
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:11,847
Don't hurt her!

359
00:19:11,848 --> 00:19:15,049
The clock comes to me on this day,

360
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:18,303
or she dies...

361
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,754
On this day.

362
00:19:20,956 --> 00:19:22,023
No!

363
00:19:22,024 --> 00:19:23,958
Yes! Yes!

364
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:26,427
Yes. Just... please don't hurt her.

365
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:31,165
The park, between Pine and 23rd.

366
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,601
Bring the clock at 4:00.

367
00:19:33,602 --> 00:19:35,169
And, Hank,

368
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:36,771
you've seen enough films

369
00:19:36,772 --> 00:19:39,108
to know not to get
the police involved.

370
00:19:44,513 --> 00:19:46,514
If I could still advise caution?

371
00:19:46,515 --> 00:19:50,017
Now what we have here is a
profound historical import.

372
00:19:50,018 --> 00:19:51,487
To yield it to a madman...

373
00:19:51,488 --> 00:19:53,521
We're talking about my wife here.

374
00:19:53,522 --> 00:19:55,156
This guy's a pro.

375
00:19:55,157 --> 00:19:57,425
We mess with him, she's dead.

376
00:19:57,426 --> 00:19:59,660
I've known you since grade school.

377
00:19:59,661 --> 00:20:01,063
I married the two of you.

378
00:20:01,064 --> 00:20:03,064
This is not easy for me to say.

379
00:20:03,065 --> 00:20:04,832
But if the guy's a pro,

380
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:08,903
you think he's gonna let
someone who can I.D. him go?

381
00:20:08,904 --> 00:20:10,471
Then what?

382
00:20:10,472 --> 00:20:11,640
We've got the one thing

383
00:20:11,641 --> 00:20:13,641
motivating him to keep her alive.

384
00:20:13,642 --> 00:20:17,445
We stop him before he
gets it, she might live.

385
00:20:17,446 --> 00:20:20,948
He wants the clock, we
bait him with the clock,

386
00:20:20,949 --> 00:20:23,784
but we hold on to the diamond.

387
00:20:28,841 --> 00:20:29,859
What's he's asking?

388
00:20:29,894 --> 00:20:30,992
Cash. Lots of it.

389
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:33,570
Vincent's got swimming
pools full of cash.

390
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,485
Maybe he wants another one.

391
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,202
Why does it always feel like
I'm playing poker with you,

392
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:38,286
Mr. Galliston?

393
00:20:38,221 --> 00:20:39,981
It would be so much easier if
you just tell me the truth.

394
00:20:39,982 --> 00:20:41,472
I am telling you the truth.

395
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:42,236
Of course.

396
00:20:42,237 --> 00:20:43,304
Tell you what.

397
00:20:43,305 --> 00:20:44,171
As long as your info gets us Vincent,

398
00:20:44,172 --> 00:20:45,874
I'm gonna pretend like I
actually believe you.

399
00:20:47,976 --> 00:20:49,477
This is your rendezvous spot,

400
00:20:49,478 --> 00:20:51,113
which we're pretty certain
he'll be nowhere near.

401
00:20:51,114 --> 00:20:53,514
Good choice... Half a dozen
30-story buildings

402
00:20:53,515 --> 00:20:54,982
with direct sight lines.

403
00:20:54,983 --> 00:20:56,449
A couple of hundred
windows per building,

404
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:58,885
and suddenly he's in any
one of a thousand places,

405
00:20:58,886 --> 00:21:00,820
waiting to see if you've
engaged law enforcement.

406
00:21:00,821 --> 00:21:02,923
When he sees that you're
alone... And you will be...

407
00:21:02,924 --> 00:21:04,126
Your phone will ring,

408
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:06,928
and he will give you the
real rendezvous spot.

409
00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:09,797
We will be sitting on that call,
we will locate him from it,

410
00:21:09,798 --> 00:21:11,432
and we will bring him down.

411
00:21:11,433 --> 00:21:14,402
My wife comes first. I
wanna be clear about that.

412
00:21:14,403 --> 00:21:16,037
I can't promise you that.

413
00:21:16,038 --> 00:21:18,973
I can promise that
we'll do our best.

414
00:21:18,974 --> 00:21:21,609
I can also promise you that
this will be your best

415
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:24,979
and maybe only chance of
getting your wife back alive.

416
00:21:33,121 --> 00:21:34,822
I want you to take it.

417
00:21:34,823 --> 00:21:35,991
No, I couldn't.

418
00:21:35,992 --> 00:21:37,491
Keep it locked in
the parish safe.

419
00:21:37,492 --> 00:21:40,428
Okay? I want it a million
miles away from the drop.

420
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:41,797
It's the only leverage we have.

421
00:21:43,932 --> 00:21:47,602
Anything hits the fan...
Anything... You call me.

422
00:21:47,603 --> 00:21:49,804
We're gonna get her back.

423
00:21:49,805 --> 00:21:52,139
All right?

424
00:22:15,262 --> 00:22:17,544
You don't have to scrub me.
I'm... I'm all alone.

425
00:22:17,798 --> 00:22:18,965
"Scrub" you?

426
00:22:18,966 --> 00:22:21,267
God bless you and your
Hollywood films.

427
00:22:21,268 --> 00:22:25,268
The monument 200 yards ahead
of you... Get there, please.

428
00:22:39,487 --> 00:22:41,688
Skype number. He's doing
it through the Internet

429
00:22:41,689 --> 00:22:43,524
so we can't track the cell's G.P.S.

430
00:22:43,525 --> 00:22:45,392
Smart but not genius.

431
00:22:45,393 --> 00:22:46,792
The Internet leaves a footprint.

432
00:22:46,793 --> 00:22:47,828
We go after the router.

433
00:22:47,829 --> 00:22:48,929
Exactly.

434
00:22:51,766 --> 00:22:53,667
158 Pine.

435
00:22:53,668 --> 00:22:55,936
We have a hit on the top floor.
I'm on my way.

436
00:22:55,937 --> 00:22:59,937
Blanket anything within
100 feet of that signal.

437
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:11,084
- Yeah?
- Good.

438
00:23:11,085 --> 00:23:13,987
One more stop, and the game
of red rover will be over.

439
00:23:13,988 --> 00:23:15,989
Come around to the
other side of the park.

440
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:19,459
There's a coffee shop
around the corner.

441
00:23:27,935 --> 00:23:30,604
That's right. Just like that.
Keep on coming.

442
00:23:30,605 --> 00:23:31,771
Sorry?

443
00:23:31,772 --> 00:23:34,441
Keep on walking.

444
00:23:35,676 --> 00:23:37,078
You mean like I-I am right now?

445
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:39,846
Yes. Just like you're
walking right now. Hurry.

446
00:23:41,816 --> 00:23:43,783
He can't see me.

447
00:23:43,784 --> 00:23:45,518
Something's off.

448
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:02,637
Clear.

449
00:24:02,638 --> 00:24:03,837
Clear!

450
00:24:27,795 --> 00:24:30,630
Where is she?!

451
00:24:30,631 --> 00:24:31,798
Where is she?

452
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:33,800
He was broadcasting to
somewhere else.

453
00:24:34,935 --> 00:24:37,470
He wanted to distract us...

454
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,575
Because what he
wanted wasn't here.

455
00:24:42,576 --> 00:24:43,577
He knew somehow.

456
00:24:50,418 --> 00:24:51,985
Mickle!

457
00:24:53,321 --> 00:24:54,521
No!

458
00:24:54,522 --> 00:24:57,490
Mickle?

459
00:24:57,491 --> 00:24:58,892
Hey.

460
00:25:03,764 --> 00:25:05,498
Help!

461
00:25:13,253 --> 00:25:15,690
You're gonna be okay. You're gonna
make it. You hear me?

462
00:25:24,704 --> 00:25:25,872
What are they saying?

463
00:25:25,873 --> 00:25:27,673
They're saying it's not good.

464
00:25:27,674 --> 00:25:29,608
Mr. Galliston!

465
00:25:29,609 --> 00:25:31,810
Unh-Unh. We are done.

466
00:25:31,811 --> 00:25:32,915
I told you it wasn't certain.

467
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,716
You told me you could put a trace on him,

468
00:25:34,717 --> 00:25:36,451
and now he's in the wind.

469
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:37,686
He... He got what he wanted.

470
00:25:37,687 --> 00:25:40,922
- And what exactly is that?
- Don't start with me.

471
00:25:40,923 --> 00:25:43,024
Poker time is done. We
checked your bank account.

472
00:25:43,025 --> 00:25:45,092
Financially, you are
a dust mite to him.

473
00:25:45,093 --> 00:25:46,562
This was never about money.

474
00:25:46,563 --> 00:25:48,529
You wanna arrest me? Arrest me.

475
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:49,932
But what you should
be doing right now

476
00:25:49,933 --> 00:25:52,934
is looking for a killer... One
who, at this very moment,

477
00:25:52,935 --> 00:25:55,770
is probably putting a
bullet into my wife's head.

478
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:12,487
Don't believe that.

479
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:14,522
Don't believe what you just said.

480
00:26:14,523 --> 00:26:17,058
He doesn't need us
anymore, Rachel.

481
00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:19,827
He got what he wanted.
He doesn't need Laila.

482
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,629
- Hank...
- It's logic.

483
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:24,499
A guy like that, he
eliminates loose ends.

484
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,000
Well, then screw logic, Hank.

485
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,401
Logic is the compass...

486
00:26:27,402 --> 00:26:28,403
That as of right now

487
00:26:28,404 --> 00:26:31,172
will get you exactly nowhere.

488
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:33,107
He's right.

489
00:26:33,108 --> 00:26:35,710
Now it's all about believing.
You've just gotta believe.

490
00:26:37,145 --> 00:26:40,147
After all this, she wants
me to have faith.

491
00:26:40,148 --> 00:26:41,749
Yes.

492
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,451
You've got two ways you can go.

493
00:26:43,452 --> 00:26:45,420
You can believe she's
dead and quit,

494
00:26:45,421 --> 00:26:48,489
or you can believe she's
alive and find her.

495
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:51,459
Even if I have faith,

496
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,761
it's not gonna
create any options,

497
00:26:52,762 --> 00:26:56,430
which we have absolutely
none right now.

498
00:26:56,431 --> 00:26:58,933
That's not true.

499
00:26:58,934 --> 00:27:01,469
Okay.

500
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:02,469
Think about it.

501
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:03,837
There's only one place left

502
00:27:03,838 --> 00:27:05,741
that we could possibly
find him and Laila...

503
00:27:05,742 --> 00:27:08,910
New Bartholomew,

504
00:27:08,911 --> 00:27:10,511
whatever the hell that is.

505
00:27:17,019 --> 00:27:18,452
I'm in.

506
00:27:18,453 --> 00:27:19,419
Arrange travel.

507
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,554
With pleasure.

508
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:21,823
For me and me only.

509
00:27:21,824 --> 00:27:23,157
- Whoa. Whoa. What?
- Wait.

510
00:27:23,158 --> 00:27:24,526
You are better served investigating

511
00:27:24,527 --> 00:27:25,993
who made the clock.

512
00:27:25,994 --> 00:27:28,930
Where that thing came from
may answer the "Why,"

513
00:27:28,931 --> 00:27:32,400
because If for whatever reason I
come back here without Laila,

514
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:33,600
I'll need another lead

515
00:27:33,601 --> 00:27:35,037
and another lead
and another lead

516
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:37,171
until we find her. Got it?

517
00:27:37,172 --> 00:27:39,006
Yeah.

518
00:27:39,007 --> 00:27:41,542
Oh, and everything happens
in this office...

519
00:27:41,543 --> 00:27:44,111
On the phones, online.

520
00:27:44,112 --> 00:27:46,180
No flights. Not even a text.

521
00:27:46,181 --> 00:27:48,449
I'm telling you, it's a
mistake not to bring us.

522
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:52,153
It's a bigger mistake
to get you hurt.

523
00:27:52,154 --> 00:27:53,956
I've had enough collateral
damage on this one

524
00:27:53,957 --> 00:27:57,458
to last a lifetime.

525
00:28:03,031 --> 00:28:04,533
Flight gets you into
Whitefish, and then you've got

526
00:28:04,534 --> 00:28:06,534
a 200-Mile drive across
the tundra after that,

527
00:28:06,535 --> 00:28:07,968
where you can hire
a pontoon plane

528
00:28:07,969 --> 00:28:09,436
to fly you the rest of the way.

529
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:11,073
If you leave now, you can
just make your flight.

530
00:28:11,074 --> 00:28:12,573
Thank you.

531
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:25,586
Good luck.

532
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,001
Huh. Figured I wasn't done with you.

533
00:28:40,002 --> 00:28:41,502
We're just finding it very curious

534
00:28:41,503 --> 00:28:43,739
why a man who's in the
throes of an abduction case

535
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,506
is flying off to Canada.

536
00:28:45,507 --> 00:28:47,108
What's in Canada, Mr. Galliston?

537
00:28:47,109 --> 00:28:49,944
Bunch of ice, lots of beer,
reindeer. There's...

538
00:28:49,945 --> 00:28:51,411
Hey, quit being pigheaded!

539
00:28:51,412 --> 00:28:53,081
I'm with the FBI. I could
be a resource to you.

540
00:28:53,082 --> 00:28:55,116
I don't trust you, lady.

541
00:28:55,117 --> 00:28:57,084
Feeling's reciprocal.

542
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:05,427
Tell me what you
see, Mr. Galliston.

543
00:29:05,428 --> 00:29:07,595
A Fed looking for glory,

544
00:29:07,596 --> 00:29:09,998
trying to bring down number
one on the Watch List.

545
00:29:11,466 --> 00:29:14,435
Maybe you see a
social counselor...

546
00:29:14,436 --> 00:29:16,770
An ex-social counselor that
would like nothing better

547
00:29:16,771 --> 00:29:18,740
than to be a social
counselor again.

548
00:29:18,741 --> 00:29:21,442
Maybe you see a widow.

549
00:29:21,443 --> 00:29:23,477
Russiyana 71 mean
anything to you?

550
00:29:23,478 --> 00:29:24,745
No.

551
00:29:24,746 --> 00:29:27,114
It was a flight that went
down outside of Moscow

552
00:29:27,115 --> 00:29:28,183
four years ago.

553
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:31,018
All 270 people onboard died.

554
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,154
They blamed it on
Chechen separatists.

555
00:29:33,155 --> 00:29:35,022
Guess who the bomb maker was.

556
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,824
Vincent.

557
00:29:36,825 --> 00:29:39,126
My husband was on that flight.

558
00:29:39,127 --> 00:29:40,961
Condolences,

559
00:29:40,962 --> 00:29:42,663
and I mean that,

560
00:29:42,664 --> 00:29:44,066
but you're making a
massive assumption

561
00:29:44,067 --> 00:29:46,901
about you and I being
the same. We are not.

562
00:29:46,902 --> 00:29:49,003
My wife is not dead.

563
00:29:49,004 --> 00:29:50,705
Change of heart?

564
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:51,871
Let's just say that

565
00:29:51,872 --> 00:29:53,709
the alternative is no
longer an option.

566
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:57,011
Then you of all people
should know what it's like

567
00:29:57,012 --> 00:29:58,646
to have your heart ripped out

568
00:29:58,647 --> 00:30:00,048
and to listen to bureaucrats
tell you that

569
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:02,883
they're trying... Really
trying... and all the while,

570
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:06,420
that thing is out there
that did you injustice,

571
00:30:06,421 --> 00:30:08,122
and nothing is gonna happen

572
00:30:08,123 --> 00:30:09,957
unless you do something about it.

573
00:30:09,958 --> 00:30:11,126
You're going after Vincent.

574
00:30:11,127 --> 00:30:13,461
I know it, even if
I don't know how.

575
00:30:13,462 --> 00:30:15,096
He's lethal.

576
00:30:15,097 --> 00:30:18,099
I'm trained with a gun and I'm
licensed to travel with it.

577
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,935
That alone makes me
a resource to you.

578
00:30:20,936 --> 00:30:22,703
If I refuse?

579
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:27,108
Well, then you're just
gonna have to pretend

580
00:30:27,109 --> 00:30:30,778
that you don't see me
sitting across the aisle.

581
00:30:30,779 --> 00:30:33,114
Hey.

582
00:30:33,115 --> 00:30:35,616
Oh, right. Hey, come here. Check it out.

583
00:30:35,617 --> 00:30:37,118
Look at this.

584
00:30:38,687 --> 00:30:43,057
"Norbert Peter Steinke IV."

585
00:30:43,058 --> 00:30:44,825
"Uhrmacher"? What's "Uhrmacher"?

586
00:30:44,826 --> 00:30:46,761
"Clockmaker."

587
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:48,027
So you got a guy's name?

588
00:30:48,028 --> 00:30:49,765
No, I got a guy.

589
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:51,499
How many Norbert
Peter Steinke IV's

590
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,968
you think there
are in this world?

591
00:30:52,969 --> 00:30:54,101
Exactly two.

592
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:56,003
We got one in Switzerland
who's 9,

593
00:30:56,004 --> 00:30:59,607
and one in Bavaria who's 93.

594
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:02,576
Guess which one's capable
of making a clock.

595
00:31:02,577 --> 00:31:04,612
So you got a phone number,
an e-mail? Come on!

596
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:06,046
No, I got an address.

597
00:31:06,047 --> 00:31:07,648
The only way we get to this guy

598
00:31:07,649 --> 00:31:09,184
is if we do it the
old-fashioned way.

599
00:31:09,185 --> 00:31:11,752
Go knock on his door.

600
00:31:11,753 --> 00:31:14,021
No.

601
00:31:14,022 --> 00:31:17,922
You heard what he said. We stay
right here. There's no trip.

602
00:31:17,923 --> 00:31:20,324
That's adorable, but no.

603
00:31:23,828 --> 00:31:25,396
No.

604
00:31:25,397 --> 00:31:26,697
Taxi!

605
00:31:29,401 --> 00:31:30,568
J.F.K.

606
00:31:30,569 --> 00:31:32,570
He's gonna kill us.

607
00:31:59,197 --> 00:32:02,433
Clock goes round and
and round and round

608
00:32:02,434 --> 00:32:05,569
until one day...

609
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:08,472
It doesn't.

610
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,682
That day is tomorrow, dearie.

611
00:32:29,676 --> 00:32:30,841
Excuse me.

612
00:32:30,842 --> 00:32:32,176
Is that plane for hire?

613
00:32:32,177 --> 00:32:33,577
Yeah.

614
00:32:33,578 --> 00:32:35,680
Can I make it that far North?

615
00:32:35,681 --> 00:32:38,249
That's right on the circle.
Something special up there?

616
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,185
Well, that's what
we aim to find out.

617
00:32:40,186 --> 00:32:41,819
Will you fly us up there?

618
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,622
I'm bettin' you know the guy who
came through here yesterday,

619
00:32:43,623 --> 00:32:45,823
asking the exact same thing.

620
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:47,558
Did he have an accent?

621
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:49,695
That's him. Couldn't fly
him 'cause of the weather.

622
00:32:49,696 --> 00:32:52,697
Well, our friend... Did he
have a woman with him?

623
00:32:52,698 --> 00:32:53,865
Didn't see one.

624
00:32:53,866 --> 00:32:56,200
He coulda had one in the
four-by, I suppose.

625
00:32:56,201 --> 00:32:59,470
Impression I got, he was in
such a hurry, he couldn't wait.

626
00:32:59,471 --> 00:33:02,174
He was gonna drive up there if I couldn't
fly him, which, of course, is nuts.

627
00:33:02,175 --> 00:33:04,842
Take you a whole day, if the
tundra's even passable.

628
00:33:04,843 --> 00:33:06,243
Will you fly us?

629
00:33:06,244 --> 00:33:08,846
If your money's green,
my plane's got wings.

630
00:33:14,486 --> 00:33:16,520
Okay, hang a right up here.

631
00:33:31,269 --> 00:33:33,203
Hi. Are you Norbert
Peter Steinke IV?

632
00:33:33,204 --> 00:33:34,704
The one that made
clocks in the '30s?

633
00:33:34,705 --> 00:33:36,842
Wait, Wait, wait. Hey, we
came a long way to see you.

634
00:33:36,843 --> 00:33:38,042
I don't care.

635
00:33:38,043 --> 00:33:39,511
But we found one of your clocks.

636
00:33:39,512 --> 00:33:41,479
I've made plenty of clocks.

637
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,748
I think this is a special one.

638
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,920
Dear Lord.

639
00:33:56,528 --> 00:34:00,231
Are you sure these
are the coordinates?

640
00:34:00,232 --> 00:34:01,833
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.

641
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:40,871
What do you see?

642
00:34:40,872 --> 00:34:42,206
I don't know.

643
00:34:49,548 --> 00:34:53,548
I thought that clock
was lost to time,

644
00:34:54,486 --> 00:34:56,887
and yet you have
found one of them.

645
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:00,491
You're a Rosicruician.

646
00:35:00,492 --> 00:35:04,492
These are matters you don't
want to be involved with.

647
00:35:05,964 --> 00:35:08,499
Trust me.

648
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,068
We're not leaving until
you give us some answers.

649
00:35:11,069 --> 00:35:14,772
Has blood been spilled?

650
00:35:14,773 --> 00:35:17,074
Yeah.

651
00:35:17,075 --> 00:35:20,244
Then it is just as it was.

652
00:35:20,245 --> 00:35:23,647
They are looking for
the clocks again.

653
00:35:23,648 --> 00:35:26,517
Willing, again, to kill.

654
00:35:26,518 --> 00:35:29,153
Clocks? As in multiples?

655
00:35:29,154 --> 00:35:32,156
Talk to us. We know about
the map inside the clock.

656
00:35:32,157 --> 00:35:35,226
Why did you make it? What...
What is new Bartholomew?

657
00:35:35,227 --> 00:35:37,495
Is it a city?

658
00:35:37,496 --> 00:35:41,496
New Bartholomew isn't
a place, you fool.

659
00:35:50,175 --> 00:35:53,744
What would Vincent
think is out here?

660
00:35:53,745 --> 00:35:58,215
I think the only thing that
matters is that he's on his way.

661
00:35:58,216 --> 00:36:00,151
None of this makes any sense.

662
00:36:00,152 --> 00:36:04,522
According to him, it isn't
supposed to make any sense.

663
00:36:06,591 --> 00:36:09,093
He said I'd lose my mind.

664
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,049
New Bartholomew is...

665
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:33,684
Was...

666
00:36:33,685 --> 00:36:36,220
Was a man.

667
00:36:36,221 --> 00:36:39,056
You're telling me the map leads to a man?

668
00:36:39,057 --> 00:36:40,257
Who? Why?

669
00:36:40,258 --> 00:36:43,227
12 numbers on the clock.

670
00:36:43,228 --> 00:36:46,830
12 men to save the world.

671
00:36:46,831 --> 00:36:49,099
12 apostles.

672
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,769
12 apostles? What are
you talking about?

673
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:54,769
The men Christ entrusted with
the salvation of mankind.

674
00:36:56,107 --> 00:36:58,108
Yes, and that happened
2,000 years ago.

675
00:36:58,109 --> 00:36:59,243
No.

676
00:36:59,244 --> 00:37:03,047
It was in 1938.

677
00:37:34,846 --> 00:37:38,015
In 1938,

678
00:37:38,016 --> 00:37:41,852
Europe was in flames.

679
00:37:41,853 --> 00:37:46,557
The very future of the
world was in doubt.

680
00:37:46,558 --> 00:37:48,125
So the Church...

681
00:37:48,126 --> 00:37:52,529
We did something that
has never been done

682
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:56,233
in 2,000 years.

683
00:37:56,234 --> 00:38:00,234
We appointed 12 new apostles...

684
00:38:01,873 --> 00:38:04,141
A new Luke, a new Peter,

685
00:38:04,142 --> 00:38:07,044
a new Bartholomew.

686
00:38:07,045 --> 00:38:10,581
And they were given a secret...

687
00:38:10,582 --> 00:38:14,084
One that not even the Pope knew.

688
00:38:14,085 --> 00:38:18,085
A secret that could bring
about the end of the world.

689
00:38:38,476 --> 00:38:42,476
Executed. All of them.

690
00:38:44,616 --> 00:38:46,984
And if they ended up up here,

691
00:38:46,985 --> 00:38:49,653
they were way, way off course.

692
00:38:49,654 --> 00:38:53,654
No, they ended up exactly
where they wanted to be.

693
00:38:55,026 --> 00:38:59,129
The Apostles are scattered to
the four corners of the globe

694
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:03,130
to keep that secret as far away
from the Nazis as they could.

695
00:39:04,903 --> 00:39:08,903
One clock was made
for each apostle.

696
00:39:09,841 --> 00:39:13,841
I made the clock for
new Bartholomew.

697
00:39:15,113 --> 00:39:18,248
He was a holy man.

698
00:39:18,249 --> 00:39:21,185
He was a noble man.

699
00:39:21,186 --> 00:39:25,155
He was a Nazi officer.

700
00:39:39,003 --> 00:39:43,040
You said that he had a secret.
What... What was it?

701
00:39:43,041 --> 00:39:46,510
Only the 12 knew.

702
00:39:46,511 --> 00:39:50,511
It was something hidden
beneath the cathedral.

703
00:39:53,818 --> 00:39:56,987
But there were whispers

704
00:39:56,988 --> 00:40:00,524
that it was a secret the
Nazis could never know

705
00:40:00,525 --> 00:40:03,060
because the Nazis
had figured out

706
00:40:03,061 --> 00:40:05,596
the first steps to eternal life.

707
00:40:07,065 --> 00:40:08,632
They had a way

708
00:40:08,633 --> 00:40:12,633
to render God irrelevant.

709
00:40:26,985 --> 00:40:29,086
Do you know,
Henry David Galliston,

710
00:40:29,087 --> 00:40:32,189
that you lived before?

711
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:36,093
That you're just a shadow of
the past cast forward in time?

712
00:40:36,094 --> 00:40:38,829
The Nazis' reign ended,

713
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:42,065
but the experiments didn't.

714
00:40:42,066 --> 00:40:45,002
Neither did the
search for those clocks.

715
00:40:45,003 --> 00:40:47,805
You must find these clocks,

716
00:40:47,806 --> 00:40:50,073
and you must do this

717
00:40:50,074 --> 00:40:52,476
before the enemy does,

718
00:40:52,477 --> 00:40:56,477
because if those
clocks resurface

719
00:40:56,881 --> 00:40:59,883
and blood has been spilled,

720
00:40:59,884 --> 00:41:03,620
then a storm is coming.

721
00:41:03,621 --> 00:41:07,621
It will pit Science
against Religion,

722
00:41:07,792 --> 00:41:10,093
country against country.

723
00:41:10,094 --> 00:41:12,729
The whole world will be drawn up

724
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:14,531
into this storm.

725
00:41:14,532 --> 00:41:16,533
It will be unholy

726
00:41:16,534 --> 00:41:20,571
and like the world has
never, ever seen before.

727
00:41:21,706 --> 00:41:25,706
And that storm is called...

728
00:41:27,479 --> 00:41:29,514
Zero Hour.

729
00:41:36,155 --> 00:41:41,158
