WHY HAVEN'T YOU TOLD ME
WHAT'S GOING ON?

1035

I DON'T... THAT'S WHY YOU
HAVEN'T SEEN ME.

1037

YOU CAN... BE OFF THE STREET,

1063
00:59:09,456 --> 00:59:11,192
AND YOU CAN SAVE
FOR AN APARTMENT,

1064
00:59:11,227 --> 00:59:14,162

AND JUST TAKE ANYTHING.

YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN
TELLING HER WE'VE BEEN CAMPING,

1074

SO SHE THINKS
WE'VE BEEN CAMPING,
