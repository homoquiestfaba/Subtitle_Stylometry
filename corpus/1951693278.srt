1
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:12,552
He's got a meeting
with his lawyer tomorrow.

2
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,889
Make a human being out of him.

3
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,417
Can you see me?

4
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:47,357
Stand up and move towards
the sound of my voice.

5
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:52,261
Get up and move towards
the sound of my voice.

6
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:54,433
OK.

7
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:28,326
Get up. We're going
to the showers now.

8
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,988
Put your right hand
through these bars.

9
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:56,988
Stick your other hand through.

10
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:13,571
Step out to the left.
Face the wall.

11
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:29,551
OK. To your left.

12
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,153
Let's go.

13
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:34,229
Move.

14
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,363
Go on.

15
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,307
Step out towards me.

16
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,347
To your right. Face the wall.

17
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:54,343
This way.

18
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:12,669
Turn and face the wall.

19
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,870
Need a towel,
medium jumpsuit...

20
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,672
size nine shoes.

21
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:28,511
This way.

22
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:02,984
Hey, man, you know
how to put your shoes on.

23
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:06,149
I helped you
with your jumpsuit.

24
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:09,820
I'll be damned if I'm putting
your shoes on for you.

25
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,541
Go on.

26
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:28,536
Put your foot in.

27
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,694
Stand up.

28
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:47,529
Turn to your left.

29
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,736
Let's go.

30
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,678
Finish this?

31
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,519
I'm Officer Whitmore.

32
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:15,257
Gonna have to take you
back to your cell.

33
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,852
Face the fence.

34
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:27,067
All right. Let's go.

35
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,475
Face that wall right there.

36
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:32,568
You're jerking him
right into shape, Fred.

37
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,078
He giving you any trouble?

38
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:35,408
No, Lieutenant.

39
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:38,575
Why don't you come over
for dinner one of these nights?

40
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:40,881
Bring the family.
Just give me a date.

41
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:43,547
Right. I'll talk to my wife.
Thank you.

42
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:44,817
That way.

43
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,259
He's an old friend of yours?

44
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:51,160
Yeah. Everybody knows Denver.

45
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,824
We do things my way on this tier.

46
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,165
Some of our clientele
just don't get it.

47
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:58,863
Have to protect my people.

48
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:00,872
Yeah, well, he seems
harmless enough.

49
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,134
Is that right?

50
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,109
Last year,
he killed one of my officers.

51
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:10,782
Face the wall.

52
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,678
You been down to L.J.'s yet?

53
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,341
No. What's that? Bar?

54
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,579
Yeah. Old correctional officer owns it.

55
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:50,918
Show him your I.D.,
he'll give you a free beer.

56
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,389
Face your cell.

57
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:53,686
Open 107!

58
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:58,096
Gonna play your juice card
tomorrow, Denver?

59
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,689
Tell your lawyer
I let you off the row...

60
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,701
let you see the sights
for a couple weeks?

61
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,532
Move. Inside the cell.

62
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,129
Close 107!

63
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:12,108
Don't even think
about dropping a note on me.

64
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:15,079
You do, and I'll slap
a 10-13 on you so fast...

65
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:17,843
you'll be eating prison scrip
for dinner. You got that?

66
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:22,844
They never got nothing to say
when you're strong with 'em.

67
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:24,890
Fuck you.

68
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:36,562
Come on, Fred.

69
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,679
Darrel, couldn't you
have opened that door...

70
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,012
about five seconds earlier?

71
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:29,020
Boy, I swear you got
no sense of timing.

72
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:38,758
This is heavy, mom.

73
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:42,096
Heh. Well, they had us work
through lunch hour today.

74
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:43,760
Well, I got some time and a half.

75
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:50,835
Darrel. Honey, what's this?

76
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,845
I was goalie today,
got hit by the ball.

77
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:55,505
Darrel, were you fighting again?

78
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:57,344
No. I was just blocking a shot.

79
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,543
- Darrel.
- It's the truth, mom.

80
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,119
Dad's home.

81
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:07,523
Dad's home.

82
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,296
Hi, dad.

83
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:16,664
How you doing, Darrel?

84
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,603
Jerry Coombs called me out today.

85
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,003
Oh, yeah?

86
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,506
I kicked his butt.

87
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,907
He only landed one shot.

88
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:28,279
Yeah. Well, you gotta learn to...

89
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,144
dodge them punches, son.

90
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:34,214
Let's go.

91
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,050
Mom inside?

92
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,090
Yeah.

93
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:51,336
I said we're ready to eat.

94
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:55,363
How'd it go today?

95
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,430
All right.

96
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,101
You sure?

97
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:01,169
Yeah. Lieutenant's pleased
with my work. I'm doing OK.

98
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:02,942
Great.

99
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:15,822
Darrel, I'm not telling you
one more time.

100
00:13:15,857 --> 00:13:17,452
Darrel, I'm not telling you
one more time.

101
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,497
Go to sleep.

102
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:50,686
Still working on that thing?

103
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,025
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Heh.

104
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:54,691
Carburetor in your car's
nothing like this one.

105
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,701
It's got a computer chip in it...

106
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,033
so you gotta be working on this.

107
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:01,971
Runs like it's got
a potato chip in it.

108
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:06,101
You know, we got time
to make plans, Fred.

109
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,112
Yeah, I know.

110
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,341
I know that.

111
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,247
Well, then, what is it?

112
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:13,910
Tell me.

113
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:20,287
You know,
I got a look today at a guy...

114
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,190
wasn't a man no more.

115
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:25,327
What do you mean?

116
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:32,103
I pulled him out of this place
they call the hole.

117
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:37,575
They stripped him naked.

118
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:41,079
They put him in a four-by-ten cell.

119
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:44,445
They closed an iron door
over the bars...

120
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:46,313
so that it was pitch-black.

121
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:50,481
And they left him there
for five weeks.

122
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:55,153
Five weeks.

123
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:58,025
Nothing inside except for him...

124
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:01,066
and a hole in the center
of the floor.

125
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:03,795
It was like a... a giant toilet.

126
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:09,839
So when I pulled him out...

127
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,036
he smelled like death warmed over...

128
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,807
smelled like shit,
looked like shit...

129
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,245
couldn't even talk.

130
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:22,946
Ah, the son of a bitch has earned
everything they give him.

131
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:25,616
He's a fucking killer,
and he fucking deserves to die.

132
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:46,943
Something else yesterday, huh?

133
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:48,945
Yes, sir.

134
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:51,175
I bet you never saw
anything like that...

135
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,514
on the police force.
Draw the gate!

136
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,182
Like it here, Fred?

137
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:58,519
I appreciate you taking me on,
Lieutenant.

138
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,182
Considering what you went through...

139
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,193
it's the least I can do.

140
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:04,195
When I think
about your department...

141
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,857
not backing you up,
it makes me sick.

142
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:07,864
Coming through.

143
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:09,901
Once you get used
to the peculiarities...

144
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,199
death row's the best duty
in the joint...

145
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,831
them being locked up
twenty-three hours and all.

146
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:17,774
No, on the yard, only peace we ever got...

147
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:20,437
was when
we racked the cells at night.

148
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:22,309
Hey, cutie. Come on.

149
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:29,953
So I know you probably had
your baton training before...

150
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:32,855
but, uh, a little trick
you should know in here...

151
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:34,893
always keep it next to your thigh.

152
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,621
You don't want it slapping around...

153
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:38,959
hitting one of these inmates.
They start whining...

154
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:41,898
fill out a complaint against you,
ruin your whole day.

155
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:44,936
Just keep it all nice and close,
like that.

156
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:45,971
Thanks, Jerry.

157
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:49,999
Guy was testing you yesterday, Fred.

158
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:51,007
Coming through!

159
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:52,941
That Denver's
one hundred miles of bad road.

160
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,480
Just when I think
I got him smoothed out...

161
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:56,878
he's back rocking and rolling.

162
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:58,280
But you got his number.

163
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,818
I never seen a rookie
take charge like that.

164
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:02,786
You do that with all your prisoners...

165
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,516
you're not gonna have a problem.

166
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,757
Want you to do a favor for me.

167
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,194
Keep an eye on Denver.

168
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:14,755
I wanna know
if he cries to his lawyer.

169
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:15,959
Heh. I can't do that.

170
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,627
He'll just call
for the watch commander.

171
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:21,571
Ah. There's an intercom
outside the visiting room, Fred.

172
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,107
You're doing good.

173
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,439
I think you're gonna work out here.

174
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:26,808
Get back to work.

175
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:42,058
Open 107!

176
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:45,660
Your lawyer's here.
Face the back wall.

177
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:51,258
You're OK now?

178
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:54,499
Yeah, man.
I wanted to thank you.

179
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,541
For what? Move towards me.

180
00:17:56,608 --> 00:18:00,374
For not beating the shit
out of me when I was born.

181
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:01,378
Born?

182
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:03,711
Born, man. Pulled out of the hole.

183
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:06,717
So why didn't you do me
like the others?

184
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:08,719
They don't pay me for that.

185
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:10,049
Of course they do.

186
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,714
Shit, if I was you...

187
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,020
I would've taken a couple of shots...

188
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,321
kicked a little ass.

189
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:16,986
What's wrong, man?
You chickenshit?

190
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:18,859
Move.

191
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,523
Don't get me wrong, man.

192
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,827
I appreciate what you done.

193
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,060
Closing 107!

194
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:24,397
Yo, Raheed! Here's...

195
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:28,497
You let him be, man...

196
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:30,838
or I'll crush your windpipe so flat...

197
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:33,207
you'll be breathing out of your ass.

198
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:39,676
You play games with me, Bayliss...

199
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:41,309
I'll take you down.
You understand me?

200
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:42,944
OI' Jimmy the J
ain't really playing...

201
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:44,352
with a full deck, is he?

202
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:45,981
<i>I mean he's either singing
Unchained Melody...</i>

203
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:46,990
all fucking night long...

204
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,617
or he's talking to his dead mama.

205
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:50,093
Stand against the wall.

206
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:51,424
You're one to talk.

207
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:54,762
Twenty-four hours ago,
you were lying in your own shit.

208
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,130
Face the wall.

209
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:59,693
Naw, man. Twenty-four hours ago,
I was invisible.

210
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:01,762
Every time one of you fuckers
tries and breaks me, man...

211
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,102
I just disappear.

212
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:06,235
I got a place in my mind
you can't even touch.

213
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,369
Turn around.

214
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,312
Let's go.

215
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:10,313
Coming through.

216
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:12,509
When they turn on
those lights, man...

217
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:14,711
it's like Lazarus rising
from the dead.

218
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:15,810
Lazarus.

219
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:17,981
They never used
the electric chair on Lazarus.

220
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:20,115
The only way
you're gonna fucking kill me...

221
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:23,525
is cut my head off and bury it
where I can't find it.

222
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:25,529
Sit down.

223
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:35,703
Coming through.

224
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:37,173
Let's go.

225
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:45,279
I got all of Rothstein's files here.

226
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,251
You and I are gonna pore
over each and every one of 'em.

227
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,288
I want to know everything
there is to know...

228
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,879
about you and your case,
Mr. Bayliss.

229
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:52,889
Denver.

230
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,186
Denver.

231
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:56,420
That means you have to be
completely candid with me...

232
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,554
no lies, nothing withheld.

233
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,097
I don't front my counsel, man.

234
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:03,760
Good. I want to check some facts here
concerning your record.

235
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:04,859
Go ahead.

236
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:07,531
Says here you lived
in three foster homes.

237
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:09,699
Five.

238
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:11,504
First offense?

239
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,636
Shoplifting food.

240
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,976
Which landed you in juvenile hall.

241
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:16,980
That's right.

242
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,017
You killed a boy there.

243
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:21,484
Yeah.

244
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,612
How old were you?

245
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:26,984
Sixteen.

246
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,890
Conviction was
for second-degree murder.

247
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:29,893
Yeah.

248
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:31,896
Judge made an example of you...

249
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:34,228
sentenced you to
an adult maximum-security prison...

250
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:36,563
where you killed your cellmate
at seventeen.

251
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:37,602
That's right.

252
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:38,897
Life sentence.

253
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:40,131
Life.

254
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:41,263
Any good time?

255
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,968
No.

256
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:46,943
Another murder
of a fellow convict...

257
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:49,276
and the murder of
a correctional officer...

258
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:52,317
for which you received
a death sentence.

259
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:55,217
Well, since then,
I've been a model prisoner.

260
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,346
Yeah, he's going over to "A" block.

261
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,823
Yeah. I'll take him over to "A" block.

262
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:03,486
Sandoval goes at 3:00, OK?

263
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:04,529
All right.

264
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:08,926
What's up, Denver?

265
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:23,075
Die, you fuck.

266
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:31,786
Break your fuckin' neck,
you hear me?

267
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:33,119
Just fucking make me.

268
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:34,920
Prisoner targeted!

269
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:37,359
Come on, man.
Fucking kill me.

270
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:39,192
Kill me.

271
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:40,492
Prisoner secure.

272
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:45,797
What's the procedure here?

273
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:47,338
Quiet cell, file a two-thirteen...

274
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,397
but I think Lieutenant's
gonna slap his ass...

275
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,668
back in the hole.

276
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:53,438
Let's try the quiet cell
for now, all right?

277
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:54,479
- OK.
- All right.

278
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:00,942
Hey, hey, hey.

279
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:03,487
To Freddy Whitmore's broken cherry.

280
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:09,859
Hey, Emmett.

281
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:10,860
Hey, Lionel.

282
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:12,362
- How are you?
- Freddy here?

283
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:14,831
Yeah, down at the end of the bar.

284
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:18,331
Heh. There he is.

285
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:19,665
Lieutenant, how's it going?

286
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:21,330
I buy you a drink?

287
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:23,340
Hey, from what I hear...

288
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:25,000
I should buy you one.

289
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:26,669
Did Denver land on you?

290
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:29,009
Yeah. I caught a few, at least.

291
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:30,708
Kicks like a mule.

292
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:32,943
Couple beers, draft.

293
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,986
Congratulations.

294
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:49,059
You hear anything today?

295
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:52,228
Ahem. Didn't say much
till the end of the visit.

296
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:54,795
Uh, said he was in ad-seg, strip cell.

297
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,137
His lawyer didn't seem
so concerned, though...

298
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,801
said he'd look into it.

299
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:02,176
Yeah, well, probably won't make it
past the paper-shuffling stage.

300
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:08,243
What's on your mind, Fred?

301
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:13,149
Just thinking about
when I dragged him out of that hole.

302
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:17,453
Bothers you, doesn't it?

303
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:19,724
A little.

304
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:20,822
Yeah.

305
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,526
Well, that's the normal reaction.

306
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:23,533
Look, listen.

307
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:25,866
Let me tell you about the hole.

308
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:29,429
The hole is a place
where we tell a guy...

309
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:30,873
"This is it, son.

310
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:34,469
"Your shit stops here."
You understand?

311
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:39,848
The hole is a place where we try
to teach a boy like Denver to listen.

312
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:44,388
And, hey, when I first started
on this job...

313
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:47,391
I was just like you.
I went in there.

314
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:49,051
I thought, "Hey, these guys...

315
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:51,425
"they're not
that much different from me."

316
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:54,388
Then it gets hard.

317
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:56,991
See, you watch the way they live...

318
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:59,366
way they treat each other, and...

319
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:04,775
got so I couldn't even eat
my dinner at night.

320
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:08,571
Time changes all that.

321
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:11,479
If you watch 'em long enough...

322
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:15,111
you realize that they are
not like you, not at all.

323
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:18,122
You thank God
when you get to that place...

324
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,784
because then you can
just do the job.

325
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:21,917
You'll get there.

326
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:24,657
Come on.
You know everybody here?

327
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:25,991
Nah. No, I don't.

328
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:28,692
Aw, come on.
Let's go meet a few guys.

329
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:31,324
All right.

330
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:49,584
Wait.

331
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:51,849
What happened?

332
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:53,220
Nothing happened.

333
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:56,783
Yeah. Just like Darrel. Nothing.

334
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:59,387
You got into it, didn't you?

335
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:01,056
I never liked this idea.

336
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:03,726
Yeah, well,
I had to do something, so...

337
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:06,066
It's more dangerous
than being a cop.

338
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:09,231
When you quit the force,
what you 'posed to do...

339
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:11,172
be a security guard or something?

340
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:13,575
Oh, you could find
something else, honey.

341
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:15,237
Have to retrain.

342
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:17,611
I don't got that kind of time...

343
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:20,310
and we don't got
that kind of money.

344
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,614
Remember when we had
that apartment off 103rd...

345
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:28,284
when Darrel was just a baby
and we had him sleeping...

346
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,294
in that dresser drawer pulled out...

347
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,956
and then when we got short of cash...

348
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:36,330
we'd just eat the avocados
off our neighbor's tree?

349
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:39,393
Yeah. Miss Bodeen would be
screaming and shaking.

350
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:40,733
"Shine your shoes...

351
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:43,399
"and pack a change of underwear,
Fred Whitmore...

352
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:46,069
"'cause I'm gonna send you
to your maker."

353
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,775
"You's just an avocado."

354
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:54,847
"You're just an avocado."

355
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,581
I love you, Fred Whitmore.

356
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:49,840
Hey.

357
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,172
You taking me down?

358
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:55,212
I'm taking you to the yard.

359
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:58,677
You listen to me.

360
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,342
Give me any more shit...

361
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:03,581
I'm gonna get myself reassigned.
You understand?

362
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:05,247
You'll be hurting every day.

363
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:08,258
Lionel will probably replace me
with Kurtz or with Durfee...

364
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:09,918
maybe take this tier himself.

365
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:13,294
So you gonna be quiet
when I walk you out of here...

366
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:16,095
or do I get myself
a new assignment right now?

367
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:17,134
I'm cool.

368
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:18,169
Turn around.

369
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,103
Move back towards me.

370
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:29,409
Put your hands over your head
and interlock your fingers.

371
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,846
Down on your knees.

372
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:33,213
Cross your right leg
over your left.

373
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:47,865
Number two.

374
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:07,885
Can I bum a cigarette, man?

375
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:13,622
Ever look at this razor wire?

376
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,717
See the tiny, little Vs?

377
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:20,663
Always remind me of birds
trying to fly out of this place.

378
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:22,791
That crazy?

379
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:23,856
I'd say so.

380
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:26,597
I guess if you stare
at anything long enough...

381
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:28,138
you're bound to see something.

382
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:31,198
All I see is the sky.

383
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:34,074
I haven't seen the sky
except through these wires...

384
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:35,669
for the last two years.

385
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:38,682
Yeah, well, I guess
you shouldn't have murdered people.

386
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,048
Take a life, you take something
that's precious...

387
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,518
you step over the line.

388
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:44,179
You don't just walk away.

389
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:46,519
I don't expect to walk away, man.

390
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:50,857
Keep me in prison for the rest of my life.
I deserve that.

391
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:54,194
I just can't stand
what the row does to you.

392
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:57,530
You ever see these supposed killers
on store day, man?

393
00:28:57,602 --> 00:29:01,197
Get all excited about a cookie
and a pack of cigarettes.

394
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:03,866
Imagine that, getting excited
about a fucking cookie.

395
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:06,536
Makes me just sick to think about it.

396
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:07,771
Know what?

397
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:10,007
I don't want to listen
to your problems.

398
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,673
I ain't got no problems, man.

399
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,945
I got one problem,
and that's the row.

400
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:17,351
I wanna be in main population.
I wanna be in the yard.

401
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,787
I wanna have a job.

402
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:21,348
I wanna be
with the men who get laid.

403
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,553
Heh. I wanna die.

404
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,574
Hey, Fred.

405
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:48,346
Not wearing at home anymore?

406
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:51,479
Gotta go to my kid's
school tonight, parent thing.

407
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:54,150
It's good for 'em to see
the uniform, you know.

408
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:55,487
Prison supports this town...

409
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,188
even though
they don't like to admit it.

410
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:06,433
Fred...

411
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:09,200
Denver's lawyer wants
to see you tomorrow.

412
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:13,039
Now, we can get a union rep in there...

413
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:14,874
or, uh, give you a lawyer
if you'd like.

414
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:17,039
What does he want?

415
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:19,515
Says it's personal.

416
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:21,108
But I don't trust him.

417
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:23,450
I think he wants to raise hell.

418
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:26,456
I'm sorry I got you
involved in all this.

419
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:29,721
Yeah, well, I can handle it.

420
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:31,284
Don't need any backup.

421
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,829
Later.

422
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:39,164
I really want you...

423
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:41,171
I wanna show you my painting.

424
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:42,206
All right.

425
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,576
Oh, this is so nice.

426
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:54,413
I think that's real imaginative, Darrel.

427
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:56,715
Let's ask the renowned art critic...

428
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:58,551
Mr. Frederick of Hollywood...

429
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:01,217
what he thinks of this masterpiece.

430
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:02,691
Mr. Fred?

431
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:06,688
It's OK.

432
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:09,756
No, it... i-it's pretty good, Darrel.

433
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:11,961
Thank you.

434
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,937
Could you show a little enthusiasm,
for God's sake?

435
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:15,973
What you talking about?

436
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,439
I told him it looked good.

437
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:19,135
You don't get it, do you?

438
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,609
What you want me to do...

439
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:22,578
jump up and down
or something like that?

440
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:24,080
Would you lower your voice, please?

441
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:25,115
I'm outta here.

442
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:56,806
You know,
when you were eighteen...

443
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:59,145
and you were cruising
down the boulevard...

444
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:00,980
in that old '57 Chevy...

445
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:05,147
I thought you were really something.

446
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:07,748
Strong and silent...

447
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:10,919
was the sexiest thing
on Earth to me.

448
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:17,098
But mysterious don't wash
with ten-year-olds, Fred.

449
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:20,763
Who do you want me to be, Hope?

450
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:24,171
Honey, just yourself.

451
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:28,008
I am what I am, and I love my son.

452
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:29,546
Then show it.

453
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:30,638
Show it?

454
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:31,977
Yes.

455
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,745
I work a job I hate...

456
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:37,276
so he can have new clothes
and I could pay the rent.

457
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:40,222
I come home straight
from work every night.

458
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,384
I take him to school every morning.

459
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,691
You know, maybe I should show it
like Willy Fuller does...

460
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:47,788
joking around, hugging,
and kissing his kid...

461
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:50,197
the one day a month he sees him.

462
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:52,065
Is that a threat, Fred?

463
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,228
No.

464
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:56,239
When I threaten somebody,
they know it.

465
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:00,710
Don't look at me that way.

466
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:01,904
What way?

467
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,039
You got that crazy look
in your eye...

468
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:05,412
just like your old man.

469
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:08,247
Virgil was not crazy.

470
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,911
Oh, he wasn't? Oh, please.

471
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,956
You can't even call him daddy.

472
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,452
He was a good man.

473
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:22,829
Darrel! Come on. It's time to go.

474
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:57,089
I move my king-rook pawn up one.

475
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:02,097
Bishop to pawn. Check.

476
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:08,875
I move my king into the corner.

477
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:15,145
I move my bishop
back one square. Check.

478
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:19,156
Fucker.

479
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:22,784
I move my king
out of check, over one.

480
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:29,361
I move my queen up one. Check.

481
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:35,299
I move the king over to bishop five...

482
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:37,068
only place I can go.

483
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:42,173
Queen to pawn. Checkmate.

484
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,180
Fuck you!

485
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,045
Fuck you.

486
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:49,609
Does that mean
you don't wanna play again?

487
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:50,711
Coming through.

488
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,391
Hey, Ray.

489
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:57,716
Afternoon, Officer Whitmore.

490
00:34:57,795 --> 00:34:59,387
Afternoon. Have a seat.

491
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,528
The yard seems empty.

492
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:06,536
Used to be swarming
with inmates by this time...

493
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,435
but that was before the days
of administrative lockup.

494
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:09,598
Yeah, well, those writ writers...

495
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:11,938
really brought it down
on themselves, didn't they?

496
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:13,169
Yeah. I guess they did.

497
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:15,178
What can I do for you, Mr. Corbett?

498
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:17,612
I want you to help me nail
Lionel McMannis.

499
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:19,650
Heh. What are you talking about?

500
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:22,652
Man's got a strip cell
going down in ad-seg.

501
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,247
Quiet cell is the most extreme form
of segregation this state allows.

502
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:27,450
He's violating prison regulations.

503
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:29,049
You're full of shit, man.

504
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,391
Full of shit.

505
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,054
Officer Whitmore...

506
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,894
Denver Bayliss
was raised by the state...

507
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,025
and the state did
a pretty rotten job.

508
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:38,830
You know, he's never
committed a violent crime...

509
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:40,200
outside of prison. How could he?

510
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:42,466
They've been shuttling him
in and out of foster homes...

511
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,734
since he was six.

512
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,935
At fourteen, he was already in juvie.

513
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:48,478
By the time he graduated
to this place...

514
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:50,377
he was only sixteen years old.

515
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:51,972
Denver's not just a murderer.

516
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:54,040
Why do people like you make careers...

517
00:35:54,118 --> 00:35:56,416
out of making excuses
for people like him?

518
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,785
I had it bad as a kid, too.

519
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:01,154
I got beat up on by my old man...

520
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:03,819
and I mean bad,
but I never killed nobody.

521
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:05,419
Then why start killing people now?

522
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:06,428
To show killers...

523
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,759
That killing people is wrong?

524
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:08,764
Yeah.

525
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,165
Thanks for your time,
Officer Whitmore.

526
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:13,395
Coming through!

527
00:36:51,108 --> 00:36:52,075
Dinner.

528
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:02,480
What the fuck are you doing?

529
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,578
I'm looking for cockroaches, spit.

530
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:05,917
I find it amazing...

531
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:08,254
you haven't fucked
with my food yet.

532
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:11,261
Not that I'm feeling sorry
for myself or anything.

533
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:14,298
Nah, I bet you never
felt sorry for nothin'.

534
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:17,058
What's that supposed to mean?

535
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:18,829
Talkin' about the people you killed.

536
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,804
Two ways it happened,
man... me and him.

537
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:27,309
Look, I got a letter for you.

538
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:29,278
Who's it from?

539
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:30,678
Lillian Burke.

540
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:34,244
Throw it in the trash.

541
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,446
What the fuck are you doing?

542
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:42,390
It's no big deal. Staff reads
your mail all the time.

543
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,018
Stop reading the fucking letter!

544
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,255
It's from your sister.

545
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:46,455
Stop reading the fucking letter!

546
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,327
What the fuck is your problem?!

547
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:49,889
What the fuck is your problem?

548
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:53,095
Why don't you tell me
why a cop becomes a fucking bull?

549
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,694
Who said I'm a cop?

550
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:57,206
We got no secrets on the row, man.

551
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:00,802
So what'd you do to get buried
in this fucking tomb, huh?

552
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:01,810
What, you crooked?

553
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:03,710
You kill Whitey?

554
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,043
Ohh...

555
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:08,176
I see a white boy's funeral
in those eyes.

556
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:11,182
Never killed nobody.

557
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:12,313
You fucker.

558
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:27,870
My fucking dinner's cold.

559
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,177
Hey, Denver, man.

560
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:39,238
Denver.

561
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,249
Yo, Denver!

562
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,307
What?

563
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:44,183
Hey, listen, my woman
she sent me this book...

564
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:45,313
<i>Bartlett's Quotations.</i>

565
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:47,482
She's telling me, like,
spice up my letters...

566
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:49,355
you know,
with romantic lines and shit.

567
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:51,793
Hey, why don't you
just try to spice 'em up...

568
00:38:51,862 --> 00:38:53,523
with some lines she can read, eh?

569
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:55,326
Hey, I don't listen to fools, now.

570
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:57,492
So, Denver, l...

571
00:38:57,568 --> 00:38:59,536
I been reading this book, you know...

572
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:01,264
and l... I ain't gettin' nowhere.

573
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:04,536
L... I just wondered could you
help me out a little bit?

574
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:06,633
Yeah, all right.

575
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:09,236
Why don't you tell me about her.

576
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:12,942
Um, well, her name's Mary.

577
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,814
She's, uh...

578
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:16,853
real pretty.

579
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:19,754
She's, uh... she's about 5'3"

580
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:21,724
small, you know.

581
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:25,455
Kind of delicate.

582
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:28,191
Yeah. Yeah, she's delicate.

583
00:39:28,265 --> 00:39:31,200
And she got these
real tiny hands, you know...

584
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:32,235
like real delicate.

585
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:39,465
She's got long, black hair,
like down to her hips, you know.

586
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:45,011
She got one of them waists, man...

587
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:47,710
that you can, like,
wrap your whole hands around.

588
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:52,247
And her skin is...

589
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:54,689
really smooth, like glass...

590
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:56,954
except it's warm.

591
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:04,058
Goddamn. You know,
I can almost feel it myself.

592
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:08,062
So what do I say?

593
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:11,074
Hey, Denver, man,
what do I put down here?

594
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:13,735
Man's walking.

595
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:41,062
Do that again.

596
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:48,074
Thank you, father, for this food
we are about to receive...

597
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:49,578
for the nourishment of our bodies.

598
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:51,410
In Christ's name, we pray. Amen.

599
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:52,449
- Amen.
- Amen.

600
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:55,451
Darrel, did you wash your hands?

601
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:56,451
Yeah.

602
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,487
All right.

603
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:02,381
They just laid off
the tool and die people.

604
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,087
Didn't even get lunch today.

605
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:07,690
You talk to the union?

606
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:10,233
What union?

607
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,895
How much longer
you think you got, Hope?

608
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:15,939
I figure I got
maybe two or three months.

609
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:19,498
Heh. Heh.

610
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:21,670
OK.

611
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:24,043
So we gotta make some plans, then.

612
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:29,749
You lose this job, Hope,
we're gonna go belly up.

613
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,482
We got nothing to fall back on.
Nothing.

614
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,293
We'll be all right.

615
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:05,549
Fred.

616
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:08,790
Hey.

617
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:14,364
You still up?

618
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:20,529
You think maybe that you could
stay home sometime with Darrel...

619
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:23,402
and I could go out for once?

620
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:25,101
Sure.

621
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:30,608
Well, you think maybe
we could go out together sometime?

622
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:33,775
You know, married folks do do that.

623
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:35,011
Wanna go dancing?

624
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:37,713
Tch. Where?

625
00:42:37,788 --> 00:42:39,153
The Lighthouse.

626
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,783
They closed that joint down.

627
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:45,818
Some fool was selling crack
in the men's room or something.

628
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:47,124
Starlight, then.

629
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:52,628
You think you still know
how to dance?

630
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:53,965
Get out of here.

631
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:55,437
L... I can cook, girl.

632
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:56,905
Are you... come here.

633
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:58,032
Let me see.

634
00:42:58,108 --> 00:43:00,338
Let me show you my moves.

635
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,343
Get up, there.

636
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:02,344
Come to me.

637
00:43:05,115 --> 00:43:07,083
OK, OK, OK.

638
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:13,017
OK, now give me
your hand right here.

639
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:16,985
Move in close, like that.

640
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:33,768
I love when you sing to me.

641
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:46,988
Yes.

642
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:49,457
Oh, baby, this is it.

643
00:43:51,562 --> 00:43:52,529
Oh, baby.

644
00:43:58,268 --> 00:43:59,929
Fred.

645
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:01,596
Huh?

646
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:03,003
Come to bed.

647
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:06,236
All right. Ahem.

648
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:11,473
Maybe you should just ask
for another assignment.

649
00:44:11,548 --> 00:44:14,415
I see how this duty's torturing you.

650
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:15,747
Yard's the only alternative.

651
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:18,515
Get killed there
a hell of a lot easier...

652
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:20,386
then to get killed on death row.

653
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:22,288
There's gotta be a way out.

654
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:26,262
You remember that horse
in the stables in the park...

655
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,355
the one that you used to ride?

656
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:29,865
What was that horse's name?

657
00:44:29,933 --> 00:44:31,833
Asphodel, like the flower.

658
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:35,731
Be nice to have
a horse named Asphodel...

659
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:37,103
growing in our backyard.

660
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,977
Nice.

661
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:54,755
Motherfuckers ain't gonna get me.

662
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:57,988
Fuckin' motherfuckers!
You're not gonna get me!

663
00:44:58,062 --> 00:44:59,927
- Fuckin'...
- Hey! Quiet!

664
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:03,023
Hey, you tell me why I been
wearin' these, motherfucker.

665
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,694
It... I'm wearin' it
because I'm on suicide watch.

666
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:07,361
You been up all night?

667
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:09,372
Get over there and lay down.

668
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,407
Get some sleep.

669
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:15,136
You tell 'em...

670
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,407
I'm not wearin' those bastards anymore.

671
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:18,812
I'll tell them.

672
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:21,214
You better, motherfucker.

673
00:45:21,285 --> 00:45:25,187
I will. Just lie down
and get some sleep.

674
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:26,722
Relax.

675
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:41,904
How you doing?

676
00:45:45,642 --> 00:45:48,475
Old Raheed kept me up
all fucking night...

677
00:45:48,545 --> 00:45:50,809
crying about his first day in jail...

678
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:53,907
how they taunted him
and beat him.

679
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:55,076
Jesus Christ.

680
00:45:55,152 --> 00:45:57,916
My first day in juvie,
they asked me two questions...

681
00:45:57,988 --> 00:46:01,287
you got any enemies in here,
and who's your next of kin?

682
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:03,553
Then they shaved my head
and threw me...

683
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:06,391
in a fucking holding tank
with a gang of Mexicans...

684
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:09,398
who proceeded to beat
the shit out of me.

685
00:46:11,635 --> 00:46:15,002
I think I cried then.

686
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:17,563
I was only fourteen.

687
00:46:17,641 --> 00:46:20,439
What happened?
You and Jimmy go at it again?

688
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:25,081
How... how the fuck's
another inmate...

689
00:46:25,149 --> 00:46:27,777
gonna lay a baton across my face?

690
00:46:27,851 --> 00:46:28,783
What did you do?

691
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:29,841
You don't have to do anything.

692
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,080
I didn't do anything, man.

693
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:34,022
They like to beat on me,
just knock a couple teeth out...

694
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:35,752
so they can see your fucking skull.

695
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:37,987
It doesn't matter.
Just do me a big favor.

696
00:46:38,061 --> 00:46:40,621
Don't take too many days off, OK?

697
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:52,236
Shit.

698
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:54,906
Is there a disturbance?

699
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:57,708
Yeah. Somebody tuned up
Denver Bayliss.

700
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:01,248
Durfee, night watch.

701
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:02,910
He didn't throw on nobody?

702
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:04,578
Not that I'm aware of.

703
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,555
Have you seen
the prisoner, Lieutenant?

704
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:07,555
Not yet.

705
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:09,683
Durfee used a baton on his head.

706
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,227
Right. That's what I'm told.

707
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:14,093
Verbal abuse is not an excuse
for hitting somebody...

708
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:15,290
Don't you tell me about excuses.

709
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:16,889
You don't know
that son of a bitch.

710
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:18,298
You don't know
what he's capable of.

711
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:22,134
Bullshit! I'm not gonna let that happen
to any prisoners on my tier.

712
00:47:22,206 --> 00:47:23,138
- Your tier?!
- You understand?

713
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:24,435
What the hell's
the matter with you?

714
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:25,736
That boy giving you
the Oriental massage?

715
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:30,303
I took a ride with you, Lieutenant,
kept my mouth shut...

716
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:34,214
but you don't do something
about this, I will.

717
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:35,216
When's Durfee coming in?

718
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:36,752
You gonna drop a note
on one of my officers?

719
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:37,787
I do what I gotta do.

720
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,618
You're suspended...
four days, no pay.

721
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:40,850
What are you talking...

722
00:47:40,924 --> 00:47:42,721
I run this unit, not you.

723
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:45,227
You go home and you sit
and try to imagine...

724
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:47,456
what it's like to run a unit like this.

725
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:49,465
Can't believe I'm getting
this shit from you.

726
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,228
You're suspended.
Get out of my face.

727
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:53,269
I don't wanna see you till next week.

728
00:48:02,346 --> 00:48:05,474
Get me Durfee.
I wanna see him on the tier.

729
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:06,948
Lock down every fucking prisoner.

730
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:08,416
Start racking those cells now.

731
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:43,542
It's rebuilt.

732
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:45,884
Should get another 40,000 out of this.

733
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:49,323
Look. Forest Plaza Mall
is hiring security.

734
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:51,861
I circled it for you right there.

735
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,396
Commercial property.

736
00:48:55,132 --> 00:48:57,657
The least I'll take is head of security.

737
00:48:57,734 --> 00:48:59,599
I got twelve years police experience.

738
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:01,865
Yeah, and they asked you to leave.

739
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:05,773
Honey, I'm sorry. Look, nobody's
gonna make you the boss right off.

740
00:49:05,842 --> 00:49:07,332
Y- you gotta work your way up.

741
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:09,208
Yeah, what, at 250 a week?

742
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:11,372
I can work
at a fast-food joint for that.

743
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:13,507
Look, I got full medical
at the prison, OK?

744
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:15,983
Yeah, until they put you
on suspension.

745
00:49:16,053 --> 00:49:19,022
Fuck! I got three more days, all right?

746
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:20,954
I got three days,
and I'm back at work, all right?

747
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:22,719
So you just stay the fuck
out of my face!

748
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:25,819
Look, you're not meant
for this kind of work, Fred.

749
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:27,261
Why don't you see that?

750
00:49:27,331 --> 00:49:29,959
What are you trying to say to me?

751
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:33,961
You trying to tell me...

752
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:35,299
I'm not man enough?

753
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:37,340
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

754
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:38,931
You trying to tell me
I can't handle this?

755
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:40,101
No. No, you can't.

756
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:42,907
You can't, and you don't have
the sense to get yourself out...

757
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,311
of a bad situation.
Y- you're weak...

758
00:49:45,749 --> 00:49:48,343
No more of this! You promised me!

759
00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:49,908
I'm... I'm sorry, all right?

760
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:54,723
What did you do to her?

761
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:57,624
You go inside.
You talk to your mom.

762
00:49:57,694 --> 00:49:59,889
You do it! Tell her you're sorry!

763
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:02,625
She don't wanna talk
to me right now, Darrel.

764
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:04,030
Then neither do I!

765
00:53:17,994 --> 00:53:19,359
Where's your mom at?

766
00:53:19,429 --> 00:53:21,590
Out.

767
00:53:21,665 --> 00:53:23,599
She say she... where's she's going...

768
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:24,929
when she'd be back?

769
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:25,968
No.

770
00:53:27,337 --> 00:53:28,964
Salt, pepper?

771
00:53:37,747 --> 00:53:38,873
Darrel...

772
00:53:41,451 --> 00:53:43,146
I saw your room.

773
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,949
You gonna beat me?

774
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:50,126
No, but I want you to clean it up.

775
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,821
So why you do that?

776
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:55,330
Why'd you hit mom?

777
00:53:57,534 --> 00:53:59,627
I shouldn't have done it.

778
00:53:59,703 --> 00:54:01,534
I shouldn't have done it.

779
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:06,039
I'm just going through
a lot of stuff right now.

780
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:13,343
What's that?

781
00:54:16,152 --> 00:54:19,610
It's a horse belonged
to your uncle Tim.

782
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:21,179
You want it?

783
00:54:25,895 --> 00:54:27,487
Go clean up your room.

784
00:54:27,564 --> 00:54:29,156
Go clean up your room.

785
00:54:29,232 --> 00:54:32,099
I got this. Go clean up your room.

786
00:54:50,687 --> 00:54:51,619
Hello.

787
00:54:51,688 --> 00:54:53,747
Hello. L-is this Fred Whitmore?

788
00:54:53,823 --> 00:54:54,847
Yeah. Who's this?

789
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:56,186
This is Kathy Rubicek.

790
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:58,022
I'm from the appeals project.

791
00:54:58,094 --> 00:54:59,686
What do you want?

792
00:54:59,763 --> 00:55:02,596
I'd like to talk to you
about Denver Bayliss.

793
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:04,827
Look, l... I know that he was beaten...

794
00:55:04,901 --> 00:55:07,062
and I know that
you're on suspension...

795
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,298
for speaking up on his behalf.

796
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:11,067
Can we talk?

797
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:12,733
I got nothing to say.

798
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:14,743
Mr. Whitmore,
I- I'm really not trying...

799
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:16,904
to make any trouble for you here.

800
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,210
There is a pattern of abuse
that's emerging...

801
00:55:19,282 --> 00:55:21,512
and I am concerned
for the inmate's safety.

802
00:55:21,584 --> 00:55:23,017
Will you meet me somewhere?

803
00:55:32,262 --> 00:55:33,194
Where?

804
00:55:33,263 --> 00:55:34,958
Uh, well, right now...

805
00:55:35,031 --> 00:55:36,999
I'm... I'm downtown at the...

806
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:38,898
Too far. No.

807
00:55:38,968 --> 00:55:41,232
All right. Then I'll come to you.

808
00:55:41,304 --> 00:55:42,931
Name the place.

809
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:45,270
Meet me at L.J.'s Bar and Grill.

810
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:49,472
It's about, uh, fifteen minutes
south of, uh, the prison.

811
00:55:49,546 --> 00:55:51,138
Just take post road, OK?

812
00:55:51,214 --> 00:55:53,580
L.J.'s Bar and Grill. Thirty minutes.

813
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:55,584
OK, great. I'll see you there.

814
00:56:12,402 --> 00:56:13,664
Here.

815
00:56:16,439 --> 00:56:17,371
Fred Whitmore.

816
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,998
Kathy Rubicek.

817
00:56:19,075 --> 00:56:20,804
Appeals project.

818
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:22,469
You wanna order some things?

819
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:24,479
Uh, no. But can I get...

820
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:27,038
a cup of coffee with cream, please?

821
00:56:27,117 --> 00:56:30,518
I wanna thank you for coming down here
to talk with me.

822
00:56:30,587 --> 00:56:31,679
I really appreciate this.

823
00:56:31,755 --> 00:56:33,985
What do you want from me?

824
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:36,218
Well, we're concerned
about Denver Bayliss...

825
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:38,624
and other inmates on death row.

826
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:40,128
I mean...

827
00:56:41,498 --> 00:56:44,899
I don't have to tell you
how they're being treated.

828
00:56:44,968 --> 00:56:48,404
We'd like to use Bayliss
as plaintiff in a test case...

829
00:56:48,471 --> 00:56:50,962
but the facts are pretty hard
to document.

830
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,167
Unless you get a guard to testify.

831
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:55,643
Well, you've already taken a stand,
Mr. Whitmore.

832
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:57,771
I didn't take a stand.
I made a big mistake.

833
00:56:57,847 --> 00:56:59,280
Well, that's not how I see it.

834
00:56:59,349 --> 00:57:01,044
Who gives a fuck how you see it?

835
00:57:01,117 --> 00:57:02,584
What the fuck you know about it?

836
00:57:02,652 --> 00:57:03,914
You ever been inside death row?

837
00:57:05,688 --> 00:57:08,350
I used to represent Denver Bayliss.

838
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:12,623
So why you quit?

839
00:57:12,695 --> 00:57:13,684
He quit me.

840
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:16,698
I bet you were really relieved.
I bet that.

841
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:17,698
Yes, I was.

842
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:20,429
Because he is a sick bastard.

843
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:23,538
Because...

844
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:26,166
I started to care about him.

845
00:57:26,242 --> 00:57:28,836
And that's not an easy thing to do.

846
00:57:28,912 --> 00:57:31,142
H- how can you care about
somebody like that?

847
00:57:31,214 --> 00:57:32,579
- How could you?
- I don't.

848
00:57:32,649 --> 00:57:33,741
Then why are you here?

849
00:57:33,817 --> 00:57:35,307
I wanted to say no to you.

850
00:57:35,385 --> 00:57:37,148
Well, you could've done
that on the telephone.

851
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:39,882
No, no. I wanted to say no
to you to your face.

852
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:43,016
See, Corbett, he figures
he send a woman over here...

853
00:57:43,092 --> 00:57:44,081
soften me up.

854
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,094
I know when I'm getting played.

855
00:57:46,162 --> 00:57:49,222
Mr. Whitmore, Mr. Whit... sit down.

856
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:52,393
Please, sit down.

857
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,505
You're right about Denver.

858
00:57:58,575 --> 00:57:59,974
He is sick.

859
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:03,544
He just really got under my skin.

860
00:58:04,881 --> 00:58:08,442
And when he saw that,
he wanted to go deeper.

861
00:58:08,518 --> 00:58:10,110
And he'd just kind of...

862
00:58:10,186 --> 00:58:11,915
divine whatever was bothering me...

863
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:14,252
and... and just wanna go
straight into it...

864
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,792
like he wanted...

865
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:19,658
a companion in his suffering.

866
00:58:19,729 --> 00:58:22,027
That man drove me up the wall.

867
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:26,100
How's he doing?

868
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:27,761
He's not so good.

869
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:29,464
Then help us, Mr. Whitmore.

870
00:58:29,539 --> 00:58:30,563
What do you say?

871
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:31,732
I don't... I don't know why...

872
00:58:31,808 --> 00:58:33,366
everybody's asking me
for something, you know.

873
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:35,536
I got a lot of problems of my own.

874
00:58:37,247 --> 00:58:39,340
You want me to tell him I saw you?

875
00:58:40,416 --> 00:58:41,383
No.

876
00:58:59,769 --> 00:59:03,034
"I understand
you're seeing another man."

877
00:59:05,008 --> 00:59:07,568
What comes next?

878
00:59:07,644 --> 00:59:10,238
Hey, Denver, what...
what do I say to her?

879
00:59:10,313 --> 00:59:12,781
Tell her, "But understanding
cannot relieve the pain"...

880
00:59:12,849 --> 00:59:14,783
and it's only thoughts of her...

881
00:59:14,851 --> 00:59:16,785
that get you through each day.

882
00:59:16,853 --> 00:59:19,447
Oh, hey, God damn it,
slow down, man. Please?

883
00:59:19,522 --> 00:59:22,116
I mean, I ain't using
no computer here.

884
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:27,151
All right,
"Understanding cannot relieve the pain."

885
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,025
Yeah. What's after that?

886
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:31,691
It sounds like drivel.

887
00:59:31,768 --> 00:59:32,735
It's what?

888
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:34,667
It's drivel!

889
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:37,900
Drivel? What... what's drivel?

890
00:59:37,974 --> 00:59:39,669
It's drivel. It's shit.

891
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:41,209
No. No, it ain't, man.

892
00:59:41,277 --> 00:59:44,371
This is... this is almost as good
as any greeting card.

893
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:53,154
Hey, Denver, man,
I got some pruno for you.

894
00:59:53,222 --> 00:59:56,658
Yes, ma'am.
A little fruit of the vine...

895
00:59:56,726 --> 00:59:59,923
Denver Bayliss bound.

896
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:01,361
Yes, indeed.

897
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:23,046
Coming down.

898
01:00:59,756 --> 01:01:00,814
Shit.

899
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:04,816
Working next watch?

900
01:01:04,894 --> 01:01:06,623
- No.
- No?

901
01:01:06,696 --> 01:01:07,924
All right.

902
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:10,261
Why don't you come down to L.J.'s?

903
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:13,268
In two and a half hours,
I'll buy you a beer.

904
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:14,303
I'll be ready.

905
01:01:32,889 --> 01:01:34,823
Give it up, Denver.

906
01:01:34,891 --> 01:01:36,654
I don't know
what you're talking about.

907
01:01:36,726 --> 01:01:37,852
Open up 107!

908
01:01:38,928 --> 01:01:40,293
Face the wall!

909
01:01:43,232 --> 01:01:46,497
I can smell that rancid shit
on your breath, hmm.

910
01:01:46,569 --> 01:01:48,537
Where's the fucking cup?!

911
01:01:48,604 --> 01:01:50,538
You spitting on me, punk?

912
01:01:50,606 --> 01:01:52,039
You spit on me?!

913
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:11,521
Coming through!

914
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,660
Lieutenant!

915
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:23,331
Don't you ever
fucking touch me again.

916
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:25,704
Put that prisoner back in his cell.

917
01:02:28,144 --> 01:02:29,338
Stand back!

918
01:02:31,114 --> 01:02:32,445
Get back!

919
01:02:35,184 --> 01:02:37,345
You come back here, motherfucker!

920
01:02:45,862 --> 01:02:48,092
Close 107!

921
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:55,830
What the fuck is wrong with you?

922
01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:58,203
First day back on the job,
you read me a wolf ticket?

923
01:02:58,274 --> 01:02:59,764
You don't got the right to torture him.

924
01:02:59,842 --> 01:03:02,333
He gave me that right when he drug
Timmy Bailey into that cell...

925
01:03:02,411 --> 01:03:04,106
and cut his throat
clear to the neck bone.

926
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:05,238
That boy was twenty-one years old!

927
01:03:05,314 --> 01:03:06,246
I can't...

928
01:03:06,315 --> 01:03:07,373
You go against me
on this, Whitmore...

929
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:08,974
you are going against
every correctional officer...

930
01:03:09,051 --> 01:03:10,348
in this facility.
You understand me?!

931
01:03:10,419 --> 01:03:11,351
Coming through!

932
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:14,252
You cannot beat me on this row!

933
01:03:31,174 --> 01:03:32,766
Can I help you, officer?

934
01:03:32,842 --> 01:03:35,367
Yes, sir. I'd like to file a complaint.

935
01:03:35,444 --> 01:03:36,376
Regarding?

936
01:03:36,445 --> 01:03:38,106
My lieutenant.

937
01:03:38,181 --> 01:03:41,378
You should really talk to the captain
of your housing unit first and...

938
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:43,509
No. There's no time for that.

939
01:03:43,586 --> 01:03:46,646
We really need to take care
of this right now, sir.

940
01:03:46,722 --> 01:03:48,587
You have five minutes.

941
01:04:03,906 --> 01:04:05,498
Bayliss, you got a visitor.

942
01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:07,509
Who is it, man, my lawyer?

943
01:04:07,577 --> 01:04:09,442
No, woman. Lillian Burke.

944
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:13,308
Tell her to go home.

945
01:04:15,551 --> 01:04:16,813
OK.

946
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:35,526
What's going on?

947
01:04:35,605 --> 01:04:38,733
Hey, man, I never got
a chance to thank you...

948
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:41,333
for pulling that maniac off of me. Thanks.

949
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:42,672
You got a visitor.

950
01:04:43,946 --> 01:04:45,880
I said you got a visitor.

951
01:04:45,948 --> 01:04:46,880
No, I don't.

952
01:04:46,949 --> 01:04:48,507
Look...

953
01:04:48,584 --> 01:04:50,518
the return address is Elko, right?

954
01:04:50,586 --> 01:04:51,848
That's three hundred miles away.

955
01:04:51,921 --> 01:04:53,513
She ain't gonna be back.

956
01:04:53,589 --> 01:04:55,523
Why do you give a shit?

957
01:04:55,591 --> 01:04:57,218
I don't.

958
01:04:57,293 --> 01:04:59,818
Well, neither do I.

959
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,261
Who else you got?

960
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:05,963
Why don't you get your clothes.
Come on.

961
01:05:11,274 --> 01:05:12,935
Coming through the door.

962
01:05:13,009 --> 01:05:13,976
It's this way.

963
01:05:18,648 --> 01:05:20,411
Let's go.

964
01:05:20,483 --> 01:05:21,450
Come on.

965
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:37,793
Hi, Denny.

966
01:05:37,867 --> 01:05:39,892
It's so good to see you.

967
01:05:48,377 --> 01:05:51,972
They did let me bring some things in,
like my book.

968
01:05:52,048 --> 01:05:54,312
Oh. I've got a surprise for you.

969
01:05:54,383 --> 01:05:55,350
You wanna see?

970
01:05:58,054 --> 01:06:00,249
Look.

971
01:06:00,323 --> 01:06:01,415
Who is it?

972
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:03,253
They're my children.

973
01:06:03,326 --> 01:06:05,419
I thought you only had one.

974
01:06:05,494 --> 01:06:09,794
Well, I have been writing you
twice a month since Sarah was born.

975
01:06:09,865 --> 01:06:11,730
What are their names?

976
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:14,599
Well, Sarah, of course. She's six.

977
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:16,661
That's Mary. She's four.

978
01:06:16,739 --> 01:06:18,502
And this is Matthew Denver.

979
01:06:18,574 --> 01:06:20,474
He's two. Two.

980
01:06:22,044 --> 01:06:23,807
Matthew Denver.

981
01:06:23,879 --> 01:06:24,903
I know.

982
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:28,576
I was going to call him Denver,
but it's not Biblical.

983
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:31,484
I was gonna change my name
legally once. You know that?

984
01:06:31,554 --> 01:06:33,021
To what?

985
01:06:33,089 --> 01:06:34,681
Fort Worth.

986
01:06:35,925 --> 01:06:39,258
Where was mama's head
when she gave you that name?

987
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:41,262
Thank God it wasn't in Albuquerque.

988
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:44,663
Gosh, you always did tickle me,
you know.

989
01:06:44,734 --> 01:06:48,192
Yeah, but you were easy, Lil.
You laugh at everything.

990
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:53,572
Hey, do you remember wh...

991
01:06:53,642 --> 01:06:56,440
when Gillis was living with mama...

992
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:59,310
and you placed
that darning needle...

993
01:06:59,382 --> 01:07:01,816
under his beach chair?

994
01:07:02,985 --> 01:07:04,612
Stuck right in his ass.

995
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:06,450
Launched him right out of the chair.

996
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:08,319
No...

997
01:07:08,391 --> 01:07:10,325
we took him to the hospital.

998
01:07:10,393 --> 01:07:11,724
Five stitches.

999
01:07:11,794 --> 01:07:13,819
Stuck like a pig, he was.

1000
01:07:13,896 --> 01:07:17,332
And, oh, sitting on that ice bag.

1001
01:07:18,401 --> 01:07:20,198
I know.

1002
01:07:23,506 --> 01:07:25,201
That son of a bitch.

1003
01:07:25,274 --> 01:07:27,834
I should have fucking killed him.

1004
01:07:29,345 --> 01:07:31,643
You never asked me how Bill is.

1005
01:07:33,983 --> 01:07:35,917
How is Bill?

1006
01:07:35,985 --> 01:07:38,852
Well, he's doing very well.

1007
01:07:38,921 --> 01:07:41,185
Now, he's still
working the swing shift...

1008
01:07:41,257 --> 01:07:44,249
but we're very, very happy
that he's working...

1009
01:07:44,326 --> 01:07:47,591
you know, the way they've been
laying people off nowadays.

1010
01:07:47,663 --> 01:07:50,291
You ever tell your kids
about me, Lil?

1011
01:07:51,801 --> 01:07:54,235
You just tell 'em I'm away, huh?

1012
01:07:55,337 --> 01:07:58,329
No. I tell them the truth.

1013
01:07:58,407 --> 01:07:59,874
What's the truth?

1014
01:07:59,942 --> 01:08:02,206
I tell them that you did wrong...

1015
01:08:02,278 --> 01:08:04,940
and for that,
you are being punished.

1016
01:08:05,014 --> 01:08:07,175
What else do you tell 'em?

1017
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:09,479
You don't give too many details...

1018
01:08:09,552 --> 01:08:11,543
to a six-year-old.

1019
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:13,952
Oh, honey...

1020
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:16,048
it's time.

1021
01:08:16,125 --> 01:08:17,786
For what?

1022
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:19,794
You've got to make your peace...

1023
01:08:19,862 --> 01:08:21,796
with the Lord.

1024
01:08:21,864 --> 01:08:22,853
I do?

1025
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:25,560
Yes, and he'll forgive you.

1026
01:08:25,634 --> 01:08:31,470
All you have to do is open your heart
and receive him.

1027
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:33,132
And what if I don't?

1028
01:08:33,209 --> 01:08:35,609
Then you will go to hell.

1029
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:38,874
No. No, you must pay attention to me.

1030
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:41,781
It's not funny. Don't laugh at me.

1031
01:08:41,851 --> 01:08:43,614
Please, listen.

1032
01:08:43,686 --> 01:08:44,948
Here. Here it says...

1033
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:48,285
"If you deny the Christ
before the sons of man...

1034
01:08:48,357 --> 01:08:50,951
"then God will not receive you...

1035
01:08:51,026 --> 01:08:53,620
"as his own before
the hosts of heaven.

1036
01:08:53,696 --> 01:08:54,993
"Behold, the holy breath...

1037
01:08:55,064 --> 01:08:57,658
"shall teach you
in your hour of need."

1038
01:08:57,733 --> 01:08:59,166
This is what I need.

1039
01:09:05,908 --> 01:09:07,307
Shit! Fuck!

1040
01:09:12,047 --> 01:09:13,446
No!

1041
01:09:13,516 --> 01:09:14,813
You don't move!

1042
01:09:14,884 --> 01:09:16,317
You don't move!

1043
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:20,121
I'm sorry. I didn't know...

1044
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:23,681
Go!

1045
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,387
Why did you do that to her?

1046
01:09:26,462 --> 01:09:28,589
Why the fuck
did you do that to her?!

1047
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:30,655
'Cause I felt like it!

1048
01:09:30,733 --> 01:09:32,064
I protected you, Goddamn it.

1049
01:09:32,134 --> 01:09:33,999
I put my ass on the line...

1050
01:09:34,069 --> 01:09:36,264
and you make a fool out of me!

1051
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:37,396
This isn't about you.

1052
01:09:37,473 --> 01:09:38,940
It's about me and her,
you son of a bitch.

1053
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:43,941
Come on, man. Hit me again.

1054
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:46,709
You're just a fucking pig.
You're just like him.

1055
01:09:46,782 --> 01:09:48,977
I am nothing like Virgil.

1056
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,687
Who the fuck is Virgil, man?

1057
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:55,851
Move.

1058
01:09:59,962 --> 01:10:01,896
Who the fuck is Virgil, man?

1059
01:10:01,964 --> 01:10:03,727
I was talking about Lionel.

1060
01:10:03,799 --> 01:10:06,165
Why you so hot for me
to see my sister?

1061
01:10:06,235 --> 01:10:07,725
What, you got family problems
or something?

1062
01:10:07,803 --> 01:10:08,770
Go to the gate.

1063
01:10:08,837 --> 01:10:10,429
I see you wearing
that wedding ring, man...

1064
01:10:10,506 --> 01:10:12,497
but I don't ever hear you talk
about your wife.

1065
01:10:12,575 --> 01:10:14,372
I don't even know if you got a kid.

1066
01:10:14,443 --> 01:10:16,411
Shut up and face the wall.

1067
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:27,519
Through the door
and face the wall.

1068
01:10:43,973 --> 01:10:45,600
What you doing out there?

1069
01:10:48,944 --> 01:10:51,003
What you doing?

1070
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:52,479
Just playing.

1071
01:10:52,548 --> 01:10:53,776
Your mom home?

1072
01:10:53,849 --> 01:10:57,182
She called,
said she's working overtime.

1073
01:10:58,487 --> 01:11:00,421
What you hiding behind your back?

1074
01:11:00,489 --> 01:11:01,751
Nothing.

1075
01:11:01,824 --> 01:11:03,849
Don't lie to me.

1076
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:09,159
What the hell is this?

1077
01:11:09,231 --> 01:11:11,062
It's for Jerry Coombs.

1078
01:11:11,133 --> 01:11:14,034
You told me that
you beat him straight up.

1079
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:15,365
He keeps coming back.

1080
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:17,735
And you're gonna use this on him?

1081
01:11:20,209 --> 01:11:22,143
You never beat him.

1082
01:11:22,211 --> 01:11:24,475
He's been picking on you, hasn't he?

1083
01:11:24,546 --> 01:11:26,810
Why don't you tell
your teacher about this?

1084
01:11:26,882 --> 01:11:28,247
I'm not a pussy.

1085
01:11:28,317 --> 01:11:29,841
Hey, you don't talk like that,
you hear me?

1086
01:11:29,918 --> 01:11:32,409
I could fight my own fights,
just like you did.

1087
01:11:32,488 --> 01:11:35,924
I want you to tell your teacher
about this. You understand me?

1088
01:11:35,991 --> 01:11:37,117
Yeah.
You understand me?

1089
01:11:37,192 --> 01:11:38,124
Yeah.

1090
01:11:38,193 --> 01:11:39,626
Go inside.

1091
01:11:39,695 --> 01:11:40,992
Go inside.

1092
01:12:37,386 --> 01:12:39,820
Where's the Goddamn sun, man?

1093
01:12:39,888 --> 01:12:42,152
Never get a tan on the row.

1094
01:12:42,224 --> 01:12:45,159
White guy in here turns so pale,
looks like...

1095
01:12:45,227 --> 01:12:47,161
they're slowly trying to erase him.

1096
01:12:47,229 --> 01:12:50,392
Why don't you save your sob stories
for your fancy lawyer friends.

1097
01:12:50,466 --> 01:12:52,024
They get off on that shit.

1098
01:12:52,101 --> 01:12:53,227
Not me.

1099
01:12:53,302 --> 01:12:55,065
I wanna hear
about Timmy Bailey...

1100
01:12:55,137 --> 01:12:57,196
about how you took
a twenty-one-year-old kid...

1101
01:12:57,272 --> 01:12:59,069
and nearly cut his head off.

1102
01:12:59,141 --> 01:13:00,699
You whup me every day, man...

1103
01:13:00,776 --> 01:13:02,573
I'm still coming out of that cell.

1104
01:13:02,644 --> 01:13:03,906
I get the last word.

1105
01:13:03,979 --> 01:13:05,241
You guys'll never own me.

1106
01:13:05,314 --> 01:13:07,373
It's the only freedom I got in here.

1107
01:13:07,449 --> 01:13:09,508
It's the only thing
that keeps me going.

1108
01:13:09,585 --> 01:13:12,679
You're trying to tell me
that this kid beat you down?

1109
01:13:12,755 --> 01:13:14,689
No. He was set up.

1110
01:13:14,757 --> 01:13:15,849
Oh, yeah? By who?

1111
01:13:15,924 --> 01:13:17,050
By the other bulls.

1112
01:13:17,126 --> 01:13:18,491
Bullshit. I don't believe you.

1113
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,323
Go ahead, man. Ask 'em.
They'll tell you.

1114
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:21,920
They got a big laugh out of it...

1115
01:13:21,997 --> 01:13:23,965
right up until the point
I slit his fucking throat.

1116
01:13:25,033 --> 01:13:26,500
How'd they set him up?

1117
01:13:26,568 --> 01:13:29,765
I had a broken cheekbone
and my jaw.

1118
01:13:29,838 --> 01:13:31,669
Another inmate hit me
with a piece of steel cable.

1119
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:34,402
I'd been begging
for a doctor for a week.

1120
01:13:34,476 --> 01:13:35,738
They finally gave in.

1121
01:13:35,811 --> 01:13:37,802
I got all excited in my cell.

1122
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:38,972
I waited all day.

1123
01:13:39,047 --> 01:13:41,038
About 6:00,
I look down the tier...

1124
01:13:41,116 --> 01:13:43,380
and all I see is a fucking bull...

1125
01:13:43,452 --> 01:13:45,443
coming down
with a bottle of aspirin.

1126
01:13:45,521 --> 01:13:48,115
It was a big joke on both of us.

1127
01:13:48,190 --> 01:13:49,589
He didn't know about it?

1128
01:13:49,658 --> 01:13:50,625
No, he didn't.

1129
01:13:50,692 --> 01:13:52,751
And you never gave him
the chance, did you?

1130
01:13:52,828 --> 01:13:55,092
You just wanted
to watch somebody die.

1131
01:13:55,164 --> 01:13:57,132
I wanted to watch anybody die.

1132
01:13:59,334 --> 01:14:01,928
But he wasn't like them.
He... he was different.

1133
01:14:02,004 --> 01:14:04,598
But that didn't matter to you, did it?

1134
01:14:04,673 --> 01:14:06,937
You just drove it in deeper,
didn't you?

1135
01:14:07,009 --> 01:14:07,976
Of course it mattered.

1136
01:14:08,043 --> 01:14:09,977
I did everything I could to stop it.

1137
01:14:10,045 --> 01:14:12,513
He was holding on to me
like I could save him.

1138
01:14:12,581 --> 01:14:15,482
I put my hand over his throat
to try and stop the bleeding.

1139
01:14:15,551 --> 01:14:16,483
I gave him mouth-to-mouth...

1140
01:14:16,552 --> 01:14:17,484
to give him air.

1141
01:14:17,553 --> 01:14:18,520
You fucking liar!

1142
01:14:18,587 --> 01:14:19,576
It's the truth!

1143
01:14:19,655 --> 01:14:21,418
You don't think I got feelings?

1144
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:22,684
I got feelings, man.

1145
01:14:22,758 --> 01:14:24,248
If I could turn time back...

1146
01:14:24,326 --> 01:14:26,920
I would let that boy just walk by...

1147
01:14:26,995 --> 01:14:28,121
but I can't.

1148
01:14:28,197 --> 01:14:30,461
I see that boy's face every night...

1149
01:14:30,532 --> 01:14:33,797
his eyes, the way
he was looking up at me...

1150
01:14:33,869 --> 01:14:36,064
holding on.

1151
01:14:36,138 --> 01:14:38,072
You got no idea, man.

1152
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:41,473
No, I don't.

1153
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:45,109
Don't kid yourself.

1154
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:47,842
I know
you're holding on to shit, too.

1155
01:14:48,951 --> 01:14:51,317
It's time to get you
back to the cell.

1156
01:14:51,386 --> 01:14:52,751
Move over towards the gate.

1157
01:14:59,394 --> 01:15:01,726
Step out. Move against the wall.

1158
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,092
You guys from the outside...

1159
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:08,762
you know,
you really make me fucking laugh.

1160
01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:10,099
You come in here.

1161
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:12,436
You read my file and my jacket.

1162
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:16,137
You know every crime
I've ever committed, every sin...

1163
01:15:16,211 --> 01:15:17,838
but you don't know me.

1164
01:15:19,381 --> 01:15:21,349
You don't know me at all.

1165
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:26,844
Why don't you tell me
why you're not a cop?

1166
01:15:27,956 --> 01:15:30,925
Yeah, well, I wounded a guy
in a shooting.

1167
01:15:32,461 --> 01:15:34,929
Unnecessary use of deadly force.

1168
01:15:34,997 --> 01:15:36,931
I had to quit the force.

1169
01:15:36,999 --> 01:15:37,931
That's it?

1170
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,399
That's it?

1171
01:15:39,468 --> 01:15:42,335
I lost the job that I loved.

1172
01:15:42,404 --> 01:15:44,702
It's like losing a part of yourself.

1173
01:15:49,611 --> 01:15:52,842
No. You're holding on
to something else.

1174
01:15:54,116 --> 01:15:56,277
Stand against the wall.

1175
01:16:13,535 --> 01:16:14,467
You look great.

1176
01:16:14,536 --> 01:16:18,802
Thanks. My sister's down from Alden,
and we're gonna go out to dinner...

1177
01:16:18,874 --> 01:16:23,334
you know, maybe a movie.
There's some cold cuts in the refrigerator...

1178
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:26,677
and you guys can make yourselves
some sandwiches or something.

1179
01:16:26,748 --> 01:16:29,148
Can we talk later when you get back?

1180
01:16:29,217 --> 01:16:31,344
What are we gonna talk about?

1181
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:33,547
How things are gonna change
around here?

1182
01:16:33,622 --> 01:16:37,353
Look, I know I used those words
so much I broke 'em...

1183
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:40,190
but I'm telling you
it's gonna get better, Hope.

1184
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:41,229
It really is.

1185
01:16:42,297 --> 01:16:43,594
Hope!

1186
01:16:43,665 --> 01:16:45,326
Look at you!

1187
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:46,526
Aren't you something?

1188
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:49,537
Girl, I'm just dressed up for once.

1189
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:55,410
I'll see you later.

1190
01:16:55,477 --> 01:16:56,808
Yeah.

1191
01:17:56,204 --> 01:17:57,501
Hey, buddy.

1192
01:17:57,572 --> 01:18:00,040
What are you doing?

1193
01:18:00,108 --> 01:18:01,075
Making some stew.

1194
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:05,271
You talk to your teacher...

1195
01:18:05,347 --> 01:18:07,941
about that boy
who was messing with you?

1196
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:09,984
I'm just staying away from him.

1197
01:18:14,589 --> 01:18:16,216
I don't like cloves, dad.

1198
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:20,452
There are cloves in there?

1199
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:21,461
Yeah.

1200
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:24,499
Who put these cloves in here?

1201
01:18:24,566 --> 01:18:26,466
Get out.

1202
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:28,628
Back. Exit.

1203
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:30,934
Back to where you belong.

1204
01:18:58,967 --> 01:19:00,229
Real stupid move, Fred.

1205
01:19:00,302 --> 01:19:02,167
Did what I had to do, Lieutenant.

1206
01:19:02,237 --> 01:19:04,637
Invite you to my home.
Tried to be your friend.

1207
01:19:04,706 --> 01:19:06,571
You sure know how to burn bridges.

1208
01:19:06,641 --> 01:19:08,438
Administration won't let me
can your ass...

1209
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:10,034
until this complaint
has played through...

1210
01:19:10,112 --> 01:19:13,240
but you should know
I put a transfer in for you yesterday.

1211
01:19:13,315 --> 01:19:15,749
You're on the yard.
Get your papers tomorrow.

1212
01:19:15,817 --> 01:19:17,307
Unless you withdraw that complaint.

1213
01:19:17,385 --> 01:19:18,613
It's not gonna happen.

1214
01:19:18,687 --> 01:19:21,349
You were hung out to dry.
I gave you a job...

1215
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:24,085
I put food on your table,
and you rolled me over.

1216
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:25,854
Gotta go to work.

1217
01:19:27,295 --> 01:19:29,991
Hey! I got news for you.

1218
01:19:30,065 --> 01:19:31,498
Denver's gonna fry.

1219
01:19:31,566 --> 01:19:33,193
His petition was denied.

1220
01:19:37,906 --> 01:19:42,775
Inmate Julio Perez, 9-3-8.

1221
01:19:50,852 --> 01:19:52,444
Here's some food for you.

1222
01:19:52,521 --> 01:19:54,216
Hey, man.

1223
01:19:54,289 --> 01:19:56,985
I heard you dropped
a note on Lionel.

1224
01:19:57,058 --> 01:19:58,116
Yeah.

1225
01:19:58,193 --> 01:20:00,855
Good for you, Fred.
Good for you.

1226
01:20:02,197 --> 01:20:03,892
It's OK if I call you Fred?

1227
01:20:03,965 --> 01:20:06,729
Oh, yeah. It's OK to call me Fred.

1228
01:20:13,675 --> 01:20:15,802
Did you hear about my date?

1229
01:20:17,312 --> 01:20:19,143
Governor might grant you clemency.

1230
01:20:19,214 --> 01:20:23,344
Heh. Yeah, my ass
might sprout wings and fly.

1231
01:20:23,418 --> 01:20:25,386
I got something for you, man.

1232
01:20:27,722 --> 01:20:29,349
Where the fuck is it?

1233
01:20:31,092 --> 01:20:32,150
Come on.

1234
01:20:35,697 --> 01:20:38,632
You know, I live
in this small fucking place...

1235
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:40,292
and I keep losing everything.

1236
01:20:40,368 --> 01:20:43,303
I can't find half
my papers, my good pens...

1237
01:20:43,371 --> 01:20:44,804
where the fuck...

1238
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:48,142
Shit.

1239
01:20:51,112 --> 01:20:52,170
Thanks.

1240
01:20:52,247 --> 01:20:53,214
Yeah.

1241
01:20:55,217 --> 01:20:57,515
You think I'm gonna crack, don't you?

1242
01:20:58,887 --> 01:21:00,912
Nah, man.

1243
01:21:00,989 --> 01:21:02,752
I think you'll be all right.

1244
01:21:02,824 --> 01:21:04,689
I'm gonna be OK.

1245
01:21:07,629 --> 01:21:08,561
Fuck. Shit.

1246
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:10,325
Uh, you need some help in there?

1247
01:21:10,398 --> 01:21:12,593
No, man, I'm fine, OK?
Just let me do it.

1248
01:21:12,667 --> 01:21:14,191
You sure you don't need some help?

1249
01:21:14,269 --> 01:21:16,794
I'm fine, God damn it!
Leave me the fuck alone!

1250
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:17,804
Please.

1251
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:19,363
All right.

1252
01:21:23,078 --> 01:21:24,409
All right.

1253
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:25,878
Shit.

1254
01:21:28,650 --> 01:21:29,981
It's cool.

1255
01:21:30,051 --> 01:21:31,382
It's cool.

1256
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:33,910
Oh, motherfucker.

1257
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:13,093
Hi.

1258
01:22:22,003 --> 01:22:24,972
God, that feels good.

1259
01:22:26,374 --> 01:22:27,966
I heard on the news...

1260
01:22:28,043 --> 01:22:30,341
that there's gonna be an execution.

1261
01:22:30,412 --> 01:22:32,073
Is it that guy?

1262
01:22:32,147 --> 01:22:33,808
Yeah.

1263
01:22:33,882 --> 01:22:36,510
You won't have to be there, will you?

1264
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:40,812
Wanna be there.

1265
01:22:40,889 --> 01:22:42,322
Oh, Fred.

1266
01:22:42,390 --> 01:22:44,950
Why put yourself through that?

1267
01:22:46,361 --> 01:22:48,192
Because he's got nobody else.

1268
01:22:48,263 --> 01:22:51,096
Because I...

1269
01:22:53,935 --> 01:22:56,870
So where you been
the last couple of weeks?

1270
01:22:56,938 --> 01:22:59,771
I've been here, Fred.

1271
01:22:59,841 --> 01:23:01,331
Really?

1272
01:23:05,914 --> 01:23:08,212
I just want you to know that...

1273
01:23:10,552 --> 01:23:11,849
I do love you.

1274
01:23:15,190 --> 01:23:17,624
I love you, too.

1275
01:23:17,692 --> 01:23:20,855
But we're still left with these lives...

1276
01:23:20,929 --> 01:23:24,092
with the things
that we've said and done.

1277
01:23:24,165 --> 01:23:26,793
Some of them
are pretty hard to forget.

1278
01:23:30,205 --> 01:23:31,729
I'm sorry for that.

1279
01:23:36,077 --> 01:23:39,911
What is it, Hope?
What is it? What?

1280
01:23:39,981 --> 01:23:43,246
I feel like the past
has become this...

1281
01:23:43,318 --> 01:23:45,445
living thing, like this...

1282
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:48,546
shadow person
that's always standing there...

1283
01:23:48,623 --> 01:23:50,181
always between us...

1284
01:23:50,258 --> 01:23:52,522
messing with the things
that we say...

1285
01:23:52,594 --> 01:23:55,563
twisting our words,
and I don't know...

1286
01:23:55,630 --> 01:23:58,690
if "I'm sorry" is enough, Fred...

1287
01:23:58,767 --> 01:24:00,394
not for either of us.

1288
01:24:31,533 --> 01:24:32,830
Your lawyer's here.

1289
01:24:34,569 --> 01:24:36,059
You tell me.

1290
01:24:36,137 --> 01:24:37,434
He should be the one to tell you.

1291
01:24:37,505 --> 01:24:38,437
That's not my job.

1292
01:24:38,506 --> 01:24:39,473
Come on.

1293
01:24:41,142 --> 01:24:44,202
Governor denied
your application for clemency.

1294
01:24:48,416 --> 01:24:50,008
Tell him to go home.

1295
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:51,017
You sure?

1296
01:24:51,086 --> 01:24:53,077
He can't do me any good now.

1297
01:24:53,154 --> 01:24:54,849
He doesn't need to see me.

1298
01:24:54,923 --> 01:24:56,356
I'm doing him a favor.

1299
01:24:56,424 --> 01:24:57,356
OK.

1300
01:24:57,425 --> 01:24:58,892
Wait.

1301
01:25:01,529 --> 01:25:03,588
What time are you coming
to get me?

1302
01:25:03,665 --> 01:25:06,759
4:30. Gonna take you
to a cell in north block.

1303
01:25:06,835 --> 01:25:10,236
Heh. Great.

1304
01:25:10,305 --> 01:25:13,240
So I can sleep right next to the chair.

1305
01:25:13,308 --> 01:25:15,606
When's my wake-up call?

1306
01:25:15,677 --> 01:25:16,939
10:00 in the morning.

1307
01:25:17,011 --> 01:25:18,239
Man.

1308
01:25:22,584 --> 01:25:24,449
Have you got a cigarette?

1309
01:25:35,730 --> 01:25:37,891
Need anything?

1310
01:25:39,701 --> 01:25:42,135
You mean like a last wish?

1311
01:25:43,204 --> 01:25:45,229
Yeah, I guess so.

1312
01:25:52,847 --> 01:25:54,644
I, uh...

1313
01:25:56,918 --> 01:26:00,786
I need someone to hold, Fred.

1314
01:26:26,614 --> 01:26:27,646
If this complaint
goes to the hearing committee...

1315
01:26:27,681 --> 01:26:28,679
If this complaint
goes to the hearing committee...

1316
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:29,978
you won't have the ruling...

1317
01:26:30,051 --> 01:26:31,848
until after Denver Bayliss
has been executed.

1318
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:33,888
Are you sure you still wanna file?

1319
01:26:33,955 --> 01:26:34,887
Yes, sir.

1320
01:26:34,956 --> 01:26:36,355
Then I'll have to honor...

1321
01:26:36,424 --> 01:26:38,688
your commanding officer's
request for your transfer.

1322
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:41,456
We can't have personal conflict
in our housing unit...

1323
01:26:41,529 --> 01:26:43,554
the job of custody is difficult enough.

1324
01:26:43,631 --> 01:26:45,098
So I'm the one who's gotta go?

1325
01:26:45,166 --> 01:26:46,258
We're not talking dismissal here...

1326
01:26:46,334 --> 01:26:48,165
just a transfer to, uh...

1327
01:26:48,236 --> 01:26:49,430
to the yard.

1328
01:26:50,738 --> 01:26:55,334
Mr. Adams, could you delay my transfer
until after the Bayliss execution?

1329
01:26:55,410 --> 01:26:58,379
I promise I'll stay out
of the Lieutenant's way.

1330
01:26:58,446 --> 01:27:00,710
If you're worried
about Bayliss' well-being, don't.

1331
01:27:00,782 --> 01:27:02,613
I just think that things will go...

1332
01:27:02,684 --> 01:27:05,152
a lot more smoothly
if I'm still around.

1333
01:27:06,688 --> 01:27:07,882
All right.

1334
01:27:07,956 --> 01:27:09,856
I'll hold the paperwork.

1335
01:27:09,924 --> 01:27:12,085
That way, you can finish the job.

1336
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:13,320
Thank you.

1337
01:27:16,731 --> 01:27:18,961
Darrel, I won't be coming home tonight.

1338
01:27:19,033 --> 01:27:20,933
I gotta stay at the prison.

1339
01:27:21,002 --> 01:27:21,969
Why, dad?

1340
01:27:23,438 --> 01:27:25,929
'Cause...

1341
01:27:26,007 --> 01:27:28,407
state's gonna execute
a guy tomorrow morning...

1342
01:27:28,476 --> 01:27:30,068
and somebody's gotta be there...

1343
01:27:30,144 --> 01:27:32,112
to keep him company.

1344
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:33,875
Because he's scared?

1345
01:27:33,948 --> 01:27:35,848
Yeah. Yeah.

1346
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:41,184
Maybe he'll try
to kill himself tonight.

1347
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:43,554
Yeah. That's why I gotta be there.

1348
01:27:45,493 --> 01:27:48,087
If they're gonna kill him
the next day...

1349
01:27:48,162 --> 01:27:50,892
why do they care
if he kills himself?

1350
01:27:50,965 --> 01:27:53,195
I don't know.

1351
01:27:53,268 --> 01:27:56,237
I guess they wanna show
they got the power.

1352
01:27:58,006 --> 01:28:00,634
You care about this guy,
don't you, dad?

1353
01:28:01,709 --> 01:28:03,074
Yeah.

1354
01:28:04,712 --> 01:28:06,009
I care about him.

1355
01:28:26,034 --> 01:28:27,968
If anybody finds out about it...

1356
01:28:28,036 --> 01:28:30,334
I had nothing to do with it.

1357
01:29:06,007 --> 01:29:09,374
Denver Bayliss ate his last meal
at 6:00 this evening.

1358
01:29:09,444 --> 01:29:14,108
It consisted of Salisbury steak,
potatoes, and peas.

1359
01:29:14,182 --> 01:29:18,141
We believe he's resigned himself
to the sentence.

1360
01:29:18,219 --> 01:29:19,709
There were no visitors.

1361
01:29:19,787 --> 01:29:21,948
He did not request a prison chaplain.

1362
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:24,890
The execution is to proceed
as scheduled.

1363
01:29:24,959 --> 01:29:26,187
Everything is going smoothly...

1364
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:29,161
and we have no further comment
at this time.

1365
01:29:36,771 --> 01:29:39,365
Aw, man, I gotta get some more coffee.

1366
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:41,465
- Want a refill?
- No.

1367
01:29:41,542 --> 01:29:43,737
You don't mind
if I take a break, do you?

1368
01:29:43,811 --> 01:29:45,938
- No. Go ahead.
- All right. Thanks.

1369
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:02,156
What time is it, Fred?

1370
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:04,221
It's almost 3:00. You all right?

1371
01:30:05,366 --> 01:30:06,424
- Yeah.
- OK.

1372
01:30:12,039 --> 01:30:15,975
You can tell me that thing
you've been wanting to tell me.

1373
01:30:16,043 --> 01:30:17,908
- You know.
- What thing?

1374
01:30:17,979 --> 01:30:19,947
Whatever's been weighing on you.

1375
01:30:22,016 --> 01:30:23,677
Who's Virgil?

1376
01:30:23,751 --> 01:30:26,151
He was my father.

1377
01:30:26,220 --> 01:30:28,711
What'd he do? Did he hurt you?

1378
01:30:28,790 --> 01:30:31,418
He used to beat up on people...

1379
01:30:31,492 --> 01:30:33,585
whoever got in his way...

1380
01:30:33,661 --> 01:30:35,322
which... mostly us.

1381
01:30:35,396 --> 01:30:37,455
Who's "us"?

1382
01:30:37,532 --> 01:30:39,966
Me...

1383
01:30:40,034 --> 01:30:43,299
my mother, my little brother Tim.

1384
01:30:46,073 --> 01:30:49,167
He loved us. He did.

1385
01:30:49,243 --> 01:30:50,972
What happened?

1386
01:30:52,814 --> 01:30:56,614
I used to watch him beat up
my little brother Tim.

1387
01:30:56,684 --> 01:30:58,276
He always got the worst...

1388
01:30:58,352 --> 01:31:01,048
'cause he talked so much, you know?

1389
01:31:01,122 --> 01:31:02,248
Even when I was bigger...

1390
01:31:02,323 --> 01:31:03,950
I'd just watch him beat on Tim...

1391
01:31:04,025 --> 01:31:07,654
didn't do a Goddamn thing about it.

1392
01:31:09,230 --> 01:31:11,061
I was too scared.

1393
01:31:11,132 --> 01:31:13,327
I was scared, too.

1394
01:31:14,669 --> 01:31:17,365
When I got older...

1395
01:31:17,438 --> 01:31:20,601
me and Virgil sort of became friends.

1396
01:31:20,675 --> 01:31:23,109
I mean, he wasn't a badass no more.

1397
01:31:23,177 --> 01:31:25,509
He was just a... a tired old man...

1398
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:26,569
just tinkering around...

1399
01:31:26,647 --> 01:31:29,548
with this old heap of junk
he had jacked up...

1400
01:31:29,617 --> 01:31:31,608
on cinder blocks in his front yard.

1401
01:31:32,687 --> 01:31:36,282
But after my mom left...

1402
01:31:37,859 --> 01:31:40,157
That old car was all he had.

1403
01:31:42,830 --> 01:31:44,695
I felt sorry for him.

1404
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,592
What happened?

1405
01:31:47,668 --> 01:31:51,297
Went over to his place
to borrow some tools.

1406
01:31:51,372 --> 01:31:54,341
He gave 'em to me...

1407
01:31:54,408 --> 01:31:56,069
along with some shit...

1408
01:31:56,143 --> 01:31:59,408
about how I better take care of 'em.

1409
01:32:01,582 --> 01:32:05,313
I mean, petty, petty shit.

1410
01:32:05,386 --> 01:32:07,877
L... I just couldn't take it.

1411
01:32:07,955 --> 01:32:10,446
So what'd you do?

1412
01:32:10,525 --> 01:32:12,152
You tuned him up?

1413
01:32:13,227 --> 01:32:15,787
I started smashing in
his car window...

1414
01:32:15,863 --> 01:32:17,160
with the toolbox.

1415
01:32:19,667 --> 01:32:21,532
He came at me...

1416
01:32:21,602 --> 01:32:24,571
and I hit him in the face.

1417
01:32:26,941 --> 01:32:28,806
And I couldn't stop.

1418
01:32:34,215 --> 01:32:36,809
And l... I knocked
what few teeth he had...

1419
01:32:36,884 --> 01:32:39,250
right... right down his throat.

1420
01:32:40,621 --> 01:32:43,613
He recovered in a couple of days.

1421
01:32:44,725 --> 01:32:47,216
Two weeks later, he was...

1422
01:32:47,295 --> 01:32:48,956
dead...

1423
01:32:49,030 --> 01:32:50,554
from a heart attack.

1424
01:32:59,941 --> 01:33:01,203
Fred.

I wanna thank you.

1427
01:33:07,381 --> 01:33:08,973
For what?

1428
01:33:09,050 --> 01:33:11,348
For being my friend.

1429
01:33:18,759 --> 01:33:20,056
Good-bye.

1430
01:33:23,965 --> 01:33:25,159
Good-bye.

1431
01:34:05,940 --> 01:34:07,373
Denver Bayliss...

1432
01:34:07,441 --> 01:34:10,205
"Having been tried and convicted

"by means of electrocution

1439
01:34:30,398 --> 01:34:31,729
Stand up.

1440
