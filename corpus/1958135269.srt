1
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:12,205
Rourke?

2
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:19,179
Rourke.

3
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:24,384
Come back to us.

4
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:30,056
Sorry.

5
00:01:30,058 --> 00:01:31,793
Drifted off for a second.

6
00:01:33,595 --> 00:01:34,860
The park?

7
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:40,100
What about it?

8
00:01:41,903 --> 00:01:43,337
That's where you drift to,
isn't it?

9
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:46,206
That park.

10
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:48,543
That day.

11
00:01:50,712 --> 00:01:52,145
Take me back there.

12
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:56,149
What do you see?

13
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:06,358
<i>Dad.</i>

14
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,629
Fix my braid.

15
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:10,464
<i>Her hair.</i>

16
00:02:11,766 --> 00:02:13,264
I see her hair.

17
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:14,636
Your daughter?

18
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:17,803
Minnie.

19
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:20,205
This is not a braid.

20
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:21,373
This is a maze...

21
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:24,476
that only your mother can solve.

22
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:25,377
There you go.

23
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:26,914
Thank you, Dad!

24
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:33,218
<i>She was playing this game,</i>

25
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,419
<i>where she would see</i>

26
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:36,522
<i>how many times she could</i>
<i>spin around in one place</i>

27
00:02:36,524 --> 00:02:37,859
<i>before she fell over.</i>

28
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:40,862
When did you see him?

29
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:47,702
<i>I barely noticed him.</i>

30
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:51,673
<i>I was just happy</i>
<i>to be with my daughter.</i>

31
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,711
<i>I wasn't paying attention</i>
<i>for just...</i>

32
00:02:58,713 --> 00:03:00,347
<i>just for a second...</i>

33
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:03,518
...and I turned around...

34
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,354
<i>...and I didn't see her...</i>

35
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:10,424
<i>...and I got up...</i>

36
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:13,061
<i>...and I called out for her...</i>

37
00:03:16,898 --> 00:03:18,396
...and I looked for her,

38
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:19,701
and I c-- I c--

39
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:27,875
She was gone.

40
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:35,516
Rourke?

41
00:03:38,553 --> 00:03:39,787
I was there.

42
00:03:43,591 --> 00:03:44,759
There was nothing you could do.

43
00:03:57,038 --> 00:03:57,970
Work?

44
00:03:57,972 --> 00:03:59,572
Uh...

45
00:03:59,574 --> 00:04:01,406
That depends on you, I guess.

46
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,878
Uh, if you think
I'm ready for duty.

47
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,414
Do you feel ready,
emotionally?

48
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:11,919
I think it's the only thing
keeping me sane.

49
00:04:57,031 --> 00:04:59,565
<i>Though the missing child</i>

What, you lose something,
compadre?

60
00:05:36,838 --> 00:05:38,436
Cockroach.

61
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:39,839
Yeah. It's a hot day.

62
00:05:39,841 --> 00:05:40,908
Damn things are everywhere.

63
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:43,811
Hey, did you wipe your shoes?

64
00:05:54,989 --> 00:05:56,387
So how did it go in there?

65
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:57,422
You good?

66
00:05:57,424 --> 00:05:58,324
Yeah. No problem.

67
00:05:58,326 --> 00:06:00,159
I'm all clear for duty.
What's the call?

68
00:06:00,161 --> 00:06:02,561
Oh, it's a fun one.

69
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:04,096
Anonymous tip
came into dispatch.

70
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:05,132
Blocked number.

71
00:06:07,001 --> 00:06:08,667
<i>I'm calling to report a robbery.</i>

72
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:10,769
<i>Are you in a safe location?</i>

73
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:11,737
<i>Nobody's safe.</i>

74
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:13,105
Nice line.

75
00:06:13,107 --> 00:06:14,874
Just wait.

76
00:06:14,876 --> 00:06:16,976
<i>Is this crime</i>
<i>currently in progress?</i>

77
00:06:16,978 --> 00:06:18,744
<i>Today, the Bank of Austin.</i>

78
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:20,846
<i>There's a safe-deposit box.</i>

79
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:22,715
<i>Box 23.</i>

80
00:06:22,717 --> 00:06:24,118
<i>Box 2-3.</i>
<i>Is that the target?</i>

81
00:06:25,887 --> 00:06:26,986
<i>Hello?</i>

82
00:06:26,988 --> 00:06:27,887
Flair for drama.

83
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:29,822
You're thinking it's a prank.
I get it.

84
00:06:29,824 --> 00:06:30,856
That's what I thought, too.

85
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:32,791
Except?

86
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:34,193
Two armed robberies this week

87
00:06:34,195 --> 00:06:35,561
at Bank of Austin

88
00:06:35,563 --> 00:06:37,464
at branches
Houston and Amarillo.

89
00:06:38,633 --> 00:06:40,833
Both inside jobs
involving people with access.

90
00:06:40,835 --> 00:06:42,534
Both hit the safe-deposit boxes,

91
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:44,036
but take only one box

92
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:46,138
and no money at all.

93
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,973
No shit?

94
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:49,043
Captain put us on stakeout.

95
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:09,496
Getting audio.

96
00:07:11,132 --> 00:07:12,497
<i>A guy goes up</i>
<i>to the bartender,</i>

97
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:13,799
<i>and he says,</i>

98
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:15,466
<i>"Hey, bartender.</i>
<i>I got me a bet for you.</i>

99
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:17,670
<i>"I'm going to bet you</i>
<i>300 bucks</i>

100
00:07:17,672 --> 00:07:19,972
<i>that I can piss into</i>
<i>that glass over there,</i>

101
00:07:19,974 --> 00:07:21,006
<i>and not spill..."</i>

102
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:22,174
All right, come on.
Move on.

103
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:24,475
-Wait. This is a good one.
- <i>The bartender looks...</i>

104
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:25,811
-I don't know, it.
-Hey! I said, move on.

105
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:26,781
<i>...piss into, something like--</i>

106
00:07:31,152 --> 00:07:33,052
He pisses on the bartender.

107
00:07:33,054 --> 00:07:34,787
-No kidding.
-It's a whole thing.

108
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:35,990
Yeah, it's a good one.

109
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:44,799
See that guy on the bench?

110
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:49,134
He looks familiar.

111
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,736
<i>No. No.</i>

112
00:07:50,738 --> 00:07:51,737
<i>The city contracts.</i>

113
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:53,272
You know this guy?

114
00:07:53,274 --> 00:07:54,940
- <i>Thanks.</i>
- Not sure.

115
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:55,876
<i>Do you have a lighter?</i>

116
00:07:58,813 --> 00:08:00,045
Quite masculine.

117
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:01,246
Is it yours?

118
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:02,881
My husband gave it to me.

119
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:03,851
I don't smoke.

120
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:07,286
He's got you
under his spell, doesn't he?

121
00:08:07,288 --> 00:08:08,656
Yes, he does.

122
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:13,060
It's very hot today.

123
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:16,731
<i>I didn't notice.</i>

124
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:19,633
Trust me, it's like a furnace.

125
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:25,804
Great. We got the weather.

126
00:08:25,806 --> 00:08:27,039
Can we move on now?

127
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:27,973
That guy's up to something.

128
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:29,210
Zoom in.

129
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,016
<i>It's a sunny day.</i>

130
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,950
You see that?

131
00:08:37,952 --> 00:08:39,086
He's speaking in code.

132
00:08:40,855 --> 00:08:42,156
The guards are in on it.

133
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:44,859
Hey! Rourke! Wait!

134
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:49,864
So hot.

135
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:55,100
He's going for the bank.

136
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:56,637
Don't walk into
that bank, Rourke.

137
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:58,839
<i>We don't know</i>
<i>if that's the guy.</i>

138
00:09:00,608 --> 00:09:01,942
It's like a furnace.

139
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:05,944
<i>Watch the woman.</i>

140
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:07,212
I'll send back-up.

141
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,714
Do not follow.

142
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:09,784
<i>Yeah, roger that.</i>

143
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:19,293
Danny, get out of that bank.

144
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:22,194
Can I help you, sir?

145
00:09:22,196 --> 00:09:23,862
<i>I repeat, do not break--</i>

146
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:30,869
You know I'd like to open
a safe-deposit box.

147
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:31,939
<i>Right this way.</i>

148
00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:38,977
It's so hot.

149
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:40,147
It's like a furnace.

150
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:01,867
If you just fill this out,

151
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:03,104
we'll get you set right up.

152
00:10:04,338 --> 00:10:06,105
Shoot. Excuse me.

153
00:10:06,107 --> 00:10:07,773
I must have left
my keys in my office.

154
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:08,774
I'll be right back.

155
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:09,810
Thank you.

156
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,318
Here you go.
Have a great day.

157
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:22,923
Good morning, sir.

158
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,390
Morning?

159
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:26,393
It's late afternoon.

160
00:10:31,232 --> 00:10:32,833
It is late afternoon.

161
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,121
Minnie.

162
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:18,279
Stop. Police.

163
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:21,916
Stop.

164
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:27,019
I said, stop where you are.

165
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:28,055
Stop!

166
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:05,226
Oh, shit!

167
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:46,398
-Rourke!
-Send back-up!

168
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,935
Go. Go!

169
00:13:13,528 --> 00:13:14,495
Do you mind?

170
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:31,045
Stop!

171
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:47,092
Hands up, asshole!

172
00:13:47,094 --> 00:13:48,228
Don't move!

173
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:50,898
Cuff him.

174
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:01,308
What are you waiting for?
Cuff him.

175
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:03,410
But I'm the wrong man.

176
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:10,315
He's the wrong man.

177
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:11,352
What?

178
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:15,420
You crooked bastards.
Who do you work for?

179
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:17,557
Don't blame them, Detective.

180
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:19,592
They're no more
conscious of themselves

181
00:14:19,594 --> 00:14:22,196
than Lyle Terry was.

182
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:27,502
That was his name, wasn't it?

183
00:14:29,136 --> 00:14:31,872
The pawn who took your queen.

184
00:14:32,674 --> 00:14:34,041
Where is she?

185
00:14:40,481 --> 00:14:41,616
Give that to me.

186
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:44,584
Where is she?
What does it mean?

187
00:14:44,586 --> 00:14:45,486
Who's Lev Dellrayne?

188
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:48,288
What the hell?

189
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,092
Clean this up, detectives.

190
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:57,931
No!

191
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:19,186
Nobody saw him flee the scene?

192
00:15:20,354 --> 00:15:21,987
We put out an APB.
Still nothing.

193
00:15:21,989 --> 00:15:24,022
The guards? Crew?

194
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:25,525
Teller woman?
Anything?

195
00:15:25,527 --> 00:15:26,626
The ones that survive

196
00:15:26,628 --> 00:15:29,595
claim they can't
remember anything.

197
00:15:29,597 --> 00:15:30,530
Just like Lyle Terry.

198
00:15:30,532 --> 00:15:31,463
Danny.

199
00:15:31,465 --> 00:15:32,600
He said his name, Nicks.

200
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:35,701
He had this picture
of my daughter

201
00:15:35,703 --> 00:15:37,537
in a safe-deposit box.

202
00:15:37,539 --> 00:15:39,006
You want to explain that to me?

203
00:15:40,174 --> 00:15:41,308
All right. That story
was all over the news.

204
00:15:42,476 --> 00:15:44,278
A cop's kid gets abducted.

205
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,045
For all we know,
this is some sick joke.

206
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:49,749
Someone messing with you,
messing with us.

207
00:15:49,751 --> 00:15:51,717
Hell, our own guys
were in on this one.

208
00:15:51,719 --> 00:15:54,419
I saw the way he looked at me.

209
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:55,456
He knows.

210
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:58,457
He knows where my daughter is.

211
00:15:58,459 --> 00:15:59,426
I'm sure of it.

212
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:05,265
All right.

213
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,268
How do we catch the bastard?

214
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:43,769
Hey. What's up?

215
00:16:43,771 --> 00:16:45,805
Promise me I'm not an idiot
for trusting you.

216
00:16:45,807 --> 00:16:47,640
What do you got?

217
00:16:47,642 --> 00:16:50,442
That call that came in,
that tipped us to the bank?

218
00:16:50,444 --> 00:16:52,210
Blocked number, no I.D.?

219
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:53,746
Ran a trace.

220
00:16:53,748 --> 00:16:54,680
We got an address.

221
00:16:54,682 --> 00:16:56,081
Oh.

222
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,415
<i>A storefront out on Chapel.</i>

223
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:58,684
I shouldn't be
doing this, Rourke.

224
00:16:58,686 --> 00:17:00,285
<i>I haven't even</i>
<i>told the Cap yet.</i>

225
00:17:00,287 --> 00:17:01,589
Text it to me.
I'll be right there.

226
00:17:04,424 --> 00:17:06,826
<i>The call came from</i>
<i>the phone of Diana Cruz,</i>

227
00:17:06,828 --> 00:17:08,628
<i>a dime-store psychic</i>

228
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,796
<i>with a few arrests</i>
<i>for mail fraud.</i>

229
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:12,232
<i>No convictions.</i>

230
00:17:18,673 --> 00:17:20,673
You're in front of the house.

231
00:17:20,675 --> 00:17:22,810
You go up the steps.

232
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:27,212
You step through the door...

233
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:28,616
and you see her there.

234
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,151
She's holding
something in her arms.

235
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:35,320
It's a baby.

236
00:17:35,322 --> 00:17:36,456
She's holding you.

237
00:17:40,294 --> 00:17:41,495
I love you, Mama.

238
00:17:43,598 --> 00:17:44,864
I'm sorry.

239
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:50,536
Is it over?

240
00:17:50,538 --> 00:17:52,404
What happened?

241
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:54,107
We have company.

242
00:17:55,543 --> 00:17:56,576
Good evening, ma'am.

243
00:17:56,578 --> 00:17:57,577
Austin Police Department.

244
00:17:57,579 --> 00:17:58,778
I'd like to speak with you.

245
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,712
How can I help you, Officer?

246
00:17:59,714 --> 00:18:01,547
Detective, actually,

247
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:03,381
and, uh...

248
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:04,351
Hello.

249
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,319
This piggy bothering you, Di?

250
00:18:07,321 --> 00:18:09,287
It's cool, Tiny.

251
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:10,525
I can handle him.

252
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:13,561
I'll be outside.

253
00:18:19,867 --> 00:18:21,234
I'll just take
a few minutes of your time.

254
00:18:22,604 --> 00:18:24,169
Sure.

255
00:18:34,616 --> 00:18:37,351
He'll be out there on his bike
until you leave.

256
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:40,352
Oh. Loyal customer.

257
00:18:40,354 --> 00:18:42,287
I inspire that in people.

258
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:44,857
Detective Rourke, isn't it?

259
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:46,859
Well, that's
some impressive mind-reading.

260
00:18:46,861 --> 00:18:48,428
I just read the news.

261
00:18:49,597 --> 00:18:51,198
You're the one
who lost his kid.

262
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:54,432
Must have been awful.

263
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:58,504
If you're open to a session,
hypnosis can be therapeutic.

264
00:18:58,506 --> 00:18:59,705
Confronting the past.

265
00:18:59,707 --> 00:19:02,273
I'm interested in your past.

266
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:03,876
Diana Cruz,

267
00:19:03,878 --> 00:19:06,846
accused of bilking clients
in Laredo, San Antonio.

268
00:19:06,848 --> 00:19:08,681
Packed up shop
and moved down here.

269
00:19:08,683 --> 00:19:10,248
Those charges were lies.

270
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,250
I'm not bunko. Okay?

271
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:13,485
I'm not here to bust you.

272
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:14,887
I just want to know

273
00:19:14,889 --> 00:19:16,354
how a two-bit con artist
like you

274
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:18,258
got involved with Lev Dellrayne.

275
00:19:19,527 --> 00:19:21,228
I know you called the tip in
on the bank heist.

276
00:19:31,639 --> 00:19:32,738
Did you catch someone?

277
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,675
Not yet.
They got away.

278
00:19:34,976 --> 00:19:35,910
Then you need to leave.

279
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:38,410
Why don't you come
to the station with me?

280
00:19:38,412 --> 00:19:39,645
-Am I under arrest?
-No.

281
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,780
Then get out.

282
00:19:40,782 --> 00:19:43,281
-I can see you're afraid--
-Get the hell out of here.

283
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:44,517
You know what?

284
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:45,651
Why don't you tell me
what you're afraid of?

285
00:19:45,653 --> 00:19:47,653
You stay. I'm out.

286
00:19:47,655 --> 00:19:48,721
I can protect you.

287
00:19:48,723 --> 00:19:49,855
You don't know anything.

288
00:19:49,857 --> 00:19:51,391
I know I saw him at the bank.
Didn't I?

289
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,861
Lev Dellrayne.

290
00:20:03,938 --> 00:20:05,705
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

291
00:20:05,707 --> 00:20:07,305
Thank you.

292
00:20:07,307 --> 00:20:08,676
He was sent to kill us.

293
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:11,443
Who are you?

294
00:20:11,445 --> 00:20:12,379
Hey!

295
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:16,615
He won't tell you anything.

296
00:20:16,617 --> 00:20:18,586
I can be
pretty persuasive myself.

297
00:20:23,558 --> 00:20:24,924
He...

298
00:20:24,926 --> 00:20:26,391
won't...

299
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:27,528
stop.

300
00:20:50,618 --> 00:20:52,585
I didn't think
you were arresting me.

301
00:20:52,587 --> 00:20:53,953
I'm not.

302
00:20:53,955 --> 00:20:55,554
We use this
for storage nowadays.

303
00:20:55,556 --> 00:20:56,655
You'll be safe here.

304
00:20:56,657 --> 00:20:59,024
Nicks, run the vic's I.D..

305
00:20:59,026 --> 00:21:00,526
Look for past gang affiliations,

306
00:21:00,528 --> 00:21:01,560
former cellmates.

307
00:21:01,562 --> 00:21:03,562
There's got to be
some connection to Dellrayne.

308
00:21:03,564 --> 00:21:04,464
All we've got to do is find it.

309
00:21:10,004 --> 00:21:12,004
Let's keep her
out of it for now.

310
00:21:12,006 --> 00:21:14,039
The Captain
will be asking questions.

311
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:15,576
Tell her I'm working on it.

312
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:20,579
We're going to run priors
on your biker friend.

313
00:21:20,581 --> 00:21:22,548
Whatever connection he has
or link to Dellrayne,

314
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,616
I'm sure it will come up.

315
00:21:23,618 --> 00:21:24,917
You won't find anything.

316
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:26,919
You might be surprised.

317
00:21:26,921 --> 00:21:29,320
You think learning who he is
will tell you why he did it?

318
00:21:29,322 --> 00:21:30,825
What other motive is there?

319
00:21:32,794 --> 00:21:34,527
What makes four total strangers

320
00:21:34,529 --> 00:21:37,497
pull off an elaborate
bank heist on a whim?

321
00:21:39,867 --> 00:21:41,468
I'm guessing you're going
to say Lev Dellrayne.

322
00:21:42,637 --> 00:21:43,702
Why don't you tell me who he is?

323
00:21:43,704 --> 00:21:44,970
What does he have
on these people?

324
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:46,105
Are you familiar

325
00:21:46,107 --> 00:21:48,375
with the concept
of hypnotic constructs?

326
00:21:50,645 --> 00:21:52,878
Look, lady, come on.

327
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,114
First, it's, uh,
fortune telling.

328
00:21:55,116 --> 00:21:56,414
Now it's hypnosis.

329
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:57,919
-I--
-It's not hypnosis.

330
00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:00,653
Hypnotics have abilities

331
00:22:00,655 --> 00:22:02,621
far beyond anything
we have a name for.

332
00:22:02,623 --> 00:22:03,756
"Hypnotics"?

333
00:22:03,758 --> 00:22:05,558
People with the ability

334
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:09,128
to actually influence the brain
over a psychic bandwidth.

335
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:10,563
Like telepathy?

336
00:22:10,565 --> 00:22:12,363
Telepaths just read the mind.

337
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:14,401
Hypnotics reshape its reality.

338
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,468
The guy at the bank,

339
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:20,840
you said he spoke four words
to a woman and she undressed.

340
00:22:20,842 --> 00:22:22,808
Because she was in on it.

341
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:23,876
No.

342
00:22:23,878 --> 00:22:26,444
Those were cues--

343
00:22:26,446 --> 00:22:28,850
sound, voice, locking eyes.

344
00:22:29,951 --> 00:22:30,883
Hypnotics use them

345
00:22:30,885 --> 00:22:31,851
to make you see

346
00:22:31,853 --> 00:22:34,088
a version of the world
that doesn't exist.

347
00:22:35,556 --> 00:22:38,657
Your behavior conforms
with this hypnotic construct,

348
00:22:38,659 --> 00:22:41,126
so everything
that you see and do

349
00:22:41,128 --> 00:22:42,830
feels perfectly normal.

350
00:22:44,131 --> 00:22:46,968
How is it that you know
so much about these hypnotics?

351
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:50,736
Because I am one.

352
00:22:50,738 --> 00:22:51,706
Bullshit.

353
00:22:53,608 --> 00:22:54,640
A cynic.

354
00:22:54,642 --> 00:22:56,675
Mind control?

355
00:22:56,677 --> 00:22:59,044
Dream bank accounts?

356
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:00,112
Sounds more like my ex-wife.

357
00:23:00,114 --> 00:23:02,014
Take it easy, Nicks.

358
00:23:02,016 --> 00:23:04,583
We just watched two cops
blow each other's brains out,

359
00:23:04,585 --> 00:23:05,820
and she's saying
it's some Vegas act.

360
00:23:07,121 --> 00:23:08,022
She's playing us.

361
00:23:10,591 --> 00:23:11,659
Why don't you
have a seat, Nicks?

362
00:23:23,537 --> 00:23:24,672
You're a prisoner.

363
00:23:26,007 --> 00:23:27,474
Act like one.

364
00:23:33,981 --> 00:23:35,182
Nicks?

365
00:23:37,752 --> 00:23:39,486
Oh, God.

366
00:23:41,622 --> 00:23:42,590
Hey. Nicks!

367
00:23:43,658 --> 00:23:44,723
Let's cut the shit out.

368
00:23:44,725 --> 00:23:45,793
Stop that,
whatever you're doing.

369
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,162
Why don't you get some air?

370
00:23:52,733 --> 00:23:53,766
Hey, you know what?

371
00:23:53,768 --> 00:23:55,603
I could use some air.

372
00:23:59,907 --> 00:24:00,975
I'll be outside.

373
00:24:03,945 --> 00:24:05,711
Don't worry, Detective.

374
00:24:05,713 --> 00:24:06,847
I already tried it on you.

375
00:24:08,516 --> 00:24:09,684
It didn't work.

376
00:24:10,918 --> 00:24:11,919
Who the hell are you?

377
00:24:13,854 --> 00:24:15,955
Just get me some coffee.

378
00:24:15,957 --> 00:24:17,457
Maybe I'll tell you.

379
00:24:31,639 --> 00:24:32,873
Need a light?

380
00:24:41,782 --> 00:24:43,215
They were looking for people

381
00:24:43,217 --> 00:24:46,120
who thought they had
above-normal intuitive ability.

382
00:24:48,522 --> 00:24:50,923
I usually make some money
reading tarot.

383
00:24:50,925 --> 00:24:53,092
They were offering 50 bucks.

384
00:24:53,094 --> 00:24:55,096
I thought, "What the hell?"
and took the test.

385
00:24:57,298 --> 00:24:58,964
A week later,

386
00:24:58,966 --> 00:25:01,600
there were two suits
waiting in my dorm room.

387
00:25:01,602 --> 00:25:02,603
Feds?

388
00:25:04,171 --> 00:25:06,038
They said
I could finish my degree,

389
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,873
rack up more student debt,

390
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:08,974
or I could come with them

391
00:25:08,976 --> 00:25:10,743
and earn six figures
in six months.

392
00:25:10,745 --> 00:25:12,644
That's not a government salary.

393
00:25:12,646 --> 00:25:14,079
The Division started

394
00:25:14,081 --> 00:25:16,849
as a privately-run
U.S. government program,

395
00:25:16,851 --> 00:25:19,685
developing methods
to influence political outcomes.

396
00:25:19,687 --> 00:25:20,652
Defense contractor.

397
00:25:20,654 --> 00:25:22,254
Defense, offense,

398
00:25:22,256 --> 00:25:23,922
whatever needed doing.

399
00:25:23,924 --> 00:25:25,124
The Division advanced

400
00:25:25,126 --> 00:25:27,092
American interests
around the world,

401
00:25:27,094 --> 00:25:29,128
but then they discovered

402
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:30,765
the hypnotic ability
within humans...

403
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:34,333
...and that this ability
could be trained.

404
00:25:34,335 --> 00:25:36,268
Improved upon.

405
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:39,805
Hypnotics had a way
to get it done without receipts.

406
00:25:39,807 --> 00:25:40,775
What about Dellrayne?

407
00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:43,275
He was the legend.

408
00:25:43,277 --> 00:25:45,677
The most powerful hypnotic
ever trained.

409
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,681
All of us were amateurs
compared to him.

410
00:25:48,849 --> 00:25:50,082
But then he went rogue.

411
00:25:50,084 --> 00:25:51,283
Dellrayne believed

412
00:25:51,285 --> 00:25:54,286
that only he could realize
the hypnotic's true potential,

413
00:25:54,288 --> 00:25:56,257
and tried to take over
the Division.

414
00:25:57,892 --> 00:26:00,061
I was one of the agents
who stood in his way.

415
00:26:01,662 --> 00:26:02,928
Division locked him up.

416
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,930
I knew it wouldn't last.

417
00:26:04,932 --> 00:26:06,331
So I made it out.

418
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:07,332
Cut ties.

419
00:26:07,334 --> 00:26:09,101
Started fresh.

420
00:26:09,103 --> 00:26:10,169
Last week,

421
00:26:10,171 --> 00:26:12,204
when I read about the robberies,

422
00:26:12,206 --> 00:26:14,239
the other banks,

423
00:26:14,241 --> 00:26:16,675
and that no one
even remembered him,

424
00:26:16,677 --> 00:26:18,746
I knew that it was Dellrayne...

425
00:26:19,947 --> 00:26:21,013
...and I also knew

426
00:26:21,015 --> 00:26:23,315
that no one
who knows that he exists

427
00:26:23,317 --> 00:26:25,084
is safe.

428
00:26:25,086 --> 00:26:26,320
Especially you.

429
00:26:28,823 --> 00:26:30,389
He can't be caught.

430
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:36,363
Stay here.

431
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,177
Nicks?

432
00:26:52,379 --> 00:26:53,347
Nicks, it's me.

433
00:27:00,788 --> 00:27:01,922
Nicks?

434
00:27:03,124 --> 00:27:04,258
Put the gun down, Nicks.

435
00:27:06,026 --> 00:27:06,927
It's not him anymore.

436
00:27:08,262 --> 00:27:09,163
Do something.
Wake him up.

437
00:27:10,131 --> 00:27:12,164
Dellrayne is doing this.
I'm not strong enough.

438
00:27:12,166 --> 00:27:13,134
Nicks, put it down.

439
00:27:14,768 --> 00:27:16,137
Nicks, stop where you are!

440
00:27:19,273 --> 00:27:20,105
Nicks, stop or I'll shoot!

441
00:27:20,107 --> 00:27:21,406
Do it!

442
00:27:21,408 --> 00:27:22,741
Rourke!

443
00:27:28,349 --> 00:27:30,449
Okay, buddy.
Are you all right? It's me.

444
00:27:30,451 --> 00:27:31,917
You okay?
You all right?

445
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,318
You're all right.

446
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,421
I got you in the leg.
You're okay.

447
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:47,399
He won't stop

448
00:27:47,401 --> 00:27:49,770
until he accomplishes
what he's been told to do.

449
00:28:01,248 --> 00:28:03,017
Rourke, we need to go.

450
00:28:05,786 --> 00:28:06,921
Nicks.

451
00:28:08,222 --> 00:28:10,155
Stop, Nicks.
Stop. Nicks.

452
00:28:10,157 --> 00:28:11,091
Hey! Wake up!

453
00:28:12,393 --> 00:28:14,359
He's too far gone.

454
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:16,228
Nicks.

455
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,229
He'll kill us both.

456
00:28:17,231 --> 00:28:18,866
Nicks, this isn't you.

457
00:28:20,935 --> 00:28:21,969
Nicks!

458
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,772
-He'll pull his hand off!
-Nicks!

459
00:28:25,906 --> 00:28:26,941
Rourke!

460
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:29,374
Nicks!

461
00:28:44,992 --> 00:28:46,225
Put the gun down.

462
00:28:46,227 --> 00:28:47,859
Put it down!

463
00:28:50,464 --> 00:28:52,064
You killed him.

464
00:28:52,066 --> 00:28:53,367
He was already dead.

465
00:28:55,369 --> 00:28:56,737
He was already dead.

466
00:28:57,972 --> 00:28:59,006
I set him free.

467
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,116
Nicks?

468
00:29:11,118 --> 00:29:12,253
Nicks...

469
00:29:37,378 --> 00:29:38,511
<i>A veteran police detective,</i>

470
00:29:38,513 --> 00:29:39,646
<i>Daniel Rourke,</i>

471
00:29:39,648 --> 00:29:41,913
<i>is wanted with another suspect</i>
<i>seen here,</i>

472
00:29:41,915 --> 00:29:42,981
<i>in connection</i>

473
00:29:42,983 --> 00:29:44,816
<i>with the execution-style slaying</i>

474
00:29:44,818 --> 00:29:47,587
<i>of his former partner,</i>
<i>Randy Nicks.</i>

475
00:29:47,589 --> 00:29:49,888
<i>Police detective Daniel Rourke's</i>
<i>missing daughter...</i>

476
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:52,124
He had a wife.
Two kids.

477
00:29:52,126 --> 00:29:54,326
We had no choice.

478
00:29:54,328 --> 00:29:56,228
They think I killed him.

479
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,063
That's exactly
what Dellrayne wants.

480
00:29:58,065 --> 00:29:59,800
You don't know
who you're dealing with.

481
00:30:01,302 --> 00:30:02,870
I know he took my daughter.

482
00:30:05,139 --> 00:30:06,240
What do you mean?

483
00:30:13,347 --> 00:30:15,180
This was, uh...

484
00:30:15,182 --> 00:30:18,183
in the safe-deposit box
at the bank.

485
00:30:18,185 --> 00:30:19,554
It's what Dellrayne came for.

486
00:30:24,526 --> 00:30:26,026
You don't understand
what it's like.

487
00:30:30,197 --> 00:30:31,398
They never found her body.

488
00:30:39,907 --> 00:30:42,007
The guy they arrested...

489
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:43,944
swears he doesn't even remember
the kidnapping.

490
00:30:45,312 --> 00:30:46,480
I always thought he was lying.

491
00:30:50,417 --> 00:30:51,919
What if he was
telling the truth?

492
00:30:54,355 --> 00:30:56,223
What if my daughter's
still out there?

493
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:05,598
Morning, Luz.

494
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,599
Morning.

495
00:31:06,601 --> 00:31:09,368
Just give me a couple of them
breakfast tacos,

496
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:11,370
extra chorizo.

497
00:31:11,372 --> 00:31:12,371
Coffee?

498
00:31:12,373 --> 00:31:13,608
Black and sludgy.

499
00:31:33,494 --> 00:31:35,062
Call it in.

500
00:31:41,368 --> 00:31:42,570
You just saw us heading north.

501
00:31:46,006 --> 00:31:47,607
Dispatch.

502
00:31:47,609 --> 00:31:50,710
This is Tex DPS calling
to report two fugitives.

503
00:31:50,712 --> 00:31:52,377
Male and female

504
00:31:52,379 --> 00:31:55,715
heading north on I35
from Stonewall Trail.

505
00:31:55,717 --> 00:31:57,918
He'll get the check.

506
00:32:00,387 --> 00:32:01,556
Be generous.

507
00:32:02,557 --> 00:32:03,591
Luz?

508
00:32:05,426 --> 00:32:08,563
It's about time that I finally
gave you a decent tip.

509
00:32:10,063 --> 00:32:11,231
<i>This is dispatch.</i>

510
00:32:12,466 --> 00:32:15,235
<i>Two officers are arriving</i>
<i>at your location now.</i>

511
00:32:17,404 --> 00:32:18,673
<i>I found you, Diana.</i>

512
00:32:29,082 --> 00:32:30,050
Find us a way out of here.

513
00:32:31,185 --> 00:32:32,250
I have what he wants.

514
00:32:32,252 --> 00:32:33,553
-No.
-I'll distract him.

515
00:32:33,555 --> 00:32:35,454
Rourke! No!
He'll kill you!

516
00:32:35,456 --> 00:32:36,558
Rourke!

517
00:32:39,026 --> 00:32:39,993
Shit!

518
00:34:15,623 --> 00:34:16,591
Ready to go?

519
00:34:19,627 --> 00:34:20,695
Get out.

520
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:32,840
-That's a way out.
-Yeah.

521
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,681
A construct makes you see

522
00:34:41,683 --> 00:34:43,417
what the hypnotic
wants you to see.

523
00:34:44,586 --> 00:34:46,418
It can look like anything.

524
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:49,557
It's whatever makes you do
the behavior they want.

525
00:34:51,124 --> 00:34:52,725
But you're different.

526
00:34:52,727 --> 00:34:54,125
Why?

527
00:34:54,127 --> 00:34:55,160
You have a block, Detective.

528
00:34:55,162 --> 00:34:56,496
A psychic block.

529
00:34:57,632 --> 00:34:58,831
A hypnotic's worst nightmare.

530
00:34:58,833 --> 00:35:03,335
Everyone's subconscious mind
puts up a barrier to entry.

531
00:35:03,337 --> 00:35:04,503
For most people,

532
00:35:04,505 --> 00:35:06,304
it's a padlock,

533
00:35:06,306 --> 00:35:08,543
or a simple
one, two, three code.

534
00:35:09,711 --> 00:35:11,343
Yours...

535
00:35:11,345 --> 00:35:14,549
is locked inside a vault,
buried in a bunker 10 feet deep.

536
00:35:15,683 --> 00:35:17,382
I guess I'm lucky
I'm such a head case.

537
00:35:17,384 --> 00:35:19,652
Your block
could come from anywhere.

538
00:35:19,654 --> 00:35:21,386
Scar tissue.

539
00:35:21,388 --> 00:35:22,657
Emotional trauma.

540
00:35:23,858 --> 00:35:25,325
Your daughter maybe.

541
00:35:28,462 --> 00:35:30,130
Pain can keep the mind awake.

542
00:35:31,766 --> 00:35:33,532
But the bottom line is,

543
00:35:33,534 --> 00:35:35,266
I can't get to you...

544
00:35:35,268 --> 00:35:36,671
but Dellrayne can.

545
00:36:01,863 --> 00:36:03,497
Excuse me, Officer.

546
00:36:04,966 --> 00:36:06,400
Which way is Mexico?

547
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:17,510
Bet you've never gotten
a speeding ticket either.

548
00:36:17,512 --> 00:36:18,478
Nope.

549
00:36:30,892 --> 00:36:33,224
Jeremiah was my handler
in the Division,

550
00:36:33,226 --> 00:36:34,860
Southwest Station Chief.

551
00:36:34,862 --> 00:36:36,428
Strong hypnotic?

552
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:38,229
He's not one, actually.

553
00:36:38,231 --> 00:36:39,632
Just a mean old bastard

554
00:36:39,634 --> 00:36:40,866
with a psychic block

555
00:36:40,868 --> 00:36:42,935
that makes yours...

556
00:36:42,937 --> 00:36:44,603
look like
a childproof safety cap.

557
00:36:44,605 --> 00:36:46,806
So you can't influence him?

558
00:36:46,808 --> 00:36:49,340
Not for long
before he spots the gap.

559
00:36:49,342 --> 00:36:50,444
Only Dellrayne ever could.

560
00:36:51,879 --> 00:36:53,781
This guy can help us catch him.

561
00:36:55,449 --> 00:36:57,382
Is your gun loaded?

562
00:36:57,384 --> 00:36:58,351
I thought this guy liked you.

563
00:36:59,453 --> 00:37:00,820
He loved me like a daughter,

564
00:37:00,822 --> 00:37:02,922
but I didn't split
with the Division

565
00:37:02,924 --> 00:37:04,224
on the best of terms.

566
00:37:05,292 --> 00:37:06,527
I left him hogtied
in a bathtub.

567
00:37:07,729 --> 00:37:09,296
Got it.

568
00:37:23,978 --> 00:37:25,477
Maria, la puerta!

569
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:30,348
¿Quién es?

570
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:31,451
Stop, stop, stop.

571
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,688
Get back.

572
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:39,694
It's open.

573
00:37:41,629 --> 00:37:42,563
Hands up, jackass.

574
00:37:50,303 --> 00:37:51,672
¿Ahora quién es el pendejo?

575
00:37:54,509 --> 00:37:55,943
You sneaky bitch.

576
00:37:58,378 --> 00:37:59,547
You taught me well.

577
00:38:00,615 --> 00:38:02,681
Yes, I did.

578
00:38:02,683 --> 00:38:04,917
Well, looks like you've got
a student of your own now.

579
00:38:04,919 --> 00:38:06,484
Where-- Where is Maria?

580
00:38:06,486 --> 00:38:08,388
On a beach somewhere,
making a sandcastle.

581
00:38:11,626 --> 00:38:12,660
Hmm. Lucky her.

582
00:38:13,928 --> 00:38:15,360
There's tamales in the fridge.

583
00:38:15,362 --> 00:38:16,629
Help yourself.

584
00:38:16,631 --> 00:38:17,530
You know why we're here.

585
00:38:17,532 --> 00:38:20,933
It's not just
a friendly visit, then?

586
00:38:20,935 --> 00:38:22,835
I'm assuming that you know
that Dellrayne is out.

587
00:38:22,837 --> 00:38:24,469
I may have heard.

588
00:38:24,471 --> 00:38:25,938
What does he want?
What's he after?

589
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,006
Are you serious?

590
00:38:27,008 --> 00:38:28,475
Does it look like I'm kidding?

591
00:38:29,577 --> 00:38:30,978
-Domino.
-What's Domino?

592
00:38:32,113 --> 00:38:33,946
-A myth.
-Yeah. See, that's the thing.

593
00:38:33,948 --> 00:38:35,080
You kind of left too soon.

594
00:38:35,082 --> 00:38:37,382
-You said it was destroyed.
-Want to fill me in here?

595
00:38:37,384 --> 00:38:41,854
Project Domino,
Division's Holy Grail.

596
00:38:41,856 --> 00:38:43,923
It was a tool made in our lab--

597
00:38:43,925 --> 00:38:45,390
one that could control

598
00:38:45,392 --> 00:38:47,626
even the most powerful
hypnotics.

599
00:38:47,628 --> 00:38:48,594
-Even Dellrayne?
-Yeah.

600
00:38:48,596 --> 00:38:49,695
Yeah. Yeah.

601
00:38:49,697 --> 00:38:50,930
Especially Dellrayne.

602
00:38:50,932 --> 00:38:52,832
That's why he stole it from us.

603
00:38:52,834 --> 00:38:55,701
Then he reset his own mind
to hide the trail.

604
00:38:55,703 --> 00:38:56,702
When we finally caught him,

605
00:38:56,704 --> 00:38:58,403
he had no memory of who he was,

606
00:38:58,405 --> 00:38:59,839
what he'd done with Domino,
nothing.

607
00:38:59,841 --> 00:39:01,907
He erased his own mind?

608
00:39:01,909 --> 00:39:03,911
About six weeks ago,
it started to flood back.

609
00:39:05,046 --> 00:39:06,712
He broke out of our facility.

610
00:39:06,714 --> 00:39:10,816
He kind of, you know,
did the--fooled the guards.

611
00:39:10,818 --> 00:39:12,419
He must have planted triggers.

612
00:39:13,521 --> 00:39:15,921
It's clues the hypnotics
leave behind,

613
00:39:15,923 --> 00:39:18,090
like signposts
for their own subconscious.

614
00:39:18,092 --> 00:39:21,392
It can be words,
images, details.

615
00:39:21,394 --> 00:39:24,730
Puzzle pieces
that they use and scatter,

616
00:39:24,732 --> 00:39:25,998
in case their minds get reset.

617
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,432
You know,
put the jigsaw back together.

618
00:39:27,434 --> 00:39:28,466
Remember who they are.

619
00:39:28,468 --> 00:39:29,969
The safe-deposit boxes.

620
00:39:29,971 --> 00:39:31,436
He's following the breadcrumbs.

621
00:39:31,438 --> 00:39:32,705
Yes.

622
00:39:32,707 --> 00:39:34,439
He must have planted
a whole stream

623
00:39:34,441 --> 00:39:35,440
before we caught him.

624
00:39:35,442 --> 00:39:36,809
The first few?

625
00:39:36,811 --> 00:39:39,477
That just restored
a portion of his power.

626
00:39:39,479 --> 00:39:42,413
Each one,
he's going to get stronger.

627
00:39:42,415 --> 00:39:43,414
He gets the last one,

628
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:44,752
there's no stopping him.

629
00:39:46,486 --> 00:39:47,553
Where did you get that?

630
00:39:47,555 --> 00:39:48,888
The bank in Austin.

631
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:50,923
It was in the safe-deposit box
he was after.

632
00:39:50,925 --> 00:39:52,490
It's a picture of my daughter.

633
00:39:52,492 --> 00:39:55,828
Well, she may play
a role in all this.

634
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:56,795
It could be another trigger.

635
00:39:56,797 --> 00:39:57,899
Here. Let me see.

636
00:40:06,841 --> 00:40:07,975
What did you do to him?

637
00:40:10,144 --> 00:40:11,112
Who? This guy?

638
00:40:15,182 --> 00:40:16,517
Why are you backing up?

639
00:40:25,226 --> 00:40:26,426
Run.

640
00:40:47,581 --> 00:40:48,783
Get back!

641
00:41:30,558 --> 00:41:31,590
We're trapped!

642
00:41:31,592 --> 00:41:33,627
What you see isn't real.

643
00:42:26,047 --> 00:42:27,346
If you got any powers
you're holding out on,

644
00:42:27,348 --> 00:42:28,315
now's the time.

645
00:42:31,185 --> 00:42:32,186
All out.

646
00:42:40,061 --> 00:42:41,028
Rourke?

647
00:42:45,032 --> 00:42:46,333
Rourke?

648
00:42:58,646 --> 00:42:59,580
I'm not doing this.

649
00:43:03,784 --> 00:43:05,050
No.

650
00:43:05,052 --> 00:43:06,287
I am.

651
00:43:28,109 --> 00:43:29,208
It just doesn't make sense.

652
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:30,843
I mean, what?

653
00:43:30,845 --> 00:43:32,845
Do I have powers
all of a sudden?

654
00:43:32,847 --> 00:43:34,680
I mean, how did I do that?

655
00:43:34,682 --> 00:43:36,348
I don't know.

656
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:37,382
You saw it.

657
00:43:37,384 --> 00:43:39,151
You were right there.

658
00:43:39,153 --> 00:43:40,953
You know, one second,
he was coming right at me.

659
00:43:40,955 --> 00:43:41,987
The next minute,

660
00:43:41,989 --> 00:43:44,323
it was literally as if
I was inside their minds.

661
00:43:44,325 --> 00:43:45,824
Welcome to the club.

662
00:43:45,826 --> 00:43:47,759
That's not possible.

663
00:43:47,761 --> 00:43:49,128
I've never done anything
like this before.

664
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:50,195
I wouldn't know how.

665
00:43:50,197 --> 00:43:51,866
Or you just can't remember.

666
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,766
-I--
-What you just did?

667
00:43:54,768 --> 00:43:56,068
Power like this,

668
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:58,337
it takes more
than natural ability, okay?

669
00:43:58,339 --> 00:44:00,374
And I have no idea
how you did it.

670
00:44:02,443 --> 00:44:04,009
All right.
I have to know everything.

671
00:44:04,011 --> 00:44:06,111
Why me?

672
00:44:06,113 --> 00:44:07,913
Why my daughter?

673
00:44:07,915 --> 00:44:09,950
Dellrayne, Domino, this.

674
00:44:12,786 --> 00:44:14,121
Will you help me, please?

675
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,895
Yes.

676
00:44:26,167 --> 00:44:29,001
River is the guy
who built their network.

677
00:44:29,003 --> 00:44:30,235
If there's anyone

678
00:44:30,237 --> 00:44:33,172
who can hack into
their database,

679
00:44:33,174 --> 00:44:34,840
it's him.

680
00:44:34,842 --> 00:44:36,911
He helped me disappear
when I left Division.

681
00:44:39,146 --> 00:44:41,115
But fair warning...

682
00:44:42,783 --> 00:44:44,816
...he can be eccentric.

683
00:44:44,818 --> 00:44:47,321
Oh!
And you're the normal one.

684
00:44:49,924 --> 00:44:51,156
He's a friend.

685
00:44:51,158 --> 00:44:52,191
Uh-huh, yeah.

686
00:44:52,193 --> 00:44:54,026
Good illusions anyways.

687
00:44:54,028 --> 00:44:55,194
No illusion.

688
00:44:55,196 --> 00:44:56,962
We're real.

689
00:44:56,964 --> 00:44:58,132
We need your help.

690
00:45:00,334 --> 00:45:01,333
With Dellrayne.

691
00:45:01,335 --> 00:45:03,135
I-I can't help you.

692
00:45:03,137 --> 00:45:05,103
If he knows we're here,

693
00:45:05,105 --> 00:45:07,141
he'll torture
and reset you anyway.

694
00:45:19,386 --> 00:45:20,721
You're cold, Cruz.

695
00:45:21,889 --> 00:45:23,090
At least offer us a drink.

696
00:45:24,959 --> 00:45:26,126
I was going to.

697
00:45:27,161 --> 00:45:28,429
Anyways.

698
00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:33,734
I think.

699
00:45:42,276 --> 00:45:43,375
What happened to your eye?

700
00:45:43,377 --> 00:45:47,748
Asymmetrical shapes
help fool facial recognition.

701
00:45:50,217 --> 00:45:53,051
Camera drones and satellites
everywhere these days.

702
00:45:53,053 --> 00:45:54,488
Not to mention the Division.

703
00:45:58,792 --> 00:45:59,491
Are you inside
my mind right now?

704
00:45:59,493 --> 00:46:00,892
No.

705
00:46:00,894 --> 00:46:03,829
We're both friends.

706
00:46:03,831 --> 00:46:05,464
Amigos.

707
00:46:05,466 --> 00:46:06,900
Okay.

708
00:46:08,202 --> 00:46:11,303
Listen, uh, don't--
don't judge.

709
00:46:11,305 --> 00:46:13,140
I wasn't expecting visitors.

710
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:18,045
This way.

711
00:46:30,257 --> 00:46:31,792
Watch your step.

712
00:46:34,295 --> 00:46:35,894
You know,
you could have called, Diana.

713
00:46:35,896 --> 00:46:37,530
Sent a text,

714
00:46:37,532 --> 00:46:39,331
you know, one of those
little Morse code thingies.

715
00:46:39,333 --> 00:46:40,434
I do have radio, you know.

716
00:46:42,169 --> 00:46:43,402
Showing up unannounced
is just rude.

717
00:46:43,404 --> 00:46:44,836
Ah.

718
00:46:44,838 --> 00:46:47,041
Homemade Mountain Dew.

719
00:46:48,108 --> 00:46:49,107
My own brew.

720
00:46:49,109 --> 00:46:50,142
All organic.

721
00:46:50,144 --> 00:46:51,943
Uh, no thanks.

722
00:46:51,945 --> 00:46:52,946
All right. Huh?

723
00:46:54,381 --> 00:46:55,316
All right, fine.
More for me.

724
00:46:59,086 --> 00:47:01,186
Mm. Check it out.

725
00:47:01,188 --> 00:47:02,122
Pretty impressive, huh?

726
00:47:04,458 --> 00:47:05,625
Hypnotics did all this?

727
00:47:05,627 --> 00:47:06,592
Uh-huh.

728
00:47:06,594 --> 00:47:08,126
It's a worldwide play, brother.

729
00:47:08,128 --> 00:47:10,862
Controlling major news,
events, organizations.

730
00:47:10,864 --> 00:47:12,399
Why the hell
are you here, Diana?

731
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,901
Dellrayne is back.

732
00:47:15,903 --> 00:47:18,437
It has something to do
with Rourke's missing daughter.

733
00:47:18,439 --> 00:47:20,307
Dellrayne sent an army for us.

734
00:47:21,342 --> 00:47:23,410
Rourke, he took control.

735
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:26,947
He overpowered him.

736
00:47:34,622 --> 00:47:35,921
Huh.

737
00:47:35,923 --> 00:47:37,525
More than meets the eye, huh?

738
00:47:38,992 --> 00:47:40,392
Apparently.

739
00:47:40,394 --> 00:47:41,362
But to what degree?

740
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:44,198
Let's find out.

741
00:47:47,569 --> 00:47:48,835
All right, now listen,
I've got to tell you,

742
00:47:48,837 --> 00:47:51,338
hacking into a database this big
ain't easy-breezy, all right?

743
00:48:01,448 --> 00:48:05,083
All right, Austin PD database
has you employed 12 years.

744
00:48:05,085 --> 00:48:06,019
That's right.

745
00:48:07,589 --> 00:48:09,421
All right. I got a hit
for the Marine Corps.

746
00:48:09,423 --> 00:48:12,290
Distinguished Service medal,
honorable discharge.

747
00:48:12,292 --> 00:48:13,494
Said you had a family.

748
00:48:14,962 --> 00:48:16,063
Uh, let's see.

749
00:48:17,164 --> 00:48:19,333
Archives show no record
of a Daniel Rourke's spouse.

750
00:48:20,934 --> 00:48:22,033
Can't be.

751
00:48:22,035 --> 00:48:23,636
What was your wife's
maiden name?

752
00:48:23,638 --> 00:48:25,971
Riley. Vivian Riley.

753
00:48:25,973 --> 00:48:26,574
Vivian Riley.

754
00:48:30,512 --> 00:48:31,478
That's her.

755
00:48:33,013 --> 00:48:34,014
Whoa.

756
00:48:36,049 --> 00:48:38,183
"Vivian Riley...

757
00:48:38,185 --> 00:48:39,153
Division agent."

758
00:48:45,693 --> 00:48:48,026
That's impossible.

759
00:48:48,028 --> 00:48:49,029
"Current location encrypted."

760
00:48:50,397 --> 00:48:51,331
Can you hack it?

761
00:48:54,468 --> 00:48:56,234
I'll run something.

762
00:48:56,236 --> 00:48:57,335
It'll take a few hours.

763
00:48:57,337 --> 00:48:58,706
That's not right.

764
00:49:00,407 --> 00:49:02,142
We were together since college.

765
00:49:03,977 --> 00:49:07,414
I came home, had Minnie,
a family.

766
00:49:08,482 --> 00:49:09,684
This is my life.

767
00:49:10,752 --> 00:49:11,719
I'm sorry.

768
00:49:29,737 --> 00:49:31,238
You look like you need a drink.

769
00:49:33,407 --> 00:49:34,607
Moonshine.

770
00:49:34,609 --> 00:49:36,208
Thanks.

771
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:37,543
Burns a little,

772
00:49:37,545 --> 00:49:42,015
but at least
it will help you forget.

773
00:49:49,456 --> 00:49:50,457
When we lost Minnie...

774
00:49:51,759 --> 00:49:53,026
...we lost everything.

775
00:49:55,229 --> 00:49:56,228
We lost ourselves.

776
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:57,262
<i>The body</i>

777
00:49:57,264 --> 00:49:59,097
<i>of police Detective</i>
<i>Daniel Rourke's</i>

778
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:00,332
<i>missing daughter,</i>
<i>Minnie Rourke,</i>

779
00:50:00,334 --> 00:50:01,399
<i>has still not been recovered.</i>

780
00:50:01,401 --> 00:50:03,403
And I can't keep going!

781
00:50:04,572 --> 00:50:05,605
<i>Nothing we had survived.</i>

782
00:50:05,607 --> 00:50:07,207
I can't.

783
00:50:10,043 --> 00:50:11,211
<i>Maybe Viv lied</i>
<i>about who she was.</i>

784
00:50:14,214 --> 00:50:16,551
But the pain was real.

785
00:50:20,354 --> 00:50:22,489
Sometimes,
it's all I had to hold on to.

786
00:51:08,502 --> 00:51:10,870
Whatever you're selling,
I'm not interested.

787
00:51:10,872 --> 00:51:12,306
<i>You're never</i>
<i>going to find your daughter.</i>

788
00:51:13,608 --> 00:51:14,609
How about I kill you?

789
00:51:21,348 --> 00:51:22,347
<i>You think you're strong?</i>

790
00:51:22,349 --> 00:51:23,383
<i>More powerful than me?</i>

791
00:51:24,786 --> 00:51:26,086
<i>I have other ways</i>
<i>of getting to you.</i>

792
00:51:27,421 --> 00:51:29,287
<i>Diana betrayed me,</i>

793
00:51:29,289 --> 00:51:32,390
<i>and now you're going</i>
<i>to kill her.</i>

794
00:51:32,392 --> 00:51:33,728
<i>Put that gun in your hand.</i>

795
00:51:42,235 --> 00:51:43,437
<i>Put three bullets in her head.</i>

796
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:46,741
No.

797
00:51:56,283 --> 00:51:57,284
Diana.

798
00:52:01,923 --> 00:52:03,357
-Just a minute.
-Diana.

799
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:12,634
Di--

800
00:52:15,168 --> 00:52:16,169
I'm coming.

801
00:52:23,611 --> 00:52:24,779
I had to borrow
one of River's shirts.

802
00:52:28,783 --> 00:52:29,751
What happened?

803
00:52:33,688 --> 00:52:36,223
He got to you, didn't he?

804
00:52:43,798 --> 00:52:44,866
I can see it.

805
00:52:46,199 --> 00:52:47,401
I heard a phone ring.
Did you answer it?

806
00:52:48,936 --> 00:52:49,969
Yes.

807
00:52:49,971 --> 00:52:51,338
Did he speak?

808
00:52:52,439 --> 00:52:53,508
What did he tell you?

809
00:52:55,275 --> 00:52:56,410
I... I don't...

810
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:04,619
What is it that you see?

811
00:53:06,821 --> 00:53:07,722
I don't know.

812
00:53:17,765 --> 00:53:18,700
Where's your phone?

813
00:53:44,592 --> 00:53:45,893
I know things feel off.

814
00:54:01,008 --> 00:54:02,409
I know she hurt you.

815
00:54:06,614 --> 00:54:07,648
Do we have trust?

816
00:57:28,849 --> 00:57:31,050
Project Domino was never a what.

817
00:57:31,052 --> 00:57:32,620
No.

818
00:57:33,988 --> 00:57:35,089
It was a who.

819
00:57:38,059 --> 00:57:40,092
Where is she?

820
00:57:40,094 --> 00:57:42,695
Is she even alive?
Where did you take her?

821
00:57:42,697 --> 00:57:43,631
I didn't take her.

822
00:57:45,498 --> 00:57:46,834
You did.

823
00:57:50,905 --> 00:57:52,504
She's going
to have opportunities.

824
00:57:52,506 --> 00:57:53,405
On the one hand,

825
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:55,574
you think,
well, I really am the person

826
00:57:55,576 --> 00:57:56,976
that should make
these decisions,

827
00:57:56,978 --> 00:57:58,978
but on the other hand,
you're better off away from her.

828
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:00,012
I'm her mother.

829
00:58:00,014 --> 00:58:00,915
Yeah, well, I'm her father.

830
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:04,118
They wanted to take her.

831
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:06,852
The Division only wanted
to train her

832
00:58:06,854 --> 00:58:08,687
like they trained us--

833
00:58:08,689 --> 00:58:10,656
to be what she was born to be--

834
00:58:10,658 --> 00:58:12,893
the most powerful hypnotic
in the world.

835
00:58:13,961 --> 00:58:15,196
She was just a child.

836
00:58:32,747 --> 00:58:33,748
Minnie?

837
00:58:37,885 --> 00:58:39,618
You kidnapped our daughter.

838
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:42,823
I protected her from you.

839
00:58:46,927 --> 00:58:48,229
I protected her from all of you.

840
00:58:51,298 --> 00:58:52,233
Where are we now?

841
00:58:54,135 --> 00:58:55,202
Are we really even here?

842
00:58:57,304 --> 00:58:58,305
Can't you see it yet?

843
00:59:04,211 --> 00:59:05,246
Look closer.

844
00:59:40,381 --> 00:59:41,982
You're in on this, too, Nicks?

845
00:59:43,818 --> 00:59:44,852
Or whatever your name is?

846
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:47,955
You brought this on yourself.

847
00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:51,625
By the time we found you,
Domino was gone...

848
00:59:53,961 --> 00:59:56,061
...and you reset yourself.

849
00:59:56,063 --> 00:59:58,063
Wiped clean.

850
00:59:58,065 --> 01:00:00,065
No memory
of where you hid her...

851
01:00:00,067 --> 01:00:01,102
for four years.

852
01:00:02,036 --> 01:00:03,235
You've been an obstacle to me

853
01:00:03,237 --> 01:00:05,204
for too long, Rourke.

854
01:00:05,206 --> 01:00:07,208
This was dropped off
at Division headquarters...

855
01:00:08,742 --> 01:00:10,209
...six weeks ago.

856
01:00:10,211 --> 01:00:11,643
A clue or a taunt.

857
01:00:11,645 --> 01:00:12,913
You know what it means.

858
01:00:14,648 --> 01:00:16,217
Buried underneath
that psychic block.

859
01:00:17,918 --> 01:00:20,385
That's why we developed
this construct.

860
01:00:20,387 --> 01:00:22,921
The cop searching for the man
who took his missing daughter.

861
01:00:22,923 --> 01:00:24,656
Using my own brain against me.

862
01:00:24,658 --> 01:00:26,894
To get you to remember
where you hid her.

863
01:00:28,129 --> 01:00:29,394
Like it or not,

864
01:00:29,396 --> 01:00:31,699
your daughter is going to reach
her full potential with me.

865
01:00:33,701 --> 01:00:35,236
Who is Lev Dellrayne?

866
01:02:11,098 --> 01:02:12,766
This is where it always ends.

867
01:02:14,101 --> 01:02:16,303
We can't brute-force
a mind like yours, Dan.

868
01:02:18,172 --> 01:02:19,807
This was our 12th run
of the scenario.

869
01:02:21,041 --> 01:02:24,409
But every time we get too close,
you see the gaps,

870
01:02:24,411 --> 01:02:25,746
and the construct breaks.

871
01:02:28,916 --> 01:02:30,150
Just help us find her.

872
01:02:33,555 --> 01:02:36,522
You had 12 runs at this...

873
01:02:36,524 --> 01:02:37,958
and you haven't found her?

874
01:02:40,427 --> 01:02:43,264
Well, get ready for number 13.

875
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:47,401
Because I'll never
tell you where she is.

876
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:53,541
Take him in.

877
01:03:08,222 --> 01:03:09,456
Your mind
can't take much more...

878
01:03:13,193 --> 01:03:15,861
...of this...

879
01:03:15,863 --> 01:03:17,064
resets.

880
01:03:18,999 --> 01:03:20,132
At some point,

881
01:03:20,134 --> 01:03:22,100
the synapses
start breaking down,

882
01:03:22,102 --> 01:03:26,038
and it's too late
to get back what you were,

883
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:27,941
what we had.

884
01:03:29,611 --> 01:03:31,045
Was any of it real?

885
01:03:35,082 --> 01:03:36,250
I love you.

886
01:03:37,918 --> 01:03:39,587
Don't ask me why.

887
01:03:43,223 --> 01:03:44,291
You remember, don't you?

888
01:03:45,459 --> 01:03:47,061
The good times.

889
01:03:48,495 --> 01:03:49,963
We did have a few.

890
01:03:51,031 --> 01:03:52,266
I remember everything.

891
01:03:57,071 --> 01:03:58,839
I know we wanted
different things for her.

892
01:04:00,307 --> 01:04:03,377
I know you want her to be free
to make her own decisions.

893
01:04:07,047 --> 01:04:09,183
She's too powerful
to be out there alone.

894
01:04:10,484 --> 01:04:11,985
She needs her mom and dad.

895
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:14,556
We can be with her again.

896
01:04:17,324 --> 01:04:18,526
Together, Danny.

897
01:04:20,528 --> 01:04:22,162
Just tell me where she is.

898
01:04:29,136 --> 01:04:30,204
Go to hell.

899
01:04:54,161 --> 01:04:55,396
Initiate the reset.

900
01:05:22,557 --> 01:05:23,490
Where's your wife?

901
01:05:27,461 --> 01:05:28,495
I don't know.

902
01:05:29,631 --> 01:05:30,632
Where is your daughter?

903
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:33,967
I don't know.

904
01:05:35,637 --> 01:05:37,004
Have you ever been in love?

905
01:05:39,541 --> 01:05:41,173
I don't know.

906
01:05:41,175 --> 01:05:42,708
Subject is clear.

907
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:44,142
Prepare sequence.

908
01:05:44,144 --> 01:05:45,545
Okay.

909
01:05:45,547 --> 01:05:48,079
One kidnapping
coming right up.

910
01:05:48,081 --> 01:05:50,348
All right, people,
let's go to reset.

911
01:05:50,350 --> 01:05:52,085
Places, everybody.

912
01:06:01,629 --> 01:06:03,397
Okay, here we go.

913
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:27,287
Rourke?

914
01:06:32,627 --> 01:06:33,761
Rourke.

915
01:06:35,362 --> 01:06:36,564
Rourke?

916
01:06:37,765 --> 01:06:39,032
Come back to us.

917
01:06:44,471 --> 01:06:47,405
Sorry. Must have drifted off
for a second.

918
01:06:47,407 --> 01:06:48,406
It's okay.

919
01:06:48,408 --> 01:06:49,476
It's your time.

920
01:06:51,713 --> 01:06:52,612
Where was I?

921
01:06:52,614 --> 01:06:54,212
The park?

922
01:06:55,617 --> 01:06:57,382
Your daughter.

923
01:06:57,384 --> 01:06:59,317
Right.

924
01:06:59,319 --> 01:07:00,722
The park.

925
01:07:02,389 --> 01:07:03,525
Her hair.

926
01:07:05,693 --> 01:07:07,127
I remember her hair.

927
01:07:12,165 --> 01:07:13,833
Heart rate is normal.

928
01:07:13,835 --> 01:07:15,502
He's deep in the construct now.

929
01:07:50,872 --> 01:07:54,172
<i>Alleged kidnapper</i>
<i>18-year old Lyle Terry</i>

930
01:07:54,174 --> 01:07:57,208
<i>has pled not guilty</i>
<i>due to mental incapacity,</i>

931
01:07:57,210 --> 01:08:00,312
<i>his lawyers insisting</i>
<i>he has no memory whatsoever...</i>

932
01:08:04,552 --> 01:08:06,086
He's noting where
his wedding band used to be.

933
01:08:07,689 --> 01:08:08,756
That's my cue.

934
01:08:25,607 --> 01:08:26,706
You lose something, compadre?

935
01:08:26,708 --> 01:08:27,675
Cockroach.

936
01:08:28,743 --> 01:08:30,141
Yeah, it's a hot day.

937
01:08:30,143 --> 01:08:31,111
The damn things are everywhere.

938
01:08:33,915 --> 01:08:35,648
Hey.

939
01:08:35,650 --> 01:08:37,518
Did you wipe your shoes?

940
01:08:41,589 --> 01:08:42,922
Call came into dispatch.

941
01:08:42,924 --> 01:08:44,291
Blocked number.

942
01:08:45,793 --> 01:08:47,593
<i>I'm calling to report a robbery.</i>

943
01:08:47,595 --> 01:08:49,396
<i>Is this crime</i>
<i>currently in progress?</i>

944
01:08:50,665 --> 01:08:52,197
<i>Today, the Bank of Austin.</i>

945
01:08:52,199 --> 01:08:53,498
<i>There's a safe-deposit box.</i>

946
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:55,268
<i>Box 23.</i>

947
01:09:01,542 --> 01:09:02,877
We're here.

948
01:09:17,290 --> 01:09:18,392
Welcome to the show, boys.

949
01:09:29,937 --> 01:09:30,838
See that guy on the bench?

950
01:09:33,841 --> 01:09:34,809
He looks familiar.

951
01:09:37,912 --> 01:09:38,846
Something wrong, bud?

952
01:09:43,751 --> 01:09:46,351
<i>It's a sunny day.</i>

953
01:09:46,353 --> 01:09:47,287
The guards are in on it.

954
01:09:48,723 --> 01:09:49,691
Rourke.
Rourke, wait!

955
01:09:57,532 --> 01:09:58,700
Get ready for the bank robbery.

956
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:26,627
Where's Rourke?

957
01:10:29,329 --> 01:10:30,428
Where's Rourke?

958
01:10:30,430 --> 01:10:31,997
River?

959
01:10:31,999 --> 01:10:33,298
Where is he?

960
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:33,999
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I don't have eyes.

961
01:10:34,001 --> 01:10:35,266
Stand by.

962
01:10:35,268 --> 01:10:36,602
Anybody got eyes on Rourke?

963
01:10:41,709 --> 01:10:43,509
All hands on deck.

964
01:10:43,511 --> 01:10:44,712
Subject has broken through.

965
01:11:02,597 --> 01:11:04,632
Stop.

966
01:11:06,667 --> 01:11:07,869
Turn off the engine.

967
01:11:09,336 --> 01:11:10,603
And step out.

968
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:15,007
Rourke...

969
01:11:15,009 --> 01:11:16,644
turn off the engine.

970
01:11:21,082 --> 01:11:23,050
And step out.

971
01:11:46,373 --> 01:11:48,774
Get the helicopter.
Send everyone.

972
01:11:48,776 --> 01:11:50,408
-Don't lose him.
-His notebook.

973
01:11:50,410 --> 01:11:51,877
He tore out a page,
but look what he wrote down.

974
01:11:51,879 --> 01:11:54,048
Deer Valley Lane.

975
01:11:56,349 --> 01:11:57,883
Lev Dellrayne is not a name.

976
01:11:57,885 --> 01:12:00,387
It's a trigger he left
to remember her location.

977
01:12:34,689 --> 01:12:35,422
Took you long enough.

978
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:40,061
- You alone?
- For now.

979
01:12:41,128 --> 01:12:42,029
They'll be here soon.

980
01:12:43,430 --> 01:12:44,632
Where is she?

981
01:12:50,071 --> 01:12:51,570
I've got something.

982
01:12:51,572 --> 01:12:53,105
It looks like Deer Valley Lane

983
01:12:53,107 --> 01:12:54,607
dead-ends into a cattle ranch

984
01:12:54,609 --> 01:12:56,675
belonging to
a Carl and Thelma Everett.

985
01:12:56,677 --> 01:12:57,676
What's their link to Rourke?

986
01:12:57,678 --> 01:12:59,612
There's nothing in the file.

987
01:12:59,614 --> 01:13:01,782
He must have hid Minnie
with them all this time.

988
01:13:04,151 --> 01:13:07,387
It says here they had
a foster kid 40 years ago.

989
01:13:11,826 --> 01:13:12,793
It's Rourke.

990
01:13:16,597 --> 01:13:18,530
Before this goes down,
I need to know something.

991
01:13:18,532 --> 01:13:20,134
Why did you trust us with her?

992
01:13:22,103 --> 01:13:24,203
You taught me
everything I know, Carl,

993
01:13:24,205 --> 01:13:25,271
including how to keep

994
01:13:25,273 --> 01:13:26,872
a moral compass pointed
in the right direction.

995
01:13:27,942 --> 01:13:29,942
Is this going to work?

996
01:13:29,944 --> 01:13:30,878
If you're ready.

997
01:13:36,617 --> 01:13:37,885
You'd best get inside.

998
01:14:59,533 --> 01:15:00,668
Hi, Daddy.

999
01:15:02,169 --> 01:15:03,104
I set them up for you.

1000
01:15:05,172 --> 01:15:06,240
I've missed you, baby.

1001
01:15:23,324 --> 01:15:24,658
She's here.

1002
01:16:11,072 --> 01:16:13,806
Read the signs, jackass.

1003
01:16:15,943 --> 01:16:19,678
Private goddamn property.

1004
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:20,714
Hold your fire.

1005
01:16:23,084 --> 01:16:24,018
We missed you, sweetheart.

1006
01:16:29,190 --> 01:16:30,357
I don't know you.

1007
01:16:32,026 --> 01:16:33,828
We love you like our own, Diana.

1008
01:16:35,196 --> 01:16:36,630
But we'll still put
a hole in you.

1009
01:16:38,732 --> 01:16:40,866
You have my daughter

1010
01:16:40,868 --> 01:16:42,803
and we're not leaving here
without her.

1011
01:16:47,174 --> 01:16:48,809
Kill them.

1012
01:16:50,211 --> 01:16:51,245
Carl!

1013
01:16:54,115 --> 01:16:55,747
No! Get medical.

1014
01:16:55,749 --> 01:16:56,784
We need medical!

1015
01:16:57,885 --> 01:16:59,051
We're not here for them.

1016
01:16:59,053 --> 01:17:00,054
Where is she?

1017
01:17:01,222 --> 01:17:02,623
Where's Minnie?

1018
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:09,027
Whatever Rourke has told you,
it's a lie.

1019
01:17:09,029 --> 01:17:11,296
She won't be safe until
she's back with us at Division.

1020
01:17:11,298 --> 01:17:12,700
That's where she belongs.

1021
01:17:14,168 --> 01:17:15,236
That's not you talking.

1022
01:17:17,204 --> 01:17:18,372
That's the Division.

1023
01:17:20,407 --> 01:17:22,774
The Diana I know,

1024
01:17:22,776 --> 01:17:25,010
the woman I love,

1025
01:17:25,012 --> 01:17:26,714
wouldn't want this life
for our little girl.

1026
01:17:28,282 --> 01:17:29,314
Think about that.

1027
01:17:29,316 --> 01:17:30,382
There's no escaping us.

1028
01:17:30,384 --> 01:17:31,886
You know that.

1029
01:17:33,354 --> 01:17:35,187
You know the consequences.

1030
01:17:35,189 --> 01:17:37,923
There's only two ways this ends.

1031
01:17:37,925 --> 01:17:40,726
You and Minnie
come back to Division,

1032
01:17:40,728 --> 01:17:43,297
or Minnie comes back
without you.

1033
01:17:47,701 --> 01:17:49,003
It's all right, sweetheart.
Come on out.

1034
01:18:11,759 --> 01:18:13,093
You're so big.

1035
01:18:15,229 --> 01:18:16,330
You're safe now.

1036
01:18:17,364 --> 01:18:18,465
You're safe.

1037
01:18:21,135 --> 01:18:23,468
You still wear braids.

1038
01:18:23,470 --> 01:18:24,937
I make them myself now.

1039
01:18:24,939 --> 01:18:26,340
Of course you do.

1040
01:18:29,210 --> 01:18:30,311
I'm so proud of you, Mommy.

1041
01:18:34,048 --> 01:18:35,180
Proud of me for what?

1042
01:18:35,182 --> 01:18:36,383
For coming home.

1043
01:18:43,224 --> 01:18:44,325
We're setting ourselves free.

1044
01:18:46,528 --> 01:18:47,761
From them.

1045
01:18:51,365 --> 01:18:52,466
No.

1046
01:18:53,834 --> 01:18:54,802
When did she...

1047
01:19:03,143 --> 01:19:04,445
This isn't real.

1048
01:19:07,114 --> 01:19:08,415
We're not here!

1049
01:19:14,154 --> 01:19:15,356
It's a construct!

1050
01:19:16,524 --> 01:19:17,891
It's her!

1051
01:19:30,838 --> 01:19:31,972
Uh...

1052
01:19:41,915 --> 01:19:43,817
You're doing this.

1053
01:19:47,087 --> 01:19:48,222
I love you.

1054
01:19:49,390 --> 01:19:50,455
I love you, too.

1055
01:19:50,457 --> 01:19:52,326
I'm going to bring you back now.

1056
01:19:56,030 --> 01:19:57,097
Close your eyes.

1057
01:21:52,212 --> 01:21:53,178
Have you ever been in love?

1058
01:21:53,180 --> 01:21:54,181
Where am I?

1059
01:21:55,650 --> 01:21:56,917
Where am I?

1060
01:22:04,425 --> 01:22:06,124
Have you ever been in love?

1061
01:22:06,126 --> 01:22:07,094
Help!

1062
01:22:08,563 --> 01:22:09,662
Where am I?

1063
01:22:09,664 --> 01:22:10,998
Help!

1064
01:22:26,146 --> 01:22:27,549
Help!

1065
01:22:39,493 --> 01:22:40,728
Do you remember now, Mommy?

1066
01:22:44,465 --> 01:22:45,665
When she was born,

1067
01:22:45,667 --> 01:22:47,201
we prayed
she wouldn't be like us.

1068
01:22:48,536 --> 01:22:49,470
That she would be normal.

1069
01:22:51,606 --> 01:22:52,805
<i>But soon, we understood</i>

1070
01:22:52,807 --> 01:22:55,240
<i>that the daughter</i>
<i>of two powerful hypnotics</i>

1071
01:22:55,242 --> 01:22:56,511
<i>would have</i>
<i>an extraordinary gift.</i>

1072
01:22:58,546 --> 01:22:59,679
<i>It would help the world explore</i>

1073
01:22:59,681 --> 01:23:02,082
<i>the untapped abilities</i>
<i>of the human mind.</i>

1074
01:23:07,087 --> 01:23:08,588
<i>The Division realized</i>

1075
01:23:08,590 --> 01:23:11,757
<i>that Minnie's power</i>
<i>could transform society--</i>

1076
01:23:11,759 --> 01:23:15,393
<i>not to unlock human potential,</i>

1077
01:23:15,395 --> 01:23:19,297
<i>but to force people</i>
<i>to do what they were told...</i>

1078
01:23:19,299 --> 01:23:20,568
<i>or else.</i>

1079
01:23:24,572 --> 01:23:25,707
<i>They wanted</i>
<i>Minnie to be their weapon.</i>

1080
01:23:29,744 --> 01:23:32,210
<i>We wanted our daughter</i>
<i>to be free,</i>

1081
01:23:32,212 --> 01:23:34,112
<i>but we knew we could never</i>
<i>outrun the Division.</i>

1082
01:23:34,114 --> 01:23:35,615
<i>They would never let us go.</i>

1083
01:23:35,617 --> 01:23:38,383
<i>The only way</i>
<i>to escape any of them</i>

1084
01:23:38,385 --> 01:23:40,686
<i>was to bring them all together,</i>

1085
01:23:40,688 --> 01:23:42,522
<i>and destroy the Division</i>
<i>completely.</i>

1086
01:23:42,524 --> 01:23:44,089
Wake up, sweetie.

1087
01:23:44,091 --> 01:23:45,627
<i>But we couldn't</i>
<i>take them on ourselves.</i>

1088
01:23:50,464 --> 01:23:51,633
She wasn't ready yet.

1089
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:54,201
<i>That's why we had to wait.</i>

1090
01:23:55,369 --> 01:23:56,769
<i>Three years,</i>

1091
01:23:56,771 --> 01:23:57,739
<i>maybe more.</i>

1092
01:23:59,306 --> 01:24:00,608
<i>Then she'd be strong enough.</i>

1093
01:24:02,309 --> 01:24:03,477
<i>That's when she'd send</i>
<i>the trigger.</i>

1094
01:24:04,812 --> 01:24:06,679
<i>Tip the first domino,</i>

1095
01:24:06,681 --> 01:24:08,446
<i>to lead them out here...</i>

1096
01:24:08,448 --> 01:24:09,684
<i>and kill them.</i>

1097
01:24:11,351 --> 01:24:13,385
And we knew the only way

1098
01:24:13,387 --> 01:24:15,387
to keep our plan
from the Division

1099
01:24:15,389 --> 01:24:17,523
was to erase our own memories.

1100
01:24:17,525 --> 01:24:19,190
Help!

1101
01:24:19,192 --> 01:24:20,560
Where am I?

1102
01:24:20,562 --> 01:24:22,229
Help!

1103
01:24:24,431 --> 01:24:25,831
<i>We reset ourselves</i>

1104
01:24:25,833 --> 01:24:30,335
and believed
we loved each other so much,

1105
01:24:30,337 --> 01:24:31,438
we would find each other again.

1106
01:24:34,542 --> 01:24:35,608
Minnie and I,

1107
01:24:35,610 --> 01:24:37,375
we're your most stubborn
memories,

1108
01:24:37,377 --> 01:24:39,210
the hardest ones to erase.

1109
01:24:39,212 --> 01:24:40,447
I didn't want to let you go.

1110
01:24:42,584 --> 01:24:43,651
Now you never have to.

1111
01:24:47,589 --> 01:24:48,723
What now?

1112
01:24:51,458 --> 01:24:53,293
We finally get to decide that
for ourselves.

1113
01:24:57,364 --> 01:24:58,498
We're free.

1114
01:25:01,201 --> 01:25:02,704
We're finally free.

1115
01:26:33,961 --> 01:26:35,795
Y'all go on ahead.

1116
01:26:35,797 --> 01:26:37,865
I'll clean up here
and follow you.
