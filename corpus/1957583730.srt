1
00:00:03,036 --> 00:00:12,172
I

2
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:18,609
(chattering)

3
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:22,654
I saw that, Sara.

4
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:26,023
Qops. Don't tell my boss
I was too busy to bake anything.

5
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:27,652
Your secret's safe with me.

6
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,685
Uh, but only if I
get the first one.

7
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,721
Done.

8
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:33,096
I need your help
with something -

9
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:34,430
Carson Ranch.

10
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:35,663
The cattle ranch in Montana.

11
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,067
That's the one.

12
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:38,333
They need to take
out a second loan

13
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:39,737
to cover their losses
from the drought.

14
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:42,606
Yeah, a lot of farms and ranches
really suffered out there.

15
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:44,475
They did, they did.

16
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:46,673
The problem is, this loan isn't
going to be approved

17
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,681
unless the Carsons can show
they can make the payments.

18
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,547
Right now,
they're barely breaking even.

19
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:52,575
So they need to cut their costs,
orincrease their income.

20
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:55,486
Yeah. You tell that
to Travis Carson.

21
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:58,355
He's as stubborn as they come,
wants to do things his way.

22
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,360
Have you done a site visit?

23
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:03,125
Actually,
that's where you come in.

24
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:04,562
I want you to go.

25
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:07,761
Aren't site visits
a VP thing?

26
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:11,601
Mm-hmm. Sara, you're one of the
best financial advisors we have

27
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:13,606
and we think you'd
make an even better VP.

28
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,608
This is your chance to show it.

29
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:17,508
Thank you, Peter.

30
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:19,706
I appreciate the opportunity
more than you know.

31
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:23,580
But, full disclosure,
I know nothing about ranching.

32
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:25,711
That's exactly why
I want you to go.

33
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,312
You can analyze this business
from a fresh perspective,

34
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:30,187
maybe find a solution
that we didn't think of.

35
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:32,749
Okay then.
Of course I'll go.

36
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:35,285
So, are you thinking
early January?

37
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:36,694
We can't wait that long.

38
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,358
No, this loan needs
to close by Christmas.

39
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:41,299
I need you to go tomorrow.

40
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:46,239
Well, I can book a return
flight for the 23rd.

41
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,469
So, ho matter what happens,
you'll be home for Christmas.

42
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:53,274
Sara, what's wrong?
This is a great opportunity.

43
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:55,247
ltis. It's just...

44
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:57,649
Chloe's on Christmas
break starts tomorrow.

45
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:59,174
Oh, bring her with you.

46
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:05,250
Look, I know that
ever since Rob passed away,

47
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,852
Christmas has been rough
on you and Chloe.

48
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:11,494
It just hasn't had
the same feeling to it.

49
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:12,692
Well, right,

50
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:15,293
so maybe a chance of
scenery would help.

51
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:18,236
You'll get plenty of that
in the Big Sky State.

52
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,501
Come on, I'm sure
Chloe will love it.

53
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:27,837
Chloe:
Do I have to come with you?

54
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,679
It's just for a
couple of days, Chloe.

55
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:32,413
But Montana's
like the wilderness.

56
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:34,614
What if there's no Wi-Fi?

57
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:37,352
I think you have the wrong idea
about what Montana is like.

58
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:40,583
Do you know what it's like?

59
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:43,756
No, but tomorrow,
we're both going to find out.

60
00:02:57,577 --> 00:03:09,478
I

61
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:27,865
{exhaling sharply)

62
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:29,273
(horn honking)

63
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:30,470
{exhaling sharply)

64
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,773
(shivering)
Is your jacket working?

65
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:34,474
Apparently not.

66
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:36,573
Okay. Come on, sweetie.

67
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,316
Kay:
Welcome to Kay's Place.

68
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:45,586
Nice to meet you.

69
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,990
I'm Sara Bradley,
and this is my daughter Chloe.

70
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,353
Hi.

71
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,295
Oh, you two look freezing.

72
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,991
Come on in. Sit down, please...

73
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,222
Thank you.

74
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:54,665
while I get you checked in.

75
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:57,602
And I will bring you
some hot cider

76
00:03:57,637 --> 00:04:00,299
and some homemade fruitcake.

77
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,705
Thank you.

78
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:07,807
Well?

79
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:10,681
I've never actually
had fruitcake before,

80
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:14,517
so this is officially the best
fruitcake I've ever had.

81
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,818
(laughing)
I like you.

82
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:17,983
Thank you.

83
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:19,423
You're welcome.

84
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,722
Oh, do you have a
Wi-Fi password?

85
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:21,956
Oh, we don't have Wi-Fi.

86
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:23,429
I told you!

87
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:25,261
I'm joking.

88
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:29,030
Its "StarBigSkyChristmas,
exclamation point."

89
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,397
Even your Wi-Fi
is Christmassy.

90
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,497
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

91
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,669
Chloe, please don't be
on your phone the whole time.

92
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,007
You're gonna be working.

93
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,741
I don't know
what else to do.

94
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:44,945
Go down to the end of the block,
and turn right.

95
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:47,647
There's a lot of
cute holiday shopping.

96
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,919
It was nice of Kay to loan us
that hat and these mittens.

97
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,293
Yeah, except they don't
have the little thingy

98
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,321
on the fingertips
to use on touch screens.

99
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:02,734
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

100
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:07,673
(instrumental version
of "Jingle Bells" plays)

101
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,346
Oh, Mom,
let's look over here.

102
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:21,650
Sure.

103
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,486
Hello.
- Chloe: Hi.

104
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:25,821
Welcome to
St. Nick's Knickknacks.

105
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:28,624
Wow, that's the best name
for a Christmas shop ever.

106
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,824
Well, it used to be called
Jeffs Christmas Hut,

107
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:32,354
but that didn't catch on.

108
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,889
(chuckling)

109
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:35,595
Oh, sweetie, that's so pretty.

110
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:37,364
You could put that
on your charm bracelet.

111
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:39,338
Chloe:
Oh, that's okay.

112
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:40,703
I don't wear that anymore.

113
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,674
Uh, can I help you
find something else?

114
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,372
A candy cane, perhaps?

115
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:49,713
Or, ooh, better -
this candy cane.

116
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:51,911
Right?
Beautiful.

117
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:55,650
Locally made. No, wait.
Better... artisanal.

118
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,817
Which is another word
for expensive.

119
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,418
As freakishly large candy canes
go, it's a bargain.

120
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,950
You're a really good salesman.

121
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:03,520
Thank you.

122
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:04,928
Not even my booth or my job.

123
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:06,729
I'm just filling in
a friend's wife.

124
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,825
That's really nice of you.

125
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,701
It's how we do
things around here.

126
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:15,541
Well, you seem to have
a knack for it.

127
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:16,838
- Nailed it.
- Nailed it.

128
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,811
Wow, in St. Nick of time.

129
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:20,142
Ohl Yeah, there was a line in--

130
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,142
- Too far?
- Yeah.

131
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,473
- Man: Okay.

132
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:23,880
Sara: You just went right
over that line.

133
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:25,407
- Man: I think it worked.
- Sara: I thought it was funny.

134
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:27,648
Mom, chocolate.

135
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:29,849
Oh, um,
I guess I'm going this way.

136
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,824
Have a merry Christmas.

137
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:34,156
You too.

138
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,555
Ooh!

139
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:38,030
{man chuckling)

140
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:48,600
I

141
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:12,422
Wow. This is not
how I pictured it.

142
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:13,694
It's beautiful.

143
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:14,859
Afternoon.

144
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,892
Welcome to Carson Ranch.

145
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,463
Thank you. I'm Sara Bradley,
from Mayer/Hall.

146
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:20,632
I'm looking for Travis Carson.

147
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:22,199
Right name, wrong generation.

148
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,673
You're looking for
my son Travis Jr.

149
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:27,111
And are you Ms. Bradley's
executive assistant?

150
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:29,479
No. Her daughter.

151
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:31,848
(chuckling)
Well, I'm glad to meet you both.

152
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:33,182
Well, let's find out
where he is, huh?

153
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:35,813
Beautiful day.
Much warmer than yesterday.

154
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,090
This place is incredible,
Mr. Carson.

155
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,463
Oh, call me "Pops."

156
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,596
Oh, hold tight.
I'll get you some hot cocoa.

157
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,629
Wow.

158
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:56,574
Luckily, people in Montana like
serving warm beverages.

159
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:01,175
Okay, here you go.

160
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:04,673
- Both: Thank you.
- (phone chiming)

161
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:07,847
Yeah, Junior's on his way back.

162
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:10,948
Hey, our head ranch hand J.T's
daughter's about your age.

163
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,550
Uh, name's Lexie.

164
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:14,151
I think she's out back
helping with the horses.

165
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:15,821
Why don't I introduce you?

166
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,728
Okay.

167
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:19,061
Huh? Come on.

168
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,567
Why do you guys decorate
the inside of a barn?

169
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:34,979
Well, the horses
love Christmas, too.

170
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,746
They like to pretend
their reindeer.

171
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,510
Oh, Lexie, there you are.

172
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,283
This is Chloe.

173
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,582
Her mom's here doing some
business with us.

174
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,595
Hi. Do you want to help
me brush the horses?

175
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:51,689
I've actually never even
pet a horse before.

176
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,597
It's easy. Come on.
She's really gentle.

177
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:54,759
Go ahead.

178
00:08:58,071 --> 00:08:59,732
Just touch her.

179
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:01,036
Do I justcircleitor...?

180
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:02,098
- Yeah, circle.
- Chloe: Okay.

181
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:03,576
Lexie: There you go, you got it.

182
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,975
- Chloe: Like this?
- Lexie: Yeah.

183
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:07,639
Hi. Oh, he's so calm.

184
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,875
{phone vibrating)

185
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:11,282
Oh, I have to take this.

186
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:22,155
Hi.

187
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:24,721
Hi.

188
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:28,257
So, this is where
you really work.

189
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:32,602
Yes, my career in Christmas
novelties was short but sweet.

190
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,040
Uh...

191
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,043
What are you doing here?

192
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,671
Oh, I'm meeting
with Travis Carson.

193
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:41,806
He's expecting me.
I'm Sara Bradley.

194
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:43,338
Oh.

195
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,914
Travis Carson.

196
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:49,353
Really?

197
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,183
Yeah.
What were you expecting?

198
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:55,286
A gigantic belt buckle
and a lasso?

199
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:57,763
Of course not.

200
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:58,923
Oh, let me help.

201
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:02,026
Oh, thank you.

202
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:04,935
So, I-l just want
to say up front

203
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:06,336
that we are on the same team.

204
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:09,603
Okay? We, uh-- ooh.

205
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:11,337
We both want you to
get that loan approved.

206
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:12,867
You know that, right?

207
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:16,212
And I just want to say
that Peter's recommendations

208
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:19,708
to cut labor are a non-starter.

209
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:24,188
Those men are my family.

210
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:26,750
Well, that's why I'm here...

211
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,727
to help you find a different way

212
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:31,287
to get out the numbers
you need to show the bank.

213
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:33,925
And if you can't?

214
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,732
1 will.

215
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:43,135
You know what?
I just came over to say hello

216
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:44,735
before we start tomorrow.

217
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:47,178
I probably should get back to
the inn and get some rest.

218
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:48,977
Of course.

219
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:51,382
Okay.

220
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,888
(sighing)

221
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:58,118
Looks good.

222
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:01,389
Lexie: There you go.
I think she likes it.

223
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:04,794
How'd it go?

224
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,196
Oh, it's so fun.

225
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:08,291
It's way better
working with a friend.

226
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,132
Thanks for inviting
me to help.

227
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:14,107
Oh, Chloe, this
is Travis Carson Jr.

228
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,369
Hello.

229
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:19,777
The knickknack guy.

230
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,075
I'm actually a rancher guy.

231
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:23,048
And, if I may...

232
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:26,845
...this is my horse Rustler.

233
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,911
He's as gentle
as they come.

234
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,257
Sorry, I'm still not
really used to horses.

235
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:35,022
(chuckling)
That's okay.

236
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:37,393
Here's a funny thing
about Rustler -

237
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:41,025
he loves Christmas music,
he does.

238
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,434
(humming "Jingle Bells")
There he is.

239
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:44,868
Here, give it a try.

240
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,065
Oh, no, it's okay.

241
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:48,733
Come on.
♪ Jingle bells, jingle... ♪

242
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:51,005
♪ Bells, jingle all the way ♪

243
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,102
- (whinnying)
- There you go.

244
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:54,113
Good job, buddy.

245
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:56,013
You have a real way
with animals.

246
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,950
You wanna help with
the chicks in the back barn?

247
00:11:58,985 --> 00:11:59,975
Can we go right now?

248
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,714
Uh, we should be getting back.

249
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:03,722
Oh, yeah, you gotta
get back before rush hour.

250
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:04,882
Rush hour?

251
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:07,791
No. Just some
cattle crossing the road.

252
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:17,059
So, did you have fun today?

253
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,265
I guess.

254
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,069
What do you mean you guess?

255
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:24,342
It was okay.

256
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:26,004
You don't want to admit

257
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:28,309
that I was right about
Montana being an adventure.

258
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:31,875
So, does that mean

259
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,408
you don't want to go back
to the ranch with me tomorrow?

260
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:35,945
I didn't say that.

261
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,462
Hey.

262
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:55,531
They don't all have to
be white lights, you know.

263
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,801
Well, that's the way
Mom always used to do it.

264
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:01,246
That doesn't mean
it's set in stone.

265
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:04,012
Nothing really is.

266
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,313
We still talking
about the lights,

267
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,445
or we talking about
how I run the ranch?

268
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:10,286
Something has to give, son.

269
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:12,792
I know it's not your fault
that we're in this pinch.

270
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:15,487
Everyone's trying to recover
from the drought.

271
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:20,261
But... we really need that
second loan, you know?

272
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,495
Yeah.

273
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:24,504
I know it's tough
being the bad guy.

274
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:25,971
Butif it's a decision between

275
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:27,973
laying people off
and losing everything--

276
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:30,101
No, we're not laying anyone off.

277
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,134
I'd prefer to sell
part of the land.

278
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:34,875
Okay then.

279
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:35,938
Okay.

280
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:40,146
Can't hurt to hear
Sara's ideas.

281
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:42,416
And then, you're gonna have
to make a tough choice,

282
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:45,481
just like you did
when you moved back here.

283
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:47,323
Ah, that wasn't a tough choice.

284
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,488
I only moved away
because I wanted to try

285
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:51,998
something completely
different from this life.

286
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:53,556
(chuckling)

287
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:56,398
Well, corporate law is just
about as different as it gets.

288
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:59,167
(chuckling)
Yes, itis.

289
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:02,436
But after a while, I realized
I not only left home,

290
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:05,274
I left who I was.

291
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:08,576
My only regret is not
coming home sooner,

292
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:11,083
so I could spend
more time with Mom.

293
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:14,951
Now, there's nothing you
could've done for Mom back then.

294
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:16,978
And now, you're keeping
her Christmas traditions

295
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,082
alive and well.

296
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:24,463
But son, this ranch
is running on fumes.

297
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:28,127
You gotta make some changes
or accept the fact

298
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:31,501
that this could be the last
Christmas we spend here.

299
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:41,473
(sighin
9
See?

300
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:43,949
Sometimes changing things up...

301
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:47,112
makes what you
already have better.

302
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,983
The lights are a metaphor.

303
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:54,118
Oh, I get it, Dad.

304
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:59,521
And, uh, I hear you.

305
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:03,458
I know you do.

306
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:04,971
(horn honking)

307
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:15,341
{car door closing)

308
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:16,610
Morning.

309
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:18,310
Morning.

310
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:20,319
Pops said it was okay
if I brought Chloe

311
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:21,582
because Lexie's here.

312
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:23,680
Yeah, that's fine.

313
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,948
Uh, she's around back
with the chickens.

314
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:28,051
Do they like
Christmas carols, too?

315
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:29,687
They're more into Classic Rock.

316
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,296
Have fun.

317
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,397
Look, I meant everything
that I said yesterday.

318
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,701
But, uh...

319
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,431
I suppose I need
to let you do your job.

320
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:47,410
I talked some sense into him.

321
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,279
I owe you one.

322
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,046
Well, come on, let's goin.

323
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:57,454
After you.

324
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:04,061
Your timing's perfect -

325
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:07,122
Kay just dropped off some
of her candy cane cocoa.

326
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,099
Kay from the B&B?

327
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,465
Yeah, she's an old friend.

328
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:11,470
She's always bringing by her
home cooking from the inn.

329
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:14,030
Wow.
That's really nice of her.

330
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:17,338
Oh, people in town are always
coming by here at Christmas.

331
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:20,311
Kay comes over a little
more often than most.

332
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:23,213
Have a seat.
I'll get you some cocoa.

333
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:24,614
Oh, can I get that to go?

334
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,209
I'd really like
to get started.

335
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:27,742
Can we go into your office
and dig into the books?

336
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,250
Easy there.

337
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:30,585
You don't walk through
someone's front door

338
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:33,183
and get straight to business.

339
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:34,523
You're on Montana time.

340
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,494
What does that mean?

341
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:40,466
That means, here,
we don't rush things,

342
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,195
especially at Christmas.

343
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:45,671
We take our time to sit
and chat and eat cookies

344
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:47,571
and drink candy cane cocoa.

345
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:49,200
Then, we start.
Thank you.

346
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:51,438
Oh, is that a
showman-shaped marshmallow?

347
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:53,775
Yeah, Kay makes them
special for the bonfire

348
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,608
and she gives me
any extras, of course.

349
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,175
So, do you sell the
cocoa at the bonfire?

350
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,312
Of course not.
They're friends.

351
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,721
Oh, and she dropped
by some sausage rolls.

352
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,588
Or have you already tried
them at the inn?

353
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:09,220
Actually, I'm a vegetarian.

354
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:11,754
Oh, well, we won't
hold that against you.

355
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:14,391
I'll go see if the girls
want some cocoa.

356
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:17,459
I'm really glad that
Chloe's found a friend.

357
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:20,473
It's not easy being
an only child,

358
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:21,735
especially when it's just
the two of us now.

359
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,299
Travis:
I bet.

360
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,106
How 'bout you? Any kids?

361
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:27,704
Always wanted to, yeah.

362
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:29,579
Christmas with my parents

363
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:31,709
was probably
the best time of my life.

364
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:33,742
But, uh...

365
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:36,153
sometimes things don't work out
the way that you planned.

366
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:39,158
Yeah, Chloe and I
know that firsthand.

367
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:45,061
The other thing I know is that
we have a lot of work to do.

368
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:47,191
Wow.
That was a terrible segue.

369
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,223
-Wasn'tit?
- Mm-hmm.

370
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:49,632
But seriously,

371
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:52,798
I'd like to start by digging
into last year's cash flow.

372
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:54,499
Have you finished your cocoa?

373
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,634
No.

374
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:58,269
You know the rules.

375
00:17:58,311 --> 00:18:00,302
You're not going to
make this easy, are you?

376
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:02,542
Nothing worth doing ever is.

377
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:03,708
Fine.

378
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:12,783
Ready?

379
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:16,759
I reckon I am.

380
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:17,854
Great. Let's get started.

381
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,428
This way.

382
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:28,539
(horse whinnying)

383
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:34,404
Is this your office?

384
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,472
No, this is a barn.
(chuckling)

385
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:37,812
I just wanted to
give you a little tour

386
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,614
before you bury
yourself in the numbers.

387
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:42,349
The ranch is about a lot more
than just what's on paper.

388
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:48,592
This is beautiful.
How old is it?

389
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:49,891
About 150 years.

390
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,723
Sara: So, what do you do
with it at Christmas?

391
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:54,494
We host the annual
Christmas potluck,

392
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:56,661
and until then,
it's usually storage.

393
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:58,670
I hate to tell you this,
but you've been robbed.

394
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:01,264
Well, we haven't set it up yet.

395
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,605
We have eight days
until Christmas Eve,

396
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,475
and by then, this entire barn

397
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:06,808
is gonna be
a Christmas wonderland.

398
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:09,144
Everybody pitches in

399
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:10,876
to set up the tables,
and the centerpieces,

400
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,283
and even a stage for musicians.

401
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,515
That sounds expensive.

402
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:17,784
So, what's the overhead
on this dinner?

403
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,793
Zero.
Everybody pitches in.

404
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:24,456
Have you ever considered
renting this place out

405
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,864
for weddings or special events?

406
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:28,560
That's not what
this place is for.

407
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:29,762
Could be.

408
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:32,863
Ahh...

409
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:35,499
Wow.

410
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,635
Right? My mom collected these

411
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:40,476
over all the years our family
hosted the Christmas potluck.

412
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:43,881
When she passed, I promised her
that I would keep it going.

413
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,408
I do hope this
isn't the last one.

414
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:49,251
I've already thought of a
couple of ways to cut costs.

415
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,586
Well, if those ways involve our
Christmas traditions,

416
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:52,785
you can forget it.

417
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:56,659
I would never ask anyone
to give up Christmas

418
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:59,859
Isn't that what you're doing?

419
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:03,460
I'm doing my job,
and I'm gonna need your help.

420
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:07,632
And you'll get it...

421
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:10,404
...right after I do my job.

422
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:25,219
Are you going
all the way up there?

423
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:26,782
Well, unless you want to.

424
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:28,521
Maybe you could have
one of the ranch hands do it

425
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:29,824
and we could
go back to your office.

426
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:31,455
Oh, they're out getting feed,

427
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:32,987
or moving the cattle, making
sure the pipes are flowing...

428
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,963
What are you writing down?

429
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:38,800
This is just valuable
information

430
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:41,000
about your
day-to-day operations.

431
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,732
Well, outside of Christmas,
on any given day,

432
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:46,245
I'd be working
right alongside them.

433
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:47,905
Okay.

434
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:50,917
You write that down.
That's important.

435
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,009
That's a cowboy's worth ethic.

436
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,481
You wouldn't ask anyone
to do anything

437
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,578
you wouldn't do yourself.

438
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:58,750
Got it.

439
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:01,688
What?

440
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:03,559
Just seems like a waste
of perfectly nice garland

441
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,530
to put it all the way
up in the rafters.

442
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:09,000
Oh.
Well, what do you suggest?

443
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:12,732
Well, a few years ago,

444
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:15,639
we did this zig-zag with garland

445
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:17,642
to look like a Christmas tree
all the way up the wall.

446
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:20,976
We threaded in some lights

447
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:23,710
and we put a star on top.
It was really beautiful.

448
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:28,311
Okay. That sounds interesting.
You have any pictures?

449
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:31,881
Um, I don't know,
that's going back a while.

450
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:34,450
We've tried to keep
Christmas pretty low-key

451
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:37,292
since my husband passed away.

452
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:40,765
Oh. I... didn't know.

453
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,825
I'm sorry.
How long ago was it?

454
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,996
Four years.

455
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:48,029
Sometimes it seems
like a lifetime

456
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:52,408
and sometimes it seems
like just yesterday.

457
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:56,473
If this is too hard,
we can go back to the office

458
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:58,313
and do what you
need to get done.

459
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,613
No, I'm okay.

460
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,086
Let's do that tree.

461
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:04,482
Okay.

462
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:05,490
Right.

463
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:06,616
Um, actually...

464
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,423
So, garland...

465
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,586
...this would be perfect.

466
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:10,686
Yep, okay.

467
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:11,958
This is not gonna take
any time at all.

468
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,465
Oh my gosh.

469
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,627
Hey, what do you
think about this?

470
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:16,692
That's a great call.

471
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:19,329
We can do, like,
you know, on your back.

472
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:20,668
I'm excited about
just getting going, so...

473
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:22,572
I think you're low-key about it.

474
00:22:22,608 --> 00:22:23,632
I'm fired up.

475
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:24,837
Okay. Good.

476
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:31,543
Whoa!
I'm fine.

477
00:22:31,584 --> 00:22:32,745
I can see that.

478
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:34,082
And you will be, too.

479
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,746
Thank you. I mean, this ranch

480
00:22:35,788 --> 00:22:38,450
means the world
to my family and me.

481
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,584
I can see that.

482
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:43,527
Okay. You should do honors.
Here you go.

483
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:44,825
Okay.

484
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:48,932
You were right.

485
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:50,094
It looks amazing.
Thank you.

486
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:51,728
You're welcome.

487
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:54,603
And now there's plenty of time
to go over your expenses.

488
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,075
Wow. Wow.

489
00:22:57,109 --> 00:23:00,670
You jumped back to work mode
so fast, it gives me whiplash.

490
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:16,491
It's been a long time since
I saw snow fall.

491
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:18,553
When was the last time
it snowed in Los Angles?

492
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:20,429
Um, twenty years ago.

493
00:23:20,466 --> 00:23:23,492
Snowed just enough to
make everything white...

494
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:25,799
for about an hour.

495
00:23:25,838 --> 00:23:28,034
Hopefully this'll stick
around a little longer.

496
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:34,708
(sighing)
Let's go.

497
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:39,910
(sighing)

498
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:43,949
Hey.

499
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:45,855
First time seeing snow, huh?

500
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,985
Unless you count
the sledding hill

501
00:23:48,027 --> 00:23:49,722
they made for
the winter dance at school.

502
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:52,026
I don't count that, no.

503
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:55,090
But just wait.

504
00:23:55,134 --> 00:23:56,659
When the snow covers everything
in sight

505
00:23:56,702 --> 00:23:58,830
and the Christmas
lights reflect off of it...

506
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:02,205
in that one, quiet moment,

507
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:06,776
the world is and
new and perfect.

508
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:12,015
I like Montana snow better.

509
00:24:12,051 --> 00:24:13,610
Are these the marshmallows
Pops was talking about?

510
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:16,644
Chloe: Kay let me
and Lexie help.

511
00:24:16,689 --> 00:24:18,214
And then, she taught
us how to knit.

512
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,947
Wow!
You have been busy!

513
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:21,653
What are you knitting?

514
00:24:21,694 --> 00:24:24,925
Atiny little
Christmas scarf.

515
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,864
Sara: Kay, thank you
for keeping her so busy.

516
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:29,630
I think I had
more fun than they did.

517
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:31,762
Did you two get a lot done?

518
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:39,637
I'm just getting
a feel for the place.

519
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:41,510
Well, in that case,

520
00:24:41,547 --> 00:24:42,981
I hope you can stay for
lunch in a couple hours.

521
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:44,847
Mom, can we stay?

522
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:47,909
Well, just as long as there's no
talking business at the table.

523
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:50,786
Well, then, we're going to have
to talk about it before lunch.

524
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:52,086
There's just enough time for me

525
00:24:52,124 --> 00:24:54,525
to go through your
most recent balance sheet.

526
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,619
{blowing raspberry)

527
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:57,925
Oh, can I go visit
the horses while you guys work?

528
00:24:57,963 --> 00:24:58,930
Go ahead.

529
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:00,090
Can I go too?

530
00:25:00,132 --> 00:25:01,725
Funny.

531
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:03,929
{Chloe chuckling)

532
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:08,271
Let's go.

533
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,838
Ranching is actually
a lot more high-tech

534
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:15,278
than most people think.

535
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,040
With GPS, I can see where every
single head of cattle is

536
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:19,608
on a screen at one time.

537
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:21,517
This is not what I expected
your office to look like.

538
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:25,046
One second.

539
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,582
How about now?

540
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:29,253
Yes.
That's what was missing.

541
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:30,728
You know, I have
never met anyone

542
00:25:30,763 --> 00:25:32,857
as into Christmas as you.

543
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:35,299
Making up for lost time.

544
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:38,868
I think when I left the ranch,
I left Christmas behind, too.

545
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:40,269
Where did you go?

546
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:43,265
Law school.

547
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:45,276
You're a lawyer?

548
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,904
Was, yeah. I was pretty good
at it, too.

549
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:50,313
But itwasn't
what I was looking for.

550
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,210
What were you looking for?

551
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:54,310
Something different.

552
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,214
I mean, haven't you ever
wanted a change

553
00:25:56,255 --> 00:25:57,950
just to see if that's
where you were meant to be?

554
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,719
Not really.

555
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:01,692
The reason I'm up
for a promotion

556
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:04,162
is because I stayed the course,
I rose up through the ranks.

557
00:26:04,196 --> 00:26:06,563
There's something
to be said for stability.

558
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:09,260
Yes, there is,
and I had that in New York.

559
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:11,235
But after a few years,

560
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:14,103
I just had to admit
that I wasn't happy.

561
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:17,109
I missed everything
single thing about this place,

562
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:18,837
especially at Christmas.

563
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,743
You missed Christmas
in New York City,

564
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:22,247
the most Christmassy
place in the world?

565
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:24,807
ltwasn't home.

566
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:29,280
Sometimes home is the hardest
place to be at Christmas.

567
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:32,586
Hmm.

568
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:35,150
Well, in that case,

569
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:39,688
I hope that someday you can
bring Christmas home again.

570
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:44,192
I'll show you our
balance sheets.

571
00:26:53,245 --> 00:26:58,046
Okay, anything on
a green plate is vegetarian.

572
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:00,177
That is so thoughtful.
Thank you.

573
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:03,018
Oh, thank Kay -
she put it together.

574
00:27:03,055 --> 00:27:05,683
Amazing in
the kitchen, this one.

575
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:08,352
Yeah, when Kay's not around,
things aren't quite as gourmet.

576
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:10,828
I don't know
why I picture ranchers

577
00:27:10,863 --> 00:27:13,264
eating beans out of a tin pot.

578
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,824
What? That is a cliché
from a bad movie.

579
00:27:15,868 --> 00:27:18,200
Son, remind me

580
00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:19,796
what we had for
supper last night?

581
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:23,200
Beans.

582
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,771
Straight out of the pot.

583
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:29,907
(all chuckling)

584
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:32,974
While you picture
ranchers eating beans,

585
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:37,046
I picture people from LA
eating kale, like all the time.

586
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:39,751
Well, I guess we both have
certain misconceptions.

587
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,422
Mom, you had kale
chips on the plane.

588
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:47,292
- Shh...
- (all laughing)

589
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:50,358
So, Chloe, what do you think
of the ranch so far?

590
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:53,770
Um, it's pretty cool.

591
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:56,240
Trust me.
This is high praise.

592
00:27:56,275 --> 00:28:00,439
You are here at
the best time of the year.

593
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,841
Some of the fondest
memories of my life

594
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:06,010
are from Christmas
on this ranch.

595
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:07,450
Me, too, Dad.

596
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,313
(chuckling)

597
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,947
In fact, I get just as
excited for Christmas now

598
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:12,081
as I did when I was a kid.

599
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:13,785
When I was a kid,

600
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:16,260
I loved that moment of seeing
the Christmas tree all lit up,

601
00:28:16,295 --> 00:28:19,287
Christmas Eve,
right before Santa came,

602
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:24,201
and I just wished that feeling
could last forever.

603
00:28:24,236 --> 00:28:27,433
I know exactly how you feel.

604
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,802
What about you, Chloe?

605
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:33,937
What's your favorite
Christmas memory?

606
00:28:36,248 --> 00:28:37,943
Um...

607
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:42,079
just..spending time
with family.

608
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:47,088
That's my favorite part, too.

609
00:28:49,361 --> 00:28:51,728
Travis: My absolutely favorite
thing about Christmas

610
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:53,356
is actually
happening tonight,

611
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,765
it's the Carson Ranch
Christmas bonfire,

612
00:28:55,801 --> 00:29:00,398
sort of a gigantic campout
with family and friends,

613
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:04,069
and it's just... joyful.

614
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:06,134
I hope you and
Chloe will join us.

615
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:07,441
You better save them

616
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:08,810
front row seats in
front of the fire.

617
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:10,406
It's going to be
in the low-20's tonight.

618
00:29:10,449 --> 00:29:12,110
Oh, yeah, that's right.

619
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,515
You guys aren't
equipped for this.

620
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,151
(sighing)

621
00:29:15,187 --> 00:29:17,087
So, Chloe, I don't think
we have much choice.

622
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:18,817
Either with stay indoors

623
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:20,791
while I finish my work
and we fly back to LA,

624
00:29:20,826 --> 00:29:22,954
or we go into town and we
get ourselves some new coats.

625
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:26,158
I vote coats.

626
00:29:26,198 --> 00:29:29,828
Well, the snow's coming down
pretty hard. If you want,

627
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:32,462
I can give you a lift into town,

628
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:34,404
Oh, you don't need to do that.

629
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:37,773
Have-- have you
ever driven in the snow?

630
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:41,074
We barely drive in the rain.

631
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:42,877
(all laughing)

632
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:56,085
I

633
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:12,435
I don't know about this coat.

634
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,377
Here, try this one.

635
00:30:14,413 --> 00:30:16,006
Ooh.

636
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:17,982
How does anyone
move around in these?

637
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:20,280
Ah, you figure it out.

638
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,083
I'm never taking it off.

639
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,349
Excellent.

640
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:24,913
Actually, I like it.

641
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:27,050
Feels like I'm wrapped in a
thousand fuzzy blankets.

642
00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:29,151
We'll take these.

643
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,862
So, back to the ranch?

644
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:35,424
Uh, no. We have
one more errand to run.

645
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:36,457
Merry Christmas.

646
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:37,866
Oh, merry Christmas.

647
00:30:37,903 --> 00:30:39,029
Merry Christmas.

648
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:40,197
Merry Christmas.

649
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:41,899
You can't possibly
know all these people.

650
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,931
Oh, I don't.
Don't know that guy.

651
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:46,603
Oh. No, wait. I do.
Merry Christmas, Stan!

652
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,314
(chuckling)

653
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:52,045
All right, load up.
You know what they say -

654
00:30:52,084 --> 00:30:53,074
Cold hands, cold head--

655
00:30:53,118 --> 00:30:54,608
Cold heart?

656
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:58,050
No. Just put it on or
you'll be super cold.

657
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:00,616
Here you go.
Merry Christmas.

658
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:01,951
Oh. Oh, that's a hard pass.

659
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:03,427
You can't say no. It's a gift.

660
00:31:03,462 --> 00:31:05,521
- Then, thank you.
- You're welcome.

661
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:06,588
Oh...

662
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:08,998
Oh my goodness.

663
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:11,332
Oh. Oh, you're killing me.

664
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,031
I think it's awesome.

665
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:14,596
Thank you very much
for this hat.

666
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:16,403
Oh, look what I found.

667
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:17,602
No way.

668
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:19,167
Turnaround is fair play.

669
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:20,372
Adorable.

670
00:31:20,412 --> 00:31:21,345
- It's awful.
- What about me?

671
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,348
- Thank you.
- What about me?

672
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:24,440
Oh. Take this guy.

673
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:26,247
Oh, thank you.

674
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:27,877
Ooh, I actually
look cute.

675
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,388
Travis: You do!
That's disappointing.

676
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:31,355
(chuckling)

677
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,119
Oh, that's horrifying.

678
00:31:33,158 --> 00:31:34,421
- Truly.
- It's the worst.

679
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:36,257
Oh, I actually really
like these, though.

680
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:37,455
Oh, can I get them?

681
00:31:37,496 --> 00:31:38,657
Cool. Yeah, we can get these.

682
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,058
- I'll get you some mittens.
- Thank you.

683
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:41,190
Sweet.

684
00:31:42,968 --> 00:31:44,129
Thank you.

685
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:46,160
Thank you.

686
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:48,104
Slow down!

687
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,608
Does she always
walk so fast?

688
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:52,008
Yep. There's nothing she
hates more than a stroll.

689
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:53,533
Not when there's
so much to do.

690
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,342
I've been researching
regenerative soil techniques,

691
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,644
modernization, and there's just
a lot to think about.

692
00:31:57,682 --> 00:31:59,309
You really do care, huh?

693
00:31:59,351 --> 00:32:00,546
I told you I did.

694
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,110
Oh, we have one
more thing to get.

695
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:03,349
Boots?

696
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:04,981
Boots.

697
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:06,149
Boots.

698
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,231
(chattering, cheering)

699
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:16,633
Let's pass these around.

700
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:20,127
Oh, Chloe,
this is my mom and dad.

701
00:32:20,172 --> 00:32:21,367
Hi, Chloe.

702
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:23,135
Hi.
It's great to meet you.

703
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:24,233
Yeah, you, too.

704
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:25,505
Let's go roast these.

705
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:28,241
Have fun.

706
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,078
You know, you could make
a lot of extra income

707
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:32,140
by selling this, right?

708
00:32:32,184 --> 00:32:34,414
That's not what
Christmas is about.

709
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:37,252
We're not gonna take
money from my friends.

710
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,522
I get it.

711
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,027
What?

712
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,529
Why this is your favorite thing.

713
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:47,692
Everyone is just out
celebrating.

714
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:50,531
Nobody's rushing,
nobody's stressed.

715
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:53,470
It's like everyone pressed
‘pause' for the night.

716
00:32:53,505 --> 00:32:55,530
You can do it, too.

717
00:32:55,574 --> 00:32:57,736
I can't seem
to get out of fast forward.

718
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:01,139
Give ittime.
You'll figure it out.

719
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:03,978
I'm don't think
we'll be here long enough.

720
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:06,507
Hi. Well, it's almost time
for Christmas carols.

721
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:10,010
So, what is your favorite?

722
00:33:10,055 --> 00:33:11,545
Uh... I don't know.

723
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,080
We already did "Jingle Bells"
with the horse.

724
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:15,593
So, maybe "Deck the Halls?"

725
00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:18,221
Done.
That would've been my pick.

726
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:20,659
Travis.

727
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:22,133
Hey! Oh, hey.

728
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:23,464
Um, Sara and Chloe Bradley,

729
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:24,628
this is my
good friend Stephen.

730
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,467
He runs the best
restaurant in Big Fork.

731
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:27,666
Pleasure, ma'am.

732
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:31,142
Sara is the financial
advisor from California.

733
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:34,305
Oh. Well, I could've guessed
you weren't from around here.

734
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:35,472
How?

735
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,209
Uh...

736
00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:38,444
New duds.

737
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:40,178
Travis, I can't believe
you let me walk around

738
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:41,583
with that tag inside
my jacket this whole time!

739
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,679
No, I didn't notice! I swear!
I promise. I promise.

740
00:33:43,722 --> 00:33:45,315
Do you want to go
see the marshmallow roast?

741
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:47,155
I would love to.

742
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:48,250
Nice to meet you.

743
00:33:48,293 --> 00:33:49,260
Stephen: Likewise.

744
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:55,791
Haven't seen
that look in your eye

745
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,160
since you moved back from NYC.

746
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:58,260
Oh, stop.

747
00:33:58,303 --> 00:34:00,533
I'm just saying,
it's nice to see.

748
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:13,048
(sighing)

749
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:15,416
This is perfect.

750
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:16,511
It sure is.

Everything okay?

762
00:35:08,173 --> 00:35:09,607
I'm just frustrated.

763
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:11,336
I thought, once I got here,

764
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:13,435
a solution for the ranch
would just come to me.

765
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:14,775
It usually does.

766
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:17,373
Well, your first problem is

767
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:18,678
is there's nothing's
quick Big Fork.

768
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:22,580
And the second is
you should be at the ranch

769
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:24,783
for your inspiration, not here.

770
00:35:24,823 --> 00:35:27,224
Now, go, get some sleep.

771
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:29,693
I'll drive you out
in the morning.

772
00:35:29,728 --> 00:35:32,527
That's so nice.
Thank you.

773
00:35:32,564 --> 00:35:33,861
Think nothing of it.

774
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:44,867
- Pops: Hey!
- Sara: Hil

775
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:46,673
Hello! Good morning!

776
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:48,509
Hey, Pops.

777
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:50,708
So, how are you
fixed for egg nog?

778
00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:52,581
Running a little low.

779
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:56,679
Any chance you could find some
time to whip up another batch?

780
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:58,689
Kay:
Well, I can make time.

781
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:00,191
Hey, Lexie.

782
00:36:00,225 --> 00:36:02,159
Hey, Chloe.
I like your boots.

783
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:04,719
Thank you. They're new.

784
00:36:04,763 --> 00:36:07,528
Would you girls like to
help me with the egg nog?

785
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:08,657
- Yes!
- Sure!

786
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,498
Okay, first, though,
we need some eggs.

787
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,429
Uh, where you going?

788
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:14,870
Kitchen's that way.

789
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:17,170
Yeah, but the eggs
are back there.

790
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:19,905
Oh, I don't think
I could do that.

791
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:21,503
You were great with the horses.

792
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:24,345
The chickens are
even easier. Come on.

793
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:26,646
Sara: Have fun.

794
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:28,779
{Kay chuckling)

795
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:31,414
I'm just gonna have
a look around the ranch.

796
00:36:33,258 --> 00:36:37,889
(lowing)

797
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:42,833
(lowing)

798
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:50,836
(chuckling)

799
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,809
-Woman: Hey.
- Man: How you doing?

800
00:36:52,844 --> 00:36:54,209
Hi.

801
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:56,577
(chattering)

802
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:15,460
Wow,
this place is coming along.

803
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,867
Yeah. Only four days
till Christmas Eve.

804
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:20,496
Come on!

805
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:23,508
Hey!
Snowball fights outside only.

806
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:24,804
And no sneak attacks.

807
00:37:24,843 --> 00:37:26,470
Sorry, Dad.
Come on, guys.

808
00:37:26,511 --> 00:37:28,001
Chloe: Hey!

809
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:31,011
Sorry about that, ma'am.
Kids are on break.

810
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,944
Oh, J.T. Ryan -
head ranch hand.

811
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:34,816
Sara Bradley.
Nice to meet you.

812
00:37:34,853 --> 00:37:38,448
I better go give
Teddy some backup.

813
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:41,425
Would you do me a favor and
help me unbox these plates?

814
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:42,824
Sure.

815
00:37:42,861 --> 00:37:45,592
It's amazing to see the whole
town enjoying your ranch.

816
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,758
That's what
Christmas is all about.

817
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,768
I can see that.

818
00:37:51,903 --> 00:37:53,393
These are beautiful.

819
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:55,338
Thank you.
Some of them were my mom's,

820
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:56,898
passed down from
three generations before that.

821
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,466
I bet she'd be proud

822
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,875
to know that you're
keeping up the tradition.

823
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:02,812
Yeah. You know,
that's what I missed

824
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:04,440
when I was in New York.

825
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:06,382
It's the things that make
Christmas personal

826
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:08,476
are the things that you
look forward to the most.

827
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,646
You know?

828
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:11,781
For me and Chloe,

829
00:38:11,823 --> 00:38:13,882
Christmas just became
something to get through

830
00:38:13,925 --> 00:38:15,916
instead of something
to celebrate.

831
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,487
Have you ever spoken to her
about how things used to be?

832
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:23,468
I've tried.
It just gets her upset.

833
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:25,333
I'm sorry.

834
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:26,531
That's none of my business.

835
00:38:26,571 --> 00:38:28,061
I just know how healing
it was for me

836
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,832
to keep my mother's
traditions alive,

837
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:32,900
especially not being able to
get back when she was sick...

838
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:37,040
and then everything
happened so... quickly

839
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:38,913
I wasn't ready.

840
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,543
I don't think anybody is.

841
00:38:40,585 --> 00:38:42,815
Your whole life
changes in an instant.

842
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:44,982
That's true.

843
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:48,857
And the way my parents
loved each other, I mean,

844
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:52,523
that's how I pictured Christmas
was gonna be with family.

845
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:54,760
I think you'll be
a wonderful father someday.

846
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:57,097
You connect so easily to kids.

847
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,804
Thank you.

848
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:07,342
And Chloe makes it easy.
She's a great kid.

849
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:10,837
She is lighter here,
more connected.

850
00:39:10,882 --> 00:39:13,783
That's what's great about life
here is connecting with people,

851
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:16,947
you know,
sitting together, talking.

852
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:18,456
We take the time,

853
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:21,049
and enjoy the journey
as much as the destination.

854
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:22,617
And I'm always too busy

855
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,992
finding my fastest way
to the destination.

856
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,929
You are working
hard to provide

857
00:39:26,965 --> 00:39:29,991
a great life for Chloe,
and you're doing a great job.

858
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,662
Yeah. There's nothing
more important to me.

859
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:35,401
She needs to know
we're going to be okay.

860
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,501
She's lucky to
have a mom like you.

861
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:41,376
{footsteps approaching)

862
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:42,937
(chuckling)

863
00:39:42,981 --> 00:39:44,915
Teddy turned on me.

864
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:46,781
(chuckling)

865
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:49,583
Oh, I'll be back after the crew
and I feed the stock.

866
00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:51,953
Let me know if
you need anything.

867
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,048
Will do.

868
00:39:53,091 --> 00:39:54,456
(chuckling)

869
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:55,982
He's nice.

870
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:57,995
Yeah,
he's like a brother to me.

871
00:39:58,029 --> 00:40:00,999
His dad worked here,
too, back in the day.

872
00:40:01,032 --> 00:40:04,696
Alot of our ranch hands are
second, even third generation.

873
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:06,670
I can see why Peter's
recommendations

874
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:08,069
weren't going to work.

875
00:40:08,106 --> 00:40:10,598
I'm glad you understand.

876
00:40:10,642 --> 00:40:13,577
I do.

877
00:40:20,485 --> 00:40:22,749
- (bell ringing)
- (cows lowing)

878
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:24,585
Oh. Must be time to go.

879
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:25,680
Where?

880
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:27,088
Back to the house.

881
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:30,527
First rule of ranch life,
never ignore the chow bell.

882
00:40:32,864 --> 00:40:36,494
(chuckling)

883
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:38,628
Hey. We heard the bell.
What's cooking?

884
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:42,698
Presenting Chloe
and Lexie's secret--

885
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,707
Both: Super secret.

886
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:47,769
--Super secret recipe egg nog.

887
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:49,644
There you go.

888
00:40:49,681 --> 00:40:51,513
Thank you.

889
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:54,981
Thank you.

890
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:58,580
Oh, look, I puta cinnamon
stick in, like Dad used to.

891
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:00,182
You remember that?

892
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:03,125
I remember everything.

893
00:41:03,161 --> 00:41:04,959
{phone ringing)

894
00:41:04,996 --> 00:41:06,987
Oh. Excuse me. Here.

895
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:08,521
Sure.

896
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:09,727
I get some, too.

897
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:10,928
Fair enough.

898
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:13,563
(all laughing)

899
00:41:15,006 --> 00:41:16,565
I know, Peter.

900
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:18,132
But it's different
once you see it in person.

901
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:20,577
There are just a lot of
moving parts to consider.

902
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:22,773
Well, if you can't come up with
an alternate solution,

903
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,782
you need to help
him do what he has to do.

904
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:28,946
Did you send me here to try to
talk him into laying people off?

905
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:31,217
Well, of course not.
I sent you there

906
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:32,950
because we're trying to help
one of our oldest clients

907
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:34,049
hang onto his legacy.

908
00:41:34,092 --> 00:41:36,561
But you only got
three more left, Sara.

909
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:37,993
At some point,

910
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:39,895
you're going to have to tell
them the same thing I did.

911
00:41:39,931 --> 00:41:42,662
I still have time. Bye.

912
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,226
Everything okay?

913
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:46,759
It will be.

914
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:50,104
I know there's a lot
riding on all this for everyone.

915
00:41:50,141 --> 00:41:52,940
Well, we appreciate
you trying to find

916
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:54,809
a different way to
make the loan happen.

917
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:56,780
Yeah, I'm doing my best.

918
00:41:56,814 --> 00:41:59,146
It would be a lot easier
if I didn't care so much...

919
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:05,989
...about the ranch, and your
family, and the traditions.

920
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:07,890
I didn't expect that.

921
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:11,259
I didn't expect that either.

922
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:13,593
I've got an idea.

923
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,962
What?

924
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:17,195
Nothing clears
the head like a long ride,

925
00:42:17,235 --> 00:42:19,727
and at Christmas time,
it's even better.

926
00:42:19,771 --> 00:42:21,068
You ever been on a horse?

927
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:23,164
Does sitting on a pony

928
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:26,006
walking around in a circle
when you're five count?

929
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:27,876
No. No, it doesn't.
But don't worry.

930
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:29,607
welll find the
right horse for you.

931
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:30,773
It's always good to match

932
00:42:30,815 --> 00:42:32,874
a rider's personality
with a horse.

933
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:36,615
Sara, this is Liberty.

934
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:40,215
Smartas a whip,
fiercely loyal

935
00:42:40,258 --> 00:42:42,886
and has a heart of gold.

936
00:42:50,201 --> 00:42:51,327
Hello.

937
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:59,338
Sara: Do I really
have to wear this thing?

938
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,842
Yes. Safety first.
Now, come on. I'll leg you up.

939
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,109
You'll what me up?

940
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:06,981
You use my hands as a stool,
I give you a boost,

941
00:43:07,018 --> 00:43:08,952
then you throw your other leg
over the back of the horse.

942
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:11,353
Don't worry about it.
I'll be right here.

943
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,579
- Okay.
- Okay.

944
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:13,784
- Okay.
- All right?

945
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,221
Yeah.

946
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,730
No, wait. Okay.
Okay, okay.

947
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:21,323
- I'm right here.
- All right.

948
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:23,265
You want to try that again?

949
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:24,666
Yeah. Yeah.
I don't give up so easily.

950
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:25,897
Okay.

951
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:27,098
Okay.

952
00:43:27,138 --> 00:43:28,697
Ready?

953
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:29,968
- Whoo!
- Perfect!

954
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:31,236
- 1 did it.
- Great job.

955
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,242
- Okay.
- Great job! Oh!

956
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:33,744
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

957
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:35,246
You just-- you squeezed
your legs together a little.

958
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,111
- To her, that means "go."
- Okay.

959
00:43:37,148 --> 00:43:38,912
Now, just use the reins, right?

960
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:41,078
Right, left -
it's like driving a car.

961
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,382
All right. Oh, yeah.
I got this.

962
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,917
- Okay.
- Sara: I got it.

963
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:46,322
You're doing great.

964
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:50,249
{clicking tongue)

965
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,854
(horse whinnying)

966
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:04,404
{sighing contentedly)
This is great.

967
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,132
You're a natural.

968
00:44:06,177 --> 00:44:08,669
Oh, I didn't say go!
I didn't do the leg thing!

969
00:44:08,713 --> 00:44:10,306
Don't worry. You're going
in the right direction.

970
00:44:10,348 --> 00:44:11,406
I got your back.

971
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:22,089
I

972
00:44:23,294 --> 00:44:24,261
That was amazing.

973
00:44:24,295 --> 00:44:25,262
It was fun, right?

974
00:44:25,296 --> 00:44:26,286
Yeah.

975
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:27,320
You're a natural.

976
00:44:27,365 --> 00:44:28,696
Thank you.

977
00:44:28,733 --> 00:44:29,894
Thanks, Luke.

978
00:44:33,738 --> 00:44:36,105
Chloe: Mom!
I've been taking photos.

979
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,302
You know how to ride a horse?

980
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:42,006
It was more like walking a
horse, but I suppose, yes.

981
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:44,037
You want to learn how?

982
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:46,345
So, we could go riding
together someday?

983
00:44:46,384 --> 00:44:47,909
I would love that.

984
00:44:50,955 --> 00:44:53,890
Hey, Neil.
Hey, kids. Merry Christmas.

985
00:44:53,925 --> 00:44:57,259
Merry Christmas,
and thanks again.

986
00:44:57,295 --> 00:44:58,922
Qur pleasure.

987
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:02,390
Oh, that's the Hayes family.

988
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:04,993
They get their tree
from us every year.

989
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:07,403
Hmm. I'll see
you guys at the house.

990
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:09,031
- See ya, sweetie.
- Okay.

991
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:10,837
You didn't mention you were
running a Christmas tree lot.

992
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:12,240
Well, we aren't.

993
00:45:12,276 --> 00:45:13,971
But I invite people to get
their trees from us every year.

994
00:45:14,011 --> 00:45:15,172
And you don't charge for that.

995
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:16,806
Well, no. That'd be
like me charging you

996
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:18,747
for riding lessons.

997
00:45:18,783 --> 00:45:21,480
I mean, I realize it's
not a huge income stream,

998
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,153
but every little bit helps.

999
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:24,450
Well, tell you what,

1000
00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:25,922
if you come up with us
to get our tree tonight,

1001
00:45:25,957 --> 00:45:28,085
I will charge you for the honor.

1002
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:30,389
You're joking, but you're
actually onto something.

1003
00:45:30,428 --> 00:45:32,328
Am I?

1004
00:45:32,363 --> 00:45:35,355
So, why do you wait so long
to cut down your tree?

1005
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,231
Well, my dad couldn't take any
time off work

1006
00:45:37,268 --> 00:45:38,827
until a couple days
before Christmas,

1007
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:40,837
so we'd save up all the
decorating until then.

1008
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:43,806
and I guess it just
became a tradition.

1009
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:47,141
Seems like everything around
here becomes a tradition.

1010
00:45:47,178 --> 00:45:49,203
Well, when you find
something special,

1011
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:51,807
you try to keep it around.

1012
00:45:56,787 --> 00:45:58,915
(Sara exhaling deeply)

1013
00:45:58,956 --> 00:46:01,152
Oh, it's beautiful out here.

1014
00:46:01,192 --> 00:46:04,218
I mean, it's like a
show globe come to life.

1015
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:06,924
It's like what everyone thinks
Christmas should look like.

1016
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:08,989
Merry Christmas!

1017
00:46:09,033 --> 00:46:11,502
How can you do this every year
without losing all your trees?

1018
00:46:11,535 --> 00:46:14,129
Well, we plant two for every
one that someone takes.

1019
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:16,071
I mean, that's what ranching is,
its cyclical,

1020
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:17,404
everything has
atime and a place,

1021
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,535
and everything we do now
matters for the future.

1022
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:21,211
Come on, come on.
Less talking, more looking

1023
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:22,406
Okay.

1024
00:46:28,853 --> 00:46:31,015
(chuckling)

1025
00:46:31,055 --> 00:46:33,149
How ‘bout that one?

1026
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:35,420
Ehh. It's a good
Charlie Brown Christmas tree.

1027
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,427
Or how ‘bout that one?

1028
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:41,989
welll find
one for you.

1029
00:46:42,033 --> 00:46:43,364
This is the one.

1030
00:46:43,401 --> 00:46:45,426
That's a great one.
You've got a good eye.

1031
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:49,096
Here you go.

1032
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,539
You want me to do it?

1033
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:53,043
It's all a part of the Christmas
in Montana experience, yeah.

1034
00:46:55,346 --> 00:46:57,246
I suppose it is.

1035
00:46:57,281 --> 00:46:58,214
Okay.

1036
00:46:58,249 --> 00:46:59,341
Come on, Mom, let's doit.

1037
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:02,080
Okay. Just watch out, sweetie.

1038
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:04,144
I'll get that bottom
branches first.

1039
00:47:04,188 --> 00:47:05,451
All right.

1040
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:10,184
Okay.

1041
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:11,388
Okay, let ‘er go.

1042
00:47:11,429 --> 00:47:13,420
Three, two, one!

1043
00:47:13,464 --> 00:47:15,592
Timber! Whoo!

1044
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,062
(laughing)

1045
00:47:17,101 --> 00:47:18,933
All right,
let's get ‘er home.

1046
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:20,061
All right.

1047
00:47:20,104 --> 00:47:21,503
Travis: Nice cut.

1048
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:23,598
- You just did that.
- I know!

1049
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,070
I didn't see that.
Oh, should we help you?

1050
00:47:25,109 --> 00:47:26,099
- Sure.
- Okay.

1051
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:27,076
Come on.

1052
00:47:27,111 --> 00:47:28,078
Grab an end.
Let's go.

1053
00:47:28,112 --> 00:47:29,102
This is heavier
than I thought.

1054
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:30,272
Chloe: Oh, yeah, it totally is.

1055
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:31,509
You're doing great.

1056
00:47:31,549 --> 00:47:32,573
Oh my gosh.
That's really heavy.

1057
00:47:35,086 --> 00:47:37,919
Kay: You know, why don't
you put that one right there?

1058
00:47:37,955 --> 00:47:41,585
I think that'll look nice.

1059
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:44,219
Every member of the family,
going back for generations,

1060
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:47,253
has an ornament
with their name on it,

1061
00:47:47,298 --> 00:47:50,495
and they all go on the tree.

1062
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:54,971
Including friends
who become family.

1063
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:56,166
(gasping)

1064
00:47:58,609 --> 00:48:01,169
I have the perfect place for it.

1065
00:48:03,481 --> 00:48:04,880
Kay: Thank you.

1066
00:48:04,915 --> 00:48:06,349
It's a beautiful tradition.

1067
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:10,321
And now, you're a part
of it, too.

1068
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,922
Thank you.

1069
00:48:13,958 --> 00:48:17,986
Around here,
when people help each other,

1070
00:48:18,028 --> 00:48:19,553
they become family.

1071
00:48:19,597 --> 00:48:23,158
We know you're doing
everything you can to help us.

1072
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,668
Well, you've helped us, too,

1073
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:27,667
more than you know.

1074
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:33,500
I wish dad could see this.

1075
00:48:33,544 --> 00:48:35,103
He can.

1076
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:46,349
Wow,
it's so pretty.

1077
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:52,528
Oh...

1078
00:48:55,065 --> 00:48:56,191
Here you go.

1079
00:48:56,233 --> 00:48:59,533
Thank you.

1080
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:02,005
(sighing)

1081
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:05,134
It's freezing out here.
Don't you want to go inside?

1082
00:49:05,176 --> 00:49:08,476
I actually like the cold -
it helps me think.

1083
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:09,570
Who knew?

1084
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:12,674
I did, of course.

1085
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:16,984
This place is incredible.

1086
00:49:17,021 --> 00:49:20,616
I've never seen Christmas
brought to life like this.

1087
00:49:20,658 --> 00:49:22,524
I'd like to think

1088
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:26,019
it's all about who you
experience it with.

1089
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:28,532
Well, I'm glad it's with you.

1090
00:49:30,201 --> 00:49:32,101
And your family, of course.

1091
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:34,537
Of course.

1092
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:42,578
Did you pay someone to do that?

1093
00:49:42,613 --> 00:49:45,275
(chuckling)
It's the Ursids meteor shower.

1094
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:46,545
It's peaking tonight.

1095
00:49:46,584 --> 00:49:47,983
I thought it was gonna be
cloudy,

1096
00:49:48,018 --> 00:49:49,508
but it's clear as can be.

1097
00:49:49,553 --> 00:49:51,612
It's amazing.

1098
00:49:54,391 --> 00:49:56,587
Do you think Chloe'd
like to see this?

1099
00:49:56,627 --> 00:49:58,288
I'll go get her.

1100
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:19,178
I have never seen
a meteor shower before.

1101
00:50:19,216 --> 00:50:21,685
All the city lights
get in the way?

1102
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:24,518
That, and
I was never patient enough.

1103
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:30,521
Oh, there's a big one
right there. Make a wish.

1104
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:49,802
I

1105
00:50:55,185 --> 00:51:02,091
I

1106
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:05,495
Pops: Hey, thanks for
doing the dishes, guys.

1107
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:08,624
It's literally the least I could
do after such a wonderful day.

1108
00:51:08,666 --> 00:51:10,634
Ava.

1109
00:51:10,668 --> 00:51:12,397
Look at her.

1110
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:14,564
After Kay left,
she put her head down

1111
00:51:14,605 --> 00:51:18,166
and fell asleep
in, like, ten seconds.

1112
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:20,802
I love how tired she is at the
end of a day on the ranch,

1113
00:51:20,844 --> 00:51:23,313
and she's never seemed happier.

1114
00:51:23,347 --> 00:51:26,317
It's funny, that's what she said
the same thing about you.

1115
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:31,454
Hey, Chlo',
you ready to go back to the inn?

1116
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:35,222
No.

1117
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:38,092
I think she's down
for the count.

1118
00:51:38,128 --> 00:51:41,291
Yeah. So, just stay.

1119
00:51:41,332 --> 00:51:42,663
You can take
the extra couch.

1120
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:45,362
We got plenty of blankets.

1121
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:49,703
And in the morning,
we can have a big breakfast.

1122
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:51,333
- And then...
- Both: We can get to work.

1123
00:51:51,375 --> 00:51:53,434
Oh, beat you to it that time.

1124
00:51:57,648 --> 00:52:07,615
I

1125
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:22,265
Do you have
everything you need?

1126
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:23,467
I think so.

1127
00:52:23,507 --> 00:52:27,239
Okay, well, just in case.

1128
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:30,808
It gets cold.

1129
00:52:30,848 --> 00:52:31,838
Thank you.

1130
00:52:31,882 --> 00:52:33,247
Sure.

1131
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:43,850
Night.

1132
00:52:43,894 --> 00:52:45,487
Good night.

1133
00:52:49,233 --> 00:53:01,271
I

1134
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:09,312
I was hoping you were
gonna be here this morning.

1135
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:11,287
Well, you can't have breakfast

1136
00:53:11,321 --> 00:53:14,188
without my famous cinnamon
rolls, now, can you?

1137
00:53:14,224 --> 00:53:16,716
No, we cannot!

1138
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:19,354
(chuckling)

1139
00:53:19,396 --> 00:53:21,922
Okay, let's dig in.

1140
00:53:21,965 --> 00:53:23,455
Hey!

1141
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:26,367
What? They're delicious.

1142
00:53:26,403 --> 00:53:28,735
Well, don'ttell anyone,
they're from a can.

1143
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:30,240
What?

1144
00:53:30,274 --> 00:53:32,265
No way.

1145
00:53:33,811 --> 00:53:37,475
Okay, they're homemade.

1146
00:53:37,514 --> 00:53:38,709
(all laughing)

1147
00:53:38,749 --> 00:53:40,774
Kay: I just didn't want
your dad to overdo it.

1148
00:53:40,818 --> 00:53:42,547
Hey, I'll skip lunch.

1149
00:53:42,586 --> 00:53:44,418
(all laughing)

1150
00:53:44,455 --> 00:53:47,618
So, did you sleep okay?

1151
00:53:47,658 --> 00:53:50,889
Better than
I have in a long time.

1152
00:53:50,928 --> 00:53:53,954
You know, as long as
a Carson owns this ranch,

1153
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:56,864
you have an invitation
for breakfast anytime.

1154
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,800
I better get back
to the B&B soon,

1155
00:53:58,836 --> 00:54:00,702
so I can make sure a Carson does
own this ranch,

1156
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:02,900
now and in the future.

1157
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:04,465
But can we at least stop

1158
00:54:04,508 --> 00:54:05,873
at the Christmas market
on the way back?

1159
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:07,877
Yeah, sure.

1160
00:54:15,452 --> 00:54:22,950
I

1161
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:27,693
Chloe: Thanks for
taking me, Mom.

1162
00:54:27,731 --> 00:54:29,893
I wanted to pick up some more
yarn for my scarf.

1163
00:54:31,702 --> 00:54:34,262
Alot of yarn.

1164
00:54:34,304 --> 00:54:35,601
I really like this color,

1165
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:37,698
but it's cashmere,
so it's really expensive.

1166
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:39,505
- I got you.
- Actually?

1167
00:54:39,543 --> 00:54:40,738
Mm-hmm.

1168
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:43,907
Thank you.

1169
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,312
Here you go.

1170
00:54:47,885 --> 00:54:49,853
That scarf is going
to be beautiful.

1171
00:54:49,887 --> 00:54:53,346
Thank you. Do you want me to
teach you how to make one?

1172
00:54:54,925 --> 00:54:58,452
I mean,
I know you have to work, so...

1173
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:01,430
Um, Iwill...

1174
00:55:01,465 --> 00:55:03,832
after you teach me to knit.

1175
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:06,461
Okay.

1176
00:55:06,503 --> 00:55:09,905
Um, so, this is the eighth
row on my Christmas scarf,

1177
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:11,965
and basically,
all you have to do

1178
00:55:12,009 --> 00:55:13,909
is take that...

1179
00:55:13,944 --> 00:55:16,641
and then do that.

1180
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,478
Here, you try it.

1181
00:55:18,515 --> 00:55:19,710
Okay.

1182
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:20,945
Well, do you want
me to help you?

1183
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:22,076
Yes, please.

1184
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:23,753
Okay. So, put the
needle through the loop.

1185
00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:24,754
Mm-hmm.

1186
00:55:24,788 --> 00:55:25,880
- Grab the yarn.
- Yep.

1187
00:55:25,923 --> 00:55:27,084
Pull it through.

1188
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:28,849
- Yep.
- Under stitch.

1189
00:55:28,892 --> 00:55:29,916
Slide it off.

1190
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:32,327
Yeah! You just did
one stitch.

1191
00:55:32,362 --> 00:55:33,625
I'm exhausted.

1192
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:36,065
(chuckling)

1193
00:55:39,636 --> 00:55:41,900
Mom?

1194
00:55:41,939 --> 00:55:46,536
This is the best Christmas
we've had since Dad died.

1195
00:55:46,577 --> 00:55:49,376
I think so, too.

1196
00:55:49,413 --> 00:55:52,576
And do we really have
to leave on the 23rd?

1197
00:55:52,616 --> 00:55:56,553
I mean, that's the deadline.
After that, my work is done.

1198
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:00,824
Well, can't we just
stay for Christmas?

1199
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:04,021
(sighing)

1200
00:56:04,061 --> 00:56:05,790
Sweetie, we can't
invite ourselves

1201
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:07,024
to someone else's Christmas,

1202
00:56:07,064 --> 00:56:09,590
no matter how much
we want to be there.

1203
00:56:11,902 --> 00:56:15,930
And if my recommendation
isthe same as Peter's,

1204
00:56:15,973 --> 00:56:18,874
I doubt I'll be welcome anyway.

1205
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:22,137
Right.

1206
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:23,437
Okay, show me one more time.

1207
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,777
- Okay.
- So, through?

1208
00:56:24,815 --> 00:56:26,078
Yep. Yep.

1209
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:28,084
- Oh, there itis.
- Mm-hmm, and then let go.

1210
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:30,109
- Let go?
- Yep. Just pull it like that.

1211
00:56:30,153 --> 00:56:32,121
- Oh, slide it.
- Yep.

1212
00:56:32,155 --> 00:56:34,123
- Ah. You said "let go."
- Okay, well, slide it.

1213
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:35,625
If I let go,
I just drop it.

1214
00:56:38,795 --> 00:56:48,762
I

1215
00:57:09,726 --> 00:57:12,093
Midnight snack?

1216
00:57:12,129 --> 00:57:14,496
Kay's fruitcake.

1217
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:16,431
I can't get enough
of this stuff.

1218
00:57:16,466 --> 00:57:18,161
Well, no one can say that
you haven't embraced

1219
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:20,693
the Christmas spirit here.

1220
00:57:20,737 --> 00:57:21,932
You have, too.

1221
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,740
You know,
as a matter of fact, I have.

1222
00:57:25,776 --> 00:57:26,937
Oh...

1223
00:57:28,912 --> 00:57:31,813
Mm-hmm.

1224
00:57:34,151 --> 00:57:35,118
Where did you get those?

1225
00:57:35,152 --> 00:57:36,176
In the markets.

1226
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:38,916
I figured, when in Montana...

1227
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:42,449
I love them.
Thank you, Mom.

1228
00:57:42,492 --> 00:57:46,451
{phone ringing)

1229
00:57:46,496 --> 00:57:47,554
Hi, Peter.

1230
00:57:47,597 --> 00:57:48,996
Apologies for the late call.

1231
00:57:49,032 --> 00:57:51,501
I'm, uh--
I'm just concerned.

1232
00:57:51,535 --> 00:57:54,903
Don't worry. You'll have the
report first thing tomorrow.

1233
00:57:54,938 --> 00:57:56,667
Actually, I'm more concerned
about your methodology.

1234
00:57:56,707 --> 00:57:58,175
What do you mean?

1235
00:57:58,208 --> 00:58:00,233
Well, you know that my
granddaughter

1236
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,605
follows your daughter
on social media, right?

1237
00:58:02,646 --> 00:58:04,614
Katie? Sure.

1238
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:07,083
Yeah, they're been friendly
since the company picnic.

1239
00:58:07,117 --> 00:58:09,848
I still am not following.

1240
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:12,548
Well, Katie and I
went out to dinner tonight

1241
00:58:12,589 --> 00:58:14,489
and she showed me Chloe's feed.

1242
00:58:14,524 --> 00:58:17,892
Now, don't get me wrong,
I'm glad you're having fun.

1243
00:58:17,928 --> 00:58:20,920
But I don't know what to think
when I see pictures of you

1244
00:58:20,964 --> 00:58:22,830
decorating a Christmas tree,

1245
00:58:22,866 --> 00:58:26,860
on a horse, singing
Christmas carols by a bonfire.

1246
00:58:26,903 --> 00:58:29,838
I was just doing what
you're always talking about -

1247
00:58:29,873 --> 00:58:31,807
putting people before profits.

1248
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:34,140
Yes, that is what we try to do.

1249
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:36,043
But in the end, the Carsons are
still gonna have to prove

1250
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:38,013
they can afford this loan.

1251
00:58:38,048 --> 00:58:39,812
I'm looking at those pictures,
and I'm wondering

1252
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:42,080
whether they're running
a cattle business

1253
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:51,623
Peter, what is the last possible
minute I can send in my report?

1254
00:58:51,661 --> 00:58:54,187
They'll need time to
review it upstairs, Sara.

1255
00:58:54,231 --> 00:58:56,131
Noon tomorrow,
that's the best I can do.

1256
00:58:56,166 --> 00:58:58,032
That's all I need.

1257
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:01,829
What happened?

1258
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:03,931
You know how much it bugs me

1259
00:59:03,974 --> 00:59:07,137
when you post pictures of
absolutely everything we do.

1260
00:59:07,177 --> 00:59:08,667
Mm-hmm.

1261
00:59:08,712 --> 00:59:11,773
Your doing that might have
just saved this ranch.

1262
00:59:11,815 --> 00:59:12,782
What? How?

1263
00:59:12,816 --> 00:59:13,908
I'll explain later.

1264
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:15,076
But right now,
you need to get some sleep

1265
00:59:15,118 --> 00:59:17,644
and I need to get to work.

1266
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:22,052
Okay.

1267
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:36,337
I

1268
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:53,350
I think you singlehandedly drank

1269
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,354
all the coffee
I had in the entire inn.

1270
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:58,584
I'm sorry.
I just have to keep going.

1271
00:59:58,628 --> 01:00:01,325
Il think I found
the solution for the ranch.

1272
01:00:01,364 --> 01:00:03,696
That's wonderful news!

1273
01:00:03,733 --> 01:00:05,292
Well, I still have
to convince Travis

1274
01:00:05,335 --> 01:00:07,997
and the bank
to agree to my proposal.

1275
01:00:08,038 --> 01:00:09,972
May I see?

1276
01:00:25,722 --> 01:00:28,214
I can't believe nobody's
thought of doing this before.

1277
01:00:28,258 --> 01:00:29,987
Sometimes it takes an outsider

1278
01:00:30,026 --> 01:00:32,324
to see things
from a different angle.

1279
01:00:32,362 --> 01:00:34,091
You're no outsider now.

1280
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:37,761
In fact, I'd say that you're
closer to Travis Carson

1281
01:00:37,801 --> 01:00:40,293
than anyone since he brought
that fiancée back from New York.

1282
01:00:40,337 --> 01:00:42,066
He was engaged?

1283
01:00:42,105 --> 01:00:44,233
Only until the
young lady realized

1284
01:00:44,274 --> 01:00:46,800
she wasn't marrying a lawyer,
she was marrying a rancher.

1285
01:00:46,843 --> 01:00:49,244
He hasn't been
with anyone since.

1286
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:50,804
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

1287
01:00:50,847 --> 01:00:52,315
I would have thought he was

1288
01:00:52,349 --> 01:00:54,750
Big Fork's
most eligible bachelor.

1289
01:00:54,784 --> 01:00:57,014
Everyone here knew
his heart was closed.

1290
01:00:57,053 --> 01:01:01,354
Until now.

1291
01:01:03,727 --> 01:01:06,059
I better go wake
Chloe up and get over there.

1292
01:01:06,096 --> 01:01:08,155
I can't wait to show
this to Travis.

1293
01:01:12,736 --> 01:01:16,229
{cows lowing)

1294
01:01:16,273 --> 01:01:19,834
Well, I was hoping it
wouldn't come to this.

1295
01:01:19,876 --> 01:01:22,277
Well, unless Sara has some
other recommendations,

1296
01:01:22,312 --> 01:01:24,679
this is the only answer.

1297
01:01:24,714 --> 01:01:26,773
Are you sure?

1298
01:01:26,816 --> 01:01:29,877
No, and I hate to
part of our land,

1299
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,252
but it's better than
losing the people we love.

1300
01:01:35,926 --> 01:01:38,156
Both: I need to talk to you.

1301
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:40,425
I'll leave you two. Sara.

1302
01:01:40,463 --> 01:01:43,398
Please, let me go first.

1303
01:01:45,802 --> 01:01:47,429
I'm gonna sell
two thousand acres.

1304
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:50,735
What? But that's ten percent
of your property.

1305
01:01:50,774 --> 01:01:53,368
I know, but this way,
we won't need the loan at all.

1306
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:55,037
Maybe not this year,
but what about the future?

1307
01:01:55,078 --> 01:01:56,842
What if there's another drought?

1308
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,939
This is what
we have to do now.

1309
01:01:58,982 --> 01:02:02,316
But if you listen to what I have
to say, you might never have to.

1310
01:02:02,352 --> 01:02:04,980
Okay.
What are you talking about?

1311
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:06,887
It finally hit me.

1312
01:02:06,923 --> 01:02:10,018
This was never going to work
if we focus on cutting costs.

1313
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:13,030
It's about adding profitability
year in and year out

1314
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:15,760
by monetizing everything you're
already doing for Christmas.

1315
01:02:15,799 --> 01:02:17,062
Oh, we already
talked about this.

1316
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:18,761
That is not what
this ranch is about.

1317
01:02:18,802 --> 01:02:20,361
I'm not gonna charge
my family and friends.

1318
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:21,837
No, you don't need to.

1319
01:02:21,871 --> 01:02:23,862
This is about the people
who would travel here

1320
01:02:23,907 --> 01:02:26,376
to find that classic,

1321
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,969
old-fashioned,
Christmas they're longing for.

1322
01:02:29,012 --> 01:02:30,241
Just-just look at
the proposal, okay?

1323
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,805
- Okay.
- Just let me show it to you.

1324
01:02:31,848 --> 01:02:32,974
All right.

1325
01:02:39,789 --> 01:02:44,522
("We Wish You a
Merry Christmas" playing)

1326
01:02:51,868 --> 01:02:56,806
I

1327
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:01,908
What do you think?

1328
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:03,413
And you're sure
there's a market for this?

1329
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:06,040
I was up all night
doing the research.

1330
01:03:06,082 --> 01:03:08,813
There are already a couple of
ranches upstate doing this.

1331
01:03:10,987 --> 01:03:14,048
And look at what they
charge per week.

1332
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:15,421
Wow!

1333
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:18,428
Now you see why I got
so excited about the idea.

1334
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:22,157
But who'd run it, though?

1335
01:03:22,198 --> 01:03:24,030
I mean, Pops and I
still have to run the ranch.

1336
01:03:24,067 --> 01:03:25,125
Well, you'd have to
hire a manager

1337
01:03:25,168 --> 01:03:27,933
and that is all
laid out in this budget.

1338
01:03:27,971 --> 01:03:29,439
I also worked out
a loan structure

1339
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:32,305
so that you could get the
initial funding to renovate.

1340
01:03:34,511 --> 01:03:38,243
Travis,
"Christmas at Carson Ranch"

1341
01:03:38,281 --> 01:03:41,046
is about giving people
something they're missing -

1342
01:03:41,084 --> 01:03:43,075
a connection to Christmas,

1343
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:45,213
to family, to themselves.

1344
01:03:45,255 --> 01:03:48,555
I know that's what it
did for me and Chloe

1345
01:03:48,591 --> 01:03:51,060
and we will always be grateful.

1346
01:03:54,164 --> 01:03:57,031
I'm so glad we came here.

1347
01:03:57,067 --> 01:04:00,367
I am, too.

1348
01:04:00,403 --> 01:04:02,497
So, what do you think?

1349
01:04:02,539 --> 01:04:05,531
Do you want to move forward?

1350
01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:08,977
Definitely.

1351
01:04:09,012 --> 01:04:13,006
I

1352
01:04:25,895 --> 01:04:28,023
Everybody ready?

1353
01:04:28,064 --> 01:04:29,498
Uh, for what?

1354
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:31,557
We still have to
decorate the gingerbread houses

1355
01:04:31,601 --> 01:04:33,296
for the dessert table,
of course.

1356
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:36,567
Yeah, I'm not sure
if it's the right time.

1357
01:04:36,606 --> 01:04:38,074
It's the perfect time.

1358
01:04:38,108 --> 01:04:39,542
I mean, we all
need to do something

1359
01:04:39,576 --> 01:04:41,237
while we're waiting, right?

1360
01:04:41,277 --> 01:04:43,405
Can Lexie come, too?

1361
01:04:43,446 --> 01:04:45,608
Of course.
The more the merrier.

1362
01:04:45,648 --> 01:04:48,276
It'll help the time go faster.

1363
01:04:48,318 --> 01:04:50,218
Okay.

1364
01:04:50,253 --> 01:04:53,188
Hey, let's get started.

1365
01:04:57,060 --> 01:05:00,052
Sara:
So, what do you think?

1366
01:05:00,096 --> 01:05:01,257
Well, its gonna
be fantastic.

1367
01:05:01,297 --> 01:05:02,890
I just hope it
isn't the only version

1368
01:05:02,932 --> 01:05:04,331
of the Christmas
ranch we get to see.

1369
01:05:04,367 --> 01:05:05,892
I'm sure it's fine.

1370
01:05:05,935 --> 01:05:08,131
It's the 23rd.

1371
01:05:08,171 --> 01:05:09,434
I mean, that's the
day of our deadline.

1372
01:05:09,472 --> 01:05:11,065
Shouldn't we have heard
something by now?

1373
01:05:11,107 --> 01:05:13,235
Well, the underwriters have
until end of business today.

1374
01:05:13,276 --> 01:05:16,143
I suppose, technically, they
have as long as they want.

1375
01:05:16,179 --> 01:05:18,011
Wait, they can
extend the deadline?

1376
01:05:18,047 --> 01:05:22,678
I guess if they
can't decide by today, yes.

1377
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:27,249
So, we can stay for Christmas?

1378
01:05:27,290 --> 01:05:29,224
I mean, we can't leave

1379
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:30,988
until we know for sure
about the loan, right?

1380
01:05:31,027 --> 01:05:32,961
Chloe, they have
their own traditions.

1381
01:05:32,996 --> 01:05:34,122
We don't want to impose.

1382
01:05:34,164 --> 01:05:36,258
Pops: You think you'd impose?

1383
01:05:36,299 --> 01:05:37,528
Part of our tradition

1384
01:05:37,567 --> 01:05:40,662
is having people we care
about here with us -

1385
01:05:40,703 --> 01:05:45,106
family and friends
old and new, and that's you.

1386
01:05:45,141 --> 01:05:47,508
It really wouldn't
be the same without you.

1387
01:05:53,116 --> 01:05:57,110
In that case there's
no place we'd rather be.

1388
01:05:57,153 --> 01:06:00,555
I guess we'll
postpone our flights.

1389
01:06:00,590 --> 01:06:01,989
Great.

1390
01:06:04,093 --> 01:06:17,598
I

1391
01:06:19,509 --> 01:06:21,170
(sighing)

1392
01:06:21,211 --> 01:06:23,236
{phone ringing)

1393
01:06:23,279 --> 01:06:25,111
Hello?

1394
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:29,016
Hi. Okay.

1395
01:06:29,052 --> 01:06:31,487
Okay.

1396
01:06:33,323 --> 01:06:35,621
Okay. Thank you.
I'll tell them.

1397
01:06:39,562 --> 01:06:40,757
(sighing)

1398
01:06:42,432 --> 01:06:43,763
The Carson Christmas Ranch...

1399
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,162
is officially in business!

1400
01:06:46,202 --> 01:06:47,169
Yes!

1401
01:06:47,203 --> 01:06:48,329
We got the loan?

1402
01:06:48,371 --> 01:06:50,703
- You got the loan!
- We got the loan! Oh!

1403
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:52,003
You did it!

1404
01:06:52,041 --> 01:06:53,099
No, we did it!

1405
01:06:53,142 --> 01:06:54,268
We should celebrate.

1406
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:55,641
What did you have in mind?

1407
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:58,147
Well, actually,
Stephen is having a little,

1408
01:06:58,181 --> 01:06:59,512
you know, party at his
restaurant,

1409
01:06:59,549 --> 01:07:02,246
kind of a
Christmas Eve-Eve tradition.

1410
01:07:02,285 --> 01:07:04,014
Maybe-- maybe we should go.

1411
01:07:04,053 --> 01:07:08,217
Uh, Chloe's welcome
too, of course. You all are.

1412
01:07:08,258 --> 01:07:09,623
What do you think, Chloe?

1413
01:07:09,659 --> 01:07:12,128
Mom, Lexie invited me

1414
01:07:12,161 --> 01:07:14,493
to go Christmas caroling with
her friends from school.

1415
01:07:14,531 --> 01:07:17,228
Her parents are chaperoning us.

1416
01:07:17,267 --> 01:07:18,632
That sounds like fun.

1417
01:07:18,668 --> 01:07:20,227
So, it's okay if I go?

1418
01:07:20,270 --> 01:07:22,398
Of course you can.

1419
01:07:22,438 --> 01:07:26,397
Kay and I could drop Chloe off
and then Kay would be at the B&B

1420
01:07:26,442 --> 01:07:28,501
to watch her when
she came back. Okay?

1421
01:07:28,545 --> 01:07:29,740
Mm-hmm.

1422
01:07:29,779 --> 01:07:32,077
Okay.

1423
01:07:32,115 --> 01:07:34,550
Then, that leaves
us the two of us.

1424
01:07:34,584 --> 01:07:36,416
I guess so.

1425
01:07:42,525 --> 01:07:45,358
Well, I'm so thrilled
for you, Travis.

1426
01:07:45,395 --> 01:07:46,726
Yeah?
About the Christmas Ranch?

1427
01:07:46,763 --> 01:07:50,757
Yes, but that's not
what I was talking about.

1428
01:07:52,535 --> 01:07:55,527
By the way, um...

1429
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:58,473
I'm really glad you've
been coming around more often.

1430
01:07:58,508 --> 01:08:02,138
Oh. Because of all
the food that I bring?

1431
01:08:02,178 --> 01:08:06,376
Yes... but that's not what
I'm talking about.

1432
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:09,317
Oh...
(chuckling)

1433
01:08:12,221 --> 01:08:23,599
I

1434
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:32,471
You look beautiful.

1435
01:08:32,508 --> 01:08:34,476
You look great, too.

1436
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:36,501
Thank you.

1437
01:08:36,546 --> 01:08:38,537
But I thought you'd
be wearing a bolo tie.

1438
01:08:38,581 --> 01:08:43,542
A bolo? No. I only wear those
on days that end in "never."

1439
01:08:51,194 --> 01:08:53,526
Big Fork really knows
how to celebrate Christmas.

1440
01:08:53,563 --> 01:08:55,190
That's how we do
things around here -

1441
01:08:55,231 --> 01:08:56,494
go big or go home.

1442
01:08:56,532 --> 01:08:58,796
I don't know how anyone
leaves this place.

1443
01:08:58,835 --> 01:09:00,530
Oh, they do.

1444
01:09:00,570 --> 01:09:01,765
But if they have any
Montana is in their soul,

1445
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:03,898
they always
find their way back.

1446
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,165
Like you did from New York?

1447
01:09:06,209 --> 01:09:10,203
Yeah. Yeah, I didn't realize how
good I had it until I left.

1448
01:09:10,246 --> 01:09:12,840
Sometimes you don't where you
belong until you get there

1449
01:09:12,882 --> 01:09:14,748
and then it all
becomes so clear.

1450
01:09:14,784 --> 01:09:17,583
Exactly.

1451
01:09:19,389 --> 01:09:21,824
Real glad to see you two.

1452
01:09:21,858 --> 01:09:23,553
Now, order whatever you like.

1453
01:09:23,593 --> 01:09:25,288
It's on the house.

1454
01:09:25,328 --> 01:09:28,263
Thank you.

1455
01:09:28,297 --> 01:09:29,822
(sighing)

1456
01:09:29,866 --> 01:09:32,665
(clearing throat)

1457
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:38,732
Oh.

1458
01:09:38,775 --> 01:09:42,234
It helps to be
good friends with the chef.

1459
01:09:44,347 --> 01:09:49,251
Roasted tofu with quinoa,
peaches and fennel. Wow.

1460
01:09:49,285 --> 01:09:52,550
Is that a good wow or, like...
{unenthusiastically) "Wow."

1461
01:09:52,588 --> 01:09:56,855
That's a great "wow."
Thank you for doing that for me.

1462
01:09:56,893 --> 01:09:59,225
Well, you jumped into the
Montana life with both feet.

1463
01:09:59,262 --> 01:10:00,923
I figured the least I could do

1464
01:10:00,963 --> 01:10:03,432
is try a little bit
of California.

1465
01:10:07,603 --> 01:10:09,901
What?

1466
01:10:09,939 --> 01:10:12,704
If you had asked me a month ago

1467
01:10:12,742 --> 01:10:15,211
where I would be
on Christmas Eve-Eve,

1468
01:10:15,244 --> 01:10:16,837
my answer definitely would not
have been

1469
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:18,711
"having a candlelight
vegetarian dinner

1470
01:10:18,748 --> 01:10:22,776
"with a cattle rancher
from Big Fork, Montana."

1471
01:10:22,819 --> 01:10:26,414
Really? 'Cause that's what my
answer would have been.

1472
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:34,863
{both laughing)

1473
01:10:36,532 --> 01:10:40,696
Ahh.
That was really good.

1474
01:10:40,737 --> 01:10:42,262
Yeah, I thought
I was going to have to sneak

1475
01:10:42,305 --> 01:10:45,400
a second supper on my the home.

1476
01:10:45,441 --> 01:10:47,239
{piano playing lightly)

1477
01:10:47,276 --> 01:10:48,869
Would you like to dance?

1478
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:53,545
I would love to.

1479
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:54,812
Okay.

1480
01:10:54,851 --> 01:10:59,755
{piano playing lightly)

1481
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:12,425
I

1482
01:11:35,057 --> 01:11:36,650
Did you want to
go for a stroll?

1483
01:11:36,692 --> 01:11:38,717
I'd love to.

1484
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:41,890
Okay. You know that "stroll"
means "walking slowly," right?

1485
01:11:41,931 --> 01:11:43,626
I'll do my best.

1486
01:11:43,666 --> 01:11:47,569
Okay.

1487
01:11:47,603 --> 01:11:49,594
I think this is the first time

1488
01:11:49,639 --> 01:11:51,073
we've ever walked
at the same pace.

1489
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:53,332
Yeah. Congratulations.

1490
01:11:53,376 --> 01:11:55,743
I think you're
finally on Montana Time.

1491
01:11:58,815 --> 01:12:01,045
Have I thanked you already
for saving our ranch?

1492
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:03,848
Yes,
numerous times.

1493
01:12:03,886 --> 01:12:05,479
Good.

1494
01:12:08,591 --> 01:12:10,992
Have I thanked you for
reminding me

1495
01:12:11,027 --> 01:12:13,860
what it feels like...

1496
01:12:13,896 --> 01:12:16,593
to fall head over heels
for someone?

1497
01:12:16,632 --> 01:12:18,566
No.

1498
01:12:21,737 --> 01:12:24,104
(sighing)

1499
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:27,105
I feel the same way.

1500
01:12:31,047 --> 01:12:33,914
But?

1501
01:12:33,950 --> 01:12:37,944
Maybe that's
why we shouldn't stay.

1502
01:12:37,987 --> 01:12:40,684
Why not?

1503
01:12:40,723 --> 01:12:43,818
I mean, we have to leave
right after Christmas.

1504
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:46,454
And...
and then what happens?

1505
01:12:46,495 --> 01:12:48,589
How does this work?

1506
01:12:48,631 --> 01:12:50,690
I don't know.

1507
01:12:50,733 --> 01:12:54,067
I don't,
but we'll figure it out.

1508
01:12:54,103 --> 01:12:55,434
No, Travis.

1509
01:12:55,471 --> 01:12:57,803
This is your life.
This is your home.

1510
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:01,140
I have a daughter at
school in Los Angles.

1511
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:04,472
I have a job. I have security.
I cannot give that up.

1512
01:13:04,513 --> 01:13:06,003
I'm sorry.

1513
01:13:09,952 --> 01:13:12,114
I understand.

1514
01:13:17,827 --> 01:13:19,693
I better get back to Chloe.

1515
01:13:35,912 --> 01:13:38,643
I don't want to leave.

1516
01:13:38,681 --> 01:13:40,115
We should be going to
Christmas Eve dinner tonight,

1517
01:13:40,149 --> 01:13:41,639
not the airport.

1518
01:13:41,684 --> 01:13:43,880
Chloe, I know you're upset,
but if we stayed,

1519
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,513
it would just make
things harder.

1520
01:13:45,554 --> 01:13:48,956
It's already hard.

1521
01:13:48,991 --> 01:13:51,961
Everything was
better here, Mom.

1522
01:13:51,994 --> 01:13:53,519
We were better.

1523
01:13:53,562 --> 01:13:58,466
You know it,
and I know it.

1524
01:14:00,136 --> 01:14:02,002
This is how
Christmas used to be.

1525
01:14:03,205 --> 01:14:07,005
You never talk
about Dad at Christmas.

1526
01:14:07,043 --> 01:14:11,503
We barely talk about anything,

1527
01:14:11,547 --> 01:14:14,141
not until we got here.

1528
01:14:14,183 --> 01:14:17,483
I know,
and that's my fault.

1529
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:21,081
I guess I thought
I was protecting you.

1530
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:23,820
I was just trying to
keep you from any more pain.

1531
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:27,555
I was doing the same thing.

1532
01:14:30,166 --> 01:14:32,635
That's the best thing
aboutthis place, wasn't it?

1533
01:14:32,668 --> 01:14:36,935
People slow down,
they talk, they share.

1534
01:14:36,973 --> 01:14:39,635
Like right now.

1535
01:14:39,675 --> 01:14:41,803
Just like right now.

1536
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:45,978
I still miss Dad.

1537
01:14:46,015 --> 01:14:47,540
I know.

1538
01:14:47,583 --> 01:14:49,847
Sodol.

1539
01:14:49,885 --> 01:14:52,855
I have something for you.

1540
01:14:52,888 --> 01:14:54,481
I was going to wait
until Christmas,

1541
01:14:54,523 --> 01:14:56,855
but I want you to have it now.

1542
01:15:00,196 --> 01:15:02,062
It's for the
Christmas charm bracelet

1543
01:15:02,098 --> 01:15:03,793
Daddy gave you when
you were little.

1544
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:05,733
I know that you don't have it
with you, but I thought...

1545
01:15:05,768 --> 01:15:09,534
I thought maybe that you'd
want to wear it again someday.

1546
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:14,166
I have it.

1547
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:17,703
I always have it.

1548
01:15:17,747 --> 01:15:20,148
I just...

1549
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:23,812
didn't want
to wear it again...

1550
01:15:23,853 --> 01:15:26,015
not until right now.

1551
01:15:30,659 --> 01:15:33,856
Thank you so much, Mom.

1552
01:15:36,132 --> 01:15:37,600
Merry Christmas.

1553
01:15:37,633 --> 01:15:41,297
Merry Christmas, sweetie.
I love you.

1554
01:15:43,806 --> 01:15:45,240
I love you, too.

1555
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:53,311
I

1556
01:15:54,583 --> 01:15:57,052
{cow lowing)

1557
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:10,829
I know what
you're gonna say.

1558
01:16:10,866 --> 01:16:11,924
And what's that?

1559
01:16:11,967 --> 01:16:13,833
That I shouldn't
have let her go,

1560
01:16:13,869 --> 01:16:16,839
that I was just too
scared to ask her to stay,

1561
01:16:16,872 --> 01:16:18,738
that I was worried
that it was turn out

1562
01:16:18,774 --> 01:16:20,037
the same way it
did with Elizabeth,

1563
01:16:20,076 --> 01:16:21,840
that I made
the biggest mistake of my life.

1564
01:16:21,877 --> 01:16:24,676
Yep. Pretty much.

1565
01:16:24,713 --> 01:16:27,114
Thanks for
saving me the trouble.

1566
01:16:27,149 --> 01:16:28,878
She has a career, Dad.

1567
01:16:28,918 --> 01:16:31,751
She has a life in California.
How's that gonna work?

1568
01:16:31,787 --> 01:16:34,848
You make her
know it in her heart

1569
01:16:34,890 --> 01:16:36,915
that it's at least worth trying.

1570
01:16:36,959 --> 01:16:39,223
And then you find a way,

1571
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:42,856
even if it means moving
heaven and earth to do it.

1572
01:16:42,898 --> 01:16:45,799
Well, it's too late now.

1573
01:16:45,835 --> 01:16:47,963
Maybe not.

1574
01:16:48,003 --> 01:16:51,667
Kay just told me
they're still at the B&B.

1575
01:16:51,707 --> 01:16:53,106
For how long?

1576
01:16:53,142 --> 01:16:57,010
At least another
fifteen minutes.

1577
01:16:57,046 --> 01:16:59,708
What if she
doesn't want to stay?

1578
01:16:59,748 --> 01:17:03,207
What if she does?

1579
01:17:04,954 --> 01:17:07,321
Can you handle
things here if I go?

1580
01:17:07,356 --> 01:17:08,949
Of course I can,

1581
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:11,050
and I'll have Kay to help me.

1582
01:17:11,093 --> 01:17:13,960
Dad, about Kay--

1583
01:17:13,996 --> 01:17:15,862
I know what you're going to say.

1584
01:17:15,898 --> 01:17:17,366
All I'm gonna say

1585
01:17:17,399 --> 01:17:20,699
is that if I'm
putting it out there,

1586
01:17:20,736 --> 01:17:22,795
you should, too.

1587
01:17:22,838 --> 01:17:24,738
Deal.

1588
01:17:36,185 --> 01:17:37,710
Chloe, honey, let's go upstairs,

1589
01:17:37,753 --> 01:17:39,152
make sure you
didn't forget anything.

1590
01:17:39,188 --> 01:17:41,122
Oh, but just for a minute.
The cab's almost here

1591
01:17:41,157 --> 01:17:42,886
Okay.

1592
01:17:56,772 --> 01:17:57,830
Hi.

1593
01:17:57,873 --> 01:17:59,238
Hi.

1594
01:18:03,078 --> 01:18:07,777
Is there something wrong with
the paperwork for the loan?

1595
01:18:07,816 --> 01:18:09,750
No.

1596
01:18:09,785 --> 01:18:12,254
No, nothing's
wrong the paperwork.

1597
01:18:12,288 --> 01:18:15,781
Okay.
{exhaling sharply)

1598
01:18:15,824 --> 01:18:19,886
But there's everything
wrong with you leaving.

1599
01:18:19,929 --> 01:18:21,727
Travis, we talked about this.

1600
01:18:21,764 --> 01:18:24,028
The longer we stay,
the harder it'll be to leave,

1601
01:18:24,066 --> 01:18:28,697
and I know if I spend
just one Christmas with you,

1602
01:18:28,737 --> 01:18:30,865
I will never want
to leave again.

1603
01:18:30,906 --> 01:18:33,068
Then stay...

1604
01:18:33,108 --> 01:18:36,203
for this Christmas
and every Christmas after that.

1605
01:18:36,245 --> 01:18:39,408
There's too much to lose.
I have to protect Chloe.

1606
01:18:40,983 --> 01:18:43,042
Well, you said she's
never been happier

1607
01:18:43,085 --> 01:18:47,488
and that you and she
have never been closer.

1608
01:18:49,124 --> 01:18:51,855
It's true.

1609
01:18:51,894 --> 01:18:54,727
So?

1610
01:18:54,763 --> 01:18:57,994
Isn't that what she needs?

1611
01:18:58,033 --> 01:19:01,435
Isn't that what
everyone needs?

1612
01:19:05,808 --> 01:19:08,800
Anyway, uh...

1613
01:19:08,844 --> 01:19:11,142
you can't leave.

1614
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:14,241
Around here,
we finish what we started.

1615
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:17,446
What do you mean?

1616
01:19:17,486 --> 01:19:19,215
Obviously,
I'm gonna need your help

1617
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:20,848
to find someone
to run the Christmas Ranch.

1618
01:19:24,893 --> 01:19:26,759
That could take some time.

1619
01:19:26,795 --> 01:19:31,062
I have a candidate in mind.

1620
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:35,230
In fact, I can't imagine
anyone running it but her.

1621
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:40,475
I just have to convince her
to take a leap of faith.

1622
01:19:42,244 --> 01:19:45,305
You just did.

1623
01:19:45,347 --> 01:19:47,543
I really don't want to leave.

1624
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:51,117
I really can't imagine
doing this without you.

1625
01:19:51,153 --> 01:19:52,484
{footsteps approaching)

1626
01:19:58,494 --> 01:20:00,826
What's going on?

1627
01:20:03,265 --> 01:20:05,529
We were wondering if...

1628
01:20:05,567 --> 01:20:07,558
you'd like to stay
through Christmas.

1629
01:20:10,205 --> 01:20:11,195
(chuckling)

1630
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:12,435
Is that a yes?

1631
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:15,034
I think that's
a yes from both of us.

1632
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:25,914
I

1633
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:30,485
I'm going to go tell Lexie!

1634
01:20:30,526 --> 01:20:33,052
Woman: You made it!

1635
01:20:35,931 --> 01:20:38,332
Hi!

1636
01:20:38,367 --> 01:20:40,893
I'm staying for Christmas!

1637
01:20:42,037 --> 01:20:44,404
{chattering indistinctly)

1638
01:20:46,141 --> 01:20:48,838
I can't stop thinking
about how close we came

1639
01:20:48,877 --> 01:20:49,969
to missing all this.

1640
01:20:50,012 --> 01:20:52,879
Oh, you don't have to.
You're here now.

1641
01:20:52,915 --> 01:20:57,318
You're home.

1642
01:20:57,353 --> 01:21:01,517
Does it get any more
perfect than this?

1643
01:21:01,557 --> 01:21:03,491
Actually... yes.

1644
01:21:06,929 --> 01:21:16,896
I

1645
01:21:24,580 --> 01:21:25,945
Merry Christmas, Dad.

1646
01:21:25,981 --> 01:21:27,142
Merry Christmas, son.

1647
01:21:27,182 --> 01:21:28,343
You made it.

1648
01:21:28,384 --> 01:21:30,250
Merry Christmas, Sara.

1649
01:21:31,286 --> 01:21:33,311
Merry Christmas.

1650
01:21:33,355 --> 01:21:34,982
Come on.

1651
01:21:47,469 --> 01:21:57,402
I
