00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,750
if you were
gonna ask someone,

175
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,120
what's the best way to go?

176
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,000
Listen,
all you got to do...

177
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,750
is look like me.

178
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,210
-Oh, ha-ha.
-(laughs)

179
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,000
-Mal.
-Hey, Jane.

180
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,080
Hey.

181
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,040
I was wondering...uh...

182
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,080
♪ ♪

183
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,960
if you liked the....

184
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,170
carrot cake last night.

185
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,000
I had the pumpkin pie.

186
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,120
-Oh, cool. Um, uh--
-Smooth.

187
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,120
I have an opening for
a fitting at 3:00.
Who wants it?

188
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,920
Me! Sorry.

189
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,790
Perfect.
I'll take you later.

190
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:12,960
-Okay, well...
-Mal?

191
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,830
-Yes?
-I hate to keep bugging you,

192
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,830
but the decorating committee
needs more answers.

193
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,710
So, as much
as I hate to, um...

194
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,830
you know, um...

195
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,170
-Bug me?
-Right.

196
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,880
Yeah, Jane, I would love to.
I just have to get to class.

197
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,960
-You know,
just nod if you like it.
-Okay.

198
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,880
Chair swags. Entry banner.
Twinkle lights.

199
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,080
Napkin design.
Table bunting.

200
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,120
And you still haven't picked
the party favors yet.

201
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,830
Honestly, Jane,
whatever you think--

202
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,170
I mean, we can do chains,
key charms, pen toppers.

203
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:37,170
I kind of love
the pen toppers,

204
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:38,920
but, I mean,
we can do all three.

205
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,040
(chuckles nervously)

206
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,790
I say pen toppers.

207
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:46,920
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

208
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,080
-You won't regret it.
-(laughing) Okay.

209
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,120
I can hardly wait
to see what your wedding
will look like!

210
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,960
Me, too.
Wait! What?!

211
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,750
The Royal Cotillion
is like getting engaged

212
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,000
to be engaged
to be engaged.

213
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,960
-(gasps) I knew it!
-Well, everyone knows it.

214
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,040
I didn't know it!
How come nobody told me that?

215
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,960
-Is my entire life just
planned out in front of me--
-Hi, Mal.

216
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,750
-Hi, Ben.
-Hi, Ben.

217
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,750
Oh, oh.
Quick moment.

218
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,670
-Uh...
-All right,
they're almost finished

219
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,000
with the surprise
for Mal's big night.

220
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,830
Snow White,
Belle.

221
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,880
But the one you designed for Mal
is my favorite.

222
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,790
Make sure
her eyes are green.

223
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,670
Uh... see you later.

224
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,830
Okay.

225
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,040
-Which green
should they use?
-Uh...

226
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,710
This one.

227
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,040
What about
peacock feathers?

228
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,080
Yeah, I bet you nobody's gonna
have those at Cotillion.

229
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:41,710
Chad,
when I look at you,

230
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,880
all I can think of is...

231
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,710
-"king."
-(gasps)

232
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,880
-And fake fur...
-Uh-huh.

233
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,920
...fake fur
says it all.

234
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,080
Loud and clear.

235
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,040
Amphitheater in five!

236
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:56,620
Why did the coach make him
captain instead of me?

237
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,790
I'm obviously better.
"King Chad," though.

238
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,920
I do rather like that.
(chuckles)

239
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,960
You know who else
would like that?

240
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,620
-Who?
-Audrey.

241
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,710
-She would.
-Chad, let's go.

242
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:08,920
I'm coming. Yeah.

243
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,920
Oh.

244
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,040
It-- I--

245
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,580
-Come on.
-It's just--

246
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,920
(both laugh)

247
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,620
-Not a lot of there there.
-Not a lot of there there.

248
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,920
Someone's obviously
having some trouble

249
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,670
dealing with
his break-up with Audrey.

250
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,750
Yes.

251
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,620
I've been
doing the numbers.

252
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,710
Yeah?

253
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:33,000
And after we collect
from all the girls
for their gowns

254
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,620
and Chad's cape...

255
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,670
(computer beeps)

256
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,920
(chuckles)

257
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,580
Wow!

258
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,830
No wonder
people work.

259
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:45,040
What am I gonna do
with all this money?

260
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,920
I think in the next
few years,

261
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,960
you could buy that castle
you always wanted.

262
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,880
(chuckles)

263
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,710
That way, you wouldn't
need a prince.

264
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:57,790
You're right, I don't.
Because I have you.

265
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,830
Hi, Mal.

266
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,620
(chuckling) Hi.

267
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,790
I have a little
surprise for you.

268
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:08,960
Again? Wow.

269
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,670
That's like
every day now.

270
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,790
Or every other day.
The even dates.

271
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,000
Because you're...

272
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,960
even more perfect
than I thought.

273
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,540
(laughs)

274
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,620
That is me.
I am perfect.

275
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,830
Come on,
let me spoil you.

276
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:23,960
You didn't have
a lot growing up.

277
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,830
We managed.

278
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,670
Hey, didn't you donate
that to the museum?

279
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,750
Is that
still in there?

280
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,540
Um, I got to get to class.
I really don't want to be late.

281
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,580
-No.
You come this way.
-(sighs)

282
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,880
-(Mal chuckles)
-First off...

283
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,920
-(gasps)
-Ta-da!

284
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,620
-What?!
-You like it?

285
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,620
Ben... (chuckles)

286
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,830
does an ogre
like cheese puffs?

287
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,830
This is amazing!

288
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:55,500
It's purple.

289
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,620
I didn't get you anything.

290
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,750
You're taking me on a picnic

291
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,540
with all my favorite
foods, remember?

292
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,670
No, that's Thursday.

293
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,580
-It is Thursday.
-No, it's not.

294
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,710
Yes, it is.

295
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:06,710
-No, it's not.
-It is.

296
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:08,460
I knew that.

297
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,960
-I mean, if you don't
have it, that's fine.
-No, no, no.

298
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,830
I was fully messing with you.
I knew it was Thursday.

299
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:14,710
I just have one more thing
to go bake, and then
I am all yours.

300
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,710
Well, what about class?

301
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,540
-She multi tasks.
-(chuckles)

302
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,580
-She dabbles.
-She dabbles. (laughs)

303
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,710
-You're the best!
-That's me!

304
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,710
All right, boys.
Let's line it up.

305
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,580

Let's go.

the rule book?

We're down a man.

I'm sorry.
Coach trusts me.

339
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:09,500
I'm not gonna stay captain if
I just throw out the rule book.

1229
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:07,960
She's gonna be okay.

1230
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:10,170
Yeah.

1231
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:13,000
But she could be
so much more.

1232
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,960

1233

00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:28,170
That one was epic.
That went on
for actual days.

1236
00:56:28,170 --> 00:56:29,250
Like it mattered, right?

1237
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:32,170
They were both undone
by True Love's Kiss.

I really thought that's
what you and Ben had.

1241
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,290
Do you want
to talk about it?

1242
00:56:42,290 --> 00:56:46,790
Nah. I'm not
coming back, Evie.

1243
00:56:46,790 --> 00:56:50,120
I can't. I really
tried to tell you.

1244
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:51,250
Yeah.

1245
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:56,250
But, I mean, I saw
the way your face lit up

1246
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:59,120
when we walked
through those dorm rooms
for the first time.

spoil that for you.

I'm staying, too.

And don't pretend
to look out for me.

1351
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:58,670
Because no one's

you tied up.

1363
01:03:22,830 --> 01:03:26,420

Mm.
Funny and a gentleman.

I really hope I don't have to
feed you to the fishes.

1367

Well, you don't. Set me free,
and we'll go back together.

Oh, so now I get
an invite?

1369

Gee, I wonder why.

1370
01:03:43,710 --> 01:03:48,750
When you brought Mal, Evie,
Carlos, and Jay to Auradon,

1371
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:53,620
that's as mad as
I've ever been in my life.

1372
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:56,830
And trust me,
I've been plenty mad.

1373
01:03:58,580 --> 01:04:01,380
I never thought of it
like that before.

1374
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:05,380
That I could've hurt
the people I didn't pick.

1375
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:10,460
My plan was to start
with four kids and bring
more people over.

1376
01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:12,420
I guess I was
busy being king.

1377
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:16,380
That sounds lame.

1378
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:19,580
I'm so sorry.

1379
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:21,420
You're a leader, Uma.

1380
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:22,830
So am I.

1381
01:04:22,830 --> 01:04:25,460
Come to Auradon
and be part of the solution.

1382
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:28,420
Me?

1383
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:30,670
Part of your solution?

1384
01:04:36,670 --> 01:04:39,380
Nah.

1385
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:41,540
I don't need you.

1386
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:44,580

01:04:57,540 --> 01:05:00,460
-I'll get the swords.
-Okay.

1390
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:02,540

-It's good to see you.
-Thanks.

And Dude.

1395
01:05:12,290 --> 01:05:13,420
I told you to stay.

1396
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:15,330
I flunked obedience class.

1397
01:05:15,330 --> 01:05:16,710
Great. And he
can still talk.

1398
01:05:16,710 --> 01:05:20,380
You're lucky
I love you.
Come on.

1399
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:27,460
Ooh.
Here, let me see.

1400
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:29,420
Wow, what a beauty.

1401
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:31,380
-It's noon.

That's not so different
from you when you came
to Auradon, Mal.

I'm such a mess.

1646
01:19:37,750 --> 01:19:44,670

I mean, six months ago,
I was, you know,

1647
01:19:44,670 --> 01:19:47,580
stealing candy
from babies, and now

1648
01:19:47,580 --> 01:19:49,620
everybody wants me to be
this Lady of the Court.

1649
01:19:49,620 --> 01:19:53,620
And I have no idea
how to keep up the act.

1650
01:19:53,620 --> 01:19:54,880
Then don't.

1651
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:56,790

1652
01:19:56,790 --> 01:20:00,710
Maybe it wasn't.

We're always gonna be
the kids from the Isle.

1654
01:20:04,790 --> 01:20:06,500
I tried to forget it.

1655
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:09,830
I really tried,
but those are our roots.

1656
01:20:12,460 --> 01:20:17,460
And we all did what
we had to do to survive.

1657
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:20,620
But it made us who we are.

1658
01:20:20,620 --> 01:20:24,460
And we're never gonna be
like anybody else here.

1659
01:20:24,460 --> 01:20:27,750
And that's okay.
That's okay.

1660
01:20:27,750 --> 01:20:29,580
And we can't fake it.

1661
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:31,380
No.

1662
01:20:31,380 --> 01:20:34,460
Yeah. I mean, especially
without my spell book.

1663

love the real you,

1664
01:20:37,460 --> 01:20:39,750
then he's not the one.

1665
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:42,380
I like that.

1666
01:20:42,380 --> 01:20:43,580
Give him a chance.

1667
01:20:45,620 --> 01:20:48,670
I'm gonna make some
changes to your dress.

1668
01:20:48,670 --> 01:20:51,620

only if you're up for it--

and you can't stand
another day,

01:21:25,540 --> 01:21:28,670
I'll drive you
back tomorrow myself.

1678
01:21:31,580 --> 01:21:33,380

the Isle's got on Auradon.

1693
01:22:16,420 --> 01:22:19,580

we want you by our side--
girl or boy.

Okay, practice is over.
Get out of here.

01:23:09,670 --> 01:23:12,250
Yeah?

1714
01:23:12,250 --> 01:23:13,500
Wait until I tell my mom.

1715
01:23:14,540 --> 01:23:17,210
Let's get out of here.

1716
01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:22,580
Come in.

1717
01:23:22,580 --> 01:23:25,380
I have a scout badge
in s'mores!

1718
01:23:25,380 --> 01:23:27,210

-Are you seeing

-Are you?
-No.

1721

Is it Happy's son?

1722
01:23:32,460 --> 01:23:35,460
Because let me tell you,
he is not as happy as his dad.

1723
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:37,330
Kind of a dark streak,
in fact.

1724
01:23:37,330 --> 01:23:40,670
Doug, Ben was captured
on the Isle.

1725
01:23:40,670 --> 01:23:44,420
We rescued Ben
and saved Auradon.

1726
01:23:44,420 --> 01:23:46,580
So you're not seeing
Happy's son or anyone else?

1727
01:23:49,670 --> 01:23:51,710
Don't be dopey.

1728
01:23:56,290 --> 01:23:59,290
Besides, we have
dresses to deliver.

1729
01:23:59,290 --> 01:24:01,210
It is Cotillion day,
after all.

1730
01:24:02,540 --> 01:24:04,250
And you know what?

1731
01:24:04,250 --> 01:24:06,170
I was lucky enough
to have been given a chance,

1732
01:24:06,170 --> 01:24:10,170
and now I need to give
someone else a chance, too.

1733
01:24:10,170 --> 01:24:11,580
My Uncle Bashful
used to say that.

1734
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:13,500
-Did he?
-Yeah.

1735
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:15,290
But really quietly.

1738
01:24:20,580 --> 01:24:23,250
-Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Say no more.
-Jane. Jane. Jane!

1739
01:24:23,250 --> 01:24:25,330
Hey, hey, uh...

1740
01:24:27,170 --> 01:24:29,290
-Would you go to
Cotillion with me?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

1741
01:24:29,290 --> 01:24:30,670
We're all taking a stretch
carriage over at 6:00.

1742
01:24:30,670 --> 01:24:33,460
No, no, no. The pen toppers
are in the port side cabin.

1743
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:39,120
No, I--
I mean... with me.

1744
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:40,540
Yeah, want me to
swing by your room?

1745
01:24:40,540 --> 01:24:43,420
No, no, no. So, when you're on
the boat facing the left...

1746
01:24:43,420 --> 01:24:46,120
Yeah, yeah. Right.
No, no, no. Not right, left.

Jane?

1749
01:24:51,290 --> 01:24:56,540
Would you be my date
for Cotillion?

1750
01:24:56,540 --> 01:25:02,380
And if you don't absolutely
hate me by the end of it, um,

1751
01:25:02,380 --> 01:25:08,290
would you consider maybe
being more than friends?

1752
01:25:08,290 --> 01:25:11,170
-Maybe?
-Like boyfriend
and girlfriend?

1753
01:25:11,170 --> 01:25:13,330
Where we can hold hands
instead of slugging
each other all the time?

1754
01:25:13,330 --> 01:25:15,250
And we can text, and I can
tell you how great you are?

1755
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:16,500
Because, Carlos, you're
really, really great.

01:34:52,790 --> 01:34:54,960
The...

1921
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:01,790
Uh, so as my gift to her,

1922
01:35:01,790 --> 01:35:04,790
I'm bringing down the barrier
once and for all!

1923
01:35:04,790 --> 01:35:07,670
(gasping)

1924
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:12,710
Mateys, we ride with the tide!

1925
01:35:12,710 --> 01:35:15,540
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

1926
01:35:15,540 --> 01:35:18,750
(gasping)

1927
01:35:18,750 --> 01:35:21,580
Fairy Godmother.

1928
01:35:21,580 --> 01:35:22,750
Bring down the barrier.

1929
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:24,500
I most certainly
will not.

1930
01:35:24,500 --> 01:35:25,670
I am your king!

1931
01:35:25,670 --> 01:35:26,750
Obey him.

1932
01:35:26,750 --> 01:35:27,790
(gasping)

1933
01:35:27,790 --> 01:35:29,880
Ben's been spelled.

1934
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:30,920
Ben.

1935
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:32,960
Uma found
your spell book.

1936
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:34,750
Just look at me.

1937
01:35:41,790 --> 01:35:43,540
Ben.

1938
01:35:44,750 --> 01:35:46,880
Ben.

1939
01:35:49,670 --> 01:35:51,880
-Look at me.
-No, look at me.

1940
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:53,620
-You love me, remember?
-No, you don't.

1941
01:35:53,620 --> 01:35:55,620
-Yes, you do.
-Ben, look at me.

1942
01:35:55,620 --> 01:35:56,920
Bring down
the barrier now!

1943
01:35:56,920 --> 01:35:59,540
I do not take
orders from you!

1944
01:35:59,540 --> 01:36:00,920
Ben?

1945
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:03,750
Ben, I never told you
that I loved you because

1946
01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:05,920
I thought that
I wasn't good enough.

1947
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:09,620
And I thought that it was only
a matter of time before
you realized that yourself.

1948
01:36:09,620 --> 01:36:12,620
But, Ben, that's me!

1949
01:36:12,620 --> 01:36:14,620
I'm part Isle
and part Auradon.

1950
01:36:14,620 --> 01:36:15,790
Ben, eyes over here.

1951
01:36:15,790 --> 01:36:17,920
And, Ben, you've always
known who we were

1952
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:20,500
-and who we can be.
-Don't listen to her.

1953
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:23,580
Ben, I know what
love feels like now.

1954
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:29,500
Ben, of course
I love you.

1955
01:36:30,830 --> 01:36:33,580
Ben, I've always
loved you.

1956
01:36:33,580 --> 01:36:36,830
(gasping)

1957
01:36:44,540 --> 01:36:45,670
Mal.

1958
01:36:51,620 --> 01:36:53,790
True love's kiss.

1959
01:36:53,790 --> 01:36:55,750
Works every time.

1960
01:36:55,750 --> 01:36:59,620
-Ugh, give it to me!
-No! Guards, seize her!

1961
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:02,710
No, no!

1962
01:37:02,710 --> 01:37:04,790
Stop, please! Stop!

1963
01:37:05,880 --> 01:37:08,420
Uma, I know you.

1964
01:37:08,420 --> 01:37:11,620
You are so much more
than just a villain.

1965
01:37:11,620 --> 01:37:13,710
And you have to believe me,
because I've been there.

1966
01:37:15,670 --> 01:37:17,790
Do not let your pride
get in the way

1967
01:37:17,790 --> 01:37:20,380
of something
that you really want.

1968
01:37:31,540 --> 01:37:33,580
No, no! Uma!

1969
01:37:33,580 --> 01:37:35,620
Ben: Uma!

1970
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:02,670
(screaming)

1971
01:38:05,420 --> 01:38:08,540
(laughs)

1972
01:38:10,580 --> 01:38:12,420
Ah!

1973
01:38:12,420 --> 01:38:15,330
(sighs)

1974
01:38:15,330 --> 01:38:17,460
True love's kiss
won't defeat this.

1975
01:38:19,330 --> 01:38:21,790
The world will know my name!

1976
01:38:22,790 --> 01:38:24,710
Aaah!

1977
01:38:24,710 --> 01:38:26,580
(screaming)

1978
01:38:28,420 --> 01:38:29,620
Aah!

1979
01:38:29,620 --> 01:38:32,460
(screaming)

1980
01:38:35,540 --> 01:38:37,380
(thunder crashes)

1981
01:38:40,540 --> 01:38:43,380
(laughs)

1982
01:38:45,290 --> 01:38:46,380
Mal?

1983
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:57,750
(roaring)

1984
01:38:57,750 --> 01:38:59,710
(laughs)

1985
01:39:01,580 --> 01:39:03,290
(roaring)

1986
01:39:04,620 --> 01:39:06,330
Aah!

1987
01:39:06,330 --> 01:39:07,580
Come on, Mal!

1988
01:39:07,580 --> 01:39:09,670
Let's finish this
once and for all!

1989
01:39:23,420 --> 01:39:24,460
(gasps)

1990
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:30,540
Aah!

1991
01:39:30,540 --> 01:39:32,540
Watch out!

1992
01:39:32,540 --> 01:39:35,420
(screaming)

1993
01:39:42,330 --> 01:39:44,290
(roaring)

1994
01:39:45,620 --> 01:39:48,460
(screams)

1995
01:39:50,460 --> 01:39:52,460
(thunder crashes)

1996
01:39:52,460 --> 01:39:55,500
Wait, Ben! No!

1997
01:39:58,210 --> 01:39:59,460
-Ben!
-Ben!

1998
01:39:59,460 --> 01:40:01,620
-Ben!
-Ben!

1999
01:40:01,620 --> 01:40:03,540
Mal, Uma!

2000
01:40:03,540 --> 01:40:05,330
Stop! Back down!

2001
01:40:05,330 --> 01:40:08,580
(laughs)
What are you
gonna do, Ben?

2002
01:40:08,580 --> 01:40:11,290
Splash me?
(laughs)

2003
01:40:11,290 --> 01:40:12,380
That's enough!

2004
01:40:12,380 --> 01:40:15,250
It's got to stop!
This isn't the answer!

2005
01:40:15,250 --> 01:40:19,210
The fighting has got to stop!
Nobody wins this way!

2006
01:40:19,210 --> 01:40:21,580
We have to listen
and respect each other.

2007
01:40:24,210 --> 01:40:28,710
It won't be easy, but let's
be brave enough to try.

2008
01:40:28,710 --> 01:40:33,500
Uma, I know you want
what is best for the Isle.

2009
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:36,420
Help me make a difference.

2010
01:40:40,330 --> 01:40:42,330
(roars)

2011
01:40:47,420 --> 01:40:49,500
(roars)

2012
01:41:24,250 --> 01:41:26,290
(splash)

2013
01:41:29,540 --> 01:41:33,120
There you go.

2014
01:41:34,420 --> 01:41:36,380
Jay:
Good job, man.

2015
01:41:36,380 --> 01:41:39,210
(cheers and applause)

2016
01:41:49,290 --> 01:41:50,580
(roars)

2017
01:41:55,620 --> 01:41:57,420
(thud)

2018
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:05,170
Ooh!

2019
01:42:05,170 --> 01:42:07,170
(laughs)

2020
01:42:11,330 --> 01:42:13,170
(laughs)

2021
01:42:20,330 --> 01:42:23,210
(giggles)

2022
01:42:25,540 --> 01:42:28,500
(cheers and applause)

2023
01:42:32,210 --> 01:42:34,420
-(sighs)
-Whoo!

2024
01:42:34,420 --> 01:42:36,580
So, I did not know
that I could do that.

2025
01:42:36,580 --> 01:42:39,290
Tell me about it.
That makes two of us.

2026
01:42:39,290 --> 01:42:41,460
-(sizzling)
-Oh. (blows)

2027
01:42:41,460 --> 01:42:44,170
-Thank you.
-Shall we?

2028
01:42:44,170 --> 01:42:46,210
We shall.

2029
01:42:46,210 --> 01:42:48,420
Hi.

2030
01:42:53,420 --> 01:42:56,210
(sighs)

2031
01:42:56,210 --> 01:42:57,330
(laughter)

2032
01:42:57,330 --> 01:43:00,120
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

2033
01:43:00,120 --> 01:43:01,380
How about that son of mine?

2034
01:43:01,380 --> 01:43:02,460
-Ours.
-Ours.

2035
01:43:02,460 --> 01:43:04,460
Yes.
How about his girlfriend?

2036
01:43:04,460 --> 01:43:07,040
I think we're in
very good hands here.

2037
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:09,460
Very good hands.

2038
01:43:09,460 --> 01:43:12,170
I owe you guys so much.

2039
01:43:12,170 --> 01:43:13,290
-Yeah.
-Really.

2040
01:43:13,290 --> 01:43:14,500
-Yep.
-You got that right.

2041
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:17,210
-Just a little bit.
-If there is anything

2042
01:43:17,210 --> 01:43:19,330
that you need, or anything
I can do for you...

2043
01:43:19,330 --> 01:43:25,250
Um, actually, there is, Ben.

2044
01:43:25,250 --> 01:43:30,080
I know a girl who would
really love to come to Auradon.

2045
01:43:31,330 --> 01:43:35,080
It's Drizella's
daughter, Dizzy.

2046
01:43:35,080 --> 01:43:37,040
She's like
a little sister to me.

2047
01:43:37,040 --> 01:43:39,250
Then she should come.

2048
01:43:39,250 --> 01:43:41,330
Okay! (laughs)

2049
01:43:41,330 --> 01:43:44,250
Okay, great!

2050
01:43:44,250 --> 01:43:46,000
Actually, um...

2051
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,250
(laughter)

2052
01:43:47,250 --> 01:43:51,080
Ben, there's a lot of kids
who would really love it
here in Auradon.

2053
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:54,380
Kids just like us, who also
deserve a second chance.

2054
01:43:54,380 --> 01:43:57,420
Can I maybe get you a list?

2055
01:43:57,420 --> 01:44:02,080
Yes, yes!
Absolutely, please.

2056
01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:03,290
(cheers and applause)

2057
01:44:03,290 --> 01:44:05,080
Great.

2058
01:44:05,080 --> 01:44:08,380
M'lady Mal, we found
your spell book below deck.

2059
01:44:08,380 --> 01:44:10,210
Uma had it.

2060
01:44:10,210 --> 01:44:12,170
Ooh.

2061
01:44:12,170 --> 01:44:15,000
Um...

2062
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:18,120
You know, this seems
like the kind of thing

2063
01:44:18,120 --> 01:44:20,120
that belongs in the hands
of Fairy Godmother.

2064
01:44:20,120 --> 01:44:21,330
Fairy Godmother?

2065
01:44:21,330 --> 01:44:22,960
That's me, thank you.
Mm-hmm.

2066
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:24,120
This belongs
in the museum.

2067
01:44:24,120 --> 01:44:26,080
It does, yes,
and I'm gonna take it.

2068
01:44:26,080 --> 01:44:27,120
Go for it.

2069
01:44:27,120 --> 01:44:29,080
(laughter)

2070
01:44:29,080 --> 01:44:32,000
I'm not gonna
be needing it anymore.

2071
01:44:34,040 --> 01:44:35,120
(gasping)

2072
01:44:35,120 --> 01:44:36,290
(laughs)

2073
01:44:36,290 --> 01:44:39,000
Aah!
