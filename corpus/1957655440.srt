1
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,199
No one took the environment seriously

2
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:15,742
until it was too late.

3
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:22,749
Food, water and air were poisoned
by the years of pollution.

4
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,671
Most people died of disease and hunger.

5
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,009
The rich people moved
underground where it was safe.

6
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,636
Everyone else was left behind.

7
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:37,973
Killers and criminals
formed ruthless gangs.

8
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,976
When they weren't fightin' each other,

9
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,110
they were tr yin' to
break into the underworld

10
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:44,938
to steal our food and water.

11
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:49,067
That's where I come in.

12
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:52,946
I work for TCU, Tracker-Communicator,

13
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,366
an elite division of the
underworld security forces.

14
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,911
Our job was to track the breakers,

15
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,414
kick them out or terminate them.

16
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,942
Jason, it looks like there's trouble

17
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,287
with the protective voice bit.

18
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,467
Shoot this Zoey, and let's
get the hell outta here.

19
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,426
Copy.

20
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,762
Standby to record.

21
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:24,227
I had a laser decoder,
a high-voltage immobilizer

22
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:27,064
and a rookie partner named Zoey Kinsella.

23
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,397
Entrance granted.

24
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:29,565
Unit 22.

25
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:32,110
Her father helped form the underworld

26
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:34,404
before he was murdered.

27
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:37,115
I was sure she was gonna
get my ass in trouble,

28
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:38,742
but she was cool.

29
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,747
Man, is it hot up there or what?

30
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,167
It's just one big fr yin' pan out there.

31
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,628
Hey Henshaw, Dale.

32
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:50,961
You're late.

33
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:52,673
We're lucky we made it here at all.

34
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,299
My heart bleeds.

35
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:56,153
Would you rather have the night shift?

36
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:56,843
Oh gee, I don't know.

37
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,387
What do you think, Jason?

38
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,180
Tough call.

39
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,974
Relaxing night off or
Surface World at night.

40
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:05,894
Keep your eyes open, guys.

41
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:07,646
Hey, it's a jungle out there.

42
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:12,733
Exit granted.

43
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:13,943
Unit 99.

44
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,615
Let's hope it's a quiet night.

45
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:20,349
What I'd give for a cup of coffee

46
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:21,952
and a fresh donut about now.

47
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:24,412
Look out!

48
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:27,207
Control, unit 99.

49
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:28,542
We're under attack.

50
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:29,876
Transition gate 11.

51
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,294
Send backup.

52
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,263
Attention, code three security alert.

53
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,599
Repeat, code three security alert.

54
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,685
Breaker attack in progress.

55
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,854
All available TC units standby.

56
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:49,688
Oh shit.

57
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,857
Well so much for a relaxing night off, huh?

58
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:52,691
Tell me 'bout it.

59
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,152
Unit 22, security breach in transition.

60
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,851
Barks, this is Storm and Kinsella.

61
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:06,663
We're trackin' "em.

62
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:08,165
Let's go.
- Yeah, let's do it.

63
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:09,498
Confirmed, 22.

64
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,541
Be careful out there.

65
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,627
You're outnumbered.

66
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,006
Two down.

67
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,339
Look out behind you.

68
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:27,267
Control, ETA to transition gate one minute.

69
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,113
Riles.

70
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,787
Entrance denied.

71
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,120
Quick, grab a body.

72
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,873
Go through the gate.

73
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:53,293
Entrance granted.

74
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:54,961
Unit 99.

75
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,343
They're heading toward sub-level three.

76
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:05,514
They're must be heading toward
the food storage center.

77
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,307
Sparks, Storm and Kinsella here.

78
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:10,519
We're trackin' two breakers
in the quadrant X-17.

79
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:11,937
Looks like they're hungry.

80
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,231
No backup required yet.

81
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,167
TC-Unit 22, this is Control.

82
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:35,501
What is your status?

83
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:36,086
Over.

84
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:37,087
Control, Unit 22.

85
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,381
We have breakers at X-17, Y-42.

86
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,049
Unit will split solo.

87
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:42,008
On our way.

88
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:42,884
I'll take the big guy.

89
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:43,844
Take care of yourself, partner.

90
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,177
You too.

91
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:45,863
Oh shoot.

92
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:11,597
Man.

93
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,900
Back to Surface World for you, chump.

94
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:25,362
Unit 22, Kinsella has breaker in custody.

95
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,196
Ditto, partner.

96
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:27,771
Let's get these breakers topside.

97
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:28,782
You got it.

98
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,577
Attention,

99
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,163
return to security status six.

100
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:35,997
Hi.

101
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:38,083
Breakers have been apprehended

102
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,000
and obtained.

103
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:43,254
Repeat, return to security status six.

104
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,467
Hey Sparks.

105
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:49,636
The job is done, Sparks.

106
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,346
Controller wants to see you.

107
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,680
Nice work.

108
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,018
Thanks.

109
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,113
Bigelow, Harold out.

110
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,076
How the hell did the breakers get in?

111
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:17,163
They used the dead
bodies of Dale and Henshaw.

112
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,039
Shit.

113
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,166
Man, that shit is ridiculous.

114
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,117
You know, someone is feeding the breakers

115
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:23,336
our exact schedules.

116
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,170
I know.

117
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,799
It's bad, but I'm
looking into it personally.

118
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:29,708
Meanwhile, we've gotta keep our patrols up

119
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,302
or the breakers will be all over us.

120
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,055
Sparks, send him in here.

121
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,933
He's on his way, sir.

122
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,476
So what've you found today?

123
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:42,605
Well we recorded a variety
of topographical locations.

124
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,066
When you match it to
Jason's gathering chip,

125
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,200
think you just might
find that Mother Nature's

126
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,279
working on a remedy for the lack of ozone.

127
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,240
I wouldn't be too sure about that.

128
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:57,495
Cameron, I'd like you to meet
Zoey Kinsella and Jason Storm.

129
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,956
The two best trackers that we have.

130
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,291
Cameron Johnson.

131
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:02,917
We've met before.

132
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,251
How could I forget?

133
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:05,774
You spent a year putting word viruses

134
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,589
in my computer programs.

135
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:11,009
Dr. Cameron was my cybernetics
professor at the university

136
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,762
until he left to go to med
school at what was it, 14?

137
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,346
So I suppose he was
captain of the football team.

138
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,100
Well we're on the same team now.

139
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:23,521
Cameron's gonna analyze
the data that you bring me,

140
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:26,608
see how it interfaces with our new

141
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,943
TC project on Surface World.

142
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,987
TC 2000 X's actually.

143
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,363
2000 X?

144
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,610
Yeah, cybernetic trackers.

145
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,244
Nice to know you can always be replaced.

146
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,622
Well I wouldn't worry about that.

147
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:43,500
We haven't had a lot of
volunteers for this project.

148
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,086
Well it would mean movin' to Surface World.

149
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,171
You won't find me signin' up.

150
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,882
Oh, that surveillance camera
at the communication center,

151
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:52,749
it just looks like a standard breakdown

152
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:53,958
in the protective force field.

153
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:54,968
Thanks, Zoey.

154
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:58,514
Sparks?

155
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,434
Establish unit 13 to the
communication center.

156
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,853
Repair surveillance camera.

157
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:04,687
Aww.

158
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,314
You little prick!

159
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,766
Nice attitude to start the day, blondie.

160
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:10,936
Yeah, well nice assignment.

161
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:12,669
Dale and Henshaw just got fuckin' smoked

162
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,354
comin' through that transition gate.

163
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:14,906
Shit.

164
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,825
Gettin' really scary out there.

165
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:17,659
Fuckin' Controller.

166
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,400
Someone should ship his ass up there.

167
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:19,994
What'd you say, track?

168
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,163
Hey, it's the Controller's right-hand man.

169
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:23,497
Hey.

170
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:27,502
Back off, Bigelow.

171
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,506
See you in the gym, tracker.

172
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,507
All right, you two.

173
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:33,841
You know the rules.

174
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,844
Our enemies of the
criminals of Surface World,

175
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,595
not each other.

176
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:39,597
When trackers and guards have problems,

177
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:41,975
they sort them out here in the gym.

178
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,308
Anything goes.

179
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:45,270
All right, Bigelow.

180
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,104
Let's go.

181
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:47,438
Take this track down.

182
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:48,398
Fight, Bigelow.

183
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,731
Do it.

184
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:51,692
Let's go, Jason.

185
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:52,944
C'mon, Jason.

186
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:10,795
Jason, come on.

187
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,715
Man, get up. Make him work for it.

188
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,255
C'mon, Jason. You can do it.

189
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,390
Go!

190
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:27,144
Yeah, yeah!

191
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:32,733
Go, Jason! Go!

192
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:33,817
Get up!

193
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,069
Go!

194
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,905
Go, Jason! Go!

195
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,531
Come on. Let's go, Jason!

196
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:39,865
C'mon!

197
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,215
Let's go, Jason!

198
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,548
Yes, yes!

199
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:17,819
Get him, Jason.

200
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,113
C'mon, c'mon!

201
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,447
Now!

202
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,120
Get up, Jason!

203
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,163
Get him!

204
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:34,629
Jason, get him!

205
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,673
Attention all tracker units and guards,

206
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:40,551
please report for night
shift detail at 1900 hours.

207
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:50,937
Guys. C'mon, break it up.

208
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,791
- That's enough.
- Come on, be friends.

209
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,782
Word is you took care of Bigelow.

210
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,617
Yeah, I taught him a thing or two.

211
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:07,078
He'd be outta commission for a long time.

212
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,956
Well I doubt the Controller's

213
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,410
gonna be too happy about it.

214
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,876
Yeah, well I'm not too
happy with the Controller.

215
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,296
He shouldn't hire guards like Bigelow.

216
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,299
You know, I was just thinking.

217
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,550
Thinking?

218
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,927
Not about Surface World again.

219
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:26,180
Quit playin' with that thing.

220
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,224
You're making me nervous, 'kay?

221
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,476
My dad said never to take it off.

222
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,645
But he never told you what it was for.

223
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:34,647
Right.

224
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,275
So it must not be a
key to a buried treasure.

225
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:38,608
Maybe.

226
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,494
What do you really
think's goin' on up there?

227
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,915
You know, you're like this
every time we come back.

228
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,249
Can't you relax?

229
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,960
Look who's talking.

230
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:57,660
If you keep foolin'
around with that data crap,

231
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,339
stuff's gonna get you in trouble.

232
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,550
You have to admit things
are starting to grow up there.

233
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:03,884
Yeah, the gangs.

234
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,054
Somebody could be
makin' it easier for them.

235
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,890
I think there's a leak
in the security system.

236
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,223
Zoey, leave it alone.

237
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:12,852
Try some of my mussel pasta.

238
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,104
No thanks.

239
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:20,777
I am going to go and
try to figure this out.

240
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:22,737
It's driving me crazy.

241
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,740
Well the Controller's not stupid.

242
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:27,074
I know.

243
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:29,118
Be careful, okay?

244
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:30,452
I will.

245
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,703
Enjoy your dinner.

246
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:32,455
Thank you.

247
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:33,789
Looks really good.

248
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,876
I knew she was right.

249
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,837
Maybe the Controller was
keeping somethin' from us.

250
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,048
Could this go right to the top?

251
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,842
Our Overlord seemed like a decent leader,

252
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:47,678
but maybe he didn't know
anything about this.

253
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:48,513
Controller,

254
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,890
Master Sumai has been
located on Surface World.

255
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,350
Monitor seven.

256
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:53,184
Should I dispatch a tracker unit?

257
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:55,895
No, that won't be necessary, Sparks.

258
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:57,303
Sumai opposes no immediate threat.

259
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,649
But keep me posted as to his whereabouts.

260
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,582
You keep killin' these off-surface scum,

261
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,111
the less for me to do later.

262
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:02,128
Use the chi, Sumai.

263
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:03,462
Use the chi.

264
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:24,942
Welcome friends to my humble home.

265
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:26,527
We have much to celebrate.

266
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:30,114
Blade, let's hear some music.

267
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,790
That's nice.

268
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,834
Nice.

269
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,712
Picassos, the time has
come for Surface World

270
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:46,672
to reclaim what's rightfully ours

271
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,966
and defeat the underworld forces.

272
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,677
We may now penetrate their
underground sanctuary

273
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,347
with this, a tracker's PDR.

274
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,932
A gift from the enemy.

275
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,061
So let's party, boys.

276
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,110
Long live the Picassos.

277
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:14,909
TC unit 13, this is Control

278
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:16,243
What is your status?

279
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:17,536
Over.

280
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,330
Fleming and Zirmex here.

281
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:21,958
We've reached the communication center.

282
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:22,792
The protective force field

283
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,044
on surveillance camera
76 has been sabotaged.

284
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,296
The tech is working on restoring power now.

285
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,423
What is your ETR, unit 137

286
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:30,925
Over.

287
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,499
Estimated completion of repairs

288
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:33,677
at 2400 hours.

289
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:34,928
Over.

290
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,223
Zircon, a shame to waste

291
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,183
a bottle of this great stuff.

292
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:41,769
It could make for a fun evening.

293
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:46,566
But sometimes I guess we have
to make sacrifices, don't we?

294
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:50,902
Death to the underworld!

295
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,202
Breaker attack!

296
00:17:58,536 --> 00:17:59,036
Breaker attack.

297
00:17:59,370 --> 00:17:59,996
We need backup.

298
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:00,997
One man down.

299
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,791
Send a Med Vac team immediately.

300
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:09,672
Help!

301
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:10,506
Help me!

302
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,049
Somebody help me!

303
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:43,831
Bring the bodies to the
transition gate and be quick.

304
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,584
Come on, let's go!

305
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,894
You're mine, tracker.

306
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,188
Entrance granted.

307
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:11,025
Entrance denied.

308
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:20,159
Come on, bring the bodies
before they breach the gate.

309
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:21,994
Hurry up, splay.

310
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,375
Security breach, transition gate 12.

311
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:33,339
Scramble tracker unit seven, 10, 22.

312
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,424
Seven, 10 and 22.

313
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:37,551
Breakers on monitor six.

314
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,388
Oh, Niki Picasso.

315
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,598
Hello.

316
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,280
Come on.

317
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:41,406
Our mission awaits us.

318
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,709
All right, let's get these guys.

319
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:58,340
Okay unit 10, take tunnel 105.

320
00:20:58,674 --> 00:20:59,674
Come around behind.

321
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,553
They're at X-45, Y-14

322
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:05,181
and they definitely know their way around.

323
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,516
Okay unit seven, take
the high-side tunnel 104.

324
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:08,350
Flank right.

325
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,164
They're not headed for the reservoir,

326
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,313
then where are they going?

327
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:16,025
- Attention.
- Calling for backup.

328
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,235
Other breach at quadrant.

329
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,961
Perhaps these gentlemen will oblige us

330
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,505
and give us a hand here.

331
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:43,302
Attention, code one security alert.

332
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,002
They've breached the tunnel access codes.

333
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,096
They're into quadrant 13.

334
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,430
Alert the trackers.

335
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:49,767
Attention TC units seven and 22,

336
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,100
this is Control.

337
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,187
Breakers have exited the mainframe tunnel.

338
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:54,521
They're into quadrant 13.

339
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:55,885
God, they must've got unit 10.

340
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,515
It's the only way they could've gotten in.

341
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:58,525
Damn.

342
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:07,336
Control, they're heading for the reservoir.

343
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,620
Correction, they've turned
north to quadrant 36.

344
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:12,248
We got 'em cornered.

345
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,167
The hell? This is a dead end.

346
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:16,501
Wait.

347
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:20,214
What're they doing?

348
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:30,933
Fuck.

349
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:33,644
Entry by unauthorized personnel

350
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:35,058
is not permitted.
- Control,

351
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:36,225
this is Storm and Kinsella.

352
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,840
We just chased the breakers
into what used to be a dead end.

353
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:40,943
What the hell's goin' on, Sparks?

354
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:42,277
My apologies, 22.

355
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:43,570
We're working on it.

356
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:45,656
Additional tracker units
have been dispatched.

357
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:46,990
Please standby.

358
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,159
There we are.

359
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:52,662
Follow me.

360
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,313
What are your precise coordinates, 227

361
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:02,923
Okay, Control. We're East 47, North 52.

362
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:05,301
North 527

363
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,553
Nobody's been there for years.

364
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:09,179
They're right under us.

365
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:10,890
Where's the Controller?

366
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,463
Anything I can help you with?

367
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:13,809
No.

368
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:15,143
Proceed with caution.

369
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:15,936
No kidding.

370
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,270
Come on.

371
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:22,359
Attention, this quadrant is restricted.

372
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:26,614
Entry by unauthorized
personnel is not permitted.

373
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,449
Somethin's wrong, Zoey.

374
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,462
Why the hell would a breaker risk his life

375
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:31,696
goin' through the dead zone?

376
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,537
Doesn't make any sense.

377
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:36,415
This place doesn't even
show up on our maps.

378
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,459
How do they know about it if we don't?

379
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,563
Trackers, looks like

380
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:02,816
It's time to die.

381
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,735
It's time to get a new watch.

382
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:20,644
Ah, what a beauty.

383
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:24,106
You didn't let me down.

384
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,983
Surprise.

385
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:33,114
Shit.

386
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:35,024
- C'mon, Zoey. Let's go.
- Jason, he's got guns.

387
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:36,354
Let's get outta here.
- I got you.

388
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,997
Unit 22, this is Control.

389
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:40,831
Do you read me?

390
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:42,448
Control, this is Storm and Kinsella.

391
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:43,818
We have to find the system backup.

392
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:51,744
Sparks, they're shooting at us.

393
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,343
Send backup.

394
00:25:56,764 --> 00:25:58,015
Repeat, send backup.

395
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:01,769
Sparks, come in!

396
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:08,358
We're trapped.

397
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:10,235
I have an idea.

398
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:22,038
No!

399
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,050
Zoey.

400
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:34,383
Real guns

401
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:37,262
with real bullets.

402
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:40,182
Zoey. Zoey, hold on.

403
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:41,058
Don't talk.

404
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:41,892
Save your strength.

405
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:44,686
Would you lie to me, Jason?

406
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,380
You said we'd be partners forever.

407
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,607
Zoey, we are partners.

408
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,275
Partners forever.

409
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:51,609
Zoey.

410
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:54,821
Zoey.

411
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:58,951
Zoey.

412
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,410
Zoey.

413
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:01,745
Zoey.

414
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,079
Zoey.

415
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,289
No!

416
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,291
Zoey.

417
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:09,877
But why do you want her

418
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:11,046
at Terminal Station anyway?

419
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,380
Never mind that.

420
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:13,590
Just answer my question.

421
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:16,468
Can we program her to do whatever I want?

422
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:17,386
Certainly.

423
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,169
If you want her to take on the lifers

424
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:21,014
at the Terminal Station, she'll do it.

425
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:22,349
No questions asked.

426
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:24,393
She may require some assistance,

427
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:26,895
but I can program her
to be very resourceful.

428
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:28,480
And they have to be dead.

429
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:29,814
Clinically.

430
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,609
For the radical neural restructuring.

431
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:34,278
Or do you erase your memory?

432
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:35,611
Too dangerous.

433
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:39,283
No one'll figure out how
to access the memory.

434
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:42,702
No one.

435
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:47,666
Well it's not exactly what
the Overlord had in mind,

436
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,042
but what the hell?

437
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:55,799
Now I'll see about getting
her apartment back.

438
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:04,975
Remember, you're my woman tonight.

439
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:05,809
- Leave her alone!
- Tell you what to do

440
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:07,143
and everything.

441
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,354
Get outta here, kid.

442
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:17,029
And I take what I want.

443
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,362
Leave us alone!

444
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,532
You'll do as I say or I'll-

445
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:21,950
- Leave us alone.

446
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,121
Don't ever

447
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:29,583
interfere in my way

448
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:34,338
'cause I'll tear your head off.

449
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,939
You didn't have enough, did ya, pal?

450
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,441
Well I've had enough of this.

451
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:56,484
C'mere you.

452
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:02,175
Mama, you okay?

453
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:07,639
It's you and me!

454
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:18,442
C'mon, little man.

455
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:21,320
I'll show you who's big and tough.

456
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:22,112
Come on to me.

457
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:23,655
Come on and play my game.

458
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:39,755
Enhance three times.

459
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:55,062
A PDR?

460
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:56,480
They're strictly TC-issued.

461
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:59,107
Shit, they have an access code.

462
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:01,151
They had help from the inside.

463
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:02,652
Zoey, you were right.

464
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:03,987
They sold us out.

465
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,911
So it is that we can
commit to the elements.

466
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:15,832
The body of our sister, Zoey
Kinsella, here departed.

467
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:19,252
Earth to earth, ashes to
ashes and dust to dust.

468
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:21,505
But as sure as certain hope

469
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:24,132
of the resurrection to eternal life.

470
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:26,717
Sorry, Jason.

471
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:32,807
We'll miss her.

472
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:35,560
My condolences.

473
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:55,446
Her father and I worked on
a lot of projects together

474
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:57,165
before we moved underground.

475
00:31:57,499 --> 00:32:00,836
It seems like Zoey's always
been a part of my life.

476
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,609
If there's anything I can do, Jason.

477
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,799
I would like to see her
one more time if I can.

478
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:07,676
That's out of my hands.

479
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:10,554
Her body's the property of
the security council now.

480
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:13,348
That property used to be
my partner for 10 years.

481
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,686
Her chips, her access codes,

482
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,312
they've all got to be removed.

483
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:21,440
Like all trackers,

484
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,025
she's now listed as classified information.

485
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,359
Well that's fucked.

486
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:29,197
Breakers have access to
classified info and we don't?

487
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:30,531
What?

488
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:33,368
Zoey recorded our last run.

489
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:35,954
The breakers had a PDR
with an access code on it.

490
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:37,728
Does anybody else know about this?

491
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,583
No, but I'm not stickin' around

492
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,293
to see someone else get greased.

493
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:43,794
Do you wanna quit?

494
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:46,005
You want out?

495
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:48,467
Fine.

496
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,428
Report for total deprogramming right now.

497
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,431
If you know what's good for you,

498
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:05,817
get the hell outta here.

499
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:07,611
Prepare to remove his homing system,

500
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:10,238
directional finder and access chips.

501
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:11,072
Cardiac monitor?

502
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,950
A little bradycardiac
doctor, but okay at 52.

503
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:14,784
ECG normal.

504
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:15,619
Blood pressure?

505
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:16,952
130 over 70.

506
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,288
Set up for an art line.

507
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:19,664
Normal saline.

508
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:40,976
What the hell?

509
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,687
Jason Storm is still alive?

510
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,054
Why didn't you take care of him

511
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:45,555
in the deprogramming room like I told you?

512
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,484
There was too many people around.

513
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,097
Besides, I could ruin my career.

514
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:50,779
Screw your career.

515
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,405
You work for me now.

516
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:56,952
Bigelow, you get your boys on
him and don't you screw up.

517
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:10,673
Storm, Storm!

518
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:11,341
We've got you now.

519
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:12,175
Storm!

520
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:15,762
Storm, open up!

521
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,874
Take this all.

522
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,719
There he is!

523
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:57,971
Oh shit.

524
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:07,605
Shit.

525
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:13,068
Damn, man.

526
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:13,820
We're dead meat.

527
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:15,155
No, he's dead meat.

528
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,795
Attention, fugitive at large

529
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,756
in sector four.

530
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:35,050
Apprehend immediately.

531
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:39,596
Authorize and identify all
unsanctioned personnel.

532
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:56,196
Trackers, Jason Storm has
defected to the Surface World.

533
00:35:57,614 --> 00:35:59,908
This poses a significant security risk.

534
00:36:01,034 --> 00:36:03,203
And I have further information

535
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:06,998
that confirms Jason
orchestrated the break-in

536
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:09,292
that resulted in Zoey Kinsella's death.

537
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:14,506
Jason Storm is a traitor
and must be apprehended.

538
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:54,462
If you wanna see the sights,
you've gotta pay the price.

539
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:59,259
So gimme your bag, pretty boy,

540
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:02,095
and I'll let you live.

541
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:04,097
Back off, rat face.

542
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:05,932
I've had a hard day.

543
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:49,933
Get him.

544
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:03,406
Come on.

545
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:11,455
Waste him.

546
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,404
Keep your bag. I don't want it.

547
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,034
Members of the press,

548
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:50,411
we've always been committed
to the safety of those

549
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:51,996
who live here in underworld.

550
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:54,499
We are increasingly concerned

551
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:58,795
by the unrest and lawlessness
coming from above.

552
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:02,882
We are under attack and we must fight back.

553
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:05,134
I present to you a scientific marvel

554
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:08,137
which will ensure your protection
for the coming century.

555
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:15,645
80% human, 202 machine and
1002 dedicated to its mission.

556
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,815
Ladies and gentlemen,

557
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:22,527
I give to you the TC 2000

558
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:24,654
X.

559
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:32,787
Grandmaster.

560
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:01,691
Hey, look over here.

561
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,730
Are there any more of
you where you come from?

562
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:11,284
- Over here.
- Get a closeup shot.

563
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:12,618
Turn this way please.

564
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,704
Miss TC, thanks so much.

565
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:16,038
Miss 2000.

566
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:21,669
Sorry, I have to kill her.

567
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:25,340
Cybernetic crimes?

568
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,113
Controller, you're makin' a mistake.

569
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:31,346
You're the key, Zoey.

570
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:52,075
Hey big boy, lookin' for a good time?

571
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:57,830
Tick-tock goes the clock.

572
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:58,665
Time's running out.

573
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:02,001
Get 'em. Get 'em now before
the next batch get here.

574
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:04,963
The time for betting is over.

575
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,298
The time for fighting is now.

576
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:11,135
Our challenger tonight has
the speed of the jaguar,

577
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:16,265
the strength of the rhino,
the sting of the scorpion.

578
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:18,393
He's Zap.

579
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:31,698
He's known throughout the territory

580
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:33,700
for his skill and cunning.

581
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:37,954
He's a survivor, master of
all who come before him.

582
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:41,249
The reigning champion: Sumai!

583
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:56,723
You'll reap the greatest
prize we have to offer.

584
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:00,935
Of the two that have entered
here, only one may leave.

585
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:02,269
Ca-reel

586
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,510
Come on.

587
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:54,322
Yeah, yeah!

588
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,252
Look out, Sumai.

589
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:10,378
He's got a knife.

590
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:19,407
Miller, Kasney.

591
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:20,741
What a surprise.

592
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:25,036
Yeah, for you.

593
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:27,123
Let's get this traitor outta here.

594
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:38,842
Forget about Sumai.

595
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,051
Get me the girl.

596
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:51,731
I'll take care of this bitch.

597
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:24,012
Stop!

598
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:27,098
Join us.

599
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:36,234
I thought you'd never ask.

600
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:02,802
You have earned my
father's respect, tracker.

601
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:04,553
That is very rare.

602
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:06,180
The name is Jason.

603
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:08,349
He helps me, I help him.

604
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:10,434
Far as I'm concerned, we're even.

605
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,144
He wishes to thank you anyway.

606
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:17,775
How'd you end up with that?

607
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,360
That belongs to you.

608
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:22,280
You know you would've won the fight,

609
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,533
but I accept somethin' a
little more precious than water

610
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:26,866
and that's information.

611
00:46:27,827 --> 00:46:30,454
I'm looking for guy with
a painting on his face.

612
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:32,373
Niki Picasso.

613
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:34,792
That sounds like a man that fits the face.

614
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:37,586
There are very few who do
not know of Niki Picasso.

615
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:41,299
What of Niki?

616
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,468
He killed my partner
and that's why I'm here.

617
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,122
He has terrorized us for years.

618
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,586
So why hasn't someone stopped him?

619
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:49,265
Sumai, you're a great warrior.

620
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:50,808
Why haven't you taken him on?

621
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:52,601
I am one man.

622
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:53,936
Niki's gang is many.

623
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:55,670
Well then let's go play his game.

624
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:58,107
Let's go round up some good
fighters and go kick his ass.

625
00:46:58,441 --> 00:47:01,152
Only the lifers will
stand up to Niki Picasso.

626
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,404
Let's go get the lifers
and pay Niki a visit.

627
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:06,198
The lifers are a brotherhood
of vicious criminals,

628
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:08,159
a closed society.

629
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,286
They protect Terminal Station.

630
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:11,619
Terminal Station?

631
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:14,373
Terminal Station is a
chemical warfare plant.

632
00:47:14,707 --> 00:47:17,668
The population of the Surface
World was to be eliminated

633
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:19,587
when the ozone lair repaired itself.

634
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:22,131
That's insane.

635
00:47:22,465 --> 00:47:24,925
So far it has been impenetrable.

636
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:26,510
But there is some fear

637
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,971
that someone discovered
the key inactivated.

638
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:29,930
Picasso?

639
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:31,682
Niki Picasso's very clever but-

640
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:35,269
- Niki Picasso's goin' down
with you or without you.

641
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:38,731
Go by day.

642
00:47:39,065 --> 00:47:41,609
It's the only way to get
close to Niki's fortress.

643
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:43,903
He thinks no one is stupid
enough to go by day.

644
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:46,072
No one ever accused me of being bright.

645
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:53,329
Now why should I trust you?

646
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:55,623
You've been sent by the Controller.

647
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:59,502
I've been programmed to
rescue Surface World at any cost

648
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:01,128
and you will help.

649
00:48:01,462 --> 00:48:03,255
You have a great army of warriors.

650
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:05,341
You and the Picassos are the only fighters

651
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:07,968
who can defeat the protectors
of Terminal Station.

652
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:10,471
It's simple.

653
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:13,724
You get me safely to the
Terminal Station door

654
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:18,020
and the Controller will
get you whatever you want.

655
00:48:18,354 --> 00:48:20,074
The last time I worked with the Controller

656
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:21,690
I almost got my ass shot.

657
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:25,403
Well this one, I will personally guarantee.

658
00:48:55,224 --> 00:48:56,475
Sumai?

659
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:57,977
You're crazy to go alone.

660
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:59,437
Crazy to go together.

661
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,230
But much less crazy.

662
00:49:01,564 --> 00:49:04,108
In day, the Picassos sleep.

663
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,574
Let's make our way to the tower.

664
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:28,048
Niki Picasso down there.

665
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:28,883
Very difficult.

666
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:30,885
No problem. Tracker school 101.

667
00:49:34,722 --> 00:49:36,056
So we have two choices, Sumai:

668
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,559
either I lower you or you lower me.

669
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:41,479
Don't forget to write.

670
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:44,857
Wise choice.

671
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,925
Where is it?

672
00:50:55,678 --> 00:50:57,346
I know it's here somewhere.

673
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:17,825
♪ Dances in your mind ♪»

674
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:21,370
♪ Is somethin' pure -

675
00:51:21,704 --> 00:51:22,746
- Can you hear it, honey?

676
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:35,758
Scumbag.

677
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:39,346
I waited a long time for this moment.

678
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:40,764
You killed my partner.

679
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,266
Killed who?

680
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,600
Oh no.

681
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:45,311
Don't screw with me, you sack of shit.

682
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:46,644
Hey, hey.

683
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,522
Don't kill the messenger of good news.

684
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:51,942
She's still alive.

685
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:53,944
Bullshit. How do you know?

686
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:56,196
I know much more than you think.

687
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:58,032
Where do you think I got this?

688
00:51:58,365 --> 00:51:59,575
Does it look familiar to you?

689
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:01,535
Okay, okay.

690
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:02,953
You wanna see her?

691
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:05,372
Honey, you got a visitor in here.

692
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:43,660
Zoey?

693
00:52:43,911 --> 00:52:45,162
Easy, boy.

694
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:46,830
She's a wild one.

695
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:51,709
Partner?

696
00:53:29,081 --> 00:53:30,081
Zoey, it's me.

697
00:53:34,086 --> 00:53:35,129
Zoey, stop it.

698
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:44,387
Hey.

699
00:53:58,986 --> 00:53:59,986
Zoey, stop it!

700
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:11,915
Zoey, I thought.

701
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:18,839
Zoey, stop it!

702
00:54:19,173 --> 00:54:20,674
Zoey, no. I can't fight you.

703
00:54:22,885 --> 00:54:23,885
What?

704
00:54:31,143 --> 00:54:32,143
What?

705
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:52,289
Bye-bye Jason.

706
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:15,020
What the hell happened, Sumai?

707
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:19,817
TC 2000 X.

708
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,902
You've been unconscious for a day now.

709
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:23,529
What just happened?

710
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:25,906
What has part of this android?

711
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,324
She's no android.

712
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:28,867
Her name is Zoey.

713
00:55:29,201 --> 00:55:30,369
She used to be my partner.

714
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:33,247
The lifers have encountered her.

715
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:34,790
The lifers?

716
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:36,123
Oh man.

717
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:38,335
If Niki gets her to the Terminal Station,

718
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:39,962
do you know what that means?

719
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:41,380
They end the Surface World.

720
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:44,090
We gotta get goin'.

721
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:47,343
Rest.

722
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:01,483
We'll make our move soon.

723
00:56:01,817 --> 00:56:03,977
The lifers must be surprised
if they're to be defeated.

724
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:06,363
Nobody has ever defeated the lifers.

725
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:07,697
But we will, Niki.

726
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:09,324
We'll kill them all.

727
00:56:09,658 --> 00:56:11,034
Enter Terminal Station

728
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:13,287
and all of Surface World will be ours.

729
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,205
- Found them.
- Trust us, Niki.

730
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:17,291
All power will be yours.

731
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:20,210
What the hell is going on?

732
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:23,547
Why isn't she leading him
back to the Terminal Station?

733
00:56:23,881 --> 00:56:25,841
She's merely fulfilling my program.

734
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:28,010
Love takes time.

735
00:56:30,012 --> 00:56:33,891
Did I ask you for an
android on hormone overdrive?

736
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:35,517
Your counter-programming

737
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:37,561
could jeopardize this whole operation.

738
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:40,345
She's gotten this far, hasn't she?

739
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:43,275
This far is not good enough.

740
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:47,321
Now you get her back on track

741
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:51,283
before the Overlord finds
out that she's even up there,

742
00:56:51,617 --> 00:56:52,617
all right?

743
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:02,396
Chi energy transfers power through objects?

744
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:05,314
Will you teach me?

745
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:08,109
Yes.

746
00:58:26,795 --> 00:58:30,007
Sumai, I can't remember the
last time I felt so great.

747
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,259
Feel like I'm part of a team now.

748
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:34,011
May not be Storm and Kinsella but-

749
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:35,846
- Kinsella?
- Kinsella?

750
00:58:37,264 --> 00:58:38,264
Zoey Kinsella.

751
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:38,932
What's up?

752
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:41,643
A man named Bertram Kinsella
built Terminal Station

753
00:58:41,977 --> 00:58:43,437
to replenish the atmosphere.

754
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:46,189
Instead, it became the
ultimate weapon of death.

755
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:48,025
Zoey's father.

756
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:50,777
My father often told me of a young girl

757
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:53,363
who was the sunshine of
this brilliant man's life

758
00:58:53,697 --> 00:58:55,407
before he was murdered.

759
00:58:55,741 --> 00:58:56,408
Zoey's father?

760
00:58:56,742 --> 00:58:58,076
Terminal Station?

761
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:00,454
How do you actually
open up the gate, Sumai?

762
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:01,997
This is the mystery.

763
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:03,610
It died with Bertram Kinsella.

764
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:05,167
I don't think so.

765
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,461
Zoey's father once gave her a necklace.

766
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:09,129
What did it look like?

767
00:59:09,463 --> 00:59:11,590
It was a child's hand
outstretched holding a-

768
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:12,591
- A key.

769
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:13,924
Bingo.

770
00:59:15,427 --> 00:59:16,053
There it is, Niki.

771
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:18,430
The Terminal Station door.

772
00:59:18,764 --> 00:59:20,223
This is not gonna be easy.

773
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:22,237
Nothing worth waiting for should be easy.

774
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:24,853
Really play hardball, don't you?

775
00:59:25,187 --> 00:59:26,187
And so do I.

776
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:29,565
Ow!

777
00:59:32,778 --> 00:59:34,196
I got this one, Niki.

778
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:43,383
We'll need all the Picassos for this one.

779
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:49,044
Where is she going?

780
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:53,465
Why don't you stay there?

781
00:59:53,799 --> 00:59:55,801
All is working out, I trust.

782
00:59:57,761 --> 00:59:58,761
Fine.

783
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:01,181
Fine. Couldn't be better.

784
01:00:01,515 --> 01:00:02,515
Good.

785
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:04,768
Good. That's what I like to hear.

786
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:07,270
The TC 2000 X,

787
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:08,647
everything's working out?

788
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:10,816
Like a charm.

789
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:13,610
Everything is going
completely according to plan.

790
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:14,944
Yes, I can see that.

791
01:00:16,488 --> 01:00:17,906
Let's hope it stays that way.

792
01:00:52,274 --> 01:00:53,275
I think we're ready.

793
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:55,651
Too soon.

794
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:57,486
Too soon?

795
01:01:03,285 --> 01:01:04,619
Whether it's controlling Niki

796
01:01:04,953 --> 01:01:06,496
or sealin' off the Terminal Station,

797
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:09,499
I'm not gonna sit around
here and watch him.

798
01:01:11,585 --> 01:01:13,628
Why haven't you guys joined forces

799
01:01:13,962 --> 01:01:15,797
and tried to squash this little parasite?

800
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:19,801
There's a limit to hospitality

801
01:01:20,135 --> 01:01:22,012
and you're coming dangerously close.

802
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:25,765
Sumai, what are you gonna do?

803
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:27,099
Enough!

804
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:36,275
Sorry I was pushy.

805
01:01:36,568 --> 01:01:37,736
But your people need a leader

806
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:39,654
and I think it's your father's time.

807
01:01:39,988 --> 01:01:41,489
You want all the answers?

808
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:44,784
The station my father
knows it inside and out.

809
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:46,536
When they asked him to come here,

810
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:49,831
it was to train guards to
protect military secrets,

811
01:01:50,165 --> 01:01:51,833
not guards for instruments of death.

812
01:01:52,167 --> 01:01:53,247
They lied to your father.

813
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:54,461
It wasn't his fault.

814
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:13,396
What the hell are you
doing outta the control room?

815
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:15,370
Had to take a dump for crying out loud.

816
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:16,942
Well you're the genius.

817
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:18,652
Figure out some way to do that

818
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:20,570
while you watch that monitor.

819
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:22,239
I'm not done with you yet.

820
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:26,076
If this thing screws up,
you'll go down with me.

821
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:26,910
You have a problem with that?

822
01:02:27,244 --> 01:02:28,244
Yeah, I do.

823
01:02:30,247 --> 01:02:32,457
I created the perfect protector,
not the perfect Killer.

824
01:02:32,791 --> 01:02:33,791
It's the same thing.

825
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,919
Other side of the coin, kid.

826
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:38,713
Anyway, I didn't see you complaining

827
01:02:39,047 --> 01:02:42,717
when you had Zoey Kinsella's
body to fondle in this project.

828
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:49,266
I suppose you figured no one
would notice one more bullet.

829
01:02:50,976 --> 01:02:51,976
That one was perfect.

830
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:56,398
You orchestrated it all
from the control room.

831
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:57,771
The Med Vac team rushed in

832
01:02:57,899 --> 01:03:00,902
and all of a sudden she was
on my table and you knew.

833
01:03:02,237 --> 01:03:03,597
You knew no one would ever realize

834
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:04,906
what had really killed her.

835
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:07,616
And what's that?

836
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:11,204
A bullet from a handgun.

837
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:13,289
Hmm?

838
01:03:14,708 --> 01:03:16,584
A handgun like this?

839
01:03:18,712 --> 01:03:20,130
You're wrong, kid.

840
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:22,048
Guns don't kill people.

841
01:03:23,258 --> 01:03:24,634
People kill people.

842
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,985
Well well well.

843
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:44,988
You were closer to the truth
than you thought, lover boy.

844
01:03:46,156 --> 01:03:48,908
Lifers guard terminal entrance here.

845
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:52,912
And we're gonna hide over here.

846
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:57,208
First, we need more fighters.

847
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:59,586
The lifers are very tough.

848
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:01,212
Sumai, you okay.

849
01:04:07,135 --> 01:04:09,929
Listen, you people need
to give to the program.

850
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:11,473
Sumai said it all.

851
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:13,933
The time to act is now.

852
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:16,603
We trust Sumai, but Niki's a killer.

853
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:18,688
The old guy struts his stuff

854
01:04:19,022 --> 01:04:21,566
and you're all ready to drop to your knees.

855
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:25,236
Well go ahead and let this
old fossil get y'all killed.

856
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:28,114
If you're lookin' for a
leader, I'm right here.

857
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:30,825
This guy's a joke.

858
01:04:32,744 --> 01:04:33,912
My time to lead.

859
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:01,731
Who will join us to fight Niki Picasso?

860
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:17,789
I'll vouch for these two.

861
01:06:04,169 --> 01:06:06,337
We've just gotten word from Niki.

862
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:10,592
That's good, Bigelow.

863
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:12,469
Our plans are unfolding nicely.

864
01:06:17,432 --> 01:06:19,767
So we have a lot to do.

865
01:06:20,101 --> 01:06:22,562
An extended coffee break, I presume.

866
01:06:23,855 --> 01:06:26,483
There's a little something
I want to discuss with you.

867
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:31,237
It concerns my TC 2000 X.

868
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:33,740
Well

869
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:38,203
sir, your TC 2000 X is just fine.

870
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:39,536
Really?

871
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:42,290
The TC 2000 X was conceived

872
01:06:42,624 --> 01:06:44,375
to protect the people in my quadrant.

873
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:45,919
That was her sole purpose.

874
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:50,340
Now I want you and your boys

875
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:53,468
to catch the next bus to Surface World

876
01:06:53,801 --> 01:06:56,763
and I want my investment back here now!

877
01:06:57,805 --> 01:06:59,766
Bigelow.

878
01:07:02,185 --> 01:07:05,313
Not here, not now in front of everybody.

879
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:16,157
Bigelow,

880
01:07:16,491 --> 01:07:18,952
I think you're gonna like
living on Surface World.

881
01:07:51,693 --> 01:07:52,893
Serva protect Terminal Station

882
01:07:52,986 --> 01:07:53,986
with their lives.

883
01:07:54,279 --> 01:07:55,613
We'll just see about that.

884
01:07:58,783 --> 01:08:00,451
Chancy, Blade, take out the guards.

885
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:02,829
Zircon, follow behind.

886
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:14,674
Death to the lifers!

887
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:40,199
Attack!

888
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:41,784
Shit, no more bullets.

889
01:09:02,722 --> 01:09:04,974
Head for the lifers!

890
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:12,231
Looks like Niki Picasso beat us to it.

891
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:27,372
Let's let them Kill off the lifers

892
01:09:27,705 --> 01:09:30,124
and then we make our move.

893
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:57,694
Well you got me to the Terminal Station.

894
01:09:58,027 --> 01:09:59,779
Now let's just wait for the Controller.

895
01:10:02,115 --> 01:10:03,116
Let's party.

896
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,886
'Kay, I got you to the door.

897
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,264
You've done a soldier's job, Niki,

898
01:10:26,597 --> 01:10:28,077
and you'll get everything I promised:

899
01:10:28,307 --> 01:10:31,227
guns, ammunition and real food.

900
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:33,938
And then what?

901
01:10:34,272 --> 01:10:37,024
And you'll live like kings and queens

902
01:10:37,358 --> 01:10:38,860
here on the Surface World.

903
01:10:39,193 --> 01:10:39,777
You stay here.

904
01:10:40,111 --> 01:10:41,195
We'll be right back.

905
01:10:41,529 --> 01:10:44,031
No, I'm goin' up too.

906
01:10:44,365 --> 01:10:45,992
I'm not letting you out of my sight.

907
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:54,083
The key to her father's
heart and the key to my future.

908
01:10:56,544 --> 01:10:58,024
Now it's time for daddy's little girl

909
01:10:58,212 --> 01:10:59,756
to get down on her knees, isn't it?

910
01:11:00,757 --> 01:11:02,592
Because daddy's little
girl was much smarter

911
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:03,925
when he made this lock.

912
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:06,219
Would you?

913
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:16,981
Positive identification.

914
01:11:20,193 --> 01:11:21,193
It is time.

915
01:11:38,377 --> 01:11:39,377
Let's go.

916
01:11:42,465 --> 01:11:45,259
Attention Christmas shoppers,
this store's now closing.

917
01:11:46,636 --> 01:11:47,887
Let's go.

918
01:11:58,189 --> 01:11:59,941
Your father was a brilliant man, Zoey.

919
01:12:00,274 --> 01:12:02,735
Unfortunately, he was also a fool.

920
01:12:03,069 --> 01:12:05,154
He thought he could save Surface World.

921
01:12:05,488 --> 01:12:06,604
He died before the full power

922
01:12:06,614 --> 01:12:08,241
of Terminal Station was realized.

923
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:20,378
C'mon, let's go.

924
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:30,346
The kill zone is only
accessible from the top floor,

925
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:33,057
so we'll cut through the
cookhouse here to the stairs.

926
01:12:36,269 --> 01:12:37,311
Picassos.

927
01:12:45,111 --> 01:12:45,611
Who the hell are they?

928
01:12:45,945 --> 01:12:47,822
It is Jason Storm and Master Sumai.

929
01:12:48,155 --> 01:12:48,656
Well what are they doin' here?

930
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:49,990
Don't look at me.

931
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:50,867
Blade, go help them.

932
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,326
Come on.

933
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:53,660
Move.

934
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:09,277
Bitch!

935
01:15:44,415 --> 01:15:46,042
Where's the Controller?

936
01:17:13,963 --> 01:17:14,963
This way.

937
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:18,926
Any problems?

938
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:20,260
No problems.

939
01:17:25,516 --> 01:17:26,516
Harold.

940
01:17:33,607 --> 01:17:38,529
The kill zone's right through that door.

941
01:17:41,073 --> 01:17:43,033
Scott, guard the rear.

942
01:17:54,211 --> 01:17:55,211
We won't be a minute.

943
01:17:56,297 --> 01:17:57,965
I may start liking Surface World.

944
01:18:26,827 --> 01:18:27,827
I'll check it out.

945
01:19:15,459 --> 01:19:16,919
Welcome to the Kill zone.

946
01:19:39,984 --> 01:19:42,486
Sumai.

947
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:43,820
Welcome home.

948
01:20:11,682 --> 01:20:13,559
So why do you call this the kill zone?

949
01:20:13,892 --> 01:20:14,892
This was originally built

950
01:20:15,144 --> 01:20:16,437
to replenish the atmosphere

951
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:18,981
but a few modifications
have been made since then.

952
01:20:26,447 --> 01:20:28,115
Well I got us here.

953
01:20:29,366 --> 01:20:30,659
Yes, TC.

954
01:20:30,993 --> 01:20:31,993
You're finished.

955
01:20:32,202 --> 01:20:33,202
Ironic, isn't it?

956
01:20:33,495 --> 01:20:35,015
Your program and your father's program

957
01:20:35,331 --> 01:20:38,584
both wind down the same room.

958
01:20:38,917 --> 01:20:39,917
Come, Niki.

959
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,670
Lemme show you what real power feels like.

960
01:20:48,635 --> 01:20:49,635
It's my turn.

961
01:21:34,390 --> 01:21:36,058
This launcher contains the chemicals.

962
01:21:36,392 --> 01:21:37,466
Individually, they're inert.

963
01:21:37,476 --> 01:21:39,728
But you mix 'em together,
it's as deadly as cyanide.

964
01:21:40,062 --> 01:21:42,523
48 hours later, the effect dies out.

965
01:21:42,856 --> 01:21:44,650
And you take over Surface World.

966
01:21:44,983 --> 01:21:46,568
We take over Surface World, Niki.

967
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:48,946
But let's talk about that later.

968
01:21:58,497 --> 01:21:59,790
Lasers, you idiot.

969
01:22:00,124 --> 01:22:01,124
We're trapped.

970
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:02,960
Get outta here.

971
01:22:03,293 --> 01:22:06,505
No, Niki. You're trapped.

972
01:22:16,056 --> 01:22:16,723
Attention,

973
01:22:17,057 --> 01:22:20,060
the Surface World cleansing
sequence has been activated.

974
01:22:20,394 --> 01:22:21,474
All non-essential personnel

975
01:22:21,728 --> 01:22:23,939
must report designated safety zones.

976
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:41,915
Attention, the death launch-

977
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:46,378
- Zoey, take the elevator out.

978
01:22:46,712 --> 01:22:48,380
Zoey, what's wrong with you?

979
01:22:52,301 --> 01:22:54,553
Cameron's program really fucked you up.

980
01:22:54,887 --> 01:22:55,887
Such a shame.

981
01:23:10,944 --> 01:23:12,321
Attention, all personnel.

982
01:23:12,654 --> 01:23:14,406
You must follow specified procedures

983
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:17,159
and report to safety zones immediately.

984
01:23:18,118 --> 01:23:19,119
Death launch mechanism.

985
01:23:25,417 --> 01:23:26,877
I'm gonna Kill ya.

986
01:23:28,837 --> 01:23:29,837
I got you.

987
01:23:33,759 --> 01:23:35,135
Follow specified procedures

988
01:23:35,469 --> 01:23:37,679
and report to safety zones immediately.

989
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:40,349
Death launch mechanism has departed.

990
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:42,434
Surface World cleansing has commenced.

991
01:23:42,768 --> 01:23:44,353
They're destroying the Surface World.

992
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:45,686
I know.

993
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:49,066
Last chance, Zoey.

994
01:24:23,475 --> 01:24:24,101
Attention,

995
01:24:24,434 --> 01:24:25,754
sodium bromide has been launched.

996
01:24:59,303 --> 01:25:01,263
TC, shut the damn machine down.

997
01:25:10,647 --> 01:25:11,898
Let them hear you, Niki.

998
01:25:12,232 --> 01:25:14,026
They love a blitz.

999
01:25:14,359 --> 01:25:16,069
Insufficient time now exists

1000
01:25:16,403 --> 01:25:17,821
for travel to safety zones.

1001
01:25:18,864 --> 01:25:21,325
If you have not reported
to your designated area,

1002
01:25:21,658 --> 01:25:23,619
you must use emergency precautions now.

1003
01:25:24,578 --> 01:25:26,830
High-pressure chambers.

1004
01:25:27,164 --> 01:25:29,499
One, three, five and seven.

1005
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:36,048
Repeat: insufficient time now exists

1006
01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:38,425
for travel to safety zones.

1007
01:25:38,759 --> 01:25:41,053
If you have not reported
to your designated area,

1008
01:25:41,386 --> 01:25:43,555
you must use emergency precautions now.

1009
01:25:57,027 --> 01:25:58,278
Warning: potassium silicate

1010
01:25:58,612 --> 01:26:01,031
will be launched at two-minute mark.

1011
01:26:01,365 --> 01:26:04,910
Layer four of atmospheric
gases will be discharged.

1012
01:26:05,243 --> 01:26:08,455
Stage four of the Surface World
cleansing will be complete.

1013
01:26:13,877 --> 01:26:16,922
Open the door!

1014
01:26:36,149 --> 01:26:37,359
What's wrong, Sumai?

1015
01:26:37,693 --> 01:26:39,444
Is your little world falling apart?

1016
01:26:39,778 --> 01:26:41,279
Open the door!

1017
01:26:41,613 --> 01:26:43,031
Over my dead body.

1018
01:26:45,158 --> 01:26:47,619
You were once a great warrior, Sumai.

1019
01:26:49,871 --> 01:26:52,332
But now, you are nothing.

1020
01:27:07,097 --> 01:27:08,097
Nice punch.

1021
01:27:09,057 --> 01:27:10,057
Come on.

1022
01:27:13,437 --> 01:27:15,147
Launched at one-minute mark.

1023
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:16,720
- Damn.
- All atmospheric layers

1024
01:27:16,815 --> 01:27:17,899
will be in place

1025
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:21,820
and ready for chemical
catalysts one and three.

1026
01:27:22,154 --> 01:27:23,947
Prepare for chemical fallout.

1027
01:27:29,828 --> 01:27:31,496
Hello Niki.

1028
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:33,697
I trusted you and you
left me down there to die.

1029
01:27:33,707 --> 01:27:35,792
We'll both die if we don't get out of here!

1030
01:27:36,126 --> 01:27:36,710
But you're gonna die first.

1031
01:27:37,043 --> 01:27:38,043
No, Niki!

1032
01:27:38,170 --> 01:27:42,215
I got the antidote to the chemical.

1033
01:27:42,549 --> 01:27:43,091
No!
- Thank you.

1034
01:27:43,425 --> 01:27:44,425
Niki, no!

1035
01:27:44,676 --> 01:27:45,676
Please.

1036
01:28:04,571 --> 01:28:05,655
Your brilliant, Sumai.

1037
01:28:05,989 --> 01:28:07,657
Reflect the laser over to the right.

1038
01:28:13,246 --> 01:28:14,915
I'll take care of TC.

1039
01:28:17,334 --> 01:28:18,752
Alpha dextrine will be launched

1040
01:28:19,085 --> 01:28:20,462
in T minus five seconds.

1041
01:28:26,885 --> 01:28:28,720
Zoey, whatever happened
to partners forever?

1042
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:39,730
Jason?

1043
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:42,776
Zoey?

1044
01:28:43,109 --> 01:28:44,109
Jason?

1045
01:28:44,694 --> 01:28:45,694
Jason.

1046
01:28:51,117 --> 01:28:52,911
Atmospheric layers are in place

1047
01:28:53,245 --> 01:28:54,820
and ready for chemical catalyst number two.

1048
01:28:54,830 --> 01:28:56,206
What the hell's going on?

1049
01:28:57,457 --> 01:28:58,857
Cameron put a virus in your program

1050
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,293
to shut you down.

1051
01:29:00,627 --> 01:29:01,627
What?

1052
01:29:02,295 --> 01:29:03,463
Never mind.

1053
01:29:03,797 --> 01:29:05,580
We're at the Terminal Station
that your father built.

1054
01:29:05,590 --> 01:29:06,675
How do we stop this thing?

1055
01:29:07,634 --> 01:29:10,720
My father would've left some
sorta password or something.

1056
01:29:11,054 --> 01:29:13,306
Zoey, you're the key.

1057
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:14,766
Yeah.

1058
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:16,893
Of course, my necklace.

1059
01:29:23,108 --> 01:29:24,526
I'll input Kinsella.

1060
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:28,697
Execution of chemical-

1061
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:30,407
- Try underworld.

1062
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:31,783
Third and final catalyst

1063
01:29:32,117 --> 01:29:33,952
will be launched at mark zero.

1064
01:29:34,286 --> 01:29:37,038
Execution of all chemical
reactions will be complete

1065
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:39,249
and Surface World cleansing achieved.

1066
01:29:41,251 --> 01:29:44,754
Surface World cleansing will
commence at T minus 10 seconds.

1067
01:29:45,964 --> 01:29:48,717
10, nine, eight,

1068
01:29:49,885 --> 01:29:51,219
seven, six, five,

1069
01:29:54,306 --> 01:29:55,640
four, three, two.

1070
01:30:01,479 --> 01:30:02,479
Life.

1071
01:30:05,108 --> 01:30:07,319
Zoey is Greek for life.

1072
01:30:09,529 --> 01:30:10,906
You knew my father, didn't you?

1073
01:30:12,115 --> 01:30:13,533
He told me.

1074
01:30:16,912 --> 01:30:18,747
Let's get the hell outta here.

1075
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:20,707
TC, honey.

1076
01:30:21,041 --> 01:30:22,208
Don't leave me up here.

1077
01:30:22,542 --> 01:30:24,169
The elevator's not working.

1078
01:30:24,502 --> 01:30:25,712
Zoey, TC.

1079
01:30:26,046 --> 01:30:27,046
Jason, Jason.

1080
01:30:33,929 --> 01:30:35,513
I'll get you, Jason.

1081
01:30:40,769 --> 01:30:42,103
Beautiful, isn't it?

1082
01:30:43,146 --> 01:30:45,065
Mother Nature really is healing herself.

1083
01:30:46,274 --> 01:30:47,817
This place, not so bad.

1084
01:30:48,985 --> 01:30:50,904
And the Controller knew it all along.

1085
01:30:52,864 --> 01:30:54,199
Welcome home, partner.

1086
01:31:02,165 --> 01:31:04,417
Mother Nature was healing herself

1087
01:31:04,751 --> 01:31:06,336
and the Controller knew it.

1088
01:31:06,670 --> 01:31:09,381
It was people like him
that got us into this mess

1089
01:31:09,714 --> 01:31:11,049
in the first place.

1090
01:31:11,383 --> 01:31:14,678
But if the earth could start
anew, perhaps so could we.
