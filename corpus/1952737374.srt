1
00:05:15,595 --> 00:05:16,983
What seems to be the problem?

2
00:05:18,698 --> 00:05:22,589
My ex, will be released

3
00:05:34,614 --> 00:05:35,831
I see

4
00:05:38,785 --> 00:05:40,935
5 years have passed

5
00:05:42,322 --> 00:05:44,938
The divorce was never final

6
00:05:50,363 --> 00:05:52,012
and I feel strange

7
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:56,117
So allow yourself to show
your feelings

8
00:05:56,936 --> 00:05:59,985
Katarina, you're a beautiful woman

9
00:06:00,907 --> 00:06:04,161
Why keep in those
horrible emotions?

10
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,034
Then theres my brother

11
00:06:11,718 --> 00:06:13,674
He's so distant

12
00:06:15,288 --> 00:06:19,338
The closer I try to get to him,
the more he wants to be away

13
00:06:22,095 --> 00:06:23,175
He doesn't give me a chance

14
00:06:28,368 --> 00:06:30,791
You know what I mean doctor?

15
00:06:32,772 --> 00:06:33,921
¿Doctor?

16
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:39,057
maybe we could go out
together later on tonight

17
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:41,267
if you don't have
anything better to do

18
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:45,730
How is dad?

19
00:07:48,748 --> 00:07:49,362
Busy

20
00:07:50,817 --> 00:07:52,364
He still calls?

21
00:07:56,022 --> 00:07:57,307
Well. Does he?

22
00:08:00,193 --> 00:08:03,014
How have you been?

23
00:08:03,496 --> 00:08:04,713
Good

24
00:08:12,505 --> 00:08:14,894
My interview is this morning

25
00:09:12,565 --> 00:09:15,147
Everything is well

26
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,903
The mask please

27
00:10:48,928 --> 00:10:53,979
Its more than we agreed on.
Now give me the mask.

28
00:21:12,051 --> 00:21:13,734
Grandiose

29
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:06,985
So if I put in a musical note, this device 
will try to suggest the next note?

30
00:22:09,341 --> 00:22:10,296
Amazing

31
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:16,862
a little big but it can help 
me with the Molcik piece

32
00:22:17,883 --> 00:22:19,202
You can keep it

33
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,906
No. How could i repay it?

34
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:26,005
Keep it

35
00:22:31,063 --> 00:22:33,952
I'm worried about you and
hope you find a steady job

36
00:22:34,633 --> 00:22:36,089
Maybe at my school

37
00:22:36,802 --> 00:22:38,815
It's an honest job

38
00:22:39,271 --> 00:22:41,159
I have an honest job

39
00:22:46,712 --> 00:22:47,792
Anyway

40
00:22:51,016 --> 00:22:51,869
Thank you little brother

41
00:24:14,433 --> 00:24:16,913
I don't want you to 
come here anymore

42
00:24:18,737 --> 00:24:21,661
I hate music

43
00:24:23,909 --> 00:24:27,959
We can listen to it 
digitally at home

44
00:24:29,848 --> 00:24:32,897
I'll take out the 
parts you don't like

45
00:24:34,086 --> 00:24:38,136
But please don't send any of your strange guys ¿ok?

46
00:24:40,025 --> 00:24:44,143
I'm done working with you.
I want to find an honest job

47
00:24:53,772 --> 00:24:56,491
Don't ruin her like 
you did the rest

48
00:26:44,049 --> 00:26:46,267
I know you're worried
about your return

49
00:26:48,253 --> 00:26:49,834
Shouldn't I be?

50
00:27:09,641 --> 00:27:11,097
Don't worry

51
00:27:13,545 --> 00:27:14,898
Don't worry?

52
00:27:16,348 --> 00:27:19,237
He won't come back,
he's healthy now

53
00:39:33,184 --> 00:39:35,869
Hanna is improving fast

54
00:39:37,021 --> 00:39:40,172
I think she would be a great
help on my Molcik project

55
00:39:41,759 --> 00:39:46,207
I've never seen a 13 year old learn 
Mozart, even surpassing Mozart

56
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:53,387
Miss M, surely you aren't comparing
my daughter to Mozart?

57
00:39:56,374 --> 00:40:01,630
She has a lot of talent but she needs
to be trained and looked after

58
00:40:01,979 --> 00:40:06,029
Hanna just finished her mid-term

59
00:40:06,851 --> 00:40:07,806
Yeah?

60
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:13,170
I choose the music
of the planets

61
00:40:15,693 --> 00:40:20,676
based on the works of Pythagoras.

62
00:40:22,767 --> 00:40:29,866
He discovered those musical tones,
math and astronomy went together

63
00:43:57,448 --> 00:44:00,167
How well did you know
the girl downstairs?

64
00:44:16,133 --> 00:44:18,089
She was a sexy girl?

65
00:44:18,502 --> 00:44:22,552
Nice body? Hangin
around here?

66
00:44:32,583 --> 00:44:36,201
Yes, and what a waste
that she died so young

67
00:44:37,955 --> 00:44:40,970
Everybody would want to fuck

68
00:44:42,059 --> 00:44:45,039
and now she'll be
making necro-porn

69
00:46:22,126 --> 00:46:25,050
There's no offer registered for you.
Why did you lie to me?

70
00:46:25,763 --> 00:46:27,185
I never lied to you

71
00:46:30,401 --> 00:46:31,584
Bitch

72
00:46:32,236 --> 00:46:33,692
You're the dog

73
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:39,555
- Go to your room girl
- Go to hell asshole

74
00:48:27,184 --> 00:48:29,163
So then why?

75
00:51:14,785 --> 00:51:18,835
Most people can control their obsession,
but not with him. I'm worried

76
00:51:20,924 --> 00:51:22,004
Has he contacted us?

77
00:51:22,626 --> 00:51:22,876
No.

78
00:51:24,628 --> 00:51:29,782
Well thats divorce. It's never
good when children are involved

79
00:51:31,702 --> 00:51:34,956
No kids are involved

80
00:51:35,739 --> 00:51:37,559
But you want some, right?

81
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:43,960
I like them, 
I work with them

82
00:51:45,115 --> 00:51:46,730
and that's it

83
00:51:47,918 --> 00:51:50,569
You didn't answer my question

84
00:51:59,096 --> 00:52:05,899
I haven't thought of it.
I love my job, I love music

85
00:52:05,936 --> 00:52:09,053
So you want you own kids

86
00:52:15,479 --> 00:52:17,834
That's not the topic

87
00:52:19,049 --> 00:52:21,472
You don't find it unusual?

88
00:52:21,518 --> 00:52:25,238
Not at all

89
00:55:36,046 --> 00:55:38,526
Katarina, this is your final treatment

90
00:55:41,051 --> 00:55:42,734
It seems strange not to
be seated in the office

91
00:55:43,053 --> 00:55:45,066
This is a very special treatment

92
00:55:54,731 --> 00:55:56,050
What are you doing?

93
00:55:57,334 --> 00:55:58,653
I'm trying to fix this old phonogram

94
00:55:59,803 --> 00:56:00,758
leave it alone you idiot

95
00:56:02,005 --> 00:56:04,963
get out, get out

96
00:56:06,743 --> 00:56:09,598
Follow my movements with precision

97
00:56:12,215 --> 00:56:13,796
Put your left foot down

98
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:33,749
Step up with the right
and turn around

99
00:56:37,841 --> 00:56:39,797
Turn

100
01:05:07,383 --> 01:05:12,104
Katarina M. , at this moment
you have been suspended

101
01:05:15,258 --> 01:05:18,876
Your school needs passionate
teachers like me

102
01:05:20,196 --> 01:05:23,120
To teach the children no
matter who they are

103
01:05:23,533 --> 01:05:25,615
We can't let our culture
go down the drain

104
01:05:34,310 --> 01:05:37,234
She knows nothing of children

105
01:05:37,947 --> 01:05:43,237
I hope she gets infected with STDs

106
01:05:43,319 --> 01:05:48,268
You ruined it, you suck
too many nasty dicks

107
01:05:49,425 --> 01:05:51,404
But I'm Slovakian just like you

108
01:05:51,494 --> 01:05:54,918
You aren't a Slovak, go eat
your romanian garbage

109
01:05:55,531 --> 01:05:56,884
You've dishonored our kids here

110
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,947
Now suck my balls

111
01:15:14,423 --> 01:15:17,347
All the musical notes should
have a place in the numbers.

112
01:15:25,167 --> 01:15:26,088
Almost done

113
01:16:23,959 --> 01:16:25,130
I'll be with you

114
01:19:23,972 --> 01:19:26,805
drink, drink

115
01:33:55,076 --> 01:33:59,126
Katarina, don't give up

116
01:34:00,181 --> 01:34:02,263
don't let the concert win

117
01:34:02,984 --> 01:34:05,100
I've trained you

118
01:34:05,653 --> 01:34:07,609
You can win

119
01:34:09,257 --> 01:34:13,307
I'm in your mind.
Dig deep and remember

120
01:34:14,629 --> 01:34:16,984
Be strong

121
01:58:04,424 --> 01:58:05,846
I'm sorry

122
01:58:08,795 --> 01:58:10,717
I'm so sorry

123
01:58:13,066 --> 01:58:14,021
B and C.

124
01:58:19,806 --> 01:58:20,784
Try B and then D.

125
01:58:22,442 --> 01:58:23,488
A and G.

126
01:58:30,583 --> 01:58:31,538
No

127
01:58:31,651 --> 01:58:32,629
C and B.

128
01:58:35,755 --> 01:58:36,437
No.

129
01:58:42,829 --> 01:58:44,478
A sharp and B minor

130
01:59:03,883 --> 01:59:05,566
Katarina, follow me

131
01:59:38,818 --> 01:59:42,367
Katarina, go to the fire

132
01:59:58,471 --> 02:00:01,554
Don't forget the teachings

133
02:00:08,915 --> 02:00:12,965
Remember the notes and
unblock the code

134
02:00:13,653 --> 02:00:15,769
It's inside you

135
02:00:53,593 --> 02:00:57,643
This sequence of notes
can't be correct

136
02:01:00,733 --> 02:01:05,625
Do you have the
mini-Lecter device?

137
02:01:05,705 --> 02:01:09,755
I gave it to Hanna.
Do you still have it?

138
02:01:28,828 --> 02:01:32,776
Move the sharp chords in the
2nd movement. A C D B CE

139
02:01:40,640 --> 02:01:42,119
That's it

140
02:01:42,909 --> 02:01:44,831
Move the sharp notes now

141
02:01:44,911 --> 02:01:48,563
C B E A D

142
02:01:50,016 --> 02:01:50,903
And this?

143
02:01:51,017 --> 02:01:51,870
Correct

144
02:02:03,596 --> 02:02:04,608
Great

145
02:02:28,955 --> 02:02:32,106
Katarina, you're close,
don't ruin it

146
02:02:32,992 --> 02:02:37,042
I'm your damn father
and mother all in one

147
02:02:37,897 --> 02:02:40,115
Unblock the code and be free

148
02:02:57,850 --> 02:02:59,772
I'm the life that enters your mouth,
so you can breathe and live

149
02:03:01,721 --> 02:03:03,643
I'm the life that enters your mouth,
so you can breathe and live

150
02:03:07,193 --> 02:03:10,151
My sperm is sprayed in
your general direction

151
02:03:12,665 --> 02:03:14,053
The liberation is here

152
02:05:18,691 --> 02:05:22,468
DR. SOBESLAV, psiquiatra.
