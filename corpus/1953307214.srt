No.

11
00:01:47,383 --> 00:01:49,959
No, no that's not true,

12
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:52,689
You're the one that wanted him
to go to a private school, not me.

13
00:01:53,076 --> 00:01:55,507
Then put Knuckles on the phone.

14
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,309
Then tell him it's a two-way street,
I call him, he's gotta call me.

15
00:02:02,672 --> 00:02:04,910
Oh, he's my son now?

16
00:02:05,105 --> 00:02:08,731
Because you want him to go to...

You call me at 7 o'clock

00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,694

00:02:35,662 --> 00:02:37,753
Yeah, but how does that make me a liar?

25
00:02:39,003 --> 00:02:40,123

<i>Hello?</i>

87
00:06:59,808 --> 00:07:01,871

Hey baby, come here, how are you?

90
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:11,268
It's good to see you.
Nicole, this is Tiki Pot.

91
00:07:11,448 --> 00:07:14,136
Tiki is my partner in this new series,
he knows a lot of porn.

92
00:07:14,174 --> 00:07:15,412
Look, I have two grams.

93
00:07:15,447 --> 00:07:18,106
We are putting the narrative
back in the porn, baby, and...

94
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,563
Desdemona.

95
00:07:20,564 --> 00:07:23,671
You could totally play Desdemona.
Look at you. You're perfect.

00:07:28,263 --> 00:07:30,065
Alright, I don't do porn, Kip.

00:07:30,153 --> 00:07:32,125
- Okay, listen.
– Just... let me see the "h".

100
00:07:32,126 --> 00:07:33,380
– It's an Othello theme, okay,

101
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:36,141
the Moor comes in, finds you
in bed upon his nurses...

102
00:07:36,241 --> 00:07:38,187
And he fucks me in the ass, huh?

103
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,236
College student. Very clean. Brett?

104
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,588
Wait, we're puttin' a whole new spin on
"The beast with two backs", baby.

105
00:07:42,621 --> 00:07:43,761
In fact, that's what it's called,

106
00:07:43,792 --> 00:07:45,168
"The beast with two backs"...
– Is that why you told me

107
00:07:45,178 --> 00:07:47,785
you had somebody handling it.
– .. or "Hole-thello", or "Butt-hole thello".

108
00:07:47,816 --> 00:07:50,016
Show her the pipe, huh?

109
00:07:52,212 --> 00:07:54,010
Tiki, that's your name?

110
00:07:55,268 --> 00:07:58,461
Why n'you shove that in your ass
and you call me in the morning?

111
00:07:58,477 --> 00:08:00,165
Hey, Nicole.
Nicole!

112
00:08:00,987 --> 00:08:03,719
Hey slow down. Slow down!
Nic, I am sorry. Alright? We're tweaked.

113
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:04,972
Okay, I am sorry.

114
00:08:04,973 --> 00:08:07,072
Just stick around, it's not a big deal,

115
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:09,595
you gonna take some
stills for me or something.

116
00:08:09,627 --> 00:08:12,398
What's going on with you?
I thought you were clean?

117
00:08:12,441 --> 00:08:16,023
And now you're... you're
like freaking out on me.

118
00:08:16,694 --> 00:08:18,067
Com'on.

119
00:08:18,283 --> 00:08:19,741
Don't cry.

120
00:08:19,992 --> 00:08:21,112
I...

121
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:23,796
I just want to get faded, Kip.

122
00:08:24,813 --> 00:08:28,256
I have a hundred, please.
– No, keep it, keep it.

123
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:30,131
I don't want it, okay?

124
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,248
Listen.

125
00:08:32,497 --> 00:08:34,203
This is the 'Taliban', okay?

126
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:37,328
Very heavy, okay?
– I can handle it.

127
00:08:37,701 --> 00:08:40,503
I don't want you shooting this shit,
it's too heavy, alright?

128
00:08:40,555 --> 00:08:42,952
I won't. I promise.

129
00:08:44,756 --> 00:08:48,277
I'm just gonna smoke it out.
I haven't... used needles in weeks.

130
00:08:48,292 --> 00:08:52,585
Okay. No needles.
And if you get a little too low...

131
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,016
you just do a little coke, okay,
get yourself back up.

132
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:58,375
Right where you need to be. Alright?

133
00:08:58,486 --> 00:09:01,296
– Yeah... Thanks.
– Okay baby.

134

flight attendants, take your seat.

139
00:09:16,933 --> 00:09:19,897
So what'd you do last night?
I crashed and went straight to bed.

140
00:09:20,109 --> 00:09:21,917
All right, here we go.

141

80 knots, crosscheck.

144
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,976
It's like a video game, right?

145
00:09:36,193 --> 00:09:42,023
Nothin' like a little... 30 knot cross
wind to exercise the ol' sphincter muscle.

146
00:09:42,058 --> 00:09:43,751
E1...

147

148
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,565

See that little sliver of black
between those two ugly clouds?

167
00:10:55,992 --> 00:10:58,685

00:11:34,551 --> 00:11:36,619
we need the speed
to punch through this crap.

183
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:37,316
It's awkward.

184
00:11:37,317 --> 00:11:38,805
You're over-speeding, sir.

185
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,692

193
00:12:36,586 --> 00:12:38,716

It's a nice camera.

You know... you're like a little ghost.

201
00:13:25,215 --> 00:13:26,853
Cause you never know when you're here.

202
00:13:26,864 --> 00:13:29,557
Don't ever fucking touch my camera.
Now get out!

203
00:13:29,572 --> 00:13:32,921
Hey! Now as an building manager,
I got a legal right to enter an apartment.

204
00:13:33,347 --> 00:13:35,487
Especially if I feel the
occupant be unwell,

205
00:13:35,488 --> 00:13:37,970
and the occupant is not
current on her rent.

206
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:39,829
Just give me a minute.

207
00:13:40,504 --> 00:13:43,519
Fran, I have your rent,
I wiill bring it down to you, okay?

208
00:13:44,307 --> 00:13:46,218
Just let me take a shower.

209
00:13:46,266 --> 00:13:48,086
You shower in my house.

210
00:13:48,474 --> 00:13:51,551
You know, bring that money down,
and we shower together.

211
00:13:52,133 --> 00:13:54,880
Got that good water pressure.

212
00:13:54,987 --> 00:13:57,352
You know that, ain'ya?

213
00:13:58,842 --> 00:14:00,911
You’re in the perfect light there, Fran.

214
00:14:00,999 --> 00:14:03,594
– Yeah?
– Hmm. Back up a little.

215
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,953
Little more.

216
00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:13,134
Alright... Tricky tricky, girl.

217
00:14:13,181 --> 00:14:15,022
Now uh...

218
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,913

220
00:14:38,033 --> 00:14:40,553
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm Captain Whitaker,

221
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:44,507
if you look up, you'll see me here
in the forward galley, I waive to you.

222
00:14:46,572 --> 00:14:49,460
I want to apologize for
the bumps this morning,

223
00:14:49,461 --> 00:14:52,160
uh, evidently Florida
doesn't like us Georgians.

224
00:14:52,298 --> 00:14:56,982
Maybe it has to do with the beatin'
the Bulldogs put on the Gators last fall.

225
00:14:58,057 --> 00:15:01,038
Then I suggest to stretch out and relax,

226
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:04,021
air might be a little cranky, so we're
gonna ask that you to remain in your seat

227

with you seat belt securely
fasten around you.

228
00:15:07,077 --> 00:15:09,082

today but the flight attendants

229
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:12,051

with water and with snacks,

Hey Nicole, open up.

232
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:51,829
Fuck, Nicole. I know you're in there,
I can smell that shit cooking.

233
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:54,353
Better not you burning
down my fuckin' building!

234
00:17:00,134 --> 00:17:02,162
How can anybody sleep like that?

235
00:17:04,181 --> 00:17:05,026
I don't know.

236
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:07,701

Oh, Lord Jesus!

338
00:21:40,448 --> 00:21:42,427
– Alright Evans, flaps.
– Flaps!

339
00:21:42,508 --> 00:21:44,354
– Speed brakes.
– Speed brakes!

340
00:21:53,554 --> 00:21:55,921
Margaret. Power!

341
00:21:58,156 --> 00:22:00,485
– Gear up.
– Gear up!

342
00:22:20,051 --> 00:22:22,048
Oh Lord Jesus, we're inverted!

343
00:22:22,064 --> 00:22:24,864
Good flying lesson. We’re level,
we can maintain altitude like this.

344
00:22:25,235 --> 00:22:27,689
<i>SouthJet 2-2-7, Atlanta Center,
I see your position</i>

345
00:22:27,692 --> 00:22:29,420
<i>4 and a half miles
southeast of the airport,</i>

346
00:22:29,421 --> 00:22:30,841
<i>descending out of 1,800. Are you OK?</i>

347
00:22:30,893 --> 00:22:33,429
Atlanta Center, this is SouthJet 2-2-7,

348
00:22:33,455 --> 00:22:36,116
we are inverted, I repeat we are inverted.

349
00:22:36,132 --> 00:22:38,645
<i>SoutJet 2-2-7, did you say inverted?</i>

350
00:22:38,658 --> 00:22:41,062
We're losing oil pressure,
pump failure both engines!

351
00:22:41,076 --> 00:22:42,425
We're alright, we're flying.

352
00:22:52,901 --> 00:22:54,013
– Fire in the left engine!

353
00:22:54,014 --> 00:22:56,014
– Fire in the left engine!
– Put it out.

354
00:22:58,421 --> 00:23:01,169
I'm right with you. Look at me,
I'm right with you. Okay?

355
00:23:01,331 --> 00:23:03,998
Atlanta, SouthJet 2-2-7,
where's that airport?

356
00:23:04,031 --> 00:23:06,748
<i>2-2-7, it is one O'clock, three miles.</i>

357
00:23:06,855 --> 00:23:09,284
Alright, we're not gonna make that,
our engines are burning up.

358
00:23:09,364 --> 00:23:12,851
I see a field and a road ahead of us,
we're gonna set it down there.

359
00:23:12,894 --> 00:23:14,302
<i>Roger, 2-2-7.</i>

360
00:23:14,366 --> 00:23:15,910
Oh no, fire in the right, now!

361
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:17,621
Margaret, we're coming back around.

362
00:23:17,647 --> 00:23:21,009
Margaret, I want you to hit full power,
full throttle, you understand?

363
00:23:21,116 --> 00:23:22,742
Here we go.

364
00:23:23,007 --> 00:23:24,616
Evans, speed brakes.

365
00:23:24,968 --> 00:23:26,237
Speed brakes!

366
00:23:26,274 --> 00:23:28,390
– Flaps full.
– Flaps full.

367
00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:47,379
We're losing the left engine.

368
00:23:47,435 --> 00:23:51,310
<i>SouthJet 2-2-7, I see you descending
through 1000, do you concur?</i>

369
00:23:51,424 --> 00:23:53,526
Margaret, full power.

370
00:24:03,852 --> 00:24:05,326
We lost the left engine!

371
00:24:05,353 --> 00:24:06,201
– Let it go.

372
00:24:06,203 --> 00:24:08,162
– Let it go.
– We're losing power in the right!

373
00:24:10,405 --> 00:24:12,275
We lost all power!

374
00:24:12,393 --> 00:24:13,869
<i>TOO LOW TERRAIN</i>

375
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:15,666
<i>TOO LOW TERRAIN</i>

376
00:24:16,104 --> 00:24:17,924
<i>TOO LOW TERRAIN</i>

377
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,423
Are we gliding?

378
00:24:21,432 --> 00:24:23,892
We're in glide. Pitch for glide.

379
00:24:30,124 --> 00:24:32,124
<i>One hundred.</i>

380
00:24:37,495 --> 00:24:38,711
<i>Fifty.</i>

381
00:24:41,173 --> 00:24:42,293
<i>Forty.</i>

382
00:24:42,594 --> 00:24:43,714
<i>Thirty.</i>

383
00:24:44,201 --> 00:24:45,126
<i>Twenty.</i>

384
00:24:45,314 --> 00:24:46,886
– Brace.
- <i>Ten.</i>

385
00:24:47,098 --> 00:24:48,632
Brace for impact.

386
00:25:03,317 --> 00:25:04,963
I got the pilot.

387
00:25:04,973 --> 00:25:07,267
Somebody, give me a hand here.

388
00:25:07,916 --> 00:25:11,015
Ooh, god, god.

389
00:27:19,754 --> 00:27:21,619
Charlie Anderson?

390
00:27:28,121 --> 00:27:29,900
How you feelin', Whip?

391
00:27:32,311 --> 00:27:35,906
Initial reports look like you pulled
some kind of move up there, man.

392
00:27:36,284 --> 00:27:38,022
You saved a lot of lives.

393
00:27:39,141 --> 00:27:40,541
How many?

394
00:27:41,342 --> 00:27:43,207
On the 102 souls on board,

395
00:27:43,214 --> 00:27:46,203
including the flight crew,
96 of them survived the crash.

396
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:52,908
Six people died.
Two crew, four passengers.

397
00:27:54,878 --> 00:27:57,108
Who... who on the crew?

398
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:04,227
– Listen. The protocol is-
– Who in the crew, Charlie?

399
00:28:04,663 --> 00:28:06,829
The protocol is that the NTSB has to be

400
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,946
the first to make contact
with you, I can't...

401
00:28:09,713 --> 00:28:12,179
And their agent's here, so...

402
00:28:13,041 --> 00:28:15,394
Let me go get him, it's a bit of a show.

403
00:28:15,663 --> 00:28:19,369
So there's... half
a dozen of them. Alright.

404
00:28:22,609 --> 00:28:25,419
Hey Craig. Morning.

405
00:28:38,161 --> 00:28:40,890
Captain William Whitaker?

406
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:44,059
Nod if you can hear me and understand me.

407
00:28:44,579 --> 00:28:47,397
I'm Craig Matson of the NT... NTSB,

408
00:28:47,446 --> 00:28:49,889
and I am required as
the lead on the Go Team

409
00:28:49,897 --> 00:28:51,566
to make initial contact with you,

410
00:28:51,587 --> 00:28:54,691
after a major incident
like the one you had today.

411
00:28:55,957 --> 00:28:58,855
You are in a hospital,
in South Atlanta.

412
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:04,574
Are you aware that the plane
you were piloting went down?

413
00:29:07,403 --> 00:29:10,401
I have a doctor here who can
explain the medical situation.

414
00:29:11,532 --> 00:29:15,444
I'm Dr. Kenan. And the good news is,
you're in good condition.

415
00:29:15,855 --> 00:29:17,564
You did suffer concussion,

416
00:29:17,651 --> 00:29:20,205
you have numerous lacerations
around your left eye,

417
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:23,383
we're going to keep the patch on just
for a few days, just as a precaution.

418
00:29:23,409 --> 00:29:25,753
Your eye seems to be okay.

419
00:29:25,837 --> 00:29:28,178
Now the MRI’s show that you
have some strained tendons

420
00:29:28,194 --> 00:29:32,511
in your left knee and ankle,
and you have no broken bones,

421
00:29:32,601 --> 00:29:35,329
but you have some deep bruising
in your left thigh, and some

422
00:29:35,345 --> 00:29:38,675
torn ligaments in your
left wrist. Nothing serious.

423
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:40,950
So, as soon as we clear your concussion,

424
00:29:40,951 --> 00:29:43,261
and you feel well enough,
you can go home.

425
00:29:43,324 --> 00:29:47,496
That may take a day, maybe three.
Okay?

426
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:55,495
I won’t ask too much of you
tonight, but as I said,

427
00:29:55,666 --> 00:29:59,454
the NTSB is required
to make initial contact.

428
00:30:00,889 --> 00:30:04,319
How much do you remember about the flight?

429
00:30:06,317 --> 00:30:08,402
Uh, I remember...

430
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:13,550
I remember everything up to the crash.

431
00:30:13,717 --> 00:30:17,058
Okay... Mr. Whitaker, that’s fine.

432
00:30:17,883 --> 00:30:22,265
I am required to inform you that this
incident did result in the loss of life.

433
00:30:24,146 --> 00:30:29,331
The current information states that
of the 102 souls on board, we lost 6.

434
00:30:29,738 --> 00:30:31,986
Two crew members, and four passengers.

435
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:34,647
59 people were treated and released.

436
00:30:34,841 --> 00:30:36,019
37 people remain-

437
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,752
– Who died on the crew?

438
00:30:38,077 --> 00:30:43,706
The two flight attendants...
Camelia Satou and Katerina Marquez.

439
00:30:46,062 --> 00:30:50,286
The rep from your Pilot’s Union,
Mr. Anderson, will be our contact for you,

440
00:30:50,302 --> 00:30:55,057
it’s important that you follow your
Union’s guidance on press and media.

441
00:30:55,681 --> 00:30:58,842
The pilot’s union works
closely with the NTSB.

442
00:30:59,144 --> 00:31:04,111
So... I’m gonna head out.
Good luck, Mr. Whitaker.

443
00:31:17,052 --> 00:31:20,089
I knew Trina Marquez, she was...

444
00:31:21,292 --> 00:31:23,151
We spent some time together.

445
00:31:23,402 --> 00:31:25,919
Yeah, apparently she was not strapped in.

446
00:31:27,078 --> 00:31:30,034
Survivor reported
she was assisting a kid.

447
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:32,895
And Margaret Thomason, how's she doing?

448
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:37,440
Broken collarbone. Just, um, cuts,
I mean she's banged up, but she’s...

449
00:31:37,504 --> 00:31:39,604
she's here too, she's fine.

450
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:43,141
And Ken Evans, your copilot, he-he...

451
00:31:43,292 --> 00:31:45,527
he took a bad shot to the head.

452
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:49,396
And now they’re keepin’ him in a coma
just to let the brain swelling go down,

453
00:31:49,414 --> 00:31:52,571
but we feel good about him.
He’s gonna be okay.

454
00:31:55,855 --> 00:31:58,284
What are you doing here, Charlie?

455
00:31:59,512 --> 00:32:01,125
I’m flying a desk now.

456
00:32:01,673 --> 00:32:03,666
I’m a rep for the pilot's Union.

457
00:32:04,083 --> 00:32:05,661
You’re the rep for the pilots’?

458
00:32:05,718 --> 00:32:09,020
Yeah, I'm the one, and when your plane
went down, all the reps got a page

459
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:12,730
and I just shot up my hand cause
I know you and said I wanted to

460
00:32:12,743 --> 00:32:15,410
come and be the first face you’d see.

461
00:32:15,981 --> 00:32:17,658
I'm glad you're here.

462
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:20,566
The Union's gonna release
a statement on your behalf.

463
00:32:20,926 --> 00:32:23,474
Condolences to the families
who lost their loved ones,

464
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:26,305
gratitude to the brave men
and women of the flight crew.

465
00:32:26,856 --> 00:32:29,047
That's-you don't have to worry about that.

466
00:32:30,106 --> 00:32:32,611
And I know you and Deana have
been divorced for a while now,

467
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,248
but maybe she and your son Will gonna-

468
00:32:34,371 --> 00:32:36,124
Yes, Knuckles...

469
00:32:38,422 --> 00:32:40,154
How old is he now?

470
00:32:40,155 --> 00:32:41,885
Too old. Fifteen.

471
00:32:42,361 --> 00:32:44,490
– Fiteen? Wow.
– Yeah.

472
00:32:45,381 --> 00:32:47,802
When we flew out for Delta,
you were not even married.

473
00:32:48,435 --> 00:32:51,058
We're dinosaurs, Whip.

474
00:32:53,743 --> 00:32:56,201
Do you want me to reach out to Deana?

475
00:32:56,517 --> 00:32:59,187
And see if... she and Will
want to come down or...?

476
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,665
No, I don't want.

477
00:33:01,267 --> 00:33:02,636
I’ll call her.

478
00:33:03,099 --> 00:33:05,030
Well, speaking of which, I got your phone.

479
00:33:05,048 --> 00:33:08,663
And the whole bunch of your
personnal effect from the plane.

480
00:33:08,702 --> 00:33:10,522
Your clothes are toast.

481
00:33:12,424 --> 00:33:14,314
Uh, do you...

482
00:33:14,661 --> 00:33:18,104
Do you need me to...
to get you some stuff?

483
00:33:18,198 --> 00:33:20,195
Nah, 'bout okay.

484
00:33:20,556 --> 00:33:22,962
Charlie, I'm uh...

485
00:33:24,846 --> 00:33:27,131
Damn, I'm glad you came.

486
00:33:27,575 --> 00:33:29,535
Okay, too.
I'm happy to be here.

487
00:33:31,413 --> 00:33:35,614
Well, I'm...
I'll let you get some rest and...

488
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:37,663
but I'll come back, I mean,
you will see plenty of me.

489
00:33:37,671 --> 00:33:39,100
Sure you will.

490
00:33:41,223 --> 00:33:43,291
The plane was fucked, Charlie.

491
00:33:43,314 --> 00:33:44,814
It was doomed.

492
00:33:45,469 --> 00:33:47,190
I know.

493
00:33:48,073 --> 00:33:51,423
The way you landed that plane
was nothing short of a miracle.

494
00:33:51,798 --> 00:33:53,198
You know that.

495
00:33:56,012 --> 00:33:57,711
Alright, Captain.

496
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,022
– Good night.
– Good night.

497
00:34:50,856 --> 00:34:53,673
I'm on the list, baby girl.
Mr. Mays...

498
00:34:54,488 --> 00:34:56,491
Harling.

499
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:03,267
If this is gonna turn into a sponge bath,
I’ll come back later.

500
00:35:03,292 --> 00:35:04,412
Sir...

501
00:35:04,813 --> 00:35:08,021
It's alright, honey. I'm on the list.
Harling Mays.

502
00:35:08,092 --> 00:35:10,192
Some say they Harling knew me.

503
00:35:10,439 --> 00:35:14,271
Honey, could you hustle us a couple
of daiquiris, and a cocktail weenie?

504
00:35:14,335 --> 00:35:16,848
On second thought just bring the
booze, I brought my own weenie.

505
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:18,945
Ah, well she's offended
and she should be.

506
00:35:19,078 --> 00:35:21,178
I’m a pig.
And I hate me.

507
00:35:21,232 --> 00:35:25,214
That’s what we have in common
Nurse Ratched. We both hate me.

508
00:35:26,954 --> 00:35:28,045
Harling Mays.

509
00:35:28,389 --> 00:35:32,475
Whip, what the fuck my man?

510
00:35:33,167 --> 00:35:37,127
They’re sayin’, “Sweet Jesus,
what a stud that pilot is.”

511
00:35:37,162 --> 00:35:38,276
You’re a hero, man.

512
00:35:38,479 --> 00:35:41,797
You will never pay for
another drink as long as you live.

513
00:35:41,886 --> 00:35:44,066
There is all kind o' those
crazy news people out here,

514
00:35:44,067 --> 00:35:45,829
it's a fucking circus, man.

515
00:35:45,844 --> 00:35:48,336
Come on, check this shit out,
man, it's all for you.

516
00:35:49,074 --> 00:35:50,829
Look at this shit.

517
00:35:51,095 --> 00:35:53,117
Classic hero worship shit.

518
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:57,406
You're a rock star, man.
Oh, check out this video.

519
00:35:57,458 --> 00:35:59,636
This's outside your condo.
It's a zoo.

520
00:35:59,686 --> 00:36:01,524
It crowded with reporters.

521
00:36:01,555 --> 00:36:02,568
Let's see, check this out.

522
00:36:02,578 --> 00:36:03,929
Let's see, check this out.
<i>So you do know Captain Whitaker,</i>

523
00:36:03,936 --> 00:36:04,531
- <i>you were friends?</i>
– Com'on.

524
00:36:04,547 --> 00:36:05,316
<i>Oh yeah.</i>

525
00:36:05,317 --> 00:36:06,447
<i>Yes, he's my brother.</i>

526
00:36:06,463 --> 00:36:07,583
<i>Yes, he's my brother.</i>
– That's me.

527
00:36:07,592 --> 00:36:10,496
And that‘s Mark Mellon, you know
that douchey talking haircut from

528
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,897
local Atlanta channel 12?
I said a few words,

529
00:36:12,905 --> 00:36:14,670
you know most of ‘em straight talk.

530
00:36:15,249 --> 00:36:16,369
Oh!

531
00:36:16,789 --> 00:36:17,976
You okay, Captain Whitaker?

532
00:36:17,984 --> 00:36:20,398
The meds they’re giving me,
they're messing me up, I’m all...

533
00:36:20,427 --> 00:36:22,875
shaky and dried out, I can’t sleep good.

534
00:36:22,891 --> 00:36:25,045
Yeah. What the hell kind
of meds they give you?

535
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,107
Alprazolam.

536
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:31,433
That's generic Xanax. Hydroconon,
that's generic Vicodin. It's shit.

537
00:36:31,454 --> 00:36:34,240
Prolly Canadian.
We don't want this shit.

538
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,961
We want the premium stuff, blue label.
Not this fucking well shit.

539
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:40,323
I mean, where's the...
where’s the dihydromorphinone?

540
00:36:40,326 --> 00:36:42,479
Or at least some fucking
Palladone, for Christ sake,

541
00:36:42,496 --> 00:36:45,345
is this amateur architect doctor in here
you just saved some 100 people-

542
00:36:45,384 --> 00:36:47,449
Harling!

543
00:36:47,569 --> 00:36:48,926
You bring my smokes?

544
00:36:49,022 --> 00:36:52,460
Yes I did, I got your fucking message,
and yes I got your fucking smokes.

545
00:36:52,683 --> 00:36:55,359
Right here...
Here's a fresh carton.

546
00:36:55,659 --> 00:36:57,436
You smoke your nuts off, champion.

547
00:36:57,454 --> 00:37:00,069
Hell if I was you, I'd fire a brat
here in this goddamn room.

548
00:37:00,108 --> 00:37:03,223
Here. I got you a pint of vodka,
I got you some Red Bull,

549
00:37:03,232 --> 00:37:04,968
you know what I'm saying,
I know my customer.

550
00:37:04,999 --> 00:37:06,150
Take the vodka with you.

551
00:37:06,151 --> 00:37:07,898
What? Take the vodka,
what d'you-

552
00:37:07,903 --> 00:37:09,562
I'm not drinking anymore,
take it with you.

553
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:10,669
Are you ins... I'll just tuck-

554
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:11,701
– Take the fucking vodka with you.

555
00:37:11,709 --> 00:37:12,582
– Take the fucking vodka with you.
– Okay.

556
00:37:12,982 --> 00:37:15,425
Listen mate, you got to
come to get me tomorrow.

557
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,680
Okay?

558
00:37:19,433 --> 00:37:21,986
I want you to go by my condo...

559
00:37:22,487 --> 00:37:26,289
pick me up some clothes,
and uh, my phone charger.

560
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:30,419
Look in my refridgerator, and pick up
a package that says "veal" on it.

561
00:37:30,545 --> 00:37:31,794
– It's marked. Veal.

562
00:37:31,795 --> 00:37:32,417
– It's marked. Veal.
– Veal.

563
00:37:32,418 --> 00:37:33,865
In the freezer's, marked veal.

564
00:37:33,896 --> 00:37:35,682
Done and done.
What time you want me here?

565
00:37:35,699 --> 00:37:37,401
– I call you.
– Okay. You give me mayday,

566
00:37:37,413 --> 00:37:39,470
and you’re outta here in 7 minutes.
Oh!

567
00:37:39,773 --> 00:37:42,419
Oh, almost forgot,
I got you some stroke mags,

568
00:37:42,481 --> 00:37:44,534
I've been in a hospital before,
I know what you need,

569
00:37:44,584 --> 00:37:47,284
I got Juggs, Hot MILFS in heat,
Assmasters,

570
00:37:47,355 --> 00:37:49,455
you just stroke it all day,
you're a hero.

571
00:37:49,621 --> 00:37:53,663
If I was here, I'd just lay here
pullin'on that thing all day long,

572
00:37:53,664 --> 00:37:57,484
you know what I'm saying,
there's a smile... yessir.

573
00:38:58,998 --> 00:39:01,632
Devious minds think alike.

574
00:39:03,204 --> 00:39:04,982
Don't go.

575
00:39:06,399 --> 00:39:08,489
I'll be quiet, it is...

576
00:39:09,234 --> 00:39:13,702
nice to... just sit and
smoke with somebody.

577
00:39:19,904 --> 00:39:21,799
Were you on that plane?

578
00:39:22,776 --> 00:39:24,015
Yeah, why?

579
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,605
You?

580
00:39:26,838 --> 00:39:29,103
You must have been sittin' at the back.

581
00:39:32,013 --> 00:39:34,259
Yeah... by the back.

582
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:36,830
<i>Tobacco's but an Indian weed,</i>

583
00:39:37,072 --> 00:39:39,220
<i>Grows green in the morn, cut down at eve</i>

584
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:42,068
<i>It shows our decay, we are but clay.</i>

585
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:46,395
Ah, I love the smell
of nicotine in the mornin'!

586
00:39:47,862 --> 00:39:49,453
It smells like victory!

587
00:39:50,438 --> 00:39:52,258
Can't buy more.

588
00:39:55,919 --> 00:39:57,763
I should quit.

589
00:39:58,367 --> 00:40:01,267
My cancer might get cancer.

590
00:40:05,118 --> 00:40:06,797
In the plane crash?

591
00:40:06,798 --> 00:40:08,122
You are...

592
00:40:10,099 --> 00:40:13,159
Holy shit, man!
You're the fucking pilot!

593
00:40:14,192 --> 00:40:16,713
Huh, what happened out there?

594
00:40:17,587 --> 00:40:19,596
Okay.
Yeah, I-hmm...

595
00:40:19,825 --> 00:40:21,814
Tough deal, man, but you, uh...

596
00:40:22,155 --> 00:40:24,728
You walked away.
You limped away.

597
00:40:25,184 --> 00:40:28,564
Yeah, I'm lucky.
Goin’ home tomorrow.

598
00:40:28,698 --> 00:40:29,818
Home...

599
00:40:30,083 --> 00:40:31,698
Home for me is the basement...

600
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,932
They keep cancer treatment
in the basement.

601
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:36,128
What kind of cancer you have?

602
00:40:36,314 --> 00:40:39,507
Fibro-mixzoid sarcoma.
Soft tissue sarcoma.

603
00:40:39,563 --> 00:40:41,897
Very rare. God chose me.

604
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:44,689
You believe in Him?

605
00:40:45,223 --> 00:40:48,770
Fuck yeah bitch, you’re a stupid
fucker if you don’t believe in God.

606
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:51,478
Once you realize all the
random events in your life are God,

607
00:40:51,496 --> 00:40:54,001
you will live a much easier life.

608
00:40:54,395 --> 00:40:57,728
You spend all your time trying to control
all these things that happen to us.

609
00:40:57,767 --> 00:40:58,689
Bullshit.

610
00:40:59,044 --> 00:41:01,800
The plane you’re flying goes down?
Out of your control.

611
00:41:01,835 --> 00:41:04,529
God gives you cancer.
I got no control over that.

612
00:41:04,911 --> 00:41:08,315
Did God give me cancer?
You bet your ass God gave me cancer.

613
00:41:08,403 --> 00:41:11,392
You know, you think God would have
given me cancer if I had asked for it?

614
00:41:11,439 --> 00:41:15,280
Well I don't think so, cause I begged him
to take it away, and guess what?

615
00:41:16,636 --> 00:41:19,221
No control over that either.

616
00:41:20,324 --> 00:41:21,892
What are you doing here, honey?

617
00:41:22,103 --> 00:41:24,053
You're beautiful, you know that?

618
00:41:25,276 --> 00:41:27,291
Do I scare you?

619
00:41:28,358 --> 00:41:32,231
People either are drawn to me,
or they pretend that they can’t see me.

620
00:41:33,969 --> 00:41:35,089
It’s a trip...

621
00:41:35,122 --> 00:41:37,036
They think that because I'm
getting close to the other side,

622
00:41:37,058 --> 00:41:39,040
I got some sort of power or wisdom.

623
00:41:39,267 --> 00:41:40,821
Like I got all the answers.

624
00:41:40,978 --> 00:41:42,883
I don't know, maybe I do.

625
00:41:43,892 --> 00:41:46,045
Death gives you perspective.

626
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,709
It all makes sense somehow.

627
00:41:47,851 --> 00:41:50,583
And I just can’t get over
how beautiful you are!

628
00:41:52,091 --> 00:41:53,724
I can see your arm.

629
00:41:53,788 --> 00:41:55,420
You're an addict?

630
00:41:57,162 --> 00:41:57,895
Yeah.

631
00:41:58,886 --> 00:42:00,463
What's your name?

632
00:42:01,582 --> 00:42:03,090
Nicole.

633
00:42:03,955 --> 00:42:05,983
What d'you do in the world, Nicole?

634
00:42:06,304 --> 00:42:07,704
Not much.

635
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,104
I was a photographer and
then I was a masseuse,

636
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:14,469
and now I... I sometimes
wash hair at a salon.

637
00:42:14,524 --> 00:42:16,344
Oh yeah? Where is it?

638
00:42:16,761 --> 00:42:20,454
I will come by, I’m really easy,
you just wash my head.

639
00:42:22,537 --> 00:42:24,515
You think you’re gonna die?

640
00:42:36,135 --> 00:42:37,824
Don’t you just love her?

641
00:42:38,773 --> 00:42:40,008
I don't know her.

642
00:42:40,009 --> 00:42:42,622
Bullshit. I do.

643
00:42:43,744 --> 00:42:45,639
Random Act of God?

644
00:42:45,866 --> 00:42:47,686
I don’t think so.

645
00:42:48,044 --> 00:42:51,999
You survive a plane crash and meet
a beautiful woman in a stairwell...

646
00:42:52,976 --> 00:42:55,303
Fuck you, man.

647
00:42:58,026 --> 00:42:59,771
Probably looking for me.

648
00:43:00,609 --> 00:43:02,153
My family just flew in from Utah.

649
00:43:02,161 --> 00:43:04,412
You know it’s bad when
they start flying in.

650
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:08,807
It is a trip.

651
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:11,627
With every morning special now.

652
00:43:12,112 --> 00:43:14,172
I am greateful for that.

653
00:43:14,377 --> 00:43:16,867
I wish I could bottle
this feelin' that I have...

654
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,347
about how beautiful
every last breath of life is.

655
00:43:24,686 --> 00:43:26,785
Yeah, I get one more just for the road?

656
00:43:26,935 --> 00:43:29,378
Here. Take the pack.

657
00:43:34,072 --> 00:43:35,314
Thank you.

658
00:43:35,421 --> 00:43:37,629
I’ll pass these out in the cancer ward.

659
00:43:38,732 --> 00:43:39,980
Nicole...

660
00:43:40,397 --> 00:43:41,613
you’re gonna be okay.

661
00:43:48,484 --> 00:43:50,493
Chemo brain...

662
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:53,598
It makes you pretty foggy.

663
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:54,572
Oh, yeah?

664
00:43:54,804 --> 00:43:56,544
They call it chemo brain.

665
00:43:57,099 --> 00:44:00,444
My mom, she used to slur
her words and get all chatty.

666
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,224
Your mom had cancer?

667
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:06,534
Breast cancer, she was only 54.

668
00:44:07,955 --> 00:44:10,157
Is that why you think you gonna die?

669
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:16,053
Heroin addicts who're usin' needles,
they tend to die.

670
00:44:16,741 --> 00:44:20,602
Especially women for some reason,
I have read in a pamphlet.

671
00:44:22,061 --> 00:44:25,916
A woman from AA, she just came
to see me while I was in rea.

672
00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:30,651
That guy was a trip, uh?

673
00:44:30,919 --> 00:44:31,846
– Yeah.

674
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:34,742
He made it feel like, I dunno...

675
00:44:35,569 --> 00:44:39,355
like you and me were
the last people left on this planet.

676
00:44:40,762 --> 00:44:44,517
And together we'll... save the world.

677
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:58,649
Where d'you live, Nicole?

678
00:44:58,844 --> 00:45:01,929
Why, you wanna come to visit me?
It's luxurious.

679
00:45:02,712 --> 00:45:04,971
I live in Bankhead, near the bus station.

680
00:45:05,474 --> 00:45:06,799
I'll come to visit you.

681
00:45:07,011 --> 00:45:07,922
You're sweet.

682
00:45:08,085 --> 00:45:09,325
I will.

683
00:45:10,059 --> 00:45:11,606
What’s your address?

684
00:45:13,121 --> 00:45:16,498
I live at the Georgian Terraces...
on Taylor street.

685
00:45:16,525 --> 00:45:17,645
Okay.

686
00:45:18,322 --> 00:45:21,529
You say you're a masseuse.
What kind of masseuse?

687
00:45:22,262 --> 00:45:25,274
I've been every kind of masseuse there is.

688
00:45:28,155 --> 00:45:29,809
Good luck, Nicole.

689
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:39,606
I couldn't find any suitcases.
I put all your shit in garbage bags.

690
00:45:39,607 --> 00:45:40,851
No, thanks.

691
00:45:43,779 --> 00:45:46,522
You’re stayin’ with me
down on University, right?

692
00:45:46,634 --> 00:45:51,397
Hey it’s nice... A lotta young people...
Good vibe.

693
00:45:52,462 --> 00:45:55,045
No, I’m gonna go to the farm.

694
00:45:55,854 --> 00:45:57,758
The farm?

695
00:45:58,062 --> 00:46:00,380
I can’t stay at my condo.

696
00:46:00,902 --> 00:46:02,899
I thought you sold your Dad's place.

697
00:46:03,009 --> 00:46:04,403
Not yet.

698
00:46:06,427 --> 00:46:08,726
I’m not sure I wanna stay at the farm.

699
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:12,499
You’re not. You're gonna drive me
to the airport so I can pick-up my car.

700
00:46:13,829 --> 00:46:14,878
Veal?

701
00:46:15,379 --> 00:46:16,499
Really?

702
00:47:31,784 --> 00:47:36,006
<i>Captain Whitaker, this is Jim Court,
I’m with CNN. We'd like to-</i>

703
00:47:36,246 --> 00:47:39,496
<i>This is NBC affiliate in Athens.
We're looking to-</i>

704
00:50:31,981 --> 00:50:35,081
<i>In the wake of the deadly
crash of SouthJet Flight 2-2-7,</i>

705
00:50:35,181 --> 00:50:38,836
<i>we have more questions than answers
as to what exactly happened that day,</i>

706
00:50:38,936 --> 00:50:41,199
<i>and like many, we are
around looking for answers.</i>

707
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:44,597
<i>Looking here at the home of
pilot, captain Whip Whitaker.</i>

708
00:50:44,783 --> 00:50:47,720
<i>Still have no signs of him
coming to his condo....</i>

709
00:50:47,755 --> 00:50:51,140
<i>This is Bart Malles still on the hunt
and looking down for answers.</i>

710
00:50:51,175 --> 00:50:55,204
<i>You’ve reached the Whitaker Crop Dusting
Company, flying lessons and plane rides.</i>

711
00:50:55,248 --> 00:50:58,818
<i>Please leave a message and
it will be returned. Thank you.</i>

712
00:51:00,293 --> 00:51:03,350
<i>Hey, cowboy. Charlie again.</i>

713
00:51:03,467 --> 00:51:06,832
<i>Look, I'm back in town and... I
stopped by at the hospital tonight,</i>

714
00:51:06,842 --> 00:51:11,191
<i>but, uh... they said you'd gone home,
so you must be feeling pretty good.</i>

715
00:51:11,721 --> 00:51:15,226
Uh... Listen, I went, uh... at your condo

716
00:51:15,236 --> 00:51:17,625
and the manager said
you had not returned, so...

717
00:51:17,903 --> 00:51:20,108
you maybe with relatives,
which I understand,

718
00:51:20,143 --> 00:51:23,226
but I know you have a doctor's appointment
early in the morning for your eye,

719
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:26,240
and I was just hoping that
you could meet us for breakfast,

720
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:30,156
'bout ten o'clock at St Regis,
there is an executive buffet there,

721
00:51:30,336 --> 00:51:33,700
And we'll be covering some
pretty important stuff, so...

722
00:51:34,108 --> 00:51:35,988
it'd be nice to have you there.

723
00:51:36,215 --> 00:51:38,173
Alright. Be good.

724
00:52:04,201 --> 00:52:07,512
Oh, there he is. Hey Whip,
hey buddy. Man, you loog good!

725
00:52:07,532 --> 00:52:09,284
I feel-Thanks for coming,
I'm glad you got my message.

726
00:52:09,316 --> 00:52:10,985
How is your eye?
– Good. Goog, good.

727
00:52:11,042 --> 00:52:13,094
Here's Hugh Lang,
he's an attorney from Chicago.

728
00:52:13,117 --> 00:52:14,817
– Pleasure to meet you, Captain.
– My pleasure.

729
00:52:14,841 --> 00:52:17,108
– Sit down. You wanna coffee?
– Uh, yes I do.

730
00:52:17,143 --> 00:52:19,219
Could we have some fresh coffee?

731
00:52:19,518 --> 00:52:22,845
We were just talking about
your copilot’s wife.

732
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:25,620
She told a newspaper
that “God landed that plane”.

733
00:52:25,855 --> 00:52:28,225
Yeah? God?

734
00:52:28,433 --> 00:52:29,876
Well, I too believe God landed the plane,

735
00:52:29,888 --> 00:52:33,008
same way I believe God should hit the
buffet, the turkey sausage is excellent.

736
00:52:33,337 --> 00:52:35,451
No, I’m fine with coffee, thank you.

737
00:52:35,745 --> 00:52:38,020
So Len Caldwell really wanted
to get here this morning,

738
00:52:38,027 --> 00:52:39,493
Len's the president of the pilots’ union,

739
00:52:39,494 --> 00:52:41,470
he wanted to be here to
meet with us, and you,

740
00:52:41,769 --> 00:52:43,885
but they needed him at the crash site.

741
00:52:44,046 --> 00:52:45,840
So as you know, when a plane goes down,

742
00:52:45,856 --> 00:52:49,200
the NTSB sends a “go team”
to the crash site immediately.

743
00:52:49,235 --> 00:52:50,912
They find the flight data recorders?

744
00:52:50,954 --> 00:52:54,569
– They did, it's perfectly intact.
- Oh, great, then that solves everything.

745
00:52:54,944 --> 00:52:58,201
So. Why do we need a lawyer from Chicago?

746
00:52:58,281 --> 00:53:01,919
Well... Hugh specializes
in criminal negligence.

747
00:53:01,966 --> 00:53:03,786
– Criminal negligence?
– Hmm-hmm.

748
00:53:04,164 --> 00:53:05,975
Death demands responsibility.

749
00:53:05,993 --> 00:53:08,357
Six dead on that plane,
someone has to pay.

750
00:53:08,376 --> 00:53:10,744
Yeah, but that's a plane
that fell apart at...

751
00:53:10,745 --> 00:53:12,608
think it fell apart at 30 thousand feet.

752
00:53:12,809 --> 00:53:15,199
And the airline will try to
prove equipment failure.

753
00:53:15,299 --> 00:53:18,210
Which is gonna make the manufacturer
responsible, the manufacturer in turn

754
00:53:18,226 --> 00:53:21,013
is gonna try and prove poor maintenance
of the equipment by the airline.

755
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:22,341
Or pilot error.

756
00:53:24,474 --> 00:53:27,436
I flew the plane inverted,
that means upside down, Hugh.

757
00:53:27,471 --> 00:53:31,273
You get the picture? A hundred people
upside down, 500 feet off the ground.

758
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:33,177
You have any idea what that's like?

759
00:53:33,281 --> 00:53:36,161
I do. I, uh... heard the
black box recordings last night.

760
00:53:36,188 --> 00:53:38,115
Oh you heard. So you're a pilot?

761
00:53:38,326 --> 00:53:39,256
No, no.

762
00:53:39,284 --> 00:53:40,826
Then you know what the fuck
you're talking about, do you?

763
00:53:40,849 --> 00:53:41,956
Hugh's on our team, Whip.

764
00:53:41,964 --> 00:53:42,893
– Is he?
– Yeah, he is,

765
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:44,000
– He didn' act like he gonna
– obviously...

766
00:53:44,008 --> 00:53:45,321
– have to imagine me questions
– well, he is, yeah but...

767
00:53:45,326 --> 00:53:46,571
– like a fucking pilot,
– Listen to me,

768
00:53:46,585 --> 00:53:47,844
– and that he knows something.
– it's the NTSB's ball game.

769
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:51,655
They run the investigation, and
they will ultimately rule on the cause.

770
00:53:51,779 --> 00:53:53,671
And that's why we need him.
– Well, they...

771
00:53:53,797 --> 00:53:56,318
interview the entire flight
crew, they...

772
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,982
interview the passengers,
they... hold public hearings.

773
00:54:00,368 --> 00:54:03,295
Hey, let's cut to the chase, what...
just tell me what I need to know, Charlie.

774
00:54:03,298 --> 00:54:08,655
The NTSB 'go-team' also collects
blood, hair, and skin samples

775
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:12,720
from the entire flight crew for the
purposes of a toxicological report.

776
00:54:12,829 --> 00:54:15,542
Okay... When do they want to do that?

777
00:54:15,738 --> 00:54:18,105
They've already done that.
In the hospital.

778
00:54:18,292 --> 00:54:20,397
That's the first thing they do.

779
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:23,685
You don't remember having your
blood drawn the night of the crash?

780
00:54:23,873 --> 00:54:25,107
– No.
– No?

781
00:54:30,213 --> 00:54:32,671
They get the results of these...
these tests?

782
00:54:32,835 --> 00:54:34,252
Yeah, they do.

783
00:54:35,299 --> 00:54:36,726
Anything else for you, gentlemen?

784
00:54:36,781 --> 00:54:40,450
Yeah, uh... you have warm
cinnamon bums over there.

785
00:54:40,467 --> 00:54:42,700
Could you give me one of those, please.
In fact give me only two bums.

786
00:54:42,723 --> 00:54:44,121
– Yes sir, comin'up.
– Thank you, sweetie.

787
00:54:44,309 --> 00:54:45,429
Now...

788
00:54:45,785 --> 00:54:48,157
An initial report shows that...

789
00:54:48,195 --> 00:54:53,084
you had alcohol in your system...
uh, at a level of .2 4.

790
00:54:53,108 --> 00:54:55,254
Now...
in the good old U.S.,

791
00:54:55,269 --> 00:54:58,519
a very one of the most lenient
drunk driving countries in the world,

792
00:54:58,570 --> 00:55:02,208
you go to jail for driving
with anything above .0 8.

793
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:05,116
And by driving, I mean a car.

794
00:55:05,825 --> 00:55:07,731
Thank you.
Well...

795
00:55:07,858 --> 00:55:10,277
so that was... don't mean anything,

796
00:55:10,286 --> 00:55:12,215
a couple of beers the
night before the flight,

797
00:55:12,237 --> 00:55:13,910
would that make the tail
of the plane explode?

798
00:55:13,926 --> 00:55:16,322
– Couple of beers?
– Yeah, couple of beers.

799
00:55:16,555 --> 00:55:18,081
You know, I need a lawyer, Charlie.

800
00:55:18,082 --> 00:55:19,722
– Hugh is your lawyer.
– I need a bigger lawyer.

801
00:55:19,723 --> 00:55:22,418
I need a layer that understands that
someone put me on a broken plane,

802
00:55:22,436 --> 00:55:25,379
without me up there, there
would be a 102 funerals, not six.

803
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:27,184
We're not talking about
funeral right now, Captain.

804
00:55:27,307 --> 00:55:27,721
– Well then, what are we talking about?

805
00:55:27,722 --> 00:55:29,376
– Well then, what are we talking about?
– We're talking about prison time.

806
00:55:30,237 --> 00:55:31,461
– What?
– Lawsuits.

807
00:55:32,558 --> 00:55:33,078
Somebody has to pay.

808
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:34,451
Somebody has to pay.
– What, I write a check?

809
00:55:34,486 --> 00:55:36,548
I'ts not gonna be me, I promise you that.

810
00:55:36,588 --> 00:55:39,094
As long as they're writing checks,
tell them they write one for me too.

811
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:43,119
Because someone put me in a broken plane.
I'd love a check, Charlie.

812
00:55:43,189 --> 00:55:46,186
This toxicology report states
that you were drunk.

813
00:55:46,254 --> 00:55:48,654
And high on cocaine.

814
00:55:48,812 --> 00:55:51,384
Felony's punishable by up
to 12 years in prison.

815
00:55:51,484 --> 00:55:54,708
And if it is proven that your intoxication
was the cause of the death

816
00:55:54,729 --> 00:55:57,843
of four passengers, now we're gonna
look at four counts of manslaughter.

817
00:55:58,623 --> 00:56:00,934
That could be life in prison.

818
00:56:01,442 --> 00:56:04,676
Now can I please do my job your behalf...

819
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:08,122
and kill this tox report?

820
00:56:12,525 --> 00:56:14,093
He's gonna get it done, Whip.

821
00:56:14,179 --> 00:56:16,136
He'll get it done, it's what
his whole life's about,

822
00:56:16,137 --> 00:56:18,280
trust me, trust him.

823
00:56:20,397 --> 00:56:22,616
You don't have to worry,
you'll walk away from this-

824
00:56:22,617 --> 00:56:24,113
I am not worried, Charlie.

825
00:56:25,547 --> 00:56:27,667
I promise you that I'm not worried.

826
00:56:27,744 --> 00:56:30,927
No one could have landed
that plane like I did.

827
00:56:32,184 --> 00:56:33,711
No one.

828
00:56:40,044 --> 00:56:41,733
– Thanks for coming.
- Yeah.

829
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,633
Excuse me.

830
00:56:45,314 --> 00:56:47,061
– Excuse me.
– Yeah?

831
00:56:47,117 --> 00:56:50,546
Yeah, let me have a...
orange juice, large orange juice.

832
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:52,685
Just orange juice?

833
00:56:53,146 --> 00:56:54,545
Yeah, uh...

834
00:56:54,655 --> 00:56:56,326
No. Uh...

835
00:56:57,495 --> 00:56:58,820
Double Stoli.

836
00:56:59,298 --> 00:57:00,418
Neat.

837
00:57:00,695 --> 00:57:04,793
<i>.. to me anyway, of a real American hero.
Is that your reading of it?</i>

838
00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:09,643
<i>Absolutely. However, remember
every situation is different.</i>

839
00:57:09,688 --> 00:57:12,912
<i>And the actions of the pilots
of SouthJet 2-2-7</i>

840
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,631
<i>will be heavily scrutinized.</i>

841
00:57:14,785 --> 00:57:17,978
<i>Are you suggesting that there may
be more to this that leans behind?</i>

842
00:57:17,979 --> 00:57:22,063
<i>They're all answers. We don't have all of
the answers, we have a lot of questions.</i>

843
00:57:22,094 --> 00:57:25,594
<i>We're gonna have to wait until
some of those answers come in before...</i>

844
00:58:10,793 --> 00:58:13,526
The next morning...

845
00:58:15,181 --> 00:58:17,001
They're not gonna shot me...

846
00:58:18,178 --> 00:58:21,074
Aah, Taylor street.

847
00:59:10,224 --> 00:59:11,042
<i>Get out.</i>

848
00:59:11,043 --> 00:59:14,315
<i>The guy in Unit 1 just told me
you stayed here last night!</i>

849
00:59:16,901 --> 00:59:19,553
<i>What about my rent?
You owe me money, bitch.</i>

850
00:59:19,641 --> 00:59:21,513
– Don't touch me, Fran.
– Listen, I'm gonna...

851
00:59:21,537 --> 00:59:24,558
– Fuck, you will listen to me...
– Fran, get off me Frankie, you're...

852
00:59:25,182 --> 00:59:27,265
.. the fuck are you doin'?
Fuck off, man.

853
00:59:27,289 --> 00:59:29,880
Keep your fucking hands off her!

854
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:36,648
Are you okay?

855
00:59:37,723 --> 00:59:40,288
Sorry, is this... is this
all the rest of your stuff?

856
00:59:40,657 --> 00:59:41,587
Uh, yeah.

857
00:59:41,736 --> 00:59:43,603
She still owe me 1100 dollars.

858
00:59:43,704 --> 00:59:45,793
Plus damages...
– Get out!

859
00:59:47,727 --> 00:59:49,647
What, you wanna sue her?

860
00:59:49,710 --> 00:59:53,014
Spend a 1000 bucks, or you wanna make
a cash deal with me? Make up your mind.

861
00:59:53,797 --> 00:59:55,270
Make up your mind!

862
00:59:56,521 --> 00:59:58,948
I take 700 cash.

863
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:02,067
You're a hairy little creep, aren't you?

864
01:00:02,590 --> 01:00:04,570
Baseball bat bullshit.

865
01:00:08,828 --> 01:00:12,338
700 my ass. Here's 400 cash.

866
01:00:12,452 --> 01:00:14,510
Now be a good boy.

867
01:00:14,739 --> 01:00:17,377
Grab that box, put it in her car.

868
01:00:17,534 --> 01:00:19,813
Uh... but my car don’t run.

869
01:00:19,946 --> 01:00:22,766
It didn't start this morning,
I'm taking all this with me.

870
01:00:23,171 --> 01:00:24,973
– Your car doesn't run?
– Hmm-hmm.

871
01:00:26,066 --> 01:00:28,063
Well, what you're gonna do?

872
01:00:28,822 --> 01:00:30,222
Well I...

873
01:00:31,438 --> 01:00:33,890
I don't know what I was gonna do.

874
01:00:59,997 --> 01:01:01,821
What's your name?

875
01:01:02,274 --> 01:01:03,453
Whip.

876
01:01:08,141 --> 01:01:09,935
What?

877
01:01:10,885 --> 01:01:13,078
That's funny?

878
01:01:19,129 --> 01:01:20,437
Thank you.

879
01:01:21,571 --> 01:01:23,150
Captain Whip.

880
01:01:39,095 --> 01:01:40,047
You Okay?

881
01:01:40,352 --> 01:01:42,467
– Yeah. And you?
– Yeah.

882
01:01:42,713 --> 01:01:45,158
– You wan' a drink?
– No, thanks.

883
01:01:47,718 --> 01:01:50,223
Sure it's alright that I stay here?

884
01:01:50,310 --> 01:01:53,314
– Yes, it's alright that you stay here.

885
01:01:53,659 --> 01:01:55,836
I want you to stay.

886
01:01:58,112 --> 01:01:59,766
That knee hurtin' you?

887
01:02:00,516 --> 01:02:03,170
Yes is it.
Yes, sweetie.

888
01:02:09,991 --> 01:02:12,304
Thank you, Doctor.

889
01:02:14,395 --> 01:02:16,961
– It’s throbbing within...
– Yeah.

890
01:02:16,962 --> 01:02:20,539
Cos it's having a hard time
getting back to your heart.

891
01:02:29,234 --> 01:02:31,434
That's good though.

892
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:50,647
You gonna shoot me?

893
01:03:50,648 --> 01:03:53,066
Or can I come inside?

894
01:03:53,067 --> 01:03:56,073
Yeah, come on inside, I shoot you inside.

895
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:02,947
Listen, I... I thought we'd take a ride,
there's some I need to show you.

896
01:04:05,143 --> 01:04:06,543
I'm good.

897
01:04:12,241 --> 01:04:14,238
There it is.

898
01:04:15,533 --> 01:04:20,148
You can see... on initial impact,
the left wing hit the ground.

899
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:22,350
I think if it would have
sheared off completely,

900
01:04:22,351 --> 01:04:24,087
everybody would have walked
away from this plane.

901
01:04:24,849 --> 01:04:27,324
Wing snapped off and it jaw opened the...

902
01:04:27,889 --> 01:04:31,832
engine cowling into the... rear fuselage.

903
01:04:31,871 --> 01:04:32,991
Yeah.

904
01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:35,910
If you were sitting in the last
six or seven rows it was...

905
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:37,699
like being hit by a train.

906
01:04:39,016 --> 01:04:40,069
Who are they?

907
01:04:40,134 --> 01:04:42,987
The John the Baptist Pentecoastal Mission.

908
01:04:43,147 --> 01:04:45,098
They helped pull survivors
out of the wreckage.

909
01:04:45,099 --> 01:04:47,452
Now they come out here every day.

910
01:04:56,082 --> 01:04:59,301
And that is Ellen Block.

911
01:04:59,823 --> 01:05:01,632
She is the head of the NTSB investigation.

912
01:05:01,633 --> 01:05:04,667
She's the one that's gonna be
asking you the tough questions.

913
01:05:05,191 --> 01:05:07,931
I night the night before the flight.
I drank that morning too,

914
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:10,394
I used cocaine to help
straighten myself up.

915
01:05:11,245 --> 01:05:13,806
I know.
It's in the toxicology report.

916
01:05:13,807 --> 01:05:16,553
And it's not the reason why this happened.

917
01:05:17,109 --> 01:05:18,789
No, it's not.

918
01:05:19,943 --> 01:05:21,063
Listen.

919
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:24,900
Clearly there was a mechanical
issue with the plane.

920
01:05:24,970 --> 01:05:27,304
– Clearly.
– Yeah. But what you and I know...

921
01:05:28,085 --> 01:05:30,381
This was an "Act of God".

922
01:05:31,524 --> 01:05:34,494
And I'm gonna fight to get
the NTSB to add "Act of God"

923
01:05:34,495 --> 01:05:37,373
as one of the probable causes.

924
01:05:37,374 --> 01:05:40,176
Who’s God would do this?

925
01:05:51,358 --> 01:05:55,308
Here’s the deal. Avington Carr,
is the owner of the airline,

926
01:05:55,332 --> 01:05:59,004
He's on our side.
He's got big friends in Washington too.

927
01:05:59,827 --> 01:06:02,756
He wants to have a sit down with us
tomorrow morning at ten o'clock.

928
01:06:03,434 --> 01:06:05,254
– Really?
– Yeah.

929
01:06:05,859 --> 01:06:07,826
You can't drink, Captain.

930
01:06:09,417 --> 01:06:12,870
You're under the microscope right now.
You can't be seen buy a liquor.

931
01:06:13,012 --> 01:06:15,704
That means no bars... no drugs.

932
01:06:15,728 --> 01:06:17,986
– I understand. I won't drink,
I promise you.

933
01:06:18,697 --> 01:06:20,421
– Look, we can get you help...
– I don't need help-

934
01:06:20,429 --> 01:06:22,272
I won't drink, I promise you.

935
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:25,171
I can stop. On my own.

936
01:06:25,732 --> 01:06:27,552
– Okay.
– Okay.

937
01:06:31,681 --> 01:06:33,844
– So ten O'clock-
– Ten O'clock, I got it.

938
01:06:33,845 --> 01:06:35,715
Avington Car.

939
01:06:36,216 --> 01:06:38,721
I never wanted that fucking airline.

940
01:06:38,863 --> 01:06:41,911
Neither did my brother.
It was my father that wanted it.

941
01:06:42,097 --> 01:06:43,399
I like baseball.

942
01:06:43,522 --> 01:06:44,719
– Oh, I like baseball.
– Everyone likes to watch baseball.

943
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:46,397
Everybody enjoys to like baseball.

944
01:06:46,398 --> 01:06:47,708
– The whole country likes baseball.

945
01:06:47,709 --> 01:06:48,981
– The whole country likes baseball.
– Cut the crap.

946
01:06:50,186 --> 01:06:52,699
So... what's the deal, Lenny?

947
01:06:52,824 --> 01:06:55,301
Is your union gonna survive this one?

948
01:06:55,597 --> 01:06:58,969
More importantly, how big a check
you think I’m gonna have to write?

949
01:06:58,981 --> 01:07:01,541
Well, you had six fatalities
on board your aircraft.

950
01:07:01,573 --> 01:07:04,398
No no, it's four, Lenny.
The two crew members don't count.

951
01:07:07,004 --> 01:07:08,329
I don't mean they don't count.

952
01:07:08,330 --> 01:07:10,492
They don't get settlements
like the passengers.

953
01:07:10,602 --> 01:07:13,672
Yeah, that’s a workman’s comp claim,
part of the union contract.

954
01:07:14,115 --> 01:07:17,192
They do dangerous job, they know it.

955
01:07:17,746 --> 01:07:19,751
You’re the lawyer for the pilots’ union?

956
01:07:19,767 --> 01:07:23,124
No sir, this is Hugh Lang, he's
the attorney we brought on

957
01:07:23,133 --> 01:07:25,708
to handle the criminal side of
Captain Whitaker’s situation.

958
01:07:27,690 --> 01:07:30,589
Yes, and what is Mr. Whitaker's situation?

959
01:07:30,981 --> 01:07:34,939
NTSB is up my ass with a flashlight,
we had to give them access to everything.

960
01:07:35,242 --> 01:07:37,290
Everbody's curious about Captain Whitaker.

961
01:07:37,333 --> 01:07:40,502
Well I flew with him in the Navy
and he is a great pilot.

962
01:07:40,729 --> 01:07:41,849
Huh.

963
01:07:43,091 --> 01:07:44,487
Is he a drunk?

964
01:07:48,516 --> 01:07:51,178
He's a heavy drinker.
But maybe I should bring in him?

965
01:07:51,202 --> 01:07:52,602
In a minute.

966
01:07:53,255 --> 01:07:55,694
Alright, so let’s get down to it, Lenny.

967
01:07:56,122 --> 01:07:59,854
What does the union plan to do
about this blood test saying

968
01:08:00,091 --> 01:08:02,713
Whitaker was high on booze and coke?

969
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:04,502
This guy’s a real peach.

970
01:08:04,718 --> 01:08:06,895
I'm gonna kill the toxicology report.

971
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:10,861
The testing was done incompetently.

972
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:15,942
The toxicology equipment they used
was last calibrated in June of 2009.

973
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:18,672
It's already 18 months past code.

974
01:08:18,946 --> 01:08:23,069
Their log that should clearly state
who labeled the blood vials and when,

975
01:08:23,086 --> 01:08:27,029
is very incomplete, and they used a
preservative in the blood

976
01:08:27,102 --> 01:08:29,841
that has been known to cause fermentation,

977
01:08:30,081 --> 01:08:33,159
and in some cases register
higher in an alcohol test.

978
01:08:33,169 --> 01:08:36,802
Now, I have done all this, I've
only been here a few days. So...

979
01:08:36,859 --> 01:08:39,076
I wouldn't worry about it too much,
I can handle this.

980
01:08:39,573 --> 01:08:40,995
I like this guy, Lenny.

981
01:08:41,206 --> 01:08:44,190
Makes me wanna go out
sniff a few lines and fly a jet.

982
01:08:44,582 --> 01:08:45,698
Mr. Carr,

983
01:08:45,699 --> 01:08:49,673
we’re gonna fight to push all the fault
on the manufacturer, Jackson Ridgefield.

984
01:08:49,819 --> 01:08:53,285
And you think they’re gonna just open
their check book and buy us all lunch?

985
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:55,315
Good fucking luck.

986
01:08:56,008 --> 01:08:57,478
What’s my exposure Jim?

987
01:08:58,854 --> 01:09:01,547
Well, the awards to the
families could kill the airline.

988
01:09:01,569 --> 01:09:02,707
Fuck the airline.

989
01:09:02,729 --> 01:09:04,829
The insurance companies
can have the goddamm airline.

990
01:09:04,923 --> 01:09:07,063
I just don’t want them come
sniffing in my other pockets.

991
01:09:07,088 --> 01:09:11,327
Speaking for the pilots’ union, sir,
we don’t want to see your airline go away.

992
01:09:11,328 --> 01:09:13,235
We enjoy the contract you have with us.

993
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:16,968
We gonna protect Captain Whitaker,
and in turn we gonna protect your airline.

994
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:21,603
Does... Whitaker know he's goin' to jail?

995
01:09:22,273 --> 01:09:24,343
My client isn't goin' to jail, Mr. Carr.

996
01:09:24,382 --> 01:09:27,182
Oh, he's goin' to jail.
He belongs in jail.

997
01:09:27,292 --> 01:09:30,032
Bet your ass he's goin' to jail,
the only question is...

998
01:09:30,088 --> 01:09:32,122
is he gonna die in jail?

999
01:09:32,123 --> 01:09:34,156
You are wrong, Mr. Carr.

1000
01:09:34,519 --> 01:09:37,741
Last time I checked, six counts
of manslaughter, it's life in prison.

1001
01:09:38,469 --> 01:09:40,060
Life in prison...

1002
01:09:40,498 --> 01:09:43,716
What we in Georgia call “all day long”.

1003
01:09:51,650 --> 01:09:53,882
I hear you're some kind o' pilot.

1004
01:10:20,634 --> 01:10:23,491
Theeere she is, there she is.

1005
01:10:23,522 --> 01:10:27,553
Back to the meet?
Had a nice meeting?

1006
01:10:30,567 --> 01:10:32,953
I know, it's okay, uh?

1007
01:10:36,557 --> 01:10:37,957
It's okay...

1008
01:10:38,724 --> 01:10:40,606
Yup, that's it.

1009
01:10:47,063 --> 01:10:48,183
Me?

1010
01:10:50,227 --> 01:10:51,627
That's it.

1011
01:10:52,748 --> 01:10:55,146
Am I-No.
Yeah, no.

1012
01:11:05,026 --> 01:11:07,945
<i>You wanna run the boy, you wanna be
a quarterback, let me see you run it back!</i>

1013
01:11:08,219 --> 01:11:10,750
<i>So say "Dowdow", say "Kwakwa"!</i>

1014
01:12:41,356 --> 01:12:43,818
– Good morning.
– Hello.

1015
01:12:48,848 --> 01:12:51,103
You were in really
bad shape last night.

1016
01:12:51,189 --> 01:12:54,306
Yeah, true...
just tired.

1017
01:12:57,025 --> 01:12:59,686
Drank a little bit too much.

1018
01:12:59,906 --> 01:13:01,026
A bit?

1019
01:13:02,614 --> 01:13:05,307
What, you won't count the fucking beers?

1020
01:13:05,476 --> 01:13:06,984
I threw ‘em out.

1021
01:13:08,086 --> 01:13:09,911
They're in the garbage, vodka too.

1022
01:13:11,891 --> 01:13:13,470
Is that okay with you?

1023
01:13:13,714 --> 01:13:14,934
More than okay.

1024
01:13:19,918 --> 01:13:22,791
I’ve been watching the sky
change as the sun rises.

1025
01:13:24,889 --> 01:13:26,472
Beautiful.

1026
01:13:27,339 --> 01:13:30,252
I went out there, I took some great shots.

1027
01:13:35,015 --> 01:13:37,769
It's just so beautiful here.

1028
01:13:38,583 --> 01:13:40,214
You grew up here?

1029
01:13:40,448 --> 01:13:42,563
No, Dad did.

1030
01:13:45,578 --> 01:13:47,747
It's my grandfather's farm.

1031
01:13:50,617 --> 01:13:51,646
Was.

1032
01:13:53,435 --> 01:13:57,925
Dad was a pilot, he was a...
332nd airbone. He was a...

1033
01:13:58,175 --> 01:14:00,823
Tuskee, he built that
landing strip out there.

1034
01:14:02,508 --> 01:14:07,568
Crop dustin'. EPA shut him down, he...
traded the crop duster for...

1035
01:14:08,306 --> 01:14:11,671
that old Cesna sittin'
out there in the barn.

1036
01:14:13,822 --> 01:14:17,483
He flew that damn thing
all over the place.

1037
01:14:20,165 --> 01:14:23,780
He died... I got divorced, and...

1038
01:14:26,497 --> 01:14:29,010
been trying to sell the place ever since.

1039
01:14:31,397 --> 01:14:33,168
What about your mom?

1040
01:14:33,677 --> 01:14:35,004
Dead.

1041
01:14:37,622 --> 01:14:39,237
You? What about your Dad?

1042
01:14:40,016 --> 01:14:42,818
Well, I'm pretty sure he...
lives in Colorado.

1043
01:14:42,967 --> 01:14:44,087
Yeah?

1044
01:14:45,355 --> 01:14:46,829
No relationship?

1045
01:14:47,702 --> 01:14:49,813
It was my mom that raised me.

1046
01:14:49,814 --> 01:14:51,341
She was incredible.

1047
01:14:52,814 --> 01:14:56,468
She held it together for so long,
I couldn’t tell how sick she was.

1048
01:14:59,099 --> 01:15:02,441
We spent those last seven months
together like we were teenagers.

1049
01:15:04,786 --> 01:15:08,929
We traded stories about
boys and... whatever.

1050
01:15:12,222 --> 01:15:14,103
Oh, she loved me.

1051
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:33,166
My name's Trevor.

1052
01:15:33,658 --> 01:15:35,980
You saved my mom.

1053
01:15:48,101 --> 01:15:49,570
– It's great to see you, Whip.

1054
01:15:49,571 --> 01:15:51,442
– It's great to see you, Whip.
– It's good to see you too.

1055
01:15:57,568 --> 01:15:59,308
The service was so nice.

1056
01:15:59,418 --> 01:16:02,114
I mean, all those people
who wanted to say goodbye.

1057
01:16:04,155 --> 01:16:07,340
And Trina looked so beautiful in there.
Don't you think you?

1058
01:16:08,037 --> 01:16:11,683
I mean, like she was gonna...
wake up and smile!

1059
01:16:11,987 --> 01:16:15,375
I didn’t go in, Margaret.
I... I just couldn’t.

1060
01:16:16,798 --> 01:16:17,889
Trevor...

1061
01:16:18,592 --> 01:16:21,795
Find daddy, baby.
He's over there with Mr. Benton.

1062
01:16:28,851 --> 01:16:31,129
You really should come
to the counseling group.

1063
01:16:31,287 --> 01:16:33,433
The Union has great
people for us to talk to.

1064
01:16:33,459 --> 01:16:35,792
I can't.
Really I...

1065
01:16:36,824 --> 01:16:37,944
I will.

1066
01:16:41,344 --> 01:16:43,375
– Yeah. Well...
– Margaret.

1067
01:16:45,165 --> 01:16:46,267
– You take care, okay, Whip?

1068
01:16:46,268 --> 01:16:47,139
– You take care, okay, Whip?
– Okay.

1069
01:16:47,795 --> 01:16:49,983
Listen, Margaret, I have a...

1070
01:16:51,894 --> 01:16:54,246
You know, I'm in
the middle of this, uh...

1071
01:16:55,269 --> 01:16:58,822
investigation. The NTSB
is investigating the crash.

1072
01:16:58,852 --> 01:17:00,502
Yeah, I'm gonna talk to ‘em next week.

1073
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:04,306
Yeah. Well, I-I-
I'm a little nervous because...

1074
01:17:05,513 --> 01:17:09,263
I was out the night
before the crash, the diner-

1075
01:17:09,293 --> 01:17:10,230
Yeah. With Katerina.

1076
01:17:10,272 --> 01:17:14,827
Right. And I had two glasses of wine,
and they're probably gonna ask you

1077
01:17:14,936 --> 01:17:17,488
about my condition that morning, or

1078
01:17:17,489 --> 01:17:20,289
whether you thought
I had anything to drink.

1079
01:17:23,835 --> 01:17:25,282
What?

1080
01:17:28,419 --> 01:17:30,362
I've known you eleven years, Whip.

1081
01:17:30,448 --> 01:17:31,303
Right.

1082
01:17:31,585 --> 01:17:36,017
You want to tell me that you and Trina went
to diner and you had two glasses of wine,

1083
01:17:36,026 --> 01:17:38,070
sounds like a nice restaurant,
now which one was it?

1084
01:17:38,124 --> 01:17:41,004
You have to say that it was
an ordinary day, Margaret.

1085
01:17:41,025 --> 01:17:44,574
I mean, it was an ordinary day.
You know me, I was in shape to fly.

1086
01:17:49,477 --> 01:17:51,584
You have a problem saying that?

1087
01:17:53,321 --> 01:17:56,108
It's a lie, Whip... It's a lie.

1088
01:17:56,246 --> 01:17:58,752
Trina told me you two
hadn't been to sleep.

1089
01:17:58,792 --> 01:18:01,344
Well, the... my lack of
sleep had nothing to do

1090
01:18:01,361 --> 01:18:03,477
with that plane falling apart, Margaret.

1091
01:18:03,873 --> 01:18:06,345
I'm just trying to get these things
straight, now you think any other pilot

1092
01:18:06,346 --> 01:18:08,300
could have landed that plane
and saved more lives?

1093
01:18:08,313 --> 01:18:09,235
I didn't say that, Whip,

1094
01:18:09,251 --> 01:18:10,371
– Alright, then...
– I can't imagine another pilot...

1095
01:18:10,392 --> 01:18:14,757
Imagine your son Trevor in this
church looking at you in that box,

1096
01:18:14,766 --> 01:18:18,045
or my son visiting me in prison,
and for the next forty years-

1097
01:18:18,056 --> 01:18:20,343
Please, Whip, enough.
Enough, Whip.

1098
01:18:20,368 --> 01:18:22,552
Don't you think we've all had enough?

1099
01:18:30,357 --> 01:18:32,120
I need this, Margaret.

1100
01:18:39,637 --> 01:18:41,596
What d'you want me to say?

1101
01:18:43,540 --> 01:18:44,967
I just...

1102
01:18:46,541 --> 01:18:48,218
It was an ordinary day.

1103
01:18:50,875 --> 01:18:54,404
The storm... after we took off...

1104
01:18:54,715 --> 01:18:56,708
was very severe.

1105
01:18:57,970 --> 01:19:00,967
But as far as the flight crew
is concerned, it was a...

1106
01:19:01,890 --> 01:19:03,990
a perfectly ordinary day.

1107
01:19:30,444 --> 01:19:31,793
You okay?

1108
01:19:31,861 --> 01:19:33,512
Uh yeah, yeah.

1109
01:19:34,311 --> 01:19:35,724
So?

1110
01:19:35,926 --> 01:19:38,626
Well, I got through the first day,
they didn-t fire me,

1111
01:19:38,689 --> 01:19:40,089
so...
– Then?

1112
01:19:40,309 --> 01:19:43,244
And they need someone to work
the night shift, and they asked me,

1113
01:19:43,351 --> 01:19:45,424
it’s time and a half so...

1114
01:19:47,030 --> 01:19:48,840
I got a vest...

1115
01:19:49,653 --> 01:19:51,887
and a... well, name tag,
I got you something.

1116
01:19:51,987 --> 01:19:53,807
– Yeah?
– Yeah.

1117
01:19:53,901 --> 01:19:55,301
Thank you.

1118
01:19:58,053 --> 01:19:59,036
– It is a P-51 mustang.

1119
01:19:59,037 --> 01:20:00,473
– It is a P-51 mustang.
– I know it's a P-51.

1120
01:20:00,504 --> 01:20:01,201
– Your daddy fly one of these?

1121
01:20:01,202 --> 01:20:02,214
– Your daddy fly one of these?
– Yes, he did.

1122
01:20:03,602 --> 01:20:05,545
It cause for celebration.

1123
01:20:05,571 --> 01:20:08,787
Oh well, I promised Sheila that
I'd go to this AA meeting now.

1124
01:20:09,231 --> 01:20:11,054
She's my sponsor, the one
that's been helping me,

1125
01:20:11,057 --> 01:20:12,484
can we celebrate tomorrow night?

1126
01:20:13,470 --> 01:20:14,569
Yeah.

1127
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:17,155
Yeah sure, why not?

1128
01:20:20,966 --> 01:20:23,920
You know, you can come with me...
to the meeting.

1129
01:20:24,161 --> 01:20:26,793
It's an open meeting,
meaning that anyone can come.

1130
01:20:27,695 --> 01:20:28,736
Even you!

1131
01:20:30,545 --> 01:20:32,902
So the cops got a flashlight on
me behind the dumpster, I'm...

1132
01:20:32,921 --> 01:20:34,620
I'm wearing nothing but
my girlfriend’s panties,

1133
01:20:34,634 --> 01:20:36,694
I got vomitin' on the
front of my chest,

1134
01:20:37,546 --> 01:20:41,327
and I say to him:
"Uh... I might have had two beers."

1135
01:20:48,388 --> 01:20:50,907
So that's why I get the nickname:
"Two-Beer Barry".

1136
01:20:53,794 --> 01:20:56,463
I'm getting the, uh... the
stink eye from Ed over here,

1137
01:20:56,479 --> 01:20:58,065
have I gone off format?

1138
01:20:59,363 --> 01:21:01,688
My name is Barry and I'm an alcoholic.

1139
01:21:01,814 --> 01:21:03,095
Hi Barry.

1140
01:21:03,154 --> 01:21:06,237
Are there any other alcoholics present?

1141
01:21:11,547 --> 01:21:14,637
I always love a meeting where
we all have to identify the tab,

1142
01:21:14,646 --> 01:21:18,135
because it forces me to be
honest about who I really am.

1143
01:21:19,772 --> 01:21:24,325
And I never told the truth out there,
obviously I lied about everything.

1144
01:21:25,826 --> 01:21:28,865
I was told in these rooms that
I was never sober if I kept lying,

1145
01:21:28,873 --> 01:21:30,618
but that's what I was best at.

1146
01:21:33,325 --> 01:21:35,612
If I knew anything in this
world, it was how to lie,

1147
01:21:35,619 --> 01:21:38,938
especially about my drinking.
But...

1148
01:21:39,148 --> 01:21:42,371
whatever, I would lie about
the name of my dog,

1149
01:21:42,372 --> 01:21:45,635
I'd lie about the color of my
own hair right to your face.

1150
01:21:47,311 --> 01:21:52,535
My whole life just became... a series
of lies, strung together by me,

1151
01:21:52,556 --> 01:21:53,936
I gotta go.

1152
01:21:54,342 --> 01:21:55,462
Sure.

1153
01:21:55,935 --> 01:21:58,573
Oh yeah, Sheila, she can
give me a ride, does she?

1154
01:21:59,252 --> 01:22:00,372
I'm Sheila.

1155
01:22:20,655 --> 01:22:24,348
<i>I’ve been speaking to some people who
are very close to the NTSB investigation,</i>

1156
01:22:24,358 --> 01:22:27,637
<i>and they are confident they will
soon be able to determine exactly</i>

1157
01:22:27,639 --> 01:22:29,238
<i>what brought this plane down.</i>

1158
01:22:29,245 --> 01:22:31,814
<i>I'm sure they will, sir.</i>

1159
01:22:31,815 --> 01:22:34,835
<i>Well, Ken and Vicki Evans,
thank you very much.</i>

1160
01:22:34,851 --> 01:22:37,732
<i>Thank you sir. God bless you.</i>

1161
01:22:50,034 --> 01:22:52,290
How you feeling, Ken?

1162
01:22:54,053 --> 01:22:55,762
I'm happy to be alive.

1163
01:22:55,844 --> 01:22:58,034
Blessed... to be alive.

1164
01:23:00,370 --> 01:23:03,320
I'm Captain Whitaker, I was...
flying the-

1165
01:23:03,331 --> 01:23:04,717
I know who you are.

1166
01:23:06,166 --> 01:23:09,476
Excuse me. Can you give us
some privacy, please?

1167
01:23:09,547 --> 01:23:11,060
Thank you.

1168
01:23:22,477 --> 01:23:24,584
So, uh...

1169
01:23:24,842 --> 01:23:26,662
How long have you been out of the...

1170
01:23:27,025 --> 01:23:28,865
– Out of the coma?
– Yeah.

1171
01:23:29,682 --> 01:23:31,077
Two days.

1172
01:23:35,825 --> 01:23:39,447
Well, uh, look, I don't wanna...
disrupt your whole day,

1173
01:23:40,378 --> 01:23:45,219
God knows you've been...
swamped by interviews, and...

1174
01:23:46,774 --> 01:23:49,709
You looked brillant on the CNN,
by the way.

1175
01:23:50,279 --> 01:23:53,942
Both my legs are crushed.
My pelvis is snapped.

1176
01:23:54,842 --> 01:23:59,345
I'll probably never walk again.
Al least not without a walker or braces.

1177
01:24:00,431 --> 01:24:02,632
I'll certainly never fly again.

1178
01:24:03,841 --> 01:24:05,437
I'm very sorry, Ken.

1179
01:24:06,163 --> 01:24:09,395
That plane was doomed
the moment you sat in that cockpit.

1180
01:24:10,147 --> 01:24:13,189
You reeked like gin or somethin’.

1181
01:24:13,614 --> 01:24:16,414
I called Vicki from the plane
before we took off.

1182
01:24:17,831 --> 01:24:20,343
That’s when the rain kicked up.

1183
01:24:21,717 --> 01:24:25,769
Well, I don’t know how much
you remember, but...

1184
01:24:26,393 --> 01:24:27,961
that plane...

1185
01:24:28,430 --> 01:24:30,266
it started falling apart, Ken.

1186
01:24:30,416 --> 01:24:33,109
I remember everything until the crash.

1187
01:24:33,394 --> 01:24:34,999
I know what went wrong.

1188
01:24:37,374 --> 01:24:40,387
What are you trying to say, Ken?
What do we talk?

1189
01:24:41,322 --> 01:24:44,569
I do not know, Captain Whitaker.
What are we talking about?

1190
01:24:44,597 --> 01:24:47,842
I'm just trying to get a sense from you...

1191
01:24:48,843 --> 01:24:52,645
about what you thought caused the crash.

1192
01:24:53,944 --> 01:24:57,941
Was it the fact that you got on the
plane still drunk from the night before?

1193
01:24:59,789 --> 01:25:03,818
The NTSB is coming back tomorrow
to finish taking a deposition from me...

1194
01:25:05,024 --> 01:25:06,873
about the events on that flight.

1195
01:25:07,305 --> 01:25:11,443
Do you think you... be alive
if I wasn't flying that plane?

1196
01:25:12,703 --> 01:25:13,708
No.

1197
01:25:14,736 --> 01:25:16,393
We'd all be dead.

1198
01:25:17,158 --> 01:25:21,015
But you gonna argue with me
that your physical state was tip-top?

1199
01:25:26,570 --> 01:25:27,820
Wait.

1200
01:25:28,469 --> 01:25:29,654
Sit...

1201
01:25:30,427 --> 01:25:31,741
Please.

1202
01:25:37,430 --> 01:25:40,326
I never shared my opinion
about your physical state...

1203
01:25:40,733 --> 01:25:42,560
the morning of the flight.

1204
01:25:43,567 --> 01:25:44,994
I never said a word.

1205
01:25:47,527 --> 01:25:49,744
That crash was pre-ordained.

1206
01:25:51,149 --> 01:25:53,029
I prayed on it, Captain.

1207
01:25:53,210 --> 01:25:55,256
Vicky and I both prayed on it.

1208
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:57,560
There's only one judge, sir.

1209
01:25:57,678 --> 01:25:59,013
Praise Jesus!

1210
01:25:59,225 --> 01:26:01,332
And he's got a higher plan for you.

1211
01:26:02,419 --> 01:26:06,613
This event... although it's
tragic in his loss of life...

1212
01:26:08,597 --> 01:26:10,900
it's also a celebration of life.

1213
01:26:11,911 --> 01:26:14,791
Nothing happens in the kingdom
of the Lord by mistake, sir.

1214
01:26:14,793 --> 01:26:16,407
Praise Jesus!

1215
01:26:16,498 --> 01:26:17,812
Captain...

1216
01:26:19,045 --> 01:26:20,504
Will you pray with us?

1217
01:26:32,855 --> 01:26:36,905
Jesus, our Savior, we thank you
for blessing Captain Whitaker.

1218
01:26:36,906 --> 01:26:40,283
For guiding his hand
on that fateful morning.

1219
01:26:41,525 --> 01:26:43,202
– Bye.
– It's on the right.

1220
01:26:43,261 --> 01:26:45,194
– Thanks for the ride.
– Okay.

1221
01:27:09,425 --> 01:27:10,949
Oh hey, look.

1222
01:27:11,770 --> 01:27:13,336
Great, ain't it?

1223
01:27:13,498 --> 01:27:14,524
It's kind of beautiful.

1224
01:27:14,525 --> 01:27:16,308
It is beautiful, I know, like you.

1225
01:27:16,342 --> 01:27:18,566
– Does it work?
– Yes it works.

1226
01:27:18,697 --> 01:27:20,929
I learned how to fly on this baby.

1227
01:27:21,220 --> 01:27:24,655
Me and my friend Holling, we...
we flew to Jamaica.

1228
01:27:24,849 --> 01:27:26,078
– Jamaica, in this?

1229
01:27:26,079 --> 01:27:27,524
– Jamaica, in this?
– Yeah, in this.

1230
01:27:27,797 --> 01:27:30,294
We went on a overnight fishing trip about

1231
01:27:30,497 --> 01:27:32,880
two hours south to here,
and next thing you know,

1232
01:27:33,225 --> 01:27:34,763
Bethel, Jamaica.

1233
01:27:35,770 --> 01:27:37,792
– You're insane.
– Yes, I am.

1234
01:27:38,069 --> 01:27:40,809
It was beautiful, just like a... postcard,

1235
01:27:40,817 --> 01:27:44,080
you know, one of those
gipsy postcards with...

1236
01:27:44,096 --> 01:27:47,785
white sand, beautiful... sky, blue sea.

1237
01:27:49,112 --> 01:27:51,008
It's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.

1238
01:27:52,850 --> 01:27:55,542
Was the water warm?

1239
01:27:55,723 --> 01:27:56,970
Yes, that was very warm.

1240
01:27:57,072 --> 01:27:58,192
That’s my kind of place.

1241
01:27:59,939 --> 01:28:01,126
Let's go.

1242
01:28:02,072 --> 01:28:03,389
Sure, why not.

1243
01:28:04,757 --> 01:28:06,215
Yeah, let's go tomorrow.

1244
01:28:06,837 --> 01:28:07,829
Oh, you're serious?

1245
01:28:07,861 --> 01:28:11,046
I'm very serious. We go in the morning.
You know, let's just get out of here.

1246
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:12,825
To start over.
– Wait, we can't-

1247
01:28:12,856 --> 01:28:15,869
Yes we can, it will be beautiful,

1248
01:28:16,050 --> 01:28:17,735
these light bright sand beaches, it's-

1249
01:28:17,759 --> 01:28:19,397
– I'm worried about you.
– It's paradise.

1250
01:28:19,409 --> 01:28:21,383
Don't worry about me, I'm fine, thank you.

1251
01:28:21,413 --> 01:28:23,754
– Whip, you're not, you're really not.
– Yes I am...

1252
01:28:23,755 --> 01:28:24,889
I am.
– You need help.

1253
01:28:26,342 --> 01:28:28,081
You need rehab, Whip.

1254
01:28:30,268 --> 01:28:34,062
Is it-I mean, so you go to two
AA meetings and I need...?

1255
01:28:34,578 --> 01:28:35,492
Okay.

1256
01:28:35,543 --> 01:28:38,993
Hey look, I won't-Jesus Christ,
don't worry about me, okay?

1257
01:28:39,020 --> 01:28:41,910
You just worry about yourself,
don't worry about me.

1258
01:28:42,181 --> 01:28:44,170
– We're the same, you and me.
– No, we're not the same,

1259
01:28:44,178 --> 01:28:45,545
– Yeah we are.
– we are not the same,

1260
01:28:45,553 --> 01:28:47,217
I don't suck dick to get high, okay?

1261
01:28:47,281 --> 01:28:49,560
Don't give me that "your mother died..."
– I never...

1262
01:28:49,568 --> 01:28:51,152
– and your father...
– I never in my life...

1263
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:53,198
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.

1264
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:54,164
Is that why you shot dope?

1265
01:28:54,165 --> 01:28:54,979
Is that why you shot dope?
– That's not fair.

1266
01:28:54,986 --> 01:28:56,400
That's why you get high?

1267
01:28:56,487 --> 01:28:58,547
There’s a whole lot of people
out there whose mother died,

1268
01:28:58,555 --> 01:28:59,507
they don't fucking drink.

1269
01:28:59,508 --> 01:29:00,078
they don't fucking drink.
– You're sick.

1270
01:29:00,087 --> 01:29:02,766
Yeah, well I'll die and brace it, shit!

1271
01:29:03,884 --> 01:29:05,567
– I choose to drink.
– You do?

1272
01:29:05,599 --> 01:29:06,985
– Yes I do.
– You choose it, well

1273
01:29:06,986 --> 01:29:08,644
I don't see a whole lot
of choice going on here.

1274
01:29:08,646 --> 01:29:12,324
I choose to drink, and I blame myself.
I'm happy to.

1275
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:16,158
And you know why?
Because I choose to drink.

1276
01:29:16,837 --> 01:29:20,178
I got an... ex-wife and
a son I never talk to.

1277
01:29:21,018 --> 01:29:24,343
And you know why?
Because I choose to drink!

1278
01:29:26,219 --> 01:29:27,339
Nicole.

1279
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:46,444
Hey. Listen.

1280
01:29:50,863 --> 01:29:52,197
Alright, look...

1281
01:29:54,805 --> 01:29:58,568
I was loaded when... the plane crashed.

1282
01:29:59,594 --> 01:30:01,810
With this investigation, I don't
know what's gonna happen,

1283
01:30:01,826 --> 01:30:03,873
I could go to jail
for the rest of my life.

1284
01:30:05,467 --> 01:30:07,426
I gotta get outta here.

1285
01:30:09,635 --> 01:30:11,702
And I want you to come with me.

1286
01:30:13,304 --> 01:30:14,424
Whip.

1287
01:30:19,473 --> 01:30:22,198
I'm afraid that I'm going
to use again, d'you understand?

1288
01:30:22,238 --> 01:30:23,745
Then come with me.

1289
01:30:24,446 --> 01:30:26,975
Just come with me.
I need help. I do.

1290
01:30:28,282 --> 01:30:29,584
I'd like it if you got help.

1291
01:30:29,609 --> 01:30:33,099
I'll get help, we go straight to Jamaica,
we go to right to the local hospital.

1292
01:30:33,130 --> 01:30:34,530
I'll do it.

1293
01:30:34,847 --> 01:30:37,352
For you, I'll do anyting.
Anything you want.

1294
01:30:41,281 --> 01:30:42,872
I don't want to use again.

1295
01:30:44,385 --> 01:30:47,592
I can't. I... won’t
make it back, Whip.

1296
01:30:49,434 --> 01:30:50,963
I won't force you to stay.

1297
01:30:51,239 --> 01:30:53,752
If you don't like it,
if I'm not sober or whatever,

1298
01:30:53,857 --> 01:30:56,907
then you leave,
I promise you you can leave.

1299
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:04,838
We can leave before noon.
I’m a great pilot.

1300
01:31:05,096 --> 01:31:08,099
So many beautiful things you get to see.

1301
01:31:09,617 --> 01:31:12,754
I just want you to come with me.

1302
01:32:12,643 --> 01:32:14,756
Everything okay, sweetie?

1303
01:32:57,697 --> 01:33:00,030
<i>You’ve reached the Whitaker
Crop Dusting Company.</i>

1304
01:33:00,046 --> 01:33:02,599
<i>Please leave a message
and it will be returned.</i>

1305
01:33:03,835 --> 01:33:05,436
<i>Hey Whip, if you're there, pick up.</i>

1306
01:33:05,437 --> 01:33:07,265
<i>It's Charlie, I've got some good news.</i>

1307
01:33:40,486 --> 01:33:42,710
Aah, there's our man!

1308
01:33:42,873 --> 01:33:43,843
Hey!

1309
01:33:45,507 --> 01:33:47,327
Captain Whitaker.

1310
01:33:47,815 --> 01:33:50,281
Let me be the first
to say congratulations.

1311
01:33:50,351 --> 01:33:52,122
It's a good day. We've won.

1312
01:33:52,586 --> 01:33:54,855
Yeah, this is what we call
in my profession a "walk-over".

1313
01:33:55,359 --> 01:33:57,395
Yeah, they sheduled the
hearing, it's ten days away,

1314
01:33:57,425 --> 01:33:59,274
I can be tough, but
you just got to be sharp,

1315
01:33:59,286 --> 01:34:01,563
stay focused, answer
the questions correctly.

1316
01:34:01,579 --> 01:34:03,139
That's right, then we're good.

1317
01:34:03,153 --> 01:34:05,386
Right, I successfully
had an “Act of God”

1318
01:34:05,387 --> 01:34:07,779
added to the NTSB's list
of probable causes,

1319
01:34:07,803 --> 01:34:09,550
we've shifted suspicion away from you.

1320
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:13,075
It's no longer a question of your
condition, but the condition of the plane.

1321
01:34:13,680 --> 01:34:16,005
That's what I've been
trying to tell everybody.

1322
01:34:16,604 --> 01:34:17,770
Broken plane.

1323
01:34:17,958 --> 01:34:19,481
That's right.

1324
01:34:19,731 --> 01:34:22,626
About the... the toxocologiy report?

1325
01:34:22,627 --> 01:34:24,454
Oh, I killed that.

1326
01:34:25,422 --> 01:34:28,409
There is no physical proof that
you were intoxicated on that plane,

1327
01:34:28,417 --> 01:34:29,727
and no eyewitnesses.

1328
01:34:29,798 --> 01:34:32,610
Why we're here?
We're good!?

1329
01:34:33,157 --> 01:34:36,197
Uh... Because there is a...
a small problem.

1330
01:34:36,221 --> 01:34:38,936
Because of the turbulence,
there was no drink service on the flight.

1331
01:34:39,549 --> 01:34:43,598
But they did find two empty
vodka bottles in the galley trash.

1332
01:34:43,927 --> 01:34:45,327
And... uh...

1333
01:34:45,764 --> 01:34:48,115
And there's no physical
evidence on the bottles,

1334
01:34:48,122 --> 01:34:50,951
no DNA, no fingerprints to link
them to anyone, but

1335
01:34:50,964 --> 01:34:52,633
they were uncapped and empty.

1336
01:34:52,844 --> 01:34:55,927
And the only people who would
have had access to those bottles

1337
01:34:56,152 --> 01:34:57,626
would be the flight crew.

1338
01:34:57,869 --> 01:35:01,554
Now Margaret Evans and Camelia Satou,

1339
01:35:01,860 --> 01:35:05,802
they all had clean tox reports.
So that only leaves you,

1340
01:35:05,912 --> 01:35:07,224
– and, uh...
– Trina Marquez.

1341
01:35:07,257 --> 01:35:09,214
Right, Trina Marquez.

1342
01:35:11,169 --> 01:35:12,289
Okay.

1343
01:35:13,796 --> 01:35:16,434
Okay, I see where we're going here.

1344
01:35:17,314 --> 01:35:20,343
That's funny tough, you know,
that they only found two bottles.

1345
01:35:20,511 --> 01:35:21,257
– Why's that?

1346
01:35:21,258 --> 01:35:22,544
– Why's that?
– I drank three.

1347
01:35:24,135 --> 01:35:25,952
One's missing.

1348
01:35:27,846 --> 01:35:30,250
You know, when I first met you,

1349
01:35:30,391 --> 01:35:33,796
I couldn't believe what a drunk
arrogant scumbag you were.

1350
01:35:33,806 --> 01:35:34,694
– Oh really?
– Yeah.

1351
01:35:34,710 --> 01:35:35,496
Oh, thank you, you-

1352
01:35:35,504 --> 01:35:37,576
But I did the research, Captain Whitaker.

1353
01:35:37,590 --> 01:35:39,462
I heard the expert analyzes

1354
01:35:39,478 --> 01:35:41,533
and I got to tell you,
I’m in awe of what you did.

1355
01:35:42,455 --> 01:35:46,882
The FAA and the NTSB took ten pilots,
placed them in simulators,

1356
01:35:46,889 --> 01:35:50,269
recreated the events that led to
this plane falling out of the sky.

1357
01:35:50,555 --> 01:35:53,498
Do you know how many of them
were able to safely land the planes?

1358
01:35:53,913 --> 01:35:54,819
Not one.

1359
01:35:55,225 --> 01:35:57,303
Every pilot crashed the aircraft.

1360
01:35:57,517 --> 01:35:58,929
Killed everybody on board.

1361
01:35:59,014 --> 01:36:00,451
You're the only one who could do it.

1362
01:36:00,890 --> 01:36:01,676
Great.

1363
01:36:03,265 --> 01:36:04,211
I'm going home.

1364
01:36:04,212 --> 01:36:04,950
I'm going home.
– Hey.

1365
01:36:05,051 --> 01:36:06,751
Captain Whitaker, I'm telling you right now,
– Whip, Whip, you can't...

1366
01:36:06,753 --> 01:36:08,525
– you walk away, you're going to prison.
– Listen man.

1367
01:36:08,593 --> 01:36:10,122
I'm trying to save your fucking life.

1368
01:36:10,137 --> 01:36:11,450
What fucking life?

1369
01:36:11,998 --> 01:36:14,480
Uh? Don’t kill yourself
on my account, Hugh!

1370
01:36:14,587 --> 01:36:18,498
Captain Whitaker, this NTSB hearing
is a federal agency hearing.

1371
01:36:18,514 --> 01:36:19,024
Do you understand that?

1372
01:36:19,025 --> 01:36:20,170
Do you understand that?
– Yes, I understand that.

1373
01:36:20,191 --> 01:36:22,868
Okay, well we can't play
around with these people.

1374
01:36:23,187 --> 01:36:25,848
Now we walk in there
like this, with this...

1375
01:36:26,169 --> 01:36:27,448
we're done.

1376
01:36:27,522 --> 01:36:29,879
Everything we've done
goes right out the window.

1377
01:36:30,770 --> 01:36:34,611
I have no more moves, alright?
It's all on you right now.

1378
01:36:38,224 --> 01:36:40,973
Ok, Charlie, just get him
to the church on time.

1379
01:36:41,223 --> 01:36:43,298
Get him to the church on time.

1380
01:36:43,301 --> 01:36:48,089
Yeah Charlie, just keep him nice and
sober, so he can save your fucking union.

1381
01:36:48,228 --> 01:36:52,475
Uh? And that fucking airline.
Fuck you Charlie, fuck you.

1382
01:37:54,894 --> 01:37:56,152
It's him.

1383
01:37:56,558 --> 01:37:58,378
Yeah. I's him already.

1384
01:38:05,309 --> 01:38:06,709
How're you doin'?

1385
01:38:07,540 --> 01:38:08,871
What are you doing here?

1386
01:38:10,311 --> 01:38:12,683
It's good to see you too, Deana.
May I come in?

1387
01:38:14,934 --> 01:38:17,034
I just thought I'd come by and...

1388
01:38:17,598 --> 01:38:19,713
see how you and Will were doing.
Will?

1389
01:38:19,862 --> 01:38:21,088
Knuckles?

1390
01:38:22,013 --> 01:38:24,417
I'd like-you know, we
haven’t talked in a while,

1391
01:38:24,420 --> 01:38:27,791
so with this whole thing happenin' I just
thought I'd come by and we'd... talk.

1392
01:38:29,051 --> 01:38:31,329
You know that I prefer
that you call us.

1393
01:38:31,430 --> 01:38:33,873
Right, right, to call you, but I mean...

1394
01:38:35,244 --> 01:38:38,155
Not like anybody around here calls me...

1395
01:38:38,244 --> 01:38:41,107
the last three years only
to ask for some money.

1396
01:38:42,179 --> 01:38:43,770
Have you been drinking?

1397
01:38:44,090 --> 01:38:45,590
Well, that didn't take long, did it?

1398
01:38:45,637 --> 01:38:49,435
Hey... 17 seconds...
Yeah, exactly 17 seconds.

1399
01:38:49,593 --> 01:38:51,559
– Ladies and gentlemen, it took exactly
– Fucking hell, could you just leave!

1400
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:55,411
17 seconds before my ex-wife Deana
Coleman asked me if I was drinking,

1401
01:38:55,412 --> 01:38:56,612
what the hell.
– Just leave!

1402
01:38:56,613 --> 01:38:59,125
A world record. Leave the house
that I pay for.

1403
01:38:59,138 --> 01:39:01,039
Is that you want me to do?
– Oh. I'll call the police.

1404
01:39:01,063 --> 01:39:02,000
Call the police.

1405
01:39:02,403 --> 01:39:03,408
– I'm telling you-
– Will!

1406
01:39:03,424 --> 01:39:05,353
Whitaker Jr! How're you doing, son?

1407
01:39:05,596 --> 01:39:08,462
Man of the house.
Thanks for calling me back.

1408
01:39:08,463 --> 01:39:10,710
I'm telling you to leave.

1409
01:39:11,766 --> 01:39:13,166
Are you?

1410
01:39:13,641 --> 01:39:15,005
You're the man of the house now.

1411
01:39:15,035 --> 01:39:17,179
You upset my mother.
You gotta go.

1412
01:39:17,669 --> 01:39:19,271
Well, I’m your father, tough guy.

1413
01:39:19,365 --> 01:39:20,216
You're a drunk.

1414
01:39:21,877 --> 01:39:24,438
I'm a drunk?
You don't know who the fuck I am.

1415
01:39:24,453 --> 01:39:26,782
I sure don't!
Won't you tell me!

1416
01:39:26,783 --> 01:39:29,038
Who the fuck are you, uh?
Who are you?

1417
01:39:29,905 --> 01:39:31,621
Get the fuck out.

1418
01:39:34,312 --> 01:39:35,458
Stop it! Stop it!

1419
01:39:35,637 --> 01:39:36,872
Stop it! Stop it!

1420
01:39:36,887 --> 01:39:38,489
– I love you son.
– Get the fuck out!

1421
01:39:38,864 --> 01:39:41,728
– Get the fuck out!
– Get out now!

1422
01:39:42,701 --> 01:39:44,612
I know where I'm not wanted.

1423
01:39:45,697 --> 01:39:48,689
Captain Whitaker, a lot of people are
working to keep you out of the media,

1424
01:39:48,705 --> 01:39:49,805
are you hiding something?

1425
01:39:49,821 --> 01:39:51,884
Leave my family some room, please.

1426
01:39:51,900 --> 01:39:56,788
This is not the appropriate time.
At the appropriate time, I will, uh...

1427
01:39:57,101 --> 01:39:59,169
tell my story, and uh...

1428
01:39:59,199 --> 01:40:01,301
now is the time for grieving.

1429
01:40:02,064 --> 01:40:03,884
<i>And uh...</i>

1430
01:40:04,132 --> 01:40:06,005
<i>taking care of the injured. Thank you.</i>

1431
01:40:06,824 --> 01:40:09,624
<i>.. questions remain about the flight,
but they won't be answered today,</i>

1432
01:40:09,637 --> 01:40:13,666
<i>as Captain Whitaker politely asked
that we give his familly some peace.</i>

1433
01:40:13,707 --> 01:40:17,853
<i>A reasonable request from a quiet
heroic man, who’s been through-</i>

1434
01:40:17,868 --> 01:40:19,243
Hey Charlie.

1435
01:40:22,699 --> 01:40:25,066
Look, it's just that I just
couldn't find a safe place, uh,

1436
01:40:25,076 --> 01:40:27,128
Amanda was kind enough
to let me in, and-

1437
01:40:27,144 --> 01:40:28,066
– Yeah.
– Thank you.

1438
01:40:28,070 --> 01:40:29,513
Are you sure I can't get you something...

1439
01:40:29,528 --> 01:40:31,164
No. We're trough.

1440
01:40:31,212 --> 01:40:33,618
But thank you.
Thank you very much.

1441
01:40:35,546 --> 01:40:37,153
Now what the hell is wrong with you?

1442
01:40:37,864 --> 01:40:38,895
Really...

1443
01:40:39,547 --> 01:40:42,724
Hugh just called me, apparently
you went to your ex-wife's house,

1444
01:40:42,798 --> 01:40:45,347
drunk as a skunk, the news crew showed up,

1445
01:40:45,363 --> 01:40:47,123
and then the police escort you out!

1446
01:40:47,156 --> 01:40:49,138
It’s okay, though.
I’ve been watching, it’s okay.

1447
01:40:49,156 --> 01:40:51,544
Oh yeah, no, Hugh checked
all the media outlet that covered,

1448
01:40:51,576 --> 01:40:53,698
you come off-you come off fine,
so I guess we're good.

1449
01:40:53,700 --> 01:40:55,782
Good, ok, here's the deal. I-

1450
01:40:55,783 --> 01:40:58,158
No Whip, Whip, there's no deal.
Sorry, look at you.

1451
01:40:58,159 --> 01:41:02,010
I got no idea what you’re gonna do
or say, ever. You’re all over the place.

1452
01:41:02,026 --> 01:41:04,485
I was the one guy in your court.
The one guy.

1453
01:41:04,689 --> 01:41:07,522
I was your defender and
your apologist, but no more!

1454
01:41:07,737 --> 01:41:08,999
Charlie, I can do this.

1455
01:41:09,126 --> 01:41:11,905
You're about to be questioned
by a Federal agency about

1456
01:41:11,923 --> 01:41:16,225
piloting an airliner drunk, an airliner
that crashed, and you continue to drink!

1457
01:41:16,321 --> 01:41:18,781
And stumble around. What kind
of crazy ya have to be to do that?

1458
01:41:18,844 --> 01:41:21,162
I'm afraid of you.
– Ok alright, let me stay with you.

1459
01:41:21,407 --> 01:41:23,514
Let me stay with you, they're
staking out all my houses anyway,

1460
01:41:23,521 --> 01:41:25,315
I'll stay with you, until...

1461
01:41:25,404 --> 01:41:28,511
you know un-
until the hearing.

1462
01:41:28,852 --> 01:41:30,779
I won't leave the house.

1463
01:41:33,592 --> 01:41:35,882
I won't.

1464
01:41:37,237 --> 01:41:38,426
– You cannot drink in my house.

1465
01:41:38,427 --> 01:41:39,587
– You cannot drink in my house.
– I won't, I won't, I won't.

1466
01:41:39,598 --> 01:41:41,181
Whip, you can't have a drink.

1467
01:41:42,431 --> 01:41:43,831
I won't.

1468
01:41:50,309 --> 01:41:52,190
– Officer Edmonds.
– Yes sir.

1469
01:41:52,808 --> 01:41:54,860
Whip, this is officer Edmonds,
he'll be staying here tonight.

1470
01:41:54,947 --> 01:41:56,563
Any problems, he’ll handle it.

1471
01:42:00,534 --> 01:42:02,563
Captain Whitaker.
You...

1472
01:42:03,227 --> 01:42:05,320
you look great.
I mean that.

1473
01:42:05,659 --> 01:42:07,508
Thank you. Thank you very much.
I feel good.

1474
01:42:07,951 --> 01:42:10,144
Charlie tells you haven't
had a drink in eight days.

1475
01:42:10,333 --> 01:42:13,691
Nine days. Two hours, 26 minutes,
but who's counting?

1476
01:42:13,817 --> 01:42:16,415
Okay. Right here.

1477
01:42:17,899 --> 01:42:20,563
So yeah, we want to make this
as easy as possible...

1478
01:42:20,621 --> 01:42:22,165
on you, I hope this is okay.

1479
01:42:22,197 --> 01:42:24,384
Maybe just relax, and get some rest,

1480
01:42:24,465 --> 01:42:26,422
order up a steak, get a movie.

1481
01:42:26,900 --> 01:42:32,183
I made a copy of the entire...
investigation, my file on you.

1482
01:42:33,275 --> 01:42:36,796
I was trying to anticipate what kinds of
questions they might ask you under oath,

1483
01:42:36,977 --> 01:42:39,951
and I wrote some
non-damaging responses, so...

1484
01:42:40,106 --> 01:42:43,767
It's all in there. You know,
it's photos, and... interviews,

1485
01:42:43,801 --> 01:42:45,471
there's some testimony in there.

1486
01:42:46,072 --> 01:42:48,862
Called Ellen Block, told her
you're here, you're all tucked in.

1487
01:42:49,936 --> 01:42:51,543
She got the knife out for me?

1488
01:42:53,825 --> 01:42:57,111
Well, look. She's not happy that
I killed the tox report, but

1489
01:42:57,163 --> 01:43:01,285
this isn't a trial. So she's very limited
in the kinds of questions she can ask you.

1490
01:43:01,353 --> 01:43:03,022
You know. You're gonna be fine.

1491
01:43:03,211 --> 01:43:07,294
Yeah. The hearing's at ten,
so uh... just downstairs, so

1492
01:43:07,304 --> 01:43:10,137
we'll figure we can meet here at nine
for breakfast in our room,

1493
01:43:10,403 --> 01:43:11,955
and, uh...

1494
01:43:12,375 --> 01:43:13,861
take it from there.

1495
01:43:14,852 --> 01:43:16,936
Alright, captain Whitaker.
See you in the morning.

1496
01:43:16,952 --> 01:43:19,762
Thank you, and thank you...
for letting me stay in your house,

1497
01:43:19,776 --> 01:43:21,486
you have a beautiful home,
beautiful family, and-

1498
01:43:21,487 --> 01:43:22,625
You did great. I'm happy.

1499
01:43:22,644 --> 01:43:23,812
I needed it. I needed it.

1500
01:43:24,289 --> 01:43:26,430
– It's alright.
– I'm happy we did it.

1501
01:43:27,494 --> 01:43:28,255
– Alright,
– Okay.

1502
01:43:28,256 --> 01:43:29,585
– see you in the morning.
– Yes.

1503
01:43:38,770 --> 01:43:40,277
Looks like fine...

1504
01:46:01,293 --> 01:46:02,413
Hello?

1505
01:46:24,056 --> 01:46:25,176
Hello?

1506
01:48:46,077 --> 01:48:47,062
– How's our man?

1507
01:48:47,063 --> 01:48:48,645
– How's our man?
– Not a peep.

1508
01:48:56,662 --> 01:48:58,841
Maybe he overslept.

1509
01:49:00,081 --> 01:49:02,430
Didn't let any girls in there
last night, did you?

1510
01:49:02,602 --> 01:49:03,722
No sir.

1511
01:49:04,121 --> 01:49:07,447
Not a soul, no one came in or
out outside of... room service.

1512
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:14,381
You have a key?

1513
01:49:15,138 --> 01:49:16,513
Hey Whip.

1514
01:49:17,294 --> 01:49:19,651
Hey buddy?
Whip!

1515
01:49:19,972 --> 01:49:21,092
Shit.

1516
01:49:24,252 --> 01:49:27,234
Where the fucking fuck is he?
Oh Jeez.

1517
01:49:27,391 --> 01:49:29,335
Where is he?
Where is he, where is he?

1518
01:49:29,362 --> 01:49:30,088
I don't know.

1519
01:49:30,098 --> 01:49:32,088
Did he fucking walk away?
Son of a bitch!

1520
01:49:32,127 --> 01:49:33,311
Hugh. Hugh.

1521
01:49:33,312 --> 01:49:34,064
Whip!

1522
01:49:35,448 --> 01:49:36,592
– Get a med.
– Yak, damnit!

1523
01:49:36,593 --> 01:49:38,414
– Oh no, is he dead?
– I don't know.

1524
01:49:38,602 --> 01:49:39,914
– Is he dead?
– I don't know!

1525
01:49:39,938 --> 01:49:41,232
Yeah, I'm dead, yeah!

1526
01:49:41,248 --> 01:49:42,982
Do you want me to get an ambulance?

1527
01:49:43,108 --> 01:49:43,988
No, no no.

1528
01:49:44,133 --> 01:49:45,020
No, no no.

1529
01:49:45,022 --> 01:49:46,230
Look, uh...

1530
01:49:46,247 --> 01:49:48,179
Let's just get the bed.

1531
01:49:48,330 --> 01:49:50,609
– Come on. Come on.
– It's alright, that's alright.

1532
01:49:51,277 --> 01:49:53,884
That's it, Charlie.
Ok, that's it, we're fucked, man.

1533
01:49:53,915 --> 01:49:56,342
Your guy is just fucked,
your guy is just fucked, Charlie!

1534
01:49:56,460 --> 01:49:58,990
Alright. You just get on the front door,
make sure nobody comes in.

1535
01:49:58,999 --> 01:50:00,067
Put that on your head, you...

1536
01:50:00,082 --> 01:50:01,202
can't go, man.
– Get there, hey!

1537
01:50:01,268 --> 01:50:02,267
What time is it?

1538
01:50:02,268 --> 01:50:03,824
– We got 45 minutes, okay?

1539
01:50:03,839 --> 01:50:05,375
Well, how much grace you think we got?

1540
01:50:05,431 --> 01:50:08,702
Grace? Ellen Block?
We're gonna get some fucking grace?

1541
01:50:08,882 --> 01:50:11,707
Well, we probably got an hour before
we really gotta get him downstairs.

1542
01:50:11,723 --> 01:50:14,499
Okay great, but let's just get a wheelchair,
and wheel his ass into the hearing.

1543
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:15,650
Call Harling Mays, man.

1544
01:50:15,666 --> 01:50:16,845
Call Harling, he's got a wheelchair?

1545
01:50:16,869 --> 01:50:19,205
He got cocaine, isn' it?

1546
01:50:19,471 --> 01:50:20,724
Cocaine?

1547
01:50:25,907 --> 01:50:26,813
Hey bro.

1548
01:50:27,658 --> 01:50:30,437
Harling Mays. I'm on the list.

1549
01:50:30,609 --> 01:50:31,729
Well.

1550
01:50:33,256 --> 01:50:35,012
What's the deal, buddy?

1551
01:50:35,138 --> 01:50:37,542
You look like you're hurt, for certain.

1552
01:50:37,544 --> 01:50:40,144
– Thanks for com-
– Do not touch the merch, motherfucker!

1553
01:50:44,312 --> 01:50:46,149
Take one step back, please.

1554
01:50:48,368 --> 01:50:52,069
C-Lo, I need you outside guarding
the door please, thank you very much.

1555
01:50:54,429 --> 01:50:55,934
– It's alright.
– Yeah.

1556
01:50:56,495 --> 01:50:57,588
Alright gentlemen.

1557
01:50:57,596 --> 01:51:01,167
I need that table cleared, placed in
front of Whip, with the chair behind it.

1558
01:51:01,835 --> 01:51:03,285
Now please!

1559
01:51:05,772 --> 01:51:10,871
I need a glass of water, I need a credit
card, I need a hundred dollar bill.

1560
01:51:11,165 --> 01:51:12,406
– I got a 20.

1561
01:51:12,407 --> 01:51:13,687
– I got a 20.
– She'll do.

1562
01:51:15,353 --> 01:51:17,295
Whip, being unable to come!?

1563
01:51:17,366 --> 01:51:19,293
And I need a coco puff.

1564
01:51:20,004 --> 01:51:21,048
A what?

1565
01:51:22,048 --> 01:51:26,374
Just take the tinyest little bit of tobacco
out of the top of a cigarette, please.

1566
01:51:26,601 --> 01:51:28,842
Damn. Amateur, man.

1567
01:51:30,057 --> 01:51:32,468
We're almost home, okay baby.

1568
01:51:33,061 --> 01:51:34,754
We're gonna do....

1569
01:51:35,551 --> 01:51:37,371
two small whiffs first...

1570
01:51:39,604 --> 01:51:41,969
One on each side.

1571
01:51:42,121 --> 01:51:45,281
Just a little primer, to get it started.

1572
01:51:47,099 --> 01:51:49,058
"Coco Puff".

1573
01:52:00,167 --> 01:52:01,800
Good boy, atta boy, head back.

1574
01:52:01,941 --> 01:52:04,470
Swallow. Water.
Water, now! Chief, you.

1575
01:52:18,117 --> 01:52:20,278
Little coco puff, buddy.

1576
01:52:21,573 --> 01:52:23,164
Who's the banana man?

1577
01:52:23,360 --> 01:52:25,555
– You.
– Who's the banana man, alright.

1578
01:52:25,767 --> 01:52:27,514
Now focus up, big dog.

1579
01:52:33,444 --> 01:52:34,660
– There's a train coming to you.

1580
01:52:34,661 --> 01:52:36,661
– There's a train coming to you.
– Yeah.

1581
01:52:36,967 --> 01:52:38,683
Keep it down, big dog.

1582
01:52:39,959 --> 01:52:42,066
Banana boat's coming.
Where's banana boat?

1583
01:52:42,152 --> 01:52:43,461
– Banana boat is here.

1584
01:52:43,462 --> 01:52:44,876
– Banana boat is here.
– Alright.

1585
01:52:48,588 --> 01:52:50,484
Nothing keeps you down dog.

1586
01:52:51,373 --> 01:52:53,546
Nothing keeps that big dog down.

1587
01:52:56,718 --> 01:52:58,083
Guy, you're up.

1588
01:53:00,032 --> 01:53:00,742
– Oh, uh-

1589
01:53:00,743 --> 01:53:02,004
– Oh, uh-
– I don't, uhm...

1590
01:53:02,762 --> 01:53:03,874
That won't do any help, thank you.

1591
01:53:03,875 --> 01:53:05,908
That won't do any help, thank you.
– Shit, I'm taking that with you.

1592
01:53:14,712 --> 01:53:15,977
Thank you, brother.

1593
01:53:16,430 --> 01:53:18,349
– Shit, I'm back.
– Aha baby.

1594
01:53:18,798 --> 01:53:20,318
– I love you.
– I love you.

1595
01:53:27,621 --> 01:53:31,251
Alright. Which of one you gentlemen
is flowing in this enterprise?

1596
01:53:31,911 --> 01:53:32,979
Alright.

1597
01:53:33,019 --> 01:53:36,111
It's 500 bucks, I got...
you know, I got like 80 bucks on me.

1598
01:53:36,995 --> 01:53:38,172
I just need...

1599
01:53:38,267 --> 01:53:40,367
How much you got?
– I got it, I got it.

1600
01:53:40,470 --> 01:53:42,030
Alright.
– Here.

1601
01:53:42,053 --> 01:53:43,155
– Just...
– What the...

1602
01:53:43,179 --> 01:53:45,149
– You pay him.
– Pay him?

1603
01:53:45,172 --> 01:53:47,388
Thank you.
Okay.

1604
01:53:48,226 --> 01:53:49,965
There's a gram in here.

1605
01:53:50,188 --> 01:53:53,740
You take it, you've paid for it,
he's gonna need it later.

1606
01:53:55,168 --> 01:53:57,267
My work here is finished.

1607
01:54:00,222 --> 01:54:02,682
See you all on the dark side of the moon.

1608
01:54:02,813 --> 01:54:04,771
♪<i>Feeling alright...</i>

1609
01:54:07,129 --> 01:54:09,357
♪<i>I'm not feeling that good myself...</i>

1610
01:54:13,285 --> 01:54:15,064
♪<i>Feeling alright...</i>

1611
01:54:18,134 --> 01:54:20,514
♪<i>I'm not feeling that good myself...</i>

1612
01:54:53,323 --> 01:54:54,883
I'll go ahead and tell ‘em we're here.

1613
01:54:55,164 --> 01:54:56,063
You’re gonna make it.

1614
01:54:56,211 --> 01:54:58,023
Remember, if they ask about your drinking,

1615
01:54:58,031 --> 01:55:00,282
it’s totally acceptable
to say, “I don’t recall.”

1616
01:55:00,301 --> 01:55:03,392
Hey, don't tell me how
to lie about my drinking, okay?

1617
01:55:03,951 --> 01:55:07,599
I’m gonna lie about my drinking, I've been
lying about my drinking my whole life.

1618
01:55:25,072 --> 01:55:26,913
Those are difficult images to watch.

1619
01:55:26,996 --> 01:55:30,140
For the record, I'm Ellen Block,
Hearing Officer for this hearing.

1620
01:55:30,280 --> 01:55:31,934
Captain Whitaker, good morning.

1621
01:55:32,090 --> 01:55:33,832
Morning.
Morning.

1622
01:55:34,048 --> 01:55:38,668
What that video captures is that the
aircraft was in a relatively stable glide

1623
01:55:38,683 --> 01:55:40,683
just prior to the moment of impact.

1624
01:55:41,025 --> 01:55:45,354
However, according to the data we retreived
from the cockpit flight data recorders,

1625
01:55:45,507 --> 01:55:50,051
at exactly 9:34, after flying
27 minutes without incident,

1626
01:55:50,157 --> 01:55:56,342
the transponder recorded a loss in
altitude in excess of 4800 feet per minute

1627
01:55:56,405 --> 01:56:00,113
in what is considered a
“full pitch nose down” attitude.

1628
01:56:00,359 --> 01:56:04,724
Then, at 9:42, according
to the data recorders,

1629
01:56:04,849 --> 01:56:08,206
a decision was made to
invert the aircraft.

1630
01:56:08,327 --> 01:56:12,798
The NTSB has created animated simulation
that I would like to play at this point.

1631
01:56:14,030 --> 01:56:15,087
<i>- We gonna roll it, okay?</i>

1632
01:56:15,088 --> 01:56:16,254
<i>- We gonna roll it, okay?
– What do you mean, roll it?</i>

1633
01:56:16,277 --> 01:56:18,340
<i>We gotta do something to stop this dive.</i>

1634
01:56:18,383 --> 01:56:20,239
<i>Margaret. What's your son's name?</i>

1635
01:56:20,302 --> 01:56:21,348
<i>Trevor.</i>

1636
01:56:21,373 --> 01:56:22,277
<i>- Say "I love you, Trevor".</i>

1637
01:56:22,278 --> 01:56:22,878
<i>- Say "I love you, Trevor".
– What?</i>

1638
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:23,869
<i>- Black box. Say "I love you Trevor".</i>

1639
01:56:23,870 --> 01:56:24,778
<i>- Black box. Say "I love you Trevor".
– "I love you Trevor".</i>

1640
01:56:24,831 --> 01:56:26,944
<i>You be a good boy.
Mommy loves you.</i>

1641
01:56:26,968 --> 01:56:29,716
<i>Okay, here we go. I've got control.</i>

1642
01:56:29,747 --> 01:56:32,747
<i>Oh good Lord.
Jesus!</i>

1643
01:56:33,726 --> 01:56:35,051
<i>- Flaps out.
– Flaps out!</i>

1644
01:56:35,232 --> 01:56:37,122
<i>- Speed brakes.
– Speed brakes!</i>

1645
01:56:37,976 --> 01:56:39,856
<i>Margaret.
Power!</i>

1646
01:56:40,128 --> 01:56:41,664
<i>- Gear up.
– Gear up!</i>

1647
01:56:41,805 --> 01:56:43,766
<i>Oh, Lord Jesus, we're inverted!</i>

1648
01:56:43,810 --> 01:56:46,507
<i>Good flying lesson... We’re leve...
...maintain alt... like this.</i>

1649
01:56:46,558 --> 01:56:51,469
<i>Atlan... 2-2-7... we are inverted,
I... we are... verted.</i>

1650
01:56:51,601 --> 01:56:54,864
<i>Southj... 2... 7... did you say inverted?</i>

1651
01:56:56,241 --> 01:56:59,184
That audio is tragic and compelling.

1652
01:56:59,272 --> 01:57:01,388
I chose to play that part
of the cockpit recording

1653
01:57:01,389 --> 01:57:05,143
to highlight a key moment
onboard flight 2-2-7,

1654
01:57:05,144 --> 01:57:10,256
wherein you say “We’re gonna roll it,
here we go, I’ve got control.”

1655
01:57:10,468 --> 01:57:14,137
You made a very conscious
decision to invert the aircraft,

1656
01:57:14,144 --> 01:57:17,117
to roll the plane upside down.
Is that correct?

1657
01:57:19,916 --> 01:57:24,022
I'm not sure if it was
conscious, but uh...

1658
01:57:24,626 --> 01:57:26,451
it was more like instinct.

1659
01:57:27,399 --> 01:57:29,233
What led to that decision?

1660
01:57:33,762 --> 01:57:35,130
I don't recall.

1661
01:57:35,621 --> 01:57:37,525
Let me quote from an
investigative summary

1662
01:57:37,541 --> 01:57:41,900
”From 9:34 until 9:42
the events on the aircraft are”,

1663
01:57:41,914 --> 01:57:44,982
again I quote, “bold and remarkable”.

1664
01:57:45,524 --> 01:57:49,315
“By inverting the plane, Captain
Whitaker arrested the descent,

1665
01:57:49,409 --> 01:57:51,805
and allowed the aircraft to level off,

1666
01:57:51,918 --> 01:57:56,103
enabling him to glide the aircraft
away from any populated areas,

1667
01:57:56,157 --> 01:58:00,295
and allowing him to execute
a forced landing in an open field.

1668
01:58:09,903 --> 01:58:12,291
I heard a loud metallic bang.

1669
01:58:13,182 --> 01:58:14,994
We pitched nose down.

1670
01:58:16,877 --> 01:58:17,812
No control.

1671
01:58:17,875 --> 01:58:21,351
Yeah. First Officer Evans
testimony confirms the same.

1672
01:58:24,393 --> 01:58:25,711
I want to show you something.

1673
01:58:30,506 --> 01:58:32,347
Nothing's happening, uh...

1674
01:58:33,144 --> 01:58:36,611
Its remote control isn't working,
apologies, I can do this manually.

1675
01:58:47,976 --> 01:58:51,419
This is the jackscrew on the
tail assembly that articulates

1676
01:58:51,431 --> 01:58:55,264
the horizontal stabilizer...
also known as the elevator.

1677
01:58:55,636 --> 01:59:00,072
As you can see, the threads on
this screw are almost entirely gone.

1678
01:59:00,645 --> 01:59:06,510
This part was suggested as a maintenance
replacement in January of 2011.

1679
01:59:06,578 --> 01:59:08,138
It was never replaced.

1680
01:59:08,365 --> 01:59:12,440
It had an additional 1200 hours
of flight on it. It finally failed.

1681
01:59:12,813 --> 01:59:17,647
Our investigators have concluded
that the jackscrew snapped

1682
01:59:17,734 --> 01:59:21,474
and the elevator was frozen
in a fixed position,

1683
01:59:21,832 --> 01:59:26,720
locking the elevator in a down position
which forced the plane into a dive.

1684
01:59:26,987 --> 01:59:30,859
The loss of the elevator was,
and I quote our report,

1685
01:59:30,899 --> 01:59:34,576
“a catastrophic event, from
which recovery was improbable

1686
01:59:34,592 --> 01:59:37,029
and stable flight, impossible.”

1687
01:59:40,685 --> 01:59:41,805
Mr. Whitaker...

1688
01:59:42,777 --> 01:59:47,454
I want to talk about the days leading
and the hours leading up to the accident.

1689
01:59:47,645 --> 01:59:50,572
But before I do, I want to
remind you that you are under oath,

1690
01:59:50,581 --> 01:59:54,080
and that any testimony you'll give here
today will be considered admissable

1691
01:59:54,089 --> 01:59:56,813
in any subsequent hearings
or criminal proceedings.

1692
01:59:56,968 --> 01:59:59,133
Do you understand what that means?

1693
02:00:01,174 --> 02:00:04,687
Captain Whitaker, for the record
I need you to verbalize your answer.

1694
02:00:05,704 --> 02:00:08,131
Uh, I'm sorry.
Yes, I understand.

1695
02:00:08,925 --> 02:00:12,704
On the three days leading up
to the accident: Tuesday, October 11th,

1696
02:00:12,721 --> 02:00:16,250
Wednesday, October 12th
or Thursday, October 13th,

1697
02:00:16,260 --> 02:00:20,510
did you consume any alcohol
or other intoxicating elements?

1698
02:00:21,571 --> 02:00:22,935
No, I did not.

1699
02:00:23,255 --> 02:00:27,112
On the morning of the accident,
Friday, October 14th,

1700
02:00:27,261 --> 02:00:32,520
did you consume any alcohol,
or ingest any chemicals or drugs

1701
02:00:32,521 --> 02:00:36,083
that may have impaired your
ability to perform your job?

1702
02:00:36,716 --> 02:00:38,186
No, I did not.

1703
02:00:39,263 --> 02:00:43,433
Mr. Whitaker, do you now or
have you ever had a problem

1704
02:00:43,435 --> 02:00:47,642
with alcohol dependency,
alcoholism or drug addiction?

1705
02:00:47,809 --> 02:00:48,979
No.

1706
02:00:51,303 --> 02:00:53,816
Okay, Mr. Whitaker, we’re about done.

1707
02:01:00,645 --> 02:01:05,343
Due to the severe turbulence in the
early part of the flight, you asked

1708
02:01:05,344 --> 02:01:08,883
the flight crew to suspend the beverage
service on the plane, is that correct?

1709
02:01:09,132 --> 02:01:12,696
Yes, That's correct, I suspended
the drink service on the plane.

1710
02:01:12,745 --> 02:01:17,492
Are you aware that our investigators
found two single-service vodka bottles

1711
02:01:17,493 --> 02:01:18,941
in the galley trash bin?

1712
02:01:21,455 --> 02:01:23,382
Yeah, I'm aware of that.

1713
02:01:24,029 --> 02:01:26,440
There were five crew members on board

1714
02:01:26,448 --> 02:01:29,081
that who would have had access
to the beverage trolley.

1715
02:01:29,415 --> 02:01:31,386
Less than an hour after the accident,

1716
02:01:31,394 --> 02:01:34,475
blood was taken from each
of these crew members, yourself,

1717
02:01:34,971 --> 02:01:39,578
first officer Evans, flight
attendant Margaret Thomason...

1718
02:01:39,975 --> 02:01:45,371
and posthumously from Camelia
Satou, and Katerina Marquez.

1719
02:01:46,514 --> 02:01:49,732
A toxicology analysis was performed and...

1720
02:01:50,420 --> 02:01:52,517
three of these tests came back negative,

1721
02:01:52,518 --> 02:01:56,585
one was disqualified for
technical reasons, and one...

1722
02:01:57,089 --> 02:02:02,118
tested positive for alcohol.
It registered a .17 blood alcohol level.

1723
02:02:02,119 --> 02:02:03,616
Are you aware of that?

1724
02:02:04,636 --> 02:02:06,526
Yeah. I'm aware of it now.

1725
02:02:13,276 --> 02:02:17,367
Miss Marquez was not only a colleague,
but you knew her outside of work,

1726
02:02:17,375 --> 02:02:19,449
is that correct?

1727
02:02:20,452 --> 02:02:22,132
Outside of work...

1728
02:02:23,054 --> 02:02:24,335
No, not really.

1729
02:02:24,447 --> 02:02:27,113
Did you know Miss Marquez
had a drinking problem?

1730
02:02:28,216 --> 02:02:29,429
No, I did not.

1731
02:02:29,538 --> 02:02:31,863
Did you ever see her drink to excess?

1732
02:02:34,382 --> 02:02:35,848
No, I did not.

1733
02:02:35,898 --> 02:02:38,802
Were you aware that she was
twice treated for alcohol addiction,

1734
02:02:38,806 --> 02:02:42,835
the last time was 16 months ago
and paid for by SouthJet Airlines?

1735
02:02:44,291 --> 02:02:45,691
No, I did not.

1736
02:02:56,058 --> 02:03:02,618
Is it your opinion... that Katerina
Marquez... drank on that flight?

1737
02:03:14,229 --> 02:03:16,024
Could you repeat the question?

1738
02:03:16,778 --> 02:03:21,338
Is it your opinion that Katerina
Marquez drank on that flight?

1739
02:03:33,431 --> 02:03:34,714
I’m sorry. My what?

1740
02:03:34,847 --> 02:03:35,967
Your opinion, Captain.

1741
02:03:36,198 --> 02:03:39,430
Since her toxicology report
is the only toxicology report

1742
02:03:39,442 --> 02:03:43,968
that is admissable in this hearing, and
she in fact tested positive for alcohol,

1743
02:03:43,969 --> 02:03:47,873
is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez

1744
02:03:47,894 --> 02:03:51,598
drank those 2 bottles
of vodka on the plane?

1745
02:04:03,149 --> 02:04:06,365
I’m sorry Mr. Whitaker, I couldn’t
hear you. What did you say?

1746
02:04:09,177 --> 02:04:11,143
I said, "God, help me."

1747
02:04:11,914 --> 02:04:14,763
Yes, well. However, is it your opinion-

1748
02:04:14,774 --> 02:04:16,208
It's my opinion...

1749
02:04:16,467 --> 02:04:18,287
Trina did not...

1750
02:04:18,638 --> 02:04:20,190
drink that Vodka.

1751
02:04:20,859 --> 02:04:22,112
Excuse me, Mr. Whitaker?

1752
02:04:22,128 --> 02:04:23,698
She saved the boy’s life, that's-

1753
02:04:23,699 --> 02:04:25,412
Could you speak louder, Captain Whitaker?

1754
02:04:25,420 --> 02:04:27,961
Trina Marquez did not drink the vodka.

1755
02:04:29,546 --> 02:04:31,653
Because I drank the vodka.

1756
02:04:34,632 --> 02:04:35,809
Objection!

1757
02:04:36,721 --> 02:04:38,637
Please be seated sir. This-

1758
02:04:39,567 --> 02:04:40,687
Sir.

1759
02:04:40,838 --> 02:04:41,715
– I drank the vodka bottles-

1760
02:04:41,716 --> 02:04:43,312
– I drank the vodka bottles-
– Did you hear what I said, I object!

1761
02:04:43,320 --> 02:04:45,843
Please be seated sir,
this is not a court room.

1762
02:04:45,913 --> 02:04:47,363
Well, I object anyway!

1763
02:04:48,849 --> 02:04:51,128
I drank the vodka bottles on the plane.

1764
02:04:53,029 --> 02:04:57,676
Captain Whitaker. On the three nights
before the accident, October 11-

1765
02:04:57,687 --> 02:05:02,778
October 11, October 12 and 13th
and 14th, I was intoxicated.

1766
02:05:02,789 --> 02:05:05,771
I drank all of those days, I drank...

1767
02:05:06,381 --> 02:05:07,781
in excess.

1768
02:05:09,211 --> 02:05:12,083
– On the morning of the accident-
– I was drunk.

1769
02:05:20,145 --> 02:05:21,596
I'm drunk now.

1770
02:05:28,131 --> 02:05:29,856
I'm drunk right now...

1771
02:05:30,490 --> 02:05:32,013
Miss Block...

1772
02:05:38,920 --> 02:05:40,605
because I'm alcoholic.

1773
02:06:06,490 --> 02:06:07,924
That was it.

1774
02:06:11,560 --> 02:06:13,042
I was finished.

1775
02:06:15,002 --> 02:06:16,437
I was done.

1776
02:06:19,429 --> 02:06:25,169
It was as if I had reached
my life long limit... for lies.

1777
02:06:26,452 --> 02:06:29,458
I could not tell one more lie.

1778
02:06:32,984 --> 02:06:34,708
And maybe I'm a sucker.

1779
02:06:36,795 --> 02:06:39,245
Because if I had told just one more lie,

1780
02:06:39,735 --> 02:06:42,300
I could have walked away
from all that mess...

1781
02:06:43,009 --> 02:06:46,588
kept my wings, kept my
false sense of pride...

1782
02:06:49,232 --> 02:06:54,120
and most importantly, I could have avoided
being locked up in here with all of you,

1783
02:06:54,842 --> 02:06:57,714
nice folks for the last 13 months.

1784
02:07:01,329 --> 02:07:02,834
But I'm here.

1785
02:07:03,824 --> 02:07:05,824
And I'll be here for at least the...

1786
02:07:06,504 --> 02:07:09,056
next four or five years.
And that's fair.

1787
02:07:12,937 --> 02:07:15,841
I betrayed the public trust. I did.

1788
02:07:16,031 --> 02:07:20,215
That’s what the judge explained to me.
I had betrayed the public trust.

1789
02:07:22,003 --> 02:07:25,142
The FAA, they took away
my pilot's license.

1790
02:07:27,112 --> 02:07:28,399
And that's fair.

1791
02:07:29,372 --> 02:07:32,963
My chances of ever flying
again are slim to none.

1792
02:07:35,002 --> 02:07:36,648
And I accept that.

1793
02:07:39,473 --> 02:07:42,541
I got a lot of time to think
about it, the all of it.

1794
02:07:45,202 --> 02:07:46,418
Doing some writing.

1795
02:07:48,387 --> 02:07:52,420
I wrote letters to each of the
families that had lost loved ones.

1796
02:07:55,662 --> 02:07:57,683
Some of ‘em were able
to hear my apology...

1797
02:07:59,881 --> 02:08:01,331
some of ‘em never will.

1798
02:08:03,165 --> 02:08:05,694
I also apologized to...

1799
02:08:06,905 --> 02:08:11,434
all the people that tried to help me...
along the way, but I...

1800
02:08:13,113 --> 02:08:15,767
couldn't or wouldn't listen.

1801
02:08:19,075 --> 02:08:20,963
People like my wife...

1802
02:08:24,700 --> 02:08:26,361
My ex-wife...

1803
02:08:30,751 --> 02:08:32,241
My son.

1804
02:08:35,536 --> 02:08:38,644
And again like I said, you know,
some of them will...

1805
02:08:41,057 --> 02:08:43,586
never forgive me, some of them won't...

1806
02:08:46,025 --> 02:08:47,905
But at least I'm sober.

1807
02:08:50,523 --> 02:08:53,779
I thank God for that,
I’m grateful for that.

1808
02:08:56,606 --> 02:08:58,510
And this is gonna sound really stupid

1809
02:08:58,511 --> 02:09:01,142
coming from a man who’s
locked up in prison...

1810
02:09:03,554 --> 02:09:05,692
but for the first time in my life...

1811
02:09:07,202 --> 02:09:08,755
I’m free.

1812
02:09:22,294 --> 02:09:25,081
Whitaker.
You got a visitor.

1813
02:10:02,555 --> 02:10:04,886
– You have 40 minutes.
– Okay.

1814
02:10:15,358 --> 02:10:17,157
Look at you, boy.

1815
02:10:17,759 --> 02:10:18,965
How you doing?

1816
02:10:19,288 --> 02:10:20,840
– Good.
– You look good.

1817
02:10:22,146 --> 02:10:23,972
Com'on, sit down.

1818
02:10:25,642 --> 02:10:28,598
This is a surprise.
Did you get that gift I sent you?

1819
02:10:28,608 --> 02:10:29,269
– Yeah.
– Yeah?

1820
02:10:29,285 --> 02:10:30,558
– Yeah, I got it.
– You like it?

1821
02:10:30,559 --> 02:10:31,679
– Yeah.
– Good...

1822
02:10:34,128 --> 02:10:37,244
– How's your mom?
– Fine. She's alright.

1823
02:10:39,010 --> 02:10:42,875
My College counselor wanted
me to come in... interview you.

1824
02:10:43,930 --> 02:10:44,945
Me?

1825
02:10:45,131 --> 02:10:48,441
Yeah. I'm writing essays
for College applications.

1826
02:10:48,504 --> 02:10:49,624
Good.

1827
02:10:49,950 --> 02:10:51,416
I need your help.

1828
02:10:51,729 --> 02:10:53,129
So you got it.

1829
02:10:54,375 --> 02:10:59,218
And then... this essay.
The essay that I have to write...

1830
02:11:01,020 --> 02:11:07,455
it's called... “the most fascinating
person... that I’ve never met.”

1831
02:11:18,226 --> 02:11:19,904
So...

1832
02:11:24,468 --> 02:11:25,935
Who are you?

1833
02:11:35,042 --> 02:11:36,579
That's a good question.

1834
02:11:41,652 --> 02:11:46,922
