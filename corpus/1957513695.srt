2
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,040
I'm hungry.

3
00:00:38,123 --> 00:00:40,500
A lady never complains.

4
00:00:40,584 --> 00:00:42,377
We can't eat dresses.

5
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,423
If only the Duke had sent bread.

6
00:00:46,506 --> 00:00:48,258
I think he wants to marry you.

7
00:00:48,342 --> 00:00:49,968
I'd rather marry you.

8
00:00:50,052 --> 00:00:51,637
He's a Duke.

9
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,390
And you, my dear, a rapidly ageing orphan.

10
00:00:55,474 --> 00:00:57,142
Ah, Marie!

11
00:00:57,226 --> 00:00:59,978
Well, I won't be rescued.
I'm not in distress.

12
00:01:00,062 --> 00:01:02,439
We have no money. Not a bean.

13
00:01:02,522 --> 00:01:04,524
Your whole life, our
country has been at war...

14
00:01:04,608 --> 00:01:05,943
- and everyone must make...
- Everyone must make...

15
00:01:06,011 --> 00:01:07,339
- ...compromises in a war.
- ...compromises in a war.

16
00:01:07,402 --> 00:01:09,780
I don't love the Duke de Guiche.

17
00:01:09,863 --> 00:01:11,073
Wear the dress he sent.

18
00:01:11,156 --> 00:01:14,785
No. Red is vulgar, and it reeks of lechery.

19
00:01:14,868 --> 00:01:15,953
Have you seen my shoes?

20
00:01:16,036 --> 00:01:17,621
- If you don't love him...
- Or even like him.

21
00:01:17,704 --> 00:01:20,457
Why did you accept his
invitation to the theater?

22
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,503
Because we can't afford the
tickets, and I want to see the play.

23
00:01:26,713 --> 00:01:28,423
He's here.

24
00:01:29,007 --> 00:01:30,884
He's here.

25
00:01:30,968 --> 00:01:32,678
He's here. Now, don't be rude to him.

26
00:01:32,761 --> 00:01:34,012
I'm not rude.

27
00:01:34,096 --> 00:01:37,015
I am enigmatically distant
and fashionably late.

28
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:38,183
Where are my shoes?

29
00:01:38,267 --> 00:01:40,185
If you anger him, he'll ruin us.

30
00:01:40,269 --> 00:01:42,104
Marry the Duke and you'll be rich.

31
00:01:42,187 --> 00:01:44,022
A clever marriage is your only option.

32
00:01:44,106 --> 00:01:45,983
I have no intention of marrying anyone.

33
00:01:46,066 --> 00:01:48,652
Believe me, spinsterhood is bleak.

34
00:01:48,735 --> 00:01:51,196
And love, does that mean nothing to you?

35
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,701
It might smell rosy for a year
or two, but love doesn't last.

36
00:01:55,784 --> 00:02:00,080
What lasts is compromise and sacrifice.

37
00:02:00,914 --> 00:02:02,040
Children need love.

38
00:02:02,124 --> 00:02:03,458
Adults need money.

39
00:02:08,213 --> 00:02:09,214
Hello, Jacques.

40
00:02:09,298 --> 00:02:10,799
Marie. Marie.

41
00:02:10,882 --> 00:02:12,301
Tell your mistress she's two
months behind with the rent.

42
00:02:12,384 --> 00:02:13,677
It's coming, I promise.

43
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,137
Two months!

44
00:02:16,638 --> 00:02:18,223
Marie!

45
00:02:21,935 --> 00:02:23,145
It's perfectly fetching.

46
00:02:23,228 --> 00:02:25,939
I just long to see you in crimson silk.

47
00:02:26,023 --> 00:02:27,900
- I couldn't wear that dress.
- Oh?

48
00:02:27,983 --> 00:02:30,068
I don't have the shoes to match. Sorry.

49
00:02:30,152 --> 00:02:33,030
Oh, I'll rectify your errant shoelessness.

50
00:02:33,113 --> 00:02:36,325
Maybe the good Duke should've
send you the dress, Valvert.

51
00:02:36,408 --> 00:02:38,410
Oh, no, I tried it.

52
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:40,495
It was too loose on the bust.

53
00:02:41,955 --> 00:02:44,416
At least you have more
than one pair of shoes.

54
00:02:44,499 --> 00:02:47,586
<i>What does it feel like</i>

55
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:50,672
<i>To slow dance in sunlight</i>

56
00:02:50,756 --> 00:02:54,676
<i>With someone you love?</i>

57
00:02:56,261 --> 00:02:59,514
<i>Somebody who sees you</i>

58
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:02,517
<i>And won't ever leave you</i>

59
00:03:02,601 --> 00:03:08,357
<i>Alone Whatever comes</i>

60
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,193
<i>I need something to die for</i>

61
00:03:11,276 --> 00:03:14,446
<i>Write poems and cry for</i>

62
00:03:14,529 --> 00:03:18,367
<i>And I won't be ashamed</i>

63
00:03:20,535 --> 00:03:23,205
<i>I'm nobody's pet</i>

64
00:03:23,288 --> 00:03:26,833
<i>No one's wife no one's woman</i>

65
00:03:27,876 --> 00:03:30,379
<i>And I won't play that game</i>

66
00:03:30,462 --> 00:03:36,301
<i>I'd give anything for someone to say</i>

67
00:03:36,385 --> 00:03:39,846
<i>That they can't live without me</i>

68
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,182
<i>And they'll be there forever</i>

69
00:03:42,266 --> 00:03:48,313
<i>I'd give anything for
someone to say to me</i>

70
00:03:48,397 --> 00:03:52,150
<i>That no matter how bad it gets</i>

71
00:03:52,234 --> 00:03:56,405
<i>They won't turn away from me</i>

72
00:03:58,407 --> 00:04:00,867
<i>What do you do</i>

73
00:04:00,951 --> 00:04:03,996
<i>When you're always waiting</i>

74
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:07,583
<i>To find love at first sight?</i>

75
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:13,422
<i>If I'm naive</i>

76
00:04:13,505 --> 00:04:17,134
<i>Why does all the poetry</i>

77
00:04:17,968 --> 00:04:20,387
<i>Say that I might?</i>

78
00:04:22,431 --> 00:04:25,142
<i>I have heard songs that say</i>

79
00:04:25,225 --> 00:04:28,228
<i>Love conquers everything</i>

80
00:04:28,312 --> 00:04:31,398
<i>However you name it</i>

81
00:04:34,234 --> 00:04:36,987
<i>It's right there in front of you</i>

82
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:40,198
<i>Wherever you are</i>

83
00:04:40,282 --> 00:04:43,076
<i>You just have to claim it Claim it</i>

84
00:05:00,719 --> 00:05:01,803
Who's that?

85
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:02,971
The Duke de Guiche.

86
00:05:03,055 --> 00:05:04,556
Second only to the King.

87
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,724
No, the lady.

88
00:05:05,807 --> 00:05:07,809
Oh, Roxanne.

89
00:05:07,893 --> 00:05:10,103
Well above your station, my friend.

90
00:05:14,483 --> 00:05:16,860
Oh, what superb ribbons, Duke de Guiche.

91
00:05:16,944 --> 00:05:19,196
Gorgeous piping. And trim.

92
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:20,656
Doeskin and beaver, ladies.

93
00:05:20,739 --> 00:05:22,074
Doeskin and beaver.

94
00:05:25,494 --> 00:05:26,578
Yes, thank you.

95
00:05:26,662 --> 00:05:27,663
Stop there, sir.

96
00:05:30,374 --> 00:05:31,375
In you go, sir.

97
00:05:40,968 --> 00:05:42,010
...sir.

98
00:05:48,475 --> 00:05:50,602
Be swift, be crafty...

99
00:05:50,686 --> 00:05:52,854
take from the women and
the men without swords.

100
00:05:52,938 --> 00:05:53,939
And children?

101
00:05:55,357 --> 00:05:57,526
A child with a full purse is an adult.

102
00:05:57,609 --> 00:06:01,238
<i>I'd give anything for someone to say</i>

103
00:06:01,321 --> 00:06:03,156
<i>For someone to say</i>

104
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,702
<i>That they can't live without me</i>

105
00:06:06,785 --> 00:06:09,246
<i>And they'll be there forever</i>

106
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:15,085
<i>I'd give anything for
someone to say to me</i>

107
00:06:15,168 --> 00:06:18,880
<i>That no matter That no
matter how bad it gets</i>

108
00:06:18,964 --> 00:06:22,593
<i>They won't turn away from me</i>

109
00:06:24,887 --> 00:06:30,475
<i>If love's there, I'll
feel it and its stare</i>

110
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:33,896
<i>It'll be freedom at first sight</i>

111
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:37,107
<i>I'll be walking on air</i>

112
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:41,904
<i>If love's there won't dare run away</i>

113
00:06:42,738 --> 00:06:46,408
<i>I'll swallow my pride</i>

114
00:06:47,075 --> 00:06:49,369
<i>And I'll ask</i>

115
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:54,917
<i>You to stay</i>

116
00:07:14,937 --> 00:07:15,938
Thief!

117
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,191
Hey!

118
00:07:19,775 --> 00:07:21,151
Stop that boy!

119
00:07:21,235 --> 00:07:23,612
Hey! Stop him!

120
00:07:28,575 --> 00:07:29,660
Play! Play! Play!

121
00:07:29,743 --> 00:07:30,786
- Play! Play! Play!
- Play! Play!

122
00:07:30,869 --> 00:07:32,454
Play! Play! Play!

123
00:07:38,043 --> 00:07:39,336
Have you seen Cyrano?

124
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:40,837
Not yet.

125
00:07:45,676 --> 00:07:48,220
Would you like an orange? Yeah?

126
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,815
Play! Play! Play!

127
00:07:59,898 --> 00:08:00,983
Theater.

128
00:08:01,066 --> 00:08:03,527
Inhale it, my boy. Literally.

129
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,237
Can you feel it? Yes?

130
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,906
Tonight you will see the
magnificent Montfleury...

131
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,409
the greatest actor of his generation.

132
00:08:59,207 --> 00:09:00,500
Montfleury.

133
00:09:00,834 --> 00:09:01,835
Him?

134
00:09:07,132 --> 00:09:08,675
Montfleury!

135
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:10,969
Bravo! Bravo!

136
00:09:15,349 --> 00:09:21,521
Happy is he who, far from
court and Society's sway...

137
00:09:21,605 --> 00:09:24,858
in isolation self-imposed...

138
00:09:25,525 --> 00:09:27,152
shuns company.

139
00:09:27,236 --> 00:09:28,528
And who...

140
00:09:28,612 --> 00:09:32,616
when the soft wind whistles wishingly...

141
00:09:32,699 --> 00:09:35,244
Montfleury, what are you doing here?

142
00:09:35,327 --> 00:09:36,411
Cyrano?

143
00:09:36,495 --> 00:09:37,704
- Cyrano?
- Yes.

144
00:09:37,788 --> 00:09:39,706
After your performance last week...

145
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:43,252
I sent you a letter urging you to retire.

146
00:09:43,335 --> 00:09:45,504
Cyrano.

147
00:09:45,587 --> 00:09:49,091
Happy is he who, far from
court and Society's...

148
00:09:49,174 --> 00:09:51,260
Did you receive my letter?

149
00:09:51,343 --> 00:09:54,805
Yes, I received your
letter, and I burnt it.

150
00:09:54,888 --> 00:09:57,516
I am a professional actor.

151
00:09:57,599 --> 00:09:58,850
- Yes, you are!
- Bravo!

152
00:09:58,934 --> 00:10:00,644
I've received numerous prizes.

153
00:10:00,727 --> 00:10:01,895
He has.

154
00:10:01,979 --> 00:10:04,565
I have performed at court
for the King himself.

155
00:10:04,648 --> 00:10:05,649
- Indeed, you have.
- Yes!

156
00:10:05,732 --> 00:10:07,442
Yes.

157
00:10:07,526 --> 00:10:11,738
I have been successfully entertaining
the people for over three decades.

158
00:10:13,282 --> 00:10:16,743
And now I will act!

159
00:10:16,827 --> 00:10:17,995
- Act! Act! Act!
- Act! Act! Act!

160
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:19,454
Act! Act! Act!

161
00:10:19,538 --> 00:10:20,581
Act!

162
00:10:21,373 --> 00:10:23,083
Happy he who shuns...

163
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,918
Final warning!

164
00:10:25,002 --> 00:10:28,213
In insulting me, you
insult the dramatic muse.

165
00:10:28,297 --> 00:10:32,384
And worse, you... you
desecrate this theater...

166
00:10:32,467 --> 00:10:36,013
this crucible of human...

167
00:10:37,097 --> 00:10:38,390
humanity.

168
00:10:38,473 --> 00:10:39,558
Hear, hear!

169
00:10:39,641 --> 00:10:42,686
This sacred wooden O.

170
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:45,689
No, sir. Untrue.

171
00:10:45,772 --> 00:10:48,191
I'm sorry, but you lie.

172
00:10:50,569 --> 00:10:53,488
You've made this stage your personal sty!

173
00:10:53,572 --> 00:10:55,949
The dramatic muse has fled the building.

174
00:10:56,033 --> 00:10:59,328
She scampered off when you
started gilding the lily...

175
00:10:59,411 --> 00:11:02,372
with your great big voice.

176
00:11:07,753 --> 00:11:10,422
The poor muse had no choice.

177
00:11:11,506 --> 00:11:14,885
I love this place and all it means.

178
00:11:14,968 --> 00:11:17,930
Poetry, romance, terror, truth.

179
00:11:18,013 --> 00:11:21,099
I've loved it here since early youth.

180
00:11:21,183 --> 00:11:23,518
Can't stand aside while you dishonor it...

181
00:11:23,602 --> 00:11:26,188
with your pumping and your hideous jigs.

182
00:11:26,271 --> 00:11:28,148
I will not abide your thumping...

183
00:11:28,232 --> 00:11:30,984
and, er, dreadful wigs.

184
00:11:33,028 --> 00:11:34,988
Montfleury, you've abandoned the truth.

185
00:11:35,072 --> 00:11:36,448
You've lost your core.

186
00:11:36,531 --> 00:11:39,159
You don't remember how
truth feels or what it's for.

187
00:11:39,243 --> 00:11:42,162
So, now leave this stage, never to return.

188
00:11:42,246 --> 00:11:45,999
And I'll applaud the new
integrity you'll earn.

189
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,460
Exit, Montfleury.

190
00:11:53,924 --> 00:11:56,635
I'm not moving one step from
the center of this stage.

191
00:11:56,718 --> 00:11:58,554
I am necessary.

192
00:11:58,637 --> 00:12:02,724
If you will not leave by invitation,
then I am compelled to use force.

193
00:12:04,726 --> 00:12:06,019
Help! Help me, someone!

194
00:12:06,103 --> 00:12:07,187
Protect me!

195
00:12:07,271 --> 00:12:08,730
Arrest him! Help!

196
00:12:08,814 --> 00:12:10,816
Please! Help me!

197
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:13,986
- Please, Cyrano. Please.
- Will anyone here defend this great sausage?

198
00:12:17,322 --> 00:12:18,824
I will duel with any volunteer...

199
00:12:18,907 --> 00:12:21,326
with all the honor
commensurate to his station.

200
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,412
Is anyone willing to fight for Montfleury?

201
00:12:23,495 --> 00:12:25,330
You are no Samson.

202
00:12:25,414 --> 00:12:28,584
I am no Goliath either, but
I fight like the two combined.

203
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:29,835
I think not.

204
00:12:29,918 --> 00:12:32,129
Goliath was a giant.

205
00:12:32,212 --> 00:12:33,922
Care to think again?

206
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:37,426
No volunteers?

207
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:39,219
You came here to see Montfleury...

208
00:12:39,303 --> 00:12:41,096
and yet you're not
willing to fight for him?

209
00:12:42,097 --> 00:12:43,724
- Montfleury...
- Sir, please.

210
00:12:43,807 --> 00:12:47,144
I will count to three, and you
will exit stage right hurriedly.

211
00:12:47,227 --> 00:12:48,312
Please.

212
00:12:48,395 --> 00:12:50,022
- One...
- Do something.

213
00:12:50,105 --> 00:12:52,232
- Two...
- Think of the play.

214
00:12:52,316 --> 00:12:53,609
Three!

215
00:12:56,486 --> 00:12:58,488
Ladies and gentlemen, please.

216
00:13:08,165 --> 00:13:11,084
Jodelet! I came to see a play!

217
00:13:11,168 --> 00:13:12,878
We paid to see a play!

218
00:13:12,961 --> 00:13:16,048
And I have saved you from seeing a fiasco!

219
00:13:16,131 --> 00:13:18,050
I paid to see Montfleury!

220
00:13:18,133 --> 00:13:20,010
Yes, what about their money?

221
00:13:20,093 --> 00:13:21,553
Always the money.

222
00:13:21,637 --> 00:13:22,638
Here.

223
00:13:25,349 --> 00:13:29,394
Oh, at this price, sir, you can
close the theaters every night.

224
00:13:29,478 --> 00:13:32,648
Ladies and gentlemen, you will
be refunded in full at the door.

225
00:13:32,731 --> 00:13:33,899
Dinner?

226
00:13:33,982 --> 00:13:36,360
Oh, I'd love to. But no money.

227
00:13:36,443 --> 00:13:37,945
You had a full bag of coins.

228
00:13:38,028 --> 00:13:40,656
All donated to the long-suffering
patrons of this theater.

229
00:13:40,739 --> 00:13:42,741
- How will you eat?
- The gesture is more than the meal.

230
00:13:42,824 --> 00:13:44,076
You.

231
00:13:45,744 --> 00:13:47,955
You're a freak.

232
00:13:49,706 --> 00:13:52,209
The insult is antique, but I accept it.

233
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,837
Freak.

234
00:13:57,756 --> 00:13:59,091
Is that it?

235
00:13:59,174 --> 00:14:01,927
Have you exhausted your
dictionary of scorn?

236
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:04,763
Who is this savage who dares
to present himself in public...

237
00:14:04,846 --> 00:14:08,600
without ribbons, bows or braids?

238
00:14:10,102 --> 00:14:11,937
I am not au courant, it's true.

239
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:15,857
But think of my deeds as my
ribbons, my humor as a bow.

240
00:14:15,941 --> 00:14:18,694
Oh, do pipe down, or else you'll drown.

241
00:14:19,361 --> 00:14:20,696
In verbosity.

242
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:22,864
A fellow poet.

243
00:14:22,948 --> 00:14:25,534
Pleasure to meet you. Cyrano de Bergerac.

244
00:14:47,556 --> 00:14:49,808
I accept your challenge.

245
00:14:49,892 --> 00:14:52,185
I'll make short work of this.

246
00:14:54,813 --> 00:14:56,648
Isn't he a hoot?

247
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:02,988
A palpable miss.

248
00:15:03,071 --> 00:15:05,324
It's hard to hit a target quite so small.

249
00:15:05,407 --> 00:15:07,451
The man is barely four feet tall.

250
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:13,165
<i>Sir, when I was born The
nurses laughed hysterically</i>

251
00:15:13,248 --> 00:15:16,209
<i>They'd never seen anything
quite like me, apparently</i>

252
00:15:16,293 --> 00:15:19,296
<i>I'll never forget it I
can still hear them joking</i>

253
00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:22,591
<i>One said, "My goodness,
what has God been smoking?"</i>

254
00:15:22,674 --> 00:15:25,844
<i>From when I was born I
learned to control my tears</i>

255
00:15:25,928 --> 00:15:29,723
<i>When they carried me home through
town I left a trail of broken mirrors</i>

256
00:15:29,806 --> 00:15:31,850
<i>Yes, when children see me
They scream and run away</i>

257
00:15:31,934 --> 00:15:35,520
<i>You're absolutely right
Halloween's my favorite holiday</i>

258
00:15:35,604 --> 00:15:37,189
<i>I am a monster I am a mutant</i>

259
00:15:37,272 --> 00:15:38,732
<i>A freak of nature</i>

260
00:15:38,815 --> 00:15:42,236
<i>I've heard all the
hateful ugly nomenclature</i>

261
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:44,529
<i>Can't you see</i>

262
00:15:44,613 --> 00:15:47,866
<i>I'm much more than you think</i>

263
00:15:49,284 --> 00:15:52,871
<i>I've heard it all so many times</i>

264
00:15:53,497 --> 00:15:55,040
You are a disgrace!

265
00:15:55,123 --> 00:15:59,670
<i>Everybody knows I'm so
much more than a freak</i>

266
00:15:59,753 --> 00:16:03,215
<i>If you wanna try to hurt me</i>

267
00:16:03,298 --> 00:16:06,718
<i>You better get in line</i>

268
00:16:06,802 --> 00:16:08,428
<i>- You just have to say it
- Can't you see</i>

269
00:16:08,512 --> 00:16:10,347
<i>I get it, it makes sense</i>

270
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,723
<i>- He's much more than you think
- When you have your kind of talent</i>

271
00:16:11,807 --> 00:16:13,183
<i>For clever vicious comments</i>

272
00:16:13,267 --> 00:16:14,810
<i>- My heart's not even angry
- He's heard it all</i>

273
00:16:14,893 --> 00:16:16,395
<i>- It's just the way it breaks
- So many times</i>

274
00:16:16,478 --> 00:16:18,230
<i>And don't be so tough on God</i>

275
00:16:18,313 --> 00:16:20,232
<i>Everybody makes mistakes</i>

276
00:16:20,315 --> 00:16:22,067
<i>- Yes, one sight of me could make a statue cry
- Everybody knows</i>

277
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,443
<i>- He's so much more
- Guess what else</i>

278
00:16:23,527 --> 00:16:24,570
<i>- When bluebirds land on me
- Than a freak</i>

279
00:16:24,653 --> 00:16:26,071
<i>They shit themselves and die</i>

280
00:16:26,154 --> 00:16:27,447
<i>- If you wanna try
- Whichever way I look at you</i>

281
00:16:27,531 --> 00:16:29,533
<i>- To hurt him
- Can't find a tasteful side</i>

282
00:16:29,616 --> 00:16:32,443
<i>- A specimen like you belongs in formaldehyde
- You better get in line</i>

283
00:16:32,536 --> 00:16:33,912
<i>Yes, what you've heard is true</i>

284
00:16:33,996 --> 00:16:35,497
<i>I am not a rumor</i>

285
00:16:35,581 --> 00:16:39,167
<i>I'm living proof that God
has a sick sense of humor</i>

286
00:16:49,469 --> 00:16:51,805
Cyrano! Cyrano! Cyrano!

287
00:16:51,889 --> 00:16:52,931
Shh!

288
00:16:55,934 --> 00:16:56,935
Cyrano!

289
00:17:23,837 --> 00:17:26,757
Yes. It all goes in.

290
00:17:28,926 --> 00:17:30,761
And God, how it hurts.

291
00:17:44,149 --> 00:17:46,777
He went too far.

292
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:50,447
Valvert insulted him, and
then challenged him to a duel.

293
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:53,533
Valvert is a Comte, and in my retinue.

294
00:17:55,077 --> 00:17:58,664
I guarantee you Cyrano
took no pleasure from it.

295
00:17:58,747 --> 00:18:00,165
You know him?

296
00:18:00,249 --> 00:18:01,541
They're from the same town...

297
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,710
- in the south west.
- Cyrano is my oldest friend.

298
00:18:03,794 --> 00:18:07,798
It would be to your advantage
to end the friendship.

299
00:18:09,967 --> 00:18:13,512
Roxanne, I won't wait forever.

300
00:18:16,807 --> 00:18:18,642
Did I miss a proposal?

301
00:18:18,725 --> 00:18:21,186
Oh, don't push your luck, pretty thing.

302
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,813
Don't do that.

303
00:18:26,984 --> 00:18:29,194
How about a drinking song?

304
00:18:29,278 --> 00:18:30,904
Like soldiers do.

305
00:18:30,988 --> 00:18:32,197
We're better than that.

306
00:18:32,281 --> 00:18:33,448
At least, I am.

307
00:18:34,449 --> 00:18:35,826
May I ask you a question?

308
00:18:36,827 --> 00:18:37,911
Anything.

309
00:18:37,995 --> 00:18:39,204
It's a little personal.

310
00:18:40,163 --> 00:18:41,957
I have no secrets from you.

311
00:18:44,835 --> 00:18:45,961
Are you in love?

312
00:18:47,462 --> 00:18:49,131
Whatever gave you that idea?

313
00:18:49,214 --> 00:18:50,465
See, I knew you wouldn't like it.

314
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:51,633
Do I seem offended?

315
00:18:51,717 --> 00:18:53,677
No. But your guard is up.

316
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,263
It's just some things are private.

317
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,852
What gave me that idea...

318
00:19:01,935 --> 00:19:04,187
was your performance at the theater today.

319
00:19:06,189 --> 00:19:09,484
I sensed you were playing to one
particular member of the audience.

320
00:19:09,568 --> 00:19:10,777
Oh, who?

321
00:19:10,861 --> 00:19:12,779
Let's not continue this charade.

322
00:19:12,863 --> 00:19:14,323
If you want to unburden, fine.

323
00:19:14,406 --> 00:19:16,408
If you don't, that's fine, too.

324
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:20,871
Yes.

325
00:19:22,998 --> 00:19:23,999
Yes.

326
00:19:25,167 --> 00:19:26,335
Yes.

327
00:19:29,755 --> 00:19:31,214
I am in love.

328
00:19:35,677 --> 00:19:36,887
I dare.

329
00:19:40,515 --> 00:19:43,602
My sole purpose on this
Earth is to love Roxanne.

330
00:19:54,029 --> 00:19:55,239
Do you feel better now?

331
00:19:56,073 --> 00:19:57,532
Do you?

332
00:19:58,992 --> 00:20:03,455
<i>Have you ever wanted something</i>

333
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:07,876
<i>So badly you cannot breathe</i>

334
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:14,258
<i>Have you ever loved someone</i>

335
00:20:16,802 --> 00:20:18,887
<i>Madly</i>

336
00:20:20,222 --> 00:20:22,432
No, I don't think I have.

337
00:20:23,433 --> 00:20:25,394
Isn't she magnificent?

338
00:20:25,477 --> 00:20:27,646
She is, though perhaps a little vain.

339
00:20:27,729 --> 00:20:29,314
Yes, but magnificently so.

340
00:20:29,398 --> 00:20:31,316
There's some pretension in there, too.

341
00:20:32,025 --> 00:20:33,485
She's full of it.

342
00:20:33,569 --> 00:20:35,195
I wasn't sure about her hair today.

343
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:36,405
Agreed.

344
00:20:36,488 --> 00:20:40,659
But even her imperfections are perfect.

345
00:20:46,206 --> 00:20:48,292
In our little town, back in the day...

346
00:20:49,501 --> 00:20:52,921
she was practically worshipped.

347
00:20:56,091 --> 00:20:59,177
To some she was notorious.

348
00:20:59,261 --> 00:21:02,014
To me, glorious.

349
00:21:02,097 --> 00:21:03,348
Does she know?

350
00:21:03,432 --> 00:21:04,892
Do you think a person of her beauty...

351
00:21:04,975 --> 00:21:07,811
in mind, body, and soul
doesn't know about it?

352
00:21:07,895 --> 00:21:10,606
I mean, does she know that
you're in love with her?

353
00:21:10,689 --> 00:21:11,690
No.

354
00:21:11,773 --> 00:21:13,817
No.

355
00:21:13,901 --> 00:21:16,445
No. Someone like me
supposing to love perfection?

356
00:21:16,528 --> 00:21:17,779
No. If I confessed...

357
00:21:18,614 --> 00:21:19,823
she'd never see me again.

358
00:21:19,907 --> 00:21:21,700
You don't have a very high opinion of her.

359
00:21:21,783 --> 00:21:23,201
What? She's the Alps.

360
00:21:23,285 --> 00:21:25,621
No, but you don't think
she has the depth...

361
00:21:25,704 --> 00:21:26,872
- to look beyond your...
- Careful.

362
00:21:26,955 --> 00:21:28,248
- ...unique physique.
- Not bad.

363
00:21:28,332 --> 00:21:29,708
Thank you.

364
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,251
To love you for who you are
and not for how you look.

365
00:21:31,335 --> 00:21:32,628
Yes, but don't you see?

366
00:21:32,711 --> 00:21:34,796
I am simply not worthy of her.

367
00:21:36,256 --> 00:21:40,719
<i>I've held my breath since I saw her</i>

368
00:21:40,802 --> 00:21:42,804
<i>I've tried to look
away but I can't resist</i>

369
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:52,481
<i>I know every detail of her</i>

370
00:21:52,564 --> 00:21:54,358
<i>I made a list</i>

371
00:21:57,736 --> 00:22:00,280
<i>I can't tell you how long</i>

372
00:22:00,364 --> 00:22:03,408
<i>I've thought about her</i>

373
00:22:03,492 --> 00:22:07,204
<i>I've kept everything she's missed</i>

374
00:22:08,747 --> 00:22:11,583
<i>She's gonna laugh at the one</i>

375
00:22:11,667 --> 00:22:16,588
<i>That brings her love like this</i>

376
00:22:20,384 --> 00:22:25,138
<i>Have you ever wanted something</i>

377
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:30,561
<i>So badly you cannot breathe</i>

378
00:22:31,687 --> 00:22:35,857
<i>Have you ever loved someone</i>

379
00:22:37,734 --> 00:22:39,861
<i>Madly</i>

380
00:22:39,945 --> 00:22:43,865
When you were fighting
Valvert, she was anxious.

381
00:22:44,741 --> 00:22:46,618
Oh, she turned quite pale.

382
00:22:46,702 --> 00:22:48,870
Her lips trembled.

383
00:22:48,954 --> 00:22:50,289
They parted.

384
00:22:50,372 --> 00:22:51,415
She touched her heart.

385
00:22:52,332 --> 00:22:53,625
You should tell her.

386
00:22:53,709 --> 00:22:54,793
You love her.

387
00:22:54,876 --> 00:22:57,879
No. My fate is to love her from afar.

388
00:22:59,256 --> 00:23:01,508
To confess is to shatter
the beautiful dream.

389
00:23:01,592 --> 00:23:03,260
You forget, I've seen you in battle.

390
00:23:03,343 --> 00:23:04,678
You're a fighter to the end.

391
00:23:04,761 --> 00:23:06,638
But in love you've raised the white flag.

392
00:23:06,722 --> 00:23:08,640
Have faith in her. Tell her the truth.

393
00:23:08,724 --> 00:23:09,725
A word.

394
00:23:12,436 --> 00:23:14,813
Roxanne wishes to meet with you alone.

395
00:23:14,897 --> 00:23:15,898
What?

396
00:23:15,981 --> 00:23:17,274
Why?

397
00:23:17,357 --> 00:23:19,359
She won't say, no matter
how much I berate her.

398
00:23:19,443 --> 00:23:20,485
But she says it's urgent.

399
00:23:20,569 --> 00:23:21,653
Take me to her at once.

400
00:23:21,737 --> 00:23:23,655
Not now, you vulgar person. At night?

401
00:23:24,448 --> 00:23:25,991
Then when?

402
00:23:26,074 --> 00:23:27,743
She'll go to early Mass tomorrow.

403
00:23:27,826 --> 00:23:30,078
After she leaves the
church, she'll meet with you.

404
00:23:30,162 --> 00:23:33,498
Somewhere discreet, she
said it must be private.

405
00:23:33,582 --> 00:23:36,835
I'll thank you, Captain Le
Bret, to lower that eyebrow.

406
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:38,712
There is nothing unseemly here.

407
00:23:38,795 --> 00:23:40,923
I bow to your expertise in the matter.

408
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,425
A venue, please.

409
00:23:46,762 --> 00:23:49,097
I've never seen him silent
before, it's quite appealing.

410
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,766
Let me think.

411
00:23:50,849 --> 00:23:52,184
- Where?
- I'm thinking where.

412
00:23:52,267 --> 00:23:53,936
- Where?
- Ragueneau's.

413
00:23:54,019 --> 00:23:55,395
Seven o'clock. She'll be there.

414
00:23:55,479 --> 00:23:56,480
I will, too.

415
00:23:57,022 --> 00:23:58,023
And so will I.

416
00:23:58,106 --> 00:23:59,107
Good night.

417
00:24:03,612 --> 00:24:04,947
She wants to see me privately.

418
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,156
There it is.

419
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,241
Alone.

420
00:24:08,283 --> 00:24:10,494
Oh, no. I cannot succumb to hope!

421
00:24:10,577 --> 00:24:12,037
Hope is madness. Hope is hell.

422
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,205
Hope is life!

423
00:24:13,288 --> 00:24:15,249
Oh, I need an army to vanquish!

424
00:24:15,332 --> 00:24:17,209
I have ten hearts, I have twenty arms.

425
00:24:17,292 --> 00:24:19,127
I could kill a hundred men.

426
00:24:19,211 --> 00:24:20,504
Good night, my friend.

427
00:24:20,587 --> 00:24:22,047
And good luck tomorrow.

428
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:24,424
This could be it.

429
00:24:24,508 --> 00:24:25,968
Oh, have faith.

430
00:24:27,135 --> 00:24:28,595
Where are you off to, this late hour?

431
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:30,597
Some things are private.

432
00:24:30,681 --> 00:24:32,307
Thank you for dinner.

433
00:24:34,518 --> 00:24:39,147
<i>Have you ever loved someone</i>

434
00:24:39,231 --> 00:24:41,608
<i>Madly</i>

435
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:05,090
Well, I'd hoped to fight
100, but ten will do.

436
00:26:38,934 --> 00:26:40,018
Morning, Ragueneau.

437
00:26:40,102 --> 00:26:41,353
Cyrano! Just the man!

438
00:26:41,436 --> 00:26:42,521
What time is it?

439
00:26:42,604 --> 00:26:43,689
Almost 6:00.

440
00:26:43,772 --> 00:26:45,816
I'm up with the muse, so to speak.

441
00:26:45,899 --> 00:26:49,027
A poem. Her soul eludes me.

442
00:26:49,111 --> 00:26:51,113
Needs your expert ear.

443
00:26:51,196 --> 00:26:54,032
I'm told you have a private room.

444
00:26:54,116 --> 00:26:56,743
I mean, a room where two
people can have some privacy.

445
00:26:56,827 --> 00:26:58,120
Bit early for an assignation.

446
00:26:58,203 --> 00:27:00,872
I mean talk privately without interruption.

447
00:27:00,956 --> 00:27:02,124
I'll show you.

448
00:27:02,207 --> 00:27:04,835
Simultaneously, I'll
recite what I have so far.

449
00:27:04,918 --> 00:27:08,380
The poem is entitled "Constellation."

450
00:27:08,463 --> 00:27:09,506
Good, eh?

451
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,591
Terrific.

452
00:27:16,763 --> 00:27:18,140
Dear Roxanne.

453
00:27:20,017 --> 00:27:21,310
Dear Roxanne.

454
00:27:26,148 --> 00:27:31,778
<i>Every morning at the break of light</i>

455
00:27:31,862 --> 00:27:36,325
<i>I see you standing in the sun</i>

456
00:27:37,618 --> 00:27:43,957
<i>You look at me with the kindest eyes</i>

457
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:48,128
<i>Every morning I'm overcome</i>

458
00:27:48,211 --> 00:27:50,797
"My heavenly earthly desire."

459
00:27:52,507 --> 00:27:54,301
Heavenly earthly, eh?

460
00:27:54,384 --> 00:27:55,385
How's this?

461
00:27:57,596 --> 00:27:59,348
Something more private?

462
00:27:59,431 --> 00:28:01,433
I understand. Discretion.

463
00:28:01,516 --> 00:28:03,060
Now...

464
00:28:03,143 --> 00:28:07,522
"Jupiter and Pluto are planets,
revolving like us, far apart."

465
00:28:07,606 --> 00:28:13,612
<i>Sorrow and glory and
blinding euphoria</i>

466
00:28:13,695 --> 00:28:17,699
<i>Everything's there in your name</i>

467
00:28:17,783 --> 00:28:20,869
"May I woo you with my art."

468
00:28:22,788 --> 00:28:24,623
- Good.
- That's it thus far.

469
00:28:24,706 --> 00:28:26,792
There's a long way to go, but be brutal.

470
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:29,086
Do you think the planetary metaphor holds?

471
00:28:34,383 --> 00:28:36,134
Perhaps consider sublimation.

472
00:28:36,218 --> 00:28:37,219
Right.

473
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,596
A different pattern of imagery.

474
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,557
Maybe something you know intimately.

475
00:28:42,933 --> 00:28:44,726
Anything in mind?

476
00:28:45,435 --> 00:28:46,979
<i>Baking?</i>

477
00:28:47,062 --> 00:28:51,483
Sensuality and longing expressed
through the act of baking.

478
00:28:51,567 --> 00:28:52,651
<i>Why not?</i>

479
00:28:52,734 --> 00:28:54,319
<i>Rising dough.</i>

480
00:28:54,403 --> 00:28:56,738
<i>Flour. Ovens.</i>

481
00:28:56,822 --> 00:28:57,864
<i>Heat.</i>

482
00:28:57,948 --> 00:28:59,491
Oh, my God. Thank you.

483
00:29:00,117 --> 00:29:01,118
Thank you!

484
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,290
Thank you!

485
00:29:09,835 --> 00:29:15,424
<i>In darkness when I close my eyes</i>

486
00:29:15,507 --> 00:29:19,469
<i>I see your hair come undone</i>

487
00:29:21,263 --> 00:29:27,394
<i>I lose myself every time</i>

488
00:29:27,477 --> 00:29:31,315
<i>Even now I'm overcome</i>

489
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:39,448
<i>Roxanne, what am I supposed to say?</i>

490
00:29:39,531 --> 00:29:44,536
<i>Words are only glass on a string</i>

491
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:47,414
<i>The more I arrange them</i>

492
00:29:47,497 --> 00:29:51,043
<i>And line up and change them</i>

493
00:29:51,126 --> 00:29:54,963
<i>The more they mean the same thing</i>

494
00:29:57,341 --> 00:29:58,884
<i>Roxanne</i>

495
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,803
<i>Roxanne</i>

496
00:30:03,305 --> 00:30:05,140
<i>Roxanne</i>

497
00:30:09,144 --> 00:30:10,562
Roxanne!

498
00:30:10,646 --> 00:30:11,939
Roxanne.

499
00:30:19,655 --> 00:30:20,989
Do you like rabbit stew?

500
00:30:21,073 --> 00:30:22,574
I loathe rabbits.

501
00:30:22,658 --> 00:30:24,743
I hate their taste, and I hate
the way they savage a garden.

502
00:30:24,826 --> 00:30:25,911
Shank of lamb?

503
00:30:25,994 --> 00:30:27,246
She likes tongue.

504
00:30:29,289 --> 00:30:31,583
For heaven's sake, Marie.

505
00:30:31,667 --> 00:30:33,126
Go and eat.

506
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:34,461
Fine.

507
00:30:34,544 --> 00:30:36,838
And I'll pray for your sins while I do.

508
00:30:39,508 --> 00:30:41,635
A huge slab of tongue. Keep it coming.

509
00:30:41,718 --> 00:30:43,011
Righto.

510
00:30:45,764 --> 00:30:48,725
I have a confession to make.

511
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,146
Shall we sit?

512
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,314
You're wounded.

513
00:30:54,398 --> 00:30:55,399
A scratch.

514
00:30:56,525 --> 00:30:58,110
I know your shoddy work.

515
00:30:58,193 --> 00:31:00,320
The dressing is loose.

516
00:31:00,404 --> 00:31:01,655
Your confession?

517
00:31:01,738 --> 00:31:02,906
Can wait a moment.

518
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:04,324
It's only a scratch.

519
00:31:04,408 --> 00:31:07,786
It's a wound, and it needs cleaning.

520
00:31:07,869 --> 00:31:10,247
I've been wounded many times.

521
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:12,124
This is not a wound.

522
00:31:12,207 --> 00:31:14,293
Then we'll call it a cut.

523
00:31:14,376 --> 00:31:15,627
"Scratch" is more accurate.

524
00:31:15,711 --> 00:31:17,796
I dispute "more."

525
00:31:17,879 --> 00:31:20,048
A thing is either accurate or it isn't.

526
00:31:21,592 --> 00:31:23,218
There are no degrees of accuracy.

527
00:31:24,052 --> 00:31:25,637
You taught me that.

528
00:31:25,721 --> 00:31:27,097
As you wish.

529
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,599
I'll settle for "cut."

530
00:31:29,433 --> 00:31:31,226
A deep one.

531
00:31:35,272 --> 00:31:36,481
How did you get it?

532
00:31:36,565 --> 00:31:38,317
Last night. A duel.

533
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,526
And look what happens.

534
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:40,986
You should see the other guys.

535
00:31:41,069 --> 00:31:42,362
I'm not impressed by your swordsmanship.

536
00:31:42,446 --> 00:31:43,614
Oh, I know.

537
00:31:43,697 --> 00:31:46,658
Or rather, I know you pretend you're not.

538
00:31:46,742 --> 00:31:48,994
I'd be very angry with you if you died.

539
00:31:49,077 --> 00:31:50,120
Only angry?

540
00:31:50,203 --> 00:31:51,747
Incandescent.

541
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,165
This might hurt.

542
00:31:55,751 --> 00:31:57,002
So brave.

543
00:31:58,837 --> 00:32:00,672
Will you make your confession?

544
00:32:00,756 --> 00:32:01,965
Yes, I must.

545
00:32:02,049 --> 00:32:04,635
And there's only so much
tongue Marie can chew on.

546
00:32:14,478 --> 00:32:16,021
I feel shy.

547
00:32:23,028 --> 00:32:24,196
Never mind.

548
00:32:27,783 --> 00:32:30,035
Yesterday, at the theater...

549
00:32:30,118 --> 00:32:31,119
Yes?

550
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,249
I can barely believe I'm saying this.

551
00:32:35,332 --> 00:32:40,295
I realized, or became aware, suddenly...

552
00:32:41,505 --> 00:32:43,048
that I was in love.

553
00:32:43,131 --> 00:32:44,508
I see.

554
00:32:44,591 --> 00:32:47,594
I am madly in love, but the
man in question has no idea.

555
00:32:47,678 --> 00:32:49,429
And I don't know how to tell him.

556
00:32:49,513 --> 00:32:51,306
Perhaps he feels the same?

557
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:53,225
It's possible. I have hopes.

558
00:32:53,308 --> 00:32:55,060
How do you know you love him?

559
00:32:55,143 --> 00:32:57,437
Because it's as if I've always known.

560
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,731
Always known him.

561
00:32:59,815 --> 00:33:01,400
He was always there...

562
00:33:01,483 --> 00:33:03,193
but this intense romantic
connection had not yet manifested.

563
00:33:03,277 --> 00:33:05,362
I understand.

564
00:33:05,445 --> 00:33:06,738
Supposing it's all a delusion?

565
00:33:06,822 --> 00:33:08,073
No, you're clearly in love.

566
00:33:08,156 --> 00:33:09,449
My mind is racing. I'm feverish.

567
00:33:09,533 --> 00:33:10,576
- Would you like some water?
- No.

568
00:33:10,659 --> 00:33:11,952
It's got your blood in it.

569
00:33:12,035 --> 00:33:13,620
- You were saying?
- I don't know what I was saying.

570
00:33:13,704 --> 00:33:15,914
Tell me about him. It might
reassure you there's no delusion.

571
00:33:15,998 --> 00:33:17,082
Yes.

572
00:33:18,166 --> 00:33:19,167
Good.

573
00:33:21,044 --> 00:33:24,172
I feel he is rather proud.

574
00:33:29,011 --> 00:33:31,096
And very charming.

575
00:33:31,179 --> 00:33:35,475
He is mysterious, but not obscure.

576
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:38,937
And his face is so
bright with intelligence.

577
00:33:39,021 --> 00:33:40,022
What else?

578
00:33:42,649 --> 00:33:45,110
He's very beautiful, obviously.

579
00:33:45,193 --> 00:33:46,862
Is he?

580
00:33:46,945 --> 00:33:49,615
Yes. But his natural modesty means
he's completely unaware of it.

581
00:33:49,698 --> 00:33:51,033
I've met people like that.

582
00:33:51,116 --> 00:33:52,284
- They are so rare.
- Yes.

583
00:33:52,367 --> 00:33:54,244
Perhaps I could make a confession, too?

584
00:33:54,328 --> 00:33:55,662
Yes, but I haven't made mine yet.

585
00:33:55,746 --> 00:33:57,247
I'm sorry. Please continue.

586
00:33:57,331 --> 00:33:58,582
This man I love is a guard.

587
00:33:58,665 --> 00:33:59,750
In your regiment.

588
00:33:59,833 --> 00:34:01,251
- Of course he is.
- Of course?

589
00:34:01,335 --> 00:34:02,419
In the sense that...

590
00:34:02,502 --> 00:34:05,130
I interrupted. Please continue.

591
00:34:05,213 --> 00:34:08,967
It's embarrassing to admit, but
I've never actually spoken to him.

592
00:34:09,051 --> 00:34:11,511
- Of your love?
- Of anything.

593
00:34:11,595 --> 00:34:12,971
It was love at first sight.

594
00:34:13,055 --> 00:34:14,681
A thunderbolt. It's madness.

595
00:34:14,765 --> 00:34:15,849
Fantastical.

596
00:34:15,933 --> 00:34:18,602
And yet it's absolutely...

597
00:34:19,895 --> 00:34:20,896
real.

598
00:34:30,697 --> 00:34:31,865
- Cyrano?
- Here.

599
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:34,076
- You seem...
- Just the wound playing up.

600
00:34:35,118 --> 00:34:36,245
Poor you.

601
00:34:37,412 --> 00:34:39,081
I have some ointment at home.

602
00:34:44,419 --> 00:34:48,715
Supposing he's an idiot.

603
00:34:48,799 --> 00:34:52,511
He might just be an
incredibly beautiful man...

604
00:34:52,594 --> 00:34:54,263
with the mind of a rabbit.

605
00:34:57,099 --> 00:34:58,100
Except he isn't.

606
00:35:00,143 --> 00:35:01,603
He can't be.

607
00:35:02,604 --> 00:35:04,189
I need him not to be.

608
00:35:08,443 --> 00:35:12,489
Anyway, I've made some
discreet inquiries...

609
00:35:12,573 --> 00:35:15,033
and I am told that he is Christian.

610
00:35:15,117 --> 00:35:16,201
Christian Neuvillette.

611
00:35:16,285 --> 00:35:18,203
"Neuvillette"? Never heard of him.

612
00:35:18,287 --> 00:35:19,997
He's a new recruit.

613
00:35:20,622 --> 00:35:21,999
He starts today.

614
00:35:26,461 --> 00:35:27,754
To the point.

615
00:35:29,006 --> 00:35:30,465
To your presence here...

616
00:35:32,843 --> 00:35:35,095
I know how the guards
treat the new recruits...

617
00:35:35,178 --> 00:35:37,931
your ancient initiation rituals and so on.

618
00:35:38,015 --> 00:35:40,225
So, please, will you protect him?

619
00:35:40,309 --> 00:35:42,060
I can refuse you nothing.

620
00:35:42,144 --> 00:35:43,520
And never let him fight a duel?

621
00:35:43,604 --> 00:35:44,688
No.

622
00:35:44,771 --> 00:35:46,064
And guard his life with your own?

623
00:35:46,148 --> 00:35:47,232
Yes.

624
00:35:47,316 --> 00:35:48,775
And be his friend?

625
00:35:48,859 --> 00:35:50,652
I might not like him.

626
00:35:50,736 --> 00:35:53,113
All the same. Befriend him.

627
00:35:53,196 --> 00:35:54,239
Yes.

628
00:35:54,323 --> 00:35:56,033
And make him write to me.

629
00:35:56,783 --> 00:35:58,535
And I'll write back.

630
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:01,121
We'll exchange long, poetic love letters.

631
00:36:01,204 --> 00:36:02,581
I will suggest that he write to you...

632
00:36:02,664 --> 00:36:05,417
but I cannot control the
content or length of his letters.

633
00:36:08,003 --> 00:36:09,671
You are always so kind.

634
00:36:16,678 --> 00:36:17,679
No.

635
00:36:19,765 --> 00:36:22,226
You said you have a
confession to make, too.

636
00:36:24,186 --> 00:36:25,687
It's not important.

637
00:36:25,771 --> 00:36:27,356
I will support you as you've supported me.

638
00:36:27,439 --> 00:36:29,066
Really, it's nothing.

639
00:36:31,235 --> 00:36:32,611
How's the hand?

640
00:36:32,694 --> 00:36:33,779
Painless.

641
00:36:33,862 --> 00:36:35,447
A scratch.

642
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:37,783
How many men did you duel with last night?

643
00:36:37,866 --> 00:36:39,159
A hundred.

644
00:36:39,243 --> 00:36:40,535
Really?

645
00:36:40,911 --> 00:36:42,246
Ten.

646
00:36:44,456 --> 00:36:47,000
All the same, what courage.

647
00:36:50,545 --> 00:36:52,214
I've done better since.

648
00:36:55,717 --> 00:36:58,178
And one, two, three.

649
00:36:58,262 --> 00:37:01,473
One, two, three. One, two, three.

650
00:37:01,557 --> 00:37:04,643
One, two, three. One, two, three.

651
00:37:04,726 --> 00:37:07,729
One, two, three. One, two, three.

652
00:37:07,813 --> 00:37:10,816
One, two, three. One, two, three.

653
00:37:10,899 --> 00:37:12,651
One, two, three.

654
00:37:12,734 --> 00:37:16,196
And one, two. One, two.

655
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,574
One, two. One, two.

656
00:37:18,657 --> 00:37:21,159
One, two. One, two.

657
00:37:21,243 --> 00:37:23,036
One, two, three.

658
00:37:23,954 --> 00:37:25,414
Captain.

659
00:37:27,249 --> 00:37:30,419
I heard of your recent adventures.

660
00:37:30,502 --> 00:37:33,171
I've come to express my admiration.

661
00:37:33,255 --> 00:37:34,298
Cyrano.

662
00:37:37,301 --> 00:37:40,512
I'm inviting you to join my retinue.

663
00:37:40,596 --> 00:37:45,100
I thank the Duke for his generous
offer, but I must decline.

664
00:37:45,851 --> 00:37:47,519
Carry on!

665
00:37:47,603 --> 00:37:50,063
There are a great many
advantages to following me.

666
00:37:50,147 --> 00:37:51,231
I know.

667
00:37:51,315 --> 00:37:54,693
But I follow no one.

668
00:37:54,776 --> 00:37:59,072
I'm told that you write poetry in
common with a great many men these days.

669
00:37:59,156 --> 00:38:02,701
However, I'm told that you
write poetry uncommonly well.

670
00:38:02,784 --> 00:38:05,412
I like to publish those that I admire.

671
00:38:05,495 --> 00:38:08,040
I could put you into
print, distinguish you.

672
00:38:08,123 --> 00:38:10,417
I'd only change a few
lines. I pay handsomely.

673
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,712
You could buy a fine
pair of calfskin gloves.

674
00:38:13,795 --> 00:38:15,547
I'm not for sale. Neither is my work.

675
00:38:15,631 --> 00:38:17,549
- Aren't you proud.
- Aren't you observant.

676
00:38:17,633 --> 00:38:19,551
Take this seriously.

677
00:38:19,635 --> 00:38:21,637
Those men last night were incompetent.

678
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,347
Others may not be.

679
00:38:25,182 --> 00:38:26,725
Someone's taken against you.

680
00:38:26,808 --> 00:38:29,895
Join my retinue, you'll be protected.

681
00:38:29,978 --> 00:38:32,397
First, you try to recruit
me, then you try to buy me.

682
00:38:32,481 --> 00:38:34,650
When you learn I have no price...

683
00:38:34,733 --> 00:38:38,195
you warn me that my life is
threatened by an unknown enemy.

684
00:38:38,278 --> 00:38:39,821
I saw you last night.

685
00:38:39,905 --> 00:38:41,865
The blood of those men is on your hands.

686
00:38:41,949 --> 00:38:44,243
You're a tyrant posing as a noble.

687
00:38:44,326 --> 00:38:46,745
Oh, what a shame we can't
accommodate each other.

688
00:38:46,828 --> 00:38:48,413
'Cause you know something?

689
00:38:48,497 --> 00:38:51,124
You'd make a sweet little companion
to the acquisition I will make.

690
00:38:51,541 --> 00:38:52,751
Roxanne.

691
00:38:54,711 --> 00:38:55,921
Guards!

692
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,050
<i>Don't push him too far.</i>

693
00:39:00,133 --> 00:39:02,511
To be his enemy is a badge of honor.

694
00:39:02,594 --> 00:39:03,887
Which might get you killed.

695
00:39:03,971 --> 00:39:05,055
Let him try.

696
00:39:05,138 --> 00:39:07,015
I'll best any he sends.

697
00:39:07,099 --> 00:39:08,141
Let them come.

698
00:39:08,225 --> 00:39:09,601
He offered you a good wage.

699
00:39:09,685 --> 00:39:10,769
I belong here.

700
00:39:10,852 --> 00:39:12,938
With you. With them.

701
00:39:13,021 --> 00:39:16,024
Left! Left! Left! Right! Left!

702
00:39:16,108 --> 00:39:18,610
<i>I will not be his toy.</i>

703
00:39:18,694 --> 00:39:20,529
What would you have me do, Le Bret?

704
00:39:21,363 --> 00:39:22,948
Join his retinue?

705
00:39:23,031 --> 00:39:24,116
No, thank you.

706
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:26,785
<i>Dedicate poems to de Guiche?</i>

707
00:39:26,868 --> 00:39:28,036
<i>No, thank you.</i>

708
00:39:35,586 --> 00:39:36,878
I've heard how this works.

709
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,881
Who's first?

710
00:39:44,887 --> 00:39:47,264
Do you want me to swallow insults?

711
00:39:47,347 --> 00:39:49,641
To crawl? To kneel? To beg?

712
00:39:49,725 --> 00:39:51,727
Play both sides? Flatter? No, thank you.

713
00:39:53,604 --> 00:39:56,148
<i>Live for other people's
opinions of me?</i>

714
00:39:56,231 --> 00:39:59,151
No, thank you. I prefer
a different life. My own.

715
00:39:59,234 --> 00:40:01,987
I answer to no one, and
I am content, thank you.

716
00:40:04,448 --> 00:40:05,574
She doesn't love you?

717
00:40:07,451 --> 00:40:08,535
Don't...

718
00:40:08,619 --> 00:40:09,912
ever say it.

719
00:40:11,914 --> 00:40:13,624
Who's next?

720
00:40:15,751 --> 00:40:16,752
I am.

721
00:40:17,419 --> 00:40:18,420
Cyrano!

722
00:40:21,632 --> 00:40:25,719
Cyrano! Cyrano! Cyrano!

723
00:40:27,554 --> 00:40:29,181
What's so funny?

724
00:40:29,264 --> 00:40:32,184
First, I fight an elephant, and now a mole?

725
00:40:33,393 --> 00:40:35,103
What's your name?

726
00:40:35,187 --> 00:40:36,396
Why?

727
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,650
I just like to know the
names of the men I kill.

728
00:40:42,277 --> 00:40:44,947
I'm Christian Neuvillette, sir.

729
00:40:47,824 --> 00:40:49,117
Embrace me.

730
00:40:51,495 --> 00:40:52,663
Sir!

731
00:40:56,041 --> 00:40:57,292
I'm her brother.

732
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,344
Whose brother?

733
00:41:07,427 --> 00:41:08,804
Who do you think?

734
00:41:08,887 --> 00:41:10,013
- Roxanne.
- Roxanne?

735
00:41:10,097 --> 00:41:11,139
Hmm.

736
00:41:13,141 --> 00:41:14,434
Yes.

737
00:41:14,518 --> 00:41:15,811
You don't look like her brother.

738
00:41:15,894 --> 00:41:17,896
We're old friends, like siblings but not.

739
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,064
We're very close.

740
00:41:19,147 --> 00:41:20,399
- And what...
- She's told me everything.

741
00:41:20,482 --> 00:41:22,234
The theater, love at
first sight, all of it.

742
00:41:22,317 --> 00:41:23,527
She loves me?

743
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:24,987
She believes so.

744
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:26,530
Sir, I am so glad to know you!

745
00:41:26,613 --> 00:41:27,864
Yes, enough of that.

746
00:41:27,948 --> 00:41:29,241
- Please forgive me for insulting you earlier.
- Yes.

747
00:41:29,324 --> 00:41:30,325
- I just...
- Yes, yes.

748
00:41:30,409 --> 00:41:32,244
- She loves me!
- Now, listen.

749
00:41:32,327 --> 00:41:33,704
She loves me!

750
00:41:33,787 --> 00:41:35,455
Roxanne wants a letter from you.

751
00:41:36,707 --> 00:41:37,749
- No?
- Impossible.

752
00:41:37,833 --> 00:41:38,917
If I write to her, it'll drive her away.

753
00:41:39,001 --> 00:41:40,085
Really? Why?

754
00:41:40,168 --> 00:41:41,169
I can't write love letters.

755
00:41:41,253 --> 00:41:42,254
Rabbit.

756
00:41:42,337 --> 00:41:43,797
Sorry?

757
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:47,593
You just say what you feel.

758
00:41:47,676 --> 00:41:50,178
As long as it's true, you can't go wrong.

759
00:41:50,262 --> 00:41:53,557
But a woman like Roxanne
wants wit, romance.

760
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,934
Maybe even poetry.

761
00:41:56,018 --> 00:41:57,185
You're right.

762
00:41:57,269 --> 00:41:59,438
You'd better leave town.

763
00:41:59,521 --> 00:42:00,522
Oh, I didn't mean it.

764
00:42:01,189 --> 00:42:02,232
I'm very confused.

765
00:42:02,316 --> 00:42:03,942
Are you here to help me or hinder me?

766
00:42:04,026 --> 00:42:05,277
- Help.
- Good.

767
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,195
You see, in battle I
have inordinate courage.

768
00:42:07,279 --> 00:42:08,614
I can do anything.

769
00:42:08,697 --> 00:42:11,450
But with women, my whole
life I've been useless.

770
00:42:11,533 --> 00:42:13,035
Silent. I'm...

771
00:42:13,118 --> 00:42:15,287
What's the word for when you're
bad at expressing yourself?

772
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:16,997
- Inarticulate.
- That's it.

773
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:20,959
I can't explain what I feel,
not on paper, and not on paper.

774
00:42:21,043 --> 00:42:23,128
I don't know how to speak romantically.

775
00:42:23,211 --> 00:42:24,963
Roxanne will be extremely disappointed.

776
00:42:25,047 --> 00:42:26,131
She must not be.

777
00:42:26,214 --> 00:42:27,341
But I have no wit.

778
00:42:32,221 --> 00:42:33,388
Borrow mine.

779
00:42:36,934 --> 00:42:39,436
My words upon your lips.

780
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:40,604
I can't. It's a lie.

781
00:42:40,687 --> 00:42:41,813
I'd be deceiving the woman I love.

782
00:42:41,897 --> 00:42:43,148
It's better than losing her.

783
00:42:43,232 --> 00:42:45,317
Call it a fantasy, call it
a dream, call it pretend.

784
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,778
A dream might be a lie, but it's also true.

785
00:42:47,861 --> 00:42:48,904
Wait, what?

786
00:42:48,987 --> 00:42:51,323
Sometimes illusion is kind.

787
00:42:51,406 --> 00:42:53,075
- Is it?
- I think so.

788
00:42:53,158 --> 00:42:54,826
Read a book or two. You'll find out.

789
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:56,161
There's no need to be patronizing.

790
00:42:56,245 --> 00:42:57,246
I'm sorry.

791
00:42:57,329 --> 00:42:58,330
Accepted.

792
00:42:58,413 --> 00:42:59,498
But will the deceit work?

793
00:42:59,581 --> 00:43:01,166
Is the prize not worth the risk?

794
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:02,668
Yes.

795
00:43:02,751 --> 00:43:04,086
Oh, Roxanne...

796
00:43:04,169 --> 00:43:05,545
Oh, Roxanne...

797
00:43:07,422 --> 00:43:10,425
will be so pleased to receive your letter.

798
00:43:13,053 --> 00:43:15,556
May I ask, why are you helping me?

799
00:43:16,598 --> 00:43:18,809
What can you gain?

800
00:43:18,892 --> 00:43:22,354
My words go to waste unless spoken aloud.

801
00:43:22,437 --> 00:43:26,191
I will make you eloquent
while you make me handsome.

802
00:43:28,902 --> 00:43:34,366
<i>God, what I'd do to
just be able to tell her</i>

803
00:43:34,449 --> 00:43:37,578
<i>What it's like when I see her</i>

804
00:43:41,123 --> 00:43:42,874
<i>It's something like</i>

805
00:43:42,958 --> 00:43:44,042
<i>Happiness</i>

806
00:43:44,126 --> 00:43:45,836
<i>It's something like</i>

807
00:43:45,919 --> 00:43:47,129
<i>Hunger</i>

808
00:43:47,212 --> 00:43:48,714
<i>And something like</i>

809
00:43:48,797 --> 00:43:51,049
<i>Fear</i>

810
00:43:51,133 --> 00:43:55,846
<i>I'd give anything for someone to say</i>

811
00:43:57,472 --> 00:44:00,309
<i>All the words I don't have</i>

812
00:44:00,392 --> 00:44:03,395
<i>And I can't put together</i>

813
00:44:03,478 --> 00:44:09,526
<i>I'd give anything for
someone to say to her</i>

814
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:13,405
<i>That she's all I can think about</i>

815
00:44:13,488 --> 00:44:16,325
<i>And I can't live without her</i>

816
00:44:32,257 --> 00:44:35,427
<i>My father told me</i>

817
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:42,517
<i>Letters and books weren't
meant for the son of a soldier</i>

818
00:44:44,853 --> 00:44:47,606
<i>Courage and steel</i>

819
00:44:47,689 --> 00:44:52,194
<i>The trials of the real
world are what matter</i>

820
00:44:52,277 --> 00:44:55,364
<i>And all that should mold you</i>

821
00:44:57,199 --> 00:44:59,201
<i>God, what I'd do</i>

822
00:44:59,284 --> 00:45:02,996
<i>To have the one thing that you have</i>

823
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,290
<i>That I never will</i>

824
00:45:08,877 --> 00:45:12,339
<i>You have something worth giving</i>

825
00:45:12,422 --> 00:45:15,175
<i>A reason for living</i>

826
00:45:15,259 --> 00:45:16,760
<i>All I do well is...</i>

827
00:45:16,843 --> 00:45:17,844
<i>Kill</i>

828
00:45:19,471 --> 00:45:24,309
<i>I'd give anything for someone to say</i>

829
00:45:25,686 --> 00:45:28,814
<i>All the words I don't have</i>

830
00:45:28,897 --> 00:45:31,817
<i>And I can't put together</i>

831
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:36,947
<i>I'd give anything for
someone to say to her</i>

832
00:45:38,282 --> 00:45:39,992
<i>That she's all I can think about</i>

833
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:44,329
<i>And I can't live without her</i>

834
00:45:44,413 --> 00:45:49,209
<i>I'd give anything for someone to say</i>

835
00:45:50,586 --> 00:45:53,964
<i>That they can't live without me</i>

836
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:56,800
<i>And they'll be there forever</i>

837
00:45:56,884 --> 00:45:59,386
<i>I'd give anything for
someone to say to me</i>

838
00:46:03,056 --> 00:46:06,852
<i>That no matter how bad it gets</i>

839
00:46:06,935 --> 00:46:10,772
<i>They won't turn away from me</i>

840
00:46:15,777 --> 00:46:17,070
Here.

841
00:46:18,530 --> 00:46:20,532
Just sign your name on the bottom.

842
00:46:20,616 --> 00:46:22,159
Great. When did you write it?

843
00:46:22,242 --> 00:46:23,452
A while ago.

844
00:46:23,535 --> 00:46:25,162
- But...
- I always have a letter in my pocket...

845
00:46:25,245 --> 00:46:26,997
written to an imaginary woman.

846
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,540
It's the romantic custom here.

847
00:46:28,624 --> 00:46:30,542
But don't you need to
make it specific to her?

848
00:46:30,626 --> 00:46:33,712
Count on vanity to make Roxanne
think it is only for her.

849
00:46:33,795 --> 00:46:36,340
But the letter itself is
applicable to all women?

850
00:46:36,423 --> 00:46:38,884
Not all.

851
00:46:38,967 --> 00:46:41,220
I'm convinced we're destined
to be friends for life.

852
00:46:41,303 --> 00:46:42,846
You think?

853
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:44,473
The very best of friends.

854
00:46:58,153 --> 00:47:00,530
And I, my heart will lend.

855
00:47:09,748 --> 00:47:10,832
Roxanne's?

856
00:47:11,541 --> 00:47:12,542
Thank you.

857
00:47:15,837 --> 00:47:17,339
Come on, children. Hurry up.

858
00:47:57,879 --> 00:47:58,880
Roxanne...

859
00:48:03,051 --> 00:48:07,514
<i>The ink on the paper
makes me nervous</i>

860
00:48:07,598 --> 00:48:10,976
<i>I nearly lose my vision</i>

861
00:48:11,059 --> 00:48:18,150
<i>And then my breath and my
pulse and my mind quicken</i>

862
00:48:18,233 --> 00:48:21,820
<i>Head below my knees I come alive</i>

863
00:48:21,904 --> 00:48:26,325
<i>With every stroke of every
letter in every line you write</i>

864
00:48:26,408 --> 00:48:29,369
<i>Keeps me awake thinking back</i>

865
00:48:29,453 --> 00:48:34,917
<i>Oh, my first sight of you
was my first heart attack</i>

866
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,545
<i>Every letter makes me lose my reason</i>

867
00:48:38,629 --> 00:48:40,047
<i>Every word is like
your kindest touch</i>

868
00:48:42,925 --> 00:48:46,470
<i>And if I told you
how much I need you</i>

869
00:48:46,553 --> 00:48:49,264
<i>Would you give me
yourself or turn and run?</i>

870
00:48:51,642 --> 00:48:55,479
<i>You light up desire
just by describing it</i>

871
00:48:55,562 --> 00:48:59,316
<i>I read to myself until I go blind</i>

872
00:48:59,399 --> 00:49:03,695
<i>Your words fall around
me all through the night</i>

873
00:49:03,779 --> 00:49:06,865
<i>I can't resist and I
don't want to fight</i>

874
00:49:06,949 --> 00:49:08,742
<i>Will you be held?</i>

875
00:49:08,825 --> 00:49:10,494
<i>Will you be touched?</i>

876
00:49:10,577 --> 00:49:12,496
<i>By my hand through this paper</i>

877
00:49:12,579 --> 00:49:14,706
<i>Is this all too much?</i>

878
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:16,750
<i>Will we be ravaged?</i>

879
00:49:16,833 --> 00:49:18,543
<i>Will we be true?</i>

880
00:49:18,627 --> 00:49:22,673
<i>To somebody perfect
somebody like you</i>

881
00:49:22,756 --> 00:49:24,716
<i>I'm tired of yearning</i>

882
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,718
<i>I'm tired of learning</i>

883
00:49:26,802 --> 00:49:28,679
<i>I need to drink you</i>

884
00:49:28,762 --> 00:49:30,889
<i>My heart has been burning</i>

885
00:49:30,973 --> 00:49:32,808
<i>Ever since I saw you</i>

886
00:49:32,891 --> 00:49:34,893
<i>Backwards through the glass</i>

887
00:49:34,977 --> 00:49:36,728
<i>Of a thin windowpane</i>

888
00:49:36,812 --> 00:49:38,772
<i>Like a thin see-through mask</i>

889
00:49:38,855 --> 00:49:40,816
<i>These words are the truth</i>

890
00:49:40,899 --> 00:49:42,442
<i>Just let them sink in</i>

891
00:49:42,526 --> 00:49:45,070
<i>Through your thin-fingered gloves</i>

892
00:49:45,153 --> 00:49:46,905
<i>To your hand, to your skin</i>

893
00:49:46,989 --> 00:49:48,907
<i>Like ribbons on wrist</i>

894
00:49:48,991 --> 00:49:50,909
<i>Let them hold you and twist</i>

895
00:49:50,993 --> 00:49:53,161
<i>Let them touch you all over</i>

896
00:49:53,245 --> 00:49:55,539
<i>Until you can't resist</i>

897
00:49:55,622 --> 00:49:59,209
<i>Every letter makes me lose my reason</i>

898
00:49:59,293 --> 00:50:03,547
<i>Every word is like
your kindest touch</i>

899
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:07,092
<i>And if I told you
how much I need you</i>

900
00:50:07,175 --> 00:50:11,096
<i>Would you give me
yourself or turn and run?</i>

901
00:50:11,179 --> 00:50:16,226
<i>Would you give me
yourself or turn and run?</i>

902
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:20,230
<i>You light up desire
just by describing it</i>

903
00:50:20,314 --> 00:50:24,192
<i>I read to myself until I go blind</i>

904
00:50:24,276 --> 00:50:28,864
<i>Your words fall around
me all through the night</i>

905
00:50:28,947 --> 00:50:32,576
<i>I can't resist and
I don't wanna fight</i>

906
00:50:32,659 --> 00:50:34,036
<i>Dim the lights</i>

907
00:50:34,119 --> 00:50:36,288
<i>Give me everything I want</i>

908
00:50:36,371 --> 00:50:40,417
<i>Just talk to me like
you do in your songs</i>

909
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:44,463
<i>Your letters are
drawings on me from above</i>

910
00:50:44,546 --> 00:50:49,301
<i>I know who you are And
I know you are love</i>

911
00:50:49,384 --> 00:50:51,428
<i>Every day I think I
couldn't love him any more.</i>

912
00:50:51,511 --> 00:50:53,472
Then a new letter arrives,
and my heart expands...

913
00:50:53,555 --> 00:50:55,057
to accommodate more love.

914
00:51:02,522 --> 00:51:04,483
He understands me instinctively.

915
00:51:04,566 --> 00:51:07,444
He knows exactly what I
respond to, what thrills me.

916
00:51:07,527 --> 00:51:08,612
It's uncanny.

917
00:51:08,695 --> 00:51:10,322
I'm pleased for you.

918
00:51:10,405 --> 00:51:11,615
Are you really?

919
00:51:11,698 --> 00:51:13,158
Why wouldn't I be?

920
00:51:13,242 --> 00:51:15,661
It's quite tedious having to
listen to someone waxing on...

921
00:51:15,744 --> 00:51:17,246
about finding true love.

922
00:51:23,418 --> 00:51:24,753
I wanted to meet with him.

923
00:51:25,879 --> 00:51:27,422
In private.

924
00:51:28,757 --> 00:51:30,259
Can you arrange it?

925
00:51:31,593 --> 00:51:33,887
Would you love him if he wasn't handsome?

926
00:51:35,597 --> 00:51:38,016
I cannot imagine it.

927
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:42,145
He is beautiful, and he
expresses himself beautifully.

928
00:51:44,106 --> 00:51:45,899
It's perfectly logical.

929
00:51:48,277 --> 00:51:51,989
"The more you take of my
heart, the more I have to give.

930
00:51:52,072 --> 00:51:54,616
"Since I need a heart to long for you...

931
00:51:56,076 --> 00:51:59,204
"keep mine and send me yours."

932
00:51:59,288 --> 00:52:02,916
First he has too much
heart, and then not enough?

933
00:52:03,458 --> 00:52:04,543
You're jealous.

934
00:52:04,626 --> 00:52:05,711
Me?

935
00:52:05,794 --> 00:52:07,212
It's fascinating.

936
00:52:07,296 --> 00:52:09,214
You're both brilliant, but
exact opposites in style.

937
00:52:10,465 --> 00:52:12,926
Christian is overt...

938
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,095
passionate...

939
00:52:15,178 --> 00:52:16,221
fiery.

940
00:52:16,305 --> 00:52:17,639
Whereas I?

941
00:52:18,181 --> 00:52:19,808
You are coded...

942
00:52:21,476 --> 00:52:22,561
witty...

943
00:52:22,644 --> 00:52:23,645
rueful.

944
00:52:24,605 --> 00:52:26,106
"Coded"?

945
00:52:26,189 --> 00:52:28,567
His words aren't better than
yours, just differently put.

946
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:30,694
But both are endlessly quotable.

947
00:52:30,777 --> 00:52:32,029
You know his letters by heart?

948
00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:36,491
Every one.

949
00:52:40,495 --> 00:52:42,414
You will arrange the meeting?

950
00:52:42,497 --> 00:52:45,667
As ever, I am at your service.

951
00:52:54,509 --> 00:52:56,136
I've come to say goodbye.

952
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:58,680
I leave tonight for the front.

953
00:52:58,764 --> 00:53:00,641
It's grim, but orders are orders.

954
00:53:01,808 --> 00:53:03,518
We're losing the war.

955
00:53:03,602 --> 00:53:06,313
They've promoted the
nobility to turn it around.

956
00:53:06,396 --> 00:53:09,816
As you can see, they've made me a colonel.

957
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:11,735
Me.

958
00:53:11,818 --> 00:53:15,113
Shows how desperate they are.

959
00:53:15,197 --> 00:53:17,616
Does this new rank put you
in command of the guards?

960
00:53:17,699 --> 00:53:20,452
It does. Cyrano is mine.

961
00:53:20,535 --> 00:53:22,454
And the guards are being sent to the front?

962
00:53:22,537 --> 00:53:24,456
Naturally. They're in my regiment.

963
00:53:24,539 --> 00:53:25,582
All of them?

964
00:53:25,666 --> 00:53:26,667
Of course.

965
00:53:32,839 --> 00:53:35,467
Why so upset, dear lady?

966
00:53:35,551 --> 00:53:36,718
You are going to war.

967
00:53:37,844 --> 00:53:39,596
You might die.

968
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,223
You are leaving tonight.

969
00:53:41,306 --> 00:53:43,308
I am beside myself.

970
00:53:43,392 --> 00:53:47,396
Can I take this as a
sign of your affection?

971
00:53:49,231 --> 00:53:50,816
I must tell you.

972
00:53:50,899 --> 00:53:53,277
Cyrano and I are no longer friends.

973
00:53:53,902 --> 00:53:56,154
Oh?

974
00:53:56,238 --> 00:53:59,199
I ended the friendship, as you counseled.

975
00:53:59,283 --> 00:54:00,367
Good.

976
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:04,496
I know how you could make him suffer.

977
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:05,872
Oh?

978
00:54:05,956 --> 00:54:10,377
Why don't you leave him
and all the guards behind?

979
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:13,672
Here in the city with
the women and children.

980
00:54:13,755 --> 00:54:15,591
Oh, he'll hate that.

981
00:54:15,674 --> 00:54:18,844
More than hate, it would humiliate him.

982
00:54:18,927 --> 00:54:21,847
No heroics, no medals.

983
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:24,600
His warrior pride is his great weakness.

984
00:54:24,683 --> 00:54:29,396
Am I to understand this as an act of love?

985
00:54:31,315 --> 00:54:32,441
It is.

986
00:54:34,776 --> 00:54:38,238
I hereby bury his orders to the front.

987
00:54:39,907 --> 00:54:41,700
Poor little Cyrano...

988
00:54:41,783 --> 00:54:43,410
and his poor little friends.

989
00:54:47,289 --> 00:54:49,416
Marie, some tea.

990
00:54:52,252 --> 00:54:54,171
I'm afraid we are out of tea, sir.

991
00:54:54,254 --> 00:54:55,631
Leave us.

992
00:55:06,558 --> 00:55:09,436
I like your tricks.

993
00:55:11,563 --> 00:55:13,357
I wager you know some more.

994
00:55:13,941 --> 00:55:15,025
No, sir.

995
00:55:15,108 --> 00:55:16,568
Oh, I think you do.

996
00:55:16,652 --> 00:55:18,487
How can I leave you?

997
00:55:19,655 --> 00:55:21,156
Maybe I won't.

998
00:55:22,115 --> 00:55:23,450
Roxanne...

999
00:55:25,827 --> 00:55:27,579
I love you.

1000
00:55:27,663 --> 00:55:29,122
I love you.

1001
00:55:30,666 --> 00:55:32,918
It's a terrible shame, but leave you must.

1002
00:55:33,001 --> 00:55:34,920
The battle can't happen...

1003
00:55:35,003 --> 00:55:36,213
without the colonel.

1004
00:55:39,466 --> 00:55:41,468
I so admire your bravery.

1005
00:55:41,552 --> 00:55:42,761
Yeah, I'm not brave.

1006
00:55:42,844 --> 00:55:45,055
- I'm dutiful.
- You are too modest.

1007
00:55:45,138 --> 00:55:47,558
It is you who will lead
the charge into battle.

1008
00:55:49,309 --> 00:55:52,646
I could not love a man
who hides from danger.

1009
00:55:52,729 --> 00:55:54,523
Do you love me?

1010
00:55:56,149 --> 00:55:58,569
I love the man for whom I fear.

1011
00:56:01,029 --> 00:56:03,407
So I must go to war?

1012
00:56:06,785 --> 00:56:07,786
Yes.

1013
00:56:23,218 --> 00:56:24,803
This is folly.

1014
00:56:24,887 --> 00:56:26,555
She said she wants to meet me, so
what's wrong with surprising her?

1015
00:56:26,638 --> 00:56:27,764
You're not prepared.

1016
00:56:27,848 --> 00:56:28,974
She loves me, I don't need to prepare.

1017
00:56:29,057 --> 00:56:30,726
Why can't you relax?

1018
00:56:30,809 --> 00:56:32,269
Can you at least take a look at
these conversational witticisms?

1019
00:56:32,352 --> 00:56:33,437
No, thank you.

1020
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:34,730
Memorize this now!

1021
00:56:34,813 --> 00:56:36,273
I'm going to speak to her in my own words.

1022
00:56:36,356 --> 00:56:38,525
I strongly advise against that.

1023
00:56:38,609 --> 00:56:40,652
And when the moment is right,
I'll take her in my arms.

1024
00:56:40,736 --> 00:56:43,155
There will be no moment
if you don't study these.

1025
00:56:43,238 --> 00:56:44,740
I'll be fine.

1026
00:56:44,823 --> 00:56:46,992
All your fancy words and phrases
are now a part of my vocabulary.

1027
00:56:47,075 --> 00:56:48,660
I'll simply repeat them.

1028
00:56:48,744 --> 00:56:49,828
No, wait, what is it?

1029
00:56:49,912 --> 00:56:50,996
Regurgitate?

1030
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:52,748
That's it! That's what I will do.

1031
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:54,917
Off you go then.

1032
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:08,680
I'm very grateful for your help...

1033
00:57:08,764 --> 00:57:11,433
but, with extreme respect, I
don't think I need you anymore.

1034
00:57:12,017 --> 00:57:13,018
Very well.

1035
00:57:14,853 --> 00:57:16,563
Fly to Roxanne.

1036
00:57:16,647 --> 00:57:19,399
Dazzle her with your transcendent words.

1037
00:57:22,819 --> 00:57:23,820
Yeah.

1038
00:57:34,790 --> 00:57:36,208
Can you imagine?

1039
00:57:37,417 --> 00:57:38,669
Champagne!

1040
00:58:03,819 --> 00:58:06,363
<i>"We don't write poems to be happy.</i>

1041
00:58:06,446 --> 00:58:08,365
"We write to discover meaning.

1042
00:58:08,448 --> 00:58:12,369
"We write to revenge
loss and explicate love...

1043
00:58:12,452 --> 00:58:14,246
"to miss nothing in the profound
hope that upon our deaths...

1044
00:58:16,623 --> 00:58:17,916
"we continue...

1045
00:58:21,628 --> 00:58:24,923
"to live in the words."

1046
00:58:32,848 --> 00:58:34,349
Christian.

1047
00:58:36,018 --> 00:58:37,185
Hello.

1048
00:58:38,270 --> 00:58:40,063
How did you know I was here?

1049
00:58:40,147 --> 00:58:44,443
Which is not to say that I flatter
myself by thinking you are here to see me.

1050
00:58:44,526 --> 00:58:45,777
I heard about this...

1051
00:58:45,861 --> 00:58:47,029
Women's-only salon?

1052
00:58:49,197 --> 00:58:51,199
Yes. From a friend.

1053
00:58:52,117 --> 00:58:53,243
Is she here?

1054
00:58:53,327 --> 00:58:54,453
No, she's a man.

1055
00:58:54,536 --> 00:58:55,954
I mean, he is.

1056
00:58:59,207 --> 00:59:01,126
Will you come with me?

1057
00:59:01,209 --> 00:59:02,711
So we can talk?

1058
00:59:05,130 --> 00:59:06,381
Of course.

1059
00:59:13,388 --> 00:59:14,723
Isn't it beautiful?

1060
00:59:19,394 --> 00:59:21,313
Do you suffer from vertigo?

1061
00:59:21,396 --> 00:59:23,232
No. But I don't like heights.

1062
00:59:44,586 --> 00:59:48,006
There are some silences
that are comfortable...

1063
00:59:48,090 --> 00:59:51,677
and then there are some that
are freighted with tension.

1064
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:54,346
What do you think the
nature of this one is?

1065
00:59:57,975 --> 01:00:01,520
I think it's a bit of both.

1066
01:00:02,437 --> 01:00:03,522
I agree.

1067
01:00:10,279 --> 01:00:11,446
Talk to me.

1068
01:00:13,615 --> 01:00:14,700
I love you.

1069
01:00:14,783 --> 01:00:15,826
Yes.

1070
01:00:17,828 --> 01:00:24,918
Sometimes raw, simple words are the
most potent deployment of language.

1071
01:00:25,002 --> 01:00:26,086
I love you.

1072
01:00:26,169 --> 01:00:28,964
The sheer surprise of repetition.

1073
01:00:29,715 --> 01:00:31,633
But say some more.

1074
01:00:31,717 --> 01:00:32,843
What else?

1075
01:00:34,303 --> 01:00:36,305
I love you so much.

1076
01:00:40,017 --> 01:00:42,769
When you write, you say it in
a thousand different ways...

1077
01:00:42,853 --> 01:00:48,400
without ever resorting to those
three overused little words.

1078
01:00:48,483 --> 01:00:50,235
Which little words?

1079
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:54,239
Please, my dearest Christian...

1080
01:00:54,323 --> 01:00:57,826
speak to me like you do in your letters.

1081
01:01:01,747 --> 01:01:05,417
You are an angel to be adored.

1082
01:01:06,752 --> 01:01:10,005
My love is so, so big...

1083
01:01:12,382 --> 01:01:14,259
it is absord.

1084
01:01:14,343 --> 01:01:16,136
I'm sorry?

1085
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:18,180
You are a beautiful flower.

1086
01:01:19,681 --> 01:01:21,225
May I smell your neck?

1087
01:01:22,351 --> 01:01:26,521
Or give it a peck at this violet hour?

1088
01:01:26,605 --> 01:01:29,107
Neuvillette, sir.

1089
01:01:29,191 --> 01:01:30,275
Don't go! Please wait.

1090
01:01:30,359 --> 01:01:31,610
My passion has rendered me...

1091
01:01:31,693 --> 01:01:32,903
- What is it?
- Stupid?

1092
01:01:32,986 --> 01:01:34,154
No, but it does begin with an "S."

1093
01:01:34,238 --> 01:01:36,073
Let me know when you've found it.

1094
01:01:36,990 --> 01:01:39,243
And I am not a flower.

1095
01:01:39,868 --> 01:01:40,994
I need more.

1096
01:01:41,078 --> 01:01:42,454
I need more.

1097
01:01:42,537 --> 01:01:43,705
I need more.

1098
01:01:49,544 --> 01:01:53,465
<i>I need more</i>

1099
01:01:53,548 --> 01:01:55,592
<i>- I need more
- I need more</i>

1100
01:01:55,676 --> 01:02:00,472
<i>Don't you dare tell me you love me</i>

1101
01:02:00,556 --> 01:02:04,393
<i>I've heard that line before</i>

1102
01:02:05,644 --> 01:02:06,812
Speechless!

1103
01:02:06,895 --> 01:02:08,397
That's the word.

1104
01:02:16,238 --> 01:02:17,489
That went well.

1105
01:02:17,573 --> 01:02:18,949
You spied on us?

1106
01:02:20,242 --> 01:02:22,035
I couldn't resist.

1107
01:02:22,911 --> 01:02:24,037
Help me.

1108
01:02:24,121 --> 01:02:25,664
Please.

1109
01:02:25,747 --> 01:02:27,291
No.

1110
01:02:28,125 --> 01:02:31,211
You don't need me.

1111
01:02:31,295 --> 01:02:35,048
<i>Talk of the blank
space behind the sun</i>

1112
01:02:35,132 --> 01:02:36,508
<i>Where you told me you'd
meet me when everyone's gone</i>

1113
01:02:39,136 --> 01:02:42,014
<i>Tell me that nothing makes sense</i>

1114
01:02:42,097 --> 01:02:44,850
<i>But the sound of my
voice in your head</i>

1115
01:02:44,933 --> 01:02:48,061
<i>Even when I'm nowhere around</i>

1116
01:02:48,145 --> 01:02:52,524
<i>Make love make sense
in the loveliest way</i>

1117
01:02:52,608 --> 01:02:56,528
<i>Infinite and simple
in an ink black sky</i>

1118
01:02:56,612 --> 01:03:00,532
<i>Turn me to water
like your letters do</i>

1119
01:03:00,616 --> 01:03:04,703
<i>Make me not know
whether to laugh or cry</i>

1120
01:03:04,786 --> 01:03:08,832
<i>I need more</i>

1121
01:03:08,916 --> 01:03:10,792
<i>I need more</i>

1122
01:03:10,876 --> 01:03:15,714
<i>I need waves of
desire to come over me</i>

1123
01:03:15,797 --> 01:03:19,885
<i>And teardrops on the floor</i>

1124
01:03:19,968 --> 01:03:24,890
<i>I feel like I've been too
long with my thoughts anyway</i>

1125
01:03:24,973 --> 01:03:28,727
<i>I've cornered myself
in the loneliest place</i>

1126
01:03:28,810 --> 01:03:33,065
<i>I won't let you lose me
now that you've found me</i>

1127
01:03:33,148 --> 01:03:37,069
<i>You know what to say so
just say it now to me</i>

1128
01:03:37,152 --> 01:03:40,906
<i>I float through the
hours with everyone else</i>

1129
01:03:40,989 --> 01:03:45,202
<i>But I always only
think of you by myself</i>

1130
01:03:45,285 --> 01:03:48,038
<i>Tell me your secrets
Who are you in private?</i>

1131
01:03:48,121 --> 01:03:49,581
Oh.

1132
01:03:49,665 --> 01:03:53,669
<i>When you can't sleep tell
me how you survive it</i>

1133
01:03:53,752 --> 01:03:57,631
<i>I need more</i>

1134
01:03:57,714 --> 01:03:59,633
<i>I need more</i>

1135
01:03:59,716 --> 01:04:04,638
<i>I need waves of
desire to come over me</i>

1136
01:04:04,721 --> 01:04:07,849
<i>And teardrops on the floor</i>

1137
01:04:07,933 --> 01:04:09,226
Help me. I beg you.

1138
01:04:09,309 --> 01:04:10,894
If I don't win her back, I'll die.

1139
01:04:10,978 --> 01:04:13,146
Then you'd better improve
your regurgitation skills.

1140
01:04:13,230 --> 01:04:15,607
All right, I need you.

1141
01:04:15,691 --> 01:04:18,026
I was an idiot to believe
I didn't. I apologize.

1142
01:04:18,110 --> 01:04:19,778
- You need me?
- Always.

1143
01:04:19,861 --> 01:04:21,697
- Am I essential?
- Of course.

1144
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:23,615
Will you say my words without
pedantry, prevarication, or quibbling?

1145
01:04:27,578 --> 01:04:28,662
Just say yes.

1146
01:04:28,745 --> 01:04:29,871
Yes.

1147
01:04:29,955 --> 01:04:31,415
Good. Follow me.

1148
01:04:32,374 --> 01:04:36,461
<i>I need more</i>

1149
01:04:36,545 --> 01:04:38,171
<i>I need more</i>

1150
01:04:38,255 --> 01:04:43,468
<i>Don't you dare tell me you love me</i>

1151
01:04:43,552 --> 01:04:47,347
<i>I've heard that line before</i>

1152
01:04:47,431 --> 01:04:50,893
<i>I've heard that line before</i>

1153
01:04:50,976 --> 01:04:53,645
<i>I need more</i>

1154
01:04:53,729 --> 01:04:55,063
Right. Now, you stand there.

1155
01:04:55,772 --> 01:04:57,399
And I will be here.

1156
01:04:57,482 --> 01:04:59,526
And when she returns, I will
whisper what you must say to her.

1157
01:04:59,610 --> 01:05:01,194
No.

1158
01:05:01,278 --> 01:05:03,530
Yes. I will feed you the words.

1159
01:05:03,614 --> 01:05:05,574
It's madness! How can it possibly work?

1160
01:05:08,410 --> 01:05:10,579
Do not ruin this again.

1161
01:05:24,468 --> 01:05:25,844
Roxanne.

1162
01:05:25,928 --> 01:05:27,429
Roxanne.

1163
01:05:32,768 --> 01:05:33,936
Who's there?

1164
01:05:34,019 --> 01:05:35,562
Speechless Christian.

1165
01:05:35,646 --> 01:05:37,314
I must talk to you.

1166
01:05:37,397 --> 01:05:39,691
I'd rather read your letters.

1167
01:05:39,775 --> 01:05:41,360
Please.

1168
01:05:41,443 --> 01:05:44,238
Do you regret what happened this evening?

1169
01:05:44,321 --> 01:05:45,781
Yes.

1170
01:05:46,114 --> 01:05:47,324
Yes?

1171
01:05:49,284 --> 01:05:52,037
That's your considered
explanation and apology?

1172
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:54,539
I'm beginning to fear you're
just a weird young man...

1173
01:05:54,623 --> 01:05:56,875
who likes writing letters.

1174
01:05:56,959 --> 01:05:58,502
Maybe you don't even love me.

1175
01:05:59,503 --> 01:06:00,963
Good night.

1176
01:06:02,214 --> 01:06:03,257
Wait.

1177
01:06:05,842 --> 01:06:07,427
I could no more stop loving you...

1178
01:06:07,511 --> 01:06:09,555
I could no more stop loving you...

1179
01:06:09,638 --> 01:06:11,348
...than I could stop the sun rising.

1180
01:06:11,431 --> 01:06:13,225
...than I can stop the sun rising.

1181
01:06:13,809 --> 01:06:16,144
Really?

1182
01:06:16,228 --> 01:06:19,898
My cruel love has never
stopped growing in my soul...

1183
01:06:19,982 --> 01:06:21,733
From the day it was born there.

1184
01:06:21,817 --> 01:06:23,151
...from the day it was born.

1185
01:06:24,278 --> 01:06:25,862
- There.
- There.

1186
01:06:27,155 --> 01:06:30,576
If your love is cruel,
you should have killed it.

1187
01:06:30,659 --> 01:06:32,327
I tried.

1188
01:06:32,411 --> 01:06:35,789
- It has the strength of Hercules.
- I tried. It has the strength of...

1189
01:06:35,872 --> 01:06:36,999
Hercules.

1190
01:06:37,082 --> 01:06:38,584
...Hercules.

1191
01:06:38,667 --> 01:06:39,710
Got anything better?

1192
01:06:41,086 --> 01:06:44,423
Do continue. Please.

1193
01:06:44,506 --> 01:06:47,092
Roxanne, my love for you is so powerful...

1194
01:06:47,175 --> 01:06:50,762
Roxanne, my love for you is so powerful...

1195
01:06:50,846 --> 01:06:52,431
...it has strangled the two serpents...

1196
01:06:52,514 --> 01:06:54,641
...it has strangled the two serpents...

1197
01:06:55,684 --> 01:06:57,019
pride and doubt.

1198
01:06:59,688 --> 01:07:01,189
Why do you speak so haltingly?

1199
01:07:02,733 --> 01:07:03,942
This is impossible.

1200
01:07:04,026 --> 01:07:05,402
No, it's working, keep going.

1201
01:07:05,485 --> 01:07:07,362
Are you going to answer my question?

1202
01:07:11,283 --> 01:07:13,368
My speech seems halting...

1203
01:07:13,452 --> 01:07:18,123
because in this darkness my
words must stumble to your ear.

1204
01:07:18,206 --> 01:07:19,458
What are you doing?

1205
01:07:19,541 --> 01:07:21,793
My words have no such difficulty.

1206
01:07:21,877 --> 01:07:23,962
Your words fall, mine must climb.

1207
01:07:24,046 --> 01:07:27,132
Then perhaps I should come down to you.

1208
01:07:27,215 --> 01:07:28,300
- No.
- No.

1209
01:07:30,594 --> 01:07:32,804
Why not?

1210
01:07:32,888 --> 01:07:35,432
I like this way of talking.

1211
01:07:35,515 --> 01:07:37,684
I like being invisible to each other.

1212
01:07:39,353 --> 01:07:43,523
I cannot be stunned into
silence by your beauty.

1213
01:07:43,607 --> 01:07:48,237
Here in this awkwardness, I am
free at last to speak from my heart.

1214
01:07:49,238 --> 01:07:51,323
Why is your voice an octave lower?

1215
01:07:55,410 --> 01:07:57,329
I'm daring to be myself.

1216
01:08:00,123 --> 01:08:03,126
Why would you fear to be yourself?

1217
01:08:04,086 --> 01:08:05,087
To be laughed at.

1218
01:08:05,712 --> 01:08:06,964
For what?

1219
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:11,885
For having too much emotion.

1220
01:08:11,969 --> 01:08:12,970
I do not look...

1221
01:08:14,263 --> 01:08:16,139
Speak as I feel.

1222
01:08:17,599 --> 01:08:19,601
<i>The way I feel is like</i>

1223
01:08:21,603 --> 01:08:24,898
<i>Falling stars</i>

1224
01:08:24,982 --> 01:08:31,196
<i>Diving into cold ocean waves</i>

1225
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:37,536
<i>Words can only get me so far</i>

1226
01:08:37,619 --> 01:08:40,664
<i>But they cannot describe</i>

1227
01:08:40,747 --> 01:08:43,208
<i>The way that it hurts</i>

1228
01:08:44,293 --> 01:08:48,505
<i>'Cause every time I see you</i>

1229
01:08:48,589 --> 01:08:53,719
<i>I am overcome</i>

1230
01:08:54,636 --> 01:08:57,222
<i>I try to tell you</i>

1231
01:08:57,306 --> 01:09:00,726
<i>Tell you how much I need you</i>

1232
01:09:03,312 --> 01:09:06,648
<i>But I turn and run</i>

1233
01:09:09,943 --> 01:09:16,074
<i>Your letters to me are like music</i>

1234
01:09:16,158 --> 01:09:22,080
<i>They're just a mask in
a lonely coward's game</i>

1235
01:09:22,164 --> 01:09:28,712
<i>What is it you're
so afraid of losing?</i>

1236
01:09:28,795 --> 01:09:36,094
<i>That I might lose everything
if I lose the pain</i>

1237
01:09:36,178 --> 01:09:40,349
<i>'Cause every time I see you</i>

1238
01:09:40,432 --> 01:09:45,187
<i>I am overcome</i>

1239
01:09:46,688 --> 01:09:50,442
<i>It'd make you laugh to
think someone like me</i>

1240
01:09:50,525 --> 01:09:53,987
<i>Could keep someone like you</i>

1241
01:09:55,697 --> 01:09:58,700
<i>Look what I've become</i>

1242
01:10:01,411 --> 01:10:04,915
<i>You wore your hair down
one time last spring</i>

1243
01:10:04,998 --> 01:10:06,541
<i>In the chapel</i>

1244
01:10:08,001 --> 01:10:10,379
<i>Your lips painted red</i>

1245
01:10:10,462 --> 01:10:13,006
<i>I remember the day</i>

1246
01:10:14,216 --> 01:10:16,009
<i>We hadn't met yet</i>

1247
01:10:16,093 --> 01:10:20,973
<i>How could you possibly
remember that?</i>

1248
01:10:21,056 --> 01:10:22,975
<i>You watched me then</i>

1249
01:10:23,058 --> 01:10:27,938
<i>Why didn't you say something?</i>

1250
01:10:28,021 --> 01:10:32,192
<i>'Cause every time I see you</i>

1251
01:10:32,276 --> 01:10:37,072
<i>I am overcome</i>

1252
01:10:38,490 --> 01:10:41,159
<i>I try to tell you</i>

1253
01:10:41,243 --> 01:10:45,414
<i>Tell you how much I need you, too</i>

1254
01:10:47,749 --> 01:10:50,294
<i>But look what I've become</i>

1255
01:10:52,421 --> 01:10:59,177
<i>Nothing feels real anymore
when you're not around me</i>

1256
01:10:59,261 --> 01:11:03,891
<i>Even the sky looks
like it's behind glass</i>

1257
01:11:05,601 --> 01:11:07,352
<i>Hearing your voice now</i>

1258
01:11:07,436 --> 01:11:11,523
<i>I can see everything clearly</i>

1259
01:11:11,607 --> 01:11:17,696
<i>I can see that you really
are my love at last</i>

1260
01:11:17,779 --> 01:11:22,993
<i>But, oh, Roxanne</i>

1261
01:11:24,286 --> 01:11:26,538
<i>I'm right here, love</i>

1262
01:11:26,622 --> 01:11:29,917
<i>Words fail me</i>

1263
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,961
<i>Please come to me</i>

1264
01:11:33,045 --> 01:11:37,090
<i>I try, but I can't</i>

1265
01:11:37,174 --> 01:11:39,218
<i>This is real love</i>

1266
01:11:39,301 --> 01:11:42,638
<i>Dare to believe you'd have me</i>

1267
01:11:42,721 --> 01:11:46,099
<i>I have no doubt</i>

1268
01:11:46,183 --> 01:11:48,810
<i>I know that you're the one now</i>

1269
01:11:49,728 --> 01:11:52,439
<i>You don't know anything</i>

1270
01:11:52,522 --> 01:11:55,734
<i>I know that it's you</i>

1271
01:11:55,817 --> 01:11:57,319
<i>Roxanne, if this was true</i>

1272
01:11:58,820 --> 01:12:01,865
<i>Just tell me what you need now</i>

1273
01:12:01,949 --> 01:12:05,077
<i>Then I'd need for nothing</i>

1274
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:09,665
<i>Just tell me what to do</i>

1275
01:12:10,999 --> 01:12:12,000
Give me a kiss.

1276
01:12:12,292 --> 01:12:13,293
No!

1277
01:12:14,836 --> 01:12:18,632
Yes, I asked for a
kiss, but I was too bold!

1278
01:12:18,715 --> 01:12:19,758
You don't insist?

1279
01:12:19,841 --> 01:12:20,926
Yes.

1280
01:12:21,009 --> 01:12:22,344
- No.
- Be quiet.

1281
01:12:24,388 --> 01:12:25,847
You were speaking of a kiss.

1282
01:12:28,392 --> 01:12:30,477
Yes, what is a kiss?

1283
01:12:30,561 --> 01:12:33,230
Surely, you know.

1284
01:12:33,313 --> 01:12:34,773
I meant metaphorically.

1285
01:12:35,732 --> 01:12:37,442
Is it a vow, a promise...

1286
01:12:37,526 --> 01:12:38,944
a confession...

1287
01:12:39,027 --> 01:12:40,487
a secret...

1288
01:12:40,571 --> 01:12:42,322
a moment of eternity...

1289
01:12:43,365 --> 01:12:45,951
a communion, a heartbeat?

1290
01:12:46,034 --> 01:12:47,869
No more metaphors.

1291
01:12:47,953 --> 01:12:50,080
Come claim your kiss.

1292
01:12:50,163 --> 01:12:52,124
Literally.

1293
01:13:05,429 --> 01:13:06,430
Go to her.

1294
01:13:12,728 --> 01:13:14,563
It seems wrong now.

1295
01:13:15,439 --> 01:13:16,815
She wants you.

1296
01:14:47,322 --> 01:14:49,741
Which house belongs to Miss Roxanne?

1297
01:14:49,825 --> 01:14:50,909
Who wants to know?

1298
01:14:50,993 --> 01:14:52,619
- I have a letter for her.
- From whom?

1299
01:14:52,703 --> 01:14:55,289
It's confidential and urgent.

1300
01:14:57,332 --> 01:14:59,042
Miss Roxanne...

1301
01:14:59,126 --> 01:15:02,921
the noble Duke de Guiche asked me in
specific, as it is a holy matter...

1302
01:15:03,005 --> 01:15:05,424
to bring that letter directly to you.

1303
01:15:10,846 --> 01:15:16,435
<i>My dearest, I have sent a
holy man to you with a choice.</i>

1304
01:15:16,518 --> 01:15:20,230
<i>You have declared
your love for me...</i>

1305
01:15:20,314 --> 01:15:26,612
<i>and I can no longer wait
to enjoy your treasures.</i>

1306
01:15:26,695 --> 01:15:28,822
<i>I'm on my way to you.</i>

1307
01:15:28,906 --> 01:15:31,825
<i>If you keep the priest
there, I will marry you.</i>

1308
01:15:31,909 --> 01:15:34,786
<i>If you send him away...</i>

1309
01:15:34,870 --> 01:15:39,666
<i>we shall consummate our love
without the bonds of vows.</i>

1310
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:41,835
<i>Your choice.</i>

1311
01:15:41,919 --> 01:15:43,503
<i>Either way...</i>

1312
01:15:43,587 --> 01:15:46,924
<i>I will possess you tonight.</i>

1313
01:16:05,108 --> 01:16:06,401
All well?

1314
01:16:24,086 --> 01:16:27,172
Miss Roxanne, what does it say?

1315
01:16:29,424 --> 01:16:35,514
This letter is delivered into
your hands by a saintly...

1316
01:16:35,597 --> 01:16:38,809
and extremely discreet priest.

1317
01:16:39,893 --> 01:16:41,353
Inform him...

1318
01:16:41,436 --> 01:16:42,521
Roxanne?

1319
01:16:42,604 --> 01:16:46,191
...that it is the Cardinal's will...

1320
01:16:46,275 --> 01:16:50,028
that he give the blessing
of holy matrimony...

1321
01:16:50,112 --> 01:16:53,532
in secret and without delay in your home...

1322
01:16:53,615 --> 01:16:54,992
to you...

1323
01:17:06,003 --> 01:17:07,379
and Christian Neuvillette.

1324
01:17:08,463 --> 01:17:09,881
What?

1325
01:17:09,965 --> 01:17:14,219
I told you it was a holy
matter from a worthy lord.

1326
01:17:14,303 --> 01:17:17,723
- Is this okay with you, my love?
- Nothing could make me happier.

1327
01:17:20,392 --> 01:17:21,476
It says we must hurry.

1328
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:22,644
Roxanne?

1329
01:17:26,315 --> 01:17:27,316
Yes?

1330
01:17:29,776 --> 01:17:32,237
De Guiche is on his way here.

1331
01:17:32,321 --> 01:17:34,323
Then you will delay him.

1332
01:17:39,119 --> 01:17:40,412
Thank you.

1333
01:17:40,495 --> 01:17:42,497
Thank you. I could not be happier.

1334
01:17:48,754 --> 01:17:50,339
You don't know what you're in for.

1335
01:17:55,510 --> 01:17:58,555
<i>I deserve a little kindness</i>

1336
01:17:58,639 --> 01:18:01,600
<i>I deserve my due respect</i>

1337
01:18:01,683 --> 01:18:04,436
<i>I deserve to be beloved</i>

1338
01:18:04,519 --> 01:18:08,941
<i>Just like everybody else</i>

1339
01:18:09,024 --> 01:18:11,735
<i>I deserve my place in heaven</i>

1340
01:18:11,818 --> 01:18:14,905
<i>I deserve an equal share</i>

1341
01:18:14,988 --> 01:18:17,449
<i>I deserve my rightful cut</i>

1342
01:18:17,532 --> 01:18:21,078
<i>Of everything everywhere</i>

1343
01:18:22,537 --> 01:18:24,122
<i>God, Roxanne</i>

1344
01:18:24,206 --> 01:18:27,709
<i>Am I asking for too much?</i>

1345
01:18:27,793 --> 01:18:33,924
<i>Why should I have to beg
for what everybody wants?</i>

1346
01:18:35,050 --> 01:18:36,718
<i>Take me right now</i>

1347
01:18:36,802 --> 01:18:39,179
<i>I don't care if I have your love</i>

1348
01:18:39,263 --> 01:18:41,306
<i>I'll have no fear</i>

1349
01:18:41,390 --> 01:18:43,767
<i>Nothing's even nothing's fair</i>

1350
01:18:43,850 --> 01:18:46,853
<i>Roxanne, I didn't ask to be here</i>

1351
01:18:46,937 --> 01:18:50,148
<i>I'll pick the lock
I'll draw the knife</i>

1352
01:18:50,232 --> 01:18:53,318
<i>I'll climb the wall
I'll crash the gate</i>

1353
01:18:53,402 --> 01:18:56,488
<i>'Cause I deserve a happy life</i>

1354
01:18:56,572 --> 01:19:01,368
<i>Whatever I'm not given I'll take</i>

1355
01:19:01,451 --> 01:19:02,953
"Love is patient.

1356
01:19:03,036 --> 01:19:04,580
- <i>God, Roxanne...</i>
- "Love is kind.

1357
01:19:04,663 --> 01:19:06,248
- <i>...am I asking...</i>
- "It does not envy.

1358
01:19:06,331 --> 01:19:08,333
- <i>...for too much?</i>
- "It does not boast. It is not proud."

1359
01:19:08,417 --> 01:19:14,339
<i>Why should I have to beg
for what everybody wants?</i>

1360
01:19:14,423 --> 01:19:16,967
<i>"It keeps no record of wrongs.</i>

1361
01:19:19,303 --> 01:19:23,140
"In sickness and in health,
until death do you part."

1362
01:19:23,223 --> 01:19:24,850
I do.

1363
01:19:24,933 --> 01:19:26,435
"Roxanne...

1364
01:19:26,518 --> 01:19:29,521
"do you take Christian
for your lawful husband...

1365
01:19:29,605 --> 01:19:32,524
"to have and to hold
from this day forward?"

1366
01:19:35,319 --> 01:19:38,697
<i>I deserve a little kindness</i>

1367
01:19:38,780 --> 01:19:41,241
- <i>I deserve my due respect</i>
- Roxanne...

1368
01:19:41,325 --> 01:19:44,244
- <i>I deserve to be beloved</i>
- ...receive this ring as a sign of my love...

1369
01:19:44,328 --> 01:19:47,623
- <i>Just like everybody else</i>
- ...and fidelity.

1370
01:19:47,706 --> 01:19:50,542
<i>God gave me the life I'm living</i>

1371
01:19:50,626 --> 01:19:54,004
<i>You better make no mistake</i>

1372
01:19:54,087 --> 01:19:56,715
<i>I deserve to be forgiven</i>

1373
01:19:56,798 --> 01:19:59,384
<i>Whatever I'm not given</i>

1374
01:19:59,468 --> 01:20:06,475
<i>I'll take</i>

1375
01:20:13,941 --> 01:20:15,984
Do you know what's happened in there?

1376
01:20:17,319 --> 01:20:18,528
The slut.

1377
01:20:25,118 --> 01:20:27,079
She's married a guard.

1378
01:20:32,834 --> 01:20:35,295
She's insane.

1379
01:20:45,222 --> 01:20:47,683
I'm through with love.

1380
01:20:47,766 --> 01:20:50,018
Does one nothing but harm.

1381
01:20:54,690 --> 01:20:58,318
I'm going back in there.

1382
01:21:00,779 --> 01:21:01,780
Attention.

1383
01:21:02,698 --> 01:21:04,324
You, get out of here.

1384
01:21:04,408 --> 01:21:06,493
You, I don't want to see your face.

1385
01:21:06,577 --> 01:21:08,245
- Neuvillette.
- Sir.

1386
01:21:08,328 --> 01:21:10,872
Your regiment leaves for the war tonight.

1387
01:21:10,956 --> 01:21:17,796
You are to depart for the front at once
and deliver these orders immediately.

1388
01:21:17,879 --> 01:21:20,799
You promised the guards would
not be sent to the front.

1389
01:21:20,882 --> 01:21:21,884
Promises?

1390
01:21:23,135 --> 01:21:24,344
Say goodbye to your husband.

1391
01:21:24,428 --> 01:21:26,263
Do you mean to make me a widow?

1392
01:21:26,346 --> 01:21:28,265
Only God knows.

1393
01:21:30,267 --> 01:21:31,685
Christian.

1394
01:21:31,768 --> 01:21:32,811
Christian.

1395
01:21:32,895 --> 01:21:33,979
Christian.

1396
01:21:39,735 --> 01:21:42,905
Come, Christian. We must go.

1397
01:21:42,988 --> 01:21:46,658
Roxanne, I love you,
and I will return to you.

1398
01:21:53,624 --> 01:21:54,625
Enough.

1399
01:22:04,676 --> 01:22:05,677
Cyrano.

1400
01:22:07,387 --> 01:22:10,474
Promise me he will not be cold or hungry.

1401
01:22:10,557 --> 01:22:12,559
I can't promise that.

1402
01:22:12,643 --> 01:22:14,853
Promise me he will be faithful.

1403
01:22:14,937 --> 01:22:17,314
Of course he will, but
I cannot promise you.

1404
01:22:20,025 --> 01:22:22,236
Promise me...

1405
01:22:22,319 --> 01:22:23,570
he will write.

1406
01:22:28,492 --> 01:22:30,244
That I can promise you.

1407
01:22:58,897 --> 01:23:03,902
<i>How is it I feel you closer to me</i>

1408
01:23:03,986 --> 01:23:08,365
<i>Now that the world's between us?</i>

1409
01:23:08,448 --> 01:23:13,954
<i>What I wouldn't do
just to get some sleep</i>

1410
01:23:14,037 --> 01:23:18,375
<i>- But we're taking fire
- But we're taking fire</i>

1411
01:23:18,458 --> 01:23:24,089
<i>There are some things
that my mind can't do</i>

1412
01:23:24,172 --> 01:23:28,260
<i>- The machine takes over
- The machine takes over</i>

1413
01:23:28,343 --> 01:23:33,807
<i>I'd kill the world to
get back home to you</i>

1414
01:23:33,891 --> 01:23:38,645
<i>- But I'm getting tired
- But I'm getting tired</i>

1415
01:23:38,729 --> 01:23:43,762
<i>If I close my eyes
maybe I'll see you there</i>

1416
01:23:43,859 --> 01:23:46,904
<i>One more time</i>

1417
01:23:48,113 --> 01:23:51,116
<i>And I will give you my word</i>

1418
01:23:51,199 --> 01:23:56,747
<i>I'm so afraid you won't believe it</i>

1419
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:01,668
<i>And if I told you all I've done</i>

1420
01:24:01,752 --> 01:24:06,298
<i>I know it'd make you cry</i>

1421
01:24:07,883 --> 01:24:12,763
<i>So I will close my eyes
And let the falling skies</i>

1422
01:24:12,846 --> 01:24:16,516
<i>- Lay down between us
- Lay down between us</i>

1423
01:24:17,935 --> 01:24:22,522
<i>I will close my eyes And
let the falling skies</i>

1424
01:24:22,606 --> 01:24:26,318
<i>- Lay down between us
- Lay down between us</i>

1425
01:25:14,658 --> 01:25:17,578
Friendly! Friendly coming through.

1426
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:22,833
Cyrano.

1427
01:25:38,015 --> 01:25:40,309
Every morning, they shoot.

1428
01:25:40,392 --> 01:25:43,395
And every morning, they miss.

1429
01:25:43,478 --> 01:25:45,397
And one morning, they'll get lucky.

1430
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:47,774
You're risking your life to send a letter.

1431
01:25:49,192 --> 01:25:51,612
I promised her he would write.

1432
01:25:57,868 --> 01:25:59,786
<i>It's a suicide mission.</i>

1433
01:26:01,246 --> 01:26:05,334
Those orders from the King
command me to decide...

1434
01:26:05,417 --> 01:26:08,253
which of my units must perish.

1435
01:26:09,421 --> 01:26:11,715
<i>Do I send the most expendable?</i>

1436
01:26:11,798 --> 01:26:13,342
Where are you going?

1437
01:26:13,425 --> 01:26:14,968
To write a letter.

1438
01:26:15,510 --> 01:26:17,512
Or the bravest?

1439
01:26:29,608 --> 01:26:30,651
The guards.

1440
01:26:32,527 --> 01:26:33,779
Make out the orders...

1441
01:26:34,905 --> 01:26:38,575
to Captain Le Bret immediately.

1442
01:26:38,659 --> 01:26:40,869
<i>We'll let God decide the rest.</i>

1443
01:26:51,546 --> 01:26:54,424
I take no pleasure in this.

1444
01:26:56,927 --> 01:26:58,845
I serve my King.

1445
01:27:00,013 --> 01:27:01,682
Not my spite.

1446
01:27:03,267 --> 01:27:04,560
Form break.

1447
01:27:04,643 --> 01:27:06,353
- Present arms.
- Platoons! Get ready.

1448
01:27:06,436 --> 01:27:09,731
Platoon commanders, steady your men!

1449
01:27:12,484 --> 01:27:14,236
<i>Form line!</i>

1450
01:27:17,030 --> 01:27:19,324
This child has delivered
our orders from the King.

1451
01:27:23,662 --> 01:27:24,788
These are from de Guiche.

1452
01:27:24,871 --> 01:27:26,832
Correct. In service of the King.

1453
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:30,210
We've been holding this
godforsaken rock for months.

1454
01:27:30,294 --> 01:27:32,004
On the King's orders.

1455
01:27:32,087 --> 01:27:34,965
And now we have the noble distinction
of being chosen to mount an attack.

1456
01:27:36,592 --> 01:27:37,885
De Guiche wants me dead.

1457
01:27:37,968 --> 01:27:39,678
The odds are against us.

1458
01:27:42,764 --> 01:27:45,350
I'd rather die down there fighting...

1459
01:27:45,434 --> 01:27:46,977
than starve up here waiting.

1460
01:27:48,896 --> 01:27:50,230
Then ready yourself.

1461
01:27:55,068 --> 01:27:56,486
Form line!

1462
01:27:59,072 --> 01:28:00,949
Captain, steady your men!

1463
01:28:01,867 --> 01:28:03,952
Collect the letters.

1464
01:28:13,629 --> 01:28:16,006
<i>I have a wife</i>

1465
01:28:16,089 --> 01:28:18,634
<i>I haven't seen</i>

1466
01:28:18,717 --> 01:28:21,929
<i>Since lilacs bloomed
in Saint-Hippolyte</i>

1467
01:28:23,513 --> 01:28:25,349
<i>She always wears them</i>

1468
01:28:26,266 --> 01:28:28,477
<i>In her hair</i>

1469
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:32,564
<i>And she lets them
fall down everywhere</i>

1470
01:28:32,648 --> 01:28:38,028
<i>I can see her in the glowing light</i>

1471
01:28:38,111 --> 01:28:41,448
<i>Dressing without a sound</i>

1472
01:28:42,950 --> 01:28:47,204
<i>I promised I'd be home all right</i>

1473
01:28:47,287 --> 01:28:51,833
<i>But I gotta lay this body down</i>

1474
01:28:53,669 --> 01:28:56,213
<i>So take this letter</i>

1475
01:28:56,296 --> 01:28:58,590
<i>To my wife</i>

1476
01:28:58,674 --> 01:29:01,760
<i>And tell her that I loved my life</i>

1477
01:29:03,762 --> 01:29:05,889
<i>And tell my boys</i>

1478
01:29:05,973 --> 01:29:08,600
<i>The Lord, he found me</i>

1479
01:29:08,684 --> 01:29:10,852
<i>When I say their names out loud</i>

1480
01:29:10,936 --> 01:29:12,854
<i>They're all around me</i>

1481
01:29:12,938 --> 01:29:14,147
<i>And tell 'em</i>

1482
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:20,237
<i>Not to cry at all</i>

1483
01:29:23,323 --> 01:29:26,243
<i>Heaven</i>

1484
01:29:26,326 --> 01:29:30,581
<i>Is wherever I fall</i>

1485
01:29:33,584 --> 01:29:36,086
<i>I have a girl</i>

1486
01:29:36,169 --> 01:29:37,754
<i>I think I love her</i>

1487
01:29:38,797 --> 01:29:40,549
<i>I should have told her</i>

1488
01:29:40,632 --> 01:29:42,551
<i>Instead I told her mother</i>

1489
01:29:43,719 --> 01:29:46,263
<i>I gave her chocolates</i>

1490
01:29:46,346 --> 01:29:47,514
<i>I bought a ring</i>

1491
01:29:48,724 --> 01:29:52,644
<i>But I never told her anything</i>

1492
01:29:52,728 --> 01:29:58,275
<i>But I can see her
in every detail now</i>

1493
01:29:58,358 --> 01:30:01,778
<i>Turning in my mind</i>

1494
01:30:03,196 --> 01:30:07,367
<i>I barely knew that girl at all</i>

1495
01:30:07,451 --> 01:30:10,287
<i>But I will love her
till the end of time</i>

1496
01:30:13,749 --> 01:30:16,293
<i>So take this letter</i>

1497
01:30:16,376 --> 01:30:18,754
<i>To my girl</i>

1498
01:30:18,837 --> 01:30:23,467
<i>Tell her that I saw the whole world</i>

1499
01:30:23,550 --> 01:30:28,138
<i>Say that right before I fell</i>

1500
01:30:28,222 --> 01:30:30,474
<i>I said her name out loud</i>

1501
01:30:31,642 --> 01:30:33,185
<i>Isabelle</i>

1502
01:30:33,268 --> 01:30:35,312
<i>And tell her</i>

1503
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:39,942
<i>Not to cry at all</i>

1504
01:30:43,487 --> 01:30:46,490
<i>Heaven</i>

1505
01:30:46,573 --> 01:30:50,244
<i>Is wherever I fall</i>

1506
01:30:53,789 --> 01:30:55,415
<i>I have a father</i>

1507
01:30:56,333 --> 01:30:57,501
<i>He isn't well</i>

1508
01:30:58,961 --> 01:31:02,422
<i>He thinks he might be going to hell</i>

1509
01:31:03,882 --> 01:31:05,384
<i>He was a sinner</i>

1510
01:31:06,260 --> 01:31:07,678
<i>He liked to fight</i>

1511
01:31:09,054 --> 01:31:12,808
<i>So I don't know he might be right</i>

1512
01:31:12,891 --> 01:31:18,188
<i>I can see him every Sunday morning</i>

1513
01:31:18,272 --> 01:31:21,817
<i>Diving into the fray</i>

1514
01:31:23,235 --> 01:31:27,990
<i>He wasn't one of God's best men</i>

1515
01:31:28,073 --> 01:31:32,160
<i>But I loved him anyway</i>

1516
01:31:33,870 --> 01:31:35,289
<i>So take this letter</i>

1517
01:31:36,623 --> 01:31:39,084
<i>To him, please</i>

1518
01:31:39,167 --> 01:31:42,629
<i>And tell him I can't wait to see him</i>

1519
01:31:43,922 --> 01:31:45,299
<i>I went in first</i>

1520
01:31:46,425 --> 01:31:48,927
<i>I rang the bell</i>

1521
01:31:49,011 --> 01:31:52,723
<i>I called his name out
loud and I gave 'em hell</i>

1522
01:31:52,806 --> 01:31:54,474
<i>So tell him</i>

1523
01:31:56,643 --> 01:32:00,314
<i>Not to cry at all</i>

1524
01:32:03,567 --> 01:32:06,570
<i>Heaven</i>

1525
01:32:06,653 --> 01:32:10,115
<i>Is wherever I fall</i>

1526
01:32:13,368 --> 01:32:14,369
<i>Tell 'em</i>

1527
01:32:16,496 --> 01:32:20,751
<i>Not to cry at all</i>

1528
01:32:23,462 --> 01:32:26,423
<i>Heaven</i>

1529
01:32:26,506 --> 01:32:30,385
<i>Is wherever I fall</i>

1530
01:32:33,222 --> 01:32:34,306
<i>Tell 'em</i>

1531
01:32:34,389 --> 01:32:35,515
Roxanne.

1532
01:32:36,516 --> 01:32:39,311
- <i>Not to cry at all</i>
- I know.

1533
01:32:39,394 --> 01:32:41,396
I wish I could write her one last letter.

1534
01:32:43,315 --> 01:32:45,609
- You have.
- <i>Heaven</i>

1535
01:32:45,692 --> 01:32:46,777
Let me see.

1536
01:32:46,860 --> 01:32:48,445
<i>Is wherever I fall</i>

1537
01:32:48,528 --> 01:32:50,155
No need.

1538
01:32:50,239 --> 01:32:51,782
Of course there's a need.

1539
01:33:08,715 --> 01:33:10,175
What's this?

1540
01:33:10,259 --> 01:33:11,510
What?

1541
01:33:11,593 --> 01:33:13,262
This.

1542
01:33:13,345 --> 01:33:14,471
It's a tear stain.

1543
01:33:14,555 --> 01:33:16,181
Is it? That's odd.

1544
01:33:19,268 --> 01:33:23,063
We poets sometimes are so moved
by our own creations that we...

1545
01:33:23,146 --> 01:33:24,189
It's poetic empathy.

1546
01:33:25,566 --> 01:33:27,359
You cried writing this letter?

1547
01:33:29,987 --> 01:33:32,990
Yes. I cannot bear not to see her again.

1548
01:33:35,534 --> 01:33:37,119
We will never see her again.

1549
01:33:37,202 --> 01:33:41,206
You, her beloved husband, might
die and never see her again.

1550
01:33:41,290 --> 01:33:42,583
That is the tear stain.

1551
01:33:44,751 --> 01:33:46,044
You're in love with her.

1552
01:33:46,128 --> 01:33:47,129
What?

1553
01:33:48,380 --> 01:33:50,465
You've gone mad. You're starving.

1554
01:33:50,549 --> 01:33:52,092
Deny it then.

1555
01:33:53,468 --> 01:33:54,636
Do you love her?

1556
01:33:59,099 --> 01:34:00,475
It's too simple.

1557
01:34:03,854 --> 01:34:05,105
I knew it.

1558
01:34:06,481 --> 01:34:08,483
But I didn't...

1559
01:34:08,567 --> 01:34:10,569
I didn't dare let myself believe it.

1560
01:34:11,612 --> 01:34:12,779
I feel sick.

1561
01:34:12,863 --> 01:34:14,698
- You've always loved her.
- I will deny it.

1562
01:34:14,781 --> 01:34:16,408
You can't deny it. You can't even hide it.

1563
01:34:16,491 --> 01:34:18,118
Christian, listen to me.

1564
01:34:18,201 --> 01:34:20,120
If I should die and you should
live, and she mentions the letters...

1565
01:34:20,203 --> 01:34:21,872
- do not be surprised...
- At what?

1566
01:34:21,955 --> 01:34:23,707
If she mentions their volume.

1567
01:34:23,790 --> 01:34:25,709
You've written to her
more often than you know.

1568
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:27,794
- How often?
- Often enough.

1569
01:34:27,878 --> 01:34:29,504
- Twice a week?
- More.

1570
01:34:29,588 --> 01:34:31,256
- Three times a week?
- More than that.

1571
01:34:31,340 --> 01:34:33,091
- Four? Five?
- More.

1572
01:34:33,175 --> 01:34:34,635
- Every day?
- Yes, every day.

1573
01:35:03,538 --> 01:35:05,332
She doesn't love me.

1574
01:35:05,415 --> 01:35:07,751
Of course she does.

1575
01:35:07,834 --> 01:35:10,754
In her most recent letter,
she said she loves me...

1576
01:35:10,837 --> 01:35:12,172
because of my soul.

1577
01:35:13,090 --> 01:35:14,591
What could be more loving?

1578
01:35:14,675 --> 01:35:16,218
You are my soul!

1579
01:35:21,932 --> 01:35:23,308
We have to tell her the truth...

1580
01:35:24,476 --> 01:35:26,645
and you must confess your love.

1581
01:35:26,728 --> 01:35:28,939
The world will never accept a midget...

1582
01:35:29,022 --> 01:35:30,941
and a tall beautiful woman.

1583
01:35:31,024 --> 01:35:33,485
Never mind the world. What about Roxanne?

1584
01:35:34,945 --> 01:35:37,656
She's got a huge heart.

1585
01:35:37,739 --> 01:35:41,660
In the same letter, she reassured
me that she'd still love me...

1586
01:35:41,743 --> 01:35:44,955
even if I return from
this hell a broken man...

1587
01:35:45,038 --> 01:35:47,165
disfigured and body destroyed.

1588
01:35:47,249 --> 01:35:48,500
She said that?

1589
01:36:05,475 --> 01:36:06,518
Don't believe her.

1590
01:36:06,602 --> 01:36:07,853
Don't doubt her.

1591
01:36:09,313 --> 01:36:11,523
Take your positions!

1592
01:36:14,151 --> 01:36:15,360
We have betrayed her.

1593
01:36:15,444 --> 01:36:17,154
We can never tell her.
It'll break her heart.

1594
01:36:17,237 --> 01:36:18,530
We have to tell her.

1595
01:36:18,614 --> 01:36:20,365
It's our moral...

1596
01:36:20,449 --> 01:36:21,617
Our moral...

1597
01:36:22,910 --> 01:36:24,536
Obligation.

1598
01:36:24,620 --> 01:36:25,704
See you on the other side!

1599
01:36:25,787 --> 01:36:27,706
We must let her decide our fate.

1600
01:36:27,789 --> 01:36:30,626
One of us, none of us...

1601
01:36:30,709 --> 01:36:32,544
She must have the choice.

1602
01:36:32,628 --> 01:36:34,254
Form the line!

1603
01:36:36,465 --> 01:36:39,176
And I'm certain she'll choose you.

1604
01:36:39,259 --> 01:36:40,636
She's already chosen you.

1605
01:36:40,719 --> 01:36:42,471
Love at first sight. She married you.

1606
01:36:42,554 --> 01:36:44,181
She doesn't love me.
She doesn't even know me.

1607
01:36:44,264 --> 01:36:45,641
She doesn't love me either.

1608
01:36:45,724 --> 01:36:47,643
I think she does.

1609
01:36:47,726 --> 01:36:50,646
And I would prefer to be loved
for my true self or not at all.

1610
01:36:52,648 --> 01:36:54,107
Get ready!

1611
01:36:54,900 --> 01:36:56,026
Christian.

1612
01:36:56,109 --> 01:36:57,819
Attention!

1613
01:36:57,903 --> 01:36:59,196
<i>Tell 'em</i>

1614
01:36:59,279 --> 01:37:01,031
See you on the other side!

1615
01:37:01,114 --> 01:37:04,993
<i>Not to cry at all</i>

1616
01:37:08,205 --> 01:37:10,290
<i>Heaven</i>

1617
01:37:11,124 --> 01:37:15,462
<i>Is wherever I fall</i>

1618
01:37:15,545 --> 01:37:18,006
Soldier, back in line!

1619
01:37:18,090 --> 01:37:19,591
<i>Tell 'em</i>

1620
01:37:19,675 --> 01:37:21,051
Soldier!

1621
01:37:21,134 --> 01:37:25,556
- <i>Not to cry at all</i>
- Christian! No!

1622
01:37:28,141 --> 01:37:30,769
<i>Heaven</i>

1623
01:37:30,852 --> 01:37:35,774
<i>Is wherever I fall</i>

1624
01:38:08,515 --> 01:38:09,975
You will live.

1625
01:38:11,977 --> 01:38:16,607
You will live for Roxanne who loves you.

1626
01:38:20,986 --> 01:38:23,530
Tell her everything.

1627
01:38:23,614 --> 01:38:24,615
Please.

1628
01:38:26,617 --> 01:38:27,826
Everything.

1629
01:38:32,748 --> 01:38:34,249
Roxanne.

1630
01:38:39,463 --> 01:38:40,839
Forward!

1631
01:38:40,923 --> 01:38:44,468
Forward! Forward! Forward!

1632
01:38:51,016 --> 01:38:52,226
<i>Tell 'em</i>

1633
01:38:54,102 --> 01:38:58,315
<i>Not to cry at all</i>

1634
01:39:01,109 --> 01:39:04,238
<i>Heaven</i>

1635
01:39:04,321 --> 01:39:08,575
<i>Is wherever I fall</i>

1636
01:39:10,661 --> 01:39:12,037
<i>Tell 'em</i>

1637
01:39:13,872 --> 01:39:18,126
<i>Not to cry at all</i>

1638
01:39:19,294 --> 01:39:23,757
- Make ready! And fire!
- <i>Heaven</i>

1639
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:27,886
<i>Is wherever I fall</i>

1640
01:39:30,055 --> 01:39:31,390
- Fire!
- <i>Tell 'em</i>

1641
01:39:33,517 --> 01:39:37,729
<i>Not to cry at all</i>

1642
01:39:37,813 --> 01:39:39,064
Fire!

1643
01:39:40,315 --> 01:39:43,443
<i>Heaven</i>

1644
01:39:43,527 --> 01:39:48,448
<i>Is wherever I fall</i>

1645
01:39:56,081 --> 01:40:00,919
Sister Claire, must I remind you, you
have accepted a life without mirrors?

1646
01:40:01,003 --> 01:40:02,588
Stop admiring yourself...

1647
01:40:02,671 --> 01:40:04,423
or I will be forced to tell Cyrano.

1648
01:40:04,506 --> 01:40:06,717
Oh, no. He'll make such fun of me.

1649
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:10,429
And promise me you will
stop trying to convert him.

1650
01:40:10,512 --> 01:40:13,724
He's been coming here every Saturday
for as long as I can remember.

1651
01:40:14,558 --> 01:40:16,476
Why does he not believe?

1652
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:18,437
Miss Roxanne is his faith.

1653
01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:21,023
His weekly visits are his service.

1654
01:40:21,106 --> 01:40:23,442
It saddens me he won't see heaven.

1655
01:40:23,525 --> 01:40:26,111
I'm sure the Lord has a plan for him.

1656
01:40:26,194 --> 01:40:28,822
You should worry about his
remaining time on Earth.

1657
01:40:28,906 --> 01:40:30,616
Get him to eat.

1658
01:40:30,699 --> 01:40:32,951
He always says he's not hungry.

1659
01:40:33,035 --> 01:40:35,203
He says, "I ate good meat yesterday."

1660
01:40:35,287 --> 01:40:37,039
It's not true.

1661
01:40:37,122 --> 01:40:39,666
He's too proud to admit he can't afford it.

1662
01:40:39,750 --> 01:40:41,293
He's starving.

1663
01:40:41,376 --> 01:40:43,295
Insist he eats with us this evening.

1664
01:40:43,378 --> 01:40:44,796
Yes, Mother.

1665
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:46,924
He'll be here at six o'clock
to bring her the news.

1666
01:40:50,761 --> 01:40:51,803
<i>Dear Roxanne...</i>

1667
01:40:51,887 --> 01:40:53,680
<i>Dear Roxanne.</i>

1668
01:40:53,764 --> 01:40:56,141
<i>...how many times have I sat by
your side and wanted to tell you?</i>

1669
01:40:56,225 --> 01:40:57,267
<i>Dear Roxanne.</i>

1670
01:40:57,351 --> 01:40:58,352
<i>Almost told you?</i>

1671
01:40:58,435 --> 01:40:59,603
<i>Dear Roxanne.</i>

1672
01:40:59,686 --> 01:41:01,313
<i>There is nothing so
dangerous and sweet...</i>

1673
01:41:01,396 --> 01:41:03,065
<i>to keep as a secret like this.</i>

1674
01:41:03,148 --> 01:41:05,234
<i>I have sublimated.</i>

1675
01:41:05,317 --> 01:41:06,860
<i>Tell her. Tell her.</i>

1676
01:41:06,944 --> 01:41:08,487
<i>How many letters have I written...</i>

1677
01:41:08,570 --> 01:41:09,613
<i>Tell her.</i>

1678
01:41:09,696 --> 01:41:10,697
<i>Trying to spell it out plainly.</i>

1679
01:41:10,781 --> 01:41:11,865
Plainly.

1680
01:41:11,949 --> 01:41:13,158
<i>Simply.</i>

1681
01:41:14,076 --> 01:41:15,118
Simply.

1682
01:41:17,704 --> 01:41:19,164
Without art.

1683
01:41:22,084 --> 01:41:23,085
Ob...

1684
01:41:42,437 --> 01:41:44,106
<i>Tell her the truth.</i>

1685
01:41:44,189 --> 01:41:46,358
<i>You. Always you.</i>

1686
01:41:46,441 --> 01:41:47,693
<i>You. You.</i>

1687
01:41:47,776 --> 01:41:49,695
<i>I love you. I've always loved you.</i>

1688
01:41:49,778 --> 01:41:51,655
<i>Tell her. Tell her.</i>

1689
01:41:51,738 --> 01:41:54,449
<i>I will die loving you,
and you will never know.</i>

1690
01:41:54,533 --> 01:41:55,951
<i>Tell her.</i>

1691
01:42:41,872 --> 01:42:43,498
He'll be here.

1692
01:42:43,582 --> 01:42:45,584
He's always on time.

1693
01:42:48,670 --> 01:42:50,380
Going somewhere?

1694
01:42:53,008 --> 01:42:54,092
You're late.

1695
01:42:54,176 --> 01:42:55,677
I was delayed.

1696
01:42:56,678 --> 01:42:57,763
By what?

1697
01:42:57,846 --> 01:42:59,389
An untimely visitor.

1698
01:43:03,602 --> 01:43:05,062
You sent him away?

1699
01:43:07,356 --> 01:43:11,985
I fear I only put him
off for a short while.

1700
01:43:12,069 --> 01:43:14,112
Well, he will have to wait...

1701
01:43:14,196 --> 01:43:17,741
because I will not let
you leave before nightfall.

1702
01:43:17,824 --> 01:43:19,076
You've cut yourself.

1703
01:43:20,535 --> 01:43:22,871
A scratch, really.

1704
01:43:25,791 --> 01:43:27,960
Aren't you going to tease Sister Claire?

1705
01:43:28,043 --> 01:43:30,170
She waits for it all week, you know.

1706
01:43:32,089 --> 01:43:34,174
Sister Claire, you have such lovely eyes.

1707
01:43:34,258 --> 01:43:36,009
Why do you keep them cast down?

1708
01:43:37,177 --> 01:43:39,263
I ate good meat yesterday.

1709
01:43:40,639 --> 01:43:42,724
When you're ready, come to the dining hall.

1710
01:43:42,808 --> 01:43:44,393
Then I'll give you a big bowl of soup.

1711
01:43:44,476 --> 01:43:46,019
- Yes.
- Good.

1712
01:43:46,103 --> 01:43:48,730
I think Sister Claire
is trying to convert you.

1713
01:43:48,814 --> 01:43:49,815
I am not.

1714
01:43:50,482 --> 01:43:51,817
Mother warned me off.

1715
01:43:55,070 --> 01:43:56,071
Sister Claire.

1716
01:43:57,656 --> 01:44:00,409
Tonight, I will let you pray for me.

1717
01:44:02,578 --> 01:44:04,871
I have not waited for your permission.

1718
01:44:16,758 --> 01:44:18,927
Do you remember the day we first met?

1719
01:44:22,431 --> 01:44:23,515
Yes.

1720
01:44:25,601 --> 01:44:27,895
It was early morning in early June.

1721
01:44:29,313 --> 01:44:32,024
I'd come to borrow a book from your father.

1722
01:44:32,107 --> 01:44:37,529
We found you curled up on the floor
in the library in the dawn light...

1723
01:44:37,613 --> 01:44:40,699
a tome for a pillow.

1724
01:44:40,782 --> 01:44:43,702
You were reading the very
book that I'd come for.

1725
01:44:45,120 --> 01:44:46,413
I refused to give it up.

1726
01:44:48,290 --> 01:44:50,417
Your youth made it forgivable.

1727
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:52,169
I hadn't finished reading it.

1728
01:44:52,252 --> 01:44:53,879
I didn't mind.

1729
01:44:53,962 --> 01:44:55,797
You said you'd give it to me when you had.

1730
01:44:55,881 --> 01:44:57,132
And I did.

1731
01:44:59,801 --> 01:45:02,346
It was as if we'd always known each other.

1732
01:45:04,139 --> 01:45:05,807
And now we have.

1733
01:45:09,436 --> 01:45:13,398
They say light is the soul of a holy space.

1734
01:45:13,482 --> 01:45:15,359
It's designed to be enough.

1735
01:45:17,653 --> 01:45:19,154
Enough beauty...

1736
01:45:22,824 --> 01:45:24,534
to just let go.

1737
01:45:29,998 --> 01:45:31,458
Are you melancholy?

1738
01:45:33,085 --> 01:45:34,127
No.

1739
01:45:34,211 --> 01:45:35,379
No.

1740
01:45:43,011 --> 01:45:44,763
Do you have my daily paper?

1741
01:45:44,846 --> 01:45:46,139
Yes, I do.

1742
01:45:46,223 --> 01:45:47,349
Good.

1743
01:45:50,394 --> 01:45:53,438
Last Saturday, the 19th, I saw you.

1744
01:45:53,522 --> 01:45:55,857
And then a week passed in which
nothing important happened...

1745
01:45:55,941 --> 01:45:57,025
and now here I am again.

1746
01:45:57,109 --> 01:45:58,860
- Cyrano.
- All right.

1747
01:45:59,778 --> 01:46:01,363
The news.

1748
01:46:11,623 --> 01:46:15,335
On Saturday, the head of
state ate too many prunes...

1749
01:46:15,419 --> 01:46:17,629
and he took to his bed with a fever.

1750
01:46:17,713 --> 01:46:20,132
He was executed by his physician...

1751
01:46:20,215 --> 01:46:22,134
and now he is feeling much better.

1752
01:46:25,053 --> 01:46:27,431
There was a ball on Sunday...

1753
01:46:27,514 --> 01:46:32,436
and 762 wax candles were burned...

1754
01:46:34,771 --> 01:46:35,772
out.

1755
01:46:38,817 --> 01:46:43,530
On Monday, our troops were
reported to have beaten everyone...

1756
01:46:43,614 --> 01:46:44,907
everywhere.

1757
01:46:47,200 --> 01:46:52,748
On Tuesday, a tiny little dog had
to be given a very large enema.

1758
01:47:00,631 --> 01:47:02,257
On Wednesday, nothing.

1759
01:47:04,259 --> 01:47:07,012
On Thursday...

1760
01:47:07,095 --> 01:47:11,183
someone somewhere, who
isn't us, took a new lover.

1761
01:47:15,729 --> 01:47:17,105
On Friday...

1762
01:47:18,941 --> 01:47:20,609
I was the queen...

1763
01:47:25,197 --> 01:47:26,448
of almost.

1764
01:47:31,036 --> 01:47:32,204
Today...

1765
01:47:37,292 --> 01:47:39,378
Today, I...

1766
01:47:39,461 --> 01:47:40,629
I...

1767
01:47:41,838 --> 01:47:43,215
I...

1768
01:47:51,682 --> 01:47:53,684
Shall we get you that soup?

1769
01:47:57,813 --> 01:47:59,398
Not yet.

1770
01:47:59,481 --> 01:48:00,691
Not yet.

1771
01:48:01,525 --> 01:48:02,776
Oh, my dear.

1772
01:48:04,069 --> 01:48:05,529
What is to be done?

1773
01:48:07,072 --> 01:48:09,324
Just my old wound from the war.

1774
01:48:10,909 --> 01:48:12,452
Damn that war.

1775
01:48:23,839 --> 01:48:27,342
You told me one day you would let
me read Christian's last letter.

1776
01:48:31,179 --> 01:48:32,264
Now?

1777
01:48:35,267 --> 01:48:36,268
Please.

1778
01:49:04,212 --> 01:49:05,464
Thank you.

1779
01:49:16,934 --> 01:49:19,311
"Farewell, Roxanne...

1780
01:49:19,394 --> 01:49:22,397
"I believe this will be
my last day, my beloved.

1781
01:49:23,732 --> 01:49:26,985
"My soul is heavy with unexpressed love.

1782
01:49:28,570 --> 01:49:31,823
"Fullness of heart cannot be recorded.

1783
01:49:31,907 --> 01:49:34,952
"It will not live on in
my bones when I am gone.

1784
01:49:37,329 --> 01:49:39,498
"It will not be buried in my grave.

1785
01:49:40,958 --> 01:49:43,418
"The exact measure of my
love cannot be given to you...

1786
01:49:43,502 --> 01:49:45,545
"in words to outlast my last breath.

1787
01:49:45,629 --> 01:49:47,839
"No matter how I wish it, for I am dust.

1788
01:49:47,923 --> 01:49:49,591
"And dust to dust...

1789
01:49:50,759 --> 01:49:52,970
"I'm going to die today, my love."

1790
01:49:53,053 --> 01:49:54,429
You are not reading.

1791
01:49:56,181 --> 01:49:57,808
You are remembering.

1792
01:50:05,816 --> 01:50:07,359
It was you.

1793
01:50:07,442 --> 01:50:08,527
No, Roxanne.

1794
01:50:08,610 --> 01:50:10,862
- Make your confession.
- No, Roxanne.

1795
01:50:10,946 --> 01:50:12,114
- The letters.
- No.

1796
01:50:12,197 --> 01:50:13,282
- The words.
- No.

1797
01:50:13,365 --> 01:50:15,367
The voice in the night below my balcony.

1798
01:50:15,450 --> 01:50:16,994
All of it. You.

1799
01:50:17,077 --> 01:50:18,996
I married him that night
because of your words.

1800
01:50:19,079 --> 01:50:20,205
You married him, not my words.

1801
01:50:20,289 --> 01:50:21,456
Why are you denying it?

1802
01:50:21,540 --> 01:50:23,542
Because I do not love you, my love.

1803
01:50:24,668 --> 01:50:26,628
- Yes, you do.
- Christian loved you.

1804
01:50:26,712 --> 01:50:28,380
- You wrote that letter.
- No.

1805
01:50:28,463 --> 01:50:30,132
- That tear is yours.
- The blood is his!

1806
01:50:30,215 --> 01:50:32,759
Why tell me now? Why?

1807
01:50:32,843 --> 01:50:35,053
I believe this will be my last day.

1808
01:50:35,137 --> 01:50:36,138
No.

1809
01:50:39,641 --> 01:50:40,726
No.

1810
01:50:41,977 --> 01:50:43,020
No.

1811
01:50:45,230 --> 01:50:47,733
<i>No, Cyrano</i>

1812
01:50:47,816 --> 01:50:50,944
<i>I won't let you go</i>

1813
01:50:51,028 --> 01:50:55,198
<i>How can you not see?</i>

1814
01:50:56,491 --> 01:50:59,411
<i>I'm alone, Cyrano</i>

1815
01:50:59,494 --> 01:51:02,915
<i>I've nowhere to go</i>

1816
01:51:02,998 --> 01:51:07,419
<i>You have to stay with me</i>

1817
01:51:09,379 --> 01:51:11,423
<i>Oh, Roxanne</i>

1818
01:51:11,506 --> 01:51:14,801
<i>I don't understand</i>

1819
01:51:14,885 --> 01:51:19,264
<i>The one you love's not here</i>

1820
01:51:20,807 --> 01:51:23,268
<i>I buried that man</i>

1821
01:51:23,352 --> 01:51:26,355
<i>With my very own hands</i>

1822
01:51:26,438 --> 01:51:31,193
<i>Long ago in a blackberry field</i>

1823
01:51:32,611 --> 01:51:37,532
<i>Have you ever wanted something</i>

1824
01:51:38,700 --> 01:51:44,206
<i>So badly you cannot breathe</i>

1825
01:51:44,289 --> 01:51:49,211
<i>Have you ever loved someone</i>

1826
01:51:50,712 --> 01:51:53,006
<i>Madly</i>

1827
01:51:56,885 --> 01:51:59,555
<i>It's okay, Roxanne</i>

1828
01:51:59,638 --> 01:52:02,307
<i>I've known what I am</i>

1829
01:52:02,391 --> 01:52:06,895
<i>From the second your eyes held mine</i>

1830
01:52:09,189 --> 01:52:11,233
<i>Ever since then</i>

1831
01:52:11,316 --> 01:52:14,486
<i>I've been a patient man</i>

1832
01:52:15,279 --> 01:52:19,408
<i>Patient with desire</i>

1833
01:52:21,034 --> 01:52:23,829
<i>I know, Cyrano</i>

1834
01:52:23,912 --> 01:52:27,124
<i>I know who you are</i>

1835
01:52:27,207 --> 01:52:31,295
<i>Love, I feel the same</i>

1836
01:52:33,046 --> 01:52:35,799
<i>So, no, Cyrano</i>

1837
01:52:35,882 --> 01:52:38,844
<i>I won't let you go</i>

1838
01:52:38,927 --> 01:52:43,974
<i>Love's a painful painful game</i>

1839
01:52:45,767 --> 01:52:47,227
You love me.

1840
01:52:48,312 --> 01:52:49,313
Yes.

1841
01:52:50,230 --> 01:52:52,524
And I will not lose you twice.

1842
01:53:11,460 --> 01:53:16,298
<i>- Have you ever wanted something
- Wanted something</i>

1843
01:53:17,633 --> 01:53:22,137
<i>So badly you cannot breathe</i>

1844
01:53:23,555 --> 01:53:28,352
<i>Have you ever loved someone</i>

1845
01:53:29,978 --> 01:53:31,980
<i>Madly</i>

1846
01:53:35,108 --> 01:53:37,527
It's you I love.

1847
01:53:39,905 --> 01:53:41,990
You loved the words.

1848
01:53:42,491 --> 01:53:43,992
No.

1849
01:53:44,076 --> 01:53:45,285
You.

1850
01:53:48,288 --> 01:53:50,457
I love Cyrano.

1851
01:53:50,540 --> 01:53:52,459
Cyrano is my love.

1852
01:53:53,710 --> 01:53:56,004
I have always loved Cyrano.

1853
01:54:01,009 --> 01:54:02,761
And I loved...

1854
01:54:04,346 --> 01:54:05,764
my pride.

1855
01:54:10,769 --> 01:54:11,853
No.

1856
01:54:15,524 --> 01:54:16,525
No.
