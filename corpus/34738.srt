1
00:01:51,902 --> 00:01:53,870
Mr. Dufresne, describe...

2
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:58,405
...the confrontation you had with
your wife the night she was murdered.

3
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,740
It was very bitter.

4
00:02:05,081 --> 00:02:09,415
She said she was glad I knew,
that she hated all the sneaking around.

5
00:02:10,953 --> 00:02:14,444
And she said that she wanted
a divorce in Reno.

6
00:02:14,691 --> 00:02:18,354
-What was your response?
-I told her I would not grant one.

7
00:02:18,561 --> 00:02:21,723
"I'll see you in hell
before I see you in Reno."

8
00:02:21,931 --> 00:02:25,264
Those were your words,
according to your neighbors.

9
00:02:26,335 --> 00:02:27,961
If they say so.

10
00:02:28,472 --> 00:02:30,996
I really don't remember.
I was upset.

11
00:02:31,274 --> 00:02:33,706
What happened after you argued
with your wife?

12
00:02:34,877 --> 00:02:36,639
She packed a bag.

13
00:02:37,812 --> 00:02:40,977
She packed a bag to go
and stay with Mr. Quentin.

14
00:02:41,617 --> 00:02:45,713
Glenn Quentin, golf pro
at the Snowden Hills Country Club...

15
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,049
...whom you had discovered
was your wife 's lover.

16
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,554
Did you follow her?

17
00:02:53,895 --> 00:02:55,989
I went to a few bars first.

18
00:02:56,198 --> 00:03:00,567
Later, I drove to his house
to confront them. They weren't home.

19
00:03:01,138 --> 00:03:02,662
I parked in the turnout...

20
00:03:03,372 --> 00:03:04,360
...and waited.

21
00:03:04,573 --> 00:03:06,234
With what intention?

22
00:03:06,842 --> 00:03:08,275
I'm not sure.

23
00:03:09,412 --> 00:03:10,877
I was confused...

24
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,138
...drunk.

25
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:14,947
I think...

26
00:03:15,151 --> 00:03:17,245
...mostly I wanted to scare them.

27
00:03:17,485 --> 00:03:20,888
When they arrived, you went up
to the house and murdered them.

28
00:03:21,824 --> 00:03:23,188
I was sobering up.

29
00:03:23,393 --> 00:03:27,055
I got back in the car
and I drove home to sleep it off.

30
00:03:27,263 --> 00:03:30,233
Along the way, I threw my gun
into the Royal River.

31
00:03:30,431 --> 00:03:32,423
I've been very clear on this point.

32
00:03:32,668 --> 00:03:36,729
I get hazy where the cleaning woman
shows up the following morning...

33
00:03:36,938 --> 00:03:39,532
...and finds your wife in bed
with her lover...

34
00:03:39,741 --> 00:03:41,835
...riddled with .38-caliber bullets.

35
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:47,411
Does that strike you as a
fantastic coincidence, or is it just me?

36
00:03:48,317 --> 00:03:49,306
Yes, it does.

37
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,681
Yet you still maintain
you threw your gun into the river...

38
00:03:52,888 --> 00:03:54,947
...before the murders took place.

39
00:03:55,157 --> 00:03:57,388
That's very convenient.

40
00:03:57,592 --> 00:03:59,253
It's the truth.

41
00:03:59,627 --> 00:04:04,191
The police dragged that river for
three days, and nary a gun was found...

42
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,496
...so no comparison could be made
between your gun and the bullets...

43
00:04:08,705 --> 00:04:12,139
...taken from the bloodstained corpses
of the victims.

44
00:04:12,807 --> 00:04:15,207
And that also...

45
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:19,113
...is very convenient.
Isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?

46
00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:22,507
Since I am innocent of this crime...

47
00:04:22,718 --> 00:04:27,348
...I find it decidedly inconvenient
that the gun was never found.

48
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,608
Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard
all the evidence.

49
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:52,644
We have the accused at the scene
of the crime. We have footprints.

50
00:04:52,848 --> 00:04:55,714
Bullets on the ground
bearing his fingerprints.

51
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:58,887
A broken bourbon bottle,
likewise with fingerprints.

52
00:04:59,088 --> 00:05:00,646
And most of all...

53
00:05:00,855 --> 00:05:03,915
...we have a beautiful young woman
and her lover...

54
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,151
...lying dead in each other's arms.

55
00:05:07,329 --> 00:05:09,956
They had sinned.

56
00:05:11,165 --> 00:05:13,690
But was their crime so great...

57
00:05:13,968 --> 00:05:16,163
...as to merit a death sentence?

58
00:05:16,372 --> 00:05:18,670
While you think about that...

59
00:05:20,108 --> 00:05:21,906
...think about this:

60
00:05:22,778 --> 00:05:26,509
A revolver holds six bullets, not eight.

61
00:05:26,714 --> 00:05:30,411
I submit that this was not
a hot-blooded crime of passion.

62
00:05:30,619 --> 00:05:33,416
That at least could be understood,
if not condoned.

63
00:05:33,622 --> 00:05:34,646
No.

64
00:05:34,857 --> 00:05:35,983
This was revenge...

65
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:40,627
...of a much more brutal,
cold-blooded nature. Consider this:

66
00:05:40,829 --> 00:05:43,228
Four bullets per victim.

67
00:05:43,966 --> 00:05:45,694
Not six shots fired, but eight.

68
00:05:46,201 --> 00:05:49,795
That means that he fired
the gun empty...

69
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:51,973
...and then stopped to reload...

70
00:05:52,206 --> 00:05:55,665
...so that he could shoot
each of them again.

71
00:05:55,877 --> 00:05:58,437
An extra bullet per lover...

72
00:05:59,213 --> 00:06:00,976
...right in the head.

73
00:06:04,485 --> 00:06:09,286
You strike me as a particularly icy
and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne.

74
00:06:09,692 --> 00:06:11,819
It chills my blood just to look at you.

75
00:06:13,762 --> 00:06:16,526
By the power vested in me
by the state of Maine...

76
00:06:16,732 --> 00:06:20,997
...I hereby order you to serve
two life sentences back-to-back...

77
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,894
...one for each of your victims.
So be it!

78
00:06:49,031 --> 00:06:50,190
Sit.

79
00:06:54,737 --> 00:06:57,569
We see you've served
20 years of a life sentence?

80
00:06:58,507 --> 00:07:01,704
-Yes, sir.
-You feel you've been rehabilitated?

81
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,704
Yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.

82
00:07:05,848 --> 00:07:07,838
I mean, I learned my lesson.

83
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:12,353
I can honestly say
that I'm a changed man.

84
00:07:15,591 --> 00:07:17,956
I'm no longer a danger to society.

85
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,127
That's God's honest truth.

86
00:07:56,432 --> 00:07:57,728
Hey, Red.

87
00:07:57,932 --> 00:07:59,230
How'd it go?

88
00:07:59,435 --> 00:08:01,596
Same old shit, different day.

89
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,735
Yeah, I know how you feel.

90
00:08:03,939 --> 00:08:05,930
I'm up for rejection next week.

91
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:09,233
Yeah, I got rejected last week.

92
00:08:09,444 --> 00:08:10,742
It happens.

93
00:08:10,946 --> 00:08:12,379
Hey, Red, bump me a deck.

94
00:08:12,581 --> 00:08:15,879
Get out of my face, man!
You're into me for five packs already.

95
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:17,084
Four!

96
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,656
There must be a con like me
in every prison in America.

97
00:08:21,857 --> 00:08:23,653
I'm the guy who can get it for you.

98
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,952
Cigarettes, a bag of reefer,
if that's your thing...

99
00:08:27,163 --> 00:08:30,598
...bottle of brandy to celebrate
your kid's high school graduation.

100
00:08:30,798 --> 00:08:32,926
Damn near anything within reason.

101
00:08:33,134 --> 00:08:36,865
Yes, sir!
I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck.

102
00:08:39,807 --> 00:08:42,743
So when Andy Dufresne
came to me in 1949...

103
00:08:42,945 --> 00:08:46,505
...and asked me to smuggle
Rita Hayworth into the prison for him...

104
00:08:46,716 --> 00:08:48,980
...I told him, "No problem. "

105
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,019
Andy came to Shawshank Prison...

106
00:09:33,261 --> 00:09:37,129
...in early 1947 for murdering his wife
and the fella she was banging.

107
00:09:37,466 --> 00:09:41,528
On the outside, he'd been vice president
of a large Portland bank.

108
00:09:41,971 --> 00:09:43,767
Good work for a man so young.

109
00:10:27,014 --> 00:10:28,778
You speak English, butt-steak?

110
00:10:28,985 --> 00:10:30,849
You follow this officer.

111
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:47,865
I never seen such a sorry-looking
heap of maggot shit in all my life.

112
00:10:48,102 --> 00:10:50,697
Hey, fish! Come over here!

113
00:11:13,961 --> 00:11:15,360
Taking bets today, Red?

114
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:17,426
Smokes or coin? Bettor's choice.

115
00:11:17,634 --> 00:11:19,327
Smokes. Put me down for two.

116
00:11:19,868 --> 00:11:21,426
All right, who's your horse?

117
00:11:21,636 --> 00:11:23,399
That little sack of shit.

118
00:11:25,006 --> 00:11:28,272
-Eighth. He'll be first.
-Bullshit! I'll take that action.

119
00:11:28,476 --> 00:11:30,673
You're out some smokes, son.

120
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:32,642
If you're so smart, you call it.

121
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,942
I'll take that chubby fat-ass there.

122
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:38,745
The fifth one.
Put me down for a quarter deck.

123
00:11:41,956 --> 00:11:43,653
Fresh fish today!

124
00:11:44,426 --> 00:11:45,894
We're reeling them in!

125
00:11:46,562 --> 00:11:50,224
I admit I didn't think much of Andy
first time I laid eyes on him.

126
00:11:50,765 --> 00:11:53,668
Looked like a stiff breeze
would blow him over.

127
00:11:54,001 --> 00:11:56,129
That was my first impression of the man.

128
00:11:56,337 --> 00:11:57,770
What do you say?

129
00:11:57,972 --> 00:12:01,272
That tall drink of water
with the silver spoon up his ass.

130
00:12:01,475 --> 00:12:03,602
That guy? Never happen.

131
00:12:03,812 --> 00:12:06,076
-1 0 cigarettes.
-That's a rich bet.

132
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,341
Who's going to prove me wrong?

133
00:12:08,549 --> 00:12:10,346
Heywood? Jigger?

134
00:12:10,653 --> 00:12:11,948
Skeets?

135
00:12:12,153 --> 00:12:13,485
Floyd!

136
00:12:14,423 --> 00:12:16,481
Four brave souls.

137
00:12:16,692 --> 00:12:19,456
Return to your cellblocks
for evening count.

138
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:22,961
All prisoners,
return to your cellblocks.

139
00:12:43,351 --> 00:12:44,477
Turn to the right!

140
00:12:44,687 --> 00:12:45,982
Eyes front.

141
00:12:59,067 --> 00:13:01,660
This is Mr. Hadley.
He's captain of the guards.

142
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,962
I'm Mr. Norton, the warden.

143
00:13:04,173 --> 00:13:06,366
You are convicted felons.

144
00:13:06,674 --> 00:13:08,666
That's why they've sent you to me.

145
00:13:09,245 --> 00:13:10,644
Rule number one:

146
00:13:10,846 --> 00:13:12,336
No blasphemy.

147
00:13:12,847 --> 00:13:16,283
I'll not have the Lord's name
taken in vain in my prison.

148
00:13:16,485 --> 00:13:17,678
The other rules...

149
00:13:17,885 --> 00:13:21,184
...you'll figure out as you go along.
Any questions?

150
00:13:21,557 --> 00:13:22,615
When do we eat?

151
00:13:31,298 --> 00:13:33,323
You eat when we say you eat.

152
00:13:33,534 --> 00:13:36,799
You shit when we say you shit,
and piss when we say you piss.

153
00:13:37,004 --> 00:13:39,837
You got that,
you maggot-dick motherfucker?

154
00:13:41,711 --> 00:13:43,075
On your feet.

155
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:45,041
I believe in two things:

156
00:13:45,246 --> 00:13:47,716
Discipline and the Bible.

157
00:13:48,216 --> 00:13:50,274
Here, you'll receive both.

158
00:13:51,052 --> 00:13:53,212
Put your trust in the Lord.

159
00:13:53,788 --> 00:13:56,052
Your ass belongs to me.

160
00:13:57,894 --> 00:13:59,793
Welcome to Shawshank.

161
00:14:04,966 --> 00:14:06,331
Unhook them.

162
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,139
Turn around.

163
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,413
That's enough.

164
00:14:22,317 --> 00:14:24,307
Move to the end of the cage.

165
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,846
Turn around. Delouse him.

166
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,254
Turn around.

167
00:14:34,096 --> 00:14:36,791
Move out of the cage.
Pick up your clothes and Bible.

168
00:14:36,998 --> 00:14:38,328
Next man up!

169
00:14:40,634 --> 00:14:42,067
To the right.

170
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:43,327
Right. Right.

171
00:14:43,904 --> 00:14:45,134
Left.

172
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:49,341
The first night's the toughest.
No doubt about it.

173
00:14:49,778 --> 00:14:52,905
They march you in
naked as the day you were born...

174
00:14:53,115 --> 00:14:56,913
...skin burning and half-blind
from that delousing shit.

175
00:14:57,586 --> 00:14:59,985
And when they put you in that cell...

176
00:15:00,187 --> 00:15:02,519
...and those bars slam home...

177
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:05,187
...that's when you know it's for real.

178
00:15:05,826 --> 00:15:08,796
Old life blown away
in the blink of an eye.

179
00:15:09,298 --> 00:15:13,394
Nothing left but all the time
in the world to think about it.

180
00:15:14,469 --> 00:15:17,870
Most new fish come close to madness
the first night.

181
00:15:18,206 --> 00:15:21,140
Somebody always breaks down crying.

182
00:15:21,644 --> 00:15:23,303
Happens every time.

183
00:15:24,211 --> 00:15:26,009
The only question is...

184
00:15:26,214 --> 00:15:27,976
...who's it going to be?

185
00:15:29,384 --> 00:15:32,318
It's as good a thing
to bet on as any, I guess.

186
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:36,049
I had my money on Andy Dufresne.

187
00:15:45,067 --> 00:15:46,726
Lights out!

188
00:16:07,254 --> 00:16:09,586
I remember my first night.

189
00:16:10,424 --> 00:16:13,360
Seems like a long time ago.

190
00:16:16,597 --> 00:16:18,190
Hey, fish.

191
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,030
Fish, fish.

192
00:16:22,605 --> 00:16:24,366
What are you, scared of the dark?

193
00:16:26,707 --> 00:16:29,403
Bet you wish your daddy
never dicked your mama!

194
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:33,048
Piggy! Pork!
I want me a pork chop.

195
00:16:41,389 --> 00:16:44,620
The boys always go fishing
with first-timers.

196
00:16:44,961 --> 00:16:47,894
And they don't quit
till they reel someone in.

197
00:16:49,298 --> 00:16:50,889
Hey, Fat Ass.

198
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,730
Fat Ass!

199
00:16:54,903 --> 00:16:56,633
Talk to me, boy.

200
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:00,038
I know you're there.
I can hear you breathing.

201
00:17:00,241 --> 00:17:03,211
Don't you listen to these nitwits,
you hear me?

202
00:17:03,412 --> 00:17:05,310
This place ain't so bad.

203
00:17:05,748 --> 00:17:06,976
Tell you what...

204
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,344
...I'll introduce you around,
make you feel right at home.

205
00:17:11,921 --> 00:17:14,913
I know a couple of
big old bull queers that'd just...

206
00:17:15,156 --> 00:17:17,089
...love to make your acquaintance.

207
00:17:17,292 --> 00:17:20,784
Especially that big, white,
mushy butt of yours.

208
00:17:20,997 --> 00:17:22,087
God!

209
00:17:22,763 --> 00:17:24,163
I don't belong here!

210
00:17:24,366 --> 00:17:27,200
-We have a winner!
-I want to go home!

211
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:30,132
And it's Fat Ass by a nose!

212
00:17:32,942 --> 00:17:34,671
Fresh fish!

213
00:17:40,781 --> 00:17:42,614
I want to go home!

214
00:17:43,586 --> 00:17:44,813
I want my mother!

215
00:17:45,086 --> 00:17:47,248
I had your mother!
She wasn't that great!

216
00:17:51,626 --> 00:17:53,617
What the Christ is this horseshit?

217
00:17:53,828 --> 00:17:55,922
He blasphemed. I'll tell the warden.

218
00:17:56,132 --> 00:17:58,531
You'll tell him
with my baton up your ass!

219
00:17:58,733 --> 00:17:59,564
Let me out!

220
00:17:59,769 --> 00:18:03,170
What is your malfunction,
you fat barrel of monkey spunk?

221
00:18:03,372 --> 00:18:06,364
Please! I ain't supposed to be here.

222
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:07,933
Not me!

223
00:18:08,144 --> 00:18:10,476
I won't count to three.
Not even to one.

224
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,739
You shut up,
or I'll sing you a lullaby!

225
00:18:13,214 --> 00:18:15,944
Shut up, man. Shut up!

226
00:18:16,685 --> 00:18:19,347
You don't understand.
I'm not supposed to be here.

227
00:18:19,555 --> 00:18:20,852
Open that cell.

228
00:18:21,057 --> 00:18:24,321
Me neither! They run this place
like a fucking prison!

229
00:18:32,167 --> 00:18:33,828
Son of a bitch!

230
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:41,073
Captain, take it easy!

231
00:19:03,465 --> 00:19:06,730
If I hear so much as a mouse fart
in here tonight...

232
00:19:06,935 --> 00:19:10,372
...I swear by God and Jesus,
you will all visit the infirmary.

233
00:19:10,873 --> 00:19:13,204
Every last motherfucker in here.

234
00:19:16,612 --> 00:19:20,275
Call the trustees. Take that
tub of shit down to the infirmary.

235
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:39,259
His first night in the joint, Dufresne
cost me two packs of cigarettes.

236
00:19:39,468 --> 00:19:42,460
He never made a sound.

237
00:19:57,819 --> 00:20:00,152
Tier 3 north, clear count!

238
00:20:01,056 --> 00:20:02,886
Tier 2 north, clear count.

239
00:20:03,392 --> 00:20:05,758
Tier 3 south, clear.

240
00:20:10,598 --> 00:20:12,156
Prepare to roll out.

241
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:17,260
Roll out!

242
00:21:11,192 --> 00:21:13,354
Are you going to eat that?

243
00:21:13,996 --> 00:21:16,294
I hadn't planned on it.

244
00:21:17,365 --> 00:21:18,594
Do you mind?

245
00:21:27,175 --> 00:21:28,575
That's nice and ripe.

246
00:21:40,321 --> 00:21:42,381
Jake says thank you.

247
00:21:42,892 --> 00:21:46,055
Fell out of his nest
over by the plate shop.

248
00:21:47,496 --> 00:21:50,863
I'm going to look after him
until he's big enough to fly.

249
00:21:52,334 --> 00:21:53,800
Oh, no! Here he comes.

250
00:21:57,138 --> 00:21:58,571
Morning, fellas.

251
00:21:58,807 --> 00:22:00,740
Fine morning, isn't it?

252
00:22:01,076 --> 00:22:03,306
You know why it's a fine morning,
don't you?

253
00:22:03,578 --> 00:22:05,808
Send them down.
I want them lined up...

254
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,641
...just like a pretty little
chorus line.

255
00:22:09,751 --> 00:22:10,945
Look at that.

256
00:22:11,487 --> 00:22:14,650
-I can't stand this guy.
-Oh, Lord!

257
00:22:15,324 --> 00:22:17,791
Yes! Richmond, Virginia.

258
00:22:17,992 --> 00:22:19,357
Smell my ass!

259
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,551
After he smells mine.

260
00:22:21,997 --> 00:22:25,693
That's a shame about your horse
coming in last and all.

261
00:22:25,901 --> 00:22:28,733
But I sure do love
that winning horse of mine, though.

262
00:22:28,938 --> 00:22:31,462
I owe that boy a big kiss
when I see him.

263
00:22:32,106 --> 00:22:36,338
Why don't you give him some of your
cigarettes instead? Lucky fuck!

264
00:22:36,612 --> 00:22:38,170
Hey, Tyrell.

265
00:22:38,513 --> 00:22:40,505
You pull infirmary duty this week?

266
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,041
How's my horse doing anyway?

267
00:22:43,451 --> 00:22:44,577
Dead.

268
00:22:45,421 --> 00:22:47,615
Hadley busted his head up pretty good.

269
00:22:47,823 --> 00:22:50,018
Doc had gone home for the night.

270
00:22:50,526 --> 00:22:52,789
Poor bastard lay there
till this morning.

271
00:22:52,994 --> 00:22:55,462
By then, there wasn't nothing
we could do.

272
00:23:01,769 --> 00:23:03,067
What was his name?

273
00:23:06,442 --> 00:23:07,703
What'd you say?

274
00:23:09,611 --> 00:23:12,010
I was just wondering
if anyone knew his name.

275
00:23:12,681 --> 00:23:15,444
What the fuck do you care, new fish?

276
00:23:16,451 --> 00:23:19,579
Doesn't fucking matter
what his name was. He's dead.

277
00:23:41,643 --> 00:23:43,634
Anybody come at you yet?

278
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,612
Anybody get to you yet?

279
00:23:49,284 --> 00:23:51,808
Hey, we all need friends in here.

280
00:23:52,121 --> 00:23:53,781
I could be a friend to you.

281
00:24:02,998 --> 00:24:04,396
Hard to get.

282
00:24:06,501 --> 00:24:07,991
I like that.

283
00:24:14,942 --> 00:24:18,173
Andy kept pretty much
to himself at first.

284
00:24:18,513 --> 00:24:20,481
I guess he had a lot on his mind...

285
00:24:20,915 --> 00:24:23,749
...trying to adapt
to life on the inside.

286
00:24:24,486 --> 00:24:27,682
Wasn't until a month went by
before he opened his mouth...

287
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:30,256
...to say more than two words
to somebody.

288
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,018
As it turned out...

289
00:24:33,494 --> 00:24:35,359
...that somebody was me.

290
00:24:44,138 --> 00:24:45,902
I'm Andy Dufresne.

291
00:24:47,142 --> 00:24:48,871
Wife-killing banker.

292
00:24:51,113 --> 00:24:52,443
Why'd you do it?

293
00:24:52,881 --> 00:24:54,940
I didn't, since you ask.

294
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:57,382
You're going to fit right in.

295
00:24:57,618 --> 00:25:00,280
Everybody in here's innocent.
Didn't you know that?

296
00:25:00,923 --> 00:25:04,119
-What you in here for?
-Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me.

297
00:25:07,162 --> 00:25:09,721
Rumor has it you're a real cold fish.

298
00:25:09,932 --> 00:25:13,527
You think your shit smells
sweeter than most. Is that right?

299
00:25:13,734 --> 00:25:15,201
What do you think?

300
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:18,631
To tell you the truth,
I haven't made up my mind.

301
00:25:19,775 --> 00:25:22,573
I understand you're a man
that knows how to get things.

302
00:25:23,545 --> 00:25:26,844
I'm known to locate certain things
from time to time.

303
00:25:27,048 --> 00:25:29,608
I wonder if you might get me
a rock hammer.

304
00:25:30,318 --> 00:25:31,615
A rock hammer.

305
00:25:31,987 --> 00:25:34,648
-What is it and why?
-What do you care?

306
00:25:36,023 --> 00:25:38,720
For a toothbrush, I wouldn't ask.
I'd quote a price.

307
00:25:38,926 --> 00:25:41,361
But a toothbrush
is a non-lethal object, isn't it?

308
00:25:42,931 --> 00:25:44,329
Fair enough.

309
00:25:44,766 --> 00:25:47,394
A rock hammer is about
six or seven inches long.

310
00:25:47,603 --> 00:25:49,934
-Looks like a miniature pickax.
-Pickax?

311
00:25:50,138 --> 00:25:51,333
For rocks.

312
00:25:53,942 --> 00:25:55,170
Quartz?

313
00:25:59,114 --> 00:26:02,571
And some mica, shale...

314
00:26:03,818 --> 00:26:05,080
...limestone.

315
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:06,445
So?

316
00:26:07,388 --> 00:26:09,220
So I'm a rock hound.

317
00:26:09,657 --> 00:26:12,751
At least I was in my old life.
I'd like to be again.

318
00:26:13,028 --> 00:26:16,155
Or maybe you'd like to sink your toy
into somebody's skull.

319
00:26:17,633 --> 00:26:19,191
No, I have no enemies here.

320
00:26:19,401 --> 00:26:21,699
No? Wait a while.

321
00:26:23,337 --> 00:26:24,930
Word gets around.

322
00:26:25,606 --> 00:26:28,097
The Sisters have taken
quite a liking to you.

323
00:26:29,478 --> 00:26:31,275
Especially Bogs.

324
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,717
Don't suppose it would help if l
told them I'm not homosexual.

325
00:26:35,917 --> 00:26:37,351
Neither are they.

326
00:26:37,553 --> 00:26:41,010
You have to be human first.
They don't qualify.

327
00:26:45,527 --> 00:26:49,930
Bull queers take by force.
That's all they want or understand.

328
00:26:50,132 --> 00:26:53,659
If I were you, I'd grow eyes
in the back of my head.

329
00:26:53,868 --> 00:26:56,633
-Thanks for the advice.
-Well, that's free.

330
00:26:56,971 --> 00:26:58,940
You understand my concern.

331
00:26:59,141 --> 00:27:01,734
If there's trouble,
I won't use the rock hammer.

332
00:27:02,644 --> 00:27:06,704
Then I'd guess you want to escape.
Tunnel under the wall, maybe.

333
00:27:07,583 --> 00:27:09,278
What did I miss?
What's so funny?

334
00:27:09,684 --> 00:27:12,381
You'll understand
when you see the rock hammer.

335
00:27:14,222 --> 00:27:16,452
What's an item like this usually go for?

336
00:27:16,657 --> 00:27:19,148
Seven dollars in any rock-and-gem shop.

337
00:27:19,661 --> 00:27:22,128
My normal markup's 20 percent.

338
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:24,696
But this is a specialty item.

339
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:29,359
Risk goes up, price goes up.
Let's make it an even 1 0 bucks.

340
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:30,902
Ten it is.

341
00:27:32,641 --> 00:27:34,665
Waste of money, if you ask me.

342
00:27:34,942 --> 00:27:36,240
Why's that?

343
00:27:37,645 --> 00:27:40,672
Folks around this joint
love surprise inspections.

344
00:27:42,284 --> 00:27:44,251
They find it, you're going to lose it.

345
00:27:44,452 --> 00:27:46,546
If they catch you, you don't know me.

346
00:27:46,755 --> 00:27:48,984
Mention my name, we never
do business again.

347
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:52,585
Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum.
Now you got that?

348
00:27:53,428 --> 00:27:54,986
I understand.

349
00:27:56,198 --> 00:27:58,290
Thank you, Mr....

350
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,523
Red.

351
00:28:00,269 --> 00:28:01,566
Name's Red.

352
00:28:03,005 --> 00:28:04,632
Why do they call you that?

353
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:10,401
Maybe it's because I'm Irish.

354
00:28:18,586 --> 00:28:21,453
I could see why some of the boys
took him for snobby.

355
00:28:22,324 --> 00:28:24,758
He had a quiet way about him...

356
00:28:25,093 --> 00:28:29,257
...a walk and a talk that just
wasn't normal around here.

357
00:28:29,597 --> 00:28:31,065
He strolled...

358
00:28:31,266 --> 00:28:35,463
...like a man in the park without a care
or a worry in the world.

359
00:28:35,671 --> 00:28:40,335
Like he had on an invisible coat
that would shield him from this place.

360
00:28:42,277 --> 00:28:44,507
I think it'd be fair to say...

361
00:28:44,779 --> 00:28:47,009
...I liked Andy from the start.

362
00:28:48,549 --> 00:28:52,349
Let's go! Some of us
got a schedule to keep.

363
00:28:55,691 --> 00:28:58,182
Move it! Come on, move it!

364
00:29:00,796 --> 00:29:03,730
How you doing?
How's the wife treating you?

365
00:29:41,869 --> 00:29:43,336
Andy was right.

366
00:29:43,571 --> 00:29:45,801
I finally got the joke.

367
00:29:46,107 --> 00:29:48,508
It would take a man about 600 years...

368
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:51,178
...to tunnel under the wall
with one of these.

369
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:57,384
-Book?
-Not today.

370
00:30:03,424 --> 00:30:04,413
Book?

371
00:30:11,767 --> 00:30:13,928
Delivery for Dufresne.

372
00:30:31,619 --> 00:30:33,211
Here's your book.

373
00:30:38,226 --> 00:30:39,453
Thanks.

374
00:30:45,733 --> 00:30:49,431
We're running low on hexite.
Get on back and fetch us up some.

375
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,298
This will blind you.

376
00:31:28,676 --> 00:31:31,076
Honey, hush.

377
00:31:43,625 --> 00:31:45,593
That's it. You fight!

378
00:31:45,794 --> 00:31:47,260
Better that way.

379
00:31:55,503 --> 00:31:58,597
I wish I could tell you
Andy fought the good fight...

380
00:31:58,807 --> 00:32:00,798
...and the Sisters let him be.

381
00:32:01,375 --> 00:32:03,207
I wish I could tell you that...

382
00:32:03,411 --> 00:32:06,380
...but prison is no fairy-tale world.

383
00:32:07,516 --> 00:32:09,483
He never said who did it.

384
00:32:09,718 --> 00:32:11,309
But we all knew.

385
00:32:16,156 --> 00:32:18,647
Things went on like that for a while.

386
00:32:19,059 --> 00:32:21,550
Prison life consists of routine...

387
00:32:21,829 --> 00:32:23,798
...and then more routine.

388
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,827
Every so often, Andy would show up
with fresh bruises.

389
00:32:31,306 --> 00:32:33,136
The Sisters kept at him.

390
00:32:33,375 --> 00:32:35,433
Sometimes he was able
to fight them off.

391
00:32:35,644 --> 00:32:37,134
Sometimes not.

392
00:32:38,313 --> 00:32:40,473
And that's how it went for Andy.

393
00:32:41,048 --> 00:32:42,811
That was his routine.

394
00:32:43,652 --> 00:32:47,087
I do believe those first two years
were the worst for him.

395
00:32:47,588 --> 00:32:50,955
And I also believe that
if things had gone on that way...

396
00:32:51,292 --> 00:32:53,727
...this place would have
got the best of him.

397
00:32:54,496 --> 00:32:57,294
But then, in the spring of 1949...

398
00:32:57,499 --> 00:32:59,398
...the powers that be decided:

399
00:32:59,601 --> 00:33:02,933
The roof of the license-plate factory
needs resurfacing.

400
00:33:03,137 --> 00:33:06,335
I need a dozen volunteers
for a week's work.

401
00:33:07,041 --> 00:33:08,509
As you know...

402
00:33:09,243 --> 00:33:12,805
...special detail carries with it
special privileges.

403
00:33:13,013 --> 00:33:15,413
It was outdoor detail...

404
00:33:15,817 --> 00:33:20,083
...and May is one damned fine month
to be working outdoors.

405
00:33:20,321 --> 00:33:21,653
Stay in line there.

406
00:33:21,855 --> 00:33:25,019
More than a hundred men
volunteered for the job.

407
00:33:29,297 --> 00:33:32,288
Wallace E. Unger.

408
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,166
Ellis Redding.

409
00:33:35,369 --> 00:33:36,928
Wouldn't you know it?

410
00:33:37,372 --> 00:33:40,671
Me and some fellows I know
were among the names called.

411
00:33:40,875 --> 00:33:42,865
Andrew Dufresne.

412
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:46,212
It only cost us
a pack of smokes per man.

413
00:33:46,714 --> 00:33:49,182
I made my usual 20 percent, of course.

414
00:33:49,384 --> 00:33:52,842
So this big-shot lawyer
calls me long-distance from Texas.

415
00:33:53,054 --> 00:33:54,612
I say, "Yeah?"

416
00:33:54,888 --> 00:33:58,518
He says, "Sorry to inform you,
but your brother just died."

417
00:33:58,727 --> 00:34:02,628
-I'm sorry to hear that.
-I'm not. He was an asshole.

418
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:05,026
Ran off years ago.
Figured him for dead.

419
00:34:05,232 --> 00:34:07,530
So this lawyer fellow says to me:

420
00:34:07,736 --> 00:34:11,865
"He died a rich man." Oil wells
and shit. Close to a million bucks.

421
00:34:12,539 --> 00:34:14,405
A million bucks?

422
00:34:14,708 --> 00:34:19,202
-Incredible how lucky some assholes get.
-You going to see any of that?

423
00:34:19,813 --> 00:34:22,577
Thirty-five thousand.
That's what he left me.

424
00:34:22,784 --> 00:34:23,978
Dollars?

425
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:27,710
That's great! That's like
winning the sweepstakes.

426
00:34:28,056 --> 00:34:29,148
Isn't it?

427
00:34:29,356 --> 00:34:32,326
Dumb shit, what do you think
the government will do to me?

428
00:34:32,527 --> 00:34:34,893
Take a big wet bite
out of my ass is what.

429
00:34:35,664 --> 00:34:36,994
Poor Byron.

430
00:34:37,898 --> 00:34:41,061
Terrible fucking luck, huh?
Crying shame.

431
00:34:41,268 --> 00:34:43,532
Some people really got it awful.

432
00:34:43,804 --> 00:34:45,170
Andy, are you nuts?

433
00:34:45,373 --> 00:34:47,273
Keep your eyes on your mop, man!

434
00:34:47,474 --> 00:34:50,443
You'll pay some tax,
but you'll still end up--

435
00:34:50,643 --> 00:34:53,442
Yeah, maybe enough to buy
a new car, and then what?

436
00:34:53,648 --> 00:34:55,807
I got to pay tax on the car. Repair...

437
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:59,782
...maintenance, kids pestering you
to take them for a ride all the time.

438
00:35:00,021 --> 00:35:03,682
Then if you figure your tax wrong,
you pay out of your own pocket.

439
00:35:03,891 --> 00:35:06,018
I tell you! Uncle Sam!

440
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:10,253
He puts his hand in your shirt
and squeezes your tit till it's purple.

441
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,061
-Getting himself killed.
-Keep tarring.

442
00:35:15,302 --> 00:35:17,827
Some brother.
Shit!

443
00:35:22,777 --> 00:35:24,175
Mr. Hadley...

444
00:35:25,045 --> 00:35:26,411
...do you trust your wife?

445
00:35:28,047 --> 00:35:29,516
Oh, that's funny.

446
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:32,643
You'll look funnier
sucking my dick with no teeth.

447
00:35:32,887 --> 00:35:36,219
What I mean is, do you think
she'd go behind your back?

448
00:35:37,358 --> 00:35:40,724
Step aside, Mert. This fucker's
having himself an accident.

449
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,985
He'll push him off!

450
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:44,061
If you trust her, you can keep...

451
00:35:44,297 --> 00:35:45,697
...that 35,000.

452
00:35:46,432 --> 00:35:48,925
-What did you say?
-Thirty-five thousand.

453
00:35:49,771 --> 00:35:50,795
All of it.

454
00:35:51,005 --> 00:35:54,065
-Every penny.
-You better start making sense.

455
00:35:54,275 --> 00:35:56,606
If you want to keep it,
give it to your wife.

456
00:35:56,811 --> 00:36:00,711
The IRS allows a one-time-only gift
to your spouse for up to $60,000.

457
00:36:00,914 --> 00:36:03,280
-Bullshit. Tax-free?
-Tax-free.

458
00:36:03,485 --> 00:36:05,452
IRS can't touch one cent.

459
00:36:05,853 --> 00:36:08,322
You're that smart banker
that killed his wife.

460
00:36:08,556 --> 00:36:11,922
Why should I believe you?
So I can end up in here with you?

461
00:36:12,126 --> 00:36:14,960
It's legal. Ask the IRS.
They'll say the same thing.

462
00:36:15,163 --> 00:36:19,224
I feel stupid telling you this.
I'm sure you would have investigated.

463
00:36:19,432 --> 00:36:23,096
I don't need you to tell me
where the bear shit in the buckwheat.

464
00:36:23,304 --> 00:36:26,704
Of course not. But you do need
someone to set it up for you.

465
00:36:26,907 --> 00:36:28,465
That'll cost you. A lawyer.

466
00:36:28,675 --> 00:36:30,940
A bunch of ball-washing bastards!

467
00:36:31,411 --> 00:36:34,869
I suppose I could set it up for you.
That would save you some money.

468
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:37,141
You get the forms, I'll prepare them...

469
00:36:37,384 --> 00:36:39,114
...nearly free of charge.

470
00:36:40,355 --> 00:36:43,652
I'd only ask three beers apiece
for each of my coworkers.

471
00:36:44,625 --> 00:36:46,150
"Coworkers." That's rich!

472
00:36:46,994 --> 00:36:49,518
A man working outdoors
feels more like a man...

473
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:53,188
...if he can have a bottle of suds.
That's only my opinion...

474
00:36:53,634 --> 00:36:54,623
...sir.

475
00:36:58,572 --> 00:37:00,507
What are you jimmies staring at?

476
00:37:00,708 --> 00:37:02,300
Let's go! Work!

477
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,753
And that's how it came to pass...

478
00:37:13,954 --> 00:37:16,617
...that on the second-to-last
day of the job...

479
00:37:16,824 --> 00:37:21,387
...the convict crew that tarred
the factory roof in the spring of '49...

480
00:37:21,596 --> 00:37:24,724
...wound up sitting in a row
at 10:00 in the morning...

481
00:37:24,931 --> 00:37:30,393
...drinking icy-cold beer,
courtesy of the hardest screw...

482
00:37:30,605 --> 00:37:33,869
...that ever walked a turn
at Shawshank State Prison.

483
00:37:34,074 --> 00:37:36,509
Drink up while it's cold, ladies.

484
00:37:37,612 --> 00:37:42,172
The colossal prick even managed
to sound magnanimous.

485
00:37:43,317 --> 00:37:47,777
We sat and drank with the sun
on our shoulders and felt like free men.

486
00:37:48,155 --> 00:37:51,592
We could have been tarring
the roof of one of our own houses.

487
00:37:51,793 --> 00:37:54,625
We were the lords of all creation.

488
00:37:55,195 --> 00:37:56,788
As for Andy...

489
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:59,659
...he spent that break
hunkered in the shade...

490
00:37:59,867 --> 00:38:02,358
...a strange little smile on his face...

491
00:38:02,603 --> 00:38:04,797
...watching us drink his beer.

492
00:38:12,913 --> 00:38:14,277
Want a cold one?

493
00:38:14,949 --> 00:38:17,884
No, thanks. I gave up drinking.

494
00:38:21,855 --> 00:38:24,916
You could argue he done it
to curry favor with the guards.

495
00:38:25,626 --> 00:38:29,427
Or maybe make a few friends
among us cons.

496
00:38:30,163 --> 00:38:31,221
Me?

497
00:38:31,431 --> 00:38:34,230
I think he did it
just to feel normal again...

498
00:38:34,668 --> 00:38:36,898
...if only for a short while.

499
00:38:39,539 --> 00:38:40,632
King me.

500
00:38:42,509 --> 00:38:45,137
-Chess. Now there's a game of kings.
-What?

501
00:38:45,346 --> 00:38:47,074
Civilized. Strategic.

502
00:38:47,748 --> 00:38:50,739
And a total fucking mystery.
I hate it.

503
00:38:51,018 --> 00:38:52,782
Let me teach you someday.

504
00:38:54,355 --> 00:38:55,322
Sure.

505
00:38:55,789 --> 00:38:57,518
We could get a board together.

506
00:38:57,759 --> 00:39:00,818
You're talking to the right man.
I can get things, right?

507
00:39:01,027 --> 00:39:05,021
We might do business on a board,
and I'll carve the pieces myself.

508
00:39:05,233 --> 00:39:08,532
One side in alabaster, one in soapstone.
What do you think?

509
00:39:09,137 --> 00:39:10,536
I think it'll take years.

510
00:39:10,737 --> 00:39:13,262
Years I got.
What I don't have are the rocks.

511
00:39:13,474 --> 00:39:15,442
Pickings are pretty slim in the yard.

512
00:39:15,643 --> 00:39:17,474
Pebbles, mostly.

513
00:39:21,815 --> 00:39:24,614
We're getting to be
kind of friends, aren't we?

514
00:39:25,485 --> 00:39:27,043
Yeah, I guess.

515
00:39:27,688 --> 00:39:29,211
Can I ask you something?

516
00:39:30,692 --> 00:39:32,125
Why'd you do it?

517
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,918
I'm innocent, Red.

518
00:39:35,128 --> 00:39:37,152
Just like everybody else here.

519
00:39:41,501 --> 00:39:43,059
What are you in for?

520
00:39:45,773 --> 00:39:47,932
Murder. Same as you.

521
00:39:48,141 --> 00:39:49,302
Innocent?

522
00:39:52,012 --> 00:39:54,413
Only guilty man in Shawshank.

523
00:40:53,739 --> 00:40:55,230
Where's the canary?

524
00:40:55,442 --> 00:40:56,739
How did you know?

525
00:40:56,943 --> 00:40:59,242
-How did I know what?
-So you don't know.

526
00:40:59,447 --> 00:41:00,606
Come.

527
00:41:03,117 --> 00:41:05,210
This is where the canary is.

528
00:41:07,889 --> 00:41:11,221
Quite a surprise to hear
a woman singing in my house, eh?

529
00:41:14,728 --> 00:41:16,128
That's quite a...

530
00:41:17,065 --> 00:41:18,726
...surprise.

531
00:41:23,036 --> 00:41:24,436
Wait, wait.

532
00:41:24,971 --> 00:41:26,460
Here she comes.

533
00:41:26,739 --> 00:41:29,608
I like this part when she
does that shit with her hair.

534
00:41:29,811 --> 00:41:32,541
I know. I've seen it
three times this month.

535
00:41:32,746 --> 00:41:34,646
Gilda, are you decent?

536
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:36,775
Me?

537
00:41:39,487 --> 00:41:41,250
God, I love it.

538
00:41:46,427 --> 00:41:49,418
I understand you're a man
that knows how to get things.

539
00:41:50,431 --> 00:41:54,161
I'm known to locate certain things
from time to time. What do you want?

540
00:41:54,367 --> 00:41:56,494
-Rita Hayworth.
-What?

541
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:58,436
Can you get her?

542
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:03,208
So this is Johnny Farrel.
I've heard a lot about you.

543
00:42:04,445 --> 00:42:06,742
-Take a few weeks.
-Weeks?

544
00:42:06,947 --> 00:42:11,351
I don't have her stuffed down the front
of my pants right now, sorry to say.

545
00:42:11,918 --> 00:42:13,250
But I'll get her.

546
00:42:13,454 --> 00:42:14,784
Relax.

547
00:42:16,657 --> 00:42:17,954
Thanks.

548
00:42:38,545 --> 00:42:40,307
-Get out!
-I got to change reels!

549
00:42:40,547 --> 00:42:42,538
I said fuck off!

550
00:42:48,688 --> 00:42:50,054
Ain't you going to scream?

551
00:42:51,391 --> 00:42:53,257
Let's get this over with.

552
00:42:58,364 --> 00:43:00,356
He broke my fucking nose!

553
00:43:09,677 --> 00:43:10,903
Now...

554
00:43:11,378 --> 00:43:13,539
...I'm going to open my fly...

555
00:43:13,813 --> 00:43:16,577
...and you'll swallow
what I give you to swallow.

556
00:43:17,717 --> 00:43:20,311
Then you'll swallow Rooster's.
You broke his nose.

557
00:43:20,521 --> 00:43:22,648
He ought to have
something to show for it.

558
00:43:22,856 --> 00:43:24,721
You put it in my mouth,
you lose it.

559
00:43:24,925 --> 00:43:27,518
No, you don't understand.

560
00:43:27,862 --> 00:43:30,887
Do that and I'll put all eight inches
of this in your ear.

561
00:43:31,097 --> 00:43:34,556
All right, but you should know
that sudden, serious brain injury...

562
00:43:34,768 --> 00:43:36,702
...causes the victim to bite down hard.

563
00:43:36,902 --> 00:43:40,396
In fact, I hear the bite reflex
is so strong...

564
00:43:41,208 --> 00:43:43,677
...they have to pry
the victim's jaws open...

565
00:43:43,878 --> 00:43:45,242
...with a crowbar.

566
00:43:48,215 --> 00:43:49,739
Where do you get this shit?

567
00:43:49,951 --> 00:43:51,349
I read it.

568
00:43:52,753 --> 00:43:55,414
You know how to read,
you ignorant fuck?

569
00:43:57,090 --> 00:43:58,181
Honey!

570
00:44:00,126 --> 00:44:01,855
You shouldn't!

571
00:44:04,532 --> 00:44:07,431
Bogs didn't put anything
in Andy's mouth.

572
00:44:07,701 --> 00:44:09,760
And neither did his friends.

573
00:44:10,204 --> 00:44:14,038
What they did do is beat him
within an inch of his life.

574
00:44:14,708 --> 00:44:17,199
Andy spent a month in the infirmary.

575
00:44:18,012 --> 00:44:20,536
Bogs spent a week in the hole.

576
00:44:24,619 --> 00:44:26,143
Time's up, Bogs.

577
00:44:29,956 --> 00:44:31,617
It's your world, boss.

578
00:44:34,893 --> 00:44:37,692
Return to your cellblocks
for evening count.

579
00:44:37,898 --> 00:44:40,559
All prisoners report for lock down.

580
00:44:55,483 --> 00:44:56,507
What?

581
00:45:09,163 --> 00:45:11,688
-Where's he going?
-Grab his ankles.

582
00:45:17,505 --> 00:45:18,766
Help!

583
00:45:22,442 --> 00:45:25,036
Two things never happened again
after that.

584
00:45:25,313 --> 00:45:28,440
The Sisters never
laid a finger on Andy again.

585
00:45:29,282 --> 00:45:31,773
And Bogs would never walk again.

586
00:45:32,952 --> 00:45:36,445
They transferred him
to a minimum-security hospital upstate.

587
00:45:36,657 --> 00:45:39,420
To my knowledge, he lived out
the rest of his days...

588
00:45:39,626 --> 00:45:41,458
...drinking his food through a straw.

589
00:45:42,461 --> 00:45:46,557
Andy could use a nice welcome back
when he gets out of the infirmary.

590
00:45:48,302 --> 00:45:49,860
Sounds good to us.

591
00:45:50,137 --> 00:45:52,628
I figure we owe him that much
for the beer.

592
00:45:53,373 --> 00:45:55,637
The man likes to play chess.

593
00:45:56,143 --> 00:45:58,043
Let's get him some rocks.

594
00:46:30,677 --> 00:46:31,905
Guys!

595
00:46:32,679 --> 00:46:33,737
I got one.

596
00:46:33,947 --> 00:46:35,438
I got one. Look!

597
00:46:37,351 --> 00:46:41,411
Heywood, that isn't soapstone!
And it ain't alabaster either.

598
00:46:41,621 --> 00:46:43,521
What are you, a fucking geologist?

599
00:46:43,724 --> 00:46:45,452
He's right. It ain't.

600
00:46:45,659 --> 00:46:48,559
-What the hell is it then?
-It's a horse apple.

601
00:46:49,528 --> 00:46:51,929
-Bullshit!
-No, horseshit.

602
00:46:52,132 --> 00:46:53,599
Petrified.

603
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:03,804
Damn!

604
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:08,342
Despite a few hitches,
the boys came through in fine style.

605
00:47:08,547 --> 00:47:10,539
And by the weekend
he was due back...

606
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:14,447
...we had enough rocks saved up
to keep him busy till rapture.

607
00:47:15,288 --> 00:47:17,778
Also got a big shipment in that week.

608
00:47:18,056 --> 00:47:19,182
Cigarettes...

609
00:47:19,393 --> 00:47:20,416
...chewing gum...

610
00:47:20,628 --> 00:47:22,094
...sipping whisky...

611
00:47:22,295 --> 00:47:25,697
...playing cards with naked ladies
on them. You name it.

612
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:28,630
And of course, the most important item:

613
00:47:30,503 --> 00:47:32,563
Rita Hayworth herself.

614
00:48:09,677 --> 00:48:11,940
Heads up.
They're tossing cells.

615
00:48:12,146 --> 00:48:14,842
Heads up.
They're tossing cells!

616
00:48:16,449 --> 00:48:17,940
119.

617
00:48:19,786 --> 00:48:21,447
123.

618
00:48:31,898 --> 00:48:32,728
On your feet.

619
00:48:35,369 --> 00:48:36,858
Face the wall.

620
00:49:11,005 --> 00:49:12,903
Turn around and face the warden.

621
00:49:19,512 --> 00:49:21,572
Pleased to see you reading this.

622
00:49:22,916 --> 00:49:24,851
Any favorite passages?

623
00:49:25,719 --> 00:49:28,085
"Watch ye, therefore,
for ye know not...

624
00:49:28,288 --> 00:49:30,518
...when the master
of the house cometh."

625
00:49:31,659 --> 00:49:33,820
Mark 1 3:35.

626
00:49:34,561 --> 00:49:36,427
I've always liked that one.

627
00:49:37,364 --> 00:49:39,025
But I prefer...

628
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,364
..."l am the light of the world.

629
00:49:41,835 --> 00:49:45,134
Ye that followeth me
shall have the light of life."

630
00:49:45,338 --> 00:49:47,967
John, chapter 8, verse 1 2.

631
00:49:48,242 --> 00:49:50,266
I hear you're good with numbers.

632
00:49:50,476 --> 00:49:51,465
How nice.

633
00:49:52,711 --> 00:49:54,646
Man should have a skill.

634
00:49:57,182 --> 00:49:58,208
Explain this.

635
00:49:59,385 --> 00:50:03,447
It's called a rock blanket.
It's for shaping and polishing rocks.

636
00:50:03,891 --> 00:50:05,791
A little hobby of mine.

637
00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:18,103
It's pretty clean.

638
00:50:18,371 --> 00:50:21,465
Some contraband here,
but nothing to get in a twist over.

639
00:50:25,813 --> 00:50:27,804
I can't say I approve of this.

640
00:50:29,449 --> 00:50:30,916
But I suppose...

641
00:50:32,987 --> 00:50:34,978
...exceptions can be made.

642
00:50:45,364 --> 00:50:46,697
Lock them up!

643
00:50:49,603 --> 00:50:51,161
I almost forgot.

644
00:50:51,605 --> 00:50:53,766
I'd hate to deprive you of this.

645
00:50:54,507 --> 00:50:56,442
Salvation lies within.

646
00:50:56,643 --> 00:50:57,701
Yes, sir.

647
00:51:06,253 --> 00:51:08,813
Tossing cells was just an excuse.

648
00:51:09,288 --> 00:51:10,516
Truth is...

649
00:51:10,724 --> 00:51:13,192
...Norton wanted to size Andy up.

650
00:51:26,873 --> 00:51:29,206
My wife made that in church group.

651
00:51:31,878 --> 00:51:33,175
Very nice, sir.

652
00:51:34,748 --> 00:51:36,215
You enjoy working the laundry?

653
00:51:37,884 --> 00:51:39,579
No, sir. Not especially.

654
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:42,353
Perhaps we can find something more...

655
00:51:42,623 --> 00:51:45,056
...befitting a man of your education.

656
00:51:53,132 --> 00:51:54,623
Hey, Jake.
Where's Brooks?

657
00:51:56,469 --> 00:51:59,233
I thought I heard you out here.

658
00:51:59,907 --> 00:52:01,465
I've been reassigned to you.

659
00:52:01,742 --> 00:52:04,074
I know, they told me.

660
00:52:04,911 --> 00:52:06,971
Ain't that a kick in the head?

661
00:52:07,181 --> 00:52:09,478
Well, I'll give you the dime tour.

662
00:52:09,681 --> 00:52:10,842
Come on.

663
00:52:12,251 --> 00:52:13,980
Well, here she is.

664
00:52:14,188 --> 00:52:16,179
The Shawshank Prison Library.

665
00:52:16,856 --> 00:52:18,847
National Geographics...

666
00:52:19,759 --> 00:52:22,556
... Reader's Digest condensed books...

667
00:52:22,762 --> 00:52:24,355
...and Louis L'Amour.

668
00:52:24,931 --> 00:52:26,762
Look magazine.

669
00:52:27,101 --> 00:52:29,431
Erle Stanley Gardners.

670
00:52:29,702 --> 00:52:33,161
Every evening I load up the cart
and make my rounds.

671
00:52:33,373 --> 00:52:36,034
I enter the names
on this clipboard here.

672
00:52:36,543 --> 00:52:39,273
Easy, peasy, Japanese-y.

673
00:52:40,012 --> 00:52:42,913
-Any questions?
-How long have you been librarian?

674
00:52:44,117 --> 00:52:48,143
I come here in '05,
and they made me librarian in 1 9 1 2.

675
00:52:49,456 --> 00:52:51,617
And have you ever had an assistant?

676
00:52:51,891 --> 00:52:54,291
No. Not much to it, really.

677
00:52:55,061 --> 00:52:56,289
Why me? Why now?

678
00:52:56,730 --> 00:52:58,027
I don't know.

679
00:52:58,231 --> 00:53:01,257
But it'd be nice to have
some company down here.

680
00:53:12,512 --> 00:53:14,811
That's him.
That's the one.

681
00:53:22,456 --> 00:53:23,614
I'm Dekins.

682
00:53:24,023 --> 00:53:25,650
I was thinking...

683
00:53:26,326 --> 00:53:30,193
...about setting up some kind of
trust fund for my kids' educations.

684
00:53:34,101 --> 00:53:35,567
I see.

685
00:53:40,672 --> 00:53:43,643
Why don't we have a seat
and talk it over.

686
00:53:46,846 --> 00:53:49,815
Do you have a piece of paper
and a pencil?

687
00:54:01,161 --> 00:54:02,458
Thanks.

688
00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:04,188
So....

689
00:54:05,965 --> 00:54:07,695
Mister Dekins....

690
00:54:08,534 --> 00:54:10,628
And then Andy says, "Mr. Dekins...

691
00:54:10,836 --> 00:54:13,829
...do you want your sons
to go to Harvard or Yale?"

692
00:54:14,041 --> 00:54:15,099
He didn't say that!

693
00:54:15,442 --> 00:54:17,931
As God as my witness!

694
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:19,940
Dekins blinked for a second...

695
00:54:20,146 --> 00:54:23,275
...then he laughed
and actually shook Andy's hand.

696
00:54:23,717 --> 00:54:25,980
-My ass!
-Shook his hand.

697
00:54:26,219 --> 00:54:29,121
I tell you, I near soiled myself!

698
00:54:29,322 --> 00:54:33,588
All he needed was a suit and tie
and a jiggly hula gal on his desk...

699
00:54:33,793 --> 00:54:36,387
...he'd have been
"Mr. Dufresne," if you please.

700
00:54:36,596 --> 00:54:38,224
Making a few friends?

701
00:54:39,532 --> 00:54:41,193
I wouldn't say "friends."

702
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:45,235
I'm a convicted murderer
who provides sound financial planning.

703
00:54:45,438 --> 00:54:47,771
It's a wonderful pet to have.

704
00:54:47,974 --> 00:54:49,771
Got you out of the laundry, though.

705
00:54:50,309 --> 00:54:52,210
It might do more than that.

706
00:54:52,445 --> 00:54:55,141
How about expanding the library.
Get some new books.

707
00:54:55,349 --> 00:54:57,942
If you ask for something,
ask for a pool table.

708
00:54:59,652 --> 00:55:02,643
How do you expect to do that?
I mean...

709
00:55:02,855 --> 00:55:05,824
...get new books in here,
"Mr. Dufresne, if you please."

710
00:55:06,293 --> 00:55:08,351
I'll ask the warden for funds.

711
00:55:09,228 --> 00:55:13,494
Six wardens have been through here
in my tenure, and I've learned...

712
00:55:13,733 --> 00:55:16,032
...one immutable, universal truth:

713
00:55:16,268 --> 00:55:17,668
Not one born whose asshole...

714
00:55:17,871 --> 00:55:22,806
...wouldn't pucker up tighter than
a snare drum when you ask for funds.

715
00:55:23,677 --> 00:55:26,577
-The budget's stretched thin as it is.
-I see.

716
00:55:26,778 --> 00:55:30,215
Maybe I could write the state senate
and request funds from them.

717
00:55:30,416 --> 00:55:34,512
They have only three ways to spend
the taxpayers' money for prisons:

718
00:55:34,721 --> 00:55:37,153
More walls, more bars, more guards.

719
00:55:37,356 --> 00:55:40,018
I'd like to try, with permission.
A letter a week.

720
00:55:40,226 --> 00:55:42,956
-They can't ignore me forever.
-Sure can.

721
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:45,891
But you write your letters
if it makes you happy.

722
00:55:46,199 --> 00:55:48,793
I'll even mail them for you.
How's that?

723
00:55:50,469 --> 00:55:53,268
So Andy started writing
a letter a week...

724
00:55:53,472 --> 00:55:55,065
...just like he said.

725
00:55:59,246 --> 00:56:01,873
And like Norton said...

726
00:56:02,081 --> 00:56:03,547
...Andy got no answers.

727
00:56:11,757 --> 00:56:16,661
The following April, he did tax returns
for half the guards at Shawshank.

728
00:56:17,998 --> 00:56:20,262
Year after that, he did them all...

729
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:22,432
...including the warden's.

730
00:56:24,170 --> 00:56:27,628
Year after that, they
rescheduled the intramural season...

731
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:30,275
...to coincide with tax season.

732
00:56:31,844 --> 00:56:36,304
The guards on the opposing teams
all remembered to bring their W-2s.

733
00:56:36,516 --> 00:56:37,846
So Moresby Prison...

734
00:56:38,050 --> 00:56:40,315
...issued you a gun,
but you paid for it.

735
00:56:40,554 --> 00:56:42,248
Right. The holster too.

736
00:56:42,456 --> 00:56:44,922
That's tax-deductible.
You can write that off.

737
00:56:45,125 --> 00:56:48,150
Yes, sir!
Andy was a regular cottage industry.

738
00:56:48,862 --> 00:56:53,355
In fact, it got so busy at tax time,
he was allowed a staff.

739
00:56:53,632 --> 00:56:56,101
Could you hand me
a stack of 1 040s?

740
00:56:56,302 --> 00:57:01,137
Got me out of the wood shop a month out
of the year, and that was fine by me.

741
00:57:02,375 --> 00:57:05,538
And still, he kept
sending those letters.

742
00:57:12,318 --> 00:57:13,342
It's Brooks.

743
00:57:14,487 --> 00:57:15,978
Watch the door.

744
00:57:16,222 --> 00:57:17,554
Please, Brooks.

745
00:57:17,824 --> 00:57:19,621
-Calm the fuck down.
-Stay back!

746
00:57:20,059 --> 00:57:22,688
-Stay back, goddamn it!
-What's going on?

747
00:57:22,896 --> 00:57:25,456
One second he's fine,
then out come the knives.

748
00:57:25,664 --> 00:57:27,460
We can talk about this, right?

749
00:57:27,733 --> 00:57:31,465
There's nothing to talk about.
I'll cut his fucking throat.

750
00:57:31,737 --> 00:57:33,467
What's he done to you?

751
00:57:33,672 --> 00:57:35,333
It's what they done!

752
00:57:35,842 --> 00:57:37,103
I got no choice.

753
00:57:37,576 --> 00:57:39,875
You won't hurt Heywood.
We all know that.

754
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:42,547
-Right, Heywood?
-Sure.

755
00:57:42,782 --> 00:57:46,114
He's a friend of yours,
and Brooks is a reasonable man.

756
00:57:46,385 --> 00:57:47,478
Right, guys?

757
00:57:48,422 --> 00:57:50,947
So put the knife down.
Look at me.

758
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:53,420
Put the knife down.

759
00:57:55,362 --> 00:57:57,454
Look at his neck, for God's sake.

760
00:57:58,197 --> 00:58:00,528
Look at his neck. He's bleeding.

761
00:58:01,434 --> 00:58:02,902
It's the only way...

762
00:58:03,103 --> 00:58:05,161
...they'd let me stay.

763
00:58:05,438 --> 00:58:07,804
This is crazy.
You don't want to do this.

764
00:58:08,041 --> 00:58:10,099
Put it, put it down.

765
00:58:18,884 --> 00:58:20,375
Take it easy.

766
00:58:21,054 --> 00:58:22,612
You'll be all right.

767
00:58:23,657 --> 00:58:25,248
Him? What about me?

768
00:58:25,458 --> 00:58:27,858
Crazy old fool damn near cut my throat!

769
00:58:28,061 --> 00:58:29,960
You've had worse from shaving.

770
00:58:30,163 --> 00:58:32,255
What did you do to set him off?

771
00:58:32,465 --> 00:58:34,695
Nothing.
I come in here to say farewell.

772
00:58:35,302 --> 00:58:37,963
Ain't you heard?
His parole's come through.

773
00:58:40,306 --> 00:58:43,105
I just don't understand
what happened in there.

774
00:58:43,309 --> 00:58:46,108
Old man's crazy as a rat
in a tin shithouse.

775
00:58:46,313 --> 00:58:48,211
That's enough out of you.

776
00:58:48,414 --> 00:58:51,143
-Heard he had you shitting your pants.
-Fuck you.

777
00:58:51,418 --> 00:58:52,612
Knock it off.

778
00:58:53,585 --> 00:58:55,018
Brooks ain't no bug.

779
00:58:58,858 --> 00:59:00,621
He's just institutionalized.

780
00:59:01,994 --> 00:59:03,929
"Institutionalized," my ass.

781
00:59:04,130 --> 00:59:08,123
The man's been in here 50 years,
Heywood, 50 years!

782
00:59:08,335 --> 00:59:10,063
This is all he knows.

783
00:59:10,268 --> 00:59:12,567
In here, he's an important man...

784
00:59:12,771 --> 00:59:13,864
...an educated man.

785
00:59:14,672 --> 00:59:16,608
Outside, he's nothing.

786
00:59:17,476 --> 00:59:20,969
Just a used-up con
with arthritis in both hands.

787
00:59:21,181 --> 00:59:24,172
Probably couldn't get a library card
if he tried.

788
00:59:24,451 --> 00:59:26,179
You know what I'm trying to say?

789
00:59:26,452 --> 00:59:29,353
I do believe
you're talking out of your ass.

790
00:59:30,623 --> 00:59:32,853
You believe whatever you want.

791
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:35,860
But I tell you these walls are funny.

792
00:59:37,463 --> 00:59:39,125
First you hate them.

793
00:59:40,967 --> 00:59:42,867
Then you get used to them.

794
00:59:44,804 --> 00:59:46,795
Enough time passes...

795
00:59:47,474 --> 00:59:49,465
...you get so you depend on them.

796
00:59:50,476 --> 00:59:52,672
That's "institutionalized."

797
00:59:52,878 --> 00:59:54,175
Shit.

798
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:57,143
-I could never get like that.
-Oh, yeah?

799
00:59:58,018 --> 01:00:00,509
Wait till you've been here
as long as Brooks.

800
01:00:00,753 --> 01:00:02,311
Goddamn right.

801
01:00:04,891 --> 01:00:06,824
They send you here for life...

802
01:00:07,494 --> 01:00:09,826
...that's exactly what they take.

803
01:00:11,565 --> 01:00:13,556
Part that counts, anyway.

804
01:00:21,172 --> 01:00:24,108
I can't take care of you no more, Jake.

805
01:00:25,277 --> 01:00:26,938
You go on now.

806
01:00:28,181 --> 01:00:29,670
You're free.

807
01:00:30,951 --> 01:00:32,509
You're free.

808
01:00:51,538 --> 01:00:53,199
Good luck, Brooksie.

809
01:01:31,177 --> 01:01:32,666
Dear fellas:

810
01:01:32,945 --> 01:01:37,143
I can't believe how fast things move
on the outside.

811
01:01:38,451 --> 01:01:41,112
Watch it, old-timer!
Want to get killed?

812
01:01:42,355 --> 01:01:45,846
I saw an automobile once
when I was a kid...

813
01:01:46,492 --> 01:01:48,927
...but now they're everywhere.

814
01:01:52,599 --> 01:01:56,898
The world went and got itself
in a big damn hurry.

815
01:02:12,719 --> 01:02:16,485
The parole board
got me into this halfway house...

816
01:02:16,789 --> 01:02:18,451
...called "The Brewer"...

817
01:02:18,657 --> 01:02:19,817
...and a job...

818
01:02:20,025 --> 01:02:22,994
...bagging groceries at the Food-Way.

819
01:02:24,530 --> 01:02:26,965
It's hard work and I try to keep up...

820
01:02:27,166 --> 01:02:29,532
...but my hands hurt most of the time.

821
01:02:29,835 --> 01:02:31,804
Make sure your man double-bags.

822
01:02:32,005 --> 01:02:34,028
Last time, the bottom near came out.

823
01:02:34,708 --> 01:02:37,643
Make sure you double-bag
like the lady says. Understand?

824
01:02:37,844 --> 01:02:39,208
Yes, sir. Surely will.

825
01:02:39,411 --> 01:02:42,938
I don't think the store manager
likes me very much.

826
01:02:45,951 --> 01:02:50,251
Sometimes after work,
I go to the park and feed the birds.

827
01:02:50,690 --> 01:02:52,179
I keep thinking...

828
01:02:52,425 --> 01:02:55,757
...Jake might just show up
and say hello.

829
01:02:56,362 --> 01:02:58,353
But he never does.

830
01:02:59,565 --> 01:03:04,434
I hope, wherever he is, he's doing okay
and making new friends.

831
01:03:08,041 --> 01:03:10,771
I have trouble sleeping at night.

832
01:03:11,076 --> 01:03:14,342
I have bad dreams like I'm falling.

833
01:03:14,614 --> 01:03:16,844
I wake up scared.

834
01:03:17,050 --> 01:03:21,282
Sometimes it takes me a while
to remember where I am.

835
01:03:22,788 --> 01:03:27,692
Maybe I should get a gun and rob
the Food-Way so they'd send me home.

836
01:03:27,994 --> 01:03:32,327
I could shoot the manager while
I was at it. Sort of like a bonus.

837
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,992
I guess I'm too old
for that sort of nonsense anymore.

838
01:03:38,237 --> 01:03:39,967
I don't like it here.

839
01:03:40,172 --> 01:03:44,166
I'm tired of being afraid all the time.
I've decided...

840
01:03:45,010 --> 01:03:46,672
...not to stay.

841
01:03:57,590 --> 01:04:00,150
I doubt they'll kick up any fuss...

842
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:03,851
...not for an old crook like me.

843
01:05:06,326 --> 01:05:10,592
"l doubt they'll kick up any fuss,
not for an old crook like me.

844
01:05:11,630 --> 01:05:15,465
P.S. Tell Heywood I'm sorry
I put a knife to his throat.

845
01:05:15,668 --> 01:05:18,000
No hard feelings. Brooks."

846
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:30,449
He should have died in here.

847
01:05:35,989 --> 01:05:37,387
What the fuck have you done?

848
01:05:37,590 --> 01:05:40,251
It's a goddamn mess,
I'll tell you that.

849
01:05:45,797 --> 01:05:49,527
-What's all this?
-You tell me. They're addressed to you.

850
01:05:50,802 --> 01:05:52,134
Take it.

851
01:06:00,679 --> 01:06:02,170
"Dear Mr. Dufresne:

852
01:06:03,315 --> 01:06:05,284
In response to your inquiries...

853
01:06:05,485 --> 01:06:09,750
...the state has allocated the enclosed
funds for your library project."

854
01:06:10,523 --> 01:06:12,353
This is $200.

855
01:06:12,557 --> 01:06:16,552
"In addition, the library district
has generously responded...

856
01:06:16,762 --> 01:06:19,322
...with a donation of used books
and sundries.

857
01:06:19,532 --> 01:06:23,661
We trust this will fill your needs.
We now consider the matter closed.

858
01:06:23,869 --> 01:06:25,666
Please stop sending us letters."

859
01:06:25,903 --> 01:06:28,567
Clear all this out
before the warden gets back.

860
01:06:28,806 --> 01:06:29,967
Yes, sir.

861
01:06:34,246 --> 01:06:35,407
Good for you, Andy.

862
01:06:38,384 --> 01:06:39,509
Wow!

863
01:06:40,719 --> 01:06:42,652
It only took six years.

864
01:06:44,222 --> 01:06:46,952
From now on, I'll write two
letters a week instead of one.

865
01:06:47,159 --> 01:06:50,492
I believe you're crazy enough.
Get this stuff out...

866
01:06:50,762 --> 01:06:51,592
...like he said.

867
01:06:51,797 --> 01:06:53,197
I've got to pinch a loaf.

868
01:06:53,398 --> 01:06:54,864
When I come back...

869
01:06:55,067 --> 01:06:56,831
...this is all gone, all right?

870
01:07:45,585 --> 01:07:46,983
Do you hear that?

871
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:56,881
Dufresne!

872
01:08:59,423 --> 01:09:00,948
Andy, let me out!

873
01:09:07,832 --> 01:09:12,770
I have no idea to this day what those
two Italian ladies were singing about.

874
01:09:13,072 --> 01:09:15,301
Truth is, I don't want to know.

875
01:09:15,506 --> 01:09:17,997
Some things are best left unsaid.

876
01:09:21,581 --> 01:09:24,310
I like to think it was something
so beautiful...

877
01:09:24,515 --> 01:09:26,644
...it can't be expressed in words...

878
01:09:26,853 --> 01:09:29,752
...and makes your heart ache
because of it.

879
01:09:31,422 --> 01:09:33,913
I tell you, those voices soared...

880
01:09:34,193 --> 01:09:38,493
...higher and farther than anybody
in a gray place dares to dream.

881
01:09:38,698 --> 01:09:42,064
It was like a beautiful bird
flapped into our drab cage...

882
01:09:42,268 --> 01:09:45,032
...and made those walls dissolve away.

883
01:09:45,470 --> 01:09:47,666
And for the briefest of moments...

884
01:09:47,872 --> 01:09:50,864
...every last man at Shawshank
felt free.

885
01:09:53,444 --> 01:09:56,108
It pissed the warden off
something awful.

886
01:09:57,416 --> 01:09:58,404
Open the door.

887
01:10:01,319 --> 01:10:03,082
Open it up!

888
01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:07,118
Dufresne, open this door!

889
01:10:08,461 --> 01:10:09,654
Turn that off!

890
01:10:16,734 --> 01:10:19,170
I am warning you. Turn that off!
