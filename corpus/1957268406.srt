- You did good.

206
00:11:43,398 --> 00:11:46,314
 Officer said there
 was four of 'em.

207
00:11:49,012 --> 00:11:49,883
 You defended yourself.

208
00:11:49,926 --> 00:11:51,058
- Stop.
- What?

209
00:11:53,103 --> 00:11:55,192
 Come on, it's not like you
 killed them, they deserved it.

210
00:11:55,236 --> 00:11:57,325
 - That's not what the
 police report says.

211
00:11:57,368 --> 00:12:00,328
 It's their word, four
 of them, against mine.

212
00:12:00,371 --> 00:12:01,111
 - Doesn't matter.

213
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:02,591
- Yeah, it does.

214
00:12:02,634 --> 00:12:04,375
 I used a sleeper
 hold on one of them.

215
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:06,769
 I could've killed him
 and it's your fault.

216
00:12:06,813 --> 00:12:08,292
 - I mean, what if you didn't
 know how to defend yourself?

217
00:12:08,336 --> 00:12:09,337
 - Dad, stop.

218
00:12:10,207 --> 00:12:11,774
 Stop.

219
00:12:11,818 --> 00:12:13,776
 I didn't just defend
 myself, I'm the freak

220
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,473
 who leveled four guys
 without a scratch.

221
00:12:15,517 --> 00:12:17,954
 I mean, who does that?

222
00:12:17,998 --> 00:12:21,088
 - I mean, you know
 I'm not mad, right?

223
00:12:21,131 --> 00:12:22,480
 - No.

224
00:12:22,524 --> 00:12:23,786
 You're proud.

225
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,832
 What type of parent are you?

226
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,224
 Oh, and you froze
 my credit cards?

227
00:12:27,268 --> 00:12:28,660
 Did you think that was funny?

228
00:12:28,704 --> 00:12:30,184
 - You've been ignoring
 me for months.

229
00:12:30,227 --> 00:12:32,621
 - I'm having you removed as
 a cosigner on my accounts.

230
00:12:32,664 --> 00:12:33,622
 - I wanted to see you.

231
00:12:33,665 --> 00:12:34,797
 - Now you've seen me.

232
00:12:34,841 --> 00:12:36,320
 Take me back to campus now.

233

 break, you're going home.

- Well, I have studying
I need to catch up on.

235
00:12:39,802 --> 00:12:42,326
 - Oh, yeah, I'm sure.

236
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:45,939
Look, we're going home,
it's been too long.

237
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:48,637

Hey, we're home.

 Hey, you want some cereal?

Yeah, I can go out later
and get some groceries.

you a little something.

273

 - What am I gonna
 do with this? I...

281
00:15:21,398 --> 00:15:26,316
What about clothes or gift
cards, just something practical?

282
00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:29,972

 - Okay, okay, okay.

368
00:24:24,898 --> 00:24:26,987
 Breathe, breathe.

369
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:29,859

 [light dramatic music]

375
00:25:38,449 --> 00:25:41,235
 - [Boy] Oh, he
 means it all right.

376
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:42,453
The dog-
- Dad!

377
00:25:43,498 --> 00:25:44,804
 - What's Grandma's address?

378
00:25:44,847 --> 00:25:45,935
- Again?

379
00:25:45,979 --> 00:25:47,763
- Humor me. What is it?

380
00:25:47,807 --> 00:25:51,637
 - 19 Boarcrest Road in
 Cayhill, wherever that is.

381
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,638
 - You can look it up.

382
00:25:52,681 --> 00:25:53,726
 And what's it for?

383
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:56,250
- Can I finish the show?
- Scarlett.

384
00:25:56,293 --> 00:25:59,558
 - If there's ever an emergency
 you'll tell me to go there.

385
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:00,602
 - That's right, and
 you'll wait for me

386
00:26:00,646 --> 00:26:02,691
 until I get there, right?

387
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:06,129
 - Why do you call
 it that when I don't

388
00:26:06,173 --> 00:26:07,870
 have any grandmothers left?

389
00:26:07,914 --> 00:26:09,611
 - It's exactly why
 I call it that.

390
00:26:09,655 --> 00:26:12,919
 We'll be safe there
 in case we need it.

391
00:26:14,921 --> 00:26:17,532
 - [Boy] Better not
 scare the fish away.

392
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,796
 [light dramatic music]

393
00:26:32,025 --> 00:26:32,852

394
00:26:35,071 --> 00:26:35,898
 Dad?

He's not coming.

410
00:29:00,564 --> 00:29:03,176
[phone beeping]

411
00:29:07,658 --> 00:29:09,530
 - [Cal] Come on, keep up!

412
00:29:09,573 --> 00:29:10,661
 How are you ever
 gonna outrun somebody

413
00:29:10,705 --> 00:29:11,837
 if you get in trouble?

414
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,403
 - [Scarlett] Or I
 could call the police.

415
00:29:13,447 --> 00:29:14,796
 - Hey!

416
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,580
 We talked about that.

417
00:29:16,624 --> 00:29:18,234
 - You know, you're the
 only parent who encourages

418
00:29:18,278 --> 00:29:20,193
their daughter not to dial 911.

419
00:29:20,236 --> 00:29:22,978
 - Okay, well, if you're hurt
 or if there's a fire, yes,

420
00:29:23,022 --> 00:29:25,502
 call them, but if it's
 another dangerous situation

421
00:29:25,546 --> 00:29:28,027
 just protect yourself
 and get away.

422
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,942
 - Yeah, because you don't
 like the questions like,

423
00:29:29,985 --> 00:29:32,422
 "Hey, Dad, where'd
 you go last week?"

424
00:29:32,466 --> 00:29:33,902
 - You know I can't
 talk about that.

425
00:29:33,946 --> 00:29:35,512
- Yeah, all I'm allowed
to know is you work

426
00:29:35,556 --> 00:29:37,427
 for the government
 and carry a gun.

427
00:29:37,471 --> 00:29:38,864
 Fine.

428
00:29:38,907 --> 00:29:40,387
 How's Syria this time of year?

429
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,736
 - Come on, cut it out.

430
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,911
 - What, you can't
 stop me from watching

431
00:29:42,955 --> 00:29:44,870
 the news and guessing.

432
00:29:44,913 --> 00:29:46,088
 - Scarlett.

433
00:29:46,132 --> 00:29:47,698
 - Okay, I get it.
 Don't call the police.

434
00:29:47,742 --> 00:29:48,569
 Whatever.

435
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,745
 - Good sprint!

452
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,514
 Hello?

453
00:31:47,557 --> 00:31:49,211
 - [Man] You must be Scarlett.

454
00:31:49,255 --> 00:31:50,517
 - Who is this?

455
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,259
 - [Man] I'm the man
 who has your father.

456
00:31:53,302 --> 00:31:54,825
 - I wanna talk to him.

457
00:31:54,869 --> 00:31:56,915
 - [Man] And I bet he's dying
 to talk to you, too, Red.

458
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:58,568
 I'd love to reunite
 the two of you,

459
00:31:58,612 --> 00:32:02,442
so, do me a favor, just
sit tight, all right?

460
00:32:02,485 --> 00:32:04,661
 We'll come pick you up so
 you can see your father.

497
00:34:50,391 --> 00:34:51,393
 Who are you?

498
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:55,614

Where's my dad?

00:35:07,453 --> 00:35:10,673

 - Careful, don't hurt
 yourself with that.

508
00:35:22,207 --> 00:35:23,904
 You won't shoot me.

514
00:35:38,658 --> 00:35:41,878
 Hands up, a little
 more here, okay.

515
00:35:41,922 --> 00:35:44,881
Good. It's a little
more comfortable, right?

516
00:35:44,925 --> 00:35:47,232
Okay, good, you remember
what we talked about?

517
00:35:47,275 --> 00:35:51,888
 Both eyes open at all
 times, aim, breathe evenly,

518
00:35:51,932 --> 00:35:54,543
time your shot with your breath
for better accuracy, right?

519
00:35:54,587 --> 00:35:55,501
- Okay.

520
00:35:55,544 --> 00:35:56,632

 [gun bangs]

524
00:36:13,432 --> 00:36:15,912
- I had plans, you know.

525
00:36:15,956 --> 00:36:17,740
- Guy with a stud in his tongue?

526
00:36:17,784 --> 00:36:19,307
 Who knows where else?

527
00:36:19,351 --> 00:36:21,004
 Come on, that is not plans.

528
00:36:21,048 --> 00:36:22,528
 - Okay, well this?

529
00:36:22,571 --> 00:36:24,486
 This is probably going
 to get me in trouble

530
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:26,227
 just like everything else.

531
00:36:26,271 --> 00:36:29,274
- Okay, but not if you
know what you're doing.

532
00:36:29,317 --> 00:36:32,015
 Come on, this is
 quality bonding time.

533
00:36:32,059 --> 00:36:33,278
 - Okay, well we do
 this a lot more than

534
00:36:33,321 --> 00:36:36,106
 I get to go out and
 do normal things.

535
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:38,544

 [gun bangs]
 [metal clinks]

537
00:36:43,418 --> 00:36:45,942
 Makes me cool dad
 of the year, no?

538
00:36:45,986 --> 00:36:50,295
 - You're way out of touch
 with what I think is cool.

539
00:36:53,298 --> 00:36:54,473
 - Ah, this is great.

540
00:36:54,516 --> 00:36:57,258
 The grouping's fantastic.

541
00:36:57,302 --> 00:36:58,259
 If you keep this up-

542
00:36:58,303 --> 00:36:59,521
 - I don't wanna keep it up,

543
00:36:59,565 --> 00:37:02,785
or keep coming here and
being someone I'm not.

544
00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:05,135
 - Why, stop it, Scarlett.

545
00:37:05,179 --> 00:37:06,441
[Scarlett sighs]

546
00:37:06,485 --> 00:37:08,138
 - Keys, Dad.

547
00:37:08,182 --> 00:37:10,576
 - Hey, I know this
 is unusual for you.

548
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:12,360
 - You think because I can
 shoot at a pinned up target

549
00:37:12,404 --> 00:37:15,145
 I can, what, shoot a person?

550
00:37:15,189 --> 00:37:18,888
 Why would I even want
 to shoot someone?

551
00:37:18,932 --> 00:37:21,804
 - You don't know what you
 might have to do someday.

552
00:37:21,848 --> 00:37:23,806
 - Why do you want this for me?

553
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:26,069
 - [Cal] To keep you safe.

554
00:37:26,113 --> 00:37:27,375
[Scarlett sighs]

555
00:37:27,419 --> 00:37:30,117
- Gee, at least I'm not
locked up in the house,

556
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,814
 get to see sunlight.

557
00:37:33,294 --> 00:37:36,079
 Awesome.
 - Okay, cut it out, Scarlett.

558
00:37:36,123 --> 00:37:37,385
This is not easy for me.

559
00:37:37,429 --> 00:37:38,430
 - What isn't?

560
00:37:38,473 --> 00:37:40,170
 - Raising you.

561
00:37:40,214 --> 00:37:44,131
 Being a father, being
 away, worrying about you.

562
00:37:45,393 --> 00:37:49,223
Look, I wish your mother
was still here, okay?

563
00:37:50,877 --> 00:37:53,053
 But you are stuck with me.

564
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,405
 - No, you worry about me
 but you're gone on and off

565
00:37:57,449 --> 00:37:59,015
 3/4 of the year, so...

566
00:37:59,059 --> 00:38:01,496
 If you're so worried about
 me why don't you just remarry

567
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,977
 or get a girlfriend
 to check in on me?

568
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,848
 - It is too late for that.

569
00:38:05,892 --> 00:38:07,285
 - It's too late
 for a lotta things.

570
00:38:07,328 --> 00:38:09,461
 - Look, I don't trust anyone.

571
00:38:09,504 --> 00:38:10,940
 Okay, not like that.

572
00:38:10,984 --> 00:38:13,813
And I'm not gonna risk bringing
someone into our lives.

573
00:38:13,856 --> 00:38:17,251
 - I thought you were a
 decent judge of character.

574
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,645
 Why don't you just
 quit your job?

575
00:38:19,688 --> 00:38:21,821
I mean, wouldn't that be
better for both of us?

576
00:38:21,864 --> 00:38:24,606
 No more secrets, no more me
 not knowing what you're doing

577
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:26,826
 and you worrying about me.

578
00:38:28,436 --> 00:38:30,438
- I'm good at what I do.

579
00:38:31,526 --> 00:38:33,223
 Someone's gotta do it.

580
00:38:33,267 --> 00:38:36,357
 - So let someone else do it.

581
00:38:36,401 --> 00:38:37,663
 - Well, no matter what
 I do I'm not gonna

582
00:38:37,706 --> 00:38:39,708
stop worrying about you.

583
00:38:41,101 --> 00:38:43,364
 I'll drive. Get in the car.

584
00:38:45,888 --> 00:38:49,631
 [dramatic whooshing]

585
00:38:49,675 --> 00:38:52,939
 [light dramatic music]

586
00:38:55,594 --> 00:38:57,291
 - [McDowell] Get up.

587
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,860
 [man groans]

588
00:39:00,903 --> 00:39:02,296
 - Where's Walker?

589
00:39:03,819 --> 00:39:05,081
 [man sighs]

590
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:05,952
 Sweet.

591
00:39:07,562 --> 00:39:08,737
 [phone beeps]

592
00:39:08,781 --> 00:39:10,217
[phone ringing]

593
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,045
 - [Man] The girl?

594
00:39:12,088 --> 00:39:13,176
- She got away.

595
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,048
 - [Man] Interesting.

596
00:39:15,091 --> 00:39:16,397
- Walker's dead.

597
00:39:17,442 --> 00:39:19,313
- [Man] You underestimated her.

598
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,663
 Get back here, I
 have another option.

599
00:39:21,707 --> 00:39:22,534
- Okay.

600
00:39:24,231 --> 00:39:26,102
 [man sighs]

601
00:39:26,146 --> 00:39:27,930
- Help me with the body.

602
00:39:27,974 --> 00:39:29,105
 [suspenseful music]

603
00:39:29,149 --> 00:39:31,978
 [engine rumbling]

604
00:39:36,025 --> 00:39:39,333
 [light dramatic music]

605
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:43,206
 [engine rumbling]

606
00:39:46,993 --> 00:39:50,300
 [light dramatic music]

607
00:39:58,483 --> 00:40:00,615
 - [Cal] How do you tell when
 someone's following you?

608
00:40:00,659 --> 00:40:01,877
- What?

609
00:40:01,921 --> 00:40:03,575
 - How do you tell?

610
00:40:03,618 --> 00:40:05,098
- Dad, not now.

611
00:40:05,141 --> 00:40:06,621
 - Come on, you
 check your mirrors.

612
00:40:06,665 --> 00:40:10,016
If you see the same car they're
gonna turn when you turn.

613
00:40:10,059 --> 00:40:12,018
 - We are just going
 out to dinner.

614
00:40:12,061 --> 00:40:14,194
 - And they'll try
 and match your speed.

615
00:40:14,237 --> 00:40:16,718
- I'm a little old for
a driving lesson, okay?

616
00:40:16,762 --> 00:40:17,893
 - This is important.

617
00:40:17,937 --> 00:40:20,548
 - That's what you always say.

618
00:40:20,592 --> 00:40:22,158
 - Come on, what if you
 have a stalker boyfriend.

619
00:40:22,202 --> 00:40:24,291
 How you gonna tell
 if he follows you?

620
00:40:24,334 --> 00:40:26,902
- Should've just ordered pizza.

621
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,339
[dramatic music]

622
00:40:29,383 --> 00:40:32,604
 [light dramatic music]

623
00:40:38,174 --> 00:40:41,308
 Follow too closely
 and you'll be seen.

624
00:40:44,137 --> 00:40:49,098
 [engine rumbling]
 [light dramatic music]

625
00:41:03,548 --> 00:41:07,726
 Just because he speeds up,
 doesn't mean I have to.

626
00:41:13,383 --> 00:41:16,691
If he speeds up
suddenly, he spotted me.

627
00:41:23,611 --> 00:41:26,484
 [engine rumbling]

628
00:41:29,661 --> 00:41:31,880

 [body thuds]

644
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,447
- Sanches, is that you?

645
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:02,797
Sanches?

646
00:43:04,364 --> 00:43:05,583
Dawson?

647
00:43:05,626 --> 00:43:08,324
 - [Man] Garza, go
 check that out.

648
00:43:08,368 --> 00:43:11,371
 [suspenseful music]

649
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:29,389

[man groaning]
[fist thudding]

656
00:43:53,152 --> 00:43:57,722
 [heavy breathing]
 [suspenseful music]

657
00:44:02,944 --> 00:44:05,686
 [heavy breathing]

658
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:09,429
 - [Oloski] You'll tell
 me one way or another.

659
00:44:11,126 --> 00:44:12,780
 Where did he put it?

660
00:44:13,781 --> 00:44:16,262
- [Man] I don't... I don't know.

661
00:44:16,305 --> 00:44:19,439
 Please, I told you
 everything I know.

662
00:44:21,571 --> 00:44:24,400
 - [Oloski] It's just
 not good enough.

663
00:44:24,444 --> 00:44:27,752
Let's see if you can
remember anything else.

664
00:44:27,795 --> 00:44:29,405
 - [Man] No, no, no, come on.

665
00:44:29,449 --> 00:44:30,624
 - [Oloski] Where's the vial?

666
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,017
 - I don't know.
 - The cetus virus.

667
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,583
 - [Man] I don't know.

668
00:44:33,627 --> 00:44:34,715
 I don't know.

669
00:44:34,759 --> 00:44:35,847
 - [Oloski] Serious question.

670
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:37,065
 - [Man] What?

671
00:44:37,109 --> 00:44:38,371
 - [Oloski] How well
 can you tolerate pain?

672
00:44:38,414 --> 00:44:41,069
[man screaming]

673
00:44:42,636 --> 00:44:45,073
- Stop!
[dramatic music]

674
00:44:45,117 --> 00:44:46,161
 Put the gun down.

675
00:44:46,205 --> 00:44:47,728
 Put it down, both of you.

676
00:44:47,772 --> 00:44:48,598
 You, too.

677
00:44:49,991 --> 00:44:51,123
Back up.

678
00:44:51,166 --> 00:44:51,993
Back up!

679
00:44:54,517 --> 00:44:55,780
- Are you lost?

680
00:44:56,781 --> 00:44:57,738
 - Dad?

681
00:44:57,782 --> 00:44:58,826
 - Dad?

[dramatic music]
[man panting]

683
00:45:00,654 --> 00:45:02,003
 Is that your dad?

684
00:45:04,266 --> 00:45:05,790
 [light dramatic music]

685
00:45:05,833 --> 00:45:06,878
 - Let him go.

686
00:45:06,921 --> 00:45:08,706
 - Yeah, yeah do that.

687
00:45:10,664 --> 00:45:11,621

[Oloski groans]
[dramatic music]

689
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,408
 - Don't move.

690
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:17,584
 Don't move.

691
00:45:20,152 --> 00:45:21,240
 - Who are you?

692
00:45:21,283 --> 00:45:22,807
 - Where's my dad?
 - What?

693
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:24,199
- Cal, his name is Cal.

694
00:45:24,243 --> 00:45:25,548
- Hey, look out.
[gun banging]

695
00:45:25,592 --> 00:45:27,550
- Move!
[dramatic music]

696
00:45:27,594 --> 00:45:30,423
 Go!
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

697
00:45:30,466 --> 00:45:31,685

 [heavy breathing]

701
00:45:46,656 --> 00:45:47,527
 - Now what?

702
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:48,789
 - I'm still figuring it out.

703
00:45:48,833 --> 00:45:51,836
 - What do you mean
 figuring it out?

704
00:45:51,879 --> 00:45:53,054
 What kind of rescue is this?

705
00:45:53,098 --> 00:45:54,664
 - I wasn't planning
 on rescuing you.

706
00:45:54,708 --> 00:45:59,713
[gun banging]
[dramatic music]

707
00:46:01,367 --> 00:46:04,370
 [suspenseful music]

708
00:46:16,164 --> 00:46:17,818
- They're still on the property.

709
00:46:17,862 --> 00:46:18,732
 Find 'em.

710
00:46:20,255 --> 00:46:23,476
 - Here, here, passenger side.

711
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:28,524
 [door thudding]
 [engine rumbling]

712
00:46:29,221 --> 00:46:31,484
 [heavy breathing]

713
00:46:32,528 --> 00:46:33,616
 - Hey, thanks for the uh-

714
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:34,835
- Yeah.

715
00:46:34,879 --> 00:46:37,664
 - You know, the
 saving me and stuff.

716
00:46:40,058 --> 00:46:41,799
 I'm Sean, by the way.

717
00:46:41,842 --> 00:46:42,843
 - Scarlett.

718
00:46:42,887 --> 00:46:44,540
- Hey, Scarlett.

719
00:46:44,584 --> 00:46:47,152
 Hey, is Cal your dad?

720
00:46:47,195 --> 00:46:48,066
 - Have you seen him?

721
00:46:48,109 --> 00:46:50,633
- No, no, he's just, no, nuh uh.

722
00:46:50,677 --> 00:46:52,548
 I think they have him
 in maybe another place

723
00:46:52,592 --> 00:46:53,375
 or something.
 - Where?

724
00:46:53,419 --> 00:46:54,289
- I don't know.

725
00:46:54,333 --> 00:46:55,813
 - You must!
 - No.

726
00:46:55,856 --> 00:46:57,815
 No, I don't know where he's
 at, I haven't heard anything.

727
00:46:57,858 --> 00:46:58,685
 Sorry.

728
00:46:59,686 --> 00:47:01,209
Yeah, I just...

729
00:47:01,253 --> 00:47:05,518
 I think the bleeding's
 slowing down, but it stings.

730
00:47:07,607 --> 00:47:08,564
 - You okay?

731
00:47:09,739 --> 00:47:10,610
- I don't know.

732
00:47:10,653 --> 00:47:12,917
 Yeah, I'm sure I'll be fine.

733
00:47:14,222 --> 00:47:17,486
 [light dramatic music]

734
00:47:20,315 --> 00:47:21,751
 [Sean groans]

735
00:47:21,795 --> 00:47:22,840
 Nice.

736
00:47:22,883 --> 00:47:24,972
 [bag rustling]

737
00:47:25,016 --> 00:47:25,843
- Here.

738
00:47:26,756 --> 00:47:28,062
Start with this.

739
00:47:29,759 --> 00:47:30,586
 - Thanks.

740
00:47:33,198 --> 00:47:35,417
 - How do you know my dad?

741
00:47:35,461 --> 00:47:36,854
 - I got him some information.

742
00:47:36,897 --> 00:47:38,290
 - [Scarlett] How?

743
00:47:39,508 --> 00:47:40,858
 - Some illegal ways
 that may or may not

744
00:47:40,901 --> 00:47:43,817
 have involved code
 on the internet.

745
00:47:44,949 --> 00:47:47,212
 You know what he does, right?

746
00:47:47,255 --> 00:47:49,605
- Yeah, I have an idea.

747
00:47:49,649 --> 00:47:51,085
 - Well, I got him
 some information about

748
00:47:51,129 --> 00:47:55,263
 a biological weapon that
 was being sold as a virus.

749
00:47:56,438 --> 00:47:58,571
 Something those guys
 called this weird name

750
00:47:58,614 --> 00:48:00,094
like Cetus or something.

751
00:48:00,138 --> 00:48:01,835
 Anyway, Cal went after it.

752
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:03,837
- So what are you, an informant?

753
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,621
[Sean chuckles]

754
00:48:05,665 --> 00:48:07,841
 - Something like that.

755
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:10,017
 - And those guys?

756
00:48:10,061 --> 00:48:12,628
- Guessing arms dealers.

757
00:48:12,672 --> 00:48:14,935
 - And how did they get to you?

758
00:48:14,979 --> 00:48:16,110
- I don't know.

759
00:48:16,154 --> 00:48:17,416
One moment I'm chilling
drinking a coffee

760
00:48:17,459 --> 00:48:20,245
 and the next they
 grabbed me and...

761
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:23,857
 You're the last person I
 expected to show up, though.

762
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:25,250
 You know?

763
00:48:25,293 --> 00:48:26,468
 - Who were you expecting?

764
00:48:26,512 --> 00:48:27,905
 [Sean groans]

765
00:48:27,948 --> 00:48:30,168
- I don't know, maybe
some of Cal's associates

766
00:48:30,211 --> 00:48:32,735
 or another agent or something.

767
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:37,131
 Actually, I wasn't expecting
 them to take him down.

768
00:48:37,175 --> 00:48:38,611
 - What do you mean?

769
00:48:38,654 --> 00:48:42,658
 - I mean, I don't mean
 down, I mean find him.

770
00:48:42,702 --> 00:48:43,964
I didn't know, I passed
on some information

771
00:48:44,008 --> 00:48:44,965
 that must've been
 enough to track.

772
00:48:45,009 --> 00:48:46,314
 - You told them about my dad?

773
00:48:46,358 --> 00:48:47,315
 - I didn't have a choice.
 - That was you?

774
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,926
 - I didn't have a choice!

775
00:48:48,969 --> 00:48:51,929
 - They came after
 us because of you!

776
00:48:53,017 --> 00:48:54,496
 - I'm sorry, I...

777
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:57,673
 I'm not all trained
 in this sort of thing.

778
00:48:57,717 --> 00:49:00,546
 I'm a little in
 over my head here.

779
00:49:02,026 --> 00:49:05,377
 - You're gonna help
 me get him back.

780
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:06,813
 - Ow, oh!

781
00:49:06,856 --> 00:49:08,771
 Come on.
 - You owe him.

782
00:49:08,815 --> 00:49:10,338
 - I owe him?

783
00:49:10,382 --> 00:49:11,861
 He got me into this.

784
00:49:11,905 --> 00:49:13,298
 - I thought you were the
 one who told him about it.

785
00:49:13,341 --> 00:49:15,517
 Besides, you betrayed him,
 you put him in danger.

786
00:49:15,561 --> 00:49:16,954
 And me, too!

787
00:49:16,997 --> 00:49:18,868
 Now you're gonna
 help me get him back.

788
00:49:18,912 --> 00:49:20,261
 - I hate to break it to you,

789
00:49:20,305 --> 00:49:21,654
 but this intimidation
 thing you do is much better

790
00:49:21,697 --> 00:49:23,264
for your dad than it is for you.

791
00:49:23,308 --> 00:49:26,180
You're holding a 50 cent
bandage over my head.

792
00:49:26,224 --> 00:49:29,401
 Very convincing,
 I've changed my mind!

793
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,231
 [Sean sighs]

794
00:49:34,406 --> 00:49:36,843
 - Here, let me... let me see.

795
00:49:38,323 --> 00:49:39,150
 All right.

796
00:49:41,195 --> 00:49:42,153
 It's not that deep.

797
00:49:42,196 --> 00:49:43,371
 - [Sean] It's not?

798
00:49:43,415 --> 00:49:44,242
 - No.

799
00:49:46,244 --> 00:49:47,767
All right, just apply pressure.

800
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:48,942
 Yep, right there.

801
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,248
- Okay, thanks.

802
00:49:52,163 --> 00:49:54,078
 [light dramatic music]

803
00:49:54,121 --> 00:49:56,254
 - Did you see him at all?

804
00:49:58,865 --> 00:49:59,692
 - No.

805
00:50:04,175 --> 00:50:07,874
He's tough, though,
he'll survive, you know?

806
00:50:10,485 --> 00:50:13,097
 - I'm the only one
 looking for him.

807
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:18,145
 [light dramatic music]
 [birds chirping]

808
00:50:24,717 --> 00:50:26,893
 Train station is up ahead.

809
00:50:28,286 --> 00:50:32,899
 - Yeah, it's good, you can
 just drop me off right there.

810
00:50:32,942 --> 00:50:35,771
 [engine rumbling]

811
00:50:35,815 --> 00:50:38,339
 [brakes squeaking]

812
00:50:38,383 --> 00:50:39,166
- Here.

813
00:50:41,647 --> 00:50:44,954
 This might not draw as
 much attention as...

814
00:50:44,998 --> 00:50:47,348
 - [chuckles] Yeah, thanks.

815
00:50:47,392 --> 00:50:48,175
 - Yep.

816
00:50:49,959 --> 00:50:52,614
 - You know, you should run.

817
00:50:52,658 --> 00:50:53,833
 I would, I am.

818
00:50:55,139 --> 00:50:56,879
 - That's your choice.

819
00:50:58,533 --> 00:50:59,578
 - Yeah, okay.

820
00:51:01,536 --> 00:51:04,974
 You know, maybe this
 virus thing these guys

821
00:51:05,018 --> 00:51:06,454
 are looking for is the
 thing that Cal has.

822
00:51:06,498 --> 00:51:08,456
 Maybe it's your ticket
 outta here, you know?

823
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:11,372
 You find it and trade
 it for him and...

824
00:51:11,416 --> 00:51:13,200
 - Unless it's labeled
 deadly virus I don't know

825
00:51:13,244 --> 00:51:14,593
 what I'm looking for.

826
00:51:14,636 --> 00:51:15,985
 Besides, if it's
 that big of a deal-

827
00:51:16,029 --> 00:51:18,814
[sirens wailing]

828
00:51:20,468 --> 00:51:22,818
[Scarlett sighs]

829
00:51:22,862 --> 00:51:25,256
 - How are you gonna find Cal?

830
00:51:26,561 --> 00:51:28,302
 - I'll figure it out.

831
00:51:29,608 --> 00:51:31,436
- Look, if I had any information
I would totally help-

832
00:51:31,479 --> 00:51:32,872
 - It's fine.

833
00:51:32,915 --> 00:51:34,395
 It's fine, I get it.

834
00:51:34,439 --> 00:51:37,920
 - I mean, I owe you one,
 you know, for everything.

835
00:51:37,964 --> 00:51:39,879
- Don't worry about it.

836
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:43,665
- [sighs] Okay.

837
00:51:49,323 --> 00:51:52,109
 [light music]

838
00:51:52,152 --> 00:51:54,154
 [door thuds]

839
00:51:54,198 --> 00:51:55,242
 [Sean sighs]

840
00:51:55,286 --> 00:51:57,679
[head thudding]

841
00:51:57,723 --> 00:51:59,072
I must be crazy.

842
00:52:03,076 --> 00:52:06,732
[light music]
[birds chirping]

843
00:52:06,775 --> 00:52:09,517
[door squeaking]

844
00:52:12,085 --> 00:52:13,478
 [bag rustling]

845
00:52:13,521 --> 00:52:14,957
 Safe house, nice.

846
00:52:16,263 --> 00:52:18,135
 - Something like that.

847
00:52:19,962 --> 00:52:22,617
- He has got everything.

848
00:52:22,661 --> 00:52:24,750
 Whoa, are those grenades?

849
00:52:26,839 --> 00:52:29,755
Hey, has he been here recently?

850
00:52:29,798 --> 00:52:31,017
- I don't know.

851
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:32,888
 - Well, maybe it's
 here, did you check?

852
00:52:32,932 --> 00:52:35,239
- Wouldn't he of handed
it off to somebody else?

853
00:52:35,282 --> 00:52:37,937
 - [Sean] Well, it depends.
 Let's look around.

854
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:39,112
 - It's a biological weapon,

855
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:41,114
 I have no idea
 where he'd store it.

856
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:42,898
- Well, those guys were
asking a lot about Cal,

857
00:52:42,942 --> 00:52:44,204
 how well I knew him.

858
00:52:44,248 --> 00:52:45,771
 They talked like he
 knew where it was.

859
00:52:45,814 --> 00:52:47,903
 For some reason they think
 he still has it somewhere.

860
00:52:47,947 --> 00:52:51,994
 - Well, it doesn't do me
 any good if I can't find it.

861
00:52:52,038 --> 00:52:53,257
 - Well, I can help you look.

862
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:56,956
 I mean, it's cool. We
 can find it together.

863
00:52:56,999 --> 00:52:58,566
 - Okay.
 - All right.

864
00:53:01,656 --> 00:53:06,661
[light music]
[fire sizzling]

865
00:53:12,232 --> 00:53:14,060
 Your dad's got issues.

866
00:53:18,499 --> 00:53:21,372
 [book thuds]
 Ooh.

867
00:53:21,415 --> 00:53:23,374
 I am willing to open
 this up just to see

868
00:53:23,417 --> 00:53:26,246
if Cal stashed anything inside.

869
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:27,943
 - We don't have time for that.

870
00:53:27,987 --> 00:53:29,249
 - Yeah, we do.

871
00:53:29,293 --> 00:53:31,251
I need food. I haven't
eaten for like two days.

872
00:53:31,295 --> 00:53:32,644
 Here.

873
00:53:32,687 --> 00:53:34,385
- My dad is missing and-

874
00:53:34,428 --> 00:53:35,255
 - Eat.

875
00:53:40,826 --> 00:53:42,871
 So, you work for your dad?

876
00:53:42,915 --> 00:53:43,742
 - No.

877
00:53:44,917 --> 00:53:46,135
 - You just know how
 to handle yourself

878
00:53:46,179 --> 00:53:48,399
 in case a date gets
 handsy or something?

879
00:53:48,442 --> 00:53:50,879
 - My weekends were different
 than most growing up.

880
00:53:50,923 --> 00:53:52,359
 [dramatic whooshing]

881
00:53:52,403 --> 00:53:54,143
 [fists thudding]
 [Scarlett grunting]

882
00:53:54,187 --> 00:53:55,449
 - [Cal] Tired?

883
00:53:55,493 --> 00:53:57,016
 - No.

884
00:53:57,059 --> 00:53:58,409
 - You're lagging.

885
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:01,238
 Excellent, that's it.

886
00:54:02,326 --> 00:54:05,720
Come on.
[fists thudding]

887
00:54:07,679 --> 00:54:09,637
 [Scarlett grunting]
 Come on.

888
00:54:09,681 --> 00:54:11,378
 Good, good, keep
 it up. That's it!

889
00:54:11,422 --> 00:54:12,379
 Come on, one more of them.

890
00:54:12,423 --> 00:54:14,642
 - Take it back, I am tired.

891
00:54:14,686 --> 00:54:15,600
[Scarlett sighs]

892
00:54:15,643 --> 00:54:17,950
 - Come on, five more minutes.

893
00:54:18,951 --> 00:54:19,952
Come on.

894
00:54:19,995 --> 00:54:22,781
- [sighs] Okay.

895
00:54:22,824 --> 00:54:25,131
 - What's on your mind, huh?

896
00:54:25,174 --> 00:54:27,351
 - Nothing.
 - Humor me.

897
00:54:27,394 --> 00:54:28,787
[fist thudding]

898
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:30,354
 What is it?

899
00:54:30,397 --> 00:54:32,791
 [fist thudding]
 [Scarlett grunting]

900
00:54:32,834 --> 00:54:35,359
- Have you ever killed someone?

901
00:54:35,402 --> 00:54:37,578
 - I can't talk about that.

902
00:54:39,363 --> 00:54:40,712
 - It figures.

903
00:54:40,755 --> 00:54:41,669
[fist thudding]

904
00:54:41,713 --> 00:54:43,018
- Why do you wanna know?

905
00:54:43,062 --> 00:54:44,585
 - I think I should, don't you?

906
00:54:44,629 --> 00:54:46,544
I mean, what are you
always training me for?

907
00:54:46,587 --> 00:54:47,936
 - Not to kill.

908
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:48,807
 - Really?

909
00:54:49,721 --> 00:54:51,157
 [Cal sighs]

910
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:54,726
- When it comes down to
it, of course I want it

911
00:54:54,769 --> 00:54:59,774
 to be the other guy, but
 this is for your protection.

912
00:55:00,253 --> 00:55:00,819
- Right.

913
00:55:01,776 --> 00:55:03,212
 - [Cal] Good, good.

914
00:55:03,256 --> 00:55:04,301
 - You haven't
 answered my question.

915
00:55:04,344 --> 00:55:08,348
- Well.

 [light dramatic music]
 [Scarlett grunting]

917
00:55:10,959 --> 00:55:12,787
 Control, control.

918
00:55:12,831 --> 00:55:15,573
 Hey, hey, hey. Calm down!

919
00:55:15,616 --> 00:55:18,445
 [heavy breathing]

920
00:55:24,364 --> 00:55:25,800
 Yes.

921
00:55:25,844 --> 00:55:28,325
 [light music]

922
00:55:29,413 --> 00:55:30,327
 - How many?

923
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,242
- I won't tell you that.

924
00:55:37,856 --> 00:55:39,858
- Doesn't it bother you?

925
00:55:43,078 --> 00:55:45,298
 - Not as much as it should.

926
00:55:46,647 --> 00:55:49,781
 [dramatic whooshing]

927
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,176
 - Your dad never
 told me about you.

928
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:56,657
 - I didn't think
 you two were close.

929
00:55:56,701 --> 00:56:00,966
 Besides, isn't everything
 super secret all the time?

930
00:56:05,318 --> 00:56:07,755
 - So it's just the two of you?

931
00:56:07,799 --> 00:56:09,975
- My mom died when I was eight.

932
00:56:10,018 --> 00:56:11,193
 - [Sean] From his job?

933
00:56:11,237 --> 00:56:12,760
 - What? No.

934
00:56:12,804 --> 00:56:14,588
 She got sick.

935
00:56:14,632 --> 00:56:16,285
 - So he raised you.

936
00:56:17,678 --> 00:56:19,506
 - If you call it that.

937
00:56:22,988 --> 00:56:24,250
What about you?

938
00:56:24,293 --> 00:56:26,121
- What about me?

939
00:56:26,165 --> 00:56:28,080
 - Well, I know
 nothing about you.

940
00:56:28,123 --> 00:56:31,562
 Other than you've
 worked with my dad.

941
00:56:31,605 --> 00:56:36,131
 - Well, I grew up under less
 than ideal circumstances.

942
00:56:37,481 --> 00:56:38,873
 Had a few run ins with the law

943
00:56:38,917 --> 00:56:43,443
 'cause of my computer skills,
 but I turned out okay.

944
00:56:44,488 --> 00:56:46,359
 Pretty good at
 gettin' outta scrapes.

945
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:48,492
 [chuckles] Well, I
 mean, everybody's

946
00:56:48,535 --> 00:56:50,711
 got their off day, right?

947
00:56:50,755 --> 00:56:54,498
 I'm more of a
 information middleman.

948
00:56:54,541 --> 00:56:56,848
It's how I met your dad.

949
00:56:56,891 --> 00:56:59,720
 I thought it would
 be a safer gig.

950
00:57:01,853 --> 00:57:06,031
 [light dramatic music]
 [birds chirping]

951
00:57:06,074 --> 00:57:08,381
 [rustling]

952
00:57:10,209 --> 00:57:11,340
 Whatcha doin'?

953
00:57:11,384 --> 00:57:13,038
 - I'm making a deal.

954
00:57:14,692 --> 00:57:17,172
I'm telling them we'll
get them what they want.

955
00:57:17,216 --> 00:57:18,870
 My dad for the vial.

956
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:20,872
[phone clicking]

957
00:57:20,915 --> 00:57:23,222
 Or I'm going to the police.

958
00:57:26,399 --> 00:57:29,054
 [phone dings]

959
00:57:29,097 --> 00:57:30,447
- What's it say?

960
00:57:31,317 --> 00:57:33,188
- You have until tomorrow night

961
00:57:33,232 --> 00:57:37,454
 or we're dropping off
 his body for the cops.

962
00:57:37,497 --> 00:57:40,065
 [light dramatic music]

963
00:57:40,108 --> 00:57:41,022
 [engine rumbling]

964
00:57:41,066 --> 00:57:42,720
 - Were you expecting somebody?

965
00:57:42,763 --> 00:57:45,287
 [suspenseful music]

966
00:57:45,331 --> 00:57:48,160
 - That car, it was
 outside the house.

967
00:57:48,203 --> 00:57:49,640
 - It's them, it's gotta be.

968
00:57:49,683 --> 00:57:52,469
[dramatic music]

00:57:58,605 --> 00:58:02,304

Finger off the trigger.

971
00:58:03,305 --> 00:58:04,698
- Right.

972
00:58:04,742 --> 00:58:06,439
 - Don't point it at my face!
 - I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

973
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:07,701
Oh, god.

974
00:58:07,745 --> 00:58:08,397
 What do we do, what do
 we do, what do we do?

975
00:58:08,441 --> 00:58:09,050
 - Shut up!

976
00:58:09,094 --> 00:58:11,836

 - Freeze, don't move!
 [gun clicks]

981
00:58:33,597 --> 00:58:35,381
 Right there behind the couch.

982
00:58:35,424 --> 00:58:36,861
 - I see 'em!

983
00:58:36,904 --> 00:58:39,559
 - Drop the gun, put your
 hands where I can see 'em.

984
00:58:39,603 --> 00:58:40,560
- What do we do?

985
00:58:40,604 --> 00:58:41,648
 - [Man] Let me see your hands!

986
00:58:41,692 --> 00:58:43,084
 - Put it down.
 - Show me your hands!

987
00:58:43,128 --> 00:58:44,303
 - Come on!
 - Put the gun down!

988
00:58:44,346 --> 00:58:47,567
 I'm not gonna tell you
 again. Put it down!

989
00:58:47,611 --> 00:58:52,267
 - Okay, okay, okay.
 [suspenseful music]

00:59:01,276 --> 00:59:02,364
 - Get down.
 [guns banging]

993
00:59:02,408 --> 00:59:06,760
- Take cover, now, now!
[dramatic music]

994
00:59:07,892 --> 00:59:12,505
- Come on, out the back!
[guns banging]

995
00:59:14,986 --> 00:59:16,988
Don't stop, keep moving.

996
00:59:21,209 --> 00:59:22,776
 Get down, get down.

997
00:59:24,125 --> 00:59:26,606
 [gun banging]

998
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:28,521

 [heavy breathing]

1005
01:00:00,161 --> 01:00:02,076
 - You okay? You all right?

1006
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:03,382
- I don't know.

1007
01:00:04,557 --> 01:00:06,820
- Oh jeez, you're hurt.

1008
01:00:06,864 --> 01:00:08,169
Hold on.

1009
01:00:08,213 --> 01:00:09,040
Hold on.

1010
01:00:09,954 --> 01:00:11,956
Here, here, put this on.

1011
01:00:13,218 --> 01:00:15,394
Yeah.
- Who were they?

1012
01:00:15,437 --> 01:00:17,309
 - Those are the guys
 who got your dad.

1013
01:00:17,352 --> 01:00:18,832
- How did they find us?

1014
01:00:18,876 --> 01:00:21,182
I mean, I told them I'd
get them what they want

1015
01:00:21,226 --> 01:00:23,402
 and then, and then
 they attacked.

1016
01:00:23,445 --> 01:00:25,578
 Does... does that mean
 they killed my dad?

1017
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:27,536
- No, no, no, don't think that.

1018
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:30,409
 [heavy breathing]

1019
01:00:35,153 --> 01:00:36,676
 - Those men.

1020
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:40,201
 Those men are dead.
 [somber music]

1021
01:00:40,245 --> 01:00:41,420
 - [Sean] Yeah.

1022
01:00:42,726 --> 01:00:44,205
 - Pull over.

1023
01:00:44,249 --> 01:00:46,077
 Pull over.
 - Okay, okay, hold on.

1024
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:48,906
 [engine rumbling]

1025
01:00:51,125 --> 01:00:53,867
[Scarlett pukes]

1026
01:00:56,435 --> 01:00:58,480
 [somber music]

1027
01:00:58,524 --> 01:01:00,352
- I got you, I got you.

1028
01:01:01,309 --> 01:01:02,397
 You okay?

1029
01:01:02,441 --> 01:01:03,442
- Okay.
- Oh.

1030
01:01:05,183 --> 01:01:06,706
Listen, listen, listen, listen.

1031
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:07,838
[Scarlett cries]
You did exactly

1032
01:01:07,881 --> 01:01:09,709
 what you were supposed to do.

1033
01:01:09,753 --> 01:01:12,233
 Those guys were gonna kill us.

1034
01:01:12,277 --> 01:01:13,626
 - I know.
 - Yeah.

1035
01:01:14,801 --> 01:01:16,977
 You know what else?

1036
01:01:17,021 --> 01:01:20,198
 You did what Cal
 would want you to do.

1037
01:01:21,547 --> 01:01:22,679
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1038
01:01:27,771 --> 01:01:28,989
 You know what?

1039
01:01:29,033 --> 01:01:31,165
 He saved my life
 actually one time.

1040
01:01:31,209 --> 01:01:31,992
 - He did?

1041
01:01:32,036 --> 01:01:33,602
- Yeah.

1042
01:01:33,646 --> 01:01:34,473
 Yeah.

1043
01:01:35,866 --> 01:01:39,478
 I was in Dublin and I was
 supposed to meet these guys

1044
01:01:39,521 --> 01:01:41,741
 who ended up not being who I
 thought they were gonna be.

1045
01:01:41,785 --> 01:01:44,918
 I figured that out
 a little too late.

1046
01:01:44,962 --> 01:01:47,529
And I got away, but I got shot.

1047
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:52,447
So, there I am, I'm on the run.

1048
01:01:52,491 --> 01:01:56,321
 I literally have no idea what
 I'm doing, so I call Cal.

1049
01:01:56,364 --> 01:01:58,453
 I didn't expect him to
 pick up or to do anything

1050
01:01:58,497 --> 01:02:00,847
 but I was running out
 of options, right?

1051
01:02:00,891 --> 01:02:01,979
But I remember one time
he told me, he said,

1052
01:02:02,022 --> 01:02:03,763
"I owe you one."

1053
01:02:03,807 --> 01:02:06,940
 So that was me hoping
 he'd come through.

1054
01:02:06,984 --> 01:02:07,898
 And he did.

1055
01:02:10,422 --> 01:02:11,728
- What happened?

1056
01:02:12,903 --> 01:02:16,950
 - So, he tracked me
 down and I'm literally

1057
01:02:16,994 --> 01:02:19,648
on the stone floor of
this old chapel, right?

1058
01:02:19,692 --> 01:02:21,738
 And I'm looking up at
 the barrel of a gun

1059
01:02:21,781 --> 01:02:25,176
 and I'm thinking to myself,
 "All right, this is it."

1060
01:02:25,219 --> 01:02:28,396
 And then Cal shows
 up and he saves me.

1061
01:02:29,833 --> 01:02:31,312
 And he said it was by
 luck that he was in London

1062
01:02:31,356 --> 01:02:32,749
and he was close enough
he could, you know,

1063
01:02:32,792 --> 01:02:37,536
 get to me before
 they [grunts], right?

1064
01:02:37,579 --> 01:02:40,974
 He didn't have to
 show up, but he did.

1065
01:02:41,018 --> 01:02:44,543
 He patched up and he
 told me I was an idiot

1066
01:02:44,586 --> 01:02:47,154
and then he got me outta there.

1067
01:02:49,069 --> 01:02:49,940
- Yeah.

1068
01:02:49,983 --> 01:02:51,245
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1069
01:02:51,289 --> 01:02:54,814
My dad had a lot of last
minute trips growing up

1070
01:02:54,858 --> 01:02:59,036
 and it was never a good
 time and I never got a say

1071
01:02:59,079 --> 01:03:00,994
in his staying or going.

1072
01:03:02,909 --> 01:03:03,823
 I hated it.

1073
01:03:06,043 --> 01:03:06,870
 But, uh...

1074
01:03:09,394 --> 01:03:11,222
 I'm glad he was there.

1075
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:16,183
 - So you guys weren't close?

1076
01:03:16,227 --> 01:03:17,315
 - Not lately.

1077
01:03:19,534 --> 01:03:20,797
- What changed?

1078
01:03:22,886 --> 01:03:25,018
 - It just got to be too much.

1079
01:03:25,062 --> 01:03:26,411
 [dramatic whooshing]

1080
01:03:26,454 --> 01:03:28,717
 - Look, I got you
 into a great program!

1081
01:03:28,761 --> 01:03:30,632
- Don't act like you're
doing me a favor!

1082
01:03:30,676 --> 01:03:32,809
You stuck me in a
subpar community college

1083
01:03:32,852 --> 01:03:35,289
 that was close to you.

1084
01:03:35,333 --> 01:03:36,508
 - It's a little tricky
 right now, okay?

1085
01:03:36,551 --> 01:03:38,466
I don't want you halfway
across the country!

1086
01:03:38,510 --> 01:03:41,165
 - But that's your
 life, not mine!

1087
01:03:41,208 --> 01:03:43,384
 Do you know how hard
 I worked to get into

1088
01:03:43,428 --> 01:03:44,864

 cramming in a cadaver lab

1090

it up with your job!

1091

 - It's for your own good.

1092
01:03:53,003 --> 01:03:54,004
 - Sure, Dad.

1093
01:03:55,919 --> 01:03:57,921
 Then why not let me
 stay at the university

1094
01:03:57,964 --> 01:04:00,053
that has a great
reputation that I worked

1095
01:04:00,097 --> 01:04:01,228

1096
01:04:01,272 --> 01:04:03,665
 - Because somebody might...

1097
01:04:03,709 --> 01:04:05,624
It's complicated, okay?

1098
01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:09,889
It's just better to keep
a low profile right now.

1099
01:04:09,933 --> 01:04:11,195
- Great.

1100
01:04:11,238 --> 01:04:12,761
 So, you transferred
 me without asking

1101
01:04:12,805 --> 01:04:14,328
 and I don't even get
 to know the reason why

1102

 Well, you told them you're
 looking for it though, right?

1114
01:04:46,447 --> 01:04:48,449
- Then they attacked us.

1115
01:04:48,493 --> 01:04:50,669
 - That's a good point.

1116
01:04:50,712 --> 01:04:53,672
 But they still
 might have your dad.

1143

 it was special.

 - Where is it?

1146

 mean, it was here

1147

 before they attacked, but...

1148
01:06:43,782 --> 01:06:46,045
 Maybe they have it.

1149

 it they wouldn't

1150

 you to find the virus for me.

01:13:24,487 --> 01:13:27,315
 Oh, wait, oh, you didn't know.

1263
01:13:27,359 --> 01:13:28,882
 [laughs] Oh, you didn't know?

1264
01:13:28,925 --> 01:13:32,190
 Yeah, the virus was in the
 knife you gave your daughter.

1265
01:13:32,233 --> 01:13:34,322
How she figured it
out, she's a smart kid.

1266
01:13:34,366 --> 01:13:35,541
Beautiful, too.

1267
01:13:37,064 --> 01:13:39,110
 Let me ask you something.

1268
01:13:39,153 --> 01:13:44,157
 When she gets here, would
 you rather that I kill her

1269
01:13:44,855 --> 01:13:45,812
 or that I keep her?

 - Scarlett.
 [light dramatic music]

1304
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:51,666
 - Dad.

1305
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:54,931
 - You shouldn't of come here.

1306
01:17:57,629 --> 01:17:59,065
 - Red.

1307
01:17:59,109 --> 01:18:01,546
 - Let him go.
 - Where is it?

1308
01:18:01,589 --> 01:18:03,068

[dramatic music]

1313
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:24,525
- Good.

1314
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:27,746
 So, have you figured
 out who those men

1315
01:18:27,790 --> 01:18:29,661
 at the cabin were yet?

1316
01:18:31,402 --> 01:18:34,318
 Hey, don't tell me you
 haven't thought about it.

1317
01:18:34,361 --> 01:18:37,407
 [suspenseful music]

1318
01:18:37,451 --> 01:18:39,758
 'Cause they weren't mine.

1319
01:18:39,802 --> 01:18:41,193
- What?

1320
01:18:41,237 --> 01:18:42,195
 - Yeah, no, I figured
 maybe they were your dad's

1321
01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:44,197
 colleagues or maybe a handler.

1322
01:18:44,241 --> 01:18:46,764

[paper rustling]

1324
01:19:02,912 --> 01:19:04,740
 - Don't listen to him.

1325
01:19:06,306 --> 01:19:07,307
 - But you...

1326
01:19:08,264 --> 01:19:09,353
 - I was what?

1327
01:19:11,007 --> 01:19:12,312
 Good to you?

1328
01:19:12,356 --> 01:19:14,227
 I was, right?

1329
01:19:14,271 --> 01:19:17,100
 We shared some tender moments.

1330
01:19:17,143 --> 01:19:18,362
 I can't help if
 you're that gullible.

1331
01:19:18,405 --> 01:19:20,930
 - Come on, leave her alone.

1332
01:19:20,973 --> 01:19:23,802
- You have it now, so I'm
taking my dad and we're leaving.

1333
01:19:23,846 --> 01:19:25,108
 - Oh, oh, oh.
 [gun clicking]

1334
01:19:25,151 --> 01:19:26,500
 No, I know you are
 not stupid enough

1335
01:19:26,544 --> 01:19:27,850
 to think that's gonna happen.

1336
01:19:27,893 --> 01:19:29,155
- Don't.

1337
01:19:29,199 --> 01:19:30,678
 - Don't what? You
 have no leverage.

1338
01:19:30,722 --> 01:19:32,550

 What was that?

1342
01:19:40,210 --> 01:19:41,472
Go, go, go, go!

1343
01:19:42,559 --> 01:19:44,257
 - [Man] We're on it.

1344
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:46,433
We need to act now fast.

1345
01:19:46,477 --> 01:19:47,695
- [Sean] Where'd that come from?

1346
01:19:47,739 --> 01:19:50,219
- [Man] I think the north side.

1347
01:19:50,263 --> 01:19:52,309
[grenade beeps]

1348
01:19:52,352 --> 01:19:55,702

- That was you?

1353
01:20:12,895 --> 01:20:13,764
 Cute.

1354
01:20:15,898 --> 01:20:16,855
- You could let her go.

1355
01:20:16,898 --> 01:20:18,291
 - Shut up!

1356
01:20:18,335 --> 01:20:19,771
 [suspenseful music]

1357
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:21,077
 Tie 'em up in the other room!

 [heavy breathing]

1360
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:37,223
 - You shouldn't of come here.

1361
01:20:37,267 --> 01:20:39,050
 - And where else was
 I supposed to go?

1362
01:20:39,094 --> 01:20:43,664
 How long was I supposed to
 hide while you were missing?

1363
01:20:45,971 --> 01:20:46,929
 - I'm sorry.

1364
01:20:51,541 --> 01:20:52,891
 - You're hurt.

1365
01:20:52,934 --> 01:20:54,414
 - Oh, don't worry about that.

1366
01:20:54,458 --> 01:20:56,155
 The virus, we can't let him
 walk outta here with it.

1367
01:20:56,199 --> 01:20:57,678
 - I know that.

1368
01:20:57,722 --> 01:20:59,898
 - Okay, well, whoever he
 sells it to is gonna use it.

1369
01:20:59,942 --> 01:21:01,204
 - It's not the cetus virus.

1370
01:21:01,246 --> 01:21:02,553
 - Okay, well,
 whatever it is I can't

1371
01:21:02,596 --> 01:21:04,424
 let him walk-
 - It's not a virus at all.

 [light dramatic music]

1373
01:21:05,643 --> 01:21:06,862

 - Nice job.

1377
01:21:30,494 --> 01:21:32,148
 - Oh, he'll figure it out.

1378
01:21:32,191 --> 01:21:34,280
 - [Cal] Okay, then
 we'd better hurry.

1379
01:21:34,324 --> 01:21:35,629
 Where's the real one?

1380
01:21:35,673 --> 01:21:38,458
 - Somewhere safe for now.

1381
01:21:38,502 --> 01:21:41,940
 We probably don't
 have much time.

1382
01:21:41,984 --> 01:21:44,987
 - What are you doing?
 [both grunting]

1383
01:21:45,030 --> 01:21:46,945
- I have a razor blade.

1384
01:21:46,989 --> 01:21:48,380
 You had one in a
 book at the cabin,

1385
01:21:48,425 --> 01:21:50,688
 that's what gave me the idea.

1386

 [muffled talking]

1387
01:21:54,126 --> 01:21:55,475
They're right outside the door.

1390
01:22:01,655 --> 01:22:02,568
 It's locked.

 [light dramatic music]

1392
01:22:04,702 --> 01:22:06,050
 - [Cal] Scarlett.

1393
01:22:07,531 --> 01:22:10,882
 [Scarlett grunts]

1394
01:22:10,925 --> 01:22:12,188
Gonna hear you.

1395
01:22:15,582 --> 01:22:16,714
 Scarlett.

1396
01:22:16,757 --> 01:22:17,976
 - [Scarlett] We gotta
 get out of here.

1397
01:22:18,020 --> 01:22:21,197
 - Cut me loose, we'll
 figure something out.

1398
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:24,200
 [Scarlett panting]

1399
01:22:25,462 --> 01:22:27,943
 [light music]

1400
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:31,207
Come on.

 [footsteps tapping]

1402
01:22:39,041 --> 01:22:40,781

[phone buzzing]

1404
01:22:45,395 --> 01:22:46,222
 Yeah?

1405
01:22:47,223 --> 01:22:48,702
Yes, I have it.

1406
01:22:48,746 --> 01:22:51,139
 I'm still waiting for the
 first half of the transfer.

1407
01:22:51,183 --> 01:22:54,534
No, I will meet you
when I get confirmation.

1408
01:22:54,577 --> 01:22:57,450
 Fine.
 [phone beeps]

1409
01:22:59,583 --> 01:23:02,889
 - Those men who
 died at the cabin,

1410
01:23:02,934 --> 01:23:04,153
 what Sean said about them.

1411
01:23:04,196 --> 01:23:06,023
 - Don't listen to him.

1412
01:23:08,418 --> 01:23:09,985
 - But he wasn't lying, was he?

1413
01:23:10,028 --> 01:23:11,769
 [Cal sighs]

1414
01:23:11,812 --> 01:23:12,987
 You knew them.

1415
01:23:14,946 --> 01:23:16,469
 And I killed them.

1416
01:23:16,513 --> 01:23:20,473
 - You didn't know what
 was really going on.

1417
01:23:20,517 --> 01:23:23,085
 [somber music]

1418
01:23:24,608 --> 01:23:28,264
 - [cries] I'm sorry.

1419
01:23:28,307 --> 01:23:30,570
 - Hey, it's not your fault.

1420
01:23:30,614 --> 01:23:32,616
- Who were they?
- Don't.

1421
01:23:33,617 --> 01:23:35,575
I'm the one
responsible here, okay?

1422
01:23:35,619 --> 01:23:37,055
 - Stop trying to
 make me feel better.

1423
01:23:37,099 --> 01:23:38,448
- Look, I'm not.

1424
01:23:40,798 --> 01:23:44,715
 Look, this job, it screwed
 up your life enough as it is.

1425
01:23:44,758 --> 01:23:46,456
 - I never should've said that.

1426
01:23:46,499 --> 01:23:48,240
 - Why not? It's true.

1427
01:23:51,635 --> 01:23:55,291
 I used to think I
 protected us enough and...

1428
01:23:57,902 --> 01:23:59,860
 I should've never
 put you at risk.

[phone beeping]

1437
01:25:03,010 --> 01:25:05,056
 I need an extract.

1438
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:06,057
 No, not me.

1439
01:25:07,058 --> 01:25:08,146
 My daughter.

1443
01:25:17,721 --> 01:25:20,202
 - It's not biological.

1444
01:25:20,245 --> 01:25:21,420
- What?

1445
01:25:21,464 --> 01:25:22,465
 - I think...

1446
01:25:24,206 --> 01:25:26,817
 I think I'm looking
 at sugar water.

1447
01:25:26,860 --> 01:25:28,514

1459
01:26:04,028 --> 01:26:05,508
 I said let him go.

1463
01:26:20,958 --> 01:26:22,960
Move it, get over there.

1464
01:26:29,445 --> 01:26:30,620
 - No, no!

1465
01:26:30,663 --> 01:26:31,751
 - The real vial
 is here somewhere.

1466
01:26:31,795 --> 01:26:32,752
 Where is it?

1467
01:26:32,796 --> 01:26:33,927
 - You have it.

1468
01:26:33,971 --> 01:26:37,366
 You have it, just
 let me and my dad go.

1469
01:26:37,409 --> 01:26:38,889
- You know, it's funny.

1470
01:26:38,932 --> 01:26:41,370
You keep bargaining for
him and two days ago

1471
01:26:41,413 --> 01:26:42,675
 you would have me
 pull the trigger

1472
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:44,547
 to get him out of your
 life once and for all.

1473
01:26:44,590 --> 01:26:45,591
 - That's not true.

1474
01:26:45,635 --> 01:26:46,809
 - Oh, that's cute.

1475
01:26:46,853 --> 01:26:48,681

 him then? Good!

 Stop playing games!

1479
01:26:55,688 --> 01:26:57,255
 There's no safe
 place to stash it,

1480
01:26:57,299 --> 01:27:00,954
 so you woulda kept it
 close just in case.

You have five seconds
to tell me where it is,

1484
01:27:06,699 --> 01:27:08,135
Red, or he dies.

1485
01:27:08,179 --> 01:27:09,180
- Don't.

1486
01:27:09,224 --> 01:27:10,094
 - One.

1487
01:27:10,137 --> 01:27:11,356

1488
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:12,835
 - Two.

1489
01:27:12,879 --> 01:27:14,272
 - The moment you tell
 him we're both dead.

1490
01:27:14,316 --> 01:27:16,448
- Three.
- Sean, please.

1491

1492
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:19,277
 It's outside.

1493

In the car, I...

1494
01:27:22,106 --> 01:27:24,108
I hid it inside the car.

1495
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:28,068
 - Show me.

1496
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:30,288
 Watch him.

1497
01:27:30,332 --> 01:27:34,727
 Let's go.

01:27:34,771 --> 01:27:36,294
 Where? Where?

1499
01:27:36,338 --> 01:27:37,513
 - In the back.

1500
01:27:38,514 --> 01:27:39,645
 In the trunk.

 [light dramatic music]

1502
01:27:48,306 --> 01:27:49,133

 Sit.

1504
01:27:59,491 --> 01:28:01,754
 - Come on, show me. Show me!

1505
01:28:02,929 --> 01:28:04,366
 Do you want me to
 bring Cal down here

1506
01:28:04,409 --> 01:28:06,977
 and kill him slowly
 in front of you?

1507
01:28:07,020 --> 01:28:08,326
 Where is it?

1508
01:28:08,370 --> 01:28:12,896
 - It's with the spare tire.
 [suspenseful music]

 get out of the way.

 Get it now!

 out if they arrest you, too.

1623
01:37:44,467 --> 01:37:47,513
 - Excuse me, we'll
 take it from here.

1624
01:37:50,125 --> 01:37:50,952
 - You.

1625
01:37:51,822 --> 01:37:52,648
 Alive.

1626
01:37:54,433 --> 01:37:55,260
- Good to see you again.

1627
01:37:55,304 --> 01:37:56,914
 - [Man] You as well.

1628
01:37:56,958 --> 01:37:58,481
 - You're...

1629
01:37:58,523 --> 01:38:02,659
- And next time, careful
what you shoot at.

1630
01:38:02,702 --> 01:38:03,529
- Sorry.

1631
01:38:05,009 --> 01:38:06,445
- Let's get you outta here, sir.

1632
01:38:06,489 --> 01:38:09,100
 - [Cal] All right, thanks.

1633
01:38:09,144 --> 01:38:11,407
 [light dramatic music]
 [sirens wailing]

1634
01:38:11,450 --> 01:38:12,277
 - You got hit.

1635
01:38:12,321 --> 01:38:13,583
- Yeah, it's...

1636
01:38:14,844 --> 01:38:17,326
 [light music]

1637
01:38:23,680 --> 01:38:26,509
 [muffled talking]

1638
01:38:31,514 --> 01:38:32,994
 Hey.

1639
01:38:33,037 --> 01:38:33,995
 - Hi.

1640
01:38:34,038 --> 01:38:36,475
- Thanks for meeting me.
- Yeah.

1641
01:38:36,519 --> 01:38:38,041
 - This looks good.

1642
01:38:38,085 --> 01:38:39,782
 - Yeah, it kinda does.

1643
01:38:39,826 --> 01:38:41,306
How's your leg?

1644
01:38:41,350 --> 01:38:42,351
 - It's fine.

1645
01:38:43,482 --> 01:38:44,831
 Stitches itch.

1646
01:38:44,875 --> 01:38:46,094
 - Don't scratch it, okay?

1647
01:38:46,137 --> 01:38:47,225
 It's gonna make it worse.

1648
01:38:47,269 --> 01:38:49,401
 Just keep it covered.

1649
01:38:49,445 --> 01:38:51,273
 - Yes, Nurse Scarlett.

1650
01:38:55,059 --> 01:38:56,843
 Well, the realtor called.

1651
01:38:56,887 --> 01:38:59,759
 She's got some decent
 options this time.

1652
01:38:59,803 --> 01:39:02,066
 - Remote enough for
 Grandma's new house?

1653
01:39:02,110 --> 01:39:05,635
 - Off the beaten path, yet
 close enough to the city.

1654
01:39:05,678 --> 01:39:08,681
 - You know, we could
 keep the old one.

1655
01:39:08,725 --> 01:39:09,726
 - Too risky.

1656
01:39:13,034 --> 01:39:16,820
 Maybe you wanna come take a
 look at some of the new ones?

1657
01:39:16,862 --> 01:39:18,603
 - I have an exam.

1658
01:39:18,648 --> 01:39:20,128
 - Yeah, of course.

1659
01:39:21,825 --> 01:39:24,741
 - Could we go this
 weekend instead?

1660
01:39:27,570 --> 01:39:29,485
- Yeah, I'll set it up.

1661
01:39:34,228 --> 01:39:37,884
Maybe you wanna hit the
shooting range, too?

1662
01:39:37,928 --> 01:39:39,234
- Don't push it.

1663
01:39:40,670 --> 01:39:45,544
 [Cal chuckles]
 [light dramatic music]

1664
01:39:45,588 --> 01:39:48,939
[dramatic upbeat music]
