1
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,500
Forty-year-old Gyrese,
you are not the father.

2
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,900
This nigger from New York
from the olden days...

3
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,580
bumpy son, bumpy.

4
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,620
Pose some secrets that are feeding
Shannon's crystal meth addiction.

5
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,920
- Now wait a minute, Kim.
- Get the [beep] out of my face!

6
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,027
What's wrong with you?
What the [beep] is your...

7
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,420
We already know what it is.
It's freestyle Friday.

8
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,980
A race war has erupted...

9
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,220
at one of the nation's oldest
and most prestigious institutions.

10
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,380
Outrage over an African-American
themed party...

11
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,860
organized by predominantly white
students of Winchester University...

12
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,100
...has resulted in rioting
and property damages.

13
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,340
Police were called to disrupt
a massive fight that broke out...

14
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,740
...between African-American
students and partygoers...

15
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,900
just after midnight.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,700
To address diversity issues,
the school have recently...

17
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,740
...appointed African-American
scholar Dr. Walter Fairbanks...

18
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,300
as dean of students.

19
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,540
Last year the Dean's office
celebrated slight...

20
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,140
...gains in diverse applicants...

21
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,260
but with many now calling
for Fairbanks' resignation...

22
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,300
that may have been premature.

23
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,940
School officials released a statement
claiming that an investigation...

24
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,620
into those responsible for the party...

25
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,020
and subsequent riot is underway.

26
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,300
An invite to the Halloween party,
sent via social media...

27
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,780
asked guests to liberate
their inner Negro...

28
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,740
fry up chicken...

29
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,889
enjoy a cough syrup based concoction
known as purple drank...

30
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,900
Dear white people.

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,300
The minimum requirement
of black friends...

32
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,060
needed to not seem racist
has just been raised to two.

33
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,041
Sorry, but your weed man
Tyrone does not count.

34
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,649
Hey, Kurt, you home?

35
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,900
Hey, you've reached Garmin House,
home of Lionel Higgins...

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,420
the only bitch on campus
who will give you a dickscount.

37
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,540
That's right, hunty,
the bigger the dick...

38
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,961
the less you have to pay me to suck it.

39
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,044
Kurt, it's Lionel.
I'm locked out.

40
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,051
You know my parents call this line.

41
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,140
All right. Bye.

42
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,900
Dear white people...

43
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,580
apparently Morgan Freeman wasn't enough.

44
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,980
Obama could cure cancer...

45
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,620
and somewhere white folks
will be embroiled in protest.

46
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,768
And he's only half black.

47
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,140
- Talk to me.
- Hello there.

48
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,860
First time caller, long time listener.

49
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,460
So Sam, how would you feel...

50
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,140
if someone started a Dear Black People?

51
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,100
No need.

52
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,980
Mass media from Fox News
to reality TV on VH1...

53
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,980
makes it clear
what white people think of us.

54
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,491
Thanks for calling.

55
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,380
I'm pissed.

56
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,180
The whole point of randomized housing...

57
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,980
is to mix shit up.

58
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,820
I'm out here trying
to find the Olivier...

59
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,060
to my Halle Berry...

60
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,260
and they got me out here...

61
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,060
looking like an extra
on A Different World.

62
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,900
That's not okay. At all.

63
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,780
So your YouTube show, it's called...

64
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,420
"Doing Time at an Ivy League?"

65
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,660
In my second year
of a four year sentence.

66
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,780
Armstrong-Parker,
that's your housing assignment?

67
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,340
Traditionally it's where
the hopelessly Afrocentric gather...

68
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,580
to process their guilt
over not going to an HBCU.

69
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,569
Where the negros be at.

70
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,569
That's not where
you wanted to be, right?

71
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,123
Bechet House is more my style.

72
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,686
The rich white kids.

73
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,620
Excuse me?

74
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,220
- What part of Chicago are you from?
- Hyde Park.

75
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,420
What street?

76
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,205
- Seventy-eighth and...
- Seventy-eighth!

77
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,620
That's Southside, sweetheart.

78
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,660
You know what they say.

79
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,900
You can take the girl out the hood,
but you cannot take the hood...

80
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,446
There is nothing hood about me.

81
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,761
Thank you for your time.

82
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,140
So, how long will you
be on campus for casting?

83
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,860
Let me explain to you
the way reality TV works.

84
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,645
I'm the producer.
I ask the questions.

85
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,205
We'll be in touch.

86
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,420
Your hair is so cute B.T. Dubs.

87
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,887
- Well, you're so cute.
- Is it weaved?

88
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,764
I saw "Good Hair" in Afro Studies.

89
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,940
So, what house did you get?

90
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,931
- Oh, Bechet, bitch.
- Of course.

91
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,884
The mere thought of a Fletcher
anywhere else...

92
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,780
Oh, easy.

93
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,020
It was the luck of the draw.

94
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,420
Daddy had nothing to do with it.

95
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,580
Besides, if I had to pick
anywhere to be...

96
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,980
it would be here.

97
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,940
Well, I'm down to switch.

98
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,180
You get your Denzel, I get my Gosling.

99
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,725
Oh, I gots mine.

100
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,409
Do you want to meet him?

101
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,220
Cute, for a black boy.

102
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,162
Hey, Boo!

103
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,620
I want you to meet my friend Coco.

104
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,051
She's new to the house.

105
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,660
Hi, I'm Troy.

106
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,460
Welcome to Armstrong-Parker...

107
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,780
home of the dopest dining hall
in all of Winchester.

108
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,820
Are we on duty?

109
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,500
Babe, Head of House is always on duty.

110
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,540
Well, I should get going.

111
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,500
Thanks, Sof.

112
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,568
- Bye.
- Bye.

113
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,460
So, babe, you think
I got time for a quick cut?

114
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,820
You just got it cut last week.

115
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,967
It's a black thing, babe.

116
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,340
Since when is OCD a black thang?

117
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,522
Babe, please don't say
"thang" like that.

118
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,700
Besides, you have a shift
over at the Politicos booth...

119
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,540
and then you have
a shift at Orientation...

120
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,860
and then your advisor is coming over.

121
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,088
Okay, you know what?
I'll just wear a hat.

122
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,689
And then a movie maybe?
Just us?

123
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,362
Election night.
Babe, come on.

124
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,380
All right.

125
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,244
Yo, Kurt!

126
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,207
- My man.
- All right!

127
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,405
Hey, sis.

128
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,540
Is she kidding with this?

129
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,900
You don't have to run again.

130
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,100
Just because it's her doesn't mean...

131
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,340
Babe, I can't let Sam and her
wannabe Black Panthers take the house.

132
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,980
The house needs me, who I am.

133
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,260
It's who he wants you to be.

134
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,900
So you take a couple
of psych classes and now...

135
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,620
all of a sudden,
you think you're Freud?

136
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,100
Oh, a Freud reference?
Sophisticated.

137
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:34,240
Okay. Beck, Jung, Maslow.

138
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,420
Dear white people, this just in.

139
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,921
Dating a black person
to piss off your parents...

140
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,620
is a form of racism.

141
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,820
Yo, Troy, I forget.

142
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,810
Is your major in shucking
or was it jiving?

143
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,980
Well, my major's in Shuck.
I'm minoring in Jiving...

144
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,129
Wow, you're still majoring
in trying to fuck my leftovers, right?

145
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,120
You need a shower.

146
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,180
You're like Artie.

147
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,980
Dawg, your success ratio
with the ladies went up like 30%...

148
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,340
after I started edging you up, dawg.

149
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,460
Like, come on! You know?

150
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,927
You went from ODB to Trey Songz!

151
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,740
That's his platform? Haircuts?

152
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,410
Oofta is as oofta does.

153
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,841
Yes? Someone else is running?

154
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,780
Just because we're colored...

155
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,340
don't mean we run
on colored people time.

156
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,980
Boycotting hot combs don't make you
an expert on colored people, Boo.

157
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,890
I care about each
and every single one of you.

158
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,284
I care about this house.

159
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,369
So if it ain't broke...

160
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,780
All right, thank you, Troy Fairbanks.

161
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,565
Is this because of us?

162
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,940
Because we broke up over a year ago.

163
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,100
You seriously think you can win?

164
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,020
Troy, we live in a world where
there's a Big Mama's House 3.

165
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,205
I don't think I have
a chance in hell. Thank God.

166
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,727
Troy, my brother, it's broke.

167
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,100
Mm-hm.

168
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,680
Troy is a legacy kid...

169
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,220
and yet it's under his watch...

170
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,340
that Armstrong-Parker...

171
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,820
the bastion of black culture here...

172
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,780
was gutted...

173
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,860
by the Randomization of Housing Act.

174
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,260
Now, second years of color...

175
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,460
no longer have a say in where they go.

176
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,180
The culture that's been fostered...

177
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,900
in this house for two decades...

178
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,060
will be wiped out in two years.

179
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,220
This wasn't motivated
by a desire to mix things up...

180
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,700
bring about racial
and socioeconomic harmony, no.

181
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,660
The black kids are sitting together...

182
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,420
in the proverbial cafeteria...

183
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,780
so they must be up to no good.

184
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,820
Yeah! Mm-hm.

185
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,811
Over a century of houses
grouped by sports affiliations...

186
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,460
political leanings, majors, you name it.

187
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,564
Black kids get their own house
and suddenly we got a problem?

188
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,940
This doesn't affect the other houses
like it does ours.

189
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,740
There are plenty of trustees,
former coaches...

190
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,490
presidents watching out
for the others...

191
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,260
but all we have is a dean
who would rather please his massa...

192
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,940
- Yo, that's enough of that, Sam!
- Then stand up for his own!

193
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,100
Yes! Tell him! Yes!

194
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,940
I know y'all ain't gonna vote for me.

195
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,565
Y'all ain't ready.

196
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:03,087
The Black Student Union and I
have brought a petition...

197
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,420
to repeal
the Randomization of Housing Act.

198
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,660
I plan on bringing it
to the President and together...

199
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,940
we can bring black back to Winchester.

200
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,087
Yes!

201
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,930
It'll be by the door.

202
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,660
Quiet!

203
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,524
All right.

204
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,860
I assume everyone has
the app I created by now?

205
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,220
It's a child's app.

206
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,449
Good.
Voting may commence.

207
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,260
Okay.

208
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,805
Looks like we've got a winner.

209
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,380
Sam White?

210
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,860
Oh, shit.

211
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,166
Congratulations.

212
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,980
So that's what you're looking for?

213
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,082
I just want to make
good TV, sweetheart.

214
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,124
Well, I think I'd be good TV.

215
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,260
You're getting a great education
at a great school.

216
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,700
Why don't you just be good at that.

217
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,260
I am.

218
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,700
And when I graduate early with an
economics degree from Winchester...

219
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,260
it'll be the crowning achievement...

220
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,660
of my black middle class
parents' ambitions.

221
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,100
Yeah, well, conflict
is a commodity in my industry.

222
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,420
Sam has that. Do you?

223
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,900
So, what?
You want me to start a fight?

224
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,209
I don't want you to do anything
you wouldn't otherwise do.

225
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,282
Hey, you reached Garmin House...

226
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,580
home of Lionel Higgins...

227
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,260
the only bitch on campus
who will give you a dickscount.

228
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,020
That's right, hunty,
the bigger the dick...

229
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,930
the less you have to pay me to suck it.

230
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,420
Everything's pretty locked up...

231
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,540
but we will find a residence
to move you into.

232
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,020
Third time's a charm, right?

233
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,900
What about Armstrong-Parker?

234
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,126
I don't know if that's...

235
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,620
I might have an opening.

236
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,900
That might be good
for you to be around...

237
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,780
Dean, the worst thing
about high school...

238
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,441
and believe me, it's a long list,
were the black kids.

239
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,300
Maybe it's in your head, son.

240
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,900
Sure, folks can be intolerant
around people like you.

241
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,980
And homosexuals just...

242
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,686
I... I don't believe in labels.

243
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,526
You like jazz, Lionel?

244
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,767
Winchester is like jazz.

245
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,340
- It's a research school.
- Andjazz is tension.

246
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:07,500
The interplay of improvised solos...

247
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,220
all creating one song.

248
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,740
Your problem is
you've got no instrument.

249
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,940
No major,
no affiliations, no solo, son.

250
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,780
I submit articles
to the independent Observer.

251
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,820
No one reads the independent Observer.

252
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,660
My point is are you playing
swing or bebop?

253
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,020
You're mixing your metaphors.

254
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,980
Are you a sax or are you a trumpet?

255
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,491
I don't like jazz.

256
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,820
Look, I'll do what I can.

257
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,380
But not a word of this
in the Observer, okay?

258
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,811
No one reads it, right?

259
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,060
Lionel, right?

260
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,500
George. We had Civ last semester.
How's it going?

261
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,060
Oh, yeah. Great,
I mean, good, yeah.

262
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,740
Fan of your stuff in the Observer.

263
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,060
No one reads the Observer.

264
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,100
Have you seen this?

265
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,100
The residents of Armstrong-Parker
just made her head of house.

266
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,646
Am I crazy or is there a there there?

267
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,020
What made you come over here? I mean...

268
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,122
It's not like I didn't...
I'm glad you came, I just...

269
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,300
My staff.
God bless them.

270
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,700
They are whiter
than Michael Jackson's kids.

271
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,140
I mean, we're fucked
if any one of them...

272
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,140
tries to write this story
and I won't let the transfers...

273
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,140
at the Gazette do it first.

274
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,446
Well, this one has his face.

275
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,260
You're in the Black Student Union.
You probably know Sam.

276
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,780
You come up with a good angle...
I want it in the Bugle.

277
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,980
- Trumpet.
- Bugle. Focus.

278
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,340
The only paper on campus...

279
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,420
with an advisor
with The New York Times.

280
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,380
Only so many ways a person
can distinguish themselves...

281
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,845
at a place like this, Lionel.

282
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,643
You're good.
You belong with us.

283
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,960
Did you get it?

284
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,460
Good.

285
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,767
You've now got the shared calendar...

286
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,008
contacts, and official email.

287
00:17:54,560 --> 00:18:01,860
And before I forget.

288
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,580
- Event requests for the year?
- Just this month.

289
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,740
They all need your approval.

290
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,900
And don't forget
to pick your office hours.

291
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,660
You need at least 20 per week.

292
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,683
That's absurd.

293
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,500
Well, you're now head
of a hundred residents.

294
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,500
And they all need time
to complain to your face about...

295
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,860
noise, leaky pipes...

296
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,020
gluten-free option
in the cafeteria, etc.

297
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,886
Troy, I didn't think I was gonna win.

298
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,260
Look, I'm late for lunch.

299
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,647
By the way,
petitioning the President...

300
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,500
on the Randomization of Housing Act...

301
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,460
ain't gonna do shit.

302
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,580
None of the other houses are concerned.

303
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,060
Because they all have a legacy
of rich and powerful allies...

304
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,700
who will make sure that "random"
works to their advantage.

305
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,849
And you really think a petition
is going to change that?

306
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,481
Hello?

307
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,420
Yeah.

308
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,727
Okay, well, just call me
the minute there's an update.

309
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,140
The Armstrong-Parker dining hall...

310
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,940
is the epicenter of black culture...

311
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,780
as it stands at Winchester.

312
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,980
Only here can you
commiserate, celebrate...

313
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,300
and discuss everything
from Kanye West lyrics...

314
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,260
to theoretical relativism
all in a sitting...

315
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,126
not to mention find someone
who can actually do your hair.

316
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,340
You still using your ID?

317
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,180
I always forget passwords.

318
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,580
You are begging to get hacked.

319
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,580
Good thing the one evil techno-genius...

320
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,300
thinking like that is on my side.

321
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,940
We was robbed.

322
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,610
That election was suspect, man.

323
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,140
There is this one other sister
in my Relativity class...

324
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,940
and I'll be damned if our professor...

325
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,180
doesn't call me Loretta
every goddamn time.

326
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,980
We all look the same.

327
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,780
Programming professor gets me
and Martin here mixed up constantly.

328
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,980
You should be so lucky.

329
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,660
Cute. You get that at Toys "R" Us?

330
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,100
The talented tenth always...

331
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,980
has to bust its ass
a little bit harder...

332
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,580
but I don't see what the point is...

333
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,460
in blaming white folks for everything.

334
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,980
Who's blaming, Blue Eyes?

335
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,260
I really don't see the issue.

336
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,420
Never had one.
Never ran into any lynch mobs.

337
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,820
Lynch mob's still here.
Just re-branded itself.

338
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,740
- As what, pray tell?
- The Republican Party.

339
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,500
You want to know
how the world sees you?

340
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,620
You go to a Young
Republican's meeting...

341
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,100
and bring up welfare.

342
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,646
- Or immigration.
- Or gay rights.

343
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,407
Bullshit.

344
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,460
You have something to add?

345
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,483
Me? Yeah, I do.

346
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,180
Look, your biggest athletes, right?

347
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,540
Movies stars...

348
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,860
Hell, guys, my president is black.

349
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,940
Okay, sometimes I think
the hardest thing to be...

350
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,340
in the American work force right now...

351
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,727
is an educated white guy.

352
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,220
You're not serious?

353
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,580
Hey look, you guys
still got affirmative action...

354
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,620
that's all I'm saying.

355
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,500
I'm sorry,
what exactly are you doing here?

356
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,620
All right, check this out.
You ready? Obama, right?

357
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,940
Leader of the free world.

358
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,260
He gets into Harvard based on... You!

359
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,820
Too late.
Affirmative action.

360
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,020
You know who's not president
right now? No?

361
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,980
The guy who didn't get in.

362
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,580
Well, on behalf
of all the colored folks in the room...

363
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,900
let me apologize to all
the better qualified white students...

364
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,300
whose place we're taking up.

365
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,100
No, it's fine.
We're okay.

366
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,380
I'm sorry, did you get lost?

367
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,660
Bechet is that way.

368
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,420
Oh, I know where it is.
I'm actually supposed to eat there.

369
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,460
Yeah, it's just there's... this is the
only dining hall that you can actually...

370
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,881
get yourself some chicken and waffles.

371
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,404
Look, you're Dear White People, right?

372
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,700
It's funny.

373
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,140
It's funny stuff, it really is.

374
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,100
How have we not staffed you yet?

375
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,020
Oh, me? Oh what?

376
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,780
On Pastiche,
your uninspired humor magazine?

377
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,340
It's actually much more
than just a magazine, sweetheart.

378
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,780
SNL staff is basically
half Lampoon, half Pastiche.

379
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,620
Same goes for the network comedies.

380
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,580
And what gives you clubhouse kids...

381
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,260
the right to come to our dining hall?

382
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,361
You don't live here.

383
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,940
- Sam, what are you doing?
- So you can't eat here.

384
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,780
Chill, Sam. Damn, all right?
Let the man...

385
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,245
- Got this.
- Got this.

386
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,740
Look, who are you to throw me out?

387
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:29,050
Oh! Well, I think
I'm head of this house.

388
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,685
And I'm doing things my way.

389
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,766
Your way.

390
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,605
Excuse me.

391
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,420
Serious question.
Do you know who I am?

392
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,220
Yeah, I know your dad is the president.

393
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:51,860
Good.

394
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,620
He's the same one
that has been pushing...

395
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,100
to break up this house for a decade.

396
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,940
What's wrong? Is he afraid that letting
the negros gather in groups...

397
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,780
might start a little rebellion
on his plantation?

398
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,329
Oh, well, then you tell him
from me, that he should be.

399
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,570
Yeah. Bad move.

400
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,770
Let's go.

401
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,249
Excuse me. Sorry.

402
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,248
Excuse us.

403
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,884
You, too.

404
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,780
Me?

405
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,281
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Do you live here?

406
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,369
She the man.
She the man.

407
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,287
Dear white people, stop dancing.

408
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,286
The fuck?

409
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,940
Yeah, well, conflict
is a commodity in my industry.

410
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,088
Sam has that. Do you?

411
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,340
Welcome, muffins.

412
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,100
So, I hate to do it to you...

413
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,020
but I'm gonna have to get
real black with you for a second.

414
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,660
So the other day, a girl
had the nerve to fix her mouth...

415
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,460
and ask me if my hair was weaved.

416
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,060
Weaved?
Really, bitch?

417
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,900
First of all, if you're
going to fix your mouth...

418
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,580
to ask me something like that...

419
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,420
say it right, please.
It's weave.

420
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,220
Noun. Present tense.

421
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,004
Second of all, don't assume...

422
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,963
just because you see
a sister with some hair...

423
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,340
that it's a weave. Is it?

424
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,140
If a bitch could grow straight Indian hair
directly out of her own head...

425
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,660
she wouldn't have just overdrafted
her account paying for this shit...

426
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,380
but that ain't your business, Boo-Boo.

427
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,220
Are those your lips, sweetie?

428
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,180
Is that really your skin?

429
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,740
These white girls and their tans...

430
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,740
they're starting
to get darker than me...

431
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,207
which isn't that dark.

432
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,402
Dear white people,
what do I think about it?

433
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,700
Okay. Anyone have any comments...

434
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,644
for Sam's Rebirth of a Nation?

435
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,020
- Could I?
- Gabe, go ahead.

436
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,580
I dig the silent movie thing,
but it's a little self-congratulatory.

437
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,020
Light on story...

438
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,500
and frankly thematically dubious.

439
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,965
Anyone else?

440
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,980
Sam?

441
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,380
Before you say anything...

442
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,260
might I remind you
that I sat through...

443
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,964
A Birth of a Nation,
Gone with the Wind...

444
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,140
and Tarantino week without protest.

445
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,140
Yeah, and might I also
remind you that I read...

446
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,260
your entire 15 page,
unsolicited treatise...

447
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,940
on why the Gremlins
is actually about...

448
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,820
suburban white fear of black culture.

449
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,980
The gremlins are loud, talk in slang,
are addicted to fried chicken...

450
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,660
and freak out
when you get their hair wet.

451
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,525
The only problem that I have
with your film is that it was late.

452
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,449
The silent projects were last semester.

453
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,100
You were supposed to e-mail me
your sound treatment over the summer.

454
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,420
I have radio, BSU...

455
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,740
now this Head of House thing.

456
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,020
Okay, do you want this?

457
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,100
Look, this thing
might as well be my right hand.

458
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,220
I was busy this summer.

459
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,300
Your peers are out getting internships,
making short films.

460
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,300
My dad was sick.

461
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,620
I had to go home.

462
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,140
If you need time, take it.

463
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,740
But if you want
to be here next semester...

464
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,060
- I do.
- Pull it together!

465
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,525
This is Winchester.

466
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,443
Thematically dubious.

467
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,260
Well, what was that supposed
to be about exactly?

468
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,408
You're thematically dubious!

469
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,420
Since when do TA's give critiques?

470
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,780
You invoke minstrelsy
for shock value, to what end?

471
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,060
To invoke the same feeling
I get when I turn on the TV...

472
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,180
and see some so-called reality star
shuck and jive for ratings...

473
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,500
egged on by no doubt white producers.

474
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,900
Or the sassy black secretary...

475
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,180
who has no backstory
or character development...

476
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,340
aside from her skin color.

477
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,460
So it's a tit for tat?

478
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,847
Are you honestly saying
that art can't be reactionary?

479
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,980
You're reacting to something
that's 100 years old.

480
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,380
Because fear of black men
involved in U.S. government...

481
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,220
is a completely antiquated concept.

482
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,900
No social relevance today.

483
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,660
I think that sometimes
you should hold...

484
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,980
a mirror up to your audience...

485
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,340
rather than dropping
an ideological piano on their head.

486
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,020
I just think that works
that deal with the African Diaspora...

487
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,140
through a post-modern lens
are outright rejected...

488
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,700
unless handled by a white artist.

489
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,500
- African Diaspora?
- Yeah, I said it.

490
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,500
I'm sorry, but blackface
is alive and well in our culture.

491
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,220
Who primarily buys hip hop...

492
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,129
watches Housewives of Atlanta?

493
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:29,100
The same homogenized images
of black people over and over again?

494
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,340
White people, Gabe.

495
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,100
Who goes to see Tyler Perry movies?

496
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,420
We're an underfed community.

497
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,460
None of this changes
the fact that the vibrancy...

498
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,140
the complexity
of black culture has been distilled...

499
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,140
into commodities and marketing schemes
to be bought and sold.

500
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,180
To the detriment
of the so called "real thing." Got it.

501
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,820
It means that I am indistinguishable
from the so called "urban" images...

502
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,620
of black folks used to amuse
and market to white America.

503
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,100
And the commodification of culture
is uniquely oppressive to black people?

504
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,100
So when Kanye raps about Louis V...

505
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,820
and Rolexes and Classical art...

506
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,900
exactly what exploited pockets
of Black America...

507
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,447
- are those references being mined from?
- From...

508
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,811
On your knees.

509
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:36,060
What?

510
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,540
You dream in "Cosby" again?

511
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:45,380
My hair was so straight.
My sweater so big.

512
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,891
I told you about that?

513
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:31,380
Hey so, this whole
Head of House thing. Congrats?

514
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:36,860
Yeah, it's, it's...

515
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,660
Weird, right?

516
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,569
I never took you
as a student politician.

517
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,321
Yeah, well...

518
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,285
Sam?

519
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,729
What are we doing?

520
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,529
Fucking.

521
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,580
Dear white people...

522
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,700
please stop touching my hair.

523
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,940
Does this look like a
petting zoo to you?

524
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,860
Kurt, it's 3:00.

525
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,008
I know it's already 3:00.

526
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,925
Yo, can I hit that bottle?

527
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,404
Look, we're doing
staff picks at game night.

528
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,700
We don't even have a staff yet.

529
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,131
I don't understand...

530
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,820
- Why are we even planning this?
- Everybody wants to be on our staff.

531
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,921
That's the easy part.

532
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,540
Look, we're doing
staff picks at game night.

533
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,620
RSVPs are already
through the roof on that anyway.

534
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,660
Halloween is our premiere party.

535
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,366
The waitlist is already 100 deep.

536
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,460
Guys, we gotta do something huge...

537
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,380
to outdo this summer.

538
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,180
We can always do
East-West hip hop party.

539
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,700
Get the honeys up on this piece.

540
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,260
"Honeys." You're from Vermont.

541
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,780
Guys, what's the Pastiche motto?

542
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,140
"Sharpen thy sword."

543
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,900
You mean to tell me...

544
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,128
our motto is a euphemism
for jerking off?

545
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,660
No. It's a reminder
that satire is the weapon of reason.

546
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:40,500
So who on campus
is being most unreasonable?

547
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,380
You know what it's a reminder to me of?

548
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,300
How gay Gordon is.

549
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,180
- Was that a reasonable attempt...
- What do you want?

550
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,580
- At a quip, Mitch?
- Could you say reasonable one more time?

551
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,940
- It makes you sound good.
- Guys, shut up.

552
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,380
Knowing Lil' Wayne lyrics...

553
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,860
no longer earns you
an honorary black card.

554
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,566
It just reminds me of how often
you say the word "nigga"...

555
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,460
when no one black is around...

556
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,100
as is required in reciting said lyrics.

557
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,690
Look at that.

558
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,820
God, who does Sam think she is?

559
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,780
Seriously, dude, it's like...

560
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,850
Spike Lee and Oprah had
some sort of pissed off baby.

561
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,780
Hey.

562
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,580
- Uh-huh.
- Can we? Could we?

563
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,140
How?

564
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,526
Easy.

565
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,940
Hi, Lionel.
What do you want?

566
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:32,060
Lionel, I spoke with the dean today.

567
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,100
We had a very
enlightening conversation.

568
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,180
And I just wanted to let you know...

569
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,964
I'm sorry about the voice message.

570
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,340
Do you accept?
Do you?

571
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,300
Please put that away.

572
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,404
Sometimes you just got to talk
to these people in a language...

573
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,460
that they're going to understand.

574
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,086
- Pathetic.
- What was that?

575
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,700
All right.

576
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,420
Wherever they ship you off to...

577
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,808
be sure to pack
a sense of humor, all right?

578
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,167
The Tip Test.

579
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,300
You hit up Jelly's for a snack.

580
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,860
Your waitress mistakes you
for someone who looks like you, black...

581
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:35,060
who once ran up a $30 bill
and left a dollar tip.

582
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,050
You watch all the other
customers order before you do...

583
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,820
Pastrami sandwich on rye.

584
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:45,005
And then proceed to wait no less
than 40 minutes for your food.

585
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,940
How do you tip?

586
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:51,848
A.

587
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,340
40 minutes?
She's lucky if she gets 40 cents.

588
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,060
Okay, you do a good job,
maybe see a tip.

589
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,002
B.

590
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,460
She was tripping, but...

591
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,260
15% is the least I can do.

592
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,780
Or C.

593
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,486
I reject the stereotype
that African-Americans do not tip.

594
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:11,082
I will leave 20... no, 25,
just to prove that I can.

595
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,767
One hundred. Oofta. Nose job.

596
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,051
Dear white people...

597
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,740
In a shocking reversal...

598
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,889
using the term "African-American"
is borderline racist now.

599
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,580
It turns out if you're too worried
about political correctness...

600
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,380
to say "black", odds are...

601
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,380
you secretly just want
to call us niggers anyway...

602
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,300
and truth be told, I'd rather
you just be honest about it.

603
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,940
Free speech, my ass.

604
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,380
Oh, Stalin quotes for 200, please?

605
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,860
Oh, you're joking about this?

606
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,220
Oh, I'm sorry.

607
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,260
Was I supposed to take
"Free speech, my ass"...

608
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,020
as a legitimate suggestion?

609
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,980
This is your office's issue, Walter.

610
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,780
Especially after that episode
with Kurt in the dining hall.

611
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,500
Oh, all race issues are my issues.

612
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,660
This is a student issue...

613
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,900
and you are the Dean of Students,
aren't you?

614
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,700
The last thing we need...

615
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,768
is race war in the papers
across this country.

616
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,660
How do you think the donor base
will feel about that?

617
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,060
The fundraiser is four weeks away.

618
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,811
How bad is this deficit of yours?

619
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,580
It's worse.

620
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,500
And I want to make
something really clear.

621
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,300
If this gets any bigger at all,
it's on you, Walter.

622
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,820
- Racism is over in America.
- What?

623
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,700
The only people
who are thinking about it are...

624
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,484
I don't know...
Mexicans, probably.

625
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,044
Come on in, son.
I was just leaving.

626
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,540
President Fletcher.

627
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,608
- You call me Herb, son.
- All right.

628
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:49,140
Fletcher tells me his son
got his ass handed to him.

629
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,162
About time.

630
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,965
No, Sam was out of line.

631
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,722
Kurt is all right.

632
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,247
Well, but you're supposed
to be better than all right.

633
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,940
Since when do we start
losing elections, Troy?

634
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,020
Well, Dad, the Housing Act
passing without a fight didn't help.

635
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,724
And what did I tell you about excuses?

636
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,980
Pops, my course load is full anyway.

637
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,740
I'm head of Econ. Board...

638
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,922
plus, I'm uh...

639
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,928
I'm thinking about joining Pastiche.

640
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,500
Pastiche.

641
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,250
Yeah, you know,
to help round out the rest.

642
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:26,020
On Kurt Fletcher's staff.

643
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,180
I'll be goddamned if after 20 years...

644
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,540
you're working for that dumbass's son.

645
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,740
Yes, sir.

646
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,241
Fletcher and I
graduated one year apart.

647
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,649
He barely made it through.

648
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,740
I graduated summa cum laude.

649
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,940
Now who is president and who is dean?

650
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,220
What's the difference?

651
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,380
Oh, a few hundred thousand dollars
a year, for starters.

652
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,164
Understand what I'm saying?

653
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,163
What happened between you and Sam
that she's coming after you now?

654
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,220
Sophia.

655
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,940
I mean, you do remember
Sophia, don't you...

656
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,740
daughter of the president,
Psych. Major...

657
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,940
"Has the whole world
ahead of her, Troy"?

658
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,884
- Watch your tone.
- Sorry, sir.

659
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,811
So you lost the house.

660
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,420
Onto the school presidency.

661
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,220
It would be good to show
that the campus...

662
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,847
is capable of electing
someone like you...

663
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,121
as school president.

664
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,140
Someone like me.

665
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,083
Someone like you.

666
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,648
Hey, Babe, hat or no hat?

667
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,205
Are you wearing that?

668
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,251
I don't have to be.

669
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,100
Hey, Boo.

670
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,540
How about we put...

671
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,060
some of your newfound
free time to good use, hm?

672
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,860
It's been a while since we...

673
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,860
What is with all this "Boo" stuff?

674
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,644
Since you fucked me
with your big, black cock.

675
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,620
It used to turn you on
when I talked like that.

676
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,580
Is it me?

677
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,444
Sweetheart, I love you.

678
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,140
- Is it Sam?
- Can we please just get ready?

679
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,780
Why? I hate my brother's friends.

680
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,740
So you're not going with me.

681
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,980
You'd go without me?

682
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,460
But... you're my guest.

683
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,180
I mean, you could
just hang out here and I'll...

684
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,220
What is it with you and my brother?

685
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,580
Are you in love with him?

686
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,020
Is this some, like, DL shit?

687
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,326
DL shit?

688
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,729
Wait, Sophia, hold on. Just stay.

689
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,140
- No, I'm not going.
- All right, I'll go with you.

690
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,500
- No.
- I'll-I'll go with you.

691
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,090
Sophia?

692
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,780
Oh, my God.
He did not.

693
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,380
- Oh, he did.
- You are so crazy.

694
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,367
Oh, yeah.

695
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,900
I could do better.

696
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,580
Shh, wait, wait. Quiet. Wait, wait.
I want to watch this.

697
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,580
If a bitch could grow straight Indian
hair directly out of her own head...

698
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,860
she wouldn't have just overdrafted
her account paying for this shit...

699
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,420
but that ain't your business, Boo-Boo.

700
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:19,180
Oh, my God.
I am so sharing this.

701
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,700
Send me the link.

702
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,881
I totally will.

703
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:28,768
Who was that?

704
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,360
New staffer, maybe.

705
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:35,961
Don't worry. The negro at the door
is not here to rape you.

706
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,220
So this is what editors do?

707
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,620
We're taking a break.

708
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,404
What are you doing here?

709
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,980
You said you want me to drop in
and tell you how the story was going.

710
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,660
Like next week.

711
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,500
It's Saturday night.
You don't have anywhere else to be?

712
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,860
Well, it was either this
or the new Madea movie.

713
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,620
Oh, dear God.
Where does she go this time?

714
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,607
Dialysis?

715
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,969
Man, fuck Tyler Perry.

716
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,500
Yes, can we have a movie
with, you know, characters in them...

717
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,060
instead of stereotypes
wrapped in Christian dogma?

718
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,420
Why is every educated person
inherently evil?

719
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,580
Why is this nigga in a motherfucking dress
all the motherfucking time?

720
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,900
How come the only black movies
Hollywood wants to make...

721
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,740
are ones with black Mamies in fat suits?

722
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,100
Or black women in pain, man?

723
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,300
So basically, we got
black people dying in the past...

724
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,845
and black people dying in the present.

725
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,201
Most people are here to see Fang 9.

726
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,500
It's got 2 Chainz in it.

727
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,409
Oh!

728
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:33,300
Would you stop stereotyping yourself
and put that down?

729
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,060
This ain't Friday, man.

730
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,940
Okay, whatever.
Yo, Sam...

731
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,980
We gotta... we gotta talk
about this protest, girl.

732
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:44,100
When are we taking the housing fight
to the president?

733
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,340
House folded on sponsoring the rally.

734
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,700
What do we need a sponsor for?

735
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,420
Demonstrations that aren't sponsored
by a house can get shut down.

736
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:53,100
What about the house
that you're head of?

737
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,660
Hey, Sam, I read Ebony and Ivy.

738
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,980
What's with the "oofta"
and "nose job" and "100" stuff?

739
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,860
You want me to break it down for you?

740
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,041
Yeah.

741
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,100
You want to know
an ideal Friday in my world?

742
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,220
A fifth of whiskey
and my T-Bone Walker records.

743
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,924
Real talk.

744
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,380
Yo, I'm sorry.

745
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,220
Who the fuck is T-Bone Walker?

746
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:15,140
Only the most influential pioneer...

747
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,540
of electric and jump blues, bro.
Know your roots, player.

748
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,260
There are only a few ways colored folks
can survive at a place like this.

749
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:25,020
White folks always be on stuff,
like, decades too late...

750
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,380
and then y'all want to try to act
like you discovered some shit.

751
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:30,370
An "oofta" is a jazz-age term...

752
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,060
for Bojangle types
who blacked it up for white audiences.

753
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,140
Rock, jazz, blues.

754
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,620
Nigga, what you got on right now?

755
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,820
Some PE.
Public Enemy, my nig...

756
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,260
No! Mm-mm.

757
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:42,980
Watch that, man.

758
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,180
Hey, you just called him.

759
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,140
Look, y'all get country clubs.

760
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,685
We get to say "nigger".

761
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:54,580
An oofta modulates his blackness
up or down depending on the crowd...

762
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:55,980
and what he wants from them.

763
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,100
What about golf, man?

764
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,540
Or all of our girls?

765
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:00,940
What do you mean, all your girls?

766
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,500
Well, there's O.J.
There's Wesley Snipes.

767
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,220
There's Tiger Woods.

768
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,020
- Troy over here.
- Exactly.

769
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,700
No, there's a word for that. Okay?

770
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:12,100
"Reparation."

771
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,043
Forty white bitches and a mule.

772
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,500
You know, I think Troy would be great
for the talk show...

773
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:18,647
don't you think, Kurt?

774
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,880
I fold.

775
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,900
Okay, and a nose job is a wannabe?

776
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,180
Sort of.

777
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,180
- Have you seen this?
- No.

778
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,220
Dear white people using Instagram.

779
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:38,300
You have an iPhone and you go on hikes.

780
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,846
I get it.

781
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,020
Nose jobs smooth their black edges
and try to blend in.

782
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,300
What's up, Mama?

783
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,528
Mm, don't talk like that.

784
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,980
Don't I know you from somewhere?

785
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,340
Hey, where do I know you from?

786
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,540
She was in the video.

787
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:56,180
- Oh, yeah, video girl.
- Check it out.

788
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,180
I hate to do it to you,
but I'm going to have to get...

789
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,100
real black with you for a second.

790
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,980
A nose job's worst fear
is that their blackness...

791
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,980
might cause a fuss
or draw undue attention...

792
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,048
so they use it to self-deprecate.

793
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,580
These white girls and their tans...

794
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,460
they're starting to
get darker than me...

795
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,289
which isn't that dark.

796
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:18,060
Hmm, 40,000 views already.

797
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,540
Looks like somebody
submitted you on Buzzfeed.

798
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,420
You're blowing up.

799
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:25,220
Hey, you want me to get you
a refill or something?

800
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,561
Let me guess.

801
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,860
You're from Ohio.

802
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:32,060
No, I'm actually from Vermont.

803
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,060
But the west side.

804
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,322
So what's your beef
with Dear White People?

805
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,020
Dear White People,
how do I feel about it?

806
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,380
It's blacker-than-thou propaganda...

807
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:48,087
from a bougie Lisa Bonet wannabe
who smells like patchouli.

808
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,820
But frankly, I can't believe
we're letting Sam get away with it.

809
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,340
That's awesome.

810
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,700
Seriously.

811
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:54,820
That's good.
That's nice.

812
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:55,740
And 100?

813
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,780
Just keeping it 100.

814
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,928
Just being black as hell, just 'cause.

815
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:03,540
What about just being yourself?

816
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:04,687
Like I said.

817
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,780
- You don't mind, do you?
- Of course not.

818
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,340
There are only a few ways
colored folks can survive...

819
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,487
at a place like this.

820
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:13,620
All right, so then what?

821
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,260
So then Sam says...

822
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,060
"ls Daddy scared that the negroes...

823
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,020
are going to start a rebellion
on the plantation?"

824
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:22,283
- To Kurt Fletcher.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

825
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,100
Okay, we've got a news item.

826
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,540
But there's something bigger here.

827
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,940
It's a profile piece...

828
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,540
on Armstrong-Parker
and Sam White's pseudo revolution.

829
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,860
What's the headline?

830
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,964
An outdated nationalist
seeks purpose, starts race war?

831
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,849
Beer is in the corner.

832
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,420
We'll bang out the news item tonight...

833
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,522
and we'll work on
the profile piece next week.

834
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,562
Yo, man.

835
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,820
Now you know
I wasn't talking about Soph...

836
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,940
with that whole 40 bitches thing, man.

837
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:59,460
- I was just, you know...
- Just what?

838
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:01,620
Just trying to get on my staff?

839
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,460
- I mean, I haven't really thought...
- Come on, bullshit.

840
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:07,340
Look, game night is when we make
our bids for the new staff, okay?

841
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,620
That's why this guy is here...

842
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,087
and why everybody's here.

843
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,180
I just think having good hair...

844
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,380
and carrying on
with a degree of sophistication...

845
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,140
doesn't make me a traitor to the race.

846
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,100
Absolutely.

847
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,980
You want to know why they
used to call me Black Mitch?

848
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:24,020
- Absolutely.
- Nobody called you that.

849
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:25,620
Come on, what were you
doing back there?

850
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:27,300
You're-you're practically sitting there.

851
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,140
You're about like to bust out
some kind of tap dance.

852
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,180
Come on, man.
I'm a Poli-Sci major, bro.

853
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,140
- I just came to hang out.
- It doesn't matter.

854
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:37,100
Either way. Look, either way
my staff, they like you.

855
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,884
A lot.

856
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:42,961
But you don't.

857
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,300
Look, this thing with you and Soph...

858
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,208
I'm good to her.

859
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,526
It doesn't matter.

860
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,049
Our dads have been playing
this chess match...

861
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,860
off and on since 1972.

862
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,620
What and Sophie is the white queen?

863
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,041
You're a pawn, Troy.

864
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:04,603
And maybe it's time
you got off the board.

865
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,980
Here's the deal.
Every year we throw a party.

866
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,606
Right? The whole point is to mock...

867
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:17,100
the self-important and moronic entities
of the campus.

868
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,300
Now, one way to get staffed...

869
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,402
is to write an invite for the party.

870
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:25,420
Our invites, they're-
they're freaking legendary.

871
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,980
You know, every year we make the Gawker.
We make the Post.

872
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,241
Tons of blogs.

873
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,580
The important thing is...

874
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:34,260
is if your invite is the one
that is picked to be sent out...

875
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:38,140
then you're guaranteed
a spot on our staff.

876
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,580
Okay.

877
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,180
So what is this year's theme?

878
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,380
It's...

879
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,940
I don't know.

880
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,460
Your party is, like, two weeks away.

881
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:48,180
Yeah, I know.

882
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:50,726
Kurt, I want you to meet someone.

883
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,526
You know Coco?

884
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,489
You guys got a party coming up?

885
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,444
Got to rally, Sam.
Time is now.

886
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:04,460
Reggie, use your head.

887
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,860
Do you really think that a rally
is going to change things?

888
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,980
It will do a hell of a lot more
than a radio show with views on YouTube.

889
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,780
Oh, okay.

890
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:15,700
Look... We got power.

891
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:18,180
Okay? And it's time we use it.

892
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:19,420
We earned it.

893
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,620
We? Oh, that's funny...

894
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,326
'cause I didn't see you
running for shit, Reggie.

895
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,245
Sam.

896
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,180
- Really?
- Tired.

897
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,009
Don't one word me.

898
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,260
Did we go too far?

899
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,700
Did we pass Armstrong-Parker?

900
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,700
No, I'm Garmin.

901
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,820
Fancy.

902
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,780
Why do you always got to...

903
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,882
snap at me all the time?

904
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,260
I'm around you 24/7 like a lapdog...

905
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:14,100
and I don't even really be messing
with no redbone chicks like that.

906
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,060
Don't call me that.

907
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,980
Girl, I thought you was
Puerto Rican when I met you.

908
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:17,860
Oh, okay.

909
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,500
Oh, you can dish it,
but you can't take it?

910
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:21,125
No, I'm taking my ass home.

911
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,762
George...

912
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,820
I'm not really down with Sam...

913
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,420
and I'm not in the BSU.

914
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,620
I got kicked out of Armstrong-Parker...

915
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,165
same as Kurt.

916
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,220
But I'm going to write a good article.

917
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,401
Okay?

918
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,500
Come on, Sam.

919
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,967
You know how I feel about you.

920
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,300
How am I supposed to know
how you feel about me?

921
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,970
You know what?

922
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:52,980
Forgive me if I see something in you...

923
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:55,128
something inspiring.

924
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:01,003
Some folks like me can get behind.

925
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,008
Tell me you'll set up the rally.

926
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,489
I'll set up the rally.

927
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:01,161
- Absolutely.
- Right? I think so.

928
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,180
I think...
I think it's bold.

929
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,380
I think it's ironic.

930
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:07,050
I think it's everything we need...

931
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:08,820
and don't tell me I'm the only one...

932
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:11,620
that thinks Sam White's little movement
needs to be cut down to size.

933
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:13,220
- Right, right?
- Yep.

934
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,580
Beautiful. Mitch?

935
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,380
You got your hip-hop party, man.

936
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,780
Bolly, bolly.

937
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,020
I'm telling you, man.

938
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:22,460
This is going to be huge.

939
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,820
Fucking epic.

940
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:26,460
If you'll excuse us...

941
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:28,260
we will be in touch.

942
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:29,900
Troy...

943
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,604
get off the board, man.

944
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,685
It was nice seeing you again.

945
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,205
Where's Sophia?

946
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,049
I have no idea.

947
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,603
Can't wait to see what story
you come up with.

948
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,285
Night, Lionel.

949
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,048
Ah-ah-ah-ah.

950
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:05,964
Party is not over.

951
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,060
It's two o'clock in the morning.

952
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,100
Sorry, bro.

953
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,645
Invitation only.

954
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,530
Trouble in paradise?

955
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,004
Figures.

956
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:55,260
Nothing.

957
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:58,260
I'm sure you have something else...

958
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:02,900
fair and petite and fair...

959
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,650
lined up for that drink.

960
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,489
And what's that supposed to mean?

961
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:17,940
Oh, no, really, it's fine.

962
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:20,520
I'm not even really
into black dudes anyway.

963
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:29,420
Coco, huh?

964
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,740
Colandrea doesn't exactly...

965
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:34,100
pass the resume test, you know?

966
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,020
Can you fucking die?

967
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:39,940
I mean, my parents really
should have just named me...

968
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:43,886
Ghetto-ass Hoodrat-ass Aneisha.

969
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,660
Do you indulge?

970
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,489
You know, it is 10 A.M.

971
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,090
I don't mess with that stuff.

972
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,881
You sure you don't like black guys?

973
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,260
Girl like me is just a placeholder...

974
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:16,886
for y'all at a place like this.

975
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:18,740
I'm not like that.

976
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,660
I don't think Sam would agree.

977
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,940
Poor thing.

978
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,691
She was light-skinned and everything.

979
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:31,126
Hell, I said it wasn't like that.

980
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,580
All right?

981
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:37,620
My Pops, he wanted me
with Fletcher's daughter.

982
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:41,460
Those two have been in competition
with each other ever since they went here.

983
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:44,420
He's not going to like you running
with those Pastiche boys, is he?

984
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:47,220
If I even get tapped.

985
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,810
You will.

986
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,440
You should do it.

987
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,100
They all land somewhere big...

988
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,521
some before they even graduate.

989
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:59,860
I've seen you in front
of a crowd, Troy.

990
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:02,361
I bet you could be famous.

991
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,084
So is that what you want?

992
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,445
To be famous?

993
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:15,340
I want people...

994
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,380
to know my name.

995
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,528
Which one?

996
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,300
"We want you.

997
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:36,643
"Come by Ellington
tomorrow at eight."

998
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,444
Anything?

999
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,240
Thanks.

1000
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,484
You're going to have to stand up
to him sooner or later.

1001
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,284
You said you loved me.

1002
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,683
I like you a lot.

1003
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:25,100
What do you do...

1004
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:28,020
when you go in the bathroom?

1005
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:30,282
Or is it just to get away from me?

1006
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:37,340
I smoke weed.

1007
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,681
And I write jokes.

1008
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:41,526
- What the hell are you doing here?
- This is my apartment.

1009
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:43,369
Like hell it is.

1010
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:47,180
- Dean said this was the only opening.
- Well, head of house doesn't share.

1011
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,362
But you're not head of house.

1012
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:14,884
Yo, come on, guys.
Are you serious?

1013
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:18,851
All right, all right,
I think they've had enough.

1014
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,740
Hello.

1015
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:46,140
Finally made it in.

1016
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:47,620
You moved around a lot, right?

1017
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:49,220
You must have been terrified...

1018
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:51,700
when you saw Armstrong-Parker
written on your moving assignment.

1019
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,220
I was just finishing up.

1020
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:56,500
- Do black people scare you?
- No.

1021
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,420
You're too scared
to even ask anyone for a cut.

1022
01:00:58,520 --> 01:00:59,726
I'm growing it out.

1023
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:01,340
He's growing it out.

1024
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:04,100
You're fostering an ecosystem.

1025
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,340
My man, how come you never come to BSU?

1026
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:09,860
I listen to Mumford & Sons
and watch Robert Altman movies.

1027
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,620
You really think
I'm black enough for the Union?

1028
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:14,740
Yeah, I love Robert Altman.

1029
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,220
Fucker goes in.

1030
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:17,620
All right.

1031
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:20,300
We're not all homophobes,
you know, black folks.

1032
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,060
I'm listening to Frank Ocean right now.

1033
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,300
I don't give a fuck.

1034
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,300
I'm-I'm late for class.

1035
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:28,340
Look, you're the new black voice
of the Bugle.

1036
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:30,568
We're just trying to figure out
if you're a friend or a foe.

1037
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,408
We got to protect our girl.

1038
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:36,900
I'm not even on staff.

1039
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,420
I mean, I have to make good
on my assignment.

1040
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:40,460
Assignment, what's the story?

1041
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:43,260
It's a profile piece
on black culture here at Winchester.

1042
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:45,328
Which you are so clearly an expert on.

1043
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:48,820
Tell me, man. What's harder?
Being black enough for the black kids...

1044
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:50,251
or black enough for the white ones?

1045
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:53,170
Being neither.

1046
01:01:58,520 --> 01:01:59,760
Really, Sam?

1047
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:40,406
Running late...

1048
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:43,366
for your little rally?

1049
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:47,420
Forget your sign?

1050
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:50,500
You honestly think this is in the spirit
of Armstrong-Parker house?

1051
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,500
The role of counterculture
is to wake up the mainstream.

1052
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:55,260
I have furniture older than you.

1053
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:56,980
Counterculture?

1054
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:59,060
Is that what you think this is?

1055
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:01,340
- Your little show?
- What about my show?

1056
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,780
Your show is racist.

1057
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:05,380
Black people can't be racist.

1058
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:08,020
Prejudiced, yes, but not racist.

1059
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:11,060
Racism describes a system
of disadvantage based on race.

1060
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:12,420
Black people can't be racist...

1061
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:15,180
since we don't stand
to benefit from such a system.

1062
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,408
Your antics are making press, Sam.

1063
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:21,020
And press like this keeps men
like President Fletcher up at night.

1064
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:22,700
Warm milk?

1065
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,540
He's building a file on you.

1066
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:27,660
Okay, it's not my fault that your son
couldn't beat me in an election.

1067
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:29,820
I'm sure it was tough growing up...

1068
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:31,900
wondering which side you fit into.

1069
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,810
Feeling like you have
to overcompensate, perhaps.

1070
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:42,260
If that's true, Dean...

1071
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:43,646
I'm not the only one.

1072
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,620
Hey, hey, hey, brother.

1073
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,529
There you are.

1074
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:03,340
That one over there.

1075
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:04,726
And that one over there.

1076
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:08,540
There you are.

1077
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:09,900
Thought we were supposed
to start at 12, right?

1078
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,540
Yeah, I told you I had class.

1079
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:13,260
This is going up on Gillespie.

1080
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:15,169
It's good, right?

1081
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:19,700
Oh, what's this?

1082
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:21,540
Yo, you ain't getting cold feet.

1083
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:24,803
No, but...
how long do I have to talk?

1084
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:27,140
You're kidding me, right?

1085
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:28,685
It's sort of the keynote.

1086
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:33,460
Look, Reggie, I think that the whole
Malcolm X thing is more your lane.

1087
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:34,340
I'm just not...

1088
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,488
These people came here to see you, Sam.

1089
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:39,251
Grab a bullhorn, turn it on.

1090
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:57,970
Hi. No, I'm kind of in the middle...

1091
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,440
Okay...

1092
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:10,967
Okay.

1093
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,001
Okay.

1094
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:32,886
I got to...

1095
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:35,562
You ready?

1096
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:46,611
Sam.

1097
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,060
Sam!

1098
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:53,100
Sam, you have our protest permits!

1099
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,440
Sam.

1100
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:58,020
Sam.

1101
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,740
Do you want me to tell him to go?

1102
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:03,180
- You're so tough.
- I will.

1103
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:04,940
No, I want you to wait
until they've gone...

1104
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:06,540
and then I want you to head home.

1105
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:08,100
I'm trying to be here for you.

1106
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,860
Can you be somewhere else for me?

1107
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:12,167
Sam, we know you're home.
We just want to talk.

1108
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:13,884
What do you see in him?

1109
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:18,720
The only eligible
single brother on campus.

1110
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:22,740
Okay, okay.

1111
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:24,922
No, I get it. Your parents
owned in Harlem, or something, right?

1112
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:26,700
You watched
Do The Right Thing in high school...

1113
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,700
and now you just want
to prove that you're down.

1114
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:29,500
I want to be down?

1115
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:31,100
How long does it take
to get your hair like that?

1116
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,460
Yo, Sam, open the door.

1117
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:36,260
I will call you tomorrow, Reggie!

1118
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:37,820
Damn.

1119
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,260
You don't understand.
Girls like me...

1120
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:41,100
What, have to pick a side?

1121
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,100
I'm sick of your tragic mulatto
bullshit, Sam.

1122
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,440
You can't say "mulatto."

1123
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:45,740
Mulatto, mulatto, mulatto!

1124
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:47,060
Did somebody say "mulatto"?

1125
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:48,740
Window. Go out the window.

1126
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:50,460
I'm sorry if I can't be
your Nubian prince...

1127
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:52,380
on my black horse ready to take you
back to fucking Zumunda.

1128
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:53,940
That's not a real African country.

1129
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:57,123
Can I at least get a little credit for
a solid Coming to America reference?

1130
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:01,180
This isn't you, Sam.

1131
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,521
No? And who am I?

1132
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:06,940
You're this... girl.

1133
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:08,420
Perceptive.

1134
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:11,220
Who likes to argue with me
about every fucking thing.

1135
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:13,820
And I hate it, because we both know
you're smarter than me.

1136
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:16,100
Your favorite director is Bergman...

1137
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:18,260
but you tell people it's Spike Lee.

1138
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:20,740
You love bebop, but you've
got a thing for Taylor Swift.

1139
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:22,780
I know, because my Mac
picks up your Mac's library.

1140
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:23,620
I was so careful.

1141
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:26,300
You like to watch me
when you think I'm sleeping...

1142
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,100
and trace the outlines of my face.

1143
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:29,620
We're ready to go, man!

1144
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:31,609
You're more Banksy than Barack...

1145
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:35,060
but you've been co-opted as some sort
of revolutionary leader or something?

1146
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:36,540
But really?

1147
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,260
You're an anarchist...

1148
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:41,500
shit starter, a beautiful filmmaker.

1149
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:43,380
And beautiful...

1150
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:44,561
in general.

1151
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:56,980
Yeah.

1152
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:58,605
Yeah?

1153
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:01,966
Yeah?

1154
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,125
Okay, get some sleep.

1155
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:11,570
Everything all right?

1156
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,763
His condition is stable.

1157
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:20,860
Good.

1158
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:22,962
That's good, Sam.

1159
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:25,765
Open the door!

1160
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:28,700
Sam!

1161
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:30,700
Gabe...

1162
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,370
What?

1163
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:40,090
Sorry.

1164
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:55,900
Your video is picking up steam.

1165
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,729
I told you I was good TV.

1166
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,700
Yeah, the show I'm scouting for...

1167
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:03,300
is called Black Face, White Place.

1168
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:05,220
It's a reality, like true life.

1169
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:07,580
Every episode focuses
on a different one of us...

1170
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:08,920
and the ceiling.

1171
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:10,420
Interesting.

1172
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:13,100
Interesting?

1173
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:15,140
You think they want
interesting, dignified stories...

1174
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:17,500
of triumph and survival? No.

1175
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:20,020
They want the authentic
urban experience...

1176
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:21,645
which is basically network talk...

1177
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:23,524
for bitching and weeping.

1178
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:28,420
I'm telling you this
because the network wants...

1179
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:30,700
to pick a certain subject
to go to series.

1180
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:34,180
We've got one episode,
one shot at that subject...

1181
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:37,011
- so if we do this...
- We do it all the way.

1182
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:40,900
Guessing Sam turned you down?

1183
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,540
I think so. She called me...

1184
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:45,220
a bojangling oofta, whatever that means.

1185
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:47,380
40,000 views, that's good...

1186
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:48,700
but it's not great.

1187
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:51,140
Well, I'm about to get a whole lot more.

1188
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:53,980
Look, we don't have anybody...

1189
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,540
like you and you had
a great idea, so we...

1190
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:59,060
I want to emcee it.

1191
01:09:59,160 --> 01:09:59,980
Your party.

1192
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:04,020
Okay. Okay, well...

1193
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:05,940
Look, we're here to talk to you
about what we want.

1194
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:07,380
You want me.

1195
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:09,140
And in order to get me...

1196
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:11,100
you have to let me emcee your party.

1197
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:14,020
Oh, and I'd also like to do
a live video blog...

1198
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:15,100
for my web series.

1199
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:16,500
Are they going to let you do that?

1200
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:18,329
They've got to.

1201
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:19,540
They need me.

1202
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:20,900
Without me...

1203
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,980
you guys look like a bunch
of privileged assholes.

1204
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:26,540
Right, well, we don't...
we don't really let people...

1205
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,500
"video blog" our-our events.

1206
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:30,580
Well...

1207
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:33,650
you got a week to put
this thing together, Boo-Boo.

1208
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:37,940
So what's it going to be?

1209
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:39,485
You look surprised.

1210
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:45,940
It's just not everyone
is as camera ready as you are.

1211
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:48,520
Get your game on
for only $3.99 a month.

1212
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:51,900
The important thing is...

1213
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,980
if your invite is the
one that is picked...

1214
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:56,845
to be sent out, then you are guaranteed
a spot on our staff.

1215
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:01,180
...for a low, low price.

1216
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:04,489
The sci-fi marathon
continues right now.

1217
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,100
Just over nine minutes to go
in this quarter.

1218
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:19,043
They need to score on this drive.

1219
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:22,611
Looking for the blitz, but he...

1220
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,206
Troy, come on in.

1221
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:43,650
Martin, share with Troy
what you've just shared with me.

1222
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:48,980
The server that processes the voting
results for house elections...

1223
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:51,048
has shut down the AP database.

1224
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:52,820
Apparently, the intermediary program...

1225
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:54,620
is on a refractile loop.

1226
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:57,300
I'm a Poli-Sci major, man.

1227
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:00,580
Sam currently has 445 votes.

1228
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:05,100
That's 200 more than she had
last week during the actual election.

1229
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:06,460
She cheated.

1230
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,100
She hacked the system.

1231
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:10,860
I wouldn't even know how
to do a thing like that.

1232
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:14,060
Is this little war of yours
really so important?

1233
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:17,180
Look, I understand the pressure to stand
for something in an institution like this...

1234
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:19,900
but you're barking up
the wrong tree. Okay?

1235
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,580
It had to have been Reggie.

1236
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:23,284
Guy's in my programming class.

1237
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:27,060
Good, just forgot
to turn his program off.

1238
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:29,380
Wow.

1239
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:31,403
You are the rightful head of house.

1240
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:35,420
So great.

1241
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:38,580
Martin, let me speak to Troy for a bit.

1242
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:41,420
I appreciate this.

1243
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:44,380
Your advisor tells me that you're
hanging on by a thread in your major.

1244
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:48,860
Maybe it's time for you to reprioritize.

1245
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:51,140
You're trying to frighten me...

1246
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:54,340
but I think you're the
one who is scared.

1247
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:57,620
And I think that you long for days...

1248
01:12:57,720 --> 01:13:00,740
when blacks were hanging from trees
and denied actual rights.

1249
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:04,660
That way you would have something
to actually fight against.

1250
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:06,740
You'll be facing two hearings
in the coming weeks...

1251
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:09,100
that could end in either
a suspension or probation.

1252
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:12,124
One on the merit of your show...

1253
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:16,180
the other on your election
to head of house.

1254
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:18,860
Your responsibilities
to your house are suspended.

1255
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:20,660
Your show is dead.

1256
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:23,980
And if there is another one
of your illegal demonstrations...

1257
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:26,380
it's going to get a lot worse.

1258
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,260
This is a critical time for this school.

1259
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:31,300
You're damn right it is.

1260
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:33,562
We don't have
an intolerance problem here.

1261
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:36,809
Except for the one I'm looking at.

1262
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:44,004
You didn't tell me that you and Sophia
had a misunderstanding.

1263
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:46,780
Who did?

1264
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:49,140
Her father.

1265
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:50,446
She was very upset.

1266
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:56,090
What vision do you have
for yourself, Troy?

1267
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:57,580
Get my degree...

1268
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:58,860
then law school, then...

1269
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,260
And what has that got to do...

1270
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:01,740
with partying with Kurt...

1271
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:04,140
smoking weed, and writing jokes?

1272
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:05,500
So okay, what is it?

1273
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:08,500
The spotlight that Kurt gets?

1274
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:10,220
You want to see yourself on TV?

1275
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,780
You know how many black men
waste their lives...

1276
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:15,420
trying to be on TV,
be rappers or ballplayers?

1277
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:18,460
Dad, no.
I want what we always talk about.

1278
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:20,483
Maybe have my own firm someday...

1279
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:21,700
run for office.

1280
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:23,900
Make a difference.

1281
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,321
What about the drugs?

1282
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:28,660
I have been in academia a long time.

1283
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:30,285
I've seen a lot of things.

1284
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:34,220
And the men who really run this world...

1285
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,180
oh...

1286
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:40,001
you've got no idea what they see
when they see you.

1287
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:43,620
You are not going to be
what they all think you are.

1288
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:46,849
You are not going to give them
that satisfaction.

1289
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:50,100
Do you hear me?

1290
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:51,326
Yes, sir.

1291
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:57,404
Get out of my sight.

1292
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:19,940
President's office.

1293
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:21,565
I'll be right there.

1294
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:36,460
I know about the party.

1295
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:38,060
What party?

1296
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:40,020
Yeah, cute.

1297
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:42,380
Let me tell you something.
You picked a hell of a time.

1298
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:44,860
- It's the Halloween party.
- I want you to listen to something.

1299
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:47,100
It's canceled, Kurt.
End of story.

1300
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:49,202
I can't cancel.
There's like 100 people coming.

1301
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:51,726
Hey.

1302
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:59,020
Lionel's story on the
would be protest...

1303
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:01,140
outside Gillespie is running tomorrow.

1304
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:03,380
Yeah, and I've also got Lionel
working on a profile piece...

1305
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:05,420
of Armstrong-Parker,
like you suggested.

1306
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:07,409
Really break down what's going on.

1307
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:10,700
Right?

1308
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:13,020
It's almost like they...

1309
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:15,020
recycle so much from their past.

1310
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:17,580
Music, food, fashion...

1311
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:21,060
and now turbulence.

1312
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:23,020
Thank you so much.

1313
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:25,260
Take care.

1314
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:27,980
- Well?
- That was our Times advisor.

1315
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:29,580
He said it's stories like these...

1316
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:31,921
that get editors
letters of recommendation.

1317
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:36,660
Negro at the door
didn't scare you this time?

1318
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:38,020
Lionel, please.

1319
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:39,940
You're only technically black.

1320
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:43,044
G? Going to French.

1321
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:46,607
- Should I save you a seat?
- Yeah, thanks.

1322
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:50,700
You need something?
I saw your email.

1323
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,140
Oh, yeah.

1324
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:56,100
I need someone to do
the donors event on Saturday.

1325
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:58,020
A small dinner
for the school's big givers.

1326
01:16:58,120 --> 01:16:59,980
That's Halloween night.

1327
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:03,140
Right, which is why
no one else will take it.

1328
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:05,820
Ah, thus the new guy.

1329
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:07,660
I'm going to class, but...

1330
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:10,020
you can stay and check out
last year's piece if you want.

1331
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:12,460
- You'll do fine.
- I don't know.

1332
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:15,140
Is there going to be any
racially fueled outbursts at this thing?

1333
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:16,526
You never know, right?

1334
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:24,689
Hey, am I a good writer?

1335
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:28,900
You'll get better.

1336
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,365
And we need you right now.

1337
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:34,660
Please, you're just
one big recommendation...

1338
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:35,940
away from the Times.

1339
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:37,485
Hey...

1340
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:57,940
There's a big party
after the donors event.

1341
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:01,340
Call me after.
Maybe we can hang?

1342
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,522
Yeah, yeah, sounds good.

1343
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:22,220
Dear white people...

1344
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:24,420
Are you tired of your humdrum
Wonder Bread existence...

1345
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:27,260
of accidental racism,
and wishing you could sip...

1346
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:29,300
on henny out your crunk cup...

1347
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:31,300
without a bitch
giving you the side eye?

1348
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:33,540
Of course you are.

1349
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:36,540
For all those looking
to unleash their inner negro...

1350
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:38,900
from years of bondage and oppression...

1351
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,100
Pastiche proudly presents...

1352
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:42,700
Dear White People...

1353
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:45,740
our 89th annual Hallows Eve
costume party...

1354
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:47,300
tonight at 10 Pacific time...

1355
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:50,180
or five colored people time.

1356
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:53,100
Dudes must rock Fubu, Ecko...

1357
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:55,180
Rocawear, or Sean John.

1358
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:57,540
XXXL is
the smallest sized T-shirt...

1359
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:58,580
you can wear...

1360
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:01,020
preferably with a collage
of Barack Obama...

1361
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:02,300
and Tupac on it.

1362
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:06,020
Ladies, we need to see
huge hoop earrings...

1363
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:08,780
long nails, and cheap, tight clothes.

1364
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:11,300
Proper hood rat starts fights,
speaks loudly...

1365
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:13,820
and when she can't think
of the words she's trying to say...

1366
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:17,180
just makes one up,
such as "edjmucated."

1367
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:19,940
Now feel free
to fry on up some chicken...

1368
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:21,860
bring some Kool-Aid, watermelon...

1369
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:24,820
forties, and of course,
that purple drank.

1370
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:27,300
Naturally, there will be
a freestyle rap competition...

1371
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:32,140
so bring it and join us
for the party of the year.

1372
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:34,140
Oh, and uh...

1373
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:37,100
Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga
nigga, nigga.

1374
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:39,043
Boy, that felt good.

1375
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:09,884
Funny seeing you here.

1376
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:15,805
Pops likes to show me off
at all these donor functions.

1377
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:21,525
So...

1378
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:24,260
Picard or Kirk?

1379
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:25,580
Kirk. Wait.

1380
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:26,681
- I didn't say...
- Yo.

1381
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:29,260
What happens at the crib
stays at the crib.

1382
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:31,300
I'm not trying to get my card revoked.

1383
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:33,260
Someone could say
that a show that had...

1384
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:37,540
Whoopi Goldberg, Michael Dorn,
and Kunta Kinte himself...

1385
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:39,260
was a pretty black show.

1386
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:43,140
- That work out for you?
- No, no, it did not.

1387
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:44,924
At least not in high school.

1388
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:49,380
Bet there's, like, a statue of you
in your high school.

1389
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:51,980
I was beloved.

1390
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,651
They know you were a Trekker?

1391
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:01,686
So what, you growing that out?

1392
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:05,044
I think it's gaining sentience.

1393
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:08,180
Yeah, it's out there.

1394
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:10,780
Yeah, it's like a black hole
for white people's fingers.

1395
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:14,100
They're... obsessed.

1396
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:16,900
I mean, you know I cut hair, though.

1397
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,445
So why don't you just ask me?

1398
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:23,460
I don't know. You're... you.

1399
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:26,140
Ly, you ready, man?

1400
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:28,620
Yeah. No costumes?

1401
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:30,580
I got a suit for this.

1402
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:32,020
We just got out of the staffroom.

1403
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:34,020
Yeah, we're going as overworked.

1404
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:37,602
- Where is it?
- Garmin House, on Third, I think.

1405
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:40,250
Third and Basin.

1406
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:43,002
I know it.

1407
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:47,404
Yo, man.

1408
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:51,540
If I'd have gone to your high school...

1409
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:52,801
I'd have had your back.

1410
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:51,340
This is kind of fucked up, right?

1411
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:54,420
Pastiche, the world's
most erudite boneheads.

1412
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:55,760
I need another drink.

1413
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:02,166
Hey.

1414
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:13,930
Sorry.

1415
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:18,060
It's all right. I just can't
wait to cut all of this off.

1416
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:19,082
Don't you dare.

1417
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:26,524
I could eat you like a Hershey's.

1418
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:33,969
I'll... I'll be right back.

1419
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:36,566
Okay.

1420
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:04,046
Sam.

1421
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:06,780
I hope to run for office someday.

1422
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:08,460
Make a difference, you know?

1423
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:10,369
If you guys will excuse me
for one moment.

1424
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:11,900
I promise I'll be right back.

1425
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,161
Hold that thought.

1426
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:28,220
So what do you want me to do?

1427
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:29,540
Go over and yell at them?

1428
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:31,051
Have you heard you yelling?

1429
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:35,860
For the first time in my life,
I can't just sit around...

1430
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:37,220
and do nothing.

1431
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:39,860
So... how can you?

1432
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:42,247
I'm done being everybody's
angry black chick.

1433
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:18,725
Hey, muffins.

1434
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:21,300
So how do I look?

1435
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:22,780
Tell me...

1436
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:25,486
why are white folks
so obsessed with being black?

1437
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:32,300
Hell, why are black folks addicted
to blonde Barbie doll weaves?

1438
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:35,483
The strange symbiosis
that we're here to investigate.

1439
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:52,220
Hi.

1440
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:54,500
How's it going?

1441
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:55,660
All right.

1442
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:57,020
This is-

1443
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:59,140
- Black Student Union.
- Black Student Union, yeah.

1444
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:01,940
- Yeah.
- 'Cause it's 7:30.

1445
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:04,940
It's your call, man.

1446
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:07,900
All right, all right...

1447
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,660
All right, y'all.
Thanks for coming out.

1448
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:14,300
Tonight, looks like Sam
is not going to make it...

1449
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:16,687
so let's call it.

1450
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:28,900
Um, hi.

1451
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:32,340
I'm Lionel.

1452
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:35,500
I know some of you.

1453
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:36,980
None of you know me.

1454
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:39,765
I've never been to a meeting.
I plan on coming.

1455
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:47,660
I just came from this party...

1456
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:49,649
and I feel like you guys
should know about it.

1457
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:01,540
Hey, Kurt.
What's up, man?

1458
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:03,100
- How you doing?
- What the fuck is going on?

1459
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:04,725
All these people just showed up, man.

1460
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:11,700
Wait, who am I?

1461
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:16,380
"Bitch, it's weave, noun,
present tense, how."

1462
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,130
Okay, point taken.

1463
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:29,220
- Hey, man, you want a drink?
- Shut up.

1464
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:33,940
- Yeah.
- Kurt, it's me.

1465
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:34,940
I can't do this.

1466
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:37,700
Okay, I'm fucking confused.

1467
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:40,900
- Dad.
- Not now, Troy.

1468
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,340
But Dad, it's important.

1469
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:44,204
I heard there's something
happening on campus...

1470
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:46,100
and I might have been a part
of setting it off.

1471
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:48,009
Son, you're being rude.

1472
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:50,820
Oh, am I?

1473
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:53,002
Well, how about I tell
all your precious donors...

1474
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:54,220
and anybody who will listen

1475
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:56,060
what kind of school it is
they're giving to!

1476
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:57,740
What is wrong with you?

1477
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:59,180
How dare you?

1478
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:01,380
You can't come over here
and talk to your father...

1479
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:03,100
All I say is "Yes, sir"
and "No, sir."

1480
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:05,140
Now look, I should have
brought this to you earlier...

1481
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:06,540
but I didn't know what to do.

1482
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:08,802
- Okay, let's wait.
- Listen to me!

1483
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:11,521
Done right, brother.

1484
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:14,220
What's the plan?

1485
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:16,220
We go over there.

1486
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:17,860
Now.

1487
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:19,700
Think there's enough of us?

1488
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:22,020
Latinos United
is meeting across the hall.

1489
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:23,565
Asian-American League, too.

1490
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:28,008
You guys got better snacks.

1491
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:50,140
Wait, what?

1492
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:52,780
Yeah, dude, we all got it.

1493
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:54,928
I mean, everything is cool, right?

1494
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:04,780
Take that shit off!

1495
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:07,167
Take that fucking shit off.

1496
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:13,540
Wait, what the fuck are you doing, man?

1497
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:15,820
Jesus!

1498
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:17,900
We're putting an end to this, Kurt.

1499
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,460
You know what?
Everybody get the fuck out of my house.

1500
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:22,767
Okay? I'm calling the cops.

1501
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:52,170
Let's make it do what it do!

1502
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:56,780
One, two, one, two, three.

1503
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:59,300
Yo, give me your wife before I slap ya.

1504
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:00,970
I've been looking for some dames...

1505
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:02,740
but there's not another chapter.

1506
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:04,980
You can do me slow, you can do me fast.

1507
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:07,580
You can add it to my league.
I'm the royalty to ask for.

1508
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:10,570
One, two, wa-wa-wa-one.

1509
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:13,980
I say hey!

1510
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:15,380
Hey!

1511
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:17,562
- Ho!
- Ho!

1512
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:19,060
My name is Lionel.

1513
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:20,340
Some call me Ly.

1514
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:22,700
Most people think I kind of talk quiet.

1515
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:25,140
But that's all right, that's all cool.

1516
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:28,084
I'd rather be white
than tap dance with you.

1517
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:47,660
Get the fuck out of my house.

1518
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:49,569
- What you doing?
- Get the fuck out of here!

1519
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:16,326
What?

1520
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:18,780
Say it.

1521
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:19,927
Come on.

1522
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:24,260
You know, this may come
as a shock to you...

1523
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:27,842
but these people don't give a fuck
about no Harriet motherfucking Tubman.

1524
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:29,700
They pay millions of dollars...

1525
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:31,660
on their lips, their tans...

1526
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:34,180
their asses, Jay-Z tickets...

1527
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:36,260
because they want to be like us.

1528
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:39,460
And they got to be for a night.

1529
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:41,300
I'm not about to go out
into the streets...

1530
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:44,210
and protest a fucking Halloween party.

1531
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:02,860
He can't help it.

1532
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:05,850
But why do you have to be such a fag?

1533
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:34,921
Looks like you got me
right where you want me, huh?

1534
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,729
Hey...

1535
01:34:06,760 --> 01:34:10,003
I didn't do this, Sam.
I didn't do this.

1536
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:12,380
Outrage over an African-American
themed party...

1537
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,740
has resulted in rioting
and property damages.

1538
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:17,764
Naturally, a dozen
colored folks crashing a party...

1539
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:20,020
was dubbed a riot, but nevertheless...

1540
01:34:20,120 --> 01:34:21,620
the story made national news.

1541
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:23,340
I'm sorry.

1542
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:26,060
We don't condone
this egregious event, believe me.

1543
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:28,300
Dean Fairbanks and I are looking
into different ways...

1544
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:30,482
to address issues of diversity...

1545
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:34,260
- Housing reform!
- Yeah!

1546
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:36,140
Housing reform.

1547
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:37,940
I mean, the fact that
we can joke about this...

1548
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:39,740
proves we moved on, obviously, right?

1549
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:42,100
I mean, in this day and age,
if you can't take a joke...

1550
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:45,940
Shit, I'm just saying this is
an attack on my freedom of speech.

1551
01:34:46,040 --> 01:34:47,140
I'm the victim here!

1552
01:34:47,240 --> 01:34:49,460
The campus was divided.

1553
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:52,580
Was the party an act of free speech,
or was it racism?

1554
01:34:52,680 --> 01:34:55,540
I mean, this is only a debate
because of who Kurt's dad is...

1555
01:34:55,640 --> 01:34:58,140
which just proves the point.

1556
01:34:58,240 --> 01:35:00,940
I mean, all you did was have a radio
show and look what happened to you.

1557
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:04,380
This may come as a shock to you but
these people don't give a fuck...

1558
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:07,180
about no Harriet motherfucking Tubman.

1559
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:09,340
They want to be like us.

1560
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:11,300
And they got to be for a night.

1561
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:12,980
Of course I got my dad involved.

1562
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:14,940
It was the right thing to do.

1563
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:17,780
And now all of these posters
just started showing up.

1564
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:19,820
I mean, why settle for head of house...

1565
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:22,340
when there's a need for me
as president, you know?

1566
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:24,204
Dear white people...

1567
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:31,005
You know what?

1568
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:35,170
Never mind.

1569
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:02,289
When I heard
what the group was planning...

1570
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:04,380
I emailed my staff
and I told them to quit.

1571
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:06,540
That is a copy of the email
in front of you.

1572
01:36:06,640 --> 01:36:07,641
And who's this?

1573
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:10,962
My lawyer.

1574
01:36:12,120 --> 01:36:15,920
So when I got the invite
and saw everyone clicking yes...

1575
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:17,500
I figured it was back on.

1576
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:20,220
- We know you were planning this.
- Your son tell you that?

1577
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:22,660
"Wishing you could sip on
henny out your crunk cup...

1578
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:24,728
"without a bitch
giving you the side eye."

1579
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:26,580
You write this, Troy?

1580
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:28,780
No.

1581
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:30,940
- Mine wasn't chosen.
- But you wanted to be.

1582
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:33,520
What I wanted didn't matter then,
so why should it matter now?

1583
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:35,940
I'm the one who got you
to send the police, remember?

1584
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:39,140
The invite came
from the Pastiche Facebook account.

1585
01:36:39,240 --> 01:36:41,220
I canceled the party!

1586
01:36:41,320 --> 01:36:43,780
You got to believe me.

1587
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:46,360
What were your intentions
when you went back the second time?

1588
01:36:46,920 --> 01:36:48,160
To stop it.

1589
01:36:48,280 --> 01:36:49,850
By any means necessary?

1590
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:52,900
Someone once told me that...

1591
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,260
Winchester was like jazz.

1592
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:56,740
Now I don't know much about jazz...

1593
01:36:56,840 --> 01:36:58,700
but from what I can tell...

1594
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:01,849
when your solo is up...

1595
01:37:01,960 --> 01:37:04,008
you better blow.

1596
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:06,580
You want to hear something strange?

1597
01:37:06,680 --> 01:37:09,020
The Pastiche group page
hadn't been used for months...

1598
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:10,380
until the invite went out.

1599
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:11,641
Why am I even here?

1600
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:13,460
What's interesting
is how easy it was...

1601
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:15,380
to access the group page.

1602
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:18,980
The password was "pa$tiche"
spelled with a dollar sign...

1603
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:20,411
according to Kurt...

1604
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:22,980
but it seems
it's recently been changed.

1605
01:37:23,080 --> 01:37:25,060
I couldn't figure it out at first.

1606
01:37:25,160 --> 01:37:27,020
Then I thought to try something.

1607
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:33,127
578-35-26-196.

1608
01:37:33,240 --> 01:37:35,820
Eleven numbers.

1609
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:37,684
Just like our student I.D. numbers.

1610
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:43,763
Just like your student I.D. number.

1611
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:48,820
As much as you hate him,
you will stop at nothing...

1612
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:51,380
to protect your master and his boy.

1613
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:53,847
Did you send out the invite, Sam?

1614
01:37:57,240 --> 01:38:00,340
It wasn't speeches that turned
the tide for civil rights.

1615
01:38:00,440 --> 01:38:03,100
It was the anarchists willing
to provoke the police...

1616
01:38:03,200 --> 01:38:04,326
get sprayed by hoses...

1617
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:06,860
anything to cause a scene
and make press.

1618
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:09,780
That invite, whoever sent it...

1619
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:12,020
should have been met
with derision and outrage.

1620
01:38:12,120 --> 01:38:14,300
Instead, 100 people, your students...

1621
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:16,460
showed up,
and they pulled out posters...

1622
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:18,050
and decorations and costumes...

1623
01:38:18,160 --> 01:38:19,620
that they had made for such an event...

1624
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:21,060
and they showed our school...

1625
01:38:21,160 --> 01:38:23,401
exactly where it's at.

1626
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:08,802
Well, you've made some new friends.

1627
01:39:09,800 --> 01:39:11,564
I guess you could call them that.

1628
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:15,602
- So...
- No, not right now.

1629
01:39:15,720 --> 01:39:16,721
Not here.

1630
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:23,806
- Fine.
- Oh, come on, Coco.

1631
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:26,580
Fuck you, Troy.

1632
01:39:26,680 --> 01:39:28,364
Look, my dad saw your videos...

1633
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:29,860
and he's just a little worried...

1634
01:39:29,960 --> 01:39:32,060
How it will look?

1635
01:39:32,160 --> 01:39:33,889
With your campaign and all?

1636
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:43,321
What's your best friend Reggie think?

1637
01:39:46,360 --> 01:39:50,660
Hey... we had fun.

1638
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:52,569
All right?

1639
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:02,780
You know, I get that everybody else
wants you to win, Troy.

1640
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:04,245
But do you?

1641
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:24,844
Hello, Sam.

1642
01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:29,500
I read about Armstrong-Parker.

1643
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:32,180
Yeah, Pres. made
an executive withdrawal...

1644
01:40:32,280 --> 01:40:34,580
so Armstrong stays black.

1645
01:40:34,680 --> 01:40:36,728
Congrats.

1646
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:39,540
I don't know. It's getting
a little too dramatic, man.

1647
01:40:39,640 --> 01:40:43,700
I'm thinking about getting
an apartment off campus.

1648
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:45,484
So we'll see.

1649
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:48,500
Sam White going
against the grain? Shocking.

1650
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:52,020
How's Papa White?

1651
01:40:52,120 --> 01:40:53,884
- Recovering.
- Good.

1652
01:40:58,520 --> 01:40:59,169
Well...

1653
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:02,220
We were actually
on the phone last night...

1654
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:04,004
for hours.

1655
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:07,580
It was the first time
we talked since the bypass.

1656
01:41:07,680 --> 01:41:10,100
And he was putting up a strong front...

1657
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:12,300
teasing me about being so worried.

1658
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:15,722
And then came the stories
about me as a little girl...

1659
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:18,060
that I'd heard 1,000 times.

1660
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:21,926
About how...

1661
01:41:24,360 --> 01:41:27,045
independent I was.

1662
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:30,731
Want to talk about it?

1663
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:35,324
My mom worked nights...

1664
01:41:35,440 --> 01:41:40,860
so he'd always
take me to school, and...

1665
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:42,700
it used to piss me off...

1666
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:45,860
because he'd follow me
all the way to homeroom.

1667
01:41:45,960 --> 01:41:47,500
And whenever he'd try
to hold my hand...

1668
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:51,660
I'd scream and... pull it away.

1669
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:55,100
The students and the parents...

1670
01:41:55,200 --> 01:41:57,940
they'd see this white man...

1671
01:41:58,040 --> 01:42:00,820
and this black girl...

1672
01:42:00,920 --> 01:42:02,980
and they'd wonder
what we were doing together.

1673
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:07,420
Even at nine, I could feel
their eyes on me.

1674
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:09,443
And I was just a bratty girl.

1675
01:42:09,560 --> 01:42:13,167
I didn't know any better,
but the thought of losing him...

1676
01:42:14,680 --> 01:42:16,780
You know?

1677
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:19,500
I, um...

1678
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:22,968
I just feel so bad.

1679
01:42:26,760 --> 01:42:31,220
How awful am I to do that to...

1680
01:42:31,320 --> 01:42:35,120
him, or to anyone...

1681
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:38,170
that I...

1682
01:42:40,240 --> 01:42:42,004
love.

1683
01:42:47,480 --> 01:42:50,006
I'm sure he forgives you.

1684
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:53,445
You think so?

1685
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:03,300
So anyway, I don't know...

1686
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:06,006
why I said all that.

1687
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:09,570
Sam, where are you going?

1688
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:14,725
I don't know.

1689
01:43:16,680 --> 01:43:18,808
Lunch.

1690
01:43:18,920 --> 01:43:21,366
Isn't it Mac N' Cheese day
at Armstrong-Parker?

1691
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:26,524
You think they'll let you in?

1692
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:54,220
Let me get this straight.

1693
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:55,924
First you try to break up
the black house.

1694
01:43:56,040 --> 01:43:58,740
Then you take down the sister
with the little radio show.

1695
01:43:58,840 --> 01:44:00,420
Then after all of that...

1696
01:44:00,520 --> 01:44:02,900
- your son throws a blackface party.
- Now wait a minute.

1697
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,340
Now if you thought you were
having trouble finding money before...

1698
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:07,740
just wait until cable news
gets their hands on this story.

1699
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:09,980
I mean, Bill Maher
is going to fuck you up.

1700
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:12,780
You know, I've heard enough. I'm sorry.

1701
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:16,020
Look, the point is
from where I'm sitting...

1702
01:44:16,120 --> 01:44:17,900
- this place is a gold mine.
- What?

1703
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,700
Well, we still need the stuff
that leads up to the party.

1704
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:21,780
That happened already.

1705
01:44:21,880 --> 01:44:23,180
Well yeah, we can re-enact it.

1706
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:24,100
Re-enact.

1707
01:44:24,200 --> 01:44:25,900
It's a documentary term.
I...

1708
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,980
The point is, I could be
putting together an overall deal today.

1709
01:44:29,080 --> 01:44:32,050
I am talking real money.

1710
01:44:32,160 --> 01:44:34,540
Turns out the only thing
Americans love in their reality TV...

1711
01:44:34,640 --> 01:44:37,340
more than ignorant black kids
is crazy racist white folks.

1712
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:38,820
Now look here.

1713
01:44:38,920 --> 01:44:41,260
This is an honorable institution.

1714
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:44,330
The idea that we would
so much as entertain...

1715
01:44:46,160 --> 01:44:47,446
How much we talking?
