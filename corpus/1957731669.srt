1
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:47,714
- All right, Shell,

2
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,964
we're live in five, four, three, two...

3
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:55,354
- Are ghosts real?

4
00:00:55,354 --> 00:00:57,235
Do they exist?

5
00:00:57,235 --> 00:00:59,867
Some experts believe ghosts
to be the disembodied spirits

6
00:00:59,867 --> 00:01:01,768
or trapped souls of the deceased,

7
00:01:01,768 --> 00:01:05,721
while others theorize that
they are in fact demons

8
00:01:05,721 --> 00:01:08,696
attempting to break through
our plane of existence

9
00:01:08,696 --> 00:01:12,236
and exert their influence
on the human world.

10
00:01:12,236 --> 00:01:15,121
Now whether they be spirits or demons,

11
00:01:15,121 --> 00:01:19,141
the bigger question is what do they want,

12
00:01:19,141 --> 00:01:22,141
and how do we communicate with them?

13
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,432
Tonight, my team and I
have enlisted the help

14
00:01:26,432 --> 00:01:29,616
of a renowned Native American medium

15
00:01:29,616 --> 00:01:33,763
to help us tear down the
walls between realities

16
00:01:33,763 --> 00:01:36,648
and open the doorway between our world

17
00:01:36,648 --> 00:01:38,704
and the world of the dead.

18
00:01:38,704 --> 00:01:40,454
Directly behind us...

19
00:01:41,715 --> 00:01:42,548
Louis!

20
00:01:42,548 --> 00:01:43,381
Man, what are you doing?

21
00:01:43,381 --> 00:01:44,214
I was on a roll there.

22
00:01:44,214 --> 00:01:45,736
- Hold up, man, I got
some shit on my lens.

23
00:01:45,736 --> 00:01:46,736
- Hurry up.

24
00:01:46,736 --> 00:01:47,668
- What are you complaining about?

25
00:01:47,668 --> 00:01:50,456
This beats digging ditches for dad, right?

26
00:01:50,456 --> 00:01:51,680
- Unless you want me
to go to the dark side,

27
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,152
let's not talk about dad right now.

28
00:01:54,152 --> 00:01:57,918
- Man, you're being
really undue right now.

29
00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:59,845
- Fuck, where was I?

30
00:01:59,845 --> 00:02:03,348
- The our door
into their door thing.

31
00:02:03,348 --> 00:02:05,098
- Right, right, okay.

32
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:07,226
Is the hotel in frame?

33
00:02:07,226 --> 00:02:08,726
- Oh yeah.

34
00:02:09,683 --> 00:02:11,252
There, yep,

35
00:02:11,252 --> 00:02:13,051
and there you are.

36
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:14,003
Hi.

37
00:02:14,003 --> 00:02:15,170
Still rolling.

38
00:02:16,834 --> 00:02:20,835
- Directly behind me
is the Don Park Hotel.

39
00:02:20,835 --> 00:02:22,784
Now it may not look like much right now,

40
00:02:22,784 --> 00:02:25,235
but this hotel is widely considered

41
00:02:25,235 --> 00:02:29,841
to be one of the most terrifying
places in Northern America.

42
00:02:29,841 --> 00:02:33,521
Tonight, my team and I will put
our reputations on the line,

43
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:38,331
to find indisputable evidence
to prove to you, our fans,

44
00:02:38,331 --> 00:02:42,026
that otherworldly
entities really do exist.

45
00:02:42,026 --> 00:02:45,846
Ladies and gentlemen,
believers and skeptics,

46
00:02:45,846 --> 00:02:48,962
welcome to our final webisode.

47
00:02:48,962 --> 00:02:51,545
This is The Perfect Apparition.

48
00:02:53,754 --> 00:02:54,587
And cut!

49
00:02:55,786 --> 00:02:57,074
Okay, how was that?

50
00:02:57,074 --> 00:02:58,016
- You're like the lovechild

51
00:02:58,016 --> 00:03:00,817
of Ryan Seacrest and Joe Rogan, man.

52
00:03:00,817 --> 00:03:02,251
- Can you please be serious for a minute?

53
00:03:02,251 --> 00:03:03,084
- What?

54
00:03:03,084 --> 00:03:04,704
Come on.

55
00:03:04,704 --> 00:03:05,822
- This has gotta be killer, bro.

56
00:03:05,822 --> 00:03:09,652
I've got way too much riding on this.

57
00:03:09,652 --> 00:03:10,900
I'm an award-winning filmmaker

58
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,051
and they've got me out
here in Buttfuck, Egypt.

59
00:03:13,051 --> 00:03:15,785
People are expecting more from me.

60
00:03:15,785 --> 00:03:17,171
- First off, it was a short film,

61
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:19,553
and second off, what people, man?

62
00:03:19,553 --> 00:03:20,604
Some web series?

63
00:03:20,604 --> 00:03:22,672
No one watches.

64
00:03:22,672 --> 00:03:23,876
- You just don't get it.

65
00:03:23,876 --> 00:03:24,924
It's make it or break it time,

66
00:03:24,924 --> 00:03:26,996
and I'm the guy the network is looking

67
00:03:26,996 --> 00:03:28,441
to pull a ghost out of his hat.

68
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:29,780
- All right, man, look,
I was just messing with you.

69
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,659
You look great, the show's gonna rock.

70
00:03:31,659 --> 00:03:33,161
Trust me.

71
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:34,484
- I don't look fat?

72
00:03:34,484 --> 00:03:36,828
- No, you look great, trim, fit.

73
00:03:36,828 --> 00:03:37,996
- Fucking fat.

74
00:03:37,996 --> 00:03:39,613
- No, that whole

75
00:03:39,613 --> 00:03:42,565
zone time's
really paying off, man.

76
00:03:42,565 --> 00:03:45,217
- It must be really nice
having a job with no pressure.

77
00:03:45,217 --> 00:03:47,419
- Wait, what the
fuck do you mean no pressure?

78
00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:50,469
- You pull the trigger on
a fucking camera, Louis.

79
00:03:50,469 --> 00:03:52,372
- Man, that's not cool.

80
00:03:52,372 --> 00:03:53,205
- You know what?

81
00:03:53,205 --> 00:03:54,843
Give me that thing.

82
00:03:54,843 --> 00:03:55,676
- Be careful with that.

83
00:03:55,676 --> 00:03:56,989
That's an expensive camera.

84
00:03:56,989 --> 00:03:58,871
- A trained
monkey could do your job.

85
00:03:58,871 --> 00:03:59,986
Is this thing even on?

86
00:03:59,986 --> 00:04:01,309
- My camera's like New York, dog.

87
00:04:01,309 --> 00:04:02,838
It never sleeps.

88
00:04:02,838 --> 00:04:04,120
- You think you can do what I do?

89
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,953
All right.

90
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:05,786
- Yeah, I do.

91
00:04:05,786 --> 00:04:08,924
- Three, two, rolling, go.

92
00:04:08,924 --> 00:04:10,241
- Are ghosts real?

93
00:04:10,241 --> 00:04:11,475
Do they exist?

94
00:04:11,475 --> 00:04:12,308
Some experts think--

95
00:04:12,308 --> 00:04:13,141
- Shut up!

96
00:04:13,141 --> 00:04:13,974
- What?

97
00:04:13,974 --> 00:04:14,807
You're not gonna let me do it?

98
00:04:14,807 --> 00:04:15,685
- No, you're
such a fucking asshole.

99
00:04:15,685 --> 00:04:17,146
- I'm just messing
around, man, come on.

100
00:04:17,146 --> 00:04:18,037
- Yeah, it's not funny.

101
00:04:18,037 --> 00:04:19,433
- Don't be mad.

102
00:04:19,433 --> 00:04:20,266
- There's Paige.

103
00:04:20,266 --> 00:04:21,515
- Hey, don't run away mad.

104
00:04:21,515 --> 00:04:22,452
I love you.

105
00:04:22,452 --> 00:04:24,620
- Oh, yeah, I love you.

106
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,707
- Say it like you mean it.

107
00:04:25,707 --> 00:04:26,540
- Love you.

108
00:04:27,373 --> 00:04:28,326
- Hey guys, how's it going?

109
00:04:28,326 --> 00:04:30,275
- What's the holdup?

110
00:04:30,275 --> 00:04:31,805
- Shelly, please, I've
been running around all day

111
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:35,136
trying to get everything
together for tonight's shoot.

112
00:04:35,136 --> 00:04:37,953
I'm tired, I'm cold, and I'm hungry.

113
00:04:37,953 --> 00:04:38,786
- Somebody woke up

114
00:04:38,786 --> 00:04:42,233
on the wrong side of the rental car.

115
00:04:42,233 --> 00:04:43,751
- So?

116
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:44,775
- I have your crew.

117
00:04:44,775 --> 00:04:45,608
They're great.

118
00:04:45,608 --> 00:04:47,856
They're in the car filling out paperwork.

119
00:04:47,856 --> 00:04:48,689
- And?

120
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:51,113
- I told them we'd
pay them after we wrap.

121
00:04:51,113 --> 00:04:52,817
- How much?

122
00:04:52,817 --> 00:04:55,067
- You said 250 each.

123
00:04:55,067 --> 00:04:57,050
- No, I said 150.

124
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,377
- No, I have it right here.

125
00:04:59,377 --> 00:05:03,544
On the 5th at 4:00pm, you
said you'd give them 250.

126
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:08,594
- You need to be a little
bit more budget-conscious.

127
00:05:08,594 --> 00:05:09,601
- Do you have it or not?

128
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:11,268
I already told them.

129
00:05:12,328 --> 00:05:13,395
- Stop freaking out, babe.

130
00:05:13,395 --> 00:05:14,585
I've got it.

131
00:05:14,585 --> 00:05:15,418
- Don't say that.

132
00:05:15,418 --> 00:05:16,331
I hate that.

133
00:05:16,331 --> 00:05:18,285
I only freak out because of you two.

134
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:19,118
- Me?

135
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:19,951
What did I do?

136
00:05:19,951 --> 00:05:20,784
Just running camera here.

137
00:05:20,784 --> 00:05:21,617
- We're gonna produce it.

138
00:05:21,617 --> 00:05:22,450
- Shelly, I can't pay them in cash.

139
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,401
I have to keep a record of everything.

140
00:05:24,401 --> 00:05:27,355
- Not my problem.

141
00:05:27,355 --> 00:05:28,472
Give me some love.

142
00:05:28,472 --> 00:05:30,438
- Come on, let's go.

143
00:05:30,438 --> 00:05:32,723
Why don't you just let
me handle the money?

144
00:05:32,723 --> 00:05:34,958
- No, because
then you'd be in charge

145
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:37,208
of the strippers and booze.

146
00:05:39,475 --> 00:05:42,058
- So this is our crew.

147
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,248
- Okay.

148
00:05:50,248 --> 00:05:53,816
Jackson, Elsa, Malia, this is
Shelly Dewise, our director,

149
00:05:53,816 --> 00:05:58,269
and this is Louis, his brother,
obviously the cameraman.

150
00:05:58,269 --> 00:05:59,223
- Here's your paperwork.

151
00:05:59,223 --> 00:06:00,375
- Thanks for coming out tonight.

152
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:04,208
It's really hard to find
good help these days.

153
00:06:06,765 --> 00:06:08,348
- Shelly?

154
00:06:09,591 --> 00:06:10,813
- Yeah.

155
00:06:10,813 --> 00:06:12,396
It's a family name.

156
00:06:13,647 --> 00:06:14,730
- Your mom's?

157
00:06:16,685 --> 00:06:19,335
I'm just messing with you, man.

158
00:06:19,335 --> 00:06:20,168
- No actually you're right,

159
00:06:20,168 --> 00:06:23,637
it was our mom's name.

160
00:06:23,637 --> 00:06:24,554
Sorry, bro.

161
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:26,591
- Hi.

162
00:06:26,591 --> 00:06:27,456
I'm Malia.

163
00:06:27,456 --> 00:06:28,357
Nice to meet you.

164
00:06:28,357 --> 00:06:29,308
- Pleasure.

165
00:06:29,308 --> 00:06:30,790
- I'm a really big fan of your work.

166
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:32,624
- Hi.

167
00:06:32,624 --> 00:06:34,966
- Thank you.

168
00:06:34,966 --> 00:06:37,278
What have you seen?

169
00:06:37,278 --> 00:06:39,685
- The documentary you did on autopsies,

170
00:06:39,685 --> 00:06:43,316
the one where the skin just
peeled off that corpse's body,

171
00:06:43,316 --> 00:06:44,733
that was amazing.

172
00:06:46,551 --> 00:06:47,615
- Thank you very much.

173
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,535
A lot of people didn't
quite get how we did that.

174
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:51,903
- Yeah, I shot that.

175
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,386
- No you didn't.

176
00:06:53,386 --> 00:06:54,236
I shot that.

177
00:06:54,236 --> 00:06:55,117
- I was there the whole,

178
00:06:55,117 --> 00:06:55,950
I shot the whole--

179
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,686
- You need to stop
telling people this stuff.

180
00:06:57,686 --> 00:07:00,290
I hate when you do this to me.

181
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,123
Thank you.

182
00:07:01,123 --> 00:07:02,108
I really appreciate that.

183
00:07:02,108 --> 00:07:02,941
- Genius.

184
00:07:02,941 --> 00:07:03,973
I think you're a genius.

185
00:07:03,973 --> 00:07:07,768
I can't wait to see
what you shoot tonight.

186
00:07:07,768 --> 00:07:10,413
- Yeah, speaking of which,
where's the man with the keys?

187
00:07:10,413 --> 00:07:12,029
- AJ, caretaker.

188
00:07:12,029 --> 00:07:14,428
- Wasn't he supposed
to be here two hours ago?

189
00:07:14,428 --> 00:07:16,187
- Yeah, I don't know where he is.

190
00:07:16,187 --> 00:07:18,268
- Maybe you should call him.

191
00:07:18,268 --> 00:07:19,669
- I'm doing that right now, Shelly.

192
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:20,502
- Great.

193
00:07:20,502 --> 00:07:21,335
- While I'm doing that,

194
00:07:21,335 --> 00:07:23,503
why don't we start shooting some B roll

195
00:07:23,503 --> 00:07:26,016
and introduce the new team members, hmm?

196
00:07:26,016 --> 00:07:28,335
- All righty then.

197
00:07:28,335 --> 00:07:29,444
Why don't we start with you?

198
00:07:29,444 --> 00:07:30,644
Malia?

199
00:07:30,644 --> 00:07:32,078
- Malia.

200
00:07:32,078 --> 00:07:33,724
Malia.

201
00:07:33,724 --> 00:07:34,557
- Okay.

202
00:07:34,557 --> 00:07:37,257
Just go ahead and speak
right in the camera for me.

203
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:38,474
- Oh.

204
00:07:38,474 --> 00:07:39,307
Okay.

205
00:07:43,904 --> 00:07:44,788
Hi.

206
00:07:44,788 --> 00:07:45,975
I'm Malia.

207
00:07:45,975 --> 00:07:48,556
- Malia, hey.

208
00:07:51,213 --> 00:07:52,796
- I'm 26 years old.

209
00:07:53,903 --> 00:07:55,320
I'm from Montana.

210
00:07:57,088 --> 00:07:59,671
I'm of Native American descent.

211
00:08:00,802 --> 00:08:03,135
My grandfather was a shaman,

212
00:08:04,472 --> 00:08:06,889
and ever since I was a child,

213
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,927
I've been able to see and
communicate with the dead.

214
00:08:12,841 --> 00:08:16,128
- Now is that
something that can be taught?

215
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:17,211
- Why?

216
00:08:17,211 --> 00:08:18,384
You wanna learn?

217
00:08:18,384 --> 00:08:20,296
- No, I was just wondering.

218
00:08:20,296 --> 00:08:21,599
That's all.

219
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:22,783
- Oh, okay.

220
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,598
- I've had out of body
experiences before myself.

221
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:26,651
- Really?

222
00:08:26,651 --> 00:08:28,849
- Yeah, I saw myself strangling Shelly,

223
00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:32,651
and then whoosh, back in my body.

224
00:08:32,651 --> 00:08:34,119
- Paige Stone, ladies and gentlemen.

225
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:37,441
Oh and don't you worry, she
will be with us all night.

226
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:39,901
- I did.

227
00:08:39,901 --> 00:08:40,734
Left a message.

228
00:08:40,734 --> 00:08:41,567
- Okay.

229
00:08:42,434 --> 00:08:43,267
Jackson.

230
00:08:43,267 --> 00:08:44,100
- Yeah?

231
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,935
- You're up.

232
00:08:45,935 --> 00:08:47,771
- You want me on film?

233
00:08:47,771 --> 00:08:48,604
- Yeah, we wanna get--
- Yeah, if you could,

234
00:08:48,604 --> 00:08:50,239
just a little.
- Everybody on.

235
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:51,317
Your background.

236
00:08:51,317 --> 00:08:53,207
- Something about yourself.

237
00:08:53,207 --> 00:08:54,040
- My name's Jackson.

238
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,071
I'm here to run sound.

239
00:08:55,071 --> 00:08:56,904
- Hi, Jackson.

240
00:08:58,176 --> 00:08:59,009
- Okay.

241
00:09:00,823 --> 00:09:02,447
I wasn't hugged much as a child,

242
00:09:02,447 --> 00:09:04,976
but I'm starting to feel
that this group therapy thing

243
00:09:04,976 --> 00:09:07,559
is really gonna help out a lot.

244
00:09:09,546 --> 00:09:12,412
- Could you just take
this a little more seriously?

245
00:09:12,412 --> 00:09:15,681
- Oh, you want me to be serious?

246
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:16,514
Oh, sorry.

247
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,872
My name's Jackson.

248
00:09:19,872 --> 00:09:20,872
I run sound.

249
00:09:21,816 --> 00:09:24,230
Was that serious for you?

250
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,021
I like studying and
researching the unknown,

251
00:09:26,021 --> 00:09:30,188
and I've even run sound
for a few satanic rituals.

252
00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:32,790
- Really?

253
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,623
Like what?

254
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,662
- Typical shit, people try
and talk to dead people,

255
00:09:37,662 --> 00:09:39,321
drinking goat's blood, skinning cats,

256
00:09:39,321 --> 00:09:41,741
drinking human blood.

257
00:09:41,741 --> 00:09:45,379
That Twilight stuff's
pretty popular right now.

258
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:47,962
- You watched people skin cats?

259
00:09:49,317 --> 00:09:50,484
- Haven't you?

260
00:09:51,565 --> 00:09:52,398
- No.

261
00:09:54,064 --> 00:09:57,365
- Note to self, never party with that guy.

262
00:09:57,365 --> 00:09:58,715
- All right, I
think next we should--

263
00:09:58,715 --> 00:10:01,382
- Elsa.
- Yeah.

264
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:04,134
- Hi.

265
00:10:04,134 --> 00:10:05,001
I'm Elsa.

266
00:10:05,001 --> 00:10:05,834
I'm 25.

267
00:10:07,887 --> 00:10:09,387
I am Jack's Velma.

268
00:10:11,738 --> 00:10:12,821
He's Freddie.

269
00:10:14,338 --> 00:10:16,742
It's from Scooby Doo.

270
00:10:16,742 --> 00:10:18,792
- That's cute.

271
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:19,625
- You are.

272
00:10:21,165 --> 00:10:23,498
I'm from Seattle originally,

273
00:10:25,144 --> 00:10:28,181
and we've been here for the
last two years running sound,

274
00:10:28,181 --> 00:10:31,264
and I'm just really happy to be here.

275
00:10:36,096 --> 00:10:36,929
That's it.

276
00:10:38,061 --> 00:10:39,100
- Good.

277
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,980
I guess that will be the
end of the background stuff.

278
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,328
I wonder if we're gonna be
shooting anything else tonight.

279
00:10:47,328 --> 00:10:49,697
- Can I talk to you for a minute?

280
00:10:49,697 --> 00:10:50,530
Not you.

281
00:10:52,281 --> 00:10:53,258
- What?

282
00:10:53,258 --> 00:10:54,294
- Don't do that.

283
00:10:54,294 --> 00:10:55,384
- Do what?

284
00:10:55,384 --> 00:10:57,300
- Talk to me like that.

285
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,312
I don't think you have any idea

286
00:10:58,312 --> 00:11:00,700
how hard this has been on me.

287
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,752
I've been lining up a
new crew in every city,

288
00:11:02,752 --> 00:11:04,236
finding all the stories, the locations,

289
00:11:04,236 --> 00:11:05,430
doing all the background research,

290
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:08,547
booking hotel and travel,
uploading the footage.

291
00:11:08,547 --> 00:11:12,446
I need a little help,
Shelly, a little bit of help.

292
00:11:12,446 --> 00:11:13,841
- Why didn't you just ask?

293
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:14,891
- Fucking amateurs.

294
00:11:14,891 --> 00:11:18,054
- I did ask you,
Shelly, and you blew me off.

295
00:11:18,054 --> 00:11:19,395
- Why don't you get a peek of this?

296
00:11:19,395 --> 00:11:20,593
- I can't keep this pace up.

297
00:11:20,593 --> 00:11:23,303
I'm 24 years old and I look like I'm 40.

298
00:11:23,303 --> 00:11:24,360
- You know that's bullshit.

299
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,222
You don't look 40.

300
00:11:25,222 --> 00:11:26,573
- Stop.

301
00:11:26,573 --> 00:11:29,608
- You look just as prepubescent as ever.

302
00:11:29,608 --> 00:11:30,724
- I'm serious.

303
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:31,743
- Okay, listen.

304
00:11:31,743 --> 00:11:32,576
- Come on.

305
00:11:32,576 --> 00:11:34,262
- We can deal with your workload

306
00:11:34,262 --> 00:11:37,111
and your emotional state later.

307
00:11:37,111 --> 00:11:39,076
If that caretaker doesn't get here soon,

308
00:11:39,076 --> 00:11:40,364
we're gonna lose the night.

309
00:11:40,364 --> 00:11:41,213
- I know.

310
00:11:41,213 --> 00:11:42,447
- You guys, what's the holdup?

311
00:11:42,447 --> 00:11:44,848
- We're just waiting
on the man with the keys.

312
00:11:44,848 --> 00:11:46,183
- Call him.

313
00:11:46,183 --> 00:11:47,518
- I'm calling him again right now.

314
00:11:47,518 --> 00:11:48,902
- Great.

315
00:11:48,902 --> 00:11:51,319
Shouldn't be too much longer.

316
00:11:54,487 --> 00:11:55,904
- Hi, is this AJ?

317
00:11:59,123 --> 00:12:01,290
You're in the black truck?

318
00:12:05,973 --> 00:12:06,806
Hello.

319
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:09,611
You're not AJ?

320
00:12:09,611 --> 00:12:10,827
- No, like I said, Doyle.

321
00:12:10,827 --> 00:12:11,844
AJ's my son.

322
00:12:11,844 --> 00:12:12,760
- It's nice to meet you, Doyle.

323
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,194
I'm Paige, the producer.

324
00:12:14,194 --> 00:12:15,980
This is Shelly Dewise, our director,

325
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,846
rest of the crew.

326
00:12:17,846 --> 00:12:19,314
- Nice to meet y'all.

327
00:12:19,314 --> 00:12:21,618
- It would've been nicer to
meet you about two hours ago,

328
00:12:21,618 --> 00:12:25,323
but I guess we'll just
take what we can get.

329
00:12:25,323 --> 00:12:26,878
- Aren't you a ray of sunshine?

330
00:12:26,878 --> 00:12:28,919
- You have no idea.

331
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:31,248
- You're here to let us in for your son?

332
00:12:31,248 --> 00:12:32,734
- Junior is

333
00:12:32,734 --> 00:12:34,033
home on his ass,

334
00:12:34,033 --> 00:12:35,535
recuperating from a
little discussion we had,

335
00:12:35,535 --> 00:12:38,162
so I thought I'd come down
and tell y'all what's what.

336
00:12:38,162 --> 00:12:39,412
- What is what?

337
00:12:41,485 --> 00:12:43,438
- It appears Junior decided

338
00:12:43,438 --> 00:12:44,838
he could make some money on the side

339
00:12:44,838 --> 00:12:46,087
dealing with y'all folks,

340
00:12:46,087 --> 00:12:48,201
but I'm in charge of this property,

341
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:51,335
and when I found about his
little business venture here,

342
00:12:51,335 --> 00:12:53,709
I thought I'd come down by myself.

343
00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:55,571
- Well, we're ready whenever you are.

344
00:12:55,571 --> 00:12:57,127
If you can let us in, that'd be great.

345
00:12:57,127 --> 00:12:57,960
- See,

346
00:12:59,523 --> 00:13:01,174
it's just,

347
00:13:01,174 --> 00:13:03,825
it's dangerous in there.

348
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:05,159
It's dangerous.

349
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:08,014
There's been a lot of
bad history in there.

350
00:13:08,014 --> 00:13:12,637
- Which is exactly why
we need to get in there.

351
00:13:12,637 --> 00:13:15,253
- Yes sir, that's why
we did the deal with you

352
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,086
several weeks ago.

353
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,606
- Hang on now, ma'am, you
didn't do a deal with me now.

354
00:13:18,606 --> 00:13:19,439
Okay?

355
00:13:19,439 --> 00:13:20,272
Let's be clear about that.

356
00:13:20,272 --> 00:13:22,303
You did a deal with my
bone-head son, okay?

357
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,602
- Listen, Doyle, is it?

358
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,222
- Yes.

359
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:27,638
- We're all
big boys and girls here.

360
00:13:27,638 --> 00:13:31,008
We can surely take care of ourselves.

361
00:13:31,008 --> 00:13:33,091
- Not in there you can't.

362
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:39,227
Sir, I'm responsible now
if I let y'all in there.

363
00:13:39,227 --> 00:13:42,074
I'm the one who's responsible.

364
00:13:42,074 --> 00:13:43,551
Is this camera on?

365
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,903
- Yeah, we're rolling.

366
00:13:44,903 --> 00:13:46,070
- Would you tell him to turn it off?

367
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,383
Can you turn that off, huh?

368
00:13:47,383 --> 00:13:49,097
I said turn it off goddammit!

369
00:13:49,097 --> 00:13:49,930
- Sorry, sir, sorry.

370
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:50,763
- Motherfucker!

371
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:51,596
- Sorry, sir.

372
00:13:51,596 --> 00:13:52,429
- Turn that motherfucker off!

373
00:13:52,429 --> 00:13:53,262
- It's off.

374
00:13:53,262 --> 00:13:54,095
It's off.

375
00:13:54,095 --> 00:13:56,087
- Stick it in your goddamn ass!

376
00:13:56,087 --> 00:13:57,170
- Look sir, I am--

377
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,216
- I don't like my picture taken!

378
00:13:59,216 --> 00:14:00,797
- It's off, it's off, sir.

379
00:14:00,797 --> 00:14:03,584
I really appreciate you
wanting to look out for us,

380
00:14:03,584 --> 00:14:06,401
but the thing is is that
your son signed a contract

381
00:14:06,401 --> 00:14:08,801
and already accepted payment.

382
00:14:08,801 --> 00:14:09,870
- Enough, enough.

383
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,401
Hey, look.

384
00:14:11,401 --> 00:14:14,404
This is our finale webisode,

385
00:14:14,404 --> 00:14:19,022
and we just really need
to get into that building.

386
00:14:19,022 --> 00:14:22,128
I'll do whatever it takes
to make that happen.

387
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:22,961
Whatever you want.

388
00:14:22,961 --> 00:14:24,680
Just what do you want?

389
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,609
- What do I want?

390
00:14:26,609 --> 00:14:27,442
Come on.

391
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,894
- Tell you what,

392
00:14:29,894 --> 00:14:34,280
I'll give you 50 bucks
more than I gave your kid.

393
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,863
- It's not about the
cash there, guy, okay?

394
00:14:38,984 --> 00:14:39,817
- Doyle!

395
00:14:39,817 --> 00:14:40,650
- Yep?

396
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:44,999
- How do you like your job?

397
00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:47,249
- What do you mean by that?

398
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,760
- I'm sure
your boss wouldn't like

399
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,322
the fact that your son is making money

400
00:14:51,322 --> 00:14:53,488
off of his property.

401
00:14:53,488 --> 00:14:57,079
I would be pretty upset about that,

402
00:14:57,079 --> 00:15:00,912
maybe even upset enough
to fire the caretaker.

403
00:15:03,216 --> 00:15:04,049
- Wow.

404
00:15:04,984 --> 00:15:07,968
Are you threatening me, city boy?

405
00:15:07,968 --> 00:15:11,080
If I were a betting man,
I'd say you threatened me.

406
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,048
- No, that's not a threat.

407
00:15:12,048 --> 00:15:12,881
- No?

408
00:15:12,881 --> 00:15:14,168
- No, I'm sure
you'd love

409
00:15:14,168 --> 00:15:17,700
an extra eight hours a
day at your trailer park.

410
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,534
- Oh, hey!

411
00:15:19,367 --> 00:15:20,200
Shell!

412
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,033
- Did you get that?

413
00:15:21,033 --> 00:15:21,866
Tell me you got that.

414
00:15:21,866 --> 00:15:22,699
- Oh I got it.

415
00:15:22,699 --> 00:15:25,591
- Okay, how about
you back up there, Doyle.

416
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,592
- How about you not talk shit to me.

417
00:15:27,592 --> 00:15:28,425
- Okay.

418
00:15:30,493 --> 00:15:32,799
I take it you've had a
few run-ins with the law,

419
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,534
haven't you?

420
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:37,550
I'd be willing to just keep
this between us if you just

421
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,383
let us in.

422
00:15:38,383 --> 00:15:39,550
- The law?

423
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,918
Fuck the law.

424
00:15:40,918 --> 00:15:41,751
Fuck it, you win.

425
00:15:41,751 --> 00:15:42,613
Let's go.

426
00:15:42,613 --> 00:15:43,446
- My kind of guy.

427
00:15:43,446 --> 00:15:44,590
Let's do this, guys.

428
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,136
- All right.

429
00:15:46,136 --> 00:15:47,267
Hope y'all got flashlights,

430
00:15:47,267 --> 00:15:49,135
'cause there's no power in there.

431
00:15:49,135 --> 00:15:50,085
- Jackson?

432
00:15:50,085 --> 00:15:51,502
- Yeah, I got that covered.

433
00:15:51,502 --> 00:15:54,525
- Nothing good's gonna
happen when I open this door,

434
00:15:54,525 --> 00:15:55,638
you hear me?

435
00:15:55,638 --> 00:15:57,421
When I open this door, ain't
nothing good gonna happen.

436
00:15:57,421 --> 00:15:58,254
- We got you.

437
00:15:58,254 --> 00:16:00,423
Just go ahead and leave the scary stories

438
00:16:00,423 --> 00:16:02,289
to the professionals.

439
00:16:02,289 --> 00:16:06,122
- When you leave, lock
the door, if you leave.

440
00:16:11,998 --> 00:16:12,831
What's your name?

441
00:16:12,831 --> 00:16:15,417
I'm just kidding.

442
00:16:15,417 --> 00:16:16,493
- Thank you so much for helping us.

443
00:16:16,493 --> 00:16:18,188
- Excuse me, ma'am,

444
00:16:18,188 --> 00:16:20,741
in all seriousness, I think
you're a very nice girl,

445
00:16:20,741 --> 00:16:22,673
now why don't you just
leave while you can?

446
00:16:22,673 --> 00:16:23,589
Just get out while you can.

447
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:25,123
- I really appreciate the concern, Doyle,

448
00:16:25,123 --> 00:16:27,077
but I think I'm gonna stay.

449
00:16:27,077 --> 00:16:29,859
Thank you so much for your help.

450
00:16:29,859 --> 00:16:31,227
Good night.

451
00:16:31,227 --> 00:16:34,560
- That guy wasn't creepy at all.

452
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,249
- Did you kiss
you boyfriend good night?

453
00:16:44,249 --> 00:16:46,416
- Shut up, Shelly.

454
00:16:50,569 --> 00:16:52,321
- Place has
got quite the ambiance.

455
00:16:52,321 --> 00:16:53,643
- I like it.

456
00:16:53,643 --> 00:16:55,310
It's dark and moody.

457
00:16:57,089 --> 00:16:58,658
- Like somebody else I know.

458
00:16:58,658 --> 00:17:01,297
- I think it's scary.

459
00:17:01,297 --> 00:17:05,010
- Are you sensing anything?

460
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:07,295
- I feel something.

461
00:17:07,295 --> 00:17:08,379
I'm not quite sure what it is,

462
00:17:08,379 --> 00:17:10,712
but it's not very welcoming.

463
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,382
- The Charles Manson
gang stayed here once.

464
00:17:14,382 --> 00:17:15,799
- Really?

465
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,753
- Yes, Louis, really,

466
00:17:19,753 --> 00:17:22,305
which you would know if you
read the packet that I gave you.

467
00:17:22,305 --> 00:17:23,638
- Right.

468
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:31,209
- Were ghosts really here?

469
00:17:31,209 --> 00:17:33,675
- That's what they say.

470
00:17:33,675 --> 00:17:34,649
- Hey Jackson.

471
00:17:34,649 --> 00:17:35,785
- Yeah?

472
00:17:35,785 --> 00:17:38,535
- Why don't you set up over here?

473
00:17:39,908 --> 00:17:41,708
How are you on batteries?

474
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:45,922
- We're good
for at least eight hours.

475
00:17:45,922 --> 00:17:46,891
Hey you guys, before I forget,

476
00:17:46,891 --> 00:17:47,974
please turn off your cellphones.

477
00:17:47,974 --> 00:17:52,195
My equipment is very
sensitive to interference.

478
00:17:52,195 --> 00:17:53,028
- Shelly.

479
00:17:53,028 --> 00:17:53,861
- Yeah?

480
00:17:53,861 --> 00:17:56,444
- We need to get you mic'ed up.

481
00:17:58,163 --> 00:17:59,163
- Be gentle.

482
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:03,619
- All right, all right,
guys, I'll mic up Shelly boy.

483
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:05,163
Elsa.

484
00:18:05,163 --> 00:18:07,555
You get the rest of the Scooby gang.

485
00:18:07,555 --> 00:18:10,787
And you keep your hands to yourself.

486
00:18:10,787 --> 00:18:12,187
- Don't worry.

487
00:18:12,187 --> 00:18:14,371
I don't touch the help.

488
00:18:14,371 --> 00:18:15,907
- Only your brother.

489
00:18:15,907 --> 00:18:17,074
- Hey.

490
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:23,643
- Are you about ready?

491
00:18:23,643 --> 00:18:24,476
- No.

492
00:18:25,724 --> 00:18:27,974
I need some time to set up.

493
00:18:29,941 --> 00:18:30,941
I wanna take a walk around

494
00:18:30,941 --> 00:18:33,108
and see if there's
somewhere where I find some

495
00:18:33,108 --> 00:18:34,275
better energy.

496
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:40,013
- Listen, I brought
three mini DV cameras.

497
00:18:40,013 --> 00:18:41,230
You want me to set those up?

498
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,653
- Abso-fucking-lutely.

499
00:18:42,653 --> 00:18:43,486
Paige?

500
00:18:43,486 --> 00:18:44,636
- Yeah?

501
00:18:44,636 --> 00:18:46,136
- See those notes,

502
00:18:48,802 --> 00:18:50,237
let's see, second floor,

503
00:18:50,237 --> 00:18:51,437
end of the hall.
- 207.

504
00:18:51,437 --> 00:18:52,371
- Room 207.

505
00:18:52,371 --> 00:18:55,226
- How about down this hall right here?

506
00:18:55,226 --> 00:18:56,162
- No.

507
00:18:56,162 --> 00:18:58,390
How about at the top of the staircase.

508
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:59,741
- Whatever you want.

509
00:18:59,741 --> 00:19:01,075
All right, it won't take me too long,

510
00:19:01,075 --> 00:19:04,849
just about 10 minutes and I'll be ready.

511
00:19:04,849 --> 00:19:06,396
- I'm not even gonna be on camera.

512
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:08,298
- Well you never know.

513
00:19:08,298 --> 00:19:09,895
- What do we do
while they're setting up

514
00:19:09,895 --> 00:19:13,213
and the sexy psychic's getting ready?

515
00:19:13,213 --> 00:19:14,699
- Paige?

516
00:19:14,699 --> 00:19:15,866
- Yes?

517
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:18,198
- Why don't you tell the audience

518
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:20,698
a little bit about this place?

519
00:19:21,817 --> 00:19:22,650
- What?

520
00:19:23,485 --> 00:19:25,425
I've never been on the show before.

521
00:19:25,425 --> 00:19:28,155
- Yes, well you just gave me an earful

522
00:19:28,155 --> 00:19:31,680
about how you're
overburdened with research.

523
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,102
Why don't you just tell us about it?

524
00:19:34,102 --> 00:19:35,435
- Paige.

525
00:19:37,289 --> 00:19:38,352
- Are you serious?

526
00:19:38,352 --> 00:19:39,353
You sure?

527
00:19:39,353 --> 00:19:40,473
- Yeah.

528
00:19:40,473 --> 00:19:42,897
We don't have anyone else here

529
00:19:42,897 --> 00:19:45,209
who's an expert on the
history of this place,

530
00:19:45,209 --> 00:19:46,209
so I'm sure.

531
00:19:48,676 --> 00:19:50,542
- Thanks for the vote of confidence.

532
00:19:50,542 --> 00:19:51,375
Geez.

533
00:19:52,223 --> 00:19:54,710
All right, I'm just gonna
look at my notes really quick.

534
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:55,543
- Okay.

535
00:19:55,543 --> 00:19:56,376
You got your notes,

536
00:19:56,376 --> 00:19:58,513
and all you have to do is relax.

537
00:19:58,513 --> 00:19:59,346
- Geez.

538
00:19:59,346 --> 00:20:00,179
- Breathe.

539
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:01,698
Louis, just follow us
down one of the halls,

540
00:20:01,698 --> 00:20:03,948
and you just walk and talk.

541
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,048
I do it all the time.

542
00:20:07,048 --> 00:20:07,901
You got a...

543
00:20:07,901 --> 00:20:08,734
- No!

544
00:20:08,734 --> 00:20:09,983
- Camera's rolling.

545
00:20:09,983 --> 00:20:11,688
- I'm gonna cue you in.

546
00:20:11,688 --> 00:20:12,521
You ready?

547
00:20:12,521 --> 00:20:13,354
- Okay.

548
00:20:14,466 --> 00:20:15,602
- Yeah, still rolling.

549
00:20:15,602 --> 00:20:17,217
- All right.

550
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:21,740
What can you tell me about
the history of this hotel?

551
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:24,738
- The Don Park Hotel was
originally built in 1850

552
00:20:24,738 --> 00:20:26,392
by a Miss Jane Zool.

553
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,092
She built the hotel on
Native American land

554
00:20:28,092 --> 00:20:29,541
for these Native Americans

555
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:31,709
that were displaced by the
greedy land barons of the time.

556
00:20:31,709 --> 00:20:34,345
- Cut.

557
00:20:34,345 --> 00:20:35,644
You're going way too fast.

558
00:20:35,644 --> 00:20:37,346
- You look good though.

559
00:20:37,346 --> 00:20:38,595
- Yeah.

560
00:20:38,595 --> 00:20:39,767
Yeah she does.

561
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,613
- I can slow down.

562
00:20:41,613 --> 00:20:42,446
- Slow down.

563
00:20:42,446 --> 00:20:43,279
Try to keep a good distance.

564
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:45,749
Don't move the camera too fast.

565
00:20:45,749 --> 00:20:47,666
I want it to be smooth.

566
00:20:48,636 --> 00:20:50,067
Just take it.

567
00:20:50,067 --> 00:20:51,734
I'll start you over.

568
00:20:52,652 --> 00:20:55,687
The first owner, how did she die?

569
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:59,495
- She died in
bed, of natural causes.

570
00:20:59,495 --> 00:21:00,802
- Then what?

571
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:03,885
- Then in 1846, the Mayor of the town

572
00:21:04,915 --> 00:21:06,130
took the land for himself

573
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:08,139
and turned it into a hotel.

574
00:21:08,139 --> 00:21:11,157
A year after that, he killed
his wife and his brother

575
00:21:11,157 --> 00:21:14,157
in a bloody, gruesome double murder.

576
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,378
He hung himself.

577
00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:20,795
He hung himself after that.

578
00:21:20,795 --> 00:21:21,628
- Oh.

579
00:21:21,628 --> 00:21:23,367
Interesting.

580
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:25,184
Where did that take place?

581
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:27,185
- That was all in room 207.

582
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:28,734
One incident that I read about

583
00:21:28,734 --> 00:21:30,534
said that he found them having an affair,

584
00:21:30,534 --> 00:21:33,103
but another incident
said he just went crazy.

585
00:21:38,384 --> 00:21:39,217
- Okay.

586
00:21:42,394 --> 00:21:43,227
Go on.

587
00:21:44,074 --> 00:21:46,241
- Then, from 1902 to 1922,

588
00:21:50,562 --> 00:21:54,450
this woman named Amanda
Wiley owned the hotel.

589
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:58,617
She used it to house loggers
when the mill opened up.

590
00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:02,875
She fell off the roof in
the middle of the night,

591
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:05,935
but her death was never fully explained.

592
00:22:05,935 --> 00:22:08,268
- What else can you tell us?

593
00:22:09,827 --> 00:22:12,188
- It sat vacant until 1945.

594
00:22:12,188 --> 00:22:14,023
That's when the state purchased it

595
00:22:14,023 --> 00:22:17,319
to house an overflow psychiatric...

596
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:18,652
- What was that?

597
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:21,912
Did you guys hear that?

598
00:22:21,912 --> 00:22:23,151
- Yes.

599
00:22:23,151 --> 00:22:25,994
- Sounded like someone coughing.

600
00:22:25,994 --> 00:22:29,074
- They purchased it to house
overflow psychiatric patients,

601
00:22:29,074 --> 00:22:30,865
and you're gonna love this part,

602
00:22:30,865 --> 00:22:32,475
one of the orderlies was discovered

603
00:22:32,475 --> 00:22:35,584
to be having sex with the
patients, murdering them,

604
00:22:35,584 --> 00:22:39,680
and then feeding their bodies to the rats.

605
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,430
- That's why I
never read the packet.

606
00:22:45,503 --> 00:22:46,940
- The orderly later said that

607
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,857
a demon made him do it.

608
00:22:49,765 --> 00:22:50,598
- Wow.

609
00:22:50,598 --> 00:22:51,455
- He was convicted.

610
00:22:51,455 --> 00:22:53,705
Executed by electric chair.

611
00:22:55,426 --> 00:22:57,472
- Who owns the hotel now?

612
00:22:57,472 --> 00:23:00,057
- It belongs to a family trust.

613
00:23:00,057 --> 00:23:02,179
Oddly enough, they've never
done anything with it.

614
00:23:02,179 --> 00:23:04,592
I think it's being sold.

615
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:08,929
- After sifting through all
the history about this place,

616
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,929
what might you conclude?

617
00:23:22,473 --> 00:23:23,306
Hello?

618
00:23:27,266 --> 00:23:28,599
Is anybody here?

619
00:23:36,946 --> 00:23:37,779
Okay.

620
00:23:40,624 --> 00:23:45,296
I think something is trying
to communicate with us.

621
00:23:45,296 --> 00:23:49,463
This would be the first
apparition caught on tape,

622
00:23:51,522 --> 00:23:52,355
tonight.

623
00:23:55,548 --> 00:23:56,381
Hello?

624
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,790
We're not here to harm you.

625
00:24:04,321 --> 00:24:08,488
Could you just give us a sign
that you're here with us?

626
00:24:19,243 --> 00:24:20,076
Oh shit.

627
00:24:21,195 --> 00:24:22,945
- Oh my gosh.

628
00:24:27,747 --> 00:24:30,247
- Let's give this another try.

629
00:24:48,848 --> 00:24:50,016
Not cool, man!

630
00:24:50,016 --> 00:24:51,092
Not cool!

631
00:24:51,092 --> 00:24:52,542
- You couldn't see me down there?

632
00:24:52,542 --> 00:24:54,010
- No!

633
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:55,077
- I'm sorry, I won't do it again.

634
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:57,113
- Yeah, that'd be good.

635
00:24:57,113 --> 00:24:58,722
- Listen, I've almost
got all the cameras set up,

636
00:24:58,722 --> 00:25:00,875
and then we'll be almost ready.

637
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:01,708
- Why don't you go ahead

638
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:02,541
and get finished with that?

639
00:25:02,541 --> 00:25:03,374
Thank you.

640
00:25:03,374 --> 00:25:06,939
- You could even
record flying balls.

641
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:10,740
- Paige, where do you
find these people, huh?

642
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,092
- He just heard you say that.

643
00:25:12,092 --> 00:25:13,009
- Whatever.

644
00:25:13,899 --> 00:25:15,159
Oh my god.

645
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:16,191
- I thought it was funny.

646
00:25:16,191 --> 00:25:17,417
- You would.

647
00:25:17,417 --> 00:25:20,094
- He's really qualified.

648
00:25:20,094 --> 00:25:20,927
- That's enough.

649
00:25:20,927 --> 00:25:21,760
- We paid 12 hours.

650
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,978
- Okay.

651
00:25:22,978 --> 00:25:24,145
Where were we?

652
00:25:25,974 --> 00:25:26,807
Okay.

653
00:25:33,757 --> 00:25:36,640
After sifting through all
the history about this place,

654
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,391
what would you conclude?

655
00:25:39,391 --> 00:25:41,511
- If you examine the evidence,

656
00:25:41,511 --> 00:25:43,144
all but the original owner

657
00:25:43,144 --> 00:25:47,311
met with tragic, and most
times very violent ends.

658
00:25:48,946 --> 00:25:49,779
- And?

659
00:25:50,838 --> 00:25:53,167
- There's something about this place

660
00:25:53,167 --> 00:25:57,334
that has the capacity to drive
people to extreme violence.

661
00:26:00,239 --> 00:26:01,322
And insanity.

662
00:26:02,488 --> 00:26:04,439
- And that's a wrap.

663
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:05,823
That was good.

664
00:26:05,823 --> 00:26:06,678
- Yeah?

665
00:26:06,678 --> 00:26:07,511
- Yeah, it's gonna be good.

666
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,608
- Are you okay?

667
00:26:13,608 --> 00:26:16,544
- Yeah, fine, just
let's make a rule that

668
00:26:16,544 --> 00:26:19,159
people warn me when they're
about to come into the room.

669
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:20,710
Thanks.

670
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:25,368
- Guys, this really,
really isn't a good idea.

671
00:26:25,368 --> 00:26:27,597
There's a really bad feeling in here

672
00:26:27,597 --> 00:26:29,745
and I don't think I can do it.

673
00:26:29,745 --> 00:26:31,800
- Yeah, we just heard all about it.

674
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,967
It's gruesome.

675
00:26:34,732 --> 00:26:35,565
What?

676
00:26:35,565 --> 00:26:36,398
- You don't believe, do you?

677
00:26:36,398 --> 00:26:38,736
- Believe?

678
00:26:38,736 --> 00:26:40,224
Yeah, no.

679
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:43,087
If God exists, may he strike me down.

680
00:26:43,087 --> 00:26:44,604
- Shell, don't go
there with the God thing.

681
00:26:44,604 --> 00:26:46,687
- Louis, there is no God.

682
00:26:48,511 --> 00:26:49,873
There are no ghosts.

683
00:26:49,873 --> 00:26:51,812
And everything is going to be fine.

684
00:26:51,812 --> 00:26:55,463
- Okay, well, I can't perform
the ceremony, not here.

685
00:26:55,463 --> 00:26:56,832
It's too dangerous.

686
00:26:56,832 --> 00:26:57,859
I can't do it.

687
00:26:57,859 --> 00:27:01,416
- Do you really believe
the shit you're selling?

688
00:27:01,416 --> 00:27:02,280
- Selling?

689
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,384
- Yeah.

690
00:27:04,384 --> 00:27:05,217
I'm sorry.

691
00:27:06,431 --> 00:27:07,399
Come here.

692
00:27:07,399 --> 00:27:08,232
Come here.

693
00:27:14,784 --> 00:27:16,679
I know why you need the money.

694
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:19,096
Paige told me about your mom.

695
00:27:20,552 --> 00:27:23,802
I am more than willing to give you 500.

696
00:27:28,472 --> 00:27:29,902
- No.

697
00:27:29,902 --> 00:27:30,752
- No?

698
00:27:30,752 --> 00:27:31,856
- I can't.

699
00:27:31,856 --> 00:27:33,189
- Okay.

700
00:27:35,421 --> 00:27:36,254
Let's see.

701
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:39,512
I've got one two three...

702
00:27:39,512 --> 00:27:43,157
I'm gonna be driving home on fumes here.

703
00:27:43,157 --> 00:27:44,490
I've got $1,000.

704
00:27:47,112 --> 00:27:50,195
It's all yours if you do this for me.

705
00:27:51,644 --> 00:27:52,644
I need this.

706
00:27:54,132 --> 00:27:55,720
Please.

707
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,553
Come on.

708
00:27:57,488 --> 00:27:58,321
Please.

709
00:27:59,367 --> 00:28:01,683
Everything's gonna be okay.

710
00:28:01,683 --> 00:28:02,683
It's a goof.

711
00:28:05,252 --> 00:28:06,419
- It's not a goof.

712
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:08,520
- 1,000 bucks.

713
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,270
- Okay, fine.

714
00:28:12,105 --> 00:28:14,441
I'm gonna need everyone in here,

715
00:28:14,441 --> 00:28:19,065
and when this is done, I'm
out, no questions asked.

716
00:28:19,065 --> 00:28:20,541
- No questions.

717
00:28:20,541 --> 00:28:22,043
I'll give this to you when we're done.

718
00:28:22,043 --> 00:28:23,760
Louis, round the troops up.

719
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,028
Let's pound this out.

720
00:28:25,028 --> 00:28:26,111
- On it, bro.

721
00:28:31,065 --> 00:28:33,025
See the rack on that Malia chick?

722
00:28:33,025 --> 00:28:35,024
We gotta get on that one.

723
00:28:35,024 --> 00:28:36,524
Hope she's single.

724
00:28:38,191 --> 00:28:39,960
Look, what are these guys doing?

725
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,005
- I think that you get your nose

726
00:28:43,005 --> 00:28:45,503
any further up that guy's ass,

727
00:28:45,503 --> 00:28:48,077
must be getting hard to breathe.

728
00:28:48,077 --> 00:28:49,706
- Gee, Jackson,

729
00:28:49,706 --> 00:28:52,998
does somebody feel a little bit envious?

730
00:28:52,998 --> 00:28:54,342
Unlike somebody I know,

731
00:28:54,342 --> 00:28:57,181
Shelly's actually doing
something with his talents.

732
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,193
- Talent?

733
00:29:01,414 --> 00:29:02,416
Talent?

734
00:29:02,416 --> 00:29:03,285
You mean his highly polished ability

735
00:29:03,285 --> 00:29:04,923
to know fuck all and keep his job?

736
00:29:04,923 --> 00:29:07,670
Oh, oh, they went out in the hole.

737
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:11,929
They brought to him a dumb
man possessed with a devil.

738
00:29:11,929 --> 00:29:14,827
- You know what you always say.

739
00:29:14,827 --> 00:29:17,898
Don't hate the player, hate the game.

740
00:29:17,898 --> 00:29:20,829
- I had a shirt
that said that once.

741
00:29:20,829 --> 00:29:21,912
- Hey, Louis.

742
00:29:23,114 --> 00:29:24,832
We're pretty much ready.

743
00:29:24,832 --> 00:29:25,665
- Are you sure?

744
00:29:25,665 --> 00:29:26,868
Because I can totally give you more time

745
00:29:26,868 --> 00:29:28,406
to rip on my brother.

746
00:29:28,406 --> 00:29:30,084
- No no no, don't listen to Jackson.

747
00:29:30,084 --> 00:29:32,417
He bitches about everything.

748
00:29:34,306 --> 00:29:35,139
- I'm sorry, man.

749
00:29:35,139 --> 00:29:37,137
I wasn't trying to rip on your brother.

750
00:29:37,137 --> 00:29:39,623
Elsa just likes to push my buttons.

751
00:29:39,623 --> 00:29:42,040
I didn't mean anything by it.

752
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:44,071
- It's cool, man.

753
00:29:44,071 --> 00:29:47,280
I have to live with the guy 24/7.

754
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,113
- Actually, you know what?

755
00:29:48,113 --> 00:29:49,750
In fact, check this shit out, man.

756
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:53,553
I brought an EMF, which is
an electronic voice meter,

757
00:29:53,553 --> 00:29:56,443
and a ghost meter basically on a K2.

758
00:29:56,443 --> 00:29:58,773
It measures electronic voice phenomenon.

759
00:29:58,773 --> 00:30:01,367
I know they're gonna need it for the show,

760
00:30:01,367 --> 00:30:03,352
so why don't you get this
to Paige later, okay?

761
00:30:03,352 --> 00:30:04,185
- Okay.

762
00:30:05,027 --> 00:30:07,110
- Most cool, man.

763
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,929
Where did you get that shit?

764
00:30:09,929 --> 00:30:12,483
- Told you, I've done a
lot of interesting jobs.

765
00:30:12,483 --> 00:30:13,916
- Oh yeah, about that,

766
00:30:13,916 --> 00:30:16,416
is that where you got that Bible quote?

767
00:30:16,416 --> 00:30:19,150
- What, are you surprised
I can quote scripture?

768
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,936
- Yeah, actually.

769
00:30:20,936 --> 00:30:22,889
Why don't you do another one?

770
00:30:22,889 --> 00:30:25,534
- Would it make you feel better?

771
00:30:25,534 --> 00:30:27,020
- Yeah, sort of.

772
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,469
- I'm with Louis.

773
00:30:28,469 --> 00:30:33,036
- How about, and the scribes
came down from Jerusalem,

774
00:30:33,036 --> 00:30:34,706
and they said, "He hath Beelzebub,"

775
00:30:34,706 --> 00:30:36,668
and by the prince of the devils,

776
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,413
he casteth out the devils,

777
00:30:38,413 --> 00:30:39,400
and the man fell on the ground,

778
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,567
wallowing, foaming at the mouth.

779
00:30:44,922 --> 00:30:46,222
Jesus, what'd he do?

780
00:30:46,222 --> 00:30:48,621
He rebuked the foul spirit.

781
00:30:48,621 --> 00:30:49,922
You know that one?

782
00:30:49,922 --> 00:30:51,441
- Nope.

783
00:30:53,588 --> 00:30:57,193
Satan, Lucifer, Devil,
those are all scary names,

784
00:30:57,193 --> 00:30:58,558
but Beezlebub.

785
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:00,575
- It's Beelzebub.

786
00:31:00,575 --> 00:31:02,209
- Okay, yeah yeah, Beelzebub.

787
00:31:02,209 --> 00:31:03,877
That one does nothing for me.

788
00:31:03,877 --> 00:31:07,810
It sounds like a redneck
clown or something.

789
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:09,685
- What's up, Louis?

790
00:31:09,685 --> 00:31:12,421
- Oh hey, it
looks like it's showtime.

791
00:31:12,421 --> 00:31:13,789
- All right.

792
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:15,379
Let's go.

793
00:31:15,379 --> 00:31:16,594
Hey, you coming?

794
00:31:16,594 --> 00:31:18,358
- No, you guys run
along and find Beelzebub.

795
00:31:18,358 --> 00:31:19,194
I've got work to do.

796
00:31:19,194 --> 00:31:20,459
- We're really gonna miss you.

797
00:31:20,459 --> 00:31:22,561
- I know, you will.

798
00:31:22,561 --> 00:31:24,811
- So long, Jackson.

799
00:31:28,373 --> 00:31:30,841
What's the deal with you and Jackson?

800
00:31:30,841 --> 00:31:31,674
- Why?

801
00:31:31,674 --> 00:31:33,081
Who's asking?

802
00:31:33,081 --> 00:31:34,581
- Just me.

803
00:31:36,109 --> 00:31:38,359
- It's a long story.

804
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,997
- Hey guys.

805
00:31:43,845 --> 00:31:44,997
Where's Jackson?

806
00:31:44,997 --> 00:31:46,817
- He's not coming.

807
00:31:46,817 --> 00:31:47,984
- And why not?

808
00:31:49,085 --> 00:31:50,382
- It's all right, it doesn't matter.

809
00:31:50,382 --> 00:31:52,833
We have enough people
to perform the ceremony.

810
00:31:52,833 --> 00:31:56,250
Honestly, this really doesn't feel right.

811
00:31:57,988 --> 00:31:59,572
It's not a game.

812
00:31:59,572 --> 00:32:01,255
Once we invite the spirits here,

813
00:32:01,255 --> 00:32:02,344
we can't control the outcome.

814
00:32:02,344 --> 00:32:03,572
Do you understand that?

815
00:32:03,572 --> 00:32:04,405
- Got it.

816
00:32:04,405 --> 00:32:05,928
I think we'll take our chances.

817
00:32:05,928 --> 00:32:07,678
Let's just get going.

818
00:32:13,066 --> 00:32:14,680
- All right.

819
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:18,531
Everyone, take a place
around in the circle.

820
00:32:18,531 --> 00:32:21,031
- Oh hold up, hold up.

821
00:32:27,835 --> 00:32:28,668
Okay.

822
00:32:31,854 --> 00:32:33,771
- Okay, everyone kneel.

823
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:44,628
This ritual is called the speak.

824
00:32:45,728 --> 00:32:48,993
It removes the veil
between the spirit world

825
00:32:48,993 --> 00:32:51,713
and our current reality.

826
00:32:51,713 --> 00:32:54,721
A sacred object needs
to be used to do this,

827
00:32:54,721 --> 00:32:57,314
so I'm using my grandmother's amulet.

828
00:32:57,314 --> 00:33:01,352
It'll serve as a portal
between the two realms.

829
00:33:01,352 --> 00:33:04,550
It'll allow the spirits
to pass into our realm.

830
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:08,717
We have to make sure that
none of us pass into theirs.

831
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:15,605
Are you guys sure you wanna do this?

832
00:33:15,605 --> 00:33:16,855
- Yes.

833
00:33:20,842 --> 00:33:21,675
- Okay.

834
00:33:23,188 --> 00:33:24,855
Everyone join hands.

835
00:33:34,586 --> 00:33:37,253
I am the speaker for this place.

836
00:33:38,121 --> 00:33:41,280
I come to make contact with the spirits,

837
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,863
to acknowledge you.

838
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,393
I light this candle

839
00:33:51,682 --> 00:33:55,033
in acknowledgement of your presence.

840
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,386
May its light reach
out across the barriers

841
00:33:57,386 --> 00:33:59,858
from this plane to the next,

842
00:33:59,858 --> 00:34:03,775
illuminating the passageway
between our worlds.

843
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:08,839
May the light from these
two candles blend and grow,

844
00:34:10,605 --> 00:34:13,858
dispelling all darkness
and lighting the way

845
00:34:13,858 --> 00:34:16,775
so that all spirits may come to us.

846
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:23,445
We are the speakers for this location.

847
00:34:23,445 --> 00:34:25,629
We welcome your presence.

848
00:34:25,629 --> 00:34:27,212
We grant you entry.

849
00:34:28,321 --> 00:34:29,571
Repeat with me.

850
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:33,136
- We are the
speakers for this location.

851
00:34:33,136 --> 00:34:34,905
We welcome your presence.

852
00:34:34,905 --> 00:34:36,717
We grant you entry.

853
00:34:36,717 --> 00:34:38,024
- Again.

854
00:34:38,024 --> 00:34:40,473
- We are the
speakers for this location.

855
00:34:40,473 --> 00:34:42,087
We welcome your presence.

856
00:34:42,087 --> 00:34:43,670
We grant you entry.

857
00:34:54,109 --> 00:34:55,478
- What the fuck was that?

858
00:34:55,478 --> 00:34:59,061
- That's some
bullshit right there.

859
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:02,180
- I told you.

860
00:35:07,391 --> 00:35:08,808
- Shelly.

861
00:35:10,469 --> 00:35:12,136
- Did you guys hear that?

862
00:35:12,136 --> 00:35:13,303
What was that?

863
00:35:16,294 --> 00:35:17,127
Dude!

864
00:35:17,127 --> 00:35:17,960
- What's all the screaming about?

865
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,191
- Something is
seriously wrong with you, man!

866
00:35:21,191 --> 00:35:22,024
- What?

867
00:35:27,205 --> 00:35:29,876
- How can we be sure that it worked?

868
00:35:29,876 --> 00:35:33,547
- For your sakes, I really hope it didn't.

869
00:35:33,547 --> 00:35:36,717
- It was a pleasure
doing business with you.

870
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:38,257
- Good luck.

871
00:35:38,257 --> 00:35:40,754
- Louis, see her to the door.

872
00:35:40,754 --> 00:35:44,171
- You don't have to ask me twice.

873
00:35:45,522 --> 00:35:48,309
- I hope you don't think I'm
a bad person for what I did.

874
00:35:48,309 --> 00:35:49,257
- What'd you do?

875
00:35:49,257 --> 00:35:51,526
You stood in the circle, said
some words, lit a candle.

876
00:35:51,526 --> 00:35:53,193
What's the big deal?

877
00:35:54,442 --> 00:35:56,127
- You really don't understand.

878
00:35:56,127 --> 00:35:58,434
What I did in there was real.

879
00:35:58,434 --> 00:35:59,831
If I didn't desperately need this money,

880
00:35:59,831 --> 00:36:02,664
I wouldn't even be here right now.

881
00:36:03,696 --> 00:36:05,466
- Yeah, you did
have me for a second

882
00:36:05,466 --> 00:36:07,549
when the lights went out.

883
00:36:08,602 --> 00:36:09,435
- Yeah.

884
00:36:11,083 --> 00:36:13,468
Well I guess this is goodbye.

885
00:36:13,468 --> 00:36:14,301
- Hey.

886
00:36:15,201 --> 00:36:17,137
When we get out of here,
can I give you a call?

887
00:36:17,137 --> 00:36:20,290
Maybe we can do dinner or something.

888
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:23,040
- Yeah.

889
00:36:28,241 --> 00:36:30,158
If you get out of here,

890
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,162
give me a call.

891
00:36:34,162 --> 00:36:35,896
- No no no, when.

892
00:36:35,896 --> 00:36:39,616
When we get out of here,
I'll give you a call.

893
00:36:39,616 --> 00:36:40,449
- Yeah.

894
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:43,967
Be careful.

895
00:36:48,305 --> 00:36:49,351
Holy shit!

896
00:36:49,351 --> 00:36:50,186
- What was that?

897
00:36:50,186 --> 00:36:51,986
Was that just the wind?

898
00:36:51,986 --> 00:36:53,625
- We're locked in!

899
00:36:53,625 --> 00:36:57,208
- What do you
mean we're locked in?

900
00:36:59,978 --> 00:37:01,145
What the hell?

901
00:37:01,979 --> 00:37:03,381
- Come on, we
gotta get back to the room.

902
00:37:03,381 --> 00:37:04,730
- Malia, what's going,

903
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:06,031
Malia, what's...

904
00:37:06,031 --> 00:37:07,948
What's going on, Malia?

905
00:37:10,416 --> 00:37:11,249
Wait up!

906
00:37:14,502 --> 00:37:16,402
- We're locked in!

907
00:37:16,402 --> 00:37:17,820
- The door locked by itself?

908
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,660
- Uh-huh.

909
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:21,356
- Guys, this is an old building.

910
00:37:21,356 --> 00:37:22,607
The door's probably just jammed.

911
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:23,940
- just jam.

912
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:24,977
I don't know what the hell just happened,

913
00:37:24,977 --> 00:37:27,325
but it did not just jam.

914
00:37:27,325 --> 00:37:28,325
- I warned you guys.

915
00:37:28,325 --> 00:37:30,277
The spirits are here.

916
00:37:30,277 --> 00:37:31,510
- That's great.

917
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:32,694
What are we waiting for?

918
00:37:32,694 --> 00:37:34,277
Let's check it out.

919
00:37:40,766 --> 00:37:41,599
- Wait, Malia, what's up?

920
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:42,948
Aren't you coming?

921
00:37:42,948 --> 00:37:44,333
- No, I'm staying here.

922
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:45,333
- Alone?

923
00:37:45,333 --> 00:37:46,784
Why?

924
00:37:46,784 --> 00:37:51,487
- Because I need to try to
save our lives, that's why!

925
00:37:51,487 --> 00:37:53,654
- Hey, be careful!

926
00:37:58,107 --> 00:37:58,940
Shelly?

927
00:37:58,940 --> 00:37:59,773
Shelly!

928
00:38:01,308 --> 00:38:02,613
- She's right, it's fucking locked.

929
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:05,030
- Try one of the other doors.

930
00:38:09,628 --> 00:38:10,461
Okay.

931
00:38:10,461 --> 00:38:11,617
Louis, here.

932
00:38:11,617 --> 00:38:13,367
- Yeah, yeah?

933
00:38:14,663 --> 00:38:16,212
- Shelly, really, right now?

934
00:38:16,212 --> 00:38:17,712
- Yeah, right now.

935
00:38:18,581 --> 00:38:19,999
- I don't know, man.

936
00:38:19,999 --> 00:38:21,082
- Right here.

937
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,942
My crew and I have mysteriously
been locked into the hotel

938
00:38:24,942 --> 00:38:27,556
after performing a Native American ritual

939
00:38:27,556 --> 00:38:29,921
known as the speak.

940
00:38:29,921 --> 00:38:34,405
Now let's see if we can
find some visual evidence

941
00:38:34,405 --> 00:38:37,061
of the spirit that's locked us in.

942
00:38:37,061 --> 00:38:38,380
- Shelly, I don't know, man--

943
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:40,009
- Louis, stop being a little bitch!

944
00:38:40,009 --> 00:38:42,164
It's probably just that psychopath Doyle

945
00:38:42,164 --> 00:38:43,943
fucking with our heads, okay?

946
00:38:43,943 --> 00:38:46,193
This is great for the show.

947
00:38:47,781 --> 00:38:51,531
- I'm gonna call Doyle,
see if I can get him.

948
00:38:52,446 --> 00:38:54,146
- Just try and get upstairs.

949
00:38:54,146 --> 00:38:54,979
Where's Malia?

950
00:38:54,979 --> 00:38:59,567
- She stayed in the
room we did the ritual in!

951
00:38:59,567 --> 00:39:00,567
- What's going on?

952
00:39:00,567 --> 00:39:01,400
- The door.

953
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,483
- Did you try the window?

954
00:39:04,586 --> 00:39:06,315
Why would there be bricks in here?

955
00:39:06,315 --> 00:39:09,648
Why would there be bricks in the window?

956
00:39:10,938 --> 00:39:13,021
Let's try the other room.

957
00:39:15,904 --> 00:39:16,737
Shelly.

958
00:39:17,807 --> 00:39:19,271
This wasn't here before.

959
00:39:19,271 --> 00:39:20,706
- That's impossible,

960
00:39:20,706 --> 00:39:22,375
unless one of you walked around

961
00:39:22,375 --> 00:39:23,826
and checked all the windows,

962
00:39:23,826 --> 00:39:25,326
nobody knows shit!

963
00:39:27,143 --> 00:39:28,393
- We did walk around the building,

964
00:39:28,393 --> 00:39:32,629
and there were no fucking
bricks on the windows.

965
00:39:32,629 --> 00:39:34,520
- Shelly, something is not right here.

966
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,603
We need to get out of here right now.

967
00:39:38,597 --> 00:39:40,551
- What the hell?

968
00:39:40,551 --> 00:39:42,400
- Hey, I wanna go.

969
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,703
Let's leave.

970
00:39:43,703 --> 00:39:44,655
- Hey.

971
00:39:44,655 --> 00:39:46,207
Come on, people.

972
00:39:46,207 --> 00:39:50,287
We're finally getting some
really good footage here.

973
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:52,224
What, we're gonna just pack up and leave,

974
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:54,172
because the door's locked?

975
00:39:54,172 --> 00:39:57,005
Seriously, this is why we're here!

976
00:39:58,807 --> 00:40:02,307
Unless someone's dying, we're not leaving.

977
00:40:03,176 --> 00:40:04,843
It's why we're here.

978
00:40:06,152 --> 00:40:09,735
Now what room did that
guy hang himself in?

979
00:40:13,432 --> 00:40:16,182
All right, let's go check it out.

980
00:40:17,282 --> 00:40:18,115
What?

981
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:27,710
- All right, Elsa, let's get back to work.

982
00:41:13,412 --> 00:41:16,329
- Damn, what's that smell?

983
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:22,993
Paige?

984
00:41:22,993 --> 00:41:23,826
- Yeah?

985
00:41:23,826 --> 00:41:25,443
- I need you to check the room numbers.

986
00:41:25,443 --> 00:41:26,554
- Yeah, right.

987
00:41:26,554 --> 00:41:27,387
217.

988
00:41:28,427 --> 00:41:29,260
218.

989
00:41:31,027 --> 00:41:31,860
It has to be down this way.

990
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,527
Shh shh shh shh shh!

991
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,928
Did you guys hear that?

992
00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:37,928
- Hear what?

993
00:41:44,153 --> 00:41:47,153
I think it's coming from over there.

994
00:42:42,515 --> 00:42:44,098
Like a bird's nest.

995
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,538
Where are they?

996
00:42:46,538 --> 00:42:47,371
- I don't know.

997
00:42:47,371 --> 00:42:49,609
There's no hole in the ceiling.

998
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:52,526
- What's going on, you guys?

999
00:42:55,613 --> 00:42:57,185
- Louis.

1000
00:42:57,185 --> 00:42:58,935
Louis, let's roll in.

1001
00:43:04,859 --> 00:43:06,838
We're in room 207,

1002
00:43:06,838 --> 00:43:10,866
site of a gruesome double murder suicide,

1003
00:43:10,866 --> 00:43:15,033
where it appears crows have
been nesting for years,

1004
00:43:16,027 --> 00:43:17,579
yet there's no visible evidence

1005
00:43:17,579 --> 00:43:19,746
of an entrance or an exit.

1006
00:43:23,495 --> 00:43:27,662
In many cultures, crows or
ravens are considered to be

1007
00:43:28,534 --> 00:43:30,534
the scavengers of death.

1008
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:35,404
The Don Park Hotel continues to unveil

1009
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:37,821
the mysteries of the unknown.

1010
00:43:57,626 --> 00:43:59,959
Let's get out of here, guys!

1011
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:03,874
- Shelly, get over here.

1012
00:44:03,874 --> 00:44:05,378
Get over here!

1013
00:44:05,378 --> 00:44:06,595
Okay, quick!

1014
00:44:06,595 --> 00:44:07,428
- All right.

1015
00:44:07,428 --> 00:44:09,002
- We need to find a fire escape.

1016
00:44:09,002 --> 00:44:10,397
- No we need to find Malia.

1017
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:11,723
- We need to go upstairs.

1018
00:44:14,979 --> 00:44:16,323
- Open the door!

1019
00:44:16,323 --> 00:44:17,158
Open the door!

1020
00:44:17,158 --> 00:44:17,991
No!

1021
00:44:17,991 --> 00:44:18,824
No no no no no!

1022
00:44:18,824 --> 00:44:20,497
I've gotta find Malia!

1023
00:44:20,497 --> 00:44:22,207
Louis, come with me!

1024
00:44:26,703 --> 00:44:28,185
Jackson!

1025
00:44:28,185 --> 00:44:29,435
Jackson, Louis!

1026
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:32,183
Louis!

1027
00:44:32,183 --> 00:44:33,078
Jackson!

1028
00:44:43,164 --> 00:44:44,280
Oh my god!

1029
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,754
Oh my god, Jackson!

1030
00:44:45,754 --> 00:44:46,602
Breathe.

1031
00:44:46,602 --> 00:44:48,019
Breathe, breathe.

1032
00:44:49,301 --> 00:44:50,270
- Jackson, you all right?

1033
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:51,486
- Oh my god, breathe.

1034
00:44:51,486 --> 00:44:53,054
Oh my god, Jackson.

1035
00:44:53,054 --> 00:44:53,918
Are you okay?

1036
00:44:53,918 --> 00:44:55,843
- Let's get
the fuck out of here.

1037
00:44:55,843 --> 00:44:56,676
Fuck!

1038
00:45:02,114 --> 00:45:05,947
- I didn't think
this place had power!

1039
00:45:06,962 --> 00:45:08,114
Oh shit, dude, you scared me.

1040
00:45:08,114 --> 00:45:08,947
- What happened?

1041
00:45:08,947 --> 00:45:11,350
- Scared the shit out of me.

1042
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:12,401
- What happened?

1043
00:45:12,401 --> 00:45:13,234
- We gotta get out of here.

1044
00:45:13,234 --> 00:45:15,369
This is crazy shit, man.

1045
00:45:15,369 --> 00:45:17,490
Something just tried to strangle Jackson!

1046
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:18,323
- What?

1047
00:45:18,323 --> 00:45:19,156
Was the camera rolling?

1048
00:45:19,156 --> 00:45:20,492
- Of course
the camera was rolling,

1049
00:45:20,492 --> 00:45:21,794
but fuck the camera, bro!

1050
00:45:21,794 --> 00:45:23,289
We need to get the fuck out of here!

1051
00:45:23,289 --> 00:45:24,263
- No, no, pick it up.

1052
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:25,096
- What happened?

1053
00:45:25,096 --> 00:45:25,929
- What?

1054
00:45:25,929 --> 00:45:27,508
- On your solar, rolling now!

1055
00:45:27,508 --> 00:45:28,659
Everything that happens from here on out

1056
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:30,242
I want on tape, okay?

1057
00:45:30,242 --> 00:45:31,426
- Something tried to kill Jackson!

1058
00:45:31,426 --> 00:45:32,977
- What happened?

1059
00:45:32,977 --> 00:45:34,227
- I don't know.

1060
00:45:37,797 --> 00:45:41,399
I was trying to fix the
interference with the lofts

1061
00:45:41,399 --> 00:45:43,138
and I was fucking ripped off of my feet,

1062
00:45:43,138 --> 00:45:44,675
something fucking grabbed my throat,

1063
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:47,175
I was pulled down the hallway.

1064
00:45:49,225 --> 00:45:51,808
It wasn't fucking Doyle either.

1065
00:45:52,726 --> 00:45:54,968
- You guys said
you heard crows, right?

1066
00:45:54,968 --> 00:45:57,696
- Yeah, in room 207.

1067
00:45:57,696 --> 00:46:01,779
- What do crows
have to do with anything?

1068
00:46:03,623 --> 00:46:04,941
- When crows cry together,

1069
00:46:04,941 --> 00:46:06,457
it's to confuse the evil entities

1070
00:46:06,457 --> 00:46:09,093
that wait for the soul to leave the body.

1071
00:46:09,093 --> 00:46:11,949
They were preparing for Jackson's death.

1072
00:46:11,949 --> 00:46:15,032
- What are you talking about?

1073
00:46:16,246 --> 00:46:17,932
- We opened a sliver,

1074
00:46:17,932 --> 00:46:20,600
a crack into the spirit world,

1075
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:24,070
but what came through is
darker and more powerful

1076
00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:26,239
than I could've imagined.

1077
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:27,875
It's gonna continue to expand,

1078
00:46:27,875 --> 00:46:30,833
letting any demon or spirit cross over.

1079
00:46:30,833 --> 00:46:33,583
- Cross over and do what?

1080
00:46:36,348 --> 00:46:40,688
- They're gonna start
taking us, one by one.

1081
00:46:40,688 --> 00:46:41,921
- Well then you need to stop it.

1082
00:46:41,921 --> 00:46:44,084
You need to turn it off.

1083
00:46:44,084 --> 00:46:45,285
- I've been trying,

1084
00:46:45,285 --> 00:46:46,718
but based on what's happened to Jackson,

1085
00:46:46,718 --> 00:46:47,885
it's too late!

1086
00:46:49,286 --> 00:46:50,753
The door can be closed,

1087
00:46:50,753 --> 00:46:54,148
but only at the first light of day.

1088
00:46:54,148 --> 00:46:56,264
- We're just gonna wait this thing out,

1089
00:46:56,264 --> 00:46:57,817
and when the sun comes up,

1090
00:46:57,817 --> 00:47:00,839
we're all gonna leave together.

1091
00:47:00,839 --> 00:47:03,776
- If any of us make it to see the sunrise.

1092
00:47:03,776 --> 00:47:06,055
- You are fucking insane!

1093
00:47:06,055 --> 00:47:06,990
- I'm insane?

1094
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:07,823
- Yeah!

1095
00:47:07,823 --> 00:47:10,759
- Everything I've told
you guys has happened!

1096
00:47:10,759 --> 00:47:12,826
The only way that we can save ourselves

1097
00:47:12,826 --> 00:47:14,943
is by taking the amulet
from the circle at dawn

1098
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:16,974
and bringing it into the daylight,

1099
00:47:16,974 --> 00:47:18,058
shutting the portal.

1100
00:47:18,058 --> 00:47:19,711
- Somebody fucking help me over here!

1101
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:20,544
What's wrong?

1102
00:47:20,544 --> 00:47:21,993
- Guys, Elsa.

1103
00:47:21,993 --> 00:47:23,344
- Breathe, breathe, Elsa.

1104
00:47:23,344 --> 00:47:24,666
Ellie, breathe.

1105
00:47:24,666 --> 00:47:25,677
What's wrong?

1106
00:47:25,677 --> 00:47:26,510
Lay down lay down lay down.

1107
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:27,343
- Paige!

1108
00:47:27,343 --> 00:47:28,176
- You're gonna be okay.

1109
00:47:28,176 --> 00:47:29,009
Lay down.

1110
00:47:29,009 --> 00:47:29,842
Lay down.

1111
00:47:29,842 --> 00:47:30,675
Everything will be okay.

1112
00:47:30,675 --> 00:47:32,780
- Do not take this woman!

1113
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:34,534
Leave here in our realm!

1114
00:47:34,534 --> 00:47:35,547
- Breathe, Elsa!

1115
00:47:35,547 --> 00:47:36,873
Breathe, Elsa!

1116
00:47:36,873 --> 00:47:38,388
- Oh my god!

1117
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:40,445
- I am the speaker for this place!

1118
00:47:40,445 --> 00:47:41,588
Do not take this woman!

1119
00:47:41,588 --> 00:47:43,975
Leave her in our realm!

1120
00:47:43,975 --> 00:47:44,808
- Breathe!

1121
00:47:44,808 --> 00:47:45,641
Breathe!

1122
00:47:45,641 --> 00:47:46,474
Breathe!

1123
00:47:53,162 --> 00:47:54,079
She's dead.

1124
00:48:00,615 --> 00:48:02,198
She's fucking dead.

1125
00:48:04,806 --> 00:48:05,682
You did this.

1126
00:48:05,682 --> 00:48:06,877
You fucking did this!

1127
00:48:06,877 --> 00:48:08,725
If it wasn't for you and
your fucking goddamn show,

1128
00:48:08,725 --> 00:48:10,109
she'd be fucking alive!

1129
00:48:10,109 --> 00:48:12,757
You're gonna die, you motherfucker!

1130
00:48:12,757 --> 00:48:13,792
- Stop it!

1131
00:48:13,792 --> 00:48:15,192
Stop it!

1132
00:48:15,192 --> 00:48:17,295
You wanna blame someone, blame me!

1133
00:48:17,295 --> 00:48:18,863
I knew the consequences
of what I was doing

1134
00:48:18,863 --> 00:48:20,280
and I did it anyway!

1135
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,590
She's dead because of me!

1136
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:24,180
- Guys, you guys, she's not dead.

1137
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:25,706
- What the fuck
are you talking about?

1138
00:48:25,706 --> 00:48:27,110
- She's not.

1139
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:28,360
She's not dead.

1140
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:32,423
Her breathing is really
faint, but she's breathing.

1141
00:48:32,423 --> 00:48:33,256
- Can you hear me?

1142
00:48:33,256 --> 00:48:34,089
- She's trying to say something.

1143
00:48:34,089 --> 00:48:36,589
I can't understand what it is.

1144
00:48:39,424 --> 00:48:40,277
- What's she saying?

1145
00:48:40,277 --> 00:48:42,110
- It's Ottawa.

1146
00:48:57,088 --> 00:48:57,921
- What?

1147
00:48:57,921 --> 00:48:59,534
What?

1148
00:48:59,534 --> 00:49:00,451
What is it?

1149
00:49:05,298 --> 00:49:07,080
- The bringer of death.

1150
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:10,403
The bringer is a demon
that takes different forms

1151
00:49:10,403 --> 00:49:12,866
and it enters the body

1152
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:15,970
and it makes people do terrible things.

1153
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:17,303
It's impossible.

1154
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:20,987
- No, that's...

1155
00:49:20,987 --> 00:49:21,937
No way.

1156
00:49:21,937 --> 00:49:22,956
- Paige?

1157
00:49:22,956 --> 00:49:23,789
- Yeah?

1158
00:49:23,789 --> 00:49:26,456
- What are our options?

1159
00:49:29,177 --> 00:49:30,796
- I think we should go up.

1160
00:49:30,796 --> 00:49:33,629
I think we need to go to the roof.

1161
00:49:36,149 --> 00:49:38,566
- Let's go to the roof, guys.

1162
00:49:42,101 --> 00:49:44,171
- We can't leave Elsa.

1163
00:49:44,171 --> 00:49:45,004
- No.

1164
00:49:46,339 --> 00:49:47,172
No.

1165
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:49,555
She has to stay here.

1166
00:49:49,555 --> 00:49:51,175
- I'm not leaving her.

1167
00:49:51,175 --> 00:49:52,755
- There's no telling
what she's capable of!

1168
00:49:52,755 --> 00:49:54,088
She can't leave!

1169
00:49:56,258 --> 00:49:57,758
- Be serious, Jackson, come on.

1170
00:49:57,758 --> 00:50:00,299
- Fuck you, Shelly!

1171
00:50:00,299 --> 00:50:03,644
- Do you wanna stay here and die?

1172
00:50:03,644 --> 00:50:06,763
- I'm not fucking leaving her.

1173
00:50:06,763 --> 00:50:08,680
- Well we are.

1174
00:50:17,127 --> 00:50:19,460
- Hey, Jackson, man.

1175
00:50:21,166 --> 00:50:21,999
- Don't worry about me.

1176
00:50:21,999 --> 00:50:23,556
Get the fuck out of here, man!

1177
00:50:23,556 --> 00:50:24,389
- Louis, come on.

1178
00:50:24,389 --> 00:50:25,689
- Be careful, Jackson.

1179
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,060
- Don't worry about me.

1180
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:27,990
Fuck you, man.

1181
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:28,823
- Louis!

1182
00:50:28,823 --> 00:50:31,740
- Yeah, Shelly, I'm coming!

1183
00:50:43,285 --> 00:50:46,285
- I just hope they're gonna be okay.

1184
00:50:48,665 --> 00:50:52,832
- There's not much
we can do for them now.

1185
00:50:59,332 --> 00:51:00,719
- Do you have some
sort of insight in the divine,

1186
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:04,636
because I could really
use some help right now.

1187
00:51:06,049 --> 00:51:07,471
- No.

1188
00:51:07,471 --> 00:51:09,633
But if you're asking what
I think we should do,

1189
00:51:09,633 --> 00:51:11,633
I think you should pray.

1190
00:51:20,306 --> 00:51:23,056
- Let's go back this way.

1191
00:51:32,143 --> 00:51:33,841
- What was that?

1192
00:51:33,841 --> 00:51:37,174
- Sounded like it was somebody knocking.

1193
00:51:38,744 --> 00:51:40,661
Does it mean something?

1194
00:51:43,631 --> 00:51:47,048
- They say that right after someone dies,

1195
00:51:47,996 --> 00:51:50,081
and you hear a knock in your house,

1196
00:51:50,081 --> 00:51:54,672
it's them telling you they're
all right from the other side.

1197
00:51:54,672 --> 00:51:56,784
- I remember when my dad died.

1198
00:51:56,784 --> 00:52:00,034
We used to hear knocks in my apartment.

1199
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:06,687
- What happens when it's not
all right on the other side?

1200
00:52:07,926 --> 00:52:09,509
- They knock twice.

1201
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,200
- That can be confusing.

1202
00:52:14,728 --> 00:52:16,723
- Wasn't there two knocks?

1203
00:52:17,556 --> 00:52:18,389
Elsa!

1204
00:52:22,274 --> 00:52:23,107
Elsa!

1205
00:52:24,241 --> 00:52:25,074
Elsa!

1206
00:52:26,427 --> 00:52:27,595
Elsa!

1207
00:52:27,595 --> 00:52:28,546
Elsa!

1208
00:52:28,546 --> 00:52:30,161
Shelly, get over here!

1209
00:52:30,161 --> 00:52:31,195
Elsa!

1210
00:52:31,195 --> 00:52:33,331
Shelly, help me with her!

1211
00:52:33,331 --> 00:52:34,164
Elsa!

1212
00:52:37,015 --> 00:52:37,946
- Where's Jackson?

1213
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:38,779
- We gotta find Jackson.

1214
00:52:38,779 --> 00:52:40,363
Jackson!

1215
00:52:40,363 --> 00:52:41,735
- Jackson!

1216
00:52:41,735 --> 00:52:42,654
- Let's go, let's
go, we gotta go upstairs.

1217
00:52:42,654 --> 00:52:43,585
- Jackson!

1218
00:52:43,585 --> 00:52:44,418
- Come on, Louis!

1219
00:52:44,418 --> 00:52:45,251
- He's not here!

1220
00:52:45,251 --> 00:52:46,084
Jackson's not here!

1221
00:52:46,084 --> 00:52:47,584
- Come on!

1222
00:52:58,579 --> 00:52:59,436
- You okay, Malia?

1223
00:52:59,436 --> 00:53:00,269
You okay?

1224
00:53:05,684 --> 00:53:06,517
You happy, bro?

1225
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:07,837
It looks like you got your show.

1226
00:53:07,837 --> 00:53:09,171
- You think I wanted this to happen?

1227
00:53:09,171 --> 00:53:10,004
- Man, I think you'd do anything

1228
00:53:10,004 --> 00:53:10,837
if it would get us some--

1229
00:53:10,837 --> 00:53:11,927
- Fighting is not gonna help us right now!

1230
00:53:11,927 --> 00:53:12,760
- Malia's right.

1231
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:13,593
We have to get through that door.

1232
00:53:13,593 --> 00:53:14,426
Come on.

1233
00:53:14,426 --> 00:53:15,259
Just kick it!

1234
00:53:15,259 --> 00:53:16,092
Kick it in!

1235
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:18,167
- I don't understand!

1236
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:36,784
- Shell, Shell, you okay, man?

1237
00:53:36,784 --> 00:53:37,887
- Yeah.

1238
00:53:37,887 --> 00:53:39,720
Louis, you were right.

1239
00:53:42,134 --> 00:53:44,339
Put the camera down.

1240
00:53:44,339 --> 00:53:45,756
We don't need it.

1241
00:53:46,659 --> 00:53:48,058
- No, Louis, pick it up.

1242
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:48,891
- What?

1243
00:53:48,891 --> 00:53:49,724
- Pick up that camera.

1244
00:53:49,724 --> 00:53:50,557
That footage is the only thing that proves

1245
00:53:50,557 --> 00:53:52,298
that we didn't kill Elsa!

1246
00:53:52,298 --> 00:53:55,221
Come on, hurry up, we gotta keep moving!

1247
00:53:55,221 --> 00:53:57,398
- Shell, Shell, do you wanna come?

1248
00:53:57,398 --> 00:53:59,263
- No, I need to sit down.

1249
00:53:59,263 --> 00:54:00,534
- Okay man,
stay there, stay there,

1250
00:54:00,534 --> 00:54:02,933
we'll be right back.

1251
00:54:02,933 --> 00:54:04,016
Paige, Malia!

1252
00:54:06,837 --> 00:54:09,274
- I remember reading about this.

1253
00:54:09,274 --> 00:54:12,191
This floor used to be an orphanage.

1254
00:54:14,644 --> 00:54:18,007
- The hotel's manifesting past wrongs.

1255
00:54:18,007 --> 00:54:19,583
- For what?

1256
00:54:19,583 --> 00:54:20,750
- Retribution.

1257
00:54:22,531 --> 00:54:24,114
Someone has to pay.

1258
00:54:25,465 --> 00:54:28,298
- By someone, you mean us.

1259
00:54:31,161 --> 00:54:31,994
- Shh.

1260
00:54:34,823 --> 00:54:36,740
Did you guys hear that?

1261
00:54:41,732 --> 00:54:45,482
- Come on, it's
just fucking with us.

1262
00:54:47,817 --> 00:54:48,984
It's not real.

1263
00:55:00,003 --> 00:55:01,242
Oh shit!

1264
00:55:01,242 --> 00:55:02,274
- Jackson, man!

1265
00:55:02,274 --> 00:55:03,189
We thought you were dead!

1266
00:55:03,189 --> 00:55:04,022
- What happened to Elsa?

1267
00:55:04,022 --> 00:55:08,362
We thought you were
supposed to stay with her!

1268
00:55:08,362 --> 00:55:10,307
- Elsa's fine.

1269
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:11,994
- Dude, what are
you talking about, man?

1270
00:55:11,994 --> 00:55:12,843
We're fighting for our lives here.

1271
00:55:12,843 --> 00:55:14,666
Elsa's dead.

1272
00:55:21,265 --> 00:55:22,598
- They're here.

1273
00:55:22,598 --> 00:55:23,850
- Jackson?

1274
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:25,034
Jackson, what's wrong with you?

1275
00:55:25,034 --> 00:55:25,982
You're gonna come with us, okay?

1276
00:55:25,982 --> 00:55:27,435
We're gonna find a way out of here.

1277
00:55:27,435 --> 00:55:28,533
- No, Paige, I
don't think he's okay.

1278
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:30,792
- Help me with him!

1279
00:55:30,792 --> 00:55:31,625
- Jackson!

1280
00:55:31,625 --> 00:55:32,458
Jackson!

1281
00:55:34,112 --> 00:55:35,295
Paige, we gotta get out of here!

1282
00:55:35,295 --> 00:55:36,128
- Find the fire escape,

1283
00:55:36,128 --> 00:55:36,961
and we're gonna get Shelly,

1284
00:55:36,961 --> 00:55:38,529
okay, come on, hurry up!

1285
00:55:38,529 --> 00:55:39,799
Louis, you go in there,
we're gonna go in here.

1286
00:55:39,799 --> 00:55:41,466
We're gonna go here.

1287
00:55:42,653 --> 00:55:44,986
- I told you not to film me!

1288
00:55:48,274 --> 00:55:49,778
- Jackson!

1289
00:55:49,778 --> 00:55:50,611
Hey!

1290
00:55:50,611 --> 00:55:51,444
Malia?

1291
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:54,477
Guys, guys!

1292
00:57:40,842 --> 00:57:41,675
Shelly!

1293
00:57:44,990 --> 00:57:45,823
Guys!

1294
00:58:17,001 --> 00:58:18,443
Shelly!

1295
00:58:18,443 --> 00:58:19,768
Shelly!

1296
00:58:19,768 --> 00:58:21,070
Shelly!

1297
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:21,903
Shelly!

1298
00:58:26,944 --> 00:58:27,777
Shell!

1299
00:58:27,777 --> 00:58:28,782
Shell!

1300
00:58:28,782 --> 00:58:29,735
Guys!

1301
00:58:29,735 --> 00:58:30,568
Guys!

1302
00:58:31,854 --> 00:58:33,934
Where'd you guys go?

1303
00:58:33,934 --> 00:58:35,451
- I don't know what the
hell you're talking about.

1304
00:58:35,451 --> 00:58:37,022
- I just searched this
entire floor for everyone.

1305
00:58:37,022 --> 00:58:37,951
You guys were all gone.

1306
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:39,185
Shelly's not even here.

1307
00:58:39,185 --> 00:58:40,637
- Are you okay?

1308
00:58:40,637 --> 00:58:42,638
- No, no, I'm not okay.

1309
00:58:42,638 --> 00:58:43,756
- All right, come on, let's find Shelly.

1310
00:58:43,756 --> 00:58:44,589
Come on.

1311
00:58:50,925 --> 00:58:52,708
- Wait, Shelly, that's impossible.

1312
00:58:52,708 --> 00:58:53,926
Where'd you go?

1313
00:58:53,926 --> 00:58:54,775
I was just right here.

1314
00:58:54,775 --> 00:58:56,194
- I haven't moved.

1315
00:58:56,194 --> 00:58:58,378
- What are you talking about?

1316
00:58:58,378 --> 00:58:59,812
- What'd you find?

1317
00:58:59,812 --> 00:59:01,412
- We found Jackson.

1318
00:59:01,412 --> 00:59:02,448
He's alive.

1319
00:59:02,448 --> 00:59:04,931
- Yeah, he's alive,
but he's definitely not well.

1320
00:59:04,931 --> 00:59:06,031
- He's really messed up, Shelly.

1321
00:59:06,031 --> 00:59:07,281
He disappeared.

1322
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:09,867
- We have to be careful.

1323
00:59:09,867 --> 00:59:12,901
If they've taken him, they're
gonna come for us next.

1324
00:59:12,901 --> 00:59:14,901
- Guys, guys, come here.

1325
00:59:19,856 --> 00:59:21,144
- Not that again.

1326
00:59:21,144 --> 00:59:24,644
- Oh, oh, it's making me so sick.

1327
00:59:33,697 --> 00:59:35,582
- I don't smell anything.

1328
00:59:35,582 --> 00:59:38,665
- How do you not smell that?

1329
00:59:40,204 --> 00:59:42,204
- They're coming for me.

1330
00:59:46,959 --> 00:59:48,792
I've shamed my family.

1331
00:59:51,428 --> 00:59:53,341
- Malia!

1332
00:59:53,341 --> 00:59:55,209
- Louis, the amulet.

1333
00:59:55,209 --> 00:59:57,941
- Guys, you guys,
there's somebody down there.

1334
00:59:57,941 --> 00:59:59,149
- It's Doyle!
- It's Doyle.

1335
00:59:59,149 --> 00:59:59,982
Doyle!

1336
00:59:59,982 --> 01:00:01,289
- Doyle!
- Doyle!

1337
01:00:01,289 --> 01:00:02,122
- Doyle!

1338
01:00:02,122 --> 01:00:03,294
What's he doing?

1339
01:00:03,294 --> 01:00:04,976
- He can't save you now.

1340
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:06,240
- What?

1341
01:00:09,197 --> 01:00:10,947
- What the...

1342
01:00:13,089 --> 01:00:14,557
- I'm sorry.

1343
01:00:14,557 --> 01:00:16,262
- Malia, Malia, don't be sorry.

1344
01:00:16,262 --> 01:00:17,095
Look at me.

1345
01:00:17,095 --> 01:00:17,928
Look at me.

1346
01:00:17,928 --> 01:00:18,761
Malia.

1347
01:00:20,941 --> 01:00:21,774
- Help me!

1348
01:00:21,774 --> 01:00:22,607
Help!

1349
01:00:22,607 --> 01:00:23,440
Help!

1350
01:00:25,412 --> 01:00:26,394
- Malia!

1351
01:00:27,312 --> 01:00:28,145
- Oh my god!

1352
01:00:31,332 --> 01:00:32,582
Louis, come on!

1353
01:00:33,498 --> 01:00:34,331
Louis!

1354
01:00:36,629 --> 01:00:39,129
Louis, help me with this door!

1355
01:00:41,809 --> 01:00:42,742
It won't budge.

1356
01:00:42,742 --> 01:00:43,992
It won't budge.

1357
01:00:45,459 --> 01:00:50,435
- I was just there
and there was a dead end!

1358
01:00:50,435 --> 01:00:52,683
- That door's open.

1359
01:01:06,247 --> 01:01:09,664
- Guys, is that one of Jackson's cameras?

1360
01:02:04,193 --> 01:02:05,443
- Back this up.

1361
01:02:16,849 --> 01:02:19,031
- Oh no, oh no, oh no!

1362
01:02:22,432 --> 01:02:24,500
Got it, got it!

1363
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:26,667
- Come on, Louis!

1364
01:02:33,121 --> 01:02:34,871
This has gotta be it.

1365
01:02:47,797 --> 01:02:48,861
The floor's on fire!

1366
01:02:48,861 --> 01:02:51,297
- No, that's what
it wants us to think.

1367
01:02:51,297 --> 01:02:52,730
It wants us to turn back.

1368
01:02:52,730 --> 01:02:55,313
I don't see any flames, do you?

1369
01:02:57,671 --> 01:02:59,754
- It feels real.

1370
01:03:00,949 --> 01:03:04,230
- Keep looking, keep looking.

1371
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:06,782
- Where the hell do we go?

1372
01:03:06,782 --> 01:03:08,705
- All I can see is
two feet in front of my face.

1373
01:03:11,938 --> 01:03:13,855
- What is that?

1374
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:18,239
- I think I see a light up ahead.

1375
01:03:18,239 --> 01:03:21,489
- I can't see anything either.

1376
01:03:23,155 --> 01:03:24,988
- Wait, Malia?

1377
01:03:28,694 --> 01:03:29,789
Malia!

1378
01:03:29,789 --> 01:03:30,622
- Malia!
- Malia!

1379
01:03:31,455 --> 01:03:32,428
- No, wait, come back!

1380
01:03:32,428 --> 01:03:33,547
Help us!

1381
01:03:37,467 --> 01:03:38,565
- She tricked us.

1382
01:03:38,565 --> 01:03:40,020
- No, she wouldn't
bring us down here

1383
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:41,237
without a reason!

1384
01:03:41,237 --> 01:03:42,070
Here!

1385
01:03:44,519 --> 01:03:45,756
See, told you!

1386
01:03:45,756 --> 01:03:48,930
See, see, told you, fire escape!

1387
01:03:48,930 --> 01:03:50,007
- It's blocked off!

1388
01:03:50,007 --> 01:03:53,007
- We have to go up, come on.

1389
01:04:01,876 --> 01:04:04,209
- Shell, call Doyle.

1390
01:04:08,461 --> 01:04:11,044
- It's his voice mail.

1391
01:04:13,888 --> 01:04:15,197
Doyle, Doyle!

1392
01:04:15,197 --> 01:04:17,183
We're trapped at the hotel.

1393
01:04:17,183 --> 01:04:19,184
Doyle, you gotta wake up, man.

1394
01:04:19,184 --> 01:04:22,601
You're right, we're trapped at the hotel.

1395
01:04:23,785 --> 01:04:26,879
Please hurry, there's not much time.

1396
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:27,894
You'll never make it.

1397
01:04:27,894 --> 01:04:29,430
- No, fuck that, he's
just downstairs in his car,

1398
01:04:29,430 --> 01:04:30,664
he'll come.

1399
01:04:30,664 --> 01:04:32,664
Find something to throw.

1400
01:04:42,412 --> 01:04:45,518
- There's nothing up here.

1401
01:04:45,518 --> 01:04:46,851
- Paige?

1402
01:04:48,169 --> 01:04:49,002
Paige?

1403
01:04:49,935 --> 01:04:50,768
Paige?

1404
01:04:52,535 --> 01:04:54,136
- Are you okay?

1405
01:04:54,136 --> 01:04:55,719
What are you doing?

1406
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:59,973
- I don't have a choice.

1407
01:04:59,973 --> 01:05:02,273
I have to do this.

1408
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:04,879
- No, no you don't.

1409
01:05:04,879 --> 01:05:06,976
Paige, you're stronger than this.

1410
01:05:06,976 --> 01:05:10,210
You are the strongest person I know.

1411
01:05:10,210 --> 01:05:14,127
Whatever this is, you
don't let it control you.

1412
01:05:16,732 --> 01:05:19,482
- So now I'm strong, huh, Shelly?

1413
01:05:20,432 --> 01:05:24,599
For years, you've walked
all over me, and I let you,

1414
01:05:26,919 --> 01:05:29,086
because I believed in you.

1415
01:05:31,236 --> 01:05:32,821
Now I see who you really are.

1416
01:05:32,821 --> 01:05:34,238
- Paige.

1417
01:05:35,539 --> 01:05:38,991
- I let you into my life, and for what?

1418
01:05:38,991 --> 01:05:40,591
You used me!

1419
01:05:40,591 --> 01:05:43,258
Just like you use anyone you can

1420
01:05:44,167 --> 01:05:45,917
to get what you want.

1421
01:05:49,879 --> 01:05:53,497
Even the people that
you're supposed to love.

1422
01:05:57,530 --> 01:05:59,923
I don't know why you
put up with him, Louis.

1423
01:05:59,923 --> 01:06:02,552
He's your brother and he's using you too.

1424
01:06:02,552 --> 01:06:04,052
- Paige, I'm glad
you're finally getting this

1425
01:06:04,052 --> 01:06:08,845
off your chest, but we can
get through this, we can.

1426
01:06:08,845 --> 01:06:09,678
- No.

1427
01:06:13,665 --> 01:06:14,597
It's too late for that.

1428
01:06:15,950 --> 01:06:16,783
- No!

1429
01:06:22,671 --> 01:06:24,404
- Not so fast, Shelly!

1430
01:06:24,404 --> 01:06:25,958
We're not done with you yet.

1431
01:06:25,958 --> 01:06:27,678
- What do you want from me?

1432
01:06:31,994 --> 01:06:34,441
- You're okay!

1433
01:06:34,441 --> 01:06:35,785
Stay with us, Paige!

1434
01:06:35,785 --> 01:06:37,767
- He's still here.

1435
01:06:37,767 --> 01:06:39,100
He's still here.

1436
01:06:40,809 --> 01:06:42,993
He's telling me to do things.

1437
01:06:42,993 --> 01:06:44,691
He's too strong.

1438
01:06:44,691 --> 01:06:45,545
He's too strong.

1439
01:06:45,545 --> 01:06:47,962
- You gotta fight it.

1440
01:06:54,296 --> 01:06:57,228
- There's nothing to be afraid of, Louis.

1441
01:06:57,228 --> 01:07:00,395
- Don't talk like that, Paige.

1442
01:07:01,833 --> 01:07:03,750
- It's too late for me.

1443
01:07:06,419 --> 01:07:07,252
But you,

1444
01:07:11,603 --> 01:07:13,186
you're almost home.

1445
01:07:14,523 --> 01:07:15,655
- No!

1446
01:07:15,655 --> 01:07:16,489
- Paige!

1447
01:07:16,489 --> 01:07:17,822
- Paige!

1448
01:07:21,691 --> 01:07:22,524
Oh god!

1449
01:07:27,965 --> 01:07:28,798
Paige.

1450
01:08:08,669 --> 01:08:10,022
- You okay, man?

1451
01:08:10,022 --> 01:08:10,967
- Why?

1452
01:08:10,967 --> 01:08:12,321
- You okay, man?

1453
01:08:12,321 --> 01:08:13,154
- Why?

1454
01:08:22,029 --> 01:08:24,226
- We're gonna go.

1455
01:08:24,226 --> 01:08:27,309
Shell, we're gonna get off this roof.

1456
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:34,934
- I'm not leaving Paige.

1457
01:08:34,934 --> 01:08:35,767
I'm not leaving her.

1458
01:08:35,767 --> 01:08:36,765
- We're not safe here, man.

1459
01:08:36,765 --> 01:08:39,832
- Stay until the sun comes up,

1460
01:08:39,832 --> 01:08:41,832
and then just wait here.

1461
01:08:45,372 --> 01:08:47,229
- I don't wanna leave Paige either, okay,

1462
01:08:47,229 --> 01:08:49,573
but you saw what happened to her, man.

1463
01:08:49,573 --> 01:08:51,965
We're not safe here, not
anywhere in this building,

1464
01:08:51,965 --> 01:08:53,605
not even on the roof, okay?

1465
01:08:53,605 --> 01:08:54,855
We've gotta go.

1466
01:08:55,872 --> 01:08:58,372
We've gotta get off this roof.

1467
01:08:59,221 --> 01:09:00,202
Shell.

1468
01:09:00,202 --> 01:09:01,223
- She's right.

1469
01:09:01,223 --> 01:09:02,873
- What?

1470
01:09:02,873 --> 01:09:04,358
- About me.

1471
01:09:04,358 --> 01:09:05,191
- No.

1472
01:09:06,558 --> 01:09:07,391
- Yeah.

1473
01:09:08,429 --> 01:09:09,457
It's all my fault.

1474
01:09:09,457 --> 01:09:10,624
- No, man, no.

1475
01:09:12,412 --> 01:09:14,392
We gotta go, okay?

1476
01:09:14,392 --> 01:09:15,392
We gotta go.

1477
01:09:16,408 --> 01:09:17,464
All right, let's go.

1478
01:09:17,464 --> 01:09:18,427
Come on, Shell.

1479
01:09:18,427 --> 01:09:20,677
Come on, stay with me, man.

1480
01:09:24,964 --> 01:09:26,685
Come on, come on.

1481
01:09:26,685 --> 01:09:27,518
Okay?

1482
01:09:33,923 --> 01:09:37,256
- Fuck this fucking hotel, man.

1483
01:09:52,988 --> 01:09:54,738
- What the...

1484
01:09:56,492 --> 01:09:58,325
It's the same hallway!

1485
01:09:59,872 --> 01:10:02,127
- We were just here.

1486
01:10:02,127 --> 01:10:02,960
Let's go.

1487
01:10:18,617 --> 01:10:20,617
I don't think he saw us.

1488
01:10:29,238 --> 01:10:30,348
- Hold on, hold on, Shell!

1489
01:10:30,348 --> 01:10:31,181
Hold on!

1490
01:10:41,929 --> 01:10:43,414
Keep holding it, just keep holding it.

1491
01:10:43,414 --> 01:10:44,747
Keep holding it.

1492
01:10:52,895 --> 01:10:54,010
Just keep holding it.

1493
01:10:54,010 --> 01:10:55,760
Just keep holding it.

1494
01:10:57,157 --> 01:11:01,324
- I thought he didn't see us.

1495
01:11:03,591 --> 01:11:05,448
- It's okay, man, it's okay.

1496
01:11:05,448 --> 01:11:07,128
We're gonna make it.

1497
01:11:07,128 --> 01:11:10,628
I know it, I know it, we're gonna make it.

1498
01:11:18,216 --> 01:11:20,817
- I've been a pretty shitty brother.

1499
01:11:20,817 --> 01:11:21,650
- What?

1500
01:11:25,151 --> 01:11:25,984
No, man.

1501
01:11:30,192 --> 01:11:34,640
You gave me my first camera.

1502
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:35,976
- And I broke it too.

1503
01:11:37,711 --> 01:11:38,775
- Yeah.

1504
01:11:38,775 --> 01:11:39,858
Yeah you did.

1505
01:11:44,962 --> 01:11:45,795
- Hey.

1506
01:11:47,573 --> 01:11:48,529
- Huh?

1507
01:11:48,529 --> 01:11:52,529
- Let's kick some ass and
get the fuck out of here.

1508
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:55,493
- Yeah right.

1509
01:11:57,201 --> 01:11:58,579
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1510
01:11:58,579 --> 01:12:00,181
Come on, bro.

1511
01:12:00,181 --> 01:12:01,180
Let's go.

1512
01:12:01,180 --> 01:12:02,013
Come on.

1513
01:14:14,925 --> 01:14:16,258
- Shell.

1514
01:14:17,447 --> 01:14:18,364
The amulet.

1515
01:14:36,406 --> 01:14:38,708
- Hang on, hang on, hang on!

1516
01:14:38,708 --> 01:14:39,939
Louis!

1517
01:14:39,939 --> 01:14:40,772
- Shelly!

1518
01:14:47,383 --> 01:14:48,800
- Where'd she go?

1519
01:15:07,004 --> 01:15:07,965
- Come on, we're almost there!

1520
01:15:07,965 --> 01:15:09,632
We're gonna make it!

1521
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:16,880
- Hey, Jackson.

1522
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:19,047
It's good to see you, man.

1523
01:15:23,453 --> 01:15:24,753
We saw this tape.

1524
01:15:24,753 --> 01:15:27,253
We thought you were dead, man.

1525
01:15:29,988 --> 01:15:31,388
- Dead.

1526
01:15:31,388 --> 01:15:32,221
Alive.

1527
01:15:33,958 --> 01:15:36,944
Those have no meaning here.

1528
01:15:36,944 --> 01:15:39,694
- What's wrong with you, man?

1529
01:15:39,694 --> 01:15:40,876
- Jackson,

1530
01:15:40,876 --> 01:15:44,253
it's fucked up what happened to you, man,

1531
01:15:44,253 --> 01:15:45,313
and everybody,

1532
01:15:45,313 --> 01:15:47,480
but we got Maria's amulet.

1533
01:15:49,766 --> 01:15:50,599
We got it from the room, man.

1534
01:15:50,599 --> 01:15:53,432
We just need to get out that door.

1535
01:15:55,690 --> 01:15:58,031
- Are you rolling, Louis?

1536
01:15:58,031 --> 01:15:59,810
- What?

1537
01:16:05,395 --> 01:16:09,562
- Don't you wanna prove that
something like me exists?

1538
01:16:11,832 --> 01:16:15,535
- Please, please
just let us go, man.

1539
01:16:15,535 --> 01:16:17,618
- I can be stabbed, hung,

1540
01:16:19,835 --> 01:16:21,335
dragged, helpless,

1541
01:16:24,530 --> 01:16:25,363
tortured,

1542
01:16:27,539 --> 01:16:28,456
like Malia,

1543
01:16:31,051 --> 01:16:31,884
like Elsa,

1544
01:16:34,276 --> 01:16:35,609
like your bitch,

1545
01:16:36,869 --> 01:16:37,702
Paige.

1546
01:16:40,891 --> 01:16:44,163
- We didn't mean to do this.

1547
01:16:44,163 --> 01:16:47,179
- Stop fucking with us, Jackson!

1548
01:16:47,179 --> 01:16:48,179
- No, Louis.

1549
01:16:50,581 --> 01:16:53,414
I'm gonna show you the other side.

1550
01:16:55,811 --> 01:16:57,561
Just like you wanted!

1551
01:17:06,296 --> 01:17:08,684
- Doyle, Doyle, you gotta wake up, man!

1552
01:17:08,684 --> 01:17:09,936
You gotta wake up, you were right!

1553
01:17:09,936 --> 01:17:11,075
We should not have gone in there!

1554
01:17:11,075 --> 01:17:13,291
Everybody's dead!

1555
01:17:13,291 --> 01:17:14,805
Everybody's dead!

1556
01:17:14,805 --> 01:17:16,721
Come on, Doyle, you gotta.

1557
01:17:16,721 --> 01:17:20,312
What are you doing?
- What the hell?

1558
01:17:20,312 --> 01:17:21,278
- Doyle!

1559
01:17:21,278 --> 01:17:22,111
Doyle, what are you doing?

1560
01:17:22,111 --> 01:17:23,622
Doyle!

1561
01:17:23,622 --> 01:17:24,669
- What the hell?

1562
01:17:24,669 --> 01:17:25,502
Whoa, shit.

1563
01:17:25,502 --> 01:17:26,975
- Doyle, don't go in
there, they're gonna kill us!

1564
01:17:26,975 --> 01:17:28,392
- Goddamn idiots.

1565
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:35,993
Nice day.

1566
01:17:37,551 --> 01:17:40,051
I told them not to go in here.

1567
01:17:43,713 --> 01:17:44,546
Hello?

1568
01:17:46,997 --> 01:17:47,830
Hello?

1569
01:17:48,991 --> 01:17:50,074
Anybody home?
