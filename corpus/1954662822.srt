1
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:30,996
This guy on the radio went

2
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:32,197
prattling on about
some second-hand

3
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:34,566
Freudian shit about how
adultery is the last

4
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:36,301
rebellious act left
to people in these

5
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:37,803
structured modern times.

6
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:40,039
You've got to get up, get out

7
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:41,340
and do something, man.

8
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,542
Yeah, I told him
I get these migraines.

9
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:46,045
Man, it's like a
phone in my head that

10
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:47,679
keeps ringing. You know?

11
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:49,048
Just ringing.

12
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,315
It's stress.

13
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:52,117
Ringing, ringing.

14
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,218
It builds up, man.

15
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,720
And nobody even answers.

16
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,529
Did you feel an
earthquake last night?

17
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:58,690
Nah.

18
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:00,993
Nada.

19
00:01:00,995 --> 00:01:02,327
No I ain't feel nothing.

20
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:05,064
Well, the TV
said there was a 4.4,

21
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:08,233
and it hit at exactly 4:04 a.m.

22
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:10,135
That's creepy.

23
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,404
How did you not
feel anything though?

24
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:14,406
I don't know.
How did you feel it?

25
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:15,641
Man, your bed shakes.

26
00:01:15,643 --> 00:01:17,676
Nigger, my bed
shakes every night.

27
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:20,179
Get the fuck out of here man.

28
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:21,480
Gangster!

29
00:01:21,482 --> 00:01:22,681
Man, what you know
about that man?

30
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:23,849
Man I'm hitting switches on

31
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:25,017
bitches like I was
fixed with hydraulics

32
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:26,899
up and down like
a roller coaster.

33
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:30,055
Oh Tupac, huh?

34
00:01:30,057 --> 00:01:31,623
You old hologram man singing.

35
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:33,992
Oh man, shit.

36
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,394
Now tell me again about

37
00:01:35,396 --> 00:01:37,356
these little sex toys
you designed, man.

38
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:39,598
I didn't design
no sex toys, man.

39
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,833
Oh come on, man.

40
00:01:40,835 --> 00:01:44,136
You know the toys,
the little dildo shit.

41
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:45,904
No, no, no, no.

42
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:47,372
I said there was
interest from a sex toy

43
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:49,741
manufacturer in an
ad that I designed.

44
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,577
It was just an ad, that's all,

45
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:52,711
but it could have been
for anything really.

46
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,012
Oh, what'd you call it?

47
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:55,114
Space Invader.

48
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:58,417
Yeah, new sci-fi movie.

49
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,956
Hey little cute ass Shelby girl

50
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,039
looking over here, man.

51
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:10,028
I'm going to take 10.

52
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,336
Man this nigger a bitch.

53
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:21,273
Hey, what's up?

54
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:22,107
Hey.

55
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:25,644
How's it going?

56
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:28,780
Is that Douglas?

57
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:34,720
So, what's the deal?

58
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:37,556
Nothing I
just wanted to see you.

59
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,024
Well, I'll be home in a

60
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:39,986
couple of hours.

61
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:42,928
Baby -

62
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:43,762
What?

63
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:45,531
How much?

64
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:47,900
Enough, all right?

65
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:49,735
Baby -

66
00:02:50,938 --> 00:02:51,937
Yes, baby?

67
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:53,172
Could you imagine your

68
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:54,134
life without me?

69
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:07,098
That's a loaded question.

70
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,226
Baby -

71
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:15,827
Yes sweetie?

72
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:20,432
I'm pregnant.

73
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:23,669
Fuck.

74
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:34,313
You have insurance?

75
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:35,914
What?

76
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:37,683
Maybe I should get you

77
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:38,617
a hotel room.

78
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:41,220
Why?

79
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:43,188
You know to thin the blood,

80
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,456
champagne and hot tub.

81
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:47,693
It's a poor woman's miscarriage.

82
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:59,571
Look, it's just not
the right time. Okay?

83
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,241
Look at me.

84
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,010
Look at me.

85
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,179
I love you. Okay?

86
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:09,815
Okay?

87
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:17,089
The important thing is
that when it happens,

88
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:22,227
however it happens, it's
got to be the right time.

89
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:23,462
You've got to be ready.

90
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:30,969
I mean things have
to fall into place.

91
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:32,671
I mean come on, we
had an understsanding

92
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:33,513
about this.

93
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,540
I know.

94
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:43,181
We cool?

95
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,320
Yeah, we're cool.

96
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:54,626
You all right?

97
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,430
Yeah.

98
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,291
Fuck, I've got to run back.

99
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,537
So I'll see you tonight?

100
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,531
The postwar
generation found solace

101
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:35,067
in the austere arms
of existentialism.

102
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:38,503
It is the choice that
gives value to the act.

103
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:41,098
Seemed to be a grand
idea at the time.

104
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:46,111
For as Dostoevsky brilliantly
put it,.

105
00:05:46,113 --> 00:05:49,781
Now Jean-Paul Sartre
on the other hand,

106
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:51,683
declared that a person
cannot define himself

107
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:55,420
by disappointed dreams,
miscarried hopes

108
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:56,755
or vain expectations.

109
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,424
So when this
disillusioned commie who

110
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:01,593
saw human nature in
all its shades of gray

111
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:04,262
was asked, "Who is
the hero of our time?"

112
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:09,201
His answer was simple, "It
is the man on the run."

113
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:31,770
Sweetie.

114
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:35,073
Hm?

115
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:37,809
You awake?

116
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:47,385
Baby -

117
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:50,589
What?

118
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:54,392
I want it.

119
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:05,103
How bad do you want it?

120
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,141
I want... it.

121
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:14,479
Ah, no Sierrah come on.

122
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:15,747
We've already been through this.

123
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:17,449
Why not? Why
not give it a try?

124
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:18,817
Why not go through with it?

125
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:19,951
Go through with it?

126
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:21,920
Yeah.

127
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:23,402
You say it
like it's a good thing.

128
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:25,023
I mean come on Varnie.

129
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:26,626
It's not like you're
getting any younger.

130
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:28,059
I think it's time to start -

131
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:29,060
Time for what?

132
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:30,462
Time for me to give up on myself

133
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:31,963
and bury my fucking dreams?

134
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:33,331
No.

135
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:35,300
I'm just saying.

136
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:36,768
No, that's what
you're saying though.

137
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,036
It's like, "This guy ain't
getting anywhere with his shit.

138
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:39,237
He needs to strap up,
put on a tie and get

139
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:40,438
a real job." Right?

140
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,373
That's bullshit, Varnie.

141
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,607
I've always supported you.

142
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:43,742
Don't make this about -

143
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:44,909
I'm not on your clock.

144
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:46,144
I understand that.

145
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,078
I'm not on
your fucking timeline.

146
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,046
I know you're not -

147
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:48,880
Do you understand me?

148
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:49,848
My timeline.

149
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:50,782
Do you understand me?

150
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:52,017
Varnie! Come on!

151
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,351
What if
it's a C-section?

152
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:54,586
You're the one who's
going to have to wear

153
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:55,553
a fucking tie for
the rest of your life

154
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:56,721
every time you go to the beach.

155
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:57,689
Well, it's my body and I'll

156
00:10:57,691 --> 00:10:58,891
do what I want to do with it.

157
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:00,158
Yeah, well tell the doctor not

158
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,059
to put an extra stitch
for daddy because

159
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:01,793
this motherfucker is out.

160
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:02,661
Wait.

161
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:03,703
Wait, you're leaving?

162
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,063
You about to fucking go?

163
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,366
Niggers ain't shit.

164
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:20,945
Varnie.

165
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:23,248
Varnie!

166
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,149
What Sierrah?

167
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:25,283
What do you want from me?

168
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:26,451
I just want to talk about it.

169
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:27,385
What? To let
you bury me alive

170
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:28,186
because you're fucking bored?

171
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,454
I'm not bored.

172
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:32,223
Well you think
this fucking baby

173
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:33,458
is going to fix anything?

174
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,926
I don't need
a baby to fix anything.

175
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:35,727
What? Do you think
it's going to give you

176
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:36,895
some sort of meaning?

177
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:37,896
It will give us a meaning.

178
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:39,197
There is no fucking us.

179
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,534
Get that stupid fucking
idea out of your head.

180
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:43,668
Oh God, I just want us

181
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,636
to have it.

182
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:46,571
I'm having it.

183
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:48,239
You stupid bitch.

184
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,841
I'm having it.

185
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:50,809
You stupid bitch.

186
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:51,976
I'm having it.

187
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:53,445
You stupid fucking bitch.

188
00:11:53,447 --> 00:11:54,913
I'm having it!
You stupid fucking bitch!

189
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:56,476
I'm having it!
You stupid fucking bitch!

190
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:58,750
You're like a string-a-long,
like a fucking

191
00:11:58,752 --> 00:12:00,185
shitty-ass job.

192
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,294
It's your life Varnie.

193
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,329
I can't tell you what to do.

194
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,965
It's your decision, just
know that your child

195
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:16,534
will be out there rolling
just like one of your

196
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:18,103
product-less brands.

197
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:21,906
You can come by anytime you want

198
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,442
or if you want I
can give you a call.

199
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,515
Fuck you!

200
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:06,751
Good morning.

201
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,654
Are you with the rugby team?

202
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:11,656
What?

203
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:13,258
Are you one of the players?

204
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,994
Uh, no. I
don't play rugby.

205
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:16,995
Why not?

206
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:20,632
I work at the post office.

207
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,233
Are you delivering?

208
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:24,169
Yes, I do but in Salzburg.

209
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:25,003
What?

210
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:26,237
That's in Austria.

211
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:27,872
So, what are you doing here?

212
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,507
I'm here for Blonde Priest.

213
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:30,675
What?

214
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:32,010
Blonde Priest.

215
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:33,111
Blonde Priest?

216
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:34,112
Yes.

217
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:38,082
Are you like religious?

218
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,519
I love them all.

219
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:46,324
So you have a delivery
for a blonde priest?

220
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,626
No, I'm here for their concert.

221
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,361
You're here for
Blonde Priest concert?

222
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:51,362
Yes.

223
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:53,198
Is that like a rock band?

224
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,833
Jawohl! F nf.

225
00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:58,803
What?

226
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,174
Actually they're kind of folky,

227
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,876
Americana, Dylan-ish.

228
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:06,878
They were originally
called Sweat Breads,

229
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,812
but they changed it.

230
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:09,080
They played two days ago.

231
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:10,515
Yes, I'm aware
of this, but you see

232
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:13,618
my flight was
cancelled or suspended

233
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,287
actually because of
another volcano in Iceland.

234
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,356
I'm sure it's been all
over the news here.

235
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,191
You see all flights
were grounded because

236
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,559
of the smoke.

237
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:24,195
On top of that I had to
get a connection Chicago

238
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,097
and that plane got
hit by a truck right

239
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:27,398
before take off.

240
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,800
Your plane got hit by a truck?

241
00:14:28,802 --> 00:14:30,368
Yes. A loading
truck with luggage.

242
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:33,104
Like what the fuck?

243
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:34,973
One of the teamsters.

244
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,674
He was -

245
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:42,580
We all had to evacuate,
but anyways I was

246
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:47,919
hoping to replace these
tickets for the ones of

247
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:49,921
their next gig because
you know I missed

248
00:14:49,923 --> 00:14:52,590
this one due to a
natural disaster,

249
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:57,061
and it states here
that I'm eligible

250
00:14:57,063 --> 00:15:00,431
for an exchange or a refund,
but I don't want a refund.

251
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:03,201
You see, there's a
paragraph which states this.

252
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:07,505
So here and the original
plane ticket here.

253
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,245
I'm going to call my manager

254
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,328
and see what he can do.

255
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:17,682
He's a tough-ass puto.

256
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:22,887
, there's this
girl here who missed

257
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,969
the concert that was
here like two days ago

258
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:29,260
and she missed it because
like of the ice melting

259
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:32,263
or some shit like the
ozone layers so now she

260
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:35,533
wants us to buy her a
ticket to like Australia.

261
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,369
Okay.

262
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:41,005
He'll be right here.

263
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:42,740
Thank you.

264
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,949
You see Terry,
in the poem Au Lecteur

265
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:53,151
that prefaces Le Fleurs
du Mal, Baudelaire

266
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:55,920
accuses his readers of
hypocrisy and of being

267
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:59,057
as guilty of sins and
lies as the poet himself.

268
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:03,061
And I quote, "If rape or
arson, poison or the knife

269
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:04,896
has woven a pleasing
patterns in the stuff

270
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:07,532
of the canvas we accept as life

271
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,127
it is because we are
not bold enough."

272
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,138
You're back?

273
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,820
Just to pick up some shit.

274
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:18,076
You look tired.

275
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:19,698
You look like a bus driver.

276
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,981
I've been stress eating a lot.

277
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:24,649
Right.

278
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:25,583
I get the wrong
e-mail and I kill

279
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:26,884
a jar of Nutella.

280
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:33,891
I started up a
Twitter for that thing.

281
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,961
I know. I've
got over 200 followers.

282
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,263
Most of them porn stars.

283
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,702
Your shit is in the garage
and your room is rented.

284
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:57,615
He was like,
"You got a nice accent

285
00:16:57,617 --> 00:16:59,537
you can get away
with a lot of shit."

286
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:02,420
Because you know you
can be at the club

287
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:05,023
saying some foul stuff
to a woman and if

288
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:07,992
you're saying it to her
in a nice posh English

289
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:10,595
accent she'll still
think you're sexy.

290
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:13,231
Dad, I'm going to LA.

291
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:17,935
Moving actually.

292
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,507
I'll be staying with Cliff.

293
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:27,945
But what ain't
sexy is that Indian

294
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:29,614
sounding shit.

295
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:31,749
He was like, "No
woman wants some

296
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:35,586
guy on top of her going
oh I'm giving it to you.

297
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,189
Say my name, say Punjab."

298
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:52,096
Hey yo what's up nigger?

299
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:53,438

00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:55,706

00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:05,883
Yo my lady, peep that out.

310
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:06,851

That's the wrong

314
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,022
This the hottest

315
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:12,256
MC Shit.

316
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:13,524
What else you got nigger?

317
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:14,992
You need this in your life.

318
00:18:14,994 --> 00:18:16,461
First name

319
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,396
Yeah, it's just
like that guy on the streets

320
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:19,564
will tell us, man.

321
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:20,965
There's only two
ways out of the rain,

322
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:23,801
one shoulders or on a
stretcher, but right now -

323
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:25,169
Fuck! I've got to go cop.

324
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:28,873
Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! I'm here man.

325
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:32,143
If don't
report every five minutes

326
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:34,445
to a dispatcher police
patrol will come

327
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,013
and check on -

328
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:38,716
Look, I was
just on the phone man.

329
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:40,238
It must have just
expired a second ago.

330
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:43,521
It starts
blinking two minutes after it -

331
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,623
So what? Is that it?

332
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,626
- I
- Already have your -

333
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:53,898
Man, fuck you then.

334
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:20,658
Fuck out the way!

335
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:26,864
Fuck!

336
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:37,875
Everything all right?

337
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:38,876
Sir, I'm going to have to ask

338
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:40,511
you to step aside and -

339
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:41,879
Nobody talking
to your bitch ass, man.

340
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:43,147
I'm making sure she's all right.

341
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:43,948
I'm going
to ask you one more -

342
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:44,615
No, no, no, no.

343
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:45,283
There's no need.

344
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:46,083
It was my fault.

345
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:47,385
You see I'm daltonic.

346
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:48,953
I'm color blind.

347
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:54,025
I've developed a fear of

348
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:56,427
a completed sentence
ever since -

349
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:04,635
Yeah, I was
confused with the -

350
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:12,343
I was wondering how to
get to the train station.

351
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:13,544
I can take you there.

352
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:15,213
I'm heading that way, so -

353
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:18,282
Great! Great
yeah that's super.

354
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,984
You know
you might be better off

355
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:23,254
if a police officer gave
you a ride ever since

356
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:24,789
you can't see -

357
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,091
We're cool. Thank you.

358
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:29,393
I win.

359
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:30,728
Thank you, really.

360
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:33,798
Bye.

361
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:51,882
Is he following me?

362
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:55,720
You know I did feel the tension

363
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:57,121
between the two of you.

364
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:58,589
Tension?

365
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:00,524
He thought I was a thug.

366
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:03,261
They are probably
trained to think that way.

367
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:04,762
He voted McCain and supports

368
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,330
that Florida pastor that wants

369
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:07,332
to burn the Koran.

370
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,938
It's nice, Oakland.

371
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:16,954
Are you fucking kidding me?

372
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:21,445
No. It's urban
decay and piercing

373
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:24,282
smell of urine, give
it so much character.

374
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,284
Yeah well in
English we say hood.

375
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,585
Hood.

376
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,654
No, no, no. Hood.

377
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:34,525
Hood. Hood. Hood.

378
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:35,526
No forget it. Forget it.

379
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:38,229
So where you from?

380
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,831
I'm from Berlin,
Germany, but I live

381
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:41,832
in Austria.

382
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:43,334
Austria?

383
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:45,770
Yes, near
Salzburg, a little town

384
00:21:45,772 --> 00:21:47,872
called famous for making

385
00:21:47,874 --> 00:21:49,106
Mozartkugel.

386
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:50,508
Huh?

387
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,543
Mozart balls.

388
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:54,812
You want to try one?

389
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,113
What are you talking about?

390
00:21:56,115 --> 00:22:00,418
It's a ball of
green pistachio marzipan

391
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:03,220
covered in a layer
of nougat and dunked

392
00:22:03,222 --> 00:22:06,123
in chocolate, made by
hand and because Salzburg

393
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,526
was Mozart's birth
town we put his

394
00:22:08,528 --> 00:22:13,064
face on everything, even pills
for restless leg syndrome.

395
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:14,598
What?

396
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,766
Mozartkugel.

397
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,208
No, it's okay.

398
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,443
Go on, try one. It's good.

399
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:49,233
Hm. That's
some good shit.

400
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:50,634
Yeah. It's good, huh?

401
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:52,303
Yeah, das is good shit.

402
00:22:52,305 --> 00:22:53,337
Yeah!

403
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,442
You know? Movies?

404
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,565
So what are
you doing here anyway?

405
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:03,247
Well, I was
supposed to be here two

406
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:08,953
days ago to attend a
Blonde Priest concert,

407
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:12,423
but I was stuck in Austria
because of the volcano.

408
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:17,161
No flights were allowed so
now I exchange the tickets.

409
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:19,764
I have two tickets and
I have to make it to

410
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:21,565
San Bernadino by tomorrow night.

411
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:22,867
That's when they perform.

412
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:25,102
So now I'm trying to
figure out how to get

413
00:23:25,104 --> 00:23:26,504
there to see them play.

414
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:27,738
Do you know Blonde Priest?

415
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,006
Nope.

416
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:30,569
I've never heard
them perform live.

417
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:32,810
But you don't know
how many times

418
00:23:32,812 --> 00:23:34,111
I've played it out in my head.

419
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:35,413
Oh yeah?

420
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:36,647
It's going to be super.

421
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:38,549
Well I can drop you off in LA.

422
00:23:38,551 --> 00:23:39,817
I mean I'm heading that way.

423
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:41,919
Yeah? would you?

424
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:43,354
Yeah, sure.

425
00:23:43,356 --> 00:23:44,588
Thank you.

426
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,222
From there you can probably

427
00:23:45,224 --> 00:23:46,056
catch a bus.

428
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:47,224
Yes or a train.

429
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:48,459
As long as you don't mind

430
00:23:48,461 --> 00:23:49,393
sitting next to a guy
with an aluminum walker.

431
00:23:49,395 --> 00:23:50,728
Thank you. Really.

432
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:51,862
No, it's fine.

433
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:52,930
I just want to piss
off this cop and

434
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,298
his little asshole vehicle.

435
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,599
Thank you.

436
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,268
Stop saying
thank you. Please.

437
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:01,038
Gratitude is a milder
form of revenge.

438
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,852
Say what's your name?

439
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:25,856
Yo!

440
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:29,693
I'm sorry.

441
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:30,694
What's your name?

442
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:33,564
Oh, Nena. Like the band.

443
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:35,699
What band?

444
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,234
Nena, you know?

445
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:39,303
The first German new wave.

446
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,172
99 Luftballons

447
00:25:42,174 --> 00:25:44,308
Auf ihrem Weg zum Horizont

448
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,110
Hielt man fr Ufos aus dem All

449
00:25:46,112 --> 00:25:48,279
Darum schickte ein General

450
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:49,480
'ne Fliegerstaffel hinterher -

451
00:25:49,482 --> 00:25:50,548
Okay. Calm down.

452
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:54,418
What's your name?

453
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:56,220
Varnie.

454
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:57,488
Varnie?

455
00:25:57,789 --> 00:25:58,722
With a V.

456
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:01,725
How cool.

457
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:04,428
You know if I guessed
by your name I'd

458
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,263
say you are the coolest guy.

459
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:07,731
If I guessed by your name I'd

460
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,099
say you were big and dyke.

461
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:14,004
The first impression
goes a long way.

462
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,172
The first thing I told you was

463
00:26:15,174 --> 00:26:16,173
to fuck off.

464
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:17,708
Yeah, this is true but the

465
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:21,345
way in which you
unloaded your frustration

466
00:26:21,347 --> 00:26:23,213
was very respectable.

467
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:25,583
You looked me
straight in the eyes

468
00:26:25,585 --> 00:26:26,917
and it's off your chest.

469
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,652
Very few people can do that.

470
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,988
The rest of them internalize

471
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:33,157
and grow a canker sore.

472
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:35,025
Interesting perspective.

473
00:26:35,027 --> 00:26:36,694
Yeah. That's
what I'm saying.

474
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:38,696
The perspective, you know?

475
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,799
Most people are unable
to shift the perspective

476
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,568
and that ability to
shift the perspective is

477
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:46,604
the true power, you know?

478
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:50,975
We see someone who's
dying of cancer

479
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:55,613
and it's tragic and
sad, but we never step

480
00:26:55,615 --> 00:26:58,248
back to celebrate the
triumph of the cancer

481
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,817
or at least give it credit.

482
00:26:59,819 --> 00:27:02,219
I mean you know the
little fucker resisted

483
00:27:02,221 --> 00:27:04,455
all the treatments
and survived the chemo

484
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:06,223
and it won't want
to back down and let

485
00:27:06,225 --> 00:27:07,858
anything get in the
way of its mission.

486
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,026
You know?

487
00:27:09,028 --> 00:27:10,948
It fucking did what
it set out to do.

488
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:13,864
And that has its place.

489
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:17,835
I've got to download.

490
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:19,169
What?

491
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,704
I've got to take a shit.

492
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,173
Download?

493
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,343
Yeah, it's
those balls you gave me.

494
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:27,611
Ah Mozartkugel.

495
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:29,546
Yeah.

496
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:31,982
You've got to
download some Mozart.

497
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,352
Just stop talking.

498
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:38,689
Drop some cards.

499
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,053
Do you feel better?

500
00:28:09,055 --> 00:28:10,287
We'll see.

501
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,122
I got you a
large Pepto-Bismol,

502
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:14,058
three diet 7-ups a
dark chocolate brownie

503
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,325
and a chicken noodle soup.

504
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:18,395
Noted and appreciated.

505
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:19,630
And also I want to buy you

506
00:28:19,632 --> 00:28:20,864
a pair of flip-flops.

507
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:22,266
Why?

508
00:28:22,268 --> 00:28:23,467
Well I figured you're moving

509
00:28:23,469 --> 00:28:25,936
to Los Angeles and
it is very convenient

510
00:28:25,938 --> 00:28:28,405
on your foot. It's good
so which one you like?

511
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,807
What's your size?

512
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:31,075
Um, I don't know.

513
00:28:31,077 --> 00:28:32,918
It depends you
know. On the shoe.

514
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:34,278
Let me see.

515
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:38,782
That's good.

516
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,284
You don't want to try them on?

517
00:28:40,286 --> 00:28:41,051
No, no, no it's all right.

518
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:41,985
I can tell.

519
00:28:41,987 --> 00:28:43,287
Just try it on.

520
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:44,610
I don't want to try them on.

521
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:45,923
You don't want to try them on?

522
00:28:45,925 --> 00:28:46,890
Don't ask me the question I

523
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,158
just answered.

524
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,860
You will be safer
if you try them on.

525
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,029
I mean just to make
sure because this

526
00:28:52,031 --> 00:28:53,964
is unlikely the place
you would return to

527
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:55,399
for an exchange in
case you find out

528
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:56,333
they don't fit.

529
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:57,601
Forget it.

530
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:00,537
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

531
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:02,659
No problem. Just tell
me which one you like.

532
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,508
I don't give a fuck as long as

533
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,709
they're not pink.

534
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:07,611
Okay. Which ones are pink?

535
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:10,781
Are you kidding me?

536
00:29:10,783 --> 00:29:12,149
What?

537
00:29:12,151 --> 00:29:14,051
I thought that
was an act back there

538
00:29:14,053 --> 00:29:14,885
with the cop.

539
00:29:14,887 --> 00:29:15,819
An act?

540
00:29:15,821 --> 00:29:16,620
The cop.

541
00:29:16,622 --> 00:29:17,955
No. No.

542
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:20,958
I was telling the truth.
I'm really Daltonic.

543
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,094
Get the fuck out of here.

544
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:31,168
Damn.

545
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,836
I can't even get
a driver's license.

546
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,219
What color are your shoes?

547
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:38,942
Gray.

548
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:41,912
Gray like everything else.

549
00:29:41,914 --> 00:29:43,147
You hungry?

550
00:29:43,149 --> 00:29:44,581
I could eat a stuffed camel.

551
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,283
What?

552
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:47,217
That's officially
the biggest meat

553
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:48,218
in the world.

554
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:49,253
I didn't say let's get

555
00:29:49,255 --> 00:29:50,187
genocidal on our stomachs.

556
00:29:50,189 --> 00:29:50,821
I just figured we should go get

557
00:29:50,823 --> 00:29:51,822
some grub.

558
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:53,590
It's stuffed with goats

559
00:29:53,592 --> 00:29:54,792
and beef.

560
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,598
You know, I thought
about it a lot.

561
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,203
And you know maybe this
is the way the world

562
00:30:06,205 --> 00:30:07,471
was meant to be seen.

563
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:11,542
I mean like me, I
mean the way I see it.

564
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,177
That's hardly the case.

565
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,645
I mean you know most
people see colors.

566
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:22,431
You're kind of like a
glitch in the system.

567
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:25,889
Like young republicans
or underhung black guys.

568
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:32,329
So, what else do
you do to distract

569
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:34,371
yourself when you're
not at the post office?

570
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:35,866
I play bass.

571
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:37,501
How's that going?

572
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:38,569
Oh, very fine.

573
00:30:38,571 --> 00:30:39,937
I'm in a band.

574
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:41,338
Got a name?

575
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,272
Sisyphus.

576
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:44,408
Sisyphus?

577
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,743
Yeah, we make Sisyphus rock.

578
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:48,979
Sisyphus?

579
00:30:48,981 --> 00:30:51,248
Sisyphus, you
know the guy who was

580
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:54,418
condemned by the gods
to forever roll a

581
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:57,621
rock to the top of the
mountain where the rock

582
00:30:57,623 --> 00:30:59,523
would then fall back
of its own weight and

583
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:00,858
roll back down.

584
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:04,194
I guess they thought
there's no more dreadful

585
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:07,464
punishment than futile
and hopeless labor.

586
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,199
Sisyphus.

587
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,834
I named it.

588
00:31:10,836 --> 00:31:12,636
After a futile
laborer of the underworld.

589
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:18,575
Camus said that,
"One always finds one's

590
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:21,712
burden again," and that
the struggle itself

591
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:25,515
towards the heights is
enough to fill a man's heart.

592
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,851
One must imagine Sisyphus happy.

593
00:31:27,853 --> 00:31:29,174
I'm sure he's having a ball.

594
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,689
So where do you guys play?

595
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:35,125
On the weekends we play at

596
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:36,159
and.

597
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:37,895
Is that a club?

598
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,697
An intersection, very busy.

599
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,109
We recorded a couple of demos.

600
00:31:52,111 --> 00:31:54,311
It's not the best
quality, but all

601
00:31:54,313 --> 00:31:55,746
of our friends seem to like it.

602
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,815
Yeah, but that's
like deaf and dumb

603
00:31:58,817 --> 00:32:00,851
parents applauding
their retarded kids.

604
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:01,786
You know?

605
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:04,054
Hm.

606
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,657
Do you want to hear
some Blonde Priest?

607
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,294
Sure, why not.

608
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:34,839
Is that how you get down?

609
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:36,253
Huh?

610
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:38,542
Is that how you dance to it?

611
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:42,426
What do you think?

612
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:15,726
We've got to go.

613
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,194
I've got to bounce.

614
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:20,564
No, no, no,
no. I've got it.

615
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:22,165
I got it.

616
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:33,944
All right. So
this is all residential,

617
00:33:33,946 --> 00:33:35,145
which means there's
no traffic lights,

618
00:33:35,147 --> 00:33:37,107
but you've got to
look out for the kids.

619
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:41,251
Can you drive?

620
00:33:41,253 --> 00:33:43,020
Woooo!

621
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,921
Right, right keep it straight.

622
00:33:44,923 --> 00:33:45,689
Keep it straight.

623
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:47,190
This is super.

624
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:48,725
Yeah, but you've
got to do it right though.

625
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:49,826
Hold on a second.

626
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:54,064
Like that.

627
00:33:54,066 --> 00:33:55,346
Now take this hand
off the wheel.

628
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:56,967
There you go. That's
called dipping.

629
00:33:56,969 --> 00:33:57,934
Dipping?

630
00:33:57,936 --> 00:33:59,036
Yeah, dipping -

631
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,337
Dipping and tripping.

632
00:34:00,339 --> 00:34:01,104
You know what I'm saying?

633
00:34:01,106 --> 00:34:02,039
I'm dipping.

634
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:02,939
Yeah, you're dipping.

635
00:34:04,143 --> 00:34:05,409
We've got to bump
some shit though.

636
00:34:05,411 --> 00:34:06,376
I have some good shit in here

637
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:10,714
like one of those shits.

638
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:12,249
Okay.

639
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:22,059
No, no, no that's not working.

640
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:28,732
Let's try some of this.

641
00:34:33,072 --> 00:34:34,905
There you go. Now
you're gangster.

642
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:36,973
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

643
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,444
Yeah, okay don't do that.

644
00:34:40,446 --> 00:34:41,545
That's not gangster.

645
00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:43,180
True that. True that.

646
00:34:43,182 --> 00:34:44,622
Okay don't let go of the wheel.

647
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:48,485
Let's trip up
some white people.

648
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,253
Yeah, you do that.

649
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,423
More beat.

650
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:58,128
Make it bounce.

651
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,530
Yeah it's not that kind of car.

652
00:34:59,531 --> 00:35:00,497
We need to make this
right. Okay nice and slow.

653
00:35:00,499 --> 00:35:01,531
I got it. I got it.

654
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:02,899
Just tell me when it's green.

655
00:35:02,901 --> 00:35:04,968
Go ahead and
make this right turn.

656
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:06,910
Careful watch out for the car.

657
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:10,173
Slowly.

658
00:35:12,743 --> 00:35:14,878
All right keep it
straight. Keep it straight.

659
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:17,147
You want to make the
next right before

660
00:35:17,149 --> 00:35:18,109
the intersection.

661
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:21,885
Fuck, there's a bus behind you.

662
00:35:21,887 --> 00:35:23,153
Just pull over. Pull over.

663
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,321
Mexicans!

664
00:35:24,323 --> 00:35:24,955
Pull over.

665
00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:26,523
Pull over! Pull over!

666
00:35:26,525 --> 00:35:27,324
Stop! Stop! Stop!

667
00:35:27,326 --> 00:35:28,407
Brakes, brakes, brakes!

668
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,864
What the fuck was that?

669
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:35,432
I'm sorry.

670
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:45,575
We missed the bus.

671
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:46,710
Sorry guys.

672
00:35:46,712 --> 00:35:47,611
I'm so sorry.

673
00:35:47,613 --> 00:35:48,778
He had interview.

674
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:49,980
When's the next bus?

675
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:50,680
For the job.

676
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:51,481
When?

677
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:52,616
With the manager.

678
00:35:52,618 --> 00:35:53,917
She got excited
seeing Mexicans.

679
00:35:53,919 --> 00:35:55,280
Oh, we are from El Salvador.

680
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:57,654
Same -

681
00:35:58,656 --> 00:35:59,623
Shit.

682
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:02,859
Shit, yes. Same, no.

683
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:05,595
Listen, I'm
sure there's a bus every

684
00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:06,596
15 minutes.

685
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:08,231
Can we give him a ride?

686
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:10,033
Where do you need to be?

687
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,768
The Hotel Sheraton.

688
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:14,804
The Sheraton? That's
really out of the way,

689
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:17,474
but I can get you guys there.

690
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,809
Can you fit in the back.

691
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:21,478
Sure, sure amigo.

692
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,679
I can fit my whole family.

693
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,247
My name is Regis.

694
00:36:24,249 --> 00:36:25,582
This is my son Oswaldinho.

695
00:36:25,584 --> 00:36:27,551
He's the best. He's
like me. The best.

696
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:30,287
Oswaldinho, he was away
for a couple of years.

697
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,156
He was at the university.

698
00:36:33,158 --> 00:36:34,558
What did you study?

699
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,326
Oh, he don't
like to talk too much.

700
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,930
He, how you say a deep
thinker, like his madre.

701
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:41,565
You know kids now a days.

702
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:44,334
He make some mistakes,
but now he's back

703
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:47,737
and he has a little nina.

704
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:48,738
Your girlfriend?

705
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,207
Oh, no, no. Es su bebé.

706
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:52,075
Yeah. I have the picture.

707
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:55,879
Oh, look at the baby.

708
00:36:56,914 --> 00:36:58,682
Yes, she is very cute

709
00:36:58,684 --> 00:36:59,983
and very quiet too.

710
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:01,885
Varnie, look at the baby.

711
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,255
Yes, he is going
to have another baby.

712
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:07,190
His wife gordita.

713
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:08,458
Really?

714
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,293
Oh yes. She is the best.

715
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:11,995
Funf.

716
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:18,335
I'd like three
kids. One of each.

717
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,439
Yes, well you know Oswaldinho,

718
00:37:22,441 --> 00:37:24,307
he had to get a job first.

719
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:29,246
He can become the
valet or maybe he

720
00:37:29,248 --> 00:37:33,250
can go into the kitchen
and help the chef

721
00:37:33,252 --> 00:37:36,886
with the dishes and
then maybe he can

722
00:37:36,888 --> 00:37:40,323
become the engineer
or maybe even the

723
00:37:40,325 --> 00:37:45,729
chief engineer and
then maybe one day

724
00:37:45,731 --> 00:37:46,930
the manager.

725
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:51,468
So what do you do Senor Varnie?

726
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:53,770
I'm a designer.

727
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:55,238
Really?

728
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,473
Yes.

729
00:37:56,607 --> 00:38:01,111
He is the best. He
make a lot of money.

730
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:03,179
What about you Regis?

731
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:05,548
Me I am the engineer.

732
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,617
My husband is the engineer.

733
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:11,488
I start as the
valet and then I get

734
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:16,326
the tips and then I got
the tools, then the pass

735
00:38:16,328 --> 00:38:18,061
key and everything.

736
00:38:18,063 --> 00:38:19,296
I am the best.

737
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:21,131
The call to me on the radio.

738
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:23,767
They say, "Senor
Regis code one."

739
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:27,103
I call back and I
say, "10-4," like the

740
00:38:27,105 --> 00:38:32,409
general then I go
and I fix the toilet.

741
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:36,413
They used to call
it the code brown,

742
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:39,382
but then they
decided to change it.

743
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,022
What is it that you design?

744
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:53,563
Brands.

745
00:38:53,565 --> 00:38:55,465
Why brands? How
do you go about it?

746
00:38:57,368 --> 00:39:00,337
Well, you know
brands set the tone.

747
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:03,206
I mean if you go to a
museum and see some art

748
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:04,708
the vast majority of
people are going to

749
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,176
look at the little title card
with the artist's name on it

750
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:07,979
before they ever pay
attention to the painting

751
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:09,479
that's in front of it.

752
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:12,082
I like expressionists
and the wonderful

753
00:39:12,084 --> 00:39:13,717
ways they apply gray.

754
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:15,318
That's where I come in.

755
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:17,120
With an already built up brand,

756
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:18,822
a productless brand,
a brand you could just

757
00:39:18,824 --> 00:39:20,957
attach your product
to, any product and

758
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:23,259
like that their friends.

759
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:24,694
Why?

760
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:25,895
Because they've got the
following the brand came with

761
00:39:25,897 --> 00:39:27,897
because see people have
always heard of it.

762
00:39:28,265 --> 00:39:30,225
They just didn't know
what it stood for.

763
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:32,802
Anything I might know about?

764
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,372
Well if you've ever heard of.

765
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:37,674
I regret that's not

766
00:39:37,676 --> 00:39:39,175
too familiar.

767
00:39:39,177 --> 00:39:41,010
Well, I sold that
one to a perfum company

768
00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:41,978
in the bay area.

769
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:43,346
Wow.

770
00:39:43,348 --> 00:39:44,114
Right? Yeah,
I had the whole

771
00:39:44,116 --> 00:39:45,148
production going on.

772
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,082
Check this out.

773
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,392
Wow.

774
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,927
And those are
a bunch of web sites,

775
00:39:57,929 --> 00:39:59,129
a bunch of web sites.

776
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:02,298
Crappyfathersdaygift.com.

777
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:06,236
I've got a novel,
an idea a preface, a

778
00:40:06,238 --> 00:40:07,404
cover design.

779
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:09,439
Someone just needs to write it.

780
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:12,108
That's why I'm moving to
LA to snag some investors.

781
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,077
I've got a fucking movie.

782
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:16,613
Daniel Craig
starring as Vladimir Putin.

783
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:18,281
Yeah. The mad Russian.

784
00:40:18,283 --> 00:40:19,449
Wow.

785
00:40:19,683 --> 00:40:20,683
So the whole world can feel

786
00:40:20,685 --> 00:40:21,651
my truth.

787
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:23,720
Are you on Facebook?

788
00:40:23,722 --> 00:40:24,587
Fuck no.

789
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:29,192
Ooh. What's this?

790
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,060
Oh, that's an old Russian

791
00:40:31,062 --> 00:40:35,432
aircraft carrier converted
into a hotel/brothel/casino.

792
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,901
I want to apply
for a job there.

793
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,782
But again that
could be anything really.

794
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:43,239
Dude, you are a genius.

795
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:45,442
But I'm broke
and there's a lot of

796
00:40:45,444 --> 00:40:46,943
idiots out there making bank.

797
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:48,945
Like Ben Stiller.

798
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:50,213
Yeah give me
YouTube, some radio time,

799
00:40:50,215 --> 00:40:52,048
billboards and I can
fill up a sports arena

800
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,384
with an audience ready
for a concert for a band

801
00:40:54,386 --> 00:40:55,752
that doesn't even exist.

802
00:40:55,754 --> 00:40:56,820
Fuck, I'd go.

803
00:40:56,822 --> 00:40:57,554
Right.

804
00:40:58,389 --> 00:40:59,389
Funf!

805
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:00,523
What?

806
00:41:00,525 --> 00:41:01,791
Funf.

807
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,060
I don't know
if you're trying to

808
00:41:04,062 --> 00:41:05,195
salute the furor or
give me a high five.

809
00:41:05,197 --> 00:41:06,296
Yes five, funf.

810
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,364
Funf.

811
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:15,586
I'm not going to
debate you, Nena.

812
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:17,679
Hipsters are not
saving the world.

813
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,372
Fucking mincing around.

814
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:26,495
You see that little
club right there?

815
00:42:26,777 --> 00:42:27,810
Chill spot right?

816
00:42:28,812 --> 00:42:30,213
Very fine indeed.

817
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:31,881
Yeah, well it's
very high on the DBS.

818
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,182
DBS?

819
00:42:33,184 --> 00:42:34,517
Douche bag scale.

820
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:36,152
Douche bag scale?

821
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:37,687
Yeah, I mean look at the facial

822
00:42:37,689 --> 00:42:39,609
expressions, look
at their clothes.

823
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:41,457
Looks at those
jeans for God sakes.

824
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:42,859
What is that shit?

825
00:42:42,861 --> 00:42:44,702
You fart you blow
your shoes off.

826
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:47,096
Do you feel diminished by

827
00:42:47,098 --> 00:42:48,331
their shortcomings?

828
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:49,599
What?

829
00:42:49,601 --> 00:42:51,568
What else bothers you about LA?

830
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:54,971
Bikers, joggers, Armenian

831
00:42:54,973 --> 00:42:56,639
cab drivers, veggie
juice, Persians, cops,

832
00:42:56,641 --> 00:43:00,243
traffic, bums, TV
producers who wear Crocs,

833
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:02,325
Mexicans who don't speak
any fucking English,

834
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:04,614
unemployed actors, all
those frozen yogurt places,

835
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:07,250
bums. What about yourself?

836
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:09,786
This is my first time here.

837
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:11,888
I mean in general.

838
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:12,855
What's the one
thing to date that's

839
00:43:12,857 --> 00:43:14,057
disappointed you the most?

840
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:17,293
The fall of Troy.

841
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:37,180
Do you have a girlfriend?

842
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:39,282
I go to some games but I'm

843
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:40,516
not a season ticket holder.

844
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:42,652
I see.

845
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:46,522
I kind of look
at myself like a sailor

846
00:43:46,524 --> 00:43:48,424
who's left one shore
but hasn't quite

847
00:43:48,426 --> 00:43:49,792
reached the other one.

848
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:51,060
You know what I mean?

849
00:43:51,062 --> 00:43:54,297
I mean it's like the
original ideas that

850
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:56,699
before I drop an anchor,
settle down I mean,

851
00:43:57,334 --> 00:43:59,214
I've got to spread
my wings first.

852
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:02,572
Set aside some dough,
enough to buy freedom.

853
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:04,574
Then I'd go to Philadelphia.

854
00:44:04,576 --> 00:44:05,842
Why Philadelphia?

855
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:07,977
Because I
always wanted to climb

856
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:09,679
those rocky steps. You know?

857
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:14,484
Get to the top, flex,
then I'd take a year off,

858
00:44:14,486 --> 00:44:17,020
travel, visit every
country, stop in every bar

859
00:44:17,022 --> 00:44:21,124
and have a drink, then fuck
a girl in each country.

860
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:26,462
That way I could see
the world and fuck it.

861
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:29,565
That's what's up.

862
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:55,458
You know? Most dreams

863
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,862
are spawned as an issue really.

864
00:45:01,165 --> 00:45:05,501
Some sort of complex
developed at an early age

865
00:45:05,503 --> 00:45:07,937
and now you've got
a knot sitting in

866
00:45:07,939 --> 00:45:11,574
your stomach like
a harpooned seal

867
00:45:11,576 --> 00:45:13,509
waiting for its grand showdown

868
00:45:13,511 --> 00:45:14,844
with the world.

869
00:45:14,846 --> 00:45:19,082
It throbs underneath
your skin like a lost

870
00:45:19,084 --> 00:45:22,552
and captured moth beating
away against the glass

871
00:45:22,554 --> 00:45:25,254
over and over again,
but you see it's only

872
00:45:25,256 --> 00:45:28,524
when we part from it that
we grow, only when we

873
00:45:28,526 --> 00:45:30,893
abandon our plan A and
try to make something

874
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:33,896
out of plan B or
C or D, you know.

875
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:36,365
What do we get there?

876
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:41,070
I mean.
You know?

877
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:43,906
What's along the roadside.

878
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,750
I'm not sure I'll ever stop

879
00:45:53,752 --> 00:45:55,718
wondering about
girls who pass by.

880
00:45:57,154 --> 00:45:58,321
You know the ones
you see for only

881
00:45:58,323 --> 00:46:01,424
about a couple of
seconds walking down

882
00:46:01,426 --> 00:46:05,094
the street, sitting in
a car at a red light,

883
00:46:05,662 --> 00:46:07,622
playing with their
phones in a cafe.

884
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:11,701
It's for those couple of
seconds that your eyes

885
00:46:11,703 --> 00:46:14,904
beg you to let you
steal more of her.

886
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:19,575
I fall in love maybe 15
times a day on average

887
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:23,246
and it's those girls, I
believe, are all we'll

888
00:46:23,248 --> 00:46:26,783
ever know about true
love on this earth,

889
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:28,818
in this life.

890
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:34,657
We are the
creatures of appetite.

891
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:38,127
You like chicken?

892
00:46:38,695 --> 00:46:41,464
Yeah. I love chicken.

893
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:44,379
Until I was 12 I
thought they could fly.

894
00:46:45,435 --> 00:46:46,602
My cousin used to
refer to me as a

895
00:46:46,604 --> 00:46:48,070
fat little chicken.

896
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:49,872
I also became a
member of an animal

897
00:46:49,874 --> 00:46:51,641
right group called
Kentucky Free Chicken

898
00:46:51,643 --> 00:46:56,212
but it turned out to
be a fake, a scam.

899
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,713
Is that right?

900
00:46:57,981 --> 00:46:59,941
Well I'm taking you
to Cousin Cliff's.

901
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:01,217
Yeah. Cousin
Cliff is good.

902
00:47:01,219 --> 00:47:03,553
I ate there before. They
have one in Germany.

903
00:47:04,855 --> 00:47:06,375
I'll be sure
to let him know that.

904
00:47:53,237 --> 00:47:54,136
Vicious!

905
00:47:54,138 --> 00:47:55,438
What's up cuz?

906
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:57,961
You could have
parked in the rear.

907
00:47:58,075 --> 00:47:59,475
Oh, that's
fine. That's fine.

908
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,177
Who is this?

909
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:02,712
Hi. I'm Nena.

910
00:48:03,647 --> 00:48:06,449
Nena. Like
the band right?

911
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:09,051
Yes!

912
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:10,353
You know Nena?

913
00:48:10,355 --> 00:48:12,156
Yes, I fucked the
shit out of the drummer.

914
00:48:16,593 --> 00:48:18,553
I think religion is
making a comeback.

915
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:21,964
The internet, Facebook, Twitter.

916
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:26,535
Even the fucking Pope
is going like that shit,

917
00:48:26,537 --> 00:48:27,837
follow that.

918
00:48:28,038 --> 00:48:29,906
My dear friend Caspian
made a trip to New York

919
00:48:29,908 --> 00:48:31,974
to see this shaman who
was telling him about

920
00:48:31,976 --> 00:48:34,844
Jainism, which preaches
that there are 30

921
00:48:34,846 --> 00:48:38,047
heavens and seven hells
layered throughout our lives.

922
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,616
He was going to teach
him how to fly through

923
00:48:40,618 --> 00:48:45,421
spheres and hear
cosmic bells and shit.

924
00:48:45,423 --> 00:48:46,656
Then he told him
which forms to fill out.

925
00:48:46,658 --> 00:48:47,924
I'm serious.

926
00:48:47,926 --> 00:48:50,026
Actually Blonde
Priest is just a name

927
00:48:50,028 --> 00:48:51,060
of the band.

928
00:48:51,795 --> 00:48:52,929
It's a band.

929
00:48:52,931 --> 00:48:54,063
Is it a German band?

930
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:55,898
American actually.

931
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,668
Most of the time it's
just one guy with a guitar

932
00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:01,470
and the name Priest
comes from an old

933
00:49:01,472 --> 00:49:05,107
theory that a good joke
is like a disguised priest

934
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:08,210
that weds every couple,
especially couples

935
00:49:08,212 --> 00:49:09,912
whose relatives disapprove.

936
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:11,447
I'll drink to that.

937
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:13,282
I'm not even baptized.

938
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:15,017
I was told that when
they tried to baptize

939
00:49:15,019 --> 00:49:17,987
me when I was a kid I took
a shit in priest's hands.

940
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:21,490
Well let me
tell you something girl

941
00:49:21,492 --> 00:49:24,493
you missing out because
as one of my clients says,

942
00:49:24,495 --> 00:49:27,596
"Thank God I was
raised Catholic because

943
00:49:27,598 --> 00:49:30,266
sex will always be dirty."

944
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:34,503
Well there's some -

945
00:49:34,505 --> 00:49:36,025
You know what
the new religion is?

946
00:49:36,573 --> 00:49:40,476
Green, environmentally friendly,
organic shit, recycling.

947
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:42,244
Just ignore him.

948
00:49:42,746 --> 00:49:45,748
What if you
do everything right,

949
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:48,451
you die and you go to
heaven, you get there

950
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:51,526
and there's a little
old Christian lady,

951
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:54,557
a three-legged
dog and that's it.

952
00:50:01,064 --> 00:50:03,132
Their songs are
like sex you know?

953
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:08,337
They start very shy and
then the melody slides

954
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:12,341
in and it's like...
it stirs your heart.

955
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:45,274
Making the light
burst all over us all

956
00:50:45,276 --> 00:50:48,611
and you just want to play
it again, over and over

957
00:50:48,613 --> 00:50:49,678
and over again.

958
00:50:50,882 --> 00:50:51,947
Then you get sick of it and you

959
00:50:51,949 --> 00:50:53,070
have to find a new song.

960
00:50:57,687 --> 00:50:59,155
Thanks love.

961
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:02,792
Put your hair down you look
like a fucking samurai.

962
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:07,030
What's with this banging shit?

963
00:51:07,031 --> 00:51:08,497
That's Miyoko's boy.

964
00:51:08,865 --> 00:51:12,034
He's 14 I swear to God
he's like tossing it

965
00:51:12,036 --> 00:51:14,670
six times a day at least.

966
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:16,739
I didn't know she had a kid.

967
00:51:16,741 --> 00:51:18,661
He's lost like 35
pounds since they've been here.

968
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:20,276
Bless her offspring.

969
00:51:20,877 --> 00:51:21,710
If I had known I would have

970
00:51:21,712 --> 00:51:22,793
brought him something.

971
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,180
A pogostick.

972
00:51:24,182 --> 00:51:26,916
He makes it
seem like he's working

973
00:51:26,918 --> 00:51:29,685
on a science project,
building some shit.

974
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,954
You know he's from
Mongolia and they lived

975
00:51:31,956 --> 00:51:33,289
in a circular tent.

976
00:51:33,291 --> 00:51:34,590
A yurt!

977
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:36,625
Even his mom,
she sometimes picks up

978
00:51:36,627 --> 00:51:39,728
a brush and start
painting compulsively.

979
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:44,934
Sick shit like pigeons
rolled up in newspaper.

980
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:48,003
Then she starts
singing Abba songs.

981
00:51:51,576 --> 00:51:53,843
Pugs liked billboards. Yes.

982
00:51:54,911 --> 00:51:56,212
Poor pugs.

983
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:00,416
He was my dog,
Pugsley. He passed.

984
00:52:03,353 --> 00:52:05,754
Someone put poison
in his coffee.

985
00:52:06,089 --> 00:52:06,989
Fuck them.

986
00:52:06,991 --> 00:52:08,157
Your dog drank coffee?

987
00:52:08,558 --> 00:52:10,793
Coffee, whiskey, vodka.

988
00:52:11,828 --> 00:52:13,195
Pugsley was the shit.

989
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:16,532
He was raped by a
pitbull and had his

990
00:52:16,534 --> 00:52:20,202
balls bitten off by a
yorkie but not once,

991
00:52:20,204 --> 00:52:22,671
never gave up.

992
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:26,775
I used to ride around
all over town looking

993
00:52:26,777 --> 00:52:28,744
for the best deal on cremation.

994
00:52:29,446 --> 00:52:31,113
Them fuckers.

995
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:32,915
Robbery.

996
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:35,084
This one place was asking $1500.

997
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:36,752
Fuck them.

998
00:52:36,754 --> 00:52:38,287
I was like sweetie is this some

999
00:52:38,289 --> 00:52:41,056
sort of deal? Like can
I get a two for one?

1000
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:44,527
That's so niggardly.

1001
00:52:45,195 --> 00:52:46,228
What?

1002
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:47,730
I think it's great.

1003
00:52:48,098 --> 00:52:49,331
What?

1004
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,001
I am very niggardly myself.

1005
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:54,157
What are you talking about?

1006
00:52:54,905 --> 00:52:57,039
It means being
able to find a bargain.

1007
00:52:57,474 --> 00:52:58,941
Some people call it cheap,

1008
00:52:58,943 --> 00:53:01,243
but I like it buying
shirts at the gas station

1009
00:53:01,245 --> 00:53:03,179
or eating strictly
at restaurants

1010
00:53:03,181 --> 00:53:05,881
that has pictures
of food on the menu.

1011
00:53:06,616 --> 00:53:07,616
What?

1012
00:53:07,618 --> 00:53:09,118
Niggardly.

1013
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,880
Sweetie, where did
you learn your English?

1014
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:12,321
Woody Allen movies.

1015
00:53:12,323 --> 00:53:16,692
Many words like
adventitious, hebetudinous.

1016
00:53:17,294 --> 00:53:19,962
My aunt got the custody
of her ex-husband's

1017
00:53:19,964 --> 00:53:21,397
collection when he left her.

1018
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:24,833
He used to manage a
local cinematic and

1019
00:53:24,835 --> 00:53:26,402
was quite a Woody fan.

1020
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:29,371
Is Woody still
married to his daughter?

1021
00:53:29,606 --> 00:53:31,640
She's not his daughter.

1022
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:34,310
You see his ex-girlfriend's
adopted daughter

1023
00:53:34,312 --> 00:53:35,945
whom he never fathered.

1024
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:37,646
Don't listen to her Cliff.

1025
00:53:37,648 --> 00:53:38,614
She'll make genocide
sound like a really

1026
00:53:38,616 --> 00:53:39,915
good idea.

1027
00:53:39,917 --> 00:53:42,651
And I think it's
beautiful and brave

1028
00:53:42,653 --> 00:53:44,053
because he could have picked any

1029
00:53:44,055 --> 00:53:46,188
prepossessing little
waitress who wants

1030
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:48,624
to make it in the movies,
but no he went out

1031
00:53:48,626 --> 00:53:49,925
on the brink.

1032
00:53:50,193 --> 00:53:52,728
He took the blows from
the public because,

1033
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:53,896
you know?

1034
00:53:53,898 --> 00:53:55,698
The heart wants what it wants.

1035
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:56,632
Yeah.

1036
00:53:56,634 --> 00:53:58,167
I hate that phrase.

1037
00:53:58,169 --> 00:53:59,501
It's like the woman who
had a baby when she was 63

1038
00:53:59,503 --> 00:54:01,170
but couldn't breastfeed
because her arms were

1039
00:54:01,172 --> 00:54:02,204
too short.

1040
00:54:03,341 --> 00:54:04,206
Cop, cop, cop, cop.

1041
00:54:04,208 --> 00:54:05,140
Ah fuck.

1042
00:54:05,142 --> 00:54:06,308
Oh I was with a cop once.

1043
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:07,610
I can't fucking believe this.

1044
00:54:07,612 --> 00:54:10,346
He was so young
and funny. So buff.

1045
00:54:10,348 --> 00:54:11,347
Okay. Calm down.

1046
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:14,083
But he was short as shit.

1047
00:54:26,696 --> 00:54:28,631
Sir, please take
the key out of the ignition

1048
00:54:28,633 --> 00:54:29,898
and throw it on the street.

1049
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,001
Nice and slow.

1050
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:37,113
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

1051
00:54:38,675 --> 00:54:42,077
Are you aware that you were
driving with a taillight out?

1052
00:54:44,347 --> 00:54:45,614
No. I mean what?
How would you even know -

1053
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:46,915
Could you please
describe for me exactly

1054
00:54:46,917 --> 00:54:48,837
the last car you
saw in front of you.

1055
00:54:51,054 --> 00:54:52,454
It was a Toyota.

1056
00:54:52,555 --> 00:54:54,290
Corolla?

1057
00:54:54,292 --> 00:54:55,257
Sure, I guess.

1058
00:54:55,259 --> 00:54:56,058
Pretty beat up?

1059
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:57,426
It seemed new.

1060
00:54:58,094 --> 00:54:59,295
Light blue, silverish?

1061
00:55:00,096 --> 00:55:00,996
It was black.

1062
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:02,331
That was him.

1063
00:55:02,333 --> 00:55:03,499
Who?

1064
00:55:03,501 --> 00:55:04,901
You have any drugs in the car?

1065
00:55:05,101 --> 00:55:06,201
No.

1066
00:55:07,203 --> 00:55:08,270
What's your name?

1067
00:55:09,606 --> 00:55:10,906
Cliff.

1068
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:12,074
Yeah? Cliff,
why don't you step out

1069
00:55:12,076 --> 00:55:13,208
onto the sidewalk for me, huh?

1070
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:14,243
Why?

1071
00:55:14,245 --> 00:55:15,210
Come on.

1072
00:55:15,712 --> 00:55:16,752
Out of the car Cliff.

1073
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:18,547
Yo, what is this shit?

1074
00:55:18,682 --> 00:55:20,282
You! Turn around!

1075
00:55:22,018 --> 00:55:23,385
No one should see your face.

1076
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,587
On the hood Cliff. Come on.

1077
00:55:28,224 --> 00:55:29,325
You got anything
on you I'm going to

1078
00:55:29,327 --> 00:55:30,448
stick myself with Cliff?

1079
00:55:31,429 --> 00:55:32,328
No.

1080
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:32,961
You packing any heat?

1081
00:55:32,963 --> 00:55:34,196
What?

1082
00:55:34,198 --> 00:55:35,097
You got a gun on you Cliff?

1083
00:55:35,099 --> 00:55:36,365
Straps, anything like that?

1084
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:37,733
No.

1085
00:55:37,735 --> 00:55:38,834
You got a blow gun?

1086
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:39,735
What?

1087
00:55:41,438 --> 00:55:42,404
No?

1088
00:55:45,141 --> 00:55:46,542
What the fuck?

1089
00:55:48,378 --> 00:55:49,478
Keep walking lady.

1090
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:52,548
Keep walking.

1091
00:55:54,984 --> 00:55:58,120
Tell me Cliff, why
is it Asian babies

1092
00:55:58,122 --> 00:55:59,621
always look so confused?

1093
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,156
Huh?

1094
00:56:01,558 --> 00:56:02,791
You all right?

1095
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:04,693
Why you walking
around with a cucumber

1096
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:06,856
in your pocket while the
world's falling apart?

1097
00:56:07,263 --> 00:56:08,530
Well I -

1098
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:11,900
I use it for gin and tonics.

1099
00:56:13,002 --> 00:56:15,003
For a relaxing
time, making it a

1100
00:56:15,005 --> 00:56:16,438
time.

1101
00:56:17,107 --> 00:56:18,374
Am I right?

1102
00:56:18,675 --> 00:56:19,541
It's either that or
you're whacking off

1103
00:56:19,543 --> 00:56:20,809
in the closet.

1104
00:56:20,811 --> 00:56:21,610
Do you know what the best part

1105
00:56:21,612 --> 00:56:22,745
about masturbation is?

1106
00:56:22,946 --> 00:56:24,113
No.

1107
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:28,484
It's the cuddling afterwards.

1108
00:56:29,387 --> 00:56:30,152
What's that?

1109
00:56:30,154 --> 00:56:31,286
Woody Allen.

1110
00:56:31,288 --> 00:56:32,321
What?

1111
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:33,822
It's a funny anecdotal.

1112
00:56:34,023 --> 00:56:35,290
Where you from?

1113
00:56:35,292 --> 00:56:36,158
I'm from Berlin,
Germany but I live

1114
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,559
in Austria.

1115
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:39,241
How long you been
in the United States?

1116
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:40,696
For two days.

1117
00:56:40,997 --> 00:56:41,964
Yeah?

1118
00:56:43,767 --> 00:56:44,967
Show me how you suck a cock.

1119
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:47,636
Spit your gum out.

1120
00:56:47,638 --> 00:56:48,771
Spit your gum out
and show me with

1121
00:56:48,773 --> 00:56:50,272
your mouth how you suck a cock.

1122
00:56:50,274 --> 00:56:51,540
I'm not chewing gum.

1123
00:56:51,542 --> 00:56:52,941
Spit it out. Show
me how you suck a cock.

1124
00:56:52,943 --> 00:56:54,777
That's shit man.

1125
00:56:59,149 --> 00:57:00,315
I fucking knew it.

1126
00:57:00,317 --> 00:57:01,917
Whoa. Whoa.

1127
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:03,552
What's the deal here?

1128
00:57:04,154 --> 00:57:06,021
Mitts. Pleasure to
make your acquaintance.

1129
00:57:06,023 --> 00:57:06,855
How did I do?

1130
00:57:06,857 --> 00:57:08,157
How was that?

1131
00:57:08,159 --> 00:57:09,358
What the hell
is going on here Mitts?

1132
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,760
I'm an actor.
I'm in this play

1133
00:57:11,394 --> 00:57:13,796
and I play a cop. All right?

1134
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:17,466
And in the first part of the
play I arrest some people

1135
00:57:17,468 --> 00:57:19,201
and then five acts later
for about two minutes

1136
00:57:19,203 --> 00:57:21,403
I come back in and I
arrest some more people.

1137
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:23,372
The rest of the time I'm
just kind of walking around

1138
00:57:23,374 --> 00:57:25,607
on the streets bored.

1139
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:27,910
So, you figured
you would fuck with us?

1140
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:30,412
Fuck is such a
strong like negative -

1141
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:31,747
I don't -

1142
00:57:31,749 --> 00:57:32,915
It's more of an
energy that I exude.

1143
00:57:33,149 --> 00:57:34,650
You know?

1144
00:57:34,652 --> 00:57:38,287
I just try to act. That's
the dream, the passion.

1145
00:57:38,388 --> 00:57:39,621
You method motherfucker.

1146
00:57:39,623 --> 00:57:40,856
Exactly.

1147
00:57:40,858 --> 00:57:41,824
You guys want to
come check it out?

1148
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,358
It's pretty fucking awesome.

1149
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:45,461
This chick Angela shows
her tits at the end.

1150
00:57:45,463 --> 00:57:47,529
There's plenty of
seats. I'll get you in.

1151
00:57:48,064 --> 00:57:49,298
It's not a money thing.

1152
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:50,827
We have previous committments.

1153
00:57:52,168 --> 00:57:53,602
Little weird for a play though.

1154
00:57:53,604 --> 00:57:55,237
I'm not sure you would
like it, but I think

1155
00:57:55,239 --> 00:57:55,971
you might.

1156
00:57:55,973 --> 00:57:57,239
Check this out.

1157
00:57:58,074 --> 00:58:00,676
Cadillac, panda bear,
seven Belgian milk

1158
00:58:00,678 --> 00:58:02,511
peddlers sodomizing the panda.

1159
00:58:02,513 --> 00:58:05,013
I think it's
political, but I'm not

1160
00:58:05,015 --> 00:58:06,248
entirely sure.

1161
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:08,517
Sounds like a sublime piece.

1162
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:10,452
It's a little pervertito.

1163
00:58:10,454 --> 00:58:11,453
If you know what I mean.

1164
00:58:11,455 --> 00:58:12,654
You should take Miyoko.

1165
00:58:12,956 --> 00:58:14,189
Fucking weird if you don't.

1166
00:58:14,191 --> 00:58:15,190
We've got to go.

1167
00:58:15,592 --> 00:58:16,391
Where you going?

1168
00:58:16,393 --> 00:58:17,359
The party.

1169
00:58:17,794 --> 00:58:18,927
Can I come?

1170
00:58:19,095 --> 00:58:20,095
Fuck no.

1171
00:58:20,097 --> 00:58:21,230
You can take my jacket.

1172
00:58:21,232 --> 00:58:22,731
Yes, yes!

1173
00:58:22,733 --> 00:58:23,814
Are you fucking kidding me?

1174
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,267
It's Paco Rabanne.

1175
00:58:25,535 --> 00:58:26,702
Gay.

1176
00:58:26,704 --> 00:58:27,503
Wait, wait,
wait. Hold up.

1177
00:58:27,505 --> 00:58:28,403
What about your play?

1178
00:58:28,405 --> 00:58:29,371
Cliff, what the fuck man?

1179
00:58:29,373 --> 00:58:30,339
This is happening.

1180
00:58:30,341 --> 00:58:31,501
I'm making this happening.

1181
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:32,875
This is happening.

1182
00:58:32,877 --> 00:58:33,998
- He's tall.
- Let's do this.

1183
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:37,112
Yes Cliff, but I think
like a short man.

1184
00:58:39,782 --> 00:58:41,216
I was in a bunch
of deleted scenes

1185
00:58:41,218 --> 00:58:42,518
in the movie Limitless.

1186
00:58:42,752 --> 00:58:44,052
That's the one where
Bradley Cooper discovers

1187
00:58:44,054 --> 00:58:47,422
this clear little pill
and it allows him 100%

1188
00:58:47,424 --> 00:58:50,492
of his brain function
and basically he just

1189
00:58:50,494 --> 00:58:52,127
becomes Charlie Sheen.

1190
00:58:54,664 --> 00:58:57,566
I also had this one
commercial, but they wanted

1191
00:58:57,568 --> 00:58:59,001
me to wear like
an Ed Hardy shirt.

1192
00:58:59,135 --> 00:59:00,415
So I was just like, "Fuck that."

1193
00:59:08,344 --> 00:59:10,078
Did you ever notice that
an Acura symbol looks

1194
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,847
exactly like a pussy?

1195
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:15,450
It's just upside down.

1196
00:59:24,661 --> 00:59:25,794
That's silly.

1197
00:59:29,366 --> 00:59:31,767
German porn. That's all
I'm saying. Yah. Yah.

1198
00:59:32,602 --> 00:59:33,869
Oh!

1199
00:59:34,871 --> 00:59:36,471
Vicious, you
need to pitch to Frank.

1200
00:59:36,873 --> 00:59:39,708
He's got that gunslinger
mentality. Push, push, push.

1201
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:41,009
Make a deal. Make a deal.

1202
00:59:41,477 --> 00:59:43,078
Make a
deal. I'm about it.

1203
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,212
Oh, I'll be right back.

1204
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:45,480
I'm all over it.

1205
00:59:45,648 --> 00:59:47,316
You push. I'll deal.

1206
00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:49,704
Or you can deal.
Whatever you're feeling.

1207
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:50,679
You complete me.

1208
01:00:01,497 --> 01:00:02,998
Is that him?

1209
01:00:04,634 --> 01:00:06,314
What the fuck am
I smiling at him for then?

1210
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:07,502
Okay that was Armando.

1211
01:00:07,504 --> 01:00:08,804
He goes under Armand.

1212
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:10,978
He's in fashion, one
of them fashion guys.

1213
01:00:11,808 --> 01:00:16,411
He owns a store or
something, Toilet Tablet 2000

1214
01:00:16,413 --> 01:00:17,980
Flushes or some shit.

1215
01:00:18,581 --> 01:00:21,149
But fashion though.
He's a nice guy.

1216
01:00:22,051 --> 01:00:24,653
Fucking flamer. Nice though.

1217
01:00:26,523 --> 01:00:27,422
Got to look away from the lens.

1218
01:00:27,424 --> 01:00:28,657
Got to be aloof.

1219
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:31,693
You know I never know where

1220
01:00:31,695 --> 01:00:33,615
to look when I'm
eating a banana.

1221
01:00:34,498 --> 01:00:35,230
Crazy.

1222
01:00:35,232 --> 01:00:36,264
Where you been?

1223
01:00:36,266 --> 01:00:37,466
Oh, I was in the restroom.

1224
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:39,668
I was downloading.

1225
01:00:41,337 --> 01:00:43,405
You are such
a cute little person.

1226
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:47,609
You know Varnie
is also an artist.

1227
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:49,478
I think he's very brave.

1228
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,480
I'm going to browse.

1229
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:53,915
All right super star.

1230
01:00:54,851 --> 01:00:56,218
Don't give up that
gorgeous ass for under

1231
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:57,319
100 bucks.

1232
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:08,997
I will not!

1233
01:01:08,999 --> 01:01:10,519
Wait, he had
an ugly orgasm face?

1234
01:01:10,633 --> 01:01:11,967
Yeah, a weasel face.

1235
01:01:11,969 --> 01:01:13,902
Pointy mouth, squished face.

1236
01:01:13,904 --> 01:01:14,836
What?

1237
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:16,038
Oh, I've had worse.

1238
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:18,240
Lizard face, mouth wide,
fucking neck tendons

1239
01:01:18,242 --> 01:01:19,122
sticking out.

1240
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:22,177
Beaver face. Chin all
tucked in, buck teeth.

1241
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:23,945
Oh, wait monkey face.

1242
01:01:24,147 --> 01:01:26,148
Pursed lips.

1243
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:26,882
Ew.

1244
01:01:26,884 --> 01:01:28,183
Fucking ew.

1245
01:01:28,751 --> 01:01:30,831
So why do guys flex when
you touch their arm?

1246
01:01:31,554 --> 01:01:32,888
It's just there.

1247
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:33,922
Just there.

1248
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:37,793
Hey, what's up?

1249
01:01:38,561 --> 01:01:40,228
Just browsing you know?

1250
01:01:41,164 --> 01:01:42,464
Hey, you want to dance?

1251
01:01:42,632 --> 01:01:45,100
I'm kind of
networking right now.

1252
01:01:45,102 --> 01:01:45,834
So -

1253
01:01:45,968 --> 01:01:47,135
Cool.

1254
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:49,471
But it looks like I'm going

1255
01:01:49,473 --> 01:01:50,706
to leave soon.

1256
01:01:50,708 --> 01:01:51,940
I spoke with cousin
Cliff so you can

1257
01:01:51,942 --> 01:01:53,909
stay at his place
tonight, no problems.

1258
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:55,944
You can stay with those guys.

1259
01:01:56,179 --> 01:01:57,713
You can stay here
and hang with Mitts.

1260
01:01:58,114 --> 01:01:59,147
Is that cool?

1261
01:01:59,149 --> 01:02:01,183
Yeah. Yeah. No worries.

1262
01:02:01,818 --> 01:02:03,818
I'll show him how to
suck a guy's cock.

1263
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:10,826
He's actually a nice guy.

1264
01:02:10,828 --> 01:02:14,096
Bad actor, but nice guy.

1265
01:02:15,498 --> 01:02:17,999
All right. Cool.
I'll see you in the morning.

1266
01:02:18,334 --> 01:02:19,701
Cool. Cool.

1267
01:02:20,336 --> 01:02:21,269
You having fun?

1268
01:02:21,271 --> 01:02:22,771
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1269
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:24,673
There's a guy in
the corner playing

1270
01:02:24,675 --> 01:02:26,675
with a little train inside so -

1271
01:02:36,285 --> 01:02:37,686
Do they have pianos in Cuba?

1272
01:02:39,455 --> 01:02:41,415
Because you can't
play worth a fuck.

1273
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:43,191
Just kidding. I'm just kidding.

1274
01:02:43,326 --> 01:02:44,593
Did you know Fidel
Castro started out

1275
01:02:44,595 --> 01:02:45,894
as an actor.

1276
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:48,096
Are you trying to relate?

1277
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:50,365
Yeah. I'm trying
to relate to you.

1278
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:52,067
An Esther
Williams picture called

1279
01:02:52,069 --> 01:02:53,368
Easy to Wed.

1280
01:02:54,303 --> 01:02:55,343
Are you an actor too?

1281
01:02:56,472 --> 01:02:57,739
There can be only one.

1282
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:00,542
Highlander!

1283
01:03:01,577 --> 01:03:05,247
Fuck my
wife? Fuck my wife?

1284
01:03:05,882 --> 01:03:06,815
De Niro!

1285
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:07,983
Thank you.

1286
01:03:07,985 --> 01:03:08,950
Raging Bull.

1287
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:10,652
How do you not know this?

1288
01:03:12,188 --> 01:03:13,455
All right I've got one for you.

1289
01:03:13,723 --> 01:03:15,023
All right. Go for it.

1290
01:03:18,161 --> 01:03:19,594
Natural Born Killers.

1291
01:03:19,729 --> 01:03:21,029
Come on.

1292
01:03:21,031 --> 01:03:22,297
You still -
You didn't know that?

1293
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:23,331
I've got
one. I've got one.

1294
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:24,599
Go for it.

1295
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:29,805
I want to take his face off.

1296
01:03:48,357 --> 01:03:49,558
Nipples of Venus.

1297
01:03:52,395 --> 01:03:53,628
What do you think?

1298
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:01,169
I feel there's
something wanton.

1299
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:03,905
Gauguin was an immature artist.

1300
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:09,144
It's like something, something.

1301
01:04:10,246 --> 01:04:11,406
It doesn't make any sense.

1302
01:04:11,747 --> 01:04:13,181
Any fucking sense.

1303
01:04:14,817 --> 01:04:17,752
You know the reason
is about 17th on the

1304
01:04:17,754 --> 01:04:20,622
list of attributes that
defines us as a species.

1305
01:04:21,224 --> 01:04:22,757
I know honey, you're confused.

1306
01:04:23,059 --> 01:04:24,492
Where you from?

1307
01:04:24,494 --> 01:04:26,374
I'm from Berlin,
Germany, but I live in Austria.

1308
01:04:26,796 --> 01:04:28,663
Oh shit.
Sprechen sie deutsch?

1309
01:04:35,471 --> 01:04:36,951
I feel like
I should bang my heels.

1310
01:04:41,944 --> 01:04:45,480
Look I'm a very
special guy. What's up?

1311
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:48,403
What do you say we
take a walk outside.

1312
01:04:48,784 --> 01:04:49,824
I'll show you around.

1313
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:51,593
You're kind of cute.

1314
01:04:54,757 --> 01:04:55,891
Hm, what do you say?

1315
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:57,259
Good times.

1316
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:00,962
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1317
01:05:01,364 --> 01:05:02,931
You like
it don't you sweetheart?

1318
01:05:03,432 --> 01:05:04,712
She doesn't want to go man.

1319
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:06,001
Come on.

1320
01:05:06,003 --> 01:05:07,269
What do you fucking care?

1321
01:05:07,271 --> 01:05:08,837
I should go into my fake limp.

1322
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:10,305
Have a good night.

1323
01:05:10,307 --> 01:05:11,106
Oh are we cool now?

1324
01:05:11,108 --> 01:05:12,374
Are we boys?

1325
01:05:14,810 --> 01:05:16,144
Oh, oh, oh that's my boy.

1326
01:05:16,146 --> 01:05:17,145
Hey, hey chill.

1327
01:05:17,147 --> 01:05:18,647
Oh, oh big boy like the Hulk.

1328
01:05:18,649 --> 01:05:19,514
Oh!

1329
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:22,150
Oh big boy. Oh big boy.

1330
01:05:22,351 --> 01:05:23,451
Okay, okay.

1331
01:05:26,555 --> 01:05:28,056
Oh, oh hey.

1332
01:05:31,961 --> 01:05:33,194
It's okay man.

1333
01:05:33,196 --> 01:05:34,796
It's not okay,
you fucking pendejo.

1334
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:37,499
Migra. Migra. Migra.

1335
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:38,633
That's racist.

1336
01:05:38,635 --> 01:05:40,802
Migra. Migra. Migra.

1337
01:05:50,346 --> 01:05:51,626
Here, go wait in the car.

1338
01:05:53,082 --> 01:05:53,882
Where's Cliff?

1339
01:05:53,884 --> 01:05:54,783
Who?

1340
01:05:54,785 --> 01:05:56,117
Cliff, where is he?

1341
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:58,420
He took off with
Mr. Potato Head earlier.

1342
01:05:58,422 --> 01:05:59,955
Is she going to be okay?

1343
01:05:59,957 --> 01:06:01,597
Yeah, we're just,
we're going to take off.

1344
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:02,590
Okay.

1345
01:06:02,592 --> 01:06:03,491
What about you?

1346
01:06:03,493 --> 01:06:04,726
You going to be all right?

1347
01:06:04,728 --> 01:06:06,761
Yeah. Yeah I'm
going to get in with

1348
01:06:06,763 --> 01:06:08,063
this Brazilian chick.

1349
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:10,498
It's an ordeal, but
I'm going to pull that.

1350
01:06:12,234 --> 01:06:13,635
Yeah. I'm going to
need my utility belt

1351
01:06:13,637 --> 01:06:16,237
from your car
before you take off.

1352
01:06:54,143 --> 01:06:55,010
How's your head?

1353
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:56,077
It's all right.

1354
01:06:56,479 --> 01:06:57,412
I'm a trooper.

1355
01:06:58,114 --> 01:06:59,347
Let me see.

1356
01:07:10,726 --> 01:07:12,606
Do you have any
napkin or Kleenex?

1357
01:07:12,661 --> 01:07:13,395
No.

1358
01:07:13,829 --> 01:07:15,397
No?

1359
01:07:15,399 --> 01:07:17,759
You're a girl you're supposed
to carry that shit with you.

1360
01:07:21,637 --> 01:07:23,478
Come on let's get
you cleaned up.

1361
01:07:55,337 --> 01:07:57,377
Why do you carry two
tickets for that concert?

1362
01:08:02,645 --> 01:08:04,579
I was hoping to
give one away. You know?

1363
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:06,414
To someone.

1364
01:08:14,523 --> 01:08:15,657
Can I have it?

1365
01:08:18,561 --> 01:08:19,461
No.

1366
01:09:12,381 --> 01:09:13,281
Right.

1367
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:15,917
Cuddlement!

1368
01:09:23,225 --> 01:09:24,759
A girl can dream can't she?

1369
01:09:26,529 --> 01:09:27,809
We're crossing the LA river.

1370
01:09:28,731 --> 01:09:30,465
Which apparently exists.

1371
01:09:37,974 --> 01:09:39,307
I mean sure but it's
like dreaming of being

1372
01:09:39,309 --> 01:09:40,608
a bullfighter when
you're born in like Japan

1373
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:41,976
or England.

1374
01:09:43,212 --> 01:09:44,579
The best dreams
are the ones that

1375
01:09:44,581 --> 01:09:45,813
grow old with us.

1376
01:09:46,382 --> 01:09:48,082
Yeah, but
reality is a grim place.

1377
01:09:48,217 --> 01:09:49,551
Yeah, this is true.

1378
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:54,489
But it's the only place
where you can get mochi.

1379
01:09:54,823 --> 01:09:56,057
What?

1380
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:58,426
Mochi. It's a
Japanese icecream,

1381
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:06,668
but it's light like a vegetable
that dies and gives itself.

1382
01:10:09,905 --> 01:10:11,839
Looks like a scrotum
that died and gave itself.

1383
01:10:18,514 --> 01:10:19,514
Mm.

1384
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:20,715
Mm-hmm.

1385
01:10:21,016 --> 01:10:22,850
If I was food I would be mochi.

1386
01:10:25,321 --> 01:10:26,588
Look, nothing personal.

1387
01:10:26,590 --> 01:10:28,230
I try not to take
anything personally.

1388
01:10:28,857 --> 01:10:33,461
Mm, I think that nothing is
personal for that matter.

1389
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:36,764
Somebody says fuck you.

1390
01:10:37,433 --> 01:10:38,666
It's not about you.

1391
01:10:38,834 --> 01:10:40,754
They've got their
own thing going on.

1392
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:42,437
Or an of self esteem.

1393
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:44,939
Your boyfriend cheated on you.

1394
01:10:44,941 --> 01:10:46,941
Stop looking inwards.

1395
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:51,012
Why not ask one's self,
has he had a good time?

1396
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:53,915
And hope that he
had the best time,

1397
01:10:54,316 --> 01:10:58,019
that she did a super
job emptying him out

1398
01:10:58,021 --> 01:11:00,141
and that it was worth
it and really mean it.

1399
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:01,856
I think there
is girlfriend material

1400
01:11:01,858 --> 01:11:02,757
in you after all.

1401
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:04,225
I know there is.

1402
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:07,161
Can I have some
more of that Japanese shit?

1403
01:11:07,363 --> 01:11:08,229
Mochi.

1404
01:11:08,231 --> 01:11:09,464
Mochi, thanks.

1405
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:11,232
So nice.

1406
01:11:12,134 --> 01:11:14,836
You know what?
I mean you're right.

1407
01:11:15,838 --> 01:11:17,505
People are consumed
with this fucked up need

1408
01:11:17,507 --> 01:11:20,108
to be themselves some sort
of illusion of a meaning.

1409
01:11:20,110 --> 01:11:21,342
You know?

1410
01:11:21,344 --> 01:11:23,678
Kind of like I don't
know Mexicans that

1411
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:24,979
start those car clubs.

1412
01:11:26,248 --> 01:11:27,448
Or the guys with
chest hair that call it

1413
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:28,716
the love carpet.

1414
01:11:28,718 --> 01:11:30,051
Right. So
you understand.

1415
01:11:30,053 --> 01:11:32,287
Yes, you are a little reserved.

1416
01:11:32,289 --> 01:11:33,388
As long as we
are on the same page.

1417
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:34,289
Oh yeah.

1418
01:11:34,291 --> 01:11:35,189
You don't expect me to -

1419
01:11:35,191 --> 01:11:36,024
I don't expect you to.

1420
01:11:36,026 --> 01:11:37,425
Right. Cool.

1421
01:11:37,427 --> 01:11:38,660
You know go all
you can eat buffet on me.

1422
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:39,594
What?

1423
01:11:39,995 --> 01:11:41,429
Yeah?

1424
01:11:41,664 --> 01:11:43,064
Listen you little
dirty minded kraut.

1425
01:11:43,066 --> 01:11:44,365
That's how rumors get started.

1426
01:11:44,367 --> 01:11:46,534
Listen, there's a line in me.

1427
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:48,670
That line separates
everything that is public

1428
01:11:48,672 --> 01:11:51,105
domain from what
belongs only to me.

1429
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:52,974
You have to sense that line.

1430
01:11:53,409 --> 01:11:54,709
Life happens on that line.

1431
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:57,345
Don't try to cross it
or pull me over it.

1432
01:11:58,113 --> 01:12:00,033
You want to meet me on
that line then stay there.

1433
01:12:00,249 --> 01:12:01,582
Do not reach.

1434
01:12:02,718 --> 01:12:04,118
I can get there on my own.

1435
01:12:05,054 --> 01:12:06,387
Besides, people try
to manipulate others

1436
01:12:06,389 --> 01:12:08,556
into crossing that
line to be what they

1437
01:12:08,558 --> 01:12:09,857
want them to be.

1438
01:12:10,192 --> 01:12:13,227
So, let's just stay out
of each other's shit.

1439
01:12:20,769 --> 01:12:22,203
I'm completely lovable.

1440
01:13:06,248 --> 01:13:07,749
Varnie, how about this one?

1441
01:13:08,183 --> 01:13:10,518
Available immediately
in Englewood.

1442
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:12,653
One bedroom basement apartment

1443
01:13:13,021 --> 01:13:14,422
with separate entrance.

1444
01:13:14,424 --> 01:13:16,457
Tastefully decorated
with modern decor.

1445
01:13:16,692 --> 01:13:20,795
Approximately 650 square
feet, security bars

1446
01:13:20,797 --> 01:13:22,430
installed for your
safety and to prevent

1447
01:13:22,432 --> 01:13:24,132
unauthorized activity.

1448
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:28,536
Closed circuit camera installed
for security and safety.

1449
01:13:29,037 --> 01:13:30,972
One in your suite, one
at the entrance and

1450
01:13:30,974 --> 01:13:34,742
one in the exercise yard.
Rent is $850 a month.

1451
01:13:34,877 --> 01:13:37,211
Security deposit required
as well plus first

1452
01:13:37,213 --> 01:13:38,679
and last rent.

1453
01:13:38,681 --> 01:13:40,842
I don't make the rules,
I'm just a fat black woman.

1454
01:13:41,283 --> 01:13:42,483
What else?

1455
01:13:42,785 --> 01:13:44,452
That's it.
There's a number for

1456
01:13:47,290 --> 01:13:49,724
and a full-page ad
for a pack of Newports

1457
01:13:49,726 --> 01:13:51,692
with picture of President Obama.

1458
01:13:53,462 --> 01:13:55,496
I love his name, Barrack Obama.

1459
01:13:56,298 --> 01:13:58,499
That right there says power.

1460
01:13:59,301 --> 01:14:00,468
It sounds like he
should be finding a

1461
01:14:00,470 --> 01:14:01,803
lawyer this weekend.

1462
01:14:02,504 --> 01:14:03,337
Fuck!

1463
01:14:23,826 --> 01:14:24,992
Fuck!

1464
01:14:25,594 --> 01:14:26,527
Battery?

1465
01:14:28,063 --> 01:14:29,297
Do you have another one?

1466
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:31,265
I'm not a
fucking mechanic, Nena.

1467
01:15:08,737 --> 01:15:10,058
Do you have any sunblocker?

1468
01:15:19,581 --> 01:15:20,948
What's your favorite color?

1469
01:15:23,619 --> 01:15:24,652
Huh?

1470
01:15:28,056 --> 01:15:28,789
Car!

1471
01:15:28,791 --> 01:15:29,590
What?

1472
01:15:29,592 --> 01:15:30,424
Car!

1473
01:15:31,126 --> 01:15:32,460
Ooh!

1474
01:16:35,691 --> 01:16:38,025
In my country
when you buy Yugo car

1475
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:42,663
it comes with bus
schedule included.

1476
01:16:44,267 --> 01:16:45,232
Thanks for stopping sir.

1477
01:16:46,034 --> 01:16:47,568
Okay. That's okay.

1478
01:16:50,172 --> 01:16:51,572
My battery took a shit on me.

1479
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:52,647
Do you have jumper cables?

1480
01:16:52,741 --> 01:16:55,276
Ah, I don't. I don't.

1481
01:16:55,278 --> 01:16:57,158
But I'm making a
stop at one place

1482
01:16:57,346 --> 01:16:58,579
they may be able to help.

1483
01:16:59,481 --> 01:17:00,615
Work something out.

1484
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:02,516
Yeah?

1485
01:17:02,518 --> 01:17:04,652
Yeah. Yeah.

1486
01:17:05,821 --> 01:17:07,021
Strap up that piece of shit.

1487
01:17:07,956 --> 01:17:09,090
Thanks that's -

1488
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:10,791
Thank you.

1489
01:17:10,793 --> 01:17:12,473
It's okay. I'd
do it for white guy too.

1490
01:17:12,761 --> 01:17:13,694
You dog.

1491
01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:16,631
Did you saw the rims?

1492
01:17:23,138 --> 01:17:25,406
So, where are you from in LA?

1493
01:17:27,576 --> 01:17:30,311
Well I'm not really from LA.

1494
01:17:30,313 --> 01:17:31,712
That's
okay. That's okay.

1495
01:17:32,114 --> 01:17:34,281
I'm from the biggest
ghetto in Europe. You know?

1496
01:17:37,886 --> 01:17:38,926
Does this bother you?

1497
01:17:50,132 --> 01:17:51,132
Anyways.

1498
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:52,933
I had business in LA.

1499
01:17:53,735 --> 01:17:54,602
Oh yeah?

1500
01:17:56,004 --> 01:17:57,371
Bitter story.

1501
01:17:58,907 --> 01:18:00,074
What kind of business?

1502
01:18:00,842 --> 01:18:02,009
A taxi company.

1503
01:18:02,477 --> 01:18:03,811
That is good.

1504
01:18:03,813 --> 01:18:06,914
It was called Sexy Taxi.

1505
01:18:07,916 --> 01:18:09,183
Wow.

1506
01:18:09,918 --> 01:18:11,686
Cause you know I'm the sex guy.

1507
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:13,487
I know you are.

1508
01:18:14,756 --> 01:18:15,990
Yeah.

1509
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:22,263
I had eleven cars,
sixteen drivers,

1510
01:18:22,931 --> 01:18:24,632
mostly hot Ukrainian bitches.

1511
01:18:25,567 --> 01:18:27,034
Twenty four hours dispatching.

1512
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:29,470
I had accounts,

1513
01:18:30,172 --> 01:18:31,672
two hotels,

1514
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:34,208
bunch of restaurants.

1515
01:18:35,043 --> 01:18:36,177
Some residental.

1516
01:18:42,150 --> 01:18:43,150
What happened?

1517
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:46,253
Fucking shit.

1518
01:18:53,161 --> 01:18:54,195
Do you live around here?

1519
01:18:55,097 --> 01:18:56,330
Not far.

1520
01:18:57,532 --> 01:18:59,492
I'm living with two
bitches right now.

1521
01:19:00,268 --> 01:19:01,502
Two of them?

1522
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:03,771
My father told me two things.

1523
01:19:04,539 --> 01:19:05,539
One,

1524
01:19:05,541 --> 01:19:06,974
"If you are afraid of lonliness

1525
01:19:06,976 --> 01:19:07,908
do not marry."

1526
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:09,510
And two,

1527
01:19:09,512 --> 01:19:13,013
"Real men takes dump
only once a day,

1528
01:19:13,982 --> 01:19:18,018
precisely at noon."

1529
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:28,562
You dog!

1530
01:19:38,073 --> 01:19:39,173
Betsy Kennedy.

1531
01:19:39,908 --> 01:19:41,242
Huh?

1532
01:19:41,877 --> 01:19:44,645
Betsy Kennedy took me
in my first move here.

1533
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:46,981
Fine woman. Fine.

1534
01:19:48,917 --> 01:19:50,151
Nice rack!

1535
01:19:50,685 --> 01:19:51,919
Very nice.

1536
01:19:51,921 --> 01:19:53,921
An ex-boozer who now
believes in Jesus.

1537
01:19:55,357 --> 01:19:56,323
Like Bush.

1538
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:00,394
Bush.

1539
01:20:03,899 --> 01:20:05,432
Other one is Asian,

1540
01:20:07,235 --> 01:20:10,337
traditionally trained the
in art of pleasing a man.

1541
01:20:11,306 --> 01:20:12,540
She's very young.

1542
01:20:12,941 --> 01:20:15,976
But, as they say
in my village...

1543
01:20:17,445 --> 01:20:19,446
The girl is ready when,

1544
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:23,651
my fist can fit into her sock.

1545
01:20:23,885 --> 01:20:24,852
You know?

1546
01:20:28,757 --> 01:20:30,090
I said that to her once,

1547
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:32,760
I thinks she got offended.

1548
01:20:33,995 --> 01:20:34,929
Called me,

1549
01:20:35,597 --> 01:20:36,797
peasant.

1550
01:20:36,965 --> 01:20:38,806
Told me to go back
to my country,

1551
01:20:39,201 --> 01:20:40,634
have sex with my monkey.

1552
01:20:43,872 --> 01:20:45,072
You dog!

1553
01:20:53,481 --> 01:20:58,152
In Germany two
gay penguins adopted

1554
01:20:58,154 --> 01:21:01,455
a chicken that was
thrown out of a parent's

1555
01:21:01,457 --> 01:21:02,356
batch.

1556
01:21:03,124 --> 01:21:04,458
Hm.

1557
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:06,261
Yeah, there was an
article in the Spiegel.

1558
01:21:07,028 --> 01:21:08,028
Spiegel?

1559
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:19,874
Noon.

1560
01:22:41,089 --> 01:22:42,756
Ooh!

1561
01:23:05,146 --> 01:23:06,146
Can I help you?

1562
01:23:07,115 --> 01:23:08,349
Are you Jerry?

1563
01:23:10,251 --> 01:23:11,552
I asked if I can help you.

1564
01:23:12,187 --> 01:23:13,887
I'm from the
Visionary Horizons.

1565
01:23:14,923 --> 01:23:17,558
I'm here for the property
beautification thing.

1566
01:23:19,327 --> 01:23:20,794
So you're the shit man?

1567
01:23:24,466 --> 01:23:26,433
And these guys' battery took.

1568
01:23:26,935 --> 01:23:28,135
It's dead.

1569
01:23:28,336 --> 01:23:30,204
So I thought maybe
you'd be good,

1570
01:23:30,505 --> 01:23:32,206
maybe you'd be kind.

1571
01:23:32,208 --> 01:23:33,440
Yeah?

1572
01:23:34,342 --> 01:23:36,510
The dump is
scheduled for Thursday.

1573
01:23:37,212 --> 01:23:38,679
Come back on Thursday.

1574
01:23:39,881 --> 01:23:41,548
Esmeralda at
the office sent me today.

1575
01:23:43,084 --> 01:23:45,252
There must be some sort
of misunderstanding.

1576
01:23:50,525 --> 01:23:51,925
We just need a jump.

1577
01:23:54,529 --> 01:23:55,809
What the hell's your name?

1578
01:23:56,698 --> 01:23:57,698
Varnie.

1579
01:23:58,733 --> 01:24:00,300
Your face looks familiar.

1580
01:24:01,169 --> 01:24:02,929
Have you been to
the post office recently?

1581
01:24:03,438 --> 01:24:09,510
Yeah. I sent
out 150,000 postcards

1582
01:24:10,245 --> 01:24:11,412
all over the world.

1583
01:24:12,213 --> 01:24:13,414
You know what they said?

1584
01:24:16,684 --> 01:24:17,951
Blow me.

1585
01:24:21,556 --> 01:24:23,590
I don't know why I
did that or what I was

1586
01:24:23,592 --> 01:24:25,125
trying to prove, but -

1587
01:24:27,429 --> 01:24:30,264
All right. You can stay,
but shit man's got to go.

1588
01:24:31,166 --> 01:24:32,866
There must be misunderstanding.

1589
01:24:34,335 --> 01:24:35,696
Why do you keep saying that?

1590
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:41,375
Can you let him do his job?

1591
01:24:41,377 --> 01:24:42,309
Please?

1592
01:24:45,113 --> 01:24:46,346
No.

1593
01:24:46,348 --> 01:24:51,885
Mr. Milutin is
all charged up and

1594
01:24:51,887 --> 01:24:55,122
he really wants to go in there.

1595
01:24:56,057 --> 01:24:58,158
Milutin fucked
up the date okay?

1596
01:24:58,493 --> 01:24:59,827
Why did you fuck that up?

1597
01:25:00,161 --> 01:25:02,296
Milutin. Milutin.

1598
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:05,065
Listen, you know what?

1599
01:25:05,067 --> 01:25:06,600
Don't tell me how to say stuff

1600
01:25:06,602 --> 01:25:10,871
because I'm an American and
I can say it like I please.

1601
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:14,660
Just like they did
on Ellis Island.

1602
01:25:16,144 --> 01:25:17,444
I don't fuck up the date.

1603
01:25:22,383 --> 01:25:23,750
The gypsy girl at the office,

1604
01:25:23,752 --> 01:25:25,385
the receptionist,
she fucked it up.

1605
01:25:25,387 --> 01:25:26,420
She's not a gypsy.

1606
01:25:27,122 --> 01:25:27,955
Are you?

1607
01:25:27,957 --> 01:25:28,755
Me?

1608
01:25:28,757 --> 01:25:29,623
Yeah.

1609
01:25:29,625 --> 01:25:30,324
I'm not a gypsy.

1610
01:25:30,326 --> 01:25:31,024
No?

1611
01:25:31,026 --> 01:25:32,025
No.

1612
01:25:32,027 --> 01:25:32,826
You've got a yellow towel

1613
01:25:32,828 --> 01:25:34,061
on your fucking head.

1614
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:37,698
Fuck this shit

1615
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:39,299
and this creepy motherfucker!

1616
01:25:45,773 --> 01:25:47,007
Hey, Milutin.

1617
01:25:50,578 --> 01:25:52,458
Can I ask you a
personal question?

1618
01:25:55,683 --> 01:25:57,050
Eight inches.

1619
01:26:25,013 --> 01:26:26,079
Peace brother.

1620
01:26:27,582 --> 01:26:28,649
Thanks for the smoke.

1621
01:26:39,761 --> 01:26:41,261
Can I use your restroom?

1622
01:26:45,533 --> 01:26:47,034
I just need to change.

1623
01:26:53,141 --> 01:26:54,841
It's inside on the left.

1624
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:56,677
Thank you.

1625
01:26:56,679 --> 01:26:58,445
Please don't throw
any paper in the bowl.

1626
01:28:12,353 --> 01:28:14,254
I think they have
finch fights going on here.

1627
01:28:14,989 --> 01:28:15,856
What?

1628
01:28:15,858 --> 01:28:17,090
The finch fights.

1629
01:28:17,191 --> 01:28:19,226
It is the new hot
underground thing of

1630
01:28:20,496 --> 01:28:22,095
There's a lot of
betting involved and the

1631
01:28:22,097 --> 01:28:24,665
way they fight them
they would put two

1632
01:28:24,667 --> 01:28:26,867
male finches and one
female in one cage

1633
01:28:26,869 --> 01:28:28,568
and they male would
fight to death.

1634
01:28:28,570 --> 01:28:29,836
Okay, calm down.

1635
01:28:29,838 --> 01:28:31,305
Sometimes they
put pieces of razors

1636
01:28:31,307 --> 01:28:32,439
on their little claws.

1637
01:28:32,441 --> 01:28:33,841
There was an article
in the Spiegel.

1638
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:35,242
What's the Spiegel?

1639
01:28:35,244 --> 01:28:36,576
I really think
we should do something.

1640
01:28:36,711 --> 01:28:38,812
Listen, no one
cares what you think.

1641
01:28:38,814 --> 01:28:40,047
You have a Facebook account.

1642
01:28:40,748 --> 01:28:41,988
And what's up with the jacket?

1643
01:28:42,984 --> 01:28:44,551
I thought I looked respectable.

1644
01:28:45,286 --> 01:28:49,356
Just stay where
I can see you please.

1645
01:29:12,013 --> 01:29:13,280
Done.

1646
01:29:13,948 --> 01:29:15,315
All that's missing is a.

1647
01:29:15,683 --> 01:29:16,983
- I
- Don't have one on me.

1648
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:21,555
Well go get it
you stupid little fuck.

1649
01:29:22,323 --> 01:29:23,644
What the fuck am
I paying you for?

1650
01:29:23,758 --> 01:29:24,658
You're not paying me.

1651
01:29:24,660 --> 01:29:25,700
I'm your son-in-law.

1652
01:29:26,594 --> 01:29:27,994
Can't you just be useful?

1653
01:29:29,163 --> 01:29:30,130
Be useful.

1654
01:29:31,799 --> 01:29:33,200
Come on little fuck. Get up.

1655
01:29:39,674 --> 01:29:41,041
He knows I'm kidding.

1656
01:29:41,043 --> 01:29:42,376
He likes it.

1657
01:29:43,311 --> 01:29:45,912
So I don't think
my car needs a.

1658
01:29:47,782 --> 01:29:50,217
Every car needs a, man.

1659
01:29:50,718 --> 01:29:52,018
I don't even know what a is.

1660
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:53,980
It sounds foreign
and kind of pervy.

1661
01:29:55,189 --> 01:29:57,724
A is a
revolutionary air freshener.

1662
01:29:59,894 --> 01:30:02,763
It smells like spring rain.

1663
01:30:03,531 --> 01:30:06,166
It also releases negative ions,

1664
01:30:06,434 --> 01:30:07,434
as well as oxygen.

1665
01:30:07,902 --> 01:30:09,136
It keeps you kind of -

1666
01:30:09,937 --> 01:30:11,304
It keeps you kind of perky.

1667
01:30:12,073 --> 01:30:14,307
I'm in charge of
marketing for this region.

1668
01:30:14,809 --> 01:30:16,309
Maybe you can get
on board and spread

1669
01:30:16,311 --> 01:30:18,078
the word and make some cash.

1670
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:23,450
I'm sure it's different
from crack money.

1671
01:30:25,052 --> 01:30:26,453
But green is green.

1672
01:30:47,542 --> 01:30:49,062
So what do I
owe you for the work?

1673
01:30:49,777 --> 01:30:51,011
Don't worry about it.

1674
01:30:51,546 --> 01:30:52,846
Jerry's not a ballbreaker.

1675
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:54,548
He wants to help.

1676
01:30:54,782 --> 01:30:57,050
Today is my youngest
grandson's birthday.

1677
01:30:57,385 --> 01:30:58,718
He turns four.

1678
01:30:58,720 --> 01:31:00,800
We're going to make a
surprise party for him.

1679
01:31:01,823 --> 01:31:05,659
He's got some sort of deep
psychological problems.

1680
01:31:06,027 --> 01:31:09,696
He likes to headbutt
stuff like an angry

1681
01:31:09,698 --> 01:31:11,264
mountain goat.

1682
01:31:13,334 --> 01:31:14,634
Bam! Bam! Bam!

1683
01:31:20,908 --> 01:31:23,677
The kid's only four and he's
already losing his shit.

1684
01:31:24,245 --> 01:31:26,446
The only thing that
really calms him down

1685
01:31:26,448 --> 01:31:27,781
is birds.

1686
01:31:29,283 --> 01:31:31,444
Now even all the birds
are killing each other

1687
01:31:32,153 --> 01:31:33,453
We have to separate them.

1688
01:31:38,659 --> 01:31:39,626
Strange.

1689
01:31:48,135 --> 01:31:49,002
Take care man.

1690
01:31:49,004 --> 01:31:49,703
All right.

1691
01:31:53,941 --> 01:31:54,841
Drive.

1692
01:31:55,109 --> 01:31:55,976
What did you do?

1693
01:31:55,978 --> 01:31:56,710
Just drive.

1694
01:32:33,681 --> 01:32:34,921
I'm adopted
too. You know?

1695
01:32:35,082 --> 01:32:36,416
Really?

1696
01:32:37,318 --> 01:32:39,819
I mean I can't
prove it but you know

1697
01:32:40,087 --> 01:32:41,388
I'm pretty sure.

1698
01:32:43,658 --> 01:32:45,778
So how many guys have
you been with before me?

1699
01:32:54,168 --> 01:32:55,101
25.

1700
01:32:56,103 --> 01:32:57,070
Not bad.

1701
01:32:58,739 --> 01:32:59,806
How about yourself?

1702
01:33:00,474 --> 01:33:01,441
How many girls?

1703
01:33:01,976 --> 01:33:03,043
About 60 I think.

1704
01:33:03,811 --> 01:33:04,744
Very good.

1705
01:33:04,912 --> 01:33:05,845
Yeah.

1706
01:33:10,051 --> 01:33:10,951
You want to know
why I didn't want

1707
01:33:10,953 --> 01:33:12,113
to try on those flip flops?

1708
01:33:12,753 --> 01:33:14,087
Yesterday back at the store.

1709
01:33:14,922 --> 01:33:16,423
Why?

1710
01:33:17,592 --> 01:33:21,227
Because I didn't
cut my nails, my toenails.

1711
01:33:23,731 --> 01:33:25,265
Yeah.

1712
01:33:25,633 --> 01:33:27,553
I thought you might
be having alpha bitch toe.

1713
01:33:28,102 --> 01:33:29,302
A what?

1714
01:33:30,171 --> 01:33:31,972
There's a popular
belief that your

1715
01:33:31,974 --> 01:33:34,507
status in the relationship
is predetermined

1716
01:33:34,509 --> 01:33:35,809
by your toes.

1717
01:33:35,943 --> 01:33:38,378
So, if your big toe
is bigger than the one

1718
01:33:38,380 --> 01:33:40,447
next to it the male would
be in charge meaning

1719
01:33:40,449 --> 01:33:41,748
you're an alpha male.

1720
01:33:41,750 --> 01:33:43,483
But if the one next to
your big toe is bigger,

1721
01:33:43,485 --> 01:33:46,152
I call it a wingman, meaning
you're an alpha bitch.

1722
01:33:46,921 --> 01:33:49,456
But the thing about it
is what really matters is

1723
01:33:49,458 --> 01:33:50,457
the mix.

1724
01:33:50,992 --> 01:33:52,592
Two big toes make a good couple.

1725
01:33:52,827 --> 01:33:54,561
A big toe and a wingman
means there will

1726
01:33:54,563 --> 01:33:55,929
be bloodshed.

1727
01:33:56,297 --> 01:33:58,565
Two wingmen probably
means that the couple

1728
01:33:58,733 --> 01:34:00,967
will burn over low
flame of depression for

1729
01:34:00,969 --> 01:34:02,202
the rest of their life.

1730
01:34:02,603 --> 01:34:03,770
Because one will always
look to the other

1731
01:34:03,772 --> 01:34:05,071
to cut the ribbon.

1732
01:34:07,341 --> 01:34:10,243
Well, I ain't
got the alpha bitch.

1733
01:34:13,147 --> 01:34:14,547
Do not walk in front of me.

1734
01:34:14,849 --> 01:34:16,116
I may not follow.

1735
01:34:16,917 --> 01:34:19,019
Do not walk behind
me, I may not lead.

1736
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:22,555
Just walk beside me
and be my friend.

1737
01:34:34,435 --> 01:34:35,969
I don't give a fuck about toes.

1738
01:34:37,772 --> 01:34:39,406
I also shuffle my
feet like a Japenese girl

1739
01:34:39,408 --> 01:34:40,329
in high heels.

1740
01:34:44,345 --> 01:34:46,345
Works better with a
bunch of shopping bags.

1741
01:37:19,867 --> 01:37:20,867
Wow.

1742
01:37:22,136 --> 01:37:23,036
You like that?

1743
01:37:23,571 --> 01:37:24,971
So tight.

1744
01:37:24,973 --> 01:37:26,773
It was sad and
beautiful at the same time.

1745
01:37:27,341 --> 01:37:28,341
That's what we do.

1746
01:37:28,343 --> 01:37:29,464
We turn pain into profit.

1747
01:37:29,743 --> 01:37:31,244
We do at that.

1748
01:37:31,246 --> 01:37:33,112
Just like Adele who has
been crying over the same

1749
01:37:33,114 --> 01:37:34,681
guy for four years now.

1750
01:37:36,151 --> 01:37:37,391
So, where are you guys from?

1751
01:37:37,751 --> 01:37:38,751
We're from LA.

1752
01:37:38,919 --> 01:37:40,086
Oh right on.

1753
01:37:40,088 --> 01:37:41,287
Michael is from LA.

1754
01:37:41,289 --> 01:37:43,169
He's a writer, a
screen play writer.

1755
01:37:43,290 --> 01:37:44,757
Not a screenplay writer.

1756
01:37:45,092 --> 01:37:48,761
I ejaculate the vulgar
concepts of my insane mind

1757
01:37:48,763 --> 01:37:50,029
onto the paper.

1758
01:37:50,031 --> 01:37:51,264
He wrote a screenplay.

1759
01:37:51,266 --> 01:37:52,565
Tell them about the
screenplay you wrote.

1760
01:37:52,567 --> 01:37:53,867
I did. I did
write a screenplay.

1761
01:37:53,869 --> 01:37:56,536
It's about the world's
first gay superhero.

1762
01:37:56,904 --> 01:38:00,240
His name is Bjorn and he's
simultaneously battling

1763
01:38:00,242 --> 01:38:02,876
evil and his own
sexual identity.

1764
01:38:03,477 --> 01:38:04,477
Dope.

1765
01:38:05,112 --> 01:38:06,412
Straight.

1766
01:38:06,414 --> 01:38:08,134
Are you guys going
to see Blonde Priest?

1767
01:38:08,682 --> 01:38:09,916
I don't now what that is.

1768
01:38:09,918 --> 01:38:11,484
Is that like a
rapper or something?

1769
01:38:11,486 --> 01:38:13,853
I mean I respect the brothers
and their energy and all

1770
01:38:13,855 --> 01:38:17,824
but sometimes I'm like
dude can you stop cussing

1771
01:38:17,826 --> 01:38:19,125
over that song?

1772
01:38:19,127 --> 01:38:19,893
No,
no. Blonde Priest are

1773
01:38:19,895 --> 01:38:21,461
like new age.

1774
01:38:21,463 --> 01:38:24,530
They're like alternative kind
of like that song Fireflies.

1775
01:38:24,698 --> 01:38:26,432
It's anal sex music, basically.

1776
01:38:26,967 --> 01:38:28,434
Dope.

1777
01:38:28,436 --> 01:38:31,237
No, no, no. They
are not singing Fireflies.

1778
01:38:31,472 --> 01:38:32,605
They are a band.

1779
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:34,073
Blonde Priest is a band.

1780
01:38:34,075 --> 01:38:35,375
No, Pink Floyd is a band.

1781
01:38:35,377 --> 01:38:36,309
Pink Floyd is a band.

1782
01:38:36,311 --> 01:38:37,543
U2 is a band.

1783
01:38:37,778 --> 01:38:39,245
Rolling Stones, The Strokes.

1784
01:38:40,047 --> 01:38:41,381
I am going to start a band and

1785
01:38:41,383 --> 01:38:42,982
it's going to be
called Punk Floyd.

1786
01:38:43,150 --> 01:38:44,484
- I
- Mean what are they going

1787
01:38:44,486 --> 01:38:45,985
to perform for some
fireman's funeral?

1788
01:38:46,253 --> 01:38:48,021
We'll perform
Pink Floyd covers,

1789
01:38:48,023 --> 01:38:49,255
but they will be punk.

1790
01:38:49,423 --> 01:38:50,323
Dope.

1791
01:38:51,225 --> 01:38:52,225
This is a fact.

1792
01:38:52,826 --> 01:38:54,294
Bob Dylan and the Beatles

1793
01:38:54,495 --> 01:38:56,329
single handedly ruined music.

1794
01:38:56,563 --> 01:38:57,864
I agree.

1795
01:38:57,866 --> 01:38:58,865
Why aren't there more French

1796
01:38:58,867 --> 01:39:00,433
rock bands?

1797
01:39:00,435 --> 01:39:01,267
I think Paul McCartney's
best work was with Wings.

1798
01:39:01,402 --> 01:39:02,669
I play bass.

1799
01:39:02,671 --> 01:39:03,970
- I
- Like to eat melon.

1800
01:39:04,705 --> 01:39:06,005
Would it be
weird if I had a crow

1801
01:39:06,007 --> 01:39:07,307
as a pet?

1802
01:39:07,975 --> 01:39:10,076
Hey, you want to jam with us?

1803
01:39:13,147 --> 01:39:14,080
Funf.

1804
01:39:26,293 --> 01:39:27,126
Dope.
