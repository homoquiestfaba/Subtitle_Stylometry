1
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,909
We're lucky. In the fourth season of a TV
show, you rarely get to build a whole new set.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,471
So we had to come to this new building.
We never had a great exterior of CTU.

3
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,872
So, close by there's this building
that has these beautiful feet.

4
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,636
And so I thought,
"Well, if we used that as the exterior of CTU,

5
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,475
and then I took that architecture
inside into the set...

6
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,596
would be a good starting-off point. "

7
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,755
I was stuck from the pilot with
the original CTU they shot at FOXSports.com.

8
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,550
And although we then built
that whole set on stage

9
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,598
and brought some more
hi-tech elements into it,

10
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,319
I was stuck with the orange and, you know,

11
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,870
after three years
we were all pretty sick of the orange.

12
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,712
Spatially, the old CTU worked great.

13
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,396
So it's basically the same layout.
The ceiling is only at 20 feet.

14
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,790
So it's just trying to fit
two storeys in that space.

15
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,158
And again, because it's not a regular
studio stage, we don't have any greenbed,

16
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,879
so I wanted to build
a platform all the way round

17
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,112
so the DP could get around, to help him light.

18
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,273
We had metal steps last year and all the wires,
and there was always...

19
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,920
with our platforms
there was a problem with sound.

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,356
So this year I've designed
these concrete steps.

21
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,874
Hopefully they won't make too much noise.

22
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,590
So, yeah, when I design something,
I try to take care of everybody.

23
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,116
There are limits because
otherwise I end up pleasing everybody,

24
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:09,471
and we don't end up
with a set that looks cool.

25
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,111
The stripes on the windows,
the frosting, we've put that in again.

26
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:19,513
One, because it helps us with sort of hiding
behind things and shooting through the gaps.

27
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:24,355
I've changed them this time. They're not just...
We've actually done a bar code.

28
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,035
It's all in code,
and I'll never tell anybody what it says, but...

29
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,236
So what's the bar code?

30
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,359
- It just says lots of things.
- Come on.

31
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,954
- Well, no, this is my secret.
- Give it up.

32
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,919
One of them's just my name.
It's just "Joseph Hodges" on one of them.

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,195
Yeah, no, it's all in code.

34
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,596
I love racecars. I love Formula One.

35
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,355
Lots of the sets are based on
color schemes of cars.

36
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,149
Last year the NHS was the Renault -
the yellow and blue.

37
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,915
It's just me being a kid and messing around.

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,912
We build this track out on stage.

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,551
Once the set's finished,
the construction crew and I, every lunchtime,

40
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,474
we have lunch and we race these little cars.

41
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,154
So here's Andrew, my art director.

42
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,993
I hate saying "my". Can we do that again?

43
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,878
This is Andrew, the show's art director.

44
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,349
And Jeff, the set designer on the show.

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,231
And so a lot of my job
is actually working with the set designer

46
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:31,393
to do these scale drawings that
I can communicate to the construction crew,

47
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,074
so that we can then build the actual designs.

48
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:40,235
So, for instance, here's the large schematic
of the whole set. Dimension to scale.

49
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:45,394
So in, really, layman's terms,
we're like the architects of film.

50
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,755
So, this is stage A.

51
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,799
But this is the main stage and CTU.

52
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:02,756
So here it is. The half-finished
or three-quarters-finished CTU.

53
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,829
And on this particular job,
we had prop makers, who are like carpenters,

54
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,717
steelworkers,

55
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,950
plasterers, painters,

56
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,600
who all came together in different sequences

57
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,959
to actually put this design together -
what you saw out on stage.

58
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,310
So by the time we started building,
we were a good five, six weeks behind.

59
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:59,032
And I think we've been building
just for six... six weeks now.

60
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,238
And it's amazing what they've...
I've got a great construction crew.

61
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,790
What they've pulled off
in this time is unbelievable.

62
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,395
And it's been very exciting.

63
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,951
Most of the construction's done.
We're still doing a little bit of plaster.

64
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:20,592
All the shop-window fronts have gone in.
We're just gonna put the glass in.

65
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,194
And then all the striping on the window.

66
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,238
And then a week of set dressing.

67
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,118
We started to put the tables in.

68
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,709
This is gonna be our new interrogation room.

69
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,679
It's wood construction with plaster
over the top, then we chop out corners

70
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:47,072
and throw some stonework in so -
you know, get a good close-up of that -

71
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,914
feels like the whole set is cast concrete.

72
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,472
There's no concrete. It's just plaster. These
are cast plaster. We sculpted one mould.

73
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,190
I think that's probably a sheet from there...

74
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,669
to somewhere around there.

75
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,591
This is the interrogation room.

76
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,276
We'll put some grating in the ceilings,
have these beautiful stripes on the actors.

77
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:17,515
We can light through that. The sound man can
get up there and not have to be down here.

78
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,515
These are the new stairs. We had metal stairs
last year and they made a lot of noise.

79
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,160
So this year I went with these concrete stairs.

80
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,550
We had these specially made,
specially cast for us.

81
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:34,033
And the same guys that did all the steelwork
have built these beautiful steps.

82
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:41,429
So, originally in the computer when I built the
model, it was just a regular concrete color,

83
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:47,158
and I put a light
behind those windows and it just...

84
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,310
I put a little bit of a blue tint to it,

85
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,710
and it just gave this concrete
a really nice blue color.

86
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,315
So when we came to paint the set,

87
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,075
I thought I'd add the blue into the concrete,
and it's turned out well.

88
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,799
Some of it's got dirty
and we'll have to clean it,

89
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,759
but, you know, it's like I was saying earlier,

90
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:12,551
it was that lovely oldness
and used look to the building.

91
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:19,193
It's been beaten up, it's been here a few years.
This furniture we've had specially made.

92
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,989
Again, the construction
have built these tables.

93
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,676
Our furniture has this nice sheen to it.
It's new, it's modern.

94
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,830
And again, the curve, so we can...

95
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,798
Jon wanted to be able
to shoot around people more.

96
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:38,271
And again, we've made it in four units
so we can quickly take this stuff out

97
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,478
and redress this area as another place in CTU.

98
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,348
Damon did a beautiful paintjob.
They'll paint it once, sand it,

99
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,432
paint it again, sand it and paint it again.

100
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,592
It might last a couple of weeks.

101
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,399
This is Damon, my head painter.

102
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,471
- Our head painter.
- Right on.

103
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,870
This is the man that pulls all this work off,
all that beautiful...

104
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,993
I'm trying to get inside of that brain
and figure out what he's aiming at here.

105
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,469
To do a design...

106
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,757
and then actually build it full size
is like being a kid.

107
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,196
Instead of doing a drawing
and building a model of something,

108
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:20,876
now I've got a whole team of guys
who will build it full size.

109
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:27,910
Again, because I'm allowed to play,
this is fantasy. This is all fantasy work.

110
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,072
Hopefully, it still feels real, but it's playful.

111
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,354
You can see how low the ceiling is.
I mean, we're 20 feet to this grid.

112
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:43,077
This is one of my favorite angles, looking
down that way through this foot, the stairs.

113
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,993
So that'll be the conference area down there.

114
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,640
This'll be the front office

115
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,918
where Jack used to have an office,
up the front, in the second season.

116
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,118
You can see we've got about 20 guys,
and these have perhaps been the main guys.

117
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,316
There's only...

118
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,989
It's been... I've been surprised
how small the crew's been,

119
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,548
but they're so good.

120
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:10,957
And I think we've only been building
for six weeks. Six to seven weeks.

121
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,033
You know, hopefully in two weeks...

122
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,192
when we're in here and ready to shoot,

123
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,033
I mean, I'm excited already.

124
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,075
It should be fun. I'm excited. I can't wait
to see the dailies to see what it looks like.

125
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,436
And then once Rodney's put his lights in,

126
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,317
it's gonna feel...

127
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,198
Hopefully, it's just gonna be great.

128
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,794
- Joseph, that's such a great cameo for you.
- What?

129
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,950
The first shot in CTU.

130
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,795
Take off the hat and sit up there.
You're dressed right. Put him in. Put him in.

131
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,236
Just where you were with that chair.
Right there would be great.

132
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:12,519
We should try to get Joseph in one shot
in every episode. Wouldn't that be cool?

133
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,274
Marker out! And action!

134
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,509
Action! Action!

135
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,151
Our show really is about our people, and
our show is tight and a little claustrophobic.

136
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,596
So, I think the hardest thing,
and for me, right away,

137
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,196
but even then, for me to make sure other
directors understand, as beautiful as this is,

138
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,795
we don't do a show about a set,
we do a show about the people in the set.

139
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,839
And so it's about making use of the set,
but keeping the people in play,

140
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,070
and still, it's about telling the story.

141
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,519
First of all, I was really amazed,
cos I knew it wasn't as big a building

142
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,831
but I was amazed
at how much bigger the set feels.

143
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,310
I mean, if you look around,
I get a real sense of distance here,

144
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,278
more so than we had in the old CTU.

145
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,355
This is what we do at lunchtime.
This is my construction crew and myself.

146
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,230
We come here and just play at lunchtime.
Little boys with little toys.

147
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,155
It's mainly because
it enables me and the construction crew

148
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,391
just to hang out at lunchtime
and just have fun.

149
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,598
I'm not the boss or anything.
It's just boys having fun.

150
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,911
You know, what goes on in the race room
stays in the race room.

151
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,917
Quiet, please!

152
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,991
All background players, listen up.

153
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:58,312
So there's a train crash
that happened about ten or 15 minutes ago,

154
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:03,758
that you guys are finding out may have
in fact been some sort of a terrorist act.

155
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,718
So, keep that in mind. Think about:

156
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:12,477
"OK, I've got to get this information
over to Jack or Jimmy in Tech One. "

157
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,870
Sort of give yourself
a sense of purpose and a sense of place

158
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,191
so you don't look like that man
just walking through now, OK?

159
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,432
Let's make it less just lateral movement
and more sort of stop-starts,

160
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,988
as though they're transferring business...

161
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,959
Got it. So instead of playing that stuff there,
do it here. OK, guys?

162
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,634
- <i>O'Brian.</i>
- <i>Chloe, it's Edgar Stiles.</i>

163
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,917
<i>You don't need to use your last name.
You've been here over a month. What is it?</i>

164
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,035
Cut! You know, Richard,
you know what I'm gonna say.

165
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,271
No one's stopping.
No one's stopping and talking.

166
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,352
Everybody, it's Grand Central Station.

167
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,317
Let's get some luggage.

168
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,513
Marc's gonna bring us
the "Behind the Scenes".

169
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,353
- Which one's this?
- For this year's DVD.

170
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,237
Oh. Yeah?

171
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,630
- He's got me swearing again.
- Oh, they have?

172
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,429
It's become a weekly thing.
It's becoming a yearly thing now.

173
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,397
Oy, oy, oy, oy, oy.

174
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,553
We'd have finished these two scenes
in about three hours on a normal CTU day.

175
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,315
- But we're here for the first time...
- We had three hours for the first scene.

176
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,915
When you have a new space,
you have to deal with the new space.

177
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:23,352
It isn’t just the physicality of desks
and chairs and walls and, you know, tables.

178
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,635
We need to then put people to populate it.

179
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,874
So, after, you know, three years in one place,
back at the old studio, back at CTU,

180
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:35,670
you sort of fell into a pattern and knew where
you needed people and how everyone moved.

181
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,878
This is a whole new space.
So this first day is difficult.

182
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,191
What's happening is,
because it's wider than the old space,

183
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:46,989
is that there's a tendency
to move people through it all the time.

184
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:51,790
It might look good by eye, but when you see
it on camera, especially with the long lenses,

185
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,348
it really becomes like Grand Central Station.

186
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,638
So we gotta really be careful of the movement
and where we start to put people,

187
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,748
to make it feel like these people are at work,
they're not all just going for coffee breaks.

188
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:08,118
So, the first day is always the hardest
to start to get that gelling.

189
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:15,239
It's interesting, because
a new set becomes part of the storytelling.

190
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:20,075
Seeing it for the first time becomes part
of telling a new story for the people watching.

191
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,199
So I've decided to shoot
all the early CTU scenes very tight.

192
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,236
So again, people will think:

193
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,393
"Is that the old CTU? Is that the same place?
We're not 100 per cent sure. "

194
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,271
And then when Jack comes in, he's been here
before, but he's seeing it for the first time.

195
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,319
And so I want to be there with Jack
and see it for the first time with him.

196
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,949
He'll look around, and as he looks around,
our camera looks around.

197
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:48,318
And he'll move, and we'll do big wide shots
to really get a sense of the space.

198
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:54,714
That way, we discover CTU at the same time
our lead character discovers CTU.

199
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,828
It becomes... The audience feels like they're
with Jack, instead of being ahead of Jack.

200
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,309
That's how we'll do it on the first episode.

201
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,998
Cut!

202
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,755
So do you ask for a raise now,
or did you ask for a raise?

203
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:14,197
Probably at the beginning of next season
I'll ask for a raise. No.

204
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:18,319
It's... I dunno what to say, really.
It's just working really, really well.

205
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,960
Hopefully it'll last the season.

206
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,428
Here you go, sir. $65,000.
Everything in your account.

207
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,556
Thanks.

208
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:30,272
Got a beautiful-looking saloon right here.
The 350Z, you gotta love those.

209
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,635
I could show you a couple of hatchbacks.

210
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,632
I'll take the convertible.

211
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,870
What?

212
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,315
I'll take the 350.

213
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,109
Well, that's great.
It's a good-looking car.

214
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,908
Coffee, sir?

215
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,639
More coffee?

216
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,719
Nobody move! This is a robbery!

217
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,669
Give me the money! Put the money
in the bag! Come on! All of it!

218
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,832
Hurry! Come on, put it in!

219
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,239
Hurry!

220
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,517
- Put in all of it, all right?
- Give me the bag!

221
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,435
- Put it in the bag.
- The bag!

222
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,351
Put it in there!

223
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,317
No.

224
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,716
- Come on, put it in.
- Take it. That's it. That's it.

225
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,991
Let's go. Come on!

226
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,717
You are crazy.
You could have been shot back there.

227
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:12,193
You should have just handed over the bag.
You are either really brave or really stupid.

228
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,238
What have you got in there, anyway?

229
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,914
It's none of your business.

230
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,151
You want a ride?

231
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,198
- Thanks for the ride.
- See you later, buddy. Take it easy.

232
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,233
<i>You've reached John and Tara.
We're not here.</i>

233
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,995
<i>Leave a message and we'll get back to you
as soon as we can. Thanks a lot.</i>

234
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,877
Hi.

235
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,708
Are you going east?

236
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,752
- Yeah.
- Can I get a ride?

237
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,438
- Sure.
- Thank you so much.

238
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,631
I was getting a little nervous. Didn't
think that anybody was gonna pick me up.

239
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,396
And the last guy that I was in the car with,
he was a little creepy, so I had to tell him:

240
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,392
"I'm gonna karate chop you
if you do anything. "

241
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,712
That's really intimidating, huh?
Can I have another one? I'm really hungry.

242
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,997
Maybe we can stop somewhere
and get something to eat.

243
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,957
Do you think these things work?

244
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:28,319
It'd be kinda cool if they made one
that smelled like curry or something.

245
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,709
I love curry. Do you like curry?

246
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,873
I love anything curry.
Spicy, everything spicy is good for me.

247
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:43,598
I love that song.

248
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,191
You're not a big chatter, huh?

249
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,280
I hope I'm not, like, totally aggravating you.

250
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,352
I'm sorry. I'll be quiet, OK?

251
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,393
It's nice out, though.

252
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,189
Where are you going, anyway?
It's kind of out in the middle of nowhere.

253
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,192
I mean, I guess you could be going anywhere.

254
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,875
I'm just glad you're going my way.

255
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,668
What is that?

256
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,555
What is that?

257
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,754
- I'm going to take a look.
- No. Don't.

258
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,036
He's alive!

259
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:05,075
- What are you doing?
- Don't you want to know who he is?

260
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,639
- I don't think you should go through that.
- Gold card. Maybe he's rich.

261
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,836
Doesn't have a lot of cash.

262
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,832
Strip club. I bet you the wife did it.

263
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,639
Hey! Hey!

264
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,354
Hey!

265
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,069
You think that guy made it?

266
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,109
I don't know.

267
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,111
What's that guy doing?

268
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,989
We need to change cars.

269
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,674
Check. Check, please.

270
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,591
I got it.

271
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:20,834
You have, like, one blue eye
and one hazel-blue with a quarter hazel,

272
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,150
and one blue over here.

273
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,435
It's kinda good for the chicks.

274
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,432
- Is it?
- Yeah.

275
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,236
- What do you think you are?
- I never...

276
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:43,190
I think... I think that I would be really cool
with, like, a Great Dane. Don't you think?

277
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,108
You're weird.

278
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,393
Do you like summer or winter?

279
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,074
- Summer.
- Why?

280
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,630
- Cos it's warm. I don't know.
- That's it?

281
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,995
- My birthday is in summer.
- Really?

282
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,594
What's your sign? What are you?

283
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,796
Cancer.

284
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,632
July.

285
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:14,639
- Oh, God. I'm gonna have a psychic moment.
- You're gonna guess. OK.

286
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,632
- 19th.
- Wow. Pretty close.

287
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,757
No. You failed.

288
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,634
I have a joke.

289
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,312
- A blonde goes into the library.
- OK.

290
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,039
Yeah. She goes up to the desk and she says:

291
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,998
"I want a burger, I want some fries

292
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,355
and a diet coke. "

293
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,149
And the lady's like,
"Uh, hello? This is a library. "

294
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,117
And she's like, "Oh, oh. "

295
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,158
"I'll have a burger, fries

296
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,629
and a soda. "

297
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,838
I'm just after these mailboxes here.

298
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,474
This is me.

299
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,869
You want me to drive you in?

300
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,269
No. I can walk.

301
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,318
- Take care.
- Thank you.

302
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,556
Hey!

303
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,110
Hey!

304
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:24,316
Have you ever wanted
to know more about the world of <i>24</i>?

305
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,712
Did you ever wonder how President Palmer
recovered from the attempt on his life?

306
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,759
Who was really behind the assassination
attempt and why did it fail?

307
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,991
Who ran the country
while Palmer fought for his life?

308
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:40,231
Have you ever been curious
why Kim started working at CTU

309
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,278
and how she and Chase Edmunds
first got together?

310
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:48,309
Ever wondered how Chloe O'Brian first
came into contact with the Los Angeles CTU?

311
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,439
How did Jack and Chase Edmunds
first start working together?

312
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:57,310
Ever wonder what it would be like
to live 24 hours in the life of Jack Bauer?

313
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,710
You can discover the answer
to these and more questions

314
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,997
as you experience them in <i>24: The Game</i>.

315
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:14,639
Set in the critical months following
the close of <i>24</i>'s second season,

316
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:19,840
you step into the role of Jack Bauer and
his fellow CTU agents, playing out the story,

317
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:26,553
learning the answers to intriguing questions,
deadly secrets and hidden conspiracies.

318
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,276
Players, like the characters in the show,
will need to rely on

319
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:35,639
their brains, brawn and instincts
in order to succeed and survive.

320
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,995
The creators of Fox's <i>24</i> television show

321
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:42,629
worked with Sony Computer
Entertainment's Cambridge Studio

322
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,188
to produce <i>24: The Game</i>.

323
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,829
The two teams collaborated
to mould the look and feel of the game

324
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:55,314
to remain true to the series, with the same
gritty raw intensity that <i>24</i> is known for.

325
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,960
Myself and the rest of <i>24</i>'s principal cast

326
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:02,033
have lent our voices
and likenesses to the game.

327
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:07,914
Not only will you recognize
your favorite characters from the show,

328
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,070
but every detail will be familiar,

329
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:15,951
even down to the music, written and
performed by series composer Sean Callery.

330
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,430
Imagine a true interactive <i>24</i> experience.

331
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,798
Split-second decisions with lives
hanging in the balance, deadly missions,

332
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,633
all set against a 24-hour clock.

333
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,353
Kim, settle down.

334
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,353
- They killed him! Why did they kill him?
- They want the hard drive.

335
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,556
- Are they gonna kill more?
- Maybe.

336
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,799
How steady is your aim
when the president's life is on the line?

337
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:49,793
How fast and how accurately
can you think on your feet?

338
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:53,998
Are you willing to do what it takes
to get the answers that you need?

339
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:58,710
<i>I own you! You're not going anywhere
until I say otherwise, so tell me what I need!</i>

340
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:03,193
Can you survive 24 hours
in the life of Jack Bauer?

341
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,708
