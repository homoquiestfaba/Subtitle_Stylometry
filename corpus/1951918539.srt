1
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,229
Miserable country, miserable people.

2
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:20,109
And we're in the worst of it.

3
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:24,757
The Belzan.

4
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,667
Chechen folk tales don't concern me,
only Chechen bullets.

5
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:34,395
But so many stories,
and they all have the same ending.

6
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:37,670
Anyone who enters
the forest never leaves.

7
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:38,754
What?

8
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,074
<i>Special Ops Patrol Charlie, ETA?</i>

9
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:44,236
- Answer the radio.
- Yes, sir.

10
00:02:45,359 --> 00:02:49,147
Alpha Base, this is Charlie.
About 15 minutes.

11
00:02:51,279 --> 00:02:52,632
<i>Ten-four, Charlie.</i>

12
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:57,071
Why'd you stop?

13
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:01,113
At the last village
there was a child missing.

14
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:03,628
We make ourselves
a target out here.

15
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,275
Radio control,
this is Major Korkov.

16
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:11,230
Investigating a bicycle.

17
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:15,512
Radio control?

18
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:19,797
- What's wrong with the radio?
- I have no idea.

19
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,158
Radio control?

20
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:25,868
Haunted.

21
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,638
Outside.

22
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:47,749
Secure the area. Report anything.

23
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:03,592
Damn. I know this is a trap.

24
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:04,947
Follow me.

25
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:14,758
Move out, huh?

26
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,667
<i>Delta One in position.</i>

27
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:18,955
<i>Copy, Delta One, we're a go.</i>

28
00:06:11,999 --> 00:06:13,398
Tunnel.

29
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:39,358
Russo, gun.

30
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:52,471
Remember, clean sweep.
Computers, maps and weapons.

31
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:27,953
Thank you.

32
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:49,476
Looks like we found some decent intel
on that laptop.

33
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:51,518
Dude got a Dell.

34
00:07:52,679 --> 00:07:54,192
I want you to know
you did real good down there.

35
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,593
Thanks, sir.

36
00:07:55,719 --> 00:07:58,358
In basic at Fort Bragg
I saw some great soldiers.

37
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,791
Moved up to the Delta, you are seeing the
finest warriors that history can produce.

38
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:06,594
Come to the 'Raq, and you are
seeing the best within the best.

39
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:09,517
And within that final elite group,
they all tied for second place

40
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:12,233
because you, my friend,
are a step ahead.

41
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:14,793
I want you to know
you did real good down there.

42
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:18,798
But from a command standpoint,
we cannot use you.

43
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,557
You take risk.
Going in without your gun drawn. Stupid.

44
00:08:24,119 --> 00:08:27,907
There's no need for a lone wolf who
pulls his unit into a hot situation.

45
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:30,155
You need to trust the man next to you,
exist within...

46
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:32,395
Exist within the command structure.
Yeah, I hear it every time.

47
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:36,228
Then write it down, Russo.
Write it on your eyelids.

48
00:08:36,359 --> 00:08:40,113
You think it's boring hearing this,
it is boring saying it.

49
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:45,352
You point, I fetch.
That's my job, but...

50
00:08:47,199 --> 00:08:49,076
That's all you want, fine.

51
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:52,153
Chopper's here. Let's move out.

52
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:04,514
Hi, Jim.
Thanks for coming
on such short notice.

53
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:05,628
Yes, sir.

54
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:07,715
- Have a seat.
- Thank you, sir.

55
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:19,796
I hate rescue operations.

56
00:09:21,119 --> 00:09:24,111
To rescue somebody means
the machine broke down,

57
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:27,631
and I don't like the other
team calling my plays.

58
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:32,792
And, thanks to you,
we have their playbook.

59
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:36,311
Because of that,
Allied Command sent me a rainmaker.

60
00:09:36,439 --> 00:09:40,830
WMDs, nuclear, biological, chemical.

61
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,917
Target the source, stop distribution.

62
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:48,635
Your Iraqi raid exposed a network that is
hell bent on acquiring these weapons.

63
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:52,311
Key money men, factory locations,

64
00:09:52,439 --> 00:09:56,352
most of which were in Europe,
but there is one in our neighbourhood.

65
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:05,512
Four hundred miles to the north,
the Belzan Forest in southern Russia,

66
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,709
specifically the Chechen Republic.

67
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,913
The Belzan Forest is impenetrable,
not even the Russians will touch it.

68
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:17,112
Locals believe it is a mythical beast,
easily woken.

69
00:10:17,239 --> 00:10:21,710
This is Katya Zemanova.
Counter-terrorism, psyops, tactics.

70
00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:34,831
Dr Benton Walsh. He was one of ours.
Employed by the Army for medical research,

71
00:10:35,319 --> 00:10:38,789
but when the President cut
stem cell funding, the Army let him go.

72
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:40,238
Now he's a fugitive.

73
00:10:40,359 --> 00:10:42,953
What? Wait a minute, she's on...
She's on our side?

74
00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:44,797
She's Agency.

75
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:49,356
I've been tracking the doctor for a
year through former Soviet states.

76
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,875
His science is weapons grade,
but he needs a sponsor.

77
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:58,395
On the hard drive you recovered
were references to a WMD doctor.

78
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:01,670
Coordinates are inside
the Belzan Forest.

79
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:04,632
The Chechen rebels are begging
to fund anyone

80
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:07,114
who can give them an ultimate weapon.

81
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:09,992
Drop a daisy cutter on that number
and problem solved.

82
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:11,871
We can't bomb Russian territory.

83
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,877
A Russian Spetsnaz team
has been sent into the area,

84
00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:17,638
we need to extract the doctor
before they do.

85
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:21,274
His research is too valuable
in anyone's hands but our own.

86
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:23,469
You're gonna need good men
in great numbers.

87
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,351
Quiet and small.

88
00:11:25,479 --> 00:11:29,791
Keep the winning percentage high.
One team, your Deltas.

89
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,558
Ms Zemanova will accompany
as an advisor.

90
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:38,954
Permission to speak candidly, sir?

91
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:45,037
It's denied,

92
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:47,798
but you are the commander
of this operation.

93
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:50,228
Bring this one home, Jim.

94
00:12:07,479 --> 00:12:11,267
Bearcat One, Bearcat One.
Who is it?

95
00:12:12,119 --> 00:12:14,155
<i>Didn't get a clear look.</i>

96
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:16,668
<i>Could be Keating. Not 100% on that.</i>

97
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,951
Yeah, that's Keating.

98
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:33,710
- Total FUBAR.
<i>- Ten-four, sir, are we go with Plan B?</i>

99
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,511
It's a go.

100
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:42,271
What? Whoa!

101
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:48,235
We got to put you
on a liquid diet, man.

102
00:12:48,359 --> 00:12:50,793
Can't have you dropping bombs like...

103
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:54,838
Russo. Man, I'm sorry. My bad.

104
00:12:57,599 --> 00:13:01,194
Downey, hey, Russo, stand down.

105
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:09,429
Russo, stand down.
Downey, stand down.

106
00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:11,872
Nice shot.

107
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:15,072
Russo, go have that
checked with the medic.

108
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:16,948
Yes, sir.

109
00:13:21,319 --> 00:13:22,957
I have noticed between missions

110
00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:27,072
that activity in this camp resembles
a Thai shore leave.

111
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:29,952
Shore leave are for sailors, soldiers.

112
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:34,508
Downey, you know
how I feel about sailors in my army.

113
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:35,794
Yes, sir.

114
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:38,479
I'm gonna give you a bit of advice,
Mr Popularity,

115
00:13:38,599 --> 00:13:41,477
you will never be a leader
rebuilding latrines,

116
00:13:41,599 --> 00:13:44,875
so why don't you just pick
three of these sailors to help you.

117
00:13:44,999 --> 00:13:46,148
Yes, sir.

118
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:04,878
Ten-hut.

119
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,107
Be seated.

120
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:12,317
Where's Downey?

121
00:14:12,439 --> 00:14:14,316
- Work duty, sir.
- Again?

122
00:14:14,439 --> 00:14:15,588
Yes, sir.

123
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:22,558
Who's the civilian?

124
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:26,797
Katya Zemanova, direct from Langley.
She'll be non-combatant.

125
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:28,671
Russo, combatant.

126
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:32,678
Our medic, Lieutenant O'Neal,
and my RTO.

127
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:35,472
Name's Candell, ma'am.
You can call me Can Do.

128
00:14:35,599 --> 00:14:37,669
- Right.
- And my right hand, my LTC.

129
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:39,471
Pleasure to meet you, ma'am.

130
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:44,796
All right, the Belzan Forest.

131
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:48,548
Heavy cloud coverage
makes satellite imaging impossible.

132
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:52,797
Thermals found a hot spot.
This'll be our target.

133
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,753
Expect unpredictable weather changes.

134
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:59,916
Tomorrow, 0830,
fast-rope insertion into the LZ,

135
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:04,237
two clicks by foot to the forest.
Expect RPGs and heavy resistance.

136
00:15:04,359 --> 00:15:05,508
When you step inside the Belzan,

137
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:09,154
know that you are entering a completely
unknown, hostile environment.

138
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,431
Dense foliage, open pockets,
a river, the rest is rumour.

139
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:17,552
It's bigger than New York City,
and more dangerous.

140
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:19,874
Our target is the doctor.

141
00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:24,277
Straightforward extraction, keep him alive.
All other hostiles eliminated.

142
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,436
Outline transit will
be a stolen Russian Mi-8.

143
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:30,517
Extraction point will be
the southern tip down here.

144
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,028
This is a town that survived
the first Chechen war.

145
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:35,957
It was abandoned
mysteriously one year ago.

146
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,752
The Russians used it as
a staging area, so will we.

147
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:40,870
Sir? Who are we shooting at?

148
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:44,830
Chances are Chechen rebels
have set up camp.

149
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,631
They'll do anything
to protect the doctor,

150
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:50,035
but we've also got a Russian Spetsnaz
team in the same theatre,

151
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:54,357
so rules of engagement apply.
This is not a fantasy league or video game.

152
00:15:54,479 --> 00:15:56,868
We will not run what-if scenarios
with Russia's elite.

153
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:59,149
Yeah, I'm talking to you, Russo.

154
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:03,948
Sir, you gotta admit, Delta Versus Spetsnaz,
that's a pretty cool video game.

155
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,194
Can it.

156
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:08,396
Anything you want to add?

157
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:12,154
Rebels normally
run in 10 man cadres,

158
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:15,396
but expect more spread out force
in the forest.

159
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,718
Count on them to fight, and keep fighting,
even after they've stopped breathing.

160
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,115
Look for pulled pins
and trip wires on bodies.

161
00:16:24,239 --> 00:16:26,833
Your death is their glory.

162
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,355
And on that, dismissed.

163
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,154
Colonel, so we're clear, not only
am I bringing a weapon on this mission,

164
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:42,235
I'm also trained to use it.

165
00:16:42,999 --> 00:16:45,877
I can take the
safety off and everything.

166
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,152
Understood.

167
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:55,468
And for the record,
I've never been to Langley.

168
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:59,228
And I'm not from any farm.
I trained in the field.

169
00:16:59,999 --> 00:17:03,708
With all due disrespect,
did we run out of Americans?

170
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,718
Because if we did, I'm sure there's
a few British chicks that can do the job.

171
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,718
I was born in Russia,
but I am also an American citizen.

172
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,307
I'm well versed in constitutional law.

173
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,429
And on the Fourth of July,
I like to blow things up.

174
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:22,715
Is that <i>Yankee Doodle Dandy</i>
enough for you, Colonel?

175
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:50,634
- You think they have gone?
- Why would they stay?

176
00:17:52,719 --> 00:17:55,756
You get the ammo, I will protect you.

177
00:17:57,999 --> 00:18:02,038
- I have position. You go.
- You cannot shoot.

178
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:05,868
- I shoot the same as you. You run faster.
- That's because you are fat.

179
00:18:05,999 --> 00:18:07,990
- I am not fat!
- You are fat!

180
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:22,432
You ate all your food already.

181
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:24,635
I will shoot you right here.

182
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:27,518
Okay, I'll go.

183
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,955
Why would they stay, right?

184
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:37,148
But next time, no shortcuts.

185
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:52,877
Dmitri?

186
00:19:23,199 --> 00:19:25,315
- Yeah.
- Did you get him?

187
00:19:25,439 --> 00:19:27,555
Yes, sir, double tap.

188
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,954
All right, well, here's your radio,
cowboy, fully juiced.

189
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:31,307
Thank you, sir.

190
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:35,355
Sir? I just want to tell you,
I'm glad you're on this op with us.

191
00:19:35,479 --> 00:19:36,434
What is it? My aftershave?

192
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,347
No, sir, it's just that you're the
only one that Russo listens to.

193
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:43,039
Maybe Captain Russo's
gonna surprise some of you guys this trip.

194
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:46,629
No, I hope not.
Surprise is the best form of attack, sir.

195
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:07,550
Downey, you lost, boy?

196
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,433
Colonel's orders. Something about
teaching you girls how to hunt.

197
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:16,032
- You good to go?
- Yeah. Ready.

198
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:24,358
CIA, Russian, woman. Triple threat.

199
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:29,071
- Sounds more like three strikes to me.
- Don't fall for foreign girls, Downey.

200
00:20:29,199 --> 00:20:30,757
They're human shields.

201
00:20:30,879 --> 00:20:32,437
The good news is about having two girls
on a mission...

202
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,552
- What's that?
- Closer drop. Save my feet.

203
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:39,398
- Are all Deltas such pansies?
- Not all.

204
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:42,716
- Hey, is that thing loaded?
- Yeah.

205
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:46,354
You know, in the Marines,
payback's called friendly fire.

206
00:20:46,999 --> 00:20:49,752
- Then I'm damn proud to be Delta.
- Yes, sir.

207
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:57,918
- Come on.
- Let's go, let's go, full capacity.

208
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:10,111
You still mad at me?

209
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:16,472
Tell you what, when we get back,
I'll bake you a bundt cake.

210
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:19,476
We're getting one of our own guys?

211
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:23,069
Was one of ours.
Better get him before anyone else does.

212
00:21:58,199 --> 00:22:01,748
- Okay, nap time's over.
- Two minutes. Two!

213
00:22:02,479 --> 00:22:04,037
Gear up.

214
00:22:30,959 --> 00:22:32,631
Let's go, move out.

215
00:22:52,959 --> 00:22:56,429
<i>- Radio check.</i>
<i>- Loud and clear.</i>

216
00:22:57,719 --> 00:23:01,473
<i>Roger, roger.</i>
<i>Martinez, any movement up ahead?</i>

217
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,552
<i>Nothing, Colonel.</i>

218
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:11,751
<i>Eyes open, everybody.</i>

219
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,715
<i>We're about ten clicks out...</i>

220
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:23,158
You hear that?

221
00:23:24,199 --> 00:23:25,552
What, sir?

222
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,592
Nothing.

223
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:32,076
No birds, no animals.

224
00:23:33,719 --> 00:23:35,038
Not even insects.

225
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:47,193
<i>- What the...</i>
<i>- Dead deer?</i>

226
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:49,597
<i>Deers don't wear uniforms.</i>

227
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,198
<i>Easy.</i>

228
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,478
<i>Man, that looks like...</i>

229
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:58,716
<i>Whatever it is, it looks like</i>
<i>it's been chewed up and spit out.</i>

230
00:24:02,719 --> 00:24:04,277
What we got here?

231
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:12,310
It's hard to say, sir. Whoever this was
got completely blown apart.

232
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:14,510
Dead three or four days.

233
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:18,038
Where's the blast damage?
The grenade fragments?

234
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,957
Kalashnikovs on the ground,
brand new AKs.

235
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:25,917
Sir, these boys panicked.
They were shooting in every direction.

236
00:24:29,639 --> 00:24:32,870
Well trained in any terrain.
The units rotated constantly, the elite.

237
00:24:32,999 --> 00:24:34,830
Chechens didn't do this.

238
00:24:35,439 --> 00:24:39,478
Then what, then?
Bears? Stalin's ghost?

239
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,794
Let's move,
still got some ground to cover.

240
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:47,114
Heads up, eyes open.

241
00:25:04,999 --> 00:25:08,116
- You don't mind, do you?
- You take the bullet.

242
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:34,078
Clear.

243
00:25:38,879 --> 00:25:40,392
Russo, gun.

244
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,433
Clear.

245
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:06,911
What have we got here?

246
00:26:09,639 --> 00:26:13,154
Besides the stench,
probably a weapons testing facility.

247
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:15,355
Some of the doc's early work.

248
00:26:16,719 --> 00:26:18,391
Check out this gear.

249
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:23,750
- Daddy likes to watch.
- Yeah, I can see that.

250
00:26:23,879 --> 00:26:26,552
- Candell, check the radio.
- Yes, sir.

251
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,712
- Russian Army, new issue.
- Probably stolen.

252
00:26:35,639 --> 00:26:39,552
- What have you got?
- Nothing, nothing but static.

253
00:26:43,879 --> 00:26:45,870
Looks like troop movements.

254
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:52,037
Yeah, maybe,
but this coordinate is right there.

255
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:04,953
Clear.

256
00:27:07,879 --> 00:27:09,915
Don't let your guard down.

257
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:15,473
I got this.

258
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:38,278
- So your boy's a birdwatcher?
- No feathers, no birds.

259
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,759
- Bats.
- Bats did this?

260
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:47,636
And I'll bet that's what fed
on the bodies we found.

261
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:52,397
- He was strapped in.
- What have you got?

262
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:55,829
- Another body and bats.
- Bats?

263
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:59,797
Did she say bats?

264
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:15,797
Man, I'm telling you,
bats don't eat meat. They don't.

265
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:18,638
- Move out.
- Candell, back me up on this, man.

266
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:20,590
Bugs and fruit as far as I know.

267
00:28:20,719 --> 00:28:23,517
Shoot, there was a colony up there
at the school I went to in Austin.

268
00:28:23,639 --> 00:28:27,268
Me and my girlfriend used to sit up there on
the Congress Avenue Bridge, drink beers,

269
00:28:27,399 --> 00:28:31,358
watch them fly around all night.
Hell, she thought they were cute.

270
00:29:00,199 --> 00:29:04,112
- He's right, they are cute.
- Hold that thing up to the tree.

271
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:13,909
- Flying chameleon?
- Meat-eating flying chameleon.

272
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:19,671
- Check this out. Blends in with the tree.
- I'll bet that's what got the Spetsnaz.

273
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:43,674
You don't really believe
those tales, do you?

274
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:46,597
If you make a joke of it,
you'll be cursed.

275
00:29:46,719 --> 00:29:52,271
Don't be silly. You don't believe setting foot
into the forest would actually get us killed.

276
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:56,438
If we don't get through the forest before
it gets dark, then we'll be in danger.

277
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,993
No. We must go around.

278
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:02,194
Wait a minute.
I'll prove it to you.

279
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:10,753
If what you were saying was true,
I would be dead by now.

280
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:16,149
Enough with the silly
superstitious, let's go.

281
00:30:19,199 --> 00:30:21,235
It must be the birds.

282
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:51,309
Why were you running?

283
00:31:07,239 --> 00:31:09,355
- Downey, get up there.
- Yes, sir.

284
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:17,832
What's a beautiful woman like you
leading Deltas in a place like this?

285
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:26,391
Colonel wants you to hang back,
Russo has point.

286
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:31,468
Which do you think means more to me?
The men or the mission?

287
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:37,992
- Definitely not men.
- Good, then we can agree on one thing.

288
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:41,075
You're a means to an end.

289
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:44,430
You got this cute little
anger thing going. I like it.

290
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:48,114
- You have a problem, too?
- With what?

291
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,548
- With Russian women.
- With Russian women?

292
00:31:50,679 --> 00:31:53,318
God, no. I hate the Agency.

293
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:12,592
I once read that Spartans,
the greatest warriors on the planet,

294
00:32:12,719 --> 00:32:14,869
used to sing as they
marched into battle,

295
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:17,877
top of their lungs
to freak out their enemies.

296
00:32:17,999 --> 00:32:21,753
- What army did you sign up for?
- I'm a student of warfare, man.

297
00:32:21,879 --> 00:32:23,870
Singing relaxed them.

298
00:32:23,999 --> 00:32:27,275
- Most of the battle takes place in your mind.
- Yeah?

299
00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:30,197
I'll tell your folks at your funeral.

300
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:54,472
Russo, hold your fire. Russo!

301
00:32:56,439 --> 00:33:00,148
You were lucky, don't be stupid. O'Neal!
Now let the doc take a look at you.

302
00:33:05,639 --> 00:33:07,072
- Twelve degrees north.
- How many out there?

303
00:33:07,199 --> 00:33:09,190
- At least two!
- Lay down cover fire.

304
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:11,469
I can cross that
distance in seven seconds.

305
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:19,030
Russo, damn it. Why don't you just
take control of your man?

306
00:33:19,159 --> 00:33:21,434
Colonel, Downey and I will flank
the second shooter.

307
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:22,787
- Roger that.
- But, sir...

308
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:25,991
Russo, cover your eyelids
and read the message.

309
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:27,074
Go!

310
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:36,707
All right, Russo, one shot.
When you have it, take it.

311
00:33:53,319 --> 00:33:54,911
Clear.

312
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:58,952
- This one's been fed on as well.
- Jeez.

313
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:02,635
Same Spetsnaz team.

314
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,955
I want answers.
Full disclosure.

315
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:13,832
Will it make you run any faster,
shoot any better?

316
00:34:13,959 --> 00:34:17,269
Listen, lady, we just gave cause
for World War III. Who's out there?

317
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:21,028
- I don't know.
- Another bat victim?

318
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:24,278
He wouldn't have
lived the hour, Colonel.

319
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:27,198
Looks like we just
averted World War III.

320
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,788
Move out.

321
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:36,234
- How do you feel?
- I feel good.

322
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,953
I should probably stop
trying to picture her naked.

323
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,991
No doubt.
Chick will take you to hell and back.

324
00:35:23,999 --> 00:35:27,150
You often travel the Belzan pass?

325
00:35:27,279 --> 00:35:29,509
No more than is needed.

326
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:32,676
Been witness to any strange events?

327
00:35:33,319 --> 00:35:36,675
- Like two farmers forced onto a truck?
- Even stranger.

328
00:35:36,799 --> 00:35:39,393
Have you seen anyone in the woods?

329
00:35:44,399 --> 00:35:47,038
- You know of us?
- We know nothing.

330
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:49,912
- We see nothing.
- You've seen me.

331
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:54,877
Answer truthfully.

332
00:35:56,799 --> 00:36:00,348
Two days ago patrol went missing
along the pass.

333
00:36:00,479 --> 00:36:03,789
- Tell me who did it.
- We know nothing. Please believe us.

334
00:36:03,919 --> 00:36:06,911
- Why do you protect the rebels?
- We do not.

335
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:10,268
Nobody goes into the Belzan.

336
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:13,874
What goes on in there?

337
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:20,389
Our sheep go missing, then villagers.
You get too close, you go missing, too.

338
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:22,747
Unlikely.

339
00:36:33,439 --> 00:36:37,557
Sound the call. The whole battalion
prepped and ready in one hour.

340
00:36:55,719 --> 00:36:57,198
<i>Russo, you copy?</i>

341
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,398
Affirmative.

342
00:37:01,279 --> 00:37:03,076
<i>Where the hell are you?</i>

343
00:37:04,359 --> 00:37:06,190
Staring at a power line

344
00:37:06,799 --> 00:37:09,233
half a click from the first sniper.

345
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:12,993
<i>- Coming to you.</i>
- Copy that.

346
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:31,151
Martinez!

347
00:37:35,479 --> 00:37:37,310
No. Colonel.

348
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:52,467
Delta Force, welcome to the party.

349
00:37:57,679 --> 00:37:59,351
Russo, what happened?

350
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:02,353
Soldier.

351
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:07,029
Ounce of C4 under a pressure plate,
or a tripwire.

352
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:09,468
Trees are marked like minefields.

353
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,636
Either way, Martinez is gone.

354
00:38:18,439 --> 00:38:20,350
There's that sound again.

355
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:29,511
- What did you see out there?
- Nothing.

356
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:32,073
This is rebel territory, it's a trap.

357
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:37,755
Yeah, well, trap or not

358
00:38:39,439 --> 00:38:41,316
that's our destination.

359
00:38:41,439 --> 00:38:43,999
Hot spot coordinates
are in those trees.

360
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:50,114
All right, single file.
I got point.

361
00:39:30,439 --> 00:39:31,713
Wait for my...

362
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:48,192
This is it.

363
00:39:50,759 --> 00:39:51,874
Colonel.

364
00:40:09,399 --> 00:40:10,627
Get down!

365
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:22,909
- Colonel!
- Move, move, move.

366
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:52,434
Go, go, go, go, move!

367
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:29,787
Go, go.

368
00:41:36,959 --> 00:41:38,597
Don't look, go, go!

369
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:09,076
Rebels, but no bats, go this way.
I got O'Neal.

370
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:14,237
Tell those men to stand down,
but keep the Americans in sight.

371
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:27,308
Okay.

372
00:42:42,999 --> 00:42:45,433
Candell, Candell.

373
00:42:45,559 --> 00:42:47,595
You all get out of here,
I got this.

374
00:42:51,999 --> 00:42:53,591
Fire in the hole!

375
00:43:00,519 --> 00:43:01,554
Candell!

376
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:03,078
- No.
- No!

377
00:43:10,999 --> 00:43:13,718
- What happened? Where'd they go?
- I don't know.

378
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:16,399
Wait a minute, wait a minute. I'm getting
something, I'm getting something.

379
00:43:16,519 --> 00:43:20,353
Echo Two-Five, come in.
Echo Two-Five, say again.

380
00:43:21,399 --> 00:43:24,550
<i>- We lost Candell.</i>
- Candell didn't make it.

381
00:43:32,279 --> 00:43:35,157
Yankee Three-Four,
this is Echo Two-Six, over.

382
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:39,517
Yankee Three-Four, this is Echo Two-Six,
emergency situation, over.

383
00:43:39,639 --> 00:43:40,992
Here, drink some water.

384
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:45,317
- Can't reach base camp without the radio.
- Candell is gone, radio's gone.

385
00:43:46,519 --> 00:43:47,554
- Downey.
- Yankee Three-Four,

386
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:49,635
this is Echo Two-Six, over.

387
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:54,078
Work within the system,
bunch of crap.

388
00:43:58,359 --> 00:43:59,872
Watch your back.

389
00:44:03,759 --> 00:44:06,273
O'Neal won't make the base camp,
her wounds are too deep.

390
00:44:06,399 --> 00:44:08,515
Well, we need to call in a medevac,
get her evaced immediately.

391
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:10,834
There's no time for that.
She's slowing us down already.

392
00:44:10,959 --> 00:44:13,951
- Just what do you suggest?
- Make a tough decision.

393
00:44:14,799 --> 00:44:16,596
I don't know what
they teach you at Langley,

394
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:20,997
but O'Neal's as tough as they come.
She'll make it until we say otherwise.

395
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:28,516
O'Neal's in bad shape.

396
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:31,437
Extraction's an hour after sunset,
but she needs an evac now.

397
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:34,198
We're not going anywhere.
Right now we're the experiment.

398
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:37,117
- Hey, what about O'Neal?
- What about Martinez?

399
00:44:37,239 --> 00:44:38,991
You think I'll leave here
without popping the doctor?

400
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:41,349
Look, we've seen bats, Chechens.

401
00:44:41,479 --> 00:44:43,549
Count on a strong Russian response
from the team they lost.

402
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:45,351
Russians find us, we're dead.

403
00:44:45,479 --> 00:44:48,835
There's no room for revenge, man.
It's the system.

404
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:51,436
We're Delta, act like it.

405
00:44:52,399 --> 00:44:53,878
You giving orders now?

406
00:44:53,999 --> 00:44:56,911
After Martinez and the Colonel,
I am ranking officer.

407
00:44:57,039 --> 00:44:59,678
That and $20 will get you a happy ending.

408
00:45:00,399 --> 00:45:02,594
We're still getting the doctor.

409
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:44,876
We can't find them, sir.
What do we do?

410
00:45:44,999 --> 00:45:49,709
How was life in America?
Your early years, the formative ones?

411
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:55,274
- I've never been to America.
- That's right, that's me.

412
00:45:56,519 --> 00:45:59,397
And you never went to medical school,
did you?

413
00:46:00,479 --> 00:46:01,594
No.

414
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:05,310
You were born about 30 miles
from these woods.

415
00:46:05,439 --> 00:46:08,909
Trained to hunt and shoot
before you ever saw a television.

416
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:14,231
You couldn't tell a polypeptide
from haemoglobin.

417
00:46:16,119 --> 00:46:20,271
Yet you think I'm better suited
to advise on military matters,

418
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:23,635
on search and destroy,

419
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:27,948
on the very thing you're paid to do.

420
00:46:29,159 --> 00:46:31,593
They've slipped off the map.

421
00:46:32,919 --> 00:46:34,637
We'll find them, sir.

422
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:37,358
Good.

423
00:46:37,479 --> 00:46:40,198
I'd hate to have to
breed your replacement.

424
00:46:51,439 --> 00:46:53,953
No way of telling how many are inside.

425
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:57,478
Let's move.

426
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:01,274
Katya, O'Neal, hold position here
and lay down supporting fire.

427
00:47:02,759 --> 00:47:06,149
Take the two to the east. I'll clear
an extraction path on the west side.

428
00:47:06,279 --> 00:47:08,747
- Who gets the doctor?
- Stay here.

429
00:47:10,039 --> 00:47:12,075
You cover us.

430
00:49:17,759 --> 00:49:23,117
Doctor Benton Walsh, you are now
property of the United States of America.

431
00:49:27,959 --> 00:49:29,551
Let's move.

432
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:39,750
Where are they?

433
00:49:40,479 --> 00:49:42,947
Come on. Get the move on.

434
00:49:55,039 --> 00:49:56,631
You ready to move?

435
00:49:57,639 --> 00:49:59,152
Okay, I got you.

436
00:50:04,439 --> 00:50:06,395
As much R&D as I could find.

437
00:50:06,519 --> 00:50:09,397
These rebels are loaded.
Guns, grenades, C4.

438
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:12,352
They got a WMD hardware store back there,
but none of the pieces fit.

439
00:50:12,479 --> 00:50:16,518
Rocket casings, triggers, fuel cells.
Whole bunch of almost, but not quite.

440
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:18,834
They bought anything
they could get their hands on.

441
00:50:18,959 --> 00:50:21,393
Yeah? How much were you?

442
00:50:30,759 --> 00:50:32,989
The bats are coming back,
we need to get inside.

443
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:34,837
Get ready to move out.

444
00:50:36,959 --> 00:50:38,551
Save it.

445
00:50:38,679 --> 00:50:40,909
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Yes, you are.

446
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:43,997
I can't feel my legs.
I can't stand up.

447
00:50:45,279 --> 00:50:49,557
- What part of that sounds like I can walk?
- You'll lean on me like before.

448
00:50:50,399 --> 00:50:53,436
Do I have to spell it out for you?
I'm dead.

449
00:50:53,559 --> 00:50:55,948
The clock ran out on me an hour ago.

450
00:50:56,719 --> 00:50:58,789
I'll cover you.
When you get back just tell them...

451
00:50:58,919 --> 00:51:01,831
Listen, lady, I go back without you
and Downey rolls a grenade in my tent,

452
00:51:01,959 --> 00:51:05,998
and I'm sure as hell not staying here.
Now get on your feet and move.

453
00:51:07,399 --> 00:51:08,434
Move.

454
00:51:10,039 --> 00:51:10,994
All right.

455
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:15,910
Echo One-Five, do you copy?
Echo One-Five, come in.

456
00:51:18,519 --> 00:51:20,271
What's causing the interference?

457
00:51:20,399 --> 00:51:22,959
- The sequence is still running.
- Shut it down.

458
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:26,515
If you shut down the computer,
you lose control of the experiment.

459
00:51:26,639 --> 00:51:30,427
- You take off the leash.
- Don't care, as long as it saves my team.

460
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:32,918
Suit yourself.

461
00:52:15,439 --> 00:52:18,749
You killed my only friend.
That means you're gonna die.

462
00:52:18,879 --> 00:52:21,518
Without me you won't get within a mile
of your rendezvous.

463
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:22,628
Hey!

464
00:52:23,879 --> 00:52:26,791
- We don't have time for this.
- Then make time!

465
00:52:26,919 --> 00:52:29,991
I'll get you out.
I can direct you away from the bats.

466
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:34,317
- Why should we believe anything you say?
- Because you and I want to live.

467
00:52:35,879 --> 00:52:37,551
We lost O'Neal, man.

468
00:52:38,599 --> 00:52:40,430
It's time to saddle up.

469
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:57,031
Take the intel.
He's coming with us.

470
00:52:57,159 --> 00:52:59,275
- Are you crazy?
- This man is my prisoner.

471
00:52:59,399 --> 00:53:02,277
You keep him alive,
zero chance of making it.

472
00:53:02,399 --> 00:53:05,197
You think if he got free,
he wouldn't gut you in a second?

473
00:53:05,319 --> 00:53:07,275
- I need my hands.
- Negative.

474
00:53:10,119 --> 00:53:12,428
What happens to me happens to you.

475
00:53:35,559 --> 00:53:36,628
Whoa.

476
00:53:39,079 --> 00:53:41,752
There's just a few,
you're probably safe.

477
00:53:42,919 --> 00:53:45,956
- Downey, transport carrier.
- Let's take it, move.

478
00:54:29,639 --> 00:54:31,152
Katya.

479
00:54:44,199 --> 00:54:45,234
Keys.

480
00:54:59,799 --> 00:55:01,198
Freaking bats.

481
00:55:27,439 --> 00:55:29,111
Colonel Korkov!

482
00:55:29,239 --> 00:55:30,991
- Colonel Korkov...
- Read it to me.

483
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:33,394
Radar station detected an abrupt
change in radio interference

484
00:55:33,519 --> 00:55:34,872
- around the Belzan Forest.
- Changed how?

485
00:55:34,999 --> 00:55:36,591
It's gone.

486
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:39,429
They triangulated the origin.

487
00:55:44,119 --> 00:55:45,598
Good luck, sir.

488
00:55:47,759 --> 00:55:50,512
- What is it?
- Good news.

489
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:11,911
They're gone.

490
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:20,228
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah, fine.

491
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:28,510
- What do you see? You see anything?
- Only trees.

492
00:56:29,319 --> 00:56:31,230
And no bats.

493
00:56:43,759 --> 00:56:45,397
I read your dossier.

494
00:56:46,879 --> 00:56:50,667
Born in America,
schooled in America,

495
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:52,471
employed by America.

496
00:56:54,239 --> 00:56:56,673
Sounds like a pretty good deal to me.

497
00:56:57,679 --> 00:57:00,068
America makes very good killers.

498
00:57:00,879 --> 00:57:02,756
And not even a thank you.

499
00:57:03,399 --> 00:57:05,788
Tell me, Doc, what did we do to you?

500
00:57:06,479 --> 00:57:08,674
What did America do to me?

501
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:10,357
Lied.

502
00:57:11,239 --> 00:57:15,118
We say every man
has basic human rights.

503
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:21,193
No. You have the right to nothing.
The world belongs to the strong.

504
00:57:22,279 --> 00:57:23,837
That's how it works,

505
00:57:23,959 --> 00:57:27,110
that's the natural order.

506
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:28,998
<i>Downey, Downey,</i>

507
00:57:30,479 --> 00:57:32,197
coming up on a fence.

508
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:37,318
Fence?

509
00:57:37,959 --> 00:57:39,278
Keep going.

510
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:42,675
- Keep going.
- Roger that.

511
00:57:44,719 --> 00:57:47,597
- You might want to buckle up.
- This truck is Russian,

512
00:57:47,719 --> 00:57:49,835
they don't have any seatbelts.

513
00:57:56,959 --> 00:57:58,392
Don't you move.

514
00:58:11,759 --> 00:58:13,158
What the heck?

515
00:58:18,839 --> 00:58:20,636
Why'd we stop?

516
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:23,074
Yeah, we have some sort of visual
out in the front blocking the truck.

517
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:25,997
<i>- Roger, let's check it out.</i>
- Copy.

518
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:37,669
This shouldn't have happened.

519
00:58:38,519 --> 00:58:42,273
- What the hell's this?
- Another great moment in science.

520
00:58:42,399 --> 00:58:46,870
- These are ours, our food supply.
- Dead less than 24 hours.

521
00:58:48,279 --> 00:58:50,952
You did this.
You interrupted the sequence.

522
00:58:51,079 --> 00:58:54,674
Face it, Doc. Your control is
slipping, or you never had it.

523
00:58:55,159 --> 00:58:56,558
Cover, cover!

524
00:59:00,599 --> 00:59:02,032
Let the doctor go!

525
00:59:02,879 --> 00:59:04,392
What, Russians?

526
00:59:05,719 --> 00:59:09,678
- Chechens. Patrol by the river.
- You lead us into an ambush.

527
00:59:09,799 --> 00:59:12,359
- I thought Deltas were the best.
- Shut up.

528
00:59:12,479 --> 00:59:17,348
- They're moving, trying to flank us.
- All right, we pull back.

529
00:59:17,479 --> 00:59:20,630
Pull back.
Russo, the mission has priority.

530
00:59:20,759 --> 00:59:24,798
My priority is killing the enemy,
whoever they might be at the moment.

531
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:10,307
Can't go left, can't go right.
Can't go back.

532
01:00:10,959 --> 01:00:13,189
- We're being herded.
- Let's move.

533
01:00:18,279 --> 01:00:20,474
Russo, let's move out on my six.

534
01:00:27,399 --> 01:00:29,071
Do you know who I am?

535
01:00:31,319 --> 01:00:33,879
I'm the one who find your hiding place

536
01:00:33,999 --> 01:00:35,148
in Kiev.

537
01:00:37,439 --> 01:00:39,111
The bomb you left

538
01:00:40,799 --> 01:00:42,391
killed a good man.

539
01:00:44,439 --> 01:00:48,591
I hope you were close, 'cause you're
going to see him very soon.

540
01:00:55,879 --> 01:00:57,278
Downey, stop!

541
01:00:59,439 --> 01:01:00,952
What?

542
01:01:01,079 --> 01:01:03,354
Marked for a reason.

543
01:01:04,919 --> 01:01:07,228
We're Delta, act like it.

544
01:01:09,439 --> 01:01:11,031
Thanks.

545
01:01:12,279 --> 01:01:14,110
Don't let them get away!

546
01:01:19,319 --> 01:01:20,877
Russo, take point.

547
01:01:29,559 --> 01:01:32,471
- Damn it.
- Right back to the cage.

548
01:01:32,599 --> 01:01:34,635
He turned us around.

549
01:01:34,759 --> 01:01:38,434
- It's Candell.
- No, no, hey! He's dead. Let it go.

550
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:41,312
- Where are the bats?
- They're here.

551
01:01:45,479 --> 01:01:47,674
Listen, I have an idea.

552
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:24,114
Bats got this one.
Find the rest.

553
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:30,555
- Careful. Careful!
- Move in slowly.

554
01:02:54,599 --> 01:02:56,590
That worked.

555
01:03:11,519 --> 01:03:13,749
Past the trees, half a mile.

556
01:03:15,439 --> 01:03:18,829
I don't know.
I think it's past the trees, a half mile.

557
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:31,717
- Delta Base, this is...
- How well do you know this woman?

558
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:34,399
- Come in.
- Better than you.

559
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:38,353
Watch her. She never lets the
briefcase out of her sight.

560
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:42,318
- Planting the seeds of doubt, huh?
- Delta Base, come in.

561
01:03:42,439 --> 01:03:47,194
There's not a government in the world that
wouldn't kill us for what's in that case.

562
01:03:47,999 --> 01:03:49,557
You hear anything?

563
01:03:50,599 --> 01:03:52,590
Low level chatter.

564
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:55,518
Sometimes it's used to
mask a big operation.

565
01:03:56,039 --> 01:03:58,507
Sometimes it's just
low level chatter.

566
01:03:59,079 --> 01:04:00,592
Well, good news,

567
01:04:01,319 --> 01:04:03,628
hour after sunset,
this is all in the rearview mirror.

568
01:04:03,759 --> 01:04:05,158
Let's move out.

569
01:04:20,839 --> 01:04:21,954
Russo.

570
01:04:22,879 --> 01:04:23,994
Russo?

571
01:04:26,399 --> 01:04:28,071
Go, go, go, go, go.

572
01:04:35,239 --> 01:04:36,388
Downey.

573
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:04,514
Clear.

574
01:05:06,839 --> 01:05:08,238
Sit him down.

575
01:05:14,879 --> 01:05:17,188
- All clear.
- Okay, we hold here.

576
01:05:17,879 --> 01:05:20,347
- I'm gonna set the beacon.
- Roger that.

577
01:05:22,679 --> 01:05:25,273
<i>Rescue Three-Five,</i>
<i>we have a beacon signal.</i>

578
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:29,355
Roger, base, beacon clear.
Moving toward extraction.

579
01:05:49,199 --> 01:05:51,315
Do spies get bonuses?

580
01:05:53,639 --> 01:05:55,152
It's classified.

581
01:05:56,359 --> 01:06:00,796
Maybe I'm in the wrong service.
This teamwork stuff sucks.

582
01:06:00,919 --> 01:06:03,558
You're more the lone wolf type.

583
01:06:03,679 --> 01:06:08,309
Drop me in Afghanistan before 9/11,
the world would be a different place.

584
01:06:08,439 --> 01:06:10,907
So you depend on time travel.

585
01:06:11,679 --> 01:06:12,873
It helps.

586
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:15,797
I like working alone.

587
01:06:17,719 --> 01:06:22,509
It took 14 months, two dozen agents
and a Delta team to bring in Walsh.

588
01:06:22,639 --> 01:06:25,836
He's a tough man to catch,
and not for lack of good intel.

589
01:06:25,959 --> 01:06:28,951
In the end we got lucky.
You never work alone.

590
01:06:32,359 --> 01:06:35,874
- Where's Downey?
- Setting the beacon. Marking the LZ.

591
01:06:35,999 --> 01:06:37,990
- Relax.
- I'll relax when we land at base camp.

592
01:06:38,119 --> 01:06:40,030
He has a history of escape.

593
01:06:40,159 --> 01:06:43,196
Look. Head down, shoulders slumped.

594
01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:46,116
That's a man
who knows he's been captured.

595
01:06:46,239 --> 01:06:48,628
That's when he's the most dangerous.

596
01:07:26,919 --> 01:07:30,229
- Russo, do you copy?
<i>- Copy, over.</i>

597
01:07:30,359 --> 01:07:32,509
Clear here, coming back to you.

598
01:07:38,799 --> 01:07:41,836
It appears you have
me at a disadvantage.

599
01:07:47,799 --> 01:07:50,552
We've never met,
but you know all about me.

600
01:07:51,319 --> 01:07:54,709
Then you should know that
I'm not coming back to America,

601
01:07:55,239 --> 01:07:57,195
that better men have tried.

602
01:07:57,679 --> 01:08:01,831
You know that these men will
die unless you release me.

603
01:08:03,399 --> 01:08:06,675
The man you killed was a damn
fine agent and my mentor.

604
01:08:08,359 --> 01:08:11,396
And one day in May,
he would have been my husband.

605
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:16,996
Goodbye, Doctor.

606
01:08:25,599 --> 01:08:27,829
- Next time, be on time.
- Yes, sir.

607
01:08:28,999 --> 01:08:30,990
Helicopters on the way, sir.

608
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:35,556
Thank you for your escort.

609
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:40,514
I leave you to your reunion with
the motherland, Agent Katya Zemanova.

610
01:08:41,519 --> 01:08:42,918
It will be a short one.

611
01:08:48,439 --> 01:08:51,636
- Where's the other Delta?
- I thought he was with you.

612
01:09:16,039 --> 01:09:19,076
<i>They're headed right for us!</i>
<i>Bank left! Bank left!</i>

613
01:09:37,039 --> 01:09:38,677
Downey!

614
01:09:50,159 --> 01:09:52,150
I got him. I got him. Go!

615
01:10:25,959 --> 01:10:27,233
I got you.

616
01:10:44,119 --> 01:10:45,757
Hand the case over.

617
01:10:49,559 --> 01:10:51,117
I don't think so.

618
01:10:54,839 --> 01:10:57,592
Born and bred to crave all blood,

619
01:10:57,719 --> 01:10:59,038
except mine.

620
01:10:59,959 --> 01:11:02,154
A little DNA for my own safety.

621
01:11:03,399 --> 01:11:05,594
You can stay and die,

622
01:11:06,599 --> 01:11:08,078
or you can run.

623
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:10,791
Run for your life.

624
01:11:14,439 --> 01:11:17,272
Since we're gonna
destroy the intel anyway,

625
01:11:19,279 --> 01:11:21,998
two for one.
This is for Martinez.

626
01:12:00,119 --> 01:12:02,679
<i>This is tower
confirming beacon status.</i>

627
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:07,348
Roger, tower, beacon unchanged.
Moving in towards extraction.

628
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:17,109
I guess he's not coming back.

629
01:12:18,599 --> 01:12:21,067
- How bad is he?
- It's not looking good.

630
01:12:21,719 --> 01:12:25,871
He's in and out of consciousness.
He needs a medevac right away.

631
01:12:25,999 --> 01:12:28,115
Extraction team's already en route.

632
01:12:28,239 --> 01:12:29,672
- It's the best I can do.
- By air?

633
01:12:29,799 --> 01:12:32,074
Did you see what happened
to the last helicopter?

634
01:12:32,199 --> 01:12:35,396
- What else you got? We got any more mags?
- No.

635
01:12:35,519 --> 01:12:37,157
What are you thinking?

636
01:12:37,279 --> 01:12:39,793
I'm gonna go back to the lab,
turn on the computer

637
01:12:39,919 --> 01:12:43,275
and call the bats back.
Blow the place to kingdom come.

638
01:12:43,399 --> 01:12:45,037
You're not serious.

639
01:12:45,159 --> 01:12:48,151
If I don't, nobody goes home.

640
01:12:48,279 --> 01:12:50,839
The Russians are coming.
If you're lucky, you'll go to prison.

641
01:12:50,959 --> 01:12:55,350
- Most likely you'll be shot as a spy on sight.
- I told you teamwork sucks.

642
01:12:55,479 --> 01:12:58,835
Don't wait for me, I'll find my way out.
That's an order.

643
01:12:59,639 --> 01:13:03,154
Wait, this is suicide.
What makes you think you'll make it?

644
01:13:03,959 --> 01:13:05,756
Bats bounce off me.

645
01:13:28,399 --> 01:13:32,153
- Air power will take hit.
- I want troops on the ground now.

646
01:13:32,279 --> 01:13:35,191
We missed the battle.
I will not miss the war.

647
01:15:25,279 --> 01:15:26,314
Boom.

648
01:16:08,639 --> 01:16:11,199
- Is this it?
- There's one more out there.

649
01:16:12,959 --> 01:16:16,838
We gotta go. Russians are inbound.
They're coming right at us.

650
01:16:16,959 --> 01:16:19,712
We need to get back
to the lab to get Russo.

651
01:19:56,279 --> 01:19:57,268
Name!

652
01:19:58,479 --> 01:19:59,548
Why is Delta here?

653
01:20:00,759 --> 01:20:04,832
I know the U.S. is
bringing back the rebels

654
01:20:04,959 --> 01:20:07,792
working with the doctor.
Dirty pig.

655
01:20:11,639 --> 01:20:15,393
I don't think your
country will miss you.

656
01:20:16,239 --> 01:20:17,308
So smart?

657
01:20:19,639 --> 01:20:20,992
Take him away.

658
01:20:52,359 --> 01:20:54,827
<i>Armed Forces Television</i>
<i>has intercepted the broadcast</i>

659
01:20:54,959 --> 01:20:58,918
<i>of a debriefing of Russian forces who</i>
<i>lead a raid on a terrorist stronghold.</i>

660
01:20:59,039 --> 01:21:03,237
<i>- Here's Paul James with a special report.</i>
<i>- Russian troops located and destroyed</i>

661
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:05,827
<i>- a biological weapons laboratory...</i>
- What a load of crap.

662
01:21:05,959 --> 01:21:08,598
Hey, welcome back, soldier.

663
01:21:08,719 --> 01:21:10,869
That's the problem
with secret missions.

664
01:21:10,999 --> 01:21:14,196
The better you do them,
the less the world knows about it.

665
01:21:14,319 --> 01:21:15,718
Did we?

666
01:21:15,839 --> 01:21:17,158
The mission.

667
01:21:17,839 --> 01:21:19,557
We did it, right?

668
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:22,352
Doctor's dead.
You're not.

669
01:21:22,479 --> 01:21:24,007
Mission
accomplished.
