Hi, Grandma,
you were just on TV.

I hope they captured

No, "Les Miserables."

225
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:48,281
Hmm, well, I guess
it could be worse.

226
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:50,083
It could be
"Lady Chatterley's Lover."

I can't expect you
not to be sad, sweetheart,

235
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:12,973
but to stay locked
in your room

236
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,743

and night reading,
it really worries me.

00:33:59,471 --> 00:34:01,607
Now do you
have dirty undies?

687
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,275
Man, you are mean to me.

688
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,682
Hayley: Little dog.

689
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,189
<i>Hey, Hayley, you awake?</i>
<i>What's going on?</i>

690
00:34:18,824 --> 00:34:20,892
Hey, dog, come here.

691
00:34:20,926 --> 00:34:22,261
<i>Hey, kid, what's up?</i>

692
00:34:22,294 --> 00:34:23,829
Come on,
I got something for you.

693
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:25,931
<i>-Really?</i>
<i>-[metal door opens]</i>

694
00:34:25,964 --> 00:34:29,235
<i>-Uh-oh.</i>
-Remember me?

<i>[screams]</i>

696
00:34:35,241 --> 00:34:36,908
<i>Huh? Oh.</i>

697
00:34:36,942 --> 00:34:39,845
<i>I got to lay off</i>
<i>that spicy cat food</i>
<i>before bed.</i>

698
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,681
<i>Seems nice and quiet.</i>

699

<i>-Sleeping like a baby.</i>
-[creaking]

700
00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:48,620
<i>I heard that.</i>

701
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:52,224
<i>Someone's up</i>
<i>in the attic.</i>

702
00:35:07,306 --> 00:35:09,841
<i>Hey, look,</i>

703
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:11,643
<i>Hmm, don't know</i>

704
00:35:13,412 --> 00:35:14,946
<i>Ahh, the kite.</i>

705
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,683
<i>Oh-ho, a scuba tank.</i>

706
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:19,718
<i>Maybe we can go</i>
<i>scuba diving someday.</i>

707
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:21,220
<i>Hey, what's this?</i>

708
00:35:21,253 --> 00:35:22,821
<i>"Private: Keep out."</i>

709
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:24,490
<i>Sounds like</i>
<i>an invitation to me.</i>

710
00:35:24,523 --> 00:35:27,058
<i>One more time.</i>
<i>One more time.</i>

711
00:35:27,092 --> 00:35:29,495
<i>Little help.</i>
<i>Little help.</i>

712
00:35:29,528 --> 00:35:31,830
<i>One more time.</i>
<i>Almost there.</i>

713
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:33,365
<i>Whoa!</i>

714
00:35:33,399 --> 00:35:35,634
<i>Hey, who turned</i>
<i>out the lights?</i>

715
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:37,002
<i>[laughs]</i>

716
00:35:37,035 --> 00:35:39,438
<i>Well, I hope nobody saw that.</i>

717
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:40,706
<i>I got to get out of here.</i>

718
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:41,773
[stretching]

<i>Whoa!</i>

721
00:35:47,713 --> 00:35:49,248
<i>Huh? Whoa.</i>

722
00:35:52,017 --> 00:35:53,219
<i>Yikes!</i>

723
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:56,955
<i>Aww, man, I got to</i>
<i>get ahold of myself.</i>

724
00:36:04,463 --> 00:36:07,132
<i>Well, everything</i>
<i>seems to be in order.</i>

725
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,268
<i>I better get some shut-eye.</i>

726
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:14,973
<i>Wait, it's counter-clockwise.</i>

727
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,575
<i>No clockwise.</i>
<i>No counter-clockwise.</i>

728
00:36:16,608 --> 00:36:17,609
<i>[mumbling, sighs]</i>

729
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,358
Hayley:
Hey, dog, come here.

730
00:36:33,492 --> 00:36:35,361
Come on,
I've got something for you.

731
00:36:35,394 --> 00:36:37,396
<i>Ooph, deja vu.</i>

732
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:39,365
Poor little guy.

733
00:36:39,398 --> 00:36:42,033
<i>Okay, I'm here,</i>
<i>but no tricks.</i>

734
00:36:42,067 --> 00:36:44,303
<i>All right, sis,</i>
<i>what's on your mind?</i>

735
00:36:44,336 --> 00:36:46,972
I've been mean to you

736
00:36:47,005 --> 00:36:49,841
and I want you to know
I'm sorry.

737
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:51,643
It's not you.

738
00:36:51,677 --> 00:36:54,680
It's that my parents
died recently

739
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:57,583
and I've really been mean
to everyone lately.

740
00:36:57,616 --> 00:37:01,052
I love my grandma
and she's trying her best,

741
00:37:01,086 --> 00:37:02,721
but she thinks
I'm supposed to be outside

742
00:37:02,754 --> 00:37:04,055
playing with other kids.

743
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:05,190
I don't do that.

744
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,758
<i>Well, why tell me this?</i>

745
00:37:06,792 --> 00:37:09,127
<i>I'm a dog.</i>
<i>Nobody cares what</i>
<i>a dog thinks.</i>

746
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,362
[sighs]

747
00:37:10,396 --> 00:37:12,664
Nobody cares
what a kid thinks.

748
00:37:12,698 --> 00:37:14,600
<i>Is there an echo in here?</i>

749
00:37:14,633 --> 00:37:17,603
Here, I got you something.

750
00:37:17,636 --> 00:37:19,170
<i>Another cat toy?</i>

751
00:37:19,204 --> 00:37:21,573
It's a piece of chicken,
but don't eat the bone.

752
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:24,410
Grandma still
thinks you're a cat.

753
00:37:24,443 --> 00:37:26,678
She's too vain
to wear her glasses.

754
00:37:26,712 --> 00:37:28,747
<i>Oh, girl, you rock.</i>

755
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,649
So are we friends?

756
00:37:30,682 --> 00:37:31,750
Shall we shake?

757
00:37:31,783 --> 00:37:33,218
<i>Oh, we don't play that.</i>

758
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,252
<i>Eesh.</i>

759
00:37:34,286 --> 00:37:34,953
[sighs]

760
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,505
Meiser:
Okay, I can handle this.

761
00:37:53,539 --> 00:37:54,773
-Okay, yeah, just calm down.
-Just back me up.

762
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:56,074
I got your back.
Relax.

763
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,275
It's your job,
here we go.

764
00:37:57,309 --> 00:37:58,276
[Agent clears throat]
No guns.

765
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:59,878
Meiser: Good afternoon,
Mrs. Jeffries...

766
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:01,313
[light chuckle]

767
00:38:01,347 --> 00:38:03,415
Where are your friends,
the news cameras?

768
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:04,883
Did you forget
to call them?

769
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:07,185
We're not in the habit
of involving parties

770
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:08,954
who have no bearing
on the case.

771
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:11,490
On the contrary,
they have great bearing
on the case.

772
00:38:11,523 --> 00:38:14,292
They keep you two
from acting like outlaws.

773
00:38:14,326 --> 00:38:17,763
Outlaws? I can't say
I know what you mean,
Mrs. Jeffries.

774
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:19,531
Thanks for letting
the whole world

775
00:38:19,565 --> 00:38:21,199
know about my finances.

776
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:22,768
What are you two
doing here, anyway?

777
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:24,436
I've got a lot
of work to do.

778
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:27,038
We want to give you
one last chance.

779
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,108
Do you have a court order?

780
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,844
No, we're
trying to be helpful.

781
00:38:32,878 --> 00:38:35,481
You know, my father
built that business
up from nothing

782
00:38:35,514 --> 00:38:36,848
the year that I was born.

783
00:38:36,882 --> 00:38:39,851
He was a good man
who taught us to work hard
and be honest.

784
00:38:39,885 --> 00:38:41,453
That's how he ran things.

785
00:38:41,487 --> 00:38:43,655
We're not here
to argue whether or not
you're right or wrong.

786
00:38:43,689 --> 00:38:45,056
When your father
ran the business,

787
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:48,059
he had one store.
You have over 50.

788
00:38:48,093 --> 00:38:49,528
Over 50.

789
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:51,397
My accountants
have been instructed

790
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:53,665
to honestly report all taxes

791
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:57,969
and I have just
sent an accounting
of my personal cash reserve.

792
00:38:58,003 --> 00:38:59,337
Frankly, Mrs. Jeffries,

793
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:01,373
we don't believe you
or your accountants.

794
00:39:01,407 --> 00:39:04,042
-Oh, really?
-Hmm.

795
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:06,978
Would you excuse me
for a moment?

796
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:15,454
Meiser: Tough cookie.

797
00:39:15,487 --> 00:39:17,122
Mechanic: They don't
pay me enough for this.

798
00:39:17,155 --> 00:39:18,824
Yeah, cookie...

799
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:29,100
<i>They put a man on the moon,</i>

800
00:39:29,134 --> 00:39:30,869
<i>but they can't make</i>
<i>a paw-friendly faucet.</i>

801
00:39:33,338 --> 00:39:35,874
Mrs. Jeffries,
this is your last chance.

802
00:39:35,907 --> 00:39:38,577
If we have to come back,
it'll be with a court order

803
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:39,878
and the police.

804
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:42,914
<i>Get off my land!</i>

805

811
00:40:23,589 --> 00:40:25,457
Hi, Mrs. Jeffries.

812
00:40:25,491 --> 00:40:27,125
Hi, Lucretia,
come on in.

813
00:40:29,628 --> 00:40:31,362
Keeping the same
hair this week?

814
00:40:31,396 --> 00:40:33,164
I'm gonna be
like this forever.

-[Ethel chuckles]
-I'm kind of like

in love with Drac,
my boyfriend.

817
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:38,336
He's cool

818
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:40,606
and not afraid
of anything or anyone.

819
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:42,073
Really?
How do you know?

820
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:43,575
-He told me.
-Oh.

821
00:40:46,244 --> 00:40:48,714
So tonight's a big night
at the new club.

822
00:40:48,747 --> 00:40:50,448
Yeah, we're all
a tad nervous.

823
00:40:50,482 --> 00:40:51,483
By the way,
help yourself

824
00:40:51,517 --> 00:40:53,284
to the macaroni and cheese
on the stove.

825
00:40:53,318 --> 00:40:55,053
-Where's Hayley?
-Upstairs...

826
00:40:55,086 --> 00:40:56,187
Both: Reading.

827
00:40:56,221 --> 00:40:57,288
I'm gonna go and change.

828
00:40:57,322 --> 00:40:58,590
Okay.

00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:05,631
<i>Oh, karate.</i>

<i>-[man grunting]</i>
-Man: <i>Use the attacker's</i>

832
00:41:07,232 --> 00:41:11,169
<i>It's a question of balance,</i>
<i>not wax-on, wax-off.</i>

833
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:13,271
<i>Defensive posturing</i>
<i>and strength</i>

834
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,306
<i>could render</i>

835
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:17,275
<i>and with a minimal</i>
<i>amount of moves,</i>

836

Chihuahua: Hmm.

838
00:41:23,248 --> 00:41:24,215
Can I come in?

839
00:41:24,249 --> 00:41:25,584
Sure, Grandma.

840
00:41:31,623 --> 00:41:32,958
What's the matter, sweetheart?

841
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:35,594
Why did their plane
have to crash?

842
00:41:35,627 --> 00:41:37,428
I miss Mom
and Dad so much.

843
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:39,631
Oh, honey.

844
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:42,367
So do I.

845
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:44,836
It's not fair, Grandma.

846
00:41:47,272 --> 00:41:48,540
[sighs]

847
00:41:48,574 --> 00:41:50,676
I wish I knew
a way to explain it...

848
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:56,748
but life is a series
of good and bad things
that happen to us.

849
00:41:57,749 --> 00:41:59,951
The important thing
is how we react.

850
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,489
We can't let the bad things
destroy us, honey.

851
00:42:05,957 --> 00:42:08,193
Sometimes when things
don't go well,

852
00:42:08,226 --> 00:42:12,197
well, we just have
to accept it and go on.

853
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:15,701
I know what
you're saying, Grandma,

854
00:42:15,734 --> 00:42:17,435
but it still hurts.

855
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:20,972
Can I be alone
for a little while?

856
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,441
Of course.

857
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:37,689
I love you, honey.

858
00:42:37,723 --> 00:42:39,390

Just keeping tabs

You're not supposed
to be back stage.

I don't care
if you want to
watch the show,

but I prefer if
you stay away from here.

1272

It's for artists only.

1273

We're expecting to get
our search warrant tonight,
Mrs. Jeffries.

When we do,
we'll be at your house

-Ooh.
-Bye-bye, bye-bye.

1283
01:09:20,290 --> 01:09:22,292
We're gonna leave her here
and that's the end of it.

1284
01:09:22,326 --> 01:09:24,428
She can identify us.

1285
01:09:24,461 --> 01:09:26,095
Well, what do you
want to do?

1286
01:09:26,129 --> 01:09:27,197
Take her with us?

Well, I'm not sharing
my half of the money with her.

I'm gonna tell you
that right now.
