      He's more or less
      second in command
      to Dr. Quilly.

141
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:42,120
      He's an angel.
      He's an Adonis.

142
00:13:42,122 --> 00:13:44,489
  But he's very professional.

143
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:47,225
  When I think
  about him I get wet.

145
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:01,606
                Dr. Quilly, this
               is Susan Manning.

146
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:04,976
  Of course.
  Welcome, welcome!

147
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:06,945
      I'm so happy
      you found us.

148
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:09,280
              Thank you, Doctor.
    Won't you sit down?

149
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:10,849
  How about a
  nice cup of tea?

150
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:12,183
                  Oh, please.

151
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,619
  Ms. Donnymead,
  would you be kind?

152
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:21,893
  Again, Miss Manning,
  my condolences
  on your loss.

153
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:24,462
            Oh, I appreciate
            that, Doctor.

154
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:28,166
      I think it's
      almost an obscenity

155
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:30,134
      for a psychiatrist
      to commit suicide.

156
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:35,807
              Why any more
              than anyone else?

157
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:37,976
    Because of our
    responsibilities.

158
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:43,381
      Can you imagine the
      effect of a suicide on
      a doctor's patients?

159
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:44,616
                    Yes.

161

          Not now, Henry.
          I'm busy.

    make-up man.

163

    to play anybody
    but himself.

164
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:06,771
          Have you kept
          in touch with your
        family and your friends?

165
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:10,174
          That can be a
          comfort, you know?

166
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:13,745
  No. I really wanted
  to get my life
  organized first.

167
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:16,247
  I have my
  credentials here.

168
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:19,584
            Oh, there's no
            real need for that.

169
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:24,255
          Here at the Institute
          we believe people are
          who they say they are.

170
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:27,058
              Now, Nurse, if you
              are to be with us

171
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,895
          I must ask that
          you put aside any
        preconditioned attitudes

172
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:33,431
          you may have
          as to the treatment
          of the insane.

173
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:39,304
  Oh, Dr. Quilly, a man
  with your reputation doesn't
  have to explain originality.

174
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:43,775
        Well, our theories
        are deceptively simple.

175
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,743
            Our guests...

176
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:48,079
       Well, they have fantasies
        that are not accepted

177
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:52,383
      in the so-called
      outside, real, sane world.

178
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:57,322
        But here, under extreme
        controlled situations,

179
00:15:57,324 --> 00:15:59,991
          we allow them to
         act out their fantasies

180
00:15:59,993 --> 00:16:01,659
                as if they were
                totally sane.

181
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:04,796
      Yes. I met some of
      your guests earlier.

182
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:08,132
        And we have found
        that if they get to
       exercise these fantasies,

183
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:11,836
          after a time they
          no longer need them.

184
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:13,304
            Now, I realize
            that takes a while,

185
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,307
          but there are no
          sudden therapies
          for the mad,

186
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:19,410
              so here
              at the Institute
              no one is mad.

187
00:16:21,915 --> 00:16:24,849
                Uh, would you
                be willing to
               dress as a nurse?

188
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:26,884
  That's your prerogative.

189
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:32,156
  I really want
  this opportunity.

190
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,292
                Then I take it,
                Miss Manning,

191
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:38,162
      that you are prepared
      to commit to the Institute
      and all its values?

192
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:41,632
      Not only to the Institute,
      but to all its people.

193
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:43,034
                  Ah!

194
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:46,637
          Now I really believe
          you understand us.

195
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,173
          However, I will
          need a commitment.

196
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:51,676
              Your commitment.

197
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,678
            You have it.

198
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:56,681
                  Done and done.

199
00:16:56,683 --> 00:17:00,385
      There is, I'm afraid,
      some boring paper work.

200
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:06,624
    Your withholding thing,
    your RN registration number
    and more ad nauseam.

201
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:09,961
    Such a gigantic bureaucracy
    for such a small formality.

202
00:17:09,963 --> 00:17:11,462
  It's just as bad at home.

203
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:14,499
      Ms. Donnymead will fill in
      all the details

204
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:18,269
   from that letter you sent us.
   Why don't you just sign here?

        swamped with paper work.

206
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:31,382
      I can't tell you
      how excited I am.

207
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:34,685
  Uh, do you have
  a phone that I could use?
  Collect, of course.

208
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:38,256
  I want to call my family
  and tell them I'm all right,

      productive again.

210
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:46,030
          I'm sorry,
          I'm afraid we
          cannot have that.

211
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:47,732
  I promise it's collect.

212
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:52,870

      you are not ready yet

213

        to upset your
        family and friends,
        not at all ready.

214
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:00,945
    Don't forget you have
    just committed yourself.

215
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:04,248
  I beg your pardon?
  Did you say committed?

216
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:07,452
  No, I'm here as a nurse.

217
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:11,355
          Of course you are.
          You are whatever
          you say you are.

218
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:14,092
        Don't you remember?
        I told you about
        our theories

219
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:16,694
          and you said you
          would commit to us.

220
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:21,365
    I meant committed
    in an entirely
    different context.

00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:23,367
          I'm a nurse.

          Oh, Nurse Manning,
          why would I do

277
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:05,970
        such a cruel
        and ludicrous thing?

278
00:25:05,972 --> 00:25:09,306
            Now, look at me.
            Am I a cruel man?

        Dr. Quilly.

280
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:16,380
  Would you
  please reconsider this
  whole, terrible mistake?

281
00:25:17,817 --> 00:25:20,117
            Once committed,

282
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:22,553
        I cannot release you
        until I believe

283
00:25:22,555 --> 00:25:25,656
          that you are a normal,
          healthy human being.

284
00:25:25,658 --> 00:25:27,157
          Why did you
          commit yourself?

285
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:28,659
        I didn't!

  he said that Ms. Donny...

288
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:35,699

      of signing blank forms?

290
00:25:38,671 --> 00:25:41,071
    Of course I'm not
    in the habit of
    signing blank forms.

291
00:25:41,073 --> 00:25:44,642
  It just seemed so routine.
  We spoke on the phone.

292

    for the job and...

          to help you.

296
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:58,722

  a basement room.

297
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:01,258

          Can you take us there?

298
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,360
  No, I can't take you there.
  I don't know how I got there

299
00:26:03,362 --> 00:26:05,329
  and I don't know
  who put me there.

300

301
00:26:07,867 --> 00:26:09,867

            no basement room

00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:22,780
          Yes. It is somewhere.

00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,273

321

350

      The destruction of clothes
      is a desire to be naked.

351

          And what is naked?

352
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:55,005
              Naked is to be
              a fetus again.

   objected to wearing a uniform
    and you said you didn't.

00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:40,297
            Therapy. And you
            committed yourself.

412
00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:44,734
    You still don't believe
    I'm sane, do you?

413
00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:46,636
          I believe that
          I can help.

414
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:50,574
        Dr. Moore,
        I am not insane.

415
00:36:50,576 --> 00:36:52,576
        I came here to work.

416
00:36:54,246 --> 00:36:56,913
      I'll make time for
      you tomorrow afternoon
      at 3:00.

417
00:36:56,915 --> 00:36:59,316
          We can talk then.

418
00:36:59,318 --> 00:37:02,819
          Rest. Now, you'll
          be all right.

419
00:37:02,821 --> 00:37:05,589
                  It'll be fine.
                  Believe me.

420
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:55,171
                      (GASPS)
                      Hi!

421
00:37:56,408 --> 00:37:58,475
  Do you want
  some company?

422
00:38:00,712 --> 00:38:02,812
  Do you remember me?

423
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:06,316
                          Yes.

424
00:38:06,318 --> 00:38:08,785
  You feel like
  you don't belong here.

425
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,153
                      I don't.

426
00:38:11,757 --> 00:38:15,725
  That's the way
  everybody thought
  when they first came.

427
00:38:15,727 --> 00:38:19,262
  But then you...
  You'll accept.

428
00:38:19,264 --> 00:38:20,797
  You'll see.

429
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,734
  Would you like to cry?

430
00:38:24,736 --> 00:38:26,569
          Then cry.

431
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:32,075
  I believe that crying in
  the presence of someone

432
00:38:32,077 --> 00:38:34,678
  is more comforting
  than to cry alone.

433
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,180
  I cried for days
  when I first came here.

434
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,750
      And I cried alone.

435
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,420
      You're not alone.

436
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:48,058
      That's really nice of you.

437
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:51,861
          What's your name?

438
00:38:51,863 --> 00:38:53,029
              Ronnie.

439
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:54,698
                Ronnie.

440
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,533
          We're gonna be
          great friends,
          aren't we?

441
00:38:56,535 --> 00:38:57,667
                Mmm-hmm.

442
00:38:57,669 --> 00:39:00,770
    I've got my planes. Oh!

443
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:04,341
  And I've got these.

444
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,647
  (CHUCKLES)

445
00:39:10,649 --> 00:39:12,349
                  Where did
                  you get those?

446
00:39:12,351 --> 00:39:15,018
          Nurse Parker
          gave them to me.

447
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:19,222
          Nurse Parker?
        That's who Ms. Donnymead
          keeps calling me.

448
00:39:19,224 --> 00:39:20,957
       Do you know where she is?

449
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:25,862
  She's gone.
  She's never coming back.

450
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:28,298
        But we're gonna
        be great friends,
        aren't we?

451
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:32,936
        Ronnie, tell me
        more about the keys.

452
00:39:35,006 --> 00:39:38,742
  They open everything.
  This one here,

453
00:39:38,744 --> 00:39:40,210
  key to my heart.

454
00:39:40,212 --> 00:39:41,978
  (LAUGHING)

455
00:40:19,251 --> 00:40:21,017
              ISANDRA: I've just
              finished a poem.

456
00:40:22,254 --> 00:40:25,021
                  My reading's
                  this evening,
                  you must come.

457
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:27,524
                The acclaim will
               be unprecedented.

458
00:40:29,127 --> 00:40:30,293
  Were you always a poet?

459
00:40:30,295 --> 00:40:33,163
      Always.
      Great poets are born.

460
00:40:34,633 --> 00:40:37,434
        I didn't know that
        until I arrived here.

461
00:40:37,436 --> 00:40:40,036
  Did Dr. Quilly
  explain that to you?

462
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:43,640
    Dr. Quilly is dead.

463
00:40:43,642 --> 00:40:45,308
            Dr. Quilly is dead?

464
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:51,581
  Oh, yes. The man
  we now call Dr. Quilly
  explained it to me.

465
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:57,320
    Now, if Dr. Quilly is dead,
    who is the man that
    calls himself Dr. Quilly?

466
00:40:57,322 --> 00:40:58,788
          Just a guest.

467
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,156
              A guest?

468
00:41:00,158 --> 00:41:01,591
                One of us.

469
00:41:01,593 --> 00:41:05,962
       Oh, when Dr. Quilly died,
        there was great unrest.

470
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:09,332
              We all felt
              so unprotected.

471
00:41:09,334 --> 00:41:12,235
  So a guest became Dr. Quilly.

472
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:17,407
    Isandra, you sure you're
    not making this up?

473
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:21,244
      When did Dr. Quilly die?

474
00:41:21,246 --> 00:41:22,645
              Yesterday.

475
00:41:24,416 --> 00:41:27,350
      And when did you
      arrive at the Institute?

476
00:41:27,352 --> 00:41:30,086
    Today or maybe tomorrow.

477
00:41:31,356 --> 00:41:33,990
          Time is of no
          importance to a poet.

478
00:41:37,462 --> 00:41:38,895
            I see.

479
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:41,764
          Um, I have to go.

480
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:43,266
        You won't forget
        my reading?

481
00:41:43,268 --> 00:41:44,667
              No.

482
00:41:53,945 --> 00:41:55,612
               Oh, Dr. Preisser.

483
00:41:55,614 --> 00:41:57,780
          Yes?

484
00:41:57,782 --> 00:42:01,618
            Oh, I'd like to
           apologize if I seemed

485
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:03,987
            rude to you
           last night at dinner.

486
00:42:03,989 --> 00:42:06,389
  I appreciate that, Nurse.

487
00:42:06,391 --> 00:42:10,760
  You see, in the Institute
  we all must be very, very
  kind to each other.

488
00:42:11,496 --> 00:42:12,629
                    Doctor?

489
00:42:12,631 --> 00:42:15,198
  Yes? Do you want
  to talk to me?

490
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,299
                    Yes.

491
00:42:16,301 --> 00:42:18,301
  Then, please, sit down.

492
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:27,677
    I just really wanted to know
   if you knew Dr. Quilly before
    you came to the Institute?

493
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:29,412
          No. Why?

494
00:42:31,182 --> 00:42:34,417
        Well, frankly,
        there's been some talk.

495
00:42:34,419 --> 00:42:36,519
      I don't take it seriously.

496
00:42:36,521 --> 00:42:39,389
        About Dr. Quilly,
        the real Dr. Quilly.

497
00:42:40,158 --> 00:42:41,624
              He is...

498
00:42:42,994 --> 00:42:44,093
        Well, he's, uh...

499
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,895
                  Dead?

500
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:47,163
    So you heard that?

501
00:42:47,165 --> 00:42:49,999
        Oh. everyone has.

502
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:53,903
          You know,
          Isandra's fantasies
          are quite public here.

503
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:57,173
            She's been saying
            them for years.

504
00:42:57,175 --> 00:42:58,841
          How long has
          she been here?

505
00:42:58,843 --> 00:43:02,445
  She came here
  when she was a
  very, very young girl.

506
00:43:02,447 --> 00:43:04,080
  Long before I did.

507
00:43:06,785 --> 00:43:08,251
                Oh.

508
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:21,998
    Nurse Manning.

509
00:43:24,369 --> 00:43:26,302
        Won't you sit down?

510
00:43:26,304 --> 00:43:28,771
            Dr. Moore, you
            know how I feel
            about being here.

511
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:30,406
  You've been
  most articulate.

512
00:43:30,408 --> 00:43:32,375
                   Well, it goes
                    beyond that.

513
00:43:32,377 --> 00:43:35,111
            I've heard the
            most amazing things.

514
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:38,615
          For instance, the real
          Dr. Quilly is dead

515
00:43:38,617 --> 00:43:41,718
              and Nurse Parker,
              she may have
              been murdered.

516
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,721
        And the other nurses,
       they've just disappeared.

517
00:43:44,723 --> 00:43:49,092
            Dr. Moore,
            it seems to me
            that the Institute

518
00:43:49,094 --> 00:43:51,461
            is far sicker
            than the patients.

519
00:43:51,463 --> 00:43:56,332
  Innuendo. All you're really
  referring to is innuendo.

520
00:43:56,334 --> 00:43:58,234
              Are you saying
              I've invented
              all of this?

521
00:44:00,071 --> 00:44:01,504
        Let's find out.

522
00:44:01,506 --> 00:44:04,507
    Let's try to put things
    in their proper perspective.

523
00:44:04,509 --> 00:44:06,976
          Are you willing
          to help me try
          to understand?

524
00:44:08,279 --> 00:44:09,612
            Yes, I am.

525
00:44:09,614 --> 00:44:12,582
      All right, fine.
      Won't you sit down?

526
00:44:16,755 --> 00:44:18,121
              All right.

527
00:44:18,123 --> 00:44:20,390
              Now, let's try to
            put things in order.

528
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,260
            You're from Seattle?

529
00:44:24,262 --> 00:44:25,862
              Yes.

530
00:44:25,864 --> 00:44:27,930
                  And you came
                here as a nurse?

531
00:44:27,932 --> 00:44:29,465
        Of course.

532
00:44:29,467 --> 00:44:32,101
          And your Dr. Swanson,

533
00:44:32,103 --> 00:44:35,705
            you say he was
            a psychotherapist.

534
00:44:35,707 --> 00:44:38,274
          Yes, he was.

535
00:44:38,276 --> 00:44:40,576
          And you believe
          he killed himself?

536
00:44:42,347 --> 00:44:44,947
      I thought you said
      you were gonna help me.

537
00:44:44,949 --> 00:44:46,949
          I thought you
          were different.

538
00:44:46,951 --> 00:44:49,786
          I thought...
          That I was your
        knight in shining armor?

539
00:44:49,788 --> 00:44:51,721
                No.

540
00:44:51,723 --> 00:44:53,623
          I thought at least
          you were a doctor
          with some integrity.

541
00:44:57,395 --> 00:45:00,329
          SUSAN: Ronnie,
          you've got to help me.

542
00:45:00,331 --> 00:45:03,132
      Of course
      I'll help you.
      Now, watch.

543
00:45:03,134 --> 00:45:08,037
        You must know
       how I can reach my family
       or anyone on the outside.

544
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:10,707
  Shh! Isandra's gonna
  read her poetry now.

545
00:45:13,978 --> 00:45:17,380
              Ronnie, I don't
              want to cry alone.

546
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:24,721
  Look, I'll tell you what.

547
00:45:24,723 --> 00:45:29,826
  Why don't you meet me
  tonight in Quilly's office
  at 3:00 a.m.?

548
00:45:29,828 --> 00:45:33,196
  Everybody's asleep then.
  We can use Quilly's phone.

549
00:45:33,198 --> 00:45:34,931
      You know how to
      get into Quilly's office?

550
00:45:34,933 --> 00:45:38,101
      Of course.
      Remember these?

551
00:45:38,103 --> 00:45:40,002
        (GIGGLES)

552
00:45:40,004 --> 00:45:44,674
  Just be in Quilly's office
  tonight at 3:00
  and don't be late.

553
00:45:44,676 --> 00:45:48,344
  I get sort of
  frightened when I'm
  in there all alone.

554
00:45:48,346 --> 00:45:50,012
                Gentlemen.

555
00:45:54,018 --> 00:45:56,786
  I have a special treat
  for you this evening.

556
00:45:56,788 --> 00:46:02,792
  The first public reading
  of the Institute's own
  poetess in residence,

557
00:46:02,794 --> 00:46:05,428
  the lovely Isandra Snow.

558
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:07,263
  DONNYMEAD: Bravo! Bravo!

559
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:14,804
        I shall make no speech.

560
00:46:14,806 --> 00:46:18,207
          Oh, goody.
          How about no poetry?

561
00:46:18,209 --> 00:46:20,810
      Gow, you can shut up
      or you can leave!

562
00:46:20,812 --> 00:46:22,512
            And miss all this?

563
00:46:25,316 --> 00:46:28,317
  My name is not Isandra.

564
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:29,986
      It's Cassandra.

565
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:37,960
            Or suiting yourself
            something else.

566
00:46:37,962 --> 00:46:40,429
          Please, anything else.

567
00:46:40,431 --> 00:46:41,998
  She's beautiful.

569
00:46:43,668 --> 00:46:46,068
            This is a terrible
            experience for her.

570
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:47,904
            Don't they know what
           they're doing to her?

    rise slowly...

00:47:13,031 --> 00:47:14,831
        You all stop this now!

577
00:47:14,833 --> 00:47:17,967
  You're a guest!
  If anything has to be stopped
  around here, I'll do it!

578
00:47:17,969 --> 00:47:20,636
            You insist that
            I'm the nurse?

579
00:47:20,638 --> 00:47:23,339
            The only nurse?
            Well, so be it.

580
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:27,176
         If your beloved doctors
        won't stop this, I will.

581
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:31,180
        Forget her, Sandy, baby.
          Go on, you're great!

582
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:32,715
          Mr. Gow, get out!

583
00:47:32,717 --> 00:47:35,184
          And are you
          going to carry me out?

584
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:36,519
          No, but I will.

585
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:38,955
          You can all leave now.

586
00:47:38,957 --> 00:47:43,726
      Now you've proven how
      strong and brave you are.

587
00:47:43,728 --> 00:47:46,462
              We'll all listen
              to the nurse. Out!

  people to their rooms.

  Oh, yes, but if
  you'll excuse me,

  pills and some rest.

  Dr. Quilly, please?

            it was just fine.

        to concentrate.

00:51:06,664 --> 00:51:09,065

         uh, he keeps the phone,
          uh, in that drawer.

     <i> You know you're a patient.</i>
      <i> Now, why don't you</i>
      <i> just go to sleep?</i>

648
00:52:24,842 --> 00:52:26,175
          She hung up.

649
00:52:26,177 --> 00:52:27,576
      Let's go see the Spitfire.

650
00:52:27,578 --> 00:52:29,745
      No. Give me your keys.

651
00:52:29,747 --> 00:52:34,617
            No. Uh-uh.
            Nurse Parker gave
            these to me. Uh-uh.

652
00:52:34,619 --> 00:52:36,685
            Ronnie, this is
            very important.

653
00:52:36,687 --> 00:52:39,088

    one of those drawers.

654
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:43,626

  and show them to Desmond,
  he'll believe me.

657
00:52:46,197 --> 00:52:49,365
            Oh! Then we'll go
            see the Spitfire.

658
00:52:49,367 --> 00:52:50,666
            Later.

659
00:52:51,269 --> 00:52:52,768
        Give them to me.

660
00:52:54,138 --> 00:52:58,107
            Well, you're
            my friend. Okay.

661
00:52:58,109 --> 00:53:00,776
  Oh, the file's over there.

662
00:53:00,778 --> 00:53:02,044
                How do you know?

663
00:53:02,046 --> 00:53:03,546
      Well, because when
      I go to his session,

664
00:53:03,548 --> 00:53:06,382
    Dr. Quilly always gets
    my file out of there.

665
00:53:06,384 --> 00:53:07,716
                      Come on.

666
00:53:20,398 --> 00:53:22,631
      These are patient's files.

667
00:53:22,633 --> 00:53:25,201
            Wait, maybe
            I'm in here.
            The real me.

668
00:53:25,203 --> 00:53:27,069
  Well, you are
  the real you.

669
00:53:27,071 --> 00:53:32,241
          I know that,
          but I have to
          prove it somehow.

670
00:53:32,243 --> 00:53:35,978
  These are all in code.
  Of course, they'd be in code.

671
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:39,315
            I don't know,
            we might find some
            pattern to this,

672
00:53:39,317 --> 00:53:41,150
        but this way it doesn't
        make any sense.

          "M-O-T-H-P-R-O-F."

674
00:53:51,262 --> 00:53:54,597
          Wait a minute,
          this is beginning
          to make sense.

675
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:56,832
          This could be
          Darlene Court's card.

00:53:56,834 --> 00:54:01,870
          "C-Y-C." Cyclist.
          That means cyclist.

            "L-I-K-T-Y-S."

681
00:54:20,124 --> 00:54:22,024
  I don't know
  what that is.

00:54:22,026 --> 00:54:23,959

683
00:54:23,961 --> 00:54:25,127

            this is my card,
            do you?

688
00:54:39,477 --> 00:54:41,210
              No.

689
00:54:42,313 --> 00:54:44,546
  Ill. Could be ill.

690

                    It's kill!

          It's too late for
          dear old Ronnie.

692
00:54:57,161 --> 00:55:01,797
          He's so scared of me
          he starts to shit
          every time he sees me.

693
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:04,633
          So, you've been having
        yourself a fine old time

694
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:07,303
              going through
              Dr. Quilly's desk.

695
00:55:07,305 --> 00:55:11,774
          Had yourself a nice
          chat with the operator
          at Crownpoint, huh?

            as I am, young lady.
            We're both very bad.

  and I'll scream!

  Last night
  before I found Isandra,

720
00:59:38,709 --> 00:59:41,443
  I went to David's room
  and his door was unlocked,

721
00:59:41,445 --> 00:59:43,211
  and he wasn't there.

722
00:59:43,213 --> 00:59:47,282
      I saw David earlier
      this morning. He was in
      his room, peaceful, quiet.

723
00:59:47,284 --> 00:59:49,318
      He wasn't in his

724

    Can we discuss this later?

725
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:59,561
      Jones, would you, uh,
    ask one of the staff members

726
00:59:59,563 --> 01:00:02,798
    to bring out some candles
    and the fancy table cloths?

        We're gonna
        have a little service.
        She deserves a service.

728
01:00:06,971 --> 01:00:08,704
            JONES:
           I'll take care of it.

729
01:00:21,085 --> 01:00:23,385
       Hi. You've gotta help me.

730
01:00:23,387 --> 01:00:26,054
    See, I came here as a nurse,
     I had credentials, but they
      took my credentials

731
01:00:26,056 --> 01:00:28,724
                  and they say
                  I'm a patient,
                  but I'm not.

732
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:33,328
          Please, you've
          gotta help me.

733
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:35,931
      Uh, yeah, we understand.
      Listen, ma'am, why don't
      you talk to Dr. Quilly?

734
01:00:35,933 --> 01:00:39,568
  He'll, uh... He'll give you
  all the help you need.
  Excuse me.

735
01:00:39,570 --> 01:00:40,702
                      But...

736
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:59,521
        I've been watching you
        get out of hand, Nurse,

737
01:00:59,523 --> 01:01:00,956
          and I've been
          patient long enough.

738
01:01:00,958 --> 01:01:04,026
       There will be punishment,
        severe punishment!

739
01:01:07,297 --> 01:01:09,031
        I'll handle this, Jones.

740
01:01:09,033 --> 01:01:10,766
        But, Dr. Moore,
        the nurse has been
        breaking all our rules!

741
01:01:10,768 --> 01:01:13,001
        How the hell am I
        supposed to keep
        order around here?

742
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:15,037
              You're doing a
            splendid job, Jones.

743
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:17,272
            Why don't you
            help the others in?
            Go ahead.

744
01:01:21,779 --> 01:01:23,812
      JONES: All right,
      let's go. Back inside.

745
01:01:23,814 --> 01:01:26,381
      Okay, everyone
      back inside. Let's go.

746
01:01:38,696 --> 01:01:41,196
  SUSAN:
  Isandra told me
  a way to escape.

747
01:01:42,399 --> 01:01:44,399
  Now, I know what
  she really meant.

748
01:01:44,401 --> 01:01:47,302
  There's only one way
  to leave the Institute.

749
01:02:29,012 --> 01:02:31,947
                  Henry seems to
                  do him better
                than the others.

750
01:02:35,886 --> 01:02:39,688
      You know, I have to admit,
      my ego is slightly dented.

751
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:42,090
            Henry has literally
            never done me.

752
01:02:42,092 --> 01:02:45,393
  Maybe that's because you're
  not the real Dr. Quilly.

753
01:02:45,395 --> 01:02:47,863
                  Now, now,
                  you mustn't
                  mumble, Nurse.

754
01:02:47,865 --> 01:02:50,465
                We can't hear
                what you say,
                we can't help.

755
01:02:52,603 --> 01:02:55,437
    You didn't help Isandra,
    and you heard her.

756
01:02:55,439 --> 01:02:59,040
        You made her speak
        loud and clear and
        everybody listened.

757
01:02:59,042 --> 01:03:00,776
      You knew they would laugh.

758
01:03:02,412 --> 01:03:04,913
  The theory worked.

759
01:03:04,915 --> 01:03:07,916
  Isandra did
  become the poet

760
01:03:07,918 --> 01:03:10,786
  and the poet
  was released
  from the Institute.

761
01:03:12,723 --> 01:03:17,459
            Are you suggesting
            my responsibility
            for Isandra's death?

762
01:03:19,563 --> 01:03:21,663
            Is that what you're
            saying, Dr. Moore?

763
01:03:22,733 --> 01:03:24,666
            I demand an answer.

764
01:03:24,668 --> 01:03:27,736
  Not here, Doctor.
  We have patients here.

765
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:35,577
      Jones, Ms. Donnymead,
    Lucille, see our guests out.

766
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:39,514
            This meal is over!

767
01:03:42,019 --> 01:03:45,187
                You too, Nurse,
                may be excused.

768
01:03:48,959 --> 01:03:50,759
          (BELL RINGING)

769
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:10,045
  How dare you
  question me in public?

770
01:04:10,047 --> 01:04:12,147
              I asked you
            not to make a scene.

771
01:04:12,149 --> 01:04:14,449
  Everything is a scene
  here at the Institute.

772
01:04:15,352 --> 01:04:17,552
  It was designed that way.

773
01:04:19,056 --> 01:04:25,627
  Desmond, suicide was
  Isandra's final fantasy.

774
01:04:26,330 --> 01:04:28,396
  Her final freedom.

775
01:04:28,398 --> 01:04:30,966
  Now, it's regretful,
  but it does happen.

776
01:04:30,968 --> 01:04:34,369
  You didn't suppose that
  the Institute was the only
  mental hospital in the world

777
01:04:34,371 --> 01:04:37,372
  that didn't have its
  percentage of failures?

778
01:04:38,075 --> 01:04:40,075
    Adler failed.

779
01:04:40,077 --> 01:04:41,443
        Jung failed.

780
01:04:42,512 --> 01:04:44,079
      Freud failed!

781
01:04:44,081 --> 01:04:48,483
        But they didn't
        accept failure as
        the ultimate therapy.

782
01:04:48,485 --> 01:04:52,520
                Dr. Quilly,
               you know how long
               I've admired you.

783
01:04:52,522 --> 01:04:54,990
                 We studied your
                books in school,

784
01:04:54,992 --> 01:04:58,026
       we practically worshipped
        at your shrine.

785
01:04:58,028 --> 01:05:01,329
            I came here to learn
              from a great man.

786
01:05:01,331 --> 01:05:04,165
        I'm still trying to
        discover your theories.

787
01:05:04,167 --> 01:05:06,201
          Your real theories.

788
01:05:06,203 --> 01:05:08,536
     Those great books of yours.

789
01:05:08,538 --> 01:05:12,607
  Theoretical books
  put into practice

790
01:05:12,609 --> 01:05:14,709
  are not necessarily
  neat, Desmond.

791
01:05:14,711 --> 01:05:18,179
  A book belongs on a shelf,
  you bring it to life,
  it's no longer a book.

792
01:05:18,181 --> 01:05:19,948
          What is it, Doctor?

793
01:05:23,086 --> 01:05:24,753

01:05:34,064 --> 01:05:35,430
          Yeah.

798
01:05:36,566 --> 01:05:38,800
  SUSAN: Was it
  bad with Quilly?

799
01:05:38,802 --> 01:05:39,968
                    Yes.

800
01:05:41,071 --> 01:05:42,971
  Must be hard for you.

801
01:05:44,641 --> 01:05:48,944
        Well, for me to have
        had the temerity even
        to question that man...

802
01:05:48,946 --> 01:05:51,046
          Maybe he's
          not that man.

803
01:05:52,249 --> 01:05:55,717
          Please, Susan, that's
          Isandra's story again.

804
01:05:55,719 --> 01:05:59,387
    No, no, I'm not talking
    about Isandra's story.

805
01:05:59,389 --> 01:06:01,323
        I'm just saying
        that people
        sometimes change

806
01:06:01,325 --> 01:06:05,460
    and the Quilly
    that you respected so much
    may be a different one now.

807
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:08,897
      Some people have
      paid a terrible price
      for greatness.

808
01:06:10,567 --> 01:06:12,634
          Like your Dr. Swanson?

809
01:06:15,072 --> 01:06:16,972
          He could have
          been a great man.

810
01:06:19,776 --> 01:06:24,512
    Susan, there are times
    when I am absolutely
    convinced you are sane.

811
01:06:26,616 --> 01:06:28,283
              Then,

812
01:06:28,285 --> 01:06:31,619
    as yesterday morning,
    that fantasy about
    David's disappearance...

813
01:06:31,621 --> 01:06:33,521
        David was not there!

814
01:06:34,958 --> 01:06:38,226
          All right, Susan,
          anything you say.

815
01:06:39,296 --> 01:06:41,196
  Don't patronize me.

816
01:06:45,168 --> 01:06:46,768
            I was, wasn't I?

817
01:06:46,770 --> 01:06:48,003
        Yes.

818
01:07:26,410 --> 01:07:29,544
          Please don't scream!
          I don't like screams!

819
01:07:32,416 --> 01:07:34,549
              Besides,
              it wouldn't help!

820
01:07:37,154 --> 01:07:41,689
  David, I just saw
  you in your room and
  the door was locked.

821
01:07:41,691 --> 01:07:44,059
              No, it wasn't.

822
01:07:44,061 --> 01:07:47,095
            I was out,
            but after I got
            back to my room

823
01:07:47,097 --> 01:07:49,264
          no one ever came
         to lock the door again.

824
01:07:50,667 --> 01:07:53,334
        No one knows
        that your door
        is unlocked?

825
01:07:53,336 --> 01:07:54,836
            Only the one
            who let me out.

826
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:59,240
    That is such
    a hard mattress.

827
01:08:01,445 --> 01:08:04,112
    You really should complain.

828
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:20,528
  David, who let you out?

829
01:08:20,530 --> 01:08:22,864
                 Oh, it's always
                the same person.

830
01:08:25,035 --> 01:08:28,303
          I only like it outside
          for a little while.

831
01:08:28,305 --> 01:08:31,606
        I'm really quite
        comfortable in my room.

832
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:34,476
       Except when they wash me.

833
01:08:34,478 --> 01:08:37,312
          I used to wash myself.

834
01:08:37,314 --> 01:08:39,481
  You will again.

835
01:08:41,151 --> 01:08:43,251
                    You promise?

836
01:08:43,253 --> 01:08:44,686
            I promise.

837
01:08:49,493 --> 01:08:52,060
              A person should
              wash his own body.

838
01:08:54,598 --> 01:08:56,397
        I think I will.

839
01:09:07,644 --> 01:09:11,513
          I was told to find you
          and kill you!

840
01:09:11,515 --> 01:09:13,982
        But I couldn't kill you.

841
01:09:15,819 --> 01:09:19,521
               Oh, what a lovely
                person you are.

842
01:09:21,992 --> 01:09:25,527
              You remind me
              of someone who was
              very kind to me.

843
01:09:25,529 --> 01:09:27,228
      Nurse Parker.

844
01:09:28,532 --> 01:09:32,400
        She let me wash myself,
        before they killed her.

845
01:09:35,872 --> 01:09:40,542
            They like to
            kill nurses here.
            And doctors, too.

846
01:09:40,544 --> 01:09:44,312
              And they bury them

847
01:09:44,314 --> 01:09:48,883
            in the cellar.

848
01:09:48,885 --> 01:09:53,188
  David, please tell me
  who let you out
  of your room.

849
01:10:03,733 --> 01:10:05,733
          May I have your brush?

850
01:10:09,739 --> 01:10:11,873
                  I'm tired now.

851
01:10:11,875 --> 01:10:13,908
  Do you wanna
  go to your room?

852
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:15,977
              If you'll take me.

853
01:10:19,015 --> 01:10:20,982
        That was a lovely visit.

854
01:10:28,925 --> 01:10:31,693
  David, where is
  this cellar?

855
01:10:31,695 --> 01:10:34,262
                  Try the old...
          Shh!

856
01:10:34,264 --> 01:10:38,399
              Try the old door
            next to the kitchen.
            Are you going there?

857
01:10:38,401 --> 01:10:41,236
        Maybe.

858
01:10:41,238 --> 01:10:45,173
        I'd invite you in,
        but it's not very tidy.

859
01:10:45,175 --> 01:10:46,841
  That's all right.

860
01:12:02,919 --> 01:12:04,585
          (TOY SQUEAKS)

861
01:12:59,242 --> 01:13:01,109
          It's all in my mind.

862
01:13:51,861 --> 01:13:53,294
                  Hello, Nurse.

863
01:13:53,296 --> 01:13:55,096
          (SIGHS) Luther.

864
01:13:55,098 --> 01:13:57,732
        You're not supposed
       to know about this place,
        neither am I.

865
01:13:57,734 --> 01:13:59,634
      How did you find it?

866
01:13:59,636 --> 01:14:03,204
        Gow showed it to me.
       He knew it would hurt me.

867
01:14:05,308 --> 01:14:08,643
          Come. I have something
          to show you.

868
01:14:14,117 --> 01:14:17,118
        This is Nurse
        Parker's grave.

869
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:21,389
          I worshipped her.
          She was so kind.

870
01:14:22,659 --> 01:14:25,126
        She looked like you,
        you know.

871
01:14:26,129 --> 01:14:27,895
  How do you know
  that's her grave?

872
01:14:27,897 --> 01:14:31,132
        It's the newest.
        She was the last
        to be killed.

873
01:14:31,134 --> 01:14:32,733
            The last one?

874
01:14:32,735 --> 01:14:35,470
              Dr. Quilly was
              the first to die.

875
01:14:35,472 --> 01:14:38,973
                  He's here.
                  The others
                  are outside.

876
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:40,641
                  That's the
                real Dr. Quilly?

877
01:14:40,643 --> 01:14:44,846
          Oh, yes.
          The present Quilly
          is a patient.

878
01:14:44,848 --> 01:14:48,916
      He took over
      when Quilly died
      to carry on his work.

879
01:14:48,918 --> 01:14:50,651
       That's what Isandra said.

880
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:52,687
    Dr. Preisser said
    it was just her fantasy.

881
01:14:52,689 --> 01:14:56,457
  Oh, Preisser's a patient, too.
  We're all patients here,

882
01:14:56,459 --> 01:14:58,292
            except the dead.

883
01:14:58,294 --> 01:15:01,229
      Only the dead are
      sane in the Institute,

884
01:15:03,032 --> 01:15:05,700
          Dr. Moore doesn't know
          anything about this,

885
01:15:05,702 --> 01:15:07,268
                  does he?

886
01:15:08,705 --> 01:15:09,770
                  Does he?

887
01:15:09,772 --> 01:15:10,838
                   LUTHER: Look!

888
01:15:15,812 --> 01:15:19,680
  "Registered Nurse."
  They were nurses, too?

889
01:15:19,682 --> 01:15:21,682
        They bring nurses
        here to the Institute

890
01:15:21,684 --> 01:15:24,719
        so that one of the
        guests can kill them.

891
01:15:24,721 --> 01:15:27,688
        But you don't know
       who's killing the nurses.

892
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:31,659
      No, I don't know.
      I know they get them here,

893
01:15:31,661 --> 01:15:34,896
      they bring them here
      and they never leave.

894
01:15:34,898 --> 01:15:37,665
          You'll sleep here
          one day, Nurse.

895
01:15:37,667 --> 01:15:40,635
    The candles told me so.

896
01:15:40,637 --> 01:15:43,704
          Oh, Lord God!

897
01:15:43,706 --> 01:15:46,207
        Lord God, vengeance.

898
01:15:46,209 --> 01:15:48,476
            Show thyself!

899
01:16:04,928 --> 01:16:06,494
                    (GASPS)

900
01:16:06,496 --> 01:16:10,598
    Dr. Quilly wants
    to see you now.

901
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:12,833
               Suppose I say no?

902
01:16:14,337 --> 01:16:18,606
  Then you say no,
  but you will see
  Dr. Quilly now!

903
01:16:18,608 --> 01:16:21,776
            Good! Because I want
              to see him now!

904
01:16:43,533 --> 01:16:45,466
    Soft evening,
    eh, Nurse?

905
01:16:45,468 --> 01:16:49,136
          Almost as if
          all elements conspired

906
01:16:49,138 --> 01:16:51,806
                to quiet the
                beasts in man.

907
01:16:53,977 --> 01:16:55,943
            (SIGHS)

908
01:16:55,945 --> 01:17:00,948
    You are our most
    difficult guest, Nurse.

909
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:04,285
            Maybe that's because
              I'm not a guest.

910
01:17:04,287 --> 01:17:10,157
    Intense shock therapy
    is the last resort
    of the Institute.

911
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:13,995
        You have brought me
        to that last resort.

912
01:17:13,997 --> 01:17:16,964
  You were here in my office,
  you used the telephone.

913
01:17:16,966 --> 01:17:18,899
  Oh, don't lie, the operator
  told me all about it.

914
01:17:18,901 --> 01:17:22,970
  You have tried to
  destroy the Institute
  ever since you arrived.

915
01:17:22,972 --> 01:17:26,907
  Then you used dear Ronnie
  to let you in here,

916
01:17:26,909 --> 01:17:31,245
  you flaunted yourself
  in front of David, undoing
  a work of a whole year!

917
01:17:31,247 --> 01:17:34,615
  But the final infamy
  was turning

918
01:17:34,617 --> 01:17:37,752
  Desmond Moore
  from his work, my work!

919
01:17:37,754 --> 01:17:39,620
              Your work?

920
01:17:39,622 --> 01:17:43,090
        Turning a hospital,
        a place of healing
       into a parody of therapy?

921
01:17:44,961 --> 01:17:48,763
        Yes, I was here
        and I used the phone.

922
01:17:48,765 --> 01:17:51,799
      I was also in the cellar.

923
01:17:51,801 --> 01:17:56,003
        You remember the cellar?
          You're buried there,
          so are the nurses.

    You were in the cellar?

            Yes, and in the
            basement room.

01:18:02,879 --> 01:18:05,146
              The one that
              doesn't exist!

          for Dr. Quilly!

            You did this!

953
01:19:49,418 --> 01:19:52,586
    You brought this all on!

954

            (GRUNTS)

955
01:20:05,935 --> 01:20:07,368
          Is he dead?

956
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:03,557
          DESMOND: Susan? Susan?

957
01:21:03,559 --> 01:21:05,659
              Are you all right?

958
01:21:05,661 --> 01:21:07,261
                It's Dr. Moore.

959
01:21:10,499 --> 01:21:13,267
          Dr. Quilly is alive.
          I just saw...

960
01:21:16,505 --> 01:21:19,306
  Oh, I'm sorry
  if I startled you.

961
01:21:19,308 --> 01:21:21,775
  It was just to
  honor Dr. Quilly.

962
01:21:30,486 --> 01:21:32,753
            Quite an effective
            performance, Henry.

963
01:21:32,755 --> 01:21:36,156
            Perhaps a bit
            too effective.
            Thank you, Henry.

964
01:21:37,593 --> 01:21:40,561
        Sometimes we see
        things not as they are,

965
01:21:40,563 --> 01:21:42,363
                 but as we would
                like them to be.

966
01:21:42,365 --> 01:21:45,766
            As I mentioned
            to Dr. Paul Swanson
            this morning.

967
01:21:55,378 --> 01:21:57,211
            You're saying you
            spoke with Paul?

968
01:21:57,213 --> 01:21:59,546
        Yes, I called him
        this morning.

969
01:21:59,548 --> 01:22:02,082
          It was sort of
          a hunch really.

970
01:22:02,084 --> 01:22:05,019
        And you'll be
        happy to know
        he's very much alive.

971
01:22:06,222 --> 01:22:07,922
                Alive?

972
01:22:07,924 --> 01:22:10,224
    You weren't his nurse,
    Susan, you were his patient.

973
01:22:10,226 --> 01:22:12,226
        You fell in love
        with him, it seems,

974
01:22:12,228 --> 01:22:15,396
        and because
        of falling in
        love with Paul,

975
01:22:15,398 --> 01:22:18,899
      he felt that
      another doctor should
      take over your treatment.

976
01:22:18,901 --> 01:22:21,735
      The rejection was
      too much for you to bear.

977
01:22:21,737 --> 01:22:25,272
      You imagined him dead
      and ran away

978
01:22:25,274 --> 01:22:27,141
      here to the Institute.

979
01:22:31,981 --> 01:22:33,881
    Maybe I should go back.

980
01:22:33,883 --> 01:22:36,417
          No, of course not.

981
01:22:36,419 --> 01:22:40,387
  The new head of the Institute
  needs a top notch nurse,
  doesn't he?

982
01:22:40,389 --> 01:22:43,223
        I'll be moving
        into my new office.

983
01:22:43,225 --> 01:22:45,459
      Maybe you'd like to help.

984
01:23:01,510 --> 01:23:03,410
              Thank you.

985
01:23:03,412 --> 01:23:07,247
        Needless to say
        the order and serenity

986
01:23:07,249 --> 01:23:10,317
    that Dr. Quilly brought
    to the Institute

987
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:14,421
      will be one of the most
      important priorities
      during my tenure here.

988
01:23:15,691 --> 01:23:18,559
    Ah, yes, Jones,
    set it right here, please.

989
01:23:21,130 --> 01:23:25,599
  Of course, it'll be
  very important during
  this transition period

990
01:23:25,601 --> 01:23:28,602
  that the rules
  of the Institute
  be strictly obeyed.

991
01:23:30,339 --> 01:23:33,674
  Jones here has
  agreed to stay on
  as head of security

992
01:23:33,676 --> 01:23:36,944
  and help us protect
  our way of life.

  Would you give me
  a hand here, please?

  Nothing like
  a touch of home
  in the office.

  Maybe you can help
  me arrange these.

      I saw a toy like this
      in the basement.

1001
01:24:34,170 --> 01:24:36,603
          It belonged
          to a patient.

  I want you to call a
  staff meeting for later,

  on the staff to attend.
