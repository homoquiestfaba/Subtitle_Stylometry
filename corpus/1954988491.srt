married her and made a family.

that something might happen.

you to argue that point first...

227

And you weren't quick to jump
to her defense.

I could grab the two of you?

Yes.
Oh, no, I was actually...

Because you're a demon
behind the wheel.

342
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,981
You're a fucking race car
driver, man.

343
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:16,983
Couldn't you find somebody
who does this for a living?

344
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:18,918
What is there,
a shortage of criminals?

345
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:23,723
Cannot trust criminals. They're
untrustworthy in every way.

346
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:25,892
(MUSIC CONTINUES)

347
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:27,994
All the bonds?
I'm afraid so.

348
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:30,397
From the safe?
Yes.

349
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,965
It could only be Keller.
Yes.

350
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:36,336
I want him dead
and whoever is with him.

351
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:37,937
Keep local law enforcement
out of it.

352
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,039
My friends on the force
have pulled back the net.

353
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,841
They're leaving him
to our security team.

354
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:42,942
Good, where are they?

355
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,448
Who are those guys?

356
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:52,552
They're like mercenaries.
Take a left.

357
00:21:04,531 --> 00:21:06,299
Found them.

358
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,868
Security has engaged.

359
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:11,904
Let me know when it's dead.

360
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:13,840
Those aren't fucking cops, man!

361
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:15,875
I told you that, don't
you ever listen to me.

362
00:21:15,908 --> 00:21:18,545
What the hell
kind of bank did you rob?

363
00:21:18,578 --> 00:21:21,614
Well, they're not a bank,
in any recognizable definition
of the word.

364
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,719
I'm gonna kill you.
I'm gonna kill you!

365
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:28,688
That's the spirit.

366
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:30,390
I'm gonna wring
your fucking neck.

367
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,561
Game time.

368
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:47,374
All right, hang on.

369
00:21:51,411 --> 00:21:52,479
Oh, my god.

370
00:22:10,397 --> 00:22:12,499
Jesus Christ!

371
00:22:12,532 --> 00:22:14,066
ANNOUNCER (V.O.):
Armed robbers raided...

372
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,768
The International
Bank & Trust this morning...

373
00:22:15,802 --> 00:22:18,037
Shortly after it opened...

374
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,939
Taking an undisclosed sum
of money and getting away
in a car...

375
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:22,108
Yeah, Mr. Rossi?

376
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:23,776
ANNOUNCER (V.O.):
Belonging to a driving
school. A witness said...

377
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:26,713
Yeah, I know, I realize that.

378
00:22:26,746 --> 00:22:29,949
If you find them,
you need to tell me.

379
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:33,753
Because we need to be there.
Police presence and all that.

380
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:39,859
They resisted. Officers had no
choice but to bring them down.

381
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:42,595
Yup, okay.
We'll be here.

382
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,769
They get them?
Not yet.

383
00:22:49,802 --> 00:22:51,804
Traffic cam says
they've headed north.

384
00:22:51,838 --> 00:22:54,574
So we need to put our men
where they won't get in the way.

385
00:22:54,607 --> 00:22:56,809
I've already taken care of it.

386
00:22:56,843 --> 00:22:58,110
Good boy.

387
00:22:58,144 --> 00:23:00,713
Shouldn't take long,
spot on back.

388
00:23:00,747 --> 00:23:02,549
All right, listen up!

389
00:23:02,582 --> 00:23:05,885
Now you all have your
assignments, yeah?

390
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:08,855
So let's get out there
and catch these bloody wankers.

391
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:12,158
Any idea who these wankers are?

392
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:13,826
[CHIEF INSPECTOR]
Who are you?

393
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:17,497
Agent Walker, Federal Police,
Major Crime Squad.

394
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:20,199
This is my associate,
Agent Brown.

395
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,501
This is a state matter.

396
00:23:21,534 --> 00:23:23,570
Not anymore.

397
00:23:23,603 --> 00:23:25,438
You see, The International
Bank & Trust are under
investigation...

398
00:23:25,472 --> 00:23:27,740
For money laundering
and tax fraud.

399
00:23:27,774 --> 00:23:32,812
Well, I don't know anything
about that, but this
is an armed robbery.

400
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:36,549
Pure and simple.
It's our jurisdiction.

401
00:23:39,185 --> 00:23:43,022
I know who you are...
and what you are...

402
00:23:43,055 --> 00:23:44,924
Chief Inspector.

403
00:23:44,957 --> 00:23:49,796
From now on, you and
your men, work for me.

404
00:23:49,829 --> 00:23:52,164
(CHUCKLES)

405
00:23:52,198 --> 00:23:53,933
If you've got a problem
with that, I suggest you call...

406
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:56,569
Commissioner Rogerson
in Canberra.

407
00:23:56,603 --> 00:23:58,538
I know he'd love
to hear from you.

408
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:07,480
All right... you're the boss.

409
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:12,719
You hear that?

410
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:16,723
Federal Special Agent Walker
is now in charge of this
investigation.

411
00:24:16,756 --> 00:24:24,063
Now I want you all to give her
your full cooperation,
all right?

412
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:28,668
Let's get out of here.

413
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:36,242
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
what do we have so far?

414
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,768
You like it?

415
00:25:01,801 --> 00:25:02,869
It's great.

416
00:25:02,902 --> 00:25:06,172
Dual banger, overhead cam.

417
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:07,840
More your style, isn't it?

418
00:25:07,874 --> 00:25:09,609
Yeah, yeah. It's okay.

419
00:25:09,642 --> 00:25:11,911
Okay? Bullshit.

420
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:13,980
It's beautiful.

421
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,848
Get in, we'll try it out.

422
00:25:15,882 --> 00:25:18,084
No, no, I'm not going.

423
00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:19,986
Yes, you are.

424
00:25:21,153 --> 00:25:23,155
Get in, partner.

425
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:24,691
You heard what I said,
I'm not your partner.

426
00:25:24,724 --> 00:25:25,958
Get in the car.

427
00:25:25,992 --> 00:25:29,328
Listen, I'm gonna walk
out of here, okay?

428
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:33,099
And there's nothing you can
do or say that's gonna change
my mind.

429
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:36,603
How about, try it
and I'll shoot you?

430
00:25:36,636 --> 00:25:38,337
You're not gonna shoot me.

431
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,740
Well, I sort of have to,
otherwise you won't take
me seriously.

432
00:25:40,773 --> 00:25:42,909
You shoot me, you're not
gonna have a driver.

433
00:25:42,942 --> 00:25:45,311
I'll improvise.

434
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:46,813
Okay.
Get in the car.

435
00:25:46,846 --> 00:25:49,148
Okay.

436
00:25:50,917 --> 00:25:52,619
I can't get in the car.

437
00:25:52,652 --> 00:25:53,953
Yes, you can.
No, I can't.

438
00:25:53,986 --> 00:25:55,988
I'll explain it to you.

439
00:25:56,022 --> 00:25:58,591
Gotta get out of here.
I'm turning around,
I'm walking out of here.

440
00:25:58,625 --> 00:25:59,892
Roberts...
I'm sorry.

441
00:25:59,926 --> 00:26:01,293
Roberts.
Hey, have fun in jail, okay.

442
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:08,100
Jesus! Ow! Fuck!

443
00:26:08,134 --> 00:26:09,902
God, you shot me!

444
00:26:09,936 --> 00:26:14,173
Yeah, I had to, you know,
that's the whole point.

445
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:16,142
God!
Why are you surprised?

446
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:18,277
I told you,
I'm about to shoot you.

447
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,146
What the fuck
did you shoot me with?

448
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:23,716
Rubber bullet, Russian 9
millimeter, self-defense.

449
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,653
I use it for when I'm mildly
pissed off. I use these
when I'm serious.

450
00:26:26,686 --> 00:26:30,389
I can't... I can't feel my ass.

451
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,992
Well, it's supposed to hurt,
otherwise it's not a deterrent.

452
00:26:37,664 --> 00:26:39,298
You think this is funny?
No.

453
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:42,368
Is that what this is about?
Man, let's go.

454
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:45,071
Let's... let's do it.
Let's do it. We're gonna do it.

455
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:47,073
Put 'em up, pal!
Put that rubber gun down.

456
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:49,041
Come on. Up.

457
00:26:50,743 --> 00:26:51,844
Come on.

458
00:26:55,882 --> 00:26:57,684
Jesus! Ow!

459
00:26:57,717 --> 00:26:59,719
Come on, be reasonable, man.

460
00:26:59,752 --> 00:27:02,254
You're a hostage.
You had no choice.

461
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:04,757
I put a gun to your head.

462
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:07,426
All you gotta do is get me where
I want to go and you're free
as a bird, you skate.

463
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,895
You're a maniac.

464
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:11,998
Hold on. Hold on.

465
00:27:12,031 --> 00:27:16,068
Look, look, look, hey, hey.

466
00:27:16,102 --> 00:27:19,939
Inside this case is $9 million.

467
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:23,976
You get me to where I want to
go, three of it is yours.

468
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:27,914
You got $9 million in that case?

469
00:27:27,947 --> 00:27:31,718
Suddenly he's interested?
No?

470
00:27:31,751 --> 00:27:33,285
How... who's gonna
believe me, huh?

471
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:34,921
Why wouldn't they believe you?

472
00:27:34,954 --> 00:27:37,223
You're a solid citizen.
I cased you, man.

473
00:27:37,256 --> 00:27:39,692
You got no criminal record,
no prior.

474
00:27:39,726 --> 00:27:42,428
What kind of stupid
do you think I am?

475
00:27:42,461 --> 00:27:45,732
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

476
00:27:55,307 --> 00:27:59,378
I got a question. How do you fit
$9 million in that little,
black case?

477
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:03,415
Bearer bonds, bearer bonds,
my friend, right?

478
00:28:03,449 --> 00:28:05,151
All right.
Just as good as cash...

479
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:08,054
Only easier to carry, negotiable
at any bank in the world.

480
00:28:08,087 --> 00:28:11,090
Although I suggest you avoid
The International Bank & Trust.

481
00:28:11,123 --> 00:28:12,925
And you're gonna give me
three of them?

482
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:14,927
That's what I said.

483
00:28:14,961 --> 00:28:17,396
Huh, so I don't know, man,
but I didn't...

484
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,766
Don't ask any questions,
Mr. Roberts.

485
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:23,069
You're gonna be a rich man
if you just drive me where
I want to go.

486
00:28:23,102 --> 00:28:26,072
No, no, no, I think I have
a right to know exactly what
the hell's going on...

487
00:28:26,105 --> 00:28:29,208
Or at least part of the story,
or at least the courtesy...

488
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:32,178
Oh, I'll tell you the goddamn
truth. I'll tell you
the goddamn truth.

489
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:35,414
I owe you that. I owe you
that much and you're right
about that, all right.

490
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:38,050
A man I used to work with
is named Mario Rossi.

491
00:28:38,084 --> 00:28:40,186
He's an American.
Sounds Italian.

492
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:45,324
He's not. He runs the Australian
end of an international crime
syndicate...

493
00:28:45,357 --> 00:28:48,795
Re-banking ring,
here on the Gold Coast.

494
00:28:48,828 --> 00:28:51,764
It's all very corporate
and very civilized.

495
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:54,767
You see, whatever money they
couldn't steal out of the U.S...

496
00:28:54,801 --> 00:28:59,371
Whatever money they couldn't
put in their wallets or eat
or shove up their asses...

497
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:01,240
Well, they just had
to have more.

498
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:03,910
So they came here and bought
a few investment banks.

499
00:29:03,943 --> 00:29:05,544
Okay, wait...
You following me?

500
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:09,949
You're talking about bad guys
buying banks like Merrill Lynch?

501
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:11,951
Like Bank of America?
Yeah.

502
00:29:11,984 --> 00:29:14,453
So these rent-a-cops who were
trying to kill us back there...

503
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,288
You're saying work for the bank?

504
00:29:16,322 --> 00:29:18,224
Yeah, they were corporate
assassins.

505
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:20,960
Bank assassins?
That's right. That's right.

506
00:29:20,993 --> 00:29:23,295
And they... they want their
money back, obviously.

507
00:29:23,329 --> 00:29:24,964
You're a brilliant man.

508
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:27,366
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
they wanted their money back.

509
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:30,436
Okay.
$9 million is peanuts
to a guy like Rossi, right?

510
00:29:30,469 --> 00:29:32,271
But these guys
are very old school.

511
00:29:32,304 --> 00:29:34,573
They like to whack each other
over shit like that, right?

512
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,876
They're very thin-skinned
individuals.

513
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:39,178
No, no, no, they're very
sensitive, yeah, but that
doesn't explain...

514
00:29:39,211 --> 00:29:42,181
You said that they owe you
money. How do they owe you?

515
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:43,482
Well, that's where
the story gets good.

516
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:45,985
You ever hear a
"Eye of the Fountain"?

517
00:29:46,018 --> 00:29:47,153
No.

518
00:29:47,186 --> 00:29:49,421
It's a diamond.
Yeah?

519
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:53,225
A big, fucking diamond that
used to be on display
in the Tower of London...

520
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:56,028
Until a wealthy Saudi
collector purchased it.

521
00:29:56,062 --> 00:29:59,465
Rossi financed the operation
for me to abscond the jewel...

522
00:29:59,498 --> 00:30:01,367
Which is worth a quarter
of a billion dollars.

523
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,502
Wait, wait, did you say
quarter of a billion?

524
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:05,371
Quarter of a billion dollars.
Dollars?

525
00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:08,207
Yup.
Jesus Christ.

526
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,208
So you're a pretty good thief.

527
00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:10,576
I'm an excellent one.

528
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:14,413
Now Mr. Rossi financed
the deal, then he set me up.

529
00:30:14,446 --> 00:30:16,582
I had to do some time.

530
00:30:16,615 --> 00:30:18,484
Well, I don't understand
why you even need Rossi
in the first place.

531
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:20,286
Why don't you sell it?

532
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,188
Because you can't just move
the Eye of the Fountain.

533
00:30:22,221 --> 00:30:24,857
You know, you need connections,
uh, to do something like that.

534
00:30:24,891 --> 00:30:26,058
Me, I just steal shit.

535
00:30:26,092 --> 00:30:27,994
Anyway, I did some prison time.

536
00:30:28,027 --> 00:30:29,561
I got out recently on good
behavior.

537
00:30:29,595 --> 00:30:32,198
Here?
No, no, no, in America.

538
00:30:32,231 --> 00:30:34,366
But this is the first time I've
ever been to the Gold Coast.

539
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,601
It's very beautiful.

540
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:37,269
Yeah, it's a lucky country,
all right.

541
00:30:37,303 --> 00:30:39,105
[KELLER]
We're headed north, partner.

542
00:30:39,138 --> 00:30:40,873
ANNOUNCER (V.O.):
Armed robbers raided...

543
00:30:40,907 --> 00:30:42,374
The International
Bank & Trust this morning...

544
00:30:42,408 --> 00:30:44,877
Shortly after it opened...

545
00:30:44,911 --> 00:30:47,479
Taking an undisclosed sum
of money and getting away
in a car...

546
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:50,182
Belonging to a driving
school.

547
00:30:50,216 --> 00:30:55,154
The suspect has been identified
as Peter Roberts, a driving
instructor for Drivers Wanted.

548
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:57,890
Police say Roberts and an
accomplice held up...

549
00:30:57,924 --> 00:31:00,026
The International Bank & Trust
this morning...

550
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:02,294
And got away with an
undisclosed sum of money.

551
00:31:02,328 --> 00:31:05,497
Both men are considered
armed and dangerous.

552
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:07,633
Tessa.
Lucy, it's a mistake.

553
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:09,101
Of course, it is.
It's a mistake.

554
00:31:09,135 --> 00:31:10,602
You need to sit down.

555
00:31:10,636 --> 00:31:12,371
No, no, I have to speak...
I have to talk to him.

556
00:31:12,404 --> 00:31:15,274
Can I take you home?
Where's Rebecca?

557
00:31:15,307 --> 00:31:16,442
Oh, my god.

558
00:31:16,475 --> 00:31:17,509
Tessa!

559
00:31:25,284 --> 00:31:27,619
Fuck, Peter, are you
out of your mind?

560
00:31:27,653 --> 00:31:30,022
What have you done?

561
00:31:30,056 --> 00:31:32,124
Where are you?
Call me.

562
00:31:36,195 --> 00:31:38,530
Phoebe, just...
Just get it done, okay?

563
00:31:38,564 --> 00:31:41,300
I was just about to call you.

564
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:43,035
Sit down.

565
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:45,404
You want to try to explain
to me what happened here?

566
00:31:45,437 --> 00:31:48,474
Well, it's fairly simple.
Someone held up the bank.

567
00:31:48,507 --> 00:31:50,676
And you have no idea
who these men are?

568
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:53,545
No. Why, should I?

569
00:31:56,182 --> 00:31:58,650
I know you understand how
important it is...

570
00:31:58,684 --> 00:32:01,287
That we resolve this
as quickly as possible.

571
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,623
I can assure you,
we have things well in hand.

572
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:10,062
And that nothing, nothing leads
back to me or the organization.

573
00:32:10,096 --> 00:32:11,330
Do we understand each other?

574
00:32:11,363 --> 00:32:13,199
That won't happen, okay?

575
00:32:13,232 --> 00:32:15,267
Can I get you something?
Would you like a drink?

576
00:32:15,301 --> 00:32:18,104
A drink?
I don't like you, Rossi.

577
00:32:18,137 --> 00:32:20,306
I have never liked you.

578
00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:22,674
Now I let them talk me into
putting you into a position...

579
00:32:22,708 --> 00:32:25,277
Of more responsibility than
I thought you could handle...

580
00:32:25,311 --> 00:32:27,479
And that was a mistake...
on my part.

581
00:32:27,513 --> 00:32:31,383
I will make all of this
go away, all right?
You have my word.

582
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:34,053
Your word?

583
00:32:34,086 --> 00:32:38,424
As if anybody's word ever meant
anything to anyone around here.

584
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:46,098
If I don't hear from you in,
say 24 hours...

585
00:32:46,132 --> 00:32:49,001
I'll assume
you're no longer with us.

586
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:55,441
Did something happen to Daddy?

587
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:57,376
No, we're just going
on a little holiday, honey.

588
00:32:57,409 --> 00:32:58,777
Did Daddy die?

589
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,179
No, of course not,
why would you say that?

590
00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:01,780
Terrorists?

591
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,982
No, he's fine, Daddy's fine,
just get in the car, okay?

592
00:33:06,552 --> 00:33:08,720
Mom?
Yeah.

593
00:33:11,357 --> 00:33:13,159
Give me that.

594
00:33:13,192 --> 00:33:14,493
Daddy robbed a bank.

595
00:33:14,526 --> 00:33:16,262
No, he didn't, they just
got it wrong, okay?

596
00:33:16,295 --> 00:33:18,764
Daddy robbed a bank.
Daddy robbed a bank.

597
00:33:18,797 --> 00:33:20,299
Stop it!
He did not rob a bank.

598
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:21,567
Yes, he did.

599
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,770
He would never rob a bank.
Yes, he would.

600
00:33:24,803 --> 00:33:26,004
Oh, my god.

601
00:33:30,209 --> 00:33:32,244
Go!
Tessa, get out of here!

602
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:59,771
All right, now what we're doing
is we're gonna follow this road
north to Mount Tamborine.

603
00:33:59,805 --> 00:34:03,642
We're just gonna stay
on the back roads,
observe the speed limit.

604
00:34:03,675 --> 00:34:05,444
We're gonna keep a low profile.

605
00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:08,714
Seatbelts. We should
put our seatbelts on.

606
00:34:08,747 --> 00:34:10,316
Out here?

607
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:11,750
Well, if you're saying
keep a low profile...

608
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:14,420
I mean, the cops do come out
here at some point, right?

609
00:34:14,453 --> 00:34:16,155
All right, all right.
They see us, they pull us over.

610
00:34:16,188 --> 00:34:19,258
I'm putting mine on.

611
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:22,294
You know what? This is not
even fucking working.

612
00:34:22,328 --> 00:34:24,530
I couldn't even put this
on if I wanted to.

613
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:27,599
I don't know, man, your plan's
falling apart, pal.

614
00:34:27,633 --> 00:34:31,803
Cop sees us, we're not wearing
our seatbelts, this could
be a disaster.

615
00:34:31,837 --> 00:34:34,340
No, don't worry about it.
We'll be fine.

616
00:34:34,373 --> 00:34:35,707
I got this.

617
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:37,709
All right, so assuming
I do take your money, right?

618
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:39,111
Yeah, assuming.
Assuming...

619
00:34:39,145 --> 00:34:41,713
How am I gonna spend any
of that money...

620
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:45,751
Your invisible money that
you've got, if I'm in prison?

621
00:34:45,784 --> 00:34:47,553
You're not gonna go to jail.
I'm just wondering.

622
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:49,721
No, no, no.
Are you sure about that?

623
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:51,723
Yeah, you might get killed,
or we both might get killed...

624
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:53,659
But nobody's going to jail,
I promise.

625
00:34:53,692 --> 00:34:57,229
How the fuck am I gonna convince
anybody that I'm a hostage here?

626
00:34:57,263 --> 00:34:58,564
I got that figured out.

627
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,399
You mind sharing?

628
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:03,702
Yeah, it's easy.
We call the Feds, right?

629
00:35:03,735 --> 00:35:08,674
And we tell them, you tell
them, "Hey, I'm a hostage.
I'm a hostage."

630
00:35:08,707 --> 00:35:11,543
I got taken over.
This guy is totally psychotic.

631
00:35:11,577 --> 00:35:13,512
In fact, we can do it
right now.

632
00:35:13,545 --> 00:35:15,381
Uh, you know, pull over.
Now?

633
00:35:15,414 --> 00:35:17,516
But let me get... let me check
and see if I can get a signal.

634
00:35:17,549 --> 00:35:19,218
No.
Here?

635
00:35:19,251 --> 00:35:21,753
No, uh, keep going.

636
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:24,290
Did my daddy really rob a bank?

637
00:35:24,323 --> 00:35:25,924
You must be Rebecca, right?

638
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,693
Yup.

639
00:35:27,726 --> 00:35:29,661
I'll tell you what, when we
get this all figured out...

640
00:35:29,695 --> 00:35:31,930
I'll give you an official
briefing, okay?

641
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,233
Cool.
Go.

642
00:35:36,735 --> 00:35:38,837
Can we sit down?

643
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,839
Sure.

644
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,583
Has your husband ever mentioned
the name Simon Keller?

645
00:35:51,617 --> 00:35:54,653
Keller, no, at least
I don't think so.

646
00:35:54,686 --> 00:35:58,624
Have you ever met this man
before?

647
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:00,526
I've never seen him before.

648
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:02,894
Your husband never
mentioned his name?

649
00:36:02,928 --> 00:36:05,664
No.

650
00:36:05,697 --> 00:36:06,965
Your husband used to
race cars, yes?

651
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,367
That's right.

652
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,236
And now he's a driving
instructor?

653
00:36:10,269 --> 00:36:11,937
Part-time for what it's worth.

654
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:14,706
So, he wasn't bringing
in much money then.

655
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,408
That doesn't mean that he...

656
00:36:16,442 --> 00:36:19,411
Your husband has been recorded
driving the getaway vehicle.

657
00:36:19,445 --> 00:36:25,317
I know, I've seen some of the
footage, but there has to be
an explanation.

658
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:27,386
Look, I really shouldn't
be talking to you.

659
00:36:27,419 --> 00:36:28,854
Mrs. Roberts, we're just
trying to help you.

660
00:36:28,887 --> 00:36:30,356
You're trying to put
my husband in jail.

661
00:36:30,389 --> 00:36:31,690
Right now, we're just
trying to find him.

662
00:36:31,723 --> 00:36:33,725
Yeah, so you're on our side.

663
00:36:33,759 --> 00:36:36,562
Mr. Keller is a career criminal,
Mrs. Roberts.

664
00:36:36,595 --> 00:36:39,831
Your husband is in grave danger,
and if we don't find him...

665
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:45,704
If he calls you, I need you
to contact me immediately.

666
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:47,773
We'll see.

667
00:36:47,806 --> 00:36:49,975
In the meantime, we'll assign
an officer to stay with you
at all times.

668
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:51,410
That won't be necessary.

669
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:52,711
I don't agree.

670
00:36:55,347 --> 00:36:58,450
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

671
00:37:09,027 --> 00:37:10,762
What the hell is going on here?

672
00:37:10,796 --> 00:37:13,865
Hey, hey, who are you people and
what are you doing in my bank?

673
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:15,534
Mr. Rossi, I presume.

674
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:18,270
I'm Agent Walker, Federal
Police, Major Crime Squad.

675
00:37:18,304 --> 00:37:19,838
This is my associate,
Agent Brown.

676
00:37:19,871 --> 00:37:21,807
What's going on?

677
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:25,844
This is a warrant. We're gonna
take a look at your books,
Mr. Rossi.

678
00:37:25,877 --> 00:37:28,614
I don't understand.
Is this an audit?

679
00:37:28,647 --> 00:37:30,849
You could call it that.

680
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:33,952
Fail to understand how our being
robbed would entail this
sort of thing...

681
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:36,021
But I assure you,
everything is in order.

682
00:37:36,054 --> 00:37:38,357
Well, we'll see.

683
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:40,926
In the meantime, I presume
you've had a look at the
surveillance footage.

684
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:43,662
What can you tell me
about this man Keller?

685
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:46,798
Never met the man.
No idea who he is.

686
00:37:46,832 --> 00:37:50,436
That's the way you want
to play it, fine.

687
00:37:50,469 --> 00:37:53,071
We find him, I'm sure he'll have
a different story to tell.

688
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:57,809
When you do find him,
I'll be more than happy to
cooperate in every way possible.

689
00:37:57,843 --> 00:38:02,348
When we do find him,
I'm sure you won't be around.

690
00:38:02,381 --> 00:38:04,450
I'm sure I don't know
what you mean.

691
00:38:04,483 --> 00:38:07,686
No, of course, not.

692
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:19,998
All right, now we're gonna
call Major Crime Squad.

693
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:21,600
Good.

694
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:23,535
Right there on speed dial.
Just press that.

695
00:38:23,569 --> 00:38:25,371
Oh, okay.
Hey, look, I'll do it.

696
00:38:25,404 --> 00:38:26,638
Hold on.
I can do it.

697
00:38:26,672 --> 00:38:28,340
No, I got it.

698
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:37,683
May I speak with someone
in Major Crime Squad, please?

699
00:38:37,716 --> 00:38:40,085
Yes, I'll hold.

700
00:38:40,118 --> 00:38:43,355
You serious? We're really
gonna talk to somebody
in Major Crime?

701
00:38:43,389 --> 00:38:44,490
Yeah, they're gonna get
on the phone now.

702
00:38:44,523 --> 00:38:46,392
What the fuck
am I gonna tell them?

703
00:38:46,425 --> 00:38:48,627
You tell them you're being held
hostage. I took you at gunpoint.

704
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,462
I'm a psychopath.

705
00:38:50,496 --> 00:38:53,432
So, the truth.
Yeah, tell them the truth.

706
00:38:53,465 --> 00:38:56,535
Hello, hello, hi, um, yes.

707
00:38:56,568 --> 00:39:00,539
Ah, my name is Peter Roberts...

708
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:04,109
And I am a hostage.

709
00:39:04,142 --> 00:39:09,415
I'm a getaway driver.
I mean, I've been forced
to be a getaway driver.

710
00:39:09,448 --> 00:39:13,151
That's why I'm calling, because
there was a bank robbery, yes.

711
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:16,522
Downtown, and then yeah,
so I was like, you know...

712
00:39:16,555 --> 00:39:19,725
A driving instructor, right?
And I'm teaching this guy
how to drive...

713
00:39:19,758 --> 00:39:23,962
Which he already fucking knows
how to drive, which, I figured
that out, by the way.

714
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:25,764
You got away,
you found the phone.

715
00:39:25,797 --> 00:39:28,033
I found a phone.
I got away.

716
00:39:28,066 --> 00:39:32,871
And I'm... wait, I'm having
trouble talking.

717
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,875
That's better... sorry.

718
00:39:36,908 --> 00:39:40,011
What? Hey, whoa.
What? Hey!

719
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,949
What the fuck was that?
Fuck.

720
00:39:43,982 --> 00:39:46,485
That was fucking garbage.

721
00:39:46,518 --> 00:39:49,821
Yeah, sorry, I'm just
not used to this...

722
00:39:49,855 --> 00:39:53,492
You didn't...
That was really overreactive.

723
00:39:53,525 --> 00:39:56,094
Well, I have to destroy
the phone anyway,
it's a throw away.

724
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:59,431
You want to try that again?

725
00:39:59,465 --> 00:40:00,599
You're the boss.

726
00:40:00,632 --> 00:40:02,000
Okay.

727
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:09,441
Hello, may I speak with
the Major Crime Squad?

728
00:40:09,475 --> 00:40:12,444
Yeah, hello.

729
00:40:12,478 --> 00:40:18,116
Uh, yes, hi, my name is Peter
Roberts and I am the hostage.

730
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:22,454
I've been held hostage by a very
crazy man, a bank robber...

731
00:40:22,488 --> 00:40:26,725
Who is really nuts, and he stole
my car. I'm a driving
instructor.

732
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:28,827
You probably heard about
this thing downtown.

733
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:31,997
I'm really... I'm really cold...

734
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:35,467
And I'm scared! I'm really
fucking scared that this guy...

735
00:40:35,501 --> 00:40:40,038
Might blow my fucking brains
out if you don't come
and help me, okay!

736
00:40:40,071 --> 00:40:43,041
I don't know where the fuck we
are! He's got me blindfolded.

737
00:40:43,074 --> 00:40:44,743
Keep what?

738
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:47,513
Ow!

739
00:40:47,546 --> 00:40:48,747
That was good.

740
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,749
Jesus fucking Christ!

741
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:54,586
I took the mag out, okay?
Nothing in the chamber.

742
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,821
You suck as an actor.

743
00:40:55,854 --> 00:40:57,789
You almost killed me.
You know that?

744
00:40:57,823 --> 00:41:00,091
I didn't kill anybody.
Let's go, let's hit the road.

745
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:02,728
I can't wait
to go back to school.

746
00:41:02,761 --> 00:41:05,731
Everybody is gonna be
so jealous.

747
00:41:05,764 --> 00:41:07,599
Becca, this is not something
to be proud of, okay?

748
00:41:07,633 --> 00:41:10,168
But, Mom,
he was on television.

749
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:11,737
That is so cool.

750
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:13,004
Yeah.

751
00:41:13,038 --> 00:41:14,706
(PHONE RINGS)

752
00:41:17,643 --> 00:41:18,777
Hello?

753
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:23,014
Tess? Baby, hey.
It's me.

754
00:41:23,048 --> 00:41:24,015
[PETER]
How you doing?

755
00:41:24,049 --> 00:41:25,584
Where are you?

756
00:41:25,617 --> 00:41:28,053
I'm... I'm on the road, honey.
How are you?

757
00:41:28,086 --> 00:41:31,189
How's Becca? Did she hear
about what happened?

758
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:33,725
She knows, believe me,
she knows.

759
00:41:33,759 --> 00:41:35,060
What have you done, Peter?

760
00:41:35,093 --> 00:41:37,529
What have I...
Tessa, now wait a second.

761
00:41:37,563 --> 00:41:41,667
Now you don't actually think
that I... I robbed a bank,
do you?

762
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,869
I mean, that's not...
You were driving the car.

763
00:41:43,902 --> 00:41:46,137
No, no, no...
Honey, I'm a hostage.

764
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:48,006
The guy took me hostage.

765
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:50,542
I was giving him a driving
lesson and the next thing
I know...

766
00:41:50,576 --> 00:41:52,077
We were being chased
by the cops.

767
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:54,245
This was Mr. Keller,
I presume?

768
00:41:54,279 --> 00:41:55,914
No.

769
00:41:55,947 --> 00:41:58,249
The Feds were here.

770
00:41:58,283 --> 00:42:00,085
There's a cop in our house,
as we speak.

771
00:42:00,118 --> 00:42:02,554
Oh, no, no, no,
I... Tessa...

772
00:42:02,588 --> 00:42:04,723
Tessa, you can't trust
the cops, okay?

773
00:42:04,756 --> 00:42:06,558
I don't want you
to tell them anything.

774
00:42:06,592 --> 00:42:08,694
I want you to get the kid
and get out of there.

775
00:42:08,727 --> 00:42:10,996
I'm not going anywhere,
Peter.

776
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:12,163
Tell me you
didn't rob that bank.

777
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:16,034
Honey, I did not
rob the bank.

778
00:42:16,067 --> 00:42:17,669
I don't believe you.

779
00:42:17,703 --> 00:42:19,671
What is there not to believe?
Give me that phone!

780
00:42:19,705 --> 00:42:21,006
What the f... hey!

781
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,809
Was that Daddy?

782
00:42:26,778 --> 00:42:28,814
She doesn't respect you, man.

783
00:42:28,847 --> 00:42:30,115
She respects me.

784
00:42:30,148 --> 00:42:31,617
No, she doesn't.

785
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:33,251
Yes, she does.

786
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:35,353
No, she didn't even believe you!
She didn't believe you!

787
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:38,156
I didn't believe you!
You sound like a pussy!

788
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:43,328
You want to know why
she doesn't respect you?

789
00:42:43,361 --> 00:42:46,131
No.
Okay... forget it.

790
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:49,668
All right, why?

791
00:42:49,701 --> 00:42:53,004
She doesn't respect you,
because you were a great
driver and you quit.

792
00:42:53,038 --> 00:42:55,073
You were on the edge,
you were living on the edge...

793
00:42:55,106 --> 00:42:57,609
And you were good at it,
and that's why she liked you.

794
00:42:57,643 --> 00:43:00,912
And now, you gave it up,
and she doesn't respect you.

795
00:43:00,946 --> 00:43:03,982
All right,
let me think about this.

796
00:43:04,015 --> 00:43:05,250
Let's see, why did I quit?

797
00:43:05,283 --> 00:43:06,952
Yeah, why'd you quit?

798
00:43:06,985 --> 00:43:11,389
Oh, yeah, because she told me
to! That's why I quit!

799
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,324
Well, that's the first mistake.

800
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:15,360
You can't listen
to what they say!

801
00:43:15,393 --> 00:43:17,262
They don't want you
to do what they say!

802
00:43:17,295 --> 00:43:18,697
Unbelievable.

803
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:21,132
That's fucking, uh,
Woman 101.

804
00:43:23,134 --> 00:43:26,738
I was in love with a Korean
girl, but she had the Han.

805
00:43:26,772 --> 00:43:28,406
What the fuck is a Han?

806
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:32,277
Oh, it's this ancient kind
of thing with Korean women.

807
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:34,713
The women become like
Lady Vengeance.

808
00:43:34,746 --> 00:43:37,415
They try to kill you,
and they can't help
themselves...

809
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,751
Because of years of oppression.

810
00:43:39,785 --> 00:43:42,821
I didn't know going in,
and I learned a lot.

811
00:43:42,854 --> 00:43:44,189
It's a cultural thing?
Yeah, yeah.

812
00:43:46,157 --> 00:43:48,960
Hey, uh, where'd you
get this car?

813
00:43:48,994 --> 00:43:52,698
I got this car
with money that I stole.

814
00:43:52,731 --> 00:43:55,400
Well, you got ripped off.

815
00:43:55,433 --> 00:43:56,735
What do you mean?

816
00:43:56,768 --> 00:43:58,704
It looks like we're overheating.

817
00:43:58,737 --> 00:44:00,872
Fuck me.

818
00:44:00,906 --> 00:44:03,308
ANNOUNCER (V.O.):
The suspect has been
identified as Peter Roberts...

819
00:44:03,341 --> 00:44:06,077
A driving instructor
from Driver's Wanted.

820
00:44:06,111 --> 00:44:08,246
Police say Roberts
and an accomplice held up...

821
00:44:08,279 --> 00:44:10,949
The International Bank & Trust
this morning and made off...

822
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:13,284
That's my dad!

823
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:14,986
Footage of the car chase
demonstrates...

824
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:16,287
Whoo-hoo!
Remarkable driving skills...

825
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:17,388
Of Roberts.

826
00:44:17,422 --> 00:44:22,761
Yeah! Go, Daddy, go!
Whoo!

827
00:44:22,794 --> 00:44:27,699
Jimmy Carter was President
the last time this car
has had an oil change.

828
00:44:37,242 --> 00:44:38,443
That's it,
that ought to do it.

829
00:44:38,476 --> 00:44:40,111
All right, here we go.

830
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:45,450
What the hell
are we gonna do here?

831
00:44:45,483 --> 00:44:47,886
We wait for somebody to show up,
and then we steal a car.

832
00:44:47,919 --> 00:44:49,888
Oh, another felony,
great, good.

833
00:44:53,458 --> 00:44:55,160
Fucking legs, man.

834
00:45:05,771 --> 00:45:08,774
Good afternoon, are you
here for the reception?

835
00:45:08,807 --> 00:45:09,975
Yes, we are.

836
00:45:10,008 --> 00:45:11,509
Well, you are early.

837
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:15,380
I know, I know,
do you mind if we wait?

838
00:45:15,413 --> 00:45:19,184
Not at all, you can wait
in there if you like,
until your friends arrive.

839
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:20,986
You're very kind.
Turn yourself in.

840
00:45:21,019 --> 00:45:23,388
We will turn ourselves in,
when we go to bed, sweetheart.

841
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:29,094
Um, anything you want,
you can just ask.

842
00:45:29,127 --> 00:45:30,261
Perhaps a refreshment.

843
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:33,899
Thanks.

844
00:45:33,932 --> 00:45:37,435
Feel free to steal whatever
you like, master criminal.

845
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:40,205
Just relax, Roberts,
and think what you're gonna
do with all that money.

846
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:41,907
Sorry, what money?

847
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:44,075
You'll get your cut.
Ah, right.

848
00:45:44,109 --> 00:45:45,443
I'm a thief, not a liar.

849
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:46,945
I never stiffed a partner
my whole life.

850
00:45:46,978 --> 00:45:48,013
How's that working out for you?

851
00:45:48,046 --> 00:45:49,280
What?
Being a thief.

852
00:45:49,314 --> 00:45:51,249
How is it to live like that?
Seriously.

853
00:45:51,282 --> 00:45:53,518
What, as opposed to you?

854
00:45:53,551 --> 00:45:55,253
You got balls, Keller,
I'll give you that.

855
00:45:55,286 --> 00:45:57,923
But not much else.

856
00:45:57,956 --> 00:46:00,859
Well, just because we're on
the run, doesn't mean we
have to live like savages.

857
00:46:00,892 --> 00:46:02,160
Can I get you a Chardonnay?

858
00:46:02,193 --> 00:46:03,995
No, no, thanks,
I'm the designated driver.

859
00:46:04,029 --> 00:46:05,496
I got a question for you.
Tell the truth.

860
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:07,165
I always tell the truth.

861
00:46:07,198 --> 00:46:09,167
Except when you're lyin'.
Yeah, except that.

862
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,270
How many people have you killed?
Hm? Murdered?

863
00:46:12,303 --> 00:46:14,405
Wiped off the face
of the earth. How many?

864
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:19,377
Listen, man, you better
be careful with that
grandmother back there.

865
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:23,081
That look in that bitch's eyes.
The abyss is in there, man.

866
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:26,484
That bitch is bat-shit crazy.
Don't fuck around with her.

867
00:46:26,517 --> 00:46:27,819

868

living soul, do you?

870

not that surprising really.

871
00:46:48,573 --> 00:46:51,142
They're usually more inevitable.

872
00:46:51,176 --> 00:46:54,579
Inevitably, they always
choose greed.

873
00:46:54,612 --> 00:46:57,949

life wasn't fair.

874

to Davos, Switzerland.

877

You know the economic
forum there?

878
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:30,215

their plans to succeed from
earth to outer space...

With the rest
of the ruling overlords.
You're crazy.

880
00:47:33,284 --> 00:47:36,888
The bastard was on a fast track
for a senior management position
at AIG...

881
00:47:36,922 --> 00:47:39,324
And we just fucked up
his plans.

882
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:41,893
So, you know what?
That feels really fucking good.

883
00:47:41,927 --> 00:47:43,194
All right,
you made your point.

884
00:47:43,228 --> 00:47:46,264

You want to call your wife?

887
00:47:50,969 --> 00:47:53,204
You want me to dial
the number for her? No?

is it?

889
00:47:54,339 --> 00:47:56,174
I really don't like you.

890
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:58,109
That's what happens when you try
to be someone you're not.

891
00:47:58,143 --> 00:48:00,445
What's that car doing out there?

892
00:48:00,478 --> 00:48:01,947
Oh, they're here
for the reception.

893
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:03,481
Really, they'll have to wait.

894
00:48:03,514 --> 00:48:06,217
I already told them that.
I know what I'm doing.

895

what that might be like?

Armed robbers raided...

904
00:48:29,207 --> 00:48:32,243
The International Bank & Trust
this morning shortly after it
opened.

905
00:48:32,277 --> 00:48:35,413
The robbers made off with close
to nine million dollars.

906
00:48:35,446 --> 00:48:39,584
Police, so far, have no clue
as to their whereabouts.

907

You must have been a real joy
to bring home to the family.

908
00:48:41,686 --> 00:48:43,621
You probably stole all
the silverware.

909
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:46,724
I'm gonna go out on a limb here
and say she dumped you. Right?

910
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,459
That what happened?

911
00:48:48,493 --> 00:48:50,028
She died.

00:48:54,332 --> 00:48:55,633
Fuck.

913
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:59,971
I'm sorry. Sorry.

914
00:49:00,005 --> 00:49:02,140
She didn't die.
She went back to Korea.

915

00:54:16,887 --> 00:54:18,589
You'll never make it.

1014
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:20,791
[KELLER]
Oh, no, I think I will.
Wanna bet?

1015
00:54:20,825 --> 00:54:22,460
How about a little,
friendly wager?

1016
00:54:22,493 --> 00:54:25,062
Okay, okay.

1017
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:27,965
So you wanted what was yours,
I understand...

1018
00:54:27,998 --> 00:54:29,934
But you took more than that,
Keller.

1019
00:54:29,967 --> 00:54:33,070
Call it interest...
five years' worth.

1020
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:37,074
Look, I realize you're a little
upset with the way things
turned out, but...

1021
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:39,043
You know we can
make it up to you.

1022
00:54:39,076 --> 00:54:40,711
So here's what I propose,
okay, guy?

1023
00:54:40,745 --> 00:54:42,847
How about this?

1024
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,351
I take your money and you wind
up dead in the desert
somewhere...

1025
00:54:46,384 --> 00:54:48,018
Or quivering like a toothache.

1026
00:54:48,052 --> 00:54:50,655
What are you talking about?
What are you off your meds?

1027
00:54:50,688 --> 00:54:53,591
You know there's a certain kind
of animal purity you can only
have with a woman...

1028
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:57,061
Who's fucked up,
and when I say fucked up,
I'm referring to your wife.

1029
00:54:57,094 --> 00:54:58,996
How is the little lady?

1030
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:01,732
That anorexic piece
of jet trash.

1031
00:55:01,766 --> 00:55:04,869
What the fuck? Why you gotta
talk about my wife, Keller?

1032
00:55:04,902 --> 00:55:07,104
Your wife, you know what she
reminded me of? She reminded me
of a fetus with a slingshot.

1033
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,073
What the fuck?

1034
00:55:09,106 --> 00:55:10,575
That's what she looks
like to me.
Come on, Keller.

1035
00:55:10,608 --> 00:55:12,810
You look like a dwarf.
She looks like a goblin.

1036
00:55:12,843 --> 00:55:13,878
Keller?
All right?

1037
00:55:13,911 --> 00:55:15,413
No, she looks like a hose beast.

1038
00:55:15,446 --> 00:55:17,682
A hose beast?
What the fuck is with you?

1039
00:55:17,715 --> 00:55:19,384
A hose beast.

1040
00:55:19,417 --> 00:55:22,720
That's a multi-tentacled demon.
Mythological.

1041
00:55:22,753 --> 00:55:25,623
Anyway, I know your love
is as pure as a cough drop...

1042
00:55:25,656 --> 00:55:28,793
But, you know,
she's a horrible witch.

1043
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:32,930
And I fucked her and I would
have rather fucked anything
than her.

1044
00:55:32,963 --> 00:55:35,132
Is that right?

1045
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:40,605
Well, how about you go
eat shit and die, asshole!

1046
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:49,146
A little hard on cell phones,
aren't you?

1047
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,115
Plenty more
where that came from.

1048
00:55:51,148 --> 00:55:55,786
All right, so that's the guy?
That's the guy who, uh...

1049
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:58,723
Turned you into jailhouse pussy?

1050
00:55:58,756 --> 00:56:01,926
I kept my virtue... barely...

1051
00:56:01,959 --> 00:56:03,828

He looks in, you wave to him.

1069
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:48,799
You tell him to come inside.

1070
00:57:48,833 --> 00:57:50,067
You don't want
to bring him in here.

when he comes in here...

to kill anybody, okay?

It's like I'm invisible.

fuck me anymore, okay?

1184
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:22,332
So, no.

1185
01:03:22,366 --> 01:03:24,234

1186
01:03:24,268 --> 01:03:26,036

our little adventure...

a few chuckles, but it's best.

to wherever the fuck it is
that you are going.

1191

that I am gonna do...

1192
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:45,322
And I do the things that I say
that I'm gonna do, all right?

1193
01:03:45,355 --> 01:03:46,957
That's something that I do.

1194
01:03:46,991 --> 01:03:48,058
But you never said you were
gonna do anything.

about him, you know?

1204
01:04:12,950 --> 01:04:15,052
He was a very dangerous man.

1205
01:04:15,085 --> 01:04:17,221
You know, not that I thought
he'd harm me in any way.

1206
01:04:17,254 --> 01:04:18,322
Quite the opposite.

1207
01:04:18,355 --> 01:04:20,557
He was very protective, but...

1208
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:22,426
I always
knew that underneath...

1209
01:04:22,459 --> 01:04:26,596
He was very animalistic,
you know? Very primal.

surprised to learn he may
actually have robbed a bank?

No, not at all.

1212
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:31,936
As I said, you know...

1213
01:04:31,969 --> 01:04:34,204
He was a very dangerous man...

1214
01:04:34,238 --> 01:04:36,173
And I loved him.

You were in love with him?

1216
01:04:38,308 --> 01:04:41,445
Well, yeah, you know, in a way.

1217
01:04:41,478 --> 01:04:43,948
I always thought we'd make
a good match and...

in love with Daddy.
