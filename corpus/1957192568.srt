Every day is your birthday,

00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:46,781
and today is the gift
of conversation.

9
00:00:46,814 --> 00:00:48,550
I don't want your conversation.

10
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:51,786
Your voice is making me
wanna pour Drano down my ears.

11
00:00:51,819 --> 00:00:54,656
Aww, that's the sweetest thing
you've ever said to me!

12
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:57,190

Can I help you?

19
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:16,209
I didn't mean

21
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:18,412
Okay.

Wait!

23
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:20,715
I took two Nyquil
and passed out.

24
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:23,518
I didn't wake up until
after midnight, I swear.

25
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:25,520
I put on normal clothes for you.

I'm sorry.

27
00:01:26,854 --> 00:01:30,792
But I got you Pedialyte
and a burrito.

28
00:01:30,825 --> 00:01:32,560
I think it's cheese.

29
00:01:32,594 --> 00:01:34,529
I assumed you might need it
after the very aggressive

30
00:01:34,562 --> 00:01:36,764
and slurred hate message
you left me.

31
00:01:36,798 --> 00:01:40,300
- Don't make any jokes.
- Right. Sorry.

32
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:42,202
Can I come in?

33
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:43,805
Please?

34
00:01:43,838 --> 00:01:47,508
You're, uh, glowing today,
by the way.

00:01:47,542 --> 00:01:49,242
You are! You're...
you're beautiful,

36

you're a queen,
I'm serious, please.

37
00:01:50,912 --> 00:01:52,379
If you do that again,

38
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:54,882
you better ingest
every Nyquil pill you own.

39
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:56,416
Done.

40
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,419
- I'm serious.
- I... fuckin' promise.

41
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:00,822
Okay, then,

gouge out his eyes

156
00:07:10,932 --> 00:07:12,900

his own testicles, you know?

you just gotta move on?

I suck at this game.

161
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:22,009
You gotta give
more hand jobs.

00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:26,647

with your sexuality.

174
00:07:42,063 --> 00:07:43,664
It has nothing to do

- Yes.

your sexuality.

deep-throat

- Junk jizz.

flew out of his dick

209
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:02,610

210

it was literally like

218
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:20,428
squeezing a tube of toothpaste.

219
00:09:20,461 --> 00:09:25,132
The jizz just, like, spiraled
out of the tip of his dick.

220

221

do this to me?

I need to start handling
my own prints,

230
00:09:44,318 --> 00:09:47,054

$2 through a third party.

231
00:09:47,088 --> 00:09:48,322
It's a total scam.

232

- Hm.
- Well, better start wearing

233
00:09:49,457 --> 00:09:52,393

and rack up that tip money.

234

Okay, yeah, first of all,
I don't have boobs,

you take your clothes off.

no one's wearing clothes.

the tip of my penis,

you lick it with your tongue.

And you're sucking on it,

514
00:25:48,249 --> 00:25:50,751
and you're gagging.

515
00:25:50,785 --> 00:25:52,319
You're gagging so loud,

516
00:25:52,353 --> 00:25:56,624

with it.

517
00:25:56,657 --> 00:25:58,759
I dick-slap you
right in the face,

518
00:25:58,793 --> 00:26:01,362

521
00:26:06,967 --> 00:26:09,637
And then I grab you
by the back of the hair

522
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:11,739
and I pull you up

523
00:26:11,772 --> 00:26:16,043
and I press your face
against the wall

524
00:26:16,077 --> 00:26:19,780
and I tell you
what a bad girl you've been.

525
00:26:19,814 --> 00:26:22,850
And you beg me
not to punish you,

526
00:26:22,883 --> 00:26:26,320
but bad girls need
to get punished.

527
00:26:26,353 --> 00:26:28,289

I spank you so hard,

529
00:26:30,958 --> 00:26:33,327
and you say,
"I'll be a good girl, Daddy,

530
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,262
I promise!"

531
00:26:35,296 --> 00:26:38,399

you said last time.

fuck it into you."

and it's dripping
down your nose,

545
00:27:14,702 --> 00:27:18,239
and it's all over
the filthy bathroom.

546
00:27:18,272 --> 00:27:20,808
And I look at you
and I say,

547
00:27:20,841 --> 00:27:24,145
"Look at the mess you made,
you dirty little bitch.

548
00:27:24,178 --> 00:27:26,981
Clean it up."

549
00:27:27,014 --> 00:27:29,750
(he exhales deeply)

550
00:27:31,218 --> 00:27:34,788
So was it as good
as the last time?

551
00:27:34,822 --> 00:27:36,924
Excuse me?

552
00:27:36,957 --> 00:27:38,425
Uh, the food.

553
00:27:38,459 --> 00:27:39,894
Full disclosure:

554
00:27:39,927 --> 00:27:40,961
I'm not trying to be creepy.

555
00:27:40,995 --> 00:27:42,062
I saw you here
the other day

556
00:27:42,096 --> 00:27:43,130
and I was gonna say something,

557
00:27:43,164 --> 00:27:44,899
but then I didn't,

558
00:27:44,932 --> 00:27:47,768
because I kinda find you
incredibly intimidating.

559
00:27:47,801 --> 00:27:49,737
You think I'm intimidating.

560
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:52,439
- Very much so.
- Wow.

561
00:27:52,473 --> 00:27:54,341
That's some poor judgment.

562
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:57,111
No, I think you need
to give yourself more credit.

563
00:27:57,144 --> 00:27:58,879
Well, I can't be
that intimidating

564
00:27:58,913 --> 00:28:00,848
with the quick turnaround.

565
00:28:00,881 --> 00:28:02,082
Oh... no, I had a beer.

566
00:28:02,116 --> 00:28:06,020
- Ah. The truth comes out.
- So it does.

567
00:28:11,926 --> 00:28:13,727
I'm Lowick.

568
00:28:13,761 --> 00:28:14,962
Morgan.

569
00:28:14,995 --> 00:28:16,363
Just so you know,

570
00:28:16,397 --> 00:28:19,333
I kinda consider myself
a pho connoisseur.

571
00:28:19,366 --> 00:28:22,870
That is...
that is painfully dorky.

572
00:28:22,903 --> 00:28:23,938
Speaking of,

573
00:28:23,971 --> 00:28:26,740
you are more than welcome
to come sit over here,

574
00:28:26,774 --> 00:28:28,175
if you want.

575
00:28:28,209 --> 00:28:29,476
Because you're eating alone

576
00:28:29,511 --> 00:28:32,279
and you look like
a total loser.

577
00:28:32,313 --> 00:28:34,516
You're eating alone.

578
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:35,916
Well, yeah, but I already have
the whole dork thing

579
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,117
going on pretty strong,

580
00:28:37,151 --> 00:28:38,919
so loser suits me.

581
00:28:38,953 --> 00:28:40,788
I do like sports, though.

582
00:28:40,821 --> 00:28:42,957
- I don't think that helps.
- Shit.

583
00:28:48,429 --> 00:28:50,164
You know what?

584
00:28:50,197 --> 00:28:52,032
Just forget I said anything.

585
00:28:52,066 --> 00:28:56,036
Or I... you look like
you've had a hard week.

586
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:58,105
So I'm... I'm gonna come
over there with this.

587
00:29:04,211 --> 00:29:05,246
Hi!

588
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,415
Hi.

589
00:29:08,449 --> 00:29:10,784
- You know what's crazy?
- What?

590
00:29:10,818 --> 00:29:12,453
Sitting at a table
with another human being

591
00:29:12,486 --> 00:29:14,822
can make you feel so much better
about your life.

592
00:29:14,855 --> 00:29:16,824
(chuckling)

593
00:29:16,857 --> 00:29:18,192
So what happened?

594
00:29:18,225 --> 00:29:20,060
With what?

595
00:29:20,094 --> 00:29:21,395
You know. Your day.

596
00:29:21,428 --> 00:29:22,463
You look like
you had a hard day,

597
00:29:22,496 --> 00:29:24,164
and we've established
it can't possibly be

598
00:29:24,198 --> 00:29:25,933
about the food.

599
00:29:25,966 --> 00:29:27,268
Just work stuff.

600
00:29:27,301 --> 00:29:29,169
Mm. I get that.

601
00:29:29,203 --> 00:29:31,839
Work can be a pain in the ass.

602
00:29:31,872 --> 00:29:34,041
You have no idea.

603
00:29:34,074 --> 00:29:35,242
Why? What do you do?

604
00:29:35,276 --> 00:29:36,210
It's lame.

605
00:29:36,243 --> 00:29:37,878
Oh my God.

606
00:29:37,911 --> 00:29:39,581
- You just lied to me.
- No I didn't.

607
00:29:39,614 --> 00:29:41,248
We just shared
our first lie,

608
00:29:41,282 --> 00:29:42,883
and it came
from your mouth.

609
00:29:42,916 --> 00:29:44,151
- No!
- Here's the thing about lying.

610
00:29:44,184 --> 00:29:45,986
Lying is something
that I do not mess around with,

611
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,021
me personally.

612
00:29:47,054 --> 00:29:48,355
If this is something
we're gonna continue...

613
00:29:48,389 --> 00:29:49,490
"This"?

614
00:29:49,524 --> 00:29:51,091
Yeah, eating
at the same restaurant.

615
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:52,326
Got it.

616
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:56,063
Then I'm gonna need you to be
completely honest with me.

617
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:58,832
I think I can manage that.

618
00:29:58,866 --> 00:30:00,602
So, Morgan.

619
00:30:00,635 --> 00:30:03,337
- Yes.
- What do you do?

620
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:05,406
I'm an almost-publisher.

621
00:30:05,439 --> 00:30:07,174
- Mm.
- Mm.

622
00:30:07,207 --> 00:30:08,409
So you just loiter
outside of the building

623
00:30:08,442 --> 00:30:09,611
demanding pay?

624
00:30:09,644 --> 00:30:11,546
- Yes.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

625
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:15,182
I didn't mean to, uh,
underestimate your position.

626
00:30:15,215 --> 00:30:19,486
Okay. What kind of books
do you pretend-publish?

627
00:30:19,521 --> 00:30:21,121
Fantasy.

628
00:30:24,425 --> 00:30:25,359
Say that again.

629
00:30:25,392 --> 00:30:26,460
Fantasy.

630
00:30:26,493 --> 00:30:27,995
- No, I heard you the first time.
- Okay.

631
00:30:28,028 --> 00:30:30,164
You were making fun of me
and calling me a loser.

632
00:30:30,197 --> 00:30:31,932
Fantasy can be really cool.

633
00:30:31,965 --> 00:30:33,901
Yeah, if you're
my nine-year-old nephew

634
00:30:33,934 --> 00:30:35,369
and you're in love
with Twilight.

635
00:30:35,402 --> 00:30:36,538
Your nephew likes Twilight?

636
00:30:36,571 --> 00:30:38,005
He loves Twilight.

637
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:40,007
He's not very popular
with the ladies.

638
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,442
Oh. I've got cash.

639
00:30:41,475 --> 00:30:42,510
No, it's fine, I got it.

640
00:30:42,544 --> 00:30:44,345
Put it on the card. Thanks.

641
00:30:44,378 --> 00:30:46,614
You're good, he's gone.

642
00:30:46,648 --> 00:30:48,215
Okay, hm.

643
00:30:48,248 --> 00:30:52,252
What is the best almost-book
you've ever read?

644
00:30:52,286 --> 00:30:55,389
- Really?
- Yeah.

645
00:30:55,422 --> 00:30:57,991
Okay, um...

646
00:30:58,025 --> 00:31:00,427
it's about these two worlds
that exist.

647
00:31:00,461 --> 00:31:02,664
One is well-manicured,
it's for the elite,

648
00:31:02,697 --> 00:31:04,498
and the other one is rural,

649
00:31:04,532 --> 00:31:08,402
- it's incredibly impoverished.
- It's like Elysium.

650
00:31:08,435 --> 00:31:09,504
The Matt Damon movie.

651
00:31:09,537 --> 00:31:11,171
If this is dumb, we really
don't have to do this.

652
00:31:11,205 --> 00:31:13,040
No, keep talking
I'm listening, I'm sorry.

653
00:31:13,073 --> 00:31:14,441
- I'll shut up.
- Yeah? Okay.

654
00:31:14,475 --> 00:31:16,611
So, this child is born
in the second world,

655
00:31:16,644 --> 00:31:19,913
but this mom, she doesn't
want her child to live, like,

656
00:31:19,947 --> 00:31:21,115
through a life of struggles.

657
00:31:21,148 --> 00:31:23,083
So she smuggles the baby
to the first world.

658
00:31:23,117 --> 00:31:24,619
Naturally.

659
00:31:26,554 --> 00:31:27,689
That's it.

660
00:31:27,722 --> 00:31:28,956
That's all you're gonna tell me.

661
00:31:28,989 --> 00:31:30,057
Yes.

662
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:31,559
You're just gonna leave me
on a cliff like that.

663
00:31:31,593 --> 00:31:33,293
Well, you're engaged, right?

664
00:31:33,327 --> 00:31:35,129
This is like
the end of The Sopranos.

665
00:31:35,162 --> 00:31:36,930
- Well, you're not gonna...
- You just cut to bl...

666
00:31:40,968 --> 00:31:43,237
Seem a little tense, kiddo.

667
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:45,707
I'm fine.

668
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,441
Work stuff.

669
00:31:47,474 --> 00:31:48,643
I'm telling you,

670
00:31:48,676 --> 00:31:51,044
you have to check out this forum
that I've been attending.

671
00:31:51,078 --> 00:31:52,246
(Casey chuckles)

672
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:54,047
Don't laugh.

673
00:31:54,081 --> 00:31:57,719
Okay? It's about
choosing your happiness, okay?

674
00:31:57,752 --> 00:31:59,353
Being proactive.

675
00:31:59,386 --> 00:32:01,955
None of this manifesting
or meditation bullshit.

676
00:32:01,989 --> 00:32:03,591
I mean, it's real stuff
that you can use

677
00:32:03,625 --> 00:32:05,727
and make an immediate impact
in your life.

678
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,695
- Immediate?
- Yeah. Well...

679
00:32:07,729 --> 00:32:10,532
it still takes time
and work, you know,

680
00:32:10,565 --> 00:32:12,099
but it's...
it's really incredible.

681
00:32:12,132 --> 00:32:15,235
No, it sounds like
a pyramid scheme.

682
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:16,704
It's not...

683
00:32:16,738 --> 00:32:18,472
- Forget it.
- No, I'm sorry, Dad, I'm sorry,

684
00:32:18,506 --> 00:32:22,176
keep telling me
about your cult.

685
00:32:22,209 --> 00:32:24,311
It's not a cult.

686
00:32:24,344 --> 00:32:25,680
Look, all I'm saying is,

687
00:32:25,713 --> 00:32:27,481
it pushes you to get out there

688
00:32:27,515 --> 00:32:29,717
and make the most
of our time here.

689
00:32:29,751 --> 00:32:31,084
Hm.

690
00:32:31,118 --> 00:32:32,319
Did you know

691
00:32:32,352 --> 00:32:34,689
that the chances of us being
who we are,

692
00:32:34,722 --> 00:32:37,291
alive,
right now at this time,

693
00:32:37,324 --> 00:32:39,426
is one in three trillion?

694
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,328
- Oh wow.
- Yeah. Isn't that amazing?

695
00:32:41,361 --> 00:32:43,497
- Can I get you anything else?
- Yeah, another mimosa, please.

696
00:32:43,531 --> 00:32:45,265
Definitely.

697
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:47,434
- And for you, sir?
- Uh, yeah, um...

698
00:32:47,468 --> 00:32:49,571
I'll just take
some more coffee and, uh...

699
00:32:49,604 --> 00:32:51,539
and the check, please.

700
00:32:51,573 --> 00:32:55,042
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

701
00:32:55,075 --> 00:32:57,110
(Casey sighs)

702
00:32:57,144 --> 00:32:59,246
You can talk to me.

703
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,583
I know. I know!

704
00:33:01,616 --> 00:33:03,183
I know I can.

705
00:33:06,654 --> 00:33:09,022
I love you.

706
00:33:09,056 --> 00:33:11,024
I love you too.

707
00:33:11,058 --> 00:33:12,760
Promise me you'll
check into the forum?

708
00:33:12,794 --> 00:33:14,328
(laughing)

709
00:33:14,361 --> 00:33:17,097
Hey! Thank you,
I got that.

710
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:20,467
Oof. Um, yeah,
got my, uh, cards right here,

711
00:33:20,501 --> 00:33:24,037
packed them, yeah...

712
00:33:24,071 --> 00:33:25,205
Wait a second.

713
00:33:25,239 --> 00:33:26,774
Coulda sworn
I put them right here.

714
00:33:26,808 --> 00:33:29,209
I woke up this morning,
I put it in my... yes, I know,

715
00:33:29,243 --> 00:33:32,446
they've gotta be here,
I know they're here.

716
00:33:32,479 --> 00:33:34,682
Dammit.

717
00:33:34,716 --> 00:33:36,483
I put it here,
I know I put it here today,

718
00:33:36,518 --> 00:33:37,619
- I put it right here.
- You know, Dad, totally fine.

719
00:33:37,652 --> 00:33:38,786
- I got it.
- No, no, no, no, no.

720
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:39,621
- Don't even worry about it.

- Nooo! No, no, no, no!

905
00:40:56,791 --> 00:41:00,194
- I told you I'd win.
- No! Oh, I can't breathe.

906
00:41:00,227 --> 00:41:01,095
Oh, that is rich.

907
00:41:01,128 --> 00:41:02,563
- Hold still.
- No, no.

908
00:41:02,596 --> 00:41:04,098
Okay, good. Hold still,
hold still, hold still.

909
00:41:04,131 --> 00:41:05,933
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

910
00:41:05,967 --> 00:41:07,735
- No, no!
- That's good, that's perfect.

911
00:41:07,768 --> 00:41:09,570
Oh, look, look!

912
00:41:09,603 --> 00:41:11,939
- Oh, the face of defeat...
- Help me!

913
00:41:11,973 --> 00:41:13,040
...is rich!

914
00:41:16,644 --> 00:41:19,513
It is like that homeless man
bent over and released

915
00:41:19,547 --> 00:41:22,283
an inhuman amount
of explosive diarrhea,

916
00:41:22,316 --> 00:41:24,719
and then decided to just do,
like,

917
00:41:24,752 --> 00:41:27,221
a 360 while he was at it.

918
00:41:27,254 --> 00:41:29,757
Wow. Is that what you say
to all the ladies?

919
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:30,992
Just you.

920
00:41:31,025 --> 00:41:32,026
Touched.

921
00:41:32,059 --> 00:41:34,195
Hey, do you think
the ceiling fan in the back

922
00:41:34,228 --> 00:41:35,997
is high enough for me
to hang a noose from?

923
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:38,065
Come on,
don't sound so bleak.

924
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:40,768
You've got those Dave & Buster's
bucks to look forward to,

925
00:41:40,801 --> 00:41:41,969
you can't forget that,

926
00:41:42,003 --> 00:41:43,571
it's important information.

927
00:41:43,604 --> 00:41:44,605
All right, I'm just
gonna come out and say it,

928
00:41:44,638 --> 00:41:46,140
'cause I know everyone else
is thinking it.

929
00:41:46,173 --> 00:41:47,908
You're gay?

930
00:41:47,942 --> 00:41:48,976
I wish.

931
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:50,611
My romantic life would be
a lot less depressing

932
00:41:50,644 --> 00:41:51,779
if that was the case.

933
00:41:51,812 --> 00:41:53,848
Well, word on the street is
you've given a blow job,

934
00:41:53,881 --> 00:41:55,816
so I'm sure if you enjoyed that,

935
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:58,219
you will be
pleasantly surprised by it.

936
00:41:58,252 --> 00:41:59,687
Okay, first of all,

937
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,655
I was on the receiving end
of that blow job,

938
00:42:01,689 --> 00:42:03,290
and that was
a onetime experiment,

939
00:42:03,324 --> 00:42:04,892
it doesn't make me gay.

940
00:42:04,925 --> 00:42:06,327
It's not...

941
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,828
It definitely brings
your level of straight

942
00:42:07,862 --> 00:42:08,729
into question.

943
00:42:08,763 --> 00:42:09,663
Like you're so pure,

944
00:42:09,697 --> 00:42:12,833
Miss "It's easier
to go down on a girl

945
00:42:12,867 --> 00:42:15,036
than it is to suck a dick."

946
00:42:16,237 --> 00:42:18,806
Yeah. It is.
It absolutely is.

947
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:20,574
And that was
a threesome situation,

948
00:42:20,608 --> 00:42:23,110
not one-on-one,
so totally different scenario.

949
00:42:23,144 --> 00:42:24,211
You know what?

950
00:42:24,245 --> 00:42:26,247
Those certificates are going
straight to Grace Kim,

951
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,214
by the way.

952
00:42:27,248 --> 00:42:29,316
Who, by pure chance
being of Asian descent

953
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:33,187
has the natural ability
to just beat all of us,

954
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,088
because she's Asian.

955
00:42:34,121 --> 00:42:35,890
Yeah, I don't think
the ceiling fan

956
00:42:35,923 --> 00:42:38,059
will sustain your weight,
but...

957
00:42:38,092 --> 00:42:40,194
you could try the exposed pipe
in the walk-in freezer.

958
00:42:40,227 --> 00:42:41,796
Just a thought.

959
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:44,365
I love my life.

960
00:42:44,398 --> 00:42:46,634
Well, it could be worse.

961
00:42:46,667 --> 00:42:48,302
You could be Laurel.

962
00:42:48,335 --> 00:42:50,004
I never thought about that.

963
00:42:50,037 --> 00:42:52,006
- That's really dark.
- That's super dark.

964
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:53,741
That's also funny!

965
00:42:53,774 --> 00:42:56,177
I'm telling you, you got
this dark humor thing down.

966
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:57,645
You should really
capitalize on it,

967
00:42:57,678 --> 00:42:58,913
do some stand-up.

968
00:42:58,946 --> 00:43:01,082
In fact, there's this
really cool open mic

969
00:43:01,115 --> 00:43:02,950
- Thursday...
- No!

970
00:43:02,983 --> 00:43:03,784
What can I do?

971
00:43:03,818 --> 00:43:05,252
What can I do
to change your mind?

972
00:43:05,286 --> 00:43:06,821
(blows sustained raspberry)

973
00:43:06,854 --> 00:43:09,023
Not suck dick, yeah.

974
00:43:09,056 --> 00:43:11,225
I told you,
I was on the receiving end.

975
00:43:11,258 --> 00:43:14,061
Oh my God, I forgot, yeah, and
also not get your dick sucked

976
00:43:14,095 --> 00:43:15,162
by other dudes.

977
00:43:15,196 --> 00:43:17,398
See? Now you're just
setting me up for failure.

978
00:43:17,431 --> 00:43:18,567
Why do you do that?

979
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:20,835
Oh no, you are doing that
all on your own, I promise.

980
00:43:20,868 --> 00:43:23,804
So if I hadn't let Martin
have his way with me,

981
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:25,072
then you'd let me date you?

982
00:43:25,106 --> 00:43:26,640
Honestly?

983
00:43:26,674 --> 00:43:28,275
I don't even care
that you like dudes, whatever.

984
00:43:28,309 --> 00:43:32,279
It's your... general existence
that repels me,

985
00:43:32,313 --> 00:43:33,948
it's just like, ugh.

986
00:43:33,981 --> 00:43:36,183
Wow. Okay, you know what?

987
00:43:36,217 --> 00:43:37,418
I don't even like you anymore.

988
00:43:37,451 --> 00:43:38,986
All right? There. I said it.

989
00:43:39,019 --> 00:43:40,187
I've been over you for a while.

990
00:43:40,221 --> 00:43:41,288
And you know what?

991
00:43:41,322 --> 00:43:44,225
Martin loves me
for who I am,

992
00:43:44,258 --> 00:43:47,728
so fuck you.

993
00:43:47,761 --> 00:43:49,063
Where are you going?

994
00:43:49,096 --> 00:43:52,867
I'm going to hang myself
from the freezer.

995
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:53,968
Unless you'd miss me.

996
00:43:54,001 --> 00:43:56,170
Oh no, you go ahead,
you have fun.

997
00:43:56,203 --> 00:43:58,105
Bye!

998
00:43:58,939 --> 00:44:01,342
Okay.

999
00:44:01,375 --> 00:44:05,012
Have I got something
special for you.

1000
00:44:07,248 --> 00:44:09,016
So what is it?

1001
00:44:09,049 --> 00:44:11,752
Some red wine.

1002
00:44:11,785 --> 00:44:13,420
- Tell me. Tell me.
- It's a good cab,

1003
00:44:13,454 --> 00:44:16,056
cab sauvignon, somethin'.

1004
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:18,025
It's Trader Joe's house wine.

1005
00:44:18,058 --> 00:44:19,693
That's, like, six bucks.

1006
00:44:19,727 --> 00:44:21,996
Four. Got it on clearance.

1007
00:44:22,029 --> 00:44:23,097
Well, then,
I hope it has mold

1008
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:25,399
and you go into
anaphylactic shock.

1009
00:44:25,432 --> 00:44:28,836
That could very potentially lead
to both of our deaths.

1010
00:44:28,869 --> 00:44:30,771
I welcome death.

1011
00:44:30,804 --> 00:44:33,307
Hm. Cheers.

1012
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:34,375
(glasses clink)

1013
00:44:34,408 --> 00:44:35,309
To our mass suicide.

1014
00:44:35,342 --> 00:44:36,911
Okay.

1015
00:44:40,515 --> 00:44:42,483
Oh, it's terrible!

1016
00:44:42,517 --> 00:44:45,119
I am so sorry.

1017
00:44:45,152 --> 00:44:46,253
That's all right.

1018
00:44:46,287 --> 00:44:47,755
I don't think so,
I think it's the worst thing

1019
00:44:47,788 --> 00:44:50,090
that's ever been
inside my mouth.

1020
00:44:50,124 --> 00:44:52,826
There's been some weird shit
in my mouth.

1021
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:54,261
But that is bad.

1022
00:44:54,295 --> 00:44:56,797
Uggh!

1023
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:58,399
Okay.

1024
00:44:58,432 --> 00:44:59,833
You ready?

1025
00:44:59,867 --> 00:45:01,735
For what?

1026
00:45:04,972 --> 00:45:05,906
What?

1027
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:06,974
- Talk.
- No.

1028
00:45:07,007 --> 00:45:08,042
- Yeah.
- No, we really don't

1029
00:45:08,075 --> 00:45:08,976
have to do this.

1030
00:45:09,009 --> 00:45:09,877
Oh, we really do,
because if I had lost,

1031
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:11,779
you'da made me
paint my fingernails,

1032
00:45:11,812 --> 00:45:13,814
so you're...
you're gonna talk.

1033
00:45:13,847 --> 00:45:14,715
But whatever
I'm gonna come up with

1034
00:45:14,748 --> 00:45:17,351
is gonna be lame
and depressing so, no.

1035
00:45:17,384 --> 00:45:18,485
I love lame and depressing,

1036
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:19,954
that's why I asked you out.

1037
00:45:19,987 --> 00:45:21,355
Fuck you.

1038
00:45:21,388 --> 00:45:23,757
Fine. Okay.

1039
00:45:23,791 --> 00:45:28,762
I haven't talked
with my parents in 10 years.

1040
00:45:31,265 --> 00:45:33,901
- Okay.
- That's it.

1041
00:45:33,934 --> 00:45:36,337
You have any cheese
that can go with this?

1042
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:37,539
You're not gonna
get away with that.

1043
00:45:37,572 --> 00:45:39,340
If I drink
on an empty stomach,

1044
00:45:39,373 --> 00:45:41,475
things tend to get
a little slutty.

1045
00:45:41,509 --> 00:45:42,376
And I like you,

1046
00:45:42,409 --> 00:45:46,347
so I wanna just
stay a little classy.

1047
00:45:48,449 --> 00:45:50,851
You said you like me!

1048
00:45:50,884 --> 00:45:52,486
Oh.

1049
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,188
(rolls tongue)

1050
00:45:54,221 --> 00:45:55,923
- Did you like that?
- Don't ever do that ever again.

1051
00:45:55,956 --> 00:45:57,391
- No?
- Could you maybe, like,

1052
00:45:57,424 --> 00:45:58,993
talk a little low, maybe that?

1053
00:45:59,026 --> 00:46:01,095
- Like Vin Diesel?
- Yes.

1054
00:46:01,128 --> 00:46:02,429
(in exaggeratedly low voice)
Family.

1055
00:46:02,463 --> 00:46:03,430
(Morgan laughs)

1056
00:46:03,464 --> 00:46:06,200
I can't really
lower my voice that much, but...

1057
00:46:06,233 --> 00:46:08,869
- family.
- Oh!

1058
00:46:08,902 --> 00:46:10,471
- Fantastic.
- Fine!

1059
00:46:10,505 --> 00:46:11,905
- What?
- If I get you cheese,

1060
00:46:11,939 --> 00:46:13,340
will you please finish?

1061
00:46:13,374 --> 00:46:15,442
Fuck, fuck, fuck,
get the cheese!

1062
00:46:15,476 --> 00:46:16,977
Yes!

1063
00:46:23,284 --> 00:46:25,853
Uggh!

1064
00:46:25,886 --> 00:46:28,222
(wine sloshing)

1065
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:32,059
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1066
00:46:32,092 --> 00:46:35,429
Okay. Cheese, knife, crackers.

1067
00:46:35,462 --> 00:46:38,065
- Are you serious?
- I'm very serious.

1068
00:46:38,098 --> 00:46:39,800
Blue cheese?

1069
00:46:41,368 --> 00:46:43,270
What else do you want from me?

1070
00:46:43,304 --> 00:46:48,008
Who hurt you as a child
that you put out blue cheese?

1071
00:46:54,081 --> 00:46:56,584
- I like you.
- Aww!

1072
00:46:56,618 --> 00:46:57,985
A little bit.

1073
00:47:00,655 --> 00:47:02,557
No matter what you tell me,

1074
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:05,359
that's not gonna change.

1075
00:47:05,392 --> 00:47:07,194
I promise.

1076
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:21,975
Okay.

1077
00:47:25,112 --> 00:47:28,248
Um...

1078
00:47:28,282 --> 00:47:30,652
My dad,

1079
00:47:30,685 --> 00:47:32,152
he used to drink.

1080
00:47:32,186 --> 00:47:33,555
And one night,

1081
00:47:33,588 --> 00:47:35,623
we were watching TV
in the living room,

1082
00:47:35,657 --> 00:47:41,028
my mom had fallen asleep putting
my little brother to bed.

1083
00:47:41,061 --> 00:47:43,130
My head was in my dad's lap.

1084
00:47:43,163 --> 00:47:45,499
He was stroking my hair.

1085
00:47:45,533 --> 00:47:50,605
And, um, then I felt
this hand go up my shirt.

1086
00:47:52,439 --> 00:47:56,243
First, I didn't know
what to do,

1087
00:47:56,276 --> 00:47:59,012
but eventually,
I snapped up,

1088
00:47:59,046 --> 00:48:00,682
walked back to my room,

1089
00:48:00,715 --> 00:48:06,120
and I slept with the desk chair
pushed against the doorknob.

1090
00:48:08,222 --> 00:48:09,189
And the next day,

1091
00:48:09,223 --> 00:48:13,127
he pretended like
nothing had ever happened.

1092
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,429
So at first I thought
maybe he didn't remember

1093
00:48:15,462 --> 00:48:20,702
or maybe I was
remembering it wrong, but...

1094
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:24,471
every time we would be alone
in a room together,

1095
00:48:24,506 --> 00:48:27,374
he would look at me
like he remembered.

1096
00:48:27,408 --> 00:48:31,111
Sure enough, another night,
I woke up, and...

1097
00:48:37,652 --> 00:48:40,487
Well, anyways,

1098
00:48:40,522 --> 00:48:44,458
I ended up telling my mom
couple months later.

1099
00:48:44,491 --> 00:48:47,428
She freaked out,

1100
00:48:47,461 --> 00:48:48,696
and my dad said
that he was hurt

1101
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:49,930
that I would say
something like that,

1102
00:48:49,963 --> 00:48:53,267
that he would never hurt me
in a million years, that I...

1103
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:56,604
that I was his little girl.

1104
00:49:00,107 --> 00:49:03,143
But my mom threw me
out of the house,

1105
00:49:03,177 --> 00:49:08,282
and I haven't seen either them
or my little brother since.

1106
00:49:14,221 --> 00:49:17,424
I'm so sorry.

1107
00:49:17,458 --> 00:49:20,562

make you talk about something

the Lifetime Movie Network

Suspension of disbelief.

01:10:05,740 --> 01:10:07,508
Dude, now I'm in
on a Friday night.

1618
01:10:07,542 --> 01:10:08,810
Just when I was
starting to feel

1619
01:10:08,843 --> 01:10:10,343
a little bit better
about myself.

1620
01:10:10,377 --> 01:10:11,813
Hey, you're not watching alone.

So what we're not getting
shit-faced on a Friday night.

We're bonding!

We are watching a TV movie

as intellectual conversation.

- Anything.

I just feel like
the right side of mine

1645
01:11:10,605 --> 01:11:12,039
is just a little bit longer.

1646
01:11:12,073 --> 01:11:13,908
- The inside or the outside?
- Inside.

1647
01:11:13,941 --> 01:11:16,577
It's not hugely noticeable,
it's just...

1648
01:11:16,611 --> 01:11:19,046
It just feels like
it's just a little bit longer.

No, but I just want to know
what his excuse is.

I don't know.

You were embarrassed?

fucks for money.

are there... are there any kids

1758
01:15:59,627 --> 01:16:01,896

01:16:01,929 --> 01:16:04,265
No?

01:16:04,298 --> 01:16:06,600
Okay, well, that's good,
no kids.

1761
01:16:06,634 --> 01:16:08,135
Um...

1762
01:16:08,169 --> 01:16:09,637
Do you run a drug cartel?

1763
01:16:09,670 --> 01:16:10,905

God, Morgan, you...

1765
01:16:12,273 --> 01:16:14,108
you lied to me.

1766
01:16:14,141 --> 01:16:16,944
I didn't lie.

1767
01:16:16,977 --> 01:16:19,814
Come on.

01:16:29,957 --> 01:16:34,662

Lowick, it's three
in the morning.

I know it's three
in the morning,

1771

but I don't think
it's a good idea

1772
01:16:39,133 --> 01:16:41,402
that we be in the same room
right now.

1773

1782
01:17:17,771 --> 01:17:20,407
even though gluten-free doesn't
really constitute as pizza,

1783
01:17:20,441 --> 01:17:22,443
but, you know, I got it anyways

back when you were
a super bitchy barista.

2321
01:40:11,278 --> 01:40:15,517
And I definitely won't think
of you when I jack off anymore."

2322
01:40:15,550 --> 01:40:17,519
- That's so cute!
- That's disgusting.

2323
01:40:17,552 --> 01:40:18,520
I think it's funny.

2324
01:40:18,553 --> 01:40:19,386
- It is.
- Thank you.

2325
01:40:19,419 --> 01:40:23,090
"Best of luck
in this shitty world.

2326
01:40:23,123 --> 01:40:25,058
Kyle."

2327
01:40:25,092 --> 01:40:26,628
(laughing)

2328
01:40:26,661 --> 01:40:29,831
"In case you ever... lover..."

2329
01:40:29,864 --> 01:40:31,298
- Lower.
- "Lower."

2330
01:40:31,331 --> 01:40:33,467
- Lower.
- His handwriting is very shitty.

2331
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:36,436
"...your standards,
you know where to find me.

2332
01:40:36,470 --> 01:40:38,171
Let's fuck each other up."

2333
01:40:38,205 --> 01:40:39,807
Oh my God, I love him.

2334
01:40:39,841 --> 01:40:41,408
- Really?
- Yeah.

2335
01:40:41,441 --> 01:40:42,744
He's a weirdo.

2336
01:40:42,777 --> 01:40:44,612
Wait, you're not actually
gonna call him.

2337
01:40:44,646 --> 01:40:46,848
He is so greasy, Sage.

2338
01:40:46,881 --> 01:40:48,716
Of course she's gonna call him.

2339
01:40:48,750 --> 01:40:50,685
Weirdos do all
the fun, kinky shit.

2340
01:40:50,718 --> 01:40:51,686
(laughing)

2341
01:40:51,719 --> 01:40:53,320
Do you think his cum is greasy?

2342
01:40:53,353 --> 01:40:55,523
Okay, I am not...
not at that level yet.

2343
01:40:55,557 --> 01:40:57,257
Grease jizz!

2344
01:40:57,291 --> 01:40:58,726
Yes!

2345
01:40:58,760 --> 01:41:00,327
New addition to the team.

2346
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:01,461
He's not greasy!

2347
01:41:01,495 --> 01:41:04,866
Why do you guys always have
to circle back to jizz?

2348
01:41:04,899 --> 01:41:07,434
- Why not? Why should we not?
- Anything else.

2349
01:41:07,467 --> 01:41:09,202
- Why is she shushing us?
- I don't know.

2350
01:41:09,236 --> 01:41:10,838
- You're judging me.
- Is Kyle, like, outside?

2351
01:41:10,872 --> 01:41:14,308
- Of course I'm judging you.
- Shut up, shut up, shut up.

2352
01:41:14,341 --> 01:41:15,577
(screaming)

2353
01:41:15,610 --> 01:41:21,348
I don't want your jizz
grease breath on me!

2354
01:41:21,381 --> 01:41:23,685
Ew, why am I talking
about jizz now?

2355
01:41:23,718 --> 01:41:26,721
- You guys have changed me.
- You're corrupted!

2356
01:41:26,754 --> 01:41:28,255
I'm sorry, honey.

2357
01:41:28,288 --> 01:41:32,426
(screaming, laughing)

2358
01:41:32,459 --> 01:41:34,494
You scared the shit out...

2359
01:41:34,529 --> 01:41:36,229
You bitch!

2360
01:41:36,263 --> 01:41:37,865
(laughing)

2361
01:41:37,899 --> 01:41:39,499
Got 'em.

2362
01:41:39,534 --> 01:41:41,569
Yeah, you did.

2363
01:41:41,603 --> 01:41:44,171
When was the last time
you shaved your legs?

2364
01:41:44,204 --> 01:41:45,472
Give me your hand.

2365
01:41:45,505 --> 01:41:48,175
(laughing)

2366
01:41:48,208 --> 01:41:52,312
I like Kyle now, he loves
our girl for who she is.

2367
01:41:52,346 --> 01:41:54,281
Even with hairy legs.

2368
01:41:54,314 --> 01:41:55,883
(laughing)

2369
01:41:55,917 --> 01:41:58,620
I'm leaving you, I'm going pee.
I'm done with you guys.

2370
01:41:58,653 --> 01:42:00,454
- Go pee.
- Okay, bye.

2371
01:42:00,487 --> 01:42:03,357
- Yeah, I'm leaving.
- Love you, mean it.

2372
01:42:03,390 --> 01:42:05,492
I hope you enjoy
your life without me,

2373
01:42:05,526 --> 01:42:07,394
'cause it's gonna be
a long one.

2374
01:42:07,427 --> 01:42:09,429
- Sagey.
- A very long life.

2375
01:42:09,463 --> 01:42:10,898
Okay, wait, don't leave us.

2376
01:42:10,932 --> 01:42:12,767
We're a lesbian tribe!

2377
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:14,636
(laughing)

2378
01:42:14,669 --> 01:42:17,772
- It's too late, I'm gone.
- Okay, bye then.

2379
01:42:17,805 --> 01:42:19,339
I'm dead and I'm dying.

2380
01:42:19,373 --> 01:42:21,274
We'll survive without you.

2381
01:42:21,308 --> 01:42:23,711
- No, we won't, actually.
- No?
