20

<i>But the food was
sensational, right? I mean...</i>

21
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,267
<i>But you didn't even call it

22

<i>You know, it's funny</i>

27
00:01:01,678 --> 00:01:03,878
<i>because a lot of</i>
<i>the comedians that</i>
<i>I've interviewed,</i>

28
00:01:03,947 --> 00:01:05,947
<i>their humor
centers around food,</i>

<i>around the family
dining room table.</i>

30
00:01:07,751 --> 00:01:09,116
<i>Well, yeah, sure.
That's because</i>

31
00:01:09,185 --> 00:01:10,952
<i>most of their families
came from Russia,</i>

32
00:01:11,021 --> 00:01:12,687
<i>see? And in Russia,
they had no food.</i>

33
00:01:12,756 --> 00:01:14,756
<i>I mean, sand
was a beverage.</i>

34
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:16,090
<i>I mean, like,
in my family,</i>

35
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,826
<i>my uncle schmuclich,
when he came here</i>

36
00:01:18,895 --> 00:01:20,728
<i>and saw a supermarket
for the first time,</i>

37
00:01:20,797 --> 00:01:22,437
<i>he proposed to a brisket.</i>

38
00:01:22,498 --> 00:01:24,298
<i>Well, there was
talk he had to.</i>

39
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:26,534
<i>See, but for me, my
family was like, uh,</i>

40
00:01:26,603 --> 00:01:27,936
dances with Jews.

41
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:29,037
<i>Oh, sure,</i>

42
00:01:29,105 --> 00:01:30,305
<i>we had names
for our relatives,</i>

43
00:01:30,373 --> 00:01:31,673
<i>like they had
in that movie.</i>

44
00:01:31,741 --> 00:01:32,974
<i>What do you mean?</i>

45
00:01:33,043 --> 00:01:34,208
<i>Well, we had "eats
with his hands,"</i>

46
00:01:34,277 --> 00:01:35,409
<i>"spits
when he talks,"</i>

47
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:36,911
<i>"makes noise

48
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,412

00:01:46,389 --> 00:01:47,655
<i>Let me give you
a fashion tip.</i>

56
00:01:47,724 --> 00:01:49,190
<i>The pants go
on the bottom.</i>

57
00:01:49,258 --> 00:01:50,925
<i>Where's my drummer?
Ba dum-da.</i>

58
00:01:50,994 --> 00:01:53,695
<i>Now, so... so you got your
humor from the family?</i>

59
00:01:53,763 --> 00:01:56,097
<i>Oh, yeah. My father had
a great sense of humor.</i>

60
00:01:56,165 --> 00:01:57,531
<i>He died when
we were kids.</i>

61
00:01:57,601 --> 00:01:59,634
<i>He was always
doin' stuff like that.</i>

62
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,069
<i>What a kidder.</i>

63
00:02:01,137 --> 00:02:03,004
<i>No, no, no. Who was
your biggest influence?</i>

64
00:02:03,073 --> 00:02:04,639
<i>All of them.
The entire herd.</i>

65
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:05,974
<i>They were
a joyous people.</i>

66
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,241
<i>See, they
spoke yiddish,</i>

67
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,077
<i>which is a language of
coughing and spitting.</i>

68
00:02:09,145 --> 00:02:11,646
<i>So until I was 15,

00:05:21,537 --> 00:05:22,837
Thank you.

178
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:23,838
Hurt them.

179
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,406
La, la, la, la, la, la.

180
00:05:25,475 --> 00:05:26,941
Get outta here.

<i>What's the matter,
buddy? Having a bad day?</i>

185
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:06,547
A bad day?

186
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,550
Don't get me started!

187
00:06:15,558 --> 00:06:18,426
Ah, don't get me started
on today, I'll tell you this.

188
00:06:18,494 --> 00:06:20,295
Actually, it started
last night, folks.

189
00:06:20,363 --> 00:06:22,130
I had a little fight
with my wife.

190
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,498
Nothing serious.
3 police cars.

191
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,069
Mommy,
is this true?

192
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:30,138
No, honey.
It's just a joke.

193
00:06:30,207 --> 00:06:31,973
Ok.

194
00:06:32,042 --> 00:06:34,008
I'm gonna tell you folks
what really happened

195
00:06:34,077 --> 00:06:35,776
because we're
friends now.

196
00:06:36,947 --> 00:06:38,579
Last night,
i come home,

197
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,348
I found my wife
smooching and kissing

198
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,016
with my best friend.

199
00:06:42,085 --> 00:06:43,251
Ooh!

200
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,752
Yeah. So I said,
"Lenny, I have to.

201
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:45,854
"But you?"

202
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,656
Mommy,
is this true?

203
00:06:48,725 --> 00:06:50,358
No. It's just
a joke, honey.

204
00:06:50,426 --> 00:06:51,860
Ok.

205
00:06:55,098 --> 00:06:57,031
And my daughter's
no genius, either.

206
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,400
<i>Oh, don't get me
started on her.</i>

207
00:07:00,536 --> 00:07:01,936
It's just a
joke, honey.

208
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,437
It's just a joke.

209
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:04,739
<i>Yeah, she's 6.</i>

210
00:07:04,807 --> 00:07:06,707
<i>She'll be 7
if I let her.</i>

211
00:07:06,776 --> 00:07:08,343
<i>Every morning
when she gets up,</i>

212
00:07:08,411 --> 00:07:09,911
<i>"daddy, I got
a headache."</i>

00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,379
<i>It drives me crazy.</i>

214
00:07:11,447 --> 00:07:12,780
<i>"Daddy, I got
a headache."</i>

215
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,416
<i>So I said, "look,
when you get out of bed,</i>

216
00:07:15,485 --> 00:07:17,085
"it's feet first."

217
00:07:19,555 --> 00:07:21,689
See, then the show
just went on from there.

218
00:07:21,758 --> 00:07:23,291
You know, that
was a great night.

219
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,093
That was in 19...
Ba-ba-ba-boom.

220
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:26,560
I'll tell you
that right now.

221
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:27,828
No, that was
the night

222
00:07:27,898 --> 00:07:29,931
that the network called
me "Mr. Saturday night."

223
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,732
Yeah, and you were
on for how long?

224
00:07:31,801 --> 00:07:33,467
An hour. And
then <i>gunsmoke...</i>

225
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,236
Now, how do you
like t.V. Today?

226
00:07:35,305 --> 00:07:38,139
Terrible. Because my
reception is so bad...

227
00:07:39,575 --> 00:07:41,575
I had that cable guy
with the belt cleavage

228
00:07:41,644 --> 00:07:43,411
come over and
give me a snowstorm

229
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:45,813
on every channel.

230
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,081
10 minutes, buddy.

231
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,682
Ok, good.

232
00:07:48,751 --> 00:07:50,551
Oh, i-I'm sorry, i
should get out of here.

233
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,460
You've got a show to do.
Ok.

234
00:07:52,522 --> 00:07:53,922
Ok. Nice
meeting you.

235
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,189
Pleasure
to meet you.

236
00:07:55,258 --> 00:07:56,424
Ok.
Ok. Bye-bye.

237
00:07:56,492 --> 00:07:57,926
Remember,
feet first.

238
00:07:57,994 --> 00:07:59,160
Ok.

239
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,328
How's the crowd?

240
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:01,296
Comin' in.

241
00:08:01,364 --> 00:08:02,530
Great.

242
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,406
Jesus Christ, Stan.

243
00:08:11,474 --> 00:08:13,541
What is this, a
civil war reunion?

244
00:08:13,609 --> 00:08:14,809
They're a
little older.

245
00:08:14,877 --> 00:08:16,177
A little older?

246
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:17,912
These people built
the pyramids.

247
00:08:17,981 --> 00:08:19,480
You said there'd
be singles.

248
00:08:19,549 --> 00:08:21,082
A lot of them
are single.

249
00:08:21,151 --> 00:08:23,884
Yeah, because whoever
they were with is dead.

250
00:08:23,954 --> 00:08:26,087
What are you complainin'?
It's jammed up.

251
00:08:26,156 --> 00:08:28,456
Yeah? So's my ass.

252
00:08:28,524 --> 00:08:30,158
You booked me
into a condominium,

253
00:08:30,226 --> 00:08:31,306
for Christ's sake.

254
00:08:31,361 --> 00:08:32,760
Gotta be wearin'
a tuxedo

255
00:08:32,829 --> 00:08:34,929
at 1:00 in the
goddamn afternoon.

256
00:08:34,998 --> 00:08:36,931
Comedy's a nighttime
thing, Stan.

257
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,967
You can't be funny
Durin' the day.

258
00:08:39,035 --> 00:08:41,302
There are no dayclubs,
there are nightclubs.

259
00:08:41,371 --> 00:08:42,870
They're not funny
on <i>the today show,</i>

260
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,339
they're funny
on <i>the tonight show.</i>

261
00:08:44,407 --> 00:08:45,974
So work slowly.
It'll be nighttime.

262
00:08:46,042 --> 00:08:47,202
Buddy, you do
the bakery bit.

263
00:08:47,243 --> 00:08:48,843
They'll pee
in their pants.

264
00:08:48,911 --> 00:08:50,979
They're doin' that anyway.
What the hell do they need me for?

265
00:08:51,047 --> 00:08:52,480
Now, listen
to me, buddy,

266
00:08:52,548 --> 00:08:54,482
don't... don't get
nasty out there.

267
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,984
All right?
Not this time.

268
00:08:56,052 --> 00:08:57,986
These are... these are
nice old people.

269
00:08:58,054 --> 00:08:59,920
Stan, I'm shocked.

270
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,489
Do you think that
i would honestly

271
00:09:01,557 --> 00:09:03,124
go out there, huh,

272
00:09:03,193 --> 00:09:05,226
and... and insult
these people, huh?

273
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:06,494
Do you honestly think

274
00:09:06,562 --> 00:09:08,062
that I would walk
out there and say,

275
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,730
"good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,

276
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,200
"so what's it like
to outlive your kids?"

277
00:09:12,268 --> 00:09:13,901
I wouldn't
say that, Stan.

278
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,836
I wouldn't say,
"excuse me, ma'am,

279
00:09:15,905 --> 00:09:18,373
"Moses called. He said
you're a great fuck."

280
00:09:18,441 --> 00:09:19,940
Come on, Stan,
i wouldn't say that.

281
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,442
I wouldn't
do that to you.

282
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:23,444
You gotta have a little
faith in people.

283
00:09:23,513 --> 00:09:24,845
Ok. I was
just checkin'.

284
00:09:24,914 --> 00:09:26,280
Yeah. Good.

285
00:09:31,687 --> 00:09:32,887
Thanks.

286
00:09:38,094 --> 00:09:40,428
Stan, would you get me
my soda, please?

287
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:41,562
Uh-huh.

288
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,431
And, uh, you know,
leave me alone

289
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,533
for, uh, the rest
of your life?

290
00:09:46,802 --> 00:09:48,069
I'm just kidding.

291
00:09:49,739 --> 00:09:51,272
Did you see
what I did there?

292
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,407
Yeah.

293
00:09:52,475 --> 00:09:53,475
Put on this jacket.

294
00:09:53,543 --> 00:09:54,808
Yeah?
Yeah.

295
00:09:54,877 --> 00:09:56,911
Hey, Stan, you ok?

296
00:09:56,979 --> 00:09:58,346
Yeah. Sure.

297
00:09:59,582 --> 00:10:00,515
Hurt them.

298
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,550
La, la, la, la.

299
00:10:21,104 --> 00:10:23,171
<i>Guys, how many of you
still have your prostates?</i>

300
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:24,605
<i>How many?</i>

301
00:10:24,674 --> 00:10:26,006
<i>Not you, lady.</i>

302
00:10:26,076 --> 00:10:27,108
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

303
00:10:27,177 --> 00:10:28,376
<i>Nah. I'm just kiddin'.</i>

304
00:10:28,445 --> 00:10:29,610
<i>You're a good sport.</i>

305
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:31,412
<i>By the way,
Moses called...</i>

306
00:10:37,287 --> 00:10:38,819
That big fat woman
in the front,

307
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,121
that big tub there

308
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,956
that looked like she
had her own climate...

309
00:10:42,024 --> 00:10:43,257
Buddy, enough
already, ok?

310
00:10:43,326 --> 00:10:45,326
Couldn't get her to laugh,
couldn't budge her,

311
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:46,760
couldn't even
get her to smile.

312
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:48,262
She had had
a stroke.

313
00:10:48,331 --> 00:10:50,331
Then what is she
doing in the front?

314
00:10:50,366 --> 00:10:51,926
Don't come out.
Stay home.

315
00:10:51,968 --> 00:10:53,134
Have a sponge bath.

316
00:10:53,203 --> 00:10:54,502
Have somebody
read to you.

317
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,104
But no, I get
tubs 'r' us.

318
00:10:56,172 --> 00:10:58,172
How did she get in
the front row, anyway?

319
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:00,074
Are you screwin' her?

320
00:11:01,478 --> 00:11:02,910
Come on, let's get
somethin' to eat,

321
00:11:02,979 --> 00:11:04,178
for Christ's sake.

322
00:11:11,287 --> 00:11:12,520
Oh, boy.

323
00:11:13,223 --> 00:11:14,223
Oh.

324
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,591
I ate too much.

325
00:11:16,659 --> 00:11:19,127
I'm gonna go home
and shit a waiter.

326
00:11:21,164 --> 00:11:22,663
"Shit a waiter."

327
00:11:26,736 --> 00:11:28,469
So, how long
have you been working

328
00:11:28,538 --> 00:11:30,804
on this Marcel marceau
imitation? It's very good.

329
00:11:30,873 --> 00:11:33,107
Come on, what's
with you today?

330
00:11:34,544 --> 00:11:36,076
Buddy, I, uh...

331
00:11:36,146 --> 00:11:37,645
I got some bad news.

332
00:11:37,713 --> 00:11:38,779
What is it? Mom?

333
00:11:38,848 --> 00:11:40,248
No. She's the same.

334
00:11:40,316 --> 00:11:41,915
Oh, Susan then.
She's in trouble again?

335
00:11:41,984 --> 00:11:43,417
No, no.
You know, that kid...

336
00:11:43,486 --> 00:11:45,219
We lost the cruise.

337
00:11:46,256 --> 00:11:48,156
The ship,
the whole thing?

338
00:11:48,224 --> 00:11:49,323
That was my winter.

339
00:11:49,392 --> 00:11:50,832
It was
2 months' booking.

340
00:11:50,893 --> 00:11:52,760
I know. I... I... I didn't
wanna tell you

341
00:11:52,828 --> 00:11:54,562
before you had
to do a show.

342
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,597
What happened?

343
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,899
Well, they told me
they've been getting

344
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,834
a lot of younger
people, and...

345
00:12:00,903 --> 00:12:03,237
They wanted a
younger comedian.

346
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:04,605
Boy, oh, boy.

347
00:12:04,674 --> 00:12:06,274
Huh?

348
00:12:06,342 --> 00:12:08,342
That was my winter.

349
00:12:08,411 --> 00:12:10,478
That was my nuts
and berries, you know.

350
00:12:10,547 --> 00:12:12,280
For Christ's sakes.

351
00:12:13,783 --> 00:12:15,883
So, what else we got cookin'?
How about the poconos?

352
00:12:15,951 --> 00:12:17,485
There's all of those
hotels in there.

353
00:12:17,554 --> 00:12:18,586

like it.

timing, and...

357
00:12:24,427 --> 00:12:26,227
But I've been Thinkin'
about it, you know.

358
00:12:26,296 --> 00:12:27,628
It's something
i gotta tell you

359
00:12:27,697 --> 00:12:28,896
sooner or later.

360
00:12:28,964 --> 00:12:30,698
Oh, boy,
listen to this setup!

361
00:12:30,766 --> 00:12:32,667
Come on, Stan.
Cut to the punch line.

362
00:12:34,804 --> 00:12:36,270
I'm retiring.

363
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,708
What are you
talkin' about?

364
00:12:42,312 --> 00:12:44,144
I found a place
in Florida...

365
00:12:44,214 --> 00:12:45,246
When? Today?

366
00:12:45,315 --> 00:12:47,381
No, no. A couple
of weeks ago, you know,

367
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,450
when I thought that
you were set for the winter.

368
00:12:50,587 --> 00:12:52,853
Why? Why would
you do this?

369
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,757
I... I'm tired.

370
00:12:58,595 --> 00:13:00,828
I... I mean,
at least when...

371
00:13:00,896 --> 00:13:02,230
When roz was alive,

372
00:13:02,298 --> 00:13:03,598
I'd come off the road,

373
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,132
there'd be
someone there,

374
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,867
and now
there's no one.

375
00:13:06,936 --> 00:13:08,469
Now there'll
still be no one,

376
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:09,670
and it's
gonna be humid.

377
00:13:09,739 --> 00:13:11,539
Look, my kids
are down there,

378
00:13:11,608 --> 00:13:13,674

are down there.

379

You know
i wanna paint.

380
00:13:16,178 --> 00:13:18,646
So what
happens now?

381
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,948
Well, I... I buy
the place in Florida,

382
00:13:21,016 --> 00:13:22,149
I... I ship
the furniture...

383
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,017
No, to me! To me!

384
00:13:24,086 --> 00:13:25,786

385
00:13:25,855 --> 00:13:26,920
Huh?

386
00:13:26,989 --> 00:13:28,656
I mean, how the hell
does this happen?

387
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,258
How does a brother
quit on a brother?

388
00:13:30,326 --> 00:13:32,460
Buddy, I'm... I'm not
quitting on you.

we've been doin' this
since we were kids.

394
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:44,004
I think I gave it
a pretty good shot.

395
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,172
You deserve
a good shot,

396
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,674

I'm playing condos

397
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:47,908

afternoon.

398

i could get.

399

Because you
don't push.

400

cancel my show

403

to stand up to them.

404
00:13:57,453 --> 00:13:59,052

405
00:13:59,121 --> 00:14:00,421

00:19:50,005 --> 00:19:51,005
Stan!

532
00:19:51,073 --> 00:19:53,006
We can't go. I already
changed our names.

533
00:19:53,075 --> 00:19:54,075
What?
Yeah, yeah.

534
00:19:54,143 --> 00:19:56,009
We're Stan
and buddy young.

535
00:19:56,078 --> 00:19:57,511
See, yankelman
was too long...

536
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,512
What?

537
00:19:58,581 --> 00:19:59,581
It's better.

538
00:19:59,648 --> 00:20:01,014
No, look, you... we
don't belong here.

539
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:03,003
We're funny
at home.

540
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,356
You're frightened.

541
00:20:09,425 --> 00:20:12,392
I can't believe
this! Stan...

542
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:15,529
Every night in bed,
this is all we talk about.

543
00:20:17,533 --> 00:20:19,133
Look, I'm sorry.

544
00:20:19,901 --> 00:20:21,635
Let's just go home.

545
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,038
Ok. Fine.

546
00:20:25,107 --> 00:20:27,107
Go. Go home.
It's ok.

547
00:20:27,176 --> 00:20:28,275
I'll do it.

548
00:20:28,344 --> 00:20:29,643
What do you mean,
you'll do it?

549
00:20:29,711 --> 00:20:30,977
I'm gonna
do the act.

550
00:20:31,046 --> 00:20:32,812
It's our act.
It's for 2.

551
00:20:32,881 --> 00:20:33,980
Who's gonna
do my parts?

552
00:20:34,049 --> 00:20:35,415
I'll do both parts.

553
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,416
Abie.

554
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,651
Buddy.

555
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:40,320
You're gonna be
out there by yourself?

556
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,489
Yeah.

557
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,359
Well, then wear
the bigger jacket.

558
00:20:45,427 --> 00:20:46,360
Why?

559
00:20:46,428 --> 00:20:47,361
It's funnier.

560
00:20:47,429 --> 00:20:48,695
Yeah? Ok.

ready?

562
00:20:51,033 --> 00:20:52,299
Yeah.
Oh, wait, wait.

563
00:20:52,368 --> 00:20:53,500
There's
a slight change.

564
00:20:53,569 --> 00:20:55,135
It's not
the young brothers.

565
00:20:55,204 --> 00:20:56,570

631

We went to the
movies together,

637
00:25:10,826 --> 00:25:12,426
and I stayed here.

638
00:25:12,494 --> 00:25:14,428
I thought you
were in Florida.

639
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,430
I was.

640
00:25:16,498 --> 00:25:18,532
Your uncle Stan
screwed up.

641
00:25:19,401 --> 00:25:20,801
So, what's with you?

642
00:25:20,869 --> 00:25:23,703
You get kicked out of your
apartment again, or what?

643
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:24,805
No.

644
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:28,708

645
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:29,777
Mom gets scared

646
00:25:29,845 --> 00:25:31,010
to be alone
at night,

647
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:33,447
so she asked me
to stay here.

648
00:25:33,515 --> 00:25:36,316
Scared? She never said
anything to me about...

649
00:25:36,384 --> 00:25:38,184
Well, she does.

650
00:25:38,253 --> 00:25:40,587
It's just so typical that
you wouldn't know that.

651
00:25:40,656 --> 00:25:42,088
Don't start.

652
00:25:42,724 --> 00:25:43,824
Ok?

653
00:25:43,892 --> 00:25:45,224
Not today.

654
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:50,129
Thank you for staying
with your mother.

655
00:25:50,198 --> 00:25:51,598
If she had said
anything to me...

656
00:25:51,667 --> 00:25:53,900
Well, it's hard to say
anything to you, dad,

657
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,329
because you're
always talking.

658
00:25:56,772 --> 00:25:58,505
Ok, here we go.

659
00:25:58,574 --> 00:26:00,574
My daughter,
the paper cut.

660
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:01,942
Always talking, huh?

661
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:03,042
You didn't mind
my talking

662
00:26:03,111 --> 00:26:04,377
when I said
to the judge,

663
00:26:04,446 --> 00:26:05,979
"your honor,
I'll pay the store

664
00:26:06,047 --> 00:26:07,614
"for everything
she shoplifted.

665
00:26:07,683 --> 00:26:09,315
"I'll get her into
rehab, your honor.

666
00:26:09,384 --> 00:26:10,951
"I'll pay all
of the court costs,

667
00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:13,019
"and look, here's a little
something for yourself."

668
00:26:13,088 --> 00:26:14,821
You didn't mind
my talking then, huh?

669
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:15,922
Where are
you going?

670
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,524
Away from
your mouth.

671
00:26:17,593 --> 00:26:18,725
What did I say?

672
00:26:18,794 --> 00:26:20,760
What... you're
in your pajamas.

673
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,362
I'll get a cab.

674
00:26:24,432 --> 00:26:26,299

you always do.

What are you
doin' back?

681
00:26:49,992 --> 00:26:52,959
Well, there was
a little mix-up,

682
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,428
but everything is
ok. Don't worry.

683
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:57,797
Glad you're home.

684
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,298
Yeah.

685
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:01,267

686
00:27:01,336 --> 00:27:03,937
Yeah, yeah.
We, uh...

687
00:27:04,006 --> 00:27:05,646
We had a really
nice chat,

688
00:27:05,674 --> 00:27:07,106
and she told me
to tell you

689
00:27:07,175 --> 00:27:08,808
that she's leaving
early in the morning

690
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,544
before you get up.

691
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:15,882
Ahh...

692
00:27:17,986 --> 00:27:19,218
You hungry?

693
00:27:19,287 --> 00:27:22,088
Nah. I had, uh, I had
some Chinese with Stan.

Are you all right?

695
00:27:29,998 --> 00:27:31,497
Oh, sure, sure.

696
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:33,833

takes me a little time

excitement of a show

698

talkin' about?

884
00:36:11,069 --> 00:36:12,735
I need you.

885
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:15,138
Nobody can do for
me what you do.

886
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:18,141
Stan, if it
wasn't for you,

887
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:20,510
I would be
much more successful.

888
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:22,945
Did you see what
i did there, huh?

889
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,047
Did you notice that?

890
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:25,214
Yeah.

891
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:26,449
I saw.

892
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,617
Stan...

893
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:31,454
Stan, everything that we
dreamed about as kids

894
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:33,356
is startin' to happen.

895
00:36:33,425 --> 00:36:35,291
Please, don't leave me.

896
00:36:40,165 --> 00:36:41,431
You know every
night when you bring

897
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:42,779
the fat lady up
from the audience

898
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:44,667
and you ram her in the
ass with your head?

899
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:46,502
Yeah?
You're doin' it wrong.

900
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:48,137
How many ways
are there to do it?

901
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,486
You're tippin' the bit.

902
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,541
You're makin' the face
before you ram the ass.

903
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:52,508
I did not.

904
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:53,476
Yes, you did.

905
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:54,545
Don't tell me.
Shut up.

906
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:55,579
Don't tell me.
Shut up.

907
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:56,646
Don't tell me.
Shut up.

908
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:57,813
Don't tell me.
Shut up.

909
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,648
Don't tell me.

910
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:00,983
Don't tell.
Shut up.

911
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,385
Don't tell.
Shut up.

912
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:06,021
Ok, I'm ready.

913
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:07,990
Hi. Did you
get prettier?

914
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,025
Stan, did she get
pret... Stan.

915
00:37:10,095 --> 00:37:11,461
Stan,
wake up. Stan,

916
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:12,962
Elaine, I'm
talking abou...

917
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:15,030
Try to stay awake
a little while.

918
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,732
Go on,
get out of here.

919
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:18,334
Elaine, these sandwiches
are amazing.

920
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:19,868
Roast pork,
yet they're kosher.

921
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:21,137
I don't know
how they do it!

922
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:26,542
Buddy, funny tonight.
I thought I'd die!

923
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:27,843
Maybe next time.

924
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:31,481
Good night, everybody.
See you tomorrow.

See? They're

It's the gift that

I can't believe
i did that.

934
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:05,114
I'm so embarrassed.

935
00:38:05,183 --> 00:38:06,415
It wasn't that bad.

936
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:09,084
A couple of boats
capsized, but, uh...

937
00:38:10,555 --> 00:38:11,454
Whew!

938
00:38:11,523 --> 00:38:12,988
Ohh.

939
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:14,624
So tell me,

940
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:16,292
how is a woman
wearing your face

941
00:38:16,361 --> 00:38:17,493
still single?

942
00:38:17,562 --> 00:38:19,328
Oh, god, you sound
like my mother.

943
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:21,631
Oh, it's the night air.
Gives me that rasp.

944
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:23,832
"Darling, we're so
proud of you."

945
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:25,768
You know, I think we
have one big relative

946
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:27,002
that we all share.

947
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:28,437
Oh, it's true.

948
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:30,339
"This is what
we sent you

949
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:31,408
"to college for?

950
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:33,376
"So you could be 25
and still single?

951
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:35,511
"Your sister rose doesn't
have half your looks,

952
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,180
"and she's married."

953
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:39,114
You're 25, and you
still come up here

954
00:38:39,184 --> 00:38:40,316
with your parents?

955
00:38:40,385 --> 00:38:42,117
Well, the hotel
has spinster rates.

956
00:38:42,187 --> 00:38:44,587
Wow! Double
off the scoreboard.

957
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:46,289
2 runners
score on that.

958
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:47,623
You're very funny,
Elaine.

959
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:48,624
No...

960
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:50,493
No, you are.
Yeah.

961
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:54,497
I'm trying to
make up with them.

962
00:38:54,566 --> 00:38:55,931
They're angry at me.

963
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,433
Your parents?

964
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:00,703
I was supposed to get
married last month,

965
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:02,071
and I backed out.

966
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:03,406
Oh.

967
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:05,374
My dad lost
the deposit.

968
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,244
It was a nightmare.

969
00:39:08,313 --> 00:39:10,313
I said, "dad, look
on the bright side.

970
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:12,781
"Now 140 cornish hens
don't have to die!"

971
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:19,322
Who were you
supposed to marry?

972
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:21,457
Herb,
"the shower door king."

973
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:23,459
I was at his
coronation!

974
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:27,663
It was
a lovely affair.

975
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:30,566
Oh, he was
all right. He was...

976
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,335
A <i>putz?</i>

977
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:33,469
The biggest.

978
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:37,306
All he ever talked about
was shower doors.

979
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,541
You know,
i started thinking,

980
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:39,842
this is the rest
of my life,

981
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,277
listening to
him whine

982
00:39:41,346 --> 00:39:42,778
about what
New York City water

983
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:44,547
does to a chrome finish?

984
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:50,219
My parents pushed
and pushed, but...

985
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:53,489
It's not
what I want.

986
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,057
What do you want?

987
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:57,860
Ed, "the toilet seat
czar"? He's available.

988
00:40:00,365 --> 00:40:03,098
I don't know
what I want.

989
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:05,468
I don't even know
what there is.

No, no, no, no.

995
00:40:26,658 --> 00:40:27,723
See, I... I...

996
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:30,092
I saw you...
From the stage,

997
00:40:31,228 --> 00:40:33,228
and I wanted
to meet you.

998
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,431
So Stan went,
you know,

999
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,632
to get you, because

1000
00:40:36,701 --> 00:40:39,101
I... I was, you know,
had to change.

1001
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:44,273
This isn't an all-the-time
thing, you know.

1002
00:40:44,342 --> 00:40:47,410
Stan and I spend all our
time workin' on the act.

1003
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:49,612
We don't have
a lot of, uh...

1004
00:40:49,681 --> 00:40:51,647
What are they called?

1005
00:40:51,716 --> 00:40:53,081
Women. Hmm?

1006
00:40:54,419 --> 00:40:55,618
Mm-hmm.

1007
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:02,991
So, what's it like?

1008
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,126
What?

1009
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:06,495
What you do...
Being a comedian.

1010
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:09,699
I just can't imagine
standing up there

1011
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:11,734
in front of all
those strange people.

1012
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:14,537
It's what I do.
You know, it's my job.

1013
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:16,639
It's an odd job,
but it's my job.

1014
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:18,774
I mean, some nights are
better than others.

1015
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:20,275
It's so strange.
Like last night,

1016
00:41:20,345 --> 00:41:22,578
I couldn't buy a laugh.
I mean, nothin'.

1017
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:24,079
The audience
just sat there.

1018
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:27,216
They were like, uh,
nuremberg with drinks.

1019
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:29,117
And it's the same
exact show that you saw!

1020
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:30,386
I mean, I came out,

1021
00:41:30,455 --> 00:41:32,455
and I said, "good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,"

1022
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:33,789
and a guy
in the front row

1023
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:36,492
looks up at me
and says, "oi, English."

1024
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:43,198
But then there are
nights like tonight...

1025
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:45,835
Where I... wow,
i was like...

1026
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:47,436
I don't know. I... I...

1027
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:50,038
I was like Joe Louis,
you know?

1028
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:51,741
I... I came out,
started to jab,

1029
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:53,208
you know, just
feeling 'em out...

1030
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:54,744
"Hey, where you from?"
You know?

1031
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:56,111
"What a crowd!"

1032
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,646
Then I moved in.
Body shots...

1033
00:41:57,715 --> 00:41:59,749
"Lenny, I have to.
But you?" Boom!

1034
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:01,650
"We use the camel
to ride to town, sir."

1035
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:02,985
Boom!

1036
00:42:03,053 --> 00:42:04,687
Then it went right to
the head, the bakery bit...

1037
00:42:04,756 --> 00:42:05,855
"You bought too much!"
Boom!

1038
00:42:05,923 --> 00:42:07,155
"You bought
too little." Boom!

1039
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:08,924
<i>Roumania, roumania.</i>
Boom! And I got 'em.

1040
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:11,260
They're mine. They
can't take any more.

1041
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:13,763
It's the best feeling
in the world.

1042
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:19,334
Until now.

1043
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:23,672
What?

1044
00:42:26,778 --> 00:42:28,110
Table 8...

1045
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:31,881
Polka-dot dress...

1046
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:43,992
It's get... it's gettin'
a little late.

1047
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,628
You know,
your... your parents...

1048
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:46,796
Yeah.

1049
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:33,823
<i>Hey, I got married!</i>

1050
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,980
<i>Yeah, it was
a beautiful affair.</i>

1051
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:38,948
<i>9 killed.</i>

1052
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:43,118
<i>We had a little accident
on the dance floor.</i>

1053
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:44,587
<i>My aunt Sheila
spun out of control</i>

1054
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:46,021
<i>doin' the bunny hop</i>

1055
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:48,624
<i>and wiped out

1056
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:51,259
<i>The rest of
the relatives</i>

1057
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:53,128
<i>were on their

<i>But, hey, I hit a jackpot
the other day.</i>

1080
00:44:58,062 --> 00:44:59,528

1084
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:10,973
<i>She's an eraser,
basically.</i>

1085
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:13,241
<i>My wife gave birth
to an eraser!</i>

1086
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:26,455
<i>I'll tell you, folks,</i>

1087
00:45:26,523 --> 00:45:28,156
<i>I look at my
little girl,</i>

1088
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:30,392
<i>how tiny she is,
and I think,</i>

1089
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:33,128
<i>how can something
you can hold in one hand</i>

1090
00:45:33,197 --> 00:45:35,263
<i>give you such a thrill?</i>

1091
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:36,732
<i>Then I remembered
what it was like</i>

1092
00:45:36,801 --> 00:45:37,900
<i>when I was 14</i>

1093
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:40,135
<i>and I used to lock myself
in the bathroom!</i>

1094
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:43,338
<i>But don't get me
started on that!</i>

1095
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,741
<i>Aw, she's so cute.
What a thrill.</i>

1096
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:47,409
<i>I'll never forget
what my uncle moe</i>

1097
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:49,177
<i>said about little girls.</i>

1098
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:50,913
<i>He said, "officer,</i>

1099
00:45:50,982 --> 00:45:52,481
<i>"she said she was 18!"</i>

1100
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:01,690
<i>But I'll tell you, folks,
there's nothin' like it.</i>

1101
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,726
<i>Nothin' in the world.</i>

1102
00:46:03,794 --> 00:46:06,561
<i>My favorite time is
when the baby's asleep,</i>

1103
00:46:06,631 --> 00:46:08,563
<i>you know, lookin'
all cute and innocent</i>

1104
00:46:08,633 --> 00:46:10,198
<i>and there's a little
bit of moonlight</i>

1105
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:12,367
<i>coming through the window,
shinin' on her face,</i>

1106
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,069
<i>and it's quiet.</i>

1107
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:15,971
<i>All's right with the world.</i>

1108
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,774
<i>And only one thought is
goin' through your mind...</i>

1109
00:46:18,843 --> 00:46:20,142
<i>What stinks?</i>

1110
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:22,778
<i>What the hell
stinks like that?</i>

1111
00:46:22,847 --> 00:46:23,979
<i>You know what it is?</i>

1112
00:46:24,048 --> 00:46:25,748
<i>It's this lady
in the front!</i>

1113
00:46:27,184 --> 00:46:28,483
<i>Nice face, madam.</i>

1114
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:30,853
<i>You look like a</i> toches
<i>with lipstick!</i>

1115
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:32,821
<i>But don't get me
started on that!</i>

1116
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:34,823
<i>Good night, everybody!</i>

1117
00:46:38,062 --> 00:46:39,528
<i>What a night!</i>

1118
00:46:51,776 --> 00:46:54,143
Oh, what a view!

1119
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:56,178
You can see my whole
career from here.

1120
00:46:57,447 --> 00:46:59,181
I mean, there was
the capitol theater...

1121
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:00,482
And the Paramount...

1122
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:02,151
And over there
was the Latin quarter.

1123
00:47:02,186 --> 00:47:04,953
Oh, the Latin quarter was
always a hot room for me.

1124
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:07,622
And then we'd go to the metropole,
hear some jazz,

1125
00:47:07,692 --> 00:47:09,892
then end up at Lindy's,
get a piece of cheesecake,

1126
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,194
and lie about
how good we did.

1127
00:47:12,262 --> 00:47:13,796
Yeah. Great days.

1128
00:47:13,864 --> 00:47:15,698
Yeah. It's great
to see you, Phil.

1129
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:17,733
You, too, buddy.
Come on.

1130
00:47:17,802 --> 00:47:19,201
Ahh, boy.

1131
00:47:20,637 --> 00:47:22,470
I was surprised
to hear about Stan.

1132
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:23,605
Is he all right?

1133
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:25,974
Oh, sure, he's fine.
You know, I... I said to him,

1134
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:27,275
I said, "look, cookie...

1135
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:29,277
"You've been workin'
your whole life.

1136
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:31,546
"Relax. You know,
go down to Florida.

1137
00:47:31,615 --> 00:47:32,915
"Be with your children.

1138
00:47:32,983 --> 00:47:34,249
"Paint your pictures."

1139
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:36,085
You know...
He carried on...

1140
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:37,419
"I can't
leave you, buddy.

1141
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:39,354
"I don't want
to leave you, buddy."

1142
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:40,689
Oh, it broke my heart.

1143
00:47:40,758 --> 00:47:42,624
But it was time
for him to retire.

1144
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:43,926
I mean, he's
gettin' up there.

1145
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:44,927
Yeah, yeah.

1146
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:46,528
So I gave him
a couple of bucks.

1147
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:48,797
Yeah, a couple
of bucks. I, uh...

1148
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,498
I set him up
with a condo.

1149
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:52,101
That was a lovely
thing to do.

1150
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:54,169
He's my brother.
You know, he's a classy guy.

1151
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:56,739
What, are you kidding?
Stan is class.

1152
00:47:56,807 --> 00:47:58,240
I mean, you open
the dictionary

1153
00:47:58,308 --> 00:47:59,608
under "class,"
it's his picture.

1154
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:01,243
Hey, when I was
just a young <i>pisher,</i>

1155
00:48:01,311 --> 00:48:03,145
<i>schlepping</i> acts
up to the catskills,

1156
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:04,880
Stan took me
under his wing.

1157
00:48:04,949 --> 00:48:06,949
He taught me
how to be an agent.

1158
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:08,150
Stan.

1159
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:11,286
So, what can i
do for you?

1160
00:48:11,355 --> 00:48:13,889
Well... you know,
you always said

1161
00:48:13,958 --> 00:48:15,557
that you
liked the act.

1162
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:16,759
What, are you
kidding me?

1163
00:48:16,827 --> 00:48:18,526
Who didn't love
your act?

1164
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:20,929
Just the other day,
i was saying to...

1165
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:21,930
Somebody...

1166
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:23,431
"Remember
buddy young, Jr.?"

1167
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,933
And they got
all excited.

1168
00:48:25,002 --> 00:48:26,882
Oh, yeah?
Who was it?

1169
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:28,536
I'm not...

1170
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:30,038
Well,
where were you?

1171
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:32,741
It was at the... You know, uh,
with the tables.

1172
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:34,843
Well, did you say I was
funny, and they agreed,

1173
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,211
or did you
say my name,

1174
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,612
and they said
i was funny?

1175
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:39,148
I mean,
how did it work?

1176
00:48:39,216 --> 00:48:41,283
Either way.
W-what's the difference?

1177
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:42,918
The point is,
you're a legend.

1178
00:48:42,987 --> 00:48:43,987
You're a giant.

1179
00:48:44,054 --> 00:48:45,174
You're the
comic's comic.

1180
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:46,955
You look in the dictionary
under "funny,"

1181
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:48,024
it's your picture.

1182
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:49,591
Well, I... I appreciate
that, Phil.

1183
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:52,494
I really do, I mean,
especially comin' from you.

1184
00:48:52,562 --> 00:48:54,997
So, I was Thinkin',
maybe, uh, you know,

1185
00:48:55,065 --> 00:48:57,266
you want to take me on,
you know, handle me.

1186
00:48:57,334 --> 00:48:58,801
I don't need
much. I mean,

1187
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:00,502
just a little kick in the
ass to get it over the top.

1188
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:03,638
Hey, hey, buddy, do I want
to handle you? I owe you.

1189
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:05,707
I owe you.

1190
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,810
The business owes you.

1191
00:49:07,878 --> 00:49:10,378
You know, with all
due respect to Stan,

1192
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:12,547
I always thought you
should've been bigger.

1193
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:14,149
Now, maybe i
shouldn't say that.

1194
00:49:14,218 --> 00:49:16,451
No, no. I hear you.
I hear you.

1195
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:18,653
So, come with us.

1196
00:49:18,722 --> 00:49:20,388
We'll do, we'll
make, you'll be.

1197
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:21,589
Great.

1198
00:49:21,658 --> 00:49:22,958
Let me set
something up

1199
00:49:23,027 --> 00:49:24,526
for later
in the week.

1200
00:49:24,594 --> 00:49:25,994
It'll give me a
chance to come up

1201
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:28,297
with a game plan. Uh...

1202
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:29,464
How's Friday?

1203
00:49:29,533 --> 00:49:31,266
It's like today,
but later.

1204
00:49:32,536 --> 00:49:34,069
Ok, 1:00, lunch...

1205
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:36,038
Friar's club?

1206
00:49:36,106 --> 00:49:37,439
<i>Unless you'd rather
eat someplace else.</i>

1207
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:39,041
<i>Yeah, off
Madonna's breasts,</i>

1208
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:41,443
<i>but you got to call so far
ahead for reservations.</i>

1209
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:42,644
<i>Funny.</i>

1210
00:49:42,713 --> 00:49:45,193
<i>Yeah. Berle said
I'm not topical.</i>

1211
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:50,685
Sidney. Sidney,

1212
00:49:50,754 --> 00:49:52,587

Me.

1214
00:49:54,391 --> 00:49:56,158
Make it a ginger ale.

1215
00:49:58,628 --> 00:50:00,295
Are you guys
gonna order lunch,

1216
00:50:00,364 --> 00:50:02,898
or is this one of
them Jewish holidays?

1217
00:50:02,967 --> 00:50:04,766
Ah, now you're
talkin' sense.

1218
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,668
Listen, uh...
You guys order,

I'm meeting somebody.

1221

Who?

1222
00:50:12,877 --> 00:50:14,743

00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,217
My god,
that's terrific.

1227
00:50:22,286 --> 00:50:23,551
Phil gussman's
comin' here

1228
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:25,053
to have
lunch with you?

1229
00:50:25,122 --> 00:50:27,422
It's the strangest thing.
He calls me out of the blue,

1230
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:28,823
said he heard
about Stan,

1231
00:50:28,893 --> 00:50:30,859
how I bought him
the condo and the boat

1232
00:50:30,928 --> 00:50:32,127
and the whole thing.

1233
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:35,463
Anyway, he says he wants
to pitch me a few ideas.

1234
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,665
Well, you know, I thought i
was gonna take this year off,

1235
00:50:37,734 --> 00:50:38,901
but, listen,
I'm not stupid.

1236
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:40,402
I'll listen to
what he has to say.

1237
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:42,104
I don't
blame him.

1238
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,115
Oh.

1239
00:50:47,444 --> 00:50:48,911
Hey,
how you doin'?

1240
00:50:48,979 --> 00:50:50,412
Buddy.
Good to see you.

1241
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,980
What a coincidence.
What?

1242
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:53,848
I was just over at the museum
of natural history,

1243
00:50:53,918 --> 00:50:55,583
visiting your act.

1244
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,620
You look sensational.
Thank you.

1245
00:50:58,688 --> 00:51:00,688
You still combing your hair
with the <i>exxon valdez?</i>

1246
00:51:00,757 --> 00:51:03,491
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Funny. Funny, buddy.

1247
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,261
Seriously, though, jer,
i got to ask you something.

1248
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:08,463
It's upsetting me.
I just heard about it.

1249
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:10,232
I want to know if
it's the truth or not.

1250
00:51:10,301 --> 00:51:11,199
What?

1251
00:51:11,268 --> 00:51:12,767
You and Dean
broke up?

1252
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:14,569
What did you do?
What did you say to him?

1253
00:51:14,638 --> 00:51:15,837
Did you open
a mouth?

1254
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:16,838
What... what happened?

1255
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:18,506
It's 36 years ago.

1256
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:19,507
Really?

1257
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:20,708
Of course.

1258
00:51:20,777 --> 00:51:22,044
My goddamn
paper boy.

1259
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:24,352
If it's not on the roof,
it's in the bushes.

1260
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:26,714
That's funny, buddy.

1261
00:51:26,783 --> 00:51:28,183
It's great
to see you, Jerry.

1262
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:30,218
Good seeing you, buddy.
Good seeing you guys.

1263
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:32,154
Sidney, another pitcher
of Hawaiian punch

1264
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:33,621
for the kids' table.

1265
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:36,058
Remember, fellas,
breathe in, out...

1266
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:38,026
In, out...

1267
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:39,361
Where you goin'?
France?

1268
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:41,529
France? I didn't
plan on it,

1269
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:44,666
but, yeah! Oh, I'm gonna
go on a trolley!

1270
00:51:44,734 --> 00:51:46,534
I'm going now!

1271
00:51:48,072 --> 00:51:49,438
Clear the area!

1272
00:51:49,506 --> 00:51:50,705
France!

1273
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,407
Who was that?

1274
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:53,608
Looked familiar.

1275
00:51:58,349 --> 00:51:59,614
Mr. young?

1276
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:02,617
I'm Mr. young.

1277
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:03,952
How nice
to meet you.

1278
00:52:04,021 --> 00:52:05,620
I'm Annie Wells.
I'm from I.T.I.

1279
00:52:05,689 --> 00:52:06,955
Yeah?

1280
00:52:07,024 --> 00:52:08,323
Phil asked me
to apologize for him.

1281
00:52:08,392 --> 00:52:10,025
He had to fly suddenly
to the coast,

1282
00:52:10,094 --> 00:52:12,527
and he asked me
to fill in for him.

1283
00:52:15,665 --> 00:52:16,965
When's he
gettin' back?

1284
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:19,101
I'm not sure.

1285
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:25,007
When Phil gets back,
then I'll see him.

1286
00:52:25,075 --> 00:52:28,343
I think he was hoping you
and I could get together.

1287
00:52:31,781 --> 00:52:33,382
I have a table
right over here.

1288
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:34,549
Sure.

1289
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:37,886
Excuse me.

1290
00:52:48,132 --> 00:52:49,498
I do have a 1:30,

1291
00:52:49,566 --> 00:52:51,966
but we can get
to know each other.

1292
00:52:54,138 --> 00:52:57,239
This is a very unusual room.
What is it, a club?

1293
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,707
Yeah, it's a club...

1294
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:02,244
Miss, uh... Jones?

1295
00:53:02,312 --> 00:53:04,046
Wells. Annie Wells.

1296
00:53:05,549 --> 00:53:06,948
What are you?

1297
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:09,684
You know... I mean,
what do you do?

1298
00:53:09,753 --> 00:53:13,155
I'm an agent at I.T.I.
I handle comedians.

1299
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:15,323
Now, here's what I thought
we could do today.

1300
00:53:15,392 --> 00:53:16,724
You could give
me some sense

1301
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:18,093
of what you'd
like to be doing.

1302
00:53:18,162 --> 00:53:19,394
You know,
how do you see

1303
00:53:19,463 --> 00:53:22,064
the buddy young Jr. career
developing from here?

1304
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,233
Who's Harry ritz?

1305
00:53:25,302 --> 00:53:27,135
Jack Carter?
Um...

1306
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:29,737
Phil silvers?
Myron Cohen?

1307
00:53:29,806 --> 00:53:31,306
Sheckey Greene?
Perky stiles?

1308
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:32,774
Dick Shawn?

1309
00:53:32,842 --> 00:53:34,376
I'm... I'm sorry.
Am I supposed to know these people?

1310
00:53:34,445 --> 00:53:37,345
Yeah. You are supposed
to know these people,

1311
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:40,082
because they're
great comedians. Great.

1312
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:42,016
Comedians who loved
to be on a stage.

1313
00:53:42,086 --> 00:53:43,885
Professionals who
could take an audience

1314
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:45,487
like they were a herd
of wild buffalo

1315
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:48,022
and move 'em into a corral.
Masters of a craft.

1316
00:53:48,092 --> 00:53:50,392
Well, I guess they
were before my time.

1317
00:53:50,461 --> 00:53:51,693
Everything was.

1318
00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:54,362
Look, miss...

1319
00:53:54,431 --> 00:53:57,765
If Phil wants to give
me the brush, ok...

1320
00:53:57,834 --> 00:53:59,367
But he don't
have to send you,

1321
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:00,868
"30 seconds
over show business,"

1322
00:54:00,937 --> 00:54:02,304
to do it for him.

1323
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:04,906
I'm 40 years past
"so tell me about yourself."

1324
00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:07,542
Mr. young, I assure you,
everyone at the agency

1325
00:54:07,611 --> 00:54:09,211
is very excited
about you.

1326
00:54:09,279 --> 00:54:12,280
No one is very
excited about me!

1327
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:14,316
I'm not excited
about me!

1328
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:16,784
Sweetheart...

1329
00:54:16,853 --> 00:54:19,654
Tell Phil that if he
looks in the dictionary

1330
00:54:19,723 --> 00:54:21,656
under "lying,
rat-faced, two-timing,

1331
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:23,525
"chicken-livered pricks,"

1332
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:25,193
there's his picture!

1333
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:26,461
Look, obviously,

1334
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:29,164
there's been some sort
of misunderstanding.

1335
00:54:29,966 --> 00:54:31,766
I went to Phil
for help.

1336
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:34,068
I never had to
do that before.

1337
00:54:34,138 --> 00:54:35,937
He dances me around
the office, you know,

1338
00:54:36,006 --> 00:54:37,239
and I get
a little excited.

1339
00:54:37,307 --> 00:54:38,840
There's somebody
who believes in me.

1340
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:40,875
So we set up this
meeting. Then I look up,

1341
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,477
and there's this
embryo in a dress

1342
00:54:42,546 --> 00:54:44,379
who don't know me
from a goddamn salami!

1343
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:46,481
Good-bye, Mr. Young.
It was lovely to have met you.

1344
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:48,049
Go take a shit
with your clothes on.

1345
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,551
I got no winter.
Excuse me.

1346
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,653
You know?
I lost my winter!

1347
00:55:07,687 --> 00:55:09,120
<i>Hello?</i>

1348
00:55:09,189 --> 00:55:11,889
<i>Hello. Is, uh,</i>
<i>this Elaine young?</i>

1349
00:55:11,958 --> 00:55:13,057
<i>Yes.</i>

1350
00:55:13,126 --> 00:55:15,627
<i>I got your name
off a men's-room wall.</i>

1351
00:55:15,695 --> 00:55:18,329
<i>It says, "for good soup,
call Elaine."</i>

1352
00:55:19,932 --> 00:55:20,865
<i>Hi, buddy.</i>

1353
00:55:20,933 --> 00:55:22,200
<i>Hi, baby.
How you doing?</i>

1354
00:55:22,269 --> 00:55:23,368
<i>Ok.
Good.</i>

1355
00:55:23,436 --> 00:55:24,702
<i>Are the clubs nice?</i>

1356
00:55:24,771 --> 00:55:26,871
<i>Oh, great, great.
Good bookings.</i>

1357
00:55:26,939 --> 00:55:28,373
<i>Good places, yeah.</i>

1358
00:55:28,441 --> 00:55:29,507
<i>Well, how's it goin'?</i>

1359
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:30,508
<i>Oh, I'm killin' 'em.</i>

1360
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:31,842
<i>Yeah?
Really.</i>

1361
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:33,411
<i>Last night,
i shot a guy,</i>

1362
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:34,945
<i>made all the papers.</i>

1363
00:55:36,349 --> 00:55:38,316
<i>Are you feelin' ok?</i>

1364
00:55:38,385 --> 00:55:39,817
<i>Well, I had
a little problem.</i>

1365
00:55:39,886 --> 00:55:41,926
<i>My hair set off
the metal detector</i>

1366
00:55:41,988 --> 00:55:44,589
<i>at the airport.
It's those clips.</i>

1367
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:48,926
<i>Hey, you know what...
What place I drove by?</i>

1368
00:55:48,995 --> 00:55:50,061
<i>What?</i>

1369
00:55:50,129 --> 00:55:51,563
<i>Remember the 300 club
in Boston?</i>

1370
00:55:51,631 --> 00:55:53,464
<i>Remember I played
there in, like, uh,</i>

1371
00:55:53,533 --> 00:55:55,200
<i>19-ba-ba-ba-boom.</i>

1372
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:56,434
<i>Boston?</i>

1373
00:55:56,503 --> 00:55:58,863
<i>Yeah, come on. Remember?
I had a great show there,</i>

1374
00:55:58,905 --> 00:56:00,271
<i>I was all excited
after the show,</i>

1375
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:01,573
<i>and you and I made love</i>

1376
00:56:01,641 --> 00:56:03,575
<i>right on the makeup table
in my dressing room.</i>

1377
00:56:03,643 --> 00:56:05,310
<i>Don't you remember?</i>

1378
00:56:05,378 --> 00:56:07,845
<i>Buddy...
That wasn't me.</i>

1379
00:56:07,914 --> 00:56:09,046
<i>It...</i>

1380
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:12,317
<i>You see what I did?</i>

1381
00:56:12,385 --> 00:56:14,519
<i>I made you think
it wasn't me, but it was.</i>

1382
00:56:14,588 --> 00:56:16,654
<i>Yeah, you're pretty
funny for an old bag.</i>

1383
00:56:18,091 --> 00:56:19,524
<i>Where are you?</i>

1384
00:56:19,593 --> 00:56:20,991
<i>I'm in a small town.</i>

1385
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:23,361
<i>It's, uh, called
"resume speed."</i>

1386
00:56:25,932 --> 00:56:27,164
<i>I miss you.</i>

1387
00:56:27,234 --> 00:56:28,366
<i>Yeah.</i>

1388
00:56:28,435 --> 00:56:30,368
<i>Buddy, are
you all right?</i>

1389
00:56:30,437 --> 00:56:32,370
<i>Sure, sure.</i>

1390
00:56:32,439 --> 00:56:34,405
<i>It's just
a little quiet.</i>

1391
00:56:36,543 --> 00:56:38,676
<i>So, this guy goes</i>
<i>in a doctor's office.</i>

1392
00:56:38,745 --> 00:56:40,845
<i>Doctor says to him,
"i got good news</i>

1393
00:56:40,913 --> 00:56:42,413
<i>"and bad news," see?</i>

1394
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:44,315
Guy said, "well, uh...

1395
00:56:45,051 --> 00:56:46,451
"What's the good news?"

1396
00:56:46,519 --> 00:56:49,454
Said, "the good news is
you got 24 hours to live."

1397
00:56:49,522 --> 00:56:51,256
He says, "that's
the good news?

1398
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:52,557
"What's the
bad news?"

1399
00:56:52,626 --> 00:56:55,159
He said, "i forgot
to call you yesterday."

1400
00:56:55,228 --> 00:56:57,762
Did you see what
i did there, ma?

1401
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:02,099
Stan? Oh, Stan
is great, yeah.

1402
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:04,135
He's the president
of France now.

1403
00:57:04,203 --> 00:57:06,170
Oh, yeah. You
should've seen him.

1404
00:57:06,239 --> 00:57:07,472
They had this
big revolution.

1405
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:08,740
He led them,
wearing a beret,

1406
00:57:08,808 --> 00:57:10,941
wavin' a big piece
of French bread.

1407
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:12,710
He loves
what he's doin'.

1408
00:57:14,046 --> 00:57:17,382
Mrs. gershen, would you
please hold it down?

1409
00:57:17,450 --> 00:57:19,550
I brought the ice skates,
and we'll go.

1410
00:57:19,619 --> 00:57:21,486
A promise
is a promise.

1411
00:57:24,324 --> 00:57:26,223
Me, I'm doin'
sensational.

1412
00:57:26,293 --> 00:57:27,759
Sensational, ma.

1413
00:57:27,827 --> 00:57:30,127
I played a place
the other night.

1414
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:31,796
You know what
they loved?

1415
00:57:31,864 --> 00:57:34,666
Remember that routine i used
to do about grandma and grandpa

1416
00:57:34,734 --> 00:57:37,802
on the porch at silver beach,
arguing over who's sicker?

1417
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:38,936
Remember?

1418
00:57:39,005 --> 00:57:40,471
"What are
you talking, a fever?

1419
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,674
"106 is not a fever.

1420
00:57:42,742 --> 00:57:46,544
"I was dead for 6 months,
and I never missed a day's work."

1421
00:57:48,682 --> 00:57:51,482
Yeah, they loved
it, loved it.

1422
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:54,485
Big laughs, just like
in the living room, ma.

1423
00:58:12,004 --> 00:58:13,805
It's not so good, ma.

1424
00:58:15,842 --> 00:58:17,709
Things aren't so good.

1425
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:03,788
<i>So, you folks do drugs?
You do drugs or what?</i>

1426
00:59:03,857 --> 00:59:05,097
<i>Yeah!</i>

1427
00:59:05,157 --> 00:59:06,758
<i>Yeah? Oh, that's
something to admit</i>

1428
00:59:06,826 --> 00:59:08,058
<i>in front of a group
of strangers, you bonehead!</i>

1429
00:59:10,062 --> 00:59:12,897
<i>If your I.Q. Gets to 80,
sell, brother man.</i>

1430
00:59:14,233 --> 00:59:15,400
<i>What'd you do today?</i>

1431
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:17,268
<i>Well, I smoked
a couple of joints.</i>

1432
00:59:17,336 --> 00:59:19,470
You want to
come with me?

1433
00:59:19,539 --> 00:59:21,138
Where you goin'?

1434
00:59:21,207 --> 00:59:22,473
I told you
3 times,

1435
00:59:22,542 --> 00:59:24,542
I'm goin' over
to see Susan.

1436
00:59:24,611 --> 00:59:26,043
Watch your pocketbook.

1437
00:59:26,112 --> 00:59:27,044
Buddy.

1438
00:59:27,113 --> 00:59:29,414
Look, maybe
another time, ok?

1439
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:31,048
I'm very tired,

1440
00:59:31,117 --> 00:59:33,751
and I'm not in the mood
for her hostility.

1441
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,686
Well, then
take a walk.

1442
00:59:35,755 --> 00:59:38,088
You're, like, glued
to that chair.

1443
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:41,091
See a movie. Steal a
car. Just do something.

1444
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,493
<i>Drugs are a waste...</i>

1445
00:59:42,562 --> 00:59:44,729
You believe this guy, Elaine?
Look... look at this guy.

1446
00:59:44,798 --> 00:59:46,196
He's performing
in front of people,

1447
00:59:46,265 --> 00:59:47,698
and he's dressed
for a felony.

1448
00:59:47,767 --> 00:59:49,233
I mean, look at this.

1449
00:59:49,302 --> 00:59:50,302
Buddy...

1450
00:59:50,369 --> 00:59:52,470
You call these jokes?
You call this comedy?

1451
00:59:52,539 --> 00:59:54,439
Bye.
I mean, who wrote this crap?

1452
00:59:54,507 --> 00:59:57,642
All right! You guys call
yourselves comedy writers?

1453
00:59:57,710 --> 00:59:59,777
Call yourselves
ex-comedy writers!

1454
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:00,945
You're fired!

1455
01:00:01,013 --> 01:00:01,946
You're fired!

1456
01:00:02,014 --> 01:00:03,581
You're fired! You're fired!

1457
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:05,015
I don't work here!

1458
01:00:05,084 --> 01:00:06,317
You're hired!

1459
01:00:06,385 --> 01:00:07,885
Now you're fired!
Get outta here!

1460
01:00:07,954 --> 01:00:08,719
Buddy...

1461
01:00:08,788 --> 01:00:10,087
Oh, here's
the head genius!

1462
01:00:10,156 --> 01:00:12,389
I don't want to see you
guys anymore! You got it?

1463
01:00:12,459 --> 01:00:14,058
Come on, Woody.

1464
01:00:14,126 --> 01:00:14,992
2 minutes...

1465
01:00:15,061 --> 01:00:16,260
You're fired!

1466
01:00:16,329 --> 01:00:18,463
And get that bird
outta here!

1467
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:21,966
Lorraine!
Now! Out!

1468
01:00:22,034 --> 01:00:23,801
They rewrote my
opening monologue.

1469
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:25,636
I told them
to do it.

1470
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:28,205
You changed my monologue
without asking me?

1471
01:00:28,274 --> 01:00:29,834
Buddy, you can't do the
other monologue.

1472
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:31,909
The sponsor will go crazy.
We'll lose the show!

1473
01:00:31,978 --> 01:00:33,744
We're losin' the show now!
We're dyin' here!

1474
01:00:33,813 --> 01:00:35,746
Look at these ratings, heh?
Look at this, Stan.

1475
01:00:35,815 --> 01:00:37,982
First, we're number 3.
Then, we're number 8.

1476
01:00:38,050 --> 01:00:39,684
Then, we're number 11.

1477
01:00:39,752 --> 01:00:41,318
Now you can't
even goddamn find us!

1478
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:42,787
Here, we're right
here! We're 36!

1479
01:00:42,856 --> 01:00:45,490
36? That's good? From 3
to 36, that's a good thing?

1480
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:47,859
It's... it's just temporary.
You got <i>Davy Crockett</i>

1481
01:00:47,927 --> 01:00:49,093
against you
for a few weeks.

1482
01:00:49,161 --> 01:00:50,928
It's a fad.
It'll go away.

1483
01:00:50,997 --> 01:00:54,298
You don't even see it, Stan.
You don't even see what's happening.

1484
01:00:54,367 --> 01:00:56,266
We're losing the show!
They're gonna cancel me!

1485
01:00:56,335 --> 01:00:57,969
Buddy, I spoke
to the network.

1486
01:00:58,037 --> 01:00:59,604
They're a little concerned
about the ratings,

1487
01:00:59,672 --> 01:01:01,171
but they're more
concerned about you!

1488
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,306
Me?
Yes.

1489
01:01:02,375 --> 01:01:03,875
They're worried about me?
Yes.

1490
01:01:03,943 --> 01:01:05,810
I'm workin'
like a horse here!

1491
01:01:05,879 --> 01:01:08,278
I'm doin' everything,
and I'm getting no support!

1492
01:01:08,347 --> 01:01:09,814
I can't get
a decent joke!

1493
01:01:09,883 --> 01:01:11,763
I ask the fuckin' kid
for a fuckin' sandwich...

1494
01:01:11,818 --> 01:01:12,818
Wait a min...
What?

1495
01:01:12,886 --> 01:01:13,918
I asked for
Russian dressing

1496
01:01:13,987 --> 01:01:15,152
on both sides
of the bread!

1497
01:01:15,221 --> 01:01:16,420
Is that too much
to ask for?

1498
01:01:16,489 --> 01:01:18,756
Buddy!
Don't "buddy" me!

1499
01:01:18,825 --> 01:01:21,526
For 7 years, Stan,
i played every club,

1500
01:01:21,594 --> 01:01:22,594
to every audience.

1501
01:01:22,629 --> 01:01:24,294
Audiences that
couldn't speak English.

1502
01:01:24,363 --> 01:01:26,296
Audiences that wouldn't
laugh, couldn't laugh,

1503
01:01:26,365 --> 01:01:28,298
that were physically
incapable of laughing.

1504
01:01:28,367 --> 01:01:29,800
Bowling balls
with ears!

1505
01:01:29,869 --> 01:01:31,229
And I'm not goin'
back there, Stan!

1506
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:32,603
One minute,
buddy!

1507
01:01:32,672 --> 01:01:33,838
You're fired!

1508
01:01:33,907 --> 01:01:35,139
Damn it!

1509
01:01:36,242 --> 01:01:38,142
I'm gonna do
my monologue!

1510
01:01:38,210 --> 01:01:39,844
I'm the one
who got me here!

1511
01:01:39,913 --> 01:01:41,879
I'm the one
who'll keep me here!

1512
01:01:47,754 --> 01:01:49,854
Hi, daddy!

1513
01:01:49,923 --> 01:01:52,489
Get this off! What's
the matter with you?

1514
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:54,324
What do you let her
wear this for, huh?

1515
01:01:54,393 --> 01:01:55,693

are you doing?

1516
01:01:55,762 --> 01:01:56,861
Ahh!

1517
01:02:00,199 --> 01:02:02,332
Get out of my way!
Get outta here!

1518
01:02:02,401 --> 01:02:04,535
Buddy, I forbid you
to do that monologue!

1519
01:02:06,305 --> 01:02:08,606
You're forbidding me?

1520
01:02:08,675 --> 01:02:12,242
Stanley... let's each do
what we do best, huh?

1521
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:13,878
I'll tell the jokes,

01:04:24,610 --> 01:04:25,610
Who's that?

1565
01:04:25,644 --> 01:04:27,011
Oh, that's me.

1566
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:28,345
What?
Oh, yeah.

1567
01:04:28,414 --> 01:04:30,314
That was Durin' the '60s.

1568
01:04:30,382 --> 01:04:32,783
That's, uh, uh, during
my political period. Heavy satire.

1569
01:04:32,852 --> 01:04:34,985
That was taken at a club
in San Francisco.

1570
01:04:35,054 --> 01:04:36,754
Yeah, it was a...
It was a good time

1571
01:04:36,823 --> 01:04:38,555
'cause there was...
For a comic then,

1572
01:04:38,624 --> 01:04:40,357
there was so
much goin' on...

1573
01:04:40,426 --> 01:04:41,592
You know, the
whole Vietnam bit,

1574
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:44,862
that folk-music fiasco
that was goin' on.

1575
01:04:44,931 --> 01:04:46,864
Yeah. I once
punched Joan baez

1576
01:04:46,933 --> 01:04:48,766
in the mouth
at a peace rally.

1577
01:04:48,835 --> 01:04:51,468
She started it.
Wasn't a fun decade.

1578
01:04:51,537 --> 01:04:53,270
What is that?

1579
01:04:53,339 --> 01:04:55,106
Oh, that's my album.

1580
01:04:56,175 --> 01:04:57,507
<i>Disco Jew.</i>

1581
01:04:58,745 --> 01:04:59,910
Wow.

1582
01:04:59,979 --> 01:05:01,846
Oh, no, no.
It was a big hit.

1583
01:05:01,914 --> 01:05:03,313
It went zinc.

1584
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:06,650
It was a, uh, parody
of that movie,

1585
01:05:06,719 --> 01:05:08,585
the <i>Saturday night fever</i>
movie, you know?

1586
01:05:08,654 --> 01:05:10,855
And, uh, we made
up songs, you know?

1587
01:05:10,923 --> 01:05:12,356
♪ Oi, oi, oi ♪

1588
01:05:12,424 --> 01:05:14,691
♪ I'm almost alive,
almost alive ♪

1589
01:05:14,761 --> 01:05:16,460
♪ oi, oi, oi ♪

1590
01:05:16,528 --> 01:05:18,863
♪ I'm almost alive ♪

1591
01:05:18,931 --> 01:05:21,232
<i>I got a night fever,</i>
you know, stuff like that.

1592
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:22,466
It was a lot of laughs.

1593
01:05:22,534 --> 01:05:23,467
And this?

1594
01:05:23,535 --> 01:05:25,035
Oh, that's my
daughter Susan.

1595
01:05:25,104 --> 01:05:26,503
Yeah, that was taken
in las Vegas

1596
01:05:26,572 --> 01:05:29,974
in 19-ba-ba-ba-boom,
I'll tell you that right now.

1597
01:05:30,042 --> 01:05:32,877
Yeah, I used to bring her up
at the end of the act, right?

1598
01:05:32,945 --> 01:05:35,479
Sit her on a stool,
beautiful pool of light,

1599
01:05:35,547 --> 01:05:37,248
and I'd sing this
song to her...

1600
01:05:37,316 --> 01:05:38,956
♪ You're sugar,
you're spice ♪

1601
01:05:38,985 --> 01:05:40,550
♪ you're everything nice ♪

1602
01:05:40,619 --> 01:05:44,889
♪ 'cause you're
daddy's little girl ♪

1603
01:05:44,957 --> 01:05:46,590
tears streaming.

1604
01:05:46,659 --> 01:05:49,093
Mayhem. The audience
didn't know what hit 'em.

1605
01:05:49,162 --> 01:05:50,828
W-wait. You want
to see somethin'?

1606
01:05:50,897 --> 01:05:52,229
Yeah. Yeah.

1607
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:54,064
Where...

1608
01:05:55,334 --> 01:05:56,600
Here.

1609
01:05:56,669 --> 01:05:57,669
Here.

1610
01:05:57,703 --> 01:06:00,271
Take a look at this.
Here I am on-stage,

1611
01:06:00,339 --> 01:06:02,072
doin' a number,
and that's what won me

1612
01:06:02,141 --> 01:06:05,009
entertainer of the year,
las Vegas, 1958.

1613
01:06:05,077 --> 01:06:07,077
So you have
2 daughters?

1614
01:06:07,146 --> 01:06:09,713
No. That's a girl that
i hired to be my daughter

1615
01:06:09,782 --> 01:06:12,616
when Susan didn't want
to do the act anymore.

1616
01:06:12,685 --> 01:06:15,119
Yeah. It was a good
bit. Really strong.

1617
01:06:15,188 --> 01:06:16,520
Yeah. Hmm.

1618
01:06:16,588 --> 01:06:18,122
I'm Thinkin' about
puttin' Susan

1619
01:06:18,191 --> 01:06:20,357
back in the act now,
you know, but, um...

1620
01:06:20,426 --> 01:06:21,859
I think it
loses somethin'

1621
01:06:21,928 --> 01:06:23,493
when you sing
to a twice-divorced,

1622
01:06:23,562 --> 01:06:25,296
middle-aged drug addict.

1623
01:06:25,364 --> 01:06:27,932
You know, it's not
quite as moving somehow.

1624
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,200
Sit down.

1625
01:06:29,268 --> 01:06:31,969
I have a son who's
a lawyer. Very big.

1626
01:06:32,038 --> 01:06:33,971
Yeah, he lives
anywhere I'm not.

1627
01:06:35,107 --> 01:06:37,507
Anyway, uh...

1628
01:06:37,576 --> 01:06:39,276
So, why are you here?

1629
01:06:39,345 --> 01:06:41,178
I mean, I'm
a very busy man.

1630
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:43,480
In a half-hour, i
give myself an enema.

1631
01:06:43,549 --> 01:06:44,849
It's festival seating.

1632
01:06:47,153 --> 01:06:49,987
I want to get
you some work.

1633
01:06:50,056 --> 01:06:52,122
Look, I know i
wasn't nice to you

1634
01:06:52,191 --> 01:06:53,690
the other day
at the friar's...

1635
01:06:53,759 --> 01:06:55,659
No, no, no. Phil... Phil...
Phil was wrong

1636
01:06:55,728 --> 01:06:57,968
to do that, um,
and I told him.

1637
01:06:58,097 --> 01:06:59,563
Ok, whatever.

1638
01:07:00,666 --> 01:07:02,299
But I'm through.

1639
01:07:02,368 --> 01:07:04,701
There's nothin'
out there for me.

1640
01:07:05,671 --> 01:07:07,704
You don't know me.

1641
01:07:07,773 --> 01:07:09,606
My clients work.

1642
01:07:11,577 --> 01:07:12,676
Sure.

1643
01:07:18,584 --> 01:07:20,904
But if you're
not interested...

1644
01:07:21,921 --> 01:07:23,120
Thanks.

1645
01:07:30,796 --> 01:07:31,996
Annie, right?

1646
01:07:32,064 --> 01:07:32,930
Yeah.

1647
01:07:32,999 --> 01:07:34,164
Annie.

1648
01:07:36,235 --> 01:07:38,468
Get me in front
of an audience.

1649
01:07:39,138 --> 01:07:40,604
Any audience.

1650
01:07:42,942 --> 01:07:45,042
I'm dyin' here.

1651
01:07:45,111 --> 01:07:46,944
Every night
i go to bed,

1652
01:07:47,013 --> 01:07:48,779
there's a little
less of me.

1653
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:53,884
I'll get you
an audience.

1654
01:07:53,953 --> 01:07:55,685
<i>So, I come home,
i find my wife</i>

1655
01:07:55,754 --> 01:07:57,521
<i>in bed with my best friend.</i>

1656
01:07:57,589 --> 01:07:59,990
<i>So I said, "Lenny,
i have to. But you?"</i>

1657
01:08:01,727 --> 01:08:04,428
<i>Oh, yeah. Let me ask
you a question, folks.</i>

1658
01:08:04,496 --> 01:08:06,964
<i>How many of you
actually speak English?</i>

1659
01:08:07,033 --> 01:08:08,465
<i>Show of hands here.</i>

1660
01:08:08,534 --> 01:08:11,168
<i>Hands. Hands. It's the thing
at the end of your sleeve.</i>

1661
01:08:11,237 --> 01:08:13,971
<i>Yeah. Oh, good. I'm working
Ellis island here.</i>

1662
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:16,073
Has he ever done
a warm-up before?

1663
01:08:16,142 --> 01:08:17,808
Um, not per se.
Per what, then?

1664
01:08:17,876 --> 01:08:19,743
He's doing well.
He's getting laughs.

1665
01:08:19,812 --> 01:08:21,245
But he's edgy.
I don't like this.

1666
01:08:21,314 --> 01:08:23,981
<i>Anyway, uh, these 2
Polish dwarfs go into a...</i>

1667
01:08:24,050 --> 01:08:25,615
<i>Yeah, yeah, sure. Ok.</i>

1668
01:08:25,684 --> 01:08:28,618
<i>Uh, we're gonna start</i>
<i>this, uh,</i> ring a bell,

1669
01:08:28,687 --> 01:08:31,255
get a cookie,
talk to a dog,

1670
01:08:31,324 --> 01:08:32,423
win a pile.

1671
01:08:32,491 --> 01:08:34,091
<i>I've had piles.
It's not such a prize.</i>

1672
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:35,892
<i>I'll tell you that.</i>

1673
01:08:35,962 --> 01:08:37,127
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.</i>

1674
01:08:37,196 --> 01:08:38,362
<i>We're gonna bring, uh,</i>

1675
01:08:38,431 --> 01:08:39,997
<i>the host of the
show out now.</i>

1676
01:08:40,066 --> 01:08:42,532
<i>We're going to
bring Fred out, and, uh...</i>

1677
01:08:42,601 --> 01:08:44,734
<i>How are you?
Nice to see you.</i>

1678
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:50,874
<i>Yeah. Ok. So, what
we're gonna do is this...</i>

1679
01:08:50,943 --> 01:08:52,276
<i>When Fred comes out,</i>

1680
01:08:52,345 --> 01:08:55,879
<i>let's give Fred a big,
big standing ovation, ok?</i>

1681
01:08:55,948 --> 01:08:57,014
See?
<i>Anyway,</i>

1682
01:08:57,083 --> 01:08:58,515
<i>so put your
hands together,</i>

1683
01:08:58,584 --> 01:08:59,916
<i>and on the count of 3,</i>

1684
01:08:59,986 --> 01:09:01,918
<i>let's make him feel at home
and we'll all say,</i>

1685
01:09:01,988 --> 01:09:05,155
<i>"Fred, what's with
your fuckin' hair?"</i>

1686
01:09:08,927 --> 01:09:11,561
<i>What? What did I say?
What did I do?</i>

1687
01:09:11,630 --> 01:09:14,198
<i>Here we go! Stand up!
Stand up, goddamn it!</i>

1688
01:09:14,266 --> 01:09:15,932
<i>Let's do this.</i>

1689
01:09:16,002 --> 01:09:17,468
<i>1... 2... 3...</i>

1690
01:09:17,536 --> 01:09:18,668
Fred!

1691
01:09:18,737 --> 01:09:21,038
What's with your fuc...

1692
01:09:21,107 --> 01:09:23,807
I opened for durante.
I opened for Sinatra.

1693
01:09:23,876 --> 01:09:27,711
I don't open for win-a-bedroom-set
on a farkuckta game show.

1694
01:09:27,779 --> 01:09:29,079
It's a good thing.

1695
01:09:29,148 --> 01:09:31,081
A lot of up-and-coming
comics do warm-ups.

1696
01:09:31,150 --> 01:09:32,582
It's a great way
to start out.

1697
01:09:32,651 --> 01:09:34,318
Darling, I'm not starting out.
I'm finishing up.

1698
01:09:34,387 --> 01:09:35,585
There's a big
difference.

1699
01:09:35,654 --> 01:09:37,087
Nothing on me
is up-and-coming,

1700
01:09:37,156 --> 01:09:38,655
I'll tell you
that right now.

1701
01:09:38,724 --> 01:09:40,324
Get me a real job,

1702
01:09:40,393 --> 01:09:43,927
a real thing where people
are coming to see me.

1703
01:09:43,996 --> 01:09:45,896
Have you ever acted?

1704
01:09:45,964 --> 01:09:46,796
Roll it.

1705
01:09:46,865 --> 01:09:48,265
Speed.

1706
01:09:48,334 --> 01:09:49,699
And action.

1707
01:09:52,505 --> 01:09:53,937
"Having fun, sweetie?"

1708
01:09:54,006 --> 01:09:55,572
"I sure am, because

1709
01:09:55,641 --> 01:09:58,042
"with these new
extra-absorbent 'secures, '

1710
01:09:58,110 --> 01:09:59,876
"i can eat and
drink all I want

1711
01:09:59,945 --> 01:10:01,378
"and not have
to worry about

1712
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:02,612
"bladder control.

1713
01:10:02,681 --> 01:10:04,181
"For the first
time in years,

1714
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:05,882
"i can relax and
have a good time.

1715
01:10:05,951 --> 01:10:07,184
"And so can you.

1716
01:10:07,253 --> 01:10:08,618
"To feeling secure."

1717
01:10:10,389 --> 01:10:13,290
Great. All right.
Let's put it on film.

1718
01:10:13,359 --> 01:10:16,493
Uh, hair, makeup, wardrobe,
do what you have to do.

1719
01:10:17,963 --> 01:10:19,563
Buddy, you're great!

1720
01:10:19,631 --> 01:10:21,398
Listen, I'm very
embarrassed about this.

1721
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:23,300
I... I... people'll think
i have this problem.

1722
01:10:23,369 --> 01:10:24,369
No, they're not.

1723
01:10:24,403 --> 01:10:25,569
They'll think
you're a good actor.

1724
01:10:25,637 --> 01:10:27,677
No, but it's not funny.
I'm not funny.

1725
01:10:27,739 --> 01:10:29,306
Buddy, we talked
about this.

1726
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:31,408
Now, I need film
to show people.

1727
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:33,317
Clients are already
talking about using you

1728
01:10:33,379 --> 01:10:34,578
for something else.

1729
01:10:34,646 --> 01:10:36,012
Would you do me
a favor, please?

1730
01:10:36,082 --> 01:10:37,948
Would you look at them
once and smile?

1731
01:10:44,890 --> 01:10:46,223
You're wonderful.

1732
01:10:46,292 --> 01:10:47,157
I'm not funny.

1733
01:10:47,226 --> 01:10:48,358
You're
very charming.

1734
01:10:48,427 --> 01:10:49,593
This is picture, people.

1735
01:10:49,661 --> 01:10:50,894
Quiet, please.

1736
01:10:50,963 --> 01:10:52,196
Ready.

1737
01:10:52,264 --> 01:10:53,430
Everybody settle.

1738
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:54,764
Speed.

1739
01:10:54,833 --> 01:10:55,966
Rolling.

1740
01:10:56,034 --> 01:10:57,234
101, take one.

1741
01:10:57,303 --> 01:10:58,702
Background action.

1742
01:10:58,770 --> 01:11:00,971
All right, now, buddy,
make me love this.

1743
01:11:01,039 --> 01:11:02,506
And... action.

1744
01:11:03,875 --> 01:11:05,309
"Having fun, sweetie?"

1745
01:11:05,377 --> 01:11:08,011
"I sure am, because i
just dropped 2 crab cakes

1746
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:10,247
"into my shorts
and nobody knows."

1747
01:11:10,316 --> 01:11:11,582
Cut it!

1748
01:11:11,650 --> 01:11:12,682
See what I did?

1749
01:11:12,751 --> 01:11:13,883
Listen to me.

1750
01:11:13,952 --> 01:11:15,419
Will you just
listen to me?

1751
01:11:15,488 --> 01:11:17,921
I'm angry at you. Don't eat
while I'm angry at you.

1752
01:11:17,990 --> 01:11:19,523
I worked very hard
to get you that job.

1753
01:11:19,592 --> 01:11:21,258
What did you
do that for?

1754
01:11:21,327 --> 01:11:22,726
Look...

1755
01:11:22,794 --> 01:11:24,161
It's a comic's job

1756
01:11:24,230 --> 01:11:26,296
that if he sees bullshit,
he says "bullshit."

1757
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:27,697
Buddy, that's
not an answer.

1758
01:11:27,766 --> 01:11:28,932
You don't understand...

1759
01:11:29,001 --> 01:11:30,167
Buddy.

1760
01:11:31,970 --> 01:11:33,970
Stan.

1761
01:11:34,039 --> 01:11:35,272
What are you doin' here?

1762
01:11:35,341 --> 01:11:36,973
I... I... I thought
you were in Florida.

1763
01:11:37,042 --> 01:11:39,075
I've been tryin' to find
you. Where you been?

1764
01:11:39,145 --> 01:11:40,277
I was... I was workin'. I...

1765
01:11:40,346 --> 01:11:41,778
Annie, this is my
brother Stan.

1766
01:11:41,847 --> 01:11:42,946
Buddy...

1767
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:45,516
Mom died.

1768
01:11:55,628 --> 01:11:58,828
♪

1769
01:12:16,982 --> 01:12:18,415
At this time,

1770
01:12:18,484 --> 01:12:19,783
if anyone would care

1771
01:12:19,851 --> 01:12:21,518
to say a few words

1772
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:23,320
about rose yankelman,

1773
01:12:23,389 --> 01:12:24,954
you'd be welcome.

1774
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:30,561
Stan, say something.

1775
01:12:30,629 --> 01:12:32,128
You do it.

1776
01:12:32,198 --> 01:12:33,497
Yeah?

1777
01:12:33,566 --> 01:12:34,665
Yeah.

1778
01:12:50,583 --> 01:12:51,682
Ahem.

1779
01:12:53,118 --> 01:12:55,151
What can you say

1780
01:12:55,221 --> 01:12:57,454
about someone
who gave you life?

1781
01:13:00,792 --> 01:13:03,126
You know,
when my brother Stan...

1782
01:13:05,497 --> 01:13:08,599
First told me that our
mother had passed away...

1783
01:13:11,103 --> 01:13:14,070
My first thought was...

1784
01:13:14,139 --> 01:13:16,106
Did you get her recipe
for<i> kugel?</i>

1785
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:23,747
The woman lived
in the kitchen.

1786
01:13:23,815 --> 01:13:26,717
Seriously. She had a bed
put in there and everything.

1787
01:13:27,953 --> 01:13:29,253
Until I was 15,

1788
01:13:29,321 --> 01:13:32,021
I thought my name
was "taste this."

1789
01:13:36,094 --> 01:13:37,294
I'd blow my nose,

1790
01:13:37,363 --> 01:13:38,828
and gravy would come out.

1791
01:13:43,168 --> 01:13:44,268
Yeah.

1792
01:13:45,504 --> 01:13:47,537
She was everything for us.

1793
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:51,642
She cooked for us.
She cleaned for us.

1794
01:13:51,710 --> 01:13:53,277
She had sex
with our father.

1795
01:13:53,345 --> 01:13:55,579
I'm sure that
was no picnic.

1796
01:13:59,618 --> 01:14:02,419
Remember the arms on her?

1797
01:14:02,488 --> 01:14:05,689
She had these
gigantic arms that...

1798
01:14:05,758 --> 01:14:08,592
Th-they weighed more than me
and you, Stan. They did.

1799
01:14:08,661 --> 01:14:11,461
They were... they were like
flesh curtains, these arms.

1800
01:14:14,267 --> 01:14:16,199
She looked like
a Jewish Batman.

1801
01:14:16,269 --> 01:14:18,702
You know, just
this big... cape.

1802
01:14:18,771 --> 01:14:20,203
When she waved good-bye,

1803
01:14:20,273 --> 01:14:22,773
it sounded like
5 people applauding.

1804
01:14:24,277 --> 01:14:25,542
When we were kids,

1805
01:14:25,611 --> 01:14:27,411
we could sneak
into the movie theater

1806
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:28,912
hiding behind those arms.

1807
01:14:28,981 --> 01:14:30,821
The loews pitkin
in Brooklyn.

1808
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:33,183
Am I right, Stan?

1809
01:14:33,252 --> 01:14:34,518
Remember?

1810
01:14:37,456 --> 01:14:40,357
But when she held you
in those arms...

1811
01:14:43,696 --> 01:14:47,030
It was the safest place
in the world to be.

1812
01:14:59,978 --> 01:15:02,413
I loved makin' her laugh...

1813
01:15:04,650 --> 01:15:06,750
Because she had
this laugh...

1814
01:15:08,587 --> 01:15:11,588
Big... big beauty...

1815
01:15:11,657 --> 01:15:14,257
Laugh, you know?

1816
01:15:14,327 --> 01:15:17,260
It would hit you like
a wave at coney island.

1817
01:15:24,203 --> 01:15:26,837
I've done a lot of
things in my life...

1818
01:15:27,406 --> 01:15:28,772
That, uh...

1819
01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:39,650
But I...

1820
01:15:40,486 --> 01:15:41,785
Know...

1821
01:15:41,854 --> 01:15:43,987
That I made
my mother laugh.

1822
01:15:49,294 --> 01:15:50,361
Hmm?

1823
01:15:56,068 --> 01:15:57,534
She was 91...

1824
01:16:00,005 --> 01:16:01,872
And she went
too soon.

1825
01:16:35,574 --> 01:16:37,240
You know what just
occurred to me?

1826
01:16:37,309 --> 01:16:38,509
What?

1827
01:16:38,577 --> 01:16:40,076
We're orphans.

1828
01:16:42,815 --> 01:16:45,416
What's gonna
become of us, Stan?

1829
01:16:45,484 --> 01:16:47,384
What if they take us
to the orphanage

1830
01:16:47,453 --> 01:16:49,887
and the big kids
try to beat me up?

1831
01:16:51,557 --> 01:16:53,524
You know,
you look good...

1832
01:16:53,592 --> 01:16:55,392
For you.

1833
01:16:55,461 --> 01:16:56,794
Oh, yeah.
I... I feel ok.

1834
01:16:56,862 --> 01:16:58,261
Yeah?
Yeah. Not bad.

1835
01:16:58,330 --> 01:16:59,362
Florida's good?

1836
01:16:59,432 --> 01:17:00,497
Yeah.

1837
01:17:00,566 --> 01:17:01,665
Weather?

1838
01:17:01,734 --> 01:17:03,199
Occasionally.

1839
01:17:12,912 --> 01:17:14,344
When you
goin' back?

1840
01:17:14,413 --> 01:17:16,246
Tomorrow.
Oh.

1841
01:17:16,315 --> 01:17:18,816
You know, I just... I had
to settle mom's estate.

1842
01:17:18,884 --> 01:17:20,584
What estate? You take
the housecoat,

1843
01:17:20,653 --> 01:17:23,086
I'll take the slippers.
We're done.

1844
01:17:23,155 --> 01:17:25,255
No. She had
a little.

1845
01:17:25,324 --> 01:17:27,691
I set her up with some
things, some accounts.

1846
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:29,292
Yeah?

1847
01:17:29,361 --> 01:17:31,241
There's a
check here.

1848
01:17:32,197 --> 01:17:34,317
I want you
to have it.

1849
01:17:35,434 --> 01:17:37,400
It's $13,000.

1850
01:17:37,470 --> 01:17:38,769
Oh, no, Stan.
This is too much.

1851
01:17:38,838 --> 01:17:40,070
We should
split this.

1852
01:17:40,138 --> 01:17:42,339
No, buddy. Really,
i want you to have it.

1853
01:17:42,407 --> 01:17:43,907
There's a lot of
dough here. Stan...

1854
01:17:43,976 --> 01:17:47,010
Listen, buddy, the thing
with the cruise...

1855
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:49,112
I felt bad.

1856
01:17:49,181 --> 01:17:51,014
I left you
without a winter.

1857
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:53,643
So please take it, and
then I won't feel bad.

1858
01:17:55,153 --> 01:17:56,386
But you could use this.

1859
01:17:56,455 --> 01:17:58,021
No. I'm fine.
Over the years,

1860
01:17:58,090 --> 01:17:59,790
I stole thousands
from you.

1861
01:18:07,099 --> 01:18:08,732
You see what I did?

1862
01:18:10,035 --> 01:18:11,434
Yeah, I saw.

1863
01:18:14,807 --> 01:18:16,006
Thanks.

1864
01:18:29,287 --> 01:18:31,021
Stan, you know, I've been
watchin' that old t.V. Show,

1865
01:18:31,089 --> 01:18:32,322
<i>the Patty Duke show.</i>

1866
01:18:32,391 --> 01:18:33,524
What, that girl?

1867
01:18:33,592 --> 01:18:35,826
No, Patty Duke. I been
watchin' it from Atlanta.

1868
01:18:35,895 --> 01:18:37,260
What were you
doin' in Atlanta?

1869
01:18:37,329 --> 01:18:38,795
I wasn't in...
Patty Duke.

1870
01:18:38,864 --> 01:18:40,063
Oh, yeah.

1871
01:18:40,132 --> 01:18:41,398
Yeah, it's
confusin' me...

1872
01:18:41,466 --> 01:18:42,799
Identical cousins?

1873
01:18:42,868 --> 01:18:44,200
How the hell
is this possible?

1874
01:18:44,269 --> 01:18:46,703
Weren't the Germans workin' on
something like that?

1875
01:18:46,772 --> 01:18:48,705
But I tell you, this
Patty Duke's sexy.

1876
01:18:48,774 --> 01:18:50,206
Patty Duke is sexy?

1877
01:18:50,275 --> 01:18:51,708
Yeah. Remember
the theme song?

1878
01:18:51,777 --> 01:18:53,209
"Patty likes
to rock 'n' roll,

1879
01:18:53,278 --> 01:18:55,546
"a hot dog makes
her lose control."

1880
01:18:55,614 --> 01:18:57,014
There's a
date I want.

1881
01:18:57,082 --> 01:18:58,682
Bartender, I'll have
a vodka and tonic

1882
01:18:58,751 --> 01:19:00,517
and a Hebrew national
for the young lady,

1883
01:19:00,586 --> 01:19:02,085
and keep them comin'.

1884
01:19:03,055 --> 01:19:04,421
So, this is what
you do all day?

1885
01:19:04,489 --> 01:19:05,756
You watch
television?

1886
01:19:05,824 --> 01:19:07,357
Yeah. What do you
do down there

1887
01:19:07,426 --> 01:19:08,825
besides
retaining water?

1888
01:19:08,894 --> 01:19:11,528
What's a day in
the life of Stan?

1889
01:19:11,597 --> 01:19:12,796
What? I... I get up...

1890
01:19:12,865 --> 01:19:13,897
Good idea.

1891
01:19:13,966 --> 01:19:15,231
I have something.

1892
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:16,833
A cup of coffee
with 9 sugars,

1893
01:19:16,902 --> 01:19:20,003
and you do the cha-cha
for 5 hours. And then?

1894
01:19:20,072 --> 01:19:21,438
I go to the club.

1895
01:19:21,506 --> 01:19:22,940
I play golf
with some friends.

1896
01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:24,307
You have friends?

1897
01:19:24,376 --> 01:19:26,643
Yeah, I have friends.
You know, they come with the condo.

1898
01:19:26,712 --> 01:19:27,945
You get cable
or friends.

1899
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:29,013
I took the friends.

1900
01:19:29,081 --> 01:19:30,280
Over cable?

1901
01:19:30,348 --> 01:19:32,816
In the afternoon,
i paint.

1902
01:19:33,886 --> 01:19:35,351
The light is good.

1903
01:19:35,420 --> 01:19:37,187
It's... it's just right.

1904
01:19:37,255 --> 01:19:39,295
And I sit
by myself,

1905
01:19:39,324 --> 01:19:41,124
and I, uh, take the
phone off the hook...

1906
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:42,492
Who's gonna call?

1907
01:19:42,561 --> 01:19:44,995
That's it. What's the
sense in talking to you?

1908
01:19:45,064 --> 01:19:46,496
Ok. All right.
I'm just playin'.

1909
01:19:46,565 --> 01:19:47,998
I'm just playin'
around, Stan.

1910
01:19:48,067 --> 01:19:50,627
What do you
do at night?

1911
01:19:51,637 --> 01:19:54,504
Sometimes I baby-sit
my grandchildren,

1912
01:19:54,573 --> 01:19:55,839
and, um...

1913
01:19:56,976 --> 01:19:59,042
Also, I'm
seeing a woman.

1914
01:19:59,111 --> 01:20:00,911
What, like,
through a window?

1915
01:20:00,980 --> 01:20:02,312
You're like...

1916
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:04,114
Boris Becker here.

1917
01:20:04,182 --> 01:20:05,348
I'm... I'm
hitting lobs,

1918
01:20:05,417 --> 01:20:06,937
and you're smashing
them back at me.

1919
01:20:06,986 --> 01:20:08,418
No, really? You're
seeing a woman?

1920
01:20:08,487 --> 01:20:09,920
Yeah.
What, like on dates?

1921
01:20:09,989 --> 01:20:12,422
Yes. We go to the theater,
we go to dinner.

1922
01:20:12,491 --> 01:20:16,192
Has she seen those
steamed clams you call balls?

1923
01:20:16,261 --> 01:20:17,560
Buddy, you're a child.

1924
01:20:17,630 --> 01:20:18,929
You're a big,
wrinkled child.

1925
01:20:18,998 --> 01:20:20,363
What is the
matter with you?

1926
01:20:20,432 --> 01:20:21,932
It's not a matter.
I'm just playin'.

1927
01:20:22,001 --> 01:20:23,500
I'm worried about you,
Stan. For god sakes,

1928
01:20:23,568 --> 01:20:24,601
there's all of these

1929
01:20:24,670 --> 01:20:26,402
sexually transmitted
diseases out there.

1930
01:20:26,471 --> 01:20:28,111
Most of which
you started.

1931
01:20:29,407 --> 01:20:31,207
Double off the
wall. Come on.

1932
01:20:31,276 --> 01:20:33,716
We'll sit down
on your laugh here.

1933
01:20:40,052 --> 01:20:43,654
You know, I... I talked
to this, uh, Annie person.

1934
01:20:43,722 --> 01:20:45,588
You know,
she likes you.

1935
01:20:45,658 --> 01:20:46,923
She'll...

1936
01:20:48,927 --> 01:20:51,028
I'm dead.

1937
01:20:51,096 --> 01:20:53,030
I got cancer
of the career.

1938
01:20:53,098 --> 01:20:54,698
It's inoperable.

1939
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:56,733
But it's
good timing.

1940
01:20:56,802 --> 01:20:58,835
I'm out of 8 x 10s.

1941
01:20:58,904 --> 01:21:01,038
Look, buddy...

1942
01:21:01,106 --> 01:21:03,406
If it's over,
you know,

1943
01:21:03,475 --> 01:21:05,008
let it be over.

1944
01:21:05,944 --> 01:21:08,444
Enjoy what you
had, and just...

1945
01:21:08,513 --> 01:21:11,014
I never got
the act perfect.

1946
01:21:11,083 --> 01:21:13,449
You know? I never
got it just right.

1947
01:21:13,518 --> 01:21:15,952
Oh, buddy,
don't start.

1948
01:21:16,021 --> 01:21:18,155
Why couldn't it have
happened, you know?

1949
01:21:18,223 --> 01:21:20,543
I wanted it
so bad.

1950
01:21:20,993 --> 01:21:22,092
To be the guy who,

1951
01:21:22,161 --> 01:21:24,327
when he walked
into the friar's,

1952
01:21:24,396 --> 01:21:26,697
everybody
turns around,

1953
01:21:26,765 --> 01:21:28,765
and they say...

1954
01:21:28,834 --> 01:21:31,101
"Why him, that
lucky bastard?

1955
01:21:31,170 --> 01:21:33,610
"I'm funnier
than him."

1956
01:21:34,206 --> 01:21:36,206
I wanted to
be that guy.

1957
01:21:36,274 --> 01:21:37,554
You know?

1958
01:21:39,578 --> 01:21:40,944
I still do.

1959
01:21:54,492 --> 01:21:55,926
There you are!

1960
01:21:57,629 --> 01:21:59,062
C-come on!

1961
01:21:59,131 --> 01:22:00,864
Don't forget to
marinate it first.

1962
01:22:00,933 --> 01:22:03,453
Would you get
out of the cab?

1963
01:22:04,002 --> 01:22:06,336
Oh, boy.

1964
01:22:06,404 --> 01:22:08,538
Look... look at you. Look
at what you look like.

1965
01:22:08,607 --> 01:22:09,672
I took a nap.
It got late.

1966
01:22:09,742 --> 01:22:11,507
Didn't my assistant tell
you this was important?

1967
01:22:11,576 --> 01:22:12,709
Hey, what are
you doin'?

1968
01:22:12,778 --> 01:22:14,211
I could get excited.
I could get an erection.

1969
01:22:14,279 --> 01:22:15,411
It could kill
me. Stop!

1970
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:16,613
We're meeting
Larry meyerson.

1971
01:22:16,681 --> 01:22:18,148
Who's that?

1972
01:22:18,217 --> 01:22:19,482
Who is that?

1973
01:22:19,551 --> 01:22:21,684
The hottest director
in Hollywood!

1974
01:22:21,754 --> 01:22:23,453
Listen, I'm having dinner
with him last night,

1975
01:22:23,521 --> 01:22:24,621
and I mention
your name,

1976
01:22:24,689 --> 01:22:26,589
and he goes insane.
It turns out

1977
01:22:26,658 --> 01:22:29,138
he's the buddy young
fanatic of the universe.

1978
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:30,593
He knows all
of your routines.

1979
01:22:30,662 --> 01:22:31,828
He worships you.
So?

1980
01:22:31,897 --> 01:22:33,630
So, he's casting
a picture.

1981
01:22:33,698 --> 01:22:34,998
There's a big part.

1982
01:22:35,067 --> 01:22:36,867
The character
is named buddy.

1983
01:22:36,935 --> 01:22:38,268
He wrote it
to be you,

1984
01:22:38,336 --> 01:22:39,469
but he thought
you were dead.

1985
01:22:39,537 --> 01:22:40,904
You mean I'm not?

1986
01:22:40,973 --> 01:22:42,172
Shut up!

1987
01:22:42,241 --> 01:22:44,007
Listen, big actors...

1988
01:22:44,076 --> 01:22:46,009
Their tongues are hanging
out to play this part,

1989
01:22:46,078 --> 01:22:47,078
and he wants you.

1990
01:22:47,112 --> 01:22:48,645
Do you realize what
this could mean?

1991
01:22:48,713 --> 01:22:49,946
I left my hair home.

1992
01:22:50,015 --> 01:22:51,375
Listen, i
gotta go home.

1993
01:22:51,416 --> 01:22:53,349
Underneath my hat is
bacon strips. It's a horror.

1994
01:22:53,418 --> 01:22:54,851
No, buddy!
Come on!

1995
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:56,787
No. There's a way that
i like to meet people.

1996
01:22:56,855 --> 01:22:58,288
Buddy! He's
waiting in here.

1997
01:22:58,356 --> 01:22:59,790
No, I can't go in.

1998
01:22:59,858 --> 01:23:01,291
You look fine.
Come on.

1999
01:23:01,359 --> 01:23:03,994
Look at us. We're
the barelli brothers here.

2000
01:23:05,764 --> 01:23:07,130
Oh, my god.

2001
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:11,567
Oh, my god.
I don't believe it.

2002
01:23:11,636 --> 01:23:13,937
How do you do?
How do you do?

2003
01:23:14,006 --> 01:23:15,371
I'm Larry meyerson.

2004
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:17,174
I love your work.

2005
01:23:17,242 --> 01:23:19,682
I'm buddy young, Jr.,
and you have no taste.

2006
01:23:19,744 --> 01:23:21,577
Thank you.

2007
01:23:21,646 --> 01:23:23,246
No, no, I'm just
jokin'. Seriously,

2008
01:23:23,315 --> 01:23:25,381
I want to tell you,
I'm a very, very big fan.

2009
01:23:25,450 --> 01:23:26,917
I have seen
all of the movies.

2010
01:23:26,985 --> 01:23:28,785
They're fun for
the entire family,

2011
01:23:28,854 --> 01:23:30,253
and, uh, do
we order out,

2012
01:23:30,322 --> 01:23:31,754
or do we get
to sit down here?

2013
01:23:31,824 --> 01:23:33,924
Oh, I'm sorry. Sit.
Sit, please.

2014
01:23:35,994 --> 01:23:39,229
I'm... I'm sorry.
I'm... I'm... I'm actin' like a... a fool here...

2015
01:23:39,298 --> 01:23:40,430
This is so
weird for me.

2016
01:23:40,498 --> 01:23:41,658
What?

2017
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:43,433
Well, I'll tell
you what. 1956, ok?

2018
01:23:43,501 --> 01:23:45,101
I'm 8 years old.

2019
01:23:45,170 --> 01:23:47,204
I'm in... I'm in grossinger's
with my family, we're having dinner,

2020
01:23:47,272 --> 01:23:48,939
and the door flies open.

2021
01:23:49,007 --> 01:23:50,740
Who walks in?

2022
01:23:50,809 --> 01:23:52,142
Buddy young, Jr.,
walks in.

2023
01:23:52,211 --> 01:23:53,576
Everybody in the entire
dining room...

2024
01:23:53,645 --> 01:23:54,777
I don't remember
how big it was...

2025
01:23:54,847 --> 01:23:56,279
Everybody
stopped eating.

2026
01:23:56,348 --> 01:23:57,714
Now I know
you're lying.

2027
01:23:57,782 --> 01:23:59,582
They never stopped
eating at grossinger's.

2028
01:23:59,651 --> 01:24:00,884
No, it's true.

2029
01:24:00,953 --> 01:24:02,618
Never. They didn't
even have tables there.

2030
01:24:02,687 --> 01:24:04,020
They had troughs.

2031
01:24:04,089 --> 01:24:05,688
People just...
On their knees, going...

2032
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:11,728
Miles of
pickled herring,

2033
01:24:11,796 --> 01:24:13,263
which is not
attractive in a mouth

2034
01:24:13,332 --> 01:24:14,612
when they're talkin'...

2035
01:24:14,666 --> 01:24:17,234
"Harry, have the waiter
get me more onions.

2036
01:24:17,302 --> 01:24:18,969
"I want to
smell worse.

2037
01:24:19,037 --> 01:24:20,871
"I don't smell bad enough
with my breath."

2038
01:24:20,939 --> 01:24:22,705
You know, it was
an amazing place.

2039
01:24:22,774 --> 01:24:26,076
Ok, this time... this time,
they stopped eating, and they applauded.

2040
01:24:26,144 --> 01:24:28,245
You glided
into the room.

2041
01:24:28,313 --> 01:24:31,381
We... it was like... It was like
a king came into the room.

2042
01:24:31,449 --> 01:24:34,684
It was the greatest entrance
i have ever seen in my life.

2043
01:24:34,753 --> 01:24:36,586
I... you...
I ran up to you.

2044
01:24:36,654 --> 01:24:38,521
I'm... I'm 8 years old
now, remember, ok?

2045
01:24:38,590 --> 01:24:39,923
I ran up to you
and I told you

2046
01:24:39,992 --> 01:24:41,724
I wanted to be a
comedian when I grew up.

2047
01:24:41,793 --> 01:24:43,126
Really? And
wh-what did I say?

2048
01:24:43,195 --> 01:24:44,394
I'll tell you
exactly what you said.

2049
01:24:44,462 --> 01:24:46,229
You turned to the person
you were standing with,

2050
01:24:46,298 --> 01:24:47,864
you pointed at me,
and you said,

2051
01:24:47,933 --> 01:24:50,466
"look what just
fell out of my nose."

2052
01:24:53,272 --> 01:24:54,905
And that was
funny to you?

2053
01:24:54,973 --> 01:24:57,374
Yeah. I... I was
8 years old.

2054
01:24:57,442 --> 01:24:59,642
Now I'm nervous about
bein' in this movie.

2055
01:24:59,711 --> 01:25:01,144
Larry, is this
funny to you?

2056
01:25:01,213 --> 01:25:02,645
Look.
I'm Karl Malden.

2057
01:25:02,714 --> 01:25:04,474
"Never carry cash.
Whatever."

2058
01:25:05,583 --> 01:25:06,583
How about this?

2059
01:25:06,618 --> 01:25:07,784
The girlie
from <i>star wars</i>

2060
01:25:07,852 --> 01:25:09,119
with the bialys
on her head.

2061
01:25:09,187 --> 01:25:11,821
"Luke. I need
you, Luke.

2062
01:25:11,890 --> 01:25:13,456
"Give me the force."

2063
01:25:13,525 --> 01:25:15,458
Look.
I'm a hasidic Baker.

2064
01:25:15,527 --> 01:25:18,128
"I'll have it Thursday for you.
I'll have it Thursday for you.

2065
01:25:18,196 --> 01:25:19,462
"I'll have it
Thursday.

2066
01:25:19,531 --> 01:25:21,064
"I don't got
no pumpernickel.

2067
01:25:21,133 --> 01:25:22,698
"We're closed,
you little bastards."

2068
01:25:22,767 --> 01:25:24,034
You can do this bit.
You can do

2069
01:25:24,102 --> 01:25:25,902
that interviewing the
basketball players

2070
01:25:25,971 --> 01:25:27,011
after the game,

2071
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:28,538
you know, in
the locker room.

2072
01:25:28,606 --> 01:25:30,540
You go, "hey, you
played a great game.

2073
01:25:30,608 --> 01:25:33,043
"Really, not only that, you're a very
impressive young man.

2074
01:25:33,111 --> 01:25:35,412
"I swear, I've never
seen a poppy-seeded one.

2075
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:37,780
"Look at you.
You're a credit to men.

2076
01:25:37,849 --> 01:25:39,849
"Wait, wait. Look. Here.

2077
01:25:39,918 --> 01:25:41,184
"Now, you're Jewish."

2078
01:25:41,253 --> 01:25:42,919
There you go.
Look, I'm literally...

2079
01:25:42,988 --> 01:25:44,421
I'm literally
on a roll.

2080
01:25:44,489 --> 01:25:45,688
See, now, look.

2081
01:25:45,757 --> 01:25:47,424
Now I'm on a roll.

2082
01:25:47,492 --> 01:25:48,624
Now I'm
uncomfortable.

2083
01:25:48,693 --> 01:25:51,361
Whatever.
What a time.

2084
01:25:51,430 --> 01:25:54,530
So, Larry, I was telling
buddy about this part.

2085
01:25:54,599 --> 01:25:55,966
Oh, the movie, right.

2086
01:25:56,034 --> 01:25:58,969
Sorry. I got so excited,
I'm acting like a fan.

2087
01:25:59,037 --> 01:26:00,470
I am a fan.

2088
01:26:00,538 --> 01:26:01,978
Anyway, look.
Here's the, uh, script.

2089
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:04,740
I want you to take
it home with you, ok?

2090
01:26:04,809 --> 01:26:05,842
Ok.

2091
01:26:09,547 --> 01:26:11,181
See what
i did there? Huh?

2092
01:26:11,249 --> 01:26:12,715
That's called
a lead-away.

2093
01:26:12,784 --> 01:26:14,584
You do the punch, then
lead the audience away.

2094
01:26:14,652 --> 01:26:16,686
The greatest lead-away man
in the history of ever

2095
01:26:16,754 --> 01:26:17,820
was fat Jack e. Leonard.

2096
01:26:17,889 --> 01:26:19,222
You don't even
remember fat Jack.

2097
01:26:19,291 --> 01:26:20,790
Jack e. Leonard.
No, I don't think...

2098
01:26:20,859 --> 01:26:22,192
Unless he's the same
Jack e. Leonard

2099
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:23,493
from <i>the Jack</i>
<i>paar show?</i>

2100
01:26:23,561 --> 01:26:24,961
"Was the ground
cold when

2101
01:26:25,030 --> 01:26:27,430
"you got up this morning? I certainly hope it was."
Big fat guy?

2102
01:26:27,499 --> 01:26:29,299
How about
Harry ritz, huh?

2103
01:26:29,368 --> 01:26:30,766
"Don't holler!"

2104
01:26:36,141 --> 01:26:37,840
So, um,
in the script,

2105
01:26:37,909 --> 01:26:40,943
it's... it's clear which
part is for buddy?

2106
01:26:41,013 --> 01:26:42,112
Yeah. Buddy.

2107
01:26:42,180 --> 01:26:44,780
Actually, the character
is called "buddy."

2108
01:26:44,849 --> 01:26:47,217
You know, we were thinking
about buddy when we wrote it.

2109
01:26:47,285 --> 01:26:48,818
I... until I bumped
into Annie, uh,

2110
01:26:48,887 --> 01:26:51,554
I... I didn't know you were,
you know, still around, and, uh...

2111
01:26:51,623 --> 01:26:52,788
It's the grandfather.

2112
01:26:52,857 --> 01:26:54,457
It's the largest part.
It's a big part.

2113
01:26:54,526 --> 01:26:55,858
It's a very big
part in the film.

2114
01:26:55,927 --> 01:26:58,061
Buddy, I have a really
good feeling about you

2115
01:26:58,130 --> 01:26:59,562
for the part.
I really do.

2116
01:26:59,631 --> 01:27:01,031
I just have to...
I have to know

2117
01:27:01,099 --> 01:27:02,565
that you can read
lines. That's all.

2118
01:27:02,634 --> 01:27:04,134
Look, I'm not looking
for Olivier.

2119
01:27:04,202 --> 01:27:05,535
Good,
'cause he's dead.

2120
01:27:05,603 --> 01:27:07,403
You'd never
find him.

2121
01:27:08,973 --> 01:27:11,607
Buddy, I... I... I really
want this to happen.

2122
01:27:18,216 --> 01:27:20,016
I really have to get
to the airport.

2123
01:27:20,085 --> 01:27:22,185
I guess I'm just gonna
have to miss him.

2124
01:27:22,254 --> 01:27:24,120
Oh, that's a shame.
Yeah.

2125
01:27:24,189 --> 01:27:26,589
Well, it was really good
to see you again, Stan.

2126
01:27:26,658 --> 01:27:28,324
It was great
seein' everybody.

2127
01:27:28,393 --> 01:27:30,093
I'm sorry
i missed Jeffrey,

2128
01:27:30,162 --> 01:27:31,928
but Susan
looked great.

2129
01:27:31,996 --> 01:27:33,796
Really. Is she, uh...

2130
01:27:36,435 --> 01:27:37,833
It'll be ok.

2131
01:27:39,003 --> 01:27:40,103
Yeah.

2132
01:27:41,306 --> 01:27:43,239
We really
miss you, Stan.

2133
01:27:43,308 --> 01:27:45,175
So come on down.

2134
01:27:45,243 --> 01:27:46,943
Put buddy in one of
those dog carriers,

2135
01:27:47,011 --> 01:27:48,511
and get on a plane.

2136
01:27:48,580 --> 01:27:50,246
We will.

2137
01:27:50,315 --> 01:27:51,875
Ok.
Ok.

2138
01:27:58,356 --> 01:28:00,423
Do you think
i let him down?

2139
01:28:01,626 --> 01:28:03,460
Of course not.

2140
01:28:03,528 --> 01:28:07,297
No, Stan. You worked
like a horse for him.

2141
01:28:07,365 --> 01:28:08,898
He's just
mad at you

2142
01:28:08,967 --> 01:28:11,234
because you
have a life.

2143
01:28:11,303 --> 01:28:12,469
I have a life?

2144
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:13,636
Yes, you.

2145
01:28:13,705 --> 01:28:15,472
He has you.

2146
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:17,240
That's a life.

2147
01:28:17,309 --> 01:28:19,209
I would take
that life.

2148
01:28:24,882 --> 01:28:26,616
I knew a
long time ago

2149
01:28:26,684 --> 01:28:29,119
that he needed
more than me.

2150
01:28:29,187 --> 01:28:30,853
He needs the show.

2151
01:28:32,124 --> 01:28:33,656
No matter how much
i love him,

2152
01:28:33,725 --> 01:28:35,391
and I do,

2153
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:38,461
he needs that
extra little hug

2154
01:28:38,530 --> 01:28:41,030
that he can only
get from strangers.

2155
01:28:44,536 --> 01:28:45,735
Well...

2156
01:28:47,139 --> 01:28:48,338
Go. Go.

2157
01:28:51,009 --> 01:28:52,074
Mmm.

2158
01:28:55,046 --> 01:28:56,179
Thank god
you're still here.

2159
01:28:56,248 --> 01:28:57,280
Why?
What's wrong?

2160
01:28:57,349 --> 01:28:58,648
Mom died again.

2161
01:28:58,716 --> 01:29:00,583
For god sakes, buddy,
i... I got a cab waiting.

2162
01:29:00,652 --> 01:29:02,652
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Elaine, make some tea.

2163
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:04,154
Buddy,
he's gotta go.

2164
01:29:04,222 --> 01:29:05,655
I know.
Make some tea.

2165
01:29:05,723 --> 01:29:07,657
Buddy, I got a cab
waiting here.

2166
01:29:07,725 --> 01:29:09,659
I'm suffering
from acute late.

2167
01:29:09,727 --> 01:29:11,661
What is it?
I got to get goin'.

2168
01:29:11,729 --> 01:29:13,729
Yeah, yeah. This will
only take a second.

2169
01:29:13,798 --> 01:29:17,433
I just had a meeting
with Larry meyerson.

2170
01:29:17,502 --> 01:29:18,768
What, the director?

2171
01:29:18,836 --> 01:29:21,571
No, the gorilla breeder.
Yeah, the director, schmuck.

2172
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:24,440
He's the biggest
director in Hollywood.

2173
01:29:24,509 --> 01:29:25,841
Come here.

2174
01:29:29,747 --> 01:29:32,382
He wants me
to audition

2175
01:29:32,450 --> 01:29:34,784
for a big part
in his new movie.

2176
01:29:34,852 --> 01:29:37,019
Buddy, that's...
That's fabulous.

2177
01:29:37,088 --> 01:29:38,368
That... that is wonderful.

2178
01:29:38,423 --> 01:29:41,357
Yeah, but I'm lookin'
it over in the cab, right?

2179
01:29:41,426 --> 01:29:43,092
And...

2180
01:29:43,161 --> 01:29:45,828
It's got a lot of words
and a lot of emotions,

2181
01:29:45,897 --> 01:29:47,997
you know? And i
have to audition.

2182
01:29:48,066 --> 01:29:49,865
So you talk to Annie.

2183
01:29:49,934 --> 01:29:52,435
You tell her to get you
a coach or somethin'.

2184
01:29:52,504 --> 01:29:54,824
Buddy, you'll...
You'll be great.

2185
01:29:55,574 --> 01:29:58,208
Listen, i-I'm sorry,
but I'm so late.

2186
01:29:58,276 --> 01:29:59,709
I gotta...
I gotta go.

2187
01:29:59,777 --> 01:30:00,943
I gotta go.
Stan. Stan.

2188
01:30:01,012 --> 01:30:03,479
Stan, I was hopin'

2189
01:30:03,548 --> 01:30:05,448
that you would
stay a few days.

2190
01:30:05,517 --> 01:30:07,450
You know, we have
the shorthand.

2191
01:30:07,519 --> 01:30:08,884
You know, you know me.

2192
01:30:08,953 --> 01:30:11,754
Buddy, Friday's my grandson's
birthday in Florida.

2193
01:30:11,823 --> 01:30:14,224
You know, Scotty.
He... he's gonna be 3.

2194
01:30:14,292 --> 01:30:16,259
Stan, they'll
hire a clown.

2195
01:30:16,328 --> 01:30:18,127
He'll think it's you.

2196
01:30:19,897 --> 01:30:21,664
Look, come here.
Come here.

2197
01:30:21,733 --> 01:30:23,299
Buddy, I really...

2198
01:30:23,368 --> 01:30:24,400
What?

2199
01:30:24,469 --> 01:30:26,369
Shh. Shh. Shh.

2200
01:30:26,438 --> 01:30:29,305
I want this part,
very badly.

2201
01:30:30,108 --> 01:30:31,307
This could be for me

2202
01:30:31,376 --> 01:30:34,544
what <i>sunshine boys</i>
was for George.

2203
01:30:34,613 --> 01:30:37,213
It would be nice
for Elaine.

2204
01:30:37,282 --> 01:30:40,383
She hasn't seen me doing
so good in a long time.

2205
01:30:41,586 --> 01:30:42,952
Please, Stan.

2206
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:45,288
Be with me.

2207
01:30:45,357 --> 01:30:47,423
Everything good that
ever happened to me,

2208
01:30:47,492 --> 01:30:49,425
you were there.

2209
01:30:49,494 --> 01:30:51,227
Everything bad that
ever happened to you,

2210
01:30:51,296 --> 01:30:52,729
I was there.

2211
01:30:52,797 --> 01:30:54,397
I was always there.

2212
01:30:55,267 --> 01:30:56,799
So be there now.

2213
01:31:04,142 --> 01:31:05,775
Yeah, but she'd be difficult.

2214
01:31:05,843 --> 01:31:06,942
She's terrific.

2215
01:31:07,011 --> 01:31:08,378
And she'd be perfect
for this part.

2216
01:31:08,446 --> 01:31:10,446
She read the script,
and she really likes it.

2217
01:31:10,515 --> 01:31:12,448

Hi.

And this is
my brother Stan.

2238
01:31:45,082 --> 01:31:46,115
Hello.

2239
01:31:46,184 --> 01:31:48,318
Oh. Hi. Very nice
to meet you.

2240
01:31:48,386 --> 01:31:49,586
Larry meyerson.

2241
01:31:49,621 --> 01:31:51,253
Yeah, Stan passed away
4 months ago.

2242
01:31:51,323 --> 01:31:53,289
I haven't had the
heart to tell him.

2243
01:31:53,358 --> 01:31:54,490
Try to cheer down.

2244
01:31:54,559 --> 01:31:56,559
Anyway, I gotta
tell you,

2245
01:31:56,628 --> 01:31:57,694
I read the script,

2246
01:31:57,762 --> 01:32:00,229
and it is
really terrible.

2247
01:32:00,298 --> 01:32:02,765
No, I'm just
playin' around.

2248
01:32:02,834 --> 01:32:05,100
It really is...
Horrible. I'm shocked.

2249
01:32:05,169 --> 01:32:06,969
We had to hold it
outside the cab

2250
01:32:07,038 --> 01:32:08,771
because of
the stench.

2251
01:32:08,840 --> 01:32:10,506
Ok. Let's
get started.

2252
01:32:10,575 --> 01:32:13,175
How do we begin
this march to stardom?

2253
01:32:18,316 --> 01:32:20,550
Ok, buddy, look.
Something's, uh, come up.

2254
01:32:20,618 --> 01:32:22,852
About, uh,
3 weeks ago,

2255
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:25,221
we, uh, we offered the
part to Walter matthau.

2256
01:32:25,289 --> 01:32:26,922
And he wasn't
interested at the time.

2257
01:32:27,425 --> 01:32:28,524
Um...

2258
01:32:30,294 --> 01:32:32,194
This morning,
matthau's agent called,

2259
01:32:32,263 --> 01:32:34,096
and he's doing it.

2260
01:32:39,103 --> 01:32:40,269
Show biz.

2261
01:32:42,139 --> 01:32:43,939
Oh, why didn't you call me?

2262
01:32:44,008 --> 01:32:45,641
We did try to contact
you this morning.

2263
01:32:45,710 --> 01:32:48,110
No, no, no, you didn't.
I was in my office all morning.

2264
01:32:48,179 --> 01:32:50,346
Annie.
Annie. Annie.

2265
01:32:50,415 --> 01:32:53,182
Annie, can I talk to
buddy for a minute? Ok?

2266
01:32:53,852 --> 01:32:54,884
Ok.

2267
01:32:55,987 --> 01:32:57,319
Thank you.

2268
01:32:59,323 --> 01:33:00,556
Now, look.

2269
01:33:00,625 --> 01:33:02,024
I still want buddy
in the picture.

2270
01:33:02,093 --> 01:33:03,926
There's another part.
You read the script?

2271
01:33:03,995 --> 01:33:05,227
Sure.

2272
01:33:05,296 --> 01:33:07,864
Ok. The doctor who
comes in in, uh, act 3.

2273
01:33:07,932 --> 01:33:09,965
He has 3 big scenes.
They're very good scenes.

2274
01:33:10,034 --> 01:33:11,467
Uh-huh.

2275
01:33:11,536 --> 01:33:13,176
I really think it's...
I... I really think

2276
01:33:13,237 --> 01:33:15,437
buddy could score
with that part.

2277
01:33:15,940 --> 01:33:17,139
Now, look, I know
you prepared

2278
01:33:17,208 --> 01:33:18,908
the grandfather
for today, ok?

2279
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:20,543
So you could come
in and read that,

2280
01:33:20,612 --> 01:33:22,645
and that will serve as your
reading for the doctor.

2281
01:33:22,714 --> 01:33:24,580
Or if you want, you
can take some time,

2282
01:33:24,649 --> 01:33:26,148
look at the
doctor's part,

2283
01:33:26,217 --> 01:33:27,917
and come in
and read that.

2284
01:33:27,985 --> 01:33:29,351
That's your call.

2285
01:33:29,421 --> 01:33:31,521
Whatever you want
to do. Ok?

2286
01:33:33,892 --> 01:33:37,026
I... I really think
this can work,

2287
01:33:37,094 --> 01:33:39,595
and I... I apologize
for all the confusion,

2288
01:33:39,664 --> 01:33:42,298
but, uh... I hope
you understand.

2289
01:33:42,366 --> 01:33:44,434
Hey, you
got matthau.

2290
01:33:44,502 --> 01:33:46,335
That's secretariat.
That's man o' war.

2291
01:33:46,404 --> 01:33:48,938
I mean, you got
to bet on them.

2292
01:33:49,006 --> 01:33:50,239
Could I have
one minute

2293
01:33:50,308 --> 01:33:52,475
to talk
to my <i>consigliere?</i>

2294
01:33:52,544 --> 01:33:55,377
Yeah, of course.
Sure. Take all the time you need, ok?

2295
01:33:55,447 --> 01:33:56,746
Ok. Thanks.

2296
01:34:01,285 --> 01:34:02,725
Did you get in touch
with him or not?

2297
01:34:02,787 --> 01:34:03,719
Yes, I did.

2298
01:34:03,788 --> 01:34:05,287
And what happened?

2299
01:34:06,724 --> 01:34:08,257
What do you think?

2300
01:34:08,326 --> 01:34:10,593
I... I think it's
still a great shot.

2301
01:34:10,662 --> 01:34:12,361
I... I think, uh,
it could still lead

2302
01:34:12,430 --> 01:34:14,764
to a lot of
things. Right?

2303
01:34:14,833 --> 01:34:17,199
This is a lousy
situation. I'm sorry,

2304
01:34:17,268 --> 01:34:19,535
but this is
a huge movie,

2305
01:34:19,604 --> 01:34:21,704
and it's a nice
part. It is.

2306
01:34:21,773 --> 01:34:23,238
Yeah, well...

2307
01:34:25,577 --> 01:34:27,042
So what
should I do?

2308
01:34:27,111 --> 01:34:28,778
Well, you read
the grandfather part.

2309
01:34:28,847 --> 01:34:31,347
I mean, we worked on it
3 days. You're ready.

2310
01:34:31,415 --> 01:34:32,582
What the hell
do you know?

2311
01:34:32,650 --> 01:34:33,883
Shut up.
Don't tell me.

2312
01:34:33,952 --> 01:34:35,751
Shut up.
Don't tell me.

2313
01:34:35,820 --> 01:34:37,419
Fell-fell-fellas.

2314
01:34:41,359 --> 01:34:42,692
Hurt them.

2315
01:34:54,606 --> 01:34:56,472
I'll do the
grandfather part,

2316
01:34:56,541 --> 01:34:59,241
'cause I know it, and,
uh, I'm already here.

2317
01:34:59,310 --> 01:35:00,442
Great.

2318
01:35:00,512 --> 01:35:02,712
All right.
So let's do it.

2319
01:35:05,449 --> 01:35:07,182
Could I do the scene
with the boyfriend?

2320
01:35:07,251 --> 01:35:10,052
You bet.
Whatever you want.

2321
01:35:10,121 --> 01:35:13,288
Karen, read the scene
with the boyfriend, please.

2322
01:35:14,392 --> 01:35:15,591
Can I stand up?

2323
01:35:15,660 --> 01:35:17,727
Sure.
Good. I'll sit here.

2324
01:35:22,767 --> 01:35:24,266
Are you ready?

2325
01:35:27,805 --> 01:35:28,838
Go.

2326
01:35:29,641 --> 01:35:31,073
"Mr. Tannenbaum,

2327
01:35:31,142 --> 01:35:33,042
"i have something
to tell you,

2328
01:35:33,110 --> 01:35:35,044
"and I'm a little
nervous about it."

2329
01:35:35,112 --> 01:35:36,913
"Stuey, what are
you nervous about?

2330
01:35:36,981 --> 01:35:38,280
"You're a good kid.

2331
01:35:38,349 --> 01:35:40,616
"My granddaughter
likes you. I like you.

2332
01:35:40,685 --> 01:35:42,585
"Come on,
talk to me."

2333
01:35:42,654 --> 01:35:44,687
"Ok. I...

2334
01:35:45,657 --> 01:35:47,222
"I got Julie pregnant."

2335
01:35:55,033 --> 01:35:56,699
"I'm really sorry."

2336
01:35:58,703 --> 01:36:01,003
"Stuey, go
into the kitchen.

2337
01:36:01,072 --> 01:36:02,237
"In the refrigerator,

2338
01:36:02,306 --> 01:36:03,739
"there's a bottle of wine

2339
01:36:03,808 --> 01:36:06,042
"that I've been saving
for a special occasion.

2340
01:36:06,110 --> 01:36:08,377
"Bring it here. Smash it
against that table,

2341
01:36:08,446 --> 01:36:12,582
"and with the jagged end,
ram it through my heart!

2342
01:36:12,650 --> 01:36:15,718
"I'd do it myself,
but I've got arthritis.

2343
01:36:15,787 --> 01:36:18,754
"Get out of my house,
you little sperm bank!

2344
01:36:18,823 --> 01:36:20,456
"I let you stay
here with me.

2345
01:36:20,524 --> 01:36:21,791
"I let you change
the channels

2346
01:36:21,859 --> 01:36:23,392
"in the middle
of what I'm watching.

2347
01:36:23,461 --> 01:36:25,394
"I let you have the
heel of the rye bread

2348
01:36:25,463 --> 01:36:28,497
"that I love so much.
I gave it to you, stuey."

2349
01:36:32,169 --> 01:36:33,836
Give him the line.

2350
01:36:37,675 --> 01:36:39,976
This is my part,
not the doctor.

2351
01:36:43,314 --> 01:36:44,513
Buddy...

2352
01:36:44,582 --> 01:36:45,915
I... I'm giving you
beauties here.

2353
01:36:45,984 --> 01:36:47,784
Don't you see?
I'm giving you beauties.

2354
01:36:47,852 --> 01:36:50,086
I mean, I know this part.
I know this guy.

2355
01:36:50,154 --> 01:36:51,687
Look, buddy,
I'm sorry.

2356
01:36:51,756 --> 01:36:54,223
I got every take, I got every
rhythm, whatever you need.

2357
01:36:54,291 --> 01:36:55,791
I'm like a museum
of comedy.

2358
01:36:55,860 --> 01:36:57,793
You want takes?
You go to the take exhibit.

2359
01:36:57,862 --> 01:36:59,862
You want faces? You go
to the face pavilion.

2360
01:36:59,931 --> 01:37:01,363
You want timing?
I'm a Swiss watch.

2361
01:37:01,432 --> 01:37:02,832
Buddy, calm down.
It's all right.

2362
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:04,100
Why should i
calm down?

2363
01:37:04,168 --> 01:37:06,902
It's a hit-and-run!
I got run over here!

2364
01:37:06,971 --> 01:37:09,772
I'm sorry. He's upset.
He gets a little upset.

2365
01:37:10,942 --> 01:37:14,376
Don't apologize for me,
Stan! I hate that!

2366
01:37:14,445 --> 01:37:17,146
Let's take a break, and then he'll...
He'll read the doctor.

2367
01:37:17,214 --> 01:37:19,849
I will not read
the doctor part!

2368
01:37:19,917 --> 01:37:21,550
This is my part!

2369
01:37:21,619 --> 01:37:22,885
Jesus Christ, Stan!

2370
01:37:22,954 --> 01:37:24,520
Anybody can shit
in your hat,

2371
01:37:24,588 --> 01:37:27,489
and you go, "thank you.
It fits much better now."

2372
01:37:27,558 --> 01:37:29,725
Well, I can't wear
that hat, Stan.

2373
01:37:29,794 --> 01:37:31,426
I'm takin' too many
punches here.

2374
01:37:31,495 --> 01:37:32,594
If my life
was a fight,

2375
01:37:32,664 --> 01:37:34,196
they would have
stopped it by now!

2376
01:37:34,265 --> 01:37:35,698
So I'm stoppin' it.
That's it.

2377
01:37:35,767 --> 01:37:37,166
I'm throwin' in
the towel.

2378
01:37:37,234 --> 01:37:38,668
Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!

2379
01:37:38,736 --> 01:37:41,603
The winner and still
champion... show business!

2380
01:37:41,673 --> 01:37:43,505
Annie, you're
a good girl

2381
01:37:43,574 --> 01:37:45,041
and a terrific agent.

2382
01:37:45,109 --> 01:37:46,776
Can I give you
a little advice?

2383
01:37:46,844 --> 01:37:48,544
Represent the living.

2384
01:37:51,348 --> 01:37:53,615
Larry,
no hard feelings.

2385
01:37:54,485 --> 01:37:55,885
Business is business,

2386
01:37:55,953 --> 01:37:56,953
prick.

2387
01:38:00,124 --> 01:38:01,757
Let's have lunch.

2388
01:38:06,330 --> 01:38:07,963
Um, I... I'll go
talk to him.

2389
01:38:08,032 --> 01:38:09,999
No... I'll do it.

2390
01:38:12,103 --> 01:38:14,463
He would have been
great in that part.

2391
01:38:21,512 --> 01:38:22,672
Ugh!

2392
01:38:24,548 --> 01:38:25,681
What are
you doin'?

2393
01:38:25,750 --> 01:38:27,249
You did it
to me again!

2394
01:38:27,318 --> 01:38:28,483
I was out of it,

2395
01:38:28,552 --> 01:38:30,019
and you sucked
me back in!

2396
01:38:30,088 --> 01:38:32,287
My grandson is
crying in Florida

2397
01:38:32,356 --> 01:38:35,057
so I could watch you
do that crap again!

2398
01:38:36,728 --> 01:38:38,493
I hurt my back here.

2399
01:38:38,562 --> 01:38:39,795
You happy?

2400
01:38:40,865 --> 01:38:42,064
My leg!

2401
01:38:43,134 --> 01:38:45,300
Come on,
help me up.

2402
01:38:45,369 --> 01:38:46,649
Please. Come on.

2403
01:38:48,773 --> 01:38:50,472
What are you, nuts?

2404
01:38:50,541 --> 01:38:52,981
Hittin' an old man
like that! You schmuck!

2405
01:38:53,010 --> 01:38:54,476
You're crazy.

2406
01:38:55,980 --> 01:38:57,179
You're nuts!

2407
01:38:57,248 --> 01:38:58,848
You stupid shit!

2408
01:39:08,359 --> 01:39:09,759
God, I hate you.

2409
01:39:09,827 --> 01:39:11,526
You're... you're
not a comedian.

2410
01:39:11,595 --> 01:39:12,828
You're a terrorist.

2411
01:39:12,897 --> 01:39:14,964
This time I was
right. They had...

2412
01:39:15,032 --> 01:39:17,466
You're
never right!

2413
01:39:17,534 --> 01:39:18,600
Even when
you're right,

2414
01:39:18,669 --> 01:39:20,202
you're not right!

2415
01:39:22,273 --> 01:39:24,706
Everybody gets
screwed, buddy!

2416
01:39:24,776 --> 01:39:27,009
Everybody
got shit upon,

2417
01:39:27,078 --> 01:39:28,177
got bad breaks!

2418
01:39:28,246 --> 01:39:30,246
That is part
of the business!

2419
01:39:30,314 --> 01:39:32,314
That is part of life!

2420
01:39:34,886 --> 01:39:37,086
You took every
bad break

2421
01:39:37,155 --> 01:39:38,155
you ever got,

2422
01:39:38,222 --> 01:39:40,489
and you made it worse.

2423
01:39:40,557 --> 01:39:43,592
You gotta burn
your Bridges behind you

2424
01:39:43,661 --> 01:39:44,994
and under you

2425
01:39:45,062 --> 01:39:46,461
and in front of you.

2426
01:39:46,530 --> 01:39:47,997
Every bridge!

2427
01:39:51,836 --> 01:39:53,135
Buddy, my whole life

2428
01:39:53,204 --> 01:39:54,569
I listened to
you bellyache

2429
01:39:54,638 --> 01:39:56,172
about your luck.

2430
01:39:57,275 --> 01:39:59,775
Well, you are
where you are

2431
01:39:59,844 --> 01:40:01,710
because of
who you are.

2432
01:40:26,437 --> 01:40:28,971
It should have been
you, right, Stan?

2433
01:40:30,374 --> 01:40:31,273
What?

2434
01:40:31,342 --> 01:40:32,674
Come on,
it's a lot of years.

2435
01:40:32,743 --> 01:40:35,277
Why don't we at least
say what it is?

2436
01:40:35,679 --> 01:40:37,179
Huh?

2437
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:39,982
It should have been you
instead of me, right?

2438
01:40:40,051 --> 01:40:41,283
You would have
been better,

2439
01:40:41,352 --> 01:40:42,918
you would have
handled things better.

2440
01:40:42,987 --> 01:40:44,386
You would have
made it all better

2441
01:40:44,455 --> 01:40:46,088
than I made
it, right?

2442
01:40:46,157 --> 01:40:47,622
You would have been
nicer to Elaine,

2443
01:40:47,691 --> 01:40:48,924
if she had liked
you that night

2444
01:40:48,993 --> 01:40:50,625
instead of me.

2445
01:40:52,230 --> 01:40:53,528
Come on, Stan,

2446
01:40:53,597 --> 01:40:54,796
you don't think I see

2447
01:40:54,866 --> 01:40:56,746
how you still
look at her?

2448
01:40:58,035 --> 01:40:59,434
You're sick.

2449
01:41:00,704 --> 01:41:02,404
No, it had to be
the way it was, Stan,

2450
01:41:02,473 --> 01:41:03,973
because you didn't
have the balls

2451
01:41:04,041 --> 01:41:05,774
to fight me for her.

2452
01:41:05,843 --> 01:41:07,576
You had living room
balls, Stan...

2453
01:41:07,644 --> 01:41:10,812
Funny in the living room,
but that's it.

2454
01:41:10,882 --> 01:41:12,547
And I know how it looked
to everybody...

2455
01:41:12,616 --> 01:41:14,316
"Oh, poor Stan.
What a nice guy.

2456
01:41:14,385 --> 01:41:16,551
"Has to put up with
crazy buddy, the shit.

2457
01:41:16,620 --> 01:41:18,754
"Why does he stay
with him?"

2458
01:41:18,822 --> 01:41:21,556
But we know why,
don't we, Stan, huh?

2459
01:41:23,327 --> 01:41:26,228
Because you had
to be around it,

2460
01:41:26,297 --> 01:41:27,329
near it,

2461
01:41:27,398 --> 01:41:28,430
so I let you

2462
01:41:28,499 --> 01:41:29,965
because
you're my brother

2463
01:41:30,034 --> 01:41:32,134
and you were brilliant,
and it broke my heart

2464
01:41:32,203 --> 01:41:34,703
that you never knew what
it felt like up there,

2465
01:41:34,772 --> 01:41:36,638
when it's good,
when it's cookin',

2466
01:41:36,707 --> 01:41:37,973
you got 'em,
they're yours,

2467
01:41:38,042 --> 01:41:39,541
you can take them
anywhere you want,

2468
01:41:39,610 --> 01:41:40,742
you're powerful,

2469
01:41:40,811 --> 01:41:42,344
you prowl the stage
like a panther,

2470
01:41:42,413 --> 01:41:43,478
it feels so good,

2471
01:41:43,547 --> 01:41:45,014
the laughs go right
into your blood.

2472
01:41:45,082 --> 01:41:46,748
You can be a schmuck
in the afternoon,

2473
01:41:46,817 --> 01:41:48,150
but you're the king
of the night.

2474
01:41:48,219 --> 01:41:49,651
And every woman
wants to fuck you,

2475
01:41:49,720 --> 01:41:51,320
and every man
wants to know you.

2476
01:41:51,389 --> 01:41:53,889
You never knew
that, Stan...

2477
01:41:53,958 --> 01:41:56,191
And I felt bad
for you,

2478
01:41:56,260 --> 01:41:57,960
and I wanted you
to at least

2479
01:41:58,029 --> 01:41:59,561
be close to it.

2480
01:42:00,932 --> 01:42:03,213
I didn't take
your life, Stan.

2481
01:42:04,068 --> 01:42:05,600
I gave you one.

2482
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:11,506
Yeah...

2483
01:42:11,575 --> 01:42:13,675
But you could have
been nicer.

2484
01:43:06,763 --> 01:43:08,830
Dad, what are you
doin' here?

2485
01:43:08,899 --> 01:43:09,931
Hi.

2486
01:43:10,701 --> 01:43:11,967
Did something
happen?

2487
01:43:12,036 --> 01:43:14,036
No, no, no, no.
Everything is ok.

2488
01:43:14,105 --> 01:43:16,805
I, uh, I just needed to
see you for a second.

2489
01:43:16,874 --> 01:43:20,109
That's all.

2490
01:43:20,177 --> 01:43:21,310
Oh.

2491
01:43:21,378 --> 01:43:23,878
Well, you want
to come in?

2492
01:43:23,947 --> 01:43:25,581
Uh, no. No, no.

2493
01:43:25,649 --> 01:43:27,449
This is...
This is ok.

2494
01:43:28,385 --> 01:43:30,252
It's ok.

2495
01:43:30,321 --> 01:43:32,354
Listen, do you have
a 21-inch color t.V.?

2496
01:43:32,423 --> 01:43:34,889
'Cause a guy just
carried one out of here.

2497
01:43:35,692 --> 01:43:37,692
No.

2498
01:43:37,761 --> 01:43:38,761
So, were
you shoppin'?

2499
01:43:38,829 --> 01:43:39,761
What?

2500
01:43:39,830 --> 01:43:40,996
Were you shoppin'?

2501
01:43:41,064 --> 01:43:43,698
Oh, I just picked up
a few things after work.

2502
01:43:43,767 --> 01:43:46,235
You're workin'. That's great.
Where you workin'?

2503
01:43:46,303 --> 01:43:48,503
I just...
Oh, it's nothing.

2504
01:43:49,006 --> 01:43:50,539
I...

2505
01:43:50,608 --> 01:43:51,973
Tell me,
where you workin'?

2506
01:43:52,042 --> 01:43:55,010
I got a job working
at a record company

2507
01:43:55,078 --> 01:43:56,612
in... in the publicity
department.

2508
01:43:56,680 --> 01:43:58,180
Yeah? Well,
that's good.

2509
01:43:58,249 --> 01:43:59,748
It's no big deal.

2510
01:43:59,816 --> 01:44:02,551
Oh, no, it is
a big deal.

2511
01:44:02,620 --> 01:44:05,787
It is. That's good.
That's a good thing.

2512
01:44:05,856 --> 01:44:06,976
Yeah.

2513
01:44:08,992 --> 01:44:11,152
And you look
healthy.

2514
01:44:16,233 --> 01:44:17,399
So...

2515
01:44:18,202 --> 01:44:19,701
What is it, dad?

2516
01:44:19,770 --> 01:44:21,403
Why are you here?

2517
01:44:22,540 --> 01:44:24,005
Yeah, well...

2518
01:44:25,709 --> 01:44:27,042
Grandma...

2519
01:44:29,313 --> 01:44:31,079
Left you some money.

2520
01:44:43,294 --> 01:44:45,394
$13,000?

2521
01:44:46,096 --> 01:44:48,430
Grandma had $13,000?

2522
01:44:48,499 --> 01:44:49,499
Yeah.

2523
01:44:49,533 --> 01:44:50,865
It was
probably more,

2524
01:44:50,934 --> 01:44:53,174
but that's all I could
get from her pimp.

2525
01:44:55,339 --> 01:44:57,138
Well, it's made
out to you.

2526
01:44:57,974 --> 01:44:59,774
Yeah, well...

2527
01:44:59,843 --> 01:45:02,283
When grandma made out
her will, years ago,

2528
01:45:03,046 --> 01:45:05,980
I was still the
executor of you...

2529
01:45:06,049 --> 01:45:08,449
You know, from when
you had your trouble, so...

2530
01:45:08,485 --> 01:45:10,885
So I endorsed it
right over there.

2531
01:45:13,457 --> 01:45:15,324
This will really help.

2532
01:45:17,661 --> 01:45:19,728
I can't believe
she did this.

2533
01:45:22,933 --> 01:45:24,700
Well, she loved you.

2534
01:45:29,172 --> 01:45:31,692
She always thought
the world of you...

2535
01:45:34,945 --> 01:45:37,679
And no matter what
was happening with you,

2536
01:45:37,748 --> 01:45:39,114
you know...

2537
01:45:40,951 --> 01:45:42,684
She...

2538
01:45:42,753 --> 01:45:44,786
She just loved you.

2539
01:45:50,361 --> 01:45:52,327
And like that,
you know?

2540
01:45:57,868 --> 01:45:58,900
Ok.

2541
01:45:59,836 --> 01:46:00,869
Ok.

2542
01:46:02,406 --> 01:46:03,438
Ok.

2543
01:46:05,276 --> 01:46:07,008
Call your mother, huh?

2544
01:46:08,145 --> 01:46:09,177
Ok.

2545
01:46:10,013 --> 01:46:11,045
Ok.

2546
01:46:14,050 --> 01:46:15,384
All right.

2547
01:46:29,866 --> 01:46:31,032
Susan.

2548
01:46:34,338 --> 01:46:35,837
Where's that
double take?

2549
01:46:38,809 --> 01:46:41,142
Come on, I'm goin'
on in a minute!

2550
01:46:54,591 --> 01:46:55,824
Perfect.

2551
01:47:21,819 --> 01:47:23,184
<i>So I come home,</i>

2552
01:47:23,253 --> 01:47:26,020
<i>I find my wife in bed
with my best friend,</i>

2553
01:47:26,089 --> 01:47:29,190
<i>so I said, "Lenny,
i have to, but you?"</i>

2554
01:47:31,228 --> 01:47:32,861
<i>I kid. I kid.</i>

2555
01:47:32,929 --> 01:47:34,363
<i>I'm kidding you all.</i>

2556
01:47:34,431 --> 01:47:36,398
<i>Guy goes into the
doctor's office, right?</i>

2557
01:47:36,467 --> 01:47:39,000
<i>He says,
"doc, I got 5 penises."</i>

2558
01:47:39,069 --> 01:47:41,269
<i>Right? Doc says,
"how do your pants fit?"</i>

2559
01:47:41,338 --> 01:47:43,572
<i>He says, "like a glove."</i>

2560
01:47:46,777 --> 01:47:48,042
<i>I got to tell you,</i>

2561
01:47:48,111 --> 01:47:50,044
<i>this is a great audience,
but these pants...</i>

2562
01:47:50,113 --> 01:47:52,046
<i>There's a pair
of pants here.</i>

2563
01:47:52,115 --> 01:47:54,075
<i>What is this,
let's-wear-anything day?</i>

2564
01:47:54,117 --> 01:47:55,216
<i>Have you seen this?</i>

2565
01:47:55,285 --> 01:47:57,051
<i>This man's
a walking garage sale.</i>

2566
01:47:57,120 --> 01:47:58,587
<i>Look at these pants.</i>

2567
01:47:58,655 --> 01:48:00,689
<i>You know what I'm sayin'?
What stinks?</i>

2568
01:48:00,758 --> 01:48:01,990
<i>Some... there's
a perfume here</i>

2569
01:48:02,058 --> 01:48:03,492
<i>that's... is
it you, ma'am?</i>

2570
01:48:03,560 --> 01:48:04,993
No.

2571
01:48:05,061 --> 01:48:07,128
<i>That eau de bayonne you're
wearin' there? But...</i>

2572
01:48:07,197 --> 01:48:08,730
<i>No, it's lovely makeup.</i>

2573
01:48:08,799 --> 01:48:12,300
<i>Who puts it on,
the ringling brothers?</i>

2574
01:48:12,369 --> 01:48:14,736
<i>Looks like an opera
broke out on your face.</i>

2575
01:48:14,805 --> 01:48:17,372
<i>You got too close when
the avon lady exploded.</i>

2576
01:48:19,610 --> 01:48:23,378
<i>But there's a guy over here
that I can't believe.</i>

2577
01:48:23,447 --> 01:48:25,781
<i>I mean this in
the nicest of terms.</i>

2578
01:48:25,849 --> 01:48:27,248
<i>Is that a toupee?</i>

2579
01:48:27,317 --> 01:48:28,317
No.

2580
01:48:28,385 --> 01:48:30,719
<i>No. Well, I, for
one, was fooled.</i>

2581
01:48:36,727 --> 01:48:37,926
<i>Looks like
somebody stapled</i>

2582
01:48:37,994 --> 01:48:40,028
<i>a Danish to your
head, you know?</i>

2583
01:48:53,410 --> 01:48:54,509
Yeah?

2584
01:49:01,251 --> 01:49:02,417
Hello, buddy.

2585
01:49:03,219 --> 01:49:04,619
Hello, Stan.

2586
01:49:08,391 --> 01:49:09,491
How are you?

2587
01:49:10,527 --> 01:49:12,928
It was a good show.

2588
01:49:12,996 --> 01:49:14,763
Yeah,
they were good.

2589
01:49:14,832 --> 01:49:17,031
No, you were...
You were really sharp.

2590
01:49:17,100 --> 01:49:18,633
Everything was
right on the beat.

2591
01:49:19,436 --> 01:49:21,302
Well, it...
It felt good.

2592
01:49:21,371 --> 01:49:23,338
You know, i-I've been
playing these places,

2593
01:49:23,406 --> 01:49:24,873
and, uh,
it's been ok.

2594
01:49:24,942 --> 01:49:27,108
Yeah, I saw in the paper
that you were here.

2595
01:49:27,177 --> 01:49:28,443
Oh, yeah?

2596
01:49:29,680 --> 01:49:31,112
Did you see Elaine?

2597
01:49:31,181 --> 01:49:32,447
Yeah.

2598
01:49:32,516 --> 01:49:34,148
You know, usually, she
don't like the... the clubs

2599
01:49:34,217 --> 01:49:35,817
and the traveling
and, uh...

2600
01:49:35,886 --> 01:49:37,686
But it's nice
that you're together.

2601
01:49:37,754 --> 01:49:38,754
Yeah...

2602
01:49:39,490 --> 01:49:40,589
Yeah.

2603
01:49:42,225 --> 01:49:44,192
And what's this?

2604
01:49:44,260 --> 01:49:45,794
Oh, this is, uh...

2605
01:49:45,863 --> 01:49:47,228
A painting that I did.

2606
01:49:47,297 --> 01:49:48,497
Really?

2607
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:51,399
Here. It's for you.

2608
01:49:52,402 --> 01:49:53,802
It's for me?

2609
01:49:56,106 --> 01:49:57,572
Thanks, Stan.

2610
01:49:59,342 --> 01:50:00,509
Should i
open it now?

2611
01:50:00,577 --> 01:50:01,510
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.

2612
01:50:01,578 --> 01:50:03,378
Yeah?
Go ahead.

2613
01:50:24,100 --> 01:50:25,433
It's good.

2614
01:50:28,005 --> 01:50:29,538
It's very good.

2615
01:50:31,842 --> 01:50:33,808
Nah, you know,
it's just a...

2616
01:50:33,877 --> 01:50:35,209
Thing I...

2617
01:51:02,138 --> 01:51:04,873
Is that the only jacket
that you brought?

2618
01:51:06,509 --> 01:51:07,842
Yeah. Why?

2619
01:51:09,880 --> 01:51:12,380
Because the other
jacket was funnier.

2620
01:51:16,086 --> 01:51:18,853
You know, I got
to tell you, Stan,

2621
01:51:18,922 --> 01:51:22,190
seeing you walk into the
back of that room today...

2622
01:51:24,061 --> 01:51:26,027
It just made me feel...

2623
01:51:27,430 --> 01:51:29,197
Sick to my stomach.

2624
01:51:29,265 --> 01:51:32,333
I thought I'd lose my lunch
right on the stage.

2625
01:51:35,338 --> 01:51:38,339
Did you see
what I did there?

2626
01:51:38,408 --> 01:51:40,709
You thought
i was gonna say...

2627
01:51:40,777 --> 01:51:43,478
That I was overjoyed
to see you again...

2628
01:51:44,881 --> 01:51:47,015
But I took you
the other way.

2629
01:51:51,121 --> 01:51:52,286
I saw.

2630
01:51:56,059 --> 01:51:58,994
But you said you, uh,
you liked the act, huh?

2631
01:51:59,062 --> 01:52:00,662
Yeah, yeah.

2632
01:52:00,731 --> 01:52:02,430
You know what was
really good

2633
01:52:02,499 --> 01:52:04,799
was, uh, the
ringling brothers.

2634
01:52:04,868 --> 01:52:06,367
Oh, yeah, well,
that occurred to me

2635
01:52:06,436 --> 01:52:07,568
right on stage.

2636
01:52:07,638 --> 01:52:08,670
What, right then?

2637
01:52:08,739 --> 01:52:10,539
Oh, yeah. I went with it
right then and there.

2638
01:52:10,607 --> 01:52:11,906
Well, it was very funny.

2639
01:52:11,975 --> 01:52:14,009
Oh, yeah, you know,
i always used to say "circus",

2640
01:52:14,077 --> 01:52:15,409
but I went
more specific.

2641
01:52:15,478 --> 01:52:16,645
Well, it was
very funny.

2642
01:52:16,713 --> 01:52:18,079
It was better, right?
Don't you think?

2643
01:52:18,148 --> 01:52:19,080
Much better.

2644
01:52:19,149 --> 01:52:20,581
Yeah, I loved it.
Hi, honey.

2645
01:52:20,651 --> 01:52:22,183
Then I rolled over
to that other guy.

2646
01:52:22,252 --> 01:52:24,218
Oh, what, the guy with the...
With the toupee?

2647
01:52:24,287 --> 01:52:25,319
Well, you're
being kind.

2648
01:52:25,388 --> 01:52:26,587
I, for one,
was fooled.

2649
01:52:26,657 --> 01:52:28,690
He looked like
an old q-tip,

2650
01:52:28,759 --> 01:52:29,991
this guy.

2651
01:52:30,060 --> 01:52:32,060
W-w-well, I...
I just hammered that.

2652
01:52:32,129 --> 01:52:33,227
You know, I mean,
i had to.

2653
01:52:33,296 --> 01:52:35,136
But... but it was
good-natured.

2654
01:52:35,198 --> 01:52:36,597
It was good-natured
hammering.

2655
01:52:36,667 --> 01:52:37,667
They loved it.

2656
01:52:37,701 --> 01:52:39,100
They loved you, honey.

2657
01:52:39,169 --> 01:52:40,735
They had a great
sense of humor.

2658
01:52:40,804 --> 01:52:42,170
And they had
a good time.

2659
01:52:42,238 --> 01:52:43,738
Oh, sure.

2660
01:52:43,807 --> 01:52:46,074
Well, what I was doing,
forget about it.

2661
01:52:46,143 --> 01:52:47,175
Cannon shots.

2662
01:52:47,243 --> 01:52:48,743
Yeah, but one
after another.

2663
01:52:48,812 --> 01:52:49,644
Wow.

2664
01:52:49,713 --> 01:52:50,845
It wasn't even fair.

2665
01:52:50,914 --> 01:52:52,313
It wasn't fair.

2666
01:52:52,382 --> 01:52:53,682
You know?
I had a good time.

2667
01:52:53,750 --> 01:52:56,017
I thought it was strong.
I felt vital,

2668
01:52:56,086 --> 01:52:57,518
and I did 48 minutes.

2669
01:52:57,587 --> 01:52:59,620
It takes me
that long to pee.

2670
01:52:59,690 --> 01:53:01,622
Did you write
any of this down?

2671
01:53:01,692 --> 01:53:02,991
I didn't bring
a pad.

2672
01:53:03,060 --> 01:53:04,225
