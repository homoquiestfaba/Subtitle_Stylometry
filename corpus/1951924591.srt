0
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:27,749
It was a storm of judgement.

1
00:00:53,036 --> 00:00:55,948
Foryears we had been hiding
from repression.

2
00:00:58,556 --> 00:01:00,831
Hiding from Napolean's spies.

3
00:01:12,076 --> 00:01:13,589
But now, nature

4
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:16,107
was washing away the disease.

5
00:01:21,156 --> 00:01:23,716
I always knew, as with

6
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:26,305
all things built
on the wrong foundations,

7
00:01:26,756 --> 00:01:28,986
the farmwould one day crumble.

8
00:01:29,716 --> 00:01:31,195
At last the wait was over.

9
00:01:33,956 --> 00:01:36,026
The poisonous cement
which held Napolean's

10
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:39,393
evil dream together
was beingwashed away.

11
00:01:42,156 --> 00:01:44,112
I could taste it in the water.

12
00:01:50,156 --> 00:01:51,145
I was old.

13
00:01:51,476 --> 00:01:52,909
I was almost blind.

14
00:01:53,716 --> 00:01:55,274
But I could still remember.

15
00:02:07,636 --> 00:02:10,753
It startedwith the day
the Pilkingtons returned Mollie.

16
00:02:14,276 --> 00:02:17,074
Old Major, the prize boar,

17
00:02:17,356 --> 00:02:21,110
had had a dream and the other pigs
had called ameeting in the barn.

18
00:02:37,756 --> 00:02:40,395
- Now boys. Not too much.
- Hush up, woman.

19
00:02:40,596 --> 00:02:43,588
- They shouldn't do that.
- They're having fun, now hush up.

20
00:02:43,996 --> 00:02:46,305
Yes, we're only playing, Ma.

21
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:50,868
And one day, the pigs might come
and playwith you.

22
00:02:51,036 --> 00:02:52,708
There you go again,
talking rubbish.

23
00:02:52,956 --> 00:02:54,912
They're only dumb animals, God.

24
00:02:58,556 --> 00:03:02,105
Boxer! Boxer!
Keep straight!

25
00:03:03,036 --> 00:03:05,152
Look where you're going, Boxer!

26
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,272
Keep aline, keep aline.

27
00:03:13,596 --> 00:03:14,949
Fool of ahorse going

28
00:03:15,156 --> 00:03:16,032
the wrongway.

29
00:03:21,796 --> 00:03:24,435
Boxer! Boxer!

30
00:03:28,196 --> 00:03:29,345
What the?

31
00:03:32,276 --> 00:03:34,915
Whoa, Mollie, whoa there.
Whoa...

32
00:03:35,156 --> 00:03:36,225
Whoa, whoa.

33
00:03:38,276 --> 00:03:39,709
Jones, you old drunkard.

34
00:03:39,956 --> 00:03:42,834
Mr. Pilkington.
Mrs... Nice hat.

35
00:03:43,836 --> 00:03:44,951
We've brought your horse back.

36
00:03:45,596 --> 00:03:46,506
Thanks.

37
00:03:46,676 --> 00:03:47,950
All right, was she?
Mollie...

38
00:03:48,156 --> 00:03:49,555
Yes, she did the job.
Where do you want her?

39
00:03:51,036 --> 00:03:53,186
There's ameeting tonight
in the barn.

40
00:03:53,716 --> 00:03:55,354
Okay, Jessie.
I'll be there.

41
00:03:56,196 --> 00:03:58,949
- Is kind ofyou to invite us.
- Is nothing special.

42
00:03:59,116 --> 00:04:00,708
Just a few neighbors over
for a drink.

43
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:03,828
Well, we wouldn't want to miss out
on this generosity,

44
00:04:04,156 --> 00:04:05,111
wouldwe?

45
00:04:06,556 --> 00:04:09,150
- Look, Mr. P, about your money...
- My dear boy.

46
00:04:09,996 --> 00:04:13,306
We'll speak tonight.
Hey, walk on.

47
00:04:14,156 --> 00:04:15,384
Bye bye, Jessie.

48
00:04:15,596 --> 00:04:18,269
- I hate him. He smells.
- Oh, do be quiet.

49
00:04:19,196 --> 00:04:20,914
Come on, Mollie. Come on!

50
00:04:22,636 --> 00:04:25,434
That man has loserwritten
all over his face.

51
00:04:25,996 --> 00:04:27,668
I don't think
he can take much more.

52
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:31,309
- I thought he was your friend.
- My friend?

53
00:04:32,876 --> 00:04:34,673
How verylittle you know
of the world.

54
00:04:52,196 --> 00:04:55,393
Come on, Boxer.
Walk on and keep aline.

55
00:04:56,716 --> 00:04:57,944
Keep aline, damn you.

56
00:04:59,036 --> 00:05:01,027
Go on, step in, Boxer.

57
00:05:02,396 --> 00:05:03,351
Boxer!

58
00:05:03,516 --> 00:05:06,826
Boxer, look what
you've done to me field.

59
00:05:07,036 --> 00:05:09,106
You stupid lump of dog flesh.
You're dog meat.

60
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:10,709
You're a dead horse, Boxer.

61
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:12,634
You're for the glue factory.

62
00:05:13,356 --> 00:05:14,425
I'll strangle you
with my own hands.

63
00:05:17,756 --> 00:05:19,314
Whas going on?

64
00:05:19,716 --> 00:05:21,069
Leave him be.

65
00:05:21,636 --> 00:05:22,625
Leave him be.

66
00:05:25,556 --> 00:05:27,069
Thou shalt not kill.

67
00:05:27,356 --> 00:05:28,675
He was hurting Boxer.

68
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:31,312
No animal can ever
attack ahuman.

69
00:05:31,556 --> 00:05:33,308
No human should ever
hurt an animal.

70
00:05:33,516 --> 00:05:35,234
Jones!

71
00:05:35,556 --> 00:05:37,512
Where are you?

72
00:05:38,276 --> 00:05:40,028
Jessie, Jessie!

73
00:05:40,396 --> 00:05:41,590
Go, quick.

74
00:05:42,436 --> 00:05:43,994
I've got a train to catch.

75
00:05:44,196 --> 00:05:46,949
Quick, she's coming, quick.

76
00:05:52,596 --> 00:05:55,110
Wake up, you drunken pig.

77
00:06:02,636 --> 00:06:05,867
We're now late and the car
probablywon't start anyway.

78
00:06:08,676 --> 00:06:12,385
You saidyou'd get it fixed.
Now please don't get drunk.

79
00:06:12,556 --> 00:06:13,955
There's a clean tablecloth
in the cupboard.

80
00:06:14,156 --> 00:06:18,274
Don't wear those boots. Don't call
me at my sisters, she hates you.

81
00:06:21,396 --> 00:06:23,432
Hey, come on girls.

82
00:06:23,796 --> 00:06:25,024
You're supposed to be
at the meeting.

83
00:06:25,276 --> 00:06:26,186
Come on.

84
00:06:26,796 --> 00:06:27,706
Follow me.

85
00:06:32,516 --> 00:06:33,710
And the sink is blocked

86
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:35,713
and the butchery's full of flies.

87
00:06:36,076 --> 00:06:38,590
Make sure you get Pilkington
to lendyou more money.

88
00:07:32,356 --> 00:07:33,232
Animals...

89
00:07:33,516 --> 00:07:37,395
The wisest ofus all has words
which must now be spoken.

90
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,555
These words came to Old Major
in a dream

91
00:07:40,716 --> 00:07:42,627
and must now be heard.

92
00:07:43,316 --> 00:07:44,465
My friends...

93
00:07:45,596 --> 00:07:48,349
I do not think I will be with you

94
00:07:48,756 --> 00:07:51,634
for many days more.

95
00:07:52,796 --> 00:07:54,866
I have had along life.

96
00:07:55,556 --> 00:07:58,866
And now it is my duty
to pass on to you

97
00:07:59,716 --> 00:08:01,786
such as I understand

98
00:08:02,196 --> 00:08:04,391
of the nature of our lives.

99
00:08:05,596 --> 00:08:08,269
Animalkind is born to amiserable,

100
00:08:08,636 --> 00:08:12,424
laborious, and short existence.

101
00:08:13,356 --> 00:08:14,675
We are given

102
00:08:14,996 --> 00:08:19,148
only just enough food as will
sustain the breath in our bodies

103
00:08:19,356 --> 00:08:21,028
for the work we do,

104
00:08:21,956 --> 00:08:25,232
andwhen our usefulness
has come to an end,

105
00:08:25,876 --> 00:08:27,707
we are slaughtered

106
00:08:28,236 --> 00:08:30,704
with hideous cruelty.

107
00:08:31,036 --> 00:08:32,355
- No!
- No!

108
00:08:34,396 --> 00:08:35,351
Yes.

109
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:39,829
Andwho prayis responsible
for our suffering?

110
00:08:44,036 --> 00:08:45,264
Man!

111
00:08:46,196 --> 00:08:48,994
Man is our enemy.

112
00:08:55,196 --> 00:08:56,311
Mr. P?

113
00:08:57,716 --> 00:08:58,990
Oh, not too much now.

114
00:08:59,756 --> 00:09:00,905
Must be trying
to sweeten me up, eh?

115
00:09:02,396 --> 00:09:04,193
Mr. P, about the moneyl owe you...

116
00:09:04,356 --> 00:09:06,631
My dear boy, we're just having
a friendly drink.

117
00:09:07,196 --> 00:09:08,709
Don't want to spoil the occasion,
do we?

118
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:12,829
The bank is on me, Mr. P. I don't
know what to do. I'm desperate.

119
00:09:13,436 --> 00:09:14,425
Well...

120
00:09:14,796 --> 00:09:17,629
You can always just sign the farm
over to me and have done with it.

121
00:09:20,436 --> 00:09:21,471
Mr. Frederick.

122
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,751
I'm sure Mr. Pwillwork
something out foryou.

123
00:09:29,356 --> 00:09:31,108
Mrs. Jones not about this evening?

124
00:09:31,316 --> 00:09:33,352
No, she's gone to her sister's
on the train.

125
00:09:41,196 --> 00:09:43,152
Remove man,

126
00:09:43,356 --> 00:09:47,190
and the root cause
ofhunger and overwork

127
00:09:47,356 --> 00:09:49,790
is abolished forever.

128
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:52,353
Remove man,

129
00:09:52,956 --> 00:09:54,355
and the produce of our labor

130
00:09:54,836 --> 00:09:56,554
will be our own.

131
00:09:57,556 --> 00:10:00,673
Remove man, and overnight

132
00:10:01,076 --> 00:10:02,555
we will become

133
00:10:03,316 --> 00:10:06,194
free and equal.

134
00:10:06,556 --> 00:10:07,909
Free and equal.

135
00:10:08,476 --> 00:10:10,353
Free and equal.

136
00:10:10,996 --> 00:10:13,226
- Free and equal.
- I thought I was free.

137
00:10:13,836 --> 00:10:16,669
- Will it mean no harnesses?
- You believe that,

138
00:10:16,876 --> 00:10:18,707
you'll believe anything.

139
00:10:19,116 --> 00:10:23,029
We must never come to resemble man
in anyway.

140
00:10:23,396 --> 00:10:26,786
If there are no humans,
who will brush mymane?

141
00:10:26,996 --> 00:10:28,395
Oh, no.

142
00:10:28,556 --> 00:10:30,194
Andwho will braid it
with ribbons?

143
00:10:30,876 --> 00:10:32,355
Did I hear someone sayribbons?

144
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:34,707
I can get ribbons,
I can get anything.

145
00:10:35,356 --> 00:10:36,550
What you got to trade?

146
00:10:36,956 --> 00:10:38,150
You shouldn't care about

147
00:10:38,356 --> 00:10:40,028
looking pretty for humans.

148
00:10:40,196 --> 00:10:42,312
But I like looking pretty
for humans.

149
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:44,347
...or engage in trade!

150
00:10:44,636 --> 00:10:46,308
What? No trade?

151
00:10:46,796 --> 00:10:49,868
Amongst us animals there must be

152
00:10:50,636 --> 00:10:53,104
unity and comradeship.

153
00:10:53,716 --> 00:10:56,833
All animals are friends.

154
00:10:57,876 --> 00:11:02,472
All humans are enemies.

155
00:11:25,556 --> 00:11:26,466
We'll have to

156
00:11:26,676 --> 00:11:28,234
stay over, Mr.J.

157
00:11:32,476 --> 00:11:33,750
Help me up, then.

158
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:39,145
Oh, beg your pardon.

159
00:11:41,756 --> 00:11:43,235
Second door on the left.

160
00:11:54,316 --> 00:11:57,706
Pilkington, we've got to talk now.

161
00:11:58,276 --> 00:11:59,231
Wake up.

162
00:12:01,156 --> 00:12:04,034
I can't pay you.
You've got to give me more time.

163
00:12:04,756 --> 00:12:08,385
In fact, ifyou could see yourway
to lending me another hundred or so,

164
00:12:08,596 --> 00:12:11,588
just for amonth.
Pilkington.

165
00:12:12,756 --> 00:12:15,145
I needyou help.

166
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:17,425
Wake up,

167
00:12:18,276 --> 00:12:21,791
you fat money-grabbing pig.

168
00:12:39,436 --> 00:12:40,346
Oh, no.

169
00:12:41,196 --> 00:12:43,505
Mrs. P, you've got the wrong room.

170
00:12:43,956 --> 00:12:45,548
No I haven't, my dear.

171
00:12:48,636 --> 00:12:49,546
Don't worry.

172
00:12:50,156 --> 00:12:51,555
He'll be out for the night.

173
00:12:55,836 --> 00:12:57,349
Now, my friends,

174
00:12:57,676 --> 00:13:01,715
I will tellyou about
the end ofmy dream

175
00:13:02,676 --> 00:13:04,951
and the song that came to me.

176
00:13:05,476 --> 00:13:07,671
Is a song you must learn.

177
00:13:08,076 --> 00:13:12,035
Is a song ofjustice and freedom.

178
00:13:13,476 --> 00:13:16,309
Beasts of the world,
we shall unite.

179
00:13:16,836 --> 00:13:20,192
Rise up and ready for the fight.

180
00:13:21,036 --> 00:13:24,346
Soon or late that daywill be,

181
00:13:24,556 --> 00:13:27,866
when man's defeated
andwe are free.

182
00:13:28,716 --> 00:13:31,708
Soon or late that daywill be,

183
00:13:32,196 --> 00:13:35,745
when man's defeated
andwe are free.

184
00:13:41,276 --> 00:13:42,755
Mr. J...

185
00:13:47,476 --> 00:13:50,707
Our limbs be tired andworn,

186
00:13:51,356 --> 00:13:54,712
our dreams will not be broken.

187
00:13:54,996 --> 00:13:58,068
Our hearts will not be torn,

188
00:13:58,876 --> 00:14:02,312
our dreams will not be broken.

189
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:05,947
Our hearts will not be torn...

190
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:17,711
Whas going on now?

191
00:14:25,796 --> 00:14:27,149
Blasted coat.

192
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,634
Getting aman out ofhis sleep.

193
00:14:58,716 --> 00:15:00,308
Damn foxes.

194
00:15:10,156 --> 00:15:11,066
Old Major

195
00:15:11,276 --> 00:15:12,152
had been hit.

196
00:15:12,876 --> 00:15:15,071
Was our revolution over
before it had begun?

197
00:15:16,076 --> 00:15:16,747
No!

198
00:15:19,396 --> 00:15:20,624
No, Major. No.

199
00:16:06,036 --> 00:16:08,675
There are no rewards after death.

200
00:16:09,276 --> 00:16:11,107
There is only the here and now.

201
00:16:11,956 --> 00:16:14,629
We must work to make
this life better.

202
00:16:15,076 --> 00:16:17,510
Friends, we must always remember

203
00:16:17,716 --> 00:16:20,276
that Old Major died
for every one ofus.

204
00:16:20,836 --> 00:16:23,794
And now we each have a duty to him.

205
00:16:24,876 --> 00:16:26,594
Revolution!

206
00:16:42,956 --> 00:16:44,674
Must need feeding again.

207
00:16:57,556 --> 00:17:00,548
Jessie!
Jessie, come on girl!

208
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:04,871
Come on, girl.
Here.

209
00:17:05,636 --> 00:17:07,592
Take it. Here.

210
00:17:08,156 --> 00:17:09,032
Come on.

211
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:11,706
Hello?

212
00:17:13,196 --> 00:17:14,311
Whas the matter, girl?

213
00:17:14,676 --> 00:17:15,586
You don't like it?

214
00:17:48,876 --> 00:17:52,869
Lfyou paid attention to the farm,
we wouldn't have money troubles.

215
00:18:03,196 --> 00:18:04,072
Where you going?

216
00:18:05,996 --> 00:18:07,793
The animals need feeding.

217
00:18:28,276 --> 00:18:29,186
Dennis...

218
00:18:29,556 --> 00:18:31,626
- Eric... drink?
- Yeah, come on.

219
00:18:31,836 --> 00:18:33,872
We haven't fed or milked
them yet, Mr. Jones.

220
00:18:34,076 --> 00:18:35,668
We'll do it later.
I need apint.

221
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:38,666
We need milking.

222
00:18:42,356 --> 00:18:44,995
Stupid dogwants apint, too.

223
00:18:45,596 --> 00:18:46,824
Well, if she's got anymoney,

224
00:18:47,076 --> 00:18:48,031
she can have one.

225
00:18:48,476 --> 00:18:49,829
I'm veryhungry.

226
00:18:50,676 --> 00:18:52,712
You'lljust have to wait.

227
00:19:07,556 --> 00:19:09,308
At last.

228
00:19:16,516 --> 00:19:18,188
Will he feed us now?

229
00:19:20,436 --> 00:19:22,745
Mr. Jones...
What about the animals?

230
00:19:25,156 --> 00:19:27,033
Ah, let them rot.
Come on, lads. Les get

231
00:19:27,316 --> 00:19:28,192
another drink.

232
00:19:30,476 --> 00:19:32,148
I need food.

233
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:48,384
Les go.
Is in the food store.

234
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:51,705
- Quiet.
- Boxer...

235
00:19:52,076 --> 00:19:53,225
We can help ourselves.

236
00:19:57,356 --> 00:19:58,186
Come on.

237
00:20:05,036 --> 00:20:06,469
Come on, follow me.

238
00:20:45,076 --> 00:20:45,986
Wait.

239
00:20:46,156 --> 00:20:48,067
Do you mind?
I'm trying to have my dinner.

240
00:20:48,276 --> 00:20:49,186
Thas mine.

241
00:20:49,396 --> 00:20:50,545
I was saving that.

242
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:51,871
Leave now.

243
00:20:58,236 --> 00:20:59,112
Boxer.

244
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,793
Boxer, Boxer.

245
00:21:03,316 --> 00:21:05,147
The humans are coming.

246
00:21:33,156 --> 00:21:34,669
Whas going on in there?

247
00:21:46,956 --> 00:21:48,230
Come on, les get them.

248
00:22:19,356 --> 00:22:21,551
Don't give them time to regroup.

249
00:22:23,716 --> 00:22:25,468
Seize the day.

250
00:22:26,156 --> 00:22:27,509
Get in the car!

251
00:23:05,156 --> 00:23:06,271
Wait for me.

252
00:23:19,636 --> 00:23:22,070
Quick, come on. Get inside.

253
00:23:22,876 --> 00:23:24,514
Move it, come on.

254
00:23:28,036 --> 00:23:29,992
Victoryis ours.

255
00:23:40,436 --> 00:23:42,996
- What do we do now?
- Wait and see.

256
00:23:45,556 --> 00:23:47,547
This is an outrage.

257
00:23:48,716 --> 00:23:49,626
On my farm,

258
00:23:50,116 --> 00:23:51,265
the animals know their place.

259
00:23:51,476 --> 00:23:53,944
Know their place?
Of course theyknow their place.

260
00:23:54,556 --> 00:23:56,945
- They're animals.
- What am I going to do?

261
00:23:58,796 --> 00:24:00,866
My dear boy, you're homeless.

262
00:24:01,676 --> 00:24:04,554
You've got no money.
The treatment ofyour animals

263
00:24:04,956 --> 00:24:07,106
has led them to seizing power,

264
00:24:07,436 --> 00:24:10,428
an uprisingwhich could easily
spread to all our farms.

265
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:14,304
You've done enough.

266
00:24:18,236 --> 00:24:19,146
Shut up!

267
00:24:23,276 --> 00:24:24,391
I'm thinking.

268
00:24:28,476 --> 00:24:30,432
- Oh, no.
- They've come to kill us.

269
00:24:30,996 --> 00:24:32,270
Do something, Mr. P.

270
00:24:38,916 --> 00:24:39,792
Shoo.

271
00:24:46,076 --> 00:24:49,307
And so at last
the farm belonged to us,

272
00:24:49,756 --> 00:24:51,030
andwe were free.

273
00:24:51,796 --> 00:24:54,151
We now knew we could live
without fear.

274
00:24:55,556 --> 00:24:58,116
And Snowballwould show us the way.

275
00:25:07,556 --> 00:25:08,466
Can you read?

276
00:25:09,756 --> 00:25:12,145
Not yet, but I will learn.

277
00:25:12,836 --> 00:25:13,951
Thas good.

278
00:25:15,156 --> 00:25:18,114
Snowball,
the cows are in great pain.

279
00:25:18,756 --> 00:25:19,666
Theyneed milking.

280
00:25:20,196 --> 00:25:23,188
Well, I could try.

281
00:25:24,036 --> 00:25:25,867
All right now, just hold still.

282
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:34,068
Oh, Lord. Oh, right.
I just need practice.

283
00:25:37,476 --> 00:25:38,989
Can you see anything?

284
00:25:40,076 --> 00:25:43,432
Of course I can't see.
I don't have the eyesight, do I?

285
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:48,145
Well, can you smell anything?

286
00:25:49,236 --> 00:25:51,033
What? Other than you?

287
00:25:51,796 --> 00:25:52,785
Hey, get off!

288
00:25:57,076 --> 00:25:58,907
There's Snowball andJessie.

289
00:26:01,556 --> 00:26:02,989
Oh, I'm sorry.

290
00:26:03,516 --> 00:26:05,154
Hello, Jessie.

291
00:26:06,116 --> 00:26:07,868
Whas he doing up there?

292
00:26:08,596 --> 00:26:12,430
Come here, come and look.
See, I have aglorious surprise.

293
00:26:14,116 --> 00:26:15,390
What are you doing?

294
00:26:16,756 --> 00:26:18,235
Well, what does it say?

295
00:26:18,756 --> 00:26:20,235
Thas the farm's name.

296
00:26:20,676 --> 00:26:22,712
And as the farm now belongs to us,

297
00:26:23,236 --> 00:26:24,351
what words have I painted?

298
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:27,474
- Us farm?
- Animal Farm.

299
00:26:28,636 --> 00:26:29,864
Animal Farm.

300
00:26:34,756 --> 00:26:35,666
Well...

301
00:26:35,876 --> 00:26:38,515
lfyou can write,
you must be able to read.

302
00:26:38,796 --> 00:26:41,674
Yes, we pigs have taught ourselves
to read andwrite.

303
00:26:42,996 --> 00:26:44,190
What is it?

304
00:26:45,356 --> 00:26:46,948
I think is my time.

305
00:26:47,156 --> 00:26:48,066
You're dying?

306
00:26:48,276 --> 00:26:49,550
No. Puppies.

307
00:26:49,876 --> 00:26:50,865
Puppies...

308
00:26:51,156 --> 00:26:54,865
- Puppies. Quick, what do we do?
- Steadynow, Boxer.

309
00:26:55,636 --> 00:26:57,433
Les getJessie back to the barn.

310
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:00,946
Boxer!

311
00:27:01,196 --> 00:27:05,109
Boxer, where are you?
Come on, we're waiting.

312
00:27:05,796 --> 00:27:07,593
Are you sure you're okay?

313
00:27:07,996 --> 00:27:10,590
Boxer, go with the others.
I'll be fine.

314
00:27:12,476 --> 00:27:13,670
Lfyou're sure...

315
00:27:13,916 --> 00:27:15,634
I'm sure.

316
00:27:15,836 --> 00:27:16,951
Here by the house.

317
00:27:56,956 --> 00:27:57,832
Whas that?

318
00:27:58,956 --> 00:28:01,595
Is abox where
humans watch humans.

319
00:28:04,756 --> 00:28:06,075
Keeps them quiet.

320
00:28:06,276 --> 00:28:07,470
Could be useful.

321
00:28:09,076 --> 00:28:09,986
Animals,

322
00:28:10,276 --> 00:28:11,914
I propose that the farmhouse
never be used,

323
00:28:12,076 --> 00:28:13,748
but preserved as amuzeum.

324
00:28:14,196 --> 00:28:15,549
All those in favor?

325
00:28:21,596 --> 00:28:22,506
Carried.

326
00:28:29,956 --> 00:28:32,186
Les see how the humans lived.

327
00:28:34,116 --> 00:28:38,075
They steeped themselves in luxury
while we lived in

328
00:28:38,276 --> 00:28:39,595
squalor.

329
00:28:42,676 --> 00:28:44,189
A horsehair chair.

330
00:28:44,436 --> 00:28:48,315
Animals have to die
for humans to sit in comfort.

331
00:28:52,636 --> 00:28:56,424
And this bed, filledwith
feathers plucked from animals.

332
00:29:20,756 --> 00:29:21,984
Oh, heaven's sake.

333
00:29:27,996 --> 00:29:29,714
We must bury them all.

334
00:29:45,276 --> 00:29:46,186
Compatriots.

335
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:48,230
Over here.

336
00:29:54,636 --> 00:29:55,705
We must work quickly.

337
00:29:56,076 --> 00:29:58,112
Tell Pincher to meet me
in the harness room.

338
00:29:59,556 --> 00:30:01,194
This might be aproblem.

339
00:30:13,756 --> 00:30:14,666
These...

340
00:30:14,916 --> 00:30:17,066
are Old Major's thoughts,
the principals

341
00:30:17,396 --> 00:30:19,193
of Animalism. We must

342
00:30:19,516 --> 00:30:21,905
always remember
what he taught us.

343
00:30:22,396 --> 00:30:23,795
What is important...

344
00:30:24,116 --> 00:30:25,629
is that we must never

345
00:30:25,836 --> 00:30:28,908
come to resemble man in anyway.

346
00:30:29,476 --> 00:30:33,310
One: Whatever goes upon two legs
is an enemy.

347
00:30:34,516 --> 00:30:35,426
Two:

348
00:30:35,636 --> 00:30:38,753
Whatever goes upon four legs
or has wings

349
00:30:39,436 --> 00:30:40,425
is a friend.

350
00:30:40,956 --> 00:30:45,313
After all, we are animals.

351
00:30:46,156 --> 00:30:49,512
Three:
No animals shallwear clothes.

352
00:30:50,436 --> 00:30:54,793
Four: No animals
shall sleep in abed.

353
00:30:55,156 --> 00:30:58,546
We can no longer stoop
to his level.

354
00:30:58,836 --> 00:31:00,906
Five: No animal

355
00:31:01,116 --> 00:31:02,947
shall drink alcohol.

356
00:31:03,156 --> 00:31:05,545
- Or engage in trade.
- Six:

357
00:31:06,396 --> 00:31:09,752
No animal shall kill
any other animal.

358
00:31:10,556 --> 00:31:13,787
Fighting each other
is the nature ofman.

359
00:31:14,196 --> 00:31:17,552
- Ah, Pincher. Sit down.
- And most importantly...

360
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:18,986
Seven:

361
00:31:19,476 --> 00:31:22,707
Amongst us animals,
there must be unity

362
00:31:23,276 --> 00:31:24,834
and comradeship.

363
00:31:25,636 --> 00:31:26,785
All animals

364
00:31:27,196 --> 00:31:28,675
are equal.

365
00:31:28,996 --> 00:31:30,793
Hurrah!

366
00:31:33,876 --> 00:31:37,107
I swear on the sacred memory
of Old Major

367
00:31:37,636 --> 00:31:40,833
to serve Napolean
before all others.

368
00:31:41,036 --> 00:31:43,345
To serve Napolean
before all others.

369
00:31:44,276 --> 00:31:45,868
Rise up, Pincher,

370
00:31:46,436 --> 00:31:49,667
and take your position as leader
of the Animal Guard.

371
00:31:52,676 --> 00:31:54,667
Bring in the other dogs.

372
00:31:55,356 --> 00:31:57,233
This is the doctrine
of Old Major.

373
00:31:57,436 --> 00:32:02,191
And it is our duty to follow
each and every commandment.

374
00:32:02,956 --> 00:32:04,150
Animals, animals.

375
00:32:04,796 --> 00:32:05,831
We have work to do.

376
00:32:06,316 --> 00:32:07,908
There's been enough discussion.

377
00:32:08,436 --> 00:32:09,664
We have aharvest to bring in.

378
00:32:10,076 --> 00:32:13,910
And let us make it apoint ofhonor
to do it quicker than humankind.

379
00:32:14,796 --> 00:32:16,673
Now, line up to receive
your instructions.

380
00:32:34,156 --> 00:32:35,748
Left abit. Straight

381
00:32:35,956 --> 00:32:39,028
ahead now.
Right abit.

382
00:32:40,796 --> 00:32:42,024
This is harder than it looks.

383
00:32:49,196 --> 00:32:51,585
I must use all my strength.

384
00:32:55,276 --> 00:32:58,632
We allworked together
in the fields andwe were happy.

385
00:33:12,796 --> 00:33:16,550
The pigs stayed inside the barn
and counted the hay.

386
00:33:16,836 --> 00:33:18,349
Only25bales

387
00:33:18,556 --> 00:33:19,909
ofhay today.

388
00:33:21,836 --> 00:33:23,713
We need more effort.

389
00:33:24,756 --> 00:33:26,508
I... I can...

390
00:33:26,836 --> 00:33:28,792
work harder.

391
00:33:52,716 --> 00:33:55,992
While Snowballworked towards
Old Major's ideals,

392
00:33:56,756 --> 00:34:00,146
Napolean made different plans.

393
00:34:00,716 --> 00:34:02,707
Are the puppies weanedyet?

394
00:34:03,276 --> 00:34:05,949
- Nearly.
- Well, we have milk to feed them.

395
00:34:06,436 --> 00:34:10,145
Take them away.
Give her some explanation.

396
00:34:11,036 --> 00:34:11,946
Animals!

397
00:34:12,156 --> 00:34:15,148
We are now ready to raise
our flag of freedom.

398
00:34:16,236 --> 00:34:17,146
Well done, Boxer.

399
00:34:18,276 --> 00:34:19,186
I give you...

400
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:22,427
the hoof and horn.

401
00:34:56,516 --> 00:34:57,551
There now.

402
00:34:57,876 --> 00:35:00,185
I toldyou we'd find him
with his neck in abottle.

403
00:35:11,436 --> 00:35:14,553
"All over in 2 weeks"
I think you said two months ago.

404
00:35:15,036 --> 00:35:17,470
This is what happens when aweak
man is allowed to run a farm.

405
00:35:18,156 --> 00:35:19,714
On my farm, there are no weak men.

406
00:35:19,956 --> 00:35:22,709
Obviously the animals are
managing better than we expected.

407
00:35:23,396 --> 00:35:25,751
- We'll have to do something.
- I'll do something.

408
00:35:26,316 --> 00:35:27,954
I'll ring his drunken throat.

409
00:35:28,436 --> 00:35:30,427
We need information
on whas going on.

410
00:35:31,156 --> 00:35:32,874
Why don't you send a spy?

411
00:35:33,236 --> 00:35:34,555
How can we send...

412
00:35:37,196 --> 00:35:38,106
No.

413
00:35:40,956 --> 00:35:42,025
But we could listen in.

414
00:35:51,636 --> 00:35:53,115
Now, don't make anynoise.

415
00:36:05,436 --> 00:36:07,154
Come on...

416
00:36:20,116 --> 00:36:21,344
So from the beginning?

417
00:36:21,716 --> 00:36:22,626
A...

418
00:36:22,836 --> 00:36:25,987
- G, B, C...
- No, no, no.

419
00:36:26,396 --> 00:36:29,069
We'll leave that for now and go
back to our discussion on animalism.

420
00:36:29,836 --> 00:36:32,873
I first started to suspect
that allwas not right

421
00:36:34,196 --> 00:36:35,948
when my puppies were

422
00:36:36,756 --> 00:36:37,871
taken.

423
00:36:40,796 --> 00:36:43,390
Do you understand
four legs good two legs bad?

424
00:36:43,676 --> 00:36:45,746
- Yes!
- Thas animalism.

425
00:36:47,556 --> 00:36:49,194
Napolean,
I want to see my puppies.

426
00:36:49,396 --> 00:36:50,829
No, Jessie.
You can't see your puppies.

427
00:36:51,476 --> 00:36:53,194
- But they're mybabies.
- Lfyou were thinking

428
00:36:53,396 --> 00:36:56,547
clearly then you would be pleased
at the special

429
00:36:56,876 --> 00:36:58,912
education that
we're going to give them.

430
00:37:00,116 --> 00:37:03,267
You surely don't want
to disadvantage your own puppies,

431
00:37:04,516 --> 00:37:05,426
do you?

432
00:37:06,116 --> 00:37:07,469
- No.
- Good.

433
00:37:07,756 --> 00:37:09,474
- No, I don't.
- Well offyou go then.

434
00:37:10,476 --> 00:37:11,955
They still need their mother.

435
00:37:15,236 --> 00:37:17,704
Her sadness will spread
to the other animals.

436
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:21,834
- Not ifwe distract them.
- Yeah.

437
00:37:25,356 --> 00:37:26,675
Education is knowledge.

438
00:37:27,356 --> 00:37:28,789
And knowledge is power.

439
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,554
Well, the knowledge I'd like is...

440
00:37:30,756 --> 00:37:33,145
Who keeps stealing
the milk and apples?

441
00:37:33,476 --> 00:37:34,989
Thas what I call knowledge.

442
00:37:35,156 --> 00:37:38,592
Share and share alike,
isn't that animalism.

443
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:42,466
- Well, where's our share?
- Animals, please.

444
00:37:42,716 --> 00:37:44,832
Who has the milk and apples?

445
00:37:45,036 --> 00:37:46,708
Who has the milk and apples?

446
00:37:47,156 --> 00:37:49,112
Who has the milk and apples?

447
00:37:49,316 --> 00:37:51,034
Who has the milk and apples?

448
00:37:51,236 --> 00:37:54,626
- Who has the milk and apples?
- We pigs have them.

449
00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:19,954
We'll let them calm down.

450
00:38:20,116 --> 00:38:22,232
Then Squealer can explain.

451
00:38:24,316 --> 00:38:25,192
Thank you.

452
00:38:27,996 --> 00:38:30,749
Back in the farm yard,
is lunchtime for the chickens.

453
00:38:31,716 --> 00:38:34,435
Chickens are also one of
Goïs wonders on the farm.

454
00:38:35,356 --> 00:38:39,269
This mother hen is showing her
chicks how to look for grain.

455
00:38:40,516 --> 00:38:41,710
God has given them a sharp

456
00:38:41,916 --> 00:38:43,554
bill so theywill have
no trouble

457
00:38:43,756 --> 00:38:45,075
picking up the bits of food.

458
00:38:48,316 --> 00:38:50,876
All of the farm animals
need lots ofwater.

459
00:38:51,076 --> 00:38:52,395
Well, of course we do.

460
00:38:55,116 --> 00:38:56,026
Animals.

461
00:38:56,836 --> 00:38:58,747
Napolean has arranged for this

462
00:38:58,956 --> 00:39:02,744
television to be here for
your enjoyment and relaxation.

463
00:39:03,276 --> 00:39:07,269
This, my friends,
is animalism in practice.

464
00:39:07,876 --> 00:39:11,585
But it is also animalism
for us pigs

465
00:39:11,796 --> 00:39:13,514
to have the milk and apples.

466
00:39:19,236 --> 00:39:20,715
That doesn't sound fair to me.

467
00:39:22,756 --> 00:39:26,431
I love milk and apples.
We all do.

468
00:39:28,636 --> 00:39:31,070
Mindyou Napolean's always right.

469
00:39:32,076 --> 00:39:34,749
I'll talk toJessie.
She'll explain.

470
00:39:38,236 --> 00:39:41,467
...feed the brain,
and ifyour brains are not fed,

471
00:39:42,156 --> 00:39:44,112
then Jones would come back.

472
00:39:44,636 --> 00:39:48,106
Do any ofyou want
to seeJones back?

473
00:39:48,276 --> 00:39:49,425
No, no!

474
00:39:49,996 --> 00:39:50,906
Good.

475
00:39:52,796 --> 00:39:54,309
Then for all our sakes,

476
00:39:54,596 --> 00:39:58,794
we will continue to drink
the milk and eat the apples.

477
00:39:59,316 --> 00:40:00,385
Yey!

478
00:40:02,556 --> 00:40:03,830
You see no grease,

479
00:40:04,036 --> 00:40:05,992
you smell no grease...

480
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:08,551
You feel no grease with Joy.

481
00:40:09,236 --> 00:40:10,908
Theywon't let me see my puppies.

482
00:40:11,716 --> 00:40:12,831
Where are they?

483
00:40:13,516 --> 00:40:14,426
I don't know.

484
00:40:16,796 --> 00:40:18,024
Boxer, the pigs

485
00:40:18,236 --> 00:40:20,227
always tell us what to do...

486
00:40:20,716 --> 00:40:21,592
what to think.

487
00:40:22,156 --> 00:40:23,669
We must have leaders.

488
00:40:24,036 --> 00:40:25,355
But what if they're wrong?

489
00:40:26,036 --> 00:40:27,992
Napolean's neverwrong.

490
00:40:28,996 --> 00:40:30,111
Dear Boxer...

491
00:40:30,316 --> 00:40:32,625
He totallybelieved in Napolean.

492
00:40:33,076 --> 00:40:35,032
He just wanted to do right.

493
00:40:37,516 --> 00:40:39,711
- Whas this rubbish?
- Is not rubbish.

494
00:40:40,236 --> 00:40:42,227
I've heard my animals
sound like that.

495
00:40:42,476 --> 00:40:46,071
There's apattern to it.
Like, like they're singing.

496
00:40:46,516 --> 00:40:48,154
- Listen!
- Yes.

497
00:40:48,516 --> 00:40:49,631
I've heard that sound.

498
00:40:49,836 --> 00:40:52,191
Is a signal. A code.

499
00:40:52,636 --> 00:40:55,867
Is something,
and is spreading.

500
00:40:58,476 --> 00:41:01,149
Four legs good, two legs bad.

501
00:41:03,036 --> 00:41:04,185
We invade.

502
00:41:06,356 --> 00:41:07,505
This is anightmare.

503
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:13,588
It will onlybe amatter of time
before the humans invade.

504
00:41:14,636 --> 00:41:16,672
- You think so?
- Yes.

505
00:41:16,956 --> 00:41:19,231
- What willwe do?
- Defend ourselves, of course.

506
00:41:20,196 --> 00:41:21,345
This is my plan.

507
00:41:32,036 --> 00:41:36,154
Is as I thought. They're
approaching from the top field.

508
00:41:37,236 --> 00:41:38,112
Send the signal.

509
00:41:38,316 --> 00:41:39,715
What if they change directions?

510
00:41:39,916 --> 00:41:41,190
Then we'll make another plan.

511
00:41:42,756 --> 00:41:44,474
Are all the animals in place?

512
00:41:44,876 --> 00:41:46,275
They're in place.

513
00:41:46,516 --> 00:41:49,508
- This isn't going to work.
- Flying partyhas taken off.

514
00:41:50,316 --> 00:41:51,874
Jessie's marshalling the sheep.

515
00:41:52,756 --> 00:41:53,632
Good.

516
00:42:28,636 --> 00:42:29,546
Give me that!

517
00:42:30,956 --> 00:42:31,866
Les go!

518
00:42:44,356 --> 00:42:45,948
As long as we stay up here,

519
00:42:46,156 --> 00:42:48,829
we're safe.
Let Snowball lead the charge.

520
00:42:51,356 --> 00:42:52,266
Get them!

521
00:43:29,916 --> 00:43:30,792
What was that?

522
00:43:40,876 --> 00:43:41,831
Charge!

523
00:44:28,876 --> 00:44:29,786
Shoot now! Shoot!

524
00:44:43,836 --> 00:44:45,349
Les get out ofhere!
Come on!

525
00:44:54,036 --> 00:44:56,391
Les get out ofhere!
Come on!

526
00:44:59,996 --> 00:45:00,792
Move!

527
00:45:07,756 --> 00:45:10,554
Let me through. Let me through.
Victory.

528
00:45:10,756 --> 00:45:12,986
Glorious victoryis ours!

529
00:45:24,076 --> 00:45:24,952
Well.

530
00:45:25,676 --> 00:45:28,110
We can't beat them.
We might have

531
00:45:28,316 --> 00:45:29,192
to join them.

532
00:45:33,156 --> 00:45:34,350
Is he breathing?

533
00:45:35,356 --> 00:45:36,311
I've killed him.

534
00:45:36,996 --> 00:45:40,909
This is war. The only good human
is a dead one.

535
00:45:41,556 --> 00:45:45,231
I've no wish to take life,
not even human life.

536
00:45:45,436 --> 00:45:46,346
No, he's all right.

537
00:45:47,396 --> 00:45:48,272
He's moving.

538
00:45:54,716 --> 00:45:55,592
Animals...

539
00:46:01,596 --> 00:46:03,234
You were so brave today.

540
00:46:03,396 --> 00:46:04,749
Yes, he was the bravest ofus all.

541
00:46:05,116 --> 00:46:07,949
- He's an animal hero first class.
- No.

542
00:46:08,636 --> 00:46:11,196
There was no one braver
than Snowball.

543
00:46:11,596 --> 00:46:14,030
Snowball. Snowball.

544
00:46:14,516 --> 00:46:17,189
Snowball. Snowball.

545
00:46:17,476 --> 00:46:18,591
My friends...

546
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:20,468
We are all heroes.

547
00:46:20,756 --> 00:46:23,065
Andwe will celebrate
this decisive day every

548
00:46:23,276 --> 00:46:27,394
Octoberwith amarch past
our glorious flag

549
00:46:27,596 --> 00:46:29,507
and the firing

550
00:46:29,716 --> 00:46:31,547
of this gun.

551
00:46:31,756 --> 00:46:34,224
Our farm is now truly

552
00:46:34,836 --> 00:46:36,792
Animal Farm.

553
00:46:37,116 --> 00:46:40,711
Napolean, Napolean, Napolean.

554
00:46:40,916 --> 00:46:42,986
Napolean, Napolean, Napolean.

555
00:47:01,236 --> 00:47:02,146
Snowball

556
00:47:02,356 --> 00:47:04,711
continued to try
to improve our lives.

557
00:47:05,476 --> 00:47:07,467
And soon came up with
anew scheme.

558
00:47:09,476 --> 00:47:10,875
We were called to ameeting.

559
00:47:11,836 --> 00:47:12,985
My friends,

560
00:47:13,196 --> 00:47:17,155
surely you can see Snowball's idea
for awindmill is awaste oflabor.

561
00:47:17,356 --> 00:47:18,869
- Yeah.
- Is not awaste.

562
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:21,152
Once built,
it will ease our labors.

563
00:47:21,356 --> 00:47:21,708
Yeah.

564
00:47:21,916 --> 00:47:24,555
Our efforts must be directed
at feeding ourselves,

565
00:47:24,756 --> 00:47:28,874
arming ourselves, barricading our
borders and defending animalism.

566
00:47:29,076 --> 00:47:29,986
- Yeah.
- No, no, no.

567
00:47:30,476 --> 00:47:31,909
For animalism to prosper

568
00:47:32,276 --> 00:47:34,836
we must convert all the animals
on all the farms.

569
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:38,985
We must send our pigeons out to
spread the message ofrevolution.

570
00:47:39,196 --> 00:47:40,231
Yeah.

571
00:47:41,156 --> 00:47:42,350
We willvote on it.

572
00:47:42,796 --> 00:47:43,706
Yeah.

573
00:47:43,916 --> 00:47:46,384
All those in favor of Napolean.

574
00:47:46,636 --> 00:47:48,194
Yeah.

575
00:47:48,596 --> 00:47:52,589
And all those in favor
of Snowball.

576
00:47:52,956 --> 00:47:55,424
Yeah.

577
00:47:55,596 --> 00:47:56,472
Animals,

578
00:47:56,676 --> 00:47:58,507
think of the benefits
of awindmill.

579
00:47:58,716 --> 00:48:00,593
Yes, it will be
hardwork to build.

580
00:48:00,956 --> 00:48:03,675
But once is built it could
save us so much labor

581
00:48:03,956 --> 00:48:06,516
that we mayhave to work
only three days aweek.

582
00:48:06,876 --> 00:48:09,754
Now, all those in favor.

583
00:48:10,396 --> 00:48:12,068
Yeah.

584
00:48:13,236 --> 00:48:14,146
You pig.

585
00:48:16,356 --> 00:48:18,108
Snowball...

586
00:48:21,236 --> 00:48:22,351
Puppies?

587
00:48:26,276 --> 00:48:28,187
Puppies, leave him,
is Snowball.

588
00:48:31,196 --> 00:48:33,187
Leave him! Puppies!

589
00:48:44,876 --> 00:48:47,470
My puppies had become
Napolean's servants.

590
00:48:48,756 --> 00:48:51,828
Snowballwas banished
and Napolean took control.

591
00:48:52,156 --> 00:48:53,908
- Thas Old Major's place.
- Friends.

592
00:48:54,076 --> 00:48:55,589
Whas he doing up there?

593
00:48:55,796 --> 00:48:59,550
Snowball is a traitor
and a criminal.

594
00:48:59,956 --> 00:49:01,912
But he was abrave fighter.

595
00:49:02,916 --> 00:49:07,034
Braveryis not enough.
Loyaltyis more important.

596
00:49:07,676 --> 00:49:12,386
You see how clever Napolean
has been, my friends.

597
00:49:13,436 --> 00:49:16,314
Of course, he's not against
the windmill.

598
00:49:16,756 --> 00:49:19,828
In fact, it was his own idea.

599
00:49:20,356 --> 00:49:24,713
He opposed it to flush out
Snowball for the traitor he is.

600
00:49:25,476 --> 00:49:27,512
Tactics, friends.

601
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:30,793
There will be no more meetings.
No more endless debates.

602
00:49:31,236 --> 00:49:32,146
From now on,

603
00:49:32,396 --> 00:49:35,752
a special committee ofpigs will
decide on all aspects of the farm.

604
00:49:36,636 --> 00:49:37,591
No!

605
00:49:38,556 --> 00:49:39,784
Thas enough.

606
00:49:44,676 --> 00:49:45,552
Now,

607
00:49:46,156 --> 00:49:50,069
I will tellyou of our plan
for the windmill.

608
00:49:53,676 --> 00:49:55,985
So began our toil.

609
00:50:02,396 --> 00:50:04,705
It was a slow,
laborious process

610
00:50:05,916 --> 00:50:07,634
andwe were watched at all times.

611
00:50:09,676 --> 00:50:13,555
It was Boxer's great strength
that reallymade the difference.

612
00:50:15,876 --> 00:50:19,107
But each and every one ofus
played our part.

613
00:50:20,956 --> 00:50:21,832
And slowly,

614
00:50:22,276 --> 00:50:25,905
very slowly the windmill
began to take shape.

615
00:50:36,916 --> 00:50:39,032
And at night we'd return home

616
00:50:40,516 --> 00:50:41,585
weary

617
00:50:43,436 --> 00:50:44,585
and hungry.

618
00:51:00,196 --> 00:51:01,151
Nothing.

619
00:51:02,356 --> 00:51:05,189
Theymust have found
the microphone. But wait. Listen.

620
00:51:05,676 --> 00:51:06,745
...to build the windmill.

621
00:51:07,956 --> 00:51:08,866
My friends...

622
00:51:09,196 --> 00:51:10,515
They can talk.

623
00:51:11,676 --> 00:51:14,395
Long live Animal Farm.

624
00:51:15,836 --> 00:51:19,306
If they can talk,
they can trade.

625
00:51:19,556 --> 00:51:21,069
You can't trade with animals.

626
00:51:21,276 --> 00:51:23,585
- Whynot?
- Is immoral.

627
00:51:23,796 --> 00:51:24,751
Is business.

628
00:51:25,236 --> 00:51:26,191
Is my farm.

629
00:51:26,556 --> 00:51:28,945
That farm has been in his family
for generations.

630
00:51:30,116 --> 00:51:32,630
Yes, andwhas he done with it?
Ruined it, thas what.

631
00:51:33,756 --> 00:51:34,984
Congratulations.

632
00:51:35,396 --> 00:51:38,547
You've actuallymanaged to turn
your father's prosperous farm

633
00:51:38,956 --> 00:51:41,675
into a debt-ridden,
crumbling piece ofrubbish.

634
00:51:42,316 --> 00:51:43,226
Very clever.

635
00:51:43,596 --> 00:51:44,995
You can't tlak to me like that.

636
00:51:45,196 --> 00:51:46,311
Yes I can.

637
00:51:46,996 --> 00:51:50,989
I can say something else as well.
You're finished around here.

638
00:51:51,756 --> 00:51:54,509
Both ofyou.
Washed up, dead in the water.

639
00:51:55,236 --> 00:51:56,749
Are these words sinking in?

640
00:51:58,476 --> 00:52:01,115
Yes, I think they are.

641
00:52:07,996 --> 00:52:11,591
Thas strange.
There's someone in the house.

642
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:20,346
This isn't right.

643
00:52:28,636 --> 00:52:30,308
They're behaving like men.

644
00:52:45,716 --> 00:52:48,867
Puppies, stop that.
I'm your mother. Stop it.

645
00:52:49,396 --> 00:52:50,590
- Stop it!
- Puppies!

646
00:52:51,076 --> 00:52:52,031
Off to bedwith you.

647
00:52:55,396 --> 00:52:56,795
What are you doing here?

648
00:52:56,996 --> 00:52:58,395
This areais out ofbounds.

649
00:52:58,716 --> 00:53:02,391
Nothing. I was just walking
and the dogs came at me.

650
00:53:03,716 --> 00:53:06,230
Have you seen anything ofinterest
in yourwalk?

651
00:53:08,556 --> 00:53:09,432
Nothing.

652
00:53:09,916 --> 00:53:11,190
Get back to the barn.

653
00:53:13,716 --> 00:53:15,672
Things were changing fast

654
00:53:16,156 --> 00:53:18,511
and at night we heard
strange noises

655
00:53:19,076 --> 00:53:21,067
as Squealer altered
the commandments.

656
00:53:23,676 --> 00:53:27,954
...with sheets.

657
00:54:00,996 --> 00:54:02,349
Avery good day to you, Mister...

658
00:54:02,756 --> 00:54:03,711
Napolean.

659
00:54:04,796 --> 00:54:07,151
Pilkington.
Very pleased to meet you.

660
00:54:08,596 --> 00:54:09,472
Splendid.

661
00:54:10,236 --> 00:54:12,067
- Splendid.
- We will go into the house.

662
00:54:12,436 --> 00:54:14,711
Absolutely, afteryou, dear boy.

663
00:54:15,436 --> 00:54:17,666
Dear boy? Dear boy?

664
00:54:23,716 --> 00:54:24,751
Wonderful.

665
00:54:25,676 --> 00:54:27,348
A porkerwith a sense ofhumor.

666
00:54:29,036 --> 00:54:30,913
Old Major's words no longer

667
00:54:31,116 --> 00:54:32,231
made any sense.

668
00:54:32,836 --> 00:54:34,952
The pigs were now living
in the house.

669
00:54:35,756 --> 00:54:37,872
Napolean was rarely seen

670
00:54:38,956 --> 00:54:41,629
but a statue had been made
in his honor and placed

671
00:54:42,276 --> 00:54:43,994
near the barn.

672
00:54:44,196 --> 00:54:47,632
Todaymarks the beginning of
anew direction for us.

673
00:54:48,196 --> 00:54:51,188
Animal Farm cannot exist
in isolation.

674
00:54:51,836 --> 00:54:53,667
To improve our quality oflife,

675
00:54:54,196 --> 00:54:57,905
to build the windmill,
to feed ourselves,

676
00:54:58,836 --> 00:55:01,066
we need to trade.

677
00:55:01,276 --> 00:55:04,268
Didn't Old Major say
we must never engage in trade?

678
00:55:04,476 --> 00:55:05,545
Is always the same.

679
00:55:05,756 --> 00:55:08,190
What goes around, comes around.

680
00:55:08,556 --> 00:55:11,787
None of this need concern
any ofyou.

681
00:55:11,956 --> 00:55:13,548
As your leader,

682
00:55:13,756 --> 00:55:17,146
I will shoulder the burden
of trade myself.

683
00:55:17,716 --> 00:55:18,626
The pigs dedicated

684
00:55:18,876 --> 00:55:22,710
to his memory the place
where Old Major had fallen.

685
00:55:23,476 --> 00:55:25,467
Our revolution continues,

686
00:55:25,916 --> 00:55:29,272
and all our actions
will now be looked on

687
00:55:29,836 --> 00:55:33,511
by the founder of our beliefs.
Pincher.

688
00:55:46,076 --> 00:55:46,952
Only criminals

689
00:55:47,156 --> 00:55:49,067
would fear Old Major's presence.

690
00:55:51,316 --> 00:55:54,035
Long live Animal Farm.

691
00:55:54,236 --> 00:55:56,113
Long live Animal Farm.

692
00:56:02,196 --> 00:56:06,030
Well, thas a tidyload ofhay,
Mr. Napolean.

693
00:56:06,316 --> 00:56:07,465
Dear boy.

694
00:56:08,556 --> 00:56:09,432
You know,

695
00:56:13,116 --> 00:56:16,153
this could prove to be
a very profitable arrangement

696
00:56:17,076 --> 00:56:18,748
between ourselves, Mr. N.

697
00:56:20,996 --> 00:56:22,190
You know you can trust me.

698
00:56:22,476 --> 00:56:25,866
I mean, I neverwanted to have
anything to do with that invasion.

699
00:56:26,476 --> 00:56:27,625
That was all Frederick

700
00:56:27,796 --> 00:56:30,629
- andJones' idea.
- Jones is our enemy.

701
00:56:30,836 --> 00:56:32,588
And I am your friend.

702
00:56:34,276 --> 00:56:35,709
Got abottle ofwhisky foryou.

703
00:56:37,956 --> 00:56:39,150
A token ofmy gratitude.

704
00:56:39,716 --> 00:56:40,944
Just try this.

705
00:56:41,516 --> 00:56:42,995
Dear boy.

706
00:56:43,756 --> 00:56:45,508
Now to business.

707
00:56:46,276 --> 00:56:48,312
There's a shortage of eggs
on the market.

708
00:56:48,676 --> 00:56:50,029
They're fetching
a very good price.

709
00:56:52,076 --> 00:56:55,352
Listen. There's something I have to
tellyou all. Is about the pigs.

710
00:56:56,316 --> 00:56:58,272
- They are living in the house.
- No.

711
00:56:58,516 --> 00:57:00,029
Yes. And they're sleeping
in the beds.

712
00:57:00,196 --> 00:57:01,345
No.

713
00:57:01,676 --> 00:57:03,029
Now is against the commandment.

714
00:57:03,236 --> 00:57:05,386
No animal shall sleep in abed.

715
00:57:05,596 --> 00:57:06,665
Yes, thas right.
Thas the...

716
00:57:06,876 --> 00:57:08,150
My friends, let me

717
00:57:08,356 --> 00:57:09,709
explain.

718
00:57:11,556 --> 00:57:15,310
As you know, we pigs
are the brains of the farm,

719
00:57:15,836 --> 00:57:18,145
andwe must have a quiet place
to work in

720
00:57:18,636 --> 00:57:19,830
for allyour sakes.

721
00:57:21,676 --> 00:57:23,826
Surely you don't want
your glorious leader

722
00:57:24,036 --> 00:57:25,674
to live in a sty.

723
00:57:27,636 --> 00:57:29,388
Of course not. Andyes,

724
00:57:29,676 --> 00:57:30,904
we do sleep

725
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:33,795
in beds, andwhynot?

726
00:57:34,436 --> 00:57:36,472
There is no ruling against beds,

727
00:57:37,076 --> 00:57:38,748
apile of straw is abed.

728
00:57:40,396 --> 00:57:41,715
Wouldyou rob us of our sleep

729
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:44,749
so that we're too tired
to carry out our duties?

730
00:57:47,076 --> 00:57:48,634
But there's the commandment.

731
00:57:48,876 --> 00:57:50,548
What commandment?

732
00:57:50,796 --> 00:57:52,752
There was never
a commandment against

733
00:57:52,916 --> 00:57:54,986
beds, read it.

734
00:57:55,716 --> 00:57:56,705
"No animal

735
00:57:56,916 --> 00:58:00,386
shall sleep in abed
with sheets".

736
00:58:00,996 --> 00:58:04,386
You see? Is a commandment
against sheets.

737
00:58:05,236 --> 00:58:07,830
Andwe certainly don't sleep
in sheets.

738
00:58:08,156 --> 00:58:09,430
Oh, no.

739
00:58:09,756 --> 00:58:11,951
Napolean is always right.

740
00:58:12,916 --> 00:58:14,474
Exactly.

741
00:58:32,916 --> 00:58:34,747
I managed to convince
the animals

742
00:58:34,956 --> 00:58:38,153
to buy those rusty old silos
I couldn't get rid of.

743
00:58:39,196 --> 00:58:41,027
Theyhaven't got a clue
what to do with them.

744
00:58:42,716 --> 00:58:44,388
Not only that,
they've built awindmill.

745
00:58:44,596 --> 00:58:47,713
And I'll end up owning that
as well asJones' farm.

746
00:58:48,556 --> 00:58:50,228
What about the hunger,
Mr. Pilkington?

747
00:58:51,156 --> 00:58:52,032
What hunger?

748
00:58:52,356 --> 00:58:55,029
I've seen some of the animals.
Flesh and bones.

749
00:58:55,436 --> 00:58:56,630
Theylook all right to me.

750
00:58:56,836 --> 00:58:59,430
Yes, but you're not seeing straight
with all that trade you're doing.

751
00:58:59,716 --> 00:59:03,868
My dear boy, if the pigs prefer
to dealwith me, should I refuse?

752
00:59:04,236 --> 00:59:07,308
The animals are starving,
and is not to your credit.

753
00:59:10,236 --> 00:59:11,510
Same again all around.

754
00:59:23,156 --> 00:59:24,430
You're still here then?

755
00:59:55,436 --> 00:59:57,631
Pilkington, I'll show him.

756
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:04,234
Let him try to get his hands
on this now.

757
01:00:17,916 --> 01:00:18,826
Quick!

758
01:00:24,436 --> 01:00:25,664
Ourwindmillwas ruined.

759
01:00:26,196 --> 01:00:27,106
Our spirits

760
01:00:27,436 --> 01:00:28,551
were at their lowest.

761
01:00:29,356 --> 01:00:30,266
But Napolean

762
01:00:30,756 --> 01:00:32,075
seemed triumphant.

763
01:00:32,316 --> 01:00:34,910
Do you know who is
responsible for this?

764
01:00:36,556 --> 01:00:40,310
Do you know who has stolen the truck
and blown up ourwindmill?

765
01:00:42,436 --> 01:00:44,074
Snowball!

766
01:00:44,276 --> 01:00:46,028
The arch-criminal and traitor

767
01:00:46,316 --> 01:00:49,308
has destroyed ourwork
of the last year.

768
01:00:50,076 --> 01:00:51,191
Animals,

769
01:00:51,916 --> 01:00:56,114
I pronounce the death sentence
on Snowball.

770
01:00:57,076 --> 01:00:58,987
We will teach this traitor

771
01:00:59,316 --> 01:01:01,784
that he cannot undo ourwork
so easily.

772
01:01:02,676 --> 01:01:04,712
The windmillwill be rebuilt.

773
01:01:04,916 --> 01:01:08,147
Everydaywe willwork,
rain or shine,

774
01:01:08,596 --> 01:01:10,109
food or none.

775
01:01:10,596 --> 01:01:13,349
Long live the windmill!

776
01:01:20,156 --> 01:01:21,032
Boxer...

777
01:01:21,396 --> 01:01:22,715
So early?

778
01:01:22,996 --> 01:01:25,430
I must get on.
We've got to rebuild

779
01:01:25,636 --> 01:01:26,830
the windmill.

780
01:01:27,956 --> 01:01:29,787
Decree number six:

781
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:33,746
Our leader pronounces that
"Beasts of the World"

782
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:35,833
was the song of the revolution

783
01:01:36,316 --> 01:01:40,150
through which we expressed
our longing for abetter society.

784
01:01:40,756 --> 01:01:43,509
But as that society
is now established,

785
01:01:44,356 --> 01:01:47,553
that song no longer
has anymeaning.

786
01:01:48,196 --> 01:01:50,994
Boxer, come on, please.
You'll hurt yourself.

787
01:01:51,436 --> 01:01:53,950
I have to do this.

788
01:01:55,436 --> 01:01:59,395
We have anew song that
gives voice to our gratitude for

789
01:01:59,596 --> 01:02:00,711
allwe have.

790
01:02:01,596 --> 01:02:04,872
Beloved leader Napolean,

791
01:02:05,076 --> 01:02:07,544
fearless faithful guardian,

792
01:02:08,356 --> 01:02:09,755
proud and strong, protect us from

793
01:02:09,956 --> 01:02:14,552
the wrong. You will defend us
with your lofty trotter...

794
01:02:14,756 --> 01:02:18,271
Pigs, our pigs,
there is no beast

795
01:02:18,476 --> 01:02:22,867
thas braver, theywill not
everwaver, they face the fight

796
01:02:23,716 --> 01:02:26,435
for right, with might...

797
01:02:27,356 --> 01:02:30,587
Glorious great and triumphant,

798
01:02:30,796 --> 01:02:32,673
gallant hero resilient,

799
01:02:33,716 --> 01:02:34,671
proud and strong,

800
01:02:35,316 --> 01:02:37,671
protect us from the wrong,
you will defend us

801
01:02:37,836 --> 01:02:42,068
with your lofty trotter...
Pigs are pigs are pigs.

802
01:03:21,596 --> 01:03:24,429
- Where is our food?
- I'm sorry, Boxer.

803
01:03:25,396 --> 01:03:27,114
I don't think
we're going to get any.

804
01:03:27,436 --> 01:03:30,269
We must have food.
I'm so hungry.

805
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:32,467
Make way for our leader.

806
01:03:43,996 --> 01:03:45,634
Our valient leader,

807
01:03:46,356 --> 01:03:50,554
animal hero first class
and animal hero second class

808
01:03:50,836 --> 01:03:52,155
will now speak.

809
01:03:52,756 --> 01:03:54,826
My friends, I have found out

810
01:03:55,036 --> 01:03:59,314
that the arch-criminal Snowball
is stillvisiting the farm.

811
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:00,666
Is he?

812
01:04:00,876 --> 01:04:02,548
I haven't seen him.

813
01:04:03,396 --> 01:04:05,068
He has even blocked drains.

814
01:04:05,556 --> 01:04:08,912
Snowball's sabotage is the reason
for our shortage of food.

815
01:04:09,596 --> 01:04:12,747
But he must have inside help.

816
01:04:13,316 --> 01:04:14,510
Which ofyou

817
01:04:14,676 --> 01:04:17,634
is in league with him?
I will findyou out.

818
01:04:17,916 --> 01:04:20,271
They guiltywill have
nowhere to hide.

819
01:04:21,356 --> 01:04:23,551
Because of this sabotage

820
01:04:23,756 --> 01:04:27,226
the hens will have to surrender
their eggs for sale in the market.

821
01:04:28,076 --> 01:04:29,953
- Thas murder.
- You hens should

822
01:04:30,156 --> 01:04:34,513
welcome this sacrifice as your own
special contribution to animalism.

823
01:04:34,836 --> 01:04:36,189
Never. Never.

824
01:04:36,396 --> 01:04:39,035
You dare defy
our glorious leader?

825
01:04:44,316 --> 01:04:46,466
We will smash our eggs
before giving them up.

826
01:04:46,676 --> 01:04:48,155
Yeah, dead right.

827
01:04:49,396 --> 01:04:51,466
All hens are criminals.

828
01:04:51,996 --> 01:04:53,111
No hen will be fed.

829
01:04:53,316 --> 01:04:56,228
Any animal seen giving food
to ahen will be punished

830
01:04:56,796 --> 01:04:58,275
by death.

831
01:05:14,916 --> 01:05:18,625
And so in the middle of the night
the hens sacrificed their eggs.

832
01:05:19,516 --> 01:05:21,347
This is so wrong.

833
01:05:24,836 --> 01:05:26,189
What have we done?

834
01:05:43,756 --> 01:05:44,632
Now what?

835
01:05:52,156 --> 01:05:54,147
Go back to sleep, my friend.

836
01:05:54,956 --> 01:05:56,389
We're just moving some ofJones'

837
01:05:56,716 --> 01:05:57,831
camera equipment.

838
01:05:58,716 --> 01:06:00,468
You'll see the films later.

839
01:06:12,396 --> 01:06:15,593
With efficiency and patriotism
the Animal Guard

840
01:06:15,796 --> 01:06:18,026
roots out enemies of the farm.

841
01:06:20,596 --> 01:06:22,154
Come with me.

842
01:06:22,356 --> 01:06:24,472
There's no hiding place for

843
01:06:24,676 --> 01:06:25,791
Snowball's cohorts.

844
01:06:26,596 --> 01:06:28,666
Don't make anoise.
Les go.

845
01:06:29,196 --> 01:06:30,390
And there's no escape from

846
01:06:30,636 --> 01:06:34,595
justice as they go on trial
for crimes against animalism

847
01:06:35,836 --> 01:06:37,394
in front of our impartial leader.

848
01:06:37,996 --> 01:06:39,190
Our commandments say

849
01:06:39,396 --> 01:06:42,911
no animal shall kill
any other animal.

850
01:06:43,236 --> 01:06:44,225
Guilty!

851
01:06:45,036 --> 01:06:46,185
...without cause.

852
01:06:47,116 --> 01:06:48,595
Without cause? Thas...

853
01:06:51,196 --> 01:06:53,027
We have cause.

854
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:54,665
Guilty!

855
01:06:56,796 --> 01:06:58,024
Guilty!

856
01:07:00,636 --> 01:07:01,512
Guilty!

857
01:07:13,996 --> 01:07:15,907
And now for other news.

858
01:07:16,716 --> 01:07:19,833
Our leader, the glorious
andvaliant Napolean,

859
01:07:20,516 --> 01:07:23,713
was today awarded highest medal
of animalism,

860
01:07:24,396 --> 01:07:26,751
the Leader's Star, first class.

861
01:07:27,676 --> 01:07:29,712
But before we close
our transmission,

862
01:07:30,156 --> 01:07:34,195
les hear some words ofpersonal
thanks for our glorious leader.

863
01:07:35,116 --> 01:07:37,027
Thanks to our beloved Napolean,

864
01:07:37,316 --> 01:07:39,705
I have laid six eggs in five days.

865
01:07:40,916 --> 01:07:44,033
Thanks to the leadership
of our beloved Napolean,

866
01:07:44,236 --> 01:07:46,591
this grass tastes
better than ever.

867
01:07:47,596 --> 01:07:51,145
And until tomorrow,
is good night from me.

868
01:07:52,356 --> 01:07:53,266
Good night.

869
01:07:55,156 --> 01:07:56,828
I like whisky.

870
01:07:57,076 --> 01:07:59,510
The pigs were behaving
more and more

871
01:07:59,716 --> 01:08:00,944
like farmerJones.

872
01:08:04,236 --> 01:08:05,225
What is it?

873
01:08:06,436 --> 01:08:07,789
Glorious

874
01:08:08,076 --> 01:08:11,546
leader Napolean,

875
01:08:12,756 --> 01:08:15,668
glorious leader,

876
01:08:16,116 --> 01:08:18,505
Napolean...

877
01:08:54,356 --> 01:08:56,665
Shut up.

878
01:09:01,396 --> 01:09:02,306
Squealer,

879
01:09:03,076 --> 01:09:06,546
come quick.
Napolean says he's dying.

880
01:09:08,436 --> 01:09:10,028
So am I.

881
01:09:10,796 --> 01:09:13,264
Napolean didn't die,
and neither

882
01:09:13,476 --> 01:09:15,512
did his taste forwhisky.

883
01:09:23,796 --> 01:09:25,309
Life was bleak.

884
01:09:27,076 --> 01:09:30,785
But nothing prepared us
forwhat happened next.

885
01:09:57,916 --> 01:10:01,033
We were on ourwayhome when
a duck brought us the bad news.

886
01:10:02,716 --> 01:10:03,626
Jessie!

887
01:10:04,116 --> 01:10:04,992
Jessie!

888
01:10:07,396 --> 01:10:10,229
Boxer has fallen by the windmill.
He's on his side.

889
01:10:11,396 --> 01:10:12,306
Boxer?

890
01:10:13,236 --> 01:10:16,308
Go! Go and tell Napolean.
Hurry.

891
01:10:16,876 --> 01:10:19,913
Up there, just on the other side
of that cloud,

892
01:10:20,076 --> 01:10:22,112
lies the kingdom in the sky.

893
01:10:22,316 --> 01:10:25,911
Where no animal ever goes hungry.
Say after me.

894
01:10:26,276 --> 01:10:27,186
"I believe in the

895
01:10:27,396 --> 01:10:29,387
- sugarcandy that grows on trees".
- Boxer!

896
01:10:29,596 --> 01:10:32,235
- "I believe in the everlasting..."
- Get off ofhim, you... Boxer!

897
01:10:33,756 --> 01:10:34,666
Boxer.

898
01:10:37,076 --> 01:10:38,191
What happened?

899
01:10:39,876 --> 01:10:43,312
I can't breath verywell.

900
01:10:43,516 --> 01:10:44,551
Hush.

901
01:10:44,756 --> 01:10:46,792
Lie still.
It will be all right.

902
01:10:46,956 --> 01:10:47,911
You'll soon feel better.

903
01:10:49,356 --> 01:10:52,792
You have enough stones here

904
01:10:52,996 --> 01:10:55,032
to finish the windmill.

905
01:10:55,556 --> 01:10:59,947
I think I maynow be
allowed to stop.

906
01:11:00,356 --> 01:11:03,075
Yes, of course, you must stop.

907
01:11:04,876 --> 01:11:09,188
I will enjoymyretirement.

908
01:11:10,916 --> 01:11:13,669
If any animal deserves to rest,
is you, Boxer.

909
01:11:25,676 --> 01:11:27,473
Here, try to drink some water.

910
01:11:28,036 --> 01:11:30,106
Yes, yes, I will.

911
01:11:31,996 --> 01:11:33,952
Anyimprovement?

912
01:11:34,996 --> 01:11:37,351
Our leader is going
to make arrangements

913
01:11:37,556 --> 01:11:40,753
to have his most loyalworker

914
01:11:41,156 --> 01:11:42,874
treated in hospital.

915
01:11:44,596 --> 01:11:46,791
Thank you.

916
01:11:47,956 --> 01:11:50,595
Now back to work.

917
01:11:51,076 --> 01:11:53,226
But I don't think
I should leave him.

918
01:12:11,716 --> 01:12:14,310
Boxer, Boxer.

919
01:12:14,676 --> 01:12:15,745
Is time to go.

920
01:12:16,196 --> 01:12:19,711
- I'm veryweak.
- Listen, Boxer.

921
01:12:20,436 --> 01:12:21,835
You're going to be fine.

922
01:12:21,996 --> 01:12:24,191
You're going to the hospital
and they'll make you better.

923
01:12:24,636 --> 01:12:26,786
Come on, you must use
allyour strength to get up.

924
01:12:27,476 --> 01:12:31,025
Yes. Is difficult.

925
01:12:31,236 --> 01:12:32,635
I know, my friend.

926
01:12:33,876 --> 01:12:35,832
Please, do it for me.

927
01:12:37,236 --> 01:12:38,430
Do it for all ofus.

928
01:12:39,396 --> 01:12:41,956
Yes, yes. I'll try.

929
01:12:46,036 --> 01:12:50,427
Quick, they're taking Boxer away.
Come and say good bye.

930
01:13:09,676 --> 01:13:13,032
Somehow Boxer managed to summon up
the last ofhis strength

931
01:13:13,916 --> 01:13:15,872
andwe watched
as he entered the van.

932
01:13:17,196 --> 01:13:18,390
Something smelledwrong.

933
01:13:18,916 --> 01:13:19,951
It made us nervous.

934
01:13:20,636 --> 01:13:21,955
Lock it up. Les go.

935
01:13:22,356 --> 01:13:23,266
No!

936
01:13:23,716 --> 01:13:25,468
- No!
- Whas going on?

937
01:13:26,036 --> 01:13:27,264
The words on the van.

938
01:13:27,796 --> 01:13:29,946
S, E, T...

939
01:13:30,116 --> 01:13:30,992
Horse slaughterer.

940
01:13:31,436 --> 01:13:33,586
They're taking him
to the glue factory.

941
01:13:35,476 --> 01:13:37,831
No, Boxer, get out.

942
01:13:38,396 --> 01:13:41,468
Boxer, come on, help me, Benny!
Boxer!

943
01:13:41,636 --> 01:13:43,035
Boxer!

944
01:13:43,476 --> 01:13:46,309
- Boxer, get out quick!
- Get out!

945
01:13:47,836 --> 01:13:48,905
Kick yourway out!

946
01:13:50,316 --> 01:13:52,876
They're taking you to your death.
Boxer!

947
01:13:54,756 --> 01:13:55,745
Boxer!

948
01:13:55,996 --> 01:13:56,951
Boxer!

949
01:13:57,676 --> 01:13:58,586
We called out

950
01:13:58,916 --> 01:14:00,235
desperately.

951
01:14:00,596 --> 01:14:02,507
But we heard him
give up the struggle.

952
01:14:13,276 --> 01:14:16,268
Well, Mr. N, thas that.

953
01:14:17,476 --> 01:14:21,389
Avery profitable afternoon.
Your share.

954
01:14:22,556 --> 01:14:24,069
Buywhiskywith it.

955
01:14:24,916 --> 01:14:25,792
Is expensive.

956
01:14:26,156 --> 01:14:28,147
Use all the money.

957
01:14:29,396 --> 01:14:32,433
- Certainly, my friend.
- I like whisky.

958
01:14:43,236 --> 01:14:44,464
I could have saved him.

959
01:14:45,316 --> 01:14:47,227
Nobody can save any ofus.

960
01:14:47,436 --> 01:14:48,312
I could have.

961
01:14:48,716 --> 01:14:49,944
How?

962
01:14:50,156 --> 01:14:51,555
I found aplace
at the edge of the farm.

963
01:14:52,036 --> 01:14:53,310
A good place to hide.

964
01:14:54,036 --> 01:14:56,186
I should have taken him there.
But I did nothing.

965
01:14:57,276 --> 01:14:58,550
I'll never forgive myself.

966
01:14:58,796 --> 01:15:01,993
Well, you could put
the wrong right.

967
01:15:02,436 --> 01:15:04,472
Yeah, yes, you're right.

968
01:15:05,116 --> 01:15:08,108
Murielwill not last much longer.
And there are others.

969
01:15:08,676 --> 01:15:09,870
Then we must save them.

970
01:15:10,436 --> 01:15:13,155
We must leave this place
with as many animals as we can.

971
01:15:13,356 --> 01:15:14,425
Thas it.

972
01:15:15,716 --> 01:15:16,751
Forward,

973
01:15:17,276 --> 01:15:20,507
forward in the name
of the revolution.

974
01:15:21,516 --> 01:15:24,235
Long live Animal Farm.

975
01:15:24,436 --> 01:15:25,346
Long live

976
01:15:26,476 --> 01:15:28,671
our beloved Napolean.

977
01:15:28,916 --> 01:15:31,874
Napolean is always right.

978
01:15:33,156 --> 01:15:34,509
Those were his

979
01:15:34,676 --> 01:15:36,985
last words.

980
01:15:40,476 --> 01:15:41,545
Rumors.

981
01:15:42,076 --> 01:15:46,194
Some ofyou are saying that
the van that took Boxer away

982
01:15:46,556 --> 01:15:49,946
was from the horse slaughterer.

983
01:15:50,316 --> 01:15:53,991
Surely you know our beloved
leader better than that.

984
01:15:55,036 --> 01:15:58,426
The van was from the hospital

985
01:15:59,036 --> 01:16:02,346
but had previouslybeen
the property of

986
01:16:03,156 --> 01:16:04,714
the slaughterer.

987
01:16:05,036 --> 01:16:08,267
So no more rumors.

988
01:16:15,836 --> 01:16:16,825
Mindyour step.

989
01:16:19,436 --> 01:16:23,065
Thas right.
Come on in now.

990
01:16:23,396 --> 01:16:25,626
Delighted to join you for

991
01:16:25,836 --> 01:16:27,030
aneighborly drink,

992
01:16:27,236 --> 01:16:28,305
aren't we, Mrs. P?

993
01:16:28,596 --> 01:16:31,156
- We certainly are.
- What are they doing here?

994
01:16:32,076 --> 01:16:33,225
Thas right, my dear.
Come around here.

995
01:16:33,996 --> 01:16:35,634
There. You sit here.

996
01:16:35,836 --> 01:16:38,304
Okay, there we are.

997
01:16:40,036 --> 01:16:41,435
Nice and friendly, eh?

998
01:16:45,076 --> 01:16:47,465
I've heard such alot
about you, Mr. N.

999
01:16:49,436 --> 01:16:50,312
So...

1000
01:16:50,956 --> 01:16:54,187
All getting on splendidly.
Mayl?

1001
01:16:54,356 --> 01:16:56,586
- No, you can't.
- Quiet!

1002
01:16:56,796 --> 01:16:58,752
You're letting him drink
all ourwhisky.

1003
01:16:59,116 --> 01:17:01,710
Lfyou're not quiet, I'll stick you
on top of that flagpole forever.

1004
01:17:04,196 --> 01:17:05,265
A toast.

1005
01:17:11,956 --> 01:17:14,072
Allow me.

1006
01:17:19,556 --> 01:17:21,990
Absolutely, dear boy.

1007
01:17:26,236 --> 01:17:27,555
Allow me to congratulate you on

1008
01:17:27,756 --> 01:17:28,825
keeping your lower

1009
01:17:29,036 --> 01:17:30,151
animals in order.

1010
01:17:31,076 --> 01:17:33,067
- Thank you.
- An example to all

1011
01:17:33,276 --> 01:17:35,631
farmers.
I mean, les face it.

1012
01:17:35,876 --> 01:17:38,674
No animal suffered from
working alittle harder

1013
01:17:38,876 --> 01:17:41,106
or eating alittle less,
did they?

1014
01:17:42,756 --> 01:17:44,667
Present company excluded,
of course.

1015
01:17:45,516 --> 01:17:48,747
Another toast to Animal Farm.

1016
01:17:49,316 --> 01:17:51,352
No, not Animal Farm.

1017
01:17:51,876 --> 01:17:53,673
I've decidedwe should revert

1018
01:17:53,876 --> 01:17:56,913
to our proper name of Manor Farm.

1019
01:17:58,316 --> 01:17:59,715
To Manor Farm then.

1020
01:18:01,036 --> 01:18:03,231
And our continued prosperity.

1021
01:18:03,436 --> 01:18:05,950
Absolutely, dear boy.

1022
01:18:09,156 --> 01:18:11,465
I can't tell the difference
between them.

1023
01:18:21,716 --> 01:18:23,149
Read it to me.

1024
01:18:24,516 --> 01:18:27,747
"All animals are equal, but

1025
01:18:28,036 --> 01:18:31,153
some animals are more equal
than others".

1026
01:18:31,876 --> 01:18:33,434
More equal than others.

1027
01:18:34,956 --> 01:18:38,346
Come on, we should leave
while we still can.

1028
01:18:39,156 --> 01:18:40,384
I'll get the others.

1029
01:18:40,596 --> 01:18:42,029
And now we go
to our leader's house

1030
01:18:42,396 --> 01:18:46,674
where earlier today a spontaneous
demonstration took place.

1031
01:18:47,916 --> 01:18:50,794
A grateful duck has written
anew song

1032
01:18:50,996 --> 01:18:52,509
for our beloved leader,

1033
01:18:52,956 --> 01:18:56,346
and she's here joined by
chorus of the Animal

1034
01:18:56,756 --> 01:18:57,666
Guard.

1035
01:18:59,036 --> 01:19:02,346
Praise to him,
the font of all ourwisdom...

1036
01:19:02,596 --> 01:19:06,475
Long to live the ruler
of our farm, Napolean...

1037
01:19:07,036 --> 01:19:10,995
Mightyleader, mightyleader,
watching over us...

1038
01:19:12,036 --> 01:19:14,675

Shout, shout, shout out loud,

01:19:21,476 --> 01:19:24,468
Friend on high

1042
01:19:24,716 --> 01:19:29,187
Teach us how to be as kind as you,
Napolean, mightyleader.

1043
01:19:29,396 --> 01:19:33,753
Mightyleaderwatching over us.

1044
01:19:33,956 --> 01:19:37,585
Napolean, mightyleader...

1045
01:19:37,796 --> 01:19:39,832
Mightyleaderwatching over us.

1046
01:19:41,036 --> 01:19:44,426
Shout, shout, shout out loud,
snout, snout, pink and proud...

1047
01:19:44,676 --> 01:19:47,713
Perfect pig you bless us
with your beauty.

1048
01:19:47,916 --> 01:19:50,589
Hallowed hog,
how wondrous is your glow...

1049
01:19:51,116 --> 01:19:53,471
Napolean, mightyleader...

1050
01:19:54,116 --> 01:19:56,630
Mightyleaderwatching over us.

1051
01:19:57,276 --> 01:19:59,665
Napolean, mightyleader...

1052
01:20:00,836 --> 01:20:03,873
Mightyleaderwatching over us.

1053
01:20:04,396 --> 01:20:07,593
Shout, shout, shout out loud,
snout, snout, pink and proud...

1054
01:20:07,796 --> 01:20:10,788
Shout, shout, shout out loud,
snout, snout, pink and proud...

1055
01:20:11,076 --> 01:20:13,670
Four legs good,
two legs better.

1056
01:20:13,916 --> 01:20:17,033
Four legs good,
two legs better.

1057
01:20:17,236 --> 01:20:20,433
Four legs good,
two legs better.

1058
01:20:20,636 --> 01:20:23,673
Four legs good,
two legs better.

1059
01:20:24,276 --> 01:20:27,029
Four legs good,
two legs better.

1060
01:20:32,076 --> 01:20:36,388
Animals! Never again willwe be
threatened by our enemies.

1061
01:20:36,836 --> 01:20:40,829
I decree this farmwill now devote
itself to the making ofweapons,

1062
01:20:41,276 --> 01:20:42,504
to the building ofwalls,

1063
01:20:43,156 --> 01:20:45,590
to the protection of ourselves
and ourway oflife.

1064
01:20:45,916 --> 01:20:47,827
The revolution is over.

1065
01:20:49,036 --> 01:20:52,665
All animals are now free.

1066
01:21:04,556 --> 01:21:05,625
Free?

1067
01:21:06,476 --> 01:21:09,627
Life had been far from free
in our hideout.

1068
01:21:11,316 --> 01:21:15,025
Seasons came andwent.
Andwe waited.

1069
01:21:27,596 --> 01:21:28,915
The years passed.

1070
01:21:29,276 --> 01:21:32,905
We grew old. But we stillwaited.
Waited for...

1071
01:21:33,116 --> 01:21:34,549
what surelymust pass.

1072
01:21:35,196 --> 01:21:38,108
Waited for Napolean's
cruelty and greed

1073
01:21:38,476 --> 01:21:40,353
to bleed the farm to death.

1074
01:21:54,596 --> 01:21:56,234
And now with the coming
of the storm

1075
01:21:56,516 --> 01:21:59,826
came the first signs
that ourwait was over.

1076
01:22:00,756 --> 01:22:03,190
It was time for us to return
to that place

1077
01:22:03,876 --> 01:22:06,265
that had once been
full of such hope.

1078
01:22:09,196 --> 01:22:10,106
I wondered if anything

1079
01:22:10,396 --> 01:22:12,273
was still alive.
I knew in my

1080
01:22:12,476 --> 01:22:13,989
heart that Napolean had fallen

1081
01:22:16,596 --> 01:22:18,154
victim ofhis own madness.

1082
01:22:18,356 --> 01:22:19,266
But what of

1083
01:22:19,436 --> 01:22:20,312
the others?

1084
01:22:21,676 --> 01:22:23,109
After allwe had been through,

1085
01:22:24,436 --> 01:22:27,109
I needed to believe
that there was still hope.

1086
01:22:43,276 --> 01:22:44,948
Could this be the same place

1087
01:22:45,876 --> 01:22:47,309
where Old Major had spoken

1088
01:22:47,516 --> 01:22:48,505
ofhis dream?

1089
01:22:49,316 --> 01:22:52,114
Where we hadworked so hard
for abetter life?

1090
01:22:53,076 --> 01:22:54,145
All that was left was

1091
01:22:54,356 --> 01:22:55,584
the memory and the pain of the

1092
01:22:55,756 --> 01:22:57,587
poor creatures who had suffered.

1093
01:22:58,796 --> 01:22:59,751
Myheart sank.

1094
01:23:06,636 --> 01:23:08,752
But there are always survivors.

1095
01:23:22,156 --> 01:23:24,192
The walls had now fallen.

1096
01:23:25,076 --> 01:23:27,067
The skies have healed.

1097
01:23:29,756 --> 01:23:31,474
And life goes on.

1098
01:23:43,396 --> 01:23:44,272
Andwhat of the

1099
01:23:44,476 --> 01:23:45,352
future?

1100
01:23:46,476 --> 01:23:48,068
There are new owners.

1101
01:23:49,756 --> 01:23:52,714
We will not allow them
to make the same mistakes.

1102
01:23:54,476 --> 01:23:56,148
We will rebuild the farm.

1103
01:23:58,356 --> 01:24:00,995
And now at last we shall be free.
