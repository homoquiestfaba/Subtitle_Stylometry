Does it burn in you, the hunger,

721
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:30,888
for blood, for flesh?

722
01:18:30,984 --> 01:18:34,824
Is it sweet to you,
the scent of my son's kills?

723
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:36,744
Tell me, hero.

724
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:40,872
Whose world do you
really belong to, theirs or mine?

725
01:18:40,968 --> 01:18:44,584
Here and now
it's just you and me.

726
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:46,792
And I will see you
pay for your sins.

727
01:18:46,984 --> 01:18:50,056
Do you dare?
Would you know me?

728
01:18:50,152 --> 01:18:54,088
I'm old, child--
older than sin.

729
01:18:54,184 --> 01:18:57,160
Would you take me here in the dark?
Do your loins at this moment,

730
01:18:57,256 --> 01:18:59,656
at this moment of death,
do they burn for me?

731
01:18:59,752 --> 01:19:03,400
I burn, but not for you.

732
01:19:03,496 --> 01:19:06,280
So be it.

733
01:19:06,376 --> 01:19:09,832
You've come for answers.
See what the truth brings you.

734
01:19:15,464 --> 01:19:18,248
[ Flesh Tearing ]

735
01:19:31,592 --> 01:19:35,720
Come, sample the true delights
of flesh with me.

736
01:19:36,872 --> 01:19:39,080
Feel what no human woman
can offer you.

737
01:19:45,864 --> 01:19:47,688
[ Screeches ]

738
01:19:54,216 --> 01:19:55,848
It's time.

739
01:20:27,688 --> 01:20:29,128
[ Shrieks ]

740
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:33,928
[Kyra]
Beowulf!.

[ Shrieking ]

745
01:21:31,368 --> 01:21:33,672
- [ Whimpering ]
- Come on.

746
01:21:33,768 --> 01:21:36,264
Let's go.

747
01:21:37,608 --> 01:21:39,912
Come on. We have to go.

748
01:21:51,528 --> 01:21:54,856
[ Whinnying ]

749
01:22:15,208 --> 01:22:17,896
I lost everyone I loved
in that place.

750
01:22:19,144 --> 01:22:21,640
My whole life was there.

751
01:22:21,736 --> 01:22:24,424
Where will you go?

752
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:28,232
With you.

753
01:22:28,328 --> 01:22:32,648
I don't know where I'm going,
Or what I'll find when I get there.

754
01:22:32,744 --> 01:22:37,352
If I stay with you the darkness
will seek me out.

755
01:22:37,448 --> 01:22:39,368
And how would I protect you?

756
01:22:39,464 --> 01:22:42,248
I'll show you,

757
01:22:42,344 --> 01:22:44,360
if you let me.

758
01:22:45,512 --> 01:22:48,104
It's not safe to be with me.

759
01:22:50,312 --> 01:22:54,344
It's clear to me that by your side
is the safest place there is.

760
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:57,768
I can't make you any guarantees.

761
01:22:57,864 --> 01:23:00,936
[Chuckling]

762
01:23:01,032 --> 01:23:02,952
I'll take that chance.

763
01:23:03,144 --> 01:23:05,160
[Chuckling]
