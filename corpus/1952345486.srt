Oh my baby's 16.
I can't believe it.

51
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,040
Bob are you crying?

52
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,910
What? No Sue.

53
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,310
I've got an eyelash in my eye.
Oh.

54
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,710
Look it's your first
16th birthday picture.

55
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,580
Ech Dad.

56
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,250
What? I like it.

57
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,120
It's going to go
on our family Web page.

58
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,620
No.
Come on sweetheart.

59
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:07,950
Make a wish.

60
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:10,020
Okay.

61
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,290
You know what I wish?

62
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,560
I wish my dear sweet family
would finally understand

63
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,400
they can't just barge into
my room any time they want.

64
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,370
I'm not a kid anymore.

65
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,070
I need privacy and boundaries.

66
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,040
I need my own space.

67
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,100
I've been looking forward
to this day all my life

68
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,070
and now that it's here I wish
you would all just get out

69
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,040
and stop spoiling it.

70
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,010
Love you.

71
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,420
I don't know.

72
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,960
Mm. Ow. Ow! Eww.

73
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,930
I'm 16 finally.

74
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:01,940
Today is going to be magical.

75
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,220
Told you she wouldn't like it.

76
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,760
I don't understand her.

77
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,360
She's probably nervous
about her Sweet 16 party.

78
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,860
Oh Bob the party lights.
They're in the garage.

79
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,400
I'm on it.

80
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,830

It's for your sister.

82
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,000
Too yellow.

83
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,040
Too blue.

84
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,470
Too pink.

85
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,210

What?

109
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,620

the best party ever.

Hey that's private.

111
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,560
Yeah not really.

112
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,300
You honestly thought
you'd get all this today?

113
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,460
I'm an essentially
hopeful person.

114
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,000
The first one's hilarious.

115
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,410
The Joey Lockhart.

116
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,740
He's an international pop star
with about a bazillion fans.

117
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:41,940
Why would you even wish that?

118
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,280
I was 7.
You were delusional.

119
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:48,380
You were 5
and wore a cape to school.

120
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:53,080
The other wishes are more
realistic like wish number 3.

121
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,390
No no no.

122
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,990
Sassy.

123
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,330
Mm not a good idea Abs.

124
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,560

128
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,440
It's not a mug shot.

129
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,610
It's Logan Buchanan.

130
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,610
Your crushed
on the quarterback?

131
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,880
How cliché.

132
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,550
For your information
he's also in the drama club

133
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,180
and once attended
Chess Masters.

134
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,880
I know. I was there.

135
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,390
He wanted to buy my chem notes.

136
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,820
He's perfect.

137
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,260
And if I get my wish
he'll talk to me today.

00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,690
Hey can I ride?

184
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,200
Hop in.

185
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,760
Buckle up.

186
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:26,240
Great.
I'll just take the bus.

187
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,740
By myself on my birthday.

188
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,350
Hmm.

189
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,600
Here.

190
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,640
Mm.

191
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:57,370
Thanks Jay.

192
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:58,940
You look pathetic.

193
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:03,980
Nice to know I can count on
you to state the obvious.

194
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,580
Sorry about your house.

195
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:07,350
How'd you know?

196
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,220
Krista texted
the entire junior class.

197
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,950
That's just peachy.

198
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,190
What's this?

199
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,520
Happy Birthday?

200
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,790
Not really.

201
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,860
Come on.

202
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,660
It's beautiful Jay.
Where's the other half?

203
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,530
Best friends forever.

204
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:34,440
Oh Jay that's sweet.

205
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,870
Do you like it?

206
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:36,940
I love it.

207
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:40,070
It's the best thing that's
happened to me all day.

208
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,210
That bad huh?

209
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,580
Yes.

210
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,940
I've been planning
for this day for eight years.

211
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,110
I mean this was
supposed to be the day

212
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,550
I started acquiring
all of the wonderful things

213
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,380
that come with being
grown up...

214
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,650
things like freedom
and privacy and respect.

215
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:56,860
But what do I get?

216
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,390
Wasps. Wasps.

217
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,830
Even my backyard is infested.

218
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,460
Where am I going to have
my Sweet 16 party?

219
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,730
You could use my basement.

220
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,770
Ew. No.

221
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,930
All right.

222
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:13,140
Well the day is young.

223
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,100
Good things could still happen.

224
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,740
Like what?
Like taking the bus?

225
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,610
I hate taking the bus.

226
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,010
This is the worst birthdays
in the history of birthdays.

227

228
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,120
Today wasn't supposed
to be like this.

229
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:38,090
Today was supposed to be...
magical.

230
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,860
Abigail Jensen?

231
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,170
Y-Y-Yes.

232
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,630
This is for you.

233
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,810
Happy Birthday sweetie.

234
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,350
Don't open it.
Why?

235
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:16,450
Real mail is delivered to
your house not your bus stop.

236
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,560
So?
It could be a bomb.

237
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,960
It's not a bomb.
It's a birthday present.

238
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,190
And I'm opening it.

239
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,300
"Make a wish light a candle

240
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,940
and watch your Sweet 16
birthday wishes come true."

241
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,340
Great.

242
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:39,640
Candles.

243
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,370
Not even a stupid gift card.

244
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,910
Wait there's something else.

245
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,280
Hold this.

246
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,380
What are you doing?

247
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,350
Read wish number 8.

248
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,350
"When I'm 16..."

249
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:59,050
I'm lighting
one of these candles.

250
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:00,920
What if something bad happens?

251
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,560
What if something good happens?

252
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:05,130
And look if it's a joke

253
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,460
the worst that can happen
is we take the bus.

254
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,500
Here.

255
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,780
Ladies and gentlemen

256
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,580
Joey Lockhart!

257
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:40,260
You Abby Jensen?

258
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,390

271
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,930
I've had a crush on him
since I was 7.

272
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,030
When I'm 16
I'll meet Joey Lockhart.

273
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,330
What are you talking about?

274
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,830
It's wish number 1.

275
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,800
Look Jay. The candles work.

276
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:39,200
Yeah but we're still
stuck taking the bus.

277
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,700
Maybe not.

278
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:44,470
I lit candle number 1 and wish
number 1 on my list came true.

279
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,210
I think the numbers
on the candles

280
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,940
correspond with the numbers
on my wish list.

281
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,410
Give me number 8.

282
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,790
When I'm 16 I'll have
my own car preferably red.

283
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,690
No way.

284
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:08,030
Way.

285
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,860
Check it out.

286
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,760
Gosh this is fun.

287
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,600
I can't believe it.
This is my dream car.

288
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,400
It's all yours sweetie.
Want to drive?

289
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,670
Yes.
No.

290
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,400
Come on. I have my permit.

291
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,610
My dad lets me practice

292
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,110
in the Hasty Mart
parking lot all the time.

293
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,640
Yeah at midnight
when it's empty.

294
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,110
Abby when a total stranger
drives up to you on the street

295
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,180
and offers you a car
you can't just take it.

296
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:37,020
She's not a total stranger.
You look very familiar.

297
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:38,950
Well we're not doing this.

298
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,850
Why not?
Yeah why not?

299
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:44,020
Because...
you don't have a driver's license

300
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,490
until you take the test
after school.

301
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,630
Good point. I'll drive.
You two get in.

302
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,290
What? Not until you
tell us who you are.

303
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:53,660
I'm Celeste. I'm here to make
Abby's 16 wishes come true.

304
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:57,870
Oh. Well that explains
pretty much exactly nothing.

305
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,400
Come on Jay.

306
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:03,370
This is the most wonderful
amazing magical thing

307
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,540
that's ever happened to me.

308
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:07,970
50 years from now when you're
looking back at your life

309
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,640
don't you want
to be able to say

310
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,740
you had the guts
to get in the car?

311
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,350
I'm going to regret this.

312
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:20,180
Yes! Get your stuff.
Come on. Get in the car.

313
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,020
All right go go go.

314
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,560
Just so we're clear you're
some kind of magical being

315
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,890
like an elf or a fairy?

316
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,660
Sure. Why not?

317
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,900
You don't sound so sure.
Jay.

318
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,400
You just do birthdays
or other events too?

319
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,860
He babbles when he's nervous.

320
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:41,400
Why don't you relax Jay
and enjoy the ride?

321
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,570
Hold on.

322
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,740
Yahoo!

323
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,680
Whoa! Mommy!

324
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,750
Whoo!

325
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:57,250
That was awesome.

326
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,950
Have we landed yet?
What's it look like?

327
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,620
What does what look like?
Her home planet.

328
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,180
Sorry Jay.

329
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:06,120
The only alien planet you'll be
visiting today is high school.

330
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,060
I already have my license.

331
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,260
My dad has connections
at the DMV.

332
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:18,530
Yo Logan check out that ride.

333
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,100
Hey Jensen did you
get new wheels too?

334
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,710
Uh...

335
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,280
Yeah. These are my new wheels

336
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:41,250
which I bought myself for
my birthday which is today.

337
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:42,290
Cool.

338
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,560
No way this is yours.

339
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,720
What can I say?

340
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,660
I'm a saver
not a spender like you.

341
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:49,960
Oh man.

342
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,830
I got to make some bank.

343
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:04,840
Umm...

344
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:06,910
What are you doing?

345
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,440
Saving you from more
humiliation.

346
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,110
What?
I'm not humiliated.

347
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,780
This is the best birthday ever.

348
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,180
Look. Wish number 15.

349
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:16,080
When I'm 16 I'll have
the best party ever.

350
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,550
If the candles keep
working like this

351
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,550
my party's going to be sick.

352
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,220
Hey party tonight at my house.

353
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,550
You're all invited.

354
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,630
Come on.

355
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,760
Come on. It's okay.

356
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,330
It's okay.

357
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:44,970
Want to make some cash?

358
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:46,210
Yes.

359
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,540
Put these up everywhere.

360
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:50,710
Meet me at the voting table
after first period.

361
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:58,050
Okay. You go find
some real clothes to wear.

362
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,250
I'll tell Miss Hackl
you got a late time okay?

363
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,290
Thanks Jay.

364
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:10,330
Ugh.

365
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,360
Ew.

366
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,500
When I'm 16...

367
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,980
For me? Thank you.

368
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,350
Okay.

369
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,350
Wish number 2. All right.

370
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,530
Okay.

371
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,430
What?

372
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,220
What's going on?

373
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,820
Come on.

374
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,550
Uh Miss Duffy.

375
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,890
Jensen.

376
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,160
I'll take that.

377
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:36,230
Keep it up Theodore and
you'll be president one day.

378
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,490
You really think so?

379
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:38,660
Absolutely.

380
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,700
Ohh!

381
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:43,570
So you can tell the future too?

382
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,330
Oh no. Just gave Ted hope.

383
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,400
Come on in.

384
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,310
So what's up sweetie?

385
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,310
What's up?
You know what's up.

386
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,010
That's why you're here pretending
to be the counselor.

387
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,940
Why didn't that
stupid candle light?

388
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,610
Because of the rules.

389
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,610
The rules?

390
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,240
Oh boy. You don't
get out much do you?

391
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,510
What are you talking about?

392
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:08,320
The candles are magic
and all magic has rules.

393
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:11,120
One candle
and one wish per hour.

394
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:13,350
You lit candle number 1
at 7:58 this morning

395
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:15,190
and Joey Lockhart showed up.

396
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,520
Then you lit candle number 8
at precisely 8 A.M.

397
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,700
Your wishes were two minutes apart
but within different hours.

398
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:24,460
Oh. So now I have to wait...

399
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,130
- 27 minutes. - ...
before I make another wish.

400
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:29,840
Great. You could have printed
that on the box you know.

401
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:33,670
Any other magic candle rules
I should know about?

402
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:36,680
Only one but it's a doozy.

403
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:39,510
The magic in the candles
expires at midnight tonight

404
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:41,780
so no more wishes after then.

405
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,990
Oh and all the wishes you've
made by then become permanent.

406
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,790
At midnight.
Yeah.

407
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,920
So at midnight that gorgeous
car out there is mine forever?

408
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,090
Absolutely.

409
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:55,160
And in 26 1/2 minutes I'll have
cuter clothes than Krista Cook.

410
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,060
Yeah.

411
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,170
She really can't stand you.

412
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,830
Oh.

413
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:02,140
You know about that?

414
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,310
I shouldn't do this but...

415
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:12,680
Read for yourself.

416
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:15,310
♪ Oh yeah ♪

417
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:18,380
Oh no.

418
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,950
I couldn't.

419
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,480
Well maybe just a page or two.

420
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,950
I suggest 10 23 and 37.

421
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:26,160
Oh.

422
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:29,260
Be a little more careful where
you light those puppies.

423
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:30,560
Thanks.

424
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:33,030
Hmm.

425
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:45,370
Whoa.

426
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:46,810
Good stuff?

427
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,380
You have no idea.

428
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:00,920
Thanks for voting for me.

429
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,360
Krista!

430
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:05,590
I know you've loathed me
since we were 8 years old

431
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:07,730
but I didn't know
you've been keeping score.

432
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,930
Where did you get that?

433
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,360
From the Birthday Fairy.

434
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,530
Right. Give it to me.

435
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:16,300
When we were 10
I had my first sleepover

436
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,730
so you decided to have one too

437
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:20,470
but you paid everybody
to come to yours.

438
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,240
You have no right
to read that. It's mine.

439
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:26,110
Well then why
is it all about me?

440
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:30,240
When we were 12 I entered
the school talent show

441
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,510
with my baton twirling act.

442
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:34,180
So you entered too
juggli 12 batons.

Every year you' competed with
me and every year you've won.

445
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,620
You've tortured me
since the grade.

446
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:40,790
Can you just give it a rest?

447
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,590
Don't play innocent with me.

448
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,120
You know what you did.

449
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,260
And for this I'm going to make
sure nobody comes to your party.

450
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:49,460
Here.

451
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:50,590
What's this?

452
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:53,460
It's an invitation to my Sweet
16 birthday party tonight.

453
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,960
Everybody's going to be there.

454
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,270
Now if you'll excuse me I
have some campaigning to do.

455
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,970
Krista you don't
need to campaign.

456
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,170
You're the only name on the
ballot running for president.

457
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:05,870
Well then I'm sure to win.

458
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,340
Why are you doing this?

459
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,680
You're not even interested
in student government.

460
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:09,980
And you are?

461
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:13,240
Well I... I didn't think so.

462
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,680
Ahem.

463
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:16,180
Hey Krista.

464
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,920
So they said you needed
help with something?

465
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:21,350
Hand these out for me.

466
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,720
Sure.

467
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:23,720
Thanks.

468
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,660
She's doing it.
She's ruining my birthday.

469
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:31,760
Again.

470
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:34,860
Just don't let her get to you.

471
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:36,430
You're right Jay.

472
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:39,100
I'm going to put an end
to her reign of terror.

473
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,900
Right about now.

List. Hurry.

475
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,170
When I'm 16 I'll have
the cutest clothes in school.

476
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,440
Hi-hi.

477
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,140
Celeste it's beautiful.

478
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,310
I know right?

479
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:31,480
I've been waiting for you
to make this wish.

480
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:34,480
I just love shopping
especially when it's free.

481
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,250
I don't even know
where to start.

482
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:37,690
That's what I'm here for.

483
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,250
Now close your eyes
and let me work my magic.

484
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,960
Ever since the third grade
whatever I did Krista did better.

485
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:48,360
She's never satisfied unless
she's winning and I'm losing.

486
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,100
But today I decided she's t going
to make me miserable anymore.

487
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:58,300
I have a plan and this
wish it's the first part.

488
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,870
Would you say
Krista Cook always has

489
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,270
the cutest clothes in school?

490
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:03,280
And shoes and handbags.

491
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,510
Not anymore.

492
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:24,730
That top is not an original
you-know-who is it?

493
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,700
It is.

494
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:27,870
Shut up.

495
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,930
Oh those shoes
are so to die for.

496
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:31,770
I hate you.

497
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,070
Want to have lunch near us?

498
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,270
Sure.

499
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:37,370
Yay. I totally just want to
sit next to that handbag.

500
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:39,440
You mean this handbag?

501
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:44,910
I got it for my birthday last year.

502
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,510
You're not all that Jensen.

503
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:52,420

birthday of my entire life.

513
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:33,120
Well good luck with that
because it's not over yet.

514
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,210
All right everybody.
On the track in five.

515
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,270
Late again Jensen.

516
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,710
Yes Miss Duffy I am late.

517
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,650
I had to go back to my locker
for this.

518
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,550
I see.

519
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,020
That's still no excuse
for tardiness

520
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:14,520
but that is a beautiful bag.

521
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,960
It's for you.

522
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:19,020
Me?
Mm-hmm.

523
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,730
I was saving it
for your Christmas present

524
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:25,460
but look it matches
your track suit perfectly.

525
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,970
Ha ha! It actually does.

526
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,900
Happy Monday.

527
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:30,170
Well Happy Monday to me.

528
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:34,370
Well ladies what do you say
instead of running killer laps

529
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:36,800
we all have a nice friendly
game of volleyball?

530

00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,380
Duck!

544
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:02,250
1-zip.

545
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,580
You tried to hit me.

546
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,990
It's called spiking.
It's how you win.

547
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,860
Play ball!

548
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:42,250
MVP! MVP!

549
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,150
Hey are you all right?

550
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,420
I'm going
to call the nurse okay?

551
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:47,550
Stay here.

552
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:51,790
MVP! MVP! MVP!

553
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:01,300
Oh well look who's awake.

554
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:04,530
How are you feeling?

555
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:06,070
I'm fine.

556
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,810
I had a weird nightmare.

557
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,240
Oh honey that was real.
Abby Jensen creamed you.

558
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,140
Oh and you're wanted
in the principal's office.

559
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,320
Run along.

560
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:29,960
Yeah that's so true.
That's so true.

561
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,960
Makes my day.
Yeah.

562
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,700
You wanted to see me
Mr. Smith?

563
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:37,000
Yeah. Yeah.

564
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,770
Ms. Cook
the election's over.

565
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:43,810
How can it be over?
A lot of people haven't voted yet.

566
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:49,250
Actually we had a 100% voter turnout.

567
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,050
Whoop! Ooh!

568
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:54,320
What's going on here?

569
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:04,030
Good morning students!

570
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:06,030
I'm very pleased to announce

571
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:09,700
the winner of the most votes
for the Student Body President

572
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:13,770
is Abby Jensen!

573
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,610
Yes!

574
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:21,450
I just want to thank
everyone who voted for me

575
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,880
and made this dream possible.

576
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:25,210
No. It's not possible.

577
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,180
Her name isn't
even on the ballots!

578
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,920
Let... go.

579
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:39,060
That is all.

580
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:40,860
Whoa. Wow.
You all right?

581
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:42,400
Abby was a write-in.

582
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:51,400
Better luck next time Krista.

583
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:18,560
Ha!

584
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,560
I finally beat Krista Cook.

585
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:21,830
Had a little help.

586
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,160
I know. Isn't it amazing?

587
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,990
This day just keeps
getting better and better.

588
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,260
Yeah for you.

589
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,300
I know right?

00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:30,060

593
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,300
Can we just do this experiment?

594
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:34,700
We both need extra credit.

595
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,900
Nah.

596
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,870
I'll just give the teacher some
strappy sandals and a pashmina.

597
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,840
No. Just give it a rest.

598
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:44,010
What's wrong with you?

599
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,640
I don't know.
This whole wish thing.

600
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,340
You're changing too fast Abby.

601
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,680
I can't keep up.

602
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,010
What do you mean?

603
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:52,820
You've always been
allergic to volunteer work.

604
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:54,950
And now all of a sudden
you're Student Body President?

605
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,220
What can I say?

606
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:59,220
The people spoke
and they wanted me.

607
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:02,960
The candles spoke and you have no
idea what you just wished for.

608
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:04,190
Yes I do.

609
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:07,660
Being president
is like an honor.

610
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:10,330
Being president is
an important job Abby.

611
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,300
It should do to someone
who really wants it.

612
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:15,300
Oh like who? Like Krista?

613
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:16,330
No.

614
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,800
Well I'm sure
I'll do just fine.

615
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,840
I'll have you to help me.

616
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:24,140
Come on.
You can't be mad at me.

617
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:25,270
Why not?

618
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:27,380
Because it's my birthday.

619
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:31,280
Because we're best friends.

620
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:39,550
Because I'm Student Body President
and I get free lunch. Ta-da!

621
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,690
No way.

622
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,190
Way way. Every day.

623
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:47,030
Now hand over
your goofy glasses

624
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:50,100
and let your commander in chief
buy you a sandwich.

625
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:52,600
What kind of sandwich?

626
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,940
Any kind you want.

627
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,810
Come on.

628
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:04,680
There she is!

629
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:09,490
You see? Ha ha.
They love me.

630
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,190
What have you done now?

631
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,390
Wish number 10.

632
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:17,460
I looked in the mirror and I
was tired of being invisible.

633
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:20,160
When I'm 16 I'll be popular.

634
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,730
Oh hi Joey.

635
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,100
Abby smile!

636
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:26,060
Sure I'll sign it.

637
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:30,700
I loved that wish.

638
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,200
Right.

639
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:39,210
Okay people make a hole!

640
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,370
Here she comes!

641
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:41,440
Back up. Come on.

642
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,040
Move your hair.
Thank you. Okay.

643
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,240
Peeps.

644
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:49,180
And I don't have to do a thing.

645
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,420
Just show up.

646
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:52,550
They're planning
your birthday party.

647
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:54,020
Mm-hmm.

648
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,620
Their dads
are business partners.

649
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,660
Apparently
they own half of Vegas.

650
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:02,560
They're throwing my party
at one of their hotels.

651
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,490
Not to rain on your birthday
parade Abs but Vegas?

652
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:09,830
That's not really your style.

653
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,430
And your basement is?

654
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,260
Hey I have foosball.

655
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,530
Good point.

656
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:19,070
Look this is my one and only
Sweet 16 birthday party.

657
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,610
I... I want it to be
spectacular.

658
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,720
I don't have anything to wear.

659
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,590
Well we both have
a free period right now.

660
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,520
Let's go buy you a dress.

661
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:33,420
We can't. The wasps are holding
my party money hostage.

662
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,630
I'll supply you the cash.

663
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,290
You'd do that?

664
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:37,430
Sure.

665
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,730
Jay you're the best.

666
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,940
We can't go.

667
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:58,180
I don't have my license yet.

668
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:03,850
A reading from the Wish List
of Abigail Jensen.

669
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,820
Wish number 7... When I'm 16...

670
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,950
Abigail Louise Jensen?

671
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,420
Yes.

672
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:39,450
This is highly unusual.

673
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,130
My driver's license!

674
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,330
And there ya go.

675
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,060
Thank you so much!

676
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:01,340
Oh lighten up Harry.

677
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:04,210
You needed to get out of
that cubicle anyway.

678
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,980
But we really don't
do this kind of thing.

679
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,240
I know.

680
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,680
But wasn't it fun?

681
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:11,980
My cubicle was fun.

687
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:43,110
This is now officially
the best 16th birthday

688
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:46,450
in the history
of 16th birthdays.

689
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,920
Abby you can't afford
a hanger here.

690
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,250
Not true.

691
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:53,790
Since I don't have
to pay for my own party

692
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:56,350
I'm spending every penny I
saved on the perfect dress.

693
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,620
Come on!

694
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,460
What do you think?
It's nice.

695
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:12,240
No. Too disco.

696
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:23,780
What about this one?

697
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:28,120
You're... It's beautiful.

698
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:30,690
But do you think Logan
will like it?

699
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,250
How should I know?

700
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:33,360
Touchy.

701
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:34,990
Why don't you just light
No. 16 right now

702
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,420
and make the stupid wish?

703
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:38,090
Poof.
Logan Buchanan is yours.

704
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:39,060
It doesn't work that way.

705
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:40,360
Uh yes it does.

706
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,060
It's worked that way all day.

707
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,230
I want Logan to like me for me

708
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:48,200
not because I put some magic
birthday spell on him.

709
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:49,600
I'm trying this on.

710
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:53,770
And these.

711
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,690
I'll take these.

712
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,660
I really feel for you.

713
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:22,990
Wasting your time on kids
like that.

714
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:24,230
A customer's a customer.

715
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,330
Oh trust me.

716
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:30,060
They won't be buying anything.

717
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,770
Look Jay.
It's perfect isn't it?

718
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,370
Sure.

719
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,440
Well I love it and I think
Logan's going to love it too.

720
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:39,140
Good. Sold.

721
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:41,010
Can we go now?

722
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,740
Don't be so grumpy.

723
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:44,880
I'm sorry.

724
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:46,980
This is a store
not a playground.

725
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,650
Exactly.

726
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:49,750
I like this one.

727
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,020
I'm sure you do.

728
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:53,260
Why don't you kids just come
back with your parents?

729
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:55,560
We're not kids. I'm 16.

730
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:56,930
Congratulations.

731
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,990
Now give me the dress.

732
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:59,930
No we're buying it!

733
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,970
Jay show her your money.

734
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:09,270
My wallet... You out.

735
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:11,410
Hey!
You can't do that!

736
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,880
Watch me.

737
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,710
But we're customers!

738
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:17,110
No you're children.

739
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:19,780
Get that dress off now.

740
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,770
Wish number 9...

741
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:57,490
When I'm 16 people will
stop treating me like a kid.

742
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:12,200
When I'm 16 people will stop
treating me like a kid.

743
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:30,620
Um excuse me where's my friend?

744
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:32,420
There was a boy here

745
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:35,190
but he left with a girl in
the cutest little yellow car...

746
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:37,850
Wait. He left with Krista?

747
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:39,560
It appears so.

748
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:42,630
Turn around.

749
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,090
That outfit is all wrong.

750
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:45,760
It's far too young for you.

751
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,560
And suddenly really tight.

752
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:51,230
Let's get you into something
more age appropriate.

753
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:54,670
Let's try these.

754
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:57,440
But I don't have any money.

755
00:43:57,470 --> 00:44:00,940
Oh we'll just put them
on your charge account.

756
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:05,080
I have a charge account?

757
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:06,780
Is everything all right
Miss Jensen?

758
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,050
Oh yeah.

759
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:12,350
Everything is just fine.

Do we know each other?

775
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:01,910
Yeah.

776
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:03,650
Ah you're the new
substitute teacher

777
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,580
which means I don't have to
babysit those little monsters.

778
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,720
They're all yours.

779
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:28,700
Psssst!

780
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:43,720
Psssst! Jay!

781
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:52,230
I'll be right back.

782
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:53,830
Oh great.

783
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:55,800
Leave me to wrangle
the Blob all alone.

784
00:45:57,430 --> 00:45:59,070
Okay go.

785
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:07,410
Yes?

786
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,510
Get out here!

787
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,580
What's wrong with you?

788
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:13,980
Excuse me?

789
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:16,820
You left me stranded
on my birthday.

790
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:18,850
What kind of a best friend
does that?

791
00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:21,290
Best friend?
What are you talking about?

792
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,990
Oh hi.
My name is Abby Jensen.

793
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:24,960
Have we met?

794
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:27,490
Yeah.
A long time ago I think.

795
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:28,490
Shut up.

796
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:30,130
Stop it.

797
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,100
I'm not your best friend.

798
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:36,370
I'm a sophomore.
You're a... woman.

799
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,000
Thank you but I'm just
four months older than you.

800
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,040
Yeah in dog years.

801
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:43,710
Listen I'm in the middle of
an important experiment...

802
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:45,680
And I'm in the middle of
an important birthday!

803
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:47,050
I'm sorry. I gotta go.

804
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:50,780
No wait... Let go.

805
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:56,220
Jay Kepler!

806
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:58,320
You're the worst
best friend ever!

807
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:01,360
I don't understand.

808
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:03,390
Am I being expelled?

809
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:06,700
I'm sure they'll
explain everything.

810
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:08,500
Mom? Dad?

811
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:10,230
What's the truck for?

812
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:12,240
Are we moving?

813
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:13,540
Just come with us.

814
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:15,710
Not until somebody tells me
what's going on?

815
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,010
Abby you can't go to
high school anymore.

816
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:22,410
What? Why not?

817
00:47:22,450 --> 00:47:23,580
Because it's time you grow up.

818
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:24,880
Bob.
What?

819
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,250
Sweetheart while the
house is being fumigated

820
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:27,590
there just really
isn't room for you.

821
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:30,590
So your dad and I were talking...
We found you an apartment...

822
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:31,890
A what?

823
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,030
An apartment.

824
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:34,760
To live in.

825
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:36,430
By myself?

826
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:50,610
It's a very safe neighborhood.

827
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:51,780
Is that what you call it?

828
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:53,210
I call it pricey.

829
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,110
Your dad and I paid
the security deposit

830
00:47:55,150 --> 00:47:57,880
but the first month's rent
is your responsibility.

831
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:07,020
Okay I'll get the last load.

832
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:08,390
You're going to need
a full-time job.

833
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:09,690
I circled some good ones...

834
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:12,630
What? No. I can't go
to school and have a job.

835
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:15,160
Oh well if you're ready
for college... Bob!

836
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,430
Yeah!

837
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:17,470
She wants to go to college!

838
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:18,900
No not yet!

839
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:19,870
Never mind.

840
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:20,970
Okay.

841
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,600
Mom I'm just a kid!

842
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,300
I can't live here by myself!

843
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:25,610
Abby don't be so dramatic.

844
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,810
Lots of girls your age
have their own apartments.

845
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,140
I moved out when I was 18.

846
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:31,340
But I'm not 18.

847
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:32,510
No you're 21.

848
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:33,510
22 today.

849
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:35,350
Happy Birthday sweetheart.

850
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:37,120
What are you talking about?

851
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:38,450
Let's go Sue.

852
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:39,950
No! Don't go!

853
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:43,060
Just remember we did this out
of love... Yeah tough love.

854
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:45,120
Bob!

855
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,590
You'll be fine Pumpkin.

856
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:48,600
Dad Dad...

857
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:57,910
Mom...
Come and visit anytime.

858
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:59,210
Except Wednesdays.

859
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:01,480
Wednesday is our bowling night.

860
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:13,690
High school memories?

861
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:43,080
No.

862
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:44,150
When I'm 16...

863
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:52,450
Let's get you into something
more age-appropriate.

864
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:53,750
You're the new substitute
teacher.

865
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:55,490
Stop it!
I'm not your best friend.

866
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:56,360
I'm a sophomore.

867
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:59,320
You're a...
woman.

868
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,390
No you're 21.

869
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:02,090
22 today.

870
00:50:02,130 --> 00:50:04,830
Happy Birthday sweetheart.

871
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:06,030
Oh no.

872
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:07,300
No no no.

873
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:09,470
This isn't what I wanted!

874
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:20,440
Celeste!

875
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:23,940
Celeste I need to talk to you!

876
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:26,150
Right now!

877
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:30,950
The list.

878
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:37,520
There's gotta be a wish.

879
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:40,260
That's it! Wish number 3.

880
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:42,120
That should do it.

881
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:50,700
When I'm 16 I'll decorate
my room the way I want.

882
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,200
Yoo-hoo!

883
00:50:57,670 --> 00:50:58,910
Decorator's Delight!

884
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:02,140
Celeste!
I'm so glad you're here... Me too.

885
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:04,080
Okay. Nice.

886
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:06,150
Lots of potential.

887
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:07,850
I need your help.
You sure do.

888
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,380
Maybe some wallpaper...
No no wallpaper.

889
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:11,880
Paint then.

890
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:12,880
Let's look at some samples.

891
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,020
No listen to me.

892
00:51:14,050 --> 00:51:15,750
Your magic candles
made a mistake.

893
00:51:15,790 --> 00:51:16,920
Candles don't make mistakes.

894
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:18,590
People do.

895
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:21,490
I made a wish but it
wasn't really my wish.

896
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,290
How about some curtains?

897
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:24,430
No!

898
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:25,530
Oo bad decision.

899
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:26,560
You need privacy.

900
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:27,390
You're alone.

901
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:29,600
You're a woman... No I'm not!

902
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:30,560
I'm not a woman!

903
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:31,930
I'm 16 years old!

904
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:36,770
I made a wish... wish number 9.

905
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,040
I didn't want to be an adult!

906
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:40,540
I just wanted to be
treated like one!

907
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:42,110
The candles have
their own logic.

908
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,380
They don't always give you
what you want.

909
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:44,910
Sometimes they give you
what you need.

910
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:47,880
And sweetie
you need drapes pronto.

911
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:49,850
I don't need drapes!

912
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,550
I need my life back!

913
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:52,750
I just wished away my friends

914
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:55,390
my Sweet 16 party
my senior prom...

915
00:51:57,260 --> 00:51:59,920
I missed graduation!

916
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,690
I need to take that wish back!

917
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:04,690
Oh sweetie.

918
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:06,830
I'm afraid that's not possible.

919
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:09,400
The candles and your
wishes go together.

920
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:12,030
Since there's no do-over
wish on your list...

921
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:15,570
I'm afraid when midnight
comes this is your life.

922
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:18,870
But...

923
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:23,140
Decorator's Delight.

924
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:24,880
Uh-huh.

925
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:26,280
On my way.

926
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:27,380
Slipcover emergency.

927
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:28,580
Gotta run.

928
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:31,380
What? No no no!

929
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:33,620
Wait!

930
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:37,560
Celeste Celeste...

931
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:44,500
You tryin' to run out
on the rent?

932
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:46,100
No!
Good.

933
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:47,800
First month is due
in three days.

934
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:49,200
Pay up or move out.

935
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,740
Move out.

936
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,540
Move out.

937
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:08,380
Stupid wishes!

938
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:10,920
Why did I ever write you down!

939
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:19,930
I'll just change one.

940
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,050
Ha!

941
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:49,550
Gotcha!

942
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:02,100
I hate sushi and I always will!

943
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,710
Hey...

944
00:54:13,010 --> 00:54:17,010
What about you
Wish No. 14?

945
00:54:17,050 --> 00:54:18,180
When I'm 16...

946
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:23,790
There you are sweetheart.

947
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:25,390
Mom don't you ever knock?

948
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:26,590
I need privacy.

949
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:27,620
What?

950
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:30,020
I need privacy.

951
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:31,160
Hold on a minute.

952
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:33,090
Bob come here a minute.

953
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,590
Tell your dad.

954
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:36,430
I need privacy.

955
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:37,560
One more time.

956
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,060
I need privacy.
I need privacy.

957
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:40,900
I don't understand a word
she's saying. Do you?

958
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:43,000
No. Then again I never do.

959
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,070
This has to work.

960
00:55:07,450 --> 00:55:09,250
Please understand.

961
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:22,970
Abby!
Hi Daddy.

962
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,170
Honey look who it is.

963
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,270
Hello sweetheart.
Hi Mom.

964
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:30,140
Shouldn't you be at your own
place unpacking those boxes?

965
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:32,810
Yeah but I missed you guys.

966
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:34,410
Aw that's sweet.

967
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:36,140
But we're kind
of busy right now.

968
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:37,550
Your turn dear.

969
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:38,850
What's the use?

970
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,680
22 cards in my hand
and I still can't play!

971
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:45,920
Can't this wait?

972
00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:48,190
Of course it can.

973
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:49,890
What's up?

974
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:54,960
Well um...

975
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:59,270
I have something
important to discuss with you

976
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:06,940
and I thought if you really listen
to me you might understand.

977
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:10,740
Bob.

978
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:13,050
What? I'm listening.

979
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:15,150
We're listening.

980
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:16,480
Even if it sounds crazy?

981
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:18,750
I listen to your father
all the time.

982
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:19,750
What's that supposed to mean?

983
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:21,320
Go on sweetheart.

984
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:29,330
When I woke up this morning
I was 16 years old.

985
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:35,830
I thought this was going to be
the best day of my life.

986
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:41,770
Then this Birthday Fairy
appeared and gave me these.

987
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:48,880
Would you look at this hon.

988
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:51,580
Well that brings back
memories doesn't it?

989
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:53,690
What?
What memories?

990
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:56,390
Your father took me to the
Lucky Duck Chinese Restaurant

991
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:58,360
on the night you were born.

992
00:56:58,390 --> 00:57:00,190
I had the orange chicken.

993
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:01,190
We thought it was an omen.

994
00:57:01,230 --> 00:57:03,230
We always felt so lucky

995
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:06,400
to have a daughter as
wonderful as you are.

996
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:07,530
Really?

997
00:57:07,570 --> 00:57:09,330
Really.

998
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:16,410
Then you'll understand when
I say I need to come back

999
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,610
and live with you
and go back to school..

1000
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,950
I'm not ready to have my own
apartment and my own job.

1001
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,950
Please tell me you understand.

1002
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:29,490
Abby look behind you.

1003
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:30,890
Ever since you were
a little girl

1004
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:35,060
all you wanted was to be
exactly what you are now.

1005
00:57:35,090 --> 00:57:39,800
Beautiful and independent.

1006
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:42,100
I remember the day
this photo was taken.

1007
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:44,940
You wanted a grown-up
birthday party.

1008
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:49,180
All dressed up in my
high heels and pearls.

1009
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:50,710
You were never happier.

1010
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:55,550
But being grown up is different
than dreaming about it isn't it?

1011
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:58,250
Yes.

1012
00:57:58,290 --> 00:58:00,150
We understand you.

1013
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:01,820
You do?

1014
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:03,260
Of course.

1015
00:58:03,290 --> 00:58:04,860
You're scared your childhood
is over and with it

1016
00:58:04,890 --> 00:58:08,090
all the best times of your life.
Yes!

1017
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:09,900
You probably want to just turn
back the clock and start over.

1018
00:58:09,930 --> 00:58:10,960
Yes! Yes!

1019
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,400
That's exactly
what I want to do!

1020
00:58:12,430 --> 00:58:15,700
We know how that feels.

1021
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:18,870
Then I'm still your
little girl?

1022
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:21,510
You'll always be our
little girl Pumpkin...

1023
00:58:31,890 --> 00:58:33,550
Look! Wasps!

1024
00:58:33,590 --> 00:58:34,490
Time to go Pumpkin.

1025
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:36,320
Drive safe.

1026
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:37,990
And don't forget these.

1027
00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:40,460
But I thought you
guys understood.

1028
00:58:40,490 --> 00:58:42,700
We do understand Adulthood
could be tough.

1029
00:58:42,730 --> 00:58:44,560
Sometimes it gets
a little buggy.

1030
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,600
Bye now sweetheart!

1031
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,240
Love you!

1032
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:57,780
So that's what that feels like.

1033
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:27,370
Hi Logan.

1034
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:28,510
Hey.

1035
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:29,780
Cool ride.

1036
00:59:29,810 --> 00:59:32,480
Yeah you said that
this morning.

1037
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:34,110
Huh?

1038
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:38,320
So...what are you
doing here?

1039
00:59:38,350 --> 00:59:40,050
Party.

1040
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:41,890
Right.

1041
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:46,660
I wasn't invited.

1042
00:59:46,690 --> 00:59:47,860
Huh.

1043
00:59:53,330 --> 00:59:55,130
Hey!
Yeah?

1044
00:59:55,170 --> 00:59:57,200
Will you do something for me?
Sure.

1045
00:59:57,240 --> 01:00:00,040
Take a picture of me
with your car.

1046
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:02,480
Okay.

1047
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:03,780
Thanks.

1048
01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:05,580
It's what I want
when I'm your age.

1049
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:10,980
There ya go.

1050
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:12,420
Cool.

1051
01:00:14,190 --> 01:00:16,860
Oh man that's hot.

1052
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:18,690
I can't wait to show Krista!

1053
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,680
Joey Lockhart!

1054
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:41,580
Get off of me!

1055
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:43,050
Get off!

1056
01:00:43,090 --> 01:00:44,520
You have to believe me Jay.

1057
01:00:44,550 --> 01:00:45,890
You're my best friend and
it's my 16th birthday

1058
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:47,990
and I got these magic
candles at the bus stop

1059
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:50,420
and this big car pulled up
and Joey Lockhart got out

1060
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:55,430
and kissed me... I don't know her.

1061
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:57,330
You were there!
You saw him!

1062
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:58,900
Let go.

1063
01:00:58,930 --> 01:01:02,230
Not until you listen to me.
Give me five minutes.

1064
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:07,740
Four.

1065
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:13,910
Okay.

1066
01:01:13,950 --> 01:01:16,250
I know this is hard to believe

1067
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:20,220
but we're best friends
and I can prove it.

1068
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:24,190
So?

1069
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:26,420
Look at your key ring.

1070
01:01:47,150 --> 01:01:50,280
"Happy Sweet 16. Love Jay."

1071
01:01:52,350 --> 01:01:54,190
You gave this to
me this morning.

1072
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:56,420
For my 16th birthday.

1073
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:10,260
Abby.

1074
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:12,270
You remember?

1075
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:14,200
I think so.

1076
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:17,170
So you believe me?

1077
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,340
Yeah.

1078
01:02:19,370 --> 01:02:20,740
I do.

1079
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:32,750
He believes me!

1080
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:33,980
Whoa.

1081
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:35,390
Volume.

1082
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:42,690
This doesn't change anything.

1083
01:02:42,730 --> 01:02:47,600
And when midnight comes
I'm stuck like this forever.

1084
01:02:54,870 --> 01:02:57,200
Here lemme see the list.

1085
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:00,100
Here ya go.

1086
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:09,480
Okay you've used 1 2
7 8 9... Skip ahead.

1087
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,420
I can't believe
you wasted a wish on sushi.

1088
01:03:11,450 --> 01:03:13,050
I was 8.

1089
01:03:13,090 --> 01:03:15,520
I had a very
unsophisticated palate.

1090
01:03:15,550 --> 01:03:17,120
Had?

1091
01:03:23,330 --> 01:03:26,330
You're a great best friend Jay.

1092
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:29,830
I know.

1093
01:03:29,870 --> 01:03:31,070
C'mon.

1094
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:34,270
Most of these are
kind of useless

1095
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:36,970
since you're already an adult.

1096
01:03:37,010 --> 01:03:44,410
That leaves 15 and Logan
Buchanan... Yeah about that...

1097
01:03:44,450 --> 01:03:47,380
15 was always my favorite.

1098
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:52,020
"When I'm 16 I'll have
the best party ever."

1099
01:03:56,360 --> 01:04:00,030
But you're not 16 anymore.

1100
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:13,870
Hey.

1101
01:04:13,910 --> 01:04:17,610
I kinda have to make an
appearance at Krista's party.

1102
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:21,180
Do you maybe want to come
with me?

1103
01:04:23,850 --> 01:04:25,220
Not as my date or anything.

1104
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:26,590
No.

1105
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:29,390
Of course not.

1106
01:04:29,430 --> 01:04:31,030
Well?

1107
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:37,400
I'd love to go with you Jay.

1108
01:04:39,570 --> 01:04:41,370
Okay.

1109
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:54,310
Sync by Hana.Bean
www.Addic7ed.Com

1110
01:04:58,280 --> 01:04:59,780
Great party.

1111
01:04:59,810 --> 01:05:01,850
Ladies first.

1112
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:15,860
Mike?

1113
01:05:15,890 --> 01:05:17,960
Give a shout-out to my
big sis Abby everybody.

1114
01:05:21,890 --> 01:05:24,160
You're super old Abs
but you're still cool!

1115
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:26,100
So Mike can really play?

1116
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:27,300
Yeah.

1117
01:05:27,330 --> 01:05:28,960
Something just clicked
with him this year.

1118
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,900
He got serious about
playing guitar.

1119
01:05:30,930 --> 01:05:33,100
He's getting paid really
well for this gig.

1120
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:39,670
Wait.

1121
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:40,870
Did I miss something?

1122
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:43,070
I mean besides senior year?

1123
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:45,670
Jay you're here!

1124
01:05:45,710 --> 01:05:48,310
Hi! I'm so glad
you could make it!

1125
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:49,870
Yeah.

1126
01:05:49,910 --> 01:05:52,810
I'm...Abby Jensen.

1127
01:05:52,850 --> 01:05:54,110
I know silly.

1128
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:56,110
We're neighbors?

1129
01:05:56,150 --> 01:05:59,020
Yes.
Neighbors.

1130
01:05:59,050 --> 01:06:00,550
Your party looks awesome.

1131
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:02,550
Thanks to your parents.

1132
01:06:02,590 --> 01:06:04,650
They found all these amazing
decorations in their garage

1133
01:06:04,690 --> 01:06:06,820
after their house
was infested by wasps.

1134
01:06:06,860 --> 01:06:09,890
I guess they were left over
from your Sweet 16 Party

1135
01:06:09,930 --> 01:06:11,860
but never got used
for some reason.

1136
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:13,970
So they just gave them to me!

1137
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,070
Lucky you.

1138
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:17,170
I know right?

1139
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:20,470
And you're just in time
for the big celebration.

1140
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:24,180
Thanks for coming everybody!

1141
01:06:28,850 --> 01:06:30,790
Man this is a dream
come true for me.

1142
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:33,620
What's happening?

1143
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:34,760
Jay Kepler
ladies and gentlemen.

1144
01:06:34,790 --> 01:06:36,990
Our new Student Body President!

1145
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:43,930
Thank you.

1146
01:06:43,970 --> 01:06:46,330
I want to recognize my campaign
manager Krista Cook.

1147
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:51,970
What all of you don't know is
that I really wanted this

1148
01:06:52,010 --> 01:06:54,640
but I was too afraid to try.

1149
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:56,180
I couldn't have done it
without your help Krista.

1150
01:06:58,010 --> 01:07:00,910
Thank you so much!

1151
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:04,820
1 2 3 4...
Have fun okay? Mm-hmm.

1152
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:13,660
So you're Student Body
President?

1153
01:07:13,690 --> 01:07:14,990
Yep.

1154
01:07:15,030 --> 01:07:17,900
I was Student Body President.

1155
01:07:17,930 --> 01:07:19,260
Oh yeah.

1156
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:20,600
Weird.

1157
01:07:20,630 --> 01:07:23,300
I thought with me out of the
way Krista would win for sure.

1158
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:24,900
Krista?

1159
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:27,300
She's hates competition.

1160
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:28,400
Krista?

1161
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:29,640
Our Krista.

1162
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:30,740
Yeah.

1163
01:07:30,770 --> 01:07:32,510
I think without you in her life

1164
01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:35,610
she just didn't have a reason
to compete for anything.

1165
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:39,740
She's kind super helpful a good
listener and a great friend.

1166
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:41,950
You guys would like each other.

1167
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:44,820

Large pepperoni pineapple
for Jensen.

1217
01:11:56,510 --> 01:11:58,180
I didn't order a pizza.

1218
01:11:58,210 --> 01:11:59,480
I know.

1219
01:11:59,510 --> 01:12:02,250
I just thought
you could use a friend.

1220
01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:06,720
Oh sweetie.

1221
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:11,720
Dry those tears.

1222
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:14,820
I'm starving.

1223
01:12:14,860 --> 01:12:16,260
You are?

1224
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:19,730
Sure us magical beings
have to eat too.

1225
01:12:21,130 --> 01:12:23,030
This day didn't go
like I thought it would.

1226
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:24,730
I can't believe I wasted
my wishes on things

1227
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:26,100
like beating Krista Cook.

1228
01:12:26,130 --> 01:12:27,630
Yeah.

1229
01:12:27,670 --> 01:12:30,900
She's pretty nice now that she
is not out to destroy you.

1230
01:12:30,940 --> 01:12:32,140
Don't rub it in.

1231
01:12:32,170 --> 01:12:34,270
She's a really good friend
to Jay.

1232
01:12:34,310 --> 01:12:35,940
Better than I was.

1233
01:12:35,970 --> 01:12:38,540
I didn't even know he wanted
to be Student Body President.

1234
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:40,880
How could I have been
so thoughtless?

1235
01:12:42,510 --> 01:12:43,780
All I could think about

1236
01:12:43,810 --> 01:12:48,620
was having parties and
clothes and popularity.

1237
01:12:48,650 --> 01:12:51,880
I can't believe those things
were so important to me.

1238
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:53,550
You were 16.

1239
01:12:53,590 --> 01:12:55,490
But I didn't appreciate it.

1240
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:58,190
Ever since I was little
I wanted to grow up.

1241
01:12:58,220 --> 01:13:02,660
I thought it was the only way
to get what I wanted.

1242
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:06,060
I guess I didn't realize
what I already had.

1243
01:13:18,010 --> 01:13:20,510
You still have
this little number.

1244
01:13:26,250 --> 01:13:28,290
Wish 16.

1245
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:31,590
All those years I saved it
for something really special.

1246
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:36,560
Of all the wishes on this list

1247
01:13:36,590 --> 01:13:39,960
this is the one
I wish I could change.

1248
01:13:53,510 --> 01:13:55,510
Wow that gum is still
really fresh.

1249
01:14:10,350 --> 01:14:10,390
Maybe the rules
don't know about gum.

1250
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:14,760
There's only one way
to find out.

1251
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:45,520
I wish I could start
this whole day over again.

1252
01:14:50,790 --> 01:14:51,960
Surprise!

1253
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:58,070
Happy Birthday Abby.

1254
01:14:58,100 --> 01:14:59,130
Look.

1255
01:14:59,170 --> 01:15:01,170
Your first 16th
birthday picture.

1256
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:08,280
This is a great picture!

1257
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:11,010
This is the best picture I've
ever seen in my entire life!

1258
01:15:11,050 --> 01:15:12,710
Thank you thank you thank you!

1259
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:14,620
You're welcome Pumpkin.

1260
01:15:16,150 --> 01:15:18,320
Make a wish sweetheart?

1261
01:15:18,350 --> 01:15:21,490
I wish for exactly this.

1262
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:24,420
Everything is perfect.

1263
01:15:28,730 --> 01:15:30,160
Wasps!

1264
01:15:31,230 --> 01:15:32,230
Yeah.

1265
01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:36,530
I saw one crawl up the AC vent.

1266
01:15:36,570 --> 01:15:37,940
No not one. Thousands!

1267
01:15:37,970 --> 01:15:40,600
Nesting up there for 16 years!

1268
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:42,440
Sweetheart we know.

1269
01:15:42,470 --> 01:15:44,140
No you don't know.
You can't possibly know

1270
01:15:44,170 --> 01:15:45,740
that the house is going
to be totally infested

1271
01:15:45,780 --> 01:15:47,310
and the wasps will
take over the cars

1272
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:49,480
and you and Dad'll have
to live in the driveway

1273
01:15:49,510 --> 01:15:51,350
but then Joey Lockhart
will come and kiss me

1274
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:52,780
and I will get candles
and wishes

1275
01:15:52,820 --> 01:15:54,750
and some really
gorgeous clothes

1276
01:15:54,790 --> 01:15:57,490
and everything will look
like it will be okay.

1277
01:15:57,530 --> 01:15:58,860
But then I will make
a really stupid wish

1278
01:15:58,890 --> 01:16:00,330
that I didn't mean to make

1279
01:16:00,370 --> 01:16:02,670
and I will have to grow up and
live alone and miss my party

1280
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:04,230
and this will turn into
the worst 16th birthday

1281
01:16:04,270 --> 01:16:05,870
in the history of
16th birthdays!

1282
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:08,610
You have to call
the exterminator now!

1283
01:16:12,140 --> 01:16:13,580
Okey dokey.

1284
01:16:13,610 --> 01:16:14,950
All done.

1285
01:16:14,980 --> 01:16:17,880
Whoo that was some wasps' nest.

1286
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:19,020
Celeste?

1287
01:16:19,050 --> 01:16:20,080
Hi Abby.

1288
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:21,350
You know her.

1289
01:16:21,390 --> 01:16:24,190
Yeah we just met this morning.

1290
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:27,830
When Abby called me.
You're very lucky I showed up when I did.

1291
01:16:27,860 --> 01:16:30,960
So the wasps are all gone.

1292
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,800
Like they never happened.

1293
01:16:33,830 --> 01:16:36,030
Everything is going to be okay?

1294
01:16:36,070 --> 01:16:38,400
Better than okay.

1295
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:40,440
Wait.
What do I owe ya?

1296
01:16:40,470 --> 01:16:42,640
Consider it a Sweet 16 gift.

1297
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:44,910
Happy Birthday Abby.

1298
01:16:44,940 --> 01:16:46,180
Thank you.

1299
01:16:46,210 --> 01:16:48,710
For everything.

1300
01:16:53,890 --> 01:16:56,920
Go on down and start making that
special birthday breakfast

1301
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:58,090
you have planned for me Mom.

1302
01:16:58,120 --> 01:16:59,520
I'll be right there.

1303
01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:28,790
♪ Da na na da na na now! ♪

1304
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:34,060
♪ Da na na da na na now! ♪

1305
01:17:34,090 --> 01:17:35,190
Hey!

1306
01:17:35,230 --> 01:17:36,330
This is for you.

1307
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:38,230
I was saving it
for my Sweet 16 party

1308
01:17:38,260 --> 01:17:41,600
but I think you need it more.

1309
01:17:41,630 --> 01:17:42,530
Whoa!

1310
01:17:42,570 --> 01:17:44,840
For what?

1311
01:17:44,870 --> 01:17:46,270
A real guitar.

1312
01:17:46,310 --> 01:17:48,940
I think you're really talented.

1313
01:17:53,310 --> 01:17:54,780
Thank you Abs.

1314
01:17:56,150 --> 01:17:57,480
I love you Mike.

1315
01:18:00,690 --> 01:18:03,090
Thanks for the yummy
breakfast Mom and Dad.

1316
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:05,420
Love you!

1317
01:18:08,130 --> 01:18:10,430
Love you too.

1318
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:13,030
Krista! Krista! Wait!

1319
01:18:13,070 --> 01:18:13,970
Get back.

1320
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,430
We need to talk.

1321
01:18:15,470 --> 01:18:18,140
I have nothing to say to you.

1322
01:18:18,170 --> 01:18:20,370
I have one quick question.

1323
01:18:20,410 --> 01:18:22,780
No you cannot have a ride.

1324
01:18:22,810 --> 01:18:24,680
I don't want a ride.

1325
01:18:24,710 --> 01:18:27,450
I want to understand.

1326
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:29,450
What did I ever do to you?

1327
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:31,220
Go away.

1328
01:18:31,250 --> 01:18:32,520
No.

1329
01:18:32,550 --> 01:18:35,490
Not until you answer me.

1330
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:37,160
Why don't you like me?

1331
01:18:40,060 --> 01:18:42,160
You really don't know do you?

1332
01:18:42,190 --> 01:18:45,160
Not a clue.

1333
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:54,270
It was in third grade.

1334
01:18:54,310 --> 01:18:57,010
Jay and I were best friends.

1335
01:18:57,040 --> 01:19:00,580
Then you moved to town.

1336
01:19:00,610 --> 01:19:03,510
It was my birthday.

1337
01:19:03,550 --> 01:19:06,320
Jay and I made a pact...

1338
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:12,490
Cheese!

1339
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:13,720
Best friends forever!

1340
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:15,590
Yeah!

1341
01:19:25,470 --> 01:19:26,630
I stole your best friend.

1342
01:19:26,670 --> 01:19:29,640
On my birthday.

1343
01:19:29,670 --> 01:19:33,040
After that Jay and I
did everything together.

1344
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:34,910
Without me.

1345
01:19:34,940 --> 01:19:37,340
That must have been
so horrible for you.

1346
01:19:37,380 --> 01:19:39,410
It was.

1347
01:19:39,450 --> 01:19:41,680
I can't imagine how you felt.

1348
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:43,850
How I felt?

1349
01:19:43,890 --> 01:19:47,760
I felt like a loser.

1350
01:19:49,290 --> 01:19:53,490
Krista if I could turn back
the clock and change that day

1351
01:19:53,530 --> 01:19:55,200
I would.

1352
01:19:57,170 --> 01:20:00,200
I am so sorry.

1353
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:03,240
You are?

1354
01:20:06,010 --> 01:20:08,240
Any chance you can forgive me?

1355
01:20:09,580 --> 01:20:11,410
I don't know.

1356
01:20:11,450 --> 01:20:13,880
I made my own vow that day.

1357
01:20:13,910 --> 01:20:18,420
Which was...
I vowed to win at everything

1358
01:20:18,450 --> 01:20:22,620
so you'd never get anything
you wanted ever again.

1359
01:20:22,660 --> 01:20:25,530
Wow.

1360
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:27,630
You did a great job.

1361
01:20:27,660 --> 01:20:30,130
Thank you.

1362
01:20:32,530 --> 01:20:37,440
Hey imagine if you used your
powers for good instead of evil.

1363
01:20:37,470 --> 01:20:39,670
Like what?

1364
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:43,010
Do you really want to be
Student Body President?

1365
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:44,640
Honestly?

1366
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:46,040
No.

1367
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:50,380
It's exhausting having
to win all the time.

1368
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:54,790
If you want to drop out

1369
01:20:54,820 --> 01:20:59,290
I know somebody who would
love to take your place.

1370
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:02,690
Hey Krista.

1371
01:21:02,730 --> 01:21:05,860
Hey Abby!

1372
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:08,030
Boys.

1373
01:21:08,070 --> 01:21:09,270
Cool ride!

1374
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:10,970
Thanks!

1375
01:21:12,740 --> 01:21:13,940
Weird.

1376
01:21:18,210 --> 01:21:19,950
You're a terrible best friend.

1377
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:21,580
No I'm not.
Yes you are.

1378
01:21:21,610 --> 01:21:24,050
I had to take the bus by myself.
Where were you?

1379
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:27,490
I got a ride.

1380
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:30,460
You two.
In one vehicle.

1381
01:21:30,490 --> 01:21:32,060
And it didn't like explode?

1382
01:21:32,090 --> 01:21:33,260
Nope.

1383
01:21:33,290 --> 01:21:35,360
We have a surprise for you.

1384
01:21:35,390 --> 01:21:36,530
Why? It's not my birthday.

1385
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:38,930
No it's mine...
And mine...

1386
01:21:38,970 --> 01:21:42,940
And all we want is for
your dream to come true.

1387
01:21:42,970 --> 01:21:44,400
What dream?

1388
01:21:46,470 --> 01:21:49,940
You're now the only person running
for Student Body President.

1389
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:52,410
So you'll win for sure.

1390
01:21:54,150 --> 01:21:55,110
Think so?

1391
01:21:55,150 --> 01:21:57,150
Absolutely.

1392
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:03,360
Jay Kepler
ladies and gentlemen.

1393
01:22:03,390 --> 01:22:06,330
Our new...
Student Body President!

1394
01:22:08,830 --> 01:22:10,400
Go Jay!

1395
01:22:10,430 --> 01:22:12,930
Thanks everybody.

1396
01:22:12,970 --> 01:22:14,670
Let's hear it for the hosts
of this little party

1397
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:16,400
Abby and Krista!

1398
01:22:21,010 --> 01:22:23,570
Happy Sweet 16
to the both of you

1400
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:40,230
Look who's here.
Huh?

1401
01:22:40,260 --> 01:22:41,330
Look!

1402
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:48,070
Logan Buchanan
he's so gorgeous!

1403
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:50,130
You really like him don't you?

1404
01:22:50,170 --> 01:22:51,370
Yeah.

1405
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:53,640
I thought you liked him
to make me suffer.

1406
01:22:53,670 --> 01:22:57,510
Making you suffer was a bonus but
I would have liked him anyway.

1407
01:22:58,940 --> 01:23:03,110
Well I happen to know
he really likes you too.

1408
01:23:04,420 --> 01:23:06,980
Really?
Really.

1409
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:08,790
Go talk to him.

1410
01:23:08,820 --> 01:23:10,290
About what?

1411
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:15,230
Ask him about the red sports
car he wants to drive someday.

1412
01:23:20,570 --> 01:23:22,400
Okay.

1413
01:23:25,310 --> 01:23:27,010
Hi Logan.

1414
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:29,240
Thanks a lot for coming.

1415
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:30,680
You look great.

1416
01:23:30,710 --> 01:23:32,110
You too.

1417
01:23:53,770 --> 01:23:55,330
Happy Birthday Abby.

1418
01:23:55,370 --> 01:23:57,670
Yes it is.

1419
01:23:57,700 --> 01:24:02,110
It is now officially
the best 16th birthday

1420
01:24:02,140 --> 01:24:04,640
in the history of
16th birthdays.

1421
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:05,850
Good.

1422
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:16,260
