00:00:55,197 --> 00:00:57,934
[Anna] Isaac Lemay
roamed the Great Plains

6
00:00:57,967 --> 00:01:01,904
in western territories,
taking up with whores

7
00:01:01,938 --> 00:01:04,539
and siring children
across the land

8
00:01:04,572 --> 00:01:06,574
without thought to consequence.

9
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,546
He gained employment clearing
Cheyenne for the army

10
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:13,883
and it was the
ugliness of this task

11
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:15,184
which turned him to ruin.

12
00:01:17,186 --> 00:01:20,156
For his crimes the Cheyenne
chief White Thunder

13
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:22,824
cursed him to be
killed by his own seed.

14
00:01:24,226 --> 00:01:28,730
Haunted, he tracked down
his children one by one

15
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:34,003
to kill them before they
did the same to him.

Lionel!

19
00:03:14,336 --> 00:03:17,106
Rumor is there's a
man from the plains

20
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:19,341
goin' around
killing his own kin.

21
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:25,281
Says he come back here to
wipe his seed from the earth.

22
00:03:28,918 --> 00:03:30,618
You heard this rumor?

23
00:03:37,893 --> 00:03:41,030
The man carries an
ivory handled Colt.

24
00:03:42,398 --> 00:03:44,200
Much like the one
you're carrying.

25
00:03:54,676 --> 00:03:59,681
Finish the whiskey and leave.

Go on, here.

Poor Lionel.

43
00:06:37,872 --> 00:06:38,974
He didn't deserve that.

44
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:44,280
Tell me about the twin.

45
00:06:48,384 --> 00:06:49,385
There is no twin.

Somebody kill that motherfucker!

55
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:12,267
Why don't you kill
yourself, Lemay!

56
00:08:12,301 --> 00:08:13,635
You're the devil!

57
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:17,139
- You're gonna do something?
- Come on, come on.

58
00:08:17,172 --> 00:08:18,907
You're gonna let him
get away with that!

59
00:08:18,941 --> 00:08:20,042
Are you really gonna let
him get away with that?

60
00:08:20,075 --> 00:08:22,244

Well, those days have passed.

74
00:09:52,568 --> 00:09:54,970
She'll be coming back
from church real soon now.

75

[Claire] She's not.

89
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:07,436
She got the mark on her neck?

90
00:12:07,469 --> 00:12:09,504
She doesn't have a mark.

91
00:12:12,207 --> 00:12:15,210
You know what I'm
gonna do to her?

92
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:20,148
There's rumors about you.

93
00:12:22,517 --> 00:12:23,352

You go to church?

[Claire] They say you've
been cursed by Cheyenne.

98
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:35,731
That you're to be killed
by the hand of your son.

99
00:12:40,202 --> 00:12:42,170
By my child?

100
00:12:42,204 --> 00:12:43,472
[Claire] She isn't yours.

101
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:47,509
She's never hurt a
thing in her life.

102
00:12:49,511 --> 00:12:50,379
Yeah?

103
00:12:53,749 --> 00:12:56,618

nothing like you.

00:12:59,889 --> 00:13:01,223
Yeah she is.

105
00:13:08,998 --> 00:13:10,866

Tell you something
you wanna know.

lies the plains.

116
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,003

I met your mama.

What?

124
00:17:21,483 --> 00:17:24,220

harm our daughter.

You're not the one
who's gonna kill me.

135

to my daughter?

Unwilling to raise
him in a brothel,

his mother abandoned him at the

00:24:45,594 --> 00:24:47,529
Oh, he's as innocent
as a newborn lamb.

189
00:24:51,266 --> 00:24:52,134
Hi.

190
00:24:55,471 --> 00:24:57,872
Now, why would you do that?

191
00:25:00,976 --> 00:25:02,378
[gun firing]

192
00:25:02,411 --> 00:25:06,949
[patrons chattering]
[patrons laughing]

193
00:25:11,053 --> 00:25:13,288
I like your name.

194
00:25:13,322 --> 00:25:14,423
Does the job.

195
00:25:14,456 --> 00:25:17,059
[tense music]

196
00:25:56,398 --> 00:25:58,066
[Cal] What happened?

197
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,369
[door thudding]

198
00:26:00,402 --> 00:26:02,004
You need to leave town.

199
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:05,107
Who did this?

200
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:09,077
Your father.

201
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:11,713
He's looking for you.

202
00:26:14,283 --> 00:26:15,150
What's he want?

203
00:26:19,388 --> 00:26:20,689
Brooks, Canada in a month.

204
00:26:21,623 --> 00:26:23,225
Just as we planned.

205
00:26:23,258 --> 00:26:24,226
Just we can't go
together anymore.

206
00:26:24,259 --> 00:26:25,761
I'll meet you there.

207
00:26:25,794 --> 00:26:26,762
Y'all finished?

208
00:26:26,795 --> 00:26:27,996
Fuck you. Get out.

209
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:31,266
[door slams]

210
00:26:43,345 --> 00:26:46,281
I want you to come
and live with me.

211
00:26:46,315 --> 00:26:47,416
I need to protect you.

212
00:26:48,817 --> 00:26:50,052
But I'm not the one
in need of protecting.

213
00:26:50,085 --> 00:26:52,020
I ain't scared of him.

214
00:26:52,054 --> 00:26:53,255
I ain't scared of no one.

215
00:26:56,658 --> 00:26:57,626
You go alone.

216
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,262
I'll meet you there.

217
00:27:05,701 --> 00:27:08,770
[dark ominous music]

218
00:27:19,548 --> 00:27:21,717
Why don't I stay here tonight?

219
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:22,618
You can't.

220
00:27:26,722 --> 00:27:30,192
[dark ominous music continues]

221
00:27:30,225 --> 00:27:35,230
What if I was a customer?

222
00:27:39,668 --> 00:27:42,404
Why you always want me to leave?

223
00:27:43,672 --> 00:27:45,474
Because I love you.

224
00:27:53,482 --> 00:27:55,350
What does that mean?

225
00:27:59,488 --> 00:28:01,223
What does that mean?

226
00:28:03,825 --> 00:28:07,095
[patrons chattering]

227
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,532
Think Cal got some.

228
00:28:10,566 --> 00:28:11,800
Sure looks like it.

229
00:28:11,833 --> 00:28:12,701
He looks worn.

230
00:28:13,802 --> 00:28:15,437
You with Anna?

231
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,272
Anna is one hell of
a whore, I tell you.

232
00:28:17,306 --> 00:28:18,840
One hell of a whore.

233
00:28:20,409 --> 00:28:24,813
[woman screaming]
[knife slicing]

234
00:28:29,818 --> 00:28:34,823
[knife thudding]
[women screaming]

235
00:29:13,963 --> 00:29:15,597
You want a cigarette?

236
00:29:20,268 --> 00:29:24,272
I'm such a fool for thinking
I could've been a mother.

237
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:26,909
Can't blame yourself.

238
00:29:29,478 --> 00:29:30,679
He wasn't always wrong.

239
00:29:31,613 --> 00:29:32,748
Not when he was little.

240
00:29:34,716 --> 00:29:36,318
I'm sure you done your best.

241
00:29:40,389 --> 00:29:41,657
I just wanna know why.

242
00:29:43,258 --> 00:29:44,660
[exhales] Why what?

243
00:29:47,562 --> 00:29:49,765
Why the devil
won't leave us alone?

244
00:30:03,478 --> 00:30:08,483
[wolf howling]
[fire crackling]

245
00:30:40,582 --> 00:30:43,385
[voices echoing]

246
00:31:21,389 --> 00:31:26,394
Is the curse over?

247
00:31:27,829 --> 00:31:30,832
[White Thunder]
It's not a curse.

248
00:31:30,866 --> 00:31:31,733
It's a prophecy.

249
00:31:32,935 --> 00:31:35,737
[fire crackling]

250
00:31:40,675 --> 00:31:43,612
[flames whooshing]

251
00:32:11,941 --> 00:32:14,576
[wind blowing]

252
00:32:21,416 --> 00:32:22,818
Some sort of game gun.

253
00:32:27,924 --> 00:32:29,992
Not your standard
Sharp's that's for sure.

254
00:32:31,493 --> 00:32:33,728
Shots done point
blank with a big gun.

255
00:32:36,065 --> 00:32:38,100
Them holes in
Wilson, that's a 45.

256
00:32:41,137 --> 00:32:42,004
No hurry.

257
00:32:43,072 --> 00:32:44,472
Walked straight up to these two.

258
00:32:44,506 --> 00:32:45,908
Boom. Boom.

259
00:32:45,942 --> 00:32:46,808
Three men.

260
00:32:48,878 --> 00:32:50,378
But only one shoots.

261
00:32:52,882 --> 00:32:54,917
Still can't believe
you grew up Indian.

262
00:32:56,685 --> 00:32:57,752
What'd they do to you?

263
00:33:00,122 --> 00:33:01,057
They raised me.

264
00:33:04,593 --> 00:33:06,428
It's a perfect
spot for an ambush.

265
00:33:07,163 --> 00:33:08,830
Not amateurs, then?

266
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,465
Not amateurs.

267
00:33:10,498 --> 00:33:14,703
Whoever did this
to my men, my men.

268
00:33:14,736 --> 00:33:17,106
Not telling what he'll
do with my Gatling gun.

269
00:33:17,139 --> 00:33:18,840
Criminal isn't trained.

270
00:33:18,874 --> 00:33:20,076
Won't be able to work it.

271
00:33:21,643 --> 00:33:24,046
You'd be surprised
at what people can do.

272
00:33:26,983 --> 00:33:29,919
[group chattering]

273
00:33:36,591 --> 00:33:38,460
That's the last of 'em.

274
00:33:38,493 --> 00:33:40,829
Every soldier trained on the
Gatling gun in the region.

275
00:33:42,198 --> 00:33:43,665
You want some kind
of help with these?

276
00:33:43,698 --> 00:33:44,666
Look at this.

277
00:33:44,699 --> 00:33:46,635
Name Cal Talisker.

278
00:33:46,668 --> 00:33:48,536
Raised as an orphan
in Virginia City.

279
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:52,507
Joined the army and trained as
a loader on the Gatling gun.

280
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:57,545
Discharged for lying about
his age and insubordination.

281
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,448
Look who his
superior officer was.

282
00:34:01,984 --> 00:34:02,851
Wilson.

283
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:08,790
Where you going?

284
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,727
Virginia City.

285
00:34:15,797 --> 00:34:18,466
[wind blowing]

286
00:34:34,549 --> 00:34:35,550
The devil,

287
00:34:39,055 --> 00:34:39,922
the devil,

288
00:34:41,123 --> 00:34:41,991
the devil,

289
00:34:43,292 --> 00:34:44,160
the devil,

290
00:34:45,727 --> 00:34:46,594
the devil,

291
00:34:47,862 --> 00:34:48,730
the devil,

292
00:34:49,864 --> 00:34:50,732
the devil,

293
00:34:52,101 --> 00:34:53,035
the devil,

294
00:34:53,069 --> 00:34:54,236
Mama?

295
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:55,470
The devil,

296
00:34:56,538 --> 00:34:57,206
the devil,

297
00:34:59,108 --> 00:34:59,976
the devil,

298
00:35:01,743 --> 00:35:02,610
the devil,

299
00:35:04,546 --> 00:35:05,214
the devil,

300
00:35:06,581 --> 00:35:07,950
the devil,

301
00:35:07,984 --> 00:35:08,850
the devil,

302
00:35:09,986 --> 00:35:11,220
the devil,

303
00:35:11,253 --> 00:35:12,854
the devil,

304
00:35:12,888 --> 00:35:13,755
the devil,

305
00:35:15,224 --> 00:35:16,092
the devil,

306
00:35:17,193 --> 00:35:18,727
the devil,

307
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,162
the devil,

308
00:35:20,196 --> 00:35:21,063
the devil,

309
00:35:21,998 --> 00:35:22,864
the devil,

310
00:35:24,133 --> 00:35:25,001
the devil,

311
00:35:26,701 --> 00:35:27,569
the devil,

312
00:35:28,636 --> 00:35:29,504
the devil,

313
00:35:31,806 --> 00:35:32,674
the devil!

314
00:35:33,808 --> 00:35:34,944
Oh, the devil!

315
00:35:36,879 --> 00:35:37,746
The devil!

316
00:35:39,915 --> 00:35:40,782
The devil!

317
00:35:45,921 --> 00:35:48,723
[horse neighing]

318
00:35:58,633 --> 00:36:00,936
Good lord, Solomon.

319
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:02,104
What brings you by?

320
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:05,840
Buck, mind if we speak?

321
00:36:05,874 --> 00:36:07,009
Yeah, sure as hell do.

322
00:36:08,676 --> 00:36:09,677
What's on your mind?

323
00:36:10,745 --> 00:36:12,214
[Solomon] I need your help.

324
00:36:13,681 --> 00:36:14,549
Really?

325
00:36:15,918 --> 00:36:17,685
[Solomon] I'm
looking for a man.

326
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:18,988
A man with a whore mother.

327
00:36:20,622 --> 00:36:22,757
He been causing some
trouble around here

328
00:36:22,791 --> 00:36:25,593
and stole some of
my army equipment.

329
00:36:25,627 --> 00:36:29,697
Oh, I haven't seen anybody
matching that description.

330
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,935
[Solomon] Any other
problems around here?

331
00:36:34,236 --> 00:36:36,005
We did have a murder
the other night.

332
00:36:36,038 --> 00:36:37,339
- Murder?
- Yeah.

333
00:36:37,373 --> 00:36:39,208
Brutal stabbing in the saloon.

334
00:36:40,809 --> 00:36:42,311
I suspect it had to do
with a gambling debt.

335
00:36:44,246 --> 00:36:45,780
[Solomon] You catch the game?

336
00:36:45,814 --> 00:36:46,681
Nope.

337
00:36:46,714 --> 00:36:47,582
No sign of him.

338
00:36:48,716 --> 00:36:50,886
Uh, just a boy, supposedly.

339
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,321
A boy?

340
00:36:52,354 --> 00:36:53,721
[Buck] Yeah, 19,
maybe 20 years old.

341
00:36:54,722 --> 00:36:55,590
Hmm.

342
00:36:59,694 --> 00:37:01,230
Which saloon?

343
00:37:01,263 --> 00:37:02,131
The Two-One.

344
00:37:05,201 --> 00:37:08,104
[soft tense music]

345
00:37:18,013 --> 00:37:19,215
Need another?

346
00:37:20,449 --> 00:37:23,219
I wanna meet your whores.

347
00:37:23,252 --> 00:37:28,257
What's your preference?

348
00:38:04,894 --> 00:38:05,760
Her.

349
00:38:22,011 --> 00:38:27,016
Were you here when the murder
happened the other night?

350
00:38:29,952 --> 00:38:30,953
Was it your boy?

351
00:38:36,525 --> 00:38:37,825
That's why you're here?

352
00:38:47,102 --> 00:38:49,471
Yeah.

353
00:38:49,505 --> 00:38:50,372
Kept it?

354
00:38:54,143 --> 00:38:55,010
Eagle feather.

355
00:38:57,845 --> 00:38:59,014
You shouldn't have this.

356
00:39:00,782 --> 00:39:03,818
I thought it was for
courage, during the hard times.

357
00:39:05,787 --> 00:39:07,755
[Solomon] Many
people thought so.

358
00:39:07,789 --> 00:39:09,124
I love that eagle feather.

359
00:39:23,005 --> 00:39:23,871
Hey.

360
00:39:25,975 --> 00:39:26,909
Made lieutenant.

361
00:39:32,847 --> 00:39:33,848
Are you married?

362
00:39:37,086 --> 00:39:37,953
No.

363
00:39:46,962 --> 00:39:48,297
You look tired.

364
00:39:53,202 --> 00:39:54,270
I am tired.

365
00:40:07,049 --> 00:40:09,784
[Megan humming]

366
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:44,353
[chest creaking]

367
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:57,626
[Megan humming]

368
00:42:09,071 --> 00:42:10,139
[Cal] What a shame.

369
00:42:12,207 --> 00:42:13,475
[Patty] What are you doing?

370
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:17,346
I'm gonna bury this
innocent creature.

371
00:42:17,379 --> 00:42:18,714
That's someone's catch.

372
00:42:18,747 --> 00:42:20,549
[soft music]

373
00:42:20,582 --> 00:42:22,117
Trapping innocent
animals to get their pelt.

374
00:42:23,185 --> 00:42:24,520
What kind of evil man does this?

375
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:31,660
Feel like animals deserve
funerals more than humans.

376
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,536
Cal, we don't even
have a pick or a shovel.

377
00:42:40,569 --> 00:42:42,371
And don't you think
we should be going?

378
00:42:42,404 --> 00:42:43,572
Heading North.

379
00:42:43,605 --> 00:42:45,207
We're not going North.

380
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,108
Why not?

381
00:42:47,609 --> 00:42:49,211
We got things to attend to.

382
00:42:49,244 --> 00:42:51,113
Cal, not for nothing,

383
00:42:51,146 --> 00:42:53,749
you just stabbed a man to
death back in Red Bluff.

384
00:42:53,782 --> 00:42:55,384
Law's gonna be looking for us.

385
00:42:58,353 --> 00:42:59,221
You're right.

386
00:43:00,389 --> 00:43:01,557
We ought to be prepared.

387
00:43:04,726 --> 00:43:05,661
For what?

388
00:43:07,162 --> 00:43:08,597
[Cal] To kill my father.

389
00:43:13,202 --> 00:43:16,138
[soft tense music]

390
00:43:27,149 --> 00:43:29,618
[bell ringing]

391
00:43:34,189 --> 00:43:35,057
Morning.

392
00:43:36,258 --> 00:43:38,660
[light music]

393
00:43:51,106 --> 00:43:53,642
[ominous music]

394
00:43:55,844 --> 00:43:58,113
[Lemay] A box of .45's.

395
00:44:05,354 --> 00:44:08,156
[Shopkeeper]
Cost you a dollar.

396
00:44:09,525 --> 00:44:11,693
Some youngins
came through town,

397
00:44:11,727 --> 00:44:13,262
just wanna know where they went.

398
00:44:17,232 --> 00:44:19,301
We got lots of
types come in here.

399
00:44:29,845 --> 00:44:32,614
I know when that group
come in, weren't no good.

400
00:44:34,783 --> 00:44:36,418
So these boys were no good,

401
00:44:36,451 --> 00:44:37,553
but you sold them
ammunition anyway.

402
00:44:40,122 --> 00:44:42,357
Not in my position
to do otherwise.

403
00:44:49,264 --> 00:44:52,134
Blood will be
on your hands sir.

404
00:44:55,837 --> 00:44:58,373
You don't know what's coming.

405
00:44:59,608 --> 00:45:02,344
[Megan humming]

406
00:45:33,609 --> 00:45:36,378
[urine dripping]

407
00:45:36,411 --> 00:45:39,147
[meta clanking]

408
00:45:47,356 --> 00:45:49,725
[Ernie] Holy Christ!

409
00:45:49,758 --> 00:45:52,361
[guns firing]

410
00:46:27,829 --> 00:46:30,900
[dark ominous music]

411
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:54,222
[guns firing]

412
00:47:03,732 --> 00:47:06,268
[boot thuds]

413
00:47:14,643 --> 00:47:16,979
[water rushing]

414
00:47:17,013 --> 00:47:20,415
[Megan singing softly]

415
00:47:54,083 --> 00:47:56,886
[birds chirping]

416
00:48:07,763 --> 00:48:08,797
You alone out here?

417
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:20,776
We got a camp right over yonder.

418
00:48:22,344 --> 00:48:23,779
You can join us for
breakfast if you want.

419
00:49:02,751 --> 00:49:05,353
[light music]

420
00:49:21,603 --> 00:49:25,540
This has always been
my favorite part of you.

421
00:49:31,513 --> 00:49:32,714
Tell me about your boy.

422
00:49:36,953 --> 00:49:38,054
Don't ask me that.

423
00:49:38,087 --> 00:49:39,654
That's not why you're here.

424
00:49:40,923 --> 00:49:41,790
It is.

425
00:49:43,926 --> 00:49:44,826
It's part of it.

426
00:49:46,661 --> 00:49:48,064
I never asked you for what
I know you couldn't give.

427
00:49:52,467 --> 00:49:53,135
He

428
00:49:55,570 --> 00:49:57,974
killed folks.

429
00:49:58,007 --> 00:49:58,874
And I born him.

430
00:50:02,577 --> 00:50:04,046
[Solomon] Where'd he go, Anna?

431
00:50:15,224 --> 00:50:16,424
Let him go.

432
00:50:16,458 --> 00:50:17,093
Just please, please.

433
00:50:19,728 --> 00:50:20,595
Let him go.

434
00:50:32,874 --> 00:50:34,409
[Buck] Solomon!

435
00:50:38,014 --> 00:50:40,582
Gideon, the man I was
telling you about.

436
00:50:40,615 --> 00:50:42,051
We're looking for a man

437
00:50:42,084 --> 00:50:43,585
who's been wandering
around these parts.

438
00:50:43,618 --> 00:50:45,054
He's killing his own kin.

439
00:50:46,956 --> 00:50:49,424
We're getting rumors out
of Kansas and Nebraska

440
00:50:50,792 --> 00:50:52,194
that he killed six
young men last year.

441
00:50:53,528 --> 00:50:55,764
They were all sired by whores.

442
00:50:57,499 --> 00:50:59,634
I never heard such a thing.

443
00:50:59,668 --> 00:51:02,138
We need a tracker
who knows these parts.

444
00:51:02,171 --> 00:51:03,471
I hear you're that man.

445
00:51:05,807 --> 00:51:07,642
I got problems of my own.

446
00:51:08,911 --> 00:51:10,112
Pay you a dollar a day.

447
00:51:12,014 --> 00:51:13,883
[Solomon] Don't
care about the money.

448
00:51:15,151 --> 00:51:16,484
Then do it for Jesus.

449
00:51:20,655 --> 00:51:22,824
I care about Him even less.

450
00:51:29,564 --> 00:51:31,833
[bell ringing]

451
00:51:31,866 --> 00:51:34,203
[soft music]

452
00:51:54,156 --> 00:51:56,092
A penny buys you two.

453
00:52:02,131 --> 00:52:03,698
I like your locket there.

454
00:52:08,803 --> 00:52:10,272
Who you got inside?

455
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:12,208
[Megan] Inside?

456
00:52:13,875 --> 00:52:15,211
A picture of your parents?

457
00:52:17,213 --> 00:52:18,513
Or a sweetheart?

458
00:52:22,851 --> 00:52:23,718
Nobody.

459
00:52:26,855 --> 00:52:30,059
[soft music continues]

460
00:53:43,432 --> 00:53:44,766
He was a good friend.

461
00:53:48,304 --> 00:53:49,771
Yeah, he knew the danger.

462
00:53:54,676 --> 00:53:55,844
My hand is killing me.

463
00:54:06,188 --> 00:54:09,058
[hand thudding]

464
00:54:09,091 --> 00:54:11,393
Yeah, you best get that
bandaged professionally.

465
00:54:12,995 --> 00:54:14,662
In the war, most men
died from infection.

466
00:54:16,465 --> 00:54:18,234
Smart place to go
would be Dillon.

467
00:54:30,012 --> 00:54:30,880
Hey Patty,

468
00:54:36,118 --> 00:54:38,053
you think God loves us?

469
00:54:59,942 --> 00:55:02,945
[suspenseful music]

470
00:55:13,189 --> 00:55:16,125
[knocking on door]

471
00:55:26,936 --> 00:55:29,071
I need you to fix my hand.

472
00:55:30,973 --> 00:55:32,141
Well, take a cot.

473
00:55:32,174 --> 00:55:33,309
I've got mining to do.

474
00:55:41,483 --> 00:55:44,420
[distant groaning]

475
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:04,772
Would you mind putting
a muzzle on that?

476
00:56:07,309 --> 00:56:08,410
What ails you?

477
00:56:11,413 --> 00:56:12,881
[Cal] My hand.

478
00:56:16,051 --> 00:56:21,023
Myself, I've just returned
from Brazil, godforsaken land.

479
00:56:22,524 --> 00:56:24,859
It's left me with a condition
I'm unable to shake.

480
00:56:27,263 --> 00:56:29,965
The Brazilians are
a disgusting people.

481
00:56:33,868 --> 00:56:34,836
Well, if you don't
like Brazil so much,

482
00:56:34,869 --> 00:56:36,538
why'd you go to Brazil?

483
00:56:36,572 --> 00:56:37,439
The work.

484
00:56:39,041 --> 00:56:40,542
Arab slave traders pay
a mighty penny still.

485
00:56:44,313 --> 00:56:47,216
This land has lost its
taste for violence.

486
00:56:47,249 --> 00:56:48,984
Lost the taste for conquest.

487
00:56:50,919 --> 00:56:52,087
I sought it elsewhere,

488
00:56:53,522 --> 00:56:55,524
the climate and
people, didn't suit me.

489
00:56:59,328 --> 00:57:01,030
Would you like to see something?

490
00:57:04,266 --> 00:57:05,134
[Cal] Yeah.

491
00:57:06,201 --> 00:57:07,835
My father gave this to me.

492
00:57:12,541 --> 00:57:15,244
Not sure how long I've
had it now, but...

493
00:57:15,277 --> 00:57:19,114
They didn't teach you to
look at people when you talk?

494
00:57:21,483 --> 00:57:22,850
I am looking at you.

495
00:57:26,488 --> 00:57:27,456
Is that an Indian head?

496
00:57:27,489 --> 00:57:29,857
Not just any Indian.

497
00:57:29,892 --> 00:57:31,260
It's Gomez.

498
00:57:31,293 --> 00:57:32,827
The great Apache chief.

499
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:36,332
This head was worth $2,000
before you and I were born.

500
00:57:39,168 --> 00:57:40,135
Son of a bitch.

501
00:57:42,338 --> 00:57:43,305
Grayton Willets.

502
00:57:43,339 --> 00:57:44,440
Of the Willets clan.

503
00:57:45,541 --> 00:57:48,477
[soft tense music]

504
00:58:03,225 --> 00:58:05,627
[baby crying]

505
00:58:34,289 --> 00:58:36,959
[man shushing]

506
00:58:48,270 --> 00:58:51,273
[suspenseful music]

507
00:58:57,713 --> 00:59:00,315
[baby crying]

508
00:59:25,307 --> 00:59:28,110
Those three marks on
your chin, they come off?

509
00:59:30,512 --> 00:59:31,380
Nope.

510
00:59:36,585 --> 00:59:39,188
[Gideon] Buck told me
you were taken as a child.

511
00:59:42,291 --> 00:59:43,158
Found.

512
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:46,328
A better word is found.

513
00:59:49,731 --> 00:59:53,335
They raised me when
my family was killed.

514
00:59:55,537 --> 00:59:56,672
I cannot imagine.

515
00:59:59,808 --> 01:00:01,677
You read of the
Scripture, Solomon?

516
01:00:03,512 --> 01:00:04,379
[Solomon] No.

517
01:00:06,482 --> 01:00:11,487
The Bible says, "Satan goes
to and fro across the Earth

518
01:00:14,056 --> 01:00:18,427
like a roaring lion, searching
for someone to devour."

519
01:00:22,631 --> 01:00:26,068
This man that we're chasing,

520
01:00:28,136 --> 01:00:29,238
I'm beginning to think

521
01:00:32,207 --> 01:00:34,142
we might be chasing
the devil himself.

522
01:00:37,513 --> 01:00:38,780
He's just a man.

523
01:00:41,283 --> 01:00:42,518
Like the rest of us.

524
01:00:47,523 --> 01:00:48,790
You don't believe in God?

525
01:00:55,731 --> 01:00:57,032
What do you believe in?

526
01:01:05,207 --> 01:01:07,442
I believe we'll catch
a murderer tomorrow.

527
01:01:15,551 --> 01:01:18,387
[hooves clopping]

528
01:02:22,751 --> 01:02:27,756
[weapon thudding]
[horse neighing]

529
01:02:29,959 --> 01:02:35,163
[fist thudding]
[Lemay groaning]

530
01:02:37,532 --> 01:02:40,569
[Lemay yells out]

531
01:02:40,602 --> 01:02:45,607
[fist thudding]
[Lemay laughing]

532
01:02:53,715 --> 01:02:56,919
[fist thudding]

533
01:02:56,953 --> 01:02:59,755
[Lemay laughing]

534
01:03:03,291 --> 01:03:05,761
[men groaning]

535
01:03:15,337 --> 01:03:17,940
[wolves howling]

536
01:03:26,983 --> 01:03:29,651
[man groaning]

537
01:03:36,993 --> 01:03:40,195
[both men grunting]

538
01:03:53,675 --> 01:03:56,211
[soft music]

539
01:05:12,354 --> 01:05:15,724
[Lemay breathing heavily]

540
01:05:57,532 --> 01:05:59,835
[Grayton] Must
admit your proposal

541
01:05:59,868 --> 01:06:02,571
is one of the more
grotesque I've come across.

542
01:06:02,604 --> 01:06:04,073
Helping killing your own father.

543
01:06:05,908 --> 01:06:07,576
[Cal] Well, he's supposed
to be one of the worst killers

544
01:06:07,609 --> 01:06:08,743
this land's ever known.

545
01:06:10,612 --> 01:06:13,049
[Grayton] A little secret
about legendary gunfighters,

546
01:06:13,082 --> 01:06:15,985
they tend to die like the rest
of us when shot in the head.

547
01:06:19,021 --> 01:06:22,024
Tell me about this gun
you got your hands on.

548
01:06:23,159 --> 01:06:24,426
[Cal] Army issue.

549
01:06:24,459 --> 01:06:25,694
.45 caliber.

550
01:06:25,727 --> 01:06:27,029
- 200 rounds a minute.
- Whoa!

551
01:06:27,063 --> 01:06:29,364
[bird squawks]
What the fuck is that?

552
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,003
[light eerie music]

553
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:47,816
What are you doing?

554
01:06:47,849 --> 01:06:49,886
Well, helping a man out.

555
01:06:51,187 --> 01:06:52,821
[Grayton] Man's got no horse,

556
01:06:52,854 --> 01:06:53,688
gonna die out here
when the sun sets.

557
01:06:53,722 --> 01:06:55,423
Ashes to ashes.

558
01:06:55,457 --> 01:06:57,659
Banged up pretty
bad, aren't you?

559
01:06:57,692 --> 01:06:58,827
What happened?

560
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:04,166
[intense music]

561
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:08,170
[Lemay mumbling]

562
01:07:13,775 --> 01:07:14,809
What?

563
01:07:14,843 --> 01:07:15,912
Get my gun.

564
01:07:18,847 --> 01:07:20,950
He wants me to get his gun.

565
01:07:20,983 --> 01:07:24,619
- [gun clicks]
- Take me with you.

566
01:07:24,653 --> 01:07:25,922
Can't do that.

567
01:07:27,256 --> 01:07:30,059
You got any money on you?

568
01:07:30,092 --> 01:07:33,095
[sharp tense music]

569
01:07:34,863 --> 01:07:38,134
I'll tell you something
that you wanna know.

570
01:07:38,167 --> 01:07:41,703
And what the fuck
would I want to know?

571
01:07:42,737 --> 01:07:43,805
Pray tell me.

572
01:07:52,214 --> 01:07:53,082
Go on.

573
01:07:54,649 --> 01:07:56,052
You ain't the one.

574
01:08:03,125 --> 01:08:03,960
Die.

575
01:08:11,133 --> 01:08:13,735
[tense music]

576
01:08:48,570 --> 01:08:50,072
You're surrounded
by armed men.

577
01:08:56,312 --> 01:08:57,846
Don't move or I'll shoot you.

578
01:09:08,656 --> 01:09:11,526
[woman screaming]

579
01:09:19,001 --> 01:09:21,536
[gun firing]

580
01:09:31,147 --> 01:09:32,614
- [gun cocks]
- Easy.

581
01:09:35,317 --> 01:09:36,252
Cheyenne?

582
01:09:37,719 --> 01:09:39,788
Yeah, you could say that.

583
01:09:41,190 --> 01:09:42,690
[Lemay] Only ones
I could never hear.

584
01:09:56,671 --> 01:10:00,575
If it was me,
we'd burn you alive.

585
01:10:02,344 --> 01:10:03,913
I know what you really are.

586
01:10:06,982 --> 01:10:08,716
You may not be
the devil himself,

587
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:10,852
but I know you are
familiar with his ways.

588
01:10:10,886 --> 01:10:11,987
Easy Gideon.

589
01:10:12,021 --> 01:10:13,621
Solomon, he's got a right

590
01:10:13,655 --> 01:10:14,756
to give the beast a
piece of his mind.

591
01:10:14,789 --> 01:10:16,791
Yeah, I'd give him one piece.

592
01:10:16,825 --> 01:10:17,692
Hey.

593
01:10:20,162 --> 01:10:23,299
[Gideon] You'd kill
me to protect him?

594
01:10:25,367 --> 01:10:26,235
Hand it over.

595
01:10:35,311 --> 01:10:37,079
You don't see
what he really is.

596
01:10:40,748 --> 01:10:43,052
What are you gonna do
when the Rapture comes?

597
01:10:45,387 --> 01:10:47,356
Come let's go, come, get.

598
01:11:02,704 --> 01:11:04,440
[Cal] What do you think?

599
01:11:04,473 --> 01:11:07,343
I think it's the most
magnificent thing I've ever seen.

600
01:11:09,912 --> 01:11:11,447
We best get a move on.

601
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:13,648
All those guns could
belong to some law.

602
01:11:17,286 --> 01:11:18,387
You got some
men we can call on

603
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:19,821
to help assist with this task?

604
01:11:21,223 --> 01:11:22,291
I believe I do.

605
01:11:45,181 --> 01:11:48,284
[carriage clattering]

606
01:11:50,852 --> 01:11:53,155
Gather round, ye men
of the Willets clan!

607
01:11:54,323 --> 01:11:55,958
What you got there, brother?

608
01:11:55,991 --> 01:11:56,892
New friend.

609
01:11:58,260 --> 01:11:59,161
And a new toy.

610
01:12:10,406 --> 01:12:12,007
Where, pray tell did you find

611
01:12:12,041 --> 01:12:13,275
this immaculate
piece of weaponry?

612
01:12:14,376 --> 01:12:15,978
I didn't find it.

613
01:12:16,011 --> 01:12:16,878
I took it.

614
01:12:18,214 --> 01:12:19,847
Killed a lot of men
to get this gun.

615
01:12:23,352 --> 01:12:24,852
What say we have a drink?

616
01:13:00,522 --> 01:13:01,823
You trust this clan?

617
01:13:09,164 --> 01:13:10,966
I don't gotta trust them.

618
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,235
I just need a few men to
help me kill my father.

619
01:13:15,837 --> 01:13:17,839
Because he cut your
mama's finger off?

620
01:13:24,846 --> 01:13:26,814
I can understand
if you're scared.

621
01:13:26,848 --> 01:13:28,450
Want to get out of
here, cut loose.

622
01:13:29,918 --> 01:13:31,086
This ain't your problem.

623
01:13:34,923 --> 01:13:36,025
And go where?

624
01:13:37,993 --> 01:13:38,860
Do what?

625
01:14:16,932 --> 01:14:20,202
[Solomon] You really
do what they say?

626
01:14:23,038 --> 01:14:24,306
What do they say?

627
01:14:27,543 --> 01:14:28,610
Kill your children?

628
01:14:32,681 --> 01:14:34,083
Their blood was cursed.

629
01:14:38,454 --> 01:14:41,290
Not even the Cheyenne
believe these things anymore.

630
01:14:51,967 --> 01:14:53,268
All my life,

631
01:14:55,204 --> 01:14:56,638
people been scared of me.

632
01:15:01,710 --> 01:15:03,011
Disgusted by me,

633
01:15:06,382 --> 01:15:10,219
but nobody ever asked
me what it means.

634
01:15:12,554 --> 01:15:14,323
It means safe passage.

635
01:15:20,028 --> 01:15:22,364
[Solomon] To the afterlife.

636
01:15:24,566 --> 01:15:27,636
[dark ominous music]

637
01:15:56,265 --> 01:15:59,535
[Solomon clears throat]

638
01:16:22,391 --> 01:16:24,126
[Gideon] I believe you
and I have found ourself

639
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:26,495
in a situation of
mutual interest.

640
01:16:28,230 --> 01:16:29,364
You know where my father is?

641
01:16:29,398 --> 01:16:30,999
[Gideon] Yes, I do.

642
01:16:31,033 --> 01:16:32,234
And I know something
better than that.

643
01:16:32,267 --> 01:16:33,502
I know where's he going.

644
01:16:34,770 --> 01:16:36,572
You gotta make me a promise.

645
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:40,442
[Cal] What's that?

646
01:16:40,476 --> 01:16:41,743
Kill him good.

647
01:16:43,345 --> 01:16:46,415
[dark intense music]

648
01:17:13,842 --> 01:17:17,379
[townspeople chattering]

649
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:22,084
[dark music continues]

650
01:17:45,107 --> 01:17:45,774
[Anna] When you going?

651
01:17:45,807 --> 01:17:47,676
Tomorrow.

652
01:17:47,709 --> 01:17:49,478
[Anna] Oh. Thought you'd
last longer than a week.

653
01:17:49,511 --> 01:17:52,347
Just needed some
scratch to get on through.

654
01:17:52,381 --> 01:17:53,248
You wanna come?

655
01:17:58,487 --> 01:18:00,756
Your boy killed more men.

656
01:18:00,789 --> 01:18:02,357
He did not.

657
01:18:02,391 --> 01:18:03,225
[hand thudding]
I told you he left.

658
01:18:03,258 --> 01:18:04,660
Where?

659
01:18:04,693 --> 01:18:06,328
You're aiding and
abetting a criminal.

660
01:18:06,361 --> 01:18:07,696
What did you say?

661
01:18:07,729 --> 01:18:09,598
Aiding a boy I brought
into this world.

662
01:18:09,631 --> 01:18:11,433
A boy I love so much.

663
01:18:11,466 --> 01:18:14,236
A boy I couldn't do
anything for, let him go,

664
01:18:14,269 --> 01:18:17,072
when all I wanted to do was
to take care of him myself.

665
01:18:25,147 --> 01:18:26,582
No, no, don't.

666
01:18:27,649 --> 01:18:28,750
What are you doing with him?

667
01:18:28,784 --> 01:18:30,652
Please don't do this, please.

668
01:18:30,686 --> 01:18:32,521
Just, just calm down.

669
01:18:37,659 --> 01:18:40,195
[gun clicks]

670
01:18:41,163 --> 01:18:42,397
Thanks, soldier.

[dark ominous music]

673
01:18:51,206 --> 01:18:55,844
What have you done! [cries]

674
01:19:06,923 --> 01:19:10,859
[dark ominous music continues]

675
01:19:20,235 --> 01:19:22,905
- [metal tapping]
- Hey!

676
01:19:22,939 --> 01:19:23,805
Hey!

677
01:19:30,879 --> 01:19:33,615
[door thudding]

678
01:19:40,890 --> 01:19:42,190
Now pack your things.

679
01:19:42,224 --> 01:19:43,258
Come on, let's get a move on.

680
01:19:43,291 --> 01:19:44,393
I can't do this.

681
01:19:47,462 --> 01:19:48,497
I did this for you.

682
01:19:49,464 --> 01:19:50,565
You're just like him.

683
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:52,334
You're the devil.

684
01:19:56,304 --> 01:19:57,606
You killed the man...

685
01:19:59,841 --> 01:20:00,709
Huh?

686
01:20:02,979 --> 01:20:04,379
Killed the man that what?

687
01:20:06,983 --> 01:20:08,283
Killed the man that what?

688
01:20:08,316 --> 01:20:09,651
You killed the man I loved.

689
01:20:11,386 --> 01:20:12,521
I can't go with you.

690
01:20:15,892 --> 01:20:18,293
What the hell are
you gonna do here?

691
01:20:18,326 --> 01:20:19,461
Same as I've always done.

692
01:20:19,494 --> 01:20:20,362
I'm a whore.

693
01:20:23,699 --> 01:20:25,567
You are not a whore.

694
01:20:38,714 --> 01:20:41,249
[hand slaps]

695
01:20:49,491 --> 01:20:50,960
You're not a whore.

696
01:21:01,037 --> 01:21:02,270
We're going up North.

697
01:21:03,371 --> 01:21:04,239
Together.

698
01:21:11,914 --> 01:21:13,348
[doors thudding]

699
01:21:13,381 --> 01:21:15,985
What's going on here?
[gun firing]

700
01:21:19,387 --> 01:21:20,589
He's in town.

I heard you were a legend.

715
01:26:07,842 --> 01:26:12,847
My family makes their
name killing legends.

716
01:26:14,216 --> 01:26:16,751
Make a nice head
for my collection.

717

[gun firing]

739
01:31:45,514 --> 01:31:46,448
Let's ride.

740
01:31:54,690 --> 01:31:57,893
[Anna] She did not wait
to verify that he was dead.

741
01:31:58,961 --> 01:32:02,531
Or rather she moved on alone.

742
01:32:02,564 --> 01:32:04,333
