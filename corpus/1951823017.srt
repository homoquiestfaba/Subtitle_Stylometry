1
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:50,684
Excuse me!

2
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:52,918
Hello.

3
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:00,764
Hi.

4
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,300
Sorry to bother you.

5
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:04,336
I just, um...

6
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:05,837
Do you live around here?

7
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:07,463
Yeah.

8
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,509
Um, I'm supposed to meet
my friend at this diner

9
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:12,567
on, um, 4th and 7th?

10
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,169
Right.

11
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:17,410
Do you know where that is?
Am I going the right way?

12
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,145
Um...what diner?

13
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:24,019
Um...hang on.

14
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,524
I wrote it down somewhere.

15
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,154
Uh, Daisy's?

16
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:30,786
Oh, yeah.

17
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:32,057
You know where it is?

18
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:32,654
Yeah.

19
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:35,030
OK, so what should I do?

20
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,069
Uh...OK.

21
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:42,164
Um, basically, um, OK,
go out this exit,

22
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:44,436
go to your right,

23
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:49,311
and then take the left staircase
out to the floor level.

24
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:53,910
Um, and then, OK,
you're going to get out

25
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:58,150
and go left on the street right there.

26
00:05:58,224 --> 00:05:58,815
So l--

27
00:05:58,891 --> 00:05:59,653
This street right here.

28
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:02,058
So I take a left when I go
out to the street?

29
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:05,063
Yeah, go left,
go left out of the station,

30
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:06,860
left on the street,

31
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:09,094
and then go, like,
two blocks up,

32
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:11,898
and then, um...
what do you see over there?

33
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:14,997
I'm trying to think.

34
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:16,132
Um...

35
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:37,488
Thanks for walking with me.

36
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,292
It's really nice of you.

37
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:39,990
Yeah, no problem.

38
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:43,035
Kind of a bad situation right now.

39
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:44,729
My friend--
I should have known.

40
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,601
It's typical of my friend, Samantha.

41
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,572
She, um...

42
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:50,871
last I heard from her
was on this message

43
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:53,503
where she said she had lost
her phone charger.

44
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,639
And the only way
I knew where to go

45
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,343
was that she
left me that message

46
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:02,377
saying to meet at the diner,
so otherwise I would be...

47
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:04,616
I don't know what I would do.

48
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:05,622
Really?

49
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:07,056
Yeah.

50
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:09,321
That sucks.

51
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:11,124
Yeah.

52
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:12,596
It does.

53
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,205
But anyway,
she's really irresponsible,

54
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,711
and, like, she's that kind of person

55
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,043
where if you want to hang out

56
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,447
at, like, 8:00 at night
or something,

57
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:35,351
you should probably tell her
to get ready around 7:00

58
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:38,151
because just give her
an hour extra

59
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:39,987
because she's going to be
late anyway.

60
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:42,960
Then she'd still be late
even if you did that, you know?

61
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:46,396
Yeah.

62
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,627
Yeah, my friend Rick
is actually like that.

63
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:50,430
Really?

64
00:07:50,502 --> 00:07:52,527
Yeah, like the other day

65
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:54,596
we went to eat
at this Mexican place,

66
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:57,837
and, like, the bill came
and it was like...

67
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:01,471
like I had cash and, like,
he only had his card,

68
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:04,072
so he was like, "Oh, I'll just
pay for it on my card

69
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,879
and you can give me cash
or whatever."

70
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:08,512
And I was like, "OK, cool,"
like, not that big of a deal,

71
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:10,556
and then, you know,
like, two hours later

72
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,352
we were at home
and we realized

73
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:14,450
that, like, he forgot his card
at the restaurant.

74
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,222
But then it was even worse

75
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:18,263
because then for, like,
the next three days,

76
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,128
anytime we went and, like,
ate somewhere together

77
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,190
or, like, did anything
that cost money,

78
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:24,736
he was like,
"Oh, I don't have my card,"

79
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:27,534
and then, like, I was the only
one who, like, had cash on me

80
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,575
so I'd end up paying
for everything, you know.

81
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:31,701
Oh, that's not cool.
That's not good.

82
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:33,904
Just, like, flaking

83
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,948
and, you know,
being really, like, forgetful.

84
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:39,815
Yeah, although I have to admit,
I just did that about a week ago.

85
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:42,582
What? Like forgot
your card somewhere?

86
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:43,952
Yeah.

87
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,820
Although it's usually
my keys that I forget

88
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,224
because when I come home,
I just, like, throw my stuff down,

89
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:50,626
I just throw my keys,
but not ever in the same place.

90
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:54,029
Like it's always just, like,
somewhere where I can't find them.

91
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,829
And, like, I probably waste
ten minutes a day

92
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:56,960
looking for my keys.

93
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:05,835
- Hey.
- Hey.

94
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:06,901
What's up?

95
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:09,470
Uh, she's not in there,

96
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:16,512
so, um, I guess I'm just going
to wait inside for her,

97
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:19,422
see if she calls me
or shows up, you know.

98
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,084
OK.

99
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,593
Cool.

100
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:24,687
Well, I don't know.

101
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,391
Nice meeting you, I guess.

102
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:28,296
Yeah, nice meeting you, too.

103
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:37,141
No luck.

104
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:38,767
No.

105
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:46,644
So do you come here a lot?

106
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:49,882
Um, well, I used to,

107
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,651
but I don't so much anymore.

108
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:55,285
My ex-girlfriend actually
used to like to come here.

109
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,454
Are we going to run into her?

110
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,725
No. She actually
doesn't live here.

111
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,892
She lives in Alaska.

112
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,402
Why Alaska?

113
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:04,936
She's from there.

114
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,767
She's from Alaska?

115
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:07,771
Yeah.

116
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,137
Interesting.

117
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,698
What is she doing there now?

118
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,471
She just went back home, or...

119
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,137
Yeah.

120
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:18,047
She, like, teaches history.

121
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,209
What's her name?

122
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,082
Amy.

123
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:23,587
Do you guys still talk a lot?

124
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,419
Uh, not really.

125
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:27,459
We're not on bad terms,

126
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:31,053
but we just don't happen
to speak as much anymore.

127
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:51,145
We shared a room.

128
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:54,675
I had, you know, two roommates
at the time,

129
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:56,517
and she moved in with us.

130
00:10:56,589 --> 00:11:00,889
So it was us two in one room
and then my two other roommates,

131
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,689
which was kind of weird

132
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:05,560
because the whole, like,
eight months that I was living here,

133
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:08,099
and she was still in Florida,

134
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,635
I was kind of hanging out
with them all the time

135
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:13,171
because they're my friends
or whatever.

136
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,867
And then kind of when she
got here, it was more about...

137
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:17,932
I guess I sort of...

138
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,410
we just only kind of wanted
to hang out together,

139
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:25,348
so it was, like, we kind of,

140
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,511
you know, fenced ourselves
off from them

141
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:29,645
even though we were all living
in the same place.

142
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:31,849
It was, like, this thing

143
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:34,757
that you want to just
keep it to yourself, I guess,

144
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:38,627
if that makes sense.

145
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:43,135
What do you think
you're going to do?

146
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,931
That's a good question.

147
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:48,132
Uh...

148
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,801
is this place open 24 hours or...

149
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,605
Yeah.

150
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:54,805
What, are you just going
to hang out here all night

151
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,111
and wait for her?

152
00:11:58,184 --> 00:11:59,515
Um, yeah.

153
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:02,486
You think that's a bad idea?

154
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,955
Uh...I don't know
if it's a bad idea.

155
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:08,289
Maybe it's not necessarily
a great idea.

156
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,793
I mean,
I don't know what--

157
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:13,662
I guess I could just
keep calling her,

158
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,166
like, try to find--

159
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,169
I don't have her address
or anything.

160
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,204
You can...

161
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:22,536
if you want to hang out
with me, I don't mind,

162
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:27,068
and I mean, just while you keep
trying to find her, you know.

163
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:29,410
I mean, we could just
hang out at my place

164
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:33,418
so you don't have to just sit
in the diner alone, you know.

165
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:34,714
Really?

166
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:39,690
Yeah, I mean, my couch is open.

167
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,852
It's available.

168
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,758
Well, hopefully
I won't have to spend--

169
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:44,887
No, no, no, no.

170
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:47,432
That's really nice.
It's not weird.

171
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,627
I just hopefully won't have to
spend the night or anything

172
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,465
because I'm hoping
that she'll call me back

173
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:54,563
before that happens.

174
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:04,776
What are you doing now?

175
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:10,083
Just making sure
she hasn't called me.

176
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:13,986
I'm sorry.

177
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:16,152
I'm really, I'm really
nervous right now.

178
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,526
I hope I'm not
freaking you out or, like...

179
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:20,588
I'm just really nervous.

180
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:21,724
Sorry.

181
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:34,977
Can I put my stuff down, like...

182
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:36,708
Yeah, yeah, wherever.

183
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:38,113
OK.

184
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:00,699
Do you want a drink
or something?

185
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,240
Sure.

186
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:03,707
Let me see.

187
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,869
I'm not sure what we have.

188
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:16,485
Looks pretty barren.

189
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:20,889
Do you want, like, a drink
or do you want a drinky drink?

190
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,188
Like alcohol?

191
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:23,193
Yeah.

192
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:24,286
Yeah.

193
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,695
I mean, do you want a drink?

194
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:29,325
Yeah, we can drink.

195
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:31,460
Get a little loosey goosey.

196
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:35,064
Um...

197
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,199
All I have is this bottle of wine

198
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:40,439
that I was actually
kind of trying to save

199
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:42,878
because my dad sent it to me.

200
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:45,610
My dad's, like,
kind of a wine nut

201
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:49,120
so he'll send me these
random, like, wines.

202
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,782
I never really understand them
when I get them.

203
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:53,916
Like he'll talk about
how great they are,

204
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:55,426
and then I'll taste them,

205
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:57,860
and they all taste
the fuckin' same to me.

206
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,488
But we can try it.

207
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,260
I don't know.

208
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,823
Do you know what pinot noir is?

209
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,563
Is that good?

210
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:09,336
I think it's supposed to be better
than, like, merlot or cabernet.

211
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,876
I like most of those
that I've tried,

212
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:13,070
if you want to try it.

213
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:16,171
All right.
We'll give it a whirl.

214
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,272
Thank you.

215
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:19,146
Yeah, no problem.

216
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:22,886
So this is really nice of you

217
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,923
to let me stay
at your apartment.

218
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,515
I know I already said this,
but I really appreciate it a lot

219
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,493
just because
I don't really know

220
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,721
what I would be doing
right now if...

221
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:32,729
No, that's fine.

222
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:33,992
You know?

223
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:35,795
Sorry, but I don't have
any wine glasses.

224
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,631
Would it be weird if...

225
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:39,500
I'm not really picky.

226
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:40,595
It's fine.

227
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:45,067
You want to "cheers"?

228
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:47,078
Yeah, we probably should.

229
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:49,171
OK. To what?

230
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:50,738
I have no idea.

231
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:51,976
My old man?

232
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:53,040
Nah.

233
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,348
Why not?

234
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,651
Why don't we just cheers
to drinking this wine

235
00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:58,781
that I've been saving?

236
00:15:58,857 --> 00:15:59,789
OK.

237
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:01,120
Sounds good.

238
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:07,622
It smells weird.

239
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,861
It's pretty bitter.

240
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:13,568
And kind of sweet
at the same time.

241
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,539
Is that good?

242
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:17,541
It depends on what you like.

243
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:19,076
I don't really know.

244
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:22,739
Do you like bitter things
or do you like sweet drinks?

245
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,477
I guess I like sweet, maybe.

246
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:41,623
Do you know how to play
this keyboard?

247
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:42,625
Not really.

248
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:45,162
It looks like you were trying
to teach yourself right here.

249
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,629
Yeah.

250
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:50,259
I just hold the easy, like,
chord button.

251
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,378
How would I make a G
over here?

252
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:11,548
Right here.

253
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:13,454
This is G.

254
00:18:13,524 --> 00:18:15,685
That's C Major.

255
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,693
What's that?

256
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:17,854
Is it D?

257
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:18,862
No.

258
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:19,863
D Minor.

259
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:20,990
Yeah.

260
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:25,230
So you hear
the difference in this?

261
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:26,635
This sounds like it's Halloween.

262
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:28,605
1, 2, 3, 4...

263
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:38,945
So D...

264
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:41,485
- A.
- A.

265
00:18:41,552 --> 00:18:42,746
C.

266
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,345
OK.

267
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:48,219
Ooh, that was good.

268
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:01,571
That's good!

269
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,540
Sounds like a real song.

270
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:18,723
Ooh, you got sad there.

271
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,485
That was the Halloween,
wasn't it?

272
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,958
Yes.

273
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:23,494
You're getting good at this.

274
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:25,224
That song was genius.

275
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:28,425
I noticed you have
a little recorder over here.

276
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,865
What's on here?

277
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:31,163
Nothing.

278
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:32,396
Just words.

279
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:33,403
Words?

280
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:34,404
Yeah.

281
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:35,906
Can I play it?

282
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:37,066
Um...

283
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:40,168
I'm curious to see
what's on it.

284
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,882
What's that?

285
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:50,353
Did I do that?

286
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:53,619
I don't even remember.

287
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:58,595
Sounds like a bunch
of stuff going on.

288
00:19:58,664 --> 00:19:59,790
Yeah, it sounds like music

289
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,129
that maybe
I would have recorded,

290
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,930
but I don't remember
doing it, so...

291
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:05,162
But you?

292
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:06,067
Like this is you,

293
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:07,969
or, like, you recorded
some music?

294
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,234
No, recorded me.

295
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:09,535
Oh, really?

296
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:10,939
Yeah, sometimes if l, like,

297
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:14,467
don't feel like actually
recording properly with a mike,

298
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,241
I'll just do that so I can remember

299
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,146
the notes of the song
or the idea, you know.

300
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,479
Mm-hmm.

301
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,541
So what do you play?

302
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:25,215
I can barely play guitar
and barely play drums.

303
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,155
And now you can play this.

304
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,784
Yeah, barely.

305
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,021
This much.

306
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:38,027
Who cuts your hair?

307
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:40,799
Why? Does it look stupid?

308
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:42,897
No.

309
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:31,015
Hey.

310
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,015
Sorry.

311
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,016
That's OK.

312
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,017
It took forever.

313
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:36,111
I couldn't find these matches.

314
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,018
It's so cold.

315
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:38,249
I know.
I'm freezing.

316
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:42,760
It's really bad.
It's so cold!

317
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:43,817
It's super windy.

318
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:46,420
I don't even know if I'm going
to be able to light this.

319
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:47,726
I'll help you.

320
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:49,596
Do you want to build
a little fortress?

321
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:59,170
Try it again.

322
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,411
Got it.

323
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,667
Do you always
roll your own cigarettes?

324
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:26,203
No, no.

325
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:28,967
I just didn't have enough money
to buy any nam-brained--

326
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,235
I mean, name-brand.

327
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:34,210
You just switched the letters.
I do that all the time.

328
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:35,712
Me, too.

329
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,111
How do you feel about the hair?

330
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,013
Um...I like it.

331
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,580
Can you tell any difference?

332
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:47,852
Not really.

333
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,053
Yeah, me either.

334
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:52,426
I was scared.
It was 'cause I was nervous.

335
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:54,192
I didn't want you
to not like it.

336
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,598
No, it was a valiant effort.

337
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:57,965
Thanks.

338
00:23:58,036 --> 00:23:58,866
You're welcome.

339
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,632
I did cut hair, though.

340
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:02,730
I wasn't pretending
to cut your hair.

341
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:05,174
I mean, I did cut some,
so there is a difference.

342
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:08,838
No, I can feel the little, like,
hairs on my neck and stuff.

343
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:10,245
Oh, can you?

344
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:10,610
It's kind of making me itch.

345
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:11,614
Sorry.

346
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:14,277
No, it's OK.
It's natural, it happens.

347
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:15,751
Yeah.

348
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:18,588
Man, it's cold.

349
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:19,749
Are you almost
done with that?

350
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:20,416
What's that?

351
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:21,584
Are you almost done?

352
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:25,824
Yeah, actually, I only need
about half to get the fix.

353
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,997
I think I'm going to go
and take a shower anyway

354
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:33,469
just to get the, you know,
get the little hairs off.

355
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:35,529
OK.

356
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:36,767
Yeah.

357
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,441
Hello?

358
00:25:56,821 --> 00:26:00,018
Hello?

359
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:01,649
What are you doing?

360
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:10,862
It's not good.

361
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,040
No, I can't find my friend.

362
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,534
I can't find Samantha.

363
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:24,915
No, I'm not, I'm not...

364
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:26,883
I don't know
what's going on.

365
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:30,917
I was staying with her.

366
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:33,753
I'm staying with some--
this guy.

367
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:36,385
I met this guy, and I'm staying
with this guy.

368
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:40,055
Yeah, this guy named Charlie.

369
00:26:41,565 --> 00:26:43,294
I don't really know.

370
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:50,167
It's not like that.

371
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:52,641
What else am I supposed to do?

372
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:56,870
Do you know what I'm saying?

373
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:00,677
Hello?

374
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:08,025
Do you want me to explain
what happened?

375
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:12,922
Why don't I just tell you
what happened?

376
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:18,266
Don't be like that.

377
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:22,167
Hello?

378
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,986
Why did you hang up?

379
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,308
Well...

380
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:02,341
I'm not doing anything wrong.

381
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:09,353
I would not do that.

382
00:28:11,555 --> 00:28:13,250
I wouldn't do that.

383
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:18,453
Fine.

384
00:29:06,543 --> 00:29:07,601
Hi.

385
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,012
Hi. What are you doing?

386
00:29:16,487 --> 00:29:18,387
Just practicing.

387
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:20,048
Yeah? How's that going?

388
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,525
It's going good.

389
00:29:22,593 --> 00:29:24,959
Whose is this?
Is this yours?

390
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:26,758
No, it's my roommate's.

391
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:28,822
I don't even know what it does.

392
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:32,662
This is basically
the most useless thing

393
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:34,398
I've ever seen in my life.

394
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:35,404
It woke you up.

395
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:36,405
Yeah, that's true.

396
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:37,907
I think it's fun.

397
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:40,240
Sorry.

398
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:42,245
How'd you like my bed?

399
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:43,837
It's very comfortable.

400
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:46,449
Yeah.

401
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:47,610
Are you mad?

402
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:49,448
I didn't mean to fall asleep.

403
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:51,648
No, I didn't mean
to say it like that.

404
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:56,425
So...what's up?

405
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:59,190
Did you find your friend?

406
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:00,891
She hasn't called.

407
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,990
Are you sick of me yet?

408
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:04,534
No.

409
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:06,797
Are you sure, because
I understand if you are.

410
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:09,271
Nope, it's OK.

411
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,534
Are you sure?

412
00:30:10,607 --> 00:30:12,541
Yeah, I really have
nothing else to do,

413
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:15,875
so it's actually
a nice, pleasant distraction.

414
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:16,879
Guess what.

415
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:18,108
What?

416
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:22,643
I think I found her address,
my friend's address.

417
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,687
How'd you do that?

418
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:26,519
The Internet.
I tried to look her up.

419
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:27,717
I found it.

420
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:29,316
Really? You can do that?

421
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:30,986
Yeah, you can do that.
You didn't know that?

422
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:33,360
I don't know if I like that.

423
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:34,898
Well, let me see it just so l
see if I know where it is.

424
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:37,628
Yeah, I wrote it down.

425
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:45,601
See anything?

426
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:46,659
Nn-nnn.

427
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,253
You want to ring
the second floor people,

428
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:07,882
and maybe they'll just
let us in?

429
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:04,299
How's it going?

430
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:06,233
Aah!

431
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:07,737
Shhh, someone might hear.

432
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:10,296
Don't do that.
Someone might hear.

433
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:21,041
Are these hula hoops?

434
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,814
They look kind of big
to be hula hoops.

435
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:23,945
I was going to say
the same thing.

436
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:25,386
They look really big.

437
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,855
Oh, they're really heavy.

438
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:28,687
Try to pick one up.

439
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:33,694
You look so beautiful.

440
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:34,696
Thanks.

441
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:36,289
You kind of look like a pilgrim.

442
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:37,800
I kind of look like a pilgrim.

443
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:39,302
But if you put this on,

444
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:42,464
it's kind of like you can
hear yourself really, really well.

445
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,802
I know.

446
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,570
I'm hearing really weird, too.

447
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:46,940
With that hat on?

448
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:48,638
Uh...yeah, it sounds
really different.

449
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:49,645
Put this hat on.

450
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:51,341
OK.

451
00:35:51,415 --> 00:35:52,905
It's really weird.

452
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:07,687
"Feast For Crows."

453
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:18,807
That's kind of a cool cover.

454
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:19,968
Here.

455
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:27,007
What is that, a leaf?

456
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:28,949
Mm-hmm.

457
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,647
That's weird.

458
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:36,489
Maybe she's trying to flatten it
for, like, a scrapbook.

459
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:44,290
Is it flat?

460
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,029
Do you think it's done?

461
00:36:46,103 --> 00:36:49,231
I don't know.
I don't want to mess it up.

462
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:50,934
I should put it back.

463
00:36:57,114 --> 00:36:58,513
You're next.

464
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,523
Kind of, um...

465
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:16,260
kind of cowardly

466
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:18,063
so I don't really
face the problem head on

467
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:20,000
and just say,
"This isn't working."

468
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:27,671
I kind of do this really
half-assed gradual...

469
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:30,612
kind of just maybe try to avoid
the person or ignore them

470
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:32,581
until they figure it out

471
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:35,050
because I'm too afraid
to just do it.

472
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,780
I just want to be--

473
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:40,756
I want what I do and what I feel
to affect only me.

474
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:42,759
I don't want to be responsible
for other people

475
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:44,920
and what they feel, you know?

476
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:46,588
Does that make any sense?

477
00:37:46,663 --> 00:37:48,597
Well, I guess I've been dating
people like you

478
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,657
for the past couple of
relationships until now,

479
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:53,795
and now I'm you.

480
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:55,668
But I don't really like that,

481
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,401
but I do know for sure

482
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:59,568
that I don't want to be
with that person.

483
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:01,305
Yeah.

484
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:02,812
I don't know.

485
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,314
Do you think it's like that

486
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:08,113
we're just kind of, like,
naive and impatient,

487
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:10,085
and then when you get older,

488
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:12,622
you sort of mature
into, like, a person

489
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:17,354
that can actually sustain
a real relationship?

490
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:20,158
Or is it that you just...

491
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:22,927
you know, you're stubborn
when you're young,

492
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,025
and then as you get older,

493
00:38:25,102 --> 00:38:27,832
you kind of lower your standards
and settle?

494
00:38:27,905 --> 00:38:29,805
I hope that's not true.

495
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:32,775
I don't like the latter at all.

496
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:34,640
What was the first one again?

497
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:37,044
You just, you hope that
we're going to grow up?

498
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:42,484
That we'll grow up
and be able to not freak out

499
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:44,350
when it starts to get,
you know, intense

500
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:46,049
and not feel trapped, yeah.

501
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:46,987
Right.

502
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:49,891
And just kind of actually go with it.

503
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,895
Well, this is my first time
feeling like that.

504
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:24,821
My bouncy ball
doesn't work in the grass.

505
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:26,021
Really?

506
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:29,658
Yeah, you try it.

507
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:31,326
It sort of does.

508
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:33,302
Let me try one more time.

509
00:39:37,341 --> 00:39:38,535
That's not very fun.

510
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:40,805
No, it's better on the pavement.

511
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,581
You want to have a race?

512
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:47,446
You want to race?

513
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:48,712
Yeah, I want to race.

514
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:49,718
Are you fast?

515
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:51,049
Maybe.

516
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:52,453
Are you fast?

517
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:53,683
Probably.

518
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:54,952
Probably?

519
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:57,118
All right, where are
we going to race to?

520
00:39:58,462 --> 00:40:02,296
That brown patch of grass
and back.

521
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:03,799
To your jacket?

522
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:05,301
No.

523
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,870
To this.

524
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:08,097
OK.

525
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:09,104
Ready?

526
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:11,607
Hold on. Get behind it.

527
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:12,607
OK, ready?

528
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:14,109
All right, wait.

529
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:16,112
Does it go, "1, 2, 3, go,"

530
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,772
or, "1, 2, 3" and 3 means go?

531
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:19,110
1, 2, 3...go!

532
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:20,115
OK.

533
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:21,674
Ready?

534
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:23,515
1, 2, 3...go.

535
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:53,713
I beat you.

536
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:56,048
I think I swallowed something
on the way back.

537
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,644
Like a bug?

538
00:40:57,721 --> 00:40:59,120
Yeah.

539
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,796
I ran track in high school.

540
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:08,024
Really?

541
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:09,998
Yeah.

542
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:13,093
But I'm out of shape now.

543
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,102
Me, too.

544
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:15,365
But I still beat you!

545
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:18,897
I know. I'm terrible.

546
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:25,442
So I'm not holding you back
from doing anything today, am l?

547
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:26,608
Nope.

548
00:41:26,683 --> 00:41:28,014
You sure?

549
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:29,985
Yep.

550
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:31,578
Well, do you want to go

551
00:41:31,654 --> 00:41:33,815
to my friend Robin's
art gallery tonight?

552
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:37,250
Is it going to be
totally awesome?

553
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,886
Yeah, it's going to be
totally awesome.

554
00:41:38,963 --> 00:41:40,430
Robin's totally awesome.

555
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:41,795
All right, then I'll go.

556
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:43,458
It's at 6:00.

557
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:45,593
It's at 6:00?

558
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:46,897
Mm-hmm.

559
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:53,672
You know what
I could do, actually?

560
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:54,836
What?

561
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:58,404
While we're in the neighborhood,
I could go get my hat.

562
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:02,077
My friend has had
this hat that I own.

563
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:03,050
OK.

564
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,553
And he's had it forever.

565
00:42:04,621 --> 00:42:05,679
OK.

566
00:42:05,756 --> 00:42:08,020
I could get it back from him.

567
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:09,684
Let's get it.

568
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,692
Is that OK?

569
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:13,457
Yeah.

570
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,999
Whatever you want to do.

571
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:18,728
Yeah, let's do that.
You want to go now?

572
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:19,734
Yeah.

573
00:42:19,803 --> 00:42:21,930
I'm still out of breath.

574
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:23,803
Are you?

575
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,535
A little bit.

576
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:49,021
Which one is it?

577
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:50,396
4-D.

578
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:56,429
Those are sort of backwards.

579
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:06,346
Maybe he's not here.

580
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,850
Hello?

581
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:10,682
Hey, man, it's Charlie.

582
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:14,121
I was taking a nap.

583
00:43:14,191 --> 00:43:16,091
Oh, sorry.

584
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:21,655
Um, I don't know,
can we come up?

585
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:23,962
What? Did you say,
"Can we come up?"

586
00:43:24,034 --> 00:43:25,729
Yeah.

587
00:43:25,803 --> 00:43:27,634
Who are you with?

588
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:32,039
Um, my friend.

589
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:35,340
Who's your friend?

590
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:36,606
Open the door, please.

591
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:42,842
What?
I can't understand you.

592
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:46,588
I don't know.

593
00:43:46,657 --> 00:43:50,115
Come on,
can we please come in?

594
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:52,321
Did I hear a girl's voice?

595
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:54,387
Yeah.

596
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:57,628
Who are you, stranger?

597
00:43:57,701 --> 00:44:00,033
I think he said,
"Who are you, stranger?"

598
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:01,435
I'm Jamie.

599
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:11,280
Hey, Charlie, my friend.

600
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:13,373
Hold on.
Step back from the peep hole.

601
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:14,508
Are you serious?

602
00:44:14,584 --> 00:44:16,814
I can't focus you.

603
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:19,151
Hey, buddy, how's it going?

604
00:44:19,223 --> 00:44:20,087
How you doin', man?

605
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:23,752
Good. Good to see you.
It's been a long time.

606
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:25,852
Hey, you guys
got to take your shoes off.

607
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:27,863
It's a house rule.

608
00:44:27,931 --> 00:44:29,023
Are you serious?

609
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:30,361
Yeah.

610
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:33,870
No shoes on the rug
or beyond this point, basically.

611
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:34,869
OK.

612
00:44:34,938 --> 00:44:35,870
Come on in.

613
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:37,031
My name is Adam.

614
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:38,039
I'm Jamie.

615
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:39,040
Nice to meet you.

616
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:40,872
Wow, that's a strong handshake.

617
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:41,876
Boy.

618
00:44:41,945 --> 00:44:43,003
Uh...

619
00:44:46,283 --> 00:44:48,774
Charlie, today, man.

620
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:49,841
Sorry.

621
00:44:51,388 --> 00:44:52,912
What do you got there?

622
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:54,116
Got where?

623
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:55,681
Never mind.

624
00:44:55,759 --> 00:44:58,592
They're stool coasters,
chair coasters.

625
00:44:58,663 --> 00:45:01,257
I don't know what they're called.

626
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:04,494
Jess likes them,
but, you know,

627
00:45:04,569 --> 00:45:08,801
'cause they keep the rug smooth,
but you can see them, you know.

628
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:10,863
You don't like
that you can see them?

629
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:11,873
Well, I don't care.

630
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:12,840
I'm just saying
you can see them.

631
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:13,842
I like your curtains here.

632
00:45:13,911 --> 00:45:15,435
Did you pick all this stuff out?

633
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:16,570
I did not.

634
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:19,411
I picked out very little
of this stuff.

635
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:21,383
Who picked it out?
Your girlfriend?

636
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:23,044
My future wife.

637
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,384
Wow. Since when?

638
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:26,582
Since when?

639
00:45:26,656 --> 00:45:30,023
Um, since...

640
00:45:30,094 --> 00:45:34,030
June is when I proposed,

641
00:45:34,098 --> 00:45:37,226
is when I got down
on one knee and...

642
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:39,030
what do you say?

643
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:43,096
Made it...made, uh...

644
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,271
Made her an honest woman.

645
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:48,276
I don't know.

646
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:49,471
Guys don't wear rings, though.

647
00:45:49,545 --> 00:45:50,773
There's no way...

648
00:45:50,848 --> 00:45:51,906
To know.

649
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:53,108
Yeah.

650
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:55,310
How long have you been dating?

651
00:45:55,385 --> 00:45:58,149
Seven years.

652
00:45:58,222 --> 00:45:58,950
Impressive, right?

653
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:00,455
It's a long time.

654
00:46:00,523 --> 00:46:02,115
It's almost, like,
embarrassingly long

655
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:04,319
to now finally be engaged.

656
00:46:04,394 --> 00:46:06,055
You wanted to be engaged...

657
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:07,722
Well, it's like, you know,

658
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:09,265
once you've reached
the seven-year point

659
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:11,426
and then you're like,
"Oh, now we're engaged?"

660
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:14,596
It's like we might as well have
gotten engaged four years ago.

661
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:17,834
He really just found out
she had all this nice shit.

662
00:46:17,908 --> 00:46:20,376
Yeah, I found that out.

663
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:23,345
She finally invited me
into her place,

664
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:25,540
and I was like, "Whoa,
you've got a cool apartment.

665
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,015
Can I live here?"

666
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:28,449
Out came the ring.

667
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:29,816
Yeah.

668
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:31,650
Uh, Charlie?

669
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:33,280
Adam.

670
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:35,257
What are you doing here?

671
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:38,089
Um, I just thought
I'd pay you a visit.

672
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:41,928
No, I actually...I wanted to get
my hat that you've had for ages

673
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:44,968
that I am going to need
to reclaim.

674
00:46:45,035 --> 00:46:48,061
That figures that
the first time I see you--

675
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:49,935
How does that figure?

676
00:46:50,007 --> 00:46:53,135
You're all locked up
in paradise here.

677
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:55,007
I've got your hat.

678
00:46:55,078 --> 00:46:56,170
Thank you.

679
00:46:56,246 --> 00:46:57,577
You're welcome.

680
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,224
Are you invited
to the wedding?

681
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:10,658
Yeah, of course.

682
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:12,627
Are you going to be
the best man?

683
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:14,527
Um, I don't think so.

684
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:16,567
I think somebody else
snatched it.

685
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,702
I appreciate the use
of that fine hat.

686
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:23,296
How did it
work out for you?

687
00:47:23,373 --> 00:47:24,305
It worked out great.

688
00:47:24,374 --> 00:47:25,602
That's a great hat.

689
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,769
Hey, are you guys hungry?

690
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,506
Do you guys like cole slaw?

691
00:47:29,581 --> 00:47:30,513
Yeah.

692
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:31,842
You want some?

693
00:47:31,915 --> 00:47:33,109
I've got this great cole slaw

694
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:34,980
that I'm actually
really hungry for.

695
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:37,782
And so I figure if I'm going to
go get myself some...

696
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:40,119
I feel like cole slaw
is not something

697
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:42,920
that our generation
really appreciates

698
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:44,688
as its own thing.

699
00:47:44,761 --> 00:47:47,059
I get it for sides
at restaurants all the time.

700
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:48,563
Yeah, but it's a side.

701
00:47:48,632 --> 00:47:50,566
It's been relegated to the sides
of other meals.

702
00:47:50,635 --> 00:47:52,796
But I'm saying I just sometimes
eat cole slaw.

703
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,394
Like a salad of cole slaw?

704
00:47:54,471 --> 00:47:55,870
Not like anything.

705
00:47:55,939 --> 00:47:59,739
Just a big old bowl of cole slaw.

706
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:00,640
It's good, right?

707
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:02,372
Yep.

708
00:48:02,446 --> 00:48:04,346
There's more
where that came from.

709
00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:06,006
Eat up.

710
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:25,801
Where's your hat?

711
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:27,598
Oh!

712
00:48:50,327 --> 00:48:51,726
What's that?

713
00:48:51,795 --> 00:48:52,887
My electric bill,

714
00:48:52,963 --> 00:48:56,922
but it's, like, always incorrect.

715
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,492
I need a...

716
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:03,630
something to spread the mayo.

717
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:07,934
Use this.

718
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:11,640
Yeah, but we just used that.

719
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:21,918
Is yours delicious?

720
00:49:21,992 --> 00:49:23,550
It's pretty awesome.

721
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:24,787
Is it?

722
00:49:24,861 --> 00:49:26,556
Yeah.

723
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,757
Are you afraid to try this?

724
00:49:28,832 --> 00:49:30,459
To what?

725
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:31,933
To try this?

726
00:49:32,002 --> 00:49:33,833
Sort of.

727
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:36,737
That is a slathering
of the mayonnaise and mustard.

728
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,240
Eat your own sandwich!

729
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:39,673
I am.

730
00:49:42,611 --> 00:49:44,636
OK, I'm going to
cut it in half first.

731
00:49:58,428 --> 00:50:01,693
This is the worst game
I've ever played.

732
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:07,363
That's funny.

733
00:50:07,437 --> 00:50:09,905
Isn't that good?

734
00:50:09,973 --> 00:50:11,099
That's kind of enjoyable.

735
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:12,106
I know.

736
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:14,769
Can I take a shower?
Do you mind?

737
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:15,834
No.

738
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,714
Hey, Charlie?

739
00:50:59,122 --> 00:51:00,555
Charlie?

740
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:20,221
Oh, my God! Jamie!

741
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:25,758
I can't believe you came!

742
00:53:25,835 --> 00:53:26,767
You look great!

743
00:53:26,836 --> 00:53:28,303
It's so good to see you...

744
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:29,702
It's great to see you, too!

745
00:53:29,773 --> 00:53:30,899
...in New York!

746
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:32,498
I'm so excited to be here!

747
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:41,141
I have this friend, Paul,

748
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:44,585
who kind of treads
the androgyny line,

749
00:53:44,654 --> 00:53:47,623
and I was sort of
inspired by him.

750
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:50,158
Um, I think I'm going to get
another one...

751
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:51,694
Which one?

752
00:53:51,761 --> 00:53:53,160
The blue and green one.

753
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:54,754
It's, like, the only one

754
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:57,026
that I really can, like,
definitely say I'm proud of.

755
00:54:14,351 --> 00:54:15,716
Charlie Miller.

756
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:17,013
Ha ha!

757
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,952
What the fuck is up, buddy?

758
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:20,011
How's it going?

759
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,614
What the fuck
are you doing here?

760
00:54:21,691 --> 00:54:22,623
Nothing, you know.

761
00:54:22,692 --> 00:54:23,784
Checking out some art.

762
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:24,952
Yeah?

763
00:54:25,028 --> 00:54:26,393
Yeah.

764
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:27,794
Are you writing a paper?

765
00:54:27,864 --> 00:54:28,796
What?

766
00:54:28,865 --> 00:54:30,162
Are you writing a paper?

767
00:54:30,233 --> 00:54:31,200
On...

768
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:32,200
The art?

769
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:33,099
No.

770
00:54:33,169 --> 00:54:34,500
I don't think I've seen you
come out of Park Slope

771
00:54:34,571 --> 00:54:37,039
in what, like a month?

772
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:39,337
Uh, I leave.
I come out.

773
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:40,398
Yeah?

774
00:54:40,478 --> 00:54:42,002
Get the paper
or something like that?

775
00:54:42,078 --> 00:54:42,874
I'm out right now.

776
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:45,005
Yeah, you are right now.

777
00:54:45,081 --> 00:54:46,810
Well, why don't you
call me back sometime?

778
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:48,180
What do you mean?

779
00:54:48,251 --> 00:54:50,583
Like I don't know,
I called you like two weeks ago.

780
00:54:50,654 --> 00:54:52,281
Still haven't heard from you.

781
00:54:52,355 --> 00:54:54,755
No, seriously,
like, what are you doing?

782
00:54:54,824 --> 00:54:56,849
I mean, I haven't seen you
in, like, a month.

783
00:54:56,926 --> 00:54:58,450
I don't know.

784
00:54:58,528 --> 00:55:00,120
I mean, I've been kind of...

785
00:55:00,196 --> 00:55:02,824
well, I haven't really
been that busy.

786
00:55:02,899 --> 00:55:04,332
Just forget it.

787
00:55:04,401 --> 00:55:05,868
Who the fuck is this?

788
00:55:07,203 --> 00:55:09,364
I'm Jamie. Hi.

789
00:55:09,439 --> 00:55:10,667
Hi.

790
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,966
So what are you...
how'd you end up here?

791
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:16,569
You just were like, "Hey, I want
to come out of Park Slope

792
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:18,274
for the first time in a year,
so I'm going to go to an art show"?

793
00:55:18,348 --> 00:55:21,613
Well, no, her friend
is actually...

794
00:55:21,685 --> 00:55:22,982
Yeah, Robin did...

795
00:55:23,053 --> 00:55:24,520
Oh, Robin's your friend?

796
00:55:24,587 --> 00:55:26,578
Yeah, from high school.

797
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:29,022
Yeah, I know Robin.
That's why I'm here.

798
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:30,059
Oh, great.

799
00:55:30,126 --> 00:55:31,650
I met Robin, like, a year ago.

800
00:55:31,728 --> 00:55:33,662
It was one of those, like,
here's some rock bands

801
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:35,459
and here's some art
and here's some, you know,

802
00:55:35,533 --> 00:55:37,433
face painting,
and get some cotton candy--

803
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,364
this little carnival thing.

804
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:39,732
That's awesome.

805
00:55:39,803 --> 00:55:41,100
It was, like, over on the piers.

806
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:41,899
OK.

807
00:55:41,971 --> 00:55:42,630
Are you from here?

808
00:55:42,706 --> 00:55:44,867
No, no,
I'm from Atlanta actually.

809
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:47,102
I was here visiting not Robin,
but another friend,

810
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,940
who I can't find, so...

811
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,138
Isn't Robin from Atlanta?

812
00:55:50,213 --> 00:55:51,475
Yeah, she is.

813
00:55:51,548 --> 00:55:53,675
So you've known her
for, like, a long time, right?

814
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:55,650
Yeah, we pretty much
grew up together.

815
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:56,708
Was she always like that?

816
00:55:56,786 --> 00:55:58,151
Like too cool for school
and all that?

817
00:55:58,221 --> 00:55:59,745
Too cool for school?
Kind of.

818
00:55:59,823 --> 00:56:00,915
That's kind of Robin.

819
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:02,890
But maybe now more so--
her hair.

820
00:56:02,959 --> 00:56:04,483
I haven't seen her hair like that.

821
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:05,789
What do you do?

822
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:09,263
Well, right now I work
at, um, a restaurant.

823
00:56:09,332 --> 00:56:13,393
Oh, yeah?
What kind of restaurant?

824
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:15,097
A chain restaurant.

825
00:56:15,171 --> 00:56:16,763
What do you mean
"a chain restaurant"?

826
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,603
Like Long John Silver's?

827
00:56:18,676 --> 00:56:20,473
Not quite.

828
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:23,445
Like at the drive-thru,
you're like, "No fish sticks."

829
00:56:23,513 --> 00:56:25,140
Applebee's, actually.

830
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,739
Applebee's!

831
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:36,219
You're not gearing up to what,
go back to Florida, are you?

832
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:37,418
What?

833
00:56:37,494 --> 00:56:39,428
Last time I talked to you,
you said you were like,

834
00:56:39,496 --> 00:56:41,521
"Oh, I'm moving back to Florida,
I'm done with this," and all that,

835
00:56:41,598 --> 00:56:44,328
"it's too cold up here,
I hate it."

836
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:46,028
I didn't know that.

837
00:56:46,102 --> 00:56:48,832
No, he's, like, hung up
on some girl back in Florida.

838
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:50,099
No, I'm not.

839
00:56:50,173 --> 00:56:52,004
Whatever. You talk about her,
like, all the time.

840
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,474
No, I don't!
No, I don't!

841
00:56:53,543 --> 00:56:55,340
I'm just saying, I mean,
if you move back to Florida,

842
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:56,401
I'm just letting you know
right now

843
00:56:56,479 --> 00:56:59,312
that that means officially
you and I are no longer friends.

844
00:56:59,382 --> 00:57:01,077
That's all. That's all.

845
00:57:01,151 --> 00:57:02,709
Well, thanks a lot for that.

846
00:57:02,786 --> 00:57:05,186
It's just a rule I have to make.

847
00:57:11,127 --> 00:57:13,925
This is my good friend,
so you better be nice to her.

848
00:57:13,997 --> 00:57:15,589
Jamie. Yeah, I met Jamie.

849
00:57:15,665 --> 00:57:18,099
He's been OK.
Not too bad.

850
00:57:18,168 --> 00:57:19,601
I had my shots today.

851
00:57:19,669 --> 00:57:21,102
I'm totally right.

852
00:57:21,171 --> 00:57:22,695
Your shots, or your shots?

853
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:23,796
No, both.

854
00:57:23,873 --> 00:57:25,204
OK.

855
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:26,503
That's good work.

856
00:57:26,576 --> 00:57:27,634
Thanks.

857
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:29,143
Is that sincere?

858
00:57:29,212 --> 00:57:32,443
Do you...
so do you know Robin?

859
00:57:32,515 --> 00:57:33,743
No, we just met.

860
00:57:33,817 --> 00:57:34,749
Oh, OK.

861
00:57:34,818 --> 00:57:36,410
Me and him, way back.

862
00:57:36,486 --> 00:57:37,680
Yeah, sure.

863
00:57:37,754 --> 00:57:38,846
Ar, ar.

864
00:57:38,922 --> 00:57:40,446
Really?

865
00:57:40,523 --> 00:57:41,148
Yeah.

866
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:42,213
Like this.

867
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,726
High school, middle school...

868
00:57:44,793 --> 00:57:46,158
Isn't that kind of weird

869
00:57:46,229 --> 00:57:48,857
that they go back
and we go back?

870
00:57:48,932 --> 00:57:50,490
You guys know--
for real?

871
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:52,398
Yeah, Charlie Miller.

872
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,960
Tell me something
about Charlie.

873
00:57:55,038 --> 00:57:55,970
Charlie used to--

874
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:57,165
Wait, wait, wait.

875
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,538
OK, uh, tell me...

876
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:02,406
tell me something
that you know about Charlie

877
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:05,243
from hanging out with him
for a day,

878
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:06,942
and then we'll ask,

879
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:09,211
we'll ask Kyle,
because I don't believe him.

880
00:58:09,285 --> 00:58:10,616
Should I whisper it to you?

881
00:58:10,687 --> 00:58:12,154
Yeah, whisper it to me.

882
00:58:12,222 --> 00:58:13,849
All right, all right.

883
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:18,519
What have you been doing
for the past day?

884
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:19,892
Nothing.

885
00:58:19,963 --> 00:58:21,555
We've just been hanging out.

886
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:24,657
OK, What is Charlie's
least favorite aspect

887
00:58:24,734 --> 00:58:26,702
of getting his hair cut?

888
00:58:26,769 --> 00:58:29,203
Um, any part of it--

889
00:58:29,272 --> 00:58:32,537
paying for it.

890
00:58:32,609 --> 00:58:34,076
So you're saying he's stingy.

891
00:58:34,143 --> 00:58:36,509
The back, the back--
making the back look right.

892
00:58:36,578 --> 00:58:39,376
No, it's wrong.
It's the itchy hair.

893
00:58:39,449 --> 00:58:41,781
He doesn't like having
itchy hair down his shirt.

894
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:44,217
I never cut his hair
when we were in high school

895
00:58:44,287 --> 00:58:45,447
or middle school

896
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:47,387
because that's not something
you do.

897
00:58:47,457 --> 00:58:48,981
Like who does that,

898
00:58:49,058 --> 00:58:51,526
like, "Hey, guy, let's put
this Nintendo 64 down

899
00:58:51,594 --> 00:58:53,357
and cut each other's hair"?

900
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:54,726
Who does that?

901
00:58:54,797 --> 00:58:55,923
Friends.

902
00:58:55,999 --> 00:58:57,591
We've gotten
our hair cut together.

903
00:58:57,667 --> 00:58:59,100
OK, you're girls.

904
00:58:59,168 --> 00:59:01,227
I've cut her hair, actually.

905
00:59:01,304 --> 00:59:04,171
What guy, except for the military,
gets their hair cut together?

906
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,434
I mean, seriously.

907
00:59:05,509 --> 00:59:06,771
So you guys really--

908
00:59:06,843 --> 00:59:08,071
I'll give you $20.

909
00:59:08,144 --> 00:59:09,441
Go find me a guy

910
00:59:09,512 --> 00:59:11,844
who got his hair cut with
his friend on a regular basis,

911
00:59:11,915 --> 00:59:13,780
enough to know he doesn't like
what, itchy hair?

912
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:15,818
How does she know that?

913
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:17,477
Is that even true?

914
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:19,021
I don't like it.

915
00:59:19,088 --> 00:59:20,817
She gave me a haircut, man.

916
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,721
I thought you met her yesterday!

917
00:59:22,791 --> 00:59:24,452
It was yesterday.

918
00:59:24,527 --> 00:59:26,051
What is wrong with you?

919
00:59:26,129 --> 00:59:27,721
You just meet some girl
and you're like,

920
00:59:27,797 --> 00:59:30,231
"Hey, what's up?
Cut my hair, girl."

921
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:31,733
You can't even tell.

922
00:59:31,801 --> 00:59:36,898
That's like a $200 haircut
in this city.

923
00:59:36,973 --> 00:59:38,998
You gave her $200
for that haircut?

924
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:41,703
That will be $250.

925
00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:43,871
I barely did anything.
I was a little nervous.

926
00:59:43,947 --> 00:59:45,778
Can you cut my hair?

927
00:59:45,848 --> 00:59:47,713
I thought you worked
at Applebee's.

928
00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:48,751
You cut hair, too?

929
00:59:48,818 --> 00:59:51,048
Yeah, I do, on the side.

930
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,052
Kyle, be nice.

931
00:59:52,121 --> 00:59:53,418
She brought it up.

932
00:59:53,489 --> 00:59:55,889
I didn't tell you
to be rude to my friend.

933
00:59:55,959 --> 00:59:58,018
Do you guys, like,
want to leave soon?

934
00:59:58,094 --> 00:59:59,026
Sure.

935
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:01,586
I'm just kind of...

936
01:00:01,664 --> 01:00:03,791
OK.

937
01:00:03,866 --> 01:00:04,992
Yeah?

938
01:00:05,068 --> 01:00:06,535
Are you guys coming?

939
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:07,797
Where?

940
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:09,064
Ah, I think, actually,

941
01:00:09,138 --> 01:00:11,106
a bunch of people
are coming to my house later,

942
01:00:11,174 --> 01:00:13,438
but it'll be a little while.

943
01:00:13,509 --> 01:00:16,342
Do you just want to sort of
chill out and listen to music?

944
01:03:03,813 --> 01:03:05,337
We got a girl.

945
01:03:05,414 --> 01:03:06,540
Ask the girl.

946
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:09,949
If you meet some strange guy
and you go home--

947
01:03:10,019 --> 01:03:11,384
I'm not a strange guy.

948
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:13,012
He's not that strange.

949
01:03:13,089 --> 01:03:14,556
He's a stranger.

950
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:15,921
And you go home with him,

951
01:03:15,992 --> 01:03:18,051
and you sleep over
at his house,

952
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:19,924
doesn't that mean
you kind of dig him?

953
01:03:19,996 --> 01:03:21,486
Yeah.

954
01:03:26,635 --> 01:03:28,500
OK, ready?

955
01:03:34,177 --> 01:03:35,872
Let me see.

956
01:03:35,945 --> 01:03:38,413
Do you know Robin?

957
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:39,641
Uh, not really.

958
01:03:39,715 --> 01:03:41,512
I went with a friend of hers,

959
01:03:41,584 --> 01:03:43,882
and I mean,
I subsequently met her,

960
01:03:43,953 --> 01:03:45,750
but I don't know her very well.

961
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:47,756
Do you live in the city?

962
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:49,621
Yeah, I live in Park Slope.

963
01:03:49,692 --> 01:03:50,624
Nice.

964
01:03:50,692 --> 01:03:52,159
I live in Park Slope, too.

965
01:03:52,228 --> 01:03:55,061
That's a lovely place to be.

966
01:03:55,131 --> 01:03:57,122
Yeah, it's great.

967
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,600
And what do you do?

968
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:02,536
As of right now, not much.

969
01:04:02,604 --> 01:04:05,903
I actually, I just quit my job
a few weeks ago,

970
01:04:05,975 --> 01:04:10,173
and I've just kind of been
slinking around, you know.

971
01:04:10,246 --> 01:04:12,271
I've heard of that.

972
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:14,179
I think I've done that.

973
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:16,718
Actually I'm doing that, too,
to be honest--

974
01:04:16,786 --> 01:04:18,219
slinking around.

975
01:04:18,287 --> 01:04:19,948
How's it going for you?

976
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:24,254
It's not paying the rent, really,
but I'm hoping someday it will.

977
01:04:24,327 --> 01:04:26,761
I'm waiting
for the glory to come.

978
01:04:26,829 --> 01:04:28,888
Yeah, we need to devise a plot

979
01:04:28,965 --> 01:04:31,593
to where we can basically do
absolutely nothing

980
01:04:31,667 --> 01:04:33,157
and get our bills paid.

981
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:36,265
I don't know.

982
01:04:36,339 --> 01:04:37,601
What happened?

983
01:04:37,673 --> 01:04:38,605
Nothing.

984
01:04:38,674 --> 01:04:39,663
Nothing happened?

985
01:04:39,742 --> 01:04:41,107
No, I mean,
some stuff happened.

986
01:04:41,177 --> 01:04:42,109
What happened?

987
01:04:42,178 --> 01:04:44,612
I don't know.
Just some stuff.

988
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:46,807
What? You don't have to tell me.

989
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:49,113
I didn't sleep with him, though.

990
01:04:49,185 --> 01:04:51,119
But the thing is
that, like, you know,

991
01:04:51,187 --> 01:04:56,124
I've just sort of had,
like, a hard time, um...

992
01:04:56,192 --> 01:05:00,128
crossing that line a little bit,
and I don't really know why.

993
01:05:00,196 --> 01:05:03,324
Like a lot of, like, my,
like, recent boyfriends,

994
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:09,599
like, I've just had, like,
such an intense connection

995
01:05:09,672 --> 01:05:11,105
to them kind of emotionally

996
01:05:11,173 --> 01:05:16,736
and we just talk about
so much stuff that l, um...

997
01:05:16,812 --> 01:05:19,645
it's sort of hard for me
to, like, imagine,

998
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:23,515
like, being sort of, like,
sexy with them

999
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:26,316
when, like, it's sort of like
it's all, like, cute

1000
01:05:26,389 --> 01:05:28,687
and, like, sweet
and, like, intense

1001
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:30,749
but like in a cerebral way,
kind of.

1002
01:05:30,826 --> 01:05:32,316
You, like, see these,
like, movies

1003
01:05:32,395 --> 01:05:34,863
and, like, these sex scenes
are, like, so animalistic,

1004
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:38,697
and l, like, don't...
I don't know.

1005
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:40,167
I just, like, don't--

1006
01:05:40,236 --> 01:05:44,935
I can't, like, I can't reconcile,
like, something like that

1007
01:05:45,007 --> 01:05:46,941
with, like, something like
what I've had with these people

1008
01:05:47,009 --> 01:05:48,408
that I've sort of had, like,

1009
01:05:48,477 --> 01:05:51,002
a little bit longer term
relationships with, you know.

1010
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:52,104
Mm-hmm.

1011
01:05:52,181 --> 01:05:55,514
Um, so I guess
I decided recently

1012
01:05:55,584 --> 01:05:58,280
that, like, what I really needed
was, like, someone,

1013
01:05:58,354 --> 01:06:01,755
like, totally hot,
like, unquestionably hot

1014
01:06:01,824 --> 01:06:04,850
that was kind of a jerk maybe
and so I could just get over it.

1015
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:07,191
So you could cross the line--

1016
01:06:07,263 --> 01:06:09,595
Well, maybe just get over
some of it, you know,

1017
01:06:09,665 --> 01:06:12,361
because, like--and someone maybe
who I didn't have to...

1018
01:06:12,435 --> 01:06:16,235
like, I would never do anything
with anyone

1019
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:18,432
who, like, I didn't feel,
like, a connection to,

1020
01:06:18,507 --> 01:06:22,603
but I kind of just wanted, like,
to not have to worry about...

1021
01:06:22,678 --> 01:06:24,805
like, I didn't want this,
like, long history,

1022
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,609
like, I didn't want
all these memories of us,

1023
01:06:26,682 --> 01:06:28,206
like, sort of having, like,
this, you know,

1024
01:06:28,284 --> 01:06:29,581
psychological stuff going on.

1025
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:31,779
I just wanted it to be, like,
sort of more visceral.

1026
01:06:31,854 --> 01:06:33,845
I think that's what I need.

1027
01:06:39,428 --> 01:06:42,727
I've had some drinks,
I will confess.

1028
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:44,231
What's your drink of choice?

1029
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:47,861
Well, the gallery
had beer, so I drank that.

1030
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:52,237
And, um, there was a few nips
of something along the way.

1031
01:06:52,308 --> 01:06:54,970
I don't know,
I haven't really been--

1032
01:06:55,044 --> 01:06:57,911
Like illicit nips,
or liquid nips?

1033
01:06:57,980 --> 01:06:59,242
Liquid.

1034
01:06:59,315 --> 01:07:00,839
What would be illicit?

1035
01:07:00,916 --> 01:07:04,352
Well, there's, you know,
there's pills, there's powders,

1036
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:05,682
there's pipes...

1037
01:07:05,755 --> 01:07:07,188
No, none of that.

1038
01:07:07,256 --> 01:07:09,781
Strictly something
you put in a glass.

1039
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:11,918
And is legal.

1040
01:07:11,994 --> 01:07:13,461
Yeah.

1041
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:15,759
But, uh...

1042
01:07:15,831 --> 01:07:19,790
like, I remember
this one time,

1043
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:22,064
um, I was sitting in that chair
over there,

1044
01:07:22,138 --> 01:07:26,438
and he was, like, lying on
his stomach, like, on the bed,

1045
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:28,670
and we were just
listening to music and stuff,

1046
01:07:28,744 --> 01:07:30,006
and l, like...

1047
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:32,343
I never would have, like,
asked anyone this before,

1048
01:07:32,415 --> 01:07:35,543
but he was lying on his stomach,
like, reading a book,

1049
01:07:35,619 --> 01:07:38,110
and I was just like, "Hey,
Scott, can I ask you something?"

1050
01:07:38,187 --> 01:07:39,711
and he's, like, "What?"

1051
01:07:39,789 --> 01:07:45,455
And I was like, "Can I just,
like, lay on top of you?"

1052
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:46,585
What did he say?

1053
01:07:46,662 --> 01:07:49,825
He was, like, "Uh...OK."

1054
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:53,767
So l, like, came over here
and, like, just laid,

1055
01:07:53,836 --> 01:07:57,602
like, directly, like, stacked,
like, right on top of him

1056
01:07:57,673 --> 01:08:01,973
and just laid on top of him,
and, like, we talked for a while.

1057
01:08:02,044 --> 01:08:03,875
And I just remember thinking,
like, you know,

1058
01:08:03,946 --> 01:08:07,279
like one of my roommates,
like, here,

1059
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:09,442
like, has never even
had a boyfriend,

1060
01:08:09,518 --> 01:08:11,452
and, like, I just remember,
like, saying to him,

1061
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,215
"Like, this, like, feels really good.

1062
01:08:13,289 --> 01:08:14,813
Like, I don't even
know you that well.

1063
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:15,754
It just feels really good

1064
01:08:15,825 --> 01:08:19,659
to, like, be, like,
close to someone and stuff."

1065
01:08:19,728 --> 01:08:23,129
And it wasn't, like,
really, like, a sexual thing.

1066
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:25,463
It was kind of like
I was fully clothed,

1067
01:08:25,534 --> 01:08:27,024
just, like, laying on top of him,

1068
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:28,400
and I was just like,

1069
01:08:28,471 --> 01:08:31,497
I just sort of felt,
like, sort of sad in that moment

1070
01:08:31,574 --> 01:08:33,872
for, like, people who, like,
don't have,

1071
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:35,376
like, that, like, contact ever.

1072
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:36,809
You know what I mean?

1073
01:08:36,879 --> 01:08:38,608
Because, like, in a sense,
like, it was like,

1074
01:08:38,681 --> 01:08:40,410
in a sense
it was, like, all I needed.

1075
01:08:40,483 --> 01:08:42,474
Like I didn't even need,
like, I didn't even need,

1076
01:08:42,551 --> 01:08:44,815
like, to get over,
like, all this stuff really.

1077
01:08:44,887 --> 01:08:46,821
Like, I think that's really
just what I needed

1078
01:08:46,889 --> 01:08:48,015
was just, like, closeness

1079
01:08:48,090 --> 01:08:49,421
and, like, being, like,
comfortable with someone,

1080
01:08:49,492 --> 01:08:51,357
and I think that's
why it was so hard

1081
01:08:51,427 --> 01:08:54,123
to, like, say the things
that I said to him that night,

1082
01:08:54,196 --> 01:08:58,792
like, when I sort of told him
that I couldn't do it anymore.

1083
01:08:58,868 --> 01:09:00,199
I talked to this girl,

1084
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:01,998
and her dad, like,
runs some old carpet place,

1085
01:09:02,071 --> 01:09:05,302
and she can get, like, remnants,
like, old carpet pieces

1086
01:09:05,374 --> 01:09:06,807
and then just, like,
sew the edges.

1087
01:09:06,876 --> 01:09:08,468
It's, like, 50 bucks
to sew the edges.

1088
01:09:08,544 --> 01:09:11,069
So I got, like, a bunch
of, like, little weird rugs.

1089
01:09:19,555 --> 01:09:21,318
I feel really bad.

1090
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:23,085
No, you should not feel bad.

1091
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:25,093
I just have this class tomorrow.

1092
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:26,185
Oh, my God.

1093
01:09:26,262 --> 01:09:28,856
You should have told me
you had class tomorrow.

1094
01:09:40,042 --> 01:09:41,532
Hey.

1095
01:09:41,609 --> 01:09:42,871
How's it going?

1096
01:09:42,945 --> 01:09:43,877
Good.

1097
01:09:43,946 --> 01:09:46,676
I'm just...

1098
01:09:46,749 --> 01:09:47,773
Enjoying the taps?

1099
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:49,909
Oh, yeah, messin' around.

1100
01:09:49,985 --> 01:09:52,146
What have you been doing?

1101
01:09:52,221 --> 01:09:54,314
Nothing, just walking around.

1102
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:55,914
Talk to anybody interesting?

1103
01:09:55,991 --> 01:09:57,424
Talked to the same folks.

1104
01:09:57,493 --> 01:09:58,755
Folks.

1105
01:09:58,827 --> 01:10:01,762
But no, you can't really get
into anything that important

1106
01:10:01,830 --> 01:10:05,163
in this environment,
can you?

1107
01:10:05,234 --> 01:10:07,065
Depending.

1108
01:10:07,136 --> 01:10:10,902
Depending if, you know, what
both people want to talk about.

1109
01:10:17,613 --> 01:10:19,808
What's that for?

1110
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:21,008
Your concert.

1111
01:10:21,083 --> 01:10:22,778
My playing?

1112
01:10:22,851 --> 01:10:24,375
I was kind of trying to be quiet.

1113
01:10:24,453 --> 01:10:25,681
Watch.

1114
01:10:25,755 --> 01:10:27,620
This is a good technique
for high-five.

1115
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:29,954
If you look at my elbow
and I look at yours,

1116
01:10:30,025 --> 01:10:32,016
supposedly
we'll connect better.

1117
01:10:32,094 --> 01:10:33,789
Instead of hands.

1118
01:10:33,862 --> 01:10:36,194
Yeah, like, don't look
at my hand when you move.

1119
01:10:36,265 --> 01:10:37,994
Look at my elbow,
and I'll look at yours.

1120
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:38,999
OK, ready?

1121
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:40,228
Ready, go.

1122
01:10:40,302 --> 01:10:42,327
Wait, hold on.

1123
01:10:43,505 --> 01:10:44,437
OK.

1124
01:10:44,506 --> 01:10:45,996
Do it again.

1125
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:49,272
You know, I mean, I don't want
to, like, stop your fun.

1126
01:10:49,345 --> 01:10:51,313
You should have
told me earlier

1127
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:55,544
when I said
about the sort of party.

1128
01:10:55,618 --> 01:10:59,247
Maybe if we could, like,
lower the music or something,

1129
01:10:59,321 --> 01:11:01,016
and you can blame it on me.

1130
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:03,217
You can tell everybody that
I'm a horrendous awful...

1131
01:11:03,292 --> 01:11:05,522
No, you're not
a horrendous awful.

1132
01:11:05,594 --> 01:11:07,391
I would never say that!

1133
01:11:07,463 --> 01:11:09,328
I would never
say that.

1134
01:11:09,398 --> 01:11:11,059
You have to find it.

1135
01:11:11,133 --> 01:11:14,830
It's, like, way back here.

1136
01:11:14,903 --> 01:11:15,631
This thing?

1137
01:11:15,703 --> 01:11:18,365
Yeah.

1138
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,533
Make it as tight as possible.

1139
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:27,643
I'm giving the doubled up...

1140
01:11:27,716 --> 01:11:29,377
It's like, here's the single one--

1141
01:11:29,451 --> 01:11:30,509
Not this one.

1142
01:11:30,586 --> 01:11:31,518
Yeah, I know.

1143
01:11:31,587 --> 01:11:32,986
This one.

1144
01:11:33,055 --> 01:11:34,682
You just have to...

1145
01:11:34,758 --> 01:11:36,089
I don't know how
to describe it.

1146
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:37,056
You just...

1147
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:39,754
I'm doing it.

1148
01:11:39,828 --> 01:11:41,056
Yeah...

1149
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:43,894
You said, "I'm doin' it."

1150
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:45,627
I'm doin' it.

1151
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:09,756
OK.

1152
01:12:09,825 --> 01:12:10,723
Looks good.

1153
01:12:10,793 --> 01:12:11,851
Thanks.

1154
01:12:11,927 --> 01:12:13,952
When is your birthday officially?

1155
01:12:14,029 --> 01:12:16,657
My birthday is October 28.

1156
01:12:16,732 --> 01:12:19,462
I just have a dollar,
but I can sign it if you want.

1157
01:12:19,535 --> 01:12:21,560
OK. Can you sign it?

1158
01:12:21,636 --> 01:12:23,365
The good thing about that
is I can cash--

1159
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:24,371
well, it is cash.

1160
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:25,464
I can't cash this.

1161
01:12:25,541 --> 01:12:27,236
This is a totally
erroneous present,

1162
01:12:27,309 --> 01:12:28,537
as far as I'm concerned.

1163
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:30,544
That's why you should just
smash it over your head.

1164
01:12:30,612 --> 01:12:31,544
But it's not erroneous.

1165
01:12:31,613 --> 01:12:32,602
I like it, though.

1166
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:34,148
That was nice of him
to give it to me.

1167
01:12:34,216 --> 01:12:34,807
Do you want the dollar or not?

1168
01:12:34,883 --> 01:12:37,511
Yeah, I want the dollar.

1169
01:12:37,586 --> 01:12:38,610
Bye.

1170
01:12:38,686 --> 01:12:40,119
It was good meeting you.

1171
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:40,848
I don't know
if I'll see you again.

1172
01:12:40,923 --> 01:12:42,185
We'll do hugs.

1173
01:12:42,257 --> 01:12:44,122
We're doing hugs.

1174
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:46,127
It was nice meeting you.

1175
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:47,127
Bye.

1176
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:48,128
All right, guys.

1177
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:49,892
Have a good night.

1178
01:12:49,965 --> 01:12:52,661
Hey, so you're...

1179
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:53,633
Oh, no, I'm going to...

1180
01:12:53,701 --> 01:12:56,431
Is it...I was going to hang here
for just a couple more minutes.

1181
01:12:56,505 --> 01:12:58,200
That's cool, right?

1182
01:15:46,643 --> 01:15:48,611
Carroll Street.

1183
01:15:48,677 --> 01:15:50,269
Transfer for the F train.

1184
01:15:50,345 --> 01:15:53,837
Smith and 9th Streets
next and last stop...

1185
01:15:53,838 --> 01:15:54,838
