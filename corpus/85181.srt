1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Tommy, hurry up, you're gonna
be late for school again!

2
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,200
Son of a...

3
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,400
TOMMY BOY

4
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,000
Damn!

5
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,000
Nice doggy, nice doggy!

6
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Holy shnikees!

7
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,999
Late again Tommy?

8
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,800
- You're pathetic.
- Shut up, Richard!

9
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,500
Hurry up Tommy, hurry up!

10
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Damn!

11
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,400
Hi. How are you?

12
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:51,100
Oh, man!
No, please, God, no!

13
00:02:51,101 --> 00:02:52,900
Son of a...

14
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,700
Sorry. Excuse me.
Pard me.

15
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,600
Can I Just check this, uh.

16
00:03:42,601 --> 00:03:48,999
D +?
Oh my God! I passed!

17
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,549
I passed! Oh, man i got a D+!

18
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:56,099
I'm gonna graduate!

19
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:00,700
I wish that we'd known each other.
This is a little awkward.

20
00:04:00,701 --> 00:04:02,900
I'm gonna graduate!

21
00:04:02,901 --> 00:04:04,700
D+!

22
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,000
Hey guys, do i look different now that
i'm a college grad?

23
00:04:18,001 --> 00:04:19,800
Not really.

24
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,899
Apparently they give a lot
fewer D+'s than D-'s.

25
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,700
It's not a grade they like to give out,
i'll tell ya that right now.

26
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:29,299
Yeah, you mentioned that.

27
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,400
So, that's it for school, uh?
Now what?

28
00:04:31,401 --> 00:04:32,899
No idea.

29
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:37,000
Well, for now i'll probably go back and
work in my dad's loading dock like always.

30
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:39,199
And after that, figure it out.

31
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,700
I'm gonna miss you man.
You're the best.

32
00:04:41,701 --> 00:04:44,799
Uh-uh, you are the best.

33
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,400
I love all you guys.
Specially you.

34
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,699
I'm gonna make a toast.

35
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,300
To the best bunch of rugby
freaks ever born.

36
00:04:58,301 --> 00:04:58,999
Yes sir.

37
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,699
Maybe we weren't the smartest
guys on campus.

38
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,000
Maybe we spent too much time
puking off balconies.

39
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,800
- But we had fun, huh?
- Yeah!

40
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,400
Now, some of us are leaving,
and that is sad.

41
00:05:14,401 --> 00:05:16,999
But this isn't the end.
No way.

42
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
We're gonna show this world
a thing or two. We're gonna show...

43
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,999
- Richard Hayden?
- Tommy.

44
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,650
So where's my dad? I thought he was
gonna meet me at the airport.

45
00:05:42,651 --> 00:05:45,300
He was at the airport this morning,
but you weren't on the plane.

46
00:05:45,301 --> 00:05:47,599
He said he had a surprise for me.

47
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,199
Maybe. I guess you should have called.

48
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,850
I did call, earlier, when...
using the phone.

49
00:05:52,851 --> 00:05:56,499
- Earlier? When was that?
- Er... later...

50
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,899
When, when... then... I...
huh.., I left a message.

51
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,299
A message?
What number did you call?

52
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:05,999
- 249...5...678...

53
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,300
I can't hear you. You're trailing off.
And did i catch a "niner" in there?

54
00:06:09,301 --> 00:06:11,200
What Were you calling from,
a walkie-talkie?

55
00:06:11,201 --> 00:06:12,899
No, it was cordless.

56
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,500
You know what? Don't.
Not here, not now.

57
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:17,999
Did you hear i finally graduated?

58
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,799
Yeah. And just a shade under
a decade too. All right.

59
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,900
You know, a lot of people
go to college for 7 years.

60
00:06:22,901 --> 00:06:25,000
I know. They're called doctors.

61
00:06:25,001 --> 00:06:27,700
Oh, that has to be you.

62
00:06:30,701 --> 00:06:32,701
Spray that thing for bugs?

63
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,700
Hey, what happened to the tire plant?

64
00:06:57,701 --> 00:06:59,299
They shut it down last month.

65
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,000
Would you mind not eating in the car?
It's kind of a rule.

66
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:04,999
- You still got your GTX car, huh?
- Yes.

67
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,099
And i dropped in a 440 Magnum
with a six-pack.

68
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,899
You hang on to a car this cherry,
kinda' like your suitcase.

69
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:15,700
Kinda' like your suitcase... Hey, what's
new with the old gang from high-school?

70
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:18,700
I don't know Tommy. I didn't really
like the old gang from high-school.

71
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,300
- Hey, the muffler plant's gone too.
- Yes.

72
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:27,050
Come on! Dammit.

73
00:07:27,051 --> 00:07:31,000
That sounds good. Melted
chocolate inside the dash.

74
00:07:31,001 --> 00:07:32,799
That really ups the resale value.

75
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,350
I think you're gonna be ok here.
They have a thin candy shell.

76
00:07:35,351 --> 00:07:37,900
'Surprised you didn't know that.

77
00:07:37,901 --> 00:07:41,100
I think your brain is
a thick candy shell.

78
00:07:41,101 --> 00:07:44,300
Your brain has the shell on it.

79
00:07:44,301 --> 00:07:46,700
- Are you talking?
- Shut up, Richard!

80
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,050
Ron, don't tell me the bank
thinks we need to wait it out.

81
00:08:02,051 --> 00:08:05,600
Any business that tries to wait
it out will be just that, out.

82
00:08:05,601 --> 00:08:08,400
In auto-parts, you're either
growing our you're dying.

83
00:08:08,401 --> 00:08:09,799
There ain't no third direction.

84
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,900
Tom, you're talking about a huge loan.
Maybe instead of borrowing,

85
00:08:12,901 --> 00:08:14,999
you should take on a partner.

86
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,300
This always has and always
will be a family firm.

87
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,299
My grandfather founded it in '21,

88
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,500
my father kept it running
during the depression,

89
00:08:23,501 --> 00:08:25,700
my aunt Ilenne, ran it when
he went away to war

90
00:08:25,701 --> 00:08:27,300
and someday my son will run it.

91
00:08:27,301 --> 00:08:29,800
- Hi dad.
- Tommy!

92
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,100
Am i proud of you.
Mister big time, college grad, huh?

93
00:08:42,101 --> 00:08:43,599
Thanks dad.

94
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,100
- You're looking great kid.
- Thanks Mr. Rittenhauer.

95
00:08:47,101 --> 00:08:48,399
Oh, how you doin' Mr. Reilly?

96
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:53,000
Real good. I had a kidney removed last
April, but i still have the other one.

97
00:08:53,001 --> 00:08:55,399
You remember Mr. Gilmore
from the bank?

98
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,200
- Yeah. Nice to see you again sir.
- How are you?

99
00:08:57,201 --> 00:08:58,999
Listen, why don't you come out
on the floor with us?

100
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,700
Mr. Gilmore needs reminding
of why he does business with us.

101
00:09:01,701 --> 00:09:03,099
Richard, could you huh...

102
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,999
Run these figures by accounting.
No problem.

103
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,500
My fellow nerds and I will retire
to the nerdery with our calculators.

104
00:09:08,501 --> 00:09:11,700
We should have something for you...
by this afternoon.

105
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:17,000
Hard hats, gentlemen. If you get hit in
the head without wearing one of these,

106
00:09:17,001 --> 00:09:19,500
they scoop your brains up with
a goddamned soup ladle.

107
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,800
Hey, look alive!
Low bridge!

108
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,400
Son of a...

109
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,500
- You all right, Tommy?
- Yeah...

110
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:33,199
- What happened?
- Nothing.

111
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,400
- Danny! How's that new son-in-law?
- He's a real pain in the butt.

112
00:09:36,401 --> 00:09:40,500
Hey Tommy, you're back!
Way to go on that D +!

113
00:09:40,501 --> 00:09:42,700
Thanks, Danny.
Looking good man.

114
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,699
- Hey, Tommy!
- Hey man! How you doing?

115
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,500
Hey how are you. Good to see ya,
how you doin'?

116
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,400
- Hey, Sammy!
- Tommy! Welcome home buddy.

117
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,899
Hang in there, Ron.
We're almost there.

118
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,800
Lou, i got some papers i want
you to sign in the office.

119
00:10:04,801 --> 00:10:07,599
- Hey, Tommy!
- What are you doing on the floor?

120
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,600
Yeah, I was going crazy on the loading
docks, so your dad moved me in here.

121
00:10:10,601 --> 00:10:12,599
- Hey, what is this thing?
- It's a buffer.

122
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,400
I take oil filters that need smoothing
and give 'em a quick zap.

123
00:10:15,401 --> 00:10:16,699
Cool!

124
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,200
- Can i try one?
- Help yourself.

125
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,299
Nice distance.

126
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,300
- Tommy! Come on! Let's go!
- Yes, sir. See ya.

127
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:39,100
Here she is, Ron. My dream. This, my
friend, is our new brake pad division.

128
00:10:39,101 --> 00:10:41,799
And the future of "Callahan Auto".

129
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,499
- Quite a sight, Tom.
- This is awesome.

130
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,600
You say these brake pads are gonna
revolutionize the industry?

131
00:10:47,601 --> 00:10:49,699
Composed of high grade
steel and graphite.

132
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,050
They're the goddamned Rolls Royce
of brake pads. That's what they are.

133
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,400
I get tears off my eyes
just thinking about it.

134
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,699
You coming awful fast,
how do you do it?

135
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,800
I need fresh capital for material,
for new work force

136
00:11:06,801 --> 00:11:08,599
before i can turn these machines on.

137
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,600
Look out!
I got cat- like speed and reflexes.

138
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,750
In 23 years, have i ever
said no to you, huh?

139
00:11:15,751 --> 00:11:18,800
Why say "no" when it feels
so good to say "yes"?

140
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:34,000
I was checking the, ah, specs on the
end line, for the rotary girder...

141
00:11:34,001 --> 00:11:37,800
- I'm retarded...
- Okay, Tom. Let's go!

142
00:11:37,801 --> 00:11:39,100
Yes, sir.

143
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,600
Okay, left.

144
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,399
Can i open my eyes now dad?

145
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,000
I never told you you had to close
them in the first place, son.

146
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:51,500
Yeah, go ahead! Open 'em up.

147
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,699
That's my name!

148
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,499
Yeah, and that's your new office
now, college grad. Go on in there!

149
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,400
Awesome!
Hey, there's even a fridge!

150
00:12:01,401 --> 00:12:05,300
This is great... you
can put six-packs of be-

151
00:12:05,301 --> 00:12:08,399
Soda in here. Milk, yoghurt.

152
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,350
You can put candy bars in the freezer.

153
00:12:10,351 --> 00:12:12,299
Anything that you wanna keep cool.

154
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,500
Mr. Callahan, i need your
John Hancock on these reports.

155
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:19,299
John Hancock...
It's Herbie Hancock.

156
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:23,250
- Richard, check out my new office!
- You've a window.

157
00:12:23,251 --> 00:12:27,200
And why shouldn't you?
You've been here 10 minutes.

158
00:12:27,201 --> 00:12:30,000
Now look son, these are
our new catalogues.

159
00:12:30,001 --> 00:12:31,599
Get to know them,
they're important.

160
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,200
Richard, you promise me you're gonna look
after Tommy here 'til he gets his feet wet.

161
00:12:36,201 --> 00:12:38,799
Sure. And thanks for choosing me.

162
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,000
Now don't forget, we're
going home early today.

163
00:12:41,001 --> 00:12:43,200
I got another surprise for you.

164
00:12:43,201 --> 00:12:45,000
Cool! Thanks, dad.

165
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,400
It's called reading. Top to bottom,
left to right.

166
00:12:51,401 --> 00:12:53,399
Group words
together as a sentence.

167
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,300
Take Tylenol for any headaches.
Midol for any cramps.

168
00:12:56,301 --> 00:12:58,100
Shut up!

169
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,399
Can i open my eyes now dad?

170
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,500
For God's sake son, will you quit
covering your damned eyes?

171
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,800
Holy shnikees!

172
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,400
- Is that for me?
- No, son, that's for me.

173
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,499
Dad, she's like a ten.

174
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,800
Hi, honey.
This must be Tommy.

175
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:06,099
- Are you Tommy?
- I'm Tommy.

176
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,300
I'm Beverly,
and you're just adorable.

177
00:14:09,301 --> 00:14:10,999
Nah...

178
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,750
Son, i got an announcement to make.

179
00:14:14,751 --> 00:14:18,500
Tom, i've asked Beverly
to be my wife.

180
00:14:18,501 --> 00:14:21,300
Wow, man!

181
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,000
What did she say?

182
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,400
It's so cool that you're getting married
Saturday. So where did you guys meet?

183
00:14:33,401 --> 00:14:35,199
Here you go, sweetie.

184
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,399
We met at the fat farm
spa resort thing.

185
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,200
Beverly was one of the trainers. In fact
she was the only one of the trainers

186
00:14:42,201 --> 00:14:44,800
i didn't wanna
plant six feet under a lettuce patch.

187
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,699
Wait 'til you hear this! She's got a son.
He worked at the spa too.

188
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,600
I met him. He's a terrific guy.
You're really gonna like him.

189
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:54,500
He's coming here today,
for the wedding.

190
00:14:54,501 --> 00:15:00,000
Tommy, it sounds funny saying this, but
my son is going to be your new brother.

191
00:15:00,001 --> 00:15:05,500
Brother? I'm gonna have a brother?
I've always dreamed about having a brother.

192
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,400
Speak of the devil.

193
00:15:08,401 --> 00:15:10,100
A brother!

194
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,199
- Brother?
- I'm Paul, you must be Tommy.

195
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,200
Brothers don't shake hands.
Brothers gotta hug.

196
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:39,000
I can't believe i have a whole
new family. This is awesome!

197
00:15:39,001 --> 00:15:40,799
Yeah. Great.

198
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,600
No offense, but if i showed a picture of
your mom to some of my buddies at school

199
00:15:44,601 --> 00:15:47,800
she'd definitely be
boner of the month.

200
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,799
I'm honoured.

201
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,300
So is there anything to
do in this town besides eat?

202
00:15:53,301 --> 00:15:57,199
Tons of stuff.
Late night pitch and putt.

203
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,900
We go to the livestock auction
and cruise the 4-H babes.

204
00:15:59,901 --> 00:16:02,599
Throw stuff off the bridge.
What do you feel like doing?

205
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,550
I don't know. Something
a little more dangerous.

206
00:16:05,551 --> 00:16:08,500
Sure. All you can handle bro.

207
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:24,699
Look at 'em there!
Pretty maids all in a row.

208
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:28,800
I want the one on the left.
She's perfect. Which one d'you want?

209
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,399
- Does it make a difference?
- Oh, yeah.

210
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,400
- Wait a second. Is this your first time?
- Yeah, Tommy, it is.

211
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,850
You're gonna remember this
the rest of your life.

212
00:16:45,851 --> 00:16:48,800
Can't believe you've
never been cow tipping before.

213
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:51,300
Get ready to live!

214
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:58,100
She's sleeping. What you do is put
your shoulder into her and you push.

215
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,000
- And?
- They fall over.

216
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,399
And this doesn't strike
you as kinda' dumb?

217
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,400
We're family. We're gonna be doing
lots of dumb stuff together.

218
00:17:10,401 --> 00:17:12,000
Wait 'til Christmas.

219
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,799
You keep your feet
shoulder-width apart.

220
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,000
Stay between the udder
and the hock, it's a...

221
00:17:18,001 --> 00:17:21,700
32 belly option on 2-1-2.
Ready! Hut!

222
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,399
Holy Shnikees!

223
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,400
Hey, get off my property!

224
00:17:31,401 --> 00:17:33,400
Run for it!

225
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,100
- I'll save you brother!
- I'm ok. Get away from me!

226
00:17:42,101 --> 00:17:43,099
Get up!

227
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,600
- Come on!
- I love you.

228
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,099
Hey, get me! My turn!
Over here!

229
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,499
These shoes are Italian.
They're worth more than your life.

230
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,650
Man! Did i get dooshed with mud!

231
00:17:56,651 --> 00:17:59,800
Hey Chucko, that
doesn't smell like mud.

232
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,100
Oh, man, that's cold!

233
00:18:03,101 --> 00:18:05,799
I'm a maniac. Maniac...

234
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:12,000
... on the floor. And i'm dancing
like i never danced before.

235
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,900
Did you eat a lot
of paint chips when you were a kid?

236
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,200
Why?

237
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,500
- Mornin', Richard.
- Hi.

238
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,400
Luke, I am your father.

239
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,500
I've interrupted "happy
time". Look, your father wants

240
00:19:03,501 --> 00:19:05,700
you to check out the
delay problems we're having

241
00:19:05,701 --> 00:19:09,500
at the loading dock. Now, i know you'd
love to just sit there and keep being...

242
00:19:09,501 --> 00:19:12,200
not slim, but we gotta
work a little today, okay.

243
00:19:12,201 --> 00:19:14,800
- That was from Star Wars".
- I know.

244
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,799
R.T. I think i figured out the problem.

245
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,850
This order's going to Columbus.
That's a one day delivery,

246
00:19:27,851 --> 00:19:30,900
but you've got it
marked down for two.

247
00:19:30,901 --> 00:19:35,900
That's because it's going to Columbus,
Georgia, not Columbus, Ohio.

248
00:19:35,901 --> 00:19:40,199
You see these letters by the city?
That's called a state.

249
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,600
- What else you got, Wonder Boy?
- That's pretty much it for now.

250
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:51,000
Tommy, maybe you should go back
to college for another 7 years

251
00:19:51,001 --> 00:19:52,500
and study a globe.

252
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,699
Tommy Callahan?

253
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,000
Michelle Brock. Chaparrall High.
Remember?

254
00:19:59,001 --> 00:20:02,900
Yeah, i remember!
I sat next to you in History.

255
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:06,800
You work here?
It's so bizarre that you work here.

256
00:20:06,801 --> 00:20:09,899
Come on in!
Oh, and forget about R.T.!

257
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,400
He's pissed off 'cause he recently
found out what a loser he is.

258
00:20:12,401 --> 00:20:14,900
A loser he is!

259
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:20,500
Nice. How come you don't put
the files in the file cabinets?

260
00:20:20,501 --> 00:20:22,199
I don't like file cabinets.

261
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,799
- Why not?
- You have to open them.

262
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,700
I've got my own system.
Hasn't failed me yet.

263
00:20:25,701 --> 00:20:27,599
All the shipping
orders go through me,

264
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,900
which means i spend about half of my
pathetically anal life in here.

265
00:20:30,901 --> 00:20:32,899
So if i couldn't do
things my own way,

266
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,900
i'd probably freak out and
blow up the whole town.

267
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:36,699
Cool!

268
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:40,999
Hey, remember your brother, Duane?
Whatever happened to him?

269
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,700
We used to go to "Safeway" all the time
and get caught trying to steal doughnuts.

270
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:48,000
He's a cop. He had to get
a real job when my parents

271
00:20:48,001 --> 00:20:49,900
moved to Cuyahoga Falls.

272
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,199
- Want one?
- I'd better not.

273
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,000
I have what doctors call
a little bit of a weight problem.

274
00:21:01,001 --> 00:21:04,250
I used to grab bear claws
as a kid, two at a time

275
00:21:04,251 --> 00:21:07,500
and i'd get 'em lodged
right in this region here.

276
00:21:07,501 --> 00:21:10,200
- How about some coffee?
- I'd love some.

277
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:21,100
- Man, i bet half the town's here.
- Yeah...

278
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,000
- You look great dad.
- You look good too, Tommy Boy.

279
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,400
Listen, this marriage thing, i know
it's a big step... but you know...

280
00:21:33,401 --> 00:21:35,200
Ever since your mom died...

281
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,700
Something about getting old
and being alone.

282
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,800
You know... it's something...

283
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,000
Dad... It's cool, you know.

284
00:21:56,001 --> 00:21:59,500
I just want you to be happy.

285
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,000
Yeah, i know you do.
And i am, kid!

286
00:22:03,001 --> 00:22:04,700
I am, Tommy boy.

287
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,200
- They're ready for you sir.
- Good. We're ready too.

288
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,700
- How do we look?
- Chubby?

289
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,900
I think that's the champagne talking.

290
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,250
And so these vows are held sacred from

291
00:22:26,251 --> 00:22:28,799
now until eternity.
If there's any person

292
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,100
who finds a reason these
two should not be wed,

293
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:35,100
speak now or forever hold your peace.

294
00:22:35,101 --> 00:22:37,100
You kiddin'?
Go get her, Tom!

295
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:43,500
Now by the power invested in
me by the state of Ohio,

296
00:22:43,501 --> 00:22:47,900
i now pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

297
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,099
Say something for the bride and groom!

298
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,999
Hey dad and Beverly, this is Michelle Brock,
the prettiest gal in Sandusky.

299
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,300
- Michelle, say a little something into the camera!
- A little something into the camera.

300
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,750
Sounds good, Tom, but i'd like to take
a look at your operation before i commit.

301
00:23:25,751 --> 00:23:29,800
Fair enough, Doug. 'Course i can get a
hell of a good look at a t-bone steak

302
00:23:29,801 --> 00:23:31,599
by sticking my head up a bulls ass,

303
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,400
but i'd rather take
a butcher's word for it.

304
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,599
Bull's ass, that's great.

305
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,399
And you guarantee everything you sell?

306
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,100
You know i could guarantee you all day
long, but we both know a guarantee is

307
00:23:42,101 --> 00:23:44,200
only as good as the man who writes it.

308
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,100
Sounds good, Tom.
I'll send the contract next week.

309
00:23:48,101 --> 00:23:49,399
Good man!

310
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,699
You're still the best, Tom.

311
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,500
Eight whisky-sours and i still sell
the son of a bitch. Damn i'm good.

312
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,899
I just wanna tell you you really
look dynamite today, Beverly.

313
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,900
Yeah, Tom, you're a lucky man.
Boy, would I like to get some of that!

314
00:24:01,901 --> 00:24:03,200
Good Lord!

315
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:08,100
Oh no! Listen, Richard, you got
a edit button on that thing?

316
00:24:08,101 --> 00:24:10,850
- It'll cost ya.
- Come here, you little prick!

317
00:24:10,851 --> 00:24:13,600
All right, all right,
hold it a second folks!

318
00:24:13,601 --> 00:24:15,899
Wait a minute...
Yeah, yeah, workin'.

319
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,900
Listen, i wanna thank you
all for coming today

320
00:24:18,901 --> 00:24:21,899
to welcome two new Callahans
to the family.

321
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,050
My beautiful wife, Beverly
and my new son, Paul.

322
00:24:25,051 --> 00:24:28,200
I feel like i'm the luckiest
man in the world today.

323
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,199
Hit it!

324
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,900
And right now i'm gonna need you,
Tommy boy, to get this place going.

325
00:24:35,901 --> 00:24:38,700
- Oh, for me dad?
- Yeah, you Tommy boy.

326
00:24:38,701 --> 00:24:41,800
Dad, i really don't think...
Okay.

327
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,100
First rocker, take it,
Tommy boy!

328
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,000
That's right, Tommy boy!

329
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,100
Shake the rock to me!

330
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,600
That's right, dad!

331
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,199
Dad?

332
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,600
Somebody call 911!

333
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:08,150
There's not much more
we can say, really.

334
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:11,000
We've lost someone
we love, and it hurts.

335
00:26:11,001 --> 00:26:14,350
Even though Tom is gone,

336
00:26:14,351 --> 00:26:17,700
he'll remain in our lives for ever.

337
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:21,050
comforting us, making us laugh...

338
00:26:21,051 --> 00:26:24,400
and marching over us.

339
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,799
My dad gave me this boat.

340
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,299
We'd come out here late at night,
when there's no one else in the lake

341
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,300
and then he'd be over there,
on the shore, and he'd yell:

342
00:27:49,301 --> 00:27:52,300
"Quit playing with your dingie!"

343
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,300
I'm gonna really miss him.

344
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,700
- Your father was a great guy.
- Yeah.

345
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,799
I'm really glad you
brought me out here.

346
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:18,200
Can't believe you wanted to.
Although it's pretty fun.

347
00:28:18,201 --> 00:28:20,299
If we had some wind...

348
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:23,050
I can't believe there's no wind.

349
00:28:23,051 --> 00:28:25,575
You need wind... cause it, uh-

350
00:28:25,576 --> 00:28:28,100
- Helps push the sail.
- Yeah.

351
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,750
So, what are you gonna do now?

352
00:28:33,751 --> 00:28:36,700
I don't know.

353
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:42,200
But, i gotta do something.
I don't know what.

354
00:28:42,201 --> 00:28:46,699
- Man, do i sound like an idiot?
- No.

355
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:51,000
Sorry about this wind. I can't believe
there isn't any wind out here.

356
00:28:51,001 --> 00:28:57,300
- This is ridiculous.
- No, it's great. It's very peaceful.

357
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,100
Hey tub-o! You ain't moving!

358
00:29:02,101 --> 00:29:05,399
Yeah, need a little wind here!

359
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,600
No. You need to drop
a couple 100 pounds, blimp!

360
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,499
Rascals.

361
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,100
I guess that's your theory.

362
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,100
So, we'll see what
happens tomorrow.

363
00:29:19,101 --> 00:29:21,799
Hey, your sail is limp,
like your dick!

364
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,800
Watch your language
in front of the lady, punk!

365
00:29:24,801 --> 00:29:27,599
Geez!
You were saying?

366
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,199
Hey, Gilligan,
did you eat the Skipper?

367
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:36,400
You kids better pray to the god of skinny
punks that this wind doesn't pick up,

368
00:29:36,401 --> 00:29:40,300
cause i'll come over there
and shove an oar up your ass!

369
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:46,900
Eapers creepers, those guys keep
interrupting us. I'm sorry about that.

370
00:29:46,901 --> 00:29:48,899
You were saying about the uh...

371
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:52,500
Hey lady, look out!
There's a fat whale on your boat!

372
00:29:52,501 --> 00:29:54,700
Yeah. Free Willy!

373
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,550
Listen up you little spazoids,
i know where you live and

374
00:29:58,551 --> 00:30:01,699
i've seen where you sleep.
I swear to everything holy

375
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,100
that your mothers will cry when
they see what i've done to you!

376
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,200
I was just kidding.
I've no idea where they live.

377
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,100
That was awesome!

378
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,299
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're in real trouble.

379
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:35,100
Zalinsky Industries has an offer
on the table to buy us out.

380
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:38,500
But as you realize "Callahan"
has been family owned

381
00:30:38,501 --> 00:30:41,900
since Tommy's great grandfather
laid the first brick

382
00:30:41,901 --> 00:30:45,300
And i'll be damned if that's
gonna change on my watch.

383
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:47,299
Frank, if we sell while
our value's still high,

384
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,300
everyone who owns stock in this
company stands to make a lot of money.

385
00:30:50,301 --> 00:30:52,699
That of course includes you,
Mrs. Callahan,

386
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,099
Now that you and Tommy
are the primary shareholders.

387
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:58,300
It seems vulgar to think about
money at a time like this.

388
00:30:58,301 --> 00:31:00,399
I don't wanna hear
the word "sell" again.

389
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,500
But Ron, we do need that loan
to keep us afloat

390
00:31:03,501 --> 00:31:05,099
until we figure things out.

391
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,400
I'm sorry, Frank, we can't do it.
Tom got in way over his head when he

392
00:31:08,401 --> 00:31:09,899
built the new brake pad division.

393
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,099
The bank just can't take any
chance in putting up any more money.

394
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:16,700
Now, let's face it, when big Tom died,
"Callahan Auto" may have died with him.

395
00:31:16,701 --> 00:31:19,600
If this factory goes under,
the whole town goes under.

396
00:31:19,601 --> 00:31:21,900
And that's when the whores come in.

397
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,599
Excuse me, what was that?

398
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:29,200
Men laying their trick-money down.
20 dollars to pay the rent?

399
00:31:29,201 --> 00:31:31,499
Maybe instead i'll spend it
on the whore.

400
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,700
Frank, i really don't think
we have any choice.

401
00:31:33,701 --> 00:31:36,000
Maybe i can help.

402
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,299
I give you everything i've got:
my house, the stock.

403
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:43,900
If i give you that stuff, it's collateral,
then would you give us that loan?

404
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,299
Yes, i suppose so.

405
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:51,400
Wait a second! What are you saying, Tommy?
You just wanna hand over your inheritance?

406
00:31:51,401 --> 00:31:54,099
Right. If it'll help get
the brake pads going.

407
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,900
My dad said the new pads
were the future of "Callahan".

408
00:31:56,901 --> 00:32:00,050
But who's going to sell them?

409
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:03,199
I will.

410
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,199
- I'll go on my dad's sale trip.
- I'll be damned!

411
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:10,300
Whores running around doing their
little behind shake for the men folk.

412
00:32:10,301 --> 00:32:11,499
I kinda like her idea.

413
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:15,400
For Christ's sake, once during
the war i visited a prostitute,

414
00:32:15,401 --> 00:32:17,799
and my life has been
a living hell eversince.

415
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:22,400
Hold on a minute! Do we really wanna put
the future of the company in Tommy's hands?

416
00:32:22,401 --> 00:32:24,699
We're running low
on options here, Ted.

417
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,300
I can hold out Zalinsky
for a couple of weeks.

418
00:32:27,301 --> 00:32:28,699
What have we got to lose?

419
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,499
How about the jobs of 300 people?

420
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,600
No offense, Tommy, but you don't know
the first thing about brake pads.

421
00:32:33,601 --> 00:32:37,700
Hey, i know i'm not probably the
answer you guys are looking for,

422
00:32:37,701 --> 00:32:40,799
but i feel i gotta do something.

423
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:46,200
You're right. I don't know much
about this stuff, but he does.

424
00:32:46,201 --> 00:32:47,399
Oh, no!

425
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,400
That's right. Richard knows more
about brake pads than anyone in here.

426
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:52,999
And since you were my dad's
right-hand man,

427
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,700
i see you have the rest of
the year pretty much wide open.

428
00:32:56,701 --> 00:32:58,599
Time out! Bad idea.

429
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,100
I don't think anyone could help
Baby Huey out there on the road.

430
00:33:01,101 --> 00:33:02,700
You have a better suggestion?

431
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,600
I can actually hear
you're getting fatter.

432
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,500
What did i say about
eating in the car, anyways?

433
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,600
That it's not good cause
it spoils your dinner?

434
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,900
Hey, Tommy, this is not a vacation for me.
And i'm here against my will,

435
00:33:30,901 --> 00:33:33,100
so the least you can do
is pretend to work.

436
00:33:33,101 --> 00:33:34,999
Ok? Now let's review!

437
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,950
Okay, you're right. Review time.
Let's do it up! Feed me!

438
00:33:37,951 --> 00:33:40,900
First, what are the three grades
of Callahan Brake pads?

439
00:33:40,901 --> 00:33:46,199
Personal, commercial and... agricultural.

440
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,300
And what is our carrying charge for
all the merchandise in the warehouse?

441
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,399
- One and a...
- Half per cent!

442
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,700
I knew that!
Why can't i remember it?

443
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,599
Try an association, like, uh:

444
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,500
Let's say the average person
uses 10% of their brain.

445
00:34:01,501 --> 00:34:04,199
How much do you use?
1,5%.

446
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,700
The rest is clogged with
malted hops and bong resin.

447
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,100
I gotta do this!
This's got to be the one!

448
00:34:18,101 --> 00:34:21,200
I gotta do this.
It's gotta be me...

449
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,699
- Are you ready?
- Yeah. Sorry, i'm ready.

450
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:29,700
- Hey, does this suit make me look fat?
- No, your face does.

451
00:34:29,701 --> 00:34:33,000
Okay, let's check you out!
All right.

452
00:34:33,001 --> 00:34:36,299
- That's a clip-on.
- Are you sure?

453
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:40,200
Alright now, it's sales time,
remember we don't take no-

454
00:34:40,201 --> 00:34:41,899
- No shit from anyone.
- No.

455
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:45,100
- We don't take no prisoners.
- We don't take no for an answer.

456
00:34:45,101 --> 00:34:47,600
Oh yeah. We don't take
no for an answer...

457
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,250
- No.
- Okey dokey.

458
00:34:56,251 --> 00:34:57,899
- No.
- Gotcha. Thanks.

459
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,900
Terrific! Thanks for your time.

460
00:35:00,901 --> 00:35:03,800
Let me say... maybe.

461
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,500
Well then, i'd just like to add
that the spectrometer

462
00:35:09,501 --> 00:35:11,499
read-out on the nickel-cadmium
alloy mix

463
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,600
indicates a good, rich
strobe n' fade, decreasing

464
00:35:13,601 --> 00:35:15,700
incidence of wear
to the pressure plate.

465
00:35:15,701 --> 00:35:18,600
- If you could just...
- Whoa, little fella, you're not speaking my language.

466
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,650
What my associate is trying to say,

467
00:35:23,651 --> 00:35:26,400
is that our new brake
pads are really cool.

468
00:35:26,401 --> 00:35:27,899
You're not even gonna believe it.

469
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:32,400
Like, let's say you're driving along
the road, with your family...

470
00:35:32,401 --> 00:35:33,600
And you're driving along...

471
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,700
And then all of a sudden
there's a truck tire

472
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:38,700
in the middle of the road,
and you hit the brakes.

473
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,900
Woah, that was close.

474
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,599
Now let's see what happens when you're
driving with "the other guy's brake pads".

475
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,300
You're driving along,
you're driving along,

476
00:35:48,301 --> 00:35:51,000
and suddenly your kids are
yelling from the back seat.

477
00:35:51,001 --> 00:35:54,200
"I gotta go to the bathroom, daddy!"
"Not now, dammit!"

478
00:35:54,201 --> 00:35:57,900
Truck tire! I can't stop!

479
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,800
There's a cliff!

480
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,400
And your family screaming:
"Oh my God, we're burning alive!"

481
00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:15,300
No, i can't feel my leg!
Here comes the meat-wagon.

482
00:36:15,301 --> 00:36:18,800
And the medic gets out and says:
"Oh, my God!"

483
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:22,300
New guy's in the corner,
puking his guts out.

484
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,200
All because you wanna save a couple of
extra pennies... and to me, it doesn't-

485
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,700
Get out! Now!

486
00:36:32,701 --> 00:36:35,200
Yes, sir.

487
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,000
- Do you validate?
- Now!

488
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,899
She's a quart low.

489
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,650
Oh, yeah? Then guess what,
open it back up and put it in!

490
00:36:58,651 --> 00:37:01,125
That's your penance for your
puppet show back there.

491
00:37:01,126 --> 00:37:03,599
And while you're at it,
fill it up with gas, okay?

492
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:07,200
I'm gonna ask directions to the
next huge embarrassing failure.

493
00:37:07,201 --> 00:37:09,700
You're a huge embarrassing failure.

494
00:37:09,701 --> 00:37:12,200
- What?
- Nuthin'.

495
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,600
Hey chief, could you tell me
how far it is to Davenport?

496
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,899
22 mi.

497
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:28,100
- I can't find it on this map.
- Well, get yourself a new map.

498
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,200
Son of a...

499
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:05,900
Well, it's gotta be on the map,
Davenport, because you say it's 22mi away.

500
00:38:05,901 --> 00:38:10,299
And you're really smart...
Yet it's not on the map.

501
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:13,400
- I'm picking up your sarcasm.
- I'd hope so...

502
00:38:13,401 --> 00:38:15,401
'cause i'm laying it
on you pretty thick.

503
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,199
That's a map of Illinois,
which we're in.

504
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:34,900
On the border of Iowa. Which is
where Davenport is, 22 mi away.

505
00:38:34,901 --> 00:38:38,500
You're in the wrong state.
Get yourself a new map!

506
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:45,700
That wasn't so hard, was it?
How much do i owe your for gas?

507
00:38:45,701 --> 00:38:48,300
- You didn't pump any.
- What?!

508
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,199
Why didn't you pump any gas?

509
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,800
They're all out. They only got diesel.
Better go to the next station!

510
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,000
What'd you do?

511
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:18,999
I'd just like to welcome you all
to our annual Callahan Employee Night.

512
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,700
I know it doesn't quite feel the same without
Big Tom here, but we're still a family.

513
00:39:24,701 --> 00:39:27,400
So let's try and have some fun!

514
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:33,950
Hey, Mr. Rittenhauer! Is it true Tommy's
on the road trying to save this place?

515
00:39:33,951 --> 00:39:38,600
Tommy's out there filling in for his
dad until we get things settled here.

516
00:39:38,601 --> 00:39:41,099
Are you kidding?
We're all screwed!

517
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:44,000
That kid's one apple that
fell way off the tree.

518
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,200
Mommy, i want a popsicle.

519
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,899
That hurt!

520
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,200
You wanna act like a baby,
i'll treat you like one.

521
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,000
Now, if you wanna act
like a big boy...

522
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,599
Bad mommy.

523
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,299
Don't call me that, it's creepy.

524
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,699
Come on, this is working out
better than we planned.

525
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,600
I thought it'd take a year to bleed
him dry in the divorce settlement.

526
00:40:20,601 --> 00:40:22,850
Instead the guy croaks,
you own half the company.

527
00:40:22,851 --> 00:40:25,100
Yeah, it's too bad he didn't
leave me any cash.

528
00:40:25,101 --> 00:40:27,099
- You talked to the banker?
- Yeah.

529
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,800
Unfortunately your stock isn't worth
dick until they sell the place.

530
00:40:29,801 --> 00:40:32,200
That moment is rapidly approaching.

531
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,199
Hi, grandpa.

532
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,599
Mr. Rittenhauer, is Tommy,
you know, doing okay?

533
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:45,000
Yeah, sometimes it takes a little time
for a salesman to find his style.

534
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,000
- You think he's finding one?
- I hope so.

535
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,950
Hold on right there
honey. I'll see you Michelle.

536
00:40:51,951 --> 00:40:54,000
See you.

537
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,400
I'm telling you, Paul... the only
thing keeping us poor is Tommy.

538
00:41:09,401 --> 00:41:13,100
The guy's an idiot.
He won't sell squat.

539
00:41:13,101 --> 00:41:15,600
This is what i think of Callahan.

540
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,800
Tommy saved the factory.
That's a laugh!

541
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,699
I don't see any McKeesport.

542
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:40,250
It's the next town, Tons-of-Fun.
It's gotta be there.

543
00:41:40,251 --> 00:41:43,800
Ok, where's moron?
Moron's here, so McKeesport...

544
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:48,100
Look, Magellan,
we're at this wrinkle here.

545
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,099
You saw it happen. There was
nothing i could do, right?

546
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:05,800
Maybe if you didn't lean over to insult
me you would have seen it coming.

547
00:42:05,801 --> 00:42:07,500
Shut up, Tommy!
It's not my fault.

548
00:42:07,501 --> 00:42:09,699
Poor little furry thing!

549
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,999
I'd never seen one close up before.

550
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,900
What are we gonna do?
We can't just leave it here.

551
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,899
Oh, no! Loading it up took
us over an hour.

552
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,299
Now we only got 20 minutes before
"Brady Automotive" closes.

553
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:32,200
- Yeah, where are we gonna take the deer?
- I don't know. The vet?

554
00:42:32,201 --> 00:42:33,899
You take dead animals to the vet?

555
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:36,800
- Why not? I'd take you to the vet.
- Yeah, i'll take you to the...

556
00:42:36,801 --> 00:42:39,399
- Got that?
- Shut up!

557
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,100
- It's just down the hall sir, last door on the left.
- Thank you.

558
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,299
Hey, what's your hurry?

559
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,499
You know that thing in the back seat?

560
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:49,300
It's not an air refreshener.
It's a dead rotting deer carcass.

561
00:42:49,301 --> 00:42:50,799
And we gotta take care of it quick.

562
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,600
And this is one of our
oldest customers,

563
00:42:52,601 --> 00:42:53,599
we should be in and out.

564
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,050
This sales thing isn't so easy.

565
00:42:56,051 --> 00:42:58,500
You can't just go in and out,
you gotta finesse'm a little bit.

566
00:42:58,501 --> 00:43:00,700
Hey, by finesse do you mean
sputtering sentence fragments

567
00:43:00,701 --> 00:43:02,499
and lighting things on fire?

568
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:05,599
No, but... It's nice to
see you again Mr. Insult.

569
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:09,200
Say, have you seen Richard anywhere?
Cause if you do, can you ask him,

570
00:43:09,201 --> 00:43:13,500
i mean, since he's so good,
if he might wanna try selling?

571
00:43:13,501 --> 00:43:15,200
Oh yeah? Watch and learn.

572
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:19,700
Of course i understand what "no" means.
But if i took no for an answer

573
00:43:19,701 --> 00:43:21,999
i probably would wind up
on a street corner selling

574
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,699
spicy hotdogs and wearing a funny hat,
right? It makes sense, doesn't it?

575
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:28,200
Look, i've been doing
business with Callahan

576
00:43:28,201 --> 00:43:30,700
since i hung up my shingle.
But i don't like you.

577
00:43:30,701 --> 00:43:32,299
Probably never will.

578
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:35,800
You're a smug unhappy little man, and
you treat people like they were idiots.

579
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:43,099
Mr. Brady, you and my dad go way back.

580
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:46,599
Son, i was sorry to hear
about your dad, i was.

581
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,650
But before i decide to keep
my business with your place,

582
00:43:49,651 --> 00:43:52,699
i'd have to come by and have
a look at your new operation.

583
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,700
Hey, i'll tell you what:
you can take a good look

584
00:43:54,701 --> 00:43:56,700
at a butcher's ass by
sticking your head up there

585
00:43:56,701 --> 00:43:58,899
but wouldn't you rather
take his word for it?

586
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:04,199
What? I'm failing to make
the connection here, son.

587
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,050
No, i mean, you can get
a good look at a T-bone

588
00:44:07,051 --> 00:44:09,900
by sticking your head up
a butcher's ass, but then...

589
00:44:09,901 --> 00:44:12,501
No, it's gotta be your bull.

590
00:44:12,502 --> 00:44:16,099
Here's the deal, if i want you--

591
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:18,699
- You have derailed.
- Shut up, Richard!

592
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,749
Boy, i'm really at
a loss for words here.

593
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:22,799
Forget it. I quit.

594
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:29,700
I can't do this anymore man. My head's
about to explode. My whole life sucks.

595
00:44:29,701 --> 00:44:31,900
I don't know what i'm doing.
I don't know where i'm going.

596
00:44:31,901 --> 00:44:34,499
My dad just died.
We just killed Bambi.

597
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:38,100
I'm out here getting my ass kicked,
and every time i drive down the road,

598
00:44:38,101 --> 00:44:42,200
i want to jerk the wheel into
a goddamn bridge embankment!

599
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:51,700
We'll be in touch.

600
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:03,299
That guy might not call us.

601
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,299
I can't believe you called me a psycho.

602
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:07,300
Were you in there just now?
You are a psycho.

603
00:45:07,301 --> 00:45:09,099
Good God! And comb your hair.

604
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:13,200
I wouldn't say you did much better.
I thought you were so cool.

605
00:45:13,201 --> 00:45:17,300
Watch and learn he says. And i
was watching. You know what i saw?

606
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,100
It's alive!

607
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:31,100
I think it tried to bite me!

608
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,599
No way that just happened.

609
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,599
My car is completely destroyed.

610
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:11,500
I swear i've seen a lot of stuff
in my life, but that was awesome!

611
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:17,500
But sorry about your car, man.
It sucks.

612
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,200
We'll return to the "Zalinsky Family Theater"
after these messages.

613
00:46:26,201 --> 00:46:28,500
Will you shut the window, Tommy!
You're letting moths in.

614
00:46:28,501 --> 00:46:30,700
- No, it's hot in here.
- Will you please...

615
00:46:30,701 --> 00:46:31,599
Look, it's him!

616
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,600
America, if you need starters,
spark plugs, ball joints,

617
00:46:34,601 --> 00:46:36,800
gaskets, camshafts,
u-joints or rocker-arms,

618
00:46:36,801 --> 00:46:38,800
anything that can be screwed or
glued to that car or truck of yours?

619
00:46:38,801 --> 00:46:40,100
Come see ol' Ray!

620
00:46:40,101 --> 00:46:43,800
You want a guarantee? I got a
guarantee stamped on every box.

621
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:46,100
He's got really weird hair.

622
00:46:46,101 --> 00:46:50,300
But more important is the guarantee
that i make to the American worker.

623
00:46:50,301 --> 00:46:53,600
I want your truck to help
you get the job done.

624
00:46:53,601 --> 00:46:57,200
I want your cruiser to get out there safely,
so you can clean up the streets.

625
00:46:57,201 --> 00:47:00,400
And i want your kids to be safe
when you take them for a ride.

626
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:03,200
- Thanks, Ray.
- Thank you, son.

627
00:47:03,201 --> 00:47:08,000
The name's Zalinsky. I make car parts
for the American working man,

628
00:47:08,001 --> 00:47:11,000
because that's who i am.
And that's who i care about.

629
00:47:11,001 --> 00:47:14,900
Drive down to Zalinsky.
He's the auto parts king.

630
00:47:14,901 --> 00:47:17,199
He seems like a nice guy.

631
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,900
This is the guy trying to buy the company,
not to mention put you on the street

632
00:47:20,901 --> 00:47:23,700
and all you can say is
"he seems like a nice guy"?

633
00:47:23,701 --> 00:47:25,300
He does.

634
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:33,700
Michelle! I'm glad you called me back.
Yeah, things are going great.

635
00:47:33,701 --> 00:47:36,199
I feel my first sale
coming out real soon.

636
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:40,600
Yeah, he's here. He's just going
over his car insurance forms.

637
00:47:40,601 --> 00:47:42,300
Could we get any more moths in here?

638
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:46,699
What? Oh, Richard's vacuuming.

639
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:51,699
He's vacuuming. I don't know.
I guess he's clean.

640
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:56,100
Can i call you back in a few minutes?
Thanks. I miss you.

641
00:47:56,101 --> 00:47:58,800
Hey! You can't sleep
with the window open.

642
00:47:58,801 --> 00:48:01,499
And let me lay down
some other rules too.

643
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:06,900
- What are you so mad about?
- Are you nuts? Do you even have to ask?

644
00:48:06,901 --> 00:48:10,299
My car is destroyed.
We haven't made one sale.

645
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,350
Which means we only
have to sell about a

646
00:48:12,351 --> 00:48:14,400
half million brake pads
in the next ten days,

647
00:48:14,401 --> 00:48:16,299
or else the factory is going under.

648
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:20,200
And the one guy who should be caring
about this, you, doesn't.

649
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:27,600
You know what, Richard? You don't know
me as good as you think you do.

650
00:48:27,601 --> 00:48:31,400
I care about stuff, i'm getting
better at this sales thing.

651
00:48:31,401 --> 00:48:35,699
I'm not, but i could if you help me.

652
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:38,800
Forget it, i have enough to do without
having to change your diapers.

653
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:50,000
- Richard, is this your coat?
- Don't do it!

654
00:48:50,001 --> 00:48:52,600
Fat guy in little coat.

655
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,599
No.

656
00:48:55,600 --> 00:49:00,100
Fat guy in a little coat.

657
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,450
Take it off.
I'm serious.

658
00:49:06,451 --> 00:49:08,700
Richard, what's happening?

659
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,100
- Good tune man.
- I don't think so.

660
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:35,200
- Yeah, here we go.
- This song sucks.

661
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:43,100
- Talk about lame.
- Totally.

662
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,399
You can change it if you want.

663
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,500
- I don't care, it's up to you.
- I can live with it if you can.

664
00:49:47,501 --> 00:49:48,800
Suit yourself.

665
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,100
Oh, God.

666
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,200
Hey, i was just thinking, when
we stopped for gas this morning

667
00:50:56,201 --> 00:50:59,000
i think it was you who put the oil in.

668
00:50:59,001 --> 00:51:01,900
Hey, if you're gonna say i didn't
put the right kind, then you're wrong.

669
00:51:01,901 --> 00:51:03,899
I used 10W-30.

670
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:06,999
And besides, motor oil would have
nothing to do with this accident.

671
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,400
True. But you can't latch the hood
too well if you don't take the can out

672
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:14,700
you no-selling waste of space!
I swear to God you're worthless.

673
00:51:14,701 --> 00:51:19,100
I'm sorry about your car.
But don't call me worthless.

674
00:51:19,101 --> 00:51:20,800
I'm trying my best.
I'm not my dad.

675
00:51:20,801 --> 00:51:22,499
That's right. You're not your dad.

676
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,300
He could sell a ketchup popsicle
to a woman in white gloves.

677
00:51:25,301 --> 00:51:27,199
- Ketchup popsicle?
- Yeah.

678
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,799
I learned everything i know from him.

679
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,350
I didn't have a father,
and he looked out for me. But you!

680
00:51:31,351 --> 00:51:33,899
He was your real dad and you
just took it for granted.

681
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:37,700
Hey, i'm big Tom's son, he'll fix
everything, so i'm allowed to be a moron.

682
00:51:37,701 --> 00:51:41,900
That's it! Get out of the car!
It's go time, you and me.

683
00:51:41,901 --> 00:51:46,100
Look Mommy, the rhino is
getting too close to the car.

684
00:51:46,101 --> 00:51:49,700
Him too 'fraid to get out.
He just a little guy.

685
00:51:49,701 --> 00:51:51,699
That's it big boy.
I'm gonna wail on you.

686
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:54,300
You're gonna regret volunteering
for this job, Porky.

687
00:51:54,301 --> 00:51:56,499
Hey boys and girls,
it's Papa Smurf!

688
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,199
You know what, you don't want
none of me, think it through.

689
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,400
Come on, give me your best shot, and i'll
give you a free one! Let me have it!

690
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,899
That's it?

691
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:05,800
Come on, you can do better than that,
can't ya Captain Limp Wrist?

692
00:52:05,801 --> 00:52:07,000
Try again.

693
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,900
Hey everybody, is there a
window open? I feel a draft.

694
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:16,400
If i wanted a kiss,
i woulda called your mother.

695
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,600
That was a good one.

696
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:25,300
Prehistoric Forest...

697
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:42,100
Richard, do i have a mark on my face?
It really hurts.

698
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:47,800
No, nothing. I thought i
hit you on the shoulder.

699
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:53,500
My shoulder doesn't hurt very much,
but my face does. Right here.

700
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,900
Not here,
or here so much, but right here.

701
00:52:57,901 --> 00:52:59,600
Nope. Sheep shape.

702
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:04,800
Waitress could i get that shrimp
cocktail i saw on the glass case?

703
00:53:04,801 --> 00:53:09,200
Yeah. And you... What can i get-
Jesus, what happened to your face?

704
00:53:09,201 --> 00:53:13,199
I knew it. See, Richard?
I'll have chicken wings.

705
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,399
Kitchen's closed until dinner.
I just got cold stuff and desserts.

706
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:20,700
Boy, some chicken wings would really
hit the spot. You sure it's closed?

707
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:25,099
Let me check.
Yup, it's closed.

708
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:29,000
Okay. I'll just have
a sugar packet or two.

709
00:53:29,001 --> 00:53:32,400
- Hey, what's your name?
- Helen.

710
00:53:32,401 --> 00:53:35,799
That's nice.
You look like a Helen.

711
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:41,300
Helen, we're both in sales. Let me
tell you why i suck as a salesman.

712
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:43,399
Let's say i go into some guy's office

713
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:46,399
let's say he's even remotely
interested in buying something.

714
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,600
Well, then i get all excited, i'm
like Jo-Jo, the idiot circus-boy,

715
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:53,899
with a pretty new pet.
The pet is my possible sale.

716
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:58,500
Oh, my pretty little pet. I love you!

717
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:03,100
So i stroke it, and i
pet it, and i massage it.

718
00:54:03,101 --> 00:54:08,300
I love it, i love my little
naughty pet. You're naughty.

719
00:54:08,301 --> 00:54:12,300
And then i take my
naughty pet, and i go...

720
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:22,200
I killed it!
I killed my sale!

721
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:24,899
That's when i blow it.

722
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:27,600
That's when people like us have got
to forge head, Helen. Am i right?

723
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,600
God, you're sick. Tell you what,

724
00:54:34,601 --> 00:54:38,200
i'll go turn the friers back on
and throw some wings in for ya.

725
00:54:38,201 --> 00:54:42,500
Thanks, Helen. Tommy like-y.
Tommy want wing-y.

726
00:54:42,501 --> 00:54:46,800
Did that board to the head
knock something loose?

727
00:54:46,801 --> 00:54:48,199
What are you talking about?

728
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,000
That 180 you just
pulled at the waitress.

729
00:54:50,001 --> 00:54:51,399
Why can't you sell like that?

730
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:54,500
I'm just having fun.
If we didn't get the wings, so what?

731
00:54:54,501 --> 00:54:56,899
We still got that meat-lovers'
pizza in the trunk.

732
00:54:56,900 --> 00:55:01,299
You got the wings cause you're relaxed.
You had confidence.

733
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:04,600
And that's what it takes to sell.
Confidence. Your dad had that.

734
00:55:04,601 --> 00:55:07,700
Why do you always have
to de-turd this things?

735
00:55:07,701 --> 00:55:09,499
My dad was smart, i'm not.

736
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:12,099
Very true. But there's
two types of smarts,

737
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,800
book smarts, which waved bye-bye
to you long ago,

738
00:55:14,801 --> 00:55:17,500
and there's street-smarts,
the ability to read people.

739
00:55:17,501 --> 00:55:19,899
And you know how to do that,
just like your dad.

740
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:21,900
He was the best at knowing
what people wanted to hear,

741
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:23,900
and what people needed to hear.

742
00:55:23,901 --> 00:55:25,599
That's what selling is all about.

743
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:29,500
In a way, these people are
buying you, not just brake pads.

744
00:55:29,501 --> 00:55:31,700
Hey everybody, it's Tony Robbins!

745
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:36,299
- Maybe you're right, Richard.
- I think i am.

746
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:40,300
Holy Lord, look at this guy, caught
him right after thanksgiving feast.

747
00:55:40,301 --> 00:55:44,000
- Nice, Richard.
- Now i need a Pooper-Scooper.

748
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:52,999
I like your line.
And i like your prices.

749
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,799
But there's a problem.
There's no guarantee on the box.

750
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:00,500
If they break down, you can call
me at home, even if i'm watching TV.

751
00:56:00,501 --> 00:56:04,099
Callahan has guaranteed
every part sold since 1925.

752
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:07,900
Maybe so, but it's not on the box.
It should always be on the box.

753
00:56:07,901 --> 00:56:11,700
Comforting you, calling out
"I'm good. I'll never let you down."

754
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:13,999
"But if i do, i'm gonna
make all things better."

755
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,650
Our brake pads are made of
a non-corrosive poly-plated...

756
00:56:16,651 --> 00:56:19,299
Son, if you're not talking
about a guarantee, skip it.

757
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:21,300
My customers need to see that little
label, lookin' at 'em right in the eye.

758
00:56:21,301 --> 00:56:25,400
- Hey, you can get a good look at your butcher...
- No.

759
00:56:25,401 --> 00:56:26,299
What?

760
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:28,799
- Remember, chicken wings.
- Chicken wings?

761
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,400
Alright, uh, you wanna talk
about guarantees, then...

762
00:56:30,401 --> 00:56:32,400
Fellas, you just ran out of time.

763
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:37,699
Chicken wings.

764
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:39,899
Let's think about
this for a sec, Ted.

765
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:45,300
Why would someone put a guarantee
on a box? Hmm, very interesting.

766
00:56:45,301 --> 00:56:46,699
Go on! I'm listening.

767
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:48,499
Here's the way i see it, Ted.

768
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:52,200
A guy puts a fancy guarantee on the box 'cause
he wants you to feel all warm and toasty inside.

769
00:56:52,201 --> 00:56:56,100
- Yeah, makes a man feel good.
- Of course it does. Why shouldn't it?

770
00:56:56,101 --> 00:57:00,000
You figure you put that little box
under your pillow at night, the Guarantee Fairy

771
00:57:00,001 --> 00:57:02,800
might come down and leave
a quarter, am i right, Ted?

772
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:05,599
What's your point?

773
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,899
The point is, how do you know
the fairy isn't a crazy glue sniffer?

774
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:12,200
"Building model airplanes" says the
little fairy. Well, we're not buying it.

775
00:57:12,201 --> 00:57:14,599
He sneaks into your house once,
that's all it takes.

776
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,700
Next thing you know there's money missing
off the dresser and your daughter

777
00:57:16,701 --> 00:57:19,450
is knocked up.
I've seen it a hundred times.

778
00:57:19,451 --> 00:57:22,199
But why do they put a
guarantee on the box then?

779
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:25,399
'Cause they know all they sold
you was a guaranteed piece of shit.

780
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:28,900
That's all it is, isn't it? Hey, if
you want me to take a dump in a box

781
00:57:28,901 --> 00:57:31,299
and mark it "guaranteed", i will.
I got spare time.

782
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:34,400
But for now, for your customers' sake,
for your daughter's sake

783
00:57:34,401 --> 00:57:37,500
you might wanna think about
buying a quality product from me.

784
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,650
Okay, i'll buy from you.

785
00:57:41,651 --> 00:57:43,300
- Well I...
- What?!

786
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,500
He's made one deal, Paul.
It's not the end of the world.

787
00:57:49,501 --> 00:57:52,599
What would be good for us?
We wanna sell the factory.

788
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:55,400
They're not gonna sell the factory
as long as Tommy keeps making sales.

789
00:57:55,401 --> 00:57:57,499
Why don't you come to bed?

790
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:01,399
I got it! What does every
factory need? Trucks.

791
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:04,800
They make stuff. They gotta ship it.
It's most simple.

792
00:58:04,801 --> 00:58:08,000
We stop the trucks,
we stop Tommy boy.

793
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,800
Not good.

794
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:17,300
Come on man, let's at least take five
minutes to celebrate our first victory!

795
00:59:17,301 --> 00:59:20,399
Look, we got lucky, don't jinx it.
We only have a week left

796
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:24,100
before the loan's due. I gotta finish figuring
out our trips tonight, so we can jam out early.

797
00:59:24,101 --> 00:59:28,000
Okay, i'll tell you what. You work out that
scientific stuff, i'll go out and get a pizza.

798
00:59:28,001 --> 00:59:31,900
The only thing i need to figure out is
whether to get Chicago style or thin crust.

799
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:34,500
The salesman has left the building.

800
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Chill bud.

801
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,100
Oh, mamasita!

802
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,499
Hi.

803
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:04,899
Tommy, scram! Don't give her
the weight room thing!

804
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:07,900
Do you know where the weight room is?
I'll check it out.

805
01:00:07,901 --> 01:00:09,800
Sorry.

806
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:15,300
Oh, daddy likes! You get wet
honey, you deserve a swim...

807
01:00:15,301 --> 01:00:17,800
Now take off that itchy robe.

808
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:33,300
Nobody's around.
It's naughty time.

809
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:42,600
Oh, for the love of God, i've been patient.
Please, don't stop!

810
01:00:42,601 --> 01:00:44,700
You've been on the-
Oh, those are real!

811
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:51,200
No one's looking.
Speaking of "no one's looking"...

812
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:58,200
Bad girl.
Ah, thank you...

813
01:00:58,201 --> 01:00:59,400
I'm back.

814
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:08,899
- Richard, what were you doing?
- Going over some documents.

815
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:12,900
- Where are they? Geez, i don't see them.
- They're in my briefcase.

816
01:01:12,901 --> 01:01:15,199
- I thought you were getting pizza.
- They were closed.

817
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:19,300
How could you be reading documents
when they're in your briefcase?

818
01:01:19,301 --> 01:01:21,599
That's a mystery.

819
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:27,699
- Were you watching "Spank-tro-Vision"?
- Ok then, let's hit it!

820
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:31,700
Maybe you were watching a movie with
that funny comedian, oh, what's his name?

821
01:01:31,701 --> 01:01:33,699
Buddy Wackett?

822
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:35,499
All right then,
let's get some shut eye!

823
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:38,750
- Hey, that's a pretty girl down there.
- Good for her!

824
01:01:38,751 --> 01:01:42,000
Geez, i wonder if she goes out
with one of the "Yankees".

825
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,000
Couldn't tell ya.

826
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:55,900
Big day tomorrow.
I hope we can keep this momentum going.

827
01:01:55,901 --> 01:01:57,700
Yup, that'd be good.

828
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:08,500
Richard? Who's your favorite
little rascal? Alfalfa or is it Spanky?

829
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,300
Sinner!

830
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:28,299
Yes, i'll buy.

831
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:29,800
Yes, i like what i hear.

832
01:02:29,801 --> 01:02:30,999
Yes, sounds good.

833
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,200
By the way, did you ever
eat paint chips as a kid?

834
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:42,300
Son of a...

835
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:55,000
A thousand units to Oshkosh?
Tommy, that's fabulous!

836
01:02:55,001 --> 01:02:57,200
Your dad never sold a
thousand in Oshkosh.

837
01:02:57,201 --> 01:02:59,000
uh uh, since i've been here.

838
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:51,100
Lord, i never had to tinkle
so bad in all my life.

839
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:58,599
Richard! You're a riot!

840
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:01,699
Stop the car! Son of a...

841
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:04,500
What the hell's gotten
into you? My thing got

842
01:04:04,501 --> 01:04:07,300
stuck in the zipper, i
got piss all over my pants.

843
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:31,200
Ok, thanks. Bye, i owe you.

844
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,600
Oh, there you are. While i was waiting
i thought i'd make a couple calls.

845
01:04:36,601 --> 01:04:38,600
Okay, mom, i'll call you
later then, bye bye.

846
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:42,300
What do you want?

847
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:47,500
I just wanted to tell you that Tommy's
been talking a lot about you recently

848
01:04:47,501 --> 01:04:49,500
and well, thought you
might wanna know that.

849
01:04:49,501 --> 01:04:50,899
God, he's so sweet.

850
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:53,900
You've no idea how much it means
having you and your mom as family.

851
01:04:53,901 --> 01:04:56,399
He says the sweetest things about her.

852
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:00,599
Everything he does is sweet.
So, when does sweetie get back?

853
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:03,800
This Friday. Which is great, because
we're backed up on orders as it is.

854
01:05:03,801 --> 01:05:06,899
He's turned into this...
selling machine.

855
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:09,200
Well, between that and the sweetness,
i'd say hang on to it.

856
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,600
I gotta go.

857
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:24,800
Yes, sir. I can have that for you tomorrow.
Well, that'd be great. Thank you sir.

858
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:42,800
- Housekeeping.
- No, thank you. Sleeping.

859
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:47,500
- Housekeeping.
- Could you come back here in an hour?

860
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:53,800
- Housekeeping. You want towel?
- No towels, need sleepy.

861
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:57,750
Housekeeping. You
want mint for pillow?

862
01:05:57,751 --> 01:06:01,000
Please, go away! Let me
sleep, for the love of God!

863
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:05,200
Housekeeping. You want me jerk you off?

864
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:10,600
What kind of hotel is this.
what the hell are- Oh, it's you.

865
01:06:10,601 --> 01:06:12,199
Good morning, sunshine.

866
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:15,600
Hey, guess what, i just called "Auto Tech"
and they decided to make an order.

867
01:06:15,601 --> 01:06:18,700
So according to my calculations,
that puts us over the mark.

868
01:06:18,701 --> 01:06:21,999
- We did it?
- We did.

869
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,400
Oh, Richard, i'm so happy!
Hold me!

870
01:06:25,401 --> 01:06:28,800
Don't run away from your feelings!

871
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:56,950
Something went haywire down
at shipping and receiving.

872
01:07:56,951 --> 01:07:59,700
Your shipments got
screwed up in the computer,

873
01:07:59,701 --> 01:08:02,800
the wrong parts went to the wrong cities.
Now all hell's broken lose.

874
01:08:02,801 --> 01:08:04,399
I don't believe this.

875
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,900
Ok, so we call everyone
and explain what happened.

876
01:08:06,901 --> 01:08:09,000
Half the orders have
already been cancelled.

877
01:08:09,001 --> 01:08:10,599
What?!

878
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:13,099
They think it's an indication
of how things work around here.

879
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:16,300
The real problem is that we won't be
able to make the payment to the bank.

880
01:08:16,301 --> 01:08:18,300
It's like a bad "Twilight Zone".

881
01:08:18,301 --> 01:08:20,299
I think i'm growing a tumor.

882
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:22,799
Look, we talk to the bank.
Maybe they'll give us a break.

883
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:25,200
We've been doing business
with them for 23 years.

884
01:08:25,201 --> 01:08:27,600
Tommy, it's all over.

885
01:08:27,601 --> 01:08:31,400
You made a valiant effort, but
we're gonna have to sell to Zalinsky.

886
01:08:31,401 --> 01:08:34,199
I'm flying to Chicago
to sign over the company.

887
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:37,400
- What's gonna happen to the factory?
- He's gonna shut it down.

888
01:08:37,401 --> 01:08:39,850
Zalinsky doesn't care
about our workers.

889
01:08:39,851 --> 01:08:42,300
He wants the Callahan name, that's all.

890
01:08:42,301 --> 01:08:44,199
Did anyone see "Scanners"?

891
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:48,200
Bottom line is, by 6pm tomorrow
we'll all be unemployed.

892
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:02,100
Don't say anything, ok! I know i've
ruined your entire life, and you hate me,

893
01:09:02,101 --> 01:09:04,000
so let me pack my things
and go crawling through

894
01:09:04,001 --> 01:09:06,300
a dark hole for a few years.

895
01:09:06,301 --> 01:09:07,400
Hi.

896
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:14,600
- So, do you hate me?
- I just don't get it.

897
01:09:14,601 --> 01:09:17,499
I guaranteed overnight delivery.

898
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:20,800
- We faxed to our shipping addresses, didn't we?
- Yes.

899
01:09:20,801 --> 01:09:24,100
And they were right when i put
them into my computer. I swear.

900
01:09:24,101 --> 01:09:26,950
And how could-
Oh, man! This was so big!

901
01:09:26,951 --> 01:09:29,800
I know it was big,
but it wasn't my fault.

902
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,500
Why can't you put your files in the
file cabinet like everybody else, uh?

903
01:09:35,501 --> 01:09:39,199
I mean, maybe if you weren't such
a rebel, you could've avoided...

904
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:42,400
Don't worry because i've quit. So you
won't have to put up with anything anymore.

905
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:46,600
Michelle, wait!
Come on, please!

906
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:56,999
Thanks. Have a good flight.
May i help you?

907
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,199
Hi, i called about a ticket
to Cuyahoga Falls, the name's Brock.

908
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:02,900
Right. That flight goes through Columbus.
Let me just call that up for you.

909
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:11,800
Excuse me.

910
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:22,600
Hello, is detective Duane Brock
on duty today?

911
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:28,099
This town doesn't even know
what's about to hit it.

912
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:32,700
Fish in a barrel, my man.
Town's the fish, people are the barrel.

913
01:10:32,701 --> 01:10:34,400
Fish in a barrel...

914
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:41,900
What's wrong with you, Richard?
You can't drink in a car.

915
01:10:41,901 --> 01:10:43,499
Don't you know we could
get busted for that?

916
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:48,100
I'm sorry. I need not know that.
Right now we got a bigger problem.

917
01:10:48,101 --> 01:10:50,100
- That is?
- Beer's coming back up.

918
01:10:50,101 --> 01:10:51,600
Oh, Lord!

919
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,100
Here we go!

920
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:58,699
Cops!

921
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:01,099
Dammit, Richard.
The whole car smells like beer.

922
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:04,800
They're never gonna believe
i wasn't drinking. Hold on!

923
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:08,100
- What are you doing?
- I got an idea.

924
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:11,900
What the hell?

925
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:15,000
When i stop the car,
run out screaming.

926
01:11:15,001 --> 01:11:16,000
No problem.

927
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:22,400
Little trick my dad taught me.

928
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:33,499
Bees! Bees! Bees in the car!
Bees everywhere!

929
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:37,200
God, they're huge!
They're ripping my flesh!

930
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,299
Son, roll around!
Do you hear me?

931
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:44,400
- Roll around on the ground!
- Forget that, i'm starting to swell up!

932
01:11:44,401 --> 01:11:47,500
Save yourself, Tommy!
Don't be the hero!

933
01:11:47,501 --> 01:11:50,600
- Frank, i'm allergic to bees.
- Me too.

934
01:11:50,601 --> 01:11:52,799
They're huge and they sting crazy!

935
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,600
We'll come back
later to check on you.

936
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:56,699
Save yourselves!

937
01:11:56,700 --> 01:11:58,900
Your firearms are useless against them!

938
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:05,699
Holy shnikees, it worked!

939
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:12,600
I just barfed in an anthill.
Cool! Wow, i think they're pissed.

940
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:17,999
Yeah. That's the answer.

941
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,700
Doesn't look like the answer.
I don't remember eating that.

942
01:12:21,701 --> 01:12:25,400
No! Zalinsky. We go to Chicago,
tell him we're not for sale.

943
01:12:25,401 --> 01:12:28,199
He seems like a good guy on TV.
He'll understand.

944
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:33,500
You're dreaming. You can't stop him.
You lost your shares to the bank, remember?

945
01:12:33,501 --> 01:12:36,700
What the hell? In less than 24hs
i'll lose the factory anyway.

946
01:12:36,701 --> 01:12:38,900
So why not give it a shot?

947
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:42,800
- Chicago?
- Chicago.

948
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:55,500
- You can't park here!
- Keep it!

949
01:12:55,501 --> 01:12:56,999
Where are you going?

950
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,799
Leave me a message and
i'll get back to you. Thanks.

951
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:05,200
Hi, Michelle. This is Tommy.
Listen, i'm sorry about what i said.

952
01:13:05,201 --> 01:13:10,600
I was being an idiot. I wanna
apologize cause, i didn't mean it.

953
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:15,300
Anyway, me and Richard are going
to Chicago, to straighten things out.

954
01:13:15,301 --> 01:13:17,900
The next flight to Chicago
boards in five minutes but

955
01:13:17,901 --> 01:13:20,199
i'm sorry, it's completely sold out.

956
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:23,899
I can put you on another one
at 3 o' clock this afternoon.

957
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:28,100
Lady, we really need to get to Chicago.
It's an emergency. Is there anything you can do?

958
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:32,800
I can put you in to
Salt Lake City, by 16.00...

959
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:37,700
I don't have time to go thru another city.
I need a direct flight to Chicago.

960
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:43,000
Oh, i can reserve you a flight
coming back from Chicago at 17.55...

961
01:13:43,001 --> 01:13:43,899
Does that help?

962
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:46,100
Hi. I'm Earth.
Have we met?

963
01:13:46,101 --> 01:13:47,700
I don't think so.

964
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:51,100
So, i'll talk to you later. Okay, bye.

965
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:55,300
We're screwed. No tickets
to Chicago. Not even stand- by.

966
01:13:55,301 --> 01:13:57,200
There's gotta be something we can do.

967
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:03,800
Wait a minute! You got any money?
Cause i got a plan!

968
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:13,400
We're gonna get busted,
let's get out of here!

969
01:14:13,401 --> 01:14:14,399
Too late.

970
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:15,999
Hey, guess who's here!

971
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,200
What are we serving tonight,
chicken or... chicken?

972
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:23,200
What a nice surprise! They said we
were gonna be short-handed this leg.

973
01:14:23,201 --> 01:14:26,000
You two take coach. Oh, and could
you handle the announcements?

974
01:14:26,001 --> 01:14:27,699
Okey dokey. No problemo.

975
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:29,500
They're gonna know we're bogus.

976
01:14:29,501 --> 01:14:31,299
Relax! You get on the horn!

977
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,500
I throw some peanuts at 'em.
We'll be in Chicago before you know it.

978
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:41,350
Ok, folks, the guy in
front of you is Tommy.

979
01:14:41,351 --> 01:14:43,900
He'll be taking you through
my little spiel here.

980
01:14:43,901 --> 01:14:47,800
Tommy is a Scorpio, he likes biking,
and he's never been laid.

981
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:53,150
Exits! Ok, there's one back here,

982
01:14:53,151 --> 01:14:55,700
and there's probably one
over by the wing, somewhere,

983
01:14:55,701 --> 01:14:58,999
usually.
And what about seat belts?

984
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,199
To fasten, take the little end
and stick it in the big end.

985
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:04,950
You know what, if you guys
don't know how to use a seat belt,

986
01:15:04,951 --> 01:15:07,700
just ring the call button and Tommy will
come back there and hit you on the head

987
01:15:07,701 --> 01:15:10,500
with a tack hammer
cause you are a retard.

988
01:15:10,501 --> 01:15:13,300
Ok, and life preservers.
These we may need.

989
01:15:13,301 --> 01:15:14,800
Although what are the odds

990
01:15:14,801 --> 01:15:16,299
of us actually hitting a lake?

991
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:18,499
My money says if anything,
it's gonna be a mountain.

992
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:22,000
To inflate, put it around your
neck and yank down on the tab.

993
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:28,600
Son of a!
I can't breathe!

994
01:15:28,601 --> 01:15:30,100
Chocking!

995
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:39,200
He's a big dumb animal,
isn't he folks?

996
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:43,900
Folks, we're making our final
approach into Chicago.

997
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,400
Ma'am, are you still alive?

998
01:15:48,401 --> 01:15:51,800
Ma'am there's a half hour time limit.

999
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,900
Ok, now, we're running out of time,
so you can't go see Zalinsky like that.

1000
01:16:11,901 --> 01:16:13,400
Now go change!

1001
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:19,400
Go!

1002
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:15,700
Fasten your seat belt.

1003
01:17:31,300 --> 01:17:33,800
I'm okay. I'm fine, i'm fine now.

1004
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:49,799
- What are you doing?
- I'm nervous so i'm sweating.

1005
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:53,400
You're gonna smell like a cab driver.
Not to say that that's bad.

1006
01:17:53,401 --> 01:17:55,600
I wanna be fresh for the meeting.

1007
01:17:55,601 --> 01:17:57,700
Well, you look good. Are you ready?

1008
01:17:57,701 --> 01:17:59,800
Ready or not, this is crunch time.

1009
01:17:59,801 --> 01:18:01,900
525... That's it!

1010
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,499
Son of a... That's gonna leave a mark.

1011
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:13,599
- Whoa, look at this place!
- Welcome to the Pros.

1012
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:18,900
Oh my God, it's him! There he is,
my friend. The King himself.

1013
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:24,100
Let's do it! It's go time.

1014
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:31,299
Where did he go?

1015
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:33,400
I don't know. You check the elevators,
i'll check the bank.

1016
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,000
Where is he? where is he?

1017
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:49,100
Listen up! This'll only take a second!

1018
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:04,300
- Wow, what's going on down here?
- Walk slow!

1019
01:19:04,301 --> 01:19:06,899
- Okay. Why?
- Nothing.

1020
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:10,200
- Am i consorting with a known felon?
- Shut up, Richard!

1021
01:19:10,201 --> 01:19:12,500
Hey mom! It's the guy
who robbed the bank!

1022
01:19:12,501 --> 01:19:14,299
I didn't rob any bank.

1023
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:18,300
Oh, yeah, right. Like there was
other real fat guy with a tiny head.

1024
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:21,000
I got a tiny head?

1025
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:27,100
Zalinsky.

1026
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,400
Say something!

1027
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:39,900
Mr. Zalinsky? I'm Tommy Callahan.
Big Tom Callahan's son.

1028
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:43,700
Sorry to hear about your dad.
He was a good man.

1029
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:48,900
Went a little heavy on the
pine tree perfume there, kid.

1030
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:51,999
Sir, it's a taxi cab air-freshener.

1031
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,700
Great, you've pinpointed it.
Step two is washing it off.

1032
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:58,300
Sir, what exactly happened here?

1033
01:19:58,301 --> 01:20:00,199
He came out of the shadows behind me

1034
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:03,700
and after he hit me many many
times in the head, with a hammer

1035
01:20:03,701 --> 01:20:05,899
i had to give him my gun,
you know, i've got kids.

1036
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:10,100
So as more details emerge on
this attempted bank robbery,

1037
01:20:10,101 --> 01:20:11,799
Action 8 will be there.

1038
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:14,300
But the "Callahan" factory's
been in my family for 70 years,

1039
01:20:14,301 --> 01:20:16,800
you can't just shut it down.

1040
01:20:16,801 --> 01:20:19,200
Son, you gotta look at it
from my point of view.

1041
01:20:19,201 --> 01:20:21,599
Callahan's a premium name.
That's what i'm buying.

1042
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:24,900
I can make the parts in one of my
factories, put 'em in a Callahan box

1043
01:20:24,901 --> 01:20:26,099
and sell 'em in my stores.

1044
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:29,899
At a premium price. Why keep your factory
going when all i want is the goddamned box?

1045
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:32,550
I'll tell you why. Cause
there's a town involved here.

1046
01:20:32,551 --> 01:20:35,200
Callahan factory is the
only thing keeping it alive.

1047
01:20:35,201 --> 01:20:37,100
Look, believe it or not,
i'm providing a service.

1048
01:20:37,101 --> 01:20:39,000
I'm thinning the corporate herd.

1049
01:20:39,001 --> 01:20:41,299
You've seen "Daktari"?
The weaker animals always go.

1050
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:44,000
So the kids cry when you tie an old
tiger to a tree and shoot him.

1051
01:20:44,001 --> 01:20:46,499
But that's life!
America's in a state of renewal.

1052
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:49,400
We've gotta have the strength to
tie a few factories to a tree

1053
01:20:49,401 --> 01:20:50,599
and bash 'em with a shovel.

1054
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:52,999
Meanwhile, if i can grab
your share of the market,

1055
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,850
put a little coin in the
pocket, by being the asshole?

1056
01:20:54,851 --> 01:20:56,700
Well, what the hell,
you know what i mean?

1057
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:00,000
Boy, you sure are different
in your TV commercials.

1058
01:21:00,001 --> 01:21:02,499
What the American public
doesn't know

1059
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:05,100
is what makes them
the American public, alright?

1060
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:10,699
God, i love that!

1061
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:13,900
Hell, folks believe me when i tell them: we're
not just building automotive components here

1062
01:21:13,901 --> 01:21:16,100
we're adding horsepower
to the American industry.

1063
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:25,900
You say a word to anyone and i
will kill you. Do you understand me?

1064
01:21:25,901 --> 01:21:27,500
It looks real.

1065
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:33,399
Yeah, television's been
good to me, son.

1066
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:38,100
I make car parts for the American
working man, because that's what i am

1067
01:21:38,101 --> 01:21:39,800
and that's who i care about.

1068
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:44,899
The truth is i make car parts
for the American working man

1069
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:47,399
because i'm a hell of a salesman,
and he doesn't know any better.

1070
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:50,400
Well, son, since you're no longer the
shareholder, this is where i leave you.

1071
01:21:50,401 --> 01:21:51,699
Don't feel bad.

1072
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:53,950
This chain of events was set in
motion a long long time ago.

1073
01:21:53,951 --> 01:21:56,200
You and your bald headed friend,
you did what you could,

1074
01:21:56,201 --> 01:21:57,199
that's commendable.

1075
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:59,000
Marty, have security
see these boys out!

1076
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:01,300
Mrs. Callahan.

1077
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:07,400
What's my family doing in there?

1078
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:19,799
I thought they were on my side.

1079
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:22,099
They had a lot to gain
if the factory was sold.

1080
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:24,650
Boy, did i screw up.

1081
01:22:24,651 --> 01:22:27,200
My so-called family deserted me.

1082
01:22:27,201 --> 01:22:29,650
Michelle's mad at me.
I lost the factory.

1083
01:22:29,651 --> 01:22:32,100
The town's going under
and i'm out of a job.

1084
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:37,400
Could have done without that.
Geez, i'm an idiot!

1085
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:41,850
Boy, i sure let my dad down.

1086
01:22:41,851 --> 01:22:43,800
You tried as hard as you could.

1087
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:48,200
When we first started out i thought you'd just walk
through this like you walked through everything else.

1088
01:22:48,201 --> 01:22:51,300
But you didn't. So your dad
would've been proud o'you.

1089
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,299
And you got a friend out of it.

1090
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:57,500
Now, i know it doesn't matter
cause you have so many, but uh...

1091
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:00,400
... i don't.

1092
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:04,200
Thanks man.

1093
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:07,900
Tommy.

1094
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:11,099
Michelle!

1095
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:13,200
- Don't tell her about my hair!
- Let it go!

1096
01:23:13,201 --> 01:23:14,999
God, i was worried i wouldn't find you.

1097
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,200
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- I got your message.

1098
01:23:17,201 --> 01:23:19,899
Okay, i was at the airport.
I was going home.

1099
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:22,900
And i saw your step-brother and your
step- mother, and he was kissing her.

1100
01:23:22,901 --> 01:23:24,700
- So?
- With his tongue.

1101
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:29,099
- Doing his mommy?
- She's not his mom. They're married.

1102
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:32,200
They were lying to your dad the whole time.
And my brother got these police reports.

1103
01:23:32,201 --> 01:23:33,099
See?

1104
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:34,099
They lied to my dad?

1105
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:35,700
They're con artists.
They suckered him.

1106
01:23:35,701 --> 01:23:37,300
They lied to my dad.

1107
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:50,900
Richard, i'm gonna need your watch.
I've got a plan.

1108
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:06,600
Folks, Mr. Zalinsky gave us specific
instructions to bar you from the building.

1109
01:24:06,601 --> 01:24:09,500
Sorry boys.
Hopefully we'll just be in and out.

1110
01:24:09,501 --> 01:24:10,599
My God, he's wired!

1111
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:13,300
And uh, no cops.
Wouldn't want things to get messy.

1112
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:20,799
- That was fun.
- Now what?

1113
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:23,600
Well, it's 6 o'clock,
time for the news.

1114
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:27,800
Excuse me!
Oh God.

1115
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:33,900
Done this before?

1116
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:35,900
Thank you, Marty.

1117
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:44,850
My, your hands move quickly!

1118
01:24:44,851 --> 01:24:47,500
Only when i see something
i want, Mrs. Callahan.

1119
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:51,400
Just doesn't seem right.

1120
01:24:51,401 --> 01:24:53,299
Hi! Got a second?

1121
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:56,100
- What the hell's going on?
- Oh, my God, we're gonna die!

1122
01:24:56,101 --> 01:24:57,299
Tommy, what are you doing?

1123
01:24:57,300 --> 01:24:59,200
Hi, Ted. Hi, Frank.
Excuse me, Marty.

1124
01:24:59,201 --> 01:25:00,599
Okay, we're live.

1125
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:03,700
We now switch live to our reporter
who's at the scene with the bomber.

1126
01:25:03,701 --> 01:25:05,400
This is Nicole Taylor,
live from Chicago.

1127
01:25:05,401 --> 01:25:07,000
Hey, look! It's Tommy!

1128
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:11,200
Nicole, i've got something to say.
Please, may i?

1129
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:14,900
Hi. This is Tommy Callahan
here with Mr. Ray Zalinsky,

1130
01:25:14,901 --> 01:25:16,199
American auto-parts king.

1131
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:19,100
Honey, look at this
human-bomb on the news!

1132
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:23,400
Oh yeah, i buy brake pads off him.
I thought we were watching cartoons.

1133
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:27,999
Mr. Zalinsky, for years you've
been putting ads on TV.

1134
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:33,900
And they always end up with you saying:
"I make car parts for..." How does that go?

1135
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:40,300
I make car parts for the American
working man, because that's what i am

1136
01:25:40,301 --> 01:25:41,799
and that's who i care about.

1137
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:45,700
That's why i'm here, Ray.
You see, back in Sandusky, Ohio,

1138
01:25:45,701 --> 01:25:48,400
there are 300 American
workers at "Callahan Auto".

1139
01:25:48,401 --> 01:25:50,199
We make the best parts money can buy.

1140
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:53,200
And right now those workers are
in danger of losing their jobs.

1141
01:25:53,201 --> 01:25:55,800
They're praying that somebody's
gonna step up and help 'em.

1142
01:25:55,801 --> 01:25:57,950
Is that why you've strapped
a bomb to your chest?

1143
01:25:57,951 --> 01:26:00,100
Oh, this isn't a bomb.
These are road flares.

1144
01:26:00,101 --> 01:26:01,699
Road flares?

1145
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:04,000
Did you live under power lines
as a kid or something?

1146
01:26:04,001 --> 01:26:05,499
Why?

1147
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:07,600
Do you guys want this
or "American Gladiators"?

1148
01:26:07,601 --> 01:26:09,499
"Gladiators".

1149
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:12,300
So, do you think "Zalinsky Industries"
can help these folks?

1150
01:26:12,301 --> 01:26:14,600
I'll be happy to look into it.

1151
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:19,900
I'll tell you what, i can get a good look at
a T-bone by sticking my head up a bull's ass,

1152
01:26:19,901 --> 01:26:22,000
but i'd rather take
the butcher's word for it.

1153
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:27,100
Am i just severely wasted
or does Tommy look bloated?

1154
01:26:27,101 --> 01:26:30,500
No, it's TV, man.
Camera adds a couple... 100 pounds.

1155
01:26:31,700 --> 01:26:35,300
Ray, we're not looking for a handout here.
I'm offering you a great deal.

1156
01:26:35,301 --> 01:26:38,700
This is an order for half-a-million
"Callahan" brake pads,

1157
01:26:38,701 --> 01:26:40,200
to be sold in your stores.

1158
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:44,700
Made by the American working man,
for the American working man.

1159
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:53,200
Absolutely. It'd be my great pleasure.
What have i got to lose?

1160
01:26:53,201 --> 01:26:54,999
A great American product, right?

1161
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:58,000
I don't believe it. Tommy just
sold half a million brake pads.

1162
01:26:58,001 --> 01:27:02,500
Tommy just sold a
half million brake pads!

1163
01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:11,900
What difference does it make? The company's
gonna be mine in ten minutes anyway. Right?

1164
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:16,599
Mr. Zalinsky, thank you.

1165
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:18,999
Thank you Tommy boy.
And thank you.

1166
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,200
And remember you can pick up these
great brake pads from "Callahan Auto"

1167
01:27:22,201 --> 01:27:26,000
all my "Zalinsky Auto Parts"
outlets all over North America!

1168
01:27:26,001 --> 01:27:27,399
Bravo, Tommy!

1169
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:31,400
For the moment it looks like a tragedy
has been eluded and a town has been saved.

1170
01:27:31,401 --> 01:27:34,200
For Action News, i'm Nicole Taylor,
reporting live.

1171
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:37,599
Okay, we're out of here!

1172
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:40,300
Wait a minute, fat boy!
You lost your shares to the bank.

1173
01:27:40,301 --> 01:27:42,199
You don't even have
a right to be here.

1174
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:44,550
Gee, funny you should bring that up.

1175
01:27:44,551 --> 01:27:46,900
'Cause i'm not sure that you
have the right to be here.

1176
01:27:46,901 --> 01:27:50,800
What have we got here?
Oh my God, it's a police report!

1177
01:27:50,801 --> 01:27:52,899
- What's all this about?
- Let's see!

1178
01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:56,000
Paul Barrish, married
May 1993 to Beverly Barrish,

1179
01:27:56,001 --> 01:27:58,600
a.k.a. Beverly Burns.
Richard, how could Beverly

1180
01:27:58,601 --> 01:28:01,200
be married to Paul
and my dad at the same time?

1181
01:28:01,201 --> 01:28:03,100
- Interesting.
- Yes. Provocative.

1182
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:07,400
Well, i think it means that your
marriage to my dad was never legal.

1183
01:28:07,401 --> 01:28:09,799
Which also means that Beverly's
shares still belong to Tommy.

1184
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:12,700
- Isn't that right, Mr. Rittenhauer?
- Yes. I believe that's right.

1185
01:28:12,701 --> 01:28:14,400
- Mr. Railly?
- I'd say that's right.

1186
01:28:14,401 --> 01:28:15,800
- Mr. Gilmore?
- Oh, absolutely.

1187
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:21,600
And let me guess, you're not going to be
selling me the company now, are you Tommy boy?

1188
01:28:21,601 --> 01:28:23,299
No sir.

1189
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:25,600
Ray, i have no idea what
they're talking about.

1190
01:28:25,601 --> 01:28:28,700
That's it! You're not gonna take this.

1191
01:28:28,701 --> 01:28:30,499
It's not over yet, Lee Harvey.

1192
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:34,500
Let's see. Warrants outstanding!
New Mexico: mail fraud.

1193
01:28:34,501 --> 01:28:36,199
Colorado: wire fraud.

1194
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:39,700
And coming soon to Ohio:
computer fraud.

1195
01:28:43,700 --> 01:28:45,099
Get him!

1196
01:28:45,100 --> 01:28:47,000
Don't let him leave the complex, Marty!

1197
01:28:51,300 --> 01:28:53,350
Hey, you forgot your wife!

1198
01:28:53,351 --> 01:28:55,400
Screw you!
Screw all of you!

1199
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:59,400
Crash Test in Progress.

1200
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:02,299
Not good.

1201
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:03,600
Hit the brakes!

1202
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:19,450
That will ruin his weekend.

1203
01:29:19,451 --> 01:29:21,399
Well kid, you threw one by me.

1204
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:24,000
Savour the flavour, cause it
sure as hell won't happen again.

1205
01:29:24,001 --> 01:29:26,700
- In the meantime, good luck to you.
- Thank you sir.

1206
01:29:26,701 --> 01:29:29,399
Marty, cut a check to Callahan
Auto for those brake pads!

1207
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:32,900
And you, with all this excitement around
here, i kinda' got a little hungry.

1208
01:29:32,901 --> 01:29:35,400
Wanna step over to my club
and have something to eat?

1209
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:42,199
- Thank you. I'd like that.
- Good.

1210
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:43,999
Marty, find out where the
police will be taking him!

1211
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,500
send over a bottle of bubbly
with a bucket of ice and a card.

1212
01:29:46,501 --> 01:29:48,399
Have it say:
"Tough break, get drunk on me...

1213
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:51,950
use the bucket to ice down
your marbles, yours Z."

1214
01:29:51,951 --> 01:29:55,500
Well, Mr. Callahan, looks like
we're back in business.

1215
01:29:55,501 --> 01:29:56,899
Yes sir, Mr. Rittenhauer.

1216
01:29:56,900 --> 01:29:59,500
- That's great, Tommy!
- Thanks.

1217
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:02,500
Way to go, Tommy Callahan!

1218
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:12,600
- That was pathetic.
- Shut up, Richard!

1219
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:17,699
It's a very proud day for me.

1220
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:22,400
I want to introduce you to the
new president of "Callahan Auto",

1221
01:30:22,401 --> 01:30:24,600
Tom Callahan Junior.

1222
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:33,300
Tommy, will you say something!

1223
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:42,200
Ever since i was a kid, you people
have been like a family to me.

1224
01:30:44,100 --> 01:30:46,799
Louis, we built our
first fort together.

1225
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:50,600
And Danny, remember when we used
to burn ants with a magnifying glass?

1226
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:56,800
R.T., i lost my virginity to your
daughter, for crying out loud!

1227
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:00,700
Rob, you were there.

1228
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:06,500
Anyway, i just want you to know that
as long as i'm around, i'm gonna

1229
01:31:06,501 --> 01:31:08,599
bust my butt and make sure that

1230
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:12,200
every last one of you always has
a job, right here at "Callahan".

1231
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:43,500
Dad, got a little problem here.

1232
01:31:43,501 --> 01:31:46,600
I've been stuck here for
an hour with no wind again.

1233
01:31:46,601 --> 01:31:48,200
I'm supposed to be
at Michelles' for dinner.

1234
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:52,400
So if you could give me a
little help, i'd appreciate it.

1235
01:31:52,401 --> 01:31:54,400
If not, don't worry about it.

1236
01:31:57,700 --> 01:31:59,600
I'm trying to do everything
i think you'd be doing,

1237
01:31:59,601 --> 01:32:02,099
and so far it's going pretty good.

1238
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:05,700
I just wanna tell you that...
i still love you and

1239
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,200
i sure miss you a lot.

1240
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:28,400
Hey, thanks dad!

1241
01:32:29,100 --> 01:32:32,300
Son of a...!
That's gonna leave a mark!

1242
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:39,600
The End.
