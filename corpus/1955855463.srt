00:02:01,578 --> 00:02:03,539
Is this thing on?
Are we on?

3
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,499
Alright, alright!

4
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:09,501
Who's ready to par-tay?

5
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:17,175
Grab your honey pot closer
and get ready to give him

6
00:02:17,177 --> 00:02:20,929
a big old New Year's
Eve smooch.

7
00:02:20,931 --> 00:02:26,185
Here we go now, let's
all join in, on my mark!

8
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:28,603
Ten, nine

9
00:02:28,605 --> 00:02:32,024
eight, seven, six

10
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:35,235
five, four, three,

11
00:02:35,237 --> 00:02:37,572
two, one!

12
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,531
Happy New Year!

13
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:17,070
There you are.

14
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:18,823
You missed the countdown.

15
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,033
I heard it.

16
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:36,214
You left me hanging
in there.

17
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,341
I don't know how you stand
workin' with these people

18
00:03:39,343 --> 00:03:40,679
So are you gonna pay
the mortgage?

19
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,938
Happy New Year, Jeff.

20
00:03:52,356 --> 00:03:53,358
Come here.

21
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:05,912
This is our year, Linz.

22
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,540
We're gonna
make it happen.

23
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:13,211
That was our resolution
last year.

24
00:04:13,752 --> 00:04:14,712
Trust me.

25
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:17,924
This is the one.

26
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,391
- The cops will be out.
- I got it.

27
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,310
Wait, don't we need
to pick up your sister?

28
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,273
When I dropped her off,
she said she'd get a ride.

29
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:38,442
I bet she will.

30
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,166
I didn't wanna tell you
before the party

31
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:55,877
but I caught her going
through our closet earlier.

32
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,838
She left most of her
clothes in New York.

33
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:02,593
She was weird about it.

34
00:05:03,427 --> 00:05:05,719
That's just how she is.

35
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:09,264
Did you think
about the offer?

36
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:10,225
Yeah.

37
00:05:10,976 --> 00:05:12,267
And?

38
00:05:12,269 --> 00:05:14,103
I'll be done by April.

39
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,562
It's been eight months.

40
00:05:15,564 --> 00:05:17,692
I'm sick of living
in a construction zone.

41
00:05:18,692 --> 00:05:20,819
I'm on top of it, Linz.

42
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,128
What are you doing?

43
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:43,133
- Nothing.
- Stop.

44
00:05:44,843 --> 00:05:47,469
What happened to that girl
I fell in love with?

45
00:05:47,471 --> 00:05:48,931
The one who knew
how to live a little.

46
00:05:50,057 --> 00:05:51,307
Remember her?

47
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,268
Jeff!

48
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:16,039
Oh, my God.

49
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,251
What did you do?

50
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:33,015
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Can you hear me, brother?

51
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:35,644
Can you hear me? Hey.

52
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,399
Call 9-1-1.

53
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,319
Will you grab your phone?

54
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:48,447
You're gonna be alright,
alright?

55
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,365
We got, we got people
coming for you.

56
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,118
We're gonna...
just hang in there, man.

57
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,413
There's no reception.

58
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,127
Okay. Okay.

59
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,586
Grab his legs.

60
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:03,546
We gotta take him
ourselves.

61
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,927
Okay, okay, I got him.

62
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,310
Open the door.

63
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:18,855
Okay.

64
00:07:27,863 --> 00:07:29,447
Use this.

65
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:43,543
Hey, hey. It's okay.

66
00:07:43,545 --> 00:07:45,462
Oh, Jesus Christ,
he's seizing!

67
00:07:45,464 --> 00:07:46,589
- What do I do?
- Talk to him!

68
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:49,591
Okay. Hey, hey.
Hey, man.

69
00:07:49,593 --> 00:07:51,635
Don't go towards
the light. You got...

70
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:52,928
You got stuff to live for.

71
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:57,308
Lots of stuff, right?

72
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,269
Hey?

73
00:07:59,603 --> 00:08:04,149
Hey, hey, hey! Hey.
Hey, man?

74
00:08:04,858 --> 00:08:06,193
Can you hear me, man?

75
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,446
Buddy?

76
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,951
He stopped breathing.

77
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,622
- Are you sure?
- I don't fucking know!

78
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,001
Check his pulse.

79
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,055
Nothing.

80
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,605
He's gone.

81
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,902
Okay. Um...

82
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:50,989
How much
did you have to drink?

83
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:53,700
I... I wasn't counting.

84
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,410
We could say
you were driving.

85
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:58,872
I had
three glasses of wine.

86
00:09:04,668 --> 00:09:08,713
Left. Go left.
Go back to the house.

87
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,589
- The hospital's in the other direction!
- Just do it.

88
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,718
- Jeff, we can't...
- We can't stay here!

89
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:19,766
We're gonna take him in,
I promise. We just...

90
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:22,852
We need some place where... w...
where we can think about this, okay?

91
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:23,980
Figure things out.

92
00:10:10,025 --> 00:10:11,735
There's nothing
that we could have done.

93
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:19,244
Two hours.
That's all we need.

94
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,661
- For what?
- Sober up.

95
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,914
Then we'll, we'll drop
him off at the ER

96
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,708
- and pretend like it just happened.
- Whoa, whoa, no, no, no.

97
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,420
- I don't think I can...
- I'll... I'll do the talking.

98
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,921
- Two hours?
- Yeah, that's it.

99
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:35,882
- Then we'll drop him off.
- Okay.

100
00:10:35,884 --> 00:10:37,551
Why don't you,

101
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,639
why don't you change out
of that dress, yeah?

102
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:42,850
Okay.

103
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:59,908
Lindsey, come here.

104
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:11,502
It's probably sitting
in the middle of the road.

105
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,171
- We have to call the police...
- I, I have to go back.

106
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,297
No, no, Jeff,
please don't leave me...

107
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:16,340
I'll be back
in ten minutes.

108
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,592
I'll be back
in ten minutes.

109
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:22,347
You'll be fine.
Close the door behind me.

110
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:23,641
Wait, your shirt!

111
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,143
Hand me the hoodie.

112
00:14:19,274 --> 00:14:21,110
That felt good, thanks.

113
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:26,825
So are we going inside
or what?

114
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,326
And you were doing
so well.

115
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,496
A couple
good pick-up lines

116
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:34,914
a ride on the open road

117
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,752
not desperate,
but not aloof.

118
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,671
So what do you say?

119
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:43,839
A guy I knew used to say that
people are either wolves

120
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,590
or they're wolves
in sheep's clothing.

121
00:14:45,592 --> 00:14:46,760
So which are you?

122
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,307
Happy New Year's.

123
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,685
Happy New Year.

124
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:33,265
Lindsey?

125
00:15:35,143 --> 00:16:02,627
Jeff?

126
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:44,086
Let me go!

127
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,387
My sister's calling
the police right now

128
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,140
my brother-in-law
is getting his gun.

129
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,564
I'm warning you.
This is your last chance.

130
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,305
What the fuck was that?

131
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:39,099
It came from the garage.
I thought it was you.

132
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:53,738
Hannah?
Hannah, whoa! Whoa!

133
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,530
- Let me go, let me go!
- Hannah, Hannah! Stop.

134
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:56,949
- Get away from me! Get off of me!
- It's us. It's me.

135
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:58,241
- Hannah, it's us.
- Get off of me!

136
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:01,120
- Hannah, Hannah, it's us.
- Get away from me!

137
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:03,288
It's me! Hannah, it's me.

138
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,957
Hannah,
we're not gonna hurt you.

139
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,503
Shut up. Shut up.

140
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,634
- Don't go in there, Jeff, don't...
- Shh.

141
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:36,613
Oh, my God, careful.

142
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,283
What did I do?

143
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,536
What did I do?

144
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,162
Hannah, I gotta
get your shoes off, okay?

145
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,163
They're gonna believe me...

146
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:47,374
Sweetie, we're not
calling the police.

147
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,502
Why not?

148
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:51,006
Jeff hit him.

149
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,131
What?

150
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:55,173
It was an accident.

151
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,844
We were trying to help,
okay?

152
00:18:57,846 --> 00:19:00,263
I know, sweetheart.

153
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:02,597
I'm gonna get you
in the shower, okay?

154
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:06,228
Come on, Hannah.
Come on. I got you.

155
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:26,372
What's the deal?

156
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:37,382
She took two Ambien.

157
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:38,802
When I went back...

158
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,305
...there was a police car
on the road.

159
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:45,099
- Near where we hit him.
- I'm calling Bob Graham.

160
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:47,267
A lawyer's more likely to
turn us in than help us.

161
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,436
This isn't "Goodfellas,"
Jeff.

162
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:49,355
If you make that call

163
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:55,360
what do you think
is gonna happen to me?

164
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:56,738
Or your sister?

165
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,452
Look.

166
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,372
You do
what you have to do

167
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:08,623
but I'm gonna go in there

168
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,374
and I'm gonna find out
who this guy is

169
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,044
before we do
something stupid.

170
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,822
Oh, God, please don't be
so rough with him.

171
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,449
Here we go.

172
00:20:52,085 --> 00:21:00,341
Wait.

173
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:10,308
What?

174
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,730
That's... that's
our address.

175
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:17,315
He was on his way here.

176
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:33,333
Is there anything
you've done?

177
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:36,755
Any reason
you could think of...

178
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:39,756
...that would make someone
come after you?

179
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:41,548
Because if there is,
now would be...

180
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,426
- How can you even ask me that?
- You work at a bank!

181
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:45,178
- I'm a loan officer!
- So there's money!

182
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,554
You should have been
watching the road!

183
00:21:46,556 --> 00:21:48,722
Forgive me for trying to spice
things up a little bit.

184
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,057
Maybe if you weren't
always at work

185
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:51,517
letting Crisco
walk all over you.

186
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:54,519
My job is the only thing
keeping us in this house.

187
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,355
- How do you think that makes me feel?
- You don't seem to mind.

188
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:57,356
Yeah, well
you don't seem to mind

189
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:59,109
sitting on your ass
all day.

190
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:07,283
If the cops
found the license plate

191
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:08,745
they could be here
any minute.

192
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:13,875
Hey.

193
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:25,258
We're gonna make it
through this.

194
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,221
Okay?

195
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:29,848
But I need you
to trust me.

196
00:22:32,102 --> 00:22:34,646
- I can't. I can't.
- Yes, you can, yes, you can.

197
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:42,028
If the cops come, we're gonna
tell them that we hit a deer.

198
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,663
We have to do something
about this mess, though.

199
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:35,830
Back there.
We'll deal with it later.

200
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:38,418
Him. We'll deal
with him later.

201
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:07,987
- You know what
this reminds me of?

202
00:24:07,989 --> 00:24:09,031
- What?

203
00:24:10,325 --> 00:24:15,077
That shit-hole apartment
we had after college.

204
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:16,497
Cleaning it after
we moved in.

205
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:19,957
Those brushes
my mom gave us.

206
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,709
Trying not to gag
on the bleach.

207
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,756
- God, it was so damn hot...
- Shut up, Jeff.

208
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:26,672
Yeah.

209
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,401
What time is it?

210
00:25:28,153 --> 00:25:32,904
Uh, almost 8:00, I think.

211
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:35,201
I could use a little
coffee, if you don't mind.

212
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,163
Sure.

213
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,076
Good morning, officers.

214
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:21,578
Happy New Year, ma'am. Sorry
to bother you so early.

215
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,664
Oh, I'm an early riser.

216
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:27,376
I'm Officer Varone.
This is Officer Campbell.

217
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:29,170
Um, you're
Lindsey Pittman?

218
00:26:29,172 --> 00:26:30,921
- Your husband, Jeff Pittman?
- That's right.

219
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:34,257
I wondered who bought the old
place after Miss Dainer passed.

220
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,387
It's a real fixer upper,
but we're getting there.

221
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:40,139
You out late last night,
Mrs. Pittman?

222
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:42,060
Not especially.
We had a work event.

223
00:26:43,853 --> 00:26:46,019
Anything unusual happened
on the drive home?

224
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,854
No, not that
I can think of.

225
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:50,357
Did you or your husband have
anything to drink, ma'am?

226
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:53,819
- No, we don't drink and drive.
- Any car trouble?

227
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:55,072
Why would there be
car trouble?

228
00:26:58,201 --> 00:26:59,700
- Oh, the doe!
- Pardon?

229
00:26:59,702 --> 00:27:01,913
Th... the deer.
We hit a deer.

230
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:08,000
Oh, thank you.

231
00:27:08,002 --> 00:27:09,962
It must have fallen off
during the accident.

232
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,131
Was it okay?

233
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:17,009
Yeah, well, no, the... the,
um, windshield's broken

234
00:27:17,011 --> 00:27:20,013
and the bumper has, you
know, some dents in it.

235
00:27:20,015 --> 00:27:23,391
I meant the deer. There was
some blood in the road.

236
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:25,727
Oh, poor little thing.

237
00:27:25,729 --> 00:27:29,564
Uh, she twitched a couple
times and then ran off.

238
00:27:29,566 --> 00:27:30,692
Can we see?

239
00:27:33,778 --> 00:27:36,069
Well, she ran off,
like I said.

240
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,530
So there's no body here,
officer.

241
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:39,949
He meant the car.

242
00:27:39,951 --> 00:27:41,870
Mrs. Pittman,
We'd like to see it.

243
00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:44,536
Is there a problem?

244
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:45,955
No, we don't.

245
00:27:45,957 --> 00:27:49,792
Just want to have a look
at your vehicle.

246
00:27:49,794 --> 00:27:51,710
Hey, Linz, we're gonna
need some more bleach

247
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:53,130
to cover up
the rest of this...

248
00:27:55,884 --> 00:27:59,052
Um, good morning,
officers.

249
00:27:59,054 --> 00:28:00,469
- Morning.
- Morning.

250
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:01,970
These gentlemen
want to see the damage

251
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:03,014
from the deer we hit.

252
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:04,140
They found this.

253
00:28:04,142 --> 00:28:07,354
Oh, yeah, the deer.

254
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:11,898
You know, what they say,
"You don't really hit a deer

255
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,899
the deer hits you."

256
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:14,361
Is that what they say?

257
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:21,409
It was a big sucker.
Must have been about a...

258
00:28:22,911 --> 00:28:24,496
...four or five-pointer.

259
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:28,288
Wife said it was a doe.

260
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,540
Buck, fawn, doe.

261
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,212
Lindsey knows as much about
deer as I do about nail polish.

262
00:28:43,765 --> 00:28:46,142
Oh, we're donating
some clothes to charity.

263
00:28:48,228 --> 00:28:50,563
Is that so?
Good for you.

264
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:58,611
It is the season.

265
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:05,577
Can I offer you
some coffee?

266
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:09,874
No, thank you, ma'am.
Caffeine keeps me up.

267
00:29:13,545 --> 00:29:15,797
How fast were you traveling
when you hit the animal?

268
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:19,009
About 35 miles per hour.

269
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:21,927
That's a 45 zone.

270
00:29:30,228 --> 00:29:32,812
Can I ask
what this is all about?

271
00:29:32,814 --> 00:29:34,439
Well, we got a lot
of calls last night.

272
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:35,605
More than usual.

273
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,859
Noise complaints,
people seeing things.

274
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:40,611
Even found a broken
down car on Route 4

275
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:42,404
about a mile from here.

276
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:44,699
Not far from
where you hit the deer.

277
00:29:44,701 --> 00:29:46,700
Alternator was busted.

278
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:48,702
No registration.
Stolen plates and...

279
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:50,497
Like I said.
Strange night.

280
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:55,125
We heard some fireworks
at around 1:00.

281
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:56,960
We just assumed it was
some neighborhood kids.

282
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:58,921
Yeah, it happens
every year.

283
00:29:58,923 --> 00:30:01,009
Well, you've got a problem, Mr.
Pittman.

284
00:30:04,346 --> 00:30:05,635
What's that?

285
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:06,888
We see you driving around
with this

286
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:07,974
we're gonna
have to write you up.

287
00:30:10,977 --> 00:30:12,893
Of course.

288
00:30:12,895 --> 00:30:14,978
Yeah,
I'll get it fixed today.

289
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,231
It's a holiday.

290
00:30:17,692 --> 00:30:20,153
Yeah.
Tomorrow then.

291
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:25,948
Well, thank you for stopping by.
Have a Happy New Year.

292
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,535
Lindsey, do you have
any more conditioner?

293
00:30:28,787 --> 00:30:31,371
It's in the cabinet
next to the sink.

294
00:30:31,373 --> 00:30:32,622
Were you in the car
as well, ma'am?

295
00:30:32,624 --> 00:30:34,373
The car?
No, I was in the garage.

296
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:35,374
- That's where it happened.
- My sister...

297
00:30:35,376 --> 00:30:36,377
Let her answer.

298
00:30:37,796 --> 00:30:39,338
What exactly happened
in the garage?

299
00:30:46,096 --> 00:30:48,429
I'm... I'm sorry,
I just woke up.

300
00:30:48,431 --> 00:30:50,765
I'm a little confused.
What's going on?

301
00:30:54,854 --> 00:30:57,104
Ten-four twenty-two
responding.

302
00:30:57,106 --> 00:30:58,480
It's alright, ma'am.
Go back to sleep.

303
00:30:58,482 --> 00:30:59,690
She's going through
a break up.

304
00:30:59,692 --> 00:31:02,026
I think she had too much
to drink last night.

305
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:04,194
- And one more thing, Mrs. Pittman.
- Mm?

306
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:07,949
Tell your husband to open the garage.
Those fumes are toxic.

307
00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:09,993
I will.
Thank you, officer.

308
00:31:19,671 --> 00:31:21,338
Okay, they're gone.

309
00:31:25,844 --> 00:31:29,053
- I didn't say anything.
- You said enough.

310
00:31:29,055 --> 00:31:31,930
- I'm trying to protect us and you're screwing it up.
- Jeff...

311
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:33,266
How was I
supposed to know?

312
00:31:33,268 --> 00:31:34,433
You're the one
who brought him here.

313
00:31:34,435 --> 00:31:35,727
You pasted his brains
on the wall!

314
00:31:35,729 --> 00:31:37,144
Alright,
she's been through enough.

315
00:31:37,146 --> 00:31:39,021
I thought you called them.
Lindsey, please tell him.

316
00:31:39,023 --> 00:31:40,856
- I should turn you in. They'd probably thank me.
- Stop!

317
00:31:40,858 --> 00:31:42,482
I'm so sorry.
This is all my fault.

318
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:43,735
- No, it's not.
- Oh, come on.

319
00:31:43,737 --> 00:31:45,113
I didn't know
they'd come after me.

320
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:48,238
What did you say?

321
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,283
- I didn't mean to.
- I knew it.

322
00:31:50,285 --> 00:31:52,202
- You have to believe me.
- I'll handle this.

323
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:56,248
Who's after you?

324
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:01,794
For the first three months
we dated

325
00:32:01,796 --> 00:32:04,546
I thought he owned
a juice shop.

326
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:08,176
Some organic
vegan bullshit.

327
00:32:08,178 --> 00:32:09,469
The man in the garage?

328
00:32:09,471 --> 00:32:10,635
That's who
you ran away from?

329
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:11,970
No, I've never
seen him before.

330
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:13,892
- Then who is he?
- I don't know.

331
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:19,562
Richard, my boyfriend

332
00:32:19,564 --> 00:32:22,648
his real business
was stocks.

333
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:24,150
They took money
from old people

334
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:25,817
and never actually
invested it anywhere.

335
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:29,072
They just kept it and
sent out fake statements

336
00:32:29,074 --> 00:32:30,198
like, Bernie Madoff.

337
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,865
Un-fucking-believable.

338
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:33,116
Like you're
a model citizen.

339
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:34,744
Why would Richard
come after you?

340
00:32:34,746 --> 00:32:36,120
- He wouldn't.
- He's a criminal.

341
00:32:36,122 --> 00:32:37,332
He wouldn't.

342
00:32:39,334 --> 00:32:41,124
He's dead.

343
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:42,626
His partner killed him.

344
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:44,713
You told me you left
because he hurt you.

345
00:32:48,843 --> 00:32:50,303
I was just scared
you wouldn't let me stay.

346
00:32:52,513 --> 00:32:55,555
I don't know why they
sent that man after me.

347
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:56,849
What happened?

348
00:32:56,851 --> 00:32:59,686
Richard was nervous
about a handoff.

349
00:32:59,688 --> 00:33:01,688
I came home
one afternoon

350
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:05,024
and the whole apartment
had been ransacked.

351
00:33:05,026 --> 00:33:08,986
There was blood
everywhere.

352
00:33:08,988 --> 00:33:10,654
He told me that if
something happened to him

353
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,988
I should go
somewhere safe.

354
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,701
So I grabbed the bag
and I came here.

355
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:16,326
What bag?

356
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,427
What's this?

357
00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:34,139
An Indian
good luck charm.

358
00:33:36,141 --> 00:33:38,181
Richard was into
stuff like that.

359
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:40,267
He gave me this.

360
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:42,814
Says it kept him centered,
whatever that means.

361
00:33:52,574 --> 00:33:56,494
It's a claim slip
from Crown Hill Lodge.

362
00:33:58,496 --> 00:34:01,831
- Did you know about this?
- No, I swear.

363
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:03,415
Ronnie and Joan had
their anniversary there.

364
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:05,625
It's a bed and breakfast,
way out in the boonies.

365
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:07,378
- I'll go grab the keys.
- Let me go with you.

366
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,088
- Not a chance.
- I'm sorry.

367
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:12,719
Fine. What do you want me to tell
the cops if they show up again?

368
00:34:21,186 --> 00:34:23,146
Or would you
rather handle that?

369
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:33,237
I meant to thank you

370
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:39,619
for the phone
and the boots.

371
00:34:39,621 --> 00:34:42,956
It's been a long time since I had
a Christmas with a tree and all.

372
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:49,422
You know we have
something in common.

373
00:34:50,673 --> 00:34:51,840
I doubt that.

374
00:34:54,344 --> 00:34:56,762
We both know what it's like
to live in Lindsey's shadow.

375
00:34:59,974 --> 00:35:02,349
We have an arctic blast
rolling in later tonight

376
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:04,269
dropping down
to the mid-teens and...

377
00:36:00,326 --> 00:36:03,536
Good morning!
I guess it's afternoon.

378
00:36:03,538 --> 00:36:07,414
You must be, uh,
Lindsey Pittman?

379
00:36:07,416 --> 00:36:08,833
Can I help you?

380
00:36:08,835 --> 00:36:11,545
Yes, I am Detective Smith.

381
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:13,880
Is your husband home
by any chance?

382
00:36:13,882 --> 00:36:15,342
Uh, he had to run out.

383
00:36:16,175 --> 00:36:17,134
Oh.

384
00:36:19,179 --> 00:36:20,260
Do you mind if I come in?

385
00:36:20,262 --> 00:36:23,305
I, I got a couple
questions I gotta ask you.

386
00:36:23,307 --> 00:36:25,557
I talked to your friends this morning.
I... I told them everything.

387
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:31,104
Oh, it shouldn't take
long at all, I promise.

388
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:33,025
Okay, what would you
like to know?

389
00:36:34,568 --> 00:36:36,818
Okay, to be honest

390
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,613
I was kinda hoping for a cup
of coffee while we talk.

391
00:36:39,615 --> 00:36:41,240
It's been a long night,
you know.

392
00:36:41,242 --> 00:36:42,369
New Year's Eve
and all.

393
00:36:59,344 --> 00:37:01,469
Should I say anything or should I
just slide it across the counter?

394
00:37:01,471 --> 00:37:02,970
Let me have it, Jeff.

395
00:37:02,972 --> 00:37:05,139
You don't think
I can handle it?

396
00:37:05,141 --> 00:37:08,392
I know how to talk
to these people.

397
00:37:08,394 --> 00:37:10,605
This is my fault.
Let me make it right.

398
00:37:15,068 --> 00:37:17,193
We can tell her
it was you.

399
00:37:17,195 --> 00:37:19,112
I'll even embellish
the story.

400
00:37:19,114 --> 00:37:20,490
You'll be the big hero.

401
00:37:28,498 --> 00:37:31,416
Shit.

402
00:37:31,418 --> 00:37:32,794
It is your fault.

403
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,088
Don't screw it up.

404
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,842
I'll be back before
you can count to three.

405
00:37:50,353 --> 00:37:53,354
So don't you have more
important things to do?

406
00:37:53,356 --> 00:37:56,273
Yeah, it's just
paperwork really.

407
00:37:56,275 --> 00:37:57,441
Bean-counters
want to make sure

408
00:37:57,443 --> 00:37:59,028
we follow up
on every lead.

409
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:02,157
Lead? We hit a deer.

410
00:38:03,324 --> 00:38:05,074
I meant incident report.

411
00:38:05,076 --> 00:38:07,369
Gotta make sure the foot
soldiers didn't miss anything.

412
00:38:09,998 --> 00:38:12,789
So you said
your husband is out?

413
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,251
Uh, he's running
an errand.

414
00:38:15,795 --> 00:38:19,048
New Year's Day,
must be pretty urgent.

415
00:38:21,217 --> 00:38:22,385
Odds and ends.

416
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:30,643
Uh, do you mind?

417
00:38:32,353 --> 00:38:33,687
No, no, have at it.

418
00:38:44,865 --> 00:38:47,450
Now, about the deer.

419
00:38:47,452 --> 00:38:49,409
Oh, well, like we told
them this morning

420
00:38:49,411 --> 00:38:51,829
it was a... a four
or five-point buck.

421
00:38:51,831 --> 00:38:53,664
I guess it knocked
the license plate off.

422
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:55,999
Right.

423
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:58,461
Dulls the blades, right?

424
00:38:58,463 --> 00:38:59,756
You should tell my sister.

425
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,759
I had the same problem
with my ex.

426
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:07,929
Lindsey... I'm sorry.

427
00:39:07,931 --> 00:39:09,429
Do you mind
if I call you Lindsey?

428
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:10,391
Sure.

429
00:39:13,311 --> 00:39:14,521
Does your sister
live with you?

430
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:18,273
- Temporarily.
- Is she here right now?

431
00:39:20,527 --> 00:39:22,903
She's with my husband, but
she wasn't in the car.

432
00:39:28,909 --> 00:39:32,452
I was always jealous of families
that spent the holidays together.

433
00:39:32,454 --> 00:39:34,204
Never happened with mine.

434
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:37,499
No, my, uh, dad walked
out when I was seven

435
00:39:37,501 --> 00:39:40,880
and my mom drank herself to
death a few years later.

436
00:39:42,548 --> 00:39:44,673
I'm sorry,
that's terrible.

437
00:39:44,675 --> 00:39:49,804
Oh, no, no, no,
it was for the better.

438
00:39:49,806 --> 00:39:51,599
What doesn't kill you
and all, right?

439
00:39:56,896 --> 00:39:58,898
My partner says
I talk too much.

440
00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:01,609
Probably true.

441
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:14,122
I think
the coffee's ready.

442
00:40:35,726 --> 00:40:37,434
In my opinion, that's
nothing a little hair

443
00:40:37,436 --> 00:40:38,563
of the dog can't fix.

444
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:48,782
Mm, that hits the spot.

445
00:40:49,574 --> 00:40:50,950
Nice and strong.

446
00:40:51,826 --> 00:40:53,202
Thank you, Lindsey.

447
00:40:57,373 --> 00:40:59,125
Now where's the body?

448
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,797
It wasn't dead.
It limped into the woods.

449
00:41:07,384 --> 00:41:09,675
One minute you're alive

450
00:41:09,677 --> 00:41:10,636
and then, boom!

451
00:41:11,637 --> 00:41:12,681
Dead as a doornail.

452
00:41:17,726 --> 00:41:22,063
Detective,
where's your partner?

453
00:41:22,065 --> 00:41:33,657
He's running an errand.
You know, odds and ends.

454
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:35,202
Do you have any creamer?

455
00:42:15,744 --> 00:42:17,034
What the...

456
00:43:06,628 --> 00:43:07,629
I didn't open it.

457
00:43:10,632 --> 00:43:11,925
Holy shit.

458
00:43:22,351 --> 00:43:26,021
This is...
This is $50,000.

459
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:34,780
Fifty thousand
fucking dollars. Yes!

460
00:43:36,782 --> 00:43:38,201
- Merry Christmas.
- Shit.

461
00:43:40,036 --> 00:43:42,494
Lindsey barely makes
this much in a year.

462
00:43:42,496 --> 00:43:43,623
And that's before taxes.

463
00:43:44,833 --> 00:43:47,499
- I get it. I really do.
- No.

464
00:43:47,501 --> 00:43:50,168
You really don't.

465
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:51,670
She wanted to go to
Cozumel for our honeymoon

466
00:43:51,672 --> 00:43:54,382
but we ended up at some
Radisson in Daytona Beach.

467
00:43:54,384 --> 00:43:56,717
The breakfast buffet
wasn't even included.

468
00:43:56,719 --> 00:43:57,803
I mean, this...

469
00:44:00,514 --> 00:44:01,972
This is the break
we've been waiting for.

470
00:44:01,974 --> 00:44:02,933
We can...

471
00:44:04,143 --> 00:44:06,311
We can finally
get our heads above water.

472
00:44:09,858 --> 00:44:13,066
Even if that bag had
a million dollars

473
00:44:13,068 --> 00:44:15,737
it wouldn't fix anything.

474
00:44:15,739 --> 00:44:19,740
She has me on an allowance,
for Christ's sake.

475
00:44:19,742 --> 00:44:20,909
It's still true.

476
00:45:26,351 --> 00:45:27,391
Boo.

477
00:45:34,275 --> 00:45:35,693
Oh...

478
00:45:36,945 --> 00:45:39,445
Oh, no.

479
00:45:39,447 --> 00:45:42,407
My ex used to cry
all the time.

480
00:45:42,409 --> 00:45:43,952
It made me wanna
strangle her.

481
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:00,842
Better.

482
00:46:00,844 --> 00:46:01,845
Thank you.

483
00:46:05,139 --> 00:46:08,932
Look, I know
what you're thinking.

484
00:46:08,934 --> 00:46:10,226
You're gonna hold out.

485
00:46:10,228 --> 00:46:12,019
Not gonna talk.

486
00:46:12,021 --> 00:46:13,186
Protect your family.
Blah, blah, blah.

487
00:46:13,188 --> 00:46:15,856
It's all
very noble of you.

488
00:46:15,858 --> 00:46:17,233
But I have to tell you

489
00:46:17,235 --> 00:46:19,526
that now is not the time
for nobility.

490
00:46:25,492 --> 00:46:27,784
Some people say
the blood tastes sour

491
00:46:27,786 --> 00:46:30,037
like, aluminum.
That'd be the hemoglobin.

492
00:46:30,039 --> 00:46:33,874
Well, it's actually the iron in the
hemoglobin to be more precise.

493
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,836
Some people say
it tastes sweet.

494
00:46:37,838 --> 00:46:39,171
I bet that's the glucose.

495
00:46:39,173 --> 00:46:44,052
Sweet versus sour.
Must be something genetic.

496
00:46:44,054 --> 00:46:46,720
But I always wondered if somehow
it was connected to personalities.

497
00:46:46,722 --> 00:46:50,057
Like, like an astrological
sign or something.

498
00:46:50,059 --> 00:46:51,892
I'm a Scorpio, by the way.

499
00:46:51,894 --> 00:46:54,311
My astrologist says that we like
to get to the bottom of things.

500
00:46:54,313 --> 00:46:56,313
Which brings me
to my point.

501
00:46:56,315 --> 00:46:59,858
I can do this all day.
I could.

502
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:02,570
But eventually your lips will
begin to flay and at some point

503
00:47:02,572 --> 00:47:04,280
your teeth are just gonna
pop right through them

504
00:47:04,282 --> 00:47:07,367
and, pardon the pun,
but I'm sure your

505
00:47:07,369 --> 00:47:10,369
pretty smile's
a real asset at the bank.

506
00:47:10,371 --> 00:47:11,954
Wouldn't wanna ruin that,
now would we?

507
00:47:27,389 --> 00:47:29,889
Where's the body?

508
00:47:29,891 --> 00:47:32,057
In the garage,
we hit him with the car

509
00:47:32,059 --> 00:47:33,184
and then he attacked
my sister.

510
00:47:33,186 --> 00:47:34,601
Please, you can have...

511
00:47:34,603 --> 00:47:36,396
Shh... shh.

512
00:47:36,398 --> 00:47:38,940
Oh, you must be
a Capricorn.

513
00:47:38,942 --> 00:47:41,608
So honest and forthcoming.

514
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:43,528
There's a flip-side
to that, you know.

515
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:45,947
Yeah, Capricorns, they
get taken advantage of.

516
00:47:45,949 --> 00:47:48,240
Long hours at the bank.

517
00:47:48,242 --> 00:47:52,077
The boss copping a feel
when no one's looking.

518
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:56,081
And then it's home
to Jeff. Jeff.

519
00:47:56,083 --> 00:47:58,959
Yeah, I read about his go in the
College World Series. Ouch.

520
00:47:58,961 --> 00:48:04,798
Blowin' a lead in the bottom
of the ninth, that's rough.

521
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,050
Riddle me this, Lindsey

522
00:48:07,052 --> 00:48:08,677
how does someone like you

523
00:48:08,679 --> 00:48:11,555
a born go-getter

524
00:48:11,557 --> 00:48:15,519
end up with a testosterone-filled
joker like him?

525
00:48:39,126 --> 00:48:41,626
Gerome, he's my therapist

526
00:48:41,628 --> 00:48:43,628
he would have a field
day dissecting you.

527
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:46,507
All your fantasies
about white picket fences

528
00:48:46,509 --> 00:48:48,633
the prayers that Jeff
might turn a corner

529
00:48:48,635 --> 00:48:51,970
the desperate desire to fix
your screwed up little sister?

530
00:48:51,972 --> 00:48:54,057
The sad truth is

531
00:48:54,059 --> 00:48:56,184
you'll always be trapped
by the same dysfunctional

532
00:48:56,186 --> 00:48:58,396
relationships you try
so hard to escape.

533
00:49:02,817 --> 00:49:03,985
The cat got your tongue?

534
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:08,489
I didn't hear a question.

535
00:49:12,117 --> 00:49:12,951
Where did they go?

536
00:49:14,204 --> 00:49:17,954
You know...

537
00:49:17,956 --> 00:49:19,706
...she didn't tell me
she had a sister until

538
00:49:19,708 --> 00:49:22,168
we'd been dating for, um...

539
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:23,503
...three months.

540
00:49:23,505 --> 00:49:26,007
Is that supposed
to hurt my feelings?

541
00:49:29,844 --> 00:49:31,679
It wasn't that
she was ashamed.

542
00:49:32,889 --> 00:49:34,805
I don't know.

543
00:49:34,807 --> 00:49:36,891
Maybe she was. You'd
just been out of juvie.

544
00:49:36,893 --> 00:49:40,269
Just say whatever it is
you're trying to say.

545
00:49:40,271 --> 00:49:47,068
I'm not sure what she'll do when
we tell her about the money.

546
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:49,989
Okay,
I could ask nicely.

547
00:49:55,577 --> 00:49:57,412
Pretty please

548
00:49:57,414 --> 00:49:59,708
with a cherry on top?

549
00:50:07,382 --> 00:50:09,592
I think this might be
too much for her.

550
00:50:13,012 --> 00:50:20,351
You mean,
don't tell her?

551
00:50:20,353 --> 00:50:21,354
No.

552
00:50:23,106 --> 00:50:24,065
No.

553
00:50:26,275 --> 00:50:30,235
I'd never do that
to Lindsey.

554
00:50:30,237 --> 00:50:31,655
You passed the test.

555
00:50:44,793 --> 00:50:48,503
She's under a lot
of pressure, is all.

556
00:51:06,315 --> 00:51:07,940
Scorpio and Capricorn,
Lindsey.

557
00:51:07,942 --> 00:51:10,735
There is always a spark.

558
00:51:10,737 --> 00:51:12,072
Do you feel it?

559
00:51:16,076 --> 00:51:17,369
'Cause I sure do.

560
00:51:28,505 --> 00:51:30,965
If you need anything,
just whistle.

561
00:55:33,041 --> 00:55:34,125
Boo.

562
00:56:41,735 --> 00:56:43,443
Honey?

563
00:56:43,445 --> 00:56:44,571
In here.

564
00:56:55,456 --> 00:56:57,541
Hey, Linz,
whose car is that?

565
00:56:58,543 --> 00:56:59,711
You forgot to call.

566
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:05,505
We got it, hon.

567
00:57:05,507 --> 00:57:07,301
50 grand.

568
00:57:11,806 --> 00:57:14,391
Did you hear me?
$50,000.

569
00:57:17,103 --> 00:57:18,521
I heard you.

570
00:57:20,565 --> 00:57:21,813
What happened?

571
00:57:21,815 --> 00:57:22,817
Come on.

572
00:57:40,668 --> 00:57:41,752
He happened.

573
00:57:43,755 --> 00:57:45,923
He showed up
right after you left...

574
00:57:47,675 --> 00:57:54,639
...and he knows
everything about us.

575
00:57:58,603 --> 00:58:00,186
What are you doing?

576
00:58:00,188 --> 00:58:02,023
- Softening him up.
- Stop it.

577
00:58:03,525 --> 00:58:04,651
Please.

578
00:58:06,902 --> 00:58:08,195
Don't even look at her.

579
00:58:09,655 --> 00:58:11,863
Go back to your room.
We'll handle this.

580
00:58:11,865 --> 00:58:12,867
Now!

581
00:58:23,753 --> 00:58:25,213
Ready to talk, asshole?

582
00:58:33,722 --> 00:58:35,429
Who else knows
you're here?

583
00:58:37,266 --> 00:58:40,684
Sweet.

584
00:58:40,686 --> 00:58:41,813
It tastes sweet.

585
00:58:42,896 --> 00:58:45,523
No, no, no, no.

586
00:58:45,525 --> 00:58:46,526
Here's a thought.

587
00:58:48,027 --> 00:58:50,903
Let me talk
to your sister.

588
00:58:50,905 --> 00:58:54,449
You sent a man to kill her and
now you wanna talk to her?

589
00:58:54,451 --> 00:58:57,659
Either we settle this like civilized
beings or someone else dies.

590
00:58:57,661 --> 00:59:01,539
Maybe you, maybe me.

591
00:59:01,541 --> 00:59:04,583
No offense, but she doesn't look
like the type to chop off my balls

592
00:59:04,585 --> 00:59:06,293
and shove 'em down my
throat, now does she?

593
00:59:06,295 --> 00:59:07,713
She might listen.

594
00:59:11,675 --> 00:59:12,675
We'd be right here.

595
00:59:12,677 --> 00:59:14,052
No, no. Alone.

596
00:59:14,054 --> 00:59:17,472
Not a chance in hell.

597
00:59:17,474 --> 00:59:19,389
Come on, slugger.

598
00:59:19,391 --> 00:59:21,184
You don't want me to
tell her about the stash

599
00:59:21,186 --> 00:59:24,103
of Asian schoolgirl porn
you got in the cabinet...

600
00:59:27,067 --> 00:59:29,233
You're not getting
anywhere.

601
00:59:29,235 --> 00:59:30,403
Come on.

602
00:59:33,030 --> 00:59:35,615
It's like baseball,
Jeff.

603
00:59:35,617 --> 00:59:39,077
Sometimes you gotta call
in the relief pitcher.

604
00:59:39,079 --> 00:59:41,119
Especially
in the ninth inning.

605
00:59:45,043 --> 00:59:47,293
If there's porn in there,
he planted it.

606
00:59:47,295 --> 00:59:48,795
I don't care.

607
00:59:48,797 --> 00:59:50,796
I'm gonna go get Hannah.

608
00:59:50,798 --> 00:59:51,963
You're crazy to leave
her alone in there with him.

609
00:59:51,965 --> 00:59:53,759
There's more to her
than you think.

610
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:10,443
He wants to talk to you.

611
01:00:11,235 --> 01:00:12,901
Okay.

612
01:00:12,903 --> 01:00:14,864
- You don't have to...
- I said I'd do it.

613
01:00:16,949 --> 01:00:18,117
Are you sure?

614
01:00:19,661 --> 01:00:22,789
Do you know what it was
like after you left?

615
01:00:25,125 --> 01:00:27,874
'Cause our mom had
bad boyfriends before.

616
01:00:27,876 --> 01:00:30,422
I can't apologize
for leaving, Hannah.

617
01:00:32,757 --> 01:00:34,675
I didn't ask you to.

618
01:01:34,943 --> 01:01:36,862
I thought you were dead.

619
01:01:39,865 --> 01:01:41,574
- There was so much blood.
- No.

620
01:01:41,576 --> 01:01:43,911
It was not mine, babe.
Not mine.

621
01:01:45,204 --> 01:01:47,581
I told you that we would
always be together.

622
01:01:49,668 --> 01:01:52,003
Is that why you sent
that asshole after me?

623
01:01:53,797 --> 01:01:55,338
I had to make sure
that you were safe.

624
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:57,965
I was worried sick
about you.

625
01:01:57,967 --> 01:01:59,927
I missed my little,
Hannah banana.

626
01:02:01,804 --> 01:02:03,764
I missed you too.

627
01:02:06,934 --> 01:02:08,684
Cut me loose.

628
01:02:08,686 --> 01:02:09,894
It's startin' to hurt.

629
01:02:14,858 --> 01:02:16,358
You shouldn't have done
that to her.

630
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:18,860
Babe, for Christ's sake,
I asked her for creamer

631
01:02:18,862 --> 01:02:20,445
and she came at me
with a butcher knife.

632
01:02:20,447 --> 01:02:22,991
I would never hurt
your sister on purpose.

633
01:02:31,001 --> 01:02:32,919
Did you get the money?

634
01:02:33,836 --> 01:02:34,963
Yes.

635
01:02:35,838 --> 01:02:37,215
Good.

636
01:02:38,590 --> 01:02:40,800
Hey, we're gonna go
to Europe.

637
01:02:40,802 --> 01:02:42,135
Australia.

638
01:02:42,137 --> 01:02:44,679
See the pyramids.
You name it.

639
01:02:44,681 --> 01:02:46,016
Just the two of us.

640
01:02:49,978 --> 01:02:51,938
We can even split it
with them if you want.

641
01:02:55,108 --> 01:02:57,441
Does anyone else know
you're here?

642
01:02:57,443 --> 01:02:58,985
No, babe.

643
01:02:58,987 --> 01:03:00,739
We got a one-way
ticket out.

644
01:03:06,327 --> 01:03:08,079
When you disappeared...

645
01:03:09,496 --> 01:03:11,457
...I realized how I felt.

646
01:03:14,376 --> 01:03:15,668
I couldn't say it before

647
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:20,008
but... I love you.

648
01:03:26,556 --> 01:03:27,972
I can't let you go
right now.

649
01:03:27,974 --> 01:03:28,930
Just... just think
about this

650
01:03:28,932 --> 01:03:30,141
for a goddamn second, okay?

651
01:03:30,143 --> 01:03:32,726
Let me talk to them.

652
01:03:32,728 --> 01:03:33,811
I'll convince them
you'll be good

653
01:03:33,813 --> 01:03:35,356
to your word.

654
01:03:39,527 --> 01:03:41,026
How did it go?

655
01:03:41,028 --> 01:03:42,320
He said
he'll split it with us

656
01:03:42,322 --> 01:03:45,155
if we let him go.

657
01:03:45,157 --> 01:03:46,824
That's all he said?

658
01:03:46,826 --> 01:03:48,159
I think he means it.

659
01:03:48,161 --> 01:03:50,369
Look, we can't keep him
tied up forever.

660
01:04:01,965 --> 01:04:04,592
How can you be so naive?

661
01:04:04,594 --> 01:04:06,554
You wanna talk to me
about naive?

662
01:04:08,722 --> 01:04:10,889
There is a dead man
in your garage

663
01:04:10,891 --> 01:04:12,016
and a live one
in your basement

664
01:04:12,018 --> 01:04:13,684
and you are sitting
there eating

665
01:04:13,686 --> 01:04:17,021
a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich

666
01:04:17,023 --> 01:04:19,150
dreaming about
an island vacation.

667
01:04:22,903 --> 01:04:24,653
Fuck you, Jeff.

668
01:04:24,655 --> 01:04:33,537
Fuck you
and your $50,000.

669
01:04:44,634 --> 01:04:52,682
He's just trying
to keep us safe.

670
01:04:52,684 --> 01:04:57,353
What is it?

671
01:04:57,355 --> 01:04:59,523
It's okay.
You can tell me.

672
01:05:04,112 --> 01:05:07,490
When we were in the car...

673
01:05:09,742 --> 01:05:11,117
...he tried
to get me to say

674
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:13,038
that we didn't
find anything.

675
01:05:14,873 --> 01:05:16,499
He wanted to hide
the money from you.

676
01:05:18,001 --> 01:05:19,541
You must have misunderstood
what he meant.

677
01:05:19,543 --> 01:05:27,008
I didn't, Lindsey.

678
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:28,011
Lindsey...

679
01:05:29,304 --> 01:05:30,680
He wouldn't.

680
01:06:02,836 --> 01:06:04,963
You can't trust Jeff.

681
01:06:10,094 --> 01:06:12,638
Wait here. I might need
you in a bit, okay?

682
01:06:26,152 --> 01:06:28,235
She's lying.

683
01:06:28,237 --> 01:06:29,320
Why,
you don't believe me?

684
01:06:29,322 --> 01:06:40,164
I have to check something.

685
01:06:40,166 --> 01:06:41,960
It's the same.

686
01:06:43,043 --> 01:06:44,170
Linz?

687
01:06:48,382 --> 01:06:51,135
It reminds me that the
world is full of sheep.

688
01:06:52,137 --> 01:06:54,097
- Keeps me centered.
- Shut up.

689
01:06:55,849 --> 01:06:57,392
What, babe?

690
01:06:58,268 --> 01:07:00,726
Hannah's boyfriend.

691
01:07:00,728 --> 01:07:03,021
Richard, Smith,
it's the same guy!

692
01:07:03,023 --> 01:07:05,150
- It's his money!
- Him?

693
01:07:06,525 --> 01:07:08,443
Bottom of the ninth, Jeff.

694
01:07:08,445 --> 01:07:10,235
Lot of pressure.
Don't blow it.

695
01:07:10,237 --> 01:07:11,989
- You think that's funny?
- Stop!

696
01:07:14,074 --> 01:07:15,492
He'll break.

697
01:07:17,871 --> 01:07:20,371
He will.

698
01:07:20,373 --> 01:07:22,500
But not like that.

699
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:28,963
Tape his mouth.

700
01:07:58,994 --> 01:08:18,470
Here.

701
01:08:18,472 --> 01:08:20,641
You ever chip a nail,
detective?

702
01:08:22,268 --> 01:08:23,476
There are a lot of nerve
endings in the fingertips

703
01:08:23,478 --> 01:08:26,478
women deal with it
all the time.

704
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:28,397
Although we have
a higher threshold

705
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:29,983
for pain than men.

706
01:08:30,944 --> 01:08:32,404
Helps us with child birth.

707
01:08:33,947 --> 01:08:35,489
It's genetic.

708
01:08:43,872 --> 01:08:45,040
Right here.

709
01:08:50,796 --> 01:08:52,548
Guess I'm
the relief pitcher.

710
01:09:02,725 --> 01:09:04,058
Again.

711
01:09:19,324 --> 01:09:20,409
Another.

712
01:09:33,381 --> 01:09:36,382
That's three.

713
01:09:36,384 --> 01:09:39,259
There are seven more.

714
01:09:39,261 --> 01:09:42,222
Seventeen, if you wanna
press your luck.

715
01:09:45,393 --> 01:09:46,476
When I take this tape off

716
01:09:46,478 --> 01:09:48,018
I want you to start
at the beginning.

717
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:49,355
Do you understand me?

718
01:10:19,927 --> 01:10:21,470
She hasn't changed
at all.

719
01:10:31,271 --> 01:10:33,481
You still got me.

720
01:10:33,483 --> 01:10:39,611
That's worth somethin'.

721
01:10:39,613 --> 01:10:42,197
It'll be dark
in two hours.

722
01:10:42,199 --> 01:10:43,326
I know.

723
01:10:48,163 --> 01:10:50,125
Both bodies
will fit in the car.

724
01:10:52,668 --> 01:10:54,460
We can't murder him, Jeff.

725
01:10:54,462 --> 01:10:55,797
It's self defense.

726
01:10:57,172 --> 01:11:00,340
Smith, Richard,
whoever the fuck

727
01:11:00,342 --> 01:11:02,343
this guy is,
he's gonna be after us

728
01:11:02,345 --> 01:11:04,305
as long as he's alive.

729
01:11:05,515 --> 01:11:06,891
You know that.

730
01:11:12,896 --> 01:11:14,440
What would we do after?

731
01:11:15,984 --> 01:11:17,733
There's a dumpster
out on Route 4...

732
01:11:17,735 --> 01:11:21,111
No, Jeff,
what would we do?

733
01:11:21,113 --> 01:11:22,112
I go back
to the bank tomorrow

734
01:11:22,114 --> 01:11:23,613
like nothing happened?

735
01:11:23,615 --> 01:11:27,369
You keep dry-walling
and handing out resumes?

736
01:11:31,916 --> 01:11:33,540
We'll pick up the pieces

737
01:11:33,542 --> 01:11:34,750
and move on
like we always have.

738
01:11:34,752 --> 01:11:37,503
Where has that gotten us?

739
01:11:37,505 --> 01:11:39,171
I mean, look around, this
isn't what we planned.

740
01:11:39,173 --> 01:11:40,507
You don't think
I know that?

741
01:11:43,802 --> 01:11:47,054
It's just a bump
in the road, Lindsey.

742
01:11:47,056 --> 01:11:49,682
Once we deal
with this mess...

743
01:11:49,684 --> 01:11:51,267
...and once we deal
with your sister...

744
01:11:51,269 --> 01:11:53,061
Whoa! What do you mean,
deal with my sister?

745
01:11:53,063 --> 01:11:55,398
- She lied to you.
- He manipulated her.

746
01:11:56,649 --> 01:11:59,608
Look, we just need her
out of the way

747
01:11:59,610 --> 01:12:01,652
for a couple of hours
while we deal with this

748
01:12:01,654 --> 01:12:03,406
little shit show of hers.

749
01:12:05,199 --> 01:12:07,575
When this is all
settled down

750
01:12:07,577 --> 01:12:10,327
we'll, um, use the money...

751
01:12:10,329 --> 01:12:12,955
...to set her up someplace.

752
01:12:12,957 --> 01:12:14,918
Get her back on her feet.

753
01:12:16,336 --> 01:12:17,462
Do you mean that?

754
01:12:18,421 --> 01:12:19,798
Yeah.

755
01:12:23,342 --> 01:12:26,134
Do I have your word
she won't get hurt?

756
01:12:26,136 --> 01:12:27,680
Scout's honor.

757
01:12:30,516 --> 01:12:32,644
She betrayed you,
you know.

758
01:12:34,395 --> 01:12:36,523
But she's family.

759
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:41,277
So am I.

760
01:13:12,016 --> 01:13:13,559
It's time.

761
01:13:33,537 --> 01:13:35,955
I always hated finance.

762
01:13:35,957 --> 01:13:37,248
But you work in a bank.

763
01:13:37,250 --> 01:13:39,210
Funny how life turns out.

764
01:13:45,884 --> 01:13:48,509
- You kept it?
- Yeah.

765
01:13:48,511 --> 01:13:50,469
All this shit over
one little piece of paper.

766
01:13:50,471 --> 01:13:54,182
It just didn't feel right
to throw it away.

767
01:13:54,184 --> 01:13:58,186
Let's go.

768
01:14:35,225 --> 01:14:36,559
I fucked up.

769
01:14:39,979 --> 01:14:41,771
I have to tell you
something.

770
01:14:41,773 --> 01:14:42,897
It's about Richard.

771
01:14:42,899 --> 01:14:45,525
It's just he's the guy
in the basement.

772
01:14:45,527 --> 01:14:47,693
I know.

773
01:14:47,695 --> 01:14:50,655
You're not mad?

774
01:14:50,657 --> 01:14:52,617
Do you love him?

775
01:14:53,618 --> 01:14:54,786
I don't know.

776
01:15:08,173 --> 01:15:10,633
It's gonna be alright.

777
01:15:10,635 --> 01:15:11,802
Come on.

778
01:15:23,731 --> 01:15:26,443
Let me go! Let me go!

779
01:15:46,962 --> 01:15:50,214
Hannah, Listen to me.
Shh, shh, shh. It's me.

780
01:15:50,216 --> 01:15:51,465
Look, whatever
they have in mind

781
01:15:51,467 --> 01:15:52,508
isn't good
for either of us

782
01:15:52,510 --> 01:15:53,843
so you gotta do
exactly what I say

783
01:15:53,845 --> 01:15:55,344
and we'll get
out of this. Okay?

784
01:15:55,346 --> 01:15:57,179
- Now, follow my voice.
- Okay.

785
01:15:57,181 --> 01:15:58,638
And get as close
as possible.

786
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:00,558
You got it.

787
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:01,686
Straight back.

788
01:16:03,270 --> 01:16:04,438
There you go.

789
01:16:07,274 --> 01:16:09,817
What if she can't breathe?

790
01:16:09,819 --> 01:16:10,985
You ever get
five minutes of peace

791
01:16:10,987 --> 01:16:13,821
and quiet
when she's around?

792
01:16:13,823 --> 01:16:16,531
She's got strong lungs.

793
01:16:16,533 --> 01:16:18,744
I'm gonna get the gun
and a couple of pillows.

794
01:16:27,878 --> 01:16:29,631
There you go.

795
01:16:30,590 --> 01:16:31,716
One more, one more.

796
01:16:33,134 --> 01:16:35,679
Okay, now try
to get onto your knees.

797
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:40,430
There you go.

798
01:16:53,613 --> 01:16:55,073
Little bit more.

799
01:16:56,699 --> 01:16:59,701
Listen to me, we are gonna
get through this, okay?

800
01:16:59,703 --> 01:17:01,119
I need you to get
the wolf's head charm

801
01:17:01,121 --> 01:17:02,245
from your bracelet.

802
01:17:02,247 --> 01:17:04,455
It's sharp,
you can cut with that.

803
01:17:04,457 --> 01:17:06,040
Got it.

804
01:17:06,042 --> 01:17:10,005
Yeah, that's right,
227 Thayer Drive.

805
01:17:11,797 --> 01:17:13,966
Please just come
as soon as you can.

806
01:17:17,177 --> 01:17:19,553
What are you doin'?

807
01:17:19,555 --> 01:17:21,723
Why two pillows?

808
01:17:21,725 --> 01:17:24,058
The money's gone
and you have two pillows.

809
01:17:24,060 --> 01:17:25,228
Why?

810
01:17:34,904 --> 01:17:37,571
- Help me!
- Shh, shh, shh.

811
01:17:37,573 --> 01:17:38,822
They could hear us.

812
01:17:38,824 --> 01:17:40,617
Just give me
a second, okay?

813
01:17:55,007 --> 01:17:57,215
Just like a Band-Aid.

814
01:17:57,217 --> 01:17:59,970
Just like a big
fucking Band-Aid.

815
01:18:03,891 --> 01:18:06,019
If the money's gone...

816
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:08,477
...your sister took it.

817
01:18:08,479 --> 01:18:10,022
I asked you a question.

818
01:18:12,775 --> 01:18:14,858
To muffle the shots.
Now, put the gun down.

819
01:18:14,860 --> 01:18:17,445
Shots? Plural?

820
01:18:17,447 --> 01:18:18,528
One person,
one shot, one pillow.

821
01:18:18,530 --> 01:18:20,781
What do you think this is?

822
01:18:20,783 --> 01:18:21,951
Huh?

823
01:18:22,827 --> 01:18:25,827
A goddamned fairy tale?

824
01:18:25,829 --> 01:18:26,954
Wake up.

825
01:18:26,956 --> 01:18:28,915
Hannah is not on our side.

826
01:18:28,917 --> 01:18:30,835
This isn't about sides.

827
01:18:32,378 --> 01:18:34,419
Well...

828
01:18:34,421 --> 01:18:36,173
...that's exactly...

829
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:39,217
...what this is about.

830
01:18:39,219 --> 01:18:40,761
No! No!

831
01:18:42,889 --> 01:18:44,513
- Please, Richard, untie me!
- Hold on.

832
01:18:44,515 --> 01:18:46,598
It hurts me, it really,
really hurts.

833
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:47,726
Shh, shh, shh.

834
01:18:52,940 --> 01:18:55,443
Please let me go.
Please.

835
01:19:15,671 --> 01:19:17,004
You know, I've gotten
a lot of ass

836
01:19:17,006 --> 01:19:21,968
over the years...

837
01:19:21,970 --> 01:19:24,387
...but yours was
definitely the sweetest.

838
01:19:24,389 --> 01:19:27,141
Calm down, calm down,
calm down!

839
01:19:28,976 --> 01:19:30,561
She's my sister.

840
01:19:33,398 --> 01:19:34,940
I don't care.

841
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:37,900
I do.

842
01:19:47,871 --> 01:19:48,997
Honey?

843
01:19:49,872 --> 01:19:51,705
Go to sleep.

844
01:20:40,465 --> 01:20:42,007
We made a vow.

845
01:20:44,719 --> 01:20:56,228
Remember?

846
01:20:56,230 --> 01:20:58,190
We can tell each
other anything.

847
01:21:02,945 --> 01:21:06,155
You want her
out of your life.

848
01:21:06,157 --> 01:21:07,534
So do I.

849
01:21:18,461 --> 01:21:20,630
Brutal honesty, Linz.

850
01:21:23,507 --> 01:21:25,299
That's what marriage is.

851
01:21:39,983 --> 01:21:41,566
Goddamn it!

852
01:21:44,779 --> 01:21:45,986
Don't...

853
01:21:47,573 --> 01:21:49,574
Please, Lindsey...

854
01:21:49,576 --> 01:21:52,117
...don't make me
hurt you.

855
01:21:52,119 --> 01:21:53,452
I love you too much.

856
01:21:53,454 --> 01:21:54,495
You don't even know
what that means.

857
01:21:54,497 --> 01:21:56,539
Yes, I do.

858
01:21:56,541 --> 01:21:59,709
Everything I did,
I did for us.

859
01:21:59,711 --> 01:22:01,544
Don't you
understand that?

860
01:22:01,546 --> 01:22:03,088
You're out of your mind.

861
01:22:05,925 --> 01:22:07,886
We're gonna
work this out...

862
01:22:08,677 --> 01:22:11,178
...or die trying.

863
01:22:18,145 --> 01:22:19,480
Hello, Lindsey.

864
01:22:49,844 --> 01:22:51,134
You've got a lot
more fight

865
01:22:51,136 --> 01:22:54,179
than your sister did.
I like that.

866
01:24:31,237 --> 01:24:35,031
Scorpio and Capricorn,
Lindsey.

867
01:24:35,033 --> 01:24:38,910
Can you imagine if we met
when we were single?

868
01:24:38,912 --> 01:24:40,872
Well, technically...

869
01:24:41,706 --> 01:24:43,667
...I guess we are.

870
01:24:46,168 --> 01:24:47,711
What do you say?

871
01:25:13,070 --> 01:25:15,571
- Drop the gun! Do it now!
- Last chance!

872
01:25:49,690 --> 01:25:51,607
All units, all units...

873
01:26:14,673 --> 01:26:17,301
Mrs. Pittman, we're here.

874
01:26:21,305 --> 01:26:23,848
Ma'am, I really think
it'd be best for you

875
01:26:23,850 --> 01:26:26,933
to stay with
someone tonight.

876
01:26:26,935 --> 01:26:28,393
I think right now
I just need to sleep

877
01:26:28,395 --> 01:26:30,564
for a very long time.

878
01:26:31,315 --> 01:26:32,982
Well, don't go too far.

879
01:26:32,984 --> 01:26:35,276
We'll have more questions
for you when you're ready.

880
01:26:35,278 --> 01:26:36,404
Of course.

881
01:26:42,409 --> 01:26:45,745
Ma'am, this place is
miles away from anything.

882
01:26:45,747 --> 01:26:46,789
Why here?

883
01:26:49,542 --> 01:26:51,920
Because it's miles
away from anything.

884
01:26:56,841 --> 01:26:58,674
You take care,
Mrs. Pittman.

885
01:26:58,676 --> 01:26:59,760
I will.

886
01:27:09,688 --> 01:27:11,815
That was a bad scene,
man.

887
01:27:12,564 --> 01:27:14,733
And all over 50 grand.

888
01:27:16,985 --> 01:27:19,946
Think she'll be okay?

889
01:27:19,948 --> 01:27:22,572
Yeah, I do.

890
01:27:22,574 --> 01:27:23,952
She's a survivor.

891
01:27:26,287 --> 01:27:29,580
Hey, let's hit
that diner over on 87

892
01:27:29,582 --> 01:27:30,873
for some corned beef
and cabbage?

893
01:27:30,875 --> 01:27:33,334
- Oh. No, no.
- It's a tradition.

894
01:27:33,336 --> 01:27:36,044
Have at it.
I'll stick with a burger.

895
01:28:18,672 --> 01:28:20,505
Happy New Year.

896
01:28:20,507 --> 01:28:22,424
It's after midnight.

897
01:28:22,426 --> 01:28:24,259
Whatever.

898
01:28:39,652 --> 01:28:42,695
Now, weren't
you here earlier?

899
01:28:42,697 --> 01:28:45,406
- That was my sister.
- Oh.

900
01:28:45,408 --> 01:28:47,950
Oh, oh, yeah. Yeah.

901
01:28:47,952 --> 01:28:51,079
The... the one
who... who got the bag

902
01:28:51,081 --> 01:28:53,248
and put it back.

903
01:28:55,335 --> 01:28:58,503
Said she'd come
get it tomorrow.

904
01:28:58,505 --> 01:29:03,340
Uh, although, uh,
I guess that's today.

905
01:29:03,342 --> 01:29:05,095
She's not coming back.

906
01:30:39,025 --> 01:30:44,025
