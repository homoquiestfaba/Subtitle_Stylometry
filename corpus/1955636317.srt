1
00:00:35,927 --> 00:00:40,815
I am a headhunter and I am
the purest form of salesman alive.

2
00:00:40,857 --> 00:00:43,018
I sell the American dream.

3
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:46,563
I make money out of thin air,
smoke, whole cloth.

4
00:00:46,605 --> 00:00:48,940
I stand on the shoulders of giants,

5
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:51,109
the hardest of hardened salesmen.

6
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:55,072
Tin men, bible salesmen, slum realtors.

7
00:00:55,113 --> 00:00:58,325
We're a wolf pack of commissioned
phone jockeys working

8
00:00:58,367 --> 00:01:01,804
70 hours a week without a net.
You hit, you hit big.

9
00:01:01,845 --> 00:01:04,247
You blank, and the repo man's tailgating

10
00:01:04,289 --> 00:01:06,124
the minivan at the grocery store.

11
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:10,379
This job is a desk, a phone,
a chair and your ass.

12
00:01:11,963 --> 00:01:14,549
Good morning,
Imperial Automotive Manufacturing,

13
00:01:14,591 --> 00:01:15,884
Dottie speaking.

14
00:01:15,926 --> 00:01:17,936
I am who I say I am.

15
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:18,930
Johnny Cobra calling, Dot.

16
00:01:18,931 --> 00:01:20,890
Need the name of your
Plant Manager, please.

17
00:01:20,931 --> 00:01:23,558
I'm sorry, but it's
against company policy

18
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,353
to give out names of employees.
Nature of your business, sir?

19
00:01:26,395 --> 00:01:28,313
The nature of
my business, Dottie, is that

20
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:29,875
I'm down here at the Nissan plant with

21
00:01:29,915 --> 00:01:32,609
a shut-down line costing me
ninety grand a minute

22
00:01:32,651 --> 00:01:35,445
because your Quality Department
thinks they can run a freightliner

23
00:01:35,487 --> 00:01:38,657
full of injection molded crap
down my goddamn throat!

24
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:41,785
The person that you need to
speak to is Mr. Rayburn, I'll…

25
00:01:41,827 --> 00:01:43,829
First name, first name, first name.

26
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,455
Thomas is his first name.

27
00:01:45,497 --> 00:01:47,165
Dottie./ What?

28
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:49,376
Relax. Take a deep breath.
Pat yourself on the back,

29
00:01:49,418 --> 00:01:51,920
you're doing one helluva job./
Well, thank you,

30
00:01:51,962 --> 00:01:55,048
uh, Mr… did you say "Cobra"?

31
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,217
Call me Johnny.

32
00:01:57,259 --> 00:02:00,387
Dot, tell me, what's the story on Tom?
Big guy, small guy,

33
00:02:00,429 --> 00:02:03,890
young, old, play sports, college boy,
what am I dealing with?

34
00:02:03,932 --> 00:02:06,226
I know Tommy does play golf a lot.

35
00:02:06,268 --> 00:02:08,904
He's been working here
a couple three years, probably…

36
00:02:08,946 --> 00:02:11,814
Oh, chitchat's over, Dot.
Boss is on my ass.

37
00:02:11,816 --> 00:02:13,242
Go on patch me through.

38
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:17,529
Rayburn./ Tom.

39
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:20,532
Dane Jensen, Blackridge Recruiting.
Thanks for taking my call.

40
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:22,868
Yeah, hold up, hold up, bud.
Lemme save us both some time.

41
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:25,454
I'm not lookin' to make
a move right just yet.

42
00:02:25,495 --> 00:02:27,830
Rough as things are out there,
I'm just happy to have the job

43
00:02:27,831 --> 00:02:30,167
I got.
Now I'm up to my ass in alligators

44
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:33,003
so if you'll excuse me…/
Sweet. Baby. Jesus.

45
00:02:33,044 --> 00:02:36,047
I cannot believe my guy
was wrong about you.

46
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:39,885
Scuse me? Your guy? What guy?/
This isn't a random call, Tom.

47
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:42,345
I was told by a confidential source

48
00:02:42,387 --> 00:02:46,057
that even if your golf game was more
screwed up than a soup sandwich,

49
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,977
you're one of the premier
Plant Managers in the South.

50
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:52,147
He also told me even though
you've only been at Imperial

51
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:54,024
for three years,
that you were bright enough

52
00:02:54,065 --> 00:02:55,900
to at least listen to
what I was recruiting for

53
00:02:55,901 --> 00:02:59,738
before making up your mind.

54
00:03:01,156 --> 00:03:05,160
So. You're a headhunter, huh?

55
00:03:05,202 --> 00:03:08,914
I am a headhunter.
And a headhunter cometh.

56
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:12,125
What's the deal with this gut, son?

57
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:15,295
You need to get some exercise,
buddy, you're starting to look like

58
00:03:15,337 --> 00:03:17,172
the kind of kid Willy Wonka'd kick out

59
00:03:17,214 --> 00:03:18,632
of the chocolate factory.

60
00:03:18,673 --> 00:03:20,175
Hands up.

61
00:03:20,217 --> 00:03:22,302
I dunno, we could play a little football

62
00:03:22,344 --> 00:03:24,679
when you get home tonight./
If it's still light out

63
00:03:24,721 --> 00:03:28,141
and I don't have
any calls to make, we'll see.

64
00:03:36,233 --> 00:03:38,944
Good morning./ Hey, hon.

65
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:40,654
Ryan eat breakfast?

66
00:03:40,695 --> 00:03:43,657
If you can call it that./
He likes cereal and it's easy.

67
00:03:43,698 --> 00:03:47,077
Of course he does, Elise,
what kid doesn't like

68
00:03:47,118 --> 00:03:48,827
colored marshmallows
swimming in whole milk?

69
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:50,914
It's a Momma.

70
00:03:54,084 --> 00:03:56,962
I like your hair, Lauren,

71
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:59,548
looks good on you.

72
00:03:59,589 --> 00:04:02,634
The point is, he's a mess./
Shh! Be quiet, he'll hear you!

73
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:05,345
Anyway, I made an appointment
for him to see the doctor.

74
00:04:05,387 --> 00:04:07,305
What the hell for, his weight?

75
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:11,135
No! I told you a week ago, he's tired
all the time and those bruises…

76
00:04:11,177 --> 00:04:13,925
Bruises?/ Mom, can I
have chocolate milk?

77
00:04:13,937 --> 00:04:17,482
Sure you can, baby./ Yeah, just a sec.

78
00:04:20,836 --> 00:04:23,602
Who's calling you so early?/
Just some candidate.

79
00:04:23,613 --> 00:04:26,241
Pushing sixty and wonders
why he can't find a job.

80
00:04:26,283 --> 00:04:29,327
Because of his age?
That's awful.

81
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:30,287
Okay.

82
00:04:32,728 --> 00:04:33,999
Gotta go.

83
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,034
I was thinking maybe
I could drive into the city,

84
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:37,444
we could get lunch.

85
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:42,290
First of the month, hon, swamped.
Call me! Oh.

86
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:53,744
I'm done talking about it!
Either manage Bob to get a deal

87
00:04:53,985 --> 00:04:56,187
or make the son of a bitch
quit so I don't have to pay

88
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,189
unemployment on his lazy ass.

89
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:00,483
Ed, how do you propose
I force the man to quit?

90
00:05:00,525 --> 00:05:01,985
For Christ sake, Wilson,

91
00:05:02,027 --> 00:05:05,280
have a little fun for a change.

92
00:05:05,322 --> 00:05:08,450
You know what I love about this place?

93
00:05:08,491 --> 00:05:09,826
I'm on pins and needles.

94
00:05:09,868 --> 00:05:12,954
Ed only cares about making money.

95
00:05:12,996 --> 00:05:15,206
Man, woman, black, white, old or young,

96
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:18,877
doesn't matter as long as
you're a producer.

97
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:21,087
Bob, were you not here
this past Saturday or Sunday?

98
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:24,049
No, I don't think anyone was here.

99
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,302
You blanked for three months./
I got two kids,

100
00:05:27,344 --> 00:05:28,762
my wife had divorced me,

101
00:05:28,803 --> 00:05:30,513
I started coming in on the weekends.

102
00:05:30,555 --> 00:05:33,725
Ah, wife and two kids, I see.
You're gonna score in October?

103
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:36,019
I'm sure gonna try my best.

104
00:05:36,061 --> 00:05:39,689
Try? Your attitude is to try?
Bob…

105
00:05:39,731 --> 00:05:41,106
You know what I hate about this place?

106
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:42,318
Nope.

107
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,028
Ed only cares about making money.

108
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,487
That's why he tolerates you
and your mouthbreathers.

109
00:05:46,488 --> 00:05:49,282
My mouthbreathers make more placements

110
00:05:49,324 --> 00:05:52,327
and out-produce those Ivy Leaguers
you coddle every month.

111
00:05:52,369 --> 00:05:55,664
What about an attitude that says
"I'll do whatever it takes,

112
00:05:55,705 --> 00:05:58,083
"I'll work whatever hours necessary,

113
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:03,505
in order to justify your
financial commitment to me, Ed"?

114
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:08,718
Oh…

115
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,305
Bob…

116
00:06:12,347 --> 00:06:15,934
Are you going to get a deal?!

117
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:19,145
Yes! Yes, sir.

118
00:06:19,187 --> 00:06:22,941
Attaboy, Bob. Now get
the fuck back on the phone.

119
00:06:31,074 --> 00:06:34,411
Bet the place is full this weekend.

120
00:06:34,452 --> 00:06:38,665
But… if and when Bob leaves,

121
00:06:38,707 --> 00:06:40,625
then keep your ears open.

122
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:42,627
If he breaches his non-compete

123
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:45,004
and calls just one of our clients,

124
00:06:45,046 --> 00:06:46,756
I will sue him so deep and hard,

125
00:06:46,798 --> 00:06:48,967
that he, his wide-assed
Junior League wife,

126
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:52,011
and their two brats will be
sleeping in a cardboard box

127
00:06:52,053 --> 00:06:54,472
under the overpass on Whacker.

128
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:57,809
There's always someone
that thinks they can hang up

129
00:06:57,851 --> 00:07:00,645
their own shingle, and skip on
down to the home office

130
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:03,815
in their skivvies and make
phone calls while the rug rats frolic

131
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:07,152
at their feet. It makes me
want to puke blood.

132
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:09,446
In 35 years,

133
00:07:09,487 --> 00:07:12,365
I have never let anyone
slide on their non-compete.

134
00:07:16,995 --> 00:07:19,456
I leave for Prague in two days.

135
00:07:19,497 --> 00:07:20,915
Prague?

136
00:07:20,957 --> 00:07:23,543
You want her to tell you where it is?

137
00:07:23,585 --> 00:07:28,089
I know where Prague is.
Overseas.

138
00:07:28,131 --> 00:07:31,801
I want to spend more time
away from the place, travel,

139
00:07:31,843 --> 00:07:35,597
indulge my inner Kerouac.

140
00:07:35,638 --> 00:07:38,391
Time to finalize that succession
plan that we dance around

141
00:07:38,433 --> 00:07:39,851
and never do anything about.

142
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:42,687
I won't give up control immediately,

143
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:45,190
but one of you will get the job.

144
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:49,569
Whoever takes this last quarter
can move into the empty office

145
00:07:49,611 --> 00:07:52,322
next to this one.
You'll get off a desk

146
00:07:52,363 --> 00:07:53,698
and you'll receive overrides

147
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,825
from every recruiter at Blackridge.

148
00:07:55,867 --> 00:08:00,038
I'll announce the new General Manager
the first of the year. Understood?

149
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,499
One hundred percent, Ed./ Understood.

150
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:06,544
Wilson, beat it.

151
00:08:22,977 --> 00:08:25,480
The hell is that?/ Cobra wine.

152
00:08:25,522 --> 00:08:29,734
Spotted it in a small village in Vietnam
last month, thought of you.

153
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:32,027
You're supposed to drink it?/
Don't be such an American.

154
00:08:32,028 --> 00:08:33,613
Of course you drink it.

155
00:08:33,655 --> 00:08:36,991
But I'm determined to save it
for a special occasion.

156
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:39,828
Maybe the next time I do
something truly remarkable.

157
00:08:39,869 --> 00:08:41,204
Such as?

158
00:08:41,246 --> 00:08:43,540
I haven't settled on that as yet.

159
00:08:43,581 --> 00:08:46,292
How about a record-breaking October?

160
00:08:46,334 --> 00:08:48,252
What makes a person remarkable
is the life they live,

161
00:08:48,253 --> 00:08:49,671
not the money they make.

162
00:08:49,712 --> 00:08:51,631
Spoken like a man with a lot of money.

163
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,386
I may never uncork that wine.

164
00:08:57,427 --> 00:08:59,055
Ryan…

165
00:08:59,097 --> 00:09:01,599
Ryan, wake up, pal.

166
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:05,019
What time is it?/ 6:30. Come on.

167
00:09:05,061 --> 00:09:07,897
Let's get some roadwork in
before school.

168
00:09:07,939 --> 00:09:09,440
Roadwork?

169
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:17,156
Dad! I need to rest.

170
00:09:17,198 --> 00:09:19,868
Why don't I just carry you?

171
00:09:19,909 --> 00:09:23,538
I'm walking./ You're jogging.

172
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,590
Morning, ladies!

173
00:09:30,334 --> 00:09:31,880
Alright.

174
00:09:31,921 --> 00:09:34,757
Let's just walk.

175
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:37,635
Why don't we go to Catholic school?

176
00:09:39,554 --> 00:09:42,473
We're lapsed Catholics.

177
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:43,850
The good Lord wants us to spend

178
00:09:43,892 --> 00:09:45,894
Sunday mornings at Cracker Barrel.

179
00:09:45,935 --> 00:09:48,313
I'm with the Lord.

180
00:09:50,231 --> 00:09:52,191
How come Lauren doesn't have to jog?

181
00:09:52,233 --> 00:09:54,652
'Cause Lauren doesn't have
to lose weight.

182
00:09:56,571 --> 00:09:59,198
First step in solving a problem
is recognizing it, buddy.

183
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,701
Did you and Grandpa go jogging
when you were a kid

184
00:10:01,743 --> 00:10:05,079
in St. Louis?/ No, not hardly.

185
00:10:05,121 --> 00:10:06,539
He went to work when it was dark,

186
00:10:06,581 --> 00:10:07,665
came home when it was dark.

187
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:10,001
Wasn't much fun, was he?

188
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:12,712
Eh, he did the job.

189
00:10:14,454 --> 00:10:17,133
"Kinfe," "Sizhong," "Deepak",

190
00:10:17,175 --> 00:10:19,844
don't get me going on the red dots.

191
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:21,387
Here's an invoice begging to be sent.

192
00:10:21,429 --> 00:10:24,724
"Ping."
Interview a Chinese engineer yet?

193
00:10:24,766 --> 00:10:27,226
Treat yourself. It's like having
a conversation in the dark

194
00:10:27,268 --> 00:10:29,103
with Astro from the Jetsons.

195
00:10:29,145 --> 00:10:31,856
Look, Sumner,

196
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:33,398
I should have spent
more time with you, okay.

197
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,734
My fault. Let's start over.

198
00:10:34,776 --> 00:10:37,779
We are the "Dixie Mafia."
Okay, Dixie.

199
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,073
The South. You know,
state's rights, NASCAR,

200
00:10:40,114 --> 00:10:42,283
closeted atheists, poor spellers.

201
00:10:42,325 --> 00:10:43,701
I'm not an idiot, Mr. Jensen.

202
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:46,579
Okay. Role-play with me, alright.

203
00:10:46,621 --> 00:10:48,706
I'm a client from
Hattiesburg, Mississippi and

204
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:50,291
I'm looking for a process engineer.

205
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:54,379
So go on, pitch me one of your PhD's.

206
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,298
Ahem! Ring! Ring!

207
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:00,635
Darrel Waltrip here!/
Uh, yes, Mr. Waltrip?

208
00:11:00,677 --> 00:11:03,304
Darrel, son.
What can I do you for?

209
00:11:03,346 --> 00:11:04,846
Well, Darrel, I'm calling about your…

210
00:11:04,847 --> 00:11:07,350
Who the hell is this?

211
00:11:07,392 --> 00:11:08,684
Sumner, Sumner Firestone
from Blackridge Recruiting.

212
00:11:08,685 --> 00:11:09,978
Spit it out, I'm a busy man!

213
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:13,481
Uh… well, I've got a guy, he's uh,

214
00:11:13,523 --> 00:11:15,858
for your open engineering
position I mean,

215
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,236
he's got two degrees in
Mechanical Engineering,

216
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:19,820
experience reducing waste in the plants.

217
00:11:19,821 --> 00:11:21,489
Sounds stronger than puppy's breath.

218
00:11:21,531 --> 00:11:22,489
Now, when can he get down here?

219
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:26,536
Well, he can be there Friday?/
You asking me or telling me?

220
00:11:26,577 --> 00:11:28,204
I'm telling you.
He'll be there Friday.

221
00:11:28,246 --> 00:11:30,790
Friday it is! By the by,

222
00:11:30,832 --> 00:11:33,751
he wouldn't happen to have
one of those PhD's, would he?

223
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,211
As a matter of fact, he does.

224
00:11:35,253 --> 00:11:37,964
Perfect!
Better'n a new set of snow tires!

225
00:11:38,006 --> 00:11:40,633
Now, what's his name?

226
00:11:40,675 --> 00:11:43,928
Mohammed Al Far…

227
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:47,098
Your sleeper-cell starter kits

228
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:51,394
are unemployable south of the grit-line!

229
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,111
Alright. Cowboy up, sunshine.

230
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:03,181
Use this guy. Lou Wheeler.

231
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:06,325
Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering,
Six Sigma experience,

232
00:12:06,367 --> 00:12:08,161
and an age-vague voice.

233
00:12:08,202 --> 00:12:10,913
"Age-vague"?/ Yeah. He's 59,

234
00:12:10,955 --> 00:12:13,541
sounds like he's 39, and
refuses to change the dates

235
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,334
on his resume, and is unemployable.

236
00:12:15,376 --> 00:12:17,336
Why unemployable?

237
00:12:17,378 --> 00:12:21,591
He's 59 and refuses to lie about it.
God, you and my wife.

238
00:12:21,632 --> 00:12:24,385
Okay… so why do I want him?

239
00:12:24,427 --> 00:12:27,138
Because we will

240
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,807
take 15 years off Lou's resume.

241
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:31,183
Right, but once he goes
in for the interview,

242
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:32,267
they'll just see how old he is, I mean,

243
00:12:32,268 --> 00:12:34,145
what's the point?

244
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:35,437
We don't send him on an interview.

245
00:12:35,438 --> 00:12:38,232
Lou's what you call a Tracer Bullet.

246
00:12:38,274 --> 00:12:40,735
A tracer bullet, you know?

247
00:12:40,777 --> 00:12:41,861
A round that lights up

248
00:12:41,903 --> 00:12:43,737
so you know where to fire
the rest of the real bullets.

249
00:12:43,738 --> 00:12:46,019
I know what a tracer bullet is,
I just don't understand…

250
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:47,575
..."Relatively Young Lou"

251
00:12:47,617 --> 00:12:49,367
is a sure-fire bet for
a phone interview, okay?

252
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:52,121
But once he's off the line
with a paying customer,

253
00:12:52,163 --> 00:12:54,874
you bleed "Actually Old Lou"
for information.

254
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,834
Like, "What projects
are they working on?"

255
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:59,087
"What specifically did they ask you?"

256
00:12:59,128 --> 00:13:00,546
And you give that information

257
00:13:00,588 --> 00:13:02,297
to your placeable candidates
to prepare them.

258
00:13:02,298 --> 00:13:04,926
I don't know…

259
00:13:04,967 --> 00:13:07,678
We're headhunters, Sumner.

260
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,515
In an economic shit storm.

261
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:12,099
Now I can teach you how to count cards,

262
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,351
but I can't make you do it.

263
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:15,186
So you either reach deep inside

264
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:17,522
and find that small
dark part of yourself

265
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:20,483
that's predatory…
Or there's the door.

266
00:13:24,987 --> 00:13:27,073
Alright.

267
00:13:27,115 --> 00:13:30,535
Try giving yourself a desk name,
something tough, visual.

268
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:33,621
Watch Wall Street,
Godfathers 1 and 2, not 3.

269
00:13:33,663 --> 00:13:36,040
Go on, get your phone, listen in.

270
00:13:39,877 --> 00:13:43,339
Bernadine?

271
00:13:43,381 --> 00:13:45,925
Hey, it's Dane.

272
00:13:45,967 --> 00:13:49,095
How are you, dear?
Is Lou around?

273
00:13:51,137 --> 00:13:53,349
Lou!

274
00:13:53,391 --> 00:13:57,436
Honey, Dane is on the phone!

275
00:14:02,024 --> 00:14:03,985
Hi, Dane!

276
00:14:04,026 --> 00:14:07,238
So, you hear anything from Superior?

277
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,907
Are we gonna get that face-to-face?

278
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:11,659
Uh, I'm afraid not, Lou.

279
00:14:11,701 --> 00:14:14,162
They tell me they went
with the other guy.

280
00:14:14,203 --> 00:14:16,497
Now I told them they were
making a big mistake, but…

281
00:14:16,539 --> 00:14:20,334
I'm sorry, Lou, I didn't get it done.

282
00:14:20,376 --> 00:14:23,462
Don't blame yourself,
we'll get 'em next time.

283
00:14:23,504 --> 00:14:26,340
Lou, I'm bringing in
another person to help.

284
00:14:26,382 --> 00:14:29,468
His name's Sumner Firestone,
he's a great guy.

285
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:32,138
Recruiting savant.

286
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,222
We have any other prospects
on the horizon that look good?

287
00:14:34,223 --> 00:14:36,350
No, not at the moment, Lou.

288
00:14:36,392 --> 00:14:37,935
But we are all over this.

289
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,477
You call me when you
hear something, okay?

290
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:43,149
Will do.

291
00:14:55,453 --> 00:14:58,456
So, how did it go?/ Oh, they uh,

292
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:02,335
they decided to go with
the other candidate, no big deal.

293
00:15:02,376 --> 00:15:06,380
Thank heavens!/ What?

294
00:15:06,422 --> 00:15:09,967
I'm sorry, sweetie,
I know you were interested

295
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,511
in doing this job, but…

296
00:15:12,553 --> 00:15:15,765
I was praying that
we wouldn't have to go to Mobile.

297
00:15:15,806 --> 00:15:18,935
I have no desire to see
a hurricane up close.

298
00:15:18,976 --> 00:15:21,187
Besides,

299
00:15:21,229 --> 00:15:23,940
after 29 years,

300
00:15:23,981 --> 00:15:28,361
I kinda like having you home with me.

301
00:15:28,402 --> 00:15:31,822
Bea, it's been nearly a year.

302
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:34,784
And?

303
00:15:34,825 --> 00:15:37,703
Are you complaining?

304
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,839
Three layoffs in eight months.
Your plant is dying.

305
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:51,509
I can hear the death rattle from here.
And when it does,

306
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:55,179
the only steady job you're gonna
find within a hundred miles

307
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:57,857
of Elkhart won't require
an engineering degree,

308
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:00,943
but a little blue vest and the phrase
"Hi, welcome to Walmart."

309
00:16:00,985 --> 00:16:03,196
What am I missing?

310
00:16:03,237 --> 00:16:04,697
Time kills all deals, Eric.

311
00:16:04,739 --> 00:16:06,449
You're either on that plane
Friday morning

312
00:16:06,491 --> 00:16:08,868
or reading about their new hire
not named Eric on Monday.

313
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,452
When I told him about your opportunity,

314
00:16:10,453 --> 00:16:12,246
he nearly crawled through the phone.

315
00:16:12,288 --> 00:16:14,498
His wife's already looking at homes
and schools in Raleigh.

316
00:16:14,499 --> 00:16:17,376
Now is Friday morning better
for you or afternoon?

317
00:16:17,418 --> 00:16:18,961
He's an excellent surgeon.

318
00:16:19,003 --> 00:16:20,630
He's an excellent plastic surgeon.

319
00:16:20,671 --> 00:16:22,965
The grim reaper is coming
through the cornfield

320
00:16:23,007 --> 00:16:24,342
and he's half Mexican,

321
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,219
half Chinese and
he doesn't take prisoners.

322
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,638
That hole in his resume
is because he's been,

323
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:30,807
he's been off the grid,
he's been, you know, working

324
00:16:30,848 --> 00:16:32,225
with Doctors Without Borders,

325
00:16:32,266 --> 00:16:34,560
he's in the Sudan
sowing up cleft palates.

326
00:16:34,602 --> 00:16:36,562
This is one of the best offers I've seen

327
00:16:36,604 --> 00:16:38,397
before or since a recession

328
00:16:38,439 --> 00:16:42,443
and it ends when I hang up this phone.
Now when can you start?

329
00:16:42,485 --> 00:16:45,071
One week or two?

330
00:16:56,205 --> 00:16:58,334
For Christ sakes, Elise!

331
00:16:58,376 --> 00:17:01,170
It's not battery acid!/
Where the hell did you get

332
00:17:01,212 --> 00:17:04,215
that idea from anyway?
You try it!

333
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:07,969
Believe me, I would if I could.

334
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,636
Well, maybe if I hadn't
already been down there

335
00:17:09,637 --> 00:17:11,722
for forty minutes already.

336
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,140
Well, maybe if you did it more often,

337
00:17:13,141 --> 00:17:15,059
I wouldn't drag it out so long.

338
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:17,927
Maybe if you didn't drag it out so long,

339
00:17:17,969 --> 00:17:19,338
I'd do it more often!

340
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,382
You know, most women appreciate a man

341
00:17:21,423 --> 00:17:23,259
who's not a premature ejaculator.

342
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,303
Sweetheart, when it comes to blowjobs,

343
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:29,181
every woman appreciates a man
who's a premature ejaculator.

344
00:17:29,223 --> 00:17:33,102
Right./ I'm sorry.

345
00:17:33,143 --> 00:17:36,814
I said I'm sorry.
Look, I was fine with it until the end.

346
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:40,943
I just wasn't expecting you
to ask me to do… that.

347
00:17:46,674 --> 00:17:52,454
I don't know, I just wanted to try
something a little different, that's all.

348
00:17:52,496 --> 00:17:56,166
My fault. Should've
pre-coached you on it.

349
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:59,878
Well, I'm not one of your candidates.

350
00:18:04,508 --> 00:18:07,344
I'm just worried about Ryan.

351
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:10,806
He's not himself./ Come on.

352
00:18:10,848 --> 00:18:13,142
There's nothing wrong with that kid

353
00:18:13,183 --> 00:18:16,520
that a little bit of sunshine
and sweat won't cure.

354
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:20,357
I hope so.

355
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:23,527
Isn't this nice?

356
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:27,114
It's hardly ever just
the two of us, no kids,

357
00:18:27,156 --> 00:18:30,534
somebody wanting something.

358
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:33,829
What would be nice is if I could cum.

359
00:18:33,871 --> 00:18:36,123
Dane Jensen.

360
00:18:36,165 --> 00:18:38,792
Last of the romantics.

361
00:18:38,834 --> 00:18:40,668
Don't you ever get tired
of the same old thing?

362
00:18:40,669 --> 00:18:44,715
No. No, I don't think
the same thing is old at all.

363
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,342
I guess you do, though.

364
00:18:46,383 --> 00:18:49,511
What, are you kidding?
It's always the same thing.

365
00:18:49,553 --> 00:18:53,766
Please, not the sex talk./ Yeah.
We have sex once a week,

366
00:18:53,807 --> 00:18:56,769
except during your period,
and a negotiated blowjob

367
00:18:56,810 --> 00:19:00,064
at the beginning of the month.
We're in a rut, Lise.

368
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:02,691
I'm just not as sexual as you are.

369
00:19:02,733 --> 00:19:03,917
Doesn't mean I don't love you.

370
00:19:03,918 --> 00:19:06,403
What a relief, that helps a lot.

371
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:08,530
What do you want, Dane?

372
00:19:08,572 --> 00:19:11,200
Obviously I'm not giving you
what you want.

373
00:19:11,241 --> 00:19:14,578
I don't know, just… more.

374
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:18,123
More? More what?

375
00:19:18,165 --> 00:19:22,586
Don't you ever just stop and think,

376
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:25,130
"Is this it?
Is this all there is?"

377
00:19:25,172 --> 00:19:27,299
I don't just mean sex.

378
00:19:27,341 --> 00:19:30,386
I mean everything.

379
00:19:30,427 --> 00:19:34,098
A bigger house, a bigger job,

380
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:36,725
a bigger… life.

381
00:19:36,767 --> 00:19:39,561
Maybe…

382
00:19:39,603 --> 00:19:43,107
Maybe if we spent more time
together out of the bedroom,

383
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:45,651
we'd spend more time together in it?

384
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:56,620
You can't just ignore me and then

385
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:59,456
expect to have sex.
Foreplay doesn't begin

386
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:03,627
in the bedroom./ Dr. Oz is an idiot.

387
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:06,088
Dane, we never talk anymore.

388
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:09,341
You come home, you're on your cell
or you're sending e-mails.

389
00:20:09,383 --> 00:20:10,759
It's the same thing every weekend,

390
00:20:10,801 --> 00:20:12,119
no wonder every day seems the same.

391
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,555
It's my job, it's what I do.

392
00:20:13,596 --> 00:20:17,767
I remember the first time I got up
the nerve to tell you I loved you.

393
00:20:18,209 --> 00:20:21,228
Do you remember what you said?

394
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,814
"What's not to love?"

395
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:26,358
My God,

396
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,779
you made me laugh! I'd never
met anyone so confident,

397
00:20:30,821 --> 00:20:34,283
so infuriating… so full of energy

398
00:20:34,324 --> 00:20:38,787
and life!/ How do you remember that?

399
00:20:40,748 --> 00:20:43,167
How do you not?

400
00:20:58,474 --> 00:21:01,143
The kids will want to go
as soon as you get home.

401
00:21:01,185 --> 00:21:04,188
Elise, I'll never get home
unless I get back on the phone.

402
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:05,981
Do those look like Witch Fingers?

403
00:21:06,023 --> 00:21:07,900
Yeah! Yummy!

404
00:21:07,941 --> 00:21:09,442
Mom! Trick or treaters!/
Tell them to come back

405
00:21:09,443 --> 00:21:10,819
after it's dark!

406
00:21:10,861 --> 00:21:12,905
Elise?/ There's big kids at the door.

407
00:21:12,946 --> 00:21:15,199
What, like teenagers?
Costumes?

408
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,100
No.

409
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:19,569
Oh God, I hate that./
Elise, I'm hanging up.

410
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:23,982
Ryan said he wants to walk
part of the way with his friends.

411
00:21:24,024 --> 00:21:27,319
Tell them no bones on the lawn./ Elise?

412
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,881
But he wants to start with you
so he doesn't hurt your feelings.

413
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:32,298
Elise, this is a client calling in,

414
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:34,927
I gotta take it.
I'll see you in a bit, okay?

415
00:21:34,968 --> 00:21:36,804
Last day of the month, sunshine.
Whaddaya got?

416
00:21:36,845 --> 00:21:38,406
An offer./ Who and how much?

417
00:21:38,447 --> 00:21:40,899
Fee's 20,000. It's T.G. Duke
out of Raleigh, they make…

418
00:21:40,941 --> 00:21:41,866
Ball joints for the Koreans.

419
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,327
Yeah. My guy's Brian Curtis,

420
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:45,562
he's been downsized,
lives in Jasper, Alabama.

421
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:47,815
The offer is for eighty grand.

422
00:21:49,256 --> 00:21:50,692
Give it to me.

423
00:21:50,734 --> 00:21:54,530
He got another offer on his own.
Hayes Manufacturing in…

424
00:21:54,571 --> 00:21:57,032
Jasper, Alabama.
Christ, why didn't you get him in there?

425
00:21:57,074 --> 00:21:59,076
I'm sorry! He saw an ad in the paper.

426
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:02,329
As in "newspaper"?
You found the one guy in Alabama

427
00:22:02,371 --> 00:22:03,705
that reads a newspaper?

428
00:22:03,747 --> 00:22:05,833
Christ, Sumner,
you'd fuck up a ham sandwich.

429
00:22:05,874 --> 00:22:07,625
He said that his wife wouldn't
have to quit her job

430
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:09,294
if he stayed local./ And?

431
00:22:09,336 --> 00:22:12,130
And he's probably gonna take Hayes.

432
00:22:12,172 --> 00:22:15,092
Probably?

433
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:17,594
He's taking Hayes.

434
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:27,771
This'll be your first deal, won't it?

435
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:29,356
It would have.

436
00:22:29,398 --> 00:22:33,110
Look, Dane, I'm try… doing my best.

437
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:35,237
You think up a desk name yet?

438
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:40,284
Race Bannon.

439
00:22:47,124 --> 00:22:50,619
Send Brian an e-mail,
congratulating him on the job at Hayes.

440
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,997
Encourage him
to get in touch immediately if

441
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,917
his situation should
unexpectedly change.

442
00:22:56,958 --> 00:23:00,879
Then call the client.
Tell them that Brian is excited,

443
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:03,215
grateful, and accepts the position.

444
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,226
Now, get me the name
and home phone number

445
00:23:05,267 --> 00:23:06,769
of the Plant Manager at Hayes.

446
00:23:06,811 --> 00:23:08,611
What are you going…/
But before you do…

447
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:10,798
Hang it./ What?

448
00:23:11,239 --> 00:23:13,742
You heard me.

449
00:23:13,783 --> 00:23:15,877
Put your deal on the board and

450
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,006
ring… the fucking… bell.

451
00:23:19,047 --> 00:23:20,590
Based on what?
What are you gonna do?

452
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:22,968
This deal guarantees

453
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:27,055
that we win the month.
I want that production on today.

454
00:23:27,097 --> 00:23:29,224
Mr. Blackridge will fire me!

455
00:23:29,266 --> 00:23:31,518
I can't roll the dice on twenty grand!

456
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:35,355
Race Bannon would.

457
00:23:36,523 --> 00:23:40,986
Ring it like you own it, Race.

458
00:24:55,936 --> 00:24:58,355
Richard Mercer?

459
00:24:58,397 --> 00:25:02,026
Same Richard Mercer
runs Hayes Manufacturing?

460
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:06,572
Mr. Mercer, this is
Special Agent In Charge Paulson

461
00:25:06,614 --> 00:25:08,782
with the FBI.

462
00:25:08,824 --> 00:25:10,868
Yes, sir, that FBI.

463
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:15,539
This call is in regards
to a Mr. Brian Curtis.

464
00:25:15,581 --> 00:25:19,168
Mr. Mercer, in accordance with
section 25-B of the Patriot Act

465
00:25:19,209 --> 00:25:22,463
we now notify employers
of their responsibilities

466
00:25:22,504 --> 00:25:25,841
and potential liabilities
when convicted sex offenders

467
00:25:25,883 --> 00:25:28,510
change jobs.

468
00:25:28,552 --> 00:25:31,639
Yes, sir, a pedophile.

469
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,141
Well, ignorance of the law
doesn't relieve you

470
00:25:34,183 --> 00:25:36,352
of your legal obligations, sir,

471
00:25:36,393 --> 00:25:40,939
such as posting a sexual
predator notice with his photo

472
00:25:40,981 --> 00:25:43,442
in a high traffic area,

473
00:25:43,484 --> 00:25:46,528
say a cafeteria or lobby.

474
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:48,864
Well, could you maybe
build him a little Quonset hut

475
00:25:48,906 --> 00:25:52,034
or Morton shed, let him
use that as an off…

476
00:25:52,076 --> 00:25:54,995
The cost of shed construction
was not part

477
00:25:55,037 --> 00:25:58,749
of the course work at Quantico.

478
00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:01,293
Well, that's your call,
Mr. Mercer. However…

479
00:26:01,335 --> 00:26:03,712
I should advise you of
the slight risk of a lawsuit

480
00:26:03,754 --> 00:26:06,006
if Mr. Curtis believes
you've discriminated

481
00:26:06,048 --> 00:26:08,550
against him. I'm no lawyer, sir,

482
00:26:08,592 --> 00:26:11,011
but I am the father of two little boys.

483
00:26:11,053 --> 00:26:14,932
Yes, sir, they were boys.

484
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:17,518
A baker's dozen.

485
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:19,437
Well, if you feel that strongly,

486
00:26:19,478 --> 00:26:22,481
my suggestion is that you
notify him that the position

487
00:26:22,523 --> 00:26:23,565
has been filled internally

488
00:26:23,607 --> 00:26:25,693
and forget I called.

489
00:26:27,903 --> 00:26:30,197
Well, you're welcome.

490
00:26:30,239 --> 00:26:32,908
Happy Halloween to you also, sir.

491
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:35,160
God bless you too.

492
00:27:07,818 --> 00:27:10,988
Hey, buddy./ Hey, Dad.

493
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:12,823
In bed a little early, aren't you?

494
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:15,075
Mom said she was tired.

495
00:27:15,117 --> 00:27:18,829
She seem tired?/ Not at all.

496
00:27:24,251 --> 00:27:27,004
Scoot over.

497
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:28,589
Another building, huh?

498
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:31,216
Yeah. It's what I wanna do when I'm big.

499
00:27:31,258 --> 00:27:33,427
Draw skyscrapers and stuff.

500
00:27:33,469 --> 00:27:35,262
Right, right, you wanna be
an architect, huh?

501
00:27:35,304 --> 00:27:38,599
Build buildings?
That's decent money.

502
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,934
Yeah, I just wanna draw them.
I don't even care

503
00:27:40,976 --> 00:27:42,352
how they're built.

504
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:45,397
That's my boy. That's even better money.

505
00:27:45,439 --> 00:27:48,734
I'd like to go to the Art
Institute of Chicago.

506
00:27:48,776 --> 00:27:52,029
Oh yeah? Where'd you hear about that?

507
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:56,909
My art teacher, Miss Jean,
she, um, she went there.

508
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,619
She liked it a lot.

509
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,829
And she's teaching fifth-grade art, huh?

510
00:28:00,871 --> 00:28:03,248
And first, too.

511
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:05,751
Helluva testimonial for the brochure.

512
00:28:05,793 --> 00:28:08,837
She gave me a list
of her five favorite buildings

513
00:28:08,879 --> 00:28:12,257
in Chicago.

514
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:14,092
Hey, where'd you get that bruise, sport?

515
00:28:14,134 --> 00:28:15,385
Where?

516
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:19,848
There./ Hm. I don't know.

517
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:23,769
"The Rookery,

518
00:28:23,811 --> 00:28:26,021
Tribune Tower,

519
00:28:26,063 --> 00:28:28,732
The Pritzker Pavilion, Wrigley Building,

520
00:28:28,774 --> 00:28:30,859
and Thomas Gale House."

521
00:28:30,901 --> 00:28:33,070
Thomas Gale? Hey!

522
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:38,033
Lauren! Stay out of my room!
Get out of my bed!

523
00:28:38,075 --> 00:28:39,450
Lauren, you're knocking all my stuff.

524
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:40,744
Dad, tell her to get out!

525
00:28:40,786 --> 00:28:43,664
Let's not wake your mother up, please.

526
00:28:43,705 --> 00:28:45,582
You missed trick or treating, Daddy.

527
00:28:45,624 --> 00:28:47,876
I know, I'm sorry, sweetie.

528
00:28:47,918 --> 00:28:50,629
I was a kitty cat./ I see that.

529
00:28:50,671 --> 00:28:53,465
Look at you./ What were you tonight?

530
00:28:53,507 --> 00:28:57,553
I was a headhunter./ Ooh! Awesome.

531
00:28:57,594 --> 00:28:59,596
He's kidding you, stupid,
he's always a headhunter.

532
00:28:59,638 --> 00:29:00,973
It's his job.

533
00:29:01,014 --> 00:29:04,268
I'm not stupid! You're stupid!/ Hey!

534
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:07,062
Hey, hey, stop fighting, you two.
Come on…

535
00:29:08,355 --> 00:29:12,651
What do you do when
you're at where you work at?

536
00:29:12,693 --> 00:29:15,946
He helps other dads

537
00:29:15,988 --> 00:29:18,699
get jobs so they can
take care of their families.

538
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,535
Something like that.

539
00:29:21,577 --> 00:29:24,913
Well, that's what Mom said you do.

540
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:29,418
Mommy's mad at you.

541
00:29:57,821 --> 00:30:00,782
That's it?

542
00:30:00,824 --> 00:30:04,036
You just go to sleep?/ Guess not.

543
00:30:04,077 --> 00:30:07,205
You missed Halloween, Dane!/
I know, Elise, I'm sorry,

544
00:30:07,247 --> 00:30:10,208
I couldn't help it.
I had to make a call.

545
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:12,544
You should have seen
the look on the kid's faces.

546
00:30:12,586 --> 00:30:14,880
Guilt doesn't work on me, Elise.
I had to make a call.

547
00:30:14,922 --> 00:30:17,633
A call. A call! You always
have to make a stinking call.

548
00:30:17,674 --> 00:30:20,969
If I was an O.B. would I have
to listen to "a baby, a baby,

549
00:30:21,011 --> 00:30:23,722
you always have to deliver a
stinking baby"? It's what I do.

550
00:30:23,764 --> 00:30:26,350
You think I wanted to miss tonight?

551
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:28,018
That I like making those calls?

552
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,854
I know you like making those calls!

553
00:30:30,896 --> 00:30:33,440
Sometimes I feel like you
don't really live here,

554
00:30:33,482 --> 00:30:34,900
you just sleep here.

555
00:30:34,942 --> 00:30:38,111
Like a favorite song…/ It's sad.

556
00:30:38,153 --> 00:30:41,490
It's just Halloween, Elise.

557
00:30:41,531 --> 00:30:43,742
How sad can a bunch of dressed-up kids

558
00:30:43,784 --> 00:30:45,619
with a bellyful of candy actually be?

559
00:30:45,661 --> 00:30:50,374
Sad for you, Dane.
You're missing it.

560
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:52,626
Even when you're here
you're not really here.

561
00:30:52,668 --> 00:30:56,171
You're always thinking about
some deal you've got going,

562
00:30:56,213 --> 00:30:58,173
or some candidate you're scamming.

563
00:30:58,215 --> 00:31:03,053
One day, you're gonna wish
you had this time back.

564
00:31:03,095 --> 00:31:07,349
I love you and it makes me sad.
For you.

565
00:31:07,391 --> 00:31:10,560
I'm tired, Elise.

566
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:13,480
What do you say we list
my flaws in the morning?

567
00:31:28,412 --> 00:31:31,456
You know, I work damn hard
for this family.

568
00:31:31,498 --> 00:31:34,668
I bust my ass seventy hours
a week in that boiler room

569
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:37,254
to make enough money
so that you can stay at home.

570
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:38,839
And I appreciate…

571
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,589
You think it's easy
working commission sales?

572
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:43,760
Cold calling?
Starting with a blank slate

573
00:31:43,802 --> 00:31:46,596
the first of every month?
Waking up at 2 AM

574
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:50,392
with a knot in my gut hoping
to God I can close a deal?

575
00:31:50,434 --> 00:31:53,937
And all so my family
can have a nice life.

576
00:31:53,979 --> 00:31:56,732
And if that means
missing a fringe holiday

577
00:31:56,773 --> 00:31:59,234
and being the bad guy,
then that's a sacrifice

578
00:31:59,276 --> 00:32:01,278
I'm happy to make!/ Dane…

579
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:06,241
Dane…/ I'm a goddamned American hero.

580
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:13,498
You did not just call yourself
an American hero.

581
00:32:17,085 --> 00:32:20,213
I oversold it, didn't I?

582
00:32:24,217 --> 00:32:27,304
I can't even stay mad at you!

583
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:30,432
You're such an asshole sometimes!

584
00:32:30,474 --> 00:32:34,770
Ow! Sometimes? Whoa!

585
00:32:34,811 --> 00:32:38,523
Get over here, American hero!

586
00:32:45,447 --> 00:32:48,825
Mrs. Jensen, your
pediatrician was correct

587
00:32:48,867 --> 00:32:51,328
to act so expeditiously.

588
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:54,664
Ryan's blood tests show
a platelet level alarmingly low.

589
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:57,667
We need to conduct
blood tests to determine…

590
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:59,085
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute…

591
00:32:59,086 --> 00:33:01,296
Don't you think we might just be

592
00:33:01,338 --> 00:33:04,007
jumping the gun a bit?
My wife brings him in

593
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:06,676
because he's probably got
some bug that he picked up

594
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:09,262
from any one of a hundred kids
and we go straight from that…

595
00:33:09,304 --> 00:33:11,932
To this?

596
00:33:11,973 --> 00:33:14,059
Let's just step back a second, alright?

597
00:33:14,101 --> 00:33:15,727
I wish I had the luxury

598
00:33:15,769 --> 00:33:17,729
of time to step back, to be giving you

599
00:33:17,771 --> 00:33:20,524
the warm and furries. I don't.

600
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:24,903
And, more importantly,
I suspect your son doesn't.

601
00:33:24,945 --> 00:33:27,489
He's probably just…
He's getting fat

602
00:33:27,531 --> 00:33:28,865
because he sits on his ass

603
00:33:28,907 --> 00:33:30,951
playing Assassin's Creed all day.

604
00:33:30,992 --> 00:33:33,703
He's not fat, Mr. Jensen.

605
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:35,872
His spleen is swollen.

606
00:33:35,914 --> 00:33:39,292
What?

607
00:33:39,334 --> 00:33:41,586
My initial examination of Ryan

608
00:33:41,628 --> 00:33:45,549
revealed petechiae and purpura,
which you thought

609
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,968
were bruises.

610
00:33:48,009 --> 00:33:50,595
He complains of chronic fatigue and…

611
00:33:50,637 --> 00:33:54,891
You did not notice those signs?/
"Signs"?

612
00:33:54,933 --> 00:33:57,394
Of what…?

613
00:33:57,435 --> 00:34:00,981
I believe your son has A.L.L.

614
00:34:01,022 --> 00:34:03,441
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.

615
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:12,909
"Believe?"
As in "guessing?"

616
00:34:12,951 --> 00:34:14,953
As in "I don't really know
what he's got?"

617
00:34:14,995 --> 00:34:18,373
"Believe" as in "based on 233 children

618
00:34:18,415 --> 00:34:20,625
I've treated with A.L.L."

619
00:34:20,667 --> 00:34:23,795
You see, the good news is
that it's the most common

620
00:34:23,837 --> 00:34:25,338
form of childhood cancer

621
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,799
and we have a great deal
of experience treating it.

622
00:34:27,841 --> 00:34:30,260
The realistic news is that it gets worse

623
00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:32,846
very quickly if left untreated.

624
00:34:32,888 --> 00:34:36,725
You… believe it's this A.L.L.

625
00:34:36,766 --> 00:34:40,854
but you're not sure, how could you be?

626
00:34:40,896 --> 00:34:44,733
Right? He could be fine?

627
00:34:44,774 --> 00:34:47,402
Whatever his condition, Mrs. Jensen,

628
00:34:47,444 --> 00:34:49,738
he is not fine.

629
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:59,664
Alright, Ryan.

630
00:34:59,706 --> 00:35:03,210
You can hop out now, buddy.
Sorry, hospital policy.

631
00:35:03,251 --> 00:35:05,962
Sure somebody's not using this room?

632
00:35:06,004 --> 00:35:09,174
Oh, my bad. Those are Billy's,
he's not with us anymore.

633
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:14,137
He went home Monday!
He got better in no time,

634
00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:16,306
just like you will, right?

635
00:35:16,348 --> 00:35:20,977
Hey! Look, Rhino, you got your own TV.

636
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:23,688
Better than being at home, huh?/
Yeah, his own TV,

637
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:27,484
private bathroom, and oh!

638
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:30,320
If you push this, you not
only get to control the TV,

639
00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:31,655
but you get your very own

640
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:34,366
room-service button too, huh./ What?

641
00:35:34,407 --> 00:35:37,994
I think I'm gonna have to catch
a little leukemia myself.

642
00:35:40,288 --> 00:35:43,625
Well, I don't know about that,
Dad, but I'm an aide,

643
00:35:43,667 --> 00:35:47,295
so a nurse will be here any sec. You guys
need anything, you just holler at me.

644
00:35:47,337 --> 00:35:48,296
My name's Antoine.

645
00:35:48,338 --> 00:35:49,798
Okay./ Alright?

646
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:52,384
See you later, bud./ Thanks.

647
00:36:09,442 --> 00:36:11,945
Hey, Dad?/ Yeah?

648
00:36:11,987 --> 00:36:14,364
When's Mom coming back?

649
00:36:14,406 --> 00:36:17,158
She'll be back as soon as she
finishes the insurance paperwork

650
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,120
downstairs.

651
00:36:53,153 --> 00:36:55,905
With the insurance that we have now,

652
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:58,491
the cost of my medication alone,

653
00:36:58,533 --> 00:37:03,705
is as much as a car payment.
Your dad, he's…

654
00:37:03,747 --> 00:37:06,791
He's trying so hard, but…

655
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:09,169
I'm very worried.

656
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:12,922
Thank you, sweetheart,
and thank Greg for me,

657
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:16,634
and please make sure you
let him know it's just a loan.

658
00:37:16,676 --> 00:37:20,889
Okay, kiss the grandkids for me.

659
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:25,101
Daddy?/ Yeah?

660
00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:27,354
When will Mommy and Ryan be home?

661
00:37:27,395 --> 00:37:30,315
Oh…

662
00:37:30,357 --> 00:37:34,319
Mommy and Ryan are
staying at the hospital,

663
00:37:34,361 --> 00:37:36,863
but they'll be home soon
when Ryan feels better.

664
00:37:36,905 --> 00:37:39,491
Hm?

665
00:37:39,532 --> 00:37:42,660
Grandma Inez is gonna come
stay with us, though.

666
00:37:42,702 --> 00:37:47,290
You and Nathan will
like that, won't you? Okay.

667
00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:49,542
Alright.

668
00:37:49,584 --> 00:37:52,462
Goodnight, sweetie.

669
00:37:56,091 --> 00:37:59,677
Daddy?/ Yeah?

670
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:03,014
I forgot to brush my teeth.

671
00:38:03,056 --> 00:38:05,600
Let me see 'em.

672
00:38:07,268 --> 00:38:10,855
They're baby teeth.
They're all gonna fall out anyway.

673
00:38:10,897 --> 00:38:14,150
Go to sleep, pumpkin.

674
00:38:41,636 --> 00:38:44,681
Dane Jensen./ Sorry I'm calling so late.

675
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:46,683
Hey, Lou.

676
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:50,103
It's just that I haven't heard
from you or this Firestone fella

677
00:38:50,145 --> 00:38:53,273
in a while.
You know how it is.

678
00:38:53,314 --> 00:38:56,484
Wife's gettin' tired of me
hangin' around the house all the time.

679
00:38:56,526 --> 00:39:00,405
What can I do for you, Lou?/ Well,

680
00:39:00,447 --> 00:39:03,658
if you come across any entry
level engineer openings,

681
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,994
I'd like to hear about it.

682
00:39:06,035 --> 00:39:08,204
You know, maybe we can
both make some money.

683
00:39:08,246 --> 00:39:10,790
Companies don't pay us to recruit

684
00:39:10,832 --> 00:39:12,542
for entry level engineers.

685
00:39:14,461 --> 00:39:16,921
I'm sorry, man. I've been having
some personal problems.

686
00:39:16,963 --> 00:39:18,755
What do you say we pick
this up in the morning?

687
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:20,383
Everything alright?

688
00:39:20,425 --> 00:39:23,052
Yeah, yeah… family issues.
I'll figure it out.

689
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:26,764
Wanna talk about it?/
Do I want to talk about it?

690
00:39:26,806 --> 00:39:31,561
Dane, I've got three kids,
two daughters and a son.

691
00:39:31,603 --> 00:39:34,189
They're all grown-up now,
but they were a handful.

692
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:36,691
Two grandkids. I've been married

693
00:39:36,733 --> 00:39:39,068
29 years, and it hasn't always
been a walk in the park.

694
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:43,531
Maybe I can help./ Ah, it's okay, Lou.

695
00:39:43,573 --> 00:39:46,743
I'm handling it.
I'll corral Sumner,

696
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:49,746
and he'll be back in the hunt
first thing in the AM, okay?

697
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:53,082
You take your time,
do what you gotta do.

698
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:57,253
Don't worry about me.
It's all good here. But, Dane?

699
00:39:57,295 --> 00:40:00,423
Yeah?/ Remember something…

700
00:40:00,465 --> 00:40:04,844
Every family has its issues.
But you only have one family.

701
00:40:04,886 --> 00:40:08,598
Like it, Lou. Like it.

702
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,893
Take care.

703
00:40:11,935 --> 00:40:14,437
You too.

704
00:40:34,082 --> 00:40:37,544
Ryan, look who's here!/ Hey, Dad.

705
00:40:37,585 --> 00:40:41,047
Rhino, how you doing, buddy?

706
00:40:41,089 --> 00:40:44,801
Fine.

707
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:47,470
He's almost asleep.
This is when you show up?

708
00:40:47,512 --> 00:40:51,224
Dr. Singh was in earlier./ And?

709
00:40:51,266 --> 00:40:54,269
And I need you here to help ask

710
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:55,937
the questions I don't always know which

711
00:40:55,979 --> 00:40:58,372
questions to ask him./
Alright, alright, calm down.

712
00:40:58,413 --> 00:40:59,816
I'm gonna go get something to eat.

713
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:01,609
You'll be here a while?

714
00:41:01,651 --> 00:41:03,778
Yeah. Where else would I be, Elise?

715
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:06,781
I'll be right back, baby.

716
00:41:06,823 --> 00:41:08,575
Okay, Mom.

717
00:41:19,711 --> 00:41:22,005
She gone?

718
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:25,717
Yeah. Yeah, she's gone.

719
00:41:25,758 --> 00:41:28,344
She stares at me all day.

720
00:41:28,386 --> 00:41:31,639
Like one of those vultures
on Animal Planet.

721
00:41:36,936 --> 00:41:39,522
She's scared.

722
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:51,951
Yes, sweetie, well, I'm doing
the best that I can, okay?

723
00:41:51,993 --> 00:41:55,246
Then tell him, just tell him
I'm gonna be there for lunch.

724
00:41:55,288 --> 00:41:58,625
Yes, Lise, I'm leaving now.

725
00:41:58,666 --> 00:42:01,669
Okay, I'll see you then. Bye.

726
00:42:04,714 --> 00:42:07,425
Yup./ Mr. Jensen?

727
00:42:07,467 --> 00:42:11,721
I have Mr. Blackridge for you.

728
00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:14,641
Put him through.

729
00:42:14,682 --> 00:42:16,643
Hey! How's Prague?

730
00:42:16,684 --> 00:42:20,313
Give me the number, fucknuts./
Just north of one-fifty.

731
00:42:20,355 --> 00:42:23,524
Halfway through the month?
Christ, Jensen.

732
00:42:23,566 --> 00:42:27,695
Is Wilson at her desk or is she
moving her shit into my office?

733
00:42:27,737 --> 00:42:31,199
Kafka was right. Prague just
won't seem to let me go.

734
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:34,994
Tell me about Ryan./ He's much improved.

735
00:42:35,036 --> 00:42:38,665
Should I be worried?/ No. No, he's…

736
00:42:38,706 --> 00:42:41,918
Put Wilson on. I want to make
sure she mailed Bob a copy

737
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:43,878
of his non-compete.

738
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:50,760
Hey. I got Ed for you.

739
00:42:50,802 --> 00:42:53,054
I checked on your Dr. Singh.

740
00:42:53,096 --> 00:42:55,723
He's a heavy hitter, one of the best.

741
00:42:55,765 --> 00:42:57,183
Thanks, Lynn.

742
00:42:57,225 --> 00:42:58,893
I got you an early Christmas present.

743
00:42:58,935 --> 00:43:01,062
In your "throw-down" drawer.

744
00:43:09,487 --> 00:43:12,448
I'm about to shove November
straight up your ass.

745
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:17,954
Wish I'd done that.

746
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:20,873
Which one of you meat-eaters

747
00:43:20,915 --> 00:43:23,501
is getting an interview today!? Come on!

748
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:34,095
Mr. Jensen.

749
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:37,306
What's up, doc?

750
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:40,017
I've heard that before.

751
00:43:40,059 --> 00:43:42,395
You're here late.

752
00:43:42,437 --> 00:43:46,315
I spoke with your wife earlier.

753
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:49,110
Your son's initial response to chemo is

754
00:43:49,152 --> 00:43:51,612
less than encouraging.

755
00:43:51,654 --> 00:43:53,448
Meaning what?

756
00:43:53,489 --> 00:43:56,075
We should discuss options
still available to us…

757
00:43:56,117 --> 00:43:58,619
Still available? "Still"?

758
00:43:58,661 --> 00:44:01,998
Gene therapy. Using viruses

759
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:04,959
to alter Ryan's T cells
and attack the cancer.

760
00:44:05,001 --> 00:44:08,004
I've had excellent success
in a handful of cases

761
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:10,256
using measles, the common cold…

762
00:44:10,298 --> 00:44:13,926
You want to treat Ryan's cancer

763
00:44:13,968 --> 00:44:17,305
with, what… measles?

764
00:44:17,346 --> 00:44:20,475
HIV. An engineered form.

765
00:44:20,516 --> 00:44:25,313
We're not in some
third world country, no offense.

766
00:44:25,354 --> 00:44:29,901
This is Chicago.
We're in a state-of-the-art hospital!

767
00:44:29,942 --> 00:44:32,153
What do we need to do to

768
00:44:32,195 --> 00:44:35,615
in the realm of non-bat shit
treatments-to turn this around?

769
00:44:35,656 --> 00:44:39,494
Cancer is not a negotiation, Mr. Jensen.

770
00:44:41,329 --> 00:44:43,915
Goodnight.

771
00:45:18,491 --> 00:45:22,036
So, focus on his multiplication tables.

772
00:45:22,078 --> 00:45:24,831
Try and make a game out of it./ Okay.

773
00:45:24,872 --> 00:45:27,792
Ryan knows what to do
with these worksheets.

774
00:45:27,834 --> 00:45:32,004
Shh, shh, shh! Quiet study.

775
00:45:32,046 --> 00:45:34,173
Here we go.

776
00:45:34,215 --> 00:45:36,843
When you…

777
00:45:36,884 --> 00:45:39,887
If you need more, I can always

778
00:45:39,929 --> 00:45:41,889
send them home with Lauren.

779
00:45:44,892 --> 00:45:47,436
This is from all of us.

780
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:50,189
Thank you. Okay.

781
00:45:50,231 --> 00:45:52,400
Okay, sweetheart.

782
00:45:57,321 --> 00:46:00,908
Okay. Let's talk about
the Continental Congress.

783
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:03,870
Who can tell me
what that is?/ Excuse me.

784
00:46:03,911 --> 00:46:06,956
Whose paper towels are those?

785
00:46:06,998 --> 00:46:08,958
They belong to the class…

786
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,837
Could we maybe put them someplace else?

787
00:46:12,879 --> 00:46:14,714
Mrs. Jensen, they're just…

788
00:46:14,755 --> 00:46:17,550
I know that the kids
need Kleenex, I just

789
00:46:17,592 --> 00:46:21,304
don't think they need
to be on Ryan's desk.

790
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:26,183
Mrs. Jensen, no one's using the desk.

791
00:46:26,225 --> 00:46:28,477
Uh, sweetie, do you have room
in your own desk for these?

792
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:31,856
Hey, give me that./ Uh…

793
00:46:32,982 --> 00:46:36,402
Take it easy, lady! Geez!

794
00:46:36,444 --> 00:46:38,988
Keep your shit off my kid's desk!

795
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:53,836
Okay.

796
00:47:47,223 --> 00:47:48,557
Good to go, little man.

797
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:51,852
What's going on?
Where's he going?

798
00:47:51,894 --> 00:47:54,939
209, South LaSalle.

799
00:48:08,577 --> 00:48:11,038
Come on,

800
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:14,125
let's get you inside.

801
00:48:14,166 --> 00:48:16,752
"Completed in 1888,

802
00:48:16,794 --> 00:48:20,423
"the Rookery was designed
by architects Burnham and Root.

803
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:24,218
It's the oldest high-rise
still standing in Chicago."

804
00:48:31,183 --> 00:48:34,353
Dane Jensen. Wyatt!

805
00:48:34,395 --> 00:48:36,897
Talk to me, babe.

806
00:48:36,939 --> 00:48:39,191
Sure they've got problems at the plant,

807
00:48:39,233 --> 00:48:41,109
is there a manufacturing company
in America that doesn't?

808
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:42,194
Dad?

809
00:48:42,236 --> 00:48:45,448
Wyatt? Yeah, hold on a sec.

810
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:48,743
Thanks. What's up, buddy?/
Daniel Burnham?

811
00:48:48,784 --> 00:48:52,455
One of the guys who designed
this place? He said this,

812
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:55,833
"Make no little plans,

813
00:48:55,875 --> 00:48:59,086
they have no magic to stir men's blood."

814
00:48:59,128 --> 00:49:01,756
Cool.

815
00:49:01,797 --> 00:49:04,842
Stir men's blood!

816
00:49:06,761 --> 00:49:10,431
Wyatt? Yeah, listen…
Yeah, I was having lunch

817
00:49:10,473 --> 00:49:14,810
one day in Talladega with
Richard Petty when… yeah,

818
00:49:14,852 --> 00:49:18,981
that Richard Petty.
Anyway, King Richard says to me…

819
00:49:19,023 --> 00:49:21,400
"Make no little plans, Dane,

820
00:49:21,442 --> 00:49:24,904
for they have no magic
to stir the blood."

821
00:49:24,945 --> 00:49:26,697
Well, I'll tell you what it means.

822
00:49:26,739 --> 00:49:28,908
It means if you want to continue

823
00:49:28,949 --> 00:49:32,995
to work a safe comfortable job,
then by all means stay at Rycon.

824
00:49:33,037 --> 00:49:35,039
But if you want a challenging position,

825
00:49:35,081 --> 00:49:37,208
one that will not only
define your career,

826
00:49:37,249 --> 00:49:40,586
but define you as a leader
of men, then this…

827
00:49:40,628 --> 00:49:43,881
This… is your chance!

828
00:49:43,923 --> 00:49:47,093
Well, of course if the money's right.

829
00:49:47,134 --> 00:49:50,054
Forget who you're talking to?

830
00:49:55,434 --> 00:49:57,645
Wyatt?

831
00:49:57,686 --> 00:50:00,648
I'll call you back.

832
00:51:10,593 --> 00:51:14,930
Mmm! Mom, I think our boy's
doing 100% better today.

833
00:51:14,972 --> 00:51:17,474
Some days are good, some days
are bad, but today…

834
00:51:17,516 --> 00:51:19,268
Is a good day.

835
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:21,896
That's right. So, did they
bring your lunch up for you yet?

836
00:51:21,937 --> 00:51:23,856
Uh, no.
My dad's coming.

837
00:51:23,898 --> 00:51:25,274
Okay.

838
00:51:25,316 --> 00:51:26,608
I asked him if we could go somewhere.

839
00:51:26,609 --> 00:51:29,987
Nice./ Did you want to come, Mom?

840
00:51:30,029 --> 00:51:32,865
No. No, Nathan needs to see his mother.

841
00:51:32,907 --> 00:51:35,242
Besides, it's you and your dad's thing.

842
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:40,539
Are you gonna be okay if I get going?

843
00:51:40,581 --> 00:51:41,957
Your dad will be here any minute.

844
00:51:41,999 --> 00:51:44,919
Sure.

845
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,756
Do you know how much I love you?

846
00:51:50,925 --> 00:51:53,510
My first baby.

847
00:51:53,552 --> 00:51:55,846
You made me a mother.

848
00:51:55,888 --> 00:51:58,265
You taught me how to be a mom

849
00:51:58,307 --> 00:52:01,018
to Lauren and Nate./ I'll be okay, Mom.

850
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:03,437
What?

851
00:52:03,479 --> 00:52:05,606
Of course you will!

852
00:52:05,648 --> 00:52:10,277
Silly.

853
00:52:13,822 --> 00:52:16,992
Have fun.

854
00:52:59,326 --> 00:53:02,621
You closing a deal without me?

855
00:53:02,663 --> 00:53:05,332
Huh? Michigan Avenue ain't coming to us.

856
00:53:14,008 --> 00:53:15,968
"The Tribune Tower,

857
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:18,345
"designed in 1922

858
00:53:18,387 --> 00:53:20,681
by Howells and Hood."

859
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:25,811
Huh. Listen, Rhino,
"More than 100 rock fragments

860
00:53:25,853 --> 00:53:28,522
from famous sites around
the world are embedded

861
00:53:28,564 --> 00:53:30,107
into the walls of the Tower."

862
00:53:30,149 --> 00:53:32,151
Look! The Alamo.

863
00:53:32,192 --> 00:53:35,112
Look, Edinburgh castle…

864
00:53:35,154 --> 00:53:39,033
Taj Mahal…
Great Wall of China? Are you kidding me?

865
00:53:42,077 --> 00:53:45,164
Is that one from
that building in New York?

866
00:53:45,205 --> 00:53:49,418
Sure enough.

867
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:52,546
Where were we when that happened?

868
00:53:52,588 --> 00:53:55,716
We?

869
00:53:55,758 --> 00:53:58,969
You weren't even born yet.

870
00:54:01,221 --> 00:54:03,974
Someone heard a plane
hit the Trade Center.

871
00:54:04,016 --> 00:54:06,810
We thought it was an accident.

872
00:54:06,852 --> 00:54:09,813
Until the second one.

873
00:54:11,732 --> 00:54:14,318
We all stood and watched
on a TV in the conference room

874
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,695
as the towers fell.

875
00:54:16,737 --> 00:54:18,697
Were you sad?

876
00:54:18,739 --> 00:54:22,201
For the people in the buildings, yeah.

877
00:54:22,242 --> 00:54:23,869
For little boys like you…

878
00:54:23,911 --> 00:54:26,413
who wouldn't see their
moms and dads again.

879
00:55:02,950 --> 00:55:07,079
Do you have to go back to work now?

880
00:55:07,121 --> 00:55:11,500
Yeah… I do.

881
00:55:22,636 --> 00:55:26,807
Okay, last but not least.

882
00:55:26,849 --> 00:55:29,852
So nice. Oh, wait, wait. Hold on.

883
00:55:29,893 --> 00:55:32,980
I thought it would be nice
if we went around the table

884
00:55:33,021 --> 00:55:34,815
and everyone could say something

885
00:55:34,857 --> 00:55:36,567
that they're thankful for.

886
00:55:36,608 --> 00:55:39,236
Oh, that's a great idea./
You know, it's Dane's house.

887
00:55:39,278 --> 00:55:41,822
Why don't you go first?/ Yeah.

888
00:55:43,490 --> 00:55:46,785
Well, I'm, uh,

889
00:55:46,827 --> 00:55:51,039
thankful for…

890
00:55:54,001 --> 00:55:56,670
Excuse me.

891
00:55:59,506 --> 00:56:03,302
What a cornholing.
Wow, is she reaming your ass.

892
00:56:03,343 --> 00:56:06,722
How much more you gonna
put on for the month?

893
00:56:06,763 --> 00:56:09,725
I've probably got another fifteen.

894
00:56:09,766 --> 00:56:11,560
You don't want the job? That it?

895
00:56:11,602 --> 00:56:13,770
Yes, yes, I want the job, Ed.

896
00:56:13,812 --> 00:56:16,732
You like working a desk then./
No, I don't.

897
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:19,526
You've got roughly four weeks.
Fond of you or not,

898
00:56:19,568 --> 00:56:21,987
I'm voting with my wallet, we clear?

899
00:56:22,029 --> 00:56:23,864
Yeah.

900
00:56:27,493 --> 00:56:31,622
How's our boy?/ He's good.

901
00:56:31,663 --> 00:56:34,625
Thanksgiving?/ Uneventful.

902
00:56:34,666 --> 00:56:38,587
Why didn't you ever marry, Ed?

903
00:56:38,629 --> 00:56:42,174
Have kids, do the whole family thing?

904
00:56:42,216 --> 00:56:45,886
I know me. I know I'm
the most interesting person

905
00:56:45,928 --> 00:56:47,513
you've ever met.

906
00:56:47,554 --> 00:56:50,182
And the most selfish.
I only want what I want.

907
00:56:50,224 --> 00:56:54,144
Ever regret it?/ You mean like

908
00:56:54,186 --> 00:56:56,772
when it's Thanksgiving
and I'm here at the office…

909
00:56:56,813 --> 00:56:58,482
talking with fucknuts…

910
00:56:58,524 --> 00:57:01,443
instead of being surrounded
by people who give a shit?

911
00:57:01,485 --> 00:57:05,239
Yeah, maybe… But then again,

912
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:08,116
you're not flying to Manhattan

913
00:57:08,158 --> 00:57:11,537
with a $5,000-a-night Brazilian
who's gonna turn your suite

914
00:57:11,578 --> 00:57:14,248
at the Carlyle into
a sexual Slip 'n Slide.

915
00:57:16,041 --> 00:57:18,669
See ya on Monday, kid.

916
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:32,599
I had to take it… Ed.

917
00:57:32,641 --> 00:57:34,476
No, you didn't.
It's Thanksgiving.

918
00:57:34,518 --> 00:57:35,811
To Ed it's Thursday.

919
00:57:35,852 --> 00:57:38,939
To you it's Thursday!

920
00:57:38,981 --> 00:57:42,693
We're your family, Dane!
Those people in that room! Not Ed!

921
00:57:42,734 --> 00:57:45,195
This is my chance
to get off a desk, Elise.

922
00:57:45,237 --> 00:57:46,697
This is the job…

923
00:57:46,738 --> 00:57:49,741
I am so sick of your
"this is the job" excuse!

924
00:57:49,783 --> 00:57:52,244
Well, fine! You don't want me
to work so much? Great!

925
00:57:52,286 --> 00:57:54,663
After dinner, we'll put
your resume together…

926
00:57:54,705 --> 00:57:55,914
and you go get a job!

927
00:57:55,956 --> 00:57:58,333
Hmm? "Elise Katherine Jensen!

928
00:57:58,375 --> 00:58:01,753
"Ten years' experience
as a stay-at-home mom!

929
00:58:01,795 --> 00:58:05,591
Skilled in potty training,
play dates, and Pinterest!"

930
00:58:05,632 --> 00:58:08,760
Oh yeah, the job market's
just gonna snap you up!

931
00:58:08,802 --> 00:58:11,263
Hey, maybe you can go down
to St. Cecilia's,

932
00:58:11,305 --> 00:58:13,473
see if they'll buy that
"Doctor Mom" bullshit…

933
00:58:13,515 --> 00:58:14,850
and put you on the payroll.

934
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:17,811
Then you can spring
for the cranberry sauce,

935
00:58:17,853 --> 00:58:21,315
or the white quartz
you just had to have,

936
00:58:21,356 --> 00:58:23,317
or the clothes you wear,

937
00:58:23,358 --> 00:58:26,069
or, or the ten grand "loan"

938
00:58:26,111 --> 00:58:27,779
we gave your brother two years ago…

939
00:58:27,821 --> 00:58:30,032
that he seems to have forgotten about.

940
00:58:30,073 --> 00:58:33,452
Hell, Elise, look how lucky we are,
we don't ever have

941
00:58:33,493 --> 00:58:34,995
to tell the kids there's no Santa…

942
00:58:35,037 --> 00:58:37,289
because as long
as I can magically continue

943
00:58:37,331 --> 00:58:39,625
to pull the mortgage out of my ass,

944
00:58:39,666 --> 00:58:41,918
I'm Santa fucking Claus 365 days a year!

945
00:58:54,598 --> 00:58:58,769
I lost the month, Elise.

946
00:58:58,810 --> 00:59:01,521
I took October,

947
00:59:01,563 --> 00:59:04,066
lost November.

948
00:59:04,107 --> 00:59:06,693
Driving around Chicago,
touring buildings

949
00:59:06,735 --> 00:59:09,279
instead of closing deals.

950
00:59:09,321 --> 00:59:12,074
Now I've got December to get Ed's job,

951
00:59:12,115 --> 00:59:17,454
and Christmas to New Year's
is a deal-killing nightmare.

952
00:59:22,084 --> 00:59:25,837
I'm sorry that you think
I've taken you for granted.

953
00:59:28,465 --> 00:59:32,094
I know you work hard for us.

954
00:59:32,135 --> 00:59:35,889
And you're probably right, Dane,

955
00:59:35,931 --> 00:59:39,685
the job that I could find
is not what you or Ed

956
00:59:39,726 --> 00:59:42,396
would consider worthwhile.

957
00:59:42,437 --> 00:59:46,316
My skills are not what anyone

958
00:59:46,358 --> 00:59:49,736
would consider "marketable."

959
00:59:53,657 --> 00:59:57,369
But I know how to prioritize.

960
01:00:19,391 --> 01:00:21,601
You okay over there?

961
01:00:21,643 --> 01:00:23,437
No.

962
01:00:58,430 --> 01:01:02,726
Holy crap./ Words right outta my mouth.

963
01:01:23,288 --> 01:01:28,043
What do we know?/
The designer is Frank Gehry.

964
01:01:28,084 --> 01:01:31,046
The guy also did a museum in Spain,

965
01:01:31,087 --> 01:01:34,591
and he probably did
some other stuff too…

966
01:01:34,633 --> 01:01:38,595
But I do remember a quote of his.

967
01:01:38,637 --> 01:01:42,766
"When everybody else
is ready for the ending,

968
01:01:42,808 --> 01:01:45,101
I'm just ready to begin."

969
01:01:45,143 --> 01:01:49,231
I like Frank.

970
01:01:49,272 --> 01:01:53,276
Me too, buddy.

971
01:01:53,318 --> 01:01:55,987
Hey, Dad?

972
01:01:56,029 --> 01:01:58,698
Yeah?

973
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:02,828
Do you believe in God?

974
01:02:06,832 --> 01:02:10,001
Depends on the month I'm having.

975
01:02:10,043 --> 01:02:12,879
Me too.

976
01:02:19,261 --> 01:02:22,514
Did you have a girlfriend
when you were as old as me?

977
01:02:24,432 --> 01:02:28,353
Why do you ask?

978
01:02:28,395 --> 01:02:32,899
Cause there's this girl
in my class. Her name

979
01:02:32,941 --> 01:02:35,193
is Shawna.

980
01:02:35,235 --> 01:02:39,239
I think she likes me.

981
01:02:41,449 --> 01:02:43,743
Shawna, huh?

982
01:02:43,785 --> 01:02:46,496
Sounds exotic.

983
01:02:50,917 --> 01:02:54,379
He'll get worse before he gets better…

984
01:02:54,421 --> 01:02:55,672
Worse?! How can he…

985
01:02:55,714 --> 01:02:57,549
Ryan's cancer is unusually aggressive.

986
01:02:57,591 --> 01:02:58,758
Virus!/ HIV.

987
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:01,469
He's telling us our boy's going to die.

988
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:03,512
Don't you get it? Jesus, Dane,
what are we going to do?

989
01:03:03,513 --> 01:03:05,348
Cancer is not a negotiation, Mr. Jensen.

990
01:03:08,643 --> 01:03:11,438
No, twenty people lose
their job, it's a layoff.

991
01:03:11,479 --> 01:03:13,189
Just you, it's a termination.

992
01:03:13,231 --> 01:03:15,191
I told you that before the interview.

993
01:03:15,233 --> 01:03:16,776
The top end is 70.

994
01:03:16,818 --> 01:03:19,279
Forty years old,
a wife and three kids…

995
01:03:19,321 --> 01:03:20,906
how do you not pass a drug test?

996
01:03:20,947 --> 01:03:23,199
When I started recruiting
on this, you told me

997
01:03:23,241 --> 01:03:24,700
there were five must-haves for this job.

998
01:03:24,701 --> 01:03:28,121
Your guy has one.
Maybe. I can't justify the fee.

999
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:31,499
It's about three now,

1000
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:33,752
so I expect he'll be back
from his meeting…

1001
01:03:33,793 --> 01:03:36,046
I don't know, maybe five?/
Would you ask Lou

1002
01:03:36,087 --> 01:03:38,340
to call me when he's…

1003
01:03:38,381 --> 01:03:41,134
Uh, what kind of meeting is it?

1004
01:03:41,176 --> 01:03:44,596
He got a call from another
head… from another recruiter.

1005
01:03:44,638 --> 01:03:47,515
It was just last night./ Bernadine?

1006
01:03:47,557 --> 01:03:48,642
Hello?

1007
01:03:48,683 --> 01:03:50,685
Bernadine, hey./ Dane.

1008
01:03:50,727 --> 01:03:54,606
Bernadine? Hello?/ Sumner tells me

1009
01:03:54,648 --> 01:03:56,274
Lou has an interview?
That's wonderful!

1010
01:03:56,316 --> 01:03:58,568
You're not upset?

1011
01:03:58,610 --> 01:04:00,486
Upset? I'll be the first one
to congratulate him,

1012
01:04:00,487 --> 01:04:01,988
no matter how he finds a job.

1013
01:04:02,030 --> 01:04:04,866
You're joking, right?
Listen up, monkeys,

1014
01:04:04,908 --> 01:04:08,495
I need fresh meat to peddle, stat!
Process Engineer.

1015
01:04:08,536 --> 01:04:11,623
Oh, he is very excited, Dane.

1016
01:04:11,665 --> 01:04:14,459
It's an Engineering Manager spot.

1017
01:04:14,501 --> 01:04:18,546
That's fantastic! Scratch that!
Engineering Manager!

1018
01:04:18,588 --> 01:04:21,466
The drive's a little long, but doable.

1019
01:04:21,508 --> 01:04:24,469
Gimme a drive-in, 423 area code!

1020
01:04:24,511 --> 01:04:27,889
But Dane, it means
we wouldn't have to sell.

1021
01:04:27,931 --> 01:04:31,267
I mean, we're just… we're just hoping.

1022
01:04:31,309 --> 01:04:35,188
So am I. You're both
in my family's prayers.

1023
01:04:35,230 --> 01:04:38,024
Bernadine…

1024
01:04:38,066 --> 01:04:41,277
What company is he interviewing with?

1025
01:04:41,319 --> 01:04:43,363
Now, I'm not a pushy man
by nature, Paul,

1026
01:04:43,405 --> 01:04:46,157
ordinarily I don't get this excited

1027
01:04:46,199 --> 01:04:47,867
about a candidate.
But when I told my guy

1028
01:04:47,909 --> 01:04:49,786
that I was going to call you, he went…

1029
01:04:49,828 --> 01:04:53,331
pardon my vulgarity…
Ape shit./ I don't know.

1030
01:04:53,373 --> 01:04:56,793
Degreed engineer, really
mature for such a young man…

1031
01:04:56,835 --> 01:04:59,754
no wife, no kids, easy relo.

1032
01:04:59,796 --> 01:05:03,174
But the best thing is, he knows exactly

1033
01:05:03,216 --> 01:05:04,968
what you guys are trying to do
over there…

1034
01:05:05,010 --> 01:05:06,886
and he wants to be a part of it.

1035
01:05:06,928 --> 01:05:09,889
Now what time tomorrow morning
do you want him to be there?

1036
01:05:09,931 --> 01:05:11,766
I think we might have found
the seasoning…

1037
01:05:11,808 --> 01:05:12,851
we've been looking for.

1038
01:05:12,892 --> 01:05:14,853
Seasoning's good.

1039
01:05:14,894 --> 01:05:18,648
But some clichés are clichés for
a reason. Particularly the one

1040
01:05:18,690 --> 01:05:21,317
about old dogs, new tricks.

1041
01:05:23,570 --> 01:05:26,197
Eight AM sharp, Mr. Cobra.

1042
01:05:41,296 --> 01:05:44,299
Dr. Singh?

1043
01:05:48,928 --> 01:05:53,141
How are you, my friend?/ Tired.

1044
01:05:53,183 --> 01:05:55,685
The T cells we treated

1045
01:05:55,727 --> 01:05:58,646
are fighting the cancer in you.

1046
01:06:00,565 --> 01:06:04,903
Dr. Singh? Your hat…

1047
01:06:04,944 --> 01:06:07,947
Why do you wear it?

1048
01:06:10,075 --> 01:06:13,369
I am a Sikh.

1049
01:06:13,411 --> 01:06:16,956
My turban represents my constant
devotion to my religion.

1050
01:06:19,084 --> 01:06:21,586
What do Sikhs believe?

1051
01:06:24,297 --> 01:06:27,050
It's my experience

1052
01:06:27,092 --> 01:06:30,845
that all religions are
some version of your, uh,

1053
01:06:30,887 --> 01:06:33,348
'what goes around comes around.'

1054
01:06:41,523 --> 01:06:44,943
We believe in the dignity
of everyone regardless

1055
01:06:44,984 --> 01:06:49,280
of race, age, man, woman.

1056
01:06:49,322 --> 01:06:52,242
A devout Sikh would protect

1057
01:06:52,283 --> 01:06:55,245
with his own life the poor and the weak.

1058
01:06:57,163 --> 01:07:00,416
Ryan…

1059
01:07:00,458 --> 01:07:03,920
If I could take your sickness

1060
01:07:03,962 --> 01:07:08,508
on myself and away from you,

1061
01:07:08,550 --> 01:07:10,927
I would.

1062
01:07:24,315 --> 01:07:26,276
Hey, buddy.

1063
01:07:26,317 --> 01:07:28,736
Hey, Dad.

1064
01:07:28,778 --> 01:07:31,447
Are you missing your party?

1065
01:07:33,616 --> 01:07:36,661
Hey, honey, how you feeling?

1066
01:07:36,703 --> 01:07:39,289
I'd like to go somewhere.

1067
01:07:57,182 --> 01:08:01,269
There you go, Rhino,
the Wrigley Building.

1068
01:08:01,311 --> 01:08:04,689
Man, that's a lotta Juicy Fruit.

1069
01:08:04,731 --> 01:08:07,066
What do we know, Dad?

1070
01:08:07,108 --> 01:08:10,528
Let's see what we got.

1071
01:08:12,614 --> 01:08:15,533
It was modeled after
the Seville Cathedral's…

1072
01:08:15,575 --> 01:08:17,660
Giralda Tower in Spain.

1073
01:08:17,702 --> 01:08:20,955
Built in 1921.

1074
01:08:20,997 --> 01:08:26,085
It has 250,000 terracotta tiles on it…

1075
01:08:26,127 --> 01:08:29,505
that's why it's so white.

1076
01:08:29,547 --> 01:08:34,761
That and the 116,000-watt
bulbs pointing at it.

1077
01:08:34,802 --> 01:08:38,306
That clock? The hour hand

1078
01:08:38,348 --> 01:08:42,310
is just over six feet long,
the minute hand nine feet.

1079
01:08:42,352 --> 01:08:46,147
How do you know all that?

1080
01:08:46,189 --> 01:08:50,151
There's a bank on the fourth floor.

1081
01:08:50,193 --> 01:08:52,820
I was a teller there
for a little over a year…

1082
01:08:52,862 --> 01:08:54,155
when I was seventeen.

1083
01:08:54,197 --> 01:08:57,909
You worked in there?/ Mm-hmm.

1084
01:08:57,951 --> 01:09:01,579
Awesome.

1085
01:09:01,621 --> 01:09:04,123
Did I know that?

1086
01:09:08,127 --> 01:09:11,673
It was like going to work in a castle.

1087
01:09:11,714 --> 01:09:15,510
Only seventeen.

1088
01:09:15,551 --> 01:09:20,348
And in such a hurry to be older.

1089
01:09:20,390 --> 01:09:23,434
Get on with my life.

1090
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:32,360
I'm glad we came.

1091
01:09:48,251 --> 01:09:50,878
I can see your eyes

1092
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:55,508
Underneath these bright city lights

1093
01:09:55,550 --> 01:10:01,722
Everything's all right
for a change…

1094
01:10:02,363 --> 01:10:05,143
Last call at the bar, ladies
and gentlemen. Last call.

1095
01:10:15,737 --> 01:10:19,657
You clean up good./ It's the dress.

1096
01:10:19,699 --> 01:10:23,578
Oh yeah, I see it now./ Asshole.

1097
01:10:24,912 --> 01:10:26,664
How's Ryan?

1098
01:10:29,751 --> 01:10:33,212
How long did Ed last?/ About an hour.

1099
01:10:33,254 --> 01:10:35,256
Stretched it out, did he?

1100
01:10:37,675 --> 01:10:40,970
You did an amazing job.
Situation reversed,

1101
01:10:41,012 --> 01:10:44,390
sick child, I don't know…/
Doing an amazing job.

1102
01:10:44,432 --> 01:10:48,227
Doing.

1103
01:10:50,146 --> 01:10:52,815
You're solid, Wilson.

1104
01:10:52,857 --> 01:10:57,403
You don't cut corners,
you do it the right way.

1105
01:10:57,445 --> 01:11:00,198
Wow.

1106
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:03,951
You know, for all your macho BS,

1107
01:11:03,993 --> 01:11:05,787
you're the first person
there every morning

1108
01:11:05,828 --> 01:11:07,622
and the last one to go home.

1109
01:11:07,663 --> 01:11:09,456
You're on the phone
from the minute you get in,

1110
01:11:09,457 --> 01:11:11,667
to the minute you leave.

1111
01:11:11,709 --> 01:11:12,959
You're the biggest producer
at the company

1112
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:14,420
because you're the hardest worker,

1113
01:11:14,462 --> 01:11:16,714
not 'cause any of that
Dixie Mafia nonsense.

1114
01:11:20,426 --> 01:11:23,971
We're not that different, you and I.

1115
01:11:25,890 --> 01:11:28,601
You're so full of shit./
We're very different.

1116
01:11:28,643 --> 01:11:31,604
We're totally different./ Yeah.

1117
01:11:31,646 --> 01:11:34,690
Anyway,

1118
01:11:34,732 --> 01:11:39,654
the month's not over.
I may have a few tricks left.

1119
01:11:41,572 --> 01:11:44,200
No. You don't.

1120
01:11:44,242 --> 01:11:48,204
You're down $20,000 with
ten live interviews on the board.

1121
01:11:48,246 --> 01:11:50,080
Five are wet because
your people are scared of you.

1122
01:11:50,081 --> 01:11:51,874
They're phantoms. I checked.

1123
01:11:51,916 --> 01:11:55,420
That leaves five remaining shots.
Of those, one pays a fee

1124
01:11:55,461 --> 01:11:57,421
that would blow me out of
the water but it's a first interview

1125
01:11:57,422 --> 01:11:58,965
for a VP level position,

1126
01:11:59,006 --> 01:12:01,091
which means it's rolling into next year.
Four shots left.

1127
01:12:01,092 --> 01:12:03,636
Of those, three are interviewing
for the same job.

1128
01:12:03,678 --> 01:12:06,264
Triple coverage, place one,
that's 15,000.

1129
01:12:06,305 --> 01:12:07,681
Which leaves you
with one live interview,

1130
01:12:07,682 --> 01:12:09,684
which, by the way, looks great.

1131
01:12:09,725 --> 01:12:12,353
But the offer is contingent
upon a drug test.

1132
01:12:12,395 --> 01:12:15,648
A drug test he can't pass.
How do I know?

1133
01:12:15,690 --> 01:12:18,276
I heard him tell your guy
about his coke habit

1134
01:12:18,317 --> 01:12:19,610
when I tapped into the call.

1135
01:12:19,652 --> 01:12:23,156
You did what?

1136
01:12:23,197 --> 01:12:26,492
You thought I was going
to rely on the honor system

1137
01:12:26,534 --> 01:12:28,786
with a man who named himself
after a venomous snake

1138
01:12:28,828 --> 01:12:31,414
and keeps a drawer
full of burner phones?

1139
01:12:37,837 --> 01:12:41,340
Merry Christmas, Wilson.

1140
01:12:41,382 --> 01:12:43,968
Go fuck yourself.

1141
01:12:59,984 --> 01:13:03,863
Oh, Ryan, Daddy's here.

1142
01:13:05,239 --> 01:13:08,326
Hey, Rhino.

1143
01:13:08,367 --> 01:13:10,328
Hey…

1144
01:13:10,369 --> 01:13:13,623
You're gonna be all right.

1145
01:13:13,664 --> 01:13:16,417
I promise you.

1146
01:13:16,459 --> 01:13:18,753
You hear me?

1147
01:13:18,794 --> 01:13:23,382
I… I got the Frank Lloyd Wright books.

1148
01:13:23,424 --> 01:13:26,260
And we're gonna go and see
the Thomas Gale House,

1149
01:13:26,302 --> 01:13:29,430
you and me.

1150
01:13:42,818 --> 01:13:44,904
Hi.

1151
01:14:58,936 --> 01:15:01,397
Ryan Jensen's room number, please.

1152
01:15:01,439 --> 01:15:02,523
Are you family, sir?

1153
01:15:02,565 --> 01:15:05,401
Absolutely.

1154
01:15:09,422 --> 01:15:11,616
The ventilator will breathe
for Ryan until such time

1155
01:15:11,657 --> 01:15:13,618
as you decide to stop it.

1156
01:15:13,659 --> 01:15:16,370
Or until he breathes for himself, right?

1157
01:15:16,412 --> 01:15:18,664
Until such time as
he breathes for himself?

1158
01:15:18,706 --> 01:15:21,667
We need to discuss your wishes

1159
01:15:21,709 --> 01:15:24,045
when Ryan codes again.

1160
01:15:24,086 --> 01:15:28,382
When his heart stops./ Correct.

1161
01:15:28,424 --> 01:15:31,761
What's to discuss?
It stops, you start it.

1162
01:15:31,802 --> 01:15:35,473
Ryan is in a coma. He's tired.

1163
01:15:35,514 --> 01:15:38,684
Okay, we got it, thanks.

1164
01:15:52,615 --> 01:15:55,993
Mr. and Mrs. Jensen.
Few things

1165
01:15:56,035 --> 01:15:59,497
are as comforting
for a child as the sound

1166
01:15:59,538 --> 01:16:03,709
of a mother and father's voice.
Perhaps…

1167
01:16:03,751 --> 01:16:07,421
Perhaps you can give Ryan
the chance to heal,

1168
01:16:07,463 --> 01:16:11,592
let the treatment fight the leukemia…

1169
01:16:11,634 --> 01:16:14,428
Please.

1170
01:16:22,978 --> 01:16:26,691
Are you kidding me?
"Sound of a voice"?

1171
01:16:26,732 --> 01:16:29,110
Stop it./ Surrounded by millions

1172
01:16:29,151 --> 01:16:31,946
of dollars' worth
of technology and he says

1173
01:16:31,987 --> 01:16:34,782
"sound of a voice"!/ I said, stop it!

1174
01:16:37,952 --> 01:16:41,539
He's right.

1175
01:16:41,580 --> 01:16:44,667
Kids need their parents, Dane.

1176
01:16:44,709 --> 01:16:47,002
Not just when they're sick.

1177
01:16:50,089 --> 01:16:54,260
Oh, I love Ryan every bit
as much as you do, Elise.

1178
01:16:54,301 --> 01:16:57,680
I know you do.

1179
01:16:57,722 --> 01:16:59,682
I just wish it didn't take him dying

1180
01:16:59,724 --> 01:17:01,016
in order to get your attention.

1181
01:17:01,058 --> 01:17:04,937
That's not fair.

1182
01:17:04,979 --> 01:17:08,733
No, it's not fair.

1183
01:17:08,774 --> 01:17:12,445
But my little boy is dying,

1184
01:17:12,486 --> 01:17:16,407
so I'm not terribly concerned
about what's fair.

1185
01:17:19,410 --> 01:17:21,704
I love you, Dane, but I'll be damned

1186
01:17:21,746 --> 01:17:23,414
if I'm gonna let you keep him hooked up

1187
01:17:23,456 --> 01:17:26,625
to some machine in order
to make up for lost time.

1188
01:18:13,464 --> 01:18:16,592
I'm sorry about Ryan.

1189
01:18:19,386 --> 01:18:22,473
I was with him when
he got his lumbar puncture.

1190
01:18:22,515 --> 01:18:25,810
You know, his spinal tap?

1191
01:18:33,734 --> 01:18:37,321
Anyway, I'm studying for my RN,

1192
01:18:37,363 --> 01:18:41,826
so I try to expose myself
to as many procedures as I can.

1193
01:18:41,867 --> 01:18:45,996
Plus, it helps the kids, right?
When they see a familiar face.

1194
01:18:46,038 --> 01:18:48,874
I keep their mind off
the needle with questions…

1195
01:18:48,916 --> 01:18:52,503
What's Dad do at work,

1196
01:18:52,545 --> 01:18:56,298
what grade they're in,
sport they like to play,

1197
01:18:56,340 --> 01:18:58,759
favorite food,

1198
01:18:58,801 --> 01:19:01,345
just, you know…

1199
01:19:01,387 --> 01:19:03,347
Stuff.

1200
01:19:03,389 --> 01:19:06,100
I'm gonna ask you
another question, Ryan.

1201
01:19:06,141 --> 01:19:08,727
What's your favorite place
in the world, buddy?

1202
01:19:08,769 --> 01:19:10,855
Hmm? Come on, you're doing fine, Ryan.

1203
01:19:10,896 --> 01:19:12,690
What's your favorite place?

1204
01:19:12,731 --> 01:19:15,192
My house./ Your house?

1205
01:19:15,234 --> 01:19:18,612
There's a place on our step
which lets me know

1206
01:19:18,654 --> 01:19:20,698
when Dad's coming up.

1207
01:19:22,491 --> 01:19:25,286
He's the only one big enough
to make the noise.

1208
01:19:25,327 --> 01:19:28,205
He works late a lot.

1209
01:19:28,247 --> 01:19:33,002
But if I leave my light on,
he'll always come in.

1210
01:19:33,043 --> 01:19:35,963
I tell him it's because I like to draw,

1211
01:19:36,005 --> 01:19:38,549
but I really just want to see him.

1212
01:19:38,591 --> 01:19:41,385
When he leaves,

1213
01:19:41,427 --> 01:19:44,388
I can still smell
his cologne for a while.

1214
01:19:44,430 --> 01:19:47,474
It smells like Dad.

1215
01:19:47,516 --> 01:19:49,852
It makes me feel…

1216
01:19:49,894 --> 01:19:52,271
Safe.

1217
01:19:52,313 --> 01:19:56,150
Anyway, I just thought
you'd want to hear it.

1218
01:19:58,152 --> 01:20:01,989
I think I would if my kid
someday thinks I'm a good dad.

1219
01:20:02,031 --> 01:20:04,283
Like yours must.

1220
01:20:09,788 --> 01:20:13,459
Antoine.

1221
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:17,463
My kid ever say what I did?

1222
01:20:17,504 --> 01:20:20,424
For a living?

1223
01:20:22,509 --> 01:20:25,262
Help other dads get jobs

1224
01:20:25,304 --> 01:20:28,641
so they can take care of their families.

1225
01:21:22,069 --> 01:21:25,072
The Thomas Gale House
is important, not only

1226
01:21:25,114 --> 01:21:27,741
because it showcases the earlier
work of Frank Lloyd Wright,

1227
01:21:27,783 --> 01:21:31,036
but it also hints at his
architectural potential.

1228
01:21:31,078 --> 01:21:33,330
Now, Wright designed the home

1229
01:21:33,372 --> 01:21:35,541
just before he left
the firm Adler and Sullivan.

1230
01:21:35,582 --> 01:21:38,210
He didn't leave.

1231
01:21:38,252 --> 01:21:41,755
Sullivan fired him.

1232
01:21:41,797 --> 01:21:42,965
Because of this house.

1233
01:21:43,007 --> 01:21:44,800
Excuse me, sir, can I help you?

1234
01:21:44,842 --> 01:21:48,262
It's a "bootleg."

1235
01:21:48,303 --> 01:21:52,391
Frank designed it
off the books for the Gale Family.

1236
01:21:52,433 --> 01:21:55,644
See, before, Frank was all

1237
01:21:55,686 --> 01:21:59,231
Prairie Style hard lines

1238
01:21:59,273 --> 01:22:02,484
and cold concrete.

1239
01:22:02,526 --> 01:22:05,612
He designed spaces
that let the light in.

1240
01:22:05,654 --> 01:22:09,283
Rooms that opened up,
then wrapped around you.

1241
01:22:09,324 --> 01:22:14,997
Made a family feel protected, safe.

1242
01:22:15,039 --> 01:22:19,209
Like you belonged here
and only here. Home.

1243
01:22:19,251 --> 01:22:22,713
But Frank was also a gambler,
a risk taker, and he knew

1244
01:22:22,755 --> 01:22:24,714
that if he designed this
off the books for the Gale family,

1245
01:22:24,715 --> 01:22:27,259
his boss might find out.

1246
01:22:29,178 --> 01:22:32,264
Yeah, he knew what
goes around comes around.

1247
01:22:34,183 --> 01:22:37,352
But he also knew that
he could create something

1248
01:22:37,394 --> 01:22:40,272
that would live forever.

1249
01:22:40,314 --> 01:22:42,900
Something magical.

1250
01:22:46,403 --> 01:22:50,365
The magic that stirs men's blood.

1251
01:23:02,127 --> 01:23:05,214
Wheeler residence./ Lou, Dane.

1252
01:23:07,132 --> 01:23:10,427
About time you got off your ass
and went back to work, isn't it?

1253
01:23:10,469 --> 01:23:12,638
Christmas is over, buddy.

1254
01:23:12,679 --> 01:23:15,307
We got a week to get you a job
this year. Chop, chop.

1255
01:23:15,349 --> 01:23:17,017
Think of him as a forty-year-old, Jimmy,

1256
01:23:17,059 --> 01:23:19,645
we'll throw in the other
nineteen years free of charge!

1257
01:23:19,686 --> 01:23:21,480
Hold that thought, Jimmy.

1258
01:23:21,522 --> 01:23:25,192
Dane Jensen.
Hey, Toni, thanks for calling back,

1259
01:23:25,234 --> 01:23:28,237
appreciate it.
Yes, Lou Wheeler.

1260
01:23:28,278 --> 01:23:31,698
No, no, no! Don't you get it?
Every other company in the South

1261
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:34,368
is thinking first of the year!
You see him now,

1262
01:23:34,409 --> 01:23:37,579
you take him off the market
before they get a crack at him!

1263
01:23:37,621 --> 01:23:39,498
Now, what time Wednesday
works best for you?

1264
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:40,666
Morning or afternoon?

1265
01:23:40,707 --> 01:23:44,294
Lou? Lou, calm down.

1266
01:23:44,336 --> 01:23:47,256
Tell me, what are you saying
when they ask you,

1267
01:23:47,297 --> 01:23:49,967
"Tell me a little bit about yourself?"

1268
01:23:50,008 --> 01:23:52,177
No, Lou.

1269
01:23:52,219 --> 01:23:55,889
Lou, no, Lou, Lou, stop!

1270
01:23:55,931 --> 01:23:59,810
Christ, brother,
this isn't the biography channel.

1271
01:23:59,852 --> 01:24:02,646
Even I wouldn't hire you.

1272
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:05,440
Alright.

1273
01:24:05,482 --> 01:24:07,693
Okay. Say this.

1274
01:24:09,611 --> 01:24:12,656
Miss Smith… Toni?

1275
01:24:12,698 --> 01:24:17,286
You know, I've been working
a long time, you can see that.

1276
01:24:17,327 --> 01:24:21,206
And all those years, I've seen
a lot of people come and go.

1277
01:24:23,125 --> 01:24:27,254
I've seen people chasing what
they think will make them happy,

1278
01:24:27,296 --> 01:24:31,091
money, titles, whatever.

1279
01:24:31,133 --> 01:24:33,594
But it seems to me,

1280
01:24:33,635 --> 01:24:35,888
if a man, or a woman,

1281
01:24:35,929 --> 01:24:40,017
can be paid an honest wage
for an honest job,

1282
01:24:40,058 --> 01:24:43,312
and if you can look back
at what you've done

1283
01:24:43,353 --> 01:24:47,024
and feel proud,

1284
01:24:47,065 --> 01:24:50,569
well then, you're happy.

1285
01:24:52,487 --> 01:24:55,532
I know I'm running the risk of
sounding a little old fashioned,

1286
01:24:55,574 --> 01:24:58,619
or naive even, but…

1287
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:02,456
I don't think you can
ever be too qualified

1288
01:25:02,497 --> 01:25:05,876
to be happy. Do you?

1289
01:25:05,918 --> 01:25:12,174
No, Lou, I don't.

1290
01:25:12,216 --> 01:25:16,553
So. Tell me a little bit about yourself.

1291
01:25:27,522 --> 01:25:31,151
Dane Jensen./ Dane, Toni. You know,

1292
01:25:31,193 --> 01:25:33,027
I've never seen a tighter race
between two candidates.

1293
01:25:33,028 --> 01:25:34,863
We'd like to make an offer.

1294
01:25:37,574 --> 01:25:39,534
He'll take it.

1295
01:25:39,576 --> 01:25:42,663
Whoa, pardner…
Shouldn't I tell you what it is first?

1296
01:25:42,704 --> 01:25:46,250
Yeah, all right.

1297
01:25:46,291 --> 01:25:49,378
Okay, what, what, what are you thinking?

1298
01:25:49,419 --> 01:25:51,004
Well, we're kicking up the pay grade.

1299
01:25:51,046 --> 01:25:53,465
One hundred grand base
salary, full relo,

1300
01:25:53,507 --> 01:25:56,468
no sign-on bonus. Insurance
to start first day of employment.

1301
01:25:56,510 --> 01:25:58,929
Now, it is New Year's Eve and
I plan to start drinking early.

1302
01:25:58,971 --> 01:26:00,847
My math says your fee's 25,000.

1303
01:26:00,889 --> 01:26:02,641
I need that expense
on this year's budget,

1304
01:26:02,683 --> 01:26:05,769
so what do you say we wrap
this up right now. Is he in or out?

1305
01:26:08,939 --> 01:26:12,609
On behalf of Mr. Wheeler, I accept.

1306
01:26:12,651 --> 01:26:14,945
Mr. Wheeler?
No, no, Dane, look,

1307
01:26:14,987 --> 01:26:17,614
we all loved Lou, but he came in second.

1308
01:26:17,656 --> 01:26:18,906
I'm talking about your other guy.

1309
01:26:18,907 --> 01:26:20,784
Other guy? What other guy?

1310
01:26:20,826 --> 01:26:24,663
Ping. As in pong. You know,
the engineer with the doctorate.

1311
01:26:24,705 --> 01:26:26,373
Ping?

1312
01:26:26,415 --> 01:26:28,458
Ten minutes after I schedule
Lou for an interview,

1313
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:30,961
we get this resume from your
colleague at Blackridge.

1314
01:26:31,003 --> 01:26:34,423
You don't forget a name
like "Race Bannon".

1315
01:26:34,464 --> 01:26:37,592
Just, uh…

1316
01:26:37,634 --> 01:26:41,513
Hang on one sec, Toni.

1317
01:26:41,555 --> 01:26:43,515
Bannon?

1318
01:26:43,557 --> 01:26:46,184
What?

1319
01:26:49,604 --> 01:26:51,731
It doesn't really matter to me
which candidate you hire.

1320
01:26:51,732 --> 01:26:53,525
Good 'cause we're hiring Ping.

1321
01:26:53,567 --> 01:26:57,195
Bannon's my guy, so his deal's my deal.

1322
01:26:57,237 --> 01:26:59,781
I win either way.

1323
01:26:59,823 --> 01:27:01,950
I win.

1324
01:27:01,992 --> 01:27:05,120
What else you got for Lou?

1325
01:27:05,162 --> 01:27:07,247
Position wise? Nothing.

1326
01:27:07,289 --> 01:27:10,834
Plain Jane Engineer, entry level,
temp to hire, anything?

1327
01:27:10,876 --> 01:27:12,919
No, no, and no.

1328
01:27:12,961 --> 01:27:16,548
Look, email me an invoice, Dane,
I gotta run. Happy New Year!

1329
01:27:16,590 --> 01:27:18,342
Wait, who was the better candidate?

1330
01:27:18,383 --> 01:27:19,843
What?

1331
01:27:19,885 --> 01:27:22,387
Who was the best candidate?

1332
01:27:24,306 --> 01:27:27,392
Are you recording this?

1333
01:27:30,395 --> 01:27:34,107
Okay. Fact is,
Lou's the better candidate.

1334
01:27:34,149 --> 01:27:36,610
Now, I can't ask him his age,
but come on…

1335
01:27:36,651 --> 01:27:39,112
How many years does he have
before he calls it a day?

1336
01:27:39,154 --> 01:27:40,781
He's just…

1337
01:27:40,822 --> 01:27:44,743
He's not a good investment.
Between realtor fees,

1338
01:27:44,785 --> 01:27:48,080
closing costs, storage,
relo's gonna run us $40,000,

1339
01:27:48,121 --> 01:27:50,699
temporary living another ten,
and then there's your fee?

1340
01:27:53,001 --> 01:27:55,921
Hire Lou,

1341
01:27:55,962 --> 01:27:58,048
and he's on the house.

1342
01:27:59,966 --> 01:28:02,052
I didn't hear you right.
Say that again?

1343
01:28:02,094 --> 01:28:04,429
You heard right.

1344
01:28:04,471 --> 01:28:08,475
Hire Bannon's guy you pay 25 grand.
Hire Lou? No charge.

1345
01:28:08,517 --> 01:28:10,644
What?

1346
01:28:10,685 --> 01:28:15,273
Why in the world would you
wanna give away 25,000.

1347
01:28:15,315 --> 01:28:18,443
Because he's a good man.

1348
01:28:18,485 --> 01:28:22,322
He has experience no degree can match.

1349
01:28:22,364 --> 01:28:25,700
He's made all the mistakes a guy
half his age hasn't made yet,

1350
01:28:25,742 --> 01:28:29,454
but will, and he's learned
from them all.

1351
01:28:29,496 --> 01:28:33,750
Because he won't lie or pretend
to be something he's not.

1352
01:28:38,964 --> 01:28:42,968
Because everything I need,
I already have.

1353
01:28:43,009 --> 01:28:46,930
And because the price is right, Toni.

1354
01:28:46,972 --> 01:28:51,601
It's a one-time offer,
expires in ten seconds.

1355
01:28:51,643 --> 01:28:53,854
In or out?

1356
01:28:56,815 --> 01:28:59,901
Who was that?

1357
01:29:01,820 --> 01:29:03,905
Lou, what's wrong?

1358
01:29:08,577 --> 01:29:11,121
What would you think
about seeing the grandkids?

1359
01:29:13,039 --> 01:29:15,417
I thought we were gonna wait
until money wasn't so tight.

1360
01:29:15,459 --> 01:29:18,211
I don't mean visiting them,
I mean seeing them.

1361
01:29:18,253 --> 01:29:20,297
Every day, if you want to.

1362
01:29:20,338 --> 01:29:23,508
That was Miss Smith from LOK.

1363
01:29:23,550 --> 01:29:26,052
They're based out in Gainesville.

1364
01:29:26,094 --> 01:29:30,557
That's about, what?
Half an hour away from the kids?

1365
01:29:30,599 --> 01:29:33,310
I'm their new Engineering Manager.

1366
01:29:35,353 --> 01:29:37,731
Gosh!

1367
01:29:37,772 --> 01:29:40,859
Louis William Wheeler,

1368
01:29:40,901 --> 01:29:45,363
I am so proud of you.
Oh gosh, honey.

1369
01:29:45,405 --> 01:29:49,284
Come on now, come on…

1370
01:29:49,326 --> 01:29:52,412
We both knew it was only
a matter of time.

1371
01:29:54,831 --> 01:29:59,336
Well, I have so much packing
to do, and a realtor and…

1372
01:29:59,377 --> 01:30:01,755
Can I call the kids and tell them?

1373
01:30:01,796 --> 01:30:05,634
Yeah! I'm gonna take a shower./ Okay.

1374
01:31:21,042 --> 01:31:23,795
Well, Rhino…

1375
01:31:23,837 --> 01:31:26,798
We did it.

1376
01:31:38,059 --> 01:31:41,229
I don't know what I thought.

1377
01:31:41,271 --> 01:31:44,524
Maybe if I did a good thing,

1378
01:31:44,566 --> 01:31:48,278
something totally out of character,

1379
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:52,032
that it would make a difference.

1380
01:31:52,073 --> 01:31:57,287
And it did, I guess,

1381
01:31:57,329 --> 01:31:59,914
to a man I've never seen.

1382
01:31:59,956 --> 01:32:02,834
Probably never talk to again.

1383
01:32:05,503 --> 01:32:07,547
But I did something today

1384
01:32:07,589 --> 01:32:11,217
that you'd be proud of.

1385
01:32:11,259 --> 01:32:14,554
I mean, I think you'd be proud of me.

1386
01:32:17,641 --> 01:32:20,477
Just like I'm proud of you.

1387
01:32:20,518 --> 01:32:24,856
Something I should have
told you every day…

1388
01:32:24,898 --> 01:32:26,858
I'm proud

1389
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:30,111
of my little man.

1390
01:32:32,030 --> 01:32:35,492
And if you're tired of fighting,

1391
01:32:35,533 --> 01:32:39,371
and… and you need to rest,

1392
01:32:39,412 --> 01:32:43,333
well, then I understand.

1393
01:32:45,251 --> 01:32:47,921
I'll even keep Lauren out of your room.

1394
01:32:51,174 --> 01:32:54,344
Me and your mom…

1395
01:32:54,386 --> 01:32:57,138
we'll be okay…

1396
01:32:57,180 --> 01:33:00,892
We'll be okay.

1397
01:33:20,620 --> 01:33:22,997
Hey, hon.

1398
01:33:23,039 --> 01:33:25,834
How's he doing?

1399
01:33:27,752 --> 01:33:30,505
The same.

1400
01:33:33,967 --> 01:33:36,469
You need to get some rest.

1401
01:33:36,511 --> 01:33:39,597
Let me sit with him for a while.

1402
01:33:39,639 --> 01:33:43,852
My mom's got the kids.
Go home, take a nap.

1403
01:33:43,893 --> 01:33:46,646
Maybe a shower?

1404
01:33:46,688 --> 01:33:49,691
Please?

1405
01:33:52,569 --> 01:33:54,988
I can't.

1406
01:33:55,029 --> 01:33:57,198
I don't wanna be gone if he…

1407
01:33:57,240 --> 01:34:00,952
Dane, if he codes,

1408
01:34:00,994 --> 01:34:04,497
and only if he codes, I'll call you.

1409
01:34:06,583 --> 01:34:09,919
I'm not gonna let him go without you.

1410
01:34:49,417 --> 01:34:52,962
Dane?

1411
01:34:53,004 --> 01:34:54,923
I love you.

1412
01:34:54,964 --> 01:34:58,510
What's not to love?

1413
01:36:34,606 --> 01:36:36,691
You're fired.

1414
01:36:38,610 --> 01:36:41,237
What?

1415
01:36:41,279 --> 01:36:44,365
You can't just fire me.

1416
01:36:44,407 --> 01:36:48,620
My place. I'll fire anybody I want.

1417
01:36:48,661 --> 01:36:53,041
No, I don't mean…
I don't mean you "can't," Ed, I mean…

1418
01:36:53,082 --> 01:36:55,209
Pack up your shit and beat it.

1419
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:02,258
Fired? Why?

1420
01:37:02,300 --> 01:37:06,971
Because I gave away one guy?
Ed, I've billed out millions…

1421
01:37:07,013 --> 01:37:09,015
Wilson won.
She doesn't need you

1422
01:37:09,057 --> 01:37:10,516
second-guessing her.

1423
01:37:10,558 --> 01:37:12,225
And besides, you're not
the same guy anymore.

1424
01:37:12,226 --> 01:37:15,730
I… I am the same guy, Ed…/
No, you are not!

1425
01:37:15,772 --> 01:37:19,150
I don't want to hear it anymore.

1426
01:37:21,235 --> 01:37:25,031
Over. Done. Get out.

1427
01:37:46,886 --> 01:37:49,347
You know, I used to say
a relationship with you

1428
01:37:49,389 --> 01:37:52,892
was based only on the ability
to make you money.

1429
01:37:54,811 --> 01:37:57,188
It just sounded tough.

1430
01:37:57,230 --> 01:38:00,066
I never really believed it.

1431
01:38:00,108 --> 01:38:03,861
Shut the door, please.

1432
01:38:37,020 --> 01:38:41,774
No, no, no, no, no, no…

1433
01:39:24,609 --> 01:39:26,319
Oh, honey!

1434
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:31,074
Dad?

1435
01:39:40,458 --> 01:39:43,628
Rhi… Rhino!

1436
01:39:43,669 --> 01:39:47,215
How you doing?/ Fine.

1437
01:39:54,639 --> 01:39:57,517
Hey./ It's gonna be okay.

1438
01:39:59,435 --> 01:40:01,521
It's gonna be okay.

1439
01:40:12,990 --> 01:40:15,910
Come here.

1440
01:40:34,846 --> 01:40:37,890
How's he doing?

1441
01:40:37,932 --> 01:40:41,227
His counts are still coming up.

1442
01:40:41,269 --> 01:40:44,397
He's good.

1443
01:40:44,438 --> 01:40:48,526
Uh, a messenger brought this
to the house. From Blackridge.

1444
01:40:58,411 --> 01:41:01,205
Here's the thing, Elise.

1445
01:41:01,247 --> 01:41:04,417
I didn't take today,

1446
01:41:04,458 --> 01:41:08,838
or yesterday, or the week off.

1447
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:11,757
I lost my job.

1448
01:41:11,799 --> 01:41:13,843
Ed fired me.

1449
01:41:13,885 --> 01:41:16,888
Oh.

1450
01:41:18,347 --> 01:41:21,058
Thank God!

1451
01:41:44,498 --> 01:41:48,502
What is this?

1452
01:41:54,342 --> 01:41:56,928
Son of a bitch.

1453
01:42:32,004 --> 01:42:36,008
Daddy!/ Jesus, Lauren…!

1454
01:42:36,050 --> 01:42:37,593
Watcha doin'?

1455
01:42:37,635 --> 01:42:40,304
I'm working.
What does it look like I'm doing?

1456
01:42:40,346 --> 01:42:42,390
Doesn't look like you're doing anything.

1457
01:42:42,431 --> 01:42:44,267
I'm making it look easy.

1458
01:42:46,644 --> 01:42:49,230
What?/ Can we sit in your spinny?

1459
01:42:49,272 --> 01:42:51,774
No, you can't sit in my spinny chair.

1460
01:42:51,816 --> 01:42:54,652
Please?

1461
01:42:54,694 --> 01:42:57,655
Okay, come on.

1462
01:43:01,117 --> 01:43:03,744
Getting in?/ I'm too old for that.

1463
01:43:03,786 --> 01:43:07,540
Come on!

1464
01:43:07,581 --> 01:43:11,585
Okay! Scooch over!/ Alright, here we go!

1465
01:43:11,627 --> 01:43:15,965
No!

1466
01:43:16,007 --> 01:43:18,217
Kids, come on, leave your dad alone.

1467
01:43:18,259 --> 01:43:19,859
You gotta get on the bus
in half an hour.

1468
01:43:19,885 --> 01:43:23,306
Come on. Lauren, that hair…

1469
01:43:23,347 --> 01:43:26,559
Do you want the door open or shut?

1470
01:43:26,600 --> 01:43:28,728
Will someone wipe me when I'm done?

1471
01:43:28,769 --> 01:43:29,812
Shut.

1472
01:43:57,256 --> 01:44:00,051
Jensen Group Recruiting, Dane Jensen.

1473
01:44:00,092 --> 01:44:01,593
It's about time you got off your ass…

1474
01:44:01,594 --> 01:44:03,262
and went back to work, isn't it?

1475
01:44:03,304 --> 01:44:05,348
Lou, how you doin'?!

1476
01:44:05,389 --> 01:44:08,059
Oh man, I'm busier than a one-legged man

1477
01:44:08,100 --> 01:44:10,269
in an ass-kicking contest…
and I'm loving it!

1478
01:44:11,937 --> 01:44:15,274
And how about you?
Can't be easy starting over again.

1479
01:44:15,316 --> 01:44:18,652
Oh, I'm… I'm pretty busy.

1480
01:44:18,694 --> 01:44:21,197
Could you be busier?/ Come again?

1481
01:44:21,238 --> 01:44:22,864
Now that I've got
my feet on the ground…

1482
01:44:22,865 --> 01:44:25,242
I've got the go-ahead
to hire some new engineers.

1483
01:44:25,284 --> 01:44:29,080
Engineers?

1484
01:44:29,121 --> 01:44:31,082
Plural?

1485
01:44:31,123 --> 01:44:33,709
Yeah, we're gonna need two
at least to start, maybe three.

1486
01:44:33,751 --> 01:44:36,462
We're flexible on salary.

1487
01:44:36,504 --> 01:44:37,962
And I wouldn't want to talk
to anybody but you, Dane.

1488
01:44:37,963 --> 01:44:40,007
And I never will.

1489
01:44:40,049 --> 01:44:43,761
I appreciate that, Lou. I do.

1490
01:44:43,803 --> 01:44:47,473
And I'm thinking of one name,

1491
01:44:47,515 --> 01:44:51,352
three words, Mohammed Al Farooq.

1492
01:44:51,394 --> 01:44:55,189
Oh, boy./ Hey, Lou…

1493
01:44:55,231 --> 01:44:57,817
You mind if I call you back
in about an hour?

1494
01:44:57,858 --> 01:45:00,528
I've got a daily meeting I can't miss.

1495
01:45:00,569 --> 01:45:01,946
Walnuts?

1496
01:45:01,987 --> 01:45:03,739
Oz says they're his food of choice.

1497
01:45:03,781 --> 01:45:06,033
If you're ever stranded on
a deserted island… walnuts.

1498
01:45:06,075 --> 01:45:09,829
Guess he didn't plan
on being stranded with you.

1499
01:45:16,001 --> 01:45:18,629
You save the receipt for this?

1500
01:45:18,671 --> 01:45:20,089
I think it's here somewhere, why?

1501
01:45:20,131 --> 01:45:21,465
Alright, yeah.

1502
01:45:21,507 --> 01:45:24,468
Tax write-off… business lunch.

1503
01:45:27,596 --> 01:45:30,975
Dane Jensen… husband, father,

1504
01:45:31,016 --> 01:45:32,986
last of the romantics.

1505
01:45:32,987 --> 01:45:42,986
