1
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,354
Maury, listen,
man, l got a kid.

2
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:22,397
l gotta write
some business.

3
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,442
lt's not my fault.
You're talking after the close, Dave,

4
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,653
-you panicked.
-You quit.

5
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:30,197
You quit on half a dozen sits where
there's a deal sitting there.

6
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,907
- Bullshit. Who?
- Long list:

7
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,826
Crocker, Sergeant Saigon
with the shrapnel in his head.

8
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,828
The man was
a writeable deal.

9
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:39,706
Davey, Jesus, what's with you
this morning? You gotta relax.

10
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,751
You should let me
stimulate yourthird eye point.

11
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:43,919
lt'll energize you.

12
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,421
Put that away, all right?
l'm not your guinea pig.

13
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:49,758
You need to get your license before
we discuss you sticking pins in me.

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,636
Needles.

15
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,430
Still need a license.

16
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,558
How do l look?

17
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:59,768
- Good.
- God, l miss her.

18
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:06,233
Just--just keep
your mind on the day. That's all.

19
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:13,031
What?
Aw, come on.

20
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:16,660
Hurry!

21
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:25,294
Dolly. Dolly,
it's Daddy.

22
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,505
Daddy.

23
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,925
Shh.

24
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:34,386
Let's go.
We're late.

25
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:39,683
l love you.

26
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,561
- Me too.
- ''Me too,'' what?

27
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,898
l love you.
What do you think?

28
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:48,984
Honk! Do you know
what ''honk'' means?

29
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:55,073
Korean couple.

30
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:57,910
-What?
- She was a nurse. There you gave up.

31
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:01,788
- lt's like you don't give a shit.
- l give plenty of shit.

32
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:04,041
l don't get my tuition
paid by Monday,

33
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,585
- l gotta sit out the whole semester.
- Says who?

34
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,587
The acupuncture
university.

35
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,506
University.
lt's a school.

36
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,549
What the hell you think
a university is?

37
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,551
To me, it suggests
a big campus,

38
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:19,014
sororities, high jinks,
trees--that sort of thing.

39
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:21,391
-Yeah.
-Your university is on Reseda,

40
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,393
in-between the TJ Maxx
and a Costco.

41
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,854
-Yeah, where's your university, huh?
- l don't need one, man.

42
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:28,023
lt's all in here.

43
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,153
l can't take this
shit anymore.

44
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:36,573
- Hey, let it play.
- This isn't working.

45
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:40,285
Don't take it personally, man,
but l gotta make a living.

46
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,373
You want to
go it alone?

47
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:52,214
You can't do shit without these.
Here, take 'em.

48
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:55,050
No, l don't need your bullshit leads.
Keep yourfucking leads.

49
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:56,927
- Keep the book too, l don't need that.
- Fine.

50
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,929
All l need is a credit
app and a contract.

51
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,223
- Beautiful.
- l learned this business door-to-door,

52
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:04,059
my friend. Cold canvassing.
All l need is my shoes

53
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:06,061
and my mouth.
Could you pull over?

54
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:09,147
-Just drop me off right here.
- Good, fine.

55
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:10,899
What are you doing?

56
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:12,901
- This is here.
- Here means the corner.

57
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,737
You ever drop off
a human being on Earth?

58
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:19,241
- Okay, great.
- No, here's fine. Here's fine, okay?

59
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,745
l'm gonna write
some business.

60
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,914
-Where you gonna go?
- lt's a big world.

61
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:27,749
Yeah, don't eat it.

62
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:31,879
-Asshole. You!
-Asshole!

63
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,188
Hi, l'm Dave Langer
with valley Food Service.

64
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:51,607
l don't know if any
of your neighbors told you about us,

65
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,400
but we're in the area,
and what l'm trying to do

66
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,985
is give away 10 free chickens

67
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,279
with the price of
just one of our meat plans.

68
00:03:57,321 --> 00:04:00,741
Sir, the one monthly amount includes
everything. Okay, no chicken foryou.

69
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,743
Mr. Simmons, hi.

70
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,494
Maurice Burns,
l'm from valley Food Service.

71
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,455
Oh, yeah yeah, come on in.
Come on in.

72
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,457
-Where do you live?
- l don't really feel that--

73
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:10,792
Sherman Oaks, but l don't think that
has anything to do with anything.

74
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,878
Here's what l'm gonna do:
l'm gonna come to your house--

75
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,671
knock knock knock.
You wanna buy some of my crap?

76
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,131
You wanna buy some of my shit?

77
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:18,467
That's okay, sir. l'm sorry for wasting
yourtime. l apologize.

78
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:20,219
Have a good day, sir.
Go fuck yourself.

79
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:23,722
Why don't you cut
your grass?

80
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,807
l'll bet you hate
to shop, Mr. Simmons.

81
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,434
Oh, l sure do.

82
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:29,686
Well, now you won't
have to.

83
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,190
Oh, Madden. See, that's
the best NFL coach ever,

84
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,192
right there.
He's good in the booth,

85
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:39,530
but-- seven AFC Western Division titles.
That's the man.

86
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,114
What are you
talking about?

87
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,867
Madden, that's--
how do you know him?

88
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:46,370
That's my mom.

89
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:49,915
Uh-huh.

90
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:02,553
Hi. Can you
recognize my ''Hi''?

91
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:04,555
ls this Maurice?

92
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,557
Yes yes, this is
still Maurice.

93
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,934
So what's my favorite
redhead doing tonight?

94
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:12,020
l don't know, Maurice.
l've never had red hair.

95
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,689
This is Carol?

96
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:17,359
This is Carolyn, and all my hairs
are brown, if you remember.

97
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:19,862
Oh yes, hi. Jeez, yeah.
No, l remember.

98
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,822
Yeah, we went
to the movie, right?

99
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,824
We watched it at your place.
How are you?

100
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:26,326
Do you really care? Or we could just
hang up the phone right now.

101
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,704
- lf that's what you'd like.
- l would, yes.

102
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:30,747
Then let's do that.

103
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,697
Hi, darling,
how are you?

104
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,782
Dad, did you forget
my birthday?

105
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,410
Of course not.
Did you think l would?

106
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:11,830
- l didn't know.
- l never would.

107
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:13,081
You know what l want?

108
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:15,209
l think l do.
You want to tell me again?

109
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:17,711
-A swing and a slide.
-A swing and a slide.

110
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:21,089
Yep. Here's Mommy.

111
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,719
Don't disappoint
her, Dave.

112
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,721
lt's not good of herto think
of you as a loser.

113
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,431
She doesn't think that.

114
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:32,893
She needs you to be solid.
Do you have any solid left?

115
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:36,188
Renee, l'm doing
my best.

116
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:40,150
lf you can, just get
her something nice.

117
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,575
That would be ourtop
of the line model.

118
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:32,035
lt's 150 bucks.

119
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:34,746
Wood really necessary
in a swinging device?

120
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,207
lt's superior
forthe child.

121
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:39,209
This particular model
is priced way down.

122
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:40,794
lt's the last one
we have left.

123
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:42,671
Yeah, this is probably
the last time you'll

124
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,715
be able to get it
at this low price.

125
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:48,135
You kidding me, man?

126
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:51,180
- Excuse me?
- Trying to pull that shit on me?

127
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,724
- l'm sorry, sir?
- That's your impending event?

128
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:56,476
- My impending event?
-Your impending event, Glenn.

129
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,854
Make it big, man.

130
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:01,190
Grab an issue.
Talk about deforestation.

131
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,233
Trees are being
chopped down all overthe world.

132
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:05,235
You're not gonna find
wood of this caliber

133
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,237
on kids'
recreational equipment.

134
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:36,391
Hey.

135
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:37,976
Hey.

136
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,728
How'd you do?

137
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,855
l got nothing.

138
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:43,690
Yeah, nothing.

139
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:48,320
l'm sorry about before.

140
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:51,740
Nah, forget it.
Water, bridge, under.

141
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:55,494
Under.

142
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,665
Hey hey, look.

143
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:01,750
Look at that.

144
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:05,379
Yeah, cute.
Take it easy.

145
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:07,422
She's too happy
foryou.

146
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:12,469
- How is everything?
- l have two iced teas now.

147
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:15,264
You must be thirsty.

148
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:18,809
Kristy, do you see what l do so we can
spend some time alone together?

149
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,979
And the dish ran away
with the spoon.

150
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,982
lt's been so hard
being apart like this.

151
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,859
l think we need
to see each other more.

152
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:30,279
- That's what l think.
- l think you're nuts.

153
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:41,790
So you wanna help me
steal a swing set?

154
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,836
Not before we try these.

155
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:48,088
All right, so it's all
there in the application.

156
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:49,715
You're gonna get a free delivery,
you're gonna get a free freezer

157
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:52,050
and you're gonna get
10 free filets.

158
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:55,304
Take it.

159
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:59,892
l don't understand
why we need all this meat.

160
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:04,229
l'm sorry. We went overthis.
Andy likes filets.

161
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:05,731
You like the rib eye.

162
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:09,067
This whole order is customized
forthe Wilson family.

163
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:11,153
Sally's been on
this health kick lately.

164
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:14,656
- lt's not a kick.
- Program, honey.

165
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:17,326
She's been eating healthy,
and she wants to keep it up.

166
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,369
Eating healthy
means eating meat in the middle.

167
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:23,123
You make meat the hub.
Let your otherfoods fill in around it.

168
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:25,876
We were made to eat
meat originally by God.

169
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,754
Our inner system works better when
it we give it what it was meant to have.

170
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:32,257
Don't you think it's healthy to have
what God meant foryou to have?

171
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:34,760
l guess so.

172
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:36,803
l guess so too.

173
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:41,433
Take it for
Sally's health.

174
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:43,852
Honey...

175
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:49,191
- Okay, great, good.

176
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:51,902
We'll be back with the freezerfirst
thing in the morning.

177
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:07,584
- l think we turned it around yesterday.
- l think we did.

178
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:16,969
-victory smells good.
- Tastes good.

179
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:19,429
- Mr. Wilson?
- Oh, no, l'm sorry.

180
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:21,557
You can't bring that in here.
And please move yourtruck.

181
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,392
What? No, we're not taking
delivery of this.

182
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:26,395
No no, you taste victory.
You smell success.

183
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,480
- Shit! Fuck! Come on!
- No no!

184
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:30,232
We should have stayed fortea
when she asked us.

185
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:32,609
- No fucking way!
- Hold it.

186
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:37,364
Yeah yeah, no, we're okay.
Just wait right there.

187
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:38,949
We're gonna be okay.

188
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,785
Andy, Sally, you're gonna love it.
lt's a beaut.

189
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:44,246
-We changed our mind.
- No no no, it's okay.

190
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:46,582
Andy and Sally,
we see this all the time.

191
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:50,085
Absolutely, you know, it's-it's-it's
common to feel a little overwhelmed

192
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:52,588
- on a new purchase.
- Sure sure.

193
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:55,924
Change is good!
You know that.

194
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:58,468
Knock back
if you think change is good.

195
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:08,645
Come on, Andy, Sally.
We had an agreement!

196
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:10,647
You go through
leads like water.

197
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:13,442
l think it's time to give it a break.
You boys need a rest.

198
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:15,527
What are you,
a psychiatrist?

199
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:17,529
You could use some time
in Ensenada, Langer.

200
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:19,531
Both of you
probably, apart.

201
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:21,074
- Now you're our social director?
- No, it means we're fired.

202
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:23,118
ls that the expression,
''Go to Ensenada''?

203
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,163
lt's a slump, Dick, okay?
Everybody goes through 'em.

204
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,624
Dick, can't acknowledge a simple
string of bad luck?

205
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:32,294
The word doesn't exist. lf you believe
in luck, you're a schmuck.

206
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:34,296
You used to kill, Maury.
What happened?

207
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:36,840
- Things change, Dick.
- Forget it, Maury.

208
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:38,634
Dick, it's me,
all right?

209
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,636
Just tell my kid l loved her.
l'm gonna go find a ledge.

210
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,804
Don't be so
fucking dramatic.

211
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:44,890
l'll give you something.

212
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:51,980
These are the best
l have today.

213
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:54,733
There's a deal in here,
God damn it, maybe two.

214
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,944
lf you don't
write any business with these,

215
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:58,946
then we gotta
say goodbye.

216
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:01,782
l need closers
who close.

217
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:04,826
Now come on,
you guys are pros.

218
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,454
Don't press,
for Christ's sake.

219
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:10,332
l want you to go eat a good breakfast,
have an extra Danish,

220
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:13,085
then go write
some business.

221
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:21,677
Stay cool, boys.
lt's gonna be a scorcher.

222
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,961
He could be here.
Perfect prospect.

223
00:13:56,044 --> 00:14:00,132
A leaf from God.
l'm ready for him.

224
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:02,467
See, when l think
of that guy,

225
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:04,219
something happens.
Something kicks in.

226
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:07,848
l know. l know.
You get very excited.

227
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,478
- Oh.
- Nice, very nice.

228
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:15,230
very good.

229
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:16,773
- Bye.
- Bye.

230
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,986
She's a very
fast learner.

231
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:23,655
l started teaching her
about three years ago.

232
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:27,367
Now she gives me lessons,
but not piano.

233
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:29,912
l'll tell you something.
With our program,

234
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:33,916
you'll be able to save a sizable portion
of your music teacher salary.

235
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:36,919
lt's the right thing
to do, Leon. Take it.

236
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,422
lt's very attractive, l must say.
Let me think about it.

237
00:14:41,173 --> 00:14:41,757
- Go ahead.
- Think about it.

238
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,717
He wants
to think about it.

239
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,302
Leon.

240
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:48,805
Beethoven-- do you think
he thought to himself,

241
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:52,100
''Hey, should l write...''?

242
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:54,394
No, he wrote it.

243
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:57,981
And thank God he did.
lt's the right thing to do, Leon.

244
00:14:58,065 --> 00:14:59,733
Take it.

245
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:04,321
lf l'm not gonna be a great composer,
at least l can eat well.

246
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,698
Next year l'm gonna
be out to here.

247
00:15:06,782 --> 00:15:08,492
l'll tell you
something else,

248
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:11,829
even if you and that pretty little lady
there decide to tie the knot,

249
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:14,081
we just make
a few adjustments.

250
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:15,666
You too.

251
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:18,752
We talk
about that a lot.

252
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:20,754
l should marry her,
shouldn't l?

253
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:24,383
When l look at her, l can tell she
just wants to be your wife.

254
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:28,428
Fellas, it's a sweet deal,
but l think l should...

255
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:30,597
run it by Karen.

256
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:34,518
When she moves in here,
my fridge is gonna be herfridge.

257
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,520
So why don't you
just leave your card

258
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:39,147
and we'll discuss it?

259
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:43,026
Take it.

260
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:46,780
Hold the pen!
You don't talk.

261
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:50,325
Yeah,
the next move is his.

262
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:52,494
He's only got one move.

263
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:54,496
- He takes the pen.
- He takes the pen, l know.

264
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:56,498
Why didn't you
give me a signal or something?

265
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,250
l don't care.
Give me the finger.

266
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,586
- l shushed you.
-You can't shush me.

267
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:03,505
l'm locked in, l'm not gonna hearthat.
Touch my leg. That's all.

268
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:07,217
Jesus, Davey,
l gotta finish this semester.

269
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:10,429
Then six months
of clinical, l'm a doctor.

270
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:12,097
l-- l know.

271
00:16:12,181 --> 00:16:14,933
My father would
have known that,

272
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:17,477
then... wow.

273
00:16:17,561 --> 00:16:20,814
He'd still be dead, but with a different
expression on his face.

274
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:23,525
He'll know.

275
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:26,945
l don't think he ever
thought of me as a man.

276
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:30,490
You know, my father?
l talk to him,

277
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:33,702
and l tell him,
''Be patient.''

278
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:35,913
lt's not overfor me.

279
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:37,915
And if it's
not overfor me,

280
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:40,709
then in a strange way
it's not overfor him.

281
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:43,253
l'm out there.
l'm looking.

282
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:45,964
Yeah, what are you
looking for?

283
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:49,009
A sign-- something--
that God sees me.

284
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:01,271
Oh, shit.

285
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:03,524
Where's the other
lead card?

286
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:05,609
You have them.

287
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:09,238
What, Davey?
What's going on, Davey?

288
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:10,989
Stop the car!

289
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:13,367
Just find the card!
Find the card that you lost!

290
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,494
Look at all these
hamburger wrappers here!

291
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:17,496
- l told you not to eat this shit.
- Oh, yeah, just me!

292
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,498
- l'm the only one who eats, yeah!
- lt's all you.

293
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:21,041
Oh, bullshit!
We pull up to a drive-through,

294
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:23,669
l order, you just
stare, right? You eat!

295
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:25,838
-Yeah, it's not a religion with me!
-You fucking eat!

296
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:29,258
lt's not like a carnival ride
with me, all right?

297
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:32,386
Gimme the card. Gimme the last card
before you lose this one.

298
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:36,348
- l'm sorry!
- This is it. This is it, Davey.

299
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:38,350
- This is the last one.
- l'm sorry, all right?

300
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:40,477
This is the last card, Davey.
We gotta focus now, all right?

301
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:42,771
-All right? Take it in.
-All right.

302
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:45,274
Feels good. We're good.
Are you good?

303
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:48,443
l'm good.

304
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:53,448
You son of a bitch!
l'll punch your asshole!

305
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:13,135
l'm good.

306
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:15,679
''l'll punch
your asshole''?

307
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:19,099
Got confused.
l wanted to say ''l'll punch you,''

308
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:21,185
and ''You're an asshole.''

309
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:24,438
Yeah.

310
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:26,481
We'll figure it out
on the way.

311
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:12,277
God, please
don't make me beg.

312
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:14,363
Just a minute.

313
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:31,964
Hi.

314
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:35,968
Hi, l'm Maurice Burns.
l'm from valley Food Service.

315
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:39,721
And this is Dave Langer.
He works for me.

316
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:42,558
Yes, you're here.
Come in.

317
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,601
Thank you.

318
00:19:46,395 --> 00:19:49,523
l'm on the telephone.
Afriend of mine is having boy problems,

319
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:52,234
but sit,
l'll be right back.

320
00:19:53,652 --> 00:19:56,822
Salesmen.

321
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:02,161
Holy shit.

322
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:04,830
Nice twigs.
Clean.

323
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:07,791
God in heaven.

324
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:10,252
Maury, put your dick
in a bag and have the bag buried.

325
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:12,588
This is a deal, okay?
Come on, l smell it, okay?

326
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:15,632
And as a point of information,
it smells very good.

327
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:17,926
l'm ready.
l'm ready.

328
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,970
- Be ready, man.
- l'm right here.

329
00:20:20,012 --> 00:20:22,764
- Shut the fuck up. She can hearyou.
- Let's sell some meat.

330
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:27,686
- Shut up. Yeah.
- l've seen beautiful women before.

331
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:30,939
-You'd need a pretty big bag.
- Shut the fuck up!

332
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:32,983
So we can cut your steaks
a half-inch thick,

333
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:35,986
three-quarters of an inch or a full
inch. Which do you prefer?

334
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:39,114
l like variety.

335
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:43,285
l'm gonna start your package
with a 10-lb. box of free filets.

336
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:46,788
The best. lt's just our way of saying
that you're special.

337
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:49,416
- Don't you think?
-What sort of freezer do you have?

338
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,876
Well, just the one
in the--

339
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:52,628
Just a little one
above the refrigerator?

340
00:20:52,711 --> 00:20:55,297
lt's okay. lt's okay.
We can put a unit in the house.

341
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,508
Oh, really? What's a unit?

342
00:21:01,512 --> 00:21:04,806
Excuse me.

343
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:11,563
Okay, this is
going good.

344
00:21:11,647 --> 00:21:14,107
Yeah, smooth.
Just don't rush.

345
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:16,151
Got nowhere
to rush to, okay?

346
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:17,736
- l'm just saying.
- l'm doing fine.

347
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:19,446
Suzy's freaking.

348
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:21,490
l mean, she-- she can't
find the goldfish,

349
00:21:21,532 --> 00:21:23,742
and something is flipping
in her stomach.

350
00:21:23,826 --> 00:21:25,869
l am sorry, but l told herthat
l have a doctor over,

351
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:28,163
that he's friend, and that's you.
Please come with me.

352
00:21:28,205 --> 00:21:31,083
Tell herthat it's okay,
that it's nothing.

353
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,669
Come on.

354
00:21:41,552 --> 00:21:44,847
Suzy, sweetie,
here he is.

355
00:21:46,098 --> 00:21:49,017
Hello, hi,
this is, uh...

356
00:21:50,227 --> 00:21:52,855
Dr. Kissinger.

357
00:21:52,938 --> 00:21:55,899
Can l help you?
Mm-hmm, yeah.

358
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:57,818
Well, you know what?
l-- uh, l see a lot of that,

359
00:21:57,901 --> 00:22:00,571
and it's nothing
to worry about.

360
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:03,740
Uh, the rule we go by
in medicine is

361
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:06,743
if it's a critter of any heft,
you gotta go in after it,

362
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:09,329
but if it's a fish, you just let it
float downstream.

363
00:22:09,413 --> 00:22:12,583
Uh, you can
if you'd like.

364
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:22,176
Hey.
Everything okay?

365
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:24,386
Come with me.

366
00:22:35,606 --> 00:22:40,235
Hi, could you please turn that big heavy
bottle over, Maurice,

367
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:43,155
-while l have you?
-You got it.

368
00:22:43,238 --> 00:22:45,908
See, my nails make
everything impossible.

369
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,126
You like bubbles?

370
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,587
l adore them.

371
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:04,927
Huh?

372
00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:10,641
That was so easy foryou.
You're so strong.

373
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:13,435
You work out?

374
00:23:13,477 --> 00:23:16,855
No, l'm a strong guy.
l don't know why.

375
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:20,359
lt's good genes.

376
00:23:20,442 --> 00:23:23,362
Well, my mother
was a strong woman.

377
00:23:23,445 --> 00:23:26,031
Mine too.

378
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:28,700
Hmm.

379
00:23:28,784 --> 00:23:32,037
You know, we should
be talking business here.

380
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,332
Yeah yeah,
Dave said no flirting,

381
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:38,460
but l think he meant just me.
l mean, you can flirt all you want.

382
00:23:38,502 --> 00:23:42,172
Go ahead. See if you
can get my attention.

383
00:23:42,256 --> 00:23:45,175
Come. Show me
your meat.

384
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:49,596
Your partner seems
to think it's the best in the nation.

385
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,099
lt's true.

386
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:55,269
Well, when you're all better,
you'll go shopping for a new fish.

387
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:56,645
Okay?

388
00:23:56,687 --> 00:23:59,481
Good, now just put
your head down and be calm

389
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:02,776
and resty rest.
Okay. Bye-bye.

390
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:10,742
So of course to pass along
the savings to you,

391
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:12,744
we deliver
to you in quantity.

392
00:24:12,828 --> 00:24:16,290
-You buy a whole side of beef--
-Will you bring it to me?

393
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:19,251
Myself personally?

394
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:22,671
Could you do me a favor
and just check it without the slide?

395
00:24:22,754 --> 00:24:25,507
Yeah, uh-huh.
The same model withou--

396
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:28,927
Could you hold on
one second, please?

397
00:24:29,011 --> 00:24:32,264
Hello? Suzanne.

398
00:24:32,347 --> 00:24:34,683
l thought you were
supposed to be resting.

399
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:37,728
Yes, l am right here.
l'm still here.

400
00:24:37,811 --> 00:24:41,440
Mm-hmm. Okay, what
l want you to do is calm down, okay?

401
00:24:41,523 --> 00:24:44,109
Close your eyes and remember
there are so many things

402
00:24:44,193 --> 00:24:45,986
to dream about.

403
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:51,200
An example would be
anything you like.

404
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:54,661
You like melon.

405
00:24:54,745 --> 00:24:59,416
-You initial there. That's all right.
- Okay.

406
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,085
l don't think that's a good idea, Su--
you gotta calm do--

407
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:04,588
calm down, Su--
Suzanne!

408
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:07,508
-You didn't sign it. Did you sign it?
-Ay.

409
00:25:07,591 --> 00:25:10,802
Hello, you gotta talk to her.
l think she's trying to kill herself.

410
00:25:10,886 --> 00:25:12,012
Again?

411
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:14,723
l'm sorry, but l'm
really not a doctor.

412
00:25:14,765 --> 00:25:16,975
Uh, you just gotta
talk to her.

413
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:19,019
Was about to sign
the fucking check.

414
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:21,313
What am l supposed to do?
l'm not a doctor!

415
00:25:21,396 --> 00:25:23,273
Oh, ju--
oh shit!

416
00:25:23,357 --> 00:25:26,318
Suzanna, no no no, l'll be there.
Don't lock the door!

417
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:28,695
Suzy, no!

418
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:31,740
Suzy cut her wrist.
She says it's not for attention,

419
00:25:31,782 --> 00:25:33,367
but l know it is.

420
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,619
l mean, l have to go.
l have to go and help her.

421
00:25:35,702 --> 00:25:38,497
- l mean, we can meet later, right?
-We can't meet later.

422
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,916
We should take you.
Uh, we'll drive.

423
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:43,585
Okay, all right, let's go.
Let's go. We'll finish with this later.

424
00:25:43,627 --> 00:25:47,589
- No no no. l shouldn't.
- He used to race.

425
00:25:47,631 --> 00:25:49,967
Okay okay, let's go.

426
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:52,469
Close her in the car.

427
00:26:07,276 --> 00:26:09,945
We could finish up
the paperwork now if you wanted to.

428
00:26:09,987 --> 00:26:11,780
Yeah.

429
00:26:11,864 --> 00:26:15,784
Ay, Suzy-- she's like a friend
that l've had since l moved here.

430
00:26:15,826 --> 00:26:20,122
You know, we've got
in trouble so many times together.

431
00:26:20,205 --> 00:26:22,249
She taught me all
the bad words in English.

432
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:25,460
Like, you know,
like ''fuck me'' and ''piece of shit''

433
00:26:25,502 --> 00:26:28,297
and ''motherfucker''
and ''asshole''

434
00:26:28,338 --> 00:26:32,551
and ''cocksucker''
and ''blow me.''

435
00:26:34,011 --> 00:26:36,513
- That's pretty good.
-Yeah.

436
00:26:36,597 --> 00:26:40,559
- lt's good.

437
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:03,916
Suzy, Suzy!

438
00:27:03,999 --> 00:27:06,668
Hey, you guys.
False alarm.

439
00:27:06,752 --> 00:27:11,632
Totally false alarm. l'm doing much
better. Oh, you brought company.

440
00:27:11,715 --> 00:27:15,886
Come in. l'm so embarrassed.
l've been yelling.

441
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:18,222
Did you guys
hear me yelling?

442
00:27:18,305 --> 00:27:22,601
l can fly off
the handle, l admit.

443
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:24,770
Oh, wait wait.
Look, you guys.

444
00:27:24,853 --> 00:27:26,647
Look look, watch.

445
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:30,234
Check it out, watch.
Ta-da!

446
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:33,904
l didn't even take
one class of nursing.

447
00:27:33,987 --> 00:27:36,073
l could totally
be a nurse.

448
00:27:36,156 --> 00:27:39,368
Ay, amiga, let me see.
What did you do?

449
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:41,370
Loridonna,
l didn't even bleed.

450
00:27:41,411 --> 00:27:44,206
lt's like... nothing.

451
00:27:51,004 --> 00:27:52,798
Are you guys here
to kill me?

452
00:27:52,881 --> 00:27:55,342
Ay no, Suzy, no.

453
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:58,011
That's the good doctor.

454
00:27:58,095 --> 00:28:01,640
Oh my God.

455
00:28:01,723 --> 00:28:05,352
Kissinger.
You--you--

456
00:28:05,435 --> 00:28:06,728
That's me.

457
00:28:06,812 --> 00:28:08,772
You...

458
00:28:08,814 --> 00:28:10,816
You look weird.

459
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:13,944
Okay.

460
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:17,281
- Do you think l did the right thing?
-Ay, Suzy, please.

461
00:28:17,364 --> 00:28:20,075
l don't know.

462
00:28:20,117 --> 00:28:22,828
l think, uh, you drank a lot.
Don't you?

463
00:28:22,911 --> 00:28:25,289
- No, ljust--
-Yes.

464
00:28:25,372 --> 00:28:28,542
l had like
just a little drink,

465
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:30,752
and l can't
believe you came.

466
00:28:30,836 --> 00:28:34,840
You are such a good friend and you
brought--yay-- people.

467
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:40,637
-We're in the middle of this thing.
- Let's just get the fuck

468
00:28:40,721 --> 00:28:42,639
- out of here.
- No no no.

469
00:28:42,723 --> 00:28:44,892
She'll calm her down
and then we'll sign her.

470
00:28:44,975 --> 00:28:47,019
l can't! l can't!

471
00:28:47,102 --> 00:28:51,106
Just go. Go in there and occupy her
and send Loridonna to me.

472
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,566
- No way, no.
-What? Tell me why.

473
00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:54,568
Maury, because
this is business.

474
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:55,944
Well, l know
this is business.

475
00:28:56,028 --> 00:28:59,698
The doctor--
she wants the doctor.

476
00:28:59,781 --> 00:29:01,617
She wants the doctor.

477
00:29:01,658 --> 00:29:04,286
Just--
Dave, we're good.

478
00:29:06,038 --> 00:29:08,290
l'll be
in the kitchen.

479
00:29:25,682 --> 00:29:29,144
l think yourfriend has
everything under control.

480
00:29:29,186 --> 00:29:31,438
Oh.

481
00:29:31,522 --> 00:29:33,565
Yeah.

482
00:29:33,649 --> 00:29:35,943
Dave's very good
under pressure.

483
00:29:36,026 --> 00:29:38,237
Look what l found.

484
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,657
Ah.

485
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:45,661
You know what?
Maybe we should finish up here.

486
00:29:49,248 --> 00:29:52,543
Maybe we should
have a drink.

487
00:30:07,975 --> 00:30:11,103
We should probably finish up with
the little paperwork we have.

488
00:30:13,564 --> 00:30:17,067
Are you a business-
before-pleasure kind of guy?

489
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:20,279
Well, there are a whole group of people
who think that that's the way to go.

490
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:39,548
- Uh, it's like you're worried?
- lt's like l feel like there's like--

491
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:40,966
like peaks and valleys.

492
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:43,093
There's always--
but that's everybody, you know?

493
00:30:43,177 --> 00:30:45,929
That's-that's-- and that's
life, and l think that's God's plan.

494
00:30:46,013 --> 00:30:47,723
- Peaks and valleys.
- Peaks and valleys.

495
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:50,976
Which is--which is
the bad part?

496
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:54,188
- ls it the peak orthe valley?
- l would go with the valley

497
00:30:54,271 --> 00:30:56,690
only because it's lower
than the peak and you just--

498
00:30:56,773 --> 00:30:59,276
you know, in a--
in a whole state you feel that way.

499
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:02,571
Yeah, like you're just
like, out there alone.

500
00:31:02,613 --> 00:31:05,532
- Right.
-You know what l mean?

501
00:31:16,126 --> 00:31:18,128
You're so in control.

502
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:21,048
l like that.

503
00:31:21,131 --> 00:31:24,218
Turns me on.

504
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:28,931
You're such...

505
00:31:31,058 --> 00:31:32,768
a man.

506
00:31:35,312 --> 00:31:39,107
Well, that's all an act.

507
00:31:39,149 --> 00:31:41,109
Make-believe a lot.

508
00:31:41,151 --> 00:31:44,154
l used to make-believe
all the time.

509
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,867
Are you
making-believe now?

510
00:31:48,951 --> 00:31:52,120
Just... you know,

511
00:31:52,162 --> 00:31:55,207

512
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:58,710
We cheat.

513
00:31:58,794 --> 00:32:00,754
That's why you always win.

514
00:32:08,178 --> 00:32:10,722
We should wrap up
the food business.

515
00:32:10,806 --> 00:32:12,766
Yeah.

516
00:32:15,561 --> 00:32:18,605
Yeah, we should do that.

the paperwork.

519
00:32:26,613 --> 00:32:28,574
Don't you think?

520
00:32:28,657 --> 00:32:29,867
We will, we will.

Nothing.
We're just talking.

641

00:39:19,943 --> 00:39:23,155
But my real passion

662
00:39:23,238 --> 00:39:27,034
What? Are you kidding?
You have two jobs?

the finer cuts of beef.

673
00:39:54,978 --> 00:39:58,941
Uh, the--the real good
dry-aged stuff.

674
00:39:59,024 --> 00:40:03,862
But if you age your veal,
Dave, is it still a veal?

675
00:40:03,946 --> 00:40:06,657
'Cause it's like
gotta grow up sometime,

676
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:09,576
and then
what does it become?

677
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,995
lt's kind of like
child actors,

678
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,081
you know how they never
grow up, they're always--

679
00:40:14,164 --> 00:40:16,041
You shut up.

680
00:40:17,918 --> 00:40:19,878
-What?
-Just shut up.

681
00:40:23,048 --> 00:40:26,885
So, is your stuff
the really good stuff?

682
00:40:26,969 --> 00:40:28,804
'Cause the Japanese stuff
is really excellent.

683
00:40:28,887 --> 00:40:31,223
You know what they do to keep
their beef extra soft?

684
00:40:31,306 --> 00:40:33,851
'Cause l read that they--
they pound on 'em with theirfists.

685
00:40:33,934 --> 00:40:36,854
He's gotta pound the cow. They--they
pound it. They pound the cow.

686
00:40:36,937 --> 00:40:39,022
Right, that's Kobe beef.

687
00:40:39,106 --> 00:40:42,109
So you're a steak man,
medium rare.

688
00:40:42,192 --> 00:40:44,862
- Rare. You?
- Rare, yeah yeah.

689
00:40:44,945 --> 00:40:46,613
- Me too, same.
-Yeah.

690
00:40:46,697 --> 00:40:49,575
You know, that's how l knew,
'cause l can-- l am the same.

691
00:40:49,658 --> 00:40:53,829
-Well, are you hungry?
- l am hungry.

692
00:40:53,912 --> 00:40:55,164
-You want a drink?
- l would love--

693
00:40:55,205 --> 00:40:56,707
Shut the fuck up,
of course you do.

694
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:58,167
-You want a drink, honey?
-A drink.

695
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:00,002
You want a drink?
You want the whole bottle?

696
00:41:00,085 --> 00:41:01,837
Just a drink, please.

697
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,631
Come on, Dave, escape the asylum.
Try not to knock anything over.

698
00:41:04,715 --> 00:41:06,508
Dave, l'll see you later.

699
00:41:08,844 --> 00:41:11,263
Shouldn't do it, shouldn't do it,
but l'm gonna do it.

700
00:41:11,346 --> 00:41:14,057
l hate to cheat, Dave,
see these puppies?

701
00:41:14,141 --> 00:41:16,768
They should marinate
for about another-- another day.

702
00:41:16,852 --> 00:41:19,563
lt's best just before it rots.
Hold on to that, will you?

703
00:41:19,646 --> 00:41:21,607
See that? Marbling.

704
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:23,901
You know
what that does?

705
00:41:23,984 --> 00:41:26,945
That's very very desirable. That's a
meatman's best friend right there.

706
00:41:27,029 --> 00:41:28,822
Yeah, this is a lot
like our beef.

707
00:41:28,906 --> 00:41:31,867
- Uh... l'd like to tell you something.
- Out to the 'que, Dave.

708
00:41:31,909 --> 00:41:36,371
You know what, l'd like to see a little
bit more marbling in them myself

709
00:41:36,413 --> 00:41:38,916
- Now we can vary the thickness foryou.
-Yeah?

710
00:41:38,957 --> 00:41:41,710
Yeah, we can cut an inch,
inch and a half,

711
00:41:41,752 --> 00:41:43,545
restaurant cut,
whicheveryou prefer.

712
00:41:43,629 --> 00:41:46,006
Now, Mr. Goldbluth,
he'd love that.

713
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:47,633
He knows his stuff.

714
00:41:47,716 --> 00:41:49,551
ls he a connoisseur?

715
00:41:49,635 --> 00:41:51,178
Oh, he loves to eat.

716
00:41:51,261 --> 00:41:54,473
He's got food flown in
from all overthe world, that guy.

717
00:41:54,556 --> 00:41:56,808
- He got ''cav-i-are'' from Russia.

718
00:41:56,892 --> 00:41:59,728
He got these little
fucking figs from like lran.

719
00:41:59,811 --> 00:42:02,356
He's got these special
cakes from Paris.

720
00:42:04,107 --> 00:42:06,568
-You know, France?
- Oh yeah, right, that's great.

721
00:42:08,403 --> 00:42:11,907
You know, l think a lot of the taste
depends on how good you can cook.

722
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:14,034
You know, the good thing is we can
help you with that too.

723

We can provide recipes and we'll take
you along step by step, if you, uh...

724
00:42:19,581 --> 00:42:21,708
l'm gonna let that slide,
what you just said.

725
00:42:24,962 --> 00:42:26,880
Just don't forget
about it.

726
00:42:26,964 --> 00:42:30,092

cooking lessons around here.

727
00:42:30,175 --> 00:42:32,094

00:42:53,073 --> 00:42:55,033
Maurice?

733
00:42:56,785 --> 00:42:58,745
Can l kiss you again?

734
00:42:59,872 --> 00:43:02,249
No.

No no, just tell me,

00:43:32,237 --> 00:43:34,156
Wait a minute,
don't say anything weird.

742
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:36,366
But there's
nothing weird.

743
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:40,287
They just made one thing
into anotherthing.

744
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:43,707
They just made my outie
into an innie.

745
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:46,418
Like a belly button.

746
00:43:48,504 --> 00:43:50,422
- Better.
- Okay.

747
00:43:50,506 --> 00:43:53,342
Okay, l could see
how that could be.

00:43:53,425 --> 00:43:55,677
Yeah.

749
00:43:55,761 --> 00:43:57,804
And...

750
00:43:57,888 --> 00:43:59,765
you're happy

751
00:43:59,848 --> 00:44:02,309
Ecstatic.

752
00:44:13,987 --> 00:44:16,406
So it's okay.

753
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:17,741
What?

754
00:44:17,825 --> 00:44:19,785

757
00:44:45,352 --> 00:44:47,896
l don't see pink anywhere.
That's a light red?

758
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:49,648
-Yeah, that's exactly what it is.

-Well, let's drink to light red.
-Absolutely.

763
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:58,365

lt's okay.

781

l'm through. l quit.

782
00:45:50,334 --> 00:45:52,002
Will you stop it?
Let's just close this.

783
00:45:52,085 --> 00:45:54,463
Let me show you guys
a little smoking technique.

784
00:45:54,546 --> 00:45:57,716
- Let her ride.
-A little smoking special technique.

785
00:45:57,799 --> 00:46:01,720
Goldbluth showed it to me.
Slam it down, slam it up.

786
00:46:01,803 --> 00:46:04,056
That's great.

787
00:46:04,139 --> 00:46:05,933
- That's a good move.
- That's super.

788
00:46:06,016 --> 00:46:08,644
- Close what?
- Two boxes, now go get the book.

789
00:46:08,685 --> 00:46:11,021
That is one gourmet
technique right there.

790
00:46:11,104 --> 00:46:13,982
Are you-- l don't like this fucking guy.
Nothing is right here.

00:46:14,024 --> 00:46:17,653
Let me tell you something:
He's solid. Now get the book.

792
00:46:17,694 --> 00:46:19,655
Pull yourself together.

That's sweet.

794
00:46:21,031 --> 00:46:23,367
You're giving me
the lessons now, look at this.

795
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:25,118
Just gonna need
some information.

796
00:46:25,202 --> 00:46:27,663
- From me to you...
- Do you know that one time

797
00:46:27,746 --> 00:46:32,459
he made me sit and watch
this educational film on taxidermy,

798
00:46:32,543 --> 00:46:35,963
and then he asked me-- he's like,
''How much do you think it costs

799
00:46:36,046 --> 00:46:40,342
to clean and stuff
a 115-lb. ape?''

800
00:46:40,425 --> 00:46:44,346
And l'm like, ''What?!
That's how much l weigh.''

801
00:46:46,056 --> 00:46:49,101
- Oh my God, no.
- Should l get that?

802
00:46:56,733 --> 00:46:57,776
Si?

834
00:48:29,952 --> 00:48:31,912
But first,

Come on.

You mean to eat?

907
00:51:54,406 --> 00:51:56,575
Talking about the best

So-- so they

00:52:26,396 --> 00:52:29,483
Tony-- he was a prick.
l knew him for 20 minutes,

918
00:52:29,566 --> 00:52:31,401
and he was annoying me.

919
00:52:31,485 --> 00:52:34,196
He's very disrespectful.
lf l had any bullets,

920
00:52:34,238 --> 00:52:35,823
l would've shot the fuck
out of him myself.

921
00:52:35,906 --> 00:52:39,201
The only thing we owe
to you forthat is gratitude.

922
00:52:39,243 --> 00:52:41,703
Big time.
Thank you both.

923
00:52:41,745 --> 00:52:43,705

All right. Well, how are we
gonna do this, then?

926
00:52:57,511 --> 00:52:58,971
l don't know.

927
00:53:00,681 --> 00:53:02,683
- l was thinking that we could--
- No no, please.

928
00:53:02,766 --> 00:53:04,852
- Shut your cakehole, please.
- Christ.

929

930
00:53:10,107 --> 00:53:12,568
Do you guys...

931
00:53:12,609 --> 00:53:14,570

948
00:53:58,489 --> 00:54:00,908

-And, you know, my, my wife,

949
00:54:00,991 --> 00:54:04,203
my ex-wife--

951
00:54:06,288 --> 00:54:09,041
- how it all-- it all ties in.
-We're all--

952
00:54:09,124 --> 00:54:10,918
we're all in it.

953
00:54:18,133 --> 00:54:20,093
l got a great respect
foryou, Bobby.

954
00:54:23,347 --> 00:54:25,474
l would like...

955
00:54:25,516 --> 00:54:27,809
very much just to give you
your gun back.

956
00:54:29,311 --> 00:54:31,647
Well, Maurice,
l would very much like that...

957
00:54:31,688 --> 00:54:33,774
too.

958
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:37,361
Would you pledge
to me,

959
00:54:37,444 --> 00:54:40,531
man to man,
that we can just sit down

960
00:54:40,614 --> 00:54:42,991
and eat together
as friends?

961
00:54:43,033 --> 00:54:45,327
We'll show you how
you can eat like kings...

962
00:54:45,369 --> 00:54:47,663
and then we'll
all go our separate ways.

963
00:54:48,997 --> 00:54:51,875
Yeah, l think
we could do that.

964
00:54:51,959 --> 00:54:55,963
-Yeah, l don't see--
- ls that a promise?

965
00:54:56,046 --> 00:54:57,798
-Absolutely.

966
00:54:57,881 --> 00:55:00,884
A pledge of honor?

967
00:55:00,968 --> 00:55:02,803
Honor is
very important.

968
00:55:02,886 --> 00:55:05,055
Sinatra said
that it's everything.

969
00:55:05,138 --> 00:55:07,641
lt's everything
a man's worth, honor.

970
00:55:07,724 --> 00:55:11,019
l think the honor system,
when instilled correctly,

971
00:55:11,061 --> 00:55:13,397
is-- is a good system.

972
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,941
So--

973
00:55:16,024 --> 00:55:18,694
so let's do it that way,
strictly with honor.

974
00:55:32,332 --> 00:55:33,750
Thank you

975
00:55:33,834 --> 00:55:35,669
-You're a good pro.
-Appreciate it.

Look, ljust want you to do

990
00:56:19,588 --> 00:56:21,715
'Cause if you don't stay healthy,

991
00:56:21,798 --> 00:56:25,385
- Now, l'll see you later, huh?
- Okay.

Tell him about
Maury and the doctor.

00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:31,350
- Oh, shut up.
- Shut the fuck up.

995
00:56:31,433 --> 00:56:33,185

-Are you bullshitting me?

996
00:56:33,268 --> 00:56:35,437
- No, it's-- it's-- it's fine.
-Who's Maury and the doctor?

997
00:56:35,521 --> 00:56:39,566
lt's just two guys that came out the
woodwork. Everything is under control.

998
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:42,236
-Yeah, well, get rid of them.
-Well, l, l can't do that now, Boris.

999
00:56:42,277 --> 00:56:44,613
-Why not?

00:56:49,076 --> 00:56:51,495
Okay, everything
is under control.

1003
00:56:51,578 --> 00:56:54,331
-You're not done. l need you here.
- Okay.

1004
00:56:54,414 --> 00:56:56,416
Goldbluth's having
the party for his kid.

1005
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:58,794
He's open, he's exposed--

1006
00:56:58,877 --> 00:57:00,796
it's getting late.
l want you to clean yourself up

1007
00:57:00,879 --> 00:57:03,215
- and get over here.
-Well, what do you mean ''clean''?

1008
00:57:03,298 --> 00:57:06,134
Put on a tie.
lt's a party.

1009
00:57:10,389 --> 00:57:14,393
Okay, this is my-- Boris, he said that
we-- uh, we gotta take them out.

1010
00:57:14,476 --> 00:57:16,186
- No! Stop!
-We gotta take them out!

1011
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:17,729
- Oh my God!
- Come on, no! Come on, man!

1012
00:57:17,813 --> 00:57:19,565
-We had a thing set up.
-We went through this!

1013
00:57:19,648 --> 00:57:21,525
- Be quiet! Shut up.
- Please.

1014
00:57:21,608 --> 00:57:23,569
-We got a promise together.
- Quiet! No no, we're not doing it now.

1015
00:57:23,652 --> 00:57:25,320
We're gonna get paid.
We're gonna work out a deal. Shut up.

1016
00:57:25,362 --> 00:57:27,573
- Hey, we have a thing.
- No, we don't have a thing, okay?

1017
00:57:27,656 --> 00:57:29,283
Every time l break a deal,
my life gets better,

1018
00:57:29,324 --> 00:57:32,369
so sit the fuck down
and shut up,

1019
00:57:32,452 --> 00:57:34,663
big mouth.

1020
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:48,844
We're just gonna walk away.
You'll never see us again.

1021
00:57:48,927 --> 00:57:50,971
- Right, no.
- lf you let us go right now.

1022
00:57:51,054 --> 00:57:53,348
- Okay, that works for me.
-We're not gonna say anything, man.

1023
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:55,350
Okay. Right. And your
mother's name is what?

1024
00:57:55,392 --> 00:57:58,270
- That sucks.
- Suzanne, go to Loridonna's house.

1025
00:57:58,353 --> 00:58:01,190
-Yeah, l am.
- Because you and Tony had a fight.

1026
00:58:01,231 --> 00:58:03,817
- Oh, like an alibi.
- That's right.

1027
00:58:03,901 --> 00:58:05,652
One: You and Tony
had a fight.

1028
00:58:05,736 --> 00:58:07,613
Two: You were
at Lori's house all day.

1029
00:58:07,696 --> 00:58:10,282
And three: You have no idea where
Tony is. lt's one, two, three.

1030
00:58:12,993 --> 00:58:14,953
Oh, Jesus.

1031
00:58:20,667 --> 00:58:22,669
Suzy, where's Tony?

1032
00:58:22,753 --> 00:58:25,672
l don't know.

1033
00:58:56,245 --> 00:58:58,288
What are you
gonna do with these guys?

1034
00:58:58,372 --> 00:59:00,791
Don't worry about them.
They're not going anywhere.

1035
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:06,380
- Do you think they're gone?
- l don't hear anything.

1036
00:59:06,421 --> 00:59:08,423
All right. All right,
let's try. Move over.

1037
00:59:08,465 --> 00:59:10,801
Tuck! Tuck in!
Tuck in!

1038
00:59:10,884 --> 00:59:12,845
- That's all l got.
- Tuck in! Tuck in!

1039
00:59:15,931 --> 00:59:18,642
-All right--
- Kick that son of a bitch.

1040
00:59:18,725 --> 00:59:20,144
- Kick out.
- lt's out!

1041
00:59:20,227 --> 00:59:21,854
- lt's out!
- Go, just go.

1042
00:59:21,937 --> 00:59:24,273
All right.
Push me. Push.

1043
00:59:24,356 --> 00:59:26,608
All right, l'm out.

1044
00:59:28,819 --> 00:59:31,488
Come on, gimme your hands.
l'll pull you out.

1045
00:59:31,572 --> 00:59:35,159
Ready, one, two...

1046
00:59:35,242 --> 00:59:37,244
Oh, boy, this ain't
happening, man.

1047
00:59:37,327 --> 00:59:39,997
- Go back in. l'll come around.
-All right. Oh, fuck me.

1048
00:59:44,459 --> 00:59:46,795
l'm-- l'm stuck
in both directions.

1049
00:59:46,879 --> 00:59:48,797
All right, hold on.
l'll go around.

1050
00:59:48,881 --> 00:59:51,300
Just relax, relax.

1051
00:59:56,513 --> 00:59:59,224
- Get me out of here.
- l know. l know, shut up.

1052
00:59:59,308 --> 01:00:02,853
- Maury, l don't like this.
- l know, l know.

1053
01:00:07,691 --> 01:00:10,194
What are you doing?

1054
01:00:12,029 --> 01:00:13,655
All right.

1055
01:00:13,739 --> 01:00:16,158
- Think l threw up a little.
- l'm coming around.

1056
01:00:17,576 --> 01:00:19,620
Maury, you can't
leave me in here. Maury!

1057
01:00:20,662 --> 01:00:22,414
Aw, shit! l gotta
find something!

1058
01:00:22,498 --> 01:00:23,957
- Maury!
- l'll be right back!

1059
01:00:24,041 --> 01:00:25,918
- Get me out of here first!
- l'll be right back.

1060
01:00:26,001 --> 01:00:28,086
Maury, don't
leave me alone.

1061
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:30,297
l feel alone, Maury!
Am l?!

1062
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:32,508
Get me out of here!

1063
01:00:36,178 --> 01:00:38,096
Ready! Pick them up!

1064
01:01:15,634 --> 01:01:18,011
Mr. Goldbluth--well,
you've given us

1065
01:01:18,095 --> 01:01:20,806
a beautiful celebration
with a bounty of food

1066
01:01:20,889 --> 01:01:24,518
that is, as always,
an exquisite experience.

1067
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:28,522
And l say, on the occasion of Jerry
becoming a man...

1068
01:01:31,692 --> 01:01:34,444
thank you,
Cookie Goldbluth.

1069
01:01:34,528 --> 01:01:36,697
Thank you
foryour generosity

1070
01:01:36,738 --> 01:01:40,450
and your hospitality
and your good taste.

1071
01:01:57,384 --> 01:02:00,220
You said that exactly
the way l told you to.

1072
01:02:03,891 --> 01:02:06,768
Well,

1073
01:02:06,810 --> 01:02:08,395
now let us give
thanks to God

1074
01:02:08,479 --> 01:02:11,273
who brought us
all togethertoday

1075
01:02:11,356 --> 01:02:14,234
as a boy becomes
a man in His eyes,

1076
01:02:14,318 --> 01:02:18,405
and a son becomes
a man in the eyes of his father.

1077
01:02:18,489 --> 01:02:21,074
lt's been said that
a boy becomes a man

1078
01:02:21,158 --> 01:02:23,368
when a man is needed.

1079
01:02:23,452 --> 01:02:26,914
But when is he needed?

1080
01:02:26,955 --> 01:02:29,750
During our service
this morning,

1081
01:02:29,791 --> 01:02:31,919
Jerry read
about a people who,

1082
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:34,671
fleeing a mighty army,

1083
01:02:34,755 --> 01:02:37,090
were faced
with the prospect of climbing

1084
01:02:37,174 --> 01:02:39,635
an impossible mountain,

1085
01:02:39,676 --> 01:02:42,971
and God spoke,
and He said,

1086
01:02:43,013 --> 01:02:45,140
''Make an alliance with Me,

1087
01:02:45,224 --> 01:02:48,143
to climb this mountain
halfway.''

1088
01:02:48,185 --> 01:02:52,272
When those who survived
made it as far as they could,

1089
01:02:52,356 --> 01:02:54,566
the hand of God

1090
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:57,110
reached down
from the heavens

1091
01:02:57,194 --> 01:02:58,737
and lifted them
to the top.

1092
01:03:12,376 --> 01:03:14,419
l saw him, Dave.
He was very beautiful.

1093
01:03:16,213 --> 01:03:19,800
-Yeah? Who would that be?
- Goldbluth.

1094
01:03:19,842 --> 01:03:21,969
Perfect prospect,
our guy.

1095
01:03:22,052 --> 01:03:25,138
Fuck out of here, man.

1096
01:03:25,222 --> 01:03:27,641
Okay, we had enough fun
for one day, don't you think?

1097
01:03:27,683 --> 01:03:30,060
- People in there wanna kill us.
-And him.

1098
01:03:30,144 --> 01:03:32,855
They're putting a hit on Goldbluth.
Come on, let's go.

1099
01:03:32,896 --> 01:03:36,275
Mau-- Maury, stop, okay?
There's psychotic motherfuckers in there

1100
01:03:36,358 --> 01:03:39,111
trying to end our lives. Okay?
Be happy you're not dead.

1101
01:03:39,194 --> 01:03:42,364
Something brought us
to this moment, to Goldbluth.

1102
01:03:42,406 --> 01:03:44,366
lt's so clear, Davey.
Today was no accident.

1103
01:03:44,449 --> 01:03:46,535
Everything led us here.

1104
01:03:46,618 --> 01:03:49,663
This idea we had
of-of the perfect prospect,

1105
01:03:49,746 --> 01:03:53,125
we made it up.
lt's a fantasy.

1106
01:03:53,208 --> 01:03:55,502
Yeah, but l now know
what we were talking about.

1107
01:03:55,586 --> 01:03:57,713
lt's like we were saying,
''lf somebody is up there,

1108
01:03:57,796 --> 01:04:01,175
then He should create
a guy like this for us.'' And He did.

1109
01:04:01,216 --> 01:04:04,469
Everybody is always
saying they think they saw God--

1110
01:04:04,553 --> 01:04:07,764
''lt's like l saw God.'' But there's a big
difference from that...

1111
01:04:07,848 --> 01:04:09,808
and when you really
see Him.

1112
01:04:11,059 --> 01:04:13,020
What did you see?

1113
01:04:13,061 --> 01:04:15,397
l told you.

1114
01:04:34,791 --> 01:04:36,752
Let's go.

1115
01:04:56,396 --> 01:04:58,899
Wow, he is beautiful.

1116
01:05:00,275 --> 01:05:02,861
Look.

1117
01:05:02,945 --> 01:05:04,196
Leon?!

1118
01:05:04,279 --> 01:05:06,740
What the hell
is he doing here?

1119
01:05:06,782 --> 01:05:09,785
Brought, like us.

1120
01:05:17,292 --> 01:05:19,878
Shit. Come on!
Let's go around.

1121
01:05:21,755 --> 01:05:23,799
- Bobby, what year is the Caddy?
- l don't know from cars.

1122
01:05:23,882 --> 01:05:25,425
-What is it, lrv?
- lt's a '89.

1123
01:05:25,509 --> 01:05:26,969
- '89? Hope it's a big boy.
-Yeah.

1124
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:28,470
- '89--
- Broads love those cars.

1125
01:05:28,512 --> 01:05:29,972
- Oh, it's a nice car.
- Oh!

1126
01:05:30,055 --> 01:05:32,724
Excuse me. You know,
l don't work forfree, Boris.

1127
01:05:32,808 --> 01:05:34,935
l mean, this isn't my hobby,
you know what l mean?

1128
01:05:34,977 --> 01:05:37,396
lf you want people walking around
saying, ''Boris this, Boris that,''

1129
01:05:37,479 --> 01:05:39,439
that's fine. Otherwise, you know,
you gotta make an offer.

1130
01:05:39,481 --> 01:05:40,858
- For money.
- Hey hey hey hey hey.

1131
01:05:40,941 --> 01:05:43,277
Look, we'll take both
these cocksuckers out for--

1132
01:05:43,318 --> 01:05:44,611
10 each.

1133
01:05:44,695 --> 01:05:45,863
Would you just relax,
let me work out the details?

1134
01:05:45,946 --> 01:05:47,739
-All right.
-We're gonna do two for one.

1135
01:05:47,823 --> 01:05:49,408
Yeah yeah. l'll decide
what they're worth.

1136
01:05:49,491 --> 01:05:51,285
All right, all right,
all right.

1137
01:05:55,497 --> 01:05:57,249
-What did you do?
- l didn't do anything!

1138
01:05:57,332 --> 01:05:59,293
-You're supposed to be the taper.
- Hey, this got messy.

1139
01:05:59,376 --> 01:06:01,170
- l--you saw me tape them up.
- l told you guys--

1140
01:06:01,253 --> 01:06:03,797
Hey! --no messy!
Now find these assholes.

1141
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:05,591
Then you come back
for Goldbluth.

1142
01:06:05,674 --> 01:06:07,593
l'm at the bar.

1143
01:06:09,511 --> 01:06:11,430
How come every time
something's fucking up,

1144
01:06:11,513 --> 01:06:13,474
it's my fault?!

1145
01:06:15,309 --> 01:06:17,311
All right, we gotta talk fast.
You gotta close hard.

1146
01:06:17,394 --> 01:06:19,438
l'm fast. l'm hard.

1147
01:06:26,361 --> 01:06:27,821
Hey, how you doing?

1148
01:06:27,863 --> 01:06:29,239
Leon!

1149
01:06:29,323 --> 01:06:30,741
Hey.

1150
01:06:30,824 --> 01:06:32,201
You guys.

1151
01:06:32,284 --> 01:06:35,871
Hey, look. Who is that?
Do you remember?

1152
01:06:35,954 --> 01:06:37,998
That's your lovely
lady-friend Karen.

1153
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:40,000
Used to be.

1154
01:06:40,042 --> 01:06:43,170
Now she is my lovely
fiance Karen.

1155
01:06:43,253 --> 01:06:45,756
- Hey, good foryou.
- Congratulations.

1156
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:47,299
No, next dance,
honey, next one.

1157
01:06:47,382 --> 01:06:48,926
So are you a friend
of the Goldbluths?

1158
01:06:49,009 --> 01:06:51,303
Uh, l'm Jerry's
piano teacher. You?

1159
01:06:51,386 --> 01:06:54,139
Uh, we have a dearfriend in common
who wants us, actually,

1160
01:06:54,223 --> 01:06:55,808
to expose Mr. Goldbluth
to our high end.

1161
01:06:55,891 --> 01:06:58,977
Yeah, Goldbluth, there's a man
you should talk to about fine foods.

1162
01:06:59,061 --> 01:07:01,021
Come on,
l'll introduce you.

1163
01:07:05,526 --> 01:07:08,654
These guys, for a living
they're meat salesman?

1164
01:07:08,737 --> 01:07:09,863
Yeah.

1165
01:07:09,947 --> 01:07:11,573
They knock on people's
door and say,

1166
01:07:11,657 --> 01:07:14,535
''Do you wanna buy
a fucking cheeseburger?''

1167
01:07:14,576 --> 01:07:16,703
That's a living?
That's a life?

1168
01:07:19,122 --> 01:07:21,208
- Mr. Goldbluth.
-Yes, sir?

1169
01:07:21,291 --> 01:07:24,837
l-l want you to meet
some people here-- gentlemen.

1170
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:27,673
- Uh, this is Dave and...
- Maury.

1171
01:07:27,756 --> 01:07:28,715
- Morty. Dave and Morty.
- Hi.

1172
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:29,633
- This is Mr. Goldbluth.
- Hi, how are you?

1173
01:07:29,716 --> 01:07:31,218
- Beautiful party here.
-very good.

1174
01:07:31,301 --> 01:07:33,846
Tony said you have a great
appreciation for good taste.

1175
01:07:33,929 --> 01:07:36,181
- He said we should connect.
-Yeah, where is Tony?

1176
01:07:36,265 --> 01:07:38,350
Yeah, l'm sure he'll be here.
He speaks very highly of you, sir.

1177
01:07:38,433 --> 01:07:40,561
He said you taught him
everything he knows about barbecue.

1178
01:07:40,602 --> 01:07:44,398
Yeah, well... what the hell does
he know? See you.

1179
01:07:45,941 --> 01:07:48,152
No, really, he says
you're a real magician, you know.

1180
01:07:48,235 --> 01:07:50,571
We supply gourmet clients with
the finest beef in the world.

1181
01:07:50,612 --> 01:07:52,322
We just--we think
you should have the best.

1182
01:07:52,406 --> 01:07:54,783
- ls that right?
-Yeah.

1183
01:07:54,867 --> 01:07:56,285
- Mr. Goldbluth, sir?
-Yeah.

1184
01:07:56,326 --> 01:08:01,415
Oh! l already got the best.
See, l get it from Omaha.

1185
01:08:01,456 --> 01:08:03,625
So you guys have
a good time anyway, okay?

1186
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:08,213
Hey, champ!

1187
01:08:21,894 --> 01:08:23,854
Ladies and gentlemen.

1188
01:08:29,109 --> 01:08:31,278
Gentlemen.

1189
01:08:40,662 --> 01:08:43,373
You guys are almost
the same age.

1190
01:08:43,457 --> 01:08:45,167
Cindy, meet my son Jerry.

1191
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:46,835
Hi, Jerry.
Nice to meet you.

1192
01:08:46,919 --> 01:08:48,712
What the hell's
going on here?

1193
01:08:50,130 --> 01:08:53,592
Can you excuse us real quick?
Dad, come here.

1194
01:08:53,675 --> 01:08:55,886
Do you think l'm ready?

1195
01:08:55,969 --> 01:08:58,847
Are you kidding?
You're gonna love it.

1196
01:08:58,889 --> 01:09:01,350
-Jesus.
- Listen, when l was your age,

1197
01:09:01,433 --> 01:09:04,144
l would have given my right arm
forthis-- a setup like this.

1198
01:09:04,186 --> 01:09:07,397
My first time l was 10.
l mean you're like old already.

1199
01:09:07,481 --> 01:09:09,358
- Go on, she won't bite.
-All right, look,

1200
01:09:09,399 --> 01:09:11,109
you stick with him,
l'm gonna check the front.

1201
01:09:11,193 --> 01:09:13,070
They're gonna kill him
when they get back.

1202
01:09:13,153 --> 01:09:15,739
-We gotta sell him now. Bring him in.
- Uh... ah.

1203
01:09:23,205 --> 01:09:25,666
Harold, what is go--
what is going on?

1204
01:09:25,707 --> 01:09:27,376
-Where's Jerry?
- ln the car.

1205
01:09:27,417 --> 01:09:30,504
- ln the ca--
- Faye, Faye, Faye, Faye, come on.

1206
01:09:30,546 --> 01:09:33,257
What's the matter with you?
The girl does parties.

1207
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:35,342
You know-- graduations,
birthday parties.

1208
01:09:35,425 --> 01:09:37,052
Harry!

1209
01:09:47,855 --> 01:09:49,857
Wish l had a camera.

1210
01:09:49,898 --> 01:09:51,567
This could be like
a ''happiness'' poster.

1211
01:09:51,608 --> 01:09:53,819
You know, the ones they sell
in the fine gift shops.

1212
01:09:53,902 --> 01:09:56,864
Thanks.
You hearthat? lt's obvious.

1213
01:09:56,905 --> 01:09:58,657
l'm getting rid
of that girl.

1214
01:09:58,740 --> 01:10:02,578
Let him just have a hand job.
Just... one time.

1215
01:10:02,619 --> 01:10:06,623
- One time.
- There, see?

1216
01:10:06,707 --> 01:10:09,835
Have another drink.

1217
01:10:09,918 --> 01:10:11,587
Who is that?

1218
01:10:13,505 --> 01:10:17,551
You really keep her off balance, keeps
the flame alive, huh, Mr. Goldbluth?

1219
01:10:17,593 --> 01:10:19,678
Cookie, call me Cookie.

1220
01:10:19,761 --> 01:10:21,680
Let me ask you something.
When you do your grilling,

1221
01:10:21,763 --> 01:10:24,766
you like your steak cut
an inch or an inch and a half thick?

1222
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:27,227
What, are you putting me on?
Two inches.

1223
01:10:27,269 --> 01:10:29,730
These guys are gone,
they're long gone.

1224
01:10:29,771 --> 01:10:31,315
You know what?
l'm done.

1225
01:10:31,398 --> 01:10:34,526
l wanna go get Goldbluth
and l wanna call it a night.

1226
01:10:39,406 --> 01:10:40,365
You know, l'm talking
about the best--

1227
01:10:40,449 --> 01:10:45,245
40-day-dry-aged prime Kobe-Angus
hybrids, superior animals.

1228
01:10:45,287 --> 01:10:46,914
- The best?
- On Earth.

1229
01:10:46,997 --> 01:10:49,249
On Mars, l don't know,
l've never eaten there.

1230
01:10:49,291 --> 01:10:51,668
Hey, Maury!

1231
01:10:51,752 --> 01:10:55,088
But anything, say within two, three
million miles of Sherman Oaks.

1232
01:10:55,130 --> 01:10:57,299
- This is five-star stuff.
- Huh.

1233
01:10:57,382 --> 01:11:00,010
- Get the book.
-What's the book?

1234
01:11:02,137 --> 01:11:04,598
The one monthly amount includes
everything--the filets, the T-bone,

1235
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:07,559
the New York cuts, the London broil
and the magnificent rib eye.

1236
01:11:07,643 --> 01:11:09,561
All at a fraction of the price
you're spending now

1237
01:11:09,645 --> 01:11:11,355
flying in who knows what
from Omaha.

1238
01:11:11,438 --> 01:11:14,066
- Excuse me?
- Let me show you something.

1239
01:11:14,149 --> 01:11:16,068
l don't wanna get
into he-said-she-said,

1240
01:11:16,151 --> 01:11:18,028
but this steer had problems
late in life.

1241
01:11:18,111 --> 01:11:19,988
ln all probability.

1242
01:11:20,030 --> 01:11:22,950
Are you saying this is bad meat?
This is prime beef.

1243
01:11:22,991 --> 01:11:25,160
This is choice
labeled as prime.

1244
01:11:25,244 --> 01:11:28,121
We see this all the time.
No attention to quality.

1245
01:11:28,163 --> 01:11:29,998
Mr. Goldbluth,

1246
01:11:30,082 --> 01:11:32,709
we can take you to the top
of the beef world.

1247
01:11:32,793 --> 01:11:35,587
The highest altitude
in gourmet dining.

1248
01:11:35,671 --> 01:11:38,841
Meat so soft, people don't even bother
to use theirteeth.

1249
01:11:38,924 --> 01:11:42,553
The meat just seems to melt as it makes
contact with your mouth.

1250
01:11:42,636 --> 01:11:44,888
Yeah.

1251
01:11:44,972 --> 01:11:46,890
You hearthat?

1252
01:11:46,974 --> 01:11:50,144
You don't even have
to chew it.

1253
01:11:51,562 --> 01:11:53,647
l like it.

1254
01:11:57,401 --> 01:11:59,236
lt was packed
full of meat like that.

1255
01:11:59,319 --> 01:12:01,697
lt looked
like a giant gift basket.

1256
01:12:01,780 --> 01:12:04,074
Make a-- a nice gift
forthe uncles.

1257
01:12:04,158 --> 01:12:06,034
- That's a lovely gesture.
-Yeah...

1258
01:12:06,118 --> 01:12:07,995
You know what?

1259
01:12:08,036 --> 01:12:11,331
l'm strangely attracted
to the misty yellow color.

1260
01:12:11,373 --> 01:12:13,584
You know, there's nothing
strange about that.

1261
01:12:25,888 --> 01:12:28,432
- Open the door!
- Ow!

1262
01:12:28,515 --> 01:12:30,350
-Another door.
-Again, you motherfucker.

1263
01:12:30,392 --> 01:12:31,810
Fuck you, l ain't
doing that again.

1264
01:12:31,894 --> 01:12:33,228
Let's go around this way.

1265
01:12:40,319 --> 01:12:42,738
Seven freezers,
seven uncles.

1266
01:12:42,779 --> 01:12:44,948
You know what?
l'm just gonna need to get

1267
01:12:45,032 --> 01:12:46,909
a little credit information,
nothing to worry about.

1268
01:12:46,992 --> 01:12:50,037
- Boris.
- Oh, nothing uh?

1269
01:12:50,078 --> 01:12:52,080
-Well, how screwed are we now?
-Just a little bit,

1270
01:12:52,164 --> 01:12:53,999
but we've got everything under control.
We chased them inside.

1271
01:12:54,082 --> 01:12:55,834
Yeah, they're hiding
in the kitchen.

1272
01:12:55,918 --> 01:12:58,045
Well, that's good. Now just find
Goldbluth and get him in there too,

1273
01:12:58,128 --> 01:12:59,880
because this is gonna be
a goodbye package.

1274
01:12:59,922 --> 01:13:01,590
Not a problem. We'll just bang him
with the othertwo.

1275
01:13:01,673 --> 01:13:04,009
Two red, two blue and...
right now.

1276
01:13:04,092 --> 01:13:06,595
Yeah, you know what? l'm just gonna need
you to sign right here,

1277
01:13:06,678 --> 01:13:08,388
here, here and here.

1278
01:13:08,430 --> 01:13:10,224
That's a lotta places.

1279
01:13:10,265 --> 01:13:11,850
Take it.

1280
01:13:16,814 --> 01:13:18,690
This is the best, right?

1281
01:13:18,774 --> 01:13:20,818
See, it's a matter
of personal preference.

1282
01:13:20,901 --> 01:13:23,821
- Davey!
- There's only one best.

1283
01:13:23,904 --> 01:13:27,616
That's what always pissed me off about
that expression, ''the best.''

1284
01:13:27,658 --> 01:13:29,326
l mean what is best?

1285
01:13:29,409 --> 01:13:32,120
ls it best for me
or is it what's best foryou?

1286
01:13:33,789 --> 01:13:35,999
You guys lied.

1287
01:13:36,083 --> 01:13:38,043
-You swore on Sinatra.
- Hey.

1288
01:13:46,635 --> 01:13:50,013
Go! Get him!
Go go go go go!

1289
01:13:50,097 --> 01:13:52,057
Watch out.

1290
01:13:54,143 --> 01:13:56,353
Move! Move! Go!

1291
01:13:56,436 --> 01:13:58,313
God damn it!

1292
01:13:58,397 --> 01:14:00,983
Tearthis fucking door down.

1293
01:14:03,318 --> 01:14:04,695
lt's preference.

1294
01:14:04,778 --> 01:14:06,655
lt's selling.
lt's selling.

1295
01:14:06,697 --> 01:14:09,283
And knowing what to buy,
who to buy it from.

1296
01:14:09,366 --> 01:14:12,828
For all l know, you two guys
could be shysters

1297
01:14:12,870 --> 01:14:16,123
who are trying to scam
the wrong motherfucker.

1298
01:14:23,005 --> 01:14:25,465
But you seem okay.

1299
01:14:35,017 --> 01:14:37,644
Mr. Goldbluth.

1300
01:14:37,686 --> 01:14:40,314
There's people in that party
that want to kill you.

1301
01:14:42,357 --> 01:14:44,276
There's a reason
why Tony isn't here.

1302
01:14:44,359 --> 01:14:46,528
Talk fast.

1303
01:14:49,281 --> 01:14:50,699
Get outta here.

1304
01:14:50,782 --> 01:14:52,826
-We're movin' out.
- Come on, Mr. Goldbluth.

1305
01:14:52,910 --> 01:14:54,495
Come on,
move it, move it.

1306
01:14:54,536 --> 01:14:55,704
- Ralph.
-Yeah, boss.

1307
01:14:55,787 --> 01:14:57,122
- 21 grand.
-You got it.

1308
01:14:59,666 --> 01:15:01,835
All right, fellas.

1309
01:15:01,919 --> 01:15:04,171
Foryour gifts.

1310
01:15:07,674 --> 01:15:10,511
Mr.Goldbluth,

1311
01:15:10,552 --> 01:15:12,846
it was yourfriend Tony's.

1312
01:15:17,142 --> 01:15:20,103
l'll be expecting some freezers
in the next 10 days.

1313
01:15:20,187 --> 01:15:23,065
They're on their way.

1314
01:15:44,711 --> 01:15:45,838
Dad!

1315
01:15:45,921 --> 01:15:48,090
l want that joint cleaned up
like it never happened.

1316
01:15:48,173 --> 01:15:49,174
Never happened.

1317
01:15:49,258 --> 01:15:50,801
Dad!

1318
01:15:50,884 --> 01:15:53,428
Dad, you okay?

1319
01:15:53,512 --> 01:15:57,474
l'm always okay.
We were just celebrating.

1320
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:10,070
Dick.

1321
01:16:10,112 --> 01:16:11,822
You look tired, Dick,
how you doing?

1322
01:16:11,905 --> 01:16:16,160
Jesus, by now l was expecting
a postcard from Ensenada.

1323
01:16:16,243 --> 01:16:17,786
-You get anything?
-We got anything?

1324
01:16:17,870 --> 01:16:19,663
l don't know,
let's check.

1325
01:16:19,746 --> 01:16:22,082
These count?

1326
01:16:22,124 --> 01:16:23,709
You know, why don't you
get Dick's opinion?

1327
01:16:23,792 --> 01:16:25,085
Three, what do you
think of that?

1328
01:16:25,127 --> 01:16:28,589
Whoa whoa whoa whoa.
Before you answer, how about four?

1329
01:16:28,672 --> 01:16:31,216
Of course, five is a number
that everybody is comfortable with.

1330
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:33,510
Probably the hand,
somethin' to do with that.

1331
01:16:33,594 --> 01:16:34,845
You wrote five?

1332
01:16:34,928 --> 01:16:36,847
No.

1333
01:16:36,930 --> 01:16:38,307
Six.

1334
01:16:38,390 --> 01:16:40,434
of course if l told you six,
l'd be lying.

1335
01:16:40,517 --> 01:16:42,603
- Because he'd be forgetting seven.
- Seven.

1336
01:16:42,644 --> 01:16:44,730
What the hell is this?

1337
01:16:44,813 --> 01:16:47,691
Seven. We wrote
some paper-- seven.

1338
01:16:47,774 --> 01:16:50,527
You want me to spike
seven boxes?

1339
01:16:50,611 --> 01:16:54,281
No, no, on this one
be leisurely, 'cause this is gold.

1340
01:16:54,323 --> 01:16:56,992
We got cash.
21 grand.

1341
01:16:57,075 --> 01:16:59,203
Minus our commission.

1342
01:17:27,689 --> 01:17:31,276
What is this? There you go.
Come on, honey, jump on.

1343
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:33,278
Mom, look what
Daddy got me.

1344
01:17:33,362 --> 01:17:36,323
- That's it, honey.
- Come on, come on. Ready?

1345
01:17:36,406 --> 01:17:39,117
-Yes, l am.
-We're gonna go up high.

1346
01:17:39,201 --> 01:17:41,036
Ain't she beautiful?

1347
01:17:41,078 --> 01:17:42,538
Maury, don't burn
my chicken.

1348
01:17:42,621 --> 01:17:44,998
You're burning
the chicken, you idiot.

1349
01:17:46,124 --> 01:17:48,377
Here's what we do--
some of this.
