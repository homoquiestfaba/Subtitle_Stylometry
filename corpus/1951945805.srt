00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:03,166
Have your new washer

346
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:08,605
Yes, Jay,
they have.

348
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:13,613
I would.

349
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:20,087
Because now,

twenty minutes in

a washing machine

00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:38,803

or travel halfway across

357
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:50,252
Because now
I have a dryer,

358
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:53,917
which is just
that. A dryer.

359

Morrie's always helped
you, hasn't he, Ida?

367
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:43,639
Every time you've called,
every six months or so.

368
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:49,136
I will pay him
back eventually.

369
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,772
You can pay
him back now.

370
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:54,012

Please. First thing.

371

I started dating.

376
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,325
Morrie's a great teacher.

377
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,427
Paul is not gonna punish
him just because I
came to see Jay.

378
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:15,871

you came? I mean,

You mean,

You were
gonna say back

It has been two years,
you never even
called him.

<i>Don't leave.</i>

858
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:30,296
Good morning. Thanks
for waiting. Sorry.

859
01:03:32,575 --> 01:03:34,941
Okay. For every action,

860
01:03:35,011 --> 01:03:39,277
there is an equal
and opposite reaction.

861
01:03:43,753 --> 01:03:44,742
Yeah.

862
01:03:53,462 --> 01:03:55,589
Well, look who
finally made it.

863
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:58,634
Rough morning.
Oar trouble.

864
01:04:00,303 --> 01:04:01,895
So, a couple things.

865
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:05,300
First...

866
01:04:05,374 --> 01:04:08,104
we felt, I 'm sorry,
we had to alert
the authorities...

867
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:11,806
<i>as to Jay's whereabouts.
J ust In case.</i>

868
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:13,439
Sure.

869
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:17,748
Someone has to protect
the innocent
and vulnerable.

870
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:20,550
Second, do you know where
your little sister was
this morning?

871
01:04:20,623 --> 01:04:23,148
<i>I'm pretty
sure she
was at Gary's.</i>

872
01:04:23,226 --> 01:04:26,718
I drove by on my way in
and I saw her car
parked in front.

873
01:04:26,796 --> 01:04:28,696
I would've stopped but
I didn't want to
be late.

874
01:04:28,764 --> 01:04:30,857
My lateness
this morning
was unavoidable.

875
01:04:30,933 --> 01:04:31,922
I'm just...

876
01:04:32,001 --> 01:04:33,935
It won't
happen again.

877
01:04:34,003 --> 01:04:36,267
Your lateness
is secondary.

878
01:04:36,339 --> 01:04:38,307
What do you want
me to say, Paul?

879
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:41,537
<i>You sald you would ensure
that Ida stayed away
from my brother.</i>

880
01:04:41,611 --> 01:04:44,978
I 'm just disappointed.
I trusted you.
We're friends.

881
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:47,709
I could consider you my
best friend. I don't
know what you think.

882
01:04:47,783 --> 01:04:51,446
<i>You dldn't dellver and that
says somethlng about
your character.</i>

883
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:55,456
I 'm sorry,
but I can't
control Ida.

884
01:04:55,524 --> 01:04:58,084
She's an adult
and so is Gary,

885
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:01,357
and even if Ida went
over there, I 'm sure
he could handle it.

886
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:03,591
No, he can't.
Okay? She's
poison to him.

887
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:06,134
She's already smashed
his life to shit once.

888
01:05:06,202 --> 01:05:08,534
Okay, I 'm getting
a little tired

889
01:05:08,604 --> 01:05:11,801
of Ida being blamed
for what happened
to Gary.

890
01:05:11,874 --> 01:05:13,136
Oh, you are?

891
01:05:13,209 --> 01:05:16,701
<i>Yeah. Gary chose
to get hammered...</i>

892
01:05:16,779 --> 01:05:19,111
and drive his car
100 miles an hour.

893
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:21,115
How is that
Ida's fault?

894
01:05:21,183 --> 01:05:23,048
He wouldn't have done
it if she hadn't taken
off on him

895
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:25,246
like some
wanton slut.

896
01:05:25,321 --> 01:05:30,190
Okay, don't... don't talk
about my little sister
that way.

897
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:31,658
Oome on, you
know it's true.

898
01:05:31,727 --> 01:05:33,354
Ida's always been
a total tramp.

899
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:38,594
What Ida does says
nothing about
my character.

900
01:05:38,668 --> 01:05:43,071
What Gary does
says nothing about
Ida's character.

901
01:05:43,139 --> 01:05:48,236
There is such a
thing in America as
personal responsibility.

902
