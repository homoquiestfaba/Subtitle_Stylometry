1
00:00:57,388 --> 00:01:01,556
Just what I need. An alarm pig.

2
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:15,736
Hungry? Want to eat this?

3
00:02:33,047 --> 00:02:34,613
Shit!

4
00:03:00,641 --> 00:03:01,239
Hi, Max.

5
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:05,142
We can forget about
the Kolchek account.

6
00:03:05,144 --> 00:03:06,610
Why?

7
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,247
I'd consider it moot since
Mr. Kolchek was found

8
00:03:11,249 --> 00:03:17,686
with a screwdriver embedded in
his skull at 10:30 last night.

9
00:03:17,688 --> 00:03:19,387
Apparently Mrs. Kolchek decided

10
00:03:19,389 --> 00:03:21,522
to conduct her
own investigation.

11
00:03:21,524 --> 00:03:22,222
You're kidding.

12
00:03:22,224 --> 00:03:25,124
Apparently her
suspicions were correct.

13
00:03:25,126 --> 00:03:27,693
I knew she was trouble as
soon as she walked in here.

14
00:03:27,695 --> 00:03:31,396
Both eyes moved in
different directions.

15
00:03:31,398 --> 00:03:32,296
Still, a screwdriver?

16
00:03:32,298 --> 00:03:35,999
I mean, who doesn't cheat
on their wife these days?

17
00:03:36,001 --> 00:03:38,568
I hope you don't, Max.
I really do.

18
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:43,406
If I did, at least I'd know
how to get away with it.

19
00:03:43,574 --> 00:03:47,075
Yeah, well, so did Mr. Kolchek.

20
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:17,003
May I help you?

21
00:04:17,005 --> 00:04:21,674
Isn't it against the law to
smoke in an office building?

22
00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:25,210
You must be Mrs. Farrow-Smith?

23
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,255
Hey, Mr. Farrow-Smith. You said
you'd let me take her out one day.

24
00:04:38,257 --> 00:04:40,223
Only if I can drive yours.

25
00:04:40,225 --> 00:04:42,558
What do you want to drive
my old beater for?

26
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,795
For the experience, Geri.
For the experience.

27
00:04:54,538 --> 00:04:55,737
Do you mind?

28
00:04:55,739 --> 00:04:57,605
Be my guest.

29
00:05:00,176 --> 00:05:02,643
If you want to die.

30
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:06,646
Well, that's just a matter
of timing, isn't it?

31
00:05:06,648 --> 00:05:07,446
Okay. You said on the phone

32
00:05:07,448 --> 00:05:12,317
that you had some concerns
about your husband?

33
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,385
That's one way of putting it.

34
00:05:14,387 --> 00:05:18,055
I am a woman who likes to
know where she stands.

35
00:05:18,057 --> 00:05:21,725
Have you seen any changes
in his behavior?

36
00:05:21,727 --> 00:05:24,461
You mean like losing
weight, exercising,

37
00:05:24,463 --> 00:05:26,529
cutting his hair,
and buying a new car?

38
00:05:26,531 --> 00:05:29,465
No, Mr. Isaac, there
haven't been any signs.

39
00:05:29,467 --> 00:05:31,700
I would be disappointed
if there were.

40
00:05:31,702 --> 00:05:34,869
My husband is never
obvious or predictable.

41
00:05:34,871 --> 00:05:38,072
Let's just say that we've reached
the point in our marriage

42
00:05:38,074 --> 00:05:41,308
where it would be
in my best interest

43
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,776
to know what he's like
when I'm not around.

44
00:05:42,778 --> 00:05:47,380
Well, Mrs. Farrow-Smith, that is
a service that we do provide.

45
00:05:47,382 --> 00:05:51,283
Good. Draw up whatever paperwork
you think is necessary.

46
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:56,521
Oh, one more thing, I would
like a woman working the case.

47
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:59,322
A woman? Uh...

48
00:05:59,691 --> 00:06:00,289
I would have to see.

49
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:03,058
I'd be much more
comfortable with a woman.

50
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,161
I saw one earlier in the hall.

51
00:06:06,163 --> 00:06:08,429
That would be Derian McCall.

52
00:06:08,431 --> 00:06:09,563
Oh.

53
00:06:09,565 --> 00:06:10,530
Fine, whoever.

54
00:06:10,532 --> 00:06:12,398
She's a good investigator.

55
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:12,865
Good.

56
00:06:12,867 --> 00:06:15,033
As far as the matter
of a retainer...

57
00:06:15,035 --> 00:06:18,276
Oh. Just bill me whatever
you think is fair.

58
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,766
<i>Keeping something out or in?</i>

59
00:06:50,768 --> 00:06:52,868
My eyes are very
sensitive to light.

60
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,437
Don't they have a vitamin
for that or something?

61
00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:00,008
Why do you want your husband
investigated, Mrs. Farrow-Smith?

62
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:04,312
I want to know if he's
fucking someone else.

63
00:07:05,114 --> 00:07:07,781
You have any reason
to believe that he is?

64
00:07:07,783 --> 00:07:10,150
Only a too-keen memory.

65
00:07:12,587 --> 00:07:12,985
Memory?

66
00:07:12,987 --> 00:07:18,924
I remember what he was like when
it was still new between us.

67
00:07:18,926 --> 00:07:24,663
My husband requires a certain
freshness to the feel of things.

68
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:28,199
The need for a conquest?

69
00:07:28,201 --> 00:07:31,502
We're attracted to men
of power and vitality.

70
00:07:31,504 --> 00:07:32,603
And those are
the very qualities

71
00:07:32,605 --> 00:07:35,572
that make them
impossible to hold on to.

72
00:07:35,574 --> 00:07:37,674
"We," Mrs. Farrow-Smith?

73
00:07:39,411 --> 00:07:40,743
You married?

74
00:07:40,745 --> 00:07:43,345
No, I most certainly am not.

75
00:07:43,347 --> 00:07:46,247
But you are.
Tell me about your husband.

76
00:07:46,249 --> 00:07:47,648
Do you have anything tangible?

77
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:50,751
Any strange hours,
phone calls at night?

78
00:07:50,753 --> 00:07:52,085
He's too smart.

79
00:07:52,087 --> 00:07:54,053
Have you come out
and asked him?

80
00:07:54,055 --> 00:07:55,421
I'm too smart.

81
00:07:55,423 --> 00:07:56,822
I quit.

82
00:07:56,824 --> 00:08:01,026
You know, some women just
choose to look the other way.

83
00:08:03,997 --> 00:08:05,463
Are you trying to deter me?

84
00:08:05,465 --> 00:08:09,200
Are you sure you can handle
what it is I find out?

85
00:08:09,202 --> 00:08:12,903
Do I look like the type
who would fold on you?

86
00:08:13,205 --> 00:08:14,337
I really can't say.

87
00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:17,840
What I do require is
absolute confidentiality.

88
00:08:17,842 --> 00:08:22,945
Being a fool is one thing. A
public fool is quite another.

89
00:08:22,947 --> 00:08:23,979
I understand.

90
00:08:23,981 --> 00:08:27,682
Whatever records
you keep, no copies.

91
00:08:27,684 --> 00:08:30,551
Everything's for my eyes only.

92
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,053
Did Max explain the charges?

93
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:38,491
Whatever it is, I'm sure it'll
be worth my peace of mind.

94
00:08:38,593 --> 00:08:41,327
If that's what you're buying.

95
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:12,024
How do you always know where to find
me when I don't want to be found?

96
00:09:12,026 --> 00:09:15,460
I think it's a detective
kind of thing.

97
00:09:15,595 --> 00:09:16,727
Mmm.

98
00:09:16,729 --> 00:09:17,427
Thanks for coming.

99
00:09:17,429 --> 00:09:19,295
Is the term "happy hour"
in your vocabulary?

100
00:09:19,297 --> 00:09:20,929
It depends what
you mean by "happy."

101
00:09:20,931 --> 00:09:24,098
Can you spell double
Scotch on the rocks?

102
00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:26,733
Let's get a move on.

103
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:37,434
<i>I have to get rid of the scum.</i>

104
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:40,203
<i>They clutter up this city,</i>

105
00:10:40,271 --> 00:10:43,138
<i>ruining every day for me.</i>

106
00:10:44,074 --> 00:10:46,274
<i>I hate them all.</i>

107
00:10:46,276 --> 00:10:48,909
<i>I pass by them on the street.</i>

108
00:10:48,911 --> 00:10:53,747
<i>I made a commitment to myself</i>
<i>to kill everybody.</i>

109
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,850
<i>I have a couple of days</i>

110
00:10:58,853 --> 00:11:01,720
<i>to clear the streets</i>

111
00:11:01,822 --> 00:11:03,988
<i>for nice people.</i>

112
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:43,226
We're talking clear from A
Street to the river, yeah?

113
00:11:43,228 --> 00:11:44,126
We got that franchise?

114
00:11:44,128 --> 00:11:47,596
Your people won't even get
so much as a parking ticket.

115
00:11:47,598 --> 00:11:50,365
It's comforting to know the
tradition of cops having a price

116
00:11:50,367 --> 00:11:52,367
is alive and well in this city.

117
00:11:52,369 --> 00:11:54,202
Oh, yeah.

118
00:11:54,637 --> 00:11:56,069
Just one more thing.

119
00:11:56,071 --> 00:11:57,136
What's that?

120
00:11:57,138 --> 00:11:58,804
Take off your shirt.

121
00:11:58,806 --> 00:11:59,704
What are you talking about?

122
00:11:59,706 --> 00:12:01,939
Maybe I got
a thing for nipples.

123
00:12:01,941 --> 00:12:03,140
That's bullshit, man!

124
00:12:03,142 --> 00:12:05,008
Sit down. Get off!

125
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:06,809
Shut up and show me
you're not wired.

126
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:08,877
Carl, you don't
have to do this.

127
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:10,778
I told you I know his people.

128
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,814
Come on, let's see
you're not broadcasting.

129
00:12:20,022 --> 00:12:21,321
Did your gun jam?

130
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,056
Carl! Put the gun down.

131
00:12:23,058 --> 00:12:24,724
You kill a cop,
you're looking at

132
00:12:24,726 --> 00:12:26,459
a real fucking
reduction in lifestyle.

133
00:12:26,461 --> 00:12:27,827
I don't believe you.

134
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:28,928
Put the gun down, Carl.

135
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:32,231
You got the best lawyer in town.
You can skip on this.

136
00:12:32,233 --> 00:12:36,735
Don't throw your life away. Put the gun down!
Do you hear me?

137
00:12:36,737 --> 00:12:38,670
Carl, put it down.

138
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,705
Put that gun down, Carl.

139
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:55,518
Fuck!

140
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:03,726
Jesus, Ray, it looked like she
might have been defusing it.

141
00:13:03,728 --> 00:13:06,829
"Might have."
Couldn't take that chance.

142
00:13:06,831 --> 00:13:12,301
Besides, he was lined up
real nice in the crosshairs.

143
00:13:12,703 --> 00:13:15,136
Good shot. Let's go.

144
00:13:33,987 --> 00:13:37,755
<i>¶ Falling in so far</i>

145
00:13:40,092 --> 00:13:46,329
<i>¶ Looking up because</i>
<i>we're headed away</i>

146
00:13:46,331 --> 00:13:49,198
<i>¶ We are</i>

00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,642
<i>¶ And holding on too much.</i>

149
00:14:01,945 --> 00:14:04,712
What can I get you?

150
00:14:05,047 --> 00:14:09,949
<i>¶ I can remember how we were</i>

151
00:14:11,819 --> 00:14:13,185
<i>¶ Then</i>

152
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:17,622
<i>¶ You know that everything</i>
<i>will be all right.</i>

153
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:21,892
She's got quite the voice, huh?

154
00:14:22,327 --> 00:14:23,460
Yeah.

155
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:24,961
What do you think
it is that separates

156
00:14:24,963 --> 00:14:27,463
the ones that make it
from the ones that don't?

157
00:14:27,465 --> 00:14:29,198
Timing.

158
00:14:29,867 --> 00:14:30,432
That's it.

159
00:14:30,434 --> 00:14:32,467
I mean, just think of all
those pompous assholes

160
00:14:32,469 --> 00:14:35,503
who take everything from
life as if they've earned it

161
00:14:35,505 --> 00:14:36,570
when all that's really happened

162
00:14:36,572 --> 00:14:39,673
is they weren't
where the bullets hit.

163
00:14:40,942 --> 00:14:41,907
What do you do for a living?

164
00:14:41,909 --> 00:14:45,310
Medical electronics. Sales rep.

165
00:14:45,312 --> 00:14:46,311
That's interesting.

166
00:14:46,313 --> 00:14:50,882
Have you noticed that's all
anybody talks about these days?

167
00:14:50,884 --> 00:14:53,818
Violence, guns, death.

168
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,652
Just making conversation.

169
00:14:54,654 --> 00:14:57,588
But you just met me, and already
you're talking about bullets.

170
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:03,627
Whatever happened to rides in the
country, picnics, cotton candy?

171
00:15:03,795 --> 00:15:06,595
You want to go get
some cotton candy?

172
00:15:08,298 --> 00:15:10,531
No. Not with you.

173
00:15:10,533 --> 00:15:13,700
<i>¶ I realize</i>

174
00:15:13,802 --> 00:15:17,837

00:16:56,401 --> 00:16:59,001
<i>Hi. It's Derian McCall.</i>

179
00:16:59,503 --> 00:17:00,101
Ah.

180
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:02,570
So, it all looks really
like business to me,

181
00:17:02,572 --> 00:17:04,572
and now he's in
his office alone.

182
00:17:04,574 --> 00:17:09,643
Yes. Well, no one ever accused
Michael of not being a workaholic.

183
00:17:09,645 --> 00:17:13,546
Yeah. Well, in this case,
that might be a good thing.

184
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:16,548
So...

185
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:20,350
What do you think
of my husband so far?

186
00:17:21,353 --> 00:17:22,051
What do you mean?

187
00:17:22,053 --> 00:17:24,686
Michael's the kind of man
who leaves an impression.

188
00:17:24,688 --> 00:17:29,223
I'm hired to make observations,
Mrs. Farrow-Smith,

189
00:17:29,225 --> 00:17:30,657
not give reviews.

190
00:17:32,627 --> 00:17:34,593
The observer and the observed.

191
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:39,598
Perhaps his charm works
better at closer distances.

192
00:17:39,967 --> 00:17:41,032
I wouldn't know.

193
00:17:41,034 --> 00:17:45,403
<i>You don't even know yet</i>
<i>why I married him, do you?</i>

194
00:17:50,343 --> 00:17:55,412
Actually, what I can't figure
out is why he married you.

195
00:18:20,772 --> 00:18:23,739
My gut tells me this is
all I'm going to find.

196
00:18:23,741 --> 00:18:26,308
The only woman that came
within any proximity

197
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,609
of your husband was this one.

198
00:18:27,611 --> 00:18:31,279
But they were then
joined by this man.

199
00:18:31,581 --> 00:18:34,715
That would be
Susan and Bill Novick.

200
00:18:34,717 --> 00:18:39,186
My husband's been courting their
money for the past six months.

201
00:18:40,556 --> 00:18:42,556
You sound disappointed.

202
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:45,759
Did you ever wake up in
the middle of the night

203
00:18:47,062 --> 00:18:48,928
and think you hear rats?

204
00:18:50,164 --> 00:18:51,596
But you still can't
get back to sleep.

205
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:56,834
I wouldn't have thought you would
have much experience with rats.

206
00:18:57,403 --> 00:18:59,903
I may surprise you yet.

207
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:02,572
I'd like to keep you
on retainer.

208
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:06,342
Listen, honestly, I can
spend a lot of your money

209
00:19:06,344 --> 00:19:07,776
following your husband around.

210
00:19:07,778 --> 00:19:10,879
I don't want you to follow him.

211
00:19:11,848 --> 00:19:13,781
What do you want?

212
00:19:13,983 --> 00:19:16,183
I'll never really be certain

213
00:19:16,185 --> 00:19:20,987
until I see how he reacts
to the right temptation.

214
00:19:25,459 --> 00:19:29,694
This was it from the
beginning, wasn't it?

215
00:19:29,796 --> 00:19:32,730
I just spent a week
spinning my wheels.

216
00:19:32,732 --> 00:19:33,764
You're the only one
who can do it.

217
00:19:33,766 --> 00:19:35,866
I'm sorry, but I think you
might be in the market

218
00:19:35,868 --> 00:19:38,602
for a different type
of professional service.

219
00:19:38,604 --> 00:19:44,174
I'm just talking about a
little harmless flirtation.

220
00:19:44,176 --> 00:19:45,074
It's a test.

221
00:19:45,076 --> 00:19:47,876
It's the only way that
I'll ever know for sure

222
00:19:47,878 --> 00:19:51,446
that I can trust him,
that's all.

223
00:19:51,848 --> 00:19:54,915
It's not really part
of my job description.

224
00:19:54,917 --> 00:19:57,550
I'll double your salary.

225
00:20:01,389 --> 00:20:02,955
Help me.

226
00:20:07,895 --> 00:20:09,628
I need you.

227
00:20:11,097 --> 00:20:14,364
Legally this would be considered entrapment.
You know that.

228
00:20:14,366 --> 00:20:17,867
It's got nothing
to do with the law.

229
00:20:21,105 --> 00:20:22,938
All right.

230
00:20:23,073 --> 00:20:25,640
As far as anyone knows,
this is a straight

231
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:28,175
watch and follow,
Mrs. Farrow-Smith.

232
00:20:28,177 --> 00:20:33,079
I think, Derian, that when
one woman asks another woman

233
00:20:33,081 --> 00:20:36,082
to try to seduce her husband,

234
00:20:36,551 --> 00:20:39,485
first names are in order.

235
00:20:46,126 --> 00:20:48,092
Set?

236
00:20:52,498 --> 00:20:54,464
I'll whack you.

237
00:21:15,985 --> 00:21:18,385
That was a good one.

238
00:21:18,387 --> 00:21:19,085
Wednesday?

239
00:21:19,087 --> 00:21:20,853
Talk to me after my bypass.

240
00:21:20,855 --> 00:21:21,987
You got time for a drink?

241
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:25,523
I think I'm going to
hit the weight room.

242
00:21:25,525 --> 00:21:26,891
Lift a couple for me.

243
00:21:26,893 --> 00:21:27,758
You got it.

244
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,292
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

245
00:21:29,294 --> 00:21:31,427
All right. Take care. Okay.

246
00:21:31,429 --> 00:21:33,295
Great game.

247
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:44,570
Oh!

248
00:21:44,572 --> 00:21:46,305
I'm sorry. It's my fault.
Are you all right?

249
00:21:46,307 --> 00:21:49,875
I'm going to kill someone if I don't
start watching where I'm going.

250
00:21:49,877 --> 00:21:53,211
You didn't happen to see a
dark-haired girl, short, curly hair?

251
00:21:53,213 --> 00:21:54,912
No. You lost your partner?

252
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:56,280
Today's Tuesday, right?

253
00:21:56,282 --> 00:21:57,381
All day.

254
00:21:57,383 --> 00:22:01,918
Oh. I bet she said
Thursday. Shoot!

255
00:22:02,887 --> 00:22:03,819
Good luck.

256
00:22:03,821 --> 00:22:05,854
Thanks. Yeah.

257
00:22:19,903 --> 00:22:23,838
Hey! It would be a shame
to waste a reserved court.

258
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,906
I'm not that good anyway.

259
00:22:25,908 --> 00:22:28,174
That's all right.

260
00:22:29,377 --> 00:22:30,709
I am.

261
00:22:38,752 --> 00:22:40,551
<i>¶ Never</i>

262
00:22:46,425 --> 00:22:48,224
<i>¶ Never</i>

263
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:55,697
<i>¶ Never gonna fall</i>

264
00:22:57,067 --> 00:23:00,034
<i>¶ Never gonna fall</i>

265
00:23:00,236 --> 00:23:04,071
<i>¶ Never gonna</i>
<i>fall in love again</i>

266
00:23:04,073 --> 00:23:08,708
<i>¶ Never gonna</i>
<i>fall in love again</i>

267
00:23:09,277 --> 00:23:11,644
<i>¶ Never</i>

268
00:23:15,716 --> 00:23:20,752
<i>¶ Now you want me ¶</i>

269
00:23:22,021 --> 00:23:22,786
Are you okay?

270
00:23:22,788 --> 00:23:26,189
Fine. Looks like
our hour is up anyway.

271
00:23:26,191 --> 00:23:28,124
Yeah. Here.

272
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:29,991
Thanks.

273
00:23:29,993 --> 00:23:31,826
It was fun playing
above my level.

274
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:34,862
It's the only way to learn.

275
00:23:36,065 --> 00:23:37,397
Drink? Loser buys?

276
00:23:37,399 --> 00:23:39,565
No, I've got
a rush hour to beat.

277
00:23:39,567 --> 00:23:42,901
But next time you lose your
partner, please look me up.

278
00:23:42,903 --> 00:23:45,136
I'd like to play. I enjoyed it.

279
00:23:45,138 --> 00:23:46,270
Great. Thanks.

280
00:23:46,272 --> 00:23:48,272
Thanks. Bye.

281
00:23:57,249 --> 00:23:58,615
I don't think he's interested.

282
00:23:58,617 --> 00:24:00,316
<i>Maybe you need to try harder.</i>

283
00:24:00,318 --> 00:24:03,886
Michael's very perceptive. If
anything is off, he'll notice.

284
00:24:03,888 --> 00:24:05,554
Even the slightest thing.

285
00:24:05,556 --> 00:24:07,188
<i>You have to be flawless.</i>

286
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,355
Maybe I'm not his type.

287
00:24:08,357 --> 00:24:10,423
<i>Yes, you are.</i>

288
00:24:10,425 --> 00:24:13,659
<i>Believe me, I know my husband.
You're his type.</i>

289
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:16,261
I don't know how comfortable
I am with this.

290
00:24:16,263 --> 00:24:19,564
With Michael, it gets easier.

291
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:21,999
<i>What if after all</i>
<i>this there is nothing?</i>

292
00:24:22,001 --> 00:24:24,935
<i>Are you going to be</i>
<i>happy with that?</i>

293
00:24:24,937 --> 00:24:27,370
Do you think it's
possible for any of us

294
00:24:27,372 --> 00:24:30,139
to resist the right temptation?

295
00:24:33,344 --> 00:24:34,676
I really can't say.

296
00:24:34,678 --> 00:24:38,813
You don't know how much
I need you to find out.

297
00:24:49,692 --> 00:24:51,324
Shots twenty.

298
00:24:51,326 --> 00:24:53,426
Okay, guys, party's over.

299
00:24:53,428 --> 00:24:54,727
All right. See you later.

300
00:24:54,729 --> 00:24:57,729
I'm serious. Get the
fuck out of here.

301
00:25:13,113 --> 00:25:15,346
I just have to go do something.

302
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:18,415
Yeah? Yeah. I'll
just be right back.

303
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:34,297
Derian McCall
for Mr. Farrow-Smith.

304
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:35,798
She says she has
something for him.

305
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,868
He left it at
the racquetball court.

306
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,370
It'll be one moment.

307
00:25:52,683 --> 00:25:53,948
Hi.

308
00:25:56,118 --> 00:25:57,117
Hi.

309
00:25:57,119 --> 00:25:59,853
It must've popped out of
your bag when I tripped.

310
00:25:59,855 --> 00:26:01,855
By the time I saw it,
you were gone.

311
00:26:01,857 --> 00:26:05,258
My God, I've been looking
for this for two days.

312
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:08,361
You have keen eyes.
I'm glad you found it.

313
00:26:08,363 --> 00:26:10,196
Thank you.

314
00:26:12,633 --> 00:26:14,366
Nice view.

315
00:26:15,669 --> 00:26:17,468
It's something, isn't it?

316
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:21,204
I put myself through
college driving a taxicab.

317
00:26:21,206 --> 00:26:25,274
I spent my life down there in the
filth and the heat and the traffic.

318
00:26:25,276 --> 00:26:27,175
I promised myself
if I ever made it,

319
00:26:27,177 --> 00:26:29,644
I'd get as far away
from that as possible.

320
00:26:29,646 --> 00:26:31,212
When I got up here,

321
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:33,314
everything just
started to make sense.

322
00:26:33,316 --> 00:26:37,217
From here, you can view
the world at a distance.

323
00:26:37,219 --> 00:26:39,786
I don't need much else,

324
00:26:39,888 --> 00:26:40,786
not even a watch.

325
00:26:40,788 --> 00:26:44,289
You should take better care
of your valuable things.

326
00:26:44,291 --> 00:26:48,226
I have been told that before.
Please, come sit down.

327
00:26:51,331 --> 00:26:51,762
Looks old.

328
00:26:51,764 --> 00:26:56,199
My father gave it to me after
I graduated high school.

329
00:26:56,734 --> 00:26:57,566
It's supposed to be lucky.

330
00:26:57,568 --> 00:27:01,303
It seems to have worked.
You got your view.

331
00:27:01,305 --> 00:27:04,406
I don't remember
giving you my last name.

332
00:27:04,408 --> 00:27:05,907
How did you find me?

333
00:27:05,909 --> 00:27:06,574
I recognized your face.

334
00:27:06,576 --> 00:27:09,343
I've seen you on the financial
page a couple of times.

335
00:27:09,345 --> 00:27:13,280
That's funny. You don't strike
me as a financial page type.

336
00:27:13,282 --> 00:27:15,215
It's just something
to read when I'm stuck

337
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:18,084
down there in the traffic
and the filth.

338
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:20,853
Well, it's not very often

339
00:27:20,855 --> 00:27:24,456
that someone goes to so much
trouble for a perfect stranger.

340
00:27:24,458 --> 00:27:26,691
It wasn't that much trouble.

341
00:27:26,693 --> 00:27:28,426
Nonetheless, I feel like

342
00:27:28,428 --> 00:27:31,328
I want to give you some
kind of a reward, but...

343
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:35,165
Something tells you
I wouldn't take it?

344
00:27:37,702 --> 00:27:39,768
Well, would you?

345
00:27:40,537 --> 00:27:41,969
No.

346
00:27:44,473 --> 00:27:46,773
Well, I better be going.

347
00:27:48,042 --> 00:27:48,540
Um...

348
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:51,509
Well, maybe at least
I could buy you a drink.

349
00:27:51,511 --> 00:27:54,311
We're back to talking "reward"?

350
00:27:54,446 --> 00:27:55,845
No.

351
00:27:55,847 --> 00:27:59,548
I would just simply
like to buy you a drink.

352
00:28:03,487 --> 00:28:06,888
I'll meet you back here at 8:00.
How's that?

353
00:28:08,658 --> 00:28:10,491
Bye. Bye.

354
00:28:28,711 --> 00:28:31,945
Let's see now, I forget.
Who owes who?

355
00:28:31,947 --> 00:28:34,614
Don't give me shit, Falco.

356
00:28:35,016 --> 00:28:37,182
Did you make the call?

357
00:28:37,184 --> 00:28:39,450
Yeah, Mr. Wall Street, right?

358
00:28:39,452 --> 00:28:40,784
Did you find anything?

359
00:28:40,786 --> 00:28:43,820
Let's see. Here we go.

360
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:47,789
Well, like we knew,
he's dick-deep

361
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:49,857
in other people's money,
that's for sure.

362
00:28:49,859 --> 00:28:51,259
He buys, sells,
and takes his cut.

363
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:54,127
High stakes shit. But as far
as anyone downtown knows,

364
00:28:54,129 --> 00:28:57,096
he's done nothing that'll pop
a woody on Mike Wallace.

365
00:28:57,098 --> 00:28:58,464
Why are you interested?

366
00:28:58,466 --> 00:29:00,332
I'm doing a marital on the guy.

367
00:29:00,334 --> 00:29:02,734
Well, I've got a call
to Maryanne with the Feds.

368
00:29:02,736 --> 00:29:05,837
She'll let me know
if he doesn't squeak.

369
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:09,340
Thanks, Falco.
I really appreciate it.

370
00:29:10,876 --> 00:29:13,776
Hey, you were
a good cop, you know?

371
00:29:13,778 --> 00:29:17,146
What the hell are you doing
following cheating husbands around?

372
00:29:17,148 --> 00:29:19,848
It pays the light bill.
What can I tell you?

373
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:21,816
You're doing all right, huh?

374
00:29:23,685 --> 00:29:26,786
I'm doing okay, yeah.

375
00:29:27,221 --> 00:29:30,889
Derian, I was always
on your side.

376
00:29:30,891 --> 00:29:35,393
You just walked away too soon.
You could have made it.

377
00:29:37,063 --> 00:29:38,896
Made what?

378
00:30:32,984 --> 00:30:35,484
I wouldn't have thought this
would be your kind of place.

379
00:30:35,486 --> 00:30:39,221
Well, I stopped having my
shirts stuffed a few years ago.

380
00:30:39,223 --> 00:30:41,022
That's not what I meant.

381
00:30:41,024 --> 00:30:42,790
Of course it is.

382
00:30:42,792 --> 00:30:47,027
I started coming here
when I was going to college.

383
00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:48,762
Business school?

384
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:50,597
Medicine.

385
00:30:52,033 --> 00:30:53,298
Really?

386
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,866
No shit.

387
00:30:56,135 --> 00:30:57,901
What happened?

388
00:30:58,403 --> 00:31:00,603
Everybody seemed to be
into it for the money.

389
00:31:00,605 --> 00:31:03,639
And all they ever talked
about was stock options.

390
00:31:03,641 --> 00:31:05,907
So I decided to
cut out the middleman.

391
00:31:07,343 --> 00:31:08,675
And you?

392
00:31:09,577 --> 00:31:11,443
I...

393
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,546
I was a cop.

394
00:31:16,515 --> 00:31:17,180
You're kidding.

395
00:31:17,182 --> 00:31:19,649
On the job four years
and two months.

396
00:31:19,651 --> 00:31:20,216
You're serious.

397
00:31:20,218 --> 00:31:22,985
I just wasn't very good at it.

398
00:31:23,153 --> 00:31:24,986
Bullshit.

399
00:31:25,755 --> 00:31:29,723
So what did you work?

400
00:31:30,092 --> 00:31:31,658
Vice.

401
00:31:32,293 --> 00:31:33,925
Undercover.

402
00:31:36,362 --> 00:31:38,328
Why did you quit?

403
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:42,765
I don't know you
well enough to say.

404
00:31:43,667 --> 00:31:44,966
Fair enough.

405
00:31:44,968 --> 00:31:47,201
So what do you do now?

406
00:31:47,203 --> 00:31:48,802
Insurance claims.

407
00:31:48,804 --> 00:31:52,205
It's not that different
from police work, really.

408
00:31:52,207 --> 00:31:55,641
A little legwork,
a lot of paperwork.

409
00:32:00,981 --> 00:32:03,181
I'm married.

410
00:32:03,183 --> 00:32:05,550
I just wanted to let you know.

411
00:32:05,552 --> 00:32:09,153
I didn't want to give you
the wrong impression.

412
00:32:20,099 --> 00:32:22,232
Well, I'm single,

413
00:32:23,635 --> 00:32:25,434
for what it's worth.

414
00:32:28,439 --> 00:32:31,973
It's not that I have
a perfect marriage.

415
00:32:31,975 --> 00:32:33,908
Far from it.

416
00:32:35,044 --> 00:32:37,210
But I don't cheat.

417
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:40,813
And I didn't
want you to think...

418
00:32:40,815 --> 00:32:44,483
Would you excuse me
for a moment?

419
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:18,683
<i>I would just simply</i>
<i>like to buy you a drink.</i>

420
00:33:18,685 --> 00:33:21,585
<i>I'm single,</i>
<i>for what it's worth.</i>

421
00:33:21,587 --> 00:33:24,487
<i>I don't believe you.</i>

422
00:33:30,795 --> 00:33:33,962
I've just have to
go do something.

423
00:33:45,842 --> 00:33:47,741
Damn, she pulled the wire.

424
00:33:48,076 --> 00:33:49,875
Not again.

425
00:33:58,085 --> 00:34:00,251
The signal's dead.

426
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:31,381
I'm addicted to
everything about you.

427
00:34:58,009 --> 00:35:01,310
<i>You can't let it get to you.</i>

428
00:35:06,917 --> 00:35:08,416
Are you okay?

429
00:35:08,418 --> 00:35:09,283
Sure.

430
00:35:09,285 --> 00:35:12,552
You haven't said much
since we left.

431
00:35:12,554 --> 00:35:14,554
I guess I'm just tired.

432
00:35:15,423 --> 00:35:16,455
Come on!

433
00:35:16,457 --> 00:35:17,989
What the hell?

434
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:33,303
What are you doing?

435
00:35:33,972 --> 00:35:36,205
Hold him! Hold him down!

436
00:35:36,207 --> 00:35:38,106
Light him up, man.

437
00:35:38,108 --> 00:35:39,307
Spark him up.

438
00:35:39,309 --> 00:35:41,575
I'll be right back.

439
00:35:48,951 --> 00:35:50,250
Get the fuck out of here!

440
00:35:50,252 --> 00:35:53,386
Why don't you mind
your own business, asshole?

441
00:35:53,388 --> 00:35:53,986
Let him go.

442
00:35:53,988 --> 00:35:56,455
You want to fuck with me? Huh?

443
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:17,339
Get the fuck out!

444
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:20,308
You all right?

445
00:36:20,476 --> 00:36:21,041
Hey! Hey!

446
00:36:21,043 --> 00:36:26,046
I just want to help.
I just want to help!

447
00:36:30,018 --> 00:36:32,718
What the fuck is
wrong with people?

448
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:38,556
It was a gang initiation.

449
00:36:38,925 --> 00:36:39,957
Gang initiation?

450
00:36:39,959 --> 00:36:43,660
They got to kill
somebody to get in.

451
00:36:49,267 --> 00:36:52,234
Let's get out of here. Come on.

452
00:36:55,105 --> 00:36:56,737
Poor guy.

453
00:37:06,315 --> 00:37:08,615
Are you all right?

454
00:37:09,284 --> 00:37:12,184
It scared the shit out of me.

455
00:37:13,086 --> 00:37:15,653
You didn't look scared.

456
00:37:15,755 --> 00:37:16,687
No?

457
00:37:16,689 --> 00:37:17,721
It didn't seem to stop you.

458
00:37:17,723 --> 00:37:22,158
Yeah, well, it helps not having enough
time to consider one's options.

459
00:37:23,261 --> 00:37:25,294
I think that's what
defines us as people.

460
00:37:25,296 --> 00:37:27,996
How you react when there's
no time to think, you know?

461
00:37:27,998 --> 00:37:34,535
A couple seconds either way, everything
would be different for all of us.

462
00:37:34,537 --> 00:37:36,770
Jesus Christ!

463
00:37:36,772 --> 00:37:40,540
It was so stupid
getting out of the car.

464
00:37:41,276 --> 00:37:42,842
I'm sorry.

465
00:37:44,278 --> 00:37:45,310
Goddamn it.

466
00:37:45,312 --> 00:37:47,545
You saved that guy's life.

467
00:37:57,223 --> 00:37:58,388
I'll walk you in.

468
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:00,223
It's like 10 feet away.

469
00:38:00,225 --> 00:38:01,824
Please.

470
00:38:12,469 --> 00:38:14,702
Thanks for the drink.

471
00:38:15,738 --> 00:38:19,740
I really think it was
brave, what you did.

472
00:38:19,742 --> 00:38:23,543
Well, it certainly was
an exciting night.

473
00:38:25,513 --> 00:38:27,012
About what I said at the bar...

474
00:38:27,014 --> 00:38:28,413
No, you don't have to.

475
00:38:28,415 --> 00:38:31,582
Please, I would like to.

476
00:38:31,884 --> 00:38:35,051
A lot of times, I wish
things were different.

477
00:38:35,053 --> 00:38:37,319
But they're not.

478
00:38:37,387 --> 00:38:38,853
So...

479
00:38:38,955 --> 00:38:39,586
Yeah.

480
00:38:39,588 --> 00:38:43,856
You better watch out. They tow
here in two seconds flat.

481
00:38:43,858 --> 00:38:46,992
Right. Thanks for the tip.

482
00:38:46,994 --> 00:38:48,193
I had a great time.

483
00:38:48,195 --> 00:38:49,694
Me, too.

484
00:38:51,431 --> 00:38:52,763
Bye.

485
00:39:48,151 --> 00:39:52,653
You've been cooped up all day.
You want to go out, don't you?

486
00:39:53,822 --> 00:39:55,588
Come on.

487
00:40:03,064 --> 00:40:04,596
Here we go.

488
00:40:04,598 --> 00:40:07,365
Just what I wanted to do.

489
00:40:07,867 --> 00:40:09,600
Okay.

490
00:42:32,443 --> 00:42:33,942
Don't you eat?

491
00:42:33,944 --> 00:42:36,577
You get skinnier
every time I see you.

492
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:40,013
I eat, Max.

493
00:42:41,149 --> 00:42:44,116
Mr. Farrow-Smith getting any?

494
00:42:45,986 --> 00:42:49,821
The Farrow-Smith case?
What's the status?

495
00:42:50,323 --> 00:42:52,356
Oh, there's...

496
00:42:53,125 --> 00:42:53,823
There's nothing there.

497
00:42:53,825 --> 00:42:56,625
You found the only faithful
husband in America.

498
00:42:56,627 --> 00:42:57,692
I'll alert the media.

499
00:42:57,694 --> 00:42:58,793
I'm closing it out today. Good.

500
00:42:58,795 --> 00:43:01,362
I got a missing kid on
hold, probably a runaway,

501
00:43:01,364 --> 00:43:04,865
but his parents
work for the UN.

502
00:43:06,068 --> 00:43:07,300
Are you hearing this?

503
00:43:07,302 --> 00:43:09,368
Yeah. Yeah.

504
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:13,605
Good. Close out
Farrow-Smith and you're up.

505
00:43:21,448 --> 00:43:25,016
Michael didn't
come home last night.

506
00:43:25,018 --> 00:43:27,084
I know.

507
00:43:28,087 --> 00:43:28,919
Did you...

508
00:43:28,921 --> 00:43:31,154
You got what you wanted.

509
00:43:33,525 --> 00:43:34,824
Did you get what you wanted?

510
00:43:34,826 --> 00:43:36,592
Don't play that with me.

511
00:43:36,594 --> 00:43:37,693
This was your manipulation.

512
00:43:37,695 --> 00:43:42,230
As I recall, the idea was
to tempt him, not fuck him.

513
00:43:43,733 --> 00:43:45,132
Was it?

514
00:43:45,868 --> 00:43:48,835
You have to tell me everything.
What was he like?

515
00:43:48,837 --> 00:43:50,036
Tell you everything?

516
00:43:50,038 --> 00:43:51,437
Yes. Don't you see?

517
00:43:51,439 --> 00:43:53,872
Now I know what
he's capable of.

518
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:56,974
This is how you get
your kicks, isn't it?

519
00:43:56,976 --> 00:43:59,843
You were hired to do a job.

520
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:03,179
Unless it's become personal.

521
00:44:04,749 --> 00:44:06,815
Oh, well, I think
there's some things

522
00:44:06,817 --> 00:44:09,117
you need to know
about my husband.

523
00:44:09,486 --> 00:44:10,351
He's not what he seems.

524
00:44:10,353 --> 00:44:14,388
I'm through with both of
you and your game playing.

525
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:15,088
What about his games?

526
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:16,722
You think you're going
to be able to leave him

527
00:44:16,724 --> 00:44:19,558
now that you've let him in?

528
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,493
Just watch me.

529
00:44:23,897 --> 00:44:26,464
Derian! Wait! Wait!

530
00:44:26,532 --> 00:44:30,300
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I lied, all right?

531
00:44:30,935 --> 00:44:31,934
I did want you to follow him,

532
00:44:31,936 --> 00:44:34,202
but I wasn't manipulating you.

533
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:37,705
What do you think? You think I
want you to sleep with my husband?

534
00:44:37,707 --> 00:44:40,774
The truth is, I thought
that in following him

535
00:44:40,776 --> 00:44:42,475
you'd uncover
his business deals

536
00:44:42,477 --> 00:44:43,876
and the people
that he's involved with.

537
00:44:43,878 --> 00:44:45,277
What are you talking about?

538
00:44:45,279 --> 00:44:49,281
He's gotten involved in some
high-risk transactions.

539
00:44:49,283 --> 00:44:53,318
And I'm scared of the people
that he's dealing with.

540
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,652
Oh, shit!

541
00:44:54,654 --> 00:44:56,420
Everything is
spinning out of control

542
00:44:56,422 --> 00:45:00,590
and he's become violent,
and he hit me.

543
00:45:00,592 --> 00:45:03,893
Michael doesn't seem like the
kind of guy to hit a woman.

544
00:45:03,895 --> 00:45:06,028
Excuse me. Could I have
a little seniority here?

545
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:09,031
I think I know my husband
better than you do.

546
00:45:09,366 --> 00:45:14,202
I'm afraid that both Michael and
I are going to end up dead.

547
00:45:14,204 --> 00:45:18,706
And I need you. I need you
to stay close to him.

548
00:45:18,708 --> 00:45:21,141
I need you to find out
what's going on

549
00:45:21,143 --> 00:45:23,977
so that I can get us out of it.

550
00:45:27,382 --> 00:45:30,282
Does Michael know
you put me on to him?

551
00:45:30,284 --> 00:45:32,050
No. Are you... No!

552
00:45:32,052 --> 00:45:36,320
And I'm sorry I lied,
I really am. I just...

553
00:45:36,455 --> 00:45:39,155
I didn't know what to do.

554
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:40,989
I'm scared.

555
00:47:09,712 --> 00:47:12,512
Jake Halstead.
Real estate maven.

556
00:47:12,514 --> 00:47:14,747
Disappeared about
three years ago.

557
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:16,348
We figure he's
playing goldfish tag

558
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:19,718
right about now
with Jimmy Hoffa.

559
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:20,885
He was in bed with
your boy for a while.

560
00:47:20,887 --> 00:47:24,889
They were connected through a
series of holding companies.

561
00:47:24,891 --> 00:47:26,624
Nominally legal, of course.

562
00:47:26,626 --> 00:47:28,325
And then when
Halstead disappeared,

563
00:47:28,327 --> 00:47:30,627
he also disappeared
with a shit load of money

564
00:47:30,629 --> 00:47:31,728
formerly in the possession of

565
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:34,230
some seniors in
the Boca Raton area.

566
00:47:34,232 --> 00:47:36,232
And of course
they wound up with

567
00:47:36,234 --> 00:47:40,336
a nice piece of
alligator hunting ground.

568
00:47:41,672 --> 00:47:46,041
Halstead disappears
and Farrow-Smith prospers.

569
00:47:46,043 --> 00:47:48,977
The guy lands
on his feet every time.

570
00:47:48,979 --> 00:47:53,481
Right now his company is under
investigation by Justice.

571
00:47:53,483 --> 00:47:53,914
For what?

572
00:47:53,916 --> 00:47:56,616
Well, ostensibly, he's still
involved in real estate.

573
00:47:56,618 --> 00:48:00,119
I mean, he buys down
and sells up.

574
00:48:00,721 --> 00:48:06,691
But he's been involved with
some guys in organized crime,

575
00:48:06,959 --> 00:48:09,726
and we really think that he's
using the realty company

576
00:48:09,728 --> 00:48:12,595
as a front for
a money laundering operation.

577
00:48:12,597 --> 00:48:15,230
Do you have any evidence?

578
00:48:15,232 --> 00:48:17,966
Do I have any evidence? Yeah.

579
00:48:17,968 --> 00:48:20,401
A little inference

580
00:48:20,403 --> 00:48:23,070
and a lot of gut feeling.

581
00:48:25,707 --> 00:48:28,007
Which is why
I want to talk to you.

582
00:48:28,509 --> 00:48:31,409
I mean, you're already
on the inside.

583
00:48:31,411 --> 00:48:33,244
You could be a big help to us.

584
00:48:33,246 --> 00:48:34,845
Inside?

585
00:48:35,848 --> 00:48:38,315
I'm not asking you
to wear a wire.

586
00:48:38,317 --> 00:48:41,117
I just want you to
keep your eyes open.

587
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:43,319
Falco will be our contact.

588
00:48:44,188 --> 00:48:47,222
Come on, what do you say?

589
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:50,892
I'm sorry.

590
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:55,230
But I can only work
for one client at a time.

591
00:48:57,467 --> 00:48:59,066
Okay.

592
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:02,369
I'm sorry, Falco.

593
00:49:02,371 --> 00:49:03,236
It's not your fault.

594
00:49:03,238 --> 00:49:07,506
Tell me something, are you involved
with this Farrow-Smith guy?

595
00:49:07,508 --> 00:49:08,740
Excuse me?

596
00:49:08,742 --> 00:49:10,374
Just asking.

597
00:49:13,645 --> 00:49:14,810
Three more seconds.

598
00:49:14,812 --> 00:49:17,712
That's all I needed,
was three more seconds.

599
00:49:17,714 --> 00:49:19,413
You can't let it get to you.

600
00:49:19,415 --> 00:49:22,182
He was dropping his gun.

601
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:24,817
Why didn't they wait?
I was talking him down.

602
00:49:24,819 --> 00:49:26,518
We weren't willing
to take that risk.

603
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:27,619
It doesn't take
three seconds to know

604
00:49:27,621 --> 00:49:29,554
you'd trade dead
criminals for dead cops.

605
00:49:29,556 --> 00:49:32,957
And these were our people. You hesitated.
You could be dead.

606
00:49:32,959 --> 00:49:36,093
I didn't hesitate.
I didn't shoot him.

607
00:49:36,095 --> 00:49:36,860
Why did you shoot him?

608
00:49:36,862 --> 00:49:40,296
Sometimes you just have
to expedite the scene.

609
00:49:40,298 --> 00:49:42,097
Aren't we supposed
to be the good guys?

610
00:49:42,099 --> 00:49:47,368
Listen, the report is going to read
that when Joey's gun jammed...

611
00:49:49,604 --> 00:49:52,237
...that's when we made
the call to drop him.

612
00:49:52,973 --> 00:49:54,872
You with me on this?

613
00:52:06,232 --> 00:52:08,265
Negative on blood on the floor.

614
00:52:08,267 --> 00:52:13,403
Well, I stabbed him pretty good
with this, in the shoulder.

615
00:52:13,538 --> 00:52:17,806
Anybody turns up in the ER with a
chunk of wood in his shoulder,

616
00:52:17,808 --> 00:52:20,575
we'll turn him on a spit.

617
00:52:24,213 --> 00:52:27,714
You're telling me
everything, right?

618
00:52:28,516 --> 00:52:29,715
Of course I am.

619
00:52:29,717 --> 00:52:31,183
I mean, you know,
'cause I'm thinking

620
00:52:31,185 --> 00:52:33,785
some guy you've gotten
the skinny on,

621
00:52:33,787 --> 00:52:35,186
somebody with a lot to lose,

622
00:52:35,188 --> 00:52:36,921
wants to take a look
at your records.

623
00:52:36,923 --> 00:52:39,356
They're kept at the office.
Anybody would know that.

624
00:52:39,358 --> 00:52:40,724
I don't know. Maybe somebody
just wants to make sure

625
00:52:40,726 --> 00:52:45,495
you're not holding on to
something for future reference.

626
00:52:48,266 --> 00:52:50,666
It would take me a week to even

627
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:53,235
figure out what was
missing from this.

628
00:52:53,237 --> 00:52:56,171
We'll take this to the lab,
check it for blood residue.

629
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:59,040
Looks like this tip
has been broken clean off.

630
00:52:59,042 --> 00:53:01,242
I'm still checking for prints.

631
00:53:03,145 --> 00:53:06,746
Check out the pig. Hey, piggy.

632
00:53:08,015 --> 00:53:09,080
You okay, Derian?

633
00:53:09,082 --> 00:53:12,450
Yeah, I'm just
pretty shaken up.

634
00:53:28,766 --> 00:53:30,165
Hey.

635
00:53:32,269 --> 00:53:36,738
Someone broke into my apartment
last night while I was there.

636
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:39,507
Are you all right?
Did you get hurt?

637
00:53:40,176 --> 00:53:41,909
I'm okay.

638
00:53:42,845 --> 00:53:45,412
The police came. It's over.

639
00:53:45,414 --> 00:53:47,080
Did they catch him?

640
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:50,015
No.

641
00:53:53,587 --> 00:53:55,853
Derian, come here.

642
00:54:01,293 --> 00:54:03,192
I'm sorry.

643
00:54:04,161 --> 00:54:08,563
I haven't been able
to stop thinking about you.

644
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:15,002
All I want to do is
be able to take care of you.

645
00:54:15,704 --> 00:54:17,336
Protect you.

646
00:54:19,139 --> 00:54:21,105
Somewhere there waits a wife.

647
00:54:21,107 --> 00:54:24,374
Somewhere, but not waiting.

648
00:54:25,176 --> 00:54:32,080
All I can think about is how much
I want to be with you right now.

649
00:54:36,352 --> 00:54:37,751
Yeah?

650
00:56:03,202 --> 00:56:06,403
I can hear all the
years just rushing by

651
00:56:06,405 --> 00:56:08,304
like some kind of
runaway train.

652
00:56:08,306 --> 00:56:12,608
All I have to show for it is
a house with no furniture,

653
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:15,110
and an empty marriage.

654
00:56:15,645 --> 00:56:17,344
Michael...

655
00:56:18,246 --> 00:56:21,213
Why don't you level with me?

656
00:56:23,951 --> 00:56:26,718
Why the sudden interest?

657
00:56:26,853 --> 00:56:30,087
Do you prefer
to keep it casual?

658
00:56:39,731 --> 00:56:41,797
There is nothing

659
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:44,865
casual about us.

660
00:56:47,569 --> 00:56:50,536
You're everything that I want.

661
00:56:56,176 --> 00:56:59,410
That's a dangerous statement.

662
00:57:01,914 --> 00:57:04,748
You're like an addiction.

663
00:57:06,251 --> 00:57:07,850
Yeah.

664
00:57:09,386 --> 00:57:11,619
And you're a married man.

665
00:57:16,792 --> 00:57:18,491
Yes, I am.

666
00:57:24,599 --> 00:57:26,999
I don't have to be.

667
00:57:27,134 --> 00:57:33,204
You know, I often think about how
pleasant life would be without Anthea.

668
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,539
Is that an idle thought?

669
00:57:35,541 --> 00:57:41,311
Well, she could take
a tumble down the stairs.

670
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:44,213
Excuse me?

671
00:57:44,315 --> 00:57:47,282
Jesus Christ, Derian,
I was joking.

672
00:57:49,219 --> 00:57:53,521
Besides, I think
she's seeing someone.

673
00:57:54,290 --> 00:57:58,058
She's been acting
very strange lately.

674
00:57:58,693 --> 00:58:01,527
Meetings she has that
she won't talk about.

675
00:58:01,529 --> 00:58:04,796
Places that she
has to go by herself.

676
00:58:04,798 --> 00:58:07,064
Just the other day,

677
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,833
I found this in her car.

678
00:58:09,835 --> 00:58:12,535
It's a man's ring.
She knows I found it.

679
00:58:12,537 --> 00:58:17,106
But of course, she can't
talk to me about it.

680
00:58:17,308 --> 00:58:19,641
I even thought of
hiring someone.

681
00:58:19,643 --> 00:58:21,476
Hiring someone?

682
00:58:21,678 --> 00:58:23,077
Yes.

683
00:58:24,146 --> 00:58:25,745
A detective.

684
00:58:30,585 --> 00:58:32,952
Do you want the job?

685
00:58:33,721 --> 00:58:35,353
What do you mean?

686
00:58:35,722 --> 00:58:40,024
It's not exactly insurance
investigation, but...

687
00:58:41,327 --> 00:58:42,959
Derian, what's the matter?

688
00:58:42,961 --> 00:58:45,428
Nothing. I just...

689
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:47,396
You just what?

690
00:58:48,165 --> 00:58:49,631
Oh.

691
00:58:49,633 --> 00:58:53,468
I guess you're throwing
a lot of information at me.

692
00:58:53,636 --> 00:58:55,469
You're right. I'm sorry.

693
00:58:56,405 --> 00:58:58,505
Anthea is my problem.

694
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,573
Do you love her?

695
00:59:03,678 --> 00:59:07,613
We've just been going through the
motions for a very long time now.

696
00:59:07,615 --> 00:59:11,516
But you care if she's
seeing someone else,

697
00:59:11,518 --> 00:59:12,683
even though you're
right here with me.

698
00:59:12,685 --> 00:59:16,753
No. I just want
to know where I stand.

699
00:59:42,547 --> 00:59:45,447
I thought it was
the husband we were on.

700
00:59:45,449 --> 00:59:47,449
Change of plan.

701
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:14,074
Buzzer doesn't work.

702
01:00:14,076 --> 01:00:14,974
I noticed.

703
01:00:14,976 --> 01:00:17,609
I'll have to come down.

704
01:00:20,347 --> 01:00:21,547
A women with her kind of money

705
01:00:21,548 --> 01:00:23,781
hanging out with
a loser like him.

706
01:00:23,783 --> 01:00:24,783
That doesn't make sense.

707
01:00:24,784 --> 01:00:28,452
Travis, your powers
of perception are uncanny.

708
01:00:28,454 --> 01:00:30,053
Uncanny.

709
01:00:30,055 --> 01:00:34,023
What? What did I say?

710
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:37,192
Finally.

711
01:00:43,533 --> 01:00:46,033
Do you meet many of
your clients here?

712
01:00:46,035 --> 01:00:49,369
Yeah. I wind up in a lot
of fun places with my job.

713
01:00:49,371 --> 01:00:51,137
Are those bullet holes?

714
01:00:51,139 --> 01:00:53,072
Yeah, .45s.

715
01:00:53,507 --> 01:00:54,539
Two guys got shot.

716
01:00:54,541 --> 01:00:55,439
Don't touch them.

717
01:00:55,441 --> 01:00:57,040
Then the car was stripped,

718
01:00:57,042 --> 01:00:58,808
the dead bodies
are still inside.

719
01:00:58,810 --> 01:00:59,742
God, that's horrible.

720
01:00:59,744 --> 01:01:03,278
I'm just doing the insurance
write-up for the car.

721
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:05,613
We document the damage
for the underwriter.

722
01:01:05,615 --> 01:01:07,047
What will they do with the car?

723
01:01:07,049 --> 01:01:10,183
Why? Are you interested
in buying it?

724
01:01:10,185 --> 01:01:12,718
After it's out of impound,
they'll fix it up,

725
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,086
and sell it to somebody
who will think

726
01:01:14,088 --> 01:01:17,622
they got a deal on
an almost-new BMW.

727
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:21,191
I just hope karma
doesn't cover cars.

728
01:01:23,261 --> 01:01:24,293
Bye, Joe.

729
01:01:24,295 --> 01:01:25,227
Okay, Derian.

730
01:01:25,229 --> 01:01:29,064
You said you had
something to show me.

731
01:01:43,847 --> 01:01:46,214
A little extra service bonus?

732
01:01:46,216 --> 01:01:49,250
Knowing what's going on
keeps me alive.

733
01:01:49,252 --> 01:01:50,417
Who is this guy?

734
01:01:50,419 --> 01:01:52,318
None of your business.

735
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:54,519
I didn't ask you to follow me.

736
01:01:54,521 --> 01:01:57,588
No. You just gave me
four different stories

737
01:01:57,590 --> 01:01:59,823
of why I should
follow your husband.

738
01:01:59,825 --> 01:02:01,024
You're worried he's cheating,

739
01:02:01,026 --> 01:02:02,191
you're worried he's violent,

740
01:02:02,193 --> 01:02:03,192
you want me to sleep with him,

741
01:02:03,194 --> 01:02:04,927
you're scared of
his business partners.

742
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:07,629
And just as one story
turns out to be bullshit,

743
01:02:07,631 --> 01:02:10,064
a sliver of it twists and
spins into the next story

744
01:02:10,066 --> 01:02:15,869
blurring the lines of what's
really true and what isn't.

745
01:02:15,871 --> 01:02:18,872
What are you hiding, Anthea?

746
01:02:18,874 --> 01:02:20,340
Hmm?

747
01:02:22,177 --> 01:02:22,842
Who is this guy?

748
01:02:22,844 --> 01:02:25,611
How do you know he's not my
down-on-his-luck brother?

749
01:02:25,613 --> 01:02:29,615
Well, for one thing,
you're an only child.

750
01:02:31,318 --> 01:02:33,918
It's so nice to know
I hired a pro.

751
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:38,522
You know what I think? I think
you wanted out of your marriage,

752
01:02:38,524 --> 01:02:42,259
but on your terms,
with leverage.

753
01:02:42,661 --> 01:02:44,260
I was the lever.

754
01:02:50,401 --> 01:02:53,969
I'm officially
off the job, Anthea.

755
01:02:54,304 --> 01:02:56,070
Goodbye.

756
01:03:00,209 --> 01:03:05,312
It wasn't too hard for you
to blur that line, was it?

757
01:03:05,747 --> 01:03:07,446
Did watching him for me make it

758
01:03:07,448 --> 01:03:11,116
that much more
interesting for you?

759
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,819
I don't know.

760
01:03:53,191 --> 01:03:54,423
You put me undercover as bait,

761
01:03:54,425 --> 01:03:56,525
hoping Carl would bite hook
and I'd get him that way.

762
01:03:56,527 --> 01:03:57,659
Then you didn't let me
do my fucking job!

763
01:03:57,661 --> 01:04:01,929
Your fucking job is to walk
out of a situation alive.

764
01:04:01,931 --> 01:04:02,996
You did. That's right, I did.

765
01:04:02,998 --> 01:04:06,466
And you had somebody killed
that you didn't have to.

766
01:04:06,468 --> 01:04:08,067
The call was made.
We stand by it.

767
01:04:08,069 --> 01:04:11,503
That's great.
'Cause you know what?

768
01:04:12,072 --> 01:04:12,970
I'm done.

769
01:04:12,972 --> 01:04:15,439
It'll be here
when you come back.

770
01:04:31,857 --> 01:04:34,290
<i>- Mr. Farrow-Smith?</i>
- Yes, Janice.

771
01:04:34,292 --> 01:04:35,424
<i>Line 2, Derian McCall.</i>

772
01:04:35,426 --> 01:04:38,393
Can you have her hold, please?
I'll be right on.

773
01:04:38,395 --> 01:04:39,660
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

774
01:04:39,662 --> 01:04:41,428
Thank you.

775
01:04:50,005 --> 01:04:51,537
Derian.

776
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:53,237
<i>Hi, Michael.</i>

777
01:04:53,239 --> 01:04:55,372
I was just thinking about you.

778
01:04:55,374 --> 01:04:57,574
I'm standing at
my office window,

779
01:04:57,576 --> 01:05:00,710
imagining you
down there somewhere.

780
01:05:00,712 --> 01:05:02,545
Michael, it has to end.

781
01:05:02,547 --> 01:05:03,846
<i>What's the matter?</i>

782
01:05:03,848 --> 01:05:04,913
Everything.

783
01:05:04,915 --> 01:05:06,514
Derian,

784
01:05:06,682 --> 01:05:09,115
we have done nothing wrong.

785
01:05:09,117 --> 01:05:10,616
All you have done is
forced me to face the fact

786
01:05:10,618 --> 01:05:15,320
that my marriage has been
over for a very long time.

787
01:05:15,322 --> 01:05:17,622
Michael, please, it has to end.

788
01:05:17,624 --> 01:05:19,724
<i>Christ, Derian,</i>
<i>you can't do this.</i>

789
01:05:19,726 --> 01:05:21,459
Not like this.
Not on the phone.

790
01:05:21,461 --> 01:05:23,794
That's the only way
I can do it.

791
01:05:23,796 --> 01:05:26,196
<i>I'm sorry. You know,</i>

792
01:05:26,198 --> 01:05:29,332
it really is something up here.

793
01:05:31,736 --> 01:05:33,969
All this randomness

794
01:05:33,971 --> 01:05:36,071
somehow has some
kind of special order,

795
01:05:36,073 --> 01:05:39,307
if you just see it
from the right distance.

796
01:05:39,309 --> 01:05:40,875
<i>Derian, that's what</i>
<i>you have to do.</i>

797
01:05:40,877 --> 01:05:43,744
<i>You have to see this</i>
<i>from the right distance.</i>

798
01:05:43,746 --> 01:05:48,415
I just need some time. Then you
and I, we can be together.

799
01:05:53,822 --> 01:05:55,521
Michael...

800
01:05:57,858 --> 01:06:00,058
I have to hang up now.

801
01:06:00,193 --> 01:06:01,025
Okay, Derian.

802
01:06:01,027 --> 01:06:05,929
You do what you have
to do, and so will I.

803
01:06:55,345 --> 01:06:55,843
Hello?

804
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:58,512
<i>Derian, it's Travis.</i>
<i>Can you get over here?</i>

805
01:06:58,514 --> 01:07:00,180
What is it?

806
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:01,981
There's something I want
you to take a look at.

807
01:07:01,983 --> 01:07:04,216
It's our boy from
the low-rent district.

808
01:07:04,218 --> 01:07:05,218
I'm off that job, Travis.

809
01:07:05,219 --> 01:07:08,954
<i>Yeah. But I think you're
going to want to see this.</i>

810
01:07:08,956 --> 01:07:10,288
Why?

811
01:07:10,290 --> 01:07:12,089
Would you just get over here?

812
01:07:13,959 --> 01:07:15,425
Okay.

813
01:07:15,827 --> 01:07:16,358
<i>All right.</i>

814
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:19,794
<i>I'm going to run out. If you get here
first, you know where the keys are.</i>

815
01:07:19,796 --> 01:07:23,697
Don't go drinking
my last beer, all right?

816
01:08:24,524 --> 01:08:26,123
Travis!

817
01:09:53,210 --> 01:09:53,942
Travis, I was...

818
01:09:53,944 --> 01:09:56,945
<i>Derian, you have to help me.</i>

819
01:09:56,947 --> 01:09:58,579
Who is this? <i> It's Anthea.</i>

820
01:09:58,581 --> 01:10:00,881
<i>Michael's going to kill me.</i>

821
01:10:00,883 --> 01:10:02,282
What are you talking about?

822
01:10:02,284 --> 01:10:03,249
<i>I called him on everything.</i>

823
01:10:03,251 --> 01:10:07,820
<i>The people he's been doing business
with, fucking with my trust fund,</i>

824
01:10:07,822 --> 01:10:08,954
<i>you, everything.</i>

825
01:10:08,956 --> 01:10:13,325
<i>He hit me, Derian. He
pushed me down the stairs.</i>

826
01:10:13,327 --> 01:10:14,292
What?

827
01:10:14,294 --> 01:10:16,160
<i>He just kept hitting me.</i>

828
01:10:16,162 --> 01:10:19,730
<i>I'm bleeding. I'm so scared.</i>

829
01:10:24,036 --> 01:10:24,768
Where is he now?

830
01:10:24,770 --> 01:10:26,703
<i>He's upstairs, I think.</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

831
01:10:26,705 --> 01:10:29,539
<i>God, he's out of his mind.</i>
<i>It's totally dark here.</i>

832
01:10:29,541 --> 01:10:31,207
<i>He pulled the circuit</i>
<i>breakers, I think.</i>

833
01:10:31,209 --> 01:10:36,378
Do you hear me? When I hang up here,
I want you to call the police.

834
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:38,546
<i>Oh, God, help me.</i>

835
01:10:39,982 --> 01:10:41,481
I'm coming over.

836
01:10:41,483 --> 01:10:44,484
Call the police, Anthea. Okay?

837
01:10:44,486 --> 01:10:46,419
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

838
01:11:15,583 --> 01:11:17,115
Anthea?

839
01:11:24,090 --> 01:11:25,756
Anthea?

840
01:11:31,797 --> 01:11:33,530
Anthea?

841
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:53,216
He went crazy.

842
01:11:53,751 --> 01:11:55,584
Did you shoot him?

843
01:11:55,586 --> 01:11:59,087
It went off.
It hit the ceiling.

844
01:11:59,089 --> 01:12:02,490
All right. Give me the gun.

845
01:12:05,027 --> 01:12:07,293
Give me the gun.

846
01:12:17,772 --> 01:12:18,570
Where is he?

847
01:12:18,572 --> 01:12:22,040
I don't know.
I think he's upstairs.

848
01:12:26,379 --> 01:12:28,412
Did you call the police?

849
01:12:28,414 --> 01:12:30,480
I want you to go outside, okay?

850
01:12:30,482 --> 01:12:33,015
Go outside and wait
for the police to get here.

851
01:12:33,017 --> 01:12:35,283
Will you be okay? Yeah.

852
01:12:35,285 --> 01:12:38,452
I'm going to see
if he's still here.

853
01:12:49,498 --> 01:12:51,164
Michael?

854
01:13:15,758 --> 01:13:17,390
Michael?

855
01:13:59,766 --> 01:14:00,798
Move, move!

856
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:01,732
Yes, sir.

857
01:14:01,734 --> 01:14:02,866
If anybody is in the house,

858
01:14:02,868 --> 01:14:05,635
I want you to identify
yourself now.

859
01:14:05,637 --> 01:14:09,739
Anybody in the house,
come out with your hands up.

860
01:14:10,141 --> 01:14:14,877
Let me see your hands! Put
the gun down, nice and slow.

861
01:14:14,879 --> 01:14:17,846
Put your hands in the air.
Turn around!

862
01:14:17,848 --> 01:14:20,782
Put your hands on your head.

863
01:14:22,085 --> 01:14:25,152
Do you have any weapons on you?

864
01:14:25,154 --> 01:14:27,053
Waistband.

865
01:14:37,331 --> 01:14:39,798
Okay, check it out.

866
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,780
Come on, Ms. McCall.

867
01:15:02,755 --> 01:15:04,154
Derian, it doesn't look good.

868
01:15:04,156 --> 01:15:07,023
They have an eyewitness
in Mrs. Farrow-Smith,

869
01:15:07,025 --> 01:15:09,458
a small mountain
of circumstantial evidence.

870
01:15:09,460 --> 01:15:12,093
Your fingerprints are all
over the murder weapon.

871
01:15:12,095 --> 01:15:15,329
It looks like you were involved
with a romantic triangle,

872
01:15:15,331 --> 01:15:18,732
and Michael Farrow-Smith
was killed over it.

873
01:15:19,968 --> 01:15:21,133
That may be our best tact.

874
01:15:21,135 --> 01:15:24,836
Heat of passion, lean
toward temporary insanity.

875
01:15:24,838 --> 01:15:27,104
It's workable
if we get the right jury.

876
01:15:27,106 --> 01:15:29,039
Only it never
happened that way.

877
01:15:29,041 --> 01:15:32,842
She set me up
so she could kill him.

878
01:15:33,010 --> 01:15:33,775
That's what happened.

879
01:15:33,777 --> 01:15:36,944
For the almost-nothing-it's-worth,
I believe you.

880
01:15:36,946 --> 01:15:40,247
But you've been seen stalking
this guy for some time.

881
01:15:40,249 --> 01:15:42,649
It was my job to follow him.

882
01:15:42,651 --> 01:15:45,018
She hired me to follow him.

883
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:45,718
Let me play D.A. here.

884
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:49,588
I'm thinking that maybe you got
caught up with your target.

885
01:15:49,590 --> 01:15:52,390
Got involved with him,
obsessed on him.

886
01:15:52,392 --> 01:15:54,158
It happens.

887
01:16:05,202 --> 01:16:06,601
A picture.

888
01:16:08,938 --> 01:16:10,671
Travis...

889
01:16:11,206 --> 01:16:14,140
Travis wanted me
to see that picture.

890
01:16:15,076 --> 01:16:18,210
Why did he want me...
Ask Travis.

891
01:16:18,212 --> 01:16:20,278
Travis? Travis Monroe?

892
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:20,945
Yeah. He had a picture.

893
01:16:20,947 --> 01:16:24,014
Jesus, Derian,
I thought you knew.

894
01:16:24,082 --> 01:16:25,247
Knew what?

895
01:16:25,249 --> 01:16:28,049
Travis was killed
the other night.

896
01:16:28,351 --> 01:16:29,983
What? Yeah.

897
01:16:29,985 --> 01:16:31,250
Looks like some
random nut thing.

898
01:16:31,252 --> 01:16:36,154
We found his body stuffed in a
dumpster behind his building.

899
01:16:44,364 --> 01:16:45,763
Jeff,

900
01:16:46,599 --> 01:16:49,166
I want you to go
to my apartment.

901
01:16:49,168 --> 01:16:53,904
On the table, when you
first walk in the door,

902
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:55,671
there's a picture.

903
01:16:55,673 --> 01:16:58,140
I want you to bring it to me.

904
01:16:58,142 --> 01:16:59,040
I want you to go to my office,

905
01:16:59,042 --> 01:17:04,712
get every single thing in the
Farrow-Smith file. All right?

906
01:17:04,847 --> 01:17:08,014
Bring me everything
that's in it.

907
01:17:08,149 --> 01:17:10,482
That was not a random thing.

908
01:17:10,484 --> 01:17:13,718
That was not a random thing.

909
01:18:02,301 --> 01:18:03,667
He's not dead, Falco.

910
01:18:03,669 --> 01:18:04,734
Who's not dead?

911
01:18:04,736 --> 01:18:05,501
Michael Farrow-Smith.

912
01:18:05,503 --> 01:18:07,769
They were both setting me
up from the beginning.

913
01:18:07,771 --> 01:18:08,603
They're in this together.

914
01:18:08,605 --> 01:18:10,304
Hey, wait a minute. You're
going to have to start

915
01:18:10,306 --> 01:18:11,705
a little slower, okay?

916
01:18:11,707 --> 01:18:12,338
Listen to me.

917
01:18:12,340 --> 01:18:14,540
Michael's about to go down hard
on money laundering, right?

918
01:18:14,542 --> 01:18:18,610
The Feds are this close to getting him.
If they don't, the mob will.

919
01:18:18,612 --> 01:18:20,511
He needs the ultimate out.

920
01:18:20,513 --> 01:18:22,613
So you're telling me
he faked his own death?

921
01:18:22,615 --> 01:18:24,314
Doesn't it solve
a lot of his problems?

922
01:18:24,316 --> 01:18:27,583
He's got a tailor-made
suspect. He's got me.

923
01:18:27,585 --> 01:18:28,917
Okay, so what about the stiff?

924
01:18:28,919 --> 01:18:32,954
You know, the one with the Michael
Farrow-Smith toe tag on it.

925
01:18:32,956 --> 01:18:35,056
I think it's this guy.

926
01:18:35,058 --> 01:18:37,758
We trailed Anthea to his place.

927
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:38,525
Look at his shoulder.

928
01:18:38,527 --> 01:18:41,928
Unless I'm wrong, this is the same
guy that broke into my place.

929
01:18:41,930 --> 01:18:43,296
He was trying to make
sure that I didn't have

930
01:18:43,298 --> 01:18:46,098
any evidence that
would unravel their plan.

931
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:47,132
So who is he?

932
01:18:47,134 --> 01:18:47,966
I don't know.

933
01:18:47,968 --> 01:18:52,070
Some guy they hired to do
whatever they needed done

934
01:18:52,072 --> 01:18:55,106
until they didn't
need him anymore.

935
01:18:55,108 --> 01:18:59,343
So they blew off his face
to make him pass for Michael?

936
01:18:59,845 --> 01:19:01,811
I think it's possible.

937
01:19:02,413 --> 01:19:07,416
It was not Michael's watch
on the body I saw.

938
01:19:09,319 --> 01:19:11,118
Did you run prints on the body?

939
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:14,087
His hands were blown off,
defensive gesture.

940
01:19:14,089 --> 01:19:16,055
Falco, I know I stuck that guy

941
01:19:16,057 --> 01:19:19,291
who broke into my place
with that Indonesian statue.

942
01:19:19,293 --> 01:19:20,592
If this is the same guy,

943
01:19:20,594 --> 01:19:24,329
he would have a puncture
wound in his left shoulder.

944
01:19:24,331 --> 01:19:26,230
Would you look?
Would you check to see?

945
01:19:26,232 --> 01:19:30,367
There might still be mahogany
traces in the shoulder.

946
01:19:30,802 --> 01:19:33,369
Okay, I'll tell you what,
I'll take this picture.

947
01:19:33,371 --> 01:19:34,203
I'll run a forensic comparison

948
01:19:34,205 --> 01:19:37,439
on this guy and the guy
in the morgue. Okay?

949
01:19:37,441 --> 01:19:41,876
I'll even comb through the evidence room.
I'll do what I can.

950
01:19:44,513 --> 01:19:45,945
Guard!

951
01:20:16,777 --> 01:20:21,212
Well, Derian, I guess
this is your lucky day.

952
01:20:29,855 --> 01:20:30,720
Okay, there you go.

953
01:20:30,722 --> 01:20:31,787
Thank you. Thank you.

954
01:20:31,789 --> 01:20:32,788
Hi. Do you have your ticket?

955
01:20:32,790 --> 01:20:34,055
It's electronic. Alice Jones.

956
01:20:34,057 --> 01:20:36,624
Okay, I'll just need
to see an ID.

957
01:20:40,596 --> 01:20:41,861
Thanks.

958
01:20:41,863 --> 01:20:47,066
Police business. Out of the way, please.
Step aside, please.

959
01:20:49,003 --> 01:20:49,968
Mrs. Anthea Farrow-Smith?

960
01:20:49,970 --> 01:20:53,037
Metropolitan Police, ma'am.
Can you step this way, please?

961
01:20:53,039 --> 01:20:53,604
What's this about?

962
01:20:53,606 --> 01:20:56,373
Material witness to a homicide.

963
01:21:11,156 --> 01:21:13,222
Did this man book a flight?

964
01:21:15,726 --> 01:21:16,524
No, sir, I'm sorry.

965
01:21:16,526 --> 01:21:19,927
But there is a Herbert Jones
pre-checked with Mrs. Jones.

966
01:21:19,929 --> 01:21:23,363
<i>He should be</i>
<i>on the plane already.</i>

967
01:21:31,673 --> 01:21:33,072
Where's the guy
in the seat next to you?

968
01:21:33,074 --> 01:21:36,708
I don't know.
No one else has boarded.

969
01:21:36,843 --> 01:21:38,375
Damn.

970
01:22:16,148 --> 01:22:17,148
Derian.

971
01:22:17,149 --> 01:22:18,515
You look down,

972
01:22:18,517 --> 01:22:22,752
see how you can use life
to your advantage.

973
01:22:24,655 --> 01:22:28,456
I know you have no
reason to believe me,

974
01:22:29,325 --> 01:22:33,226
but everything that
happened between us,

975
01:22:33,294 --> 01:22:33,925
that was real.

976
01:22:33,927 --> 01:22:36,994
It was so real you wind up
here, making your escape,

977
01:22:36,996 --> 01:22:39,863
and I wind up with a murder
rap, looking at life in prison.

978
01:22:39,865 --> 01:22:41,698
Once everything
was set in motion,

979
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:44,701
Jesus Christ,
I couldn't get out.

980
01:22:44,703 --> 01:22:46,369
And I believed
everything you told me.

981
01:22:46,371 --> 01:22:51,574
Derian, you were part of our plan
at the beginning, that's true.

982
01:22:51,576 --> 01:22:54,410
But it was a simple plan.

983
01:22:54,545 --> 01:22:57,879
It was never supposed to
go on this long.

984
01:22:57,881 --> 01:23:00,348
Nobody was
supposed to get hurt.

985
01:23:01,351 --> 01:23:05,119
What about that guy on the bed?

986
01:23:05,421 --> 01:23:06,953
He was dead.

987
01:23:06,955 --> 01:23:08,888
And what about Travis?

988
01:23:08,890 --> 01:23:10,723
That was not my idea.

989
01:23:10,725 --> 01:23:14,526
Just wound up that way?

990
01:23:17,230 --> 01:23:20,331
Anthea hated watching me
fall in love with you.

991
01:23:20,333 --> 01:23:23,233
But she wanted it
at the same time.

992
01:23:23,235 --> 01:23:26,836
She knew the only way she could
have you was through me.

993
01:23:26,838 --> 01:23:29,171
We let it go on too long.

994
01:23:29,173 --> 01:23:31,072
The people we owed money to,

995
01:23:31,074 --> 01:23:34,075
they started to figure out
what was going on.

996
01:23:34,077 --> 01:23:35,776
Anthea got desperate.
She panicked.

997
01:23:35,778 --> 01:23:40,046
But you didn't panic,
did you, Michael?

998
01:23:40,415 --> 01:23:42,281
The cops picked up
Anthea at the airport.

999
01:23:42,283 --> 01:23:44,517
How come you weren't with her?

1000
01:23:44,952 --> 01:23:46,718
I told you.

1001
01:23:48,354 --> 01:23:51,221
I wanted out of my marriage.

1002
01:23:51,856 --> 01:23:54,289
I want to be with you.

1003
01:23:55,125 --> 01:23:58,426
I don't believe
you were part of this.

1004
01:23:58,428 --> 01:24:00,261
I have $20,000
in this envelope,

1005
01:24:00,263 --> 01:24:04,832
and a numbered bank
account with $37 million.

1006
01:24:05,434 --> 01:24:08,201
We could be anyone we want.

1007
01:24:08,203 --> 01:24:09,168
We could start
a new life tomorrow.

1008
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:13,472
If you mean that, then
turn yourself in, Michael.

1009
01:24:13,474 --> 01:24:17,375
Don't threaten me,
Derian. Don't.

1010
01:24:18,311 --> 01:24:20,811
If you don't, Michael,

1011
01:24:23,215 --> 01:24:24,647
I will.

1012
01:24:24,649 --> 01:24:27,282
I'm not going to jail.

1013
01:24:27,417 --> 01:24:29,116
I'm not going to spend
the rest of my life

1014
01:24:29,118 --> 01:24:32,419
in some fucking black hole.

1015
01:24:43,698 --> 01:24:45,364
Well, Derian,

1016
01:24:45,366 --> 01:24:47,566
it's like I said.

1017
01:24:47,768 --> 01:24:51,302
You have to do
what you have to do.

1018
01:24:51,771 --> 01:24:52,803
And so do I.

1019
01:24:52,805 --> 01:24:56,306
What are you going to do,
Derian, shoot me?

1020
01:24:56,308 --> 01:25:00,643
Come on, Derian.
Shoot me in the back.

1021
01:25:01,112 --> 01:25:02,978
Don't do this, Michael.

1022
01:25:02,980 --> 01:25:06,381
Come on. Shoot me in the back.

1023
01:25:07,317 --> 01:25:08,916
Come on, Derian.

1024
01:25:10,019 --> 01:25:11,618
Come on!

1025
01:25:11,786 --> 01:25:13,185
Come on!

1026
01:25:55,562 --> 01:25:59,196
God, Michael.

1027
01:26:31,862 --> 01:26:35,296
<i>9-1-1. What's your emergency?</i>

1028
01:26:46,776 --> 01:26:51,512
<i>Ma'am? What is the nature</i>
<i>of your emergency?</i>

1029
01:26:52,281 --> 01:26:53,847
<i>Hello?</i>

1030
01:26:57,385 --> 01:26:58,951
<i>Ma'am?</i>

1031
01:27:34,287 --> 01:27:39,189
<i>Your job is to walk</i>
<i>out of a situation alive.</i>

1032
01:27:41,826 --> 01:27:43,458
<i>You did.</i>
