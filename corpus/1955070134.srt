1
00:03:06,938 --> 00:03:07,981
What do you want, Rocco?

2
00:03:08,565 --> 00:03:09,732
What we all want.

3
00:03:10,275 --> 00:03:13,444
To not die young, poor or alone.

4
00:03:13,528 --> 00:03:14,529
Manny...

5
00:03:14,779 --> 00:03:17,407
These guys, they...

6
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,076
I don't give them what they're after,

7
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,078
they'll kill me.

8
00:03:23,371 --> 00:03:24,372
Hold it, Rocco.

9
00:03:24,831 --> 00:03:27,083
We don't fight these guys.

10
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,918
Sure, maybe you get that...

11
00:03:29,794 --> 00:03:31,212
- Shit. God damn it.
- Cut!

12
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:33,631
- Props!
- Cut.

13
00:03:33,715 --> 00:03:34,757
Sorry, everyone.

14
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:36,426
- We're going again, Eddie.
- I don't know what happened.

15
00:03:36,509 --> 00:03:37,510
Sorry, Sam.

16
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:40,471
Of course, the one day
the author is among us.

17
00:03:40,722 --> 00:03:42,724
Among us. Sure as hell ain't one of us.

18
00:03:43,892 --> 00:03:46,394
What's my brilliant line, Trumbo?

19
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:48,479
Oh! I've got it right here.

20
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:52,233
"Hold it, Rocco. Now if...
If we don't fight these guys,

21
00:03:52,317 --> 00:03:56,195
"sure, maybe you get that
long, happy life we all want."

22
00:03:57,864 --> 00:03:59,365
So, what do you got me fighting for then?

23
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:03,745
Well, peace on Earth.
Good will toward men.

24
00:04:03,828 --> 00:04:05,330
Well, you can't do that. This is America.

25
00:04:06,873 --> 00:04:09,876
All right. How about sex and money?

26
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:12,670
There you go. Two things we all love.

27
00:04:12,754 --> 00:04:13,796
Well...

28
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,965
One of your little sermons on citizenship.

29
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,343
All right, going again.

30
00:04:20,011 --> 00:04:21,596
Mayer lined up the A Team.

31
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:24,515
Sam Wood to shoot,
Dalton Trumbo for rewrites.

32
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:25,767
I had no crew, I couldn't work.

33
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:26,893
So, good, fingers crossed

34
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:27,977
You wouldn't work.

35
00:04:28,061 --> 00:04:31,230
God forbid you cross a picket
line for set builders.

36
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:34,192
What the hell do set builders
have to do with writing?

37
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:38,446
What writers write, builders build.

38
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:40,740
What they build, you shoot.

39
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:42,867
Now, you make all the money
you possibly can.

40
00:04:42,951 --> 00:04:45,954
So do I. Why shouldn't they?
And why can't we help them?

41
00:04:46,037 --> 00:04:48,331
Listen to you, the swimming pool Soviet.

42
00:04:48,414 --> 00:04:50,208
Oh, for God's sakes, you won!

43
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,418
Sam, the strike is over.

44
00:04:52,502 --> 00:04:54,629
And you just might try
being a gracious winner!

45
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:56,506
You know, it's never over with you people!

46
00:04:56,714 --> 00:04:57,966
Strike after strike after strike!

47
00:04:58,049 --> 00:04:59,342
"You people"?

48
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:00,468
Whatever it takes to seek justice!

49
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:01,594
Hey, you know what?

50
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:02,720
- We've all...
- Laugh it up.

51
00:05:02,804 --> 00:05:05,598
- Why don't we all take six months off?
- Oh, come on, Sam!

52
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,725
- I'm gonna go on strike...
- Good for you.

53
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:09,811
...against people who go on strike.

54
00:05:09,894 --> 00:05:10,895
Sam, Sam...

55
00:05:11,062 --> 00:05:12,397
And I won't cross your picket line either.

56
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,731
Oh, give me that, Trumbo! You're just...

57
00:05:13,815 --> 00:05:15,942
- Sam! Sam!
- You know what? You know what?

58
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:17,777
I've spent a hell of a long time... What?

59
00:05:17,902 --> 00:05:18,861
You're not helping... Eddie...

60
00:05:18,945 --> 00:05:21,155
Sam, Sam. We gotta talk about
those scenes tomorrow.

61
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:23,574
Disaster. Who the hell wrote that crap?

62
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:25,410
But, uh, first...

63
00:05:25,493 --> 00:05:27,078
- Whoa, whoa!
- May I have this dance?

64
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:28,871
Eddie... You're spilling my drink.

65
00:05:28,955 --> 00:05:30,164
Having fun?

66
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,085
Eternally.

67
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:36,087
Miss Hopper.

68
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:40,174
Dateline, Hollywood.

69
00:05:40,258 --> 00:05:43,553
The offices of top columnist Hedda Hopper.

70
00:05:43,636 --> 00:05:48,266
Greetings from our film capital,
where all is sun and fun.

71
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,602
Or is it? You see the famous faces here?

72
00:05:52,145 --> 00:05:55,982
Danny Kaye, Humphrey Bogart,
his dishy bride Lauren Bacall.

73
00:05:56,107 --> 00:06:01,070
All of whom have declared solidarity
with film crews picketing for higher wages

74
00:06:01,154 --> 00:06:03,489
in walkouts that quickly turned violent.

75
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:09,120
Because these strikes were, in fact,
the work of dangerous radicals.

76
00:06:09,454 --> 00:06:13,791
Here, we see actor Edward G. Robinson,
star of Double Indemnity.

77
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:17,253
And this is writer Dalton Trumbo,

78
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:20,798
who is, like many of those
strikers and their supporters,

79
00:06:20,882 --> 00:06:23,051
a registered communist.

80
00:06:23,134 --> 00:06:25,553
Who exactly is behind these walkouts?

81
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:27,346
You actually create something...

82
00:06:27,472 --> 00:06:29,557
- And why?
- ...and they reap all the profits.

83
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,683
Now, is that fair?

84
00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:31,768
- No!
- No!

85
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:33,478
Our elected leaders will find out.

86
00:06:34,687 --> 00:06:39,609
Congressman J. Parnell Thomas and his
House Un-American Activities Committee.

87
00:06:39,692 --> 00:06:43,529
Communism is not some faraway threat.

88
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:45,490
Its most dangerous agents are here,

89
00:06:45,573 --> 00:06:48,034
controlling the airwaves
and movie screens.

90
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:49,994
Taking over its employees
and their unions.

91
00:06:50,495 --> 00:06:54,957
They need to be identified
as the enemies they are.

92
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:58,586
Communists, their goal: world domination.

93
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:01,172
The frontline of a new kind of war.

94
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:02,507
A cold war.

95
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,009
A conspiracy to corrupt democratic values

96
00:07:05,093 --> 00:07:07,762
and bring about
the overthrow of this nation.

97
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:12,433
Mitzi fell asleep.

98
00:07:12,517 --> 00:07:15,812
Hey! That you in the news reel?

99
00:07:15,895 --> 00:07:17,063
Yes, it was.

100
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:21,109
Traitor.

101
00:07:22,735 --> 00:07:24,403
Oh, my God! Honey.

102
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:26,030
No, I'm all right,
I'm all right. No harm done.

103
00:07:26,114 --> 00:07:27,240
Are you sure? Oh.

104
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:29,700
Come on. Let's go.

105
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,205
- Dad?
- Mmm.

106
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,583
Are you a communist?

107
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:38,918
I am.

108
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:43,422
Is that against the law?

109
00:07:43,548 --> 00:07:44,966
It is not.

110
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:52,473
The lady with the big hat said
you were a dangerous radical.

111
00:07:53,558 --> 00:07:54,559
Are you?

112
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:58,437
Radical? Maybe.

113
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:03,985
Dangerous. Only to men who fling Cokes.

114
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:06,529
I love our country.

115
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:08,990
And it's a good government.

116
00:08:09,073 --> 00:08:12,952
But anything good could be better,
don't you think?

117
00:08:15,246 --> 00:08:16,914
Is Mom a communist?

118
00:08:17,832 --> 00:08:18,916
No.

119
00:08:20,585 --> 00:08:21,752
Am I?

120
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:27,383
Well, why don't we give you
the official test?

121
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:29,093
Mom makes your favorite lunch.

122
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:30,595
Ham and cheese.

123
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,096
Ham and cheese.

124
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:35,850
And at school, you see someone
with no lunch at all.

125
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:36,934
What do you do?

126
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:38,853
Share.

127
00:08:38,978 --> 00:08:40,062
Share?

128
00:08:40,146 --> 00:08:42,565
Well, you don't tell them
to just go get a job?

129
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:43,774
No.

130
00:08:44,609 --> 00:08:47,445
Oh. You offer them a loan at 6%.
Oh, that's very clever.

131
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,613
Dad.

132
00:08:49,113 --> 00:08:51,824
Ah, then you just ignore them.

133
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:52,950
No.

134
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:56,204
Well, well.

135
00:08:56,287 --> 00:08:57,747
You little commie.

136
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:02,877
Trumbo, as usual,
you only make sense to you.

137
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,172
Now, let them call you
a communist, me a Democrat.

138
00:09:06,297 --> 00:09:07,757
They're both legitimate parties.

139
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,552
Yours is just meaner and duller, but
there's nothing illegal about any of it.

140
00:09:11,636 --> 00:09:12,970
- Yet...
- Hunter.

141
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:16,390
Tell your friend to dial down
the paranoia and have a drink.

142
00:09:16,474 --> 00:09:18,434
I don't think he's being paranoid enough.

143
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:20,478
Not you too.

144
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:21,896
You're out of ice.

145
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:26,192
Now, I have taken the liberty
of drawing up a pamphlet.

146
00:09:26,317 --> 00:09:30,279
The subject: Congress unaware
of a little thing

147
00:09:30,363 --> 00:09:32,198
called the First Amendment.

148
00:09:32,323 --> 00:09:35,326
They're aware of it.
They just don't give a shit.

149
00:09:35,451 --> 00:09:37,828
All they care about is this
nice new war of theirs.

150
00:09:38,454 --> 00:09:40,373
These guys love war
and this is a great one,

151
00:09:40,498 --> 00:09:43,876
'cause it's vague and it's scary
and it's expensive.

152
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:47,546
Anybody for it is a hero
and anybody against it is a traitor.

153
00:09:47,672 --> 00:09:48,756
Exactly, thank you.

154
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,383
Arlen, not near the paintings.

155
00:09:50,508 --> 00:09:54,637
And if you think this is about
the movies, you're an idiot.

156
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,266
Which is why I'm going to have
a little chat with the other side.

157
00:09:58,349 --> 00:10:00,017
You don't mean the Alliance, do you?

158
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:01,102
I do.

159
00:10:01,185 --> 00:10:02,853
Are you out of your mind?

160
00:10:02,979 --> 00:10:06,482
Eddie, they're all actors
and writers and directors, just like us.

161
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:09,527
They're Nazis. They're just too cheap
to buy the uniforms.

162
00:10:09,652 --> 00:10:11,070
They invited Congress out here.

163
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:14,490
And are they all Sam Woods
and Hedda Hoppers?

164
00:10:15,366 --> 00:10:18,953
Please, let's not demonize
people we don't really know.

165
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:20,037
I say we go for it.

166
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:22,957
And you know who you're gonna
be talking to there, don't you?

167
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,876
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. John Wayne.

168
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:36,137
I wanna say one thing
about a place I love.

169
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,264
No, not Hollywood.

170
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:43,060
I like Hollywood, but I love America.

171
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:50,067
And when we talk about America,
I'm talking about freedom.

172
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:53,821
The kind of freedom we just
fought a world war to save.

173
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:58,242
You want to be a communist?
Go be a communist.

174
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:03,122
But some friends of mine in Washington
think you got some questions to answer.

175
00:11:03,247 --> 00:11:04,790
I never knew he was this good.

176
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:06,417
You still want to be a commie...

177
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:08,669
- 'Cause he's not acting. That's him.
- ...go be one in Russia.

178
00:11:08,753 --> 00:11:12,631
But off you go and enjoy
the Bolshoi Ballet.

179
00:11:16,594 --> 00:11:19,180
Excuse me, sir, would you like to
read about the First Amendment?

180
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:21,140
- Sir, a little education.
- You know your rights?

181
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:22,892
Pamphlet on the First Amendment.

182
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:25,269
- A little light reading.
- Travels well.

183
00:11:27,146 --> 00:11:28,147
Well, thank you, Sam.

184
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,193
Do svidanya.

185
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:33,277
It costs money to print those.

186
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:35,488
How'd you like to learn
about the First Amendment?

187
00:11:35,613 --> 00:11:36,572
This is a nightmare.

188
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:37,740
Dalton.

189
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:40,910
Oh, Hedda. Good evening to you.

190
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:42,828
Eddie, darling!

191
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:44,121
Hedda.

192
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:46,582
New hat.

193
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:47,958
Ah, daily, darling, daily.

194
00:11:49,627 --> 00:11:51,796
Been to the movies lately, Dalton?

195
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:55,841
Duke. Now, wasn't he magnificent?

196
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:58,511
Just saying what needs saying. Hi, Eddie.

197
00:11:59,345 --> 00:12:00,471
Duke.

198
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:02,139
I hear you and your pals got a pamphlet.

199
00:12:02,598 --> 00:12:04,308
- Any takers?
- Not yet.

200
00:12:05,476 --> 00:12:07,478
Uh, would you like one, sir?
We're communists.

201
00:12:09,105 --> 00:12:11,023
He's a writer.

202
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:13,401
You won't get any takers.
Not here, anyway.

203
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:14,819
Oh, why is that?

204
00:12:14,944 --> 00:12:19,073
All it says is that Congress
has no right to investigate

205
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:21,992
how we vote or where we pray,

206
00:12:22,118 --> 00:12:25,162
what we think, say or how we make movies.

207
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:27,915
Hello, I'm Dalton Trumbo.

208
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:32,086
Congress has the right to go after
anything they think is a threat.

209
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:36,173
Well, that's where we disagree
and that's the point.

210
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:38,801
We both have the right to be wrong.

211
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:43,013
You wanna talk about rights,
first tell me whose side you're on.

212
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:44,765
Russia's no friend, not anymore.

213
00:12:44,849 --> 00:12:45,891
You'd better wake up.

214
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:49,562
'Cause it's a new day. A new day!

215
00:12:50,062 --> 00:12:51,063
And?

216
00:12:52,523 --> 00:12:54,191
And maybe it's not for your kind.

217
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:57,570
My kind? What kind is that?

218
00:12:57,695 --> 00:13:01,031
The kind that has no idea
why we just won a war.

219
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:05,202
It's curious, that's the second time
you mentioned that.

220
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:08,414
See, I was a war correspondent in Okinawa.

221
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:11,542
Hedda's son was stationed
in the Philippines.

222
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:15,045
Eddie was in Europe with
the Office of War Information.

223
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:17,047
Where did you serve again?

224
00:13:18,424 --> 00:13:19,508
You trying to say something?

225
00:13:19,592 --> 00:13:21,343
No, Duke, he wasn't.

226
00:13:21,427 --> 00:13:22,678
Stay out of it, Eddie.

227
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:27,016
If you're going to talk about World War II
as if you personally won it,

228
00:13:27,099 --> 00:13:30,144
let's be clear where you were stationed.

229
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:34,440
On a film set, shooting blanks,
wearing makeup.

230
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:38,444
And if you're going to hit me,
I would like to take off my glasses.

231
00:13:40,738 --> 00:13:42,698
Duke, come on. Let's get out of here.

232
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:47,536
Thank you, Dalton. My next
column just wrote itself.

233
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,330
It's a good thing you didn't
want to demonize anybody

234
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:51,248
or else that could have been awkward.

235
00:13:53,042 --> 00:13:54,502
Manny wouldn't say "amorous."

236
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:55,628
Hang on one second.

237
00:13:55,753 --> 00:13:58,547
Paul, two packs, please.

238
00:13:58,631 --> 00:14:00,966
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

239
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:02,218
Here you go.

240
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:12,603
Good God, she's everywhere.

241
00:14:12,728 --> 00:14:17,149
Your next deal's gonna make you
the highest-paid writer in Hollywood.

242
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:19,818
Which will make you
the highest-paid writer in the world.

243
00:14:20,611 --> 00:14:21,654
You earned it.

244
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:24,907
You don't just write happy endings,
you actually believe them.

245
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,159
That's what people pay to see.

246
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:29,578
That's why you belong here
at MGM. Right, L.B.?

247
00:14:29,662 --> 00:14:33,791
I hate to make the wooing too easy
for you, but where do I sign?

248
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:39,588
Just one thing.

249
00:14:39,672 --> 00:14:41,590
If you're gonna work for me,

250
00:14:41,674 --> 00:14:45,928
I never, ever want to see
anything like this again.

251
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:50,933
You won't. I promise.

252
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:52,017
Good.

253
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:54,353
Just stop reading Hedda Hopper.

254
00:15:00,985 --> 00:15:02,361
So, what did L.B. say then?

255
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:04,321
Jesus, don't.

256
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:07,116
I haven't eaten since.
My job's not hard enough?

257
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,577
Your job is not hard at all.

258
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:13,539
You think getting Mayer to sign you
after those headlines was easy?

259
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:18,502
You have a record-breaking
three-year contract to make shit up.

260
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:20,170
You're welcome.

261
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:26,802
Oh, honey, not now.

262
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:27,928
Please, Mom?

263
00:15:28,012 --> 00:15:29,638
She really can.

264
00:15:29,722 --> 00:15:30,889
- Ask her!
- Can what?

265
00:15:31,015 --> 00:15:32,600
Cleo, is this true?

266
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:34,059
Watch this.

267
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:37,104
- Trumbo...
- Come on.

268
00:15:40,232 --> 00:15:41,567
Of course, you realize this means war.

269
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:42,693
Behold!

270
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,862
I had a very unusual mother.

271
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:46,864
Translation: stage mother.

272
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:52,703
The misspent youth of a child acrobat.

273
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:55,831
My God, how long were you
in show business?

274
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:58,375
Till I was 15, but it was more
show forced-labor.

275
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,172
- Bravo!
- Brilliant!

276
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:14,516
Mr. Dalton Trumbo?

277
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:16,560
Yes?

278
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:20,439
I'll see you in Washington.

279
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:28,697
Enjoy your picnic.

280
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:30,658
Let's go, boys.

281
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:31,742
Yes, Mr. Stripling, sir.

282
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:38,374
Nineteen subpoenas have
been issued to those we believe

283
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:42,044
have knowledge of the ongoing
communist threat in Hollywood.

284
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:43,504
What kind of threat is that?

285
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:46,465
A conspiracy to corrupt democratic values

286
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,467
and bring about
the overthrow of this nation.

287
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:50,761
Using movies?

288
00:16:50,886 --> 00:16:52,471
Any movie in particular or...

289
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:55,391
Movies are the most powerful
influence ever created.

290
00:16:55,808 --> 00:16:59,311
And they are infested
with hidden traitors.

291
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:04,191
The House Un-American Activities
Committee has been formed to investigate

292
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:07,069
alleged communists working in Hollywood.

293
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:10,447
The newsreel cameras and an army
of newspapermen are on hand.

294
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:13,701
Mr. Reagan, has it been reported to you

295
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:16,704
that certain members of the Screen
Actors Guild are communists?

296
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:20,165
There has been a small group
more or less following the tactics

297
00:17:20,249 --> 00:17:24,044
that we, uh, associate
with the Communist Party.

298
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:27,673
And would you refer to them
as a disrupting influence?

299
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:31,719
I would say that, at times, they have
attempted to be a disruptive influence.

300
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:34,012
Do you believe that
the motion picture industry

301
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:36,056
is doing everything it can to rid itself

302
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,600
of subversive un-American influences?

303
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:40,936
No. The communists are everywhere.

304
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:43,480
They report directly to Moscow.

305
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:47,818
On numerous occasions,
communist agitators have tried hard

306
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:49,486
to steer us into the red river.

307
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:52,698
We had a little too much weight for that.

308
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:55,659
Will you name a few of these agitators?

309
00:17:57,161 --> 00:18:00,289
Well, Irving Pichel,

310
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:03,208
Edward Dmytryk, Frank Tuttle.

311
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:06,879
If I had my way about it,
they'd all be sent back to Russia

312
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:09,465
or some other unpleasant place.

313
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:13,510
We get our chance
to testify in three days.

314
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:17,181
And what we're about to do
won't make us too popular.

315
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:19,558
Okay, so we get slandered and then what?

316
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:23,437
You answer every question
they ask in your own way.

317
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:25,731
So, don't tell them shit.

318
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:27,191
Beautifully put.

319
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:28,484
Well, you know what they call that?

320
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:29,693
Yes.

321
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:34,406
In all likelihood, we'll be cited
for contempt of Congress.

322
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:36,533
There will be a trial.

323
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:38,118
What am I missing here?

324
00:18:38,202 --> 00:18:39,620
All I'm hearing is jail.

325
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:40,788
Not necessarily.

326
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:45,125
In a lower court, yes,
we'll most likely lose.

327
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:47,127
- But on appeal...
- It'll work.

328
00:18:47,211 --> 00:18:50,297
The Supreme Court is
a five-to-four liberal majority.

329
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,216
They think this committee
is unconstitutional.

330
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:53,383
They want it killed.

331
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:55,469
Sounds great.

332
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:57,387
I'm out.

333
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,641
Niki.

334
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:07,856
Look, I can't afford this stuff
you guys are talking about.

335
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,650
The Supreme Court and legal fees...

336
00:19:10,234 --> 00:19:12,277
You know, Dorothy's not gonna...

337
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:14,696
I mean, things already
aren't great, but you know...

338
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:18,659
If I dump all my savings into that,
she's gone with the kids.

339
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:20,077
I'll cover you.

340
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:24,289
Expenses, travel, legal fees, everything.

341
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,668
You don't even like me.

342
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:31,922
I like you fine. You don't like me.

343
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:40,806
No, you know what it is?
I don't trust you.

344
00:19:40,931 --> 00:19:43,308
Well, I'd say go on,
but I'm afraid you will.

345
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:45,227
Look, I know what I am. Okay?

346
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,521
I want this whole country
to be different, top to bottom.

347
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:50,691
If I get what I want,
nobody gets their own lake.

348
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:52,818
Well, that would be a very
dull life, don't you think?

349
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:53,902
Yeah, for you.

350
00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:55,612
Not for the guys who built this.

351
00:19:56,154 --> 00:20:00,576
If I'm wrong, tell me, but ever since
I've known you, you talk like a radical.

352
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:02,661
But you live like a rich guy.

353
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:05,205
That is true.

354
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:06,915
Well, I don't know that you're...

355
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:10,294
I don't think you're willing to lose
all of this just to do the right thing.

356
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:17,092
Well, I despise martyrdom
and I won't fight for a lost cause.

357
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:18,302
So you're right.

358
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:20,637
I'm not willing to lose it all.
Certainly not them.

359
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:24,850
But I am willing to risk it all.

360
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:28,896
That's where the radical and the rich guy
make a perfect combination.

361
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:32,733
The radical may fight with
the purity of Jesus.

362
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:35,861
But the rich guy wins with
the cunning of Satan.

363
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:38,780
Oh, shit.

364
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:40,240
What?

365
00:20:40,324 --> 00:20:44,369
Just please shut up. Please.

366
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:46,663
I'll do whatever you want.

367
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:49,333
Just please don't say shit
like that anymore.

368
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:56,423
I can't guarantee that.

369
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:00,427
In Washington,
10 of the original 19 subpoenaed

370
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:04,556
began their testimony before the House
Un-American Activities Committee.

371
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:06,808
Mr. Trumbo, raise your right hand.

372
00:21:06,892 --> 00:21:09,061
Do you solemnly swear the testimony
you are about to give

373
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:11,438
is the truth, the whole truth,
nothing but the truth so help you God?

374
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:12,981
I do.

375
00:21:13,065 --> 00:21:14,441
Sit down, please.

376
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:16,818
Mr. Trumbo, now I shall ask you

377
00:21:16,902 --> 00:21:21,198
a series of various questions all of which
can be answered with a yes or a no.

378
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,370
Well, I shall answer yes or no
if I please to answer.

379
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:29,122
I shall answer in my own words.

380
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:34,169
Many questions can be answered yes
or no only by a moron or a slave.

381
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:35,796
That's enough!

382
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:37,547
Are you refusing to answer the question?

383
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:40,759
Mr. Chairman, I will refuse to answer
none of your questions.

384
00:21:40,884 --> 00:21:44,888
Are you now or have you ever been
a member of the Communist Party?

385
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:46,890
May I introduce to evidence...

386
00:21:46,974 --> 00:21:48,141
No. No! You are out of order!

387
00:21:48,225 --> 00:21:50,268
- ...my work, my screenplays...
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

388
00:21:50,394 --> 00:21:52,729
...by which you are
making this determination?

389
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:54,272
No, the chair will rule.

390
00:21:54,398 --> 00:21:56,066
- It's critical to...
- No, just a minute.

391
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:57,651
Your screenplays are too long.

392
00:21:57,734 --> 00:21:59,569
I've heard that before.

393
00:21:59,653 --> 00:22:03,115
Are you now or have you ever been
a member of the Communist Party?

394
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:06,284
Am I accused of a crime?

395
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:07,536
You're not asking the questions.

396
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:10,330
If so, I believe I have
the right to be confronted

397
00:22:10,414 --> 00:22:13,583
with any evidence
that supports this question.

398
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:14,793
Are you refusing to answer the...

399
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:16,420
I should very much like
to see what you have.

400
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:19,214
Oh, you would? You will see very soon!

401
00:22:19,297 --> 00:22:20,590
Good!

402
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:21,842
The witness is excused.

403
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:24,344
You believe this committee has
the right to compel testimony.

404
00:22:24,428 --> 00:22:26,304
You are dismissed, sir!
Witness is dismissed!

405
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,973
To indict opinion,
to criminalize thought...

406
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:29,266
Guard, take him out!

407
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:30,600
...but that right does not exist, sir!

408
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:31,893
Order!

409
00:22:31,977 --> 00:22:34,021
And the moment it does, God help us all!

410
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:35,647
This is typical communist tactic!

411
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:38,316
This is the beginning of an
American concentration camp!

412
00:22:38,442 --> 00:22:39,651
Order!

413
00:22:40,027 --> 00:22:41,486
Uh, state your name, please.

414
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:43,864
Arlen Hird. I'm a screenwriter.

415
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:46,700
You understand, sir, that if you
don't answer my questions,

416
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:48,577
I can hold you in contempt of Congress?

417
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,370
I didn't refuse yet, did I?

418
00:22:50,454 --> 00:22:53,123
Are you now or have you ever been
a member of the Communist Party?

419
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:57,044
Well, I'd like to answer you, Congressman,
but I need to consult with my physician.

420
00:22:57,127 --> 00:22:58,128
- Your physician?
- Yes.

421
00:22:58,211 --> 00:22:59,212
I don't understand.

422
00:22:59,296 --> 00:23:01,715
To find out if he can surgically
remove my conscience.

423
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:04,468
This is a hostile witness.

424
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:07,554
This is typical communist tactics.

425
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:18,440
Arlen. Arlen, what is it?

426
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:23,487
It's cancer.

427
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:24,905
What?

428
00:23:26,865 --> 00:23:28,158
Jesus...

429
00:23:30,494 --> 00:23:31,828
How long have you known?

430
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:35,040
- Three months.
- Months?

431
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:36,374
Mmm-hmm.

432
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:39,461
Are you receiving treatment?

433
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:41,755
Uh, I don't like the options.

434
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:45,050
It's lung cancer.

435
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:46,927
Bad if you operate, bad if you don't.

436
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,932
Well, is there anything I can do for you?

437
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:56,728
No! No, it's cancer.

438
00:23:56,853 --> 00:23:57,854
Yeah, but...

439
00:23:57,938 --> 00:23:59,356
Jesus.

440
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:02,943
You want to do something?
Make sure this plan works.

441
00:24:03,944 --> 00:24:05,445
I'm out of options.

442
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:26,424
We were so young.
We thought we knew everything.

443
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,051
We did.

444
00:24:28,135 --> 00:24:29,553
No, not me.

445
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:33,056
No, I didn't realize how much
I loved it all

446
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:37,060
until I reached a certain age,
and the roles started drying up.

447
00:24:37,144 --> 00:24:39,563
I remember thinking, "Now what do you do

448
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:42,190
"when you love something
but it stops loving you back?"

449
00:24:42,274 --> 00:24:43,400
You fight.

450
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:47,320
No, no, no. You love it more
until it surrenders.

451
00:24:48,738 --> 00:24:52,075
Hedda, you never left MGM or my heart.

452
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,997
How's your boy?

453
00:24:57,122 --> 00:24:58,498
Fine. Fine.

454
00:24:58,582 --> 00:24:59,875
Still in the navy?

455
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,251
Yes, he's First Lieutenant.

456
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:03,753
You raised a real hero.

457
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:05,422
Which is why I would like to tell him

458
00:25:05,505 --> 00:25:08,258
that we are doing as much
for this country as he is.

459
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:10,552
It's complicated.

460
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:13,597
Trumbo, the others, all have contracts.

461
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:19,436
Oh, L.B., you helped build
this business as did I.

462
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:21,897
We're not gonna watch
these pissants defile it.

463
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:25,275
I'm running a studio here, Hedda.

464
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:27,819
You think I love every person
on my payroll?

465
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:29,529
Grow up.

466
00:25:30,864 --> 00:25:35,535
Then how about I make it crystal clear
to my 35 million readers

467
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:40,290
exactly who runs Hollywood
and won't fire these traitors?

468
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:45,462
How about I name names? Real names.

469
00:25:45,545 --> 00:25:51,259
Jacob Warner, Jack Warner.
Schmuel Gelbfisz, Sam Goldwyn.

470
00:25:51,343 --> 00:25:54,429
And of course, yours. Lazar Meir.

471
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:55,972
You watch what you say to me!

472
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:58,892
Forty years ago, you were
starving in some shtetl.

473
00:25:58,975 --> 00:26:02,562
The greatest country on Earth
takes you in, gives you wealth, power.

474
00:26:02,646 --> 00:26:05,565
But the second we need you,
you do nothing.

475
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:08,151
And that's exactly what my readers expect

476
00:26:08,235 --> 00:26:10,695
from a business run by kikes.

477
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,821
Get out!

478
00:26:15,158 --> 00:26:17,410
You know, L.B., I am fond of you.

479
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:20,997
Some of my happiest years
were spent on this lot.

480
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:23,500
Not in your office, of course.

481
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:25,877
You were always trying
to fuck me on the couch.

482
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:29,005
Me, trying to maintain my virtue...
Barely.

483
00:26:29,673 --> 00:26:30,924
But times change.

484
00:26:31,508 --> 00:26:33,510
Now I'd happily fuck you.

485
00:26:38,598 --> 00:26:42,811
All studios unanimously agree
to discharge the Hollywood Ten

486
00:26:42,894 --> 00:26:45,397
without compensation,
effective immediately.

487
00:26:45,522 --> 00:26:50,110
No studio will ever employ
a member of the Communist Party

488
00:26:50,193 --> 00:26:52,320
or anyone refusing to cooperate

489
00:26:52,404 --> 00:26:55,365
in our struggle
with this terrible new menace.

490
00:26:55,907 --> 00:27:00,370
He's been loved by film fans
for almost 20 years.

491
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:04,291
But have you noticed he hasn't
been on-screen much lately?

492
00:27:04,374 --> 00:27:06,001
Bad box office?

493
00:27:06,084 --> 00:27:08,837
No. Bad politics.

494
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,549
Bad news indeed
for Mr. Edward G. Robinson.

495
00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:14,384
Thank you so much for coming.

496
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:18,471
The Hollywood Ten are going
to court for all of us.

497
00:27:19,264 --> 00:27:21,224
It'll be long, expensive,

498
00:27:21,308 --> 00:27:24,978
so please give as much as you
can to the defense fund.

499
00:27:25,061 --> 00:27:27,063
Thank you for coming.

500
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:30,650
- Good night, my dear.
- Good luck.

501
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:31,901
- Good night, sir. Thank you.
- Bye-bye.

502
00:27:33,069 --> 00:27:35,697
Well, this little gathering
didn't quite have

503
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:38,283
the zip and zing of yesteryear, did it?

504
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:40,452
Where are all the liberals
all of a sudden?

505
00:27:40,577 --> 00:27:42,829
At their lawyers' or psychiatrists'.

506
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:44,331
Hmm, likely both.

507
00:27:45,832 --> 00:27:47,000
For the defense fund.

508
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:48,251
Eddie...

509
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:50,545
Have you been working?

510
00:27:50,628 --> 00:27:52,922
Eh. It's a bit slow.

511
00:27:56,134 --> 00:27:57,135
You sold one.

512
00:27:58,928 --> 00:28:00,138
Oh, the van Gogh.

513
00:28:01,598 --> 00:28:03,433
Got a good price.

514
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:04,809
Eddie...

515
00:28:06,269 --> 00:28:09,064
Dear God, look at this.
Eddie, I can't let you do...

516
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:10,482
I'll be fine, kid, take it.

517
00:28:10,607 --> 00:28:13,276
No, it's too much. It's just too much.

518
00:28:15,987 --> 00:28:17,280
Take it.

519
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:21,201
Eddie, I...

520
00:28:21,284 --> 00:28:23,995
Everything that you have...

521
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:28,416
What he's trying to say
is that he loves you.

522
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,962
I love him too, the warty son of a bitch.

523
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,801
Got a great offer on the Monet
if you want to bribe the jury.

524
00:28:40,136 --> 00:28:43,681
In the matter of the United States
v. Dalton Trumbo,

525
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:48,478
we find the defendant guilty
of contempt of Congress.

526
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,899
Mr. Trumbo! Mr. Trumbo!

527
00:28:54,234 --> 00:28:56,277
I'll meet you in the car.

528
00:28:56,361 --> 00:28:58,321
Mr. Trumbo, are you
in contempt of Congress?

529
00:28:58,405 --> 00:29:00,824
Well, I have total contempt
of this Congress.

530
00:29:00,907 --> 00:29:03,368
I just thought the jury would see why.

531
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:07,622
The Supreme Court will drop kick
this verdict into speeding traffic

532
00:29:07,705 --> 00:29:10,708
and end the most shameful chapter
in Congressional history.

533
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:12,794
Now, that's it, boys.
We have nothing else.

534
00:29:12,877 --> 00:29:14,045
No, we're done, we're done.

535
00:29:14,546 --> 00:29:16,131
How are you doing for money?

536
00:29:16,214 --> 00:29:18,758
Broke as a bankrupt's bastard. Why?

537
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:22,762
Well, you owe me $30,000,
and this appeal's gonna be twice that.

538
00:29:22,846 --> 00:29:24,305
Well, I'd better get to work.

539
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:27,934
Doing what? You have no talent
to do anything else.

540
00:29:28,852 --> 00:29:30,728
Hollywood fights back!

541
00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:33,523
This is Gregory Peck.

542
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:35,233
A state of near hysteria

543
00:29:35,358 --> 00:29:38,820
over so-called communists in this country
threatens the freedom of other citizens.

544
00:29:40,071 --> 00:29:42,782
So the Un-American Committee
bears its tragic fruit.

545
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:45,368
This is Lucille Ball.

546
00:29:45,743 --> 00:29:50,290
All of us agree that the Constitution
of the United States must be defended.

547
00:29:50,373 --> 00:29:54,961
But the way to do this is not by
shutting up the man you disagree with.

548
00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:58,173
You must fight for his right
to speak and be heard.

549
00:29:58,256 --> 00:30:00,884
All civil liberties go hand in hand.

550
00:30:00,967 --> 00:30:03,011
And when one goes,
the others are weakened.

551
00:30:03,094 --> 00:30:05,013
Just as a collapse
of one pillar in a house

552
00:30:05,096 --> 00:30:07,056
would endanger the whole structure.

553
00:30:18,401 --> 00:30:20,403
We'll send you home in a couple of days.

554
00:30:22,238 --> 00:30:25,200
Well, it sounds like you're going to live.

555
00:30:25,283 --> 00:30:28,119
Yeah, they got me just
well enough to go to prison.

556
00:30:30,622 --> 00:30:31,748
How do you feel?

557
00:30:32,582 --> 00:30:36,252
Breathing with one lung,
which is half as good as two.

558
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:41,633
Look, Arlen, I heard about Dorothy.

559
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:43,885
Yeah, she took off.

560
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:47,096
Her timing was always amazing.

561
00:30:48,598 --> 00:30:50,058
I'm sorry.

562
00:30:50,141 --> 00:30:53,269
No, well, I know. I mean,
how could you leave all this?

563
00:30:56,856 --> 00:30:58,650
How's it going out there?

564
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:01,861
Everyone envies you.

565
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:06,741
Well, why wouldn't they?

566
00:31:06,824 --> 00:31:08,785
I got the best room in the joint.

567
00:31:09,953 --> 00:31:11,955
You should know. You paid for it.

568
00:31:13,873 --> 00:31:16,084
- Congratulations, Buddy.
- Thank you, fellas.

569
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:18,586
Who needs the studios?
I am strictly independent.

570
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:21,464
Got cans of film,
wads of Wall Street dough,

571
00:31:21,548 --> 00:31:24,259
and my favorite boss, me.

572
00:31:24,342 --> 00:31:25,843
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

573
00:31:29,722 --> 00:31:31,307
And you, you crazy son of a bitch,

574
00:31:31,391 --> 00:31:34,811
you're gonna write all of my movies
once this Washington crap clears up.

575
00:31:35,979 --> 00:31:37,480
And how will that happen?

576
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,023
I'm not political, thank Jesus.

577
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:41,943
If they called me in,
accused me, I'd just say,

578
00:31:42,026 --> 00:31:43,987
"Yup, did it. Sorry, didn't mean it."

579
00:31:44,821 --> 00:31:46,656
So Congress then asks,

580
00:31:46,739 --> 00:31:49,659
"Are you now or have you ever
been a Democrat?"

581
00:31:51,077 --> 00:31:55,832
I am and, God, I just feel awful about it.

582
00:31:57,083 --> 00:32:00,670
Then they want the names
of other Democrats.

583
00:32:00,753 --> 00:32:03,256
Bill and Earl, Nate, Tom.

584
00:32:06,301 --> 00:32:08,094
Then I say, "Go to hell."

585
00:32:08,678 --> 00:32:10,346
Really?

586
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:13,308
How many banks fund enemies of the state?

587
00:32:14,684 --> 00:32:18,354
Your money's gone unless you give
the names of your friends here.

588
00:32:18,438 --> 00:32:22,358
They'll never work again,
but it's the only way you ever will.

589
00:32:27,655 --> 00:32:30,450
We all know each other, our families.

590
00:32:31,826 --> 00:32:32,869
We're friends.

591
00:32:35,163 --> 00:32:37,290
What would you do, Buddy?

592
00:32:41,836 --> 00:32:43,713
Only you.

593
00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:45,965
Piss on the best day of a guy's life.

594
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:48,217
Only you!

595
00:32:54,682 --> 00:32:56,559
Christ's sakes.

596
00:32:57,727 --> 00:33:00,146
According to the protocol set forth...

597
00:33:05,735 --> 00:33:07,737
And what does she say?

598
00:33:09,739 --> 00:33:11,741
What does the princess say?

599
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:22,085
Shit... Shit!

600
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,174
Shouldn't be any likeness...

601
00:33:28,383 --> 00:33:30,718
It concerns me a little bit.

602
00:33:32,428 --> 00:33:34,764
Oh, good morning, Nikola.

603
00:33:35,098 --> 00:33:37,558
I thought you weren't allowed
to write anymore.

604
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:43,690
Ah. No. No, just not allowed
to put my name on it,

605
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,608
or get paid.

606
00:33:45,775 --> 00:33:47,193
How does that work?

607
00:33:50,238 --> 00:33:51,739
Not very well.

608
00:33:52,949 --> 00:33:56,786
It's funny. It's breezy and romantic.

609
00:33:57,286 --> 00:33:58,371
Who wrote it?

610
00:33:58,454 --> 00:34:01,582
You did, old boy.

611
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:03,793
You stick your name on my labor,

612
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,629
hand it in to your studio
and we're in business.

613
00:34:06,796 --> 00:34:10,925
Look, it is just dumb luck that I wasn't
subpoenaed and blacklisted myself.

614
00:34:11,092 --> 00:34:12,635
The hearings are going
to start up again soon.

615
00:34:12,802 --> 00:34:14,762
I'm going to get called and canned.

616
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:16,222
Well, then quick, lad.

617
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:19,559
Let's sell this little beauty
and split the take, 50-50.

618
00:34:19,892 --> 00:34:23,312
Ridiculous. I'll take 10%.

619
00:34:23,646 --> 00:34:27,650
You'll take 20. No, 30!
And that's my final offer.

620
00:34:27,942 --> 00:34:29,485
You're the worst businessman ever.

621
00:34:29,569 --> 00:34:30,570
Mmm.

622
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,280
I hate the title.

623
00:34:32,405 --> 00:34:33,823
Me too.

624
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:36,117
Really? What's wrong with it?

625
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,952
- The Princess and the Peasant.
- Yes.

626
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:40,496
God, please, Trumbo,
it sounds like a puppet show.

627
00:34:41,497 --> 00:34:42,623
Well, then, change it.

628
00:34:42,749 --> 00:34:43,833
I did.

629
00:34:47,754 --> 00:34:50,006
Really? You think this title's better?

630
00:34:50,089 --> 00:34:52,091
Roman Holiday.

631
00:34:52,467 --> 00:34:53,843
I like it.

632
00:34:54,302 --> 00:34:55,553
Who invited you?

633
00:34:55,678 --> 00:34:57,013
I did.

634
00:34:57,513 --> 00:34:59,515
She's my favorite Trumbo.

635
00:35:00,183 --> 00:35:04,520
I'm introducing legislation so in
the event of a national emergency,

636
00:35:05,104 --> 00:35:08,024
all communists will be sent
to internment camps.

637
00:35:08,191 --> 00:35:09,859
And the president supports this?

638
00:35:09,942 --> 00:35:11,110
He better.

639
00:35:11,277 --> 00:35:15,031
Parnell, I need to speak to you privately
about your employees.

640
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:16,991
Excuse me, gentlemen.

641
00:35:18,201 --> 00:35:21,871
As I said, Bob, these are legitimate
salaried employees from my home state.

642
00:35:22,038 --> 00:35:24,540
What you didn't tell me is
that every one of them is a relative.

643
00:35:24,707 --> 00:35:25,792
Which is completely legal.

644
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:28,377
Except that none of them pay taxes.

645
00:35:28,711 --> 00:35:30,880
Don't say anything else without a lawyer.

646
00:35:40,223 --> 00:35:41,849
- No.
- Mrs. Trumbo.

647
00:35:42,475 --> 00:35:43,893
Mrs. Trumbo! Hi.

648
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,478
Jeff.

649
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:48,481
Ma'am, I gotta get paid.

650
00:35:48,731 --> 00:35:50,608
Oh. I'm so sorry.

651
00:35:50,733 --> 00:35:52,693
I got men with families.

652
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:55,404
My husband hasn't been able
to get any work.

653
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,073
We owe everyone.

654
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,075
- Ma'am, please.
- I'm so...

655
00:35:59,242 --> 00:36:03,579
Cleo, we're rich!

656
00:36:04,747 --> 00:36:06,541
There you are, Jeffrey.

657
00:36:07,124 --> 00:36:09,877
You people sure live exciting lives.

658
00:36:10,753 --> 00:36:12,922
Well, I thank you. Appreciate it.

659
00:36:13,047 --> 00:36:14,423
Thank you, Betty!

660
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,259
We did it, Cleo!

661
00:36:16,384 --> 00:36:19,053
We sold Roman Holiday! Paramount.

662
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,597
Our beloved Ian is just...

663
00:36:21,931 --> 00:36:22,932
Why, what's the matter?

664
00:36:23,057 --> 00:36:24,058
Judge Rutledge died.

665
00:36:24,225 --> 00:36:26,310
No, no, that was Judge Murphy
who died last month.

666
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:27,478
And Rutledge.

667
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:29,272
Last night.

668
00:36:36,821 --> 00:36:38,114
Mmm.

669
00:36:38,573 --> 00:36:40,783
Oh, now...

670
00:36:42,118 --> 00:36:46,247
Everything will be all right. You'll see.

671
00:36:47,415 --> 00:36:49,709
Without a liberal majority on the court,

672
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:52,420
our appeal's gonna be denied.

673
00:36:53,629 --> 00:36:57,633
Meaning we should all be
prepared to go to prison.

674
00:37:06,517 --> 00:37:10,813
I wouldn't change anything going back.
Not one thing.

675
00:37:13,691 --> 00:37:15,985
Let's ask each other in a year.

676
00:37:27,121 --> 00:37:28,372
Will you do me a favor?

677
00:37:28,706 --> 00:37:30,958
Hold on to this while I'm gone.

678
00:37:32,627 --> 00:37:34,045
Thank you, dear.

679
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,383
Your mother needs to laugh
at least once a day.

680
00:37:39,675 --> 00:37:40,801
Deal?

681
00:37:40,927 --> 00:37:42,011
Okay.

682
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:46,223
Where's that little pumpkin seed?

683
00:37:56,525 --> 00:37:57,860
- To the Hollywood Ten!
- Thank you.

684
00:38:04,367 --> 00:38:05,910
To the Hollywood Ten!

685
00:38:07,036 --> 00:38:08,537
You're heroes!

686
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:46,075
28 cents. Gold lighter.

687
00:38:46,909 --> 00:38:50,454
Wallet. Cigarette case.

688
00:38:55,042 --> 00:38:56,085
Raise your hands.

689
00:38:57,628 --> 00:39:00,423
Open your mouth. Wider.

690
00:39:01,048 --> 00:39:04,593
Turn your head to the right. To the left.

691
00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:06,971
Tilt your head back.

692
00:39:08,431 --> 00:39:10,099
Spread your legs.

693
00:39:12,393 --> 00:39:14,603
Grab your sack and skin it back.

694
00:39:16,731 --> 00:39:18,107
Turn around.

695
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,736
Spread your cheeks.

696
00:39:23,946 --> 00:39:27,241
Squat. Cough.

697
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:32,121
Turn around.

698
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:36,125
Move out.

699
00:39:37,501 --> 00:39:38,794
Next!

700
00:39:47,344 --> 00:39:49,638
So the warden says I gotta do right.

701
00:39:49,805 --> 00:39:51,474
Boy want a better job?

702
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,976
I put him in charge of
the whole goddamn supply room.

703
00:39:54,143 --> 00:39:55,686
'Cause I know something the warden don't.

704
00:40:04,987 --> 00:40:08,657
Truck's unloaded.
Driver needs a signature.

705
00:40:20,336 --> 00:40:24,173
Actually, uh, he needs it right here.

706
00:40:34,725 --> 00:40:39,230
You know, if, uh... If you need any help,

707
00:40:39,396 --> 00:40:42,900
I used to run shipping at a...
At a bakery.

708
00:40:43,901 --> 00:40:45,319
Heard you's a writer.

709
00:40:45,444 --> 00:40:46,862
Well, that too.

710
00:40:47,029 --> 00:40:48,531
And a commie.

711
00:40:49,824 --> 00:40:52,201
What the fuck is wrong with you people?

712
00:40:52,576 --> 00:40:53,869
This is a great country.

713
00:40:53,994 --> 00:40:55,246
Agreed.

714
00:40:57,039 --> 00:40:58,374
You type?

715
00:41:05,214 --> 00:41:06,423
Stop.

716
00:41:10,344 --> 00:41:13,180
Well, now, if only I could read it.

717
00:41:19,687 --> 00:41:23,065
"Protocol as to return of goods.

718
00:41:23,732 --> 00:41:27,236
"There shall be triplicate
copies of Form 14-A filed

719
00:41:27,403 --> 00:41:30,573
"with Supply, Shipping
and Office of the Warden."

720
00:41:32,616 --> 00:41:34,618
You think you're gonna
teach me the alphabet

721
00:41:34,785 --> 00:41:37,079
and I'm gonna shake your hand
all grateful and say,

722
00:41:37,246 --> 00:41:40,207
"Thank you, Mr. Trumbo.
You done change my life, sir.

723
00:41:40,291 --> 00:41:42,042
"I'll never forget you."

724
00:41:46,422 --> 00:41:51,051
I got 20 years for killing me
a white man who tried to rob my bar.

725
00:41:51,302 --> 00:41:54,096
I did it and I'd do it again.

726
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:59,268
You look down on me and I will fuck you
up like you've never been fucked up

727
00:41:59,393 --> 00:42:02,730
in your whole bullshit Beverly Hills life.

728
00:42:03,272 --> 00:42:06,442
Now I'm here trying to build
my time and make parole.

729
00:42:06,734 --> 00:42:08,611
You wanna help make that happen?

730
00:42:13,824 --> 00:42:17,494
Welcome to fucking Supply, Comrade.

731
00:42:24,335 --> 00:42:28,464
Dear Cleo, I don't
count the days or hours...

732
00:42:29,131 --> 00:42:30,966
I count the seconds.

733
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:36,597
Sometimes I think I'll die
of boredom. Other times, fear.

734
00:42:37,181 --> 00:42:38,807
Not of this place.

735
00:42:38,933 --> 00:42:42,186
So far, its challenges
are all surmountable.

736
00:42:42,436 --> 00:42:45,147
Augmented by days of lovely boredom.

737
00:42:45,314 --> 00:42:49,026
So flat and calm in the wake
of all that churning

738
00:42:49,193 --> 00:42:51,487
ugly luckless battle.

739
00:42:52,655 --> 00:42:56,992
No, my fear is for what
will happen when I get out.

740
00:42:57,451 --> 00:43:00,120
To our family and our country.

741
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:04,333
Not all the news is worrisome.

742
00:43:04,833 --> 00:43:09,004
Some reminds me that what the
imagination can't conjure

743
00:43:09,546 --> 00:43:12,007
reality delivers with a shrug.

744
00:43:12,216 --> 00:43:16,845
And reality has delivered
in all its beatific wonder

745
00:43:17,012 --> 00:43:21,350
to the federal penal system,
J. Parnell Thomas,

746
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:24,353
convicted of tax evasion.

747
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:28,649
Well, look at us.
Just a couple of jailbirds.

748
00:43:29,692 --> 00:43:32,653
Except you actually committed a crime.

749
00:43:37,658 --> 00:43:40,202
Yet in all this,

750
00:43:40,661 --> 00:43:45,666
I know I'm the luckiest
unlucky man ever to live,

751
00:43:46,208 --> 00:43:49,878
because you and the children warm, feed,

752
00:43:50,045 --> 00:43:53,424
clothe, pacify, and rejuvenate me

753
00:43:54,008 --> 00:43:56,218
by never leaving my heart.

754
00:43:57,052 --> 00:44:01,432
Love, Prisoner Number 7551.

755
00:44:07,021 --> 00:44:10,733
We're not gonna take that hill
from the Japs with bullets,

756
00:44:10,899 --> 00:44:12,776
bombs or fists.

757
00:44:12,901 --> 00:44:13,861
Yeah!

758
00:44:13,944 --> 00:44:15,112
We're gonna take it with blood.

759
00:44:15,529 --> 00:44:18,240
Whoever spills more, loses.

760
00:44:18,782 --> 00:44:20,868
And we don't lose.

761
00:44:21,201 --> 00:44:22,328
Do we?

762
00:44:22,453 --> 00:44:23,579
No!

763
00:44:30,919 --> 00:44:32,087
You lose.

764
00:44:32,254 --> 00:44:33,922
That's what I thought.

765
00:44:39,053 --> 00:44:40,888
You know John Wayne?

766
00:44:41,013 --> 00:44:42,806
I do.

767
00:44:44,892 --> 00:44:47,102
What's he like?

768
00:44:47,227 --> 00:44:49,396
You'd love each other.

769
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,610
Isn't he beautiful? Okay.

770
00:44:56,612 --> 00:44:58,238
- Mom, I got a new one.
- Huh?

771
00:45:00,949 --> 00:45:02,451
Okay, wait.

772
00:45:03,494 --> 00:45:05,746
Come on, you're gonna scare the horse.

773
00:45:05,954 --> 00:45:08,457
Mom, you'd better come quick!

774
00:45:08,957 --> 00:45:11,835
Edward Robinson,
are you now or have you ever been

775
00:45:11,919 --> 00:45:13,462
a member of the Communist Party?

776
00:45:13,629 --> 00:45:17,800
I'm not now, sir, nor have I
ever been a member of that party.

777
00:45:17,966 --> 00:45:20,928
I have always been a Liberal Democrat.

778
00:45:21,095 --> 00:45:22,763
But in your home over the years,

779
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:25,182
there have been political
meetings attended by those

780
00:45:25,265 --> 00:45:26,642
that we now know to be communists.

781
00:45:26,809 --> 00:45:30,771
Yes, sir. Yes, that has now
been made clear to me.

782
00:45:31,188 --> 00:45:34,024
There were tremendous activities

783
00:45:34,149 --> 00:45:35,484
- and fundraisers...
- Shit.

784
00:45:35,609 --> 00:45:37,778
...that went on in my house
during the war.

785
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,697
I did not know then

786
00:45:40,823 --> 00:45:44,034
all of their true affiliations

787
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:46,286
or the work that they were up to.

788
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:50,374
It never entered my mind that any
of these people were communists.

789
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:55,963
I was duped and used. I was lied to.

790
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:57,589
But who used you?

791
00:45:57,714 --> 00:45:59,174
Well, um...

792
00:45:59,675 --> 00:46:01,051
These sinister forces

793
00:46:01,176 --> 00:46:04,388
who probably ran these organizations.

794
00:46:04,555 --> 00:46:07,516
Oh, tell us the individuals
that you have reference to.

795
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:16,358
Mr. Robinson?

796
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:22,698
Well, uh, you had Albert Maltz.

797
00:46:24,241 --> 00:46:25,576
Um...

798
00:46:26,368 --> 00:46:30,706
I knew Frank Tuttle and that other fellow.

799
00:46:30,873 --> 00:46:32,624
That top fellow

800
00:46:32,708 --> 00:46:36,044
who they say is the, uh,
commissar out there. Um...

801
00:46:36,378 --> 00:46:37,713
Arlen Hird?

802
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,214
Yes, yes, Arlen Hird.

803
00:46:40,007 --> 00:46:41,633
I didn't know Dmytryk at all.

804
00:46:41,758 --> 00:46:43,385
I'm a commissar now.

805
00:46:43,552 --> 00:46:47,556
Ian McLellan Hunter...

806
00:46:49,349 --> 00:46:53,020
...and, uh, Dalton Trumbo.

807
00:46:55,063 --> 00:46:56,482
Thank you, Mr. Robinson.

808
00:46:56,565 --> 00:46:58,066
Thank you, sir.

809
00:46:58,233 --> 00:47:00,736
Mr. Chairman, I have no further questions.

810
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:03,697
Snitch like that in here,

811
00:47:04,531 --> 00:47:07,075
you end up fucking dead.

812
00:47:17,794 --> 00:47:20,047
Eddie ought to go back to work.
He did what he had to.

813
00:47:20,214 --> 00:47:22,925
No, no, he did what he was forced to do.

814
00:47:23,258 --> 00:47:25,469
Well, the point is, he did it.

815
00:47:26,762 --> 00:47:30,098
Brave men and boys are fighting
this battle against communism.

816
00:47:30,265 --> 00:47:33,560
They are sacrificing in ways
we can't even imagine.

817
00:47:33,936 --> 00:47:36,438
And you wanna talk about some
asshole's movie career?

818
00:47:36,939 --> 00:47:39,566
I'd see Eddie Robinson
and everyone like him dead

819
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:42,986
if it'd bring back one boy
from Korea. Just one.

820
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,780
So what are you saying?

821
00:47:44,905 --> 00:47:47,115
Guys like Eddie cooperate and get nothing?

822
00:47:47,783 --> 00:47:49,284
That isn't right.

823
00:47:49,409 --> 00:47:50,827
Careful, Duke.

824
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:52,496
Or what, Hedda?

825
00:47:54,414 --> 00:47:58,001
If I'm not careful, what?

826
00:47:58,585 --> 00:48:01,421
I had no idea you were such a softie.

827
00:48:01,755 --> 00:48:05,467
That's me all right. All cuddles.

828
00:48:13,267 --> 00:48:14,935
Proud of ya, Eddie.

829
00:48:15,018 --> 00:48:17,646
Wasn't easy, I know. But you did good.

830
00:48:18,605 --> 00:48:19,940
Thanks, Duke.

831
00:48:20,315 --> 00:48:23,527
I'm gonna call the studios.
The offers will pour in.

832
00:48:29,366 --> 00:48:30,826
Sure.

833
00:48:34,663 --> 00:48:35,831
Thanks.

834
00:48:46,466 --> 00:48:49,344
One of the greatest peacetime
spy dramas in the nation's history

835
00:48:49,469 --> 00:48:53,807
reaches its climax, as Julius and Ethel
Rosenberg are sentenced to death

836
00:48:54,141 --> 00:48:57,185
for revealing atomic secrets
to Soviet Russia.

837
00:48:58,395 --> 00:49:00,647
The junior senator from
Wisconsin, Joseph McCarthy,

838
00:49:01,023 --> 00:49:04,026
is ramping up his investigation
into alleged communists he believes

839
00:49:04,192 --> 00:49:07,195
are infiltrating our government,
our military, and our schools.

840
00:49:07,362 --> 00:49:12,242
...because the enemy has been able
to get the traitors and dupes

841
00:49:12,409 --> 00:49:15,037
to do his work within our government.

842
00:49:15,704 --> 00:49:17,914
One communist on the faculty

843
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:21,251
of one university
is one communist too many.

844
00:49:21,668 --> 00:49:23,962
A man is either loyal or he's disloyal.

845
00:49:30,177 --> 00:49:31,553
Thank you, Billy.

846
00:50:38,453 --> 00:50:40,038
They're here! They're here! Dad!

847
00:50:40,122 --> 00:50:41,790
Dad! They're home!

848
00:50:45,794 --> 00:50:49,423
I'm being attacked by giants! Ah!

849
00:50:49,506 --> 00:50:52,384
What have you beautiful creatures
done with my little ones?

850
00:50:52,467 --> 00:50:53,468
Oh, Dad, we missed you.

851
00:50:53,593 --> 00:50:56,179
- Christopher. Mitzi.
- Hi, Dad.

852
00:50:56,972 --> 00:50:58,306
My goodness.

853
00:50:58,932 --> 00:51:00,809
Nikola, look at you.

854
00:51:00,934 --> 00:51:02,811
She got real tall.

855
00:51:03,812 --> 00:51:05,105
Oh, is that lipstick?

856
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:06,523
Dad...

857
00:51:08,191 --> 00:51:11,319
Oh, I've missed you so much. All of you.

858
00:51:12,904 --> 00:51:14,406
Let's go inside. I wanna hear everything.

859
00:51:27,002 --> 00:51:29,212
Oh, I'm terribly sorry...

860
00:51:29,504 --> 00:51:34,384
Oh, Buddy! Well, how are you?

861
00:51:35,469 --> 00:51:37,179
I got nothing to say to you.

862
00:51:44,394 --> 00:51:46,313
Looks like prison has given us the plague.

863
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:50,734
Yeah, well, that Buddy Ross,
he was always an asshole.

864
00:51:51,067 --> 00:51:52,152
Yeah.

865
00:51:52,277 --> 00:51:53,361
He's in trouble too.

866
00:51:53,904 --> 00:51:55,697
- Three movies, three flops.
- Oh, really?

867
00:51:55,822 --> 00:51:56,907
Mmm-hmm.

868
00:51:57,532 --> 00:51:59,993
Look at him. He's trying to sell his soul,
but he can't find it.

869
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:05,207
I just hope he stays afloat long enough
to get the shit sued out of him.

870
00:52:05,373 --> 00:52:07,542
Oh, really? By whom?

871
00:52:08,043 --> 00:52:09,294
By me and you and all of us.

872
00:52:09,377 --> 00:52:10,545
Jeez...

873
00:52:10,712 --> 00:52:12,589
We use their capitalist system
against them...

874
00:52:12,756 --> 00:52:14,841
In civil court. We go after their money.

875
00:52:15,008 --> 00:52:16,551
- No. No. No.
- For what they did to us!

876
00:52:16,718 --> 00:52:18,261
We make them swear under oath...

877
00:52:18,386 --> 00:52:20,222
No, no, no. Christ!

878
00:52:20,388 --> 00:52:22,891
Haven't you spent enough time in court?

879
00:52:23,058 --> 00:52:25,101
I know I have. Jesus Christ.

880
00:52:25,268 --> 00:52:26,895
Well, what else are we supposed to do?

881
00:52:28,271 --> 00:52:32,526
We do the one thing
everyone says we can't.

882
00:52:36,071 --> 00:52:39,616
Look, you're a great writer. We make shit.

883
00:52:39,741 --> 00:52:41,243
I don't see it.

884
00:52:42,285 --> 00:52:44,329
Mr. King, I'm a screenwriter.

885
00:52:44,412 --> 00:52:46,540
If I couldn't write shit, I'd starve.

886
00:52:46,623 --> 00:52:48,416
Trumbo, we can't afford you.

887
00:52:49,584 --> 00:52:54,339
Well, how much did you pay
for the script of that?

888
00:52:54,422 --> 00:52:56,758
Bad Men of Tombstone

889
00:52:59,594 --> 00:53:00,762
$1,200.

890
00:53:02,597 --> 00:53:06,852
All right. I'll write you
a movie for $1,200, then.

891
00:53:06,935 --> 00:53:08,645
And you don't want your name on it?

892
00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:10,981
No, you don't want my name on it.

893
00:53:11,106 --> 00:53:12,440
You got that right.

894
00:53:13,024 --> 00:53:17,028
Especially if you're still,
you know, up to stuff.

895
00:53:17,112 --> 00:53:18,196
Are you?

896
00:53:18,697 --> 00:53:20,156
Perpetually.

897
00:53:21,491 --> 00:53:23,118
Jesus.

898
00:53:23,618 --> 00:53:24,786
You got any ideas?

899
00:53:25,954 --> 00:53:28,623
Well, I just got out of prison.

900
00:53:28,707 --> 00:53:30,333
What about crime?

901
00:53:30,458 --> 00:53:33,128
A story of a gangster, his rise and fall.

902
00:53:33,211 --> 00:53:34,838
I've seen that a few times.

903
00:53:34,963 --> 00:53:36,798
Because it always makes money.

904
00:53:36,882 --> 00:53:39,009
All right, when do I get my goods?

905
00:53:40,051 --> 00:53:41,303
Three days.

906
00:53:41,386 --> 00:53:43,763
A 100-page screenplay in three days?

907
00:53:43,847 --> 00:53:45,599
Are you trying to fuck me?

908
00:53:45,682 --> 00:53:47,726
'Cause if you fuck me, I will fuck you.

909
00:53:48,977 --> 00:53:51,146
Mr. King, I've heard this speech.

910
00:53:52,731 --> 00:53:54,649
It was better in jail.

911
00:54:31,019 --> 00:54:32,020
"No, boss...

912
00:54:33,855 --> 00:54:34,940
"He..."

913
00:54:40,028 --> 00:54:43,615
Are you kidding me with this?
Hymie, get out here!

914
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:49,913
Hymie, pay the man!
He's a genius. Beautiful.

915
00:54:50,038 --> 00:54:53,792
Wait a minute, look.
We got Killer in the Swamp.

916
00:54:53,875 --> 00:54:56,378
The best character's the swamp. Oh, oh.

917
00:54:56,544 --> 00:54:57,545
Women in Prison.

918
00:54:57,629 --> 00:54:59,172
Dames fighting in their underwear.

919
00:54:59,255 --> 00:55:01,466
It's perfect, except it stinks.

920
00:55:01,549 --> 00:55:02,592
What else, Hymie?

921
00:55:02,717 --> 00:55:03,802
Pirates. Can't afford the ocean.

922
00:55:04,219 --> 00:55:05,220
That's it.

923
00:55:05,804 --> 00:55:06,930
Fix them all.

924
00:55:07,055 --> 00:55:10,058
You want more, we got more. Oh, baby!

925
00:55:14,229 --> 00:55:16,523
So, what do you think
of the new neighborhood?

926
00:55:16,606 --> 00:55:18,108
- I like it.
- Yeah, this is nice.

927
00:55:18,233 --> 00:55:19,609
- Yeah, Dad.
- Well...

928
00:55:24,322 --> 00:55:26,241
It's gonna be good being in town.

929
00:55:28,410 --> 00:55:30,120
Whoa, look at that!

930
00:55:35,291 --> 00:55:38,003
- I brought you some lemonade.
- Thank you.

931
00:55:38,086 --> 00:55:39,546
Hard work. You holding up okay?

932
00:55:39,629 --> 00:55:41,256
- Pretty good.
- All right, thank you.

933
00:55:49,806 --> 00:55:50,974
We forgot the towels!

934
00:55:51,099 --> 00:55:53,643
Oh, shoot! Wait for me. Wait for me.

935
00:56:21,463 --> 00:56:23,131
Mitzi... Shh!

936
00:56:41,149 --> 00:56:47,655
Well, there are many angry
and ignorant people in the world.

937
00:56:49,157 --> 00:56:52,160
They seem to be breeding
in record numbers.

938
00:56:53,244 --> 00:56:55,580
Now, all we can do as a family

939
00:56:55,663 --> 00:57:00,085
is stick together and remain vigilant.

940
00:57:14,557 --> 00:57:16,434
The Mouth of Truth.

941
00:57:16,518 --> 00:57:20,063
Legend is that if you're given to lying,
and you put your hand in there,

942
00:57:20,188 --> 00:57:22,273
it'll be bitten off.

943
00:57:22,524 --> 00:57:24,275
Oh, what a horrid idea!

944
00:57:25,068 --> 00:57:26,111
Let's see you do it.

945
00:57:31,407 --> 00:57:33,284
Let's see you do it.

946
00:57:35,370 --> 00:57:36,538
Sure.

947
00:57:49,592 --> 00:57:50,802
Hello.

948
00:57:50,885 --> 00:57:52,554
You beast!

949
00:57:53,555 --> 00:57:56,599
It's a huge hit. Great reviews.

950
00:57:56,724 --> 00:58:00,061
I haven't worked in nine months. You?

951
00:58:01,604 --> 00:58:03,398
Well, there aren't quite enough zeros

952
00:58:03,481 --> 00:58:07,152
in a King Brothers' salary to survive,

953
00:58:07,235 --> 00:58:10,572
but they need scripts like
an army needs toilet paper.

954
00:58:10,989 --> 00:58:14,701
Quality minimum, quantity maximum.

955
00:58:14,784 --> 00:58:19,080
You'd think that when the artistic ambitions
of a movie are non-existent,

956
00:58:19,164 --> 00:58:21,791
the work would be tossed off in a week.

957
00:58:21,916 --> 00:58:25,587
But consistently pleasing
two former pinball salesmen

958
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:28,464
turns out to be a high hurdle indeed.

959
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:31,718
And I've become a stranger
in my own house.

960
00:58:31,801 --> 00:58:36,806
Every workweek is seven days.
Every day is 18 hours.

961
00:58:36,931 --> 00:58:39,601
Every minute, I'm further behind.

962
00:58:40,602 --> 00:58:42,645
They need five of you.

963
00:58:46,191 --> 00:58:48,985
Okay, the only question
is, can these pinkos write?

964
00:58:49,110 --> 00:58:51,905
Well, the dapper gentleman
in the gray suit

965
00:58:51,988 --> 00:58:54,157
is Ian McLellan Hunter.

966
00:58:54,282 --> 00:58:55,408
Guy who wrote Roman Holiday.

967
00:58:55,491 --> 00:58:57,285
Guy who just got subpoenaed.

968
00:58:57,368 --> 00:58:59,787
Guy who just got nominated
for an Academy Award.

969
00:58:59,871 --> 00:59:02,540
Everyone at that table's been nominated.

970
00:59:03,333 --> 00:59:07,879
There's Alvah Bessie,
and Adrian Scott. Arlen Hird.

971
00:59:07,962 --> 00:59:11,966
And Ring Lardner, Jr.
and Albert Maltz and...

972
00:59:14,802 --> 00:59:16,304
Um...

973
00:59:16,387 --> 00:59:18,181
It'll be like this.

974
00:59:18,306 --> 00:59:20,558
I'll find the writer and work with him.

975
00:59:20,642 --> 00:59:22,602
He'll deliver the script to me.

976
00:59:22,685 --> 00:59:24,187
If it's good, I'll give it to you.

977
00:59:24,312 --> 00:59:27,357
If it needs work, I'll fix it.

978
00:59:27,815 --> 00:59:29,984
No one gets paid until you're happy.

979
00:59:30,068 --> 00:59:33,321
And these writers, they're...
They're all...

980
00:59:34,322 --> 00:59:35,990
I mean, they're all black...

981
00:59:36,074 --> 00:59:37,075
Blacklisted.

982
00:59:37,158 --> 00:59:38,618
Jesus, you're such a chicken-shit.

983
00:59:39,994 --> 00:59:41,955
You know, we're at war
with the communists.

984
00:59:42,038 --> 00:59:44,123
- No we're not.
- It's a new kind of war.

985
00:59:44,207 --> 00:59:46,000
Yeah, if it doesn't exist, very new.

986
00:59:46,501 --> 00:59:49,420
What about the Rosenbergs?

987
00:59:49,545 --> 00:59:50,588
They stole the atom bomb.

988
00:59:50,672 --> 00:59:53,174
They didn't steal it off
a fucking camera truck.

989
00:59:54,092 --> 00:59:57,262
So look, we bought a gorilla suit.

990
00:59:58,846 --> 01:00:00,056
We gotta use it.

991
01:00:04,352 --> 01:00:05,353
Oh.

992
01:00:06,604 --> 01:00:07,605
Well.

993
01:00:07,689 --> 01:00:09,274
So, you had five jobs.

994
01:00:09,357 --> 01:00:10,358
Mmm-hmm.

995
01:00:10,441 --> 01:00:12,402
And now we got them and now you got none?

996
01:00:12,527 --> 01:00:16,239
Oh, now I'm free to get five
more jobs and five more writers.

997
01:00:16,364 --> 01:00:20,326
And you each get five more jobs
and five more writers and so on.

998
01:00:20,410 --> 01:00:23,079
To keep that going, we'd have
to write every script in the business.

999
01:00:23,204 --> 01:00:27,166
Oh, Arlen, what a devious lad.

1000
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:31,170
So who wants to write a gorilla movie?

1001
01:00:31,254 --> 01:00:32,922
Who doesn't?

1002
01:00:33,047 --> 01:00:36,342
We now work at midnight

1003
01:00:36,426 --> 01:00:40,430
in thick fog among strangers.

1004
01:00:42,557 --> 01:00:43,933
Not literally.

1005
01:00:44,392 --> 01:00:46,311
We're running a family business.

1006
01:00:46,394 --> 01:00:48,980
We'll be adding new phone lines,

1007
01:00:49,063 --> 01:00:52,942
and when answering, never say,
"Trumbo residence."

1008
01:00:53,067 --> 01:00:57,322
I'll be writing for various producers
under different names.

1009
01:00:57,405 --> 01:00:59,782
Whomever they ask for, you come find me.

1010
01:00:59,907 --> 01:01:01,075
Or take a message.

1011
01:01:06,748 --> 01:01:07,915
Hello?

1012
01:01:08,041 --> 01:01:09,125
Is John Abbott there?

1013
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:10,752
No, sir, may I take a message?

1014
01:01:10,835 --> 01:01:14,130
The door must be answered at all hours.

1015
01:01:16,132 --> 01:01:19,260
Got a pickup for Sally Stubblefield.

1016
01:01:22,472 --> 01:01:24,015
Can I get your mom to sign?

1017
01:01:28,644 --> 01:01:29,687
Thank you.

1018
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:36,027
Dictation, shorthand
and typing will be learned.

1019
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:40,365
Those of legal age will have one
of the most important jobs imaginable.

1020
01:01:40,448 --> 01:01:41,449
Courier.

1021
01:01:42,367 --> 01:01:46,954
Scripts must be delivered to producers
without raising suspicion.

1022
01:01:47,038 --> 01:01:49,791
Any questions? Concerns?

1023
01:01:50,375 --> 01:01:52,377
- Yes, Nikola.
- Is there a schedule?

1024
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:53,503
A what?

1025
01:01:53,628 --> 01:01:54,712
I need to know when I can do homework.

1026
01:01:54,796 --> 01:01:58,132
And I'm part of a fundraising committee
for Negro voting rights.

1027
01:01:58,216 --> 01:02:01,552
Plus, every other Friday,
we have meetings for Student Council.

1028
01:02:01,636 --> 01:02:02,970
I'm... I have to...

1029
01:02:03,054 --> 01:02:05,056
Niki, we'll figure
something out, sweetheart.

1030
01:02:05,807 --> 01:02:06,808
Won't we?

1031
01:02:08,851 --> 01:02:12,522
And protests continued
as the Supreme Court may soon take up

1032
01:02:12,647 --> 01:02:14,649
the issue of racial segregation.

1033
01:02:14,982 --> 01:02:19,028
Negros in Southern towns and cities have
taken to the streets in large numbers.

1034
01:02:19,153 --> 01:02:22,490
All under close scrutiny
by local law enforcement.

1035
01:02:22,573 --> 01:02:26,369
There have been unconfirmed reports
of disturbances and rioting.

1036
01:02:26,494 --> 01:02:30,289
But it is not clear if the violence
was initiated by protesters...

1037
01:02:30,373 --> 01:02:31,916
Nikola!

1038
01:02:32,041 --> 01:02:33,584
...or white vigilante groups.

1039
01:02:33,709 --> 01:02:36,295
Beyond the South, through the nation...

1040
01:02:36,379 --> 01:02:38,673
Now, there you go.

1041
01:02:38,756 --> 01:02:41,008
A few mistakes, not many.

1042
01:02:41,551 --> 01:02:42,593
All right.

1043
01:02:42,677 --> 01:02:45,513
...all top-salaried government officials

1044
01:02:45,596 --> 01:02:48,015
should make a full public statement
of their income...

1045
01:02:48,349 --> 01:02:51,519
This concludes our program
scheduled for today.

1046
01:03:16,627 --> 01:03:19,630
Which one is Graham Tauper?

1047
01:03:21,382 --> 01:03:22,842
Nympho Nun.

1048
01:03:22,925 --> 01:03:24,051
Oh.

1049
01:03:24,177 --> 01:03:25,261
Great job.

1050
01:03:26,095 --> 01:03:29,515
Uh, Elwood Carr, Murder at the Circus.

1051
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:31,476
It needs work. I knew the clown did it.

1052
01:03:31,559 --> 01:03:33,227
It's always the clown.

1053
01:03:34,395 --> 01:03:36,939
So you are The Alien and the Farm Girl.

1054
01:03:37,064 --> 01:03:38,065
Yeah.

1055
01:03:38,649 --> 01:03:42,111
So you wrote the alien talking
about the rights of the worker.

1056
01:03:42,778 --> 01:03:44,947
The pathology of capitalism.

1057
01:03:45,573 --> 01:03:48,159
The complacency of the bourgeoisie.

1058
01:03:48,242 --> 01:03:50,703
I don't even know what it is
and I fucking hate it.

1059
01:03:50,786 --> 01:03:52,538
Well, the idea was to use the...

1060
01:03:52,622 --> 01:03:54,248
I paid you to write a script about

1061
01:03:54,332 --> 01:03:58,878
a guy with a giant bug head
shtupping a girl in a hayloft.

1062
01:03:58,961 --> 01:04:00,129
And you write shit

1063
01:04:00,254 --> 01:04:03,674
that's gonna get me
subpoenaed, and stinks!

1064
01:04:04,967 --> 01:04:06,302
Fix it!

1065
01:04:07,136 --> 01:04:08,638
Well, fuck Frank King.

1066
01:04:08,763 --> 01:04:11,516
I said, until he's happy, I'd rewrite.

1067
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:15,269
So you're gonna stay up
with that all night, for that crap?

1068
01:04:15,353 --> 01:04:16,354
For what?

1069
01:04:16,437 --> 01:04:19,023
To get it to his high literary
and political standards?

1070
01:04:19,106 --> 01:04:22,818
Well, it shouldn't be to anyone's
political standards.

1071
01:04:22,944 --> 01:04:25,655
It's The Alien and the Farm Girl,
for Christ's sake.

1072
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:27,114
What the hell were you thinking?

1073
01:04:27,198 --> 01:04:28,533
I was thinking.

1074
01:04:28,616 --> 01:04:32,036
That's why I'm a writer.
To say things that matter.

1075
01:04:32,119 --> 01:04:33,454
Remember that?

1076
01:04:33,538 --> 01:04:37,667
I was a reporter. I was
nominated for a Pulitzer.

1077
01:04:37,792 --> 01:04:41,128
I fought in Spain,
and I know Ernest Hemingway.

1078
01:04:41,212 --> 01:04:43,965
- I actually... I know him.
- Oh, bullshit.

1079
01:04:44,048 --> 01:04:45,174
And he knows me.

1080
01:04:45,299 --> 01:04:47,677
If I walked into a bar in Paris, he...

1081
01:04:47,802 --> 01:04:49,136
Maybe not my name, but he'll...

1082
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:50,263
I'll get a wave.

1083
01:04:50,346 --> 01:04:51,681
Yeah.

1084
01:04:51,806 --> 01:04:54,809
You... You won the
National fucking Book Award.

1085
01:04:55,393 --> 01:04:56,852
I mean, what are we doing?

1086
01:05:01,524 --> 01:05:02,525
Okay, so the alien...

1087
01:05:03,484 --> 01:05:05,570
The alien impregnates the farm girl.

1088
01:05:05,653 --> 01:05:06,737
- Right.
- Why?

1089
01:05:06,821 --> 01:05:10,283
Because he wants to inseminate her
and propagate a new species

1090
01:05:10,366 --> 01:05:11,534
- on Earth and take over?
- No.

1091
01:05:11,659 --> 01:05:15,162
Because she reminds him
of the girl he left behind.

1092
01:05:15,746 --> 01:05:16,789
But he's got a bug head.

1093
01:05:16,872 --> 01:05:19,000
His girlfriend's probably got
a bug head back home.

1094
01:05:19,083 --> 01:05:21,294
You don't get hung up
on the looks of someone.

1095
01:05:21,377 --> 01:05:22,837
He's falling in love with her.

1096
01:05:23,838 --> 01:05:25,256
Uh, okay.

1097
01:05:25,339 --> 01:05:27,592
You're over-thinking.

1098
01:05:32,263 --> 01:05:34,098
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1099
01:05:34,181 --> 01:05:35,891
You want to do this later?

1100
01:05:36,017 --> 01:05:37,685
No. Go, please.

1101
01:05:40,855 --> 01:05:42,231
All right.

1102
01:05:42,356 --> 01:05:46,444
I mean, do you ever miss
writing something...

1103
01:05:46,527 --> 01:05:47,903
Forget great, just good?

1104
01:05:49,196 --> 01:05:52,033
I mean, you must have ideas still, right?

1105
01:05:52,908 --> 01:05:54,702
I've got a few.

1106
01:05:54,785 --> 01:05:57,705
There's one that won't go away.

1107
01:05:57,788 --> 01:06:03,502
Cleo and I are in Mexico
at a bullfight years ago.

1108
01:06:03,586 --> 01:06:06,589
And the bull dies.

1109
01:06:06,756 --> 01:06:11,010
And, uh, thousands of people
are just cheering.

1110
01:06:11,093 --> 01:06:12,928
Three weren't.

1111
01:06:13,054 --> 01:06:17,933
Cleo, me and this young boy down front,

1112
01:06:19,935 --> 01:06:21,604
crying.

1113
01:06:23,981 --> 01:06:26,108
Always wondered why.

1114
01:06:28,110 --> 01:06:30,488
Well, you write it and you'll know.

1115
01:06:32,615 --> 01:06:37,411
But please promise me,
not for Frank fucking King.

1116
01:06:38,663 --> 01:06:39,914
Please.

1117
01:06:41,582 --> 01:06:45,294
To present the writing awards,
here is an actor who also reads.

1118
01:06:45,378 --> 01:06:46,796
Mr. Kirk Douglas.

1119
01:06:46,879 --> 01:06:49,840
Niki, hurry!

1120
01:06:49,924 --> 01:06:52,009
Who's doing it?

1121
01:06:52,093 --> 01:06:53,427
Kirk Douglas!

1122
01:06:53,552 --> 01:06:54,887
I'm coming, I'm coming!

1123
01:06:58,891 --> 01:07:00,184
The envelope.

1124
01:07:02,436 --> 01:07:05,648
And the Oscar goes to

1125
01:07:05,731 --> 01:07:08,567
Roman Holiday by Ian McLellan Hunter.

1126
01:07:08,651 --> 01:07:12,905
Yes! That's you, Dad, that's you!

1127
01:07:12,988 --> 01:07:15,199
Dad, that is fantastic!

1128
01:07:19,537 --> 01:07:22,623
This is accepted on behalf
of Ian McLellan Hunter.

1129
01:07:22,707 --> 01:07:24,917
So do we get to be happy now?

1130
01:07:36,303 --> 01:07:38,889
I don't want it.

1131
01:07:38,973 --> 01:07:40,933
Well, I don't want it.

1132
01:07:41,016 --> 01:07:42,309
Your name's on it.

1133
01:07:43,644 --> 01:07:44,770
You wrote it.

1134
01:07:45,187 --> 01:07:46,731
They gave it to you.

1135
01:07:48,816 --> 01:07:50,860
And it's done me wonders.

1136
01:07:52,611 --> 01:07:54,321
Here's the gorilla script.

1137
01:07:54,947 --> 01:07:55,948
Huh.

1138
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:57,533
- Hey, Dad.
- Ah?

1139
01:07:57,616 --> 01:07:59,201
Phone for you.

1140
01:07:59,326 --> 01:08:00,953
For which name?

1141
01:08:01,036 --> 01:08:03,414
No, you. Some guy named Buddy Ross.

1142
01:08:03,497 --> 01:08:04,498
Huh.

1143
01:08:06,208 --> 01:08:11,088
So, is the rumor true?
You wrote Roman Holiday?

1144
01:08:13,924 --> 01:08:15,968
What can I do for you, Buddy?

1145
01:08:16,594 --> 01:08:20,848
My movies have all bombed.
Dug me into a hole.

1146
01:08:20,931 --> 01:08:22,767
I finally got something going.

1147
01:08:22,850 --> 01:08:23,976
Classy.

1148
01:08:24,059 --> 01:08:27,521
Three big stars. The script...

1149
01:08:29,231 --> 01:08:32,109
What script? There is no script.

1150
01:08:32,193 --> 01:08:34,653
I got 11 writers who fucked me
and now the actors are gonna pull out.

1151
01:08:34,737 --> 01:08:38,699
And if they do, I lose everything.

1152
01:08:39,325 --> 01:08:41,702
When do you shoot?

1153
01:08:41,786 --> 01:08:43,120
Ten days.

1154
01:08:44,371 --> 01:08:45,790
Is there anything?

1155
01:08:52,129 --> 01:08:54,924
There'd be no credit, obviously.

1156
01:08:55,007 --> 01:08:57,009
I can't pay you till we start shooting.

1157
01:09:00,638 --> 01:09:03,474
I wouldn't blame you
if you spit in my face.

1158
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:06,977
But we did good stuff back then.

1159
01:09:08,437 --> 01:09:09,980
We really did.

1160
01:09:13,776 --> 01:09:15,110
Please.

1161
01:09:17,905 --> 01:09:22,159
I owe the King Brothers a rewrite.

1162
01:09:22,243 --> 01:09:23,869
And I can't do both.

1163
01:09:25,079 --> 01:09:27,706
Here it is. I need you to take over.

1164
01:09:28,916 --> 01:09:30,709
So you can help that
great guy, Buddy Ross.

1165
01:09:30,793 --> 01:09:31,794
Mmm-mmm.

1166
01:09:31,877 --> 01:09:34,129
So we can keep tearing down the blacklist.

1167
01:09:34,213 --> 01:09:36,340
Oh, Jesus, here we go.

1168
01:09:36,423 --> 01:09:39,051
This is going to be a very big movie,
and if Buddy gets a good script...

1169
01:09:39,134 --> 01:09:40,135
Which you're gonna give him.

1170
01:09:40,219 --> 01:09:41,846
No, which I am going to sell him.

1171
01:09:41,929 --> 01:09:43,472
For money, 'cause that's why
we did all of this, right?

1172
01:09:43,556 --> 01:09:44,598
Was for the money.

1173
01:09:44,682 --> 01:09:46,976
Why can you not see this?

1174
01:09:47,059 --> 01:09:51,230
If we get one big movie,
we can get all the big movies.

1175
01:09:51,313 --> 01:09:54,567
And then this whole rotten thing
could collapse on the sheer irony

1176
01:09:54,650 --> 01:09:57,194
that every unemployable
writer is employed.

1177
01:09:57,278 --> 01:09:59,446
Jesus Christ, do you
have to say everything

1178
01:09:59,530 --> 01:10:01,824
like it's going to be
chiseled into a rock?

1179
01:10:01,907 --> 01:10:04,201
I'm not gonna help you help Buddy Ross!

1180
01:10:04,285 --> 01:10:05,744
God's sake!

1181
01:10:05,828 --> 01:10:07,454
- You are against every...
- No, I...

1182
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:09,915
- ...solid idea that comes up.
- Let's do something!

1183
01:10:09,999 --> 01:10:11,667
These fuckers did things!

1184
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:14,962
We should be suing that
cockroach into the ground

1185
01:10:15,087 --> 01:10:17,131
- along with those congressmen...
- There's an idea.

1186
01:10:17,214 --> 01:10:18,215
- Yes, and the producers!
- Very good one.

1187
01:10:18,299 --> 01:10:19,717
- Yes, and the studios!
- That'll be better.

1188
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,677
- We should sue them!
- Oh, yes, brilliant!

1189
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:24,179
Keep losing. Give all of your money
away to lawyers!

1190
01:10:24,263 --> 01:10:25,848
I'd rather lose for the right reasons.

1191
01:10:25,931 --> 01:10:27,016
Why?

1192
01:10:27,099 --> 01:10:29,393
It's still losing.

1193
01:10:29,476 --> 01:10:34,315
You lose. I lose. We all lose!

1194
01:10:34,398 --> 01:10:36,233
Don't you see that?

1195
01:10:36,317 --> 01:10:39,862
And the whole goddamn country
stays scared and dead.

1196
01:10:40,529 --> 01:10:42,990
Well, you really think you can
go on living like this forever?

1197
01:10:43,073 --> 01:10:44,867
Well, I'm not gonna have to.

1198
01:10:47,745 --> 01:10:51,665
Arlen, we can do this.

1199
01:10:51,749 --> 01:10:54,001
We can beat them. We can win!

1200
01:10:54,084 --> 01:10:55,961
- I don't care if I win.
- Bullshit!

1201
01:10:56,045 --> 01:10:57,171
Everybody wants to win.

1202
01:10:57,254 --> 01:10:59,798
No, you want to win.
I want to change things.

1203
01:10:59,882 --> 01:11:02,593
- I want to win so that I can change things.
- No, you don't!

1204
01:11:02,676 --> 01:11:05,554
You want to win so that you can get
an Oscar with your name on it this time.

1205
01:11:05,638 --> 01:11:09,683
And so you can get more money that you
burn through, writing shit for idiots!

1206
01:11:09,767 --> 01:11:13,187
Why do I have to explain everything
to you like you're a fucking child?

1207
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:14,271
You don't have to.

1208
01:11:14,355 --> 01:11:15,648
- You really don't have to.
- Piss off!

1209
01:11:15,731 --> 01:11:18,317
You know, you do what you do
and that's fine for you.

1210
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,945
But don't pretend that
you getting your career back

1211
01:11:21,028 --> 01:11:23,864
is part of some great crusade
for mankind. Okay?

1212
01:11:23,948 --> 01:11:25,950
I'm doing this for everyone.

1213
01:11:29,244 --> 01:11:30,621
Arlen...

1214
01:11:43,676 --> 01:11:46,220
Fucking idiot.

1215
01:12:28,387 --> 01:12:32,391
Happy birthday to you

1216
01:12:32,474 --> 01:12:36,979
Happy birthday, dear Nikola

1217
01:12:37,688 --> 01:12:42,192
Happy birthday to you

1218
01:12:42,860 --> 01:12:44,403
Make a wish.

1219
01:12:45,070 --> 01:12:46,321
Ah.

1220
01:12:46,613 --> 01:12:47,990
I got it.

1221
01:12:48,615 --> 01:12:50,367
Sweet 16!

1222
01:12:50,451 --> 01:12:52,077
Get together with your sister.

1223
01:12:52,161 --> 01:12:53,328
Chris, get in there.

1224
01:12:53,704 --> 01:12:55,622
Ah. Thank you.

1225
01:12:55,706 --> 01:12:57,374
Are you sure we shouldn't go knock?

1226
01:12:58,208 --> 01:12:59,501
I'm sure.

1227
01:12:59,585 --> 01:13:00,794
He can't take five minutes?

1228
01:13:00,919 --> 01:13:02,087
Nope.

1229
01:13:03,047 --> 01:13:04,256
Two minutes?

1230
01:13:04,381 --> 01:13:05,549
Niki.

1231
01:13:05,632 --> 01:13:07,509
One minute.

1232
01:13:12,431 --> 01:13:13,849
Chris, would you please
get the good plates?

1233
01:13:13,932 --> 01:13:15,601
- Yes, Mom.
- Thank you.

1234
01:13:19,855 --> 01:13:21,106
Dad!

1235
01:13:22,983 --> 01:13:24,902
- Dad!
- Go away!

1236
01:13:26,403 --> 01:13:27,946
We're having birthday cake.

1237
01:13:28,030 --> 01:13:31,784
When you hear me working, you don't knock!

1238
01:13:31,867 --> 01:13:33,744
But it's my birthday.

1239
01:13:33,827 --> 01:13:36,121
You don't knock! Ever!

1240
01:13:36,205 --> 01:13:38,832
So the house is on fire,
you don't want to know?

1241
01:13:38,916 --> 01:13:42,669
I work in a bathtub, surrounded by water.

1242
01:13:42,753 --> 01:13:46,632
So I'm fairly certain that even
if the whole goddamn country was on fire,

1243
01:13:46,715 --> 01:13:50,135
that I could still function
as this family's personal slave.

1244
01:13:50,219 --> 01:13:52,971
And all I ask is to not be interrupted

1245
01:13:53,055 --> 01:13:56,308
for every little slice
of fucking birthday cake!

1246
01:13:57,559 --> 01:13:59,895
What? It's ridiculous!

1247
01:14:01,021 --> 01:14:04,399
Now I've lost my place. Christ's sake!

1248
01:14:09,071 --> 01:14:13,408
...sure, maybe you, uh,
get that long, happy life we all want.

1249
01:14:13,492 --> 01:14:16,203
But your eyes never really close again.

1250
01:14:16,286 --> 01:14:20,916
'Cause you spend that life
scared of every noise in the dark.

1251
01:14:20,999 --> 01:14:25,337
We both do.
I can't let you do this, Rocco.

1252
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:27,965
I'll just have to convince you I'm right.

1253
01:14:40,644 --> 01:14:45,023
After all, kid, what are friends for?

1254
01:15:01,456 --> 01:15:03,041
Don't defend him, okay?

1255
01:15:03,125 --> 01:15:05,169
He knows he's wrong.

1256
01:15:05,252 --> 01:15:07,462
He hasn't even apologized.

1257
01:15:07,546 --> 01:15:08,797
I think you surprised him.

1258
01:15:09,381 --> 01:15:11,842
He's not used to seeing
another adult in the house.

1259
01:15:11,925 --> 01:15:14,469
He has to be right all the time.

1260
01:15:14,553 --> 01:15:16,597
How do you stand it?

1261
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:19,016
Well, it's challenging sometimes,
especially lately.

1262
01:15:21,018 --> 01:15:23,437
Hey, why don't you come
downstairs with me?

1263
01:15:24,021 --> 01:15:25,397
I wanna show you something.

1264
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:32,905
You see my gloves?

1265
01:15:35,949 --> 01:15:37,284
Thank you.

1266
01:15:47,628 --> 01:15:49,713
Do you imagine that's his head?

1267
01:15:53,258 --> 01:15:56,011
No. But you can.

1268
01:16:11,235 --> 01:16:14,363
Niki, is that the script already?

1269
01:16:14,446 --> 01:16:15,447
Fantastic.

1270
01:16:15,948 --> 01:16:18,075
Ah. Tell your dad that...

1271
01:16:41,181 --> 01:16:45,060
Oh, hello. Um, I'm looking for Arlen Hird.

1272
01:16:45,143 --> 01:16:46,937
Mr. Trumbo, it's Andrew.

1273
01:16:47,938 --> 01:16:51,233
Good God! Look... Look at you!

1274
01:16:52,317 --> 01:16:55,821
Wow. Well, I'm certain your father

1275
01:16:55,904 --> 01:16:58,532
has told you some nasty things about me,

1276
01:16:58,615 --> 01:17:00,033
but I want to assure you,

1277
01:17:00,117 --> 01:17:02,828
they're all true.

1278
01:17:02,911 --> 01:17:05,163
Is, uh... Is he home?

1279
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:09,334
I'm sorry. I thought you knew.

1280
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:28,103
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you so much.

1281
01:17:32,107 --> 01:17:33,442
Andrew.

1282
01:17:35,485 --> 01:17:37,362
Joshua.

1283
01:17:37,446 --> 01:17:40,449
My dad left something for you.

1284
01:17:40,532 --> 01:17:41,658
It's a record.

1285
01:17:42,492 --> 01:17:45,245
Money that he owed you
and some other people.

1286
01:17:47,914 --> 01:17:50,292
I'm sorry. I wish we could pay you back.

1287
01:17:53,128 --> 01:17:54,421
Andrew, no.

1288
01:17:56,048 --> 01:17:57,591
I owed him.

1289
01:18:01,345 --> 01:18:03,305
The debts are all mine.

1290
01:18:05,932 --> 01:18:07,267
Thank you.

1291
01:18:29,331 --> 01:18:30,957
Well...

1292
01:18:31,083 --> 01:18:32,626
Hello, Eddie.

1293
01:18:35,796 --> 01:18:37,923
This is a bit of a surprise.

1294
01:18:42,969 --> 01:18:44,388
What can I do for you?

1295
01:18:45,055 --> 01:18:46,556
Arlen died.

1296
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:48,850
I heard. I was on location.

1297
01:18:53,980 --> 01:18:57,359
This is the money you gave us
for the defense fund.

1298
01:18:57,442 --> 01:18:59,694
It's everything that we owe you.
Arlen included.

1299
01:18:59,778 --> 01:19:02,030
No, now, that was a gift.

1300
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:04,324
We'd like it off our books.

1301
01:19:06,034 --> 01:19:09,287
What is this supposed to be?
Some kind of message?

1302
01:19:10,622 --> 01:19:13,959
What you and Arlen and the great
Hollywood Ten all think of me.

1303
01:19:19,548 --> 01:19:22,509
Fine. Fine. But first you're gonna listen.

1304
01:19:26,555 --> 01:19:28,682
After you went to jail,

1305
01:19:31,017 --> 01:19:33,353
I didn't work for a year.

1306
01:19:35,605 --> 01:19:38,024
No offers, not even an audition.

1307
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:43,196
People would see me, cross the street.

1308
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:44,364
People I loved.

1309
01:19:46,575 --> 01:19:48,493
People I made rich.

1310
01:19:50,287 --> 01:19:51,663
I sat in front of that committee.

1311
01:19:51,746 --> 01:19:54,332
Why? I didn't do anything.

1312
01:19:54,416 --> 01:19:57,878
None of us did anything.
We were all stupid babies.

1313
01:19:58,628 --> 01:20:01,590
With no business in any of it.

1314
01:20:02,799 --> 01:20:04,634
I just wanted my life back.

1315
01:20:06,303 --> 01:20:10,056
They had every name.
Yours, Arlen's, everybody's.

1316
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:14,394
I didn't give them anything
they didn't already have.

1317
01:20:14,478 --> 01:20:19,357
I ended it, is all. I just... I ended it!

1318
01:20:19,441 --> 01:20:25,197
Oh, Eddie, you don't
end something like this.

1319
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:29,242
By giving them what
they have no right to ask.

1320
01:20:29,326 --> 01:20:32,537
You're gonna tell me
how I should have handled it?

1321
01:20:33,580 --> 01:20:35,624
Like you handled Congress?

1322
01:20:37,083 --> 01:20:40,045
So you're saying that
you're proud of what you did?

1323
01:20:40,128 --> 01:20:43,924
Proud? Who the hell gets to be proud?

1324
01:20:44,007 --> 01:20:45,425
You. You do.

1325
01:20:45,509 --> 01:20:47,552
You with your fake names and your fronts.

1326
01:20:47,636 --> 01:20:49,012
You've got all the work you want.

1327
01:20:49,095 --> 01:20:52,098
I gotta go out in the world every day.

1328
01:20:52,182 --> 01:20:53,767
This is my work.

1329
01:20:56,061 --> 01:20:58,772
I've got nobody else to be.

1330
01:20:58,855 --> 01:21:00,941
I did what I had to.

1331
01:21:01,024 --> 01:21:03,109
You did what you wanted, Eddie.

1332
01:21:04,528 --> 01:21:06,530
And you did it for more.

1333
01:21:07,948 --> 01:21:10,867
More movies, more money,

1334
01:21:11,660 --> 01:21:14,663
more dead bullshit on your walls.

1335
01:21:22,462 --> 01:21:27,175
What I did, I did, but did you
ever wonder how many years

1336
01:21:27,259 --> 01:21:29,427
you hacked off Arlen's life?

1337
01:21:31,054 --> 01:21:34,641
To show the world
what a rebel genius you are.

1338
01:21:39,312 --> 01:21:41,231
You live with that!

1339
01:21:53,910 --> 01:21:55,662
Drinking alone?

1340
01:21:57,163 --> 01:21:58,331
Preferably.

1341
01:21:59,541 --> 01:22:02,085
And what are you up to these days?

1342
01:22:04,296 --> 01:22:08,133
You know, Hedda, another one
of these and I just may tell you.

1343
01:22:08,216 --> 01:22:09,801
Oh, then I'm buying.

1344
01:22:10,594 --> 01:22:11,845
Usual. Same again.

1345
01:22:12,012 --> 01:22:13,263
Yes, Miss Hopper.

1346
01:22:14,723 --> 01:22:17,100
Oh, come on, I hear the rumors.

1347
01:22:19,060 --> 01:22:22,314
Show me you're still in the game,
fighting the good fight.

1348
01:22:23,648 --> 01:22:25,525
Come on, rub my face in it.

1349
01:22:25,609 --> 01:22:27,902
Whisper a movie you've written in secret.

1350
01:22:27,986 --> 01:22:29,487
Maybe I've even heard of it.

1351
01:22:31,781 --> 01:22:33,116
Maybe you have.

1352
01:22:33,199 --> 01:22:36,119
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry...
I'm filming. It's crazy.

1353
01:22:36,202 --> 01:22:38,872
Buddy, do you know Dalton Trumbo?

1354
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,587
Yes, I believe we have
worked together before.

1355
01:22:45,670 --> 01:22:47,172
What was it? Was it MGM?

1356
01:22:47,255 --> 01:22:49,633
A million years ago.
Nice to see you again, Buddy.

1357
01:22:50,884 --> 01:22:52,677
I hear your new script's in trouble.

1358
01:22:52,761 --> 01:22:54,304
Maybe you should hire Dalton.

1359
01:22:54,387 --> 01:22:57,682
He used to be pretty good,
and price-wise, he'd be bargain basement.

1360
01:22:57,766 --> 01:23:01,227
Not that you'd ever do it.
Not after Buddy named names.

1361
01:23:03,188 --> 01:23:05,690
Oh, you didn't know?

1362
01:23:05,774 --> 01:23:07,901
Word was he had hired someone
he shouldn't have.

1363
01:23:07,984 --> 01:23:10,987
So he got subpoenaed. He had to testify.

1364
01:23:11,071 --> 01:23:13,657
Closed session. No press. Makes it easier.

1365
01:23:13,740 --> 01:23:15,659
So, he named you, of course.

1366
01:23:17,285 --> 01:23:20,038
Now he's been cleared.
Gets to make his movie.

1367
01:23:20,121 --> 01:23:22,707
In a way, thanks to you.

1368
01:23:27,962 --> 01:23:31,341
Drink, Buddy? You look as if you need one.

1369
01:23:32,092 --> 01:23:33,968
Can you believe it?

1370
01:23:34,052 --> 01:23:36,680
Democrats voting for segregation.

1371
01:23:36,763 --> 01:23:38,848
Oh, the Southern Dixie-crats.

1372
01:23:38,932 --> 01:23:41,309
We started a petition
for total integration.

1373
01:23:41,393 --> 01:23:42,477
There it is.

1374
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:44,020
I already have over 1,000 signatures.

1375
01:23:44,104 --> 01:23:47,857
Well, I'd be happy to make it 1,001.

1376
01:23:47,941 --> 01:23:49,776
And this is the new draft

1377
01:23:49,859 --> 01:23:53,238
that needs to be delivered
to Hymie King in Agoura.

1378
01:23:54,531 --> 01:23:56,950
Wait, Agoura? I thought
the Kings were in Hollywood.

1379
01:23:57,033 --> 01:23:58,702
Oh, no, no, no. These are the rewrites.

1380
01:23:58,785 --> 01:24:01,830
They're to be shot tonight, so Hymie
needs them on the set right away.

1381
01:24:01,913 --> 01:24:03,456
Agoura's 40 miles.

1382
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:05,625
Yes, I'm sure Chris knows that by now.

1383
01:24:05,709 --> 01:24:06,710
Well, he can't.

1384
01:24:08,378 --> 01:24:09,421
I'm sorry?

1385
01:24:09,504 --> 01:24:12,132
He has a date. He's taking her to a movie.

1386
01:24:12,215 --> 01:24:17,178
Well, all right, then, Nikola,
you'll deliver the draft.

1387
01:24:17,262 --> 01:24:18,263
I have a protest.

1388
01:24:18,346 --> 01:24:20,765
Since when do protests
have hard start times?

1389
01:24:21,433 --> 01:24:22,434
I'll take it.

1390
01:24:22,559 --> 01:24:23,560
Nikola will take it.

1391
01:24:23,643 --> 01:24:25,437
I said I can't.

1392
01:24:25,562 --> 01:24:27,313
Young lady, you will.

1393
01:24:27,397 --> 01:24:28,481
This is important.

1394
01:24:28,606 --> 01:24:29,649
So is this.

1395
01:24:29,733 --> 01:24:31,317
This is important to me.

1396
01:24:31,401 --> 01:24:34,863
And the date's important to Chris,
so figure something else out.

1397
01:24:44,330 --> 01:24:46,541
Move on! He needs those now!

1398
01:24:59,637 --> 01:25:01,347
Oh, honey...

1399
01:25:03,016 --> 01:25:06,853
She hasn't been gone that long,
and it's really not that late.

1400
01:25:10,190 --> 01:25:13,693
You know, this is a blatant attempt
to manipulate worry.

1401
01:25:20,450 --> 01:25:23,119
Do you know when I realized
that I had to leave Hal?

1402
01:25:23,203 --> 01:25:25,371
Hal? Hal who?

1403
01:25:25,455 --> 01:25:27,123
My first husband Hal.

1404
01:25:27,207 --> 01:25:29,334
Jesus, take the wheel!

1405
01:25:31,377 --> 01:25:32,879
It was my wedding night.

1406
01:25:34,005 --> 01:25:36,216
My first wedding night with Hal.

1407
01:25:36,299 --> 01:25:39,469
If we're going to go back in time
to that unholy coupling,

1408
01:25:39,552 --> 01:25:42,639
then I have a medical obligation to drink.

1409
01:25:43,056 --> 01:25:45,683
I saw this was not a man
I could have children with.

1410
01:25:46,017 --> 01:25:47,644
Now, thank God for that.

1411
01:25:47,727 --> 01:25:51,397
He'd bully me and them.

1412
01:25:51,523 --> 01:25:54,734
And that we'd wind up like
every miserable family since forever.

1413
01:25:55,693 --> 01:25:56,903
But you...

1414
01:25:58,029 --> 01:26:01,074
I knew you would never be like that.

1415
01:26:01,199 --> 01:26:04,077
That whatever happened out there,

1416
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:05,328
all that would matter,

1417
01:26:05,411 --> 01:26:08,331
really matter, was us.

1418
01:26:08,414 --> 01:26:10,208
Well, all that matters is us.

1419
01:26:10,333 --> 01:26:12,085
No.

1420
01:26:13,503 --> 01:26:14,504
Not anymore.

1421
01:26:14,629 --> 01:26:15,672
Well...

1422
01:26:17,090 --> 01:26:19,259
You have no idea what you could lose.

1423
01:26:19,342 --> 01:26:20,593
Oh, please!

1424
01:26:20,677 --> 01:26:22,762
My career

1425
01:26:22,887 --> 01:26:24,931
and the First Amendment, our country.

1426
01:26:25,014 --> 01:26:26,140
Am I missing anything?

1427
01:26:26,266 --> 01:26:27,433
Us.

1428
01:26:27,517 --> 01:26:30,019
- You're losing us.
- Oh.

1429
01:26:30,103 --> 01:26:34,691
Since prison, you don't talk or ask.

1430
01:26:34,774 --> 01:26:36,776
You just snap and bark.

1431
01:26:36,901 --> 01:26:39,863
I keep waiting for you to start
pounding the dinner table with a gavel.

1432
01:26:39,946 --> 01:26:44,033
So in addition to being
a pariah out in the world,

1433
01:26:44,117 --> 01:26:47,662
I also have the supreme joy
of battling insurrection

1434
01:26:47,787 --> 01:26:49,706
- in my own home where these...
- Battling insurrection?

1435
01:26:49,789 --> 01:26:53,459
...ten fingers literally
clothe and feed and shelter us.

1436
01:26:53,585 --> 01:26:55,795
This isn't just happening to you!

1437
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:57,714
We all hurt!

1438
01:26:57,797 --> 01:27:00,967
Niki, me, your friends!

1439
01:27:01,092 --> 01:27:03,219
Friends? What friends?

1440
01:27:03,303 --> 01:27:06,222
Who the hell has the luxury of friends?

1441
01:27:06,306 --> 01:27:08,474
I've got allies and enemies.

1442
01:27:08,558 --> 01:27:10,226
There's no room for anything else.

1443
01:27:10,310 --> 01:27:11,394
We know.

1444
01:27:12,812 --> 01:27:13,813
Good.

1445
01:27:13,938 --> 01:27:16,649
Then this discussion ends.

1446
01:27:17,942 --> 01:27:21,237
This isn't a discussion. It's a fight.

1447
01:27:22,989 --> 01:27:26,326
I will not let our children
be raised by a bully.

1448
01:27:43,468 --> 01:27:44,469
Be back.

1449
01:27:44,594 --> 01:27:45,595
All right.

1450
01:27:56,648 --> 01:28:00,985
I didn't want to fight in front
of my friends, but I'm not going home.

1451
01:28:02,195 --> 01:28:03,947
I didn't come here to fight.

1452
01:28:09,202 --> 01:28:13,456
You know, your mother is a quiet person.

1453
01:28:13,539 --> 01:28:14,540
Normally.

1454
01:28:15,375 --> 01:28:16,542
The effect of which is that

1455
01:28:16,668 --> 01:28:19,712
she can actually make me hear myself.

1456
01:28:19,796 --> 01:28:21,381
It's extraordinary.

1457
01:28:22,382 --> 01:28:26,678
Lately, it's not a sound I like much.

1458
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:31,891
Mostly because what I hear is just how...

1459
01:28:32,976 --> 01:28:36,229
How afraid I am.

1460
01:28:38,898 --> 01:28:43,069
Afraid that I'm scarring you...

1461
01:28:43,194 --> 01:28:44,737
All of you.

1462
01:28:48,741 --> 01:28:53,246
And what if it's all for nothing?
What then?

1463
01:28:56,416 --> 01:29:01,421
Well, so, I fight.

1464
01:29:03,339 --> 01:29:05,925
It's all I know how to do anymore.

1465
01:29:06,050 --> 01:29:07,760
Any... I mean, it's just...

1466
01:29:07,844 --> 01:29:11,889
Just rage at anyone who gets in my way.

1467
01:29:14,267 --> 01:29:19,689
But you have never been in my way, Nikola.

1468
01:29:19,772 --> 01:29:21,733
Not once.

1469
01:29:22,775 --> 01:29:25,403
It's crazy how mad you make me.

1470
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:30,533
Since all I ever wanted
was to be just like you.

1471
01:29:34,537 --> 01:29:38,791
Well, I'm afraid to say
that you've succeeded.

1472
01:29:43,129 --> 01:29:44,881
We know, okay?

1473
01:29:44,964 --> 01:29:47,800
It's a small town.
The gossip's always true.

1474
01:29:47,925 --> 01:29:50,720
Fire Dalton Trumbo and the rest of them

1475
01:29:50,803 --> 01:29:53,222
or you got pickets,
headlines and boycotts.

1476
01:29:53,306 --> 01:29:55,266
We will put you right out of business.

1477
01:29:55,808 --> 01:29:56,893
We?

1478
01:29:56,976 --> 01:30:01,314
The Motion Picture Alliance
for the Preservation of American Ideals.

1479
01:30:01,397 --> 01:30:03,733
Me and Ronald Reagan, Hedda Hopper,

1480
01:30:03,816 --> 01:30:06,319
guilds, studio heads, John Wayne.

1481
01:30:06,444 --> 01:30:07,570
I love John Wayne.

1482
01:30:07,695 --> 01:30:08,821
Well, I'll introduce you.

1483
01:30:08,946 --> 01:30:10,490
You guys could do a movie together.

1484
01:30:10,615 --> 01:30:12,742
Oh, gee, that would be swell.

1485
01:30:12,825 --> 01:30:15,203
Except I don't think

1486
01:30:15,328 --> 01:30:16,788
- you and me are gonna be pals.
- Hey, Frank!

1487
01:30:16,954 --> 01:30:19,082
- You wanna keep me from hiring union?
- Frank! Frank!

1488
01:30:19,165 --> 01:30:21,834
I'll go downtown, hire a bunch
of winos and hookers!

1489
01:30:22,502 --> 01:30:23,586
It doesn't matter!

1490
01:30:23,669 --> 01:30:25,463
- I make garbage!
- Frank!

1491
01:30:26,506 --> 01:30:29,133
You want to call me a pinko
in the papers? Do it!

1492
01:30:29,258 --> 01:30:32,136
- None of the people that go
to my fucking movies can read! - No, wait.

1493
01:30:34,597 --> 01:30:38,101
I am in this for the money and the pussy
and they're both falling off the trees.

1494
01:30:38,476 --> 01:30:40,019
Take it away from me.

1495
01:30:40,103 --> 01:30:41,270
Go ahead. I won't sue you,

1496
01:30:41,354 --> 01:30:45,274
but this will be the last fucking thing
you see before I beat you to death with it.

1497
01:30:45,358 --> 01:30:46,359
Tiffany!

1498
01:30:46,442 --> 01:30:47,693
Right here.

1499
01:30:59,372 --> 01:31:00,623
Fuck you want?

1500
01:31:01,499 --> 01:31:03,626
Uh... Oh, uh...

1501
01:31:03,709 --> 01:31:05,461
- New script.
- Oh, yeah?

1502
01:31:05,545 --> 01:31:09,882
Yes, it's a family picture.

1503
01:31:10,550 --> 01:31:12,218
Something I've been mulling.

1504
01:31:12,343 --> 01:31:16,139
It's the story of a young
Mexican boy and his pet bull.

1505
01:31:16,556 --> 01:31:18,558
Sounds a little fruity. What's it called?

1506
01:31:19,350 --> 01:31:22,979
The Brave One. Oh, one problem though.

1507
01:31:23,062 --> 01:31:24,230
Expensive?

1508
01:31:24,397 --> 01:31:25,565
Worse.

1509
01:31:26,566 --> 01:31:28,151
It's good.

1510
01:31:38,244 --> 01:31:41,080
Olé! Olé!

1511
01:31:45,168 --> 01:31:49,088
Who told you? What else did they say?

1512
01:31:52,592 --> 01:31:53,759
Well...

1513
01:31:54,427 --> 01:31:57,555
You too. And thank you, Frank.

1514
01:32:00,099 --> 01:32:01,350
What?

1515
01:32:03,603 --> 01:32:07,064
The Brave One has been nominated
for an Academy Award.

1516
01:32:07,273 --> 01:32:08,733
Oh.

1517
01:32:11,277 --> 01:32:14,197
- Really?
- Yes, really!

1518
01:32:16,782 --> 01:32:18,534
That's crazy.

1519
01:32:19,076 --> 01:32:20,870
I don't know. It's like Roman Holiday.

1520
01:32:20,953 --> 01:32:23,372
Oh, Hymie, this is nothing
like Roman Holiday.

1521
01:32:23,956 --> 01:32:26,959
Roman Holiday had a guy
with a name and a body

1522
01:32:27,084 --> 01:32:29,045
they could give the award to.

1523
01:32:29,128 --> 01:32:33,591
There is no Robert Rich.
Who gets the thing if it wins?

1524
01:32:34,383 --> 01:32:36,052
Well, maybe it won't.

1525
01:32:36,135 --> 01:32:38,721
I mean, it's not that good. No offense.

1526
01:32:38,804 --> 01:32:40,223
None taken.

1527
01:32:40,306 --> 01:32:42,558
And now I'd like to say
two of the most beautiful words

1528
01:32:42,642 --> 01:32:45,811
in the motion-picture industry,
Deborah Kerr.

1529
01:32:51,984 --> 01:32:55,321
The nominations for Best
Motion Picture Story are,

1530
01:32:55,404 --> 01:32:57,323
Robert Rich for The Brave One,

1531
01:32:57,448 --> 01:32:59,992
Leo Katcher for The Eddy Duchin Story,

1532
01:33:00,076 --> 01:33:02,745
Jean-Paul Sartre for
The Proud and the Beautiful,

1533
01:33:02,828 --> 01:33:05,915
and Cesare Zavattini for Umberto D.

1534
01:33:05,998 --> 01:33:07,792
The envelope please.

1535
01:33:10,670 --> 01:33:12,255
The Brave One, Robert Rich!

1536
01:33:12,338 --> 01:33:13,339
Dad!

1537
01:33:19,804 --> 01:33:21,013
- You won!
- Who's that guy?

1538
01:33:21,097 --> 01:33:24,267
Mr. Jesse Lasky Jr., Vice President
of the screenwriter's branch

1539
01:33:24,350 --> 01:33:26,686
of the Writers Guild, will accept
the award for Mr. Rich.

1540
01:33:27,186 --> 01:33:31,857
On behalf of Robert Rich and his
beautiful story, thank you very much.

1541
01:33:31,941 --> 01:33:33,317
So weird.

1542
01:33:36,696 --> 01:33:38,990
We can't find Mr. Rich anywhere.
He apparently...

1543
01:33:39,115 --> 01:33:41,200
Who the hell is Robert Rich?

1544
01:33:41,701 --> 01:33:43,035
I gotta go.

1545
01:33:43,119 --> 01:33:45,538
It had better not be who they say.

1546
01:33:45,621 --> 01:33:47,039
- Mr. Trumbo.
- Yes?

1547
01:33:47,164 --> 01:33:50,626
Are you Robert Rich?
Did you write The Brave One?

1548
01:33:52,378 --> 01:33:55,047
Well, you see, it's my policy

1549
01:33:55,131 --> 01:33:58,217
not to claim credit for any one movie.

1550
01:33:58,342 --> 01:34:01,887
That way, it's possible that I had
something to do with all of them.

1551
01:34:01,971 --> 01:34:03,973
Except the stinkers,
which were all written

1552
01:34:04,056 --> 01:34:05,641
by my enemies.

1553
01:34:05,725 --> 01:34:07,893
What's your position on the blacklist?

1554
01:34:08,394 --> 01:34:11,314
Well, on it.

1555
01:34:11,397 --> 01:34:13,566
Along with thousands of others.

1556
01:34:13,649 --> 01:34:17,653
Are you using this Robert Rich
controversy to try and end it?

1557
01:34:19,405 --> 01:34:23,492
See, The Brave One
is a nice little picture.

1558
01:34:23,576 --> 01:34:26,329
And if rumors of my involvement

1559
01:34:26,412 --> 01:34:28,581
can help sell tickets, well, then, good.

1560
01:34:28,664 --> 01:34:31,167
And if the strange circumstances

1561
01:34:31,250 --> 01:34:34,920
of its authorship raised a few questions,

1562
01:34:35,046 --> 01:34:36,422
well, even better.

1563
01:34:36,547 --> 01:34:37,715
- Trumbo?
- Yes?

1564
01:34:38,215 --> 01:34:40,217
- Phone for you.
- Well, who is it?

1565
01:34:45,765 --> 01:34:48,100
Some crazy guy, says he's Kirk Douglas.

1566
01:34:48,225 --> 01:34:51,937
Really? Huh. Well, thank you, Nikola.

1567
01:35:04,075 --> 01:35:06,869
Niki? Kirk.

1568
01:35:10,915 --> 01:35:12,291
Kirk.

1569
01:35:12,458 --> 01:35:13,793
Dalton.

1570
01:35:13,918 --> 01:35:14,960
My apologies.

1571
01:35:15,044 --> 01:35:17,713
We've had more than our
share of crank calls lately.

1572
01:35:17,797 --> 01:35:19,465
- I can imagine.
- Please have a seat.

1573
01:35:19,590 --> 01:35:20,633
May I get you a drink?

1574
01:35:20,758 --> 01:35:21,801
No. No thank you.

1575
01:35:21,884 --> 01:35:23,052
All right.

1576
01:35:26,472 --> 01:35:28,140
- So?
- I'm doing a new picture.

1577
01:35:28,933 --> 01:35:30,184
And I just got the script.

1578
01:35:31,727 --> 01:35:34,146
That must be seven hours
of entertainment there.

1579
01:35:34,230 --> 01:35:35,564
Not a single page is entertaining.

1580
01:35:36,816 --> 01:35:40,069
But there's a good story
in there somewhere.

1581
01:35:40,152 --> 01:35:44,490
About one man who tried
to take on the whole world.

1582
01:35:45,324 --> 01:35:49,829
Well, you've got me so far.

1583
01:35:49,954 --> 01:35:53,749
He was a slave who led a revolt
against the Roman Empire.

1584
01:35:53,833 --> 01:35:54,834
Hmm.

1585
01:35:56,168 --> 01:35:57,503
Now, what's the title?

1586
01:35:58,087 --> 01:35:59,922
Spartacus.

1587
01:36:00,005 --> 01:36:01,006
No, no, no.

1588
01:36:01,132 --> 01:36:04,009
I can't tell you what I'm working on now,
except to say that

1589
01:36:04,093 --> 01:36:08,514
the blacklist is alive and well
and so is the black market.

1590
01:36:09,765 --> 01:36:12,184
Well, yes, you can quote me on that.

1591
01:36:12,476 --> 01:36:17,022
Seeing my name in the papers
drives certain people out of their minds.

1592
01:36:17,106 --> 01:36:18,691
Of course. Here he is.

1593
01:36:18,816 --> 01:36:20,276
- Kirk.
- Hedda.

1594
01:36:21,193 --> 01:36:23,612
I'd like you to meet a friend
of mine, Bob Stripling.

1595
01:36:23,696 --> 01:36:26,449
House Un-American Activities Committee.

1596
01:36:26,532 --> 01:36:27,992
Mr. Douglas.

1597
01:36:29,034 --> 01:36:30,536
Mr. Stripling.

1598
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:38,544
Drink?

1599
01:36:38,669 --> 01:36:39,837
No, thank you.

1600
01:36:41,005 --> 01:36:42,465
You said it was important.

1601
01:36:43,507 --> 01:36:46,177
Only if you hired Dalton Trumbo.

1602
01:36:48,220 --> 01:36:49,555
Who I hire is my business.

1603
01:36:49,722 --> 01:36:51,056
No, Mr. Douglas.

1604
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:53,476
It's ours.

1605
01:36:54,059 --> 01:36:55,060
Why?

1606
01:36:55,186 --> 01:36:57,313
'Cause we have to keep this country safe.

1607
01:36:57,396 --> 01:36:59,064
And how are you doing that?

1608
01:36:59,148 --> 01:37:02,401
Well, why don't I show you
by putting you on the stand?

1609
01:37:03,152 --> 01:37:06,655
Hedda, is your friend trying to scare me?

1610
01:37:06,739 --> 01:37:09,742
He's just trying to show you
the way things are.

1611
01:37:09,992 --> 01:37:12,495
Maybe I don't like the way things are.

1612
01:37:13,329 --> 01:37:15,831
Kirk, we've known each other a long time.

1613
01:37:15,915 --> 01:37:18,417
Since when did you become such a bastard?

1614
01:37:19,585 --> 01:37:23,923
I was always a bastard.
You just never noticed.

1615
01:37:45,778 --> 01:37:46,779
Yes?

1616
01:37:46,862 --> 01:37:50,115
I wish to see the man who wrote this.

1617
01:37:50,199 --> 01:37:51,784
Please, come in.

1618
01:37:53,911 --> 01:37:55,079
Thank you.

1619
01:37:58,958 --> 01:38:00,960
I am Otto Preminger.

1620
01:38:03,295 --> 01:38:04,547
The director.

1621
01:38:05,923 --> 01:38:06,966
Forgive me, I...

1622
01:38:07,091 --> 01:38:10,719
I've just finished work
a few hours ago. I...

1623
01:38:10,803 --> 01:38:12,638
A copy of which I've read.

1624
01:38:12,721 --> 01:38:14,223
But how could...

1625
01:38:14,306 --> 01:38:16,600
I just had that delivered this morning.

1626
01:38:17,268 --> 01:38:20,396
I am Otto Preminger, the director.

1627
01:38:21,939 --> 01:38:23,315
Please.

1628
01:38:31,407 --> 01:38:33,576
Oh, yes, my youngest thinks

1629
01:38:33,659 --> 01:38:37,746
that I can end the suffering
of all broken birds.

1630
01:38:37,830 --> 01:38:40,457
As can I, with a broiler.

1631
01:38:43,752 --> 01:38:47,172
Are your duties completed
for Mr. Kirk Douglas?

1632
01:38:48,173 --> 01:38:52,595
No, but I do have
two weeks off for Christmas.

1633
01:38:52,678 --> 01:38:56,181
During which time you will work with me.

1634
01:38:56,307 --> 01:38:57,349
Will I?

1635
01:38:58,183 --> 01:39:01,103
If you're as intelligent as your writing.

1636
01:39:01,186 --> 01:39:03,814
And as greedy as your reputation.

1637
01:39:04,940 --> 01:39:05,941
Hmm.

1638
01:39:06,025 --> 01:39:08,277
It is an adaptation of the novel Exodus.

1639
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:09,445
You've read it?

1640
01:39:09,528 --> 01:39:10,863
No.

1641
01:39:11,030 --> 01:39:12,364
A colossal bestseller.

1642
01:39:13,282 --> 01:39:15,659
Very nearly a perfect piece of shit.

1643
01:39:16,118 --> 01:39:20,122
But there's a good story
in there somewhere.

1644
01:39:22,041 --> 01:39:24,877
I have no idea.

1645
01:39:25,002 --> 01:39:27,212
But I have Paul Newman.

1646
01:39:27,338 --> 01:39:31,133
We have spoken. He is a little reticent,

1647
01:39:31,216 --> 01:39:34,219
but I believe, at the right price,
he will accept.

1648
01:39:34,303 --> 01:39:35,971
So you're doing it?

1649
01:39:36,847 --> 01:39:40,392
Well, I think it's the only
way to get him to leave.

1650
01:39:40,517 --> 01:39:41,560
It's very important.

1651
01:39:43,228 --> 01:39:44,897
Poor Mr. Preminger.

1652
01:39:44,980 --> 01:39:47,483
He thinks he's the cat
and you're the mouse.

1653
01:40:02,915 --> 01:40:04,667
Oh, look at that. Perfect.

1654
01:40:04,750 --> 01:40:06,335
Hey, Mitzi, what's that? A Russian doll?

1655
01:40:07,544 --> 01:40:08,587
Absolutely perfect.

1656
01:40:08,671 --> 01:40:10,756
Oh! What is this, Santa?

1657
01:40:10,839 --> 01:40:13,759
Just a little something for Mrs. Claus.

1658
01:40:13,884 --> 01:40:15,094
I'll open it later.

1659
01:40:15,177 --> 01:40:16,261
Christmas is over.

1660
01:40:19,014 --> 01:40:20,182
Well...

1661
01:40:21,725 --> 01:40:23,268
Did you read the new scenes?

1662
01:40:23,352 --> 01:40:26,522
Dreadful. Keep up this level of work,

1663
01:40:26,605 --> 01:40:29,608
and I will see to it
your name is on my movie.

1664
01:40:30,442 --> 01:40:31,944
To take the blame.

1665
01:40:40,077 --> 01:40:42,705
Well, there you go.

1666
01:40:47,710 --> 01:40:51,130
Ooh! Hello. Hi, Sammy.

1667
01:40:51,296 --> 01:40:55,050
Oh, do you know that
Kirk Douglas gave me this bird?

1668
01:40:55,134 --> 01:40:57,136
It's a distraction.

1669
01:40:57,261 --> 01:40:59,221
No. No, not at all.

1670
01:40:59,304 --> 01:41:02,558
I named him Sam Jackson.

1671
01:41:02,641 --> 01:41:03,976
He wrote Spartacus.

1672
01:41:07,062 --> 01:41:08,313
Well?

1673
01:41:10,149 --> 01:41:11,817
- Better.
- Thank God.

1674
01:41:11,900 --> 01:41:15,404
But it simply lacks genius.

1675
01:41:16,488 --> 01:41:20,576
Otto, if every scene is brilliant,

1676
01:41:20,659 --> 01:41:23,829
your movie is going to be
utterly monotonous.

1677
01:41:24,329 --> 01:41:26,498
I'll tell you what.

1678
01:41:26,623 --> 01:41:30,669
You write every scene brilliantly,

1679
01:41:30,753 --> 01:41:33,505
and I will direct unevenly.

1680
01:41:36,508 --> 01:41:37,509
What is it, dear?

1681
01:41:40,345 --> 01:41:41,764
Thank you.

1682
01:41:41,847 --> 01:41:43,348
Oh, hello, Kirk.

1683
01:41:44,183 --> 01:41:46,268
Merry Christmas. Thank you, Mitzi.

1684
01:41:46,351 --> 01:41:48,604
Otto. How are you?

1685
01:41:49,146 --> 01:41:51,148
I am very well, Kirk.

1686
01:41:52,149 --> 01:41:53,984
I, uh, didn't mean to interrupt.

1687
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:58,447
No, no. No, not at all. Not at all.

1688
01:41:58,530 --> 01:42:00,866
Otto, would you mind
if we had a little chat?

1689
01:42:00,991 --> 01:42:01,992
Won't be a second.

1690
01:42:07,539 --> 01:42:09,374
I sort of feel like
I walked in on my wife.

1691
01:42:10,709 --> 01:42:11,794
Do you love him?

1692
01:42:11,877 --> 01:42:13,879
Oh, it's far more lurid than that.

1693
01:42:14,046 --> 01:42:16,173
He's paying me for my services.

1694
01:42:17,007 --> 01:42:18,050
So am I.

1695
01:42:18,133 --> 01:42:21,553
And you'll get them again,
January 2nd, as promised.

1696
01:42:21,637 --> 01:42:24,389
I just need you a few days
on some of the new scenes.

1697
01:42:24,473 --> 01:42:27,309
Of course, but not until the 2nd.

1698
01:42:28,227 --> 01:42:31,146
I wouldn't ask, but I've
never had a director

1699
01:42:31,230 --> 01:42:35,150
who's a bigger pain in my ass
than Stanley Kubrick.

1700
01:42:35,234 --> 01:42:37,736
The worst part is, he's right.

1701
01:42:39,738 --> 01:42:42,658
Well, I wouldn't refuse, but...

1702
01:42:45,410 --> 01:42:49,581
Well, I really...
This should remain between us.

1703
01:42:49,706 --> 01:42:51,166
Of course.

1704
01:42:51,291 --> 01:42:52,751
Well...

1705
01:42:53,585 --> 01:42:55,546
Preminger has declared that...

1706
01:42:56,588 --> 01:42:58,590
Well, what he said was,

1707
01:42:58,715 --> 01:43:01,176
"You keep up this level of work,

1708
01:43:01,260 --> 01:43:05,180
"and I'll see to it that
your name is on my movie."

1709
01:43:05,764 --> 01:43:07,683
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

1710
01:43:07,766 --> 01:43:10,519
Those were his exact words.

1711
01:43:15,774 --> 01:43:17,234
Be in touch.

1712
01:43:17,359 --> 01:43:18,777
Very well.

1713
01:43:18,861 --> 01:43:20,070
Merry Christmas!

1714
01:43:20,195 --> 01:43:21,405
You too.

1715
01:43:25,284 --> 01:43:27,953
I suppose he wants you back.

1716
01:43:28,036 --> 01:43:30,622
Well, no. No, no. He...

1717
01:43:30,706 --> 01:43:35,502
He just stopped by
to talk about a screen credit.

1718
01:43:38,171 --> 01:43:39,965
On Spartacus?

1719
01:43:42,342 --> 01:43:46,221
Well, I really shouldn't
have said anything.

1720
01:43:46,305 --> 01:43:47,639
You understand.

1721
01:43:49,349 --> 01:43:52,519
Five minutes! Back in
five minutes, everybody!

1722
01:43:54,438 --> 01:43:55,647
Kirk,

1723
01:43:56,607 --> 01:43:59,401
Hedda Hopper just told me the American
Legion is going to boycott us

1724
01:43:59,484 --> 01:44:00,527
unless you get rid of Trumbo.

1725
01:44:00,611 --> 01:44:02,905
Ed, he's not done with the script.

1726
01:44:02,988 --> 01:44:04,364
His name will never be on the thing.

1727
01:44:04,448 --> 01:44:05,908
What's anybody boycotting?

1728
01:44:05,991 --> 01:44:08,493
Kirk... Just a second. Please. Please.

1729
01:44:08,577 --> 01:44:10,078
Just give me five seconds, please.

1730
01:44:10,162 --> 01:44:14,082
Listen. Twenty million Americans
are saying loud and clear,

1731
01:44:14,166 --> 01:44:18,462
they will never buy a ticket to our movie
unless you fire one writer.

1732
01:44:19,087 --> 01:44:22,424
Here's 50! Pick one.

1733
01:44:43,362 --> 01:44:45,072
Mind if I stick my nose in?

1734
01:44:45,155 --> 01:44:46,281
Please.

1735
01:44:47,366 --> 01:44:51,995
He knows. He sees Kirk Douglas
coming in and out of here.

1736
01:44:52,079 --> 01:44:54,498
And Otto Preminger and his Rolls.

1737
01:44:56,458 --> 01:44:59,670
He's an idiot. But he's not stupid.

1738
01:45:00,045 --> 01:45:02,172
Has he called the FBI?

1739
01:45:02,255 --> 01:45:04,549
Congress?

1740
01:45:04,633 --> 01:45:07,052
No, because everything they can do,

1741
01:45:07,135 --> 01:45:09,096
they've already done.

1742
01:45:09,179 --> 01:45:11,515
That Oscar belongs to you.

1743
01:45:13,308 --> 01:45:14,351
Get it!

1744
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:20,899
My God! You're nothing like me.

1745
01:45:20,983 --> 01:45:22,317
You're worse.

1746
01:45:29,116 --> 01:45:31,702
For the record, you're Robert Rich?

1747
01:45:31,785 --> 01:45:32,786
I am.

1748
01:45:32,869 --> 01:45:34,329
I've been through the whole list, Ed.

1749
01:45:34,413 --> 01:45:35,622
They're all hacks.

1750
01:45:35,706 --> 01:45:37,624
And you wrote The Brave One?

1751
01:45:37,708 --> 01:45:38,917
I did.

1752
01:45:40,043 --> 01:45:41,044
Ed, let me call you back.

1753
01:45:41,128 --> 01:45:43,672
Why come forward now?

1754
01:45:43,755 --> 01:45:46,466
Well, as someone who has been
thoroughly investigated

1755
01:45:46,550 --> 01:45:48,719
by the House Un-American
Activities Committee,

1756
01:45:48,802 --> 01:45:53,056
I started wondering,
why hasn't anyone taken

1757
01:45:53,140 --> 01:45:56,101
a good long look at them

1758
01:45:56,184 --> 01:45:58,603
and their work in the movie industry?

1759
01:45:58,687 --> 01:46:03,108
You see, they were convened
to uncover enemy agents,

1760
01:46:04,151 --> 01:46:08,697
expose communist conspiracies
and write anti-sedition laws.

1761
01:46:08,780 --> 01:46:12,909
Well, here we are, thousands of hours

1762
01:46:12,993 --> 01:46:15,746
and millions of dollars later.

1763
01:46:15,829 --> 01:46:19,291
Agents uncovered, zero.

1764
01:46:19,374 --> 01:46:23,920
Conspiracies exposed, zero.
Laws written, zero.

1765
01:46:24,588 --> 01:46:29,593
You see, all they do is deny
people their right to work.

1766
01:46:30,218 --> 01:46:32,095
And they can't even get that right.

1767
01:46:32,596 --> 01:46:34,639
Academy Awards, two.

1768
01:46:39,144 --> 01:46:40,437
And how does that feel?

1769
01:46:40,520 --> 01:46:43,523
To have so undermined the blacklist
that it's almost a joke.

1770
01:46:43,607 --> 01:46:45,192
A joke?

1771
01:46:49,112 --> 01:46:54,618
I know the blacklist
that produced Robert Rich.

1772
01:46:54,701 --> 01:46:59,539
I've seen its horror and cruelty.

1773
01:46:59,873 --> 01:47:02,000
A hideous waste of life

1774
01:47:02,084 --> 01:47:06,713
as I've walked in the
long line of its anonymous.

1775
01:47:07,756 --> 01:47:14,304
And I cannot invent one more
witticism about Robert Rich

1776
01:47:14,387 --> 01:47:17,557
or the Oscar he can't claim.

1777
01:47:19,643 --> 01:47:24,356
Because that small,

1778
01:47:24,981 --> 01:47:28,193
worthless golden statue

1779
01:47:28,944 --> 01:47:32,072
is covered with the blood of my friends.

1780
01:47:38,954 --> 01:47:40,122
I'll get it.

1781
01:47:42,457 --> 01:47:45,335
Hello? Oh, hello, Otto.

1782
01:47:45,418 --> 01:47:47,587
I've read your last draft.

1783
01:47:47,671 --> 01:47:48,880
What do you think?

1784
01:47:48,964 --> 01:47:54,094
My answer is on the front page
of today's New York Times.

1785
01:48:01,434 --> 01:48:03,436
You hated it that much?

1786
01:48:03,979 --> 01:48:06,857
Merry Christmas, Mr. Trumbo.

1787
01:48:12,612 --> 01:48:14,823
Ed, have a seat.

1788
01:48:35,594 --> 01:48:38,430
- Well, why doesn't he kill him?
- Kill him.

1789
01:48:38,513 --> 01:48:39,723
Kill him!

1790
01:48:39,806 --> 01:48:41,183
- Kill him, you imbecile!
- Kill him!

1791
01:48:41,266 --> 01:48:42,267
Kill him!

1792
01:48:46,855 --> 01:48:49,191
Great. Great.

1793
01:48:49,274 --> 01:48:51,610
Marty, have them put up the scene
with Varinia and Crassus.

1794
01:48:51,693 --> 01:48:52,777
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

1795
01:48:52,861 --> 01:48:54,779
- Listen, Kirk, I...
- One second.

1796
01:49:01,494 --> 01:49:05,665
Warren, I'd like you to
put out a press release.

1797
01:49:05,749 --> 01:49:08,376
The screen... One second, Warren.

1798
01:49:08,460 --> 01:49:11,755
What do you remember when
you think about Spartacus?

1799
01:49:15,300 --> 01:49:18,136
He was a man who began all alone

1800
01:49:18,220 --> 01:49:19,387
like an animal.

1801
01:49:20,180 --> 01:49:23,183
Yet on the day he died,
thousands and thousands

1802
01:49:23,266 --> 01:49:25,060
would gladly have died in his place.

1803
01:49:26,686 --> 01:49:29,356
What was he? Was he a god?

1804
01:49:30,815 --> 01:49:33,526
He wasn't a god.

1805
01:49:33,610 --> 01:49:37,280
He was simple man. A slave.

1806
01:49:41,243 --> 01:49:42,410
I loved him.

1807
01:49:43,370 --> 01:49:48,291
Warren, the press release will say,

1808
01:49:48,375 --> 01:49:51,753
"The screenplay for Spartacus
was written by Dalton Trumbo."

1809
01:49:51,836 --> 01:49:52,837
Thank you.

1810
01:49:54,506 --> 01:49:57,676
Kirk, if you don't get rid
of Trumbo, I will.

1811
01:49:57,759 --> 01:50:01,388
And right after I quit,
you can reshoot all my scenes.

1812
01:50:01,471 --> 01:50:06,476
You see, Ed, for better or worse,

1813
01:50:06,559 --> 01:50:08,603
I am Spartacus.

1814
01:50:12,857 --> 01:50:16,945
There's a picture coming out.
It's called Spartacus.

1815
01:50:17,028 --> 01:50:18,780
It's starring Kirk Douglas,

1816
01:50:18,863 --> 01:50:21,783
and it is written by Dalton Trumbo.

1817
01:50:23,618 --> 01:50:26,121
If there is some
other writer's name on it,

1818
01:50:26,204 --> 01:50:27,872
don't believe it.

1819
01:50:27,956 --> 01:50:29,624
We're on to them.

1820
01:50:36,339 --> 01:50:38,425
- Yes?
- Now, listen, Ed.

1821
01:50:38,508 --> 01:50:43,054
We'll picket every theater that movie
is in unless you pull the prints tonight.

1822
01:50:43,138 --> 01:50:45,223
And you get that traitor's name off it.

1823
01:50:45,307 --> 01:50:47,142
Hedda, you can't put me in this position.

1824
01:50:47,225 --> 01:50:48,393
That's expensive and pointless.

1825
01:50:48,476 --> 01:50:52,564
Then you can kiss your movie,
your studio and your miserable ass goodbye.

1826
01:50:52,647 --> 01:50:57,110
Hollywood turns out in force to
hail Ul's new film spectacle, Spartacus,

1827
01:50:57,193 --> 01:50:59,321
on the premier of the $12-million picture,

1828
01:50:59,404 --> 01:51:00,572
in the film colony.

1829
01:51:00,655 --> 01:51:04,826
The protesters also showed up to remind
everyone of the political controversy

1830
01:51:04,909 --> 01:51:07,120
surrounding the making of this film.

1831
01:52:00,131 --> 01:52:01,299
Cleo?

1832
01:52:05,095 --> 01:52:06,888
What is it? What's wrong?

1833
01:52:07,013 --> 01:52:08,807
Oh...

1834
01:52:15,480 --> 01:52:19,150
It's over, isn't it?

1835
01:52:21,945 --> 01:52:23,488
Yes. Yes.

1836
01:52:27,575 --> 01:52:29,244
And we made it.

1837
01:52:33,873 --> 01:52:35,083
Yes.

1838
01:52:39,629 --> 01:52:42,257
President Kennedy
enjoyed a rare evening off

1839
01:52:42,340 --> 01:52:46,261
attending the new
Kirk Douglas film, Spartacus.

1840
01:52:46,344 --> 01:52:49,931
We are here live, awaiting
the president's comments.

1841
01:52:51,141 --> 01:52:53,893
Mr. President,
Mr. President, Mr. President!

1842
01:52:53,977 --> 01:52:55,728
It's a very controversial film.

1843
01:52:55,812 --> 01:52:57,355
What did you think?

1844
01:52:57,439 --> 01:53:00,191
Oh, I think it's a fine picture,

1845
01:53:00,275 --> 01:53:02,569
and I think it's going to be a big hit.

1846
01:53:02,652 --> 01:53:06,698
The implication of Kennedy's
approval of this film are wide ranging.

1847
01:53:06,781 --> 01:53:09,742
The novel was written
by a former communist.

1848
01:53:10,285 --> 01:53:13,079
The screenplay was adapted
by a former communist.

1849
01:53:13,329 --> 01:53:16,332
And this signifies the
blacklist may be over,

1850
01:53:16,416 --> 01:53:19,210
as Kirk Douglas and Otto Preminger

1851
01:53:19,294 --> 01:53:22,839
have openly hired and credited
blacklisted writers.

1852
01:53:23,298 --> 01:53:28,553
This is a clear repudiation of
a decade-long fight by anti-communists...

1853
01:53:32,140 --> 01:53:33,766
This next award is for the member

1854
01:53:33,850 --> 01:53:36,561
who has advanced the
literature of motion pictures.

1855
01:53:36,644 --> 01:53:39,522
Occasionally, there appears
among us a person

1856
01:53:39,731 --> 01:53:42,400
whose virtues are so manifest,

1857
01:53:42,484 --> 01:53:45,987
who so subordinates his own ego
to the concerns of others,

1858
01:53:46,070 --> 01:53:50,325
who lives in such harmony
with all the standards of the community,

1859
01:53:50,408 --> 01:53:53,411
that he is revered and loved by everyone.

1860
01:53:53,495 --> 01:53:56,247
Such a man, Dalton Trumbo is not.

1861
01:53:59,334 --> 01:54:03,880
It gives me great pleasure to present
the Writers Guild of America Laurel Award

1862
01:54:03,963 --> 01:54:05,715
to Dalton Trumbo.

1863
01:54:12,680 --> 01:54:13,723
Congratulations.

1864
01:54:13,806 --> 01:54:15,600
Thank you, thank you very much.

1865
01:54:22,065 --> 01:54:25,068
Thank you, thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

1866
01:54:26,528 --> 01:54:33,076
Often, when I stand before
the film community,

1867
01:54:33,159 --> 01:54:35,954
there's an elephant in the room.

1868
01:54:36,037 --> 01:54:37,539
Me.

1869
01:54:37,622 --> 01:54:41,793
And I thought I would address that.

1870
01:54:45,004 --> 01:54:50,343
The blacklist was a time of evil.

1871
01:54:50,426 --> 01:54:54,222
And no one who survived it

1872
01:54:54,305 --> 01:54:57,684
came through untouched by evil.

1873
01:54:59,686 --> 01:55:02,981
Caught in a situation that had passed

1874
01:55:03,064 --> 01:55:06,526
beyond the control of mere individuals.

1875
01:55:07,402 --> 01:55:10,863
Each person reacted as his nature,

1876
01:55:10,947 --> 01:55:13,825
his needs, his convictions,

1877
01:55:13,908 --> 01:55:16,119
and his particular circumstances

1878
01:55:16,202 --> 01:55:18,121
compelled him to.

1879
01:55:18,204 --> 01:55:20,707
It was a time of fear.

1880
01:55:22,166 --> 01:55:25,503
And no one was exempt.

1881
01:55:25,587 --> 01:55:31,259
Scores of people lost their homes.

1882
01:55:31,884 --> 01:55:34,846
Their families disintegrated. They lost!

1883
01:55:40,435 --> 01:55:42,145
And in some...

1884
01:55:46,691 --> 01:55:49,569
Some even lost their lives.

1885
01:55:53,656 --> 01:55:59,287
But when you look back
upon that dark time,

1886
01:55:59,370 --> 01:56:02,165
as I think you should every now and then,

1887
01:56:03,333 --> 01:56:05,001
it will do you no good

1888
01:56:05,084 --> 01:56:10,715
to search for heroes or villains.

1889
01:56:10,798 --> 01:56:12,508
There weren't any.

1890
01:56:13,635 --> 01:56:15,720
There were only victims.

1891
01:56:17,972 --> 01:56:21,351
Victims, because each of us

1892
01:56:21,434 --> 01:56:24,687
felt compelled to say or do things

1893
01:56:24,771 --> 01:56:26,189
that we otherwise would not.

1894
01:56:27,982 --> 01:56:31,903
To deliver or receive wounds

1895
01:56:31,986 --> 01:56:36,074
which we truly did not wish to exchange.

1896
01:56:38,368 --> 01:56:41,954
I look out to my family sitting there,

1897
01:56:42,038 --> 01:56:46,918
and I realize what I've put them through.

1898
01:56:48,836 --> 01:56:50,630
And it's unfair.

1899
01:56:54,801 --> 01:57:01,641
My wife, who somehow kept it all together,

1900
01:57:02,266 --> 01:57:04,227
amazes me.

1901
01:57:05,770 --> 01:57:10,441
And so what I say here tonight

1902
01:57:10,525 --> 01:57:13,069
is not intended

1903
01:57:13,152 --> 01:57:18,157
to be hurtful to anyone.

1904
01:57:20,159 --> 01:57:24,330
It is intended to heal the hurt.

1905
01:57:26,541 --> 01:57:30,670
To repair the wounds which,

1906
01:57:30,753 --> 01:57:33,297
for years,

1907
01:57:33,381 --> 01:57:37,927
have been inflicted upon each other.

1908
01:57:38,970 --> 01:57:43,057
And most egregiously, upon ourselves.

1909
01:57:48,855 --> 01:57:51,649
Thank you. Thank you kindly.

1910
02:00:41,152 --> 02:00:43,613
If you receive the Oscar,

1911
02:00:43,696 --> 02:00:45,865
what do you intend to do with it?

1912
02:00:45,948 --> 02:00:50,953
I have... I have a daughter, 13 years old.

1913
02:00:52,622 --> 02:00:56,542
I've been blacklisted since she was three.

1914
02:00:56,626 --> 02:00:58,502
She's known the title

1915
02:00:58,586 --> 02:01:02,214
of every motion picture
I've written in this study.

1916
02:01:02,298 --> 02:01:05,843
And she's kept that title secret till now.

1917
02:01:05,927 --> 02:01:08,137
A soldier.

1918
02:01:08,220 --> 02:01:11,182
When her friends say to her,
as children do,

1919
02:01:11,265 --> 02:01:14,602
"My father does so-and-so.
What does your father do?"

1920
02:01:14,685 --> 02:01:19,023
This has confronted her
with a very real problem.

1921
02:01:19,106 --> 02:01:22,777
It confronts her with the problem,
and has since she was three,

1922
02:01:22,860 --> 02:01:25,988
of who her father really is.

1923
02:01:26,072 --> 02:01:29,033
And what her father really does.

1924
02:01:30,701 --> 02:01:34,163
I, uh, think

1925
02:01:34,246 --> 02:01:38,334
I will give this Oscar,
if I get it, to that girl.

1926
02:01:39,752 --> 02:01:42,296
I think I will tell her,

1927
02:01:42,380 --> 02:01:45,007
"Well, here is one secret

1928
02:01:45,091 --> 02:01:48,386
"you no longer need to be burdened with."

1929
02:01:49,303 --> 02:01:54,141
I'll tell her we have
our names back again.
