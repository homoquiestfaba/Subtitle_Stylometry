00:23:09,358 --> 00:23:12,025
He wants a mouthpiece.

352
00:23:12,108 --> 00:23:13,858
You might wanna stay.

353
00:23:15,817 --> 00:23:17,400
Nice boots.

354
00:23:18,817 --> 00:23:20,358
[Deke munching]

355
00:23:27,692 --> 00:23:28,858
[door thuds]

356
00:23:33,525 --> 00:23:35,942
Hi, Stan. Jim.

357
00:23:39,275 --> 00:23:42,025
- Where's my lawyer?
- In the building.

358
00:23:42,108 --> 00:23:43,608
Takes a while.

359
00:24:09,525 --> 00:24:11,275
A girl from
your neighborhood...

360
00:24:12,025 --> 00:24:13,733
dead.

361
00:24:13,817 --> 00:24:15,192
And you,
a known sex offender...

362
00:24:15,275 --> 00:24:18,150
I was taking a piss
and I was in the alley.

363
00:24:18,233 --> 00:24:19,608
You had your dick out.

364
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:21,483
- [Stan] This girl...
- [Jim] Teenage girl, Stan.

365
00:24:21,567 --> 00:24:23,858
[Stan] She was just walking by.

366
00:24:23,942 --> 00:24:25,317
You gotta believe me.

367
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,525
I want to.

368
00:24:26,608 --> 00:24:28,650
I got nothing to do with this.

369
00:24:38,733 --> 00:24:39,858
[Jim] Yeah.

370
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:48,817
What can you tell me
about Mary Roberts?

371
00:24:51,483 --> 00:24:53,108
What? [sobs]

372
00:24:53,192 --> 00:24:56,108
Mary Roberts.

373
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:12,067
[uneasy music playing]

374
00:25:27,858 --> 00:25:29,150
[Stan shuddering]

375
00:25:30,775 --> 00:25:32,733
[Jim] <i>Mary Roberts,
Stan Peters?</i>

376
00:25:32,817 --> 00:25:35,275
Dead girl, suspect.

377
00:25:35,358 --> 00:25:36,775
Was he your boy?

378
00:25:36,858 --> 00:25:39,650
You never know.
Just saying hello to an old pal.

379
00:25:39,733 --> 00:25:41,942
Well, your old pal says
you broke his jaw once.

380
00:25:42,025 --> 00:25:44,733
You gotta kiss a lot of frogs
to find your prince.

381
00:25:44,817 --> 00:25:46,150
[Carl] What are you
still doing here?

382
00:25:46,233 --> 00:25:47,608
[Deke] Just leaving.

383
00:25:52,275 --> 00:25:54,983
Order up the poor boy
on a Mary Roberts.

384
00:25:55,067 --> 00:25:56,775
I'm going for a sandwich.
You want one?

385
00:25:56,858 --> 00:25:57,858
Nah, I'm good.

386
00:25:57,942 --> 00:25:59,233
The Rathbuns are waiting.

387
00:25:59,983 --> 00:26:01,233
[Jim] Missing person.

388
00:26:01,317 --> 00:26:02,775
Yeah, they think
their daughter Ronda's a stat.

389
00:26:02,858 --> 00:26:04,358
We got a corpse?

390
00:26:04,442 --> 00:26:06,733
Then it's still
Missing Persons.

391
00:26:22,525 --> 00:26:24,317
[girl 1] So crazy, girl.
You're gonna fly out of here.

392
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,192
- [girl 2 squeals]
- [laughter]

393
00:26:29,733 --> 00:26:31,817
[soft music playing]

394
00:26:35,858 --> 00:26:37,358
[mouthing]

395
00:27:09,317 --> 00:27:11,942
[Deke] Don't you ever get tired
of looking at dead bodies?

396
00:27:12,025 --> 00:27:13,067
[Flo chuckles]

397
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:15,442
I could ask you the same.

398
00:27:15,525 --> 00:27:17,442
[romantic music playing
on radio]

399
00:27:19,025 --> 00:27:20,650
What's this all about, Joe?

400
00:27:20,733 --> 00:27:22,983
[grunts] Similar case up north.

401
00:27:24,983 --> 00:27:27,442
- Thanks for doing this for me, Flo.
- No problem.

402
00:27:27,525 --> 00:27:29,692
She won't see the knife
till tomorrow.

403
00:27:29,775 --> 00:27:32,900
Well, she won't see
another knife.

404
00:27:36,442 --> 00:27:40,483
General proximity, similar pattern
and depth to our other four.

405
00:27:40,567 --> 00:27:43,983
The garbage bag was an adornment
placed on her head postmortem.

406
00:27:44,067 --> 00:27:45,817
Maybe when the guy came back.

407
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,317
Came back?

408
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,525
Unless he was a babysitter,
he made a return trip,

409
00:27:50,608 --> 00:27:53,900
moved the girl and propped her
up against the door.

410
00:27:53,983 --> 00:27:55,567
Now, turn that up for me.

411
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,108
[chuckles] Okay.

412
00:27:58,275 --> 00:27:59,567
[increases volume]

413
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:05,400
Mm... KHRT. Love songs
of the '50s and '60s. Mm.

414
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:07,275
You get a dental on the bites?

415
00:28:07,817 --> 00:28:09,525
Right. Uh...

416
00:28:09,608 --> 00:28:12,358
Yeah, we did a rush on it.
Inconclusive.

417
00:28:12,442 --> 00:28:14,817
It could be the same as we
found on the Holland girl.

418
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,483
More sucking, less biting.

419
00:28:18,608 --> 00:28:20,025
Any saliva samples?

420
00:28:20,108 --> 00:28:21,608
Funny you should ask.

421
00:28:21,692 --> 00:28:23,650
I found traces of sodium
benzoate in the bites.

422
00:28:23,733 --> 00:28:26,358
- What's that?
- Used in mouthwash. Toothpaste.

423
00:28:26,442 --> 00:28:27,650
And check this out.

424
00:28:27,733 --> 00:28:30,108
He gave her a postmortem shave.

425
00:28:32,067 --> 00:28:33,858
Nicked her, no blood.

426
00:28:33,942 --> 00:28:35,108
What about her D-tract?

427
00:28:35,192 --> 00:28:37,275
She had one good meal
before she died.

428
00:28:37,358 --> 00:28:39,650
Speaking of which, you hungry?

429
00:28:39,733 --> 00:28:42,233
I'll buy if you pull up
an old file for me.

430
00:28:42,317 --> 00:28:43,608
Yeah.

431
00:28:48,525 --> 00:28:50,692
Case up north, my ass.

432
00:28:50,775 --> 00:28:52,442
The fuck is going on, Joe?

433
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,108
I'll pull your file.

434
00:28:57,192 --> 00:29:00,525
But if something goes wrong,
I can't be there for you again, okay?

435
00:29:00,608 --> 00:29:01,942
Okay.

436
00:29:14,317 --> 00:29:15,650
[volume decreases]

437
00:29:20,942 --> 00:29:22,650
You knew him, didn't you?

438
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:27,067
At least, he knew you. [scoffs]

439
00:29:28,608 --> 00:29:31,108
That's why he did that
to your face.

440
00:29:33,442 --> 00:29:34,900
You let him in.

441
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,525
You thought...

442
00:29:38,858 --> 00:29:39,900
"Eh...

443
00:29:41,817 --> 00:29:43,775
Not my type," but...

444
00:29:45,192 --> 00:29:47,650
maybe he could be
a friend. I mean,

445
00:29:47,733 --> 00:29:49,858
you can't get enough of them.

446
00:29:56,317 --> 00:29:59,150
But then you had
that one little feeling.

447
00:29:59,233 --> 00:30:01,067
You thought, "What if?"

448
00:30:03,483 --> 00:30:05,692
But you waved it away.

449
00:30:08,025 --> 00:30:10,025
Thought, "Ah, what the hell?

450
00:30:13,025 --> 00:30:14,775
Life's too short."

451
00:30:17,192 --> 00:30:18,983
And you were right.

452
00:30:20,775 --> 00:30:22,692
Life is too short, Julie.

453
00:30:22,775 --> 00:30:25,483
And you should've listened.

454
00:30:25,567 --> 00:30:28,400
You should've listened to
that one little feeling, but...

455
00:30:33,608 --> 00:30:35,900
Just like I'm listening
to you now.

456
00:30:35,983 --> 00:30:38,525
You can talk to me.

457
00:30:38,608 --> 00:30:40,817
I'm all the friend you got.

458
00:30:46,233 --> 00:30:48,442
[Flo] You know my take
on the world, Joe?

459
00:30:49,358 --> 00:30:52,358
There's good and there's bad,

460
00:30:52,442 --> 00:30:53,650
but you gotta fight.

461
00:30:53,733 --> 00:30:55,983
[music playing faintly
on speaker]

462
00:30:57,233 --> 00:30:58,692
Because, brother...

463
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,483
when I look in your eyes,

464
00:31:03,192 --> 00:31:04,775
what I see...

465
00:31:06,983 --> 00:31:08,108
it ain't good.

466
00:31:15,608 --> 00:31:17,900
To remind me of what I did.

467
00:31:19,067 --> 00:31:21,775
For what we did.

468
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,275
[door creaking]

469
00:31:45,817 --> 00:31:47,567
[muffled chattering]

470
00:32:00,817 --> 00:32:02,942
[woman] I thought
you guys were finished.

471
00:32:03,025 --> 00:32:06,067
How long has this, uh,
fridge been broken?

472
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,275
I don't know. A week, maybe.

473
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:08,608
You're responsible for repairs?

474
00:32:08,692 --> 00:32:10,692
Oh, are you thinking
about moving in?

475
00:32:10,775 --> 00:32:13,483
[laughing]

476
00:32:13,567 --> 00:32:15,567
No, ma'am.

477
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:20,400
I called a guy to come fix it, but, uh,
then, you know, the girl got killed.

478
00:32:20,483 --> 00:32:22,483
So, suddenly,
it didn't seem so important.

479
00:32:22,567 --> 00:32:25,650
And, I mean, look. I gotta paint the
walls and get rid of the mattress.

480
00:32:25,733 --> 00:32:28,233
- Who'd you call?
- [sighs]

481
00:32:28,317 --> 00:32:30,108
Uh, a place
around the corner.

482
00:32:30,192 --> 00:32:33,400
AB... ABC Appliance.
Something like that. ABC Appliance.

483
00:32:33,483 --> 00:32:35,150
And the stuff in the fridge
was already rotten?

484
00:32:35,233 --> 00:32:37,192
- Yeah, yeah.
- Mm-hmm. Except the milk?

485
00:32:37,275 --> 00:32:39,775
- My kid drank it, so cuff me.
- Oh.

486
00:32:39,858 --> 00:32:41,983
- Anything else?
- In the fridge?

487
00:32:42,067 --> 00:32:43,400
There were a few beers. Why?

488
00:32:43,483 --> 00:32:44,567
I'm gonna need it for evidence.

489
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:47,317
For evidence.
Yeah, okay.

490
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,233
- Coming right up.
- All righty.

491
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:00,983
[grunts]

492
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:06,192
[sighs]

493
00:33:08,942 --> 00:33:11,108
[somber music playing]

494
00:33:32,358 --> 00:33:33,608
[door opens]

495
00:33:33,692 --> 00:33:36,067
[landlady] How do you
ever get used to it?

496
00:33:38,942 --> 00:33:40,108
What's that, ma'am?

497
00:33:40,192 --> 00:33:41,567
The smell.

498
00:33:43,108 --> 00:33:48,150
You know, if you're lucky,
you don't get used to it.

499
00:33:48,233 --> 00:33:51,025
[landlady sighs] Here.

500
00:33:51,108 --> 00:33:54,108
Close up when
you're done, okay?

501
00:33:58,025 --> 00:33:59,275
[door closes]

502
00:34:06,233 --> 00:34:07,650
[indistinct chatter]

503
00:34:09,025 --> 00:34:10,400
I don't want any trouble.

504
00:34:10,483 --> 00:34:12,317
I have no connection
to the girls out front.

505
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,858
- Just need a room.
- Oh.

506
00:34:14,942 --> 00:34:16,358
$20 a night, $100 a week.

507
00:34:16,442 --> 00:34:18,567
There are some things in there
from the last guy.

508
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:19,817
Just toss 'em in the hallway.

509
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,275
And don't worry,
the sheets are clean.

510
00:34:23,692 --> 00:34:24,817
Hey!

511
00:34:25,567 --> 00:34:26,900
Do you want some company?

512
00:34:42,775 --> 00:34:43,942
[keys clinking]

513
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,067
[sighs heavily]

514
00:34:50,858 --> 00:34:52,483
[sirens wailing in distance]

515
00:35:20,733 --> 00:35:23,108
- [Jim] <i>Good night. I love you.</i>
- [Chloe] <i>Love you.</i>

516
00:35:23,192 --> 00:35:25,192
- I love you.
- Love you.

517
00:35:27,942 --> 00:35:29,858
- Did you say your prayers?
- Yep.

518
00:35:29,942 --> 00:35:31,317
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- [Chloe] Night.

519
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,358
[Jennifer] Good night.

520
00:35:32,442 --> 00:35:34,067
- [Ana] Hey.
- [Jim] Mm?

521
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,900
Did you set the alarm?

522
00:35:39,817 --> 00:35:41,025
Yeah.

523
00:35:48,275 --> 00:35:50,275
[soft music playing]

524
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:35,983
[whispers] It's never over.

525
00:37:05,483 --> 00:37:08,525
Re-interview the immigrants
in the Brock apartment.

526
00:37:08,608 --> 00:37:09,858
Jimmy.

527
00:37:10,692 --> 00:37:11,817

00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:08,733
Better than me.

703
00:48:08,817 --> 00:48:11,983
Well, you never really had time
for that kind of thing.

704
00:48:14,858 --> 00:48:16,442
How are the girls?

705
00:48:16,525 --> 00:48:18,483
- Good.
- Good.

706
00:48:18,567 --> 00:48:20,442
You ought to give 'em a call.

707
00:48:20,525 --> 00:48:22,567
Yeah. Yeah.

708
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:24,150
Yeah.

709
00:48:24,233 --> 00:48:26,025
Yeah, I should.

710
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:32,692
You all right?

711
00:48:34,692 --> 00:48:36,400
You know me.

712
00:48:37,483 --> 00:48:39,317
Yeah.

713
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:40,942
I know you.

714
00:48:44,525 --> 00:48:45,817
Well...

715
00:48:46,525 --> 00:48:47,775
I gotta...

716
00:48:47,858 --> 00:48:49,525
All right.

717
00:48:50,108 --> 00:48:51,525
Bye, Joe.

718
00:48:51,608 --> 00:48:52,983
Bye, Marsha.

719
00:49:00,192 --> 00:49:04,442
[Jamie] Mary Roberts.
Paige Callahan, Tamara Ewing.

720
00:49:05,608 --> 00:49:06,942
I only asked for Roberts.

721
00:49:07,025 --> 00:49:08,525
Yeah, well,
all the victims were hookers,

722
00:49:08,608 --> 00:49:10,650
they were all found drugged
and stabbed to death

723
00:49:10,733 --> 00:49:11,942
on the same night
in the same location.

724
00:49:12,025 --> 00:49:13,108
You gotta be kidding me.

725
00:49:13,192 --> 00:49:14,608
Yeah, I'm hilarious.

726
00:49:16,317 --> 00:49:18,317
- [rock music playing]
- [indistinct chatter]

727
00:49:20,358 --> 00:49:22,983
I never figured
you to be so hip.

728
00:49:23,067 --> 00:49:24,608
[Deke chuckles]

729
00:49:24,692 --> 00:49:26,900
Yeah, they must have...

730
00:49:26,983 --> 00:49:29,483
must have changed owners.

731
00:49:29,567 --> 00:49:32,317
You want something to drink?

732
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,317
Don't worry, I won't tell.

733
00:49:37,442 --> 00:49:39,525
Where are you from? Originally.

734
00:49:39,608 --> 00:49:41,442
The Valley.

735
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,025
Where are you from?

736
00:49:44,108 --> 00:49:46,317
- Originally.
- Mississippi Valley.

737
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,817
Alabama, Birmingham.

738
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:50,775
Well, here's to being
from somewhere.

739
00:49:50,858 --> 00:49:52,525
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

740
00:49:54,442 --> 00:49:55,817
All right,
last night's victims...

741
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:56,900
so we got six now.

742
00:49:56,983 --> 00:49:58,442
One, Julie Brock,
never left home.

743
00:49:58,525 --> 00:50:00,233
Three from the north county,
bodies dumped here.

744
00:50:00,317 --> 00:50:02,483
Two from here,
bodies dumped in north county.

745
00:50:02,567 --> 00:50:04,067
And who said
busing doesn't work?

746
00:50:04,192 --> 00:50:05,650
All knifed, all gagged,
all bound,

747
00:50:05,733 --> 00:50:06,858
all very organized killings.

748
00:50:06,942 --> 00:50:08,692
Not a lot of wasted motion.

749
00:50:08,775 --> 00:50:10,900
- So, I got a question. Why?
- Why what?

750
00:50:10,983 --> 00:50:12,858
First, geography.

751
00:50:12,942 --> 00:50:14,942
Yep. Guy's a shark.
If he stops, he dies.

752
00:50:15,025 --> 00:50:16,900
He likes to drive.
Probably has a decent car.

753
00:50:16,983 --> 00:50:19,317
Maybe two. High mileage.

754
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:23,692
Can't find one
in the neighborhood, a victim,

755
00:50:23,775 --> 00:50:26,025
then, uh, he goes
wherever opportunity knocks.

756
00:50:26,108 --> 00:50:28,775
All right, next "why." Why the
extreme torture, then the love bites?

757
00:50:28,858 --> 00:50:30,025
Turns him on.

758
00:50:30,108 --> 00:50:32,150
No rape, no sodomy,

759
00:50:32,233 --> 00:50:35,108
- no genital mutilation. Hm.
- He kills for sexual pleasure.

760
00:50:35,942 --> 00:50:37,983
Was Stan Peters our boy?

761
00:50:38,983 --> 00:50:40,858
God, I hope not.

762
00:50:41,983 --> 00:50:43,692
All right, back to the living.
Our boy.

763
00:50:43,775 --> 00:50:46,108
He's got balls.
I'll give him that. [scoffs]

764
00:50:46,192 --> 00:50:48,233
He goes back to Julie's house,

765
00:50:48,317 --> 00:50:52,233
a few days after he kills her,
moves her body, shaves her legs,

766
00:50:52,317 --> 00:50:55,692
poses her, he brings beer,

767
00:50:55,775 --> 00:50:58,483
milk, food. Just threw
himself a little party.

768
00:50:58,567 --> 00:51:01,025
And they found partially
digested meat in her stomach.

769
00:51:01,108 --> 00:51:03,067
But she was a vegan.
Strict vegetarian.

770
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:05,317
She'd never touch it.
Same as Ana. No way.

771
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,233
Not even with a knife
to her throat?

772
00:51:07,317 --> 00:51:08,692
Nobody wants to eat alone.

773
00:51:08,775 --> 00:51:09,733
[Jim] Mm.

774
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:11,817
One last "why."

775
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:13,650
Why are you trying to solve
a five-year-old case

776
00:51:13,733 --> 00:51:15,775
that everyone else
has forgotten about?

777
00:51:17,192 --> 00:51:19,483
[suspenseful music playing]

778
00:51:38,858 --> 00:51:41,108
Farris and I were...

779
00:51:42,858 --> 00:51:47,025
a couple of miles away.
We heard a call over the radio.

780
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:52,192
Screams reported.
Sal was first one on the scene.

781
00:51:55,233 --> 00:51:57,108
No lights.

782
00:51:57,192 --> 00:52:01,567
Switching problem. Guy from Edison said
it happens once every decade or so.

783
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:04,692
Now, you see the woman
behind me

784
00:52:04,775 --> 00:52:06,192
- over my left shoulder?
- Yeah.

785
00:52:06,275 --> 00:52:08,150
Gladys Fulcher. Spinster.

786
00:52:08,233 --> 00:52:10,817
Sort of eyes and ears
of the neighborhood.

787
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:14,150
A pain in the ass to the cops
but a godsend to a detective.

788
00:52:14,233 --> 00:52:16,692
And what did good old
Gladys have to say?

789
00:52:16,775 --> 00:52:20,150
Said she was out. She lied about it
at first out of sheer embarrassment,

790
00:52:20,233 --> 00:52:22,275
but she came clean.

791
00:52:22,358 --> 00:52:24,567
What was she embarrassed about?

792
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:27,525
She went on her first date in 15
years, slept at the old guy's house.

793
00:52:27,608 --> 00:52:29,025
[chuckles]

794
00:52:29,108 --> 00:52:33,108
So, the night of the hat trick,
we had no lights,

795
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:35,400
Gladys getting boned...

796
00:52:35,483 --> 00:52:39,567
two-million-to-one long shot
crossing the finish line

797
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:40,983
in a dead heat.

798
00:52:42,108 --> 00:52:43,400
Third strike.

799
00:52:45,483 --> 00:52:46,317
Drought.

800
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:51,192
No water, no mud, no prints.

801
00:52:52,442 --> 00:52:54,358
Ground was hard like cement.

802
00:52:55,775 --> 00:52:57,817
Victims were placed
on that rock right there.

803
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:00,567
They were drugged elsewhere, but they
were brought here, stabbed to death.

804
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:03,358
Posed facing each other,

805
00:53:03,442 --> 00:53:07,983
bags over their heads, laid down,
like the rock was a table, like a...

806
00:53:09,483 --> 00:53:11,192
tea party.

807
00:53:11,275 --> 00:53:12,817
Where the guests fell asleep.

808
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:19,817
Warm. This just went down.

809
00:53:21,275 --> 00:53:23,400
And where was
your third victim?

810
00:53:23,483 --> 00:53:25,567
[Deke] Close by.

811
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:29,358
You work the evidence,
you still come up with zeros.

812
00:53:29,442 --> 00:53:31,525
It's all you can do.
Happens to everybody.

813
00:53:31,608 --> 00:53:36,567
Then you draw the black bean.

814
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:40,567
Maybe the victim looks like
a kid you picked on in school

815
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:44,025
or the green eyes
remind you of your old lady.

816
00:53:44,108 --> 00:53:46,733
Or maybe it's something else,
but whatever it is,

817
00:53:46,817 --> 00:53:49,108
they're your lifelong
responsibility, Jimmy.

818
00:53:49,192 --> 00:53:50,983
You own them.

819
00:53:54,483 --> 00:53:56,442
You own them.

820
00:54:04,483 --> 00:54:08,567
They're wherever they are,
and you are their angel,

821
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:15,150
trying like hell to turn the
ledger from red to black.

822
00:54:15,233 --> 00:54:18,275
Word to the wise, Jimmy,
stay out of the angel business.

823
00:54:18,358 --> 00:54:19,942
[Jim] Hey.

824
00:54:20,025 --> 00:54:23,317
What is it you're looking for
in all of this?

825
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:27,192
To finish the job.

826
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:35,692
Just like you.

827
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:37,192
[Jim] <i>It's not the same boy.</i>

828
00:54:37,275 --> 00:54:39,150
Guys that kill pros
are a different breed

829
00:54:39,233 --> 00:54:41,025
than the ones
that go after solid citizens.

830
00:54:41,108 --> 00:54:42,483
Yeah, nobody's that good
out of the block.

831
00:54:42,567 --> 00:54:44,608
This boy practiced his trade
somewhere before.

832
00:54:44,692 --> 00:54:46,025
Well, it can't be the same guy.

833
00:54:46,108 --> 00:54:48,858
He's a shark, remember?
He stops, he dies.

834
00:54:48,942 --> 00:54:50,608
Who said he stopped? Maybe he
just took his show on the road.

835
00:54:50,692 --> 00:54:52,067
I'm over here on the right.

836
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,983
Two of the five appliance
store employees have records.

837
00:54:58,067 --> 00:55:01,608
One's 55, the other one's in his
late thirties, lives in Hollywood.

838
00:55:01,692 --> 00:55:03,275
Both simple assaults.

839
00:55:03,358 --> 00:55:04,983
It looks like a wash to me,

840
00:55:05,067 --> 00:55:07,483
but you got all the info there.

841
00:55:07,567 --> 00:55:10,775
And for the record, your hunch?
I don't think it holds water.

842
00:55:10,858 --> 00:55:12,400
Then why all the interest?

843
00:55:12,483 --> 00:55:15,442
You wanna clear your
conscience, that's your problem.

844
00:55:15,525 --> 00:55:18,817
But you gotta solve my case to
solve yours, who am I to moan?

845
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,400
[scoffs]

846
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:24,025
But you piss on my leg and call it
rain, we're through.

847
00:55:24,108 --> 00:55:27,858
Hey, uh, what was
Julie's last supper?

848
00:55:29,567 --> 00:55:32,150
It was roast beef. Why?

849
00:55:32,233 --> 00:55:36,233
It's the little things
that are important, Jimmy.

850
00:55:36,317 --> 00:55:38,775
It's the little things
that get you caught.

851
00:55:59,025 --> 00:56:00,483
[engine idling]

852
00:56:06,358 --> 00:56:07,317
[engine stops]

853
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:25,817
[man] Can I help you?

854
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:34,067
[Deke] I saw
the "for sale" sign.

855
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:35,942
That was for another car.

856
00:56:36,025 --> 00:56:39,025
Got a lot of miles on it.
You a... you a salesman?

857
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:41,442
No.

858
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:44,108
How's the trunk space?

859
00:56:49,483 --> 00:56:51,400
It's standard.

860
00:56:51,483 --> 00:56:52,900
Mind if I take a look?

861
00:56:54,108 --> 00:56:55,692
I'm in the market.

862
00:56:57,650 --> 00:56:58,775
It's not for sale.

863
00:56:58,858 --> 00:57:00,900
All I need to do is
take a look.

864
00:57:02,317 --> 00:57:05,025
You must really like my car.

865
00:57:05,108 --> 00:57:06,733
- I do.
- [chuckles]

866
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:26,942
[suspenseful music playing]

867
00:57:35,192 --> 00:57:36,900
[indistinct chatter]

868
00:57:41,192 --> 00:57:42,525
[Deke] Hey, Sal, listen.

869
00:57:42,608 --> 00:57:45,400
Run a DMV check
on an Albert Leonard Sparma.

870
00:57:45,483 --> 00:57:47,733
Yeah, see if he's sold any cars
in the last few months.

871
00:57:53,192 --> 00:57:54,442
[sniffs]

872
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:19,567
Inconclusive.

873
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:22,983
But there are some similarities
to both Brock and Ewing.

874
00:58:23,067 --> 00:58:25,067
Partial of an incisor
on Ewing's cheek.

875
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:26,400
What about Brock?

876
00:58:26,483 --> 00:58:29,483

01:11:37,233 --> 01:11:38,483
[whispers] Is that for me?

1054
01:11:38,567 --> 01:11:41,192
You get the feeling
he's enjoying this?

1055
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:45,483
Oh, yeah.

1056
01:11:45,567 --> 01:11:47,775
Pineapples and jalapenos,
please.

1057
01:11:52,567 --> 01:11:54,067
Can I come in?

1058
01:11:59,233 --> 01:12:01,525
Eleven more,
you can make a calendar.

1059
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:03,817
Uh-oh.

1060
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:05,983
Oh, hey, stranger.

1061
01:12:06,067 --> 01:12:08,525
Tired of steaming up
that glass?

1062
01:12:10,233 --> 01:12:11,150
Pressies?

1063
01:12:11,233 --> 01:12:12,692
Oh, yeah.

1064
01:12:16,817 --> 01:12:22,483
This is the part where I start
feeling like it's a trap.

1065
01:12:22,567 --> 01:12:23,942
Open it up, find out.

1066
01:12:24,025 --> 01:12:25,317
[chuckles softly]

1067
01:12:28,775 --> 01:12:30,442
It's not a pair of mittens.

1068
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:34,567
[sighs]

1069
01:12:37,108 --> 01:12:38,817
[clicks tongue] Wow.

1070
01:12:40,775 --> 01:12:43,233
[Deke] Go on, take a look.

1071
01:12:43,317 --> 01:12:44,650
You know you want to.

1072
01:12:44,733 --> 01:12:47,025
Open it, you fucking weirdo.

1073
01:13:04,983 --> 01:13:07,317
Holy guacamole.

1074
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:11,650
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe,

1075
01:13:11,733 --> 01:13:14,483
catch a dead girl by her toe.

1076
01:13:16,942 --> 01:13:18,442
Oh...

1077
01:13:19,942 --> 01:13:22,442
[Albert inhales deeply]

1078
01:13:22,525 --> 01:13:24,983
The contrast is all off.

1079
01:13:26,483 --> 01:13:27,942
It's no Weegee.

1080
01:13:29,150 --> 01:13:30,275
[Albert scoffs]

1081
01:13:31,608 --> 01:13:32,692
My God.

1082
01:14:03,817 --> 01:14:05,608
Let me ask you a question.

1083
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:08,817
Why is that?

1084
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:10,817
Huh?

1085
01:14:11,775 --> 01:14:13,400
Why is that?

1086
01:14:23,525 --> 01:14:26,275
[Deke] Hm? Come on,
you're a smart man.

1087
01:14:26,358 --> 01:14:28,483
You know every exit
on the highway.

1088
01:14:31,692 --> 01:14:32,692
Let me help you.

1089
01:14:34,567 --> 01:14:35,775
[chair slides]

1090
01:14:38,233 --> 01:14:39,983
I mean it.

1091
01:14:40,692 --> 01:14:41,900
Why?

1092
01:14:50,775 --> 01:14:53,025
Why not?

1093
01:14:53,108 --> 01:14:56,483
Son of a bitch. Your dick is
as hard as Chinese arithmetic.

1094
01:14:56,567 --> 01:14:57,942
- Shit.
- Son of a...

1095
01:14:58,025 --> 01:14:59,692
- [Jim] Deke! Hey, Deke!
- [Deke] That's why.

1096
01:14:59,775 --> 01:15:01,317
- That's why.
- [Jim] Back off!

1097
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:03,942
- Why is that? Why is that?
- [Sal] Deke! Hey! Whoa!

1098
01:15:04,025 --> 01:15:05,192
- That's what I wanna know.
- [Jim] Back off.

1099
01:15:05,275 --> 01:15:06,567
[Sal] Hey. Hey.

1100
01:15:06,650 --> 01:15:08,192
[Deke] It's all right.
It's all right, Sal.

1101
01:15:08,275 --> 01:15:09,983
We know, you know...

1102
01:15:10,067 --> 01:15:11,400
[Albert giggles]

1103
01:15:11,483 --> 01:15:13,108
...we got you by the balls,
small as they are.

1104
01:15:13,192 --> 01:15:14,733
You son of a bitch.

1105
01:15:15,775 --> 01:15:17,275
You lost control.

1106
01:15:19,275 --> 01:15:20,275
[Albert exhales]

1107
01:15:21,775 --> 01:15:22,942
[door closes]

1108
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:31,608
- [phone rings]
- Rizoli.

1109
01:15:31,692 --> 01:15:33,733
- Huh. Jimmy, it's your wife.
- Take a message.

1110
01:15:48,483 --> 01:15:50,025
[breathes sharply]

1111
01:15:50,108 --> 01:15:51,275
What do you think?

1112
01:15:51,358 --> 01:15:54,233
Maybe if I could
get a better look at him.

1113
01:15:54,317 --> 01:15:56,817
[Jim] What do you mean,
a better look?

1114
01:15:58,067 --> 01:16:01,525
[hesitates] Well, at this guy.

1115
01:16:01,608 --> 01:16:05,275
I mean, you have him
here in the station, right?

1116
01:16:13,150 --> 01:16:14,358
Thank you, Tina.

1117
01:16:18,983 --> 01:16:20,317
[slams on chair]

1118
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:23,567
[Jamie] <i>Look, I'm sorry.
What about a lineup?</i>

1119
01:16:23,650 --> 01:16:24,983
We've got no cause.

1120
01:16:25,067 --> 01:16:27,067
I mean, the ID is
tainted beyond repair.

1121
01:16:27,150 --> 01:16:29,567
She saw him in cuffs,
for God's sake.

1122
01:16:29,650 --> 01:16:31,108
[Carl] <i>I told you.
I warned you.</i>

1123
01:16:31,192 --> 01:16:32,150
[Jim] <i>I take the heat.</i>

1124
01:16:32,233 --> 01:16:33,608
- I'm the primary.
- For now.

1125
01:16:33,692 --> 01:16:35,442
What the hell does that mean?

1126
01:16:35,525 --> 01:16:39,025
It means I got six bodies, no
witnesses, no evidence, no killer.

1127
01:16:39,108 --> 01:16:41,525
Two guys questioned,
and why are they suspects?

1128
01:16:41,608 --> 01:16:43,942
One, who later sucks
on a 12-gauge,

1129
01:16:44,025 --> 01:16:45,317
for malicious unzipping.

1130
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:47,150
The other, for carrying
a concealed hard-on.

1131
01:16:47,233 --> 01:16:49,817
- What do you want the DA to do?
- He was visualizing the crime.

1132
01:16:50,525 --> 01:16:51,692
His crime.

1133
01:16:51,775 --> 01:16:53,025
Well, sheriff's calling
in the feds.

1134
01:16:53,108 --> 01:16:54,650
They got a guy
coming in on Monday.

1135
01:16:54,733 --> 01:16:57,192
That point, we back off,
we revamp.

1136
01:16:58,233 --> 01:17:01,067
- Revamp?
- They take charge.

1137
01:17:03,192 --> 01:17:05,275
Hey, uh, one more thing.

1138
01:17:05,358 --> 01:17:10,025
Were you aware Sparma confessed
to a murder eight years ago?

1139
01:17:10,108 --> 01:17:11,400
[Rogers] Guy walks in...

1140
01:17:12,650 --> 01:17:14,858
and we spent ten hours
going over the thing.

1141
01:17:14,942 --> 01:17:19,275
He signs a confession.
Next morning, we had to cut him loose.

1142
01:17:19,358 --> 01:17:20,858
- Why?
- [Rogers] He was lying.

1143
01:17:20,942 --> 01:17:22,317
I mean,
he knew all the details,

1144
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:25,067
but he wasn't within
ten miles of the killing.

1145
01:17:28,817 --> 01:17:30,692
Still got two days, right, Cap?

1146
01:17:32,317 --> 01:17:34,108
Hey, what is it with
you and Deke?

1147
01:17:34,192 --> 01:17:37,150
You wanna be the one that finds
him after his next heart attack?

1148
01:17:37,233 --> 01:17:39,192
It's his destiny,
don't make it yours.

1149
01:17:50,192 --> 01:17:51,775
Deacon.

1150
01:17:54,942 --> 01:17:56,108
[doorknob rattles]

1151
01:17:57,900 --> 01:17:59,400
[tense music playing]

1152
01:18:25,942 --> 01:18:27,192
[Deke] Boo.

1153
01:18:36,942 --> 01:18:38,817
What is... what is all this?

1154
01:18:42,483 --> 01:18:47,358
The past becomes the future,
becomes the past...

1155
01:18:47,442 --> 01:18:50,108
becomes the future,
becomes the past, becomes the...

1156
01:18:50,192 --> 01:18:52,442
- Hey. Look at me.
- Becomes the future.

1157
01:18:52,525 --> 01:18:53,900
This is sick.

1158
01:18:53,983 --> 01:18:56,067
- You need to get some help.
- Don't point fingers.

1159
01:18:56,150 --> 01:18:58,692
I know all the symptoms.

1160
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:03,192
Congratulations.
We got a suspect.

1161
01:19:03,275 --> 01:19:04,525
Oh, we do, do we?

1162
01:19:04,608 --> 01:19:06,233
Yeah.

1163
01:19:06,317 --> 01:19:07,650
Are you aware that Sparma confessed
to a murder eight years ago?

1164
01:19:07,733 --> 01:19:09,275
So what?

1165
01:19:09,358 --> 01:19:11,817
He walked in, jerked Rogers'
chain for an entire shift.

1166
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:13,817
He's a crime buff,
he said so himself.

1167
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:15,525
Walk-in confessors
aren't killers.

1168
01:19:15,608 --> 01:19:17,108
We don't have shit!

1169
01:19:17,192 --> 01:19:19,025
You got the same ache
in your gut as I do, don't you?

1170
01:19:19,108 --> 01:19:21,317
We got something,
we just don't know what it is.

1171
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:25,567
If I can get in Sparma's apartment
for just five minutes, I know...

1172
01:19:25,650 --> 01:19:27,067
We don't have enough
for a warrant.

1173
01:19:27,150 --> 01:19:28,233
...like I'm standing
in front of you.

1174
01:19:28,317 --> 01:19:29,233
I know.

1175
01:19:29,317 --> 01:19:30,733
Know what?

1176
01:19:30,817 --> 01:19:34,108
I know that the answer is
inside Sparma's place. I know.

1177
01:19:37,608 --> 01:19:39,775
Let me ask you something,
Jimmy.

1178
01:19:43,150 --> 01:19:44,275
What do you want?

1179
01:19:44,358 --> 01:19:45,733
I wanna nail the bastard.

1180
01:19:45,817 --> 01:19:46,775
For who?

1181
01:19:46,858 --> 01:19:49,483
For all of the girls he killed.

1182
01:19:51,233 --> 01:19:54,025
And for Ronda Rathbun,
wherever she is.

1183
01:19:54,108 --> 01:19:56,817
[Deke] Well, I wanna
nail the bastard, too.

1184
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:58,858
Difference is...

1185
01:20:00,483 --> 01:20:02,400
I'm doing it for me.

1186
01:20:05,275 --> 01:20:07,150
Just five minutes, Jimmy.

1187
01:20:08,233 --> 01:20:09,817
Please.

1188

make it up to you in person.</i>

1190
01:20:14,733 --> 01:20:19,400
Meet me at Pike's,
near your place, on the bully.

I'll hit the horn twice.

in the details, Jimmy.

1402
01:42:11,192 --> 01:42:13,442
Witnesses, physical evidence.

1403
01:42:13,525 --> 01:42:16,358
You'd have to get rid of
my body, get rid of my car.

1404
01:42:16,442 --> 01:42:18,275
It's a lot to consider.

1405
01:42:18,358 --> 01:42:19,983
[Albert grunts]

1406
01:42:21,483 --> 01:42:22,442
Besides...

1407
01:42:25,567 --> 01:42:27,733
it's a peace offering.

1408
01:42:36,733 --> 01:42:38,067
Okay.

1409
01:43:10,650 --> 01:43:12,817
Oh, you're gonna kill me.

1410
01:43:12,900 --> 01:43:13,817
Uh...

1411
01:43:16,442 --> 01:43:18,442
Oh, poop.

1412
01:43:19,400 --> 01:43:21,025
I think I made a boo-boo.

1413
01:43:21,108 --> 01:43:25,483
Yeah. Come to think of it,
this doesn't look that familiar.

1414
01:43:25,567 --> 01:43:27,650
But this one over here...

1415
01:43:29,692 --> 01:43:32,192
this looks very promising.

1416
01:43:35,525 --> 01:43:36,858
Yeah, that's it.

1417
01:43:36,942 --> 01:43:38,025
What did you say?

1418
01:43:38,108 --> 01:43:39,400
[Albert] Um...

1419
01:43:39,942 --> 01:43:41,608
"Poop."

1420
01:43:41,692 --> 01:43:45,525
[hesitates] Then,
"This one is more promising."

1421
01:43:49,650 --> 01:43:52,775
It's not like
I have a fucking treasure map.

1422
01:44:03,067 --> 01:44:05,692
[Jim] I keep digging,
you keep talking.

1423
01:44:31,858 --> 01:44:34,275
[Albert] X marks the spot.

1424
01:44:36,900 --> 01:44:38,358
Third time's the charm.

1425
01:44:38,442 --> 01:44:39,858
[panting]

1426
01:44:42,692 --> 01:44:45,108
It's like the cereal aisle.

1427
01:44:52,692 --> 01:44:54,733
You want the truth?

1428
01:44:59,317 --> 01:45:02,192
I've never killed anybody
in my entire life.

1429
01:45:05,192 --> 01:45:07,817
If you believe me, we can get in the
car and we can drive straight home.

1430
01:45:07,900 --> 01:45:10,067
Maybe even stop for tacos.

1431
01:45:11,483 --> 01:45:12,900
If not...

1432
01:45:45,900 --> 01:45:48,233
- [shoveling]
- That's it.

1433
01:45:49,775 --> 01:45:51,733
Not too much longer now.

1434
01:46:04,108 --> 01:46:07,983
What are you, five, six deep,
and no end in sight?

1435
01:46:08,692 --> 01:46:10,358
[Jim grunting]

1436
01:46:13,108 --> 01:46:14,775
Oh...

1437
01:46:14,858 --> 01:46:17,192
I forgot to tell you.

1438
01:46:17,275 --> 01:46:19,192
I've seen a picture
of your family.

1439
01:46:20,192 --> 01:46:21,858
[chuckles]

1440
01:46:21,942 --> 01:46:24,900
You should've stayed out
of the public eye, Jimmy.

1441
01:46:26,650 --> 01:46:29,858
You and your ego.

1442
01:46:31,817 --> 01:46:34,525
I mean, what kind of
a father are you?

1443
01:46:35,942 --> 01:46:38,067
How can you protect
those two beautiful daughters

1444
01:46:38,150 --> 01:46:41,400
when you can't even
begin to help one...

1445
01:46:41,483 --> 01:46:44,442
of those poor girls
or their families?

1446
01:46:47,775 --> 01:46:49,650
You're insignificant.

1447
01:46:50,858 --> 01:46:52,233
You don't matter.

1448
01:46:54,108 --> 01:46:57,233
And this will go on
and on and on.

1449
01:46:59,317 --> 01:47:00,942
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

1450
01:47:16,858 --> 01:47:18,192
[Jim breathing shakily]

1451
01:47:19,442 --> 01:47:22,608
Hey. Hey. Hey, get up.

1452
01:47:23,900 --> 01:47:25,358
Get up, man.

1453
01:47:28,900 --> 01:47:30,400
Get up!

1454
01:47:31,483 --> 01:47:32,858
Get up!

1455
01:47:32,942 --> 01:47:34,733
[ominous music playing]

1456
01:47:36,150 --> 01:47:37,650
[breathing heavily]

1457
01:47:47,733 --> 01:47:49,025
[gasps softly]

1458
01:48:27,025 --> 01:48:29,317
- [Sal] Deke, what is it?
- [whispers] Quiet.

1459
01:48:29,900 --> 01:48:31,192
[gunshot echoes]

1460
01:48:31,692 --> 01:48:33,025
[gasps]

1461
01:48:34,692 --> 01:48:35,775
Oh.

1462
01:48:37,358 --> 01:48:38,733
[body thuds]

1463
01:48:38,817 --> 01:48:40,900
[Carl] Oh, shit.

1464
01:48:40,983 --> 01:48:43,358
[Deke] <i>The past becomes the
future, becomes the past...</i>

01:48:47,567 --> 01:48:49,567
<i>becomes the future.</i>

1468
01:49:13,233 --> 01:49:14,942
It was him.

1469
01:49:16,775 --> 01:49:19,108
We got him. He was our boy.

1470
01:49:21,650 --> 01:49:24,150
He was our boy.
He as much as told me.

1471
01:49:24,233 --> 01:49:25,983
Nothing you can do
about it now.

1472
01:49:26,983 --> 01:49:28,358
We gotta call somebody.

1473
01:49:32,192 --> 01:49:33,442
What am I gonna say?

1474
01:49:35,858 --> 01:49:37,692
What am I gonna do?

1475
01:49:37,775 --> 01:49:40,275
Nothing. You're not gonna say
anything, you're not gonna do anything.

1476
01:49:40,358 --> 01:49:42,233
You're gonna find a hole,
stick him in it.

1477
01:49:42,317 --> 01:49:45,858
Pick one at least four feet deep.
I'll be back in a few hours.

1478
01:49:54,483 --> 01:49:56,233
[suspenseful music playing]

1479
01:50:30,358 --> 01:50:31,817
[man 1] What'd she say, man?

1480
01:50:31,900 --> 01:50:33,442
[man 2] What's up with homeboy
there?

1481
01:50:39,150 --> 01:50:40,733
Hey.

1482
01:51:27,983 --> 01:51:30,192
[suspenseful music continues]

1483
01:52:26,317 --> 01:52:27,650
[digging]

1484

[clanking]

1485
01:53:08,025 --> 01:53:09,942
He was our boy, Deke.
I'm sure he was our boy.

1486
01:53:10,025 --> 01:53:12,567
Nobody's gonna give a damn.
I've taken care of it.

1487
01:53:12,650 --> 01:53:14,650
So, listen...

1488
01:53:14,733 --> 01:53:16,983
you go back,

1489
01:53:17,067 --> 01:53:21,150
you tell Farris
that Sparma was a wash,

1490
01:53:21,233 --> 01:53:23,067
and that you need a break.

1491
01:53:23,150 --> 01:53:28,150
A couple of weeks. You tell him
I left town Saturday,

1492
01:53:28,233 --> 01:53:29,358
and you went home.

1493
01:53:30,442 --> 01:53:32,525
Are you listening to me?

1494
01:53:34,900 --> 01:53:36,733
He's dead.

1495
01:53:36,817 --> 01:53:38,650
He's forgotten.
He's rotting in the ground

1496
01:53:38,733 --> 01:53:41,442
and the only way he's gonna come
back is if you let him come back.

1497
01:53:43,317 --> 01:53:44,650
Don't you ever go back to his
place,

1498
01:53:44,733 --> 01:53:47,817
don't you ever let his name
cross your lips,

1499
01:53:47,900 --> 01:53:50,525
don't you ever pull his file,
'cause if you do...

1500
01:53:50,608 --> 01:53:54,400
he'll rise up out of that
ground. He'll do you in.

1501
01:53:57,275 --> 01:53:59,817
It's the little things, Jimmy.

1502
01:53:59,900 --> 01:54:01,942
It's the little things
that rip you apart,

1503
01:54:02,025 --> 01:54:03,400
it's the little things that...

1504
01:54:04,442 --> 01:54:06,567
get you caught.

1505
01:54:21,900 --> 01:54:23,442
That's my boy.

1506
01:54:37,067 --> 01:54:38,775

Joe...
