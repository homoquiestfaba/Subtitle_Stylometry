OK, ladies, let's
get this started.

5
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:33,401
Big game tomorrow.

6
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:35,869
Here we go, five,
six, seven, eight.

Will you shut up?

9
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:45,273
Some of us are trying to make
the most of our education.

10
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:49,710
Mockery.

11
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,945
How can you work
with that noise?

12
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:54,415
Used to it, I guess.

13
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:56,450
Jesus, would you
listen to that?

14
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,219
It's repulsive.

15
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:00,521
Just ignore it
like everyone else.

16
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:01,922
That's the problem.

17
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:04,091
We ignore and they
think it's OK.

18
00:02:04,192 --> 00:02:06,527
Half naked cheers to
mindless violence.

19
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:09,830
This is not higher education.

20
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,465
We've got to do something.

21
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:12,733
This is high school.

22
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,535
What are we going to do?

23
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,937
No, that's highschool.

24
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:20,608
This is Vo-Tech.

Same building,

Up there, it's nothing but...
But cheerleading and football.

28

Hey, pube face,
what do you think?

31
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:47,335
High school's just one
big meaningless sex

32

33
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:52,973

He agrees with me.

38
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:06,354
OK, OK, so what can we do?

39
00:03:06,454 --> 00:03:09,990
They shit on our world,
we shit on theirs.

Cool, cool.

41
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:12,560

going to learn?

say, hygiene first.

00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:06,840

that as of today,

We all want to
know how do you it?

102
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:27,648
Lucy, the team's in great
shape and we're working hard.

103
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:30,718
But the single most important
factor to our winning streak

104
00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:32,452
Is the raging Rocky
Mountain fever

105
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:33,821
Running wild in this school.

106
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:36,624
And as long as our fans
support us, we'll kick ass.

107
00:07:36,724 --> 00:07:40,494
Catch the fever,
it's contagious.

108
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:41,294
Wow.

109
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:53,841

Killer, Mitch the Oven,

And Ritchie the Idiot.

111
00:07:55,543 --> 00:07:57,077
Guys, do you agree
with your team captain

112
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:59,346
When he says school spirit
has carried you through you

113
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:00,548
Five game winning streak?

114
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:02,115
School spirit my ass, Lucy.

115
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:04,117
We're natural born
killing machines.

116
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,185
We won't be stopped.

117
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:06,587
Yeah.

118
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:10,123
Any one who doesn't agree with
that gets thrown in the oven.

119
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:11,825
Yeah.

120
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:16,329
I... I... I played football.

121
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:18,265
Yeah.

122
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:19,733
You heard it here first.

123
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:32,012
I think it's a travesty, that
while so much suffering is

124
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:34,181
Visible in our
school, you people

125
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:37,450
Center on something as trivial
and as violent as football.

126
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:39,352
What about the students that
are mathematically deficient

127
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:40,988
And can't find proper tutoring?

128
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:42,990
Do the care about football?

129
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:46,994
Or the lactose intolerant, there
is not a substitute for milk

130
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:49,196
Available in the
school cafeteria.

131
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:50,931
Or, the baby seal...

132
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,833
Here's our school
mascot with a comment

punishment kills freaks.

Ah-ha, I knew I was popular.

136
00:09:01,609 --> 00:09:04,377
I would like to take this time
to acknowledge the unpopular.

137
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:05,879
OK, she's gone, let's go.

138
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,819
Hey, baby.

139
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,821
Come on, what are you
doing Friday night?

140
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:17,791
Come on, we got
something going on... ugh.

Wendy, our sources have
linked you to the hall monitor.

144
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,357
Tell us, do you hold the
hall pass to his heart?

145
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:52,025
Well, you know, it's
hard being the most

146
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,927
Popular girl in school.

147
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:56,697
Sometimes I... I feel
like my private life

148
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:59,432
Is being broadcast all
over the PA system.

149
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,501
So in the interest
of privacy, well,

150
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,004
I... I can't confirm
that I'm romantically

151
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,173
Involved with the hall monitor.

152
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,075
I can say that it
only makes sense

153
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:09,810
That the most
popular boy in school

154
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,345
Would be with the
most popular girl.

155
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,847
And that would be me.

156
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:30,063
[Tires screeching]

157
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,604
Hall monitor, you
rule, man, woo.

158
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:50,317
Dan, our sources have
linked you with Wendy Pepper.

159
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:52,052
Tell us, is there
love in the hallway?

160
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:55,322
You want to stick that
thing somewhere else?

161
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:56,690
There have been
reports that the Vo-Tech

162
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,926
Is planning to retaliate
after yesterday's shooting.

163
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:02,095
Do you expect any trouble today?

164
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:05,866
If I'm lucky.

165
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:07,067
There you have it.

166
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,668
The start of another
exciting school day

167
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:10,570
At Rocky Mountain High.

168
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,572
This is Lucy McGregor
saying the note

169
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:17,544
That you pass in class will
eventually come back to you.

170
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:19,279
That's a wrap.

171
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:20,513
I'm better than this.

172
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,850
I'll never get a scholarship
with stories like these.

173
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:26,086
They're so junior high.

174
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,520
Let it go, Lucy.

175
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,157
Come on, got to
get to home room.

[Crow cawing]

177
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:47,007
Ew.

178
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,613
They brushed me off, Maurice.

179
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:57,517
Pushed me aside like a
weekend homework assignment.

180
00:11:57,617 --> 00:11:58,418
I'm dead.

181
00:11:58,518 --> 00:11:59,319
Do you hear me?

182
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:02,455
Finished, ruined.

183
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,292
You've got to help me, Maurice.

184
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,594
Maurice?

185
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:09,296
Huh?

186
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:10,597
You and me, right?

187
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:13,133
Together, we'll ride
those waves of popularity

188
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,334
Right back to the top.

189
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:16,369
What do you say?

190
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:19,172
Yeah, whatever, babe.

191
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:21,541
I'll do anything,
anything you say I

192
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:23,076
Have to do to be popular again.

193
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:25,445
I'll do it.

194
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:27,214
You know this kid?

195
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:28,982
The hall monitor?

196
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,018
Yeah, we did preschool together.

197
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:32,719
This kid is hot.

198
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,255
This kid is on fire.

199
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:37,891
Why hasn't he come to see me?

200
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:40,828
Can you imagine what I
could do for this kid?

201
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:44,231
Can you imagine what
this kid could do for me?

202
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:47,835
I could make principal
with this kid on my resume.

203
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:50,037
I think you're forgetting
what's most important here.

204
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:51,738
And what would that be?

205
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,106
Me.

206
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:55,308
I can sing, I can dance.

207
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:59,112
Shakespeare's like a
second language to me.

208
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:00,647
I am dead, Maurice.

209
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:05,018
Oh, wretched school, adieu.

210
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:10,057
Had I bit time to
regain my popularity.

211
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:17,130
Oh, I could tell you,
but alas, I am dead.

212
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:21,534
Oh, I am dead.

213
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,937
[Bell ringing]

214
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:25,505
Well, that's first period.

215
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,312
Good morning, class.

216
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:37,918
Today, we are going to learn
about the miracle of life,

217
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:42,189
The fragile and fascinating
process of the most

218
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:46,927
Beautiful gift on the planet.

219
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:50,797
Does everyone have a dead frog?

220
00:13:50,898 --> 00:13:52,665
I saw you on the
cover of the paper.

221
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:54,334
It was really brave
of you to stand up

222
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:56,236
To a Vo-Tech student like that.

223
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,038
TEACHER: Everyone,
grab a scalpel.

224
00:13:58,138 --> 00:13:59,406
Vo-Tech students are scum.

225
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,508
They don't deserve to be in the
same building as you and me.

226
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:02,943
TEACHER: That will make
your first incision

227
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:05,512
Right down through here.

228
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:09,716
You know, everyone thinks we
should be together, you and me.

229
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:12,619
Crazy, isn't it?

230
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:16,756
The most popular girl in
school and the hall monitor?

231
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:21,228
It would be a media
sensation, don't you think?

232
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:22,029
Well?

233
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:26,333
You know, I'm not
exactly hard up.

234
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:27,734
If you're going to be
like this, then maybe

235
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:29,336
I should just be out of here and
leave because I don't want to...

236
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:30,470
[Gunshot]
[gasp]

237
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:31,271
Oh, God.

238
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:36,043
I'm done.

239
00:14:36,143 --> 00:14:39,246
[Knocking]

240
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:41,448
For heaven's sake,
Daniel, put the gun away

241
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,650
Or I'll have take it for
the rest of the period.

242
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:54,661
Daniel Kashwood, please report
to the principal's office.

243
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:59,732
Well, Dan, I guess we'll discuss
this little incident later.

244
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:00,500
Super.

245
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:15,082
Yeah, yeah, but... I
know what you're saying,

246
00:15:15,182 --> 00:15:18,018
You're not hearing
what I'm saying.

247
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:21,688
Since I employed Daniel
Kashwood as... as hall monitor,

248
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:26,393
Tardiness is down 50%,
class skipping is down 75%,

249
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:30,597
And nobody in their right mind
runs in the halls anymore.

250
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:31,398
OK.

251
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:35,768
OK, I'll tell him.

252
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:38,171
But just for the record,
I think this stinks.

253
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:41,241
There is nothing wrong with
doing things a little bit

254
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:42,042
Differently.

255
00:15:46,213 --> 00:15:48,715
Problems in the bedroom?

256
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:50,250
Good morning, Daniel.

257
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,584
Have a seat.

258
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,786
I'd rather stand.

259
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,488
What's up?

260
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:58,591
We go back a long
way, you and I.

261
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:03,363
All the way back to the sixth
grade, if I remember correctly.

262
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,198
Cut to the chase, Marty.

263
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,567
I have an exam second period.

264
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:09,036
The chase?

265
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:12,172
Well, the chase is this.

266
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:15,975
That fun of yours is getting
me into a world of shit.

267
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:26,553
"Hall monitor maims another
in corridor conspiracy."

268
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,321
The press is killing us.

269
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:31,924
You're shooting students like
they're going out of season.

270
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:34,794
What am I going to do?

271
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:35,595
Thank me.

272
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:40,300
I like you, Dan.

273
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,002
I mean, you get results,
but the superintendent

274
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:45,205
Is breathing down my neck.

275
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:48,408
Mothers are afraid to send
their children to school.

276
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:52,345
I gotta listen to 'em.

277
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:57,016
Shooting students is not the
only way of disciplining them.

278
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:00,753
It's the most effective.

279
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:07,227
[Sigh]

280
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:10,630
Here it is, Daniel.

281
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:14,000
You use that gun only
in emergency situations.

282
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:15,001
No, you got it?

283
00:17:15,102 --> 00:17:16,203
Now, I mean it.

284
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:20,473
If not, I'm going to
take it away from you.

285
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:21,541
Is that all?

286
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:26,413
Well, it's not so bad.

287
00:17:26,513 --> 00:17:29,082
You can still rough
'em up a little.

288
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,956
Hey, cheer up, Daniel.

289
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:37,757
It's Friday.

290
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:43,029
The problem with being
on top is everybody

291
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,364
Wants to knock you back down.

292
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:48,768
Excuse me?

293
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:50,737
Thin walls, couldn't
help overhearing.

294
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,309
You see, they don't
understand you.

295
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,245
You have vision.

296
00:17:58,345 --> 00:17:59,879
These schmucks wouldn't
understand vision

297
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:00,913
If it kicked them in the balls.

298
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:03,416
It scares 'em, intimidates them.

299
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:04,884
They can't handle it.

300
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:09,189
I, on the other hand, was born
to handle your kind of vision.

301
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:09,989
I live for it.

302
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:16,296
I gotta get to class.

303
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:17,997
Stop by my office some time.

304
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,267
We'll talk about how the
most popular kid in school

305
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:21,234
Deserves to be treated.

306
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:25,372
Have a good day now.

307
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,512
What does a kid like that want?

308
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:36,015
[Phone ringing]

309
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,618
Maurice.

310
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:41,588
Wendy, baby, how are the grades?

311
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:43,556
Don't give me that
baby shit, Maury.

312
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:45,558
You promised me
the hall monitor.

313
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:47,427
You know, there are a lot
of high schools out there

314
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:49,662
That will be more than happy
to have me as a student.

315
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:52,199
Hey, don't hurt me like
that, I'm working on it.

316
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:53,966
The word is out.

317
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:56,002
Yeah, I mean, even
he isn't dating you,

318
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:58,271
Everyone will think that he is.

319
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:02,108
Yeah, I... I've already
written the break up story.

320
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:03,042
Really?

321
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,744
How do I come off?

322
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:08,047
MAURICE (ON PHONE): Oh, like
an angel, babe, like an angel.

323
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,916
You're a hero, Maury.

324
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:11,017
Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

325
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:12,485
Look, stop by my office.

326
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:17,490
Something just hit me.

327
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:22,395
What a kid.

328
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:27,634
Once we get the
fever to spread,

329
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:28,901
There's no way we'll lose.

330
00:19:31,438 --> 00:19:32,138
Yeah.

331
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:33,240
Screw the fever, Captain.

332
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,507
I'm starved tonight.

333
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:36,409
I got a hunger for
blood sucking fat heads.

334
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:37,544
They call it
football because you

335
00:19:37,644 --> 00:19:38,945
Kick the ball with your foot.

336
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:41,013
You're missing the
subtlety of the fever.

337
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:42,449
Yes, we'll break arms.

338
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:43,983
Yes, we'll draw blood...

339
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,552
Hey, Johnny, what are
you doing tonight oh.

340
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:47,487
Call me.

341
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:49,689
But without the fever,
it's all in vain.

342
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:50,990
It's all about purpose.

343
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,058
I don't know, Captain.

344
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:53,526
That's sounds like a
bunch of shit to me.

345
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:55,228
I play ball so I
can hurt people.

346
00:19:58,064 --> 00:20:00,767
You boys want to watch
where you're going?

347
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:02,935
What are you doing
down there, old man?

348
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,804
I'm only doing what
they say I has to do.

349
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:07,006
Keep the school clean,
that's what I'm doing.

350
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:13,179
Go ahead, laugh, you youngsters
think you own this school.

351
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,547
I'm keeping this place clean.

352
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:16,949
I've been doing it since
before you was a wet spot

353
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,018
On your mama's bed sheet.

354
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:21,187
How about I turn you
into a big wet spot

355
00:20:21,288 --> 00:20:22,522
Right here on the floor?

356
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:23,456
Ease up, Killer.

357
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,191
This guy's a part of the school.

358
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:26,559
I'm sure he could tell
you a thing or two

359
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:27,827
About the Rocky Mountain fever.

360
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:29,496
Go ahead, old guy.

361
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:31,264
Tell 'em how the fever
spans generations

362
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:33,099
And brings us all together.

363
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:34,967
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about, boy.

364
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:35,768
Fever?

365
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:37,670
I think you've got a fever.

366
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:38,838
It's making you hallucinate.

367
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:41,040
That's what I think.

368
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:41,808
Disbeliever.

369
00:20:51,318 --> 00:20:54,321
Remember, fill in the
bubbles neatly and cleanly.

370
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:57,757
After you've finished,
place the exams on my desk.

371
00:20:57,857 --> 00:20:58,558
Any questions?

372
00:20:58,658 --> 00:21:00,493
Oh, oh.

373
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:01,694
TEACHER: Yes, Carl?

374
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:03,129
Can I got to nurse's office?

375
00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:05,865
I don't feel so good.

376
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:07,334
We've been through
this before, Carl.

377
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:11,203
I'm sure you'd feel fine if
you'd studied last night.

378
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:13,406
You have 50 minutes.

379
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:14,206
Begin.

380
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:27,313
See anything interesting?

381
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:39,992
[Gunshot]

382
00:22:50,002 --> 00:22:51,738
I guess I should
have seen this coming.

383
00:22:51,838 --> 00:22:53,740
Marty, be reasonable.

384
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,374
How am I supposed to
dispose of the garbage

385
00:22:55,475 --> 00:22:57,009
Out there without my gun?

386
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:58,711
Maybe you ought to
try giving a demerit

387
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:00,279
Like a normal hall monitor?

388
00:23:04,851 --> 00:23:08,254
Look, Dan, I know how much
this job means to you, which

389
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:10,957
Is why I am not firing you.

390
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:13,926
Besides, it's a Friday.

391
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:14,894
What could happen?

392
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:24,837
[Crow cawing]

393
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:35,782
[Choking]

394
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,681
[Whistling]

395
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:17,423
I can't believe this,
a story, a real story.

396
00:24:17,524 --> 00:24:18,390
Is that thing on?

397
00:24:18,491 --> 00:24:21,728
All clear, Lucy.

398
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:25,565
This is Lucy McGregor reporting
live from the boy's lavatory.

399
00:24:25,665 --> 00:24:30,436
In a tragically ironic turn of
events, Kirk the Killer Kronos

400
00:24:30,537 --> 00:24:33,840
Has been, uh, killed.

401
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,775
Apparently, he was
strangled to death.

402
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:37,877
Details are sketchy,
but we hope to have

403
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,679
An answer by lunch time.

404
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:43,449
One can only imagine what kind
of sick and twisted person

405
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:46,085
Could do something
like this on a Friday.

406
00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:51,390
Our beloved Carrot
is on the scene.

407
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,561
Carrot, do have any words
of solace or comfort

408
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:57,830
To offer the rest
of the student body?

409
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,900
Yes, Lucy, yes, I do.

410
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,004
In times like this, it can be
hard to find a reason to go on.

411
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:09,776
I mean, this poor boy is dead.

412
00:25:09,876 --> 00:25:12,579
I know it can be hard to
accept that, but believe me,

413
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:15,682
He's dead.

414
00:25:15,782 --> 00:25:19,351
That's why we must be strong
and think of positive things,

415
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:27,093
Think of happy things,
things like... things like me.

416
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:28,561
That's it, get it off him.

417
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:29,528
Get it... ow.

418
00:25:29,629 --> 00:25:30,529
Look at me.

419
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:31,330
I'm alive.

420
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,465
I'm very, very alive.

421
00:25:33,566 --> 00:25:34,767
Cut it.

422
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:38,805
LUCY: How do you feel about
the murder of Kirk Kronos?

423
00:25:38,905 --> 00:25:41,207
Kirk is dead?

424
00:25:41,307 --> 00:25:43,610
Oh, my God.

425
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:46,045
I can't believe this.

426
00:25:46,145 --> 00:25:48,681
He has my CDs.

427
00:25:48,781 --> 00:25:50,817
How am I supposed
to get them back?

428
00:25:50,917 --> 00:25:52,184
Kirk?

429
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:54,220
He was the best damn defensive
tackle this school ever had

430
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,323
And a damn fine kid, damn fine.

431
00:25:57,423 --> 00:26:00,159
But I guess you have to
look at the bright time

432
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:01,193
In situations like this.

433
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:04,096
I mean, he was only
a defensive tackle

434
00:26:04,196 --> 00:26:05,665
And we have the
big game tonight.

435
00:26:05,765 --> 00:26:08,801
Thank God they didn't
get the quarterback.

436
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:13,105
Poor boy, that poor dead boy.

437
00:26:13,205 --> 00:26:15,942
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

438
00:26:16,042 --> 00:26:21,948
I can't possibly express the
deep sorrow that I'm feeling.

439
00:26:22,048 --> 00:26:24,283
Hey, are you slapping erasers?

440
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:28,520
Chalk dust kills
the ozone layer.

441
00:26:28,621 --> 00:26:30,122
I don't know if
you're aware of this,

442
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:33,860
But the victim didn't
have a hall pass.

443
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,197
Way I see it, he had it coming.

444
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:39,398
PRINCIPAL MARTY:
Dan, get over here.

445
00:26:43,302 --> 00:26:44,937
What do you got?

446
00:26:45,037 --> 00:26:46,272
Just this.

447
00:26:46,372 --> 00:26:48,340
They found it on
top of the body.

448
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,344
"To the kid I met in
the first grade, K-I-T."

449
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,246
Kirk the Killer.

450
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:55,281
KIT?

451
00:26:55,381 --> 00:26:58,217
Keep in touch.

452
00:26:58,317 --> 00:26:59,852
Nowadays, the kids
are too lazy to write

453
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:01,320
Out a complete thought.

454
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,755
What do you make of it?

455
00:27:02,855 --> 00:27:06,959
Well, looks like the rumors of
a Vo-Tech retaliation are true.

456
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:09,428
Looks like.

457
00:27:09,528 --> 00:27:10,229
Give me my gun.

458
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:12,965
Humph.

459
00:27:13,065 --> 00:27:14,934
You can't be serious.

460
00:27:15,034 --> 00:27:17,436
They killed a student.

461
00:27:17,536 --> 00:27:21,841
But not with a gun,
with a jock strap.

462
00:27:21,941 --> 00:27:23,843
It's very resourceful.

463
00:27:23,943 --> 00:27:26,946
You could learn something
from this killer.

464
00:27:27,046 --> 00:27:28,815
Let's get this wrapped up today.

465
00:27:28,915 --> 00:27:31,317
We don't want it ruining the
football game tonight, huh?

466
00:27:37,824 --> 00:27:38,691
Super.

467
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:40,359
[Bell ringing]

468
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:41,761
JONATHAN (ON TV): I
want the entire school

469
00:27:41,861 --> 00:27:44,163
To know that Kirk's death will
no way affect tonight's game.

470
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:46,065
I mean, we're all
real shook about it,

471
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:48,100
But our feelings are irrelevant.

472
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,736
We don't play football
for ourselves,

473
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:53,572
We play football for the fever
and the fever knows no death.

474
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,507
It's... it's eternal.

475
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:59,411
Catch the fever, it's conta...

476
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,447
Don't you ever go to class?

477
00:28:01,547 --> 00:28:03,215
It's not fair.

478
00:28:03,315 --> 00:28:05,084
They used to love me.

479
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:08,187
It used to be,
Carrot, do a cheer.

480
00:28:08,287 --> 00:28:09,956
Carrot, do a dance.

481
00:28:10,056 --> 00:28:12,992
Yo, Carrot, sing "Free Bird."

482
00:28:13,092 --> 00:28:14,727
You want to know what I think?

483
00:28:14,827 --> 00:28:17,329
I think if you spent less
time whining in my office

484
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,698
And more time out
there making it happen,

485
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:22,268
You could be popular again.

486
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:25,738
See, if you really wanted
it... if you really,

487
00:28:25,838 --> 00:28:29,909
Really wanted it... you'd
be farting in class,

488
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:33,079
Partying on weekends,
killing football players.

489
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:38,217
Now, see, now... now there
is a kid with ambition.

490
00:28:38,317 --> 00:28:42,321
There is a kid with drive.

491
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:46,192
That is the kid I should be
representing, not some... some...

492
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:50,362
Some... fruit in a funny suit.

493
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:53,665
I am not a fruit.

494
00:28:53,766 --> 00:28:55,968
I'm a vegetable.

495
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:58,070
Besides, you want
the hall monitor?

496
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:00,706
You can't handle the
murderer too, silly boy.

497
00:29:00,807 --> 00:29:03,910
They'd kill each other.

498
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:05,411
Now that is the first
intelligent thing

499
00:29:05,511 --> 00:29:08,547
You've said all day.

500
00:29:08,647 --> 00:29:14,186
Football killer versus the
hall monitor... students

501
00:29:14,286 --> 00:29:17,089
Would pay to see that assembly.

502
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:20,359
Oh, supposed you do get
this killer, how are you

503
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:21,727
Going to get the hall monitor?

504
00:29:21,828 --> 00:29:24,831
He won't even talk to you.

505
00:29:24,931 --> 00:29:29,168
That's all being taken
care of right now.

506
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:34,073
I'm making him an offer he
can't refuse, heh-heh-heh-heh.

507
00:29:34,173 --> 00:29:34,874
What?

508
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:01,367
My, oh, my, I seem to
be aimlessly wandering

509
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:04,603
The halls without a hall pass.

510
00:30:04,703 --> 00:30:07,573
I hope that big bad hall
monitor doesn't catch me.

511
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:14,246
Oh, what do I have here?

512
00:30:14,346 --> 00:30:16,248
A stick of gum.

513
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:18,317
Everyone knows you're not
supposed to chew gum in school.

514
00:30:27,894 --> 00:30:28,827
Where is he?

515
00:31:56,382 --> 00:31:59,785
[Metal clanging]

516
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:11,230
[Knocking]

517
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:13,532
What?

518
00:32:13,632 --> 00:32:14,333
Where is everybody?

519
00:32:17,503 --> 00:32:18,304
Somewhere else.

520
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:24,977
[Knocking]

521
00:32:25,077 --> 00:32:28,347
Oh, surprise, it's you again.

522
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:30,782
Where did they go?

523
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:33,752
Not exactly an honor
student, are we?

524
00:32:33,852 --> 00:32:37,523
They went to the high school,
something about beating down

525
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:40,526
The oppressors by using their
own bloody discrimination

526
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:45,131
Against them, not that
I was paying attention.

527
00:32:45,231 --> 00:32:47,333
What do you do back there?

528
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:49,568
Just working on a
plan to forever change

529
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:52,471
The face of this
institution for the better,

530
00:32:52,571 --> 00:32:57,909
Merely using my genius to
improve the lives of my peers.

531
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:59,845
Nothing important.

532
00:32:59,945 --> 00:33:04,016
Hm, sounds boring.

533
00:33:04,116 --> 00:33:04,816
Ugh.

534
00:33:24,536 --> 00:33:26,672
Freeze, Vo-Tech scum.

535
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:34,780
All right, I need to see it.

536
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,286
What's so funny, ass hole?

537
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:55,234
All right, I better be seeing
six more hall passes real soon.

538
00:33:55,334 --> 00:33:58,604
[Elevator ding]

539
00:34:01,607 --> 00:34:03,509
You're going to have a
hard time collecting hall

540
00:34:03,609 --> 00:34:05,144
Passes with two broken arms.

541
00:34:10,416 --> 00:34:14,820
Hm, how's the leg?

542
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,188
Mockery.

543
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:19,125
Get his gun and give it to me.

544
00:34:19,225 --> 00:34:23,129
You think you're
so goddamn tough.

545
00:34:23,229 --> 00:34:24,330
Well, you're not, see?

546
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:25,497
I'm not a high school pussy.

547
00:34:25,597 --> 00:34:27,065
I'm from the Vo-Tech.

548
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:30,269
You can shoot me and I'll be
back the next day, pissed off

549
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:34,140
And still with a perfect
attendance record.

550
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,874
No... no gun.

551
00:34:35,974 --> 00:34:37,008
What?

552
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:39,278
I searched him myself,
he doesn't have a fun.

553
00:34:39,378 --> 00:34:40,646
It's too easy.

554
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:41,447
Hold him.

555
00:34:45,151 --> 00:34:48,187
You think you're so
cool, with your sports

556
00:34:48,287 --> 00:34:50,021
And your cheerleading?

557
00:34:50,122 --> 00:34:53,859
Well, we don't have football
or sex in the Vo-Tech.

558
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:55,861
It's time to feel our pain.

559
00:35:01,133 --> 00:35:03,835
What the Sam Hill's
going on here?

560
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,505
Crazy kids.

561
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:09,007
Get that old fuck.

562
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:13,412
What the... oh, shit.

563
00:35:13,512 --> 00:35:16,014
Call Bessie, crazy kids.

564
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:19,418
Going back to the
elementary school.

565
00:35:19,518 --> 00:35:20,852
Ah.

566
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,689
Oh, my good leg.

567
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:24,923
Kill that prick.

568
00:35:29,027 --> 00:35:31,863
Super.

569
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:35,167
Humph, stand in
the hallway, babe.

570
00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:38,136
Where the skimpy red
thing, sweetheart.

571
00:35:38,237 --> 00:35:39,305
Kiss my ass, Maury.

572
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,543
Good morning, Ms. Wendy.

573
00:36:09,868 --> 00:36:13,171
[Screaming]

574
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,581
Hey.

575
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:24,049
[Whistling]

576
00:36:24,149 --> 00:36:27,519
[Giggling]

577
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,125
We're done taking
high school shit.

578
00:36:34,226 --> 00:36:35,494
Starting today, we... ah.

579
00:36:46,438 --> 00:36:49,775
[Screaming]

580
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:01,620
[Screaming]

581
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:06,057
Oh.

582
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:07,293
Oh.

583
00:37:07,393 --> 00:37:09,628
Don't move, man, or I
swear I'll take her eye out.

584
00:37:11,997 --> 00:37:12,731
See?

585
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:14,099
That's what I'm talking about.

586
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:15,334
It's all sex, sex, sex.

587
00:37:25,544 --> 00:37:29,815
You are so cool.

588
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:33,151
[Clapping]

589
00:37:37,556 --> 00:37:39,591
Ah, not so fast, tough guy.

590
00:37:44,296 --> 00:37:45,697
I have a hall pass.

591
00:37:48,334 --> 00:37:49,635
I'm not as dumb as you look.

592
00:37:52,838 --> 00:37:56,074
I have every right to be in
this hallway and you know it.

593
00:37:56,174 --> 00:37:59,778
You got nothing on me.

594
00:37:59,878 --> 00:38:01,780
You two make me sick.

595
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:06,485
The most popular kids in
school... sex and violence.

596
00:38:06,585 --> 00:38:07,986
[Screaming]

597
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:09,054
You don't impress me, man.

598
00:38:09,154 --> 00:38:13,792
I'm from the Vo-Tech
and I have a hall pass.

599
00:38:13,892 --> 00:38:19,665
I have a hall... pass.

600
00:38:19,765 --> 00:38:20,466
Ah.

601
00:38:25,937 --> 00:38:26,605
Mockery.

602
00:38:30,709 --> 00:38:33,445
This ain't over, man.

603
00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:34,880
Not by a long shot.

604
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,987
So where do you sit at lunch?

605
00:38:42,087 --> 00:38:46,825
I could save you a seat at
the cool table if you want.

606
00:38:46,925 --> 00:38:48,827
Dan?

607
00:38:48,927 --> 00:38:49,828
We got problems.

608
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:14,753
Suffocated with a cup, ugh.

609
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:17,456
I hope I never go that way.

610
00:39:17,556 --> 00:39:18,390
Anybody see anything?

611
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:23,128
It's the library, Dan.

612
00:39:23,228 --> 00:39:24,029
Nobody ever comes in here.

613
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:34,339
"To the guy I beat
up after school, KIT."

614
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,308
Mitch the Oven, hm.

615
00:39:37,409 --> 00:39:39,545
I know, it doesn't
do us any good.

616
00:39:39,645 --> 00:39:44,483
Mitch beat up half the
student body last year.

617
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:45,283
Could be anybody.

618
00:39:51,623 --> 00:39:54,092
The superintendent's not happy.

619
00:39:54,192 --> 00:39:55,093
There's a big game tonight.

620
00:39:57,929 --> 00:39:59,097
If I had my gun...

621
00:39:59,197 --> 00:40:02,100
And then we'd have seven
innocent people dead.

622
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,536
I have a hard enough time
trying to explain why

623
00:40:04,636 --> 00:40:07,439
You beat up the entire Vo-Tech.

624
00:40:07,539 --> 00:40:10,341
And by the way, the, um, wood
shop teacher says thanks.

625
00:40:16,281 --> 00:40:18,650
There's one left.

626
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:19,751
One what?

627
00:40:19,851 --> 00:40:20,719
One Vo-Tech student.

628
00:40:20,819 --> 00:40:22,688
And we're going to
keep it that way.

629
00:40:22,788 --> 00:40:27,058
Now from this point on, you
will follow no more leads.

630
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:29,661
I want you to stick
with the football team.

631
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:31,129
Do not let them
out of your sight.

632
00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:33,164
I am serious, Dan.

633
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,766
The superintendent is furious.

634
00:40:34,866 --> 00:40:37,903
He is talking about
reinstating morning prayer

635
00:40:38,003 --> 00:40:40,171
Because of this violence.

636
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:43,408
God help us all.

637
00:40:43,509 --> 00:40:46,277
This is Lucy McGregor reporting
from the school cafeteria

638
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:48,413
On was has become a sad
day for the students

639
00:40:48,514 --> 00:40:49,781
At Rocky Mountain High.

640
00:40:49,881 --> 00:40:54,986
Two of our most popular, beloved
students taken in their prime.

641
00:40:55,086 --> 00:40:57,188
I didn't really know
any of the victims.

642
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,657
I'm on the chess team.

643
00:40:58,757 --> 00:41:00,526
I would just like
to say that we exist

644
00:41:00,626 --> 00:41:04,095
In a school of many people.

645
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:05,697
Oh.

646
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:09,167
Popular, unpopular.

647
00:41:09,267 --> 00:41:10,502
Lucy.

648
00:41:10,602 --> 00:41:12,938
Athletic, non-athletic.

649
00:41:13,038 --> 00:41:15,507
I'm devastated
that my friends are

650
00:41:15,607 --> 00:41:19,144
Now walking the hallways of
that great big high school

651
00:41:19,244 --> 00:41:20,278
In the sky.

652
00:41:20,378 --> 00:41:22,548
People of many different
beliefs and interests.

653
00:41:22,648 --> 00:41:24,215
I'm not a football player.

654
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,552
Like I said, I'm
on the chess team.

655
00:41:26,652 --> 00:41:28,286
And I think it's a
sin that one should

656
00:41:28,386 --> 00:41:32,323
Be punished for simply belonging
to one of these groups.

657
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:34,726
That's right, I'm
on the chess team.

658
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,027
You all made fun of me.

659
00:41:36,127 --> 00:41:38,764
You beat me up after school
and stole my lunch money.

660
00:41:38,864 --> 00:41:41,833
You all laughed at me, but
who's laughing now, dead boys?

661
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:43,501
So you think it's
wrong that these two

662
00:41:43,602 --> 00:41:45,537
Victims were murdered
simply because they're

663
00:41:45,637 --> 00:41:46,905
Football players?

664
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:50,609
No, I think it's wrong that
this is considered a vegetarian

665
00:41:50,709 --> 00:41:52,410
Substitute for meatloaf.

666
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,245
I'm on the chess team.

667
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,081
I'm on the chess team.

668
00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:02,287
Is this 20 OK?

669
00:42:02,387 --> 00:42:03,822
Are there any
words of comfort you

670
00:42:03,922 --> 00:42:07,258
Can offer those who are
closest to the deceased?

671
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,696
My advise is don't fret,
that causes crinkles.

672
00:42:10,796 --> 00:42:14,332
Why wear your pain
on your face when

673
00:42:14,432 --> 00:42:18,303
You can wear it on your body?

674
00:42:18,403 --> 00:42:22,507
For only 19.99, you can show
the world that you're mourning

675
00:42:22,608 --> 00:42:24,910
And still look good for
your senior picture.

676
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:25,877
That is it.

677
00:42:25,977 --> 00:42:27,646
He's not allowed
on camera any more.

678
00:42:27,746 --> 00:42:29,581
He's ruining my
documentary, I just...

679
00:42:29,681 --> 00:42:31,917
Order now and receive
this free gift.

680
00:42:32,017 --> 00:42:33,251
Shut up.

681
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:35,520
Turn that off.

682
00:42:35,621 --> 00:42:36,788
I'm sure the
victims would agree

683
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:38,423
With me, if they weren't dead.

684
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:53,271
Jonathan, who do you think
the killer is... a football

685
00:42:53,371 --> 00:42:55,473
Player from a
rival school, maybe

686
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:58,043
A disgruntled ex-cheerleader?

687
00:42:58,143 --> 00:43:00,545
The identity of the killer
isn't important, Lucy.

688
00:43:00,646 --> 00:43:02,347
What is important
is that the team

689
00:43:02,447 --> 00:43:04,215
Hasn't lost its school spirit.

690
00:43:04,315 --> 00:43:08,153
We are all still infected by
the raging Rocky Mountain fever

691
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:13,458
And that fever is guiding and
protecting us even as I speak.

692
00:43:13,558 --> 00:43:14,926
How so?

693
00:43:15,026 --> 00:43:18,163
We've been given
a guardian angel.

694
00:43:18,263 --> 00:43:20,966
Dan, are you personally
protecting the football team?

695
00:43:25,136 --> 00:43:27,939
I've seen the sort of thing
that's going today before.

696
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:31,777
And let me tell you, the
scum that's doing this

697
00:43:31,877 --> 00:43:35,613
Is cold, relentless,
and consistent.

698
00:43:35,714 --> 00:43:38,216
He's not going to stop until
everybody at this table

699
00:43:38,316 --> 00:43:39,517
Is dead.

700
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:43,655
Well, I say here they are,
dirt bag, come and get 'em.

701
00:43:43,755 --> 00:43:45,791
I'll be here waiting.

702
00:43:45,891 --> 00:43:48,660
And I don't care if everyone
in this school has to die.

703
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,196
I'm going to catch this
son of a bitch in the end

704
00:43:51,296 --> 00:43:54,332
And then I'm going
to take him down.

705
00:43:54,432 --> 00:43:55,934
You hear me, asshole?

706
00:43:56,034 --> 00:43:57,602
You're going down.

707
00:43:57,703 --> 00:43:59,004
I'm not afraid of you.

708
00:43:59,104 --> 00:44:01,873
Kill 'em all, I won't back down.

709
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:04,976
You're mine.

710
00:44:05,076 --> 00:44:07,846
Mine.

711
00:44:07,946 --> 00:44:09,280
[Laughter]

712
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,716
WENDY: Isn't he the most?

713
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:20,692
This... this is Lucy
McGregor signing off.

714
00:44:29,868 --> 00:44:33,204
You shouldn't eat that shit.

715
00:44:33,304 --> 00:44:34,572
It's bad for the skin.

716
00:44:38,043 --> 00:44:39,845
What do you want, Williams?

717
00:44:39,945 --> 00:44:44,015
Your job, but I'd settled
for the hall monitor.

718
00:44:44,115 --> 00:44:46,818
[Laughter]

719
00:44:46,918 --> 00:44:49,788
Yeah, the hall monitor,
that's a good one.

720
00:44:49,888 --> 00:44:51,923
Mhm, what are you going to do?

721
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:53,491
Get him elected class president?

722
00:44:58,229 --> 00:45:01,699
Hall monitor doesn't
care for your, uh, world.

723
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,635
That's why he's so effective.

724
00:45:04,736 --> 00:45:09,507
Popularity, girls, doesn't
mean a thing to that kid.

725
00:45:09,607 --> 00:45:12,343
What could you give him
that he doesn't have?

726
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:13,244
A gun.

727
00:45:20,218 --> 00:45:25,290
Come on, Marty, you know
it's the right thing to do.

728
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:28,626
Look, I was, um, only following
the superintendent's orders,

729
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:29,995
All right?

730
00:45:30,095 --> 00:45:33,264
Oh, please, spare me
the good soldier routine.

731
00:45:33,364 --> 00:45:36,634
Besides, I mean, really,
what's one or two

732
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,770
Dead innocent
bystanders compared

733
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:43,408
To a big win in tonight's game?

734
00:45:43,508 --> 00:45:47,745
Marty, Marty, I only came to
you because you're the one

735
00:45:47,846 --> 00:45:51,783
Person that this kid trusts.

736
00:45:51,883 --> 00:45:59,490
Mark my words, if I have to
do this without you, I will.

737
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:05,130
You know, I always
liked this office.

738
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:08,766
What would you think
about shag carpeting?

739
00:46:08,867 --> 00:46:11,702
You get the hell
out of my office.

740
00:46:11,803 --> 00:46:14,305
Oh, no, you keep it.

741
00:46:14,405 --> 00:46:16,842
You're going to need
something to cry into.

742
00:46:16,942 --> 00:46:19,377
Oh-ho, ciao, baby.

743
00:46:38,096 --> 00:46:41,466
[Groaning]

744
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,840
I'm going to start
killing them myself.

745
00:47:08,226 --> 00:47:12,097
[Glass breaking]

746
00:47:25,076 --> 00:47:27,045
I appreciate this, Dan.

747
00:47:27,145 --> 00:47:29,214
My entire offensive
line's in this class.

748
00:47:29,314 --> 00:47:32,583
Big game coming up tonight,
can't be too careful.

749
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:36,087
Let's get one thing straight.

750
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:39,257
I hate football.

751
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:44,295
I'm only here to catch
this scum in the act.

752
00:47:44,395 --> 00:47:45,263
Think fast.

753
00:47:59,277 --> 00:48:00,645
Excuse me.

754
00:48:00,745 --> 00:48:04,115
[Chuckle]

755
00:48:24,069 --> 00:48:28,139
You know, we got a couple
openings on the team,

756
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:28,940
If you're interested.

757
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:39,384
Hey, idiot, go long.

758
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,829
Don't just stand there, idiot.

759
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:52,797
Go get it.

760
00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:01,272
Oh, I'm going to start
making him wear a helmet.

761
00:49:01,372 --> 00:49:02,073
Jesus.

762
00:49:06,044 --> 00:49:06,744
Football?

763
00:49:09,847 --> 00:49:10,548
Football?

764
00:49:18,656 --> 00:49:21,526
Football.

765
00:49:21,626 --> 00:49:24,229
[Deep breathing]

766
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:42,280
Ow.

767
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:45,016
Stay where I can
see you, moron.

768
00:49:45,116 --> 00:49:45,816
Idiot.

769
00:49:49,154 --> 00:49:50,555
What?

770
00:49:50,655 --> 00:49:52,257
It's idiot, not moron.

771
00:50:18,983 --> 00:50:20,951
Yeah, uh-huh.

772
00:50:21,052 --> 00:50:25,090
Well, you know, actually, I...
I have some ideas of my own.

773
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:27,792
And the one that's going
to be put into operation

774
00:50:27,892 --> 00:50:29,627
Almost any minute now.

775
00:50:29,727 --> 00:50:30,895
Uh-huh.

776
00:50:30,995 --> 00:50:33,098
OK, well, listen, I...
I've got to run, sir.

777
00:50:33,198 --> 00:50:36,134
Ciao, love you.

778
00:50:36,234 --> 00:50:37,968
Asshole.

779
00:50:38,069 --> 00:50:42,273
Father John, how's life
in the school of the Lord?

780
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:44,809
Fine, fine, good to see
you're still doing so well, eh?

781
00:50:44,909 --> 00:50:45,676
What can I say?

782
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:46,577
Jesus loves me.

783
00:50:46,677 --> 00:50:49,247
Yeah, apparently so.

784
00:50:49,347 --> 00:50:51,882
He comes bearing gift, sir.

785
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:54,352
Oh, ho-ho, ho-ho, ho-ho.

786
00:50:54,452 --> 00:50:56,854
How many Hail Marys is
this going to sit me back?

787
00:50:56,954 --> 00:50:58,323
Oh, think nothing of it.

788
00:50:58,423 --> 00:51:00,458
There's simply no place
for weapons of the devil

789
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:02,393
At the Saint Teresa High.

790
00:51:02,493 --> 00:51:04,529
Besides, nowhere
in the Bible does

791
00:51:04,629 --> 00:51:07,965
It say thou shalt not perform
unauthorized locker searches,

792
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:09,400
Eh?

793
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,802
And you are a true
man of the Lord.

794
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:12,870
Grazie, signore.

795
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:13,938
Oh, prego.

796
00:51:14,038 --> 00:51:16,174
[Laughter]

797
00:51:16,274 --> 00:51:17,242
Maurice, I got it.

798
00:51:17,342 --> 00:51:20,345
I'm a genius.

799
00:51:20,445 --> 00:51:21,212
I'll come back later.

800
00:51:25,015 --> 00:51:25,983
What can I say?

801
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,518
Public schools.

802
00:51:27,618 --> 00:51:28,319
He's a carrot.

803
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:31,322
He's one of my clients.

804
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:32,657
[Bell ringing]

805
00:51:32,757 --> 00:51:34,859
Something's seriously
wrong in this school, Dan.

806
00:51:34,959 --> 00:51:36,661
Number seven, nice hustle.

807
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:39,897
I mean, whoever this kid is,
he took off two of my meanest,

808
00:51:39,997 --> 00:51:41,699
Toughest players.

809
00:51:41,799 --> 00:51:43,901
Hey, big number
eight, way to go, huh?

810
00:51:44,001 --> 00:51:46,771
I mean, why a bad ass like
that is wondering these halls

811
00:51:46,871 --> 00:51:48,739
And not on my team is beyond me.

812
00:51:53,711 --> 00:51:56,414
Ritchie, we forget something?

813
00:51:59,284 --> 00:51:59,984
What?

814
00:52:00,084 --> 00:52:01,118
I showered.

815
00:52:01,219 --> 00:52:03,854
Get in there and cover
that... that thing up.

816
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:04,655
Oh.

817
00:52:09,227 --> 00:52:10,461
Idiot, idiot.

818
00:52:14,165 --> 00:52:15,700
Danny boy, hey, kid.

819
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:16,634
Come here.

820
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:24,875
Remember when I told you
that I understood you, that I

821
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:26,811
Could handle your vision?

822
00:52:26,911 --> 00:52:27,778
Don't answer.

823
00:52:27,878 --> 00:52:30,248
You can thank me later.

824
00:52:30,348 --> 00:52:33,751
Look, I'm sorry I didn't
come to your office.

825
00:52:33,851 --> 00:52:36,487
Jesus, it's been a busy day.

826
00:52:36,587 --> 00:52:39,357
No, no, it's for you.

827
00:52:39,457 --> 00:52:42,460
Kid, it's... it's a gift.

828
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:45,763
It's a gift, yours to
keep, if you'll let

829
00:52:45,863 --> 00:52:46,897
Me be your guidance counselor.

830
00:52:53,971 --> 00:52:57,342
[Thumping]

831
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:16,227
What are you doing in there?

832
00:53:16,327 --> 00:53:19,697
Restoring my school to the
values it was founded upon.

833
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:29,874
No, really, what are you doing?

834
00:53:34,445 --> 00:53:37,382
You come with me, you get
the gun and the freedom

835
00:53:37,482 --> 00:53:39,550
To use it however you see fit.

836
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:42,687
And what do you get?

837
00:53:42,787 --> 00:53:44,054
Me?

838
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:46,991
Well, I... I get
the peace of mind

839
00:53:47,091 --> 00:53:50,094
Knowing that our
school is once again

840
00:53:50,194 --> 00:53:51,696
Protected by the
baddest son of a bitch

841
00:53:51,796 --> 00:53:53,698
To ever walk these halls.

842
00:53:53,798 --> 00:53:55,400
Of course, when you
catch the little psycho,

843
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,802
You're going to
have to, you know,

844
00:53:57,902 --> 00:53:59,370
Kill 'em in front of
the entire school,

845
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:01,872
But I'll be standing
right by your side.

846
00:54:05,142 --> 00:54:06,911
What do you think?

847
00:54:07,011 --> 00:54:13,318
After a display like that,
you could become a hero.

848
00:54:13,418 --> 00:54:17,755
And I could become principal.

849
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:18,556
Hm?

850
00:54:23,828 --> 00:54:24,695
I gotta get to class.

851
00:54:27,432 --> 00:54:30,034
Damn, kid.

852
00:54:30,134 --> 00:54:31,902
What does he want?

853
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:32,870
[Crash]

854
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:35,706
What the hell?

855
00:54:35,806 --> 00:54:36,474
RITCHIE: What are you...

856
00:54:36,574 --> 00:54:37,475
[Crash]

857
00:54:37,575 --> 00:54:38,275
Ow.

858
00:54:42,547 --> 00:54:43,414
Ouch, ouch.

859
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:56,327
So let me get this straight.

860
00:54:56,427 --> 00:54:59,464
You've poisoned the mouthpieces
so that the entire football

861
00:54:59,564 --> 00:55:01,332
Team will die.

862
00:55:01,432 --> 00:55:03,401
And?

863
00:55:03,501 --> 00:55:07,204
And by murdering the barbitua...

864
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:09,206
Perpetuators.

865
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:11,976
Perpetuators of
lies and violence,

866
00:55:12,076 --> 00:55:15,145
The school will once again
be forced to shift focus

867
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:19,684
To education and social reform.

868
00:55:19,784 --> 00:55:22,420
That's it.

869
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:23,220
Oh.

870
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:40,371
The one person
that understood me.

871
00:55:40,471 --> 00:55:42,239
[Sigh]

872
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:43,040
Freeze.

873
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:46,944
Oh.

874
00:55:47,044 --> 00:55:50,915
So it seems you've caught me.

875
00:55:51,015 --> 00:55:53,584
Well, before you take me in, I'm
sure there are just a million

876
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:57,722
Questions you'd like to ask
me, like why did I do it, what

877
00:55:57,822 --> 00:56:00,858
Drives such a brilliant
criminal mind,

878
00:56:00,958 --> 00:56:04,395
Did my mom dress
me up like a girl.

879
00:56:04,495 --> 00:56:06,030
Well, go ahead and
ask me a question

880
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:09,534
And I'll pretend
to be interested.

881
00:56:09,634 --> 00:56:11,301
How would you like
to come to my office

882
00:56:11,402 --> 00:56:15,440
And discuss how the most
popular kid in school

883
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:16,306
Should be treated?

884
00:56:21,011 --> 00:56:22,112
Spectacular.

885
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,181
I can't believe that
they're dropping like flies,

886
00:56:24,281 --> 00:56:26,216
Stupid steroid pumping flies.

887
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:29,319
I'm going to have a scholarship
before sixth period.

888
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:30,455
Let's get 'em.

889
00:56:34,692 --> 00:56:36,160
It's going to be written
in the history books

890
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:39,096
As one of the most brilliant
crimes of the century.

891
00:56:39,196 --> 00:56:41,098
The football killer rocks.

892
00:56:41,198 --> 00:56:44,869
The so-called football
killer has sent waves of shock

893
00:56:44,969 --> 00:56:47,004
To the entire student body.

894
00:56:47,104 --> 00:56:50,374
A scared and baffled faculty is
beginning to accuse Principal

895
00:56:50,475 --> 00:56:51,742
Martin Caste of incompetence.

896
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:57,882
Principal Caste, how
are you responding

897
00:56:57,982 --> 00:57:00,951
To accusations that you're not
qualified to run this school?

898
00:57:01,051 --> 00:57:05,790
Lucy, heh-heh, this is
a small suburban school

899
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:07,525
With a limited budget.

900
00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:10,695
There's just, uh, so
much that you can do

901
00:57:10,795 --> 00:57:14,899
And I want to assure everyone
that I am doing as best I can.

902
00:57:14,999 --> 00:57:17,234
How are you handling
the hall monitor's

903
00:57:17,334 --> 00:57:19,236
Inability to perform his duty?

904
00:57:19,336 --> 00:57:20,137
Listen, you little bitch...

905
00:57:20,237 --> 00:57:22,507
Because of the
present situation,

906
00:57:22,607 --> 00:57:26,877
Daniel Kashwood has been
removed of... from this case.

907
00:57:26,977 --> 00:57:28,513
What?

908
00:57:28,613 --> 00:57:29,980
I had to.

909
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,483
I'm following my orders.

910
00:57:32,583 --> 00:57:34,752
Dan, what's it going
to be like returning

911
00:57:34,852 --> 00:57:35,920
To normal school life and...

912
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:37,387
I told you once today.

913
00:57:37,488 --> 00:57:39,724
Stick that thing
some place else.

914
00:57:39,824 --> 00:57:41,258
What the hell's
going on here, Marty?

915
00:57:41,358 --> 00:57:44,328
Luke, we'll talk later, hm?

916
00:57:44,428 --> 00:57:46,030
But Dan...

917
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:48,766
Uh, Dan... I'm sorry, kid.

918
00:57:48,866 --> 00:57:49,734
It's over.

919
00:57:49,834 --> 00:57:51,435
The hell it is.

920
00:57:51,536 --> 00:57:53,070
Dan, what's it going
to be like returning

921
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:57,775
To normal school life... ah,
Dan, that's school property.

922
00:58:38,015 --> 00:58:39,817
I don't care what you have
to say publicly, Marty,

923
00:58:39,917 --> 00:58:41,886
But you can't take
me off this case.

924
00:58:41,986 --> 00:58:42,687
Sorry, I have to.

925
00:58:42,787 --> 00:58:44,722
No, no.

926
00:58:44,822 --> 00:58:46,056
You don't.

927
00:58:46,156 --> 00:58:47,758
Look, you think I
have control here?

928
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:48,559
I don't.

929
00:58:51,596 --> 00:58:54,932
I have known you since
elementary school.

930
00:58:55,032 --> 00:58:56,934
Don't you think I'd do
something if I could?

931
00:58:59,904 --> 00:59:04,208
Look, you know me
better than anybody.

932
00:59:04,308 --> 00:59:07,111
You know this is all I've got.

933
00:59:07,211 --> 00:59:10,514
It's everything.

934
00:59:10,615 --> 00:59:13,951
This job, it's my
whole identity.

935
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:17,955
I mean, you can't take away
a teen's identity, right?

936
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:21,759
I mean, that'll mess
him up for life, right?

937
00:59:21,859 --> 00:59:25,162
I am just the principal here.

938
00:59:25,262 --> 00:59:29,266
I... I don't write
the curriculum,

939
00:59:29,366 --> 00:59:33,604
I don't decide the snow days.

940
00:59:33,704 --> 00:59:35,072
I don't run this school.

941
01:00:13,911 --> 01:00:14,611
Impressed?

942
01:00:17,581 --> 01:00:19,483
You start at this all day?

943
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:22,086
I'm impressed you
don't get hazard pay.

944
01:00:22,186 --> 01:00:26,857
These are the most popular
students this school ever had.

945
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:36,801
Everyone a legend and everyone
counselled by yours truly.

946
01:00:36,901 --> 01:00:42,372
You play your cards right, I
put your picture at the top.

947
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:45,776
Please, do I get to
wear the funny suit?

948
01:00:45,876 --> 01:00:49,646
Babe, you do realize
that students beg me

949
01:00:49,747 --> 01:00:51,849
To be their guidance counselor.

950
01:00:51,949 --> 01:00:54,618
Don't take this
the wrong way, babe,

951
01:00:54,719 --> 01:00:57,354
But after I was done
with the football team,

952
01:00:57,454 --> 01:01:00,290
I was going to kill you.

953
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:01,625
Why?

954
01:01:01,726 --> 01:01:04,394
Well, look at you,
you're sleaze personified.

955
01:01:09,066 --> 01:01:10,167
And?

956
01:01:10,267 --> 01:01:13,971
And you're ruining my school.

957
01:01:14,071 --> 01:01:15,973
You've taken the
passive ideology

958
01:01:16,073 --> 01:01:17,607
Of institutional
learning and turned

959
01:01:17,708 --> 01:01:20,010
It into a violent
class struggle,

960
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:23,413
A bloody popularity contest.

961
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:27,617
Every student in this school has
forsaken education for status,

962
01:01:27,718 --> 01:01:30,788
Traded ethics for self image.

963
01:01:30,888 --> 01:01:34,024
You know, last year,
20 people signed

964
01:01:34,124 --> 01:01:37,694
My yearbook keep in
touch and not one of them

965
01:01:37,795 --> 01:01:39,196
Returned my phone calls.

966
01:01:39,296 --> 01:01:42,733
And do you know why?

967
01:01:42,833 --> 01:01:45,635
Because they didn't
want to keep in touch.

968
01:01:45,736 --> 01:01:50,374
They just wanted to write
what everybody else wrote.

969
01:01:50,474 --> 01:01:55,612
They didn't care about my
feelings, only their image.

970
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:58,548
Well, there's a price to be paid
for living without a conscience

971
01:01:58,648 --> 01:02:00,150
And it's high time it was paid.

972
01:02:03,821 --> 01:02:06,156
You want to be on the
student council, don't you?

973
01:02:06,256 --> 01:02:07,457
What?

974
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:11,796
You need an outlet for
these ideas of yours.

975
01:02:11,896 --> 01:02:14,698
A column in the school paper.

976
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:17,267
Have you noticed the
unusually high number

977
01:02:17,367 --> 01:02:19,303
Of dead bodies lying around?

978
01:02:19,403 --> 01:02:22,506
I have an outlet for my ideas.

979
01:02:22,606 --> 01:02:27,711
You know that, I know
that, but nobody else does.

980
01:02:27,812 --> 01:02:30,881
You see, on some deeper
level of understanding,

981
01:02:30,981 --> 01:02:34,852
Dead jocks may symbolize
retribution for your pain

982
01:02:34,952 --> 01:02:35,853
And your suffering.

983
01:02:35,953 --> 01:02:39,356
But baby, this is a high school.

984
01:02:39,456 --> 01:02:42,793
You're coming off like a bully.

985
01:02:42,893 --> 01:02:45,262
Really?

986
01:02:45,362 --> 01:02:47,631
[Knocking]

987
01:02:47,731 --> 01:02:48,432
Hold that thought.

988
01:02:56,406 --> 01:02:57,107
Ooh.

989
01:03:00,177 --> 01:03:05,049
Oh, hey, babe, how's
the investigation?

990
01:03:05,149 --> 01:03:07,384
I got fired.

991
01:03:07,484 --> 01:03:08,385
No.

992
01:03:08,485 --> 01:03:09,419
Yeah.

993
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:12,656
Look, do you still
want to make a deal?

994
01:03:12,756 --> 01:03:13,991
Do I want to make a deal?

995
01:03:14,091 --> 01:03:16,260
Does a cheerleader big tits?

996
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:17,561
Yes.

997
01:03:17,661 --> 01:03:18,929
OK, then.

998
01:03:19,029 --> 01:03:21,665
You give me the gun, and I'll
give you whatever you want.

999
01:03:21,765 --> 01:03:24,168
Well, you know what I want.

1000
01:03:24,268 --> 01:03:25,202
You got it.

1001
01:03:25,302 --> 01:03:26,803
OK, in front of the
whole school now.

1002
01:03:26,904 --> 01:03:28,505
No popping him in the hallway.

1003
01:03:28,605 --> 01:03:30,040
I know how you are.

1004
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:33,844
Anything, I just want the gun.

1005
01:03:33,944 --> 01:03:37,414
I'll give you
more than the gun.

1006
01:03:37,514 --> 01:03:41,551
I'll give you...

1007
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:47,357
I'll be back in
about one minute.

1008
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:53,497
Oh, good, you found the gun.

1009
01:03:53,597 --> 01:03:55,632
In the fickle land
of lies, truth must

1010
01:03:55,732 --> 01:03:57,968
Be maintained through force.

1011
01:03:58,068 --> 01:04:00,704
You want a bigger one?

1012
01:04:00,804 --> 01:04:01,972
Who's out there?

1013
01:04:02,072 --> 01:04:02,772
Where?

1014
01:04:05,009 --> 01:04:09,346
Oh, there, that's... my mom.

1015
01:04:09,446 --> 01:04:14,751
Listen, if... if you want the
school to understand the genius

1016
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:18,388
Of what you're doing, we've got
to explain it to them in a way

1017
01:04:18,488 --> 01:04:19,456
That they can understand.

1018
01:04:19,556 --> 01:04:21,926
[Knocking]

1019
01:04:22,026 --> 01:04:24,861
DAN: Williams.

1020
01:04:24,962 --> 01:04:25,795
Mother a baritone?

1021
01:04:29,666 --> 01:04:31,969
Throat cancer.

1022
01:04:32,069 --> 01:04:34,871
[Inaudible]

1023
01:04:34,972 --> 01:04:35,772
I'll be right back.

1024
01:04:40,477 --> 01:04:43,113
Uh, sweetheart, settle.

1025
01:04:43,213 --> 01:04:44,814
I didn't forget about you.

1026
01:04:44,915 --> 01:04:46,583
Give me the gun.

1027
01:04:46,683 --> 01:04:49,186
The gun, yeah, right.

1028
01:04:49,286 --> 01:04:53,523
See, about that, I
can't do it, kid.

1029
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:54,724
But you said...

1030
01:04:54,824 --> 01:04:56,526
Well, that was last
period, wasn't it?

1031
01:04:56,626 --> 01:04:58,162
You see, now, if I
remember correctly,

1032
01:04:58,262 --> 01:05:00,364
It was your decision
not to take it.

1033
01:05:00,464 --> 01:05:03,934
Yeah, well, I had my head
up my ass last period, OK?

1034
01:05:04,034 --> 01:05:05,635
Look, you were right.

1035
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:08,572
Now just give me the piece and
everybody gets what they want.

1036
01:05:08,672 --> 01:05:11,808
Well, I... really, really,
I would like to do that,

1037
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:16,613
But truth is I haven't got it.

1038
01:05:16,713 --> 01:05:19,449
[Gunshot]

1039
01:05:19,549 --> 01:05:20,985
Then what was that?

1040
01:05:21,085 --> 01:05:22,652
Car backfiring.

1041
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:24,754
In your office?

1042
01:05:24,854 --> 01:05:25,555
I drive a Yugo.

1043
01:05:28,993 --> 01:05:31,561
I don't know what you're
trying to pull here, Williams.

1044
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:33,998
But gun or not, I'm
going to get this guy,

1045
01:05:34,098 --> 01:05:37,367
And then I'm coming after you.

1046
01:05:37,467 --> 01:05:38,735
Oh, hey, kid, come on.

1047
01:05:38,835 --> 01:05:40,304
It doesn't have to be like this.

1048
01:05:40,404 --> 01:05:43,673
I'm on your side.

1049
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:46,276
I don't need anyone on my side.

1050
01:05:46,376 --> 01:05:48,979
I don't need the principal
and I don't need you.

1051
01:05:49,079 --> 01:05:53,883
I only need two things... a gun
and a psychopath to use it on.

1052
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:15,972
I never fired one before.

1053
01:06:16,073 --> 01:06:19,976
Kinda cool, huh?

1054
01:06:20,077 --> 01:06:22,712
Crazy, look, if we're going
to get your idea across,

1055
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:26,750
We'd better do it now
while you're still hot.

1056
01:06:26,850 --> 01:06:30,920
I can give you the entire
student body in one room

1057
01:06:31,021 --> 01:06:33,990
With nothing to do but listen
to you tell them what fools

1058
01:06:34,091 --> 01:06:37,461
They are on one condition.

1059
01:06:37,561 --> 01:06:39,596
No more football players die.

1060
01:06:39,696 --> 01:06:41,498
You're beginning to piss
off the hall monitor

1061
01:06:41,598 --> 01:06:46,303
And he is the one person
who could ruin all this.

1062
01:06:46,403 --> 01:06:48,705
[Laughter]

1063
01:06:48,805 --> 01:06:51,375
What?

1064
01:06:51,475 --> 01:06:52,876
Let's just say
the hall monitor's

1065
01:06:52,976 --> 01:06:55,245
Going to be plum sore at me.

1066
01:06:58,548 --> 01:07:00,450
Well, what did you expect?

1067
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:02,919
I'm gone, man.

1068
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:03,720
Wacko.

1069
01:07:08,625 --> 01:07:10,627
You girls make me sick.

1070
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:17,867
Just looking at
you pansies makes

1071
01:07:17,967 --> 01:07:22,172
Me want to puke all over your
pretty, pampered, pussy ass

1072
01:07:22,272 --> 01:07:23,440
Faces.

1073
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:27,544
Now, I can tolerate
you failing algebra.

1074
01:07:27,644 --> 01:07:29,246
Algebra.

1075
01:07:29,346 --> 01:07:32,082
I can tolerate you getting your
little girlfriends pregnant.

1076
01:07:32,182 --> 01:07:36,886
Can even tolerate losing
the game every now and then,

1077
01:07:36,986 --> 01:07:39,856
But I will not tolerate
you lying down and letting

1078
01:07:39,956 --> 01:07:41,725
Some punk kill you
off like a bunch

1079
01:07:41,825 --> 01:07:46,096
Of... like a bunch of mama's
boy in the honors society.

1080
01:07:46,196 --> 01:07:50,134
We are the football
team, goddammit.

1081
01:07:50,234 --> 01:07:53,103
And if there's killing
to be done, well, by God,

1082
01:07:53,203 --> 01:07:54,204
We're going to do it.

1083
01:07:54,304 --> 01:07:55,004
Right?

1084
01:07:58,642 --> 01:08:00,177
Sir, if I could?

1085
01:08:00,277 --> 01:08:02,279
Shut up, Johnny.

1086
01:08:02,379 --> 01:08:04,614
Do you hate me?

1087
01:08:04,714 --> 01:08:06,583
Is that it?

1088
01:08:06,683 --> 01:08:08,017
Huh?

1089
01:08:08,118 --> 01:08:11,521
Because if you do,
you'll be happy to know

1090
01:08:11,621 --> 01:08:16,160
That the entire faculty is
laughing behind my back.

1091
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:18,061
Sir, please?

1092
01:08:18,162 --> 01:08:21,365
Do you have something
to say, Johnny?

1093
01:08:21,465 --> 01:08:25,034
I thought we could take a
moment and ask for guidance.

1094
01:08:25,135 --> 01:08:26,636
Have you been talking
to Maurice Williams?

1095
01:08:26,736 --> 01:08:29,506
There's something
funny about that man.

1096
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:35,445
No, no, guidance from above,
from the ultimate source

1097
01:08:35,545 --> 01:08:39,616
Of power and knowledge,
the Rocky Mountain fever.

1098
01:08:39,716 --> 01:08:41,451
Is there something
wrong with you, boy?

1099
01:08:41,551 --> 01:08:44,154
Is your momma a
Southern Baptist?

1100
01:08:44,254 --> 01:08:47,557
We're not talking about
some higher spiritual power.

1101
01:08:47,657 --> 01:08:49,293
We're talking about
the kicking the living

1102
01:08:49,393 --> 01:08:52,596
Fuck out of some shithead that
is making us look like pussies.

1103
01:08:52,696 --> 01:08:54,130
TEAM: Yeah.

1104
01:08:54,231 --> 01:08:57,467
No, no, this is all wrong.

1105
01:08:57,567 --> 01:09:00,404
The fever is about
love, not anger.

1106
01:09:00,504 --> 01:09:04,441
You're disgracing the
fever by giving into anger.

1107
01:09:04,541 --> 01:09:07,143
Who are you going to listen
to... the man who took you

1108
01:09:07,244 --> 01:09:10,447
From prepubescent little wussies
to machines of destruction

1109
01:09:10,547 --> 01:09:13,883
Or, ah, Yoda over there?

1110
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:18,622
Look, whoever comes with
me and obeys the fever

1111
01:09:18,722 --> 01:09:21,858
Will be rewarded
with love, peace,

1112
01:09:21,958 --> 01:09:23,793
And everlasting happiness.

1113
01:09:27,063 --> 01:09:27,764
Let's go.

1114
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:31,701
TEAM: Hurray, John.

1115
01:09:34,304 --> 01:09:35,004
You the man.

1116
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:37,474
[Whistle blowing]

1117
01:09:37,574 --> 01:09:39,409
Free beer.

1118
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:41,411
Free beer for
anybody that stays.

1119
01:09:41,511 --> 01:09:42,412
TEAM: Yeah.

1120
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:43,213
Woo-hoo.

1121
01:09:47,917 --> 01:09:52,656
Well, fine, that's more
everlasting happiness for me.

1122
01:09:52,756 --> 01:09:54,558
All right, team, let's suit up.

1123
01:10:03,433 --> 01:10:06,870
All right, men, here's
what's going to go down.

1124
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:08,705
Defensive and offensive
line, now, you big boys

1125
01:10:08,805 --> 01:10:10,106
Are going to sweep
all the classrooms

1126
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:12,509
From the Vo-Tech, the second
floor to the basement.

1127
01:10:12,609 --> 01:10:15,479
You see anybody look funny,
bring 'em to the cafeteria.

1128
01:10:15,579 --> 01:10:18,014
Special teams, you've
got all the doors

1129
01:10:18,114 --> 01:10:19,416
Leading to the outside.

1130
01:10:19,516 --> 01:10:21,551
Now, the rest of you men, you're
going to be right here with me

1131
01:10:21,651 --> 01:10:22,852
In the cafeteria.

1132
01:10:22,952 --> 01:10:24,688
When everybody's here, we're
going to start kicking ass

1133
01:10:24,788 --> 01:10:26,723
Until somebody confesses
or everybody's dead.

1134
01:10:26,823 --> 01:10:27,524
TEAM: Yeah.

1135
01:10:27,624 --> 01:10:28,992
Go kick some ass.

1136
01:10:32,028 --> 01:10:35,365
[Choking]

1137
01:10:40,870 --> 01:10:43,740
God's sake, you crazies
think you're doing?

1138
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,375
Get up.

1139
01:10:45,475 --> 01:10:47,511
I said get up you
wussy little weaklings.

1140
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:53,583
No one dies around here
until I tell 'em to die.

1141
01:10:53,683 --> 01:10:55,018
That's an order.

1142
01:10:55,118 --> 01:10:56,453
Get up.

1143
01:10:56,553 --> 01:10:59,055
Men, get up.

1144
01:10:59,155 --> 01:11:00,056
Free beer.

1145
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:06,195
We're going to lose
so bad tonight.

1146
01:11:29,586 --> 01:11:31,555
MAURICE (ON PA SYSTEM):
Attention students of Rocky

1147
01:11:31,655 --> 01:11:34,658
Mountain High, I'm pleased
to announce that seventh

1148
01:11:34,758 --> 01:11:36,926
Period has been cancelled.

1149
01:11:37,026 --> 01:11:39,062
All students are hereby
ordered to report

1150
01:11:39,162 --> 01:11:42,666
To the auditorium in a
calm and orderly manner

1151
01:11:42,766 --> 01:11:44,568
For an end of the day assembly.

1152
01:11:44,668 --> 01:11:45,369
Thank you.

1153
01:11:52,442 --> 01:11:55,812
[Crowd chatter]

1154
01:12:01,885 --> 01:12:05,288
[Applause]

1155
01:12:53,269 --> 01:12:55,539
Maurice, what the hell
is going on out there?

1156
01:12:55,639 --> 01:12:58,241
This isn't what I wanted.

1157
01:12:58,341 --> 01:12:59,843
We agreed that this
would be a forum

1158
01:12:59,943 --> 01:13:02,345
For intellectual debate,
not some big high school

1159
01:13:02,446 --> 01:13:03,580
Production.

1160
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:06,850
Hey, babe, this is an
assembly, not speech class.

1161
01:13:06,950 --> 01:13:08,918
You want 'em to fall asleep?

1162
01:13:09,018 --> 01:13:12,021
This isn't what I wanted.

1163
01:13:12,121 --> 01:13:13,457
Staring to get a little old.

1164
01:13:18,361 --> 01:13:21,898
Well, how do I look?

1165
01:13:21,998 --> 01:13:23,633
Delicious.

1166
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:27,637
Absolutely scrumptious.

1167
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:28,805
What do you think, kid?

1168
01:14:22,425 --> 01:14:24,060
Do you have a hall pass, son?

1169
01:14:32,502 --> 01:14:34,370
Just how dumb do you think I am?

1170
01:14:40,777 --> 01:14:42,478
OK, now, you ready, kids?

1171
01:14:42,579 --> 01:14:45,348
Remember, you're
doing this for all

1172
01:14:45,448 --> 01:14:48,284
The students in all the
school districts in America.

1173
01:14:55,759 --> 01:14:58,762
Uh, Wendy?

1174
01:14:58,862 --> 01:15:02,899
When this is all over, you
want to go out or something?

1175
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:03,700
Die, freak.

1176
01:15:07,604 --> 01:15:10,173
Is that thing on?

1177
01:15:10,273 --> 01:15:12,375
I have a feeling this
is going to be big.

1178
01:15:17,881 --> 01:15:20,216
Ladies and gentlemen of
Rocky Mountain High School,

1179
01:15:20,316 --> 01:15:22,619
In preparation for
tonight's big game,

1180
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:25,188
Please give it up for
our football team,

1181
01:15:25,288 --> 01:15:27,090
The Ragin' Rocky Mountain.

1182
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:30,459
[Applause]

1183
01:16:09,899 --> 01:16:14,503
What you see up
here may shock you,

1184
01:16:14,604 --> 01:16:16,439
But I'm here to tell you
that what you don't see

1185
01:16:16,539 --> 01:16:17,641
Is even more shocking.

1186
01:16:21,811 --> 01:16:25,448
Everyone in this
room is living a lie.

1187
01:16:28,284 --> 01:16:32,055
You walk around in a
world where the illusion

1188
01:16:32,155 --> 01:16:35,424
Of self-satisfaction looms heavy
over the truth of self-worth.

1189
01:16:35,524 --> 01:16:37,326
Pretentious.

1190
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:38,795
Sh.

1191
01:16:38,895 --> 01:16:46,435
You laugh at the nerd, you
make fun of the fat girl,

1192
01:16:46,535 --> 01:16:50,106
You shove the geek
into a locker.

1193
01:16:50,206 --> 01:16:55,311
It makes you feel good,
you think it's funny.

1194
01:16:55,411 --> 01:16:58,314
Well, let me tell you I've
seen life from the inside

1195
01:16:58,414 --> 01:17:01,651
Of a locker and it stinks.

1196
01:17:01,751 --> 01:17:05,588
And your laughter prevents
you from seeing the pain

1197
01:17:05,689 --> 01:17:11,394
Of your victim, a pain
which longs for justice,

1198
01:17:11,494 --> 01:17:15,431
For retribution, for vengeance.

1199
01:17:15,531 --> 01:17:17,166
Behold my vengeance.

1200
01:17:35,618 --> 01:17:42,458
Anybody that feels bad,
just raise your hand.

1201
01:17:42,558 --> 01:17:44,728
Hey, this guy killed
the whole football team.

1202
01:17:44,828 --> 01:17:47,163
He's the toughest guy in school.

1203
01:17:47,263 --> 01:17:49,598
That's not the point.

1204
01:17:49,699 --> 01:17:51,500
You are one bad motherfucker.

1205
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:52,668
CROWD: Yeah.

1206
01:17:52,769 --> 01:17:55,204
Possibly, but, no, no.

1207
01:17:55,304 --> 01:17:57,473
Hey, this mean son of a
bitch got us out to class.

1208
01:17:57,573 --> 01:17:58,875
Let's hear it for him.

1209
01:17:58,975 --> 01:18:00,243
[Applause]

1210
01:18:00,343 --> 01:18:01,510
No, no.

1211
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:02,311
This is all wrong.

1212
01:18:02,411 --> 01:18:04,547
Feel bad, feel bad.

1213
01:18:25,835 --> 01:18:29,005
What are you going to do?

1214
01:18:29,105 --> 01:18:31,775
Expel me?

1215
01:18:31,875 --> 01:18:35,611
You're wandering the
school without a hall pass,

1216
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:38,848
Failing to attend a
mandatory school function,

1217
01:18:38,948 --> 01:18:42,118
And breaking into the
principal's office.

1218
01:18:42,218 --> 01:18:44,553
Ha, how would you handle it?

1219
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:54,430
Five day suspension
and a broken nose.

1220
01:18:54,530 --> 01:18:56,933
Heh-heh, if you were
in a forgiving mood.

1221
01:19:06,009 --> 01:19:08,978
I'm getting old, Dan.

1222
01:19:09,078 --> 01:19:11,214
Five years ago, I wouldn't
let the superintendent

1223
01:19:11,314 --> 01:19:15,684
Push me around this way,
conservative bastard.

1224
01:19:15,785 --> 01:19:17,854
I knew taking away
your gun was a mistake.

1225
01:19:17,954 --> 01:19:20,556
It is the only thing that
keeps order around here.

1226
01:19:25,929 --> 01:19:30,299
You know, the day's not over.

1227
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:42,345
You've always been
like a son to me, Dan.

1228
01:19:42,445 --> 01:19:45,281
Uh, I mean, except
that you're white,

1229
01:19:45,381 --> 01:19:54,557
But, um, what I'm trying to
say is go on to that assembly.

1230
01:19:54,657 --> 01:19:56,059
Kill one for me.

1231
01:20:03,166 --> 01:20:06,302
Go on, get out of here.

1232
01:20:06,402 --> 01:20:07,770
Day's almost over.

1233
01:20:19,382 --> 01:20:20,116
Crazy kid.

1234
01:20:42,071 --> 01:20:44,007
You're gonna have a tough
time walking to the assembly

1235
01:20:44,107 --> 01:20:47,043
With two broken legs.

1236
01:20:47,143 --> 01:20:49,312
We get smarter every
time you see us.

1237
01:20:49,412 --> 01:20:51,814
This time, we brought
weapons, dickhead.

1238
01:20:51,915 --> 01:20:53,216
What do you think about that?

1239
01:20:55,885 --> 01:20:56,719
What?

1240
01:20:56,819 --> 01:20:59,688
No catch phrase,
no snotty remark?

1241
01:20:59,788 --> 01:21:01,190
I gotta say, I'm a little...

1242
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:02,926
[Gunshot]

1243
01:21:03,026 --> 01:21:03,726
Pass.

1244
01:21:09,765 --> 01:21:10,833
Hey, get away from me.

1245
01:21:10,934 --> 01:21:11,867
I'm warning you.

1246
01:21:11,968 --> 01:21:13,136
I'm tired of putting
up with your shit.

1247
01:21:13,236 --> 01:21:14,203
Hey, what are you doing?

1248
01:21:14,303 --> 01:21:15,004
Where are you taking me?

1249
01:21:15,104 --> 01:21:16,405
Home.

1250
01:21:16,505 --> 01:21:18,741
I'm king of the school.

1251
01:21:18,841 --> 01:21:21,744
I'm standing here face to
face with the brutal football

1252
01:21:21,844 --> 01:21:22,878
Killer.

1253
01:21:22,979 --> 01:21:25,081
Killer, you have murdered
the football team

1254
01:21:25,181 --> 01:21:26,815
And gained acceptance
from your peers.

1255
01:21:26,916 --> 01:21:31,087
Everybody wants to know,
what are you going to do now?

1256
01:21:31,187 --> 01:21:33,789
Well, Lucy, while there's no
denying the brilliance of what

1257
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:36,292
I've done here today,
there's still so much more

1258
01:21:36,392 --> 01:21:37,526
To be accomplished.

1259
01:21:37,626 --> 01:21:39,162
I mean, there's the
basketball team,

1260
01:21:39,262 --> 01:21:41,364
The wrestling team,
and who else is

1261
01:21:41,464 --> 01:21:44,600
Sick and tired of pop quizzes?

1262
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:46,569
We can hardly wait.

1263
01:21:50,339 --> 01:21:51,707
Go ahead and drop me.
I know you want you.

1264
01:21:51,807 --> 01:21:53,042
You are from the high
school, I wouldn't

1265
01:21:53,142 --> 01:21:54,643
Expect anything creative.

1266
01:21:54,743 --> 01:21:56,045
What's that supposed to mean?

1267
01:21:56,145 --> 01:21:57,446
It means the
entire high school,

1268
01:21:57,546 --> 01:22:00,783
You included, has two things on
their mind, sex and violence.

1269
01:22:00,883 --> 01:22:03,286
Wait a second, who are
you to bad mouth violence?

1270
01:22:03,386 --> 01:22:05,321
You've been trying to
beat me up all day?

1271
01:22:05,421 --> 01:22:06,255
That's pretty violent.

1272
01:22:06,355 --> 01:22:07,991
It's a statement.

1273
01:22:08,091 --> 01:22:09,625
I'm the victim,
you're the bully.

1274
01:22:09,725 --> 01:22:11,394
I'm not a violent person.

1275
01:22:11,494 --> 01:22:13,896
I've been forced to take
violent actions to make a point,

1276
01:22:13,997 --> 01:22:16,065
Get it?

1277
01:22:16,165 --> 01:22:18,834
Idiot.

1278
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:23,572
Beating you up isn't violent,
it's a comment on violence.

1279
01:22:26,475 --> 01:22:28,077
Oh.

1280
01:22:28,177 --> 01:22:31,147
[Screaming]

1281
01:22:36,585 --> 01:22:38,921
That's deep, man.

1282
01:22:39,022 --> 01:22:40,356
[Applause]

1283
01:22:40,456 --> 01:22:42,191
And... and... and
no more homework,

1284
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:43,292
I'll abolish homework.

1285
01:22:43,392 --> 01:22:45,428
And no more essay exams.

1286
01:22:45,528 --> 01:22:49,365
From now on, it's nothing
but multiple choice, baby.

1287
01:22:49,465 --> 01:22:50,199
Stop.

1288
01:22:50,299 --> 01:22:51,800
This is wrong.

1289
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:56,772
I mean, look at yourselves,
look at what you have become.

1290
01:22:56,872 --> 01:23:01,044
He killed your friends and
now you're cheering for him?

1291
01:23:01,144 --> 01:23:02,878
What about the families
of these dead boys?

1292
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:04,780
Will they be cheering?

1293
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:07,783
Or what about the fans
of high school football?

1294
01:23:07,883 --> 01:23:09,885
Will they be cheering
in the stands tonight?

1295
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:11,887
Or what about the spotted owl?

1296
01:23:11,987 --> 01:23:13,156
[Gunshot]

1297
01:23:13,256 --> 01:23:16,992
I got your spotted
owl right here, bitch.

1298
01:23:17,093 --> 01:23:20,963
[Applause]

1299
01:23:22,565 --> 01:23:23,666
Save me, save me.

1300
01:23:23,766 --> 01:23:25,468
He said he'd kill me if I
didn't go along with it.

1301
01:23:33,076 --> 01:23:34,977
Don't move, man, or
I'll shoot the bitch.

1302
01:23:38,581 --> 01:23:39,982
Are you deaf, man?

1303
01:23:40,083 --> 01:23:40,983
I'll do it.

1304
01:23:46,589 --> 01:23:49,392
You're looking at a lifetime
of in-school suspension

1305
01:23:49,492 --> 01:23:52,061
If you don't drop the gun.

1306
01:23:52,161 --> 01:23:57,066
All right, you stupid
fuck, you asked for it.

1307
01:23:57,166 --> 01:24:00,503
[Gun clicking]

1308
01:24:02,938 --> 01:24:03,839
Look, babe.

1309
01:24:03,939 --> 01:24:06,209
Babe, I set up this
whole assembly.

1310
01:24:06,309 --> 01:24:07,443
What do you expect?

1311
01:24:07,543 --> 01:24:09,044
I'm going to let
the bad guy win?

1312
01:24:16,819 --> 01:24:19,455
Looks like you get
to go home early.

1313
01:24:19,555 --> 01:24:20,256
Stop.

1314
01:24:20,356 --> 01:24:21,557
This is wrong.

1315
01:24:21,657 --> 01:24:23,492
What have you become?

1316
01:24:23,592 --> 01:24:25,394
He's no better than the killer.

1317
01:24:25,494 --> 01:24:28,897
You're simply trading one
homicidal maniac for another.

1318
01:24:28,997 --> 01:24:30,032
I say we...

1319
01:24:30,133 --> 01:24:32,368
[Gunshot]

1320
01:24:32,468 --> 01:24:35,271
[Applause]

1321
01:24:35,371 --> 01:24:42,578
You got something to
say, you raise your hand.

1322
01:24:50,953 --> 01:24:55,424
Wait, wait, wait,
this solves nothing.

1323
01:24:55,524 --> 01:24:57,960
If you kill me, my
legend will live on.

1324
01:24:58,060 --> 01:25:00,463
I'll become a martyr and
others will rise up in my name

1325
01:25:00,563 --> 01:25:03,799
And bring the
school to its knees.

1326
01:25:03,899 --> 01:25:05,901
What do have to say about that?

1327
01:25:06,001 --> 01:25:09,838
Hm, super.

1328
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:10,639
Uh.

1329
01:25:25,521 --> 01:25:28,857
[Bell ringing]

1330
01:25:48,911 --> 01:25:49,612
Huh?

1331
01:25:54,583 --> 01:25:55,984
Maury.

1332
01:25:56,084 --> 01:25:57,119
Oh, fuck.

1333
01:26:05,261 --> 01:26:07,463
Come on, let's go.

1334
01:26:07,563 --> 01:26:08,997
What?

1335
01:26:09,097 --> 01:26:10,366
School's over.

1336
01:26:10,466 --> 01:26:11,467
It's time to go home.

1337
01:26:15,704 --> 01:26:18,173
For Christ's sake,
turn the damn thing off.

1338
01:26:18,274 --> 01:26:19,675
It's over.

1339
01:26:19,775 --> 01:26:20,643
No, no, wait.

1340
01:26:20,743 --> 01:26:22,578
Keep rolling, keep rolling.

1341
01:26:25,881 --> 01:26:26,815
Die.

1342
01:26:26,915 --> 01:26:29,952
Die, you bad, evil,
horrible man, you.

1343
01:26:30,052 --> 01:26:30,753
Are you getting this?

1344
01:26:30,853 --> 01:26:31,554
Are you getting this?

1345
01:26:31,654 --> 01:26:32,955
I'm saving the day here.

1346
01:26:33,055 --> 01:26:34,223
I hate you.

1347
01:26:34,323 --> 01:26:35,291
Let it go, Lucy.

1348
01:26:35,391 --> 01:26:36,359
We'll miss the bus.

1349
01:26:39,161 --> 01:26:40,729
What did I do wrong?

1350
01:26:40,829 --> 01:26:43,866
I wore the dress,
I was vulnerable.

1351
01:26:43,966 --> 01:26:45,834
He didn't even kiss me.

1352
01:26:45,934 --> 01:26:49,738
I must look pathetic.

1353
01:26:49,838 --> 01:26:51,674
Oh, don't worry about it, babe.

1354
01:26:51,774 --> 01:26:54,643
We still got each other.

1355
01:26:54,743 --> 01:26:57,613
[Crying]

1356
01:26:58,514 --> 01:26:59,748
You OK there, buddy?

1357
01:26:59,848 --> 01:27:02,985
I didn't... I didn't hurt
you too much, did I?

1358
01:27:03,085 --> 01:27:04,787
Can I ask you a question?

1359
01:27:04,887 --> 01:27:06,121
Yeah, sure.

1360
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:09,658
TEAM: What the fuck is
wrong with you people?

1361
01:27:09,758 --> 01:27:12,094
They don't teach you anything
down in the Vo-Tech, do they?

1362
01:27:26,609 --> 01:27:27,510
This isn't over.

1363
01:27:27,610 --> 01:27:28,877
We'll meet again.

1364
01:27:28,977 --> 01:27:30,613
I'll see you Monday, dickhead.

1365
01:27:30,713 --> 01:27:31,414
Ow.

1366
01:27:37,219 --> 01:27:39,154
You were right about one thing.

1367
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:40,989
What's that?

1368
01:27:41,089 --> 01:27:42,791
Everything's a lie
in the high school.

1369
01:27:42,891 --> 01:27:45,027
It's all image and status.

1370
01:27:45,127 --> 01:27:47,162
The whole place is full of shit.

1371
01:27:51,734 --> 01:27:52,968
Here, watch this.

1372
01:27:53,068 --> 01:27:55,304
Hey, Wendy?

1373
01:27:55,404 --> 01:27:58,407
Do you wanna go out tonight?

1374
01:27:58,507 --> 01:28:00,943
Drop dead, freak.

1375
01:28:01,043 --> 01:28:01,810
See?

1376
01:28:01,910 --> 01:28:03,045
It's all bullshit.

1377
01:28:03,145 --> 01:28:05,514
You made a mistake when
you started believing it.

1378
01:28:05,614 --> 01:28:06,649
That's OK.

1379
01:28:06,749 --> 01:28:08,283
I know how hard it is
when the whole school's

1380
01:28:08,384 --> 01:28:09,284
Cheering for you.

1381
01:28:09,385 --> 01:28:10,686
Trust me.

1382
01:28:10,786 --> 01:28:12,855
Dude, when you, like,
had your gun in his face,

1383
01:28:12,955 --> 01:28:15,358
That was so cool, man.

1384
01:28:22,898 --> 01:28:23,799
God, I love that.

1385
01:28:42,818 --> 01:28:44,987
So everything's just a big lie?

1386
01:28:48,357 --> 01:28:50,693
But I killed the
entire football team.

1387
01:28:50,793 --> 01:28:53,662
There's got to be a consequence
for doing something like that.

1388
01:28:53,762 --> 01:28:56,031
Well, you'd think
so, wouldn't you?

1389
01:28:56,131 --> 01:28:58,567
But look at me, I kill
students every day

1390
01:28:58,667 --> 01:29:01,670
And everybody loves me.

1391
01:29:01,770 --> 01:29:05,541
You do realize, of course,
that, uh, come Monday,

1392
01:29:05,641 --> 01:29:09,011
I'm going to have
to take you down.

1393
01:29:09,111 --> 01:29:10,746
I think I'll transfer
to another school.

1394
01:29:10,846 --> 01:29:12,114
Not a bad idea.

1395
01:29:17,185 --> 01:29:19,555
Sweetie, over here, let's go.

1396
01:29:24,627 --> 01:29:25,428
That's my ride.

1397
01:29:25,528 --> 01:29:28,531
I gotta go.

1398
01:29:28,631 --> 01:29:31,366
Have a good weekend.

1399
01:29:31,467 --> 01:29:32,167
Yeah.

1400
01:30:07,703 --> 01:30:08,403
Hi, honey.

1401
01:30:08,504 --> 01:30:09,472
How was your day?

1402
01:30:09,572 --> 01:30:11,373
Mom, what did I tell
you about pulling

1403
01:30:11,474 --> 01:30:12,608
Up in front of the school?

1404
01:30:12,708 --> 01:30:15,143
It's bad for my image.

1405
01:30:15,243 --> 01:30:18,581
My, aren't we in a good mood?

1406
01:30:18,681 --> 01:30:19,648
I'm sorry, Mom.

1407
01:30:19,748 --> 01:30:22,985
I've had a real weird day.

1408
01:30:23,085 --> 01:30:25,187
You ever feel like
you just kind of,

1409
01:30:25,287 --> 01:30:28,924
I don't know, forget something?

1410
01:30:29,024 --> 01:30:30,626
Oh, never mind.

1411
01:30:30,726 --> 01:30:31,594
What's for dinner?

1412
01:30:35,598 --> 01:30:40,268
Orange 41, green 33.

1413
01:30:40,368 --> 01:30:41,937
Can I get a hut 1?

1414
01:30:42,037 --> 01:30:44,139
Can I get a hut 2?

1415
01:30:44,239 --> 01:30:46,842
Hut.

1416
01:30:46,942 --> 01:30:47,743
Can I get a hut?

1417
01:30:55,951 --> 01:30:57,953
[Screaming]

1418
01:31:20,242 --> 01:31:23,512
