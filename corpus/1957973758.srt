1
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:39,839
That's an interesting doodle
you got there.

2
00:00:39,841 --> 00:00:41,007
-Sorry?

3
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:42,008
-That's interesting.

4
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:43,076
-Oh.

5
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:45,847
Yeah. I have a fear of flying.

6
00:00:46,948 --> 00:00:48,215
-It's funny.

7
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:50,952
I mean it's wildly
inappropriate but...

8
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:52,317
It's funny.

9
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:53,721
-Thanks.

10
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:55,422
-Did you have a nice vacation?

11
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,188
A nice vacation?

12
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,894
-Oh. I'm from Florida.

13
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,261
-Oh.

14
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:04,933
I don't know why I assumed that
plane was full of snowbirds.

15
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:08,435
-Well...

16
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,972
Actually, I don't live
there anymore.

17
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:13,140
-Oh.

18
00:01:13,608 --> 00:01:15,106
-I'm moving to New York.

19
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:16,308
Right now.

20
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,713
From Florida. This is my move.

21
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:20,682
-Congratulations.

22
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:22,951
-Thank you!

23
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:28,022
-Here.

24
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:29,724
Take it.

25
00:01:32,994 --> 00:01:34,492
I don't know what you think

26
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:35,995
New York is going to be like.

27
00:01:35,997 --> 00:01:37,362
But

28
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:38,866
I have to tell you,

29
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:42,036
it won't be.

30
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:45,838
Welcome to
Terminal 8

31
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,042

International Airport.

Welcome!

55
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,573
-Hi!

56
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:28,843
-Hi!

57
00:03:28,976 --> 00:03:30,745
Look at all your stuff.

58
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,914
Oh, sorry.
I'm so gross right now.

59
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,314
-Oh no.
You're fine.

60
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:38,718
-Wait. But we're like,
overall twins.

61
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,119
-Oh yeah.

62
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:41,889
-Wait. This is like a sign.

63
00:03:43,191 --> 00:03:44,422
This is perfect.

64
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,359
Okay. Come on.
Bring your stuff in.

65
00:03:50,164 --> 00:03:53,134
This is the front room.

66
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,134
And I know it's kind of plain
right now.

67
00:03:55,136 --> 00:03:58,003
But we're thinking of
transforming it into some kind

68
00:03:58,005 --> 00:04:00,506
of parlor situation.

69
00:04:00,508 --> 00:04:02,007
Like a salon.

70
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:04,043
And then, over here,

71
00:04:04,045 --> 00:04:05,644
I don't want to get a
pool table

72
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:08,714
but I want to do something that
evokes the same kind of

73
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:09,951
homeliness.

74
00:04:10,952 --> 00:04:12,419
Yeah.

75
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:15,255
Do they let you build your own
fireplaces in New York?

76
00:04:16,758 --> 00:04:18,226
-Are you asking me?

77
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:23,430
-Alexa! Remind me to look up
fireplace laws.

78
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:26,532
Oh, you know what?

79
00:04:26,534 --> 00:04:27,835
Bill must have unplugged it.

80
00:04:27,869 --> 00:04:29,737
He's so afraid of that thing.
It's kind of cute.

81
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:31,804
-Oh. You have a dog!

82
00:04:31,806 --> 00:04:33,072
-I do!
Yeah. That's Frida.

83
00:04:33,074 --> 00:04:34,472
But don't touch her!

84
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:35,875
We didn't get her
flea shots this year.

85
00:04:35,877 --> 00:04:37,143
So...

86
00:04:37,145 --> 00:04:38,376
-Yeah.

87
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:39,714
Let's keep going!

88
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:42,917
The bathroom. Obviously.

89
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:45,383
I painted it pink last year.

90
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:47,285
And it was yellow the year
before that.

91
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:51,223
But now I'm thinking some kind
of nautical blue.

92
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:53,893
And then I want to do
a mural on the back to match.

93
00:04:53,895 --> 00:04:54,927
Like a whale.

94
00:04:54,929 --> 00:04:56,296
You've read Moby Dick?

95
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:57,732
-Uh no.
Have you?

96
00:04:58,465 --> 00:04:59,901
-Uh no.
But I've seen the movie.

97
00:05:00,168 --> 00:05:02,735
-Oh. I didn't realize
they made a Moby Dick movie.

98
00:05:02,737 --> 00:05:05,303
-Yeah. Or no.
That was Jaws.

99
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,707
Yeah. They made Jaws movie.

100
00:05:07,542 --> 00:05:08,674
Have you seen Jaws?

101
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:10,912
-Oh yeah. Totally.
So good, right?

102
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:13,714
-Yeah. It's alright.

103
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:20,721
Voila.

104
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,690
-I know I said I would have it
painted

105
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:25,891
by the time you got here

106
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:28,194
but I just finished
the last wall

107
00:05:28,196 --> 00:05:29,263
so we're good!

108
00:05:29,764 --> 00:05:31,732
-Okay. Cool.

109
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,500
Thanks.

110
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:35,768
-You're welcome.

111
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:36,936
Oh. Sorry, don't
lean on the wall.

112
00:05:36,938 --> 00:05:38,606
-Okay.
-It's still wet.

113
00:05:38,773 --> 00:05:40,074
-Oh, this wall too?

114
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,274
-Yeah. And that wall.

115
00:05:42,276 --> 00:05:45,246
And that wall. And that wall.
Yeah.

116
00:05:46,314 --> 00:05:47,813
-So all the walls?

117
00:05:47,815 --> 00:05:49,050
-Yeah. Just about.

118
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,884
But don't worry. The paint's
going to dry really soon.

119
00:05:51,886 --> 00:05:53,120
Like, by tonight, for sure.

120
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,856
It's really good paint.

121
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,456
It's really good paint.

122
00:05:57,325 --> 00:05:58,826
I'll let you get settled.

123
00:06:00,962 --> 00:06:02,828
Oh, sorry. Don't open
the window.

124
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,098
Because the paint
won't dry.

125
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:07,400
But I'll leave this door open.
So you don't suffocate.

126
00:06:08,703 --> 00:06:09,937
Seriously.

127
00:06:28,122 --> 00:06:29,156
Where are you off to?

128
00:06:30,091 --> 00:06:32,760
-Oh, I'm just going to
get a quick bite.

129
00:06:33,127 --> 00:06:35,029
-Is it on top of a
mountain?

130
00:06:35,096 --> 00:06:36,262
-What?

131
00:06:36,264 --> 00:06:37,830
-Oh!

132
00:06:37,832 --> 00:06:40,332
No, I just didn't have enough
space in my bag

133
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:41,333
for another coat.

134
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:43,204
-Oh baby.
You can't wear this.

135
00:06:43,638 --> 00:06:44,803
You can stay and eat
with me and Bill.

136
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:45,738
It'll be fun.

137
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,440
-Oh no, I don't want to impose.

138
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:49,310
-You live here now.

139
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,776
And I want to feed you!

140
00:06:50,778 --> 00:06:53,748
I want you to stay.
I'm inviting you to eat with us.

141
00:06:54,782 --> 00:06:57,283
-Okay. Okay.
That's a good point.

142
00:06:57,285 --> 00:06:59,520
-No, it's a fantastic point.

143
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:02,223
How old are you anyway?

144
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:03,454
-21.

145
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:05,190
-Fuck me!

146
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:06,360
Wow!

147
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,031
Ah, awesome.
That's awesome for you.

148
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,530
-How old are you?

149
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:13,431
Babe, babe, babe!

150
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,602
Hi!

151
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:20,239
-Hey, what's up? I'm Bill.

152
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:21,607
Hi.

153
00:07:21,609 --> 00:07:22,641
Don't you know
who this is?

154
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:24,578
-No, can't say I do.

155
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:25,978
I'm Lisa!

156
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,946
-It's Lisa.

157
00:07:26,948 --> 00:07:28,580
-Lisa, cool.

158
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:29,984
-She's our new roommate.

159
00:07:31,085 --> 00:07:33,387
-Um, what?

160
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:36,924
-What?

161
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:39,760
-No. Doug's going to be our
new roommate.

162
00:07:40,728 --> 00:07:43,028
-No, he's not. Lisa is.

163
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,563
Our mom's are friends.

164
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:45,633
I told you this.

165
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,466
-Actually, no.
No, you didn't tell me.

166
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,401
This.

167
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:51,539
-Yeah, I did.
Or I thought I...

168
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:53,841
-Doug's coming next week.

169
00:07:54,275 --> 00:07:55,876
He's been looking forward to
this for months.

170
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,377
-Okay, well, I'm sorry.

171
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:01,080
Lisa's here so she's our
new roommate.

172
00:08:01,082 --> 00:08:04,051
-What the fuck, babe? Why are
you always pulling this shit?

173
00:08:04,085 --> 00:08:05,818
-I'm not pulling anything.

174
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,054
-Yeah, you are.

175
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:09,121
This. This, this is pulling.

176
00:08:09,123 --> 00:08:10,589
-Okay, well now you're
scaring her.

177
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:12,224
-I'm not scaring her.
Am I scaring you?

178
00:08:12,226 --> 00:08:13,125
-No!

179
00:08:13,127 --> 00:08:14,326
-See. You just don't like Doug.

180
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:15,260
That's what this is
about, right?

181
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:16,261
-No.

182
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:19,200
But, let me just say, unrelated,

183
00:08:19,767 --> 00:08:21,266
I don't like Doug.

184
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:22,903
-At least he's not a stranger.

185
00:08:23,204 --> 00:08:24,903
-Our mom's are friends!

186
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:26,374
-I'm not a murderer or anything.

187
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:27,806
-Great. She's not a murderer.

188
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:28,976
I guess it's all good then.

189
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:31,076
Uh, I was having such
a good day.

190
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:33,746
Like a really fantastic day,
actually. And now...

191
00:08:33,748 --> 00:08:35,014
I'm sorry.

192
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:36,148
Can we just eat something?

193
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,316
I'm starving.

194
00:08:37,318 --> 00:08:38,452
-Yeah, I can make you something.

195
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,519
I'm just going to go get a
slice of pizza or something.

196
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:43,389
-No. No, you're going to stay
here and eat with me and Bill.

197
00:08:43,391 --> 00:08:44,390
Oh, Holly, no.

198
00:08:44,392 --> 00:08:45,457
Thank you so much.

199
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:46,494
It's okay, it's totally fine.

200
00:08:46,761 --> 00:08:49,028
I didn't get enough food.
I only have spaghetti.

201
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,295
I've never had New York
pizza so I don't really mind--

202
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:51,397
Oh my god! Shut up!

203
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:52,500
Fuck! Shut up!

204
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,900
We'll eat dinner here, together.

205
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:56,003
Okay?

206
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:58,105
Fuck.

207
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,909
I have no idea what
I'm going to tell Doug.

208
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:03,377
Tell him the truth.

209
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:05,046
And also that he's a scumbag.

210
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,482
It was going to be a lot
of fun living with him too.

211
00:09:09,518 --> 00:09:12,253
I mean, I'm really excited to
live with you too, Leslie.

212
00:09:12,987 --> 00:09:13,954
It's Lisa.

213
00:09:14,088 --> 00:09:15,423
Lisa, yeah.

214
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:19,191
So you have a job lined up?

215
00:09:19,193 --> 00:09:20,292
-Bill!

216
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:22,963
-What?
-You're being so fucking rude.

217
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:38,944
Negativity that invades
Lisa's sacred space.

218
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:42,316
I banish you with the light
of my grace.

219
00:09:43,084 --> 00:09:45,352
You have no hold
or power here.

220
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:48,454
And I stand and face you
with no fear.

221
00:09:48,456 --> 00:09:51,490
Be gone forever. For this,
I will say.

222
00:09:51,492 --> 00:09:56,130
This is Lisa's sacred space.
And you will obey.

223
00:10:36,871 --> 00:10:39,004
I know your mom said that
these people were eccentric

224
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:41,142
but I think that's, like,
next level.

225
00:10:41,242 --> 00:10:44,243
You could end up as one of
those roommate murder stories.

226
00:10:44,245 --> 00:10:45,878
-That's not a thing.

227
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,215
-It is a thing. I mean, there's
a whole podcast about it.

228
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:51,250
-No, I just don't think they're
the murdering type, anyway.

229
00:10:51,252 --> 00:10:53,752
-Maybe not. But there is one
thing you could do though

230
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:54,720
just to be safe.

231
00:10:54,722 --> 00:10:55,787
-What?

232
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:57,057
-Kill them first.

233
00:10:58,993 --> 00:11:01,160
-I can't wait until your
lease is up.

234
00:11:01,162 --> 00:11:02,363
-Samesies.

235
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,566
-I'm really happy you're here.

236
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,067
-Double samesies.

237
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:12,006
-Does your mom know we're
going to be living together?

238
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:16,708
-She doesn't even know about my
Feel The Bern tattoo.

239
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,180
So that's a hard no.

240
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,749
Do you have a job, yet?

241
00:11:22,116 --> 00:11:23,552
-Also a hard no.

242
00:11:24,185 --> 00:11:25,384
-Yeah, that's something you're
probably going to want to

243
00:11:25,386 --> 00:11:26,187
get soon.

244
00:11:26,588 --> 00:11:28,989
Seeing as you're, like, an
adult now and all.

245
00:11:30,491 --> 00:11:31,859
What's your plan exactly?

246
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:35,796
-I don't have a plan.
Which is my plan.

247
00:11:36,297 --> 00:11:38,132
-You should temp.
That's what you should do.

248
00:11:38,332 --> 00:11:40,332
That's why I did my first year.
They basically just pay you

249
00:11:40,334 --> 00:11:42,301
the whole time to play phone
games in the bathroom.

250
00:11:42,303 --> 00:11:43,437
It's awesome.

251
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:46,807
-Yeah but that just feels like a
waste of time.

252
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:49,076
-Did I mention they pay you?

253
00:11:52,346 --> 00:11:54,415
-How many times have you
come to this park?

254
00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:55,749
-I mean...

255
00:11:57,652 --> 00:11:59,887
Guess the last time was, like,
a year ago.

256
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:03,224
-I'm going to come here
all the time.

257
00:12:03,357 --> 00:12:04,323
-You think?

258
00:12:04,325 --> 00:12:05,859
-Yeah.

259
00:12:13,568 --> 00:12:15,434
No way! Fuck you.

260
00:12:15,436 --> 00:12:17,302
It's the truth!

261
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:18,638
-You are, you're
so full of shit.

262
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,644
-I swear to God,
I hooked up with James Franco.

263
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,715
-No you didn't.

264
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:29,083
-I didn't fuck him.

265
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,620
We just did, like, mouth stuff.

266
00:12:31,852 --> 00:12:33,254
-When did this happen?

267
00:12:33,521 --> 00:12:35,823
-I don't know, like,
three years ago.

268
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:38,792
-And you're just telling me now?

269
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:41,895
-You're not jealous, are you?

270
00:12:44,298 --> 00:12:47,734
Oh my God, babe.
Are you actually upset?

271
00:12:47,736 --> 00:12:49,201
Come on.
It's James Franco!

272
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:50,603
What do you expect
me to do?

273
00:12:50,605 --> 00:12:53,005
-We were dating three years ago.

274
00:12:53,007 --> 00:12:55,276
Are you fucking kidding--
-Barely!

275
00:12:55,409 --> 00:12:56,942
I shouldn't
have told you.

276
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:58,410
-No, you shouldn't have
fucked him is what you--

277
00:12:58,412 --> 00:12:59,811
-I said, I didn't--

278
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:01,947
Oh fuck! Fuck!

279
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:03,248
-Goddammit!

280
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,817
You're such a fucking clumsy
drunk sometimes.

281
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:06,787
-Shut up!

282
00:13:07,221 --> 00:13:09,087
-Should we just clean it up
or what, like...

283
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:10,422
-We'll just do it tomorrow.

284
00:13:10,424 --> 00:13:12,725
-I mean, it's right outside
Lisa's door.

285
00:13:12,727 --> 00:13:14,261
-We'll be up before her.
Don't worry.

286
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:16,665
-Yeah, that's a good point.

287
00:14:51,826 --> 00:14:52,861
Oh fuck!

288
00:14:53,427 --> 00:14:56,564
Sorry. I didn't realize
there was a door there.

289
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,070
Okay.

290
00:15:04,672 --> 00:15:06,340
I'm going to head to my room.

291
00:16:22,249 --> 00:16:23,383
Give me some.

292
00:16:24,886 --> 00:16:26,086
I'm cutting you off.

293
00:16:26,353 --> 00:16:28,119
-But you've had so much
more than me.

294
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:30,390
-Yeah, because I don't get
paranoid, babe.

295
00:16:31,225 --> 00:16:32,326
-Whatever.

296
00:16:35,062 --> 00:16:36,363
Lisa!

297
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:39,767
Lisa, come here!

298
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:48,242
Come sit.

299
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:55,148
Where were you?

300
00:16:56,951 --> 00:16:58,553
-Times Square.

301
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,522
-Don't you love it there?

302
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:02,053
-Yeah.

303
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:03,525
-Oh, do you want
any weed?

304
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:05,994
-Oh no. No thank you.

305
00:17:06,594 --> 00:17:08,195
-Suit yourself.

306
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:13,866
Oh, Bill was really worried
about you earlier.

307
00:17:13,868 --> 00:17:14,967
-No I wasn't.

308
00:17:14,969 --> 00:17:15,968
-Yeah, you were.

309
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,572
-What are you talking about?

310
00:17:18,006 --> 00:17:21,406
-You were like "where's Lisa?"
"Should we text her?"

311
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:22,775
"When's she coming home?"

312
00:17:22,777 --> 00:17:24,142
-I never said that.

313
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:25,477
-Yeah, you did.

314
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:26,514
Were you worried about me?

315
00:17:26,681 --> 00:17:29,281
-Don't listen to her.
She's stoned out of her mind.

316
00:17:29,283 --> 00:17:31,316
Okay, don't
be embarrassed.

317
00:17:31,318 --> 00:17:33,184
It shows that you care
about Lisa.

318
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:34,486
-I don't care about...

319
00:17:34,488 --> 00:17:35,621
I mean, I care.

320
00:17:35,623 --> 00:17:36,622
But I'm not like...

321
00:17:36,624 --> 00:17:37,659
Oh my God, you like me.

322
00:17:38,026 --> 00:17:40,225
Ooh yeah. You have a
little crush on Lisa.

323
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:41,527
What the fuck?

324
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:42,995
Where is this coming from?

325
00:17:42,997 --> 00:17:45,898
-Oh my gosh, you like me.

326
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,198
Awww.

327
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,501
Oh my God.
You like me.

328
00:17:48,503 --> 00:17:50,101
You're the one who
has the crush.

329
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:51,469
-What the fuck are you
talking about?

330
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:53,007
Okay, now
you're getting weird.

331
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:55,043
-I'm not getting weird.

332
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,548
I think I just need to
go to bed.

333
00:18:00,982 --> 00:18:02,249
I'm stoned.

334
00:18:03,918 --> 00:18:05,150
Maybe I'm being weird.

335
00:18:05,152 --> 00:18:06,819
I don't know.
I'm going to go to bed though.

336
00:18:06,821 --> 00:18:08,088
Okay.

337
00:18:08,322 --> 00:18:11,222
So... you guys have fun.

338
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:12,459
-Okay.

339
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,627
Party pooper.

340
00:18:14,629 --> 00:18:16,396
-Yeah, love you too.

341
00:18:18,633 --> 00:18:21,536
-Alexa, play music.

342
00:18:23,905 --> 00:18:25,773
-I think Bill unplugged it.

343
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,677
-He's the one who's paranoid.

344
00:18:51,866 --> 00:18:53,099
Is somebody here?

345
00:18:53,101 --> 00:18:56,671
-Oh, it's just my boyfriend.

346
00:18:57,437 --> 00:18:59,304
Hi!
-Hey!

347
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:00,640
This is, like,
deep Brooklyn.

348
00:19:00,642 --> 00:19:01,874
-Hey, what's up?

349
00:19:01,876 --> 00:19:03,042
I'm Bill.

350
00:19:03,044 --> 00:19:05,044
-Eric. Nice to meet you.

351
00:19:05,046 --> 00:19:06,144
Hi.

352
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:07,513
-She doesn't like strangers.

353
00:19:07,515 --> 00:19:10,516
You're Lisa's boyfriend? Or...

354
00:19:10,518 --> 00:19:13,888
-Yep. Yep.
We're dating.

355
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:16,488
-Yeah, she just never mentioned
you before so I

356
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,757
wanted to check.

357
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:19,027
-That's funny.

358
00:19:19,694 --> 00:19:21,594
Yeah, no, we've been
dating for...

359
00:19:21,596 --> 00:19:23,596
well, we met in
anthropology class.

360
00:19:23,598 --> 00:19:25,230
-You in Manhattan? Or...

361
00:19:25,232 --> 00:19:27,265
-Uh, yeah. Yeah.
I'm in the...

362
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:29,434
Upper... Upper East Side.

363
00:19:29,436 --> 00:19:30,938
-Oh nice.

364
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,303
-It's expensive up there.

365
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:34,239
-It's getting more
affordable actually.

366
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:35,643
It's getting more
affordable, I think.

367
00:19:36,778 --> 00:19:38,243
-Well thanks for...

368
00:19:38,245 --> 00:19:39,879
It was nice to meet you, man.
-Nice to meet you.

369
00:19:39,881 --> 00:19:41,446
I got to work
on some music but,

370
00:19:41,448 --> 00:19:43,181
yeah, let me know if I'm
bothering you or...

371
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:44,351
if it's too loud.

372
00:19:45,153 --> 00:19:46,619
Yeah, so let me know
if you need anything.

373
00:19:46,621 --> 00:19:47,787
-Alright. Thanks man.

374
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:49,254
Alright. We'll see ya.

375
00:19:49,256 --> 00:19:50,488
-You guys enjoy yourselves.

376
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,223
-Oh, we will.

377
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:53,559
Where am I going?

378
00:19:53,561 --> 00:19:54,996
This one.

379
00:19:57,598 --> 00:19:59,765
-Oh. Sad.

380
00:19:59,767 --> 00:20:00,966
-What?

381
00:20:00,968 --> 00:20:02,568
-Sorry.

382
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:05,106
You're supposed to tell me
that guy's not a murderer?

383
00:20:05,973 --> 00:20:09,177
-Yeah. He's gotten a lot better
since day one.

384
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,478
-And you don't talk about me?

385
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,082
-Sorry.

386
00:20:14,682 --> 00:20:17,516
He just stopped calling me
"that girl in Doug's room."

387
00:20:17,518 --> 00:20:19,120
- Is that him?

388
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:22,287
-Yeah, I think he's
in a band or something.

389
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:23,589
He's always practicing.

390
00:20:23,591 --> 00:20:25,392
-Doesn't he have a job?

391
00:20:29,564 --> 00:20:30,765
At least he sounds good.

392
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:33,433

-Yeah.

403
00:22:46,067 --> 00:22:48,536
-Hey, is it okay if I
smoke in here?

404
00:22:49,237 --> 00:22:50,738
-If it's weed, it's fine.

405
00:22:51,572 --> 00:22:54,242
But if it's cigarettes, you
got to smoke it out the window.

406
00:22:54,508 --> 00:22:56,244
-But I don't want to go to the
window.

407
00:22:56,811 --> 00:22:59,113
-Guess you got to
start smoking weed, then.

408
00:23:00,848 --> 00:23:02,147
-You know, if you were
a real New Yorker,

409
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:04,352
you'd just start chain-smoking
like the rest of us.

410
00:23:04,852 --> 00:23:06,451
-Nice try.

411
00:23:06,453 --> 00:23:07,788
-Think about it.

412
00:23:10,658 --> 00:23:12,760
-I can't wait until we have our
own place.

413
00:23:13,194 --> 00:23:14,461
Just the two of us.

414
00:23:15,062 --> 00:23:16,228
It's going to be so nice.

415
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,464
-Look, problem solved.

416
00:23:28,576 --> 00:23:30,945
-Hey, you wanna
hang out tomorrow?

417
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:33,614
We could go ice skating
and exploring.

418
00:23:33,748 --> 00:23:35,182
-Um...

419
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:37,318
Tomorrow's not really good
for me. But...

420
00:23:38,052 --> 00:23:39,919
I don't know.
Maybe...

421
00:23:39,921 --> 00:23:41,253
-Maybe Wednesday?

422
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:43,391
Well, I got work Wednesday.

423
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:44,590
It's actually--

424
00:23:44,592 --> 00:23:46,027
It's a pretty busy week.

425
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,595
Yeah.

426
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:50,296
-Okay.

427
00:23:50,298 --> 00:23:51,532
-Kind of a busy month.

428
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:53,466
We'll find some time though.

429
00:23:55,937 --> 00:23:58,370
-Well, at least we have today.

430
00:23:58,372 --> 00:23:59,538
-Yeah.

431
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,906
-Just do nothing.

432
00:24:00,908 --> 00:24:02,074
-Yeah.
-Just exist.

433
00:24:02,076 --> 00:24:03,242
-Yeah.

434
00:24:03,244 --> 00:24:04,510
Yeah.

435
00:24:10,318 --> 00:24:11,552
Uh oh.

436
00:24:12,553 --> 00:24:14,422
That's a negativo, kiddo.
I'm sorry.

437
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:18,192
Someone's got to cover for
Nathan at work.

438
00:24:18,491 --> 00:24:19,591
-Wait!

439
00:24:19,593 --> 00:24:21,360
Can we hang out when
you're done?

440
00:24:21,362 --> 00:24:22,897
-Maybe.

441
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:27,735
Probably not.

442
00:24:29,637 --> 00:24:30,871
I'll text you.
How's that?

443
00:24:32,073 --> 00:24:33,341
-Okay.

444
00:24:33,374 --> 00:24:34,809
-Okay. Um...

445
00:24:35,276 --> 00:24:36,442
This was fun.

446
00:24:36,444 --> 00:24:37,743
I love you. Okay.

447
00:24:37,745 --> 00:24:38,911
-Bye!

448
00:24:38,913 --> 00:24:40,247
-Bye.

449
00:24:43,884 --> 00:24:45,152
-Okay.

450
00:25:07,808 --> 00:25:08,974
Hi!

451
00:25:08,976 --> 00:25:10,478
I'm Lisa.
I'm the new temp.

452
00:25:10,811 --> 00:25:11,944
-Excuse me?

453
00:25:11,946 --> 00:25:14,646
I'm from Robert Hall
Temp Agency.

454
00:25:14,648 --> 00:25:15,716
-Oh I'm sorry.

455
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,950
We're not interested, actually.
But thank you so much.

456
00:25:17,952 --> 00:25:19,084
-No.

457
00:25:19,086 --> 00:25:20,719
I'm here to work.
You guys hired me.

458
00:25:20,721 --> 00:25:21,820
I'm the temp.

459
00:25:21,822 --> 00:25:22,888
-Oh.

460
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:24,492
-You were expecting me,
right?

461
00:25:25,126 --> 00:25:26,394
-You said you're a temp?

462
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,526
-Yeah.

463
00:25:27,528 --> 00:25:28,827
-What is that?

464
00:25:28,829 --> 00:25:30,231
-What's a temp?

465
00:25:31,265 --> 00:25:32,600
-Oh, you said temp.

466
00:25:33,034 --> 00:25:34,268
Oh.

467
00:25:34,869 --> 00:25:36,404
I thought you said "tent."

468
00:25:36,971 --> 00:25:39,373
And I was like,
"what the heck?"

469
00:25:41,075 --> 00:25:42,410
I know what a temp is.

470
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:45,778
You can sit over there for now.

471
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,379
If you want.

472
00:25:47,381 --> 00:25:48,649
And...

473
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:52,084
Oh wait.
Actually, you're a...

474
00:25:52,086 --> 00:25:53,387
You're probably
the receptionist.

475
00:25:54,155 --> 00:25:56,922
So you would sit here.
And I'll sit over there.

476
00:25:56,924 --> 00:25:57,956
Is how it should go.

477
00:25:57,958 --> 00:25:59,226
-Okay.

478
00:26:09,603 --> 00:26:10,971
-Where do you go to school?

479
00:26:11,472 --> 00:26:13,639
-I went to Florida State
University.

480
00:26:13,641 --> 00:26:15,609
But I already graduated.

481
00:26:16,043 --> 00:26:18,412
Oh, so you're like a
real adult then.

482
00:26:19,647 --> 00:26:20,815
-Yeah.

483
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:24,016
Are you like...

484
00:26:24,018 --> 00:26:27,221
-I go to New York University,
NYU, down the way.

485
00:26:27,922 --> 00:26:29,054
And...

486
00:26:29,056 --> 00:26:31,158
My uncle actually owns
this place.

487
00:26:33,594 --> 00:26:35,564
And he gave me like a little
part-time gig here.

488
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:38,399
So I'm just kind of riding
that out.

489
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,839
I'm going to go on a smoke
break.

490
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,107
Do you want to come?

491
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,213
Do you need...

492
00:26:54,215 --> 00:26:55,249
-Yeah.

493
00:26:58,285 --> 00:26:59,386
Thank you.

494
00:27:08,762 --> 00:27:09,928
Oh do you need a light too?

495
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,065
-Yes please.

496
00:27:14,635 --> 00:27:16,201
-It has to be in your mouth.

497
00:27:16,203 --> 00:27:18,538
You have to suck it in
while I'm lighting it.

498
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,640
-Okay. Okay.

499
00:27:20,975 --> 00:27:22,207
-You need to suck.

500
00:27:22,209 --> 00:27:24,211
-I'm sucking.
-You have to try to suck it in.

501
00:27:25,946 --> 00:27:28,282
There you go.
Nice. Good job.

502
00:27:31,752 --> 00:27:34,088
-Kind of tingles your nose.

503
00:27:51,506 --> 00:27:52,740
This feels right.

504
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:55,407
-That can't be true.

505
00:27:55,409 --> 00:27:57,378
It looks incredibly
awkward.

506
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,048
-No, I'm a smoker now.

507
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,617
-Whatever you say, lady.

508
00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:06,153
For sure.

509
00:28:13,562 --> 00:28:16,061
We don't need
any of those.

510
00:28:16,063 --> 00:28:18,665
-No. Why do they sell
them so green?

511
00:28:18,667 --> 00:28:20,766
I wonder why they put them
in plastic bags.

512
00:28:20,768 --> 00:28:22,069
-Do you like Bill?

513
00:28:24,171 --> 00:28:25,806
-Yeah. He's cool.

514
00:28:26,774 --> 00:28:28,909
-Yeah. Yeah, he's cool.

515
00:28:29,511 --> 00:28:31,109
Right?
Yeah.

516
00:28:31,111 --> 00:28:32,179
I'm sorry.

517
00:28:32,446 --> 00:28:35,080
He can just be off-putting to
a lot of my female friends.

518
00:28:35,082 --> 00:28:38,052
And he's kind of
like a dog in that way.

519
00:28:39,153 --> 00:28:40,819
He's in a really cool band.

520
00:28:40,821 --> 00:28:42,122
He's a guitarist.

521
00:28:42,657 --> 00:28:45,057
His band Sleepy Eyes
is, like, amazing.

522
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:46,528
You'd love them.

523
00:28:46,994 --> 00:28:48,729
-I'd love to learn
how to play the guitar.

524
00:28:49,063 --> 00:28:50,297
-Oh, you should have
him teach you.

525
00:28:51,031 --> 00:28:53,968
-Oh no. I don't want
to take up his time.

526
00:28:55,202 --> 00:28:56,337
-Okay.

527
00:28:58,506 --> 00:29:02,544
-I mean, unless he wanted to.

528
00:29:03,344 --> 00:29:04,445
-You know, I write songs too.

529
00:29:04,745 --> 00:29:05,879
-Really?

530
00:29:06,113 --> 00:29:08,115
-I was a creative writing major
at Bard.

531
00:29:08,983 --> 00:29:11,416
And I've actually written a
couple of songs to give to Bill.

532
00:29:11,418 --> 00:29:13,553
But, like, he, like, doesn't
take it seriously.

533
00:29:13,555 --> 00:29:15,990
And then when I play it for him,
he just tells me it's bad.

534
00:29:16,591 --> 00:29:18,660
And it's like, it's my art.

535
00:29:19,093 --> 00:29:20,325
Like who gives a shit.

536
00:29:20,327 --> 00:29:21,529
-I draw!

537
00:29:22,296 --> 00:29:23,397
-What?

538
00:29:23,598 --> 00:29:25,330
-That's like, my thing.

539
00:29:25,332 --> 00:29:28,035
I like to draw cartoons and

540
00:29:28,369 --> 00:29:30,135
and comics and stuff.

541
00:29:30,137 --> 00:29:31,606
-Yeah, I know.

542
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,240
You're really talented.

543
00:29:33,307 --> 00:29:34,576
You leave your door
open so I

544
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:36,208
see it all.

545
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,378
-It's just...

546
00:29:37,545 --> 00:29:40,080
I thought we were talking about
our artistic endeavors.

547
00:29:41,181 --> 00:29:42,249
Wait. Sorry.

548
00:29:42,916 --> 00:29:43,984
You think I'm talented?

549
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:46,787
-It doesn't matter what I think.

550
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:49,323
-Oh.

551
00:29:49,524 --> 00:29:50,922
-No. It really doesn't matter
what I think.

552
00:29:50,924 --> 00:29:51,923
Seriously.

553
00:29:51,925 --> 00:29:53,762
If it feels good
then just do it.

554
00:29:54,194 --> 00:29:55,329
Okay?

555
00:29:55,396 --> 00:29:56,895
Do it until you fucking die.

556
00:29:56,897 --> 00:29:59,400
And they have to unclench
the pen from your lifeless fist.

557
00:30:00,968 --> 00:30:02,036
Trust me.

558
00:30:02,136 --> 00:30:04,138
And the money will come later.
It always does.

559
00:30:04,872 --> 00:30:06,073
And follow your heart.

560
00:30:06,641 --> 00:30:07,776
Or whatever.

561
00:30:11,045 --> 00:30:13,847
God, these avocados are all
so fucking hard.

562
00:30:14,749 --> 00:30:15,849
Why are they always hard?

563
00:30:18,886 --> 00:30:21,221
Why is life so fucking
difficult sometimes?

564
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,630
-This one's good.

565
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,567
You sure you don't want
another slice?

566
00:30:34,569 --> 00:30:36,504
-Thank you. No no no.
I already had one.

567
00:30:36,671 --> 00:30:37,770
I'm okay.

568
00:30:37,772 --> 00:30:38,870
Thank you.

569
00:30:38,872 --> 00:30:40,307
What's your name again?

570
00:30:40,775 --> 00:30:42,007
-Sorry, what?

571
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:43,075
-What is your name?

572
00:30:43,077 --> 00:30:44,242
-Oh, Lisa.

573
00:30:44,244 --> 00:30:45,277
I forgot.
I'm really bad with names.

574
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,079
-No, it's okay. Lisa.
-She just moved here.

575
00:30:47,081 --> 00:30:49,047
Okay. No, I'm not the one
you got to worry about.

576
00:30:49,049 --> 00:30:51,718
It's really dry.
It's really... too dry.

577
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,851
-It's just not dirty enough
for you?

578
00:30:52,853 --> 00:30:54,219
-It's not dirty.
I want it dirty.

579
00:30:54,221 --> 00:30:55,657
-How long have you actually
been here?

580
00:30:56,924 --> 00:30:58,158
-Almost two months now.

581
00:30:58,626 --> 00:31:00,425
-Okay.
So you like the cold?

582
00:31:00,427 --> 00:31:02,260
-Oh, I love it.
So much better than Florida.

583
00:31:02,262 --> 00:31:03,328
-Yeah. I can imagine.

584
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:04,363
-Why?

585
00:31:04,365 --> 00:31:06,098
-Nicole, this lasagna's amazing.

586
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,934
-Thank you. I mean, I can't
believe it's just vegan cheese.

587
00:31:08,936 --> 00:31:10,670
-This is vegan?

588
00:31:10,672 --> 00:31:11,771
-Yeah.

589
00:31:11,773 --> 00:31:12,971
This is a vegan dinner.

590
00:31:12,973 --> 00:31:14,439
Oh!

591
00:31:14,441 --> 00:31:15,643
Okay. Cool.

592
00:31:20,481 --> 00:31:21,982
-So why isn't Cindy here?

593
00:31:22,751 --> 00:31:24,983
-So what do you guys
do for fun around here?

594
00:31:24,985 --> 00:31:27,722
-Oh, uh, what do you mean?

595
00:31:28,389 --> 00:31:30,190
-Like, what do you do in
your free time?

596
00:31:30,424 --> 00:31:32,861
I'm just trying to find some
fun New York things to do.

597
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,130
-There's a shuffle board place
down the street.

598
00:31:37,532 --> 00:31:40,668
-I mean, we do this.
Vegan dinners, right?

599
00:31:40,802 --> 00:31:43,337
-Right. But you could
do that anywhere.

600
00:31:44,104 --> 00:31:45,872
Like, what are some

601
00:31:45,874 --> 00:31:48,610
really New York specific
kind of things?

602
00:31:48,743 --> 00:31:51,111
-I don't... like what?

603
00:31:51,813 --> 00:31:52,913
-Bridges...

604
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,346
-I don't know.

605
00:31:54,348 --> 00:31:56,751
I guess that's why I'm asking.

606
00:31:57,552 --> 00:31:59,953
-Well, I usually just write.

607
00:32:00,254 --> 00:32:01,455
It's kind of what I do.

608
00:32:01,689 --> 00:32:05,725
I've actually got my third novel
almost ready to be published.

609
00:32:05,727 --> 00:32:07,192
-Wow!

610
00:32:07,194 --> 00:32:10,195
-I already have two
already published.

611
00:32:10,197 --> 00:32:11,196
You know, under my belt.

612
00:32:11,198 --> 00:32:13,465
So I'm very excited.
-That's so cool.

613
00:32:13,467 --> 00:32:15,469
Like, can I ask what
they're about?

614
00:32:16,638 --> 00:32:19,204
-It's a YA novel.
With vampires.

615
00:32:19,206 --> 00:32:20,372
-Oh!

616
00:32:20,374 --> 00:32:22,974
-Hey, hasn't that
already been done before?

617
00:32:22,976 --> 00:32:25,545
-I mean, I had this idea
way before Twilight.

618
00:32:25,547 --> 00:32:26,712
You know,

619
00:32:26,714 --> 00:32:29,281
I can't imagine having published
one book.

620
00:32:29,283 --> 00:32:30,552
Let alone three!
So...

621
00:32:31,018 --> 00:32:32,150
They're so good,
by the way.

622
00:32:32,152 --> 00:32:33,454
I mean, self-published.
But...

623
00:32:34,622 --> 00:32:35,857
-They're self-published.

624
00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:39,259
-Published is published.

625
00:32:43,197 --> 00:32:44,264
So, Joel.

626
00:32:45,533 --> 00:32:46,732
How are your studies?

627
00:32:46,734 --> 00:32:47,867
-Really good.

628
00:32:47,869 --> 00:32:50,137
I'm actually almost done,
finally.

629
00:32:50,605 --> 00:32:51,906
Oh, you're
still in school?

630
00:32:52,139 --> 00:32:53,271
Oh my God,
she's interested.

631
00:32:53,273 --> 00:32:54,372
-Yeah.

632
00:32:54,374 --> 00:32:55,777
He's actually
getting his PhD.

633
00:32:56,143 --> 00:32:57,377
-Oh!
Okay, yeah.

634
00:32:58,178 --> 00:32:59,681
Oh, so you're, like,
going to be a doctor.

635
00:33:00,682 --> 00:33:01,848
-Yeah.

636
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:03,248
I'm going to be a
cinema doctor.

637
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,686
-What?

638
00:33:05,152 --> 00:33:06,453
-I'm going to be a...

639
00:33:06,621 --> 00:33:07,720
a doctor of cinema.

640
00:33:07,722 --> 00:33:08,957
Yeah.

641
00:33:09,624 --> 00:33:10,991
I'm going to be

642
00:33:11,291 --> 00:33:13,793
I'm going to get
a PhD in cinema studies.

643
00:33:13,795 --> 00:33:15,028
Yeah, I'm going to be
a doctor in cinema.

644
00:33:15,663 --> 00:33:16,963
-And Joel,
remind me,

645
00:33:16,965 --> 00:33:18,265
what are you going to
do with that degree?

646
00:33:19,567 --> 00:33:21,834
-I am going to teach
film studies.

647
00:33:21,836 --> 00:33:22,869
Obviously.

648
00:33:22,871 --> 00:33:23,970
-Right. Right.

649
00:33:23,972 --> 00:33:25,270
Cool!

650
00:33:25,272 --> 00:33:27,007
-What are you going to do with
your degree?

651
00:33:28,877 --> 00:33:30,578
-You know what I love?

652
00:33:31,078 --> 00:33:32,277
Hitchcock.

653
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:33,345
-I've heard of him.

654
00:33:33,347 --> 00:33:34,514
It's a great movie.

655
00:33:34,516 --> 00:33:35,648
The Lady Vanishes.

656
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:36,716
-Rear Window.

657
00:33:36,718 --> 00:33:37,917
-Lady Vanishes.

658
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:39,317
- Ropes.
- Birds.

659
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:40,452
-Birds!

660
00:33:40,454 --> 00:33:42,724
-You know what happened
with that actress?

661
00:33:43,056 --> 00:33:44,289
-The bird?

662
00:33:44,291 --> 00:33:45,459
-Such a jerk to her.

663
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,697
So, how's
living with Holly?

664
00:33:50,497 --> 00:33:53,400
-It's um... interesting.

665
00:33:53,668 --> 00:33:54,800
Never a dull moment.

666
00:33:54,802 --> 00:33:57,237
-Yeah.
She's a riot, for sure.

667
00:33:58,673 --> 00:34:00,940
-Doesn't care about money
or any of that stuff.

668
00:34:00,942 --> 00:34:03,009
She just lives her life
how it should be.

669
00:34:03,011 --> 00:34:04,175
You know?

670
00:34:04,177 --> 00:34:05,343
In the moment.

671
00:34:05,345 --> 00:34:07,680
It's honestly inspiring.

672
00:34:07,682 --> 00:34:09,017
-Um-hum.

673
00:34:09,249 --> 00:34:11,351
-Just knowing the money will
come when it comes, you know?

674
00:34:12,252 --> 00:34:13,385
-Yeah.

675
00:34:13,387 --> 00:34:14,689
No. Um...

676
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:16,121
I mean, like,

677
00:34:16,123 --> 00:34:17,523
the money's coming now

678
00:34:17,525 --> 00:34:18,826
already, but...

679
00:34:19,527 --> 00:34:20,862
It'll come later too, right?

680
00:34:22,362 --> 00:34:23,865
-What do you mean?

681
00:34:24,097 --> 00:34:25,299
-You know.

682
00:34:28,101 --> 00:34:30,937
Her dad invested in, like,
Amazon or some shit

683
00:34:30,939 --> 00:34:32,237
really early on.

684
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,141
Her parents are mad rich.

685
00:34:34,408 --> 00:34:36,343
How do you think she affords
to live here?

686
00:34:36,978 --> 00:34:38,143
-I don't know.

687
00:34:38,145 --> 00:34:40,046
I guess I thought it was
the Etsy shop.

688
00:34:40,048 --> 00:34:41,212
-Girl.

689
00:34:41,214 --> 00:34:42,280
She sells, like, what?

690
00:34:42,282 --> 00:34:44,650
One or two things
a month on that, max.

691
00:34:44,652 --> 00:34:48,623
I mean, have you seen
her designs?

692
00:34:48,923 --> 00:34:50,890
Alexa!
Play Nickelback.

693
00:34:50,892 --> 00:34:51,993
No!
What?

694
00:34:53,861 --> 00:34:55,861
Alexa, stop!

695
00:34:55,863 --> 00:34:57,329
Alexa!

696
00:34:57,331 --> 00:35:00,034
- Fuck.
- I shouldn't have said that.

697
00:35:00,367 --> 00:35:01,499
I didn't mean it like that.

698
00:35:01,501 --> 00:35:03,636
I mean, I did.

699
00:35:03,638 --> 00:35:05,037
I meant what I said.

700
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:06,137
But I shouldn't have said it.

701
00:35:06,139 --> 00:35:08,173
It was shitty.
And she's my friend.

702
00:35:08,175 --> 00:35:10,308
And I support her.

703
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:11,544
And...

704
00:35:11,546 --> 00:35:12,945
It's like

705
00:35:12,947 --> 00:35:14,379
they're simple pieces.

706
00:35:14,381 --> 00:35:16,114
But simple things, you know,

707
00:35:16,116 --> 00:35:18,385
they have more longevity, right?
Like...

708
00:35:19,419 --> 00:35:21,520
I don't want to
have this argument right now.

709
00:35:21,522 --> 00:35:22,688
Oh, you think I do?

710
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:23,889
-I mean, you're the one
instigating.

711
00:35:23,891 --> 00:35:26,224
-NO.
You have to be fucking joking.

712
00:35:26,226 --> 00:35:27,593
I hate arguing.

713
00:35:27,595 --> 00:35:28,761
-No you don't.

714
00:35:28,763 --> 00:35:29,895
-Yes, I do.

715
00:35:29,897 --> 00:35:30,997
-I hate arguing.

716
00:35:30,999 --> 00:35:33,264
-Are we seriously
doing this right now?

717
00:35:33,266 --> 00:35:34,499
-We aren't doing anything.

718
00:35:34,501 --> 00:35:36,267
You are the one.

719
00:35:36,269 --> 00:35:38,104
-No!
We're doing this together.

720
00:35:38,106 --> 00:35:40,372
I can't just argue with myself!

721
00:35:40,374 --> 00:35:43,042
-You're being such a cunt
right now, Holly.

722
00:35:48,148 --> 00:35:50,918
Did you seriously
just fucking hit me?

723
00:35:54,321 --> 00:35:55,554
God damn it!

724
00:35:55,556 --> 00:35:57,790
It's right in front of
the bathroom door.

725
00:35:57,792 --> 00:35:59,058
I'm not cleaning that up.

726
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,225
-Fuck!
Neither am I!

727
00:36:00,227 --> 00:36:01,393
-Alright.
-Okay.

728
00:36:01,395 --> 00:36:02,494
Goodnight.

729
00:36:02,496 --> 00:36:03,731
-Goodnight.

730
00:36:05,232 --> 00:36:06,464
Aren't you having fun?

731
00:36:06,466 --> 00:36:07,499
Isn't this fun?

732
00:36:07,501 --> 00:36:08,701
-Yeah.

733
00:36:08,703 --> 00:36:09,737
You know, I feel like when
something's fun,

734
00:36:09,871 --> 00:36:11,236
you don't really have to ask.
It's just, you know.

735
00:36:11,238 --> 00:36:12,337
Kind of a given that...

736
00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:13,539
-You're not enjoying yourself?

737
00:36:13,541 --> 00:36:14,640
-No, I am.
I am.

738
00:36:14,642 --> 00:36:16,276
It's just, I think, maybe

739
00:36:16,778 --> 00:36:19,113
skating's not really my thing.

740
00:36:19,279 --> 00:36:20,846
-But it's so New York.

741
00:36:20,848 --> 00:36:22,014
-It is.
It's very New York.

742
00:36:22,016 --> 00:36:23,417
Yep.

743
00:36:24,085 --> 00:36:26,217
-I'm just glad to be out of
the apartment, honestly.

744
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:27,318
-Yeah.

745
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,623
At least they haven't
murdered you yet.

746
00:36:29,256 --> 00:36:30,488
I'm going to sit down.

747
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:31,826
-But

748
00:36:32,259 --> 00:36:34,529
they're going to end up
murdering each other.

749
00:36:34,662 --> 00:36:36,263
-Yeah.

750
00:36:36,831 --> 00:36:38,097
-They fight all the time.

751
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:39,497
It is exhausting.

752
00:36:39,499 --> 00:36:42,070
They literally argue
about everything.

753
00:36:42,537 --> 00:36:44,302
It's so distracting.

754
00:36:44,304 --> 00:36:45,403
I can't draw.
I can't eat.

755
00:36:45,405 --> 00:36:46,507
I can't sleep.

756
00:36:46,574 --> 00:36:48,042
I can't even leave my room
without feeling like

757
00:36:49,077 --> 00:36:49,975
I'm entering a fucking
battlefield.

758
00:36:49,977 --> 00:36:51,344
-Yeah...

759
00:36:52,714 --> 00:36:53,979
-I'm so sorry.

760
00:36:53,981 --> 00:36:55,181
-It's okay.

761
00:36:55,183 --> 00:36:56,949
It's just,
I can't wait to live with you!

762
00:36:56,951 --> 00:36:58,786
-Yeah...

763
00:37:04,992 --> 00:37:06,393
Can we talk about something?

764
00:37:07,829 --> 00:37:09,061
-Yeah.

765
00:37:09,063 --> 00:37:10,162
Are we not talking right now?

766
00:37:10,164 --> 00:37:11,331
-No, yeah, we are.

767
00:37:13,601 --> 00:37:14,834
I guess what I wanted
to say was

768
00:37:14,836 --> 00:37:16,137
I think that

769
00:37:16,204 --> 00:37:19,907
You know, we've reached a point
in our relationship where...

770
00:37:21,509 --> 00:37:23,341
Look, we spent a lot of time
together in college, right?

771
00:37:23,343 --> 00:37:24,442
And that was really great.

772
00:37:24,444 --> 00:37:25,747
Like, that was really great.

773
00:37:25,847 --> 00:37:27,012
And then I moved to New York.

774
00:37:27,014 --> 00:37:28,279
And it's like,

775
00:37:28,281 --> 00:37:30,518
you know, we had this
distance thing going on.

776
00:37:30,818 --> 00:37:32,987
And that space, I feel like,
maybe was...

777
00:37:34,555 --> 00:37:36,021
I think it was really good
for us.

778
00:37:36,023 --> 00:37:37,625
You know what I mean?

779
00:37:38,291 --> 00:37:39,592
-No.

780
00:37:39,594 --> 00:37:41,162
-It's like...

781
00:37:41,729 --> 00:37:43,330
Fuck. I thought that
was going to suffice.

782
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:46,498
I mean, don't you feel like
we're drifting?

783
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,600
Well,

784
00:37:47,602 --> 00:37:49,702
we don't spend
that much time together.

785
00:37:49,704 --> 00:37:51,302
But that's because
you're always busy.

786
00:37:51,304 --> 00:37:52,638
-Right!
Yeah, I am busy.

787
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,039
Exactly.

788
00:37:54,041 --> 00:37:55,406
And I guess that's
what I'm saying.

789
00:37:55,408 --> 00:37:57,011
I mean, it kind of feels like
I have

790
00:37:59,147 --> 00:38:00,915
you know, my own cool life.

791
00:38:07,155 --> 00:38:08,823
-Do you not want to
live together anymore?

792
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:13,795
Are you breaking up with me?

793
00:38:14,061 --> 00:38:15,261
-No, no.
No.

794
00:38:15,263 --> 00:38:16,394
I'm not...

795
00:38:16,396 --> 00:38:17,963
Not unless you wanted to
break up or something.

796
00:38:17,965 --> 00:38:19,098
-What?

797
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,365
What?
What?

798
00:38:20,367 --> 00:38:21,499
-Do you want to break up?

799
00:38:21,501 --> 00:38:22,904
-No!
I just said "no."

800
00:38:25,573 --> 00:38:26,774
Look...

801
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,708
You know, you got your whole
"plan without a plan" thing

802
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:30,910
going on.
And I'm...

803
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,111
trying to, like,

804
00:38:32,113 --> 00:38:33,612
get ahead in my career. You know

805
00:38:33,614 --> 00:38:35,382
-Eric, you're a barista.

806
00:38:36,617 --> 00:38:37,952
-I could be the best barista.

807
00:38:42,657 --> 00:38:44,089
Look, I'm sorry.

808
00:38:44,091 --> 00:38:45,224
I just don't like feeling bad

809
00:38:45,226 --> 00:38:46,324
every time you ask me
to hang out

810
00:38:46,326 --> 00:38:48,160
and I can't because I'm busy
or I'm tired

811
00:38:48,162 --> 00:38:49,394
or I'm with other people.

812
00:38:49,396 --> 00:38:50,865
It's just...

813
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:53,668
-But I don't know anyone else.

814
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:56,938
-So why'd you move here?

815
00:39:01,576 --> 00:39:02,877
Hey.

816
00:39:03,144 --> 00:39:04,612
What are you doing?

817
00:39:06,647 --> 00:39:07,913
Lisa, I don't think you
can lay on this.

818
00:39:07,915 --> 00:39:09,349
It's nice stone.

819
00:39:10,184 --> 00:39:11,351
-It doesn't matter.

820
00:39:14,722 --> 00:39:15,990
-Lisa, people are staring.

821
00:39:16,991 --> 00:39:18,491
-I don't care.

822
00:39:24,732 --> 00:39:26,131
Wait!
Where are you going?

823
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:27,268
-Huh? What?

824
00:39:28,169 --> 00:39:29,402
-Where are you going?

825
00:39:30,571 --> 00:39:32,006
-Didn't we just break up?

826
00:40:19,153 --> 00:40:21,055
Come here!
Come here!

827
00:40:27,595 --> 00:40:29,429
May I have this dance?

828
00:40:30,463 --> 00:40:31,599
-Yes.

829
00:40:33,701 --> 00:40:35,369
Oh fuck.
-Oh shit, oh shit.

830
00:40:38,673 --> 00:40:40,739
-I like this song.

831
00:40:40,741 --> 00:40:42,041
-It's good, right?

832
00:40:42,043 --> 00:40:44,677
This is Bill's band!

833
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:45,511
-What?

834
00:40:45,513 --> 00:40:46,914
-Yes, bitch!

835
00:40:49,083 --> 00:40:50,518
-What's going on in here?

836
00:40:51,352 --> 00:40:52,851
-Hi, baby.

837
00:40:52,853 --> 00:40:53,988
-Hey, babe.

838
00:40:55,723 --> 00:41:00,428
-Lisa's just being a strong,
independent woman.

839
00:41:00,795 --> 00:41:02,163
-Oh yeah?

840
00:41:02,997 --> 00:41:04,464
I'll take that.

841
00:41:05,166 --> 00:41:06,300
-Oh.

842
00:41:09,737 --> 00:41:11,639
Come here, baby.

843
00:41:16,877 --> 00:41:18,446
Bill, come here.

844
00:41:19,413 --> 00:41:21,282
-I don't want to make
anybody uncomfortable.

845
00:41:21,916 --> 00:41:23,782
-We're family.

846
00:41:23,784 --> 00:41:25,419
No one's uncomfortable.

847
00:41:27,388 --> 00:41:28,689
Come.

848
00:41:34,395 --> 00:41:35,495
Yeah.

849
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:39,767
-So, what's going on?

850
00:41:41,035 --> 00:41:42,903
-Lisa's single.

851
00:41:46,607 --> 00:41:47,873
-Guess that's good.

852
00:41:47,875 --> 00:41:49,174
Is it good?

853
00:41:49,176 --> 00:41:50,275
-Yeah, yeah.

854
00:41:50,277 --> 00:41:52,246
I'm perfect, honestly.

855
00:41:54,415 --> 00:41:56,017
-We're here for you.

856
00:41:57,184 --> 00:41:58,586
You know that, right?

857
00:42:29,383 --> 00:42:31,252
Get Go Travel Agency?

858
00:42:33,788 --> 00:42:36,657
Um, yes.
Please hold.

859
00:42:38,259 --> 00:42:39,360
They want to talk to an agent.

860
00:42:39,727 --> 00:42:41,195
-Really?

861
00:42:42,296 --> 00:42:43,864
-Really?

862
00:42:45,566 --> 00:42:47,435
-Okay, yeah.
Sure.

863
00:42:47,668 --> 00:42:48,836
Okay.
Hold on.

864
00:42:52,673 --> 00:42:53,874
This is Sean.

865
00:42:55,876 --> 00:42:57,111
Yes?

866
00:42:59,447 --> 00:43:00,815
Uh-huh.

867
00:43:03,084 --> 00:43:06,118
Yeah, I mean, we can definitely,
definitely do that for you.

868
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,488
Absolutely.
Not a problem.

869
00:43:08,355 --> 00:43:09,522
Right.

870
00:43:09,524 --> 00:43:10,891
No, absolutely.

871
00:43:12,193 --> 00:43:14,061
Thank you so much.
Yeah, yeah, perfect.

872
00:43:15,463 --> 00:43:16,695
I'll talk to you then.

873
00:43:16,697 --> 00:43:17,932
Okay.
Have a nice day.

874
00:43:18,799 --> 00:43:20,132
Dude!

875
00:43:20,134 --> 00:43:21,268
I just made a sale.

876
00:43:21,769 --> 00:43:23,404
Lisa, I just made a sale.

877
00:43:25,005 --> 00:43:26,373
That was easy.

878
00:43:27,608 --> 00:43:29,276
This is an easy job.

879
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:51,697
So that's the G.

880
00:43:51,699 --> 00:43:52,900
Now if we move it back

881
00:43:53,467 --> 00:43:55,035
that's a C.

882
00:44:04,678 --> 00:44:06,011
You just go back and forth.

883
00:44:06,013 --> 00:44:07,146
You got a song.

884
00:44:07,148 --> 00:44:08,313
All you need is two chords.

885
00:44:08,315 --> 00:44:09,817
-That's so easy.

886
00:44:10,651 --> 00:44:13,888
-They say it's three chords
but it's two chords, actually.

887
00:44:15,823 --> 00:44:16,989
You want to try?

888
00:44:16,991 --> 00:44:18,157
-Okay.

889
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:19,360
-So you take your hand...

890
00:44:20,761 --> 00:44:22,661
I don't know what's more
comfortable for you.

891
00:44:22,663 --> 00:44:23,996
This one or this one.

892
00:44:23,998 --> 00:44:25,230
Does that feel good?

893
00:44:25,232 --> 00:44:26,767
-Okay.

894
00:44:27,401 --> 00:44:28,836
-You can strum.

895
00:44:32,306 --> 00:44:33,642
To here.

896
00:44:33,674 --> 00:44:34,840
-Okay.

897
00:44:34,842 --> 00:44:36,210
-Try that.

898
00:44:40,649 --> 00:44:41,747
Hey, babe.

899
00:44:41,749 --> 00:44:43,317
-Hey.
What's up?

900
00:44:44,118 --> 00:44:45,252
-How are you?

901
00:44:47,821 --> 00:44:48,989
-What's going on?

902
00:44:49,123 --> 00:44:50,324
-I'm hungry.

903
00:44:50,724 --> 00:44:52,291
-Let's get some tacos?

904
00:44:52,293 --> 00:44:53,492
-Yeah.

905
00:44:53,494 --> 00:44:54,962
Hey, Lisa.

906
00:44:55,597 --> 00:44:56,864
-You're a natural.

907
00:45:40,841 --> 00:45:41,976
Who is it?

908
00:45:46,447 --> 00:45:47,647
Dude.

909
00:45:47,649 --> 00:45:48,849
-Dude.

910
00:45:50,317 --> 00:45:51,618
How are you doing?

911
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:52,784
-I'm good.
How are you?

912
00:45:52,786 --> 00:45:53,954
-Great.

913
00:45:54,121 --> 00:45:55,387
-Hey, Doug.

914
00:45:55,389 --> 00:45:56,522
-How are you?

915
00:45:56,524 --> 00:45:57,659
-Fine.

916
00:45:58,192 --> 00:45:59,491
-It's been forever.

917
00:45:59,493 --> 00:46:00,660
-Yeah.

918
00:46:00,662 --> 00:46:02,261
Bill didn't say you were
coming by.

919
00:46:02,263 --> 00:46:03,764
-Yeah.

920
00:46:03,998 --> 00:46:05,833
Yeah.

921
00:46:05,899 --> 00:46:07,334
-Where are you staying
these days?

922
00:46:08,836 --> 00:46:10,639
-Huh?

923
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:13,706
-Where are you--

924
00:46:13,708 --> 00:46:14,873
-Let me give you
a hand.

925
00:46:14,875 --> 00:46:16,343
-Yeah, where am I staying
these days?

926
00:46:17,811 --> 00:46:19,046
-Where is he staying?

927
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,047
-Come on.
I'll show you the space.

928
00:46:22,049 --> 00:46:23,282
-Thank you, Holly.

929
00:46:23,284 --> 00:46:24,483
Where's your bathroom?

930
00:46:24,485 --> 00:46:26,519
-It's back to the left.

931
00:46:26,521 --> 00:46:27,689
-Cool.

932
00:46:27,921 --> 00:46:29,121
-It's pink.

933
00:46:29,123 --> 00:46:30,659
-Yeah, I'm going to set up
shop in there.

934
00:46:39,233 --> 00:46:40,635
Where do you want him
to stay?

935
00:46:41,335 --> 00:46:42,535
Somewhere fucking else.

936
00:46:42,537 --> 00:46:43,904
So, you're going to live
here now?

937
00:46:44,606 --> 00:46:45,707
-That's what Bill said.

938
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:51,178
-And did he tell you about me?

939
00:46:52,012 --> 00:46:53,147
-Yeah.
He did.

940
00:46:53,914 --> 00:46:55,750
He said I could stay
in the spare room.

941
00:46:57,318 --> 00:46:59,151
I have specific plans
to decorate...

942
00:46:59,153 --> 00:47:00,485
You mean Holly's studio?

943
00:47:00,487 --> 00:47:01,654
You've had plans for years

944
00:47:01,656 --> 00:47:03,055
and all you've done
is paint the bathroom pink.

945
00:47:03,057 --> 00:47:04,191
Ah shit.

946
00:47:05,125 --> 00:47:07,328
-I mean, you're being really
fucking selfish, Holly.

947
00:47:08,128 --> 00:47:11,363
-These rooms are what we agreed
to when we signed the lease.

948
00:47:11,365 --> 00:47:12,632
-We didn't sign a lease!

949
00:47:12,634 --> 00:47:14,134
I signed a lease.

950
00:47:14,868 --> 00:47:16,569
-You're a fucking asshole.

951
00:47:16,571 --> 00:47:17,670
-And you're a fucking...

952
00:47:17,672 --> 00:47:18,972
James Franco fucker!

953
00:47:19,808 --> 00:47:22,474
-Well then how about you
and Doug just share our room.

954
00:47:22,476 --> 00:47:23,712
And I'll move out!

955
00:47:23,911 --> 00:47:25,979
-What would that actually solve?

956
00:47:26,648 --> 00:47:28,449
-I was being facetious.

957
00:47:30,184 --> 00:47:31,883
-I'm glad you said something.

958
00:47:31,885 --> 00:47:33,952
Because I didn't want to say
anything but you are being

959
00:47:33,954 --> 00:47:35,657
kind of a Nazi right now.

960
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,127
-A Nazi?

961
00:47:41,895 --> 00:47:46,298
I said "facetious,"
not "fascist."

962
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:48,502
You fucking idiot.

963
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:52,037
-Whatever.
Same shit.

964
00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:53,171
-No.
No, no, no, no.

965
00:47:53,173 --> 00:47:54,373
It's not.

966
00:47:54,375 --> 00:47:57,144
You just called your girlfriend
a Nazi.

967
00:47:58,847 --> 00:47:59,980
-Well...

968
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,387
I'm sorry.
I wasn't thinking.

969
00:48:07,254 --> 00:48:08,489
-Yeah, that's clear.

970
00:48:08,989 --> 00:48:10,422
-Come on.
I mean...

971
00:48:10,424 --> 00:48:11,624
I'm sorry.

972
00:48:11,626 --> 00:48:12,725
I'm sorry.

973
00:48:12,727 --> 00:48:13,826
-No, don't touch me.

974
00:48:13,828 --> 00:48:15,695
Don't touch--
Don't fucking touch me.

975
00:48:15,697 --> 00:48:17,195
-Come on.

976
00:48:17,197 --> 00:48:18,463
-No!
Get away!

977
00:48:18,465 --> 00:48:19,766
Sit down!

978
00:48:19,768 --> 00:48:21,368
Get away from me.

979
00:48:23,571 --> 00:48:24,739
-Really?

980
00:48:24,972 --> 00:48:26,171
Are you...

981
00:48:26,173 --> 00:48:27,842
Okay.

982
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:35,149
-I'm tired of fighting.

983
00:48:38,586 --> 00:48:39,754
-Yeah.

984
00:48:40,889 --> 00:48:42,322
Me too.

985
00:48:53,367 --> 00:48:54,935
Feels good, right?
It's not bad.

986
00:48:56,738 --> 00:48:57,971
Hey, by the way...

987
00:48:58,573 --> 00:49:00,140
Thank you for this.

988
00:49:00,207 --> 00:49:03,041
Because this bar usually
doesn't card.

989
00:49:03,043 --> 00:49:04,945
But I just didn't want to
risk it.

990
00:49:05,547 --> 00:49:08,115
Like, you never know.
And, like, you know?

991
00:49:09,149 --> 00:49:10,382
-How old are you, again?

992
00:49:10,384 --> 00:49:12,785
-What's your Venmo
so I can get you back for this?

993
00:49:12,787 --> 00:49:14,354
-Don't worry about it.
It's on me.

994
00:49:14,522 --> 00:49:15,822
-Wow.

995
00:49:15,824 --> 00:49:17,057
Thanks.
I'll cheers to that, then.

996
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:18,390
-Cheers.

997
00:49:18,392 --> 00:49:19,527
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

998
00:49:22,664 --> 00:49:24,131
Ah.

999
00:49:24,331 --> 00:49:25,633
That's refreshing.

1000
00:49:27,802 --> 00:49:29,504
-So they just closed
the agency down?

1001
00:49:30,304 --> 00:49:31,436
-So, like,

1002
00:49:31,438 --> 00:49:32,841
my uncle

1003
00:49:32,907 --> 00:49:34,074
funny enough

1004
00:49:34,308 --> 00:49:37,877
he never seemed that interested
in keeping the business open.

1005
00:49:37,879 --> 00:49:39,010
In the first place.

1006
00:49:39,012 --> 00:49:40,414
Like, at all.

1007
00:49:42,115 --> 00:49:44,786
But I'm kind of relieved,
a little bit, because

1008
00:49:45,252 --> 00:49:47,454
I just don't like working.

1009
00:49:47,889 --> 00:49:49,356
-Me neither.

1010
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:53,126
-So what are you going
to do now?

1011
00:49:57,097 --> 00:49:58,330
Well isn't that
how temping works?

1012
00:49:58,332 --> 00:49:59,532
Like, you get a new job,

1013
00:49:59,534 --> 00:50:01,468
and then you kind of hop
around and stuff?

1014
00:50:01,903 --> 00:50:04,806
-Yeah. I don't think I'm going
to keep temping.

1015
00:50:04,906 --> 00:50:07,274
-Oh. Okay.

1016
00:50:07,842 --> 00:50:09,076
Well, what are you going
to do?

1017
00:50:10,344 --> 00:50:11,579
-I don't know.

1018
00:50:11,846 --> 00:50:13,213
I don't even know what I'm
doing here.

1019
00:50:14,481 --> 00:50:15,683
-Well, we're just having
a drink.

1020
00:50:16,784 --> 00:50:17,986
-In New York, Sean.

1021
00:50:21,121 --> 00:50:24,659
I just thought I was going to
have this exciting experience.

1022
00:50:24,859 --> 00:50:27,027
And I could just exist
and be happy.

1023
00:50:27,194 --> 00:50:28,393
But I'm not happy.

1024
00:50:28,395 --> 00:50:30,932
And I don't know why.
Which makes it worse.

1025
00:50:31,398 --> 00:50:33,866
And I was just really,
really hoping

1026
00:50:33,868 --> 00:50:36,470
for, like, some experience,
you know? Like...

1027
00:50:40,207 --> 00:50:41,408
But I don't know what
that means.

1028
00:50:42,577 --> 00:50:44,077
Is New York a place?

1029
00:50:44,612 --> 00:50:46,046
Is it an idea?

1030
00:50:46,948 --> 00:50:48,282
Or is it something deeper?

1031
00:50:49,182 --> 00:50:51,451
Maybe, New York isn't for me.
Maybe...

1032
00:50:52,419 --> 00:50:53,555
I'm not for it.

1033
00:50:55,489 --> 00:50:56,858
-New York's definitely
a place.

1034
00:50:57,825 --> 00:50:59,493
-I should've gone to
grad school.

1035
00:51:01,461 --> 00:51:03,631
Everything makes sense when
you're in college.

1036
00:51:07,401 --> 00:51:08,603
Hey...

1037
00:51:08,703 --> 00:51:10,170
Your school's close by.

1038
00:51:10,437 --> 00:51:13,041
Why don't we go and
check out the campus for fun.

1039
00:51:14,141 --> 00:51:16,408
-New York University, like NYU,

1040
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:18,046
doesn't actually have a campus.

1041
00:51:19,346 --> 00:51:20,515
-Oh.

1042
00:51:24,084 --> 00:51:25,352
-But we do have dorms.

1043
00:51:31,291 --> 00:51:32,392
Okay...

1044
00:51:33,327 --> 00:51:34,494
So this is it.

1045
00:51:35,029 --> 00:51:36,163
This is my spot.

1046
00:51:39,466 --> 00:51:42,704
Oh, let me get rid
of this shit.

1047
00:51:44,672 --> 00:51:46,406
-Where are your sheets?

1048
00:51:47,374 --> 00:51:48,473
-They are somewhere--

1049
00:51:48,475 --> 00:51:50,210
They're around here somewhere.

1050
00:51:56,651 --> 00:51:59,087
So does this remind you
of your college days?

1051
00:52:01,723 --> 00:52:02,989
-Yeah.

1052
00:52:02,991 --> 00:52:04,191
Unfortunately.

1053
00:52:06,094 --> 00:52:07,795
It's not that bad, right?
It's like...

1054
00:52:27,615 --> 00:52:29,216
Yo Sean!

1055
00:52:30,084 --> 00:52:31,182
-Dude, get out of here!

1056
00:52:31,184 --> 00:52:32,350
What are you doing?

1057
00:52:32,352 --> 00:52:33,621
-I'm sorry.
You're door was unlocked.

1058
00:52:33,955 --> 00:52:35,657
-That's not a reason
for you to come in!

1059
00:52:36,624 --> 00:52:38,557
Lisa, don't go.

1060
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:39,725
-I have to go anyway.

1061
00:52:39,727 --> 00:52:40,860
-I'm sorry, Sean.

1062
00:52:40,862 --> 00:52:42,096
And you're very pretty!

1063
00:52:49,403 --> 00:52:50,905
Was that a grad student?

1064
00:53:27,942 --> 00:53:31,077
It just became
clear to me.

1065
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:34,982
That, like, he doesn't give
a shit about me.

1066
00:53:35,817 --> 00:53:37,415
Like, nothing else matters.

1067
00:53:37,417 --> 00:53:38,619
I'm just there.

1068
00:53:39,087 --> 00:53:40,855
And he only cares about himself.

1069
00:53:41,756 --> 00:53:44,289
I've wasted so much
time and money on him.

1070
00:53:44,291 --> 00:53:46,694
Like, I could be traveling
the world right now.

1071
00:53:48,029 --> 00:53:49,697
-Do you want to be traveling
the world right now?

1072
00:53:50,531 --> 00:53:51,864
-Ew. No.

1073
00:53:51,866 --> 00:53:53,032
But...

1074
00:53:53,034 --> 00:53:55,467
The point is I could be
traveling right now.

1075
00:53:55,469 --> 00:53:56,871
He's suffocating me!

1076
00:53:59,073 --> 00:54:01,008
-Maybe you should see what life
is like without him.

1077
00:54:02,476 --> 00:54:03,711
-You think we should

1078
00:54:03,978 --> 00:54:05,146
break up?

1079
00:54:06,246 --> 00:54:07,380
-Do you want my honest opinion?

1080
00:54:10,651 --> 00:54:11,786
Then yes.

1081
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,988
Yes, you absolutely should.

1082
00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:17,959
That's my opinion.

1083
00:54:18,993 --> 00:54:20,161
If you want it, I mean.

1084
00:54:25,066 --> 00:54:26,299
-You smoke?

1085
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:51,859
I'm sorry.

1086
00:54:59,133 --> 00:55:00,735
-It's okay.

1087
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:09,577
-The fountain's usually on.

1088
00:55:15,382 --> 00:55:16,649
One, two, three!

1089
00:56:51,411 --> 00:56:52,580
They have...

1090
00:56:55,549 --> 00:56:56,749
I really want beer.

1091
00:56:56,751 --> 00:56:58,052
-What the fuck
is this?

1092
00:56:58,853 --> 00:57:01,454
I think this is
some sort of lemonade.

1093
00:57:02,723 --> 00:57:04,725
I don't even think there's
any alcohol in this.

1094
00:57:06,493 --> 00:57:07,726
I hate beer.

1095
00:57:07,728 --> 00:57:09,330
-Really?

1096
00:57:10,197 --> 00:57:11,599
-Do you want any?

1097
00:57:11,933 --> 00:57:13,098
You seem to like it.

1098
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:14,268
-No, it's okay.

1099
00:57:22,643 --> 00:57:23,744
Cool.

1100
00:57:26,446 --> 00:57:28,015
Yeah, he's great.

1101
00:57:44,565 --> 00:57:46,165
We saw it at
the same time.

1102
00:57:46,167 --> 00:57:47,866
-We walked in but
my eyes made contact.

1103
00:57:47,868 --> 00:57:50,468
-But what if we
sliced it in four so the...

1104
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:52,171
-I don't know.

1105
00:57:52,173 --> 00:57:53,605
I think that's not fair.

1106
00:57:53,607 --> 00:57:54,873
-Um, no.

1107
00:57:54,875 --> 00:57:56,577
Yeah, we're not allowed
on the roof.

1108
00:57:58,179 --> 00:57:59,545
-Are you sure?
I've seen--

1109
00:57:59,547 --> 00:58:00,879
-Yes, it's against...

1110
00:58:00,881 --> 00:58:02,247
We're not allowed on the roof.

1111
00:58:02,249 --> 00:58:03,951
You're not allowed on the roof.

1112
00:58:04,986 --> 00:58:06,552
-Well, Bill said sometimes
you guys go up--

1113
00:58:06,554 --> 00:58:07,820
-Yeah, well, Bill doesn't know

1114
00:58:07,822 --> 00:58:09,455
what the fuck
he's talking about.

1115
00:58:09,457 --> 00:58:10,923
Okay?

1116
00:58:10,925 --> 00:58:12,560
-Well, I'm just trying to get
a bunch of...

1117
00:58:12,793 --> 00:58:14,161
I'm trying to get
a group together.

1118
00:58:14,662 --> 00:58:16,597
Maybe go up on the roof.
Look at the skyline.

1119
00:58:18,032 --> 00:58:19,300
-Fine.

1120
00:58:19,467 --> 00:58:21,934
Yeah, yeah. Go have fun
in your apartment.

1121
00:58:21,936 --> 00:58:23,235
-Okay.

1122
00:58:23,237 --> 00:58:24,772

-Okay, okay.

1131
00:59:09,717 --> 00:59:12,820
-Have you never seen the Ken
Burns country music documentary?

1132
00:59:15,756 --> 00:59:17,022
I don't come.

1133
00:59:17,024 --> 00:59:18,791
Every time.
It's fool-proof!

1134
00:59:18,793 --> 00:59:21,427
But it does make sex
unenjoyable.

1135
00:59:21,429 --> 00:59:23,362
But, you know.
Ebb and flow.

1136
00:59:23,364 --> 00:59:24,732
You know, I don't enjoy sex.

1137
00:59:25,132 --> 00:59:26,801
I never come.

1138
00:59:27,735 --> 00:59:29,003
-Sorry.

1139
00:59:31,572 --> 00:59:33,707
Hey. Hey.

1140
00:59:33,841 --> 00:59:35,340
-What are you doing here?

1141
00:59:35,342 --> 00:59:36,610
-I don't know.

1142
00:59:39,013 --> 00:59:40,214
I miss you.

1143
00:59:40,481 --> 00:59:41,947
-You've got issues dude.

1144
00:59:41,949 --> 00:59:43,651
-I know. I'm sorry.

1145
00:59:44,752 --> 00:59:45,920
-You hurt me.

1146
00:59:48,289 --> 00:59:49,855
-I didn't lay a finger on you.

1147
00:59:49,857 --> 00:59:51,023
-Emotionally, I mean.

1148
00:59:51,025 --> 00:59:52,257
-Oh.

1149
00:59:52,259 --> 00:59:53,727
Yeah, okay.

1150
00:59:54,995 --> 00:59:56,529
I don't know.
Do you want to go...

1151
00:59:56,531 --> 00:59:58,531
We could go to your bedroom
and we could talk this out.

1152
00:59:58,533 --> 00:59:59,698
I mean...

1153
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:01,001
-No.

1154
01:00:02,470 --> 01:00:04,171
-Do you want to talk
about it here?

1155
01:00:05,339 --> 01:00:07,108
-No, I just don't
want to talk about it.

1156
01:00:08,042 --> 01:00:09,308
-I said I was sorry.

1157
01:00:09,310 --> 01:00:11,110
-I know, I heard you
the first time.

1158
01:00:11,112 --> 01:00:12,514
I just don't believe you.

1159
01:00:13,314 --> 01:00:15,247
-Why else would I walk
all the way over here?

1160
01:00:15,249 --> 01:00:16,348
I walked here.

1161
01:00:16,350 --> 01:00:18,383
-Because you're
lonely and horny.

1162
01:00:18,385 --> 01:00:19,952
I don't know.

1163
01:00:19,954 --> 01:00:21,153
Look...

1164
01:00:21,155 --> 01:00:22,788
I don't blame you for
breaking up with me.

1165
01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:25,292
I just wish you had done it
before I moved to New York.

1166
01:00:26,561 --> 01:00:28,327
-You're the one that said moving
to New York had nothing

1167
01:00:28,329 --> 01:00:29,430
to do with me.

1168
01:00:29,564 --> 01:00:31,029
-Well, yeah but it still
would've been nice to know

1169
01:00:31,031 --> 01:00:32,399
before I moved here.

1170
01:00:35,035 --> 01:00:36,435
Dude.

1171
01:00:36,437 --> 01:00:38,472
-What?
-No!

1172
01:00:39,006 --> 01:00:40,839
-It's just, we're standing here,
there's no one else around--

1173
01:00:40,841 --> 01:00:42,209
-No. But you know...

1174
01:00:42,544 --> 01:00:43,978
This is not the moment.

1175
01:00:44,345 --> 01:00:45,746
-Ridiculous.

1176
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:48,082
-A bunch of us are going
up to the roof.

1177
01:00:50,317 --> 01:00:51,618
-Are you inviting me?

1178
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:52,851
-Yeah, do you want to go
up to the roof?

1179
01:00:52,853 --> 01:00:54,052
-Yes! Yes!

1180
01:00:54,054 --> 01:00:55,456
-We're getting a whole
group together.

1181
01:00:57,324 --> 01:00:58,692
-So you just want me
to leave, then?

1182
01:00:58,993 --> 01:01:00,425
-I don't know, dude.
It's a free country.

1183
01:01:00,427 --> 01:01:01,630
Do whatever you want.

1184
01:01:01,662 --> 01:01:03,128
We're going up
to the roof--

1185
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:04,465
-Shh. No. No.

1186
01:01:16,877 --> 01:01:19,614
You've got one of those
scary roofs, huh?

1187
01:01:20,549 --> 01:01:23,552
No railing.

1188
01:01:26,086 --> 01:01:27,352
-Can I have one?

1189
01:01:27,354 --> 01:01:28,453
-Uh... Yeah.

1190
01:01:28,455 --> 01:01:30,659
It's nicotine gum.

1191
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:33,227
-Sure, I'm trying
to quit anyways.

1192
01:01:34,895 --> 01:01:36,730
How long since you've
been off cigarettes?

1193
01:01:37,865 --> 01:01:39,231
-Oh, I'm not.

1194
01:01:39,233 --> 01:01:40,332
-Oh.

1195
01:01:40,334 --> 01:01:41,936
-I don't...
I mean, I don't smoke.

1196
01:01:42,703 --> 01:01:44,238
I just chew for the buzz.

1197
01:01:44,939 --> 01:01:46,305
Without the lung cancer.

1198
01:01:46,307 --> 01:01:47,676
-Now you're messing with me.

1199
01:01:48,042 --> 01:01:49,441
-No, seriously.

1200
01:01:49,443 --> 01:01:51,513
And I'm basically addicted
to it now.

1201
01:01:52,647 --> 01:01:54,014
I go through, like,
a pack a day.

1202
01:01:55,216 --> 01:01:56,583
-You're a pack-a-day
chewer?

1203
01:01:56,585 --> 01:01:57,885
-Yeah. Is that weird?

1204
01:01:58,352 --> 01:01:59,720
-Yeah. A little.

1205
01:02:04,526 --> 01:02:05,960
-Yeah, so...

1206
01:02:06,393 --> 01:02:08,729
What you got to do is
park and chew.

1207
01:02:09,698 --> 01:02:12,032
So you chew it until
you taste the peppery flavor.

1208
01:02:12,399 --> 01:02:15,169
And then you sort of park it
in the corner of your mouth

1209
01:02:15,537 --> 01:02:16,904
until the flavor goes away.

1210
01:02:18,172 --> 01:02:19,873
And then you start
chewing it again.

1211
01:02:25,647 --> 01:02:27,147
-Yeah, I think I taste
the pepper.

1212
01:02:29,383 --> 01:02:30,717
-No you don't.

1213
01:02:30,719 --> 01:02:31,883
But you will.

1214
01:02:31,885 --> 01:02:33,220
Then you'll get a head rush.

1215
01:02:33,854 --> 01:02:35,690
It's, like, the best part.

1216
01:02:44,498 --> 01:02:46,300
I'm sorry.
That was inappropriate.

1217
01:02:47,501 --> 01:02:48,902
-It's okay.

1218
01:02:52,406 --> 01:02:53,539
-Oh, I'm sorry.

1219
01:02:53,541 --> 01:02:54,707
-You already said that.

1220
01:02:54,709 --> 01:02:56,208
-Yeah, I thought...

1221
01:02:56,210 --> 01:02:57,309
like...

1222
01:02:57,311 --> 01:02:58,846
you meant it's okay, like...

1223
01:02:58,879 --> 01:03:00,145
I can...

1224
01:03:00,147 --> 01:03:01,346
-No.

1225
01:03:01,348 --> 01:03:02,617
I'm going back to the party.

1226
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:04,151
-Yeah, right on.

1227
01:03:04,918 --> 01:03:06,053
Yeah, I'm going to...

1228
01:03:07,121 --> 01:03:08,723
I'm going to stick up here.

1229
01:03:08,989 --> 01:03:10,357
Check out the cool view.

1230
01:03:15,764 --> 01:03:16,928
You're the one who's
over here

1231
01:03:16,930 --> 01:03:18,430
flirting with my
fucking friends.

1232
01:03:18,432 --> 01:03:19,532
-What?

1233
01:03:19,534 --> 01:03:21,433
-You're embarrassing yourself.

1234
01:03:21,435 --> 01:03:25,003
Because your band
fucking sucks.

1235
01:03:25,005 --> 01:03:26,838
You're a loser!

1236
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:27,906
-We're going there. Okay.

1237
01:03:27,908 --> 01:03:29,074
-Oh yeah, we're going to
go there.

1238
01:03:29,076 --> 01:03:30,208
-What the fuck do you do?
Go write a song.

1239
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:31,310
-Oh what the fuck do I do?

1240
01:03:31,312 --> 01:03:32,444
-Go sing a song.

1241
01:03:32,446 --> 01:03:33,746
-I can write a song.

1242
01:03:33,748 --> 01:03:36,582
I'll write a song on the guitar
I fucking bought for you

1243
01:03:36,584 --> 01:03:39,217
that you still owe me money for!

1244
01:03:39,219 --> 01:03:40,986
-It was a birthday present.

1245
01:03:40,988 --> 01:03:42,354
Are you fucking kidding me?
-Oh, that's right! That's right!

1246
01:03:42,356 --> 01:03:43,756
Fuck! I forgot.

1247
01:03:43,758 --> 01:03:45,023
It was a birthday present.

1248
01:03:45,025 --> 01:03:46,158
-Give me the fucking guitar.

1249
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:47,361
-Yeah, yeah. Sure, sure.

1250
01:03:47,595 --> 01:03:48,862
Psych!

1251
01:03:56,370 --> 01:03:57,672
-You're fucking insane.

1252
01:04:03,043 --> 01:04:04,512
-You need help, man?

1253
01:04:05,412 --> 01:04:06,646
Holly, wait.

1254
01:04:06,648 --> 01:04:08,046
-You were right.
He's a snake.

1255
01:04:08,048 --> 01:04:09,615
-Well, I never used
that word but...

1256
01:04:09,617 --> 01:04:11,619
-A pig.
A son-of-a-bitch.

1257
01:04:11,952 --> 01:04:14,019
I can't believe I wasted so much
of my fucking life

1258
01:04:14,021 --> 01:04:15,153
on that bloodsucker.

1259
01:04:15,155 --> 01:04:16,421
-I feel like you're being
a bit overdramatic

1260
01:04:16,423 --> 01:04:18,290
but if you really think
that's best then

1261
01:04:18,292 --> 01:04:19,527
I would support you--

1262
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:21,259
Stop doing that!

1263
01:04:21,261 --> 01:04:22,695
Why do you keep doing that?

1264
01:04:22,697 --> 01:04:23,862
-Okay, relax.

1265
01:04:23,864 --> 01:04:25,030
I'm just playing around.

1266
01:04:25,032 --> 01:04:26,900
Take the stick out of your ass.

1267
01:04:27,802 --> 01:04:29,169
-Fuck you, Holly!

1268
01:04:29,870 --> 01:04:31,970
-Why did you even follow me?

1269
01:04:31,972 --> 01:04:33,508
-To help you!

1270
01:04:33,742 --> 01:04:35,142
-I don't need your help!

1271
01:04:35,376 --> 01:04:37,008
-What the fuck is wrong
with you?

1272
01:04:37,010 --> 01:04:39,046
Oh my God.
This gum is really kicking in.

1273
01:04:39,681 --> 01:04:40,847
-You know what?

1274
01:04:40,849 --> 01:04:42,047
Fuck it.

1275
01:04:42,049 --> 01:04:43,181
If you and Bill want
to be together...

1276
01:04:43,183 --> 01:04:44,617
Have him!

1277
01:04:44,619 --> 01:04:45,986
-What are you talking about?

1278
01:04:47,354 --> 01:04:48,956
Holly, where are you going?

1279
01:04:49,557 --> 01:04:51,091
-Long Island!

1280
01:05:13,782 --> 01:05:14,915
Hey.

1281
01:05:20,822 --> 01:05:22,055
I'm sorry about that.

1282
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:26,795
-I mean, what the fuck
just happened?

1283
01:05:28,530 --> 01:05:29,731
-I don't know.

1284
01:05:31,533 --> 01:05:33,133
I think Holly needs some help.

1285
01:05:33,967 --> 01:05:35,169
She's losing her mind.

1286
01:05:37,938 --> 01:05:39,641
-I think we just need
to break up.

1287
01:05:43,944 --> 01:05:45,780
Hasn't been good for
a while, so...

1288
01:05:47,849 --> 01:05:49,016
-Yeah.

1289
01:05:49,884 --> 01:05:51,351
-I think that's a good idea.

1290
01:05:54,722 --> 01:05:57,057
Relationships are so crazy!

1291
01:06:01,028 --> 01:06:02,162
What the fuck?

1292
01:06:03,030 --> 01:06:04,231
-What?

1293
01:06:05,065 --> 01:06:06,298
-No, no.

1294
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:07,936
Get off.
What's wrong with you?

1295
01:06:08,202 --> 01:06:09,569
What's wrong with everyone
in this city?

1296
01:06:09,571 --> 01:06:11,205
Is there something
up in the water?

1297
01:06:11,573 --> 01:06:12,971
-I thought you liked me.
I'm sorry.

1298
01:06:12,973 --> 01:06:14,241
-You have a girlfriend!

1299
01:06:14,709 --> 01:06:16,845
-Yeah, and you just agreed
we should break up.

1300
01:06:17,144 --> 01:06:18,376
You're being really confusing.

1301
01:06:18,378 --> 01:06:19,581
-Srew you!

1302
01:06:20,715 --> 01:06:21,948
-Go fuck yourself.

1303
01:06:21,950 --> 01:06:23,516
-No. No, no, no.
You know what?

1304
01:06:23,518 --> 01:06:25,551
I used to think you all
were quirky New Yorkers

1305
01:06:25,553 --> 01:06:26,719
but your'e not.

1306
01:06:26,721 --> 01:06:27,920
You're full of shit.

1307
01:06:27,922 --> 01:06:29,054
You're all assholes!

1308
01:06:29,056 --> 01:06:30,322
This whole city's
full of assholes.

1309
01:06:30,324 --> 01:06:31,456
And you know what?

1310
01:06:31,458 --> 01:06:32,694
It's no better than Florida!

1311
01:06:57,217 --> 01:06:59,052
God damn it, Holly.

1312
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:07,929
How fucking clumsy

1313
01:07:08,195 --> 01:07:09,664
do you have...

1314
01:07:15,469 --> 01:07:16,669
Holly?

1315
01:07:16,671 --> 01:07:17,906
Oh my God!

1316
01:08:14,328 --> 01:08:15,528
Hey, sweetie.

1317
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:16,998
How are you feeling?

1318
01:08:18,398 --> 01:08:19,567
-I'm good.

1319
01:08:20,034 --> 01:08:21,266
-Good.

1320
01:08:21,268 --> 01:08:22,670
Let's watch a movie when
you get up.

1321
01:08:28,408 --> 01:08:31,476
There must be something
you want for Christmas.

1322
01:08:31,478 --> 01:08:33,946
Something that even your mother
doesn't know about..

1323
01:08:33,948 --> 01:08:36,416
Why don't you give me a chance?

1324
01:08:40,187 --> 01:08:41,522
Can we go
to the beach today?

1325
01:08:44,391 --> 01:08:46,259
-How about we just stay home?

1326
01:08:48,563 --> 01:08:49,797
-Okay.

1327
01:09:14,689 --> 01:09:16,124
Are you enjoying
your pizza?

1328
01:09:18,626 --> 01:09:19,761
-It's good.

1329
01:09:20,928 --> 01:09:22,162
-Would you like some red pepper?

1330
01:09:22,964 --> 01:09:24,231
-Sure.

1331
01:09:25,133 --> 01:09:26,400
