556
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:21,306
Chief Mallard, Deputies.

557
00:32:23,673 --> 00:32:25,106
Gentlemen, our Mayor,

558
00:32:25,108 --> 00:32:26,741
I thought we were having
this meeting in private.

559
00:32:26,743 --> 00:32:28,110
Yes, of course.

560
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,746
But being as this
is a public entity,

561
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:34,415
I'm bound by my open
meeting laws to be open.

562
00:32:34,417 --> 00:32:35,252
Very well.

563
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,286
Sir, I know you finished
the investigation.

564
00:32:39,288 --> 00:32:40,756
I'd like to know
what you plan to do

565
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:43,257
to the gentlemen
that murdered my son.

566
00:32:43,259 --> 00:32:45,529
And I'm assuming you've
landed on a punishment.

567
00:32:49,032 --> 00:32:49,967
Uh, judge.

568
00:32:52,068 --> 00:32:53,668
I'll speak plainly.

569
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:57,506
As an institution, we
have to trust our officers

570
00:32:57,508 --> 00:33:00,142
unless we find evidence
to the contrary.

571
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:02,777
You've seen the defense
lawyers attack them in court.

572
00:33:02,779 --> 00:33:05,546
If we lose that deference,

573
00:33:05,548 --> 00:33:07,748
then every slick
lawyer in the country

574
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:10,187
will be walking shysters
down the street.

575
00:33:15,592 --> 00:33:18,459
Based on everything our
investigators found,

576
00:33:18,461 --> 00:33:21,263
the officers involved
in CJ's incident

577
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:24,469
would not be disciplined
or charged in any way.

578
00:33:25,769 --> 00:33:28,772
The Fed reviewed our
findings and signed off.

579
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,175
The Federal government agrees?

580
00:33:33,076 --> 00:33:34,578
Unfortunately, yes.

581
00:33:36,747 --> 00:33:38,747
Chief Mallard, the Department
has signed off on this?

582
00:33:38,749 --> 00:33:41,749
Judge, I know this
must be hard for you

583
00:33:41,751 --> 00:33:43,718
to understand right now.

584
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,754
But whenever there's a
doubt of what happened

585
00:33:45,756 --> 00:33:48,824
on the field, we have
to rely on the testimony

586
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:50,725
of our officers.

587
00:33:50,727 --> 00:33:53,761
As a former officer
and as a judge,

588
00:33:53,763 --> 00:33:55,529
you must understand this.

589
00:33:55,531 --> 00:33:56,797
If you're on the
wrong side of this,

590
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,699
where are people like me?

591
00:33:58,701 --> 00:34:02,603
Or better yet, people who know
a lot less than me to turn

592
00:34:02,605 --> 00:34:05,407
when the gatekeeper
keeps the gate closed?

593
00:34:05,409 --> 00:34:06,210
Charles?

594
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:11,215
I hold you in the highest
esteem, highest respect.

595
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:15,416
I mean, you've been on
the bench for 10 years.

597
00:34:17,186 --> 00:34:20,521
in one of the most dangerous
cities in the country.

598
00:34:20,523 --> 00:34:22,557
And in spite of all
that, you did things

599
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:24,391
people would deem impossible.

600
00:34:24,393 --> 00:34:25,662
We recognize that.

601
00:34:26,762 --> 00:34:28,165
So I went to bat for you.

602
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,534
I was able to convince
our City Council

603
00:34:32,536 --> 00:34:35,769
to do what we felt was in
everybody's best interest

604
00:34:35,771 --> 00:34:38,440
to make a gesture
of good will to you.

605
00:34:38,442 --> 00:34:42,776

here is a tragedy.

There is no course that
will make things right.

607
00:34:47,483 --> 00:34:49,086
But in my power, I
can offer you that.

608

They said CJ pulled.

until I get some answers.

- Bring a civil.
- No, I can't do that.

If I do that they'll
take me off cases.

drag her with me.

forgot to tell me?

00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:21,287
That I'd be a felon.

Not allowed financial
aid for school.

couldn't go to college,
