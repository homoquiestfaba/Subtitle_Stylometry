1
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,540
Time.

2
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,020
Yeah!
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

3
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,120
Yeah! I like it like this!

4
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:59,450
These two crews right here
is what I call bad.

5
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:03,360
I'm talking bad as utter bad.
But it's up to you to decide...

6
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:07,800
...which crew walks away
with this here $600 in the hat.

7
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,740
Okay, let's settle down!
Let's settle down, now!

8
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,670
Now, by round of applause...

9
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,810
...you decide
who the baddest crew is tonight.

10
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,680
Let's hear it for Vick's crew.

11
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,250
What's up?

12
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,880
Let's go!

13
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,720
All right. Let's hear it
for David and Elgin's crew.

14
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:44,500
Well, well, well. Seems to me
like the money in the hat goes...

15
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:47,040
...to David and Elgin.
- Yeah!

16
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,540
- What you mean?
- Told you, boy!

17
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,730
That's what I'm talking about!

18
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,270
- Vick, y'all did your thing.
- No, that's twisted. We won.

19
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,540
No, no.
Whoa, whoa, now, young blood.

20
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,950
Don't come up in here with all that.
That ain't how it work.

21
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,750
You heard the people. You lost.

22
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:07,520
Now, you don't like the result,
you take yourself...

23
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:10,130
...you take your little crew,
you get to practicing...

24
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,700
...you bring it back,
we settle it on the floor like men.

25
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,460
- Yeah.
- All right. I want no trouble up in here.

26
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:21,370
- That's what I'm talking about.
- All right, Mr. Rad.

27
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,840
- Hey. Y'all were off the chain tonight.
- Yeah, y'all really hooked it up.

28
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,110
- Thanks.
- But you're missing one thing.

29
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,590
Really? What's that?

30
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,020
Me and my girl, Toya. She's the bomb.
We wanna get down with y'all.

31
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,390
Yeah, I seen her. She tight.

32
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,590
- So what's your name?
- Keke.

33
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,960
10:00 tomorrow, practice.
I'm gonna check y'all out.

34
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,800
- Cool.
- Thanks.

35
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,830
Anyway...

36
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:05,510
EI, dog, we was on point tonight.
They was feeling us.

37
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,710
I mean, can you imagine...

38
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:11,120
...when we blow up
and we in front of thousands of fans?

39
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,090
EI, what's up with you?

40
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:20,720
I'm tired of my mom always asking me
what I'm gonna do with my life.

41
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,200
She working double shifts now
because they went up on the rent.

42
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,860
It's messed up,
because Liyah got into Princeton.

43
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,510
That's cool and everything...

44
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,610
...but even with the scholarship,
she can't afford to go.

45
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:35,310
Now she's stuck at L.A. Community
College, working to save up.

46
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,210
This is killing me.

47
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:42,350
I saw Emerald
on the Shaw last night.

48
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,180
Gotta do what we gotta do.

49
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,590
- Ball up.
- Come on, baby.

50
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:59,240
- I can't believe we back here, man.
- Me neither, but it's just this once.

51
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,560
- Deal?
- Deal.

52
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,900
All right, let's get up here.

53
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:16,120
So if it isn't
my dancing delivery boys.

54
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,050
I knew you'd be back.

55
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,520
Your timing couldn't
have been better.

56
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,190
My last kid had to retire.

57
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,560
He was running his mouth
too much.

58
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,300
Here.

59
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,550
- Let's hurry up and get this over with.
- We gotta work pretty late.

60
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,490
- You might as well crash at my house.
- Cool. Come on.

61
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:59,460
Came out here.
You know, he immediately...

62
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,860
Good morning, baby.
Mama's late for work.

63
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,030
David and Elgin are asleep
on the floor.

64
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:09,180
- David?
- Lord knows what time they got home.

65
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,440
Let them sleep in.
They look tired.

66
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,740
And, Liyah, baby,
make them some breakfast.

67
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:25,150
It's a gift. You can't work on bouncing
a ball off a guy's head.

68
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:28,160
You're not a kid working on that.
It just comes to you.

69
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,990
He's a freak, a phenom.

70
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,130
He one of the tightest dudes
up there.

71
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,270
Got a lot of crazy moves
with the ball.

72
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,300
It was kind of hard to guard him,
you know what I'm saying? He look...

73
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:48,410
- Hi, David.
- Liyah?

74
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,110
I didn't know where I was
for a minute.

75
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,650
Well, sorry for waking you up.

76
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,900
Looks like you could use
a cup of coffee.

77
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:12,500
So El tells me the crew's
been winning every battle.

78
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:16,440
You know that's how we do.
When's the last time you saw us?

79
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,740
I'm embarrassed to say.

80
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:22,040
I think that Christmas you did
the show at the Fox Hills Mall.

81
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,280
- Dang, girl, that's messed up.
- All work and school. No play.

82
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,350
You know how it is.

83
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,130
What?

84
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,390
There's something different
about you.

85
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:43,730
Well, it's been, what, three years
since y'all moved to Baldwin Hills?

86
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,970
Stop.

87
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,870
You're bugging me out.

88
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:57,080
Well, I better get to work.

89
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,340
- You want a ride?
- No, I always walk.

90
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,850
I insist. Let me drive.

91
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:04,080
No, really. I work right down
in South Central Hospital.

92
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,660
It's the only exercise I get.

93
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:09,780
Dang, girl. With a physique like that,
you must walk three, four times a day.

94
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,020
You are so crazy.

95
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,400
- You can walk with me if you'd like.
- Okay.

96
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:19,530
No, let me.
Let me help you with that.

97
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:25,140
- David?
- Yeah?

98
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,070
The door?

99
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,420
My bad. Right. My bad.
Come on, girl.

100
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,740
- Hello?
- Where you at?

101
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,770
- Walking to work.
- You seen D?

102
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,200
- Yeah, he's here.
- Put him on the phone.

103
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,110
Here. El wants to talk to you.

104
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,410
- Hello.
- Hey, what you doing with Liyah?

105
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:05,070
Calm down, man.
I'm just walking her to work.

106
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,710
Look, some white kid out
of the County...

107
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:11,250
...gave me this tape last night
after the show. "Wade" or something.

108
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,330
- You ever heard of him?
- Wade, Wade...

109
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,890
Yeah, he got a homeboy named Max.

110
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,620
They competed last summer
in San Diego.

111
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,500
I asked around, and he's paid.

112
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,900
I'm talking cash money,
millionaire paid.

113
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:28,130
- Why'd he give you the tape?
- I'm waiting to watch with you.

114
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,070
All right, I'm on my way.

115
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,140
- I'm gonna get back.
- Thanks for walking with me.

116
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,440
Maybe I'll see you soon?

117
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,880
What's up, man?

118
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,710
What was you doing with Liyah?

119
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,590
Just talking. It's been a long time.
It ain't nothing.

120
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,850
Yeah, you right.
It better not be nothing.

121
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,930
I'm saying,
you my boy and everything.

122
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,500
When it comes to baby sis,
I will hurt somebody.

123
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,290
Relax.

124
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,900
- What's this?
- This is an official challenge.

125
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,670
There's your answer right there.

126
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:06,370
- This is the real. $5000 challenge.
- Did he just say $5000?

127
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,450
- We got this.
- Y'all put up five grand...

128
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,850
...and we'll put up five grand.
Your crew versus our crew.

129
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,450
- We'll let you pick the place.
- We'll even let you pick the time.

130
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,060
And as much as we don't wanna
take your money...

131
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,220
...the word is you're the best crew.

132
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,460
We have to show everyone
who the best really is.

133
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,530
- Come on, now.
- We gotta tell the crew.

134
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,860
- We'll tell them tonight after the battle.
- We're about to get this paper, dog.

135
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:22,610
All right, all right, all right.
That's time.

136
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:25,590
Time to see which one of these crews
y'all like best.

137
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,090
How about these folks right here?

138
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:37,160
All right, all right, all right.
What about this side here?

139
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,970
What's up?
Take it to that bank!

140
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:47,710
It would seem to me like the money
in the hat would go to your team.

141
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,120
But we have a little situation here.

142
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:59,090
David and Elgin's crew came up to me
right before this kicked off and said:

143
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:03,060
"Look here, Mr. Rad. We'd like to
challenge them for double or nothing."

144
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:05,520
The question is...

145
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:10,070
Look at me.
The question is, what you gonna do?

146
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,500
Sit down, take your time,
work it out amongst each other.

147
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:17,140
- Chatter, chatter, here we go.
- Let's do it, yo.

148
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:18,940
Then it's on.

149
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,520
Time!

150
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,330
- That's right! That's right!
- Yeah, boy!

151
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,910
Gather round, gather round.
Come on, come on.

152
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,180
That was hot, man.

153
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,480
Catch up with y'all later.
I got a date.

154
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,280
Rico, we need
a group discussion.

155
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:22,650
We just got a $5000 challenge from
some rich kid out of Orange County.

156
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,920
Show me the money. What-what!

157
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,590
Marty, can you get Oscar
to be down with us?

158
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,170
He don't battle no more.

159
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,170
- You think you could ask anyway?
- Yeah, I'll ask.

160
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:37,300
All right, cool.
Look, this is serious, y'all.

161
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,040
I'm talking practice every day,
even on the weekend.

162
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:43,180
Y'all gotta be on point.
If y'all ain't down that night...

163
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,780
...you don't get that money.

164
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:48,040
- We gonna have to put money up?
- Me and D will put up money.

165
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,120
We gonna split 3000
and y'all divvy up the rest. Cool?

166
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,720
- I'm with it.
- I'm down.

167
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:55,150
Yeah, I'm ready to get pizz-aid!

168
00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:00,030
I'm not with it. I mean, why y'all two
get 1500 each?

169
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,060
We a crew. Win or lose as a team.

170
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,960
- They're putting the money up.
- True.

171
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,470
So? They getting it back.
It's like y'all making money off of us.

172
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,200
Sonny, why you tripping?

173
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:11,900
We gotta put the money up
to practice in the gym.

174
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,010
I think we should split
the whole 5000.

175
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:18,440
Then you put up 5000 for the battle.
And when we win, we'll all split it.

176
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,340
- That's what I thought.
- You wanna do this?

177
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,010
- Yeah!
- Let's do it!

178
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:26,680
All right, I'm about to go get
our winnings from Mr. Rad.

179
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,520
- All right.
- What a night.

180
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:32,220
- Hey, Rico.
- What's up, Lil Saint?

181
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,560
Y'all was the bomb. When y'all gonna
let me get down with you?

182
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:37,830
Never, punk. You can't even move.

183
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,990
Rico, why you hang out with this
little thug? He ain't sh...

184
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:43,200
Look, why don't you mind
your business?

185
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:46,570
He got everybody hating on him.
It won't happen in front of me.

186
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,710
Sonny, you can't say nothing
about Lil Saint to Rico.

187
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,280
He'll kill somebody over him.

188
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,480
Ric, he worships the ground
you walk on.

189
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:57,250
But I ain't gonna lie,
he is a little badass.

190
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,720
And he does dance like a white boy.

191
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,720
I'm out of here. Come on, son,
let me take you home.

192
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,620
Who's hungry?

193
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,360
- Let's bounce. Let's bounce.
- I'm hungry.

194
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,730
You know what I mean?

195
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,130
- Man, that battle was crazy.
- All right, cool.

196
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:19,240
Hi. I told you I would see you soon.

197
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:21,970
Congratulations.
I was at the battle.

198
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:24,580
I would have showed off
if I knew you was coming.

199
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,270
Wait, David.
I been knowing you all my life.

200
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,620
You think I like you or something?

201
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,720
- No, but...
- Because I do like you.

202
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:35,150
And the moment you all
have been waiting for.

203
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:37,450
Beautifull has arrived.

204
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,660
Oh, wait. Hold it.

205
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,930
Is this Mr. Man?

206
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,660
- How you doing?
- Girl. He's hot.

207
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,670
David, this is my crazy best friend,
Beautifull.

208
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,300
And that's with two L's. You got
to accentuate the L's, you know?

209
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,100
Let it roll off your tongue.

210
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,580
- Oh, Beautifull.
- Yes.

211
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,180
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

212
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:01,440
- Li, what you doing here?
- I got somebody to work for me.

213
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:05,280
- You shouldn't be missing work.
- You shouldn't be all up in her mix.

214
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:10,660
- Yo, D, we gotta bounce.
- Where you going?

215
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:14,320
- None of your business. Come on.
- All right, see y'all later.

216
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,300
Bye.

217
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,190
Your brother's cute.

218
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,240
- Look, man, this the last time.
- You said that last time.

219
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,300
- Look...
- Whatever. I don't want to hear it.

220
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:10,080
Y'all put up five grand
and we'll put up five grand.

221
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,310
Your crew versus our crew.

222
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:14,750
Straight up. We'll let you pick the...

223
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,770
Hey, Rico.

224
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,210
Hey, y'all hold up, all right?

225
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:45,590
- What up, little man?
- Hey, can I play? Can I play, please?

226
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,920
- Next time.
- Oh, man.

227
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:52,620
Just go chill. When I'm done,
I'll take you to go get some ice cream.

228
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,530
- All right.
- All right. For sure. Come on, y'all.

229
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,370
- Get it, get it, get it!
- Got him.

230
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:22,960
- Travel.
- What?

231
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:25,720
- Travel. What, y'all blind? He traveled.
- Come on...

232
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,560
...quit crying. This is street ball.
- Still cheating.

233
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:31,930
When you gonna learn?
Can't battle us on stage or the court.

234
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,090
No matter what, we'll spank you.
We got all this right here.

235
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:38,110
- All this around here, player.
- Except for the girls.

236
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,510
I was with yours last night.

237
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:44,840
Ball up. No basket. We going back
this way. Here we go. Come on, y'all.

238
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,690
- Party!
- Keep the game going. I'll be back.

239
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,190
We were surprised
to hear from you.

240
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,660
- Why?
- Didn't think you were up for a beating.

241
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,860
- We don't get beat.
- Okay.

242
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:07,460
This should be fun.

243
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:11,030
Next Saturday night,
the warehouse, 11.

244
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,640
- What's so funny?
- Your crew, man.

245
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:16,370
Y'all need a week?
These kids need a whole week.

246
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:19,810
To what, practice?
See, my crew, we don't practice.

247
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,520
- We just do it.
- So do we.

248
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:23,210
- So do it.
- Oh, we'll do it.

249
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:26,250
- Tonight then, baby boy?
- Tonight it's on.

250
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,390
And I ain't your baby boy.

251
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:32,460
Mr. Rad's warehouse. Y'all suckers
just make sure y'all there by sundown.

252
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,820
Just bring the 5 G's,
all right, man?

253
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,360
That's right.
We'll see who the sucker is.

254
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:50,610
Hey, yo, D.
Man, I gotta talk to you.

255
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:52,480
What's up?

256
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,380
What'd you get into?

257
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:00,290
Look, we battling Wade and his crew.
Tonight.

258
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,550
- What?
- Man, they try to clown us, D.

259
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:03,950
They said we're scared.

260
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:05,650
- I ain't scared. You?
- Hell, no.

261
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:08,630
Then what's stopping us
from taking they money tonight?

262
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,360
Nothing. Except we don't
have 5 G's to put up.

263
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:18,340
I got about 2 G's saved up
from Emerald.

264
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:21,880
- How much you got?
- About 1500.

265
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:25,280
Come on, man. You know
I had to hit up the mall, man.

266
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:30,120
- So we got 3500.
- How we gonna get 1500 by tonight?

267
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,420
I'll get the money.
You just get the crew together.

268
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,020
You crazy.

269
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:39,130
- But I always got your back, man.
- For sure.

270
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:42,730
That's what I like.

271
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,710
- Grandma.
- Hey, baby. Grandmama's heart.

272
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,140
Come give me some sugar.

273
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:57,940
- How you feeling today, Grandma?
- Oh, well...

274
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,940
Got arthritis in my leg.
Threw my back out at bingo...

275
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,380
...because you know when I win,
I do my dance.

276
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:06,680
Blood pressure's up
and I think I done caught the gout.

277
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:10,690
But as you know,
I ain't one to complain.

278
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:14,290
- How are you?
- Okay, I guess.

279
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:19,600
- What?
- Something's wrong. I feel it.

280
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:23,070
- You having sex?
- Now, come on, Grandma.

281
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,900
I diapered it.
I can ask about it.

282
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,870
It's nothing like that.
I came by to say hi. That's all.

283
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:30,140
You talk to your grandmama.
Right now.

284
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:37,850
I need to borrow some money.

285
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:40,920
Tell me what you need the money for.
And don't lie to me.

286
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:43,480
This crew tried
to chump my crew today.

287
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:46,890
And I wasn't having it,
so I told them we'll battle tonight.

288
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:51,060
That's that pride talking.
You got that from your granddaddy.

289
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,370
- How much money you talking about?
- 1500.

290
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,030
That's a lot of money.

291
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:58,640
Granddaddy also taught me never
to give up.

292
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,200
You're a smooth talker like him too.

293
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:05,210
Well, let me see what I got
in my stash.

294
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,780
These kids sure get crazy.

295
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,280
- Here they come.
- Yeah!

296
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,720
I thought you said Sonny
was gonna meet us.

297
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:19,830
I told him I would pick him up,
but he said he had a ride.

298
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,460
- I'm gonna call him at his house.
- D, man, we can't afford to lose.

299
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:26,260
We never lose. Why start now?

300
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,230
- Hey, he not picking up.
- He'll be here.

301
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,580
- Mr. Rad.
- What you say, young blood?

302
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,480
- How you feeling?
- Good.

303
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:46,380
It's a beautiful day in Mr. Rad's
neighborhood. It's $5000, man.

304
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:48,820
Reminds me of the good old days.

305
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:51,020
We used to race each other
for a quarter.

306
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:55,930
I win that quarter, we all be down at
the store licking on the same Popsicle.

307
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:59,260
- Here's the money.
- Well...

308
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,270
Well, this is a little more money
than will fit in my hat...

309
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,810
...so I got a little friend of mine
I'd like for y'all to meet up.

310
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,640
Mr. Chuck.

311
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:13,610
Mr. Chuck here is L.A.P.D.

312
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:20,750
He's off-duty. He's just here to make
sure that everything goes accordingly.

313
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:25,730
Mr. Chuck, why don't you show
everybody what you're working with.

314
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,090
Damn.

315
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:31,060
Everybody good with that?

316
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:35,100
Fine. Thank you, there, Mr. Chuck.

317
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:38,140
We'll keep this thing nice,
fair and square.

318
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:42,940
This a lot of money we talking about.
Money ain't the most important thing.

319
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:47,510
Friendship is the most important thing.
No matter what, win, lose or draw...

320
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:51,550
...we gonna be friends after this.
There will be no fighting.

321
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,450
We understand each other?

322
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,120
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

323
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:57,920
All right, let's do this.

324
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,990
Hey, guys, Sonny's here.

325
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:05,760
- What's up, Sonny?
- Yo, Sonny!

326
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,810
Yo, Sonny, what's up, man?

327
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:14,310
I forgot to tell you.
We got a surprise guest.

328
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,940
Go ahead, David!

329
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:40,760
You peeping this, man?
They're taking all our moves.

330
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,200
That's our move right there.

331
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:50,000
That's your move right there.

332
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:15,670
What?

333
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:26,400
- That's your move right there.
- He sold us out.

334
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,680
Sonny sold us out.

335
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:10,790
You all right?
Look what they're doing to it.

336
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,420
Get back!

337
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:45,250
What's the matter with you?
I said, in the beginning, no fighting!

338
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:49,020
You don't come in here with all that!
We gonna do this the right way!

339
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,100
All right, now,
by round of applause.

340
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,410
All right, I've got it.
I said, I got it. I got it!

341
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,170
That's right, baby.

342
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:11,950
- Let's do this again.
- We'd love to take your money.

343
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:15,020
- Again.
- Back over there. Get back!

344
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:17,420
But this ain't fair.
Y'all stole our moves!

345
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,490
You just mad.

346
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:22,150
Because tonight
you suckers got served.

347
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,770
Get your head up.
You lost the money. It's gone.

348
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:38,210
You can't lay around
in your misery too long.

349
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:42,180
Do not walk out of this place
and start to second-guess your talent.

350
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:44,050
You got your ass whupped tonight.

351
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:47,820
But I done seen y'all whup many a ass
right in this same place.

352
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:51,990
Now you lost. Tell you something
my father told me, remember this:

353
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:56,160
If it don't kill you,
it make you stronger.

354
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:01,200
I can't take this tonight, man.

355
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:03,700
EI. EI.

356
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:07,280
Sonny gonna get his.
Don't worry about that.

357
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:10,370
Let's go.

358
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:17,350
- Tell me last night didn't happen.
- It happened.

359
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:21,860
Damn. Tell me Sonny didn't dis us
and Wade didn't play us for $5000.

360
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,050
We can make some
of that back tonight.

361
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:26,890
Emerald said we could roll.

362
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,550
- That's straight.
- I'm still bugging, though, D.

363
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:32,070
How the hell we lose 5 G's
in 10 minutes, man?

364
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,600
- What was we thinking?
- I just didn't know they were so shady.

365
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,900
Man, I know I didn't.

366
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,410
- Looking for a new man?
- What about your crew?

367
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,440
They don't battle if they don't win.

368
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:46,740
So what's up, EI? D? Can I be down?

369
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,440
Sure, man. Cool, cool.

370
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,180
Yo, ball up.

371
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:58,690
- D!
- Teams? Y'all not on teams, man.

372
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:01,420
I'm gonna head out, man.
I gotta do something.

373
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,030
- What time will you swoop me up?
- Meet you there.

374
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,360
I'll meet you there.
I'm always on time. 10:00, all right?

375
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,870
- Whatever.
- Hey, could you spot me a 20, dog?

376
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,670
I don't got it.

377
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:18,200
- Man, all I got is $ 10.
- That's straight. See y'all later, man.

378
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,980
- Let's do it.
- Y'all wanna run threes?

379
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,390
- Who you blowing your horn at?
- Hey.

380
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:37,120
We are ladies, okay? You are
supposed to say, "Excuse me, miss."

381
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,100
- It's David.
- I know.

382
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:41,740
Excuse me, miss. How are you today?

383
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:43,460
You see? That was much better.

384
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,500
- What are you doing here?
- I came to pick up my girl.

385
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,140
And you? What you doing here?
Where you going?

386
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:53,540
- Wherever my man wants to take me.
- Okay, then.

387
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:56,280
So, Beautifull,
you need us to drop you off?

388
00:34:56,450 --> 00:35:00,580
I push my own wheels.
Thank you. Have fun.

389
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,590
Hello?

390
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,460
Oh, what's up, Rashann?

391
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:10,500
Yeah. Yeah, man, I'm cool.

392
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,860
Hey, let me call you back,
though, all right?

393
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:15,200
Sorry.

394
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:17,430
Everybody still tripping
off the battle.

395
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:20,270
I hate that I can't do anything
to cheer you up.

396
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,670
No, this is good.

397
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,750
Hello?

398
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,280
What's up, Marty?

399
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:34,320
I'm gonna call you back, all right?

400
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:36,290
All right.

401
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,760
Now, what were you saying?

402
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:41,450
Something like
you was all in love with me?

403
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:45,470
- I didn't say that.
- No, but you was thinking that.

404
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:56,370
- Hold on, hold on.
- Come on, dog!

405
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:57,810
Damn.

406
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:06,820
- I need you to come through earlier.
- Earlier? How early?

407
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:09,120
- Now.
- Now? Come on, I need a minute.

408
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:13,230
- Want me to give it to somebody else?
- No, no, no. Look, I'll be there.

409
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,090
Just...

410
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:17,190
Hello?

411
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:19,860
- What's up?
- I gotta get up out of here, Vick.

412
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,870
I'll holler at you later, dog.

413
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:25,140
Let's go, ball up!

414
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:29,230
D, come on, man, where you at?

415
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:32,110
Damn.

416
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:42,890
- I know you did not turn off my phone.
- Yes, I did.

417
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:46,290
No more calls.
You're with your boys every day.

418
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,760
And when you're with me...

419
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:50,920
...you're all mine.

420
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,600
I see you got attitude.

421
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,370
I like it.

422
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,790
That's a lot of merchandise, player.

423
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,030
We can handle it.

424
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:30,440
- Where's your partner?
- He gonna meet me at the spot.

425
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:01,930
Come on, D, pick up, man. Pick up.

426
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:07,770
Damn. Yo, D, it's EI, man.
Where you at? I'm at the spot.

427
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,470
Look, plans got moved up.

428
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:13,980
Hit me back soon as you get this.
Better yet, just come the hell over!

429
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,740
Hey, it's dark outside. What time is it?

430
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,110
I was supposed to hook up
with your brother.

431
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,890
Eight messages?
Dang, somebody blowing me up.

432
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,420
It better be your boys.

433
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:32,290
Hello?

434
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,560
What?

435
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,530
- Who is it?
- Is he all right?

436
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:41,700
All right, tell him to sit tight.
I'm on my way.

437
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,370
- EI! EI, are you okay?
- Yo, EI, we came as soon as we heard.

438
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:51,240
Oh, so now you want to show up?

439
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:54,050
Don't say nothing.
I don't want to hear it.

440
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:57,650
- What happened?
- You left me out hanging, that's what!

441
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:00,220
Hooking up with my sister
was more important.

442
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:02,120
- No...
- Shut up, Liyah!

443
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,690
Just so you know...

444
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,330
...we ain't cool.

445
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:11,160
We ain't boys. We ain't nothing.

446
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:13,760
I swear you ain't getting
with my sister.

447
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:17,270
- I turned off his phone.
- I could be dead right now!

448
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,970
You gonna stand in my face
and take up for him?

449
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,910
Go home and stop acting like a ho!

450
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,340
Hey! Keep it down.

451
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,980
Don't be talking to her like that.

452
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:33,110
Whatever I say to her ain't got nothing
to do with you. Get out my face, D!

453
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:36,990
- You all are gonna have to leave.
- I'm out.

454
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,350
- My man is tripping.
- El is on...

455
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:43,800
You got busy with his sister
and left him?

456
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:45,330
I don't roll like that.

457
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,490
I'm sorry, dog, but you do, man.

458
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:49,970
I mean, you did it with Dawn,
Shandrella...

459
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,660
...and with the triplets...

460
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,670
- You killing me.
- It's true, though.

461
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,310
- You always leave us hanging.
- Not this time.

462
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,210
I wouldn't do it.

463
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,940
And Liyah just ain't some girl.

464
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:04,620
- I'm out, man. Out.
- D.

465
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:37,280
Why are you sitting here in the dark?

466
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,510
Thinking.

467
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:41,950
About what?

468
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:44,820
About a lot.

469
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,490
I can't play ball.

470
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:51,360
Can't get with my crew.

471
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:55,870
All because my leg is messed up.
This ain't never gonna be the same.

472
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,170
Sitting in here for three days straight...

473
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:01,740
...mad at the world
isn't gonna change anything.

474
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,080
And, EI...

475
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:09,410
...you need to call David.
- I'm caught out because of him.

476
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:11,180
- Why blame him?
- He was hooking up...

477
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:14,350
...instead of taking care of business.
- But I already told you...

478
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,090
Emerald don't give a damn
about why David didn't show up.

479
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:21,720
All Emerald cares about
is the stuff that I got jacked for.

480
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:27,070
Liyah, where am I supposed to get
the money to pay Emerald back?

481
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,800
Maybe David can talk to Emerald.

482
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:35,570
- He wants to help.
- I don't need nobody to do nothing.

483
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:37,640
I'll handle Emerald.

484
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:42,550
And how you know
David wants to help?

485
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,350
Didn't I tell you to stay away?

486
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,890
- Elgin, don't start.
- He's playing you, Liyah.

487
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:49,820
Now, stay away from him.

488
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,640
Yo, D, Lil Saint keep bugging me
about joining the crew.

489
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:11,370
- Little man can't dance.
- I could work with him.

490
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,610
- Or he could be, like, our mascot.
- Yeah.

491
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:15,610
That's a good idea. What you think?

492
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:19,120
- I'm cool with that. Call him over.
- Hey, Lil Saint, come here.

493
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,990
- What's up, Ric?
- He is so cute.

494
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,160
You one of us now, Saint.

495
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:27,920
- Congratulations.
- For real?

496
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,860
That's right. You in the crew now.

497
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:33,000
Yeah, Rico, I'm just like you now.

498
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:36,700
You got to keep the deal: No cursing,
hustling, no getting in trouble.

499
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:39,140
No running with them dudes
you've been with.

500
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:41,640
Yeah, them dudes
you running with ain't safe.

501
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:45,540
- It's my word.
- Okay. Practice, 6:00 tomorrow.

502
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:50,380
- All right, boy. Get out of here.
- All right, Saint, man.

503
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:53,720
- Has anybody talked to EI?
- No, he won't accept my calls.

504
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:56,880
- Mine either.
- I been trying to reach out to him.

505
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:59,030
Everybody's talking about your beef.

506
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,360
Forget that. I'm talking
about your Oscar hookup.

507
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,240
- Is he gonna be down with us?
- He ain't into battles no more.

508
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,460
Man, he's into the pureness of the art.
He's all spiritual and whatnot.

509
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:13,810
If there's anything we can do
to get him, holler.

510
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,670
I'm about to go shoot some hoops.
You wanna come?

511
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:18,750
No, I'll catch up with y'all later.

512
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,350
- For sure.
- All right, man.

513
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,640
Come on, Saint.

514
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,730
- Your boy is really tripping.
- Did you tell him I called?

515
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,730
Yes, but he bugs out
every time I say your name.

516
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:47,970
We been boys for too long
for it to end like this.

517
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:53,010
Please don't tell him I told you...

518
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:54,740
...but El's in trouble.

519
00:44:56,050 --> 00:44:59,210
When the guys jumped him,
they took Emerald's stuff.

520
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:01,510
I thought it happened
before Emerald's.

521
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,350
- Can you please talk to Emerald?
- Talk?

522
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:08,360
There ain't no talking to that man.

523
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:11,400
I gotta help El get this money.

524
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,560
And I was supposed to be with him
that night.

525
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:18,500
- Liyah, what you doing here?
- Hey, you tripping!

526
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:20,430
- I'm tired...
- Don't disrespect me!

527
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:22,970
- You disrespect me by putting your...
- Go home!

528
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:26,510
- What's wrong with you?
- You lost your mind!

529
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,950
We were trying to figure out how
to help you.

530
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,240
And you come in here and pull this?

531
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:33,220
Move.

532
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:35,490
Liyah!

533
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:41,720
Here you go.

534
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:45,830
You know what they say.
Hot chocolate make the pain go away.

535
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,470
- Who says that?
- Me.

536
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:51,160
Anything's that hot and chocolate, girl,
you know you can't go wrong.

537
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,970
I can't believe Elgin
put his hands on you.

538
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:59,410
I would have took my shoe off
and did damage.

539
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,640
- Things are so messed up.
- You think?

540
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:06,640
There ain't no thinking about it, girl,
you in love.

541
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:10,690
I mean, David is not like these
other Joes you been kicking it with.

542
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:14,820
And Beautifull is here
to keep it real with you.

543
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,190
This is that Mary J. Blige, real love.

544
00:46:18,370 --> 00:46:20,330
Remember?
I was like this with my boo.

545
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:23,100
- You call all of your men boo.
- Russell-boo?

546
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:25,640
Remember? He was my first love.

547
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:30,970
Then there was Toby-boo
and now Lamar. He's my boobie-boo.

548
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:35,840
But what I'm saying is, I know
what real love looks like. Okay?

549
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:37,650
And you in love, child.

550
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,520
And you know what?

551
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:43,350
You can stay here
as long as you need to.

552
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,860
You know you my girl
and that I got you.

553
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:47,960
- Thanks, B.
- You're welcome.

554
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:51,100
Now, I'm gonna get my makeup kit...

555
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:53,730
...and we gonna have a girls' night,
have some fun.

556
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:37,000
- I'm gonna get your money soon.
- Shush.

557
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:40,110
I'm just glad you're alive,
thank the Lord.

558
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,040
- I can't believe...
- Grandma. Hi.

559
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:45,780
Hey, if it ain't my future doctor.
How's school?

560
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:49,980
Oh, I could have done better
on my exams, but I had a lot going on.

561
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,680
You always make me proud.

562
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:55,020
I'm worried about you
and your brother.

563
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,960
What's this your mama tells me
about you not speaking?

564
00:47:58,130 --> 00:48:01,930
Look here. Whatever's going on,
I want it to stop right now.

565
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,470
Do you understand? Start talking.

566
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,910
- He hit me.
- No, I didn't!

567
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:15,010
Have you lost your mind?

568
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:17,120
You never put your hand
on any woman.

569
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,950
- She better stay away from David.
- I'm gonna see him.

570
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:22,190
Do it and see what I do to him.

571
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:25,960
Wait, you know what?
You win, okay?

572
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:28,660
So I won't see him.

573
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:30,800
- You happy?
- For sure.

574
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:32,790
I hate you.

575
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:34,960
Liyah, baby.

576
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:38,160
Sit your ass down.

577
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:45,840
Now, you leave that girl alone.

578
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:48,740
I'm not telling you
you can't protect your sister.

579
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:52,920
But if she's making a mistake, you got
to let her so she can learn from it.

580
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:54,510
Do you understand?

581
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:00,250
I asked you a question.

582
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:04,360
Elgin Barrett Eugene Smith III.

583
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,590
Do you hear me?

584
00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:09,900
Yes, ma'am.

585
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,560
Okay, then.

586
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:15,530
I gotta get going.

587
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:19,840
Come on and walk an old woman
out to her car.

588
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:24,420
My feet feel so swollen
it's like walking on water.

589
00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:27,780
Bye, baby.

590
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,870
I heard you got a beat-down.

591
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:53,700
Yeah, I got jacked.

592
00:49:55,850 --> 00:49:58,650
Look, I was gonna call you
soon as I got your money.

593
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:01,510
I didn't want to disturb you until then.

594
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:03,780
I called you 10 times...

595
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,420
...and you don't return my call?

596
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:08,690
- No. I mean, yeah, I was going...
- Now you want to talk?

597
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:10,850
I didn't tell you to talk!

598
00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:12,860
I'll talk. You listen!

599
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:18,390
I don't know where you're gonna get
the money from to pay me back.

600
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:24,440
But I do know you'll make a valiant
effort in that regard. Am I right?

601
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:26,800
Now you talk.

602
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:29,410
Right.

603
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:32,440
I could work it off.

604
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:35,680
Your days as a courier
for me are over.

605
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:39,260
How do I know you didn't set this up
yourself to get my money?

606
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:42,490
- Look, I didn't even know...
- Hey, I don't trust nobody!

607
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:47,560
In my eyes, you're guilty
until proven innocent.

608
00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:50,240
I want my money.

609
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:53,970
You'll get your money.

610
00:50:54,610 --> 00:50:56,200
Now, that's what I wanna hear.

611
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:01,240
I'll even let you tell me when you can
get me my money.

612
00:51:01,410 --> 00:51:02,710
Six months?

613
00:51:09,790 --> 00:51:11,720
I usually say 24 hours.

614
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:15,850
But since your partner called me
and begged me...

615
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:18,460
...to leave you in one piece...

616
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:20,720
...I'm gonna give you a few weeks.

617
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,200
Don't play me, EI.

618
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:25,740
You do...

619
00:51:28,270 --> 00:51:30,370
...you'll never walk...

620
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:33,510
...let alone dance, again.

621
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:36,570
Now, excuse yourself.

622
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:06,000
Yo, D!

623
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:08,480
Marty, work with them.

624
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:11,140
What's up, man?

625
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:13,980
Your new crew's wack!
Where did you get them?

626
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:18,520
- Why you busting my crew out, man?
- Go sit down.

627
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:22,530
Hey, Ric, man, you taking
this loyalty thing a little too far.

628
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:26,630
I mean, if you got down with me
and Marty, El won't care. I need you.

629
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,540
We'll be up against another crew
in a few days.

630
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:29,130
We'll be up against another crew
in a few days.

631
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:30,530
Wanna make some money?

632
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:33,600
I'm always down to make money,
but I can't.

633
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:36,140
I saw El the other day.
He got a new crew too.

634
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:39,810
- Word?
- Yeah, and I'll tell you like I told him.

635
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:41,570
It just don't feel right.

636
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:45,150
You and El is like Shaq and Kobe.
Together y'all do damage.

637
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,910
It ain't the same
when one's not in the game.

638
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:51,520
Look, y'all both my boys, but if I can't
never get the old crew back...

639
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:54,350
...me and Saint just might have
to do our own thing.

640
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:55,930
The way El’s acting...

641
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:58,790
...I don't think we
ever gonna be cool.

642
00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:01,330
Look, man, let me get back.
All right?

643
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:03,830
Yo, Saint, let's roll.

644
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:31,140
You and me.
Right now. Look, look.

645
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:35,350
That ain't even cool, man.

646
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,420
It don't matter.

647
00:55:37,590 --> 00:55:39,850
Let's bounce.

648
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:50,860
Yo, D.

649
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,730
- What's up, Ric?
- What's up, player?

650
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:55,530
Chilling. That jersey's tight.
Where'd you get that?

651
00:55:55,710 --> 00:55:56,940
Rico got it for me.

652
00:55:57,110 --> 00:56:00,380
- Rico take good care of you, don't he?
- Yep.

653
00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:06,110
Watch out, man.

654
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:09,090
I ain't gonna have much more
of you swinging.

655
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:13,280
- Lf you hadn't left him out in the cold...
- I didn't. This between me and my boy.

656
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:15,050
- He ain't your boy.
- Chill, Vick.

657
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:17,530
- Why you trying to start?
- What you wanna do?

658
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:20,720
- Yeah, what you wanna do?
- Hold up. This ain't going down.

659
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:22,930
Y'all mad at the wrong people.

660
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:25,870
Y'all need to throw that hate
towards Wade and them.

661
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:30,070
All I'm saying is, you need to find
the love again, because this...

662
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:31,610
...it ain't right.

663
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:34,840
- Come on, Saint. We out.
- Yeah, we out.

664
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:57,330
- What's up, Ric?
- The Big Bounce...

665
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,940
...that's what's up.
Check this out. Read this.

666
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:01,570
Fifty thousand dollars?

667
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:03,940
Yes, man. Enough money
to change our lives.

668
00:57:04,110 --> 00:57:06,240
Look, a chance to be
in a music video.

669
00:57:06,410 --> 00:57:08,440
I'm talking putting some kids
on the map.

670
00:57:08,610 --> 00:57:10,640
- And getting paid.
- Yes, man, it's ours.

671
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:12,340
Tailor-made for us, EI.

672
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,450
I been praying
for something like this.

673
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:19,850
I owe Emerald a lot of money, man.

674
00:57:20,030 --> 00:57:22,360
And this could be my only way
to pay him back.

675
00:57:22,530 --> 00:57:24,660
And I could pay
my grandmama back.

676
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:26,300
Man, I gotta win.

677
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:28,160
Yeah, we can win.

678
00:57:28,330 --> 00:57:31,570
- But you gotta get David in...
- Ain't no David, man.

679
00:57:32,270 --> 00:57:33,860
Think Wade's crew gonna get in?

680
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:37,200
You know it. They already saying
the Big Bounce is theirs.

681
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:39,170
No, not this time.

682
00:57:39,810 --> 00:57:41,910
Wade ain't getting this.
This is mine.

683
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:46,940
- Fifty thousand dollars?
- And a shot to rock a music video.

684
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:48,780
We gotta do it with the old crew.

685
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,690
- Rashann, Saint, El...
- What?

686
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:54,050
No, man.
I'm tired of El dissing me.

687
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:57,790
I'm gonna win this money, then break
him off some so I don't owe him.

688
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:02,400
But that's just the way that story ends.
I'll catch up with you. 50,000!

689
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:50,230
Hey, what's up, y'all?
I'm La La from MTV...

690
00:59:50,410 --> 00:59:52,840
...and I'm chilling
at the L.A. Convention Center...

691
00:59:53,010 --> 00:59:56,310
...in sunny Southern California.
I'm surrounded by crews.

692
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:59,950
It is the semifinals
of the Big Bounce competition.

693
01:00:00,190 --> 01:00:02,550
It has been off the hook
for real, for real...

694
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:05,690
...and I'm gonna keep you updated
on what's going down.

695
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:34,140
Mr. Rad, come here. I want you
to meet my friend, Beautifull.

696
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:37,620
- Hey, Beautiful.
- That's Beautifull with two L's.

697
01:00:38,590 --> 01:00:39,820
Nice to meet you.

698
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,790
So, what's going on
with David and Elgin out here?

699
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:47,460
I been trying to talk to these two.
I can't seem to get through.

700
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:50,000
They need to stop
all this messing around.

701
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:54,800
Wait a minute,
are y'all feeling this right now?

702
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:59,840
I'm talking about the hottest crews
from Los Angeles, California...

703
01:01:00,010 --> 01:01:03,240
...competing for $50,000!

704
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:06,350
Do y'all hear me? $50,000 for real!

705
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,990
Mr. Rad, I'm really worried
about Elgin.

706
01:01:15,330 --> 01:01:19,020
Liyah, I've known you kids around
this neighborhood all your life.

707
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:22,830
There's one person that you can
talk to around here, that's Mr. Rad.

708
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,560
Now, come on.

709
01:01:25,070 --> 01:01:27,400
Elgin owes Emerald
a lot of money and...

710
01:01:27,570 --> 01:01:31,100
Ain't nothing to worry yourself about.
I done took care of that.

711
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:33,640
- But how...?
- I got a friend, Mr. Chuck...

712
01:01:33,810 --> 01:01:37,210
...and neither David nor Elgin
have anything to worry about.

713
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:40,220
Let's just say...

714
01:01:40,390 --> 01:01:44,190
...that Mr. Emerald has had
what they call a little change of heart.

715
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:48,020
- But how did you know...?
- Mr. Rad knows everything...

716
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:51,190
...that goes down
in Mr. Rad's neighborhood.

717
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:54,660
- And I took care of that.
- Thank you.

718
01:01:55,330 --> 01:01:58,460
We should tell David and Elgin.
They're freaked out about it.

719
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:02,200
Oh, no, no, no. Let's just let them
keep on freaking out.

720
01:02:02,370 --> 01:02:05,210
That'll be good.
Might get some sense into their heads.

721
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:09,750
Because if they don't pull it together,
little Wade or whatever his name is...

722
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,440
...he'll walk away
with this money again for sure.

723
01:02:52,090 --> 01:02:54,690
Here's the deal.
10 crews were in the house today...

724
01:02:54,860 --> 01:02:57,990
...but only five are gonna make it
to the finals tomorrow.

725
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:00,130
And the winners are gonna appear...

726
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:06,030
...in multi-platinum recording artist...
Y'all ain't ready. Lil' Kim's video.

727
01:03:10,010 --> 01:03:11,810
There go Dave's crew right there.

728
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:15,040
Let's go, D!

729
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:07,690
That's a damn shame.

730
01:04:09,370 --> 01:04:11,960
Where your boy Saint?
Ain't he supposed to be here?

731
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:13,970
He, like, the little mascot,
ain't he?

732
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:16,770
Yeah, for sure,
but I ain't seen him all day.

733
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:32,940
Man! I'm La La. I'll be back tomorrow
for the finals, so stay tuned.

734
01:05:38,490 --> 01:05:42,430
- I knew you'd be here.
- What's up, stranger?

735
01:05:42,590 --> 01:05:45,430
So is there any brains on that menu
or common sense...

736
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,000
...you can order?
- Not now.

737
01:05:47,170 --> 01:05:51,330
When? Someone needs to let him and
El know how ridiculous they're being.

738
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:54,560
I'm gonna get with a crew myself
and make me a video...

739
01:05:54,740 --> 01:05:56,110
...and get some money.
- B?

740
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:59,710
- What?
- Can you give us a minute, please?

741
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:02,410
You want me to go sit
at a table by myself...

742
01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:03,910
...looking all lonely?

743
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:06,180
Yes. I'll be over there soon.

744
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:08,890
Fine.

745
01:06:11,190 --> 01:06:13,320
I came here to make sure
you were okay.

746
01:06:15,290 --> 01:06:18,130
I'd be a lot better if we were together.

747
01:06:20,170 --> 01:06:22,790
Look, I'm not trying to stress you.

748
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:25,500
My crew lost to EI.

749
01:06:27,270 --> 01:06:30,940
Even with all our drama,
something in me was cool with it.

750
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:33,570
I hope he wins.

751
01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:35,340
I know he needs it.

752
01:06:35,510 --> 01:06:37,910
- You seen Rico?
- I think he's with El and Vick.

753
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:40,350
We got to find Ric. Saint got shot.

754
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:42,110
- What?
- My God! What happened?

755
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:44,980
He was with Lanky and Bug
and some dude sprayed the car.

756
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:46,390
- How is he?
- Is he okay?

757
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:49,580
I heard he got hit twice,
but the hospital's giving no info.

758
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,490
- We gotta find Ric.
- I'm going.

759
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:55,100
No. I don't feel like dealing
with your brother, okay? Trust me.

760
01:07:00,070 --> 01:07:01,840
Miss, I'm looking for my brother.

761
01:07:02,010 --> 01:07:03,770
- What's his name?
- Teshawn Miller.

762
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:06,640
- We call him Lil Saint.
- Yeah.

763
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:09,970
Teshawn's family left
about an hour ago.

764
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:13,180
He's not my brother,
but blood couldn't make us any closer.

765
01:07:13,350 --> 01:07:16,380
- We need to see him, okay?
- You wait in the waiting room.

766
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:19,180
Come on, y'all.

767
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:25,760
- How's Saint?
- Did you see him yet?

768
01:07:25,930 --> 01:07:27,760
- Not yet.
- There anything we can do?

769
01:07:27,930 --> 01:07:29,560
No. We just wanna see Saint.

770
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:33,570
We're waiting to see Teshawn.

771
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:37,970
Kids, I think you should talk
to Teshawn's family.

772
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:40,870
Doc, no disrespect,
but we are Teshawn's family.

773
01:07:41,450 --> 01:07:42,940
All right?

774
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:45,580
- I can appreciate that, but...
- But what?

775
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:49,280
What, do you want it in writing?
What do I have to tell you?

776
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:53,390
I mean, he eats in my crib, I buy him
clothes, I keep him out of trouble.

777
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:55,750
I'm closer to that kid than anybody.

778
01:07:56,760 --> 01:08:00,250
Just let me go in, all right?
I just wanna let him know I'm here.

779
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:02,100
I know he's looking for me.

780
01:08:02,270 --> 01:08:05,730
Look, we'll all wait out here
if you could just let Rico go in, Doc.

781
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:07,630
Please.

782
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:11,430
Look, I'm sorry
to have to tell you this...

783
01:08:13,010 --> 01:08:15,100
...but Teshawn died a few hours ago.

784
01:08:15,350 --> 01:08:16,870
- What?
- A bullet...

785
01:08:17,050 --> 01:08:20,250
...pierced his lung and caused
severe internal bleeding.

786
01:08:20,420 --> 01:08:23,010
We tried to contain it.
We tried to revive him.

787
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:26,750
He didn't come back.

788
01:08:26,930 --> 01:08:29,490
There's nothing more we could do.

789
01:08:30,130 --> 01:08:32,320
I'm so sorry.

790
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:37,440
No, man! Just let me go!

791
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:05,420
- What's up, Ric?
- What's up?

792
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:09,000
- How you holding up, man?
- I'm all right.

793
01:09:09,170 --> 01:09:10,830
EI, I been thinking, though.

794
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,730
I was always going on to Lil Saint
about how important friendship is...

795
01:09:14,910 --> 01:09:17,640
...and how you gotta look out
for family and friends.

796
01:09:17,810 --> 01:09:19,610
You know what he would say?

797
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:22,540
He said, "Like Elgin and David do?"

798
01:09:24,650 --> 01:09:26,780
EI, I wanna be in the competition.

799
01:09:26,950 --> 01:09:28,890
You can get down with me
and my crew.

800
01:09:29,050 --> 01:09:31,350
I don't wanna just get down,
I wanna win.

801
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:33,750
That's what I'm saying.
We'll get this paper.

802
01:09:33,930 --> 01:09:35,950
It's about more than money.

803
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:39,620
Look, I wanna be the man
Lil Saint thought I was.

804
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:44,260
Hasn't losing Lil Saint made you
realize life is too short for all of this?

805
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:46,100
We need David to do it as a team.

806
01:09:46,270 --> 01:09:48,540
- Look, we don't have David.
- You could.

807
01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:51,610
I told him to come over here
so I could talk to him.

808
01:09:51,780 --> 01:09:54,440
- I said you were at Grandma's.
- You and Ric set me up?

809
01:09:54,610 --> 01:09:58,670
Look, you call it what you want, man,
but we need to end this now.

810
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:05,750
- Hey, D.
- What's up?

811
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:07,390
- What's up, Ric?
- What's up?

812
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:11,360
I stopped by Lil Saint's mom's earlier.
She not doing too good.

813
01:10:11,530 --> 01:10:13,900
I know. I just came from there.

814
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:16,090
Why am I here?

815
01:10:16,270 --> 01:10:18,260
We want you and El
to stop the madness.

816
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,530
EI, I wish you the best of luck,
all right, bro?

817
01:10:22,710 --> 01:10:24,900
Stop being so stubborn
and at least listen!

818
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:27,480
Ain't nothing to talk about.
Ain't gonna happen.

819
01:10:27,650 --> 01:10:30,950
This feud is stupid, selfish
and it affects a lot of people.

820
01:10:32,250 --> 01:10:34,950
Rico and the crew
have been down with y'all for years.

821
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:38,610
Don't they deserve the chance
to win this competition?

822
01:10:38,790 --> 01:10:41,590
And you're always talking
about how you'll help Mama.

823
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,060
If you win this, you could help her.

824
01:10:46,670 --> 01:10:50,500
You're not gonna win this competition
without David and you know it.

825
01:10:50,670 --> 01:10:54,500
Come on, y'all, let's just do it for
Lil Saint. I mean, he loved the crew.

826
01:10:54,670 --> 01:10:57,160
If he'd been in the battle
with one of y'all crews...

827
01:10:57,340 --> 01:11:00,470
...he wouldn't have been in that car.
He'd be here right now.

828
01:11:02,610 --> 01:11:05,640
But the rules say
the crews are locked down.

829
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:09,310
And you gotta compete
with whatever crew you started with.

830
01:11:09,490 --> 01:11:10,850
Dang, that's messed up.

831
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:12,780
Look, I'm sorry, Ric.

832
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:15,860
David ain't getting down with my crew
no matter what.

833
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:21,030
Wish your brother good luck for me.

834
01:11:37,550 --> 01:11:40,520
What's up, what's up? This is La La
from MTV. Check it out.

835
01:11:40,690 --> 01:11:43,550
Do you see all these people?
This is not a joke.

836
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:47,320
It is day two, the finals
of the Big Bounce Competition.

837
01:11:47,490 --> 01:11:50,260
Five of the dopest crews are left
and only one crew...

838
01:11:50,430 --> 01:11:52,800
...is going home $50,000 richer...

839
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:56,460
...and only one crew is gonna get
to appear in Lil' Kim's new video.

840
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:58,570
Hey, guys, look what we have here.

841
01:11:58,970 --> 01:12:00,160
Whatever.

842
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:02,200
Gonna use them tired-ass
moves again?

843
01:12:02,370 --> 01:12:05,670
You funny now, but you won't be
when we get on the floor.

844
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:07,870
Yeah, we'll see who gets
the last laugh.

845
01:12:08,050 --> 01:12:11,210
Do you think you know who's gonna
be the hottest crew in Cali?

846
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:13,720
You gotta stay tuned
right here to find out.

847
01:12:22,390 --> 01:12:24,560
- What's up, Vick?
- What's up, EI?

848
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,560
She just needed the official name
for the crew.

849
01:12:27,730 --> 01:12:30,000
- What did you tell her?
- We gotta get busy.

850
01:12:30,170 --> 01:12:31,860
- Where the kneepads?
- Right here.

851
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:33,500
- Y'all ready?
- Look at this.

852
01:12:33,670 --> 01:12:35,500
- All right.
- All right. You ready?

853
01:12:35,670 --> 01:12:37,230
Sure, I'm ready.

854
01:12:38,380 --> 01:12:40,340
Yeah!

855
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:44,910
Make some noise!

856
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:51,780
Ladies and gentlemen.
Man, y'all are in for a treat.

857
01:12:52,390 --> 01:12:56,260
Whichever crew wins today, you're
gonna wanna remember their faces...

858
01:12:56,430 --> 01:12:59,960
...because the next time you'll see
them will be Lil' Kim's new video.

859
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:02,290
Give it up for Lil' Kim!

860
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:12,410
Now, for those of you who don't know,
my name's Wade Robson.

861
01:13:13,710 --> 01:13:15,370
Thank you.

862
01:13:16,110 --> 01:13:19,850
Now, I've choreographed some
of the hottest videos ever to hit MTV.

863
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:23,750
I've worked with artists such as
Britney Spears, *NS YNC...

864
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:25,860
...Pink, Mya...
- He's so cute!

865
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:27,890
...Usher...
- He tight!

866
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:30,030
...but I've never seen anything...

867
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:32,430
...like what these crews
have done here.

868
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:35,500
So I want y'all to give it up
for Wade's Crew.

869
01:13:40,670 --> 01:13:43,230
Settle down, settle down,
settle down, settle down.

870
01:13:44,740 --> 01:13:47,910
All right, next up,
we got Bug and His Boys.

871
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:52,510
We got the Furious Females!

872
01:13:55,250 --> 01:13:57,520
The Pomona Pit Bulls!

873
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:00,610
Last but not least,
the Lil Saints.

874
01:14:08,370 --> 01:14:10,800
So without further ado...

875
01:14:10,970 --> 01:14:13,840
...ladies and gentleman,
it's showtime!

876
01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:21,750
Yo, yo, yo, this is wild.
This is the bomb!

877
01:14:21,910 --> 01:14:24,140
It's about to get crazy
up in here!

878
01:15:21,910 --> 01:15:25,240
Now, this right here
is what I call a real competition.

879
01:15:25,410 --> 01:15:27,900
I'm so glad
I'm not one of those judges.

880
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:30,050
This is gonna be
a really tough call.

881
01:16:37,250 --> 01:16:39,110
Settle down, settle down.

882
01:16:39,580 --> 01:16:42,420
Man, this is gonna be
a really tough decision.

883
01:16:42,590 --> 01:16:45,020
All the crews were incredible, right?

884
01:16:48,030 --> 01:16:49,930
Give them some love!
They deserve it.

885
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:52,660
Let's see what the judges think.

886
01:17:02,270 --> 01:17:04,300
That's ridiculous.
You can't do that.

887
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:06,530
What is this?

888
01:17:09,580 --> 01:17:10,810
All right, everybody.

889
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:12,750
Listen up.

890
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:14,820
All the crews were hot.

891
01:17:15,150 --> 01:17:16,550
They all did their thing.

892
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:19,190
But looks like we've got
ourselves a tie.

893
01:17:25,660 --> 01:17:27,690
Well, the winners are...

894
01:17:27,870 --> 01:17:29,300
...both Wade's Crew...

895
01:17:29,470 --> 01:17:31,590
...and the Lil Saints.

896
01:17:34,940 --> 01:17:37,530
That's wack.
We ain't tied with these busters.

897
01:17:37,710 --> 01:17:39,900
You're right,
because we're better than you.

898
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:41,840
Man, better than you'll ever be.

899
01:17:46,050 --> 01:17:47,520
Look, listen to me.

900
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:50,310
You cannot do this to these boys.

901
01:17:50,490 --> 01:17:53,510
This ain't just a prize to them.
This is bigger than that.

902
01:17:53,690 --> 01:17:57,290
This is Tyson and Holyfield to them.
You gotta pick a winner.

903
01:17:57,460 --> 01:17:58,660
He's right.

904
01:17:58,830 --> 01:18:03,200
- But what do you want me to do?
- These dudes are gonna fight.

905
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,830
What did I tell you?
Get over there!

906
01:18:07,340 --> 01:18:10,210
Wait a minute!
What's the matter with you?

907
01:18:10,370 --> 01:18:11,810
Look...

908
01:18:11,980 --> 01:18:16,070
...Little Miss Kim, trust me on this.
You have to let these boys battle it out.

909
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:19,110
Listen, this how it work.
This is crew against crew.

910
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:21,010
Just like we do it on the streets.

911
01:18:22,290 --> 01:18:24,550
- Streets?
- Just like that.

912
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:26,790
See, now you're talking.

913
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:28,790
- That what I'm talking about.
- Yeah.

914
01:18:29,390 --> 01:18:31,050
All right, everybody.

915
01:18:31,230 --> 01:18:33,590
We decided to take it to the streets!

916
01:18:39,870 --> 01:18:44,030
These two crews are gonna battle
it out for you, straight street-style.

917
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:50,870
Listen up...

918
01:18:51,050 --> 01:18:52,610
...y'all tear this mother up.

919
01:18:52,780 --> 01:18:54,750
Get grimy and dirty.

920
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:57,550
Straight street.

921
01:18:57,720 --> 01:19:01,350
- How street you want us to get?
- You know how I like it, baby.

922
01:19:01,530 --> 01:19:02,750
Straight hood.

923
01:19:03,230 --> 01:19:04,420
No rules?

924
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:07,890
Hell, no. Just do the damn thing.
No rules.

925
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:13,890
- So y'all adding people to the party?
- What, you got a problem with it?

926
01:19:14,070 --> 01:19:17,100
I'm cool. Remember, no rules.

927
01:19:19,410 --> 01:19:21,570
Let's do this!

928
01:19:34,260 --> 01:19:36,780
Hey, Oscar, what's up, man?
Thanks for coming.

929
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:39,900
- Thought you don't battle no more.
- This isn't about that.

930
01:19:40,060 --> 01:19:42,620
It's about Lil Saint and your crew.
It's all love.

931
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:47,930
- Hey, Marty, what-what?
- What-what.

932
01:19:48,110 --> 01:19:49,330
Yeah.

933
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:51,900
- Let's go, let's go!
- We got this.

934
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:57,510
Still missing one by my count.

935
01:19:58,620 --> 01:20:00,010
All right, let's do this.

936
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:02,180
- No, we got it.
- EI.

937
01:20:02,350 --> 01:20:04,320
Come on, let's bury this.
Let me help.

938
01:20:04,490 --> 01:20:07,180
Look, EI, it's either David
and all of us...

939
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:09,190
...or it's none of us.

940
01:20:09,790 --> 01:20:12,690
EI, remember, man, we're a team.

941
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:26,910
Let's do this.

942
01:20:30,450 --> 01:20:32,970
Okay, here's how it's gonna go down.

943
01:20:33,150 --> 01:20:35,480
The beat will play for five minutes.

944
01:20:35,650 --> 01:20:37,590
When I yell "stop," that's it.

945
01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:39,080
Then...

946
01:20:39,260 --> 01:20:42,780
...the audience will decide
who's gonna take home the money...

947
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:45,860
...and who's gonna be
in my new video.

948
01:20:46,030 --> 01:20:49,520
So may the dopest crew win.

949
01:20:49,700 --> 01:20:53,070
DJ, drop it like it's hot.

950
01:21:00,540 --> 01:21:03,880
All right, listen up, y'all.
Listen up, y'all.

951
01:21:04,050 --> 01:21:07,110
God, now that Lil Saint's with you,
we ask you to bless him.

952
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:10,010
We ask you to bless our family,
our friends, our crew.

953
01:21:10,190 --> 01:21:13,320
- Give us the strength to win this battle.
- Amen!

954
01:21:13,490 --> 01:21:15,420
In your name we pray. Amen.

955
01:21:15,590 --> 01:21:18,720
Lil Saint, this one's for you, baby!
Let's go!

956
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:23,000
Back off, back off, back off!

957
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:30,730
Yeah! That was insane.

958
01:26:30,910 --> 01:26:32,240
Man, that's love.

959
01:26:32,410 --> 01:26:35,740
All right, settle down, settle down.
Settle down.

960
01:26:35,910 --> 01:26:37,110
Settle down!

961
01:26:38,580 --> 01:26:39,810
Settle down.

962
01:26:39,980 --> 01:26:43,380
Man, both crews were incredible.
It's ridiculous.

963
01:26:43,550 --> 01:26:46,080
Damn, my heart's beating fast too.
That was crazy.

964
01:26:46,260 --> 01:26:49,550
Right now we're about to find out
who's the best on the scene.

965
01:26:49,730 --> 01:26:51,060
First up...

966
01:26:51,230 --> 01:26:54,130
...I want y'all to give it up
for Wade's Crew!

967
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:02,900
Okay, okay. Nice.
Settle down a little bit.

968
01:27:03,070 --> 01:27:04,330
Next...

969
01:27:04,870 --> 01:27:06,770
...the Lil Saints!

970
01:27:15,890 --> 01:27:19,820
Yeah! All right. All right.

971
01:27:20,590 --> 01:27:24,180
All right, settle down! Settle down.

972
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:25,620
All right.

973
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:28,760
Lil' Kim and myself would like
to present the Lil Saints...

974
01:27:28,930 --> 01:27:32,660
...with the Big Bounce $50,000 award!

975
01:28:02,970 --> 01:28:06,530
- You did it, man.
- No, we did it.

976
01:28:07,640 --> 01:28:09,540
EI, my boy.

977
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:12,270
Congratulations!

978
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:14,000
Holler.

979
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:20,880
That's all you got for your girl?

980
01:28:38,300 --> 01:28:40,170
Yo, this is bullshit, man.
We had you.

981
01:28:40,370 --> 01:28:43,360
- This ain't over yet.
- It is now, baby boy.

982
01:28:44,970 --> 01:28:47,500
Y'all just mad. Because today...

983
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:49,710
...you suckers got served.

984
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:51,640
