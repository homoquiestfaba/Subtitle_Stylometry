1
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:40,652
Speak up, boy,
'fore I lay into you.

2
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:46,291
There's three of 'em.
Two is men.

3
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:47,693
And inside?

4
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:50,729
Just an old white woman.

5
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,867
You sure, now?

6
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:59,905
But she got a shotgun.

7
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,507
Well,

8
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:06,445
you boys try not
to piss yourselves.

9
00:04:11,986 --> 00:04:13,652
Hyah! Hyah!

10
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:18,957
Watch it!

11
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,893
- Watch it!
- Watch it!

12
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:23,762
Okay, let's go!

13
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:33,405
- Get up!
- Come on!

14
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,608
Come on. Come on.

15
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,977
That's money is what that is.

16
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:38,870
That nigger's worth $600,
and you ain't.

17
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,808
You owe that boy an apology.

18
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:45,744
I'm sorry, Burrell, for...

19
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:47,446
Don't tell me.

20
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,953
I apologize.

21
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:02,961
This lost property is
to be protected until returned.

22
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:11,163
I got three rolled.
Pay me first.

23
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:13,165
Last time you ain't pay me.

24
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:32,184
Make sure
your uncle shares that.

25
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:50,535
You ain't thank me.

26
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:53,872
Thank you, Marcus.

27
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:58,543
Ain't no need
to be countin', boy.

28
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:01,513
Don't I provide
when no one else did?

29
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:03,815
You welcome to set out
on your own.

30
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:11,656
Go on now. Feed them niggers.

31
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,725
It's your turn.

32
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,250
Y'all thirsty?

33
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,300
I got something for you.

34
00:08:56,969 --> 00:09:00,205
Name of the man
you're looking for is Nate.

35
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:07,023
He's diggin' graves for the
Federals near Petersburg.

36
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:10,615
About three, four nights
from here by foot.

37
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:16,219
I don't reckon I'd be
welcome anyplace near.

38
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,892
And this nigger just gonna
happily walk his self back south?

39
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:27,599
Well, they buried his brother not
two months ago down in Leesville.

40
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,635
News ain't made it up there.

41
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:35,106
You'll think of somethin'.

42
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:45,784
How 'bout you give me
50 for the boy?

43
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:49,888
In case I don't make it back.

44
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:53,625
Even if I do, he'd be yours.

45
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:57,295
He can cook, tend horses.

46
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:59,664
Should keep the boy.

47
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,700
Might need him.

48
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:05,203
Besides, you do this right, you're gonna
need help carryin' all that gold.

49
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:24,741
There's a lot of country
between here and there.

50
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,362
And to the north
and south of either place.

51
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:34,165
And out west.

52
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:42,240
If a man don't want to be found,
there's many places he can go.

53
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:47,379
Where you can go.

54
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:55,120
Don't matter.

55
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:02,761
If you don't bring this nigger
back exactly how I say,

56
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:05,296
I'll find you
and put you in the ground,

57
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:07,799
along with the boy...

58
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:10,001
and everybody else
you ever knew.

59
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:03,922
Wake up.

60
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,880
Why we goin' so far
for just one runaway?

61
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:31,883
Can leave you here
if you don't like it.

62
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:33,852
Makes no difference.

63
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:40,097
Why can't we just...
Money's why.

64
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:44,796
And this one's worth more than
them other three put together.

65
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:50,835
I'll take that.

66
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,061
Who you think
used to live here?

67
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:19,397
Now just keep quiet and listen.

68
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:22,367
When we get back with him,
we stay the last night...

69
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:33,344
When we get back with him,
we stay the last night here.

70
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:36,314
When you get up, you go get
Burrell 'fore that nigger wakes.

71
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,883
They not a mile that way.

72
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:42,187
And I don't want no talkin' about how you
been here before or none of that shit.

73
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:43,822
Understand?

74
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:46,524
Good. Go on.

75
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:02,207
Get down on the ground.
Lay down there. What?

76
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:05,043
Boy, get down on the ground
like you sleepin'.

77
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:10,915
Now get up
and get out that door.

78
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,923
So I can't hear ya.

79
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,613
Again.

80
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:50,588
You ain't asleep.
So you hear everything.

81
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,323
Goddamn it, boy.

82
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:56,394
Again.

83
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:42,974
If he's got a knife or something, we gotta
take it from him while he's sleepin'.

84
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,344
This ain't like sneakin' out
the other night...

85
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:48,680
when they was scared and they
ain't had nowhere else to go.

86
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,050
This one's somethin' else.

87
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:55,406
Go on, now.

88
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,251
Your name Nate, sir?

89
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:15,560
I-I'm Will from...

90
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,698
That's my Uncle Marcus.

91
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,400
From around Leesville.

92
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:29,240
We come on account
of your brother, Samuel?

93
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,809
He got consumption.

94
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:34,278
He ain't well.

95
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,680
Say he ain't gonna last long.

96
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:39,784
Can't go back down there.

97
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:42,186
Your brother said...

98
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:46,224
he wants to see you
before he goes.

99
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:48,860
- He ask us to tell you that.
- How'd you find me?

100
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:54,156
Your brother heard you was here.
I don't know how.

101
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,501
When was this?

102
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:58,302
Three days back.

103
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:02,206
And you just took it upon
yourself to deliver the word?

104
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:06,811
His master, Pritchards, tasked
us with it, and we'll be paid.

105
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,615
Say he ain't got long.
He just wants to see you.

106
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:21,592
Should we tell
your brother somethin'?

107
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,382
'Bout why you ain't
come back for him?

108
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:36,574
Y'all from Leesville?

109
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:40,711
Huh. He in a bad way?

110
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,816
I'll see to it when I can.

111
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:48,619
We should all
head back together.

112
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:51,656
Can we journey back with you?

113
00:19:51,658 --> 00:19:54,625
The two of you make it up
here on your own? Yes, sir.

114
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:58,296
Then... I figure you can make
it back down on your own too.

115
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:01,566
Well, we won't be a bother.

116
00:20:01,568 --> 00:20:04,602
Besides, we came
all this way for you.

117
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:08,739
We'll leave before sunup.

118
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:11,742
And we stay off the roads.

119
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:15,346
I can't be liable
for foolish children.

120
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,550
Now, go on.

121
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,872
You want my advice, we'll make it
there in three days if we head up...

122
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:44,354
Don't want your advice.

123
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,512
Well, you need it,
ornery bastard.

124
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:53,884
- You headed that way?

125
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:55,486
Yeah.

126
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:58,956
You welcome to take
any path you want.

127
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,002
Marcus know the best way.

128
00:21:11,004 --> 00:21:13,037
You ain't got nothin'
to worry about.

129
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:27,818
You ever seen
a cannon shoot off?

130
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:31,389
I've heard 'em lots.

131
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:33,357
Just never seen 'em.

132
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:42,466
-Why do you think... -Didn't your mama ever
teach you to shut up and listen sometime?

133
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:45,336
I never knew my mama.

134
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,742
How long has it been
since you run up north?

135
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,847
I ain't a runaway.

136
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:23,107
That's too much
for you to be carryin', boy.

137
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:26,877
My father gave me that.

138
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:29,680
I don't give a damn
who gave it to you.

139
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:32,516
I ain't spending it
till I see him next.

140
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:44,829
Yeah, keep on rubbin'
that thing.

141
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:47,732
Shine it up.

142
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:51,535
You rub that thing half as good as you
was rubbin' your johnson last night,

143
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:53,871
it'll shine right up.

144
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:57,541
Might even blind a man.
He's  lyin'.

145
00:22:57,543 --> 00:23:01,445
Hell, he could rub the eagle right off
the back of that coin till it's smooth.

146
00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:03,714
Least he's good at one thing.

147
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,850
I was a professional
at his age.

148
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:13,150
They's stuck on your back.

149
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:24,662
Why they stick like that?

150
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:28,699
Don't serve no purpose.

151
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:31,469
It's a seed.

152
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:33,804
That way they travel further
than they could on their own.

153
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:42,171
But why do they... You
wearin' me out, boy.

154
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,582
- Well, I just...
- Shh.

155
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,487
Hear that?

156
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:54,959
- No. What's it sound like?
- Keep listenin'.

157
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:57,261
Very quiet.

158
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:06,237
- Was that it?
- Ah!

159
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:23,821
Why we takin' him back to
Burrell if he ain't a runaway?

160
00:25:23,823 --> 00:25:25,256
What?

161
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:29,193
He owe Burrell money.

162
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:31,629
And they might have to
rough him up to get it,

163
00:25:31,631 --> 00:25:33,531
so stop getting
all friendly with him.

164
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:40,804
Maybe he'll just pay up
so they won't have to.

165
00:25:40,806 --> 00:25:42,740
He made his choices.

166
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,878
And don't forget
what we stand to collect.

167
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:51,982
Tonight, you try and
sneak out in the night.

168
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:54,464
See how good he sleeps.

169
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:15,639
Boy, you best get up
and get some more.

170
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:36,193
We over here crackin' teeth,

171
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:39,830
and this nigger eatin' pork?

172
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:47,071
You know, a man can share.

173
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:49,673
You're right.

174
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:30,114
What's it like
diggin' for the Federals?

175
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:37,121
It don't seem no different from
diggin' for a master down south.

176
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:40,991
You seen me ask any man's
permission to leave?

177
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:44,962
You work hard,
you're your own man.

178
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:50,258
I don't need no one and
don't look out for no one.

179
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:56,140
Marcus and I
look out for each other...

180
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:01,378
ever since the army
burned down the master's farm.

181
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:04,148
Doin' what it takes to get by.

182
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:08,419
We's family, you know?

183
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:13,090
I knew my ma
for about two hours,

184
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:16,727
and my father was a sumbitch.

185
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,098
Father went north
two years back,

186
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,167
but he's comin' back for me.

187
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:25,436
Boy, that's bullshit
and you know it.

188
00:28:25,438 --> 00:28:27,705
Comin' back
down south for you...

189
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:30,474
is the last thing
on the man's mind.

190
00:28:30,476 --> 00:28:32,976
Keep quiet
and let a nigger sleep.

191
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:02,332
Where you goin'?

192
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:09,406
I-I got to piss.

193
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,178
Then go right there.

194
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:17,881
You ain't got to spend 10 minutes standin'
up and then walk a mile out in the woods.

195
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:26,323
Well?

196
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:30,594
Well, I can't with you watchin'.
Tsk.

197
00:30:30,596 --> 00:30:33,997
Oh, shit, boy.

198
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,521
Hold on now.

199
00:31:31,523 --> 00:31:34,291
Where you goin'?

200
00:31:34,293 --> 00:31:37,461
- Just hold up now.
- You stole some of my salt pork.

201
00:31:37,463 --> 00:31:40,497
- I'll make my own way from here on.
- Man, I ain't eat your food.

202
00:31:40,499 --> 00:31:43,267
I knowed you was a thief.

203
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:45,749
You don't know a goddamn thing.

204
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:48,939
What, you think
I stole that shit?

205
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,508
Why?

206
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:55,078
You smell it on my breath? Huh?

207
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:57,514
Huh?

208
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,154
You smell it on my breath?

209
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:11,128
Come on, nigger.
Teach me a lesson.

210
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:14,665
Just wait up now.

211
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:17,067
Come on, boy. Grab the shit.
Let's go.

212
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:23,633
Take water if you need. The
rest belongs to their kinfolk.

213
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:30,140
Damn, if you ain't
an uppity nigger.

214
00:33:30,142 --> 00:33:33,677
Slave for the Union
is still just a slave.

215
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:37,347
- He ain't like other men I seen.
- Yeah.

216
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:41,151
He's worth more.
And don't you forget.

217
00:33:41,153 --> 00:33:43,186
What if it was you?

218
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:45,589
Well, it ain't.

219
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:52,763
Look at me, boy.

220
00:33:54,265 --> 00:33:55,632
Look at me.

221
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:01,238
You wanna go back
to sellin' tobacco for pennies?

222
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:05,108
Now,

223
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:07,611
you can live hand to mouth
for the rest of your life.

224
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,280
Or...

225
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:13,483
you can make some money.

226
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:17,521
Maybe even enough
to find your daddy.

227
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:26,790
Get down, boy.

228
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:30,152
When I was your age, I was climbin'
like that and broke a leg.

229
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:33,330
How's it now?

230
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,633
It's fine now.

231
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:40,203
Well, if it ain't a problem,
I'll keep climbin'.

232
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:53,283
I always make you mad, don't I?

233
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,856
Can you throw that?

234
00:35:59,858 --> 00:36:01,625
Show me how.

235
00:36:01,627 --> 00:36:03,727
Go on. Climb that tree.

236
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,937
Got any other family?

237
00:36:13,939 --> 00:36:15,639
Besides your brother?

238
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,410
Nothin'?

239
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:25,782
I had a woman...
not too far from here.

240
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:30,487
Wasn't no words spoken over us,
but she was my woman.

241
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,657
No children?

242
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:38,929
We had a child.

243
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:44,534
Probably be a little older than
you, but he ain't make it.

244
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:49,539
You don't see her no more?

245
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:52,642
Best this way.

246
00:36:52,644 --> 00:36:54,744
Got nothin' weighin' me down.

247
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:59,316
- So what was her name?
- Rachel.

248
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,253
There's a lot of Rachels
out there.

249
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:09,492
Lord, I known
a lot of Rachels in my day.

250
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:14,965
Where you say
your Rachel's from?

251
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,469
We rested long enough.

252
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:23,673
I'll fill this up,
then we'll keep on.

253
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:26,409
I'll fill it for you.

254
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:51,179
This'll do for tonight.

255
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,341
Come on. Let's get some wood.

256
00:37:58,343 --> 00:38:00,043
No fire tonight.

257
00:38:00,045 --> 00:38:02,979
We're too far from Union lines
and don't need the attention.

258
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:06,016
Well, I'm makin' a fire.

259
00:38:06,018 --> 00:38:09,019
If you don't like it, you can
freeze your ass on down the way.

260
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:15,358
Get up.

261
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,395
Let him be.
The boy's feet ain't good.

262
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:23,633
Come on now, boy.

263
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:32,855
You gonna have to be
your own man someday.

264
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:41,985
Maybe we can do
something nice for him...

265
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:46,556
'fore we turn him in.

266
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:53,797
You think you good,
but you ain't.

267
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:57,519
You'd do the same thing
if you was me.

268
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,844
Can't we just...

269
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,047
ask him for the money
he owe Burrell?

270
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:17,887
- Huh?
- Goddamn it, boy.

271
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:20,757
Burrell don't want
money from him.

272
00:39:20,759 --> 00:39:24,427
Nate done killed a man, and Burrell's
gonna kill him to get the bounty.

273
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:30,133
Now, I'd do it
for the money myself,

274
00:39:30,135 --> 00:39:32,502
but Burrell will kill me
and you both...

275
00:39:32,504 --> 00:39:34,824
if we don't deliver him
exactly how he say.

276
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:38,007
Stop talkin' to that old man...

277
00:39:38,009 --> 00:39:41,778
'fore he figure us out and we got to kill
him and drag his dead ass all the way back.

278
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:50,053
This ain't
just about the money.

279
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:51,988
It's about your life.

280
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:54,457
Nate's a dead man
and can't nobody help him.

281
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:26,689
What is it, boy?

282
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:31,995
You ain't sleepin'?

283
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:38,902
I can't always sleep neither.

284
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:51,915
All of a sudden you quiet?

285
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,097
Where's Nate?

286
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,248
Get the boy!

287
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:22,138
Hyah!

288
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,355
All right. All right.

289
00:43:12,357 --> 00:43:14,657
Get down. All right.

290
00:43:25,803 --> 00:43:27,704
Aaah!

291
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:53,730
All right, come on.

292
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,642
All right, now,
let's have a look.

293
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,731
Come on.

294
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:04,300
We'll get you right.

295
00:45:15,145 --> 00:45:17,447
This just
so we ain't slowed down.

296
00:45:17,449 --> 00:45:20,183
You do everything I say
or I'll leave you.

297
00:45:20,185 --> 00:45:21,784
Understand?

298
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,489
Come on. You're all right.

299
00:45:26,491 --> 00:45:28,391
We only got two
or three more nights.

300
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:44,807
There used to be
some freedmen livin' out here.

301
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:18,601
We appreciate you havin' us
on such a night.

302
00:47:18,603 --> 00:47:21,037
Your son look hungrier
than you are.

303
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,719
Me and your uncle didn't
always get on well,

304
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:51,133
but it was kind of him to come
tell me the word about my brother.

305
00:47:51,135 --> 00:47:53,569
He died doin' a good thing.

306
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:00,476
When the soldiers came,
he tried to save himself.

307
00:48:05,015 --> 00:48:07,250
Why'd you come back for me?

308
00:48:41,018 --> 00:48:43,119
What's your name?

309
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:45,288
Will.

310
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:48,591
William.

311
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:51,460
William sounds old.

312
00:48:52,562 --> 00:48:55,631
They call me Abby,
instead of Abigail.

313
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:05,308
Who's that man you with?

314
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:07,343
He kin to you?

315
00:49:07,345 --> 00:49:09,078
Just a man.

316
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,013
Just a man?

317
00:49:16,987 --> 00:49:19,255
That's cold, boy!

318
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:21,557
You stayin' here?

319
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:24,727
You should stay here.

320
00:49:26,997 --> 00:49:28,431
Huh?

321
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:33,235
How come?

322
00:49:33,237 --> 00:49:35,171
Where you goin'?

323
00:49:38,008 --> 00:49:40,328
There ain't much other
children round here.

324
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:43,346
I ain't children.

325
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:47,650
Ready?

326
00:50:34,598 --> 00:50:36,532
We gettin' closer now.

327
00:50:37,734 --> 00:50:39,702
I can't be seen in these parts.

328
00:51:04,628 --> 00:51:06,228
All right.

329
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:11,300
When you throw it,
hold your arm straight out.

330
00:51:11,302 --> 00:51:13,536
Let's see how you do.

331
00:51:13,538 --> 00:51:15,137
Come on.

332
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:17,239
Come on.

333
00:51:19,176 --> 00:51:20,843
You used a hammer?

334
00:51:20,845 --> 00:51:23,279
Hold it like that.

335
00:51:23,281 --> 00:51:24,680
Lower.

336
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:31,520
What's wrong with you, boy?

337
00:51:31,522 --> 00:51:33,422
Come on, now.

338
00:51:34,624 --> 00:51:37,560
Pick a tree, not too far.

339
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:41,430
Boy, what's wrong with you?

340
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:43,399
Come on. Pick a tree.

341
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:51,893
Marcus didn't steal
your salt pork.

342
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:55,344
It was me.

343
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:09,158
I'd have give it to you
had you asked me.

344
00:52:15,732 --> 00:52:17,399
Nate.

345
00:52:17,401 --> 00:52:19,235
I...

346
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:22,138
I got to tell you...

347
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:31,614
If they see us, you just run.

348
00:52:31,616 --> 00:52:33,549
Don't look back.

349
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:43,792
You got any other family
round Leesville?

350
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:50,292
When we get back,
what you gonna do?

351
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:55,798
I do odd jobs for a white man.

352
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:59,335
I'm savin' up to go look for
my pa if he ain't back soon.

353
00:53:59,337 --> 00:54:01,837
What kind of jobs?

354
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:04,673
Different things
up and down the Nottoway.

355
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:08,644
I thought you said
you was from Leesville.

356
00:54:08,646 --> 00:54:10,246
No.

357
00:54:11,514 --> 00:54:12,915
I-I am.

358
00:54:14,517 --> 00:54:17,019
It ain't too far from there.

359
00:54:38,575 --> 00:54:40,676
I saw you talkin'
to that girl back there.

360
00:54:42,312 --> 00:54:45,014
You ever had a girl of your own?
No.

361
00:54:45,016 --> 00:54:46,949
Don't.

362
00:54:46,951 --> 00:54:48,751
They trouble.

363
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,888
Not all of 'em.
Yeah. All of 'em.

364
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:58,594
But they worth it.

365
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:46,635
I'm bringin' him.

366
00:56:46,637 --> 00:56:48,404
I done like Burrell said.

367
00:56:48,406 --> 00:56:50,506
We ain't ridin'
with Burrell no more.

368
00:56:54,677 --> 00:56:57,546
Son of a bitch killed Hayden
two days ago.

369
00:57:00,617 --> 00:57:02,418
He ain't right.

370
00:57:09,659 --> 00:57:12,027
We found your boy.

371
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:27,042
Where you two headed?

372
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:31,113
I got a brother sick
down in Leesville.

373
00:57:31,115 --> 00:57:33,048
We headed down that way.

374
00:57:34,217 --> 00:57:35,784
Ain't we?

375
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:40,055
Y'all look to be
in a sorry state.

376
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:45,959
I ain't like to see men like that...
niggers or not.

377
00:57:49,065 --> 00:57:52,201
Might as well
make our way together.

378
00:57:52,203 --> 00:57:55,537
That's kind,
but we'll be all right.

379
00:57:56,906 --> 00:57:59,208
We'll just keep alongside,
if it suits you.

380
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:04,947
I don't give a damn
if it suits him.

381
00:58:18,229 --> 00:58:20,229
Stop!

382
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:33,609
I warned him.

383
00:59:13,016 --> 00:59:15,751
We only got one more night
after this.

384
00:59:15,753 --> 00:59:18,687
So I guess we'll just
make do tomorrow.

385
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:42,596
You saved me back there.

386
00:59:43,947 --> 00:59:46,148
I was savin' myself.

387
00:59:53,289 --> 00:59:55,190
You had a woman near here?

388
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:59,261
Yeah.

389
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,967
Y'all ain't never had
another child together?

390
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:08,429
It ain't always that simple.

391
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:13,674
But them times was all right.

392
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:23,719
You ever killed a man
before yesterday?

393
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:27,222
Mmm.

394
01:00:33,262 --> 01:00:35,764
'Bout six years back,
my master died.

395
01:00:38,735 --> 01:00:41,970
His wife left for Boston
and set me free when she did.

396
01:00:44,674 --> 01:00:48,710
So I headed up north to earn money
to buy out my woman from her master.

397
01:00:52,015 --> 01:00:54,850
But a couple of pattyrollers
tried to take me back.

398
01:00:58,721 --> 01:01:00,822
I showed 'em my papers.

399
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:08,163
I killed one of 'em.

400
01:01:08,165 --> 01:01:11,133
Maybe I ain't have to,
but I did.

401
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:17,906
After hidin' out
near five years,

402
01:01:17,908 --> 01:01:20,108
I lost touch with my woman.

403
01:01:22,078 --> 01:01:25,047
She ain't but five miles
down that way... or was.

404
01:01:31,888 --> 01:01:34,169
Probably should've
never left her.

405
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:43,298
I miss her,
but it can't be helped.

406
01:01:51,909 --> 01:01:55,310
I ain't never told no one
'bout that before.

407
01:01:57,346 --> 01:01:59,347
Why didn't you
send word to her,

408
01:02:01,084 --> 01:02:02,918
tell her what happened?

409
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:07,789
It ain't safe
knowin' a man like me.

410
01:02:07,791 --> 01:02:10,058
I'd have wanted to know
what happened.

411
01:02:16,332 --> 01:02:19,067
That night before
my father went north,

412
01:02:22,305 --> 01:02:25,440
we fought over somethin'...
what I can't even remember now.

413
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:35,484
I wish I hadn't done that.

414
01:02:35,486 --> 01:02:39,154
I ain't sure he'd be too
happy to see me these days.

415
01:02:42,992 --> 01:02:44,826
He'd be proud of you.

416
01:02:51,167 --> 01:02:53,135
I got something to say.

417
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:01,810
If you gotta do something...

418
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:05,781
you don't want to,

419
01:03:08,551 --> 01:03:10,919
that you know is wrong,

420
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:14,055
but you ain't got
no choice in it,

421
01:03:19,829 --> 01:03:21,863
are you goin' to hell?

422
01:03:21,865 --> 01:03:23,532
I don't know.

423
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:28,028
You ain't got no choice,
you ain't got no choice.

424
01:03:30,206 --> 01:03:32,566
Most times, we got a choice.

425
01:03:55,398 --> 01:03:56,998
Nate?

426
01:04:06,943 --> 01:04:09,144
Nate?

427
01:04:09,146 --> 01:04:10,579
Nate!

428
01:04:18,054 --> 01:04:19,988
You thought I left you?

429
01:04:22,992 --> 01:04:24,326
I wouldn't leave you.

430
01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:29,898
But I might
if you don't bathe soon.

431
01:04:40,476 --> 01:04:42,944
Maybe we should stop by
to see your woman.

432
01:04:43,913 --> 01:04:45,347
What?

433
01:04:45,349 --> 01:04:47,349
We gotta keep movin'.

434
01:04:48,184 --> 01:04:50,285
It ain't too far.

435
01:04:50,287 --> 01:04:53,054
Don't talk 'bout that no more.

436
01:05:06,669 --> 01:05:09,037
I don't know
what the hell I'm doin'.

437
01:05:10,273 --> 01:05:11,673
Be quiet.

438
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:15,510
I should just
head on out of here.

439
01:05:15,512 --> 01:05:17,479
We done decided.

440
01:05:21,017 --> 01:05:23,385
She don't want to see me
after all this time.

441
01:05:23,387 --> 01:05:25,287
And I don't care nohow.

442
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:28,657
Yes, you do.

443
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:52,547
Yeah?

444
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:58,253
There a woman name
of Rachel around here?

445
01:05:58,255 --> 01:06:01,389
Rachel live here.

446
01:06:01,391 --> 01:06:04,392
Sundays she go to town
with the master's wife.

447
01:06:04,394 --> 01:06:07,128
Sometimes they spend the night.

448
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:09,531
I think she'll
be back this evening.

449
01:06:13,369 --> 01:06:15,337
You was her man?

450
01:06:17,606 --> 01:06:19,574
I's her man now.

451
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:25,591
I don't think she'd be
wantin' to see you nohow.

452
01:06:26,215 --> 01:06:28,450
I heard about you.

453
01:06:28,452 --> 01:06:30,552
What'd you hear?

454
01:06:30,554 --> 01:06:33,254
Just that you was set free.

455
01:06:33,256 --> 01:06:36,736
You went up north. You never
come back like you said.

456
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:49,571
She kept these.

457
01:06:49,573 --> 01:06:52,040
I ain't too fond
of lookin' at 'em,

458
01:06:52,042 --> 01:06:54,009
if you want 'em.

459
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:59,314
She kept them all this time?

460
01:06:59,316 --> 01:07:01,750
I don't know if I's supposed
to give 'em to you.

461
01:07:01,752 --> 01:07:04,252
She kept 'em so long.

462
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:09,257
A man's boots is a man's boots,

463
01:07:09,259 --> 01:07:11,593
but she might not like me
givin' 'em to you.

464
01:07:15,298 --> 01:07:18,266
I never know what she thinkin'.

465
01:07:18,268 --> 01:07:21,069
Sometime her mood turn,
she let me hear about it.

466
01:07:21,071 --> 01:07:23,538
She used to
let me hear about it.

467
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:26,775
Sometimes I think the whole county could
hear about it once she got goin'.

468
01:07:26,777 --> 01:07:29,144
Hell, you probably know
all about that too.

469
01:07:29,146 --> 01:07:31,413
Lord knows I sure do.

470
01:07:31,415 --> 01:07:33,681
She's somethin' else.

471
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:40,755
Hell, you should probably
stay and talk a while.

472
01:07:40,757 --> 01:07:43,958
You probably got all kinds
of stories to tell.

473
01:07:52,601 --> 01:07:56,237
Well, I'll tell her
you come by.

474
01:08:00,509 --> 01:08:02,377
Yeah.

475
01:08:12,154 --> 01:08:14,656
We can wait.

476
01:08:14,658 --> 01:08:17,125
She might be back this evening.

477
01:08:17,127 --> 01:08:21,229
No. We should push on.

478
01:08:21,231 --> 01:08:23,498
We could reach my brother
by tomorrow afternoon.

479
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:09,277
Rachel.

480
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:11,546
Now?

481
01:09:11,548 --> 01:09:13,615
Now?

482
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:16,818
Tell me.

483
01:09:18,787 --> 01:09:20,755
Tell me. All right.

484
01:09:25,494 --> 01:09:27,395
I went up north like I said.

485
01:09:27,397 --> 01:09:30,198
You was supposed
to come back for me.

486
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:32,800
Why didn't you come back?

487
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:40,175
You could have
told me something.

488
01:09:55,257 --> 01:09:57,659
So you responsible
for that boy now?

489
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:04,299
You ain't worth a damn.

490
01:10:05,367 --> 01:10:07,468
Comin' back here now.

491
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:13,274
Come here, boy.

492
01:10:15,477 --> 01:10:18,246
Look at you... all filthy.

493
01:10:18,248 --> 01:10:20,548
Moth-eaten.

494
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:23,751
I wouldn't expect no more from him,
but somebody gotta take care of you.

495
01:10:23,753 --> 01:10:25,787
- We been traveling...
- Don't.

496
01:10:25,789 --> 01:10:27,689
Don't talk at me.

497
01:10:30,292 --> 01:10:31,793
I'm all right.

498
01:10:31,795 --> 01:10:33,361
You all right?

499
01:10:35,531 --> 01:10:38,600
He ain't got nobody?

500
01:10:38,602 --> 01:10:41,836
If he ain't got nobody, just leave
him here till they figure somethin'.

501
01:10:41,838 --> 01:10:44,739
I... I got people.

502
01:10:44,741 --> 01:10:47,242
You got people.

503
01:10:47,244 --> 01:10:48,643
Kin?

504
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:52,880
Lord.

505
01:10:53,949 --> 01:10:56,884
You sure you ain't his son?

506
01:10:56,886 --> 01:10:59,387
'Cause you
just as much trouble.

507
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:06,728
We should get on now.

508
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:12,333
Don't make me no difference.

509
01:12:00,350 --> 01:12:01,749
What's wrong?

510
01:12:09,792 --> 01:12:11,693
We need to eat.

511
01:12:15,764 --> 01:12:18,766
There's stores
at the crossroads.

512
01:12:18,768 --> 01:12:21,069
Some sell to Negroes.

513
01:12:21,071 --> 01:12:23,004
I can't be seen up there.

514
01:12:26,475 --> 01:12:29,844
This is just enough to get us
hardtack and venison for tonight.

515
01:12:29,846 --> 01:12:31,579
I'll be here.

516
01:12:35,117 --> 01:12:36,684
Be careful.

517
01:12:59,007 --> 01:13:00,575
This too?

518
01:13:13,155 --> 01:13:15,857
This ain't enough.

519
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,134
You got whiskey?

520
01:13:49,992 --> 01:13:51,826
What's all this?

521
01:13:53,796 --> 01:13:55,763
So you ain't too cold.

522
01:13:57,933 --> 01:14:00,868
You spent your pa's
double eagle?

523
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:07,675
I'll give this to my brother.

524
01:14:07,677 --> 01:14:09,911
It could be a comfort to him.

525
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:13,080
Drink some now.

526
01:14:26,862 --> 01:14:28,996
We made it, didn't we?

527
01:14:45,147 --> 01:14:48,308
I don't know about seeing my
brother after all this time.

528
01:14:49,618 --> 01:14:51,552
I don't know.

529
01:14:53,922 --> 01:14:56,858
Things ain't always happen the
way they supposed to with him.

530
01:14:56,860 --> 01:14:58,793
Or with me.

531
01:15:00,629 --> 01:15:03,064
I ain't really lived
like I should.

532
01:15:03,899 --> 01:15:05,867
I've wasted time.

533
01:15:08,103 --> 01:15:10,571
And it ain't always
been my fault.

534
01:15:20,983 --> 01:15:25,720
But I'm gonna do what I need to,
and things gonna be better.

535
01:15:25,722 --> 01:15:27,722
I'm gonna be better.

536
01:15:32,794 --> 01:15:34,996
What you think about that?

537
01:15:59,321 --> 01:16:01,122
You want to hold it?

538
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:04,958
You can keep it till mornin'.

539
01:16:42,064 --> 01:16:43,664
You know,

540
01:16:45,701 --> 01:16:47,702
I got a little saved up.

541
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:52,206
After I take care of my brother,
we can go back north...

542
01:16:52,208 --> 01:16:54,008
and look for your father.

543
01:16:54,010 --> 01:16:55,776
<i>If</i> you want.

544
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:03,250
Hell, even if
we don't find him,

545
01:17:03,252 --> 01:17:05,453
you can travel with me
long as you want.

546
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:10,358
We can go out west.

547
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:14,328
Things supposed to be
different out there.

548
01:17:20,669 --> 01:17:23,804
Maybe I could do for you
what no one done for me.

549
01:17:26,842 --> 01:17:29,110
Ain't no point
goin' it alone, really.

550
01:17:32,047 --> 01:17:34,328
What you think about that?

551
01:17:37,686 --> 01:17:39,120
Huh?

552
01:17:43,225 --> 01:17:47,094
Well, you think about it.

553
01:22:34,416 --> 01:22:36,450
I was just thinking about you.

554
01:22:42,691 --> 01:22:44,658
Y'all get held up?

555
01:22:47,595 --> 01:22:49,663
Marcus ain't make it.

556
01:22:49,665 --> 01:22:51,398
Yeah, I heard.

557
01:22:56,538 --> 01:23:00,107
When we ride up,
he best be waitin' for me.

558
01:23:02,577 --> 01:23:05,446
But I know he will...

559
01:23:05,448 --> 01:23:07,648
'cause you're coming with us.

560
01:23:09,084 --> 01:23:11,251
He's here.

561
01:23:11,253 --> 01:23:14,655
I couldn't get his knife.

562
01:23:14,657 --> 01:23:16,724
Give me an hour.

563
01:23:16,726 --> 01:23:18,459
I'll get it.

564
01:23:46,521 --> 01:23:48,802
We should get movin' soon.

565
01:23:50,525 --> 01:23:52,459
Come on, now.

566
01:24:05,707 --> 01:24:08,075
Ain't no wind today.

567
01:24:09,811 --> 01:24:11,645
Should be warmer.

568
01:24:21,656 --> 01:24:23,590
Boy, what's wrong with you?

569
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:32,599
Huh?

570
01:24:35,370 --> 01:24:36,770
Speak up.

571
01:24:41,609 --> 01:24:43,210
Speak up.

572
01:24:44,612 --> 01:24:47,681
I want to get to my brother
before dark.

573
01:24:55,857 --> 01:24:58,358
Y-Your brother's dead.

574
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:06,767
We was supposed to bring you
for bounty hunters.

575
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:11,371
They were gonna kill you
for the money.

576
01:25:16,644 --> 01:25:19,580
They said they'd kill us
if we didn't bring you.

577
01:25:24,652 --> 01:25:27,012
You got to go far from here.

578
01:25:46,608 --> 01:25:48,709
You ain't deserve none of this.

579
01:26:16,437 --> 01:26:18,472
They're comin'!

580
01:26:18,474 --> 01:26:21,942
They're here! We got to run or fight.
We gotta go.

581
01:26:30,652 --> 01:26:32,286
Will?

582
01:26:35,256 --> 01:26:37,457
Come on out now.

583
01:26:41,496 --> 01:26:43,730
Let us do what we come for.

584
01:26:46,935 --> 01:26:49,803
Or else we can do you too.

585
01:26:49,805 --> 01:26:51,805
Nothin' gonna happen to you.

586
01:26:51,807 --> 01:26:54,127
- You gonna be all right.
- Other side!

587
01:26:57,213 --> 01:26:59,680
Go round back. Go on now!

588
01:27:00,949 --> 01:27:03,383
Give me your other knife.

589
01:27:03,851 --> 01:27:05,352
Will?

590
01:27:08,590 --> 01:27:10,457
This ain't your fault, son.

591
01:27:11,626 --> 01:27:14,361
You ain't like them.

592
01:27:14,363 --> 01:27:16,897
You risked your own skin
by tellin' me.

593
01:27:19,634 --> 01:27:21,435
I'm proud of you.

594
01:27:38,653 --> 01:27:40,687
Leave that there
so they see it.

595
01:27:40,689 --> 01:27:42,956
You go north now.

596
01:27:42,958 --> 01:27:45,892
Take Rachel to them people in
the swamp till this war's over.

597
01:27:45,894 --> 01:27:48,462
Then you go find your pa.

598
01:27:49,964 --> 01:27:51,965
I'll catch up with you.

599
01:27:51,967 --> 01:27:53,567
If I don't,

600
01:27:55,837 --> 01:27:57,871
you give half that to Rachel.

601
01:28:00,375 --> 01:28:03,043
- No!

602
01:28:03,045 --> 01:28:05,279
No!

603
01:28:05,281 --> 01:28:07,314
No!

604
01:28:11,019 --> 01:28:13,587
Nate!

605
01:28:40,348 --> 01:28:42,482
You done good.

606
01:28:42,484 --> 01:28:44,418
You done good.

607
01:28:51,826 --> 01:28:53,760
You're free to go.

608
01:28:56,597 --> 01:28:58,957
Don't follow us
if you want to live.
