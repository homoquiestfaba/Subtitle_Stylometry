00:11:39,426 --> 00:11:40,426
Go cry somewhere else,
will ya?

189
00:11:40,427 --> 00:11:41,861
I'm no geek, you knave.

190
00:11:41,862 --> 00:11:43,830
And I'm not shutting up
until I get The Book back.

191
00:11:43,831 --> 00:11:45,698
Have it your way, buzz-kill.

192
00:11:45,699 --> 00:11:47,767
(man)
Oh, check it out.
Fight, fight!

193
00:11:47,768 --> 00:11:48,801
(Ralph)
Come on!

194
00:11:48,802 --> 00:11:51,004
This is my house, man.

195
00:11:51,005 --> 00:11:53,406
Ow!

196
00:11:53,407 --> 00:11:55,408
Ya!

197
00:11:55,409 --> 00:11:57,143
Fucking creep.

198
00:11:57,144 --> 00:11:58,845
What?

199
00:12:03,751 --> 00:12:06,285
[sighs]

200
00:12:06,286 --> 00:12:08,454
Shit.

201
00:12:08,455 --> 00:12:09,722
Help!

202
00:12:09,723 --> 00:12:12,992
Police!

203
00:12:12,993 --> 00:12:15,028
Officers, I've been raped.

204
00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:16,062
(man)
You what?

205
00:12:16,063 --> 00:12:17,830
I've been raped.

206
00:12:17,831 --> 00:12:19,198
Geez.
Where'd it happen?

207
00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:21,568
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

208
00:12:21,569 --> 00:12:23,870
No, no, no, no, not raped
like sexually raped.

209
00:12:23,871 --> 00:12:25,304
Raped like the Earth
has been raped.

210
00:12:25,305 --> 00:12:27,406
My cool ideas,
they're in this book,

211
00:12:27,407 --> 00:12:29,042
a notebook.

212
00:12:29,043 --> 00:12:30,777
Kid, kid, kid--

213
00:12:30,778 --> 00:12:31,844
I live in a basement.

214
00:12:31,845 --> 00:12:34,180
So, what,
you were not raped?

215
00:12:34,181 --> 00:12:36,248
(Ralph)
Hey, hey!

216
00:12:36,249 --> 00:12:38,051
Sorry.
Yeah.

217
00:12:38,052 --> 00:12:39,986
Hail, Caesar.

218
00:12:39,987 --> 00:12:40,987
[laughs]

219
00:12:40,988 --> 00:12:42,088
Toga party, officer.

220
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:43,456
No shit.

221
00:12:44,592 --> 00:12:45,758
You been drinking tonight, son?

222
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:48,127
Absolutely not.
No, sir.

223
00:12:50,764 --> 00:12:51,998
Smoke a little weed?

224
00:12:51,999 --> 00:12:53,499
No.

225
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,068
So if I were
to pat you down,

226
00:12:55,069 --> 00:12:56,302
I wouldn't find
any weed on you?

227
00:12:56,303 --> 00:12:57,870
No, sir.

228
00:12:57,871 --> 00:13:00,907
Not even, like,
a small bud?

229
00:13:00,908 --> 00:13:02,441
Nope.

230
00:13:02,442 --> 00:13:03,776
A little roach
or something?

231
00:13:03,777 --> 00:13:06,746
No.

232
00:13:06,747 --> 00:13:08,547
Shit.
Damn.

233
00:13:08,548 --> 00:13:10,182
Hey, we found
your book, man.

234
00:13:10,183 --> 00:13:12,118
Oh.
Yeah.

235
00:13:12,119 --> 00:13:13,519
(Bickford)
Where? Who? How?

236
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,887
(Ralph)
Some dumb jerk brought it

237
00:13:14,888 --> 00:13:16,656
and read it on the toilet;
I don't know.

238
00:13:16,657 --> 00:13:18,925
Somebody found it there,
like, right after you left.

239
00:13:18,926 --> 00:13:20,259
The toilet?
Yeah.

240
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,728
That ignorant scum.

241
00:13:21,729 --> 00:13:23,863
(Ralph)
So thank you, officers.

242
00:13:23,864 --> 00:13:25,464
Seriously, really.
Please, thank you.

243
00:13:25,465 --> 00:13:27,700
But I think
we're okay now.

244
00:13:27,701 --> 00:13:29,135
You're all right,
yeah?

245
00:13:29,136 --> 00:13:30,937
Okay, get him home,
Brutus.

246
00:13:30,938 --> 00:13:35,008
Freaking college kids
with their frickin' books.

247
00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:38,945
It's Saturday night,
for Pete's sake.

248
00:13:38,946 --> 00:13:41,648
[laughs]

249
00:13:41,649 --> 00:13:43,716
Shit.

250
00:13:45,753 --> 00:13:50,890
Ralph, the shattered cosmos
once again align.

251
00:13:50,891 --> 00:13:52,659
You saved my life.

252
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,393
Thank you.

253
00:13:54,394 --> 00:13:55,561
Yeah, Bick, I--

254
00:13:55,562 --> 00:13:58,464
I lied, man.

255
00:13:58,465 --> 00:14:00,299
I mean, I didn't find
your book.

256
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,968
I just--

257
00:14:01,969 --> 00:14:03,369
What do you mean,
you lied?

258
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:06,673
You lied about the--
you lied lied?

259
00:14:06,674 --> 00:14:07,740
Yeah, Bick, I mean--

260
00:14:07,741 --> 00:14:09,008
You lied about
The Book, Ralph?

261
00:14:09,009 --> 00:14:10,109
You lied about The Book.

262
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,377
I had to, Bick.

263
00:14:11,378 --> 00:14:12,979
We can't have cops
around the house

264
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,213
with that rager.

265
00:14:14,214 --> 00:14:16,683
Everyone's drinking,
drunk, and I mean,

266
00:14:16,684 --> 00:14:17,784
God, even worse.

267
00:14:17,785 --> 00:14:21,620
I mean, seriously,
we could get fined.

268
00:14:21,621 --> 00:14:23,690
Oh.

269
00:14:23,691 --> 00:14:25,992
Are you okay?

270
00:14:25,993 --> 00:14:27,927
Oh, holy shit.

271
00:14:27,928 --> 00:14:30,496
(Dad)
It's not the end
of the worlds, Bick.

272
00:14:30,497 --> 00:14:31,964
Maybe it's a blessing
in disguise.

273
00:14:31,965 --> 00:14:34,834
Maybe this will get you
to stop thinking so much

274
00:14:34,835 --> 00:14:36,969
and get out there and do.

275
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,237
Out there? In there?

276
00:14:38,238 --> 00:14:40,173
It's all the same,
and nobody gets it.

277
00:14:40,174 --> 00:14:43,076
I mean, I talk, and I can
see it in their faces;

278
00:14:43,077 --> 00:14:45,244
people think I'm a lunatic.

279
00:14:45,245 --> 00:14:46,879
At least with The Book, I--

280
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,082
I've had enough
of the same conversation

281
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:52,284
over and over and over.

282
00:14:52,285 --> 00:14:54,253
I think I just need
to come home.

283
00:14:54,254 --> 00:14:55,722
I don't think I'm ready
for school.

284
00:14:55,723 --> 00:14:59,092
We all agreed--
you, me, the doctor--

285
00:14:59,093 --> 00:15:00,693
that school would be
the best next step.

286
00:15:00,694 --> 00:15:02,895
I know, but that decision
was based on a set of facts

287
00:15:02,896 --> 00:15:06,165
that have changed materially,
Dad, entirely.

288
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:09,202
I mean, I think I just need
to come home

289
00:15:09,203 --> 00:15:10,870
until The Book is finished,

290
00:15:10,871 --> 00:15:12,939
solve the thing,
start from scratch.

291
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,573
And I can't do that here,

292
00:15:14,574 --> 00:15:17,676
wallowing in this cesspool
of soon-to-be-Deltas

293
00:15:17,677 --> 00:15:19,078
of the brave new world.

294
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:24,683
Coming home
won't bring back Mom, Bickford.

295
00:15:24,684 --> 00:15:26,753
beep!

296
00:15:31,225 --> 00:15:33,659
"Every physical structure
in the universe,

297
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,562
"including ourselves,
is in a constant state of flux,

298
00:15:36,563 --> 00:15:40,599
"minimally and maximally,
continuously, continuously.

299
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,301
"Yet our lives are lived

300
00:15:42,302 --> 00:15:44,937
"in ever-flowing still frames
of reality,

301
00:15:44,938 --> 00:15:48,207
"sanity being the delusion
of a comfortable continuity

302
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:52,044
within the vortex
of infinite chaos."

303
00:15:52,045 --> 00:15:54,413
"Vortex
of infinite chaos"?

304
00:15:54,414 --> 00:15:56,682
Come on, you've got to admit,
that rules.

305
00:15:56,683 --> 00:15:58,785
I get it.

306
00:15:58,786 --> 00:16:00,486
Well, okay.

307
00:16:00,487 --> 00:16:01,654
Then he goes on to talk

308
00:16:01,655 --> 00:16:03,389
about how we're all
subatomically in flux

309
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,456
and emotionally in flux

310
00:16:04,457 --> 00:16:06,492
and consciously
and mentally in flux.

311
00:16:06,493 --> 00:16:08,761
I mean, even our flux
is in flux.

312
00:16:08,762 --> 00:16:10,196
So what?

313
00:16:10,197 --> 00:16:11,831
It's just that when you put

314
00:16:11,832 --> 00:16:13,833
all these ideas and theories
and facts together

315
00:16:13,834 --> 00:16:15,467
and think about them all
at the same time,

316
00:16:15,468 --> 00:16:18,971
interconnected,
your brain kind of orgasms.

317
00:16:18,972 --> 00:16:20,539
You must be stoned
off your head.

318
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,774
No, I am telling you.

319
00:16:21,775 --> 00:16:24,476
This book actually made me feel
these ideas--

320
00:16:24,477 --> 00:16:26,745
I mean, like, tingly in my toes.

321
00:16:26,746 --> 00:16:28,747
'Cause you were on a stoner
safari when you found it.

322
00:16:28,748 --> 00:16:30,482
Like the time you watched

323
00:16:30,483 --> 00:16:31,750
The Seventh Seal stoned

324
00:16:31,751 --> 00:16:33,085
and we didn't do anything
for the next month

325
00:16:33,086 --> 00:16:34,453
but stay in and watch
stupid Swedish movies.

326
00:16:34,454 --> 00:16:37,924
Ingmar Bergman isn't stupid.

327
00:16:37,925 --> 00:16:39,959
Ha!

328
00:16:41,094 --> 00:16:43,562
I should just go
sleep with this guy.

329
00:16:45,632 --> 00:16:48,801
"Copyright Bickford Shmeckler."

330
00:16:48,802 --> 00:16:50,803
What kind
of sick, twistoid parents

331
00:16:50,804 --> 00:16:53,172
would name their kid
Bickford Shmeckler?

332
00:16:53,173 --> 00:16:54,974
I'll ask him.

333
00:16:56,509 --> 00:16:58,077
Okay.

334
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:00,746
You win; I'll read it.

335
00:17:00,747 --> 00:17:03,149
Shit, I got to get to practice.

336
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:06,252
9:00 a.m. on a Sunday morning?

337
00:17:06,253 --> 00:17:08,487
That is so not rock and roll.

338
00:17:08,488 --> 00:17:10,556
Yeah, well,
we are not rock and roll.

339
00:17:10,557 --> 00:17:12,191
We're adult contemporary.

340
00:17:12,192 --> 00:17:14,593
There's a difference.

341
00:17:14,594 --> 00:17:17,396
So you really think
this book is that good

342
00:17:17,397 --> 00:17:19,398
that you would actually bang
the guy who wrote it?

343
00:17:19,399 --> 00:17:20,399
Yeah.

344
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,334
But I'm a nymphomaniac.

345
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,770
And a klepto.

346
00:17:24,771 --> 00:17:26,705
Hey, quit knocking my hobbies.

347
00:17:26,706 --> 00:17:28,640
You're their prime beneficiary.

348
00:17:28,641 --> 00:17:34,313
[Bickford screaming]

349
00:17:34,314 --> 00:17:37,750
Fucking Tarzan wanna-be
motherfucker.

350
00:17:37,751 --> 00:17:41,720
I hope he's not down there
slitting his wrists

351
00:17:41,721 --> 00:17:44,590
or hanging himself,
you know, OD'ing on pills,

352
00:17:44,591 --> 00:17:46,158
something horrible
like that.

353
00:17:46,159 --> 00:17:48,694
Dude, why are you so uptight
about Dickford?

354
00:17:48,695 --> 00:17:50,396
He doesn't even like us.

355
00:17:50,397 --> 00:17:52,331
Yeah, quit being
such a fag.

356
00:17:52,332 --> 00:17:53,432
[laughs]

357
00:17:53,433 --> 00:17:54,466
Pole smoker.

358
00:17:54,467 --> 00:17:55,768
Butt pirate.

359
00:17:55,769 --> 00:17:56,769
Fudge packer.

360
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:58,170
Ass bandit.

361
00:17:58,171 --> 00:17:59,438
Ha ha.

362
00:17:59,439 --> 00:18:01,407
Jiz guzzler.

363
00:18:01,408 --> 00:18:03,475
Yuck.

364
00:18:03,476 --> 00:18:04,476
Dude,
verbal violation.

365
00:18:04,477 --> 00:18:05,477
Dude, that was all net.

366
00:18:05,478 --> 00:18:06,979
All net, man.

367
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,680
(man)
No, you don't throw
"jiz" out like--

368
00:18:08,681 --> 00:18:09,681
Gentlemen.

369
00:18:09,682 --> 00:18:11,918
I found this
most telltale object

370
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,386
adjacent to the location

371
00:18:13,387 --> 00:18:15,721
my Tootsie Pops
formerly occupied.

372
00:18:15,722 --> 00:18:17,390
Huh?

373
00:18:17,391 --> 00:18:19,558
There was
an exceeding bodacious blonde

374
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:20,893
at the party last night.

375
00:18:20,894 --> 00:18:23,862
She had a wreath-type
flower thing in her hair.

376
00:18:23,863 --> 00:18:25,131
We conversed in the kitchen.

377
00:18:25,132 --> 00:18:28,167
I think she may be it,
the one, the culprit.

378
00:18:28,168 --> 00:18:29,868
That was Sara Witt.

379
00:18:29,869 --> 00:18:31,070
Sara Witt?

380
00:18:31,071 --> 00:18:32,671
She is pretty.

381
00:18:32,672 --> 00:18:34,941
Sara Witt
is a stone-cold fox, bro.

382
00:18:34,942 --> 00:18:36,175
Amen.

383
00:18:36,176 --> 00:18:38,877
And she's all
for free.

384
00:18:38,878 --> 00:18:39,878
All for free?

385
00:18:39,879 --> 00:18:40,947
Yeah, you know.

386
00:18:40,948 --> 00:18:41,981
Alpha Zeta Gi?

387
00:18:41,982 --> 00:18:43,416
It's a sorority.

388
00:18:44,717 --> 00:18:47,019
Down on Washington Street?

389
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,188
Alpha Zeta G.

390
00:18:49,189 --> 00:18:53,159
Washington Street.

391
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,228
(.38 Special)
¶ You see it all around you, ¶

392
00:18:56,229 --> 00:19:00,266
¶ good loving gone bad. ¶

393
00:19:00,267 --> 00:19:02,501
¶ And usually it's too late ¶

394
00:19:02,502 --> 00:19:07,873
¶ when you realize
what you had. ¶

395
00:19:07,874 --> 00:19:11,543

396
00:19:11,544 --> 00:19:15,381
¶ but don't let go. ¶

397
00:19:15,382 --> 00:19:18,985
¶ If you cling too tightly, ¶

00:19:18,986 --> 00:19:20,018

399
00:19:20,019 --> 00:19:21,620
I am ten times
more socially relevant

400
00:19:21,621 --> 00:19:23,923
than this geek.

401
00:19:56,055 --> 00:19:57,556
Sara Witt?

402
00:19:58,792 --> 00:20:00,325
Yeah, all right.

403
00:20:00,326 --> 00:20:02,828
I stopped by that sorority
house thing of yours,

404
00:20:02,829 --> 00:20:05,364
and your friends,
"sisters," droogies,

405
00:20:05,365 --> 00:20:07,432
whatever you call them,
told me I could find you here.

406
00:20:07,433 --> 00:20:12,705
Look, I want my book back
now, all right?

407
00:20:14,574 --> 00:20:17,743
You are the girl who stole
my book, are you not?

408
00:20:17,744 --> 00:20:21,614
You're Bickford Shmeckler,

409
00:20:21,615 --> 00:20:24,216
the man with
the metaphorical headache.

410
00:20:26,786 --> 00:20:29,889
And thank you so much.

411
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,289
Oh!

412
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:32,558
For what? For what?
God.

413
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:33,592
Inspiration.

414
00:20:33,593 --> 00:20:35,360
God, I read your words,

415
00:20:35,361 --> 00:20:37,530
and look what exploded
out of me.

416
00:20:37,531 --> 00:20:40,032
I think this is
my best work ever.

417
00:20:40,033 --> 00:20:43,301
What's the black spot
in the middle mean?

418
00:20:43,302 --> 00:20:45,203
That's my clitoris.

419
00:20:45,204 --> 00:20:46,438
It's a motif.

420
00:20:46,439 --> 00:20:48,574
I always put it somewhere
in each of my paintings.

421
00:20:50,043 --> 00:20:51,243
Do you like it?

422
00:20:51,244 --> 00:20:53,345
Your clitoris?

423
00:20:53,346 --> 00:20:56,582
No, the painting, silly.

424
00:20:56,583 --> 00:21:00,085
It's, uh...

425
00:21:00,086 --> 00:21:03,088
look, Sara, I want
my fucking book back,

426
00:21:03,089 --> 00:21:04,222
all right?

427
00:21:04,223 --> 00:21:05,323
I'm sorry.

428
00:21:05,324 --> 00:21:07,026
I'm just a little
too distracted right now

429
00:21:07,027 --> 00:21:09,428
to do superficial stuff
like look at art.

430
00:21:09,429 --> 00:21:12,330
Mm, well, distraction
is a vibration

431
00:21:12,331 --> 00:21:15,734
felt in the conscious mind,
sent by the subconscious,

432
00:21:15,735 --> 00:21:17,570
begging it
to pay attention.

433
00:21:17,571 --> 00:21:23,341
It is a whisper from
the mother of invention.

434
00:21:23,342 --> 00:21:25,210
That's--

435
00:21:25,211 --> 00:21:28,313
One of your cool ideas?

436
00:21:28,314 --> 00:21:33,752
It's very bizarre
to hear you say that.

437
00:21:38,058 --> 00:21:40,125
Trent.

438
00:21:40,126 --> 00:21:42,728
Meet my new friend,
Bickford.

439
00:21:42,729 --> 00:21:46,264
Craptastic.

440
00:21:46,265 --> 00:21:48,133
(Sara)
How could you throw it away

441
00:21:48,134 --> 00:21:49,935
after how much I told you
it meant to me?

442
00:21:49,936 --> 00:21:50,936
I thought it sucked.

443
00:21:50,937 --> 00:21:52,170
Oh, bullshit.

444
00:21:52,171 --> 00:21:53,438
You're just jealous.

445
00:21:53,439 --> 00:21:55,173
What did you expect
when you told me

446
00:21:55,174 --> 00:21:56,775
you'd fuck the guy
who wrote it?

447
00:21:56,776 --> 00:21:58,777
Fuck?
I didn't say it
like that.

448
00:21:58,778 --> 00:22:00,980
(Trent)
Yeah, you did,
as a matter of fact.

449
00:22:00,981 --> 00:22:02,848
"Ooh, ooh, his words
are so orgasmic.

450
00:22:02,849 --> 00:22:03,983
My toes
are just tingling."

451
00:22:03,984 --> 00:22:05,618
Excuse him;
he's an asshole.

452
00:22:05,619 --> 00:22:06,619
Hey, asshole man!

453
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,153
It's not here.

454
00:22:08,154 --> 00:22:09,655
You positive
this is the right can?

455
00:22:09,656 --> 00:22:11,289
Yeah, that's it.

456
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,290
Then where's The Book?

457
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:13,391
Hey,
I already apologized,

458
00:22:13,392 --> 00:22:14,960
like, a billion times.

459
00:22:14,961 --> 00:22:16,095
What do you want?

460
00:22:16,096 --> 00:22:17,429
Justice!
Come here.

461
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,430
Whoa, whoa, hey.

462
00:22:18,431 --> 00:22:19,498
Just--wait.
Hold on, man.

463
00:22:19,499 --> 00:22:21,967
Look, look, I got
200 bucks, okay?

464
00:22:21,968 --> 00:22:24,202
Oh, Trent,
don't go there.

465
00:22:24,203 --> 00:22:26,538
That's mine?

466
00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:27,606
Take it.

467
00:22:27,607 --> 00:22:29,174
Just, you know,
buy another notebook

468
00:22:29,175 --> 00:22:31,543
or diary or whatever
and rewrite it.

469
00:22:32,612 --> 00:22:34,046
Whoa, Bick.

470
00:22:34,047 --> 00:22:36,615
Bick, hey, just--
wait.

471
00:22:36,616 --> 00:22:38,651
Ooh!

472
00:22:42,321 --> 00:22:45,124
This isn't about money,
you smug, pretentious lemming.

473
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:46,925
[grunting]

474
00:22:46,926 --> 00:22:48,293
Come on, Bick.

475
00:22:48,294 --> 00:22:50,062
I didn't know he was going
to throw it away.

476
00:22:50,063 --> 00:22:51,697
It's not even really
my fault.

477
00:22:51,698 --> 00:22:52,765
Let me make it up to you.

478
00:22:52,766 --> 00:22:54,900
Make it up to me?
How?

479
00:22:54,901 --> 00:22:56,769
You've destroyed my life.

480
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:58,837
You can't make it up to me.

481
00:22:58,838 --> 00:23:01,339
The Book is gone.

482
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,474
It's gone!

483
00:23:02,475 --> 00:23:04,309
Gone!

484
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:08,981
(Autamata)
¶ I'm going back
where I come from. ¶

485
00:23:08,982 --> 00:23:13,418
¶ I'm going back
where I come from. ¶

486
00:23:13,419 --> 00:23:17,923
¶ I'm going back
to Jive County. ¶

487
00:23:17,924 --> 00:23:21,293
¶ I'm going back
to Jive County. ¶

488
00:23:21,294 --> 00:23:26,431
[phone ringing]

489
00:23:28,501 --> 00:23:29,668
Hello?

490
00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:31,036
(Bickford)
Ralph?

491
00:23:31,037 --> 00:23:32,971
Hey, Bick.

492
00:23:32,972 --> 00:23:35,307
Where are you?
Out partying?

493
00:23:35,308 --> 00:23:37,876
I'm in the basement.

494
00:23:37,877 --> 00:23:39,178
That's 30 feet away.

495
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:41,680
Why--why are you calling me?

496
00:23:41,681 --> 00:23:44,216
I just didn't feel
like the hike is all.

497
00:23:44,217 --> 00:23:46,819
I just want to express
my gratitude, Ralph.

498
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,887
Hmm? For what?

499
00:23:48,888 --> 00:23:51,023
I know you don't know me.

500
00:23:51,024 --> 00:23:52,758
I've only been here
a couple weeks.

501
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:55,627
But I--I appreciate
the honest attempt you've made

502
00:23:55,628 --> 00:23:56,929
to be kind to me.

503
00:23:59,132 --> 00:24:00,999
But...

504
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,168
I'm going away...

505
00:24:03,169 --> 00:24:05,170
for good.

506
00:24:05,171 --> 00:24:07,840
What do you mean,
"for good," Bick?

507
00:24:07,841 --> 00:24:10,743
I was almost finished,

508
00:24:10,744 --> 00:24:15,247
just looking for a way
to tie it all together.

509
00:24:15,248 --> 00:24:16,314
[sighs]

510
00:24:16,315 --> 00:24:17,349
A summation,

511
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:20,152
a final chapter, an end.

512
00:24:20,153 --> 00:24:23,288
But now I just--I feel

513
00:24:23,289 --> 00:24:25,724
like I'm trapped
in a Moebius strip.

514
00:24:25,725 --> 00:24:28,627
What's a Moebius strip, Bick?

515
00:24:28,628 --> 00:24:31,964
An infinite looping
figure eight, Ralph.

516
00:24:31,965 --> 00:24:34,133
Doomed to repeat
the same things

517
00:24:34,134 --> 00:24:38,603
over and over throughout time
indefinitely.

518
00:24:38,604 --> 00:24:42,674
It's cool, actually, if you--

519
00:24:42,675 --> 00:24:44,643
never mind.

520
00:24:44,644 --> 00:24:47,780
I'm going away, Ralph.

521
00:24:47,781 --> 00:24:50,415
I'm gone.

522
00:24:50,416 --> 00:24:52,484
So long, pal.

523
00:24:52,485 --> 00:24:54,119
Bick, hey--
[dial tone]

524
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,555
Bick. Bick.

525
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:20,712
[doorbell rings]

526
00:25:21,981 --> 00:25:23,515
[knocking]

527
00:25:23,516 --> 00:25:25,750
One second!

528
00:25:33,226 --> 00:25:35,827
Are you
Bickford Shmeckler?

529
00:25:35,828 --> 00:25:39,097
I'd like to speak
to Sheldon Shmeckler, please.

530
00:25:39,098 --> 00:25:40,765
(woman)
Who may I tell him
who's calling?

531
00:25:40,766 --> 00:25:42,100
His son.

532
00:25:42,101 --> 00:25:43,735
[knocking at door]

533
00:25:43,736 --> 00:25:47,472
(Ralph)
Hey, Bick, someone's here
to see you.

534
00:25:47,473 --> 00:25:49,974
He says he knows
about The Book.

535
00:25:49,975 --> 00:25:51,677
(Dad)
Hello, Bickford.

536
00:25:51,678 --> 00:25:52,711
Bickford?

537
00:25:52,712 --> 00:25:54,379
Bickford, hello?

538
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,414
(Ralph)
Come on, Bick.

539
00:25:55,415 --> 00:25:57,616
Uh...

540
00:25:57,617 --> 00:25:59,818
(Ralph)
His name's Spaceman.

541
00:25:59,819 --> 00:26:01,687
He's a homeless guy
who hangs out in the quad

542
00:26:01,688 --> 00:26:03,322
and begs for quarters.

543
00:26:03,323 --> 00:26:05,224
Everyone knows him.

544
00:26:05,225 --> 00:26:07,826
He's a great Frisbee player.

545
00:26:07,827 --> 00:26:09,561
Thank you.

546
00:26:09,562 --> 00:26:11,730
We're Frisbee
communicators.

547
00:26:11,731 --> 00:26:13,665
Right, and you have The Book?

548
00:26:13,666 --> 00:26:15,667
Just--

549
00:26:21,507 --> 00:26:24,476
What's this?

550
00:26:24,477 --> 00:26:26,911
You ripped out
the first page?

551
00:26:26,912 --> 00:26:28,813
Help us.

552
00:26:28,814 --> 00:26:31,082
Help us,
Bickford Shmeckler.

553
00:26:31,083 --> 00:26:33,685
Only you could understand

554
00:26:33,686 --> 00:26:36,121
an extradimensional ship
crashed

555
00:26:36,122 --> 00:26:37,556
into our temporal lobes,

556
00:26:37,557 --> 00:26:39,023
co-opting our sight,

557
00:26:39,024 --> 00:26:41,092
sound perception,

558
00:26:41,093 --> 00:26:43,895
our motor skills,
our most basic fundaments.

559
00:26:43,896 --> 00:26:46,064
They give us

560
00:26:46,065 --> 00:26:49,134
horrible, horrible migraines.

561
00:26:49,135 --> 00:26:51,870
He sounds a bit
like you.

562
00:26:51,871 --> 00:26:55,240
He's a severely delusional
schizophrenic, Ralph.

563
00:26:55,241 --> 00:26:57,108
He is?
How do you know that?

564
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,746
Listen,

565
00:27:00,747 --> 00:27:02,614
Spaceman.

566
00:27:02,615 --> 00:27:03,982
If you have my book,
I want it back.

567
00:27:03,983 --> 00:27:05,284
After.

568
00:27:05,285 --> 00:27:06,785
First.

569
00:27:09,455 --> 00:27:11,623
Listen.

570
00:27:11,624 --> 00:27:15,059
[radio static]

571
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,094
That's free digital

572
00:27:16,095 --> 00:27:17,929
acoustic waves.

573
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:20,265
Is that some funky shit
or what?

574
00:27:20,266 --> 00:27:23,468
I'm lost, man.

575
00:27:23,469 --> 00:27:24,803
(Spaceman)
Bickford Shmeckler,

576
00:27:24,804 --> 00:27:27,472
science and reason.

577
00:27:27,473 --> 00:27:28,707
You understand.

578
00:27:28,708 --> 00:27:35,314
To the stars
we'll go.

579
00:27:35,315 --> 00:27:37,048
They'll go.

580
00:27:37,049 --> 00:27:39,951
Home.

581
00:27:39,952 --> 00:27:42,521
I believe this deranged person
wants me

582
00:27:42,522 --> 00:27:44,055
to get aliens out
of his head.

583
00:27:44,056 --> 00:27:45,223
That's it!

584
00:27:45,224 --> 00:27:47,626
With your help,
I can expurgate

585
00:27:47,627 --> 00:27:49,093
these extradimensionals.

586
00:27:49,094 --> 00:27:50,329
Who?

587
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:52,564
The aliens in his head
are extradimensionals.

588
00:27:52,565 --> 00:27:54,766
Oh, no, no, okay.

589
00:27:54,767 --> 00:27:58,570
Spaceman, uh,

590
00:27:58,571 --> 00:28:00,905
just give me The Book back.

591
00:28:00,906 --> 00:28:02,507
Then I'll
help you.
No.

592
00:28:02,508 --> 00:28:04,643
Fine, no help,

593
00:28:04,644 --> 00:28:06,945
and you're going to give me
The Book back anyway.

594
00:28:06,946 --> 00:28:08,513
Help us,
or we'll burn it.

595
00:28:08,514 --> 00:28:09,948
You wouldn't dare.

596
00:28:09,949 --> 00:28:11,216
Try us.

597
00:28:11,217 --> 00:28:12,283
You wouldn't like us.

598
00:28:12,284 --> 00:28:13,452
I'll call the police.

599
00:28:13,453 --> 00:28:15,053
That won't save The Book.

600
00:28:17,289 --> 00:28:18,957
God!

601
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:20,925
I'd say
it's schizo's ball game.

602
00:28:22,962 --> 00:28:25,964
[faint rock music]

603
00:28:25,965 --> 00:28:33,505
¶ ¶

604
00:28:34,574 --> 00:28:35,774
Rob.
Wait, Rob.

605
00:28:35,775 --> 00:28:38,176
Let's--let's--
let's talk.

606
00:28:38,177 --> 00:28:40,479
Let's share some thoughts.

607
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,980
You mean, like, talk talk?

608
00:28:41,981 --> 00:28:43,047
Yeah, yeah.

609
00:28:43,048 --> 00:28:44,182
Blow my mind.

610
00:28:44,183 --> 00:28:45,216
Okay, cool.

611
00:28:45,217 --> 00:28:47,552
I can do that.

612
00:28:47,553 --> 00:28:51,022
Sara, you're so sexy.

613
00:28:51,023 --> 00:28:53,925
You're on.

614
00:28:53,926 --> 00:28:57,529
You're fuckably
fuckalicious.

615
00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:00,866
You got me hot as fuck.

616
00:29:00,867 --> 00:29:03,001
You like talking dirty,
don't you?

617
00:29:03,002 --> 00:29:04,436
Oh, sweet tits.

618
00:29:04,437 --> 00:29:06,772
No, no, no,
Rob, no.

619
00:29:06,773 --> 00:29:09,841
Talk, I mean,
like a conversation.

620
00:29:09,842 --> 00:29:12,377
I'll still be sexy later;
I promise.

621
00:29:12,378 --> 00:29:15,046
I thought you said
you and Trent broke up.

622
00:29:15,047 --> 00:29:16,882
Yeah.

623
00:29:16,883 --> 00:29:18,517
Yeah, I--

624
00:29:18,518 --> 00:29:21,620
Rob, I--this doesn't
feel right anymore.

625
00:29:21,621 --> 00:29:22,888
I can't do this.

626
00:29:22,889 --> 00:29:24,890
Sara, you're the one
who wanted to make out

627
00:29:24,891 --> 00:29:26,124
in the first place.

628
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:28,326
You seduced me.

629
00:29:28,327 --> 00:29:29,494
Yeah.

630
00:29:29,495 --> 00:29:31,963
Yeah, I guess I did.

631
00:29:31,964 --> 00:29:33,498
I just--

632
00:29:33,499 --> 00:29:36,000
I guess it's 'cause
you're kind of hunky,

633
00:29:36,001 --> 00:29:38,537
and I thought
this would be fun, but--

634
00:29:38,538 --> 00:29:40,939
But what?

635
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,607
You're not fun.

636
00:29:42,608 --> 00:29:45,276
I'm not fun?

637
00:29:45,277 --> 00:29:48,046
No, no,
not at all.

638
00:29:48,047 --> 00:29:49,080
What do you mean?

639
00:29:49,081 --> 00:29:52,016
Like, my technique?

640
00:29:52,017 --> 00:29:55,454
Yeah, that,
and also you're just--

641
00:29:55,455 --> 00:30:00,692
you make my skin crawl
just being you.

642
00:30:03,596 --> 00:30:06,364
That's devastating.

643
00:30:06,365 --> 00:30:07,566
Yeah.

644
00:30:07,567 --> 00:30:11,937
Well, sorry.

645
00:30:15,207 --> 00:30:16,641
(Bickford)
Spaceman, regardless

646
00:30:16,642 --> 00:30:19,611
of how I help you interpret
this random collection

647
00:30:19,612 --> 00:30:23,147
of scientific
gobbledygook--

648
00:30:23,148 --> 00:30:24,182
Gobbledygook.

649
00:30:24,183 --> 00:30:26,485
Yeah, regardless
of what we do--

650
00:30:26,486 --> 00:30:28,353
build a rocket ship,
a time machine,

651
00:30:28,354 --> 00:30:30,922
an atomic plasma-powered
slingshot--

652
00:30:30,923 --> 00:30:33,758
Good. That's good,
atomic plasma--

653
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:34,960
that's excellent.

654
00:30:34,961 --> 00:30:36,294
All right, whatever.

655
00:30:36,295 --> 00:30:37,662
Those aliens are never going
to leave your head,

656
00:30:37,663 --> 00:30:41,633
because you're sick
mentally.

657
00:30:41,634 --> 00:30:43,768
All right?

658
00:30:43,769 --> 00:30:44,970
You need medication.

659
00:30:44,971 --> 00:30:45,971
Do you mean drugs?

660
00:30:45,972 --> 00:30:49,841
Yes, powerful
psychiatric drugs.

661
00:30:49,842 --> 00:30:52,176
Have you ever tried them?

662
00:30:52,177 --> 00:30:54,746
Peridol, Zolam, lithium,

663
00:30:54,747 --> 00:30:56,581
LSD, peyote.

664
00:30:56,582 --> 00:30:57,716
Pretty girl.

665
00:30:57,717 --> 00:30:59,250
Pretty girl in a doily
right behind you.

666
00:31:02,087 --> 00:31:03,855
You.

667
00:31:03,856 --> 00:31:04,856
Bick.

668
00:31:04,857 --> 00:31:05,957
[clears throat]

669
00:31:05,958 --> 00:31:08,459
Contrary to what you
obviously believe,

670
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,828
I am not void of emotions.

671
00:31:09,829 --> 00:31:12,196
I've been feeling
like crap

672
00:31:12,197 --> 00:31:13,899
for days.

673
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:18,202
And Ralph told me
about The Book and Spaceman

674
00:31:18,203 --> 00:31:19,704
and this whole--

675
00:31:19,705 --> 00:31:20,772
Expedition.

676
00:31:20,773 --> 00:31:22,373
It's--this is
an expedition.

677
00:31:22,374 --> 00:31:24,609
Right.

678
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:28,613
So I just want you to know
that I--

679
00:31:28,614 --> 00:31:32,017
I can't express
how sorry I am,

680
00:31:32,018 --> 00:31:33,418
not with words.

681
00:31:35,721 --> 00:31:38,423
Draw us a diagram.

682
00:31:38,424 --> 00:31:39,758
[sighs]

683
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:41,392
I'm involved
in a Herculean struggle

684
00:31:41,393 --> 00:31:42,727
for sanity here, Sara.

685
00:31:42,728 --> 00:31:47,398
I don't have time to deal
with your pithy...pith.

686
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:52,103
Quit punishing yourself
for being a virgin.

687
00:31:52,104 --> 00:31:53,805
It's the human condition.

688
00:31:53,806 --> 00:31:54,839
We were all born virgins,

689
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,975
and maybe you're just
a late bloomer.

690
00:31:56,976 --> 00:31:58,476
I was too, you know.

691
00:31:58,477 --> 00:32:00,378
So that's my problem now,
lack of sex?

692
00:32:00,379 --> 00:32:01,412
That's it?
Great.

693
00:32:01,413 --> 00:32:03,014
Great.

694
00:32:03,015 --> 00:32:05,149
Thank you so much,
Dr. Klepto.

695
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,384
(Spaceman)
That's his problem,

696
00:32:06,385 --> 00:32:07,752
definitely, sex.

697
00:32:07,753 --> 00:32:09,253
Who asked you?

698
00:32:09,254 --> 00:32:11,489
(man)
Bob, you dickfor.

699
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:13,859
It took me 20 minutes
to set that dungeon.

700
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:16,728
You guys are not going
to believe this.

701
00:32:16,729 --> 00:32:17,796
You know Spaceman?

702
00:32:17,797 --> 00:32:19,531
Yeah, that dude who hangs out
in the dyad?

703
00:32:19,532 --> 00:32:20,565
Talks
to aliens.

704
00:32:20,566 --> 00:32:21,566
Plays Frisbee.

705
00:32:21,567 --> 00:32:22,934
Yes, him. Okay.

706
00:32:22,935 --> 00:32:25,103
He comes by the shack sometimes
when I'm working, okay?

707
00:32:25,104 --> 00:32:26,605
I give him, you know,
broken stuff

708
00:32:26,606 --> 00:32:28,339
like keyboards,
remote controls.

709
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,041
Anyway, he knows me,

710
00:32:30,042 --> 00:32:31,810
and he trusts me, right?

711
00:32:31,811 --> 00:32:33,445
(Doug)
Bob, we're mid-battle

712
00:32:33,446 --> 00:32:35,614
with a lich, two Medusa,

713
00:32:35,615 --> 00:32:36,848
and 40 skeleton warriors.

714
00:32:36,849 --> 00:32:38,082
31 skeletons.

715
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:40,285
My sorceress destroyed nine
with a fireball spell.

716
00:32:40,286 --> 00:32:41,319
Listen to me.

717
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,054
Yesterday Spaceman comes
into the shack

718
00:32:43,055 --> 00:32:44,088
with this book.

719
00:32:44,089 --> 00:32:45,223
He says he wants me
to hold on to it

720
00:32:45,224 --> 00:32:46,658
for safekeeping,
that people are after him.

721
00:32:46,659 --> 00:32:47,726
You know, he'll come back
for it.

722
00:32:47,727 --> 00:32:49,260
I ask him

723
00:32:49,261 --> 00:32:50,529
if it's his diary.

724
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:52,196
He says, no, he found it
in a garbage can,

725
00:32:52,197 --> 00:32:53,532
doesn't want to have it
on him

726
00:32:53,533 --> 00:32:55,467
in case Interpol comes
and shakes him down, right?

727
00:32:57,437 --> 00:33:03,608
I had to have a peek.

728
00:33:03,609 --> 00:33:05,510
It's unbelievable.

729
00:33:05,511 --> 00:33:07,612
It's brain-melting, poetic--

730
00:33:07,613 --> 00:33:11,082
it is the Communist Manifesto
of cool ideas.

731
00:33:11,083 --> 00:33:13,552
And, therefore, what?

732
00:33:13,553 --> 00:33:15,887
I'm quitting the game.

733
00:33:15,888 --> 00:33:17,221
(Doug)
Quitting?

734
00:33:17,222 --> 00:33:18,957
Why?

735
00:33:18,958 --> 00:33:19,958
For good?

736
00:33:19,959 --> 00:33:21,493
For the foreseeable future.

737
00:33:21,494 --> 00:33:23,829
You know,
after reading The Book,

738
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:26,230
Dungeons & Dragons
just seems

739
00:33:26,231 --> 00:33:28,366
like a bunch of people,
you know,

740
00:33:28,367 --> 00:33:30,435
taking on imaginary roles.

741
00:33:31,504 --> 00:33:32,904
That's what it is.

742
00:33:32,905 --> 00:33:34,072
(Bob)
Yeah.

743
00:33:34,073 --> 00:33:36,908
But The Book,
it makes life seem

744
00:33:36,909 --> 00:33:39,277
more interesting than D&D.

745
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:40,846
[people arguing]

746
00:33:40,847 --> 00:33:42,046
You can't quit.

747
00:33:42,047 --> 00:33:43,515
Without your elfin
rogue-illusionist,

748
00:33:43,516 --> 00:33:45,517
we're never going to make it
to the next level.

749
00:33:45,518 --> 00:33:48,353
You're--he's carrying the Wand
of the Crimson Magi.

750
00:33:48,354 --> 00:33:50,088
If you're out,
I'm stealing that wand.

751
00:33:50,089 --> 00:33:51,656
(woman)
You cannot grave rob.

752
00:33:51,657 --> 00:33:53,658
Yes, he can.
He's chaotic neutral.

753
00:33:53,659 --> 00:33:55,126
(Bob)
Read The Book, people.

754
00:33:55,127 --> 00:33:58,429
If you don't agree that it is
a veritable classic that,

755
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:00,465
but for the grace of God,
whose existence

756
00:34:00,466 --> 00:34:02,166
The Book debates
rather interestingly,

757
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:05,770
was saved from oblivion
by Spaceman picking garbage,

758
00:34:05,771 --> 00:34:07,939
I will--I will...

759
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:12,410
I'll buy you, each one of you,
a ticket

760
00:34:12,411 --> 00:34:14,846
for next week's
Buffy and Xena convention.

761
00:34:14,847 --> 00:34:16,581
I'm reading
The Book.

762
00:34:16,582 --> 00:34:17,983
Dibs on Buffy.

763
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,017
Xena.

764
00:34:19,018 --> 00:34:20,018
I'll get both of them.

765
00:34:20,019 --> 00:34:21,219
Let's do it.
You totally wish.

766
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,787
Just read The Book.

767
00:34:24,289 --> 00:34:28,860
(Bickford)
The Moon is 238,857 miles
from Earth.

768
00:34:28,861 --> 00:34:30,629
With the right lens,

769
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,964
it looks like you could
just reach out and touch it.

770
00:34:34,734 --> 00:34:35,934
What I want you to do

771
00:34:35,935 --> 00:34:38,570
is turn
that telescopic view

772
00:34:38,571 --> 00:34:40,839
inside your mind.

773
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,675
I want you to get a good beat
on those aliens.

774
00:34:43,676 --> 00:34:45,476
I want you to see them

775
00:34:45,477 --> 00:34:49,748
and that extradimensional
spaceship of theirs.

776
00:34:49,749 --> 00:34:52,450
I want--I want you
to reach in

777
00:34:52,451 --> 00:34:54,352
and flick them.

778
00:34:54,353 --> 00:34:55,921
You can't just flick
a spaceship.

779
00:34:55,922 --> 00:34:57,422
It's too heavy.

780
00:34:57,423 --> 00:34:59,323
And the trajection
wouldn't even be accurate.

781
00:34:59,324 --> 00:35:03,628
The theory of metalunar
clairvoyant projection is bunk.

782
00:35:05,631 --> 00:35:09,167
Spaceman, I have been
ueberpatient with you,

783
00:35:09,168 --> 00:35:10,334
all right?

784
00:35:10,335 --> 00:35:13,905
But I've had it.

785
00:35:13,906 --> 00:35:14,940
I've had it!

786
00:35:14,941 --> 00:35:17,508
Had it, had it, had it,
had it, all right?

787
00:35:17,509 --> 00:35:20,845
And I've come to a decision
that as far as I can see

788
00:35:20,846 --> 00:35:23,715
is the only cogent way out
of this predicament for me.

789
00:35:23,716 --> 00:35:24,950
I want my book
returned now,

790
00:35:24,951 --> 00:35:26,551
or I will kill you.

791
00:35:26,552 --> 00:35:27,752
Do you understand that?

792
00:35:27,753 --> 00:35:30,521
Even your strange brain
can surely access

793
00:35:30,522 --> 00:35:32,724
the instinct
of self-preservation, man.

794
00:35:32,725 --> 00:35:35,359
Use it.

795
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,829
If I give you your book back,
you'll abandon us,

796
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:40,131
like everyone else
has abandoned us.

797
00:35:40,132 --> 00:35:41,532
Fine! Fine!

798
00:35:41,533 --> 00:35:42,533
Fine, fine!

799
00:35:42,534 --> 00:35:43,802
All right, that's fine.

800
00:35:43,803 --> 00:35:45,203
That's okay.

801
00:35:45,204 --> 00:35:47,171
That's that, then.

802
00:35:47,172 --> 00:35:48,907
The next time you see me,

803
00:35:48,908 --> 00:35:51,309
I'll be stabbing you to death,
all right?

804
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:53,177
All of you.

805
00:35:55,781 --> 00:35:58,116
[over bullhorn]
Bickford Shmeckler,
we need your help.

806
00:35:58,117 --> 00:35:59,183
You have to help us!

807
00:35:59,184 --> 00:36:00,652
Please don't leave us, Bickford!

808
00:36:00,653 --> 00:36:02,553
(Bob)
Tired of thinking

809
00:36:02,554 --> 00:36:04,990
the same old shit?

810
00:36:04,991 --> 00:36:06,057
Read The Book.

811
00:36:06,058 --> 00:36:08,593
Are you looking
for a new adventure?

812
00:36:08,594 --> 00:36:09,894
Read The Book.

813
00:36:09,895 --> 00:36:12,764
Look your mind's eye
right in the face.

814
00:36:12,765 --> 00:36:13,965
Get inspired.

815
00:36:13,966 --> 00:36:15,500
It's free.

816
00:36:15,501 --> 00:36:17,636
Tired of the same old shit?

817
00:36:17,637 --> 00:36:18,970
Take a copy, comrade.

818
00:36:18,971 --> 00:36:21,072
The revolution begins
in your imagination.

819
00:36:21,073 --> 00:36:23,775
You don't say.

820
00:36:23,776 --> 00:36:25,376
I do.

821
00:36:25,377 --> 00:36:26,544
Get inspired.

822
00:36:26,545 --> 00:36:29,014
Are you looking
for a new adventure?

823
00:36:29,015 --> 00:36:31,516
Are you tired of thinking
the same old shit?

824
00:36:31,517 --> 00:36:34,853
Oh, take a copy, brother.

825
00:36:34,854 --> 00:36:37,155
Oh, you look a lost soul
who could use it.

826
00:36:37,156 --> 00:36:38,523
I'm busy. Move.

827
00:36:38,524 --> 00:36:40,091
Take a copy.
It's free.

828
00:36:40,092 --> 00:36:42,694
It tickles
the frontal lobe.

829
00:36:42,695 --> 00:36:43,695
Dude, dude.

830
00:36:43,696 --> 00:36:44,796
Damn it.

831
00:36:44,797 --> 00:36:45,830
Dude!

832
00:36:45,831 --> 00:36:46,898
The world doesn't need

833
00:36:46,899 --> 00:36:49,000
any more self-important
student poets.

834
00:36:49,001 --> 00:36:53,071
Ha ha, that's fucking--
cock.

835
00:36:53,072 --> 00:36:55,606
Ah, I don't know.

836
00:36:55,607 --> 00:36:56,708
You were strong.

837
00:36:56,709 --> 00:36:57,709
Yeah.

838
00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:00,178
Good one.
Good one.

839
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:03,548
Watch this special move.

840
00:37:03,549 --> 00:37:04,849
crash!

841
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:06,551
(Bickford)
What's that doing there, P.J.?

842
00:37:06,552 --> 00:37:09,821
Jesus Christ,
clean your shit up.

843
00:37:09,822 --> 00:37:13,692
[clattering]

844
00:37:17,697 --> 00:37:20,999
Where are
the butcher knives?

845
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,400
I don't think
we have any.

846
00:37:22,401 --> 00:37:23,968
[Bickford screams]

847
00:37:23,969 --> 00:37:26,104
There's some steak knives
in the drawer.

848
00:37:26,105 --> 00:37:28,606
Steak knives
are too small!

849
00:37:34,479 --> 00:37:35,914
[triumphantly]
Ha!

850
00:37:35,915 --> 00:37:37,215
This is perfect,
it's fearsome.

851
00:37:37,216 --> 00:37:38,216
Wait, wait, wait.

852
00:37:38,217 --> 00:37:40,685
Bick, you're not thinking of--

853
00:37:40,686 --> 00:37:42,253
what are you thinking?

854
00:37:42,254 --> 00:37:43,955
You wouldn't know it
to look at me, Ralph,

855
00:37:43,956 --> 00:37:46,324
but I'm a murderer,
a cold-blooded axman.

856
00:37:46,325 --> 00:37:48,159
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

857
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,828
If Spaceman doesn't
give me The Book back,

858
00:37:49,829 --> 00:37:50,829
I swear to God--

859
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:51,863
Okay, whoa, whoa, Bick!

860
00:37:51,864 --> 00:37:53,664
Bick, whoa!

861
00:37:53,665 --> 00:37:55,734
Slow, slow.

862
00:37:55,735 --> 00:37:58,069
Do the math,
all right?

863
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,070
Now--

864
00:37:59,071 --> 00:38:00,271
Ha!

865
00:38:00,272 --> 00:38:04,008
You threaten Spaceman
with that turkey fork, right?

866
00:38:04,009 --> 00:38:06,745
You ask him for The Book,
and he refuses.

867
00:38:06,746 --> 00:38:09,881
And he will refuse,
because he's deranged.

868
00:38:09,882 --> 00:38:11,182
What then?

869
00:38:11,183 --> 00:38:14,352
Then he gets
a free tracheotomy.

870
00:38:14,353 --> 00:38:15,419
And The Book?
What about The Book?

871
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,554
What about The Book?

872
00:38:16,555 --> 00:38:19,891
He's the only person
who knows where it is.

873
00:38:19,892 --> 00:38:22,060
You'll never find it again.

874
00:38:22,061 --> 00:38:24,428
And you'll go to jail.

875
00:38:25,831 --> 00:38:27,766
It's a credible threat,
Ralph.

876
00:38:27,767 --> 00:38:30,268
Mutual assured
destruction.

877
00:38:30,269 --> 00:38:32,003
If it helped to stop
a nuclear war

878
00:38:32,004 --> 00:38:33,204
with the Soviet Union,

879
00:38:33,205 --> 00:38:37,541
surely Spaceman's going
to understand that--

880
00:38:39,378 --> 00:38:42,046
Spaceman isn't going
to understand shit.

881
00:38:42,047 --> 00:38:44,983
No, he won't.

882
00:38:47,787 --> 00:38:50,922
Goddamn tyranny of logic.

883
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,464
[doorbell rings]

884
00:39:02,001 --> 00:39:03,467
Hello.
Hello.

885
00:39:03,468 --> 00:39:04,669
Hi.

886
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:07,138
I'm Trent Masterton
to see Sara Witt.

887
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:09,040
Hmm.
You're Trent.

888
00:39:09,041 --> 00:39:10,241
The poser boyfriend.

889
00:39:10,242 --> 00:39:12,343
She called me a poser?

890
00:39:12,344 --> 00:39:13,377
Among other things.

891
00:39:13,378 --> 00:39:14,679
Also a four-letter word
for...

892
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,614
[together]
Penis.

893
00:39:16,615 --> 00:39:17,916
Okay, all right.

894
00:39:17,917 --> 00:39:19,284
Is Sara in or not?

895
00:39:19,285 --> 00:39:20,952
[together]
Maybe.

896
00:39:20,953 --> 00:39:23,454
Okay, well, could you at least
make sure she gets this?

897
00:39:23,455 --> 00:39:24,455
Please?

898
00:39:24,456 --> 00:39:25,523
What's in it?

899
00:39:25,524 --> 00:39:26,858
None of your beeswax.

900
00:39:26,859 --> 00:39:28,226
Is it expensive?

901
00:39:28,227 --> 00:39:29,460
Looks good.
Let me see.

902
00:39:29,461 --> 00:39:32,430
Hey, can you give the box
to Sara, please?

903
00:39:32,431 --> 00:39:33,764
Sure.

904
00:39:33,765 --> 00:39:34,833
We'll get it
to her.

905
00:39:34,834 --> 00:39:36,667
Take care.
Bye-bye.

906
00:39:36,668 --> 00:39:38,602
Hey!

907
00:39:38,603 --> 00:39:41,639
She better get that gift!

908
00:39:59,925 --> 00:40:03,228
Did you know that the Sun
is going to implode

909
00:40:03,229 --> 00:40:05,997
and take out
the entire solar system

910
00:40:05,998 --> 00:40:07,698
and all of humanity with it?

911
00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:10,902
Ideas like that

or an incomplete form

920

and one needs some time
to get one's head together

922
00:40:50,442 --> 00:40:52,410

to stick his dad

924
00:40:54,914 --> 00:40:56,547
You mean you need
a medical leave?

925
00:40:56,548 --> 00:40:59,317
Maybe.

¶ I heard a voice,
and I had to stop. ¶

00:41:23,808 --> 00:41:26,477
¶ She called me
over that mountain top. ¶

I was going to freeze. ¶

Take it.
Put it in your cranium.

00:42:08,853 --> 00:42:12,390
Look your mind's eye
right in the face, huh?

944
00:42:12,391 --> 00:42:13,824
What does it mean?
Read The Book.

945
00:42:13,825 --> 00:42:17,595
Read The Book, buddy.
Read The Book.

946
00:42:17,596 --> 00:42:20,731
Come on, people.
Read it.

947
00:42:20,732 --> 00:42:22,933
Hey, read The Book!

948
00:42:22,934 --> 00:42:24,335

Call 911.

960
00:42:58,637 --> 00:43:00,838
Our senses work in spectrums,
all right?

961
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:02,373
Take sight, for example.

962
00:43:02,374 --> 00:43:06,844
Your eyes can only see energy
in the visible light spectrum.

963
00:43:06,845 --> 00:43:10,914
Those colors you can see are
only an infinitesimal fraction

964
00:43:10,915 --> 00:43:13,917
of the energy spectrums
that actually exist.

965
00:43:13,918 --> 00:43:17,154
It's the same with sound, taste,
smell, touch, everything.

966
00:43:17,155 --> 00:43:21,559
We exist in this narrow band
of perception.

967
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,926
All right?

968
00:43:22,927 --> 00:43:25,162
It makes something as simple
as just thinking clearly,

969
00:43:25,163 --> 00:43:28,031
frankly, impossible.

970
00:43:28,032 --> 00:43:31,101
That's why you're withdrawing
from school,

971
00:43:31,102 --> 00:43:37,775
because of this, what,
cosmic intruding stuff?

972
00:43:37,776 --> 00:43:42,179
Well, I mean, there are
other mitigating factors,

973
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:45,048
but those are harder
to explain.

974
00:43:45,049 --> 00:43:47,318

975
00:43:47,319 --> 00:43:50,120

00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:58,796
I think I know
why you're upset,

978
00:43:58,797 --> 00:44:01,532
and it's got nothing
to do with your book.

979
00:44:01,533 --> 00:44:03,501
All right.

980
00:44:03,502 --> 00:44:04,502
Enlighten me.

981
00:44:07,172 --> 00:44:09,607
I mean,

982
00:44:09,608 --> 00:44:14,044
I've had feelings
of loneliness too, you know,

983
00:44:14,045 --> 00:44:16,414
and anxiety

984
00:44:16,415 --> 00:44:20,984
or just hate.

985
00:44:20,985 --> 00:44:22,085
Hate?

986
00:44:22,086 --> 00:44:23,187
And I have to tell you.

987
00:44:23,188 --> 00:44:26,990
I feel safe in telling you,
okay, that--

988
00:44:26,991 --> 00:44:29,393
you look at yourself
in the mirror, okay?

989
00:44:29,394 --> 00:44:30,795
Really look closely.

990
00:44:30,796 --> 00:44:34,898
I bet--I bet
you see someone

991
00:44:34,899 --> 00:44:42,473
who looks a lot,
emotionally,

992
00:44:42,474 --> 00:44:43,474
like me.

993
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:47,845

995
00:44:54,653 --> 00:44:55,986
You're gay?

00:44:55,987 --> 00:44:58,356
Oh, yeah.

997
00:45:01,125 --> 00:45:02,460
Haven't you ever noticed

998
00:45:02,461 --> 00:45:05,796
that some guys just

999
00:45:05,797 --> 00:45:09,600
look really, really good?

1000
00:45:12,471 --> 00:45:15,205
You think that I'm...

1001
00:45:15,206 --> 00:45:16,940
like you?

1002
00:45:16,941 --> 00:45:18,342
Why not?

1003
00:45:18,343 --> 00:45:19,577
There's millions of us.

1004
00:45:19,578 --> 00:45:21,846
Come on.
No, there are millions.

1005
00:45:21,847 --> 00:45:24,014
We're not alone.

You're not going
to believe this,

1014

I've got to get that.

Oh.

00:45:59,551 --> 00:46:02,119
Uh, can we use your car

1020
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,522
to go pick Sara up
from the hospital?

1021

You should--

She totally
violated me, Ralph.

I could ever have in her,

although she does keep
kissing me,

1069
00:49:12,611 --> 00:49:14,077

pretty cool.

"Keeps"?
What do you mean, "keeps"?

Like, she kissed you like that,
like what I just saw, before?

1072
00:49:19,818 --> 00:49:21,985
Yes, once.

1073
00:49:21,986 --> 00:49:24,955
Only this time,
it was more lingering,

1074
00:49:24,956 --> 00:49:27,124
and she threw in
some tongue.

1075
00:49:27,125 --> 00:49:28,459
Pleasant surprise.

1076
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:29,894

perky, you know?

Excuse me.

1099
00:50:36,127 --> 00:50:37,828
May I have your attention,
please?

1100
00:50:37,829 --> 00:50:40,163
Uh, you got it.

1101
00:50:40,164 --> 00:50:41,932
Look, I'm Bickford Shmeckler.

1102
00:50:41,933 --> 00:50:43,601
I'm "Anonymous."

1103
00:50:43,602 --> 00:50:45,102
I know this guy.
I know this guy.

1104
00:50:45,103 --> 00:50:48,105
You're the--
you're the poet-hater guy

1105
00:50:48,106 --> 00:50:50,107
who hangs out in the quad
with Spaceman, right?

1106
00:50:50,108 --> 00:50:52,409
Poet-hater, no.
I'm a poet fan, believe you me.

1107
00:50:52,410 --> 00:50:54,778
And I'm the author of this book
you scofflaws

1108
00:50:54,779 --> 00:50:56,246

1109
00:50:56,247 --> 00:50:57,548
You wrote
The Book?

1110
00:50:57,549 --> 00:50:59,216
He wishes.

1111
00:50:59,217 --> 00:51:00,384
Yes, I wrote The Book.

1112
00:51:00,385 --> 00:51:01,652
I can prove it.

1113
00:51:01,653 --> 00:51:03,787
I believe the book
in your possession

1114
00:51:03,788 --> 00:51:05,088
is missing its first page.

1115
00:51:12,697 --> 00:51:14,197
Let me see that.

1116
00:51:18,737 --> 00:51:20,871
It's the same handwriting.

1117
00:51:23,842 --> 00:51:26,043
Whoa.

You're the guy.
You're the guy.

00:51:30,815 --> 00:51:32,983

you'd be more...

1123
00:51:33,985 --> 00:51:35,185
Yeah.

They're not, you know,
as cool as yours, but--

1127
00:51:41,159 --> 00:51:43,226
They're still fairly intensely
thought-provoking

1128
00:51:43,227 --> 00:51:46,030
and mildly pleasurable.

of the great book.

1133
00:51:53,672 --> 00:51:55,706

"we, the people" rap

with Ben Franklin.

I'm the one
with the cool ideas here,

1141
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,554
and you people are infringing
on my copyrights.

1142
00:52:10,555 --> 00:52:12,022
I want my book back now.

1143
00:52:12,023 --> 00:52:13,057
Plus, I insist

1144
00:52:13,058 --> 00:52:14,558
you dimwits cease and desist

1145
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:16,560
distributing my book
immediately.

1146
00:52:16,561 --> 00:52:18,729
Anything less, and I'll return
to your little shop here

1147
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:20,564

and a box of matches.

Yeah.

Hey, Slim,
hand me those mugs.

1172
00:53:04,575 --> 00:53:06,309
Gave it up for you,
but whatever.

Why don't you get out?

1174

Take it.
Take it and get out.

How about that?

1230
00:55:58,349 --> 00:56:01,285

and discovered

the anonymous young man
who wrote this remarkable book

1232
00:56:05,857 --> 00:56:09,026
was none other than one
of my very own students.

00:56:13,131 --> 00:56:14,264
Bickford.

1234
00:56:16,868 --> 00:56:20,370
I had no idea anyone
was paying attention--

1235
00:56:20,371 --> 00:56:23,941
not in an undergraduate
class, anyway,

1236
00:56:23,942 --> 00:56:26,609

so penetrating,

1237
00:56:26,610 --> 00:56:30,447

dare I say passionate?

1238
00:56:30,448 --> 00:56:31,882
Uh, Professor Adams.

1239
00:56:31,883 --> 00:56:36,019
Your class has nothing to do
with why I wrote The Book.

1240
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:39,389
I know all this
fundamental stuff already.

1241
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:40,858

I enjoyed your work
so much,

1245
00:56:49,467 --> 00:56:51,401
I took the liberty
of passing it on

1246
00:56:51,402 --> 00:56:54,137
to a publisher friend
of mine in New York.

1247
00:56:54,138 --> 00:56:56,406
What?
No, you didn't.

1248
00:56:56,407 --> 00:56:57,640
Yes, I did.
No.

00:56:57,641 --> 00:56:59,442
Yeah, he loves it,

1250
00:56:59,443 --> 00:57:00,978
and he wants to fly out here
to meet you.

1251
00:57:00,979 --> 00:57:02,212
I think he wants
to publish you.

1252
00:57:02,213 --> 00:57:03,513
And what exactly
does that mean?

1253
00:57:03,514 --> 00:57:07,484
Well, it means
that you owe me

1254

00:57:31,175 --> 00:57:32,175
Ooh, yeah.
Yeah?

1263
00:57:32,176 --> 00:57:33,242
Yeah?
Taste the juice?

1264
00:57:33,243 --> 00:57:34,510
Pineapple.
Citrusy.

1265
00:57:34,511 --> 00:57:35,979
That's it.

1266
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:37,847
Hey, Bick,
want to join the party?

1267
00:57:37,848 --> 00:57:39,348
Eh.

1268
00:57:39,349 --> 00:57:41,184
"Eh."

1269
00:57:41,185 --> 00:57:42,518
The genie's out
of the bottle.

1270
00:57:42,519 --> 00:57:44,721
The Book's out there,
way out there.

1271
00:57:44,722 --> 00:57:46,856
Everything is becoming
extremely tight,

1272
00:57:46,857 --> 00:57:48,091
closing in.

1273
00:57:48,092 --> 00:57:49,092
You know Professor Adams?

1274
00:57:49,093 --> 00:57:50,359
You're not going
to believe--

1275
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:51,461
Bick.

1276
00:57:51,462 --> 00:57:53,129
I'm all tapped out
of compassion.

1277
00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:55,465
You got
your book back, man.

1278
00:57:55,466 --> 00:57:57,734
Your nightmare,
it's over.

1279
00:57:57,735 --> 00:57:59,869
Move on, please.

1280
00:57:59,870 --> 00:58:03,206
But you, I thought,
were my friend.

1281
00:58:03,207 --> 00:58:04,540
Yeah, yeah,
and as your friend,

1282
00:58:04,541 --> 00:58:07,711
I'm telling you,
just be happy.

1283
00:58:07,712 --> 00:58:10,981
But happiness isn't just
a switch in your head

1284
00:58:10,982 --> 00:58:12,415
that you can flip on
at will.

1285
00:58:12,416 --> 00:58:16,052
Yes, it is.

1286
00:58:17,788 --> 00:58:19,288
Happiness is a switch?

1287
00:58:19,289 --> 00:58:21,290
That's so...

1288
00:58:21,291 --> 00:58:22,659
masturbatory.

1289
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:24,060
Well, isn't masturbation

1290
00:58:24,061 --> 00:58:26,796
one of the greatest inventions
of all time?

1291
00:58:26,797 --> 00:58:28,364
Ralph, come on.

1292
00:58:28,365 --> 00:58:29,432
I'm in crisis mode here.

1293
00:58:29,433 --> 00:58:30,967
All right.

1294
00:58:30,968 --> 00:58:32,836
What's masturbatory

1295
00:58:32,837 --> 00:58:37,240
is thinking all those
heavy thoughts all day long.

1296
00:58:37,241 --> 00:58:39,408
There is no need to be
so intense

1297
00:58:39,409 --> 00:58:41,344
about everything, Bick.

1298
00:58:41,345 --> 00:58:44,881
You're living your book
too much.

1299
00:58:44,882 --> 00:58:47,383
No, you just got
to flip that switch

1300
00:58:47,384 --> 00:58:51,655
and take some time
and just--just chill.

1301
00:58:51,656 --> 00:58:53,322
[sighs]

1302
00:58:53,323 --> 00:58:56,893
Believe me;
you need it, pal.

1303
00:58:59,130 --> 00:59:02,098
I'll catch you later.

1304
00:59:34,565 --> 00:59:37,067
[rapping]

1305
00:59:42,673 --> 00:59:44,741
You disappeared on us.

1306
00:59:46,577 --> 00:59:48,311
Yeah.

1307
00:59:48,312 --> 00:59:52,315
Yeah, I constantly
disappear and reappear.

1308
00:59:52,316 --> 00:59:53,850
It's a thing I do
subatomically.

1309
00:59:53,851 --> 00:59:55,418
Yeah.

1310
00:59:55,419 --> 00:59:57,821
It's happened several times
in this conversation already,

1311
00:59:57,822 --> 01:00:00,056
but it happened so fast,
you couldn't perceive it.

1312
01:00:04,261 --> 01:00:08,164
How are
the extradimensionals?

1313
01:00:08,165 --> 01:00:10,934
The extradimensionals
need you back.

1314
01:00:10,935 --> 01:00:14,270
They want us to rescue them
from the misery.

1315
01:00:16,373 --> 01:00:18,908
You can save us.

1316
01:00:20,711 --> 01:00:24,981
We need you
to solve the problem.

1317
01:00:45,169 --> 01:00:47,070
You never call.
You never write.

1318
01:00:47,071 --> 01:00:49,773
And then you just show up
out of the blue.

1319
01:00:49,774 --> 01:00:51,775
You really are cultivating

1320
01:00:51,776 --> 01:00:54,144
that whole mysterious guy
thing, aren't you?

1321
01:00:54,145 --> 01:00:57,546
I--I just need
to talk to someone.

1322
01:00:57,547 --> 01:01:00,884
[women giggling]

1323
01:01:11,495 --> 01:01:13,496
Okay, secret agent man.

1324
01:01:13,497 --> 01:01:15,098
What's the rumpus?

1325
01:01:15,099 --> 01:01:18,601
I, uh...

1326
01:01:18,602 --> 01:01:20,870
I think a publishing company
in New York

1327
01:01:20,871 --> 01:01:22,471
wants to buy The Book as-is.

1328
01:01:22,472 --> 01:01:24,040
Wait, wait, wait,
rewind.

1329
01:01:24,041 --> 01:01:26,475
Buy it?
You mean publish The Book?

1330
01:01:26,476 --> 01:01:28,311
Yeah, I don't know--

1331
01:01:28,312 --> 01:01:31,047
I don't know
all the details.

1332
01:01:31,048 --> 01:01:32,381
Some guy wants
to meet me.

1333
01:01:32,382 --> 01:01:33,616
He's flying out
from New York.

1334
01:01:33,617 --> 01:01:36,119
Bick, that is so cool!

1335
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:38,754
Yeah.

1336
01:01:38,755 --> 01:01:41,490
That is cool,
isn't it?

1337
01:01:45,262 --> 01:01:46,395
I'm sorry.

1338
01:01:46,396 --> 01:01:47,430
I need to go.

1339
01:01:47,431 --> 01:01:49,232
Bick, what is wrong?

1340
01:01:49,233 --> 01:01:52,802
Why did you even come here
in the first place?

1341
01:01:52,803 --> 01:01:57,106
I, uh...

1342
01:02:03,848 --> 01:02:05,348
Whatever it is,

1343
01:02:05,349 --> 01:02:07,116
it can't be that bad,
can it?

1344
01:02:07,117 --> 01:02:09,452
I killed my mom, Sara.

1345
01:02:09,453 --> 01:02:12,188
What, honey?

1346
01:02:12,189 --> 01:02:13,556
I can't sell The Book.

1347
01:02:13,557 --> 01:02:15,892
I only started it
because of my mom.

1348
01:02:15,893 --> 01:02:17,760
You killed her?

1349
01:02:17,761 --> 01:02:20,063
No. How?

1350
01:02:20,064 --> 01:02:21,397
With a butcher's knife?

1351
01:02:21,398 --> 01:02:23,233
A butcher's knife?

1352
01:02:23,234 --> 01:02:25,401
Ralph told me
about your episode

1353
01:02:25,402 --> 01:02:26,870
with the turkey fork,
and--

1354
01:02:26,871 --> 01:02:31,241
I killed my mom
with a car, Sara.

1355
01:02:31,242 --> 01:02:35,278
The car flipped
four times.

1356
01:02:35,279 --> 01:02:39,215
My mom died the next day
at the hospital,

1357
01:02:39,216 --> 01:02:41,684
the other driver instantly.

1358
01:02:41,685 --> 01:02:45,588
And...

1359
01:02:45,589 --> 01:02:47,556
I didn't suffer a scratch.

1360
01:02:47,557 --> 01:02:49,792
It sounds like that accident

1361
01:02:49,793 --> 01:02:52,561
wasn't even close
to being your fault.

1362
01:02:52,562 --> 01:02:56,399
That's what I told myself.

1363
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:00,203
I was stoic to the bone.

1364
01:03:00,204 --> 01:03:06,709
After a while,
I guess you could say

1365
01:03:06,710 --> 01:03:11,047
I got deluded.

1366
01:03:11,048 --> 01:03:14,650
I thought that people thought
I was speaking gibberish,

1367
01:03:14,651 --> 01:03:16,685
and when I heard them speak,

1368
01:03:16,686 --> 01:03:19,022
they just sounded
like shallow, petty idiots.

1369
01:03:19,023 --> 01:03:23,159
Well, that wasn't
your imagination, Bick.

1370
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:29,032
People can be
shallow, petty idiots.

1371
01:03:29,033 --> 01:03:33,569
It got so bad,
I couldn't leave my apartment.

1372
01:03:33,570 --> 01:03:39,542
My textbooks would talk
and sing to me.

1373
01:03:39,543 --> 01:03:43,746
And food
in the refrigerator

1374
01:03:43,747 --> 01:03:48,484
would become these,
like, wild cartoons.

1375
01:03:48,485 --> 01:03:50,286
Trip out.

1376
01:03:52,589 --> 01:03:55,325
And there was a knock
at the door.

1377
01:03:55,326 --> 01:03:58,461
It was my dad

1378
01:03:58,462 --> 01:04:04,600
and some doctor guy
from a mental institution

1379
01:04:04,601 --> 01:04:09,672
and a cop trained
in the handling

1380
01:04:09,673 --> 01:04:12,108
of psychotic individuals.

1381
01:04:12,109 --> 01:04:13,742
They forced you...

1382
01:04:13,743 --> 01:04:16,679
To a looney bin.

1383
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:17,746
Yeah.

1384
01:04:20,317 --> 01:04:24,487
And that, Sara,

1385
01:04:24,488 --> 01:04:28,024
I have never told anyone.

1386
01:04:28,025 --> 01:04:31,760
And they gave me
a notebook,

1387
01:04:31,761 --> 01:04:33,896
so I wrote.

1388
01:04:33,897 --> 01:04:35,298
And the more I wrote,

1389
01:04:35,299 --> 01:04:39,602
the more refined
my thoughts became.

1390
01:04:39,603 --> 01:04:41,371
[sighs]

1391
01:04:41,372 --> 01:04:44,673
Six weeks later,
they let me out.

1392
01:04:44,674 --> 01:04:48,077
And a month after that,
I showed up to school

1393
01:04:48,078 --> 01:04:53,782
relaxed, rested,
and ready for action.

1394
01:04:55,785 --> 01:04:57,786
And then you stole my book.

1395
01:05:00,157 --> 01:05:02,158
I'm so sorry.

1396
01:05:02,159 --> 01:05:05,995
I just--I loved it.

1397
01:05:05,996 --> 01:05:10,400
And I'm so glad
you got it back.

1398
01:05:16,573 --> 01:05:18,774
I'm going to end up
like Spaceman.

1399
01:05:18,775 --> 01:05:19,808
[laughs]

1400
01:05:19,809 --> 01:05:22,878
No, I am.

1401
01:05:22,879 --> 01:05:25,981
Like Spaceman, homeless
on some college campus,

1402
01:05:25,982 --> 01:05:28,384
collecting recyclables,
begging for quarters,

1403
01:05:28,385 --> 01:05:30,286
and trying to expurgate
extradimensionals

1404
01:05:30,287 --> 01:05:31,587
from my head.

1405
01:05:31,588 --> 01:05:33,556
No, you're not
mentally ill, Bick.

1406
01:05:33,557 --> 01:05:37,260
Not like that,
not even close.

1407
01:05:37,261 --> 01:05:39,128
You're just...

1408
01:05:39,129 --> 01:05:44,333
an anxious, self-absorbed
perfectionist,

1409
01:05:44,334 --> 01:05:47,236
all good qualities
under different circumstances.

1410
01:05:49,239 --> 01:05:52,275
You know what you need?

1411
01:05:54,644 --> 01:05:57,146
An end to The Book?

1412
01:05:57,147 --> 01:06:00,216
No.

1413
01:06:00,217 --> 01:06:04,153
A new beginning.

1414
01:06:24,108 --> 01:06:25,174
(man)
Da-da-da-dum.

1415
01:06:25,175 --> 01:06:26,876
This contract contains

1416
01:06:26,877 --> 01:06:29,144
the terms
we're willing to offer,

1417
01:06:29,145 --> 01:06:32,047
including a $20,000 advance
against royalties,

1418
01:06:32,048 --> 01:06:34,216
a 10,000-copy
first printing,

1419
01:06:34,217 --> 01:06:37,319
and a guarantee to market
the book accordingly.

1420
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:41,757
There's an awful lot
of fine print.

1421
01:06:41,758 --> 01:06:42,825
[laughs]

1422
01:06:42,826 --> 01:06:44,494
Well, that's because

1423
01:06:44,495 --> 01:06:46,061
we mean business.

1424
01:06:46,062 --> 01:06:52,535
Sir, the only reason
that I'm here is because--

1425
01:06:52,536 --> 01:06:54,804
well, there's this girl

1426
01:06:54,805 --> 01:06:57,006
who thought I would be a fool
not to meet you.

1427
01:06:57,007 --> 01:06:58,941
He has a girlfriend.

1428
01:06:58,942 --> 01:07:01,978
Yeah, he's informed me.

1429
01:07:01,979 --> 01:07:07,550
Well, I just want to say,
from the start,

1430
01:07:07,551 --> 01:07:08,684
The Book isn't finished.

1431
01:07:08,685 --> 01:07:10,452
Oh, of course.

1432
01:07:10,453 --> 01:07:12,187
No, it could use some editing.

1433
01:07:12,188 --> 01:07:14,857
But, Bickford,
I want you to understand

1434
01:07:14,858 --> 01:07:16,993
I don't expect you
to sign anything here and now.

1435
01:07:16,994 --> 01:07:19,294
Take the contract home.

1436
01:07:19,295 --> 01:07:21,497
Show it to your mom and dad,
a lawyer.

1437
01:07:21,498 --> 01:07:23,666
You could even have
a law student friend

1438
01:07:23,667 --> 01:07:25,234
review it pro bono.

1439
01:07:25,235 --> 01:07:27,269
[laughter]

1440
01:07:27,270 --> 01:07:28,905
Ah, I find
this collegiate atmosphere

1441
01:07:28,906 --> 01:07:30,072
very invigorating.

1442
01:07:32,609 --> 01:07:34,043
I also think,

1443
01:07:34,044 --> 01:07:35,978
if you'll forgive me
for being so forward--

1444
01:07:35,979 --> 01:07:38,514
but, hey, that's why I'm paid
the big bucks--

1445
01:07:38,515 --> 01:07:40,516
you may want
to give some thought

1446
01:07:40,517 --> 01:07:44,119
to finding a title
other than The Book

1447
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:45,187
for the book.

1448
01:07:45,188 --> 01:07:46,422
Yeah.

1449
01:07:46,423 --> 01:07:47,924
It's--well,
it's a tad pretentious.

1450
01:07:47,925 --> 01:07:49,792
And I fear
people may mistake it

1451
01:07:49,793 --> 01:07:51,226
for some kind
of religious text.

1452
01:07:51,227 --> 01:07:57,700
How about Bickford Shmeckler's
Cool Ideas?

1453
01:07:57,701 --> 01:08:00,002
'Cause you're Bickford,

1454
01:08:00,003 --> 01:08:03,305
and it's your cool ideas.

1455
01:08:03,306 --> 01:08:06,709
Bickford Shmeckler's
Cool Ideas.

1456
01:08:06,710 --> 01:08:08,310
I like it.

1457
01:08:28,665 --> 01:08:30,866
[dog barks]

1458
01:08:38,709 --> 01:08:40,743
(Sara)
You know, Bick,

1459
01:08:40,744 --> 01:08:42,578
if I'm reading this
correctly,

1460
01:08:42,579 --> 01:08:44,880
when the book goes
into second printing,

1461
01:08:44,881 --> 01:08:49,284
if it does, you could
make out like a bandit.

1462
01:08:49,285 --> 01:08:51,453
[groans]

1463
01:08:51,454 --> 01:08:54,724
I just can't stop thinking
this is a bad idea.

1464
01:08:54,725 --> 01:08:56,425
[sighs]

1465
01:08:58,762 --> 01:09:01,196
It'd be dedicated
to your mother.

1466
01:09:01,197 --> 01:09:04,867
Yeah, and she's really,
what, going to enjoy

1467
01:09:04,868 --> 01:09:07,069
spending
the royalty checks?

1468
01:09:07,070 --> 01:09:08,871
[sighs]

1469
01:09:08,872 --> 01:09:11,273
You know, Bick,

1470
01:09:11,274 --> 01:09:13,175
you should put
a warning label on your book.

1471
01:09:13,176 --> 01:09:14,443
"Author full of a shit

1472
01:09:14,444 --> 01:09:17,579
and doesn't understand
one word of what he wrote."

1473
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:18,814
Where are you going?

1474
01:09:18,815 --> 01:09:19,915
Oh, does it matter?

1475
01:09:19,916 --> 01:09:21,717
I'm not even
in this dimension, right?

1476
01:09:21,718 --> 01:09:23,919
Are you breaking up with me?

1477
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:25,287
[laughs]

1478
01:09:25,288 --> 01:09:27,723
After six days, it's not called
"breaking up," Bick.

1479
01:09:27,724 --> 01:09:31,661
It's called using your head
and steering clear.

1480
01:09:31,662 --> 01:09:33,663
You're dumping me
because I won't sell out

1481
01:09:33,664 --> 01:09:35,397
to the lemmings.

1482
01:09:35,398 --> 01:09:36,832
How could you,
of all people,

1483
01:09:36,833 --> 01:09:38,433
be that materialistic?

1484
01:09:38,434 --> 01:09:41,603
I couldn't care less
about the money, Bick.

1485
01:09:41,604 --> 01:09:42,938
You've written The Book.

1486
01:09:42,939 --> 01:09:44,040
It's finished.

1487
01:09:44,041 --> 01:09:45,641
It has been
since I met you.

1488
01:09:45,642 --> 01:09:47,043
So deal with it.

1489
01:09:52,348 --> 01:09:55,951
Misery may love company,
but I don't.

1490
01:09:55,952 --> 01:09:58,387
I like fun.

1491
01:10:07,297 --> 01:10:12,267
"Author full of shit."

1492
01:10:12,268 --> 01:10:14,737
"Author
full of shit."

1493
01:10:14,738 --> 01:10:16,105
"Warning.

1494
01:10:16,106 --> 01:10:17,573
Warning:
Author full of shit."

1495
01:10:17,574 --> 01:10:19,408
Huh?

1496
01:10:19,409 --> 01:10:21,610
Tell me, stranger,
do you doubt that you exist

1497
01:10:21,611 --> 01:10:23,445
standing there,
listening to my voice?

1498
01:10:23,446 --> 01:10:25,614
Uh, no?

1499
01:10:25,615 --> 01:10:26,782
Of course not.

1500
01:10:26,783 --> 01:10:27,917
Because, ultimately,

1501
01:10:27,918 --> 01:10:29,318
that horny little artist girl
is right.

1502
01:10:29,319 --> 01:10:30,720
I've been thinking
my brain fried

1503
01:10:30,721 --> 01:10:32,354
for two years,
and now where am I?

1504
01:10:32,355 --> 01:10:34,790
Nowhere.

1505
01:10:34,791 --> 01:10:37,359
You hear that, God?

1506
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:38,594
I've seen through
your secret plan.

1507
01:10:38,595 --> 01:10:39,661
No matter how smart,

1508
01:10:39,662 --> 01:10:41,463
how clever
we all think we are,

1509
01:10:41,464 --> 01:10:44,834
ultimately, we all know,
I know nothing.

1510
01:10:44,835 --> 01:10:46,301
Shit.

1511
01:10:46,302 --> 01:10:49,338
There is no theory
of everything.

1512
01:10:49,339 --> 01:10:50,505
We know nothing.

1513
01:10:50,506 --> 01:10:52,041
And anyone who thinks
they need to know

1514
01:10:52,042 --> 01:10:55,978
every single goddamn thing
is a...

1515
01:10:55,979 --> 01:10:57,679
dipshit.

1516
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:00,549
If I let that girl
walk out of my life--

1517
01:11:00,550 --> 01:11:01,650
You're the dipshit?

1518
01:11:01,651 --> 01:11:04,519
[laughter]

1519
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:06,188
I'm the dipshit.

1520
01:11:06,189 --> 01:11:12,461

It's, like,
the most important thing,

1537
01:12:07,450 --> 01:12:08,918
and I forgot that.

1538
01:12:08,919 --> 01:12:11,420
So you're just giving us
The Book?

1539
01:12:11,421 --> 01:12:12,621
On one condition:

1540
01:12:12,622 --> 01:12:15,057
that you keep
giving it away for free.

1541
01:12:15,058 --> 01:12:17,860
I don't want anybody
to profit off of it.

1542

That's not The Book.

1543
01:12:19,762 --> 01:12:21,730
Which means,
no merchandising.

1544
01:12:21,731 --> 01:12:22,764
Sorry, Bob.

I don't get it.

1551
01:12:31,041 --> 01:12:32,908
Why would you give us
The Book

1552
01:12:32,909 --> 01:12:35,277
when it is obviously
your life's work?

1553
01:12:35,278 --> 01:12:36,511
Yeah.

1554
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:46,355
All I can say is,
in the last couple weeks,

1555
01:12:46,356 --> 01:12:50,192
I had a life-changing,
quasipsychedelic epiphany.

1556
01:12:51,761 --> 01:12:53,929
And I got my fun back.

1557
01:12:53,930 --> 01:12:58,433
I had one of those, uh--

1558
01:12:58,434 --> 01:13:02,104
I had one of those epiphanies
reading The Book.

1559
01:13:02,105 --> 01:13:04,340
But if you had one
of those epiphanies

1560
01:13:04,341 --> 01:13:05,474
and you wrote the book--

1561
01:13:05,475 --> 01:13:07,776
Oh, oh,
that's a good one.

1562
01:13:07,777 --> 01:13:09,178
Oh, yeah.

01:13:09,179 --> 01:13:11,914

with them?

Brain-gasm.

1566
01:13:15,352 --> 01:13:17,719
(Doug)
That's the main reason
right there

1567
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:18,854
that The Reality Isn't Club

1568
01:13:18,855 --> 01:13:20,189
was ten times more popular

1569
01:13:20,190 --> 01:13:23,859
than Advanced Dungeons
& Dragons ever was.

1570
01:13:23,860 --> 01:13:26,328
This response
actually happens

1571
01:13:26,329 --> 01:13:27,963
when people read
The Book?

1572
01:13:27,964 --> 01:13:29,899
Ga!

1573
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:31,200
Ha!

1574
01:13:31,201 --> 01:13:32,167
Sometimes.

1575
01:13:33,370 --> 01:13:34,970
How utterly curious.

1576
01:13:34,971 --> 01:13:36,972
Just stop talking
one moment, please.

You didn't know

1578
01:13:38,108 --> 01:13:39,174
that happened?

1579
01:13:39,175 --> 01:13:40,809
(Bickford)
I had no idea.

1580
01:13:40,810 --> 01:13:43,512
I didn't intend for people
to ever read The Book.

1581
01:13:43,513 --> 01:13:46,715
But it escaped.

1582
01:13:46,716 --> 01:13:48,817
It had a will of its own,
I guess.

1583
01:13:48,818 --> 01:13:52,554
[people gasping]

1584
01:13:52,555 --> 01:13:53,956
Whoa.

1585
01:13:56,126 --> 01:14:01,397
So do we have a deal
or what?

1586
01:14:01,398 --> 01:14:03,966
You betcha.

I've painted a picture. ¶

¶ I've painted a picture
for the questioned wall. ¶

with the rest soon, ¶

¶ right up with the next few
that come along. ¶

1593
01:14:27,357 --> 01:14:28,557
¶ One more. ¶

1594
01:14:28,558 --> 01:14:32,561
¶ There's room for just more. ¶

1595
01:14:32,562 --> 01:14:35,498
¶ Once more, make room
for just one more. ¶

1596
01:14:35,499 --> 01:14:37,032
Dad, it's Bick.

1597
01:14:37,033 --> 01:14:38,066
I had sex.

1598
01:14:38,067 --> 01:14:39,502
(Dad)
You had sex.

1599
01:14:39,503 --> 01:14:42,838
Yeah, a bunch of times.

1600
01:14:42,839 --> 01:14:45,407
I never knew
what I was missing.

1601
01:14:45,408 --> 01:14:47,443
Hmm.

1602
01:14:47,444 --> 01:14:51,247
The human body
is the most marvelous thing.

1603
01:14:51,248 --> 01:14:54,216
Well, that's good news,
I guess.

1604
01:14:54,217 --> 01:14:58,320
And you're being--
what's the expression--safe?

1605
01:14:58,321 --> 01:14:59,855
Uh, yeah.

1606
01:14:59,856 --> 01:15:02,791
And everything else is okay.

1607
01:15:02,792 --> 01:15:05,227
Everything's awesome.
Fundamentally.

1608
01:15:05,228 --> 01:15:07,496
That's awesome
that it's awesome.

1609
01:15:07,497 --> 01:15:08,497
I gotta go.

1610
01:15:08,498 --> 01:15:10,899
Okay. Bye, Bick.

1611
01:15:24,314 --> 01:15:26,348
(Sara)
What are you writing?

1612
01:15:29,286 --> 01:15:31,320
An epic poem.

1613
01:15:31,321 --> 01:15:33,822
An epic sex poem.

1614
01:15:33,823 --> 01:15:35,224
About you.

1615
01:15:35,225 --> 01:15:37,326
It's kind of a sequel

1616
01:15:37,327 --> 01:15:38,360
to The Book.

1617
01:15:38,361 --> 01:15:39,795
Is it a porno?

1618
01:15:39,796 --> 01:15:41,664
[laughs]

1619
01:15:45,001 --> 01:15:46,835
Yes.

1620
01:15:46,836 --> 01:15:50,072
[laughs]

1621
01:15:50,073 --> 01:15:53,242
But it's going to be smart
and crazy subversive.

1622
01:15:53,243 --> 01:15:57,446
Ooh, I like
crazy subversive.

01:15:57,447 --> 01:16:00,749
(Simon & Garfunkel)
¶ Slow down.
You move too fast. ¶

1624
01:16:00,750 --> 01:16:03,686
¶ You got to make
the moment last. ¶

1625
01:16:03,687 --> 01:16:07,356
¶ Just kicking down
the cobblestones, ¶

1626
01:16:07,357 --> 01:16:12,894
¶ looking for fun
and feeling groovy. ¶

1627
01:16:12,895 --> 01:16:17,666
¶ Ba da-da da da da da,
feeling groovy. ¶

1628
01:16:17,667 --> 01:16:20,035
¶ ¶

1629
01:16:20,036 --> 01:16:21,503
¶ Hello, lamppost. ¶

1630
01:16:21,504 --> 01:16:22,971
¶ Whatcha knowing? ¶

1631
01:16:22,972 --> 01:16:26,174
¶ I've come to watch
your flowers growin'. ¶

1632
01:16:26,175 --> 01:16:29,712
¶ Ain't ya got
no rhymes for me? ¶

1633
01:16:29,713 --> 01:16:35,217
[electricity crackling]

1634
01:16:35,218 --> 01:16:38,220
¶ Ba da-da da da da da,
feeling groovy. ¶

1635
01:16:38,221 --> 01:16:40,822
Ah hoo!

1636
01:16:40,823 --> 01:16:44,727
¶ I got no deeds to do,
no promises to keep. ¶

1637
01:16:44,728 --> 01:16:47,162
¶ I'm dappled and drowsy
and ready to sleep. ¶

1638
01:16:47,163 --> 01:16:48,530
Bye!

1639
01:16:48,531 --> 01:16:51,233
¶ Let the morningtime drop
all its petals on me. ¶

1640
01:16:51,234 --> 01:16:52,767
¶ Life, I love you. ¶

1641
01:16:52,768 --> 01:16:55,971
¶ All is groovy. ¶

1642
01:16:55,972 --> 01:16:59,841
¶ Ba da da da da da da da.... ¶
