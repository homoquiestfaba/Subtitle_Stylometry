Listen.

Dreams make good stories,

happens when we're awake.

'Cause that's when
we make things happen.

177
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:39,668
if I'm not allowed
to face some actual risk?

178
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:41,003
You know why, Paul.

179

00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:45,674
And Grandfather
fought bulls for sport!

181
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,468
Yes.

182
00:13:47,551 --> 00:13:49,178
And look where that got him.

183
00:13:53,474 --> 00:13:55,851
I need you by my side.

184
00:13:55,934 --> 00:13:58,979
When we get to Arrakis,
we'll face enormous danger.

185
00:13:59,063 --> 00:14:00,606
What danger?

186
00:14:00,689 --> 00:14:02,566
The Fremen? The desert?

187
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,610
Political danger.

188
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:09,740
The Great Houses
look to us for leadership,

189
00:14:09,823 --> 00:14:11,867
and this threatens
the Emperor.

190
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:15,204
By taking Arrakis from the
Harkonnens and making it ours,

191
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:17,373
he sets the stage for a war

192
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:19,583
which would weaken
both houses.

193
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:22,878
But if we hold firm,

194
00:14:22,961 --> 00:14:25,047
and tap the true power
of Arrakis,

195
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,424
we could be stronger
than ever.

196
00:14:27,508 --> 00:14:29,134
What does that mean?

197
00:14:29,218 --> 00:14:30,344
Mining spice,

198
00:14:30,427 --> 00:14:31,929
keeping the Fremen
in their place?

199
00:14:32,012 --> 00:14:33,222
We'd be no better
than Harkonnens.

200
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:34,723
No.

201
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:37,935
By making an alliance
with the Fremen.

202
00:14:38,018 --> 00:14:40,729
That's what I've sent
Duncan Idaho to arrange.

203
00:14:42,189 --> 00:14:43,315
Here on Caladan,

204
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:45,901
we've ruled by air power
and sea power.

205
00:14:45,984 --> 00:14:49,822
On Arrakis, we need
to cultivate desert power.

206
00:14:53,075 --> 00:14:54,868
I want you sitting in
on my Council.

207
00:14:54,952 --> 00:14:56,328
Learn what I do.

208
00:14:56,412 --> 00:14:58,163
What if I'm not, Dad?

209
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,208
Not what?

210
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:05,254
The future of House Atreides.

211
00:15:07,715 --> 00:15:09,091
[Leto sighs]

212
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:20,060
I told my father
I didn't want this either.

213
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:25,858
I wanted to be a pilot.

214
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:28,485
You never told me that.

215
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,615
Your grandfather said,

216
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:36,452
"A great man
doesn't seek to lead.

217
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:40,164
He's called to it,
and he answers."

218
00:15:41,832 --> 00:15:43,751
And if your answer is no...

219
00:15:46,837 --> 00:15:50,048
you'll still be the only thing
I ever needed you to be...

220
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,135
my son.

221
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:07,232
I found my own way to it.
Maybe you'll find yours.

222
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:12,571
In their memory...

223
00:16:15,115 --> 00:16:16,909
give it a try.

224
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:25,626
[grunting]

225
00:16:25,709 --> 00:16:27,920
[Gurney] Don't stand
with your back to the door.

226
00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:30,672
How many times
do we have to tell you?

227
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:32,174
[Paul grunts]
I could tell it was you

228
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:34,009
by your footsteps,
Gurney Halleck.

229
00:16:34,092 --> 00:16:36,845
[Gurney] Someone
might imitate my stride.

230
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,180
[Paul] I know the difference.

231
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:39,848
Are you the new
Weapons Master?

232
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:43,685
With Duncan Idaho gone,
I must make do as best I can.

233
00:16:44,812 --> 00:16:46,188
Choose your blade.

234
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:48,023
I've had quite a day, Gurney.

235
00:16:48,106 --> 00:16:50,150
Give us a song instead.

236
00:16:54,738 --> 00:16:55,823
[smacks lips] That's rude.

237
00:16:57,115 --> 00:16:58,408
[Paul grunts]

238
00:17:00,828 --> 00:17:02,454

[Paul groans]

241

[panting]

242
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,883
[Gurney] Come on.

243
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:15,968
Come on.

244
00:17:16,051 --> 00:17:17,261
Old man.

245

Ah, the slow blade

[groans]

250
00:17:38,574 --> 00:17:40,409
I guess I'm not
in the mood today.

251
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:41,702
-Mood?
-Yeah.

252
00:17:41,785 --> 00:17:42,911
What's mood to do with it?

253
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:44,746
You fight
when the necessity arises,

255
00:17:45,914 --> 00:17:46,999
Now fight!

Aye.

260

But look down, my lord.

261
00:18:11,189 --> 00:18:13,775
You'd have joined me in death.

262
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,736
I see you found the mood.

[devices deactivate]

265
00:18:27,956 --> 00:18:29,541
Will it be that bad?

266
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:32,127
You don't get it, do you?

267
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,462
You don't really understand

268
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:36,215
the grave nature
of what's happening to us.

269
00:18:38,634 --> 00:18:40,135
For 80 years,

270
00:18:40,218 --> 00:18:42,346
Arrakis belonged
to House Harkonnen.

271
00:18:42,429 --> 00:18:44,932
80 years of owning
the spice fields.

272
00:18:45,015 --> 00:18:47,142
Can you imagine the wealth?

273
00:18:47,225 --> 00:18:49,144
Your eyes.
I need to see it in your eyes.

274
00:18:49,227 --> 00:18:51,730
You never met
Harkonnens before, I have.

275
00:18:51,813 --> 00:18:54,858
They're not human,
they're brutal!

276
00:18:54,942 --> 00:18:56,860
You have to be ready.

277
00:19:06,954 --> 00:19:09,081

[Vladimir] Rabban.

280
00:19:44,282 --> 00:19:46,952
The last of our ships
have left Arrakis.

281
00:19:47,828 --> 00:19:49,329
It's done.

282
00:19:49,413 --> 00:19:50,914
[Vladimir] Very good.

283
00:19:53,917 --> 00:19:56,003
Uncle, how can we
let this happen?

284
00:19:56,086 --> 00:19:58,130
How can the Emperor

285
00:19:58,213 --> 00:20:00,757
[shouting]
take everything we've built

286
00:20:00,841 --> 00:20:03,135
and give it to that Duke?

287
00:20:03,218 --> 00:20:04,511
How?

288
00:20:04,594 --> 00:20:07,514
Don't be too sure
it's an act of love.

When is a gift not a gift?

292
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:25,115
The Atreides' voice is rising,

293
00:20:25,198 --> 00:20:28,493
and the Emperor
is a jealous man.

294
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:33,749
A dangerous, jealous man.

The Reverend Mother
Gaius Helen Mohiam is here.

She was my teacher
at the Bene Gesserit school.

She wants to know
about your dreams.

How does she know
about my dreams?

311

And why is Dr. Yueh here?

312

He only needs a moment.

362
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:42,117
<i>Fear</i>

363
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,577
is the little death
that brings obliteration.

364
00:26:44,661 --> 00:26:47,288
-[whirring intensifies]
-[Paul grunts]

365
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:49,124
And I'll face my fear
and I'll permit it

366
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:50,333
to pass over me
and through me.

367
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:59,634
[ominous music playing]

[dramatic lamentation music

[searing]

370
00:27:05,723 --> 00:27:07,058
And when it has gone past...

371
00:27:15,733 --> 00:27:18,611
I will turn the inner eye
and see its path. [gasps]

372
00:27:21,656 --> 00:27:24,367
{\an8}[sobs] And where the fear
has gone,

373
00:27:25,201 --> 00:27:26,244
{\an8}there will be nothing.

374
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:32,750
Only I will remain.

375
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,298
Enough.

376
00:27:38,381 --> 00:27:40,592
-[panting]
-[whirring fading]

377
00:27:54,898 --> 00:27:57,525
Like sifting sand
through a screen,

378
00:27:57,609 --> 00:28:00,195
we sift people.

379
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:03,156
If you had been unable
to control your impulses,

380
00:28:03,239 --> 00:28:04,824
like an animal,

381
00:28:04,908 --> 00:28:07,118
we could not let you live.

382
00:28:07,202 --> 00:28:09,871
You inherit too much power.

383
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:11,080
What, because
I'm a duke's son?

384
00:28:11,164 --> 00:28:13,958
Because you are Jessica's son.

385
00:28:14,042 --> 00:28:16,669
You have more
than one birthright, boy.

386
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:19,339
Jessica?

387
00:28:26,387 --> 00:28:28,723
You've been training him
in the Way.

388
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:35,813
Tell me about these dreams.

389
00:28:35,897 --> 00:28:38,024
-I had one tonight.
-What did you see?

390
00:28:40,944 --> 00:28:42,320
A girl.

391
00:28:42,403 --> 00:28:44,072
On Arrakis.

392
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:45,532
Have you dreamt of her before?

393
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:50,954
Many times.

394
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:55,708
Do you often dream
things that happen

395
00:28:55,792 --> 00:28:56,960
just as you dreamed them?

396
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,673
Not exactly.

397
00:29:05,301 --> 00:29:06,928
Goodbye, young human.

398
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,347
I hope you live.

399
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:19,274
[Lady Jessica]
Did you have to go that far?

400
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:21,109
[Mohiam] You chose
to train him in the Way,

401
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:23,111
in defiance of our rule.

402
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:24,737
He wields our power.

403
00:29:24,821 --> 00:29:27,615
He had to be
tested to the limits.

404
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:30,952
So much potential,
wasted in a male.

405
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:32,996
You were told
to bear only daughters.

406
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:34,455
But you, in your pride,

407
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:36,457
thought you could
produce the<i> Kwisatz Haderach.</i>

408
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:37,959
Was I wrong?

409
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:40,795
You're lucky he didn't die
in that room.

410
00:29:40,878 --> 00:29:43,131
If he is The One,
he has a long way to go.

411
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:46,259
His Sight is barely awakened,
and now he goes into the fire.

412
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:50,179
But our plans
are measured in centuries.

413
00:29:50,263 --> 00:29:51,806
We have other prospects

414
00:29:51,889 --> 00:29:54,267
if he fails his promise.

415
00:29:56,853 --> 00:29:59,355
Do you see so little hope?

416
00:29:59,439 --> 00:30:00,815
[Mohiam] On Arrakis,
we have done

417
00:30:00,898 --> 00:30:02,525
all we can for you.

418
00:30:02,609 --> 00:30:04,444
A path has been laid.

419
00:30:04,527 --> 00:30:06,779
Let's hope
he doesn't squander it.

420
00:30:13,661 --> 00:30:15,788

[Lady Jessica] Paul.

423
00:30:56,245 --> 00:30:57,830
[Paul] What does it mean?

424
00:30:59,207 --> 00:31:00,875
That I could be The One?

425
00:31:00,958 --> 00:31:02,293
[Lady Jessica] You heard.

426
00:31:05,672 --> 00:31:06,923
The Bene Gesserit serve

427
00:31:07,006 --> 00:31:09,509
as powerful partners
to the Great Houses,

428
00:31:10,551 --> 00:31:11,803
but there's more to it.

429
00:31:11,886 --> 00:31:14,430
You steer the politics
of the Imperium

430
00:31:14,514 --> 00:31:15,932
from the shadows.

431
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:17,642
I know.

432
00:31:17,725 --> 00:31:20,186
You don't know everything.

433
00:31:20,269 --> 00:31:22,563
For thousands of years,

434
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:25,274
we've been carefully
crossings bloodlines

435
00:31:25,358 --> 00:31:27,485
-to bring forth...
-The One?

436
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:30,113
A mind...

437
00:31:31,864 --> 00:31:36,202
powerful enough
to bridge space and time.

438
00:31:36,994 --> 00:31:38,830
Past and future.

439
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:43,126
Who can help us
into a better future.

440
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:47,004
We think he's very close now.

441
00:31:48,965 --> 00:31:51,134
Some believe he's here.

442
00:31:55,138 --> 00:31:57,140
All part of a plan.

00:35:54,543 --> 00:35:56,837
How does it feel
to walk on a new world?

457
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:58,839
Exciting, to say the least.

My lord.

459
00:36:01,467 --> 00:36:03,094
How are you, old friend?

My advance team
has secured the city.

We're still smoothing out
a few rough spots.

<i>Lisan al-Gaib.</i>
"Voice from the Outer World."

486
00:37:50,326 --> 00:37:53,037
It's their name for "messiah."

487
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,415
It means the Bene Gesserit
have been at work here.

488
00:37:56,499 --> 00:37:58,959
Planting superstitions.

489
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:01,837
Preparing the way, Paul.

they see the signs.

They see

[Gurney] The locals call

[Leto] Well, the Hand of God
is wreaking havoc

503
00:40:09,089 --> 00:40:10,549
It's so quiet.

00:40:11,592 --> 00:40:13,636
[Gurney] Yeah.

505
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:15,596
That's what worries me, too.

506
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:24,104
[Leto] There's the spaceport

507
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:26,815
and that plume of dust there
is the spice refinery.

508
00:40:26,899 --> 00:40:28,984
Our two
most vulnerable points.

509
00:40:29,068 --> 00:40:30,361
I want you guarding them.

-we're dead here.

[Leto sighs]

514
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:44,792
What do they say
about this hellhole again?

515
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:47,336
"To shower, you scrub your ass
with sand," my lord.

516
00:40:47,419 --> 00:40:48,963
That's what they say.

That's what they say.

Shadout.

524
00:41:26,834 --> 00:41:28,627
It's an old Chakobsa word.

525

I must warn you,

it won't be enough.

00:52:09,142 --> 00:52:10,602
You were right.

695
00:52:10,685 --> 00:52:14,022
The Harkonnen estimate was
50,000 on the whole planet.

696
00:52:14,105 --> 00:52:16,316
The Fremen watched me
search for them for days.

I never saw them.

698
00:52:17,943 --> 00:52:20,654

a warrior out to kill me.

716
00:53:17,794 --> 00:53:19,587
of any man that respects mine.

717
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:22,799
[inhales deeply]

718
00:53:22,882 --> 00:53:23,925
[Stilgar] Hmm.

719
00:53:25,343 --> 00:53:26,803
[inhales deeply]

720
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:28,680
[Duncan] Hold.

721
00:53:29,931 --> 00:53:31,850
[clears throat]
Thank you, Stilgar,

722
00:53:31,933 --> 00:53:35,353
for the gift
of your body's moisture.

723
00:53:35,437 --> 00:53:37,772
We accept it in the spirit
in which it was given.

724
00:53:43,445 --> 00:53:44,612
[Leto snorts]

725
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:46,865
[Leto] I'm glad you've come.

726
00:53:47,824 --> 00:53:49,743
I believe your people and mine

727
00:53:49,826 --> 00:53:51,119
have much
to offer one another.

728
00:53:51,202 --> 00:53:52,579
No, no, you are Outworlders.

729
00:53:52,662 --> 00:53:54,330
You come here for the spice,

730
00:53:54,414 --> 00:53:56,875
you take it,
giving nothing in return.

731
00:53:58,626 --> 00:53:59,669
That's true.

732
00:54:01,588 --> 00:54:04,507
I know you've suffered
at the hands of the Harkonnen.

733
00:54:05,675 --> 00:54:07,135
Name what you want.

734
00:54:07,218 --> 00:54:08,428
If it's in my power to grant,

735
00:54:08,511 --> 00:54:09,971
I'll give it
and ask for nothing.

736
00:54:10,055 --> 00:54:12,932
Mm. I ask for this.
Do not seek our<i> sietches.</i>

737
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:15,852
Do not trespass in our lands.

738
00:54:15,935 --> 00:54:19,397
The desert was ours
long before you came.

739
00:54:19,481 --> 00:54:21,274
So, come and dig your spice,

740
00:54:21,357 --> 00:54:22,567
but when you have it,

741
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:24,778
go back to this side
of the Shield Wall

742
00:54:24,861 --> 00:54:26,654
and leave the desert
to the Fremen.

743
00:54:26,738 --> 00:54:29,532
You will address the Duke
as "my lord" or "sire."

744
00:54:29,616 --> 00:54:32,202
[Leto] Gurney, just...
Just a moment.

745
00:54:32,285 --> 00:54:33,620
The Emperor

746
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:36,456
has given me Arrakis
as my fief

747
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:38,291
to rule and protect.

748
00:54:38,374 --> 00:54:40,877
I cannot promise
not to travel into the desert

749
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,797
if duty compels me.

750
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,800
But your<i> sietches</i>
will be yours forever.

751
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:49,469
And you will never be hunted
while I govern here.

752
00:54:53,973 --> 00:54:55,809
That's very honorable.

753
00:54:55,892 --> 00:54:58,561
I must go. That's all
I have to say to you.

754
00:54:58,645 --> 00:55:00,814
[Paul] Won't you stay?

755
00:55:00,897 --> 00:55:02,273
We would honor you.

756
00:55:02,357 --> 00:55:05,443
Honor requires
that I be elsewhere.

757
00:55:07,403 --> 00:55:08,655
{\an8}[speaking Chakobsa]

758
00:55:17,122 --> 00:55:18,373
I don't like him.

759
00:55:18,456 --> 00:55:20,708
Our plan bears fruit.

760
00:55:20,792 --> 00:55:22,210
But it will take time?

761
00:55:22,293 --> 00:55:23,545
Yes.

762
00:55:24,504 --> 00:55:26,798
It will take time.

763
00:55:29,551 --> 00:55:30,927
Here, this is for you.

764
00:55:35,014 --> 00:55:37,016
It's a paracompass.

765
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:39,602
The moons here
have a magnetic field, so...

766
00:55:39,686 --> 00:55:42,313
a simple compass needle
won't point north.

767
00:55:42,397 --> 00:55:44,524
Takes a clever piece
of clockwork to sort it out.

768
00:55:44,607 --> 00:55:46,276
[Paul] The Fremen make these?

769
00:55:46,359 --> 00:55:48,194
And stillsuits,
and sand compactors,

770
00:55:48,278 --> 00:55:49,696
and all kinds
of ingenious things.

771
00:55:49,779 --> 00:55:51,739
[Gurney] What the hell
is a sand compactor?

772
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:55,034
[Duncan]
That's a sand compactor.

774
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:59,038
My God, man,
you've gone native.

775
00:55:59,122 --> 00:56:00,415
You admire them.

776
00:56:01,708 --> 00:56:03,209
I do.

777
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:05,962
They're fierce but loyal.

778
00:56:06,045 --> 00:56:07,839
They're attuned to the desert.

779
00:56:07,922 --> 00:56:09,174
Part of it.

780
00:56:09,257 --> 00:56:11,384
It's part of them.

781
00:56:11,467 --> 00:56:12,635
You wait till you see it.

782
00:56:13,469 --> 00:56:14,888

My lord Duke.

Welcome to Arrakis.

794
00:57:12,362 --> 00:57:14,447
[Paul] You're
the Imperial Ecologist.

795
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:16,449
Thank you for the stillsuits.

796
00:57:16,532 --> 00:57:18,618
They are of Fremen make.

797
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:19,786

With your permission, sire,

799
00:57:21,246 --> 00:57:22,622
I must check
the integrity of your suit...

800
00:57:22,705 --> 00:57:23,831
[Leto] Whoa.

801
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:25,750
It's all right.

802
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:29,587
It's all right.

803
00:57:29,671 --> 00:57:33,258
[chuckles lightly] Dr. Kynes,
we're in your hands.

804
00:57:37,804 --> 00:57:38,972
A stillsuit

805
00:57:39,055 --> 00:57:43,017
is a high-efficiency
filtration system.

806
00:57:43,101 --> 00:57:44,686
Even this early
in the morning,

807
00:57:44,769 --> 00:57:47,563
you wouldn't survive two hours
without one of these.

808
00:57:48,481 --> 00:57:50,733
It cools the body

809
00:57:50,817 --> 00:57:54,654
and recycles
the water lost to sweat.

810
00:57:54,737 --> 00:57:58,032
Your body's movements
provide the power.

811
00:57:58,116 --> 00:57:59,826
Inside the mask,
you'll find a tube

812
00:57:59,909 --> 00:58:01,995
to allow you to drink
the recycled water.

813
00:58:02,078 --> 00:58:03,329
[Leto] Mm.

814
00:58:03,413 --> 00:58:04,747
In good working order,
your suit won't lose

815
00:58:04,831 --> 00:58:07,125
more than a thimbleful
of water a day.

816
00:58:07,208 --> 00:58:08,543
[Leto] Most impressive.

00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:11,587
Let's have a look at you, lad.

818
00:58:13,923 --> 00:58:15,341
You've...

819
00:58:15,425 --> 00:58:16,634
worn a stillsuit before?

820
00:58:16,718 --> 00:58:18,344
No, this is my first time.

821
00:58:20,555 --> 00:58:23,182
Your desert boots are fitted
slip-fashion at the ankles.

822
00:58:23,266 --> 00:58:25,101
Who taught you to do that?

823
00:58:25,184 --> 00:58:27,228
It seemed the right way.

Now, come and see

your livelihood depends.

00:59:25,536 --> 00:59:26,746
What would you do

831
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:28,373
if your ornithopter
went down out here?

832
00:59:28,456 --> 00:59:30,583
You wouldn't want
to go down out there.

833
00:59:30,666 --> 00:59:32,251
It's worm territory.

834

Dust cloud.

835
00:59:37,048 --> 00:59:39,258
[Leto] I see it.

836
00:59:39,342 --> 00:59:41,469
That's one of your harvesters.

You can see the spice

If you get a little higher,
you'll have a better view.

849

If you are patient,

850
01:00:48,077 --> 01:00:50,163
we should see one.

851
01:00:50,246 --> 01:00:51,706
A worm always comes?

852
01:00:51,789 --> 01:00:54,584
Always. They're drawn
by rhythmic noises.

853
01:00:54,667 --> 01:00:56,752
Why don't we just shield
the crawlers?

854
01:00:56,836 --> 01:00:59,338
A shield's a death sentence
in the desert.

855
01:00:59,422 --> 01:01:00,673
It attracts the worms

856
01:01:00,756 --> 01:01:03,426

into a killing frenzy.

I'm sorry, my lord.

I had no choice.

1092
01:22:35,884 --> 01:22:39,721
The Harkonnens
have my wife, Wanna.

1093
01:22:39,804 --> 01:22:42,348
They take her apart
like a doll.

1094
01:22:43,349 --> 01:22:45,477
I will buy her freedom.

1095
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:47,145

I will do what I can.

I'm going to replace
your peg tooth.

If you bite down hard,

Breathe out, and you will
fill the air with poison.

Everyone's shouting my name!

1253
01:40:43,846 --> 01:40:44,847
Paul.

1254
01:40:48,517 --> 01:40:50,602
Paul Atreides.

1255
01:40:50,686 --> 01:40:53,647
You are your father's son.
You are my son.

1256
01:40:53,730 --> 01:40:57,234
You are
the Duke Paul Atreides.

1257
01:40:57,317 --> 01:41:00,112
You know who you are.
You know who you are.

1258

1268

You need to drink.

1269
01:42:17,147 --> 01:42:19,441
It's recycled water
from the tent.

1270
01:42:27,240 --> 01:42:29,034
Sweat and tears.

1271
01:42:32,704 --> 01:42:34,414
All right,
let's get out of here.

1288

I'm so sorry. Your father...

1289
01:44:04,629 --> 01:44:05,839
We know.

1290
01:44:07,758 --> 01:44:09,092
My lord Duke.

1291
01:44:22,856 --> 01:44:23,857
Here.

1292
01:44:25,942 --> 01:44:27,444

1293
01:44:34,701 --> 01:44:37,079
[Duncan] Harkonnens hit
every population center

1294
01:44:37,162 --> 01:44:38,622
on the planet at once.

1295
01:44:38,705 --> 01:44:40,832
There must have been
10 legions, hundreds of ships.

1296
01:44:40,916 --> 01:44:42,959
There were Sardaukar
with them.

1297
01:44:43,043 --> 01:44:45,587
-At least two battalions.
-What? Are you sure?

1298
01:44:45,670 --> 01:44:48,340
You cross swords
with a Sardaukar,

1299
01:44:48,423 --> 01:44:49,800

1300
01:44:49,883 --> 01:44:54,638
[Lady Jessica sighs] So,
the Emperor's taken a side.

1301
01:44:54,721 --> 01:44:57,849
What says
the Judge of the Change?

1302
01:44:57,933 --> 01:44:59,976
The Emperor forbids me
from saying anything at all.

1303
01:45:00,060 --> 01:45:02,020
And yet you risk your life
to help us.

1309

[Dr. Kynes] The storm
will be here in a few hours.

1310
01:45:40,433 --> 01:45:41,560
We'll be safe here.

1311
01:45:43,103 --> 01:45:45,355
Do you know
what this place is?

1312
01:45:45,438 --> 01:45:47,858
It's an old
ecological testing station.

1313
01:45:51,236 --> 01:45:53,071
They were meant
to tame the planet.

1314
01:45:53,155 --> 01:45:55,574
Free the water
locked beneath the sands.

1315
01:45:58,577 --> 01:46:01,204
Arrakis could have been
a paradise.

1316
01:46:01,288 --> 01:46:02,414
The work had begun,

1317
01:46:02,497 --> 01:46:04,166
but then the spice
was discovered.

1318
01:46:04,249 --> 01:46:07,252
And suddenly no one
wanted the desert to go away.

1319

1320
01:46:08,628 --> 01:46:10,213

1323

[wind howling]

1328
01:47:08,855 --> 01:47:10,607
[Paul] You know what
the Great Houses fear most,

1329
01:47:10,690 --> 01:47:12,275
Dr. Kynes?

1330
01:47:13,526 --> 01:47:15,779
Exactly what has happened
to us here.

1331
01:47:16,780 --> 01:47:17,948
The Sardaukar coming

1332
01:47:18,031 --> 01:47:19,741
and picking them off
one by one.

1333
01:47:22,702 --> 01:47:24,329
Only together
can they stand a chance

1334
01:47:24,412 --> 01:47:25,914
against the Imperium.

1335
01:47:27,958 --> 01:47:30,126
Would you bear witness?

1336
01:47:30,210 --> 01:47:33,338
Testify that the Emperor
has moved against us here?

1337
01:47:33,421 --> 01:47:36,341
If they believe me,

1338
01:47:36,424 --> 01:47:38,134
there would be general warfare

1339
01:47:38,218 --> 01:47:40,428
between the Great Houses
and the Emperor.

1340
01:47:40,512 --> 01:47:42,097
Chaos

1341
01:47:42,180 --> 01:47:43,640
across the Imperium.

1342
01:47:43,723 --> 01:47:45,141
Suppose I presented
the Emperor

1343
01:47:45,225 --> 01:47:47,686
with an alternative to chaos.

1344
01:47:47,769 --> 01:47:49,688
The Emperor has no sons.

1345
01:47:49,771 --> 01:47:51,773
And his daughters
have yet to marry.

1346
01:47:51,856 --> 01:47:54,651
You'd make a play
for the throne?

1347
01:47:54,734 --> 01:47:56,486
The Emperor
feared the Atreides.

1348
01:47:56,569 --> 01:47:58,238
He brought you here
to kill you.

1349
01:47:58,321 --> 01:48:00,824
What don't you understand?

1350
01:48:00,907 --> 01:48:04,077

I know you loved
a Fremen warrior

1357
01:48:26,558 --> 01:48:27,851
and lost him in battle.

1358
01:48:31,062 --> 01:48:34,774

and are known by many names.

I've seen your dream.

1360

As emperor, Dr. Kynes,

1361
01:48:47,329 --> 01:48:49,247
I could make
a paradise of Arrakis

1362

02:14:07,138 --> 02:14:09,933
What wealth can you offer
beyond the water

1604
02:14:10,016 --> 02:14:11,560
in your flesh?

1605
02:14:14,354 --> 02:14:16,398
[Stilgar] Hmm...

1606
02:14:16,481 --> 02:14:18,108
The boy is young.

1607
02:14:18,191 --> 02:14:20,402
He can learn our ways.

1608
02:14:20,485 --> 02:14:23,113
He may have sanctuary.

1609
02:14:23,196 --> 02:14:25,532
But the woman is untrained...

1610
02:14:28,201 --> 02:14:29,703
and too old to learn.

1611
02:14:33,373 --> 02:14:35,458

-[both grunt]
-[Stilgar] back, you dogs.

1616
02:15:04,821 --> 02:15:07,032
She'll cut my throat.

1617
02:15:11,995 --> 02:15:14,497
Why didn't you say
you were a weirding woman?

1618
02:15:14,581 --> 02:15:16,249
And a fighter?

1619
02:15:16,333 --> 02:15:18,501
Conversation ran short.

1620
02:15:18,585 --> 02:15:20,795
[Stilgar] Peace, woman.

1621
02:15:20,879 --> 02:15:22,213
Peace.

1622
02:15:23,006 --> 02:15:24,549
I judged hastily.

[girl in English]<i> I would not</i>

They say you're the<i> Mahdi.</i>

1628
02:16:34,119 --> 02:16:35,954
But you look
like a little boy.

1629
02:16:37,455 --> 02:16:38,915
You chose the hardest way up.

1630
02:16:38,999 --> 02:16:40,333
Follow me.

{\an8}[Stilgar speaking Chakobsa]

1632
02:16:47,799 --> 02:16:49,384
[in English] Give it to me.

1633
02:16:56,307 --> 02:16:58,018
You will have
your own maula pistol

1634
02:16:58,101 --> 02:17:00,020
when you've earned it.

1635
02:17:00,103 --> 02:17:01,146
Give it to me.

1636
02:17:06,901 --> 02:17:09,029
Chani, take charge
of the newcomers.

1637
02:17:09,112 --> 02:17:11,740
See that they are safe
on the journey. Let's go.

1638
02:17:11,823 --> 02:17:13,241
[Jamis] I will not have them.

1639
02:17:20,165 --> 02:17:21,583
[Stilgar] Jamis,

1640
02:17:21,666 --> 02:17:24,002
I have spoken. Be still.

1641
02:17:24,085 --> 02:17:25,670
[Jamis] You talk like a leader.

1642
02:17:26,671 --> 02:17:28,548
But the strongest leads.

1643
02:17:29,841 --> 02:17:31,634
She bested you.

1644
02:17:33,053 --> 02:17:35,346
I invoke the amtal.

1645
02:17:35,430 --> 02:17:37,849
[Stilgar] You may not challenge
a<i> Sayyadina.</i>

1646
02:17:37,932 --> 02:17:39,434
Then who will fight
in her name?

1647
02:17:39,517 --> 02:17:42,270
Jamis, don't do this.

1648
02:17:42,353 --> 02:17:44,439
Don't. The night is fading.

1649
02:17:44,522 --> 02:17:47,442
Then the sun
will witness this death.

1650
02:17:47,525 --> 02:17:49,569
Where is her champion?

1651
02:18:00,413 --> 02:18:02,415
I accept her champion.

He won't let you suffer.
