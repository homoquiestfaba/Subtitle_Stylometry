00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:40,051
Our security cameras caught
Matthew vandalizing the church.

5
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,620
Security cameras?

6
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:43,822
The insurance
company requires them.

7
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,869
PASTOR: We're extremely
disappointed in you, Matthew.

8
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:47,626
This is very serious.

9
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:49,639
Sit up, Matthew! The
pastor's talking to you!

10
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:51,207
Would you stop
yelling at him, please?

11
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,664
Yelling at him?

12
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,732
I haven't started
yelling at him!

13
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:56,045
Maybe if you paid
more attention to him

14
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,280
and just tried talking to him...

15
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:59,049
Oh, please! You're one to talk.

16
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:01,372
You're never home,
Miss "I wanna get a job".

17
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:02,652
Well, I had to get a job

18
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:04,876
because somebody... Mr. and
Mrs. Stevenson. Please.

19
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:10,048
Now I've spoken with
the church deacons.

20
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:12,061
We won't bring criminal charges

21
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,296
under the condition the
windows are replaced

22
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,322
and Matthew helps to
fix what he destroyed.

23
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:20,258
You better believe Matthew
will help fix the church.

24
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:21,960
I'll make sure of that.

25
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,639
Oh, so now you want to play Dad?

26
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,196
Would you get off
my back, please?

27
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,098
Why are you always
blaming everything on me?

28
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:28,344
I'm getting sick and tired

29
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:30,768
of hearing it! Jack!
Jack! Rita. Please.

30
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:34,138
Matthew, would you
mind stepping outside?

31
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:36,207
I'd like a word
with your parents.

32
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,082
Don't you go far!

33
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:56,394
Well, it appears the separation
is taking its toll on everyone,

34
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:57,640
especially Matthew.

35
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:59,897
It's been really hard.

36
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,533
Hard or not, vandalizing
the church is unacceptable.

37
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:05,203
Well, this is true. But
you have to understand,

38
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:08,506
Matthew sees his world
as crumbling all around him.

39
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:11,754
I think he's having
real trouble coping.

40
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:13,289
A lot of kids'
parents get divorced.

41
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,273
It's not an excuse
to break the law.

42
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:32,274
PASTOR: Mr. and Mrs. Stevenson,

43
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:34,565
I didn't ask Matthew to
step out to talk about him.

44
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:36,134
RITA: What do you mean?

45
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:38,147
PASTOR: I wanted to talk about
what's going on in your lives.

46
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,071
You know, with the divorce.

47
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,417
I thought we were
here to talk about

48
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,074
what my son did to the church.

49
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:44,609
I took time off
of work for this.

50
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,778
Well, once again,
Jack, it is all about you.

51
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:47,991
Yeah, maybe it... Jack,

52
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:49,993
I do want to talk about that.

53
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:52,328
But have you both
thought about this divorce?

54
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,986
Have you prayed about it?

55
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:57,555
I don't think that prayer can
save this marriage, Pastor.

56
00:05:57,624 --> 00:06:01,126
Oh, never underestimate
the power of prayer, Jack.

57
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,554
But I meant, have
you prayed together?

58
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:06,131
We don't go to church
anymore, Pastor.

59
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:10,034
Well, couples need more than
just going to church together.

60
00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:12,048
They need to work
on building a marriage

61
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:13,716
that's based on a foundation

62
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,940
of equally turning
themselves over to the Lord.

63
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:18,175
Pastor, I am not here
for a counseling session.

64
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:20,123
All right? So if you don't
want to talk to Matthew,

65
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:22,347
I need to get back to work.
You know how busy we are.

66
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:24,760
Well, how are plans on the
new Sunday school coming?

67
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:27,084
Great. We should go
over them later today.

68
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:28,953
Sure. Sure.

69
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:34,459
Oh, I'll make sure Matthew
comes by every day

70
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:36,161
to help out with the repairs.

71
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,134
[Door opens]

72
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:45,403
[Door closes]

73
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,475
He cares more about
his job than his own son.

74
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:53,656
I'm going to pray
for your family, Rita.

75
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,279
I know.

76
00:06:58,318 --> 00:06:59,718
Thanks.

77
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,558
[Door opens]

78
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:10,295
[Door closes]

79
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:43,973
PASTOR: Hello, gentlemen.

80
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:46,564
Pastor, we've been
doing some calculations

81
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,343
and if you want the Sunday
school finished by winter,

82
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:50,401
we need to get the
carved beams and trim

83
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,203
no later than October 30.

84
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:55,974
And that only gives us four
weeks to complete construction.

85
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,575
We're concerned
Mr. Otto won't be able

86
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:58,977
to deliver the wood on time.

87
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,090
Well, Ernest
carved the original,

88
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:03,525
so I think we're lucky
to still have him around.

89
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:05,728
I know since his wife
passed away last year

90
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:07,196
he's been a little
reclusive, but as long

91
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,131
as I've known Ernest, he's
never missed a deadline.

92
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,322
Well, look, I know
the man is a legend

93
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,168
and I know you want the
Sunday school and the church

94
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:14,492
to look the same.

95
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,628
But if we don't get
that wood on time,

96
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:20,197
we're not gonna finish
this project until next spring.

97
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:22,934
We do have a backup
plan. What is that?

98
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,836
Well, we replace the carved
beams with standard beams

99
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:28,740
and all the molding and
trim with new plastic trim.

100
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:30,909
Now, that's all termite-proof,

101
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:33,144
weather-proof and
comes prefabricated.

102
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:35,880
[Sighs] Prefabricated.

103
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:37,793
That just doesn't seem right.

104
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,451
We've already
started the foundation.

105
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,554
Can we just say that if
the wood isn't here on time,

106
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:44,455
we'll have the prefab
stuff ready to go?

107
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:51,663
Well, let's hope old Ernest
can come through with it.

108
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,831
I'll get him on it.
Thank you, sir.

109
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:11,884
Ernest.

110
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:14,518
Pastor.

111
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:17,866
I haven't seen you
in town for a while.

112
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,658
Well, I haven't been
in town for a while.

113
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:24,762
What happened to my
wood? Oh! Vandalism.

114
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:26,330
[Sighs] Can you imagine?

115
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,000
No.

116
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,212
So what do you think?

117
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,702
Can you replace it?

118
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:34,772
I don't think so.

119
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:38,142
Ah, no one else
can match that detail.

120
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:40,244
That "no one else" includes me.

121
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,882
We all miss Christine.

122
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:48,819
I just don't care anymore.

123
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:53,391
Have you prayed about
it? Prayed for guidance?

124
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,438
Never underestimate
the power of prayer.

125
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:57,595
You sound just like her, Pastor.

126
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:00,031
She was truly a
woman of great faith.

127
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,072
Even in her final days, when...

128
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:10,140
her body was
riddled with cancer...

129
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,079
she still believed the
Lord would save her.

130
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:17,048
I even bought into it myself.

131
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,756
I prayed with her every day.

132
00:10:20,554 --> 00:10:22,953
I begged the Lord not to
take her, but he didn't listen.

133
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:24,022
He took her anyway.

134
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:28,292
She prayed for the
Lord to save her.

135
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:30,006
And I believe,
with all my heart,

136
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,274
the Lord answered her prayer.

137
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,532
Answered?

138
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:37,435
Have you taken a look into
the cemetery lately, Pastor?

139
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:39,070
Well, Christine understood

140
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:42,407
that eternal salvation's
of far greater importance

141
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,035
than that of simply
healing one's body.

142
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,459
The Lord answered
her prayer, Ernest.

143
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,483
He brought her home.

144
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,066
What was the first piece
of wood you ever carved?

145
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,523
Do you remember?

146
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,093
It was a plaque
for Sunday school.

147
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,329
I was about eight
or nine years old.

148
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:05,841
Do you remember what it said?

149
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:08,666
I do: "WWJD".

150
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:11,102
"What would Jesus do?"

151
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,491
Sounds like pretty good advice.

152
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,852
Oh, by the way, that plaque...

153
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:19,276
still hangs at the
Sunday school.

154
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:24,515
Well, this is the knife
I used to carve it.

155
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:43,701
Good day, sir.

156
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:46,170
What can I do for
you? Jack Stevenson.

157
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,183
I'm building the Sunday
school over there at the church.

158
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,574
Oh, so I heard. Yeah.

159
00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:52,410
I got some good news for
you... A letter of assignment.

160
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:53,945
A letter of, uh... What is that?

161
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:56,258
It releases you from
your contract and assigns

162
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:58,615
all obligations and liabilities
over to my boss and I.

163
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:00,685
Oh, you're talking
about the wood.

164
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:02,253
Yeah, if you sign it,

165
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:04,300
you're not liable for
holding up the project.

166
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:05,990
You said "not liable for the..."

167
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,592
We're bailing you out.

168
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,141
No one carves wood for
construction anymore, Mr. Otto.

169
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:14,577
It's all done by machines.
It's called prefabrication.

170
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:16,300
Oh, that's what
they're calling it, huh?

171
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:18,547
Yeah, I got a pen
right here for you.

172
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,471
I'm gonna read it
first, if you don't mind.

173
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,707
Yeah, sure, go ahead.
I'll be doing that later.

174
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:27,425
Fair enough.

175
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,882
You know, Mr. Otto,

176
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:33,951
you shouldn't look a
gift horse in the mouth.

177
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:41,326
I'll come back tomorrow.

178
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:44,062
[Engine starts]

179
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,184
Matty, get down here!

180
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:14,592
Oh. Yuck.

181
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:29,473
What's this?

182
00:13:29,543 --> 00:13:32,076
I'm getting a tattoo.
I'm trying the design out.

183
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,377
No way.

184
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:35,057
What's the big
deal? It's just a tattoo.

185
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:36,559
Well, you're having dinner
with your father tonight.

186
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:39,784
You can ask him
about a tattoo... then.

187
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,354
Matthew. Oh, yeah.

188
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:44,702
Dad called yesterday.

189
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,092
You didn't tell me
that. What did he say?

190
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,094
Said he can't make
it tonight. What?

191
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,074
Big surprise, Mom...
He blew us off again.

192
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:53,531
[Sighs] Well, did he say why?

193
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,800
I mean, why didn't he call me?

194
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:57,213
I don't now. He made
plans or something.

195
00:13:57,237 --> 00:13:59,437
Matty, I gotta
work late tonight.

196
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,572
I'm not gonna be
home until after 7:30.

197
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,575
[Sighs]

198
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,613
Um... Well, remember...

199
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,350
You have to work
at the church today

200
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:14,551
and there are hot
dogs in the freezer.

201
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,053
And no tattoos.

202
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:21,025
[Door opens]

203
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:23,794
[Door closes]

204
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:27,331
That's awesome.

205
00:14:30,804 --> 00:14:32,202
[Car engine approaches]

206
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:36,641
[Car engine stops, door opens]

207
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:39,577
[Door closes]

208
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:58,462
It's called wood.

209
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,900
It's not just wood; it's maple.

210
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:05,528
Some foolish person
broke it to pieces.

211
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:11,375
What are you looking at? I
just discovered something.

212
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:12,977
Here, come here.

213
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:15,406
You see this grain,
and how beautiful it is?

214
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:17,426
It's called flame and quilt.

215
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:20,084
Now that only happens
randomly in individual trees.

216
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:23,120
You don't discover it until
after you've sawn the wood.

217
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:32,964
It's just a piece
of broken wood.

218
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:40,505
Not just a broken piece of
wood. It's hardwood maple.

219
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:42,173
It's the wood of
choice for bowling pins,

220
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,875
guitars, pool cues...

221
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:47,879
Even baseball bats.
Baseball bats, huh?

222
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,749
Yeah, most
big-league sluggers...

223
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:52,750
Bam!

224
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:54,152
Use maple bats.

225
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:57,989
Why are you telling me this?

226
00:15:58,058 --> 00:15:59,690
'Cause it's my wood.

227
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,592
What do you mean, yours?

228
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:02,860
I carved it.

229
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:06,296
All of it.

230
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:10,846
Are you the one that's
gonna remake the wood?

231
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,803
The Lord makes the wood.

232
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:14,271
I just carve it.

233
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:17,941
Maybe I will, maybe I won't.

234
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,216
Flame and quilt, huh?

235
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:30,374
Yeah. Flame and quilt.

236
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:35,426
If you wanna see what
I can do with wood,

237
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,795
come up to my place.

238
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:39,329
Where do you live?

239
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:42,867
By the dugouts next to the
horse farm. You know where it is?

240
00:16:42,936 --> 00:16:45,102
Yeah. Good.

241
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,237
Well, it doesn't
mean I'm coming.

242
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:49,666
That's entirely up to you.

243
00:16:57,417 --> 00:17:01,151
[Car door opens and closes]

244
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,955
[Car engine starts]

245

[Clattering]

246
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,383
Mr. Stevenson. Ernest.

247
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:35,163
You have that letter for me?

248
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:36,420
Oh yeah.

249
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:40,538
Great.

250
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:45,062
[Sighs]

251
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:52,570
Uh, you need to
sign this, Ernest.

252
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,373
No, my friend, I... I don't
have to sign anything.

253
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:02,746
All the beams and trim in
what, less than a month?

254
00:18:02,816 --> 00:18:04,293
You can't possibly do that.

255
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:08,252
Well, I've been carving wood
now since before you were born.

256
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:09,532
That's exactly my point.

257
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:11,321
Then again, it's my
problem, not yours, huh?

258
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,890
No, it's my problem.

259
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:15,103
I got a church to fix and
a Sunday school to build.

260
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:17,006
If I don't, I don't get
paid until next year.

261
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,396
How about this?

262
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:21,065
You start building...
and I'll get you the wood.

263
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:24,235
If you don't?

264
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:27,804
Well, if I don't, then I
guess I'll be in default

265
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:29,340
and you can go
ahead and start using

266
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:31,375
all that prefab stuff
you like so much.

267
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:35,139
You need to sign this, Ernest.

268
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:36,814
You'll never get it done.

269
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:28,398
[Groans]

270
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,434
Shouldn't you be in school?

271
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:52,389
I quit.

272
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:01,565
This is how we make
lumber out of timber.

273
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:03,634
Come here and give
me a hand, will you?

274
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:10,340
Shove that saw horse
underneath it, will you?

275
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:17,534
It's been done like this
for thousands of years.

276
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:20,951
Thousands? Yeah, thousands.

277
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,920
Indians used to carve their
own fish hooks and pipe stems.

278
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,867
Polynesians,
they'd carve these...

279
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,459
really intricate
patterns into the panels.

280
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,615
Yeah, but thousands? Thousands.

281
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:35,284
Jesus carved wood.
He was a carpenter.

282
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:37,534
Jesus, huh?

283
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:40,123
Yeah, our savior
was a woodcarver.

284
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:46,610
You, uh...

285
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:49,159
You got any interest in
doing something this old?

286
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,284
Sure.

287
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:55,385
Hm!

288
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,990
Step into my office. I
wanna show you something.

289
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,262
These are the tools of the
trade. This is a carving knife.

290
00:21:05,331 --> 00:21:08,798
Used for paring,
cutting, smooth edges.

291
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:13,404
This... is a gouge.

292
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:14,749
It's got a curved edge here

293
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:18,375
for carving hollows
and rounds...

294
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:21,211
other curves in the wood.

295
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,014
This here is a
chisel. Straight, see?

296
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,684
It's used for flat
surfaces, mostly,

297
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:29,097
or creating a line for an inlay.

298
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:32,889
This is the v-tool that
emphasizes your lines for you.

299
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,691
It gives it a 3D effect.

300
00:21:34,761 --> 00:21:36,693
And this is the veiner.

301
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:37,795
See that?

302
00:21:37,864 --> 00:21:39,429
Creates deep gouges.

303
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:44,535
How'd you learn so
much about carving wood?

304
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:46,070
Well, that's what I do.

305
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,373
I've been doing
it for a long time.

306
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:52,642
Say, what is it that you do
now that you've quit school?

307
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,114
I'm not sure yet.

308
00:21:57,183 --> 00:21:59,383
I'm thinking about
joining the military.

309
00:22:00,453 --> 00:22:02,386
I just need to get
away from my parents.

310
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:05,289
Hm.

311
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:07,269
Well, you know,
joining the military's...

312
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:10,961
that's a very honorable
and noble thing to do, but...

313
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,308
I'm not quite so sure I'd, uh...

314
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,377
join just to get away
from my parents.

315
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:17,201
Well, I gotta do something.

316
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,503
I can't take them
anymore, you know?

317
00:22:20,573 --> 00:22:22,005
Oh, yeah.

318
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:25,076
Yeah, yeah.

319
00:22:25,144 --> 00:22:26,810
So tell me, kid...

320
00:22:28,114 --> 00:22:30,347
why'd you try to
destroy the church?

321
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:36,086
How'd you know it was me?

322
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:39,256
Well, it's a small town.
[Chuckles] Come on!

323
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:40,691
Word gets around.

324
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,729
Do you want me to leave?

325
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:48,632
Nah.

326
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,968
I've made enough
mistakes in my life...

327
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:53,771
things I'm not proud of.

328
00:22:57,543 --> 00:23:00,043
You know, everybody
makes mistakes.

329
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:02,679
The key to that is how
you make 'em right.

330
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:06,476
So how can I fix what I did?

331
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,885
Well, you can ask
for forgiveness.

332
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:10,854
Forgiveness from the pastor?

333
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:14,069
Or from you? Well...

334
00:23:14,093 --> 00:23:15,559
asking the pastor
for forgiveness

335
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:17,461
is a good place to start, sure.

336
00:23:18,531 --> 00:23:20,397
But I was thinking
more of, uh...

337
00:23:20,466 --> 00:23:22,165
asking the Lord for forgiveness.

338
00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:26,837
You mean pray. Yeah.

339
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:34,144
I've prayed before.

340
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:37,795
It never works.

341
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:45,189
Listen, kid, I've got an idea.

342
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:49,359
Why don't, uh, you
and I work together

343
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,528
and fix that church up, huh?

344
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:53,731
I could use the help.

345
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:57,000
Well, I'm supposed
to, but... what can I do?

346
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:59,080
I mean, I... I don't know
anything about carving wood.

347
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:01,071
Yeah, but I do.

348
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:03,051
You know, now that
I got a little bit of a...

349
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:05,275
hitch in my giddy-up,

350
00:24:05,344 --> 00:24:07,077
I could sure use the help

351
00:24:07,146 --> 00:24:09,657
humping around those
big pieces of timber.

352
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:11,715
What do you say?

353
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,083
I could do that.

354
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:14,718
Okay.

355
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,220
Step over here.

356
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:23,019
Take this strap off the
block for me, will you?

357
00:25:04,737 --> 00:25:07,097
Sure does take a lot
more time than I thought.

358
00:25:11,477 --> 00:25:12,643
Hey, um...

359
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,146
my dad works at Sandstone.

360
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,790
He's in charge of building
the Sunday school.

361
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:23,253
I know. I recognized
the last name.

362
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:29,760
He doesn't want you
to make the wood.

363
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:32,929
He doesn't think you can.
[Chuckles] He told me as much.

364
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:34,576
Well, how much do
you have to make?

365
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,534
Four carved beams and all
the trim by the end of October.

366
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:41,817
Can you do it?

367
00:25:41,841 --> 00:25:45,042
Well, with two men
working, you bet I can.

368
00:25:45,845 --> 00:25:47,177
JACK: Matthew!

369
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:53,116
What are you doing
here? Working, Dad.

370
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:54,696
You're supposed to be
working at the church.

371
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,354
Well, Pastor Clark
told me to help Mr. Otto.

372
00:25:57,423 --> 00:26:00,024
I told the pastor you'd
be working at the church.

373
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:01,458
Not here.

374
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,194
Get home.

375
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:06,696
But, Dad... Don't but
me, Matthew. Home.

376
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:10,166
Now! Matthew, home!

377
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,757
You knew he was my son?

378
00:26:33,826 --> 00:26:34,858
I did.

379
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,538
You know he quit school,
vandalized the church?

380
00:26:36,562 --> 00:26:39,462
Broke the windows,
costing me a fortune?

381
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:41,865
I did. I don't want
him working here.

382
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:45,635
Well, it was my wood he damaged.
And the right thing would be

383
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:47,716
for him to own up to it
and work to make it right.

384
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,439
You don't tell me
how to raise my boy!

385
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:50,685
I wouldn't dream of it.

386
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:53,149
You're doing one
heck of a job yourself.

387
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:54,711
All right.

388
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,083
I don't want him
involved in this.

389
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:05,055
We want to give you
eighty cents on the dollar

390
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,557
to take over your contract.

391
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,704
Eighty cents on the
dollar, don't have to work.

392
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:11,628
Sounds great, no thanks.

393
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,999
My boss is willing to
go as high as a buck.

394
00:27:16,068 --> 00:27:18,046
And that's without you
delivering one piece of wood.

395
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,470
Again, sounds like a great
deal, but I have to pass.

396
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:22,939
Ernest, it's free money!

397
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,674
Why don't you just take it?

398
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:28,211
Well... I know it
sounds foolish, but...

399
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,014
over the years I've
been accustomed to...

400
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:33,161
getting paid for
doing a job and...

401
00:27:33,185 --> 00:27:36,120
cashing a check for doing
nothing just doesn't seem right.

402
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,455
[Groans]

403
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:43,393
I'm offering you a
way out here, Ernest.

404
00:27:43,462 --> 00:27:45,162
I suggest you take it.

405
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:48,677
I, uh, hear that loud and clear

406
00:27:48,701 --> 00:27:51,601
and I'm declining your offer.

407
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:56,406
All right, suit yourself.

408
00:27:58,277 --> 00:28:01,144
My son does not work here.

409
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:04,147
And you keep him out of
this, do you understand me?

410
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:15,692
Oh, dear Lord.

411
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:52,095
This house is falling
apart without me.

412
00:28:57,369 --> 00:28:58,635
Unbelievable.

413
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,906
[Knocking]

414
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:12,182
Where is he? In his room.

415
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:18,921
Matthew, get down here!

416
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:21,124
Now!

417
00:29:22,661 --> 00:29:24,472
He tell you what happened? Yes.

418
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:26,329
And? And what?

419
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:29,144
It's no big deal to you?

420
00:29:29,168 --> 00:29:30,612
You know, I had
plans the other night.

421
00:29:30,636 --> 00:29:32,569
You were supposed to
take your son out to dinner.

422
00:29:32,638 --> 00:29:33,798
Plans?

423
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:36,739
Oh, right, right.

424
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:40,210
Uh, beauty parlor, yoga...

425
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,012
What else? Boyfriend?

426
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,658
That's none of your
business. It is my business.

427
00:29:43,682 --> 00:29:45,660
We're not divorced
yet. Would you stop it?

428
00:29:45,684 --> 00:29:48,124
Your days of telling
me what to do are over.

429
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:51,799
Well, by the looks
of this place...

430
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:53,263
someone needs to
tell you what to do.

431
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,960
Well, it is not gonna
be you. It's fine with me.

432
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:01,598
RITA: We need to talk to you.

433
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:02,765
Sit!

434
00:30:08,574 --> 00:30:10,552
We need to talk to you
about quitting school.

435
00:30:10,576 --> 00:30:13,543
[Chuckles] You guys are
gonna play parents now, huh?

436
00:30:13,612 --> 00:30:15,879
Do not take that tone
of voice... What tone?!

437
00:30:15,948 --> 00:30:17,125
Don't talk to your
mother like that!

438
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:19,249
Like what?

439
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:20,650
Like you do?

440
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:22,296
Oh, well, Jack,
he's got you there.

441
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,788
Enough! [Rita sighs]

442
00:30:24,857 --> 00:30:27,690
We're here to talk
about you, young man.

443
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,138
Why were you at
Mr. Otto's house?

444
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:31,606
Pastor Clark told
me to help him.

445
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,964
Pastor Clark told you you
had to fix what you destroyed.

446
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:35,298
That's why he sent me there.

447
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:36,900
He's carving the
wood for the church.

448
00:30:36,969 --> 00:30:39,247
No, he's not. Sandstone is
doing it or we don't get paid.

449
00:30:39,271 --> 00:30:41,016
RITA: Jack, will
you just stop it?

450
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,006
Stop involving him
in your work problems.

451
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:45,609
He involved himself when he
took a baseball bat to the church.

452
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,388
Maybe if you'd been
around a little bit more...

453
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:49,090
Don't start with me!
Don't start with you?

454
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:50,380
You know what, guys?

455
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:53,283
Fine!

456
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,252
I don't wanna work there anyway.

457
00:30:56,721 --> 00:30:59,088
Good, 'cause
you're not going to.

458
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:01,157
Fine!

459
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:02,325
Matthew!

460
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:06,307
[Door slams]

461
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:07,411
[Sighs]

462
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,102
Are you happy?

463
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:13,170
Look what you did.

464
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,580
What I did?

465
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:19,520
All I did was tell him I didn't
want him to work for Mr. Otto.

466
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,843
What's the big deal?

467
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:23,079
We told the pastor that he
would help fix the church.

468
00:31:23,148 --> 00:31:24,914
What's the big deal?

469
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:27,617
The man is taking
money out of our pockets.

470
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:29,764
What do you think
pays for all this?

471
00:31:29,788 --> 00:31:31,755
You're unbelievable.

472
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:33,156
I'm unbelievable.

473
00:31:43,035 --> 00:31:44,634
I don't think he
can make it, Jerry.

474
00:31:44,703 --> 00:31:46,248
Well, he'd better not make it.

475
00:31:46,272 --> 00:31:47,915
We got other church
bids coming in.

476
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:51,707
I don't want anybody
asking for Otto's wood.

477
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:53,888
You know, this is all
about the partnership

478
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,512
we were talking about.

479
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:58,548
I'm gonna have the beams
and the deck trim all ready to go.

480
00:31:58,617 --> 00:32:01,551
The minute he doesn't
deliver, nobody's gonna give us

481
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,540
any problem about
starting with ours.

482
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:06,622
Agreed.

483
00:32:06,692 --> 00:32:09,258
And he's not
gonna deliver, Jack.

484
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:11,094
I can promise you that.

485
00:32:21,206 --> 00:32:22,806
[Vehicle approaches]

486
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,088
Pastor Clark...

487
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:42,024
said I had to help you.

488
00:32:43,562 --> 00:32:44,861
I see.

489
00:32:49,034 --> 00:32:50,133
Ah.

490
00:32:51,537 --> 00:32:54,037
So... what's with the backpack?

491
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:57,453
I can't live with my
mom or my dad anymore.

492
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:02,184
And, uh, where
are you gonna live?

493
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,600
I've gotta call your parents.

494
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:37,447
You guys can't stop
me from running away.

495
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,515
I don't wanna live
with either of you.

496
00:33:39,585 --> 00:33:42,518
Where are you gonna
live? I don't care.

497
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:44,254
Anywhere but with you.

498
00:33:44,323 --> 00:33:46,890
Matthew, we were worried.
Mom, I can take care of myself.

499
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:48,724
JACK: Really?

500
00:33:48,794 --> 00:33:51,595
How you gonna feed yourself,
huh? How you gonna get a job?

501
00:33:51,663 --> 00:33:53,663
Find a place to
live?! I don't know!

502
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:01,538
I don't know. All I know is, I
don't wanna live with you...

503
00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:04,874
or with you, Mom.

504
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,113
You listen, Mr. "I
wanna be on my own"...

505
00:34:10,182 --> 00:34:12,394
This is none of my
business... You're right it's not!

506
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:16,085
RITA: Jack! I can appreciate
that, Mr. Stevenson.

507
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:19,322
I'm not about tell anybody
how to raise their child.

508
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:23,059
But if your boy needs a
place to stay to clear his head...

509
00:34:23,128 --> 00:34:24,927
then he can stay here with me.

510
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:26,696
Lord knows, I could
use the company.

511
00:34:26,765 --> 00:34:27,845
[Sighs]

512
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:31,901
Can I, Mom?

513
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,543
Well? Well?

514
00:34:40,612 --> 00:34:43,112
You're not actually
considering this, are you?

515
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:47,050
Matthew, I am
telling you right now...

516
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:56,760
JACK: Just forget it. Forget it!

517
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,030
You stay right there.

518
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:12,587
What am I gonna do with him?

519
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:15,512
Huh? I wanna throw him
in the back of the truck!

520
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,646
I know.

521
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:20,416
But right now I think he
just needs a little space.

522
00:35:20,486 --> 00:35:22,385
[Sighs]

523
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:24,921
His whole world's being
turned upside down.

524
00:35:30,562 --> 00:35:31,862
I know.

525
00:35:33,899 --> 00:35:36,732
But I don't think us turning
our son over to Ernest Otto

526
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:37,911
is the answer.

527
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:39,902
We're not turning
him over to anyone.

528
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,805
I just think he needs a break.

529
00:35:41,874 --> 00:35:44,741
This is your week with him.

530
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,621
If you're comfortable
with him with Ernest...

531
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:49,512
Jack, I really don't see how
a couple of days could hurt.

532
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:54,150
Just make sure it's a
couple of days, okay?

533
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,321
[Owl hoots]

534
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:26,282
[Shuts cupboard door]

535
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,365
Hey, good morning!

536
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:43,900
Good morning.

537
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,185
Ah! Little early for you, huh?

538
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,209
Yeah.

539
00:36:53,278 --> 00:36:56,178
Last time I got up this early
was to go fishing with my dad.

540
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:01,851
Hey, listen,

541
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:03,519
if you're gonna stay here,

542
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:06,068
I want you to make me
a simple promise, okay?

543
00:37:07,259 --> 00:37:10,025
Yeah, sure, what is it? Okay.

544
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:13,930
Before you do anything, I need
you to ask yourself a question.

545
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:15,498
A question?

546
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,400
Yeah.

547
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:21,637
"WWJD?" What's that?

548
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:25,141
Well, it's short for,
"What would Jesus do?"

549
00:37:26,778 --> 00:37:28,344
Jesus?

550
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:31,514
Yeah, before you make
any choice or decision,

551
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:35,018
I just want you to ask
yourself that simple question.

552
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,486
What would Jesus do? That's all.

553
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:40,690
See, Jesus came down to
earth to set an example for us.

554
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:45,328
I thought he came down to,
like... die for us or something.

555
00:37:45,397 --> 00:37:47,208
Oh yeah, that too, but...

556
00:37:47,232 --> 00:37:50,967
but he also came
down to sort of, uh...

557
00:37:51,036 --> 00:37:52,316
show us the way.

558
00:37:54,873 --> 00:37:58,307
Okay. All right,
well, let's see.

559
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:00,288
Do you think Jesus
woulda quit school?

560
00:38:00,312 --> 00:38:02,056
They didn't have schools
back when Jesus lived.

561
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,613
[Laughs] Well, all right.

562
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,551
You think Jesus would
have vandalized a church?

563
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:12,722
No. There you go.

564
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,357
See how it works?

565
00:38:16,028 --> 00:38:17,961
Yeah. All right.

566
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,776
All I'm asking you to
do is to consider that

567
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,500
before you take
any course of action

568
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:28,170
anytime, anywhere,
anytime in your life.

569
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:31,273
Just ask that simple question:
What would Jesus do?

570
00:38:33,245 --> 00:38:34,777
That's all.

571
00:38:34,846 --> 00:38:35,879
Okay.

572
00:38:39,084 --> 00:38:41,329
So you don't like
that stuff, huh?

573
00:38:41,353 --> 00:38:43,519
No, it's no good.

574
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:47,534
Yeah, try not to eat
through the enamel.

575
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:48,624
[Chuckles]

576
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:09,111
How's this? Let's see.

577
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:11,661
Put it right up here.

578
00:39:12,918 --> 00:39:14,317
Okay, watch your fingers.

579
00:39:16,621 --> 00:39:18,599
There you go. Now, that's nice.

580
00:39:18,623 --> 00:39:20,968
See how the grain
is nice and tight?

581
00:39:20,992 --> 00:39:23,512
The way it flows would
be perfect for the wood trim.

582
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:27,196
And it's got that nice,
honey-colored hue as well.

583
00:39:27,265 --> 00:39:29,705
Um, let's put it on the bench.

584
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,479
How you gonna
make all the spaces

585
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:33,969
so perfectly spaced apart?

586
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:36,271
I'll use my fingers.

587
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:39,208
I've also been doing
this since I was in diapers.

588
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:41,577
Really? No, not really.

589
00:39:41,646 --> 00:39:43,323
I was, uh... I was 15 years old

590
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:45,092
when I started. Wow.

591
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:46,961
Grab me a couple
of clamps, would you?

592
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:48,784
You started work at 15?

593
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:52,989
Yeah. Yeah, my folks passed
away and left me this house

594
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,925
and a crop of maple
and myrtle trees.

595
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:59,862
You were alone at 15? Yeah.

596
00:39:59,931 --> 00:40:01,430
I sure was.

597
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:04,066
That's insane. Yeah.

598
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:07,269
Well, I'm almost 16 and
I wanna be on my own.

599
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:10,139
Well, you know, times
were a lot different back then.

600
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:12,527
People just grew
up a lot faster.

601
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:16,690
I don't want you to
think it was easy for me.

602
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:18,392
It wasn't. It was pretty tough.

603
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,927
If it wasn't for Christine...

604
00:40:19,951 --> 00:40:22,029
I probably wouldn't
have made it.

605
00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:23,286
Who's Christine?

606
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,355
She was my wife.

607
00:40:29,027 --> 00:40:30,938
Yeah, she was the
one who talked me into

608
00:40:30,962 --> 00:40:33,362
taking my father's
trees, carving 'em and...

609
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:34,711
selling them myself.

610
00:40:36,401 --> 00:40:38,100
Yeah...

611
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:40,649
she was always right
about stuff like that.

612
00:40:41,506 --> 00:40:43,850
Okay, let's get
back to work here.

613
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:45,154
Start at the end.

614
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,143
Plain and smooth.

615
00:40:58,790 --> 00:40:59,830
Hey, Ernest?

616
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:04,193
I know something Jesus would do.

617
00:41:04,262 --> 00:41:05,528
Oh yeah?

618
00:41:05,597 --> 00:41:06,929
What's that?

619
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:08,931
If he'd quit school...

620
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,068
he'd definitely go back.

621
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:15,772
I do believe you're right.

622
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:34,702
MATTHEW: You're the
one that's not listening to me.

623
00:41:34,726 --> 00:41:36,871
You just keep saying the
same thing over and over

624
00:41:36,895 --> 00:41:39,272
but it's not gonna
change anything.

625
00:41:39,296 --> 00:41:42,932
Would you stop talking back
to me? Matthew, listen to me!

626
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:45,668
You have to come home.
No, Mom, I'm staying right here.

627
00:41:45,737 --> 00:41:47,848
You can't stay here
forever. This isn't your home.

628
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:49,632
It's more of a home
than I've had in a while.

629
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:54,677
Why are you doing this to
me? Mom, it's not about you.

630
00:41:54,746 --> 00:41:56,145
It's about me and what I need.

631
00:41:56,214 --> 00:41:57,780
What you need?

632
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:01,351
I don't wanna
live in your house.

633
00:42:01,419 --> 00:42:03,887
I don't wanna live in Dad's
house. I'm happy here.

634
00:42:05,957 --> 00:42:07,401
What you need to do, young man,

635
00:42:07,425 --> 00:42:09,945
is to come home and
be with your family.

636
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:12,696
What family, Mom?

637
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:21,237
Matt...

638
00:42:22,406 --> 00:42:24,240
oh, you know what?

639
00:42:37,188 --> 00:42:38,188
[Owl hoots]

640
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:49,899
He's... doing his
schoolwork? He has to.

641
00:42:49,968 --> 00:42:52,468
It's part of his
promise. Promise?

642
00:42:52,537 --> 00:42:55,971
Yeah. Matthew and I
came to an agreement,

643
00:42:56,041 --> 00:42:58,041
a contract of sorts,
that he has to abide by

644
00:42:58,109 --> 00:43:01,177
in order to stay here. Oh.

645
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:03,846
Keeping up with his
schoolwork is part of the deal.

646
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:06,060
Where'd he get those books?

647
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:09,051
Oh, those were my wife's
books. She was a teacher.

648
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,719
Oh, I remember your wife.

649
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:16,192
You were married a
long time, weren't you?

650
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:20,029
Yeah. Seems like a day to
me, but, uh, yeah, over 40 years.

651
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:24,667
That time with Christine...
The best years of my life.

652
00:43:24,736 --> 00:43:27,269
Well, I wish I had
a marriage like that.

653
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:30,306
No problems, always
getting along, happiness.

654
00:43:30,375 --> 00:43:32,942
[Chuckles] No
problems, no fights?

655
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,812
Even if you're in
the perfect marriage,

656
00:43:36,881 --> 00:43:41,217
there's always gonna be
bumps, and we had our fair share.

657
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:44,053
But you both got
through them. How?

658
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:47,589
Well, Christine and I
had something that...

659
00:43:48,893 --> 00:43:50,792
many couples don't have.

660
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:52,561
So what's that?

661
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:53,795
The Lord.

662
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:57,966
We turned our lives, our
marriage, everything...

663
00:43:58,036 --> 00:44:01,537
over to Jesus. We put
ourselves in his hands.

664
00:44:01,606 --> 00:44:03,884
You're saying the Lord
helped you with your marriage?

665
00:44:03,908 --> 00:44:07,209
Well, he showed us the
way through his example,

666
00:44:07,278 --> 00:44:09,645
his teaching, his word.

667
00:44:09,714 --> 00:44:11,814
What example? Jesus
wasn't even married.

668
00:44:11,883 --> 00:44:15,885
His example of kindness,
of understanding...

669
00:44:15,953 --> 00:44:17,787
most importantly...

670
00:44:17,856 --> 00:44:19,021
sacrifice.

671
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:20,857
And his word?

672
00:44:20,925 --> 00:44:23,993
Well, his word was the Bible.

673
00:44:28,266 --> 00:44:29,977
How can the Bible help
me with my marriage?

674
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:33,002
That thing was written
over 2,000 years ago.

675
00:44:33,071 --> 00:44:34,403
[Door opens]

676
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,606
Hey, Mr. Otto?

677
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:40,743
I need help with a question.
Why don't you go back inside?

678
00:44:40,811 --> 00:44:43,378
I'll be in in a minute. I'm just
saying goodnight to your mom.

679
00:44:44,748 --> 00:44:47,717
Goodnight, Mom.
I love you, Matty.

680
00:44:48,786 --> 00:44:50,052
I love you too.

681
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:54,123
[Door closes]

682
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:02,331
He wants to stay.

683
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,903
Well... [Sighs] ...the kid
just needs some space.

684
00:45:06,971 --> 00:45:10,205
But I promise you,
as soon as he's ready,

685
00:45:10,274 --> 00:45:11,673
I'll give him the heave-ho.

686
00:45:13,344 --> 00:45:14,543
Well, um...

687
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:21,450
thank you for taking
care of my son...

688
00:45:23,154 --> 00:45:25,132
and for being so understanding.

689
00:45:25,156 --> 00:45:26,156
Mrs. Stevenson...

690
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:31,660
Christine and I made it
through 40-plus years...

691
00:45:32,697 --> 00:45:34,230
because we had balance.

692
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:40,502
By balance you mean you and
your wife were equally in charge?

693
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:43,372
No, our marriage had balance

694
00:45:43,441 --> 00:45:46,542
but, uh, Christ was
the head of our family.

695
00:45:50,948 --> 00:45:54,283
Goodnight, Mr. Otto.
Goodnight, Mrs. Stevenson.

696
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:05,895
Still need help
with the question?

697
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:07,396
No, I got it.

698
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:10,132
Good man.

699
00:46:26,184 --> 00:46:27,716
[Phone ringing]

700

00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:53,055
Honey?

702
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:56,312
Who was that?

703
00:46:57,781 --> 00:46:59,248
Dr. Anabe.

704
00:47:01,386 --> 00:47:03,185
The specialist?

705
00:47:03,254 --> 00:47:04,786
What did he want?

706
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:10,959
The test was positive
for cancer, Ernest.

707
00:47:11,029 --> 00:47:13,362
It's called a blastoma.

708
00:47:13,431 --> 00:47:16,732
He said most patients
die within months.

709
00:47:17,735 --> 00:47:20,336
There's gotta be some mistake.

710
00:47:20,405 --> 00:47:22,871
There's no way. Oh Lord.

711
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:24,706
No, no mistake.

712
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:27,510
No mistake, Ernest. I am sorry.

713
00:47:29,547 --> 00:47:31,580
Oh, sweet Christine.

714
00:47:31,649 --> 00:47:33,815
[Sobs] I prayed so hard.

715
00:47:34,985 --> 00:47:37,886
First my boy and now...

716
00:47:37,955 --> 00:47:42,124
Honey, honey, the Lord
has a plan for all of us.

717
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:47,029
[Sobbing] Oh why?

718
00:47:47,098 --> 00:47:48,397
Why?

719
00:47:49,734 --> 00:47:51,100
[Clattering]

720
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:00,109
[Clattering]

721
00:48:04,148 --> 00:48:05,380
[Splashing]

722
00:48:29,707 --> 00:48:31,106
[Gasps]

723
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:34,176
Matty!

724
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:35,678
Matty, get up!

725
00:48:41,786 --> 00:48:43,118
Ernest, what's going on?

726
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:45,688
Ernest!

727
00:48:57,968 --> 00:48:59,367
What are you doing?

728
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:01,003
Ernest, the fire!

729
00:49:01,071 --> 00:49:03,238
The wood is burning!
What are you doing?

730
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:10,245
It's all right,
Matty. It's gone.

731
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:15,617
There's nothing
we can do about it.

732
00:49:15,686 --> 00:49:17,186
Can't be gone.

733
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:30,900
[Crow cawing]

734
00:49:54,459 --> 00:49:56,158
[Saw buzzes]

735
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:15,190
Ernest, what are you doing?

736
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:16,890
Ernest, what are you doing?

737
00:50:16,914 --> 00:50:19,248
[Saw buzzes]

738
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:21,216
What? What are you doing?

739
00:50:22,887 --> 00:50:24,186
[Turns off saw]

740
00:50:26,891 --> 00:50:29,424
I'm making lumber out of
timber so I can cut some wood.

741
00:50:29,494 --> 00:50:31,972
Yeah, but what's the point?
We don't have enough time.

742
00:50:31,996 --> 00:50:34,129
Well, we're gonna have
to find some more time.

743
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:36,399
How? Well, you can start by...

744
00:50:36,467 --> 00:50:38,634
stacking these up
on the bench for me.

745
00:50:41,572 --> 00:50:44,573
Look, son, you've
only got two choices.

746
00:50:44,642 --> 00:50:47,410
You can either lend a
hand or get out of the way.

747
00:50:47,478 --> 00:50:50,413
Now, I'm pretty sure I know
which choice Jesus would make.

748
00:50:50,481 --> 00:50:52,181
[Saw buzzes]

749
00:51:11,168 --> 00:51:13,080
ERNEST: Excuse
me, can I have a word?

750
00:51:13,104 --> 00:51:14,836
Yeah, sure.

751
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:20,087
We lost a lot of
the lumber in a fire.

752
00:51:20,111 --> 00:51:22,744
Fire? What fire?

753
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:24,224
[Sighs] Where's Matthew?

754
00:51:24,248 --> 00:51:26,315
Matthew's fine.

755
00:51:26,383 --> 00:51:28,984
But most of the wood
we carved got lost and...

756
00:51:29,052 --> 00:51:31,412
I'm gonna need some
time to carve some more.

757
00:51:33,457 --> 00:51:34,923
How'd the fire start?

758
00:51:37,895 --> 00:51:39,160
I don't know.

759
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:45,534
Matthew didn't...?
No. It wasn't Matthew.

760
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:47,336
Look, Mr. Stevenson,

761
00:51:47,404 --> 00:51:51,740
I just need a few more
days. I can't help you out.

762
00:51:51,809 --> 00:51:53,887
Look, in a few days I can
get you the entire load.

763
00:51:53,911 --> 00:51:56,223
In the meantime, I can get
you enough wood to get started.

764
00:51:56,247 --> 00:51:58,292
I can still offer you a release
to get out of the contract,

765
00:51:58,316 --> 00:51:59,748
all right? That's it.

766
00:51:59,817 --> 00:52:03,352
Hey, I'll get you your wood.
You'll never get it done.

767
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,732
Well, we'll see about that, huh?

768
00:52:05,756 --> 00:52:07,723
How'd you get him
to go back to school?

769
00:52:07,792 --> 00:52:11,093
Well, he promised me he
would do what Jesus would do.

770
00:52:11,162 --> 00:52:14,697
And we decided that...
Jesus wouldn't quit school.

771
00:52:14,765 --> 00:52:16,631
Jesus?

772
00:52:16,701 --> 00:52:20,236
He hated church, remember?
He took a baseball bat to one.

773
00:52:20,304 --> 00:52:22,071
Ah, he doesn't hate church.

774
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:26,008
Disappointed in church,
disappointed in the Lord.

775
00:52:26,077 --> 00:52:28,910
He thinks he got
betrayed, let down.

776
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:30,612
How was he betrayed?

777
00:52:30,681 --> 00:52:33,121
Well, he prayed that
his parents wouldn't, uh,

778
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,383
get a divorce.

779
00:52:35,453 --> 00:52:37,653
He told you that?
Yeah. He told me that.

780
00:52:40,123 --> 00:52:42,090
We used to go to church
every Sunday. I mean...

781
00:52:43,461 --> 00:52:45,561
Well, then Jerry offered
me, you know, more money

782
00:52:45,629 --> 00:52:47,507
to partner with him in
the construction business

783
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:50,132
and Rita got busy and...
church took a back seat.

784
00:52:50,201 --> 00:52:52,534
Next thing you know, I'm
on my way to a divorce.

785
00:52:52,603 --> 00:52:55,270
Well, the times you
did go to church,

786
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:57,839
Matthew apparently
learned that, through Christ,

787
00:52:57,908 --> 00:53:00,809
families stay together,
and now he feels betrayed.

788
00:53:00,878 --> 00:53:04,046
Rita and I getting a divorce has
nothing to do with my son, all right?

789
00:53:04,115 --> 00:53:06,248
I love my son, Ernie.

790
00:53:06,317 --> 00:53:08,350
Well, I'm sure you do.

791
00:53:08,419 --> 00:53:11,153
But I'm not the one you
should be telling this to.

792
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:36,070
Do you think my mom and
dad will ever get back together?

793
00:53:39,116 --> 00:53:40,949
Have you prayed about it?

794
00:53:41,018 --> 00:53:43,263
Last night I prayed that
they'd get back together

795
00:53:43,287 --> 00:53:45,687
and be happy like
you and your wife were.

796
00:53:47,024 --> 00:53:48,123
That'd be nice.

797
00:53:51,428 --> 00:53:52,828
Yeah.

798
00:53:57,768 --> 00:53:59,368
I wish I could have met her.

799
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,706
You want to?

800
00:54:06,777 --> 00:54:07,777
What?

801
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:21,924
ERNEST: Meet my wife Christine.

802
00:54:21,993 --> 00:54:23,325
Christine, honey,

803
00:54:23,394 --> 00:54:26,060
this is the boy that's
been staying at the house,

804
00:54:26,129 --> 00:54:29,531
helping carve the wood
for your Sunday school.

805
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,959
She's not actually here, is she?

806
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:34,936
No, she's in my heart.

807
00:54:35,005 --> 00:54:37,639
But... she's really
with the Lord.

808
00:54:40,177 --> 00:54:41,457
But you talk to her?

809
00:54:41,512 --> 00:54:45,380
That's my way of
feeling close and...

810
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:47,082
remembering her.

811
00:54:49,186 --> 00:54:50,819
Does she talk back to you?

812
00:54:50,887 --> 00:54:52,720
I hear her voice
sometimes, sure,

813
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:55,424
but that's, uh,
from my memories.

814
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,126
She's in a better place now.

815
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:12,541
Ernest, what are we
gonna do? About what?

816
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:14,910
Well, we lost all those days.

817
00:55:16,547 --> 00:55:17,846
Well, the only thing we can do

818
00:55:17,915 --> 00:55:19,681
is roll up our sleeves
and get back to work.

819
00:55:21,352 --> 00:55:23,485
Do you think someone
we know started the fire?

820
00:55:25,089 --> 00:55:26,921
I don't know what
to think about that.

821
00:55:28,959 --> 00:55:32,928
Well, why don't you call
the police or something?

822
00:55:32,997 --> 00:55:36,665
I filled out a police report,
but there's nothing they can do.

823
00:55:38,536 --> 00:55:40,112
I'm going to my mom's.
I'll talk to you later.

824
00:55:40,136 --> 00:55:41,470
All right.

825
00:55:51,815 --> 00:55:53,748
[Engine starts]

826
00:56:24,882 --> 00:56:27,382
Hi, Mom. Hi. Uh...

827
00:56:29,019 --> 00:56:31,053
How are you?

828
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:32,787
I'm fine, Mom. I'm just...

829
00:57:10,394 --> 00:57:12,714
What are you doing in here?

830
00:57:13,563 --> 00:57:16,198
Is everything
okay at Mr. Otto's?

831
00:57:16,267 --> 00:57:17,267
It's fine.

832
00:57:17,334 --> 00:57:19,234
You don't look fine.

833
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,907
We had a fire that
burned all our wood.

834
00:57:25,976 --> 00:57:29,010
I know. Mr. Otto called me to
let me know you were all right.

835
00:57:31,048 --> 00:57:32,146
Mom, do...

836
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:35,817
I just...

837
00:57:37,087 --> 00:57:38,152
What is it?

838
00:57:39,489 --> 00:57:40,489
Nothing.

839
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:46,441
Matthew.

840
00:57:47,598 --> 00:57:50,158
Tell me what's bothering you.

841
00:57:54,405 --> 00:57:55,637
Mom...

842
00:57:58,409 --> 00:58:00,576
do you think Dad
started the fire?

843
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:01,810
No!

844
00:58:01,878 --> 00:58:04,079
[Sighs]

845
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,580
Why do you think that?

846
00:58:07,117 --> 00:58:09,237
Mr. Otto asked him for a
few more days and he said no.

847
00:58:10,353 --> 00:58:11,586
Oh, Matty.

848
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:17,011
Honey, your father
has his issues...

849
00:58:18,528 --> 00:58:21,196
but at heart he is an
honest and a decent man.

850
00:58:23,133 --> 00:58:24,133
Okay?

851
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:37,612
I love you.

852
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:39,841
Now do up your coat. It's cold.

853
00:58:45,121 --> 00:58:47,155
Mom, we're not
gonna make it in time.

854
00:58:47,223 --> 00:58:49,357
What do you mean? Sit down.

855
00:58:52,162 --> 00:58:53,706
I mean we're not gonna make
enough wood by the deadline.

856
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:55,497
We need help.

857
00:58:55,566 --> 00:58:58,533
Well, I'm sure Pastor
Clark will understand.

858
00:58:58,602 --> 00:58:59,880
We could do it if we had help.

859
00:58:59,904 --> 00:59:01,836
Okay, but who?

860
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:05,240
Your father's not gonna help.

861
00:59:05,309 --> 00:59:07,275
Well, you could help us. Me?

862
00:59:07,344 --> 00:59:08,810
Yeah, you, Mom.

863
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:12,414
[Laughs] Oh,
Matty, don't be silly.

864
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:16,184
I don't know anything
about woodcarving.

865
00:59:16,253 --> 00:59:18,553
Well, neither did I. But
Mr. Otto is a great teacher.

866
00:59:18,622 --> 00:59:19,902
He could teach you.

867
00:59:21,024 --> 00:59:22,824
I... I've just
started a new job.

868
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:25,560
I... I can't go to
work in a lumberyard.

869
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:29,497
You mean you won't.

870
00:59:31,467 --> 00:59:32,567
Matty...

871
00:59:33,937 --> 00:59:35,369
I got bills to pay...

872
00:59:36,707 --> 00:59:39,140
responsibilities,
commitments. I'm sorry.

873
00:59:39,209 --> 00:59:40,809
I know that's not
what you want to hear

874
00:59:40,878 --> 00:59:42,343
but that's the way life is.

875
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:44,179
You're gonna have to...

876
00:59:44,248 --> 00:59:46,914
tell Mr. Otto to
find someone else.

877
00:59:51,188 --> 00:59:53,054
Mr. Otto wasn't asking, Mom.

878
00:59:54,358 --> 00:59:55,690
I was.

879
00:59:58,028 --> 01:00:01,095
Matthew, you're asking
me for something I can't give.

880
01:00:01,164 --> 01:00:02,975
Can I ask you
something else then?

881
01:00:02,999 --> 01:00:04,866
Sure.

882
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:06,268
WWJD?

883
01:00:08,172 --> 01:00:09,737
WWJD?

884
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:12,174
What would Jesus do?

885
01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:15,730
Mr. Otto taught it to me.

886
01:00:16,547 --> 01:00:18,413
That question doesn't
work for everything.

887
01:00:18,482 --> 01:00:20,815
Why not? Because!

888
01:00:20,884 --> 01:00:23,485
You're asking me
to go to my new boss

889
01:00:23,554 --> 01:00:24,886
and tell him I
can't start my job

890
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:28,290
because I'm going to carve
wood for Ernest Otto. It's...

891
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:32,260
Okay. Okay.

892
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:39,500
[Sighs] Great.

893
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:45,051
You really think
we can pull this off?

894
01:00:45,075 --> 01:00:47,175
Oh, never underestimate
the power of belief

895
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:48,877
combined with hard work.

896
01:00:48,946 --> 01:00:51,424
Well, let's ask the Lord
for, say, ten more guys.

897
01:00:51,448 --> 01:00:53,548
Well, why don't
you ask him for 20?

898
01:00:53,617 --> 01:00:55,537
I was only kidding. So was I.

899
01:00:55,586 --> 01:00:57,452
[Car horn]

900
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,287
Hey, it's your mom.

901
01:01:04,962 --> 01:01:06,895
Hi. Hi!

902
01:01:11,367 --> 01:01:15,169
I, uh, spoke to my new boss.

903
01:01:15,238 --> 01:01:18,272
Told him I wouldn't be able
to start work until next week.

904
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:19,518
He let you?

905
01:01:19,542 --> 01:01:21,576
No. I was fired.

906
01:01:21,645 --> 01:01:23,945
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

907
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:27,550
Do you need help?

908
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:33,488
Well, Matthew, come on.
Show your mom what to do.

909
01:01:33,557 --> 01:01:34,989
Come on, Mom.

910
01:01:36,726 --> 01:01:37,926
Thanks.

911
01:01:39,996 --> 01:01:41,129
Matthew.

912
01:01:44,434 --> 01:01:46,701
Grab the other end,
Mom. Okay, okay. Yep.

913
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:48,904
[Murmurs] [Chuckles]

914
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:58,039
Well, looks good, smells good...

915
01:02:58,108 --> 01:03:01,176
and... could use a
little bit more pepper.

916
01:03:01,244 --> 01:03:03,644
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no. No more pepper.

917
01:03:03,714 --> 01:03:05,013
What do you mean,
no more pepper?

918
01:03:05,082 --> 01:03:07,782
Do you have any idea how
many times I've made that?

919
01:03:07,851 --> 01:03:09,996
I guarantee you,
it needs more salt.

920
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:11,819
No. No... Aw!

921
01:03:13,423 --> 01:03:16,791
Try that. Let me see
how you ruined it now.

922
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:19,160
Oh, okay. Yeah,
all right, all right.

923
01:03:19,229 --> 01:03:20,562
I'm gonna have to show you

924
01:03:20,631 --> 01:03:22,563
how to make my chicken
noodle soup soon then.

925
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:25,800
Yeah, maybe tomorrow.
All right. All right.

926
01:03:25,869 --> 01:03:27,936
Hey. Hey-ho.

927
01:03:28,005 --> 01:03:30,505
So, what can I
do? Set the table?

928
01:03:30,574 --> 01:03:32,206
Sure. Um...

929
01:03:32,275 --> 01:03:34,876
Silverware's in that drawer
right next to the dishwasher.

930
01:03:34,945 --> 01:03:36,322
Okay. Thank you.

931
01:03:36,346 --> 01:03:38,346
Yup.

932
01:03:38,415 --> 01:03:40,935
Did you and your son
ever cook together?

933
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:46,320
Well, no, not really.

934
01:03:48,792 --> 01:03:50,425
[Bells jingling]

935
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:52,427
Well, now, who could that be?

936
01:04:01,771 --> 01:04:04,805
Hey, Ernest. Hey.
What can I do for you?

937
01:04:04,875 --> 01:04:07,575
I just came by to talk to
you about your contract.

938
01:04:07,644 --> 01:04:10,378
Oh, uh, I got the extension? No.

939
01:04:10,447 --> 01:04:12,091
I asked my boss but
he wouldn't budge.

940
01:04:12,115 --> 01:04:13,560
But he's still willing
to buy you out,

941
01:04:13,584 --> 01:04:15,216
so you won't lose any money.

942
01:04:15,285 --> 01:04:18,853
Well, thanks for the
effort. No problem.

943
01:04:18,922 --> 01:04:21,589
Actually, we're just about to
sit down and have some dinner.

944
01:04:21,658 --> 01:04:23,769
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't
realize it was dinnertime.

945
01:04:23,793 --> 01:04:26,527
No, no, I mean, are you
hungry? You wanna join us?

946
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:28,607
I don't wanna impose.

947
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:30,398
Ah, come on. No imposition.

948
01:04:30,467 --> 01:04:31,799
We've got plenty.

949
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:34,069
Follow me. Thanks.

950
01:04:34,137 --> 01:04:36,438
I'll ask Rita to throw
on another plate.

951
01:04:37,741 --> 01:04:38,806
Rita?

952
01:04:41,844 --> 01:04:43,656
Rita, would you set
an extra place, please?

953
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:44,757
Sure.

954
01:04:44,781 --> 01:04:46,559
Jack stopped by to
talk about the contract,

955
01:04:46,583 --> 01:04:47,748
but I'm starving

956
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:49,917
so I thought we'd
have dinner first.

957
01:04:51,421 --> 01:04:52,988
I'll get it, Mom.

958
01:04:53,056 --> 01:04:54,056
Okay.

959
01:04:55,259 --> 01:04:57,292
Something sure smells
good. [Claps hands]

960
01:04:59,296 --> 01:05:01,229
I'll set you a place.

961
01:05:03,266 --> 01:05:04,332
Sure.

962
01:05:07,037 --> 01:05:08,982
Ernest, what's my
dad doing here?

963
01:05:09,006 --> 01:05:11,539
Well, never underestimate
the power of prayer.

964
01:05:14,878 --> 01:05:16,610
What? I was a volunteer!

965
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:20,414
I did bake sales, I was
a camp counselor and...

966
01:05:20,483 --> 01:05:22,528
then I joined the choir.
You were in a choir?

967
01:05:22,552 --> 01:05:25,186
Mm-hm. That's how
Jack and I met, actually,

968
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:26,620
in the church choir.

969
01:05:28,158 --> 01:05:29,824
You were in a choir?

970
01:05:29,893 --> 01:05:31,226
I can't picture you singing.

971
01:05:31,294 --> 01:05:32,960
I can't.

972
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:34,995
I only joined to meet Rita.

973
01:05:35,064 --> 01:05:37,532
Then they figured
out I couldn't sing.

974
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,880
Did they kick you out, Dad?

975
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:43,337
Sort of. They asked me
if I wanted to be an usher.

976
01:05:43,406 --> 01:05:45,073
That was okay though,

977
01:05:45,141 --> 01:05:47,942
because by then I had
already met my wife.

978
01:05:48,011 --> 01:05:50,790
Well, you were very good at helping
the little old ladies to their seat.

979
01:05:50,814 --> 01:05:53,214
Hey, that was a
very important job.

980
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:55,583
Oh. [Chuckles]

981
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:58,420
Very cute old ladies.

982
01:06:05,696 --> 01:06:06,994
RITA: Here you go.

983
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:10,198
Thank you.

984
01:06:13,336 --> 01:06:14,535
[Coughs]

985
01:06:18,241 --> 01:06:21,142
We haven't had dinner
together in a long time.

986
01:06:21,211 --> 01:06:22,309
Yeah.

987
01:06:23,747 --> 01:06:25,713
Those two can cook.

988
01:06:25,782 --> 01:06:28,302
Yeah, they work well together.

989
01:06:28,518 --> 01:06:31,019
Yeah, they do.

990
01:06:31,087 --> 01:06:32,453
Rita...

991
01:06:32,522 --> 01:06:36,124
you do realize that if Ernie
delivers the wood on time,

992
01:06:36,192 --> 01:06:37,592
I lose a partnership.

993
01:06:37,661 --> 01:06:41,396
Jack, some things you do
because it's the right thing.

994
01:06:44,434 --> 01:06:46,367
Like help Ernie cut wood?

995
01:06:50,974 --> 01:06:52,218
You know about that.

996
01:06:52,242 --> 01:06:53,841
Matthew told me.

997
01:06:53,910 --> 01:06:55,309
Oh.

998
01:06:58,114 --> 01:06:59,213
[Sighs]

999
01:07:04,621 --> 01:07:06,253
How's your coffee?

1000
01:07:06,322 --> 01:07:08,656
It's good.

1001
01:07:08,725 --> 01:07:10,024
Well, Matthew made it.

1002
01:07:11,728 --> 01:07:13,961
Our son made coffee? Mm-hm.

1003
01:07:14,997 --> 01:07:16,330
[Both chuckle]

1004
01:07:24,173 --> 01:07:25,640
Jack, what happened to us?

1005
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:27,241
I dunno.

1006
01:07:29,912 --> 01:07:31,345
We drifted apart.

1007
01:07:34,517 --> 01:07:36,284
Everything made sense before.

1008
01:07:37,787 --> 01:07:40,321
By "before" do you mean when
we stopped following the Lord,

1009
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:43,158
turning our family over to him?

1010
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:46,628
[Sighs] Rita, I... I don't want
to talk about this right now.

1011
01:07:46,696 --> 01:07:49,136
Jack, you never want
to talk about anything.

1012
01:07:52,635 --> 01:07:55,170
I'm just saying, I think our
marital problems started

1013
01:07:55,238 --> 01:07:57,798
when we walked away from God.

1014
01:07:58,341 --> 01:08:00,608
Saved by the bell. Hey, buddy!

1015
01:08:02,612 --> 01:08:05,379
Hey. You guys aren't
fighting again, are you?

1016
01:08:05,449 --> 01:08:07,348
No.

1017
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:08,928
No. We're... Talking.

1018
01:08:08,952 --> 01:08:11,486
We're just talking.

1019
01:08:11,555 --> 01:08:12,787
Sit down.

1020
01:08:15,392 --> 01:08:16,672
What's going on?

1021
01:08:19,028 --> 01:08:21,028
I have a question, Dad.

1022
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:22,397
Ask away.

1023
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:26,067
You know we had
a fire here, right?

1024
01:08:26,135 --> 01:08:27,402
Yeah, I heard.

1025
01:08:29,706 --> 01:08:31,205
What is it, son?

1026
01:08:34,911 --> 01:08:36,310
Just wondering...

1027
01:08:39,749 --> 01:08:41,382
do you know anything about that?

1028
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:45,954
What do you mean, son?

1029
01:08:47,056 --> 01:08:48,356
I mean...

1030
01:08:51,227 --> 01:08:52,626
do you know who
started the fire?

1031
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:56,231
[Sighs]

1032
01:08:58,834 --> 01:09:00,794
Why would I know about that?

1033
01:09:03,306 --> 01:09:06,785
Matthew, your father would never
be a part of something like that.

1034
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:09,143
Oh my God, Matt.

1035
01:09:11,847 --> 01:09:13,347
Of course not.

1036
01:09:16,186 --> 01:09:18,118
I love you, Matty.

1037
01:09:19,389 --> 01:09:20,788
You gotta know that.

1038
01:09:20,856 --> 01:09:23,056
I'd never do
anything to hurt you.

1039
01:09:25,628 --> 01:09:26,727
Okay.

1040
01:09:27,697 --> 01:09:29,630
Do you understand?

1041
01:09:39,909 --> 01:09:41,442
I love you.

1042
01:09:44,247 --> 01:09:46,147
MATTHEW: I love you too, Dad.

1043
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:11,651
ERNEST: Yeah, that was a pretty
good day's work, don't you think?

1044
01:10:11,675 --> 01:10:13,274
MATTHEW: Yeah.

1045
01:10:13,342 --> 01:10:16,110
How long do you think
it's gonna take us to finish?

1046
01:10:16,179 --> 01:10:18,379
Um, about a week.

1047
01:10:18,447 --> 01:10:20,247
My hearing's pretty soon.

1048
01:10:20,316 --> 01:10:22,249
Oh, yeah, yeah, school, huh?

1049
01:10:22,318 --> 01:10:24,251
What are you gonna tell 'em?

1050
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,988
That I wanna go back to school.

1051
01:10:27,057 --> 01:10:28,389
That's it?

1052
01:10:30,526 --> 01:10:34,195
You're gonna have to give them
something more than that, don't you think?

1053
01:10:34,263 --> 01:10:35,730
Like what?

1054
01:10:35,799 --> 01:10:38,299
Well, are you remorseful?

1055
01:10:40,103 --> 01:10:42,369
Okay. Well, tell them that.

1056
01:10:42,438 --> 01:10:44,438
Have you changed?

1057
01:10:44,507 --> 01:10:46,085
Yeah. Well, there you go again.

1058
01:10:46,109 --> 01:10:49,421
You can tell them you're
remorseful, that you've changed.

1059
01:10:49,445 --> 01:10:51,512
Like, I wanna do
what Jesus would do.

1060
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:55,183
You know, get educated,
make my family proud.

1061
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:59,386
Yeah, yeah. What about
wanting to do it for yourself?

1062
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:04,859
I wish you could
be there with me.

1063
01:11:04,928 --> 01:11:06,627
Well...

1064
01:11:06,696 --> 01:11:09,831
you're gonna have to handle
this one on your own, kid.

1065
01:11:15,505 --> 01:11:16,571
Yeah.

1066
01:11:22,979 --> 01:11:26,280
You wanna come
back to school, Matthew.

1067
01:11:26,349 --> 01:11:27,581
Why?

1068
01:11:28,952 --> 01:11:31,432
Because it's the
right thing to do.

1069
01:11:32,022 --> 01:11:35,857
I'm looking for a change
in your behavior, Matthew.

1070
01:11:35,925 --> 01:11:38,526
Uh, quite frankly,
I haven't seen any.

1071
01:11:38,594 --> 01:11:40,328
[School bell ringing]

1072
01:11:40,397 --> 01:11:41,829
Writing graffiti,

1073
01:11:41,898 --> 01:11:44,458
breaking windows
at the church...

1074
01:11:45,067 --> 01:11:47,501
I just don't think you've
earned the right to come back.

1075
01:11:48,571 --> 01:11:49,903
[Whispers] WWJD?

1076
01:11:51,341 --> 01:11:52,807
What did you just
say, young man?

1077
01:11:52,876 --> 01:11:55,609
I said, WWJD.

1078
01:11:57,513 --> 01:11:59,525
It stands for: "What
would Jesus do?"

1079
01:11:59,549 --> 01:12:01,794
Yeah, I know what it stands for.

1080
01:12:01,818 --> 01:12:03,985
What does it have
to do with you?

1081
01:12:04,053 --> 01:12:06,820
Well, it's something
that Mr. Otto taught me.

1082
01:12:06,890 --> 01:12:09,990
It's what I ask myself now
before I make a decision.

1083
01:12:10,059 --> 01:12:12,659
Mr. Otto? Oh, you
mean Ernest Otto?

1084
01:12:12,729 --> 01:12:14,595
Yes, sir.

1085
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:17,732
Matthew's been living with
Ernest Otto for the past few weeks.

1086
01:12:17,801 --> 01:12:20,535
He's been helping him carve
wood for the Sunday school.

1087
01:12:20,603 --> 01:12:23,571
Well, Ernest is a good man.

1088
01:12:25,141 --> 01:12:27,008
But I'm not
impressed with the fact

1089
01:12:27,076 --> 01:12:30,378
he had to help fix the
windows he vandalized.

1090
01:12:31,915 --> 01:12:33,514
He wanted to help.

1091
01:12:33,583 --> 01:12:35,961
I gave him a chance
to quit. He didn't.

1092
01:12:35,985 --> 01:12:37,785
And we are both
very proud of our son.

1093
01:12:39,522 --> 01:12:41,455
Mr. and Mrs. Stevenson...

1094
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:46,360
I think it's very positive that
you're both here for your son.

1095
01:12:46,429 --> 01:12:50,298
But I have a whole school
full of children to think about.

1096
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:53,433
What kind of a... a message
would I be sending to...

1097
01:12:56,338 --> 01:12:58,439
Sorry to barge in on you all.

1098
01:12:58,508 --> 01:13:00,875
Uh, Mr. Otto.

1099
01:13:00,944 --> 01:13:02,777
Uh, please, come in.

1100
01:13:02,845 --> 01:13:05,045
I was... I was hoping
I could say something.

1101
01:13:06,616 --> 01:13:09,784
Um... Well, go ahead.

1102
01:13:09,853 --> 01:13:14,254
I understand that Matthew...
has been living with you.

1103
01:13:14,323 --> 01:13:18,726
Well, yeah, he has. He's also been
helping me carve wood for the church.

1104
01:13:18,795 --> 01:13:21,461
Is it not true, Mr. Otto,

1105
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:23,876
that Matthew is helping
to repair the church

1106
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:26,968
as a condition imposed
on him by Pastor Clark?

1107
01:13:27,036 --> 01:13:29,170
Oh, yeah, I'm sure that's
the way it was at first.

1108
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:32,873
But I began to see a
real change in Matthew.

1109
01:13:32,942 --> 01:13:36,310
I think he just needed some time
away from home to think things through.

1110
01:13:36,378 --> 01:13:39,146
And this report says that
Matthew ran away from home.

1111
01:13:39,215 --> 01:13:42,817
So, on top of everything,
he's a runaway.

1112
01:13:42,885 --> 01:13:47,387
No, we let Matthew
stay with Mr. Otto.

1113
01:13:47,457 --> 01:13:49,690
A decision as
incredibly important

1114
01:13:49,759 --> 01:13:51,603
as not letting him
back into high school

1115
01:13:51,627 --> 01:13:53,472
requires a lot of
time and reflection

1116
01:13:53,496 --> 01:13:55,295
on behalf of the decision-maker.

1117
01:13:57,033 --> 01:13:58,232
I concur.

1118
01:14:00,136 --> 01:14:03,504
And I have given this
a great deal of thought.

1119
01:14:05,408 --> 01:14:08,876
It is with a heavy heart
that I make this decision.

1120
01:14:08,945 --> 01:14:11,478
Matthew... ERNEST:
I recall a young

1121
01:14:11,547 --> 01:14:13,580
high-school guy that once...

1122
01:14:13,650 --> 01:14:16,884
left the water running on
purpose in the boys' room.

1123
01:14:18,554 --> 01:14:21,289
Flooded the whole second
floor, if I remember correctly.

1124
01:14:21,357 --> 01:14:23,357
It even leaked
down to the first floor.

1125
01:14:23,425 --> 01:14:25,526
It cost the school
thousands of dollars.

1126
01:14:25,595 --> 01:14:27,339
I don't know what
that has to do with this.

1127
01:14:27,363 --> 01:14:29,764
The principal at the time
was a Mr. Theodore Foley.

1128
01:14:29,832 --> 01:14:31,165
That's my wife's father.

1129
01:14:31,233 --> 01:14:33,533
We're talking about
Matthew this afternoon.

1130
01:14:33,603 --> 01:14:36,136
That boy got a second chance.

1131
01:14:36,206 --> 01:14:37,949
And because of
that chance, that...

1132
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:41,275
that young man went on to
really make something of himself.

1133
01:14:44,947 --> 01:14:47,228
Went on to become
principal of the school.

1134
01:14:56,125 --> 01:14:57,925
So, Tom...

1135
01:14:57,993 --> 01:15:01,228
don't you think Matthew
deserves the same chance you got?

1136
01:15:05,267 --> 01:15:06,267
Mr. Stark?

1137
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:20,300
MAN: Stack 'em up,
guys, stack 'em up!

1138
01:15:21,817 --> 01:15:24,985
JERRY: If he is late, and I
don't care if it's by five minutes,

1139
01:15:25,054 --> 01:15:26,720
we go ahead with our wood.

1140
01:15:28,024 --> 01:15:30,290
Jack, you listening?

1141
01:15:31,961 --> 01:15:34,495
Jack. Yeah.

1142
01:15:34,563 --> 01:15:36,174
The Pastor will see the
Sunday school going up,

1143
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:39,266
everything will be on
schedule, he'll be happy.

1144
01:15:41,436 --> 01:15:43,637
Hey, what is the
matter with you today?

1145
01:15:44,841 --> 01:15:46,121
I gotta take a few days off.

1146
01:15:46,175 --> 01:15:47,808
[Chuckles] Are you nuts?

1147
01:15:49,379 --> 01:15:50,379
Not anymore.

1148
01:15:51,814 --> 01:15:53,992
Some things are more
important than this job.

1149
01:15:54,016 --> 01:15:55,849
What on earth could
be more important

1150
01:15:55,919 --> 01:15:57,351
than this job right now?

1151
01:15:57,420 --> 01:15:58,585
My family.

1152
01:15:58,654 --> 01:16:00,620
My wife. My son.

1153
01:16:00,689 --> 01:16:03,958
Your family? I thought
you were getting divorced.

1154
01:16:04,026 --> 01:16:05,726
Not if I can help it.

1155
01:16:05,795 --> 01:16:07,161
So you're just walking away?

1156
01:16:09,699 --> 01:16:11,164
Looks that way.

1157
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:15,202
Do you realize how many
people would love to be

1158
01:16:15,271 --> 01:16:17,337
in your shoes right now?

1159
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:21,007
I am offering you a 50%
ownership in this company.

1160
01:16:23,879 --> 01:16:26,157
I appreciate your offer,
and the opportunity.

1161
01:16:26,181 --> 01:16:27,347
I really do.

1162
01:16:28,684 --> 01:16:31,151
But the Lord has a plan for me.

1163
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:32,586
My family needs me.

1164
01:16:32,655 --> 01:16:35,890
And if that means losing
this partnership, so be it.

1165
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:40,361
Well, this partnership
just went up in flames.

1166
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:42,462
Just like Otto's wood.

1167
01:16:42,531 --> 01:16:44,131
What did you just say?

1168
01:16:49,071 --> 01:16:50,571
See these edges here?

1169
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:54,508
You gotta sand them to
the round, so it sheds water.

1170
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:00,448
Did you teach
your son this stuff?

1171
01:17:00,516 --> 01:17:01,816
Oh, yeah.

1172
01:17:04,854 --> 01:17:07,087
Did Josh ever wanna
run away from home?

1173
01:17:09,859 --> 01:17:11,525
Yeah, he did.

1174
01:17:12,895 --> 01:17:14,962
Yes. Like me, huh?

1175
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:18,766
Yeah.

1176
01:17:18,835 --> 01:17:21,195
A few months before he died...

1177
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:23,915
[Sighs] ...we just
couldn't get along.

1178
01:17:23,939 --> 01:17:26,574
So, uh, you know,
he knew everything,

1179
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:28,041
I knew everything.

1180
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:30,378
All we did was argue, and...

1181
01:17:30,446 --> 01:17:32,312
yeah, yeah, he ran away.

1182
01:17:34,584 --> 01:17:35,949
Where did he go?

1183
01:17:37,787 --> 01:17:39,253
Joined the army.

1184
01:17:40,757 --> 01:17:42,723
Less than a year later, he died.

1185
01:17:48,130 --> 01:17:49,629
Biggest mistake I ever made,

1186
01:17:49,698 --> 01:17:51,938
letting him run away like that.

1187
01:17:53,302 --> 01:17:55,903
I never got to say goodbye,

1188
01:17:55,971 --> 01:17:57,905
never got to say I'm sorry.

1189
01:17:59,475 --> 01:18:01,995
I wasn't there when
he needed me most.

1190
01:18:03,746 --> 01:18:05,679
At least you know he needed you.

1191
01:18:05,748 --> 01:18:10,284
Yeah. Yeah, well...

1192
01:18:10,353 --> 01:18:12,286
all sons need their father.

1193
01:18:12,355 --> 01:18:15,623
And all fathers...
need their sons.

1194
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:21,395
I never forgave myself and...

1195
01:18:21,464 --> 01:18:23,197
I'm pretty sure I never will.

1196
01:19:01,704 --> 01:19:03,003
[Saw buzzes]

1197
01:19:03,072 --> 01:19:04,504
[Hammering]

1198
01:19:18,654 --> 01:19:20,521
Very nice. Very nice job.

1199
01:19:27,663 --> 01:19:29,997
Looks great! Thanks.

1200
01:19:30,066 --> 01:19:32,377
So, how much longer
till the sun comes up?

1201
01:19:32,401 --> 01:19:34,768
Oh, it's only, what,
2:30 in the morning?

1202
01:19:34,837 --> 01:19:36,904
Lots of time. You
want some coffee?

1203
01:19:36,973 --> 01:19:38,339
Ah, I'm good.

1204
01:19:39,342 --> 01:19:41,274
Hey. [Hammering]

1205
01:19:48,117 --> 01:19:52,352
I don't remember seeing him being
so committed to something before.

1206
01:19:52,421 --> 01:19:53,587
Yeah.

1207
01:19:53,656 --> 01:19:55,156
[Hammering continues]

1208
01:19:58,895 --> 01:20:00,327
ERNEST: Argh! Oh!

1209
01:20:00,396 --> 01:20:01,828
Dad! What happened?

1210
01:20:02,999 --> 01:20:05,032
It just slipped. ERNEST: Argh!

1211
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:07,634
The chisel just
slipped! [Ernest groans]

1212
01:20:07,703 --> 01:20:10,023
ERNEST: [Strained]
I'm okay. It'll be fine.

1213
01:20:12,441 --> 01:20:13,618
[Squelching] [Groans]

1214
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:15,875
JACK: It's okay. He's all right.

1215
01:20:15,945 --> 01:20:17,644
It's okay.

1216
01:20:17,713 --> 01:20:19,458
I really think we need
to get you to the hospital.

1217
01:20:19,482 --> 01:20:21,459
Oh, it's all right. It's okay.

1218
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:24,418
It's not the first time I've
stuck myself with a chisel.

1219
01:20:24,487 --> 01:20:26,119
I... I think she's
right, Ernest.

1220
01:20:26,189 --> 01:20:27,429
We gotta get you to a hospital.

1221
01:20:27,456 --> 01:20:29,701
Oh, no. It didn't hit
an artery or a tendon.

1222
01:20:29,725 --> 01:20:31,603
I'll... I'll survive.

1223
01:20:31,627 --> 01:20:33,894
Ernest, please. I'm good.

1224
01:20:33,963 --> 01:20:36,483
I'm good. Go back
to work, will you?

1225
01:20:37,166 --> 01:20:39,833
I'll be fine! It's... You okay?

1226
01:20:41,771 --> 01:20:43,481
I'm sorry. I'm good. I'm good.

1227
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:44,905
Yeah, it's all right, Matt.

1228
01:20:47,743 --> 01:20:49,509
Ernest... Ernest, I'm sorry.

1229
01:20:49,579 --> 01:20:51,779
Just grab that
first-aid kit, will ya?

1230
01:20:53,415 --> 01:20:54,648
Come on.

1231
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,220
[Birdsong]

1232
01:21:00,289 --> 01:21:01,388
[Sanding]

1233
01:21:16,805 --> 01:21:18,972
Well, that's all the
carving I'm gonna do.

1234
01:21:20,576 --> 01:21:22,075
Let's close it up.

1235
01:21:26,415 --> 01:21:28,849
We can keep
working while you rest.

1236
01:21:31,687 --> 01:21:33,286
Much obliged.

1237
01:21:33,355 --> 01:21:36,290
Yeah, Ernie, go get
some rest and, uh...

1238
01:21:36,358 --> 01:21:38,692
we'll keep rolling here.

1239
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:40,627
I know you will.

1240
01:21:40,696 --> 01:21:42,095
It's ready to go.

1241
01:21:44,533 --> 01:21:45,677
Dad, come on, help me with this.

1242
01:21:45,701 --> 01:21:47,835
Uh, okay.

1243
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:49,269
One sec.

1244
01:21:49,338 --> 01:21:50,637
What are we doing?

1245
01:21:52,208 --> 01:21:54,653
You gotta pull this around and
hook it up to the block, okay?

1246
01:21:54,677 --> 01:21:55,942
All right.

1247
01:21:56,011 --> 01:21:57,789
Like this? Yeah, but pull tight.

1248
01:21:57,813 --> 01:22:00,146
Pull this down, I guess,
yeah? Yep. Pick it up.

1249
01:22:00,216 --> 01:22:02,227
All right. And then what?

1250
01:22:02,251 --> 01:22:03,950
MATTHEW: Pull up.

1251
01:22:04,019 --> 01:22:06,364
JACK: I'm too old for this,
Matty. You can do this?

1252
01:22:06,388 --> 01:22:08,521
Yeah. Move. All right,
there we go, buddy.

1253
01:22:10,226 --> 01:22:14,261
You gotta watch it. Watch it!
[Laughs] All right. Go. Lift it.

1254
01:22:14,330 --> 01:22:16,529
[Chuckles]

1255
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:18,966
I guess my son just,
uh, showed me up.

1256
01:22:19,034 --> 01:22:20,779
Yes, I think he did. Good job!

1257
01:22:20,803 --> 01:22:22,948
JACK: Huh? You seeing
this? RITA: Yeah. [Chuckles]

1258
01:22:22,972 --> 01:22:24,204
He's Ernie now.

1259
01:22:24,273 --> 01:22:25,284
[Laughs]

1260
01:22:25,308 --> 01:22:27,708
JACK: All right,
Ernest. No problem.

1261
01:22:27,777 --> 01:22:29,876
JACK: There we go. Good job.

1262
01:22:35,717 --> 01:22:39,153
What they did... is they loaded
everything backwards, all right?

1263
01:22:39,221 --> 01:22:41,502
So we need to get this
flipped over here so we can...

1264
01:22:44,359 --> 01:22:46,793
Well, this is the, uh,
prefabricated wood, is it?

1265
01:22:46,862 --> 01:22:48,302
That's right. Yes, sir it is.

1266
01:22:48,364 --> 01:22:52,065
And, uh, we're just
about out of time, so...

1267
01:22:52,133 --> 01:22:54,446
Well, I guess you have
to do what you have to do.

1268
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:56,903
Yes, I guess we do,
yeah. I think you're gonna

1269
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:59,292
be pleased with
the price. [Car horn]

1270
01:23:04,046 --> 01:23:05,245
Ah...

1271
01:23:12,521 --> 01:23:13,954
RITA: Good luck.

1272
01:23:16,358 --> 01:23:17,638
[Siren blast]

1273
01:23:20,529 --> 01:23:23,063
PASTOR: Pleasure to see
you guys. ERNEST: Pastor.

1274
01:23:23,132 --> 01:23:24,675
PASTOR: Ernest, what
happened with your leg?

1275
01:23:24,699 --> 01:23:27,534
ERNEST: Oh, occupational hazard.

1276
01:23:27,603 --> 01:23:30,537
I wanna show you something.
[Police radio chatter]

1277
01:23:32,307 --> 01:23:33,685
I carved this out
of myrtle wood.

1278
01:23:33,709 --> 01:23:36,876
Just like the one I carved
for you about 40 years ago.

1279
01:23:36,945 --> 01:23:38,690
Oh, amen to that, Ernest.
WOMAN: Jerry Sandstone,

1280
01:23:38,714 --> 01:23:39,958
you're gonna have
to come with us.

1281
01:23:39,982 --> 01:23:43,016
Hey, hey, hey! I want a lawyer.

1282
01:24:01,937 --> 01:24:04,838
Jerry's the one who
started the fire at your shop.

1283
01:24:04,906 --> 01:24:06,840
He wanted to sign a deal
with a prefab company

1284
01:24:06,908 --> 01:24:10,377
that was offering him larger
contracts and more money.

1285
01:24:10,446 --> 01:24:11,923
Well, how did the
police find out?

1286
01:24:11,947 --> 01:24:14,480
He admitted it. I turned him in.

1287
01:24:15,784 --> 01:24:17,384
Dad, you called the police?

1288
01:24:17,453 --> 01:24:19,052
Yes, son, I did.

1289
01:24:19,121 --> 01:24:22,389
But if Mr. Sandstone goes
to jail, you won't have a job.

1290
01:24:22,458 --> 01:24:26,326
I've got some work coming
up. I can, uh, use some help.

1291
01:24:26,395 --> 01:24:28,162
I'd be honored.

1292
01:24:29,365 --> 01:24:30,897
Welcome aboard.

1293
01:24:30,966 --> 01:24:33,066
Well, I do need someone
to finish the Sunday school.

1294
01:24:33,135 --> 01:24:34,268
Are you both available?

1295
01:24:35,604 --> 01:24:36,970
Just finished a job. Ernie?

1296
01:24:37,039 --> 01:24:39,084
Yeah, my schedule
happens to be clear.

1297
01:24:39,108 --> 01:24:41,108
[Chuckles] Good.

1298
01:24:43,044 --> 01:24:45,478
Mrs. Stevenson, thank you.

1299
01:24:45,547 --> 01:24:47,247
Thank you. Hm!

1300
01:24:54,890 --> 01:24:57,223
ERNEST: I'm happy for you two.

1301
01:24:57,293 --> 01:24:59,058
You belong together.

1302
01:25:01,864 --> 01:25:05,198
I've got some work
to do. ERNEST: Yeah.

1303
01:25:05,267 --> 01:25:09,402
Christine and I worked
it... 40 years. It'll be okay.

1304
01:25:09,471 --> 01:25:12,072
Well, I know exactly
where this goes, but, uh...

1305
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:14,007
I'm gonna need some help, Jack.

1306
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:16,877
Sure. Honey?

1307
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:24,417
Love you. Love you, Mom.

1308
01:25:27,689 --> 01:25:29,256
Thank you, Ernest.

1309
01:25:29,324 --> 01:25:30,724
Matthew.

1310
01:25:33,762 --> 01:25:35,729
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1311
01:25:35,798 --> 01:25:37,809
I'd like to come by and
visit, if that's all right?

1312
01:25:37,833 --> 01:25:40,633
I look forward to it.

1313
01:25:40,702 --> 01:25:42,335
And, uh...

1314
01:25:42,404 --> 01:25:43,703
when you do...

1315
01:25:45,173 --> 01:25:47,474
I'll show you how this works.

1316
01:25:58,119 --> 01:25:59,319
Thank you.

1317
01:26:01,657 --> 01:26:02,955
Thank you.

1318
01:26:05,894 --> 01:26:07,226
[Car door opens]

1319
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:30,183
Good morning.

1320
01:26:31,453 --> 01:26:33,286
I got you some irises.

1321
01:26:44,333 --> 01:26:46,265
It's gonna be a beautiful day.

1322
01:26:48,337 --> 01:26:49,436
Ah!

1323
01:26:51,272 --> 01:26:54,307
Turns out that you were right.

1324
01:26:54,376 --> 01:26:56,142
I'm not done workin'.

1325
01:26:57,613 --> 01:27:00,780
It seems there's plenty of
people would still like a...

1326
01:27:00,849 --> 01:27:02,448
woodcarver around.

1327
01:27:05,754 --> 01:27:08,354
Should have known
you'd be right about that.

1328
01:27:18,166 --> 01:27:20,834
I think I'll stick
around here for a bit.

1329
01:27:28,710 --> 01:27:30,911
You got a ladybug
on your tombstone.

1330
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:34,147
Means you're gonna be
coming into some money.

1331
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:50,997
I sure miss you.

1332
01:27:54,236 --> 01:27:56,169
I miss you so much.
