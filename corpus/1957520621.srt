[Operator] I'm sorry, can't copy you.

00:00:19,357 --> 00:00:20,190
Copy.

[police radio chatter]

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,408
[David] You know, it's
probably just some crackheads,

9
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,688
if I'm gonna be honest.

10
00:00:45,235 --> 00:00:46,448
[Giles] You're probably right.

11
00:00:47,285 --> 00:00:49,328
Either way, I'm wanna
get this one over with.

12
00:00:50,695 --> 00:00:52,095
[David] Police department.

13
00:01:00,335 --> 00:01:02,548
Police department, let yourself be known.

00:01:06,013 --> 00:01:07,923
[bell rings]

15
00:01:07,965 --> 00:01:08,798

[loud footsteps echo]

00:01:21,655 --> 00:01:22,635
Go, go, go.

18
00:01:24,595 --> 00:01:25,428
Watch that door.

[police radio chatter]

20
00:01:41,048 --> 00:01:43,588
[Giles] All right, I'm
gonna check down this hallway.

21
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:45,338
Circle back.

22
00:01:47,405 --> 00:01:48,405
[David] Copy that.

24
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,223

Police department, if
there's anyone in here,

28
00:02:18,575 --> 00:02:19,675
let yourself be known.

33
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,478
David, where are you?

[gentle piano music]

38
00:04:04,565 --> 00:04:07,658
I try and draw him as often as I can

39
00:04:09,395 --> 00:04:11,528
just to keep his head fresh in my mind.

40
00:04:15,395 --> 00:04:18,123
Pictures, all that,

41
00:04:18,165 --> 00:04:20,668
they're just, kinda, too
real for me right now.

42
00:04:22,985 --> 00:04:25,508
I wanna remember David as he actually was.

43
00:04:26,775 --> 00:04:28,945
I wanna remember David
when he was with me.

44
00:04:48,535 --> 00:04:53,535
It's hard losing somebody
so close to you overnight,

45
00:04:56,395 --> 00:04:58,188
especially without answers.

46
00:05:01,714 --> 00:05:05,928
They say that time heals all wounds.

47
00:05:07,575 --> 00:05:10,658
And that's bullshit, obviously.

48
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:18,393
But what time can do really is help you

49
00:05:18,435 --> 00:05:19,963
get a little bit better at pretending

50
00:05:20,005 --> 00:05:21,205
that you're whole again.

51
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:28,608
And that'll be fine, later.

52
00:05:31,225 --> 00:05:32,288
I need an answer.

53
00:05:33,995 --> 00:05:35,738
I need something I can hold on to.

54
00:05:38,465 --> 00:05:40,165
I need something that makes sense.

55
00:05:41,695 --> 00:05:45,868
After that, I will gladly move on.

56
00:05:49,885 --> 00:05:54,885
This is where David
disappeared, Yorktown Hospital.

57
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:02,628
Afterwards, I went back
there every day for a month,

58
00:06:03,965 --> 00:06:06,465
just trying to get a feel
for the place, you know?

59
00:06:08,245 --> 00:06:10,753
Just trying to figure out what happened.

60
00:06:10,795 --> 00:06:13,118
And I was the only one out there,

61
00:06:14,465 --> 00:06:16,188
except for the security guard.

62
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:20,285
David was last seen by his police partner

63
00:06:21,265 --> 00:06:23,923
who survived without a scratch

64
00:06:23,965 --> 00:06:26,178
and with zero memory of what happened.

65
00:06:27,465 --> 00:06:28,498
Inconvenient, right?

66
00:06:32,855 --> 00:06:35,018
I called the station
every day for a month.

67
00:06:37,065 --> 00:06:39,163
They didn't wanna talk to me.

68
00:06:39,205 --> 00:06:40,828
Nobody wants to talk to me.

69
00:06:43,398 --> 00:06:46,548
All I could find out was the
one thing left at the scene

70
00:06:47,725 --> 00:06:49,208
was his body cam.

71
00:06:50,475 --> 00:06:52,093
Footage is classified,

72
00:06:52,135 --> 00:06:56,018
but some genius leaked a
small portion of it online.

73
00:06:59,195 --> 00:07:04,195
Cuts off at the end, so no answers there.

74
00:07:06,445 --> 00:07:11,445
I think the point of this
really is to find truth,

75
00:07:14,115 --> 00:07:15,378
to find answers.

76
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:19,188
Somebody out there knows
what happened to David.

77
00:07:24,395 --> 00:07:26,333
Maybe if somebody sees this,

78
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:29,125
they'll realize that they
know something that can help.

79
00:07:33,325 --> 00:07:37,628
But more than that, I
want people to know David.

80
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:41,425
I don't wanna be the only one
who cares about him anymore.

81
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,373
I don't wanna be the only person

82
00:07:44,415 --> 00:07:45,965
who cares what happened to him.

83
00:07:50,575 --> 00:07:53,178
I want people to see and understand.

84
00:07:54,745 --> 00:07:59,683
I want people to know how
after years of service,

85
00:07:59,725 --> 00:08:02,248
the department just threw
him away like trash.

86
00:08:03,868 --> 00:08:06,868
[suspenseful music]

87
00:08:15,035 --> 00:08:18,963
Okay, this is the house of
one of David's supervisors.

88
00:08:19,005 --> 00:08:21,003
He was working when David went missing,

89
00:08:21,045 --> 00:08:23,218
and he resigned a month
after the incident.

90
00:08:24,325 --> 00:08:26,243
He never released any info

91
00:08:26,285 --> 00:08:28,008
or even attempted to talk with me.

92
00:08:41,245 --> 00:08:43,313
Whoa, whoa, whoa what
the hell's going on here?

93
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:44,223
What the hell is all this?

94
00:08:44,265 --> 00:08:46,513
I just have some
questions I'd like to ask.

95
00:08:46,555 --> 00:08:47,753
I want to know what happened.

96
00:08:47,795 --> 00:08:48,703
Get some therapy.

97
00:08:48,745 --> 00:08:50,393
Get a life like the rest of us.

98
00:08:50,435 --> 00:08:52,983
I need for both of y'all to
get the hell off my property.

99
00:08:53,025 --> 00:08:54,174
Why did you quit your job?

100
00:08:54,216 --> 00:08:55,216
Right now!

101
00:08:59,508 --> 00:09:01,425
Off to a great start.

102
00:09:03,275 --> 00:09:05,858
[mellow music]

103
00:09:16,565 --> 00:09:19,978
Okay, is the house of David's ex partner,

104
00:09:21,325 --> 00:09:23,703
last person to see him alive.

105
00:09:23,745 --> 00:09:26,913
He hasn't exactly been
super helpful in the past,

106
00:09:26,955 --> 00:09:28,858
but it's worth a shot.

107
00:09:45,495 --> 00:09:47,895
Giles, can you tell me
what happened that night?

108
00:09:49,195 --> 00:09:54,195
Yeah, there was a
disturbance call, the hospital.

109
00:09:56,265 --> 00:09:58,216
We went in and checked it out.

110
00:09:58,258 --> 00:09:59,878
It was nothing out of the ordinary.

111
00:10:01,796 --> 00:10:04,722
We heard something, so
we went a bit deeper.

112
00:10:07,605 --> 00:10:08,548
We split.

113
00:10:11,065 --> 00:10:13,098
You split up. Why?

114
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,785
I don't know.

115
00:10:15,827 --> 00:10:17,933
We wanted to see if there
was anyone back there.

116
00:10:17,975 --> 00:10:19,058
Was there anyone?

117
00:10:20,315 --> 00:10:21,148
Yeah.

118
00:10:24,345 --> 00:10:26,162
I don't know, it was just... a head.

119
00:10:32,324 --> 00:10:33,386
A head?

120
00:10:33,428 --> 00:10:34,923
Then he called on the radio.

121
00:10:34,965 --> 00:10:36,684
I ran for the church doors.

122
00:10:36,726 --> 00:10:38,673
Hey, hey, calm down.

123
00:10:38,715 --> 00:10:40,563
[Giles screams]

124
00:10:40,605 --> 00:10:41,951
Giles, whoa!

125
00:10:41,993 --> 00:10:43,436
[Giles mumbles prayers]

126
00:10:43,478 --> 00:10:45,352
Giles, Giles, Giles, we're going.

127
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,655
[Sarah screams]

128
00:10:47,697 --> 00:10:51,030
[Giles mumbles prayers]

129
00:11:07,809 --> 00:11:08,847
[phone ringing]

130
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:11,244
[Operator] 911, what's your emergency?

131
00:11:11,286 --> 00:11:15,422
[Woman] Hi, I was walking
by the old Yorktown Hospital

132
00:11:15,464 --> 00:11:18,183
and I heard this weird
screaming coming from inside.

133
00:11:18,225 --> 00:11:19,213
[Operator] Okay, ma'am.

134
00:11:19,255 --> 00:11:22,633
We're going to send a police
officer there very shortly.

135
00:11:22,675 --> 00:11:25,113
[Woman] There's already
a police car here.

136
00:11:25,155 --> 00:11:26,096
[Operator] There is?

137
00:11:26,138 --> 00:11:27,443
[Woman] Yes.

138
00:11:27,485 --> 00:11:30,683
Actually, we passed the
hospital on the way here.

139
00:11:30,725 --> 00:11:33,053
How long have you lived in the area?

140
00:11:33,095 --> 00:11:34,883
Well, I can tell you,

141
00:11:34,925 --> 00:11:36,803
I've lived here pretty much all my life,

142
00:11:36,845 --> 00:11:38,413
and that hospital has been weird,

143
00:11:38,455 --> 00:11:41,433
even before they closed down in 1986.

144
00:11:41,475 --> 00:11:45,103
You have to realize this
was a religious hospital,

145
00:11:45,145 --> 00:11:48,313
and they took in alcoholics
and drug addicts.

146
00:11:48,355 --> 00:11:51,563
And those were some of
the most tortured souls

147
00:11:51,605 --> 00:11:52,808
that you can imagine.

148
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,948
The night you made the 911 call.

149
00:11:59,315 --> 00:12:01,948
Are you normally taking
walks late at night?

150
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:06,503
Well, it sounds like I'm
being a bit of a suspect now.

151
00:12:06,545 --> 00:12:07,663
Doesn't it?

152
00:12:07,705 --> 00:12:08,496
Not at all.

153
00:12:08,538 --> 00:12:10,815
I'm just trying to get as
many details as possible.

154
00:12:11,945 --> 00:12:14,853
Well, I have terrible insomnia,

155
00:12:14,895 --> 00:12:18,913
and this area is pretty safe,

156
00:12:18,955 --> 00:12:22,648
and I just wanted to take a
walk to calm down a little bit.

157
00:12:23,525 --> 00:12:27,128
And I was walking past and I
heard this horrible scream.

158
00:12:28,595 --> 00:12:29,948
Like a person scream?

159
00:12:31,655 --> 00:12:33,548
Definitely not a person.

160
00:12:34,495 --> 00:12:37,738
I got a video of the sound,
definitely wasn't human.

161
00:12:39,365 --> 00:12:41,953
Wait, you have a video?

162
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:42,828
Can I see it?

163
00:12:46,315 --> 00:12:48,958
Yeah, take me a minute to find it.

164
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,924
Okay. Got it.

165
00:12:56,966 --> 00:12:57,933
I have your number from earlier,

166
00:12:57,975 --> 00:12:59,393
and I'll just send it over to you.

167
00:12:59,435 --> 00:13:02,809
See what you think.

168
00:13:02,851 --> 00:13:03,934
There you go.

169
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:20,754
[man and creature scream]

170
00:13:27,025 --> 00:13:28,413
I have no idea what the police

171
00:13:28,455 --> 00:13:29,938
would be interested in this.

172
00:13:33,975 --> 00:13:35,213
What time did this happen?

173
00:13:35,255 --> 00:13:38,405
Right at 3:00 AM, witching hour.

174
00:13:39,955 --> 00:13:41,233
What?

175
00:13:41,275 --> 00:13:42,983
Witching hour, you know,

176
00:13:43,025 --> 00:13:45,768
people say weird things
tend to happen at 3:00 AM.

177
00:13:48,585 --> 00:13:49,548
Witching hour.

178
00:13:51,234 --> 00:13:52,067
Yeah.

179
00:13:53,553 --> 00:13:57,058
But it's probably just
some urban legend, right?

180
00:14:10,845 --> 00:14:12,758
It's 3:00 AM now,

181
00:14:13,965 --> 00:14:17,478
and we're not really seeing
anything or hearing anything.

182
00:14:18,715 --> 00:14:21,523
I know I said we were
just gonna wait outside,

183
00:14:21,565 --> 00:14:25,288
but how would you feel
if we tried to get in?

184
00:14:41,935 --> 00:14:43,495
This way.

185
00:14:43,537 --> 00:14:46,120
[gate rattles]

186
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:48,122
[Security Guard] Hey!

187
00:14:48,164 --> 00:14:49,983
Go, go, go!

188
00:14:50,025 --> 00:14:53,025
[suspenseful music]

189
00:15:09,346 --> 00:15:12,013
[Sarah mumbles]

190
00:15:19,705 --> 00:15:21,105
No one wants to talk to you.

191
00:15:23,725 --> 00:15:25,342
No one will fucking talk to you.

192
00:15:33,735 --> 00:15:34,568
Fuck.

193
00:16:11,547 --> 00:16:16,547
Well, I now have criminal
trespass to add to my repertoire,

194
00:16:25,935 --> 00:16:28,268
and it comes with a $2,000 fine.

195
00:16:31,645 --> 00:16:32,478
Perfect.

196
00:16:35,707 --> 00:16:36,807
This is going so well.

197
00:16:43,038 --> 00:16:43,871
Oh, God.

198
00:16:51,867 --> 00:16:56,867
I think maybe we should
call this quits, you know?

199
00:17:02,198 --> 00:17:04,508
This isn't really going anywhere.

200
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:09,355
At least not anywhere good, so yeah, bye.

201
00:17:16,965 --> 00:17:21,233
You fucked up, 'cause that's not me,

202
00:17:21,275 --> 00:17:22,878
and that's never gonna be me.

203
00:17:23,795 --> 00:17:26,933
I'm loud and I'm pissed off,

204
00:17:26,975 --> 00:17:28,393
and I'm not gonna stop,

205
00:17:28,435 --> 00:17:30,688
even if I can't make this fucking movie.

206
00:17:32,255 --> 00:17:33,443
Never gonna stop.

207
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:35,723
Not until I find out the truth

208
00:17:35,765 --> 00:17:37,315
about what happened that night.

209
00:17:39,965 --> 00:17:41,148
The truth is mine.

210
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:47,073
I own it, and I'm never
going to stop coming for it.

211
00:17:47,115 --> 00:17:50,438
I have no life and no shame,

212
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:53,768
and I'm not gonna stop.

213
00:17:55,765 --> 00:17:57,623
I will find him.

214
00:17:57,665 --> 00:18:00,378
I will find him again.

215
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:51,002
[man speaks in muffled voice]

216
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:16,145
[Man] Where are you?

217
00:19:16,187 --> 00:19:17,437
It's not funny.

218
00:19:23,157 --> 00:19:26,990
[man speaks in muffled voice]

219
00:19:44,586 --> 00:19:48,419
[man speaks in muffled voice]

220
00:20:00,994 --> 00:20:03,661
[woman screams]

221
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:16,523
Okay, so this happened three nights ago.

222
00:20:16,565 --> 00:20:18,943
It got uploaded last night.

223
00:20:18,985 --> 00:20:19,793
Everywhere took it down,

224
00:20:19,835 --> 00:20:23,383
except for this weird Russian place.

225
00:20:23,425 --> 00:20:25,638
Some kids broke into Yorktown Hospital.

226
00:20:27,045 --> 00:20:28,773
One is missing,

227
00:20:28,815 --> 00:20:31,433
the other has been taken in
for a psychological evaluation,

228
00:20:31,475 --> 00:20:32,798
but isn't saying much.

229
00:20:34,295 --> 00:20:35,483
This is it.

230
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:36,813
This is exactly what we needed.

231
00:20:36,855 --> 00:20:38,983
This proves that there's
something going on.

232
00:20:39,025 --> 00:20:40,348
That I'm not crazy.

233
00:20:43,195 --> 00:20:45,958
I mean, I'm not crazy, but yeah,

234
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:49,748
we need to keep going.

235
00:20:51,135 --> 00:20:54,003
We need to figure out what
the hell is going on there.

236
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:54,973
It's not just about me.

237
00:20:55,015 --> 00:20:56,173
It's not about David.

238
00:20:56,215 --> 00:20:58,500
We have to do it for these kids as well.

239
00:20:58,542 --> 00:21:01,209
[phone buzzing]

240
00:21:05,745 --> 00:21:06,578
Hello?

241
00:21:09,155 --> 00:21:10,763
[Giles] Someone told
me about what happened

242
00:21:10,805 --> 00:21:12,333
to the kids the other night.

243
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:15,493
Yeah, it's terrible.

244
00:21:15,535 --> 00:21:17,985
[Giles] I may have some
things that might help.

245
00:21:20,017 --> 00:21:22,100
Come by soon as possible.

246
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:24,188
Oh, okay.

247
00:21:25,445 --> 00:21:26,648
I'll be right over.

248
00:21:31,385 --> 00:21:35,053
I'm a little hesitant to go back,

249
00:21:35,095 --> 00:21:36,313
considering the last time we saw him

250
00:21:36,355 --> 00:21:37,623
he pointed a gun at us,

251
00:21:37,665 --> 00:21:41,019
but he sounded really desperate.

252
00:21:41,061 --> 00:21:44,061
[suspenseful music]

253
00:22:05,197 --> 00:22:05,988
[Cameraman] Should we call the police?

254
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:06,863
No, fuck that.

255
00:22:08,305 --> 00:22:10,005
Let them figure it out themselves.

256
00:22:22,545 --> 00:22:24,878
[Cameraman] We need to go.

257
00:22:38,665 --> 00:22:40,048
This was David's radio.

258
00:22:43,715 --> 00:22:45,468
Why would Giles still have this?

259
00:22:46,315 --> 00:22:47,665
Why wouldn't he turn it in?

260
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:51,578
It's dead.

261
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:10,318
Shit, looks like he was having
some pretty fucked up dreams.

262
00:23:18,535 --> 00:23:20,218
Tape recorder with tape.

263
00:23:22,045 --> 00:23:23,313
[Unknown] It's okay.

264
00:23:23,355 --> 00:23:25,263
I just want you to first
take a deep breath,

265
00:23:25,305 --> 00:23:26,448
and clear your mind.

266
00:23:27,414 --> 00:23:28,958
[metronome ticks]

267
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,643
Just get used to the
rhythm in your head, Giles.

268
00:23:32,685 --> 00:23:33,893
[Giles] Okay.

269
00:23:33,935 --> 00:23:36,433
[Unknown] I want you to
picture the very last frame

270
00:23:36,475 --> 00:23:38,976
of what you saw that night.

271
00:23:39,018 --> 00:23:41,693
[Giles] I can't.

272
00:23:41,735 --> 00:23:43,773
[Unknown] Giles, please.

273
00:23:43,815 --> 00:23:44,868
This is to help you.

274
00:23:45,855 --> 00:23:50,855
Just picture that very last
image, like a Polaroid.

275
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:52,893
Then we can erase it.

276
00:23:52,935 --> 00:23:55,713
[Giles] It's tall.

277
00:23:55,755 --> 00:23:56,803
[Unknown] What do you see?

278
00:23:56,845 --> 00:24:01,343
[Giles] So tall, and its arms are long

279
00:24:01,385 --> 00:24:04,723
like a bunch of sticks.

280
00:24:04,765 --> 00:24:07,113
[Unknown] Good, good.
What else do you see?

281
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:08,783
[Giles] It's looking at me.

282
00:24:08,825 --> 00:24:10,475
[Unknown] Who's looking at you?

283
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,171
[Giles breathes heavily]

284
00:24:12,213 --> 00:24:13,915
Giles, what do you see now? Giles?

285
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:28,293
[Giles mutters]

286
00:24:28,335 --> 00:24:29,168
Giles?

287
00:24:35,913 --> 00:24:39,038
[person screams]

288
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,609
What the hell was that?

289
00:24:40,651 --> 00:24:41,541
[tape squeaking]

290
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:45,000
[distorted voices chant]

291
00:24:51,308 --> 00:24:53,725
[bell rings]

292
00:24:59,005 --> 00:25:02,338
[distorted voices yell]

293
00:25:10,937 --> 00:25:14,354
[Sarah breathes heavily]

294
00:25:28,995 --> 00:25:30,395
There's just a phone number.

295
00:25:38,835 --> 00:25:41,008
It's worth giving that a call, I think.

296
00:25:49,823 --> 00:25:52,490
[phone ringing]

297
00:25:58,503 --> 00:26:01,103
[Unknown Man] Hello?

298
00:26:01,145 --> 00:26:04,238
Hello, yes, this is Sarah Serling.

299
00:26:05,175 --> 00:26:06,403
I found your phone number.

300
00:26:06,445 --> 00:26:08,063
[Unknown Man] I know who you are.

301
00:26:08,105 --> 00:26:10,333
I've been waiting for your call.

302
00:26:10,375 --> 00:26:11,648
Is this line secure?

303
00:26:16,365 --> 00:26:17,813
For a few years, I was in charge

304
00:26:17,855 --> 00:26:19,603
of archiving the raw video data

305
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:21,808
from the city's police bodycam program.

306
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:24,603
One night, when I was working,

307
00:26:24,645 --> 00:26:27,345
I came across some footage
that kept me up for nights.

308
00:26:28,835 --> 00:26:30,385
Footage involving your husband.

309
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:34,303
After the incident, the station took over,

310
00:26:34,345 --> 00:26:36,683
and deleted everything off the servers.

311
00:26:36,725 --> 00:26:38,723
But I made a backup.

312
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:40,434
I'm gonna text you some coordinates.

313
00:26:40,476 --> 00:26:43,476
Be there in one hour and come alone.

314
00:26:46,949 --> 00:26:47,949
Stay here.

315
00:26:48,804 --> 00:26:51,637
[car door chimes]

316
00:27:18,585 --> 00:27:21,003
The truth is all in the footage,

317
00:27:21,045 --> 00:27:23,425
but it won't be easy to find.

318
00:27:23,467 --> 00:27:26,655
There's thousands and thousands
of hours of raw video.

319
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:32,275
Why are you helping me?

320
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:38,122
That footage is scratching
to get out into the world.

321
00:27:38,164 --> 00:27:42,266
It needs someone to open the cage.

322
00:27:42,308 --> 00:27:44,058
Is my husband dead?

323
00:27:48,272 --> 00:27:50,272
It's worse than death.

324
00:28:16,208 --> 00:28:17,041
Okay.

325
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:33,358
There's thousands of hours of video here.

326
00:28:34,945 --> 00:28:36,745
I don't know what I'm supposed to...

00:29:44,369 --> 00:29:45,476
[Jeff] Police department,
anybody in here?

330
00:29:45,518 --> 00:29:46,713
Show your hands.

331
00:29:46,755 --> 00:29:47,755
Make yourself known.

[door slams]

333
00:30:20,835 --> 00:30:24,229
Get on the ground! Get on the ground!

334
00:30:24,271 --> 00:30:25,104
Right now!

335
00:30:26,712 --> 00:30:28,225
Did you copy that?

336
00:30:28,267 --> 00:30:30,850
[Jeff screams]

337
00:30:42,485 --> 00:30:43,468
Wait, okay.

days before he disappeared.

344
00:31:36,346 --> 00:31:40,679
10-33, I need immediate
backup on Black Valley Road.

345
00:31:41,765 --> 00:31:43,165
I repeat, Black Valley Road.

346
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:54,265

[light switch clicks]

348
00:32:13,289 --> 00:32:14,080
You have been chosen, my friend.

349
00:32:14,122 --> 00:32:15,458
Put the weapon down, now!

350
00:32:16,585 --> 00:32:17,950
The Red Sister has shown
me your face in my visions.

351
00:32:17,992 --> 00:32:19,240
Put the weapon down or I will fire.

352
00:32:19,282 --> 00:32:20,713
Put it down!

353
00:32:20,755 --> 00:32:22,438
She is eternally hungry.

354
00:32:23,625 --> 00:32:24,416
Put the weapon down.

Wait, that symbol,
the symbol on the girl.

361
00:34:18,405 --> 00:34:20,163
We've seen that before.

362
00:34:20,205 --> 00:34:21,155
It was at Yorktown.

363
00:34:22,545 --> 00:34:23,623
Can you recall that footage?

364
00:34:23,665 --> 00:34:24,948
Can we see it again?

00:34:26,494 --> 00:34:29,244
[tape squeaking]

366
00:34:31,957 --> 00:34:34,624
It's the same symbol, identical.

367
00:34:36,135 --> 00:34:37,922
Let's see who this guy is.

368
00:34:46,942 --> 00:34:51,318
It says it was a murder-suicide.

369
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:56,548
Doesn't make sense.

370
00:35:00,065 --> 00:35:01,215
We saw David shoot him.

371
00:35:04,776 --> 00:35:07,943
[keyboard keys click]

372
00:35:13,865 --> 00:35:15,478
This is the guy from the video.

373
00:35:22,195 --> 00:35:23,788
Wait, he has a different name?

374
00:35:33,802 --> 00:35:36,469
[phone ringing]

375
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:40,743
[Benny] Hello.

376
00:35:40,785 --> 00:35:45,392
Hi, is this Benny Pelayo?

377
00:35:46,263 --> 00:35:47,054
[Benny] That's me.

378
00:35:47,096 --> 00:35:48,213
How can I help you?

379
00:35:48,255 --> 00:35:50,393
Yeah, I was wondering
if you were perhaps

380
00:35:50,435 --> 00:35:52,338
related to Dan Pelayo.

381
00:35:53,245 --> 00:35:54,410
[Benny] Don is my brother,

382
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:56,943
but we really haven't
spoken in many years.

383
00:35:56,985 --> 00:35:59,438
Ah, I see.

384
00:36:01,105 --> 00:36:03,373
I'm investigating a disappearance,

385
00:36:03,415 --> 00:36:05,403
and his name came up.

386
00:36:05,445 --> 00:36:08,698
I was wondering if maybe
I could talk to you.

387
00:36:11,195 --> 00:36:13,845
[Benny] Why don't you come
by tomorrow around noon?

388
00:36:15,427 --> 00:36:16,260
Okay.

389
00:36:19,055 --> 00:36:20,403
We'll be there.

390
00:36:20,445 --> 00:36:21,278
Thank you.

391
00:36:23,795 --> 00:36:25,645
It looks like we have plans tomorrow.

392
00:36:27,653 --> 00:36:30,570
[wind chimes ring]

393
00:36:55,935 --> 00:36:59,316
Hey, what time is it?

394
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:00,817
[Cameraman] It's 11 AM.

395
00:37:00,859 --> 00:37:05,103
Shit. I was up all night
going through those videos.

396
00:37:05,145 --> 00:37:07,683
Trying to find any more of David's,

397
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:12,725
and, yeah, I got a
little distracted, sorry.

398
00:37:16,685 --> 00:37:18,838
Can you give me a second?

399
00:37:22,664 --> 00:37:25,164
[birds chirp]

400
00:37:40,555 --> 00:37:41,388
Hi.

401
00:37:45,715 --> 00:37:46,723
Benny?

402
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:49,773
I'm Benny. You must be Sarah.

403
00:37:49,815 --> 00:37:51,353
Yeah.

404
00:37:51,395 --> 00:37:52,773
What's with all this?

405
00:37:52,815 --> 00:37:55,533
We're just filming all
our interviews with people.

406
00:37:55,575 --> 00:37:56,598
I hope that's okay.

407
00:37:57,645 --> 00:37:58,698
Well, I see.

408
00:38:02,365 --> 00:38:03,468
Please, come inside.

409
00:38:10,245 --> 00:38:11,698
Don was my twin brother.

410
00:38:12,825 --> 00:38:15,413
We both were heavily involved
in the shamanistic side

411
00:38:15,455 --> 00:38:17,128
of Native American culture.

412
00:38:18,175 --> 00:38:20,183
It's in our blood, you see.

413
00:38:20,225 --> 00:38:23,733
Although, I practiced more of
the lighter side of things.

414
00:38:23,775 --> 00:38:25,498
He was into the darker stuff.

415
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:28,358
What about his suicide?

416
00:38:30,245 --> 00:38:31,673
He did not commit suicide.

417
00:38:31,715 --> 00:38:32,865
I can promise you that.

418
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:35,595
It must've been a setup.

419
00:38:36,935 --> 00:38:38,835
He must've been into something rotten.

420
00:38:40,875 --> 00:38:42,088
A cover-up? Why?

421
00:38:44,645 --> 00:38:46,043
I don't know what type of information

422
00:38:46,085 --> 00:38:47,285
you're looking for here,

423
00:38:48,765 --> 00:38:52,813
but this whole town has
been built upon hexed land.

424
00:38:52,855 --> 00:38:56,153
They knew it then, and they know it now.

425
00:38:56,195 --> 00:38:59,493
For years, weird things have
been happening around here.

426
00:38:59,535 --> 00:39:02,748
And they've been coming down
here trying to cover things up.

427
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:05,613
And this city is already
on the verge of poverty.

428
00:39:05,655 --> 00:39:08,918
The last thing they
need is more bad press.

429
00:39:10,135 --> 00:39:11,773
I understand that.

430
00:39:11,815 --> 00:39:13,323
My husband was a police officer,

431
00:39:13,365 --> 00:39:15,888
and he went missing in yorktown hospital.

432
00:39:19,245 --> 00:39:21,138
They just pretend nothing happened.

433
00:39:23,055 --> 00:39:24,605
It doesn't surprise me a bit.

434
00:39:25,535 --> 00:39:27,383
Yorktown has always been a hotbed

435
00:39:27,425 --> 00:39:29,958
of evil, unnatural activity.

436
00:39:39,121 --> 00:39:40,415
What about this?

437
00:39:40,457 --> 00:39:41,803
Have you seen this symbol before?

438
00:39:41,845 --> 00:39:43,348
Where did you see this?

439
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:45,713
I saw it on the wall in Yorktown

440
00:39:45,755 --> 00:39:48,618
and in a video with your brother.

441
00:39:49,945 --> 00:39:53,118
That is the sign of the Red Sister,

442
00:39:54,945 --> 00:39:58,228
a kind of Skadegamutc, or ghost witch.

443
00:39:59,665 --> 00:40:01,313
The Native American myth goes

444
00:40:01,355 --> 00:40:06,153
that she finds a nesting place,

445
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:08,638
and feeds on the blood of humans.

446
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:10,641
And if you're lucky,

447
00:40:10,683 --> 00:40:13,653
she would just feed on
you and leave you to die.

448
00:40:13,695 --> 00:40:14,486
But if not,

449
00:40:14,528 --> 00:40:18,303
she will feed on you until
you take the eternal walk,

450
00:40:18,345 --> 00:40:20,468
a walk into darkness for eternity.

451
00:40:22,725 --> 00:40:24,175
Sarah, I know you're hurting,

452
00:40:25,595 --> 00:40:28,278
and I know you want your
husband back very bad.

453
00:40:29,265 --> 00:40:32,483
But there's usually no coming
back from this type of thing.

454
00:40:32,525 --> 00:40:36,453
And if you get too close to
the darkness, you will fall in.

455
00:40:36,495 --> 00:40:37,883
I don't care about darkness.

456
00:40:37,925 --> 00:40:40,508
I just need David. I need to know.

457
00:40:44,134 --> 00:40:46,533
[thunder roars]

458
00:40:46,575 --> 00:40:49,588
There might be a way for
me to find some answers,

459
00:40:51,715 --> 00:40:53,038
but it won't be easy.

460
00:40:57,215 --> 00:40:59,648
There's a sacred land,
not too far from here.

461
00:41:01,092 --> 00:41:03,488
A place where I do my
more dangerous sessions.

462
00:41:05,525 --> 00:41:07,293
If you can meet me there tomorrow night,

463
00:41:07,335 --> 00:41:09,837
I might be able to find some answers.

464
00:41:09,879 --> 00:41:10,712
Okay.

465
00:41:13,082 --> 00:41:13,963
Do you have a pen?

466
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:14,838
Oh, yeah.

467
00:41:22,445 --> 00:41:25,363
Meet me at this address,

468
00:41:25,405 --> 00:41:27,193
and bring something very personal

469
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:29,523
that belonged to your husband.

470
00:41:29,565 --> 00:41:30,828
Like a shirt?

471
00:41:31,925 --> 00:41:34,528
Something that he
touched almost every day.

472
00:41:37,605 --> 00:41:38,805
Before you go...

473
00:41:53,375 --> 00:41:58,375
Before you go, watch
this tonight, if you can.

474
00:42:01,295 --> 00:42:02,778
Sorry for the old tech.

475
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:09,158
Thank you.

476
00:42:10,395 --> 00:42:13,752
Okay, dusted off the VCR, picked this up.

477
00:42:31,127 --> 00:42:34,127
This is the tape that Benny gave us.

[flute music]

480
00:43:06,121 --> 00:43:08,013
[Narrator] Since the beginning of time,

481
00:43:08,055 --> 00:43:10,553
witches have appeared in myths of cultures

482
00:43:10,595 --> 00:43:13,978
from all over the world,
including the Native Americans.

483
00:43:17,555 --> 00:43:19,703
These horrific beings originated

484
00:43:19,745 --> 00:43:21,553
in the legends of several tribes

485
00:43:21,595 --> 00:43:23,683
in the southern United States,

486
00:43:23,725 --> 00:43:25,528
more specifically, Texas.

487
00:43:28,565 --> 00:43:31,618
The more well-known myth
is that of the Skadegamutc,

488
00:43:32,745 --> 00:43:34,918
also known as a ghost witch.

489
00:43:36,815 --> 00:43:41,633
A kind of ancient, evil shaman
who refuses to stay dead.

490
00:43:41,675 --> 00:43:44,503
The undead shaman comes alive at night

491
00:43:44,545 --> 00:43:48,523
and stalks the land for
unsuspecting victims.

492
00:43:48,565 --> 00:43:51,193
The only way to maintain their immortality

493
00:43:51,235 --> 00:43:54,212
is to feed on the blood
and flesh of humans.

494
00:43:57,052 --> 00:44:00,173
One of the more lesser known
variants of the ghost witch

495
00:44:00,215 --> 00:44:03,153
goes by the name the Red Sister,

496
00:44:03,195 --> 00:44:05,328
due to her eternal lust for blood.

497
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,353
According to legends,

498
00:44:09,395 --> 00:44:12,262
the only way to destroy
the Red Sister is to-

[Cameraman] Do you trust this guy?

504
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:11,900
Yeah, I trust him.

505
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:13,775
I think he means well.

Did you bring the personal
item with you that I asked you?

509
00:46:23,529 --> 00:46:24,362
Yes.

Can you hear me?

534
00:50:13,495 --> 00:50:14,648
David, I need you.

00:50:21,546 --> 00:50:26,546
I'm just gonna to need some time, okay?

00:50:28,889 --> 00:50:31,132

[Narrator #2] Deep in south Texas

541
00:51:43,985 --> 00:51:46,293
sits one of the most haunted locations

542
00:51:46,335 --> 00:51:48,143
in the United States,

543
00:51:48,185 --> 00:51:50,078
the Yorktown Memorial Hospital.

544
00:51:51,135 --> 00:51:53,343
The hospital was originally created

545
00:51:53,385 --> 00:51:54,953
by a Roman Catholic group,

546
00:51:54,995 --> 00:51:59,073
known as the Felician
sisters in the 1950s.

00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:01,863
It was mainly used as
a rehabilitation center

548
00:52:01,905 --> 00:52:04,788
for drug addicts and those
fighting alcohol abuse.

549
00:52:05,675 --> 00:52:08,623
Many patients checked
into Yorktown hospital,

550
00:52:08,665 --> 00:52:10,620
but many never checked out.

[eerie music]

552
00:52:13,465 --> 00:52:16,353
It's estimated almost 2,000 people died

553
00:52:16,395 --> 00:52:18,723
inside the walls of the hospital,

554
00:52:18,765 --> 00:52:20,548
many from unknown causes.

555
00:52:21,465 --> 00:52:24,283
Following negative press
from all the deaths,

556
00:52:24,325 --> 00:52:27,593
the hospital finally closed down in 1986

557
00:52:27,635 --> 00:52:29,623
after losing funding.

558
00:52:29,665 --> 00:52:32,483
But the hospital remained standing.

559
00:52:32,525 --> 00:52:36,513
Today, Yorktown Memorial
Hospital sits on private land,

560
00:52:36,555 --> 00:52:38,793
where numerous paranormal investigations

561
00:52:38,835 --> 00:52:40,183
have been performed,

562
00:52:40,225 --> 00:52:43,298
some capturing terrifying moments on film.

563
00:52:46,675 --> 00:52:49,123
Is it possible the tormented souls

564
00:52:49,165 --> 00:52:51,843
of almost 2,000 people still wander

565
00:52:51,885 --> 00:52:54,823
around the halls of Yorktown hospital?

566
00:52:54,865 --> 00:52:57,543
There have been many attempts
by the people of the city

567
00:52:57,585 --> 00:53:01,423
to have the hospital torn
down, but all have failed.

568
00:53:01,465 --> 00:53:03,683
The hospital still stands today,

569
00:53:03,725 --> 00:53:07,378
like a rotting corpse deep
in the heart of Texas.

571
00:53:30,675 --> 00:53:31,675
Did you hear that?

572
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:34,873
That's his voice.

573
00:53:34,915 --> 00:53:36,088
I'm 100 percent sure.

574
00:53:39,045 --> 00:53:41,613
Listen, I need to ask you just one favor.

575
00:53:41,655 --> 00:53:44,843
And then, I promise this
will be done forever.

576
00:53:44,885 --> 00:53:46,843
We need to go back to Yorktown.

577
00:53:46,885 --> 00:53:48,688
I'll pay you double what we agreed.

578
00:53:49,655 --> 00:53:52,573
All you have to do is
be there and film it.

579
00:53:52,615 --> 00:53:55,413
After that, I will be
out of your life forever.

580
00:53:55,455 --> 00:53:56,308
I promise.

It's almost 3 AM and
the front door is open.

It's five minutes till three.

584

what are we looking for?

586
00:56:34,241 --> 00:56:35,074

[shoes pacing]

588
00:57:21,545 --> 00:57:24,298
It still says five minutes to three.

589
00:57:27,675 --> 00:57:29,325
But we've been here over an hour.

590
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:35,470
[keys jingle and door opens]

591
00:57:39,675 --> 00:57:40,508

595
00:58:20,488 --> 00:58:22,821
Is someone screwing with us?

00:58:47,002 --> 00:58:50,728
Look over here, bunch
of tapes, patient names.

598
00:58:51,685 --> 00:58:54,748
June García, John Davis.

599
00:59:15,275 --> 00:59:16,588
My name is on this tape.

600
00:59:30,874 --> 00:59:34,291
[Sarah breathes heavily]

601
00:59:37,918 --> 00:59:40,897
[Unknown Woman] Now, you keep telling me

602
00:59:40,939 --> 00:59:43,131
that your husband is missing.

603
00:59:43,173 --> 00:59:46,456
But that's not quite true, is it?

604
00:59:46,498 --> 00:59:48,248
[Sarah] It is true.

605
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:49,790
He's been missing.

606
00:59:50,982 --> 00:59:52,937
I have to find him.

607
00:59:52,979 --> 00:59:56,325
[Unknown Woman] Sarah, you
have never been married before.

608
00:59:56,367 --> 00:59:59,284
We have double checked all records.

609
01:00:00,438 --> 01:00:02,772
[Sarah] That's not true.

610
01:00:02,814 --> 01:00:06,618
[Unknown Woman] Perhaps this
man was just a lover you had.

611
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:09,910
Are you a whore, Sarah? A woman of sin?

612
01:00:12,305 --> 01:00:13,905
[Sarah] Fuck you.

613
01:00:13,947 --> 01:00:16,713
[Unknown Woman] Do you
know where whores go?

614
01:00:16,755 --> 01:00:18,838
They go straight to hell.

615
01:00:19,879 --> 01:00:24,046
They suffer for all eternity
in pain and darkness.

616
01:00:25,565 --> 01:00:27,946
Is that where you want to go?

617
01:00:27,988 --> 01:00:30,681
[Sarah] I'd rather be in hell than here.

618
01:00:30,723 --> 01:00:32,038
That's not me.

619
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:33,031
Tell me that's not fucking me.

620
01:00:33,073 --> 01:00:35,173
[Unknown Woman] Perhaps
another round of electrotherapy

621
01:00:35,215 --> 01:00:37,679
will help clear your conscience.

622
01:00:37,721 --> 01:00:38,554
No.

623
01:00:41,827 --> 01:00:43,618
[Unknown Woman] They told
you to stay away from here,

624
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:44,976
didn't they?

Are you in the hospital?
