1
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,576
Training flight
Zulu-One-Niner,

2
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,478
This is Tower.

3
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:00,313
Tower, this is
One-Niner, go ahead.

4
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:01,882
We're gonna have you
come back in,

5
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:04,584
we're getting reports
a civilian aircraft

6
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:05,886
may have wandered
into your sector.

7
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:07,654
We're gonna see if
we can't run him off.

8
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:08,889
Record your
training exercise

9
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:10,857
Report back to base
immediately.

10
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,826
Roger that, Tower.

11
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:15,829
THIS IS
TEAM LEADER.

12
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:17,330
YOU HEARD HIM.

13
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,498
I THINK THAT'LL DO IT
FOR TODAY...

14
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:19,666
... let's head
on home.

15
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:20,834
ROGER THAT, SIR.

16
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:23,336
YOU GUYS WHIPPED US
PRETTY GOOD TODAY.

17
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,505
Like the song says,
Martinez,

18
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:27,207
"THERE'S ALWAYS TOMORROW."

19
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,410
DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE
INTO SHOW TUNES, SIR.

20
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,012
I guess you're one guy
I won't have to worry about

21
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:34,347
SNEAKING IN
MY TENT AT NIGHT.

22
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:36,850
YOU'LL PAY FOR
THAT ONE, MARTINEZ.

23
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:39,686
Promises,
promises, sir.

24
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:55,535
SHIT !

25
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,542
TOWER, THIS IS
ZULU-BRAVO-ONE-NINER,

26
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,711
Zulu-Bravo-One-Niner,
this is tower.

27
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,079
Go ahead.

28
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,848
WE'VE BEEN ENGAGED
BY AN UNIDENTIFIED AIRCRAFT.

29
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:08,849
I REPEAT,

30
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:11,485
WE HAVE BEEN ENGAGED
BY AN UNIDENTIFIED AIRCRAFT.

31
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:13,687
I HAVE ONE BIRD DOWN,
MARTINEZ IS DEAD.

32
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,859
What type of
aircraft, One-Niner ?

33
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:21,328
A SCORPION, BLACK.

34
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:23,396
NO MARKINGS
OF ANY KIND.

35
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:24,698
I'M IN PURSUIT.

36
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,067
Stay with him,
One-Niner,

37
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:28,935
I have six birds
going to your coordinates,

38
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,670
I repeat, I have
six birds en route.

39
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:39,746
WHERE IS HE ?

40
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:47,687
TOWER...
WHERE ARE THESE... !?

41
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:56,696
DAMN IT, I'M HIT.

42
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:58,865
Hang in there,
One-Niner.

43
00:04:58,865 --> 00:04:59,966
Hang in there !

44
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,641
Help will be there
in two minutes.

45
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:10,010
C'MON, C'MON !

46
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:19,819
DIE !

47
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,547
WATCH OUT FOR
THE WAVES, DADDY.

48
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,583
OH, REALLY ?

49
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,017
WELL, I WOULD WATCH OUT
FOR THE WATER

50
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,719
BUT SOMEBODY HAS
THEIR HANDS OVER MY EYES.

51
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,955
YOU GOTTA
TRUST ME, DADDY.

52
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:56,489
TRUST YOU ?

53
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:57,824
LAST TIME I TRUSTED YOU

54
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:00,126
I HAD TO BUY YOU
A NEW PAIR OF SHOES.

55
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:01,528
YOU THINK
THAT'S FUNNY, HUH ?

56
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,630
YOU THINK
THAT'S FUNNY ?

57
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,803
LOOK, A SEA MONSTER.

58
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:12,138
A SEA MONSTER, WHERE ?
OH, NO !

59
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:15,041
YOU TRICKED ME !

60
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:05,659
BAILEY, BAILEY...

61
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:07,961
GET AWAY
FROM THE WATER.

62
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:09,996
GET AWAY FROM
THE WATER.

63
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:14,567
C'MON !

64
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:06,553
BAILEY, STOP, STOP.

65
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:08,888
WE'VE GOT
TO GET GOING.

66
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:11,257
NO !

67
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:13,860
YES, C'MON, YOUR
MOTHER WILL KILL ME

68
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,829
IF YOU MISS
YOUR PLANE.

69
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:23,136
WHAT'S
THE MATTER ?

70
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:25,805
I DON'T WANT
TO GO TO NEW YORK.

71
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,741
REALLY ?

72
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,275
DON'T YOU WANT
TO SEE GRANDMA ?

73
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:33,279
NO, I HATE IT WHEN
SHE PINCHES MY CHEEKS.

74
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,683
PINCH HER BACK,
IT ALWAYS WORKS FOR ME.

75
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:00,740
EXCUSE ME, BUT AREN'T
YOU JORDAN MCNAMARA ?

76
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:03,076
YES, WELL, GUILTY.

77
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:05,745

00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:07,814

00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:09,149
THAT'S MY HUSBAND, STANLEY,
HE DIDN'T BELIEVE ME.

80
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,884
HE SHOULD
KNOW BETTER.

81
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,753
I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT 
"STATE OF THE NATION"

82
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:16,389
IS ONE OF OUR
FAVORITE PROGRAMS.

83
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,190
WE NEVER MISS IT.

84
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,725
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

85
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,127
I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU SINCE
YOU WERE JUST A REPORTER.

86
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:24,330
NOW YOU HAVE YOUR
OWN SHOW AND ALL.

00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:30,036
WOULD YOU MIND... ?

90
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,271
AN AUTOGRAPH.

91
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:33,973
WHO SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT AN AUTOGRAPH ?

92
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:35,975
STANLEY, COULD YOU
COME OVER HERE

93
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:38,011

00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:40,800
WELL, I GOT
THE TARGET SPOTTED.

125
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,003

UH-HUH.

00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:47,333
YOU'RE THE MOST IMPORTANT
THING IN THE WORLD TO ME.

00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:50,036
YOU SWEAR ?

139
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:51,437

TAKE THE SHOT !

145
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:13,126
HE'S A REPORTER,
FOR CHRIST SAKES.

146
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,495
YOU WILL
TAKE THE SHOT.

147
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,332
THAT'S AN ORDER.

148
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,301
Do you copy ?

149
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:24,037

SOMETHING'S IN THE SAND
RIGHT NEXT TO THAT MAN.

155
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:21,127
MAYBE IT'S
A SEA MONSTER, HUH ?

156
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:23,596
MAYBE WE SHOULD
WARN THE NICE MAN.

157
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:30,503

00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:52,191
PUT HER TO SLEEP.

163
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:28,494
EXCUSE ME,

192
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:18,524
SAMUELS, REPORT.

193
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:25,765

00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:40,813
EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE ALRIGHT.

198
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:34,633
SECURITY JUST
PUT IN A 911 CALL.

199
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:35,734
LOCALS ARE
ON THEIR WAY.

200
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:36,836
S.W.A.T. TEAM,
THE WHOLE DEAL.

201
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:38,838
THE MEDIA WILL
PROBABLY BEAT 'EM THERE.

202
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:40,673
LITTLE BITCH.

203
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:46,812
LET'S GET THE HELL
OUT OF HERE.

204
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:48,581
GIVE ME
THAT PHONE.

205
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:49,949
WE CAN STILL DO
A SWEEP FOR HER.

206
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:54,653
SHE'S NOT EVEN IN 
THE SAME ZIP CODE ANYMORE.

207
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:59,859
YEAH, THIS IS DALTON,
WE'RE COMING IN.

208
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,300
SPARE CHANGE ?

209
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,641
OH, GOD BLESS YOU.

210
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,647
OH, MY !

211
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,830
( male )
Identify
yourself.

212
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,465
IT'S ME.

213
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,567
That narrows it
down some, don't it.

214
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:43,002
You're gonna have to
do better than that.

215
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:44,870
GODAMMIT, MARCUS,
I DON'T HAVE
TIME FOR THIS.

216
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,872
LET ME IN OR I'M
GONNA FUCKIN' KILL YOU.

217
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:47,807
HEY GIRL, YOU SHOULD
HAVE STARTED OUT

218
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,375
WITH ALL THOSE
CURSE WORDS.

219
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:50,809
THEN I WOULD HAVE KNOWN
IT WAS YOU RIGHT OFF.

220
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,044
MARCUS.

221
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:53,612
Okay, okay.

222
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:18,037
YOU'RE ABOUT
TWO DAYS EARLY.

223
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:20,940
TWO DAYS LATE DEPENDING
ON HOW YOU LOOK AT IT.

224
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,875
LOOK AT YOU.

225
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,810
ROUGH DAY
AT THE OFFICE.

226
00:22:27,046 --> 00:22:28,347
I GUESS SO.

227
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,818
WHAT'S WRONG ?

228
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:36,121
WHAT'S UP ?

229
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:38,524
I NEED YOUR HELP.

230
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:40,859
SEE, AND HERE I THOUGHT YOU
FINALLY CAME TO YOUR SENSES

231
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,661
AND DECIDED
TO SEDUCE A BROTHER.

232
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,198
WHAT DO YOU NEED ?

233
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,701
I NEED
AN ADDRESS.

234
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:50,636
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

235
00:22:50,636 --> 00:22:53,872
LET'S JUST TAKE A LITTLE
TRIP TO THE DMV.

236
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:58,010
YOU GONNA TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED ?

237
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:03,649
HE TRIED TO KILL
ME THIS MORNING.

238
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,885
SEE, THAT'S
MANAGEMENT FOR YOU.

239
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,588
ALWAYS TRYING TO FIRE YOU
BEFORE YOU CAN QUIT ON 'EM.

240
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:10,923
IT'S A GOOD THING 
WE PUT TOGETHER 

241
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:12,791
THAT SEVERANCE 
PACKAGE, HUH ?

242
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:14,827
YOU GOT A
NAME FOR ME ?

243
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:16,962
JORDAN MCNAMARA.

244
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:17,930
JORDAN MCNAMARA.

245
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:20,566
NAME SOUNDS FAMILIAR,
I DON'T KNOW WHERE FROM.

246
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:23,869
HE WAS IN THAT NEW SHOW
"STATE OF THE NATION".

247
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:25,037
OH, RIGHT.

248
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:27,973
I DON'T WATCH
VERY MUCH TV.

249
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:29,174
YOU'RE KIDDING, EVER ?

250
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:31,543
I FIND TV TO BE
VERY EDUCATIONAL.

251
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:32,811
THE MINUTE SOMEBODY
TURNS IT ON

252
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:34,880
I GO TO THE LIBRARY
AND READ A GOOD BOOK.

253
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:36,715
GROUCHO MARX.

254
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:40,853
( female )
Welcome to the Department
of Motor Vehicles.

255
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:42,755
THAT'S HIM ?

256
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:48,027
YOU'RE FUCKING FABULOUS.

257
00:23:48,027 --> 00:23:49,628
YEAH, I KNOW.

258
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:51,530
SO, HOW DO
WE KNOW HIM ?

259
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,800
HE WAS MY TARGET
THIS MORNING.

260
00:23:57,036 --> 00:23:58,504
YEAH.

261
00:23:58,504 --> 00:23:59,538
OKAY.

262
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:01,040
FAMOUS,
RICH, HANDSOME.

263
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,208
THAT'S REASON TO
KILL HIM RIGHT THERE.

264
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:08,514
ANOTHER JOB WELL DONE,
MR. DALTON.

265
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:13,018
FOUR OF OUR
OPERATIVES DOWN.

266
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:15,521
A VERITABLE
MEDIA CIRCUS.

267
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:18,757
AND THE LOCAL POLICE HAVE
A DESCRIPTION OF A WOMAN

268
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:21,927
WHO APPEARS WOULD BE QUITE
ADEPT WITH FIRE ARMS.

269
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,530
SURE IT'S JUST 
AN OVERSIGHT ON YOUR PART,

270
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:25,864
BUT MAYBE YOU
MISSED THE MEMO

271
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:28,033
WHEREBY I GAVE THE ORDER 
THAT SHE BE TERMINATED

272
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:29,702
THE EARLIEST
POSSIBLE CONVENIENCE.

273
00:24:30,903 --> 00:24:32,738
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I WAS TRYING TO DO.

274
00:24:32,738 --> 00:24:35,007
I WAS TRYING TO 
FOLLOW THAT ORDER.

275
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:37,743
WELL, YOU'VE
LOST ME.

276
00:24:37,743 --> 00:24:39,144
BECAUSE IT WOULD APPEAR

277
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:42,047
THAT NOT ONLY WAS
THE ORDER NOT FOLLOWED,

278
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:44,049
BUT THAT SHE WAS
GIVEN AN ASSIGNMENT

279
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:46,185
UPON WHICH
THE VERY SURVIVAL

280
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:48,187
OF THIS ORGANIZATION
DEPENDS.

281
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:52,057
WE HAD A PLAN
TO TERMINATE HER

282
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:56,795
AFTER SHE COMPLETED
THE SANCTION ON MCNAMARA.

283
00:24:58,297 --> 00:25:01,000
SEEMS TO ME YOU'RE MISSING
THE GODDAMN POINT, MR. DALTON.

284
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,701
MY PROBLEM WAS SHE
WAS GIVEN THE ASSIGNMENT

285
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:03,869
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

286
00:25:04,737 --> 00:25:06,939
IT WAS A 950 YARD SHOT.

287
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:12,945
NOW, SHE TOOK OUT MEDIVIC
IN SARAJEVO 

288
00:25:12,945 --> 00:25:16,815
AT 1,175.

289
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:20,853
I DIDN'T HEAR
ANY COMPLAINTS THEN.

290
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:25,057
I PICKED THE BEST
PERSON FOR THE JOB.

291
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:27,025
LET'S NOT HORSESHIT AROUND.

292
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:29,928
I THINK WE BOTH KNOW
WHY YOU PICKED HER.

293
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,032
FIND HER.

294
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,534
BEFORE THE POLICE DO.

295
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:38,871
I'D LIKE TO KEEP
THIS IN THE FAMILY.

296
00:25:41,173 --> 00:25:42,875
MCNAMARA, 
CONTINGENCY PLAN.

297
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:44,910
WE HAVE SURVEILLANCE
FOLLOWING HIM

298
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:48,046
OUT TO HIS EX-WIFE'S 
HOUSE IN LAGUNA.

299
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:51,717
SHOULD TAKE HIM ABOUT
AN HOUR TO GET THERE.

300
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:54,887
HOUR AND A HALF
TO GET BACK.

301
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:57,689
AND AS SOON AS HE GETS THERE,
WE'RE GONNA TAKE HIM OUT.

302
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:01,693
AND WE'LL GO INSIDE

304
00:26:03,996 --> 00:26:07,065
AND IT'LL ALL
BE TAKEN CARE OF.

305
00:26:08,167 --> 00:26:10,702
ALRIGHT, LET'S TRY NOT TO 
FUCK THIS ONE UP, SHALL WE.

306
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:17,876
YOU ARE GONNA CHANGE
THAT SHIRT, AREN'T YOU ?

307
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:22,014

KEEP YOU OUT OF TROUBLE.

327
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,021
ALTHOUGH I DOUBT
THAT'S POSSIBLE.

328
00:27:37,189 --> 00:27:41,226

THESE GOT YOU

YOU REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED
LAST TIME WE WERE IN MEXICO ?

336
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:59,811
I'M NOT GOING
ANYWHERE.

337
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,348
SEE, I GUESS I 
HAD IT ALL WRONG.

338
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,217
I THOUGHT THE IDEA
WAS TO DISAPPEAR,

339
00:28:05,217 --> 00:28:07,119
YOU KNOW, LIVE 
HAPPILY EVER AFTER.

340
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:09,254
IT WAS, BUT IT'S NOT NOW.

341
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:11,823
THIS IS WHY YOU CAN'T 
KEEP A MAN, ALRIGHT ?

342
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:13,158
HALF OF THIS

WILL INTIMIDATE THE CRAP
OUT OF YOUR AVERAGE GUY.

344
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:17,296
MAKE HIM THINK TWICE
ABOUT MAKING A MOVE ON YOU.

345
00:28:17,296 --> 00:28:19,164
MAYBE EVEN THREE
OR FOUR TIMES.

346
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:20,866
YOU'D BE
SURPRISED.

347
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,169
WHY YOU DOING THIS ?

348
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:27,706

CAN'T RUN AWAY FROM.

349
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,943
ALRIGHT, LOOK.

350
00:28:30,943 --> 00:28:32,811

354
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:38,984
YOU GO BACK IN THERE,
YOU'RE GONNA DIE.

355
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:40,385
I DIED A LONG TIME AGO.

356
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,487
AND A HUNDRED
TIMES SINCE.

357
00:28:43,522 --> 00:28:45,490
FIRST ETELAND, 
NOW MCNAMARA.

358
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:47,859
I JUST GOTTA
MAKE IT STOP.

359
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:54,199
SO, WHAT ARE
YOU GONNA DO ?

360
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:56,969
DALTON IS GONNA
MOVE IN ON THIS GUY TODAY.

361
00:28:56,969 --> 00:28:59,104
I JUST GOT TO
GET THERE FIRST.

362
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:21,059
MR. DALTON.

363
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:22,494
YEAH.

364
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:25,330
HE'S CHECKING HIS MESSAGES
THROUGH HIS CELL PHONE.

365
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:28,200
( female )
You have
one message.

366
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,203
( male )
Hey, dude,

367
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:33,038
it's your prick-face
producer calling.

368
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:34,306
Having
a nice day ?

369
00:29:34,306 --> 00:29:36,208
Well, I'm gonna
fucking ruin it.

370
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:37,843
I need something on 
the Eteland story 
by first thing tomorrow.

371
00:29:37,843 --> 00:29:39,177
Call if you
have a problem.

372
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:42,147
GODDAMN RIGHT,
THERE'S A PROBLEM.

373
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:45,217
HE'S CALLING 
HIS PRODUCER NOW.

374
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:47,552
SEE IF 
YOU CAN JAM IT.

375
00:29:49,221 --> 00:29:50,889
YOU THE MAN, SIR,
CONSIDER IT DONE.

376
00:29:51,223 --> 00:29:52,991
( female )
Mr. Pendado will be 
with you in just a moment.

377
00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:55,961
HE JUST CALLED ME.

378
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:56,962
IT'S OKAY, YOU CAN
BREAK INTO THE MEETING.

379
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:00,365
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

380
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:02,868
WE ARE HAVING
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES.

381
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:06,171
THE TROUBLE
IS NOT IN YOUR SET.

382
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:08,407
HELLO.

383
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:09,307
HELLO.

384
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,609
ARE YOU THERE ?

385
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:12,210
OH, SHIT !

386
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:14,146
THAT'S IT,
I'M GOING DIGITAL.

387
00:30:25,357 --> 00:30:26,925
THAT'S HIM,
HE'S COMING IN.

388
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:08,300
HI THERE,
YOU JORDAN MCNAMARA ?

389
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,068
YEAH, AND YOU ARE ?

390
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:11,503
SPECIAL AGENT RICHARDS, FBI.

391
00:31:11,503 --> 00:31:14,673
WHAT CAN I
DO FOR YOU ?

392
00:31:14,673 --> 00:31:16,508
WELL, YOU CAN DROP
THE WEAPON FOR ONE.

393
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:18,610
IT MAKES ME NERVOUS.

394
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,345
IT'S MY DAUGHTER'S.

395
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:21,313
I SHOULD HOPE SO,

396
00:31:21,313 --> 00:31:23,215
YOU LOOK A LITTLE
OLD FOR THAT.

397
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:25,016
SO, WHAT...

398
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:26,351
PRETTY ROUTINE,
ACTUALLY.

399
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:28,153
WE NEED TO ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS

400
00:31:28,153 --> 00:31:29,121
about the Eteland matter.

401
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:31,256
We need you to come down
to the office with us.

402
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:33,492
WHAT ABOUT ETELAND ?

403
00:31:33,492 --> 00:31:35,293
WE'LL GET INTO THAT
DOWN AT THE OFFICE.

404
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:36,995
IF YOU'LL JUST
COME WITH US.

405
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:38,130
AM I UNDER ARREST ?

406
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,364
NO, NO, NOTHING
LIKE THAT.

407
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:40,565
IT'S A FEW QUESTIONS,

408
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,434
I'LL GET YOU
RIGHT BACK HERE.

409
00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:44,503
LISTEN, I CAN'T ANSWER ANY
QUESTIONS ON THAT STORY

410
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:47,672
WITHOUT THE ADVICE
OF A NETWORK ATTORNEY.

411
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:48,974
I UNDERSTAND.

412
00:31:48,974 --> 00:31:50,308
YOU WANT TO MAKE 
A PHONE CALL.

413
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:52,177
HAVE HIM COME
DOWN AND JOIN US.

414
00:31:52,177 --> 00:31:54,146
OKAY, JUST
BE A SECOND.

415
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:56,515
HE DIDN'T BITE,
C'MON IN.

416
00:31:56,515 --> 00:31:57,649
EXCUSE ME.

417
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:06,391
YOU WANT TO LIVE,
YOU'LL COME WITH ME.

418
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:08,426
WHO ARE YOU ?

419
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,028
I'M THE FUCKING
TOOTH FAIRY.

420
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:11,363
C'MON.

421
00:32:11,363 --> 00:32:13,298
YOU JUST KILLED
TWO FBI AGENTS.

422
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:14,466
THEY'RE NOT FBI,

423
00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:16,301
THEY WERE HERE
TO KILL YOU.

424
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:18,603
LOOK, I GOT
ABOUT 30 SECONDS.

425
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,705
HOW DO I KNOW YOU'RE NOT
HERE TO DO THE SAME THING ?

426
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:22,174
BECAUSE YOU'RE
STILL ALIVE.

427
00:32:22,174 --> 00:32:24,209
THERE'S YOUR
FIRST FUCKING CLUE.

428
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:27,479
THERE'S YOUR SECOND.

429
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:29,181
C'MON.

430
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:50,602
SHE GOT FRANK.

431
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:53,338
THAT FUCKING BITCH.

432
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:59,044
SHE'S USING
HIM AS BAIT.

433
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:04,082
I TAUGHT HER
HOW TO DO THAT.

434
00:33:05,584 --> 00:33:06,651
WE GOTTA DO SOMETHING.

435
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:15,060
HOW'S THAT, BABY ?

436
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,371
HEY, HONEY.

437
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:29,140
I TELL YOU WHAT.

438
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,775
WHY DON'T WE 
MAKE A DEAL ?

439
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:39,551
YOU COMPLETE
THE SANCTION
ON THE NEWS BOY,

440
00:33:39,551 --> 00:33:44,422
WE'LL GO OUT
AND HAVE A DRINK
AND CALL IT A DAY.

441
00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:47,459
WHAT DO YOU THINK ?

442
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:49,227
COMPLETE
THE SANCTION.

443
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:50,495
DOES THAT MEAN--

444
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:51,630
THEY'RE GONNA 
TRY AND FLANK US.

445
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:52,230
WE GOTTA GET
OUT OF HERE.

446
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,498
I'M NOT
HEARING NOTHING.

447
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:55,600
THAT'S A BAD SIGN.

448
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:58,670
C'MON, HONEY,
LET'S BE FRIENDS.

449
00:33:59,638 --> 00:34:00,839
HERE TAKE THIS.

450
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:01,606
WHAT ?

451
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:05,477
TAKE IT !

452
00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:07,145
THERE'S A ROAD ACROSS
THE RAILROAD TRACKS

453
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:08,680
ABOUT A MILE
THAT WAY.

454
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,415
BLACK CANYON ROAD.

455
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:13,151
THERE'S A BLUE PICKUP TRUCK 
PARKED ON THE SHOULDER.

456
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:14,853
FIND IT AND
WAIT FOR ME.

457
00:34:14,853 --> 00:34:16,221
ARE YOU KIDDING ?
THEY'RE SHOOTING !

458
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:17,489
I'LL COVER FOR YOU,
JUST GET GOING.

459
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:18,690
JEEZ !

460
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:22,460
LISTEN, I GOT THIS
ALL FIGURED OUT.

461
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,629
THEY'RE HEADED FOR 
BLACK CANYON ROAD.

462
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:29,501
SHE'LL INSERT THERE.

463
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:33,772
SHE'LL BE HEADING
ACROSS COUNTRY

464
00:34:33,772 --> 00:34:35,540
LOOKING FOR
A VEHICLE.

465
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:10,508
DROP IT !

466
00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:15,313
HANDS ON THE HEAD.

467
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:17,349
TURN AROUND.

468
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:19,517
THIS IS
GONNA BE FUN.

469
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:25,523
THAT WAS FROM ME,
YOU FUCKING BITCH.

470
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:27,559
AND THIS
ONE'S FOR FRANK.

471
00:35:30,395 --> 00:35:32,630
I'LL TELL DALTON
WHAT A GOOD JOB YOU DID.

472
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,324
FUCK THIS.

473
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:02,721
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU
TO HEAD FOR THE ROAD.

474
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:04,723
YOU WEREN'T
AVOIDING ME,
WERE YOU ?

475
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:06,891
NO.

476
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,326
GOOD.

477
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:09,794
I'LL HAVE
THAT PISTOL BACK.

478
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:15,533
SHALL WE ?

479
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:25,376
WHO ARE YOU ?

480
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,312
WHAT IS GOING
ON HERE ?

481
00:37:27,312 --> 00:37:29,047
I USED TO WORK
FOR THE GOVERNMENT.

482
00:37:29,047 --> 00:37:30,815
THE GOVERNMENT.

483
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:32,016
LET ME GUESS.

484
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:33,752
POSTAL SERVICE.

485
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:34,819
C'MON.

486
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:36,421
CIA ?

487
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:37,789
WHY DO THEY
WANT YOU DEAD ?

488
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:39,390
THEY, WHO ?

489
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,493
I'LL GET
TO THAT.

490
00:37:41,493 --> 00:37:44,362
YOU KNOW SOMETHING THEY'RE
AFRAID OF, WHAT IS IT ?

491
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:46,464
THIS IS GETTING SURREAL.

492
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:50,635
LOOK, I CAN'T HELP YOU
IF I DON'T KNOW WHY

493
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:51,803
THEY WANT YOU DEAD.

494
00:37:51,803 --> 00:37:54,005
YOU'VE DONE A GREAT
JOB HELPING SO FAR.

495
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:55,373
JUST THIS MORNING
I WAS SAYING

496
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:56,841
I HAVEN'T BEEN
SHOT AT ENOUGH LATELY,

497
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:58,710
REALLY GOT TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.

498
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,978
DIDN'T LOOK
THAT WAY TO ME.

499
00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:01,646
WHAT ?

500
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:02,847
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT ?

501
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:04,115
THE BEACH.

502
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,049
THIS MORNING WITH
YOUR DAUGHTER.

503
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:06,484
WHAT...

504
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:08,353
WHAT ARE YOU 
TALKING ABOUT ?

505
00:38:08,353 --> 00:38:10,388
THE MAN BACK THERE,
HE DIDN'T LOOK FAMILIAR ?

506
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:12,423
WHY SHOULD HE ?

507
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:15,927
THAT'S RIGHT.

508
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:17,629
HE WAS THERE TO KILL ME
WITH MY DAUGHTER ?

509
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,598
HE WAS THERE AS
A SPOTTER FOR A SNIPER.

510
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:25,703
HOW DO YOU KNOW ?

511
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:27,038
THERE'S
THE ROAD, C'MON.

512
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,713
WE'RE IN LUCK.

513
00:38:40,952 --> 00:38:42,420
I THOUGHT THAT WAS
YOUR TRUCK BACK THERE.

514
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,755
IT WAS.

515
00:38:43,755 --> 00:38:46,024
WHO'S IS
THIS THEN ?

516
00:38:46,024 --> 00:38:48,359
I DON'T KNOW,
PROBABLY SOME HIKERS.

517
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:50,728
YOU GONNA
ANSWER MY QUESTION ?

518
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,933
UNTIL THIS MORNING

519
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:55,633
I USED TO WORK FOR THE PEOPLE
THAT ARE AFTER YOU.

520
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:58,503
AND WHO ARE THEY ?

521
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:01,506
AN ELITE C.T. UNIT.

522
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,808
ULTRA BLACK,
CALLED ALPHA SECTION.

523
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:05,410
C.T. ?

524
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:08,413
COUNTER
TERRORIST ?

525
00:39:08,413 --> 00:39:10,014
( alarm )

526
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:12,417
WHAT ARE
YOU DOING ?

527
00:39:12,417 --> 00:39:13,651
WE NEED A CAR.

528
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:15,853
EXCUSE ME.

529
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:18,890
SOMEONE'S GONNA HEAR
THIS AND CALL THE POLICE.

530
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:20,391
HOLD THAT.

531
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:23,027
YOU ALWAYS CALL 911 WHEN 
YOU HEAR A CAR ALARM GO OFF ?

532
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:34,038
WHAT DID YOU
DO WITH THE C.T. ?

533
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:36,574
I WAS A SPECIALIST 
IN EXECUTIVE OPERATIONS.

534
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:38,109
YOU'RE AN ASSASSIN.

535
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:39,978
JESUS CHRIST.

536
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:51,422
YOU DIDN'T
SHOOT ME.

537
00:39:54,192 --> 00:39:55,927
WHAT STOPPED YOU ?

538
00:39:55,927 --> 00:39:57,128
GET IN THE
GODDAMN CAR.

539
00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:58,162
NO, I'M NOT GETTING
IN THE CAR WITH A--

540
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:01,699
GET IN THE GODDAMN CAR !

541
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:03,668
( gunshots )

542
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,675
GET IN THE
GODDAMN CAR !

543
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:15,713
YOU DON'T LISTEN
VERY WELL, DO YOU ?

544
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:19,851
SHIT !

545
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:12,637
YEAH, THIS IS
DALTON HERE.

546
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:13,938
( male )
Go ahead, Dalton.

547
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:15,807
I NEED
AN AIR UNIT.

548
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:17,642
Copy that,
got a 20 ?

549
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:18,810
BLACK CANYON.

550
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:25,984
THIS IS NOT
HAPPENING.

551
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:27,852
DENIAL, THAT'S
A GOOD SIGN.

552
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:29,187
HEALTHY.

553
00:41:29,187 --> 00:41:33,157
THIS IS ABOUT
THE THOMAS ETELAND MURDER.

554
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,625
HE WAS KILLED FOR
WHAT HE KNEW ABOUT

555
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:36,194
THE ARMY HELICOPTER
INCIDENT IN ARIZONA.

556
00:41:36,194 --> 00:41:37,929
IS THAT IT ?

557
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:42,033
ETELAND 
KNEW SOMETHING ?

558
00:41:42,033 --> 00:41:42,934
LAST SUMMER,

559
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:44,235
THE ARMY HELICOPTERS 
THAT WERE SHOT DOWN 

560
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:45,737
BY THE SUPPOSED 
MILITIA GROUP.

561
00:41:45,737 --> 00:41:48,005
ETELAND HEADED 
THE ARMY INVESTIGATION.

562
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:50,208
I NOTICED STRANGE THINGS
HAPPENING FROM THE DAY 

563
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:51,743
HE WAS ASSIGNED
TO THE CASE.

564
00:41:51,743 --> 00:41:53,745
STRANGE ?

565
00:41:53,745 --> 00:41:56,013
HE CAME ACROSS EVIDENCE
THAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN 
A GOVERNMENT COVER-UP.

566
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,582
WHAT KIND
OF EVIDENCE ?

567
00:41:57,582 --> 00:42:00,017
KEY PIECES OF THE WRECKAGE
THAT HAD BEEN LOGGED IN

568
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,986
JUST DISAPPEARED.

569
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:03,654
SO HE WENT BACK OUT 
TO THE CRASH SIGHT.

570
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:05,656
HE FOUND A PIECE OF
THE SO-CALLED, "MILITIA CHOPPER"

571
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:06,858
THAT HE COULD I.D.

572
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:09,327
THAT CHOPPER HAD BEEN
DELIVERED BACK IN 1985,

573
00:42:09,327 --> 00:42:11,195
STRAIGHT FROM THE FACTORY 
TO A COMPANY CALLED 

574
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,264
TRITON LTD. INTERNATIONAL.

575
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:17,135
ABOUT WHICH I'VE BEEN
ABLE TO FIND EXACTLY ZERO.

576
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:21,339
THE F.A.A. RECORDS SHOW THAT
THIS CHOPPER CRASHED IN 1994,

577
00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:23,040
AFTER IT WAS
SOLD TO A GUY

578
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,010
WITH ASSOCIATIONS TO 
AN ARIZONA MILITIA GROUP.

579
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:28,212
BUT THIS GUY HAD 
BEEN KILLED LATER 

580
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,915
IN AN A.T.F. RAID 
THAT WENT AWRY.

581
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:33,084
SO, HE COULDN'T 
BE QUESTIONED.

582
00:42:33,084 --> 00:42:34,819
IT'S CONVENIENT AND
JUST A LITTLE STRANGE.

583
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:36,320
NOT WHEN YOU MENTION 
TRITON INTERNATIONAL, 

584
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,990
NOTHING SOUNDS STRANGE.

585
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:40,191
YOU KNOW
WHO THEY ARE ?

586
00:42:40,191 --> 00:42:42,293
THEY'RE THE FRONT
FOR ALPHA SECTION.

587
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:46,798
SO ETELAND, HE WAS 
FORCED OFF THE CASE ?

588
00:42:46,798 --> 00:42:49,367
TECHNICALLY, HE QUIT
JUST BEFORE HE WENT

589
00:42:49,367 --> 00:42:51,636
TO HIS SUPERIORS
WITH HIS EVIDENCE.

590
00:42:51,636 --> 00:42:52,804
HE WAS VISITED
BY A GROUP OF MEN

591
00:42:52,804 --> 00:42:55,072
WHO SAID IF HE AND
HIS FAMILY WANTED

592
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,707
TO CONTINUE TO 
ENJOY GOOD HEALTH,

593
00:42:56,707 --> 00:42:57,875
THEY SHOULD STICK 
TO EVIDENCE 

594
00:42:57,875 --> 00:42:59,310
THAT POINTED TO 
MILITIA INVOLVEMENT.

595
00:43:00,111 --> 00:43:01,846
"DOMESTIC TERRORISM"
WAS THEIR PHRASE.

596
00:43:02,814 --> 00:43:04,048
SO, THAT'S THE GAME.

597
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:05,183
THE GAME ?

598
00:43:05,183 --> 00:43:07,018
DOMESTIC TERRORISM.

599
00:43:07,018 --> 00:43:10,154
ALPHA'S OPERATIONS OVERSEAS HAD 
BEEN VIRTUALLY SHUT DOWN.

600
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:12,223
ALL WET-OPS HAVE
BEEN SUSPENDED.

601
00:43:12,223 --> 00:43:14,358
ASSASSINATIONS
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

602
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:16,360
IT'S LIKE ORDERING TELEVISION
NOT TO RUN COMMERCIALS.

603
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,363
SO, WE'VE CHANGED OUR
FOCUS TO DOMESTIC TERRORISM.

604
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:21,132
THAT'S 
THE FBI'S TURF.

605
00:43:21,132 --> 00:43:22,366
EXACTLY.

606
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:24,635
IT'S A PRETTY 
CHOICE PIECE.

607
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:27,738
THEY'RE TRYING TO SHOW THAT 
THE FBI CAN'T HANDLE IT ALONE.

608
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:31,209
SO, THEY'VE CREATED A THREAT
WHERE THERE WAS NONE.

609
00:43:31,209 --> 00:43:34,812
SO ALPHA SECTION,
A U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY,

610
00:43:34,812 --> 00:43:38,116
KILLED AMERICAN SOLDIERS
TO JUSTIFY THEIR EXISTENCE

611
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:40,718
AND THEN KILLED ANOTHER 
SOLDIER JUST TO COVER IT UP ?

612
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,156
WELCOME TO THE
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY.

613
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:53,664
( door buzzer )

614
00:43:56,968 --> 00:43:57,835
WHO IS IT ?

615
00:43:57,835 --> 00:43:59,203
( Jenna )
It's us.

616
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:09,147
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED ?
I WAS GETTING WORRIED.

617
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:10,815
PIECE OF CAKE.

618
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:13,718
WE BROUGHT
YOU A NEW CAR.

619
00:44:13,718 --> 00:44:15,086
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE OLD ONE ?

620
00:44:15,086 --> 00:44:16,320
YOU DON'T
WANNA KNOW.

621
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:22,159
AHEM !

622
00:44:24,462 --> 00:44:26,130
AHEM !

623
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:30,434
SINCE YOU'RE GONNA
BE SO RUDE

624
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:32,837
AS TO NOT INTRODUCE US,
I'M MARCUS.

625
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:34,372
JORDAN MCNAMARA.

626
00:44:34,372 --> 00:44:36,807
AS SEEN ON TV.

627
00:44:36,807 --> 00:44:38,376
IT'S NICE TO MEET
YOU AND ALL,

628
00:44:38,376 --> 00:44:40,178
BUT YOU GOTTA FORGIVE ME,
I DON'T WATCH A LOT OF TV.

629
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:41,312
I FEEL IT'S 
THE BLAND--

630
00:44:41,312 --> 00:44:43,247
LEADING THE BLAND,
I'VE HEARD 'EM ALL.

631
00:44:43,247 --> 00:44:44,682
BELIEVE ME.

632
00:44:45,483 --> 00:44:46,851
WHAT'S THIS ?

633
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:48,052
IT'S NICE.

634
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:49,420
OH, THAT'S 
SOMETHING I'M--

635
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,689
YEAH, SURE, GO RIGHT AHEAD,
PUT IT ON.

636
00:44:55,293 --> 00:44:56,861
NEVER REALIZED HOW
IMPORTANT THE PROPER JEWELRY

637
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:58,829
WAS IN YOUR
LINE OF WORK.

638
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:01,465
THIS IS NO ORDINARY
PIECE OF JEWELRY, 
MR. MCNAMARA.

639
00:45:08,272 --> 00:45:09,740
WAVE TO THE LADY.

640
00:45:15,313 --> 00:45:16,948
FIBER-OPTIC CABLES.

641
00:45:16,948 --> 00:45:19,183
MICRO-TRANSMITTER,
BROADCAST RANGE, A MILE.

642
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:20,251
PICTURE AND SOUND.

643
00:45:20,251 --> 00:45:21,218
WHAT DO
YOU THINK ?

644
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:23,154
WORKS FOR ME.

645
00:45:23,154 --> 00:45:25,056
WORKS FOR YOU.

646
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:27,024
TWO HOURS AGO,
I WAS FUCKING FABULOUS.

647
00:45:28,326 --> 00:45:29,994
IT'S BEEN
A LONG DAY, ASK HIM.

648
00:45:29,994 --> 00:45:32,196
IT HAS.

649
00:45:32,196 --> 00:45:36,200
WELL, I HAVEN'T BEEN EXACTLY
HERE EATING BONBONS, YOU KNOW.

650
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,336
LISTEN, I WANTED TO 
ASK YOU A QUESTION.

651
00:45:38,336 --> 00:45:39,370
COULD I--

652
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:41,138
SHE WANTS TO
ASK ME A FAVOR.

653
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:43,307
SHE WANTS TO ASK
ME A FAVOR.

654
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:46,844
I WANTED TO KNOW IF I COULD
USE THE SHOWER, OKAY ?

655
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:49,246
SURE, BABY.

656
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:51,248
 MI CASA ES SU CASA.

657
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:52,450
THANKS.

658
00:45:55,353 --> 00:45:56,387
AND WHILE YOU'RE AT IT...

659
00:45:56,387 --> 00:45:57,822
YOU SHOULD
TAKE A NAP

660
00:45:57,822 --> 00:45:59,156
'CAUSE YOU
LOOK LIKE SHIT.

661
00:46:00,324 --> 00:46:02,159
YOU'RE ALWAYS THERE WITH 
A KIND WORD, AREN'T YA ?

662
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:03,995
NO, HON,
I'M ALWAYS HERE.

663
00:46:06,464 --> 00:46:07,531
GOT THAT ?

664
00:46:12,303 --> 00:46:14,205
THE INVISIBLE MAN.

665
00:46:14,205 --> 00:46:17,208
THIS GUY CRACKED IN
THE DEPARTMENT DEFENSE,

666
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:19,010
NORAD, 
FUJIMOTO BANK,

667
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:20,878
NOT TO MENTION
THE WHITE HOUSE.

668
00:46:20,878 --> 00:46:23,281
YOU KNOW HIM ?

669
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:26,017
NO, LET'S JUST 
SAY I'M A FAN.

670
00:46:26,017 --> 00:46:27,318
YOU KNOW
HIS NAME ?

671
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:28,486
NO.

672
00:46:28,486 --> 00:46:30,254
HENCE THE NAME,
THE INVISIBLE MAN.

673
00:46:30,254 --> 00:46:31,856
WHY ?

674
00:46:31,856 --> 00:46:34,492
I DID A STORY ON HIM.

675
00:46:36,227 --> 00:46:38,362
BACK BEFORE I BECAME
A RICH AND FAMOUS
NEWS READER,

676
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:40,998
BUT HE'S JUST 
A FASCINATING CHARACTER.

677
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:43,067
A LOT OF PEOPLE
THOUGHT SO.

678
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:45,169
RATINGS WENT THROUGH
THE ROOF ON THAT STORY.

679
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:48,339
HEY, THAT STORY WAS ONE GROSS
INACCURACY AFTER ANOTHER.

680
00:46:48,339 --> 00:46:50,374
THOUGHT YOU
DIDN'T WATCH TV.

681
00:46:50,374 --> 00:46:52,843
 WELL, YOU KNOW,
 PBS AND WHATNOT.

682
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:56,280
I'M ON WWZN.

683
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,183
YOU KNOW, I SOMETIMES LEAVE 
IT ON IN THE BACKGROUND.

684
00:47:09,894 --> 00:47:10,861
COME HERE
FOR A SECOND.

685
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:20,171
OH.

686
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:23,007
NOW THAT IS ONE 
HELL OF A WOMAN.

687
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:25,209
TAKE IT OFF
FOR DADDY.

688
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:26,510
YOU SHOULD SEE THAT
WOMAN WITH A HANDGUN.

689
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:29,246
I HAVE,
BELIEVE-YOU-ME.

690
00:47:33,651 --> 00:47:35,553
HMM...

691
00:47:38,155 --> 00:47:39,690
DAMN.

692
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,992
I GUESS
SHE TOLD ME.

693
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,462
I'M HUNGRY, I'M GONNA
GO GET SOMETHING TO EAT.

694
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:49,333
WHAT EXACTLY
DO YOU DO FOR HER ?

695
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:52,336
WELL, A WOMAN
IN HER LINE OF WORK

696
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:54,305
SOMETIMES REQUIRES
CERTAIN ITEMS

697
00:47:54,305 --> 00:47:56,006
THAT CAN'T BE
FOUND IN STORES.

698
00:47:56,006 --> 00:47:59,377
AND REQUIRE CERTAIN SERVICES
THAT AREN'T IN THE YELLOW PAGES,

699
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:01,345
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M SAYING ?

700
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:03,380
PICK.

701
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:05,416
I DON'T
LIKE CHINESE.

702
00:48:05,416 --> 00:48:07,485
WELL, SHE DOES.

703
00:48:07,485 --> 00:48:09,553
SO, GUESS WHAT ?

704
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,222
KUNG PO CHICKEN.

705
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:13,357
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING FOR HER NOW ?

706
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:15,693
WELL, LAST WEEK SHE CAME IN
AND SHE WANTED TO BECOME,

707
00:48:15,693 --> 00:48:18,963
SHALL WE SAY,
LIKE THE INVISIBLE MAN.

708
00:48:18,963 --> 00:48:20,331
SHE WANTS
TO DISAPPEAR ?

709
00:48:20,331 --> 00:48:22,399
THAT'S RIGHT AND 
I MADE IT POSSIBLE.

710
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:23,300
WAIT, WAIT.

711
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,335
THIS WAS
LAST WEEK.

712
00:48:24,335 --> 00:48:26,237
YEAH, WELL, SEE...

713
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:28,005
WHATEVER HAPPENED THAT DAY,
IT MADE HER WANT OUT.

714
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:30,007
AND THE PEOPLE
SHE WORKS FOR,

715
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:31,375
YOU JUST CAN'T GIVE
YOUR TWO WEEKS NOTICE

716
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:33,043
AND BE ON YOUR
MERRY WAY.

717
00:48:33,043 --> 00:48:34,245
IT TOOK A LOT
OF PLANNING.

718
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:36,180
NOW, SHE WANTS
TO GIVE IT UP

719
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:38,082
ALL FOR YOUR
SORRY ASS.

720
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:41,385
I DIDN'T ASK
FOR HER HELP.

721
00:48:41,385 --> 00:48:44,221
BUT YOU CERTAINLY ARE GLAD
YOU GOT IT, AREN'T YOU ?

722
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:54,198
TELL THEM IT'S FOR
THEIR OWN PROTECTION.

723
00:48:54,198 --> 00:48:56,066
TELL THEM THERE'S BEEN 
A THREAT ON THEIR LIVES,

724
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:57,601
BUT DON'T TOUCH ANYBODY

725
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,370
UNTIL YOU HEAR FROM ME,
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ?

726
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:01,539
OKAY, HOLD ON.

727
00:49:01,539 --> 00:49:04,441
WHAT THE FUCK
IS MCNAMARA'S WIFE ?

728
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:05,776
WHAT'S HER
MAIDEN NAME ?

729
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,745
UM... ROSE DANIELS.

730
00:49:07,745 --> 00:49:09,313
HER MOTHER.

731
00:49:09,313 --> 00:49:10,381
MMM-HMM.

732
00:49:10,381 --> 00:49:12,249
ROSE DANIELS.

733
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:14,018
ROSE DANIELS.

734
00:49:14,018 --> 00:49:15,986
CONNECT ME.

735
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:21,625
HELLO, ROSE...

736
00:49:28,232 --> 00:49:29,633
HOW OLD ARE 
YOU GUYS NOW, TWELVE ?

737
00:49:33,304 --> 00:49:34,305
WHERE'S MARCUS ?

738
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:36,173
HE WENT TO
GET CHINESE FOOD.

739
00:49:36,173 --> 00:49:37,608
HE'S FULL OF
GOOD IDEAS.

740
00:49:39,076 --> 00:49:41,212
HE'S A BIG FAN 
OF YOURS, TOO.

741
00:49:44,682 --> 00:49:46,083
WHAT ?

742
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:48,219
ETELAND.

743
00:49:48,219 --> 00:49:51,388
THAT WAS YOU,
WASN'T IT ?

744
00:49:53,624 --> 00:49:55,359
IT WAS A BLIND HIT.

745
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:58,429
THEY GIVE ME A CALL,
A LOCATION.

746
00:49:58,429 --> 00:50:00,164
THE MINUTE I ARRIVE
THEY GIVE ME A TARGET.

747
00:50:01,131 --> 00:50:02,466
AND THAT DAY IT JUST
HAPPENED TO BE HIM.

748
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:04,435
JUST LIKE THAT ?

749
00:50:04,435 --> 00:50:06,637
YEAH, JUST
LIKE THAT.

750
00:50:08,472 --> 00:50:09,740
I GUESS I SHOULD
BE REAL HAPPY

751
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,442
YOU GOT AN ATTACK OF
CONSCIENCE FOR MY...

752
00:50:11,442 --> 00:50:13,477
SANCTION.

753
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:17,348
YOU CAN GO
FUCK YOURSELF.

754
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:21,552
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHO 
HE WAS UNTIL THE NEXT DAY.

755
00:50:21,552 --> 00:50:23,254
SAW THE TV REPORTS.

756
00:50:23,254 --> 00:50:24,488
THE NEWS.

757
00:50:24,488 --> 00:50:25,489
I EVEN SAW YOUR
PIECE ON HIM.

758
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:28,425
I'M JUST NEVER
GONNA FORGET

759
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:30,027
THE LOOK ON
HIS WIFE'S FACE.

760
00:50:31,462 --> 00:50:33,330
IT'S NOT WHAT I GOT
INTO THIS FOR.

761
00:50:34,632 --> 00:50:37,301
WHAT DID YOU GET
INTO IT FOR ?

762
00:50:37,301 --> 00:50:39,336
I THOUGHT IT WAS BETTER
THAN BEING FOUND DEAD

763
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:41,372
OF UNKNOWN CAUSES.

764
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:43,641
THEY THREATENED YOU ?

765
00:50:43,641 --> 00:50:46,777
WELL, THEY HAVE A MORE 
OBLIQUE WAY OF SAYING IT.

766
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:49,580
THEY CHOSE ME.

767
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:52,650
SO, YOU WERE JUST FOLLOWING
ORDERS, IS THAT IT ?

768
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,086
FUCK THIS.

769
00:51:20,878 --> 00:51:22,580
I'M SORRY.

770
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,615
I'M NOT USED TO...

771
00:51:27,318 --> 00:51:28,619
THIS IS ALL JUST
A LITTLE OVER...

772
00:51:30,554 --> 00:51:33,424
I GUESS I JUST DON'T
KNOW HOW YOU HANDLE THIS.

773
00:51:33,424 --> 00:51:35,359
WHO SAYS I DO ?

774
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:40,597
YOU EVER...
FEEL GUILTY ?

775
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:42,766
EVERY GODDAMN DAY.

776
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:47,504
FOR A WHILE THERE,

777
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:49,506
I THOUGHT I WAS
ON THE RIGHT SIDE.

778
00:51:49,506 --> 00:51:50,774
AND NOW ?

779
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,878
WHAT CHANGED ?

780
00:51:54,878 --> 00:51:57,881
THE DIRECTOR ALTERED
OUR MISSION.

781
00:51:57,881 --> 00:52:00,684
INSTITUTED 
DIRECTIVE SEVEN.

782
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:02,953
WHAT WAS THAT ?

783
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:06,957
LET'S SAY IT'S STRESS PREEMPTION
OVER RETALIATION.

784
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:10,627
IF THEY ASSASSINATED
PEOPLE WHO...

785
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:13,931
WHO WERE KNOWN TO BE INVOLVED
WITH CERTAIN TERRORISTS GROUPS

786
00:52:13,931 --> 00:52:18,602
IN PLACES LIKE IRAQ, SERIA,
FORMER YUGOSLAVIA.

787
00:52:18,602 --> 00:52:21,538
BUT THEY HADN'T ACTUALLY
DONE ANYTHING ?

788
00:52:24,208 --> 00:52:25,876
POTENTIALS.

789
00:52:25,876 --> 00:52:27,478
ISN'T THAT
OUTRIGHT MURDER ?

790
00:52:32,349 --> 00:52:35,252
WHAT WOULD YOU NEED
TO BREAK THIS STORY ?

791
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:37,888
SHORT OF 
AN OUTRIGHT CONFESSION.

792
00:52:37,888 --> 00:52:40,624
SOMETHING SOLID
TO DOCUMENT.

793
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:44,561
SOMEONE FROM
THE INSIDE

794
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:46,230
WHO'S WILLING
TO GO ON RECORD.

795
00:52:49,299 --> 00:52:51,301
WHAT DO YOU THINK ?

796
00:52:51,301 --> 00:52:53,337
I THINK WE'D
BOTH BE DEAD

797
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:55,606
BEFORE YOU COULD 
TURN ON THE CAMERAS.

798
00:52:57,641 --> 00:52:59,543
YOU SHOULD HAVE
JUST KEPT RUNNING.

799
00:53:15,826 --> 00:53:17,961
WANT TO SEE ME ?

800
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:20,531
I'D LIKE YOUR OPINION,
MR. DALTON.

801
00:53:24,468 --> 00:53:25,769
ON ?

802
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:27,671
ON WHO SHOULD BE
YOUR REPLACEMENT.

803
00:53:29,573 --> 00:53:31,308
UH...

804
00:53:31,308 --> 00:53:33,043
THIS IS ALL
GONNA BE OVER

805
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:34,845
IN A COUPLE OF HOURS.

806
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,348
YOU KNOW, I WALKED 
IN THIS MORNING

807
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:40,217
THINKING THE SAME THING.

808
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:44,388
FUNNY HOW THINGS HAVE
A WAY OF TURNING OUT.

809
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:48,859
LISTEN THIS, MCNAMARA.

810
00:53:48,859 --> 00:53:52,796
HE'S GONNA LEAD US
RIGHT TO HER.

811
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:55,399
AND IT'S ONLY
A MATTER OF TIME

812
00:53:55,399 --> 00:53:57,401
BEFORE HE CHECKS IN.

813
00:53:57,401 --> 00:53:59,736
AND IF HE
SHOULD DECLINE ?

814
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:02,840
WELL, HE'S A VERY
REASONABLE MAN.

815
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:06,577
AND I THINK HE'LL
DO THE RIGHT THING.

816
00:54:08,345 --> 00:54:12,416
BOY, I'D REALLY LIKE TO SEE 
THIS BEHIND US, MR. DALTON.

817
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:14,551
YEAH.

818
00:54:18,856 --> 00:54:21,492
YOU KNOW, I WOULD'VE NEVER
AGREED TO HAVE DONE THIS

819
00:54:21,492 --> 00:54:23,360
IF I DIDN'T KNOW
HOW MANY BUILDINGS

820
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:25,362
THERE WERE
IN COUNTY RECORDS.

821
00:54:25,362 --> 00:54:27,364
WELL, I HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOU
IF THAT MEANS ANYTHING.

822
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:28,632
IT DOESN'T
MEAN SHIT.

823
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:31,635
I NEED TO CALL NEW YORK, CAN 
I USE YOUR PHONE TO DO THAT ?

824
00:54:31,635 --> 00:54:33,103
YEAH, SURE,
GO RIGHT AHEAD.

825
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,771
NO, HOLD IT, NO CALLS.

826
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:37,374
THIS ONE
HERE IS SECURE.

827
00:54:37,374 --> 00:54:39,877
HAVE ANOTHER DUMPLING,
MY DUMPLING.

828
00:54:39,877 --> 00:54:42,346
LET THE MAN
MAKE HIS CALL.

829
00:54:42,346 --> 00:54:45,382
YOU JUST GOT TO SHOW
THEM WHO'S THE BOSS.

830
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:49,386
CAN I HAVE SOME
PRIVACY SOME PLACE ?

831
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:50,888
BATHROOM.

832
00:54:50,888 --> 00:54:53,624
YEAH, THERE'S A LOT 
OF PRIVACY THERE.

833
00:54:54,858 --> 00:54:57,060
I'LL JUST GO OUT HERE.

834
00:54:58,829 --> 00:54:59,863
DUMPLING ?

835
00:55:01,865 --> 00:55:03,000
HERE WE GO.

836
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,968
52-03 ARGYLE.

837
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:06,970
I DON'T WANT TO SOUND NEGATIVE
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT, 

838
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,939
BUT THERE'S NO WAY THEY'RE 
JUST GONNA LET YOU WALTZ 

839
00:55:08,939 --> 00:55:10,874
THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR.

840
00:55:10,874 --> 00:55:13,143
RIGHT, BUT THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.

841
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,878
WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING FOR ?

842
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:17,848
A WET WALL.

843
00:55:17,848 --> 00:55:20,117
HOW COULD YOU TELL
FROM A DRAWING ?

844
00:55:20,117 --> 00:55:22,152
TELL WHAT ?

845
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,987
IF A WALL'S WET.

846
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:26,023
BECAUSE I--

847
00:55:26,023 --> 00:55:27,691
I'M PLAYING.

848
00:55:27,691 --> 00:55:28,892
I'M JOKING.

849
00:55:28,892 --> 00:55:30,627
YOU'RE ALL
UPTIGHT AND SHIT.

850
00:55:35,866 --> 00:55:38,802
HEY, ROSE,
IT'S JORDAN.

851
00:55:38,802 --> 00:55:42,506
JUST CALLING TO MAKE
SURE SHE GOT IN OKAY.

852
00:55:43,941 --> 00:55:46,510
WHAT DO
YOU MEAN ?

853
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:49,947
LOOK, THERE'S ALSO A CRAWL SPACE
BETWEEN THE STEEL DOORS HERE.

854
00:55:49,947 --> 00:55:53,584
BETWEEN THE FIRST FLOOR
AND THE BASEMENT.

855
00:55:53,584 --> 00:55:57,955
IT LOOKS LIKE I'LL HAVE ABOUT
16 INCHES BETWEEN THE WALLS

856
00:55:57,955 --> 00:56:00,023
AND 24 
BETWEEN THE DOORS.

857
00:56:01,825 --> 00:56:05,829
SHIT, YOU HAVE 10 INCHES
RIGHT NOW AFTER YOU--

858
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:07,097
OH !

859
00:56:07,097 --> 00:56:08,932
THAT HURT.

860
00:56:08,932 --> 00:56:10,667
THAT WAS
SUPPOSED TO.

861
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:16,840
DALTON HAS
MY DAUGHTER.

862
00:56:19,643 --> 00:56:21,178
DAMNIT, THIS IS MY CHILD
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT !

863
00:56:21,178 --> 00:56:23,146
I'M GONNA DO
WHATEVER HE WANTS.

864
00:56:23,146 --> 00:56:25,482
YOU'RE ALREADY DOING IT,
YOU'RE PANICKING.

865
00:56:25,482 --> 00:56:26,984
WHEN YOU PANIC,
HE CONTROLS THE GAME.

866
00:56:26,984 --> 00:56:28,218
GAME ?!

867
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:29,987
THIS MAY BE
A GAME TO YOU,

868
00:56:29,987 --> 00:56:31,221
BUT IT'S A LITTLE MORE
THAN THAT TO ME.

869
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:33,023
WELL, IT'S
A GAME TO HIM.

870
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,491
IF WE DON'T PLAY,

871
00:56:34,491 --> 00:56:36,927
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA SEE
YOUR DAUGHTER AGAIN.

872
00:56:36,927 --> 00:56:38,962
YOU'RE GONNA
TALK TO DALTON,

873
00:56:38,962 --> 00:56:41,031
BUT AFTER MARCUS AND I 
DO THE FINISHING TOUCHES

874
00:56:41,031 --> 00:56:42,866
ON OUR PLAN.

875
00:56:42,866 --> 00:56:45,102
WHOA, WHOA,
NOW MARCUS IS ON IT ?

876
00:56:45,102 --> 00:56:47,638
YOU'VE ALWAYS
BEEN IN ON IT.

877
00:56:47,638 --> 00:56:49,006
LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU 
GET A BOOK OR SOMETHING, 

878
00:56:49,006 --> 00:56:51,642
GO OUTSIDE, WE'VE GOT
WORK TO DO, ALRIGHT ?

879
00:56:51,642 --> 00:56:53,510
IF I'M GONNA BE
INVOLVED IN THIS,

880
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:55,178
DON'T YOU THINK I SHOULD KNOW
THE DETAILS OF THIS LITTLE--

881
00:56:55,178 --> 00:56:57,547
NO, YOU CAN'T.

882
00:56:57,547 --> 00:56:59,516
I'LL EXPLAIN
IT LATER.

883
00:56:59,516 --> 00:57:00,751
NO, YOU'LL EXPLAIN NOW.

884
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:03,220
MAYBE YOU SHOULD,
YOU KNOW.

885
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:06,523
YOU'RE GONNA
GO TALK TO DALTON,

886
00:57:06,523 --> 00:57:08,659
HE'S GONNA
TAKE YOU TO

887
00:57:08,659 --> 00:57:11,128
THE SHITTY LITTLE STORAGE ROOM
AT ALPHA'S FIELD OFFICE.

888
00:57:11,128 --> 00:57:12,863
HE'S GONNA TIE 
YOU TO A CHAIR,

889
00:57:12,863 --> 00:57:15,032
AND HE'S GONNA USE ONE OF
SEVERAL TECHNIQUES

890
00:57:15,032 --> 00:57:17,034
TO TRY AND GET AS MUCH
INFORMATION

891
00:57:17,034 --> 00:57:19,036
OUT OF YOU
AS HE WANTS.

892
00:57:19,036 --> 00:57:21,004
INCLUDING OUR PLAN.

893
00:57:21,004 --> 00:57:23,573
THIS IS
JUST GREAT.

894
00:57:23,573 --> 00:57:26,943
SO I'M JUST GONNA WALK
INTO THE LION'S DEN

895
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:29,179
WITH NO INSURANCE
THAT I'LL WALK OUT AGAIN.

896
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:31,648
YOU'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO TRUST ME.

897
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:34,217
TRUST YOU ?

898
00:57:34,217 --> 00:57:37,287
YOU WORK FOR AN AGENCY THAT 
LIES AS A MATTER OF POLICY.

899
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:40,190
BUT I HAVE TO
TRUST YOU ?

900
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:42,159
LOOK, THE WAY I SEE IT,

901
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:45,062
YOU DON'T HAVE
MUCH OF A CHOICE.

902
00:57:45,062 --> 00:57:47,731
BUT IF YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS,
I'M ALL EARS.

903
00:57:55,038 --> 00:57:55,939
( sighing )

904
00:57:58,875 --> 00:58:01,011
I NEED TO CATCH UP ON
MY READING ANYWAY.

905
00:58:06,216 --> 00:58:08,952
YOU MIND TELLING ME
THE PLAN, YOUR HIGHNESS ?

906
00:58:19,062 --> 00:58:20,731
YES, THIS
IS DALTON.

907
00:58:20,731 --> 00:58:22,799
WHERE'S
MY DAUGHTER ?

908
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:26,103
OH, I'M NOT SO SURE
I LIKE THAT TONE.

909
00:58:26,103 --> 00:58:27,838
WHERE IS SHE ?

910
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:30,006
THERE YOU
GO AGAIN.

911
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:33,210
YOU KNOW, YOU MIND
IF I CALL YOU

912
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:35,746
BY YOUR FIRST NAME ?

913
00:58:35,746 --> 00:58:36,847
JORDAN, I BELIEVE.

914
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:40,984
HELLO.

915
00:58:43,653 --> 00:58:44,988
I'M HERE.

916
00:58:44,988 --> 00:58:47,958
I thought
maybe you hung up.

917
00:58:47,958 --> 00:58:50,193
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE REALLY
IN NO POSITION

918
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:52,729
TO MAKE ANY
DEMANDS FROM ME.

919
00:58:52,729 --> 00:58:57,200
I MEAN, THIS ISN'T YOUR SILLY
TELEVISION SHOW, OKAY ?

920
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,003
YOU'D GET A LOT FARTHER WITH ME
IF YOU'D SPEAK NICER.

921
00:59:00,003 --> 00:59:02,005
USE WORDS LIKE...

922
00:59:02,005 --> 00:59:03,974
sweetheart.

923
00:59:03,974 --> 00:59:06,143
Don't be coy,

924
00:59:06,143 --> 00:59:10,914
I know you're there and 
I know you're listening.

925
00:59:10,914 --> 00:59:14,050
I KNOW YOU'RE WATCHING 
THAT SECOND HAND TICK.

926
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:16,653
I don't even need
to trace the call

927
00:59:16,653 --> 00:59:19,022
because I know
where you are.

928
00:59:19,022 --> 00:59:22,025
I want you both
here in one hour.

929
00:59:22,025 --> 00:59:24,361
IF YOU'RE NOT.

930
00:59:24,361 --> 00:59:27,130
I'M GONNA CALL THAT
SNOBBY LITTLE PRESCHOOL

931
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:29,032
AND TELL THEM THAT

932
00:59:29,032 --> 00:59:31,034
there's an opening

933
00:59:31,034 --> 00:59:34,805
ON THEIR WAITING LIST 
NEXT SEMESTER.

934
00:59:39,176 --> 00:59:40,877
EIGHT SECONDS LEFT.

935
00:59:40,877 --> 00:59:42,212
NOT BAD, HUH ?

936
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:11,808
( Jenna )
52-03 ARGYLE.

937
01:00:11,808 --> 01:00:15,278
ALPHA SECTION'S FIELD OFFICE 
IS IN THE BASEMENT.

938
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:17,380
YOU CAN TELL
FROM THE OUTSIDE

939
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:20,150
THEY LET LIFE
GO ON AS USUAL.

940
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:22,352
THAT WAY NOBODY 
NOTICES THEM.

941
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:26,323
SHOW UP AT THE DESK,
THEY'LL TAKE IT FROM THERE.

942
01:00:36,867 --> 01:00:39,169
( ringing bell )

943
01:00:39,169 --> 01:00:40,971
LOOKING FOR
A MR. DALTON.

944
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:42,138
GOOD FOR YOU.

945
01:00:44,074 --> 01:00:45,308
IS HE HERE ?

946
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:47,077
EXCUSE ME,
I'M ON THE PHONE.

947
01:00:47,077 --> 01:00:48,745
MCNAMARA.

948
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:52,382
COME WITH
ME PLEASE.

949
01:00:52,382 --> 01:00:54,217
PLEASE.

950
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:55,852
COME WITH ME.

951
01:01:14,137 --> 01:01:17,240
THERE SEEMS TO BE ONE LESS
PERSON THAN I EXPECTED.

952
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:18,241
WHERE'S MY DAUGHTER ?

953
01:01:18,241 --> 01:01:19,976
FIRST THING'S FIRST.

954
01:01:19,976 --> 01:01:21,478
WHERE'S
OUR FRIEND ?

955
01:01:21,478 --> 01:01:23,146
SHE WOULDN'T COME.

956
01:01:23,146 --> 01:01:26,182
YOU KNOW, YOU SEE 
THAT'S JUST LIKE HER.

957
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:28,318
SHE'S HARD-HEADED,
SELFISH,

958
01:01:28,318 --> 01:01:31,221
SHE HAS NO IDEA THE AFFECT 
THAT HER ACTIONS HAVE 

959
01:01:31,221 --> 01:01:34,324
ON THE EMOTIONS
OF OTHER PEOPLE.

960
01:01:34,324 --> 01:01:37,327
HOW DO YOU LIKE OUR
LITTLE COMPLEX HERE ?

961
01:01:37,327 --> 01:01:40,130
I'LL GIVE YOU MY OPINION
WHEN I SEE MY DAUGHTER.

962
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:43,300
YOU KNOW, I'M SURPRISED AT 
THE AGGRESSIVE TONE OF VOICE

963
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:45,035
YOU HAVE THERE.

964
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:46,703
CONSIDERING
YOUR SITUATION.

965
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:50,440
HAVE YOU SEEN
THE MOON THIS EVENING ?

966
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:53,209
YEAH, WHY ?

967
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:55,312
IT WAS A NICE MOON.

968
01:01:55,312 --> 01:01:57,247
BUT YOU'RE NOT LIKELY
TO SEE IT AGAIN

969
01:01:57,247 --> 01:02:00,083
FOR QUITE SOME TIME.

970
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:04,054
WHY DON'T YOU ESCORT
MR. MCNAMARA TO HIS ROOM ?

971
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:06,089
I'M GONNA GO
FIND LESTER.

972
01:02:06,089 --> 01:02:08,925
AND I'LL SEE YOU
IN A MINUTE.

973
01:02:11,194 --> 01:02:12,329
MR. MCNAMARA, 
PLEASE.

974
01:02:12,329 --> 01:02:13,897
RIGHT THIS WAY.

975
01:02:13,897 --> 01:02:15,265
PLEASE.

976
01:02:18,435 --> 01:02:19,836
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW 
THAT THIS IS STEREOTYPING 

977
01:02:19,836 --> 01:02:21,371
OF THE WORST KIND.

978
01:02:21,371 --> 01:02:23,239
SUE ME.

979
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:25,175
BELIEVE ME, 
I'M THINKING ABOUT IT.

980
01:02:25,175 --> 01:02:27,844
RELAX, MARCUS, PLAY THE PART 
AND HAVE SOME FUN.

981
01:02:33,216 --> 01:02:34,584
I'M HERE.

982
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:37,153
YEAH, LISTEN, THIS BITCH
IS HOLDING OUT ON ME,

983
01:02:37,153 --> 01:02:39,522
SO I NEED A ROOM SO I 
CAN TAKE IT OUT IN TRADE.

984
01:02:39,522 --> 01:02:42,258
$25 AN HOUR.

985
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:44,361
IN ADVANCE.

986
01:02:44,361 --> 01:02:45,996
$25 AN--

987
01:02:45,996 --> 01:02:47,998
NIGGER, THAT'S
HIGHWAY ROBBERY.

988
01:02:47,998 --> 01:02:50,900
$25, TAKE IT
OR LEAVE IT.

989
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:53,903
MAYBE WE CAN COME
TO A LITTLE AGREEMENT.

990
01:02:53,903 --> 01:02:56,306
YOU KNOW, COME UP
IN ABOUT AN HOUR.

991
01:02:56,306 --> 01:02:58,475
I'LL LET YOU TEST DRIVE
THIS LITTLE BABY.

992
01:03:07,183 --> 01:03:09,953
SIR, IS 303 AVAILABLE ?

993
01:03:14,891 --> 01:03:16,192
IT'S ON
THE RIGHT SIDE.

994
01:03:16,192 --> 01:03:18,028
AS YOU GO UP
THE STAIRS.

995
01:03:18,028 --> 01:03:20,263
THANK YOU,
YOU'RE AN ANGEL.

996
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:32,342
DAMNIT WOMAN,
THAT SHIT HURT !

997
01:03:32,342 --> 01:03:34,144
OW !

998
01:03:34,344 --> 01:03:35,612
YOU TOLD ME TO
HAVE FUN, RIGHT ?

999
01:03:35,612 --> 01:03:37,247
NOT THAT MUCH FUN.

1000
01:04:11,548 --> 01:04:13,216
YOU SURE THIS
IS GONNA WORK ?

1001
01:04:13,216 --> 01:04:15,285
YEAH, IT'S
GONNA WORK.

1002
01:04:15,285 --> 01:04:17,020
ON CONTACT.

1003
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:18,421
JUST REMEMBER, DON'T TOUCH
IT WITH YOUR FINGERS.

1004
01:04:18,421 --> 01:04:20,623
IT'S A LETHAL NERVE TOXIN,
COMPLETELY FUCK UP YOUR DAY.

1005
01:04:33,603 --> 01:04:35,538
WOMEN AND
POWER TOOLS.

1006
01:04:42,145 --> 01:04:44,047
SHIT.

1007
01:04:44,047 --> 01:04:45,615
WHAT ?

1008
01:04:45,615 --> 01:04:47,217
TURN UP THE RADIO,

1009
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:48,618
WE NEED SOMETHING
TO COVER UP THE NOISE.

1010
01:04:54,157 --> 01:04:54,657
TURN IT UP.

1011
01:04:54,657 --> 01:04:56,092
THAT IS UP.

1012
01:04:56,092 --> 01:04:57,227
ALL THE WAY.

1013
01:04:57,227 --> 01:04:58,995
THAT IS ALL THE WAY.

1014
01:05:01,297 --> 01:05:02,432
JUMP ON THE BED.

1015
01:05:02,432 --> 01:05:03,666
WHAT ?

1016
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:05,602
JUMP ON THE BED.

1017
01:05:05,602 --> 01:05:08,004
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE HERE
TAKING IT OUT IN TRADE,

1018
01:05:08,004 --> 01:05:10,240
SO WHY DON'T YOU ACT LIKE 
YOU'RE REALLY GIVING IT TO ME ?

1019
01:05:11,341 --> 01:05:12,442
THAT'S ALL YOU 
HAD TO SAY.

1020
01:05:24,687 --> 01:05:26,289
YOU LIKE THAT,
RIGHT ?

1021
01:05:27,157 --> 01:05:28,191
ARE YOU GONNA HELP 
ME OUT OR WHAT ?

1022
01:05:29,058 --> 01:05:30,193
OH, YEAH.

1023
01:05:30,193 --> 01:05:30,760
TELL ME YOU LOVE IT.

1024
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:31,261
YEAH !

1025
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:32,996
TELL ME YOU LOVE ME.

1026
01:05:35,165 --> 01:05:36,432
UH, UH, UH.

1027
01:05:39,402 --> 01:05:40,637
DOGGIE STYLE.

1028
01:05:41,538 --> 01:05:42,472
OH, BABY.

1029
01:05:42,472 --> 01:05:44,040
YOU KNOW
I WANT IT.

1030
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:45,975
GIVE IT TO ME, 
BIG DADDY.

1031
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:52,315
BABY.

1032
01:05:55,251 --> 01:05:56,019
ALMOST THERE.

1033
01:05:56,019 --> 01:05:58,421
I'M THERE.

1034
01:05:58,421 --> 01:05:59,022
ALRIGHT.

1035
01:05:59,022 --> 01:06:00,523
ALRIGHT.

1036
01:06:00,523 --> 01:06:02,258
HUH ?

1037
01:06:07,297 --> 01:06:08,565
WAS IT GOOD
FOR YOU ?

1038
01:06:09,699 --> 01:06:11,367
I FAKED IT,
SORRY.

1039
01:06:12,669 --> 01:06:14,470
GIVE ME THE HARNESS
AND THE TOOL BAG.

1040
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:16,272
DON'T YOU WANT TO
HOLD ME FOR A WHILE ?

1041
01:06:23,213 --> 01:06:24,414
JUST BE A MINUTE.

1042
01:06:29,185 --> 01:06:30,687
HOW'S IT LOOK
DOWN THERE ?

1043
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:36,759
ALMOST TO
THE CRAWL SPACE.

1044
01:06:36,759 --> 01:06:38,528
JUST A COUPLE 
MORE FEET.

1045
01:06:38,528 --> 01:06:39,462
OKAY.

1046
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:51,074
ALRIGHT.

1047
01:06:51,074 --> 01:06:52,542
I'M AT
THE CRAWL SPACE.

1048
01:06:53,409 --> 01:06:54,477
UNHOOKING THE HARNESS NOW.

1049
01:06:55,211 --> 01:06:56,145
GOT IT.

1050
01:07:06,556 --> 01:07:07,423
HEY, JORDO.

1051
01:07:09,592 --> 01:07:11,527
MY FRIEND LESTER.

1052
01:07:11,527 --> 01:07:13,162
HOW YOU DOING ?

1053
01:07:15,598 --> 01:07:17,834
WE GO WAY BACK,
ME AND HIM.

1054
01:07:17,834 --> 01:07:20,470
MAYBE TOO FAR.

1055
01:07:21,237 --> 01:07:22,872
SO, YOUR FRIEND HERE
BEATS THE CRAP OUT OF ME

1056
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:25,174
UNTIL I TELL YOU
WHAT YOU WANT TO KNOW.

1057
01:07:25,775 --> 01:07:27,810
NO, THAT'S MY JOB.

1058
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:34,417
I'M OPPOSED
TO VIOLENCE.

1059
01:07:35,818 --> 01:07:37,153
THAT'S TRUE.

1060
01:07:37,153 --> 01:07:40,056
ACTUALLY,
HE'S A CHEMIST.

1061
01:07:52,235 --> 01:07:54,070
HAVE YOU EVER
DONE ANY DRUGS ?

1062
01:07:58,308 --> 01:07:59,542
OCCASIONALLY.

1063
01:07:59,542 --> 01:08:02,512
SMOKED A JOINT ONCE
IN A BLUE MOON.

1064
01:08:02,512 --> 01:08:03,780
I EVEN INHALED.

1065
01:08:05,148 --> 01:08:08,418
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
BETWEEN ME AND YOU,

1066
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:09,452
THIS AIN'T
PERSONAL.

1067
01:08:11,854 --> 01:08:13,856
I THINK YOUR SHOW'S 
ONE OF THE WORST FORUMS 

1068
01:08:13,856 --> 01:08:15,725
ON THE AIR 
AT THIS TIME.

1069
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:20,830
IN ABOUT
THREE MINUTES

1070
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:22,398
YOU'RE GONNA
FEEL REALLY GOOD.

1071
01:08:22,398 --> 01:08:24,300
SO GOOD, IN FACT,

1072
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:25,635
THAT YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME
EVERYTHING THAT I WANT TO KNOW.

1073
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:29,305
INCLUDING WHATEVER IN
THE HELL IS A BLUE MOON.

1074
01:09:43,646 --> 01:09:45,648
WORKED LIKE
A CHARM.

1075
01:09:45,648 --> 01:09:47,517
I TOLD YOU
IT WOULD.

1076
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:49,485
NOW, WHAT'S THE LESSON
WE'VE LEARNED HERE TODAY ?

1077
01:09:49,485 --> 01:09:51,587
MARCUS IS
ALWAYS RIGHT.

1078
01:09:51,587 --> 01:09:53,489
THERE YOU GO.

1079
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:55,525
ALRIGHT, I'M GOING IN.

1080
01:10:06,836 --> 01:10:08,604
ALRIGHT,
TALK TO ME.

1081
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:13,543
HOW'S THE VIEW ?

1082
01:10:16,412 --> 01:10:17,780
SPECTACULAR.

1083
01:10:18,681 --> 01:10:20,783
THAT'S THE ZF-99 !

1084
01:10:20,783 --> 01:10:22,718
I'D KILL FOR 
ONE OF THOSE.

1085
01:10:22,718 --> 01:10:24,887
MARCUS, WOULD YOU JUST GET ME IN
SO I CAN GET THE HELL OUT.

1086
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:26,489
AH, RIGHT...

1087
01:10:26,489 --> 01:10:28,491
OKAY.

1088
01:10:28,858 --> 01:10:30,626
FIRST THING'S FIRST IS TO 
LOAD THE DISK I GAVE YOU.

1089
01:10:32,929 --> 01:10:34,564
AND THEN ?

1090
01:10:34,564 --> 01:10:36,666
ONE THING AT A TIME, 
ONE THING AT A TIME.

1091
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:40,369
YOU KNOW, I JUST
GOTTA SAY

1092
01:10:40,369 --> 01:10:42,839
THAT YOU'RE BEING A LOT LESS
THAN COOPERATIVE HERE.

1093
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:45,942
I'M DOING
THE BEST I CAN.

1094
01:10:45,942 --> 01:10:48,544
ALWAYS DO
YOUR VERY BEST.

1095
01:10:48,544 --> 01:10:51,714
THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING.

1096
01:10:54,817 --> 01:10:57,353
WELL, YOU KNOW
YOUR BEST

1097
01:10:57,353 --> 01:11:00,256
JUST AIN'T GETTING
THERE FOR ME, MY FRIEND.

1098
01:11:04,727 --> 01:11:06,462
I'M GONNA
ASK YOU AGAIN.

1099
01:11:06,462 --> 01:11:08,498
ONE MORE TIME.

1100
01:11:08,498 --> 01:11:09,866
WHERE IS SHE ?

1101
01:11:09,866 --> 01:11:12,635
SHE DIDN'T
TELL ME ANYTHING.

1102
01:11:14,804 --> 01:11:17,039
JORDON.

1103
01:11:20,776 --> 01:11:22,745
WHAT AM I GONNA
DO WITH YOU ?

1104
01:11:24,814 --> 01:11:26,516
GETTING READY TO 
GIVE YOU A SMACK.

1105
01:11:26,516 --> 01:11:29,352
HAVE SOME
PATIENCE.

1106
01:11:29,352 --> 01:11:32,321
HOW IS THAT GONNA HELP
YOU ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING ?

1107
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:47,036
HERE IT IS,
DIRECTIVE SEVEN.

1108
01:11:47,036 --> 01:11:50,606
Alright, get the helicopter
file and let's go.

1109
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:55,478
I'M LOOKING FOR IT, WAIT...

1110
01:11:59,849 --> 01:12:01,017
HE DOESN'T
KNOW NOTHING.

1111
01:12:01,017 --> 01:12:03,519
HE KNOWS ENOUGH.

1112
01:12:05,821 --> 01:12:07,857
GET LESTER
BACK IN HERE.

1113
01:12:07,857 --> 01:12:09,125
YOU KNOW HOW LESTER
FEELS ABOUT BLOOD.

1114
01:12:09,125 --> 01:12:10,927
GO GET HIM !

1115
01:12:10,927 --> 01:12:11,561
OKAY.

1116
01:12:11,561 --> 01:12:12,662
OKAY.

1117
01:12:13,863 --> 01:12:15,831
MARCUS.

1118
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:19,135
THIS IS IT,
YOU GOT IT ?

1119
01:12:19,135 --> 01:12:21,103
YEAH, I DO.

1120
01:12:21,103 --> 01:12:23,739
JESUS, THIS
IS INCREDIBLE.

1121
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:25,875
YEAH, IT IS.

1122
01:12:26,576 --> 01:12:27,777
LOOK, LET'S GET
YOU OUT OF THERE

1123
01:12:27,777 --> 01:12:28,644
AND WORRY ABOUT
THIS LATER.

1124
01:12:28,644 --> 01:12:30,513
I'M DROPPING 
A RED FLAG IN THE SYSTEM.

1125
01:12:35,852 --> 01:12:37,119
HEY.

1126
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:39,889
YOU WANT TO SEE
YOUR DAUGHTER AGAIN,

1127
01:12:39,889 --> 01:12:41,591
I PRESUME ?

1128
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:44,861
THAT'LL BE GOOD
FOR EVERYONE, RIGHT.

1129
01:12:44,861 --> 01:12:45,561
YEAH.

1130
01:12:45,561 --> 01:12:47,029
YEAH.

1131
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:48,631
YES.

1132
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:51,968
WHAT'S HER
NAME AGAIN ?

1133
01:12:51,968 --> 01:12:53,803
BAILEY.

1134
01:12:53,803 --> 01:12:55,638
BAILEY, RIGHT, YEAH.

1135
01:12:58,174 --> 01:13:00,142
I'M GETTING A LITTLE 
TIRED OF YOU.

1136
01:13:00,142 --> 01:13:03,512
LESTER HERE IS GONNA
GIVE YOU ANOTHER SHOT.

1137
01:13:03,512 --> 01:13:06,949
BUT THIS ONE'S KIND
OF DIFFERENT

1138
01:13:06,949 --> 01:13:08,985
IT'S GONNA MESS 
UP YOUR BRAIN...

1139
01:13:08,985 --> 01:13:10,953
REALLY BAD.

1140
01:13:10,953 --> 01:13:12,655
SO BAD YOU WON'T
RECOGNIZE ANYBODY.

1141
01:13:12,655 --> 01:13:14,724
NO MATTER
WHO THEY ARE.

1142
01:13:14,724 --> 01:13:17,193
YOU MIGHT NOT RECOGNIZE
YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR.

1143
01:13:17,193 --> 01:13:18,728
( phone )

1144
01:13:21,931 --> 01:13:24,467
HOLMAN HERE.

1145
01:13:24,467 --> 01:13:26,636
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

1146
01:13:26,636 --> 01:13:29,639
WE HAVE A SECURITY BREACH
IN THE COMPUTER ROOM.

1147
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:32,675
LET'S GO.

1148
01:13:36,812 --> 01:13:38,114
GIVE HIM THE SHOT.

1149
01:13:46,522 --> 01:13:47,657
( gunshot )

1150
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:58,134
C'MON, GET UP.

1151
01:13:58,134 --> 01:13:59,568
YOU HAVE TO.

1152
01:13:59,568 --> 01:14:00,803
WE DON'T
HAVE MUCH TIME.

1153
01:14:11,981 --> 01:14:14,483
TRY AND LIFT YOURSELF UP.

1154
01:14:17,987 --> 01:14:19,989
WELL, WELL, WELL.

1155
01:14:19,989 --> 01:14:22,692
A LITTLE AMBITIOUS,
AREN'T WE ?

1156
01:14:25,061 --> 01:14:27,697
YOU MADE
A MIRACULOUS
RECOVERY.

1157
01:14:27,697 --> 01:14:29,165
YOU LOOK
GOOD, HONEY.

1158
01:14:29,165 --> 01:14:30,800
GOOD HAIR.

1159
01:14:35,638 --> 01:14:36,906
DID YOU
DO THAT ?

1160
01:14:38,074 --> 01:14:40,142
LESTER NEVER
HURT ANYBODY.

1161
01:14:42,111 --> 01:14:43,979
GET HIM
OUT OF HERE !

1162
01:14:43,979 --> 01:14:45,514
GET HIM OUT.

1163
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:47,016
BRING THE OLD
MAN BACK.

1164
01:14:48,951 --> 01:14:49,986
PUT YOUR HANDS
ON YOUR HEAD.

1165
01:14:52,922 --> 01:14:54,056
DO IT.

1166
01:15:02,031 --> 01:15:02,999
THAT'S BETTER.

1167
01:15:08,204 --> 01:15:09,939
YOU LOOK
MARVELOUS.

1168
01:15:12,208 --> 01:15:13,843
THAT'S CUTE.

1169
01:15:19,014 --> 01:15:20,916
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD
HAVE STUCK WITH ME

1170
01:15:20,916 --> 01:15:23,185
AND EVERYTHING
WOULD'VE BEEN ALRIGHT.

1171
01:15:26,055 --> 01:15:28,758
LET'S SEE WHO
YOU'RE LISTENING TO.

1172
01:15:33,796 --> 01:15:34,897
HUH.

1173
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:37,032
WHAT DO YOU
GOT FOR ME ?

1174
01:15:39,635 --> 01:15:43,005
HMM, C'MON.

1175
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:46,542
GETTIN' A LITTLE
WORKED UP ?

1176
01:15:47,043 --> 01:15:48,844
WHY WOULD I
DO THAT NOW ?

1177
01:15:51,714 --> 01:15:53,015
YOU KNOW...

1178
01:15:53,015 --> 01:15:55,050
I THINK I'M GONNA
MISS YOU A LITTLE BIT.

1179
01:15:55,885 --> 01:15:56,852
I WON'T.

1180
01:16:18,307 --> 01:16:19,809
FUCK YOU.

1181
01:16:21,377 --> 01:16:24,580
DID SHE TELL YOU THAT 
SHE ALMOST KILLED YOU ?

1182
01:16:25,214 --> 01:16:27,049
DID YOU
TELL HIM THAT ?

1183
01:16:27,049 --> 01:16:29,018
HE KNOWS.

1184
01:16:29,018 --> 01:16:33,389
I'M ALMOST SORRY THAT
YOU DIDN'T GET AWAY.

1185
01:16:33,389 --> 01:16:35,391
I BET.

1186
01:16:35,391 --> 01:16:36,926
IT WOULD HAVE
BEEN NICE KNOWING

1187
01:16:36,926 --> 01:16:38,194
THAT YOU WERE OUT
THERE SOMEWHERE.

1188
01:16:38,194 --> 01:16:41,697
LIKE YOU WOULD HAVE JUST
LEFT ME OUT THERE.

1189
01:16:41,697 --> 01:16:44,033
I LIKE TO THINK YOU
WOULD HAVE DONE

1190
01:16:44,033 --> 01:16:46,268
THE SAME FOR ME.

1191
01:17:01,016 --> 01:17:02,384
PLEASE, DON'T
ANYBODY GET UP.

1192
01:17:05,187 --> 01:17:06,455
MR. MCNAMARA.

1193
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:08,090
HUGE FAN.

1194
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:12,094
SO, WE HAD TO MEET 
UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES.

1195
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:17,700
YOU KNOW, I'M JUST 
YOUR AVERAGE "JOHN Q. PUBLIC".

1196
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:19,468
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU WOULD
HAVE BEEN BETTER SERVED TO STICK

1197
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:21,737
WITH THE STORIES ABOUT
SUPERMARKETS AND TAINTED BEEF.

1198
01:17:23,205 --> 01:17:24,840
BUT WHAT
DO I KNOW ?

1199
01:17:26,175 --> 01:17:28,177
AND YOU,
MY LITTLE PRETTY.

1200
01:17:28,177 --> 01:17:30,446
TAXPAYERS HAVE RACKED UP
A PRETTY GOOD BILL

1201
01:17:30,446 --> 01:17:32,281
TRAINING YOU.

1202
01:17:32,281 --> 01:17:36,185
WHATEVER GAVE YOU THE IDEA YOU
COULD TAKE EARLY RETIREMENT ?

1203
01:17:36,185 --> 01:17:39,455
I TOOK THE FOUR MEN YOU SENT OUT
AS A PINK SLIP THIS MORNING.

1204
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:43,058
DOWNSIZING.

1205
01:17:43,058 --> 01:17:45,928
FACT OF LIFE
IN THE 90s.

1206
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:49,498
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
WITH MY DAUGHTER ?

1207
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:53,235
YOU SEE, THAT'S THE PROBLEM
WITH YOU BRETHREN OF THE MEDIA.

1208
01:17:53,235 --> 01:17:55,137
YOU ALWAYS THINK
YOU'RE ENTITLED

1209
01:17:55,137 --> 01:17:57,206
TO HAVE ALL
THE INFORMATION.

1210
01:17:57,206 --> 01:18:02,311
THAT SIX-YEAR-OLD CHILD
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.

1211
01:18:02,311 --> 01:18:06,182
WELL, YOU GOT ME THERE.

1212
01:18:06,182 --> 01:18:08,217
SHE'S SAFE.

1213
01:18:08,217 --> 01:18:12,488
SHE'S IN A HOTEL
BY JFK, THE COSMOPOLITAN.

1214
01:18:12,488 --> 01:18:15,057
VERY NICE SUITE.

1215
01:18:15,057 --> 01:18:18,027
ANY FURTHER
QUESTIONS ?

1216
01:18:18,961 --> 01:18:21,697
THIS IS YOUR BIG CHANCE FOR 
YOUR LAST INTERVIEW, MCNAMARA.

1217
01:18:28,170 --> 01:18:30,973
WHAT-- YEAH, 
I HAVE A QUESTION.

1218
01:18:30,973 --> 01:18:34,143
WHY ARE YOU
KILLING ME ?

1219
01:18:34,143 --> 01:18:37,713
BEFORE I DIE, WOULD YOU
JUST TELL ME WHY ?

1220
01:18:38,914 --> 01:18:39,982
WHY ANY OF THIS ?

1221
01:18:40,916 --> 01:18:42,384
THOMAS ETELAND.

1222
01:18:42,384 --> 01:18:45,354
WHY WOULD YOU 
KILL THOMAS ETELAND ?

1223
01:18:45,354 --> 01:18:48,290
OH, I DIDN'T
KILL HIM, SHE DID.

1224
01:18:48,290 --> 01:18:49,391
ON YOUR ORDERS.

1225
01:18:49,391 --> 01:18:50,392
C'MON, PLEASE.

1226
01:18:50,392 --> 01:18:51,994
PLEASE.

1227
01:18:51,994 --> 01:18:53,295
HE HAD A
LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.

1228
01:18:53,295 --> 01:18:56,165
THAT'S A
DANGEROUS THING.

1229
01:18:56,165 --> 01:18:57,967
MEANING, I SUPPOSE, 
THAT HE KNEW ABOUT THE ATTACK 

1230
01:18:57,967 --> 01:19:00,336
ON THE ARMY HELICOPTERS 
THAT YOU STAGED IN ARIZONA.

1231
01:19:01,537 --> 01:19:02,972
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

1232
01:19:02,972 --> 01:19:05,040
WHY WOULD YOU KILL
AMERICAN SOLDIERS ?

1233
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:07,142
WHY ?

1234
01:19:07,142 --> 01:19:10,112
YOU KNOW, THIS PROBABLY
COMES AS NO SURPRISE

1235
01:19:10,112 --> 01:19:12,314
TO A JOURNALIST
OF YOUR CALIBER,

1236
01:19:12,314 --> 01:19:16,185
BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE
A GROWING CONCERN

1237
01:19:16,185 --> 01:19:18,220
IN THIS COUNTRY AGAINST
DOMESTIC TERRORISM.

1238
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:21,190
ANTHRAX SCARES, 
MILITIA GROUPS, 

1239
01:19:21,190 --> 01:19:24,326
WORLD TRADE CENTER
OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBINGS,

1240
01:19:24,326 --> 01:19:26,862
THINGS OF THAT NATURE.

1241
01:19:28,364 --> 01:19:30,265
WE THOUGHT WE COULD USE
THESE THREATS TO OUR ADVANTAGE.

1242
01:19:30,265 --> 01:19:33,302
THAT THESE TYPES
OF INCIDENTS,

1243
01:19:33,302 --> 01:19:37,272
AS TRAGIC AS
THEY REALLY ARE,

1244
01:19:37,272 --> 01:19:41,310
WOULD SERVE TO BOLSTER
THE PUBLIC OUTCRY.

1245
01:19:41,310 --> 01:19:44,313
WHICH WOULD IN TURN GET OUR
FUNDING BACK UP TO THE LEVEL

1246
01:19:44,313 --> 01:19:46,181
WHERE IT SHOULD BE.

1247
01:19:47,149 --> 01:19:49,184
AND ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS
KILL INNOCENT PEOPLE.

1248
01:19:50,886 --> 01:19:54,390
WELL, IF A COUPLE OF
PEOPLE HAVE TO DIE, IT'S--

1249
01:19:54,390 --> 01:19:56,025
( phone )

1250
01:20:00,396 --> 01:20:02,264
HOLMAN HERE.

1251
01:20:02,264 --> 01:20:03,866
COULD THIS WAIT, PLEASE ?

1252
01:20:03,866 --> 01:20:05,234
WE'RE IN
THE MIDDLE
OF SOMETHING.

1253
01:20:05,234 --> 01:20:06,568
MANY BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN
HAVE GIVEN THEIR LIVES

1254
01:20:06,568 --> 01:20:07,469
TO A COUNTRY WHO HAS
TURNED ITS BACK ON THEM.

1255
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:10,472
I JUST COULDN'T SIT B

1256
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:12,174
AND LET THAT
CONTINUE TO HAPPEN.

1257
01:20:13,308 --> 01:20:15,044
WELL, YOU KNOW...

1258
01:20:15,044 --> 01:20:17,546
YOU'RE WORSE THAN ANYONE 
YOU CLAIM TO BE FIGHTING.

1259
01:20:18,447 --> 01:20:20,082
OH, REALLY.

1260
01:20:20,082 --> 01:20:23,085
AND HAVE YOU EVER LOOKED
A TERRORIST IN THE EYE,

1261
01:20:23,085 --> 01:20:24,386
MR. MCNAMARA ?

1262
01:20:24,386 --> 01:20:26,221
I HAVE NOW.

1263
01:20:27,222 --> 01:20:29,091
OH, DON'T KID
YOURSELF.

1264
01:20:29,091 --> 01:20:30,292
BRING DOWN
A COUPLE OF CHOPPERS.

1265
01:20:30,292 --> 01:20:32,961
SNUFF OUT
A NOSY FANATIC.

1266
01:20:32,961 --> 01:20:34,296
THAT DOESN'T PUT ME
IN THE LEAGUE

1267
01:20:34,296 --> 01:20:35,164
WITH THE HEZBOLAH.

1268
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:36,298
EXCUSE ME, SIR,
I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

1269
01:20:36,298 --> 01:20:38,300
WHAT ?!

1270
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:40,302
THAT WAS JUST 
MEDIA SURVEILLANCE.

1271
01:20:40,302 --> 01:20:43,272
THEY SUGGESTED THAT WE 
TURN ON THE TELEVISION.

1272
01:20:44,039 --> 01:20:45,507
 WWZN.

1273
01:20:48,043 --> 01:20:49,311
YES, SIR.

1274
01:20:53,916 --> 01:20:56,352
AND SO, FROM THE FACE OF 
THE 52-03 ARGYLE STREET, 

1275
01:20:56,352 --> 01:20:59,321
HEADQUARTERS OF 
ALPHA SECTION

1276
01:20:59,321 --> 01:21:01,490
A ROGUE COUNTER-TERRORIST AGENCY
OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT.

1277
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:12,067
THIS IS JORDAN MCNAMARA,
REPORTING LIVE.

1278
01:21:24,646 --> 01:21:25,514
MR. HOLMAN.

1279
01:21:25,514 --> 01:21:26,648
YES, SIR.

1280
01:21:26,648 --> 01:21:28,550
MAY I PLEASE
HAVE YOUR SIDEARM ?

1281
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:34,089
PLEASE MAKE SURE
A CAR IS STANDING BY

1282
01:21:34,089 --> 01:21:36,225
FOR MR. DALTON
AND MYSELF.

1283
01:21:37,059 --> 01:21:38,293
YES, SIR.

1284
01:21:40,362 --> 01:21:42,064
THIS IS YOUR
OWN DOING.

1285
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:45,968
CONGRATULATIONS.

1286
01:21:56,378 --> 01:21:57,079

1287
01:21:58,380 --> 01:21:59,515

SHOOT HER !

1289
01:22:00,449 --> 01:22:02,384
HOLD YOUR FIRE !

1290
01:22:04,353 --> 01:22:06,088
SHOOT HER !

1291
01:22:06,088 --> 01:22:07,523
YOU REALLY WANT TO 
DIE FOR THESE GUYS, 

1292
01:22:07,523 --> 01:22:08,657
I DON'T THINK THEY 
GIVE A SHIT ABOUT YOU.

1293
01:22:17,599 --> 01:22:19,134
OKAY.

1294
01:22:21,069 --> 01:22:22,171
C'MON.

1295
01:22:22,671 --> 01:22:24,006
LET'S GO.

1296
01:22:30,078 --> 01:22:31,547
MOVE IT.

1297
01:22:32,481 --> 01:22:33,515
WE HAVE
A SITUATION HERE.

1298
01:22:33,515 --> 01:22:35,083
EVERYBODY
JUST STAY COOL.

1299
01:22:41,523 --> 01:22:43,358
SHOOT HER !

1300
01:22:43,358 --> 01:22:45,360
HOLD YOUR FIRE !

1301
01:22:49,331 --> 01:22:51,033
SOMEBODY SHOOT
THAT BITCH.

1302
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:52,434
DON'T EVEN
THINK ABOUT IT.

1303
01:23:28,170 --> 01:23:29,204
C'MON, GO !

1304
01:23:41,183 --> 01:23:42,417
FUCK !

1305
01:23:50,626 --> 01:23:52,461
WHERE THE FUCK
IS MY CAR ?

1306
01:23:52,461 --> 01:23:53,362
IT'S WAITING OUTSIDE, SIR.

1307
01:23:53,362 --> 01:23:55,697
WHAT THE HELL IS 
GOING ON IN THERE ?

1308
01:23:55,697 --> 01:23:57,199
WHAT DO YOU THINK ?

1309
01:23:57,199 --> 01:23:58,066
GIVE ME THAT.

1310
01:24:37,372 --> 01:24:38,874
HEY, HONEY.

1311
01:24:38,874 --> 01:24:41,576
I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT YOU,

1312
01:24:41,576 --> 01:24:44,513
BUT I'M HAVING
A GREAT TIME.

1313
01:24:47,582 --> 01:24:49,151
WHY DON'T YOU COME OUT
WHERE I CAN SEE YOU ?

1314
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:05,200
YOU KNOW...

1315
01:25:06,201 --> 01:25:07,469
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
DID WHAT YOU DID.

1316
01:25:08,870 --> 01:25:10,405
I MUST SAY...

1317
01:25:10,405 --> 01:25:11,640
I DIDN'T THINK
YOU HAD IT IN YOU.

1318
01:25:12,574 --> 01:25:13,775
NO ?

1319
01:27:02,951 --> 01:27:04,686
ABOUT DAMN TIME 
YOU WOKE UP.

1320
01:27:08,990 --> 01:27:10,726
HOW LONG HAVE
YOU BEEN HERE ?

1321
01:27:10,726 --> 01:27:11,993
LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW
THAT CHAIR OVER THERE

1322
01:27:11,993 --> 01:27:13,528
WAS NOT DESIGNED
FOR COMFORT.

1323
01:27:16,998 --> 01:27:18,567
WHERE IS...

1324
01:27:18,567 --> 01:27:21,303
NO, I WOULDN'T EVEN TELL YOU
EVEN IF I DID KNOW.

1325
01:27:22,304 --> 01:27:23,805
BUT YOU KNOW...

1326
01:27:23,805 --> 01:27:24,940
YEAH.

1327
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:26,408
I DO.

1328
01:27:26,408 --> 01:27:28,643
STILL NOT GONNA TELL YOU.

1329
01:27:35,851 --> 01:27:37,319
SO...

1330
01:27:37,319 --> 01:27:38,587
QUESTION ?

1331
01:27:39,354 --> 01:27:40,755
THE BROADCAST.

1332
01:27:40,755 --> 01:27:41,890
HOW ?

1333
01:27:41,890 --> 01:27:42,991
EASY.

1334
01:27:42,991 --> 01:27:44,993
LIVE FEED.

1335
01:27:44,993 --> 01:27:46,828
YEAH, BUT HOW'D YOU GET 
IT PAST MY PRODUCER ?

1336
01:27:48,029 --> 01:27:49,831
YOUR PRODUCER
HAD NO CHOICE.

1337
01:27:49,831 --> 01:27:52,000
I INTERRUPTED HIS REGULARLY
SCHEDULED PROGRAMMING.

1338
01:27:56,338 --> 01:28:00,041
SO, THE INVISIBLE MAN
STRIKES AGAIN.

1339
01:28:02,677 --> 01:28:04,379
I KNEW IT
LAST NIGHT.

1340
01:28:04,379 --> 01:28:07,048
IT'S STILL KIND OF 
HARD TO BELIEVE THOUGH.

1341
01:28:07,883 --> 01:28:09,084
WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU EXPECT ?

1342
01:28:09,084 --> 01:28:10,685
SOME PIMPLE-FACED
WHITE BOY

1343
01:28:10,685 --> 01:28:12,687
WITH COKE BOTTLE GLASSES
AND A POCKET PROTECTOR ?

1344
01:28:12,687 --> 01:28:14,523
YEAH.

1345
01:28:18,026 --> 01:28:19,661
SO THANKS.

1346
01:28:19,661 --> 01:28:21,363
FOR WHAT ?

1347
01:28:21,363 --> 01:28:23,331
FOR ALLOWING ME TO
BE A REPORTER AGAIN.

1348
01:28:24,799 --> 01:28:27,769
I SEEM TO REMEMBER IT BEING
A WHOLE LOT EASIER THAN THIS.

1349
01:28:31,406 --> 01:28:33,375
WHERE WILL
SHE GO ?

1350
01:28:33,375 --> 01:28:36,745
MAN, DON'T MAKE ME
HAVE TO HURT YOU.

1351
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:39,748
NOT ON THE
LEFT SIDE, OKAY ?

1352
01:28:42,384 --> 01:28:42,984
TELL ME SOMETHING.

1353
01:28:42,984 --> 01:28:44,519
WHAT'S UP ?

1354
01:28:44,519 --> 01:28:47,756
HOW'D YOU BREAK INTO
THE WHITE HOUSE COMPUTER ?

1355
01:28:47,756 --> 01:28:48,990
SIMPLE.

1356
01:28:48,990 --> 01:28:50,759
I SAID
I WAS AL GORE.
