00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:57,768
- [sniffles]
- Someone to think about?

175
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:04,233
- A mama?
- [Tomas shudders]

176
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,319
Then remember…

177
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:12,281
This is just work.

178
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:17,746
Same as you always done. Just work.

179
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:21,124
[flies buzzing]

180
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,502
- God is with us.
- [breathes shakily]

181
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:29,174
How can you say that to him?

182
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:33,136
"God is with us."

183
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:39,351
[stammering]
Wh-Where... Where... Where is he?

184
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:47,025
And why has he not set you free? Hmm?

185
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:49,987
Or has he?

186
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:56,201
Oh. So... So you...
You are... are not in these?

187
00:17:58,829 --> 00:17:59,872
Well, then stand up…

188
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,418
Stand up… [breathing heavily]
…G-Go. Stand up.

189
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:08,881
Stand up, a-and praise your God
for all he has done for you,

190
00:18:08,964 --> 00:18:10,966
for-for-for-for all of us.

191
00:18:12,718 --> 00:18:15,637
[breathing shakily]

192
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:21,810
You. [breathes shakily]

193
00:18:23,562 --> 00:18:25,397
God is not with you.

194
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:28,984
He is nowhere. [breathing shakily]

195
00:18:30,986 --> 00:18:35,032
And he sends that fool to...
To tell us about his word.

196
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:38,577
To-To be a good slave.

197
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:42,539
To-To-To-To-To be obedient
to your masters.

198
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:51,423
Is that what God says to you? [sniffles]

199
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,635
[Peter] God says many things…

200
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,180
I do not know why…

201
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:06,813
God shows himself to some people
and not to others…

202
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:12,361
But if you do not know him…

203
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:21,787
I will pray for you.

204
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:25,249
[breathing heavily]

205
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:30,170
[priest] Matthew 17:20 says
that you can move a mountain.

206
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:34,049
But faith without work is dead. Faith!

207
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,718
It's okay to work and die for your master.

208
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:42,766
- Faith is obedience. Be obedient.
- [laborer] Come on down. Hold it, hold it.

209
00:19:43,976 --> 00:19:45,811
Bring it down. All right, all right. Yeah.

210
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:49,523
- [priest] Faith. Give unto the Lord…
- [laborer] All right. Keep moving.

211
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:51,608
There we go. Up, up.

212
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,945
[priest] …Give unto the Lord the glory…

213
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:58,115
[laborer]
Look alive. Look alive. Okay. All right.

214
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:00,576
[Tomas panting]

215
00:20:02,411 --> 00:20:03,829
[grunts]

216
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:08,458
Steady yourself. Long day out here.

217
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,546
Water break!

218
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:19,928
Not you. Not you.

219
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:23,599
[cannon fires]

220
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,101
Not you.

221
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:29,438
[priest] Book of Timothy teaches us,

222
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:36,570
"All who's under the yoke of slavery
should consider their masters worthy,

223
00:20:37,446 --> 00:20:38,989
worthy of respect."

224
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:41,408
You, you. Water.

225
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:42,826
[Peter sighs]

226
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,536
[priest] Book of Timothy teaches us,

227
00:20:45,204 --> 00:20:50,626
"All who's under the yoke of slavery,
should consider your master worthy,

228
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:53,962
worthy of respect"…

229
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,965
- [blows]
- [priest] …Worthy.

230
00:21:00,344 --> 00:21:01,470
Worthy.

231
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,973
[army engineer] Clear!

232
00:21:05,057 --> 00:21:07,684
[soldiers]
Clear! Let's go! Let's move! Move!

233
00:21:12,856 --> 00:21:15,150
- [sergeant] Back to work.
- [soldiers, laborers coughing]

234
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:24,535
[sergeant]
"And God has revealed his very will to me.

235
00:21:26,245 --> 00:21:29,081
And so, I issue Proclamation 95."

236
00:21:30,582 --> 00:21:31,792
What the hell's that mean?

237
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,836
[sighs] Lincoln freed the slaves.

238
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,420
What?

239
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:39,174
[sergeant] Lincoln freed the slaves.

240
00:21:40,676 --> 00:21:43,178
Get on, boy.
Fetch us a couple tins of water.

241
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:48,934
[sergeant groans] Desperate man, Lincoln.

242
00:21:49,685 --> 00:21:53,063
You know, according to one of these other
papers from a couple weeks back,

243
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:56,024
slaves are running to Baton Rouge
from every direction

244
00:21:56,108 --> 00:21:57,526
now that Grant holds the town.

245
00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:01,405
Fixing for liberty. One and all.

246
00:22:02,614 --> 00:22:04,283
[spits, groans]

247
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:07,160
- Matter with you?
- [breathes heavily]

248
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:12,291
Nigger put something in my stew.

249
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:16,170
And the damn corn pone's rotted out!

250
00:22:17,129 --> 00:22:20,090
Damn you, son of a bitch.
You put something in my stew, nigger?

251
00:22:20,174 --> 00:22:21,216
[soldier laughing]

252
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:25,804
What y'all looking at? Get back to work.

253
00:22:25,888 --> 00:22:27,139
[laughing]

254
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:30,267
[sergeant groans]
What you put in my stew? [spits]

255
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:37,733
What, now you gonna eyeball me again, boy?
Get over here. Get over here!

256
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,784
You gone crazy from the heat, boy? Hmm?

257
00:22:50,037 --> 00:22:51,330
He is just a child.

Boy must have a death wish. Hmm?

261
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:13,185
[whistles]

262
00:23:14,228 --> 00:23:15,229
What?

263
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,444
[inhales deeply]

264
00:23:23,028 --> 00:23:24,112
[soldier] Back to work.

265
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:26,240
[sergeant] Go!

[Fassel] I'm your God.

273
00:24:20,252 --> 00:24:22,421
You walk the Earth because I let you.

274
00:24:25,424 --> 00:24:26,758
You're my dog now.

275
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:36,101
Perhaps you will give me some of that
fine meat you give your other dog.

276
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:40,022
[laughs]

277
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:46,987
You're funny now, big stick.

278
00:24:49,156 --> 00:24:50,157
You'll see.

279
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:13,639
Come on. Hurry up.

280

[officer] One, two, three, four! One!

282
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:20,979
Hey, keep moving.

- [officer] One, two, three, four!
- He's a dead man.

284
00:25:27,903 --> 00:25:28,987
No.

285
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:32,574
- [breathing heavily]
- [Fassel] You miss your family?

286
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:39,289

- [Peter] I heard it myself.
- [guard 2] Back it up!

291
00:25:55,514 --> 00:25:56,932
Slaves are free.

Lincoln. We must get to Baton Rouge.
Lincoln's army is there.

296
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:14,950
It's true. I heard it also.

[guard 3] Bring it up! Let's go.

298

Five days through the swamp.

300
00:26:27,421 --> 00:26:30,340
There are many ways to die in a swamp.

301
00:26:30,424 --> 00:26:32,384
There are many ways to die here.

302
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:36,180

[sidekick grunts]

538
00:50:39,998 --> 00:50:42,584
[sidekick 2 grunts] Look like he knew
right where to do him, too.

539
00:50:43,836 --> 00:50:47,339
[sidekick] Ain't no way that boy
got away from this thing. [grunts]

540
00:50:49,883 --> 00:50:50,884
[both grunting]

541
00:50:52,052 --> 00:50:53,846

- Open her up.

542
00:50:54,805 --> 00:50:57,766
[panting]

543
00:51:17,286 --> 00:51:19,872
- [sidekick grunting]
- [sidekick 2] Ain't nothin' in him.

544
00:51:32,134 --> 00:51:33,135
[sniffs]

545
00:51:35,971 --> 00:51:39,433
Ah, yeah… [sighs] …look at that.

546
00:51:40,225 --> 00:51:42,102
Our boy fixed a gator. [chuckles]

547
00:51:45,022 --> 00:51:46,273
[sidekick laughs]

548
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:56,575
How in the hell does an ignorant nigger
got knowledge like that?

549
00:51:56,658 --> 00:51:58,827
You're the ignorant one
thinking like that.

550
00:52:02,831 --> 00:52:05,626
My father was a corn husker…

551
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,589
My mother passed when I was young, so…

552
00:52:12,508 --> 00:52:16,261
the job of raising me
fell on our nigger house girl.

553
00:52:16,762 --> 00:52:18,388
She took care of me. [grunts]

554
00:52:19,473 --> 00:52:24,728
She fed me. She washed me.
She taught me things…

555
00:52:26,688 --> 00:52:27,773
She was my friend.

556
00:52:32,986 --> 00:52:34,071
One evening…

557
00:52:37,282 --> 00:52:41,787
I asked my father
if she could join us for supper,

558
00:52:44,623 --> 00:52:48,043
and he looked at me in a funny way
and said, "Then what?"

559
00:52:49,127 --> 00:52:54,258
I said, "So we could eat together,"
to which he asked, "Then what?"

560
00:52:57,845 --> 00:53:01,640
I didn't know, I was just a boy.
But he did.

561
00:53:04,393 --> 00:53:05,394
He said…

562
00:53:09,314 --> 00:53:10,440
[blows]

563
00:53:11,233 --> 00:53:12,734
…"First, they eat our food,

564
00:53:14,152 --> 00:53:18,240
then they'll take our jobs
and then they'll steal our land.

565
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,952
We give the nigger so much as a crumb,

566
00:53:22,035 --> 00:53:24,329
they're going to take over
the whole damn country."

567
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:30,878
I was so ashamed. [stammers] I…

568
00:53:33,297 --> 00:53:38,051
I told him I'd been sneaking her food
when she was hungry.

569
00:53:41,847 --> 00:53:43,223
He got real quiet…

570
00:53:44,975 --> 00:53:50,272
Called her into the dining room,
picked up a dinner knife and…

571
00:53:52,524 --> 00:53:53,650
fixed her right there.

572
00:53:56,653 --> 00:53:58,155
Left her in the field to rot.

573
00:53:59,781 --> 00:54:01,325
Took her three days to die.

574
00:54:02,117 --> 00:54:06,205
Last thing she said was, "Why?"

575
00:54:10,167 --> 00:54:12,920
Hopped a train to St. Louis,
made my way down to Mississippi,

576
00:54:13,003 --> 00:54:15,047
found myself in this here swamp.

577
00:54:18,175 --> 00:54:19,218
And know what I saw?

578
00:54:22,179 --> 00:54:25,891
I saw niggers, just like her…

579
00:54:26,934 --> 00:54:32,189
running, hiding… surviving.

580
00:54:34,358 --> 00:54:37,903
People make 'em out to be ignorant,
but far from it.

581
00:54:40,322 --> 00:54:46,411
In fact, what's worse… [chuckles]
…is they tend to be persistent.

582
00:54:46,495 --> 00:54:48,163
[sidekick sighs]

583
00:54:48,956 --> 00:54:49,957
See, one gets free…

584
00:54:51,333 --> 00:54:57,506
then another, then another,
then another, then another.

585
00:54:58,131 --> 00:55:02,469
And someday,
they may return the favor on us.

586
00:55:05,722 --> 00:55:06,807
Can you imagine?

587
00:55:12,437 --> 00:55:13,438
Hmm.

Yes, sir.

You come around the barn,

- Sir?
- [chuckles] Captain Lyons sold you.

01:33:54,676 --> 01:33:55,677
You are with Lincoln?

905
01:33:56,261 --> 01:33:57,095
Yes, we are.

906
01:33:57,179 --> 01:33:58,597
- Give the man some water.
- Yes, sir.

907
01:34:01,183 --> 01:34:02,184
Water.

908
01:34:06,647 --> 01:34:07,773
[sipping]

909
01:34:09,107 --> 01:34:10,400
[coughs]

910
01:34:11,318 --> 01:34:12,277
You alone?

911
01:34:12,361 --> 01:34:14,488
[breathing heavily]

912
01:34:18,158 --> 01:34:20,911
Can you take me to my family?
[breathes shakily]

913
01:34:21,537 --> 01:34:22,579
- Help this man.
- Yes, sir.

914
01:34:22,663 --> 01:34:24,289
Get him shoes. Take his shoes!

915
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:28,961
Come on.

916
01:34:44,518 --> 01:34:46,645
[laughing echoing]

917
01:34:51,692 --> 01:34:53,110
[child] <i>What are they, Papa?</i>

918
01:34:54,611 --> 01:34:56,697
[Peter] <i>God's little angels.</i>

919
01:34:58,115 --> 01:34:59,533
[child] <i>Why are they here?</i>

920
01:35:00,742 --> 01:35:01,952
[Peter] <i>They guide our way.</i>

921
01:35:24,057 --> 01:35:26,602
[muffled shouting]

922
01:35:30,189 --> 01:35:32,024
[muffled shouting]

923
01:35:34,318 --> 01:35:36,320
[coughing]

924
01:35:55,756 --> 01:35:57,591
[coughing]

925
01:36:09,102 --> 01:36:12,272
[nurse] Didn't think you
would make it. Your leg was so infected.

926
01:36:13,565 --> 01:36:14,566
Where is this?

927
01:36:15,901 --> 01:36:17,027
Baton Rouge.

928
01:36:22,199 --> 01:36:25,661
I must get to my family. [grunts, pants]

929
01:36:25,744 --> 01:36:27,079
You must rest.

930
01:36:29,915 --> 01:36:32,960
[grunts, coughs]

931
01:37:08,954 --> 01:37:10,789
[inaudible chatter]

932
01:38:00,255 --> 01:38:01,298
[army officer] <i>Your name?</i>

933
01:38:02,591 --> 01:38:03,800
Peter.

934
01:38:03,884 --> 01:38:04,885
[army officer] Age?

935
01:38:05,928 --> 01:38:08,055
Um, I don't know.

936
01:38:08,847 --> 01:38:09,848
Well, pick something.

937
01:38:12,267 --> 01:38:13,393
You pick something.

938
01:38:17,940 --> 01:38:18,941
[sighs]

939
01:38:22,361 --> 01:38:23,362
Forty-eight.

940
01:38:25,531 --> 01:38:26,990
[army officer] Did you know your parents?

941
01:38:29,451 --> 01:38:30,410
Yes.

942
01:38:30,494 --> 01:38:31,495
Where were they from?

943
01:38:32,120 --> 01:38:33,288
Haiti.

944
01:38:33,872 --> 01:38:36,583
Haiti. Is that where you were born?

945
01:38:37,835 --> 01:38:38,836
Yes.

946
01:38:39,461 --> 01:38:40,504
Former owner?

947
01:38:42,005 --> 01:38:45,092
Lyons. Captain John Lyons.

948
01:38:46,051 --> 01:38:50,222
Cotton planter. The Atchafalaya River.

949
01:38:50,848 --> 01:38:52,850
Atchafalaya. Is that where you ran from?

950
01:38:54,935 --> 01:38:59,523
No. The Army men come, take me to Clinton.
I run from there.

951
01:39:00,148 --> 01:39:01,149
Clinton.

952
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:04,361
See.

953
01:39:09,074 --> 01:39:10,659
Did you see a railway in Clinton?

954
01:39:12,578 --> 01:39:14,788
Hmm? Train cars carrying big guns?

955
01:39:15,664 --> 01:39:18,417
Yes, I built the tracks.

956
01:39:20,544 --> 01:39:21,628
Am I not free?

957
01:39:21,712 --> 01:39:23,088
Just keep yourself steady.

958
01:39:25,632 --> 01:39:28,010
Technically, while you're here,
you're contraband.

959
01:39:28,886 --> 01:39:29,887
Stolen property.

960
01:39:31,305 --> 01:39:32,764
I must get to my family.

961
01:39:34,266 --> 01:39:38,061
- Dodienne, Betsy, Scipion…
- Mm-mmm. No, no, no.

962
01:39:38,145 --> 01:39:39,646
- …Laurette.
- No, no, no.

963
01:39:39,730 --> 01:39:41,773
- Write their names down.
- No, that is not how this is.

964
01:39:41,857 --> 01:39:44,610
You write down their names.
Lincoln say I am free.

965
01:39:44,693 --> 01:39:46,737
Oh, he did? Well, that's a good thing.

966
01:39:48,655 --> 01:39:50,908
Next time you see Lincoln,
please give him my compliments.

967
01:39:52,117 --> 01:39:55,662
Right now you're in an army camp,
during a time of war.

968
01:39:57,080 --> 01:39:58,415
Understand?

969
01:39:58,498 --> 01:40:00,709
So you and everyone else who ran here
has a choice.

970
01:40:02,002 --> 01:40:03,545
You'll work on one of the Federal farms…

971
01:40:03,629 --> 01:40:05,005
- governed by this here…
- I will not.

972
01:40:05,088 --> 01:40:07,049
- …set of rules and regulations…
- I will not.

973
01:40:08,133 --> 01:40:10,594
Or you will join the army.

974
01:40:12,846 --> 01:40:16,683
You help us beat these godforsaken devils,
my good man,

975
01:40:16,767 --> 01:40:18,769
and you will not just
get back with your family.

976
01:40:20,562 --> 01:40:21,980
You will help free your family.

977
01:40:25,567 --> 01:40:28,445
And I'm sure your good friend Lincoln
will be mighty proud of you…

978
01:40:30,739 --> 01:40:32,032
Mr. Peter.

979
01:40:33,325 --> 01:40:35,077
Show this man to the Native Guard.

980
01:40:36,119 --> 01:40:37,120
You're dismissed, soldier.

981
01:40:39,665 --> 01:40:40,499
Next.

982
01:40:49,341 --> 01:40:51,718
Gordon. Gordon! Gordon... Please, please.

983
01:40:51,802 --> 01:40:54,137
- Gordon. Gordon, my friend.
- [groaning]

984
01:40:54,221 --> 01:40:55,264
Good to see you, my friend.

985
01:40:55,347 --> 01:40:58,600
- Good to see you. How are you?
- [exhales sharply] We made it.

986
01:40:58,684 --> 01:41:00,853
Yes, we have.

987
01:41:00,936 --> 01:41:01,812
John?

988
01:41:01,895 --> 01:41:04,231
[sighs] No, he did not make it.

989
01:41:04,314 --> 01:41:05,816
- [groans]
- I will come see you.

990
01:41:05,899 --> 01:41:07,526
- [groans]
- Thank you.

991
01:41:14,116 --> 01:41:16,493
[Native Guard soldier] Squad, attention!

992
01:41:20,706 --> 01:41:22,291
Squad, at rest.

993
01:41:23,917 --> 01:41:28,589
New recruits, eyes forward.
One arm-length from the next man.

994
01:41:29,464 --> 01:41:30,465
Move up.

995
01:41:32,009 --> 01:41:33,010
Welcome, Brother.

996
01:41:33,635 --> 01:41:34,970
You pick up your uniform up there.

997
01:41:43,103 --> 01:41:44,021
<i>Bonsoir</i>, Peter.

998
01:41:44,104 --> 01:41:46,982
<i>Bonsoir</i>. They're going to let us fight.

999
01:41:47,524 --> 01:41:48,734
They may not have a choice.

1000
01:41:49,860 --> 01:41:50,861
Be ready.

1001
01:41:51,445 --> 01:41:52,696
[nurse] There he is, there.

1002
01:41:54,698 --> 01:41:57,576
My leg is fine. You will not take it.

1003
01:41:58,285 --> 01:42:01,538
Your... Oh, no, no. We're not doctors, sir.

1004
01:42:01,622 --> 01:42:04,458
No… [stammers] …uh...
We were alerted to your condition.

1005
01:42:05,709 --> 01:42:09,171
Uh... Well, with your permission,
we were wondering

1006
01:42:09,254 --> 01:42:11,465
if you wouldn't like to join us
for a few moments.

1007
01:42:12,716 --> 01:42:14,718
It's okay. They're good people.

1008
01:42:16,261 --> 01:42:19,014
A uniform will be waiting
when you get back. Yeah? Go on.

1009
01:42:22,142 --> 01:42:23,894
- Right this way, sir.
- Thank you, Sister.

1010
01:42:33,445 --> 01:42:34,446
All right.

1011
01:42:35,155 --> 01:42:36,156
It's called a camera.

1012
01:42:38,242 --> 01:42:39,201
What does it do?

1013
01:42:39,284 --> 01:42:40,285
Well…

1014
01:42:43,080 --> 01:42:44,081
See, it, uh...

1015
01:42:45,874 --> 01:42:47,000
Makes a likeness of you.

1016
01:42:49,002 --> 01:42:51,797
Peter, we're gonna make sure
that every person in the world

1017
01:42:52,464 --> 01:42:54,466
knows exactly
what slavery truly looks like.

1018
01:42:57,469 --> 01:42:58,470
All right?

1019
01:43:02,140 --> 01:43:05,978
Now, um, if you could just
turn your back toward...

1020
01:43:06,061 --> 01:43:07,062
Do not touch me.

1021
01:43:10,691 --> 01:43:11,692
I'm sorry.

1022
01:43:13,068 --> 01:43:18,073
If... If you could turn your back
towards the camera, please.

1023
01:43:24,204 --> 01:43:25,205
And, um,

1024
01:43:26,039 --> 01:43:28,000
maybe put your arm out...

1025
01:43:28,083 --> 01:43:30,544
Your hand on your hip, like so.

1026
01:43:34,965 --> 01:43:36,216
And, uh, t-turn your head.

1027
01:43:36,842 --> 01:43:37,843
A little more. Yeah.

1028
01:43:39,428 --> 01:43:40,429
Is that comfortable?

1029
01:43:41,805 --> 01:43:42,806
Mmm.

1030
01:43:44,016 --> 01:43:45,017
[clears throat]

1031
01:43:50,272 --> 01:43:52,608
[watch ticking]

1032
01:44:09,791 --> 01:44:12,294
[clears throat] Thank you.

1033
01:44:12,377 --> 01:44:14,338
You were born a free man?

1034
01:44:14,421 --> 01:44:16,548
Yeah, that's right.
Bunch of us in this company.

1035
01:44:17,466 --> 01:44:19,259
Allowed to read and to write?

1036
01:44:19,927 --> 01:44:21,303
Allowed to do a lot of things.

1037
01:44:22,721 --> 01:44:26,600
If someone must allow you to do something,
then you are not really free, are you?

1038
01:44:26,683 --> 01:44:28,727
[sighs] No.

1039
01:44:31,647 --> 01:44:32,648
Sir?

1040
01:44:35,776 --> 01:44:36,777
[sighs]

1041
01:44:37,361 --> 01:44:41,365
Captain Cailloux
and Private Peter reporting, sir.

1042
01:44:43,283 --> 01:44:47,120
We know Johnny Reb has big guns
all along the ridge here.

1043
01:44:47,955 --> 01:44:50,916
It seems they're putting new ones
down here, along the river,

1044
01:44:50,999 --> 01:44:52,626
just south of Port Hudson.

1045
01:44:53,710 --> 01:44:56,505
Now if we don't open up this bend here
along the Mississippi,

1046
01:44:57,172 --> 01:44:58,841
we'll never control the South.

1047
01:44:58,924 --> 01:44:59,925
Hmm.

1048
01:45:02,845 --> 01:45:05,264
Is this the Negro here
that was running from Clinton?

1049
01:45:05,347 --> 01:45:06,348
Yes, sir.

1050
01:45:08,058 --> 01:45:09,601
What were you doing there?

1051
01:45:09,685 --> 01:45:11,353
We built the railroad.

1052
01:45:12,604 --> 01:45:13,939
[general] What did you see?

1053
01:45:14,982 --> 01:45:15,983
It's okay.

1054
01:45:16,066 --> 01:45:17,109
Cannons.

1055
01:45:17,693 --> 01:45:18,694
Cannons?

1056
01:45:19,361 --> 01:45:20,195
Like them?

1057
01:45:22,865 --> 01:45:24,157
No, not like those.

1058
01:45:25,367 --> 01:45:26,451
Big cannons.

1059
01:45:28,203 --> 01:45:29,538
Did you see troops?

1060
01:45:30,247 --> 01:45:31,582
Many soldiers.

1061
01:45:34,209 --> 01:45:38,672
We've got to take Port Hudson
before those reinforcements arrive.

1062
01:45:40,132 --> 01:45:41,675
General, permission to speak?

1063
01:45:42,467 --> 01:45:43,802
[sighs]

1064
01:45:43,886 --> 01:45:45,596
Johnny Reb is dug in there real deep.

1065
01:45:46,388 --> 01:45:47,639
There's only one way in.

1066
01:45:49,308 --> 01:45:50,809
It's a killing field, sir.

1067
01:45:50,893 --> 01:45:52,519
I know what it is.

1068
01:45:54,938 --> 01:45:56,815
But somebody has to mount that attack.

1069
01:46:06,783 --> 01:46:10,245
How the hell did you survive
all those days in the swamp? Hmm?

1070
01:46:10,329 --> 01:46:11,663
I know the swamp.

1071
01:46:12,539 --> 01:46:13,665
Yes, well…

1072
01:46:15,667 --> 01:46:17,252
doesn't mean you're fit for combat.

1073
01:46:19,671 --> 01:46:23,759
In closed circles,
there's the great Negro question…

1074
01:46:25,969 --> 01:46:29,056
Are you fighters, or are you runners?

1075
01:46:32,726 --> 01:46:33,852
You know what I see here?

1076
01:46:36,146 --> 01:46:37,147
Disobedience.

1077
01:46:40,651 --> 01:46:41,652
Dismissed.

1078
01:46:47,032 --> 01:46:48,033
Come on, now.

1079
01:46:50,077 --> 01:46:52,788
Come on, boy. This ain't the time.
Come on, let's go.

1080
01:46:53,956 --> 01:46:55,541
I fight them.

1081
01:46:59,127 --> 01:47:00,003
