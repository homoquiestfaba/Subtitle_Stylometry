1
00:00:46,314 --> 00:00:48,749
<i>...authorities say they've been
looking for the little girl</i>

2
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:49,975
<i>for the past two months.</i>

3
00:00:50,084 --> 00:00:51,882
<i>Hopefully, they can find her soon.</i>

4
00:00:51,986 --> 00:00:55,320
<i>Meanwhile, you're listening
to KWDD, the Dust Devil,</i>

5
00:00:55,423 --> 00:00:57,482
<i>here in the Valley of Lordsburg.</i>

6
00:00:57,591 --> 00:00:59,753
<i>I'm good ol' Jack Tumbleweed.</i>

7
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,056
<i>Here's one that I've been keyed in</i>

8
00:01:02,163 --> 00:01:05,758
<i>on KWDD, the Dust Devil.</i>

9
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:07,925
Hey, what about me?

10
00:01:12,974 --> 00:01:14,203
So how do you know it's even a girl?

11
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:16,399
I know so.

12
00:01:19,347 --> 00:01:21,338
Damn, someone's in a hurry!

13
00:01:21,449 --> 00:01:23,008
Her brother was in my unit.

14
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,482
- PFC Reynolds.
-Oh, really?

15
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:29,487
And how does Private First Class Reynolds
feel about you and his sister?

16
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:33,086
I doubt he really cares.

17
00:01:33,194 --> 00:01:35,094
- And why is that?
-'Cause he's dead.

18
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:42,165
They'd write each other letters.

19
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:45,637
He sent a picture of the both of us,
so she asked him about me.

20
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,230
The only person I had to write

21
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:49,776
while I was over there was like my pops.

22
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:52,505
She and I have
kept in touch over the years.

23
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,274
What's her name?

24
00:01:54,382 --> 00:01:55,543
Sarah.

25
00:01:57,318 --> 00:01:58,581
You got a picture?

26
00:02:05,426 --> 00:02:07,053
Whoa! She's a babe!

27
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:09,596
She is very pretty.

28
00:02:09,697 --> 00:02:10,721
Ooh, I want to see.

29
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:13,425
Uh, you need to pay attention
to the road, mister.

30
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:14,660
Oh, come on.

31
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:21,136
Well, maybe you should invite her.

32
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:22,232
To what?

33
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:26,872
You didn't tell him?

34
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,018
Babe, I didn't tell anyone.

35
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:32,108
Really?

36
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:33,948
What's the big deal?

37
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,183
We are getting married.

38
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:40,658
What the fuck?

39
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:42,058
Congratulations.

40
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:43,221
Dude, are you serious?

41
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,526
yeah, man. Next Spring.

42
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:50,160
Oh, look, babe, a rest stop.
I need to pee.

43
00:02:50,271 --> 00:02:52,239
I second that notion.

44
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:47,253
Ugh, that's disgusting.

45
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:07,747
Thanks, man.

46
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:09,577
For what?

47
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:12,084
For this. You know,
you guys coming with me

48
00:04:12,186 --> 00:04:15,087
and driving me and all. Thanks.

49
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:17,453
Don't mention it

50
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:24,323
It's just like old times.

51
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,929
Dude, I can't believe
you're getting married.

52
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:31,829
Yeah, me too.

53
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,307
I was like...
kind of thought you'd be the last.

54
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:42,272
Well, it looks like old Jude here
is gonna be the last.

55
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:46,752
Yeah, yeah. Well, boys, I gotta go
talk to a man about a horse.

56
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:50,620
Hey, the ladies' is on the right side.

57
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:07,204
Be outside, babe.

58
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,378
<i>Hey! -</i>

59
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:15,807
Hey, baby cakes.

60
00:05:17,418 --> 00:05:18,510
Wanna go for a ride?

61
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:21,145
You want me to show
you boys how to ride that thing?

62
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:23,947
Any time, doll.

63
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:48,637
Hey, you guys ready to go?

64
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,574
Hey, Alice, where's Jill?

65
00:06:50,678 --> 00:06:52,043
Same place she's been.

66
00:06:52,146 --> 00:06:54,274
In the shitter, dude.

67
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:55,974
Alice, can you go check on her?

68
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,050
Yeah.

69
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:04,754
Hey, I've been waiting for the girls
to be gone. Check this out.

70
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:19,231
Hey, are you done yet?

71
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,178
Seriously, we're gonna leave you.

72
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:31,307
This is the only thing
my old man gave me before he died.

73
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:35,045
Jill?

74
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:40,184
Jill?

75
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:49,833
Nolan! She's not in there!

76
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:55,539
What do you mean she's not in there?

77
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,167
She's just not in there.

78
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:05,842
Jill!

79
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,625
Did you see her come out?

80
00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:22,702
No.

81
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,196
Neithed did I.

82
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:27,899
She couldn't have gone too far.

83
00:08:33,447 --> 00:08:34,471
Jill!

84
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:37,116
Jill!

85
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:42,487
Jill!

86
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:45,183
Jill!
Jill!

87
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:46,384
Really?

88
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:49,895
Jill!

89
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:53,531
Jill!

90
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,730
Where is she?

91
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:02,536
Are you sure she didn't leave before you?

92
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:04,543
No, she was in there when I walked out.

93
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:06,044
Okay, calm down.
Let's just think about it.

94
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:07,113
No!

95
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:09,706
Where could she have gone?

96
00:09:09,817 --> 00:09:12,752
Come on, guys.
We're talking about Jill here.

97
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:15,083
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

98
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,758
I'm just saying, man.

99
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:18,791
Dillon, shut up.

100
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:22,294
Maybe she got scared.
You know, there were those bikers.

101
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,125
- The fucking bikers.
-What?

102
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,427
- The fucking bikers.
-What about 'em?

103
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:28,968
Come on,
we gotta catch up with them.

104
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,036
Come on!

105
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:55,927
- Maybe we should just--
-Shut the fuck up, Jude!

106
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,794
You don't wanna help,
you can get out now.

107
00:10:01,902 --> 00:10:03,927
But how do you know
that she's with them?

108
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:16,381
Nolan, dude.

109
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:18,178
Man, shut the fuck up.

110
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:20,379
what of jude's right?

111
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:31,956
Did you see the way
those guys looked at Alice?

112
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:34,659
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
that they took Jill.

113
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:41,199
you got any other ideas?

114
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,675
I thought the war
would have made you a man,

115
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:45,108
but you're being a little fuck...

116
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:47,146
Hold your fucking mouth right there!

117
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:54,819
This is stupid.

118
00:10:54,922 --> 00:10:56,720
Shut up,Alice.

119
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:59,918
There was no one else there,
and that one fucking guy!

120
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:13,065
Nolan. Dude!

121
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,345
What? You pussin' out, too?

122
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:25,749
If you want, I can drop all your
asses off and take care of this myself.

123
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,589
I didn't say I was pussin' out.

124
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:37,687
I'm just sayin', how do you know
that they even got her?

125
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:40,495
Because there was nobody else there.

126
00:11:40,601 --> 00:11:44,299
Because...
Fucking because...

127
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:46,395
She's all I've got, man.

128
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:50,105
There they are.

129
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:18,896
Did you see anything?

130
00:12:19,006 --> 00:12:21,236
You drove passed them
like a hundred miles an hour.

131
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:22,740
How the hell are we supposed to know?

132
00:12:28,382 --> 00:12:30,248
Shit! She's gotta be in the van.

133
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:43,052
Alice, stay here.
Dillon, come on, open the trunk.

134
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:44,255
what?
look, man

135
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:47,459
in about three seconds those bikers are
gonna be upon us. Now, open the trunk.

136
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:48,762
So, now...

137
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:51,664
Fuck it, Nolan. Just do it.

138
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:04,114
Babe, just stay in the car.

139
00:14:09,483 --> 00:14:11,577
You boys wanna tell me
what the fuck you're doing?

140
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:15,019
I'm looking for my girlfriend

141
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:21,554
Look, man...

142
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:24,028
No, you look!

143
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:27,032
Where is she, motherfucker?

144
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:29,933
Nobody puts a gun in my face.

145
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,528
Yeah, well, I just did, asshole!

146
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:37,941
Think you're a man because you got a gun?

147
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,405
Tell him to get out.

148
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:51,518
I'm not gonna ask you again.
Don't move!

149
00:14:52,793 --> 00:14:56,423
Tell that asshole
to get the fuck out of the van!

150
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:05,404
Now, look,

151
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:09,305
you boys have no idea what
you've gotten yourselves into here.

152
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:13,375
Now, I'm gonna give you a chance

153
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,212
to get your tight little assess
in your pretty little car

154
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:21,151
and drive the fuck away,
and we forget about this.

155
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:24,781
I'm the one making
the rules here, not you!

156
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,519
My girlfriend was at the rest stop
and now she's gone,

157
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,258
and you fucks were the only ones there.

158
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:35,494
Sit the fuck down!

159
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,898
Answer my fucking question!

160
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:52,474
Well, I tried...
tried to be decent,

161
00:15:52,586 --> 00:15:56,853
but now, you done fucked up.

162
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:04,357
Now...

163
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:10,935
What we got here is a Mexican standoff.

164
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:12,596
You know what that is, boy?

165
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:20,046
That's where I shoot you,

166
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,272
and he shoots him.

167
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:23,679
And i blow off tour fucking head.

168
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:28,648
Hey, fat-ass,

169
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:31,816
unless you wanna
see the insides of this man,

170
00:16:31,925 --> 00:16:33,950
I suggest you drop it.

171
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:37,056
Now, any of you others carrying,

172
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,655
or just Mama Bear and Tinker Bell here?

173
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:46,337
Oh, okay.
Real hard-asses, huh?

174
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:51,334
Line up over there!

175
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:54,543
Did I fucking stutter?

176
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:12,925
Now, my friend here asked you
a simple fucking question

177
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:16,230
that deserves a simple fucking answer.

178
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:18,600
Did you see the girl?

179
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:25,711
Fuck you.

180
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:29,544
I will not hesitate to kill
every last one of you!

181
00:17:30,984 --> 00:17:32,543
Give me your fucking keys!

182
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:40,287
All right.
Now, this is how it's gonna go.

183
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,987
You boys are gonna walk to those hills

184
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:45,258
until you don't see us anymore.

185
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:46,924
Easy enough?

186
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:49,229
This is not the end of the road.

187
00:17:49,336 --> 00:17:52,306
It's just a detour.
It's not the end of this.

188
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:56,535
Yeah, it is.
Now turn around, beat your feet.

189
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:11,351
You're dead.

190
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:21,098
Where the fuck did that come from?

191
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:26,166
Yeah, I don't even know what to say.

192
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:50,058
What happened?

193
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:51,927
They didn't have her.

194
00:18:52,032 --> 00:18:53,898
What do you mean they didn't have her?
How do you know?

195
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,695
Well, I checked the van
and she wasn't there.

196
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:58,032
I'm going back to the rest stop.

197
00:18:58,138 --> 00:18:59,697
just drive.

198
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:00,830
No, I'm going back.

199
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,602
Nolan, she isn't back there.

200
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,474
I still think we should
go back to the rest stop.

201
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:08,047
Nolan, just drive!

202
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:10,048
But what if she's back there?

203
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,879
Yeah. I mean, we can't just leave her.

204
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,282
She isn't back there.

205
00:19:14,888 --> 00:19:16,686
How can you be so sure?

206
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:20,521
Well, I'm not, but going back there
just doesn't make sense.

207
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:22,652
She could've just gotten scared.

208
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:26,956
Look, man, the best thing we can do now

209
00:19:27,067 --> 00:19:29,161
is find the law around here.

210
00:19:31,071 --> 00:19:32,971
I think we can handle this.

211
00:19:33,073 --> 00:19:34,632
Didn't you see their colors?

212
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:36,971
- Whose colors?
-The bikers.

213
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:42,445
- Colors? What do you mean colors?
-You cut their fuel lines.

214
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:46,076
That isn't gonna stop them.
It's just gonna slow 'em down.

215
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:49,212
They're not gonna forget
what just happened.

216
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:52,348
Hey, what do you mean colors?

217
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:54,120
It means they belong to something.

218
00:19:54,227 --> 00:19:56,753
And they were on a schedule.

219
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:59,230
- What do you mean schedule?
-Oh, shit!

220
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:00,731
It doesn't matter.

221
00:20:00,834 --> 00:20:04,134
We just need to find the law around here.

222
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:06,228
Where the fuck could she be?

223
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:14,203
Okay, Alice, where was she whenever
you left the bathroom?

224
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:16,043
She was in the stall.

225
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:18,277
Okay. Was there anyone else
in there with you?

226
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:23,320
Not that I know of.
I didn't see anyone.

227
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,255
Dillon, was there any other cars there?

228
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:28,419
No.

229
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,720
You were in the bathroom when Jill was.

230
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:33,492
Did you hear anything?

231
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,898
Just some strange noises.

232
00:20:36,002 --> 00:20:37,731
What do you mean noises?

233
00:20:38,872 --> 00:20:40,567
Um.

234
00:20:41,975 --> 00:20:44,535
It was like a dog whimpering
or something.

235
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:48,105
The real weird thing, though,

236
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:50,012
was all these fliers of missing people.

237
00:20:51,184 --> 00:20:53,482
- There were stacks of them.
-Oh, God.

238
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:01,925
Wait, I did!
I saw a purple Cadillac pull up,

239
00:21:02,028 --> 00:21:04,292
right before we left

240
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:07,094
Like the one from the highway?

241
00:21:09,536 --> 00:21:11,664
I think so.

242
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,637
What are you talking about?

243
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,402
The car that passed us on the highway.

244
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:17,738
<i>I was at the stop?</i>

245
00:21:17,844 --> 00:21:19,471
I think.

246
00:21:22,582 --> 00:21:25,142
Come on. We'll find her.

247
00:21:31,057 --> 00:21:34,186
Jill, come on, baby.
Where are you?

248
00:21:44,571 --> 00:21:47,632
Oh, you son of a bitch!

249
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,300
Those fuckers cut our fuel lines.

250
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:54,509
They cut this tire, too.

251
00:22:09,596 --> 00:22:12,531
Man, you got lucky.

252
00:22:12,632 --> 00:22:15,932
Mickey doesn't usually
let prospects off so easily.

253
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:19,164
Nah, Mickey is just smart.

254
00:22:19,272 --> 00:22:22,003
He'll be whooping my ass
after I get his bike up and running.

255
00:22:22,108 --> 00:22:24,167
Rev, you find those keys yet?

256
00:22:24,277 --> 00:22:25,904
Sure thing.

257
00:22:28,081 --> 00:22:33,542
Hold on to 'em. It's gonna be
a long time before you're riding again.

258
00:22:33,653 --> 00:22:35,678
<i>Though, hey. hey.</i>

259
00:22:35,788 --> 00:22:42,091
If you can get these bikes
and the wagon up and running again...

260
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:45,028
Fifteen.
Can you do it?

261
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:52,004
I can get the wagon,
two of them bikes up and running.

262
00:22:52,105 --> 00:22:53,800
I don't know about that third.

263
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,643
Get mine and Derek's going.

264
00:23:00,747 --> 00:23:02,806
We'll pick up Victor's on the way back.

265
00:23:02,949 --> 00:23:07,011
- What about my bike?
-Did I ask?

266
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,557
No. Help him.
Fix the tire.

267
00:23:14,527 --> 00:23:16,359
All  right.

268
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:01,268
Damn it.

269
00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:07,469
I haven't seen a soul for miles,
and we really need gas.

270
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,880
We were sitting on a quarter of a tank.
How did you expect...

271
00:24:11,017 --> 00:24:17,115
Hey, I didn't expect to be traveling
the back woods of this fucking state!

272
00:24:17,223 --> 00:24:19,123
Oh, yeah. It was a shortcut.

273
00:24:19,225 --> 00:24:23,856
No. It was Jill's idea.

274
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:26,057
What did you say, pussy?

275
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:29,533
no, stop!Fucking stop!

276
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:32,730
- Fuck you, Nolan!
-Dillon, shut up.

277
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:35,934
-What?
-I said stop the car.

278
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:22,180
Well, we're almost out of gas.

279
00:25:22,288 --> 00:25:24,313
It may be our only chance.

280
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:33,595
Goddamn fuckin'...

281
00:25:46,646 --> 00:25:49,616
Come on.
Come on now.

282
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,877
Ain't that hard.

283
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:54,351
See, you pulling it off.

284
00:25:54,454 --> 00:25:59,016
What are you yelling about
your clothes for, huh? There we go.

285
00:26:03,863 --> 00:26:06,958
We should've buried those kids.

286
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:09,228
Whe shold've buried'em

287
00:26:09,335 --> 00:26:14,034
But instead, my bike is gonna
be sitting out here in the desert...

288
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:17,940
rusting in some bush.

289
00:26:22,548 --> 00:26:23,982
You Know...

290
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:31,280
If it were up to me,
we'd be moving dirt right now.

291
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:36,557
What would you have done about the car?

292
00:26:43,236 --> 00:26:47,139
Hmm? Don't be shy.

293
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,174
What would you do about the car?

294
00:26:55,448 --> 00:26:59,146
I would've parked it in the desert.

295
00:26:59,252 --> 00:27:04,315
How about that.
What next? Come on. Go on.

296
00:27:11,397 --> 00:27:15,095
Well, we...
We would've just rode off.

297
00:27:20,406 --> 00:27:23,740
<i>Check the wagon for the dope'?</i>

298
00:27:23,843 --> 00:27:25,402
You didn't, did you?

299
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:31,912
Stupid piece of shit!

300
00:27:36,422 --> 00:27:41,155
I like this road!
Nobody gives us any problems!

301
00:27:43,796 --> 00:27:48,597
Now, is pride more important
than making our delivery?

302
00:27:48,701 --> 00:27:50,692
No

303
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:58,500
Now, if you'd kept
your fuckin' mouth shut, you'd know,

304
00:27:58,611 --> 00:28:02,343
you and Rev are gonna go
make the delivery.

305
00:28:02,448 --> 00:28:06,180
Derek and I are gonna go
take care of the pride.

306
00:28:06,285 --> 00:28:08,845
Does that work for you?

307
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,206
Yeah.

308
00:28:32,445 --> 00:28:36,211
Good. I aims to please.

309
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,616
Rev, you got the bikes ready?

310
00:28:43,723 --> 00:28:44,656
Yes, sir.

311
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:48,192
Good! Derek, let's go.

312
00:30:03,936 --> 00:30:04,960
Hello?

313
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:16,640
Hey! Anybody?

314
00:30:18,918 --> 00:30:20,818
Let's go look around.

315
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:07,424
It doesn't look like anyone's
been here in quite some time.

316
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:08,466
Yeah.

317
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:31,982
What the hell is that?

318
00:31:47,773 --> 00:31:49,104
What are you doing?

319
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:52,200
- What the fuck, man?
-What the hell are you doing?

320
00:31:52,311 --> 00:31:54,643
- Trying to get to the phone.
-Not like that.

321
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:56,681
What is your problem?

322
00:31:56,782 --> 00:31:59,774
The last time I listened to you,
I had to put a gun in a man's face,

323
00:31:59,885 --> 00:32:02,252
and I'm not gonna do that again.

324
00:32:02,354 --> 00:32:05,346
Fuck, I should've gone back
to the rest stop!

325
00:32:05,457 --> 00:32:07,926
Are you crazy?
She isn't back there, you idiot!

326
00:32:12,865 --> 00:32:14,026
Stop it!

327
00:32:14,133 --> 00:32:15,464
Jude, come on!

328
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:30,638
The last thing we need right now
is these people to find us in their place.

329
00:32:30,749 --> 00:32:32,410
We don't need another mess.

330
00:32:42,194 --> 00:32:43,457
Fuck you!

331
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,164
Fuck all of you!

332
00:32:47,733 --> 00:32:50,134
We should've gone back!

333
00:32:50,236 --> 00:32:54,696
Jill's out there, alone, and I'm
the only one who seems to give a shit!

334
00:32:58,043 --> 00:32:59,636
Dillon, just let him cool off.

335
00:33:23,903 --> 00:33:25,268
Let me see your eye.

336
00:33:25,371 --> 00:33:27,271
It's fine.

337
00:33:27,373 --> 00:33:29,068
Maybe we should've gone back.

338
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:30,835
For what?

339
00:33:42,821 --> 00:33:44,084
Hello?

340
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:20,317
Ugh! What the hell is that?

341
00:34:40,112 --> 00:34:41,671
What was that?

342
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,248
What?

343
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:45,147
I don't know,
but I'm pretty sure I saw something.

344
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,446
- Where?
-Just over there.

345
00:34:53,058 --> 00:34:55,584
It must have been a dog or something.
We probably just spooked it.

346
00:34:55,694 --> 00:35:00,029
What I saw was larger than a dog, Jude.

347
00:35:00,132 --> 00:35:01,531
Maybe it was a grizzly

348
00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:04,625
Yeah, because grizzlies
roam the buildings in the desert

349
00:35:04,737 --> 00:35:06,796
Hey, you never know.

350
00:35:20,919 --> 00:35:24,378
help me , please!

351
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:26,686
Somebody help!

352
00:35:29,561 --> 00:35:31,461
Somebody help!

353
00:35:38,003 --> 00:35:39,562
We need to get the fuck out of here.

354
00:35:39,671 --> 00:35:40,900
I was hoping you would say that.

355
00:35:41,006 --> 00:35:43,475
There's something about
this place just ain't right.

356
00:35:48,847 --> 00:35:53,080
I didn't say anything earlier,
but when we pulled in,

357
00:35:53,185 --> 00:35:56,553
I could've sworn there was
someone right over there.

358
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:59,317
Why didn't you say anything then?

359
00:35:59,425 --> 00:36:00,551
I thought I was seeing things.

360
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:03,492
It doesn't matter. We just need
to find Nolan and get out of here.

361
00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:05,029
Where is Nolan?

362
00:36:19,645 --> 00:36:21,170
Is somebody there?

363
00:36:29,755 --> 00:36:30,881
Fuck this.

364
00:36:36,662 --> 00:36:40,929
We're halfway there,
and we get our asses kicked again.

365
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:43,468
Again?
because..yeah, again.again.

366
00:36:43,569 --> 00:36:45,731
I haven't gotten my ass kicked.

367
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:48,830
- At least not today.
-Shut up, Rev. Shut your...

368
00:36:52,478 --> 00:36:55,607
Just wait till I come up.
You know it and I know it, okay?

369
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:58,809
- Yeah.
-lt's gonna happen. It's gonna...

370
00:37:03,789 --> 00:37:05,985
Hold it. slow down.

371
00:37:09,695 --> 00:37:10,753
What's that sign say?

372
00:37:10,863 --> 00:37:11,989
It looks like gas up there.

373
00:37:17,436 --> 00:37:21,202
Let's make that-- Make a right.
Make a right, right here. Okay.

374
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:43,721
Oh, shit!

375
00:38:04,049 --> 00:38:06,313
Oh, shit. The bikers.

376
00:38:09,188 --> 00:38:10,622
Dillon!

377
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:13,123
- Did you find Nolan?
-No, we've got another problem.

378
00:38:15,527 --> 00:38:17,291
- Shit, where are we going?
-Hide!

379
00:39:18,023 --> 00:39:19,923
Now they're not going anywhere.

380
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:25,195
Sure we should've stopped here, though?

381
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:34,530
We're not.

382
00:39:36,675 --> 00:39:39,110
Don't worry.

383
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:40,906
The shipment will make it.

384
00:39:41,013 --> 00:39:43,414
It'll make it. It'll make it.

385
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:53,986
Besides... we take care
of this business here,

386
00:39:55,994 --> 00:39:59,760
and you'll be getting
your colors soon, son. All right?

387
00:39:59,865 --> 00:40:01,731
I just don't want Mickey on my ass.

388
00:40:01,833 --> 00:40:04,632
Don't you worry about Mickey, all right?

389
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:08,138
What you gotta worry about
is me, putting my foot...

390
00:40:10,042 --> 00:40:13,444
Rev, what the fuck am I looking at?

391
00:40:13,545 --> 00:40:15,741
Hey! Hey, boy.

392
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,709
Come on.

393
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:28,423
The hell's he wearing on his head?

394
00:40:30,896 --> 00:40:33,558
I don't know. It's kid shit.

395
00:40:42,274 --> 00:40:44,333
Didn't your mama teach you to share?

396
00:40:50,215 --> 00:40:52,741
Mean little son of a bitch, ain't you?

397
00:40:57,189 --> 00:40:59,248
Hey, where are your folks, kid?

398
00:41:04,062 --> 00:41:07,293
Oh, does that mean you ain't got none?

399
00:41:17,008 --> 00:41:19,170
Come on. Come on!

400
00:41:47,439 --> 00:41:50,033
- What the fuck was that?
-It doesn't matter.

401
00:41:50,142 --> 00:41:52,509
- What about Nolan?
-If he saw that, he's already gone.

402
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,741
Stay down.

403
00:42:38,256 --> 00:42:39,451
Who are you?

404
00:42:42,027 --> 00:42:43,756
Why are my hands tied?

405
00:42:45,864 --> 00:42:47,889
Did you hear me?

406
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:50,434
Why are my fucking hands tied?

407
00:42:53,705 --> 00:42:55,264
Answer me!

408
00:43:03,682 --> 00:43:05,946
You're just gonna leave me here?

409
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,579
Come on!

410
00:43:21,867 --> 00:43:24,336
Jill? Jill!

411
00:43:26,404 --> 00:43:28,668
You leave her alone, you fucker!

412
00:43:33,345 --> 00:43:35,814
Don't touch her, motherfucker!

413
00:43:40,418 --> 00:43:44,013
Look, man, just...
Just listen, please.

414
00:43:53,565 --> 00:43:55,158
Fuck!

415
00:43:59,037 --> 00:44:03,338
Jill, come on, baby.
Please, wake up.

416
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:07,708
Wake up, Jill. Wake up!

417
00:44:53,592 --> 00:44:57,153
Jill? What did you do to her?

418
00:45:09,107 --> 00:45:10,632
What are you doing?

419
00:46:51,209 --> 00:46:53,678
Oh, wait.

420
00:46:53,778 --> 00:46:56,975
What? No. Don't...

421
00:46:57,082 --> 00:46:59,847
No! No!

422
00:47:06,424 --> 00:47:10,657
No! You're dead!
Do you hear me?

423
00:47:10,762 --> 00:47:12,696
You're fucking dead!

424
00:47:12,797 --> 00:47:14,993
I'm gonna cut your fucking heads off!

425
00:47:16,901 --> 00:47:18,835
You son of a bitch!

426
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:08,979
I'll kill you, you piece of shit!

427
00:48:17,362 --> 00:48:19,626
- You two heard that, right?
-Sounded like Nolan.

428
00:48:19,731 --> 00:48:21,096
That was Nolan.

429
00:48:24,202 --> 00:48:26,193
What are you doing?

430
00:48:26,304 --> 00:48:27,430
I can't go.

431
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:32,904
Listen, I want you two
to head east on the highway.

432
00:48:33,011 --> 00:48:34,501
stop anyone that comes. Anyone.

433
00:48:34,612 --> 00:48:35,943
What are you gonna do?

434
00:48:36,047 --> 00:48:37,537
I'm gonna go get Nolan,

435
00:48:37,649 --> 00:48:39,048
then I'm gonna find you two.

436
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:41,585
Here, take this.

437
00:48:41,686 --> 00:48:43,780
And no matter what you hear,
you keep going, okay?

438
00:48:45,356 --> 00:48:46,323
Go!

439
00:48:52,897 --> 00:48:53,830
Fuck!

440
00:49:28,433 --> 00:49:29,366
Wait!

441
00:49:31,369 --> 00:49:34,634
Come on.
Remember, don't stop.

442
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:36,764
But what if they got him?

443
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:42,245
Just come on.
Let's keep going.

444
00:49:44,082 --> 00:49:45,550
Come on, baby.

445
00:51:29,887 --> 00:51:31,446
Why is this happening?

446
00:51:34,025 --> 00:51:35,652
Where is everyone'?

447
00:51:39,197 --> 00:51:40,665
I don't know, baby.

448
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:51,971
Hey, look at me.

449
00:51:57,582 --> 00:51:58,981
It's going to be okay.

450
00:52:04,589 --> 00:52:07,183
- Okay?
-Promise?

451
00:52:09,761 --> 00:52:11,525
Have I ever lied to you?

452
00:52:13,698 --> 00:52:16,133
We'll get out of here, and...

453
00:52:16,234 --> 00:52:19,169
we'll be listening to wedding bells,

454
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:20,965
before you can say when.

455
00:52:21,072 --> 00:52:22,562
When?

456
00:52:58,009 --> 00:53:01,104
Now, come on.
We have to keep moving.

457
00:53:52,029 --> 00:53:54,464
Nolan!

458
00:53:56,434 --> 00:53:57,367
Nolan.

459
00:53:59,804 --> 00:54:00,737
Shit

460
00:55:35,633 --> 00:55:37,032
Do you hear that?

461
00:55:41,872 --> 00:55:43,567
what are you talking about? locusts?

462
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:44,835
No.

463
00:55:44,942 --> 00:55:46,501
Just listen. It's different.

464
00:55:50,181 --> 00:55:51,740
It sounds like a car.

465
00:55:58,589 --> 00:56:00,990
Well...

466
00:56:04,295 --> 00:56:06,024
Whatever it is,

467
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:07,928
it's getting louder. Come on.

468
00:56:08,032 --> 00:56:09,500
Let's get off the road.

469
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:21,035
Is it a car?

470
00:56:23,648 --> 00:56:25,343
I don't know. I can't see it.

471
00:56:28,119 --> 00:56:29,917
Oh, shit! It's the bikers!

472
00:56:30,021 --> 00:56:30,988
The bikers?

473
00:56:39,997 --> 00:56:41,465
alice.
what?

474
00:56:43,634 --> 00:56:45,102
This may be our only chance.

475
00:56:45,202 --> 00:56:46,636
Talking

476
00:56:48,205 --> 00:56:49,969
We've been walking for hours,

477
00:56:50,074 --> 00:56:53,169
-and we haven't seen anyone.
-So we'll find someone.

478
00:56:53,277 --> 00:56:56,770
But what if this is our only chance?

479
00:56:58,082 --> 00:57:00,574
You guys stuck guns in their faces.

480
00:57:01,819 --> 00:57:05,619
Yeah, but I can explain the situation.

481
00:57:05,723 --> 00:57:07,782
Tell 'em what happened to their friends.

482
00:57:07,892 --> 00:57:09,291
They're probably looking for 'em.

483
00:57:09,393 --> 00:57:10,554
<i>Dillon, no</i>

484
00:57:12,697 --> 00:57:14,961
babe, i got to..

485
00:57:20,137 --> 00:57:21,127
But...

486
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:24,868
It's going to be okay.

487
00:57:25,009 --> 00:57:27,137
stay down.

488
00:58:10,488 --> 00:58:12,013
You guys have to help.

489
00:58:12,123 --> 00:58:13,056
Help?

490
00:58:13,157 --> 00:58:14,318
Just let me explain.

491
00:58:30,174 --> 00:58:32,165
I told you we'd get you.

492
00:58:32,276 --> 00:58:35,769
Wait. Just let me explain.

493
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:38,781
There's a guy back there killing people.

494
00:58:38,883 --> 00:58:40,874
A guy. huh?

495
00:58:40,985 --> 00:58:42,510
Yeah, a big motherfucker.

496
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:44,179
He killed your friends.

497
00:58:45,823 --> 00:58:47,086
Game again

498
00:58:47,191 --> 00:58:48,681
Your friends are dead.

499
00:58:51,195 --> 00:58:52,959
What about my wagon?

500
00:58:54,298 --> 00:58:56,665
-What?
-My wagon!

501
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:01,404
Ah, it's back at this place.

502
00:59:01,505 --> 00:59:03,496
Place? Come on, what place?

503
00:59:04,542 --> 00:59:06,874
There's this place.
We stopped. There's a tourist...

504
00:59:06,977 --> 00:59:09,469
There's this town or something.

505
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:11,207
- Where?
-lt's back there!

506
00:59:11,315 --> 00:59:15,912
We stopped, and all this weird shit
started happening.

507
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:17,681
So your friends have my wagon?

508
00:59:19,023 --> 00:59:20,184
No!

509
00:59:20,291 --> 00:59:24,319
Your guys stopped,
and this big guy, he killed 'em.

510
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,234
Where are your friends?

511
00:59:31,335 --> 00:59:33,269
They're back at this place!

512
00:59:33,370 --> 00:59:35,099
And how did you get here?

513
00:59:38,542 --> 00:59:39,805
I walked

514
00:59:44,949 --> 00:59:48,351
Listen, we need to get
the sheriff or something.

515
00:59:48,452 --> 00:59:51,114
So you're trying to tell me
that Victor and Rev are dead,

516
00:59:51,222 --> 00:59:56,160
and your friends are holed up at this
tourist place-y thing-y with my wagon.

517
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:57,193
Is that right?

518
00:59:57,328 --> 00:59:59,353
Yeah, but it's not what...

519
00:59:59,463 --> 01:00:01,522
- What? Not what?
-Not just them!

520
01:00:01,632 --> 01:00:04,499
Oh, yeah. A big guy killed
Victor and Rev. Got it.

521
01:00:04,602 --> 01:00:05,694
Yes!

522
01:00:10,074 --> 01:00:11,940
You're telling me the truth?

523
01:00:12,042 --> 01:00:13,009
Yes!

524
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:22,376
<i>Come here.
Come here.</i>

525
01:00:38,736 --> 01:00:42,570
Oh, yeah.
There is one thing, though.

526
01:00:42,673 --> 01:00:44,300
What's that?

527
01:00:52,349 --> 01:00:54,977
Nobody sticks a gun in my face.

528
01:01:10,067 --> 01:01:11,159
Dillon!

529
01:01:14,505 --> 01:01:16,030
Whoa, shit!

530
01:03:57,101 --> 01:03:59,126
it's gonna be okay, baby.

531
01:04:11,281 --> 01:04:14,307
- Just go.
-l'm not leaving you.

532
01:04:17,855 --> 01:04:20,847
No. No. You promised.

533
01:04:25,395 --> 01:04:26,885
it's... it's okay.

534
01:04:31,435 --> 01:04:34,234
- I love you, Alice.
-I love you.

535
01:04:34,338 --> 01:04:36,136
- Now go.
-No.

536
01:04:49,052 --> 01:04:51,214
You remember the wedding bells?

537
01:04:53,357 --> 01:04:55,257
You were going to be my husband,

538
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:57,293
so you can't leave me.

539
01:05:14,478 --> 01:05:16,310
Just go. Now Go.

540
01:05:18,749 --> 01:05:20,547
Don't leave me.

541
01:05:21,652 --> 01:05:23,313
Please.

542
01:06:33,390 --> 01:06:34,380
Yes!

543
01:06:47,938 --> 01:06:49,463
Come on.

544
01:06:49,573 --> 01:06:52,406
Come on. Oh! Damn it! Come on.

545
01:06:52,509 --> 01:06:55,001
Come on.
Stay there, stay there, stay there.

546
01:07:00,517 --> 01:07:02,076
I've been looking for those.

547
01:07:14,498 --> 01:07:16,728
Come on, you son of a bitch!

548
01:07:16,833 --> 01:07:17,857
Come on!

549
01:08:18,028 --> 01:08:19,120
<i>Hey! -</i>

550
01:08:28,872 --> 01:08:30,431
Wrong room.

551
01:10:21,585 --> 01:10:23,781
Alice..

552
01:10:27,190 --> 01:10:28,885
Don't worry.
I'm gonna get you out.

553
01:10:31,061 --> 01:10:32,085
Bleeding

554
01:10:34,698 --> 01:10:35,631
Where's Dillon?

555
01:10:39,703 --> 01:10:40,761
Nolan?

556
01:10:46,009 --> 01:10:47,374
We're getting the fuck out.

557
01:11:23,713 --> 01:11:24,771
Stay here.

558
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:20,166
come on..

559
01:12:45,195 --> 01:12:47,061
come on..

560
01:13:05,515 --> 01:13:08,075
Alice, it's getting dark.
We need to make it to the highway.

561
01:13:22,432 --> 01:13:23,456
Alice!

562
01:13:33,977 --> 01:13:36,571
Alice, I need you
to stay with me, okay?

563
01:13:41,151 --> 01:13:44,121
<i>Hey . Hey -.</i>

564
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:45,710
We made it this far, okay?

565
01:14:03,406 --> 01:14:04,965
Here, come on.

566
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:12,839
We're gonna make it, okay?

567
01:15:41,938 --> 01:15:43,235
Try to keep that tight.

568
01:15:45,175 --> 01:15:47,041
I'm so thirsty.

569
01:15:47,143 --> 01:15:48,611
It's the blood loss.

570
01:15:49,813 --> 01:15:51,440
You can rest,
just don't fall asleep.

571
01:16:01,724 --> 01:16:03,317
What do you think they are?

572
01:16:07,931 --> 01:16:08,921
I have no idea.

573
01:16:10,033 --> 01:16:11,797
Why would they kill Nolan?

574
01:16:24,481 --> 01:16:25,915
In the war...

575
01:16:28,218 --> 01:16:29,617
I saw things.

576
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:36,054
Things I never thought I'd see.

577
01:16:40,964 --> 01:16:43,228
Things a man can do
to another man.

578
01:16:56,312 --> 01:16:57,507
it's all right

579
01:17:13,563 --> 01:17:15,156
CSM Robart

580
01:17:16,933 --> 01:17:19,459
PFC Reynolds, myself, and two others

581
01:17:19,569 --> 01:17:21,128
were on a small recon mission.

582
01:17:22,372 --> 01:17:25,501
We came across this village
after Charlie had been there.

583
01:17:32,115 --> 01:17:35,107
The things...
things they did to those people.

584
01:17:37,887 --> 01:17:39,150
That feeling...

585
01:17:41,424 --> 01:17:43,859
That barn had the same feeling.

586
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:45,189
what are you talking about?

587
01:17:46,496 --> 01:17:47,588
Death.

588
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:52,525
After a while, you just get used to it.

589
01:17:57,273 --> 01:17:58,900
Walked by dozens of bodies

590
01:18:01,945 --> 01:18:03,845
Some with faces and some without.

591
01:18:05,448 --> 01:18:08,383
And that's how it was
most of the time I was down there.

592
01:18:09,953 --> 01:18:11,785
I can't believe Dillon's gone.

593
01:18:19,262 --> 01:18:20,696
I know.

594
01:18:25,735 --> 01:18:28,602
We had planned on
getting married last year.

595
01:18:31,407 --> 01:18:34,433
He was so excited
when he heard you were coming home.

596
01:18:35,812 --> 01:18:37,371
He wanted to wait.

597
01:18:41,818 --> 01:18:44,651
When you left, we weren't sure
you were coming back.

598
01:18:49,058 --> 01:18:50,583
I'm sorry, Alice, I didn't know that.

599
01:18:50,693 --> 01:18:52,058
I know.

600
01:18:53,997 --> 01:18:55,624
I promise you this, though.

601
01:18:58,267 --> 01:19:01,464
When we get out of here, we're gonna
blow the lid off of this place.

602
01:19:05,608 --> 01:19:07,474
His death won't be in vain, okay?

603
01:19:09,012 --> 01:19:10,878
These crazy fucks will pay.

604
01:20:01,264 --> 01:20:02,595
Come on. I got you.

605
01:20:16,579 --> 01:20:17,512
Look.

606
01:20:17,613 --> 01:20:19,274
There's a town.

607
01:20:24,020 --> 01:20:25,920
All right, come on.

608
01:20:26,022 --> 01:20:27,547
Be careful.

609
01:21:13,603 --> 01:21:15,332
Look. They're back.

610
01:21:19,208 --> 01:21:21,199
Help!

611
01:21:21,310 --> 01:21:23,301
help us!

612
01:21:23,412 --> 01:21:25,312
Anyone?

613
01:21:27,683 --> 01:21:29,082
Help!

614
01:21:52,942 --> 01:21:53,875
Hey!

615
01:21:56,212 --> 01:21:57,373
Hey, mister!

616
01:21:59,148 --> 01:22:01,549
- We really need your help.
-Alice, get back!

617
01:22:21,871 --> 01:22:22,895
<i>Alice</i>

618
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:26,472
Alice, you head north,
you gotta come across the highway.

619
01:22:26,576 --> 01:22:28,305
What are you saying?

620
01:22:28,411 --> 01:22:30,277
I'm staying behind.
-I'm staying with you.

621
01:22:32,849 --> 01:22:34,977
Listen, I can handle it.
You go. Find somebody. Anybody.

622
01:22:35,084 --> 01:22:37,178
- We can go together.
-No, there's no time.

623
01:22:37,286 --> 01:22:38,378
- Just go!
-I can't!

624
01:22:38,487 --> 01:22:40,216
You have to! Go!

625
01:22:40,323 --> 01:22:41,484
Go now!

626
01:22:45,027 --> 01:22:47,496
And no matter what you hear,
you keep going, all right?

627
01:22:47,597 --> 01:22:48,587
Go!

628
01:26:52,274 --> 01:26:53,708
Oh, shit!

629
01:29:51,654 --> 01:29:54,055
What do you think we should do, man?

630
01:29:54,156 --> 01:29:56,284
I don't know, man.
There's a town over there.
