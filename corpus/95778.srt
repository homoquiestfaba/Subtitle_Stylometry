1
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,300
The best part of a kiss, I find me,

2
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,890
it is when we see that head to approximate

3
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,680
and we noticed that in the they will give a kiss.

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,850
That needs moment previous it is delicious.

5
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:29,940
I had never felt the touch of another person of my age.

6
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,860
The sensation overstepped me.

7
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,990
I adore. I adore to kiss.

8
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:39,540
were addicted in that to interlace one in the other,

9
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,660
it wants was positive, as in the beginning, it wants negative.

10
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:47,670
I am with an intense air that it says ' I am so mysterious,

11
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:52,920
' and there is so much more to discover, that a mere glance doesn't reveal... '

12
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,760
I believe in the destiny,

13
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,930
and I believe that me and that person we will be each other.

14
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:04,140
mean to find him/it more crystalline of the mirrors,

15
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,730
and the most faithful mirror, so that, when I love that person,

16
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:11,610
I know that that love will be me returned in a reflex.

17
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,370
And there is one more thing, girl Archer.

18
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,500
If it doesn't like of Locjleigh,

19
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,130
for being a lot of húmida, or something like that,

20
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:36,340
it excuses of some time there to go.

21
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:40,050
It is not húmida, it was seen to the detail

22
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:44,340
and it is in perfect conditions, but if it doesn't please him/her,

23
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,560
it is excused to think in there to live.

24
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,020
it doesn't represent any problem, I have several houses.

25
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,230
I found for well to inform her.

26
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,690
There is who doesn't like of a ditch to the turn.

27
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:03,200
I adore them.

28
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:10,370
With certainty it noticed

29
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:14,210
that I don't fall in love easily...

30
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:18,670
but when I let to snatch me, it is for a lifetime, girl Archer.

31
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:22,050
For a lifetime.

32
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,020
it looks, it comes the girl there Archer.

33
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:40,110
No, it is going in direcção to the house.

34
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:43,900
it goes, therefore. Where is Lord Warburton?

35
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:45,570
it was with her.

36
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:49,080
Bunchie, leaves.

37
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:15,940
Gardencourt, England, 1872

38
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,660
it wants him to make him/her company to dinner, Papá?

39
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:35,370
it would have a lot of taste, but the Isabel wants to speak with me.

40
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,250
Among, my wanted.

41
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,670
Because it doesn't sit down?

42
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:03,820
My uncle...

43
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,650
I should announce him/her

44
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,200
that the Lorde Warburton it asked me in marriage.

45
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,700
I well said that you would do a lot of success for here.

46
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,710
The Americans are very appreciated,

47
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,540
and you are very beautiful, you know.

48
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:22,000
Yes, clear. I am beautiful!

49
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:34,140
It can seem of bad taste, and ingratitude...

50
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,060
but I cannot marry him.

51
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:43,610
You didn't find yours attractive proposal?

52
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,480
attractive, it was.

53
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:49,700
There was an instant in that it would have given my minimum finger to accept.

54
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:54,080
But...

55
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,410
I judge that first should obtain a general impression of the life.

56
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,330
understand?

57
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,550
There is a light that should blunt.

58
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:12,260
I cannot explain to him/it, but I know that it exists.

59
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,640
I am not afraid, does it know?

60
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:24,020
it is a very different man, it receives 100.000 pounds a year,

61
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,190
it has six houses to inhabit,

62
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,820
and a place in the Parliament as the one that I have to my table.

63
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:37,580
I wait for not having proposed plus,

64
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,210
leave me very disturbed.

65
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,460
Isabel, your uncle is all the right.

66
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:47,250
You cannot go to London without a decent companion.

67
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,050
My friend Henrietta will go with me.

68
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,890
Your friend is given to the boémia,

69
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:56,430
and he will want to accommodate in a pension.

70
00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:01,770
Ralph enrolled you in his/her club. With him, you can go the the whole side.

71
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,480
But it swims here is decent!...

72
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,770
it likes to be a lot independent, the girl...

73
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,900
I like, yes.

74
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:14,950
I cannot hope you proceed always my pieces of advice,

75
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,700
but as you neither have father nor mother,

76
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,290
I hope you listen to them.

77
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,930
I will adore or to hate your friend journalist?

78
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,100
Little it will import him/her of a form or doutra.

79
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:46,310
She is not grated with the one that the men think of her.

80
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,440
- Will it be that will interview myself? - You are not sufficiently important.

81
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,740
Henrietta!

82
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:10,880
- That sad. - Morbid, it is not?

83
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,850
When I wrote you of Liverpool,

84
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:25,350
it said that it had a thing special to tell you.

85
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,560
You still didn't ask me what is.

86
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,110
Will it be for you suspect?

87
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:36,610
to suspect the something? What do have to tell me?

88
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,700
What has to count is you concerning your American admirer.

89
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:45,330
Mr. Goodwood came with me in the steam.

90
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,500
That well say.

91
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:54,720
- It came behind you. - What to was he said?

92
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:59,850
No. He didn't tell me anything.

93
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,100
- But I spoke a lot about you. - I lament that have him/it done.

94
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:07,480
I made him/it with pleasure. I like the way as it listened.

95
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:14,280
it was so quiet, so attentive.

96
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,400
it drank my words.

97
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:20,570
It already esteems me in surplus, you should not encourage him/it.

98
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,990
it is dead for being encouraged.

99
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,580
I am to see his/her face

100
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:34,960
and his/her glance while we spoke.

101
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:38,340
I never saw an ugly man to seem so attractive.

102
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:45,020
He is a simple one, and it is not like this so ugly.

103
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:50,020
Your cousin doesn't make anything else except walking of hands in the pockets?

104
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,520
What does make it him in the life?

105
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,570
it is very sick, it cannot work.

106
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:59,700
Don't believe in that. I work when I am sick.

107
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:06,290
would like of exhibiting. It would be a beautiful specimen.

108
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,420
The Papá and me morámos here when he worked in the bank,

109
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,460
now we didn't serve ourselves of her.

110
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:21,550
I adore this height of the day, when it begins to darken.

111
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,180
You not?

112
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,720
Ralph?

113
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,110
Can I light a cigarette?

114
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:38,780
You can make him/it that you aprouver, since you have fun.

115
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:48,870
That you had you in the idea, when did you refuse Warburton?

116
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,250
it gave me license of revealing you that millstone counted.

117
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,130
didask you for you speak to me?

118
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:03,220
No, that not. It told me because it could not avoid him/it.

119
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,310
We are old friends and he felt sorry.

120
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,150
That it had me in the idea when did I refuse him/it?

121
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,030
That logic dictated such unusual acção?

122
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:24,110
- Unusual reason? - The man hardly has defects.

123
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,620
refused him/it for being too perfect.

124
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:37,000
If of this to Warburton your final answer, I am happy.

125
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:41,670
It is not for you, and much less for him, clear...

126
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,010
I am happy for me.

127
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,180
intend to ask me in marriage?

128
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,770
refer to the joy that I will have

129
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:01,690
when observing what does a damsel that it refuses the Lorde Warburton.

130
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:09,330
which did ask the logic? I explain.

131
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:16,000
- It is that cannot escape to my destiny. - Destiny?

132
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,550
My destiny is not to give up.

133
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:23,380
Is to marry with Warburton to give up?

134
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:27,090
It is a good proposal, but it means to lose other opportunities.

135
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,180
something opportunities?

136
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:33,560
I don't refer to the opportunities to marry, but...

137
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:40,360
to the one of the life. To give up of the opportunities and dangers.

138
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:51,870
- You answered to my question. - it told you very a little.

139
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:54,410
But it was the most important.

140
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,370
That the world fascinates you, and that you want to dive in him.

141
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:02,130
- it didn't say anything of that. - You wanted to say him/it, don't deny.

142
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:04,380
It is so splendid.

143
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,520
There it is him, Great Santini.

144
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:23,530
Release!

145
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:26,150
Release!

146
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,850
How did it know that I was here?

147
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:58,060
The girl Stacjpole informed me.

148
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:03,110
It was cruelty of his/her part.

149
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,700
I know that it affirmed that it never again wanted to see me,

150
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,490
but I never accepted that rule.

151
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:14,080
it didn't say that it was forever...

152
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,910
Not for 5 years, then. 10 years, 20, it is the same thing.

153
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,250
Does for what wait to get it, insisting?

154
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:28,300
- Do I cause him/her a lot of rejection? - Yes.

155
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:32,510
It doesn't cause me happiness none.

156
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:36,350
It doesn't belong here in way some. Now no.

157
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:41,020
Think about me or no, but it leaves me alone.

158
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,940
Until when?

159
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:48,860
For one year, or two.

160
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,740
when? Between an and two years,

161
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:56,290
the difference is abissal.

162
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,040
say two, then.

163
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,840
it will marry with other, so certain like me to be here.

164
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,050
I don't intend to be same to the other ones.

165
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:12,300
probably, I will never get married.

166
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:17,390
If it hears rumors that I will marry, remember this...

167
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,600
and don't believe.

168
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,400
dislike to lose her/it of view.

169
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,450
Good-bye.

170
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:46,040
I love her.

171
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,410
behaved very badly with me.

172
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,210
Does it want to say that ordered him/it away?

173
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:35,460
asked him/her that it left me alone, and to you I ask for you the same, Henrietta.

174
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:41,260
If you marry you with one of here, I never again speak to you.

175
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:46,430
- Still any it asked for my hand. - It rests, that soon will make him/it.

176
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:51,400
To Annie Climber ask-lha three times in Italy.

177
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,940
To poor and insipid Annie.

178
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:58,400
Well, if Annie Climber escaped, because not have-of escaping also?

179
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:02,450
I don't believe that you/they insisted a lot with her, but with you fa-lo-ão.

180
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:09,250
Do you know where go, Isabel Archer?

181
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,540
No, and it is óptimo not to know.

182
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:16,500
You are to let to crawl for a foolishness. You make to shudder.

183
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:27,930
My father suffered an attack of the old maleita.

184
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,930
Fear to be quite serious.

185
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,520
happily, Dr. Hope is for here,

186
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,530
and I will certify myself that he comes Gardencourt.

187
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:43,950
There is a fast convoy at 2:45 o'clock

188
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,450
and you can come with me or no, as you want.

189
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:49,580
I will go with you, I will already make the suitcase.

190
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,630
I am not rested with Isabel.

191
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:03,840
I fear that marries with an European, and I intend to avoid him/it.

192
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,770
That habit has of organizing the people's life.

193
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:12,600
I want her to get married with Mr. Caspar Goodwood.

194
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,730
Vein of Boston behind her.

195
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:19,570
it was here last night.

196
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:25,820
- Here in Pratt's? - It was my outline.

197
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,330
Does she like him a lot?

198
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:34,290
it doesn't like her, it should like. He is crazy for her.

199
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:39,460
Three months ago, it implied him/her that it could accept him/it,

200
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:42,920
and it is not habit of Isabel to leave the people badly,

201
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,340
just because it changed of scenery.

202
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,760
Isabel... was it cruel?

203
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:56,270
it didn't give him/her satisfactions, it only wanted to be seen free from him.

204
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:01,400
Poor Mr. Goodwood.

205
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:39,100
The Lorde Matthew had an attack last night.

206
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,690
And I am to shock an influenza.

207
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:44,940
- Can it give me any powder? - With certainty.

208
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:49,990
A great friend arrived from Rome,

209
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:52,330
Will it take tea connosco?

210
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:50,360
It is very beautiful,

211
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:55,200
and his/her interpretation it still turns him/it more beautiful.

212
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,330
Won't I have inconvenienced Mr. Touchett?

213
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:02,290
His/her room is far and I play...

214
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:04,580
just with the tip of the fingers.

215
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:09,840
Leaning that not. I believe that to hear music so beautiful woman

216
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,470
fa-lo-á to feel better.

217
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:18,720
I fear that there are moments in the life in that nor Schubert has something to tell us.

218
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,320
Doesn't it want to play something more?

219
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,110
If it gives him/her pleasure, I will have a lot of taste.

220
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:44,290
The niece, the American youth is not?

221
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:49,290
- I am my aunt's niece. - Fortunately. We are compatriots.

222
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,420
I am the madam Merle.

223
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:58,110
Who is there it? Is my son?

224
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:01,700
Yes, it is his/her son, Papá.

225
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,750
- It is not more nobody? - More nobody.

226
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,370
A cigarette.

227
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:25,220
What should do, when I go me, it is to marry.

228
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,440
What do find of your cousin?

229
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:38,650
If I understood well, it is his/her intention what do I marry Isabel?

230
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:44,160
Well, it is that that sets up, after all. Don't you like Isabel?

231
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:48,660
A lot. I like Isabel a lot.

232
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,170
meditated a lot in this subject.

233
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:54,290
Also me. it doesn't cost to admit me him.

234
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:59,050
Are you in love of her, then? It is good that you are,

235
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:02,050
until it seems that it came on purpose.

236
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:10,190
I am not in love of her, but...

237
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:15,940
if certain things were different.

238
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:19,820
The things are always different of what they could be.

239
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:24,530
I won't live many years,

240
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:29,410
but I hope you/they arrive to see the one that Isabel does of his/her life.

241
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:34,250
would like to do something for her. To turn her rich.

242
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:38,090
- Rich, in what felt? - I consider rich a person

243
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:42,010
that it gets to accomplish the requirements of his/her imagination.

244
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:46,470
- To do the one what him aprouver? - At all.

245
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:49,730
Beautiful boy.

246
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,600
won.

247
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:55,520
quiet.

248
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:05,030
Who is this madam Merle? It is charming.

249
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,870
it plays beautifully.

250
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:12,160
- it makes everything beautifully. - You don't like her.

251
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,750
On the contrary, I was already in love of her.

252
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:19,340
And didn't she love you? Is it for that what don't like of her?

253
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,670
How could we put such subjects?

254
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:24,300
The monsieur Merle was still alive.

255
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:28,680
- Is it now is dead? - Second that she says.

256
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:33,190
- Don't you believe in her? - I believe.

257
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:37,940
It would be of waiting that the husband of the madam Merle died.

258
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:47,070
- Do I arrive late? I ask for forgiveness. - No, in way none.

259
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,540
Did it already repair that beautiful roads cross the property?

260
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:03,090
Us American we give European bad,

261
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:05,970
because we don't have own room here.

262
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:10,100
But I think, for a woman, never an own place exists.

263
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:15,440
Wherever be, it has to float, and above all to crawl.

264
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,730
I will never crawl.

265
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:21,900
Because, I don't see her/it to crawl...

266
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:25,900
And the men, the Americans?

267
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:30,780
See Ralph Touchett's poor. What illustration type does it make him?

268
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:34,000
happily, it is consumptive.

269
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,790
I say happily, because it serves him/her of occupation.

270
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:43,460
The disease is his/her career, a type of position.

271
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,180
If it didn't go so sick, it would make something.

272
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,760
would take the father's position in the bank.

273
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,260
doubt. He doesn't like the bank.

274
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,730
Good friends are not?

275
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:57,810
We are! But he doesn't esteem me.

276
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,730
What evil did do him/her?

277
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:05,030
it is not necessary to have a reason.

278
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:09,530
For not esteeming her/it of itself? It would be necessary to have a very strong one.

279
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,740
I adore the English rain.

280
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:15,910
It always falls a little, never too much at the same time.

281
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,420
It doesn't wet, and it always smells well.

282
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:24,000
That delicacy!

283
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,380
Hum, delicious!

284
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,840
Because it is!

285
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,490
Everything gave to have his/her age,

286
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:52,410
and all my life for the front.

287
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:54,740
it still has her/it for the front.

288
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:59,460
No. The best part it already left, and for anything.

289
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:04,960
- For anything, certainly it was not. - Because not? What do have me?

290
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:09,800
Nor husband, nor children, nor fortune,

291
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,720
and nor my house at least.

292
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,640
What would like to do, what has not already made?

293
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,190
I am very ambitious.

294
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:29,950
For me, it represents the image of the success.

295
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:38,830
My dreams were grandiose.

296
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:47,380
Faria a ridiculous illustration if it spoke about them.

297
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:52,050
would like him to be with this.

298
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:53,720
I will visit six different places,

299
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:58,720
and I know that I won't find anybody of who likes as much as of itself.

300
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:20,720
He left me this house, but naturally I will never inhabit her.

301
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:24,480
I have a much better in Florence, as you know.

302
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,730
And Ralph is with Gardencourt.

303
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:34,280
calm, there is a notable clause in the will of my husband.

304
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,160
Do I order to do tea?

305
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:40,450
it left a fortune to my niece.

306
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,830
A fortune?

307
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:49,590
Isabel inherits about 70.000 pounds.

308
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:57,090
intelligent creature.

309
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:02,470
Florence

310
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:25,370
it seems to be very delicate.

311
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:39,010
It is really beautiful.

312
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:43,850
When the mother died, I sent you my daughter so that they educated her.

313
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:45,970
I had faith, they know.

314
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:49,980
She is perfect, it doesn't have defects.

315
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:53,570
have the connosco from little.

316
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:56,940
It is not right that lose her.

317
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:01,780
For very good that it is, it is not like us. It was cut for the world.

318
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:05,910
Nothing is still decided.

319
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,810
Only in the color it is that you/they differ, nun.

320
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:34,730
So much have in a branch as in the other.

321
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:44,490
- Is here anybody? - It is. Somebody that you can see.

322
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:48,290
- Madam Merle. - I came to give you the welcomes.

323
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,460
Cannot I go to the coach?

324
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:55,710
preferred that you were here with me.

325
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:05,430
I hope you/they see you use gloves.

326
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,100
The girls as you dislike them.

327
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:12,230
That was formerly, now taste of them.

328
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:15,520
will give you a dozen, of present.

329
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:19,940
- And will they be very beautiful? - Not in surplus.

330
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:27,200
She will offer some gloves.

331
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:32,960
It is your a lot of kindness,
but it already has everything that needs.

332
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,830
I would say that it already owes to be fed up with nuns.

333
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:38,170
If we will talk about that, she should leave.

334
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:40,800
we will speak about other things.

335
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:48,180
wanted, you are going to the garden to pick a flower for our friend?

336
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,930
It is quite so that I want do.

337
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:09,950
I want you to make a thing when you are in Florence.

338
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:19,670
I have a person there becomes friends that I want that you know.

339
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:21,960
That it serves me that?

340
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,050
will amuse you.

341
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:35,140
- If at least you made an effort... - Ah, very well.

342
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,350
it already knew that will upset me.

343
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:42,650
Of who here comes to stop, will there be anybody what deserves the effort?

344
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,870
Be not foolish, Osmond.

345
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,950
The person with whom I came to meet...

346
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:59,210
it is a niece of Mrs. Touchett.

347
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:05,800
it is a 23 year-old youth. I met her in England six months ago.

348
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,180
I like her vastly.

349
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:14,980
And, what is rarer for me,

350
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:18,150
admire her.

351
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,110
You will make the same.

352
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,570
- Only if it cannot avoid him/it. - And you won't be able to.

353
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:31,990
It is beautiful, smart, rich, splendid,

354
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:36,580
universally intelligent, and virtuous incondicionalmente?

355
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:39,460
Just in those terms it would want to know her.

356
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:43,710
I already know a lot of common people, I don't want to know more.

357
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:46,010
The girl Archer is not common.

358
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,140
fill out all your requirements.

359
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:55,970
- More or less, clear. - Not. Literally.

360
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:12,740
What do intend to do with her?

361
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:21,790
What sees. To put her/it in your road.

362
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,840
Doesn't it deserve something better?

363
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,840
I don't know what deserve the people,

364
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,590
I only know what can do of them.

365
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:36,680
Poor girl Archer.

366
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:41,690
If that is interest for her, volume note.

367
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:43,810
You are with good air.

368
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:49,320
You always have good air when you have an idea.

369
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:53,160
are you always well.

370
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:02,330
Let's hope you didn't go so cold.

371
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:06,500
it always harmed you, and it will harm you now.

372
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:09,260
I am not as cold as judge.

373
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:15,140
Once in a while, something plays me.

374
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:18,640
As that that you ambition for me.

375
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:23,520
Because it must be interested the niece of Mrs. Touchett, if...

376
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,480
Do I raise interest so a little?

377
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,320
It was not that that wanted say.

378
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,820
If I knew and I appreciated a woman like you.

379
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:39,370
Isabel Archer is better than I.

380
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:09,440
Did you already see the last ones what did?

381
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:12,950
That is not a sketch of last year?

382
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:17,030
- That what made in Spain? - I already got better very ever since.

383
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,330
I don't like your drawings.

384
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:21,870
They are much better than the one of the other ones.

385
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:27,040
But as only occupation, is a little.

386
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:31,880
it saw you to do so much other things, my ambitions.

387
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:35,840
- Impossible things. - Impossible things.

388
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,400
Your room, that is perfect.

389
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,980
frighten me whenever here I return.

390
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:52,070
You have very good taste.

391
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,990
I am fed up with my good taste.

392
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:01,870
You have to bring the girl here Archer.

393
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:08,420
As guide of your own museum, you become very attractive.

394
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:14,300
did say that it was rich?

395
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:19,970
No there is doubt that has fortune.

396
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:49,580
Do you think it does me well to be so rich?

397
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:51,540
Henrietta doesn't think so.

398
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:56,420
Henrietta that deteriorates. If you want to know, I am charmed.

399
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:00,300
Did you know that your father intended to leave me so much money?

400
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:03,930
What does import it? It was very obstinate.

401
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:06,390
Then you did know?

402
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,230
Yes, it told me.

403
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:12,770
As it knew if I would give good use to such a big fortune?

404
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:15,480
How did it know that I am not weak?

405
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:18,990
Don't question so much what is good or bad for you.

406
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:23,280
it lives as you more aprouver, that your carácter will make the rest.

407
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:27,040
I doubt that you measure well your words,

408
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:31,250
because, if you make him/it, you take a lot of responsibility.

409
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:58,940
The facade is of the century XVI, but the interior is older.

410
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:07,700
Osmond rarely invites me,

411
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:11,170
I am that I remembered to come here today.

412
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:15,290
I like to know new people, and I am right that it is very new.

413
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:19,920
If it doesn't sit down there, that chair is not what seems.

414
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,390
There are good seats here,

415
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:26,810
but there are also some horrors. Pee!

416
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:28,640
I don't see nenhuns.

417
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,810
Everything I think beautiful and precious.

418
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:35,690
thank you. I have some good things.

419
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:38,940
In fact, I don't have very bad.

420
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:42,610
Poor Osmond, with their reposteiros and crucifixes.

421
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:46,700
Doesn't it want a tea? it should be tired.

422
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:50,330
I am not. What did make me that it got tired?

423
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:55,920
It will be tired when it goes home, if he shows him/her the trinkets,

424
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,800
and it gives him/her a lecture for each one.

425
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,130
But I will have learned something.

426
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,680
can be liked or not of a thing,

427
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,260
but not to question the reason it gave taste.

428
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:11,180
Some good feelings, are they very bad rights, doesn't it find?

429
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:14,900
it is a beautiful day. Will we walk?

430
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:21,030
And there are also bad feelings, that you/they are very good rights.

431
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:24,030
This hill is impossible...

432
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:26,990
It is not pleasant to hear gasping of our mounted one.

433
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:30,330
Girl Archer, what does of my sister find?

434
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,710
Don't ask me that question.

435
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:40,960
Little was with her.

436
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:43,760
Yes, that is true, but...

437
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,760
I like to know that it idealizes does of her a fresh mind and without prejudices.

438
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:56,230
Per times I find that we are badly habituated,

439
00:46:56,310 --> 00:47:00,940
living here between people and things that you/they are not ours.

440
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:08,320
it is quite unhappy and not being her a serious person,

441
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:12,950
it doesn't demonstrate him/it dramatically, but yes laughably.

442
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:20,040
Does it want him to lower that picture? it needs more light.

443
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:36,730
This was one of the first pictures that I bought in Italy.

444
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:40,610
were enough to see me once the girl, that I liked her soon.

445
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:41,860
Me also.

446
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:45,070
That strange way of showing him/it.

447
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:47,030
advise her the if it doesn't afflict.

448
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:50,570
The case involves three people stronger than you.

449
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:55,160
Three people? You and Osmond, clear.

450
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:58,000
But the girl Archer is very strong?

451
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,960
As much as us.

452
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:06,220
They are capable of everything, you and Osmond. They are dangerous.

453
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:08,720
Then it is better to leave us in peace.

454
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:14,850
The madam Merle said that it had plans of traveling for the world.

455
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:19,980
I am embarrassed of my plans.

456
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:22,730
Everyday I make a new one.

457
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:26,490
Because it would owe if it embarrasses? it is the largest of the pleasures.

458
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:30,160
I made one there are years ago, and still today follow him/it.

459
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:34,030
it must have given a lot of pleasure.

460
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:36,910
And it gave. A very simple plan.

461
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:40,170
It was to be the quietest possible.

462
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:49,970
Not to worry,not to make an effort or to struggle.

463
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:53,390
to be satisfied with very a little.

464
00:48:56,140 --> 00:49:01,270
Wide years I started to accomplish him/it and I don't have myself given badly.

465
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:10,610
feel more civilized for speaking with itself...

466
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:17,740
but soon it will leave, and we won't see each other more.

467
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:21,710
It is like this, to live at a tourist country.

468
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:26,800
it already had occasion of walking for Florence?

469
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:35,300
calm, you that know everything...

470
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:38,810
That finds strange creature walks to do the cut to my niece?

471
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:46,110
Gilbert Osmond? Credo, that idealizes...

472
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:49,940
Had not it happened you?

473
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:53,610
It came here five times in two weeks.

474
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:59,830
feel very foolish, but I should admit that not.

475
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:02,120
Will it have happened to Isabel?

476
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:03,870
I will ask him/her.

477
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:07,170
Don't give him/her ideas. it asks Mr. Osmond before.

478
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:12,130
I am not able to. I don't want him/it to interrogate me with that air.

479
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:14,180
ask him/her me.

480
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:18,260
investigate, and I swallow you the report.

481
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:22,520
She is very capable of marrying with him for their opinions,

482
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:25,520
or for Miguel Ângelo's autograph.

483
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:46,330
With license.

484
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:01,140
it wants me to go with her Caparola.

485
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:13,190
- What do go with her? - While she there is.

486
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,740
She is that it proposed him/it. But I gave him/her the opportunity.

487
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:21,240
I don't work a lot in knowing him/it, but you don't sing victory already.

488
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:24,120
Of course goes.

489
00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:28,580
it will give me work, your idea.

490
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:30,750
Don't fake that you don't like.

491
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:38,050
caused very good impression, and I see that it is reciprocal.

492
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:41,260
So many visits his/her house they were not alone to please me.

493
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:45,180
The girl is not unpleasant. it just has a defect.

494
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:48,230
- Which is? - Too much ideas.

495
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,610
informed you that it was smart.

496
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:54,110
happily, they are whole very bad.

497
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:58,110
- Happily, reason? - Anything if it loses with his/her sacrifice.

498
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:07,960
You are unfathomable.

499
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:10,170
scare me the abyss in that I threw her.

500
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:13,630
Now you cannot retreat. You went too far.

501
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:18,800
Very well. But you will make the rest.

502
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,600
It is incredible. This whole work,

503
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:25,470
and they paid them a trifle for him.

504
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:29,980
forgot about the parasol. I will return.

505
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,150
- I go. - It is not necessary.

506
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:35,650
- Does it want to take a coffee? - Yes, thank you.

507
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:23,910
Then it did decide to come?

508
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:25,870
arrived last night.

509
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,250
The others are up there.

510
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:37,460
I didn't come for the other ones. I came to say good-bye.

511
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:41,510
Who knows if it will return? Anything she forces.

512
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:44,600
- Does it find my ridiculous trips? - Not.

513
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:47,760
Go the the whole side, make everything.

514
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:51,560
Be happy, be triumphant.

515
00:53:55,190 --> 00:54:00,240
- What does with triumphant mean? - To do that that pleases him/her.

516
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:07,530
To do the things that it pleases us for vanity it can be tiresome.

517
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:09,290
Exactlly, one day will get tired.

518
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:14,580
I don't know if it waits there

519
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:17,290
to tell him/her a thing.

520
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:22,970
I am not able to aconselhá-lho without to know that is.

521
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:27,010
- I am horrible when I am tired. - I don't believe.

522
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:30,390
sometimes get annoyed, that believes,

523
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:32,230
but I know that it is never horrible.

524
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:35,690
Nor when do I lose the judgement?

525
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:37,770
The judgement doesn't get lost, it is.

526
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:40,690
And that should be beautiful.

527
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,410
If at least it could find him/it now.

528
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:53,790
it doesn't scare me.

529
00:54:56,750 --> 00:55:00,210
crossed the arms and it was to admire her.

530
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:08,510
The one that wanted say him it is that to I love.

531
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:11,520
- No, that is better to wait. - Not.

532
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:14,350
it can give me heard now or never,

533
00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:17,600
but in any way I should say him/it.

534
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:20,820
I am quite in love of itself.

535
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:25,400
- Don't say that, please. - it won't have importance for itself.

536
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:29,780
I don't possess fame, nor fortune, nor anything to offer.

537
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:33,910
I judge until being happy for we will separate.

538
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,460
If it didn't leave now, I would know myself better.

539
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:39,540
it will be for again.

540
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:46,930
There is only a more thing. A small favor that I ask him/her.

541
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,600
Childbirth for Rome inside of days.

542
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:53,850
it will visit my daughter before leaving of Florence?

543
00:55:56,980 --> 00:56:00,230
Yes, with certainty.

544
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:52,370
Isabel!

545
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:55,950
Isabel, are you there in low?

546
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:01,750
Your coffee is to cool!

547
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:07,010
- Do you get to see her there in low? - It is dark.

548
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:11,800
Hello.

549
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:23,730
They are the most beautiful gardens of the world.

550
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:29,240
It is not that I have state for everyone.

551
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:37,040
The Papá says that while he is out should not pass of this line.

552
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:43,960
- Your father that said? - it thinks that can burn.

553
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:52,630
Here. it shares my parasol.

554
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:04,520
What was?

555
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:14,280
You should do what your father says.

556
00:58:16,490 --> 00:58:19,330
it will never ask you that you make anything of foolish.

557
00:58:33,090 --> 00:58:36,180
My Trip

558
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:11,300
There it is.

559
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:20,510
Eight, nine, ten. Pardon. No, not.

560
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:33,360
What wants saying is that I am quite in love of itself.

561
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:43,450
I am quite in love of itself.

562
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:51,840
I am quite in love of itself.

563
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,670
I am quite in love of itself.

564
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:02,510
I am quite in love of itself.

565
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:08,690
I am quite in love of itself.

566
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:19,280
Florence, one year later

567
01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:14,090
Nor it imagines as I wanted that it didn't come.

568
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:22,390
I don't doubt.

569
01:01:25,970 --> 01:01:29,060
I informed him that it would do what wanted.

570
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:34,020
it wanted him to explain to me what took her/it to change of ideas.

571
01:01:34,110 --> 01:01:37,360
Does it think I owe him/her explanations?

572
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:40,610
It was very favorable. I believed.

573
01:01:44,870 --> 01:01:49,250
I didn't deceive him. it was not committed.

574
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:54,420
When I read his/her letter, I judged that could be a mistake.

575
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:58,460
There is no mistake none.

576
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:07,350
I did what wanted. 578

577
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:12,060
I saw her. 579

578
01:02:31,370 --> 01:02:34,540
it wants to say that came just to look me?

579
01:03:17,290 --> 01:03:19,090
You didn't come to eat lunch.

580
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:25,680
I am not hungry. 582

581
01:03:27,590 --> 01:03:31,180
You should eat. You live of the air.

582
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:39,020
I still didn't congratulate you.

583
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:45,900
found strange that silence.

584
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:50,990
I didn't recompose myself of the surprise since my mother told me.

585
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:54,000
You are the last that I hoped to see captured.

586
01:03:56,330 --> 01:03:59,170
I don't know because you say ' captured '.

587
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:08,470
You will be put in a cage.

588
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:11,850
If it likes of my cage, you don't have to worry.

589
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:22,610
it had built a charming vision of your future.

590
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:29,910
had entertained myself the planear a high purpose for you.

591
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:32,740
It would not include anything of this género.

592
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:36,790
You would not let to fall so easily.

593
01:04:36,830 --> 01:04:41,840
- ' To abate '? - It hurts me.

594
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:46,260
hurt me, as if it was me to fall her.

595
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:52,810
I don't understand you.

596
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:59,100
I would say that the man for you it would have a more nature...

597
01:04:59,190 --> 01:05:03,110
activa, wide and free.

598
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:10,160
I don't adjust to the sensation that Osmond is something...

599
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,450
601

600
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:19,710
- ' Small '. - I find him/it short. Selfish.

601
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:21,880
are taken very seriously to him own.

602
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:27,840
- He is the image of the good taste. - His/her taste is excellent.

603
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,720
You already saw a taste like this,

604
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:32,180
excellent, when is it contradicted?

605
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:36,220
I never hope to lack to the good taste of my husband.

606
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:43,940
That is óptimo. It is formidable!

607
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:47,860
It is it that all the wives they should want.

608
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:51,030
But you were not destined to do something better than to take care

609
01:05:51,110 --> 01:05:53,820
of an amateur's sensibility?

610
01:05:57,790 --> 01:06:00,460
it said what left in the soul.

611
01:06:03,830 --> 01:06:06,300
said him/it because I love you.

612
01:06:07,090 --> 01:06:09,420
Then you are an interested part.

613
01:06:15,010 --> 01:06:17,140
love you, but without hope.

614
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:27,320
I see Mr. Osmond in another way.

615
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:30,940
it is not person important, or rich,

616
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:36,370
and it doesn't have title, honors or lands.

617
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,950
If to that you refer when calling him/her small,

618
01:06:39,950 --> 01:06:44,460
him be-the really. I call that to be big.

619
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:48,590
It is the largest greatness that I know.

620
01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:54,050
it has him/it more gentile,

621
01:06:54,130 --> 01:06:58,640
the kindest and light of the spirits.

622
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:03,640
You do a wrong idea of him.

623
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:08,610
It is feather not to change her.

624
01:07:32,050 --> 01:07:34,970
They think that I only want his/her money.

625
01:07:34,970 --> 01:07:37,140
How do you know him/it what think?

626
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:39,430
You didn't tell me that you/they are happy,

627
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:42,980
and if they were, they demonstrated him/it.

628
01:07:44,350 --> 01:07:46,440
It only imports me a thing -

629
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:49,190
that you don't have doubt shadow.

630
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:51,480
You know that no, nor a shadow.

631
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:54,740
Never in my life I tried to win a cash,

632
01:07:54,740 --> 01:07:57,200
and it should be more above suspicion

633
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,780
that who delves into and it collects.

634
01:07:59,870 --> 01:08:04,960
I won't fake that I lament that you are rich. I am charmed.

635
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:07,500
Per times I wanted to kneel down

636
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:10,130
in my uncle's gravestone, to thank him/her.

637
01:08:10,210 --> 01:08:12,800
to love you it turned me in a better man.

638
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,760
I am not it failed that it judged to be.

639
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:19,970
I had success in two things: I will marry with the woman that I adore,

640
01:08:20,050 --> 01:08:23,930
and I got to educate my daughter to the old fashion.

641
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:27,900
It will be entertaining we create a vidinha for her.

642
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:37,360
Rome, three years later

643
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:14,530
What more it has, besides their Spanish incomes and of the service of tea?

644
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:16,860
My colecção is appreciated,

645
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:19,740
and I have a small income...

646
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:23,620
about 40.000 francs a year.

647
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:26,870
The girl Osmond and me we lived beautifully with that.

648
01:09:26,950 --> 01:09:30,120
beautifully? No.

649
01:09:30,210 --> 01:09:35,090
modestly, yes. His/her father cannot give him/her a gift.

650
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:38,670
He lives abastadamente.

651
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:43,140
The money belongs to the woman. it brought him/her a great fortune.

652
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:45,560
Mrs. Osmond esteems the stepdaughter a lot,

653
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:47,640
maybe help.

654
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:52,270
For a passionate man, it is very lucid.

655
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:58,740
probably, it will want the money for their own children.

656
01:09:58,740 --> 01:10:03,120
Their children? Certainly that it doesn't have them.

657
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:04,530
it can still have them.

658
01:10:05,450 --> 01:10:09,330
it had a poor rapazito that it died there are almost two years.

659
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:12,790
lament a lot.

660
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:17,210
it is an amazing woman.

661
01:10:23,430 --> 01:10:27,140
I don't say that his/her proposal be of the best,

662
01:10:27,220 --> 01:10:29,560
but it could be worse.

663
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:34,650
however, his/her father will judge to be capable to arrange better.

664
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:39,820
For him maybe, but...

665
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:43,610
the best for his/her daughter it is to marry with the man that loves.

666
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:45,410
And it loves me.

667
01:10:45,530 --> 01:10:51,580
- However, I speak to Mrs. Osmond. - Not.

668
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:54,580
Don't put her/it in agitation, or else it destroys everything.

669
01:10:54,670 --> 01:10:57,170
His/her husband will be doutra opinion.

670
01:10:57,250 --> 01:11:02,090
advise him/it to not to increase the discord points among them.

671
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:06,800
Don't play in the subject until me to have made some surveys.

672
01:11:06,890 --> 01:11:08,310
Don't I play in the subject?

673
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:11,980
But I am passionate!

674
01:11:13,390 --> 01:11:15,440
it doesn't die...

675
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:40,110
- Where is Pansy? - It already went down.

676
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,780
detested his/her proposal.

677
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:38,660
I made him to see that, and I was abrupt on purpose.

678
01:13:39,410 --> 01:13:41,330
tell him/her that you need time.

679
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:44,670
Don't make that, that he is to the wait.

680
01:13:44,750 --> 01:13:46,960
dislike to speak with asses.

681
01:13:51,050 --> 01:13:55,720
He is a gentleman. it has a charming workmanship,

682
01:13:57,220 --> 01:13:59,560
and a comfortable income.

683
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:02,310
It is a poverty. A noble poverty.

684
01:14:02,350 --> 01:14:04,940
It was not what I dreamed for Pansy.

685
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:07,820
happily, I am not unaware.

686
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:10,610
educated her for this,

687
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:11,990
everything this,

688
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:14,950
for, in the case of appearing a situation of these,

689
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:17,580
she to accept my decision.

690
01:14:28,010 --> 01:14:31,630
They never treated me like this. I don't know what have against me.

691
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:33,340
Used to be disrespect.

692
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:37,850
- It could already have married me 20 times. - it doesn't have means for Pansy.

693
01:14:37,850 --> 01:14:42,100
- She is not interested in money. - No, but his/her father is interested.

694
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:44,980
Because, of that it knows you.

695
01:14:58,370 --> 01:15:03,250
offended her, and now no longer it helps me.

696
01:15:04,210 --> 01:15:08,880
It is not because it doesn't want. I am not able to.

697
01:15:14,550 --> 01:15:19,810
- Isabel, I swallow you an old friend. - Lord Warburton.

698
01:15:19,930 --> 01:15:22,640
arrived this late.

699
01:15:22,730 --> 01:15:25,980
it knew that you/they would be home on Thursday, therefore I came.

700
01:15:26,810 --> 01:15:30,980
The fame of your Thursdays England arrived.

701
01:15:35,570 --> 01:15:39,540
- We are very flattered. - I am very happy in seeing her.

702
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:45,580
let to already tell him/her to me that it brought Ralph Touchett with me.

703
01:15:46,630 --> 01:15:49,040
it didn't come, it was at the hotel.

704
01:15:49,130 --> 01:15:53,260
- It was too tired to come. - Because he came to Rome?

705
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:58,680
it is very badly, Mrs. Osmond. it doesn't get to maintain hot.

706
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:02,430
The more for south we come, minus he seats the cold.

707
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:04,980
If it allows me, I think this was the worst height

708
01:16:04,980 --> 01:16:08,400
for Mrs. Touchett to go to America.

709
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:15,280
Do you know him/it what your father told me?

710
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:18,950
Don't speak loudly, they are going all to hear.

711
01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:21,700
it said that you already forgot me.

712
01:16:21,790 --> 01:16:25,620
No. I didn't forget you.

713
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:32,340
Is everything in the same?

714
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:36,260
In the same, not. The Papá was very severe.

715
01:16:36,340 --> 01:16:40,220
- it prohibited me of marrying with you. - Do you have to give him/her ears?

716
01:16:41,140 --> 01:16:43,930
I cannot disobey to the Papá.

717
01:16:44,020 --> 01:16:46,270
And do you sacrifice me like this?

718
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:52,730
I love you as much as always.

719
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:55,110
That it serves me that?

720
01:16:56,900 --> 01:17:01,990
Don't say anything else. The Papá it doesn't want him to speak more to you.

721
01:17:02,870 --> 01:17:04,790
It is too much.

722
01:17:10,790 --> 01:17:14,460
- Can I introduce him/it to the people? - Please it doesn't make him/it.

723
01:17:15,670 --> 01:17:18,630
Unless it is to that young one seating to the table.

724
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:20,550
it has a charming face.

725
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:24,010
- it is the daughter of my husband. - That beautiful girl.

726
01:17:24,010 --> 01:17:26,560
- it has that to know. - Inside of moments.

727
01:17:29,350 --> 01:17:31,520
I like of observing of here.

728
01:17:36,940 --> 01:17:41,370
it knows, it changed a lot.

729
01:17:41,450 --> 01:17:43,660
Yes, enough.

730
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:45,950
I don't say that it went to worst, clear.

731
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,500
But how to say that went for better?

732
01:18:15,070 --> 01:18:17,650
I think after all am not going to Sicily.

733
01:18:17,730 --> 01:18:21,860
- Don't you go? - Where will you go then?

734
01:18:25,740 --> 01:18:29,290
- I think to side none. - Will you return England?

735
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:32,830
No, I will be in Rome.

736
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:36,500
- Rome doesn't serve you. - Rome is very cold.

737
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:38,380
Here I settle.

738
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:45,510
- I recommend that you try Sicily. - I won't try. I don't have forces.

739
01:18:45,510 --> 01:18:49,680
I don't get to face the trip. And I don't have there nor a cousin.

740
01:18:51,350 --> 01:18:53,100
What does the doctor say?

741
01:18:57,150 --> 01:18:59,650
I didn't ask, I am me in the paints.

742
01:18:59,740 --> 01:19:02,910
To die here, they bury me.

743
01:19:02,990 --> 01:19:04,410
You won't die here.

744
01:19:16,670 --> 01:19:19,460
I don't believe that she is so cold.

745
01:19:19,550 --> 01:19:22,510
it is very changed. It was Osmond.

746
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:42,190
you ask her for the doctor's opinion.

747
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:47,280
The doctor's opinion destroyed everything.

748
01:19:47,370 --> 01:19:50,410
You will sacrifice the health to your curiosity?

749
01:19:50,490 --> 01:19:52,540
The health I don't concern a lot.

750
01:19:52,620 --> 01:19:58,000
- I concern a lot Mrs. Osmond. - To me also.

751
01:19:58,090 --> 01:19:59,670
Not as much as it already interested.

752
01:20:09,390 --> 01:20:13,350
if it is to enhance that facto

753
01:20:13,430 --> 01:20:16,650
what did go so nice for the small?

754
01:20:16,730 --> 01:20:19,150
Did that seem you ridiculous?

755
01:20:20,150 --> 01:20:22,530
There is a difference of ages, clear.

756
01:20:22,610 --> 01:20:24,360
More than 20 years.

757
01:20:25,860 --> 01:20:29,620
My dear Warburton, speeches seriously?

758
01:20:33,290 --> 01:20:34,870
As much as it is necessary.

759
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:46,130
Fortunately. And God knows as that will encourage Osmond.

760
01:20:46,220 --> 01:20:50,140
Don't destroy everything. Do you think she will be happy?

761
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:54,680
- The small? Charmed, clear. - No, Mrs. Osmond.

762
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:30,470
The Lorde Warburton was here.

763
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:35,350
Yes. it was here half hour.

764
01:21:38,730 --> 01:21:43,650
- Did he speak to Pansy? - it almost only spoke to her.

765
01:21:50,570 --> 01:21:53,830
I think very kind.

766
01:21:53,910 --> 01:21:55,700
Doesn't it seem you?

767
01:21:55,790 --> 01:21:59,960
I don't have to seem. I leave the opinions for you.

768
01:22:00,670 --> 01:22:02,670
give in the license?

769
01:22:18,980 --> 01:22:22,190
Here is a consideration that not always you demonstrate.

770
01:22:25,150 --> 01:22:29,440
This time, it had decided to act how you wanted.

771
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:40,370
Are you to want to discuss with me?

772
01:22:40,460 --> 01:22:44,130
No, I am to try to live in peace.

773
01:22:44,210 --> 01:22:48,710
It is a óptima resolution. Your génio have not been good.

774
01:22:53,050 --> 01:22:57,180
Therefore, I didn't speak to you in my daughter's subject.

775
01:22:58,180 --> 01:23:00,770
it feared to find opposition.

776
01:23:08,730 --> 01:23:12,990
I ordered small Rosier to his/her life.

777
01:23:13,070 --> 01:23:16,700
To my daughter, it is enough to be him/her very quiet

778
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:18,990
to be Lady Warburton.

779
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:22,750
Maybe be not very quiet...

780
01:23:23,670 --> 01:23:27,210
it gets lost Mr. Rosier, it can riot.

781
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,010
Pansy wants to be a great lady,

782
01:23:31,090 --> 01:23:34,180
and it wants above all to please.

783
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:40,850
- To please Mr. Rosier, maybe. - No, to please me.

784
01:23:50,650 --> 01:23:54,860
however, it would like that our different visitor if it manifested.

785
01:23:57,070 --> 01:23:58,950
it already made him/it.

786
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:02,540
told me that it would have a lot of pleasure

787
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:05,040
if she could love him.

788
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:09,960
- Because you didn't tell me? - I didn't have opportunity.

789
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:16,720
- You know how we lived. - Because it didn't speak to me him?

790
01:24:17,970 --> 01:24:22,140
You have to be patient. English are shy.

791
01:24:22,220 --> 01:24:25,060
This was not, when it made you the cut.

792
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:28,360
How do you say? it went him and enough.

793
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:30,270
understand.

794
01:24:33,490 --> 01:24:36,910
You should have a lot of influence in him.

795
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:39,660
I know that, badly want,

796
01:24:39,660 --> 01:24:41,910
you take him/it to declare.

797
01:24:52,130 --> 01:24:53,710
Well...

798
01:24:58,550 --> 01:25:02,180
It is in your hands, and there it will be.

799
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:07,100
With a little willingly, you will get.

800
01:25:07,690 --> 01:25:09,610
it thinks about that,

801
01:25:11,730 --> 01:25:14,030
and it reminds you that story with you.

802
01:26:33,650 --> 01:26:37,070
pansies (pansies), they should belong to her.

803
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:39,900
Yes, give-millstones to hold.

804
01:26:40,950 --> 01:26:42,610
Can I catch them?

805
01:26:45,410 --> 01:26:47,370
Can I be with a flower?

806
01:26:52,580 --> 01:26:55,130
The things that I do for itself!

807
01:27:03,010 --> 01:27:05,510
Don't put her/it in the lapel!

808
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:10,350
it feels sorry for me...

809
01:27:12,140 --> 01:27:14,400
... but doesn't it have any feather of her?

810
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:52,480
promised me later a dance.

811
01:27:53,270 --> 01:27:56,020
did ask for him/her the ' cotillon '?

812
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:59,570
I didn't ask him/her that. It is a ' quadrille '.

813
01:27:59,650 --> 01:28:01,530
It was not smart.

814
01:28:01,610 --> 01:28:05,030
told him/her to keep him/it ' cotillon ' in the case of lho to ask.

815
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:09,410
Poor girl, didn't tell me anything.

816
01:28:09,490 --> 01:28:12,450
- Of course will make him/it, if it wants. - If I want?

817
01:28:12,540 --> 01:28:15,120
Oh, will it dance with her because I want?

818
01:28:15,210 --> 01:28:17,500
Fear to upset her.

819
01:28:18,540 --> 01:28:21,960
it seems to have many young in the card.

820
01:28:24,170 --> 01:28:28,050
- it lets to see me if I understand. - Does it understand each other the something?

821
01:28:29,260 --> 01:28:32,020
told me that it wanted to marry with my stepdaughter.

822
01:28:32,020 --> 01:28:37,600
- Didn't it forget? - I wrote to Mr. Osmond this morning.

823
01:28:37,690 --> 01:28:40,770
it didn't say to have received his/her letter.

824
01:28:40,860 --> 01:28:43,360
It is a letter difficult to write.

825
01:28:45,450 --> 01:28:47,910
Don't forget sending.

826
01:29:23,860 --> 01:29:25,820
Don't dance?

827
01:29:25,900 --> 01:29:28,820
No, if it doesn't go with her.

828
01:29:30,910 --> 01:29:35,040
- it should leave although, then. - Only when she goes.

829
01:29:43,300 --> 01:29:47,880
Who is his/her unhappy friend? it was with funeral face.

830
01:29:47,970 --> 01:29:52,050
it is right for such. My husband doesn't give him/her ears.

831
01:29:52,050 --> 01:29:56,390
it seems to be a different youth.

832
01:29:56,480 --> 01:30:00,060
kindness yours, even to a rival.

833
01:30:00,190 --> 01:30:01,730
A rival?

834
01:30:06,150 --> 01:30:07,530
Don't tell me that she likes him?

835
01:30:10,990 --> 01:30:14,830
Yes, I think it likes.

836
01:30:15,330 --> 01:30:18,080
told me that his/her desire it would be it of his/her father,

837
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:19,830
and that he prefers me.

838
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:23,250
it said that she had an enormous one I want of pleasing the father.

839
01:30:25,090 --> 01:30:30,090
- It seems a lot of correcto. - A lot of correcto...

840
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:37,520
but never a feeling

841
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:41,270
the one that a man wants to owe a wife's obtaining.

842
01:30:45,020 --> 01:30:50,240
Because it is so contradictory, so skeptic?

843
01:31:08,050 --> 01:31:10,840
- It dances divinamente. - Thank you.

844
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:53,800
would like to put a subject.

845
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:57,680
It is on the Lorde Warburton.

846
01:32:02,390 --> 01:32:08,150
Is he even in love?

847
01:32:13,150 --> 01:32:16,870
Yes, I believe that it is him really. It is noticed.

848
01:32:18,910 --> 01:32:21,290
seem disappointed.

849
01:32:24,210 --> 01:32:30,500
No, just mistaken.

850
01:32:33,220 --> 01:32:36,340
judged that it had understood that he doesn't love Pansy.

851
01:32:36,430 --> 01:32:41,350
- Pansy, not. - But have just said that yes.

852
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:43,770
it said that he loves you.

853
01:32:47,230 --> 01:32:51,360
- That is a foolishness. - To me, it denied him/it.

854
01:33:03,660 --> 01:33:05,870
You don't help me.

855
01:33:12,340 --> 01:33:15,130
You should be so unhappy.

856
01:33:28,150 --> 01:33:33,400
When I say help, I say a foolishness.

857
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:36,900
Only the idea of inconveniencing you with my domestic embarrassments...

858
01:33:39,570 --> 01:33:43,080
Your husband will find that you didn't insist enough.

859
01:33:44,700 --> 01:33:46,620
A subject that badly can discuss,

860
01:33:46,620 --> 01:33:50,380
because all the interest is of his/her part.

861
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:54,840
Do you know him/it what that will do him to say?

862
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:58,550
That your negligence if it owes to the jealousy.

863
01:33:58,630 --> 01:34:02,470
- To the jealousy? - Of his/her daughter.

864
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:09,140
- You are not kind. - You are frank with me and you will see.

865
01:35:03,660 --> 01:35:05,580
If it knows what you intend,

866
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:10,620
what wants...

867
01:35:13,290 --> 01:35:16,880
can act in conformity.

868
01:35:18,840 --> 01:35:23,550
The only thing that I intend in the life it is to marry with Mr. Rosier.

869
01:35:25,930 --> 01:35:29,980
Your father would like you to do a better marriage.

870
01:35:34,150 --> 01:35:38,280
- What does want me to do? - The Lorde Warburton...

871
01:35:40,530 --> 01:35:43,030
it has really been showing kind.

872
01:35:43,030 --> 01:35:49,240
It is wanted to say that he will ask my hand, I think it makes a mistake.

873
01:35:53,170 --> 01:35:55,420
Your father would have in that the largest taste.

874
01:35:55,460 --> 01:35:59,250
The Lorde Warburton won't ask my hand to please to the Papá.

875
01:35:59,340 --> 01:36:03,760
There is no danger. There is no danger.

876
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:08,510
It is as if he had me statement, ' I like you a lot,

877
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:12,430
' but if it doesn't please you, I will never repeat him/it. '

878
01:36:14,020 --> 01:36:17,770
And plus, he doesn't also love me.

879
01:36:18,650 --> 01:36:24,530
- Not. There is no danger. - You should say that to your father.

880
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:28,780
preferred him/it not to do.

881
01:36:30,620 --> 01:36:34,160
Would not you let to have him/it vain hopes?

882
01:36:36,210 --> 01:36:39,420
For me, it was better than had them.

883
01:36:40,380 --> 01:36:42,920
Like this, it would not propose more nobody,

884
01:36:44,340 --> 01:36:48,220
and that would be a great advantage for me.

885
01:36:52,890 --> 01:36:54,810
Rosier.

886
01:37:02,860 --> 01:37:07,070
it will have Warburton so much difficulty in forming their words?

887
01:37:10,660 --> 01:37:14,710
When it told you that it would write, what did answer him/her?

888
01:37:17,170 --> 01:37:18,960
That if it didn't forget.

889
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:23,550
seemingly, it forgot. it has the kindness of reminding him/it.

890
01:37:23,630 --> 01:37:27,130
If you want to lie down the hand to Warburton, it lies down her you.

891
01:37:27,130 --> 01:37:29,430
It is not easy. You are against me.

892
01:37:29,430 --> 01:37:33,720
- it told you that it would make the possible. - That made to win you time.

893
01:37:35,730 --> 01:37:38,770
My husband and I spoke about itself.

894
01:37:39,650 --> 01:37:43,690
asked where it would be. We judged that if it had been absent.

895
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:47,650
I am to leave.

896
01:37:47,740 --> 01:37:50,780
I am forced England to return.

897
01:37:50,870 --> 01:37:53,540
lament to leave the poor Touchett.

898
01:37:53,620 --> 01:37:55,910
Light the poor Touchett get.

899
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,960
it should await the hottest time.

900
01:37:58,040 --> 01:38:01,540
it would not advise him/it to travel now.

901
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:07,380
I have a letter to write before dinner. Does it give me license?

902
01:38:07,380 --> 01:38:11,510
When it is in Rome, come to do us a visit.

903
01:38:23,270 --> 01:38:26,110
Fortunately it is the last time.

904
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:32,320
Also me. She doesn't like me.

905
01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:54,050
- Good night, Papá. - Good night. it sleeps well.

906
01:38:58,890 --> 01:39:02,190
You still don't go. I want to speak with you.

907
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:31,800
I don't understand what intend.

908
01:39:31,880 --> 01:39:34,720
intend to lie down, I am tired.

909
01:39:42,730 --> 01:39:46,150
I think you are me to try to humiliate.

910
01:39:46,230 --> 01:39:50,650
You are to do a complicated game. You controlled him/it very well.

911
01:39:53,240 --> 01:39:54,660
What did control me?

912
01:39:54,660 --> 01:39:58,160
always had this case in the hand.

913
01:39:58,620 --> 01:40:02,960
will mean me without circumlocutions that you accuse me?

914
01:40:05,750 --> 01:40:09,250
Of having impeded the marriage of Pansy with Warburton.

915
01:40:09,380 --> 01:40:14,220
- Was it without circumlocutions? - I made an effort for turning the reality.

916
01:40:15,220 --> 01:40:17,930
wanted my support, and I agreed.

917
01:40:17,930 --> 01:40:22,140
- I went a fool, but I made him/it. - You faked that you made him/it.

918
01:40:22,230 --> 01:40:25,060
The letter that you said what did he have writing?

919
01:40:26,730 --> 01:40:31,530
- I don't make idea.
- You destroyed her.

920
01:40:36,450 --> 01:40:41,370
- For somebody that was so noble... - I never went as noble as you.

921
01:40:41,450 --> 01:40:43,580
had everything that you intended.

922
01:40:43,660 --> 01:40:46,420
removed him/it discreetly of the road,

923
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:50,460
and to me you put me in the position in that you see me,

924
01:40:50,460 --> 01:40:55,470
a man that tried to marry the daughter with a lord, and it failed.

925
01:40:55,470 --> 01:40:58,760
- Pansy doesn't like him. - It doesn't interest!

926
01:40:58,850 --> 01:41:02,980
- And he doesn't like... - You told me that it liked!

927
01:41:03,060 --> 01:41:06,900
from now on,you will be you to treat her of these subjects.

928
01:41:22,120 --> 01:41:24,830
I always judged that you esteemed my daughter.

929
01:41:25,460 --> 01:41:28,540
Never as much as now.

930
01:41:28,580 --> 01:41:30,630
Your esteem has enormous limitations.

931
01:41:30,630 --> 01:41:33,210
however, that maybe is natural.

932
01:41:34,210 --> 01:41:38,640
- Is everything it what wanted me to say? - Are you satisfied?

933
01:41:42,010 --> 01:41:45,230
find me sufficiently disappointed?

934
01:41:45,230 --> 01:41:48,940
I think you are not disappointed of completely.

935
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:53,480
had another opportunity of doing me of stupid.

936
01:42:04,620 --> 01:42:06,290
It is not that...

937
01:42:07,790 --> 01:42:10,540
Pansy has a good future for the front.

938
01:43:00,970 --> 01:43:04,560
it knows that cannot return for alone England.

939
01:43:06,220 --> 01:43:10,060
it didn't intend to do him/it. I take people with me.

940
01:43:10,140 --> 01:43:14,310
people as? Servants pagos for itself?

941
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:19,990
after all, they are human beings.

942
01:43:20,990 --> 01:43:25,990
- I think I will go with itself. - Will it go with me?

943
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:30,160
I know that it doesn't have me esteem, but I will go with itself.

944
01:43:30,790 --> 01:43:34,290
And plus, I will take care of itself.

945
01:43:36,710 --> 01:43:38,760
have him/her a lot of esteem.

946
01:43:39,260 --> 01:43:41,510
Don't judge that can buy me.

947
01:43:41,590 --> 01:43:44,140
Fear to serve as wood-of-hair.

948
01:43:44,220 --> 01:43:47,640
Mrs. Osmond wants him to travel with itself.

949
01:43:49,140 --> 01:43:52,190
But that is not the main.

950
01:43:52,270 --> 01:43:55,810
The main is that she wants that I leave Rome.

951
01:43:56,730 --> 01:43:58,860
it wants that all of us leave Rome.

952
01:44:16,710 --> 01:44:18,710
It is very kind of his/her part.

953
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:21,840
Nor I tell him/her how kind I find him/it.

954
01:44:23,220 --> 01:44:25,890
And is it like this that it orders me away?

955
01:44:25,970 --> 01:44:29,060
- it has to return one day of these. - I don't like his/her cousin.

956
01:44:29,140 --> 01:44:31,310
Is it that what wants me to say?

957
01:44:31,390 --> 01:44:34,980
I don't want to tell him/her thing none.

958
01:44:36,690 --> 01:44:39,150
I cannot understand. In what have-of believing?

959
01:44:39,230 --> 01:44:41,820
What does want me to think?

960
01:44:41,900 --> 01:44:44,110
would like to know if it is happy.

961
01:44:44,200 --> 01:44:45,660
For me would be something.

962
01:44:45,740 --> 01:44:49,830
it says that it is happy, though...

963
01:44:49,910 --> 01:44:53,960
it is so static, so polished, so... rigid.

964
01:44:56,380 --> 01:45:00,340
it is very changed. Everything hides.

965
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:04,420
- I didn't approach itself. - it approached a lot.

966
01:45:21,900 --> 01:45:25,240
seem very happy for you see yourself free from us.

967
01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:31,700
My dear Ralph!

968
01:45:35,080 --> 01:45:37,580
Little time passed with you,

969
01:45:37,670 --> 01:45:39,710
but it was better than none.

970
01:45:41,750 --> 01:45:44,260
I heard your respect a lot.

971
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:48,640
I don't know for who, living the life that you take.

972
01:45:49,800 --> 01:45:51,970
They were the voices that the wind takes.

973
01:46:00,270 --> 01:46:02,820
You have been my best friend.

974
01:46:06,900 --> 01:46:11,990
It was for you that I wanted to live, but of anything I serve you.

975
01:46:24,630 --> 01:46:29,720
If you sent for me, I came.

976
01:46:30,970 --> 01:46:35,390
- Your husband would never consent him/it. - It would not like,

977
01:46:35,470 --> 01:46:38,140
but I maybe came, even so.

978
01:46:43,650 --> 01:46:48,450
hoped here to see the Lorde Warburton, and to congratulate Pansy.

979
01:46:48,530 --> 01:46:50,160
it should not have gone to Naples.

980
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:52,240
it should have been for the outcome.

981
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:53,780
Does it think it is too late?

982
01:46:53,910 --> 01:46:58,370
finished. Give him/her rest...

983
01:46:58,460 --> 01:47:01,540
Osmond certainly will like of talking with itself on that.

984
01:47:01,630 --> 01:47:06,000
I already know what he thinks, it came yesterday to visit me.

985
01:47:08,630 --> 01:47:10,550
Badly it did arrive?

986
01:47:13,050 --> 01:47:16,010
His/her husband censures her severely.

987
01:47:20,310 --> 01:47:22,980
wait. Please.

988
01:47:37,700 --> 01:47:41,330
If possible, I want to know the truth.

989
01:47:44,130 --> 01:47:46,880
What truth does the one refer?

990
01:47:48,130 --> 01:47:49,970
Just to this...

991
01:47:52,010 --> 01:47:55,430
The Lorde Warburton changed of ideas

992
01:47:55,510 --> 01:47:59,600
of his/her own motorcycle, or because lho recommended?

993
01:48:01,060 --> 01:48:04,520
For pleasure of him, or for yours?

994
01:48:04,610 --> 01:48:08,900
Be reasonable. Don't be offended.

995
01:48:14,160 --> 01:48:17,160
If the Lorde Warburton it got tired of the poor child,

996
01:48:17,160 --> 01:48:20,160
that is a thing, and it is a feather.

997
01:48:21,080 --> 01:48:26,420
But if he gave up of her to please him/her, that is already other.

998
01:48:28,250 --> 01:48:33,180
If it goes that the case, free him/it. Leave him/it for us.

999
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:40,680
- Who are you? - it reacts like this!

1000
01:48:40,770 --> 01:48:43,270
What does have to do with my life?

1001
01:48:47,860 --> 01:48:49,980
Everything.

1002
01:48:57,740 --> 01:49:00,540
it would give my right hand to cry.

1003
01:49:00,620 --> 01:49:03,210
What could that make well?

1004
01:49:05,250 --> 01:49:07,380
Faria to feel...

1005
01:49:08,840 --> 01:49:11,130
as it felt before knowing you.

1006
01:49:16,300 --> 01:49:18,680
If I made to dry off the tears, it is good, but...

1007
01:49:18,760 --> 01:49:19,850
I already saw to flow you them.

1008
01:49:19,850 --> 01:49:24,690
I believe that you will make to regret me, and to howl as a wolf.

1009
01:49:25,480 --> 01:49:27,690
I deserve that.

1010
01:49:27,770 --> 01:49:31,480
This late was vile. I was horrible.

1011
01:49:33,150 --> 01:49:36,280
It can be that have statement things of bad taste.

1012
01:49:36,360 --> 01:49:39,370
it was full of something bad,

1013
01:49:41,740 --> 01:49:45,870
or something good. I don't know, it was stronger than I.

1014
01:49:50,290 --> 01:49:54,670
You didn't dry me only the tears, you dried me the soul.

1015
01:49:54,760 --> 01:49:56,970
You are very wicked.

1016
01:50:08,850 --> 01:50:11,190
Is it like this that will end?

1017
01:50:14,190 --> 01:50:16,780
As they finish the wicked people...

1018
01:50:18,740 --> 01:50:21,660
as for the crimes that shared?

1019
01:50:24,500 --> 01:50:27,290
did me as bad as you.

1020
01:50:28,120 --> 01:50:30,960
To me you seem me good.

1021
01:50:39,470 --> 01:50:42,350
My God!

1022
01:50:46,730 --> 01:50:50,190
After all you will cry. Some time I complained?

1023
01:50:50,190 --> 01:50:54,860
Of course didn't complain. You enjoy too much your victory.

1024
01:50:55,690 --> 01:50:58,400
made your wife to fear you.

1025
01:51:00,280 --> 01:51:03,660
This late feared me, but it belonged to you that it was afraid.

1026
01:51:03,700 --> 01:51:05,740
I didn't go me that had this idea.

1027
01:51:05,740 --> 01:51:08,910
Your mill unchained her.

1028
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,630
I only ask that my wife is considered.

1029
01:51:11,710 --> 01:51:14,880
would owe her to be considered so much?

1030
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:18,920
If you do a tragedy of that, the tragedy won't be for her.

1031
01:51:20,380 --> 01:51:22,180
It will be for me.

1032
01:51:24,180 --> 01:51:27,680
will suffer the consequences, and you will make the same.

1033
01:51:30,850 --> 01:51:33,520
caution with that valuable objecto.

1034
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:36,610
it already has a lower case splits.

1035
01:51:45,240 --> 01:51:49,330
As my wife doesn't esteem me,

1036
01:51:49,410 --> 01:51:52,580
will look for comfort near Pansy.

1037
01:51:54,420 --> 01:51:57,550
happily,I don't find him/her a single defect.

1038
01:52:05,640 --> 01:52:08,520
it hears what tell you! it leaves me!

1039
01:52:30,250 --> 01:52:32,500
Mrs. Osmond? Mrs. Osmond!

1040
01:52:35,750 --> 01:52:39,710
I was in Paris! I sold my colecção!

1041
01:52:39,800 --> 01:52:42,630
The profit was magnificent: 50.000 dollars!

1042
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:47,100
It will be that Mr. Osmond does it find me sufficiently rich?

1043
01:52:53,640 --> 01:52:56,480
Pee, eats the food.

1044
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:59,230
Beautiful Pee!

1045
01:53:19,460 --> 01:53:21,380
Pansy is not well?

1046
01:53:24,630 --> 01:53:29,140
it is very well. I ordered her/it to the convent.

1047
01:53:29,220 --> 01:53:33,140
I didn't tell you because I doubt that it manages to do to understand each other.

1048
01:53:34,140 --> 01:53:36,730
Our daughter is wanted breeze and beautiful woman.

1049
01:53:36,810 --> 01:53:40,320
Pansy it is a little withers and shaky.

1050
01:53:43,030 --> 01:53:46,910
it will have time for reflectir. I want that her reflicta in a thing.

1051
01:53:46,990 --> 01:53:49,660
Everything is very absurd, dear Osmond.

1052
01:53:49,740 --> 01:53:53,080
Because you don't say what do want moved away her/it of me?

1053
01:53:55,290 --> 01:53:59,460
If that was the case, it would be simpler to banish you.

1054
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:02,670
You know that I have in a lot of bill Mr. Rosier.

1055
01:54:02,750 --> 01:54:06,930
In a lot of bill even. I think simpaticíssimo.

1056
01:54:08,010 --> 01:54:11,640
it made me to believe in the absolute love.

1057
01:54:46,590 --> 01:54:47,720
excuse...

1058
01:54:47,720 --> 01:54:50,720
When I am going to your room, I always beat.

1059
01:54:50,720 --> 01:54:52,850
forgot.

1060
01:54:53,720 --> 01:54:55,970
I have more in than to think.

1061
01:54:57,600 --> 01:55:01,520
- My cousin is to die. - I don't believe.

1062
01:55:01,610 --> 01:55:04,690
it was to die when casámos. It will bury us to all.

1063
01:55:04,780 --> 01:55:10,240
My aunt sent me a telegram. I have to leave for England.

1064
01:55:12,240 --> 01:55:13,950
I don't see the need.

1065
01:55:14,030 --> 01:55:17,120
I have that seeing before dying.

1066
01:55:18,370 --> 01:55:21,210
It doesn't please me that you go.

1067
01:55:21,290 --> 01:55:23,460
It doesn't please you that I don't go.

1068
01:55:25,460 --> 01:55:28,170
Anything than I do you pleases.

1069
01:55:30,090 --> 01:55:32,470
You fake to think that I lie.

1070
01:55:36,930 --> 01:55:39,180
Is it for that reason that you go?

1071
01:55:39,180 --> 01:55:43,610
Not to see your cousin, but for you avenge yourself of me?

1072
01:55:45,400 --> 01:55:49,240
want intensely that I commit a foolishness.

1073
01:55:54,660 --> 01:55:56,950
If you leave today, it will be an acto

1074
01:55:56,950 --> 01:56:02,790
deliberate and calculated opposition.

1075
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:06,710
Nor you know how unjust you seem me.

1076
01:56:08,210 --> 01:56:11,300
It is your opposition that is made calculations.

1077
01:56:12,890 --> 01:56:15,050
It is evil.

1078
01:56:27,360 --> 01:56:31,740
My ideal defines him/it that the my wife owes or she should not do.

1079
01:56:31,740 --> 01:56:36,490
it should not cross Europe for to sit down in the other men's bed.

1080
01:56:36,490 --> 01:56:41,040
Your cousin doesn't mean anything. Nor for you, nor for us.

1081
01:56:41,120 --> 01:56:45,500
You make an expressive smile when I speak about us,

1082
01:56:45,580 --> 01:56:48,300
but I assure you that us...

1083
01:56:48,380 --> 01:56:51,170
us, Mrs. Osmond...

1084
01:56:53,720 --> 01:56:55,510
everything is that counts.

1085
01:56:59,810 --> 01:57:04,020
You are closer of me that any other human creature,

1086
01:57:04,020 --> 01:57:06,360
as well as me I am of you.

1087
01:57:06,360 --> 01:57:08,730
It will be an undesirable proximity,

1088
01:57:08,820 --> 01:57:13,280
but it is fruit of our creation.

1089
01:57:13,360 --> 01:57:17,620
You don't like that me to reminds,

1090
01:57:18,530 --> 01:57:20,580
but I make him/it willingly,

1091
01:57:22,790 --> 01:57:27,710
because I have faith that should accept the consequences of our acções,

1092
01:57:29,670 --> 01:57:34,050
and that that more values in the life it is the honor of the thing in itself.

1093
01:58:21,510 --> 01:58:25,180
it tells me a funny book to read.

1094
01:58:25,270 --> 01:58:27,600
Will this here be good?

1095
01:58:28,600 --> 01:58:31,270
My cousin Ralph is to die.

1096
01:58:33,650 --> 01:58:38,070
It was so nice. Lament a lot.

1097
01:58:41,990 --> 01:58:42,870
It is with bad to seem.

1098
01:58:42,870 --> 01:58:46,830
Osmond said that there cannot go.

1099
01:58:46,910 --> 01:58:50,210
And because that Osmond said?

1100
01:58:50,290 --> 01:58:54,920
Because we are so happy the two that cannot separate.

1101
01:59:24,200 --> 01:59:26,500
it is very unhappy.

1102
01:59:28,910 --> 01:59:34,380
I am, but I don't find that can comfort myself.

1103
01:59:36,170 --> 01:59:38,840
Does it give me license that tries?

1104
01:59:38,920 --> 01:59:42,430
I want him to know a thing...

1105
01:59:43,470 --> 01:59:47,270
Maybe already it knows, or have guessed.

1106
01:59:48,890 --> 01:59:52,310
In his/her place, it had already guessed.

1107
01:59:52,400 --> 01:59:55,320
Did it never suspect, at least?

1108
01:59:58,740 --> 02:00:00,860
did suspect of something?

1109
02:00:00,950 --> 02:00:04,160
My first sister-in-law it didn't have children.

1110
02:00:07,450 --> 02:00:09,660
Still nor it had done three years married,

1111
02:00:09,660 --> 02:00:12,540
and it died without leaving children.

1112
02:00:15,090 --> 02:00:17,500
Pansy is not daughter of my husband?

1113
02:00:17,500 --> 02:00:22,220
Of his/her husband in the perfection, but of his/her wife, not.

1114
02:00:22,970 --> 02:00:27,600
My dear Isabel! I get, there is to put the points in the ii.

1115
02:00:28,430 --> 02:00:29,520
Of who it is?

1116
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:33,770
She has been very smart, formidable in relation to Pansy.

1117
02:00:40,570 --> 02:00:42,910
it never happened him/her

1118
02:00:42,990 --> 02:00:47,330
what Calm Merle lover of him was during six or seven years?

1119
02:00:52,370 --> 02:00:54,960
finally understand.

1120
02:01:36,500 --> 02:01:39,880
surprise him/her that I here am,

1121
02:01:39,960 --> 02:01:42,460
and fear that doesn't please him/her.

1122
02:01:47,800 --> 02:01:51,350
it should have asked him/her for permission.

1123
02:01:55,190 --> 02:01:57,190
I came to see Pansy.

1124
02:01:58,940 --> 02:02:02,940
I remembered that it would be very only.

1125
02:02:13,830 --> 02:02:16,120
That that is a little sad.

1126
02:02:20,170 --> 02:02:22,250
For that I came, to the...

1127
02:03:15,970 --> 02:03:17,680
Doesn't it think it was more beautiful?

1128
02:03:17,770 --> 02:03:21,650
Yes. it seems comfortable.

1129
02:03:25,030 --> 02:03:29,070
I came to say good-bye. I am going to England.

1130
02:03:35,080 --> 02:03:37,330
For not returning?

1131
02:03:39,410 --> 02:03:41,670
My cousin is very sick.

1132
02:03:45,840 --> 02:03:50,260
- Don't leave me here. - Do you want to come now with me?

1133
02:03:50,260 --> 02:03:55,720
- Did the Papá tell him/her that it asked?
- Not. It was my idea.

1134
02:04:00,770 --> 02:04:03,020
Then it is better I to wait.

1135
02:04:04,440 --> 02:04:08,490
He judges that I still didn't gorge, but I already gorged.

1136
02:04:08,570 --> 02:04:13,240
it wanted me to meditate a little, and I meditated enough.

1137
02:04:13,320 --> 02:04:17,870
- What conclusion did the one arrive? - I should not never displease to the Papá.

1138
02:04:27,750 --> 02:04:33,470
decided to wait for itself, but it is not to speak of Pansy.

1139
02:04:33,550 --> 02:04:36,640
- Does it have a lot of esteem for his/her cousin? - I don't understand you.

1140
02:04:41,520 --> 02:04:43,190
His/her cousin did him/her once a great favor.

1141
02:04:43,190 --> 02:04:48,480
Did it never guess him/it? it turned her rich.

1142
02:04:51,240 --> 02:04:52,530
did turn?

1143
02:04:52,610 --> 02:04:56,660
The money belonged to his/her uncle, but the idea belonged to his/her cousin.

1144
02:04:56,740 --> 02:04:58,740
convinced the father to accept her.

1145
02:04:58,740 --> 02:05:03,750
I don't know because it tells me this. I don't know how it can know.

1146
02:05:03,750 --> 02:05:09,590
I don't know except that that I guessed, and I guessed this.

1147
02:05:10,420 --> 02:05:13,180
In the bottom, it should thank him/her.

1148
02:05:13,260 --> 02:05:16,260
judged that should thank itself.

1149
02:05:20,060 --> 02:05:24,770
I know that it is very unhappy, but I am more.

1150
02:06:16,110 --> 02:06:19,070
It is not wonderful what has come?

1151
02:06:20,700 --> 02:06:23,620
- What such the crossing was? - Very good.

1152
02:06:25,460 --> 02:06:30,130
No! No, I think it was stormy.

1153
02:07:20,390 --> 02:07:25,180
Does he get to see me? Does it get to speak?

1154
02:07:25,270 --> 02:07:28,850
- You can try. - No there is any hope?

1155
02:07:28,850 --> 02:07:32,520
absolutely none. There was never.

1156
02:09:04,410 --> 02:09:07,120
It is your a lot of kindness have come.

1157
02:09:09,500 --> 02:09:12,210
I thought you would come, but it was not the sure.

1158
02:09:12,250 --> 02:09:16,670
I didn't also have, until coming.

1159
02:09:21,670 --> 02:09:24,220
For me everything ended.

1160
02:09:33,310 --> 02:09:36,360
Let's hope it also had finishing for you.

1161
02:09:41,490 --> 02:09:44,660
What did make for me when leaving Rome?

1162
02:09:46,820 --> 02:09:49,410
And that you did you for me?

1163
02:09:51,410 --> 02:09:54,040
In times, you made a thing.

1164
02:09:54,960 --> 02:09:57,130
You know well.

1165
02:10:05,550 --> 02:10:07,390
keep me in the heart.

1166
02:10:07,470 --> 02:10:11,390
will be more close to you of the one that never.

1167
02:10:13,680 --> 02:10:16,690
I never thanked you.

1168
02:10:16,770 --> 02:10:22,940
Me... I never spoke. I was never what should be.

1169
02:10:24,610 --> 02:10:25,820
But as it had to know?

1170
02:10:25,820 --> 02:10:30,620
I only now know, because there are people less stupid than I.

1171
02:10:30,740 --> 02:10:32,620
it lets to be the people.

1172
02:10:38,670 --> 02:10:42,750
- Is it true? - What did go stupid?

1173
02:10:44,720 --> 02:10:50,010
- Not. - He married with me for money.

1174
02:10:55,890 --> 02:10:58,980
I only want you to understand.

1175
02:10:59,060 --> 02:11:02,440
I always tried to impede you that you understood.

1176
02:11:04,190 --> 02:11:06,490
But all this ended.

1177
02:11:10,570 --> 02:11:12,370
Did he hinder your arrival a lot?

1178
02:11:12,370 --> 02:11:17,210
Everything turned very complicated, but I don't care.

1179
02:11:17,870 --> 02:11:21,840
Here, with you...

1180
02:11:23,880 --> 02:11:27,470
I am happy, as it was not there is a long time.

1181
02:11:29,800 --> 02:11:33,260
I want you to be happy.

1182
02:11:33,350 --> 02:11:36,020
That you feel close to you.

1183
02:11:38,810 --> 02:11:41,100
That you know that I love you.

1184
02:11:44,230 --> 02:11:47,320
Because it has there to be pain?

1185
02:11:47,400 --> 02:11:49,780
It is not what there is of deeper.

1186
02:12:02,540 --> 02:12:04,750
You have to be here.

1187
02:12:10,630 --> 02:12:15,350
The pain is deep, but it passes.

1188
02:12:15,430 --> 02:12:20,060
In fact, it is to pass now. But the love lasts long.

1189
02:12:25,650 --> 02:12:29,280
I don't know because we must suffer so much. Maybe come to discover.

1190
02:12:37,620 --> 02:12:39,660
I don't have faith...

1191
02:12:43,290 --> 02:12:47,130
I don't have faith that a mistake as generous as this

1192
02:12:47,210 --> 02:12:49,590
it can hurt you like this so much.

1193
02:12:51,800 --> 02:12:54,140
And it reminds you of this...

1194
02:12:54,220 --> 02:12:58,680
If you were hated, you were also loved.

1195
02:13:01,690 --> 02:13:03,600
Oh, Isabel...

1196
02:13:07,320 --> 02:13:09,570
adored.

1197
02:14:25,600 --> 02:14:29,940
The man, born of the woman, it is of few days

1198
02:14:30,020 --> 02:14:31,940
and full of inquietude.

1199
02:14:32,030 --> 02:14:35,030
it is born as the flower, and it withers.

1200
02:14:35,150 --> 02:14:39,740
it also flees as the shadow and it doesn't stay.

1201
02:14:40,740 --> 02:14:44,000
On that such one you open your eyes,

1202
02:14:44,120 --> 02:14:48,000
and to me you do me to enter in judgement with you?

1203
02:14:48,130 --> 02:14:50,290
Who of the filthy will remove the pure?

1204
02:15:12,070 --> 02:15:14,320
adore him.

1205
02:15:26,040 --> 02:15:28,960
adore him.

1206
02:15:34,170 --> 02:15:36,260
scared me.

1207
02:15:42,220 --> 02:15:44,430
it wanted to see her/it the alone ones.

1208
02:15:44,520 --> 02:15:49,390
Therefore I was to the wait, and to walk thereabout.

1209
02:15:54,610 --> 02:15:58,030
I don't want to inconvenience her, as I did in Rome.

1210
02:15:58,110 --> 02:16:01,070
it didn't serve as anything, it only disturbed her.

1211
02:16:01,160 --> 02:16:05,870
I knew that it was wrong. But now I know that I am not.

1212
02:16:05,870 --> 02:16:09,290
Now everything changed. I can help her.

1213
02:16:09,370 --> 02:16:12,210
How can I help myself?

1214
02:16:14,710 --> 02:16:17,380
It was good to have made me to come away with his/her cousin.

1215
02:16:17,460 --> 02:16:20,800
it was a good man. A noble man.

1216
02:16:22,590 --> 02:16:26,810
spoke to me about his/her case. Everything explained his/her respect.

1217
02:16:28,600 --> 02:16:30,480
guessed my feelings.

1218
02:16:38,740 --> 02:16:42,610
it knows what he told me right here, of the last time that saw him/it?

1219
02:16:42,740 --> 02:16:46,490
it said, it does for her everything that you can.

1220
02:16:47,950 --> 02:16:50,040
' Everything that she to let to do you. '

1221
02:16:51,960 --> 02:16:54,630
it didn't have anything to speak of me.

1222
02:16:56,130 --> 02:16:59,590
Because no, if only falámos for well? He was to die.

1223
02:17:06,390 --> 02:17:10,270
It is too late to act.

1224
02:17:11,100 --> 02:17:13,900
Touchett knew, and me also, the one that cost come him here.

1225
02:17:13,900 --> 02:17:17,900
will have cost him/her his/her life.

1226
02:17:17,980 --> 02:17:22,700
it is afraid of returning.

1227
02:17:26,410 --> 02:17:31,370
it is completely only. Now think about me.

1228
02:17:33,710 --> 02:17:37,130
- In itself. - Come to me.

1229
02:17:37,210 --> 02:17:41,260
Because have-of returning? Because have-of facing all that?

1230
02:17:41,260 --> 02:17:44,640
- To move away me of itself. - I want to impede that.

1231
02:17:51,310 --> 02:17:57,230
If at least it listened to me once. Because we must be happy?

1232
02:17:57,270 --> 02:18:02,990
because, when is it here before us? When is it so easy?

1233
02:18:03,070 --> 02:18:05,200
can do what to please us.

1234
02:18:05,200 --> 02:18:09,370
To who we do have us of rendering bills?

1235
02:18:10,990 --> 02:18:13,410
beg him/her that it leaves.

1236
02:18:15,710 --> 02:18:18,790
Don't say that. Don't kill me.

1237
02:23:49,790 --> 02:23:49,880
END
