1
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:24,854
Reporter: I hear there's a lot
of dead bodies and zero leads.

2
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,856
We're still processing
the crime scene.

3
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:29,225
When we have that information,
I'll let you know.

4
00:03:29,325 --> 00:03:32,295
- (Reporters clamoring)
- How many victims? Do you have any leads?

5
00:03:32,395 --> 00:03:34,564
Slow down, slow down.

6
00:03:34,664 --> 00:03:36,904
We're getting reports that
there are multiple survivors.

7
00:03:36,899 --> 00:03:40,303
- Can you confirm that?
- (Clamoring continues)

8
00:03:40,403 --> 00:03:42,705
We'll be releasing
those details when we're ready.

9
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:46,776
Is it true you discovered cameras
at the scene of the crime?

10
00:03:46,876 --> 00:03:48,716
As soon as we have answers,
I'll let you know.

11
00:03:48,711 --> 00:03:50,280
Next question.

12
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:54,184
(All talking
at once)

13
00:03:54,284 --> 00:03:56,252
...can you explain that?

14
00:03:56,352 --> 00:03:57,554
As you know,

15
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,455
from the record
of this department,

16
00:03:59,555 --> 00:04:01,524
we will not stop
until justice is served.

17
00:04:01,624 --> 00:04:04,194
That's all
we have time for.

18
00:04:04,294 --> 00:04:08,198
- (Clamoring continues)
- We'll release more information later.

19
00:04:08,298 --> 00:04:10,466
When we know more,
you'll know more. Thank you.

20
00:04:10,566 --> 00:04:12,635
Man: That's all for now,
folks, thanks for coming.

21
00:04:12,735 --> 00:04:16,739
There'll be another press conference later.
Thank you very much.

22
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,909
I wanna watch these videos.
What have we got on those bodies?

23
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:22,729
- Explosion corrupted half the forensics.
- Okay, what about I.D.'S?

24
00:04:22,445 --> 00:04:24,681
Can't tell if the ones we do
have are male or female.

25
00:04:24,781 --> 00:04:26,632
- Well, figure it out.
- Yes, ma'am.

26
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,069
Jesus.

27
00:04:32,455 --> 00:04:35,992
- Go home, Reese. You're on leave.
- I want on the case.

28
00:04:36,092 --> 00:04:38,728
I have enough on my plate.
I can't deal with your baggage.

29
00:04:38,828 --> 00:04:40,630
Baggage. Is that
what you're calling it?

30
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,465
- I can help.
- We're doing fine.

31
00:04:42,565 --> 00:04:44,634
- Yeah, 'cause Gabe called--
- you're not ready.

32
00:04:44,734 --> 00:04:45,935
I spent three years
in the v.U.

33
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:47,670
I practically
wrote the manual.

34
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:50,306
You're not ready.

35
00:04:50,406 --> 00:04:53,458
You need me.
You know what I can do.

36
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:00,465
Alex...

37
00:05:01,984 --> 00:05:04,369
I need this.

38
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,564
Cavalry's arrived.

39
00:05:14,664 --> 00:05:16,733
What's the eta
on the capture?

40
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:19,836
Reese, thought I was gonna
have to do this one on my own.

41
00:05:19,936 --> 00:05:22,438
I got your back.
Where we at with the video?

42
00:05:22,538 --> 00:05:24,007
Capture complete
in five minutes.

43
00:05:24,107 --> 00:05:26,376
- How many hours are there?
- About three.

44
00:05:26,476 --> 00:05:27,910
Formats?

45
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,445
Four cameras,

46
00:05:29,545 --> 00:05:31,314
but the fire damage
is glitching the video.

47
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,882
I think it's
slowing down the capture.

48
00:05:32,982 --> 00:05:34,884
Next time, copy it
to the hard drive

49
00:05:34,984 --> 00:05:36,719
before the server,
it's faster.

50
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:38,488
Right. Yeah. Yes, sir.

51
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,523
Update on
our survivor?

52
00:05:40,623 --> 00:05:42,959
Still unresponsive.
Third-degree burns,

53
00:05:43,059 --> 00:05:45,859
massive lacerations to the head and neck.
I got a uniform standing by.

54
00:05:45,895 --> 00:05:48,335
- The other one still with psych?
- There were two survivors.

55
00:05:48,064 --> 00:05:50,224
Looking for some answers,
but it's gonna take a while.

56
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,669
Testimony after trauma
like this is useless anyway.

57
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:56,906
Witnesses lie,
the camera doesn't.

58
00:05:57,006 --> 00:05:58,941
Capture's complete.
Popcorn's hot.

59
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,611
- Let's hope they caught something.
- They better have.

60
00:06:01,711 --> 00:06:03,546
We got a pile of
dead bodies out there.

61
00:06:03,646 --> 00:06:06,049
These videos could be
the best evidence we've got.

62
00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:08,367
Okay. Do it.

63
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:29,572
(Garbled audio)

64
00:06:29,672 --> 00:06:31,974
...is the man that holds
the power of God.

65
00:06:32,074 --> 00:06:35,026
That is true greatness.

66
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:40,583
Oh, that wasn't
good, was it?

67
00:06:40,683 --> 00:06:43,052
(Second woman
talking and laughing)

68
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,687
Is it too much?

69
00:06:44,787 --> 00:06:47,390
I can't tell.
I'm a terrible actor.

70
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,525
Leann, if I was watching it,
I'd eat it up, so...

71
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,625
- Really?
- Literally. I would totally believe it.

72
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,695
Good. Then we got it.

73
00:06:52,795 --> 00:06:54,497
You promised me
at least--

74
00:06:54,597 --> 00:06:56,833
no, no, leann.
You said at least five.

75
00:06:56,933 --> 00:06:59,068
You said...
All right, all right.

76
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,768
Hold on.

77
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,706
(People talking
indistinctly)

78
00:07:03,806 --> 00:07:06,576
Woman: It's beautiful.
What are you playing there?

79
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,544
- (Man answers indistinctly)
- What's it called?

80
00:07:08,644 --> 00:07:11,663
- It's called--
- shit! Put it down!

81
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:18,904
- (Knocking on door)
- (Woman laughing)

82
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:23,493
(Footsteps approaching)

83
00:07:23,593 --> 00:07:25,393
Surprise!

84
00:07:26,596 --> 00:07:28,796
Oh, my God!

85
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,001
Man: I can't believe
you got the part.

86
00:07:32,101 --> 00:07:33,870
Oh, my God!

87
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,005
You're a shining star.

88
00:07:36,105 --> 00:07:37,974
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

89
00:07:38,074 --> 00:07:41,077
A little late,
but better late than never, right?

90
00:07:41,177 --> 00:07:43,513
Did you do this?

91
00:07:43,613 --> 00:07:45,982
Yeah. All single-handedly,
I might add.

92
00:07:46,082 --> 00:07:47,784
Oh, really?

93
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,936
Oh, my God,
this is amazing, you guys.

94
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,834
Leann, you look
beautiful.

95
00:08:04,934 --> 00:08:08,137
Such a nice light.

96
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:10,222
It's perfect.

97
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,776
What are you
thinking about?

98
00:08:13,876 --> 00:08:14,676
Huh?

99
00:08:15,978 --> 00:08:20,082
That just two years ago,

100
00:08:20,182 --> 00:08:22,218
I was back home
in Kansas,

101
00:08:22,318 --> 00:08:25,521
working at my dad's
flower shop.

102
00:08:25,621 --> 00:08:28,124
I remember dreaming
of this moment.

103
00:08:28,224 --> 00:08:30,059
Being up on the stage

104
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:32,195
was all I ever
thought about.

105
00:08:32,295 --> 00:08:35,064
All those acting classes...

106
00:08:35,164 --> 00:08:37,233
Then you
met me.

107
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,035
Now look at us.

108
00:08:39,135 --> 00:08:41,537
I mean, you're filming
this documentary,

109
00:08:41,637 --> 00:08:45,541
and if this play
goes well, this could be it.

110
00:08:45,641 --> 00:08:48,911
What's the matter
then?

111
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:51,247
- Leann?
- Hmm?

112
00:08:51,347 --> 00:08:55,051
- Give me that.
- No, no, no.

113
00:08:55,151 --> 00:08:57,253
Last time,
you nearly broke it.

114
00:08:57,353 --> 00:09:00,022
Okay, fine. Hi.

115
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:01,991
- Hi, Rachel.
- Hello, everyone.

116
00:09:02,091 --> 00:09:03,693
Oh, is little
director shy?

117
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,761
- A little bit.
- Oh, but you're so cute.

118
00:09:05,861 --> 00:09:08,965
You're so annoying.
Nobody wants to see me.

119
00:09:09,065 --> 00:09:10,933
Oh, wow!
Don't get that close.

120
00:09:11,033 --> 00:09:13,202
I see something
on your head.

121
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,771
There's all kinds of
disasters happening here.

122
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:17,673
Please let me just
film you again,

123
00:09:17,773 --> 00:09:19,675
because you're what
everybody cares about.

124
00:09:19,775 --> 00:09:21,677
No, but you're
so frickin' cute.

125
00:09:21,777 --> 00:09:23,713
Compromise. We'll both
get in there, okay?

126
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,115
At least
you're in it.

127
00:09:26,215 --> 00:09:28,718
Even though I look like a
goddamn goblin next to you.

128
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,120
Okay, so, America,

129
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,556
are you ready...
Oh, God.

130
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,291
For the story of
leann hookplat...

131
00:09:35,391 --> 00:09:37,693
From the girl
next door...

132
00:09:37,793 --> 00:09:41,046
- To America's...
- (Static)

133
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:49,305
Okay,
what's the deal?

134
00:09:49,405 --> 00:09:52,808
The fire corrupted
a lot of the video.

135
00:09:52,908 --> 00:09:56,746
Okay, fast-forward it to the truck yard.
That's all that matters.

136
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,981
No, no, no.

137
00:09:59,081 --> 00:10:01,841
- We need to see the details, the relationships.
- It's not relevant.

138
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:04,202
- It doesn't matter.
- Everything on this tape matters.

139
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:09,859
You heard him.

140
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:11,176
All right.

141
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:20,236
The truth had cut me like
the grim reaper's blade itself.

142
00:10:20,336 --> 00:10:22,905
Any man who wields
the power of life and death

143
00:10:23,005 --> 00:10:25,608
is a man that holds
the power of God.

144
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,910
That is true greatness.

145
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:30,580
And though life
may be short,

146
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,582
and death sudden,

147
00:10:32,682 --> 00:10:35,166
true greatness
lasts forever.

148
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:38,702
(Applause)

149
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:48,097
Oh, my God! There's
my little superstar.

150
00:10:48,197 --> 00:10:50,166
Did you like it, really?

151
00:10:50,266 --> 00:10:52,466
Of course. Look, I've got goosebumps.
I'm proud of you.

152
00:10:52,435 --> 00:10:54,837
Do you think any of
this footage is gonna be good?

153
00:10:54,937 --> 00:10:57,373
Are you kidding?
This is gonna be a priceless documentary.

154
00:10:57,473 --> 00:10:59,742
You're gonna be
really famous.

155
00:10:59,842 --> 00:11:02,278
Rach, you and me are gonna
make a movie together one day.

156
00:11:02,378 --> 00:11:04,814
Just you and I.
It's gonna be a masterpiece.

157
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,434
- (Audience applauding)
- Get back out there. Take another bow.

158
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:10,086
- You gonna film it?
- Of course. Don't be stupid.

159
00:11:10,186 --> 00:11:12,937

- Leann.

- No, I'm fine.

175
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,784
Just talk to him,
I guess.

176
00:12:48,884 --> 00:12:52,470
I'll make sure
that it gets to him, okay?

177
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,908
Hi, Tyler.

178
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:01,363
I tried to call you,

179
00:13:01,463 --> 00:13:03,099
and Rachel said
you would watch this,

180
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,168
so... I'm sorry.

181
00:13:06,268 --> 00:13:08,137
You just,
you caught me off-guard,

182
00:13:08,237 --> 00:13:10,372
and I panicked.

183
00:13:10,472 --> 00:13:11,272
I...

184
00:13:12,842 --> 00:13:17,012
I didn't know
what else to do.

185
00:13:17,112 --> 00:13:18,814
Um... hi.

186
00:13:18,914 --> 00:13:20,816
I really think that
you should come,

187
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:23,152
and I simply can't
take no for an answer.

188
00:13:23,252 --> 00:13:25,421
This is supposed to be
our big celebration.

189
00:13:25,521 --> 00:13:29,291
I think it would be a real
shame to waste these tickets.

190
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,927
Um... I don't know.

191
00:13:32,027 --> 00:13:36,165
I think we've got the room,
we've got the bus.

192
00:13:36,265 --> 00:13:39,902
It'll all be
really fun.

193
00:13:40,002 --> 00:13:42,471
I think you'll forget
about it in an instant,

194
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:45,141
and I know
she's really sorry.

195
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,208
She's been
really boring.

196
00:13:46,308 --> 00:13:48,344
Um, please come.

197
00:13:48,444 --> 00:13:52,181
I promise I'll be more tolerant of your singing,

198
00:13:52,281 --> 00:13:55,166
which I find
really hard, but okay.

199
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,303
Um, look,

200
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,225
I know you probably
hate me,

201
00:14:03,325 --> 00:14:05,194
and I don't blame you,

202
00:14:05,294 --> 00:14:07,797
but this trip just
won't work without you.

203
00:14:07,897 --> 00:14:10,065
Please come.

204
00:14:10,165 --> 00:14:11,565
Just...

205
00:14:12,301 --> 00:14:15,838
I'm not ready
for marriage right now,

206
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:19,208
but maybe I will be...
One day.

207
00:14:19,308 --> 00:14:21,993
I still love you.

208
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:26,515
You gonna film this?

209
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:29,018
Yeah, I've gotta
film everything.

210
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,853
That was
the deal, remember?

211
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,855
But if he doesn't come,
I look like a loser.

212
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,195
Leann, that's the whole point
of documentary filmmaking.

213
00:14:35,224 --> 00:14:37,259
You've gotta get everything.
We had a deal.

214
00:14:37,359 --> 00:14:39,595
I guess he still has time to make it,
do you think?

215
00:14:39,695 --> 00:14:41,096
Not as much time
as you'd think.

216
00:14:41,196 --> 00:14:43,399
Oh, he looks
friendly, doesn't he?

217
00:14:43,499 --> 00:14:45,334
Yeah.
- (Rachel laughs)

218
00:14:45,434 --> 00:14:47,469
Do you know
what time it is?

219
00:14:47,569 --> 00:14:50,139
Here's the luxury vehicle we've been supplied.

220
00:14:50,239 --> 00:14:52,608
- Oh, hello.
- Travel in style.

221
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:55,077
Is there gonna be
a problem?

222
00:14:55,177 --> 00:14:57,246
It's a camera,
not a gun.

223
00:14:57,346 --> 00:15:00,282
I'm gonna grab these.
We gotta get on. Running late.

224
00:15:00,382 --> 00:15:03,352
- Tyler's here.
- Ooh, is that him?

225
00:15:03,452 --> 00:15:05,052
Perfect.

226
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:12,543
Mmm, he looks
jolly.

227
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,466
Fantastic.

228
00:15:17,566 --> 00:15:20,536
Oh, he brought
his guitar. Great.

229
00:15:20,636 --> 00:15:24,188
Well, viva Las Vegas,
everybody.

230
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:28,477
Hi, Tyler.
Oh, charming.

231
00:15:28,577 --> 00:15:32,030
Here is the happy,
happy couple.

232
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:37,486
Does she have
to be here?

233
00:15:37,586 --> 00:15:39,355
Can you turn
that thing off?

234
00:15:39,455 --> 00:15:41,290
Hi. I don't know
if we've met before,

235
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,025
but I'm Rachel.
And I like to film things.

236
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:46,462
Incredibly uncomfortable
things, so, no.

237
00:15:46,562 --> 00:15:49,632
I said I was sorry,
all right?

238
00:15:49,732 --> 00:15:52,935
I showed up,
didn't I?

239
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:56,405
Yeah, but can't we just go
back to the way things were.

240
00:15:56,505 --> 00:15:57,905
Please.

241
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:05,347
Huh. All right,
well, I guess

242
00:16:05,447 --> 00:16:09,018
I'll just cut this part out then.
That's fine.

243
00:16:09,118 --> 00:16:11,020
You can't fix this
with editing.

244
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,222
I can fix anything
with editing.

245
00:16:13,322 --> 00:16:15,925
You know what?
Just because he doesn't wanna have fun

246
00:16:16,025 --> 00:16:18,027
doesn't mean that we
can't have fun for him.

247
00:16:18,127 --> 00:16:19,461
Rachel: Exactly.

248
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:21,630
- No. No fun ever.
- Ever.

249
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,633
- Ever.
- Ooh, time to meet the cast.

250
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,468
(Rachel humming
fanfare)

251
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,370
She's cute.

252
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,239
First stop.

253
00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:32,090
(Leann laughing)

254
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:41,317
- What are you doing?
- I'm filming.

255
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,052
Vicki, where are you
from originally?

256
00:16:43,152 --> 00:16:44,520
From Russia.

257
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,388
- What brings you here?
- I'm dancing.

258
00:16:46,488 --> 00:16:48,457
Cool. You look
like a dancer.

259
00:16:48,557 --> 00:16:50,192
I love your camera.

260
00:16:50,292 --> 00:16:52,127
My son, he would like
something like this.

261
00:16:52,227 --> 00:16:53,395
Is it heavy?

262
00:16:53,495 --> 00:16:55,680
It's actually
not that heavy.

263
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:02,004
Hello. It's actually got
really good quality picture,

264
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,239
so it's worth
the weight.

265
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:05,708
I'll take it back.

266
00:17:05,808 --> 00:17:07,710
He skateboards.

267
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:11,213
Him and his friends
always take pictures and stuff.

268
00:17:11,313 --> 00:17:13,716
So what's this for again?

269
00:17:13,816 --> 00:17:17,419
Um, it's for my friend back there, leann,

270
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:19,254
who is gonna be a ultra-famous movie star,

271
00:17:19,354 --> 00:17:21,357
and it's kinda like
one of those

272
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,459
"before they were famous"
type shows.

273
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:25,527
Do you have that
in Russia?

274
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,763
- Before they were stars?
- I love the show, yeah.

275
00:17:27,863 --> 00:17:31,133
Yeah. We're
all fans.

276
00:17:31,233 --> 00:17:34,003
Including you,
Tyler.

277
00:17:34,103 --> 00:17:37,439
So Vicki, tell us more about this
show you're auditioning for.

278
00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:39,508
It's the new cirque
extravaganza.

279
00:17:39,608 --> 00:17:42,077
Oh, wow, you must be
so thrilled.

280
00:17:42,177 --> 00:17:44,580
I'm a pisces,

281
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,149
so this is like
the universe and the stars

282
00:17:47,249 --> 00:17:49,251
are perfectly aligned
to give me the job.

283
00:17:49,351 --> 00:17:50,652
I was born for it.

284
00:17:50,752 --> 00:17:52,621
It's my dream.

285
00:17:52,721 --> 00:17:55,157
That's great.
Very exciting.

286
00:17:55,257 --> 00:17:57,526
Ooh, is that
a present I can see?

287
00:17:57,626 --> 00:17:59,528
Is it your
birthday?

288
00:17:59,628 --> 00:18:00,796
No. It's my son's.

289
00:18:00,896 --> 00:18:03,132
What'd you
get him?

290
00:18:03,232 --> 00:18:05,234
I'm sorry,
it's personal.

291
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,752
Oh, it's okay.

292
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,789
- Should we cut?
- Yeah, all right.

293
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:18,129
(Tyler strumming
guitar)

294
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:29,173
Got another one.

295
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:35,764
He looks
quite sweet.

296
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:38,600
(Leann and Rachel
laughing)

297
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,335
- Hi.
- Hey.

298
00:18:40,435 --> 00:18:41,804
- Say hello.
- Hello.

299
00:18:41,904 --> 00:18:43,572
- What's your name?
- Steven.

300
00:18:43,672 --> 00:18:45,674
- Where you from?
- Wait. How old are you?

301
00:18:45,774 --> 00:18:48,477
- Sixteen.
- You can't even work yet.

302
00:18:48,577 --> 00:18:50,813
- What are you gonna do in Vegas?
- Be an apprentice.

303
00:18:50,913 --> 00:18:53,415
Does your mom
even know you're gone?

304
00:18:53,515 --> 00:18:56,318
Do you wanna see
a trick or not?

305
00:18:56,418 --> 00:18:59,288
Yeah, okay.
So we're here with Steven Lee,

306
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:02,424
or should I call you
the great Stefan?

307
00:19:02,524 --> 00:19:04,359
(Laughter)

308
00:19:04,459 --> 00:19:07,629
I can show you guys
the morph and match,

309
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,647
or maybe even
the coin...

310
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,536
God, did you see that?
That was crazy!

311
00:19:14,636 --> 00:19:16,839
Oh, my God, you have to show Tyler.
Tyler, come here.

312
00:19:16,939 --> 00:19:19,541
Rachel: You should put that on YouTube;
You'd get a million hits.

313
00:19:19,641 --> 00:19:22,201
Seriously, that's amazing.
Will you do it one more time, please?

314
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,710
Okay.

315
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:26,697
Freeze frame.

316
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:30,367
Go back.

317
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,837
Stop the tape.

318
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,508
Who's that?

319
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,745
Go back
a few frames.

320
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,537
There's only three women
on the passenger list--

321
00:19:48,637 --> 00:19:52,407
Rachel Brody, Vicki maracova,
and leann hookplat.

322
00:19:52,507 --> 00:19:54,443
She wasn't
supposed to be there.

323
00:19:54,543 --> 00:19:57,962
Advance forward
three frames.

324
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:03,385
- Capture that frame and advance one more.
- Sure.

325
00:20:03,485 --> 00:20:04,786
Got it.

326
00:20:04,886 --> 00:20:06,470
Capture again
and then overlay.

327
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:12,776
Zoom 35 %.

328
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:17,715
- And what's that inside?
- Pan the image.

329
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,374
- Wow.
- That's gotta be 100 grand easy.

330
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,942
We may have found
our motive.

331
00:20:27,042 --> 00:20:29,322
But if he wanted the money,
why not kill her and take it?

332
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:31,446
Why slaughter
all the others?

333
00:20:31,546 --> 00:20:33,965
Go over to the dog carrier
on the edge of the bag.

334
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:36,919
That's army issue.

335
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:38,736
And capture that frame.

336
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,873
"G. Fleishman."

337
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,729
I don't know,
maybe Gina or glenda.

338
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:50,299
Call fort irwin, have them
run it through their database

339
00:20:50,399 --> 00:20:52,367
of reserved and retired
military personnel

340
00:20:52,467 --> 00:20:54,570
in California
and Nevada.

341
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,238
Let's see
what they've got.

342
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,907
Keep going. I want to see
who this woman is.

343
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:02,644
Leann: That's amazing.
Will you do it one more time, please?

344
00:21:02,744 --> 00:21:05,396
(Tyler singing)

345
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,600
Rachel:
Whoo! All right!

346
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,368
(Light applause)

347
00:21:26,468 --> 00:21:27,748
All right,
just a quick thought.

348
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:29,571
Should it be
taking this long?

349
00:21:29,671 --> 00:21:31,907
I don't know, but I've been
to Vegas 100 times,

350
00:21:32,007 --> 00:21:34,592
and I've never seen
this road before.

351
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:43,067
I'm gonna go and have a
word with what's-his-face.

352
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:45,887
Excuse me. Sorry.

353
00:21:45,987 --> 00:21:47,187
Hello.

354
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:50,292
So, um, much longer?

355
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,294
What's with the camera?

356
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,463
I'm a director.

357
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,598
You been paid
to direct anything?

358
00:21:56,698 --> 00:21:58,267
No, not yet, but...

359
00:21:58,367 --> 00:22:00,669
So you're a girl
with a camera.

360
00:22:00,769 --> 00:22:03,538
Right. Can I ask why
we're going this way,

361
00:22:03,638 --> 00:22:05,540
because it's not
actually a road out there.

362
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,876
That's a dirt track,
by the looks of it.

363
00:22:07,976 --> 00:22:10,412
I have another pick-up
past kidwell.

364
00:22:10,512 --> 00:22:11,813
This is the only way in.

365
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,583
Woman: Stop your damn
complaining!

366
00:22:14,683 --> 00:22:16,685
Excuse me. I was
only asking.

367
00:22:16,785 --> 00:22:18,954
Get that damn thing
out of my face.

368
00:22:19,054 --> 00:22:20,455
What? Sit down.

369
00:22:20,555 --> 00:22:22,557
Out of my face!

370
00:22:22,657 --> 00:22:26,561
Oh, my God!
You fucking psychopath!

371
00:22:26,661 --> 00:22:29,031
- Jesus Christ.
- You all right?

372
00:22:29,131 --> 00:22:30,766
Are you okay?

373
00:22:30,866 --> 00:22:33,718
(Loud crashing)

374
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:01,963
(Distorted snippets
of conversation)

375
00:23:02,063 --> 00:23:03,632
Driver: Out, out, out.

376
00:23:03,732 --> 00:23:06,884
Get out of
the mini-van.

377
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,360
Rachel: Get away from the bus,
it might explode.

378
00:23:30,225 --> 00:23:32,561
It could be
dangerous.

379
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:36,131
What were you
expecting out here?

380
00:23:36,231 --> 00:23:37,833
What about the radio?

381
00:23:37,933 --> 00:23:39,835
Driver: The radio
was pulled a year ago.

382
00:23:39,935 --> 00:23:41,870
We gotta use
the cell phone.

383
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:44,106
What do you mean,
they pulled out the radio?

384
00:23:44,206 --> 00:23:46,074
Brilliant.
Brilliant news.

385
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:48,134
Okay, what are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

386
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:49,810
Fuck me.

387
00:23:50,946 --> 00:23:53,448
Leann: What the fuck
is that?

388
00:23:53,548 --> 00:23:56,618
Driver:
Looks like barbed wire.

389
00:23:56,718 --> 00:23:58,720
It came from
that fence over there.

390
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:01,089
Oh, my God!
Why didn't you drive around it?

391
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:02,891
I couldn't see it, could I?

392
00:24:02,991 --> 00:24:04,860
Stop fighting.
This isn't helping anything.

393
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,729
Leann: So what are
we gonna do?

394
00:24:07,829 --> 00:24:10,165
We can't go anywhere.
Look at Vicki's leg.

395
00:24:10,265 --> 00:24:13,435
- I'm fine.
- You're not fine. You're bleeding.

396
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,137
There's an emergency phone.

397
00:24:15,237 --> 00:24:18,106
There has to be one
at that truck repair shop.

398
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,008
I didn't see
a truck repair shop.

399
00:24:20,108 --> 00:24:21,710
We just passed it.

400
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:23,645
Look, I believe him.

401
00:24:23,745 --> 00:24:25,547
If he says there's
a truck repair shop...

402
00:24:25,647 --> 00:24:28,850
I haven't seen anything this entire journey, Tyler.

403
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:31,153
Let's just try
and walk down there.

404
00:24:31,253 --> 00:24:33,188
I haven't seen another fucking living person.

405
00:24:33,288 --> 00:24:35,690
It's not that far back.
Let's go.

406
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:37,590
Let's go.

407
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:39,661
Wait, I'm not leaving
without my son's present.

408
00:24:39,761 --> 00:24:41,161
Vicki, come on,
we don't have time.

409
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:43,498
(All talking
at once)

410
00:24:43,598 --> 00:24:45,901
It's not safe
in there!

411
00:24:46,001 --> 00:24:47,869
You can't
be serious.

412
00:24:47,969 --> 00:24:50,105
- Vicki!
- It's not worth it.

413
00:24:50,205 --> 00:24:51,706
Get the fuck
out of there!

414
00:24:51,806 --> 00:24:53,775
Driver: I'll go.
I'll go.

415
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:55,710
I don't trust
this guy.

416
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:57,813
We're not quite
in Vegas yet,

417
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,081
but we'll get there
eventually.

418
00:25:00,181 --> 00:25:02,217
It's a bit of
an adventure.

419
00:25:02,317 --> 00:25:05,086
And there's our
now-destroyed bus,

420
00:25:05,186 --> 00:25:07,889
which is fantastic
news for us.

421
00:25:07,989 --> 00:25:11,389
Okay. Here we go.

422
00:25:12,894 --> 00:25:15,797
I'm thinkin',
what if I died?

423
00:25:15,897 --> 00:25:18,200
I won't ever see
my mom again.

424
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,636
What happened?
Did you run away?

425
00:25:21,736 --> 00:25:24,072
Yeah.
Nick happened.

426
00:25:24,172 --> 00:25:26,372
Who's Nick?

427
00:25:26,641 --> 00:25:29,544
An asshole who was
ruining my life.

428
00:25:29,644 --> 00:25:30,444
Huh.

429
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:35,150
My mom, she just lets him
do whatever he wants,

430
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:38,086
and I got pissed
and I just left

431
00:25:38,186 --> 00:25:40,555
without saying
anything.

432
00:25:40,655 --> 00:25:42,858
She's probably worried
sick about you.

433
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:46,544
Yeah, I need to tell her
I'm sorry.

434
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:52,016
Leann, leann,
come here for a second.

435
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,705
With everything
that's happening,

436
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,923
does it put everything
into perspective?

437
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:04,328
Does almost dying kind of put
everything in perspective?

438
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:11,586
That's right.

439
00:26:11,686 --> 00:26:13,804
We all could've...

440
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:20,944
Jesus.

441
00:26:22,263 --> 00:26:25,349
Tyler: Looks like a bomb
hit this place.

442
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:31,989
As long as they didn't
bomb the damn phone.

443
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:41,364
Come on.

444
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,033
- How's your leg?
- It's fine.

445
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:58,008
Are there, like,
faucets or something?

446
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:05,916
It's all rusted over.

447
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:12,741
The new favorite
holiday destination

448
00:28:12,841 --> 00:28:15,410
of most people.

449
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:18,813
Over here we have, um,

450
00:28:18,913 --> 00:28:21,131
dilapidated office.

451
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,869
Crazy broad,
and, um...

452
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:30,158
Abandoned trucks.

453
00:28:30,258 --> 00:28:31,993
Everything you could want

454
00:28:32,093 --> 00:28:35,479
in a prime holiday
destination. Fantastic.

455
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,116
Vicki: She was
a figure skater.

456
00:28:55,216 --> 00:28:58,286
Ah. Bet she won gold
in Torino.

457
00:28:58,386 --> 00:29:01,056
We got a phone in
this building back here.

458
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:03,158
It's gettin' too dark.
Wires are all jumbled up.

459
00:29:03,258 --> 00:29:05,093
Does that thing
have a light on it?

460
00:29:05,193 --> 00:29:07,729
Yeah, it's got a light,
and it's got night vision,

461
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,431
so it'll
be perfect.

462
00:29:09,531 --> 00:29:11,066
That's for her movie.
Use mine.

463
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,101
Are you sure?

464
00:29:13,201 --> 00:29:15,804
I put batteries in this stupid thing three times.

465
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:18,422
Press "record,"
and the light should come on.

466
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:21,925
I'm happy someone's
using it.

467
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:27,182
How you like it, huh?

468
00:29:27,282 --> 00:29:29,384
Not so much fun
like this, is it?

469
00:29:29,484 --> 00:29:32,454
Hm. It's fine.
Just more proof for when I sue you.

470
00:29:32,554 --> 00:29:35,023
Find everybody,
tell 'em to meet here.

471
00:29:35,123 --> 00:29:37,243
I don't wanna be out here
any longer than we have to.

472
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:38,125
Okay.

473
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:50,554
Leann.

474
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:57,245
Leann, Ben's
found a phone, so...

475
00:29:57,345 --> 00:29:59,347
He wants me to
get everyone.

476
00:29:59,447 --> 00:30:01,932
Can you...
Are you in here?

477
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,958
(Loud static)

478
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,472
(Rachel shrieks)

479
00:31:31,572 --> 00:31:34,075
Oh, my God,
what happened?

480
00:31:34,175 --> 00:31:36,211
Where are
you going?

481
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,479
Steven, wait.

482
00:31:38,579 --> 00:31:40,179
Someone!

483
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,584
Anybody, please!

484
00:31:42,684 --> 00:31:44,552
What's going on?

485
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:47,155
I don't know.
I don't know what happened.

486
00:31:47,255 --> 00:31:50,892
(All yelling
at once)

487
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,961
I just found him.

488
00:31:53,061 --> 00:31:57,265
(Rachel crying
and speaking incoherently)

489
00:31:57,365 --> 00:32:00,969
He just came
out of nowhere.

490
00:32:01,069 --> 00:32:04,239
Oh, my God, you guys,
I see somebody.

491
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,374
Oh, my God,
he just ran across.

492
00:32:06,474 --> 00:32:08,977
Tyler: Everybody inside.
Everybody inside.

493
00:32:09,077 --> 00:32:12,647
Ben: Come on,
come on, come on.

494
00:32:12,747 --> 00:32:15,483
First victim,
Steven Lee.

495
00:32:15,583 --> 00:32:17,401
Sixteen years old.

496
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:23,458
Got him.
It's not her name, it's his.

497
00:32:23,558 --> 00:32:25,260
Gerald fleishman,
retired army sergeant.

498
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,264
Photo lab found
these online.

499
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:32,066
- That's our girl.
- His wife, Katrina fleishman.

500
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:34,903
Married for 20 years,
but looks like Gerald had some problems

501
00:32:35,003 --> 00:32:36,471
when he got back
from Iraq.

502
00:32:36,571 --> 00:32:38,673
They called it
post-traumatic stress.

503
00:32:38,773 --> 00:32:40,853
He spent a year at Crescent
park mental institution.

504
00:32:40,608 --> 00:32:42,277
Get this, we just
ran financials.

505
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,946
His entire account
cleaned out two days ago.

506
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,981
Over 90 grand.

507
00:32:47,081 --> 00:32:49,517
Gabe, pull up the mini hd camera
the driver took around back,

508
00:32:49,617 --> 00:32:53,070
- and see if he got any clear shots of it.
- Okay.

509
00:32:58,343 --> 00:32:59,661
How do you like it, huh?

510
00:32:59,761 --> 00:33:02,430
Not so much fun
like this, is it?

511
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:04,132
Hm, it's fine.

512
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,200
Just more proof
for when I sue you, so...

513
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,202
Find everybody,
tell 'em to meet here.

514
00:33:08,302 --> 00:33:10,422
I don't wanna be out here
any longer than we have to.

515
00:33:10,338 --> 00:33:11,338
Okay.

516
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:21,131
Step over door.

517
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,247
What have we here?

518
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,382
(Loud popping)

519
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,682
Goddamn it!

520
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:38,842
(Generator powering up)

521
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,319
Son of a bitch...

522
00:34:57,528 --> 00:35:01,416
- Is that it?
- Uh, there should be more.

523
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,351
It's still rolling.

524
00:35:03,451 --> 00:35:06,269
We should be
seeing something.

525
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,426
- (Woman moaning)
- That's not our driver.

526
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:14,611
- Who is it?
- A better question is when is it?

527
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:50,547
(Screaming)

528
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:02,726
(Agonized screaming
continues)

529
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:17,725
- (Screaming continues)
- Geez.

530
00:36:17,825 --> 00:36:19,876
(Moans quietly)

531
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:30,520
(Screaming continues)

532
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:42,465
- All right, that's enough.
- Fuck!

533
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:52,642
I am gonna
nail this bastard.

534
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:02,786
Um, Gabe, go back
a few frames.

535
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:10,611
Keep going.
Keep going.

536
00:37:10,711 --> 00:37:12,914
In the reflection.
His face is in the glass.

537
00:37:13,014 --> 00:37:14,749
It's too dark.

538
00:37:14,849 --> 00:37:16,666
Get in closer.

539
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:23,858
Isolate the sharp
edges of the face.

540
00:37:23,958 --> 00:37:25,875
The wrinkles, the teeth,
the facial hair.

541
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:33,501
- Okay, what is he doing?
- The shadows will give us a clean outline,

542
00:37:33,601 --> 00:37:35,521
- then we'll invert the color.
- Okay, I got it.

543
00:37:35,469 --> 00:37:36,753
Reverse it again.

544
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:54,288
- A mask. - That's the welder's
mask we found at the scene.

545
00:37:54,388 --> 00:37:57,625
You work the 91-a.

546
00:37:57,725 --> 00:37:59,860
- What's a 91-a?
- He was a machinist.

547
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,230
Fleishman's unstable,
he has a history of violence,

548
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:04,465
his wife robs him blind,
he goes mad with revenge.

549
00:38:04,565 --> 00:38:06,701
- Circumstantial.
- Get it out to p.R.

550
00:38:06,801 --> 00:38:08,836
I want his picture on
every news outlet.

551
00:38:08,936 --> 00:38:10,571
We need to keep
checking the video.

552
00:38:10,671 --> 00:38:12,506
You find me some
indisputable evidence,

553
00:38:12,606 --> 00:38:15,243
'cause I'm taking this prick
straight to the chair.

554
00:38:15,343 --> 00:38:17,311
You heard her.

555
00:38:17,411 --> 00:38:20,581
- Let's go.
- Rachel's camera coming up.

556
00:38:20,681 --> 00:38:22,883
(All talking
at once)

557
00:38:22,983 --> 00:38:26,636
(Rachel sobbing
and speaking incoherently)

558
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:32,660
Tyler: Everybody
stay quiet.

559
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,795
Ben: Be quiet!

560
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:36,564
They killed him.

561
00:38:36,664 --> 00:38:38,532
I didn't see anybody
from this end.

562
00:38:38,632 --> 00:38:40,334
You see anything?

563
00:38:40,434 --> 00:38:42,670
Why did they kill Steven?
He was just a kid.

564
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:45,273
Ben: Will you turn
that goddamn camera off?!

565
00:38:45,373 --> 00:38:47,475
The cops will need this
to identify who did this.

566
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,978
(All talking at once)

567
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:54,515
They have to know
what happened to us!

568
00:38:54,615 --> 00:38:57,718
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do, what are we gonna do?

569
00:38:57,818 --> 00:38:59,587
Tyler: Maybe we
should run for it.

570
00:38:59,687 --> 00:39:02,957
Run for it?
Have you seen Vicki's leg, Tyler?

571
00:39:03,057 --> 00:39:06,827
We're, like, 40 Miles
away from anything.

572
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:09,363
Ben: And it's
pitch black out there.

573
00:39:09,463 --> 00:39:11,932
We could fall into
a 40-foot ditch,

574
00:39:12,032 --> 00:39:14,792
and never even know it,
not to mention the coyotes, the rattlesnakes.

575
00:39:14,735 --> 00:39:16,671
No, you said there was
an emergency phone.

576
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:19,507
You said there was an emergency phone.
Can't you fix it?

577
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,876
The wires are split
pretty bad.

578
00:39:21,976 --> 00:39:23,611
Leann: Isn't there anything
on the bus,

579
00:39:23,711 --> 00:39:26,080
any wires, tools,
anything you can use?

580
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,015
I might be able
to rig something.

581
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:30,351
You just said
it was too dangerous.

582
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:32,851
But if there's something we can use,
he has to go out there.

583
00:39:32,753 --> 00:39:34,889
Take my camera,
use the light.

584
00:39:34,989 --> 00:39:37,058
I might as well put a bull's-eye on my ass.

585
00:39:37,158 --> 00:39:39,327
My camera has night vision.
If I come with you,

586
00:39:39,427 --> 00:39:41,395
we could do that and be totally undetectable.

587
00:39:41,495 --> 00:39:43,998
I'll take your camera.
Give me--

588
00:39:44,098 --> 00:39:46,467
I'm sorry if I was
a prick earlier.

589
00:39:46,567 --> 00:39:48,767
You? Never.

590
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:51,405
I guess it's my turn
to be a hero now.

591
00:39:51,505 --> 00:39:53,040
They tell me I look
like tom cruise.

592
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,576
Oddly enough,
I can see that.

593
00:39:55,676 --> 00:39:58,579
I saw him, I saw him.
He's on the other side of the yard.

594
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:00,715
You have to go.

595
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,483
Follow me.

596
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:04,118
Can you take that?

597
00:40:04,218 --> 00:40:06,403
Go, go, go, quick!

598
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:57,987
Rachel!

599
00:40:58,138 --> 00:41:00,074
Oh, my God.

600
00:41:00,174 --> 00:41:02,476
Ben. Okay, okay.
Come here.

601
00:41:02,576 --> 00:41:04,761
(Rachel whispering
indistinctly)

602
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:09,650
Okay, just
go straight.

603
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:12,135
Straight. Just keep going straight.
You're fine.

604
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:18,726
(Eerie sound)

605
00:41:18,826 --> 00:41:20,728
Oh, my God.
Did you hear that?

606
00:41:20,828 --> 00:41:22,463
(Rachel whimpering)

607
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:24,963
Ben: Sh. Sh.

608
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,735
The bus should be
right down this hill.

609
00:41:27,835 --> 00:41:30,587
- Okay.
- Let's keep going.

610
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:37,192
Wait.
Wait.

611
00:41:38,178 --> 00:41:40,714
Is that it?
I can't tell.

612
00:41:40,814 --> 00:41:43,117
Is it just...

613
00:41:43,217 --> 00:41:45,486
That's it,
that's it.

614
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:47,521
Oh, thank God.

615
00:41:47,621 --> 00:41:49,821
Oh, my God.

616
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,490
Rachel.

617
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:54,944
(Rachel sobbing)

618
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,238
I can see
the bus from here.

619
00:42:04,338 --> 00:42:06,574
Ben, Ben,
please.

620
00:42:06,674 --> 00:42:09,692
Please slow down.
You don't know what's out there.

621
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:33,000
What are you
waiting for? Huh?

622
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,900
I just...

623
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:46,780
I'm gonna need
some light.

624
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,932
Okay.
I'll figure it out.

625
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:53,120
Watch yourself.
Are you okay?

626
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,689
Just hurry up, please.

627
00:42:55,789 --> 00:42:58,692
I need to find my tools
so I can pull those speakers.

628
00:42:58,792 --> 00:43:00,227
Careful,
careful.

629
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:01,527
Wires.

630
00:43:02,262 --> 00:43:04,798
Up here, up here.

631
00:43:04,898 --> 00:43:06,983
- Yeah.
- Hurry.

632
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:20,147
- Shit.
- What, what?

633
00:43:20,247 --> 00:43:21,982
There was a flare gun.

634
00:43:22,082 --> 00:43:24,051
Why didn't you
say something?

635
00:43:24,151 --> 00:43:25,719
I forgot.

636
00:43:25,819 --> 00:43:27,870
Where is it?

637
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:31,625
(Crashing)

638
00:43:31,725 --> 00:43:34,061
(Screaming) Oh,
my God! Oh, my God!

639
00:43:34,161 --> 00:43:35,696
Who's out there?

640
00:43:35,796 --> 00:43:37,665
Can we please go?
Please, let's just go.

641
00:43:37,765 --> 00:43:40,034
- Wait here.
- Ben, please.

642
00:43:40,134 --> 00:43:42,269
You don't know
who's out there.

643
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:45,822
(Rachel whimpering)

644
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,904
You wanna fuck with me?

645
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:09,797
(Screaming)

646
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:12,015
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

647
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:24,426
(Shrieking)

648
00:44:24,978 --> 00:44:28,765
Please, please,
please.

649
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:48,284
Vicki: What happened?

650
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:54,375
- What?
- Ben's dead.

651
00:44:54,475 --> 00:44:56,275
(Sobbing)

652
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,254
Where's leann?

653
00:45:07,354 --> 00:45:09,056
Her and Tyler--
her and Tyler

654
00:45:09,156 --> 00:45:11,925
leann. Leann!
Where is she?!

655
00:45:12,025 --> 00:45:14,695
(Screaming
hysterically)

656
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:18,365
Stop that. She went
looking for you.

657
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:20,665
But they...

658
00:45:21,235 --> 00:45:24,320
They didn't come back.

659
00:45:29,827 --> 00:45:31,894
(Crashing sound)

660
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:42,972
My son turned ten
last week.

661
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:49,345
This was supposed to be
his birthday present.

662
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:54,401
When me and his dad
got divorced,

663
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:57,920
he had to choose
between us.

664
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:01,357
He chose his dad.

665
00:46:05,195 --> 00:46:07,915
Yesterday,
I was right there,

666
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:10,199
at the front
of his house.

667
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,240
And I didn't have...

668
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:25,766
I didn't have balls
to walk up and give him

669
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:28,266
his present.

670
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:31,788
I should tell him...

671
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,795
How sorry I am.

672
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:43,117
How I love him.

673
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:46,402
And I'm so damn scared.

674
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:50,190
What are we
gonna do?

675
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:51,759
He's here.

676
00:46:51,859 --> 00:46:52,859
What?

677
00:46:53,927 --> 00:46:55,496
He's here.

678
00:46:55,596 --> 00:46:58,381
Get the shot of him.

679
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:03,318
He's here.

680
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:19,134
(Shrieking)

681
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:53,020
Vicki: Wait, wait.
No, not yet.

682
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,322
Not yet,
not yet.

683
00:47:55,422 --> 00:47:57,506
Wait.
Okay, now. Now.

684
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:31,158
Leann, leann.
Oh, my God, oh, my God!

685
00:48:31,258 --> 00:48:33,709
(Both sobbing)

686
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:41,935
I heard Tyler screaming,
and when I turned around, he was gone.

687
00:48:42,035 --> 00:48:44,435
He was gone.

688
00:48:44,538 --> 00:48:46,338
(Sobbing)

689
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:02,422
It's pretty beat up.

690
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:05,058
I don't know how much
longer it's gonna record for.

691
00:49:05,158 --> 00:49:07,527
Do you really think filming
this matters anymore?

692
00:49:07,627 --> 00:49:10,279
Of course it does.
He has to pay for what he did.

693
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:14,350
And what he's
going to do.

694
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:26,546
(Whispering)
I know why you're here.

695
00:49:26,646 --> 00:49:28,615
What are
you doing?

696
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:30,651
Just sayin'
my piece.

697
00:49:30,751 --> 00:49:32,686
Do you know
something?

698
00:49:32,786 --> 00:49:35,289
If you know,
you better tell us.

699
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:36,690
Or what?

700
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:38,492
You gonna kill me?

701
00:49:38,592 --> 00:49:41,028
You're completely
mad.

702
00:49:41,128 --> 00:49:43,128
(Laughing)

703
00:49:44,698 --> 00:49:49,303
You think stayin' here's
gonna change something.

704
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:52,603
Now who's crazy?

705
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,709
Where are you going?
Come back.

706
00:49:55,809 --> 00:49:57,660
Shut the door!

707
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:01,197
Leann.

708
00:50:01,448 --> 00:50:03,583
I can't see her anymore.
Where'd she go.

709
00:50:03,683 --> 00:50:06,202
For God's sake, here, here.
Turn on the night--

710
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:12,308
maybe she's pregnant.

711
00:50:18,715 --> 00:50:21,635
Leann: Oh, my God,
I think I see something.

712
00:50:21,735 --> 00:50:24,571
It looks like...
I think it's a flare gun.

713
00:50:24,671 --> 00:50:27,007
Where? He just
dropped it there?

714
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:29,042
We could use it.
We have to go get it.

715
00:50:29,142 --> 00:50:31,378
Are you insane? If we
go out there, we're dead.

716
00:50:31,478 --> 00:50:33,981
What are we gonna do?
We can't just sit here.

717
00:50:34,081 --> 00:50:36,316
She's right. We have
to do something.

718
00:50:36,416 --> 00:50:39,336
- What if he has a gun?
- If he had a gun, he would have shot us already.

719
00:50:39,219 --> 00:50:41,722
This is gonna even out the field.
We need to get this.

720
00:50:41,822 --> 00:50:44,524
Okay, you really wanna
go out there

721
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:46,259
after what's happened
with Tyler?

722
00:50:46,359 --> 00:50:48,695
Is that what
you wanna do? Hm?

723
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:51,031
We have
to get it.

724
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:53,749
- What then?
- I'll go.

725
00:50:57,187 --> 00:51:00,374
Vicki, I don't think
this is a good idea.

726
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:04,011
My son will get
his present.

727
00:51:04,111 --> 00:51:06,580
No, wait,
wait, wait.

728
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:07,680
Wait.

729
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:13,102
Take this,
for luck.

730
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:32,788
Quick. Shut the door,
shut the door.

731
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:44,484
Rachel:
Oh, there she is.

732
00:51:44,584 --> 00:51:45,584
Okay.

733
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:56,312
Why is she moving so slowly?
Hurry up.

734
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:03,637
Oh, my God.

735
00:52:03,737 --> 00:52:05,172
No. Vicki!

736
00:52:05,272 --> 00:52:07,472
(Screaming)

737
00:52:41,391 --> 00:52:44,660
Come on, leann. Run!

738
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:02,796
Leann, get out
of there, quick.

739
00:53:02,896 --> 00:53:04,096
Leann!

740
00:53:07,317 --> 00:53:09,269
Where is he?

741
00:53:09,369 --> 00:53:12,506
Is he outside
the door?

742
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:15,457
- Leann.
- No, not yet.

743
00:53:16,726 --> 00:53:19,328
Which door
is he at?

744
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:23,399
Where the fuck
is he?

745
00:53:28,572 --> 00:53:30,372
Hurry up.

746
00:53:44,321 --> 00:53:46,506
I wish he'd
just do it.

747
00:53:46,606 --> 00:53:48,608
Don't say that.

748
00:53:48,708 --> 00:53:50,911
(Both women crying)

749
00:53:51,011 --> 00:53:54,230
I'm scared.
I'm so fucking scared.

750
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:58,901
(Loud banging)

751
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:03,806
Oh, my God! Quick.

752
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:10,546
Ben! You're alive.

753
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:17,237
I saw you. He grabbed you.
What happened?

754
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:18,872
He got me in the back.

755
00:54:18,972 --> 00:54:20,807
He left me out there
to die.

756
00:54:20,907 --> 00:54:22,676
Let me see.
Oh, my God!

757
00:54:22,776 --> 00:54:24,477
Fuck that guy.
I'm not dyin' today.

758
00:54:24,577 --> 00:54:26,413
And I got these.

759
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:28,548
- What is that?
- From the speakers.

760
00:54:28,648 --> 00:54:31,284
I can fix it now.
Red to red, green to green.

761
00:54:31,384 --> 00:54:33,787
The emergency phone.
We can call for help.

762
00:54:33,887 --> 00:54:36,423
We better be gettin' this.

763
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:38,474
We gotta go.

764
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:43,496
Hey, I'm checkin' footage
from Katrina's camera,

765
00:54:43,596 --> 00:54:46,733
and, uh, you're gonna
wanna see this.

766
00:54:46,833 --> 00:54:48,768
They found him.

767
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:51,805
Hotel manager in Hollywood
saw fleishman

768
00:54:51,905 --> 00:54:55,308
on the news, said he's been
staying in room 315 for a week.

769
00:54:55,408 --> 00:54:57,244
LAPD's sending grab team to pick him up now.

770
00:54:57,344 --> 00:54:59,928
- Whose camera is this?
- Told you you'd wanna see it.

771
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:03,316
(Whispering)

772
00:55:03,416 --> 00:55:05,801
I can't hear this.

773
00:55:08,672 --> 00:55:11,024
You watching, pigs?

774
00:55:11,124 --> 00:55:13,124
Yeah, you.

775
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:17,964
Bunch of pork,
scramblin' all over the desert,

776
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:21,016
tryin' to piece
this shit together.

777
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:25,338
Time to make
my dyin' wish,

778
00:55:25,438 --> 00:55:27,022
and all that.

779
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:29,609
I don't want much.

780
00:55:29,709 --> 00:55:34,047
Just wanna be with
the one that I love.

781
00:55:34,147 --> 00:55:37,317
His name is Gerry.

782
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:39,419
Gerry fleishman.

783
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:42,789
You make sure
I'm in the same plot.

784
00:55:42,889 --> 00:55:47,910
You bury me in
the same plot, you understand?

785
00:55:51,114 --> 00:55:55,835
We had our ups and downs
like any couple,

786
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:58,038
but after he got
back from Iraq,

787
00:55:58,138 --> 00:56:00,538
he was sick.

788
00:56:01,825 --> 00:56:03,892
He was real sick.

789
00:56:06,096 --> 00:56:09,816
I tried to reach him,

790
00:56:09,916 --> 00:56:12,316
to help him,

791
00:56:12,886 --> 00:56:15,922
but the old Gerry
was gone, just shut down.

792
00:56:16,022 --> 00:56:18,625
On top of that,
the doctor told him

793
00:56:18,725 --> 00:56:20,776
that he had cancer.

794
00:56:22,746 --> 00:56:25,665
Said he was
gonna rot away

795
00:56:25,765 --> 00:56:29,736
like some piece
of old fruit.

796
00:56:29,836 --> 00:56:32,087
Gerald fleishman, LAPD.
Open the door.

797
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:37,444
Fleishman, LAPD.
Open the fuckin' door.

798
00:56:37,544 --> 00:56:40,580
It's like the reality stars
you see on TV.

799
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:43,783
There ain't no reason
for them to be famous,

800
00:56:43,883 --> 00:56:45,634
but they are.

801
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:47,903
Break it down.

802
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:52,058
Drop the gun!
Drop the gun!

803
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:56,696
Like God just reached down
and touched 'em.

804
00:56:56,796 --> 00:57:00,100
Changed their whole lives
forever.

805
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:04,371
Well, he done the same
thing to my Gerry.

806
00:57:04,471 --> 00:57:07,674
But it wasn't no touch.

807
00:57:07,774 --> 00:57:10,774
It was a stomp.

808
00:57:17,033 --> 00:57:23,572
Looks like God's got
his stompin' boots on again.

809
00:57:28,912 --> 00:57:31,013
See ya soon, baby.

810
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:37,019
File's corrupted.

811
00:57:38,721 --> 00:57:41,674
Whoa. Dude, how'd he
get the camera?

812
00:57:41,774 --> 00:57:43,525
That's the guy.

813
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:58,839
There you are.

814
00:58:00,777 --> 00:58:02,945
I've been waiting for you.

815
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:17,292
It's you.

816
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:55,163
(Phone ringing)

817
00:58:56,232 --> 00:58:57,832
Stop it.

818
00:59:01,738 --> 00:59:03,338
Burquez.

819
00:59:03,856 --> 00:59:06,626
So we got a positive I.D.
On fleishman.

820
00:59:06,726 --> 00:59:10,630
But I guarantee you,
this guy,

821
00:59:10,730 --> 00:59:13,600
he didn't kill
anybody yesterday.

822
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:15,168
And why is that?

823
00:59:15,268 --> 00:59:18,137
Because he's been
dead at least a week.

824
00:59:18,237 --> 00:59:21,574
Apparent self-inflicted
gun wound into the mouth.

825
00:59:21,674 --> 00:59:23,142
Did leave a note, though.

826
00:59:23,242 --> 00:59:27,247
Says for Katrina,
take all of my money

827
00:59:27,347 --> 00:59:29,582
out of the bank
and go to Vegas.

828
00:59:29,682 --> 00:59:30,950
Says 'cause he's dead anyway,

829
00:59:31,050 --> 00:59:33,086
she should have
the time of her life.

830
00:59:33,186 --> 00:59:35,737
Anyway, I'll call you if
we get anything else.

831
00:59:38,107 --> 00:59:41,027
So if it's not
fleishman,

832
00:59:41,127 --> 00:59:42,228
uh, who is it?

833
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:45,347
It's him.
Play it.

834
01:00:18,648 --> 01:00:21,100
- What was that about?
- Rewind it.

835
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,218
Reverse it
and play it again.

836
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:48,328
He knew
we'd be watching.

837
01:00:48,428 --> 01:00:50,697
He's challenging us.

838
01:00:50,797 --> 01:00:55,101
This whole thing
was planned.

839
01:00:55,201 --> 01:00:56,836
The torch, the mask...

840
01:00:56,936 --> 01:00:59,339
It's some sort of fantasy,
a ritual.

841
01:00:59,439 --> 01:01:02,342
- Are you saying--
- I'm saying we're dealing with a serial killer.

842
01:01:02,442 --> 01:01:05,122
- Smart, meticulous, this wasn't his first.
- It won't be his last.

843
01:01:04,777 --> 01:01:06,646
How can he have
planned all this

844
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:08,986
- when the bus wreck was an accident?
- Unless he knew--

845
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:10,795
the driver mentioned a stop
outside of kidwell.

846
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:12,352
Could've buried
the fence wire.

847
01:01:12,452 --> 01:01:14,172
Shuttle company said
it was a nonstop trip.

848
01:01:14,153 --> 01:01:17,005
Then why go down the road
in the first place?

849
01:01:20,143 --> 01:01:23,396
Driver. Get me his file.
I want everything we can find on this guy now.

850
01:01:23,496 --> 01:01:25,714
Play back
the girl's camera.

851
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:43,231
Quick.

852
01:01:44,016 --> 01:01:46,252
Ben, are you sure
you're okay?

853
01:01:46,352 --> 01:01:47,887
Told you, I'm fine.

854
01:01:47,987 --> 01:01:49,756
I can't believe
you're still alive.

855
01:01:49,856 --> 01:01:51,991
I can't believe
he left you out there.

856
01:01:52,091 --> 01:01:54,260
- Oh, my God!
- The juice is low. Hurry.

857
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:56,829
No. That lady
might still be alive.

858
01:01:56,929 --> 01:01:58,798
We haven't got
time for this.

859
01:01:58,898 --> 01:02:00,667
We can't just ignore this.
We have to go in.

860
01:02:00,767 --> 01:02:03,351
I'm going in.
Oh, my God.

861
01:02:05,421 --> 01:02:09,442
(Girls retching
and screaming)

862
01:02:09,542 --> 01:02:12,912
Leann,
where is he?

863
01:02:13,012 --> 01:02:15,148
Leann.
Leann!

864
01:02:15,248 --> 01:02:17,717
Oh, my God.
Leann!

865
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:20,435
Please help me.

866
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:24,957
(Door bangs)
- (Women scream)

867
01:02:25,057 --> 01:02:27,457
Seen enough?

868
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:30,163
Wait, wait, wait.
Are you okay?

869
01:02:30,263 --> 01:02:31,898
I'm fine.

870
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:33,181
Okay. Just go.

871
01:02:45,995 --> 01:02:47,795
Ow. Fuck!

872
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:04,430
Run for the fuel house.
I'll be right behind you.

873
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:05,998
Are you ready?

874
01:03:06,098 --> 01:03:08,298
Go, go. Go.

875
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:32,425
Nobody's gettin' in here now.

876
01:03:32,525 --> 01:03:34,810
Phone's back that way.

877
01:03:40,516 --> 01:03:41,316
Ben?

878
01:03:42,501 --> 01:03:44,437
He was right behind me.

879
01:03:44,537 --> 01:03:45,337
Ben?

880
01:03:53,963 --> 01:03:56,598
- (Screaming) Run!
- Leann!

881
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:14,215
Leann?

882
01:04:32,268 --> 01:04:35,537
It's okay.
It's okay.

883
01:04:40,476 --> 01:04:43,296
Okay, I just
have to get out...

884
01:04:43,396 --> 01:04:45,513
I just have...

885
01:04:54,624 --> 01:04:57,092
(Metallic clattering)

886
01:05:04,433 --> 01:05:05,233
Ben?

887
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:08,070
Ben.

888
01:05:11,607 --> 01:05:13,675
Come on,
come on.

889
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:01,607
Okay, green to green.

890
01:06:01,707 --> 01:06:04,577
Green to green,
green to green, red to red.

891
01:06:04,677 --> 01:06:07,329
Red to red.
(Muttering incoherently)

892
01:06:11,701 --> 01:06:13,435
(Shrieking)

893
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:02,950
(Screaming)

894
01:07:40,823 --> 01:07:44,292
(Agonized screaming)

895
01:08:00,509 --> 01:08:02,709
Keep going.

896
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:07,215
That's it.
No more video.

897
01:08:09,718 --> 01:08:12,187
That's the end.

898
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:15,190
Fuck!

899
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:20,328
We have one more phone.

900
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:27,302
- Okay, play it.
- Haven't you seen enough?

901
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:36,162
Okay, so, mom, this is
where we're at right now.

902
01:08:36,262 --> 01:08:38,531
Um, takin' a little break.

903
01:08:38,631 --> 01:08:41,233
I just wanted to let you know
that I'm okay,

904
01:08:41,333 --> 01:08:44,103
and on my way to Vegas.

905
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:46,405
Uh, I shouldn't have left
like that.

906
01:08:46,505 --> 01:08:48,790
I was just mad and...

907
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:54,346
Tyler: I don't
trust you anymore.

908
01:08:54,446 --> 01:08:57,216
Leann: Trust me?
How is this a matter of trust?

909
01:08:57,316 --> 01:08:59,318
We didn't talk
about this.

910
01:08:59,418 --> 01:09:01,187
You didn't
ask me first.

911
01:09:01,287 --> 01:09:03,189
You didn't
prepare me.

912
01:09:03,289 --> 01:09:05,758
You just came up on my big moment
and asked me to marry you.

913
01:09:05,858 --> 01:09:08,658
(Both arguing)

914
01:09:08,827 --> 01:09:11,330
Stop being so needy.
What are you doing right now?

915
01:09:11,430 --> 01:09:13,599
We almost have a near-death experience,

916
01:09:13,699 --> 01:09:15,801
and you bring me
in here to do this?

917
01:09:15,901 --> 01:09:18,104
Oh, my God,
grow up! Stop!

918
01:09:18,204 --> 01:09:19,538
...my priorities
in life.

919
01:09:19,638 --> 01:09:20,739
- Your priorities?
- Yeah.

920
01:09:20,839 --> 01:09:21,841
I don't wanna
marry you.

921
01:09:21,941 --> 01:09:23,876
Get it through
your skull.

922
01:09:23,976 --> 01:09:26,112
I don't want
to marry you! God!

923
01:09:26,212 --> 01:09:27,680
Go write a fucking
song about it,

924
01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:30,116
and pretend to be
good at something.

925
01:09:30,216 --> 01:09:32,400
Jesus Christ!

926
01:09:37,206 --> 01:09:39,541
What the fuck
are you lookin' at?

927
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:43,829
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- What?

928
01:09:43,929 --> 01:09:46,432
I don't... I don't know.
There should be...

929
01:09:46,532 --> 01:09:48,767
There should be
more memory on the hard drive.

930
01:09:48,867 --> 01:09:51,837
It must've got, I guess,
erased or something.

931
01:09:51,937 --> 01:09:54,306
- Erased?
- There should be a memory card here.

932
01:09:54,406 --> 01:09:55,708
It's not...

933
01:09:55,808 --> 01:09:57,643
Okay, the memory card's
not in there and--

934
01:09:57,743 --> 01:09:59,645
- okay, where is it?
- Gabe.

935
01:09:59,745 --> 01:10:02,414
- I don't know.
- Gabe, sound. Sound on the TV.

936
01:10:02,514 --> 01:10:04,150
- I don't know.
- Sound.

937
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:06,352
- Uh, okay.
- Oh, shit.

938
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:08,921
- Reporter: <i>Yes, we can now confirm...</i>
<i>- Shit!</i>

939
01:10:09,021 --> 01:10:11,190
<i>The leaked footage is,</i>
<i>in fact, genuine.</i>

940
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:13,559
<i>It's being called</i>
<i>a snuff film.</i>

941
01:10:13,659 --> 01:10:16,829
<i>And others on the web are</i>
<i>calling it an instant classic.</i>

942
01:10:16,929 --> 01:10:18,764
<i>What we know for sure</i>
<i>is that this video</i>

943
01:10:18,864 --> 01:10:21,800
<i>has gone viral,</i>
<i>with over 3 million hits</i>

944
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:23,903
<i>in the last hour alone.</i>

945
01:10:24,003 --> 01:10:26,205
<i>We're attempting to trace</i>
<i>the original...</i>

946
01:10:26,305 --> 01:10:28,407
How the fuck
did she get that?

947
01:10:28,507 --> 01:10:29,942
<i>...Las Vegas</i>
<i>police department,</i>

948
01:10:30,042 --> 01:10:32,411
<i>and how this will affect</i>
<i>their investigation.</i>

949
01:10:32,511 --> 01:10:35,414
Who had access
to those tapes?

950
01:10:35,514 --> 01:10:36,949
We uploaded the videos
to the server.

951
01:10:37,049 --> 01:10:38,584
It could've been
hacked by anyone.

952
01:10:38,684 --> 01:10:40,920
- Fuck!
- I.T., I.T.

953
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:44,790
Yeah, how come everything I
sent you in the past four hours

954
01:10:44,890 --> 01:10:46,892
ends up on TV?
I don't know, turn it on.

955
01:10:46,992 --> 01:10:48,928
It's everywhere.

956
01:10:49,028 --> 01:10:52,198
Gary, why are you asking me this?
I'm asking you.

957
01:10:52,298 --> 01:10:53,732
It's your whole
department.

958
01:10:53,832 --> 01:10:55,834
Burquez: And he's just playing with us,

959
01:10:55,934 --> 01:11:01,574
because this whole thing
is just a big fucking game.

960
01:11:01,674 --> 01:11:04,210
(Phone rings)

961
01:11:04,310 --> 01:11:07,980
Gabe: We're the police. Okay?
We're not just idiots running around.

962
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:09,715
Check the fiber...

963
01:11:09,815 --> 01:11:11,415
Burquez.

964
01:11:11,650 --> 01:11:14,520
Man: <i>The chief wants you</i>
<i>in his office right away.</i>

965
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:15,988
(Gabe continues talking)

966
01:11:16,088 --> 01:11:17,088
Shit!

967
01:11:17,856 --> 01:11:20,226
Yeah, yeah. No.

968
01:11:20,326 --> 01:11:22,895
I'm comin' down.
I'm comin' down.

969
01:11:22,995 --> 01:11:25,346
I'm gonna
find out, man.

970
01:12:17,099 --> 01:12:19,685
It is crazy out there.

971
01:12:19,785 --> 01:12:22,021
Every channel's
showin' that video.

972
01:12:22,121 --> 01:12:24,923
Tell me
you found something.

973
01:12:25,023 --> 01:12:27,742
Um, just initial
background.

974
01:12:32,081 --> 01:12:33,999
William gentry.

975
01:12:34,099 --> 01:12:36,402
Bus driver Ben tuttle,
wasn't even his real name.

976
01:12:36,502 --> 01:12:38,904
Turns out he did three years for grand larceny.

977
01:12:39,004 --> 01:12:41,006
Tried to rob a bank
from the inside out.

978
01:12:41,106 --> 01:12:43,942
Shit. This guy went in
dressed like an armored guard.

979
01:12:44,042 --> 01:12:46,645
It was working until
the real guard showed up.

980
01:12:46,745 --> 01:12:48,580
Two people
ended up dead.

981
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:50,998
It's too bad
we saw him die.

982
01:12:52,468 --> 01:12:54,987
He was staggering around
covered in blood,

983
01:12:55,087 --> 01:12:56,637
but we don't know
he was dead.

984
01:12:59,141 --> 01:13:00,775
You think
he did it?

985
01:13:04,146 --> 01:13:05,146
What?

986
01:13:09,785 --> 01:13:11,919
Where you going?

987
01:13:16,592 --> 01:13:17,792
Flynn.

988
01:13:17,910 --> 01:13:19,812
I didn't know
you were back.

989
01:13:19,912 --> 01:13:21,580
How's our witness?

990
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:23,115
Barely said a word,

991
01:13:23,215 --> 01:13:25,984
but this kind of trauma
can really fuck your memory.

992
01:13:26,084 --> 01:13:27,619
Mind if I take a shot?

993
01:13:27,719 --> 01:13:29,519
Go ahead.

994
01:13:38,847 --> 01:13:41,700
I'm detective Reese.

995
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:43,885
How you holdin' up?

996
01:13:54,029 --> 01:13:56,931
I thought you might
like this back.

997
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:03,471
Luck of the Irish?

998
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:08,594
Mine's for luck, too.

999
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:10,863
It was
my daughter's.

1000
01:14:10,963 --> 01:14:12,363
Gracie.

1001
01:14:17,853 --> 01:14:20,788
You know, after
something like this happens,

1002
01:14:24,026 --> 01:14:27,679
they say that
things will be okay,

1003
01:14:27,779 --> 01:14:30,749
that it just
takes time,

1004
01:14:30,849 --> 01:14:33,452
and life will
go back to normal.

1005
01:14:33,552 --> 01:14:36,938
But it's not true,
ya know.

1006
01:14:38,607 --> 01:14:41,576
Things can't be normal.

1007
01:14:44,213 --> 01:14:46,080
They just
keep going.

1008
01:14:48,584 --> 01:14:50,218
Maybe that's good
enough, ya know.

1009
01:14:52,888 --> 01:14:54,088
Tyler?

1010
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:58,143
He's in the hospital.

1011
01:14:58,243 --> 01:15:01,162
The doctors are doing
the best they can.

1012
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,853
What happened to her?

1013
01:15:07,953 --> 01:15:10,238
Your daughter.

1014
01:15:12,908 --> 01:15:15,243
We were just
shoppin' at the mall.

1015
01:15:18,614 --> 01:15:21,616
She was in one of
those little play areas...

1016
01:15:22,818 --> 01:15:24,886
You know, with the slides
and the bean bags.

1017
01:15:28,123 --> 01:15:32,110
And I turned around
for a few minutes,

1018
01:15:32,210 --> 01:15:35,596
and when I looked back
in on her, she was gone.

1019
01:15:50,312 --> 01:15:53,712
Six months later,

1020
01:15:53,932 --> 01:15:57,236
they found
her little body

1021
01:15:57,336 --> 01:16:00,288
behind a truck stop
in barstow.

1022
01:16:01,924 --> 01:16:03,609
Just like that,

1023
01:16:03,709 --> 01:16:06,294
somebody changes
your life forever.

1024
01:16:09,097 --> 01:16:12,084
Did you find out
who did it?

1025
01:16:12,184 --> 01:16:12,784
No.

1026
01:16:14,052 --> 01:16:16,555
I just don't...
I don't understand

1027
01:16:16,655 --> 01:16:19,725
how someone can do
something like this

1028
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:22,127
to innocent people
like it's nothing.

1029
01:16:22,227 --> 01:16:25,964
To a serial killer,

1030
01:16:26,064 --> 01:16:28,767
murder is an art.

1031
01:16:28,867 --> 01:16:30,667
Or sport.

1032
01:16:33,055 --> 01:16:34,740
They wanna
be the best.

1033
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:37,543
It's their way
of getting attention.

1034
01:16:37,643 --> 01:16:42,180
Showing the world
what they're capable of.

1035
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:44,966
The power that they have
over life and death.

1036
01:16:47,869 --> 01:16:50,022
In their minds,

1037
01:16:50,122 --> 01:16:52,691
they're different from
the rest of us.

1038
01:16:52,791 --> 01:16:55,810
They feel like
they're gods.

1039
01:16:58,113 --> 01:17:01,900
And they never stop.

1040
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,218
And that's why
I need your help.

1041
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:06,939
You gotta try
and help me.

1042
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:09,141
I don't think I can.

1043
01:17:09,241 --> 01:17:11,241
If you can remember
something about what happened,

1044
01:17:11,076 --> 01:17:14,095
they maybe I can stop him
from hurting anyone else.

1045
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:18,584
You understand
that, right?

1046
01:17:18,684 --> 01:17:20,586
The driver, Ben.

1047
01:17:20,686 --> 01:17:23,188
Did you see him again after you
went into that last building?

1048
01:17:23,288 --> 01:17:25,591
I don't remember.

1049
01:17:25,691 --> 01:17:26,691
I don't know.

1050
01:17:26,692 --> 01:17:28,894
He was in that room.

1051
01:17:28,994 --> 01:17:30,394
The one with
the broken-down truck.

1052
01:17:30,228 --> 01:17:34,066
We just... we ran inside.

1053
01:17:34,166 --> 01:17:36,201
Me, Rachel and Ben.

1054
01:17:36,301 --> 01:17:37,301
Yeah.

1055
01:17:38,870 --> 01:17:42,274
When I turned around,
he wasn't there anymore. I tried to find him.

1056
01:17:42,374 --> 01:17:45,254
I know you did. You went down the hall, right?
You walked down the hall.

1057
01:17:45,243 --> 01:17:49,748
And you saw something
that scared you, right?

1058
01:17:49,848 --> 01:17:51,848
I saw him.

1059
01:17:51,950 --> 01:17:54,353
Yeah. Was it Ben?

1060
01:17:54,453 --> 01:17:58,123
He was wearing a mask.

1061
01:17:58,223 --> 01:18:00,158
He came after me.

1062
01:18:00,258 --> 01:18:02,027
He grabbed me.

1063
01:18:02,127 --> 01:18:03,795
And did you see
anything at all?

1064
01:18:03,895 --> 01:18:05,397
Did you see
any defining marks?

1065
01:18:05,497 --> 01:18:09,868
- I mean, it could be a scar, a tattoo.
- No.

1066
01:18:09,968 --> 01:18:12,738
And he must've hit me,
because when I woke up,

1067
01:18:12,838 --> 01:18:15,207
I didn't know where I was.
I was just in a room.

1068
01:18:15,307 --> 01:18:17,309
I could see Rachel
through a crack,

1069
01:18:17,409 --> 01:18:20,245
and she was fighting.

1070
01:18:20,345 --> 01:18:22,314
And then,
she ran outside,

1071
01:18:22,414 --> 01:18:24,349
and I saw
the welder's torch

1072
01:18:24,449 --> 01:18:27,853
banging against
all the gas tanks.

1073
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:30,822
I broke through a window,
and I crawled out,

1074
01:18:30,922 --> 01:18:33,808
and there was
an explosion.

1075
01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:37,129
I remember...

1076
01:18:37,229 --> 01:18:40,132
Steven, he was
trying to scream,

1077
01:18:40,232 --> 01:18:41,800
but he was choking.

1078
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:44,903
He just kept choking.

1079
01:18:45,003 --> 01:18:46,872
There was so much blood,

1080
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:49,307
and everything
was burning.

1081
01:18:49,407 --> 01:18:51,859
Wait a minute.
Steven was still alive?

1082
01:18:55,897 --> 01:18:58,383
Please, I just wanna go home.

1083
01:18:58,483 --> 01:18:59,883
Please.

1084
01:19:00,852 --> 01:19:02,220
I know, I know.
You should go.

1085
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:04,872
You've been through
enough.

1086
01:19:10,445 --> 01:19:12,747
We're gonna get him.

1087
01:19:27,496 --> 01:19:29,414
- Hey.
- The autopsy report.

1088
01:19:29,514 --> 01:19:31,750
I didn't finish yet.
After lunch.

1089
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:34,986
- Reese, where the hell...
- She saw him. He was alive.

1090
01:19:35,086 --> 01:19:37,489
Saw who?
What are you talking about?

1091
01:19:37,589 --> 01:19:41,109
- Are these the only bodies? - It'll take
another day or two to compile all the remains.

1092
01:19:41,092 --> 01:19:44,196
- There was a kid, about 16, brown eyes.
- Yeah, right there.

1093
01:19:44,296 --> 01:19:46,164
He put all the bodies
in the fuel house,

1094
01:19:46,264 --> 01:19:48,333
then he blew them up
or dragged them into the fire.

1095
01:19:48,433 --> 01:19:50,335
Leann was locked up,
but she managed to escape.

1096
01:19:50,435 --> 01:19:52,386
So he moved the bodies.
We know that.

1097
01:19:54,890 --> 01:19:57,175
This body should be burned
beyond all recognition,

1098
01:19:57,275 --> 01:19:59,277
but it wasn't because
he was still alive.

1099
01:19:59,377 --> 01:20:00,617
Are you saying
he tried to run?

1100
01:20:00,545 --> 01:20:02,380
Or he was trying
to hide something.

1101
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,680
- What are you guys looking for?
- What have you found?

1102
01:20:04,482 --> 01:20:07,219
A deck of cards,
pack of marlboros,

1103
01:20:07,319 --> 01:20:09,221
- some dice.
- Have you checked everywhere?

1104
01:20:09,321 --> 01:20:11,481
- I said I have not finished yet.
- What have you got?

1105
01:20:11,189 --> 01:20:13,325
- What are we looking for?
- Hold on.

1106
01:20:13,425 --> 01:20:15,225
Oh, shit.

1107
01:20:16,545 --> 01:20:18,379
I need some forceps.

1108
01:20:20,448 --> 01:20:22,528
- Communicate.
- You're gonna need some gloves, too.

1109
01:20:22,601 --> 01:20:24,836
Basic communication.

1110
01:20:24,936 --> 01:20:26,872
Four years gets me
more than this.

1111
01:20:26,972 --> 01:20:28,452
She said he was
choking on something.

1112
01:20:39,968 --> 01:20:41,168
What the hell?

1113
01:20:47,242 --> 01:20:50,878
Gabe, got the chip.
Go. It's ready.

1114
01:20:52,414 --> 01:20:55,216
Spark it up.
Gonna clean this.

1115
01:20:59,588 --> 01:21:01,422
- Okay, go.
- Yeah.

1116
01:21:03,258 --> 01:21:05,626
Go to where it cut out.

1117
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:21,447
- Go back and clean it.
- I can't. The resolution sucks.

1118
01:21:21,559 --> 01:21:23,929
- Let me...
- Yeah, yeah. Start.

1119
01:21:24,029 --> 01:21:26,380
There's something
in those glitches.

1120
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:30,484
I see four frames
I need to extract.

1121
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:36,875
- I almost got him.
- What are you doing?

1122
01:21:36,975 --> 01:21:41,929
Increasing the d.P.I. Detail
and adding a de-blur filter.

1123
01:21:47,335 --> 01:21:50,237
- That must be right when he got stabbed.
- Go to the next one.

1124
01:21:58,446 --> 01:21:59,446
Shit.

1125
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:03,350
There's another one.

1126
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:08,006
He's taking off the mask.
Come on. Come on.

1127
01:22:08,106 --> 01:22:09,423
There's one last one.

1128
01:22:14,596 --> 01:22:16,964
Come on. It's too dark.
I can't see it.

1129
01:22:24,539 --> 01:22:25,739
There!

1130
01:22:42,190 --> 01:22:43,942
The boyfriend.

1131
01:22:44,042 --> 01:22:46,002
He has a broken heart.
That's a hell of a motive.

1132
01:22:51,566 --> 01:22:53,367
We got him.

1133
01:23:05,747 --> 01:23:08,066
I would like to inform you

1134
01:23:08,166 --> 01:23:12,370
that we have just received
substantial video evidence

1135
01:23:12,470 --> 01:23:15,273
that implicates Tyler Norris
in all of these crimes.

1136
01:23:15,373 --> 01:23:18,410
It was nice
having you here today.

1137
01:23:18,510 --> 01:23:21,279
If it was just
me and burquez,

1138
01:23:21,379 --> 01:23:24,282
I would've died.

1139
01:23:24,382 --> 01:23:26,484
What are you
gonna do now?

1140
01:23:26,584 --> 01:23:29,184
I don't know.

1141
01:23:29,754 --> 01:23:32,657
Finish my leave.

1142
01:23:32,757 --> 01:23:35,209
I could use a holiday.

1143
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:50,957
Stop it.

1144
01:23:52,494 --> 01:23:53,979
Did you see something?

1145
01:23:54,079 --> 01:23:55,729
Play it again.

1146
01:23:59,367 --> 01:24:02,102
- This is Rachel's camera, right?
- Mm-hmm.

1147
01:24:03,338 --> 01:24:04,538
Again.

1148
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:09,476
The glitches, they...

1149
01:24:10,612 --> 01:24:12,246
Play it again.

1150
01:24:17,585 --> 01:24:20,038
Timecode. Again.

1151
01:24:20,138 --> 01:24:21,473
What do you see
in here?

1152
01:24:21,573 --> 01:24:23,424
Zoom in on the timecode.

1153
01:24:25,627 --> 01:24:27,361
What are you
looking at?

1154
01:24:30,698 --> 01:24:34,185
The timecode
is not breaking...

1155
01:24:34,285 --> 01:24:36,203
With the glitches.

1156
01:24:44,446 --> 01:24:49,067
Tyler Norris is currently
in custody in county hospital.

1157
01:24:49,167 --> 01:24:52,170
His condition is critical,
but we will keep you posted

1158
01:24:52,270 --> 01:24:54,072
as we get updates.

1159
01:24:54,172 --> 01:24:56,674
(Multiple cell phones
ringing)

1160
01:24:56,774 --> 01:25:01,046
I'd also like to take
a moment to mention

1161
01:25:01,146 --> 01:25:03,730
that we were able
to accomplish this...

1162
01:25:16,211 --> 01:25:18,779
They're not glitches.

1163
01:25:23,151 --> 01:25:25,319
They're edits.

1164
01:25:26,488 --> 01:25:29,088
Reese. Reese.

1165
01:25:29,274 --> 01:25:31,594
<i>Word on a new video</i>
<i>that's just hit the web.</i>

1166
01:25:30,909 --> 01:25:33,678
<i>They're outtakes</i>
<i>and deleted scenes</i>

1167
01:25:33,778 --> 01:25:36,181
<i>of some kind.</i>

1168
01:25:36,281 --> 01:25:37,682
<i>Sources are</i>
<i>still trying to...</i>

1169
01:25:37,782 --> 01:25:39,217
What the hell
is going on?

1170
01:25:39,317 --> 01:25:42,220
<i>...part of the earlier</i>
<i>released tapes.</i>

1171
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:45,190
<i>Yes, we can now confirm</i>
<i>the video is genuine,</i>

1172
01:25:45,290 --> 01:25:46,807
<i>it is real.</i>

1173
01:26:11,633 --> 01:26:14,486
- Put out an a.P.B.
- They left here hours ago.

1174
01:26:14,586 --> 01:26:16,788
- They could be anywhere.
- Jesus Christ.

1175
01:26:16,888 --> 01:26:18,890
I need an a.P.B. Out on
leann hookplat...

1176
01:26:18,990 --> 01:26:22,260
<i>Rach, you and me are gonna</i>
<i>make a movie together one day.</i>

1177
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:23,862
<i>It's gonna be</i>
<i>a masterpiece.</i>

1178
01:26:23,962 --> 01:26:26,431
I don't get this.
We saw the whole goddamn thing.

1179
01:26:26,531 --> 01:26:30,435
- How did we miss this?
- We saw what they wanted us to see.

1180
01:26:30,535 --> 01:26:32,804
Put the fuckin' camera down
and help me get this set up.

1181
01:26:32,904 --> 01:26:34,572
Yeah, just past kidwell.

1182
01:26:34,672 --> 01:26:37,191
Pay you triple,
in cash.

1183
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:42,413
You have to get more
on that one.

1184
01:26:42,513 --> 01:26:45,517
Fuck! You could ruin
everything.

1185
01:26:45,617 --> 01:26:47,467
Just get through it.

1186
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:51,070
Hey, Tyler.

1187
01:26:51,356 --> 01:26:52,524
What kind of
trick is this?

1188
01:26:52,624 --> 01:26:54,708
Trust me.
You're gonna love it.

1189
01:27:04,852 --> 01:27:06,504
Can't fix this
with editing.

1190
01:27:06,604 --> 01:27:08,989
I can fix anything
with editing.

1191
01:27:23,838 --> 01:27:25,239
Oh, you fucking bitch.

1192
01:27:29,377 --> 01:27:30,177
Ben.

1193
01:27:30,561 --> 01:27:32,764
Nope.
Still in shot.

1194
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:34,581
Make him look like
he swallowed it.

1195
01:27:36,417 --> 01:27:37,684
Shove it in there.

1196
01:27:38,953 --> 01:27:41,806
This is our little
editing suite,

1197
01:27:41,906 --> 01:27:44,242
we'll get video later
when Stacey gets out...

1198
01:27:44,342 --> 01:27:45,926
Jen. Yeah.

1199
01:27:50,732 --> 01:27:53,533
- How was it?
- Oh, man.

1200
01:28:24,866 --> 01:28:26,417
That's it.

1201
01:28:26,517 --> 01:28:27,785
Thanks for watching.

1202
01:28:27,885 --> 01:28:30,421
Remember, the next time
someone's filming you,

1203
01:28:30,521 --> 01:28:32,773
both: You could be
in the sequel.
