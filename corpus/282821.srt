Waiting for a bus there, buddy?

195
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:39,936
Seoul Station?

196
00:17:42,013 --> 00:17:44,743
What the hell... why not

197

Right on

198
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,251
Tough day, huh?

199
00:17:54,659 --> 00:17:56,957
Yeah... it blew

200
00:17:57,162 --> 00:17:59,858
This is so stupid

201
00:17:59,998 --> 00:18:02,432
This is such a waste of
time, money, energy, etc

202
00:18:03,134 --> 00:18:04,567
l mean...

203
00:18:04,969 --> 00:18:07,597
l came all the way from
Busan for this stupid training

204
00:18:07,772 --> 00:18:11,401
l mean...
l wasted nearly 2 days,

205
00:18:11,543 --> 00:18:14,569
Not to mention
the cost coming here

206
00:18:14,712 --> 00:18:18,239
What is up with this, huh?

207
00:18:18,383 --> 00:18:21,580
Of course all the politician
motherfuckers

208
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,714
had their well fed sons exempt,
so they figured

209
00:18:24,823 --> 00:18:26,848
it's okay to fuck over us
middle class people

210
00:18:27,025 --> 00:18:28,583
For those fuckers...

211
00:18:28,693 --> 00:18:30,388
reserves mean nothing
god damn it

212
00:18:31,629 --> 00:18:32,926
- Am l right or what?
- Sure

213
00:18:33,064 --> 00:18:34,156
Sure!

214
00:18:34,265 --> 00:18:36,597
Only the innocent masses
with no connections

215
00:18:36,701 --> 00:18:38,293
will rot in the army

216
00:18:38,436 --> 00:18:40,734
When they're done, they'll us

217
00:18:40,872 --> 00:18:43,067
After that, there's
the civil defense corps

So why the fuck are they
bothering us to death like this?

221
00:18:52,016 --> 00:18:53,677
<SEOUL station>

222
00:18:55,987 --> 00:18:59,980
Somebody has to stand up...

223
00:19:00,158 --> 00:19:03,321
and get things straightened out

224
00:19:04,462 --> 00:19:05,895
Dudes with power...

225
00:19:06,231 --> 00:19:09,530
they need to learn
what the hell is going on...

226
00:19:10,201 --> 00:19:12,999

00:28:13,778 --> 00:28:16,338
We were supposed to leave
the station at 8:30,

356
00:28:16,614 --> 00:28:19,208
but due to the preceding
rail car's delay, we'll now be...

357
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,978
Do we have to waste
three minutes like this?

358
00:28:22,186 --> 00:28:24,120
What? Did they just say they
were leaving 3 minutes late?

359
00:28:24,288 --> 00:28:25,619
l don't think l heard that right

360
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:27,517
Sorry... can't help you there
Well... l heard it wrong

361
00:28:27,658 --> 00:28:29,421
They always do this

362
00:28:29,827 --> 00:28:32,022
You see... they never gcare
about passengers

363
00:28:32,163 --> 00:28:35,360
Just do whatever's
convenient for themselves

364
00:28:35,499 --> 00:28:37,592
Their attitude is...
take it or leave it

365
00:28:37,735 --> 00:28:39,134
What the fuck is wrong
with people?

366
00:28:39,303 --> 00:28:41,294
The world is just upside down

367
00:28:41,505 --> 00:28:42,699
l mean... this is terrible

368
00:28:42,807 --> 00:28:44,604
You can do a lot of shit
in 3 minutes

369
00:28:44,742 --> 00:28:47,711
Why is that bitch
so damn loud?

370
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:52,843
Hold it
until the train leaves

371
00:28:53,384 --> 00:28:55,409
Once the train leaves
the platform

372
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,314
- lt's all over
- Okay

373
00:28:59,123 --> 00:29:01,148
lf l knew we were gonna get
ditched , l never would've came

374
00:29:01,392 --> 00:29:04,293
l knowl was looking forward
to having some nice sashimi

375
00:29:05,996 --> 00:29:09,056
Look at this guy
What are you doing over there?

376
00:29:09,266 --> 00:29:11,791
Why aren't you going home?

377
00:29:11,902 --> 00:29:14,871
Damn...it's him again

378
00:29:15,406 --> 00:29:16,839
- Go home shithead
- Just leave it

379
00:29:17,341 --> 00:29:18,603
Let's go home now

380
00:29:20,377 --> 00:29:22,641
- You want me to give you
300 wons? /- No

381
00:29:22,813 --> 00:29:26,214
Hey, loser! Why don't you try
asking for the lighter again

382
00:29:26,383 --> 00:29:28,044
Did good back there

383
00:29:28,419 --> 00:29:30,478
You took my lighter damn it

384
00:29:34,024 --> 00:29:36,925
Hey kid , go get a refund
on these tickets

385
00:29:37,061 --> 00:29:38,892
Hold on a sec

386
00:29:39,196 --> 00:29:41,357
Hurry up

387
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,731
Watch me, get back

388
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:47,565
Hey! Hey!

00:29:50,875 --> 00:29:52,467
Excuse me, one sec !

390
00:30:10,761 --> 00:30:14,060
We'll stop at the Youngdeungpo
station for a minute

391
00:30:14,365 --> 00:30:17,266
Have a pleasant trip Thank you

392
00:30:28,112 --> 00:30:30,410
Where's the supper?

393
00:30:30,881 --> 00:30:34,248
Bongu's not home yet

394
00:30:34,485 --> 00:30:37,750
Who cares about that bum?

395
00:30:38,422 --> 00:30:41,619
What a relief for not

396
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:43,556
having him home

397
00:30:46,096 --> 00:30:49,497
- l'm hungry
- Me too

398
00:30:50,067 --> 00:30:53,059
Just wait a little bit,
dad's coming home soon

399
00:30:53,771 --> 00:30:57,730
- Can we just start eating?
- No

400
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:01,607
l gotta work early tomorrow,
so if l don't get enough sleep,

401
00:31:01,745 --> 00:31:03,576
then it's not gonna be pretty,

402
00:31:03,781 --> 00:31:05,544
you know what l mean?

403
00:31:06,217 --> 00:31:08,014
Just take it easy

404
00:31:08,385 --> 00:31:09,909
and think of it as a harsh reality
facing our country

405
00:31:10,054 --> 00:31:12,022
What the fuck...
l never split up the two

406
00:31:12,189 --> 00:31:13,713
Did l draw the 38th parallel?

407
00:31:13,824 --> 00:31:17,658
l mean... what the fuck
is up with this?

408
00:31:17,795 --> 00:31:19,353
Speak of the 38th parallel...

409
00:31:19,496 --> 00:31:21,589
Did you ever go
to the 38th parallel?

410
00:31:21,699 --> 00:31:23,326
lf you take route
42 straight up,

411
00:31:23,467 --> 00:31:25,059
there's the 38th parallel

412
00:31:25,269 --> 00:31:27,737
You ever try the Ddukboggi

413
00:31:27,905 --> 00:31:30,669
they sell there?

414
00:31:30,808 --> 00:31:33,800
lt's really good , you know
they sell fish cakes there too

415
00:31:34,211 --> 00:31:36,543
And l think they have
sausage as well...

416
00:31:36,647 --> 00:31:39,775
But l'm thinking the sausage
is a little too hard...

417
00:31:39,984 --> 00:31:42,578
lt ain't bad at all brother
lf you ever get a chance...

418
00:31:42,686 --> 00:31:45,348
try visiting that place

419
00:31:45,522 --> 00:31:48,355
We'll be taking over
this train from this point

420
00:31:49,526 --> 00:31:51,585
Take your luggage

421
00:31:51,695 --> 00:31:54,391
and move

422
00:31:57,201 --> 00:32:01,968
Move to the coach you

423
00:32:04,541 --> 00:32:05,701

424
00:32:06,777 --> 00:32:10,042

your asses moving

425
00:32:11,048 --> 00:32:12,208

00:32:13,651 --> 00:32:14,811

430
00:32:24,561 --> 00:32:26,859
Hey, little man

431
00:32:27,965 --> 00:32:30,559
Why are you kicking
us out of our seats?

432
00:32:31,201 --> 00:32:34,068
What? Are you nuts?

433
00:32:34,872 --> 00:32:36,533

00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,972

Move!

437
00:32:46,417 --> 00:32:48,009
Why aren't you moving?

438
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:50,452
My bag !

439
00:33:07,004 --> 00:33:08,403
Let's haul ass

440
00:33:08,872 --> 00:33:10,362
l didn't know we
still had them thugs

441
00:33:10,474 --> 00:33:12,567
What are the attendants
doing?

442
00:33:12,676 --> 00:33:15,372
Take it easy
We got tons of seats here

443
00:33:15,879 --> 00:33:18,939
Seats are not our problem

444
00:33:23,253 --> 00:33:26,051
Hey, what's up?
What are you doing here?

445
00:33:26,323 --> 00:33:28,018
You got business in Busan too?

446
00:33:28,392 --> 00:33:29,586
Don't go there

447
00:33:29,693 --> 00:33:31,718
You're just
gonna get kicked out

448
00:33:38,802 --> 00:33:39,962
Let's go

449
00:33:45,609 --> 00:33:46,837
Hey!

450
00:33:49,546 --> 00:33:51,707
Crazy son of a bitch

451
00:33:52,182 --> 00:33:55,481
Why don't you just give
me back my lighter, huh?

452
00:33:58,255 --> 00:34:00,246
Man...you take care of him
and the rest... follow me

453
00:34:00,391 --> 00:34:01,756
Let's go, boys!

454
00:34:04,828 --> 00:34:07,319
Where are you going?
Stop fuckers!

455
00:34:07,564 --> 00:34:09,828
Hey, you!

456
00:34:10,534 --> 00:34:12,024
Stop!

457
00:34:12,236 --> 00:34:14,033
- You wanna follow them?
- Off of me

458
00:34:19,576 --> 00:34:22,807
The other congressmen
took the last flight

459
00:34:23,847 --> 00:34:27,442
They'll get there
a few hours early

460
00:34:27,718 --> 00:34:29,982
That's why we're
taking the train

461
00:34:31,221 --> 00:34:34,713
Who wants to spend
all night at a wake?

462
00:34:35,759 --> 00:34:38,922
lt's not even
a direct family member

463
00:34:39,163 --> 00:34:40,653
But still , he's the most
influential party member

464
00:34:40,764 --> 00:34:43,130
These things are important

465
00:34:43,367 --> 00:34:47,201
And they wonder why we never
have time to pass bills

466
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,172
How are you all doing?

467
00:34:52,309 --> 00:34:53,469
Mr. Yang !?

468
00:34:54,244 --> 00:34:57,543
Good seeing you too

469
00:34:57,714 --> 00:34:59,045
Long time no see, huh?

470
00:34:59,216 --> 00:35:01,446
First time since the election ,
right?

471
00:35:01,585 --> 00:35:02,813
What are you doing here?

472
00:35:02,986 --> 00:35:05,420
Well... l needed to speak
to the senator

473
00:35:05,589 --> 00:35:08,217
but had some trouble
getting through

474
00:35:08,425 --> 00:35:12,794
What do you need to
speak to me about?

475
00:35:15,833 --> 00:35:18,358
Okay, l see
l see where you're going

476
00:35:18,669 --> 00:35:22,002
Guess your busy schedule's
hurting your memory...

477
00:35:22,272 --> 00:35:24,172
Why don't l explain things nicely...

478
00:35:24,308 --> 00:35:26,833
l'll take it real slow

479
00:35:28,011 --> 00:35:30,673
- Mr. Yang !?
- lt's okay

480
00:35:40,257 --> 00:35:43,784
lt was about a year ago, right?

481
00:35:44,194 --> 00:35:45,491
A year ago!

482
00:35:46,363 --> 00:35:49,594
Until then... how should l put it...
YANG Chul-gon's life was...

483
00:35:52,136 --> 00:35:54,400
pretty damn fantastic

484
00:36:21,131 --> 00:36:22,894
Where are you darling?

485
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,159
l'm working right now

486
00:36:25,269 --> 00:36:28,397
- You're coming home early, right?
- Of course... for my son's birthday

487
00:36:28,505 --> 00:36:30,029
How can l not?

488
00:36:30,941 --> 00:36:34,035
l'll be home soon as soon
as l'm finished here

489
00:36:34,144 --> 00:36:39,047
- l miss you
- Okay

490
00:36:50,561 --> 00:36:55,123
lf you're a fuckin' driver,
just sit and drive, god damn it

491
00:36:55,299 --> 00:36:58,632
Don't get your
ass kicked fuckhead

492
00:36:58,769 --> 00:37:02,728
You stupid fuck

493
00:37:03,473 --> 00:37:05,202
You shit

494
00:37:21,191 --> 00:37:24,217
Right on

495
00:37:25,762 --> 00:37:29,357
You did well this time

496
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,400
You saved your country

497
00:37:35,005 --> 00:37:38,998
Decided to run
for the election

498
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:43,644
- Sure
- Politics can be tricky

499
00:37:45,215 --> 00:37:47,843
sometimes
lf your opponent uses force,

500
00:37:48,318 --> 00:37:52,084
You don't have a choice
but to resist using force

501
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:54,785
Yes, sure!

502
00:37:55,192 --> 00:37:57,558
lf l win the election ,

503
00:37:59,162 --> 00:38:02,928
l'll guarantee
a little something for you

504
00:38:06,069 --> 00:38:08,333
What do you mean
a little something?

505
00:38:09,339 --> 00:38:11,170
Whatever you want

506
00:38:11,975 --> 00:38:14,034
You wanna get
involved in politics?

507
00:38:14,544 --> 00:38:15,943
l'll give you politics

508
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:20,672
Politics... me?
Politics?

509
00:38:37,534 --> 00:38:40,662
Man... things were looking
bright until

510
00:38:41,872 --> 00:38:45,569
then... but you turned
your back on me

511
00:38:46,877 --> 00:38:48,174
When l called your office,

512
00:38:48,312 --> 00:38:51,247
that bitch secretary would tell me
you're busy

513
00:38:51,748 --> 00:38:53,682
And when l visited
your office,

514
00:38:53,984 --> 00:38:57,112
that fuckin' guard
That fuckin' guard... shit

515
00:38:57,721 --> 00:38:59,621
won't let me in

516
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:04,927
l mean... for me
to get on this train...

517
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:08,158
you must've pissed
me off big time

518
00:39:08,265 --> 00:39:10,733
l'm really not asking you
for much

519
00:39:10,867 --> 00:39:13,062
Our boys worked hard
for a year

520
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:14,737
So just give me enough money
to feed these poor bastards food

521
00:39:16,306 --> 00:39:21,073
You're a politician
You should keep your word

522
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,974
Are you out of your mind?

523
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:33,656
Are you threatening me you
crazy trash son of a gun?

524
00:39:33,957 --> 00:39:38,121
l think you're losing it

525
00:39:38,595 --> 00:39:41,689
Did you just say trash?

526
00:39:42,265 --> 00:39:44,699
Fuckin' A...

527
00:39:45,068 --> 00:39:47,298
l'm trying to be polite here...
but you're not helping me

528
00:39:47,404 --> 00:39:49,736
What are you doing?

529
00:39:49,873 --> 00:39:52,239
- Get rid of these guys
- Boys!

530
00:39:52,376 --> 00:39:54,640
What the fuck?
You cocksuckers!

531
00:40:10,093 --> 00:40:12,459
What are you lookin' at?

532
00:40:12,729 --> 00:40:15,789
You wanna die motherfucker?

556
00:41:32,709 --> 00:41:34,506

558
00:41:38,582 --> 00:41:43,417
Yong-gap
You're dead meat today

559
00:41:43,854 --> 00:41:46,789
l told the guys to carry
gas guns just in case

560
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:49,183
a scene breaks out

561
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:52,522
l'm in no mood to create a
scene here, so just call the cops

562
00:42:24,394 --> 00:42:26,259

Where did all the attendants go?

567
00:42:50,387 --> 00:42:53,220
You see... fuckers!

568
00:42:53,356 --> 00:42:55,688
They don't give a fuck
about passenger safety

569
00:42:55,825 --> 00:42:57,884
l'm sorry...

570
00:42:58,228 --> 00:43:01,664

00:43:01,865 --> 00:43:04,732
- What?

572
00:43:04,901 --> 00:43:07,267
Did you rent

Are you nuts? l'm having enough
trouble renting my own home

574
00:43:11,608 --> 00:43:13,439
Don't worry

576
00:43:17,314 --> 00:43:19,248
People could actually die using
guns

577
00:43:19,549 --> 00:43:22,950
We'll just use our manpower

578
00:43:23,186 --> 00:43:25,950
Boss, you think Man-soo
will come and help us out?

579
00:43:26,056 --> 00:43:27,956

- Why? For what?
- Cause it's mine!

593
00:44:38,428 --> 00:44:42,364
- Motherfucker!

00:44:58,515 --> 00:45:03,248
ls it you? You?... Or you?

597
00:45:05,055 --> 00:45:06,818
They just sort of went

598
00:45:06,956 --> 00:45:08,287
Leave it

599
00:45:09,526 --> 00:45:12,723
We don't have time

600
00:45:13,096 --> 00:45:16,156

Throw him out

00:45:38,054 --> 00:45:40,420
Can you just give
me back my lighter?

607
00:45:40,557 --> 00:45:44,152

608
00:45:44,661 --> 00:45:47,528
- Why can't you talk?

609
00:45:47,831 --> 00:45:52,734
What do you mean why?

610
00:45:52,836 --> 00:45:55,202

616
00:46:18,461 --> 00:46:21,726
- Your wife?
- None of your business fuckface!

617
00:46:22,098 --> 00:46:24,225
Next stop is Chunahn

618
00:46:24,467 --> 00:46:27,959
- Get ready
- Okay

619
00:46:29,172 --> 00:46:34,109
YANG Chul-gon... you want

620
00:46:34,477 --> 00:46:37,037
Eat your food and wait

621

Want a drink?

622
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:51,659
Excuse me?

00:47:25,461 --> 00:47:29,397
Listen to me and

624
00:47:30,233 --> 00:47:33,828
l said... can't do it

625
00:47:34,204 --> 00:47:38,504
l can't Chul-gon and l shed
blood together We're like brothers

626
00:47:38,842 --> 00:47:41,538
What are you fuckin' vampires?

627
00:47:42,145 --> 00:47:46,548
And why share blood with
a low-life like Chul-gon?

628
00:47:46,716 --> 00:47:52,177
How would l have known this
was ever going to happen?

629
00:47:52,422 --> 00:47:55,118
Jesus... lord...

630
00:47:55,758 --> 00:47:58,591
Jesus... just shut up
and go back

631
00:47:58,761 --> 00:48:02,094
l said l can't do that

632
00:48:02,298 --> 00:48:04,823
You're putting me in a rather
difficult position here

633
00:48:05,001 --> 00:48:08,198
Seems like there's
not much we can do

634
00:48:08,538 --> 00:48:11,439
- Man...
- Christ

635
00:48:15,311 --> 00:48:19,270
The amount they're
asking for isn't that much

636
00:48:19,515 --> 00:48:21,608
Why don't we just give it
to them?

637
00:48:21,818 --> 00:48:23,877
Use your head

638
00:48:24,487 --> 00:48:27,012
lf we pay'em ,

639
00:48:27,423 --> 00:48:31,757
we're admitting to
hiring gangsters for the campaign

640
00:48:32,562 --> 00:48:37,932
lf we don't pay'em , we can just
say that they followed us around

641
00:48:41,437 --> 00:48:43,564
What the hell is that?

642
00:49:04,928 --> 00:49:06,122
Hey, Chul-gon !

643
00:49:06,262 --> 00:49:09,891
Oh yeah , Man-soo
long time no see

644
00:49:10,066 --> 00:49:12,660

so l called all of my boys
and put'em in

646
00:49:17,774 --> 00:49:19,605
What the hell is going on here?

647
00:49:19,842 --> 00:49:24,074
We received an order
and came right away

648
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:28,148
Chul-gon sure did
call a whole lot of backup

649
00:49:28,384 --> 00:49:30,978
You saw them , right?

650
00:49:31,187 --> 00:49:34,748

whole lot of cops

651
00:49:34,924 --> 00:49:37,256

l'm just sorry that
l can't be of much help

655
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:54,333
lt's okay bro Man , this
ain't nothing to cry over

656
00:49:54,777 --> 00:49:56,472
You crooked cop motherfucker!

657

886
01:07:31,099 --> 01:07:34,330
Kyung-bu line's trains,
make a detour immediately

887
01:07:34,436 --> 01:07:36,427
Get off the rail right now!

888
01:07:36,571 --> 01:07:38,266
Sending in the rangers to a train

889
01:07:38,407 --> 01:07:40,671
that's traveling at 140km/h
is way too risky

890
01:07:40,809 --> 01:07:42,936
- Can't even get close to...
- lf we blow up the link between

891
01:07:43,111 --> 01:07:45,136
the engine car and coach ,
the train might derail

892
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:47,407
Considering the speed of
the train

893
01:07:47,549 --> 01:07:50,712
using a sniper is
again not realistic

894
01:07:51,219 --> 01:07:55,053
Well then find a way!

895
01:07:59,094 --> 01:08:03,030
What? Oh yeah?

896
01:08:07,502 --> 01:08:08,560
Hmmm...

897
01:08:10,172 --> 01:08:12,902
Right on

898
01:08:17,345 --> 01:08:20,041
The police soccer tournament

899
01:08:20,315 --> 01:08:23,284
has been postponed they say

900
01:08:24,786 --> 01:08:26,515
What's wrong with you?

901
01:08:26,855 --> 01:08:31,258
ls that important right now?
Wake the fuck up!

902
01:08:36,231 --> 01:08:38,199
Captain...

903
01:08:40,936 --> 01:08:42,801
We can't just get
fucked over like this

904
01:08:42,971 --> 01:08:45,804
Let's show'em what we got

905
01:08:45,941 --> 01:08:47,966
Let's do it!
Come on now...

906
01:08:52,214 --> 01:08:56,378
Hold on a second
Just one second... wait

907
01:08:56,551 --> 01:08:58,815
What? Why wait?

908
01:08:58,954 --> 01:09:02,890
We should calm down and carefully
think over what we're about to do

909
01:09:03,024 --> 01:09:07,427
Shit happens sometimes so

910
01:09:07,696 --> 01:09:11,860
maybe it's best if we just wait

911
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:16,236
Shut the fuck up Let's go!

912
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:33,913
What the...

913
01:09:34,089 --> 01:09:35,920
- Open the door
- Open it

914
01:09:36,458 --> 01:09:38,653
- Open the door
- Hey, open the door!

915
01:09:40,362 --> 01:09:44,731
Boss, that crazy son of a bitch
brought hundreds of people

916
01:09:45,667 --> 01:09:48,693
What about our boys?

917
01:09:48,837 --> 01:09:50,964
Talk to me shithead !

918
01:09:51,106 --> 01:09:53,939
l told you it'd be better
if we took all our boys

919
01:09:54,042 --> 01:09:57,205
Things getting tough
around here?

920
01:09:57,345 --> 01:10:00,974
Shut up
Hey Chul-gon ,

921
01:10:01,416 --> 01:10:03,247
when masses rebel ,

922
01:10:03,351 --> 01:10:04,978
that means the game's over

923
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:07,520
- The power of the me masses...
- Just shut the fuck up

924
01:10:07,622 --> 01:10:08,611
before l rip your stupid mouth

925
01:10:08,790 --> 01:10:13,693
- Motherfucker!
- How dare you...

926
01:10:17,532 --> 01:10:19,864
l said , shut up

927
01:10:20,001 --> 01:10:22,026
Hey, Chul-gon...

928
01:10:22,170 --> 01:10:24,832
it's a bad habit

929
01:10:24,940 --> 01:10:27,272
You understand , right?

930
01:10:27,375 --> 01:10:30,105
Open the god damn door

931
01:10:31,846 --> 01:10:34,076
Move

932
01:10:34,182 --> 01:10:36,480
Why?

933
01:10:36,585 --> 01:10:38,450
Hey, hey, out of my way
Open the door you thugs!

934
01:10:38,620 --> 01:10:41,054
lf you don't open it,
we'll open it

935
01:10:41,156 --> 01:10:44,990
lf the door's locked from the inside,
it won't open from the outside

936
01:10:45,093 --> 01:10:47,391
- What do we do now... fuck...
- Just moment!

937
01:10:47,495 --> 01:10:49,224
l think l've found a way

938
01:10:49,364 --> 01:10:51,855
ln this movie l saw, the star
somehow got on the roof and then...

939
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,969
he crawled to the engine room

940
01:10:55,070 --> 01:10:56,833
and broke the window
and entered

941
01:10:56,938 --> 01:10:59,236
You're right...
Under fuckin' Seas

942
01:10:59,608 --> 01:11:01,439
lt's Under Siege

943
01:11:02,310 --> 01:11:04,039
Who cares about that now?

944
01:11:04,179 --> 01:11:06,704
Who's gonna go up there?

945
01:11:06,815 --> 01:11:09,943
Who's gonna go up there?

946
01:11:10,318 --> 01:11:12,445
Ah , you!

950
01:11:54,195 --> 01:11:55,753

953
01:12:57,826 --> 01:13:00,056
l said you won't
see a penny from me

954
01:13:00,228 --> 01:13:02,389
Do you really wanna die?

955
01:13:02,497 --> 01:13:04,124
Kill me you fuck!
Kill me!

956
01:13:04,265 --> 01:13:06,790
You're not getting my money

member of the rangers

Loser for life

01:15:50,131 --> 01:15:52,531
