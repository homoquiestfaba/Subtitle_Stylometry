8
00:02:21,052 --> 00:02:23,850
She's still talking,
but now she's got her mum on the line.

9
00:02:23,932 --> 00:02:25,923

23
00:03:01,332 --> 00:03:02,321
No more?

24
00:03:03,332 --> 00:03:04,481
All through.

25
00:03:04,772 --> 00:03:07,411
All done. And.... Yes! Thank you, sir.

26
00:03:07,612 --> 00:03:10,968
New bidder. Gentleman
on the left of the aisle, $24,000.

27
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:13,328
Not really. It's a crueljoke.

28
00:03:13,932 --> 00:03:16,002
Sold to you, sir, for $23,000...

29
00:03:16,212 --> 00:03:18,806

Right.

33
00:03:32,452 --> 00:03:34,408
This is very embarrassing.

34
00:03:34,652 --> 00:03:38,167
It now turns out that lots 85
through to the end ofyour catalog...

35
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:41,528
...are, in fact, not actually here.
Delivery problem.

36
00:03:41,692 --> 00:03:45,446
If it's any consolation,
we feel as stupid as I'm sure we look.

37
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:47,171
Thank you very much.

38
00:03:48,332 --> 00:03:49,845
This is pathetic!

39
00:03:50,652 --> 00:03:53,007
It's a nightmare. We're a laughingstock.

40
00:03:53,092 --> 00:03:54,810
-They just showed up.
-The trucks?

41
00:03:54,892 --> 00:03:58,089
Just in time for the end of the auction.
Remind me to thank them.

42
00:03:58,172 --> 00:04:00,242
Helen, everything's fixed for tonight?

43
00:04:00,332 --> 00:04:03,085
Great. The reservation, flowers,
all that stuff?

44
00:04:03,252 --> 00:04:04,321
All taken care of.

45
00:04:04,412 --> 00:04:06,926
Brilliant. Thank you so much. Thanks.

46
00:04:07,972 --> 00:04:12,250
Listen, you don't think
three months is too soon, do you?

47
00:04:12,492 --> 00:04:15,928
I haven't even met her family yet.
What do you think, as a woman?

48
00:04:16,012 --> 00:04:18,572
As a woman? Very risky.

49
00:04:18,812 --> 00:04:22,691
Right. Well, thanks.
That's made me feel a lot better.

50
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:28,566
You've brought me just under
half the paintings just over...

51
00:04:28,732 --> 00:04:31,371
...two weeks late
for the fifth time this year.

52
00:04:31,652 --> 00:04:34,041
You gonna sign or do I take it all back?

53
00:04:34,172 --> 00:04:36,766
That's it, is it?
That's your response to this?

54
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:40,643
All right, guys, load it up.

55
00:04:40,892 --> 00:04:42,803
I'll sign. Lovely.

56
00:04:43,052 --> 00:04:45,407
Thank you so much.
You've been a huge help.

57
00:04:45,492 --> 00:04:47,608
Note: Call Better Business Bureau.

58
00:04:49,132 --> 00:04:51,248
Other note: Seek lost testicles.

59
00:04:51,452 --> 00:04:53,761
Michael? Need a lift?

60
00:04:54,332 --> 00:04:57,563
That's nice of you.
I'm actually picking up Gina from school.

61
00:04:57,652 --> 00:05:00,212
That's fine. We're going that way. Hop in.

62
00:05:00,652 --> 00:05:03,450
Do you know Mr. Morganson?
Michael Felgate.

63
00:05:03,932 --> 00:05:05,923
Very nice to meet you.
We're very excited...

64
00:05:06,012 --> 00:05:09,527
...that you might be thinking of us
for your father's collection.

65
00:05:10,172 --> 00:05:12,242
Mr. Morganson was at today's sale.

66
00:05:14,292 --> 00:05:16,567
Well, not typical, if I may say so.

67
00:05:16,852 --> 00:05:20,606
I think every auction house in New York
has these delivery hiccups.

68
00:05:21,092 --> 00:05:23,242
Sotheby's doesn't seem to.

69
00:05:25,932 --> 00:05:27,047
Right.

70
00:05:36,652 --> 00:05:39,485
I heard about tonight. Best of luck.

71
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:40,966
Thanks.

72
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,765
Go, girl!

73
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:20,642
So? Where are we going?

74
00:06:20,852 --> 00:06:23,605
I am unable to tell you,
but it's somewhere very special.

75
00:06:23,692 --> 00:06:25,011
Goodbye!

76
00:06:26,012 --> 00:06:27,047
'Bye, Miss Vitale!

77
00:06:27,132 --> 00:06:28,645
And we're late. Run!

78
00:06:38,812 --> 00:06:40,530
Please don't!

79
00:06:42,332 --> 00:06:44,243
What? Don't what?

80
00:06:44,732 --> 00:06:46,211
Just stop.

81
00:06:47,292 --> 00:06:50,364
Just stop. Otherwise, I can't go on.
Just run normally.

82
00:06:52,892 --> 00:06:54,450
I am running normally.

83
00:06:56,812 --> 00:06:59,565
Right, I'm sorry. I thought, you know....

84
00:06:59,772 --> 00:07:03,651
I haven't seen you run before,
and I thought you were doing a funny run.

85
00:07:04,092 --> 00:07:07,209
A funny run? That's my run.

86
00:07:09,132 --> 00:07:10,451
What time is it?

87
00:07:12,172 --> 00:07:14,527
We're now 25 minutes late.

88
00:07:14,732 --> 00:07:16,962
We've lost our reservation.
What do you think?

89
00:07:17,052 --> 00:07:19,691
I can't think. I'm much
too hurt about my run.

90
00:07:19,892 --> 00:07:22,645
We'll go somewhere else. And let's walk.

91
00:07:25,852 --> 00:07:26,807
Thanks.

92
00:07:30,972 --> 00:07:32,166
Are you okay?

93
00:07:32,812 --> 00:07:35,121
-You look a little fishy.
-No, I'm fine.

94
00:07:37,052 --> 00:07:38,485
How was last night?

95
00:07:38,812 --> 00:07:40,165
Fine. The usual.

96
00:07:40,572 --> 00:07:41,766
Your dad okay?

97
00:07:42,732 --> 00:07:43,847
He's great.

98
00:07:46,012 --> 00:07:50,210
I'm sorry. I want you to meet him
and Ritchie. It's just--

99
00:07:50,412 --> 00:07:53,882
You're ashamed of me. I talk funny.
My hair's unusually fluffy.

100
00:07:53,972 --> 00:07:55,371
Just give me time.

101
00:07:55,732 --> 00:07:59,361
Tell me what his restaurant's called
so I can sneak in, in a beard.

102
00:08:00,732 --> 00:08:02,688
It's called The La Trattoria.

103
00:08:03,452 --> 00:08:05,124
You mean La Trattoria.

104
00:08:06,132 --> 00:08:07,087
No.

105
00:08:08,172 --> 00:08:10,640
The La Trattoria means
"The The Trattoria."

106
00:08:10,812 --> 00:08:12,040
I know.

107
00:08:12,732 --> 00:08:14,165
Interesting.

108
00:08:15,532 --> 00:08:19,445
Look, I've gotta go to the la bathroom
and I'll be back in a sec.

109
00:08:29,772 --> 00:08:30,761
Hi.

110
00:08:31,492 --> 00:08:35,167
I was wondering if you could help me out
with a special arrangement.

111
00:08:36,572 --> 00:08:40,850
I've got this fortune, and I wondered
if you could stick it in a fortune cookie.

112
00:08:41,732 --> 00:08:42,801
Thank you.

113
00:08:43,452 --> 00:08:45,044
Welcome!

114
00:08:46,812 --> 00:08:47,881
Thanks.

115
00:08:48,572 --> 00:08:50,528
-Thank you.
-Welcome!

116
00:08:54,572 --> 00:08:55,891
She wants you to pay now.

117
00:08:55,972 --> 00:08:59,123
No! You eat cookie.

118
00:09:03,812 --> 00:09:06,042
Looks like we better eat our cookies.

119
00:09:11,212 --> 00:09:12,850
"You like Chinese food."

120
00:09:12,932 --> 00:09:14,126
That's spooky.

121
00:09:14,812 --> 00:09:16,165
You gonna check yours?

122
00:09:16,252 --> 00:09:18,482
No, I'm gonna save it for later.

123
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:19,920
Eat cookie.

124
00:09:20,132 --> 00:09:22,566
-She will when she's ready.
-No, you have it.

125
00:09:22,652 --> 00:09:24,085
No, you eat cookie.

126
00:09:25,132 --> 00:09:26,451
I don't want to.

127
00:09:30,932 --> 00:09:32,604
-Eat cookie.
-I'm not hungry!

128
00:09:32,692 --> 00:09:34,284
The best thing is to play along.

129
00:09:34,372 --> 00:09:36,010
I won't take orders from a waitress.

130
00:09:36,092 --> 00:09:38,560
Not waitress! Owner! Eat fucking cookie!

131
00:09:38,652 --> 00:09:39,880
This woman is insane.

132
00:09:39,972 --> 00:09:41,166
Gina, do you love me?

133
00:09:41,292 --> 00:09:42,042
Yeah.

134
00:09:42,172 --> 00:09:43,446
-Do you trust me?
-Yeah.

135
00:09:43,972 --> 00:09:45,451
Then, eat the cookie.

136
00:09:56,772 --> 00:09:59,127
"Good fences make good neighbors."

137
00:09:59,772 --> 00:10:01,285
Oh, my God! Jeffrey!

138
00:10:03,132 --> 00:10:05,521
The answer is yes! Oh, my God!

139
00:10:05,692 --> 00:10:06,920
Honey, I can't--

140
00:10:07,012 --> 00:10:09,207
-Excuse me.
-What are you talking about?

141
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:12,443
I am so sorry. There's been a mistake.
That's actually your one.

142
00:10:12,532 --> 00:10:14,284
It's quite true too.

143
00:10:16,132 --> 00:10:18,282
This is what you're meant to have.

144
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:21,326
And...

145
00:10:21,732 --> 00:10:22,801
...this.

146
00:10:26,812 --> 00:10:28,006
Oh, my God....

147
00:10:29,652 --> 00:10:30,721
Two karat.

148
00:10:30,812 --> 00:10:32,325
How much money? What you pay?

149
00:10:32,412 --> 00:10:35,051
We could really use some privacy here.
Thanks.

150
00:10:35,932 --> 00:10:37,251
Just give us a moment.

151
00:10:37,332 --> 00:10:39,607
-I'm not waitress. Owner. My restaurant!
-I know!

152
00:10:39,692 --> 00:10:40,966
Go away!

153
00:10:46,132 --> 00:10:47,611
Michael! My God!

154
00:10:50,812 --> 00:10:52,484
I don't know what to say.

155
00:10:52,572 --> 00:10:55,086
I thought what she said was pretty good.

156
00:10:56,132 --> 00:10:58,771
Obviously, you could leave out
the Jeffrey bit.

157
00:11:01,612 --> 00:11:03,250
I can't. I'm sorry.

158
00:11:14,212 --> 00:11:15,930
I'm so sorry.

159
00:11:16,372 --> 00:11:17,600
It was just....

160
00:11:38,172 --> 00:11:41,130
Hi, Jimmy. Listen,
did Gina just come back?

161
00:11:41,332 --> 00:11:43,721
She came back, all right,
crying her eyes out.

162
00:11:43,812 --> 00:11:47,771
She packed a bag, ran back out again.
What the hell you been doing to her?

163
00:11:51,012 --> 00:11:52,445
I asked her to marry me.

164
00:11:52,532 --> 00:11:53,521
No!

165
00:11:53,892 --> 00:11:55,689
Are you kidding me?

166
00:11:59,772 --> 00:12:01,842
Come here, you. This is great!

167
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,890
She didn't, by any chance,
say where she was going?

168
00:12:05,252 --> 00:12:06,605
She went to her dad's house.

169
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:08,808
You don't have that address
by any chance?

170
00:12:08,892 --> 00:12:10,689
No, I don't. But you could ask him.

171
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:13,889
He's got a restaurant right around
the block. Corner of Mulberry.

172
00:12:13,972 --> 00:12:15,803
Right, The La Trattoria.

173
00:12:16,212 --> 00:12:17,440
That's the one.

174
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:20,166
You dog, you.

175
00:12:20,732 --> 00:12:23,326
I am a bit of a dog.
Thanks so much, Jimmy.

176
00:12:24,572 --> 00:12:26,244
Hey, all the best!

177
00:12:34,772 --> 00:12:37,047
Hi, it's Jimmy. Is Mr. Vitale in?

178
00:12:37,212 --> 00:12:40,284
-You want Frank?
-I got some great news for him.

179
00:13:14,332 --> 00:13:17,369
Excuse me. I was hoping
you might be able to tell me--

180
00:13:17,492 --> 00:13:18,971
You're Michael.

181
00:13:20,212 --> 00:13:21,361
I'm Ritchie.

182
00:13:21,492 --> 00:13:22,607
Right!

183
00:13:24,332 --> 00:13:25,685
Great to meet you.

184
00:13:25,892 --> 00:13:27,610
You look a lot like Gina.

185
00:13:28,092 --> 00:13:30,048
You don't look like her at all.

186
00:13:30,812 --> 00:13:32,245
I'll go get my dad.

187
00:13:32,452 --> 00:13:33,965
No, that's okay.

188
00:13:34,172 --> 00:13:36,322
I just needed his home address.

189
00:13:40,372 --> 00:13:41,771
You're Gina's guy.

190
00:13:42,172 --> 00:13:43,127
Right.

191
00:13:43,772 --> 00:13:45,649
You own that auction house.

192
00:13:45,852 --> 00:13:47,843
No, I just run it for the owner.

193
00:13:49,212 --> 00:13:51,089
Interesting line of business.

194
00:13:51,612 --> 00:13:54,763
What's the deal with that?
You get to pick the paintings?

195
00:13:55,212 --> 00:13:58,204
I used to. Now I just pick fights
with truck drivers.

196
00:13:59,292 --> 00:14:01,283
-Delivery problems?
-Right, yeah.

197
00:14:01,572 --> 00:14:03,802
You know, I love art.

198
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:07,850
What's that supposed to mean?

199
00:14:07,932 --> 00:14:09,331
Johnny, it don't mean nothing.

200
00:14:09,412 --> 00:14:10,891
-Vinnie.
-What'd I say?

201
00:14:10,972 --> 00:14:14,567
You know what you said.
You like the guy? You find him attractive?

202
00:14:14,652 --> 00:14:16,085
Chrissakes, Johnny!

203
00:14:16,292 --> 00:14:19,011
-Something's going on here!
-Nothing's going on!

204
00:14:32,132 --> 00:14:35,010
I apologize. My son is very emotional.

205
00:14:36,732 --> 00:14:37,926
Artistic.

206
00:14:38,652 --> 00:14:40,290
I think you understand.

207
00:14:41,332 --> 00:14:42,447
Absolutely.

208
00:14:44,012 --> 00:14:45,809
I hate to disturb Mr. Vitale.

209
00:14:45,892 --> 00:14:48,645
I was just wondering,
does anyone have his home--

210
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,087
Mr. Vitale.

211
00:14:51,212 --> 00:14:53,885
My God! Michael, finally.

212
00:14:54,292 --> 00:14:57,170
You know, Gina keeps telling me
how busy you are...

213
00:14:57,732 --> 00:14:59,290
...but better late than never.

214
00:14:59,372 --> 00:15:00,771
-Right?
-Right.

215
00:15:00,932 --> 00:15:03,207
-So did you meet everyone?
-I think so.

216
00:15:03,412 --> 00:15:04,322
Vinnie.

217
00:15:04,412 --> 00:15:05,686
Carmine. Louie.

218
00:15:06,052 --> 00:15:07,201
That is Uncle Vito.

219
00:15:07,292 --> 00:15:08,805
-A pleasure.
-Likewise.

220
00:15:08,892 --> 00:15:11,486
So, right.... Are you mostly family, then?

221
00:15:14,852 --> 00:15:15,921
Mostly.

222
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:20,131
You two should talk.

223
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:21,201
Right.

224
00:15:22,652 --> 00:15:24,768
Good luck with them trucks.

225
00:15:24,972 --> 00:15:27,930
Thanks. Mr. Vitale,
it's really nice to meet you at last.

226
00:15:28,012 --> 00:15:30,401
I just dropped by to ask you a question.

227
00:15:30,492 --> 00:15:35,202
Is that right, a question? I have an idea
what that question might be.

228
00:15:35,492 --> 00:15:36,402
You do?

229
00:15:36,492 --> 00:15:40,644
But, if we're gonna do this right,
shouldn't we get to know each other first?

230
00:15:41,452 --> 00:15:42,407
Yeah.

231
00:15:42,572 --> 00:15:44,244
-Of course.
-I suppose so.

232
00:15:46,092 --> 00:15:48,003
You know something, Michael...

233
00:15:48,892 --> 00:15:50,803
...l think I'm gonna like you.

234
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,767
I believe very deeply in first impressions.

235
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:57,640
I fell in love with my wife at first sight.
And the minute they showed...

236
00:15:57,732 --> 00:16:02,123
...that Charles Manson on the news,
I said, "l know this guy's up to no good."

237
00:16:03,292 --> 00:16:07,763
Now I see you for the first time
and I know you love my daughter.

238
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:11,282
Look, Mr. Vitale, here's the thing--

239
00:16:11,492 --> 00:16:12,561
Frank.

240
00:16:13,492 --> 00:16:15,050
I wanna show you something.

241
00:16:15,132 --> 00:16:18,010
For chrissakes, Ritchie,
I can't hear myself think!

242
00:16:18,452 --> 00:16:19,805
What's wrong with you?

243
00:16:19,892 --> 00:16:21,450
I don't know!

244
00:16:25,532 --> 00:16:28,569
The kid's got a 174 IQ,
and what do you get? An idiot.

245
00:16:28,852 --> 00:16:31,571
I mean, he's my son and I love him.

246
00:16:32,252 --> 00:16:34,891
And I wish there was another word.
There isn't.

247
00:16:35,012 --> 00:16:37,321
Mr. Vitale, do you have a bathroom?

248
00:16:37,532 --> 00:16:41,241
Down the hall. You can't miss it.
Come upstairs when you're through.

249
00:17:24,572 --> 00:17:26,051
Take a look at this.

250
00:17:29,692 --> 00:17:31,410
There's a man in the freezer.

251
00:17:31,492 --> 00:17:33,210
I know. Maintenance.

252
00:17:34,492 --> 00:17:36,562
Come here, come here. Come here!

253
00:17:37,772 --> 00:17:40,411
You recognize this person?

254
00:17:40,812 --> 00:17:44,088
The best student they ever had.
Here she is with her mother.

255
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:48,968
Gina has her eyes, you'll notice.

256
00:17:49,052 --> 00:17:52,408
About a week after this day,
her mother passed away.

257
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:56,724
A week after that, Gina was back in school,
studying harder than before...

258
00:17:57,532 --> 00:18:01,366
...coming home every night,
trying to take care of me and Ritchie.

259
00:18:02,812 --> 00:18:04,404
She's still doing it.

260
00:18:04,732 --> 00:18:06,324
I apologize.

261
00:18:10,012 --> 00:18:13,004
But as you may have guessed...

262
00:18:13,812 --> 00:18:15,370
...l am crazy about my Gina.

263
00:18:15,452 --> 00:18:17,568
My God, I am so thrilled...

264
00:18:17,772 --> 00:18:21,447
...she met someone who knows
exactly how she deserves to be treated.

265
00:18:21,732 --> 00:18:22,642
Right.

266
00:18:22,732 --> 00:18:24,324
Like a fucking princess.

267
00:18:25,812 --> 00:18:30,124
Mr. Vitale, I think I should really tell you
about what happened tonight.

268
00:18:32,892 --> 00:18:36,089
I got a confession to make.
I already know.

269
00:18:36,652 --> 00:18:39,120
-You do?
-Well, her doorman called me.

270
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:45,168
When he called with the good news,
I knew this Michael, he's a gentleman.

271
00:18:45,372 --> 00:18:47,840
He's coming to ask for my daughter's hand.

272
00:18:49,932 --> 00:18:51,160
Go ahead.

273
00:18:58,252 --> 00:18:59,446
May l...

274
00:19:00,252 --> 00:19:03,483
...please have your daughter's hand
in marriage...

275
00:19:04,572 --> 00:19:05,846
...Mr. Vitale?

276
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,046
Frank?

277
00:19:12,372 --> 00:19:13,361
Dad.

278
00:19:13,732 --> 00:19:14,721
Yes.

279
00:19:15,812 --> 00:19:17,211
What a kid.

280
00:19:33,292 --> 00:19:35,123
I'm sleeping, Daddy.

281
00:19:38,012 --> 00:19:39,001
It's me.

282
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:48,890
I love you so much.

283
00:19:49,572 --> 00:19:51,164
Well, I love you.

284
00:19:51,452 --> 00:19:53,522
Then why did you have to do this?

285
00:19:54,732 --> 00:19:57,166
Everything was perfect.
Why did you have to ruin it?

286
00:19:57,452 --> 00:19:59,124
I didn't mean to.

287
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,160
I just thought--

288
00:20:01,252 --> 00:20:03,482
I know! And I do!

289
00:20:03,892 --> 00:20:06,167
I do so much!

290
00:20:06,812 --> 00:20:08,131
Well, that's great.

291
00:20:08,212 --> 00:20:10,362
That's fantastic.

292
00:20:10,572 --> 00:20:12,608
But I can't! l....

293
00:20:13,372 --> 00:20:14,487
I just can't!

294
00:20:14,572 --> 00:20:16,290
Gina, I'm not following.

295
00:20:18,652 --> 00:20:21,803
-What's happening?
-I can't talk about this in the house.

296
00:20:23,132 --> 00:20:24,804
So where are we going?

297
00:20:25,412 --> 00:20:26,208
Out.

298
00:20:27,252 --> 00:20:29,402
Right. Nowhere too dressy, I hope.

299
00:20:40,732 --> 00:20:43,292
I can't marry you, because of my father.

300
00:20:44,532 --> 00:20:45,681
Your father?

301
00:20:48,612 --> 00:20:50,330
I just met your father.

302
00:20:51,012 --> 00:20:52,240
I loved him.

303
00:20:53,212 --> 00:20:57,046
Well, I needed this address,
so I went to The The Trattoria.

304
00:20:57,252 --> 00:20:59,129
I met some of your relations.

305
00:21:00,852 --> 00:21:02,331
Keep walking.

306
00:21:04,052 --> 00:21:07,283
So who'd you meet? Nice Uncle Vito?

307
00:21:07,772 --> 00:21:10,809
Full name: Vito Graziosi.
That ring any bells?

308
00:21:11,452 --> 00:21:12,726
Was it boxing?

309
00:21:12,932 --> 00:21:17,050
Vito "The Butcher" Graziosi.
He's the head of the Graziosi crime family.

310
00:21:17,252 --> 00:21:18,685
Did you meet Johnny?

311
00:21:18,772 --> 00:21:22,924
Johnny Graziosi just finished eight years
in Sing Sing for loansharking.

312
00:21:23,132 --> 00:21:24,201
Vinnie?

313
00:21:24,532 --> 00:21:28,241
Vinnie "The Shrimp" D'Agostino!
Twenty years for double murder!

314
00:21:28,732 --> 00:21:30,290
Do you get the picture?

315
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,567
I don't understand. Are you saying...

316
00:21:32,652 --> 00:21:35,246
...your dad's some kind of Mob caterer?

317
00:21:36,492 --> 00:21:40,087
My father was in prison
till I was eight, Michael.

318
00:21:40,812 --> 00:21:42,530
He's one of them.

319
00:21:49,532 --> 00:21:50,521
Wow.

320
00:21:52,892 --> 00:21:54,803
Just keep walking.

321
00:21:57,332 --> 00:22:01,245
I should've told you months ago
or just walked away.

322
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:04,922
Normally I would have,
but I couldn't because I was so happy.

323
00:22:05,132 --> 00:22:07,202
Listen. I don't want to marry your father.

324
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:11,285
But you will, Michael, whether you like it
or not. Him and his friends.

325
00:22:11,492 --> 00:22:13,562
I can't let that happen, because I love you.

326
00:22:13,652 --> 00:22:16,291
Everything they touch ends up spoiled
and corrupted.

327
00:22:16,372 --> 00:22:21,082
Wait a minute! This is ridiculous.
For a start, I might not be corruptible.

328
00:22:21,812 --> 00:22:24,610
It's a little favor,
a tiny lie and you're theirs.

329
00:22:25,292 --> 00:22:26,964
Believe me, I've seen it.

330
00:22:27,052 --> 00:22:29,043
No, I'm sorry.

331
00:22:29,532 --> 00:22:31,602
It's just over, Michael.

332
00:22:35,092 --> 00:22:36,366
Well, no.

333
00:22:37,852 --> 00:22:42,482
I've waited all my life to find someone
I love as much as I love you.

334
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:47,282
And I'm just not gonna let this
or anyone come between us.

335
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:51,371
Not Vito "The Butcher"
or Vinnie "The Baker"...

336
00:22:51,572 --> 00:22:55,531
...or anyone involved in any kind
of food preparation. End of story.

337
00:22:55,732 --> 00:22:57,529
But you don't know how clever they are.

338
00:22:57,612 --> 00:23:01,605
You do, presumably, and you can tell me.
We can do this together.

339
00:23:04,612 --> 00:23:06,125
Completely together?

340
00:23:06,332 --> 00:23:08,402
Completely. I swear.

341
00:23:09,772 --> 00:23:11,490
Now just give in.

342
00:23:12,452 --> 00:23:13,771
Marry me.

343
00:23:18,092 --> 00:23:19,002
Yes.

344
00:23:23,332 --> 00:23:25,846
Smile, you're engaged!

345
00:23:26,532 --> 00:23:29,808
Great. Now just Gina and Michael.
Over here, I think--

346
00:23:30,012 --> 00:23:32,162
Happy engagement, you guys!

347
00:23:32,972 --> 00:23:34,724
-How's this?
-Okay, say "cheese."

348
00:23:34,812 --> 00:23:35,688
Cheese!

349
00:23:35,772 --> 00:23:38,161
You're right, he really does talk funny.

350
00:23:38,252 --> 00:23:40,720
Carol, you're really getting into this.

351
00:23:40,932 --> 00:23:45,608
I know. My therapist suggested it
as a way to get over my little blip.

352
00:23:46,572 --> 00:23:50,326
I think it's really working.
I feel terrific, especially tonight.

353
00:23:50,532 --> 00:23:53,410
I am so happy for you guys!

354
00:23:53,772 --> 00:23:55,046
Excuse me.

355
00:23:58,012 --> 00:24:00,242
Bad breakup. Long story.

356
00:24:01,012 --> 00:24:03,924
Let's go say hello to Uncle Vito. Come on.

357
00:24:04,612 --> 00:24:05,931
Here we go.

358
00:24:16,732 --> 00:24:18,404
Hey, Uncle Vito!

359
00:24:20,332 --> 00:24:22,323
Don't you look beautiful!

360
00:24:25,212 --> 00:24:28,284
Always so beautiful. You're like a flower.

361
00:24:28,492 --> 00:24:30,164
Well, you too, Uncle Vito.

362
00:24:30,572 --> 00:24:33,086
This is so nice.
We planned something much smaller.

363
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:34,400
Yes, thank you.

364
00:24:36,412 --> 00:24:37,845
Your school....

365
00:24:38,172 --> 00:24:39,446
How is everything?

366
00:24:39,532 --> 00:24:43,207
It's pretty good.
Only two shootings last week.

367
00:24:43,412 --> 00:24:45,164
It's got me sick with worry.

368
00:24:45,252 --> 00:24:47,368
Why do you want to worry your father?

369
00:24:47,572 --> 00:24:51,406
You want to transfer? I have a friend
of a friend in the supervisor's office.

370
00:24:51,492 --> 00:24:53,528
Thank you. I'll let you know.

371
00:24:59,692 --> 00:25:02,047
Are your family coming over
for the wedding?

372
00:25:02,172 --> 00:25:02,968
No.

373
00:25:03,092 --> 00:25:04,161
Michael's an orphan.

374
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:05,321
He was.

375
00:25:07,452 --> 00:25:09,124
I'm sorry to hear that.

376
00:25:09,932 --> 00:25:13,049
Tell me, Michael, I'm interested to know...

377
00:25:13,372 --> 00:25:15,488
...coming from a foreign culture...

378
00:25:15,692 --> 00:25:19,128
...you must have a different perspective
on all these killings.

379
00:25:26,932 --> 00:25:30,811
To speak honestly,
I can't say I really approve...

380
00:25:31,012 --> 00:25:34,129
...but my understanding is
that it's all part of your business...

381
00:25:34,212 --> 00:25:38,649
...and that people only get killed
who bring it on themselves.

382
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:44,408
The killings at Gina's high school.

383
00:25:48,732 --> 00:25:50,165
I'm against them.

384
00:25:53,532 --> 00:25:56,524
What do you say we show him
around the house a little?

385
00:26:02,532 --> 00:26:05,888
$250,000. You think it's worth that?

386
00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:08,971
Like I say, that's the great thing
about an auction.

387
00:26:09,052 --> 00:26:12,442
An object is worth
whatever anyone is willing to pay for it.

388
00:26:12,932 --> 00:26:15,127
That's an interesting perspective.

389
00:26:17,572 --> 00:26:19,688
Tell me what you think of this one.

390
00:26:23,132 --> 00:26:24,451
You like it?

391
00:26:29,532 --> 00:26:31,011
It's very...

392
00:26:31,612 --> 00:26:33,250
...intriguing, isn't it?

393
00:26:33,332 --> 00:26:35,004
Tell me, why does...

394
00:26:35,532 --> 00:26:37,363
...Jesus have a machine gun?

395
00:26:37,572 --> 00:26:42,327
It's symbolic. You have to ask Johnny.
He does them as part of his therapy.

396
00:26:43,052 --> 00:26:46,283
You have a very gifted son, Vito.
No two ways about it.

397
00:26:46,492 --> 00:26:48,562
Well, I must say, I like the way...

398
00:26:48,812 --> 00:26:52,248
-...the blood oozes out of his cranium.
-I like that.

399
00:26:54,852 --> 00:26:56,888
He's very talented, wouldn't you say?

400
00:26:56,972 --> 00:26:59,361
Yes, I think he certainly has something.

401
00:27:01,772 --> 00:27:03,888
I'm flattered that you like it.

402
00:27:05,172 --> 00:27:07,925
Listen, Michael. We should talk.

403
00:27:08,212 --> 00:27:10,806
I have friends in various fields...

404
00:27:10,972 --> 00:27:14,203
...that would be delighted
to help a friend of mine.

405
00:27:15,852 --> 00:27:19,322
Well, that's extremely kind of you...

406
00:27:20,852 --> 00:27:25,562
...but I've always had this silly thing about
standing on my own two feet in business.

407
00:27:27,332 --> 00:27:30,404
I hope you understand.

408
00:27:36,372 --> 00:27:37,851
Of course.

409
00:27:39,292 --> 00:27:41,203
I respect your feeling.

410
00:27:53,692 --> 00:27:55,330
"You're nobody...

411
00:27:56,412 --> 00:27:59,165
"...till somebody loves you"

412
00:28:01,852 --> 00:28:03,604
I'm so proud of you.

413
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,765
-No. You see, I am so proud of you.
-No, you.

414
00:28:06,972 --> 00:28:08,564
-No, you.
-Oh, shut up!

415
00:28:08,652 --> 00:28:09,801
All right.

416
00:28:11,492 --> 00:28:12,481
Perfect!

417
00:28:13,572 --> 00:28:16,086
I am so happy for you.

418
00:28:16,852 --> 00:28:18,331
One more!

419
00:28:20,412 --> 00:28:23,324
"Somebody to love. "

420
00:28:38,412 --> 00:28:41,324
Talk to Helen about tonight's catalog.

421
00:28:41,692 --> 00:28:44,445
Rent GoodFellas, Casino,
Godfa ther l, ll, Ill....

422
00:28:46,852 --> 00:28:49,605
Excuse me. Can I help you?

423
00:28:50,972 --> 00:28:53,042
How much is this one?

424
00:28:53,852 --> 00:28:56,889
On this, the reserve is $30,000, I think.

425
00:28:58,972 --> 00:29:02,282
That being, of course,
the opening bid on tonight's auction.

426
00:29:03,612 --> 00:29:06,410
Do you have much experience
when it comes to buying art?

427
00:29:06,492 --> 00:29:07,561
No.

428
00:29:07,772 --> 00:29:10,844
But I hear it can be a good investment.

429
00:29:11,612 --> 00:29:12,522
Yes.

430
00:29:12,652 --> 00:29:14,324
My father...

431
00:29:14,492 --> 00:29:16,289
...recently died...

432
00:29:18,052 --> 00:29:19,883
...and left me some money.

433
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:21,241
Your father?

434
00:29:21,372 --> 00:29:23,602
That must've been a terrible shock.

435
00:29:24,612 --> 00:29:27,922
If you're looking for something beautiful
to put on your wall...

436
00:29:28,012 --> 00:29:30,480
...you might like to think about a mirror.

437
00:29:34,452 --> 00:29:35,726
Oh, you!

438
00:29:35,972 --> 00:29:38,532
I really want a painting.

439
00:29:40,212 --> 00:29:42,168
-Can I have a word?
-One moment.

440
00:29:42,492 --> 00:29:47,088
Tonight, if there's a nice painting
going for less than it's really worth...

441
00:29:47,292 --> 00:29:50,170
...perhaps I could let you know about it.

442
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:52,249
You mean like a signal?

443
00:29:52,412 --> 00:29:53,527
Exactly.

444
00:29:53,732 --> 00:29:56,769
I have an important potential client
I have to talk to.

445
00:29:56,892 --> 00:30:00,328
I'll leave Helen here to work out
the exact details of this with you.

446
00:30:00,412 --> 00:30:02,164
-Where is he?
-Not here yet.

447
00:30:02,492 --> 00:30:04,289
But the trucks are.

448
00:30:04,652 --> 00:30:06,210
That means they're early.

449
00:30:06,292 --> 00:30:07,611
Incredible, huh?

450
00:30:08,252 --> 00:30:09,605
Fantastic!

451
00:30:12,572 --> 00:30:13,607
Hello.

452
00:30:14,052 --> 00:30:14,928
What?

453
00:30:21,212 --> 00:30:24,124
-So that's everything.
-Yes, sir. All 44 pieces.

454
00:30:24,852 --> 00:30:27,366
I just want you to know,
if I've said anything...

455
00:30:27,452 --> 00:30:30,888
...or done anything in the past
that in any way offended you...

456
00:30:31,612 --> 00:30:33,284
...l'm very deeply sorry.

457
00:30:36,532 --> 00:30:37,681
Thanks.

458
00:30:48,852 --> 00:30:50,331
-Are you okay?
-Sorry.

459
00:30:50,412 --> 00:30:53,051
Yes, I'm fine. I was just....

460
00:30:53,732 --> 00:30:57,122
The delivery was complete and on time.
It was a bit of a shock.

461
00:30:57,212 --> 00:30:58,327
I can imagine.

462
00:30:58,412 --> 00:31:00,004
Morganson's here.

463
00:31:00,212 --> 00:31:04,091
I thought you could soften him up a bit,
then I'll move in for the kill.

464
00:31:04,732 --> 00:31:05,767
Absolutely.

465
00:31:05,852 --> 00:31:06,807
Lovely.

466
00:31:07,492 --> 00:31:09,005
We do like to think we can...

467
00:31:09,092 --> 00:31:12,687
...match Sotheby's in the two qualities
most important to any auction house.

468
00:31:12,772 --> 00:31:16,082
One being, obviously,
a tradition of unquestioned respectability.

469
00:31:16,172 --> 00:31:19,448
And the other being,
for want of a better word...

470
00:31:19,612 --> 00:31:21,921
...shall we say, "class."

471
00:31:29,172 --> 00:31:31,481
I know Mr. Cromwell
is anxious to talk to you.

472
00:31:37,172 --> 00:31:39,640
I'm sorry, I'm confused.
What's the problem?

473
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:43,202
Mr. Graziosi wants me
to auction it for $50,000.

474
00:31:43,612 --> 00:31:47,400
People would pay $50,000 just to avoid
being in the same room as this thing.

475
00:31:47,492 --> 00:31:48,402
Michael, please.

476
00:31:48,492 --> 00:31:52,371
Your trucks show up on time
for the first time in God knows how long.

477
00:31:52,572 --> 00:31:55,848
And you get to give a little happiness
to an important friend.

478
00:31:55,932 --> 00:31:58,287
What's the matter?
I thought you'd be happy.

479
00:31:58,372 --> 00:31:59,521
No. Mr. Vitale--

480
00:31:59,612 --> 00:32:00,567
No, Dad.

481
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:03,928
You don't understand. This is exactly
what Gina said would happen.

482
00:32:04,012 --> 00:32:07,448
If she even found out
that this thing had been sent over here--

483
00:32:08,132 --> 00:32:09,326
You're early.

484
00:32:09,572 --> 00:32:11,130
Just on the phone with your dad.

485
00:32:11,212 --> 00:32:12,531
Let me talk.

486
00:32:16,612 --> 00:32:17,931
You got my message?

487
00:32:18,012 --> 00:32:20,480
Great. And everything's okay
for tomorrow?

488
00:32:21,252 --> 00:32:23,846
And tomorrow at noon
is okay for the fittings?

489
00:32:24,252 --> 00:32:26,812
Well, here's the deal. I'm gonna be there...

490
00:32:27,012 --> 00:32:30,084
...and Carol's gonna come along too,
to take photos.

491
00:32:30,692 --> 00:32:33,160
She's doing the whole wedding, so be nice.

492
00:32:34,532 --> 00:32:37,046
We have to talk
about the wedding reception.

493
00:32:38,812 --> 00:32:41,326
Now, I know you and Mom used Louie's--

494
00:32:43,932 --> 00:32:44,887
Hold on.

495
00:32:50,172 --> 00:32:54,404
We have two key attributes for which,
in this business, there is no substitute.

496
00:32:54,612 --> 00:32:58,400
The first being, obviously,
a tradition of unparalleled respectability.

497
00:32:58,492 --> 00:33:01,882
And the other being, shall we say,
for want of a better word--

498
00:33:05,932 --> 00:33:07,490
We'll come back later.

499
00:33:09,412 --> 00:33:11,289
Right. Fine.

500
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:13,164
Daddy, we have to go.

501
00:33:13,372 --> 00:33:14,600
I love you too.

502
00:33:16,092 --> 00:33:17,605
He wants to say 'bye.

503
00:33:20,572 --> 00:33:22,164
It's gonna be okay.

504
00:33:22,332 --> 00:33:26,120
You put the thing up for auction.
It don't sell, Gina will never know.

505
00:33:26,332 --> 00:33:28,129
I don't think I can do that.

506
00:33:30,012 --> 00:33:34,483
Listen, this favor....
If you don't do it, it's really not that great.

507
00:33:34,692 --> 00:33:37,286
Not for you, and to be honest with you,
not for me.

508
00:33:37,372 --> 00:33:40,125
So just do it this once,
and I'll talk to Vito...

509
00:33:40,212 --> 00:33:44,603
...and explain how in the future
you two would prefer to go it alone, okay?

510
00:33:45,852 --> 00:33:47,251
Is that a promise, Dad?

511
00:33:47,332 --> 00:33:48,685
That's a promise.

512
00:33:50,932 --> 00:33:54,288
Fabulous. Noon tomorrow then it is.
Okay, 'bye.

513
00:33:55,332 --> 00:33:56,924
What is wrong with you?

514
00:33:58,012 --> 00:33:59,650
You, come here!

515
00:34:05,372 --> 00:34:08,330
I swear to God, Frankie,
I ain't got the money!

516
00:34:09,092 --> 00:34:11,560
Now I gotta put you on mountain climb.

517
00:34:25,172 --> 00:34:27,288
-We worked out the signals.
-What?

518
00:34:27,572 --> 00:34:29,085
With the old lady.

519
00:34:29,532 --> 00:34:31,807
If you want her to start bidding, you cough.

520
00:34:31,892 --> 00:34:32,802
Easy enough.

521
00:34:32,892 --> 00:34:35,884
If you want her to stop bidding,
you just say "ha."

522
00:34:36,092 --> 00:34:38,765
Fine. What? Say what?

523
00:34:39,212 --> 00:34:40,201
Ha!

524
00:34:45,092 --> 00:34:46,889
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

525
00:34:46,972 --> 00:34:49,964
And welcome to
"Portraiture: 1450 to 1750. "

526
00:34:59,812 --> 00:35:01,450
And down it goes, then...

527
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:04,968
...at $25,000 to bidder number 977.

528
00:35:06,452 --> 00:35:09,171
And so to our final piece of the evening...

529
00:35:10,012 --> 00:35:13,641
...and a last-minute addition
to your catalog...

530
00:35:13,852 --> 00:35:16,412
...lot number 277A...

531
00:35:16,612 --> 00:35:19,763
...oil on canvas, signed by the artist:

532
00:35:20,092 --> 00:35:23,880
The Road To Damascus
by Jonathan Graziosi.

533
00:35:25,452 --> 00:35:26,646
This item...

534
00:35:26,732 --> 00:35:30,122
...has a reserve of $50,000.
$50,000, anyone?

535
00:35:30,812 --> 00:35:31,642
No.

536
00:35:31,732 --> 00:35:34,166
Well, too bad. Thank you very much.

537
00:35:34,452 --> 00:35:36,522
That concludes the business for--

538
00:35:38,172 --> 00:35:39,287
Was that....

539
00:35:43,252 --> 00:35:45,482
We have $50,000.

540
00:35:46,612 --> 00:35:49,001
$50,000.

541
00:35:50,252 --> 00:35:51,651
$55,000, anyone?

542
00:35:53,252 --> 00:35:55,402
All through. All done, then...

543
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:59,127
...at $50,000 to bidder number 235.

544
00:36:00,412 --> 00:36:02,687
I believe that's a record for a Graziosi.

545
00:36:02,772 --> 00:36:06,401
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen, and good night.

546
00:36:13,052 --> 00:36:16,249
You snuck that last one in on me,
didn't you?

547
00:36:16,412 --> 00:36:18,368
Yes, I'm afraid so. I'm sorry.

548
00:36:18,452 --> 00:36:20,090
Do that more often.

549
00:36:20,412 --> 00:36:23,768
Congratulations. Quite a painting
you have for yourself, sir.

550
00:36:24,092 --> 00:36:25,810
Thank you. I appreciate that.

551
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:28,725
I'm sorry. Have we met somewhere?

552
00:36:29,052 --> 00:36:30,451
I don't believe so.

553
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:33,286
But may I ask,
do either of you enjoy steak?

554
00:36:33,452 --> 00:36:34,805
Very much so.

555
00:36:35,292 --> 00:36:38,011
University and 9th. I'm very proud of it.

556
00:36:45,252 --> 00:36:48,608
You make me very proud
and Johnny very happy.

557
00:36:50,052 --> 00:36:52,043
There's something going on here!

558
00:36:52,812 --> 00:36:55,372
-Nothing's going on.
-I don't like your face.

559
00:37:01,972 --> 00:37:04,645
Frank? I've been trying
to get you since last night.

560
00:37:04,732 --> 00:37:08,281
Listen, it sold. Did you know
that the painting actually sold?

561
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:10,562
Right on. I heard. That's great.

562
00:37:10,892 --> 00:37:13,281
Did you talk to your friend?

563
00:37:13,492 --> 00:37:16,006
That is it, right? Finito, no more favors.

564
00:37:16,212 --> 00:37:17,440
Trust me, Michael.

565
00:37:17,532 --> 00:37:19,488
-It's gonna be okay.
-Great.

566
00:37:19,692 --> 00:37:23,162
Wait. Wait. Sorry.
It is, or it's going to be?

567
00:37:23,292 --> 00:37:24,645
Hello?

568
00:37:24,732 --> 00:37:27,121
Sorry, gotta go. See you at the tailor.

569
00:37:33,212 --> 00:37:35,806
Excuse me. What's going on?

570
00:37:36,012 --> 00:37:37,889
Big fire over on 72nd Street.

571
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:39,525
A restaurant or something?

572
00:37:39,612 --> 00:37:40,840
Some art place.

573
00:37:43,492 --> 00:37:44,561
Sotheby's?

574
00:37:45,052 --> 00:37:46,087
That's it.

575
00:38:18,132 --> 00:38:20,851
There are some men here
to see you from the FBl.

576
00:38:23,932 --> 00:38:24,887
Good.

577
00:38:25,692 --> 00:38:26,807
Good, good.

578
00:38:30,532 --> 00:38:32,523
We often sell works by first-time artists.

579
00:38:32,612 --> 00:38:34,842
I don't see how this time is any different.

580
00:38:34,932 --> 00:38:38,083
The difference is this painting was bought
by a restaurant owner...

581
00:38:38,292 --> 00:38:40,886
...who owed the artist's father $50,000.

582
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:44,125
It's a setup.
They bought it from themselves.

583
00:38:44,412 --> 00:38:48,485
I don't understand. Someone buys your
painting for $50,000, you make $50,000.

584
00:38:48,692 --> 00:38:51,001
But if they owed you the money,
you make nothing.

585
00:38:51,092 --> 00:38:52,969
It's called money laundering.

586
00:38:54,492 --> 00:38:55,527
You mind?

587
00:38:55,932 --> 00:38:57,160
Not at all, no.

588
00:38:58,652 --> 00:39:01,166
They do it through car washes,
restaurants...

589
00:39:01,252 --> 00:39:03,766
...bars and, last night, through you.

590
00:39:04,252 --> 00:39:06,482
Have you at any time come into contact...

591
00:39:06,652 --> 00:39:09,883
...with anyone who might be connected
with organized crime?

592
00:39:13,692 --> 00:39:14,920
Absolutely not.

593
00:39:16,492 --> 00:39:17,971
You sure about that?

594
00:39:19,132 --> 00:39:20,611
I am positive.

595
00:39:40,452 --> 00:39:42,090
Are we okay to see Michael?

596
00:39:42,172 --> 00:39:44,402
He's in with the FBl.

597
00:39:45,692 --> 00:39:46,727
Lovely.

598
00:39:47,572 --> 00:39:49,051
Perhaps later, then.

599
00:39:49,492 --> 00:39:50,925
Have you had lunch?

600
00:39:55,772 --> 00:39:57,763
Thank you very much for the warning.

601
00:39:57,852 --> 00:40:01,208
If anything like this crops up again,
I'll certainly be in touch.

602
00:40:01,292 --> 00:40:02,850
We'd appreciate that.

603
00:40:02,932 --> 00:40:05,571
We're dealing with something
pretty ugly here.

604
00:40:06,132 --> 00:40:07,645
Here's my card.

605
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:09,448
Thank you.

606
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,170
Oh, those. Thank you.

607
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:16,525
Gina is in reception.

608
00:40:16,972 --> 00:40:18,325
Good. Thank you.

609
00:40:20,012 --> 00:40:22,651
I know what you're thinking.
It's okay. Relax.

610
00:40:23,372 --> 00:40:24,725
Mr. Felgate.

611
00:40:24,932 --> 00:40:26,570
Where did you want this?

612
00:40:31,292 --> 00:40:33,806
In my office. Thank you. Quick as you can.

613
00:40:41,732 --> 00:40:45,361
Vito and Johnny are taking more
of a liking to the idea...

614
00:40:45,572 --> 00:40:48,530
...than any of us had perhaps
originally anticipated.

615
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:51,570
My God! It's out of control!
You can't control it!

616
00:40:51,772 --> 00:40:54,161
Listen now. It is not out of control.

617
00:40:54,532 --> 00:40:56,170
I have to tell Gina.

618
00:40:56,772 --> 00:40:59,730
Tonight is your last auction
of the season, right?

619
00:41:00,092 --> 00:41:01,969
Just keep Gina away from there.

620
00:41:02,052 --> 00:41:03,883
Sell the painting, go on your honeymoon.

621
00:41:03,972 --> 00:41:06,805
When you come back,
everything will be taken care of.

622
00:41:07,012 --> 00:41:09,924
I am not lying to Gina. I have to tell her.

623
00:41:10,132 --> 00:41:11,406
Michael, please.

624
00:41:11,492 --> 00:41:15,610
Gina's happiness means more to me than
anything in the world. You know that.

625
00:41:16,332 --> 00:41:19,529
If you tell her now that you already lied...

626
00:41:19,932 --> 00:41:21,285
...it's all over.

627
00:41:28,412 --> 00:41:30,368
Goddamn it!

628
00:41:32,692 --> 00:41:33,841
This is your fault!

629
00:41:33,932 --> 00:41:37,049
You know, I've been on your side
every step of the way.

630
00:41:37,252 --> 00:41:40,562
If you were a plumber,
would we be having this conversation?

631
00:41:45,532 --> 00:41:48,524
Look at you!

632
00:41:48,732 --> 00:41:50,370
Wait. Where's Ritchie?

633
00:41:54,332 --> 00:41:55,287
Smile!

634
00:41:57,452 --> 00:41:58,885
What's the matter with you?

635
00:41:58,972 --> 00:42:00,166
I don't know.

636
00:42:00,452 --> 00:42:02,920
So, are you guys busy tonight?

637
00:42:03,292 --> 00:42:06,841
Actually, I'm gonna go to Michael's
big auction. You wanna come?

638
00:42:07,372 --> 00:42:08,327
Yes.

639
00:42:09,092 --> 00:42:10,810
We should talk about that.

640
00:42:11,092 --> 00:42:11,968
What?

641
00:42:12,092 --> 00:42:16,085
Tonight. I've been thinking about it.
You know, it's quite a big deal.

642
00:42:16,292 --> 00:42:18,681
Morganson's gonna be there again...

643
00:42:19,652 --> 00:42:23,008
...and I'm just afraid I might get put off
if you were there.

644
00:42:23,412 --> 00:42:25,528
I know it sounds silly.

645
00:42:25,692 --> 00:42:29,731
I just might not be able to see the bids
because I'd, you know...

646
00:42:30,812 --> 00:42:33,246
...not be able to look at you.

647
00:42:35,652 --> 00:42:37,608
What? What is it?

648
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,405
What is it?

649
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:41,524
I'm fine.

650
00:42:42,492 --> 00:42:43,720
Just, he....

651
00:42:45,212 --> 00:42:49,649
He loves you so much,
and I am so happy for you.

652
00:42:53,852 --> 00:42:57,447
No, it's so great.

653
00:42:59,412 --> 00:43:01,243
It's so good.

654
00:43:17,692 --> 00:43:21,082
And so, finally, to lot 125A.

655
00:43:21,412 --> 00:43:24,609
And another of our occasional
Jonathan Graziosi's.

656
00:43:25,132 --> 00:43:27,771
This unusual painting is entitled:

657
00:43:27,932 --> 00:43:29,604
Die, Piggy-Piggy, Die, Die...

658
00:43:29,692 --> 00:43:32,047
...and has a reserve of $80,000.

659
00:43:33,132 --> 00:43:35,248
At $80,000, then.

660
00:43:37,492 --> 00:43:38,447
Anyone?

661
00:43:40,412 --> 00:43:41,640
Bid.

662
00:43:41,852 --> 00:43:43,251
$80,000.

663
00:43:51,612 --> 00:43:52,681
Excuse me.

664
00:43:55,932 --> 00:43:57,047
Is that...?

665
00:43:58,772 --> 00:43:59,841
We have...

666
00:44:00,772 --> 00:44:03,127
...$80,000, lady at the front.

667
00:44:04,972 --> 00:44:06,690
$85,000, anyone?

668
00:44:09,532 --> 00:44:13,730
$85,000, gentleman at the back.
No advance. No one else. All through--

669
00:44:15,612 --> 00:44:17,887
$90,000.

670
00:44:18,852 --> 00:44:20,285
$90,000.

671
00:44:21,132 --> 00:44:22,121
Ha!

672
00:44:22,412 --> 00:44:24,323
Anyone at $95,000?

673
00:44:24,532 --> 00:44:26,762
Be smart, take her money.
Let me pay you later!

674
00:44:26,852 --> 00:44:29,002
You're supposed to buy the painting.

675
00:44:29,132 --> 00:44:32,169
-But you can make double the money!
-Just doing my job.

676
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:34,322
Yes, $95,000. Ha!

677
00:44:36,732 --> 00:44:38,927
$100,000.

678
00:44:39,532 --> 00:44:41,727
Anyone at $105,000?

679
00:44:43,492 --> 00:44:46,006
$105,000, gentleman at the back.

680
00:44:46,172 --> 00:44:48,732
May I remind you,
we recently sold a Graziosi...

681
00:44:48,812 --> 00:44:52,088
...for a record $50,000,
the most ever paid for a Graziosi.

682
00:44:52,732 --> 00:44:56,247
$50,000, less than, ha, half
the current bidding price.

683
00:44:59,292 --> 00:45:00,964
$110,000.

684
00:45:01,172 --> 00:45:03,208
Anyone at $115?

685
00:45:05,572 --> 00:45:06,607
Sir?

686
00:45:07,652 --> 00:45:08,687
$115?

687
00:45:09,012 --> 00:45:10,365
I told you.

688
00:45:11,412 --> 00:45:15,769
Certainly, to let this go for $110,000 would
be a crime of the greatest magnitude.

689
00:45:20,332 --> 00:45:22,641
Yes! $115,000, gentleman at the back.

690
00:45:22,852 --> 00:45:26,162
All done, and down it goes at $115,000
to bidder number 702.

691
00:45:26,372 --> 00:45:30,331
That brings us to the end of the auction.
Thank you. Good night.

692
00:45:34,212 --> 00:45:36,282
I can't talk. I have to see Gina.

693
00:45:44,812 --> 00:45:47,849
Gina told me the happy news.
I'm baking you two a cake.

694
00:45:49,092 --> 00:45:50,764
That's incredibly nice of you.

695
00:45:50,852 --> 00:45:52,808
I'll see you a bit later, then.

696
00:46:13,692 --> 00:46:15,444
Who are you? What is this?

697
00:46:15,612 --> 00:46:18,809
It's the three-month anniversary
of our very first date.

698
00:46:19,132 --> 00:46:20,770
I'm a complete...

699
00:46:21,372 --> 00:46:22,725
...idiot. Sorry.

700
00:46:22,972 --> 00:46:24,610
But do you mind company?

701
00:46:24,772 --> 00:46:25,568
Who?

702
00:46:29,812 --> 00:46:32,280
Humans and gorillas are primates.

703
00:46:32,492 --> 00:46:34,528
-He reminded me of you.
-He would.

704
00:46:34,612 --> 00:46:36,364
Happy anniversary.

705
00:46:37,372 --> 00:46:41,411
My God. I feel so horrible that
I didn't remember to get anything for you.

706
00:46:43,012 --> 00:46:44,365
Oh, my God!

707
00:46:45,412 --> 00:46:46,322
Swap?

708
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:49,048
You can't afford this!

709
00:46:50,612 --> 00:46:51,806
Come here.

710
00:46:54,772 --> 00:46:56,842
I have an opposable thumb.

711
00:46:57,052 --> 00:46:58,246
Gina, hang on.

712
00:46:58,332 --> 00:47:00,288
Calm down. Calm down.

713
00:47:00,492 --> 00:47:03,245
Listen, I can afford it, because, you know...

714
00:47:03,452 --> 00:47:06,569
...things have been going really well
at work recently.

715
00:47:06,772 --> 00:47:07,966
Apart from...

716
00:47:11,492 --> 00:47:15,804
...this one thing that I think
we should talk about, okay?

717
00:47:22,772 --> 00:47:24,046
I'll go.

718
00:47:31,292 --> 00:47:32,361
Who is it?

719
00:47:34,532 --> 00:47:37,444
It's Jehovah bloody Witnesses.

720
00:47:37,732 --> 00:47:40,485
Please go away. Thank you.
We're not interested.

721
00:47:42,612 --> 00:47:44,330
They must be very devoted.

722
00:47:44,492 --> 00:47:45,447
Hang on.

723
00:47:45,532 --> 00:47:46,601
Excuse me.

724
00:47:46,932 --> 00:47:49,048
I want my money now.

725
00:47:49,252 --> 00:47:53,404
-I can't talk about this now.
-No talk. Money. Now!

726
00:47:55,332 --> 00:47:56,242
Hello, Gina.

727
00:47:56,692 --> 00:47:58,364
Michael, what's going on?

728
00:47:58,572 --> 00:48:01,848
Prince Charles here just cost me $130,000.

729
00:48:02,052 --> 00:48:05,601
And he's gonna make it up
out of his own pocket. What's this worth?

730
00:48:05,692 --> 00:48:08,490
They were auctioning Johnny's paintings
to launder money.

731
00:48:08,572 --> 00:48:09,607
Not "they."

732
00:48:09,692 --> 00:48:10,568
"We."

733
00:48:10,772 --> 00:48:13,969
And a connoisseur had the taste
to try to buy some of my art.

734
00:48:14,052 --> 00:48:16,725
She was 90 years old and blind.
She wasn't a connoisseur.

735
00:48:16,812 --> 00:48:19,610
Your jerk fiancé wouldn't even let her bid.

736
00:48:19,772 --> 00:48:22,286
Cheating innocent collectors
wasn't part of the deal!

737
00:48:22,372 --> 00:48:23,600
You had a deal?

738
00:48:24,092 --> 00:48:25,002
No. No.

739
00:48:25,092 --> 00:48:27,481
When angered, I make this sound....

740
00:48:27,972 --> 00:48:31,601
Then how come you took commission
from the painting I sold last night?

741
00:48:31,692 --> 00:48:33,922
This is why you told me
not to come tonight.

742
00:48:34,012 --> 00:48:36,924
Because if I was there,
you'd have trouble not looking at me.

743
00:48:37,012 --> 00:48:38,730
Very smooth. Very smooth.

744
00:48:38,812 --> 00:48:41,485
Did you take a commission?
ls that how you afforded this?

745
00:48:41,572 --> 00:48:44,166
We burst your little
Town & Country bubble here?

746
00:48:44,252 --> 00:48:45,924
I don't know who you think you are--

747
00:48:46,012 --> 00:48:47,968
-That's it! Get out.
-Don't touch me!

748
00:48:48,052 --> 00:48:49,610
All right. All right.

749
00:48:49,692 --> 00:48:51,683
Other primates fear the gorilla.

750
00:48:51,812 --> 00:48:53,530
Don't be a moron, Johnny.

751
00:48:53,892 --> 00:48:56,770
Just relax, okay? Relax.

752
00:48:57,052 --> 00:48:59,612
Come on, Johnny. You don't need the gun.

753
00:49:00,412 --> 00:49:02,050
You're right. I don't.

754
00:49:05,932 --> 00:49:08,810
I hate to do this
to such a beautiful establishment...

755
00:49:08,892 --> 00:49:11,122
...but you gotta learn how to pay up!

756
00:49:12,252 --> 00:49:13,128
Stop.

757
00:49:14,532 --> 00:49:15,567
Stop!

758
00:49:21,492 --> 00:49:24,086
My diet is leaves and fresh fruit.

759
00:49:24,572 --> 00:49:25,687
Oh, my God!

760
00:49:26,012 --> 00:49:28,401
What happened? Did it ricochet?

761
00:49:31,772 --> 00:49:32,887
He's dead.

762
00:49:35,572 --> 00:49:38,405
Oh, my God! Oh, my God....

763
00:49:39,652 --> 00:49:41,608
It's not your fault. It's okay.

764
00:49:41,692 --> 00:49:44,604
Here's what we'll do.
I'm gonna call the police.

765
00:49:45,412 --> 00:49:46,925
You can't.

766
00:49:47,132 --> 00:49:49,168
They own half the police.

767
00:49:50,252 --> 00:49:51,287
What have I done?

768
00:49:51,372 --> 00:49:52,691
Don't you worry.

769
00:49:52,972 --> 00:49:55,532
-You go home. I'll call your father.
-Daddy?

770
00:49:55,612 --> 00:49:57,170
We can deal with this.

771
00:49:58,612 --> 00:50:00,091
You're one of the guys now.

772
00:50:00,172 --> 00:50:02,367
Gina, listen to me. That's not true.

773
00:50:02,572 --> 00:50:05,370
No, you're right. This is a job for the boys.

774
00:50:05,652 --> 00:50:07,608
-You don't understand.
-Don't touch me!

775
00:50:07,692 --> 00:50:10,968
I do. I understand perfectly.
I've always understood.

776
00:50:11,292 --> 00:50:15,570
That's why I warned you. That's why
you swore to me this wouldn't happen.

777
00:50:15,772 --> 00:50:17,000
Let me explain!

778
00:50:17,212 --> 00:50:19,646
-I'll just put this in the kitchen.
-No!

779
00:50:20,412 --> 00:50:24,087
No, thank you. Thank you so much,
but I just learned I'm diabetic.

780
00:50:24,412 --> 00:50:26,801
Thank you so much
for the thought, though.

781
00:50:38,852 --> 00:50:40,968
Funny how life imitates art.

782
00:50:43,292 --> 00:50:44,805
All right.

783
00:50:45,332 --> 00:50:47,926
Don't worry. We can handle this.

784
00:50:48,892 --> 00:50:50,325
It's gonna be okay.

785
00:50:52,092 --> 00:50:56,005
First thing, do you have any plastic bags?

786
00:50:56,572 --> 00:50:57,800
Absolutely.

787
00:51:01,852 --> 00:51:04,412
Jesus. Sweet Jesus.

788
00:51:05,532 --> 00:51:06,442
Here.

789
00:51:08,852 --> 00:51:10,922
What am I supposed to do with that?

790
00:51:11,772 --> 00:51:13,046
I don't know.

791
00:51:13,452 --> 00:51:14,931
I thought perhaps...

792
00:51:15,332 --> 00:51:16,447
...the gun?

793
00:51:19,652 --> 00:51:21,210
Bigger? Right.

794
00:51:28,932 --> 00:51:30,331
Sorry! Sorry!

795
00:51:30,532 --> 00:51:32,966
The trick is to hook up under the armpits.

796
00:51:38,692 --> 00:51:40,364
Good evening again, Mrs. Horton.

797
00:51:40,452 --> 00:51:43,728
Just getting rid of all the food with sugar.

798
00:51:46,772 --> 00:51:47,966
Don't push.

799
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:47,198
Shit!

800
00:52:59,683 --> 00:53:01,674
-Would you stay down?
-I am down!

801
00:53:02,803 --> 00:53:03,952
Frankie?

802
00:53:05,643 --> 00:53:06,598
Al?

803
00:53:06,883 --> 00:53:07,838
It's Frankie.

804
00:53:07,923 --> 00:53:09,276
Vitale?

805
00:53:10,643 --> 00:53:11,632
It's Al.

806
00:53:15,643 --> 00:53:17,076
Unbelievable.

807
00:53:18,563 --> 00:53:20,155
My God, Sante.

808
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:21,512
Did you get hit?

809
00:53:21,603 --> 00:53:23,958
Are you kidding?
Thank God we're chickenshits!

810
00:53:24,043 --> 00:53:26,682
Real tough guys would've stood there
and aimed.

811
00:53:27,243 --> 00:53:29,598
So who's your friend?

812
00:53:31,843 --> 00:53:34,437
That's Big Mickey from Kansas City.
Friend of ours.

813
00:53:34,643 --> 00:53:36,554
I thought Big Mickey was dead.

814
00:53:37,163 --> 00:53:39,074
The father. This is Little Big Mickey.

815
00:53:39,163 --> 00:53:41,677
Wasn't there a Little Big Mickey
out of Chicago?

816
00:53:41,763 --> 00:53:45,312
That's the original Little Big Mickey.
This is Little Big Mickey Blue Eyes.

817
00:53:45,403 --> 00:53:47,314
So you work for Tony Two-Tone.

818
00:53:50,563 --> 00:53:53,282
Who you got over there?
ls that Sonny Marsalino?

819
00:53:53,363 --> 00:53:54,921
Wasn't he in witness protection?

820
00:53:55,003 --> 00:53:57,756
Took us seven years.
Tracked him and whacked him.

821
00:53:58,563 --> 00:54:00,474
"Tracked him and whacked him."

822
00:54:00,563 --> 00:54:02,281
So who's your guy?

823
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:04,517
He's a nobody.

824
00:54:04,723 --> 00:54:07,191
Frankie, come on. We showed you ours.

825
00:54:07,363 --> 00:54:09,274
What? We in the second grade?

826
00:54:09,643 --> 00:54:12,282
He's a witness. I really can't talk about it.

827
00:54:12,963 --> 00:54:15,113
Then we should get these guys
in the ground.

828
00:54:15,203 --> 00:54:16,522
Good. Good to see you.

829
00:54:16,643 --> 00:54:17,837
You too.

830
00:54:18,403 --> 00:54:19,995
God bless. Take care.

831
00:54:21,643 --> 00:54:23,281
Let's go. We gotta move him.

832
00:54:23,363 --> 00:54:25,319
-Oh, my God.
-Come on. Come on!

833
00:54:27,043 --> 00:54:29,034
-I gotta dig?
-You dig. It's your turn.

834
00:54:29,123 --> 00:54:31,637
-You shot him.
-So? I whacked him, you dig.

835
00:54:33,243 --> 00:54:35,393
You know what? I wish I was him.

836
00:54:35,603 --> 00:54:36,797
No, you don't.

837
00:54:36,923 --> 00:54:39,039
You're right. I wish you were him.

838
00:54:41,603 --> 00:54:43,241
Here, here, here, here.

839
00:54:43,643 --> 00:54:44,962
Wipe yourself.

840
00:54:48,003 --> 00:54:50,312
-You got a $100 bill?
-Why?

841
00:54:50,523 --> 00:54:52,718
Get in the car. Don't worry about it.

842
00:54:52,803 --> 00:54:54,919
Look, one thing....

843
00:54:55,723 --> 00:54:57,634
If any of this gets out...

844
00:54:58,243 --> 00:55:00,518
...l'm the one that shot Johnny, okay?

845
00:55:00,963 --> 00:55:02,874
Can we at least agree on that?

846
00:55:04,763 --> 00:55:06,196
You got it.

847
00:55:14,723 --> 00:55:15,997
You all right?

848
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:18,076
You got my messages?

849
00:55:20,043 --> 00:55:22,557
You buried him and then you dug him up.

850
00:55:23,043 --> 00:55:25,159
And now you don't know where he is.

851
00:55:26,243 --> 00:55:27,517
No, not exactly.

852
00:55:27,603 --> 00:55:29,719
Yeah, I got your messages.

853
00:55:33,323 --> 00:55:34,642
How're you feeling?

854
00:55:36,563 --> 00:55:38,554
Obviously, it's my first murder.

855
00:55:38,843 --> 00:55:42,722
On top of which, I feel like I'm going crazy,
and I'm scared.

856
00:55:42,923 --> 00:55:44,879
And the one person I wanna turn to...

857
00:55:44,963 --> 00:55:47,523
...turns out to be a liar and a fraud.

858
00:55:48,203 --> 00:55:49,272
Other than that--

859
00:55:49,363 --> 00:55:50,557
I'm not a liar.

860
00:55:50,643 --> 00:55:52,793
Yes, I am a liar.

861
00:55:52,963 --> 00:55:54,191
Just let me--

862
00:55:55,843 --> 00:55:58,311
I don't think I can. I'm sorry. I have to go.

863
00:55:58,403 --> 00:55:59,552
Wait.

864
00:56:00,723 --> 00:56:02,236
Hold out your hand.

865
00:56:04,163 --> 00:56:05,278
Here.

866
00:56:05,603 --> 00:56:09,312
Just hang on to it
till I've had a chance to explain.

867
00:56:12,843 --> 00:56:16,597
Come over for lunch tomorrow
and I'll listen to what you have to say.

868
00:56:20,563 --> 00:56:23,441
This is Patrick Richards
reporting from Central Park...

869
00:56:23,523 --> 00:56:27,721
...where police found the body
of 31-year-old Jonathan Graziosi...

870
00:56:27,923 --> 00:56:30,721
...son of reputed Mob boss Vito Graziosi.

871
00:56:31,403 --> 00:56:35,840
Sources tell us the body was found
with a rolled-up $100 bill in one nostril...

872
00:56:36,003 --> 00:56:39,200
...calling card of the notorious
Risolli crime family.

873
00:56:39,363 --> 00:56:42,435
Johnny was at the beginning
of a flourishing art career.

874
00:57:07,923 --> 00:57:11,313
Tony Risolli called. They wanna talk.

875
00:57:12,523 --> 00:57:14,514
Okay. Set it up.

876
00:57:19,203 --> 00:57:22,001
As soon as they pull up,
we should blow them away.

877
00:57:24,563 --> 00:57:26,793
Let's listen to what they got to say.

878
00:57:48,883 --> 00:57:52,637
Mr. Risolli says he swears
on the soul of his mother...

879
00:57:52,843 --> 00:57:54,913
...he had nothing to do with this.

880
00:57:55,043 --> 00:57:56,158
Then who?

881
00:58:02,923 --> 00:58:05,039
A cop in the 20th precinct tipped us.

882
00:58:05,123 --> 00:58:09,116
They towed Johnny's car from a building
on the Upper West Side.

883
00:58:10,003 --> 00:58:11,675
That's the address.

884
00:58:14,723 --> 00:58:15,678
Go.

885
00:58:16,803 --> 00:58:17,918
No, wait.

886
00:58:20,403 --> 00:58:24,840
You don't want everyone stomping around
up there, scaring people away.

887
00:58:26,123 --> 00:58:28,842
How about I go in there
with a detective's badge?

888
00:58:28,923 --> 00:58:31,232
You know, ask around. Keep it quiet.

889
00:58:31,963 --> 00:58:34,796
We find the right zebra,
we tear him to pieces.

890
00:58:52,003 --> 00:58:53,880
Tickle my tummy!

891
00:59:11,363 --> 00:59:14,673
Which apartment was the old lady in
that saw us with Johnny?

892
00:59:15,043 --> 00:59:16,158
Why?

893
00:59:18,443 --> 00:59:20,001
They know he was here.

894
00:59:20,483 --> 00:59:22,917
We need to talk to her about it.

895
00:59:31,123 --> 00:59:33,034
What's that? What are you gonna do?

896
00:59:33,123 --> 00:59:35,193
Please. I am not gonna hurt her.

897
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:36,591
-No, Listen--
-You can't--

898
00:59:36,683 --> 00:59:39,436
-If we don't do this, we'll both die.
-Who is it?

899
00:59:39,803 --> 00:59:42,397
Michael Felgate
and his harmless friend Frank.

900
00:59:42,523 --> 00:59:44,320
Mrs. Horton, do not open--

901
00:59:44,523 --> 00:59:45,319
What?

902
00:59:45,443 --> 00:59:48,003
Mrs. Horton, he said,
"Please open the door."

903
00:59:48,123 --> 00:59:51,160
You're Michael's friend?
The garbage helper?

904
00:59:51,483 --> 00:59:53,280
Yes, the garbage helper.

905
00:59:53,883 --> 00:59:55,282
Would you stop it?

906
01:00:04,323 --> 01:00:06,200
What are you guys doing here?

907
01:00:06,403 --> 01:00:08,963
Mr. Risolli thought we should check it out.

908
01:00:10,203 --> 01:00:11,795
Hey, Mickey Blue!

909
01:00:13,083 --> 01:00:14,562
Thank you very much.

910
01:00:14,683 --> 01:00:17,595
If you remember anything else,
call that number.

911
01:00:19,803 --> 01:00:23,000
We covered this place,
but most of the people are at work.

912
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:27,162
How about we grab some steak,
we all come back later this afternoon?

913
01:00:27,363 --> 01:00:29,752
We look like we ever said no to a steak?

914
01:00:29,963 --> 01:00:31,715
And I got the perfect place.

915
01:00:31,803 --> 01:00:32,997
You'll love it, Frank.

916
01:00:33,083 --> 01:00:34,436
Follow us.

917
01:00:45,323 --> 01:00:46,995
Hey. Forget about it!

918
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:49,154
"Hey. Forget about it."

919
01:00:49,883 --> 01:00:52,033
"Forget about it." No R's.

920
01:00:52,323 --> 01:00:53,836
"Forget about it."

921
01:00:54,043 --> 01:00:55,715
Now change the T's to D's.

922
01:00:55,803 --> 01:00:57,395
"Forget about it."

923
01:00:57,803 --> 01:00:58,713
"ld"?

924
01:00:58,923 --> 01:01:00,914
You said change the T's to D's!

925
01:01:01,123 --> 01:01:02,442
Not the last one.

926
01:01:02,523 --> 01:01:04,514
Change them, but not the last one.

927
01:01:04,603 --> 01:01:06,116
Wait, forget about it.

928
01:01:06,203 --> 01:01:07,079
Stop.

929
01:01:07,203 --> 01:01:08,602
Try this one here:

930
01:01:09,403 --> 01:01:10,995
"Get the hell outta here." No Rs.

931
01:01:11,083 --> 01:01:13,119
"Get the hell outta here."

932
01:01:13,323 --> 01:01:14,676
Not "hee." "Here."

933
01:01:18,883 --> 01:01:22,922
Keep your mouth shut and stick this
in your pants. Maybe you'll look the part.

934
01:01:23,003 --> 01:01:25,233
Maybe I should just shoot Mrs. Horton...

935
01:01:25,323 --> 01:01:27,791
...and save you going back with your rope.

936
01:01:28,003 --> 01:01:30,801
-You thought that was to strangle her?
-What else?

937
01:01:30,883 --> 01:01:35,195
Tie her up so I could take her to my cabin.
I mean, my God!

938
01:01:35,403 --> 01:01:37,155
What kind of person do you think I am?

939
01:01:37,243 --> 01:01:40,792
The kind of person who knows the trick
for carrying a dead body.

940
01:01:42,083 --> 01:01:43,198
Oh, my God!

941
01:01:43,963 --> 01:01:45,396
Hey, get outta here.

942
01:01:45,603 --> 01:01:47,719
-No, just forget about it.
-"Forget about it."

943
01:01:47,803 --> 01:01:49,714
No, I mean, shut up.

944
01:01:49,923 --> 01:01:52,153
Please, shut up!

945
01:01:52,443 --> 01:01:53,637
"Forget about it."

946
01:02:15,163 --> 01:02:18,280
My God! I sold him the painting.
He knows who I am.

947
01:02:19,003 --> 01:02:20,641
This can't be happening.

948
01:02:22,523 --> 01:02:24,400
You gentlemen ready to order?

949
01:02:25,243 --> 01:02:29,316
Just a salad and some mineral water.
I'm counting my cholesterol.

950
01:02:30,123 --> 01:02:34,196
I'll have a sirloin, medium, fried onions,
baked potato with everything on it.

951
01:02:34,843 --> 01:02:35,958
And a beer.

952
01:02:36,123 --> 01:02:37,112
Same.

953
01:02:37,923 --> 01:02:39,038
And you?

954
01:02:39,483 --> 01:02:40,313
Same.

955
01:02:40,603 --> 01:02:42,559
How you want your steak cooked?

956
01:02:47,203 --> 01:02:48,477
Rare.

957
01:02:48,683 --> 01:02:49,718
What?

958
01:02:50,523 --> 01:02:51,512
Raw.

959
01:02:51,803 --> 01:02:52,758
What?

960
01:02:52,963 --> 01:02:53,759
Raw!

961
01:02:53,923 --> 01:02:54,912
Raw?

962
01:02:56,923 --> 01:02:57,878
Rare?

963
01:02:58,243 --> 01:02:59,358
Rare.

964
01:03:03,323 --> 01:03:04,915
And how about to drink?

965
01:03:06,363 --> 01:03:07,273
Beer.

966
01:03:07,483 --> 01:03:08,916
Another beer.

967
01:03:09,883 --> 01:03:11,316
You talk funny.

968
01:03:13,883 --> 01:03:16,272
You got any company
while you're in town?

969
01:03:19,163 --> 01:03:20,482
Hey, Antoinette!

970
01:03:20,763 --> 01:03:21,832
Come here.

971
01:03:25,283 --> 01:03:26,955
This here's a good friend of ours.

972
01:03:27,043 --> 01:03:28,920
Kansas City Little Big Mickey Blue Eyes.

973
01:03:29,003 --> 01:03:30,755
Well, that's a mouthful.

974
01:03:31,243 --> 01:03:33,473
Sit down. Say hi to the nice man.

975
01:03:36,083 --> 01:03:37,072
Hi.

976
01:03:38,563 --> 01:03:41,919
Mickey Blue Eyes.
Why do they call you that?

977
01:03:44,603 --> 01:03:46,719
So what part of Kansas City?

978
01:03:50,363 --> 01:03:53,082
-Are they taking care of you?
-Get back in your kitchen!

979
01:03:53,163 --> 01:03:54,915
I want something, I'll ask!

980
01:04:02,843 --> 01:04:04,674
Kansas City, here I come.

981
01:04:05,723 --> 01:04:08,442
Rent GoodFellas, Casino,
Godfather l, ll, Ill....

982
01:04:08,523 --> 01:04:10,161
Jesus Christ, it talks?

983
01:04:10,243 --> 01:04:12,074
With an accent, no less.

984
01:04:12,283 --> 01:04:13,477
What is that?

985
01:04:13,563 --> 01:04:17,272
It's like a little recorder thing.
Got it off some British asshole.

986
01:04:18,043 --> 01:04:19,874
What an amazing coincidence.

987
01:04:20,643 --> 01:04:22,998
Come for one of the famous steaks?

988
01:04:24,603 --> 01:04:26,434
Is something queer going on?

989
01:04:27,083 --> 01:04:30,041
Is this in any way connected
to that FBI business?

990
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:33,241
Philip, I can't explain at the moment.

991
01:04:33,563 --> 01:04:35,872
What was going on
at the auction last night?

992
01:04:35,963 --> 01:04:39,160
Why did you keep saying "ha"?
We were worried about you.

993
01:04:39,683 --> 01:04:41,401
I'll have to explain later.

994
01:04:43,363 --> 01:04:44,682
Oh, my God! I am so sorry.

995
01:04:44,883 --> 01:04:46,111
This is all my fault.

996
01:04:46,363 --> 01:04:48,081
I can't apologize enough--

997
01:04:49,883 --> 01:04:52,477
Just a little screwup. But what the hell?

998
01:04:52,763 --> 01:04:54,355
We got it under control.

999
01:04:54,563 --> 01:04:55,916
Forget about it.

1000
01:04:56,603 --> 01:04:57,638
Why are you talking--

1001
01:04:57,723 --> 01:05:00,157
Shut up, asshole! I had enough a you!

1002
01:05:00,323 --> 01:05:02,791
I said shut up! Get outta here!

1003
01:05:03,003 --> 01:05:04,561
All you British are the same!

1004
01:05:04,643 --> 01:05:07,157
You're all assholes!
Go on! Get outta here!

1005
01:05:14,323 --> 01:05:15,358
Asshole.

1006
01:05:20,723 --> 01:05:22,998
-What are they doing?
-Talking to Kansas City.

1007
01:05:23,083 --> 01:05:26,075
They can't connect us to Johnny
if I get to the old lady first.

1008
01:05:26,163 --> 01:05:30,395
But she spends her afternoons
playing cards and comes home about 3:00.

1009
01:05:32,283 --> 01:05:34,353
What? What?

1010
01:05:35,203 --> 01:05:37,034
I missed meeting Gina for lunch.

1011
01:05:37,123 --> 01:05:40,399
Give her a call. Explain what happened.
It'll be okay.

1012
01:05:40,643 --> 01:05:43,077
Just wake up, Frank. It will not be okay!

1013
01:05:43,163 --> 01:05:47,361
I assaulted my boss, lost my fiancée,
and your pals are going to kill me!

1014
01:05:47,763 --> 01:05:51,358
Of all the things it won't be,
"okay" pretty much tops the list.

1015
01:05:51,563 --> 01:05:53,076
You have to stay focused.

1016
01:05:53,163 --> 01:05:56,200
Focus on this. Gina won't forgive me.
Do you know why?

1017
01:05:56,443 --> 01:06:00,834
I lied to her. Her father's lied
to her all her life. And it hurts.

1018
01:06:02,923 --> 01:06:04,322
She told you that?

1019
01:06:04,483 --> 01:06:08,840
Yeah, and now it looks like I've lost
the only girl I've ever really loved.

1020
01:06:09,043 --> 01:06:12,274
As far as I'm concerned,
it's not bloody "okay" at all.

1021
01:06:18,283 --> 01:06:19,796
You can't go home.

1022
01:06:21,243 --> 01:06:22,596
I'm going to Gina's.

1023
01:06:29,323 --> 01:06:32,042
I should've told you everything
from the start.

1024
01:06:32,283 --> 01:06:35,719
But the whole thing snowballed,
and before I knew where I was...

1025
01:06:35,963 --> 01:06:39,160
...l was just buried in the whole thing.

1026
01:06:39,363 --> 01:06:40,955
But everything I did...

1027
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:43,233
...l did out of fear of losing you.

1028
01:06:43,963 --> 01:06:47,239
Listen. Please just let me come up.
This is ridiculous.

1029
01:06:47,683 --> 01:06:50,072
Why didn't you show up for lunch today?

1030
01:06:50,523 --> 01:06:51,956
The truth, please.

1031
01:06:52,163 --> 01:06:55,712
I was with your father.
We had to have lunch with these people.

1032
01:06:55,963 --> 01:06:57,078
It was a nightmare.

1033
01:06:57,163 --> 01:07:00,155
It seems like you and Dad
are getting pretty close.

1034
01:07:02,723 --> 01:07:04,202
What does that mean?

1035
01:07:04,643 --> 01:07:08,158
It means we're over, Michael.
I just don't know who you are.

1036
01:07:15,403 --> 01:07:16,916
You're toast.

1037
01:07:25,603 --> 01:07:27,195
-Come here.
-What?

1038
01:07:27,363 --> 01:07:28,716
Don't worry about it.

1039
01:07:28,803 --> 01:07:30,236
It'll be okay.

1040
01:07:32,483 --> 01:07:34,041
Come on!

1041
01:07:34,883 --> 01:07:36,794
Thanks, Jimmy. Thanks.

1042
01:08:09,123 --> 01:08:11,000
She went out, Frankie.

1043
01:08:17,763 --> 01:08:19,515
Michael...

1044
01:08:20,843 --> 01:08:23,403
...fired a warning shot in the ceiling.

1045
01:08:25,083 --> 01:08:26,516
It was an accident.

1046
01:08:27,803 --> 01:08:29,395
Sit down, Frank.

1047
01:08:33,563 --> 01:08:36,282
Having the best time. It's a wonderful city.

1048
01:08:36,483 --> 01:08:40,476
Everyone's so courteous! I don't know
why they talk about New Yorkers--

1049
01:08:40,683 --> 01:08:42,753
Get the hell out of here! Go on!

1050
01:08:51,163 --> 01:08:53,723
Get out of the apartment right now.
Just go.

1051
01:08:55,203 --> 01:08:56,875
What's going on? What's happening?

1052
01:08:56,963 --> 01:08:58,919
Vito thinks the Risollis killed Johnny.

1053
01:08:59,003 --> 01:09:01,312
Things are a little dicey right now.

1054
01:09:01,563 --> 01:09:02,837
I'm fine.

1055
01:09:03,483 --> 01:09:06,714
Vito was worried so he sent Uncle Vinnie
to watch out for me.

1056
01:09:06,803 --> 01:09:08,441
Isn't that sweet of him?

1057
01:09:09,403 --> 01:09:10,358
Daddy?

1058
01:09:11,043 --> 01:09:12,192
You there?

1059
01:09:13,283 --> 01:09:14,682
Okay, listen to me.

1060
01:09:15,323 --> 01:09:18,156
Whatever you do,
I can't explain this right now...

1061
01:09:18,363 --> 01:09:21,719
...but don't tell anyone there's trouble
between you and Michael.

1062
01:09:21,803 --> 01:09:24,522
It's very, very important. You understand?

1063
01:09:26,203 --> 01:09:28,842
-Let me talk to Vinnie.
-Sure, one sec.

1064
01:09:29,083 --> 01:09:30,198
It's Daddy.

1065
01:09:34,043 --> 01:09:36,477
You touch one hair on her head, I swear...

1066
01:09:36,683 --> 01:09:38,002
...you'll beg me to kill you!

1067
01:09:38,083 --> 01:09:41,280
Listen, I'm just doing my job.
All right, Frank?

1068
01:09:41,523 --> 01:09:45,436
You do what you gotta do,
and everything will be okay. All right?

1069
01:09:45,643 --> 01:09:46,712
You--

1070
01:10:21,283 --> 01:10:22,398
So?

1071
01:10:27,643 --> 01:10:29,281
They know what happened.

1072
01:10:31,643 --> 01:10:33,201
They know about Gina?

1073
01:10:35,683 --> 01:10:37,241
They think it was you.

1074
01:10:39,963 --> 01:10:41,442
What's gonna happen?

1075
01:10:42,123 --> 01:10:44,318
They gotta take care of you, Michael.

1076
01:10:45,123 --> 01:10:46,602
What does that mean?

1077
01:10:47,003 --> 01:10:48,356
It means...

1078
01:10:48,603 --> 01:10:50,514
...they ordered someone to....

1079
01:10:52,643 --> 01:10:53,758
Whack me?

1080
01:10:58,163 --> 01:10:59,562
Do we know who?

1081
01:11:01,523 --> 01:11:02,512
Me.

1082
01:11:03,043 --> 01:11:03,998
You?

1083
01:11:05,643 --> 01:11:07,440
You're going to whack me?

1084
01:11:07,643 --> 01:11:10,203
Stop saying that. You sound like an idiot!

1085
01:11:12,283 --> 01:11:16,674
Vito wants me to do it at the wedding,
during your speech.

1086
01:11:17,443 --> 01:11:19,673
That way he figures he gets us both.

1087
01:11:19,883 --> 01:11:24,479
You die, and I lose Gina
by killing the man she loves.

1088
01:11:25,163 --> 01:11:27,279
But there isn't gonna be a wedding.

1089
01:11:28,483 --> 01:11:30,041
So I can't do it then.

1090
01:11:30,883 --> 01:11:33,761
You mean, you can't do it then...

1091
01:11:34,083 --> 01:11:35,755
...or you can't do it, then?

1092
01:11:37,003 --> 01:11:38,402
The first one.

1093
01:11:40,443 --> 01:11:41,398
Right.

1094
01:11:43,083 --> 01:11:46,871
They got Gina. If I don't do it,
Vinnie's gonna kill her.

1095
01:11:47,083 --> 01:11:48,038
My God!

1096
01:11:48,283 --> 01:11:52,196
It's one of these honor things, you know.
A life for a life.

1097
01:11:54,763 --> 01:11:55,991
Bottom line...

1098
01:11:57,403 --> 01:11:59,997
...Vito's not gonna rest
until he sees a body.

1099
01:12:01,763 --> 01:12:03,958
A body. Right.

1100
01:12:23,163 --> 01:12:25,882
This is probably a stupid question, but...

1101
01:12:26,523 --> 01:12:28,753
...to your knowledge, does this hurt?

1102
01:12:30,723 --> 01:12:31,758
No.

1103
01:12:32,603 --> 01:12:34,241
You won't feel a thing.

1104
01:12:34,683 --> 01:12:35,672
Ready?

1105
01:12:36,763 --> 01:12:37,798
Ready.

1106
01:12:45,603 --> 01:12:48,913
That is surprisingly painful.
Is it meant to hurt that much?

1107
01:12:49,083 --> 01:12:50,801
Let me check that for you.

1108
01:12:52,003 --> 01:12:55,234
When Michael gets up
to give his bridegroom speech...

1109
01:12:55,483 --> 01:12:58,555
...you shoot him twice,
then our guys shoot you.

1110
01:12:58,723 --> 01:13:01,874
We'll stitch the squib controls
inside your tuxedos...

1111
01:13:02,083 --> 01:13:06,156
...so you gotta learn to set them off
yourselves, in sync with the gunshots.

1112
01:13:06,243 --> 01:13:07,471
Can you handle it?

1113
01:13:07,563 --> 01:13:09,633
Any problems, speak now.

1114
01:13:10,283 --> 01:13:12,558
This thing is potentially huge for us.

1115
01:13:12,683 --> 01:13:13,877
Massive.

1116
01:13:14,843 --> 01:13:16,879
Questions? Worries?
Something you need?

1117
01:13:16,963 --> 01:13:18,715
Well, just one thing.

1118
01:13:19,563 --> 01:13:20,552
The bride.

1119
01:13:20,643 --> 01:13:22,122
We don't take bribes!

1120
01:13:22,203 --> 01:13:23,431
-Bride!
-Pardon?

1121
01:13:23,643 --> 01:13:25,793
-Bride!
-Take them goddamn things off your head!

1122
01:13:25,883 --> 01:13:26,918
Yes, sir!

1123
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:29,712
The Handy Bundler
is virtually indestructible!

1124
01:13:29,803 --> 01:13:32,761
Even the law can use Handy Bundler
to detain criminals.

1125
01:13:32,843 --> 01:13:35,915
You'll find hundreds of uses
for the Handy Bundler...

1126
01:13:36,123 --> 01:13:39,354
...at home, in the office and on thejob.

1127
01:13:46,403 --> 01:13:49,156
These guys are doing the flowers
for the wedding?

1128
01:13:49,243 --> 01:13:51,393
Yeah. They're supposed to be great.

1129
01:13:51,483 --> 01:13:54,714
Thanks. I think I'll be safe
with Michael inside.

1130
01:14:15,363 --> 01:14:16,591
What's going on?

1131
01:14:16,683 --> 01:14:19,151
They don't know anything at all about you.

1132
01:14:20,123 --> 01:14:22,591
-They think I shot Johnny.
-But you didn't!

1133
01:14:22,683 --> 01:14:24,275
Act like you're in love.

1134
01:14:25,163 --> 01:14:26,278
Who are you?

1135
01:14:26,363 --> 01:14:29,116
FBl. How are you today?

1136
01:14:29,323 --> 01:14:30,961
Vito doesn't know that I know this...

1137
01:14:31,043 --> 01:14:34,240
...but your father has orders to kill me
at our wedding reception.

1138
01:14:34,323 --> 01:14:36,393
-Michael will be wearing a wire.
-What?

1139
01:14:36,603 --> 01:14:40,915
Vito won't be afraid to talk
because he thinks I'm about to die.

1140
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:43,122
When he incriminates himself--

1141
01:14:43,203 --> 01:14:45,592
Our guys come in. Bingo! Got him.

1142
01:14:47,803 --> 01:14:49,441
And that's the end of it.

1143
01:14:51,163 --> 01:14:53,358
You think I'd help trap my own father?

1144
01:14:53,443 --> 01:14:55,240
Your father is with us.

1145
01:14:55,883 --> 01:14:58,522
You're more important to him
than they are.

1146
01:14:58,963 --> 01:15:01,079
It's our only way out of this alive.

1147
01:15:04,643 --> 01:15:06,759
Then I guess I don't have a choice.

1148
01:15:07,683 --> 01:15:09,082
Everything okay?

1149
01:15:09,563 --> 01:15:11,997
Everything's fine. Decisions, you know?

1150
01:15:12,803 --> 01:15:14,361
I think we're through.

1151
01:15:15,523 --> 01:15:20,199
Excuse me! Any panics, any questions,
you just give us a call.

1152
01:15:20,443 --> 01:15:23,037
"Tony and Guy, don't be shy."

1153
01:15:23,563 --> 01:15:24,837
'Bye then, darling.

1154
01:15:24,923 --> 01:15:26,197
See you later.

1155
01:15:33,883 --> 01:15:37,193
I can't do this! We have to tell her
Frank will pretend to shoot me.

1156
01:15:37,283 --> 01:15:40,912
No way. Her reaction is everything.
It has to be real.

1157
01:16:07,003 --> 01:16:08,482
Kitchen team moving.

1158
01:16:09,323 --> 01:16:10,995
Bridal limo en route.

1159
01:16:11,203 --> 01:16:14,354
Good. Okay, gentlemen,
the limo is on its way.

1160
01:16:14,563 --> 01:16:18,556
These are the squibs. Two controllers,
one in each pocket.

1161
01:16:18,763 --> 01:16:23,518
Now, a squeeze or a sharp tap
sets them off. Do you understand?

1162
01:16:24,443 --> 01:16:27,196
How do you do? I'm the best man.

1163
01:16:27,403 --> 01:16:30,395
Hello. My name's Peter. I'm the best man.

1164
01:16:30,563 --> 01:16:33,760
I work at Mark and Spencer's.
I love chocolate biscuits.

1165
01:16:33,923 --> 01:16:36,357
Oh, Mumsy, I want some ginger beer!

1166
01:16:41,603 --> 01:16:43,195
Here she is!

1167
01:16:43,883 --> 01:16:46,443
Here's the bride! Hi, pretty!

1168
01:16:46,683 --> 01:16:48,162
Oh, my God!

1169
01:16:52,763 --> 01:16:55,152
Not much of a job though, is it, Vinnie?

1170
01:17:03,483 --> 01:17:05,075
Thank you so much.

1171
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:10,402
My leg!

1172
01:17:15,523 --> 01:17:18,356
Testing, one, two, three. Do you read?

1173
01:17:18,603 --> 01:17:22,232
Testing, one, two, three.
Do you read? Do you read?

1174
01:17:22,443 --> 01:17:24,957
Remember, we'll need Graziosi
loud and clear.

1175
01:17:25,123 --> 01:17:27,398
-You got lots of time.
-Only until the speeches.

1176
01:17:27,483 --> 01:17:29,201
Right. After the dancing and dessert.

1177
01:17:29,283 --> 01:17:32,958
This is an ltalian wedding.
The speeches are before the dinner.

1178
01:17:33,203 --> 01:17:34,682
You knew that, right?

1179
01:17:36,323 --> 01:17:37,802
You still got plenty of time.

1180
01:17:37,883 --> 01:17:41,319
Plenty of time?
You have 10 minutes if you're lucky!

1181
01:17:42,243 --> 01:17:45,155
This is not a problem. Gonna be okay.

1182
01:17:46,403 --> 01:17:47,802
We have a problem.

1183
01:17:51,003 --> 01:17:53,153
"And Michael Andrew Felgate...

1184
01:17:53,403 --> 01:17:57,442
"...do you take Gina Maria Vitale
for your lawful wife...

1185
01:17:57,723 --> 01:17:59,395
"...to have and to hold...

1186
01:17:59,683 --> 01:18:02,834
"...from this day forward,
for better, for worse...

1187
01:18:03,043 --> 01:18:04,920
"...for richer, for poorer...

1188
01:18:05,123 --> 01:18:08,752
"...in sickness and in health,
until death do you part?"

1189
01:18:09,003 --> 01:18:10,072
I do.

1190
01:18:10,523 --> 01:18:13,242
"You have declared your consent
before the Church.

1191
01:18:13,443 --> 01:18:15,399
"May the Lord in His goodness...

1192
01:18:15,483 --> 01:18:19,192
"...strengthen your consent
and fill you both with His blessings.

1193
01:18:19,443 --> 01:18:20,319
"Amen.

1194
01:18:20,443 --> 01:18:24,834
"ln the name of the Father
and the Son and the Holy Spirit...

1195
01:18:25,083 --> 01:18:27,802
"...l pronounce you husband and wife."

1196
01:18:29,563 --> 01:18:31,201
You may kiss the bride.

1197
01:18:47,163 --> 01:18:49,233
Hey! Wedding! Smile!

1198
01:18:50,403 --> 01:18:51,836
Wedding!

1199
01:18:53,443 --> 01:18:55,593
Kitchen team, we've got one shot at this.

1200
01:18:55,683 --> 01:18:58,117
And less than five minutes
before the speeches.

1201
01:18:58,203 --> 01:18:59,397
We got it.

1202
01:19:00,163 --> 01:19:01,312
About the other day--

1203
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:04,236
I don't want to hear.
I'm sure you had your reasons.

1204
01:19:04,323 --> 01:19:07,076
No names, no pack drill. That's my motto.

1205
01:19:07,323 --> 01:19:09,154
That's incredibly nice of you.

1206
01:19:09,243 --> 01:19:11,199
Goodness, are you drinking?

1207
01:19:11,843 --> 01:19:13,834
-Come on, darling.
-I've only had one glass.

1208
01:19:13,923 --> 01:19:15,754
-Let me take that.
-She thinks I'm drunk!

1209
01:19:15,843 --> 01:19:17,959
You're very embarrassing
when you're drunk.

1210
01:19:23,403 --> 01:19:24,961
I think you're on now.

1211
01:19:32,043 --> 01:19:33,442
In position.

1212
01:19:34,243 --> 01:19:38,395
I just wanted to say how sorry I am
about your son.

1213
01:19:39,323 --> 01:19:40,551
Thank you.

1214
01:19:42,523 --> 01:19:44,161
This is a happy day.

1215
01:19:44,483 --> 01:19:46,041
I wish you much joy.

1216
01:19:46,883 --> 01:19:49,602
I especially look forward to the speeches.

1217
01:19:53,603 --> 01:19:56,481
You're very kind,
and I appreciate the way you've...

1218
01:19:57,403 --> 01:19:59,598
...opened my eyes to new possibilities.

1219
01:19:59,683 --> 01:20:01,275
As a matter of fact...

1220
01:20:01,563 --> 01:20:04,396
...l recently thought of a new idea
that I think...

1221
01:20:04,803 --> 01:20:06,873
...could be profitable to us both.

1222
01:20:08,923 --> 01:20:10,754
Absurdly profitable, really.

1223
01:20:11,203 --> 01:20:13,114
I mean, we're talking millions.

1224
01:20:15,483 --> 01:20:18,361
But this isn't the occasion
to be talking business.

1225
01:20:18,523 --> 01:20:19,956
Another time perhaps.

1226
01:20:20,043 --> 01:20:22,113
Thank you so much for being here.

1227
01:20:23,163 --> 01:20:24,357
He's lost his mind.

1228
01:20:24,443 --> 01:20:27,003
And speeches in 04:05.

1229
01:20:28,683 --> 01:20:30,162
Are you out of your mind?

1230
01:20:30,243 --> 01:20:32,074
-He wasn't ready. Relax.
-Relax?

1231
01:20:32,163 --> 01:20:33,596
Congratulations!

1232
01:20:35,323 --> 01:20:37,917
In five minutes, we're dead.
You, me and Gina.

1233
01:20:38,203 --> 01:20:39,682
Never chase the bid.

1234
01:20:39,803 --> 01:20:40,713
What?

1235
01:20:40,923 --> 01:20:43,118
Let the bid come to you.
It's rule number one.

1236
01:20:43,203 --> 01:20:45,353
What the hell are you talking about?

1237
01:20:45,603 --> 01:20:48,037
Mr. Graziosi wants to see you over there.

1238
01:20:48,323 --> 01:20:50,075
Of course. A pleasure.

1239
01:20:53,243 --> 01:20:55,598
I think we're in business.

1240
01:20:55,803 --> 01:20:56,918
Speeches in three.

1241
01:20:59,683 --> 01:21:02,072
We have to go say hi to Maria.

1242
01:21:05,723 --> 01:21:10,080
So basically you continue to sell
and buy interesting work through us...

1243
01:21:11,003 --> 01:21:14,040
...and I do the insurance valuation
on the collection.

1244
01:21:14,443 --> 01:21:17,799
Like insurance against a fire, for example.

1245
01:21:18,563 --> 01:21:20,235
Fires can happen.

1246
01:21:20,443 --> 01:21:21,876
Look at Sotheby's.

1247
01:21:24,163 --> 01:21:27,951
But fortunately, of course,
you would be handsomely covered.

1248
01:21:29,283 --> 01:21:30,682
What do you think?

1249
01:21:35,043 --> 01:21:36,601
Are we in business?

1250
01:21:38,923 --> 01:21:40,356
-Say it!
-In two.

1251
01:21:42,283 --> 01:21:43,875
Michael! There you are!

1252
01:21:45,283 --> 01:21:46,636
You look serious.

1253
01:21:47,003 --> 01:21:48,038
Cheer up!

1254
01:21:48,163 --> 01:21:50,472
Those are quite something. Mind if l--

1255
01:21:50,603 --> 01:21:52,753
-Take it easy.
-It's quite all right.

1256
01:21:55,363 --> 01:21:56,762
What do you think?

1257
01:21:56,843 --> 01:21:59,516
Philip, this is Uncle Vito.

1258
01:21:59,723 --> 01:22:00,792
Delighted to meet you.

1259
01:22:00,883 --> 01:22:02,521
You from the old country?

1260
01:22:04,963 --> 01:22:06,601
My family's from Sicily.

1261
01:22:08,803 --> 01:22:10,156
Land of the goat.

1262
01:22:10,243 --> 01:22:12,711
My wife and I spent
a wonderful week there.

1263
01:22:12,803 --> 01:22:16,000
Charming little pensione
with a priceless little owner...

1264
01:22:16,163 --> 01:22:17,801
...who looked just like a Mafiosi.

1265
01:22:17,883 --> 01:22:20,317
We called him AI Capone.
Remember, darling?

1266
01:22:22,043 --> 01:22:24,159
These things are making me squiffy!

1267
01:22:25,643 --> 01:22:27,838
Thank you. Excuse me.

1268
01:22:29,723 --> 01:22:31,281
I'm sorry, Philip. Uncle Vito!

1269
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:34,480
I am a ninny!
I forgot to tell you the good news.

1270
01:22:34,683 --> 01:22:38,676
Mr. Morganson here has decided
Cromwell's are the team for him.

1271
01:22:41,763 --> 01:22:43,082
That's marvelous news.

1272
01:22:43,163 --> 01:22:45,074
We must meet and discuss the details.

1273
01:22:45,163 --> 01:22:47,518
Let me just find my--

1274
01:22:54,403 --> 01:22:57,713
I'll have Helen leave a message on Monday.
Excuse me.

1275
01:22:58,843 --> 01:23:02,802
What a horrible thing to happen.
I'm sure he meant it as a joke.

1276
01:23:03,003 --> 01:23:05,437
Could I borrow him for a second? Thanks.

1277
01:23:07,363 --> 01:23:10,400
That was quite something.
I love party tricks.

1278
01:23:11,963 --> 01:23:15,638
Pray gather round
from the farthest reaches!

1279
01:23:16,323 --> 01:23:17,881
And take your seats...

1280
01:23:18,443 --> 01:23:20,877
...to hear the speeches!

1281
01:23:20,963 --> 01:23:22,874
And the speeches are early.

1282
01:23:28,283 --> 01:23:30,353
Listen, I swear to God I'll do it.

1283
01:23:30,963 --> 01:23:35,002
I'm begging you, for Gina's sake,
let me wait till the party's over.

1284
01:23:35,283 --> 01:23:38,241
During the speeches. For Gina's sake.

1285
01:23:44,043 --> 01:23:45,362
Please, we have to hurry.

1286
01:23:45,443 --> 01:23:48,799
I'm going as fast as I can,
but it's rather a mess.

1287
01:23:49,083 --> 01:23:51,597
Turn around. I need to tuck it in properly.

1288
01:23:54,083 --> 01:23:56,392
English. Figured as much.

1289
01:23:56,883 --> 01:24:00,762
Just shove it in there. Shove it in there!
God! No, stuff it in!

1290
01:24:02,523 --> 01:24:03,956
Give me your gun.

1291
01:24:05,723 --> 01:24:07,634
Give me your gun, Frank.

1292
01:24:14,683 --> 01:24:15,877
Johnny's.

1293
01:24:16,283 --> 01:24:20,162
His first. I want you to use this one.

1294
01:24:23,203 --> 01:24:24,875
I think he gave Frank a live gun.

1295
01:24:24,963 --> 01:24:27,079
-I suggest abort. I repeat, abort!
-No!

1296
01:24:27,683 --> 01:24:30,117
We can still get this. Get a mike in there.

1297
01:24:30,203 --> 01:24:33,718
Kitchen team, get into position,
but nobody goes in until I say so.

1298
01:24:33,803 --> 01:24:34,952
-Sir.
-Shut up!

1299
01:24:35,043 --> 01:24:36,317
Copy that.

1300
01:24:40,763 --> 01:24:43,038
Best man. How do you do?

1301
01:24:43,363 --> 01:24:46,912
Excuse me, but I rather think
you're wilting there, old boy.

1302
01:24:47,163 --> 01:24:48,516
There we are.

1303
01:24:48,603 --> 01:24:50,275
There we are.

1304
01:24:51,483 --> 01:24:52,677
Welcome back.

1305
01:24:54,843 --> 01:24:55,912
See you later, then.

1306
01:24:56,003 --> 01:24:57,914
Ladies and gentlemen...

1307
01:24:58,003 --> 01:25:01,313
...perhaps you'd like to give a big hand...

1308
01:25:01,603 --> 01:25:04,037
...to Gina and Mike!

1309
01:25:12,963 --> 01:25:15,636
You gotta get in here. It's too late.
He's gonna die.

1310
01:25:16,163 --> 01:25:18,631
No. This has been nine years.
Kitchen team.

1311
01:25:18,843 --> 01:25:19,992
Standing by.

1312
01:25:20,123 --> 01:25:21,442
Wait for my word.

1313
01:25:33,163 --> 01:25:36,041
We still got a chance. Frank's got a mike.

1314
01:25:36,283 --> 01:25:37,272
But....

1315
01:25:38,003 --> 01:25:38,958
What?

1316
01:25:39,963 --> 01:25:41,760
Vito gave him a live gun.

1317
01:25:46,403 --> 01:25:47,916
All right. All right.

1318
01:25:48,123 --> 01:25:51,479
Now, can your clapping,
'cause here's you know whom:

1319
01:25:51,603 --> 01:25:54,322
My new brother and our bridegroom.

1320
01:25:54,523 --> 01:25:56,275
All right. Come on.

1321
01:25:56,363 --> 01:25:58,513
Mikey, we're waiting!

1322
01:25:59,323 --> 01:26:00,881
We're waiting, Mikey!

1323
01:26:01,083 --> 01:26:04,280
You're getting married. Thattaboy!

1324
01:26:16,723 --> 01:26:17,758
Speak up!

1325
01:26:19,123 --> 01:26:20,397
Sorry.

1326
01:26:22,443 --> 01:26:24,001
This is making me nervous.

1327
01:26:24,083 --> 01:26:26,153
The last time I spoke at a wedding...

1328
01:26:26,243 --> 01:26:29,315
...l was supposed to propose a toast
to the bridesmaids.

1329
01:26:29,443 --> 01:26:31,593
I ended up proposing an opening bid.

1330
01:26:31,683 --> 01:26:33,639
What's worse is they both sold.

1331
01:26:34,563 --> 01:26:36,235
Want it in the head or the chest?

1332
01:26:36,323 --> 01:26:38,553
Come on. Come on!

1333
01:26:41,283 --> 01:26:43,353
-So I'll keep it simple.
-Good idea!

1334
01:26:43,443 --> 01:26:47,197
Andjust tell you why I think today,
for once...

1335
01:26:47,603 --> 01:26:50,037
...l'm the one acquiring the masterpiece.

1336
01:26:52,323 --> 01:26:55,679
Firstly, I've always been a huge fan
of the ltalian school.

1337
01:26:58,963 --> 01:27:00,476
Come on, speak to me.

1338
01:27:01,843 --> 01:27:03,196
It's not working.

1339
01:27:04,243 --> 01:27:08,600
They say that the real test
of a masterpiece...

1340
01:27:08,923 --> 01:27:11,756
...is whether you instinctively know
it's something...

1341
01:27:12,163 --> 01:27:13,835
...you'll keep forever...

1342
01:27:14,283 --> 01:27:15,716
...love forever.

1343
01:27:19,203 --> 01:27:21,592
Don't think of it as gaining a son.

1344
01:27:21,763 --> 01:27:23,242
Ifyou don't do it...

1345
01:27:23,323 --> 01:27:24,676
...you're losing a daughter.

1346
01:27:24,763 --> 01:27:26,719
-Sir?
-No good.

1347
01:27:28,643 --> 01:27:30,235
In some cases....

1348
01:27:31,083 --> 01:27:32,755
In some cases...

1349
01:27:32,963 --> 01:27:36,797
...it's even something you'd be prepared
to die to protect.

1350
01:27:38,603 --> 01:27:40,434
That's certainly the case here.

1351
01:27:40,643 --> 01:27:43,203
I'd rather die than see any harm
come to Gina.

1352
01:27:44,123 --> 01:27:46,512
I love her more than my own life.

1353
01:27:48,323 --> 01:27:52,316
And I hope I'm making myself crystal clear
on that point.

1354
01:27:54,123 --> 01:27:55,351
Death...

1355
01:27:55,643 --> 01:27:57,440
...is okay by me.

1356
01:28:01,443 --> 01:28:04,480
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the fa ther of the bride.

1357
01:28:11,003 --> 01:28:13,119
For chrissakes, Bob, this is it.

1358
01:28:13,283 --> 01:28:15,239
Damn it! Kitchen team, go!

1359
01:28:27,203 --> 01:28:29,717
Excuse me! FBl!

1360
01:28:50,443 --> 01:28:52,001
It's bullshit!

1361
01:28:52,483 --> 01:28:53,438
Do it!

1362
01:28:53,843 --> 01:28:54,719
-Do it!
-No!

1363
01:28:55,883 --> 01:28:57,475
-Vinnie, do it!
-Vinnie, no!

1364
01:28:58,363 --> 01:28:59,955
Do it! Do it!

1365
01:29:00,043 --> 01:29:00,919
No.

1366
01:29:01,123 --> 01:29:02,397
Vinnie, do it!

1367
01:29:02,923 --> 01:29:04,436
I'm ordering you! Kill her!

1368
01:29:04,523 --> 01:29:06,036
Yes! Got him!

1369
01:29:07,043 --> 01:29:09,238
FBl! Freeze!

1370
01:29:11,083 --> 01:29:11,913
No!

1371
01:29:22,763 --> 01:29:24,435
Ambulance, now!

1372
01:29:24,643 --> 01:29:25,837
It's too late!

1373
01:29:54,723 --> 01:29:56,520
Let's go! The party's over!

1374
01:30:03,843 --> 01:30:05,401
-On three.
-I'm ready!

1375
01:30:26,243 --> 01:30:27,801
I'm sorry.

1376
01:30:28,123 --> 01:30:30,000
-I'm so sorry.
-No, I'm sorry.

1377
01:30:31,643 --> 01:30:33,918
You should both be sorry.

1378
01:30:37,083 --> 01:30:39,358
These things are surprisingly painful.

1379
01:30:39,843 --> 01:30:40,673
My God!

1380
01:30:40,803 --> 01:30:42,714
It's a new rule of mine:

1381
01:30:42,883 --> 01:30:45,477
Always assume you guys
are hiding something.

1382
01:30:46,963 --> 01:30:47,759
Why--

1383
01:30:47,883 --> 01:30:51,842
When I thought of you with a gun,
Michael, suddenly I wanted a backup.

1384
01:30:52,043 --> 01:30:53,396
You did good.

1385
01:30:57,283 --> 01:30:58,352
Oh, my God!

1386
01:30:58,723 --> 01:30:59,917
I'll tell you, Frank...

1387
01:31:00,003 --> 01:31:02,801
...her father might act
like a moron sometimes....

1388
01:31:04,803 --> 01:31:05,952
So I retired.

1389
01:31:06,363 --> 01:31:07,591
I'm telling you, Frankie...

1390
01:31:07,683 --> 01:31:09,082
...the kid's a genius.

1391
01:31:09,163 --> 01:31:10,596
I mean, think about it.

1392
01:31:10,683 --> 01:31:13,436
You got Vito.
Vito thinks he got his revenge.

1393
01:31:13,803 --> 01:31:16,795
And that's it. Badda-bing. You're even.

1394
01:31:17,083 --> 01:31:19,358
You're in the clear. All of you.

1395
01:31:19,523 --> 01:31:22,754
-How the hell could you do this to me?
-You were gonna do it to me.

1396
01:31:22,843 --> 01:31:25,198
-We did it because we love you.
-Same here.

1397
01:31:25,403 --> 01:31:26,392
What?

1398
01:31:26,603 --> 01:31:28,798
You love both of us?

1399
01:31:32,923 --> 01:31:34,641
I don't think so, Michael.

1400
01:31:37,883 --> 01:31:38,793
Oh, my God.

1401
01:31:38,883 --> 01:31:40,953
-Wasn't that the--
-Oh, my God!

1402
01:31:42,403 --> 01:31:44,234
Welcome to the halfway point...

1403
01:31:44,323 --> 01:31:48,032
...in the annual Central Park
Senior Marathon.

1404
01:31:51,683 --> 01:31:54,277
-Leave me alone!
-Wait! Listen. Listen!

1405
01:31:54,523 --> 01:31:56,479
This picture, it isn't me.

1406
01:31:56,683 --> 01:31:59,322
It's Kansas City Little
Big Mickey Blue Eyes!

1407
01:31:59,523 --> 01:32:02,321
I was pretending to be a mobster,
and couldn't say my R's...

1408
01:32:02,403 --> 01:32:05,281
...and I had to kiss the waitress
or they would've killed us!

1409
01:32:05,363 --> 01:32:07,035
Look who's sitting next to me.

1410
01:32:08,363 --> 01:32:09,921
Recognize that suit?

1411
01:32:10,523 --> 01:32:11,717
Is that Dad?

1412
01:32:11,963 --> 01:32:14,079
This photo means nothing.

1413
01:32:16,643 --> 01:32:18,713
-So who's Mickey Blue Eyes?
-I am.

1414
01:32:19,243 --> 01:32:21,996
I mean, I was. We just made him up.

1415
01:32:22,203 --> 01:32:24,114
Come back and I'll explain everything.

1416
01:32:24,203 --> 01:32:27,878
So when you said you were
with my dad that day, you were--

1417
01:32:28,123 --> 01:32:30,193
I was telling the truth.

1418
01:32:32,123 --> 01:32:35,081
-You told me a lot of other lies.
-I know.

1419
01:32:35,323 --> 01:32:39,236
I know. I thought it was the only way
to keep you.

1420
01:32:39,723 --> 01:32:41,156
But you were right.

1421
01:32:41,443 --> 01:32:43,638
It was the only sure way to lose you.

1422
01:32:49,643 --> 01:32:51,679
-I was right.
-You were.

1423
01:32:51,843 --> 01:32:54,403
-And smarter than you all along.
-Yes.

1424
01:32:54,923 --> 01:32:56,993
-And braver.
-Much.

1425
01:32:57,723 --> 01:32:59,475
And more convincing at being shot.

1426
01:32:59,683 --> 01:33:00,911
Infinitely.

1427
01:33:03,083 --> 01:33:04,516
Marry me, Gina.

1428
01:33:07,043 --> 01:33:09,273
Would I have to be Mrs. Blue Eyes?

1429
01:33:11,243 --> 01:33:12,392
Come here....

1430
01:33:13,163 --> 01:33:14,118
What?

1431
01:33:14,563 --> 01:33:15,712
Come here.

1432
01:33:17,123 --> 01:33:18,556
-What?
-It's me.

1433
01:33:18,643 --> 01:33:20,474
Mickey Blue.

1434
01:33:21,643 --> 01:33:22,792
Oh, please!
