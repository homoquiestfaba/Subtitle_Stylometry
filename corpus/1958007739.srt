1
00:00:02,712 --> 00:00:04,469
(mellow music)

2
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:09,249
<i> - I have this dream,</i>
<i> I lie in sombre.</i>

3
00:00:09,367 --> 00:00:11,301
<i> Water surrounds me.</i>

4
00:00:13,264 --> 00:00:16,298
<i> I breathe no longer.</i>

5
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:20,394
<i> Death approaches,</i>
<i> extending its hand.</i>

6
00:00:20,512 --> 00:00:25,399
<i> Now a friend I did not plan.</i>

7
00:00:25,517 --> 00:00:29,494
<i>But in this dream, I never wake.</i>

8
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:32,514
<i> Tragedy now becomes my fate.</i>

9
00:00:32,575 --> 00:00:33,848
(tense music)

10
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:36,702
(muffled scream)

11
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:44,418
(woman humming)

12
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:49,465
(indistinct background chatter)

13
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:02,061
(humming continues)

14
00:01:14,492 --> 00:01:16,950
(background chatter continues)

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,876
(soft music)

16
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:32,925
Thank you.

17
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,159
- I'm so sorry.

18
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:44,144
(sniffles)

19
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:49,257
(sighs)

20
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:51,985
You want me to kick
everybody out of here?

21
00:01:52,104 --> 00:01:53,612
(chuckles)

22
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:01,954
How about I get
this little guy to bed?

23
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:07,092
- Yeah.

24
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:08,961
(sighs)

25
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:13,098
(water running)

26
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,092
(dishes clattering)

27
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:25,369
- Hey... You wanna turn in?

28
00:02:25,396 --> 00:02:27,604
I can finish the rest.

29
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:34,544
- What am I supposed to do now?

30
00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:36,955
This wasn't supposed to happen.

31
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:38,640
(sniffles)

32
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:41,142
I can't do this.

33
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:44,388
(sobs)

34
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:46,890
- Look at me. Yes, you can.

35
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:49,117
- No, I can't.
- I'm gonna be here.

36
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:51,228
For you and tyson.

37
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:53,213
And I will always be here.

38
00:02:53,332 --> 00:02:54,564
Do you hear me?
I promise you.

39
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,975
You're my best friend.

40
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:59,403
- Okay.

41
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,238
(sobs)

42
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:03,331
I know.

43
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:05,726
(sobs)

44
00:03:05,844 --> 00:03:08,061
I got you. I got you.

45
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:14,976
I know.

46
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:16,528
I know.

47
00:03:19,191 --> 00:03:22,117
(eerie music)

48
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:55,400
(sighs)

49
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,572
(soft music)

50
00:04:04,361 --> 00:04:06,227
(sighs)

51
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:08,896
- Sun.

52
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,749
Spun.

53
00:04:13,412 --> 00:04:16,888
Fun.

54
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,967
Autumn.

55
00:04:20,085 --> 00:04:22,319
(water running)
ah, it smells so good!

56
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:25,472
- Coffee's ready!
- Ah, I can't wait.

57
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:29,250
- Ooh! Did you write
anything good this morning?

58
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,994
- Maybe.

59
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,163
- Well, can I read it?
- No.

60
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,149
- And what is the point
of poetry
if you're not gonna share it?

61
00:04:36,268 --> 00:04:38,652
- This isn't just poetry,
it's my journal,

62
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,413
And I'm just... Not ready to...

63
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:46,326
Lori, I told you, you don't need
to pay me rent.

64
00:04:46,445 --> 00:04:47,995
You stayed.

65
00:04:48,113 --> 00:04:49,904
- Oh, stop.

66
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,498
- You do this every month.

67
00:04:51,616 --> 00:04:54,042
- Yeah, and every month, I win.

68
00:04:56,455 --> 00:05:01,766
Come on, just let me contribute
until I find my own family.

69
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:04,269
Speaking of, it's grocery day,

70
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:06,604
So if you want anything special,
just let me know.

71
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:08,698
- Pancakes, always.

72
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:10,124
- Yes, that's a given.

73
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:12,702
- Also, would you mind
running by the bank for me?

74
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,679
I need tyson's birth certificate
for his passport.

75
00:05:14,798 --> 00:05:16,172
- Yeah, of course.

76
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,450
Oh, did you decide
where you guys are gonna go?

77
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:20,785
- No, but we need to go
somewhere.

78
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:24,031
Like an adventure.

79
00:05:24,149 --> 00:05:28,960
If tom were here, he would've
taken him somewhere.

80
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:32,055
- Somewhere amazing, I know.

81
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,390
- Yeah.

82
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:35,542
(gasps)

83
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:39,954
There he is! The little slugger.
- Tyson! Tyson! Tyson!

84
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:42,307
- Guys, it's just a game.

85
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:44,885
- Just a game? What?

86
00:05:45,003 --> 00:05:46,403
This is the season opener!

87
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,830
(joyfully exclaims)

88
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:51,908
- Look at that.

89
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,743
- Thanks, lori.
- Hey!

90
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:56,563
Why don't we hit the cages
one more time
before the big game?

91
00:05:56,681 --> 00:05:58,081
- Yes, please.

92
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:59,733
- Yes.

93
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,512
(intriguing music)

94
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:06,740
(cheers)

95
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:12,746
(laughter)

96
00:06:17,327 --> 00:06:18,818
(cheering)

97
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,937
- Yes! Tyson!

98
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:24,716
(cheers, applause)

99
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,706
Tyson!

100
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:33,842
Oh, I'm sorry.

101
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,436
(cheers, applause)

102
00:06:39,683 --> 00:06:44,778
- Yes, tyson! Come on!

103
00:06:44,896 --> 00:06:46,454
- Hi!
- Hi.

104
00:06:46,456 --> 00:06:49,449
- Can I get a hot dog, please?
- A hot dog, please.

105
00:06:49,568 --> 00:06:52,627
- That's your boy, right?
- Yep.

106
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:56,306
- He's a fine hitter.
- Thanks. He loves the game.

107
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,199
- You know, hitting a baseball

108
00:06:58,318 --> 00:07:00,127
Is one of the hardest things
to do in sports.

109
00:07:00,245 --> 00:07:02,537
You ever think about getting him
on a travel league?

110
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,239
- Oh, um, no, not really.

111
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,484
- You gotta get
through try-outs,

112
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:09,469
But it opens up possibilities.

113
00:07:09,588 --> 00:07:12,639
Colleges, scholarships.

114
00:07:12,757 --> 00:07:14,975
- You think tyson could make it?

115
00:07:15,093 --> 00:07:17,902
- Well... I am the coach, so...

116
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:21,406
(laughter)

117
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:23,817
(cheers, applause)

118
00:07:27,898 --> 00:07:28,989
- Yes!

119
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:35,662
- Here's your hot dog.
- Thank you.

120
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,572
- Hey, dad.
- Hey.

121
00:07:37,732 --> 00:07:41,259
- Oh, can I have one?
- Sure.

122
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:45,079
- Ma'am, uh... Wanna go
on a date with my dad?

123
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,599
- Oh.
(laughs)

124
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:49,676
- Greg.
- What? She's cute.

125
00:07:49,794 --> 00:07:52,195
- Oh, well.
- Sorry.

126
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,956
My... My son's very forward.

127
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:58,292
- Well, he's very polite.
- Yes.

128
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:02,196
I'll get you one, okay?

129
00:08:02,198 --> 00:08:04,432
And...

130
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:08,069
...If you'd be open to it,
I'd like to see you again.

131
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:14,050
- Oh, I'm... I...
I don't know.

132
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:18,747
- Tell you what,
I'll give you my number, and...

133
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:26,229
...If you wanna call me,
I'd like that.

134
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:30,217
(soft music)

135
00:08:30,335 --> 00:08:32,402
I'm randy, by the way.

136
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,963
(voice echoing): Randy roth.

137
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:37,057
(muted background cheering)

138
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:45,582
(clears throat)

139
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:47,125
- Bye!

140
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:49,628
(laughs)
oh, my god. Oh, my god.

141
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,446
(crickets chirping)

142
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:59,020
(sighs)

143
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:00,288
Okay.

144
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:05,602
(phone ringing tone)

145
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:07,254
(clears throat)

146
00:09:07,372 --> 00:09:09,272
<i> - Hi there, you've reached</i>

147
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,165

- Yeah, I know, I... I'm lori.

161
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:52,841
Come on in.
- Thanks.

162
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:57,395
Yeah, cindy mentioned
she had a roommate.

163
00:09:57,397 --> 00:09:59,823
- Yeah, it's an unusual
arrangement,

164
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,566
But we make it work.

165
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:03,735
- Uh-huh.

166
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:06,187
- Cindy will be right down.
- Great.

167
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:21,419
So, you two own this place
together, or...?

168
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:23,771
- Oh, actually,
this is cindy's house.

169
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:26,315
I just pay a little rent.

170
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:29,927
- Hmm, she must have
a really good job.

171
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:33,581
- Well, actually, her late
husband was very successful.

172
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,966
- Oh.

173
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:41,105
- Do you wanna have a drink
or anything before you go?

174
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:43,257
- Oh, I don't drink or smoke.

175
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:46,961
Single parent, don't really have
time for those kinds of things.

176
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:49,205
- And what do you do?
If you don't mind me asking?

177
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,465
- I'm a mechanic
at the perry dealership.

178
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:54,009
There she is!

179
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:55,904
- Ooh!

180
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:57,822
- You look... Wow!

181
00:10:57,941 --> 00:10:59,841
(chuckles)

182
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:02,552
- I was afraid this old thing
was devoured by moths.

183
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,145
- These are for you.

184
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:07,615
- Ah, thank you.
- You're welcome.

185
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:09,726
I'm really glad you called.

186
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:11,986
Greg was pretty happy too.

187
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:15,048
- Aww, he's a cute kid.

188
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:18,309
- Well, I will put these
in water for you.

189
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:19,685
- Thank you.

190
00:11:19,687 --> 00:11:22,472
- And you two kids have fun.
- We will.

191
00:11:22,632 --> 00:11:24,783
I'll be sure to have her home
before midnight.

192
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:26,518
(chuckles)

193
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:32,465
What kind of food do you like?

194
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:33,991
- Any food.

195
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:35,735
- Feel like italian?
- I love italian.

196
00:11:35,854 --> 00:11:38,438
- That's my specialty.

197
00:11:38,556 --> 00:11:40,907
(spy movie music on tv)

198
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:53,511
- What?

199
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:56,347
- You okay?

200
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:57,966
- Yeah.

201
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:03,388
- You know you can
talk to me, right?

202
00:12:03,506 --> 00:12:06,707
- I mean... It's a little weird.

203
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:09,543
Mom on a date.

204
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:13,815
But she should get to have
a little fun too, I guess.

205
00:12:15,894 --> 00:12:20,387
I always got you, right?

206
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:22,407
- You bet, kid.

207
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:30,139
Popcorn fight!

208
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:33,050
(laughs)

209
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:35,044
(mellow music)

210
00:12:35,205 --> 00:12:37,905
- You're sure
you don't want some?

211
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:40,032
- Oh, no,
I really don't do sugar,

212
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:42,385
But don't let me stop you.

213
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:48,415
(clicks tongue)
- so...

214
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:51,519
Greg seems like a nice boy.
- He sure is.

215
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,667
You can ask me if you want to.

216
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,593
(chuckles)

217
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:01,412
- You got me.

218
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:03,656
Is greg's mom
still in the picture?

219
00:13:03,775 --> 00:13:05,492
Because I would never...
- No.

220
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,619
We lost her.

221
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:14,258
Janis.

222
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:18,262
That was her name.
She was a great mom.

223
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:20,048
(sighs)
- I'm sure.

224
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:26,679
- Cindy.

225
00:13:26,798 --> 00:13:29,098
There is something
I need to tell you.

226
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:35,462
I really would like a bite
of that ice cream.

227
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:38,691
(laughs)

228
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:42,103
- It is really good.
- Yeah?

229
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,030
Oh, my gosh!
- Mm-hmm.

230
00:13:44,148 --> 00:13:45,973
I tried telling you.

231
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:47,742
- It is so good!

232
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:54,541
(car approaching)

233
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:02,131
Anytime.

234
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:06,569
I'll call you.

235
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:08,304
- Bye.

236
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:19,082
(knocks)

237
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:21,417
- Okay, it either went

238
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,344
Amazing or absolutely awful

239
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:24,754
If you're already
writing about it.

240
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:26,739
(gasps)

241
00:14:26,858 --> 00:14:28,424
- No, no peeking!

242
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:30,760
(laughter)
I'm not done with it yet.

243
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,912
- Okay, well, then,
give me the play by play.

244
00:14:33,031 --> 00:14:35,098
- Oh, he's...

245
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:38,692
He's... So charming,

246
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:40,753
And thoughtful,

247
00:14:40,872 --> 00:14:43,931
And, I mean,
he really listens,

248
00:14:43,933 --> 00:14:45,850
Which is no small feat
for a man.

249
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:47,668
(chuckles)

250
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:50,704
What can I say? He's...

251
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,932
(sighs)
...He's amazing.

252
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:58,438
- I'm waiting for the "but."

253
00:14:58,556 --> 00:15:01,715
- Well, he lost his wife.

254
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:03,459
- He's a widower?

255
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:06,129
- Two years now.
- Really?

256
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:10,191
I didn't get that from him.

257
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:13,870
- Well... We both know
how difficult that can be,
don't we?

258
00:15:15,882 --> 00:15:17,332
- Sure.

259
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,038
- You don't think I'm making
a terrible mistake, do you?

260
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:26,891
- No.

261
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:28,468
- You approve?
(laughs)

262
00:15:28,586 --> 00:15:31,154
- Not so fast, we'll see.

263
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:32,972
(soft music)

264
00:15:33,091 --> 00:15:35,558
(birds chirping)

265
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:42,065
(children laughing)

266
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:48,429
- Hi! Oh, you must be
the best friend, lori, right?

267
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,673
- That's me. And you are?
- Hi.

268
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,176
I'm megan.
This is my husband, john,

269
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:56,846
And that's our...
Well, john's daughter, dana.

270
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:59,407
- Oh, it's nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

271
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,184
- How long have you guys
known randy?

272
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:03,853
- Ah, it's going on five years
now for me.

273
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,764
- Yeah, randy and john
are thick as thieves.

274
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:08,174
Oh, dana, honey.

275
00:16:08,292 --> 00:16:11,027
Dana, come meet someone.

276
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:13,846
Dana?
- Dana!

277
00:16:13,965 --> 00:16:16,991
- Uh, teenagers, right?

278
00:16:16,993 --> 00:16:20,294
And the divorce adds to it too,
you know.

279
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:22,188
Well, I better deliver
the salad.

280
00:16:22,306 --> 00:16:24,131
It's so good to meet you.

281
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:26,951
- Don't dress them
until they've been cut.

282
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:29,045
That way,
the oil soaks in better.

283
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:32,031
Then, some olive oil.

284
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,625
And...

285
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:35,976
...A touch of salt.

286
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:38,054
- I can't wait.

287
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:39,706
Oh, and I started eating spinach

288
00:16:39,824 --> 00:16:42,058
With my eggs in the morning,
just like you showed me.

289
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:43,968
- And you feel full longer,
right?

290
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,728
- Yeah, all the way until lunch.

291
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,730
- It's good, sweetheart.

292
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:50,800
Hey, would you do me a favour
and go inside and get me
some more tin foil?

293
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,719
- Mm-hmm.

294
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:57,890
- Hmm.

295
00:16:58,009 --> 00:17:00,484
- I know,
she's like a second kid.

296
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,395
- I wasn't gonna say anything.

297
00:17:02,513 --> 00:17:04,155
- She had a rough patch.

298
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:06,916
It was a nasty divorce.

299
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,401
Trouble at school.

300
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:12,447
It might have had to do with her
struggling with her weight.

301
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:14,848
I was just showing her
some healthier habits.

302
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:18,327
- Mm-hmm.
Well, that's very sweet.

303
00:17:20,865 --> 00:17:24,341
(soft music)

304
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:26,044
(chuckles)

305
00:17:28,639 --> 00:17:31,607
- Her hair had one, not two.
Yeah.

306
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,350
(overlapping chatter)

307
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:36,137
(laughter)

308
00:17:40,918 --> 00:17:44,778
(indistinct whispering)

309
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,363
...On the wall.

310
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:47,865
(clinking glass)
- excuse me.

311
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:51,051
I just... Don't mean
to interrupt.

312
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:56,132
I just wanted to say
what a pleasure it is
to host you all.

313
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:59,693
Some of my best
and oldest friends,

314
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:01,954
And some great new ones too.

315
00:18:02,073 --> 00:18:04,231
And if that wasn't enough
to celebrate,

316
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:09,736
I just learned here
that this lovely young lady...

317
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:11,555
...Has lost three pounds.

318
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:14,150
- Way to go, sweetheart.
- Way to go, dana!
(chuckles)

319
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:16,861
- We are so very proud of you.

320
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:18,471
- Randy made a deal with her.

321
00:18:18,589 --> 00:18:22,416
He gives her $100
for every pound.

322
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:24,735
- Great job, sweetheart.
- Thanks.

323
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:26,662
(eerie music)

324
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:29,073
You see this? One, two, three.

325
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:31,025
(indistinct chatter)

326
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:47,458
(eerie music)

327
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:03,349
- Two tours.

328
00:19:03,467 --> 00:19:06,702
Active duty.

329
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:09,021
Oh, you shouldn't have
to do that.

330
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,706
Greg!

331
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,933
Greg, come in here, son!

332
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:15,319
Greg!

333
00:19:15,438 --> 00:19:17,062
You take care of these?

334
00:19:17,181 --> 00:19:20,366
- I can take those, ma'am.
- Thank you.

335
00:19:22,987 --> 00:19:24,553
He's so polite.

336
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:26,555
- That's what we learn
in the service.

337
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,584
Chivalry, honour, order.

338
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:33,796
It was pretty nasty over there.

339
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:42,388
- Do you mind if I ask you
how you lost your...

340
00:19:42,506 --> 00:19:43,797
- Janis.

341
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:47,243
- I'm so sorry.

342
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,728
- Yeah.

343
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:56,952
It was an accident.

344
00:19:56,954 --> 00:19:58,905
Janis loved climbing.

345
00:19:59,023 --> 00:20:00,756
We were on mount rainier.

346
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:03,868
She slipped, fell,
dead on impact.

347
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:10,099
- Uh... I'm... That's horrible.

348
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:11,834
- Yeah.

349
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:22,720
(ominous music)

350
00:20:31,681 --> 00:20:33,922
Hey, guys.
- Hey.

351
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,690
- You guys having a good time?

352
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:36,901
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

353
00:20:39,397 --> 00:20:42,615
- Well, what do you think?

354
00:20:44,568 --> 00:20:47,060
- Uh... Wow!

355
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:48,804
It's... It's beautiful.

356
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:50,790
- No, not about the ring,
about the man.

357
00:20:50,908 --> 00:20:52,716
What do you think about randy?

358
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:55,052
I mean, I know it's only been
a few months,

359
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:57,646
But I just... I feel like...

360
00:20:57,674 --> 00:20:59,740
Like, this just feels right.

361
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:02,075
I feel like he's the one.

362
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:05,746
- Well, you did say
you did just start dating, so...

363
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:07,214
Maybe it is a good idea

364
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,249
Just to date a few other men,
just to see.

365
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:12,886
- Are you kidding?
Randy's perfect.

366
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:15,982
Tyson is finally gonna have
a father again.

367
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,652
- Okay, cindy, I'm just gonna
be honest with you.

368
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:24,064
Listen, I know he seems nice,
and he's charming.

369
00:21:24,183 --> 00:21:27,401
To you, at least,
and to tyson too,

370
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:30,179
But other times, he's--
- lori.

371
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:32,681
(sighs)

372
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:34,925
I'm okay.

373
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:38,337
You don't have
to protect me anymore.

374
00:21:38,456 --> 00:21:40,856
I love you.

375
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,591
- I love you too.

376
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,603
(squealing excitedly)

377
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:48,955
(laughter)

378
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:51,851
- Alright, everyone, cheers!
To my amazing new family.

379
00:21:51,969 --> 00:21:54,778
(all): Cheers!

380
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:58,190
- Woo-hoo!

381
00:21:58,309 --> 00:21:59,466
- This cider is so good.

382
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:01,618
- Thanks, mr. Roth.
- No, it's "dad," now.

383
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,121
Or coach. Either one is fine.

384
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:06,532
(chuckles)

385
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:08,534
Greg, would you mind
grabbing another one for me?

386
00:22:08,652 --> 00:22:10,310
- Yes, sir.

387
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:12,413
- That's good. Yeah.
- That's pretty good.

388
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:21,547
- So, greg, how are you feeling?

389
00:22:21,665 --> 00:22:23,883
New family, new brother.

390
00:22:24,001 --> 00:22:25,309
- Good, ma'am.

391
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:28,995
Tyson's cool, and his mom
is, like, really nice.

392
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:31,557
- Well, having known cindy
for 20 years,

393
00:22:31,675 --> 00:22:33,242
I can say she's amazing.

394
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:35,227
- Yeah, they always are.

395
00:22:35,346 --> 00:22:38,731
(ominous music)

396
00:22:38,849 --> 00:22:40,441
- Go ahead, son.

397
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:46,146
I just wanna
let you know that...

398
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:48,832
You're welcome here
as long as you like.

399
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:51,260
- What?

400
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:53,821
- Me and greg, we're moving in.

401
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:57,766
But, like I said, you can
stay here as long as you want.

402
00:22:57,794 --> 00:22:59,502
No pressure.

403
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:05,424
Excuse me.

404
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:10,888
(crickets chirping)

405
00:23:17,054 --> 00:23:19,530
(randy groans)

406
00:23:19,532 --> 00:23:22,024
(cindy yells): No, no! Stop!

407
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:26,529
(randy groans)

408
00:23:26,689 --> 00:23:28,346
- Hey, buddy, are you okay?

409
00:23:28,366 --> 00:23:30,282
(groaning)

410
00:23:30,401 --> 00:23:33,727
- Cindy! Hey!
What's going on?

411
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:35,137
(cindy screaming)

412
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:36,831
Oh, my god! Randy!

413
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:45,330
Oh my god, randy,
get off of her!

414
00:23:45,449 --> 00:23:48,867
Get off of her! Stop it!
Get off!

415
00:23:48,986 --> 00:23:50,469
(strangled moan)

416
00:23:50,588 --> 00:23:52,546
Cindy! Are you okay?

417
00:23:52,706 --> 00:23:54,764
(panting)

418
00:23:54,884 --> 00:23:56,559
Come here.

419
00:23:56,719 --> 00:23:58,385
Are you okay?

420
00:23:58,504 --> 00:23:59,937
- Honey, I'm so sorry.

421
00:24:00,055 --> 00:24:01,963
- Stay away from her!
- No, lori.

422
00:24:01,965 --> 00:24:04,475
- Get away from her!
- Lori. Lori, it's okay.

423
00:24:04,593 --> 00:24:07,219
- No, are you kidding? No!
- Yes, just go. Please go.

424
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:08,929
- What?
- Get the hell out of here!

425
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:10,656
- Go, go, go! Lori, go!

426
00:24:10,774 --> 00:24:14,510
- No, are you kidding?
- Please go!

427
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:16,770
(heavy panting)

428
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:18,180
- What?

429
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:21,125
(groans in pain)

430
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:26,780
Hey.

431
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:29,133
(crying)

432
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:34,621
- You okay?

433
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:36,256
Shh, it's okay.

434
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:37,925
It's okay.

435
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:40,928
Shh, it's okay.
Oh, god.

436
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:43,964
It's okay.
(randy panting)

437
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:45,708
- Alright, boys,
10 jumping jacks.

438
00:24:45,735 --> 00:24:47,485
Ready?
(blows whistle)

439
00:24:47,603 --> 00:24:48,894
That's it!

440
00:24:49,012 --> 00:24:53,640
To be the best, you need
to train like the best!

441
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:56,460
- Cindy, about last night...

442
00:24:56,462 --> 00:24:58,295
- Uh...

443
00:24:58,297 --> 00:25:01,131
Randy has ptsd.

444
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:04,952
Admittedly, I didn't realize

445
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:08,547
How severe
those emotions can be.

446
00:25:08,666 --> 00:25:11,141
He saw a lot of bad stuff
over there.

447
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:12,976
- He was hurting you.

448
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:14,478
- Yeah.

449
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,146
He's working through it.

450
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:17,998
- But cindy, you can't just...

451
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:20,150
- He's my husband.

452
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:21,894
That's all there is to it.

453
00:25:22,012 --> 00:25:23,229
(whistle blows outside)

454
00:25:23,347 --> 00:25:26,490
(randy): One, two, three, four,

455
00:25:26,492 --> 00:25:29,568
Five, six!

456
00:25:29,687 --> 00:25:31,495
(whistle blows)
high knees!

457
00:25:31,497 --> 00:25:33,179
Come on! You got this!

458
00:25:33,241 --> 00:25:35,616
(dryer tumbling)

459
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:54,260
- Hey, honey, it's okay.
It's not a big deal.

460
00:25:54,378 --> 00:25:55,669
- I'm sorry.

461
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:57,404
- Hey.

462
00:25:57,564 --> 00:26:00,591
It's okay, it's okay.
You're okay.

463
00:26:00,709 --> 00:26:02,342
- Are you gonna tell my dad?

464
00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:03,978
- Greg, time for school!

465
00:26:10,385 --> 00:26:12,102
You hear me, bud?

466
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:16,189
We gotta go.
- Yes, sir.

467
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:20,160
(tense music)

468
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:28,385
- Here's some salad.
- Can I have some garlic bread?

469
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:31,313
- Yes.
- Yeah.

470
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,632
- Here we go!

471
00:26:33,751 --> 00:26:36,877
Veal parmesan with a pesto pasta

472
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:39,563
And<i> sauce tomate à la...</i>

473
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:41,898
- Wow, that looks exceptional.

474
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:45,218
- His veal parm is the best.

475
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:48,221
- Thank you, honey.

476
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,832
Well, enjoy it while it lasts,

477
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:53,611
Because for the next five days,
chef randy is going on vacation.

478
00:26:53,729 --> 00:26:56,580
- Buenos aires...
It sounds so fancy.

479
00:26:56,582 --> 00:26:58,732
- We will exclusively
be dining out.

480
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,584
- Don't worry, guys, I'm a star

481
00:27:00,586 --> 00:27:02,661
When it comes to anything
microwaveable.
(chuckles)

482
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,830
- Well, I wouldn't have minded
to watch greg and tyson

483
00:27:04,948 --> 00:27:06,590
While you guys
are on your honeymoon.

484
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:08,500
Although, I don't mind
the extra help, dana.

485
00:27:08,619 --> 00:27:10,336
- Oh, that's okay,
dana is just trying

486
00:27:10,454 --> 00:27:12,579
To earn some extra money
for senior week.

487
00:27:12,698 --> 00:27:14,414
Speaking of,

488
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:17,051
There's a scale in the bathroom,
young lass.

489
00:27:21,157 --> 00:27:24,290
- Oh, and actually,
tomorrow is grocery day,

490
00:27:24,352 --> 00:27:25,851
So if you have anything
you want special,

491
00:27:25,969 --> 00:27:27,778
Let me know, besides pancakes.
- Aww.

492
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:30,189
- That's very generous,
but I've already got it covered.

493
00:27:30,307 --> 00:27:32,282
I only buy organic.

494
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:33,950
- Randy's more
into eggs and bacon.

495
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:36,195
- Protein is a healthier way
to start the day,

496
00:27:36,313 --> 00:27:37,804
But I'm sure you knew that.

497
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:39,606
- Four pounds!

498
00:27:39,725 --> 00:27:41,742
- Dana, you're crushing it!
- Alright!

499
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:48,223
There you go. Well done.

500
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:51,877
- Well, I think you look
beautiful either way, honey.

501
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,715
- She sure does.

502
00:27:56,834 --> 00:27:58,592
(tense music)

503
00:28:05,734 --> 00:28:09,836
- Our winter is their summer,
so it's spring-ish right now.

504
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:11,897
- Do you have enough pink?

505
00:28:12,015 --> 00:28:13,415
(chuckles)

506
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:17,144
- Don't mess with my pink,
missy.

507
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:19,905
- Hey, can I ask you a question?

508
00:28:20,023 --> 00:28:24,501
What is the deal
between randy and dana?

509
00:28:24,503 --> 00:28:26,169
- What do you mean?

510
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:29,456
- He's just awfully friendly
with her, don't you think?

511
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:35,270
- Randy's helping her through
a difficult part of her life.

512
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:36,964
What's wrong with that?

513
00:28:43,264 --> 00:28:44,704
- You need a hat.

514
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:47,282
- I love this!
(chuckles)

515
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:49,209
Woo!

516
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,603
What do you think?
Buenos aires?

517
00:28:51,722 --> 00:28:53,597
(chuckles)
- yes.

518
00:28:53,715 --> 00:28:57,383
- I guess I'll have to wear it
on the plane.

519
00:28:57,445 --> 00:28:59,945
- How about everything else?

520
00:29:00,063 --> 00:29:02,464
Now that you are
a newly married woman.

521
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:04,191
- It's great.

522
00:29:04,193 --> 00:29:05,850
Well, you know, you live here.

523
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:09,362
- Well, I was referring
to other marital things.

524
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:13,625
(laughs)
- oh, right.

525
00:29:13,744 --> 00:29:17,053
Well, as you know,
randy is very fit.

526
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:18,404
- Yes, I noticed.

527
00:29:18,466 --> 00:29:19,890
- And vigorous.

528
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:21,208
- Oh!

529
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:22,468
- But...

530
00:29:22,586 --> 00:29:24,911
(chuckles awkwardly)

531
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:29,900
...That vigour hasn't exactly
translated to the marital bed.

532
00:29:29,902 --> 00:29:31,477
- Well, hey,

533
00:29:31,595 --> 00:29:33,553
I'm sure
a sexy little number,

534
00:29:33,672 --> 00:29:35,572
A picturesque honeymoon...

535
00:29:35,574 --> 00:29:37,423
That will change very quickly.

536
00:29:37,485 --> 00:29:40,426
Okay, this is not gonna help
with the vigour,

537
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:43,005
So this does not go.
(laughter)

538
00:29:43,032 --> 00:29:45,248
- Those were my favourite!
- No.

539
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,584
- And you'll take care of tyson
while I'm gone?

540
00:29:47,586 --> 00:29:49,419
You know he hasn't been
without me since tom.

541
00:29:49,421 --> 00:29:50,846
- You know I will.

542
00:29:50,873 --> 00:29:53,406
- Ooh! And don't forget
he has his game on Saturday.

543
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:54,741
- Of course.

544
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,409
- And the grocery list
is on the fridge.

545
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:57,911
- You got it.
- And vitamins at night.

546
00:29:58,029 --> 00:29:59,171
- I know, I know.

547
00:29:59,289 --> 00:30:00,764
- His vitamins are next
to his bed.

548
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:02,432
- Would you get out of here?

549
00:30:02,434 --> 00:30:03,884
(ominous music)

550
00:30:05,938 --> 00:30:09,289
(vomiting)

551
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,517
(panting)

552
00:30:11,635 --> 00:30:13,393
(vomiting)

553
00:30:15,523 --> 00:30:19,024
(toilet flushes)

554
00:30:19,142 --> 00:30:21,242
- Sorry.
- Excuse me.

555
00:30:21,244 --> 00:30:24,546
- Are you okay?

556
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:26,406
- Yeah, I'm fine.

557
00:30:28,652 --> 00:30:32,112
- Dana, has randy ever hurt you?

558
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:37,467
Well, I'm just curious
if randy has ever exhibited...

559
00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:39,636
Symptoms of ptsd?

560
00:30:39,638 --> 00:30:41,713
Anything that's dangerous
or worrisome?

561
00:30:41,832 --> 00:30:44,424
- If he did, I would think
his family would support him
about it.

562
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:49,796
Why are you living here again?

563
00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:52,432
Aren't you, like,
in your forties?

564
00:31:00,517 --> 00:31:03,193
(tense music)

565
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:10,534
(sighs)

566
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:18,341
- Wow.

567
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:20,252
(chuckles)

568
00:31:23,949 --> 00:31:25,382
Wow.

569
00:31:27,711 --> 00:31:29,502
My new wife.

570
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:31,263
- Aww.

571
00:31:36,028 --> 00:31:37,936
(chuckles)

572
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:45,319
(chuckles)

573
00:31:47,323 --> 00:31:49,156
- My new husband.

574
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,665
(chuckles)

575
00:32:03,822 --> 00:32:04,963
- Cindy.

576
00:32:05,082 --> 00:32:07,341
Tonight, I want you...

577
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:12,896
...To bare your all to me.

578
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:14,139
Will you?

579
00:32:21,431 --> 00:32:24,224
- Hmm... I bare my all.

580
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:25,667
- You are mine...

581
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:27,060
(zipper zipping)

582
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:29,112
...To hold and to feel.

583
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:37,204
Go on.

584
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:43,109
- Hmm...

585
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,628
- Say it.

586
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:49,800
Say it.

587
00:32:51,962 --> 00:32:56,198
(gasps)
say it.

588
00:32:56,225 --> 00:32:58,425
- I...

589
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:00,035
...I'm yours...

590
00:33:00,062 --> 00:33:02,479
- Say it.
- ...To hold and feel.

591
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:06,783
(moans)

592
00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:08,768
When you touch me, I'm real.

593
00:33:08,887 --> 00:33:12,138
- Again.

594
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:15,291
- I am yours to hold
and to feel.
- Yeah.

595
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:17,703
- When you touch me, I am real.

596
00:33:17,821 --> 00:33:20,363
- Yes. Say it again.

597
00:33:20,482 --> 00:33:22,482
- I bare my all.
- Louder.

598
00:33:22,543 --> 00:33:24,467
- I am yours to hold
and to feel.

599
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:25,711
(moans)

600
00:33:25,829 --> 00:33:28,988
When you touch me, I am real.
- Yes.

601
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:31,958
- I bare my all.

602
00:33:32,077 --> 00:33:33,719
- Ah, yes.
- I am yours...

603
00:33:33,837 --> 00:33:35,795
- Yes.
- ...To hold and to feel.

604
00:33:35,914 --> 00:33:38,907
- Yes.
- When you touch me, I am real.

605
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:41,184
(tense music)

606
00:33:44,347 --> 00:33:46,440
- Ah, shoot.

607
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:07,269
(clatter)

608
00:34:07,296 --> 00:34:08,754
(groans in pain)

609
00:34:14,711 --> 00:34:17,128
(intriguing music)

610
00:34:17,247 --> 00:34:19,806
Oh, my god.

611
00:34:26,348 --> 00:34:29,349
So... Okay,
how was buenos aires?

612
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:32,110
- Mmm... Wonderful.

613
00:34:32,229 --> 00:34:37,991
It's elegant and rich
with history and culture.

614
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,859
Yeah, it was really fun.

615
00:34:39,978 --> 00:34:43,029
- And how about
the other marital stuff?

616
00:34:43,148 --> 00:34:46,124
Is it accelerating
the way that you hoped?

617
00:34:46,243 --> 00:34:48,001
- Yeah, it's great.

618
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:52,572
- Good.

619
00:34:52,733 --> 00:34:54,515
- How was everything here?

620
00:34:54,517 --> 00:34:58,269
- Oh, well, everything
with tyson was fine,

621
00:34:58,271 --> 00:35:02,531
But there was something weird
that happened.

622
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:04,250
- What?

623
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:05,936
- Well...

624
00:35:14,454 --> 00:35:16,780
I kinda found this.

625
00:35:16,898 --> 00:35:18,764
(ominous music)

626
00:35:18,826 --> 00:35:21,568
- Oh.

627
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:23,236
Oh, my god.

628
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:27,541
- I found it in one of randy's
camping boxes in the basement.

629
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:32,278
- So, you were snooping
through his stuff?

630
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:34,247
- What? No, of course not.

631
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:36,683
- It's kind of a weird thing
to just come across.

632
00:35:36,685 --> 00:35:38,510
- Well, it's kind of
a weird thing

633
00:35:38,628 --> 00:35:41,588
To keep in a plastic bag
in a box in the basement.

634
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:43,623
I...
- You don't have to do that.

635
00:35:43,684 --> 00:35:47,352
- Do what?
- That. This.

636
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:50,705
You never have anything nice
to say about randy,

637
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:53,600
And any opportunity you get
to say something bad,

638
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:55,360
You jump all over it!

639
00:35:55,478 --> 00:35:56,862
- What would you rather me do?

640
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,271
Would you rather me lie about--

641
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:01,199
- I want you to be happy for me!

642
00:36:01,318 --> 00:36:02,659
Please.

643
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,707
- Listen, I just don't think
that randy is the one.

644
00:36:08,825 --> 00:36:10,816
We haven't known him that long.

645
00:36:10,878 --> 00:36:13,636
Every single thing I learn
about this guy, I mean...

646
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:16,322
Greg is being raised
like a soldier.

647
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:18,717
He's so afraid of his father
he's wetting the bed.

648
00:36:18,835 --> 00:36:22,387
And dana has an eating disorder
randy's basically making worse.

649
00:36:22,505 --> 00:36:25,715
And what kind of a new husband
doesn't want to sleep
with his new wife?

650
00:36:25,833 --> 00:36:29,652
- Hey, that is my husband
you're talking about, okay?!

651
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:31,396
And what do you know
about marriage?

652
00:36:31,514 --> 00:36:33,156
Or men? Look at you.

653
00:36:33,158 --> 00:36:37,477
You're living in my house
with my kids and my husband!

654
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:40,363
(tense music)

655
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:47,704
I think it's time you found
your own place.

656
00:36:50,867 --> 00:36:52,626
I'm sorry.

657
00:37:11,888 --> 00:37:14,622
(sighs)

658
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:17,317
(haunting music)

659
00:37:19,562 --> 00:37:22,656
(distant sirens wailing)

660
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:50,517
(phone ringing)

661
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:54,813
- Hello. Lori.

662
00:37:54,931 --> 00:37:57,240
Oh... Lori baker speaking,
I mean.

663
00:37:57,242 --> 00:37:59,559
<i> - Lori, it's me.</i>
<i> Can you come over right away?</i>

664
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:01,152
- Hey, are you okay?

665
00:38:01,271 --> 00:38:02,821
<i> (voice continues)</i>
- hold on.

666
00:38:02,939 --> 00:38:04,698
What? I'm gonna be right there.

667
00:38:07,101 --> 00:38:09,035
(ominous music)

668
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:33,351
- Thanks for coming so quickly.

669
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:35,687
- Yeah, of course,
I'm happy to help.

670
00:38:35,805 --> 00:38:37,930
Are you okay?
Is tyson okay?

671
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:40,933
- Yeah, he's good.
I'm good. I'm...

672
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:43,878
I'm sorry, I don't mean
to worry you.

673
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:47,123
So...

674
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:49,475
- Yeah, what's going on?
- I don't know.

675
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:51,669
You were always so good
with cars.

676
00:38:51,671 --> 00:38:55,114
I just... Can't get it to start.

677
00:38:55,233 --> 00:38:57,709
- Oh, well, did randy
take a look at it?

678
00:38:57,827 --> 00:38:59,302
- Oh, no.

679
00:38:59,304 --> 00:39:02,714
I didn't want to bother him
at work.

680
00:39:02,832 --> 00:39:04,549
- Okay.

681
00:39:04,667 --> 00:39:06,426
Let me check it out.

682
00:39:09,038 --> 00:39:12,815
Alright, let's see.

683
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:15,051
- Ah, thanks again.

684
00:39:15,169 --> 00:39:18,037
I just... Needed to go
to the store,

685
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:20,857
Just, you know,
get out of the house,

686
00:39:20,975 --> 00:39:24,176
But then, this happened.

687
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:26,145
- Huh.

688
00:39:26,264 --> 00:39:29,449
Uh, you know what?
Try it now.

689
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:36,873
(engine starts)

690
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:44,430
- You're a life saver.

691
00:39:44,432 --> 00:39:47,032
- It was just a fuse that needed
to be pushed back in.

692
00:39:47,094 --> 00:39:49,761
- Oh.

693
00:39:49,879 --> 00:39:53,022
- Maybe it came loose when you
went over a bump or something.

694
00:39:53,024 --> 00:39:56,041
- Yeah.

695
00:39:56,103 --> 00:39:59,211
- Well, hey, I'd really love
to see you and tyson more

696
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:04,275
If you maybe wanna grab dinner
on Sunday or this week.

697
00:40:04,394 --> 00:40:05,985
Anytime, really.

698
00:40:08,373 --> 00:40:10,055
Is everything okay?

699
00:40:10,117 --> 00:40:13,209
- It's good, I'm good.
We're... I'm fine.
(chuckles)

700
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:15,803
- Okay.

701
00:40:15,831 --> 00:40:18,865
Well, dinner this week?

702
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:23,235
- Yeah, I'll check my calendar.

703
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,838
- Okay.

704
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:30,743
Alright, well...
I'll see you soon.

705
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:34,213
- See you soon.

706
00:40:34,332 --> 00:40:36,916
(car starts)

707
00:40:36,977 --> 00:40:40,486
(ominous music)

708
00:40:40,488 --> 00:40:42,889
(randy): What are you doing?!
(cindy sniffles)

709
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:46,651
Yeah, just what you need,
more crap from the store!

710
00:40:46,769 --> 00:40:50,746
This isn't even organic.

711
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:53,675
I specifically told you
to stay home!

712
00:40:53,702 --> 00:40:55,343
Look at this.

713
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:58,830
Here's an idea:
More ugly pink garbage.

714
00:40:58,948 --> 00:41:00,940
Oh, and a small!

715
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:03,259
That's ambitious!

716
00:41:03,261 --> 00:41:05,061
What did I say, huh?

717
00:41:05,063 --> 00:41:06,913
What did I say?
- Just...

718
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:09,265
- No more bleaching your hair!

719
00:41:09,267 --> 00:41:11,342
This crap is filled
with chemicals!

720
00:41:11,461 --> 00:41:13,094
I am your husband!

721
00:41:13,254 --> 00:41:15,438
Doesn't that mean
anything to you?

722
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,348
Don't you care about yourself?

723
00:41:17,467 --> 00:41:19,684
When I tell you to do something,
you do it!

724
00:41:22,405 --> 00:41:25,039
(ominous music)

725
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:27,783
(water running)

726
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:29,903
(washer and dryer tumbling)

727
00:41:37,204 --> 00:41:40,513
Cindy!

728
00:41:40,515 --> 00:41:43,282
Cindy, get in here!

729
00:41:43,401 --> 00:41:45,251
(sniffles)

730
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:52,157
- Hey.

731
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:54,218
- Where were you?

732
00:41:54,337 --> 00:41:56,679
- Just... Laundry.

733
00:41:59,676 --> 00:42:01,300
- You know, I was talking
to the boys

734
00:42:01,419 --> 00:42:03,269
About taking a camping trip
this weekend.

735
00:42:05,515 --> 00:42:09,901
- I was hoping I could see lori
for dinner this Sunday.

736
00:42:10,019 --> 00:42:11,903
- I don't think so.

737
00:42:12,021 --> 00:42:14,906

738
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:29,921

- We don't cry.

758
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:41,233
We don't ever cry.

759
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:44,587
It's over now.

760
00:43:44,589 --> 00:43:48,850
In the marines, we were taught
to show no fear.

761
00:43:48,877 --> 00:43:52,712
We developed a healthy
short-term memory.

762
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:59,026
I'm going to teach you.

763
00:43:59,054 --> 00:44:01,620
Okay?

764
00:44:01,681 --> 00:44:03,389
You'll be fine.

765
00:44:07,729 --> 00:44:09,929
Good.

766
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:11,230
Now, eat up.

767
00:44:33,496 --> 00:44:35,320

768
00:44:35,382 --> 00:44:37,973
(door creaking)

769
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:40,385
- I heard on the radio.
It's uh...

770
00:44:40,503 --> 00:44:44,055
I couldn't believe it.
(sobbing)

771
00:44:44,173 --> 00:44:46,240
Is it true?

772
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:48,893
- It was her idea to go out
to the lake.

773
00:44:49,011 --> 00:44:51,062
- What happened?

774
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:53,039
- Boys were playing
on the beach,

775
00:44:53,041 --> 00:44:56,901
And she asked if we could
take the raft out.

776
00:44:57,019 --> 00:44:59,145
Thought it'd be romantic,
just the two of us.

777
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,571
Speed boat went by...

778
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:03,165
And we went over.
I was climbing back on...

779
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:06,335
She said something
about a cramp...

780
00:45:06,337 --> 00:45:09,354
I looked over...
She was gone.

781
00:45:09,416 --> 00:45:12,191
- Is tyson okay? Can I see?

782
00:45:12,252 --> 00:45:14,752
- We watched a movie.
He's asleep.

783
00:45:14,871 --> 00:45:16,587
I don't want to wake him.

784
00:45:16,706 --> 00:45:18,831
Is there anything else?

785
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:21,759
- I don't believe it.

786
00:45:21,878 --> 00:45:24,503
- Goodnight, lori.

787
00:45:24,622 --> 00:45:26,005
(door creaking)

788
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:28,266
(inhales deeply)

789
00:45:28,384 --> 00:45:30,768
- I don't believe you!

790
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:37,316
(eerie music)

791
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:46,659
(sinister music)

792
00:45:59,749 --> 00:46:02,300
(sobbing softly)

793
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:11,217
<i> (cindy): He's...</i>
<i> He's so charming.</i>

794
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:15,646
<i> Like, this just feels right.</i>
<i> I feel like he's the one.</i>

795
00:46:15,765 --> 00:46:17,973
<i> (lori): He's keeping</i>
<i> his dead wife's ashes</i>

796
00:46:18,092 --> 00:46:20,425
<i> In a plastic bag</i>
<i> in the basement!</i>

797
00:46:20,487 --> 00:46:22,244
<i> - Randy roth's residence.</i>

798
00:46:22,246 --> 00:46:24,188
<i> You know what to do.</i>
<i> (screams)</i>

799
00:46:24,306 --> 00:46:27,325

800
00:46:27,443 --> 00:46:29,035
<i> (cindy): You're a good</i>
<i> friend, lori...</i>

801
00:46:31,572 --> 00:46:34,999
<i> (lori): I'm gonna be here</i>
<i> for you and tyson.</i>

802
00:46:35,117 --> 00:46:38,869
<i> Listen, I promise you...</i>
<i> I always will be.</i>

803
00:46:38,988 --> 00:46:41,413
<i> (tyson): I always got you,</i>
<i> right?</i>

804
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:43,132
<i> (lori): You bet, kid.</i>

805
00:46:49,632 --> 00:46:52,558
(gasps, pants rapidly)

806
00:47:06,074 --> 00:47:09,033
(tense music)

807
00:47:13,656 --> 00:47:17,116
(engine stops)

808
00:47:17,234 --> 00:47:19,210
(clattering)

809
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:41,566
- Hey!
- Don't hurt me!

810
00:47:41,684 --> 00:47:43,642
- Who are you?
What are you doing here?

811
00:47:43,761 --> 00:47:46,328
- I just... I needed
to talk to you.

812
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:48,497
I would have come sooner, but...

813
00:47:48,499 --> 00:47:52,334
I hadn't worked up
the courage yet.

814
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:54,704
Can I bring my cat inside?

815
00:47:57,292 --> 00:47:59,250
- Yeah, sure.

816
00:48:02,947 --> 00:48:05,923
- My name is donna clift.

817
00:48:06,042 --> 00:48:07,425
- I'm lori.

818
00:48:07,543 --> 00:48:11,003
- You're the friend
of that woman who drowned.

819
00:48:11,121 --> 00:48:13,355
- Did you know cindy?

820
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:14,473
- No.

821
00:48:18,796 --> 00:48:21,030
His name is minx.

822
00:48:21,032 --> 00:48:23,382
I got him after me and randy
divorced.

823
00:48:23,443 --> 00:48:27,294
I needed him after everything
that happened...

824
00:48:27,322 --> 00:48:30,389
Randy tried to drown me.
I should have said something!

825
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:31,890
Or done something.

826
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:33,525
I'm so sorry your friend--

827
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:37,713
- Wait, wait... Hold on.
Wait, please.

828
00:48:37,715 --> 00:48:41,367
Can you please just start
from the beginning?

829
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:43,218
(exhales softly)

830
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:46,872
- I was a divorcee.

831
00:48:46,991 --> 00:48:49,224
I met randy at a grocery store.

832
00:48:49,226 --> 00:48:53,320
It was actually that little boy
of his who asked me out.

833
00:48:53,348 --> 00:48:55,640
It was so cute.

834
00:48:55,758 --> 00:48:57,900
We were married
a few months later.

835
00:48:57,902 --> 00:49:02,404
I wanted to get swept up,
like some fairy tale princess.

836
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:03,555
(chuckles)

837
00:49:03,674 --> 00:49:05,983
Pretty stupid, right?

838
00:49:06,102 --> 00:49:09,820
- Not at all.
- The moment we got married...

839
00:49:09,939 --> 00:49:12,581
The charm was gone.

840
00:49:12,583 --> 00:49:15,918
The want of me... Was gone.

841
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:19,238
Then we went on this white-water
rafting trip.

842
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:21,573
We were on our own raft.
My parents were ahead of us.

843
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:24,109
They rounded this bend
in the river...

844
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:26,445
Then he got this look
in his eyes,

845
00:49:26,506 --> 00:49:28,080
Like he was analyzing me.

846
00:49:28,198 --> 00:49:29,581
I could never forget it.

847
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,860
And then he... Slammed our raft
into these rocks.

848
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:34,753
The raft flooded,
we were sinking

849
00:49:34,872 --> 00:49:37,940
And I didn't have a vest on
and I can barely swim.

850
00:49:37,942 --> 00:49:40,426
My dad got there just in time.

851
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:42,928
He pulled me out of the water.

852
00:49:43,047 --> 00:49:47,950
Randy apologized,
said it was an accident.

853
00:49:47,952 --> 00:49:51,954
But I swear he wanted
to kill me.

854
00:49:51,956 --> 00:49:54,215
- Why didn't you call
the police?

855
00:49:54,242 --> 00:49:56,050
- And say what?

856
00:49:56,077 --> 00:49:57,885
That my husband purposely
tried to drown me

857
00:49:57,912 --> 00:49:59,611
For no reason whatsoever?

858
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:02,223
My own parents
didn't even believe me!

859
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:04,375
(scoffs)

860
00:50:04,493 --> 00:50:07,378
- Okay, well, why now?
Why call me?

861
00:50:07,496 --> 00:50:11,090
- I needed to tell somebody.
Because...

862
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:15,219
Because I know
he'll do it again.

863
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:20,182
(tense music)

864
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:27,606
(tense music)

865
00:50:33,798 --> 00:50:35,981
(sighs)

866
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:37,908
- Boys, get in here!

867
00:50:45,868 --> 00:50:48,693
So you two don't want
to respect the rules.

868
00:50:48,755 --> 00:50:52,664
- I was gonna clean it after...
(clattering)

869
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:55,350
- What were you gonna say?
Come here.

870
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:57,002
On the line!

871
00:50:57,121 --> 00:51:00,931
You stay right there.
What do you say?

872
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:02,933
"yes, sir!"

873
00:51:03,052 --> 00:51:05,194
- Yes, sir.

874
00:51:05,196 --> 00:51:07,438
- Yes, sir.

875
00:51:07,556 --> 00:51:11,183
- You know, it's a good thing
I'm here.

876
00:51:11,301 --> 00:51:14,653
Because I need to teach you...
(clattering)

877
00:51:24,073 --> 00:51:27,883
Down on your knees.

878
00:51:27,885 --> 00:51:30,160
Down on your knees! Now!

879
00:51:30,279 --> 00:51:31,620
Clean this up.

880
00:51:31,738 --> 00:51:33,689
I want this floor so clean

881
00:51:33,691 --> 00:51:35,299
That you can eat off of it!

882
00:51:35,417 --> 00:51:36,725
You hear me?

883
00:51:36,727 --> 00:51:38,677
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

884
00:51:44,477 --> 00:51:45,784
- Argh!
- You hear me?

885
00:51:45,786 --> 00:51:47,736
(greg grunting)

886
00:51:47,738 --> 00:51:50,255
I want this floor spotless.

887
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:52,407
Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

888
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:54,168
- Yes, sir.
(boys groan)

889
00:51:54,195 --> 00:51:55,694
- You should know better.

890
00:51:58,515 --> 00:52:01,033
(indistinct chatter)

891
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:08,240
- Miss baker? Miss baker,
thanks for your patience.

892
00:52:08,358 --> 00:52:11,335
How can I help you?

893
00:52:11,453 --> 00:52:13,646
- And she swears randy
tried to kill her.

894
00:52:13,648 --> 00:52:15,673
- And donna clift,
she'd be willing

895
00:52:15,791 --> 00:52:17,508
To speak with us
about this?

896
00:52:17,626 --> 00:52:19,918
- She's scared,
but she wants to help.

897
00:52:20,037 --> 00:52:22,680
- Okay. But you should know
the medical examiner

898
00:52:22,798 --> 00:52:24,698
Listed cindy's death
as an accidental drowning.

899
00:52:24,725 --> 00:52:26,008
- You don't know randy.

900
00:52:26,126 --> 00:52:27,943
I saw him the night
of cindy's death.

901
00:52:27,945 --> 00:52:29,703
He was totally unemotional.

902
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:31,463
- People grieve in a lot
of different ways.

903
00:52:31,524 --> 00:52:34,299
- This wasn't shock, and tyson
is still living with him.

904
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,285
I have to get him
out of there.

905
00:52:36,287 --> 00:52:38,520
- You'd prefer
he'd live with you?

906
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:41,866
- As opposed to a murderer?

907
00:52:41,984 --> 00:52:44,809
He's not safe there!
- Miss baker...

908
00:52:44,871 --> 00:52:47,462
King county looks into
every accidental death

909
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:49,548
To see if there are
suspicious circumstances.

910
00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:51,542
In this case,
there are none.

911
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,802
- What about his first wife,
janis?

912
00:52:53,804 --> 00:52:56,988
Between her and donna,
and now cindy, come on!

913
00:52:57,049 --> 00:52:58,807
That is a pattern, right?

914
00:52:58,809 --> 00:53:00,676
- We'll look into it, ma'am.

915
00:53:10,321 --> 00:53:13,672
- I'm really sorry.
I wish we could do more.

916
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:16,975
- I told cindy, I promised her

917
00:53:17,094 --> 00:53:21,179
That I would take care
of her and tyson.

918
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,948
And I failed her.

919
00:53:25,161 --> 00:53:29,246
But I'm not going
to fail her son.

920
00:53:29,365 --> 00:53:32,917
- Look, custody usually goes
to the other parent,

921
00:53:33,035 --> 00:53:36,011
But since cindy and randy
only just got married,

922
00:53:36,013 --> 00:53:38,847
I'd check and see
if there's a preexisting will.

923
00:53:38,849 --> 00:53:41,866
Maybe cindy listed a grandparent
or someone else

924
00:53:41,928 --> 00:53:44,762
To take in her kid.
That's what I would do.

925
00:53:47,524 --> 00:53:49,858
- Thank you, detective peters.

926
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:54,696
- Soupie. It's sue peters.
Soupie.

927
00:53:54,698 --> 00:53:58,033
- Soupie.

928
00:53:58,035 --> 00:53:59,777
Soupie, please...

929
00:53:59,895 --> 00:54:02,279
Look into janis's death.

930
00:54:02,398 --> 00:54:03,739
Can you do that?

931
00:54:11,215 --> 00:54:13,082
(ominous music)

932
00:54:39,676 --> 00:54:41,860
(rustling)

933
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:05,950
- See anything you like?

934
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:09,346
Take whatever you want.
It's just garbage.

935
00:55:09,465 --> 00:55:11,623
- I went by the bank today.

936
00:55:11,684 --> 00:55:14,959
Checked the safety deposit box
that cindy and I shared.

937
00:55:15,021 --> 00:55:17,688
It was empty.

938
00:55:17,806 --> 00:55:20,858
- Lori!
- Hey!

939
00:55:20,976 --> 00:55:23,193
How are you doing?

940
00:55:23,312 --> 00:55:25,863
- Good.

941
00:55:25,981 --> 00:55:28,440
- Tell you what, why don't you,
uh... Come inside?

942
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:31,410
We're excited to, uh...
See an old friend.

943
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:52,389
Would you like a cookie?

944
00:56:00,424 --> 00:56:02,024
- There you go, ma'am.

945
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:07,237
- That's it, boys. You can go
do your homework with dana.

946
00:56:12,436 --> 00:56:13,702
Now...

947
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:19,583
What's all this about a safety
deposit box?

948
00:56:19,701 --> 00:56:21,326
- I checked the registry.

949
00:56:21,445 --> 00:56:23,604
You were the last one
to sign it out.

950
00:56:23,631 --> 00:56:26,865
- Cindy's my wife.
Or... She was.

951
00:56:26,926 --> 00:56:30,427
So anything that belongs
to her...

952
00:56:30,546 --> 00:56:31,595
...Now belongs to me.

953
00:56:31,713 --> 00:56:33,263
- There was a will in there

954
00:56:33,382 --> 00:56:35,190
And I know cindy
would have made sure

955
00:56:35,192 --> 00:56:36,508
That tyson was taken care of.

956
00:56:36,626 --> 00:56:38,102
- And he is.

957
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:40,604
- I want tyson back.

958
00:56:40,722 --> 00:56:42,956
- Well, that's interesting
because...

959
00:56:42,983 --> 00:56:45,851
I never thought he was yours
to begin with.

960
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:48,870
- I've known him
since the day he was born.

961
00:56:48,872 --> 00:56:50,522
I'm practically his mother!

962
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,207
- But you're not, lori.

963
00:56:52,209 --> 00:56:55,661
You're not his mother.
You're not his family.

964
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,867
- When you look at me...

965
00:57:01,985 --> 00:57:05,570
You just see
a lonely woman, huh?

966
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:07,071
But I'm not alone.

967
00:57:07,133 --> 00:57:09,983
And cindy wasn't the only one
you've done this to.

968
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:11,343
- Is that right?

969
00:57:18,902 --> 00:57:21,270
So who you've been talking to,
lori?

970
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:27,242
Who has lori been talking to?

971
00:57:27,244 --> 00:57:30,729
- I'm not afraid of you.

972
00:57:30,847 --> 00:57:32,281
- Get out of my house.

973
00:57:44,094 --> 00:57:46,336
- Lori!

974
00:57:46,455 --> 00:57:49,465
Please don't go.
- Oh, sweetheart.

975
00:57:49,583 --> 00:57:53,435
I'm so sorry. Listen...
Listen to me. Listen, okay?

976
00:57:53,437 --> 00:57:55,846
I am gonna come back
for you, okay?

977
00:57:55,964 --> 00:57:58,273
- Please don't leave.
- I promise you...

978
00:57:58,275 --> 00:58:00,942
That I'm gonna come back, okay?

979
00:58:00,944 --> 00:58:04,538
- Please don't leave...
- Listen, listen to me, okay?

980
00:58:04,565 --> 00:58:08,025
I promise, okay?
I'm gonna come back for you.

981
00:58:08,143 --> 00:58:11,737
- Please don't leave.
- Tyson!

982
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:17,125
- It's okay...

983
00:58:17,127 --> 00:58:20,871
- Don't make me say it again,
tyson.

984
00:58:20,989 --> 00:58:22,372
- You're doing okay.

985
00:58:28,589 --> 00:58:31,973
- Let's go, boys.

986
00:58:31,975 --> 00:58:35,010
Oh, and I might just go
have a word with your friend.

987
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:49,491
- Just where do you think
you're going, young lady?

988
00:58:49,493 --> 00:58:51,752
- I'm just going to randy's, I
don't get what the big deal is.

989
00:58:51,779 --> 00:58:53,495
- The big deal is your mother
said you're grounded.

990
00:58:53,497 --> 00:58:55,830
- She's not my mother.
Randy lost his wife;

991
00:58:55,832 --> 00:58:57,741
Greg and tyson
lost their mom.

992
00:58:57,859 --> 00:59:01,352
They need me.
- You get back here right now.

993
00:59:01,413 --> 00:59:03,187
(crying)

994
00:59:03,207 --> 00:59:04,414
Get back here right now!

995
00:59:04,533 --> 00:59:06,049
- I don't know
what your problem is.

996
00:59:06,051 --> 00:59:08,252
He's your friend!
- John!

997
00:59:08,370 --> 00:59:11,396
- Stop!
- Let go! You're hurting me!

998
00:59:11,398 --> 00:59:15,199
- John, stop! Stop, please!
We can't! We can't!

999
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:20,038
Please! Please.
(panting)

1000
00:59:20,099 --> 00:59:22,140
Oh, my god!

1001
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:27,938
(eerie music)

1002
00:59:43,739 --> 00:59:47,182
- Hey... Thanks for meeting me
halfway.

1003
00:59:47,184 --> 00:59:49,793
- As soon as you said
the name randy roth...

1004
00:59:49,911 --> 00:59:51,461
I got my keys.

1005
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:53,630
- So you remember the case
pretty well?

1006
00:59:55,751 --> 00:59:57,509
- I'll never forget that one.

1007
01:00:00,397 --> 01:00:01,713
- Minx!

1008
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:03,247
Psst, psst!

1009
01:00:03,309 --> 01:00:05,400
Minx?

1010
01:00:05,402 --> 01:00:07,144
Minxie cat!

1011
01:00:09,097 --> 01:00:11,406
Samantha, have you seen minx?

1012
01:00:11,408 --> 01:00:14,501
- No, mom!

1013
01:00:14,528 --> 01:00:16,361
- Darned scaredy cat...

1014
01:00:22,444 --> 01:00:24,828
- Everything here
points to an accident.

1015
01:00:24,946 --> 01:00:27,422
- I never had a shred
of hard evidence.

1016
01:00:27,424 --> 01:00:29,774
But his story kept on changing.

1017
01:00:29,835 --> 01:00:33,503
Where she was, where he was,
how it happened.

1018
01:00:33,622 --> 01:00:35,313
A couple of us went up
and walked the trail.

1019
01:00:35,315 --> 01:00:37,932
Tried to recreate
how it happened.

1020
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:41,419
When you called and said
another wife had died...

1021
01:00:41,538 --> 01:00:44,848
In an accident?
(scoffs)

1022
01:00:44,966 --> 01:00:47,392
Let's just say
I wasn't surprised.

1023
01:00:58,580 --> 01:01:00,489
(loud meowing)

1024
01:01:11,877 --> 01:01:14,711
(tense music)

1025
01:01:20,977 --> 01:01:23,095
(gasping)

1026
01:01:38,845 --> 01:01:40,779
(gasping)

1027
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:48,078
- There has to be something--
something you can do.

1028
01:01:48,196 --> 01:01:50,321
- Janis' death is suspicious,

1029
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:53,383
But like cindy, the official
reports point to an accident.

1030
01:01:53,385 --> 01:01:55,693
Donna clift
won't return my calls.

1031
01:01:55,754 --> 01:01:58,179
And since randy was legally
cindy's husband,

1032
01:01:58,181 --> 01:02:00,257
He had every right to remove
the personal items

1033
01:02:00,375 --> 01:02:02,183
From the security deposit box.

1034
01:02:02,185 --> 01:02:05,387
- But he's lying!
- Lori, it's not that simple.

1035
01:02:05,505 --> 01:02:08,724
- Are you a real cop
or is that badge just for show?

1036
01:02:13,822 --> 01:02:16,197
Look, I just...

1037
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:18,108
I need to get tyson
out of there.

1038
01:02:18,226 --> 01:02:20,777
- If he finds out that we're
investigating him for murder,

1039
01:02:20,896 --> 01:02:24,448
He might destroy what little
evidence is still out there.

1040
01:02:24,566 --> 01:02:26,875
- So... You do believe
that he did it?

1041
01:02:26,877 --> 01:02:33,765
- Yes, but if I bring this case
to a da now, they will kill it.

1042
01:02:33,767 --> 01:02:36,534
Okay, look...
It's not over.

1043
01:02:36,653 --> 01:02:39,296
We are checking county records
to see if cindy filed

1044
01:02:39,414 --> 01:02:42,132
A copy of the will
with the registrar's office.

1045
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:44,484
- And if she didn't?
- Well, then the only way

1046
01:02:44,511 --> 01:02:47,637
To get tyson away from randy
will be to arrest him,

1047
01:02:47,756 --> 01:02:53,143
Which we cannot do
without more than just
circumstantial evidence.

1048
01:02:53,261 --> 01:02:55,270
(sighs)

1049
01:03:05,916 --> 01:03:07,674
- John?

1050
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:09,659
John, honey?
- Ah...

1051
01:03:16,927 --> 01:03:20,854
I'll go make some... Lemonade?

1052
01:03:20,881 --> 01:03:23,765
(john sniffles)

1053
01:03:23,767 --> 01:03:27,302
- I, uh... Sorry about
your loss.

1054
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:33,441
- Thanks. Uh... But I'm not here
about cindy.

1055
01:03:33,443 --> 01:03:35,018
I'm here about dana.

1056
01:03:40,884 --> 01:03:42,651
- What about her?

1057
01:03:42,769 --> 01:03:47,239
- I think that you're not
comfortable with dana and randy.

1058
01:03:50,318 --> 01:03:53,444
- Nah. What about it?
I've known randy for years.

1059
01:03:53,563 --> 01:03:56,631
- And so that makes it okay
for him to spend

1060
01:03:56,633 --> 01:03:59,251
That much time
with your teenage daughter?

1061
01:04:02,831 --> 01:04:05,048
- And just what
are you insinuating?

1062
01:04:05,166 --> 01:04:07,050
- Dana worships randy.

1063
01:04:07,168 --> 01:04:09,127
She's given herself
an eating disorder

1064
01:04:09,245 --> 01:04:11,462
Just to gain his approval.
(scoffs)

1065
01:04:11,581 --> 01:04:13,073
- I don't even know
what you're talking--

1066
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:15,725
- There's something going on
here, and I think you see that.

1067
01:04:15,844 --> 01:04:17,986
I mean, aren't you worried?

1068
01:04:17,988 --> 01:04:20,305
Can't you see randy
is grooming her to be some--

1069
01:04:20,423 --> 01:04:21,898
- I'm her father!

1070
01:04:22,017 --> 01:04:23,975
If anything inappropriate
was going on between randy

1071
01:04:24,093 --> 01:04:25,676
And my daughter, don't you think
I'd know about it?

1072
01:04:25,737 --> 01:04:28,029
And don't you think
I'd put a stop to it?

1073
01:04:32,452 --> 01:04:34,286
I think it's time
for you to leave.

1074
01:04:38,008 --> 01:04:39,249
- Uh...

1075
01:04:45,782 --> 01:04:47,591
- You're leaving already?

1076
01:04:49,903 --> 01:04:51,928
(crying): Please
don't blame him!

1077
01:04:54,808 --> 01:04:57,692
John's just...
He's just choosing

1078
01:04:57,694 --> 01:05:00,862
To believe what he wants
to believe.

1079
01:05:00,864 --> 01:05:03,899
- That his friend would never
betray him.

1080
01:05:04,017 --> 01:05:05,650
(sobbing)

1081
01:05:14,878 --> 01:05:19,472
Dana couldn't stand me
when I first moved in.

1082
01:05:19,499 --> 01:05:22,884
And randy was the only one
who could keep the peace.

1083
01:05:22,886 --> 01:05:27,889
So if there's anyone
to blame, it's me.

1084
01:05:27,891 --> 01:05:31,893
- There is someone to blame,
and it is not you, or dana.

1085
01:05:31,895 --> 01:05:34,545
- She thinks she loves him.

1086
01:05:34,664 --> 01:05:39,976
So, if... If we demand
that she stops seeing him,

1087
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:43,313
It will send her running
straight into his arms.

1088
01:05:43,431 --> 01:05:45,406
I don't know what to do.

1089
01:05:45,408 --> 01:05:46,983
- Then help me.

1090
01:05:47,102 --> 01:05:50,320
Help me prove
that randy's dangerous.

1091
01:05:50,438 --> 01:05:55,233
Help me get tyson and dana
and greg away from him for good.

1092
01:05:55,351 --> 01:05:57,844
- I... I... I don't know
anything.

1093
01:05:57,871 --> 01:05:59,420
- Yes, you do.

1094
01:05:59,422 --> 01:06:01,772
You've known him for years.

1095
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:05,927
All those women...
All those lies...

1096
01:06:05,929 --> 01:06:07,712
Just tell me what you know.

1097
01:06:10,767 --> 01:06:14,268
<i> (megan): There was a...</i>
<i> There was a fiancée.</i>

1098
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:16,754
<i> She was... She was just like</i>
<i> the others.</i>

1099
01:06:16,873 --> 01:06:21,017
<i> Pretty, blonde.</i>
<i> Widowed, with kids.</i>

1100
01:06:21,136 --> 01:06:23,912
<i> Single mom, lonely.</i>
<i> Just like cindy.</i>

1101
01:06:23,914 --> 01:06:26,948
<i> They were always like that.</i>

1102
01:06:26,950 --> 01:06:29,192
<i> They thought they were getting</i>
<i> this charming husband</i>

1103
01:06:29,310 --> 01:06:33,046
<i> And amazing father, but...</i>
<i> That's not what they got.</i>

1104
01:06:33,073 --> 01:06:36,441
<i> (scoffs)</i>
<i> not at all.</i>

1105
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:40,795
<i> It was southern,</i>
<i> like mary jane or...</i>

1106
01:06:40,797 --> 01:06:43,581
<i> Mary jo. Yeah.</i>
<i> Mary jo philips.</i>

1107
01:06:53,059 --> 01:06:55,719
(birds chirping)

1108
01:07:03,895 --> 01:07:06,021
(woman mumbling)

1109
01:07:12,979 --> 01:07:15,563
- Come on, gang! Let's go!
We're late for school!

1110
01:07:15,565 --> 01:07:17,866
- Mary jo philips?
- Yep.

1111
01:07:17,984 --> 01:07:20,668
Come on gang, let's go.
Let's go!

1112
01:07:20,670 --> 01:07:23,721
- I'm lori baker. I was hoping
to speak with you about--

1113
01:07:23,749 --> 01:07:25,840
- Sorry, I don't have time
for whatever you're selling.

1114
01:07:25,842 --> 01:07:28,359
- I'm here about randy roth.

1115
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:30,103
You two were engaged, right?

1116
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:33,214
Was it his son who first asked
you out on a date with his dad?

1117
01:07:40,164 --> 01:07:45,251
- He was... Charming.
Thoughtful.

1118
01:07:45,312 --> 01:07:48,495
He pursued me aggressively and
as a single mom with two kids,

1119
01:07:48,497 --> 01:07:50,364
That felt really good.
(chuckles)

1120
01:07:50,366 --> 01:07:52,792
Honestly, the relationship
was amazing until...

1121
01:07:52,819 --> 01:07:55,269
- Until what?

1122
01:07:55,388 --> 01:07:57,980
- He asked me
about life insurance...

1123
01:07:58,099 --> 01:08:01,559
His first wife had died
in an accident and...

1124
01:08:01,620 --> 01:08:03,453
He wanted to make sure
the kids were taken care of

1125
01:08:03,571 --> 01:08:04,996
No matter what, but...

1126
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,809
...I'd had ovarian cancer.

1127
01:08:09,836 --> 01:08:12,629
I'm uninsurable.

1128
01:08:12,747 --> 01:08:15,873
It was after that
that he grew distant.

1129
01:08:15,992 --> 01:08:19,410
I... Thought maybe the fear
of marrying another woman

1130
01:08:19,471 --> 01:08:22,046
He might lose
that drove him away.

1131
01:08:22,165 --> 01:08:25,992
We broke it off
within the month.

1132
01:08:26,019 --> 01:08:30,054
- It wasn't the threat of cancer
that drove randy away.

1133
01:08:30,173 --> 01:08:34,408
And randy's first wife
did not die in an accident.

1134
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:36,169
Neither did my friend.

1135
01:08:36,196 --> 01:08:39,730
- So randy was...

1136
01:08:39,849 --> 01:08:43,118
If I had been insurable,
he was going to...

1137
01:08:49,592 --> 01:08:52,502
Okay. What can I do?

1138
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:56,097
- Camping is gonna be
so much fun.

1139
01:08:56,099 --> 01:08:58,916
- Right? I love making s'mores.

1140
01:08:59,035 --> 01:09:02,937
I mean, a nutritious
vegetable sampler...

1141
01:09:02,939 --> 01:09:04,922
- Where are we going
camping again?

1142
01:09:05,041 --> 01:09:07,867
- Olympia national forest.
- Is it true...

1143
01:09:07,894 --> 01:09:10,444
That there are ghost bears
in that forest?

1144
01:09:10,446 --> 01:09:12,872
- Maybe!
- Are you afraid of ghost bears?

1145
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:14,599
- No...
- Don't worry.

1146
01:09:14,759 --> 01:09:16,617
Dad will beat them up
if they come into our tent.

1147
01:09:16,619 --> 01:09:18,528
Isn't that right, dad?
- You bet, sport!

1148
01:09:25,945 --> 01:09:27,770
Dana, would you mind finishing
loading up the truck?

1149
01:09:27,789 --> 01:09:30,631
We'll be right back.

1150
01:09:30,633 --> 01:09:31,916
Thanks.

1151
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:36,637
- Hey, ma'am, uh... You're...
You're really pretty.

1152
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:38,639
You wanna go on a date
with my dad?

1153
01:09:38,641 --> 01:09:39,883
- Greg.

1154
01:09:40,001 --> 01:09:42,543
Sorry, my son's very forward.

1155
01:09:42,662 --> 01:09:45,129
Here, let me help you
with that. Greg?
- Oh, thank you.

1156
01:09:45,248 --> 01:09:48,983
- I'm randy. Randy roth.
- Stacey. Nice to meet you.

1157
01:09:48,985 --> 01:09:51,744
- Nice to meet you, too.
- My car's over here.

1158
01:09:51,771 --> 01:09:54,171
(chuckles shyly)
thanks so much.

1159
01:09:54,232 --> 01:09:56,224
- You're welcome.
(stacey): What's your name?

1160
01:09:56,342 --> 01:09:57,975
- Greg. Nice to meet you.
- You too.

1161
01:09:58,094 --> 01:10:00,161
I have a son too.
His name's liam.

1162
01:10:00,163 --> 01:10:02,572
- Liam?

1163
01:10:02,690 --> 01:10:04,616
(tense music)

1164
01:10:17,071 --> 01:10:18,896
- Soupie, I was about
to call you.

1165
01:10:18,898 --> 01:10:21,365
- You were right.
It's the insurance.

1166
01:10:21,426 --> 01:10:23,534
Randy updated
the policy on cindy

1167
01:10:23,595 --> 01:10:25,686
Before the ink on the marriage
certificate was even dry.

1168
01:10:25,688 --> 01:10:28,281
Same thing with janis.
(lori sighs)

1169
01:10:28,308 --> 01:10:32,843
- So this is--
- this is good. It's motive.

1170
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:34,878
But it's not why I'm here.

1171
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:36,773
- What is this?

1172
01:10:36,891 --> 01:10:38,124
- It's cindy's will.

1173
01:10:38,151 --> 01:10:40,017
She registered it
with the county.

1174
01:10:40,136 --> 01:10:43,404
- What does it say?
- I think you should read it.

1175
01:11:00,056 --> 01:11:01,864
<i> (cindy's voice): In the event</i>
<i> of my death,</i>

1176
01:11:01,883 --> 01:11:05,209
<i> I, cynthia baumgartner,</i>
<i>leave all my worldly possessions</i>

1177
01:11:05,328 --> 01:11:07,470
<i> To my son tyson baumgartner.</i>

1178
01:11:07,588 --> 01:11:10,265
<i> If he is not of legal</i>
<i> guardianship age,</i>

1179
01:11:10,383 --> 01:11:12,883
<i> I ask that he be put</i>
<i> in the custody</i>

1180
01:11:13,002 --> 01:11:15,386
<i> Of my good friend, lori baker.</i>

1181
01:11:15,504 --> 01:11:18,572
<i> Lori hasn't just been</i>
<i> like family to us...</i>

1182
01:11:18,574 --> 01:11:20,741
<i> Lori is our family.</i>

1183
01:11:20,743 --> 01:11:25,004
<i>As such, I designate lori to be</i>
<i>the sole executor of my estate,</i>

1184
01:11:25,031 --> 01:11:27,565
<i> Managing all of my assets,</i>
<i> possessions</i>

1185
01:11:27,683 --> 01:11:29,492
<i>And any insurance compensations,</i>

1186
01:11:29,610 --> 01:11:34,038
<i> Which are to be put in a trust</i>
<i> until my son is of age.</i>

1187
01:11:41,289 --> 01:11:44,515
- Get the hell off my property!
- I'm here for tyson.

1188
01:11:44,517 --> 01:11:46,751
- He's my boy now.
- My lawyer called yours.

1189
01:11:46,869 --> 01:11:49,012
This is not a negotiation.
He's coming with me--

1190
01:11:49,130 --> 01:11:52,440
- He needs discipline!
He's staying here with me.
- Let's go, honey.

1191
01:11:52,442 --> 01:11:54,700
Tyson's coming with me
and he's never coming back here.

1192
01:11:54,728 --> 01:11:57,020
Come on, honey, let's go.
- Tyson, get in the house!

1193
01:11:57,138 --> 01:11:59,096
- It's okay.
- He's not going anywhere.

1194
01:11:59,215 --> 01:12:02,132
- Move aside, randy!

1195
01:12:02,193 --> 01:12:04,152
- You're gonna make me?

1196
01:12:07,482 --> 01:12:11,200
- How about we call the police
and we get them here instead?

1197
01:12:13,629 --> 01:12:15,079
- Tyson, come here.

1198
01:12:25,550 --> 01:12:27,249
- Do you wanna go with her?

1199
01:12:27,368 --> 01:12:29,427
Or do you wanna stay here
with your family?

1200
01:12:33,767 --> 01:12:35,483
- I wanna go.

1201
01:12:35,485 --> 01:12:37,134
(soft piano music)

1202
01:12:37,253 --> 01:12:39,395
- Come here, sweetheart.

1203
01:12:45,403 --> 01:12:47,694
Let's get in the car, okay?

1204
01:12:47,696 --> 01:12:49,864
- Get out of here
before I change my mind!

1205
01:12:52,527 --> 01:12:54,619
(lori's breath trembling)

1206
01:13:13,356 --> 01:13:16,307
(suspenseful music)

1207
01:13:28,037 --> 01:13:31,205
(clears throat)

1208
01:13:31,207 --> 01:13:35,134
- Yes, detective?
- Ma'am, I was wondering

1209
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:37,803
If you had a chance to look over
the files I sent you?

1210
01:13:37,831 --> 01:13:39,664
On randy roth?

1211
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:43,835
- Have a seat, detective.

1212
01:13:54,564 --> 01:13:58,232
So what do the detectives
in your division call my office?

1213
01:13:58,234 --> 01:14:04,755
- Special operations unit
of the deputy prosecutor
for king county.

1214
01:14:04,816 --> 01:14:07,817
The office of last resort,
ma'am.

1215
01:14:07,935 --> 01:14:09,910
- And how many other prosecutors

1216
01:14:09,912 --> 01:14:13,096
Did you take this case to first?
- Quite a few.

1217
01:14:13,158 --> 01:14:15,341
- And do you know why
they didn't take your case?

1218
01:14:15,368 --> 01:14:18,085
- Well, the evidence is...
- Nonexistent.

1219
01:14:18,087 --> 01:14:20,938
Circumstantial at best.
- Yes, ma'am.

1220
01:14:20,999 --> 01:14:23,073
- Yes.

1221
01:14:23,192 --> 01:14:26,169
But that's not why
they turned down your case.

1222
01:14:26,287 --> 01:14:31,415
They turned it down
because they have no balls.

1223
01:14:31,534 --> 01:14:33,342
I read your file...

1224
01:14:33,461 --> 01:14:36,345
Randy roth is
a cold-blooded killer,

1225
01:14:36,464 --> 01:14:39,590
He stalks his prey
and baits them with a smile,

1226
01:14:39,708 --> 01:14:41,926
Flowers, and a marriage
proposal.

1227
01:14:42,044 --> 01:14:44,370
And once he has them chained
to eternity,

1228
01:14:44,397 --> 01:14:46,263
He insures them
and kills them.

1229
01:14:46,382 --> 01:14:48,432
He steals from them
and their children.

1230
01:14:48,551 --> 01:14:51,694
- So? How do you want to proceed
with the evidence?

1231
01:14:51,812 --> 01:14:53,362
- Forget the evidence.

1232
01:14:53,481 --> 01:14:55,907
He's too smart.
We'll never get him that way.

1233
01:14:58,561 --> 01:14:59,944
No.

1234
01:15:00,062 --> 01:15:06,225
No, we get this guy
by making him think he can win.

1235
01:15:06,252 --> 01:15:09,286
I will get you a warrant
to search his house.

1236
01:15:09,405 --> 01:15:12,806
You just find me enough
that we can hang him
with his own lies.

1237
01:15:12,808 --> 01:15:14,324
We catch him in enough lies...

1238
01:15:14,385 --> 01:15:16,794
And he'll convince the jury
that he's a predator.

1239
01:15:16,912 --> 01:15:19,463
(chuckles)
hell...

1240
01:15:19,582 --> 01:15:22,816
We might even get a conviction.

1241
01:15:22,818 --> 01:15:24,485
- No. No. It's my turn now.

1242
01:15:24,487 --> 01:15:26,771
You are done talking, alright?
You listen to me.

1243
01:15:26,889 --> 01:15:29,490
I've got two kids,
a mortgage and a funeral.

1244
01:15:29,492 --> 01:15:31,809
I need that money now!
You hear me!

1245
01:15:31,927 --> 01:15:34,979
I don't care what some crap
piece of paper says.

1246
01:15:35,097 --> 01:15:38,482
I was her husband.
Her... Her soulmate!

1247
01:15:38,601 --> 01:15:41,452
I need that money now!
It's mine!

1248
01:15:44,481 --> 01:15:46,958
(sirens wailing)

1249
01:15:56,352 --> 01:15:57,635
- Randy?

1250
01:16:04,435 --> 01:16:07,011
What's happening?

1251
01:16:07,129 --> 01:16:08,612
- Take greg
to your parents' house.

1252
01:16:08,614 --> 01:16:11,715
Don't say a word.
Not to anyone.

1253
01:16:11,776 --> 01:16:13,067
Go!

1254
01:16:27,883 --> 01:16:31,002
You're wasting your time.
- We'll see about that.

1255
01:16:37,727 --> 01:16:42,046
- Okay, guys... Let's tear
this place apart!

1256
01:16:42,164 --> 01:16:45,516
(suspenseful music)

1257
01:17:21,796 --> 01:17:24,588
- We've got nothing.

1258
01:17:24,707 --> 01:17:27,007
Nothing!

1259
01:17:27,009 --> 01:17:28,559
(sighs)

1260
01:17:32,573 --> 01:17:34,506
(soupie scoffs)

1261
01:17:34,567 --> 01:17:37,634
- Okay, guys.

1262
01:17:37,654 --> 01:17:39,920
Let's wrap it up and head home.

1263
01:17:39,922 --> 01:17:41,322
Thank you.

1264
01:17:46,788 --> 01:17:50,765
Hey... Uh-uh!

1265
01:17:50,883 --> 01:17:53,801
We tried.

1266
01:17:53,919 --> 01:17:55,252
- Yeah.

1267
01:18:12,154 --> 01:18:14,730
(exhales)

1268
01:18:14,849 --> 01:18:16,440
(sighs)

1269
01:18:20,996 --> 01:18:24,998
(chair clattering)

1270
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,076
(crickets chirping)

1271
01:18:38,756 --> 01:18:41,298
(tense music)

1272
01:19:00,636 --> 01:19:04,288
(indistinct whispering)

1273
01:19:04,290 --> 01:19:06,449
(clears throat)

1274
01:19:09,236 --> 01:19:12,395
- Please.

1275
01:19:12,557 --> 01:19:14,564
(exhales)
- mr. Roth.

1276
01:19:14,625 --> 01:19:18,035
I do apologize for the way
that you've been treated.

1277
01:19:18,153 --> 01:19:19,694
There were inconsistencies

1278
01:19:19,714 --> 01:19:22,298
In what has officially been
reported as an accidental death

1279
01:19:22,416 --> 01:19:25,134
That led my colleagues
in the police department

1280
01:19:25,252 --> 01:19:26,743
To start looking for something

1281
01:19:26,804 --> 01:19:28,896
That most likely
doesn't even exist.

1282
01:19:28,898 --> 01:19:31,064
Certain people
may have overstepped.

1283
01:19:31,066 --> 01:19:32,324
- You think?

1284
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:34,718
- I know. But if you could
just be so kind

1285
01:19:34,837 --> 01:19:36,553
To answer a few questions,

1286
01:19:36,672 --> 01:19:39,774
I believe that we can just clear
this matter up today.

1287
01:19:42,344 --> 01:19:43,911
- Certainly.

1288
01:19:43,913 --> 01:19:47,247
Whatever you ladies need.
- Thank you.

1289
01:19:47,249 --> 01:19:49,617
(crying)

1290
01:19:52,112 --> 01:19:54,771
(knocking on door)
- dana?

1291
01:19:54,832 --> 01:19:58,517
- Someone's here to see you.

1292
01:19:58,544 --> 01:20:01,428
- Hey, dana.
Hey, greg.

1293
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:03,714
- Greg, honey, why don't you
come with me?

1294
01:20:05,843 --> 01:20:08,969
(tense music)

1295
01:20:12,942 --> 01:20:15,184
- So, your previous
relationship,

1296
01:20:15,302 --> 01:20:16,852
With mary jo philips.

1297
01:20:16,971 --> 01:20:19,780
Did that end organically?

1298
01:20:19,782 --> 01:20:22,541
- It just wasn't a good match.

1299
01:20:22,568 --> 01:20:25,635
She was really the one
who ended things.
- Okay.

1300
01:20:25,696 --> 01:20:28,047
But you were married
prior to that, correct?

1301
01:20:28,074 --> 01:20:31,275
To donna clift?
Why did that end?

1302
01:20:31,393 --> 01:20:34,870
- Donna's kid and my son greg
just didn't get along.

1303
01:20:34,989 --> 01:20:37,373
Donna's a lovely woman,
but you know,

1304
01:20:37,491 --> 01:20:40,042
It just didn't make sense
to stay together.

1305
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:42,378
Especially when there's
disharmony in the home.

1306
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:45,214
- Oh yeah, I can imagine.

1307
01:20:45,332 --> 01:20:48,551
- I'm sorry to ask.
My brothers both served...

1308
01:20:48,669 --> 01:20:53,889
But we heard you were struggling
with some post-traumatic stress?

1309
01:20:54,008 --> 01:20:55,683
- Sometimes.

1310
01:20:58,512 --> 01:21:02,064
But that's the cross we bear
to protect this great country.

1311
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:09,479
I just hope you ladies never
have to see those types
of things.

1312
01:21:09,598 --> 01:21:12,182
- Well, thank you
for your service.

1313
01:21:12,243 --> 01:21:14,318
- Yes, absolutely.

1314
01:21:14,436 --> 01:21:16,503
- He was in the marines.

1315
01:21:16,505 --> 01:21:20,249
He was a file clerk
in north carolina.

1316
01:21:20,367 --> 01:21:22,659
He was never in combat.

1317
01:21:22,778 --> 01:21:24,795
He never even left the country.

1318
01:21:28,092 --> 01:21:30,593
(dana sniffles)

1319
01:21:30,711 --> 01:21:32,553
- Do you know what this is?

1320
01:21:34,473 --> 01:21:37,841
- A promise ring?

1321
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:40,769
(sniffles)
- randy promised me...

1322
01:21:40,888 --> 01:21:43,213
He promised me
that he would marry me

1323
01:21:43,274 --> 01:21:45,349
As soon as I was old enough.

1324
01:21:45,467 --> 01:21:47,459
He told me he loved me!

1325
01:21:47,486 --> 01:21:49,612
- No...
- No, he promised me!

1326
01:21:49,730 --> 01:21:51,872
- Listen, dana.
- He promised me...

1327
01:21:51,874 --> 01:21:53,373
- You did nothing wrong.

1328
01:21:53,375 --> 01:21:54,825
Do you hear me? Nothing!

1329
01:21:58,714 --> 01:22:00,831
Oh, honey, it's going
to be okay.

1330
01:22:03,911 --> 01:22:07,813
- So, your relationship with
cynthia, it was good then?

1331
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:10,482
- Our marriage?
It was perfect.

1332
01:22:10,509 --> 01:22:13,226
- You and cindy were
in the honeymoon phase still?

1333
01:22:13,228 --> 01:22:15,729
- Oh, for sure.
I was very happy.

1334
01:22:15,731 --> 01:22:17,306
And cindy, she was...

1335
01:22:17,424 --> 01:22:21,751
Oh, she was ecstatic.
Over the moon.

1336
01:22:21,812 --> 01:22:24,355
Yeah, we were deeply in love
right up until...

1337
01:22:28,677 --> 01:22:30,152
(voice breaking): I'm sorry...

1338
01:22:35,609 --> 01:22:38,035
(soft music)

1339
01:22:41,356 --> 01:22:44,041
- Mom, dad...
- Come here, baby.

1340
01:22:46,528 --> 01:22:48,045
- I'm so sorry.

1341
01:22:55,437 --> 01:22:57,120
- Thank you.

1342
01:22:57,239 --> 01:23:00,057
- You'll take care of greg?
- Of course.

1343
01:23:04,230 --> 01:23:05,854
(crying)

1344
01:23:05,973 --> 01:23:08,348
- Mr. Roth, I would like
to read you a passage

1345
01:23:08,467 --> 01:23:10,192
From cynthia's diary.

1346
01:23:16,242 --> 01:23:19,034
She made two entries
the day before she died.

1347
01:23:19,153 --> 01:23:22,037
And the first one, mr. Roth...

1348
01:23:24,133 --> 01:23:25,749
...The first one is to you.

1349
01:23:28,996 --> 01:23:34,491
"randy does not love cindy.
Randy hates cindy.

1350
01:23:34,552 --> 01:23:38,904
Randy hates cindy's makeup,
her blonde hair.

1351
01:23:38,931 --> 01:23:42,499
He hates her cold fingers,
her ugly toes.

1352
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:45,135
Randy hates the things
she wears,

1353
01:23:45,253 --> 01:23:48,063
And everywhere she goes.

1354
01:23:48,182 --> 01:23:51,158
He hates her favourite
colour, pink.

1355
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:53,843
He hates to even
watch her drink.

1356
01:23:53,904 --> 01:23:56,830
He hates the way
she wakes from bed.

1357
01:23:56,832 --> 01:24:00,284
His every look
fills her with dread."

1358
01:24:04,381 --> 01:24:09,493
Now... That doesn't sound like
a woman who's "over the moon."

1359
01:24:09,611 --> 01:24:11,128
Does it?

1360
01:24:13,448 --> 01:24:14,923
- Mr. Roth.

1361
01:24:15,042 --> 01:24:17,667
Can you explain the nature
of your relationship

1362
01:24:17,786 --> 01:24:20,387
With your friend's daughter,
dana carlson?

1363
01:24:25,102 --> 01:24:26,977
(sighs)

1364
01:24:39,283 --> 01:24:41,800
- What are they doing here?

1365
01:24:41,827 --> 01:24:43,786
(exhales sharply)

1366
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:46,163
- They're here to make
their statements.

1367
01:24:51,203 --> 01:24:54,888
(soupie): Let's get you back
to your cell.

1368
01:24:54,890 --> 01:24:56,507
Better get comfortable in there.

1369
01:25:06,185 --> 01:25:09,144
(ethereal music)

1370
01:25:13,341 --> 01:25:15,692
(indistinct chatter)

1371
01:25:20,515 --> 01:25:23,659
<i>(cindy's voice): In this dream,</i>
<i> I never wake.</i>

1372
01:25:23,777 --> 01:25:26,345
<i> Tragedy now becomes my fate.</i>

1373
01:25:26,372 --> 01:25:30,999
<i> For I am with you always.</i>
<i>A mother's love never subsides.</i>

1374
01:25:31,118 --> 01:25:35,445
<i> I dream to hug you, kiss you,</i>
<i> touch you.</i>

1375
01:25:35,506 --> 01:25:38,248
<i> To hear your heartbeat</i>
<i> just once more.</i>

1376
01:25:38,366 --> 01:25:41,618
<i> Until we meet again, my child,</i>

1377
01:25:41,679 --> 01:25:44,805
<i> I love you forevermore.</i>

1378
01:25:52,281 --> 01:25:53,897
- Is everything okay?

1379
01:25:56,218 --> 01:26:00,154
- I'd like to read you something
from your mom. Is that okay?

1380
01:26:15,070 --> 01:26:17,954
"to my beloved son, tyson.

1381
01:26:18,073 --> 01:26:22,301
I have this dream,
I lie in sombre..."

1382
01:26:22,461 --> 01:26:25,512
(music swelling)
