00:58:39,867 --> 00:58:43,068

[Gertrude] YOU KNOW WHO I
WISH WAS WITH US? FRED.

650
00:58:52,914 --> 00:58:54,914
WHY FRED? HE SEEMS NICE.

651
00:58:54,982 --> 00:58:57,716
IT WAS NICE OF YOUR MOTHER
TO INVITE THEM TO THE RECEPTION.

652
00:58:57,785 --> 00:59:01,153
YOU KNOW, NEIGHBORLY. WE
OUGHTA GET TO KNOW THEM BETTER.

653
00:59:01,221 --> 00:59:04,723
I DON'T KNOW. I THINK HE'S
THE ONE WHO TURNED OVER...

654
00:59:04,792 --> 00:59:08,093
WHAT? WHAT WERE YOU GONNA SAY?

655
00:59:08,162 --> 00:59:10,443

00:59:36,924 --> 00:59:40,092
HELLO. THERE'S A YOUNGER COUPLE.

663
00:59:50,972 --> 00:59:54,573
ALWAYS SOMEONE INTERESTING TO
TALK TO HERE. NICE, LIVELY CROWD.

664
00:59:54,642 --> 00:59:57,359
I WANNA TAKE A SWIM
BEFORE LUNCH. <i>YES, SIR?</i>

665
00:59:57,428 --> 00:59:59,712
HI. UH, LAWRENCE
NEWMAN. YES, SIR.

666
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:02,414
I CALLED LAST WEEK. I TALKED
TO A YOUNG MAN, A MR. SULLIVAN...

667
01:00:02,483 --> 01:00:04,416
ABOUT A FRONT ROOM.

668
01:00:04,485 --> 01:00:07,430
HE TOLD US YOU'D BE ABLE
TO HELP US. A RESERVATION?

669
01:00:07,454 --> 01:00:09,822
NO. HE SAID THERE'D
BE NO PROBLEM.

670
01:00:09,891 --> 01:00:14,159
YOU CAN'T GET
ANYTHING HERE. FULL UP.

671
01:00:14,228 --> 01:00:16,395
OH.

672
01:00:16,463 --> 01:00:20,298
<i>UM, IS MR. SULLIVAN AROUND?
I'M SURE HE'D REMEMBER ME.</i>

673
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:22,601
UH, HE'S SWIMMING, BUT
HE COULDN'T HELP YOU.

674
01:00:22,670 --> 01:00:25,103
HE'S MY SON. I OWN THE PLACE.

675
01:00:25,172 --> 01:00:29,107
OH. I JUST THOUGHT HE'D REMEMBER
ME. I WAS HERE FOR TWO WEEKS.

676
01:00:29,176 --> 01:00:31,977
MISTER, WE'RE FULL UP.

677
01:00:32,046 --> 01:00:34,224
I COULDN'T HELP
YOU IF I WANTED TO.

678
01:00:34,248 --> 01:00:36,549
WE'LL GO ON TO THE
OTHER ONE THEN, LAWRENCE.

679
01:00:36,617 --> 01:00:38,751
WE WANTED TO SAVE ON
GAS. THAT'S WHY WE TRIED YOU.

680
01:00:38,819 --> 01:00:41,353
I'D BE GLAD TO HELP YOU
IF WE WEREN'T SO FULL UP.

681
01:00:41,422 --> 01:00:44,857
OH, YEAH, WE KNOW. WE SAW THE MOB
OUT THERE. WHAT, WITH 12 CARS OUTSIDE.

682
01:00:44,926 --> 01:00:47,492
HOW'D EVERYBODY ELSE
GET HERE? BY YACHT?

683
01:00:48,863 --> 01:00:51,697
I SAID WHAT I HAD TO SAY, LADY.

684
01:00:52,833 --> 01:00:55,768
JUMP IN WITH YOUR SON
AND DROWN, WILL YA?

685
01:00:55,836 --> 01:00:59,772
<i>LET'S GET OUTTA HERE BEFORE WE GET
SQUEEZED TO DEATH BY THE MOB IN HERE.</i>

<i>[Gertrude] YOU WOULD THINK HE
COULD'VE THOUGHT UP A GOOD EXCUSE.</i>

688
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:17,355
CROWDED. I WANTED TO CHOKE
HIM. DON'T TAKE IT TO HEART.

689
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:21,694
YOU CAN'T LEAVE THE HOUSE ANYMORE
WITHOUT SOMETHING HAPPENING.

690
01:01:21,762 --> 01:01:24,296
JUST GO TO ANOTHER PLACE, LULLY.

691
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:28,634
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
WE'RE GOING HOME.

692
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:31,136
NO! I WANNA GO TO ANOTHER PLACE!

693
01:01:31,205 --> 01:01:34,406
I WANNA GO TO ANOTHER
PLACE! STOP THAT!

694
01:01:34,475 --> 01:01:37,876
WHAT... LET ME OUT! LULLY!

695
01:01:37,945 --> 01:01:39,923
JUST LET ME OUT!
STOP THE CAR! STOP IT!

696
01:01:39,947 --> 01:01:42,693
I'M NOT GOING HOME! STOP
IT! WILL YOU CALM DOWN?

697
01:01:42,717 --> 01:01:45,428
I WANNA FIND ANOTHER PLACE. NO!
I'M NOT GOING THROUGH THAT AGAIN.

698
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:47,798
AND I DON'T WANT YOU
INSULTED EITHER. TURN AROUND!

699
01:01:47,822 --> 01:01:49,933
THEY'RE ALL RESTRICTED
HOTELS ALONG HERE.

700
01:01:49,957 --> 01:01:52,858
IT'LL BE THE SAME NO
MATTER WHERE WE GO.

701
01:01:56,864 --> 01:01:59,965
THEY SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED
TO TREAT PEOPLE LIKE THAT.

702
01:02:00,034 --> 01:02:02,079
GOT THE RIGHT TO DO
ANYTHING THEY WANT.

703
01:02:02,103 --> 01:02:05,143
BUT THEY'RE WRONG, AND YOU SHOULD'VE
TOLD HIM THAT! WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL HIM?

704
01:02:05,189 --> 01:02:07,673
TELL THEM WHAT,
GERT? TELL THEM WHAT?

705
01:02:07,742 --> 01:02:11,010
IF PEOPLE WANT TO TAKE THAT ATTITUDE
WITH YOU, YOU CAN'T TELL THEM ANYTHING!

706
01:02:11,078 --> 01:02:13,056
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, THERE'S
NOTHING YOU CAN TELL THEM?

707
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:15,447
THEY PULL THAT ON ME
AND I TELL 'EM WHAT I AM.

708
01:02:15,516 --> 01:02:18,717
NOBODY MAKES A JEW OUTTA
ME AND GETS AWAY WITH IT.

710
01:02:24,659 --> 01:02:26,859
[Gertrude] WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

711
01:02:26,927 --> 01:02:31,196
THERE'S A-A LITTLE STATE
PARK UP THE ROAD HERE.

712
01:02:31,265 --> 01:02:34,232
WE'LL HAVE LUNCH.
WE'LL SIT BY THE LAKE.

713
01:02:34,301 --> 01:02:37,941
I DON'T WANNA SIT BY THE LAKE. I
CANNOT GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN TODAY!

714
01:02:37,972 --> 01:02:40,172
NOW STOP IT!

718
01:02:56,023 --> 01:02:59,291

LARGE ORDER OF CLAMS FOR TWO.

720

THAT'S AN ORDER OF CLAMS FOR
TWO, SIR. OKAY. ANYTHING ELSE?

721
01:03:06,433 --> 01:03:08,500
NO, NOT JUST YET.
WE'LL SEE AS WE GO.

722
01:03:08,569 --> 01:03:10,502
OKAY.

723
01:03:10,571 --> 01:03:13,411

SAID SOMETHING TO HIM.

<i>[Gertrude] NO! NO! THAT'S
TOO COLD! I DON'T CARE.</i>

732
01:03:41,869 --> 01:03:44,336

741
01:04:30,151 --> 01:04:33,051
YES, WE DID. WE HAD
A WONDERFUL TIME.

742
01:04:38,058 --> 01:04:39,992
SO I FOUND OUT WHAT HAPPENED.

743
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:42,706
YOUR MOTHER TOLD ME THAT
FINKELSTEIN GOT IN A FIGHT WITH SOME GUY...

744

NEWSPAPERS ON SUNDAY.

745
01:04:45,332 --> 01:04:47,265
WAS HE HURT? NO.

746
01:04:47,334 --> 01:04:49,601
THEY FELL AGAINST A
WINDOW AND IT CRACKED.

747
01:04:49,670 --> 01:04:53,105
SHE SAID SHE SAW IT FROM HERE.
THE WHOLE BLOCK WAS WATCHING.

748
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:57,242
SHE TOLD ME ABOUT FRED.

749
01:04:57,310 --> 01:05:01,212
THE TWO OF YOU USED TO GET TOGETHER AND
TALK, VISIT WITH EACH OTHER IN HIS CELLAR.

750
01:05:01,281 --> 01:05:03,715
YOU DON'T DO IT ANYMORE? MM-HMM.

751
01:05:03,784 --> 01:05:06,262
AND HE'S A UNION CRUSADER? I
KNOW HE'S A UNION CRUSADER.

752
01:05:06,286 --> 01:05:08,431
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME THAT, LULLY.

753
01:05:08,455 --> 01:05:13,025
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME THAT HE INVITED
YOU TO A MEETING AND YOU DIDN'T GO.

754
01:05:13,093 --> 01:05:15,071
AND ABOUT THE GARBAGE CANS.

755
01:05:15,095 --> 01:05:17,073
I ASKED FRED ABOUT
THE GARBAGE CANS.

756
01:05:17,097 --> 01:05:19,475
AND WHAT DID HE SAY? HE
DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

757
01:05:19,499 --> 01:05:22,801
OH, LULLY! THAT'S
PART OF THEIR TACTIC.

758
01:05:22,870 --> 01:05:25,849
FIRST WITH THE GARBAGE CAN, AND
THEN THEY BLOW OUT A WINDOW OR TWO.

759
01:05:25,873 --> 01:05:28,974
NOT MY WINDOW, THEY'RE NOT.

760
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:34,780
- WHO ARE THEY?
- I DON'T KNOW.

761
01:05:34,848 --> 01:05:37,783

NO, JUST NEXT DOOR.

765
01:05:50,130 --> 01:05:51,897

COME INSIDE.

767
01:06:09,083 --> 01:06:11,282
THERE'S SOME THINGS
I DIDN'T TELL YOU.

768
01:06:11,351 --> 01:06:14,552
AND MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE, BUT THERE
ARE THINGS YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME EITHER.

769
01:06:14,621 --> 01:06:17,100
WHAT THINGS? WHAT HAVEN'T I
TOLD YOU? ABOUT THE GARBAGE CAN.

770
01:06:17,124 --> 01:06:19,825
AND YOU DIDN'T TELL ME THE UNION
CRUSADERS ARE ALIVE AROUND HERE.

771
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:22,560
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY IT'S IMPORTANT.

772
01:06:22,629 --> 01:06:24,562
WE GOTTA STOP
FOOLING AROUND HERE!

773
01:06:24,631 --> 01:06:26,792

ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

776
01:06:32,005 --> 01:06:35,040
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, WHAT AM I
TALKING ABOUT? I JUST TOLD YOU.

777
01:06:35,109 --> 01:06:38,509
AND YOU HEARD ME. LOOK.

778
01:06:38,578 --> 01:06:42,981
I WAS OUT SHOPPING, AND I HEARD THE PEOPLE
TALKING ABOUT THIS MEETING NEXT SATURDAY.

779
01:06:43,050 --> 01:06:44,983
LULLY, YOU SHOULD GO.

780
01:06:45,052 --> 01:06:46,985
I DON'T KNOW.

781
01:06:47,054 --> 01:06:49,604
ALL RIGHT, DON'T GO.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO.

782
01:06:49,673 --> 01:06:52,753
<i>BUT WE GET IN OR WE GET
OUT. THAT'S THE ONLY CHOICE.</i>

783
01:06:52,810 --> 01:06:55,243
HOW DO YOU KNOW SO MUCH
ABOUT THE UNION CRUSADERS?

784
01:06:55,312 --> 01:06:59,330
- I JUST KNOW, OKAY?
- HOW?

785
01:07:01,368 --> 01:07:04,970
THAT GUY I TOLD YOU I WORKED FOR
IN HOLLYWOOD, THE DOG GROOMER...

786
01:07:05,038 --> 01:07:07,038
I LIVED WITH HIM, LULLY.

787
01:07:08,909 --> 01:07:11,888
<i>I DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING
ELSE, SO I STAYED.</i>

788
01:07:11,912 --> 01:07:14,913
<i>I STAYED FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS.</i>

789

HE'S A UNION CRUSADER.

791
01:07:23,757 --> 01:07:26,191
<i>SO I HEARD A LOT.</i>

792
01:07:27,494 --> 01:07:30,495
<i>THEN THEY STARTED
BEATIN' UP ON JEWS,</i>

793
01:07:30,563 --> 01:07:32,742
<i>AND THE POLICE CAME AROUND.</i>

794
01:07:32,766 --> 01:07:35,246
<i>I'D HAD ENOUGH, SO I GOT OUT.</i>

795
01:07:35,302 --> 01:07:39,570
BUT I DIDN'T GET OUT BEFORE I
GOT TO KNOW THOSE PEOPLE, LULLY.

796
01:07:39,639 --> 01:07:42,073
THAT FAT GUY WE SAW DOWNSTAIRS,

797
01:07:42,142 --> 01:07:44,709
<i>I SAW HIM IN L.A.</i>

<i>HIS NAME'S MEL.</i>

THEY DON'T BRING
HIM IN UNLESS THEY...

801
01:07:55,255 --> 01:07:57,233
IT'S GONNA GET REAL DANGEROUS.

802
01:07:57,257 --> 01:08:00,591
<i>OKAY? THEY GOT
RIFLES, THEY GOT BOMBS.</i>

I SEEN THERE WHAT HAPPENED.

916
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:49,160
I FIGURE THAT THEY'LL COME TO ME
ANYWAY, SO FIRST I'LL GO TO THEM.

917
01:15:49,229 --> 01:15:53,097

01:16:01,774 --> 01:16:04,675
ALL KINDS, FROM COMMUNIST

IT'S MY NATURE I
SHOULDN'T BE HAPPY...

923
01:16:07,247 --> 01:16:09,680
UNLESS I CAN UNDERSTAND
WHAT IS GOING ON.

924
01:16:11,184 --> 01:16:13,618
WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND
IS HOW SO MANY PEOPLE...

925
01:16:13,686 --> 01:16:16,120
CAN GET WORKED UP TO
SUCH A PITCH ABOUT JEWS,

926
01:16:16,189 --> 01:16:19,034
WHEN IN THAT WHOLE HALL THERE AIN'T A
PERSON WHO KNOWS HIMSELF PERSONALLY...

927
01:16:19,058 --> 01:16:21,125
MAYBE MORE THAN
THREE JEWS TO SPEAK TO.

928
01:16:21,194 --> 01:16:23,172
MOST OF THEM AREN'T
VERY INTELLIGENT.

929
01:16:23,196 --> 01:16:25,896
YEAH, BUT SOME THERE LOOK
MORE INTELLIGENT THAN ME.

930
01:16:25,965 --> 01:16:28,732
I-I WANNA LAY THINGS OUT
ON THE BOARD, MR. NEWMAN.

931
01:16:28,801 --> 01:16:31,302
IF YOU DON'T MIND, YOU
CAN DISCUSS WITH ME.

932
01:16:31,371 --> 01:16:33,804
WHY DO YOU WANT ME TO GET
OUT OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD?

933
01:16:33,873 --> 01:16:36,985
IT ISN'T YOU, PARTICULARLY.
IT IS ME PARTICULARLY.

934
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:39,977
IF YOU WANT THE JEWS TO GET
OUT, YOU WANT ME TO GET OUT.

935
01:16:40,046 --> 01:16:42,146
I DID SOMETHIN' YOU DON'T LIKE?

936
01:16:42,215 --> 01:16:46,150
IT ISN'T A QUESTION OF DOING
SOMETHING I DON'T LIKE. YES, THEN, WHAT?

937
01:16:46,219 --> 01:16:48,330
YOU DON'T REALLY WANT
TO KNOW THIS, DO YOU?

938
01:16:48,354 --> 01:16:51,989
WHY, DON'T YOU WANT TO TELL
ME? NO, I'LL TELL YOU IF YOU WANT.

939
01:16:52,058 --> 01:16:54,758
THERE'S LOTS OF REASONS
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THE JEWS.

940
01:16:54,827 --> 01:16:57,928
UH, FOR ONE THING, THEY HAVE
NO PRINCIPLES. PRINCIPLES?

941
01:16:57,997 --> 01:17:00,142
YES. IN BUSINESS, FOR INSTANCE,

942
01:17:00,166 --> 01:17:02,600
YOU'LL FIND THEM CHEATING
OR TAKING ADVANTAGE.

943
01:17:02,669 --> 01:17:05,236
LET ME UNDERSTAND. YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT ME NOW?

944
01:17:05,305 --> 01:17:08,206
NO, NO, I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT YOU. SOME, YOU MEAN.

945
01:17:08,274 --> 01:17:10,386
OF COURSE I'M NOT
TALKING ABOUT YOU.

946
01:17:10,410 --> 01:17:12,710
THEN SOME GENTILES, NO?

947
01:17:12,778 --> 01:17:15,413
OF COURSE, YES.
SOME GENTILES, YES.

948
01:17:15,481 --> 01:17:18,849
YOU EVER PUT A NICKEL IN FOR A
LOCAL CALL? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

949
01:17:18,918 --> 01:17:21,852
THE PHONE COMPANY COULD MAKE
A GOOD PROFIT CHARGING A PENNY.

950
01:17:21,921 --> 01:17:24,522
THIS IS A FACT FROM THE
UTILITIES INVESTIGATION.

951
01:17:24,591 --> 01:17:27,358
THE PHONE COMPANY IS
RUN AND OWNED BY GENTILES,

952
01:17:27,427 --> 01:17:29,360
BUT SHOULD I HOLD
YOU RESPONSIBLE?

953
01:17:29,429 --> 01:17:31,862
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
IT ISN'T WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

954
01:17:31,931 --> 01:17:34,798
IT'S WHAT OTHERS OF
YOUR PEOPLE HAVE DONE.

955
01:17:34,867 --> 01:17:38,269
SO, IN OTHER WORDS, WHEN YOU
LOOK AT ME, YOU DON'T SEE ME.

956
01:17:38,338 --> 01:17:41,505
I DON'T SEE YOU?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

957
01:17:41,574 --> 01:17:43,641
I MEAN WHAT I SAID.

958
01:17:43,710 --> 01:17:47,411
YOU LOOK AT ME AND
YOU DON'T SEE ME.

959
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:49,913
SO WHAT DO YOU SEE, MR. NEWMAN?

960
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:53,351
I...

961
01:17:59,726 --> 01:18:02,660
WHAT HAPPENED? YOU'RE
ALL DIRTY. I'LL WASH LATER.

962
01:18:02,729 --> 01:18:05,969
LAWRENCE, YOU'RE CUT! I WAS
SITTING THERE WITH SOME MORON.

963
01:18:06,031 --> 01:18:07,964
HE STARTED YELLING AT ME.

964
01:18:08,033 --> 01:18:10,468
WHY? WHAT'D YOU
DO? I DIDN'T DO A THING.

965
01:18:10,536 --> 01:18:12,514
HE-HE SAW I WASN'T APPLAUDING.

966
01:18:12,538 --> 01:18:15,551
I NEVER APPLAUD. YOU KNOW
THAT. <i>BUT DID YOU TELL HIM THAT?</i>

967
01:18:15,575 --> 01:18:18,442
HOW CAN YOU TELL
THOSE MORONS ANYTHING?

968
01:18:18,511 --> 01:18:21,579
THEY WENT CRAZY
AND SHOVED ME OUT.

969
01:18:21,648 --> 01:18:23,626
SO YOU DIDN'T STAY TO THE END?

970
01:18:23,650 --> 01:18:27,585
THEY PUSHED ME OUT,
FOR PETE'S SAKE! RIGHT.

YOU A FEW THINGS.

1038
01:23:24,583 --> 01:23:27,818
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE
GOING TO DO IF THEY COME AFTER YOU?

1039
01:23:27,887 --> 01:23:30,365
YOU GOT SOME DEFINITE INFORMATION
THEY'RE GONNA START WITH ME?

1041
01:23:32,391 --> 01:23:36,026
I DON'T KNOW WHEN, BUT IT'S
GOING TO COME. WHAT WILL YOU DO?

1042
01:23:44,236 --> 01:23:48,238
THIS IS WHAT THEY CALL A
LOUISVILLE SLUGGER. SOLID WOOD.

1043
01:23:48,307 --> 01:23:50,941
WHAT ABOUT THE
POLICE? THE POLICE, SURE.

1044
01:23:51,009 --> 01:23:53,710

DELEGATION TO COMPLAIN.

1045

ON THIS BLOCK?

1046
01:23:56,381 --> 01:23:59,450

1047
01:23:59,518 --> 01:24:01,618

SENSIBLE THING FOR YOU TO DO.

1049
01:24:05,658 --> 01:24:08,325

TO THINK ABOUT MOVING.

1050

<i>IT'S MY HONEST OPINION.</i>

1051
01:24:16,802 --> 01:24:19,069
ARE YOU A JEW, MR. NEWMAN?

1052
01:24:19,137 --> 01:24:22,105
NO, BUT THEY THINK
YOU ARE, RIGHT? WELL...

1053
01:24:22,174 --> 01:24:24,532

TO MOVE? MR. FINKELSTEIN,

I THOUGHT NO MATTER WHAT YOU
DID, YOU WERE STILL MY FRIEND...

1057
01:24:31,817 --> 01:24:35,118
BECAUSE YOU WERE A MAN OF
INTELLIGENCE. I DIDN'T COME HERE TO...

1058

SEE WHAT THEY'RE DOING?

1064
01:24:51,937 --> 01:24:54,816

HAD ANY REGARD FOR YOUR COUNTRY,

1065
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:57,273
YOU WOULDN'T TELL ME TO MOVE.

1066
01:24:59,678 --> 01:25:02,178
I WILL NOT MOVE, MR. NEWMAN.

1067
01:25:03,983 --> 01:25:07,918
I WILL NOT DO IT. I WON'T!

1068
01:25:16,094 --> 01:25:19,362
I SIMPLY WAS
TRYING... NO, I WILL NOT!

1069
