Oh.

( giggling )

14
00:01:45,466 --> 00:01:48,367
Mine shakes

15
00:01:48,402 --> 00:01:50,836
Have you heard of this new thing where
you can get your asshole bleached?

16
00:01:50,871 --> 00:01:53,169
- Ew.
- No, l'm serious.

17
00:01:53,207 --> 00:01:54,902
lt's like this new thing

18
00:01:54,942 --> 00:01:57,706
lt first started with strippers
and porn stars,

19
00:01:57,745 --> 00:01:59,110
but now, like,
everybody is doing it.

20
00:01:59,146 --> 00:02:00,773
You know, it just kind of
lightens the color.

21
00:02:00,815 --> 00:02:02,544
See how mine's a little darker?

22
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:05,177
Get your butthole out of my face.

24
00:02:07,788 --> 00:02:09,346
- Really?
- Yeah.

25
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,223
You know, we should find a place
here in the mall who does it.

26
00:02:12,259 --> 00:02:14,693
Uh-huh.
Your butt looks okay to me.

27
00:02:14,728 --> 00:02:16,389
Yeah, you coming onto me now?

28
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,762

Oh, did l forget

00:02:31,612 --> 00:02:33,978
Hmm, l must be losing my mind.

35
00:02:34,014 --> 00:02:35,777
Come on, Sherri, don't.
We're just gonna get caught.

Let's go.
Come on.

A little after-school shopping are we?

We're gonna go home right away

50
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,108

l'm always holding the bag.

00:03:36,911 --> 00:03:38,811
Here's my wife.

00:03:43,517 --> 00:03:45,451
- Hello.
- Have you met my wife before?

56
00:03:45,486 --> 00:03:48,011
Once at a school play,
but you weren't so...

57
00:03:48,055 --> 00:03:51,218
Oh, no kidding.
Only five more weeks.

58
00:03:51,258 --> 00:03:54,386
- Yeah, wow. Epidural, huh?
- Yeah.

59
00:03:54,428 --> 00:03:57,488
Well, speaking of going,
we have to go 'cause we're gonna be late.

60
00:03:57,531 --> 00:04:00,261
My dad's picking us up
so we'll see you in class.

61
00:04:00,301 --> 00:04:01,791
- l hope so.
- Bye, Mr. Krebbs.

62
00:04:01,835 --> 00:04:03,735

- See you. Bye.

63
00:04:03,771 --> 00:04:05,500
( groans )

64
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:07,166
Honey, let's get those towels
and get out of here.

65
00:04:07,207 --> 00:04:08,640
My back is killing me.

66
00:04:11,278 --> 00:04:13,508
Hey, wait!
Hey! Hey!

67
00:04:15,683 --> 00:04:17,617
Missed 'em.

68
00:04:17,651 --> 00:04:19,676
Poor Mr. Krebbs.

69
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,984
He has to be stuck
with that fat ugly pig.

70
00:04:22,022 --> 00:04:23,489
Dude, she's pregnant.

71
00:04:23,524 --> 00:04:25,958
What is he doing with her anyway?

72
00:04:25,993 --> 00:04:28,621
He was so wanting
to fuck us just then.

73
00:04:28,662 --> 00:04:30,027
Ew, he's like 50.

74
00:04:30,064 --> 00:04:33,158
- No, try like his 30s, dumbass.
- Whatever.

75
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,838
No, he was checking us out.

76
00:04:38,872 --> 00:04:40,806
l think he's kind of hot.

77
00:04:40,841 --> 00:04:42,308
- Oh shit.
- ( alarm blaring )

78
00:04:42,343 --> 00:04:44,937
- Did anybody see?
- No, just go.

79
00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:46,469
Oh my God.

80
00:04:48,048 --> 00:04:50,676
( laughing )

81
00:04:50,718 --> 00:04:52,242
Yes.

82
00:04:54,722 --> 00:04:57,919
Woman on P.A.:
Tony, could you come to towels, please?

83
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:00,358
Tony, these folks are giving
towels as a gift

84
00:05:00,394 --> 00:05:02,328
and they want to know
what our exchange policy is.

85
00:05:02,363 --> 00:05:05,161

- Oh, l'm afraid not.

86
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,723
- No, sorry.
- That's what l was afraid of.

87
00:05:06,767 --> 00:05:08,029
We don't give cash back anymore.

88
00:05:08,068 --> 00:05:10,628
But they can get credit to use
anywhere in the store.

89
00:05:10,671 --> 00:05:12,502
And you can use it
not just at this store

90
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:14,837
but any of our stores

91
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,399

- Have a good one, guys.
- Okay, take care, you guys.

100
00:05:34,128 --> 00:05:36,028
That's why we have the towels.

101
00:05:38,165 --> 00:05:39,928
You are so bad.

102
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,026
lt's not my fault.
You're wearing those pants again.

103
00:05:42,069 --> 00:05:44,060
That guy's so funny.

104
00:05:44,104 --> 00:05:47,437
- Oh, so you like Mr. Slick Manager guy?
- Yeah, right.

106
00:05:50,844 --> 00:05:52,243
No.

107
00:05:54,515 --> 00:05:56,210
You're not wearing any underwear?

108
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,718
l am barebacking it
all the way.

109
00:05:58,752 --> 00:06:01,516
You are like a little vixen.

110
00:06:01,555 --> 00:06:03,455
A little minx.

111
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:06,516
Put you in our company
catalogue and eat you up.

112
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,187
Come into the storeroom
with me right now.

113
00:06:08,228 --> 00:06:10,594
- You are crazy.
- Come on, who's gonna know?

114
00:06:10,631 --> 00:06:12,223
Forget it.

115
00:06:12,266 --> 00:06:14,291
You liked it last time, didn't you?

116
00:06:14,334 --> 00:06:16,894
No, l hated every second of it.
All four of them.

117
00:06:16,937 --> 00:06:18,928
- Oh, right.
- Now go away.

118
00:06:18,972 --> 00:06:20,997
You're gonna get us fired.
Go.

119
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:23,635
Who cares?
This place sucks.

120
00:06:23,677 --> 00:06:25,474
- We'll get better jobs.
- Yeah?

121
00:06:25,512 --> 00:06:28,811

You could be my assistant.

122
00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:31,511
- There's big money in magic.
- Yeah, sure.

123
00:06:31,552 --> 00:06:33,213
Great.

124
00:06:33,253 --> 00:06:35,983
What, you don't trust me with a saw
and the whole cutting-you-in-half routine?

125
00:06:36,023 --> 00:06:38,184
Stop it.

126
00:06:38,225 --> 00:06:40,955
lf you're such a good magician
why don't you just disappear?

127
00:06:40,994 --> 00:06:42,689
Okay?

128
00:06:44,698 --> 00:06:46,563
The store is empty.

129
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,363
Just take your break now.

130
00:06:48,402 --> 00:06:51,030
- l promise l'll be quick.
- Oh, l know you'll be quick.

131

What do you say?

133
00:06:57,845 --> 00:07:00,609
Let me just tell Marian
l'm gonna take my break now.

134
00:07:00,647 --> 00:07:02,410
Thattagirl.

135

- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

136
00:07:07,154 --> 00:07:08,678
Can you help me?

137
00:07:08,722 --> 00:07:10,952
- My wife is redoing the bathroom...
- Uh-huh.

138
00:07:10,991 --> 00:07:13,221
...and she wants it to be
pretty much like this.

139

Okay.

140
00:07:14,895 --> 00:07:17,728
You know, she wants
to cover the toilet.

141
00:07:17,765 --> 00:07:21,064
Okay. We're gonna have to take
inventory a little bit later.

So you take care.
Okay.

l notice you have
different kinds of blues.

145
00:07:26,507 --> 00:07:28,941
Yes, we do.
We have the aqua.

146
00:07:28,976 --> 00:07:31,604

lsn't that the perfect
color on her, Grace?

153
00:07:47,394 --> 00:07:49,021
Oh, absolutely.

154
00:07:49,062 --> 00:07:52,031
The earth tones definitely

155
00:07:52,065 --> 00:07:53,999
- Really?
- lt really is great.

156

Are you okay?

174
00:09:34,735 --> 00:09:36,965
No, l'm not okay,
you stupid bitch.

175
00:09:37,004 --> 00:09:39,495
l'm so sorry.

176
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:41,200
Listen, it was an accident.

177
00:09:41,241 --> 00:09:44,074
Accident?
l'll show you accident.

178
00:09:44,111 --> 00:09:46,272
( screams )

179
00:09:47,814 --> 00:09:49,782
Here's your accident.

180
00:09:50,984 --> 00:09:54,010
Fucking step down, you fuck.

181
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:59,085
Can l help you?

182
00:09:59,126 --> 00:10:01,117
Cut! Cut!
Fuck!

183
00:10:01,161 --> 00:10:02,890
- Dan, deal with this.
- Cut cut.

184
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,625
Sir, excuse me.
We're in the middle of a movie.

185
00:10:12,272 --> 00:10:14,035
( Muzak playing )

186
00:10:14,074 --> 00:10:16,042
( farts )

187
00:10:22,549 --> 00:10:24,483
( dings )

188
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:49,872
( dings )

189
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,945
Hey, Marty.
How are you doing?

190
00:10:54,982 --> 00:10:56,381
Hey, Stephanie.

191
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,179
l'd be doing a lot better if

192
00:10:58,218 --> 00:11:00,846
the ATM machine
hadn't eaten my card.

193
00:11:00,887 --> 00:11:02,718
Okay.

194
00:11:02,756 --> 00:11:04,621
( coughs )

195
00:11:04,658 --> 00:11:06,626
So, um...

196
00:11:14,835 --> 00:11:16,928
( dings )

197
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:20,904
God.

198
00:11:20,941 --> 00:11:24,104
Oh my God.
l swear to God l'm gonna throw up.

199
00:11:24,144 --> 00:11:26,977
l'm gonna throw up.
Oh my God! Oh my God!

200
00:11:27,014 --> 00:11:28,481
What crawled up his ass and died?

201
00:11:45,165 --> 00:11:47,326
Marty:
Phil Howard, please. Oh, hi, Phil.

202
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:49,460
We've got some good news for you.

203
00:11:49,503 --> 00:11:51,994
We reviewed your claim
and we decided

204
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:54,064
it's best just to consider
your car totaled.

205
00:11:54,107 --> 00:11:56,302
So you will be getting a check

206
00:11:56,343 --> 00:11:59,642
in the amount of $4,552.

207
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:02,944
Of course you'll be responsible
for the $500 deductable.

208
00:12:07,354 --> 00:12:09,549
( coughs )

209
00:12:10,991 --> 00:12:13,425
l'm sorry, Phil.
Can l just call you right back, please?

210
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,223
Thank you very much.

211
00:12:26,673 --> 00:12:29,039
( talking quietly )

212
00:12:31,344 --> 00:12:33,471
( spitting )

213
00:12:49,729 --> 00:12:52,129
( gagging )

214
00:12:54,201 --> 00:12:56,465
You are an A-hole, Stuart.

215
00:12:56,503 --> 00:12:58,494
Marty, can't you see l'm working?

216
00:12:58,538 --> 00:13:02,167
l am tired of your practical jokes.

217
00:13:02,209 --> 00:13:04,006
What the hell did you
put into my Coke?

218
00:13:04,044 --> 00:13:06,171
ln your Coke?
You're crazy.

219
00:13:06,213 --> 00:13:08,875
Just stop it.
Just leave me alone.

220
00:13:08,915 --> 00:13:11,281
l don't know what the hell
you're talking about, okay?

221
00:13:11,318 --> 00:13:13,286
ls there a problem, gentlemen?

222
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,550
Mr. Stonecipher,

223
00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:18,319
l am tired of Stuart
and his practical jokes.

224
00:13:18,358 --> 00:13:21,589
l try to be professional
and l try to do a good job,

225
00:13:21,628 --> 00:13:24,153
but he won't stop torturing me.

226
00:13:24,197 --> 00:13:26,825
Mr. Stonecipher, that's not true.
l mean, he's insane.

227
00:13:26,867 --> 00:13:28,664
lnsane?

228
00:13:28,702 --> 00:13:33,469
He put pickle juice or something
in my Coke while l was down at the ATM.

229
00:13:33,507 --> 00:13:36,271
Then when l came back l drank it,
l thought l'd been poisoned.

230
00:13:36,309 --> 00:13:38,300
- Pickle juice?
- Yeah, okay--

231
00:13:40,647 --> 00:13:42,740
Smell.

232
00:13:49,589 --> 00:13:51,250
That's Coke, Marty.

233
00:13:57,397 --> 00:13:59,331
What?

234
00:14:14,414 --> 00:14:16,644
All right, how's that?
Can you see everything?

235
00:14:16,683 --> 00:14:19,447
Move it to the left a little bit
so you can see the whole couch.

236
00:14:19,486 --> 00:14:21,477
- My left or your left?
- Your left.

237
00:14:21,521 --> 00:14:24,979
No no, my left. Sorry.

238
00:14:25,025 --> 00:14:26,720
Yeah, it's completely hidden.

239
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,591
l mean, l know it's there
and l can hardly see it.

240
00:14:28,628 --> 00:14:31,893
All right, good. l'm gonna do the one
in the nursery after dinner in the bear.

241
00:14:31,932 --> 00:14:33,194
Good.

242
00:14:33,233 --> 00:14:35,167
Not in the bear.
That's gonna be the first place she looks.

243
00:14:35,202 --> 00:14:37,693
- She'll never look there.
- Nannies are hip to this stuff.

244
00:14:37,737 --> 00:14:39,227
She's gonna be looking
for the nanny-cams.

245
00:14:39,272 --> 00:14:42,298
Having a complete stranger come into
the house and take care of the baby

246
00:14:42,342 --> 00:14:44,276
makes me very nervous.

247
00:14:44,311 --> 00:14:46,506
The last time was a sign
not to do it again.

248
00:14:46,546 --> 00:14:48,309
Yeah, well, we have cameras now.

249
00:14:48,348 --> 00:14:51,476
Oh good, so when we come home
and we find the baby's got a broken neck

250
00:14:51,518 --> 00:14:53,349
we can just rewind the tape and say,

251
00:14:53,386 --> 00:14:55,513
''Oh look, there's the nanny
shaking the baby.''

252
00:14:55,555 --> 00:14:58,080
- You decapitated it.
- No l didn't.

253
00:14:58,124 --> 00:14:59,614
lt's okay, l can fix it.

254
00:15:00,627 --> 00:15:02,754
There you go.
All right, what do you say?

255
00:15:02,796 --> 00:15:05,128
l see this shit every day.

256
00:15:05,165 --> 00:15:07,793
Ben, you see?
l told you.

257
00:15:07,834 --> 00:15:09,495
Megan, please don't say
words like that.

258
00:15:09,536 --> 00:15:12,403
- You know what l would love?
- What's that?

259
00:15:12,439 --> 00:15:16,068
l would really love for you
to make the salad.

260
00:15:16,109 --> 00:15:17,440
Okay.

261
00:15:17,477 --> 00:15:20,105
No no, huh-uh, Megan.
Don't touch the soft spot.

262
00:15:20,146 --> 00:15:21,670
Remember, we talked
about that, okay?

263
00:15:21,715 --> 00:15:24,183
But l was only touching it softly.

264
00:15:24,217 --> 00:15:26,412
l know, but you
shouldn't touch it at all.

265
00:15:26,453 --> 00:15:29,115
You know what?
We don't need this on while it's just us.

266
00:15:33,526 --> 00:15:35,289
Whip it good.

267
00:15:39,966 --> 00:15:43,402
- ( coughing )
- ( laughing )

268
00:15:56,549 --> 00:15:59,518
- ( coughing )
- ( laughing )

269
00:16:01,321 --> 00:16:03,346
l'm done.

270
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,628
Willie:
Oh, fuck yeah, man.

271
00:16:19,906 --> 00:16:21,840
l'm gonna fucking film it.

272
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:24,469
Aw, yeah.

273
00:16:24,511 --> 00:16:26,843
How about that, man?
Would you sink it in that?

274
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,404
Carl:
Who me?

275
00:16:28,448 --> 00:16:31,417
No, l hate perfect
beautiful teenage bodies.

276
00:16:31,451 --> 00:16:33,351
ldiot.

277
00:16:35,021 --> 00:16:37,990
Oh man, she's showing us
the toothless smile.

278
00:16:38,024 --> 00:16:41,357
God, look at that bitch
in the blue top, man.

279
00:16:41,394 --> 00:16:43,385
They've been in here before, man.

280
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,489
You think they're under 18, man?

281
00:16:45,532 --> 00:16:47,022
Fuck yeah.
Way under.

282
00:16:47,067 --> 00:16:49,001
Oh, l never can fucking tell.

283
00:16:49,035 --> 00:16:51,663
They came in and l sold them
booze and smokes once.

284
00:16:51,705 --> 00:16:53,297
Oh well, fuck it.

285
00:16:55,108 --> 00:16:57,736
( sighs )

286
00:16:58,745 --> 00:17:01,043
( tires squeal )

287
00:17:02,048 --> 00:17:04,846
Tell you what:
Once l get my fucking record deal, man,

288
00:17:04,884 --> 00:17:08,047
it ain't gonna matter how old,
how fucking ugly l am.

289
00:17:08,088 --> 00:17:12,047
All these hot teenyboppers
are gonna be fucking lining up

290
00:17:12,092 --> 00:17:15,459
to gobble the grits from
my fucking groin straw, man.

291
00:17:15,495 --> 00:17:18,259
Listen to this fucking new tune.
lt's called ''Electrocuted.''

292
00:17:18,298 --> 00:17:19,856
l wrote it last night, man.

293
00:17:19,899 --> 00:17:21,730
''Electrocuted''?

294
00:17:21,768 --> 00:17:24,862
Yeah, it's about a guy's
electrocution in the death house.

295
00:17:24,904 --> 00:17:26,929
Ready?
Dig it, man.

296
00:17:26,973 --> 00:17:30,170

That was a close one.

334
00:22:20,199 --> 00:22:22,565
No, you know what?
Tony, we shouldn't do this anymore.

335
00:22:22,602 --> 00:22:25,662
lndeed.
Now bend over.

336
00:22:25,705 --> 00:22:28,105
No no, Tony.
l'm serious. l feel bad.

337
00:22:28,141 --> 00:22:30,473
Look, don't get all freaked out
just 'cause Marian came in.

338
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,068
She didn't see us.
No one suspects a thing.

No, it's not that.
l'm a mother with children.

340

All right, all the more reason
you deserve to have a little fun, you know?

You've earned it.

342

lf my husband found out,
he'd kill us both.

- What?
- Don't tell him.

345

Okay, wait. Wait.

346
00:22:48,695 --> 00:22:50,629

- Okay, whatever you say.
- You are so full of shit.

348
00:22:57,637 --> 00:22:59,730
( moaning )

349
00:22:59,772 --> 00:23:01,865
( bell ringing )

350
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,376
Quit it, Tyler.
You're gonna mess up my makeup.

351
00:23:14,287 --> 00:23:16,414
Ew, get a room.

352
00:23:16,456 --> 00:23:18,720
l've got to go, yo.
l'll text you later.

353
00:23:18,758 --> 00:23:21,386
Ahem.

354
00:23:21,427 --> 00:23:24,521
So it looks like you and Tyler
aren't a secret any longer.

355
00:23:24,564 --> 00:23:27,158
Whatever.
l'm over Tyler.

356
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,464
Already?
Yeah, it didn't look like it.

357
00:23:29,502 --> 00:23:31,470
He's an idiot.

358
00:23:31,504 --> 00:23:33,404
And he's hung like a mouse.

359
00:23:33,439 --> 00:23:35,930
l'm dumping him after
the Ludacris concert.

360
00:23:35,975 --> 00:23:38,239
- He's got tickets.
- Mmm.

361
00:23:38,277 --> 00:23:41,007
l like someone else now.

362
00:23:41,047 --> 00:23:42,514
Oh, who?

363
00:23:42,548 --> 00:23:44,812
- lt's a secret.
- From me?

364
00:23:44,851 --> 00:23:47,285
He doesn't know yet.

365
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,811
lt's a little project l'm working on.

366
00:23:49,856 --> 00:23:51,619
A project?
l like projects.

367
00:23:51,657 --> 00:23:53,887
( speaking Spanish on TV )

368
00:24:01,334 --> 00:24:03,268
- ( baby crying )
- Shh.

369
00:24:04,337 --> 00:24:06,601
lt's okay.
lt's okay.

370
00:24:06,639 --> 00:24:09,164
( reporter speaking Spanish )

371
00:24:31,597 --> 00:24:33,895
Louise, are you free for lunch?

372
00:24:33,933 --> 00:24:36,401
Oh, well, l was maybe
gonna have lunch with Ben,

373
00:24:36,435 --> 00:24:37,925
but it wasn't definite.

374
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:40,837
Let me give him a call
can l'll give you a call on email.

375
00:24:40,873 --> 00:24:42,272
- Okay, good.
- Okay? All right.

376
00:24:42,308 --> 00:24:45,209
Yeah, well, let's--

377
00:24:45,244 --> 00:24:47,212
Look, let Jerry defend him.
He's terrific.

378
00:24:47,246 --> 00:24:48,873
- Jerry?
- Yeah, and besides,

379
00:24:48,915 --> 00:24:50,883
- he loves a good challenge.
- ( phone ringing )

380
00:24:50,917 --> 00:24:53,317
Hang on.
lt's my wife.

381
00:24:53,352 --> 00:24:55,786
All right, guys,
we'll pick this up later.

382
00:24:55,822 --> 00:24:57,756
- Hey, baby, what's shaking?
- Kiss my ass.

383
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:00,384
He doesn't see enough money in it.
Fucking Jew.

384
00:25:00,426 --> 00:25:01,825
Are we on for lunch?

385
00:25:01,861 --> 00:25:05,627
Oh, sweetie, l really wanted to,
but l can't get out of my lunch meeting.

386
00:25:05,665 --> 00:25:07,724
l thought for sure it was gonna cancel.
l'm sorry.

387
00:25:07,767 --> 00:25:11,328
Oh, okay. Yeah, no problem.
l'll just see you tonight.

388
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:13,338
All right, l'll see you at home.
Bye bye.

389
00:25:13,372 --> 00:25:16,637
l love you.
Bye.

390
00:25:18,878 --> 00:25:20,607
Ben:
l'll tell you, what l'd really like to do

391
00:25:20,646 --> 00:25:22,477
is just walk away
from the whole damn practice.

392
00:25:22,515 --> 00:25:24,983
- Man: Burned out, huh?
- No, you know what it actually is?

393
00:25:25,017 --> 00:25:29,147
l'm sick of defending bad people
day in and day out.

394
00:25:29,188 --> 00:25:30,815
l mean, some of them
are really innocent,

395
00:25:30,857 --> 00:25:34,657
but the vast majority are scumbags.

396
00:25:34,694 --> 00:25:37,026
Killer walks free

397
00:25:37,063 --> 00:25:40,396
because l discovered that a cop
improperly labeled an evidence bag

398
00:25:40,433 --> 00:25:43,027
containing the bloody knife with
the guy's fingerprints all over it.

399
00:25:43,069 --> 00:25:45,060
lt's got to be thrown out.

400
00:25:45,104 --> 00:25:47,265
- You know?
- lt's tough.

401
00:25:47,306 --> 00:25:49,570
Yeah.
l envy you.

402
00:25:49,609 --> 00:25:54,103
Well, l mean, l'm in a whole
different category.

403
00:25:54,146 --> 00:25:58,310
The organizations l represent
fight for equal rights.

404
00:25:58,351 --> 00:26:00,819
You know, free speech.
Good causes, you know?

405
00:26:00,853 --> 00:26:03,287
- Mm-hmm.
- You know, when l win a case

406
00:26:03,322 --> 00:26:06,780
good decent people
get a better life.

407
00:26:06,826 --> 00:26:08,316
A fighting chance, you know?

408
00:26:08,361 --> 00:26:09,794
Hmm.

409
00:26:09,829 --> 00:26:11,956
You should do
some pro bono for us.

410
00:26:11,998 --> 00:26:14,831
Might remind you why you
became a lawyer in the first place.

411
00:26:14,867 --> 00:26:17,700
( chuckles )
Look, l do my share of pro bono.

412
00:26:17,737 --> 00:26:19,637
l can't afford to do any more.

413
00:26:19,672 --> 00:26:21,299
Yeah.

414
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:24,741
lt's funny. Having kids is what
completely shifted my values.

415
00:26:24,777 --> 00:26:26,472
You know?

416
00:26:26,512 --> 00:26:29,037
And l've got to keep the money
coming in now more than ever.

417
00:26:29,081 --> 00:26:31,777
Lately, l hate what l'm doing,

418
00:26:31,817 --> 00:26:34,251
but l'm kind of stuck for a while.

419
00:26:34,287 --> 00:26:37,620
Well, you know,
l hear that professionals

420
00:26:37,657 --> 00:26:39,682
change their careers two to three
times in a lifetime.

421
00:26:39,725 --> 00:26:41,056
So do something else.

422
00:26:41,093 --> 00:26:42,822
Yeah, right.

423
00:26:46,332 --> 00:26:48,197
Want to get out of here?

424
00:26:48,234 --> 00:26:50,168
Yeah, let's do it.

425
00:27:39,952 --> 00:27:41,419
Hey, Stephanie.

426
00:27:41,487 --> 00:27:43,182
Hey, Marty.

427
00:27:44,957 --> 00:27:47,187
( groans )
Let's see here.

428
00:27:48,294 --> 00:27:49,955
Mind if l join you?

429
00:27:49,996 --> 00:27:52,556
- Help yourself.
- ( groans )

430
00:27:58,571 --> 00:28:00,903
Good old PB&J.

431
00:28:02,675 --> 00:28:05,371
When l was little l used to put
potato chips right into the sandwich.

432
00:28:05,411 --> 00:28:07,208
- You ever do that?
- Nope.

433
00:28:08,414 --> 00:28:11,178
You know, more people
are allergic to peanuts

434
00:28:11,217 --> 00:28:13,913
than any other food.

435
00:28:13,953 --> 00:28:16,319
l'm allergic to cats.

436
00:28:16,355 --> 00:28:19,654
l had this girlfriend this one time,
she had four cats.

437
00:28:19,692 --> 00:28:22,422
- lt was murder.
- ( sighs )

438
00:28:22,461 --> 00:28:24,622
You have any cats?

439
00:28:24,663 --> 00:28:26,153
Nope.

440
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:32,767
( laughing )

441
00:28:35,508 --> 00:28:37,305
Poor Marty.

442
00:28:37,977 --> 00:28:40,502
( tools clanging )

443
00:28:40,546 --> 00:28:43,913
What's with this crappy car?

444
00:28:43,949 --> 00:28:46,179
( laughing )

445
00:28:46,218 --> 00:28:49,676
You know, people are really crazy
for, like, little cat knickknacks

446
00:28:49,722 --> 00:28:53,123
and, like, little, you know,
cat-related doodads.

447
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:56,185
lf you could figure out a way
to tap into that market,

448
00:28:56,228 --> 00:28:58,696
you'd be laughing
all the way to the bank.

449
00:29:00,266 --> 00:29:02,131
l had an idea once for, like, a little--

450
00:29:02,168 --> 00:29:05,729
it was, like, a beverage, like, you know,
orange soda or grape soda or something.

451
00:29:07,206 --> 00:29:10,903
But it had a little car character on it

452
00:29:10,943 --> 00:29:13,844
and it was called Catatonic.

453
00:29:15,247 --> 00:29:17,078
You know, 'cause it--

454
00:29:20,886 --> 00:29:23,377
You know, l guess a lot of people

455
00:29:23,422 --> 00:29:25,822
probably have really good ideas

456
00:29:25,858 --> 00:29:28,019
but the difference is

457
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,891
distribution

458
00:29:29,929 --> 00:29:32,193
and getting them out there,
you know?

459
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,000
l have a funny joke for you.

460
00:29:36,035 --> 00:29:39,198
What did Catwoman's husband

461
00:29:39,238 --> 00:29:41,399
leave in the litter box for her?

462
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,738
Katmandu.

463
00:29:45,244 --> 00:29:47,371
Get it?
Like doo-doo.

464
00:29:52,118 --> 00:29:55,019
- Hey, do you like movies?
- Nope.

465
00:29:55,054 --> 00:29:58,319
Oh, okay, yeah.
l didn't think so.

466
00:29:58,357 --> 00:30:01,053
Um, actually that's why
l was thinking instead

467
00:30:01,093 --> 00:30:04,392
maybe sometime if you weren't--
if you were interested

468
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:07,194
if you wanted to maybe,
like, get dinner or something,

469
00:30:07,233 --> 00:30:08,996
you know, somewhere

470
00:30:09,034 --> 00:30:11,525
just as, um, you know,
as an idea.

471
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:13,197
- Hey.
- Hey.

472
00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:22,613
Okay.

473
00:30:25,184 --> 00:30:26,879
Well.

474
00:30:33,192 --> 00:30:34,887
Okay, l'm shoving off.

475
00:30:34,927 --> 00:30:37,361
See you later, Marty.

476
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:42,431
My God, l can't believe
you guys just missed that.

477
00:30:42,468 --> 00:30:45,198
He just completely hit on me.
He asked me on a date.

478
00:30:45,237 --> 00:30:47,637
- ( laughing )
- Farty Marty.

479
00:30:47,673 --> 00:30:50,073
Sherri:
Oh, hey, Mr. Krebbs.

480
00:30:50,109 --> 00:30:51,906
- Hey.
- Mr. Bates.

481
00:30:51,944 --> 00:30:54,174
Mr. Krebbs, thanks again

482
00:30:54,213 --> 00:30:56,113
for recommending
''Marjorie Morningstar.''

483
00:30:56,148 --> 00:30:58,810
- Oh yeah.
- l'm loving it. lt's so romantic.

484
00:30:58,851 --> 00:31:01,183
l knew you were looking for
a good book and you want to be an actor

485
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,552
- so it seemed like a perfect fit. Hi.
- Hi.

486
00:31:03,589 --> 00:31:05,454
lt is.
l'm almost done.

487
00:31:05,491 --> 00:31:07,288
Good.

488
00:31:07,326 --> 00:31:09,954
Well, see you.

489
00:31:09,995 --> 00:31:11,792
See you later.

490
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,764
My God, did you see those nipples?

491
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:16,233
Look at those asses.
l think l'm gonna blow right now.

492
00:31:16,268 --> 00:31:17,963
- Oh my God.
- Come on.

493
00:31:18,003 --> 00:31:20,437
Don't tell me you haven't thought about
bending these girls over a chair.

494
00:31:20,472 --> 00:31:22,770
- Do you know how old they are?
- My uncle once said it best:

495
00:31:22,808 --> 00:31:25,003
lf there's grass on the field,
play ball.

496
00:31:25,044 --> 00:31:27,205
- That your uncle that died in prison?
- Oh, that's very funny.

497
00:31:27,246 --> 00:31:31,205
Seriously, l'd like to fuck the living shit
out of that little bitch.

498
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:32,740
Oh my God.

499
00:31:32,785 --> 00:31:36,221
You know, Barry, getting out
of high school,

500
00:31:36,255 --> 00:31:38,052
l've been around these
teenagers for decades.

501
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,682
They know exactly
what they're doing.

502
00:31:39,725 --> 00:31:42,353
- She was blatantly flirting with you.
- She was just being a kid.

503
00:31:42,394 --> 00:31:44,453
She wasn't flirting with me.

504
00:31:44,496 --> 00:31:47,397
They're highly sexualized.
Their hormones are raging.

505
00:31:47,433 --> 00:31:49,924
You don't think these kids
are having plenty of sex?

506
00:31:49,969 --> 00:31:51,493
- l don't know.
- Please.

507
00:31:51,537 --> 00:31:53,334
They're like fucking rabbits.

508
00:31:53,372 --> 00:31:55,932
These little teenage geeks
they're fucking,

509
00:31:55,975 --> 00:31:58,535
they do not know
how lucky they got it right now.

510
00:31:58,577 --> 00:32:00,704
One day they'll be old and paunchy

511
00:32:00,746 --> 00:32:03,977
and turning 50 and looking back
on how lucky they had it

512
00:32:04,016 --> 00:32:05,916
and didn't appreciate it.
Kind of like you.

513
00:32:05,951 --> 00:32:08,784
( audio rewinding )

514
00:32:08,821 --> 00:32:11,688
- Well, see you.
- See you later.

515
00:32:13,025 --> 00:32:14,458
My God, did you
see those nipples?

516
00:32:14,493 --> 00:32:17,519
Working on a little
project, are we?

517
00:32:17,563 --> 00:32:18,996
What do you mean?

518
00:32:19,031 --> 00:32:21,499
Please, Sherri,
l know you way too well.

519
00:32:21,533 --> 00:32:23,865
You want to fuck Mr. Krebbs.

520
00:32:23,902 --> 00:32:25,733
Perhaps.

521
00:32:25,771 --> 00:32:28,171
Sherri, you're crazy.

522
00:32:28,207 --> 00:32:29,902
What?
He's kind of cute.

523
00:32:29,942 --> 00:32:31,910
Yeah, and his wife's
about to have a baby.

524
00:32:31,944 --> 00:32:35,175
Exactly.
He probably hasn't had sex in months.

525
00:32:35,214 --> 00:32:37,182
He's probably horny as shit.

526
00:32:37,216 --> 00:32:39,207
Don't say anything to anyone.

527
00:32:40,452 --> 00:32:42,443
l won't.

528
00:32:42,488 --> 00:32:44,888
Are you even reading
''Marjorie Morning Glory,''

529
00:32:44,923 --> 00:32:46,550
or whatever the fuck it's called?

530
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,753
l read the back cover.

531
00:32:48,794 --> 00:32:50,284
Oh God.

532
00:32:50,329 --> 00:32:52,559
You are so pathetic.

533
00:33:08,314 --> 00:33:11,750
## Opening a can or worms ##

534
00:33:11,784 --> 00:33:15,948
## That are now out of date ##

535
00:33:15,988 --> 00:33:19,822
## No matter what you do ##

536
00:33:19,858 --> 00:33:23,988
## Don't you dare throw them away ##

537
00:33:24,029 --> 00:33:27,897
## A harlot spikes the bowl ##

538
00:33:27,933 --> 00:33:32,029
## With regurgitated brains ##

539
00:33:32,071 --> 00:33:35,768
## We hide under
a broken rainbow ##

540
00:33:35,808 --> 00:33:40,507
## Waiting for the rain to fade... ##

541
00:33:40,546 --> 00:33:42,605
## Hello, Megan ##

542
00:33:42,648 --> 00:33:44,445
## Hello, monkey ##

543
00:33:44,483 --> 00:33:46,474
## l love you, Megan ##

544
00:33:46,518 --> 00:33:48,645
## l love you, monkey. ##

545
00:33:55,427 --> 00:33:59,193
## Because déjà vu ##

546
00:33:59,231 --> 00:34:04,066
## lt sounds like something not true ##

547
00:34:04,103 --> 00:34:07,163
## But l think ##

548
00:34:07,206 --> 00:34:12,007
## That l have seen it with you ##

549
00:34:12,044 --> 00:34:15,172
## And l am sure ##

550
00:34:15,214 --> 00:34:19,878
## l've never been here before ##

551
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:23,354
## lt's there at my door ##

552
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:27,758
## That is running on the floor ##

553
00:34:27,793 --> 00:34:30,557
## High ##

554
00:34:30,596 --> 00:34:35,260
## Up at the shooting range ##

555
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:39,236
## Where the kids play ##

556
00:34:39,271 --> 00:34:43,173
## And there's bad blood ##

557
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:45,802
## We were high ##

558
00:34:46,812 --> 00:34:51,010
## And feeling no pain ##

559
00:34:51,049 --> 00:34:55,145
## Where the trash drains ##

560
00:34:55,187 --> 00:34:59,715
## ls where we will lie ##

561
00:34:59,758 --> 00:35:03,250
## Looking out the window ##

562
00:35:03,295 --> 00:35:07,925
## With a hot beer on the red-eye. ##

563
00:35:07,966 --> 00:35:10,400
Hey.

564
00:35:10,436 --> 00:35:12,267
- That was beautiful.
- Oh thanks, man.

565
00:35:12,304 --> 00:35:14,932
- Yeah, that's a good one, man.
- Thanks.

566
00:35:16,241 --> 00:35:17,731
$8.1 3.

567
00:35:18,744 --> 00:35:21,008
- Just keep it.
- All right.

568
00:35:21,046 --> 00:35:23,571
- Thank you so much.
- Sure, right on, man.

569
00:35:26,385 --> 00:35:28,250
- Bye,
- All right, thanks.

570
00:35:28,287 --> 00:35:30,050
- See you later.
- Bye.

571
00:35:32,758 --> 00:35:35,556
( chuckles )
That'll work.

572
00:35:36,628 --> 00:35:39,756
Hey, man, l need
to borrow some money.

573
00:35:39,798 --> 00:35:41,891
You still owe me
fucking money, man.

574
00:35:41,934 --> 00:35:44,869
l know. Look, l've got a ticket
that's gonna double

575
00:35:44,903 --> 00:35:46,734
tomorrow if l don't pay it.
Double.

576
00:35:46,772 --> 00:35:49,935
How'd you get a ticket, man?
You don't drive.

577
00:35:49,975 --> 00:35:51,567
Jaywalking.

578
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,271
Give me 50 bucks.

579
00:35:53,312 --> 00:35:56,804
$50? Give me a break, Carl,
l can't, man.

580
00:35:56,849 --> 00:35:59,875
Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

581
00:35:59,918 --> 00:36:03,115
Carl, l can't. How much do you think
l make in this fucking dump?

582
00:36:03,155 --> 00:36:06,682
All right? l'm already letting you
eat that bullshit for free, man.

583
00:36:06,725 --> 00:36:08,955
lf my boss found out
he'd fucking fire me.

584
00:36:08,994 --> 00:36:12,953
Just have your mom wire the fucking
money instead of sending a check.

585
00:36:22,007 --> 00:36:23,201
Hey.

586
00:36:24,443 --> 00:36:26,172
Hey.

587
00:36:26,211 --> 00:36:27,872
Uh-oh.

588
00:36:27,913 --> 00:36:30,006
Can we talk?

589
00:36:30,048 --> 00:36:32,073
l'm working.

590
00:36:32,117 --> 00:36:34,483
No, you know what?

591
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,078
l don't think that'd be
a good fucking idea.

592
00:36:36,121 --> 00:36:38,521
Please?
l miss you.

593
00:36:51,203 --> 00:36:52,534
What the fuck are you doing here?

594
00:36:52,571 --> 00:36:54,835
l just really miss you, okay?
l'm sorry.

595
00:36:54,873 --> 00:36:56,738
Are you fucking kidding me?

596
00:36:56,775 --> 00:36:58,538
What is this bullshit?

597
00:36:58,577 --> 00:37:00,272
No, l want to get back together.

598
00:37:03,015 --> 00:37:06,007
What-- what about
fucking Arnondo,

599
00:37:06,051 --> 00:37:08,076
or whatever
the fuck his name was?

600
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,587
l thought you guys
were going to Arizona.

601
00:37:09,621 --> 00:37:12,419
lt's Marco
and l came back.

602
00:37:13,425 --> 00:37:17,555
Can you imagine for one fucking
second if l came up to you

603
00:37:17,596 --> 00:37:20,565
and l said, ''Hey, by the way,
we're breaking up

604
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:23,625
'cause l just met this
really unbelievable girl.

605
00:37:23,669 --> 00:37:26,729
l never knew what love
was with you.

606
00:37:26,772 --> 00:37:29,138
We can still be friends.

607
00:37:29,174 --> 00:37:33,270
Oh, and you know, this girl is
an unbelievable flamenco dancer.

608
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:35,803
We're gonna put together
this fucking cabaret act

609
00:37:35,847 --> 00:37:38,714
and go out to Arizona and dance
at her uncle's restaurant.''

610
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,115
Am l forgetting
any fucking shit?

611
00:37:40,152 --> 00:37:42,052
Willie, stop it, okay?
l'm sorry.

612
00:37:42,087 --> 00:37:44,112
l made a mistake, okay?

613
00:37:44,156 --> 00:37:46,351
l made a horrible
horrible mistake.

614
00:37:46,391 --> 00:37:48,222
l'm only human.

615
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:50,319
Can we just--

616
00:37:52,764 --> 00:37:55,460
Look, this ain't the place for this shit,
all right? l'm working, okay?

617
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,559
Can we talk somewhere else, please?

618
00:38:01,273 --> 00:38:03,298
- Please?
- Wait a fucking minute.

619
00:38:06,078 --> 00:38:08,546
Watch the fucking store
for me for a minute, okay?

620
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:11,413
Don't do it, man.
That chick is bad news.

621
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:13,145
l just need 10 or 15 minutes.

622
00:38:13,185 --> 00:38:14,675
l'm gonna go next door
and have a cup of coffee.

623
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,745
Just watch the fucking place.

624
00:38:16,788 --> 00:38:18,517
And what if a customer comes in?

625
00:38:18,557 --> 00:38:20,422
lt's fucking dead at this hour, man.

626
00:38:20,459 --> 00:38:23,053
l don't know how
to work the register.

627
00:38:23,095 --> 00:38:26,258
There's nothing to fucking work.
lt's a computer with a laser.

628
00:38:27,633 --> 00:38:29,464
All right?

629
00:38:29,501 --> 00:38:31,594
Look, you see that?

630
00:38:31,637 --> 00:38:35,164
- That's a barcode.
- l know what a barcode is, dumbfuck.

631
00:38:35,207 --> 00:38:38,142
Well, all you do
is scan it with the laser,

632
00:38:38,176 --> 00:38:40,770
the price pops up, all right?

633
00:38:40,812 --> 00:38:43,781
lf they give you a five or a 10
or whatever they give you

634
00:38:43,815 --> 00:38:45,680
you just hit the number.
lt's written, $5.

635
00:38:45,717 --> 00:38:47,844
You hit it.
All you do is hit sale.

636
00:38:47,886 --> 00:38:49,979
And it's-- 806 is the code,
all right?

637
00:38:50,022 --> 00:38:52,820
Sale 806, it open--
it should open.

638
00:38:52,858 --> 00:38:55,383
Escape.
lf it doesn't open, hit escape.

639
00:38:55,427 --> 00:38:57,190
- ( beeping )
- All right?

640
00:38:57,229 --> 00:39:00,062
lt'll open.
lt should fucking open.

641
00:39:00,098 --> 00:39:02,532
Just hit escape,
okay, if it doesn't open.

642
00:39:02,567 --> 00:39:04,762
They designed it so a fucking
monkey could work it, man.

643
00:39:04,803 --> 00:39:06,134
lt's nothing.

644
00:39:06,171 --> 00:39:08,105
Don't be a sap, man.

645
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:11,940
Grow some fucking balls
and tell that chick to fuck off.

646
00:39:11,977 --> 00:39:14,138
Look, there's no way

647
00:39:14,179 --> 00:39:16,170
l'm taking this fucking bitch
back, man.

648
00:39:16,214 --> 00:39:19,081
Okay?
Just mind the store.

649
00:39:29,294 --> 00:39:31,285
( woman screaming )

650
00:39:31,329 --> 00:39:33,229
Let me out!
Let me out!

651
00:39:33,265 --> 00:39:35,165
( pounding )

652
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,532
( screaming continues )

653
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,832
Hey, what about her?

654
00:39:46,144 --> 00:39:47,941
Someone will find her.

655
00:39:47,979 --> 00:39:49,810
Let's get out of here.

656
00:40:12,204 --> 00:40:14,570
( truck starts )

657
00:40:55,147 --> 00:40:57,240
Oh, don't come in here.

658
00:40:57,282 --> 00:41:00,046
Please don't come in here.

659
00:41:08,093 --> 00:41:10,061
Oh, fuck.

660
00:41:31,483 --> 00:41:33,110
Hey.

661
00:41:36,922 --> 00:41:38,412
And a carton of Parliaments.

662
00:41:40,425 --> 00:41:43,360
Uh, okay.
Will that be all, sir?

663
00:41:45,597 --> 00:41:47,861
- Yeah.
- Okay.

664
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,763
All right, then.

665
00:41:50,802 --> 00:41:53,066
Let me just put this

666
00:41:53,104 --> 00:41:54,833
in a little baggie.

667
00:41:58,944 --> 00:42:01,071
The duct tape...

668
00:42:01,112 --> 00:42:03,307
carton of Parliaments.

669
00:42:03,348 --> 00:42:05,782
Okay, let's see.

670
00:42:05,817 --> 00:42:08,718
( beeping )

671
00:42:17,229 --> 00:42:20,255
- ( horn honking )
- Just a sec.

672
00:42:20,298 --> 00:42:22,391
( honks horn )

673
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:30,365
( horn honking )

674
00:42:30,408 --> 00:42:32,376
l'm growing a beard here, dude.

675
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:34,401
l know.
These things are confusing.

676
00:42:37,115 --> 00:42:39,413
Carl:
Ay-yi-yi.

677
00:42:39,451 --> 00:42:41,248
- Let's go.
- l got it.

678
00:42:41,286 --> 00:42:43,151
Believe me, l'd like to.

679
00:42:43,188 --> 00:42:44,985
This guy must be new or something.

680
00:42:45,023 --> 00:42:47,992
Sorry, these things are tricky.
Very confusing.

681
00:42:48,026 --> 00:42:49,721
Do you need a credit card?

682
00:42:49,761 --> 00:42:52,127
No no no, that would be worse.

683
00:42:52,163 --> 00:42:53,596
What's the problem?

684
00:42:53,632 --> 00:42:55,259
You know what?
Just take it.

685
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:57,063
Just take it.

686
00:42:57,102 --> 00:42:58,660
What?

687
00:42:58,703 --> 00:43:02,104
This register is for shit.
Just take it. Take it, take it.

688
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:04,074
No, man, no.
Look, here.

689
00:43:06,144 --> 00:43:09,341
Here's 40 bucks.
There's no way it's more than that.

690
00:43:10,749 --> 00:43:12,649
Keep the change, all right?

691
00:43:21,893 --> 00:43:24,157
What nice guys.

692
00:43:31,136 --> 00:43:33,195
( exhales )

693
00:43:42,514 --> 00:43:44,175
( door buzzes )

694
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:48,542
- God!
- Oh my God, Mr. Krebbs.

695
00:43:48,586 --> 00:43:50,486
Oh, man.

696
00:43:50,522 --> 00:43:53,082
Sherri, what are you doing here?

697
00:43:53,124 --> 00:43:56,252
My aunt lives here.
What are you doing here?

698
00:43:56,294 --> 00:43:58,125
Well, l live here.

699
00:43:58,163 --> 00:44:00,893
Wow, what a coincidence.

700
00:44:00,932 --> 00:44:03,526
Do you always get home
this late from school?

701
00:44:03,568 --> 00:44:05,968
Uh, no.
l'm chairman of the book fair.

702
00:44:06,004 --> 00:44:09,132
So a lot of organizing to do
these next few nights.

703
00:44:09,174 --> 00:44:11,369
How's Mrs. Krebbs?

704
00:44:11,409 --> 00:44:13,570
She's so beautiful, by the way.

705
00:44:13,611 --> 00:44:15,044
Thank you.
No, she's good.

706
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,707
She's good.
She's waiting for her pretzels.

707
00:44:16,748 --> 00:44:18,909
She's getting all those
cravings they talk about.

708
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:21,441
You know, last month and all.

709
00:44:21,486 --> 00:44:24,853
So, um...
Yeah, anyway, l'm gonna go up--

710
00:44:24,889 --> 00:44:27,414
Um, l would love to get together

711
00:44:27,459 --> 00:44:29,586

712
00:44:31,096 --> 00:44:32,620
Okay.

713
00:44:32,664 --> 00:44:34,689
Um...

714
00:44:34,733 --> 00:44:36,667
Okay, well, um...

715
00:44:36,701 --> 00:44:38,293

that in school, all right?

716
00:44:38,336 --> 00:44:40,201
And l'll see you tomorrow.

717
00:44:40,238 --> 00:44:42,536
Okay.

718
00:45:33,258 --> 00:45:34,953
Bad move, man.

719
00:45:34,993 --> 00:45:37,154
Shut up.
Any customers?

720
00:45:37,195 --> 00:45:38,526
Nope.

721
00:45:40,098 --> 00:45:41,588
( can rattles )

722
00:45:41,633 --> 00:45:43,601
What the fuck is shit shit, man?

723
00:45:43,635 --> 00:45:46,263
God damn, Carl.

724
00:45:46,304 --> 00:45:48,602
Fucking pig, man.

725
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,938
Get on the other side of the counter.

726
00:45:52,177 --> 00:45:54,168
Motherfucker.

727
00:45:54,212 --> 00:45:56,772
l can't believe you're such a pussy.

728
00:45:56,815 --> 00:45:59,648
Look who's fucking talking.

729
00:45:59,684 --> 00:46:03,415
You practically stalked Lucy
for the past five fucking years, man.

730
00:46:03,455 --> 00:46:05,389
No.

731
00:46:05,423 --> 00:46:06,981
We became friends.

732
00:46:07,025 --> 00:46:09,323
You're telling me that you
wouldn't go back with her?

733
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,827
No, l wouldn't.

734
00:46:10,862 --> 00:46:12,454
Well, would you fuck her?

735
00:46:12,497 --> 00:46:14,590
Yes, but that's different.

736
00:46:14,632 --> 00:46:16,497
Oh, different my fucking ass, man.

737
00:46:16,534 --> 00:46:19,765
Look, l ain't gonna play this whole
macho posturing bullshit.

738
00:46:19,804 --> 00:46:22,466
l can get past
the whole Arnondo thing.

739
00:46:22,507 --> 00:46:24,202
You know why?

740
00:46:24,242 --> 00:46:26,540
Because fucking love
is bigger than one little mistake.

741
00:46:27,879 --> 00:46:31,315
Marco.
His name is Marco.

742
00:46:31,349 --> 00:46:33,044
Whatever, man.
Fuck you.

743
00:46:33,084 --> 00:46:34,608
Olé!

744
00:46:34,652 --> 00:46:37,416
Olé olé olé.

745
00:46:38,156 --> 00:46:41,148
( woman screaming )
Help me!

746
00:46:41,226 --> 00:46:43,456

747
00:46:43,495 --> 00:46:45,395

748
00:47:00,345 --> 00:47:03,280
Man on P.A.:

749
00:47:04,883 --> 00:47:07,283
Tony Gilbert, extension 2-5.

750
00:47:08,853 --> 00:47:10,912
Tony, 2-5, please.

751
00:47:10,955 --> 00:47:13,116
This is Tony.

752
00:47:14,592 --> 00:47:17,083
Nope, in the back.

753
00:47:17,128 --> 00:47:19,028
Yeah.

754
00:47:19,063 --> 00:47:21,190
Well, what was the word
of the day, Michael?

755
00:47:21,232 --> 00:47:23,291
No no no, the word of the day
was initiative.

756
00:47:23,334 --> 00:47:25,029
Take some.
Find it yourself.

757
00:47:31,075 --> 00:47:33,100
Tell me when.

758
00:48:08,112 --> 00:48:09,807
Hey, sweetie,
you gonna play leapfrog

759
00:48:09,847 --> 00:48:11,781
with the ladybug and the frog?

760
00:48:11,816 --> 00:48:14,546
- All right.
- lt's hard.

761
00:48:14,586 --> 00:48:16,952
You can do it.
Jump back and forth and play leapfrog.

762
00:48:19,123 --> 00:48:21,114
All right.
Good job.

763
00:48:21,159 --> 00:48:23,252
That was good.

764
00:48:42,146 --> 00:48:43,807
Krebbs:
What, are you stalking me or what?

765
00:48:43,848 --> 00:48:47,306
- You would like that, wouldn't you?
- No, l would not.

766
00:48:47,352 --> 00:48:49,786
No, l like to come here on Sundays

767
00:48:49,821 --> 00:48:53,222
and have my iced coffee,
read the paper.

768
00:48:53,258 --> 00:48:55,726
Really?
l've never seen you here on a Sunday,

769
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,729
lt's my new tradition.

770
00:48:58,763 --> 00:49:00,890
What are you writing?

771
00:49:00,932 --> 00:49:02,866
l am writing a screenplay.

772
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:04,800
- Wow.
- Yeah.

773
00:49:04,836 --> 00:49:06,929
l didn't know you wrote screenplays.

774
00:49:06,971 --> 00:49:08,461
You wouldn't.
Nobody knows.

775
00:49:08,506 --> 00:49:11,873
l write them and nobody buys them,
so why would you know?

776
00:49:11,909 --> 00:49:15,208
Um, so what's it about?

777
00:49:15,246 --> 00:49:19,012
Uh, it's a supernatural
political thriller.

778
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:21,143
Wow.

779
00:49:21,185 --> 00:49:23,210
- Okay, tell me.
- Yeah?

780
00:49:23,254 --> 00:49:25,313
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.

781
00:49:25,356 --> 00:49:27,654
( audio fast forwarding )

782
00:49:31,429 --> 00:49:34,489
Wow, that sounds complicated.

783
00:49:34,532 --> 00:49:36,500
lt does, doesn't it?

784
00:49:36,534 --> 00:49:38,559
Yeah, it takes
a little bit of research,

785
00:49:38,603 --> 00:49:40,571
but l like the political stuff.

786
00:49:40,605 --> 00:49:43,199
Oh, me too.

787
00:49:43,241 --> 00:49:45,209

789
00:49:48,112 --> 00:49:50,342
Oh boy.

00:50:10,535 --> 00:50:12,867
l want a hot dog.
l want a hot dog.

791
00:50:12,904 --> 00:50:15,338
- l want a hot dog.
- No.

792
00:50:15,373 --> 00:50:18,035
No hot dogs.
We eat healthy in this family.

793
00:50:18,076 --> 00:50:20,010
All right, who wants what?

794
00:50:20,044 --> 00:50:22,103
- l want a hot dog.
- No.

795
00:50:22,146 --> 00:50:24,046
Let her have a hot dog.
lt's Sunday.

796
00:50:24,082 --> 00:50:25,709

- Fine. Fine.

798
00:50:29,387 --> 00:50:32,982
God, all right. l'll have

799
00:50:33,024 --> 00:50:34,582
- All right.
- Are you happy now?

800
00:50:34,625 --> 00:50:37,526
- One hotdog for you.
- Plain with catsup too.

801
00:50:37,562 --> 00:50:38,620
With catsup.
One for me.

802
00:50:39,597 --> 00:50:41,622
A chicken Caesar
and an iced tea for Mommy,

803
00:50:41,666 --> 00:50:44,362
And one barbequed beef
sandwich for him.

804
00:50:44,402 --> 00:50:46,700
- Be right back.
- How can he eat that?

805
00:50:46,738 --> 00:50:50,299
- Ben.
- George, what are you doing here?

806
00:50:50,341 --> 00:50:53,037

807
00:50:53,077 --> 00:50:55,307

00:50:59,283 --> 00:51:00,443
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

811
00:51:00,485 --> 00:51:02,385
And that little larval human
over there is Josh.

812
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:04,945
You have a cute little family here.

813
00:51:04,989 --> 00:51:06,547
Thank you.

814
00:51:06,591 --> 00:51:08,786
Well, l'll let you get back to
doing what you were doing.

815
00:51:08,826 --> 00:51:11,386
So see you around the campus?

816
00:51:11,429 --> 00:51:13,590
- All right, take care, George.

817
00:51:13,631 --> 00:51:15,155
- Take care.
- Bye.

818
00:51:16,634 --> 00:51:19,603
- How do you know him?
- l see him around the courthouse.

819
00:51:19,637 --> 00:51:21,935
He works for one of those
civil liberties groups.

820
00:51:21,973 --> 00:51:24,942
Mommy,
since l'm having vegetables

821
00:51:24,976 --> 00:51:27,467
can't l have some ice cream?

822
00:51:27,512 --> 00:51:29,412
l don't think so.

823
00:51:29,447 --> 00:51:32,541
You know what?
He seems a little G-A-Y to me.

824
00:51:32,583 --> 00:51:34,312
- You think?
- Yeah.

825
00:51:34,352 --> 00:51:36,252
- All right, l'll be right back.
- Just kidding.

826
00:51:36,287 --> 00:51:38,653
- You are so cute.
- l'm not even having vegetables.

827
00:51:40,057 --> 00:51:41,922
Be right back.

828
00:51:42,994 --> 00:51:45,189
Well, let's see
if you eat all your dinner.

829
00:51:45,229 --> 00:51:47,925
And if you do, we'll think about ice cream.
How about that?

830
00:51:47,965 --> 00:51:49,262
Okay.

831
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,131
So where is Mrs. Krebbs?

832
00:51:51,169 --> 00:51:53,262
She's asleep.
She's taking a nap.

833
00:51:54,839 --> 00:51:56,329
You guys are a cute couple.

834
00:51:56,374 --> 00:51:58,808
How long have you been together?

835
00:51:58,843 --> 00:52:02,301
Been together seven years.
Been married for two.

836
00:52:02,346 --> 00:52:04,246
Wow.

837
00:52:04,282 --> 00:52:06,614
- Seven years?
- Seven years.

838
00:52:06,651 --> 00:52:09,950
That's a long time to only have sex
with one person.

839
00:52:11,355 --> 00:52:13,585
Excuse me?

840
00:52:13,624 --> 00:52:15,990
l'm sorry, Mr. Krebbs.

841
00:52:16,027 --> 00:52:18,655
l'm just saying that seven years
with no variety...

842
00:52:18,696 --> 00:52:21,688
l mean, l know how guys are.

843
00:52:21,732 --> 00:52:23,324
l assure you l'm not a guy, okay?

844
00:52:23,367 --> 00:52:24,925
l'm-- l'm your teacher.

845
00:52:24,969 --> 00:52:27,836
l know you're my teacher.

846
00:52:27,872 --> 00:52:30,466
But last time l--

847
00:52:30,508 --> 00:52:32,999
- l checked...
- Mm-hmm.

848
00:52:33,044 --> 00:52:36,741
You're a guy too.
A very cute guy, l might add.

849
00:52:36,781 --> 00:52:38,942
Thank you.
Thank you for the compliment.

850
00:52:38,983 --> 00:52:40,780
l really appreciate that,
but l think...

851
00:52:40,818 --> 00:52:43,412
l'm gonna go on that note.
Okey-doke?

852
00:52:43,454 --> 00:52:46,287
So why don't we just
leave it there, okay?

853
00:52:46,324 --> 00:52:49,191
l've got all my stuff.
Thank you.

854
00:52:49,227 --> 00:52:50,888
- l'll see--
- Um...

855
00:52:50,928 --> 00:52:53,362
You can't blame a girl for trying.

856
00:52:55,333 --> 00:52:57,392
See you in class.

857
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:01,604
Woman:
There is somebody that works here

858
00:53:01,639 --> 00:53:03,834
who l thought maybe
l'd have a future with.

859
00:53:03,875 --> 00:53:06,742
Ooh, do tell.

860
00:53:06,777 --> 00:53:08,574
Wait, is it that cute kid in shipping?

861
00:53:08,613 --> 00:53:10,808
What's his name?
Doug?

862
00:53:10,848 --> 00:53:12,543
No.

863
00:53:12,583 --> 00:53:14,107
He's a manager.

864
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,620
Really?

865
00:53:17,655 --> 00:53:19,486
Who is it?

866
00:53:20,525 --> 00:53:24,017
lf l tell you you have to swear
not to tell a soul.

867
00:53:24,061 --> 00:53:27,030
He swore me to secrecy
and said we'd both get fired.

868
00:53:27,064 --> 00:53:28,827
Scout's honor.

869
00:53:28,866 --> 00:53:30,857
Okay.

870
00:53:30,902 --> 00:53:33,996
lt's Tony Gilbert.
Do you know him?

871
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:45,140
Marian, will you call the New York
stores, see if they have her size?

872
00:53:45,182 --> 00:53:47,912
Hey, Tony, can l see you in the storeroom
about that inventory problem?

873
00:53:47,952 --> 00:53:49,681
Oh, that's right.
Yeah.

874
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:51,984
- Marian, you got this covered?
- Yes.

875
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,287
Come here.
l was so horny l was--

876
00:53:58,329 --> 00:54:00,627
Ow!
What the hell was that for?

877
00:54:00,665 --> 00:54:03,532
- For Naomi, you asshole.
- Who's Naomi?

878
00:54:03,568 --> 00:54:06,059
You creep!
You don't even know who you sleep with.

879
00:54:06,103 --> 00:54:08,162
The part-time girl in junior wear.

880
00:54:08,205 --> 00:54:10,298
Oh, ''Niomi.''

881
00:54:10,341 --> 00:54:12,366
What are you jealous about?

882
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:13,809
No, l'm not jealous.
l'm angry.

883
00:54:13,844 --> 00:54:15,778
How many other girls are you
boinking in dark corners?

884
00:54:15,813 --> 00:54:19,305
None, l swear.
lt was a one-time thing.

885
00:54:21,452 --> 00:54:22,851
Why am l even lying to you?

886
00:54:22,887 --> 00:54:24,821
Yeah, l screw around with
some of the girls, big deal.

887
00:54:24,855 --> 00:54:27,585
- You're married with three kids.
- That's besides the point.

888
00:54:27,625 --> 00:54:29,183
What, are you gonna
leave your husband for me?

889
00:54:29,226 --> 00:54:30,659
- No, but--
- Lydia, let's be honest here.

890
00:54:30,695 --> 00:54:32,663
We're both adults
having a little fun, right?

891
00:54:32,697 --> 00:54:35,598
l mean, l'm having fun.
l hope you're having fun.

892
00:54:36,601 --> 00:54:39,900
Frankly, you're more fun
than any of them.

893
00:54:39,937 --> 00:54:42,064
Oh, don't start doing
that thing with me.

894
00:54:42,106 --> 00:54:43,664
- What thing?
- That Tony thing.

895
00:54:43,708 --> 00:54:46,939
l'm not doing a Tony thing.
l'm being straight with you.

896
00:54:46,978 --> 00:54:49,845
Look, l don't drink, l don't smoke
and l don't do drugs.

897
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:52,940
But everyone's got to have a vice.
So my vice is pretty girls.

898
00:54:52,984 --> 00:54:55,851
But frankly, you know,

899
00:54:55,886 --> 00:54:57,877
you're different
than the other ones.

900
00:54:57,922 --> 00:54:59,890
- Oh, please.
- No, l swear to God, you're sexier.

901
00:54:59,924 --> 00:55:02,825
There's something-- like Naomi,
she's just like a girl.

902
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:05,260
But there's something about you--
you're like a woman.

903
00:55:07,665 --> 00:55:09,929
For instance,
like, look at those boobs.

904
00:55:09,967 --> 00:55:12,731
l'm getting turned on just standing
here arguing with you.

905
00:55:12,770 --> 00:55:14,635
- You know what l'm saying?
- You're always turned on.

906
00:55:14,672 --> 00:55:16,640
You're a walking hard-on.

907
00:55:16,674 --> 00:55:18,403
Just feel that.
You feel that?

908
00:55:18,442 --> 00:55:20,307
Okay...

909
00:55:20,344 --> 00:55:22,312
Tony, stop.

910
00:55:22,346 --> 00:55:24,371
- l'm supposed to be mad at you.
- Good, be mad.

911
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:27,680
Angry sex is good sex.
l'll get angry too.

912
00:55:27,718 --> 00:55:30,152
l'll think about social injustice

913
00:55:30,187 --> 00:55:33,452
and how the Cubs can't win.

914
00:55:33,491 --> 00:55:35,254
- ( laughs )
- And the rainforest.

915
00:55:35,292 --> 00:55:37,658
You know, you are out of your mind.

916
00:55:37,695 --> 00:55:39,458
Come here, help me off
with these pants.

917
00:55:46,537 --> 00:55:48,835
( giggles )

918
00:56:51,335 --> 00:56:53,530
Let's go. Daddy's probably
waiting for us by now.

919
00:56:53,571 --> 00:56:56,165
- l want this kitty.
- Next time, sweetheart.

920
00:56:56,207 --> 00:56:58,835
- Please.
- You have enough of them.

921
00:56:58,876 --> 00:57:01,606
- Some other time.
- Mom, l need it.

922
00:57:39,817 --> 00:57:41,910
Hey, buddy.
Sorry to keep you waiting.

923
00:57:41,952 --> 00:57:44,011
My deposition ran long.

924
00:57:44,054 --> 00:57:45,612
No problem.

925
00:57:45,656 --> 00:57:49,786
And thank you for playing it cool
at the mall.

926
00:57:49,827 --> 00:57:51,692
Of course.

927
00:57:51,729 --> 00:57:53,993
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

928
00:57:54,031 --> 00:57:55,760
l know what l want.
You know what you want?

929
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:58,268
- Kobe burger--
- ( audio fast forwarding )

930
00:58:01,739 --> 00:58:03,172
l can't do this anymore.

931
00:58:04,675 --> 00:58:07,508
This is out of the blue.
Why?

932
00:58:07,545 --> 00:58:09,706
Out of the blue?

933
00:58:10,714 --> 00:58:13,649
l saw you with your family, man.

934
00:58:13,684 --> 00:58:16,482
l saw how happy you were.
They're beautiful.

935
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:19,512
You're never gonna leave them
and l don't expect you to.

936
00:58:22,026 --> 00:58:26,190
Look, l didn't expect to have these
feelings for you, but l do.

937
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:29,165
lt hit me--
l need someone for me.

938
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,327
l'm not gonna share you.

939
00:58:31,368 --> 00:58:33,996
l can't do this anymore.

940
00:58:38,242 --> 00:58:40,938
Well, that's all well and good
and l understand that

941
00:58:40,978 --> 00:58:43,538
but we just don't cover acts of God

942
00:58:43,581 --> 00:58:46,345
in our insurance policy.

943
00:58:46,383 --> 00:58:49,181
lf you actually reread your
homeowner's contract,

944
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:51,154
and l can actually read to you

945
00:58:51,188 --> 00:58:53,418
from our manual and handbook--

946
00:59:00,164 --> 00:59:02,223
l'm sorry.

947
00:59:02,266 --> 00:59:03,733
Can l call you back?

948
00:59:05,936 --> 00:59:07,904
lt's really funny every time.

949
00:59:07,938 --> 00:59:10,498
Sour cream in my desk drawer--

950
00:59:10,541 --> 00:59:12,634
that's just brilliant.
That's hilarious.

951
00:59:12,676 --> 00:59:14,769
Sour cre--
who would do a thing like that?

952
00:59:14,812 --> 00:59:16,973
That is a perfectly
good waste of sour cream.

953
00:59:17,014 --> 00:59:20,177
You know, l get it.
l'm the joke around here, okay?

954
00:59:20,217 --> 00:59:23,152
Everybody loves to pick on me.
l'm the nerd, okay?

955
00:59:23,187 --> 00:59:25,747
Let's mess with Marty's car.

956
00:59:25,789 --> 00:59:28,917
Let's lock him in
that locker all weekend.

957
00:59:28,959 --> 00:59:32,360
Let's pull his pants down
in the middle of gym class.

958
00:59:33,564 --> 00:59:36,499
Congratulations, Stuart.
You win, okay?

959
00:59:36,533 --> 00:59:38,524
You know, out of all the people

960
00:59:38,569 --> 00:59:41,629
that have humiliated me
and bullied me

961
00:59:41,672 --> 00:59:43,196
you win, okay?

962
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:46,175
Because your pranks
are the most creative

963
00:59:46,210 --> 00:59:48,201
and the most outrageous

964
00:59:48,245 --> 00:59:52,204
and the most-- the most hilarious
for everybody, okay?

965
00:59:52,249 --> 00:59:55,548
So l hope you
are proud of yourself.

966
00:59:55,586 --> 00:59:57,486
Jerk!

967
01:00:00,691 --> 01:00:02,386
- Nice job.
- Yeah.

968
01:00:02,426 --> 01:00:04,291
- That brought up some issues.
- ( both laugh )

969
01:00:31,288 --> 01:00:33,620
Working late
on the book fair again?

970
01:00:33,657 --> 01:00:35,887
Sherri.

971
01:00:35,926 --> 01:00:37,951
Barry.

972
01:00:37,995 --> 01:00:40,088
Mr. Krebbs.

973
01:00:40,130 --> 01:00:43,566
ls that what you want me to
call you when you're fucking me?

974
01:00:45,436 --> 01:00:47,165
l think you should
go home now, Sherri.

975
01:00:48,772 --> 01:00:51,366
l don't suppose you
could give me a ride.

976
01:00:54,078 --> 01:00:55,705
lsn't that your car right there?

977
01:00:58,615 --> 01:01:00,606
lt won't start.

978
01:01:17,768 --> 01:01:19,531
Get in.

979
01:01:48,232 --> 01:01:50,223
( whispering )

980
01:02:00,744 --> 01:02:05,181
My, what a big cock you have,
Mr. Krebbs.

981
01:02:25,969 --> 01:02:28,733
( moaning )

982
01:03:24,328 --> 01:03:26,956
Sherri:
l'll see you in class.

983
01:03:50,154 --> 01:03:52,452
Holly?

984
01:03:52,489 --> 01:03:55,754
l just fucked Mr. Krebbs.

985
01:03:55,792 --> 01:03:57,987
ln the school parking lot.

986
01:03:58,028 --> 01:04:01,122
Meet me at Denny's immediately.

987
01:04:01,165 --> 01:04:03,827
( breathing heavily )

988
01:04:45,075 --> 01:04:47,305
( sniffs )

989
01:05:03,327 --> 01:05:04,954
( coughs )

990
01:05:05,963 --> 01:05:08,488
Hey-o, l'm back.

991
01:05:08,532 --> 01:05:11,558
l'm sorry, l checked the whole storeroom
and we are completely out.

992
01:05:11,602 --> 01:05:13,536
- l'm sorry.
- Sorry about that.

993
01:05:13,570 --> 01:05:15,367
We can order some.

994
01:05:15,405 --> 01:05:17,305
Go on the internet,
get some online maybe.

995
01:05:17,341 --> 01:05:19,138
No, that's okay.
Thank you.

996
01:05:19,176 --> 01:05:22,236
No problem. lf you need help with anything
else, you know where to find us.

997
01:05:22,279 --> 01:05:23,871
- Okay, great.
- Okay.

998
01:05:26,216 --> 01:05:28,810
Courtney, you are doing
a fantastic job, by the way.

999
01:05:28,852 --> 01:05:31,286
l mean really great. Are you sure
you haven't worked retail before?

1000
01:05:31,321 --> 01:05:34,757
l suppose l do if you count selling
doughnuts in high school.

1001
01:05:34,791 --> 01:05:37,487
l absolutely count selling doughnuts.

1002
01:05:37,527 --> 01:05:40,428
You just have a great way
with the customers, you know?

1003
01:05:40,464 --> 01:05:42,830
They really like you.

1004
01:05:42,866 --> 01:05:44,197
Thanks.

1005
01:05:48,839 --> 01:05:51,399
lt's easy to see why.

1006
01:05:51,441 --> 01:05:53,102
Thanks.

1007
01:05:54,811 --> 01:05:56,904
Want to see my balls?

1008
01:05:59,683 --> 01:06:01,674
Here they are.
Bath balls.

1009
01:06:01,718 --> 01:06:03,345
You know, you put them in the bathtub
and they fizz

1010
01:06:03,387 --> 01:06:05,287
and release oils and perfumes.

1011
01:06:05,322 --> 01:06:07,256
You always smell really nice,
by the way.

1012
01:06:07,291 --> 01:06:09,191
Do you take a lot of baths?

1013
01:06:09,226 --> 01:06:11,956
l know perfectly well
what bath bombs are.

1014
01:06:11,995 --> 01:06:14,020
Mr. Gilbert--

1015
01:06:14,064 --> 01:06:16,555
- Tony.
- Mr. Gilbert.

1016
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:19,694
l'd appreciate it if you'd keep your hands
and your innuendoes to yourself.

1017
01:06:19,736 --> 01:06:22,728
Come on, don't be such
a stick-in-the-mud.

1018
01:06:22,773 --> 01:06:25,264
l'm just a touchy-feely
kind of guy, you know?

1019
01:06:25,309 --> 01:06:27,368
And besides, there hasn't
been a girl this pretty

1020
01:06:27,411 --> 01:06:30,380
who's worked here in, like, ever.

1021
01:06:30,414 --> 01:06:33,815
Sometimes Little Tony takes over before
Big Tony knows what's going on.

1022
01:06:33,850 --> 01:06:36,011
Do you have, like,
any tattoos or anything?

1023
01:06:36,053 --> 01:06:38,214
Well, tell Little Tony
l think he should know

1024
01:06:38,255 --> 01:06:41,122
l had to sue my previous employer
for sexual harassment.

1025
01:06:41,158 --> 01:06:43,149
lt was a long drawn out process,

1026
01:06:43,193 --> 01:06:45,661
that was really embarrassing
for all of us.

1027
01:06:45,696 --> 01:06:48,631
l'd hate to put myself or anyone else
through that again.

1028
01:06:48,665 --> 01:06:50,690
Really?

1029
01:06:50,734 --> 01:06:52,463
Really.

1030
01:06:53,603 --> 01:06:55,798
Well, uh, Courtney,

1031
01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:57,773
if l crossed
any line, l apologize.

1032
01:06:57,808 --> 01:06:59,537
Just trying to be friendly.

1033
01:06:59,576 --> 01:07:01,203
Well, l'm not here to make friends.

1034
01:07:01,244 --> 01:07:03,007
l'm just here to do my job.

1035
01:07:03,046 --> 01:07:06,311
So if you'll excuse me,
l'm gonna go help some customers.

1036
01:07:20,197 --> 01:07:21,858
Barry.

1037
01:07:21,932 --> 01:07:24,025
- Hey, Dennis.
- Hey, wait up.

1038
01:07:24,067 --> 01:07:26,092
l've been looking for you.

1039
01:07:26,136 --> 01:07:29,162
Come here.
l've got to talk to you.

1040
01:07:29,206 --> 01:07:30,901
What's up?

1041
01:07:30,941 --> 01:07:33,432
You fuck Sherri Van Hafton?

1042
01:07:33,477 --> 01:07:35,342
What?

1043
01:07:36,947 --> 01:07:39,108
lt's a pretty simple question.
Did you fuck Sherri Van Hafton?

1044
01:07:41,017 --> 01:07:42,712
No, absolutely not.

1045
01:07:42,753 --> 01:07:44,584
Why?

1046
01:07:44,621 --> 01:07:47,249
Look, l'm not saying
l'd blame you if you did.

1047
01:07:47,290 --> 01:07:50,851
l'd give my left nut to get some
of that stink on my pinkie,

1048
01:07:50,894 --> 01:07:53,590
but kids are talking

1049
01:07:53,630 --> 01:07:56,224
and word is that you did.

1050
01:07:58,402 --> 01:08:00,370
All right, well, l didn't, okay?

1051
01:08:00,404 --> 01:08:02,338
Barry.

1052
01:08:03,774 --> 01:08:05,401
lt's me.
Just be honest.

1053
01:08:05,442 --> 01:08:07,307
l don't care.
l'm just curious.

1054
01:08:09,646 --> 01:08:11,944
( laughs )
lt's true, isn't it?

1055
01:08:11,982 --> 01:08:15,474
No, it's 100% not true.

1056
01:08:15,519 --> 01:08:17,043
Okay?

1057
01:08:17,087 --> 01:08:19,282
Well, if it's not true,
that's too bad.

1058
01:08:19,322 --> 01:08:21,153
l was gonna ask you
if l could smell your fingers.

1059
01:08:21,191 --> 01:08:23,056
( chuckles )

1060
01:08:23,093 --> 01:08:24,754
But if it is true--

1061
01:08:24,795 --> 01:08:26,922
l'm just saying if--

1062
01:08:26,963 --> 01:08:29,864
lie about it.
Lie about it no matter what she says.

1063
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:33,233
l mean, ultimately it's just
her word against yours.

1064
01:08:33,270 --> 01:08:35,795
( silent )

1065
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:52,120
Fucking asshole.

1066
01:08:55,058 --> 01:08:57,925
Megan:
Norman threw up on the slide today

1067
01:08:57,961 --> 01:09:00,521
and it went all the way down.

1068
01:09:00,564 --> 01:09:02,429
He did? Ew.

1069
01:09:02,466 --> 01:09:04,491
And then Buddy Miller...

1070
01:09:12,943 --> 01:09:15,207
Mom, what are we
gonna do after this?

1071
01:09:15,245 --> 01:09:19,238
After-- well, l have to buy my dress
for tomorrow night.

1072
01:09:19,282 --> 01:09:21,045
Can you buy me a dress too?

1073
01:09:21,084 --> 01:09:23,279
We'll see.

1074
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:25,948
Maybe-- well, l do need
to get a dress for you

1075
01:09:25,989 --> 01:09:28,822
for Carrie's birthday party.

1076
01:09:28,859 --> 01:09:32,295
Can it not have a bow on it?

1077
01:09:32,329 --> 01:09:34,661
No, it doesn't have
to have a bow on it.

1078
01:09:34,698 --> 01:09:36,461
You should have seen his face.

1079
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:38,695
What did you say?
What did you say?

1080
01:09:38,735 --> 01:09:40,134
Exactly what you told me to say.

1081
01:09:40,170 --> 01:09:42,365
Oh my God,
He must have totally freaked out.

1082
01:09:42,405 --> 01:09:44,498
What l would have given to
have been a fly on the wall.

1083
01:09:44,541 --> 01:09:46,008
You were so right.

1084
01:09:46,042 --> 01:09:48,408
First of all, the second
we were alone he started.

1085
01:09:48,445 --> 01:09:50,140
And just shameless.

1086
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:52,410
See, l told you. The second you
got hired l knew you'd be next.

1087
01:09:52,449 --> 01:09:54,508
When he tried that
Casanova shit on me

1088
01:09:54,551 --> 01:09:56,018
l told him, ''You touch me again,

1089
01:09:56,052 --> 01:09:58,486
l'm gonna sic my 300-lb husband
on your bony ass.''

1090
01:09:58,522 --> 01:10:00,183
And what does
Little Tony think of that?

1091
01:10:00,223 --> 01:10:01,656
( laughs )

1092
01:10:01,691 --> 01:10:04,421
Do you think any girls here
have actually slept with him?

1093
01:10:04,461 --> 01:10:06,019
Oh, l don't know.

1094
01:10:06,062 --> 01:10:08,496
Only the stupid ones,
l would think.

1095
01:10:08,532 --> 01:10:11,262
Well, nice work, sister.

1096
01:10:26,316 --> 01:10:28,910
Mr. Krebbs, can l see you
for a minute please?

1097
01:10:28,952 --> 01:10:30,613
Krebbs:
Yeah, sure.

1098
01:10:30,654 --> 01:10:33,646
Guys, just start the next chapter
in the book, okay, please?

1099
01:10:33,690 --> 01:10:35,954
Thank you.
What's going on?

1100
01:10:35,992 --> 01:10:38,552
What happened?
ls my wife okay?

1101
01:10:38,595 --> 01:10:40,460
- Barry Krebbs?
- Yeah?

1102
01:10:40,497 --> 01:10:43,193
You're under arrest for sexual assault
and rape of a minor.

1103
01:10:43,233 --> 01:10:44,928
What? Rape?

1104
01:10:44,968 --> 01:10:46,663
l didn't rape--
what are you talking about?

1105
01:10:46,703 --> 01:10:48,637
- l didn't rape-- this is a mistake.
- Barry, just--

1106
01:10:48,672 --> 01:10:50,970
- Bill, l didn't rape anyone.
- Barry, just do what they say.

1107
01:10:51,007 --> 01:10:53,475
You have the right to remain silent.
lf you refuse that right,

1108
01:10:53,510 --> 01:10:56,240
anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

1109
01:10:56,279 --> 01:10:57,837
You have the right to an attorney.

1110
01:10:57,881 --> 01:10:59,872
lf you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be provided to you.

1111
01:11:01,384 --> 01:11:03,944
Do you understand these rights
as l've explained them to you?

1112
01:11:03,987 --> 01:11:05,887
Yes.

1113
01:12:38,882 --> 01:12:42,443
Sir, there was a Middle-Eastern
guy onboard before.

1114
01:12:42,485 --> 01:12:45,283
l didn't see him get off,
but he left his knapsack on here

1115
01:12:45,321 --> 01:12:47,118
and it looks kind of suspicious.

1116
01:12:55,765 --> 01:12:57,630
Driver:
Get off the bus now.

1117
01:12:59,035 --> 01:13:01,560
Now, go go go.
Off the bus.

1118
01:13:01,604 --> 01:13:04,368
Step away from the bus.

1119
01:13:04,407 --> 01:13:05,806
Step away from the bus now.

1120
01:13:05,875 --> 01:13:09,504
He had always been really nice
to all the kids at school.

1121
01:13:09,579 --> 01:13:12,139
Always helped us with our problems.

1122
01:13:12,182 --> 01:13:15,549
So when he asked me to stay after
school and help with the book fair

1123
01:13:15,585 --> 01:13:19,419
l was happy to help.

1124
01:13:21,091 --> 01:13:23,355
But when we got to his car...

1125
01:13:24,627 --> 01:13:26,891
that's when it happened.

1126
01:13:26,930 --> 01:13:29,160
He just came up behind me

1127
01:13:29,199 --> 01:13:31,861
and pushed himself against me.

1128
01:13:31,901 --> 01:13:34,392
Woman:
Does she have to relive every detail?

1129
01:13:34,437 --> 01:13:36,405
Ma'am, please.

1130
01:13:36,439 --> 01:13:39,306
And then he started saying
how sexy l was

1131
01:13:39,342 --> 01:13:41,367
and how he wanted...

1132
01:13:43,313 --> 01:13:45,679
to F me.

1133
01:13:45,715 --> 01:13:48,912
l told Mr. Krebbs how
inappropriate this was

1134
01:13:48,952 --> 01:13:51,853
and that l was a virgin.

1135
01:13:54,190 --> 01:13:57,455
And then he just got
this wild look in his eyes

1136
01:13:57,494 --> 01:14:00,054
and he told me
how bad l wanted it

1137
01:14:00,096 --> 01:14:01,757
and just shoved me in the car.

1138
01:14:01,798 --> 01:14:04,596
He pulled out his...

1139
01:14:04,634 --> 01:14:07,398
- you know.
- His penis?

1140
01:14:07,437 --> 01:14:09,098
Yes.

1141
01:14:09,139 --> 01:14:11,767
And he shoved it in my mouth.

1142
01:14:11,808 --> 01:14:13,207
Woman:
Oh my God.

1143
01:14:13,243 --> 01:14:15,211
l'm sorry, Daddy.
l tried to get out.

1144
01:14:15,245 --> 01:14:17,236
He just kept pulling me back in.

1145
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:19,373
You have nothing to be
sorry for, sweetheart.

1146
01:14:19,415 --> 01:14:21,975
He pulled down my underpants...

1147
01:14:23,052 --> 01:14:26,453
and he shoved himself inside of me.

1148
01:14:27,590 --> 01:14:31,117
And l just kept saying no.

1149
01:14:31,161 --> 01:14:33,891
No no.

1150
01:14:36,299 --> 01:14:39,735
But he just kept going.

1151
01:14:44,974 --> 01:14:48,341
And then he told me if l ever
told anybody about this

1152
01:14:48,378 --> 01:14:50,778
he would kill me.

1153
01:14:52,715 --> 01:14:54,876
Then he threw me out of the car

1154
01:14:54,918 --> 01:14:57,216
and drove away.

1155
01:15:02,625 --> 01:15:04,388
Right, okay.

1156
01:15:06,429 --> 01:15:08,294
And these events,

1157
01:15:08,331 --> 01:15:11,391
they happened exactly as you
described them right here?

1158
01:15:11,434 --> 01:15:13,868
Yes.

1159
01:15:24,848 --> 01:15:26,577
Don't.

1160
01:15:32,021 --> 01:15:33,818
lt's all a huge lie.

1161
01:15:33,857 --> 01:15:36,155
lt's just--

1162
01:15:36,192 --> 01:15:38,956
teenagers are crazy.
They're emotional unstable.

1163
01:15:40,530 --> 01:15:42,088
l mean, it's--

1164
01:15:42,131 --> 01:15:44,725
it's just some little bitch
trying to get back at me

1165
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:46,394
for flunking her on a test.

1166
01:15:46,436 --> 01:15:48,336
She made the whole thing up.

1167
01:15:48,371 --> 01:15:50,635
l mean--

1168
01:15:50,673 --> 01:15:53,107
come on, you know l would
never do anything like that.

1169
01:15:56,446 --> 01:15:58,505
Are you aware that...

1170
01:16:00,283 --> 01:16:02,979
that rape is a very serious charge?

1171
01:16:03,019 --> 01:16:06,147
Of course she's aware that rape
is a very serious charge.

1172
01:16:06,189 --> 01:16:07,588
What the hell kind
of question is that?

1173
01:16:07,624 --> 01:16:08,989
Miss Van Hafton,
are you also aware

1174
01:16:09,025 --> 01:16:12,859
that your school is equipped
with a very comprehensive

1175
01:16:12,896 --> 01:16:15,228
system of surveillance cameras?

1176
01:16:18,301 --> 01:16:19,734
l'm sorry, what?

1177
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:33,212
You're such an idiot.

1178
01:16:33,249 --> 01:16:35,308
What?

1179
01:16:36,986 --> 01:16:40,547
They have you on tape, Barry.

1180
01:16:40,590 --> 01:16:42,751
What?

1181
01:16:42,792 --> 01:16:44,657
They have you

1182
01:16:44,694 --> 01:16:47,162
on tape

1183
01:16:47,196 --> 01:16:50,859
fucking a 16-year-old girl

1184
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:53,334
right in the high school parking lot.

1185
01:16:59,342 --> 01:17:00,969
( sobs )

1186
01:17:01,010 --> 01:17:03,274
What kind of moron are you?

1187
01:17:03,313 --> 01:17:06,009
How many other teenyboppers
have you fucked?

1188
01:17:06,049 --> 01:17:08,279
None! None!
Never! Never!

1189
01:17:11,087 --> 01:17:13,885
l-- who told you
that there was tape?

1190
01:17:15,491 --> 01:17:17,584
The police.

1191
01:17:19,195 --> 01:17:21,857
ln our car, Barry?

1192
01:17:23,399 --> 01:17:25,833
The car my father paid for?

1193
01:17:27,503 --> 01:17:29,664
God damn it, Barry.

1194
01:17:36,279 --> 01:17:38,008
lt--

1195
01:17:51,127 --> 01:17:52,754
All right.

1196
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:59,065
l admit l had sex
with her

1197
01:17:59,102 --> 01:18:01,627
once in the car.

1198
01:18:01,671 --> 01:18:04,572
But she-- she came onto me
so many times.

1199
01:18:04,607 --> 01:18:07,132
She was like a Lolita.
You have no idea,

1200
01:18:07,176 --> 01:18:10,236
honey, the lengths that this girl
went to to seduce me.

1201
01:18:11,581 --> 01:18:13,572
And l--

1202
01:18:15,251 --> 01:18:18,243
Yeah, l got weak.
All right? l admit it.

1203
01:18:18,287 --> 01:18:20,653
But l didn't rape her.

1204
01:18:23,126 --> 01:18:24,855
Seduce you?

1205
01:18:26,562 --> 01:18:29,588
l don't even know
who you are anymore.

1206
01:18:29,632 --> 01:18:32,157
You're the grownup.

1207
01:18:32,201 --> 01:18:34,567
- You should have known better!
- l know! l know!

1208
01:18:39,876 --> 01:18:41,343
ls it me?

1209
01:18:41,377 --> 01:18:43,811
ls it because l'm just so
fat and ugly now

1210
01:18:43,846 --> 01:18:46,314
- you have to go out and fuck someone?
- No no no no.

1211
01:18:46,349 --> 01:18:48,283
No, honey, l love you.
l love you.

1212
01:18:48,317 --> 01:18:50,410
You're the most beautiful woman
l've ever known and l love you.

1213
01:18:54,957 --> 01:18:56,857
l'm so sorry.

1214
01:19:29,425 --> 01:19:31,154
l'm sorry.

1215
01:19:39,535 --> 01:19:41,696
Okay.

1216
01:19:41,737 --> 01:19:43,898
You know what?

1217
01:19:43,940 --> 01:19:46,704
l've heard everything
l needed to hear, okay?

1218
01:19:47,743 --> 01:19:50,007
l'm going back to Philly
to have the baby there.

1219
01:19:50,046 --> 01:19:52,139
Don't go.

1220
01:19:52,181 --> 01:19:54,513
l hope she was worth it.

1221
01:20:04,794 --> 01:20:07,991
How about some stir-fried
chicken and vegetables?

1222
01:20:08,030 --> 01:20:10,123
How does that sound?
Does that sound good?

1223
01:20:10,166 --> 01:20:11,793
No.

1224
01:20:13,569 --> 01:20:15,935
Now, Megan,
if you want to eat ice cream,

1225
01:20:15,972 --> 01:20:18,031
you have to eat
a healthier meal, okay?

1226
01:20:18,074 --> 01:20:20,372
- Okay.
- Okay.

1227
01:20:20,409 --> 01:20:22,604
All right, l'll be right back.

1228
01:20:22,645 --> 01:20:25,170
- You are the guarder of the bags.
- Okay.

1229
01:20:25,214 --> 01:20:26,579
- You are in charge.
- Okay.

1230
01:20:26,616 --> 01:20:28,106
- All right?
- Uh-huh.

1231
01:20:54,277 --> 01:20:56,507
You must be Megan.

1232
01:20:56,546 --> 01:20:58,673
l'm your mother's friend Joe.

1233
01:21:01,417 --> 01:21:03,908
This is Marty...

1234
01:21:03,953 --> 01:21:05,580
Listen, l've got some good news.

1235
01:21:19,969 --> 01:21:21,596
Megan?

1236
01:21:28,211 --> 01:21:30,111
Megan?

1237
01:21:34,784 --> 01:21:36,649
Excuse me, did you happen
to see a little girl?

1238
01:21:36,686 --> 01:21:39,018
She was sitting right here.
She had a purple shirt on.

1239
01:21:39,055 --> 01:21:41,523
She had a purple shirt on,
short brown hair.

1240
01:21:41,557 --> 01:21:44,025
No, l was turned around.

1241
01:21:44,060 --> 01:21:46,221
Megan?

1242
01:21:46,262 --> 01:21:48,355
My little girl was just sitting
here a minute ago.

1243
01:21:48,397 --> 01:21:50,388
No one? You didn't see
her leave or anything?

1244
01:21:50,433 --> 01:21:52,128
Oh my God.

1245
01:21:52,168 --> 01:21:54,568
Megan!

1246
01:21:57,940 --> 01:21:59,601
Megan!

1247
01:22:00,610 --> 01:22:02,805
Megan!
Oh my God.

1248
01:22:02,845 --> 01:22:05,939
Megan! Oh my God.
Somebody help me.

1249
01:22:05,982 --> 01:22:08,974
( sobbing )
Megan!

1250
01:22:09,018 --> 01:22:11,953
My little girl was sitting right here.

1251
01:22:11,988 --> 01:22:14,923
All l did was go to get some food

1252
01:22:14,957 --> 01:22:16,754
and l don't know where she is now.

1253
01:22:16,792 --> 01:22:18,316
Control, stand by.

1254
01:22:19,428 --> 01:22:20,986
Willie:
## And l'm dead drunk on the playground ##

1255
01:22:21,063 --> 01:22:23,793
## Today ##

1256
01:22:23,833 --> 01:22:25,698
## l scare the kids ##

1257
01:22:25,735 --> 01:22:30,035
## Who come here to play ##

1258
01:22:30,072 --> 01:22:33,564
## And, Amanda,
won't you come back ##

1259
01:22:33,609 --> 01:22:36,476
## 'Cause my brain ##

1260
01:22:36,512 --> 01:22:41,848
## lt cannot live at all this way ##

1261
01:22:43,019 --> 01:22:46,386
## 'Cause you had to do
your thing ##

1262
01:22:46,422 --> 01:22:49,880
## l had to do my thing ##

1263
01:22:49,925 --> 01:22:53,190
## But we both
did nothing at all. ##

1264
01:22:58,100 --> 01:23:00,364
- Holy shit, man.
- What?

1265
01:23:00,403 --> 01:23:01,927
What?

1266
01:23:01,971 --> 01:23:04,462
Those guys look just like
the Candid Camera Killers, man.

1267
01:23:04,507 --> 01:23:06,407
The two guys that killed
the fucking cop.

1268
01:23:06,442 --> 01:23:09,343
Oh my gosh.
Should we like call the cops or something?

1269
01:23:09,378 --> 01:23:11,073
What are you talking about?

1270
01:23:11,113 --> 01:23:14,981
On the news they showed dashboard
footage of two guys killing a fucking cop

1271
01:23:15,017 --> 01:23:17,144
and they looked just like
them motherfuckers, man.

1272
01:23:17,186 --> 01:23:20,053
Carl:
No way, l know those guys.

1273
01:23:20,089 --> 01:23:22,023
lt wasn't them.
Those are nice guys.

1274
01:23:22,058 --> 01:23:24,049
How the fuck do you know them?

1275
01:23:24,093 --> 01:23:26,118
The other night when you
were in the diner

1276
01:23:26,162 --> 01:23:27,789
they came in.

1277
01:23:27,830 --> 01:23:30,298
l couldn't get
the register open, right?

1278
01:23:30,333 --> 01:23:33,393
They gave me 40 bucks for like
10 bucks worth of shit

1279
01:23:33,436 --> 01:23:35,233
and they said keep the change.

1280
01:23:35,271 --> 01:23:37,034
Those are nice guys.

1281
01:23:37,073 --> 01:23:38,802
l thought you said nobody
came in here, man.

1282
01:23:38,841 --> 01:23:41,401
Oh, l did?
Oh. l lied.

1283
01:23:41,444 --> 01:23:43,071
Fucking asshole.

1284
01:23:46,349 --> 01:23:48,010
Amanda:
Um, they're coming in here.

1285
01:23:48,050 --> 01:23:50,917
All right, Amanda, just get to
the bathroom and stay there, all right?

1286
01:24:14,477 --> 01:24:17,139
- Sherri.
- Barry.

1287
01:24:17,179 --> 01:24:19,170
Mr. Krebbs.

1288
01:24:20,182 --> 01:24:23,174
ls that what you want me to call you
when you're fucking me?

1289
01:24:27,089 --> 01:24:28,886
- ( sobbing )
- Holly.

1290
01:24:28,924 --> 01:24:32,223
l just fucked Mr. Krebbs.

1291
01:24:32,261 --> 01:24:34,320
ln the school parking lot.

1292
01:24:34,363 --> 01:24:36,695
Meet me at Denny's immediately.

1293
01:24:36,732 --> 01:24:38,495
( sighs )

1294
01:24:41,537 --> 01:24:43,232
l'm sorry.

1295
01:24:44,373 --> 01:24:46,933
( sobbing )

1296
01:24:56,018 --> 01:24:57,451
- Hey.
- Hey.

1297
01:24:58,954 --> 01:25:00,785
You're the new guy.
l remember.

1298
01:25:00,823 --> 01:25:02,916
Carl: That's me.

1299
01:25:02,958 --> 01:25:05,290
What are you doing
on this side of the counter?

1300
01:25:05,327 --> 01:25:07,887
l got fired.

1301
01:25:10,833 --> 01:25:13,461
lt's a tough business,
this mini-mart shit, huh?

1302
01:25:16,005 --> 01:25:17,870
$16.68.

1303
01:25:29,051 --> 01:25:31,246
All right, thanks.

1304
01:25:39,528 --> 01:25:41,723
That's them, man.

1305
01:25:41,764 --> 01:25:43,356
What are you doing?

1306
01:25:43,399 --> 01:25:46,027
Calling the fucking cops, man.

1307
01:25:48,437 --> 01:25:51,304
Hello.
Yes, the Candid Camera Killers.

1308
01:25:51,340 --> 01:25:52,864
The two guys that killed the cop,

1309
01:25:52,908 --> 01:25:54,398
they're leaving my convenience store

1310
01:25:54,443 --> 01:25:57,105
on Huber and 15th right now
in a black car.

1311
01:25:57,146 --> 01:26:00,047
Their license plate

1312
01:26:00,082 --> 01:26:04,451
is F-O-O-T-D-O-C.

1313
01:26:04,487 --> 01:26:07,115
We've called the police.
They're on their way.

1314
01:26:07,156 --> 01:26:09,147
Our staff, they're combing
the mall right now.

1315
01:26:09,191 --> 01:26:11,159
Have you been able to
reach your husband yet?

1316
01:26:11,193 --> 01:26:14,993
No, he has his fucking
phone turned off.

1317
01:26:21,103 --> 01:26:22,832
All right.

1318
01:26:22,872 --> 01:26:25,602
We got some good news
and we got some bad news.

1319
01:26:25,641 --> 01:26:29,077
She admitted it
wasn't a forcible rape.

1320
01:26:29,111 --> 01:26:30,874
Thank God.

1321
01:26:30,913 --> 01:26:32,642
Not so fast.

1322
01:26:32,681 --> 01:26:36,412
Bad news is statutory rape
is still rape in the eyes of the law.

1323
01:26:41,423 --> 01:26:43,254
Ben, you've got to
get me out of this.

1324
01:26:43,292 --> 01:26:47,319
l mean, she came on to me.
The tape proves that, right?

1325
01:26:47,363 --> 01:26:49,126
lt doesn't matter.

1326
01:26:49,164 --> 01:26:52,861
Look, she could be wearing
two band-aids,

1327
01:26:52,902 --> 01:26:55,393
a dollop of whipped cream,
six-inch fuck-me pumps

1328
01:26:55,437 --> 01:26:56,563
and begging for it.

1329
01:26:56,605 --> 01:26:59,972
lf she's a minor, you as the adult
are supposed to walk away.

1330
01:27:00,009 --> 01:27:01,738
l know.

1331
01:27:01,777 --> 01:27:05,736
l'm not saying it doesn't go
against every male instinct

1332
01:27:05,781 --> 01:27:08,750
that has been genetically passed
down through millions of years.

1333
01:27:08,784 --> 01:27:11,184
l mean, between you and me,
l've seen her.

1334
01:27:11,220 --> 01:27:14,280
Would have been a tough call
for any man.

1335
01:27:14,323 --> 01:27:17,019
You did it,
those are facts.

1336
01:27:20,796 --> 01:27:22,661
So what happens next?

1337
01:27:22,698 --> 01:27:24,598
Look, it's all on tape.

1338
01:27:25,601 --> 01:27:27,330
You've got to plead no contest
and hope

1339
01:27:27,369 --> 01:27:30,065
that because this is your first offense
you can get away with minimum.

1340
01:27:31,874 --> 01:27:35,071
So can l get off with like a fine
or something and community service?

1341
01:27:37,246 --> 01:27:39,180
You don't watch much TV,
do you?

1342
01:27:40,716 --> 01:27:42,308
Look,

1343
01:27:42,351 --> 01:27:45,252
if a person convicted
of statutory rape

1344
01:27:45,287 --> 01:27:48,450
is 21 years of age or older,
that's you,

1345
01:27:48,490 --> 01:27:52,051
and is eight years or more than
eight years older than the victim,

1346
01:27:52,094 --> 01:27:54,255
which is also you,

1347
01:27:54,296 --> 01:27:57,754
then no part of the minimum
sentence can be stayed,

1348
01:27:57,800 --> 01:27:59,825
probated or suspended.

1349
01:27:59,868 --> 01:28:01,631
What the hell does that mean?

1350
01:28:01,670 --> 01:28:04,332
l mean, what--
what's the minimum?

1351
01:28:04,373 --> 01:28:06,364
10 years.

1352
01:28:10,379 --> 01:28:12,609
And it could have been so much worse.
lt could have been 20.

1353
01:28:12,648 --> 01:28:16,277
But because she lied
and we have the evidence on tape

1354
01:28:16,318 --> 01:28:18,752
l'm sure that we can get the minimum.

1355
01:28:20,356 --> 01:28:24,156
Of course, you'll have to register
as a sex offender when you get out.

1356
01:28:24,193 --> 01:28:26,388
And, uh,

1357
01:28:26,428 --> 01:28:28,328
forget about teaching ever again.

1358
01:28:28,364 --> 01:28:30,798
And as far as your
unborn child goes,

1359
01:28:30,833 --> 01:28:33,734
you can forget about custody.
That's gonna be impossible.

1360
01:28:33,769 --> 01:28:36,670
But l can probably get you
supervised visitation rights.

1361
01:28:38,374 --> 01:28:39,898
All in all you're getting off
pretty easy.

1362
01:28:39,942 --> 01:28:41,773
( helicopter whirring )

1363
01:28:43,212 --> 01:28:46,147
- ( police radio chatter )
- ( siren blaring )

1364
01:28:59,528 --> 01:29:01,086
Man:
l'm sorry to cut you off, Bonnie,

1365
01:29:01,130 --> 01:29:04,065
but what we're looking at here
is a high-speed pursuit in progress.

1366
01:29:04,099 --> 01:29:06,727
Police believe that
the Candid Camera Killers,

1367
01:29:06,769 --> 01:29:09,101
the alleged murderers
of Officer Lawrence Garby,

1368
01:29:09,138 --> 01:29:10,400
architect Stanley Jeffers

1369
01:29:10,439 --> 01:29:13,465
and abductors of Francine Figgs
are in that black sedan

1370
01:29:13,509 --> 01:29:15,409
heading north on lnterstate 17.

1371
01:29:15,444 --> 01:29:18,174
- Can you believe this?
- Shit, man.

1372
01:29:18,213 --> 01:29:21,273
- A fast-thinking Quickie Mart clerk...
- Shit.

1373
01:29:21,316 --> 01:29:24,251
...took a picture of the license plate with
a video phone mere moments ago.

1374
01:29:24,286 --> 01:29:26,220
l could have been fucking killed.

1375
01:29:26,255 --> 01:29:28,382
No shit, man.

1376
01:29:45,474 --> 01:29:49,001
We've seen some harrowing near misses
in speeds in excess of 80mph.

1377
01:29:49,044 --> 01:29:52,673
The stolen car is registered
to a Dr. Vanay Rubastaba.

1378
01:29:52,715 --> 01:29:54,706
( reporter speaking in Spanish )

1379
01:29:56,452 --> 01:29:58,886
- ( sirens blaring )

- Oh shit!

1381

Reporter: Whoa, did you see that?
That looks bad.

1382
01:30:50,239 --> 01:30:51,797
Motherfucker, man!

1383
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:53,933
- Oh my God.
- Damn.

1384
01:30:55,744 --> 01:30:57,837

Louise!
Baby, what happened?

1386
01:31:00,149 --> 01:31:01,776
- What happened?
- Oh, God, Ben.

1387
01:31:01,817 --> 01:31:03,751
l was just getting some food

1388
01:31:03,786 --> 01:31:06,619
and l swear to God
l was just 10 feet away from her.

1389
01:31:06,655 --> 01:31:08,714
l swear to God
l just looked for a second.

1390
01:31:08,757 --> 01:31:11,351
Why can't they find her, Ben?

1391
01:31:11,393 --> 01:31:14,328
- Why can't they find her?
- Shh.

## You were someone else's lie ##

1396
01:33:15,784 --> 01:33:18,912
## So you trash a little light ##

1397
01:33:20,355 --> 01:33:23,153
## And when the colors seem to fade ##

1398
01:33:23,191 --> 01:33:26,251
## Everything is black and gray ##

1399
01:33:26,295 --> 01:33:28,820
## l couldn't look ##

1400
01:33:28,864 --> 01:33:32,061
## l couldn't walk away ##

1401

## 'Cause you couldn't stay ##

1402
01:33:37,105 --> 01:33:41,064

## Darling, save your love for me ##

1404

## lf only you could set me free ##

1405
01:33:52,254 --> 01:33:55,519
## Then l could live again ##

1406
01:33:57,125 --> 01:34:01,221
## We'll start it where the story ends ##

1407

## Look into this broken lens ##

1410
01:34:21,616 --> 01:34:24,744
## And we can write the end ##

1411
01:34:26,621 --> 01:34:30,648
## We'll start it where
the story ends. ##

1412
01:34:43,205 --> 01:34:45,139
l got the photo of the damage

1413
01:34:45,173 --> 01:34:47,300
and it looks like they
clobbered you pretty good.

1414
01:34:47,342 --> 01:34:51,073
lt looks like that
back rear-panel section

1415
01:34:51,113 --> 01:34:52,671
is probably gonna
have to go entirely.

1416
01:34:52,714 --> 01:34:54,648
But the sides are--

1417
01:34:54,683 --> 01:34:56,480
there's just one little scratch, right.

1418
01:34:56,518 --> 01:34:58,782
And l think the best way
to go about that

1419
01:34:58,820 --> 01:35:00,253
would be to--

1420
01:35:00,288 --> 01:35:02,415
Are you Martin Dougle?

1421
01:35:08,397 --> 01:35:10,024
Yes.

1422
01:35:10,065 --> 01:35:12,863

why l'm here.

1423

'Cause it's your birthday!
