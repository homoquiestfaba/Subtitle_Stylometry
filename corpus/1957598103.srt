1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:04,437
(dramatic music)

2
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:46,546
- What's the story with our
whisky production this week?

3
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:47,847
- Well, whisky we're doing okay.

4
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:50,183
Got 1,500 cases coming
down with Joe Kennedy.

5
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:51,017
- Good, good.

6
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:52,085
How about the beer?

7
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:53,486
- The beer, not so good.

8
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:54,554
But we'll have
another brewery up

9
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:55,722
by the end of the month.

10
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,195
Listen, boss.

11
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:03,129
Do you really think
you should be going

12
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:04,497
to this meeting in Hoboken?

13
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:06,800
I mean, this business
with Dutch Schultz,

14
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,701
it's really starting to heat up.

15
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:11,004
- Hey, don't worry
about it, huh?

16
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:12,172
Come on.

17
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:14,941
(dramatic music)

18
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,243
Max, pull over.

19
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:53,012
- What's the matter?

20
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,182
- Just stop the car!

21
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:57,317
- All right, all right.

22
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:01,254
(dramatic music)

23
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:10,697
Why don't I go check
out the sights?

24
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:12,799
- Yeah, you do that.

25
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,000
- [Max] If we miss this train,

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,902
we'll be late for the meeting.

27
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:18,638
(dramatic music)

28
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:31,985
(girl moans)

29
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,656
(tense music)

30
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,462
(train honks)

31
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:45,632
- [Conductor] Hoboken!

32
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,767
Hoboken Station, next stop!

33
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,709
(tense music)

34
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,092
- Why is it that my
car is not out here

35
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:14,027
waiting for me, Max?

36
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,061
- I don't know, boss.

37
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,933
- Why is everyone still
standing around here?

38
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,035
Am I supposed to walk?

39
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,236
- Get Mr. Diamond a car!

40
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:27,307
- Morning, ladies.

41
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:28,508
- [Woman] Good morning.

42
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:29,442
- Looks like you
could use some help.

43
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:30,276
- Mhm.

44
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:31,511
- [Woman] Yeah.

45
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:32,745
- I'm Jack Diamond, and
it would be a pleasure

46
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:34,581
to help such lovely
ladies as yourselves.

47
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:35,848
- Thank you.

48
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:37,183
I told her she was
bringing too much.

49
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:38,384
- Don't listen to her.

50
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,220
Most of this is
yours anyway, Marge.

51
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:46,326
(guns firing)

52
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:49,262
(people screaming)

53
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:13,620
(tense music)

54
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:18,291
(man groans)

55
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:45,018
- Can you believe this, Max?

56
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:48,655
What's this country coming to?

57
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:56,929
Can you believe the
balls on this guy

58
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:58,364
trying to hit us on
the way to the meeting?

59
00:04:58,364 --> 00:04:59,632
- He must've known
exactly when our train

60
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,167
was coming in from upstate.

61
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:03,536
- Wait 'til Luciano and the
commission hear about this.

62
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:09,108
Lucky, the commission
sets up this meeting,

63
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:10,943
and this bastard
tries to kill me

64
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:11,978
as I'm coming to it!

65
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:16,616
- Handkerchief.

66
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:19,385
- [Jack] That ain't
the way it should be.

67
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:21,654
Tony, Frenchie, am I right?

68
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,923
- [Dutch] I can't stand to
be in the same room with you.

69
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:25,158
- What a shame.

70
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,395
- It's this guy's fault.

71
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:31,431
He's trying to move
in on my rackets!

72
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:32,598
- It's my fault?

73
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,567
Listen to his
huffin' and puffin'.

74
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:37,070
Come here, come here!

75
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,772
- What are you givin'
me the look for?

76
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:41,574
You see this?

77
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:43,042
This is his fault,

78
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:43,943
I don't even know why I'm
talking to this piece of crap.

79
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:44,844
- He's the one.

80
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,079
He's hitting my trucks!

81
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,413
- He's trying to
take over my rackets!

82
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:49,749
- You're a fuckin' liar!

83
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:50,950
- You callin' me a liar?

84
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,185
- You're damn right
I'm calling you a liar.

85
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,419
Come here!

86
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:54,420
- [Dutch] Listen,
you Irish mick!

87
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:56,756
- Cheating bastard!

88
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:58,725
You ignorant son of a bitch!

89
00:05:58,725 --> 00:05:59,592
- This guy...

90
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,863
- This is a bunch of crap!

91
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,865
(glass breaks)

92
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,467
- Well, let's take it outside.

93
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:08,701
- Let's go.

94
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:13,272
- All right, enough!

95
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:14,640
- I want the offshore!

96
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,541
(glass breaks)

97
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,476
- Gentlemen!

98
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,010
- I want the Garment District!

99
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:18,845
- Enough!

100
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:20,646
Gentlemen!

101
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:26,586
We are going to
restore some dignity

102
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:29,288
to these proceedings.

103
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,593
Jack, you and Dutch here,

104
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,132
you came to me.

105
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:43,169
You came to me out of
respect for the commission,

106
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,338
and you came to this meeting

107
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:50,343
because this meeting is
to our mutual benefit.

108
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,645
Now, you have grievances.

109
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:57,150
And we are all well
aware of your grievances.

110
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:00,286
- Thank you, Lucky, thank you.

111
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:04,123
- So then you tell me,
what do you want to do?

112
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:04,957
- Thank you.

113
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,132
I want the Garment District.

114
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:13,966
- [Lucky] Jack?

115
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:15,535
- I want the trucking.

116
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:16,736
I want the trucking.

117
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,205
I got all this hooch in Canada,

118
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:20,706
I want to get it moved.

119
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:26,913
I want safe passage from my
men from Canada to downtown.

120
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:29,649
You know what I'm talking about.

121
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,617
- I want the offshore,

122
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,686
'cause this prick
ain't running it right.

123
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:35,888
You understand?

124
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:39,959
Really.
- Come here!

125
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,327
Come here!

126
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:43,196
- Don't you...

127
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,730
- [Lucky] Gentlemen!

128
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,399
- [Jack] Okay, okay.

129
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,333
Legs ain't runnin' for shit.

130
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:49,068
- All right.

131
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:51,471
- You got it.

132
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,672
- All right.

133
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:56,209
I officially declare
this meeting adjourned.

134
00:07:58,611 --> 00:07:59,445
All right?

135
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:03,182
- After you.

136
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:05,551
- You want me to go first?

137
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:06,486
You want me to go outside first?

138
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,720
- Go right ahead.

139
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,121
- Biggest mistake you ever made.

140
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:10,690
- Yeah, we'll see about that.

141
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:14,727
Come on!
- We're leaving.

142
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:17,230
(tense music)

143
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:28,140
- Look at this crap!

144
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,176
They're calling it a
full scale mob warrant,

145
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,544
the streets of our nation.

146
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:33,679
Where do these
newshounds get the gall

147
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,249
to print baloney like this?

148
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,352
- They're just trying
to sell papers, chief.

149
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,353
- Well, that may be.

150
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,555
But I don't like it.

151
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:44,757
They're doing it at
our expense, see?

152
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:47,093
They're trying to make the
bureau a laughingstock.

153
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:52,365
- We just may have an
opportunity here, chief.

154
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,969
Innocent people are being
killed by these gangsters.

155
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,173
Now, when the safety of the
American people is in jeopardy,

156
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:03,576
who's concerned the most?

157
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,444
- The president, of course.

158
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:06,679
- Right.

159
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:10,616
What we have here is a
mandate for the bureau.

160
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:13,953
You've been trying for years

161
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:16,422
to get a decent budget from
those tightwads in Congress.

162
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:19,325
- God damn Volstead Act.

163
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:20,760
It was all the
Prohibition enforcement

164
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,329
of those assholes at
the Treasury Department.

165
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:25,898
- We need the newspapers
to stir up public opinion,

166
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:31,304
then we can nail these gangsters

167
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:34,006
with your public safety idea.

168
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:35,841
- Yeah.

169
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:38,477
Yeah, sure.

170
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:42,815
- Well, we can identify Dutch
Schultz and Jack Diamond

171
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:44,283
at the scene of the shootout.

172
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,954
But nobody's gonna
testify against them.

173
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:53,259
We don't know enough about
their individual operations.

174
00:09:57,563 --> 00:10:00,199
But if we can place one
of our own men in there...

175
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:04,070
- You mean infiltrate?

176
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,638
One of the gangs?

177
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:06,472
Hm.

178
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:14,380
Sounds too risky.

179
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,116
Besides...

180
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,053
Who could we get to pass?

181
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:25,791
My boys don't look like
gangsters, for Christ's sakes.

182
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:28,728
- Sir, we've gotta
make a federal case

183
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:29,996
out of these rackets

184
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:32,865
to show the president
that we mean business.

185
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:37,870
You get his attention, and
you'll have your budget.

186
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:45,077
I know just the man for the job.

187
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:55,187
(lighthearted jazz music)

188
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:12,505
- Here you go, bum.

189
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:15,207
Fetch.

190
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:21,447
Hey, I got plenty more
where that came from.

191
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,921
You don't thank me or nothin'.

192
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:33,459
(train honks)

193
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,863
Yeah, looks like we're
coming into the station.

194
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:41,100
You better watch out
for the yard bulls.

195
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:44,170
- Hey, kid.

196
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,071
Thanks for the smoke.

197
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,506
- All right.

198
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:12,098
(man hums)

199
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:16,669
- Howdy.

200
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,241
How about a cup of coffee?

201
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:24,443
- Who the hell are you?

202
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,245
- Nobody.

203
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,115
- All right, Nobody.

204
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:31,584
Have a seat, grab
yourself a cup of coffee.

205
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:33,586
- Thank you.

206
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:41,460
- How do we know he ain't
a railway man spying on us?

207
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,728
Where you from anyway?

208
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:44,330
I ain't never seen you
in these parts before,

209
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,598
what's your name?

210
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:47,733
- You sure ask a
lot of questions

211
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:49,835
for a man who just
wants a cup of coffee.

212
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:50,836
- Leave him be, Earl.

213
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:54,707
Can't you see he's just a
regular Joe looking for a break?

214
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:55,741
- Don't mind Earl.

215
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,677
We just have to be
careful, that's all.

216
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:02,047
All the yard bulls, cops,
and gangsters around.

217
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:04,116
Can't be too sure who to trust.

218
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,317
Understand?

219
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:07,186
- I heard that, I
don't want no trouble.

220
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:08,020
- Good.

221
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:10,556
Times are tough for everybody.

222
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:12,558
We can't be fighting
among ourselves.

223
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:13,559
- Thank you kindly.

224
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,593
- Uh huh.

225
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:15,728
No problem at all.

226
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:24,236
Don't taste too
good, but it's hot.

227
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:27,973
See, we're all
family around here.

228
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:31,043
Come from different places,

229
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:33,779
but we got to stick together
if we're gonna survive.

230
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:37,416
(gun fires)

231
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:38,651
- All right.

232
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,718
Nobody moves.

233
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:41,554
- See?

234
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:42,488
What'd I tell you?

235
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,389
He's with them.

236
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:44,190
- Shut up, Earl!

237
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,090
Don't prove nothin'.

238
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:48,027
- Washburn.

239
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,196
What the hell did I tell ya?

240
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:51,964
- I'm sorry, boss.

241
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:56,235
We's wanted to leave,
but we got a sick child.

242
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:57,069
(baby cries)

243
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:58,370
And she can't travel.

244
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:01,841
(dramatic music)

245
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,409
- You bastards!

246
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,878
(gun fires)

247
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:08,547
(woman screams)

248
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:16,222
- You see that, Roy?

249
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:19,859
That fool was attacking
an officer of the law.

250
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,160
- Yup, I saw.

251
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,529
Ain't smart to do.

252
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,831
(Red chuckles)

253
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:28,033
- No, it ain't too smart.

254
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:35,608
What you lookin' at, boy?

255
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,378
(guns cocking)

256
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,881
(tense music)

257
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,461
(Red chuckles)

258
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:56,295
Hey, now.

259
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:59,231
We got us a fightin' boy here.

260
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,334
You a fightin' boy, son?

261
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:06,739
- I don't want to
have to hurt anybody,

262
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,140
but I'll fight if I have to.

263
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:12,378
- Well, you're gonna have to.

264
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:14,346
- Don't be a fool,
they'll kill you.

265
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:15,814
- Let it go.

266
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:17,116
You'll wind up a dead man.

267
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:21,086
(dramatic music)

268
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,688
- That's right, Roy.

269
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,056
Hit him!

270
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,157
Get him, Roy!

271
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:31,497
(dramatic music)
(man grunts)

272
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,768
You guys get in there!

273
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,203
Come on, get in there!

274
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:40,940
(dramatic music)

275
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:50,115
Get in, get in there!

276
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,383
Come on, go on!

277
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:54,420
Get in there!

278
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,790
(tense music)

279
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,977
Burn the place!

280
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:21,547
We'll figure out what
to do with him later.

281
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:28,854
- That's the only man to
stand up to these bastards.

282
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,422
Look at what it gets him.

283
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,726
(fire burns)

284
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:41,200
(dramatic music)

285
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:55,581
- Wait in the car.

286
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:57,149
- What am I, a dog?

287
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,818
- Yeah, you're my pet.

288
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:01,153
Stay.

289
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,554
No, I should take you in there

290
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:04,323
and feed you to the convicts.

291
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:08,961
That's what I should do to you.

292
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:11,497
Don't turn your back on me.

293
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:13,932
Hey, I'm talking to you.

294
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:17,102
(dramatic jazz music)

295
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:34,219
Red, where are you?

296
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,554
- In here, boss.

297
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,793
- Now what did I tell you?

298
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,394
Are you gonna clean
this mess up or what?

299
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,963
I mean, what am I
paying you for, huh?

300
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:46,565
I'm paying this whole
God damn lousy town

301
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,599
and I'm fed up!

302
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,235
I don't care that you're cops,

303
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,570
you're all the same.

304
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,072
You step out of line,

305
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,707
I'll deal with you the same
way I deal with everyone.

306
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:57,810
We understand each other?

307
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,278
- Yeah, I understand.

308
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:03,015
You hear that, Roy?

309
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,716
You better shape up!

310
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:06,785
Mr. Diamond here
expects a lot out of ya.

311
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,154
- Hey, Red.

312
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:12,357
Nice shine.

313
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:13,325
What happened?

314
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:14,827
Another fight with the missus?

315
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:18,097
- No, it was this punk.

316
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:18,931
- Yeah?

317
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:20,966
Good job, pal.

318
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:22,835
- I ain't your pal.

319
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,503
Screw you.

320
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:25,337
- What'd you say?

321
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:26,405
- I said screw you.

322
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:28,841
Screw all of yas.

323
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:31,343
- Let him out, Red.

324
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,655
- All right, let's
go, tough guy.

325
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,928
- You know who
you're talking to?

326
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:51,897
You know who he is?

327
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:54,566
- Your boyfriend?

328
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,739
- So you're a tough guy, huh?

329
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:03,108
- Tough enough.

330
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:04,109
- Yeah, well I'm gonna-

331
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:06,178
- Hold on a second, Charlie.

332
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:07,012
That ain't fair.

333
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:09,448
The guy's in chains.

334
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:10,616
- Yeah, so what?

335
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:11,917
- 'Cause it ain't fair!

336
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:16,288
See what the hobo can do
without the chains on.

337
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:21,994
(melancholic saxophone music)

338
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:24,997
What's he in for?

339
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,099
- Murder, down at
the railroad yard.

340
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:28,767
- All the better.

341
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:30,002
This oughta be good.

342
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,404
Take his chains off.

343
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:33,572
- [Charlie] You won't me to-

344
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:34,640
- Don't make me
repeat myself, do it!

345
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,409
All right, I got
five on the hobo.

346
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:38,544
Come on, who'll match me?

347
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:39,478
Come on.

348
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:40,279
- [Man] Right here, right here.

349
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,181
- Let's go, come on.

350
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,782
All right, all right, let's go,

351
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:45,684
let's have a fight
here, come on.

352
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,519
How much you got, huh?

353
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:50,322
That's all you got?

354
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:51,623
Come on.

355
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:54,059
(men chattering)

356
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,294
This fight's gonna
be a good one.

357
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:58,830
All right, come on,
come on, come on.

358
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,765
Good, good.

359
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,102
(men yelling)

360
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:19,718
(Jack laughs)

361
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,120
All right, all right, come on.

362
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,290
Charlie, you're no
good, you're a bum!

363
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:28,827
(men yelling)

364
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:38,570
- Charlie, he's a punk
for crying out loud!

365
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,639
Would you put him away?

366
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:43,108
(men yelling)

367
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:53,986
- Come on!

368
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:03,028
Oh, not bad!

369
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:04,963
Not bad at all.

370
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:06,131
- Anybody else want any?

371
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:06,965
- Oh!

372
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:09,134
All right fellas, come
on, pay up, pay up.

373
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:10,702
What do you got here, huh?

374
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:11,937
What'd I tell ya?

375
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,538
All right, there we
go, that's the money.

376
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:15,007
Hey, put that rod away!

377
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:15,841
- I'm gonna kill him.

378
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:17,142
- No you ain't!

379
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:19,077
Only I say who gets
it, you hear me?

380
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:20,579
Now go get your face washed.

381
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:21,980
Get outta here, go on!

382
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,986
You're a good fighter.

383
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:28,854
What's your name?

384
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:30,589
- Bone Conn.

385
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:33,659
- Nice name.

386
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,227
I won't ask you how you got it.

387
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:37,763
You know, I could use a new man.

388
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:39,998
- I'm busy.

389
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:41,466
I'm on my way to the pen.

390
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,768
- Don't worry
about these clowns,

391
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:43,702
they do what I say.

392
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:45,537
- What?

393
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:47,072
You want me to release him?

394
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:49,741
- [Jack] Yeah, I want
you to release him.

395
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:51,343
That is, if you want a job.

396
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:52,577
- Sure.

397
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:54,513
I'd like to know who
I'm working for though.

398
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:56,615
- The name's Diamond,
Jack Diamond.

399
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:02,087
Now I want you to get
some duds, get a shave,

400
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:04,256
be at my office
tomorrow morning.

401
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:06,024
I got enough bums
working for me,

402
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:07,793
I don't need another one.

403
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:08,627
Come on, baby.

404
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:12,698
(romantic jazz music)

405
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:49,401
- Cellar, tell the Dutchman
I got O"Brien out here.

406
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:53,905
(dramatic music)

407
00:22:57,075 --> 00:22:57,876
- O'Brien.

408
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:02,247
- Mr. Schultz, I...

409
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:08,520
- I don't think
this Irish potato

410
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,222
knows the kind of
trouble he's in.

411
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,658
You want to live, don't ya?

412
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:19,564
Get that hat off.

413
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:21,833
Give me that.

414
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:25,237
You know what?

415
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,708
Yeah.

416
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:32,310
(man laughing)

417
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:34,679
Yeah.

418
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:43,755
I hear you've been
buying from Legs.

419
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,590
Come on, come on.

420
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:48,560
Don't bullshit me.

421
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,665
Whose territory is this?

422
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:54,599
Whose?

423
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,867
- [O'Brien] It's yours, Dutch.

424
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:57,702
- That's right.

425
00:23:58,670 --> 00:23:59,471
Get out of here.

426
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:05,410
Give me a drink.

427
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:12,651
(lighthearted music)

428
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:26,731
- Come on, let me in there!

429
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:27,766
- No chance, beat it.

430
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,505
- How ya feelin' this
morning, Charlie?

431
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:34,773
- Been better.

432
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:36,374
- You're too happy.

433
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:42,013
- Hey, thanks.

434
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:43,782
Hey, wait a minute.

435
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:44,716
Don't I know you?

436
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:48,820
Yeah, you're that
bum from the train.

437
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,654
I don't get it.

438
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:53,258
- I got a job, I'm
working for Legs Diamond.

439
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:54,526
- You're working for Legs?

440
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:55,894
I've been waiting for
him out here all day,

441
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:56,828
I don't get it!

442
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:01,933
- Well, if it ain't the boxer.

443
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:03,401
- Here like you
told me to be, boss.

444
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:04,536
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

445
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:05,904
Come on, I got a job to do.

446
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:11,376
Who is he?

447
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:12,878
- Just some kid
looking for work.

448
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:13,712
- Yeah?

449
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:14,646
Get lost!

450
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:16,248
- But Mr. Diamond, Mr. Diamond!

451
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:19,551
I came all the way from
New York to see you.

452
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:21,486
I'm your sister's
husband's nephew.

453
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:22,821
- My sister?
- Yeah.

454
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:23,655
- That tramp.

455
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:24,489
Get him outta here.

456
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,193
- Mr. Diamond.

457
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,498
He's with me.

458
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:35,066
- Yeah, so?

459
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:35,967
- He's a good kid.

460
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,370
- What am I, a charity ward?

461
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:49,414
All right, he's in.

462
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:52,551
Max, give him some heat.

463
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:01,693
(lighthearted jazz music)

464
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:20,579
- Tony, I got eight bottles...

465
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:21,813
- Hey, beat it.

466
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,749
You scram!

467
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,384
- [Man] Sir, Mr. Diamond.

468
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:29,521
- Now...

469
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:34,459
What'd I tell you about
not buying my stuff?

470
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:36,861
- But Dutch says the same thing.

471
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:37,696
- Son of a bitch!

472
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,697
- Hey, what can I do?

473
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:40,699
- You do what I say, you got it?

474
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:42,367
- Yeah, but they'll
burn me down.

475
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:44,836
- Yeah?

476
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:45,971
Well, let me show
you what I'll do.

477
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:50,742
(dramatic music)

478
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:57,782
Hey, boys.

479
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,786
Maybe I should just
shoot this guy, huh?

480
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,321
Put someone else in charge.

481
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:06,925
Someone who ain't so
stupid as to take crap

482
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:08,727
from that jackass,
Dutch Schultz.

483
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:13,898
(glass breaks)

484
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:15,800
Get the son of a bitch!

485
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,803
(suspenseful music)

486
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:22,133
He went in that building,
go in and kill him!

487
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,443
(tense music)

488
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,223
- So now what do we do?

489
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:48,393
- Don't worry about it,
just get outta here.

490
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,261
- What, are you just
gonna shoot him?

491
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:51,096
- Go!

492
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:58,970
- Well, what happened?

493
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,739
I thought I told
you to pop the bum!

494
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,007
(gun fires)

495
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:12,617
- Take the first
train out of town,

496
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:14,018
I'm not saying it twice.

497
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:23,294
- Good.

498
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:24,496
Now that's the way
to waste a guy,

499
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:26,297
he emptied his whole clip.

500
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:28,967
- Maybe he's just a bad shot.

501
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:30,468
What's the matter, you
couldn't put one in his brain

502
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:31,469
and be done with it?

503
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,807
- Maybe you want to go up
there and look for yourself.

504
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:40,678
- Nah, come on.

505
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:42,180
Let's get a drink.

506
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,621
(catchy band music)

507
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:55,794
Drinks on the house.

508
00:29:57,395 --> 00:29:58,363
Everybody drink up.

509
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:03,568
Bone, that was good
today what you did.

510
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:05,770
You really showed me something.

511
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:06,604
- It was nothin', boss.

512
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:07,872
That bum had it coming.

513
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:11,709
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

514
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:14,212
I got some business
to attend to.

515
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:17,382
(slow romantic music)

516
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,248
- Hi.

517
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:51,049
- Hello.

518
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:54,485
- You new in town?

519
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:55,286
- Yeah.

520
00:30:57,755 --> 00:30:59,991
- You're a big talker, huh?

521
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:06,598
Why don't you ask me to dance?

522
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:09,767
(slow romantic music)

523
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:32,257
So, what brings you to town?

524
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:36,427
- I don't know.

525
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:37,962
One place is as
good as the next.

526
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:39,898
- You think so?

527
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:44,702
Some places have more
opportunities, wouldn't you say?

528
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:48,640
- If you play your cards right.

529
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,708
You seem to be doing
all right for yourself.

530
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:53,077
- You mean playing
my cards right?

531
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,949
- [Bone] You're playing
somebody, sister.

532
00:31:57,949 --> 00:31:59,717
- You're sort of
fresh, aren't you?

533
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,554
- Kiki.

534
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:10,361
Bone.

535
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:12,196
This is...

536
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:14,699
- Betty.
- Betty.

537
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:20,471
Why don't you show the
new guy a good time, huh?

538
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:21,306
Go on.

539
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,410
(slow romantic music)

540
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:32,150
Kiki.

541
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:34,786
Sing for me, baby.

542
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:48,566
- Ladies and gentlemen,
the lovely Kiki Roberts.

543
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:53,738
(people clapping)

544
00:32:57,041 --> 00:33:01,946
♪ Tell me you'll hold
me tonight, sweetheart ♪

545
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:09,320
♪ Tonight is all
I'll ask of you ♪

546
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:15,793
♪ And if tomorrow

547
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:17,028
- Hey, Max.

548
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:18,629
Isn't that Legs's dame?

549
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:19,864
- Uh huh.

550
00:33:19,864 --> 00:33:21,632
- She sings kinda-

551
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:23,668
- Great!

552
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,703
- Right.

553
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:27,905
- Regular nightingale.

554
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:31,075
♪ In my dreams tonight

555
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:35,213
♪ Your love will be true

556
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:37,348
♪ Your heart will

557
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,316
- Who's the new guy?

558
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:39,717
- I don't know, bud.

559
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:41,019
But I don't like him.

560
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,554
He's a little too slick.

561
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:46,024
He ain't some hobo who
just jumped off the train.

562
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:50,428
♪ Forever, my dear

563
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:54,265
♪ Forever you will love me so

564
00:33:58,002 --> 00:34:00,538
(Betty laughs)

565
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:06,978
- Oh!

566
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:12,784
(dramatic saxophone music)

567
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:31,369
Thank you.

568
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:48,820
And I'm really not
this type of girl,

569
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,656
I mean I usually don't
do this type of thing.

570
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:10,141
(romantic saxophone music)

571
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:40,171
- Break out the champagne.

572
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:41,606
I'll be back in two shakes.

573
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:44,775
Keep the bed warm.

574
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:53,784
(mysterious music)

575
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:14,872
(lighthearted music)

576
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,263
- Yeah, I'll call you back.

577
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:48,739
Sit down, Conn.

578
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:53,844
Yeah, Smith, get us
some black coffee

579
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:55,880
and tell Margie to come in here.

580
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,686
You look terrible.

581
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:02,853
What, you been drinking?

582
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:05,856
- This guy works
out of a speakeasy.

583
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:08,526
You want me to come off like
a Sunday school teacher?

584
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,929
- You're an agent of
the federal government.

585
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:13,297
You oughta follow the book.

586
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:16,033
- Yeah, well, I would
if there was a book

587
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:18,135
in this kind of operation.

588
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:21,806
You ever had an agent this
deep inside the rackets before?

589
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:24,208
- Your job is to uphold
the honor of the bureau.

590
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:29,113
- What the devil does that mean?

591
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:32,250
- You got a report?

592
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:35,386
(phone rings)

593
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:36,854
We got a corrupt sheriff.

594
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:40,658
Actually, the whole department's
on Diamond's payroll.

595
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:44,095
Hit some clubs, some
gambling, some prostitution.

596
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,997
He seems to run those
just for his own amusement

597
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:47,665
and not for profit.

598
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:48,933
- That's all nonsense.

599
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,134
It's the local sheriffs.

600
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:53,204
What about his bootlegging?

601
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:55,239
- It's bigger than we thought.

602
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:58,009
It's a major transportation
and distribution network.

603
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:02,046
He's even trying to set up an
offshore shipping operation.

604
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:05,349
For now he runs the
hooch down from Canada

605
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:07,118
through New York State by truck.

606
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,619
- We can't touch him offshore.

607
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:12,156
But when he crosses
the Canadian border,

608
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:15,159
that's a federal rap.

609
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:17,995
- He's getting hit pretty
hard by Dutch Schultz.

610
00:38:17,995 --> 00:38:19,430
- So?

611
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:22,133
- So I'm in the middle
of a mob war here.

612
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,968
These guys don't
really trust me.

613
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,536
I got their local
sheriffs staked out

614
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,305
in front of my
flophouse right now.

615
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,041
I'm hired on as a
soldier for now,

616
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:32,843
and the guy's buying
it right and left.

617
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:34,779
How far can I go to
protect my cover?

618
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:38,215
- Margie, will you excuse us?

619
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:47,525
You were an ace in
the Great War, right?

620
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:50,995
Patton Ring Squadron.

621
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:54,865
You were a hero, right?

622
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:57,435
- That was war.

623
00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:59,203
- Well, this is war too.

624
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:00,171
So they're killing each other,

625
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,340
it makes our job a lot easier.

626
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,175
When Mr. Hoover
authorizes an operation,

627
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:07,244
he wants results, and he
wants results quickly.

628
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:09,847
Now, I picked you because
you're rough around the edges.

629
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:12,883
And I expect that you
fit in beautifully

630
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:14,685
with all that vermin.

631
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,287
But if you screw up,

632
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:18,322
I'm gonna leave your
ass out there hanging.

633
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:23,828
Hey, cheer up.

634
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:24,662
It's the 30s.

635
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:30,468
Mr. Hoover wants company
men, not cowboys.

636
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:37,775
(lighthearted jazz music)

637
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:56,127
- Put that away!

638
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,798
- Yo, Bart, I'm gonna
go check this out.

639
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:04,235
- Hold on, what
have we got here?

640
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,403
A still.

641
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,771
Don't you know that's illegal?

642
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:08,773
- It's just a little moonshine.

643
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:09,874
Ain't no harm in that.

644
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:12,676
A man's got a right!

645
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:14,812
- Not in Jack Diamond's
neck of the woods.

646
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:17,748
You got no rights unless
we give them to you.

647
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:19,450
Legs doesn't want
any competition,

648
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:22,553
no matter how small
potatoes you are.

649
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:27,258
(mysterious music)

650
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:41,071
- Well, well, what
have we got here?

651
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:42,440
What are you gonna
do, shoot somebody?

652
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,508
- If you hurt my daddy, I was.

653
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:46,343
- Oh, he's your dad?

654
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:48,045
- Yes, now would
you get off of me?

655
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:53,784
Let go of me.

656
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:56,887
- You gotta promise
not to fight first.

657
00:40:58,088 --> 00:40:59,523
- Yeah, sure, I promise.

658
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:11,969
- You promised!

659
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:12,803
(woman chuckles)

660
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:13,637
- Did not.

661
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:18,375
- So you're gonna get
out of the shine business

662
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:19,810
if you know what's good for ya.

663
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,616
(bottles clanging)

664
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,862
- Well, I gotta go.

665
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:56,747
(lighthearted music)

666
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:03,220
(mysterious music)

667
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:15,933
(guns firing)

668
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:22,973
(men yelling)

669
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:37,955
- Go down there and
finish anybody left.

670
00:42:37,955 --> 00:42:39,223
Move!

671
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,959
And watch what Mr. Legs
Diamond sent us tonight.

672
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:44,395
- It's the full load, boss!

673
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,629
- Full load?

674
00:42:45,629 --> 00:42:46,997
You wouldn't lie
to me, would you?

675
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:47,831
- [Man] No!

676
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:49,333
- Oh my God.

677
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:50,601
What a grand night it is!

678
00:42:51,535 --> 00:42:53,137
Yeah.

679
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:55,372
He's gonna be pissed off.

680
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:57,908
But better to be pissed
off than pissed on.

681
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:01,879
Yeah, that son of a bitch.

682
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:05,282
- Let's go!

683
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:08,052
(dramatic music)

684
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:13,557
I want you to round up all
the people we got left.

685
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:17,861
Let's go hit the
bastard where it hurts.

686
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:19,463
- Boss, bad play.

687
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:22,900
We're spread too thin now.

688
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,234
We got guys all the
way up to Canada

689
00:43:24,234 --> 00:43:25,436
with that last shipment.

690
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,639
- I'm not just gonna
lay here and take this.

691
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:31,475
- I got a few tricks I
learned in the Great War.

692
00:43:31,475 --> 00:43:33,877
We'll hit him, hard.

693
00:43:33,877 --> 00:43:35,379
You and me.

694
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:37,881
(tense music)

695
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:48,292
- That's some trick, dynamite.

696
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,994
Dynamite, I know, from dynamite.

697
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:54,331
(tense music)

698
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:11,181
(dynamite explodes)

699
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:16,587
(Jack laughs)

700
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:27,865
(lighthearted music)

701
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:32,269
- You think she's
good looking, right?

702
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:33,804
- Who?

703
00:44:33,804 --> 00:44:35,939
- You know, Suzy from the farm.

704
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:37,775
- Yeah, kid, she's
a regular cupcake.

705
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,679
(tense music)

706
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:14,945
Max, can you make these guys?

707
00:45:14,945 --> 00:45:16,380
- Schultz's crew.

708
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,549
I could recognize
those yeggs anywhere.

709
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:20,851
Good eye, Bone.

710
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:22,119
Gave us the drop on them.

711
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:23,987
All right.

712
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:25,055
I'll split off to the right,

713
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:26,590
we'll hit 'em from two sides.

714
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:29,493
Wait for my signal,
and bang 'em hard.

715
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:33,797
(tense music)

716
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:43,273
(guns firing)

717
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:47,878
- Max is a little trigger happy.

718
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:48,812
Stay here.

719
00:45:48,812 --> 00:45:50,681
- No, no, no, I'll go with you.

720
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:52,649
- Stay here, I'll
take care of this.

721
00:45:54,885 --> 00:45:56,153
(gun fires)

722
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:58,655
(man yells)

723
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:01,125
(guns firing)

724
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:24,848
You little knucklehead,
what did I tell you?

725
00:46:24,848 --> 00:46:25,682
Come on!

726
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:30,487
(guns firing)

727
00:46:53,443 --> 00:46:58,148
- I'll go tell the boss
that pretty boy is here.

728
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:03,086
(romantic music)
(woman moans)

729
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:11,829
(knocking)

730
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:13,430
Boss.

731
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:14,631
- I'm busy!

732
00:47:14,631 --> 00:47:18,235
- Boss, Red is back with
Bone Conn, and Kiki.

733
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:20,871
- What?

734
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:22,372
What the hell is she doing here?

735
00:47:22,372 --> 00:47:23,507
- I don't know.

736
00:47:27,911 --> 00:47:28,745
- All right, bring 'em down,

737
00:47:28,745 --> 00:47:30,414
I'll be out in a minute.

738
00:47:31,548 --> 00:47:33,483
- Out in a minute?

739
00:47:33,483 --> 00:47:34,852
(woman moans)

740
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:35,686
Right.

741
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:49,233
- Why don't we just enjoy
the view for a second?

742
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:51,768
- Bone, honey, you going
a little daffy on me?

743
00:47:53,003 --> 00:47:54,571
When did you get so romantic?

744
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:56,340
- It must be the sea air.

745
00:47:57,608 --> 00:47:58,575
- The boss will see you now.

746
00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:12,089
- Hiya, Charlie.

747
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:21,331
(dramatic music)

748
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:25,102
- Kiki.

749
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:26,003
- [Kiki] Hi, Jack.

750
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,773
- So good to see you.

751
00:48:29,773 --> 00:48:32,342
- Yeah, well, I thought
I'd surprise you.

752
00:48:32,342 --> 00:48:33,176
- You did.

753
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:35,612
You certainly did.

754
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:40,550
Excuse us.

755
00:48:41,652 --> 00:48:43,153
I got some business
with the men.

756
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:46,823
- Yeah, I can see that.

757
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:47,658
Pig!

758
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:48,592
- Shut up!

759
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:53,497
- Jack, let go of me.

760
00:48:53,497 --> 00:48:55,599
- Don't raise your voice to me.

761
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:56,433
- Let me go.

762
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:03,140
(romantic music)

763
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:11,682
- Bone.

764
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:13,016
Good to see you.

765
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:16,320
You see what I
gotta put up with?

766
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:17,621
- Not a good thing, boss.

767
00:49:19,523 --> 00:49:20,357
- Yeah.

768
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:24,928
That was nice work
on that shipment.

769
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:27,364
See, Max?

770
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:28,832
You gotta keep your eyes open.

771
00:49:32,836 --> 00:49:34,037
What were you gonna show me?

772
00:49:43,847 --> 00:49:45,515
- Boss.

773
00:49:45,515 --> 00:49:46,917
Take a look at this.

774
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:48,885
This is the route
we've been running.

775
00:49:48,885 --> 00:49:52,222
We've lost 300 gallons of
whisky this month alone

776
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:53,991
to hijackers from Dutch.

777
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:55,192
Why are we doing it?

778
00:49:55,192 --> 00:49:56,593
- Because I'm giving
you safe passage

779
00:49:56,593 --> 00:49:58,795
through my county, that's why.

780
00:49:58,795 --> 00:50:02,466
- Your safe passage puts us
50 miles from Dutch's turf.

781
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:04,401
He's got us here,
here, and here.

782
00:50:04,401 --> 00:50:06,470
It's one road,
it's a bottleneck.

783
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:07,304
- So?

784
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:08,505
We put on more muscle.

785
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:10,107
Bang the bastard
into the next state.

786
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:12,109
- Not the smart play.

787
00:50:13,276 --> 00:50:15,312
Come down here to the
Oley Brothers territory.

788
00:50:15,312 --> 00:50:17,614
It's a straight shot
from Canada to Albany,

789
00:50:17,614 --> 00:50:19,316
down to the city.

790
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:21,618
Call it the Legs
Diamond Highway.

791
00:50:21,618 --> 00:50:22,986
What's standing in the way?

792
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:24,821
One hick sheriff.

793
00:50:24,821 --> 00:50:26,156
No offense, Red.

794
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:28,825
- [Jack] Christ, we can
buy him off for one tenth

795
00:50:28,825 --> 00:50:30,627
what we're paying Red.

796
00:50:30,627 --> 00:50:33,030
- Except the Oley Brothers
are with Schultz now.

797
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:36,900
- So maybe they ain't
so long for this world.

798
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:37,868
- Your plan leaves us weak,

799
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,970
it opens up the whole west side.

800
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:40,837
- Let him have it.

801
00:50:42,172 --> 00:50:44,641
While he's busy solidifying
his new territory

802
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:46,610
of useless farmland,

803
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:48,445
you get right into the city.

804
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:50,647
Let him think he's
won something.

805
00:50:50,647 --> 00:50:51,915
Christ, we can
even give him Red,

806
00:50:51,915 --> 00:50:54,084
we're not gonna
need him anymore.

807
00:50:54,084 --> 00:50:55,752
Lose a battle, win the war.

808
00:50:55,752 --> 00:50:58,255
- I ain't standing
for this shit!

809
00:50:58,255 --> 00:51:00,424
Who does this guy think he is

810
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:02,125
telling you what
to do, Mr. Diamond?

811
00:51:02,125 --> 00:51:03,026
- Shut up, Red.

812
00:51:05,262 --> 00:51:06,096
Shut up.

813
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:12,669
Bone.

814
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:16,673
Let's you and I take a walk.

815
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:25,082
Bone, I'm looking forward
to a great future with you.

816
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:26,216
I like what I'm seeing.

817
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:29,853
You're doing great
things for us.

818
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:31,288
- [Kiki] You're in the
wrong place, bitch!

819
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:32,255
Get out of here!

820
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:33,723
- Excuse me.

821
00:51:33,723 --> 00:51:36,793
Looks like I have a domestic
disturbance on my hands.

822
00:51:36,793 --> 00:51:37,861
That's all I need.

823
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:41,498
- Take your stuff
and get out of here!

824
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:44,601
I don't want you
anywhere near him!

825
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:46,603
Get out of here!

826
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:48,171
- What the hell's going on here?

827
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:49,139
Hey!

828
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:50,040
What the hell are you doing?

829
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,675
- Why don't you tell me?

830
00:51:51,675 --> 00:51:53,577
Seems like your
little whore's upset!

831
00:51:53,577 --> 00:51:55,946
- I am not a whore!

832
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,547
Jack, who is this person?

833
00:51:57,547 --> 00:51:58,882
- All right, shut up!

834
00:51:58,882 --> 00:51:59,683
Both of you!

835
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:03,954
All right, Blanche,
get out of here.

836
00:52:12,162 --> 00:52:13,897
This has got to stop.

837
00:52:17,367 --> 00:52:18,168
- I'll see.

838
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:21,538
Do you have to fuck
everything that moves?

839
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:26,710
- You have got some mouth.

840
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:28,278
I don't like that kind of talk!

841
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:32,849
- Well, I don't
like sharing you!

842
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:35,418
With Alice, every other
two-bit tramp in town.

843
00:52:35,418 --> 00:52:38,755
- Now don't you ever
talk about my wife!

844
00:52:39,756 --> 00:52:40,690
- Go ahead.

845
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:43,527
Hit me again, tough guy.

846
00:52:46,396 --> 00:52:48,598
(dramatic music)

847
00:52:48,598 --> 00:52:50,100
Get off me, pig!

848
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,268
Get off of me!

849
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:59,209
(intense saxophone music)

850
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,723
(romantic music)

851
00:53:13,723 --> 00:53:16,159
(Kiki moans)

852
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:42,385
(Kiki chuckles)

853
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,457
Aw, shit!

854
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:49,859
Shit!

855
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:50,694
- Yes!

856
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:53,964
(Kiki moans)

857
00:54:12,549 --> 00:54:15,485
(horses galloping)

858
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:26,830
(lighthearted jazz music)

859
00:54:32,302 --> 00:54:33,737
Come on, come on!

860
00:54:35,038 --> 00:54:36,940
Come on, you bums!

861
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,441
Come on, you bums!

862
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:43,647
(horses galloping)

863
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:47,784
Yes!

864
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:48,618
Yes, baby!

865
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:53,423
- You really know how
to pick 'em, boss.

866
00:54:53,423 --> 00:54:55,025
- Hey, that's got
nothing to do with it.

867
00:54:55,025 --> 00:54:57,727
You just gotta know which
jockeys you can pay to tank.

868
00:54:58,695 --> 00:55:00,096
Max.

869
00:55:00,096 --> 00:55:01,331
I want you to get Charlie,

870
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:03,466
go pick up my winnings,
I want you back here.

871
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:04,601
- Charlie.

872
00:55:04,601 --> 00:55:05,435
- Are we staying?

873
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:08,805
- Of course we're staying,

874
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:10,407
I got three more races fixed.

875
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,077
- You promised me you'd take me

876
00:55:14,077 --> 00:55:15,445
to the picture show today.

877
00:55:18,915 --> 00:55:21,484
- Ah, you're right doll, I did.

878
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:22,319
Can't go now.

879
00:55:27,857 --> 00:55:28,692
Hey.

880
00:55:29,693 --> 00:55:31,094
Come here.

881
00:55:31,094 --> 00:55:31,928
Huh?

882
00:55:33,396 --> 00:55:36,199
You really want to go to the
picture show that bad, huh?

883
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:37,434
Is that gonna make you happy?

884
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:38,868
You get to go to
the picture show?

885
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:42,272
All right.

886
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:43,606
Here, Bone.

887
00:55:43,606 --> 00:55:45,175
Take her to the show.

888
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:47,977
Take her shopping
afterwards, all right?

889
00:55:47,977 --> 00:55:49,245
You like that, right?

890
00:55:49,245 --> 00:55:50,613
Get some nice things
for yourself there.

891
00:55:51,581 --> 00:55:52,482
Whatever you want.

892
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:56,186
I'll see you at the club.

893
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:00,457
- Miss Kiki.

894
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:18,708
(lighthearted jazz music)

895
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:57,547
(dramatic music)

896
00:56:57,547 --> 00:57:00,784
- [Presenter] And now
the further adventures of

897
00:57:00,784 --> 00:57:03,052
Steel Doctor, Crime Fighter.

898
00:57:09,526 --> 00:57:14,264
In this chapter, a hero meets
his greatest challenge yet.

899
00:57:16,332 --> 00:57:18,334
The case of the lady from-

900
00:57:18,334 --> 00:57:19,602
- Are you crazy coming here?

901
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:21,070
- I had to see you.

902
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:22,539
I had to.

903
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:25,041
- Well, if my pa sees
you, he's gonna kill you.

904
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:27,277
Why don't you go
meet me in the barn?

905
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:28,111
Get goin'!

906
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:28,945
- Swell.

907
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:32,982
(mysterious music)

908
00:57:42,492 --> 00:57:44,994
(Suzy laughs)

909
00:57:46,563 --> 00:57:49,732
(romantic jazz music)

910
00:58:08,785 --> 00:58:11,454
(Suzy chuckles)

911
00:59:19,789 --> 00:59:22,859
(lighthearted music)

912
00:59:53,056 --> 00:59:54,190
- So if I'm hearing
you correctly,

913
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:55,625
that's a million
dollars a month, right?

914
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:56,626
(Jack chuckles)

915
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:57,927
Bone!

916
00:59:57,927 --> 00:59:59,395
Come on in.

917
00:59:59,395 --> 01:00:00,229
Thank you.

918
01:00:02,498 --> 01:00:03,333
Thank you.

919
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,034
Have a seat.

920
01:00:06,836 --> 01:00:08,037
Care for a cigar?

921
01:00:08,037 --> 01:00:08,871
- Certainly.

922
01:00:15,211 --> 01:00:17,947
- I'm telling you,
I love this country.

923
01:00:19,382 --> 01:00:21,651
You know, I started
off with nothing.

924
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:22,852
I was just a what,

925
01:00:22,852 --> 01:00:23,987
a punk kid down
the Lower East Side

926
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:25,355
that could outrun the cops.

927
01:00:26,222 --> 01:00:27,690
And so I got into the business.

928
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:29,959
What, I just jump on a
truck, grab what I could,

929
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:31,594
and bam, off like a light!

930
01:00:32,562 --> 01:00:34,297
And now look at me.

931
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:37,333
And I'm a young guy,
and look what I got.

932
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:40,269
- Only in America.

933
01:00:41,537 --> 01:00:44,707
- There's always
gonna be somebody

934
01:00:44,707 --> 01:00:46,509
who wants to take
that away from you.

935
01:00:48,344 --> 01:00:52,315
I got money, more women
than I can handle,

936
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:54,584
but what I don't got
is guys working for me

937
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:55,551
that got it on the ball.

938
01:00:55,551 --> 01:00:57,320
I need 10 more guys like me.

939
01:00:58,688 --> 01:00:59,489
- Boss.

940
01:01:00,923 --> 01:01:02,158
This is where I come in.

941
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:03,359
Make me your number two.

942
01:01:04,527 --> 01:01:06,095
Let me handle all
the bootlegging.

943
01:01:07,463 --> 01:01:08,731
It's gonna leave you
free to deal with Luciano

944
01:01:08,731 --> 01:01:10,667
and the bosses in the city.

945
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:13,569
Make peace with them, run
this like a corporation.

946
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:18,141
Forget about Schultz,
he's small-time.

947
01:01:18,141 --> 01:01:19,442
You'll bury him in a year.

948
01:01:22,745 --> 01:01:24,080
- This is music to my ears.

949
01:01:25,982 --> 01:01:29,652
Finally, finally, someone who
can grasp the big picture.

950
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,988
- Let me sweat the details.

951
01:01:33,122 --> 01:01:34,857
You'll be bigger
than all these bums.

952
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:37,694
- Okay.

953
01:01:38,761 --> 01:01:39,595
Okay.

954
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:43,266
We'll hit the Oley Brothers.

955
01:01:44,801 --> 01:01:45,702
You set it up.

956
01:01:48,137 --> 01:01:49,338
Then we'll see.

957
01:01:50,273 --> 01:01:51,808
- You got it, boss.

958
01:01:52,742 --> 01:01:55,478
(dramatic music)

959
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:30,279
- [Man] Okay, load
it in, bring it in.

960
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:34,350
(men chattering)

961
01:02:50,199 --> 01:02:53,136
(mysterious music)

962
01:02:57,206 --> 01:02:58,941
- [Man] We're 5
barrels short, boss.

963
01:02:58,941 --> 01:02:59,742
- What?

964
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:01,611
- Must've been lost on the road,

965
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:03,346
you know how it is.

966
01:03:03,346 --> 01:03:05,248
- Know how it is?

967
01:03:05,248 --> 01:03:06,649
Oh, how Irish.

968
01:03:06,649 --> 01:03:08,284
The bride at every wedding,

969
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:10,219
and the corpse at
every funeral, man.

970
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:14,991
I give him dames,
I give him jobs,

971
01:03:14,991 --> 01:03:16,826
and some guys have
even been stupid enough

972
01:03:16,826 --> 01:03:18,761
to spit in my face.

973
01:03:18,761 --> 01:03:23,099
But nobody steals
from Dutch Schultz.

974
01:03:23,099 --> 01:03:24,734
You will listen to me.

975
01:03:24,734 --> 01:03:26,435
- [Man] I can't give you
something I don't got.

976
01:03:26,435 --> 01:03:29,205
- We don't leave here until
I get what I paid for.

977
01:03:30,173 --> 01:03:31,174
You got that?

978
01:03:31,174 --> 01:03:32,108
- Fellas, come on.

979
01:03:32,108 --> 01:03:33,910
Can we talk about this?

980
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:36,045
- Take him down to the shed!

981
01:03:36,045 --> 01:03:38,548
(tense music)

982
01:03:48,191 --> 01:03:49,926
- What's the scoop?

983
01:03:49,926 --> 01:03:51,060
- Got them with
their pants down.

984
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:52,562
They got a full load of hooch.

985
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:54,997
Oh, by the way...

986
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:57,333
Our friend Dutch Schultz
is here, in the flesh.

987
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:58,734
- Dutch Schultz?

988
01:03:58,734 --> 01:03:59,869
Here?

989
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:01,304
- Yeah, he's supervising
the operation.

990
01:04:02,471 --> 01:04:03,739
Max, I'm gonna need you
to create a diversion.

991
01:04:03,739 --> 01:04:05,675
- Wait, wait, I gotta
think, I gotta think.

992
01:04:06,576 --> 01:04:07,777
Johnson, give me some grenades.

993
01:04:07,777 --> 01:04:08,945
Now, on the double!

994
01:04:10,246 --> 01:04:12,648
- We've got 'em right
where we want 'em.

995
01:04:12,648 --> 01:04:13,649
- And some dynamite.

996
01:04:16,652 --> 01:04:17,887
Mikey, get us outta here.

997
01:04:23,292 --> 01:04:25,895
(dramatic music)

998
01:04:25,895 --> 01:04:27,396
- Dirty rat bastard!

999
01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:28,664
What are you...

1000
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:31,767
Dutch!

1001
01:04:31,767 --> 01:04:34,270
I got a wife and two
kids, come on now.

1002
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:35,238
Please.

1003
01:04:35,238 --> 01:04:37,006
Have a heart.

1004
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:37,907
- Are you through?

1005
01:04:37,907 --> 01:04:39,275
- [Man] Please, Dutch.

1006
01:04:39,275 --> 01:04:40,543
- Hold his head.

1007
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:41,944
- [Man] Please.

1008
01:04:41,944 --> 01:04:44,347
(man groans)

1009
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:48,484
(Dutch grunts)

1010
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:55,925
- I think he got the message.

1011
01:05:02,198 --> 01:05:03,532
Let's go eat.

1012
01:05:03,532 --> 01:05:05,368
(men laughing)

1013
01:05:05,368 --> 01:05:07,870
(tense music)

1014
01:05:10,139 --> 01:05:12,808
(dynamite explodes)

1015
01:05:12,808 --> 01:05:14,543
(men yelling)

1016
01:05:14,543 --> 01:05:15,711
- Boss, it's Legs!

1017
01:05:15,711 --> 01:05:18,047
(gun fires)

1018
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:22,318
- They caught us with
our pants down, Bo.

1019
01:05:23,352 --> 01:05:24,687
Let's get the Thompsons.

1020
01:05:29,191 --> 01:05:31,594
(guns firing)

1021
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:33,229
- What's going on?

1022
01:05:33,229 --> 01:05:35,731
(guns firing)

1023
01:05:39,702 --> 01:05:41,037
- [Man] Come on!

1024
01:05:42,872 --> 01:05:45,942
(dynamite explodes)

1025
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:48,444
(men yelling)

1026
01:05:49,912 --> 01:05:52,048
- Move over there!

1027
01:05:52,048 --> 01:05:52,915
Come on!

1028
01:05:52,915 --> 01:05:55,418
(guns firing)

1029
01:06:02,091 --> 01:06:04,427
- [Man] Get those damn guns!

1030
01:06:05,661 --> 01:06:06,529
(dynamite explodes)

1031
01:06:06,529 --> 01:06:09,031
(guns firing)

1032
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:16,472
- Come on, move!

1033
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:17,773
- Gimme this.

1034
01:06:17,773 --> 01:06:18,607
After him!

1035
01:06:19,742 --> 01:06:21,811
(man yells)

1036
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:23,212
- [Man] Kill him!

1037
01:06:25,381 --> 01:06:26,949
(dynamite explodes)

1038
01:06:26,949 --> 01:06:29,452
(guns firing)

1039
01:06:54,243 --> 01:06:55,978
(grenade explodes)

1040
01:06:55,978 --> 01:06:58,481
(guns firing)

1041
01:07:05,287 --> 01:07:06,322
- They got Benny!

1042
01:07:06,322 --> 01:07:07,990
Come on, get outta here!

1043
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:10,493
(guns firing)

1044
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:23,406
(grenade explodes)

1045
01:07:23,406 --> 01:07:25,908
(man screams)

1046
01:07:41,424 --> 01:07:43,926
(tense music)

1047
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:55,404
(Jack chuckles)

1048
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:57,940
(phone rings)

1049
01:07:57,940 --> 01:07:58,941
- Diamond residence.

1050
01:07:59,975 --> 01:08:01,911
Yes, yes he is, one moment.

1051
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:03,479
Darling?

1052
01:08:03,479 --> 01:08:04,680
There's someone on
the phone for you.

1053
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:05,981
- Who is it, lovey?

1054
01:08:05,981 --> 01:08:07,416
- It's Charles Luciano.

1055
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:23,833
- Charlie.

1056
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:25,401
- Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack.

1057
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:26,368
Listen to me, Jack.

1058
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:30,039
I've already told Dutch
lay off the heavy stuff,

1059
01:08:30,039 --> 01:08:33,008
so now I'm telling you.

1060
01:08:33,008 --> 01:08:35,411
This thing between
the two of you,

1061
01:08:35,411 --> 01:08:36,479
not good, Jack.

1062
01:08:37,513 --> 01:08:39,715
- Yeah, so I'm
expanding a little bit.

1063
01:08:39,715 --> 01:08:42,718
This is America, I got a
right to do business here.

1064
01:08:42,718 --> 01:08:44,453
He's muscling in
on my territory,

1065
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:46,155
he's threatening my customers.

1066
01:08:47,022 --> 01:08:48,991
- That you took from him, Jack.

1067
01:08:48,991 --> 01:08:51,260
- Okay, all right.

1068
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:53,562
Charlie, I respect you.

1069
01:08:54,897 --> 01:08:58,667
- This is just business,
it's not personal.

1070
01:08:58,667 --> 01:09:02,204
You see that you separate
the two, all right?

1071
01:09:03,606 --> 01:09:06,876
(dramatic piano music)

1072
01:09:10,546 --> 01:09:13,382
- Those two aren't gonna
listen to reason, are they?

1073
01:09:13,382 --> 01:09:14,650
- Yeah.

1074
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:17,153
We need the cowboys for
a little while longer,

1075
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:20,489
but they're dinosaurs,

1076
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:23,359
this bang bang muscle stuff.

1077
01:09:24,793 --> 01:09:25,828
Almost extinct.

1078
01:09:27,229 --> 01:09:31,066
We're gonna run this
outfit like U.S. Steel,

1079
01:09:31,066 --> 01:09:36,071
and then those high hat
politicians, the hypocrites,

1080
01:09:37,773 --> 01:09:39,508
they won't be able to touch us.

1081
01:09:40,809 --> 01:09:42,278
- Yeah, I like that.

1082
01:09:45,814 --> 01:09:47,883
- Nobody messes with the outfit.

1083
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:52,655
So they'll come
around, or they won't.

1084
01:09:53,956 --> 01:09:57,193
(dramatic piano music)

1085
01:10:01,363 --> 01:10:02,765
- That was a brilliant idea.

1086
01:10:04,233 --> 01:10:05,467
Well, you know, Bone,

1087
01:10:05,467 --> 01:10:06,635
I got a genius for
an organization.

1088
01:10:07,603 --> 01:10:08,737
- You don't say?

1089
01:10:08,737 --> 01:10:10,272
- Yeah!

1090
01:10:10,272 --> 01:10:13,142
Our bootlegging rackets are a
regular money making machine.

1091
01:10:13,142 --> 01:10:14,476
They won't ever stop.

1092
01:10:14,476 --> 01:10:17,446
- What about our
friend, Mr. Schultz?

1093
01:10:18,948 --> 01:10:20,816
- He can throw a monkey
wrench into the machine,

1094
01:10:20,816 --> 01:10:21,684
this is true.

1095
01:10:23,018 --> 01:10:24,153
But I'll tough him out.

1096
01:10:25,187 --> 01:10:25,988
I'll beat him.

1097
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:29,491
Christ, back in the old days,

1098
01:10:29,491 --> 01:10:30,693
me and little Augie used to face

1099
01:10:30,693 --> 01:10:32,895
some real hard-nosed characters,

1100
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:34,463
a lot tougher than
that yid punk!

1101
01:10:34,463 --> 01:10:35,531
- That's right, Boss.

1102
01:10:41,804 --> 01:10:44,540
You know what my
real problem is?

1103
01:10:46,809 --> 01:10:47,610
Dames.

1104
01:10:48,644 --> 01:10:49,945
Dames.

1105
01:10:49,945 --> 01:10:52,047
Hey, women really
queer up my life.

1106
01:10:52,047 --> 01:10:55,451
You know, on one hand
I got Kiki, right?

1107
01:10:55,451 --> 01:10:56,819
I mean, Bone, you
know what I mean,

1108
01:10:56,819 --> 01:10:58,520
I don't gotta tell you.

1109
01:10:58,520 --> 01:10:59,388
A woman like that.

1110
01:11:00,389 --> 01:11:02,124
And then there's Alice.

1111
01:11:03,025 --> 01:11:05,160
Sweet little Alice.

1112
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:06,662
And God knows I love her,

1113
01:11:06,662 --> 01:11:08,831
she's made a real home for me,

1114
01:11:08,831 --> 01:11:10,466
and she would do
anything for me.

1115
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:13,269
But I tell you, the first twist

1116
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:15,404
that walks by me at the club,

1117
01:11:15,404 --> 01:11:16,939
and I'm off skirt chasing.

1118
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:19,108
I mean, I can't help it.

1119
01:11:20,175 --> 01:11:25,180
I never could.

1120
01:11:30,552 --> 01:11:33,122
(guns firing)

1121
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:35,958
(women screaming)

1122
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:44,033
(glass breaks)

1123
01:11:57,579 --> 01:11:59,081
Go grab a Thompson!

1124
01:11:59,081 --> 01:12:01,517
(guns firing)

1125
01:12:13,228 --> 01:12:14,063
- Get outta here!

1126
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:17,499
(guns firing)

1127
01:12:46,528 --> 01:12:49,465
(tires screeching)

1128
01:12:54,837 --> 01:12:57,573
(dramatic music)

1129
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:04,713
(women sobbing)

1130
01:13:13,522 --> 01:13:15,424
- Boss, you're hit.

1131
01:13:15,424 --> 01:13:16,992
- Yeah?

1132
01:13:16,992 --> 01:13:17,926
Ah, so what?

1133
01:13:17,926 --> 01:13:19,695
It's just buckshot, I'll live.

1134
01:13:19,695 --> 01:13:21,430
Maybe you haven't heard,

1135
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:24,233
they call me the Clay
Pigeon, I can't be killed.

1136
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:26,568
No one can kill Jack Diamond.

1137
01:13:27,870 --> 01:13:28,670
No one!

1138
01:13:30,172 --> 01:13:32,908
(dramatic music)

1139
01:13:46,989 --> 01:13:48,390
- Jesus Christ.

1140
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:51,727
This place looks like
a slaughterhouse.

1141
01:13:51,727 --> 01:13:52,561
- Yeah?

1142
01:13:52,561 --> 01:13:53,395
So clean it up.

1143
01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:59,334
- Jack, we've got
women, kids shot here.

1144
01:14:00,569 --> 01:14:02,371
I gotta get an ambulance.

1145
01:14:02,371 --> 01:14:03,605
You know, the state police

1146
01:14:03,605 --> 01:14:04,840
are gonna have to
come in on this.

1147
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,675
- Hey, flatfoot,
I'm bleeding here.

1148
01:14:06,675 --> 01:14:08,043
Can we discuss this later?

1149
01:14:09,778 --> 01:14:10,612
- Mr. Diamond.

1150
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:13,949
This is bad.

1151
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:16,285
This is real bad.

1152
01:14:18,687 --> 01:14:20,289
I can't cover for you on this.

1153
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:22,825
- God damn it, Red,
round up some hobos

1154
01:14:22,825 --> 01:14:25,794
and blame it on them,
do what you have to do!

1155
01:14:27,496 --> 01:14:28,330
Max.

1156
01:14:29,965 --> 01:14:31,200
Take me back to Alice.

1157
01:14:32,534 --> 01:14:34,369
She'll patch me up.

1158
01:14:34,369 --> 01:14:37,706
Bone, get over to Kiki's,
tell her I'm all right,

1159
01:14:38,874 --> 01:14:40,008
and then I want you
to get on the horn

1160
01:14:40,008 --> 01:14:41,243
to Charlie Luciano.

1161
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:45,380
This is getting out of hand.

1162
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:47,082
- You got it, boss.

1163
01:14:47,082 --> 01:14:49,852
(dramatic music)

1164
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:00,662
- Be a brave boy.

1165
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:02,731
There we go.

1166
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:09,905
- Sweetheart.

1167
01:15:09,905 --> 01:15:11,406
- What?

1168
01:15:11,406 --> 01:15:13,408
- You're the only person in
the world who understands me.

1169
01:15:13,408 --> 01:15:15,010
- Oh, honey, hush.

1170
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:16,645
Shh.

1171
01:15:16,645 --> 01:15:17,546
Mommy's here.

1172
01:15:18,714 --> 01:15:20,449
Mommy's here to
take care of you.

1173
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:25,187
(soft jazz music)

1174
01:15:47,476 --> 01:15:49,411
- Your mother never
teach you to knock?

1175
01:15:50,579 --> 01:15:52,314
- I've been looking
all over for you.

1176
01:15:53,615 --> 01:15:54,983
Figured you'd come here,

1177
01:15:54,983 --> 01:15:56,285
figured I'd let myself in.

1178
01:15:57,319 --> 01:15:58,453
- Oh, you did, did you?

1179
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:01,056
Why don't you tell
me what you want

1180
01:16:01,056 --> 01:16:03,225
before I throw you out?

1181
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:05,227
- Dutch Schultz tried
to hit us tonight.

1182
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:07,462
Legs got shot.

1183
01:16:09,731 --> 01:16:11,600
- Is he all right?

1184
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:12,701
- He's got thick skin.

1185
01:16:16,138 --> 01:16:16,972
- Where is he?

1186
01:16:17,839 --> 01:16:18,874
- Max drove him home.

1187
01:16:19,841 --> 01:16:21,209
You know, to his real home.

1188
01:16:22,377 --> 01:16:24,713
- Is that bitch Alice there?

1189
01:16:28,684 --> 01:16:29,518
That's it.

1190
01:16:30,552 --> 01:16:31,987
That's the last straw.

1191
01:16:34,623 --> 01:16:35,924
I'm through with that bum.

1192
01:16:40,128 --> 01:16:40,963
- Why tell me?

1193
01:16:44,066 --> 01:16:44,900
- See...

1194
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:51,940
I know you're up to something.

1195
01:16:53,942 --> 01:16:55,177
You're a cover.

1196
01:16:57,879 --> 01:16:58,981
And I'm thinking,

1197
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:03,018
maybe you and I could
work something together.

1198
01:17:05,554 --> 01:17:07,456
See, I know that
Legs is in trouble.

1199
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:11,627
And then I see a guy like you,

1200
01:17:14,763 --> 01:17:16,665
and I see he's got
something going on.

1201
01:17:19,801 --> 01:17:20,802
And I say to myself,

1202
01:17:22,704 --> 01:17:24,806
"Maybe we should
have a little talk."

1203
01:17:27,809 --> 01:17:28,644
See...

1204
01:17:32,447 --> 01:17:34,783
If we understand each other.

1205
01:17:40,555 --> 01:17:42,791
- [Bone] We
understand each other.

1206
01:17:42,791 --> 01:17:46,361
(romantic saxophone music)

1207
01:18:25,901 --> 01:18:27,669
- How are you gonna
stop the violence?

1208
01:18:27,669 --> 01:18:30,672
(reporters yelling)

1209
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:33,608
- My office is working
on the legal issue.

1210
01:18:33,608 --> 01:18:35,043
- [Reporter] Come on, Chief,
what's the lowdown here?

1211
01:18:35,043 --> 01:18:36,244
- We'll be making a
statement in the morning.

1212
01:18:36,244 --> 01:18:37,879
(reporters yelling)

1213
01:18:37,879 --> 01:18:38,914
- That's not good enough!

1214
01:18:38,914 --> 01:18:40,148
The people just want to know

1215
01:18:40,148 --> 01:18:41,383
that they can walk
down the street

1216
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:42,784
without some gangster
cutting them in half

1217
01:18:42,784 --> 01:18:43,819
with a Tommy gun.

1218
01:18:46,054 --> 01:18:48,623
- [Reporter] Come on, how
about a statement, Chief?

1219
01:18:48,623 --> 01:18:51,393
(dramatic music)

1220
01:18:57,299 --> 01:18:59,067
- All right boys, rough 'em out.

1221
01:19:00,102 --> 01:19:01,336
I want him here.

1222
01:19:01,336 --> 01:19:04,072
(dramatic music)

1223
01:19:28,497 --> 01:19:29,464
All right.

1224
01:19:29,464 --> 01:19:30,432
Let's go, Washburn.

1225
01:19:31,366 --> 01:19:32,200
- Why don't you let us be?

1226
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:34,102
We ain't harming no one.

1227
01:19:34,102 --> 01:19:35,670
- Yeah?

1228
01:19:35,804 --> 01:19:37,906
- How you doin', Frankie?

1229
01:19:46,882 --> 01:19:47,949
- Arthur.

1230
01:19:47,949 --> 01:19:48,984
- Lucky, Oley.

1231
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:51,453
Come on in.

1232
01:19:52,387 --> 01:19:53,455
What do you say?

1233
01:19:53,455 --> 01:19:55,223
- Hey, sit down, have a drink.

1234
01:19:55,223 --> 01:19:57,125
- I think you know
why we're all here.

1235
01:19:58,560 --> 01:19:59,795
- Give me a drink.

1236
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:00,896
- Oh, you know Arthur,

1237
01:20:02,030 --> 01:20:04,833
what you did was
very, very foolish.

1238
01:20:04,833 --> 01:20:07,502
- It was foolish and
it was unnecessary!

1239
01:20:08,637 --> 01:20:11,039
- Hey, wait a minute.

1240
01:20:14,776 --> 01:20:18,613
Legs Diamond has been
muscling in on my territory.

1241
01:20:21,316 --> 01:20:23,552
Territory that's
rightfully mine,

1242
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:24,953
given to me by you.

1243
01:20:25,921 --> 01:20:27,756
The guy drives me crazy.

1244
01:20:27,756 --> 01:20:30,158
(Lucky laughs)

1245
01:20:30,158 --> 01:20:32,727
- Oh, Dutch, listen,
you've got to calm down,

1246
01:20:32,727 --> 01:20:34,396
you're gonna give
yourself apoplexy

1247
01:20:34,396 --> 01:20:36,832
and then one of these mornings

1248
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:39,734
I'm liable to wake
up and find you dead.

1249
01:20:39,734 --> 01:20:41,670
- Hey, that Irish
potato eating mick

1250
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:43,505
is the one that's
gonna wind up dead.

1251
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:46,942
Oh, hey, sorry Oley,

1252
01:20:48,109 --> 01:20:50,011
to make the potato
reference, sir.

1253
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:51,880
- Come on, Dutch, so
what's the problem?

1254
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:53,381
You and he used to be pals,

1255
01:20:53,381 --> 01:20:54,316
you grew up together,

1256
01:20:54,316 --> 01:20:55,817
this war has got to stop.

1257
01:20:55,817 --> 01:20:56,751
- Oh, come on.

1258
01:20:56,751 --> 01:20:57,686
He was never a pal of mine,

1259
01:20:57,686 --> 01:20:59,321
that silky pant son of a bitch.

1260
01:20:59,321 --> 01:21:02,924
- This is bad for business,
everybody's business!

1261
01:21:02,924 --> 01:21:04,593
- Very, very bad, Arthur.

1262
01:21:04,593 --> 01:21:05,861
Now you listen to me,

1263
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:08,263
I want to explain
something to you.

1264
01:21:09,664 --> 01:21:12,400
We can not afford to
be calling attention

1265
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,636
to our bootlegging operations.

1266
01:21:17,038 --> 01:21:19,975
This outfit has got to be...

1267
01:21:21,776 --> 01:21:22,978
Invisible.

1268
01:21:24,212 --> 01:21:27,249
You start blasting kids
and women on the street,

1269
01:21:27,249 --> 01:21:32,153
and then the cops and the
wasp political leaders,

1270
01:21:33,288 --> 01:21:35,957
they've just got to take
some kind of action.

1271
01:21:35,957 --> 01:21:37,359
- Ah, well, look.

1272
01:21:37,359 --> 01:21:39,694
Just pay them off as
usual, those shyster fucks.

1273
01:21:39,694 --> 01:21:43,031
- No amount of money will
buy them off this time.

1274
01:21:43,031 --> 01:21:44,266
- No?

1275
01:21:44,266 --> 01:21:45,800
- This ain't like
the old days, Dutch.

1276
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:47,903
- No, no, no, he's right.

1277
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:49,304
Besides that,
we're liable to get

1278
01:21:49,304 --> 01:21:51,206
the feds sniffing around us,

1279
01:21:51,206 --> 01:21:53,675
and then that's really bad news.

1280
01:21:53,675 --> 01:21:56,111
This is a whole
different breed, Arthur.

1281
01:21:57,112 --> 01:21:58,146
- Do you believe this shit?

1282
01:21:59,347 --> 01:22:00,982
You know, it used to be
when a guy wronged you,

1283
01:22:00,982 --> 01:22:03,018
you can settle a score.

1284
01:22:03,018 --> 01:22:03,919
You know what I mean?

1285
01:22:03,919 --> 01:22:05,053
Now what do I gotta do?

1286
01:22:06,221 --> 01:22:07,489
You know, roll over
and piss up in the air

1287
01:22:07,489 --> 01:22:09,291
and come before the
board of directors?

1288
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:12,327
All right, all right.

1289
01:22:14,362 --> 01:22:17,699
But anything that moves
across my territory is mine.

1290
01:22:17,699 --> 01:22:19,100
And this is how I keep it...

1291
01:22:21,136 --> 01:22:22,671
I don't lay down for nobody!

1292
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:25,440
Get my coat.

1293
01:22:27,075 --> 01:22:28,143
Son of a bitch.

1294
01:22:29,177 --> 01:22:31,846
(dramatic music)

1295
01:22:36,985 --> 01:22:38,386
- Read about it in the log.

1296
01:22:39,321 --> 01:22:40,188
- Bone Conn, sir.

1297
01:22:44,826 --> 01:22:46,628
- It's about time, Conn.

1298
01:22:46,628 --> 01:22:48,196
You know, I oughta
can you right now.

1299
01:22:48,196 --> 01:22:49,397
Hey, no smoking.

1300
01:22:50,799 --> 01:22:53,168
Look, I don't think you realize
what's going on here, okay?

1301
01:22:53,168 --> 01:22:54,602
This is all the
paperwork that Hoover

1302
01:22:54,602 --> 01:22:56,972
is making me submit to the
committee about this operation.

1303
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:59,874
Well, I have no information
about this operation.

1304
01:22:59,874 --> 01:23:00,942
- You want paperwork?

1305
01:23:05,547 --> 01:23:07,349
- What is this,
some sort of a joke?

1306
01:23:08,249 --> 01:23:09,517
- No.

1307
01:23:09,517 --> 01:23:11,920
It's a map of Leg's
shipping route.

1308
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:14,022
That's all I had to write on.

1309
01:23:14,022 --> 01:23:16,858
He's got a warehouse in
Canada full to the gills.

1310
01:23:18,927 --> 01:23:21,730
These are details of
the port of crossings.

1311
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:25,200
You could nail the whole
convoy right there.

1312
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:27,969
Set up a roadblock, I'll
lead him right to ya.

1313
01:23:32,073 --> 01:23:34,776
(chuckling)

1314
01:23:34,776 --> 01:23:36,077
- You are now my idol.

1315
01:23:41,716 --> 01:23:42,851
- Stop the car.

1316
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:43,952
- What, what?

1317
01:23:43,952 --> 01:23:44,786
- Stop the car!

1318
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:50,191
- What's the matter?

1319
01:23:50,191 --> 01:23:52,494
- Why is that hick farmer
still in business here?

1320
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:54,696
- What's wrong?

1321
01:23:55,864 --> 01:23:57,399
- Am I the only one
upset about this?

1322
01:23:57,399 --> 01:23:59,901
I'm killing myself trying
to control this territory,

1323
01:23:59,901 --> 01:24:02,604
these yokels are undercutting
me right under my nose!

1324
01:24:02,604 --> 01:24:04,039
- [Max] Yeah, that ain't right.

1325
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:06,107
- Jimmy, go out and
burn this guy down!

1326
01:24:06,107 --> 01:24:07,976
- Boss, we gotta get goin'.

1327
01:24:09,544 --> 01:24:10,578
- Yeah, you're right.

1328
01:24:11,746 --> 01:24:13,648
Just shoot him, that's better.

1329
01:24:14,783 --> 01:24:15,717
Go on!

1330
01:24:15,717 --> 01:24:16,918
We'll see you back in town.

1331
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:20,488
- Yeah, okay boss.

1332
01:24:20,488 --> 01:24:23,258
(dramatic music)

1333
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:19,180
(woman chuckles)

1334
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:20,648
- Today's gambling receipts.

1335
01:25:21,783 --> 01:25:24,119
Oh, so I'll take them
up to the office?

1336
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:25,053
You gotta lock up.

1337
01:25:27,088 --> 01:25:27,922
- Hey, Bone.

1338
01:25:29,257 --> 01:25:30,859
I gotta speak to
you, right away.

1339
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:33,828
- Girls, take a powder.

1340
01:25:37,465 --> 01:25:38,299
Bud.

1341
01:25:41,803 --> 01:25:44,806
- We were driving
outside of town.

1342
01:25:44,806 --> 01:25:48,510
Legs, he sees the moonshine,
and he went crazy.

1343
01:25:54,916 --> 01:25:55,850
- He is crazy.

1344
01:25:57,252 --> 01:26:00,688
He sees that guy's very
existence as a slap in the face.

1345
01:26:00,688 --> 01:26:05,126
- Yeah, right, but he
ordered me to kill him.

1346
01:26:11,399 --> 01:26:12,233
I didn't.

1347
01:26:14,469 --> 01:26:16,171
I mean, I couldn't.

1348
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:18,206
Look, I know Legs is gonna
be really steamed, but-

1349
01:26:18,206 --> 01:26:19,974
- No, he's gonna kill you.

1350
01:26:25,313 --> 01:26:26,648
- I'm not cut out for this.

1351
01:26:28,349 --> 01:26:29,184
Not like you.

1352
01:26:31,819 --> 01:26:34,756
I'm gonna go away with Suzy.

1353
01:26:35,957 --> 01:26:37,525
You know, take her
out of this mess.

1354
01:26:41,429 --> 01:26:42,263
I love her, Bone.

1355
01:26:45,333 --> 01:26:46,534
- All right.

1356
01:26:46,534 --> 01:26:49,837
I'll square it with
Legs tomorrow, somehow.

1357
01:26:52,407 --> 01:26:53,841
- Thanks, Bone.

1358
01:26:53,841 --> 01:26:54,676
I mean...

1359
01:26:56,544 --> 01:26:57,378
Thanks.

1360
01:27:05,987 --> 01:27:09,090
How do you do it?

1361
01:27:09,090 --> 01:27:09,891
- Do what?

1362
01:27:10,858 --> 01:27:12,694
- The killing.

1363
01:27:12,694 --> 01:27:15,430
(dramatic music)

1364
01:27:44,225 --> 01:27:46,461
- This place is such a dump.

1365
01:27:46,461 --> 01:27:47,962
- Didn't stop you from coming.

1366
01:27:49,464 --> 01:27:50,565
- Yeah, well I didn't tell you

1367
01:27:50,565 --> 01:27:52,667
you could plan it either.

1368
01:28:20,261 --> 01:28:22,864
- What'd you bring,
a whore up here?

1369
01:28:22,864 --> 01:28:25,099
- What other kind of
girl would come up here?

1370
01:28:32,173 --> 01:28:34,909
(dramatic music)

1371
01:28:36,044 --> 01:28:38,379
- You know the drill, let's go.

1372
01:28:38,379 --> 01:28:39,714
- Get your clothes!

1373
01:28:48,189 --> 01:28:50,124
- Throw him in a river.

1374
01:28:50,992 --> 01:28:53,761
(dramatic music)

1375
01:29:02,537 --> 01:29:04,672
- Bone, we got an
old friend of yours.

1376
01:29:04,672 --> 01:29:05,707
Get in.

1377
01:29:05,707 --> 01:29:07,241
- [Bone] Where you takin' me?

1378
01:29:07,241 --> 01:29:08,343
- For a ride.

1379
01:29:41,142 --> 01:29:43,878
(dramatic music)

1380
01:29:47,281 --> 01:29:48,850
- You recognize this guy, Bone?

1381
01:29:50,251 --> 01:29:52,920
O'Brien confessed to me
that you went soft on a hit.

1382
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:54,155
And I ask myself,

1383
01:29:54,155 --> 01:29:56,758
"What kind of a mug
doesn't pop a mark

1384
01:29:56,758 --> 01:29:57,892
when he's supposed to?"

1385
01:29:59,427 --> 01:30:01,295
There's only two
possibilities, boys.

1386
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:04,665
Yellow or a cop.

1387
01:30:04,665 --> 01:30:05,566
- Thank you.

1388
01:30:05,566 --> 01:30:06,501
Which is it?

1389
01:30:06,501 --> 01:30:08,369
- I don't accept the choices.

1390
01:30:09,570 --> 01:30:10,772
- You got moxie.

1391
01:30:10,772 --> 01:30:11,839
He's going for a ride.

1392
01:30:14,509 --> 01:30:17,245
(dramatic music)

1393
01:30:23,117 --> 01:30:24,552
- How many more
barrels do we got left?

1394
01:30:24,552 --> 01:30:25,820
- Ah, four or five hundred.

1395
01:30:25,820 --> 01:30:26,654
- Well, let's get them
loaded on the truck

1396
01:30:26,654 --> 01:30:27,655
so I don't got all day.

1397
01:30:27,655 --> 01:30:29,457
- Come on, a little faster, eh?

1398
01:30:29,457 --> 01:30:30,691
- [Jack] Where the hell is Bone?

1399
01:30:30,691 --> 01:30:33,127
- [Max] I don't know,
he hasn't shown up yet.

1400
01:30:33,127 --> 01:30:34,328
- [Jack] Of all the
days to show up late,

1401
01:30:34,328 --> 01:30:36,297
I gotta get these
barrels of hooch loaded!

1402
01:30:36,297 --> 01:30:37,331
- [Max] We're working on it!

1403
01:30:37,331 --> 01:30:38,933
- Work on it better, all right?

1404
01:30:40,968 --> 01:30:43,438
I want these barrels
on the truck now!

1405
01:30:43,438 --> 01:30:44,672
- Jack, I'm moving
them as fast I can,

1406
01:30:44,672 --> 01:30:45,506
we're a little shorthanded-

1407
01:30:45,506 --> 01:30:46,340
- Legs, Legs!

1408
01:30:49,310 --> 01:30:50,711
- What the hell
are you doing here?

1409
01:30:50,711 --> 01:30:53,214
We're not loading matzah
balls here, Dutch.

1410
01:30:53,214 --> 01:30:54,582
- I come to evict yas.

1411
01:30:56,250 --> 01:30:57,518
- Came to evict us?

1412
01:30:57,518 --> 01:30:58,753
What are you, a comedian?

1413
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:00,721
(Dutch chuckles)

1414
01:31:00,721 --> 01:31:02,290
- Come here.

1415
01:31:02,290 --> 01:31:04,025
I got something better for you.

1416
01:31:04,025 --> 01:31:05,660
Max, what's O'Brien doing alive?

1417
01:31:08,996 --> 01:31:10,198
- I guess you
didn't expect to see

1418
01:31:10,198 --> 01:31:11,699
this piece of shit
again, did ya?

1419
01:31:11,699 --> 01:31:12,934
- No, actually I didn't.

1420
01:31:14,068 --> 01:31:14,902
- Yeah?

1421
01:31:16,404 --> 01:31:17,238
- [Jack] Bone, what's going on?

1422
01:31:17,238 --> 01:31:18,272
Why didn't you kill him?

1423
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:21,909
- Looks like you got
a cop on your hands.

1424
01:31:23,110 --> 01:31:24,612
- You got another
dick in your pocket?

1425
01:31:24,612 --> 01:31:26,948
- I knew there was something
funny about this guy.

1426
01:31:26,948 --> 01:31:27,815
- Funny?

1427
01:31:27,815 --> 01:31:29,450
Nah.

1428
01:31:29,450 --> 01:31:30,751
This guy's a God damn G-man.

1429
01:31:31,686 --> 01:31:33,187
- Bone, what the hell is this?

1430
01:31:35,456 --> 01:31:37,124
What the hell is this?

1431
01:31:38,526 --> 01:31:40,027
String him up!

1432
01:31:40,027 --> 01:31:40,962
String him up!

1433
01:31:43,030 --> 01:31:44,899
How could you do this?

1434
01:31:44,899 --> 01:31:46,033
I gave you everything!

1435
01:31:46,033 --> 01:31:47,068
I trusted you!

1436
01:31:47,969 --> 01:31:48,803
- Come here, you.

1437
01:31:48,803 --> 01:31:50,171
- Yes!

1438
01:31:50,171 --> 01:31:52,540
My boys found him
skulking around

1439
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:54,408
that rotten singer's apartment.

1440
01:31:55,309 --> 01:31:56,644
Yeah.

1441
01:31:56,644 --> 01:31:59,013
He's got the smell
of cheap perfume

1442
01:31:59,013 --> 01:31:59,947
and pussy on him.

1443
01:31:59,947 --> 01:32:01,716
- Damn it, you son of a bitch!

1444
01:32:01,716 --> 01:32:03,417
- Don't beat on your relatives.

1445
01:32:03,417 --> 01:32:04,952
You've both be
schtupping the same girl.

1446
01:32:04,952 --> 01:32:07,021
- You son of a bitch.

1447
01:32:07,021 --> 01:32:07,989
Jesus, Bone.

1448
01:32:07,989 --> 01:32:10,324
You and Kiki behind my back.

1449
01:32:10,324 --> 01:32:13,060
- I guess you hire
guys that like to fuck,

1450
01:32:13,060 --> 01:32:15,096
but they don't like to kill.

1451
01:32:15,096 --> 01:32:17,365
Guess you don't got the
balls for it anymore.

1452
01:32:17,365 --> 01:32:18,633
The killing, I mean.

1453
01:32:18,633 --> 01:32:19,667
- What, you think I
don't got the balls?

1454
01:32:19,667 --> 01:32:20,501
- I don't know.

1455
01:32:22,637 --> 01:32:24,939
- Hey, Jimmy boy, come
here for a minute, will ya?

1456
01:32:24,939 --> 01:32:26,240
Come here!

1457
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:27,508
- [Dutch] I don't
need a newspaper.

1458
01:32:27,508 --> 01:32:29,810
- He's another kid who
didn't listen to me.

1459
01:32:29,810 --> 01:32:30,578
You...

1460
01:32:32,980 --> 01:32:33,814
- Oh, hey.

1461
01:32:35,149 --> 01:32:36,951
You want me to do it for you?

1462
01:32:36,951 --> 01:32:37,785
Here.

1463
01:32:46,794 --> 01:32:49,130
(gun fires)

1464
01:32:57,305 --> 01:32:58,539
There's one less Irish pick.

1465
01:32:58,539 --> 01:32:59,974
- All right, you must've
tipped off the feds,

1466
01:32:59,974 --> 01:33:01,676
they're gonna be all
over our trucking routes.

1467
01:33:01,676 --> 01:33:04,812
Get these off the trucks,
loaded on the ship, now!

1468
01:33:04,812 --> 01:33:06,847
Now, now, come on!

1469
01:33:06,847 --> 01:33:08,149
- Hey, Legs!

1470
01:33:08,149 --> 01:33:09,617
You're running out of gunsels.

1471
01:33:09,617 --> 01:33:11,319
- I'm running out of
patience with you.

1472
01:33:11,319 --> 01:33:12,820
- The offshore is mine!

1473
01:33:12,820 --> 01:33:14,555
- Well, I'm sorry about that.

1474
01:33:14,555 --> 01:33:15,723
- Oh, no.

1475
01:33:15,723 --> 01:33:16,557
Hey.

1476
01:33:17,658 --> 01:33:19,260
You're welching on the deal.

1477
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:21,629
- What are you, threatening me?

1478
01:33:21,629 --> 01:33:23,364
- Luciano's agreement doesn't-

1479
01:33:23,364 --> 01:33:25,399
- Are you threatening me?

1480
01:33:25,399 --> 01:33:26,734
- Am I threatening you?

1481
01:33:26,734 --> 01:33:27,568
- [Jack] Yeah.

1482
01:33:30,171 --> 01:33:32,106
- You got the memory
of a cockroach.

1483
01:33:35,009 --> 01:33:36,911
(dramatic music)

1484
01:33:36,911 --> 01:33:40,281
- Get the hell outta
here, you punks.

1485
01:33:40,281 --> 01:33:42,116
Fuckin' cowards.

1486
01:33:42,116 --> 01:33:42,950
Go on!

1487
01:33:45,586 --> 01:33:46,587
- Give me the gun.

1488
01:33:46,587 --> 01:33:47,722
Thanks, baby.

1489
01:33:47,722 --> 01:33:48,889
Come here.

1490
01:33:48,889 --> 01:33:51,392
(tense music)

1491
01:34:00,368 --> 01:34:02,870
(guns firing)

1492
01:34:09,877 --> 01:34:12,380
- Where the hell's
that son of a bitch?

1493
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:14,882
(guns firing)

1494
01:34:17,451 --> 01:34:18,986
- Forget about Dutch, boss.

1495
01:34:18,986 --> 01:34:20,821
We got the feds to
worry about now.

1496
01:34:20,821 --> 01:34:21,756
Let's get you out of here,

1497
01:34:21,756 --> 01:34:22,757
there's too much booze around.

1498
01:34:22,757 --> 01:34:24,392
They can put us away for good.

1499
01:34:24,392 --> 01:34:26,894
(guns firing)

1500
01:34:30,931 --> 01:34:32,833
- That Jew is gonna
bring us all down.

1501
01:34:36,370 --> 01:34:37,972
We better get to the docks.

1502
01:34:37,972 --> 01:34:40,474
(guns firing)

1503
01:34:46,647 --> 01:34:48,315
But I'm not leaving two
million dollars worth of hooch

1504
01:34:48,315 --> 01:34:49,216
for Dutch to find.

1505
01:34:50,551 --> 01:34:51,786
Come on, boys, get going.

1506
01:34:52,820 --> 01:34:55,322
(guns firing)

1507
01:34:59,827 --> 01:35:02,463
Max, you get to the dock,
make sure we get away safe,

1508
01:35:04,098 --> 01:35:04,999
find Charlie.

1509
01:35:06,434 --> 01:35:08,235
Make him kill this
piece of garbage.

1510
01:35:10,705 --> 01:35:12,006
Have him send him to hell,

1511
01:35:13,074 --> 01:35:14,842
but make it slow, huh?

1512
01:35:14,842 --> 01:35:17,311
(guns firing)

1513
01:35:17,311 --> 01:35:18,813
Come on, let's go!

1514
01:35:19,914 --> 01:35:21,315
- You see any Irish prick?

1515
01:35:22,717 --> 01:35:25,419
You can't run forever,
this ain't over!

1516
01:35:28,522 --> 01:35:29,457
- Where's Conn?

1517
01:35:29,457 --> 01:35:30,558
- He hasn't checked in yet, sir.

1518
01:35:30,558 --> 01:35:31,492
- Ah, the hell with him.

1519
01:35:31,492 --> 01:35:32,426
We'll proceed as planned.

1520
01:35:32,426 --> 01:35:34,462
All right, men, move out!

1521
01:35:58,052 --> 01:36:00,321
- Aren't you gonna
beg now, tough guy?

1522
01:36:00,321 --> 01:36:01,889
- Cut the small
talk, cheese-head,

1523
01:36:01,889 --> 01:36:03,324
just get it over with.

1524
01:36:07,728 --> 01:36:09,463
- What makes you so tough?

1525
01:36:09,463 --> 01:36:10,631
- Just comes natural.

1526
01:36:14,769 --> 01:36:17,638
(gun fires)

1527
01:36:17,638 --> 01:36:20,374
(dramatic music)

1528
01:36:24,011 --> 01:36:25,246
- What's the matter, tough guy?

1529
01:36:25,246 --> 01:36:26,881
Got no wise aleck
comment for me?

1530
01:36:29,016 --> 01:36:31,185
- Give me a minute,
I'll think of one.

1531
01:36:31,185 --> 01:36:34,288
(lighthearted music)

1532
01:36:53,774 --> 01:36:56,544
(dramatic music)

1533
01:37:17,031 --> 01:37:20,201
- You mind telling
me what's going on?

1534
01:37:26,774 --> 01:37:29,610
(propeller spins)

1535
01:37:34,081 --> 01:37:36,851
(dramatic music)

1536
01:37:43,190 --> 01:37:45,526
(gun fires)

1537
01:38:15,656 --> 01:38:17,024
- Son of a bitch!

1538
01:38:18,325 --> 01:38:19,894
What am I gonna tell the boss?

1539
01:38:19,894 --> 01:38:20,694
- Max.

1540
01:38:20,694 --> 01:38:21,629
- What?

1541
01:38:21,629 --> 01:38:22,763
- Max, he's turning around.

1542
01:38:22,763 --> 01:38:23,764
- Huh?

1543
01:38:23,764 --> 01:38:25,266
- I think he's coming back.

1544
01:38:25,266 --> 01:38:27,401
- What the hell's
that guy up to?

1545
01:38:27,401 --> 01:38:28,569
Duck outta here, Gus.

1546
01:38:28,569 --> 01:38:30,137
I'll reload.

1547
01:38:30,137 --> 01:38:32,840
(dramatic music)

1548
01:38:51,058 --> 01:38:53,560
(guns firing)

1549
01:39:25,592 --> 01:39:28,495
(grenade explodes)

1550
01:40:00,461 --> 01:40:01,528
- Well, well.

1551
01:40:02,830 --> 01:40:04,531
If it ain't the boxer.

1552
01:40:04,531 --> 01:40:06,734
Always wondered what
happened to you.

1553
01:40:06,734 --> 01:40:09,036
Heard rumors you was
working for Legs Diamond.

1554
01:40:10,204 --> 01:40:11,505
- I work for the law.

1555
01:40:14,942 --> 01:40:15,743
- What?

1556
01:40:17,444 --> 01:40:18,245
A copper?

1557
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:24,852
A stinkin' copper?

1558
01:40:26,286 --> 01:40:28,789
I thought we had
something going.

1559
01:40:28,789 --> 01:40:29,957
- We do.

1560
01:40:29,957 --> 01:40:31,125
What's changed?

1561
01:40:32,059 --> 01:40:33,160
- Everything.

1562
01:40:34,395 --> 01:40:36,530
How can I have
fallen for a copper?

1563
01:40:39,433 --> 01:40:40,901
- Kiki.

1564
01:40:40,901 --> 01:40:41,802
I need your help.

1565
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:45,172
- Why should I help you?

1566
01:40:46,607 --> 01:40:47,441
I hate you.

1567
01:40:54,381 --> 01:40:55,215
- Huh.

1568
01:40:56,784 --> 01:40:59,019
Law ain't no friend of ours.

1569
01:40:59,019 --> 01:41:02,890
- You fellas are facing
the chair for a murder rap.

1570
01:41:02,890 --> 01:41:05,325
- We didn't do
nothing, it's a fix.

1571
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:08,462
- Yeah, well don't I know it.

1572
01:41:08,462 --> 01:41:09,797
I'll spring you.

1573
01:41:09,797 --> 01:41:11,432
I'll give you a chance
to set it straight

1574
01:41:11,432 --> 01:41:13,400
with a federal judge,

1575
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:16,036
a judge that ain't
on Diamond's payroll.

1576
01:41:16,036 --> 01:41:17,604
But you got to help me first.

1577
01:41:22,543 --> 01:41:25,212
- Sounds to me like
we got ourselves

1578
01:41:25,212 --> 01:41:27,214
a new marshal in town.

1579
01:41:27,214 --> 01:41:29,783
- That's right, and
I need some deputies.

1580
01:41:35,055 --> 01:41:37,791
(dramatic music)

1581
01:42:11,425 --> 01:42:14,428
(suspenseful music)

1582
01:42:44,625 --> 01:42:46,360
- Hey, you guys wake up!

1583
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:47,828
Shoot him!

1584
01:42:47,828 --> 01:42:50,330
(guns firing)

1585
01:42:55,369 --> 01:42:57,738
Give me a Thompson, God damn it!

1586
01:42:57,738 --> 01:42:58,639
Turn it up!

1587
01:43:02,242 --> 01:43:04,745
(guns firing)

1588
01:43:25,699 --> 01:43:28,302
(men groaning)

1589
01:43:53,327 --> 01:43:54,161
- Hey!

1590
01:43:55,696 --> 01:43:57,531
You with the Dutchman?

1591
01:43:57,531 --> 01:43:58,365
Huh?

1592
01:44:01,101 --> 01:44:02,970
Hey, listen, I'm
not with these guys.

1593
01:44:06,773 --> 01:44:07,608
Come on!

1594
01:44:09,376 --> 01:44:10,944
We can make a deal.

1595
01:44:11,845 --> 01:44:14,781
(mysterious music)

1596
01:44:29,496 --> 01:44:30,297
Listen!

1597
01:44:32,266 --> 01:44:33,200
You can't kill me.

1598
01:44:35,636 --> 01:44:36,470
I'm a law!

1599
01:44:39,172 --> 01:44:40,007
Really!

1600
01:44:41,275 --> 01:44:42,609
I'm a cop, I can help ya.

1601
01:44:44,077 --> 01:44:46,413
(gun fires)

1602
01:45:02,696 --> 01:45:04,331
You!

1603
01:45:04,331 --> 01:45:06,433
You dumb, stupid nigger.

1604
01:45:07,567 --> 01:45:08,502
I should've...

1605
01:45:08,502 --> 01:45:10,837
(gun fires)

1606
01:45:21,848 --> 01:45:24,951
(lighthearted music)

1607
01:45:38,298 --> 01:45:39,966
- Lose the Thompson.

1608
01:45:41,702 --> 01:45:43,403
I'm gonna kill you!

1609
01:45:43,403 --> 01:45:45,639
Never thought you'd make
it this far, copper.

1610
01:45:47,107 --> 01:45:49,142
But now it's lights out time.

1611
01:45:50,344 --> 01:45:52,779
I'm gonna blow your head off.

1612
01:45:55,449 --> 01:45:56,283
Damn it!

1613
01:45:58,752 --> 01:46:00,087
Stinkin' copper!

1614
01:46:01,688 --> 01:46:03,190
You're dead!

1615
01:46:03,190 --> 01:46:05,926
(dramatic music)

1616
01:46:19,339 --> 01:46:21,842
(Jack groans)

1617
01:46:58,912 --> 01:47:00,580
Where are you taking me, G-man?

1618
01:47:01,415 --> 01:47:02,416
- Where do you think?

1619
01:47:02,416 --> 01:47:04,484
Albany County Jail.

1620
01:47:04,484 --> 01:47:05,685
- Ha!

1621
01:47:05,685 --> 01:47:06,920
And how long do you think

1622
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:08,422
they're gonna keep
me in there for?

1623
01:47:08,422 --> 01:47:09,689
Not long at all.

1624
01:47:09,689 --> 01:47:12,025
See, I got me the best
lawyers money can buy.

1625
01:47:12,959 --> 01:47:14,127
How much do you make a year,

1626
01:47:14,127 --> 01:47:16,263
you lousy, stinkin',
civil servant.

1627
01:47:16,263 --> 01:47:19,199
What, two, three
thousand dollars a year?

1628
01:47:19,199 --> 01:47:22,669
I built an empire worth
10 million dollars!

1629
01:47:22,669 --> 01:47:23,970
You can't keep me in jail,

1630
01:47:24,938 --> 01:47:25,906
and on what charges?

1631
01:47:25,906 --> 01:47:28,175
I wasn't doing anything illegal.

1632
01:47:28,175 --> 01:47:29,509
- You were
trafficking in liquor,

1633
01:47:29,509 --> 01:47:31,511
that's a violation
of the Volstead Act.

1634
01:47:31,511 --> 01:47:33,447
- Yeah, maybe.

1635
01:47:34,714 --> 01:47:36,349
But you jumped the gun.

1636
01:47:36,349 --> 01:47:38,285
You didn't have a warrant.

1637
01:47:38,285 --> 01:47:40,620
You can't use that evidence.

1638
01:47:40,620 --> 01:47:41,455
- You murdered Jimmy.

1639
01:47:41,455 --> 01:47:42,656
He was just a kid.

1640
01:47:44,691 --> 01:47:46,326
- Where's the body?

1641
01:47:46,326 --> 01:47:48,995
(Jack chuckles)

1642
01:48:00,440 --> 01:48:02,275
- You think you got the
answers to everything,

1643
01:48:02,275 --> 01:48:03,944
don't you, Legs?

1644
01:48:03,944 --> 01:48:05,111
- I know I do.

1645
01:48:07,414 --> 01:48:09,015
- Maybe I should put
a hole in your head.

1646
01:48:09,015 --> 01:48:10,450
What's the answer to that?

1647
01:48:10,450 --> 01:48:12,185
(Jack chuckles)

1648
01:48:12,185 --> 01:48:13,887
- It'll never happen.

1649
01:48:15,489 --> 01:48:17,657
Let's face it, you're a sap.

1650
01:48:17,657 --> 01:48:20,293
All you believe in
is your fancy laws,

1651
01:48:20,293 --> 01:48:23,029
courtrooms, judges.

1652
01:48:23,029 --> 01:48:24,297
Me?

1653
01:48:24,297 --> 01:48:26,299
I believe in the
law of the street,

1654
01:48:26,299 --> 01:48:28,568
the gun, and the blackjack.

1655
01:48:30,437 --> 01:48:31,271
- Get out.

1656
01:48:34,741 --> 01:48:36,409
- All right.

1657
01:48:36,409 --> 01:48:38,778
I'll be seeing ya, G-man.

1658
01:48:38,778 --> 01:48:41,448
(Jack chuckles)

1659
01:48:55,729 --> 01:48:56,897
Stupid copper.

1660
01:49:08,775 --> 01:49:09,876
Hey, Dutch.

1661
01:49:10,777 --> 01:49:12,512
- I'll see you in hell, Legs.

1662
01:49:12,512 --> 01:49:14,247
But don't wait up for me.

1663
01:49:14,247 --> 01:49:16,583
(gun fires)

1664
01:49:32,966 --> 01:49:36,036
I've come too far
to miss on this.

1665
01:49:36,036 --> 01:49:38,371
(gun fires)

1666
01:49:42,442 --> 01:49:43,310
That's enough.

1667
01:49:44,511 --> 01:49:45,445
What a shame.

1668
01:49:48,014 --> 01:49:50,750
(dramatic music)

1669
01:49:58,425 --> 01:50:01,428
(melancholic music)

1670
01:50:32,659 --> 01:50:35,061
(woman sobs)

1671
01:51:17,337 --> 01:51:20,306
- Well, you couldn't have
messed this up any better.

1672
01:51:20,306 --> 01:51:21,408
- How do you figure?

1673
01:51:22,642 --> 01:51:24,978
We seized a major
shipment of hooch

1674
01:51:24,978 --> 01:51:27,881
and got rid of a public
menace at the same time.

1675
01:51:27,881 --> 01:51:30,183
- Well, you tell that
to Hoover, not to me.

1676
01:51:30,183 --> 01:51:31,785
I'll probably lose my job.

1677
01:51:31,785 --> 01:51:34,754
Hoover wanted to make
the pinch himself.

1678
01:51:34,754 --> 01:51:35,989
- Well, that's tough.

1679
01:51:35,989 --> 01:51:38,224
I'm sorry to disappoint him.

1680
01:51:38,224 --> 01:51:39,826
- Some bigshot
senator attacked him

1681
01:51:39,826 --> 01:51:41,461
for never getting
into the field,

1682
01:51:42,629 --> 01:51:44,564
never making any arrests.

1683
01:51:44,564 --> 01:51:46,599
You know, the tough
part of the job.

1684
01:51:47,567 --> 01:51:48,702
- Yeah.

1685
01:51:48,702 --> 01:51:50,003
Well, he can keep the job.

1686
01:51:51,504 --> 01:51:53,306
- Well, you've got
a plane to catch.

1687
01:51:57,277 --> 01:52:00,380
(lighthearted music)

1688
01:52:18,465 --> 01:52:21,968
(lighthearted jazz music)
