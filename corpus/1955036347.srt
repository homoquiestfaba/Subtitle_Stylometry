<i>Man. You're still here?
I thought I was too late.</i>

16
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:12,108
Too late for your birthday party?

17
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:15,176
You blue-lined, man.
They're coming.

18
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:16,779
No.

00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:18,447
<i>Look, I just found out, man. I'm sorry.</i>

20
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:22,558
Listen, if we don't get to speak again,
I just want to let you know

21
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:24,720

22
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:26,320

Come on now.

Come on, guys.
I'm scared of the dark.

46
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,352
How you doing?

47
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:19,558
Holden.

48
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:22,762
I thought you were retired.

49
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:25,056
- Yeah, I was.
- Well, what the hell are you doing here?

50
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:29,296
Well, I'm guessing that they liked me a lot

51
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:33,802
and probably needed me,
just like you might need me.

52
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:35,942
And why exactly do I need you?

53
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:39,608
Well, that way, you can keep
from wearing your ass as a hat.

54
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:45,579
Let's see. "Who is Blackjack?"

55
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,390
Let us read.

00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:54,722
"A lone-wolf patriot waging
a one-man cyber-war against a-holes."

57
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:58,865
Now, I've known you since you were 14.

58
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,097
What is this crap?

59
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,639
Have you seen my operating tempo?

60
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:04,037
Three targets in a month.

61
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:05,440
SOCOM is not amused.

62
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,135
So, they're arresting me?

63
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,307
That's brilliant.

64
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:11,211
They should be pinning a medal to my chest.

65
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,551
I wanted to pin
a waterboard on your back, Drew.

66
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,818
I'm sorry.
Are you Holden's new bitch?

67
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:18,946
You think this is funny?
Some kind of a joke?

68
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:21,217
No. Not at all, Agent Dolce.

69
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:23,322
Is Agent Gabbana close by?

70
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:26,625
Chicago's pitch black, Drew,
200,000 out of power.

71
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:29,466
Someone changed
the operating cycle on the generator,

72
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,228
causing it to go out of control.

73
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,600
We don't fix this in six hours,
the plant will have

74
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:36,105
irreversible damage, you understand?

75
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:37,903
Chicago will be pitch black for weeks.

76
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:40,274
Schools, hospitals, police stations.

77
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,505
- You get it?
- Okay, yeah.

78
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,121
So, what does this have to do with me?

79
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,740
Cyber-attacks. Someone hacked the plant.

80
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:47,785
And this is your new golden boy?

81
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,978
They can't hack that kind of thing.

82
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,645
This has to be an implant.

83
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,916
He's right. It's an implant.

84
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,425
Do you happen to recognize it?

85
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:01,464
- That's Pantheon.
- I see.

86
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,831
Up till a few hours ago,
we thought it was you.

87
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,083
No, this is impossible.

88
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,162
You can't use Pantheon
without the encryption key.

89
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:12,533
You lost the key?

90
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:15,044
- You created it. You can stop it.
- No.

91
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:16,704
No, no, I can't.

92
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:19,044
That's the whole point. You need the key.

93
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:20,549
If you have it, you control the implant.

94
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,880
If you don't, some jihadi prick

95
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,511
- gets to rule the world.
- All right, listen.

96
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:24,986
What's our next course of action?

97
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:26,523
Stop shaving and learn Arabic.

98
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,024
Now, listen.
Let me ask you something.

99
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,220
And I want an honest answer.

100
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:35,322
This is really important
to me and it's even more important to you.

101
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:38,966
- Did you put in a back-door?
- No.

102
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:42,700
No, if I'd put in a back-door, that would've
been illegal and I would've gone to jail.

103
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,502
You're going to jail anyway.

104
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:50,578
If there were a back-door, and I'm not
saying that there is because there isn't,

105
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:55,210
but if there were, I would want a signed
immunity agreement before I revealed it.

106
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:00,688
Holy shit,
you really lost the key?

107
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:02,666
I thought you were bluffing
to get the back-door.

108
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:04,159
This is really bad, you guys.

109
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,857
Do you have any idea what's gonna happen?

110
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,259
Yeah, there's a back-door.

111
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:13,735
Just uncuff me so that I can use it.

114
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:27,849
I could double the speed.

124
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:15,127

125
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,232
Great, so I'll tell him.

126
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:19,561
Thank you.

Everyone, problem's over.

No damage.

129
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:28,772
- All right.
- Good job.

130
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,316
Way to go, kid.

131
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,912
What are you talking about?

132
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:41,083
That back-door crap. It worked.

133
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,649
- I didn't do anything.
- What?

134
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,455
I was locked out.
I was locked out.

135
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:47,157
Whoever stole the key patched the...

136
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:49,990
Patched the back-door.

137
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,295
They're good.

138
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:53,530
They're leagues better than
anyone you have working at SOCOM.

139
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,196
I've been scrambling to
find another way in,

140
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:59,606
but without the encrypted key,
there's nothing I can do.

141
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:00,871
What are you saying?

142
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:05,211
I'm saying that whoever has Pantheon
turned it off themselves. Not me.

143
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:08,046
Wait a minute.
Why would they do that?

144
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,854
That was a test run.

145
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,858
They're showing what Pantheon can do.

146
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,195
<i>Pantheon is an implant.</i>

147
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,700
An implant is like a worm,

148
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,468
only with a PhD and a nuke
strapped to its back.

149
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:35,144
We introduce it to a network
and it propagates from there.

150
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:39,650
Once it's in place, it lays dormant,
waiting for a signal to wake it up

151
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:41,707
and then it wreaks havoc.

152
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:45,050
It's more dangerous
than a standing army or a dozen nukes.

153
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:48,717
All you need to control it
is the encrypted data key.

154
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:52,318
It's a physical key, it's one of
a kind, it cannot be duplicated.

155
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:57,334
The code changes every ten-millionth
of a second in sync with the implant,

156
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:02,396
so if you copy the key,
it falls out of sync, you lose control.

157
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:04,606
It's been spreading since 2008.

158
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:08,044
So, coverage at this point
is probably around 80%.

159
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,040
Of what?

160
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,113
The world.

161
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,720
<i>Every terrorist group
and hostile government in the world</i>

162
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:21,418
<i>is gonna try to get
their hands on the Pantheon key.</i>

163
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:25,218
And if they do, they'll have the
power to blackout any city,

164
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:29,790
derail any train, melt down any
power plant, all from a laptop,

165
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,698
<i>with just a few lines of code.</i>

166
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,109
<i>The fact that the hackers
who stole this didn't blow up Chicago</i>

167
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:44,111
<i>tells me he's coin-operated, and that
blanking out the city was just a demo.</i>

168
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:47,081
<i>So that he can sell it
to the highest bidder.</i>

169
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:03,066
You want to nuke Tokyo, flood Rio,
burn Moscow or London, this is your guy.

170
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:07,499
Whatever we do, we have to track him down
and find him before he sells that key.

171
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:09,802
Okay, then.

172
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:14,139
Drew, here, will be a member of a team
that Agent Connelly is putting together

173
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,077
and I want you to know we're gonna put
everything we've got out there

174
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:18,843
to stop this thing, okay?

175
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:19,973
So, thanks.

176
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:31,755
Sir, with all due respect, he can't be trusted
and we don't need a geek in the field.

177
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:34,991
All due respect,
all you need is me in the field, okay?

178
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,434
This is not a team operation.

179
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,867
That's why I left SOCOM
in the first place. I work alone.

180
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:43,372
I really don't remember
asking either one of you for your opinion.

181
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:46,170
So, shut the hell up, okay?

182
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:49,677
Now, you will lead and,
Drew, you will follow.

183
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,476
<i>Adios.</i>

184
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,451
Thank you, sir.

185
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:00,482
- You don't want me on a team.
- What?

186
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,287
You don't want me on a team.

187
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:04,453
I don't play well with others, okay?

188
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:05,996
You know that about me.

189
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:08,531
I mean, people are fine
in the abstract, but up close and personal,

190
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,793
they're the worst.

191
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:11,459
I know that. I mean, I understand.

192
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,367
I know you're very
comfortable hiding in your trailer,

193
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,530
playing with your little toys.

194
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,972
See, but those days are kind of over.

195
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,067
So, you got two options.

196
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,041
A, you can take that
wonderful talent you have

197
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:26,878
and let it rot in a cell
for 30 to 50 years,

198
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:30,379
or, B, be a man and be useful, okay?

199
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:31,916
You said I'd have immunity.

200
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:33,684
This is Eastern Europe.
I don't need to charge you.

201
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:36,249
I've got three black sites
within an hour's drive of here.

202
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,592
I'm not going back.

203
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:42,759
Drew.

204
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,730
This is your code.

205
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:49,996
There are millions, millions of people
whose lives are at stake.

206
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:52,269
And if I'm going to stop it, I need you.

207
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:55,102
I know it's going to be
really, really dangerous.

208
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,545
I mean, horror of all horrors,

209
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,173
you are going to have to
deal with real people.

210
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,617
Fine.

211
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:07,754
But I get to choose the rest of the team.

212
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,724
Because if Tom Slick chooses the team,

213
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,262
I'm gonna be surrounded by frat boys

214
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,991
with firm handshakes and five-year plans.

215
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,693
Fine, I'll get you the dossiers
on 20 of our top agents, and you pick.

216
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:18,632
I don't want your dossiers,
I can hack your personnel files.

217
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:20,601
- And I sure as shit don't want your top 20.
- Why, why, why?

218
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,196
Because it's full
of fast-trackers and yes-men, okay?

219
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:24,764
No, I've got an algorithm.

220
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:28,437
It will choose the best
team scientifically.

221
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:39,613
<i>You picked these guys?</i>

222
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,625
They're throwaways,
they're finished, washed up.

223
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:46,054
I mean, maybe they'll use
them for suicide missions.

224
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:48,064
The numbers don't lie.

225
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,889
This job, these are the best people.

226
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:51,400
Have you read their files?

227
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:52,800
Yeah, I glanced at them.

228
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,570
Dan Fisher.

229
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:59,576
<i>He managed to roid-rage his way
into blowing every one of his missions.</i>

230
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:03,010
He was kicked back to making copies
in the embassy sub-basement.

231
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:23,790
<i>- Amalgamated vending.</i>
- Yes.

232
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:26,359
Machine number zero, eight, nine, six...

233
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,096
<i>Thank you for calling with your concern.</i>

234
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,668
<i>All of our operators are busy right now.</i>

235
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,710
<i>Estimated hold time is 47 minutes.</i>

236
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:50,323
<i>All you have to do is insert the
change, press the button then, wow,</i>

237
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:51,986
<i>fresh snacks.</i>

238
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,190
Hello!

239
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,838
Gloria Miller.

240
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,376
Swallow.

241
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:13,743
Come on, don't call her that.

242
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,182
- What's a swallow?
- He's right.

243
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:18,220
It's just a disgusting term
the KGB used to use.

244
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:24,426
She's actually an agent who uses
special weapons to get intelligence.

245
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,219
Special weapons?

246
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,791
Another happy customer, Miller?

247
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,525
Screw you, Langstrom.

248
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,528
Listen, I got a lead from him on Ukraine.

249
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:08,094
An FSB operative
is coming in from Moscow tomorrow night.

250
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:10,933
- And maybe I could intercept...
- We can take it from here.

251
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:32,928
Dmitri Stanislov.

252
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:39,734
Former KGB.

253
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:41,271
He speaks Russian.

254
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:44,126
Yeah. According to
his S.O., he's not good for anything else.

255
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,173
You.

256
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:53,348
You commie.

257
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:58,612
He was on that failed Ukrainian
Ministry Building run last month.

258
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:05,025
You left me.

259
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:09,027
I got cavity searched
in a Ukraine prison because of you.

260
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:10,832
Fuck.

261
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:13,197
Dmitri!

262
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,832
No, because of you.

263
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,275
You were late.

264
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:25,475
Dmitri, get back here!

265
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,009
<i>You blew the mission, not me.</i>

266
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,778
Because of me?

267
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:33,687
Okay, no, guys, guys.
You need to settle down.

268
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:36,623
Well, you picked them. Go brief them.

269
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:43,357
I said, get up and go fucking brief them.

270
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:50,973
I ought to kill you right here.

271
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:52,508
Come on.

272
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:52,997
You left me! I want an apology!

273
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:55,308
You left me! I want an apology!

274
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:56,812
You were late.

275
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:57,973
Hey!

276
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:02,477
Hi.

277
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,590
I see you've been acquainted.

278
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,253
Yeah, so, thank you
for coming on such short notice.

279
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:14,728
Who the hell are you?

280
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:16,860
I'm... I'm Drew.

281
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,530
Are you intelligence or an intern?

282
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:23,571
I'm, just... I'm, you know, just me.

283
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:27,707
A private contractor of sorts.

284
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,540
What do you do exactly?

285
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:32,545
Well, that's difficult
to describe, you know.

286
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:35,881
I'm probably best known for CVE-2010-1807.

287
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:42,055
But, you know, my passion is for Boolean
operations and complex adaptive systems.

288
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:44,588
- So, you know, it's natural that...
- Drew!

289
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,391
Christ's sakes, show 'em, will ya?
Just show 'em!

290
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:53,096
So, I'm just gonna show you guys.

291
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:55,996
Name someone you actively dislike.

292
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:58,399
Christopher F. Langstrom.

293
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,746
For someone with his clearance,
that was embarrassingly easy.

294
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:10,016
Current tax return has him living
on Glen View Terrace in Herndon, Virginia.

295
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,453
It turns out you were correct.

296
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:15,081
He is a world-class douche bag,
he was actually

297
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:18,226
diagnosed with Narcissistic
Personality Disorder.

298
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:21,219
How did you get his password so quickly?

299
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,290
Well, he uses
an NSA type 2 encryption,

300
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:26,892
which he thinks is safe,
but, really, there's a known vulnerability.

301
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,319
And he's e-mailed himself
all his passwords,

302
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,834
so if you guys want to drain
his bank account, we can do that.

303
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:33,804
What else can you do?

304
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:41,250
We could turn his phone
into a listening device,

305
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,278
or a live camera feed.

306
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:46,722
Look, now I have his real-time location,

307
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:50,254
and control over his vehicle.

308
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:53,589
Three lines of code
and I could send his car into a brick wall.

309
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:55,097
So, what do you guys think?

310
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:57,931
Should we kill this fucker?

311
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,901
Yeah? Murder, anyone?

312
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:04,235
Tell you what. Let's see the system.

313
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,307
Looks like he's got another Gmail account.

314
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:10,744
This one he uses for numerous affairs
with female staffers.

315
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:11,940
She's cute.

316
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:13,678
So, what do you think?

317
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,274
You want him divorced or fired?

318
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,648
I'm tempted.

319
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:24,023
Yeah, you don't have to raise your... Yes?

320
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,528
I will do mission on one condition.

321
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:30,123
You never go in my mail, okay?

322
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,668
Because sometimes
I have e-mailed pictures that are jokes.

323
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:41,036
Not photos that turn me on, photos that
turn very strange people on, understand?

324
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:50,010
I'm driving this crap of junk?

325
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,381
It's for surveillance, not for racing.

326
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,820
Pick one.

327
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:56,820
Go in.

328
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:01,624
I'm good. Shotgun.

329
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:03,223
No, I have pistol.

330
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,165
No, I mean, I
called the front seat.

331
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,327
Speaking of shotguns,
where's the heavy weapons?

332
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:09,804
Can't I at least get an FIM-92?

333
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:11,065
A what?

334
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:13,734
A bazooka, man. A bazooka.

335
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:16,639
You're not getting a goddamn bazooka.

336
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:19,308
Would you rather be
the guy who has one and doesn't need it,

337
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:22,215
or the guy who needs one
but doesn't have it?

338
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:24,880
You're giving me a headache. Get in.

339
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,215
You should at least
give me some grenades, man.

340
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,021
No, no, no.

341
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:34,257
Put it down, put it down.

342
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,027
Not for geeks, it's for agents, okay?

343
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:39,032
It's none of your business.

344
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,061
Sir, are you sure about this?

345
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,230
No.

346
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,086
I can't find the Pantheon key,

347
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:02,454
but the code did give me
a line on who patched the back-door.

348
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:05,692
I've got no name or photo,
but I was able to track the IP address

349
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:07,890
of whoever patched
the back-door to this location.

350
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:13,737
This is a skinhead bar.

351
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:16,864
Great. Any chance we get, let's mix it up.

352
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:19,135
- Excuse me?
- These guys are nee-Nazis, right?

353
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:21,741
It'd be a shame to come
all this way and not bust a couple heads.

354
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,972
Fisher, stop it.

355
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,981
I just need to tap into the guy's computer
and get some information, that's it.

356
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,607
Yeah, Fisher. Low-profile, okay?

357
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:29,947
No bazookas,
no fist fighting, you understand?

358
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,453
You stay in the van.
Dmitri, come back me up.

359
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,317
Impossible.

360
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:38,253
What is he saying?

361
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:41,297
I am one twelfth Jewish
on my mother's side.

362
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:43,730
These guys will kill me.

363
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:45,962
English. Hey, English, okay?

364
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:49,461
I drive. Ls better.

365
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:52,173
I am driver.

366
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,436
Pussy.

367
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:55,603
Listen, I'll go in. But I should go alone.

368
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:58,147
Right. I mean,
how much tactical experience do you have?

369
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:00,579
I speak hacker. I can talk to them.

370
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:02,016
Right, well, that's why I'm getting wired,

371
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:05,067
so you can stay in the van with the girl
here and translate the geek-speak.

372
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,484
Sorry.

373
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:08,649
I had to reposition it.

374
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:11,250
Listen, it's not as easy
as just feeding you the lingo, okay?

375
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:12,522
If I go in...

376
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:13,925
Look, look. I go in alone.

377
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:15,760
You stay here with the
rest of the dropouts.

378
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:17,095
What about me?

379
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:19,157
You know, I could help.

380
00:24:20,258 --> 00:24:22,534
Um, there's no use
for your skill set on this mission,

381
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:25,005
- but you keep it warm and we'll find...
- Test, test, test.

382
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:29,338
Do you wanna wait till I go outside?

383
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,141
I'm just testing the equipment.

384
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:32,546
It's great.

385
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:34,883
Here you go.

386
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:29,668
All right,
there's four assholes in here with laptops.

387
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:31,207
What does he look like?

388
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:36,569
Shaved head,
black clothes, puke-white skin.

389
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:37,772
Screw you, Drew.

390
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:41,339
Hey, Dmitri, how's your Bulgarian?

391
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:46,845
Good enough for government work...

392
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:52,021
and playing around with...

393
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:53,619
prostitutes.

394
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:57,924
That's good. I don't know what you said.

395
00:25:58,623 --> 00:25:59,795
Yeah.

396
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,932
I need you to reply to this post, okay.

397
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:05,474
This guy is a huge Levski football fan.

398
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:06,770
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

399
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:10,904
So, why don't you say, "lvo will be
lucky to score three goals this season."

400
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:12,778
"He's barely League One material."

401
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:16,541
lvo is their best player.

402
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:18,383
He will score 20...

403
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:19,922
I'm sure he's really, really good.

404
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:21,082
- Best, best.
- Yeah.

405
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:23,146
Could you just write down
exactly what I just said?

406
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:24,422
.Okay-.Okay-

407
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:27,290
- My typing is for shit.
- Okay, that's all right.

408
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:33,795
Wow.

409
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:45,139
You're literally
killing me right now.

410
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,849
This isn't working.

411
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,612
You need to go faster than this.

412
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:52,015
All right, any day now.

413
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,646
<i>All right, pissing him off,</i>

414
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:57,657
pissing him off in three, two, one.

415
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:03,521
All right, I got him. I'm headed in.

416
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,262
Wait, wait, you can't just head in, okay.
I haven't briefed you.

417
00:27:06,324 --> 00:27:09,999
These Bulgarian hackers
specialize in anti-virtualization.

418
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:11,696
<i>Relax, I'll put this thing in the thing.</i>

419
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:14,334
<i>I don't know why you geeks
gotta complicate everything.</i>

420
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:18,012
Three vodkas.

421
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:04,051
Stop him!

422
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,090
Take it easy.

423
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:08,693
Hey, Drew, they made me.

424
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,891
- I warned you.
- Okay, we'll leave now.

425
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:14,326
Sit down, you yellow commie bastard!

426
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:15,564
I'm going in.

427
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,071
Fisher, sit down.

428
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:19,082
Everyone, just calm down!
Jesus, you're children.

429
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,938
Hey, take it easy.

430
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,410
All right.

431
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:25,105
Ease off, guys.

432
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:27,674
Connelly, if you want to live,

433
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:31,209
repeat every word Dmitri says right now,
phonetically, okay?

434
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,287
All right.

435
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:38,553
Reading Bulgarian, okay,
but speaking, very different.

436
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:39,788
I don't recommend?

437
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:42,763
Dmitri, listen to me.
You're all I've got, okay.

438
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:46,131
So, you need to translate
this for me right now, okay.

439
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:48,570
Take, here.

440
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:52,639
You passed the test!

441
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:58,136
On that SD card there are
120,000 credit card accounts.

442
00:28:58,303 --> 00:28:59,823
I'll sell them to you for 5,000 euros.

443
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:02,249
I accept your offer of 5,000...

444
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:06,086
and I will sell you
back your life for 5,000.

445
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:08,154
- I'm going in.
- Fisher!

446
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:10,289
Fisher, where the hell are you going?

447
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:13,055
Are you gonna let
these anti-Semite pieces of shit win?

448
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:14,563
No way!

449
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:16,259
Not me!

450
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:17,561
Fisher, you don't need to go in there.

451
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:19,966
The chip worked.
I can get them to let him go.

452
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:21,893
Bazooka time.

453
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:34,506
Hey, everyone.

454
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:38,417
I have an announcement to make.

455
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,024
Shalom, motherfuckers.

456
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,372
We have to help them.

457
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:01,302
No, "0. no, no."

458
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:16,157
Dmitri! Not again.

459
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,853
- No!
- What are you doing?

460
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,880
Drew, get ready with the door.

461
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,378
Go, go, go!

462
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,367
Here.

463
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:42,204
Yeah?

464
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:45,379
Slow down.

465
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:47,607
<i>- Was it random?</i>
- What do <i>you mean?</i>

466
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:51,545
Was it just a robbery,
or were you targeted?

467
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:55,151
I can't say, but they were American.

468
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:57,054
Was everything encrypted?

469
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:58,719
<i>Yes. Of course.</i>

470
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:03,930
That's good. You did everything right then.

471
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:06,298
<i>Go back inside and don't worry.</i>

472
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:07,631
Shit happens.

473
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:09,295
<i>Thanks, man.</i>

474
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:32,623
I got bit by a chubby, goulash-scented Nazi

475
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:34,960
because Fisher here
was born with an extra pair

476
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:37,522
of testicles instead of a brain.

477
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:39,768
- Wasn't goulash.
- What?

478
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,165
Goulash is Hungarian.

479
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:47,608
The Nazi that bit you
most likely smelled like chlopski posilek.

480
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:49,938
- You don't get to speak. You ran.
- What?

481
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,543
I was not running.

482
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,675
I was going to lead them away
and then move back around.

483
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:02,115
Fisher!

484
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:08,979
Holden is looking for you.

485
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:16,903
I thought I could hide up here.

486
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:21,867
What exactly are you hiding from?

487
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:30,379
You don't...

488
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:33,317
You don't remember me, do you?

489
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:39,822
I had long hair and braces,
and I was 30 pounds heavier.

490
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:41,056
I had a beard.

491
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:46,332
Reston Skateway.

492
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:51,838
The year was 2000.
I was playing Mortal Kombat.

493
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,270
Mortal what?

494
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,037
You don't know what Mortal Kombat is?

495
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,403
No.

496
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:59,544
It's a video game.

497
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:06,347
Anyway, you were wearing
this tight red, um...

498
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,317
It was like a half-shirt.

499
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,522
And, you asked me about hacking.

500
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,220
I told you everything.

501
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:18,232
I even made some stuff up to impress you.

502
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:21,735
I'm sorry, I don't remember you.

503
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:32,674
The Feds broke down my door a week later
and charged me with 30 felonies.

504
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,774
So, thank you.
Thank you for not

505
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:37,443
remembering ruining my life.

506
00:34:39,944 --> 00:34:42,083
What do you want?
Some kind of tearful apology?

507
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,888
No, I just... I liked you.
And you said that you liked me.

508
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:48,394
- And I know that was a long time ago...
- Wait. Is that why you picked me?

509
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:50,296
You wanted some kind of revenge?

510
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:52,299
- Is that it?
- No, I didn't want revenge.

511
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,392
- No, no.
- Look, I don't remember you.

512
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:01,910
I was a virgin.

513
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:08,810
Yeah?

514
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:12,614
Well, we were all virgins once.

515
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:23,822
God, amen.

516
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:26,795
Hey, Drew, you wanna tell me
what the hell we're doing here?

517
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,728
The chip you put in
the laptop didn't tell us

518
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:30,162
the location of the Pantheon key.

519
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:31,723
But it did tell us who's selling it.

520
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:35,630
His name is Teebs, he's a black hat hacker
who sells chaos to the highest bidder.

521
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:37,703
So, we're here to take down this dweeb?

522
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:39,832
- Kick his ass silly?
- No, no.

523
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:42,137
Teebs is a ghost.
Nobody even knows his real name.

524
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,679
We're looking for his broker.

525
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:45,208
Broker?

526
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:47,179
Why does he need broker?

527
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:48,683
<i>Well,
when you're selling something ephemeral,</i>

528
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:51,049
like a zero-day, or an encryption key,

529
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:53,486
black-market buyers
want independent verification

530
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,649
that what they're buying is legit.

531
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,488
And the seller
wants to make sure that they get paid.

532
00:36:57,648 --> 00:36:58,991
So, they hire a third party.

533
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:04,826
This broker verifies and vouches
for both parties and negotiates the terms.

534
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:06,990
And what makes you think he's here?

535
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:08,095
He's not.

536
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:09,932
Not yet. But he will be.

537
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:12,668
Every e-mail he sent Vitally
originated from the public Wi-Fi here.

538
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:13,901
This is like his office.

539
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:15,906
Yeah, well, he better hurry up,

540
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,276
because the next person
who asks for a half-caf, no whip,

541
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:19,541
I'm punching in the face.

542
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,907
<i>No, Fisher. No punching.</i>

543
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:24,748
<i>No fighting, no kicking, no biting.
Do you understand that?</i>

544
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:27,022
We're just gonna tail this guy.
You got that?

545
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,581
You and the geek stay
behind if it gets bad.

546
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,182
Geek squad, you read that?

547
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,209
<i>Yeah, my phone
will ping me when he fogs on.</i>

548
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,061
My God, he's an asshole.

549
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:40,866
Yeah, well, most of them are.

550
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:46,609
So, you don't have a gun either?

551
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:47,903
No.

552
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:52,071
You know whatever's wrong with me
that makes me good at computers

553
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:55,310
makes me especially shitty
at spatial tasking.

554
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,744
What about you?

555
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:00,789
I don't really need one with my skill set.

556
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:04,887
That's bullshit. You know that, right?
That's nonsense.

557
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:06,889
You saved all of our lives.

558
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:11,562
Maybe they're too
proud to admit it, but I'm not.

559
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:18,904
Well, maybe on the next mission they can
reward me by letting me wear pants.

560
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:21,166
I'm freezing.

561
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:26,946
Well, I...

562
00:38:27,905 --> 00:38:30,249
I was, smart this morning.

563
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,784
And I have a layer.

564
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:37,515
There you go.

565
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:39,827
My God.

566
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:43,357
I remember you from the skating rink now.

567
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:46,197
You gave me your hoodie then, too.

568
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:49,701
You insisted on driving me home.

569
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:51,933
- You were sweet.
- I was stupid.

570
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,634
- It was sweet.
- Nah.

571
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,034
What happened to that guy?

572
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,606
You happened to that guy.

573
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,948
Hey, he's here. He logged in.

574
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:15,888
Connelly. He's by you.

575
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:17,488
The plaza.

576
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,330
<i>A“ fight, Fisher, headed your way.</i>

577
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:26,236
Got him.

578
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:30,236
I guess he likes coffee.

579
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:35,214
May I have a cappuccino, please?

580
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,311
Make that a cappuccino.

581
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:42,522
- All right, Miller, you're up.
- I'm up?

582
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,923
<i>Do I need to spell it out?</i>

583
00:39:44,014 --> 00:39:46,094
Connelly, we don't
have to do it this way, all right.

584
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:49,426
I'll approach him, I'll tell him I
have a zero-day exploit to sell.

585
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:51,430
There's no time for that.

586
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:54,996
Listen, you don't have to do this.

587
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,232
I've done worse.

588
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,732
Besides, we're saving the world, right?

589
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:07,048
<i>Drew, relax, man.</i>

590
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:11,378
By all means necessary.

591
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:13,922
Sometimes you gotta take one for the team.

592
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:20,421
Excuse me, is there anyone sitting here?

593
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:22,964
- No one, go ahead.
- Thank you, you're very kind.

594
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:27,300
It's really beautiful here.
Are you from here?

595
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:29,537
No, I'm not.

596
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:32,369
Really? Me, neither.
I'm American, what about you?

597
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:34,134
Your coffee, sir.

598
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:36,035
Thank you, love.

599
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:41,709
He's a new guy.
Did you see his eyebrow?

600
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:43,975
He's a bad boy.

601
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:50,132
I'm sorry.
Could you just excuse me for a second?

602
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,722
Wait. What? What happened?

603
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,493
He's, not into me.

604
00:40:57,588 --> 00:41:00,501
But I think Fisher might be his type.

605
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:03,271
<i>Hey, Fish.
Sometimes we gotta take one for the team.</i>

606
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:05,464
By any means necessary, right?

607
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:08,109
No way.

608
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:11,510
Give him your number.
Ask him to lunch.

609
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:14,181
Give him my number?
I ain't no swallow, okay.

610
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:16,984
Male swallow is called "raven."

611
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:19,176
I would have made a great one.

612
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:21,410
Yeah, well,
I ain't doing it, so forget it.

613
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:23,952
Too late. He's on the move.

614
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:29,962
Okay, spread out,
but stay on him.

615
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:37,369
Dmitri, he's headed your way.

616
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,133
I see him.

617
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:03,729
<i>Dmitri, stay on him.</i>

618
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,693
Why would he pick Fisher over me?

619
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:12,968
I am more manly. Better looking.

620
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,139
Dmitri!

621
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:22,314
Hey, hey. Don't get too close.

622
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,910
I have a really strong signal,
I can track him anywhere.

623
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:28,320
I know now why
he wanted Fisher and not me.

624
00:42:28,812 --> 00:42:30,689
He was looking for goalie.

625
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:33,419
I am striker.

626
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:38,225
<i>Dmitri! Where the hell is he?</i>

627
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,998
Not too far. Just to subway.

628
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,364
Lose that junk of crap and follow him!

629
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:45,498
Drew said he had signal.

630
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:48,939
<i>I got this guy.</i>

631
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:51,045
<i>Keep a safe distance, but stay on him.</i>

632
00:42:51,268 --> 00:42:53,111
<i>Dmitri, you wanna get out of the car?</i>

633
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:55,281
I'm double parked, they will tow.

634
00:43:02,112 --> 00:43:04,114
I'm going Brooklyn on this mommy.

635
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:08,519
Hey. Hey, guys. I just gotta...

636
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:11,230
Hey, hey! Don't be putting
your hands on me.

637
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:13,632
Get your fucking hands off me!

638
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:17,400
Okay, okay. Relax, you got me. You got me.

639
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,415
I'm on him.

640
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:33,956
<i>Stand</i> down.

641
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:36,784
<i>Gloria, he made you.
Stand back and wait for me.</i>

642
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:41,256
- I'm right behind him.
- He's made you, <i>wait</i> for me.

643
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:46,842
All right, I still have the signal.
I'm gonna go to the next station.

644
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:58,408
Connelly, he's right here, we can take him.

645
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,513
No, stand back, he made you, wait for me.

646
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:05,954
Shit!

647
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:07,282
Shit.

648
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:10,625
- Drew, you still have the signal?
- Yeah, I still got him.

649
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:13,184
The signal's still very strong.

650
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:21,166
Wait a minute, it's gone,
I dropped the signal.

651
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:24,804
He's gone.

652
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,536
Holden's team found the broker.

653
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,723
I can't have you
tapping citizens' cell phones.

654
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:55,399
Or your team
running around the city resisting arrest.

655
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:57,170
I understand that.

656
00:44:58,128 --> 00:45:01,075
I'll keep them clean, I
just need a little rope.

657
00:45:01,165 --> 00:45:04,009
Maybe another 24 hours, that's all.

658
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:05,706
All right, 24 hours.

659
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:07,305
Thank you very much.

660
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:18,319
Sir.

661
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:21,659
Sir! Doctor!

662
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,173
<i>Da.</i>

663
00:45:48,612 --> 00:45:50,717
He lived?

664
00:45:52,716 --> 00:45:55,788
Just make sure that you
get the winning bid.

665
00:46:02,126 --> 00:46:03,400
How is he?

666
00:46:04,795 --> 00:46:06,706
He just got out of hospital an hour ago.

667
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,376
He's one tough
son of a bitch, I'll give you that.

668
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,874
The triggerman did get away,

669
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:13,710
but the Lieutenant was able to
convince our Bulgarian friends here

670
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:16,579
to give us access
to all the cellular towers in the country.

671
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:17,778
Drew?

672
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:19,081
Yeah, I got a signal on the broker's phone,

673
00:46:19,143 --> 00:46:21,248
as long as he keeps the battery in it,
I can track him anywhere.

674
00:46:21,311 --> 00:46:22,449
Okay.

675
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:24,286
My new team goes out in five.

676
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,728
What? New team?

677
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,457
A new team?

678
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:31,163
What are you talking about?
This is our mission.

679
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:33,130
Come on, Drew. Back us up, man.

680
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:35,430
- Gentlemen, Holden needs you in office.
- This is our mission.

681
00:46:35,492 --> 00:46:37,492
Who, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you going?

682
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:41,734
Hey, guys. You surprised me.

683
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:44,072
You weren't half bad, considering...

684
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:56,419
Considering what?

685
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,016
You know what, this is a good thing.

686
00:46:58,115 --> 00:46:59,635
We're all still alive, we can go home.

687
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,153
- Drew? Drew?
- We can live our lives, we can...

688
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,594
Considering what?

689
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:09,865
Considering who you are. Considering, um...

690
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:14,039
Considering how I picked you guys.

691
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:17,268
We know how you picked us.
It was the algorithms.

692
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:19,235
You hacked the database,
crunched the numbers.

693
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:21,044
We came out on top.

694
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:22,810
Right?

695
00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:25,617
I did hack the database.

696
00:47:26,877 --> 00:47:29,323
But I was looking for agents who were C-86.

697
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:32,951
C-86? What's that?

698
00:47:33,116 --> 00:47:35,460
It's a classification
for agents who are,

699
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:39,162
<i>throwaways.</i>

700
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:42,298
Disposable.

701
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:44,397
You brought us here to die?

702
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:46,701
No. I brought you here to fail!

703
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:50,235
I was hoping that if we washed out early,
Holden would disband us

704
00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:52,473
and I could go back to working alone.

705
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:54,877
I ain't no throwaway!

706
00:47:55,339 --> 00:47:58,081
I knew they were sending me
on suicide mission!

707
00:47:58,976 --> 00:48:00,319
That's why I ran.

708
00:48:00,644 --> 00:48:03,682
You guys saw what
they tried to do to Holden because of me.

709
00:48:04,348 --> 00:48:06,555
None of us are cut out
for an assignment like this.

710
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:08,823
Let's be honest, okay?

711
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:11,389
- You son of a bitch.
- Gloria...

712
00:48:11,488 --> 00:48:14,765
You know, I gave up being taken
seriously as an agent a long time ago,

713
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:17,699
then you come along
and offer us a real assignment

714
00:48:18,695 --> 00:48:20,265
and tell us it was all a joke.

715
00:48:20,364 --> 00:48:21,672
You're not a joke.

716
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,444
I just wanted to get to know you.

717
00:48:27,037 --> 00:48:30,075
Why don't you just go back
to playing with your little toys?

718
00:48:38,448 --> 00:48:40,052
<i>I'm sorry...</i>

719
00:48:55,132 --> 00:48:57,271
The signal's still
strong from the inside.

720
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:01,815
<i>Go in, get the broker, and then get out.</i>

721
00:49:53,457 --> 00:49:55,177
Yo, man,
I got your message, man. What's up?

722
00:49:55,225 --> 00:49:57,501
Yeah, we think a black hatter
named Teebs has Pantheon.

723
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,265
Didn't he speak in Antwerp last year?

724
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:02,401
Yeah. Demonstrated how
he could take over a 747 with his iPhone.

725
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:03,638
The guy's a legit psycho.

726
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:06,408
Okay, I need you to pull up whatever
surveillance pics you can. All right?

727
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:07,744
Just single him out.

728
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:11,183
I think we got a few of him on stage, but
the guy's wearing a mask. He's not dumb.

729
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:13,317
What exactly are you looking for?

730
00:50:13,643 --> 00:50:16,453
I don't know, man.
Just pull whatever you can, okay?

731
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:17,924
<i>All right.</i>

732
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,969
All right,
we're closing in, boys.

733
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,808
Signal's red-hot.

734
00:50:58,255 --> 00:51:00,257
They're right on top of him.

735
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:12,607
Shit!

736
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:15,215
He's not here, sir.

737
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:16,792
There's definitely somebody been here.

738
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,046
Guys, he on the move.

739
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:19,678
Shit! He's right above us.

740
00:51:53,543 --> 00:51:55,819
Sir? We've got a mule in here.

741
00:51:56,213 --> 00:51:57,283
So get rid of him.

742
00:51:58,315 --> 00:51:59,953
The signal's on the mule.

743
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:13,933
<i>It's the broker.</i>

744
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:16,166
Connelly! Connelly, get out of there!

745
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:17,843
Everyone out!

746
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:19,572
I repeat, fall back!

747
00:52:19,836 --> 00:52:21,179
Stanford, watch your six!

748
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:23,577
Stanford! Do you read?

749
00:52:25,075 --> 00:52:26,418
Stanford!

750
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:36,490
Princeton!

751
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:48,268
Connelly?

752
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:50,004
Princeton, I lost signal.

753
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:51,972
Princeton?

754
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:01,452
Jennifer?

755
00:53:01,645 --> 00:53:03,056
Hey, Dan.

756
00:53:03,146 --> 00:53:04,284
Miss me?

757
00:53:11,221 --> 00:53:12,359
Killed them.

758
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,030
That's it? That's what you want?

759
00:53:46,089 --> 00:53:47,898
That surprises you?

760
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:51,035
Hey. It's your money, man. Your choice.

761
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:55,274
But if you have a beef with Moscow,
I can melt them down.

762
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:57,902
I melt down Moscow and I get what?

763
00:53:58,435 --> 00:54:01,609
Nothing but dead brothers
and martial law for my enemy.

764
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:06,077
My army will
never be big enough to get me back home.

765
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:07,712
But if I have friends,

766
00:54:07,944 --> 00:54:12,017
armies in other countries,
then, then perhaps I could.

767
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:14,061
A false flag.

768
00:54:14,117 --> 00:54:16,393
Blow up your own place,
then blame the bad guys.

769
00:54:18,054 --> 00:54:20,762
- Everyone needs a Pearl Harbor.
- Okay.

770
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:23,966
I'll make it happen from the airport.

771
00:54:24,194 --> 00:54:26,401
Lights go out, you'll know it's on.

772
00:54:26,796 --> 00:54:30,107
Just transfer the money to my account
and I'll bump it to phase two.

773
00:54:30,967 --> 00:54:33,413
I prefer that you stay until it's over.

774
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:37,380
That's not the deal we brokered.

775
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,942
Broker is dead.

776
00:54:41,378 --> 00:54:43,722
Bes. Take him out.

777
00:54:51,554 --> 00:54:53,727
Now, that would be foolish.

778
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:58,234
He pays me twice what you do.

779
00:55:08,571 --> 00:55:10,244
How long do you need?

780
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:11,581
Ten minutes.

781
00:55:12,175 --> 00:55:13,347
Five.

782
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:21,826
We got the Pentagon on satellite link.

783
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:23,192
Great. Put him on.

784
00:55:23,586 --> 00:55:24,758
Hey, Bens. What's up?

785
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:26,266
<i>Hey, Holden, listen to me.</i>

786
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:28,496
<i>I got a hit on your female assassin.</i>

787
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:31,366
<i>Her name is Bettina "Bes" Karpov.</i>

788
00:55:31,594 --> 00:55:35,132
<i>She is a human chameleon
and a highly valued Russian asset.</i>

789
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:36,640
She was raised in the UK

790
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:40,705
and is currently in the employ of
one General Olag Konstantin.

791
00:55:40,804 --> 00:55:43,045
<i>He defected from Russia when the Wall fell</i>

792
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:47,178
<i>and is currently in charge of over
one-third of Bulgaria's armed forces.</i>

793
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:50,121
He is a staunch opponent
of his adopted army

794
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,660
being taken over by NATO and the EU.

795
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,120
<i>Holden, listen to me.</i>

796
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:58,223
<i>You and your team have got
to get to that key before he does.</i>

797
00:55:58,455 --> 00:56:01,493
This bastard hates Russia
as much as he does Europe.

798
00:56:02,058 --> 00:56:04,538
He gets the key, he'll start World War Ill.

799
00:56:05,161 --> 00:56:06,299
Are you ready?

800
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,674
This was
a Communist retreat for us Generals.

801
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:15,045
Party leaders.

802
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:18,541
Now it's falling apart.

803
00:56:20,076 --> 00:56:23,683
Most Russian special forces
once came from Bulgaria, did you know that?

804
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:28,192
No, man. I did not know that.

805
00:56:28,818 --> 00:56:31,389
This country was Moscow's little brother.

806
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:34,232
Now we are Europe's little sister.

807
00:56:34,324 --> 00:56:36,167
It's time to change that.

808
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:39,105
So, yes, I am ready.

809
00:56:40,997 --> 00:56:43,409
I've been ready for a long time.

810
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:47,408
Okay.

811
00:56:48,271 --> 00:56:49,716
Here we go.

812
00:56:54,444 --> 00:56:56,048
It has begun.

813
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:03,359
Backup power's on.

814
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:04,626
It's started.

815
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:07,224
Sir, the landline just went dead.

816
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,031
He cut off the cell towers.

817
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:10,537
Come on, get your ass
in there and do something.

818
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:11,901
He could be anywhere
on the planet right now!

819
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:14,567
We don't find the key,
there's nothing I can do.

820
00:57:14,631 --> 00:57:17,271
Okay. Hey, how many
tactical teams we got available right now?

821
00:57:17,367 --> 00:57:18,471
None.

822
00:57:18,902 --> 00:57:20,939
No. He just shut down the water!

823
00:57:21,037 --> 00:57:22,448
What can't he shut down?

824
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:25,713
DOD satellite and GPS.
Everything else he owns.

825
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:27,777
Good, good. Hey, I need a DOD phone.

826
00:57:27,877 --> 00:57:29,584
We've got a DOD link right here.

827
00:57:29,646 --> 00:57:31,592
- I need that.
- Here.

828
00:57:31,915 --> 00:57:33,417
Who's got it?

829
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:35,153
Yo?

830
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:37,959
I need you to tell me
everything you have on Teebs, okay?

831
00:57:38,054 --> 00:57:40,625
Dude, we got a boatload of photos of him
from the black hat presentation,

832
00:57:40,723 --> 00:57:42,603
but like I said,
he's got on a mask and glasses.

833
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:45,333
All right. Well, describe him to me.
Okay? Everything that you see.

834
00:57:45,428 --> 00:57:46,930
Dude, he's exactly what you would expect.

835
00:57:46,996 --> 00:57:49,408
Typical sideways hat wearing, neckbeard.

836
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:51,571
Vaping through some creepy skull bandanna.

837
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:53,076
Looks like the devil when he exhales.

838
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:55,878
Vape? Wait! Vaping? Stop.
Like an electronic cigarette?

839
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:58,350
No. It's like a little metal pipe.

840
00:57:58,441 --> 00:57:59,545
Like a vape pen?

841
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:01,315
<i>Yeah, yeah, something like that.</i>

842
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,459
All right, describe the vape pen.

843
00:58:04,681 --> 00:58:07,662
Man, I don't smoke.
What does this have to do with anything?

844
00:58:07,717 --> 00:58:10,197
Just keep describing it! What color is it?

845
00:58:10,353 --> 00:58:14,301
Silver, about the size of a cigar.
It's got like a, clown on...

846
00:58:15,124 --> 00:58:17,297
No, it's a skull. It's got
a skull on the front.

847
00:58:20,029 --> 00:58:21,565
Is the tip metal or plastic?

848
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:23,234
<i>Plastic.</i>

849
00:58:24,567 --> 00:58:25,978
What are you talking about?

850
00:58:26,035 --> 00:58:30,347
Teebs uses the skull head model
of an EK-928-C vaporizer. Okay?

851
00:58:30,406 --> 00:58:32,579
The only way you can
charge that thing is with a USB port.

852
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:35,588
Chinese manufacturers
put a back-door in everything.

853
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:38,386
So, I guarantee you that every time
he charges that son of a bitch,

854
00:58:38,581 --> 00:58:41,562
they track his location.
I just need to get into their mainframe.

855
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:47,095
I'm in.

856
00:58:48,725 --> 00:58:50,398
Tell me you got him.

857
00:58:50,493 --> 00:58:52,097
Who handles your GPS locations?

858
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,902
- Nadine? Nadine?
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

859
00:58:53,997 --> 00:58:55,340
Look at these numbers,

860
00:58:55,398 --> 00:58:58,345
just tell me any numbers that have
the same longitude and latitude.

861
00:58:58,401 --> 00:59:00,847
Yeah. It's this one, this one and that one.

862
00:59:00,904 --> 00:59:02,247
Okay, that's three. All right.

863
00:59:02,338 --> 00:59:05,080
That's a bakery in Odessa.

864
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,585
An apartment in Sumy.

865
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,286
And a power plant in Sofia.

866
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,882
I got him! I got him!

867
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:13,686
I got two teams flying in
from Germany right now.

868
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:15,150
I don't need your teams, man.

869
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:17,391
I have a team right here, ready to go.

870
00:59:18,688 --> 00:59:20,224
So, you picked us to fail.

871
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:22,451
But now you want us
to volunteer for a suicide mission?

872
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:25,930
There are no terms under
which I want to die.

873
00:59:26,529 --> 00:59:28,975
Yeah, no thanks. Bring in the A-Team.

874
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:30,772
Listen, I made a mistake.

875
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:32,577
Okay? I made a mistake!

876
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:34,774
I'm sorry, I...

877
00:59:35,371 --> 00:59:37,317
I don't have
a lot of experience dealing with...

878
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:39,148
- People?
- Yes. That, yes.

879
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:40,949
I misjudged you. Okay?

880
00:59:41,044 --> 00:59:42,785
Gloria, I looked at your records.

881
00:59:42,879 --> 00:59:46,952
And despite a negative psych eval
that says you're cold and heartless,

882
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:50,159
your field tests and your combat evals
were off the charts.

883
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:52,164
You were the top of your class. Okay?

884
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:55,725
And just because you have
this beautiful face,

885
00:59:56,726 --> 01:00:00,105
this pencil-pushing asshole decided
that you should be a swallow.

886
01:00:00,163 --> 01:00:01,972
And that's awful.

887
01:00:02,131 --> 01:00:04,111
But this is your decision, this one.

888
01:00:05,335 --> 01:00:07,110
Not some chauvinist in a suit.

889
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:11,618
So, come on.

890
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:13,981
Okay.

891
01:00:15,078 --> 01:00:17,149
- But I still hate you.
- That's fair.

892
01:00:17,647 --> 01:00:19,092
I'll work on that.

893
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:21,591
Fish,

894
01:00:22,018 --> 01:00:23,998
you're a goddamn
cyclone of death and destruction.

895
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:26,332
Yeah. Well...

896
01:00:26,422 --> 01:00:29,130
But you've been forced to conform.

897
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:32,605
But if we can harness that insanity,

898
01:00:32,662 --> 01:00:35,472
and then unleash it at the right moment,

899
01:00:35,531 --> 01:00:39,035
there's not an army
on the planet that can stand up to you.

900
01:00:42,772 --> 01:00:45,218
Fine. I'm in, too.

901
01:00:46,342 --> 01:00:48,788
It's only because
I can't walk away from a fight.

902
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,154
Dmitri, listen to me.
Listen to me, you son of a bitch.

903
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:56,657
Most people would disagree
with what I'm about to say,

904
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:58,323
people in this very room.

905
01:00:58,554 --> 01:01:02,366
But I'm gonna tell you right now,
you're the best damn wheelman in Europe.

906
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:04,232
Well...

907
01:01:07,296 --> 01:01:10,505
You're the only person
I trust to get us in and out of there.

908
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,838
No. No.

909
01:01:13,403 --> 01:01:15,644
No. I see what you are doing.

910
01:01:15,872 --> 01:01:17,818
It won't work.

911
01:01:17,874 --> 01:01:19,876
You people are crazy.

912
01:01:20,576 --> 01:01:22,578
Konstantin has an army.

913
01:01:23,146 --> 01:01:24,819
We are four people.

914
01:01:24,881 --> 01:01:26,087
We are five people.

915
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:31,028
I guess you guys need someone like me

916
01:01:31,087 --> 01:01:34,330
to figure out a way to get you
idiots in and out of there alive.

917
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:38,270
Great. So, in addition to me,
Russian special forces,

918
01:01:38,594 --> 01:01:40,096
we have nerd,

919
01:01:40,563 --> 01:01:41,940
a Mata Hari,

920
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:43,704
a mental patient

921
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:45,607
and old man.

922
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:55,580
And you're the Russian agent
that speaks Russian?

923
01:01:55,678 --> 01:01:57,851
- Yes.
- Wow.

924
01:01:59,115 --> 01:02:00,253
Where are your sneakers?

925
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:02,522
Why?

926
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:04,459
Well, I heard you run a lot.

927
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:05,760
He runs a lot.

928
01:02:10,293 --> 01:02:12,739
How'd you like
the old man's boot up your ass?

929
01:02:19,802 --> 01:02:22,715
I will at least drop you off.

930
01:02:27,276 --> 01:02:28,414
Hey. Hey.

931
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:40,257
I thought you might need this.

932
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,138
Thanks.

933
01:02:52,735 --> 01:02:54,510
You know how to use it, right?

934
01:02:55,638 --> 01:02:57,276
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

935
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:58,478
Put it away.

936
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:20,870
Fisher. I got you gift. It's in the trunk.

937
01:03:21,097 --> 01:03:23,134
That's messed up
because I didn't get you nothing.

938
01:03:23,366 --> 01:03:24,845
It's okay.

939
01:03:24,934 --> 01:03:26,436
An offer of peace and friendship,

940
01:03:26,502 --> 01:03:29,972
since we will most probably
not survive mission.

941
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:34,451
What is this? Some kind of jinx shit?

942
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:37,020
That's bad mojo, man, no way.

943
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:40,190
You slam the trunk, you damage the paint.

944
01:03:40,283 --> 01:03:41,785
You mean damage the rust.

945
01:03:42,285 --> 01:03:44,196
No presents before missions,

946
01:03:44,954 --> 01:03:47,332
especially when you say
you're giving it to me 'cause we might die.

947
01:03:47,523 --> 01:03:49,298
This present is lucky.

948
01:03:50,459 --> 01:03:52,700
You will want this present.

949
01:03:53,029 --> 01:03:55,532
Keep the stupid present.
I'll take it after the mission.

950
01:04:16,485 --> 01:04:18,556
Yo, this is some wimp shit right here.

951
01:04:18,988 --> 01:04:20,558
Why are we going in the back?

952
01:04:20,656 --> 01:04:22,602
Because Konstantin
has a small army out front,

953
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:25,195
and I can't hack
armored vehicles and AK-47s.

954
01:04:25,328 --> 01:04:26,705
What are we even
looking at, anyway?

955
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:28,838
The cooling outlet
for the gas turbines.

956
01:04:28,898 --> 01:04:30,206
It's the least guarded entrance.

957
01:04:30,266 --> 01:04:33,042
Well, someone's gotta
at least take out the guys guarding it.

958
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:35,880
All right. Go ahead. Get
it out of your system.

959
01:04:42,111 --> 01:04:44,557
Hey, Fisher, um...

960
01:04:46,249 --> 01:04:48,559
First of all, how's it going?

961
01:04:48,684 --> 01:04:49,856
Good.

962
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:54,467
I'm gonna tell you something that you're
probably not gonna like very much.

963
01:04:55,024 --> 01:04:58,301
I stole a peek at your personnel files.

964
01:05:00,196 --> 01:05:03,200
And you are not the best shot in the group.

965
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,409
No, no, not me. Her.

966
01:05:08,604 --> 01:05:10,641
- You're kidding?
- No, I'm not. Sorry.

967
01:05:22,451 --> 01:05:25,830
She might be good, but is she fast?
There's two guys.

968
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:28,960
She hits one, she's gotta hit
the other before he sounds the alarm.

969
01:05:44,206 --> 01:05:45,514
Holy...

970
01:05:52,515 --> 01:05:53,858
That was hot.

971
01:05:56,519 --> 01:05:57,827
I know.

972
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:09,970
Okay.

973
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:11,668
I have a signal. Pantheon is here,

974
01:06:11,734 --> 01:06:14,094
but it looks like
there's miles of tunnels under this thing.

975
01:06:25,014 --> 01:06:26,375
Listen. There's a door.

976
01:06:26,549 --> 01:06:28,229
All right. Let me take care of this chump.

977
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:30,763
Hey, Fisher!
Calm down, man. Not yet. All right?

978
01:06:30,853 --> 01:06:33,732
Listen for once.
Just be patient. Use your head.

979
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:35,598
How the hell do we get in?

980
01:06:35,691 --> 01:06:37,398
You're in uniform.

981
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:38,733
Dmitri?

982
01:06:49,372 --> 01:06:51,113
Come on, let's go!

983
01:06:51,374 --> 01:06:52,751
The next guy's mine.

984
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:58,784
All right.

985
01:06:58,881 --> 01:07:01,862
These guys right here, let's do 'em.

986
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:04,691
Calm down, Fisher.

987
01:07:04,954 --> 01:07:06,399
Just wait.

988
01:07:16,298 --> 01:07:18,141
All right, let's <i>split</i> up.

989
01:07:18,234 --> 01:07:21,113
<i>Grid search. Drew, Gloria, mid-level.</i>

990
01:07:21,404 --> 01:07:24,078
Fisher, Dmitri, basement.

991
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:25,744
How come I get the basement?

992
01:07:25,808 --> 01:07:28,550
<i>There's probably less people
for you to kill down there.</i>

993
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:32,720
This is bullshit.

994
01:07:32,782 --> 01:07:35,456
I gotta at least get me one guy.

995
01:07:42,792 --> 01:07:44,066
Hey.

996
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:14,261
This panel's ancient.

997
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:18,837
Old Soviet technology.

998
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:22,333
I bet I can hack into
the control room from here.

999
01:08:25,668 --> 01:08:26,942
Holy...

1000
01:08:27,803 --> 01:08:30,716
- Holden?
- Drew, what did you find?

1001
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:33,116
Teebs had Pantheon reroute
all the gas into the city.

1002
01:08:33,175 --> 01:08:36,255
It's gonna overload the system. The pipes
are gonna burst, the city's gonna...

1003
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:38,383
The city's gonna blow up.

1004
01:08:38,481 --> 01:08:41,690
<i>If they can blow up this city,
they can blow up anything, anywhere.</i>

1005
01:08:43,352 --> 01:08:44,854
We gotta find that key.

1006
01:08:52,661 --> 01:08:55,972
Hey, man.
Someone just hacked into your mainframe.

1007
01:08:57,299 --> 01:08:58,642
There's only one way to do that.

1008
01:08:58,701 --> 01:09:00,647
- Which is?
- Be in the building.

1009
01:09:00,836 --> 01:09:02,315
He's lying-

1010
01:09:02,371 --> 01:09:04,977
- I'm not the one who lies.
- Keep an eye on him.

1011
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:21,568
So, are you playing
the General, too? Or was it just me?

1012
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:25,169
No. Just you.

1013
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:39,612
Hey. What's that say, right there?

1014
01:09:40,576 --> 01:09:42,112
You can't read this?

1015
01:09:42,211 --> 01:09:43,690
Knife. Fork.

1016
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:46,692
It says this way to food place.

1017
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:48,927
Hells yeah!

1018
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:51,521
That means there's gonna be
a shit ton of guys in there.

1019
01:09:52,254 --> 01:09:53,858
Let me go in first and spray 'em.

1020
01:09:53,923 --> 01:09:55,129
Hey!

1021
01:09:55,257 --> 01:09:57,032
We have uniform.

1022
01:09:57,092 --> 01:10:00,073
I speak okay Bulgarian,
you don't have to shoot?

1023
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:02,202
Come on, man.
We're in the basement.

1024
01:10:02,264 --> 01:10:03,470
No one's gonna hear us.

1025
01:10:04,767 --> 01:10:05,939
He's mad.

1026
01:10:07,069 --> 01:10:09,071
Come on, man! Let's go!

1027
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:13,880
Damn it!

1028
01:10:15,811 --> 01:10:18,758
All right. We're going to the cafeteria.
If anyone's hungry, speak up.

1029
01:10:18,948 --> 01:10:20,269
<i>Quit the humor, will you?</i>

1030
01:10:20,316 --> 01:10:22,796
Take it nice and easy. No mistakes.

1031
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:26,094
Hey, yeah, I know, a stealth mission.
You suck the fun out of everything.

1032
01:10:35,664 --> 01:10:37,166
It's empty.

1033
01:10:37,266 --> 01:10:38,404
Shh!

1034
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,639
Cigarette's still burning.

1035
01:10:40,803 --> 01:10:43,010
Those scum-sucking pigs
are here somewhere.

1036
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:53,682
That is just plain weird.

1037
01:10:53,983 --> 01:10:55,826
It's like everyone just up and left.

1038
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:58,296
<i>Well, there's plenty
down here, Fisher, so stay off the com.</i>

1039
01:10:58,454 --> 01:11:00,627
Yeah, man. Calm down. Don't kill anyone.

1040
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:18,946
Guys, it's like
something's going on down here.

1041
01:11:19,041 --> 01:11:21,817
Like everyone
just disappeared all of a sudden.

1042
01:11:21,877 --> 01:11:22,981
Go.

1043
01:11:31,654 --> 01:11:34,533
It's kind of spooky
down here in the dungeon.

1044
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:37,194
I should have had to kill
at least one guy to be at this point.

1045
01:11:48,237 --> 01:11:49,477
What the hell?

1046
01:11:49,538 --> 01:11:52,348
<i>Fisher,
I just told you. Cut the chatter will you?</i>

1047
01:11:52,408 --> 01:11:55,150
Okay, looks like
a zombie movie down here.

1048
01:11:55,210 --> 01:11:59,181
There's half-eaten meals, warm coffee.
It's as creepy as shit.

1049
01:11:59,248 --> 01:12:01,008
<i>Just keep your
finger off the trigger</i>

1050
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:03,189
<i>so you don't blow your balls off.</i>

1051
01:12:03,252 --> 01:12:05,198
Why does everyone keep saying that to me?

1052
01:12:05,254 --> 01:12:07,825
I'm a trained professional, not an animal.

1053
01:12:30,646 --> 01:12:33,058
<i>Was that you Fisher?
What the hell was that?</i>

1054
01:12:35,084 --> 01:12:37,462
Good news, I got my 20.

1055
01:12:40,389 --> 01:12:41,766
And there's cake.

1056
01:12:44,226 --> 01:12:44,359
- What did he just say?
- I don't know, something about 20 cakes?

1057
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:47,000
- What did he just say?
- I don't know, something about 20 cakes?

1058
01:12:55,337 --> 01:12:56,782
Dmitri!

1059
01:13:08,283 --> 01:13:11,162
<i>Security breach, sub level, B6.</i>

1060
01:13:14,289 --> 01:13:16,132
I told you.

1061
01:13:17,192 --> 01:13:20,867
<i>Security breach, sub level, B6.</i>

1062
01:13:26,535 --> 01:13:28,378
Guys, I got bad news.

1063
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:29,949
Igor pulled the alarm.

1064
01:13:30,005 --> 01:13:31,348
<i>Who the hell is Igor?</i>

1065
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:33,044
The birthday boy.

1066
01:13:33,142 --> 01:13:34,815
Let's get out of here!

1067
01:13:55,197 --> 01:13:57,199
<i>System malfunction.</i>

1068
01:14:00,636 --> 01:14:02,081
<i>Pressure critical.</i>

1069
01:14:11,013 --> 01:14:13,254
<i>Twelve minutes to valve failure.</i>

1070
01:14:40,042 --> 01:14:41,578
Teebs!

1071
01:14:43,178 --> 01:14:45,385
It's him, he's got the key.

1072
01:14:45,514 --> 01:14:47,551
- Go, I'll keep him busy.
- Just be safe okay?

1073
01:14:53,021 --> 01:14:55,558
Teebs, stop. You don't
have to do this, man.

1074
01:14:55,624 --> 01:14:57,865
You're not a killer, okay, you're a hacker.

1075
01:14:58,193 --> 01:14:59,570
Just give me the key. We can stop this.

1076
01:14:59,628 --> 01:15:03,132
I'm a god with this.
You think I'm going to hand it over?

1077
01:15:03,232 --> 01:15:04,472
Please?

1078
01:15:08,103 --> 01:15:09,783
- You're going to shoot me?
- Back up, man.

1079
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:13,112
Um...

1080
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:46,478
<i>What happened?</i>

1081
01:15:48,343 --> 01:15:51,449
The key, it's destroyed.

1082
01:15:54,416 --> 01:15:57,420
Well, clear the hell out of there, will you?
Now! Just get out.

1083
01:15:57,586 --> 01:15:59,827
Holden, we can't clear out.

1084
01:16:00,022 --> 01:16:01,865
- Drew.
- Sir, we're losing them.

1085
01:16:01,957 --> 01:16:03,758
No, we can't get out, we
have to shut it down!

1086
01:16:03,759 --> 01:16:05,170
- Drew, I can't hear you.
- Holden!

1087
01:16:06,495 --> 01:16:08,941
- Holden!
- Sir, the signal dropped.

1088
01:16:09,965 --> 01:16:11,808
All right, get the RSO in here, will you?

1089
01:16:13,468 --> 01:16:14,948
I lost him, are you guys still there?

1090
01:16:15,103 --> 01:16:17,982
You heard the order, let's get out of here.

1091
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:20,042
No, we can't just leave,
we have to shut it down.

1092
01:16:20,142 --> 01:16:22,281
You said we can't without the key.

1093
01:16:22,344 --> 01:16:23,618
We can't, but if I can
get into the control room

1094
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:25,283
maybe we can hack the hardware.

1095
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:30,226
I don't hack, I blow shit up.

1096
01:16:30,652 --> 01:16:31,858
Okay, well, you guys create a diversion.

1097
01:16:31,954 --> 01:16:34,298
Gloria and I will get to the control room.

1098
01:16:35,223 --> 01:16:36,531
Roger that.

1099
01:16:39,227 --> 01:16:41,138
<i>Ten minutes to valve failure.</i>

1100
01:16:46,301 --> 01:16:49,009
It's going to get hairy. No pussing out.

1101
01:16:49,071 --> 01:16:50,709
I ain't pussing out, okay?

1102
01:16:50,806 --> 01:16:52,752
Look, I need to know you got my back.

1103
01:16:52,841 --> 01:16:56,152
Yeah, well, why are you climbing?
I don't like heights.

1104
01:16:56,211 --> 01:16:57,884
I thought you weren't going to puss out.

1105
01:16:57,980 --> 01:16:59,482
Yeah, I ain't no puss.

1106
01:17:00,749 --> 01:17:02,922
Set up a perimeter. I
want these men caught.

1107
01:17:03,752 --> 01:17:05,254
They are dressed in our uniforms

1108
01:17:05,354 --> 01:17:06,424
but I can ID them.

1109
01:17:07,222 --> 01:17:08,530
Hey, yo!

1110
01:17:09,157 --> 01:17:10,261
Check this out.

1111
01:17:10,359 --> 01:17:11,667
That's them! That's them!

1112
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:12,998
Heads up.

1113
01:17:43,191 --> 01:17:45,569
<i>Eight minutes to valve failure.</i>

1114
01:17:54,202 --> 01:17:58,651
It's an old control room.
Analog, not digital, not my specialty.

1115
01:18:02,744 --> 01:18:03,950
Okay.

1116
01:18:04,046 --> 01:18:05,252
Okay.

1117
01:18:09,251 --> 01:18:12,061
Okay, Pantheon is going to push as
much gas as possible into the city

1118
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:14,760
using pipe 718 here.

1119
01:18:14,823 --> 01:18:16,302
There's nothing we can do to change that,

1120
01:18:16,391 --> 01:18:18,632
but I might be able to spoof the hardware

1121
01:18:18,727 --> 01:18:20,968
by swapping out the
server control head lD's.

1122
01:18:21,997 --> 01:18:24,773
Right, what does that mean in English?

1123
01:18:27,602 --> 01:18:28,945
We need to hot-wire it.

1124
01:18:29,004 --> 01:18:31,006
Okay. What can I do to help?

1125
01:18:41,316 --> 01:18:44,593
Okay, so, we need to find
as many CAT 5 cables as possible.

1126
01:18:44,653 --> 01:18:50,433
Connect that panel over there
with this control board into that computer.

1127
01:18:50,926 --> 01:18:53,463
Great. What's a CAT 5 cable?

1128
01:19:03,271 --> 01:19:05,114
Close in. Get them!

1129
01:19:09,544 --> 01:19:11,285
Shit, I'm out of grenades.

1130
01:19:13,115 --> 01:19:15,959
Dmitri! Dmitri, get back here.

1131
01:19:16,284 --> 01:19:18,059
Commie bastard.

1132
01:19:19,287 --> 01:19:20,823
Hey, heads up.

1133
01:19:25,026 --> 01:19:26,505
Thank you.

1134
01:19:27,295 --> 01:19:29,138
So, theoretically, this should work.

1135
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:31,771
Theoretically?

1136
01:19:31,933 --> 01:19:33,276
In theory.

1137
01:19:33,368 --> 01:19:35,575
You say "theoretically" now.

1138
01:19:44,346 --> 01:19:45,882
So, how much longer
is this going to take?

1139
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:48,267
Well, I just need
to reset the router, but that takes time.

1140
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:51,389
<i>Hey, Drew,
that crazy Russian broad just got by me.</i>

1141
01:19:52,754 --> 01:19:54,392
She's kind of hot.

1142
01:19:57,292 --> 01:19:58,794
Let me go say hello.

1143
01:20:01,096 --> 01:20:03,076
<i>Six minutes to valve failure.</i>

1144
01:20:34,095 --> 01:20:36,302
That commie deserted us.

1145
01:20:36,398 --> 01:20:38,139
How much longer, Drew?
I'm running out of ammo.

1146
01:20:38,233 --> 01:20:40,193
<i>Just a few minutes,
keep up the distraction.</i>

1147
01:21:02,023 --> 01:21:03,696
Turn around!

1148
01:21:04,192 --> 01:21:06,638
Go ahead. Just do it.

1149
01:21:35,657 --> 01:21:37,068
Drew, are you almost done?

1150
01:21:38,793 --> 01:21:40,636
- Damn it.
<i>- I'll</i> take that as a no.

1151
01:21:40,695 --> 01:21:43,005
<i>- It needs a firmware update.</i>

1152
01:21:47,535 --> 01:21:48,673
This is going to take two minutes.

1153
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:50,777
<i>Doesn't this place
blow up in a few minutes?</i>

1154
01:22:05,654 --> 01:22:09,067
Drew, be careful',
I lost her. I think she went outside.

1155
01:22:11,226 --> 01:22:12,534
I thought you left me, man.

1156
01:22:12,594 --> 01:22:14,699
I had to get you present.

1157
01:22:15,397 --> 01:22:17,877
- What, that's for me?
- Bazooka time.

1158
01:22:18,333 --> 01:22:20,540
I didn't know Russians made bazookas.

1159
01:22:20,602 --> 01:22:22,707
We invented the bazooka.

1160
01:22:22,771 --> 01:22:25,047
There they are! Turn left!

1161
01:22:25,907 --> 01:22:27,284
Around the corner!

1162
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:29,081
Take cover!

1163
01:22:30,845 --> 01:22:32,415
Give me the shell.

1164
01:22:32,514 --> 01:22:35,688
It is Russian,
more difficult to fire. I will shoot...

1165
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:38,594
No, no, bullshit, man.
This is my present. You already got one.

1166
01:22:38,687 --> 01:22:40,462
Aiming this can be a little tricky.

1167
01:22:40,555 --> 01:22:42,796
Don't tell me about aim.
I was this close to being special forces.

1168
01:22:42,891 --> 01:22:44,393
- Come on.
- Big deal.

1169
01:22:47,028 --> 01:22:48,405
Attack! They are going to shoot!

1170
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:50,432
Bazooka time.

1171
01:23:00,041 --> 01:23:01,816
Okay, that went a little wide.

1172
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:03,651
You destroyed her.

1173
01:23:04,579 --> 01:23:07,617
Well, I'm sorry, man, collateral
damage. Just get me another shell.

1174
01:23:07,716 --> 01:23:09,252
Shells are in trunk.

1175
01:23:09,317 --> 01:23:11,077
You left the shells in the trunk?
What the...

1176
01:23:11,086 --> 01:23:13,293
Because you didn't want present.

1177
01:23:14,556 --> 01:23:17,162
Now is our chance... turn the gun!

1178
01:23:17,625 --> 01:23:20,799
I don't care anymore, car is dead.

1179
01:23:21,329 --> 01:23:23,809
Stop, stop, come here.

1180
01:23:24,232 --> 01:23:25,609
Look, if we're going to do this,

1181
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:28,011
we gotta be smart, we gotta use our heads.

1182
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:31,742
I've got a plan.
Follow me, come on, come on.

1183
01:23:33,808 --> 01:23:35,344
They're getting away!

1184
01:23:49,491 --> 01:23:52,335
<i>Drew, I'm not sure how much longer
I can hold her off.</i>

1185
01:23:52,427 --> 01:23:54,268
All right, I'm going to
try something, hang on.

1186
01:24:07,675 --> 01:24:11,646
Sorry, sorry,
that was the wrong wire, obviously.

1187
01:24:11,713 --> 01:24:13,283
It's got to be this guy right here.

1188
01:24:20,155 --> 01:24:21,498
What happened? That wasn't it.

1189
01:24:21,723 --> 01:24:25,193
Drew, are we going to blow up?
'Cause I'd kind of like to know.

1190
01:24:26,294 --> 01:24:28,672
There's really only one more of these.

1191
01:24:41,476 --> 01:24:43,149
<i>Come on, Drew.</i>

1192
01:24:43,211 --> 01:24:45,157
Yeah, I'm almost there.

1193
01:24:50,418 --> 01:24:52,329
<i>Two minutes to valve failure.</i>

1194
01:25:06,568 --> 01:25:07,945
You killed my car...

1195
01:25:09,037 --> 01:25:10,380
prepare to die!

1196
01:25:18,079 --> 01:25:19,786
Shoot... shoot now!

1197
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:27,900
Fisher!

1198
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:30,027
In the grass stop... stop!

1199
01:25:42,203 --> 01:25:43,807
Shalom, motherfucker.

1200
01:25:55,483 --> 01:25:56,621
Fisher!

1201
01:25:58,586 --> 01:25:59,826
I got me a tank!

1202
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:06,336
<i>Fifteen seconds to valve failure.</i>

1203
01:26:14,502 --> 01:26:16,140
<i>Ten seconds to valve failure.</i>

1204
01:26:22,443 --> 01:26:24,320
<i>Five seconds to valve failure.</i>

1205
01:26:34,189 --> 01:26:36,863
We did it. It worked.

1206
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:13,339
Hey, hey, what happened?

1207
01:27:13,394 --> 01:27:14,702
I just cut my thumb.

1208
01:27:18,266 --> 01:27:19,540
.L-Hey-.l-Hey-

1209
01:27:23,338 --> 01:27:27,115
Hey, Fisher, on com earlier,
you said something about cake, didn't you?
