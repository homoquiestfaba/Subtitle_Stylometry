Thanks.

367
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:29,749
And the view...

368
00:47:30,393 --> 00:47:32,001
Not bad for a thief.

369
00:47:33,102 --> 00:47:34,169
I'm not a thief.

370
00:47:35,646 --> 00:47:37,340
I've got a business, online.

371
00:47:39,692 --> 00:47:42,887
You mean... all this?

372
00:47:43,821 --> 00:47:44,822
Yeah.

373
00:47:44,824 --> 00:47:47,850
Like I do in the park but online.

374
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:52,887
You sell a lot?

375
00:47:53,289 --> 00:47:54,398
Sometimes.

376
00:48:08,888 --> 00:48:10,122
And so...

377
00:48:13,392 --> 00:48:14,877
what does the winner get?

378
00:48:16,187 --> 00:48:17,187
Nothing.

379
00:48:18,898 --> 00:48:20,508
Not when you win like that.

380
00:48:25,321 --> 00:48:27,932
- That doesn't seem fair.
- Fair?

381
00:48:30,076 --> 00:48:31,076

386

387
00:49:03,192 --> 00:49:04,192

389
00:50:47,338 --> 00:50:48,964
(Jean) When I was a little girl,

390
00:50:48,966 --> 00:50:53,285
my parents took me to Golden Gate Park
to play and have a picnic.

391
00:50:54,929 --> 00:50:56,856
It was my first time in the park,

392
00:50:56,858 --> 00:51:00,292
and I'd never seen
any place so beautiful.

393
00:51:01,435 --> 00:51:05,814
The huge trees that seemed even bigger
to me because I was so small

394
00:51:05,816 --> 00:51:08,008
swayed in the ocean breeze.

395
00:51:08,275 --> 00:51:11,445
There were flowers
and sharp colors everywhere.

396
00:51:11,737 --> 00:51:15,307
There were strange,
unknown birds flying above,

397
00:51:15,658 --> 00:51:18,324
and paper kites that floated on strings.

398
00:51:18,744 --> 00:51:22,748
A band played nearby,
and hundreds of people passed

399
00:51:23,082 --> 00:51:24,416
of all different types

400
00:51:24,418 --> 00:51:28,295
with different accents,
and languages, and faces,

401
00:51:28,504 --> 00:51:30,130
talking, and laughing,

402
00:51:30,339 --> 00:51:34,368
and walking dogs, and riding bicycles,
and eating ice cream.

403
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:39,472
My father gave me a small red ball,

404
00:51:39,474 --> 00:51:41,308
and we played together,

405
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:43,210
tossing it back and forth.

406
00:51:44,937 --> 00:51:48,647
For the first time, I had
a wonderful feeling of belonging,

407
00:51:48,649 --> 00:51:51,186
like my parents, and I, and everyone

408
00:51:51,188 --> 00:51:53,982
were swimming in a stream of golden light.

409
00:51:55,364 --> 00:51:57,099
The park was magic.

Where are you?

423
00:53:21,867 --> 00:53:22,934
(Jean) The park.

424

(Joni) Can I see you?

425
00:53:27,206 --> 00:53:28,206

don't feel obligated.

427
00:53:32,336 --> 00:53:35,823
(Joni) I'd just like
to talk to you, about things.

428
00:53:38,676 --> 00:53:39,743
(Jean) I don't know.

429
00:53:42,054 --> 00:53:43,831
I need to keep my mind clear.

430
00:53:45,766 --> 00:53:47,334

You're making me feel old.

438

You're not old at all.

they evicted my father

Just legal notices harassing him,
forcing him out.

548
01:03:05,408 --> 01:03:06,785
It's isolated where she walks.

549
01:03:06,787 --> 01:03:08,019
I don't...

550
01:03:08,995 --> 01:03:10,438
God, is this needed?

551
01:03:11,915 --> 01:03:13,859

if I can.

554
01:03:36,606 --> 01:03:38,800
There she is. The gray coat.

555
01:03:41,403 --> 01:03:43,221
And she does this on the same schedule?

556
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:45,307
Yeah, most days.

557
01:03:46,658 --> 01:03:49,978
She's helping with some kind
of tech planning and expansion.

558
01:03:57,168 --> 01:03:58,862
What about her downtown offices?

559
01:03:59,963 --> 01:04:01,781
She usually goes later in the day,

560
01:04:02,048 --> 01:04:03,617
but downtown, she's never alone.

Hi, there. Are we still on for tonight?

569
01:04:54,728 --> 01:04:57,520
(Jean) Absolutely. I bought a new dress.

570
01:04:57,522 --> 01:04:58,646
Fantastic.

571
01:04:58,981 --> 01:05:01,091
Are you sure I can't pick
you up at your place?

572
01:05:01,566 --> 01:05:03,276
(Jean) No, I've got a couple of errands.

573
01:05:03,278 --> 01:05:06,237
I'll meet you there. Seven, right?

574
01:05:06,239 --> 01:05:08,390

- Hi, it's Chris.
- (Tricia) Hi, Chris. What's up?

580
01:05:29,761 --> 01:05:32,847
We had a temp working for us
in the last year or so.

581
01:05:32,849 --> 01:05:36,142
Her name is Jean Nash.
Can you pull her records?

582
01:05:36,434 --> 01:05:37,627
(Tricia) Let me check.

583
01:05:42,607 --> 01:05:46,820
No, but if it was through an agency,
then we don't start a file.

584
01:05:46,822 --> 01:05:47,929
It's on a contract.

585
01:05:48,738 --> 01:05:50,198
Do you want me to call the agencies?

586
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:53,827
Wait a minute, we have people working
in our offices, and we don't have a file?

587
01:05:53,829 --> 01:05:56,246
(Tricia) No, they're employed
by the agencies.

588
01:05:56,248 --> 01:05:57,664
What about confidentiality issues?

589
01:05:57,666 --> 01:05:59,791
They're usually not involved
with anything sensitive.

590
01:05:59,793 --> 01:06:01,376
You can't be sure of exposure.

591
01:06:01,378 --> 01:06:03,336
(Tricia) No, but they are
licensed agencies.

592
01:06:03,338 --> 01:06:06,047
This is completely unacceptable!
How many people is this?

593
01:06:06,049 --> 01:06:09,367

Great.

598

600
01:08:11,841 --> 01:08:13,633
I feel like I'm talking too much.

Oh, I love it.

602

You've had some amazing success.

Come on, you're making me feel old again.

01:08:19,432 --> 01:08:21,207
No, stop saying that.

605
01:08:23,309 --> 01:08:24,710
You look incredible.

606
01:08:27,564 --> 01:08:29,048
You can succeed, too.

607
01:08:31,901 --> 01:08:33,469
You can do whatever you want.

01:08:34,362 --> 01:08:36,431
I need to set some goals.

You're inspiring me.

610
01:08:40,243 --> 01:08:43,870
I mean, how did you get into development?

611
01:08:43,872 --> 01:08:45,482
I don't know much about that.

612
01:08:46,666 --> 01:08:48,793
You know, I did a lot of stuff
before I came here

613
01:08:48,795 --> 01:08:51,821
in San José, in Sacramento.

614
01:08:53,965 --> 01:08:55,425
But it's opportunity.

615
01:08:56,050 --> 01:08:57,584
This is gold-rush time.

616
01:08:58,553 --> 01:09:04,726
You find places that can be transformed,
and you leverage what you have.

617
01:09:10,064 --> 01:09:12,592
Look, do you want to see my place?

618
01:09:13,943 --> 01:09:16,696
I just renovated, I've got some good wine,

619
01:09:16,987 --> 01:09:18,530
some party favors.

620
01:09:18,532 --> 01:09:20,140
Party favors?

621
01:09:21,367 --> 01:09:23,269
That's my goal. (chuckles)

622
01:09:24,578 --> 01:09:26,245
Or we could go to a club.

01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:29,192
You're driving. You choose.

No.

636
01:12:11,954 --> 01:12:12,996
I got it.

637
01:12:14,166 --> 01:12:15,208
What?

638
01:12:18,002 --> 01:12:19,002
I got it.

639

643

You didn't look disgusted
in the restaurant.

644
01:12:41,859 --> 01:12:45,112

645
01:12:45,114 --> 01:12:46,973

646
01:12:48,074 --> 01:12:50,200
I had to get into the fucking house.

647
01:12:50,202 --> 01:12:51,869
And I found drugs in your car.

or bring anything here.

Did you search the phone number?
