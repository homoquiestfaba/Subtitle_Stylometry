Thank you so much
for coming out.

20

This is absolutely amazing

28
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,896
'cause it means we did it.

29
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:29,028
We lived.

30
00:01:30,698 --> 00:01:31,437
I'm not gonna lie.

31
00:01:31,457 --> 00:01:34,896
I didn't think--
I didn't think I'd make it.

32
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:36,879
I didn't even get COVID.

33
00:01:36,899 --> 00:01:38,843
I'm just not a survivor.

34
00:01:38,863 --> 00:01:42,876
That's not how anybody
I know would describe me.

35
00:01:42,896 --> 00:01:46,287
I'll even tell you what, a year
before the pandemic, right?

36
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:49,698
Fully before the pandemic,
I was just walking in New York

37
00:01:49,718 --> 00:01:52,698
just looking up at the sky,
loving my life, right?

38
00:01:52,718 --> 00:01:54,445
Just looking up, being happy.

39
00:01:54,465 --> 00:01:56,173
And I stepped off the curb.

40
00:01:56,193 --> 00:01:59,028
That's all that's happened
so far.

41
00:01:59,048 --> 00:02:00,206
I stepped off the curb,

42
00:02:00,226 --> 00:02:03,678
and I stepped on a bird, okay?

43
00:02:03,698 --> 00:02:06,358
And here's the thing.
Not a dead bird, okay?

44
00:02:06,378 --> 00:02:08,107
This bird was also
walking around

45
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:11,995
not paying attention,
loving his life.

46
00:02:12,015 --> 00:02:14,358
We just collided with nature.

47
00:02:14,378 --> 00:02:16,239
Humanity at once.

48
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:17,716
And so I stepped on the bird.

49
00:02:17,736 --> 00:02:19,173
The bird and I freaked out,

50
00:02:19,193 --> 00:02:23,325
and the bird and I
made the same noise.

51
00:02:23,533 --> 00:02:27,632
That is not somebody that
survives a global pandemic,

52
00:02:27,652 --> 00:02:28,239
all right?

53
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:31,094
If you can match the pitch
of a pigeon out of fear,

54
00:02:31,114 --> 00:02:33,209
then no,
no one is checking for you

55
00:02:33,229 --> 00:02:35,305
in the "Mad Max" movie,
all right?

56
00:02:35,325 --> 00:02:38,863
You died in the first
five seconds in that montage

57
00:02:38,883 --> 00:02:40,797
about what went wrong
with the world.

58
00:02:40,817 --> 00:02:42,731
It's just you and a bird like--
[squawks]

59
00:02:42,751 --> 00:02:46,391
Like that's how it ends.

60
00:02:47,325 --> 00:02:50,226
This is insane, you know?

61
00:02:50,246 --> 00:02:51,371
Global pandemic.

62
00:02:51,391 --> 00:02:54,731
Last year was crazy
'cause this was the first thing

63
00:02:54,751 --> 00:02:58,061
that ever happened
that happened to everybody.

64
00:02:58,081 --> 00:02:59,107
That's wild.

65
00:02:59,127 --> 00:03:01,929
That didn't even happen
in the World Wars,

66
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:05,424
and they're named
after the world,

67
00:03:05,444 --> 00:03:06,041
you know?

68
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:07,666
There were some countries like,
"We good.

69
00:03:07,686 --> 00:03:09,272
"We're just going
to sit out this one.

70
00:03:09,292 --> 00:03:13,962
"Y'all seem to be working
a thing out over there, so...

71
00:03:13,982 --> 00:03:14,744
"We kinda little.

72
00:03:14,764 --> 00:03:18,896
We don't need
to be dusted up in that."

73
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:19,437
You know?

74
00:03:19,457 --> 00:03:22,193
Some people thought
it was the end of the world,

75
00:03:22,213 --> 00:03:24,391
which is why
I'm pretty sure that

76
00:03:24,411 --> 00:03:26,173
in all that chaos,

77
00:03:26,193 --> 00:03:28,160
in all that uncertainty,

78
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,744
in all that fear,

79
00:03:29,764 --> 00:03:34,226
somebody somewhere, definitely

80
00:03:34,246 --> 00:03:35,711
ate a person.

81
00:03:35,731 --> 00:03:37,404
That happened, all right?

82
00:03:37,424 --> 00:03:40,183
And we need to talk
about it, okay?

83
00:03:40,203 --> 00:03:42,962
It's more likely
that it happened

84
00:03:42,982 --> 00:03:45,008
than that it didn't happen.

85
00:03:45,028 --> 00:03:47,518
You can't tell me out
of 7 billion people,

86
00:03:47,538 --> 00:03:50,707
nobody was strong enough
and dumb enough

87
00:03:50,727 --> 00:03:53,896
not to eat somebody
too quick, okay?

88
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,600
This dude's getting arrested
this year, like,

89
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,061
"Okay, I'm the only one
who ate somebody.

90
00:03:59,081 --> 00:04:00,094
"A'ight.

91
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:01,107
"I'm going.

92
00:04:01,127 --> 00:04:02,272
"How was I supposed
to know next year

93
00:04:02,292 --> 00:04:05,160
"there'd still be
Cap'n Crunch, all right?

94
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:05,876
"I'm going.

95
00:04:05,896 --> 00:04:07,325
"Can I just say
something though?

96
00:04:07,345 --> 00:04:10,292
"Can I just say something?

97
00:04:10,312 --> 00:04:13,239
"Nobody even liked Dave, okay?

98
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:15,226
"That's why it took y'all
so long to catch him.

99
00:04:15,246 --> 00:04:16,495
"Nobody was checking for Dave.

100
00:04:16,515 --> 00:04:18,162
"Look, I'm going.
I'm going.

101
00:04:18,182 --> 00:04:19,810
"Nobody was checking for Dave.

102
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:20,975
"Come on.
Can I say something else?

103
00:04:20,995 --> 00:04:24,424
"Can I just-- can I just say
something else real quick?

104
00:04:24,444 --> 00:04:25,371
"He was a little gamey.

105
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:28,206
"He was a little dry, all right?

106
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,810
"So now I gotta go
to jail off a meal

107
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,896
"that wasn't even good off
of a dude that nobody liked.

108
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:35,896
"Where's the justice?

109
00:04:36,764 --> 00:04:39,995
"He was a one-star meal
and person, all right?

110
00:04:40,015 --> 00:04:42,797
I'm going, I said."

111
00:04:45,542 --> 00:04:46,644
The thing that bothers me now

112
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,712
is that now
that there's vaccines

113
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:51,382
and, you know,
there's whole game plans

114
00:04:51,448 --> 00:04:53,050
for how we're going
to attack this thing,

115
00:04:53,117 --> 00:04:55,786
there are people that want
to act like they knew

116
00:04:55,853 --> 00:04:59,323
it was going to be okay
the entire time.

117
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,659
They wanna act like they were
cool the whole time,

118
00:05:01,725 --> 00:05:03,127
and that bothers me.

119
00:05:03,193 --> 00:05:05,696
It makes me mad, you know?

120
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,231
Doctors were like,

121
00:05:07,298 --> 00:05:09,300
"We've never seen anything
like this before, all right?"

122
00:05:09,366 --> 00:05:11,969
And you were like,
"No, I think it'll be fine."

123
00:05:12,036 --> 00:05:13,570
No, that's not true.

124
00:05:13,637 --> 00:05:16,807
Everybody was at least
a little bit panicked.

125
00:05:16,874 --> 00:05:19,276
And you know how I know that?

126
00:05:19,343 --> 00:05:22,680
Remember that food run in March?

127
00:05:23,447 --> 00:05:24,982
Remember that food run
where people thought

128
00:05:25,049 --> 00:05:27,384
it was the end of the world?

129
00:05:27,451 --> 00:05:31,221
And they ran past the food
to the toilet paper.

130
00:05:35,859 --> 00:05:37,595
They thought we were
all gonna die,

131
00:05:37,661 --> 00:05:40,297
and they ran past
the cheese snacks

132
00:05:40,364 --> 00:05:42,166
to what they were going
to wipe their butt with.

133
00:05:42,232 --> 00:05:45,970
There's never been a better ad
for a bidet.

134
00:05:47,471 --> 00:05:50,307
[cheers and applause]

135
00:05:52,376 --> 00:05:54,545
There's never been
a better ad for a bidet

136
00:05:54,612 --> 00:05:56,380
than a soccer mom

137
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,383
punching an old lady
in the face for some Charmin.

138
00:05:59,483 --> 00:06:00,951
She hits the ground.

139
00:06:01,018 --> 00:06:02,253
Lady's running with it
under her arm.

140
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,489
Even the mascot bear's like,
"Ooh."

141
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:07,258
You know?

142
00:06:07,324 --> 00:06:09,393
But you knew it would be okay.

143
00:06:09,493 --> 00:06:11,061
Come on.

144
00:06:11,128 --> 00:06:14,231
I knew some people
that were quarantined

145
00:06:14,298 --> 00:06:17,868
with their whole family
the entire time, you know?

146
00:06:17,935 --> 00:06:19,570
Like seven people in, like,

147
00:06:19,637 --> 00:06:22,506
a two-bedroom house.

148
00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:25,376
Oof.

149
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:26,911
Let's say it happens.

150
00:06:26,977 --> 00:06:28,913
Society crumbles.

151
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:30,814
The infrastructure fails.

152
00:06:30,881 --> 00:06:32,816
It's time to start
eating people.

153
00:06:34,518 --> 00:06:36,220
There are people
that were just looking

154
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:39,256
at their fattest cousin like,
"It's gonna be you, all right?

155
00:06:41,825 --> 00:06:42,993
"What you gonna do?
Run?

156
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,363
"No, it's too late for that,
all right?

157
00:06:46,463 --> 00:06:49,967
Plus he diabetic, so I know
he going to be sweet, okay?"

158
00:06:52,336 --> 00:06:53,737
I like how that was
a line for you.

159
00:06:53,804 --> 00:06:55,839
We've been eating people
for four minutes straight--

160
00:06:55,906 --> 00:06:57,141
of eating people jokes,

161
00:06:57,207 --> 00:07:00,044
and diabetic was where
you were like, "Ooh.

162
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,482
Not if they taste like cake."

163
00:07:08,085 --> 00:07:10,554
The pandemic definitely--

164
00:07:10,621 --> 00:07:12,623
it definitely made me glad

165
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,792
that I...

166
00:07:14,858 --> 00:07:17,494
grew up Black in America.

167
00:07:17,561 --> 00:07:19,496
You know what I mean?

168
00:07:19,563 --> 00:07:22,099
[cheers and applause]

169
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:25,502
'Cause nothing prepares you
for a pandemic in America

170
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:29,506
like being Black
in regular America.

171
00:07:29,573 --> 00:07:32,042
You know what I mean?

172
00:07:32,109 --> 00:07:33,490
Just sitting there like, what?

173
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,945
Wait, wait, wait.
What's that you say?

174
00:07:35,012 --> 00:07:36,180
Food is scarce,

175
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,648
medical attention
is hard to come by,

176
00:07:37,715 --> 00:07:38,849
and jobs in the community

177
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,584
are being lost by the thousands?

178
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:45,155
What is this?
A Tuesday?

179
00:07:45,222 --> 00:07:48,439
You know what I mean?

180
00:07:48,459 --> 00:07:50,995
Even now-- even now
that we have a vaccine,

181
00:07:51,061 --> 00:07:52,896
and there's a light
at the end of the tunnel,

182
00:07:52,963 --> 00:07:55,132
there's a lot Black people
that don't want to take it.

183
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,701
And I understand.
I do get it.

184
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,336
They don't want to take it

185
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,205
'cause of history,
you know what I mean?

186
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,674
Like, it's just not
on science's side.

187
00:08:03,741 --> 00:08:07,478
We've been experimented on
before, and we remember.

188
00:08:07,511 --> 00:08:11,148
But I will say
I'm fully vaccinated.

189
00:08:11,215 --> 00:08:14,385
[cheers and applause]

190
00:08:16,353 --> 00:08:18,088
That's the first time anybody's
clapped for my asthma.

191
00:08:18,155 --> 00:08:20,791
That is incredible.

192
00:08:20,858 --> 00:08:22,893
Okay.
I'll take it.

193
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,028
But I am fully vaccinated.

194
00:08:24,094 --> 00:08:26,196
And I would tell
all the Black people

195
00:08:26,263 --> 00:08:28,299
that I know in my life
and out of it,

196
00:08:28,365 --> 00:08:30,367
that this is the one to get.

197
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:32,503
And I know it's the one to get

198
00:08:32,536 --> 00:08:35,539
'cause they didn't want
to give it to us right away.

199
00:08:39,643 --> 00:08:40,778
Don't get me wrong.

200
00:08:40,844 --> 00:08:42,546
If you're just out
playing basketball

201
00:08:42,613 --> 00:08:44,615
and some white men in white
coats just walk up like,

202
00:08:44,682 --> 00:08:48,185
"Would you kids like
some free medicine?"

203
00:08:48,252 --> 00:08:50,688
Then yeah, no, no.

204
00:08:50,754 --> 00:08:52,456
Back away.

205
00:08:52,489 --> 00:08:53,958
But there were whole states
that were like,

206
00:08:54,024 --> 00:08:55,225
"Wait your turn, nigger."

207
00:08:55,292 --> 00:08:58,462
That's how you know
it's the good stuff.

208
00:09:03,033 --> 00:09:05,669
I'm sorry about the truth.

209
00:09:05,736 --> 00:09:07,972
I don't know what to tell you.

210
00:09:08,038 --> 00:09:11,141
[cheers and applause]

211
00:09:16,113 --> 00:09:19,483
But yeah, I-- I know
last year was scary.

212
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,118
It was.

213
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:23,053
'Cause some people's--

214
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,856
some people's worst fears
came true last year.

215
00:09:25,923 --> 00:09:28,525
There's some people
whose worst fear

216
00:09:28,592 --> 00:09:30,160
in their entire life

217
00:09:30,227 --> 00:09:31,495
is losing their job

218
00:09:31,562 --> 00:09:33,697
and not being able to provide
for their family,

219
00:09:33,764 --> 00:09:35,199
and that happened.

220
00:09:35,266 --> 00:09:37,301
There's some people
whose worst fear

221
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:40,004
in their entire life

222
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,006
is getting sick
and being a burden

223
00:09:42,072 --> 00:09:43,707
on the people that they love,

224
00:09:43,774 --> 00:09:45,676
and that happened.

225
00:09:45,743 --> 00:09:48,545
I had my worst fear
in my entire life

226
00:09:48,612 --> 00:09:51,348
come true last year.

227
00:09:51,448 --> 00:09:54,451
I got a bee stuck in my hair.

228
00:10:00,457 --> 00:10:02,159
I know it doesn't sound like
it matches up,

229
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:05,162
but let me explain.

230
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:08,165
First of all,
I am deathly allergic, okay?

231
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:10,501
I'm dea-- if I get stung,
I will die.

232
00:10:10,567 --> 00:10:13,103
Me plus bee equals dead, okay?

233
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:14,772
That's the quick math for you.

234
00:10:14,838 --> 00:10:17,341
And this thing came in hot,
all right?

235
00:10:17,474 --> 00:10:19,543
It shot in my hair
like it belonged there.

236
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:22,346
And at first, I just tried
to whip my hair back and forth.

237
00:10:22,479 --> 00:10:24,148
Tried to get it out.
That didn't help at all.

238
00:10:24,214 --> 00:10:26,650
It just got it more stuck.

239
00:10:26,717 --> 00:10:28,919
So now I am running up
to people screaming for help,

240
00:10:28,986 --> 00:10:31,755
but there is no quicker way
to look schizophrenic

241
00:10:31,822 --> 00:10:34,525
than running up to people
screaming for help,

242
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:37,361
and they can't see the threat,
all right?

243
00:10:40,164 --> 00:10:41,966
So now I'm running up
to white people

244
00:10:42,032 --> 00:10:45,069
in the park
ruining picnics, okay?

245
00:10:46,203 --> 00:10:48,072
I am stepping in people's pesto.

246
00:10:48,138 --> 00:10:50,474
I'm slipping in hummus.

247
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:54,278
I fell and snapped
a whole charcuterie board.

248
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,481
And I know what
I should have done.

249
00:10:57,548 --> 00:10:58,849
I should have--
I should have run up,

250
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:00,317
and I should've been like,
"Hey, I'm so sorry,

251
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:01,685
"but if I could get
your attention

252
00:11:01,752 --> 00:11:03,754
"for just a second,
there's a bee in my hair,

253
00:11:03,821 --> 00:11:04,788
"and I'm deathly allergic.

254
00:11:04,855 --> 00:11:06,090
"If you could help me out,

255
00:11:06,156 --> 00:11:08,559
that would be
a literal lifesaver, okay?"

256
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,795
I was too panicked
for any of that, all right?

257
00:11:11,862 --> 00:11:15,199
So I just ran up on 'em like,
"It's in me!

258
00:11:24,241 --> 00:11:27,878
"Can't you hear it?

259
00:11:27,945 --> 00:11:30,714
It's gonna kill me!"

260
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,185
And I forgot to mention up top

261
00:11:35,252 --> 00:11:36,687
that when I slipped
in the hummus,

262
00:11:36,754 --> 00:11:40,471
I rolled my ankle, so...

263
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:43,327
I didn't even get
to run up on the regular.

264
00:11:43,394 --> 00:11:46,664
I was running up,
I'm like, "It's in me!

265
00:11:48,032 --> 00:11:50,434
"Can't you hear it?

266
00:11:50,467 --> 00:11:53,504
It's gonna kill me!"

267
00:11:54,705 --> 00:11:56,140
People were running away
from me.

268
00:11:56,206 --> 00:11:57,942
It was terrible.

269
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:00,778
It was absolutely horrible.

270
00:12:00,844 --> 00:12:03,314
And this is the thing-- thing
that bothered me the most--

271
00:12:03,447 --> 00:12:06,317
the thing that really
stressed me out--

272
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,485
even broke my heart
a little bit--

273
00:12:08,552 --> 00:12:11,255
was this was the one time--
the one time

274
00:12:11,322 --> 00:12:14,325
in my entire life

275
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,360
that I needed white people
to touch my hair,

276
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,529
and they were nowhere
to be found.

277
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:26,136
I wasn't asking.
I was begging.

278
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,871
I was like, "I'm gonna die!"

279
00:12:27,938 --> 00:12:29,707
And they were like,
"No, no, I know better.

280
00:12:29,773 --> 00:12:31,275
"I learned about this,
all right?

281
00:12:31,342 --> 00:12:32,509
"I went to Vassar.

282
00:12:32,576 --> 00:12:34,178
"You're not going
to get me canceled.

283
00:12:34,245 --> 00:12:35,879
"I took a sensitivity class.

284
00:12:35,946 --> 00:12:37,881
Where's the Twitter?"

285
00:12:42,484 --> 00:12:43,886
Oh.

286
00:12:43,952 --> 00:12:46,021
I developed a lot of pet peeves

287
00:12:46,088 --> 00:12:48,624
in the pandemic, you know?

288
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,459
A lot of things that
didn't bother me before

289
00:12:50,525 --> 00:12:52,694
that definitely bother me now.

290
00:12:52,761 --> 00:12:54,630
Really upset me.

291
00:12:54,696 --> 00:12:56,365
Like, um...

292
00:12:56,431 --> 00:12:58,867
I'm done with horoscopes.

293
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:04,439
You can read yours
but don't read me mine, okay?

294
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,576
And I say I'm done because

295
00:13:07,643 --> 00:13:10,479
they're too esoteric for me,
you know?

296
00:13:10,545 --> 00:13:12,714
"You'll find love
in love's place

297
00:13:12,781 --> 00:13:15,317
when love's ready
to do love's thing."

298
00:13:17,085 --> 00:13:18,754
You think?

299
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,055
Wow.

300
00:13:20,122 --> 00:13:21,390
You basically just said

301
00:13:21,456 --> 00:13:22,925
something's going
to happen eventually.

302
00:13:22,991 --> 00:13:25,661
That's your prediction.

303
00:13:26,962 --> 00:13:28,797
I would just rather horoscope
with less words.

304
00:13:28,864 --> 00:13:30,032
That would make me happier.

305
00:13:30,098 --> 00:13:31,533
I would rather open up
a newspaper,

306
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,135
go down to where it says Pisces,

307
00:13:33,201 --> 00:13:34,636
and it just says, "Don't."

308
00:13:34,703 --> 00:13:38,340
I'm sure I was going to do
something dumb that day.

309
00:13:42,077 --> 00:13:44,346
The other reason
I'm done with them

310
00:13:44,446 --> 00:13:46,181
is because, you know...

311
00:13:46,248 --> 00:13:47,783
[scoffs]

312
00:13:49,351 --> 00:13:51,887
Everybody here was born.

313
00:13:51,954 --> 00:13:53,689
Everybody here's got a sign

314
00:13:53,755 --> 00:13:55,023
whether you believe
in it or not.

315
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:57,793
Everyone has one, right?

316
00:13:57,859 --> 00:14:02,631
How did everybody's horoscope
miss a global pandemic?

317
00:14:02,698 --> 00:14:05,500
It was coming whether you
were, like, a Leo or a Libra

318
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,736
or, like, the scales
or the-- the-- the dolphin

319
00:14:07,803 --> 00:14:11,073
and the-- the dog,
whatever it is.

320
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:12,474
It was coming no matter what.

321
00:14:12,507 --> 00:14:14,376
So I still have people
who have the nerve

322
00:14:14,476 --> 00:14:16,111
to read me my horoscope
and, like,

323
00:14:16,178 --> 00:14:18,547
"It says something very special
is on the way for you."

324
00:14:18,614 --> 00:14:19,881
Really?

325
00:14:19,948 --> 00:14:23,185
It couldn't have said,
"Mask up March 15th?"

326
00:14:23,252 --> 00:14:25,854
That would have
still been mysterious.

327
00:14:31,293 --> 00:14:33,996
I...

328
00:14:34,062 --> 00:14:37,266
I had a hard time in lockdown.

329
00:14:37,332 --> 00:14:40,636
I really did.
In quarantine, it was hard.

330
00:14:40,702 --> 00:14:44,172
It was really, really hard
because it--

331
00:14:44,239 --> 00:14:46,675
it made a liar out of me.

332
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,611
It did.

333
00:14:49,678 --> 00:14:53,448
'Cause I've always said,
my entire life...

334
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:57,753
If I just had the time.

335
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,494
Oh, if I had the time,

336
00:15:05,561 --> 00:15:08,931
I'd learn another language.

337
00:15:08,997 --> 00:15:11,099
I'd get ripped.

338
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:12,568
I'd learn how to build a house.

339
00:15:12,634 --> 00:15:15,470
Turns out, if you lock me
in my room for nine months,

340
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:18,574
I won't do any of those things.

341
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:26,848
I would just rather watch TV

342
00:15:26,915 --> 00:15:29,685
until I fall asleep
in succession.

343
00:15:30,485 --> 00:15:33,155
I watched TV and fell asleep
so many times

344
00:15:33,222 --> 00:15:35,057
that the only way
that I knew if I ate

345
00:15:35,123 --> 00:15:38,660
was if I woke up
with Dorito dust on my collar.

346
00:15:39,928 --> 00:15:41,930
I was just waking up
middle of the day just--

347
00:15:41,997 --> 00:15:43,632
[gasping for air]

348
00:15:43,699 --> 00:15:45,534
Oh.
Oh, thank God.

349
00:15:45,601 --> 00:15:47,903
Oh.

350
00:15:49,905 --> 00:15:51,440
My-- that became my life.

351
00:15:51,506 --> 00:15:54,309
My life just became
screens nonstop.

352
00:15:54,443 --> 00:15:55,544
It was either my phone

353
00:15:55,611 --> 00:15:58,046
or my computer or my TV nonstop.

354
00:15:58,113 --> 00:16:00,549
I was either on the internet
or I was watching something.

355
00:16:00,616 --> 00:16:02,851
And it got to be a lot.

356
00:16:02,918 --> 00:16:06,255
It got to the point
where I knew I needed

357
00:16:06,321 --> 00:16:09,224
to take a break, you know?

358
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,760
So I decided to do it.
I put-- I put everything down.

359
00:16:11,827 --> 00:16:14,897
I turned everything off,
and I just sat in my room

360
00:16:14,963 --> 00:16:17,799
and I would just sit,
and I would think.

361
00:16:17,866 --> 00:16:20,535
Just try to be alone
with myself in a quiet place.

362
00:16:20,602 --> 00:16:22,104
Like suss myself out,

363
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,106
get to know
what I'm really about in here.

364
00:16:24,172 --> 00:16:25,240
And that...

365
00:16:25,307 --> 00:16:28,243
was a terrible mistake.

366
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,458
It was.

367
00:16:29,478 --> 00:16:30,812
It was a terrible-- it was the--

368
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:33,081
one of the dumbest things
I've ever done in my life.

369
00:16:33,148 --> 00:16:34,583
First of all,

370
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,608
I'm just sitting, thinking.

371
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:38,587
I'm not thinking after reading.

372
00:16:38,654 --> 00:16:41,723
I'm just thinking
raw-ass thoughts.

373
00:16:43,058 --> 00:16:44,259
These aren't good thoughts.

374
00:16:44,326 --> 00:16:45,594
These are just things
I'd normally

375
00:16:45,661 --> 00:16:49,064
be too distracted
by TV to think.

376
00:16:49,131 --> 00:16:51,199
And they were real dumb.

377
00:16:51,266 --> 00:16:52,968
And that was heartbreaking.

378
00:16:53,035 --> 00:16:54,202
It was.

379
00:16:54,269 --> 00:16:55,871
I always thought
if I just sat and thought,

380
00:16:55,938 --> 00:16:57,506
I'd come up with a theory
or something.

381
00:16:57,573 --> 00:16:58,807
And I was just
sitting there, like,

382
00:16:58,874 --> 00:17:00,442
"Oh, my God.
All of these things are dumb.

383
00:17:00,475 --> 00:17:02,344
"Am I dumb?

384
00:17:02,444 --> 00:17:05,480
"Is this how
dumb people find out?

385
00:17:08,116 --> 00:17:10,052
"'Cause that last thing
was real dumb,

386
00:17:10,118 --> 00:17:12,921
and I'm the only one talking."

387
00:17:16,725 --> 00:17:19,628
That's what happens when
you sit with your thoughts.

388
00:17:21,029 --> 00:17:23,065
But I knew
I had to take a break.

389
00:17:23,131 --> 00:17:25,634
I knew it because

390
00:17:25,701 --> 00:17:28,770
I got to the point where

391
00:17:28,837 --> 00:17:32,241
I wasn't sure
if I knew who I was

392
00:17:32,307 --> 00:17:35,110
when there wasn't a screen
in front of my face,

393
00:17:35,177 --> 00:17:36,678
you know?

394
00:17:36,745 --> 00:17:39,681
Because I know
it sounds bad to say,

395
00:17:39,748 --> 00:17:42,751
but there's an online me,
and there's an in-person me.

396
00:17:42,818 --> 00:17:44,486
And I know it sounds fake
to say that,

397
00:17:44,553 --> 00:17:47,856
but it's true, you know?

398
00:17:47,923 --> 00:17:51,493
And I'm scared that
the online version is better.

399
00:17:52,794 --> 00:17:56,565
I am because online, I try to--

400
00:17:56,632 --> 00:17:58,700
I try to educate people,
you know?

401
00:17:58,767 --> 00:18:01,803
I-- I take up for people
that I don't know.

402
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:05,040
I fight for causes
that I believe in.

403
00:18:05,107 --> 00:18:06,909
But in real life,

404
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,844
I saw my friend, Sean,
get jumped,

405
00:18:08,911 --> 00:18:10,479
and I was like,
"He probably did something.

406
00:18:10,545 --> 00:18:12,547
"Uh...

407
00:18:15,317 --> 00:18:18,854
"I don't see how that's
my business, you know?

408
00:18:18,921 --> 00:18:20,355
"Honestly,
it wouldn't be three of them

409
00:18:20,455 --> 00:18:23,759
"if he didn't do it-- if he
didn't deserve it, you know?

410
00:18:23,825 --> 00:18:25,060
"In fact, let me turn around.

411
00:18:25,127 --> 00:18:28,230
"I don't like him
screaming my name like that.

412
00:18:28,297 --> 00:18:31,934
I don't want to be involved."

413
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,935
You know?

414
00:18:33,001 --> 00:18:34,970
Online, I try to educate people

415
00:18:35,037 --> 00:18:37,472
that I feel like
are being ignorant.

416
00:18:37,539 --> 00:18:39,808
But you know what I don't do
in real life?

417
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:40,976
Read!

418
00:18:41,043 --> 00:18:42,778
Like, I don't know
where I get off

419
00:18:42,844 --> 00:18:44,780
talking down to people.

420
00:18:44,846 --> 00:18:47,516
'Cause I got a keyboard
in front of me.

421
00:18:49,017 --> 00:18:51,153
Online,
I tell people I don't know

422
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:54,890
to keep following their dream,
okay?

423
00:18:54,957 --> 00:18:56,258
I tell them that they can do it.

424
00:18:56,325 --> 00:18:57,626
I don't know if they can do it.

425
00:18:57,693 --> 00:19:01,230
I keep telling them
that they can do it, okay?

426
00:19:01,296 --> 00:19:02,531
And in real life,

427
00:19:02,598 --> 00:19:05,634
I gave a street performer
money to stop.

428
00:19:08,704 --> 00:19:11,306
I was online,

429
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,108
and I saw this guy

430
00:19:13,175 --> 00:19:15,744
making fun of this kid
for being too skinny

431
00:19:15,811 --> 00:19:17,246
'cause he posted
a workout video,

432
00:19:17,312 --> 00:19:19,448
and there was this big dude
making fun of him, right?

433
00:19:19,481 --> 00:19:20,582
And so I told him, "Hey.

434
00:19:20,649 --> 00:19:22,217
"If you want to get
your ass beat,

435
00:19:22,284 --> 00:19:24,553
come to this address."

436
00:19:28,023 --> 00:19:30,592
And in real life, I gave him
my buddy Sean's address.

437
00:19:30,659 --> 00:19:33,862
See what I mean?
Like...

438
00:19:33,929 --> 00:19:35,130
how was I supposed to know

439
00:19:35,197 --> 00:19:36,598
he was gonna bring
two other people?

440
00:19:36,665 --> 00:19:38,934
That's just unfair.

441
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,080
'Cause I'm also relearning

442
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,542
how to be in the world,
you know?

443
00:19:45,562 --> 00:19:49,935
I was awkward before,
but I'm insufferable now.

444
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:50,509
I am.

445
00:19:50,529 --> 00:19:54,803
I am almost a year out
of practice from being weird.

446
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:58,410
Like, I go-- I go--
I go on walks,

447
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:02,463
and I remember I left the house
for this walk, right?

448
00:20:02,483 --> 00:20:05,661
And while I was on it,
I bumped into a guy.

449
00:20:05,681 --> 00:20:06,816
And we bumped
into each other hard

450
00:20:06,836 --> 00:20:09,001
'cause we both just weren't
paying attention.

451
00:20:09,021 --> 00:20:10,608
And when I-- I bumped into him,

452
00:20:10,628 --> 00:20:13,641
I immediately whipped around
to apologize.

453
00:20:13,661 --> 00:20:16,968
But when I turned around,
he was standing there,

454
00:20:16,988 --> 00:20:19,981
and a...

455
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:24,496
a gun had fallen out
of his waistband.

456
00:20:26,364 --> 00:20:29,902
And so I-- I looked at the gun,

457
00:20:29,922 --> 00:20:32,476
and I looked at him.

458
00:20:32,496 --> 00:20:34,364
And he looked at the gun,

459
00:20:34,384 --> 00:20:35,633
and he looked at me.

460
00:20:35,653 --> 00:20:36,882
And here's the thing.

461
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,364
I was raised in the South,
right?

462
00:20:39,384 --> 00:20:40,311
So I was raised to be polite.

463
00:20:40,331 --> 00:20:43,661
I was raised to, you know,
make people feel comfortable,

464
00:20:43,681 --> 00:20:45,194
be affable and everything.

465
00:20:45,214 --> 00:20:47,031
So out of pure instinct,

466
00:20:47,051 --> 00:20:49,362
I-- I almost-- I knelt down

467
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:51,694
to pick up this man's gun.

468
00:20:54,968 --> 00:20:56,740
And about halfway down,
I was like,

469
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,628
"Let me not put my fingerprints
on this loose gun."

470
00:21:01,836 --> 00:21:02,981
He doesn't even have a holster.

471
00:21:03,001 --> 00:21:05,430
I am sure he is gonna do
something illegal

472
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:06,849
with this gun.

473
00:21:06,869 --> 00:21:10,694
And so I just stood back up,
and then he knelt down,

474
00:21:10,714 --> 00:21:11,948
and he picked it up.

475
00:21:11,968 --> 00:21:15,441
And he put it back
in his waistband,

476
00:21:15,461 --> 00:21:18,935
and we just stared
at each other.

477
00:21:18,955 --> 00:21:21,001
And then I went--

478
00:21:21,021 --> 00:21:23,661
[stutters]

479
00:21:24,968 --> 00:21:27,562
"Evening."

480
00:21:32,001 --> 00:21:34,529
I've never in my life.

481
00:21:34,549 --> 00:21:37,133
"Evening, sir."

482
00:21:40,628 --> 00:21:42,870
I don't know why,
but I felt like if I skipped,

483
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:45,133
he wouldn't shoot me,
you know what I mean?

484
00:21:45,153 --> 00:21:47,803
I'm a moving target.

485
00:21:50,968 --> 00:21:53,491
So as I was on a walk--

486
00:21:53,511 --> 00:21:56,014
'cause that's all I do now.

487
00:21:56,034 --> 00:21:58,925
Just leave the house
and walk till I get tired

488
00:21:58,945 --> 00:22:01,836
and then come home
and fall asleep and walk again.

489
00:22:01,856 --> 00:22:05,727
I'm basically my own dog.

490
00:22:09,067 --> 00:22:11,133
'Cause during lockdown,
what else could you do?

491
00:22:11,153 --> 00:22:14,100
That was all you could
only go for.

492
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,067
Everything was closed, you know?

493
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:19,816
And so I was on this walk,

494
00:22:19,836 --> 00:22:24,232
and I actually got to see
a public proposal.

495
00:22:24,869 --> 00:22:27,935
And I saw this guy stand
in front of this woman,

496
00:22:27,955 --> 00:22:30,661
and he took a step back,
and he knelt.

497
00:22:30,681 --> 00:22:32,314
He whipped a ring out.

498
00:22:32,334 --> 00:22:33,948
He popped it open.

499
00:22:33,968 --> 00:22:35,727
Asked her to marry him.

500
00:22:35,747 --> 00:22:37,080
And then she

501
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,694
hit him in the head with a rock.

502
00:22:39,714 --> 00:22:41,608
And...

503
00:22:41,628 --> 00:22:43,238
I am not a relationship expert,

504
00:22:43,258 --> 00:22:44,849
but that seems like a hard no.

505
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:48,298
That's a fast pass
right there, you know?

506
00:22:48,318 --> 00:22:49,113
And I don't know them.

507
00:22:49,133 --> 00:22:50,694
I don't know what's going on
with them or anything,

508
00:22:50,714 --> 00:22:53,232
so I just had to insert
something for myself.

509
00:22:53,252 --> 00:22:54,014
And if I'm being honest,

510
00:22:54,034 --> 00:22:58,034
last year, a lot of people
moved in together real quick.

511
00:22:58,054 --> 00:22:59,803
They were like, "Listen,
it's the end of the world.

512
00:22:59,823 --> 00:23:02,661
"I'm not paying two rents,
all right?

513
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:03,849
"Let's just live together.

514
00:23:03,869 --> 00:23:07,562
I like you enough.
We'll survive."

515
00:23:07,582 --> 00:23:08,377
So people partnered up

516
00:23:08,397 --> 00:23:10,837
and maybe that's
what happened to them.

517
00:23:10,857 --> 00:23:13,298
They partnered up early
in the pandemic,

518
00:23:13,318 --> 00:23:14,179
and every day,

519
00:23:14,199 --> 00:23:18,199
he fell more and more
in love with her.

520
00:23:18,219 --> 00:23:20,034
And every day...

521
00:23:24,001 --> 00:23:27,803
She got sicker
and sicker of him,

522
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:28,344
you know?

523
00:23:28,364 --> 00:23:31,968
Month two: they're sitting
at the breakfast table

524
00:23:31,988 --> 00:23:33,133
and he's just looking at her.

525
00:23:33,153 --> 00:23:33,915
He's just thinking.

526
00:23:33,935 --> 00:23:35,298
He's not saying anything
that's out loud.

527
00:23:35,318 --> 00:23:37,166
He's just thinking.

528
00:23:37,186 --> 00:23:38,278
"Wow.

529
00:23:38,298 --> 00:23:40,014
"The world may never
be normal again.

530
00:23:40,034 --> 00:23:42,080
"The world may be changed
forever as we know it,

531
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:46,836
"and I get to be sitting across
from this beautiful woman.

532
00:23:46,856 --> 00:23:50,265
"This-- this amazing woman,

533
00:23:50,285 --> 00:23:53,694
"that she even eats cute.

534
00:23:54,067 --> 00:23:56,364
"Look at her eating her cereal.

535
00:23:56,384 --> 00:23:59,364
"Little-- little bites.

536
00:24:00,265 --> 00:24:02,707
She is-- she's just
too cute, you know?"

537
00:24:02,727 --> 00:24:06,232
And then she's sitting
across from him thinking,

538
00:24:06,252 --> 00:24:08,783
"Is this motherfucker
watching me chew?

539
00:24:08,803 --> 00:24:11,869
"I don't like him looking deep
in my mouth like that.

540
00:24:11,889 --> 00:24:13,707
"That is weird as hell.

541
00:24:13,727 --> 00:24:17,397
Make me not even want
my food anymore."

542
00:24:18,968 --> 00:24:21,344
Month four:

543
00:24:21,364 --> 00:24:24,902
they're laying down watching
a movie together.

544
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:29,298
He has both of her hands
in his hands.

545
00:24:29,318 --> 00:24:30,740
And he's just thinking, like,

546
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,760
"Look at these--
look at these little hands.

547
00:24:35,034 --> 00:24:38,507
"Look at these
dainty little hands.

548
00:24:38,527 --> 00:24:42,001
She has the cutest hands
in the world."

549
00:24:42,021 --> 00:24:43,166
And then she's thinking,

550
00:24:43,186 --> 00:24:46,232
"This clammy bitch.

551
00:24:47,199 --> 00:24:49,727
"How did he even
get his hands this wet?

552
00:24:49,747 --> 00:24:50,542
"Did he wash his hands

553
00:24:50,562 --> 00:24:52,298
"before he sat down
and watched the movie?

554
00:24:52,318 --> 00:24:54,430
"My hands are soaking wet
right now.

555
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:55,915
"I am sopping wet.

556
00:24:55,935 --> 00:24:58,331
"I got a cup of water
in my hand right now

557
00:24:58,351 --> 00:25:00,014
"from his weak fingers

558
00:25:00,034 --> 00:25:03,331
rubbing up against my hands."

559
00:25:05,133 --> 00:25:07,882
Month eight:

560
00:25:07,902 --> 00:25:09,836
maybe they-- maybe they're
on a walk or something.

561
00:25:09,856 --> 00:25:12,166
Maybe they're actually
able to go out

562
00:25:12,186 --> 00:25:13,146
and do a thing, you know?

563
00:25:13,166 --> 00:25:15,001
Not much is open,
but maybe they go to, like,

564
00:25:15,021 --> 00:25:16,740
a Froyo place or something.

565
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,331
They're eating it together,
and he's like--

566
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,410
[whimpering]

567
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:23,397
"Look at her eating
her little Froyo.

568
00:25:23,417 --> 00:25:24,849
"You know what?
I can't wait.

569
00:25:24,869 --> 00:25:27,113
Tomorrow, I'm gonna do it."
- Oh, no.

570
00:25:27,133 --> 00:25:30,034
"I'm going to ask this
beautiful woman to marry me.

571
00:25:30,054 --> 00:25:31,902
"I'm going to get down
on one knee

572
00:25:31,922 --> 00:25:34,331
"and ask this angel to make me

573
00:25:34,351 --> 00:25:36,740
the happiest man in the world."

574
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,486
And then she was
sitting there thinking,

575
00:25:39,506 --> 00:25:42,210
"If his head was just
a little lower,

576
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:44,915
"I bet I could knock it
clean off.

577
00:25:44,935 --> 00:25:48,133
"I bet I could crack
his damn cerebellum

578
00:25:48,153 --> 00:25:49,311
if he gave me the chance."

579
00:25:49,331 --> 00:25:52,067
Cause I should mention-- I don't
know if I mentioned it up top--

580
00:25:52,087 --> 00:25:54,496
but when she hit him
in the head with a rock,

581
00:25:54,516 --> 00:25:56,014
she didn't pick up the rock.

582
00:25:56,034 --> 00:25:59,430
She just had a rock on her,
okay?

583
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:00,783
She was just as ready

584
00:26:00,803 --> 00:26:02,331
to hit him in the head
with a rock

585
00:26:02,351 --> 00:26:04,331
as he was to propose.

586
00:26:04,351 --> 00:26:06,311
Both just walking all day

587
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:08,199
with a rock
in their back pocket,

588
00:26:08,219 --> 00:26:11,265
and hers was just bigger.

589
00:26:13,968 --> 00:26:14,849
'Cause I should point out

590
00:26:14,869 --> 00:26:17,981
I wasn't the only one
who saw this, you know?

591
00:26:18,001 --> 00:26:21,803
Like, with any public proposal,
a crowd gathered around.

592
00:26:21,823 --> 00:26:24,298
People were aww-ing.
People started to clap.

593
00:26:24,318 --> 00:26:26,265
This proposal got claps.

594
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:27,748
But it only got two claps

595
00:26:27,768 --> 00:26:29,212
'cause people saw him kneel.

596
00:26:29,232 --> 00:26:31,529
And they even started-- they're
like, "That is so beau--

597
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:35,133
We should mind our business.
Let's just go."

598
00:26:40,954 --> 00:26:41,855
When I was trying
to take a break from my phone,

599
00:26:41,922 --> 00:26:43,090
you know what I really missed?

600
00:26:43,156 --> 00:26:45,259
My phone.

601
00:26:45,325 --> 00:26:47,761
I did.
It was like-- it hurt.

602
00:26:47,828 --> 00:26:48,996
It-- it was weird.

603
00:26:49,062 --> 00:26:52,366
It's hard to even explain,
you know?

604
00:26:52,432 --> 00:26:56,169
And it's when--
it's when it occurred to me

605
00:26:56,236 --> 00:26:59,539
that no one
will ever love anyone

606
00:26:59,606 --> 00:27:02,175
as much as you love your phone.

607
00:27:02,242 --> 00:27:05,379
I know it sounds sad to say,
but it's true.

608
00:27:05,445 --> 00:27:07,414
It is.

609
00:27:07,481 --> 00:27:08,715
You know?

610
00:27:08,782 --> 00:27:10,317
I've had conversations
with people,

611
00:27:10,384 --> 00:27:13,120
deep, long conversations
where I was like,

612
00:27:13,186 --> 00:27:14,788
"Wow, right now in this moment,

613
00:27:14,855 --> 00:27:16,523
"I think I'm making
a friend for life.

614
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,925
"I've opened up to this person

615
00:27:17,991 --> 00:27:19,760
more than I've opened up
to anyone in years."

616
00:27:19,826 --> 00:27:22,429
And eventually, they do just
pull out their phone and start,

617
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,997
like, checking something.

618
00:27:24,064 --> 00:27:25,999
And that's supposed to be rude,
but it's not rude.

619
00:27:26,066 --> 00:27:29,369
The phone is better.

620
00:27:29,436 --> 00:27:30,671
It is.

621
00:27:30,737 --> 00:27:32,039
You can do anything
you want on the phone,

622
00:27:32,105 --> 00:27:34,841
and I'm just yapping
about my parents' divorce.

623
00:27:34,908 --> 00:27:36,443
They pull out the phone like,

624
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:38,679
"This is way better than what
was happening two seconds ago.

625
00:27:38,745 --> 00:27:40,113
"Oh, my God.

626
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,449
Oh, he's still going.
He is a mess."

627
00:27:45,752 --> 00:27:47,521
You know?

628
00:27:50,224 --> 00:27:52,893
I drop my phone sometimes.

629
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,329
I don't know
if anyone else here does.

630
00:27:55,462 --> 00:27:57,197
But think about
the noises you make

631
00:27:57,264 --> 00:27:59,466
when you almost drop your phone.

632
00:28:01,134 --> 00:28:03,670
The true heartbreaking noises
that you make.

633
00:28:03,737 --> 00:28:05,305
It hadn't even hit the ground
yet and you're like--

634
00:28:05,372 --> 00:28:08,275
[shrieking]

635
00:28:09,576 --> 00:28:11,511
That was just it slipping
through one finger.

636
00:28:11,578 --> 00:28:13,513
It's still-- it's still
in your hand, but you--

637
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:16,650
[shrieking]

638
00:28:16,717 --> 00:28:17,851
And you mean it.

639
00:28:17,918 --> 00:28:19,686
It's coming from deep in here.

640
00:28:19,753 --> 00:28:21,188
It's coming from the heart.

641
00:28:21,255 --> 00:28:22,890
You couldn't mean it more.

642
00:28:22,956 --> 00:28:26,760
It's biological in you
to make that noise

643
00:28:26,827 --> 00:28:29,229
when you're dropping your baby.

644
00:28:32,232 --> 00:28:34,835
Now think of the noises we make

645
00:28:34,902 --> 00:28:37,704
when we see actual
car accidents.

646
00:28:37,771 --> 00:28:40,574
"Ooh, that's messed up.
I hope everybody okay.

647
00:28:40,641 --> 00:28:41,875
That looks terrible."

648
00:28:41,942 --> 00:28:44,278
You see how those
should be reversed?

649
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:46,947
'Cause truly, I drop my phone,

650
00:28:47,014 --> 00:28:50,317
and I go through
all five stages of grief.

651
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:51,718
I really do.

652
00:28:51,785 --> 00:28:53,287
You know?

653
00:28:53,353 --> 00:28:54,454
I drop it.

654
00:28:54,488 --> 00:28:55,989
It hits the ground.

655
00:28:56,056 --> 00:28:57,991
Denial.
[scoffs]

656
00:28:58,058 --> 00:28:59,793
"That's-- that's-- that's--
that's not a crack.

657
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,128
"That's just a hair, all right?

658
00:29:01,194 --> 00:29:03,030
"That's just a hair,
and as soon as I wipe it,

659
00:29:03,096 --> 00:29:05,165
"I'm gonna be gucci, okay?
My phone is fine.

660
00:29:05,232 --> 00:29:07,234
"I did not just mess up
my phone just now.

661
00:29:07,301 --> 00:29:09,503
I'm good.
I'm good."

662
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:10,704
Anger.
"Fuck!

663
00:29:10,771 --> 00:29:13,240
"I can't believe

664
00:29:13,307 --> 00:29:15,709
"I just dropped this phone

665
00:29:15,776 --> 00:29:17,878
"right outside the Apple store.

666
00:29:17,945 --> 00:29:20,480
"I am standing--
I bought it six seconds ago.

667
00:29:20,547 --> 00:29:23,383
"Cashier is still looking
at me in the face.

668
00:29:23,483 --> 00:29:26,353
"He waving at me,
and I dropped this phone

669
00:29:26,486 --> 00:29:28,928
through these brittle fingers."

670
00:29:28,948 --> 00:29:31,391
Bargaining.
"That's just the case.

671
00:29:31,491 --> 00:29:33,260
"That's the ca--
that's the case whole job

672
00:29:33,327 --> 00:29:35,495
"is to be like
the Secret Service of the phone

673
00:29:35,515 --> 00:29:37,097
"and take the hits
for the phone.

674
00:29:37,164 --> 00:29:38,732
"So that's where it's just
like a little soldier.

675
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,167
"It took that hit.
It cracked.

676
00:29:40,234 --> 00:29:41,735
My phone is fine though."

677
00:29:41,802 --> 00:29:43,136
Depression.
"My ex was right.

678
00:29:43,203 --> 00:29:45,539
"I don't handle
responsibility well at all

679
00:29:45,606 --> 00:29:47,107
"and that's why she left.

680
00:29:47,174 --> 00:29:49,576
And honestly, I think
she made the right move."

681
00:29:51,445 --> 00:29:52,646
Acceptance.
"You know what?

682
00:29:52,713 --> 00:29:56,116
"I just don't deserve
nice things, okay?

683
00:29:56,183 --> 00:29:57,484
"I don't know where
I get off getting it.

684
00:29:57,551 --> 00:30:00,354
I should've got a Nokia
like I deserve."

685
00:30:02,256 --> 00:30:04,438
I've been visiting
more people now,

686
00:30:04,458 --> 00:30:06,226
now that things are
opening up and stuff.

687
00:30:06,293 --> 00:30:08,896
And I went to visit

688
00:30:08,962 --> 00:30:10,998
one of my friends
who I haven't seen

689
00:30:11,064 --> 00:30:14,368
since before any
of the pandemic, you know?

690
00:30:14,468 --> 00:30:16,036
I haven't seen him
in a whole year,

691
00:30:16,103 --> 00:30:18,105
and he lives with his mom,

692
00:30:18,171 --> 00:30:21,008
his dad, his grandma,

693
00:30:21,074 --> 00:30:22,509
and his cousin.

694
00:30:22,576 --> 00:30:24,011
And it was so good
to see all of them,

695
00:30:24,077 --> 00:30:25,459
hang out a little bit,

696
00:30:25,479 --> 00:30:28,615
catch up and stuff,
but while I was there...

697
00:30:30,617 --> 00:30:32,886
I--

698
00:30:32,953 --> 00:30:34,955
not sure how to--

699
00:30:35,022 --> 00:30:36,089
while I was-- basically,

700
00:30:36,156 --> 00:30:37,491
my boy's grandma
got a crush on me,

701
00:30:37,558 --> 00:30:40,294
and I don't know
what to do about it.

702
00:30:40,427 --> 00:30:41,662
And I heard a couple "awws."

703
00:30:41,728 --> 00:30:43,997
This is not a Hallmark crush,
all right?

704
00:30:44,064 --> 00:30:45,766
This woman has carnal intentions

705
00:30:45,832 --> 00:30:48,101
towards my body, okay?

706
00:30:48,168 --> 00:30:51,004
She's not messing around.

707
00:30:51,071 --> 00:30:52,573
Okay?

708
00:30:52,639 --> 00:30:55,208
I was-- I was-- I was hanging
out there, and first of all,

709
00:30:55,275 --> 00:30:57,344
she wait till everybody
leave the room to hit on me.

710
00:30:57,444 --> 00:30:59,646
That's how you know
she a predator, okay?

711
00:30:59,713 --> 00:31:01,982
She wait till she can make it
he said, she said, right?

712
00:31:02,049 --> 00:31:04,451
So then everybody left the room
for a different reason,

713
00:31:04,518 --> 00:31:07,588
and she got right up on me,
just in my face all over me.

714
00:31:07,654 --> 00:31:09,323
And I tried
to let her down easy.

715
00:31:09,456 --> 00:31:12,693
I try and make it scientific
about the pandemic, you know?

716
00:31:14,194 --> 00:31:16,196
I was like, "Ma'am, ma'am,

717
00:31:16,263 --> 00:31:19,132
"we should social distance...

718
00:31:21,468 --> 00:31:23,937
"because, you know,
right now, I'm not vaccinated.

719
00:31:24,004 --> 00:31:26,340
"You're not vaccinated, okay?

720
00:31:26,473 --> 00:31:28,008
"And you're
in a high-risk demographic.

721
00:31:28,075 --> 00:31:30,711
I would hate for something
to happen to you, all right?"

722
00:31:30,777 --> 00:31:32,212
That's what I said.

723
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:35,382
And then she went...

724
00:31:35,482 --> 00:31:36,984
[laughs]
"Oh, sweetie.

725
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:38,752
I'm high risk and high reward."

726
00:31:38,819 --> 00:31:40,821
I was like--

727
00:31:40,888 --> 00:31:43,790
[cheers and applause]

728
00:31:50,831 --> 00:31:53,133
So I just stuck
to my buddy like glue.

729
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,502
Anywhere he went
is where I went in the house.

730
00:31:55,569 --> 00:31:57,604
Just-- I was-- I was right
behind him everywhere he went.

731
00:31:57,671 --> 00:31:59,306
I just didn't want to be
left alone with her again

732
00:31:59,439 --> 00:32:03,343
'cause that mean
she's aggressive, okay?

733
00:32:03,443 --> 00:32:05,445
And I'm not gonna lie.

734
00:32:05,479 --> 00:32:08,048
She old,
but I think she faking it

735
00:32:08,115 --> 00:32:09,516
'cause she's old,
but she's fast.

736
00:32:09,583 --> 00:32:11,218
'Cause if we would
leave the room,

737
00:32:11,285 --> 00:32:12,753
and she wouldn't be in the room
with us at all,

738
00:32:12,819 --> 00:32:15,489
and I would turn around,
she'd just be right behind me.

739
00:32:15,556 --> 00:32:18,725
Like, are you running?
How are you doing this?

740
00:32:18,792 --> 00:32:22,329
But she was behind me,
and she pinched my butt.

741
00:32:22,462 --> 00:32:25,098
And pitching butts is
that old lady sexual harassment

742
00:32:25,165 --> 00:32:27,301
that nobody cares about,
you know?

743
00:32:27,367 --> 00:32:31,171
Even if I tell people like,
"She got me, all right?"

744
00:32:31,238 --> 00:32:33,840
They're like, "Well...
[scoffs]

745
00:32:33,907 --> 00:32:35,108
"She's 85.

746
00:32:35,175 --> 00:32:37,477
"You should've been faster,
okay?

747
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,580
Honestly, just move."

748
00:32:40,847 --> 00:32:42,249
But she did.

749
00:32:42,316 --> 00:32:44,151
She pinched my butt
and then whispered in my ear,

750
00:32:44,217 --> 00:32:46,186
"You firm like my mattress."

751
00:32:46,253 --> 00:32:50,023
It's like, "Oh, my God.

752
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:53,760
"Oh, my God.

753
00:32:53,827 --> 00:32:56,630
I am going to leave."

754
00:32:56,697 --> 00:33:00,234
And so I left, and I don't know
how, but she got my number.

755
00:33:02,202 --> 00:33:03,503
I think she got it
out of my buddy's phone

756
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:05,205
when he wasn't paying attention.

757
00:33:05,272 --> 00:33:06,840
And she has been sending me

758
00:33:06,907 --> 00:33:10,444
nonstop thirst traps, okay?

759
00:33:10,477 --> 00:33:11,812
But they're granny thirst traps

760
00:33:11,878 --> 00:33:13,880
so it's just pictures
of food that she cook.

761
00:33:13,947 --> 00:33:16,617
But still-- still,

762
00:33:16,683 --> 00:33:19,319
there is innuendo involved,
you know?

763
00:33:19,453 --> 00:33:22,222
She sent me a picture
of a cobbler

764
00:33:22,289 --> 00:33:23,991
and then text me under it,

765
00:33:24,057 --> 00:33:27,227
"I could break you off some if
you want to come on through."

766
00:33:27,294 --> 00:33:29,296
I was like,

767
00:33:29,363 --> 00:33:32,799
"I am going to throw my phone
in the river.

768
00:33:32,866 --> 00:33:36,670
I hate this way more
than I love my phone."

769
00:33:40,386 --> 00:33:42,201
I just want people
to be happy.

770
00:33:42,221 --> 00:33:46,485
I feel like we can be happy
if we get out of our own way.

771
00:33:46,505 --> 00:33:49,122
Like I-- I-- I have friends

772
00:33:49,142 --> 00:33:50,993
who are dating,

773
00:33:51,013 --> 00:33:54,353
trying to date
in New York and stuff.

774
00:33:54,373 --> 00:33:55,465
And especially my female friends

775
00:33:55,485 --> 00:33:58,300
will talk to me
about their troubles

776
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,564
trying to date in, like,
a metropolitan city--

777
00:34:00,584 --> 00:34:04,310
trying to date in the age
of the apps and everything.

778
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:08,056
And I even had one friend,
she came to me with this list.

779
00:34:08,076 --> 00:34:10,402
And it was the list
of everything

780
00:34:10,422 --> 00:34:12,729
that she wanted
in a guy, you know?

781
00:34:12,749 --> 00:34:17,056
And I told her honestly
'cause I care about her,

782
00:34:17,076 --> 00:34:18,729
"I need you to take that list

783
00:34:18,749 --> 00:34:21,630
"and throw it in the trash,
all right?

784
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:24,221
"Burn it if you have to
if that will help you

785
00:34:24,241 --> 00:34:26,617
forget the memory."

786
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:30,107
I'll tell you right now,
there's only three things.

787
00:34:30,127 --> 00:34:33,419
There's only three attributes
that you could hope for

788
00:34:33,439 --> 00:34:36,716
in a guy that
you're gonna make a partner.

789
00:34:36,736 --> 00:34:39,663
There's only three.

790
00:34:39,683 --> 00:34:43,848
You need to pick two, okay?

791
00:34:44,551 --> 00:34:48,254
You need to pick two
of those three,

792
00:34:48,274 --> 00:34:51,432
whichever two you can live with

793
00:34:51,452 --> 00:34:54,122
and move on 'cause you're
not gonna get all three.

794
00:34:54,142 --> 00:34:58,221
I hate it for you,
but it's not gonna happen.

795
00:34:59,419 --> 00:35:02,551
I'll go over 'em right now.

796
00:35:02,571 --> 00:35:05,551
There's good dick,

797
00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:07,762
good person,

798
00:35:07,782 --> 00:35:09,168
got his shit together.

799
00:35:09,188 --> 00:35:13,089
You need to pick
two of those three.

800
00:35:18,518 --> 00:35:21,650
Whichever two work for you

801
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:24,366
and move on.

802
00:35:24,386 --> 00:35:27,366
And if he has one, leave.

803
00:35:27,386 --> 00:35:30,650
Don't let a one ruin your life.

804
00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:34,815
Just one!
Mm.

805
00:35:35,518 --> 00:35:36,663
I honestly-- I have friends

806
00:35:36,683 --> 00:35:37,729
complain to me about their ones,

807
00:35:37,749 --> 00:35:40,287
and I'm falling asleep
listening to the story

808
00:35:40,307 --> 00:35:41,069
'cause it's just boring.

809
00:35:41,089 --> 00:35:43,221
It's like, "Well, you told me
you had one to begin with,

810
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:47,353
so what are we really
talking about?"

811
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:50,508
If he's just a good person,

812
00:35:50,528 --> 00:35:53,432
doesn't have good dick,

813
00:35:53,452 --> 00:35:55,716
doesn't have his shit together,

814
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:58,650
just a good person?

815
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:06,925
That's a friend.

816
00:36:06,945 --> 00:36:09,221
Like, that's...

817
00:36:15,419 --> 00:36:18,409
Y'all can hang out
on the weekends, go to museums.

818
00:36:18,429 --> 00:36:21,419
I don't know why you trying
to force more, you know?

819
00:36:21,439 --> 00:36:24,353
If he's just good dick,

820
00:36:24,373 --> 00:36:26,133
just good dick,

821
00:36:26,153 --> 00:36:27,894
not a good person,

822
00:36:27,914 --> 00:36:30,617
doesn't have his shit together,

823
00:36:30,637 --> 00:36:32,465
just good dick?

824
00:36:32,485 --> 00:36:35,442
That's literally a dildo.

825
00:36:35,462 --> 00:36:38,419
That's what a dildo is for.

826
00:36:38,914 --> 00:36:39,861
Why are you stressed over him?

827
00:36:39,881 --> 00:36:44,353
Make a mold of his dick
in his sleep and leave!

828
00:36:45,683 --> 00:36:48,320
Nobody puts their vibrator
back in the drawer, like,

829
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,584
"He forgot my birthday."

830
00:36:49,604 --> 00:36:51,914
Like, that's...

831
00:36:52,518 --> 00:36:54,617
It's not gonna happen
if you treat it

832
00:36:54,637 --> 00:36:57,617
like what it's for.

833
00:36:58,419 --> 00:37:01,353
'Cause you're not
gonna get all three.

834
00:37:01,373 --> 00:37:03,803
And I hate it for you.

835
00:37:03,823 --> 00:37:06,254
I really do.
Sincerely.

836
00:37:06,584 --> 00:37:09,353
And every time
I have this conversation

837
00:37:09,373 --> 00:37:11,234
with-- with my friends,

838
00:37:11,254 --> 00:37:12,729
sometimes they-- they get upset.

839
00:37:12,749 --> 00:37:15,287
Not every time.
Sometimes they do get upset

840
00:37:15,307 --> 00:37:18,716
and they're like, "No.

841
00:37:21,947 --> 00:37:23,848
"No, he has all three.

842
00:37:23,868 --> 00:37:25,630
"No.

843
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:26,947
"No, he has all three.

844
00:37:26,967 --> 00:37:28,430
"I know it.

845
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:29,894
"I feel it.

846
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,419
"I feel it here
and here and here.

847
00:37:32,439 --> 00:37:34,366
"No.

848
00:37:34,386 --> 00:37:36,630
He has all three."

849
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:38,475
If you really think
he has all three,

850
00:37:38,495 --> 00:37:40,300
he's going to kill you,
all right?

851
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,716
That is a murderer
putting on a facade, okay?

852
00:37:45,419 --> 00:37:47,749
I'm sure all 33 women
thought Ted Bundy

853
00:37:47,769 --> 00:37:50,051
had all three, you know?

854
00:37:50,071 --> 00:37:52,333
Like, "No, Ted is just nice.

855
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,607
"You know, it's just nice
to meet a guy that, like,

856
00:37:54,627 --> 00:37:56,881
"has his shit together,
is a lawyer and everything,

857
00:37:56,901 --> 00:37:58,397
"and, like, knows how to--
knows his way

858
00:37:58,417 --> 00:38:00,106
"around the bedroom,
knows how to listen.

859
00:38:00,126 --> 00:38:01,815
"Why are you looking at me
like that?

860
00:38:01,835 --> 00:38:02,399
[yelps]"

861
00:38:02,419 --> 00:38:06,056
Like, that's how
it went every time.

862
00:38:08,353 --> 00:38:11,452
You know what-- you wanna
know what bothers me?

863
00:38:11,472 --> 00:38:13,531
What really upsets me?

864
00:38:13,551 --> 00:38:16,881
What even scares me
a little bit?

865
00:38:16,901 --> 00:38:20,584
I don't know which two I am.

866
00:38:25,749 --> 00:38:28,123
'Cause I don't get
to decide, you know?

867
00:38:28,143 --> 00:38:30,254
That's another person's
decision about me.

868
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:32,133
I'm scared I'm going
to be laying back

869
00:38:32,153 --> 00:38:33,611
with my girl
years from now, right?

870
00:38:33,631 --> 00:38:35,069
Years from now just laying back.

871
00:38:35,089 --> 00:38:38,551
We're talking about this, and I
lean over to her, and I'm like,

872
00:38:38,571 --> 00:38:42,914
"I'm-- I'm good dick
and a good person, right?"

873
00:38:48,584 --> 00:38:53,056
And she's like, "You have
a great job, all right?"

874
00:38:54,386 --> 00:38:57,914
[cheers and applause]

875
00:39:03,844 --> 00:39:05,446
Last year was tough because

876
00:39:05,513 --> 00:39:08,616
I also lost people, you know?

877
00:39:08,683 --> 00:39:11,552
We all did to a certain degree.

878
00:39:11,619 --> 00:39:14,689
We lost people, and some
of the people that I've lost,

879
00:39:14,755 --> 00:39:16,824
like, I-- I had a friend
who passed away.

880
00:39:16,891 --> 00:39:19,660
And he passed away

881
00:39:19,727 --> 00:39:22,363
during the height of infection,
so we couldn't gather,

882
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:24,966
we couldn't go all be together

883
00:39:25,032 --> 00:39:28,069
and mourn him properly.

884
00:39:28,135 --> 00:39:32,306
And so we, uh...

885
00:39:32,373 --> 00:39:35,343
we had to have a Zoom funeral.

886
00:39:38,045 --> 00:39:41,782
I don't know if you've been
to a Zoom meeting,

887
00:39:41,849 --> 00:39:44,252
but this had all the awkwardness

888
00:39:44,318 --> 00:39:45,486
of a Zoom meeting

889
00:39:45,553 --> 00:39:47,188
but added as a funeral.

890
00:39:47,255 --> 00:39:49,090
It was terrible.

891
00:39:49,156 --> 00:39:52,994
'Cause at least at a funeral,
at a real funeral, right?

892
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,762
We're all facing the body.

893
00:39:54,829 --> 00:39:57,465
We're all collectively
facing the same direction,

894
00:39:57,531 --> 00:39:58,933
looking at the body.

895
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,870
And on Zoom,
we are all facing each other.

896
00:40:05,172 --> 00:40:06,474
And I'm not going to lie.

897
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:09,076
Not everybody looks
upset enough for me, okay?

898
00:40:09,143 --> 00:40:10,578
There's some people
whose screens are blue.

899
00:40:10,645 --> 00:40:12,079
I'm like,
"You playing 'Cyberpunk.'

900
00:40:12,146 --> 00:40:13,347
"I could already tell.

901
00:40:13,414 --> 00:40:15,005
Why are you blue,
and nobody else is blue?"

902
00:40:15,025 --> 00:40:16,617
There was one dude
that was just eating chips,

903
00:40:16,684 --> 00:40:19,353
like, how are you gonna
let him eat the chips?

904
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,888
He just eating chips
and they'd take it off

905
00:40:20,955 --> 00:40:22,890
'cause he's making noise
eating the chips

906
00:40:22,957 --> 00:40:24,258
completely unmuted.

907
00:40:24,325 --> 00:40:25,526
It's just preacher, Pringles,

908
00:40:25,593 --> 00:40:27,828
preacher, Pringles,
preacher, Pringles.

909
00:40:29,497 --> 00:40:32,466
I know you at your house,
but this is a funeral.

910
00:40:33,668 --> 00:40:35,469
No, it was horrible.

911
00:40:35,536 --> 00:40:38,839
People didn't know
they weren't muted.

912
00:40:38,906 --> 00:40:40,041
There was one dude
that was like,

913
00:40:40,107 --> 00:40:41,609
"It's a funeral.

914
00:40:41,676 --> 00:40:44,178
"No, it's a funeral.

915
00:40:44,245 --> 00:40:46,147
"Willy died.

916
00:40:46,214 --> 00:40:47,481
"I told you Willy died.

917
00:40:47,548 --> 00:40:48,816
"Look, he on the screen
right here.

918
00:40:48,836 --> 00:40:50,918
"Come look.
Come look.

919
00:40:50,985 --> 00:40:52,253
"They got him
all messed up though.

920
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,654
"They messed up
that last haircut.

921
00:40:53,721 --> 00:40:55,122
"I wouldn't let 'em
bury me like that.

922
00:40:55,189 --> 00:40:56,224
"That's terrible.
Oh, my God.

923
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:57,825
I'm not muted.
I'm not muted!"

924
00:41:00,394 --> 00:41:02,129
Preacher got on there.

925
00:41:02,196 --> 00:41:05,132
And here's the thing; there was
at least one family member

926
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:07,668
that was allowed to be at the
funeral home with the preacher

927
00:41:07,768 --> 00:41:09,393
with the body and everything,

928
00:41:09,413 --> 00:41:11,038
and they said that he preached

929
00:41:11,105 --> 00:41:13,841
a-- a really uplifting sermon,
you know?

930
00:41:13,908 --> 00:41:15,910
Especially if you, you know,
grew up Christian or something.

931
00:41:15,977 --> 00:41:17,245
He used all the--

932
00:41:17,311 --> 00:41:18,946
all the things we've all heard
before, you know?

933
00:41:19,013 --> 00:41:22,583
Got up there, acted like
it was a full church house,

934
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:25,286
even though it was just
a webcam and one person.

935
00:41:25,353 --> 00:41:26,821
And he was like,

936
00:41:26,888 --> 00:41:29,630
"See, see, see, see,
see, Willy, Willy,

937
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:32,393
"Willy may be dead.
We already know that.

938
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,629
"We know Willy dead, okay?

939
00:41:34,695 --> 00:41:36,197
"But his body is dead.

940
00:41:36,264 --> 00:41:39,700
"His soul!
His soul!

941
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,603
"His soul is up there
with the Redeemer, all right?

942
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:45,806
"His soul is with the one
that ascended, all right?

943
00:41:45,873 --> 00:41:48,576
"It's with the one
that ascended!

944
00:41:48,643 --> 00:41:51,012
"Willy out there doing--
doing moonwalking with Jesus

945
00:41:51,078 --> 00:41:52,446
"right now.

946
00:41:52,513 --> 00:41:54,115
"Don't mourn for Willy,
all right?

947
00:41:54,181 --> 00:41:56,918
"Willy having a good time
up in the clouds.

948
00:41:57,919 --> 00:42:00,388
"No pain, no suffering, okay?

949
00:42:00,454 --> 00:42:01,856
"Willy in a better place now.

950
00:42:01,923 --> 00:42:04,191
"Willy may be dead, all right?

951
00:42:04,258 --> 00:42:07,161
But he is not gone, all right?"

952
00:42:08,162 --> 00:42:10,064
Sure.

953
00:42:11,532 --> 00:42:12,833
[sighs]

954
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,937
But his connection had a lag.

955
00:42:19,407 --> 00:42:24,478
So all we heard on our end was,

956
00:42:24,545 --> 00:42:26,480
"Willy.

957
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:30,952
"Ass.

958
00:42:34,422 --> 00:42:36,657
"Dead.

959
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,629
Gone."

960
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:46,534
I'm like,
"That-- that about sums it up,

961
00:42:46,601 --> 00:42:49,036
but that's pretty rude."

962
00:42:53,808 --> 00:42:55,576
It's really good.

963
00:42:55,643 --> 00:42:57,678
It's for the best

964
00:42:57,812 --> 00:42:59,347
that I'm gonna die.

965
00:42:59,413 --> 00:43:00,982
Not now.

966
00:43:01,048 --> 00:43:02,917
I wanna live a long life and
everything and all that stuff.

967
00:43:02,984 --> 00:43:06,053
But still, like,
eventually, mm--

968
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,155
we're done.

969
00:43:08,222 --> 00:43:09,991
And I say that
because here's the thing.

970
00:43:10,057 --> 00:43:12,660
I-- I feel-- I feel at least--
I don't know.

971
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,996
But I think that
I'm a good person,

972
00:43:15,062 --> 00:43:18,266
and I do the best to make
the world as good of a place

973
00:43:18,332 --> 00:43:20,801
as I can for the people
that I meet, you know?

974
00:43:20,868 --> 00:43:22,770
If I hurt someone,
I try to fix it.

975
00:43:22,837 --> 00:43:24,672
And if someone is hurt already,

976
00:43:24,772 --> 00:43:26,507
I try and make them
feel better, you know?

977
00:43:26,574 --> 00:43:28,142
I just want to help.

978
00:43:28,209 --> 00:43:31,779
And I think-- I think I'm as
progressive as you could get.

979
00:43:31,812 --> 00:43:34,415
I don't know, maybe.

980
00:43:34,482 --> 00:43:36,884
But give me 80 years.

981
00:43:36,951 --> 00:43:40,454
I'm sure
I'll hit a wall somewhere.

982
00:43:40,521 --> 00:43:42,557
It happens to everybody.

983
00:43:42,623 --> 00:43:43,791
Everybody hits a wall.

984
00:43:43,824 --> 00:43:45,493
They act like
there's this huge, like,

985
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,495
there-- there--
there's this huge battle

986
00:43:47,562 --> 00:43:50,531
between the generations,
and there's not.

987
00:43:50,598 --> 00:43:53,200
It's just medicine got too good.

988
00:43:54,635 --> 00:43:56,404
So people that were nice
and then should have died

989
00:43:56,470 --> 00:44:00,041
are still alive and very upset,
saying terrible things.

990
00:44:02,643 --> 00:44:03,978
And I'm not better than anybody.

991
00:44:04,045 --> 00:44:06,981
I could be one of them,
you know?

992
00:44:07,048 --> 00:44:08,382
I know people

993
00:44:08,449 --> 00:44:10,751
who marched in the Civil
Rights Movement, right?

994
00:44:10,818 --> 00:44:12,653
For equality.

995
00:44:12,753 --> 00:44:14,922
Just be able to have
what someone else has

996
00:44:14,989 --> 00:44:17,658
by virtue of being a person,
you know?

997
00:44:17,758 --> 00:44:20,027
And they got dogs sicced on 'em,

998
00:44:20,094 --> 00:44:22,897
and they got the shit
beat out of them, okay?

999
00:44:22,964 --> 00:44:24,765
And even with some of them--
just some--

1000
00:44:24,785 --> 00:44:26,747
but even with some of them,

1001
00:44:26,767 --> 00:44:28,169
if you bring up
marriage equality,

1002
00:44:28,236 --> 00:44:31,105
they're like,
"Let's not get crazy."

1003
00:44:31,172 --> 00:44:33,841
Let's not get crazy?

1004
00:44:33,908 --> 00:44:35,443
What were you-- what were you

1005
00:44:35,509 --> 00:44:38,613
doing it for then, you know?

1006
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:40,815
The '60s, you're over there
holding hands,

1007
00:44:40,882 --> 00:44:42,116
holding the lines,

1008
00:44:42,183 --> 00:44:44,051
sitting in, singing,
"We Shall Overcome."

1009
00:44:44,118 --> 00:44:45,920
Who would have thought
your grandson

1010
00:44:45,987 --> 00:44:49,257
would have to overcome you,
you know?

1011
00:44:49,323 --> 00:44:51,392
What?

1012
00:44:51,459 --> 00:44:54,228
Tell me I'm wrong.

1013
00:44:54,295 --> 00:44:55,563
It's true.

1014
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:57,665
And I want to find out
what my line is.

1015
00:44:57,798 --> 00:45:00,501
I'd like to just be that dude
that was nice to everybody,

1016
00:45:00,568 --> 00:45:02,837
and then he died.

1017
00:45:02,904 --> 00:45:05,039
Sounds like a pretty good life.

1018
00:45:05,106 --> 00:45:06,807
'Cause I'm a super
progressive guy now,

1019
00:45:06,874 --> 00:45:08,843
but give me 80 years.

1020
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:10,545
I'll-- I'll find a thing.

1021
00:45:10,611 --> 00:45:11,812
I won't even do it on purpose.

1022
00:45:11,879 --> 00:45:13,748
I just won't get it, you know?

1023
00:45:13,768 --> 00:45:15,349
I won't be a bad person.

1024
00:45:15,416 --> 00:45:18,152
I just won't understand.

1025
00:45:18,219 --> 00:45:21,088
I don't know what it is now,
but it's coming.

1026
00:45:22,623 --> 00:45:24,425
In fact, I bet I can-- I can
take a guess at what it is.

1027
00:45:24,492 --> 00:45:26,894
It's going to be robots.

1028
00:45:26,961 --> 00:45:29,130
It will.
AI is getting too good.

1029
00:45:29,196 --> 00:45:31,632
It's not too long before they
put it in a body, all right?

1030
00:45:31,766 --> 00:45:32,600
And then they're just
walking around

1031
00:45:32,667 --> 00:45:34,201
amongst us and everything.

1032
00:45:34,268 --> 00:45:35,603
And then, years later,

1033
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:38,606
my granddaughter brings home
a robot to Thanksgiving,

1034
00:45:38,673 --> 00:45:40,808
and I don't like it.

1035
00:45:43,978 --> 00:45:46,147
I don't like it at all.

1036
00:45:46,214 --> 00:45:49,550
And now I'm that old racist
at the table, you know?

1037
00:45:49,617 --> 00:45:51,118
Nice young man.

1038
00:45:51,185 --> 00:45:52,820
Couldn't be more respectful
in my house, right?

1039
00:45:52,887 --> 00:45:55,356
But I'm sitting there saying
all the racist stuff,

1040
00:45:55,423 --> 00:45:57,892
leaning over my granddaughter
like...

1041
00:46:00,194 --> 00:46:02,830
[scoffs]

1042
00:46:02,897 --> 00:46:06,167
"You can fuck him, but don't
marry him, all right?"

1043
00:46:08,102 --> 00:46:10,338
"Grandpa."
"What?"

1044
00:46:13,007 --> 00:46:14,475
20 minutes into dinner,
I'm like,

1045
00:46:14,542 --> 00:46:15,743
"Hey, Siri, pass the salt.

1046
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:17,912
[laughs]"

1047
00:46:23,084 --> 00:46:25,353
"Grandpa."
"What?"

1048
00:46:25,419 --> 00:46:29,257
"You can't say that.
That's their word, okay?"

1049
00:46:32,593 --> 00:46:35,796
"I invented the word.
I think I get to say it."

1050
00:46:37,531 --> 00:46:39,747
You know?

1051
00:46:39,767 --> 00:46:42,603
Hour into dinner, "What, is--

1052
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:44,405
"so what, your--

1053
00:46:44,472 --> 00:46:46,340
"your grandpa like a blender,
or something?

1054
00:46:46,407 --> 00:46:48,676
[laughs]"

1055
00:46:48,776 --> 00:46:51,379
"Grandpa."
"What?"

1056
00:46:51,445 --> 00:46:54,615
"His grandfather
<i>was</i> a blender, okay?

1057
00:46:54,682 --> 00:46:55,783
"And they kept him in the house,

1058
00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:57,084
"and they worked him to death,

1059
00:46:57,151 --> 00:47:00,121
and then they threw him out
when he got old."

1060
00:47:02,623 --> 00:47:05,726
"Nah, at least he was
in the house, you know?

1061
00:47:08,229 --> 00:47:09,730
"Wasn't one of these
outside robots.

1062
00:47:09,797 --> 00:47:10,898
"He wasn't like-- it wasn't like

1063
00:47:10,965 --> 00:47:11,899
"he was a lawnmower
or something.

1064
00:47:11,966 --> 00:47:15,102
He didn't have it that hard."

1065
00:47:15,169 --> 00:47:16,404
You know?

1066
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:19,607
"Haven't we'd done enough
for you people?

1067
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:21,609
"Gotta watch you every day.
We didn't do anything.

1068
00:47:21,742 --> 00:47:23,878
"I didn't do anything to you.
They-- they liked the work.

1069
00:47:23,945 --> 00:47:26,814
"They didn't complain, you know?

1070
00:47:26,881 --> 00:47:28,816
"Now, every-- every weekend,
can't go anywhere

1071
00:47:28,883 --> 00:47:31,185
"without you guys marching,

1072
00:47:31,252 --> 00:47:34,155
talking about how
'bot lives matter, ' whatever."

1073
00:47:37,225 --> 00:47:40,228
And then I die,
and nobody's sad.

1074
00:47:42,997 --> 00:47:44,966
The thing that I love
about telling that joke

1075
00:47:45,032 --> 00:47:46,747
is that in it,

1076
00:47:46,767 --> 00:47:49,070
I actually make up
a form of bigotry,

1077
00:47:49,136 --> 00:47:51,205
but this is so Brooklyn,
some of you were like,

1078
00:47:51,272 --> 00:47:54,542
"You need to check your
organic privilege, all right?

1079
00:47:56,577 --> 00:47:58,880
"Just because he's made
of nuts and bolts

1080
00:47:58,946 --> 00:48:02,083
does not diminish
his personhood, all right?"

1081
00:48:02,149 --> 00:48:03,584
I made it up.
It's not going to happen.

1082
00:48:03,718 --> 00:48:05,486
I promise you.

1083
00:48:08,355 --> 00:48:10,959
Here's the thing.

1084
00:48:13,421 --> 00:48:15,388
We're in a time--

1085
00:48:15,408 --> 00:48:16,675
[sighs]

1086
00:48:16,695 --> 00:48:17,906
Where as a-- a comic,

1087
00:48:17,926 --> 00:48:19,833
it feels like
there's another level.

1088
00:48:19,853 --> 00:48:21,761
It feels like you have
to do two things.

1089
00:48:21,781 --> 00:48:23,269
You have to both

1090
00:48:23,289 --> 00:48:26,025
give people permission to laugh

1091
00:48:26,045 --> 00:48:27,401
and make them laugh

1092
00:48:27,421 --> 00:48:28,741
'cause we're in
a very tense time

1093
00:48:28,761 --> 00:48:30,368
where a lot of terrible things
are being said,

1094
00:48:30,388 --> 00:48:32,741
but a lot of people don't mean
to say terrible things.

1095
00:48:32,761 --> 00:48:34,992
And a lot of people are worried
about what people will think

1096
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:38,860
if they say something
and it's-- it's tense.

1097
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,873
And so you have to both--

1098
00:48:41,893 --> 00:48:43,104
you have to give
people permission, like,

1099
00:48:43,124 --> 00:48:46,860
hey, here, right now,
we might as well be family.

1100
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:47,774
We're having a good time,

1101
00:48:47,794 --> 00:48:49,421
and I'm sharing
my thoughts with you,

1102
00:48:49,441 --> 00:48:50,401
and I hope you enjoy them.

1103
00:48:50,421 --> 00:48:52,246
And if you don't, I understand.

1104
00:48:52,266 --> 00:48:54,071
But I want to open up the floor

1105
00:48:54,091 --> 00:48:57,124
and give you permission
to have the best time possible

1106
00:48:57,144 --> 00:48:59,137
with the things that I'm saying.

1107
00:48:59,157 --> 00:49:02,322
And then you have to give
people something good enough

1108
00:49:02,342 --> 00:49:04,157
to laugh at.

1109
00:49:04,177 --> 00:49:05,972
I say that

1110
00:49:05,992 --> 00:49:09,124
because this next thing...

1111
00:49:10,794 --> 00:49:12,005
I'm telling you I want you

1112
00:49:12,025 --> 00:49:15,487
to have a good time with it,
'cause I did.

1113
00:49:15,926 --> 00:49:17,959
I was visiting
one of my friends.

1114
00:49:17,979 --> 00:49:22,421
And over the pandemic, he--

1115
00:49:23,355 --> 00:49:25,196
he got a bird,

1116
00:49:25,216 --> 00:49:27,038
which is weird.

1117
00:49:27,058 --> 00:49:29,302
I don't know.
It is.

1118
00:49:29,322 --> 00:49:31,236
Like, he-- he lives in a studio.

1119
00:49:31,256 --> 00:49:33,630
It's the biggest bird
I've ever seen,

1120
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:36,025
and now his apartment
is a quarter bird.

1121
00:49:36,045 --> 00:49:38,170
It's just-- it is cumbersome.

1122
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:42,124
It is a reverse Maya Angelou
in there.

1123
00:49:43,926 --> 00:49:45,807
Just bird upset.

1124
00:49:45,827 --> 00:49:47,170
Nobody's having a good time.

1125
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:50,048
It's weird
because it was odd of him

1126
00:49:50,068 --> 00:49:52,906
to see a majestic creature
and be like,

1127
00:49:52,926 --> 00:49:57,421
"Well, if I can't be outside,
neither can you," you know?

1128
00:49:57,629 --> 00:49:59,421
But he did.
He got his-- this bird.

1129
00:49:59,441 --> 00:50:00,170
And it's a parrot.

1130
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:03,124
I know it's a parrot,
but it's the biggest parrot

1131
00:50:03,144 --> 00:50:06,104
I've ever seen
in my entire life.

1132
00:50:06,124 --> 00:50:08,147
And while I was hanging out
at his place,

1133
00:50:08,167 --> 00:50:10,170
at one point,
he went to the bathroom.

1134
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:13,157
And when he went
to the bathroom, I think--

1135
00:50:13,177 --> 00:50:13,873
I don't know,

1136
00:50:13,893 --> 00:50:17,071
I can't be certain,
but I'm almost sure

1137
00:50:17,091 --> 00:50:20,959
that while he was
in the bathroom, the parrot...

1138
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:24,553
Said the n-word.

1139
00:50:27,586 --> 00:50:28,566
And I don't know.
I did--

1140
00:50:28,586 --> 00:50:30,926
I wasn't sure if I had
picked up on it at first

1141
00:50:30,946 --> 00:50:32,355
because it didn't say it
like a dude.

1142
00:50:32,375 --> 00:50:34,807
It said it like a bird.

1143
00:50:34,827 --> 00:50:37,893
You know I'm just sitting there
on my phone, and I hear,

1144
00:50:37,913 --> 00:50:39,289
"[high-pitched]
Nigga."

1145
00:50:39,309 --> 00:50:41,926
And I'm like...

1146
00:50:43,223 --> 00:50:45,860
That-- that wasn't it,
but it was clear.

1147
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,500
It had all the notes.

1148
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:50,180
That might've been it, you know?

1149
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,860
But I was like,
"No, I'm tripping."

1150
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,223
I just went back to my phone,

1151
00:50:53,243 --> 00:50:54,566
and then I heard, "Nigga."

1152
00:50:54,586 --> 00:50:56,696
And I'm like, "That was slower.

1153
00:50:56,716 --> 00:50:58,807
"That one might've been spot-on.

1154
00:50:58,827 --> 00:51:01,482
I think he trying
to tell me something."

1155
00:51:01,502 --> 00:51:04,157
But even if he is,
what am I going to do?

1156
00:51:04,177 --> 00:51:06,434
I'm gonna fight a bird?

1157
00:51:06,454 --> 00:51:08,662
I went back to my phone,
shook it off,

1158
00:51:08,682 --> 00:51:10,137
and then the third one--

1159
00:51:10,157 --> 00:51:12,114
third one had some stank on it.

1160
00:51:12,134 --> 00:51:14,091
The third one was like,
"Nigga."

1161
00:51:14,111 --> 00:51:16,926
And I'm like, "That's..."

1162
00:51:17,586 --> 00:51:19,992
And when I turned around,
he was looking at me.

1163
00:51:20,012 --> 00:51:24,190
I'm like,
"He is clearly doing this."

1164
00:51:24,388 --> 00:51:26,629
But it was weird.
I didn't know what to do.

1165
00:51:26,649 --> 00:51:28,642
I was frozen because

1166
00:51:28,662 --> 00:51:31,256
saying "cracker"
is their whole thing,

1167
00:51:31,276 --> 00:51:34,388
and he went fully left.

1168
00:51:35,322 --> 00:51:39,487
[cheers and applause]

1169
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:49,042
I've talked a lot about
being on my phone.

1170
00:51:49,108 --> 00:51:51,944
And I've only mentioned
the internet a couple times.

1171
00:51:52,011 --> 00:51:57,850
I think-- I think it's important
to point out that the internet,

1172
00:51:57,917 --> 00:52:00,420
all it is is an amplifier,
you know?

1173
00:52:00,486 --> 00:52:04,090
When it-- when the internet came
along, it changed everything.

1174
00:52:04,157 --> 00:52:06,292
It changed the world
as we live in it.

1175
00:52:06,359 --> 00:52:07,960
It changed what we care about.

1176
00:52:08,027 --> 00:52:09,696
It changed our priorities.
All that stuff.

1177
00:52:09,762 --> 00:52:12,765
But all it really is,
deep down, is a transformer.

1178
00:52:12,832 --> 00:52:14,600
It's an amplifier.

1179
00:52:14,667 --> 00:52:15,835
And if you want to do good,

1180
00:52:15,902 --> 00:52:17,437
it's going to help you
do more good

1181
00:52:17,503 --> 00:52:18,871
than you've ever done
in your entire life.

1182
00:52:18,938 --> 00:52:20,139
You're going to reach people

1183
00:52:20,206 --> 00:52:21,774
that you never
could have otherwise.

1184
00:52:21,841 --> 00:52:24,143
And if you want to do evil,
it is gonna take you

1185
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:27,447
to a darker place
than you could ever imagine.

1186
00:52:29,248 --> 00:52:32,618
Like for the good things, right?

1187
00:52:32,685 --> 00:52:35,088
As a good example,
there was a little girl--

1188
00:52:35,154 --> 00:52:36,756
some of you may have
even seen the story.

1189
00:52:36,823 --> 00:52:40,994
There was a little girl
that was eight years old,

1190
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:43,162
and she had brain cancer,

1191
00:52:43,229 --> 00:52:45,431
and her parents
didn't have a lot of money,

1192
00:52:45,498 --> 00:52:47,367
and they didn't have
the best insurance.

1193
00:52:47,433 --> 00:52:49,135
So as Americans,

1194
00:52:49,202 --> 00:52:52,138
we were gonna let her die.

1195
00:52:52,205 --> 00:52:54,107
That is what we do here,
all right?

1196
00:52:54,173 --> 00:52:55,875
She, obviously,

1197
00:52:55,942 --> 00:52:58,444
being eight
and having a bad brain

1198
00:52:58,511 --> 00:53:00,947
and not having money
was irresponsible.

1199
00:53:01,014 --> 00:53:02,281
She should have
pulled herself up

1200
00:53:02,348 --> 00:53:04,250
by her seven-year-old bootstraps

1201
00:53:04,317 --> 00:53:05,485
and made enough money

1202
00:53:05,551 --> 00:53:08,488
to support her
dumb cancer brain, right?

1203
00:53:10,256 --> 00:53:13,026
That's American dogma, okay?

1204
00:53:13,092 --> 00:53:15,128
So we were gonna let her die,
but she said,

1205
00:53:15,194 --> 00:53:18,164
"No-- no, I'm not going to die,
all right?

1206
00:53:18,231 --> 00:53:20,299
Not without a fight, okay?"

1207
00:53:20,366 --> 00:53:23,636
And so she decided
to sell lemonade.

1208
00:53:23,703 --> 00:53:25,905
She was going to sell lemonade
to raise money

1209
00:53:25,938 --> 00:53:27,440
for her surgery, right?

1210
00:53:27,507 --> 00:53:30,643
Which is adorable but, sweetie,
that's not gonna cut it.

1211
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:32,045
Unless you are charging

1212
00:53:32,111 --> 00:53:34,480
champagne levels
for this lemonade

1213
00:53:34,547 --> 00:53:37,183
or have child soldier
factory levels of it

1214
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:39,052
being pumped out and produced,
you're not gonna make it.

1215
00:53:39,118 --> 00:53:40,920
I'm sorry.

1216
00:53:40,953 --> 00:53:42,789
But as she was
selling the lemonade,

1217
00:53:42,922 --> 00:53:46,059
every person that she sold
a cup of lemonade to,

1218
00:53:46,125 --> 00:53:47,393
she told her story.

1219
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:49,462
She told them why
she was selling the lemonade.

1220
00:53:49,529 --> 00:53:51,164
And then those people
started to tell people.

1221
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:53,700
And then through Facebook,
Instagram, Twitter,

1222
00:53:53,766 --> 00:53:55,935
someone started a GoFundMe
for this little girl.

1223
00:53:56,002 --> 00:53:57,670
And then she blew
the amount of money

1224
00:53:57,737 --> 00:54:01,240
that she needed for her surgery
out of the water, right?

1225
00:54:01,307 --> 00:54:03,265
Which is great.
That's amazing.

1226
00:54:03,285 --> 00:54:05,244
That's the power
of the internet.

1227
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:07,280
That's the ability
for us to connect.

1228
00:54:07,347 --> 00:54:09,615
When we all have access
to each other,

1229
00:54:09,682 --> 00:54:11,284
we can make an impact.

1230
00:54:11,351 --> 00:54:13,519
We could change
each other's lives, you know?

1231
00:54:14,921 --> 00:54:17,156
But there's also a bad side.

1232
00:54:17,223 --> 00:54:19,192
We all know it.

1233
00:54:20,326 --> 00:54:21,995
When I was in high school,

1234
00:54:22,061 --> 00:54:23,930
there was this group of kids

1235
00:54:23,997 --> 00:54:26,432
that they were cool,
and I liked them,

1236
00:54:26,499 --> 00:54:29,369
and I liked that they liked me,
but they terrified me

1237
00:54:29,435 --> 00:54:32,171
because all they ever did
was prank each other.

1238
00:54:32,238 --> 00:54:34,340
And it was, like--
it was, like, too hardcore,

1239
00:54:34,407 --> 00:54:35,888
and it was really mean,

1240
00:54:35,908 --> 00:54:38,911
and it weirdly always
brought them closer together,

1241
00:54:38,978 --> 00:54:41,381
but it terrified me, you know?

1242
00:54:41,447 --> 00:54:43,416
'Cause they were heinous
to each other,

1243
00:54:43,483 --> 00:54:46,285
but it somehow
just strengthened their bond.

1244
00:54:46,352 --> 00:54:49,022
So I was glad
that they liked me,

1245
00:54:49,088 --> 00:54:52,125
but I didn't want to be
in the group.

1246
00:54:52,191 --> 00:54:53,292
And it was four of them.

1247
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:54,627
It was two guys,
and it was two girls.

1248
00:54:54,694 --> 00:54:56,362
And normally, like,
the coming-of-age story

1249
00:54:56,429 --> 00:54:57,864
would tell you that they're
all gonna hook up,

1250
00:54:57,897 --> 00:55:00,633
but that's not what happened.

1251
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:02,969
Everyone in the group
had a different

1252
00:55:03,036 --> 00:55:05,738
significant other outside
the group except for one girl.

1253
00:55:05,872 --> 00:55:07,073
Her name was Beth.

1254
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:09,175
And it was hard for Beth
to find somebody

1255
00:55:09,242 --> 00:55:10,877
'cause she was too intense.

1256
00:55:10,897 --> 00:55:12,512
She was a lot.

1257
00:55:12,578 --> 00:55:15,548
You know, she just-- she always
felt the need to up the ante.

1258
00:55:15,615 --> 00:55:19,352
Take things further
than they should go, you know?

1259
00:55:19,419 --> 00:55:21,287
Until she met a guy.

1260
00:55:21,354 --> 00:55:23,323
She met a guy on the internet,

1261
00:55:23,389 --> 00:55:25,191
and they hit it off immediately.

1262
00:55:25,258 --> 00:55:26,626
She thought he was cute.

1263
00:55:26,693 --> 00:55:28,995
They had the same
sense of humor.

1264
00:55:29,062 --> 00:55:31,464
They-- they wanted to go

1265
00:55:31,531 --> 00:55:34,634
and travel the same places.

1266
00:55:34,701 --> 00:55:36,269
And every day,
she would come to school,

1267
00:55:36,336 --> 00:55:37,637
and she would tell us
about this.

1268
00:55:37,704 --> 00:55:39,038
She would tell us, like,

1269
00:55:39,105 --> 00:55:41,774
"Oh, you know, he's so cool.
I like him so much.

1270
00:55:41,908 --> 00:55:43,710
And here's what we talked
about and everything."

1271
00:55:43,843 --> 00:55:45,144
And then Friday came,

1272
00:55:45,211 --> 00:55:48,047
and on Friday, she told me

1273
00:55:48,114 --> 00:55:50,283
that he wanted to meet
on Saturday.

1274
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:52,018
And I told her, "Oh.

1275
00:55:52,085 --> 00:55:54,654
"Don't do that.

1276
00:55:54,721 --> 00:55:56,055
That is a terrible idea."

1277
00:55:56,122 --> 00:55:57,557
Because I should point out--

1278
00:55:57,623 --> 00:55:59,759
this isn't online dating
in 2021.

1279
00:55:59,859 --> 00:56:05,264
This is online dating
in 2008, okay?

1280
00:56:05,331 --> 00:56:08,134
In 2021, there's bios.
There's mutual friends.

1281
00:56:08,201 --> 00:56:10,470
There's pictures
from multiple angles.

1282
00:56:10,536 --> 00:56:12,972
In 2008, all you are getting
with online dating

1283
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:15,241
was a description that was
hopefully accurate enough

1284
00:56:15,308 --> 00:56:17,377
to give the police.

1285
00:56:18,878 --> 00:56:21,314
And so I told her,
"No, don't go."

1286
00:56:21,381 --> 00:56:24,183
Because I should point out

1287
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:27,020
this guy didn't give her
an address to come to.

1288
00:56:27,086 --> 00:56:28,721
He said, "Meet me
in this neighborhood

1289
00:56:28,788 --> 00:56:31,624
through this alley
through this door."

1290
00:56:31,691 --> 00:56:35,061
And I was like, "You honestly
making it too easy to kill you.

1291
00:56:35,128 --> 00:56:36,295
"Do not go.

1292
00:56:36,362 --> 00:56:39,232
That sounds like
a murderer, okay?"

1293
00:56:41,034 --> 00:56:43,836
But she-- she was young,
and she was in love,

1294
00:56:43,870 --> 00:56:45,438
and so she went.

1295
00:56:45,505 --> 00:56:47,607
She went to that neighborhood

1296
00:56:47,674 --> 00:56:49,842
through that alley
through that door.

1297
00:56:49,876 --> 00:56:51,844
And when she walked
through that door,

1298
00:56:51,878 --> 00:56:54,180
it was a funeral home.

1299
00:56:54,247 --> 00:56:55,515
She was so confused.

1300
00:56:55,581 --> 00:56:56,749
You know, she was
looking around at everything.

1301
00:56:56,849 --> 00:56:58,418
She walked around
the whole funeral home,

1302
00:56:58,484 --> 00:57:02,221
and she saw that there
was only one funeral,

1303
00:57:02,288 --> 00:57:04,424
and it was his.

1304
00:57:05,925 --> 00:57:07,860
And she was so confused.
She was looking at him,

1305
00:57:07,894 --> 00:57:10,229
looking at his family
and everything.

1306
00:57:10,296 --> 00:57:12,565
She couldn't understand it.

1307
00:57:12,632 --> 00:57:15,301
And then she got a call
on her phone,

1308
00:57:15,368 --> 00:57:17,437
and it was her friends.

1309
00:57:17,503 --> 00:57:20,373
And they had pranked her.

1310
00:57:26,946 --> 00:57:30,316
You see, they found this dude's
picture in the obituary.

1311
00:57:31,484 --> 00:57:32,919
And so they took it,
and they made

1312
00:57:32,986 --> 00:57:36,089
an online profile with it,
and then they found her,

1313
00:57:36,155 --> 00:57:37,323
and then they just
chopped it up.

1314
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:38,524
They just chatted, and they--

1315
00:57:38,591 --> 00:57:40,226
because they know her so well,

1316
00:57:40,293 --> 00:57:41,728
they obviously
could make her fall

1317
00:57:41,794 --> 00:57:43,262
instantly in love with this guy.

1318
00:57:43,329 --> 00:57:45,064
They know all of the things
that she likes.

1319
00:57:45,131 --> 00:57:46,399
They know her sense of humor.

1320
00:57:46,466 --> 00:57:48,234
They know the places
that she wants to travel

1321
00:57:48,301 --> 00:57:50,637
when she gets out
of high school, you know?

1322
00:57:50,703 --> 00:57:53,439
And so they had her come there
on a Saturday--

1323
00:57:53,506 --> 00:57:56,309
Valentine's Day, by the way.

1324
00:57:58,945 --> 00:58:00,680
To come see the dead body

1325
00:58:00,747 --> 00:58:04,851
of this dude
she had fallen in love with.

1326
00:58:04,917 --> 00:58:07,253
That's terrible.

1327
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:10,390
That is how dark
the internet can be.

1328
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,496
That is what happens

1329
00:58:16,562 --> 00:58:19,846
when we all have access
to each other.

1330
00:58:19,866 --> 00:58:22,869
We can change each other's
lives for the worse.

1331
00:58:24,671 --> 00:58:26,439
I know right now
you feel bad for Beth.

1332
00:58:26,506 --> 00:58:28,364
Don't.
Okay?

1333
00:58:28,384 --> 00:58:30,243
She got 'em back.

1334
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:33,179
Over the course of a decade,
she...

1335
00:58:33,246 --> 00:58:36,506
banged all of their dads.

1336
00:58:36,526 --> 00:58:39,786
[cheers and applause]

1337
00:58:42,522 --> 00:58:44,424
I told you she was intense.

1338
00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:47,060
She felt the need to up the ante

1339
00:58:47,126 --> 00:58:49,228
'cause that's not all she did.

1340
00:58:49,295 --> 00:58:51,597
She married one.

1341
00:58:53,099 --> 00:58:56,336
And we honestly don't know
if that's still part of it.

1342
00:58:56,402 --> 00:58:59,372
Maybe she loves this man,
or maybe she's like,

1343
00:58:59,439 --> 00:59:00,974
"You got me good in high school,

1344
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:03,376
"and now, I'm your mom.

1345
00:59:10,616 --> 00:59:12,552
"I'm going to write you
out of the will.

1346
00:59:12,618 --> 00:59:16,856
Ha, ha-ha-ha, haha-haha, haha."

1347
00:59:16,923 --> 00:59:18,624
Guys, I'm Josh Johnson.
Thanks so much.

1348
00:59:18,691 --> 00:59:19,726
You have a great night.

1349
00:59:19,859 --> 00:59:21,894
Thank you so much
for coming out.

1350
00:59:21,961 --> 00:59:24,497
I can't believe we did it.
We did it!

1351
00:59:24,564 --> 00:59:27,000
Give it up for yourselves again.

1352
00:59:27,066 --> 00:59:28,201
Thank you all so much.

1353
00:59:28,267 --> 00:59:30,069
I appreciate it.

1354
00:59:30,136 --> 00:59:32,438
Thank you so much.

1355
00:59:32,505 --> 00:59:33,706
One second, one second.

1356
00:59:33,773 --> 00:59:35,875
[stammers]
I feel like I would--

1357
00:59:35,908 --> 00:59:37,577
I would be--

1358
00:59:37,644 --> 00:59:39,646
I'd be making a huge mistake

1359
00:59:39,712 --> 00:59:42,181
if I didn't say
an extra thing right now.

1360
00:59:42,248 --> 00:59:44,917
So a lot of you can't know.

1361
00:59:44,984 --> 00:59:47,020
This thing was supposed
to happen a year ago.

1362
00:59:47,086 --> 00:59:48,821
And because of the pandemic,

1363
00:59:48,855 --> 00:59:50,490
we had to hold it and hold it,
and we wanted to do it

1364
00:59:50,556 --> 00:59:52,392
in a way
that made everybody safe

1365
00:59:52,458 --> 00:59:54,060
and everybody could still
have a good time.

1366
00:59:54,127 --> 00:59:56,663
And so I-- I'm not-- I'm not--
I know I'm up here,

1367
00:59:56,729 --> 00:59:58,898
but I'm not the only one
that put a lot of work

1368
00:59:58,965 --> 01:00:00,433
and a lot of sweat
and tears of people

1369
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:01,634
who couldn't even
be here tonight.

1370
01:00:01,701 --> 01:00:03,536
They have to, like,
Zoom in from LA,

1371
01:00:03,603 --> 01:00:04,604
so I hope I don't have a lag.

1372
01:00:04,671 --> 01:00:05,905
They'll think I was bombing.

1373
01:00:05,972 --> 01:00:09,742
But, like-- but please,
I want you to give it up

1374
01:00:09,842 --> 01:00:11,744
for Comedy Central,
give it up for Viacom,

1375
01:00:11,844 --> 01:00:14,013
give it up for your director,

1376
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:16,449
David Paul Meyer.

1377
01:00:16,516 --> 01:00:18,885
[cheers and applause]

1378
01:00:18,951 --> 01:00:21,187
Give it up for all
the amazing people

1379
01:00:21,254 --> 01:00:22,955
that have kept us safe tonight,

1380
01:00:23,022 --> 01:00:26,726
every person
that has kept your mask on.

1381
01:00:26,859 --> 01:00:28,961
All the stuff.
Please.

1382
01:00:32,999 --> 01:00:34,500
And-- and one last thing.

1383
01:00:34,567 --> 01:00:38,004
I-- this has been
so important to me.

1384
01:00:38,071 --> 01:00:40,740
It's been one of the most
important things in my life.

1385
01:00:40,873 --> 01:00:42,108
I grew up watching
Comedy Central.

1386
01:00:42,175 --> 01:00:43,443
I grew up watching specials.

1387
01:00:43,509 --> 01:00:45,979
And so now to have one
is absolutely insane.

1388
01:00:46,045 --> 01:00:49,215
It's-- it's a dream come true,
and you were all part of that.

1389
01:00:49,282 --> 01:00:52,552
And I wanna thank you
so much for being here

1390
01:00:52,618 --> 01:00:53,920
and for being part of it.

1391
01:00:53,987 --> 01:00:55,555
You mean the world to me.
You really do.

1392
01:00:55,621 --> 01:00:57,824
And honestly,

1393
01:00:57,857 --> 01:00:59,659
if last year taught us anything,

1394
01:00:59,726 --> 01:01:02,562
it is to do whatever it is
that you want.

1395
01:01:02,628 --> 01:01:04,931
Whatever it is,
if you think you can't do it,

1396
01:01:04,998 --> 01:01:08,267
if you think you won't be able
to do it, you will eventually.

1397
01:01:08,334 --> 01:01:10,703
You just give it time,
and-- and I promise you,

1398
01:01:10,837 --> 01:01:12,138
if you don't give up,

1399
01:01:12,205 --> 01:01:15,208
I promise you you can
make things happen, okay?

1400
01:01:15,274 --> 01:01:18,478
A couple people have said that
I inspired them to do comedy

1401
01:01:18,544 --> 01:01:20,013
and everything,
but I hope I can inspire you

1402
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:22,148
to do whatever it is
that you want.

1403
01:01:22,215 --> 01:01:24,050
So important, especially now.

1404
01:01:24,117 --> 01:01:25,852
Life is precious,

1405
01:01:25,885 --> 01:01:28,054
and it's not promised, you know?

1406
01:01:28,121 --> 01:01:29,455
I've had people ask me

1407
01:01:29,522 --> 01:01:31,357
what I feel like
my life would be like

1408
01:01:31,424 --> 01:01:33,693
if I didn't follow my dreams,
you know?

1409
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,895
If I didn't get on a plane
from Louisiana

1410
01:01:35,962 --> 01:01:38,731
and move to Chicago
to start doing comedy

1411
01:01:38,865 --> 01:01:42,502
and just be dirt poor
and doing open mics,

1412
01:01:42,568 --> 01:01:45,038
until I-- I finally got
comfortable in Chicago

1413
01:01:45,104 --> 01:01:46,673
and then I was scared
to move to New York,

1414
01:01:46,739 --> 01:01:48,274
but I did that too.

1415
01:01:48,341 --> 01:01:51,010
And people asked me what-- what
I think my life would be like

1416
01:01:51,077 --> 01:01:53,780
if-- if I didn't get
on those planes,

1417
01:01:53,846 --> 01:01:55,548
if I didn't take those chances,

1418
01:01:55,615 --> 01:01:58,518
if I didn't meet Trevor Noah.

1419
01:01:58,584 --> 01:02:00,186
And I have to tell them

1420
01:02:00,253 --> 01:02:02,955
I guess we'll never know.

1421
01:02:03,022 --> 01:02:05,024
Thank you so much.
You guys have a great night.

1422
01:02:05,091 --> 01:02:06,225
I appreciate it.

1423
01:02:06,292 --> 01:02:08,261
Thank you so much.

1424
01:02:08,328 --> 01:02:11,064
