1
00:01:04,967 --> 00:01:06,446
Charlie, come see!

2
00:01:06,647 --> 00:01:08,524
- Can't you knock?
- Come!

3
00:01:08,847 --> 00:01:10,678
Well, I have to finish this.

4
00:01:10,847 --> 00:01:13,520
I built a wall for my fort
and it is very strong.

5
00:01:14,127 --> 00:01:16,925
Crazy, for a wall of cushions.

6
00:01:17,527 --> 00:01:19,882
Did I tell you about the Knights
of the Round Table?

7
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:21,275
Later.

8
00:01:21,447 --> 00:01:23,278
They are safe
thanks to the wall.

9
00:01:23,447 --> 00:01:26,917
Even the dog-men who
live in the dungeons.

10
00:01:27,647 --> 00:01:29,160
What are you talking about?

11
00:01:29,327 --> 00:01:30,476
<i>Breakfast!</i>

12
00:01:30,647 --> 00:01:32,126
Serious. Go away.

13
00:01:37,287 --> 00:01:38,356
Benjamin.

14
00:01:45,887 --> 00:01:48,117
Epees, nunchucks, ninjas,

15
00:01:48,287 --> 00:01:50,562
dungeons, dragons, moats
and knights.

16
00:01:51,087 --> 00:01:52,566
Let him go.

17
00:01:52,887 --> 00:01:53,956
Leave him.

18
00:01:54,687 --> 00:01:56,803
I thought you had finished
your homework?

19
00:01:56,967 --> 00:01:58,480
It's extra.

20
00:02:01,127 --> 00:02:02,879
Did you destroy the wall?

21
00:02:03,287 --> 00:02:05,596
I told you not to use
those cushions.

22
00:02:06,207 --> 00:02:07,686
But my forte?

23
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:09,884
Put it back in place.

24
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:30,161
To think that your mother
still cooks your lunches.

25
00:02:30,327 --> 00:02:32,477
My mother stopped in CM2.

26
00:02:32,647 --> 00:02:34,239
And you survived.

27
00:02:34,527 --> 00:02:36,324
- Come on tell me.
- What?

28
00:02:36,847 --> 00:02:38,439
Are you admitted?

29
00:02:39,247 --> 00:02:41,087
- What are you talking about?
- What a bastard!

30
00:02:41,247 --> 00:02:43,044
Are you admitted to Columbia?

31
00:02:44,727 --> 00:02:47,116
- I told you!
- I don't believe it yet.

32
00:02:47,647 --> 00:02:48,762
Let's skip school!

33
00:02:48,927 --> 00:02:50,155
I made extra.

34
00:02:50,327 --> 00:02:52,522
We do not care. You are admitted.

35
00:03:36,847 --> 00:03:39,156
I'm so glad you could come.

36
00:03:39,327 --> 00:03:41,318
My neck hurts a lot.

37
00:03:42,047 --> 00:03:43,526
A lot of stress.

38
00:03:45,527 --> 00:03:47,916
My husband used
the paper shredder yesterday,

39
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:49,640
and he fell on his foot.

40
00:03:49,927 --> 00:03:51,326
It's awful.

41
00:03:52,247 --> 00:03:53,441
12 kilos.

42
00:03:54,847 --> 00:03:57,520
I had never
heard him swear so much.

43
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:07,044
Something is wrong?

44
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:08,641
No, it's fine.

45
00:04:12,727 --> 00:04:15,287
We spent
the whole night in the emergency room.

46
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,287
Suzie?

47
00:04:49,527 --> 00:04:50,642
How are you?

48
00:04:55,407 --> 00:04:56,635
My God!

49
00:05:43,607 --> 00:05:46,405
In the name of the Father, of the Son
and of the Holy Spirit.

50
00:05:47,607 --> 00:05:50,201
Lord, hear our prayer.

51
00:05:51,207 --> 00:05:54,404
Into your hands we place
the soul of Suzie Conrad.

52
00:05:55,407 --> 00:05:57,045
Cherish her to heaven as

53
00:05:57,207 --> 00:05:59,004
we cherished it on earth.

54
00:05:59,487 --> 00:06:01,603
Mary, full of grace,

55
00:06:01,807 --> 00:06:03,240
the lord is with you.

56
00:06:03,407 --> 00:06:05,045
Blessed are you,

57
00:06:05,207 --> 00:06:07,482
and blessed be the
fruit of your womb.

58
00:06:23,607 --> 00:06:25,837
- Have you seen Ben?
- I put him to bed.

59
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:28,158
You could have warned me.

60
00:06:28,567 --> 00:06:29,636
Sorry.

61
00:06:36,847 --> 00:06:38,963
You should rest.
Won't you sit down?

62
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:40,759
Give me the plate.

63
00:06:41,687 --> 00:06:43,962
No one will blame you
if you rest.

64
00:06:44,367 --> 00:06:45,880
Let me do.

65
00:06:46,567 --> 00:06:47,397
Shit!

66
00:06:47,567 --> 00:06:49,080
Put some water.

67
00:07:21,167 --> 00:07:22,805
Charlie, stop!

68
00:07:23,607 --> 00:07:24,801
It'll be OK.

69
00:07:51,887 --> 00:07:53,320
Do not leave.

70
00:08:17,767 --> 00:08:20,327
ONE YEAR LATER

71
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:24,800
Your mom and I
loved coming here.

72
00:08:26,087 --> 00:08:28,601
We came every day, to sit down,

73
00:08:29,887 --> 00:08:30,922
talk, laugh

74
00:08:31,087 --> 00:08:32,486
and make plans.

75
00:08:33,327 --> 00:08:34,919
You wanted to do "Law".

76
00:08:37,167 --> 00:08:38,759
And she met your father.

77
00:08:40,847 --> 00:08:42,917
He didn't even come
to the funeral.

78
00:08:43,447 --> 00:08:44,846
Does that surprise you?

79
00:08:50,647 --> 00:08:51,875
Comment from Ben?

80
00:08:52,967 --> 00:08:54,161
He's fine.

81
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:56,758
He has some problems at school.

82
00:08:57,487 --> 00:08:59,955
The teacher says he's withdrawn.

83
00:09:01,687 --> 00:09:03,962
He may need a change of scenery.

84
00:09:05,487 --> 00:09:07,876
Ben could live with me.

85
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:11,400
Thanks, we'll manage.

86
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:12,716
And college?

87
00:09:12,887 --> 00:09:14,036
I pushed back.

88
00:09:14,207 --> 00:09:16,437
- And the money?
- I work at the restaurant.

89
00:09:16,607 --> 00:09:18,404
Plus the money mom left us.

90
00:09:18,607 --> 00:09:20,802
I know you want to take care of it,

91
00:09:21,807 --> 00:09:23,843
but you are so young.
Things will change.

92
00:09:24,007 --> 00:09:26,805
Let me take Ben
for a few months.

93
00:09:27,207 --> 00:09:28,207
No thanks...

94
00:09:28,487 --> 00:09:32,002
While you decide
what you want to do.

95
00:09:32,607 --> 00:09:34,643
- I know what I want.
- You're only 19.

96
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:36,206
I know what I want.

97
00:09:37,407 --> 00:09:38,840
I try to help.

98
00:09:39,007 --> 00:09:41,396
So stop trying to
take it from me.

99
00:09:42,687 --> 00:09:45,406
I'm sorry, Louise.
I appreciate your interest,

100
00:09:45,807 --> 00:09:47,638
but I talked about it with Ben.

101
00:09:47,807 --> 00:09:49,206
I will take care of him.

102
00:10:10,087 --> 00:10:11,122
Go away

103
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:17,282
Wake up.

104
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:20,441
Everything's good,

105
00:10:20,607 --> 00:10:22,199
it's just a dream.

106
00:10:23,527 --> 00:10:25,518
Take a deep breath.

107
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:28,927
GOOD.

108
00:10:29,047 --> 00:10:30,366
Everything's good.

109
00:10:31,687 --> 00:10:33,086
Do you want to tell me?

110
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:37,758
I was in a castle.

111
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:42,761
Everyone was there, even you.

112
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:47,839
It was very dark.

113
00:10:48,527 --> 00:10:50,916
Everyone was turning
into a vampire,

114
00:10:51,327 --> 00:10:52,726
like Dracula.

115
00:10:55,167 --> 00:10:56,805
And I looked at you

116
00:10:57,007 --> 00:10:59,601
and you also turned
into a vampire.

117
00:11:01,407 --> 00:11:03,045
It's just a nightmare.

118
00:11:03,207 --> 00:11:05,004
It can't happen.

119
00:11:05,927 --> 00:11:07,599
I was so scared.

120
00:11:07,927 --> 00:11:09,406
These are stories.

121
00:11:09,607 --> 00:11:11,802
Dracula and vampires
do not exist.

122
00:11:13,007 --> 00:11:14,565
How do you know?

123
00:11:14,727 --> 00:11:17,002
I read it in my books.

124
00:11:17,807 --> 00:11:20,162
Dracula was just
a mean old king,

125
00:11:20,327 --> 00:11:23,319
called Vlad, who liked
skewered rats.

126
00:11:25,527 --> 00:11:26,721
Do not move.

127
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,358
Close your eyes and hold out your hand.

128
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:52,997
Vampires hate garlic.

129
00:12:04,607 --> 00:12:06,837
APARTMENT A LOUER.

130
00:12:10,567 --> 00:12:14,276
You came at the right time.
This apartment is renting very quickly.

131
00:12:20,287 --> 00:12:22,243
People love trees.

132
00:12:22,407 --> 00:12:24,682
It's a bit of a tree house.

133
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,363
- Is it a quiet place?
- Yes very.

134
00:12:27,967 --> 00:12:28,967
Alright.

135
00:12:29,167 --> 00:12:30,805
And, if you're wondering,

136
00:12:30,967 --> 00:12:33,162
these pretty brown furniture
are included.

137
00:12:33,967 --> 00:12:36,356
I begged the owner
to get rid of it,

138
00:12:36,767 --> 00:12:40,282
but it's the type to drive
until the wheels fall off.

139
00:12:45,487 --> 00:12:47,523
- You remind me of someone.
- Ah good?

140
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:51,195
Were you at Bat Yam Temple
on Sunday?

141
00:12:51,607 --> 00:12:52,722
I was there.

142
00:12:53,007 --> 00:12:54,235
I was saying to myself.

143
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:55,760
The first time, right?

144
00:12:55,927 --> 00:12:57,599
The first time in a long time.

145
00:12:58,207 --> 00:12:59,640
You go back home?

146
00:12:59,807 --> 00:13:00,922
Somehow.

147
00:13:03,327 --> 00:13:04,726
I'm interested.

148
00:13:05,287 --> 00:13:06,287
Awesome.

149
00:13:06,407 --> 00:13:07,999
I give you a form.

150
00:13:08,527 --> 00:13:09,801
Here's my card.

151
00:13:11,527 --> 00:13:13,916
My personal number is on the back.

152
00:13:14,407 --> 00:13:15,407
THANKS.

153
00:13:15,607 --> 00:13:17,199
Shall we finish the visit?

154
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:30,038
Another box for Ben.

155
00:13:30,967 --> 00:13:32,878
His room looks
like a homeless shelter.

156
00:13:33,047 --> 00:13:34,844
Are you ready for tonight?

157
00:13:35,967 --> 00:13:37,161
Party?

158
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:38,682
Party...

159
00:13:38,887 --> 00:13:40,559
- You promised.
- There's Ben.

160
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:43,082
You told me that Louise was keeping it.

161
00:13:43,887 --> 00:13:45,684
I don't want to party.

162
00:13:45,967 --> 00:13:47,878
You come and that's it.

163
00:13:48,167 --> 00:13:49,600
I never have fun with it.

164
00:13:49,767 --> 00:13:51,723
Of course, with this attitude.

165
00:13:51,887 --> 00:13:55,118
You can't spend your weekends
reading old stuff,

166
00:13:55,287 --> 00:13:57,198
it's not good for your health.

167
00:13:57,367 --> 00:13:58,766
I do not know anyone.

168
00:13:59,567 --> 00:14:01,159
You know me, me.

169
00:14:03,567 --> 00:14:05,478
I pick you up at 8 o'clock?

170
00:14:27,007 --> 00:14:29,680
That idiot Miss Kessle
put me in the corner.

171
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:35,965
Cool, ton dragon!

172
00:14:36,127 --> 00:14:37,526
I can draw?

173
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,080
Want one?

174
00:15:22,207 --> 00:15:24,402
- Why are we here?
- To have fun.

175
00:15:26,807 --> 00:15:28,081
What do you want?

176
00:15:28,487 --> 00:15:29,886
We have beer

177
00:15:30,087 --> 00:15:31,805
and... beer.

178
00:15:33,087 --> 00:15:35,282
- I do not want anything.
- You'll be unnerved.

179
00:15:35,487 --> 00:15:37,000
It's OK. Drink.

180
00:15:37,287 --> 00:15:38,800
You conduirai.

181
00:15:39,687 --> 00:15:41,882
Is it for you or for me?

182
00:15:44,807 --> 00:15:46,206
It's not for me.

183
00:15:46,407 --> 00:15:47,601
You never know.

184
00:15:48,087 --> 00:15:49,281
Look people.

185
00:15:51,007 --> 00:15:52,406
You are here.

186
00:15:52,687 --> 00:15:54,086
I didn't choose.

187
00:15:59,007 --> 00:16:00,804
- It's for you.
- You think?

188
00:16:01,407 --> 00:16:02,407
You go-y.

189
00:16:02,487 --> 00:16:03,487
You're sure?

190
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,199
- My teeth?
- Perfect.

191
00:17:23,527 --> 00:17:25,358
Is it the line for the toilets?

192
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:29,444
Do you have it for a long time?

193
00:17:43,887 --> 00:17:45,206
<i>Move on!</i>

194
00:17:54,047 --> 00:17:57,164
Whore! There are people
who want to pee!

195
00:18:36,807 --> 00:18:38,320
It's dead today.

196
00:18:42,407 --> 00:18:43,522
Are you doing well?

197
00:18:45,407 --> 00:18:46,442
For what?

198
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:49,318
You were tense last night.

199
00:18:49,527 --> 00:18:50,527
How are you.

200
00:18:50,927 --> 00:18:52,246
If you want to talk...

201
00:18:52,447 --> 00:18:53,447
How are you.

202
00:18:56,967 --> 00:18:58,958
Sit where you want.

203
00:19:01,887 --> 00:19:03,115
I will be back.

204
00:19:35,167 --> 00:19:36,805
What's good?

205
00:19:38,607 --> 00:19:40,120
What did you take?

206
00:19:41,327 --> 00:19:43,318
Turkey club on wholemeal bread.

207
00:19:43,727 --> 00:19:44,727
It looks good.

208
00:19:45,927 --> 00:19:47,599
I made my choice.

209
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:03,719
Want company?

210
00:20:07,527 --> 00:20:08,676
You're sure?

211
00:20:13,807 --> 00:20:15,081
My name is Jordan.

212
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,247
Charlie.

213
00:20:16,367 --> 00:20:17,641
What are you reading?

214
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,844
"The Stories" of Herodotus.

215
00:20:20,847 --> 00:20:22,166
Ancient Greece?

216
00:20:22,447 --> 00:20:23,447
Exact.

217
00:20:23,567 --> 00:20:25,842
I tried, but I didn't like it.

218
00:20:26,647 --> 00:20:27,647
For what?

219
00:20:27,967 --> 00:20:29,195
It's too dry.

220
00:20:29,367 --> 00:20:30,959
I prefer literature.

221
00:20:31,447 --> 00:20:32,447
For what?

222
00:20:33,647 --> 00:20:35,365
It's humid.

223
00:20:38,767 --> 00:20:40,086
I'm kidding.

224
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:42,479
Do you prefer novels?

225
00:20:42,687 --> 00:20:43,881
I am a writer.

226
00:20:44,287 --> 00:20:45,481
What are you writing?

227
00:20:46,007 --> 00:20:47,804
It depends on my desire.

228
00:20:48,327 --> 00:20:50,158
Poetry, short stories.

229
00:20:50,327 --> 00:20:52,238
Sometimes I work on my novel.

230
00:20:52,407 --> 00:20:53,522
A novel?

231
00:20:54,007 --> 00:20:55,998
It's based on my travels.

232
00:20:56,527 --> 00:20:58,324
The places visited,
the people met.

233
00:20:58,927 --> 00:21:00,724
It's very "Jack Kerouac".

234
00:21:02,647 --> 00:21:04,478
You want to drink something?

235
00:21:04,767 --> 00:21:06,166
A root beer.

236
00:21:12,767 --> 00:21:14,246
You travel a lot?

237
00:21:15,447 --> 00:21:17,039
You could say that.

238
00:21:21,887 --> 00:21:23,366
Let me summarize.

239
00:21:23,527 --> 00:21:25,040
You went to visit Mexico,

240
00:21:25,207 --> 00:21:27,323
and you ended up staying a year?

241
00:21:28,927 --> 00:21:31,043
- Why are you gone?
- My car was stolen.

242
00:21:31,647 --> 00:21:32,966
Did you file a complaint?

243
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:34,759
It's no use there.

244
00:21:35,167 --> 00:21:37,158
Besides, the time had come.

245
00:21:37,367 --> 00:21:38,959
I took a bus ticket,

246
00:21:39,367 --> 00:21:40,436
and here I am.

247
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:42,561
Why here?

248
00:21:43,047 --> 00:21:44,639
I have an old friend.

249
00:21:47,447 --> 00:21:49,165
Some recommendations?

250
00:21:49,967 --> 00:21:51,161
What do you mean?

251
00:21:51,767 --> 00:21:53,166
Where are we having fun?

252
00:21:54,247 --> 00:21:55,396
I dunno.

253
00:21:55,567 --> 00:21:56,761
You live here?

254
00:21:59,647 --> 00:22:01,046
I do not go out much.

255
00:22:01,567 --> 00:22:02,841
Tell me charlie

256
00:22:03,167 --> 00:22:05,556
why this interest in
ancient Greece?

257
00:22:06,767 --> 00:22:08,837
No one had ever asked me.

258
00:22:09,247 --> 00:22:10,839
There is always a first time.

259
00:22:12,687 --> 00:22:15,076
Because of everything
they've done.

260
00:22:15,607 --> 00:22:16,835
The Greeks anticipated

261
00:22:17,007 --> 00:22:19,680
thinking in many areas;
democracy, philosophy,

262
00:22:20,087 --> 00:22:22,078
theater and even literature.

263
00:22:22,807 --> 00:22:24,081
You are interesting.

264
00:22:25,607 --> 00:22:27,802
You will be one of the characters
in my book.

265
00:22:28,207 --> 00:22:30,004
Good luck.

266
00:22:51,607 --> 00:22:53,677
<i>Hello, this is PJ.
Leave a message.</i>

267
00:22:58,047 --> 00:22:59,605
I was hoping to bump into you.

268
00:23:00,127 --> 00:23:01,958
I know it's been a long time.

269
00:23:02,127 --> 00:23:04,197
I wanted you to know
that I'm back.

270
00:23:04,927 --> 00:23:06,724
Maybe we could meet again?

271
00:23:07,527 --> 00:23:09,995
I don't really have a place
to go right now.

272
00:23:11,207 --> 00:23:14,199
<i>I'm sorry for the last time.</i>

273
00:23:16,327 --> 00:23:18,124
<i>I know that...</i>

274
00:23:18,327 --> 00:23:19,806
<i>it ended badly.</i>

275
00:23:20,007 --> 00:23:21,122
Finally...

276
00:23:23,127 --> 00:23:25,197
Call me, same number.

277
00:23:29,887 --> 00:23:32,117
My friend does not pick up,
I wanted to surprise him.

278
00:23:32,527 --> 00:23:33,721
Where are you going?

279
00:23:33,927 --> 00:23:35,201
Looking for my brother.

280
00:23:35,527 --> 00:23:37,722
Can I come with you
until he calls back?

281
00:23:46,847 --> 00:23:48,405
Vas-y Ben, monte.

282
00:23:48,607 --> 00:23:50,245
I'm sick in the back.

283
00:23:50,407 --> 00:23:52,204
It takes a minute.
Come on.

284
00:24:00,047 --> 00:24:02,197
Ben, voice Jordan.
Jordan, Ben.

285
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,404
Hi, how are you?

286
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:09,400
Well, say hello.

287
00:24:11,007 --> 00:24:12,007
Good morning.

288
00:24:19,287 --> 00:24:21,243
Come, I want to show you
the dungeon.

289
00:24:21,407 --> 00:24:23,443
Hold on, let me
talk to my friend.

290
00:24:23,607 --> 00:24:24,835
T'as promis!

291
00:24:25,007 --> 00:24:26,326
In a minute.

292
00:24:28,727 --> 00:24:30,126
Don't slam the door.

293
00:24:31,647 --> 00:24:32,647
Sorry,

294
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:35,042
he is not used to seeing people.

295
00:24:35,447 --> 00:24:36,926
I'll see if it's okay.

296
00:25:02,607 --> 00:25:04,279
He is fine?

297
00:25:05,887 --> 00:25:07,684
I don't know.

298
00:25:08,087 --> 00:25:09,281
Funny kid.

299
00:25:10,287 --> 00:25:11,606
It's your mother?

300
00:25:12,607 --> 00:25:14,006
She is pretty.

301
00:25:15,207 --> 00:25:16,207
THANKS.

302
00:25:16,887 --> 00:25:18,479
Where is she?

303
00:25:18,887 --> 00:25:20,206
And vacancies.

304
00:25:21,207 --> 00:25:22,606
Where is your father?

305
00:25:24,287 --> 00:25:25,800
He left.

306
00:25:34,047 --> 00:25:35,047
THANKS.

307
00:25:37,087 --> 00:25:39,282
To write a character
based on you,

308
00:25:39,567 --> 00:25:41,558
I'm going to need more info.

309
00:25:42,367 --> 00:25:43,561
Like what?

310
00:25:44,487 --> 00:25:46,876
First of all, what are you?

311
00:25:49,407 --> 00:25:50,726
What do you mean?

312
00:25:50,887 --> 00:25:52,878
Your mother looks Asian.

313
00:25:53,287 --> 00:25:54,606
She is Chinese.

314
00:25:55,407 --> 00:25:57,204
But, you're not completely Chinese.

315
00:25:57,607 --> 00:25:59,086
My father is Jewish.

316
00:25:59,607 --> 00:26:01,598
Are you half Chinese
and half Jewish?

317
00:26:04,087 --> 00:26:06,476
Doesn't your mother have to be Jewish
for you to be Jewish?

318
00:26:07,487 --> 00:26:09,284
I've heard that before.

319
00:26:09,487 --> 00:26:11,364
My mother is Catholic.

320
00:26:11,567 --> 00:26:13,364
- Sounds complex.
- It is.

321
00:26:14,967 --> 00:26:17,162
No wonder it didn't work.

322
00:26:26,407 --> 00:26:28,637
Cinnamon flavored rice cakes?

323
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:33,686
Gluten-free wheat cookies.

324
00:26:36,447 --> 00:26:38,722
Wasabi flavored dried peas?

325
00:26:41,527 --> 00:26:43,279
And past Doritos?

326
00:26:56,847 --> 00:26:58,360
Where were you?

327
00:26:58,967 --> 00:27:00,685
You didn't want to talk to me anymore.

328
00:27:00,967 --> 00:27:02,161
I want more.

329
00:27:03,567 --> 00:27:05,080
I brought you something.

330
00:27:19,807 --> 00:27:21,206
Come with me.

331
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:35,761
So!

332
00:27:36,567 --> 00:27:38,080
This is my garage...

333
00:27:38,287 --> 00:27:39,686
with a blanket.

334
00:27:40,407 --> 00:27:41,806
Smart ass.

335
00:27:44,567 --> 00:27:45,602
Sat.

336
00:27:51,647 --> 00:27:53,319
What are we doing?

337
00:27:53,487 --> 00:27:56,399
I thought we
needed a little recreation.

338
00:27:59,807 --> 00:28:01,684
Want to smoke some weed?

339
00:28:03,047 --> 00:28:04,162
Can not.

340
00:28:04,367 --> 00:28:05,367
For what?

341
00:28:05,647 --> 00:28:07,000
Because Ben is here.

342
00:28:07,167 --> 00:28:08,167
He dines.

343
00:28:08,247 --> 00:28:09,760
What if he comes here?

344
00:28:11,767 --> 00:28:12,767
Relax.

345
00:28:25,647 --> 00:28:27,239
I have never done that.

346
00:28:28,287 --> 00:28:29,287
Serious?

347
00:28:32,087 --> 00:28:33,645
You are such a nice boy.

348
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:36,805
Put it in your mouth.

349
00:28:38,127 --> 00:28:40,038
When I turn it on,
take a deep breath

350
00:28:40,207 --> 00:28:41,925
and keep the smoke
as much as you can.

351
00:28:45,407 --> 00:28:47,363
Come on, suck, suck...

352
00:28:50,767 --> 00:28:51,961
How are you?

353
00:28:53,087 --> 00:28:54,566
It's horrible.

354
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:56,767
Look at.

355
00:29:03,687 --> 00:29:04,961
You see?

356
00:29:06,447 --> 00:29:07,641
Try again.

357
00:29:22,087 --> 00:29:23,440
Once again.

358
00:29:35,687 --> 00:29:37,086
Perfect.

359
00:29:41,967 --> 00:29:44,640
Wouldn't it be great if
it was a magic carpet.

360
00:29:45,487 --> 00:29:46,556
Completely.

361
00:29:54,407 --> 00:29:55,965
Do you have a mom?

362
00:29:58,167 --> 00:29:59,680
Is she nice?

363
00:30:00,567 --> 00:30:01,886
She is okay.

364
00:30:03,287 --> 00:30:05,084
My mother was nice.

365
00:30:09,527 --> 00:30:11,597
Do you remember when we were talking?

366
00:30:12,407 --> 00:30:13,840
Enough to?

367
00:30:14,007 --> 00:30:16,202
About my mom's vacation.

368
00:30:17,807 --> 00:30:19,718
She's not on vacation.

369
00:30:20,047 --> 00:30:21,321
Where is she?

370
00:30:21,727 --> 00:30:23,046
She is dead.

371
00:30:27,607 --> 00:30:29,518
Why didn't you tell me?

372
00:30:30,247 --> 00:30:32,238
I didn't want you to know.

373
00:30:33,927 --> 00:30:36,122
Have pity on me.

374
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:43,286
Let's play a game.

375
00:30:50,607 --> 00:30:52,438
It's called "5 in 10 seconds".

376
00:30:53,287 --> 00:30:55,243
It's harder than it looks.

377
00:30:55,407 --> 00:30:56,999
The rules?

378
00:30:58,207 --> 00:31:00,801
First, I give you a category.

379
00:31:01,007 --> 00:31:02,007
Let's say...

380
00:31:02,407 --> 00:31:03,601
Superheroes.

381
00:31:04,207 --> 00:31:07,005
You have to find 5 of them,
in 10 seconds.

382
00:31:07,607 --> 00:31:08,607
Understood?

383
00:31:08,807 --> 00:31:09,807
Ready?

384
00:31:12,807 --> 00:31:13,807
Batman!

385
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:18,158
My god, this is difficult.

386
00:31:19,967 --> 00:31:21,320
All X-Men!

387
00:31:21,487 --> 00:31:22,681
It does not count.

388
00:31:24,487 --> 00:31:26,318
- I don't know.
- Finished.

389
00:31:26,487 --> 00:31:27,487
I won.

390
00:31:27,887 --> 00:31:29,081
My turn.

391
00:31:29,567 --> 00:31:30,966
Your category,

392
00:31:31,607 --> 00:31:33,279
It's the bands of the 80s.

393
00:31:37,087 --> 00:31:38,486
Guns 'N Roses?

394
00:31:39,087 --> 00:31:40,087
Guns 'N Roses?

395
00:31:40,207 --> 00:31:41,276
It counts?

396
00:31:41,487 --> 00:31:42,602
Blondie,

397
00:31:43,407 --> 00:31:44,806
Creedance Clearwater Revival!

398
00:31:45,087 --> 00:31:46,202
It's finish!

399
00:31:47,687 --> 00:31:49,086
It's very difficult.

400
00:32:04,407 --> 00:32:06,238
There was a nail.

401
00:32:23,127 --> 00:32:24,799
I do not feel good.

402
00:32:28,527 --> 00:32:29,527
And damn it!

403
00:33:08,247 --> 00:33:10,602
I must have passed out
and he left.

404
00:33:11,207 --> 00:33:12,526
He left a note?

405
00:33:12,727 --> 00:33:14,001
What a mystery...

406
00:33:27,367 --> 00:33:28,482
Hello Charlie.

407
00:33:30,327 --> 00:33:31,919
Can we talk?

408
00:33:33,727 --> 00:33:36,002
- What happened to your hand?
- Nothing.

409
00:33:36,927 --> 00:33:38,326
I hit myself.

410
00:33:38,607 --> 00:33:40,120
A doctor saw her?

411
00:33:40,607 --> 00:33:42,006
It does not hurt.

412
00:33:43,527 --> 00:33:44,846
I learned for your mother.

413
00:33:45,007 --> 00:33:46,804
It's been over a year.

414
00:33:47,207 --> 00:33:48,686
I know, I'm sorry.

415
00:33:49,007 --> 00:33:50,963
Sorry for not
coming to the funeral.

416
00:33:51,127 --> 00:33:52,799
I did not know.

417
00:33:55,287 --> 00:33:56,402
Comment from Ben?

418
00:33:57,487 --> 00:33:58,681
He's fine.

419
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,606
He had to grow up.

420
00:34:03,127 --> 00:34:04,446
I miss you.

421
00:34:05,207 --> 00:34:06,242
Awesome.

422
00:34:06,407 --> 00:34:08,204
I'll be right back, Charlie.

423
00:34:09,687 --> 00:34:11,006
I will stay.

424
00:34:11,407 --> 00:34:12,886
To help you with Ben.

425
00:34:13,287 --> 00:34:14,845
We don't need your help.

426
00:34:15,007 --> 00:34:16,042
Please.

427
00:34:16,207 --> 00:34:17,481
I am your father.

428
00:34:17,887 --> 00:34:19,605
- There are people...
- Listen!

429
00:34:19,887 --> 00:34:21,240
You are upset

430
00:34:21,407 --> 00:34:22,886
and you have the right to be.

431
00:34:23,087 --> 00:34:24,406
But I came back.

432
00:34:25,087 --> 00:34:28,284
I can't be well without
knowing if you're happy.

433
00:34:28,807 --> 00:34:30,286
I have to go.

434
00:34:36,527 --> 00:34:38,358
He says he wants to help with Ben.

435
00:34:38,527 --> 00:34:39,596
In just one time?

436
00:34:41,047 --> 00:34:42,366
Did he look good?

437
00:34:42,567 --> 00:34:43,716
I believe.

438
00:34:43,887 --> 00:34:45,479
He looked calmer.

439
00:34:45,767 --> 00:34:47,166
What are you going to do?

440
00:34:47,487 --> 00:34:48,761
I dunno.

441
00:34:48,967 --> 00:34:50,480
I don't want Ben to see it.

442
00:34:51,087 --> 00:34:52,679
It's her father, Charlie.

443
00:34:52,967 --> 00:34:54,161
<i>I do not care.</i>

444
00:34:54,367 --> 00:34:56,358
As a father,
he has custody of Ben.

445
00:34:56,887 --> 00:34:59,276
<i>Legally, he can take Ben
whenever he wants.</i>

446
00:34:59,567 --> 00:35:01,080
He left for 6 years.

447
00:35:01,687 --> 00:35:03,279
That's why he won't.

448
00:35:03,487 --> 00:35:04,487
<i>He knows</i>

449
00:35:04,687 --> 00:35:06,882
that we would sue him.

450
00:35:22,207 --> 00:35:23,560
How's your hand?

451
00:35:25,087 --> 00:35:26,486
It hurts a little.

452
00:35:27,967 --> 00:35:29,480
You fainted.

453
00:35:30,167 --> 00:35:31,282
I know.

454
00:35:32,487 --> 00:35:34,557
I wanted to put you in pajamas,

455
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:37,765
but I didn't want
you to find me too direct.

456
00:35:40,487 --> 00:35:42,159
Your friend called?

457
00:35:43,647 --> 00:35:45,842
He must be on a business trip.

458
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:51,438
I took a room in a motel.

459
00:35:53,127 --> 00:35:54,276
It's good.

460
00:35:55,207 --> 00:35:57,198
I want you to come with me.

461
00:36:03,007 --> 00:36:04,007
Sorry.

462
00:36:10,767 --> 00:36:11,836
SO?

463
00:36:17,327 --> 00:36:18,999
- Where you go?
- I go out.

464
00:36:19,807 --> 00:36:20,876
I can come?

465
00:36:22,007 --> 00:36:23,679
- Why not?
- Because.

466
00:36:24,087 --> 00:36:26,999
Sometimes adults have to
go out with other adults.

467
00:36:27,807 --> 00:36:28,807
Alone!

468
00:36:30,007 --> 00:36:31,201
Who is coming?

469
00:36:31,487 --> 00:36:32,681
Tori comes.

470
00:36:32,887 --> 00:36:34,240
I hate her!

471
00:36:34,407 --> 00:36:35,840
- Do not say that.
- She stink.

472
00:36:36,007 --> 00:36:37,122
It's wrong.

473
00:36:37,287 --> 00:36:38,640
She burps all the time.

474
00:36:38,807 --> 00:36:40,798
I will tell him not to.

475
00:36:56,927 --> 00:36:58,360
My sweet home.

476
00:37:05,367 --> 00:37:06,766
Sit down.

477
00:37:30,367 --> 00:37:31,846
I dont drink.

478
00:37:32,047 --> 00:37:33,047
What?

479
00:37:34,167 --> 00:37:35,361
I dont drink.

480
00:37:38,647 --> 00:37:39,966
You're right.

481
00:37:40,487 --> 00:37:41,966
No need for that.

482
00:37:43,447 --> 00:37:45,278
Call room service?

483
00:37:50,207 --> 00:37:52,163
I hadn't eaten it since
I was a kid.

484
00:37:52,327 --> 00:37:54,124
You're still a kid.

485
00:37:56,047 --> 00:37:57,560
Ben loves it.

486
00:37:57,727 --> 00:37:59,126
He loves sugar.

487
00:38:02,167 --> 00:38:03,885
Can I ask you something?

488
00:38:04,527 --> 00:38:05,596
Of course.

489
00:38:06,727 --> 00:38:08,365
What would you do...

490
00:38:08,767 --> 00:38:10,883
if you didn't have
to take care of your brother?

491
00:38:14,607 --> 00:38:16,438
- I dunno.
- Of course yes.

492
00:38:17,767 --> 00:38:18,961
Come on.

493
00:38:21,247 --> 00:38:22,646
I would go to college.

494
00:38:23,527 --> 00:38:24,527
Or?

495
00:38:25,047 --> 00:38:26,241
New York.

496
00:38:28,167 --> 00:38:29,680
J'adore New York.

497
00:38:30,487 --> 00:38:31,681
You and is there?

498
00:38:32,887 --> 00:38:35,162
I lived with an artist
in the "Village".

499
00:38:35,567 --> 00:38:38,127
He called his large paintings
"Horizontal Dreams".

500
00:38:38,287 --> 00:38:40,357
I will write a chapter on him.

501
00:38:40,967 --> 00:38:42,958
I lived there for about a year.

502
00:38:44,087 --> 00:38:46,157
You lived everywhere
for about a year.

503
00:38:48,167 --> 00:38:50,362
Are you trying to figure me out?

504
00:39:25,487 --> 00:39:27,000
You are shaking.

505
00:39:27,167 --> 00:39:28,167
I know.

506
00:39:28,567 --> 00:39:30,558
I can't help it.

507
00:39:32,647 --> 00:39:33,875
Relax.

508
00:39:52,647 --> 00:39:53,841
Everything's good.

509
00:39:57,367 --> 00:39:58,402
Sorry.

510
00:39:58,807 --> 00:40:00,798
It's new for me.

511
00:40:01,687 --> 00:40:02,881
It's OK.

512
00:40:06,247 --> 00:40:08,761
I won't do anything
you don't want to do.

513
00:40:45,167 --> 00:40:46,361
Shit!

514
00:40:49,927 --> 00:40:51,326
Where you go?

515
00:41:01,527 --> 00:41:03,199
You said 10 o'clock.

516
00:41:03,367 --> 00:41:04,516
Sorry.

517
00:41:04,687 --> 00:41:06,598
I had to see the guy from the party again.

518
00:41:06,767 --> 00:41:08,166
I fell asleep.

519
00:41:08,367 --> 00:41:09,880
Are you kidding me.

520
00:41:25,007 --> 00:41:26,360
Where were you?

521
00:41:26,967 --> 00:41:28,320
Go back to bed.

522
00:41:28,487 --> 00:41:30,284
- Where were you?
- Do not scream.

523
00:41:30,487 --> 00:41:31,522
I don't shout!

524
00:41:31,687 --> 00:41:34,565
I am an adult. You don't have
to know what I'm doing.

525
00:41:35,727 --> 00:41:37,080
I'm pose ca.

526
00:41:37,247 --> 00:41:38,965
I had another nightmare.

527
00:41:39,127 --> 00:41:40,127
Put it down!

528
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:42,044
The vampires were closing in!

529
00:41:42,847 --> 00:41:44,758
There are so many,
we can't hide.

530
00:41:44,927 --> 00:41:46,758
It's mythology, it's not real!

531
00:41:46,927 --> 00:41:47,962
It's real!

532
00:41:48,127 --> 00:41:49,845
You freak me out
with your vampires!

533
00:41:50,047 --> 00:41:51,526
You are always afraid!

534
00:41:52,527 --> 00:41:54,438
What did I say?

535
00:42:01,487 --> 00:42:03,000
Excuse me.

536
00:42:07,327 --> 00:42:08,726
Are you doing well?

537
00:42:13,727 --> 00:42:15,718
Go to bed.

538
00:42:25,327 --> 00:42:26,885
Here we are.

539
00:42:27,087 --> 00:42:28,486
The crime scene.

540
00:42:29,487 --> 00:42:30,317
Attends.

541
00:42:30,487 --> 00:42:32,000
Let me take the tour.

542
00:42:32,167 --> 00:42:33,600
Here is the living room.

543
00:42:33,767 --> 00:42:35,678
As you can see, it is spacious.

544
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:38,879
Note the high ceiling
and moldings.

545
00:42:39,767 --> 00:42:41,962
And of course,
the sublime brown sofa.

546
00:42:42,567 --> 00:42:44,285
Don't forget the trees.

547
00:42:45,087 --> 00:42:47,203
People love trees.

548
00:42:47,367 --> 00:42:50,165
It's like living in
a tree house.

549
00:42:52,767 --> 00:42:54,564
I'm going to make coffee.

550
00:43:06,327 --> 00:43:07,965
You smell so good.

551
00:43:10,967 --> 00:43:12,764
Let's visit the room.

552
00:43:14,367 --> 00:43:15,367
Attends.

553
00:43:17,087 --> 00:43:19,078
I really want to be with you.

554
00:43:19,807 --> 00:43:21,240
But I can not.

555
00:43:22,647 --> 00:43:23,647
Sorry,

556
00:43:24,047 --> 00:43:26,038
it is difficult to explain.

557
00:43:27,847 --> 00:43:28,847
Try.

558
00:43:30,167 --> 00:43:31,167
Evelyn,

559
00:43:32,647 --> 00:43:35,207
I messed up so many things
in my life.

560
00:43:36,807 --> 00:43:38,684
Sorry, it must seem...

561
00:43:40,287 --> 00:43:41,287
It's OK.

562
00:43:42,927 --> 00:43:44,519
I appreciate you a lot.

563
00:43:44,847 --> 00:43:45,847
More...

564
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:47,446
There is no "but...

565
00:43:49,327 --> 00:43:51,636
I can't be with you

566
00:43:52,247 --> 00:43:54,442
before you think I deserve you.

567
00:43:59,567 --> 00:44:01,478
We will take the time you need.

568
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:14,838
We should have taken a taxi.

569
00:44:15,007 --> 00:44:16,406
Everything is my fault.

570
00:44:21,687 --> 00:44:22,756
<i>Hello PJ.</i>

571
00:44:23,967 --> 00:44:25,764
<i>I was hoping to bump into you.</i>

572
00:44:26,367 --> 00:44:27,959
<i>I know it's been a long time.</i>

573
00:44:28,567 --> 00:44:30,956
<i>I wanted you to know
that I'm back.</i>

574
00:44:31,567 --> 00:44:33,080
<i>Maybe we could meet again?</i>

575
00:44:33,687 --> 00:44:36,679
<i>I don't really have a place
to go right now.</i>

576
00:44:37,487 --> 00:44:39,478
<i>I'm sorry for the last time.</i>

577
00:44:55,327 --> 00:44:56,760
<i>Hi it's me.</i>

578
00:44:57,167 --> 00:44:58,167
<i>PJ!</i>

579
00:44:58,447 --> 00:45:00,085
<i>It's been a long time.</i>

580
00:45:00,247 --> 00:45:01,441
Is this a reproach?

581
00:45:04,287 --> 00:45:05,720
- How are you?
- GOOD.

582
00:45:05,927 --> 00:45:08,122
I hear you're looking for Jordan.

583
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:11,642
Exact.

584
00:45:12,287 --> 00:45:14,039
That bastard called me.

585
00:45:15,327 --> 00:45:16,646
<i>He's in town.</i>

586
00:45:26,727 --> 00:45:28,126
What are you doing?

587
00:45:28,647 --> 00:45:29,841
A Pont Levis.

588
00:45:31,767 --> 00:45:33,280
It looks good.

589
00:45:34,647 --> 00:45:36,319
I brought you something.

590
00:45:38,447 --> 00:45:39,516
Cool!

591
00:45:40,807 --> 00:45:42,126
You like?

592
00:45:43,127 --> 00:45:45,118
- And guard!
- Attention, mon grand.

593
00:45:46,447 --> 00:45:47,766
I go!

594
00:45:53,887 --> 00:45:55,240
Hello, Ben.

595
00:45:57,967 --> 00:45:59,559
Ben go to your room.

596
00:46:01,367 --> 00:46:02,367
NOW!

597
00:46:04,967 --> 00:46:07,242
I was passing, I saw your car.

598
00:46:07,847 --> 00:46:09,360
I believed Ben at school.

599
00:46:09,527 --> 00:46:11,483
It's a "school at home" day.

600
00:46:11,647 --> 00:46:12,921
It still exists?

601
00:46:13,327 --> 00:46:16,319
I took you to the sea
on a day like this.

602
00:46:16,927 --> 00:46:19,566
You picked up something purple
and tangy

603
00:46:19,727 --> 00:46:21,524
and you started crying.

604
00:46:22,327 --> 00:46:23,919
I do not remember.

605
00:46:25,847 --> 00:46:28,919
I hope I can take Ben there.

606
00:46:29,767 --> 00:46:31,359
It's not a good idea.

607
00:46:33,367 --> 00:46:36,359
We may need
some help discussing this.

608
00:46:37,167 --> 00:46:38,759
Let's get together.

609
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:40,156
Alright.

610
00:46:40,487 --> 00:46:42,478
I want Louise there.

611
00:46:53,327 --> 00:46:56,842
My client just wants to see Ben
every week.

612
00:46:57,727 --> 00:46:59,365
Doug left for 6 years.

613
00:46:59,527 --> 00:47:02,121
All of a sudden
he wants to play sugar daddy?

614
00:47:02,647 --> 00:47:05,161
I remind you
that Doug is Ben's father,

615
00:47:05,327 --> 00:47:07,318
and has parental rights over Ben.

616
00:47:07,727 --> 00:47:09,479
I remember you

617
00:47:09,647 --> 00:47:12,445
that your client does not have the
best parental background.

618
00:47:12,687 --> 00:47:14,962
Doug works
for a construction company.

619
00:47:15,127 --> 00:47:17,436
And can contribute
to Ben's well-being.

620
00:47:18,247 --> 00:47:19,839
He was an alcoholic.

621
00:47:20,047 --> 00:47:21,844
He's been sober for two years.

622
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:24,322
His friends and colleagues
can attest to that.

623
00:47:24,847 --> 00:47:26,724
He abandoned his family.

624
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:28,280
He preferred to leave.

625
00:47:28,447 --> 00:47:30,563
He didn't want to harm his family
because of alcohol.

626
00:47:30,727 --> 00:47:32,718
He had a problem.
He overcame it.

627
00:47:33,167 --> 00:47:35,158
A judge won't think that.

628
00:47:36,167 --> 00:47:39,364
A judge will think your client
is only 19

629
00:47:39,567 --> 00:47:41,762
and earns his living as a waiter.

630
00:47:42,447 --> 00:47:45,405
Charlie saves money for
Ben's education,

631
00:47:45,567 --> 00:47:46,841
each month.

632
00:47:47,047 --> 00:47:49,047
Because of the circumstances,
the law is very clear

633
00:47:49,167 --> 00:47:51,362
concerning the precedence
of the rights of the father.

634
00:47:52,407 --> 00:47:54,318
You wouldn't want
to go to the judge.

635
00:47:54,487 --> 00:47:55,886
Its a threat?

636
00:47:57,887 --> 00:48:00,082
I don't want it to happen
like this.

637
00:48:01,007 --> 00:48:03,601
All I ask
is to see Ben every week.

638
00:48:13,487 --> 00:48:15,045
It's the manager!

639
00:48:21,807 --> 00:48:23,240
I can help you?

640
00:48:23,727 --> 00:48:25,718
- It does not work.
- What?

641
00:48:26,327 --> 00:48:28,238
You heard, it doesn't work.

642
00:48:28,887 --> 00:48:30,366
What bad luck!

643
00:48:42,167 --> 00:48:43,520
I lost my card.

644
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:46,485
Someone must have used it
because the account is dry.

645
00:48:46,967 --> 00:48:48,161
It sucks.

646
00:48:50,287 --> 00:48:53,279
And I can't use it anymore
until it's fixed.

647
00:48:57,287 --> 00:48:58,720
Can i stay here?

648
00:49:00,207 --> 00:49:01,435
I dunno.

649
00:49:01,607 --> 00:49:02,756
Why not?

650
00:49:02,927 --> 00:49:05,202
It's complicated right now.

651
00:49:05,607 --> 00:49:06,722
For example?

652
00:49:06,887 --> 00:49:08,161
My father came back.

653
00:49:08,447 --> 00:49:09,641
He lives here?

654
00:49:11,847 --> 00:49:13,041
So it doesn't matter.

655
00:49:13,207 --> 00:49:14,207
Come on.

656
00:49:14,327 --> 00:49:15,601
I don't want to beg.

657
00:49:17,727 --> 00:49:19,046
I don't want to beg.

658
00:49:20,807 --> 00:49:22,843
But, you sleep on the couch.

659
00:49:23,367 --> 00:49:24,800
I don't want to upset Ben.

660
00:49:24,967 --> 00:49:26,958
- Awarded.
- And more grass.

661
00:49:31,287 --> 00:49:33,437
I'll put my things in your room.

662
00:49:34,447 --> 00:49:35,641
I'm joking.

663
00:49:46,967 --> 00:49:48,719
Isn't that high enough?

664
00:49:49,047 --> 00:49:50,047
Almost.

665
00:49:51,647 --> 00:49:53,160
Do you have an old rag?

666
00:49:55,127 --> 00:49:56,321
For what?

667
00:49:56,527 --> 00:49:58,006
A small accident.

668
00:50:07,247 --> 00:50:08,726
Cool, the castle.

669
00:50:09,327 --> 00:50:10,726
It's a strong.

670
00:50:12,207 --> 00:50:13,322
Alright.

671
00:50:14,607 --> 00:50:15,722
And that?

672
00:50:16,167 --> 00:50:17,646
The drawbridge.

673
00:50:18,087 --> 00:50:19,122
Cool.

674
00:50:19,967 --> 00:50:21,241
And in there?

675
00:50:21,407 --> 00:50:23,716
This is the dungeon where
the dog-men live.

676
00:50:24,007 --> 00:50:25,122
The dog-men...

677
00:50:25,607 --> 00:50:27,120
It's very cool.

678
00:50:28,327 --> 00:50:29,327
And that?

679
00:50:29,727 --> 00:50:31,843
These are the moats.
They go around.

680
00:50:32,447 --> 00:50:33,447
Cool.

681
00:50:33,967 --> 00:50:35,480
Stop saying "cool".

682
00:50:46,727 --> 00:50:48,126
He is sleeping?

683
00:50:50,887 --> 00:50:52,400
He doesn't love me.

684
00:50:53,327 --> 00:50:54,601
He likes you.

685
00:50:54,767 --> 00:50:55,802
He hates me.

686
00:50:55,967 --> 00:50:57,559
- But no.
- But if.

687
00:50:58,727 --> 00:51:00,240
He's just possessive.

688
00:51:00,447 --> 00:51:01,960
Well, he hates me.

689
00:51:24,767 --> 00:51:25,961
Charlie?

690
00:51:50,927 --> 00:51:52,121
You want some?

691
00:51:56,727 --> 00:51:58,445
Let's play knights.

692
00:51:59,047 --> 00:52:00,275
It's silly.

693
00:52:00,447 --> 00:52:01,562
No, it's funny.

694
00:52:01,727 --> 00:52:04,241
You can be Lancelot
and I will be King Arthur.

695
00:52:05,727 --> 00:52:07,319
Alright, let's go play.

696
00:52:16,367 --> 00:52:18,358
"Eggs Etcetera", hello.

697
00:52:21,167 --> 00:52:22,839
Charlie, this is for you.

698
00:52:23,047 --> 00:52:24,844
Le Proviseur de Ben.

699
00:52:31,727 --> 00:52:34,764
At first they fought
with imaginary swords.

700
00:52:34,967 --> 00:52:37,879
Then Ben started hitting
Andy for real.

701
00:52:38,847 --> 00:52:40,246
Andy is okay?

702
00:52:40,567 --> 00:52:41,966
He has a broken nose.

703
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,482
My God!

704
00:52:43,967 --> 00:52:46,481
Ben n'a jamais fait
ce genre de choses.

705
00:52:47,087 --> 00:52:49,078
He went through a lot of hardships.

706
00:52:49,687 --> 00:52:52,679
When a child loses a parent,
he often reacts

707
00:52:52,967 --> 00:52:54,161
violently.

708
00:52:54,687 --> 00:52:56,484
Did he consult afterwards?

709
00:52:57,487 --> 00:52:59,796
She said he was doing fine.

710
00:52:59,967 --> 00:53:01,286
Nevertheless.

711
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:04,355
Does Ben behave differently
at home?

712
00:53:06,207 --> 00:53:07,640
He's a bit moody.

713
00:53:08,767 --> 00:53:11,486
His teacher says he is worried.

714
00:53:13,887 --> 00:53:15,605
I know you are doing your best.

715
00:53:16,127 --> 00:53:18,561
Watch for things that could
cause her stress or

716
00:53:18,727 --> 00:53:20,206
any lack of stability.

717
00:53:43,407 --> 00:53:45,125
What shirt do you want
to wear tomorrow?

718
00:53:45,767 --> 00:53:47,246
Je m'en chip.

719
00:53:50,007 --> 00:53:51,486
I hate this jersey.

720
00:53:52,087 --> 00:53:53,361
You adored him.

721
00:53:53,687 --> 00:53:55,279
Now I hate him.

722
00:54:02,207 --> 00:54:03,879
Why do I have to go there?

723
00:54:04,047 --> 00:54:06,163
Because your daddy wants to see you.

724
00:54:06,447 --> 00:54:07,447
For what?

725
00:54:07,847 --> 00:54:09,041
He misses you.

726
00:54:10,087 --> 00:54:11,679
Why don't you go?

727
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:13,286
I am older.

728
00:54:14,927 --> 00:54:16,519
This is not the same.

729
00:54:16,847 --> 00:54:18,519
What if I have a nightmare?

730
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:21,444
I almost forgot.

731
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:36,486
You will be safe.

732
00:55:06,527 --> 00:55:08,404
Hello, come in.

733
00:55:17,487 --> 00:55:19,000
I really like trees.

734
00:55:24,447 --> 00:55:26,278
Ben's room is over there.

735
00:55:26,487 --> 00:55:27,681
Go and see her.

736
00:55:34,887 --> 00:55:36,525
I really appreciate it, Charlie.

737
00:55:36,727 --> 00:55:38,604
He must be in bed before 10 p.m.

738
00:55:38,847 --> 00:55:39,916
Its very important.

739
00:55:40,247 --> 00:55:41,726
No sugar after 8 p.m.

740
00:55:42,927 --> 00:55:45,287
And he has cavities. He has to brush
his teeth after dinner.

741
00:55:46,607 --> 00:55:49,121
You brushed your teeth
all the time.

742
00:55:49,407 --> 00:55:51,716
After every meal, as one should.

743
00:55:52,527 --> 00:55:55,280
The dentist said he
never saw a mouth

744
00:55:55,447 --> 00:55:57,438
as clean in a 10-year-old child.

745
00:55:57,767 --> 00:56:01,555
You were so proud because
you had to choose an award.

746
00:56:02,767 --> 00:56:05,600
I watched you as
you detailed each toy

747
00:56:05,767 --> 00:56:06,767
to choose the best.

748
00:56:07,567 --> 00:56:11,037
Should you take the car
or the parachute?

749
00:56:11,687 --> 00:56:14,076
- Or that sticky thing...
- Stop it!

750
00:56:15,687 --> 00:56:17,678
- What?
- Stop these stories.

751
00:56:18,087 --> 00:56:18,917
For what?

752
00:56:19,087 --> 00:56:20,759
You try to make everything right.

753
00:56:21,887 --> 00:56:24,959
Your stories don't match
my memories.

754
00:56:29,207 --> 00:56:30,925
Charlie, I'm sorry.

755
00:56:31,527 --> 00:56:34,997
I'm sorry for everything
I've done wrong in the past.

756
00:56:36,127 --> 00:56:38,163
For every time I hurt you.

757
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:41,965
I wish I could start over
and improve everything.

758
00:56:44,687 --> 00:56:46,518
But you can't.

759
00:56:56,527 --> 00:56:57,801
See you tomorrow.

760
00:57:14,167 --> 00:57:15,646
Do you like smoked beef?

761
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:16,876
I dunno.

762
00:57:17,487 --> 00:57:20,479
It's the best
beef sandwich you'll find.

763
00:57:21,007 --> 00:57:23,282
It's a specialty of the Conrads.

764
00:57:23,887 --> 00:57:25,081
Look at this.

765
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:30,440
Bon, hey?

766
00:57:33,327 --> 00:57:34,601
Where is yours?

767
00:57:34,807 --> 00:57:36,604
I can't eat
until tomorrow night.

768
00:57:37,207 --> 00:57:38,207
For what?

769
00:57:38,407 --> 00:57:39,999
Because it's Yom Kippur.

770
00:57:40,967 --> 00:57:42,036
Is it Jewish?

771
00:57:43,127 --> 00:57:44,879
It's a special day.

772
00:57:45,047 --> 00:57:47,925
You tell God that you are sorry
for your wrongdoings.

773
00:57:49,287 --> 00:57:51,881
- Aren't you hungry?
- I'm starving.

774
00:57:54,047 --> 00:57:55,605
Why don't you eat?

775
00:57:57,047 --> 00:58:00,119
That's how God knows I'm sorry.

776
00:58:04,967 --> 00:58:07,356
Charlie told me
you liked loud ones.

777
00:58:08,687 --> 00:58:11,281
Could we make
something together?

778
00:58:13,247 --> 00:58:14,247
What?

779
00:58:14,287 --> 00:58:15,686
What would you like?

780
00:58:16,487 --> 00:58:17,681
A shield.

781
00:58:18,287 --> 00:58:19,686
A shield, okay.

782
00:58:20,087 --> 00:58:22,476
Next time we'll make a shield.

783
00:58:28,887 --> 00:58:30,843
There's a room for Ben.

784
00:58:31,047 --> 00:58:32,082
So what?

785
00:58:32,247 --> 00:58:34,363
So this is Ben's room!

786
00:58:35,367 --> 00:58:36,880
He constantly talks about the past,

787
00:58:37,047 --> 00:58:39,845
but only memories
sanitized at the beach.

788
00:58:41,007 --> 00:58:43,157
He's not gonna talk about
the bad times.

789
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:47,682
The three years before he left,
I never saw him sober.

790
00:58:51,567 --> 00:58:54,001
I promised myself
never to be like him.

791
00:58:54,807 --> 00:58:56,399
You said he was different.

792
00:58:56,807 --> 00:58:58,399
What if he's pretending?

793
00:59:02,167 --> 00:59:04,123
Once, when I was 10.

794
00:59:05,167 --> 00:59:08,000
It was summer and I was running
around the house shirtless.

795
00:59:09,807 --> 00:59:11,604
He came home early from work.

796
00:59:12,407 --> 00:59:14,477
Must be the day he was fired.

797
00:59:15,447 --> 00:59:17,244
He was completely drunk

798
00:59:17,967 --> 00:59:19,241
and continued to drink.

799
00:59:22,087 --> 00:59:24,806
As I ran, I knocked over his drink.

800
00:59:27,847 --> 00:59:29,439
He was smoking a cigarette.

801
00:59:31,047 --> 00:59:32,639
He caught me

802
00:59:33,527 --> 00:59:34,926
he took his cigarette

803
00:59:36,807 --> 00:59:38,877
and burned my chest.

804
00:59:40,967 --> 00:59:42,116
Good God.

805
00:59:44,407 --> 00:59:45,840
Do you have a scar?

806
00:59:50,847 --> 00:59:52,075
I can see?

807
00:59:56,647 --> 00:59:58,046
Let me see.

808
01:00:32,967 --> 01:00:34,764
I wrote something for you.

809
01:00:37,647 --> 01:00:39,239
"Ocean waves,

810
01:00:41,127 --> 01:00:42,765
"a drop came to me

811
01:00:44,687 --> 01:00:46,518
"whispering I love you.

812
01:00:49,047 --> 01:00:51,561
"I've traveled a lot just
to see you,

813
01:00:53,807 --> 01:00:55,206
"to touch you.

814
01:00:58,087 --> 01:01:00,521
"Because I can't die
without seeing you.

815
01:01:03,607 --> 01:01:05,723
"Because I'm afraid of losing you".

816
01:01:08,007 --> 01:01:10,726
It's "Because I would have been
afraid of losing you".

817
01:01:12,447 --> 01:01:14,119
C'est de Walt Whitman.

818
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:11,915
Residence Conrad.

819
01:02:12,647 --> 01:02:13,762
Charlie is there?

820
01:02:14,167 --> 01:02:15,964
Tori just picked it up.

821
01:02:16,847 --> 01:02:17,962
<i>C'est Ben?</i>

822
01:02:19,967 --> 01:02:21,559
What is it man?

823
01:02:26,567 --> 01:02:28,558
Your chariot is there, Master Benjamin.

824
01:02:54,327 --> 01:02:55,919
- I can help you?
- Is Charlie here?

825
01:02:56,847 --> 01:02:58,041
Well is there?

826
01:02:59,087 --> 01:03:00,406
You must be Doug.

827
01:03:00,567 --> 01:03:01,397
Your cherche Ben.

828
01:03:01,567 --> 01:03:02,716
He's there.

829
01:03:02,887 --> 01:03:04,684
Thank God. He is fine?

830
01:03:05,567 --> 01:03:06,682
I can?

831
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:09,358
- He doesn't want to see you.
- Who are you?

832
01:03:10,007 --> 01:03:11,679
I'm Jordan, I live here.

833
01:03:12,007 --> 01:03:14,077
I'm sorry,
I had gone to the temple.

834
01:03:14,287 --> 01:03:16,367
I thought he would
still be sleeping when I got back.

835
01:03:16,607 --> 01:03:18,006
Charlie told me about you.

836
01:03:18,807 --> 01:03:21,241
Children don't like
to wake up and be alone.

837
01:03:21,407 --> 01:03:23,716
- That's why...
- It upsets the children.

838
01:03:23,887 --> 01:03:25,400
I just want...

839
01:03:25,607 --> 01:03:26,926
- Calm down.
- Go away!

840
01:03:27,087 --> 01:03:28,486
I do not want to fight...

841
01:03:50,967 --> 01:03:52,161
You should have seen it.

842
01:03:52,327 --> 01:03:53,840
He no longer knew where he was.

843
01:03:54,127 --> 01:03:55,640
Did you hit him?

844
01:03:56,647 --> 01:03:58,638
- For what?
- He forced entry.

845
01:03:59,127 --> 01:04:00,446
How did he react?

846
01:04:00,647 --> 01:04:01,921
He left.

847
01:04:04,487 --> 01:04:06,364
- You should be happy.
- For what?

848
01:04:06,527 --> 01:04:07,755
He's an asshole.

849
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:09,280
- Good god, Jordan.
- What?

850
01:04:09,447 --> 01:04:11,358
He's going to use that
against me.

851
01:04:11,527 --> 01:04:12,277
And?

852
01:04:12,447 --> 01:04:14,836
I must be a good tutor for Ben,

853
01:04:15,327 --> 01:04:17,522
provide him with a safe environment.

854
01:04:19,727 --> 01:04:21,558
Didn't you say you lived here?

855
01:04:23,767 --> 01:04:25,166
- Good God!
- What?

856
01:04:25,327 --> 01:04:26,726
You are really stupid.

857
01:04:27,207 --> 01:04:28,401
Do not insult me.

858
01:04:28,727 --> 01:04:30,206
Stop being stupid.

859
01:04:30,527 --> 01:04:32,119
What's your problem?

860
01:04:32,407 --> 01:04:35,558
It's you who do what you want,
according to your desires,

861
01:04:35,727 --> 01:04:38,525
without worrying about the consequences,
as long as you have fun!

862
01:04:38,727 --> 01:04:42,436
And you, you want to control everything
otherwise you freak out!

863
01:04:42,647 --> 01:04:44,478
Some have responsibilities.

864
01:04:44,647 --> 01:04:47,320
Some are too afraid
to be themselves.

865
01:04:47,647 --> 01:04:50,719
You're so afraid of becoming
your father that you don't live!

866
01:04:52,927 --> 01:04:54,201
Out!

867
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:56,807
Out!

868
01:05:39,687 --> 01:05:41,279
Did you clean it?

869
01:05:44,087 --> 01:05:45,566
He didn't miss you.

870
01:05:48,607 --> 01:05:50,120
And you didn't reply?

871
01:06:11,847 --> 01:06:13,246
Are we going to the park?

872
01:06:14,327 --> 01:06:15,646
Not now.

873
01:06:15,847 --> 01:06:16,882
Why not?

874
01:06:17,047 --> 01:06:18,321
- I'm tired.
- For what?

875
01:06:18,527 --> 01:06:20,324
- I did not sleep.
- For what?

876
01:06:21,247 --> 01:06:22,919
No reason, leave me alone.

877
01:06:23,647 --> 01:06:24,841
Where is Jordan?

878
01:06:26,287 --> 01:06:27,402
He's not there.

879
01:06:27,567 --> 01:06:29,239
I heard you arguing.

880
01:06:29,447 --> 01:06:30,846
Why this?

881
01:06:31,927 --> 01:06:33,623
- I don't want to talk about it.
- For what?

882
01:06:33,647 --> 01:06:34,875
- I do not want.
- For what?

883
01:06:35,047 --> 01:06:36,047
Because.

884
01:06:36,167 --> 01:06:37,680
Why did you hit Eddie?

885
01:06:37,847 --> 01:06:39,041
I hate him.

886
01:06:39,567 --> 01:06:40,966
It's your friend.

887
01:06:41,367 --> 01:06:42,959
- I hate Eddie.
- Stop saying that.

888
01:06:43,367 --> 01:06:44,686
- I hate Andy.
- Stopped!

889
01:06:45,087 --> 01:06:47,078
I hate Eddie, I hate Jordan
and I hate you!

890
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:49,281
I hate you!

891
01:06:58,407 --> 01:06:59,601
Ben called me.

892
01:07:00,007 --> 01:07:02,202
I know. I authorized it.

893
01:07:02,607 --> 01:07:04,723
Did you tell him he could
come and sleep?

894
01:07:05,807 --> 01:07:08,002
He keeps talking about a shield.

895
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:10,519
We're going to make one.

896
01:07:12,407 --> 01:07:14,477
Ben told me you
were teaching him to be Jewish.

897
01:07:15,607 --> 01:07:17,325
I told him about Yom Kippur.

898
01:07:18,967 --> 01:07:20,366
Which one is it?

899
01:07:20,567 --> 01:07:22,046
The Day of Atonement.

900
01:07:23,047 --> 01:07:26,244
There are all these books in which
God writes the names of all.

901
01:07:26,767 --> 01:07:28,564
On Yom Kippur, these judgments

902
01:07:29,167 --> 01:07:31,362
recorded in the books are sealed.

903
01:07:33,767 --> 01:07:35,200
It's like history.

904
01:07:37,687 --> 01:07:39,723
You should come to the temple
one of these days.

905
01:07:43,887 --> 01:07:45,525
- I'm ready.
- And your bag?

906
01:07:47,047 --> 01:07:48,446
He smells bad.

907
01:07:48,727 --> 01:07:50,319
I want to speak with Charlie.

908
01:07:50,927 --> 01:07:52,326
Can I wait in the car?

909
01:07:52,647 --> 01:07:54,046
It is open.

910
01:07:57,767 --> 01:08:00,361
I wanted to apologize for
what happened yesterday.

911
01:08:01,047 --> 01:08:02,526
It wasn't you who hit me.

912
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:03,687
Nevertheless.

913
01:08:04,087 --> 01:08:05,087
This guy,

914
01:08:05,687 --> 01:08:07,166
he said he lived here.

915
01:08:08,487 --> 01:08:09,556
It is a friend.

916
01:08:09,887 --> 01:08:11,161
Do you know him well?

917
01:08:13,727 --> 01:08:15,718
It's not a good idea
for him to live here,

918
01:08:15,887 --> 01:08:17,036
especially for Ben.

919
01:08:17,207 --> 01:08:19,482
You don't have to tell me
how to take care of Ben.

920
01:08:20,407 --> 01:08:22,841
You can't criticize
after what you've done!

921
01:08:23,007 --> 01:08:24,042
I am your father!

922
01:08:24,207 --> 01:08:25,606
When you feel like it.

923
01:08:25,887 --> 01:08:27,400
Why did you come back?

924
01:08:52,007 --> 01:08:53,520
How did you get back?

925
01:08:53,807 --> 01:08:55,126
It was open.

926
01:08:58,567 --> 01:09:00,159
I can have water?

927
01:09:29,847 --> 01:09:31,326
Where were you?

928
01:09:32,407 --> 01:09:33,476
Are you interested?

929
01:09:33,647 --> 01:09:35,000
You're right, I don't care.

930
01:09:35,167 --> 01:09:36,805
- You fired me.
- You were a real jerk.

931
01:09:36,967 --> 01:09:37,967
You also.

932
01:09:40,487 --> 01:09:41,681
T'as bu?

933
01:09:45,327 --> 01:09:46,555
- Great.
- What?

934
01:09:46,727 --> 01:09:48,126
Nothing, everything is fine.

935
01:09:48,327 --> 01:09:49,601
Go, little ones.

936
01:09:50,127 --> 01:09:51,242
Do what you want.

937
01:09:51,407 --> 01:09:52,920
- Where you go?
- Let go of me.

938
01:09:53,807 --> 01:09:55,001
Leave me!

939
01:09:55,207 --> 01:09:56,407
- I'm sorry.
- Do not touch me.

940
01:09:56,527 --> 01:09:57,721
I am...

941
01:09:58,127 --> 01:09:59,127
Sorry.

942
01:10:04,527 --> 01:10:05,596
Let go of me!

943
01:10:05,767 --> 01:10:06,961
So sorry.

944
01:10:50,727 --> 01:10:52,046
How are you,

945
01:10:52,247 --> 01:10:53,566
bump?

946
01:11:14,407 --> 01:11:15,840
What do you think?

947
01:11:16,127 --> 01:11:17,242
Not bad.

948
01:11:17,647 --> 01:11:18,966
When do we paint it?

949
01:11:19,567 --> 01:11:20,841
We will do it.

950
01:11:28,207 --> 01:11:29,686
I saw this at the store,

951
01:11:30,087 --> 01:11:31,566
you should love.

952
01:11:33,287 --> 01:11:36,279
Don't worry if it's too much,
you'll finish it later.

953
01:11:38,367 --> 01:11:39,959
Want some?

954
01:11:41,087 --> 01:11:42,281
No, it's fine.

955
01:11:43,647 --> 01:11:45,444
Is it still Yom Kippur?

956
01:11:49,007 --> 01:11:50,281
You don't like that?

957
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:51,846
Yes, I like that.

958
01:11:53,367 --> 01:11:54,959
You deserve it more than me.

959
01:11:55,727 --> 01:11:57,126
You deserve it.

960
01:12:32,207 --> 01:12:33,207
Vince.

961
01:12:33,247 --> 01:12:34,726
It's been a long time.

962
01:12:35,127 --> 01:12:36,321
Where were you?

963
01:12:37,247 --> 01:12:38,441
Here and there.

964
01:12:38,647 --> 01:12:39,921
That's to say?

965
01:12:41,007 --> 01:12:42,440
I was in Culiacan.

966
01:12:42,767 --> 01:12:45,235
Without dec. I was in Culiacan,

967
01:12:46,087 --> 01:12:47,566
two months ago.

968
01:12:48,167 --> 01:12:49,282
And or?

969
01:12:50,927 --> 01:12:51,962
Wood.

970
01:12:52,527 --> 01:12:55,041
What a coincidence,
I went to Madera too.

971
01:12:56,687 --> 01:12:59,201
Let me guess...
Next was Tijuana.

972
01:12:59,887 --> 01:13:01,002
I am right?

973
01:13:01,847 --> 01:13:03,519
I have to go check my car...

974
01:13:06,407 --> 01:13:08,045
We frequent the same places,

975
01:13:08,207 --> 01:13:10,721
it was inevitable
that we would meet again.

976
01:13:17,127 --> 01:13:18,606
What happened to you?

977
01:13:21,527 --> 01:13:22,676
Who did this to you?

978
01:13:22,847 --> 01:13:24,599
- It's an ugly thing.
- What?

979
01:13:25,007 --> 01:13:26,201
I'm too dumb.

980
01:13:27,007 --> 01:13:28,838
- You are shaking.
- I'm too dumb!

981
01:13:29,007 --> 01:13:30,884
Calm down.
Tell me what is happening.

982
01:13:31,207 --> 01:13:32,799
I stole a car.

983
01:13:33,287 --> 01:13:34,287
A Mexico.

984
01:13:35,007 --> 01:13:36,804
You told me your car was stolen.

985
01:13:37,007 --> 01:13:38,486
I stole the car.

986
01:13:40,207 --> 01:13:42,198
That was four months ago
and everything was fine.

987
01:13:43,087 --> 01:13:45,681
And I saw this guy Vince again.

988
01:13:47,287 --> 01:13:50,199
He cheated me and
I lost all my money.

989
01:13:51,807 --> 01:13:53,081
I was enraged.

990
01:13:53,247 --> 01:13:55,283
I took his car and left.

991
01:13:55,447 --> 01:13:57,244
- Where is the car?
- I sold it.

992
01:13:58,247 --> 01:13:59,965
I needed money!

993
01:14:00,647 --> 01:14:03,115
So this guy Vince did this to you?

994
01:14:04,327 --> 01:14:05,601
He has a gun.

995
01:14:06,087 --> 01:14:07,679
- I call the police!
- You can not.

996
01:14:08,407 --> 01:14:10,284
I'll have to explain
the car theft.

997
01:14:10,487 --> 01:14:11,681
It won't end!

998
01:14:14,607 --> 01:14:16,040
Where is he now?

999
01:14:21,847 --> 01:14:23,121
Did you bring him here?

1000
01:14:23,287 --> 01:14:24,927
He wouldn't let me go,
he wants his money!

1001
01:14:25,207 --> 01:14:26,401
Where is he?

1002
01:14:26,807 --> 01:14:27,807
Spent.

1003
01:14:28,007 --> 01:14:29,406
Why did you bring it back?

1004
01:14:29,607 --> 01:14:31,006
I thought...

1005
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:33,399
You have money aside

1006
01:14:34,087 --> 01:14:36,078
I can borrow some from you

1007
01:14:36,607 --> 01:14:38,006
something to calm him down.

1008
01:14:38,327 --> 01:14:39,806
You want some money?

1009
01:14:40,207 --> 01:14:41,606
You're saving up for Ben.

1010
01:14:42,007 --> 01:14:43,235
You too cash on delivery.

1011
01:14:43,407 --> 01:14:45,125
You want me to give you
Ben's money.

1012
01:14:48,167 --> 01:14:50,158
You take me for an idiot.

1013
01:14:50,367 --> 01:14:51,846
You engineered it all.

1014
01:14:52,567 --> 01:14:54,487
You have nowhere to go,
your car has been stolen.

1015
01:14:54,767 --> 01:14:55,995
It's not that!

1016
01:14:56,167 --> 01:14:57,236
It's what?

1017
01:14:58,647 --> 01:15:00,160
He is going to kill me.

1018
01:15:07,527 --> 01:15:09,757
There's 5,000 in Ben's account.

1019
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:13,679
- It's not enough.
- It is all I have!

1020
01:15:19,807 --> 01:15:21,001
- Give the phone.
- For what?

1021
01:15:21,167 --> 01:15:22,566
Give the phone!

1022
01:15:34,287 --> 01:15:35,959
Doug, it's me Charlie.

1023
01:15:38,167 --> 01:15:40,965
And there is a passage for
each of the rooms in the fort.

1024
01:15:41,567 --> 01:15:42,841
It's very elaborate.

1025
01:15:43,047 --> 01:15:44,639
I have to go out for a while.

1026
01:15:45,247 --> 01:15:47,238
Evelyn will take care of you.

1027
01:15:48,167 --> 01:15:49,361
I come back soon.

1028
01:16:10,487 --> 01:16:12,000
Why are we here?

1029
01:16:12,167 --> 01:16:13,486
For the distributor.

1030
01:16:13,647 --> 01:16:15,478
- A distributor?
- It's 5 p.m.

1031
01:16:15,647 --> 01:16:18,241
The banks are closed.
It's a beginning.

1032
01:16:19,847 --> 01:16:21,724
Give me that fucking card.

1033
01:16:34,567 --> 01:16:36,080
It better work.

1034
01:16:47,687 --> 01:16:50,599
You are arrested for withdrawing
stolen money!

1035
01:16:50,967 --> 01:16:53,083
- It's not my card.
- Tell that to the judge.

1036
01:17:01,367 --> 01:17:02,925
Go outside. Go over there.

1037
01:17:04,727 --> 01:17:05,762
You also.

1038
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:10,805
Sat! You also!

1039
01:17:14,047 --> 01:17:15,321
Is your name Jordan?

1040
01:17:16,847 --> 01:17:18,678
You have a hell of a reputation.

1041
01:17:20,527 --> 01:17:23,997
Your buddy is wanted in
two states for identity theft.

1042
01:17:24,287 --> 01:17:27,085
He has been monitored by my department
for a month.

1043
01:17:28,407 --> 01:17:30,363
And now we have it.

1044
01:17:31,167 --> 01:17:32,680
How old are you, Jordan?

1045
01:17:32,847 --> 01:17:33,847
22 years old.

1046
01:17:34,967 --> 01:17:37,800
You think you have all the time
ahead of you.

1047
01:17:38,087 --> 01:17:41,204
You think you can still
do this for a few more years.

1048
01:17:41,407 --> 01:17:44,399
Lying, stealing...
And then I'll stop.

1049
01:17:46,007 --> 01:17:48,157
20 years will have passed, so quickly.

1050
01:17:48,327 --> 01:17:50,363
20 will have passed before
you know it.

1051
01:17:50,527 --> 01:17:52,324
You will have screwed up your life.

1052
01:17:54,087 --> 01:17:57,124
I'm tired of seeing people
like you waste their lives.

1053
01:17:58,247 --> 01:17:59,396
What's your name?

1054
01:17:59,567 --> 01:18:00,636
Vincent.

1055
01:18:01,567 --> 01:18:03,159
You're not from here, huh?

1056
01:18:04,207 --> 01:18:05,207
Upright.

1057
01:18:07,727 --> 01:18:09,001
What is...?

1058
01:18:09,807 --> 01:18:11,206
You're lucky.

1059
01:18:13,407 --> 01:18:15,204
We're not after you.

1060
01:18:17,007 --> 01:18:19,441
I don't want to see you here again.

1061
01:18:19,847 --> 01:18:21,075
Get out of here!

1062
01:18:21,247 --> 01:18:22,965
- What about my gun?
- Go away!

1063
01:18:32,607 --> 01:18:33,676
Not bad.

1064
01:18:34,767 --> 01:18:35,767
Not bad.

1065
01:18:42,407 --> 01:18:44,284
Are you going to take them away from me?

1066
01:19:02,127 --> 01:19:04,436
A WEEK LATER

1067
01:19:08,607 --> 01:19:10,165
What are you doing?

1068
01:19:17,927 --> 01:19:19,326
I'm hungry.

1069
01:19:23,007 --> 01:19:24,804
I want to go to daddy!

1070
01:19:26,847 --> 01:19:28,075
Alright.

1071
01:19:29,087 --> 01:19:30,156
You go-y.

1072
01:19:44,167 --> 01:19:45,839
Number 14 is calling for water.

1073
01:20:03,047 --> 01:20:04,560
Shit. I'm sorry.

1074
01:20:19,527 --> 01:20:21,006
What is wrong?

1075
01:20:21,407 --> 01:20:22,806
It has been a week.

1076
01:20:23,087 --> 01:20:24,600
He disappeared.

1077
01:20:24,887 --> 01:20:26,286
He will come back.

1078
01:20:26,727 --> 01:20:27,727
Non.

1079
01:20:29,007 --> 01:20:30,326
He's like that.

1080
01:20:59,767 --> 01:21:01,246
Nice to show you.

1081
01:21:03,767 --> 01:21:04,961
Sorry,

1082
01:21:05,727 --> 01:21:07,240
I shouldn't have left.

1083
01:21:07,927 --> 01:21:09,565
Why are you gone?

1084
01:21:10,047 --> 01:21:11,241
Because...

1085
01:21:13,727 --> 01:21:15,126
I was ashamed.

1086
01:21:15,407 --> 01:21:17,125
I thought you left.

1087
01:21:17,847 --> 01:21:19,917
I was. I had to come back.

1088
01:21:21,407 --> 01:21:22,601
For what?

1089
01:21:23,207 --> 01:21:24,606
Tell you I'm sorry.

1090
01:21:25,727 --> 01:21:28,685
I didn't try to trick you.
I want you to know.

1091
01:21:29,607 --> 01:21:31,359
I never wanted
to put you in danger.

1092
01:21:32,487 --> 01:21:34,478
- You can't live here anymore.
- I know.

1093
01:21:34,687 --> 01:21:36,678
- What if Ben had been there?
- I know.

1094
01:21:37,887 --> 01:21:39,684
It was worse than stupid.

1095
01:21:43,127 --> 01:21:44,640
Comment from Ben?

1096
01:21:45,047 --> 01:21:47,515
He's fine.
He hates me, but that's all.

1097
01:21:48,007 --> 01:21:49,520
- He doesn't hate you.
- He hates me.

1098
01:21:50,127 --> 01:21:51,355
He's at Doug's.

1099
01:21:51,567 --> 01:21:53,478
He still wants to go to Doug's.

1100
01:21:56,767 --> 01:21:57,916
And now?

1101
01:21:58,127 --> 01:22:00,322
Are you going to look for an apartment?
A work?

1102
01:22:01,087 --> 01:22:02,679
I can't stay here.

1103
01:22:04,127 --> 01:22:05,401
Why not?

1104
01:22:05,887 --> 01:22:08,242
Vince knows I'm here.
He will come back.

1105
01:22:09,527 --> 01:22:10,926
Where are you going?

1106
01:22:12,687 --> 01:22:14,245
I'm going back east.

1107
01:22:14,447 --> 01:22:16,483
You came back to tell me
you were leaving.

1108
01:22:17,927 --> 01:22:19,485
I want you to come with me.

1109
01:22:20,287 --> 01:22:21,287
What?

1110
01:22:22,047 --> 01:22:23,844
I want you to come with me.

1111
01:22:24,567 --> 01:22:26,398
- You're crazy.
- Think.

1112
01:22:27,287 --> 01:22:28,879
We will cross the country.

1113
01:22:29,487 --> 01:22:30,886
Just the two of us.

1114
01:22:32,647 --> 01:22:35,207
We will stay in small motels,

1115
01:22:35,407 --> 01:22:37,204
we will eat sweets.

1116
01:22:38,407 --> 01:22:40,637
We'll see everything
you need to see.

1117
01:22:40,807 --> 01:22:42,718
Le Grand Canyon, Walden Pond.

1118
01:22:44,887 --> 01:22:46,718
We can go to New York.

1119
01:22:47,207 --> 01:22:48,925
I will show you around.

1120
01:22:49,607 --> 01:22:51,245
I'll show you everything

1121
01:22:51,407 --> 01:22:52,999
how to take the metro,

1122
01:22:53,207 --> 01:22:55,118
how to cheat for shows.

1123
01:22:56,527 --> 01:22:59,678
I'll take you to the Metropolitan.
You can explain the paintings to me.

1124
01:23:01,607 --> 01:23:03,563
You can go to school.

1125
01:23:05,687 --> 01:23:07,643
You can do whatever you want.

1126
01:23:09,767 --> 01:23:11,120
Attends.

1127
01:23:13,807 --> 01:23:16,002
I wrote something for you.

1128
01:23:17,167 --> 01:23:18,646
For real this time.

1129
01:23:22,807 --> 01:23:24,604
"From behind your book,

1130
01:23:24,927 --> 01:23:26,519
"you caught my eye

1131
01:23:27,927 --> 01:23:29,997
"with your hurt and discreet air.

1132
01:23:32,527 --> 01:23:34,165
"And like a book,

1133
01:23:34,447 --> 01:23:35,846
"you captured me,

1134
01:23:36,967 --> 01:23:38,446
"chuchotant de mysteriouse.

1135
01:23:40,287 --> 01:23:42,517
"And although
I ask for the imaginary,

1136
01:23:43,207 --> 01:23:44,765
"You served me the truth,

1137
01:23:46,047 --> 01:23:48,766
"revealing myself to myself.

1138
01:23:49,567 --> 01:23:51,080
"Now I understand

1139
01:23:51,487 --> 01:23:53,284
"and our story continues.

1140
01:23:55,167 --> 01:23:56,919
"My eyes are rested,

1141
01:23:58,087 --> 01:24:00,282
"my heart is revived,

1142
01:24:01,687 --> 01:24:04,076
"You are the book that
I can no longer close."

1143
01:25:03,007 --> 01:25:04,156
Ready?

1144
01:25:07,967 --> 01:25:09,241
Let's go.

1145
01:25:15,367 --> 01:25:17,323
Enumère 5 types of bagels.

1146
01:25:17,647 --> 01:25:19,239
Your Jewish side comes out.

1147
01:25:20,687 --> 01:25:22,405
La ferme!
Les bagels. Go!

1148
01:25:24,127 --> 01:25:25,276
With eggs.

1149
01:25:25,447 --> 01:25:26,516
At the water.

1150
01:25:26,847 --> 01:25:28,280
Sesame seeds.

1151
01:25:28,447 --> 01:25:30,039
Jalapeño cheese.

1152
01:25:30,447 --> 01:25:31,641
Black cumin.

1153
01:25:32,967 --> 01:25:34,241
Poppy.

1154
01:25:34,847 --> 01:25:35,916
I got you.

1155
01:25:36,087 --> 01:25:38,396
I prefer to play when you're high.

1156
01:25:42,007 --> 01:25:43,486
I need to pee.

1157
01:25:55,767 --> 01:25:57,086
I will be back.

1158
01:26:43,447 --> 01:26:44,846
I can't leave.

1159
01:27:04,367 --> 01:27:07,040
This is where history fails.

1160
01:27:07,687 --> 01:27:08,802
How so?

1161
01:27:09,487 --> 01:27:12,081
She does not provide the words
for this kind of situation.

1162
01:27:13,487 --> 01:27:14,681
And Literature?

1163
01:27:16,807 --> 01:27:19,844
"What's that feeling when
you walk away from people

1164
01:27:20,047 --> 01:27:23,437
"and fade until
their silhouette disappears.

1165
01:27:25,047 --> 01:27:27,083
"It's a universe that goes beyond us

1166
01:27:27,247 --> 01:27:28,839
"and that's goodbye."

1167
01:27:30,367 --> 01:27:31,880
- I'm sorry.
- Dont be.

1168
01:27:34,247 --> 01:27:35,805
It was fun.

1169
01:27:55,687 --> 01:27:57,040
Behave well.

1170
01:28:26,247 --> 01:28:27,441
What are you doing?

1171
01:28:28,447 --> 01:28:30,438
There's more room here.

1172
01:28:33,607 --> 01:28:34,926
I can help you?

1173
01:28:58,807 --> 01:29:00,240
Which one is it?

1174
01:29:01,687 --> 01:29:02,802
UCLA.

1175
01:29:03,527 --> 01:29:05,882
Why your mother's maiden name?

1176
01:29:06,847 --> 01:29:08,439
Connections with the Mafia.

1177
01:29:09,447 --> 01:29:11,403
I always knew it would happen.

1178
01:29:11,727 --> 01:29:14,321
You're going to go to school
and forget about me.

1179
01:29:15,287 --> 01:29:17,960
I am not yet admitted
and I will continue to live here.

1180
01:29:18,127 --> 01:29:19,446
Will you make the trip?

1181
01:29:21,647 --> 01:29:23,205
Do you eat fries?

1182
01:29:23,807 --> 01:29:26,162
What is the problem?

1183
01:29:26,327 --> 01:29:28,124
I didn't know you liked that.

1184
01:29:29,327 --> 01:29:31,557
You didn't tell me if
you were coming to the party?

1185
01:29:33,287 --> 01:29:34,640
You too force pass.

1186
01:29:35,247 --> 01:29:36,760
I don't want tonight.

1187
01:29:36,927 --> 01:29:38,519
But soon, I promise you.

1188
01:29:41,207 --> 01:29:43,243
I didn't tell you what happened
at the supermarket.

1189
01:29:43,407 --> 01:29:46,683
I was in line and
the bag guy, very cute,

1190
01:29:47,647 --> 01:29:48,921
looked at me.

1191
01:29:49,087 --> 01:29:51,203
That's great, let's go see him
after lunch.

1192
01:29:51,687 --> 01:29:53,120
We're not going to spy on him.

1193
01:29:53,287 --> 01:29:54,287
For what?

1194
01:29:54,407 --> 01:29:55,840
He's gonna think we're nuts.

1195
01:29:56,007 --> 01:29:58,396
- You said he liked you.
- I said "maybe".

1196
01:30:08,567 --> 01:30:10,478
I came to wear this.

1197
01:30:10,647 --> 01:30:12,126
The paint is dry.

1198
01:30:13,927 --> 01:30:15,599
I didn't thank you.

1199
01:30:16,647 --> 01:30:17,682
It's good.

1200
01:30:18,527 --> 01:30:19,880
Jordan no longer lives here.

1201
01:30:20,047 --> 01:30:22,038
I know. Ben me l'a dit.

1202
01:30:24,127 --> 01:30:25,719
Ben loves you very much.

1203
01:30:26,407 --> 01:30:27,760
I am happy.

1204
01:30:28,007 --> 01:30:29,725
He doesn't know you like I do.

1205
01:30:30,407 --> 01:30:32,398
I am no longer the same man.

1206
01:30:33,567 --> 01:30:35,842
I'm not sure I can trust you.

1207
01:30:38,527 --> 01:30:40,119
I keep an eye on you.

1208
01:30:41,687 --> 01:30:43,006
It's normal.

1209
01:30:44,847 --> 01:30:45,962
In between.

1210
01:30:59,767 --> 01:31:01,325
Hi Charlie, hi dad.

1211
01:31:01,967 --> 01:31:03,002
Look at!

1212
01:31:05,367 --> 01:31:06,367
Damn it.

1213
01:31:06,407 --> 01:31:08,079
Look what I brought back.

1214
01:31:08,247 --> 01:31:09,247
Cool.

1215
01:31:10,767 --> 01:31:11,961
Take this.

1216
01:31:13,647 --> 01:31:15,126
- Attack me.
- You're sure?

1217
01:31:15,527 --> 01:31:16,527
And guard.

1218
01:31:19,647 --> 01:31:21,160
Do it in slow motion.

1219
01:31:29,527 --> 01:31:30,880
Give it to dad.
