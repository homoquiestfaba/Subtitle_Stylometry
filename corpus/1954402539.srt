from my bother tonight, ok?

don't think he's ever uh...

197

Either way, it was the
end of the dynamic duo.

199

we can catch a little batting practice?

gonna hit a homer today?

Maybe, he's been roping them lately.

209
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,702
We have some new developments
right now on a 747 that made an

210
00:15:02,737 --> 00:15:05,605
emergency landing at
JFK airport this morning.

211
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,574
It happened at 7:33.

212
00:15:07,608 --> 00:15:10,910
We're told it was a Santa
Mira Airlines flight 209.

213

Reports that we're getting
say it hit turbulence

on it's decent, and that
a passenger actually aided

215
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:19,119
in the safe landing of that plane.

216
00:15:19,153 --> 00:15:21,621
The plane flew into some
kind of crazy weather pattern.

217
00:15:21,655 --> 00:15:23,356
And a shark got sucked up into the engine.

218

219
00:15:24,792 --> 00:15:26,859
Hard to believe that a storm
bigger than anything you've ever

220
00:15:26,894 --> 00:15:29,095
seen before is about to hit
Manhattan? Well guess what?

221
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:31,210
It's about to happen, so here's the deal...

222
00:15:31,232 --> 00:15:33,032
You need to lock down the city.

223
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:35,602
You need to call the Mayor and have
him put the National Guard on alert.

224
00:15:35,636 --> 00:15:38,671
Get helicopters in the air with firebombs
so they can throw them into the tornado.

225
00:15:38,706 --> 00:15:40,640
Ok, I can see you're upset...

226
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:42,208
I'm not crazy.

227
00:15:42,243 --> 00:15:44,077
You gotta alert the city.

228
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:46,392

truth before it happens again.

Matt, this is nuts. We've already had
record breaking heat. Now we're talking

384
00:23:06,526 --> 00:23:09,540
- about the potential of snow fall.
- Snow in July.

We have this artic air
mass. It's coming in.

388

least 3 to 4 inches of snow.

it's going to bring wind. And it
is going to bring torrential rains.

a chance to put my family back together.

Didn't you try to stop him?

1058
01:01:12,386 --> 01:01:15,422
I did but wanted to make sure
that you two guys got here.

1059
01:01:16,724 --> 01:01:19,125

1067
01:02:09,643 --> 01:02:12,545
We gotta work quick
before the twisters merge!

1068
01:02:17,751 --> 01:02:19,919
You sure this is gonna work?

1069
01:02:24,225 --> 01:02:26,659
How are we gonna get
these into the storm?

1070
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:28,495
I gotcha.

1071
01:02:28,562 --> 01:02:30,063
- Sling shot.
- Nice.

1072
01:02:30,131 --> 01:02:32,632
Told you to trust me.

1073
01:02:37,976 --> 01:02:41,217
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Where
you going Ellen? Where you going?

1074
01:02:41,242 --> 01:02:42,742
I'm going up there.

1075
01:02:42,810 --> 01:02:45,145
Fin was very specific. We're not
supposed to get ourselves killed.

1076
01:02:45,212 --> 01:02:47,213
So it's ok for him, but it's not Ok for me?

1077
01:02:47,281 --> 01:02:48,815
Mom!

1078
01:02:48,883 --> 01:02:50,416
Just stop.

1079
01:02:50,484 --> 01:02:52,886
- Mora: Stay here.
- Martin: Stay here.

1080
01:02:52,953 --> 01:02:54,354
Stay here.

1081
01:02:55,114 --> 01:02:56,726
We are now receiving reports that the

1082
01:02:56,752 --> 01:02:58,634
twisters from the rivers
are about to merge.

1083
01:02:58,659 --> 01:03:02,295
Apparently this will happen
right over the Bales Tower hotel.

1084
01:03:02,363 --> 01:03:04,291
And Al, the big question is first of all,

1085
01:03:04,292 --> 01:03:06,925
what is drawing these
two twisters together?

1086
01:03:06,967 --> 01:03:10,036
And I don't even want to ask but
what happens when they finally meet?

1087
01:03:10,104 --> 01:03:13,339
Matt, I am really nervous about this.
If fact, I'll say I'm down right scared.

1088
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:15,812
Here's the problem. The island of Manhattan

1089
01:03:15,813 --> 01:03:18,670
creates a lot of heat.
As the hot air rises,

1090
01:03:18,712 --> 01:03:21,857
cool air is sucked in to replace it.

1091
01:03:21,883 --> 01:03:25,476
That affect is drawing
these Sharknadoes to the very

1092
01:03:25,519 --> 01:03:30,256
heart of this city. Now if
these two EF2 tornadoes merge...

1093
01:03:30,324 --> 01:03:34,427
their power can actually multiply. We
could be talking about an EF5 Sharknado

1094
01:03:34,495 --> 01:03:39,065
on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
Matt, that's sufficient power enough

1095
01:03:39,133 --> 01:03:42,101
to damage steel reinforced sky scrapers.

1096
01:03:42,169 --> 01:03:44,571
I've never seen anything
like this. Stay with us, Al.

1097
01:03:44,638 --> 01:03:47,452
We go live to Manhattan with
weatherman, Raphael Miranda.

1098
01:03:47,478 --> 01:03:48,933
From our local station that's

1099
01:03:48,976 --> 01:03:53,546
NBC 4. Can you tell us a little bit more
about what's happening down there, Raphael?

1100
01:03:53,614 --> 01:03:57,217
Thanks Matt. This storm is already taking
a toll on the city. The residence are

1101
01:03:57,284 --> 01:04:01,321

that keep raining down from the sky.

in downtown Manhattan.

This is the lightning storm that
damaged the Statue of Liberty.

It appears to be moving
North, at the very same time,

appears to be moving south toward it.

01:10:16,846 --> 01:10:19,114
Ok, so Matt. The tall buildings
of Manhattan seem to be creating

1196
01:10:19,148 --> 01:10:23,285
a wind tunnel effect. Actually drawing
the two storms toward each other.

1197
01:10:23,319 --> 01:10:28,457
Our current radar track shows them both
headed towards the Empire State Building.

converge with the other...

be talking about unprecedented

time. I need to know

- Yeah.

arrived at the Empire State Building.

happened, it didn't go so well.

didn't really appreciate it.

together. We fight together.

meet in about eight minutes.

01:12:16,299 --> 01:12:17,866

I don't understand.

01:12:19,068 --> 01:12:20,102
What's your plan?

1233
01:12:20,136 --> 01:12:21,737
Well we can't equalize
the pressure with a bomb.

1234
01:12:21,771 --> 01:12:23,839
It's too dangerous. And the
twisters are to cold, right?

1235
01:12:23,873 --> 01:12:26,341
Right.

1236
01:12:26,376 --> 01:12:29,378
Well if I can't blow it
out, I'll freeze it out.

1237
01:12:29,645 --> 01:12:32,714
I'll throw the freon tank into the storm.

1238
01:12:33,883 --> 01:12:38,353
I have no idea if that's going
to work. But it's a moot point.

1239
01:12:38,388 --> 01:12:41,790
We don't have the explosives
here to make that happen.

1240
01:12:41,824 --> 01:12:43,258
That's why we're going to use
the lightning rod, to blow the

1241
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:45,761
freon tank through the
building into the storm.

1242
01:12:45,795 --> 01:12:47,129
That's crazy. You're going to get killed.

1243
01:12:47,163 --> 01:12:49,965
Maybe not. But that's why
I'm going to do it by myself.

1244
01:12:49,999 --> 01:12:51,642
No, no, no. I'm coming
with you, I almost lost

1245
01:12:51,643 --> 01:12:53,268

to do it, you gotta get up there now.

1249
01:13:06,749 --> 01:13:10,485
Alright. If this works it's going to
take all the power out of the storm.

1250
01:13:10,887 --> 01:13:13,155
And there's a lot of sharks up there still.

1251
01:13:13,756 --> 01:13:15,857
