1
00:00:58,038 --> 00:01:02,475
The key is listening to the signals
and hearing what they're saying.

2
00:01:02,542 --> 00:01:05,306
If she touches you soft,

3
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:07,779
that's how she wants to be touched.

4
00:01:07,848 --> 00:01:11,181
You do that until you can hear her get wet.

5
00:01:11,251 --> 00:01:13,947
You gotta know women. I'm serious.

6
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,113
Last time I went home,
my girl was so grateful,

7
00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:18,384
she went right outside
and started washing my car.

8
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:20,289
Detailed it.

9
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,726
Everything. Just to thank me.

10
00:01:24,698 --> 00:01:26,256
Now, we gotta stop talking about pussy

11
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:28,824
'cause if we're not careful,
this is gonna get us killed.

12
00:01:28,902 --> 00:01:29,960
Especially in this neighborhood,

13
00:01:30,036 --> 00:01:32,061
and I'm not gonna let pussy get us killed.

14
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,598
Wanna go left?

15
00:01:35,675 --> 00:01:37,267
All right, get around this right here.

16
00:01:37,344 --> 00:01:38,436
Move left.

17
00:01:39,546 --> 00:01:40,979
Watch it.

18
00:01:41,047 --> 00:01:42,708
Come on, man.
You gotta speed up.

19
00:01:43,984 --> 00:01:46,145
Sarnt, you ever had
two girls at the same...

20
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:49,550
Go! Go! Go!

21
00:01:49,623 --> 00:01:51,090
Go! Go!

22
00:01:51,158 --> 00:01:52,284
Fire! Fire! West!

23
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:54,020
I.E.D. I.E.D. I.E.D.

24
00:01:54,094 --> 00:01:56,585
Five points south of Najaf.

25
00:01:56,663 --> 00:01:57,595
Third vehicle.

26
00:01:57,664 --> 00:01:58,596
We got it.

27
00:01:58,665 --> 00:02:00,394
That was fucked up!

28
00:02:01,735 --> 00:02:02,827
Came right through the door!

29
00:02:02,903 --> 00:02:04,029
Shit, that was close.

30
00:02:04,104 --> 00:02:05,662
You all right, sir?

31
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:06,671
What?

32
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,640
You all right?

33
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:10,335
Yeah.

34
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,434
Sarnt, look.

35
00:02:11,511 --> 00:02:12,443
What?

36
00:02:12,512 --> 00:02:14,070
Look at your pants, Sir.

37
00:02:41,174 --> 00:02:43,438
Did you tell your girlfriend
what happened yet?

38
00:02:44,945 --> 00:02:46,378
No, sir.

39
00:02:47,547 --> 00:02:48,844
You're gonna have to tell her.

40
00:02:48,915 --> 00:02:51,884
I'll tell her when it's working again, sir.

41
00:02:51,952 --> 00:02:54,512
Okay.

42
00:02:54,588 --> 00:02:58,388
But you don't become
functional overnight.

43
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:00,892
You're gonna have to be
patient with yourself.

44
00:03:00,961 --> 00:03:03,122
She's gonna have to be
patient with you.

45
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:06,462
Can you do that?

46
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:07,898
I guess.

47
00:03:09,369 --> 00:03:11,234
All right, then.

48
00:03:11,304 --> 00:03:14,137
Good luck to you, Sergeant.

49
00:03:14,207 --> 00:03:16,107
Thank you, sir.

50
00:03:22,415 --> 00:03:23,541
I've gotta be on there.

51
00:03:23,617 --> 00:03:24,982
I don't want to miss this plane.

52
00:03:25,051 --> 00:03:25,881
Told you already.

53
00:03:25,952 --> 00:03:27,715
- You gotta see the MCNCO.
- Thank you.

54
00:03:27,787 --> 00:03:29,914
- Airport?
- Yeah.

55
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,924
Sergeant T.K. Poole.

56
00:03:33,493 --> 00:03:37,429
Listen, buddy, all I want to do
is get back to my wife and kid.

57
00:03:37,497 --> 00:03:40,159
- You gotta help me out here.
- I just go by the list.

58
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:41,860
Can I see the list?

59
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,973
Hey. Here it is.

60
00:03:52,045 --> 00:03:53,034
Hey.

61
00:03:54,381 --> 00:03:55,678
Sergeant Fred Cheaver.

62
00:03:55,749 --> 00:03:57,512
648. Reserves.

63
00:03:57,584 --> 00:03:59,643
Hello. It's right here.

64
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:01,152
That's how you spell it?

65
00:04:01,221 --> 00:04:02,813
With a C-H?

66
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:04,857
How else would you spell Cheaver?

67
00:04:04,925 --> 00:04:06,324
Probably lots of ways.

68
00:04:06,393 --> 00:04:08,452
Not in English.

69
00:04:08,528 --> 00:04:12,988
<i>Welcome aboard
Flight 6240 to New York.</i>

70
00:04:13,066 --> 00:04:15,591
<i>Our estimated flying time
this evening to JFK</i>

71
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:18,069
<i>will be 8 hours and 20 minutes.</i>

72
00:04:33,153 --> 00:04:34,518
Hey.

73
00:04:34,588 --> 00:04:36,249
We're all on the same team.

74
00:04:37,624 --> 00:04:38,556
You got leave?

75
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:39,683
Yeah. 30 days.

76
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,021
Oh, yeah?

77
00:04:41,094 --> 00:04:42,186
Me, too.

78
00:04:42,262 --> 00:04:44,127
How long you got?

79
00:04:44,197 --> 00:04:46,688
The rest of my life,
thank you very much.

80
00:04:46,766 --> 00:04:48,358
My tour's over.

81
00:04:48,435 --> 00:04:49,902
I'm going home.

82
00:05:16,796 --> 00:05:18,787
If we go down in the water...

83
00:05:18,865 --> 00:05:20,560
you're gonna be sitting pretty.

84
00:05:22,435 --> 00:05:23,424
What?

85
00:05:24,471 --> 00:05:28,134
I said if we crash in the ocean,
your donut's gonna come in handy.

86
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,403
It'll be like an extra life preserver.

87
00:05:30,477 --> 00:05:33,207
If we crash in the ocean,
it's not gonna matter.

88
00:05:34,214 --> 00:05:37,547
Don't talk about planes crashing
when you're on a plane.

89
00:05:37,617 --> 00:05:38,914
Why not?

90
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,784
It's basic common sense.

91
00:05:41,855 --> 00:05:44,949
It's the same reason
that when you're on a cruise ship,

92
00:05:45,025 --> 00:05:46,219
<i>they're not showing Titanic.</i>

93
00:05:46,292 --> 00:05:47,281
It scares people.

94
00:05:49,462 --> 00:05:54,456
Who wants to think about
drunk pilots and midair collisions?

95
00:05:54,534 --> 00:05:57,162
Nothing you can do about it, anyway.

96
00:06:09,015 --> 00:06:10,812
It's good to be home.

97
00:06:14,688 --> 00:06:16,383
We're gonna miss the whole thing.

98
00:06:18,692 --> 00:06:19,750
What the hell?

99
00:06:23,196 --> 00:06:25,664
<i>Please do not leave
your baggage unattended.</i>

100
00:06:25,732 --> 00:06:28,963
<i>All unattended baggage
will be confiscated.</i>

101
00:06:29,035 --> 00:06:30,525
Oh, God. I gotta get to Vegas.

102
00:06:30,603 --> 00:06:32,628
I can't be sitting around here.

103
00:06:32,706 --> 00:06:34,469
You're going to Vegas?

104
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:36,270
Yeah. I'm going to Vegas.

105
00:06:36,342 --> 00:06:39,311
- Hey, are you going to Vegas?
- St. Louis.

106
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:40,641
Excuse me.

107
00:06:40,714 --> 00:06:43,205
Do you know what happened here,
why all the flights are cancelled?

108
00:06:43,283 --> 00:06:44,477
There was a blackout here.

109
00:06:44,551 --> 00:06:46,280
The city was dark for five hours.

110
00:06:46,352 --> 00:06:48,582
The lights just came back on
a little while ago.

111
00:06:50,557 --> 00:06:52,684
The lights are back on in the Northeast,

112
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:54,317
but the planes are still not moving.

113
00:06:54,394 --> 00:06:57,522
Airline officials say it could be
at least two days

114
00:06:57,597 --> 00:06:59,656
until they get their planes
to the right airports

115
00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:00,859
and resume their schedules.

116
00:07:00,934 --> 00:07:02,959
- Two days.
- Yeah.

117
00:07:03,036 --> 00:07:05,004
They don't know shit.

118
00:07:05,071 --> 00:07:07,130
Supposedly, planes are flying
out of Pittsburgh,

119
00:07:07,207 --> 00:07:09,175
but they can't even get us there
till tomorrow night.

120
00:07:09,242 --> 00:07:11,142
And even that's a big maybe.

121
00:07:12,912 --> 00:07:14,539
Well, it's nice meeting you all.

122
00:07:14,614 --> 00:07:15,842
I'm outta here.

123
00:07:15,915 --> 00:07:17,007
Good luck.

124
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,015
Where are you goin'?

125
00:07:18,084 --> 00:07:20,678
I want to rent a car
before there's none left.

126
00:07:20,754 --> 00:07:22,654
It's 14 hours to St. Louis.

127
00:07:22,722 --> 00:07:26,021
Drive all night, be there
having dinner with my wife tomorrow.

128
00:07:26,092 --> 00:07:29,061
Sure as shit not gonna stay here
while they run out of food and water.

129
00:07:39,773 --> 00:07:41,707
Hey, man.

130
00:07:41,775 --> 00:07:44,039
I bet you planes
are flying out of St. Louis.

131
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,873
Probably.

132
00:07:45,945 --> 00:07:48,539
Maybe I can catch a flight
to Vegas from there.

133
00:07:48,615 --> 00:07:50,048
Me, too.

134
00:07:52,952 --> 00:07:55,944
Okay. But we split
everything three ways...

135
00:07:56,022 --> 00:07:58,616
gas, rental, insurance, everything.

136
00:07:58,691 --> 00:08:00,318
No free rides.

137
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,534
That's it. Sorry. No cars left.

138
00:08:14,474 --> 00:08:15,736
You got nothing?

139
00:08:15,809 --> 00:08:18,039
Nothing.

140
00:08:18,111 --> 00:08:19,169
Can you believe this?

141
00:08:19,245 --> 00:08:21,236
Maybe we can call the Army.

142
00:08:22,415 --> 00:08:24,280
The Army?
What's the Army gonna do?

143
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,511
You guys in the Army?

144
00:08:26,586 --> 00:08:27,780
Yeah.

145
00:08:28,988 --> 00:08:29,920
Were you over there?

146
00:08:29,989 --> 00:08:31,820
Just got back.

147
00:08:33,393 --> 00:08:35,156
Come here.

148
00:08:35,228 --> 00:08:36,559
All right, listen.

149
00:08:36,629 --> 00:08:38,062
I do have one car left.

150
00:08:38,131 --> 00:08:40,463
I'm supposed to hold it
for my boss, but screw it.

151
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:41,557
You guys can have it.

152
00:08:41,634 --> 00:08:45,035
Oh, my God. That's so nice!

153
00:08:45,104 --> 00:08:46,036
Thank you!

154
00:08:46,105 --> 00:08:47,265
Oh, no.

155
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,807
Thank you.

156
00:09:05,191 --> 00:09:06,681
Sure is beautiful.

157
00:09:08,895 --> 00:09:10,453
I guess we don't have time to stop.

158
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,725
No. We don't have time to stop.

159
00:09:15,869 --> 00:09:18,064
I never been to New York before.

160
00:09:18,137 --> 00:09:19,297
You been to New York, Sarnt?

161
00:09:19,372 --> 00:09:21,237
I'm stationed at Fort Drum.

162
00:09:21,307 --> 00:09:22,899
I've been there a million times.

163
00:09:22,976 --> 00:09:24,910
I thought you were from Las Vegas.

164
00:09:24,978 --> 00:09:26,502
No.

165
00:09:32,218 --> 00:09:34,209
I'm not from Las Vegas, either.

166
00:09:35,555 --> 00:09:37,045
Well, my friend's from there.

167
00:09:37,123 --> 00:09:39,421
That's his guitar.

168
00:09:39,492 --> 00:09:40,424
Well, it was his guitar.

169
00:09:40,493 --> 00:09:44,862
I mean, he got killed,
so I'm just taking it back to his family.

170
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:47,764
That's a real nice thing to be doing.

171
00:10:08,421 --> 00:10:11,254
You must be a good dancer, huh?

172
00:10:11,324 --> 00:10:13,622
Oh, no. My wife's a good dancer.

173
00:10:13,693 --> 00:10:16,355
I just try to keep up.

174
00:10:16,429 --> 00:10:19,091
She loves all those Latin dances.

175
00:10:19,165 --> 00:10:22,532
Samba, merengue, tango.

176
00:10:22,602 --> 00:10:24,536
She's a looker, huh?

177
00:10:24,604 --> 00:10:27,402
Yes, she is. Yeah.

178
00:10:27,473 --> 00:10:29,941
What she's doing with someone like me,

179
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:32,409
I'll never know, and I'm not gonna ask.

180
00:10:33,513 --> 00:10:35,879
We're lucky ones, aren't we?

181
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:38,543
We made it through in one piece.

182
00:10:38,618 --> 00:10:42,714
I got shot in the leg, but all I gotta do
is put some goo on it, so...

183
00:10:42,789 --> 00:10:45,451
Did you get shot... Sarnt?

184
00:10:45,525 --> 00:10:48,460
No. I caught a piece of shrapnel.

185
00:10:50,129 --> 00:10:51,061
Where?

186
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,893
Outside of Najaf.

187
00:10:52,966 --> 00:10:55,196
No. I mean where on your body.

188
00:10:56,202 --> 00:10:57,897
Thigh.

189
00:10:57,971 --> 00:11:00,166
Upper thigh.

190
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:01,263
How about you, Sarnt?

191
00:11:02,642 --> 00:11:05,770
I had back surgery.
Three crushed vertebrae.

192
00:11:05,845 --> 00:11:06,971
What happened?

193
00:11:09,048 --> 00:11:11,243
Porto John fell on me.

194
00:11:11,317 --> 00:11:12,443
What?

195
00:11:12,518 --> 00:11:13,746
Was it full?

196
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,583
No. It was...

197
00:11:15,655 --> 00:11:17,020
It was brand-spanking-new.

198
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,580
It was completely sanitary.

199
00:11:18,658 --> 00:11:21,183
We were setting up a camp
outside of Bandar,

200
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,160
and it fell off a forklift.

201
00:11:23,229 --> 00:11:24,821
Well, don't tell the ladies that.

202
00:11:24,897 --> 00:11:27,263
You gotta find something
better than that.

203
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,823
You kidding?

204
00:11:28,901 --> 00:11:30,994
I love that Porto John.

205
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:33,038
Best thing that ever happened to me.

206
00:11:33,106 --> 00:11:35,233
A week later, my unit
shipped off to Mosul,

207
00:11:35,308 --> 00:11:36,775
got shot to pieces.

208
00:11:36,843 --> 00:11:38,606
The shitter saved my life.

209
00:11:39,612 --> 00:11:42,672
Wish I could've brought it home,
set up a shrine.

210
00:11:45,184 --> 00:11:48,278
If I have another kid,
I'm gonna name him Porto John.

211
00:11:48,354 --> 00:11:49,946
That's...

212
00:11:50,023 --> 00:11:51,786
Porto John Cheaver.

213
00:12:02,702 --> 00:12:03,726
They all look so good.

214
00:12:03,803 --> 00:12:05,600
I don't know what to order.

215
00:12:05,671 --> 00:12:07,036
What can I get for you?

216
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:11,271
Give me the Number 8, the Number 9,
and the Number 10.

217
00:12:11,344 --> 00:12:13,312
Coffee, orange juice, and milk.

218
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,778
Good, huh?

219
00:12:23,222 --> 00:12:24,621
I tell you, this woman's smart.

220
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:26,658
She's got plans for us.

221
00:12:26,726 --> 00:12:29,490
You... Can't...
She's dying to get married

222
00:12:29,562 --> 00:12:30,859
'cause I'm her ticket to the top.

223
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:32,921
How are you her ticket to the top?

224
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:35,024
She's a lieutenant.
She outranks you.

225
00:12:35,101 --> 00:12:36,568
No. Right now she does.

226
00:12:36,636 --> 00:12:37,728
I mean, she's got the connections,

227
00:12:37,804 --> 00:12:39,328
but I got the juice.

228
00:12:39,405 --> 00:12:41,896
I mean, it's like a merger between us.

229
00:12:41,974 --> 00:12:44,670
You know? She's gonna get me
into Officer Candidate School.

230
00:12:44,744 --> 00:12:46,439
I'm gonna move up the ranks.

231
00:12:46,512 --> 00:12:48,377
Then I'm gonna run for office.

232
00:12:48,448 --> 00:12:50,643
And you have to have
a good head of hair to run for office,

233
00:12:50,716 --> 00:12:52,149
and I have a good head of hair.

234
00:12:53,419 --> 00:12:56,388
So your fiancée is meeting you in Vegas?

235
00:12:56,456 --> 00:12:58,720
No. She's stationed at Fort Dix.

236
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,019
I'm gonna meet her there afterwards.

237
00:13:00,093 --> 00:13:02,357
Oh, I get it.

238
00:13:02,428 --> 00:13:04,328
First, a little fun at the tittie bars.

239
00:13:04,397 --> 00:13:06,865
No. I got business to take care of.

240
00:13:06,933 --> 00:13:09,458
You paying back a gambling debt?

241
00:13:09,535 --> 00:13:10,524
Wrong again.

242
00:13:11,537 --> 00:13:14,199
Randy had a gambling debt.

243
00:13:14,273 --> 00:13:15,535
Yep.

244
00:13:15,608 --> 00:13:17,940
That's why he had to rob Lucky Jim's.

245
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:21,605
He stole $50,000 so he could
pay back the loan sharks.

246
00:13:21,681 --> 00:13:24,479
But then of course,
the cops got on his tail, and...

247
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,040
and that's when he enlisted.

248
00:13:26,119 --> 00:13:27,586
You know, he just went...

249
00:13:27,653 --> 00:13:29,211
went right into the Army
and disappeared.

250
00:13:29,288 --> 00:13:30,653
It was the perfect getaway.

251
00:13:30,723 --> 00:13:33,954
See, that's exactly
what the Army doesn't want.

252
00:13:34,961 --> 00:13:36,861
The Army's got standards.

253
00:13:36,929 --> 00:13:38,419
Like, it... it means something.

254
00:13:38,498 --> 00:13:40,432
It's not like lowlifes and gangbangers.

255
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,558
What?

256
00:13:41,634 --> 00:13:43,898
The last thing we need is trash
like your pal Randy.

257
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,699
- They don't want...
- Fuck you! Fuck you!

258
00:13:45,771 --> 00:13:47,170
- Whoa!
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

259
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,265
That "trash" saved my fucking life!

260
00:13:49,342 --> 00:13:51,572
He pulled me outta that truck
when I got shot!

261
00:13:51,644 --> 00:13:55,045
And he took a fucking bullet
in the fucking head!

262
00:13:55,114 --> 00:13:58,015
All I got left is his fucking guitar!

263
00:14:02,155 --> 00:14:03,782
Get back in the car.

264
00:14:03,856 --> 00:14:04,823
Get back in the car!

265
00:14:04,891 --> 00:14:07,758
I ought to kick your ass!

266
00:14:07,827 --> 00:14:09,089
Oh, you're gonna kick my ass.

267
00:14:09,162 --> 00:14:11,392
Yeah. I could do it, too.

268
00:14:11,464 --> 00:14:13,591
I'd just push you
down a flight of stairs,

269
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,065
punch you in the kidney.

270
00:14:15,134 --> 00:14:16,931
You'd better have eyes
in the back of your head.

271
00:14:17,003 --> 00:14:19,369
This is not... We don't have time
for ass-kicking stops.

272
00:14:19,438 --> 00:14:21,406
You just say you're sorry,
and let's get going.

273
00:14:21,474 --> 00:14:23,465
- I'm not sorry!
- I'm not talking to you.

274
00:14:23,543 --> 00:14:25,807
- Say you're sorry.
- No. I'm not gonna say I'm sorry.

275
00:14:25,878 --> 00:14:28,972
That's like saying I'm sorry
that the sky's blue.

276
00:14:29,048 --> 00:14:30,515
Come on, man. You just...

277
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:32,551
You just insulted her dead friend. Huh?

278
00:14:32,618 --> 00:14:34,313
Come on. Suck it up.

279
00:14:34,387 --> 00:14:35,615
Say you're sorry. Let's go.

280
00:14:35,688 --> 00:14:37,849
I'm sorry that you got so upset.

281
00:14:38,858 --> 00:14:39,790
Okay?

282
00:14:39,859 --> 00:14:41,554
No. That's not an apology.

283
00:14:41,627 --> 00:14:42,889
But it's pretty close.

284
00:14:42,962 --> 00:14:44,054
Come on, let's go.

285
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:46,257
That's not an apology.

286
00:14:47,533 --> 00:14:48,465
Come on. Let me in.

287
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:52,302
Dude, let me in.

288
00:14:52,371 --> 00:14:54,134
I can't.

289
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,141
Just press the key thing, man.

290
00:14:56,209 --> 00:14:57,540
The keys are in the car.

291
00:15:01,214 --> 00:15:02,704
Shit.

292
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,652
What the fuck were you thinking?

293
00:15:09,722 --> 00:15:14,853
I was thinking I had two fucking nut cases
throwing shit, getting into a fight.

294
00:15:14,927 --> 00:15:16,918
- We didn't fight.
- This is not my fault.

295
00:15:16,996 --> 00:15:19,055
Well, it's sure as shit not our fault.

296
00:15:19,131 --> 00:15:20,564
We didn't lock the keys in the car.

297
00:15:20,633 --> 00:15:22,328
Whatever. We need a coat hanger.

298
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:24,494
Coat hanger's not gonna work
on a late model car.

299
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:27,232
You need a Slim Jim.

300
00:15:27,306 --> 00:15:30,434
Well, you know what?
I don't have a Slim Jim.

301
00:15:44,257 --> 00:15:45,246
Thank you.

302
00:15:48,761 --> 00:15:52,197
So, they went on this worldwide tour,

303
00:15:52,265 --> 00:15:55,564
and they... they got...
'cause they got this contract.

304
00:15:55,635 --> 00:15:57,034
And they got to meet the queen,

305
00:15:57,103 --> 00:15:58,661
and they got to meet the president.

306
00:15:58,738 --> 00:16:00,501
And after that,

307
00:16:00,573 --> 00:16:04,236
Randy got the guitar from his daddy,

308
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:06,073
who got it from his granddaddy,

309
00:16:06,145 --> 00:16:08,306
who got it from Elvis.

310
00:16:08,381 --> 00:16:09,541
Elvis.

311
00:16:09,615 --> 00:16:10,582
Come on.

312
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,208
It's true.

313
00:16:12,285 --> 00:16:14,583
That guitar's worth a lot of money.

314
00:16:38,144 --> 00:16:39,975
She's a beaut, don't you think?

315
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,971
Yeah. I already got one, though.

316
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:43,981
- You do?
- Yeah.

317
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:45,642
Me, too.

318
00:16:45,718 --> 00:16:47,652
That's great. What color?

319
00:16:49,822 --> 00:16:52,086
So, how is it over there?

320
00:16:52,158 --> 00:16:53,921
You guys see any action?

321
00:16:53,993 --> 00:16:55,085
- Yep.
- Yeah.

322
00:16:55,161 --> 00:16:56,651
Yeah?

323
00:16:56,729 --> 00:16:58,720
Well, we all think
you're doing a hell of a job.

324
00:16:58,798 --> 00:16:59,856
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

325
00:16:59,932 --> 00:17:01,559
No, no. Thank you.

326
00:17:01,634 --> 00:17:03,829
You know, we get clients all the time

327
00:17:03,903 --> 00:17:07,304
in the dealership who want
their Hummers outfitted just like yours.

328
00:17:07,373 --> 00:17:10,171
The desert camouflage, the whole bit.

329
00:17:10,242 --> 00:17:12,642
One guy even put armor on his H1.

330
00:17:13,713 --> 00:17:15,738
They want bullet holes?

331
00:17:15,815 --> 00:17:18,716
Yeah, they probably do.

332
00:17:18,784 --> 00:17:20,308
Hey, check this out.

333
00:17:20,386 --> 00:17:22,946
Push that third button right back there.

334
00:17:24,023 --> 00:17:24,955
Not bad, huh?

335
00:17:25,024 --> 00:17:26,048
Yeah.

336
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,218
Yeah. Bet you guys
don't have that on your vehicles.

337
00:17:29,462 --> 00:17:30,929
No, sir, we don't.

338
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:41,802
You got it?

339
00:17:41,874 --> 00:17:44,570
- That didn't take long.
- Thank you.

340
00:18:00,893 --> 00:18:02,861
I have to use the bathroom.

341
00:18:05,064 --> 00:18:06,691
I'll pull over by those bushes.

342
00:18:06,766 --> 00:18:08,825
No, I said "use the bathroom,"

343
00:18:08,901 --> 00:18:11,165
not squat by the side of the road.

344
00:18:29,755 --> 00:18:34,021
And the weird and wacky talent
this week is...

345
00:18:44,703 --> 00:18:46,068
Congratulations, Wayne.

346
00:18:58,784 --> 00:19:00,046
All yours.

347
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,554
Do you want to play pool, or...

348
00:19:03,622 --> 00:19:05,055
pinball or something?

349
00:19:05,124 --> 00:19:06,216
Nah. We should get going.

350
00:19:06,292 --> 00:19:07,725
Okay.

351
00:19:20,306 --> 00:19:21,568
Turn it down!

352
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,574
Turn it off!

353
00:19:29,148 --> 00:19:30,809
Is this a good show?

354
00:19:31,817 --> 00:19:32,806
Yeah.

355
00:19:34,153 --> 00:19:36,417
I've never seen it before.
Is it new?

356
00:19:36,489 --> 00:19:37,888
Not that new.

357
00:19:40,292 --> 00:19:41,850
I've haven't really seen
much of anything lately

358
00:19:41,927 --> 00:19:46,261
'cause I've been overseas
the past 14 months, and...

359
00:19:46,332 --> 00:19:47,822
you know, I'm in the Army.

360
00:19:49,168 --> 00:19:50,635
But I'm home on leave for 30 days,

361
00:19:50,703 --> 00:19:54,104
so I'm just... I'm hoping to catch up.

362
00:19:55,674 --> 00:19:57,107
I like your jacket.

363
00:19:58,611 --> 00:19:59,543
It's okay.

364
00:19:59,612 --> 00:20:01,011
What's the "I" stand for?

365
00:20:03,482 --> 00:20:04,779
Indiana.

366
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:08,342
You know, the college and the state

367
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,081
where you're standing right now.

368
00:20:12,191 --> 00:20:16,059
Yeah, you know, I was thinking
of going to college when I get out, but...

369
00:20:16,128 --> 00:20:17,117
Do you like it?

370
00:20:17,196 --> 00:20:19,528
Do you think you could be quiet?

371
00:20:23,135 --> 00:20:25,126
Sure, I can be quiet.

372
00:20:25,204 --> 00:20:26,228
Good.

373
00:20:32,878 --> 00:20:34,311
No way.

374
00:20:52,398 --> 00:20:54,923
You know, I'm limping
because when I was over there,

375
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,365
I got shot in the leg.

376
00:20:56,435 --> 00:20:59,029
That wasn't very smart, was it?

377
00:20:59,104 --> 00:21:00,799
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

378
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,505
Back off! Back off!

379
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:11,550
What's wrong with you guys?

380
00:21:11,617 --> 00:21:12,879
Back off!

381
00:21:13,886 --> 00:21:15,319
Calm down.

382
00:21:15,387 --> 00:21:16,854
No, that's right. Be afraid.

383
00:21:16,922 --> 00:21:18,480
No, be very afraid.

384
00:21:18,557 --> 00:21:19,546
Go, go, go!

385
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:20,557
All right!

386
00:21:28,534 --> 00:21:31,264
Yeah! We won!

387
00:21:31,337 --> 00:21:34,934
Kicked their college asses!

388
00:21:35,007 --> 00:21:38,272
Oh, this girl's crazy.

389
00:21:39,511 --> 00:21:40,671
Yeah.

390
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,371
Just glad I didn't have my weapon.

391
00:22:02,201 --> 00:22:05,762
TV! TV! TV!

392
00:22:11,377 --> 00:22:13,538
- I wish we had some booze.
- Yeah.

393
00:22:13,612 --> 00:22:15,910
Check my bag.

394
00:22:15,981 --> 00:22:18,779
Doctor in Germany gave me
a bottle of schnapps.

395
00:22:23,856 --> 00:22:27,257
And a tough night here at the arena
for the home team.

396
00:22:27,326 --> 00:22:28,918
- Thank you.
- All right.

397
00:22:38,103 --> 00:22:39,070
Not bad.

398
00:22:40,372 --> 00:22:43,170
I mean, what you really want
after a fight is whiskey

399
00:22:43,242 --> 00:22:45,107
'cause it mellows you out.

400
00:22:45,177 --> 00:22:48,408
If you want to get mean, you drink gin,

401
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,449
vodka if you want to zone out,

402
00:22:51,517 --> 00:22:53,542
and you save tequila
for when you want to get crazy.

403
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,210
She didn't need tequila tonight.

404
00:23:00,192 --> 00:23:02,023
Did anybody see a straw around here?

405
00:23:03,529 --> 00:23:04,621
No. Why?

406
00:23:04,697 --> 00:23:06,187
'Cause if you drink through a straw,

407
00:23:06,265 --> 00:23:08,096
it gets you drunker.

408
00:23:08,167 --> 00:23:09,156
That's not true.

409
00:23:09,234 --> 00:23:10,428
Of course it is.

410
00:23:10,502 --> 00:23:11,434
That's ridiculous.

411
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:14,403
How could that be true?

412
00:23:14,473 --> 00:23:17,465
Well, I don't really know how it works.

413
00:23:17,543 --> 00:23:19,636
It just... It...

414
00:23:19,712 --> 00:23:21,942
It just gets in...
It just goes in faster.

415
00:23:22,014 --> 00:23:24,141
Oh, it's just one of...

416
00:23:24,216 --> 00:23:25,683
one of the mysteries of life?

417
00:23:25,751 --> 00:23:27,719
- Is that what you're saying?
- Uh-huh.

418
00:24:04,223 --> 00:24:05,952
Shit, man.

419
00:24:07,426 --> 00:24:08,654
You okay?

420
00:24:09,928 --> 00:24:12,055
I was...

421
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:15,430
You know.

422
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,532
Sorry.

423
00:24:27,946 --> 00:24:29,243
Honey, it's me.

424
00:24:29,314 --> 00:24:30,645
You there?

425
00:24:30,716 --> 00:24:32,650
Pick up.

426
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,247
Okay. Well, we got held up a little bit,

427
00:24:36,321 --> 00:24:39,290
but we'll be rolling in
in about two hours or so.

428
00:24:46,365 --> 00:24:48,333
Is that the Mississippi?

429
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,765
That's it.

430
00:24:51,737 --> 00:24:54,706
I always wanted to go
on one of those riverboats.

431
00:24:54,773 --> 00:24:57,367
You know?
Do you think maybe we could stop?

432
00:24:57,442 --> 00:24:58,773
No.

433
00:25:26,138 --> 00:25:27,435
Pat!

434
00:25:30,843 --> 00:25:32,071
Pat!

435
00:25:40,552 --> 00:25:43,282
Honey! I'm home!

436
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:48,849
Honey?

437
00:25:52,231 --> 00:25:54,062
Sure you got the right house?

438
00:25:54,132 --> 00:25:56,430
Yeah.

439
00:25:56,501 --> 00:25:58,867
Can't believe your own dog
doesn't know you.

440
00:25:58,937 --> 00:26:01,462
We don't have a dog.

441
00:26:13,218 --> 00:26:14,810
Yes, sir.

442
00:26:14,887 --> 00:26:18,379
You have a good life here, Cheaver.

443
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:33,296
There you are.

444
00:26:37,209 --> 00:26:38,369
Fred.

445
00:26:40,245 --> 00:26:41,371
You're home.

446
00:26:48,587 --> 00:26:50,054
I missed you.

447
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:55,151
God, I missed you.

448
00:26:57,863 --> 00:26:59,194
Let me get the dog to stop.

449
00:27:01,433 --> 00:27:02,695
Whose dog is that?

450
00:27:03,702 --> 00:27:05,192
Mine.

451
00:27:07,339 --> 00:27:08,499
No, no, no.

452
00:27:08,573 --> 00:27:10,973
Pogo, you come with me.
Yes. You come with me.

453
00:27:11,043 --> 00:27:12,670
Yes. Yes. Yes.

454
00:27:12,744 --> 00:27:14,803
I'm gonna put you in here for a while.

455
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,075
Yes, I know. I'm sorry.

456
00:27:17,149 --> 00:27:18,548
Mommy loves you.

457
00:27:22,955 --> 00:27:23,944
So.

458
00:27:26,892 --> 00:27:28,382
Where you been all my life?

459
00:27:29,761 --> 00:27:31,558
How's your back?

460
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:34,064
It's fine.

461
00:27:34,132 --> 00:27:35,997
Doesn't matter now.

462
00:27:36,068 --> 00:27:37,592
Scott spent the night at Brad's house.

463
00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:39,899
He should be back soon.

464
00:27:39,972 --> 00:27:41,166
Great.

465
00:27:42,341 --> 00:27:44,070
Where are your friends?

466
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,937
They're out back.

467
00:27:48,313 --> 00:27:49,712
Don't you think we should get them?

468
00:27:49,781 --> 00:27:51,009
Well, sure. Yeah.

469
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:52,641
- Let 'em in.
- Okay.

470
00:27:57,389 --> 00:27:58,651
Welcome.

471
00:28:02,761 --> 00:28:04,729
Can I get you something to drink?

472
00:28:04,796 --> 00:28:06,127
Yeah.

473
00:28:07,532 --> 00:28:08,999
Do you want one, Fred?

474
00:28:09,067 --> 00:28:10,898
No. Thanks.

475
00:28:13,672 --> 00:28:15,936
Well, I bet you're all glad to be back.

476
00:28:16,008 --> 00:28:17,703
- Yeah.
- Oh, yes, ma'am.

477
00:28:19,478 --> 00:28:21,173
Excuse me for a minute.

478
00:28:30,022 --> 00:28:31,580
Sit down.

479
00:28:43,869 --> 00:28:45,268
So.

480
00:28:45,337 --> 00:28:47,134
How are you?

481
00:28:47,205 --> 00:28:49,400
Fine.

482
00:28:49,474 --> 00:28:52,136
Are you sure?

483
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:53,142
Is anything wrong?

484
00:28:53,211 --> 00:28:55,202
No. Nothing.

485
00:28:56,882 --> 00:28:58,747
Something's wrong.

486
00:28:58,817 --> 00:29:00,444
I don't see you

487
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:04,250
for almost two years, and then...

488
00:29:06,324 --> 00:29:07,256
I don't know.

489
00:29:07,325 --> 00:29:09,384
Well...

490
00:29:09,461 --> 00:29:11,053
I don't know, either.

491
00:29:13,231 --> 00:29:17,964
Well, I guess they say that...

492
00:29:18,036 --> 00:29:21,096
you know, that...

493
00:29:21,173 --> 00:29:23,607
it's difficult at first, and...

494
00:29:23,675 --> 00:29:25,973
I'm sorry. I jus... I really am.

495
00:29:26,044 --> 00:29:27,306
I just can't do this.

496
00:29:27,379 --> 00:29:30,473
Everyone told me to wait,
but I don't see the point.

497
00:29:31,783 --> 00:29:33,683
You know me.
I'm no good at pretending.

498
00:29:34,686 --> 00:29:35,812
Pretending about what?

499
00:29:37,089 --> 00:29:38,647
Fred, you're not gonna like this.

500
00:29:39,658 --> 00:29:40,682
Okay.

501
00:29:41,993 --> 00:29:43,290
Okay.

502
00:29:46,898 --> 00:29:48,525
I think I w...

503
00:29:50,368 --> 00:29:52,165
I need a divorce.

504
00:29:53,238 --> 00:29:54,170
What?

505
00:29:54,239 --> 00:29:55,866
I'm sorry.

506
00:29:55,941 --> 00:29:58,910
But to go around pretending
for a week that it's not true,

507
00:29:58,977 --> 00:30:00,569
well, that didn't seem fair to you, either.

508
00:30:00,645 --> 00:30:03,136
Wait a minute...

509
00:30:03,215 --> 00:30:05,877
I come home, and...

510
00:30:09,621 --> 00:30:11,748
Why do...
Why do you want a divorce?

511
00:30:11,823 --> 00:30:14,223
I didn't plan it this way.

512
00:30:14,292 --> 00:30:16,419
It just happened. You were gone.

513
00:30:16,495 --> 00:30:19,464
I'm sorry, but I've moved on.

514
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,027
You gotta be kidding.

515
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,398
I got a new job, and I'm finally happy.

516
00:30:25,403 --> 00:30:26,768
Finally happy? What...

517
00:30:26,838 --> 00:30:28,738
You mean you weren't...
you weren't happy before?

518
00:30:28,807 --> 00:30:30,672
Well, I guess I was. I don't know.

519
00:30:30,742 --> 00:30:32,300
L... I...

520
00:30:36,114 --> 00:30:37,581
You seeing someone else?

521
00:30:37,649 --> 00:30:40,413
- No.
- You can tell me.

522
00:30:40,485 --> 00:30:42,476
I'm not seeing anyone else.

523
00:30:42,554 --> 00:30:44,215
I don't want to see anyone else.

524
00:30:44,289 --> 00:30:46,416
I'm happy being alone.

525
00:30:46,491 --> 00:30:48,857
I want to be alone.

526
00:30:48,927 --> 00:30:52,226
I know that sounds harsh,
but it's the truth.

527
00:30:52,297 --> 00:30:54,265
I am happy.

528
00:30:56,501 --> 00:30:58,401
Without you.

529
00:30:59,504 --> 00:31:01,938
Oh, my God.

530
00:31:02,007 --> 00:31:04,271
This is what makes a guy flip out.

531
00:31:05,744 --> 00:31:06,938
He's gonna strangle her.

532
00:31:07,012 --> 00:31:09,446
If it were you,
you wouldn't strangle her.

533
00:31:09,514 --> 00:31:11,345
Okay.

534
00:31:11,416 --> 00:31:14,044
Shoot her. Whatever.

535
00:31:21,593 --> 00:31:22,617
Hey.

536
00:31:22,694 --> 00:31:24,252
- What's up?
- Hi.

537
00:31:24,329 --> 00:31:26,297
Who are you?

538
00:31:26,364 --> 00:31:28,298
Friends of your dad.

539
00:31:28,366 --> 00:31:30,266
My dad?

540
00:31:30,335 --> 00:31:31,859
- He's...
- Scott.

541
00:31:33,838 --> 00:31:36,068
Dad!

542
00:31:36,141 --> 00:31:39,076
It's good to see you.

543
00:31:42,514 --> 00:31:45,005
Wow! Look at you.

544
00:31:48,887 --> 00:31:50,582
How are you?

545
00:31:50,655 --> 00:31:52,816
I'm good.

546
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:55,758
How are you?

547
00:31:57,462 --> 00:31:59,259
Just great.

548
00:31:59,331 --> 00:32:00,628
So.

549
00:32:00,699 --> 00:32:02,360
Did Mom tell you?

550
00:32:03,435 --> 00:32:05,266
Yeah.

551
00:32:05,337 --> 00:32:06,463
You surprised?

552
00:32:08,573 --> 00:32:09,767
Yeah.

553
00:32:11,543 --> 00:32:13,704
Can you believe it?

554
00:32:13,778 --> 00:32:15,803
Stanford.

555
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,745
- What?
- I got into Stanford.

556
00:32:17,816 --> 00:32:18,908
What?

557
00:32:18,984 --> 00:32:20,076
Yeah, I got in!

558
00:32:20,151 --> 00:32:21,448
You got into...

559
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:22,508
I got into Stanford.

560
00:32:22,587 --> 00:32:23,952
Oh, yeah!

561
00:32:24,022 --> 00:32:26,320
Oh, my... Yes! All right!

562
00:32:26,391 --> 00:32:27,790
- I did it.
- I knew you could do it!

563
00:32:27,859 --> 00:32:30,123
Yeah, and I got a scholarship
that'll pay for half the tuition.

564
00:32:30,195 --> 00:32:32,493
- Fantastic.
- And I made six grand working this year.

565
00:32:32,564 --> 00:32:35,727
- Excellent.
- And I need $20,000 to pay for the rest.

566
00:32:36,901 --> 00:32:38,630
That's not so great.

567
00:32:38,703 --> 00:32:41,729
Well, I told him I'm not sure
we can come up with the $20,000.

568
00:32:43,808 --> 00:32:46,003
It's doable.

569
00:32:46,077 --> 00:32:48,910
I'll just get my old job back,
and if we have to,

570
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,845
we'll take a second mortgage
on the house.

571
00:32:50,915 --> 00:32:52,678
We have a second mortgage already.

572
00:32:52,751 --> 00:32:56,881
Well, then we'll sell
the fucking house, all right?

573
00:32:56,955 --> 00:33:00,516
Okay. Well, it took the Schneiders
two years to sell theirs.

574
00:33:00,592 --> 00:33:03,686
I need the money in three weeks
or I lose my place.

575
00:33:03,762 --> 00:33:05,855
I'll get you the money.

576
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:07,090
I promise.

577
00:33:10,568 --> 00:33:12,331
Can I talk to you?

578
00:33:15,106 --> 00:33:17,802
What are we doing here?
We should be focused on Scott.

579
00:33:17,876 --> 00:33:18,900
I am focused on Scott.

580
00:33:18,977 --> 00:33:22,105
We gotta make sure we can do this for him,
pool our resources, whatever it takes.

581
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:25,741
Why do you need a divorce right now?
I just don't get it.

582
00:33:25,817 --> 00:33:27,182
I'm sorry, Fred.

583
00:33:27,252 --> 00:33:29,083
But this is what I want to do.

584
00:33:29,154 --> 00:33:30,644
Now, I've had some papers drawn up,

585
00:33:30,722 --> 00:33:34,488
and I just want to stick to the plan.

586
00:33:47,305 --> 00:33:49,535
Listen. We're gonna keep it together.

587
00:33:49,607 --> 00:33:51,404
We're gonna stay calm.

588
00:33:51,476 --> 00:33:55,173
Look, there's no killing yourself
or anyone else, okay?

589
00:33:55,246 --> 00:33:56,508
Hey, you're gonna get through this.

590
00:33:56,581 --> 00:33:57,605
All right? Do you hear me?

591
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,618
This is fine right here.

592
00:34:10,695 --> 00:34:12,253
Here you go.

593
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:13,422
Cheaver.

594
00:34:14,933 --> 00:34:16,525
Cheaver.

595
00:34:16,601 --> 00:34:18,865
Come on, what's your plan?

596
00:34:18,937 --> 00:34:21,269
I'll take you guys to the airport

597
00:34:21,339 --> 00:34:23,432
and then I'm gonna drive
straight to Salt Lake,

598
00:34:23,508 --> 00:34:24,497
see my brother.

599
00:34:26,511 --> 00:34:28,069
I'm not going back home.

600
00:34:28,146 --> 00:34:29,477
I can tell you that much.

601
00:34:29,547 --> 00:34:31,412
What about your kid?

602
00:34:31,483 --> 00:34:34,782
I'll figure something out.

603
00:34:34,853 --> 00:34:36,548
Your brother should lend you the money.

604
00:34:36,621 --> 00:34:39,988
My brother is in Debtors Anonymous.

605
00:34:41,025 --> 00:34:42,287
Fred?

606
00:34:43,795 --> 00:34:45,786
I thought that was you.
You're back.

607
00:34:45,864 --> 00:34:46,796
Hey, Carl.

608
00:34:46,865 --> 00:34:48,059
- Hi.
- What's up?

609
00:34:48,133 --> 00:34:49,100
How'd it go over there?

610
00:34:49,167 --> 00:34:50,759
Great.

611
00:34:50,835 --> 00:34:52,166
You know, it went great.

612
00:34:52,237 --> 00:34:53,534
Well, we all missed you...

613
00:34:53,605 --> 00:34:54,799
you know, seeing you every day.

614
00:34:55,807 --> 00:34:56,899
Well, I'm coming back.

615
00:34:56,975 --> 00:34:58,499
I'm just gonna take a few days off,

616
00:34:58,576 --> 00:35:00,635
and then it's nose-to-the-grindstone time.

617
00:35:00,712 --> 00:35:02,646
I gotta earn some money.

618
00:35:02,714 --> 00:35:03,772
Yeah.

619
00:35:03,848 --> 00:35:06,749
But, you know,
since Alan's been in charge,

620
00:35:06,818 --> 00:35:08,752
he's just been running
the company into the ground,

621
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,981
and then that lawsuit...
you heard about that.

622
00:35:11,055 --> 00:35:12,522
No.

623
00:35:13,525 --> 00:35:16,392
Already laid off 60 guys, including me.

624
00:35:17,929 --> 00:35:19,920
Shit.

625
00:35:19,998 --> 00:35:22,330
They're shutting down
the whole place next month, so...

626
00:35:23,334 --> 00:35:24,323
Fuck.

627
00:35:25,904 --> 00:35:27,838
Yeah.

628
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:33,870
Fuck!

629
00:35:33,945 --> 00:35:35,674
- Hey!
- Fuck!

630
00:35:35,747 --> 00:35:36,941
Oh, my goodness.

631
00:35:37,015 --> 00:35:38,277
Fuck!

632
00:35:38,349 --> 00:35:39,907
Okay, there's no need for that.

633
00:35:45,757 --> 00:35:47,281
Take good care of yourself.

634
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:48,985
Don't drive straight through, okay?

635
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,186
You'll get into a wreck.

636
00:35:50,261 --> 00:35:52,195
Not a bad idea.

637
00:35:52,263 --> 00:35:53,525
What?

638
00:35:53,598 --> 00:35:55,566
Catch a telephone pole going 90.

639
00:35:56,668 --> 00:35:58,135
Collect some life insurance money.

640
00:35:58,203 --> 00:35:59,192
No, no, no.

641
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:00,498
No, no. Forget that.

642
00:36:00,572 --> 00:36:02,130
'Cause insurance doesn't pay for suicide.

643
00:36:02,207 --> 00:36:04,505
Yeah. Not if it's an accident.

644
00:36:04,576 --> 00:36:07,340
- Enough with the crazy talk, please.
- Yeah.

645
00:36:07,412 --> 00:36:08,640
- You're not being serious...
- I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

646
00:36:08,713 --> 00:36:10,271
- Okay, good. Good.
- It's just a joke.

647
00:36:10,348 --> 00:36:11,872
Yeah, have a nice flight.

648
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:14,384
And good luck to you.

649
00:36:14,452 --> 00:36:16,511
- All right.
- Drive safe.

650
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:54,515
- You're on the wrong side, pal.
- Yeah, I know.

651
00:36:54,592 --> 00:36:56,958
You know what?
It's all right, 'cause I'm driving anyway.

652
00:36:57,028 --> 00:36:59,258
What?

653
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:00,524
We're coming with you.

654
00:37:00,598 --> 00:37:02,088
- No, you're not.
- Yep.

655
00:37:02,166 --> 00:37:03,258
Of course we are.

656
00:37:03,334 --> 00:37:04,631
- No, you're not. You got a...
- Yes.

657
00:37:04,702 --> 00:37:06,169
You have a flight to catch.

658
00:37:06,237 --> 00:37:08,102
We'll fly out of Salt Lake City.

659
00:37:08,172 --> 00:37:09,696
I feel pathetic enough, all right?

660
00:37:09,774 --> 00:37:12,072
Crying don't mean you're pathetic, okay?

661
00:37:12,143 --> 00:37:14,043
I'm fine.

662
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:15,079
Yeah, you're great.

663
00:37:15,146 --> 00:37:16,443
That's why we're coming with you.

664
00:37:16,514 --> 00:37:18,846
We want to meet your whole family.

665
00:37:28,359 --> 00:37:29,621
This is what you gotta do.

666
00:37:29,694 --> 00:37:33,926
Okay, Cheaver, you gotta get
your finances in order.

667
00:37:33,998 --> 00:37:35,522
All right, you buy a house,

668
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,591
you gotta have an exit plan.

669
00:37:37,669 --> 00:37:39,330
You gotta know how
you're gonna sell it.

670
00:37:40,705 --> 00:37:42,297
You're right.

671
00:37:42,373 --> 00:37:44,841
Hey, easy there, cowboy.

672
00:37:46,711 --> 00:37:48,201
It's for my back.

673
00:37:49,881 --> 00:37:51,075
So what you gotta do

674
00:37:51,149 --> 00:37:54,016
is buy an apartment house, rent it out,

675
00:37:54,085 --> 00:37:55,484
live in the basement for free.

676
00:37:55,553 --> 00:37:58,488
Six months later, you borrow on it
and buy another one.

677
00:38:00,758 --> 00:38:02,623
Am I still living in the basement?

678
00:38:02,694 --> 00:38:04,025
Absolutely.

679
00:38:05,029 --> 00:38:06,155
Take a left.

680
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,959
You can get around this.

681
00:38:12,437 --> 00:38:13,836
Yeah, a man's gotta be indispensable.

682
00:38:13,905 --> 00:38:16,931
You want to move up in the world,
you gotta have skills.

683
00:38:17,008 --> 00:38:18,407
Basic skills.

684
00:38:18,476 --> 00:38:19,909
Yeah, what are your skills?

685
00:38:19,978 --> 00:38:21,502
Leadership.

686
00:38:21,579 --> 00:38:23,171
I'm a leader.

687
00:38:23,247 --> 00:38:24,714
Me, too.

688
00:38:24,782 --> 00:38:26,374
No, you're a private.

689
00:38:26,451 --> 00:38:28,817
That's the opposite of a leader.

690
00:38:28,886 --> 00:38:30,353
You know computer?

691
00:38:30,421 --> 00:38:31,979
Yeah, kinda.

692
00:38:32,056 --> 00:38:35,457
You're at a disadvantage
if you don't master computer skills.

693
00:38:36,761 --> 00:38:40,356
You gotta build on that.

694
00:38:40,431 --> 00:38:42,399
Learn a new word every day, and...

695
00:38:42,467 --> 00:38:44,162
get comfortable with it.

696
00:38:46,938 --> 00:38:49,270
Do you know where you're going here?

697
00:38:50,475 --> 00:38:52,340
I got a sense of it.

698
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:54,844
I think you might be making your way
around to the east.

699
00:38:55,847 --> 00:38:57,337
No. I'm good.

700
00:38:57,415 --> 00:38:58,882
Cheaver, we going the right wa...

701
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,883
Do you think he's okay?

702
00:39:03,955 --> 00:39:06,389
He took a ton of those pills.

703
00:39:08,593 --> 00:39:09,617
Cheaver!

704
00:39:11,629 --> 00:39:12,823
Wake up, man!

705
00:39:14,298 --> 00:39:15,595
Cheaver!

706
00:39:18,302 --> 00:39:20,827
Come on, man! Wake up!

707
00:39:20,905 --> 00:39:22,736
T.K., watch it!

708
00:39:29,147 --> 00:39:30,739
Oh, my God.

709
00:39:30,815 --> 00:39:32,214
Holy shit!

710
00:39:34,919 --> 00:39:36,887
Oh, my God.

711
00:39:36,954 --> 00:39:38,251
Are you all right?

712
00:39:41,659 --> 00:39:43,422
Yeah.

713
00:39:44,829 --> 00:39:46,729
Oh, my God, T.K., you're so lucky.

714
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:51,597
Yeah, well...

715
00:39:51,669 --> 00:39:53,398
I'm a lucky guy.

716
00:39:57,575 --> 00:40:00,271
What the hell were you doing, T. K?

717
00:40:00,344 --> 00:40:02,141
- He stopped short.
- It was a red light.

718
00:40:02,213 --> 00:40:03,680
It was a red light.

719
00:40:05,516 --> 00:40:06,574
There's nothing I could do.
He stopped...

720
00:40:06,651 --> 00:40:08,619
I can't fucking afford it!

721
00:40:09,687 --> 00:40:11,120
Hey, guys.

722
00:40:13,424 --> 00:40:15,016
I think it opened up.

723
00:40:18,296 --> 00:40:19,854
Come on, keep pressure on it.

724
00:40:23,634 --> 00:40:26,364
They said a left at Templeton.

725
00:40:26,437 --> 00:40:28,234
Did you see Templeton?

726
00:40:31,843 --> 00:40:33,435
There it is.

727
00:40:38,516 --> 00:40:40,006
What the hell?

728
00:40:41,552 --> 00:40:43,452
We need a doctor.

729
00:40:43,521 --> 00:40:45,546
Well, the doctor isn't in till 3:00,

730
00:40:45,623 --> 00:40:46,920
so you're gonna have to wait.

731
00:40:46,991 --> 00:40:48,856
Oh, it can't wait.
Is there a nurse?

732
00:40:48,926 --> 00:40:50,154
No.

733
00:40:50,228 --> 00:40:51,160
You know what?

734
00:40:51,229 --> 00:40:52,161
I'm gonna treat her myself.

735
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:53,162
What do you mean?

736
00:40:53,231 --> 00:40:54,994
I'm a doctor. An Army medic.

737
00:40:55,066 --> 00:40:56,966
You can't just go in there!

738
00:40:58,035 --> 00:40:59,263
You have to wait!

739
00:41:06,244 --> 00:41:08,405
Yikes.

740
00:41:08,479 --> 00:41:10,606
Here, you're gonna
have to take off your pants.

741
00:41:10,681 --> 00:41:12,205
Yeah.

742
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:21,090
- Does that hurt?
- It's okay.

743
00:41:28,733 --> 00:41:30,894
Have you ever done this before?

744
00:41:32,236 --> 00:41:34,204
No.

745
00:41:34,272 --> 00:41:38,106
But sometimes you gotta put things out

746
00:41:38,176 --> 00:41:39,837
just to get things done, you know?

747
00:41:41,445 --> 00:41:43,003
Mm-hmm.

748
00:41:44,015 --> 00:41:44,982
You're gonna be fine.

749
00:41:51,122 --> 00:41:52,350
Hey, thanks.

750
00:41:52,423 --> 00:41:53,788
No problem.

751
00:41:58,462 --> 00:42:01,056
Hey, you mind if I use your phone?

752
00:42:06,737 --> 00:42:07,669
Hey, babe.

753
00:42:07,738 --> 00:42:08,762
Sorry I missed you,

754
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,172
and I do miss you,

755
00:42:11,242 --> 00:42:16,771
but I'm gonna be
another day or two, so...

756
00:42:16,848 --> 00:42:17,872
I love you. Okay.

757
00:42:17,949 --> 00:42:19,507
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

758
00:42:29,026 --> 00:42:31,426
How you doing, Cheaver?

759
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:34,422
I'm okay.

760
00:42:34,498 --> 00:42:36,523
Yeah, you gotta give us those pills.

761
00:42:36,601 --> 00:42:37,932
We're not gonna let you off yourself.

762
00:42:41,672 --> 00:42:44,505
If you kill yourself, Cheaver,
do you know where you go?

763
00:42:48,379 --> 00:42:49,368
Hell?

764
00:42:50,681 --> 00:42:51,943
Worse.

765
00:42:52,016 --> 00:42:53,643
The Lake of Fire.

766
00:42:53,718 --> 00:42:54,650
Lake of Fire?

767
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:55,651
Yeah.

768
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,051
You don't want to go there.

769
00:42:59,857 --> 00:43:01,347
I feel like I'm in it.

770
00:43:03,261 --> 00:43:05,195
Hello.

771
00:43:05,263 --> 00:43:06,321
Theodore?

772
00:43:06,397 --> 00:43:07,887
Yeah.

773
00:43:07,965 --> 00:43:09,899
I think it's your girlfriend.

774
00:43:09,967 --> 00:43:12,527
Hey, baby. How are you?

775
00:43:14,205 --> 00:43:15,229
No. No.

776
00:43:15,306 --> 00:43:16,864
No, the other guy got shot in the leg.

777
00:43:16,941 --> 00:43:19,409
He's the one whose wife left him,
so we're driving him to Salt Lake City,

778
00:43:19,477 --> 00:43:21,468
and then I'm going right home.
Okay, babe?

779
00:43:23,881 --> 00:43:25,280
No, I'm with two guys.

780
00:43:27,151 --> 00:43:28,311
All right. Well, let...

781
00:43:28,386 --> 00:43:31,287
Let me call you back, okay?

782
00:43:31,355 --> 00:43:33,186
I love you, too, baby.

783
00:43:33,257 --> 00:43:35,487
Okay. All right. Bye.

784
00:43:37,862 --> 00:43:41,229
Oh, my Lord. You're one good liar.

785
00:43:41,299 --> 00:43:43,631
You know that?

786
00:43:43,701 --> 00:43:45,532
But just so you know,
that's not a good thing.

787
00:43:45,603 --> 00:43:47,298
That just makes you a big phony.

788
00:43:47,371 --> 00:43:48,998
Well, most of what I said was true.

789
00:43:49,073 --> 00:43:52,042
Except you forgot the part
about the tittie bars.

790
00:43:52,109 --> 00:43:53,736
That's 'cause I'm not going
to a tittie bar.

791
00:43:54,779 --> 00:43:57,714
Seems to me if you can't tell
your soul mate the truth,

792
00:43:57,782 --> 00:43:59,841
then maybe she's not
really your soul mate.

793
00:43:59,917 --> 00:44:02,511
I didn't say she was my soul mate.

794
00:44:02,586 --> 00:44:04,884
If Randy lied to me...

795
00:44:08,526 --> 00:44:09,618
I'd take that guitar,

796
00:44:09,694 --> 00:44:12,891
and I would bust it over his head
and the damn lap dancers, too.

797
00:44:12,964 --> 00:44:14,556
There's no lap dancer!

798
00:44:15,566 --> 00:44:17,534
Okay, so tell her the truth.

799
00:44:17,601 --> 00:44:19,501
Why can't you just tell her the truth?

800
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:20,969
Forget it. Just...

801
00:44:21,038 --> 00:44:21,970
I don't get it.

802
00:44:22,039 --> 00:44:23,666
What's the big problem?

803
00:44:23,741 --> 00:44:25,800
- The big problem?
- Yeah.

804
00:44:25,876 --> 00:44:28,003
Is that I got wounded in the dick.
That's the big problem.

805
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:29,239
What?

806
00:44:30,348 --> 00:44:31,474
But I thought you said...

807
00:44:31,549 --> 00:44:33,107
Yeah, and it doesn't work.

808
00:44:33,184 --> 00:44:35,675
I can't get it up.
Okay? You happy?

809
00:44:35,753 --> 00:44:37,550
No.

810
00:44:38,689 --> 00:44:39,917
Why are you going to Vegas?

811
00:44:39,991 --> 00:44:43,188
I got the name of a place in Vegas
where they got real pros,

812
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:45,194
and I'm gonna see if they can get me hard.

813
00:44:45,262 --> 00:44:46,490
Hookers?

814
00:44:46,564 --> 00:44:48,691
No. High-end girls who know
how to handle special cases.

815
00:44:49,867 --> 00:44:51,198
Why don't you let your fiancée do it?

816
00:44:51,268 --> 00:44:53,236
Because she doesn't know
where I'm wounded.

817
00:44:53,304 --> 00:44:56,034
She's not gonna be interested
if she knows I'm not working right.

818
00:44:56,107 --> 00:44:58,075
- No. You don't know that.
- Yeah, I do know that.

819
00:44:58,142 --> 00:44:59,507
You gotta give her a chance.

820
00:44:59,577 --> 00:45:02,808
If it's not working,
she and I got nothing to talk about.

821
00:45:04,982 --> 00:45:06,244
Well...

822
00:45:06,317 --> 00:45:09,411
even if it doesn't work,
you can still pleasure her.

823
00:45:09,487 --> 00:45:10,419
That's true.

824
00:45:10,488 --> 00:45:13,582
Yep. He can do threesomes.

825
00:45:13,657 --> 00:45:14,783
With another girl.

826
00:45:14,859 --> 00:45:16,019
No, another guy.

827
00:45:16,093 --> 00:45:20,325
The guy does it with T.K.'s fiancée
while T.K. Watches.

828
00:45:20,398 --> 00:45:21,797
- Just...
- Colee...

829
00:45:21,866 --> 00:45:24,164
Or you can use a vibrator.

830
00:45:24,235 --> 00:45:26,795
They make 'em real lifelike these days.

831
00:45:26,871 --> 00:45:28,702
You can even strap it on,

832
00:45:28,773 --> 00:45:31,264
or, you know, they can put
this thing inside your penis.

833
00:45:31,342 --> 00:45:36,075
It's like a balloon, and all you gotta do
is just pump it, pump it up.

834
00:45:36,147 --> 00:45:37,079
- Colee?
- Yeah?

835
00:45:37,148 --> 00:45:38,342
Enough.

836
00:45:38,416 --> 00:45:41,214
Well, it's just about
how much you love her.

837
00:45:49,827 --> 00:45:51,886
Rent-a-car folks gave me
the go-ahead, so I can do it.

838
00:45:51,962 --> 00:45:54,396
But there are about five jobs ahead of you.

839
00:45:54,465 --> 00:45:56,490
- Shit.
- All right.

840
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:29,959
So, what are you doing after Vegas?

841
00:46:30,034 --> 00:46:31,626
Gonna go see your mom or...

842
00:46:31,702 --> 00:46:33,670
I haven't spoke to my mom
in three years.

843
00:46:33,737 --> 00:46:35,068
No?

844
00:46:37,108 --> 00:46:38,302
Why not?

845
00:46:38,375 --> 00:46:40,707
She kicked me out
of the house when I was 16.

846
00:46:40,778 --> 00:46:43,246
Wanted to spend more alone time
with her boyfriend.

847
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:50,549
The only people
I really want to talk to now

848
00:46:50,621 --> 00:46:52,680
are Randy's family.

849
00:46:52,756 --> 00:46:55,281
I'm gonna stay with them from now on.

850
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:59,090
Well, you can use my phone,
tell them we're running late.

851
00:46:59,163 --> 00:47:00,960
No, that's okay.

852
00:47:01,031 --> 00:47:02,896
They don't even know I'm coming.

853
00:47:06,237 --> 00:47:07,261
They don't?

854
00:47:07,338 --> 00:47:09,169
Nope.

855
00:47:18,315 --> 00:47:21,148
You know that family
Colee's bringing the guitar to?

856
00:47:25,289 --> 00:47:27,450
She thinks she's gonna live with them.

857
00:47:27,525 --> 00:47:29,390
They're gonna be her family.

858
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:33,157
That girl's living in a dream world.

859
00:47:35,533 --> 00:47:37,398
Plus she's got no skills.

860
00:48:01,792 --> 00:48:03,350
Thanks.

861
00:48:05,262 --> 00:48:07,162
Looks good.

862
00:48:07,231 --> 00:48:09,495
Where's Colee?

863
00:48:09,567 --> 00:48:10,625
I don't know.

864
00:48:10,701 --> 00:48:12,635
- That girl you were with?
- Yeah.

865
00:48:12,703 --> 00:48:14,864
I think she went across
the street to the church.

866
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:34,789
Can I help you?

867
00:48:34,858 --> 00:48:37,691
We're just looking for someone.

868
00:48:37,761 --> 00:48:39,524
Are you friends of Colee?

869
00:48:39,597 --> 00:48:41,827
- Yeah.
- She told me to look out for you.

870
00:48:41,899 --> 00:48:43,526
Just come this way.

871
00:48:49,273 --> 00:48:52,765
He stopped me and then he said,
"What do you do?

872
00:48:52,843 --> 00:48:56,506
"What do I do?"
"What business are you in?"

873
00:48:56,580 --> 00:49:00,516
And it's funny 'cause I always say,
"Well, I'm in the love business. "

874
00:49:02,653 --> 00:49:04,518
And don't you know the Lord himself

875
00:49:04,588 --> 00:49:08,615
is chairman of the board
of this love business.

876
00:49:08,692 --> 00:49:10,751
Think about it.

877
00:49:10,828 --> 00:49:13,353
He is, isn't he?

878
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:16,331
And so then, you've got to ask yourself,

879
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,129
don't you want to be
in business with the Lord?

880
00:49:18,202 --> 00:49:20,397
Hey! Come on in.

881
00:49:20,471 --> 00:49:22,234
I know I sure do.

882
00:49:22,306 --> 00:49:23,933
'Cause the Lord takes responsibility

883
00:49:24,008 --> 00:49:25,635
even when you make mistakes,
doesn't he?

884
00:49:25,709 --> 00:49:27,006
He's really good, isn't he?

885
00:49:27,077 --> 00:49:29,841
That's what I call a good C.E.O.

886
00:49:29,913 --> 00:49:33,314
Now, in the spirit of our Lord,
who died for our sins,

887
00:49:33,384 --> 00:49:35,511
let's reach out to each other
with a greeting of peace.

888
00:49:35,586 --> 00:49:39,317
Peace be with you.

889
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:41,585
- We should get out of here.
- Yeah, I know.

890
00:49:41,659 --> 00:49:43,126
Peace be with you.

891
00:49:46,363 --> 00:49:48,695
Now remember the folks behind you, too.

892
00:49:48,766 --> 00:49:51,530
- Don't be shy.
- Peace be with you.

893
00:49:51,602 --> 00:49:52,933
And if any of you are troubled,

894
00:49:53,003 --> 00:49:56,939
I encourage you to speak out.

895
00:49:57,007 --> 00:49:58,838
Testify.

896
00:50:00,944 --> 00:50:03,811
I'm hoping you can pray for us.

897
00:50:03,881 --> 00:50:08,341
We're soldiers home on leave,
and my friends here are troubled.

898
00:50:08,419 --> 00:50:11,115
Cheaver has a very bad back
and a broken marriage

899
00:50:11,188 --> 00:50:13,884
and he wants to take his own life.

900
00:50:13,957 --> 00:50:16,118
And T.K.'s wounded
in the private parts,

901
00:50:16,193 --> 00:50:19,162
which is why he's lying to his fiancée
about going to whores.

902
00:50:23,334 --> 00:50:27,668
Thank you, sister.

903
00:50:27,738 --> 00:50:28,932
Lord, bring your healing touch

904
00:50:29,006 --> 00:50:30,530
to Sister Margaret's arthritis...

905
00:50:32,976 --> 00:50:34,967
and give her daughter strength and faith

906
00:50:35,045 --> 00:50:37,536
in the final days of her pregnancy.

907
00:50:37,614 --> 00:50:38,945
In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

908
00:50:40,918 --> 00:50:42,408
And be sure to say a prayer...

909
00:50:42,486 --> 00:50:43,475
Please stand, sir.

910
00:50:46,657 --> 00:50:47,817
Get up.

911
00:50:47,891 --> 00:50:49,358
It's your turn.

912
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,332
Lord, help these soldiers,

913
00:50:59,403 --> 00:51:02,804
who have given so much for this country.

914
00:51:02,873 --> 00:51:07,003
Ease the burden of pain
from Brother Cheaver's back

915
00:51:07,077 --> 00:51:09,272
and heal his broken spirit.

916
00:51:09,346 --> 00:51:10,643
Amen.

917
00:51:10,714 --> 00:51:12,909
And for Brother T.K., make his wounded...

918
00:51:12,983 --> 00:51:15,611
whole again.

919
00:51:15,686 --> 00:51:17,620
Amen.

920
00:51:23,093 --> 00:51:25,152
You soldiers from Kansas City?

921
00:51:25,229 --> 00:51:26,992
No, sir.
We're just passing through.

922
00:51:27,064 --> 00:51:28,691
Well, I hope you're hungry.

923
00:51:28,766 --> 00:51:30,597
We're having quite a shindig tonight.

924
00:51:30,667 --> 00:51:31,998
Happens to be my birthday.

925
00:51:32,069 --> 00:51:33,400
Happy Birthday.

926
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:34,869
That's very nice of you but...

927
00:51:34,938 --> 00:51:38,430
I'm Stan Tilson, and you don't need
to be polite about it.

928
00:51:38,509 --> 00:51:41,444
I want you folks to come and that's it.

929
00:51:45,449 --> 00:51:48,009
We don't have time for this.

930
00:51:48,085 --> 00:51:51,452
Well, you can't say no
to that kind of invitation.

931
00:51:51,522 --> 00:51:53,319
Half of healing is fellowship.

932
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:56,223
We'll have a quick bite
and be on our way.

933
00:52:04,468 --> 00:52:07,164
Ah, welcome, welcome.

934
00:52:07,237 --> 00:52:08,761
Now, we don't start for a little while,

935
00:52:08,839 --> 00:52:11,501
but you folks make yourselves
right at home.

936
00:52:11,575 --> 00:52:15,978
What are those?

937
00:52:16,046 --> 00:52:17,570
Lobster.

938
00:52:19,349 --> 00:52:20,976
Big lobster.

939
00:52:21,051 --> 00:52:23,451
- Ask her for umbrellas.
- How many chairs do we need?

940
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:27,047
I've got five set up here,
so I need to get a few more.

941
00:52:27,124 --> 00:52:29,957
Give me a hand right here.

942
00:52:31,028 --> 00:52:34,361
This guy's got some serious dough.

943
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:35,625
Happy Birthday.

944
00:52:39,937 --> 00:52:42,337
Would you care for some stuffed endive?

945
00:52:42,406 --> 00:52:46,536
No, thank you.

946
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:49,443
It really is. The place looks fabulous.

947
00:52:49,513 --> 00:52:52,949
I work for my dad.
I work in commodities.

948
00:52:53,016 --> 00:52:54,040
- Really?
- Yeah.

949
00:52:54,117 --> 00:52:55,914
Cool. Yeah, my dad's a drill instructor.

950
00:52:55,986 --> 00:52:58,181
Yeah, I got a brother stationed in Korea

951
00:52:58,255 --> 00:53:01,588
and another brother
who's in basic training.

952
00:53:01,658 --> 00:53:03,592
So your whole family's in the Army?

953
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:05,992
Yeah. I mean, just about.
You know, my mom's not.

954
00:53:06,063 --> 00:53:08,088
Our whole family is in finance.

955
00:53:08,165 --> 00:53:09,291
- Cool.
- Yeah.

956
00:53:09,366 --> 00:53:11,664
These are the soldiers that Dad invited.

957
00:53:11,735 --> 00:53:12,895
This is my brother Peter.

958
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:14,767
Right. Welcome home.

959
00:53:14,838 --> 00:53:16,430
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

960
00:53:16,507 --> 00:53:18,532
No, thank you.

961
00:53:18,609 --> 00:53:21,305
It's a big mess over there, isn't it?

962
00:53:21,378 --> 00:53:23,039
Well, of course it is. It's a war.

963
00:53:23,113 --> 00:53:24,444
War is messy.

964
00:53:24,515 --> 00:53:26,380
It can't be all perfect.

965
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:27,542
How would you know?

966
00:53:27,618 --> 00:53:28,744
Well, how would you know, Peter?

967
00:53:28,819 --> 00:53:31,117
We don't exactly see you over there.

968
00:53:31,188 --> 00:53:33,884
But I'm not for the war.

969
00:53:33,957 --> 00:53:35,390
I don't think it's a great thing.

970
00:53:35,459 --> 00:53:37,552
Neither do I.

971
00:53:37,628 --> 00:53:38,925
Since when?

972
00:53:38,996 --> 00:53:40,554
I can change my mind, can't I?

973
00:53:40,631 --> 00:53:41,620
Like everybody else.

974
00:53:41,698 --> 00:53:43,928
Yeah, go ahead, change your mind.

975
00:53:44,001 --> 00:53:46,299
But these guys are stuck over there.

976
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:48,804
That's not the point, Peter.
I mean, you don't get it.

977
00:53:48,872 --> 00:53:50,032
You just don't get it.

978
00:53:50,107 --> 00:53:52,371
You can't change your minds, can you?

979
00:53:52,442 --> 00:53:54,842
You can't just leave?

980
00:53:54,912 --> 00:53:56,436
No, not really.

981
00:53:56,513 --> 00:53:58,777
We do get some R&R.

982
00:53:58,849 --> 00:54:01,477
These guys are screwed and for what?

983
00:54:01,552 --> 00:54:02,644
- Guys...
- For what?

984
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:04,584
Can we just argue about golf, please?

985
00:54:04,655 --> 00:54:06,384
There's a lot at stake over there, Peter.

986
00:54:06,456 --> 00:54:07,855
Yeah, a lot of money.

987
00:54:07,925 --> 00:54:09,893
Barbara, what's the name of that woman

988
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,860
who's always trying to get
that Saturday morning tea time?

989
00:54:11,929 --> 00:54:13,726
- Angela Morton.
- Right.

990
00:54:13,797 --> 00:54:15,321
That's her big cause.

991
00:54:15,399 --> 00:54:18,163
What do you really think we're fighting for?

992
00:54:18,235 --> 00:54:21,295
What are you doing over there?

993
00:54:21,371 --> 00:54:23,839
Honestly, we're just trying to stay alive.

994
00:54:23,907 --> 00:54:26,068
Stay alive?

995
00:54:26,143 --> 00:54:27,633
I bet that's not too easy.

996
00:54:27,711 --> 00:54:29,406
Stay alive? Jesus Christ.

997
00:54:29,479 --> 00:54:31,470
If that's your attitude,
no wonder we're losing.

998
00:54:31,548 --> 00:54:32,810
Bob!

999
00:54:32,883 --> 00:54:34,282
Hey, that's nice.

1000
00:54:34,351 --> 00:54:36,376
Well, I don't have to listen to this crap.

1001
00:54:36,453 --> 00:54:37,818
- Come on.
- No, but you just...

1002
00:54:37,888 --> 00:54:39,947
Can't you just shut up for once?

1003
00:54:40,023 --> 00:54:43,186
- What?
- You always do this.

1004
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:44,192
I'm sorry.

1005
00:54:44,261 --> 00:54:45,250
It's okay.

1006
00:54:45,329 --> 00:54:46,261
It's fine.

1007
00:54:46,330 --> 00:54:48,696
Parties are supposed to be fun.

1008
00:54:53,036 --> 00:54:55,766
White wine, please.

1009
00:54:58,141 --> 00:55:00,302
So you're a soldier, huh?

1010
00:55:01,778 --> 00:55:03,302
Used to be.

1011
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:06,008
You saw a lot?

1012
00:55:06,083 --> 00:55:08,017
Enough.

1013
00:55:08,085 --> 00:55:11,919
So they have girls in the military now?

1014
00:55:11,989 --> 00:55:13,616
Yes, ma'am.

1015
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:15,214
Is that your friend?

1016
00:55:16,526 --> 00:55:17,925
The girl I'm with?

1017
00:55:17,995 --> 00:55:20,520
We're sharing a car.

1018
00:55:23,033 --> 00:55:24,227
You married?

1019
00:55:27,904 --> 00:55:31,067
I'm separated.

1020
00:55:31,141 --> 00:55:33,507
You?

1021
00:55:35,078 --> 00:55:37,569
What's that mean?

1022
00:55:39,082 --> 00:55:41,050
It means "mmm. "

1023
00:55:46,823 --> 00:55:48,586
Okay.

1024
00:55:49,626 --> 00:55:52,094
Do you know how to dance?

1025
00:55:52,162 --> 00:55:54,687
As a matter of fact, I do.

1026
00:56:19,456 --> 00:56:21,856
Cheaver's got some skills.

1027
00:56:21,925 --> 00:56:23,415
I think she likes him.

1028
00:56:30,967 --> 00:56:32,662
Do you wanna dance?

1029
00:56:32,736 --> 00:56:34,727
Can you dance?

1030
00:56:36,573 --> 00:56:38,302
Of course I can dance.

1031
00:56:38,375 --> 00:56:40,707
Nah, I meant your leg.

1032
00:56:41,878 --> 00:56:44,676
Oh, yeah.

1033
00:56:44,748 --> 00:56:47,182
I don't know. We could try.

1034
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:49,218
Does it hurt?

1035
00:56:49,286 --> 00:56:51,584
Yeah, a little, I guess.

1036
00:56:51,655 --> 00:56:55,318
I think if you put your foot on mine...

1037
00:56:55,392 --> 00:56:56,882
Put my foot on yours?

1038
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,552
Yeah.

1039
00:56:58,628 --> 00:57:00,391
- Like, on your toes?
- Sure.

1040
00:57:00,464 --> 00:57:02,432
- How's that?
- Yeah.

1041
00:57:02,499 --> 00:57:04,990
- We can try that.
- All right.

1042
00:57:07,237 --> 00:57:09,034
- Yeah, that helps it.
- Does it?

1043
00:57:09,106 --> 00:57:10,596
Okay.

1044
00:57:14,111 --> 00:57:16,841
Wow.

1045
00:57:16,913 --> 00:57:18,005
What?

1046
00:57:21,017 --> 00:57:25,181
You actually know how to be nice.

1047
00:57:52,149 --> 00:57:54,549
Where'd Cheaver go?

1048
00:57:54,618 --> 00:57:55,607
I don't know.

1049
00:57:59,156 --> 00:58:00,680
Cheaver?

1050
00:58:07,197 --> 00:58:08,755
Where the hell is he?

1051
00:58:10,467 --> 00:58:12,526
Maybe he went home with that woman.

1052
00:58:12,602 --> 00:58:14,297
He better not have.

1053
00:58:14,371 --> 00:58:16,965
Oh, come on.
Give the guy a break.

1054
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,098
Cheaver!

1055
00:58:29,653 --> 00:58:30,881
Nah, I don't want to stay here.

1056
00:58:30,954 --> 00:58:34,549
Hey! These people are nice.

1057
00:58:34,624 --> 00:58:36,148
And we gotta sleep sometime.

1058
00:58:36,226 --> 00:58:38,285
Yeah, you could have slept
while I was driving.

1059
00:58:38,361 --> 00:58:39,828
Look, we'll find Cheaver in the morning

1060
00:58:39,896 --> 00:58:42,194
and then we'll get going, okay?

1061
00:58:42,265 --> 00:58:44,392
I think these are the guest rooms.

1062
00:58:44,467 --> 00:58:45,764
I'm gonna take this one.

1063
00:58:45,836 --> 00:58:47,428
- Okay.
- Okay.

1064
00:58:47,504 --> 00:58:48,801
All right.

1065
00:58:52,342 --> 00:58:54,776
- Good night.
- Good night.

1066
00:59:51,334 --> 00:59:52,596
Oh, my...

1067
00:59:52,669 --> 00:59:55,661
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, fuck.

1068
01:00:04,447 --> 01:00:06,210
I think I found Cheaver.

1069
01:00:08,985 --> 01:00:11,078
Oh, yeah.

1070
01:00:25,101 --> 01:00:26,693
I think I'm fixing to come!

1071
01:00:35,045 --> 01:00:36,376
Don't stop.

1072
01:00:36,446 --> 01:00:37,743
Who's that?

1073
01:00:37,814 --> 01:00:39,179
It's just my husband.

1074
01:00:39,249 --> 01:00:40,546
- What?
- Don't stop.

1075
01:00:40,617 --> 01:00:42,107
Keep going.

1076
01:00:42,185 --> 01:00:43,652
Give it to her good, soldier.

1077
01:00:46,423 --> 01:00:47,754
There's someone else in there.

1078
01:01:00,570 --> 01:01:03,164
Cheaver, that woman wanted
to make a train with you.

1079
01:01:04,574 --> 01:01:06,064
Do you still want to kill yourself?

1080
01:01:06,142 --> 01:01:07,939
Not at the moment.

1081
01:01:08,011 --> 01:01:09,069
There's still hope, you know.

1082
01:01:09,145 --> 01:01:10,635
That woman wanted you.

1083
01:01:10,714 --> 01:01:12,147
Yeah, and that man wanted you, too.

1084
01:01:12,215 --> 01:01:13,477
It's not funny.

1085
01:01:15,885 --> 01:01:17,944
"I think I'm fixin' to come!"

1086
01:01:39,809 --> 01:01:43,404
I told this guy in the band
about Randy's guitar,

1087
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:46,005
and he thinks it might
be worth thousands of dollars

1088
01:01:46,082 --> 01:01:48,414
or maybe even more.

1089
01:01:48,485 --> 01:01:51,010
- Great.
- Whatever.

1090
01:02:09,205 --> 01:02:11,673
It'd be nice to go hiking
when we get to the Rockies,

1091
01:02:11,741 --> 01:02:13,333
don't you think?

1092
01:02:13,410 --> 01:02:14,434
Have a picnic.

1093
01:02:14,511 --> 01:02:16,843
No.

1094
01:02:55,151 --> 01:02:58,780
Denver, Colorado.

1095
01:03:12,735 --> 01:03:14,293
Where are we?

1096
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:16,201
What are you doing?

1097
01:03:16,272 --> 01:03:17,762
You'll see.

1098
01:03:37,994 --> 01:03:40,121
It's a good one.

1099
01:03:40,196 --> 01:03:43,188
I know a guy who'd come over here right now
and give you ten grand for it.

1100
01:03:43,266 --> 01:03:44,426
10 grand?

1101
01:03:44,501 --> 01:03:45,763
10 grand.

1102
01:03:45,835 --> 01:03:47,564
But...

1103
01:03:47,637 --> 01:03:52,472
it looks like someone
just got 22 at auction.

1104
01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:57,140
$22,000?

1105
01:03:57,213 --> 01:03:59,613
It's a very special instrument
you've got there.

1106
01:03:59,682 --> 01:04:01,377
Yes, sir.

1107
01:04:05,088 --> 01:04:06,749
Jeez.

1108
01:04:06,823 --> 01:04:10,259
$22,000!

1109
01:04:10,326 --> 01:04:13,159
You didn't believe me.

1110
01:04:13,229 --> 01:04:16,494
No, I thought it was just a stolen guitar.

1111
01:04:16,566 --> 01:04:17,590
It's not stolen.

1112
01:04:17,667 --> 01:04:19,134
It belonged to his daddy.

1113
01:04:19,202 --> 01:04:20,760
But he stole something, right?

1114
01:04:20,837 --> 01:04:22,532
Yeah, he robbed a casino.

1115
01:04:22,605 --> 01:04:24,163
Lucky Jim's.

1116
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:25,434
That's right.

1117
01:04:25,508 --> 01:04:26,770
Walked in there by himself,

1118
01:04:26,843 --> 01:04:28,868
and he walked out with $50,000.

1119
01:04:28,945 --> 01:04:32,847
So Randy was, like, a bad ass, right?

1120
01:04:32,916 --> 01:04:34,144
Yeah.

1121
01:04:34,217 --> 01:04:36,048
He was a good person, too, you know.

1122
01:04:36,119 --> 01:04:37,552
Came from a great family.

1123
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:41,317
- He just robbed a little bit, is that it?
- Hello?

1124
01:04:41,391 --> 01:04:43,951
- Hey, Scott.
- Why'd he start robbing?

1125
01:04:44,027 --> 01:04:46,086
He just got, you know,
into a little bit of trouble.

1126
01:04:46,162 --> 01:04:49,689
Well, your mom and me have...

1127
01:04:49,766 --> 01:04:53,600
some things we have to sort out.

1128
01:04:56,940 --> 01:04:58,840
No, no, it has nothing to do with that.

1129
01:04:58,908 --> 01:05:00,569
You're going to Stanford.

1130
01:05:00,643 --> 01:05:03,544
We're gonna get you to Stanford.

1131
01:05:03,613 --> 01:05:05,945
No.

1132
01:05:06,015 --> 01:05:09,075
No, no, no.
That is not a good idea.

1133
01:05:09,152 --> 01:05:11,620
No. Do not do that.

1134
01:05:11,688 --> 01:05:13,485
I will get you the money.

1135
01:05:13,556 --> 01:05:16,218
I will take care of it.
I said I will and I will.

1136
01:05:16,292 --> 01:05:20,251
Promise me you will not do that.

1137
01:05:22,498 --> 01:05:24,864
All right.

1138
01:05:24,934 --> 01:05:28,768
I'll call you later.

1139
01:05:29,906 --> 01:05:32,466
All right. And...

1140
01:05:32,542 --> 01:05:33,474
I love you.

1141
01:05:33,543 --> 01:05:34,908
Fuck.

1142
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:38,807
So what's up?

1143
01:05:39,983 --> 01:05:43,680
Kid thinks he's got it all figured out.

1144
01:05:43,753 --> 01:05:46,847
He's gonna get the money by enlisting
in the fucking Army.

1145
01:05:46,923 --> 01:05:48,823
$20,000 signing bonus,

1146
01:05:48,891 --> 01:05:50,950
has to put off college
for God knows how many years,

1147
01:05:51,027 --> 01:05:52,517
but he's okay with that.

1148
01:05:53,696 --> 01:05:55,926
Well, that sounds like a pretty good idea.

1149
01:05:55,999 --> 01:05:57,523
That is not a good idea.

1150
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:59,033
They'll send him right over there.

1151
01:05:59,102 --> 01:06:00,330
I'm not gonna let that happen.

1152
01:06:03,473 --> 01:06:04,906
Maybe he could go to a state school.

1153
01:06:04,974 --> 01:06:07,101
No. You got a shot at Stanford,

1154
01:06:07,176 --> 01:06:08,234
you go to Stanford.

1155
01:06:08,311 --> 01:06:09,676
Exactly.

1156
01:06:11,648 --> 01:06:16,915
The problem is you can't
go there for free, you know.

1157
01:06:16,986 --> 01:06:19,648
I gotta get the money.
Get the money.

1158
01:06:19,722 --> 01:06:23,419
I'm gonna just...
I'll get the money.

1159
01:06:27,096 --> 01:06:29,326
I'm worried about you, Cheaver.

1160
01:06:32,235 --> 01:06:33,566
I'll figure something out.

1161
01:06:33,636 --> 01:06:36,935
If you're so worried about him,
why don't you give him that guitar of yours?

1162
01:06:37,006 --> 01:06:40,203
What? I can't give him Randy's guitar.

1163
01:06:40,276 --> 01:06:42,369
Why not? It's a stolen guitar.

1164
01:06:42,445 --> 01:06:43,912
It's not stolen.

1165
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:47,279
It belongs to his family.

1166
01:06:47,350 --> 01:06:49,875
Besides, I mean, I don't see
the problem, you know.

1167
01:06:49,952 --> 01:06:52,512
I enlisted and I went over there.

1168
01:06:52,588 --> 01:06:54,078
Yeah, but what choice did you have?

1169
01:06:54,157 --> 01:06:57,957
And if I was gonna sell the guitar,
don't you think I'd use it

1170
01:06:58,027 --> 01:06:59,619
to pay for my own goddamn college?

1171
01:06:59,696 --> 01:07:01,323
Yeah, but it wouldn't be Stanford.

1172
01:07:01,397 --> 01:07:03,922
You don't know that.

1173
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,696
Come on, the guy's gonna kill himself
if you don't give him that guitar.

1174
01:07:06,769 --> 01:07:09,602
I'm not gonna kill myself,
and I don't need your guitar.

1175
01:07:09,672 --> 01:07:11,333
All right, what are you gonna do then?

1176
01:07:11,407 --> 01:07:12,999
I'm gonna skip Salt Lake,

1177
01:07:13,076 --> 01:07:15,169
I'm gonna go to Vegas with you guys,

1178
01:07:15,244 --> 01:07:17,872
I'm gonna borrow some money
off my credit card,

1179
01:07:17,947 --> 01:07:20,245
and I'm gonna turn it into $20,000.

1180
01:07:20,316 --> 01:07:21,908
Oh, you gonna play poker?

1181
01:07:21,984 --> 01:07:23,849
No, I was thinking roulette.

1182
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,251
You play red and black,

1183
01:07:25,321 --> 01:07:27,881
guess the right color three times,
I got the money.

1184
01:07:27,957 --> 01:07:29,891
If I was you,
I'd stick to the skills games...

1185
01:07:29,959 --> 01:07:31,654
either blackjack or Texas hold 'em.

1186
01:07:31,728 --> 01:07:33,559
But whatever you do,
just stay away from craps.

1187
01:07:33,629 --> 01:07:36,189
That is the stupidest idea.

1188
01:07:36,265 --> 01:07:37,562
Why?

1189
01:07:37,633 --> 01:07:40,033
It's crazy.

1190
01:07:40,103 --> 01:07:42,936
You can't just go to Vegas
and make $20,000.

1191
01:07:43,005 --> 01:07:44,302
That's just... You're dreamin'.

1192
01:07:44,374 --> 01:07:46,239
Wait a minute. He's dreaming?

1193
01:07:46,309 --> 01:07:47,640
Yeah.

1194
01:07:47,710 --> 01:07:49,575
He's the one who's got the stupid idea?

1195
01:07:49,645 --> 01:07:52,705
You're traveling
all the way across country

1196
01:07:52,782 --> 01:07:55,307
to visit a family that you've never even met.

1197
01:07:55,385 --> 01:07:57,649
Like, they don't know you're coming.

1198
01:07:57,720 --> 01:07:59,984
They don't even know you exist.

1199
01:08:00,056 --> 01:08:01,990
You think they're gonna
love you or take care of you?

1200
01:08:02,058 --> 01:08:04,026
Like, he's not the one who's dreaming.

1201
01:08:06,796 --> 01:08:07,728
Christ.

1202
01:08:07,797 --> 01:08:09,822
Are you...

1203
01:08:09,899 --> 01:08:11,332
You gotta be kiddin...

1204
01:08:11,401 --> 01:08:13,392
I don't want him to lose his money.

1205
01:08:13,469 --> 01:08:17,064
Listen. Don't worry about me, okay?

1206
01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:18,573
Don't worry about me.

1207
01:08:18,641 --> 01:08:20,472
I have to give 'em the guitar.

1208
01:08:20,543 --> 01:08:23,444
I have to give it to them.

1209
01:08:23,513 --> 01:08:26,346
- But they don't even know you.
- I don't know you!

1210
01:08:26,416 --> 01:08:30,182
Whoever heard of giving $20,000
to someone that you just met?

1211
01:08:30,253 --> 01:08:33,245
Yeah, but the guy's desperate.
He's all fucked up.

1212
01:08:33,322 --> 01:08:34,482
Enough.

1213
01:08:34,557 --> 01:08:36,024
I can pay for my own kid's college.

1214
01:08:36,092 --> 01:08:37,821
I'm just trying to help you, man.

1215
01:08:37,894 --> 01:08:39,361
You wanna talk about fucked up?

1216
01:08:39,429 --> 01:08:40,862
Look in the mirror.

1217
01:08:43,366 --> 01:08:45,561
I'm not the one trying to kill myself, buddy.

1218
01:09:14,430 --> 01:09:17,194
Colee...

1219
01:09:17,266 --> 01:09:18,563
Colee stop crying.

1220
01:09:18,634 --> 01:09:21,626
I can't give you the guitar.

1221
01:09:21,704 --> 01:09:24,400
I can't give it to you.

1222
01:09:24,474 --> 01:09:26,908
I know. It's okay.

1223
01:09:26,976 --> 01:09:30,173
It's not okay.

1224
01:09:30,246 --> 01:09:33,374
I want to give it to you,
but then I won't have...

1225
01:09:34,617 --> 01:09:37,609
I won't have anywhere to go.

1226
01:09:47,897 --> 01:09:51,094
Colee. Come on, Colee.

1227
01:09:51,167 --> 01:09:52,964
All right, listen.

1228
01:09:53,035 --> 01:09:56,163
How about you stop crying
and we'll stop.

1229
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:58,400
What do you mean?

1230
01:09:58,474 --> 01:10:00,374
You been wanting to sightsee, right?

1231
01:10:01,410 --> 01:10:02,707
Yeah.

1232
01:10:02,778 --> 01:10:05,611
Okay, so we'll go somewhere,
do something.

1233
01:10:07,850 --> 01:10:09,750
Could we have a picnic?

1234
01:10:11,287 --> 01:10:12,481
Yeah, a picnic. Whatever.

1235
01:10:12,555 --> 01:10:13,579
Yeah.

1236
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:46,550
You know, you can leave
your guitar in the car.

1237
01:10:46,622 --> 01:10:48,556
I'm not gonna steal it.

1238
01:10:49,825 --> 01:10:52,293
Well, you might not think you are,

1239
01:10:52,361 --> 01:10:53,953
but I'm not chancing it.

1240
01:10:54,030 --> 01:10:56,260
I don't want to get ditched.

1241
01:10:56,332 --> 01:10:58,323
Why? Does that happen to you a lot?

1242
01:11:02,238 --> 01:11:04,468
Look at these rocks.

1243
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:06,201
That's a skipping rock.

1244
01:11:06,275 --> 01:11:07,606
That would go far, huh?

1245
01:11:07,677 --> 01:11:09,144
Yep.

1246
01:11:09,211 --> 01:11:11,145
Hey, that's a fossil.

1247
01:11:11,213 --> 01:11:12,271
That's a nice one.

1248
01:11:12,348 --> 01:11:14,578
- It is?
- A mollusk. See?

1249
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:20,045
The poor little guy
winds up getting squished

1250
01:11:20,122 --> 01:11:22,181
between two rocks.

1251
01:11:29,131 --> 01:11:31,361
Why do we have to go back?

1252
01:11:33,736 --> 01:11:36,671
I like it here. It's fun.

1253
01:12:11,674 --> 01:12:14,006
Oh, fuck.

1254
01:12:14,076 --> 01:12:16,943
- T.K.
- What?

1255
01:12:17,013 --> 01:12:18,275
Guess what.

1256
01:12:18,347 --> 01:12:19,746
What?

1257
01:12:22,051 --> 01:12:25,043
I got your problem solved.

1258
01:12:25,121 --> 01:12:27,555
What problem?

1259
01:12:27,623 --> 01:12:30,615
I was in the bathroom

1260
01:12:30,693 --> 01:12:33,218
and I met these real nice girls,

1261
01:12:33,295 --> 01:12:35,786
and they travel around
in that RV over there.

1262
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:39,963
And what they do
is they're sex workers.

1263
01:12:40,036 --> 01:12:41,628
But they're real professional.

1264
01:12:41,704 --> 01:12:43,865
And I told them about
your problem and they said...

1265
01:12:43,939 --> 01:12:47,397
- You gotta stop telling people that!
- But they said they could take care of it.

1266
01:12:47,476 --> 01:12:48,841
And they said they'd give you a discount

1267
01:12:48,911 --> 01:12:50,674
'cause you're a serviceman
wounded in the war.

1268
01:12:50,746 --> 01:12:52,179
Sounds like a good deal to me.

1269
01:12:52,248 --> 01:12:54,443
That's what I thought.

1270
01:12:55,451 --> 01:12:57,248
What do you think?

1271
01:13:05,227 --> 01:13:06,592
- Hey, there.
- Hey.

1272
01:13:06,662 --> 01:13:09,392
- Hi.
- So here he is.

1273
01:13:09,465 --> 01:13:10,693
This is T.K.

1274
01:13:10,766 --> 01:13:14,258
T.K., this is Brandi,
Kendra and Savannah.

1275
01:13:14,336 --> 01:13:15,928
- Hey.
- Hey.

1276
01:13:16,005 --> 01:13:17,404
So how does this work?

1277
01:13:17,473 --> 01:13:19,498
Does he just pick one of you or...

1278
01:13:19,575 --> 01:13:21,770
Yep, or he can have all three.

1279
01:13:23,245 --> 01:13:24,303
How much?

1280
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:27,110
He's so cute, I'll do it for free.

1281
01:13:27,183 --> 01:13:28,707
For free?

1282
01:13:28,784 --> 01:13:29,773
How does that sound?

1283
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:33,085
Don't worry. She'll get it going.

1284
01:13:33,155 --> 01:13:34,747
If she can't, nobody can.

1285
01:13:36,492 --> 01:13:38,687
You come with me.

1286
01:13:40,129 --> 01:13:41,221
Okay.

1287
01:13:43,399 --> 01:13:44,525
You're all right?

1288
01:13:48,370 --> 01:13:50,167
We're here for ya.

1289
01:13:57,546 --> 01:13:58,911
- Colee?
- Yeah?

1290
01:13:58,981 --> 01:14:00,346
Come on.

1291
01:14:03,452 --> 01:14:04,919
You all right?

1292
01:14:06,188 --> 01:14:08,122
Yeah.

1293
01:14:09,225 --> 01:14:11,989
- What?
- Colee.

1294
01:14:12,061 --> 01:14:14,529
No good deed goes unpunished.

1295
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:22,531
- What's wrong?
- I got to...

1296
01:14:22,605 --> 01:14:23,572
You getting cold feet?

1297
01:14:23,639 --> 01:14:25,334
No, I gotta get something in my stomach...

1298
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:26,772
What's the problem?

1299
01:14:26,842 --> 01:14:29,276
I haven't eaten anything except a hot dog
in the last 24 hours.

1300
01:14:29,345 --> 01:14:31,006
So what? Eat later.

1301
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:32,741
Well, I need to up my electrolytes.

1302
01:14:32,815 --> 01:14:34,214
You know, I need
a PowerBar or a Gatorade...

1303
01:14:34,283 --> 01:14:35,807
Okay. Do you have anything like that?

1304
01:14:35,885 --> 01:14:39,753
No. We just got Coke and tossed salad

1305
01:14:39,822 --> 01:14:41,517
and Marlboro Lights.

1306
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:43,581
Hey, T.K., I saw a store on the way in.

1307
01:14:43,659 --> 01:14:45,559
All right, well...

1308
01:14:45,628 --> 01:14:48,961
I guess they're gonna go to the store.

1309
01:14:50,866 --> 01:14:53,733
Get me a fried egg sandwich on a roll!

1310
01:15:02,278 --> 01:15:03,973
Are you mad at me?

1311
01:15:04,046 --> 01:15:06,412
No.

1312
01:15:06,482 --> 01:15:08,643
I'm sorry.

1313
01:15:08,717 --> 01:15:11,880
I was just trying to help.

1314
01:15:11,954 --> 01:15:13,979
I should just keep my big mouth shut.

1315
01:15:14,056 --> 01:15:15,853
Don't worry about it.

1316
01:15:21,997 --> 01:15:24,158
Wow, look at those clouds.

1317
01:15:42,017 --> 01:15:43,951
Wow, it's really coming down.

1318
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:53,019
That's a good one.

1319
01:16:05,407 --> 01:16:07,102
This is unbelievable.

1320
01:16:27,796 --> 01:16:30,230
Wow.

1321
01:16:36,338 --> 01:16:37,999
Holy shit.

1322
01:16:38,073 --> 01:16:40,371
Holy shit is right.

1323
01:16:44,546 --> 01:16:45,979
Get out of the car.

1324
01:16:47,349 --> 01:16:48,577
I'm not getting out of the car.

1325
01:16:48,651 --> 01:16:50,175
You stay in this car you might die.

1326
01:16:50,252 --> 01:16:51,981
If I leave the car I might die.

1327
01:16:52,054 --> 01:16:55,546
T.K., open the door and get out.

1328
01:17:25,087 --> 01:17:27,988
It's okay.

1329
01:17:28,057 --> 01:17:30,685
You're gonna be fine.

1330
01:17:45,541 --> 01:17:49,841
Okay. Is it gone?

1331
01:17:49,912 --> 01:17:52,813
Oh, my God.

1332
01:17:52,881 --> 01:17:54,348
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1333
01:17:54,416 --> 01:17:56,077
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

1334
01:17:56,151 --> 01:17:58,676
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1335
01:18:00,723 --> 01:18:02,520
- Is it working?
- What?

1336
01:18:02,591 --> 01:18:04,149
Is it working?

1337
01:18:04,226 --> 01:18:06,160
As a matter of fact, yeah, I think...

1338
01:18:06,228 --> 01:18:08,958
Yeah, it's working
pretty good right now, so...

1339
01:18:09,031 --> 01:18:11,261
That's great.

1340
01:18:11,333 --> 01:18:13,267
Oh, no. Okay.

1341
01:18:13,335 --> 01:18:14,302
Yeah, that's working.

1342
01:18:14,370 --> 01:18:17,737
That's great.

1343
01:18:17,806 --> 01:18:20,172
Yep.

1344
01:18:20,242 --> 01:18:23,507
Wow.

1345
01:18:23,579 --> 01:18:25,376
We should get out.

1346
01:18:40,596 --> 01:18:42,063
Hey, chief!

1347
01:18:42,131 --> 01:18:43,223
Guess what.

1348
01:18:43,298 --> 01:18:44,230
What?

1349
01:18:44,299 --> 01:18:46,028
His penis works.

1350
01:18:46,101 --> 01:18:48,296
What do you mean?
You got wood?

1351
01:18:48,370 --> 01:18:51,134
Yeah. Definitely wood.

1352
01:18:51,206 --> 01:18:53,003
So we don't need
these ladies anymore?

1353
01:18:53,075 --> 01:18:55,805
Nope. He's all fixed up.

1354
01:18:55,878 --> 01:18:57,778
He could pound a nail with that thing.

1355
01:18:57,846 --> 01:18:59,677
Pound a nail?

1356
01:18:59,748 --> 01:19:01,272
How do you know that?
Did you touch it?

1357
01:19:01,350 --> 01:19:03,978
No, I didn't have to.
It was just pokin' right into me.

1358
01:19:04,053 --> 01:19:05,782
It's a miracle.

1359
01:19:05,854 --> 01:19:08,345
You are one lucky bastard, T.K.

1360
01:19:19,435 --> 01:19:20,459
You all right?

1361
01:19:20,536 --> 01:19:22,902
Yeah, you don't seem too happy...

1362
01:19:22,971 --> 01:19:24,233
considering.

1363
01:19:24,306 --> 01:19:26,274
I'm all right.

1364
01:19:26,341 --> 01:19:27,569
Yeah, I get to see my girlfriend,

1365
01:19:27,643 --> 01:19:29,907
go back down range
like nothing ever happened.

1366
01:19:29,978 --> 01:19:32,412
T.K., what are you worried about?

1367
01:19:32,481 --> 01:19:33,948
You're on a lucky streak.

1368
01:19:34,016 --> 01:19:35,643
I don't think so.

1369
01:19:35,717 --> 01:19:37,844
I mean, you can only get lucky
for so long, you know?

1370
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:40,150
Streaks don't last forever,
and I've been burnin' some karma.

1371
01:19:40,222 --> 01:19:42,690
Hey, you can't think that way.

1372
01:19:42,758 --> 01:19:44,749
It's gonna mess your head up,
get you in trouble over there.

1373
01:19:44,827 --> 01:19:48,319
Yeah, you gotta forget about luck.

1374
01:19:48,397 --> 01:19:50,456
I mean, look at Randy.

1375
01:19:50,532 --> 01:19:52,966
Robbing Lucky Jim's, not getting caught.

1376
01:19:53,035 --> 01:19:55,629
That was lucky. Amazing.

1377
01:19:55,704 --> 01:19:59,140
But maybe if he had have got caught,

1378
01:19:59,208 --> 01:20:01,938
he would have gone to jail
and he wouldn't have enlisted,

1379
01:20:02,010 --> 01:20:03,034
and then he might be alive.

1380
01:20:03,112 --> 01:20:05,137
That might be luckier.

1381
01:20:05,214 --> 01:20:07,876
So, you know, just don't think about luck.

1382
01:20:09,852 --> 01:20:12,514
I'm on my third tour.
The odds aren't good.

1383
01:20:15,390 --> 01:20:18,848
Maybe you need to change the odds.

1384
01:20:18,927 --> 01:20:20,417
Maybe you don't go back.

1385
01:20:21,964 --> 01:20:23,124
You can go to Canada.

1386
01:20:23,198 --> 01:20:24,392
Take a break.

1387
01:20:24,466 --> 01:20:27,765
No, I can't go to Canada, man.

1388
01:20:27,836 --> 01:20:29,463
You're a coward if you go to Canada.

1389
01:20:29,538 --> 01:20:32,132
Yeah, but you're a coward that's alive.

1390
01:20:32,207 --> 01:20:34,038
Plus you've done your service.

1391
01:20:34,109 --> 01:20:36,339
Given a lot.
More than most people.

1392
01:20:36,411 --> 01:20:37,537
I can't do it, you know.

1393
01:20:37,613 --> 01:20:39,171
They got shit football in Canada.

1394
01:20:39,248 --> 01:20:40,545
Become a hockey fan.

1395
01:20:40,616 --> 01:20:42,607
No.

1396
01:20:42,684 --> 01:20:44,311
I don't know anyone up there, anyway.

1397
01:20:44,386 --> 01:20:45,478
We'll come visit you.

1398
01:20:45,554 --> 01:20:47,419
I've never been to Canada.

1399
01:20:47,489 --> 01:20:49,150
- Yeah.
- Nah.

1400
01:20:49,224 --> 01:20:51,192
- Yeah.
- I'm good.

1401
01:21:36,205 --> 01:21:38,230
Hey! There's Lucky Jim's.

1402
01:21:41,176 --> 01:21:44,236
Robbing a casino's a ballsy thing to do.

1403
01:21:44,313 --> 01:21:45,940
In a weird way, you gotta admire it.

1404
01:21:46,014 --> 01:21:49,950
You know, he was wearing
a gorilla mask when he did it.

1405
01:21:50,018 --> 01:21:52,077
On Halloween
about three years ago.

1406
01:21:52,154 --> 01:21:55,385
Nobody even looked twice
at a guy running down the street

1407
01:21:55,457 --> 01:21:57,288
wearing a mask and carrying a gun.

1408
01:22:07,636 --> 01:22:09,831
I'm happy for you, T.K.

1409
01:22:09,905 --> 01:22:12,373
You know, you're going home
to your girlfriend,

1410
01:22:12,441 --> 01:22:14,102
and that's gonna be real nice.

1411
01:22:14,176 --> 01:22:16,644
You just treat her right.

1412
01:22:16,712 --> 01:22:17,644
Okay.

1413
01:22:17,713 --> 01:22:19,112
When you get married,

1414
01:22:19,181 --> 01:22:21,672
let me know 'cause I want
to send you something.

1415
01:22:21,750 --> 01:22:23,479
You got lots of celebrating to do.

1416
01:22:23,552 --> 01:22:26,350
You got your bridal shower
and your engagement party...

1417
01:22:26,421 --> 01:22:27,353
All right, Colee.

1418
01:22:27,422 --> 01:22:28,912
- Rehearsal dinner...
- Stop, stop, stop.

1419
01:22:28,991 --> 01:22:31,323
It's gonna be nice.

1420
01:22:31,393 --> 01:22:33,987
Just take care.

1421
01:22:37,933 --> 01:22:39,958
That was a bit forward.

1422
01:22:41,236 --> 01:22:42,635
Good luck at the tables.

1423
01:22:42,704 --> 01:22:43,796
Listen to me.

1424
01:22:43,872 --> 01:22:46,568
You go home,
do what you need to do there.

1425
01:22:46,642 --> 01:22:48,803
If I were you, I'd think twice
about going back.

1426
01:22:50,579 --> 01:22:52,706
Well, if I go home, I'm going back.

1427
01:22:52,781 --> 01:22:56,911
You know, my whole family's in the Army,
so it's almost the same thing.

1428
01:22:59,755 --> 01:23:02,315
Well, see you guys.

1429
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:16,162
So, uh, you sure you don't want me
to drive you over to Randy's?

1430
01:23:16,238 --> 01:23:18,900
No, I gotta do this by myself.

1431
01:23:18,974 --> 01:23:20,202
Thanks.

1432
01:23:20,275 --> 01:23:22,209
I'll take a taxi.

1433
01:23:22,277 --> 01:23:24,268
Well, if you need anything,

1434
01:23:24,346 --> 01:23:26,075
you give me a call.

1435
01:23:26,148 --> 01:23:27,706
All right?

1436
01:23:29,918 --> 01:23:33,251
I'm real sorry about that guitar.

1437
01:23:33,322 --> 01:23:34,880
Forget it.

1438
01:23:36,491 --> 01:23:38,322
You bring it to them.

1439
01:23:40,362 --> 01:23:42,125
They're gonna love you.

1440
01:23:52,674 --> 01:23:56,940
...worried about blowing up
some abandoned Iraqi tanks

1441
01:23:57,012 --> 01:23:58,604
and other personnel carriers...

1442
01:23:58,680 --> 01:23:59,612
What'll it be?

1443
01:23:59,681 --> 01:24:02,809
Can I get a shot of tequila?

1444
01:24:02,884 --> 01:24:07,082
Suddenly, out of an alleyway, wham!

1445
01:24:07,155 --> 01:24:10,682
There comes an RPG
and missiles from the air.

1446
01:24:10,759 --> 01:24:12,989
We have been trying
to get a live report...

1447
01:24:13,061 --> 01:24:14,926
Can you make that a double?

1448
01:24:41,223 --> 01:24:42,781
- Yes?
- Hi.

1449
01:24:42,858 --> 01:24:45,986
I'm Colee Dunn.

1450
01:24:46,061 --> 01:24:47,961
I was a friend of Randy's.

1451
01:24:48,029 --> 01:24:50,896
We served together and...

1452
01:24:50,966 --> 01:24:52,991
this is his guitar.

1453
01:24:57,806 --> 01:24:59,273
Well, come in.

1454
01:24:59,341 --> 01:25:01,605
And these flowers are for you, too.

1455
01:25:04,312 --> 01:25:06,177
Thank you.

1456
01:25:06,248 --> 01:25:08,648
We love flowers.

1457
01:25:11,453 --> 01:25:13,944
Here we are.

1458
01:25:14,022 --> 01:25:17,822
You know, you have
such a beautiful home.

1459
01:25:17,893 --> 01:25:19,258
Thanks.

1460
01:25:21,797 --> 01:25:22,764
I guess you didn't...

1461
01:25:22,831 --> 01:25:26,096
you didn't really need the flowers.

1462
01:25:26,168 --> 01:25:29,501
Well, we're always happy for more.

1463
01:25:29,571 --> 01:25:31,937
We have a flower
wholesaling business, so...

1464
01:25:32,007 --> 01:25:34,703
Randy probably told you that.

1465
01:25:34,776 --> 01:25:36,266
Of course, he never liked working there.

1466
01:25:36,344 --> 01:25:38,403
You know boys.

1467
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:42,883
Always trying to prove they're men.

1468
01:25:42,951 --> 01:25:44,418
I guess working in a flower shop

1469
01:25:44,486 --> 01:25:48,252
didn't quite go with that.

1470
01:25:48,323 --> 01:25:49,950
I must say, I didn't even know

1471
01:25:50,025 --> 01:25:52,493
that Randy played the guitar.

1472
01:25:54,129 --> 01:25:56,757
I thought that...

1473
01:25:56,832 --> 01:25:59,198
I thought that
maybe you gave it to him.

1474
01:26:03,305 --> 01:26:05,034
It wasn't in your family?

1475
01:26:05,106 --> 01:26:06,164
No.

1476
01:26:06,241 --> 01:26:09,608
Our family was never too musical.

1477
01:26:09,678 --> 01:26:13,170
So I don't know where he would have
gotten such a nice guitar.

1478
01:26:16,451 --> 01:26:18,612
That's funny.

1479
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:44,434
How are you doing today, sir?

1480
01:26:46,114 --> 01:26:47,911
I'll know in about 30 minutes.

1481
01:26:50,252 --> 01:26:52,311
Never too old to sign up.

1482
01:26:52,387 --> 01:26:55,356
You ever think about it?

1483
01:26:55,423 --> 01:26:57,516
I just got out.

1484
01:26:57,592 --> 01:26:59,321
That'd be the best time to get back in.

1485
01:27:00,428 --> 01:27:02,089
Yeah.

1486
01:27:10,005 --> 01:27:11,563
There you go, sweetie.

1487
01:27:13,842 --> 01:27:15,332
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

1488
01:27:15,410 --> 01:27:17,776

Can I help you?

1492
01:27:36,698 --> 01:27:37,892
- No, no, no.
- No?

1493
01:27:37,966 --> 01:27:39,160
- You sure?
- Yes.

1494
01:27:39,234 --> 01:27:43,295
Just tell us some more
stories about Randy.

1495
01:27:44,472 --> 01:27:46,440
Okay...

1496
01:27:48,043 --> 01:27:51,012
All right, I'm gonna get that.
Tom, that toast is burning.

1497
01:27:59,220 --> 01:28:02,087
Shannon, this is Colee.

1498
01:28:02,157 --> 01:28:03,852
Colee served with Randy.

1499
01:28:03,925 --> 01:28:06,285
Hi.

1500
01:28:06,361 --> 01:28:09,728
And this is little Jessie.

1501
01:28:09,798 --> 01:28:12,460
He looks just like
his daddy, don't you think?

1502
01:28:12,534 --> 01:28:14,058
He's got Randy's eyes.

1503
01:28:14,135 --> 01:28:17,036
But he's got a bald spot just like you.

1504
01:28:18,139 --> 01:28:20,437
Give me that baby.

1505
01:28:20,508 --> 01:28:23,136
Stop it.

1506
01:28:24,245 --> 01:28:26,805
That's my boy. Yeah.

1507
01:28:41,129 --> 01:28:42,756
How you doing?

1508
01:28:44,499 --> 01:28:45,761
I'm good.

1509
01:28:45,834 --> 01:28:48,564
I'm sorry, Colee.

1510
01:28:48,637 --> 01:28:50,901
You didn't know about Shannon, did ya?

1511
01:28:50,972 --> 01:28:54,135
Yeah, I knew.

1512
01:28:54,209 --> 01:28:55,471
I knew about that.

1513
01:28:55,543 --> 01:28:58,307
He's a damn fool, Randy.

1514
01:28:58,380 --> 01:29:00,041
He never slept with the girl but once.

1515
01:29:00,115 --> 01:29:01,639
He barely knew her.

1516
01:29:01,716 --> 01:29:04,116
But she got pregnant.

1517
01:29:04,185 --> 01:29:07,518
Then he disappeared
and, of course, we felt responsible.

1518
01:29:07,589 --> 01:29:09,147
She was gonna have a baby.

1519
01:29:14,162 --> 01:29:16,892
It doesn't change
whatever you had with Randy.

1520
01:29:16,965 --> 01:29:19,092
Hope you know that.

1521
01:29:25,507 --> 01:29:29,807
<i>This is the final call for Air Canada
Flight 63 to Vancouver.</i>

1522
01:30:29,270 --> 01:30:32,103
He's looking at me to see
if it's okay to eat them.

1523
01:30:32,173 --> 01:30:33,800
- Yes, you may eat them.
- You go right ahead.

1524
01:30:33,875 --> 01:30:35,172
That's delicious.

1525
01:30:38,947 --> 01:30:40,437
Hey, Colee.

1526
01:30:40,515 --> 01:30:43,951
I just want to say

1527
01:30:44,018 --> 01:30:47,920
that Jeanie and I
have talked about this,

1528
01:30:47,989 --> 01:30:51,220
and seeing that you're
kind of out of touch

1529
01:30:51,292 --> 01:30:53,760
with your own family,

1530
01:30:53,828 --> 01:30:58,128
well, we want you to know that...

1531
01:30:58,199 --> 01:30:59,461
that you're welcome to stay here

1532
01:30:59,534 --> 01:31:00,865
for the rest of your leave.

1533
01:31:00,935 --> 01:31:02,459
Really?

1534
01:31:09,711 --> 01:31:11,440
Wow, that's...

1535
01:31:14,983 --> 01:31:16,541
That's so nice.

1536
01:31:18,653 --> 01:31:20,553
I have something that I want to say, too.

1537
01:31:27,562 --> 01:31:31,555
Shannon...

1538
01:31:31,633 --> 01:31:33,897
there's a couple things that you should know.

1539
01:31:37,939 --> 01:31:41,932
Randy... he loved you
with all his heart and soul,

1540
01:31:42,010 --> 01:31:45,036
and he talked about you all the time.

1541
01:31:47,816 --> 01:31:51,775
And, you know, he knew
that he had made a big mistake

1542
01:31:51,853 --> 01:31:54,788
and he was gonna make it up to you.

1543
01:31:57,225 --> 01:32:00,922
And, Tom and Jeanie,
he just loved you so much.

1544
01:32:00,995 --> 01:32:02,690
He knew what great parents you were

1545
01:32:02,764 --> 01:32:07,633
and grandparents, too, and...

1546
01:32:07,702 --> 01:32:11,229
and he was just so looking forward
to coming home.

1547
01:32:15,510 --> 01:32:17,671
Ya'll have been so nice to me.

1548
01:32:17,745 --> 01:32:19,007
And I think I should go.

1549
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:20,911
- No, no, no.
- Yeah, no...

1550
01:32:20,982 --> 01:32:21,914
You can stay, can't ya?

1551
01:32:21,983 --> 01:32:23,450
No, I think I should go.

1552
01:32:26,955 --> 01:32:30,857
And, you know, I was thinking...

1553
01:32:30,925 --> 01:32:33,086
would it be all right if I took that guitar?

1554
01:32:33,161 --> 01:32:35,026
Randy's guitar?

1555
01:32:35,096 --> 01:32:37,496
Is that okay?

1556
01:32:39,601 --> 01:32:41,193
You take it.

1557
01:32:43,104 --> 01:32:45,698
You're welcome to it.

1558
01:32:47,942 --> 01:32:49,773
Thank you.

1559
01:33:25,546 --> 01:33:26,740
Excuse me.

1560
01:33:26,814 --> 01:33:30,113
I have a friend who I think got arrested.

1561
01:33:30,184 --> 01:33:31,151
You just brought him in.

1562
01:33:31,219 --> 01:33:32,743
- What's the name?
- Poole.

1563
01:33:32,820 --> 01:33:33,844
T.K. Poole.

1564
01:33:38,026 --> 01:33:39,926
Yeah, we got him.

1565
01:33:39,994 --> 01:33:41,427
Can I see him?

1566
01:33:41,496 --> 01:33:43,361
He's still being processed.
You're gonna have to wait.

1567
01:33:45,833 --> 01:33:46,925
What'd he do?

1568
01:33:47,001 --> 01:33:48,832
Doesn't say.

1569
01:33:48,903 --> 01:33:51,633
Must have done something.

1570
01:33:56,044 --> 01:33:57,011
Hello?

1571
01:33:57,078 --> 01:33:58,477
Cheaver!

1572
01:33:58,546 --> 01:34:00,446
Guess what. I got the guitar.

1573
01:34:00,515 --> 01:34:02,676
I told you not to worry about that.

1574
01:34:02,750 --> 01:34:05,218
Are you still in Vegas?
Can I come meet you?

1575
01:34:12,093 --> 01:34:14,027
- Hey.
- Hey.

1576
01:34:22,804 --> 01:34:24,294
How is he?

1577
01:34:24,372 --> 01:34:25,805
They won't let me see him.

1578
01:34:25,873 --> 01:34:28,774
Well, what did he do?

1579
01:34:28,843 --> 01:34:30,834
I don't know.

1580
01:34:36,050 --> 01:34:38,450
Sir? When can we see our friend?

1581
01:34:38,519 --> 01:34:40,009
You can't.

1582
01:34:40,088 --> 01:34:42,352
Listen, we gotta see him.

1583
01:34:42,423 --> 01:34:44,118
He's in the Army. We all are.

1584
01:34:44,192 --> 01:34:46,251
And he's home on leave for just 30 days.

1585
01:34:46,327 --> 01:34:48,022
Now you might not know what that's like...

1586
01:34:48,096 --> 01:34:50,724
I know just what that's like.

1587
01:34:50,798 --> 01:34:52,959
I was a Marine in Desert Storm.

1588
01:34:54,635 --> 01:34:56,865
Well, then maybe you can help us out.

1589
01:35:05,847 --> 01:35:08,577
I have my problems
with my approach shot.

1590
01:35:08,649 --> 01:35:10,207
Oh, see, yeah.

1591
01:35:10,284 --> 01:35:12,252
All you gotta do is just shorten up
that back swing,

1592
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:15,289
and I guarantee
you'll hit the green every time.

1593
01:35:16,991 --> 01:35:18,424
That's it.

1594
01:35:18,493 --> 01:35:19,960
Like, I don't like to brag,

1595
01:35:20,028 --> 01:35:21,325
'cause bragging doesn't come easy to me,

1596
01:35:21,396 --> 01:35:24,888
but, you know, last time I played
Number 4 at Kuwait City,

1597
01:35:24,966 --> 01:35:26,456
I got a hole in one.

1598
01:35:26,534 --> 01:35:28,559
- Aw, come on, you're bullshitting me.
- No. I'm serious.

1599
01:35:28,636 --> 01:35:31,764
And it was amazing because
the ball never even hit the grass.

1600
01:35:31,839 --> 01:35:34,069
It just dropped straight in the hole.

1601
01:35:34,142 --> 01:35:35,473
There was nothing but cup.

1602
01:35:35,543 --> 01:35:37,738
Swear...

1603
01:35:37,812 --> 01:35:39,677
That's amazing.

1604
01:35:39,747 --> 01:35:40,771
Beautiful, beautiful.

1605
01:35:40,848 --> 01:35:41,872
You know these two?

1606
01:35:43,518 --> 01:35:45,281
Yeah. Hey, guys.

1607
01:35:45,353 --> 01:35:46,980
Hi.

1608
01:35:47,055 --> 01:35:48,920
Hey, your friend here is a real hero.

1609
01:35:48,990 --> 01:35:51,151
Yeah, we know, but why is he here?

1610
01:35:51,225 --> 01:35:53,955
He's here because
he served his country honorably

1611
01:35:54,028 --> 01:35:57,293
and then he came back
and took responsibility for a past mistake.

1612
01:35:57,365 --> 01:35:58,662
That's as brave as it gets.

1613
01:35:58,733 --> 01:36:00,598
What's the charge?

1614
01:36:00,668 --> 01:36:01,760
Armed robbery.

1615
01:36:01,836 --> 01:36:02,996
Armed robbery?

1616
01:36:03,071 --> 01:36:04,834
What did he rob?

1617
01:36:04,906 --> 01:36:07,875
You ever heard of a casino
called Lucky Jim's?

1618
01:36:12,447 --> 01:36:14,312
Yeah.

1619
01:36:14,382 --> 01:36:15,815
Yeah, I heard of that.

1620
01:36:15,883 --> 01:36:19,478
So you robbed Lucky Jim's?

1621
01:36:19,554 --> 01:36:22,148
Yeah.

1622
01:36:22,223 --> 01:36:25,818
And couldn't keep it a secret anymore.

1623
01:36:25,893 --> 01:36:28,521
The guilt was just keeping me up at night.

1624
01:36:28,596 --> 01:36:31,121
A guy who can man up
to his past got my respect.

1625
01:36:35,603 --> 01:36:37,662
Could we have a moment alone with him?

1626
01:36:37,738 --> 01:36:39,603
Is that all right with you?

1627
01:36:39,674 --> 01:36:41,164
Yeah.

1628
01:36:46,647 --> 01:36:48,842
Lucky Jim's?

1629
01:36:48,916 --> 01:36:50,315
Why are you doing this?

1630
01:36:50,384 --> 01:36:53,217
Well, like you said,
I gotta do what I gotta do.

1631
01:36:53,287 --> 01:36:55,187
Find a way to stay alive.

1632
01:36:55,256 --> 01:36:57,554
What, to keep from going back?

1633
01:36:57,625 --> 01:36:59,024
Yeah, it's perfect.

1634
01:36:59,093 --> 01:37:01,561
No. You're gonna go to prison.

1635
01:37:01,629 --> 01:37:03,961
Look at me.
Prison's gonna be easy on a guy like me.

1636
01:37:04,031 --> 01:37:06,056
I got it all figured out.

1637
01:37:06,134 --> 01:37:07,533
I can get a college degree in there.

1638
01:37:07,602 --> 01:37:10,503
These guys said I'll be out in 18 months.

1639
01:37:10,571 --> 01:37:12,664
This is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1640
01:37:12,740 --> 01:37:13,866
You'll be an ex-con.

1641
01:37:13,941 --> 01:37:16,034
- Yeah, but a living ex-con.
- Right.

1642
01:37:16,110 --> 01:37:19,102
T.K., this is crazy.

1643
01:37:19,180 --> 01:37:20,772
Everybody okay in here?

1644
01:37:20,848 --> 01:37:22,543
- Yep.
- Yes.

1645
01:37:22,617 --> 01:37:25,108
You didn't get hit too hard in the head
fighting over there, did ya?

1646
01:37:25,186 --> 01:37:26,312
No, sir. No.

1647
01:37:26,387 --> 01:37:30,448
Well, then you're all very funny.

1648
01:37:30,525 --> 01:37:33,551
So funny you can get your asses
the hell out of here.

1649
01:37:33,628 --> 01:37:37,564
You think I got time to waste,
Mr. Big Shot Hero?

1650
01:37:37,632 --> 01:37:39,532
You rob Lucky Jim's?

1651
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:40,692
Yes, sir.

1652
01:37:40,768 --> 01:37:42,565
That's interesting.

1653
01:37:42,637 --> 01:37:45,265
'Cause Lucky Jim's
has never been robbed.

1654
01:37:48,476 --> 01:37:50,569
Sure it has.

1655
01:37:50,645 --> 01:37:52,909
I checked all the records.

1656
01:37:52,980 --> 01:37:56,711
And I just got off the phone
with Lucky Jim himself.

1657
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:00,947
Now come on, get out of here.

1658
01:38:01,022 --> 01:38:02,649
Take a walk.

1659
01:38:13,534 --> 01:38:14,728
T.K., you okay?

1660
01:38:15,736 --> 01:38:17,761
Hey.

1661
01:38:17,838 --> 01:38:19,533
Oh, man.

1662
01:38:19,607 --> 01:38:22,132
I can't believe I almost did that.

1663
01:38:24,812 --> 01:38:25,938
I can't believe I did that.

1664
01:38:26,013 --> 01:38:28,982
Don't worry. We get it.

1665
01:38:32,553 --> 01:38:34,521
I'm sorry, guys.

1666
01:38:34,589 --> 01:38:36,318
- Don't worry about it.
- Nah, I'm real sorry.

1667
01:38:36,390 --> 01:38:38,324
It's okay.

1668
01:38:38,392 --> 01:38:41,122
Now I'm fucked up.

1669
01:38:45,399 --> 01:38:47,697
Wow, it's official.
I'm fucked up.

1670
01:38:49,704 --> 01:38:51,331
Did you guys know how fucked up I was?

1671
01:38:53,708 --> 01:38:56,609
Didn't really show... that much.

1672
01:38:56,677 --> 01:39:00,340
I gotta reevaluate.

1673
01:39:00,414 --> 01:39:01,813
You know what?

1674
01:39:01,882 --> 01:39:03,816
I'm starting to see things
more clearly right now.

1675
01:39:03,884 --> 01:39:05,613
Good.

1676
01:39:05,686 --> 01:39:07,745
Great.

1677
01:39:07,822 --> 01:39:09,312
I realize that...

1678
01:39:13,561 --> 01:39:16,257
I don't know shit, man.

1679
01:39:16,330 --> 01:39:18,321
Fuck.

1680
01:39:20,167 --> 01:39:21,691
I don't know shit.

1681
01:39:23,070 --> 01:39:25,538
You know some things.

1682
01:39:25,606 --> 01:39:26,538
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1683
01:39:27,608 --> 01:39:29,337
You got the basic skills.

1684
01:39:37,752 --> 01:39:40,448
So how were Randy's parents?

1685
01:39:40,521 --> 01:39:42,216
They were real nice.

1686
01:39:42,290 --> 01:39:43,655
Good, I'm glad.

1687
01:39:43,724 --> 01:39:46,192
And so was Randy's girlfriend
and his baby, too.

1688
01:39:46,260 --> 01:39:47,488
- Oh. God.
- Ouch.

1689
01:39:47,561 --> 01:39:48,653
Yep.

1690
01:39:50,264 --> 01:39:52,960
But look, I got the guitar,

1691
01:39:53,034 --> 01:39:54,865
and, Cheaver, I want you to have it.

1692
01:39:54,935 --> 01:39:57,665
That's real sweet of you,

1693
01:39:57,738 --> 01:40:00,502
but I don't need it.

1694
01:40:01,876 --> 01:40:02,865
I got the money.

1695
01:40:02,943 --> 01:40:04,843
- What?
- How much did you win?

1696
01:40:04,912 --> 01:40:09,349
I didn't win anything.
I didn't even place a bet.

1697
01:40:09,417 --> 01:40:10,543
I reenlisted.

1698
01:40:10,618 --> 01:40:15,085
You what?

1699
01:40:16,624 --> 01:40:18,455
I reenlisted.

1700
01:40:18,526 --> 01:40:20,426
Got a $20,000 signing bonus.

1701
01:40:20,494 --> 01:40:22,758
I'm all set.

1702
01:40:22,830 --> 01:40:24,388
That's insane.

1703
01:40:24,465 --> 01:40:25,898
You're calling me insane?

1704
01:40:25,966 --> 01:40:27,661
Cheaver, I got you the guitar.

1705
01:40:27,735 --> 01:40:29,726
Sell it. Get the money that way.

1706
01:40:29,804 --> 01:40:32,739
You need that guitar
more than I do, Colee.

1707
01:40:32,807 --> 01:40:35,332
No. I got Army money saved up.

1708
01:40:35,409 --> 01:40:37,536
I'm gonna be fine.

1709
01:40:37,611 --> 01:40:39,909
And I'm gonna find my mom
and patch things up,

1710
01:40:39,980 --> 01:40:41,345
so you take it.

1711
01:40:41,415 --> 01:40:43,747
No. I'm going back.

1712
01:40:43,818 --> 01:40:45,285
Recruiter called my home unit.

1713
01:40:45,353 --> 01:40:47,116
They're transferring the paperwork now.

1714
01:40:47,188 --> 01:40:49,679
You can get out of that.

1715
01:40:49,757 --> 01:40:52,089
I don't know that I want to.

1716
01:40:52,159 --> 01:40:54,753
Cheaver, take the guitar.

1717
01:40:54,829 --> 01:40:56,353
Please.

1718
01:40:58,966 --> 01:41:01,059
You take that guitar, Colee.

1719
01:41:02,403 --> 01:41:04,200
It's your guitar.

1720
01:41:04,271 --> 01:41:05,704
Yeah?

1721
01:41:05,773 --> 01:41:08,173
Yeah.

1722
01:41:10,311 --> 01:41:11,369
Thank you.

1723
01:41:11,445 --> 01:41:15,176
No. Thank you.

1724
01:42:01,128 --> 01:42:02,720
Sergeant.

1725
01:42:04,031 --> 01:42:06,431
T.K.

1726
01:42:06,500 --> 01:42:07,467
How are ya?

1727
01:42:07,535 --> 01:42:09,901
Good. Good.

1728
01:42:09,970 --> 01:42:11,665
So you got here.

1729
01:42:13,841 --> 01:42:15,934
Excuse me.

1730
01:42:19,613 --> 01:42:21,308
- Look who it is.
- Hey.

1731
01:42:21,382 --> 01:42:23,714
- How are ya?
- Good. How are you doing?

1732
01:42:23,784 --> 01:42:25,752
- How are you doing?
- How are you doing?

1733
01:42:28,088 --> 01:42:29,055
Where's your guitar?

1734
01:42:29,123 --> 01:42:30,522
Did you sell it?

1735
01:42:30,591 --> 01:42:32,286
Sell it?

1736
01:42:32,359 --> 01:42:34,293
Hell, no. I'm learning how to play it.

1737
01:42:34,361 --> 01:42:36,090
- You're learning to play it?
- Yep.

1738
01:42:36,163 --> 01:42:37,653
All right.

1739
01:42:40,334 --> 01:42:42,894
How's your fiancée?

1740
01:42:42,970 --> 01:42:45,404
She's fine.

1741
01:42:45,473 --> 01:42:47,964
But she's not my fiancée anymore.

1742
01:42:53,047 --> 01:42:54,344
Where are you going?

1743
01:42:54,415 --> 01:42:55,643
I'm going to Diyala.

1744
01:42:55,716 --> 01:42:58,150
- Where are you going?
- Anbar.

1745
01:43:00,120 --> 01:43:01,553
Where are you going?

1746
01:43:01,622 --> 01:43:03,112
Tikrit.
