881
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,553
If you're up for it.

882
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:43,056
The thing is, after...

883
00:40:43,158 --> 00:40:44,424
hanging out with you this weekend,

884
00:40:44,526 --> 00:40:48,061
I've kind of realized how much I...

885
00:40:48,163 --> 00:40:49,563
You missed me.

886
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,100
(LAUGHS)

887
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:56,203
Yeah, you missed me, yes, you did!

888
00:40:56,304 --> 00:40:59,039
Well, I missed you, too.

889
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,807
(LAUGHS)

890
00:41:03,478 --> 00:41:04,711
(LAUGHS)

891
00:41:04,812 --> 00:41:07,614
- Jade!
- I'm here.

892
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:10,150
TY: Oh, thanks for coming, Jade.

893
00:41:10,251 --> 00:41:12,419
Yeah, you bet, what's going on?

894
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,421
Well, first of all,
I have to be honest with you,

895
00:41:14,522 --> 00:41:15,956
and say that...

896
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:18,258
I wasn't so sure about
you babysitting Lyndy.

897
00:41:18,359 --> 00:41:20,694
- Yeah, that makes two of us.
- But I was wrong.

898
00:41:20,795 --> 00:41:22,963
Amy and I have been talking,
and we wanna offer you

899
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:25,132
a full-time baby-sitting gig with Lyndy.

900
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:27,801
Wow, I'm flattered.

901
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,504
And I love hanging out with Lyndy.

902
00:41:30,605 --> 00:41:34,241
- But I'm gonna have to pass.
- Hmm? Why?

903
00:41:35,276 --> 00:41:37,978
Well, I just had a great
appointment with my doctor.

904
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,647
And I'm not a 100% yet
but I am improving,

905
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:43,650
So I called Tim,
and I told him that I wanted to help out

906
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,719
mentoring students at the rodeo school.

907
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:48,755
That's great, you know,
I'm-I'm really happy

908
00:41:48,856 --> 00:41:51,391
to hear you're getting
back in the scene.

909
00:41:51,492 --> 00:41:53,660
Yeah, I... I hope you do well.

910
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:56,263
Good for you, I mean, all the best.

911
00:41:56,364 --> 00:41:58,732
LYNDY: I pee. (FLUSHING SOUND)

912
00:41:58,833 --> 00:42:00,734
I pee. (TOILET CHEERING)

913
00:42:00,835 --> 00:42:03,170
I pee.

914
00:42:05,173 --> 00:42:06,940
I only did about 80% of
the stuff in this book,

915
00:42:07,041 --> 00:42:08,709
but it seems to be working.

916
00:42:10,912 --> 00:42:12,646
Look at you, you cute little doodle!

917
00:42:12,747 --> 00:42:15,749
How was that? Good for you!

918
00:42:17,185 --> 00:42:18,752

Coffee and biscuits.

924
00:42:37,438 --> 00:42:39,873
Made 'em this afternoon, new recipe.

925
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:42,342
Oh, look at you,
opening yourself up to new things.

926
00:42:42,443 --> 00:42:43,877
Wonders never cease.

927
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:47,147
And they're pretty darn good,
if I do say so myself.

928
00:42:47,248 --> 00:42:49,383
What're you doing here, Jack?

929
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:50,884
I wanted to check out your place.

930
00:42:53,288 --> 00:42:56,089
(FIRE CRACKLES)

931
00:42:57,721 --> 00:42:59,693
You worried about me?

932
00:43:00,812 --> 00:43:02,445
Hardly.

933
00:43:02,672 --> 00:43:04,931
You missed me, right? Is that it?

934
00:43:06,934 --> 00:43:09,136
Don't make me regret coming here.

935
00:43:09,237 --> 00:43:11,004
Oh, come on, don't deny it.

936
00:43:11,105 --> 00:43:12,806
Will you let it go?

937
00:43:12,907 --> 00:43:14,941
Okay.

938
00:43:15,043 --> 00:43:17,477
Sure, yeah, I can let it go, 'cause...

939
00:43:17,578 --> 00:43:19,946
I know it's the truth.

940
00:43:21,261 --> 00:43:23,483
