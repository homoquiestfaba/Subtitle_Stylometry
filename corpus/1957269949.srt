1
00:00:33,455 --> 00:00:34,629
Hi.

2
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:53,999
Tag, you're it.

3
00:01:06,864 --> 00:01:08,578
Oh, sh--

4
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,436
Hey.

5
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:13,131
Hey, I'm driving this
gigantic truck I just got.

6
00:01:13,133 --> 00:01:14,221
Come out to the curb.

7
00:01:14,221 --> 00:01:15,735
Yeah, I'm already on the curb.

8
00:01:15,735 --> 00:01:17,533
I'll see you in a sec.

9
00:01:20,393 --> 00:01:22,158
Can't believe this is
the last of it already.

10
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,056
Yup.

11
00:01:23,261 --> 00:01:25,697
So you want me to use the truck
to drop you off at work?

12
00:01:25,697 --> 00:01:27,947
You need the truck for the
last bit of the stuff, right?

13
00:01:27,947 --> 00:01:30,290
Yeah, but what if your
car doesn't start again?

14
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:34,072
That won't happen, but if
it does, I'll ride my bike.

15
00:01:34,072 --> 00:01:36,309
The truck is a gift to you.

16
00:01:36,311 --> 00:01:37,109
Oh?

17
00:01:39,105 --> 00:01:40,980
You deserve a gift. You're
starting work tomorrow.

18
00:01:40,982 --> 00:01:43,958
Well, it's just another
dog training client.

19
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,825
Yeah, well, you'll find
something else soon.

20
00:01:45,825 --> 00:01:49,354
Yeah, I just feel like I'm taking a step
backwards training people's dogs again.

21
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,385
I'm sorry, it's--it's
not your fault.

22
00:01:53,634 --> 00:01:55,843
Well, technically no.

23
00:01:55,843 --> 00:01:57,638
Well, I mean, I guess
I'd be more excited

24
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,042
if I felt like you were more
excited that I came back.

25
00:02:03,406 --> 00:02:04,414
Hold on.

26
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,243
We're re-doing the phone call.

27
00:02:06,245 --> 00:02:06,790
What?

28
00:02:06,792 --> 00:02:09,464
Here, you're in Chicago, I'm in L.A.,
you're telling me you're moving.

29
00:02:10,956 --> 00:02:12,052
All right.

30
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,394
Aren't you gonna answer?

31
00:02:17,396 --> 00:02:18,291
Never on the first ring.

32
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:20,931
Hello?

33
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:22,525
Hi. It's me.

34
00:02:22,525 --> 00:02:24,345
Hey, kind of a bad time.

35
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:27,194
Did you have something
you wanted to tell me?

36
00:02:27,196 --> 00:02:28,405
Yes.

37
00:02:29,309 --> 00:02:32,016
I miss you and I'm moving back.

38
00:02:32,812 --> 00:02:34,109
I'm leaving my job.

39
00:02:34,606 --> 00:02:36,079
That is exciting news.

40
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:37,461
I can't wait.

41
00:02:37,746 --> 00:02:38,998
I love you.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,857
I can't wait for you to be here.

43
00:02:42,405 --> 00:02:43,332
Thank you. I

44
00:02:43,659 --> 00:02:44,765
believe you.

45
00:02:45,414 --> 00:02:46,350
Good.

46
00:02:48,215 --> 00:02:49,259
All right, now we can drive.

47
00:02:49,261 --> 00:02:51,231
Okay, 'cause that
was ridiculous.

48
00:03:46,581 --> 00:03:51,524
Everything in my brain tells me that
she doesn't deserve a second chance.

49
00:03:52,374 --> 00:03:54,114
You know, but it's my mom,

50
00:03:54,116 --> 00:03:56,512
it's like something in
my gut tells me I just

51
00:03:57,224 --> 00:04:00,236
need to make up with her and start over.
I can't shake it.

52
00:04:00,888 --> 00:04:06,298
Harry, try to think of your gut instincts
as you, on your death bed, um,

53
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,444
sending a message back in time.

54
00:04:09,444 --> 00:04:13,069
You can-- It's okay.

55
00:04:13,071 --> 00:04:15,184
You can argue with your
instincts all you want,

56
00:04:15,184 --> 00:04:17,690
you can try to outthink
them but in the end,

57
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:20,404
you're only gonna hurt yourself if
you don't at least acknowledge them.

58
00:04:20,406 --> 00:04:21,504
Oh, I'm sorry.

59
00:04:23,768 --> 00:04:25,517
Harry, we're really
on to something.

60
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:27,974
No, no, I know we are, but if
you're gonna show up late,

61
00:04:27,974 --> 00:04:29,554
you at least gotta
shower or something.

62
00:04:29,556 --> 00:04:31,764
I mean, you look
like you got TB.

63
00:04:32,335 --> 00:04:34,439
Sorry, I just-- I had
to ride my bike here.

64
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:37,584
My car wouldn't start and I was
moving somebody this morning.

65
00:04:37,584 --> 00:04:40,024
Moving? Are you a
moving guy or a shrink?

66
00:04:40,858 --> 00:04:43,184
He was helping my daughter move.

67
00:04:43,504 --> 00:04:45,197
He's been a good boyfriend.

68
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,464
They've been together
for seven years.

69
00:04:46,464 --> 00:04:47,354
Six years.

70
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:48,164
Six years.

71
00:04:48,962 --> 00:04:49,851
That's exciting.

72
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,522
Yeah, I just I didn't
realize that when I was

73
00:04:53,524 --> 00:04:56,164
letting you sit in on
my therapy sessions

74
00:04:56,164 --> 00:04:59,104
that I pay for that that
it was a family thing.

75
00:05:00,822 --> 00:05:04,124
How are you doing with
your night terrors?

76
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:09,214
I just didn't realize that he's here
because he's humping your daughter.

77
00:05:12,454 --> 00:05:13,256
Excuse me.

78
00:05:40,335 --> 00:05:40,938
Dude!

79
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,739
Whoa!

80
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:44,077
Watch where you're going!
You almost killed me!

81
00:05:47,056 --> 00:05:48,385
Are you okay?

82
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:51,873
Yeah, no, I'm fine, just kind
of rolled the knee a little.

83
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:52,326
Here.

84
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,826
I will give you the
kind of moral support

85
00:05:54,828 --> 00:05:58,885
that only a stranger can provide to
you, while I wait. While you wait.

86
00:05:58,887 --> 00:06:00,507
Well-well, thank you.

87
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:01,341
You're welcome.

88
00:06:02,542 --> 00:06:03,986
I'm Johnny Knoxville,
by the way.

89
00:06:05,963 --> 00:06:07,496
It's nice to meet you, Johnny.

90
00:06:08,348 --> 00:06:09,388
Ben actually.

91
00:06:10,293 --> 00:06:12,181
So, Ben, are you always
this uncoordinated

92
00:06:12,183 --> 00:06:14,671
or is it like a Clark
Kent kind of thing

93
00:06:14,673 --> 00:06:16,341
where it's an act to cover
up your superpowers?

94
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,946
Yeah, actually that's
exactly what it is.

95
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:19,343
Yeah?

96
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:22,497
Yeah. Yeah, I used to do the
glasses thing, you know,

97
00:06:22,499 --> 00:06:25,349
but then I just started
amping up the number of times

98
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:27,337
I throw myself off moving
objects every day.

99
00:06:27,337 --> 00:06:28,181
I like that.

100
00:06:32,524 --> 00:06:34,308
Actually, I was
kind of distracted.

101
00:06:34,308 --> 00:06:37,837
I was watching this girl read
a book over by that tree.

102
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:42,746
I do have pretty good book reading
skills though so, thanks for noticing.

103
00:06:42,748 --> 00:06:45,727
You should see me
dunk, really good.

104
00:06:45,727 --> 00:06:47,375
Really? Like basketball?

105
00:06:47,377 --> 00:06:47,985
Yeah.

106
00:06:47,985 --> 00:06:48,740
Wow.

107
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:50,862
Hmm. How tall are you?

108
00:06:51,423 --> 00:06:52,674
You don't believe me?

109
00:06:53,191 --> 00:06:55,484
I'm good, I'm really good.
I play every day.

110
00:06:55,677 --> 00:06:56,097
Okay.

111
00:06:56,099 --> 00:06:57,755
They're naming the
courts after me.

112
00:06:57,757 --> 00:06:59,205
-Really? What, these courts?
-Yeah,

113
00:06:59,205 --> 00:07:02,503
yeah. Nadia's Courts of Wonder.

114
00:07:02,503 --> 00:07:05,282
Hmm, okay. I can buy that.

115
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:22,327
Wow. Well, thank you.

116
00:07:22,914 --> 00:07:23,963
You're welcome.

117
00:07:43,815 --> 00:07:44,815
Look at that.

118
00:07:45,227 --> 00:07:47,651
Started right up, I didn't even
do nothing, I looked at it.

119
00:07:47,653 --> 00:07:49,646
Of course it starts now,
I have nowhere to go.

120
00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:55,262
You're still gonna get me courtside
tickets for Friday's game?

121
00:07:55,262 --> 00:07:57,104
Why? Why would I do that?

122
00:07:57,763 --> 00:07:59,214
I just fixed your car.

123
00:07:59,214 --> 00:08:01,620
You fixed nothing,
you looked at it.

124
00:08:01,622 --> 00:08:02,406
I looked right at it!

125
00:08:02,408 --> 00:08:03,027
That-- you know--

126
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:03,623
And it works.

127
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,392
Looking at it counts
for nothing, sorry.

128
00:08:05,394 --> 00:08:06,340
I'm a Jedi.

129
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,388
No, you can do that on your own dime.
You did nothing but look.

130
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,182
Whatev. How'd, uh,
move-in day go?

131
00:08:14,184 --> 00:08:18,279
Good, went well. Except for
me having to convince her

132
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:20,604
that I'm actually happy
about her moving back.

133
00:08:21,955 --> 00:08:22,880
Ouch.

134
00:08:24,191 --> 00:08:24,955
What?

135
00:08:25,285 --> 00:08:27,051
You got that girl's number
at the park, didn't you?

136
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:28,818
What? No.

137
00:08:29,331 --> 00:08:30,037
Ben?

138
00:08:30,456 --> 00:08:30,967
What?

139
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,014
I'm gonna tell your mother.

140
00:08:32,535 --> 00:08:34,829
I've met her, I've met
your mom, she loves me.

141
00:08:34,831 --> 00:08:36,175
She'll believe anything I say.

142
00:08:36,175 --> 00:08:38,225
There's nothing to tell.
I didn't get her number.

143
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:40,884
I'm--I'm a happily
girlfriended man.

144
00:08:40,884 --> 00:08:42,866
You talked to her for
five solid minutes.

145
00:08:42,868 --> 00:08:44,402
I'm sure she was just hideous.

146
00:08:44,404 --> 00:08:45,395
I don't know.

147
00:08:45,395 --> 00:08:46,254
A beast.

148
00:08:46,488 --> 00:08:47,957
She very well could have been.

149
00:08:48,348 --> 00:08:50,333
Could have looked like
you for all I know.

150
00:08:50,335 --> 00:08:51,418
You wish.

151
00:08:52,077 --> 00:08:54,581
Oh, dude, did you show
her the magic trick?

152
00:08:54,581 --> 00:08:57,321
No, I did not try the magic trick.
I don't care--

153
00:08:57,323 --> 00:08:57,861
Why not?

154
00:08:57,863 --> 00:08:59,768
I don't care if it works.
I'm not doing--I'm not--

155
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:00,697
It always works.

156
00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:02,113
I'm not becoming that guy.

157
00:09:02,113 --> 00:09:03,146
It works every time.

158
00:09:03,146 --> 00:09:04,123
What works?

159
00:09:05,681 --> 00:09:06,324
Start it?

160
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,051
Uh, yeah, seems to be.

161
00:09:11,838 --> 00:09:13,785
It was working just fine
until you showed up.

162
00:09:15,832 --> 00:09:16,928
Good to know.

163
00:09:17,563 --> 00:09:19,217
So you'll take it in tomorrow?

164
00:09:19,219 --> 00:09:22,188
I still don't know why you didn't just call
me for a ride to work, man, I'm like--

165
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,398
How are you gonna
give me a ride?

166
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,149
You barely fit on your moped.

167
00:09:25,151 --> 00:09:27,839
Okay, Amy, you're
obviously bad luck.

168
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,981
Get 50 feet from the premises.

169
00:09:29,981 --> 00:09:30,682
Ben,

170
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:33,908
let's start this car. We
can do this, go team.

171
00:09:33,918 --> 00:09:34,980
Okay.

172
00:09:57,933 --> 00:09:59,700
You don't deserve this bike.

173
00:09:59,906 --> 00:10:01,576
Someone should take this
bike away from you.

174
00:10:01,578 --> 00:10:02,267
Hey!

175
00:10:05,222 --> 00:10:07,250
Uh.

176
00:10:07,252 --> 00:10:08,033
You okay?

177
00:10:10,355 --> 00:10:12,646
Uh, um, I'm okay.

178
00:10:13,782 --> 00:10:18,728
Well, you know, I'm pretty good at making
people forget about their bad dreams.

179
00:10:19,341 --> 00:10:20,409
Really?

180
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,075
Mm-hmm.

181
00:10:21,077 --> 00:10:23,156
What is that-- is
that your superpower?

182
00:10:23,158 --> 00:10:24,292
Superpower?

183
00:10:24,294 --> 00:10:27,106
Yeah, well, are you the
nightmare destroyer?

184
00:10:27,551 --> 00:10:30,089
Uh, all right, I guess.

185
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:50,080
And that happened one
time with one person.

186
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,001
That's just a stupid
thing to say.

187
00:10:52,001 --> 00:10:55,705
Okay, Tammy, let's not get back into the
affair, at least not for right now.

188
00:10:55,705 --> 00:10:58,566
What about him makes
you feel he's absent?

189
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:02,518
He doesn't look at me the
way that he used to.

190
00:11:03,314 --> 00:11:07,269
It's like he's replaying a movie
in his head or something.

191
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:08,582
I have a stressful job.

192
00:11:09,854 --> 00:11:11,206
You're a butcher!

193
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:14,314
You try carving animals up all day
and tell me it doesn't affect you!

194
00:11:16,737 --> 00:11:21,361
There was a pig yesterday
that reminded me of Harrison.

195
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:26,005
I'm sorry, um, who's Harrison?

196
00:11:26,007 --> 00:11:27,011
Cat.

197
00:11:27,013 --> 00:11:28,093
Our cat.

198
00:11:29,428 --> 00:11:31,257
May I ask something?

199
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:35,372
Uh, Tammy, when you
feel like he is absent,

200
00:11:35,372 --> 00:11:39,669
are you worried that maybe he's thinking
about the woman he had an affair with?

201
00:11:40,872 --> 00:11:42,167
I don't know, maybe.

202
00:11:42,737 --> 00:11:44,700
Maybe these issues
are connected.

203
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,845
We're gonna need some more friends
for Texas hold 'em, you know that?

204
00:12:04,847 --> 00:12:08,534
Eh. I got plenty of friends, man. They all
just think they're too cool for poker night.

205
00:12:08,536 --> 00:12:10,684
Hmm. What are they doing
that's so cool right now?

206
00:12:10,684 --> 00:12:12,950
Knowing those guys, probably
off playing tug-a-bros.

207
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,186
What is tug-a-bros?

208
00:12:14,466 --> 00:12:15,732
Oh, it's great. It's
when two dudes--

209
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,066
No! Just-- I don't
want to hear about it.

210
00:12:17,068 --> 00:12:18,466
Oh yeah, you're
married, that's right.

211
00:12:18,468 --> 00:12:20,233
I'm not marr-- I'm
not even engaged.

212
00:12:20,233 --> 00:12:22,653
You've discussed when this
is gonna happen though.

213
00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:25,362
Well, kind-kind of, yeah.

214
00:12:25,364 --> 00:12:27,037
You have a date picked out.

215
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:29,430
Yeah, well, March
of next year was--

216
00:12:29,432 --> 00:12:30,788
it was thrown around
out a little bit but--

217
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:33,446
A particular Saturday in March?

218
00:12:33,871 --> 00:12:34,696
The tenth.

219
00:12:34,698 --> 00:12:35,793
You're married, dude.

220
00:12:35,793 --> 00:12:37,575
That's good though, I'm
glad, I'm glad for you.

221
00:12:37,575 --> 00:12:38,781
I'm glad things are good.

222
00:12:42,701 --> 00:12:46,560
There's one, maybe one slight problem but
problem's maybe too strong of a word.

223
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,827
You like dudes.

224
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:48,496
No.

225
00:12:48,496 --> 00:12:49,451
Big hairy dudes.

226
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:53,439
It's, uh, the girl.

227
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:56,691
I keep having this dream
about her, like, not like--

228
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:00,749
just a dream about her, it's like the
same dream though, like, every night.

229
00:13:01,043 --> 00:13:02,530
Stop dreaming about her.

230
00:13:02,784 --> 00:13:04,286
Doesn't seem to be that easy.

231
00:13:04,934 --> 00:13:06,137
Do you love Amy?

232
00:13:07,044 --> 00:13:07,606
Yeah.

233
00:13:07,606 --> 00:13:09,483
Then quit dreaming
about park girl.

234
00:13:09,483 --> 00:13:11,514
You've been together
what, six years?

235
00:13:11,516 --> 00:13:14,108
She's gorgeous and
she is cool as hell.

236
00:13:14,108 --> 00:13:16,935
And you've got a sweet
job working for her dad.

237
00:13:16,937 --> 00:13:17,839
Just

238
00:13:17,841 --> 00:13:18,840
hold it together.

239
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,325
I will--okay, I'll
hold it together.

240
00:13:20,325 --> 00:13:21,264
Hold it together, Ben.

241
00:13:21,266 --> 00:13:23,925
I'm holding it. I'll stop, I'll
stop dreaming. Let's-- yeah.

242
00:13:23,927 --> 00:13:26,816
Okay, and checkmate.

243
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,499
It smells nice in here.

244
00:13:31,861 --> 00:13:34,361
So your grandma's cool with us
using her place as a poker den?

245
00:13:34,707 --> 00:13:36,907
She's out of town for like 3
months, I rule the roost.

246
00:13:36,907 --> 00:13:37,696
All right.

247
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:40,125
Well, fix me a vodka prune.

248
00:13:40,766 --> 00:13:42,267
I can do a vodka prune.

249
00:13:42,267 --> 00:13:43,048
Nice.

250
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:43,860
Coming right up.

251
00:13:54,087 --> 00:13:54,952
Hmmm.

252
00:14:01,021 --> 00:14:03,006
Why are you so old?

253
00:14:04,392 --> 00:14:07,454
I mean, I should have winned by
now 'cause I took your king.

254
00:14:09,627 --> 00:14:11,046
Honk, honk.

255
00:14:12,015 --> 00:14:14,975
Honk, honk.

256
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,569
Hey. I know you.

257
00:14:38,571 --> 00:14:40,267
Yes, wow.

258
00:14:40,269 --> 00:14:41,746
Hi.

259
00:14:42,135 --> 00:14:43,119
Hi.

260
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:45,231
How's your knee?

261
00:14:45,619 --> 00:14:47,731
What? Oh, my knee, it's fine.
Yeah.

262
00:14:48,509 --> 00:14:49,645
I assumed it gave out again

263
00:14:49,647 --> 00:14:51,714
and you spent the last few
months in a cast or something.

264
00:14:51,714 --> 00:14:55,450
Yeah. I did, it's been brutal.
Do you live around here?

265
00:14:55,452 --> 00:14:57,634
No. Actually I just
moved up to Sacramento.

266
00:14:57,885 --> 00:15:00,947
Oh, so what are you--
what are you doing here?

267
00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:03,149
I guess that is kind
of weird, isn't it?

268
00:15:03,151 --> 00:15:04,588
I guess I jogged like 300 miles.

269
00:15:04,588 --> 00:15:08,659
Okay. Oh, well, as
confusing as that is,

270
00:15:08,661 --> 00:15:11,659
it's, uh, it's good to
see you again in person.

271
00:15:13,508 --> 00:15:15,790
Usually it's through long
lens photography... ?

272
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,156
Yeah. No, I--um--

273
00:15:18,158 --> 00:15:19,110
This is gonna sound stupid.

274
00:15:19,112 --> 00:15:21,899
No, no, you can sound stupid in front
of me, I'm basically a stranger.

275
00:15:22,712 --> 00:15:26,027
Okay. Uh, well, I've just have
been having this recurring dream

276
00:15:26,027 --> 00:15:28,448
where you're shooting
hoops in the park.

277
00:15:29,013 --> 00:15:32,137
So I mean, I don't
know why, it's just--

278
00:15:32,137 --> 00:15:34,102
it's weird I know, we
just met the one time

279
00:15:34,104 --> 00:15:37,291
but I'm sure the trauma of like
a bike accident, you know,

280
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:40,294
and being laughed at by a pretty
girl which was fine but...

281
00:15:41,293 --> 00:15:41,888
Hello?

282
00:15:42,661 --> 00:15:44,387
Oh, no, I'm coming
now, I'm sorry.

283
00:15:47,303 --> 00:15:49,385
Uh, I'll be there
in like 10 minutes.

284
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,048
I know.

285
00:15:52,817 --> 00:15:54,651
I'm just going for a
jog, I ended up in L.A.

286
00:15:56,697 --> 00:15:58,292
Okay, well, what time are
you gonna get there?

287
00:16:01,181 --> 00:16:04,134
Hey, next time, you let
him steal your bike.

288
00:16:07,807 --> 00:16:10,494
Who's that? Ben, who is that?

289
00:16:10,496 --> 00:16:11,236
Ben?

290
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:12,248
What?

291
00:16:12,248 --> 00:16:13,056
You're up.

292
00:16:13,731 --> 00:16:15,435
Forgot you gave me a key?

293
00:16:15,437 --> 00:16:18,141
Good thing you didn't have
some hussy in your bed, huh?

294
00:16:19,364 --> 00:16:19,973
Yeah.

295
00:16:19,975 --> 00:16:22,705
I made breakfast,
blueberry pancakes.

296
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:26,171
Oh, I have pancake stuff?

297
00:16:26,171 --> 00:16:27,937
Well, I brought the blueberries.

298
00:16:27,939 --> 00:16:31,405
I figured if you're taking me to a fancy
restaurant, I should make you breakfast.

299
00:16:36,765 --> 00:16:42,983
Yeah, what's the difference
between Zopiclone and Drixoral?

300
00:17:37,045 --> 00:17:41,592
Hello, just thought you might be a girl that
gave me her number in a dream last night.

301
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:44,023
Sorry to bother you, sir.

302
00:17:45,057 --> 00:17:46,188
No, I'm not insane.

303
00:17:47,478 --> 00:17:48,798
Have a nice day.

304
00:17:53,889 --> 00:17:54,840
Ah, screw it.

305
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:02,315
Hi, this is Nadia.

306
00:18:02,317 --> 00:18:04,260
Please leave a mess--

307
00:18:32,915 --> 00:18:36,002
Perfect timing. Oh, my God.

308
00:18:36,004 --> 00:18:36,806
I saw that.

309
00:18:36,808 --> 00:18:37,531
No, you didn't.

310
00:18:37,531 --> 00:18:40,105
Yeah. We're meeting here
so you can propose?

311
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,824
Yeah--not here, here, like in the
restaurant for lunch, here as a surprise.

312
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:47,542
I'm sorry.

313
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:49,074
I'm totally blowing it.

314
00:18:49,074 --> 00:18:52,405
I mean, I was kind of expecting it
anyway, but this is really blowing it.

315
00:18:52,407 --> 00:18:55,185
It's fine. Let-- we-- just-- we
can forget this ever happened,

316
00:18:55,185 --> 00:18:59,683
we can just-- we can have lunch or
talk and another time we'll do this.

317
00:18:59,683 --> 00:19:01,551
You're so flustered.

318
00:19:01,553 --> 00:19:05,860
Of course I'm flustered, you
caught me, you saw the box.

319
00:19:07,407 --> 00:19:09,199
Now you're gonna have to
act surprised in there.

320
00:19:09,199 --> 00:19:10,337
Well, then just do
it some other time.

321
00:19:10,339 --> 00:19:12,728
Well, now you're gonna know, you're gonna
like expect it if I take you anywhere.

322
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:13,700
No, I won't.

323
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:17,714
You will if I bend down to tie my
shoe or something, you'll freak out.

324
00:19:17,714 --> 00:19:18,796
Then just do it now.

325
00:19:20,103 --> 00:19:21,279
What, just-- what here?

326
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,115
Yeah.

327
00:19:22,115 --> 00:19:25,991
This is gross, this--there's a trash can.
It's not very romantic.

328
00:19:26,897 --> 00:19:30,460
Really, I don't care, I just
want to see the ring now.

329
00:19:31,318 --> 00:19:32,289
-Really?
-Yeah.

330
00:19:33,948 --> 00:19:35,187
What are you doing?

331
00:19:35,189 --> 00:19:35,531
What?

332
00:19:35,533 --> 00:19:37,007
You can't just whip it out!

333
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,646
Oh, right. Of course, sorry.
Okay.

334
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:41,336
Um,

335
00:19:42,186 --> 00:19:43,317
all right.

336
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:48,784
Amy, the last, uh, six--

337
00:19:48,786 --> 00:19:51,883
the last six years,
um, of my, uh--

338
00:19:51,885 --> 00:19:53,088
I had this planned
out, I promise.

339
00:19:53,088 --> 00:19:54,171
It's okay.

340
00:19:54,171 --> 00:19:57,291
Um, it'll come back to me
inside, I'm sure it has to.

341
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,010
Does the concrete
hurt your knee?

342
00:19:59,012 --> 00:19:59,399
A little.

343
00:19:59,401 --> 00:19:59,875
Yeah.

344
00:19:59,877 --> 00:20:00,819
Amy, will you marry me?

345
00:20:00,821 --> 00:20:03,181
Yes, yes, yes. Oh,
my God, I love it.

346
00:20:03,183 --> 00:20:03,991
Aww.

347
00:20:16,745 --> 00:20:18,024
Yeah!

348
00:20:29,244 --> 00:20:30,464
There he is.

349
00:20:30,821 --> 00:20:31,979
Here I am.

350
00:20:36,099 --> 00:20:37,274
You're a good man.

351
00:20:37,755 --> 00:20:39,537
Well, thank you.

352
00:20:40,246 --> 00:20:43,934
Have you ever had a
really good scotch?

353
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:45,630
No.

354
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:46,516
Sit down.

355
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,865
So what do you think about
taking over my practice?

356
00:20:52,904 --> 00:20:53,601
What?

357
00:20:53,601 --> 00:20:57,822
I know I said that I thought I had a few
more years in me, but lately, I don't know.

358
00:20:58,479 --> 00:21:01,703
Well, I-I would love to, I
don't expect it or anything.

359
00:21:01,705 --> 00:21:05,099
Susan's getting antsy, she's talking
about living in Europe or something.

360
00:21:05,101 --> 00:21:07,333
I'm not there, but I
do want to travel.

361
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:10,209
Well, I'm shocked.

362
00:21:10,584 --> 00:21:13,286
You're not that shocked, you know
I've been grooming you for this.

363
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:16,396
I can't think of a better
person to hand the reins to.

364
00:21:17,148 --> 00:21:21,600
You should grow some scruff or something,
though, so people take you more seriously.

365
00:21:22,045 --> 00:21:24,261
Okay. I'll try.

366
00:21:24,739 --> 00:21:25,543
So...

367
00:21:26,726 --> 00:21:28,234
is she the girl of your dreams?

368
00:21:33,806 --> 00:21:36,755
Uh... I'm sorry. Let me...

369
00:21:43,097 --> 00:21:45,533
These freaking cell phones.

370
00:21:51,255 --> 00:21:52,067
Hello?

371
00:21:52,067 --> 00:21:53,707
Hey, I missed a call
from this number.

372
00:21:53,707 --> 00:21:59,008
Uh, this is Ben. You gave me your
number yesterday-- er, last night.

373
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,872
I did? Um...

374
00:22:01,874 --> 00:22:05,813
That's the thing. I'm not-- I'm
not exactly sure how, um...

375
00:22:06,262 --> 00:22:07,984
You know, I think you
have the wrong number.

376
00:22:16,939 --> 00:22:18,856
So let me get this straight.

377
00:22:18,858 --> 00:22:21,979
Goofy girl from the park
shows up in your dream

378
00:22:21,981 --> 00:22:23,509
and gives you her phone number,

379
00:22:23,511 --> 00:22:27,584
and you are crazy enough to remember it
and call her when you wake up today.

380
00:22:27,586 --> 00:22:28,116
Yes.

381
00:22:28,433 --> 00:22:29,147
Uh-huh.

382
00:22:29,566 --> 00:22:31,566
And you believe it was her
that answered the phone

383
00:22:31,568 --> 00:22:34,213
even though whoever that
was said she was not her.

384
00:22:35,186 --> 00:22:37,373
But her voicemail said Nadia.

385
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:37,984
Voicemail?

386
00:22:38,675 --> 00:22:41,431
'Cause voicemail is the word of God.
Remind me,

387
00:22:41,433 --> 00:22:47,257
did you not just get engaged to be married
- today - to the lovely Amy Randall?

388
00:22:47,259 --> 00:22:49,305
Yes, that was also today.

389
00:22:49,305 --> 00:22:50,775
Okay. So that's that.

390
00:22:50,775 --> 00:22:55,687
Okay. But what are the odds that I
would just randomly call a Nadia?

391
00:22:55,689 --> 00:22:57,730
No, no, no, no more dream
girl stuff, all right?

392
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,604
Just what are the odds?
What are the odds?

393
00:22:59,604 --> 00:23:02,651
In Sacramento, one in 2,500.

394
00:23:02,651 --> 00:23:07,495
But what are the odds that you would
get a stranger's correct phone number

395
00:23:07,495 --> 00:23:10,916
while you're in REM sleep and your
girlfriend's in the next room

396
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:12,339
cooking you blueberry pancakes,

397
00:23:12,339 --> 00:23:15,106
what are those odds? One in 18 million?
Maybe 19 million.

398
00:23:15,106 --> 00:23:16,126
All right, I need to stop.

399
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:19,317
I gotta-I gotta stop thinking
about her, connecting with her.

400
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:21,094
There's something about
her, man, she's like...

401
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,706
basketball and...

402
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:28,415
Ben, stop that. Did you not
get engaged to Amy today?

403
00:23:28,887 --> 00:23:29,915
It was today, yes.

404
00:23:29,915 --> 00:23:34,378
Then why are you here hanging out
with me in my grandmother's house?

405
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:40,181
Dr. Hinton.

406
00:23:40,411 --> 00:23:41,350
Hi.

407
00:23:41,352 --> 00:23:42,837
Hi, Ben.

408
00:23:43,056 --> 00:23:48,649
Um, do you have any
time to get together?

409
00:23:48,651 --> 00:23:50,184
Sure. What time?

410
00:23:50,825 --> 00:23:51,873
Like, now?

411
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,951
So do you like doing sessions
out of your house now?

412
00:23:59,953 --> 00:24:01,243
Oh, I love it, it's great.

413
00:24:01,245 --> 00:24:02,416
It's so much easier.

414
00:24:05,538 --> 00:24:06,542
Everything okay?

415
00:24:06,891 --> 00:24:10,147
Yeah, I just, uh...

416
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:12,169
There's something
kind of happening.

417
00:24:12,933 --> 00:24:15,587
It's a little different, I
guess, I just wanted to--

418
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:18,807
I thought maybe you'd be a good
person to talk to about it.

419
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:21,833
Sorry.

420
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,261
One second.

421
00:24:24,692 --> 00:24:25,852
Dr. Hinton.

422
00:24:27,331 --> 00:24:28,802
Eddie, are you all right?

423
00:24:30,507 --> 00:24:32,164
Are you having a hallucination?

424
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:33,877
Do
you want me to call 911?

425
00:24:34,283 --> 00:24:36,597
Listen to me, I want
you to do me a favor.

426
00:24:36,597 --> 00:24:39,317
I want you to sit down,
take a deep breath.

427
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:42,783
And we've talked about
this before, Eddie.

428
00:24:44,258 --> 00:24:48,628
They're not real. Do you think you're
gonna be able to make your 4 o'clock?

429
00:24:48,876 --> 00:24:52,034
'Cause I'm with a patient. All right.
You'll be okay.

430
00:24:52,052 --> 00:24:54,896
I'll see you at 4 o'clock then.
Okay, bye-bye.

431
00:24:55,105 --> 00:24:55,883
Sorry.

432
00:24:59,888 --> 00:25:03,284
If I was your patient
and a therapist...

433
00:25:05,965 --> 00:25:07,205
So?

434
00:25:07,629 --> 00:25:12,672
So I... I asked Amy
to marry me today.

435
00:25:12,674 --> 00:25:17,682
Oh! Oh, honey! Oh, that's great.
Congratulations.

436
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:18,325
Thank you.

437
00:25:18,327 --> 00:25:19,499
Well, she said yes, didn't she?

438
00:25:19,501 --> 00:25:19,937
Yeah.

439
00:25:19,939 --> 00:25:22,078
Well, try to look excited.
Stop furrowing.

440
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,269
Sorry, that's just, you
know, it's a big day.

441
00:25:24,269 --> 00:25:29,846
Yes, it is. Oh, James
would be so proud of you.

442
00:25:30,081 --> 00:25:31,908
Oh, thanks. You think?

443
00:25:31,908 --> 00:25:35,423
Of course, of course.
I wish he was here.

444
00:25:36,078 --> 00:25:36,831
Me too.

445
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:40,755
You know he was exactly your
age when we got married?

446
00:25:41,337 --> 00:25:43,392
Re-- no, I didn't know that.

447
00:25:43,392 --> 00:25:46,817
Mm-hm. So now you finally
know what true love is.

448
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:53,245
Ooh, honey, look at this.

449
00:25:54,444 --> 00:25:56,108
The Paradise Mountain,

450
00:25:57,174 --> 00:25:59,242
a series of graceful arches

451
00:25:59,242 --> 00:26:02,407
invite you through a covered front
porch into the large main hall

452
00:26:02,409 --> 00:26:04,137
where the reception takes place.

453
00:26:04,814 --> 00:26:09,932
In the 1940s, the site was a brothel
operated by gangster Mickey Cohen.

454
00:26:11,241 --> 00:26:13,945
That was in the '40s,
gives it character.

455
00:26:14,523 --> 00:26:15,883
It's in Sacramento?

456
00:26:15,883 --> 00:26:16,256
Yeah.

457
00:26:16,258 --> 00:26:19,086
Hmm, no. I don't like that,
that's not gonna work.

458
00:26:19,086 --> 00:26:20,742
What's wrong with it?
My aunt lives there.

459
00:26:20,742 --> 00:26:24,179
Yeah, I don't know.
Sacramento, it's-- no.

460
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:27,196
"Where you getting married?"
"Sacramento", it sounds-- that's gross.

461
00:26:29,011 --> 00:26:34,571
Okay, well, we could go
somewhere more exotic.

462
00:26:35,044 --> 00:26:37,054
Yeah, I don't know,
something, it's just--

463
00:26:37,351 --> 00:26:38,757
It's like, it sounds
like a body part.

464
00:26:38,757 --> 00:26:41,290
Okay, well, we can keep looking.

465
00:27:05,587 --> 00:27:07,351
Playing horse by yourself?

466
00:27:08,991 --> 00:27:12,557
Hey, asshole, you're gonna
kill somebody with this thing.

467
00:27:26,043 --> 00:27:29,012
Seemed like that bike was just
getting you into trouble anyway.

468
00:27:31,386 --> 00:27:33,947
I guess.

469
00:27:33,949 --> 00:27:34,907
Ladies first.

470
00:27:34,909 --> 00:27:35,802
Thank you.

471
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:41,072
Oh. Nice shot.

472
00:27:41,862 --> 00:27:42,600
Thanks.

473
00:27:44,013 --> 00:27:45,667
So you're a shrink, huh?

474
00:27:46,337 --> 00:27:48,150
Yes, I am.

475
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,320
You're taking over
for Amy's dad.

476
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,835
Good luck with the new practice.

477
00:27:52,742 --> 00:27:54,058
Yeah, thanks.

478
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,430
Did you always want to do that?

479
00:27:56,098 --> 00:27:57,146
Um...

480
00:28:02,355 --> 00:28:03,384
I don't know.

481
00:28:04,463 --> 00:28:09,354
I went to the army for a few years after
high school and then realized I hated it.

482
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,730
That's cool.

483
00:28:11,075 --> 00:28:13,141
And then just kind of
fell into psych, I guess.

484
00:28:13,904 --> 00:28:14,697
How about you?

485
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:17,109
You tell me.

486
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,146
Tell you?

487
00:28:18,148 --> 00:28:19,210
Tell me what I do.

488
00:28:20,593 --> 00:28:21,858
You're a headhunter.

489
00:28:22,299 --> 00:28:23,376
That's right.

490
00:28:23,718 --> 00:28:24,655
Sounds dangerous.

491
00:28:25,718 --> 00:28:27,828
Like hiring people
for businesses.

492
00:28:27,828 --> 00:28:28,562
Ah.

493
00:28:28,564 --> 00:28:32,519
Although I could take someone out too
if you need it. For the right price.

494
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:40,048
So why did you say I had the
wrong number when I called you?

495
00:28:42,548 --> 00:28:45,189
Well, my boyfriend
was next to me.

496
00:28:55,938 --> 00:28:57,778
You're engaged, aren't you?

497
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:00,348
Yeah.

498
00:29:01,563 --> 00:29:02,363
I am.

499
00:29:07,157 --> 00:29:09,547
So how do we know these
things about each other?

500
00:29:11,322 --> 00:29:13,109
You don't see the pattern here?

501
00:29:14,208 --> 00:29:16,313
You're not even here right now.

502
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,158
This bike sucks.

503
00:29:22,623 --> 00:29:25,267
Is Amy keeping you up at night?

504
00:29:26,603 --> 00:29:27,745
Don't answer that.

505
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:41,643
Okay. All right, well...

506
00:29:42,421 --> 00:29:43,754
I'll call.

507
00:29:45,969 --> 00:29:48,211
Yes, I'm not gonna call.

508
00:29:49,251 --> 00:29:50,454
Okay, I'll call.

509
00:29:52,934 --> 00:29:53,808
Hello.

510
00:29:54,605 --> 00:29:55,700
Oh, hello.

511
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,605
What are you doing?

512
00:29:57,605 --> 00:30:01,836
Uh, just kind of standing here
wondering what the hell is going on.

513
00:30:01,838 --> 00:30:02,569
How about you?

514
00:30:02,571 --> 00:30:04,933
Pretty much the
exact same thing.

515
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:06,566
So that was...

516
00:30:06,568 --> 00:30:08,534
So that was you, you were
there just a few minutes ago.

517
00:30:08,536 --> 00:30:10,215
Playing horse with you, yeah.

518
00:30:10,511 --> 00:30:11,999
And the guy tried
to steal my bike.

519
00:30:12,001 --> 00:30:13,429
But you let him this time.

520
00:30:13,431 --> 00:30:15,542
Right, so you've dreamed times
where I didn't let him?

521
00:30:15,544 --> 00:30:16,351
Every night.

522
00:30:16,353 --> 00:30:18,857
How is this happening? I
don't-- I don't understand.

523
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:23,560
I don't know. I gave you my number
in a dream and then you called me.

524
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:27,224
So where are you? Can we,
like, meet up or something?

525
00:30:27,226 --> 00:30:29,796
Well, I just moved to
Sacramento, remember?

526
00:30:29,796 --> 00:30:33,528
Oh, right. I was hoping
that part was just me.

527
00:30:34,804 --> 00:30:35,778
I have to go.

528
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,293
Sure, uh, all right...

529
00:30:44,081 --> 00:30:47,376
Those candles are
quite expensive.

530
00:30:47,378 --> 00:30:50,384
You would not believe if I
told you what they cost.

531
00:30:51,498 --> 00:30:53,435
So when's everybody
else getting here?

532
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,855
Funny you should ask.

533
00:30:55,857 --> 00:30:57,765
I'm very good at magic.

534
00:30:58,058 --> 00:31:00,919
Yeah, I could probably blow
your mind with a trick or two.

535
00:31:02,605 --> 00:31:04,216
All right, show me one.

536
00:31:04,218 --> 00:31:06,482
Hold out your hands.

537
00:31:15,918 --> 00:31:18,534
Your taste in décor is...

538
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,720
interesting.

539
00:31:21,174 --> 00:31:24,187
Well, I'm an old soul.

540
00:31:26,201 --> 00:31:26,828
Now

541
00:31:28,034 --> 00:31:31,095
I want you to concentrate
very intensely

542
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:34,214
on how many hands you have.

543
00:31:36,391 --> 00:31:38,125
It should still be two.

544
00:31:38,922 --> 00:31:39,970
Should it?

545
00:31:41,416 --> 00:31:42,850
Uh,

546
00:31:42,852 --> 00:31:45,034
one second, this isn't over.

547
00:31:50,064 --> 00:31:52,828
Give me a second to, uh,
take care of something.

548
00:31:53,467 --> 00:31:59,628
Don't you dare. I'm
about to put on

549
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:03,066
a closing move

550
00:32:03,069 --> 00:32:08,218
and you are ruining my life.

551
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,575
Love, Mark.

552
00:32:11,892 --> 00:32:13,911
Yeah, that's all taken care of.

553
00:32:13,913 --> 00:32:16,100
Now where were we?

554
00:32:17,328 --> 00:32:20,640
Mark! Mark, it was-- It was her.

555
00:32:20,642 --> 00:32:21,646
Come on in.

556
00:32:21,646 --> 00:32:24,158
It's her, it was her number. She's
in the dreams, she's like with me.

557
00:32:24,158 --> 00:32:26,383
We're like connected, like
we read each other's minds

558
00:32:26,393 --> 00:32:28,875
in the dream. Like I know stuff about
her and she knows stuff about me.

559
00:32:28,875 --> 00:32:30,681
This is Amanda, by the way.

560
00:32:31,427 --> 00:32:33,925
Oh, hi. I'm Ben.

561
00:32:36,063 --> 00:32:38,506
But, so I called her
and it was her number

562
00:32:38,508 --> 00:32:40,762
but she said it wasn't 'cause
her boyfriend was there.

563
00:32:41,851 --> 00:32:44,466
Uh, I have an idea.

564
00:32:44,468 --> 00:32:46,368
You should go call your fiancée.

565
00:32:49,625 --> 00:32:50,333
Yeah.

566
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:52,782
Yeah.

567
00:32:53,127 --> 00:32:54,133
That's-- okay.

568
00:32:55,461 --> 00:32:57,532
It was nice meeting you.

569
00:32:58,532 --> 00:33:01,645
Just wanted you to know it is
her number, so I'm not crazy.

570
00:33:01,645 --> 00:33:03,423
Clearly.

571
00:33:03,658 --> 00:33:05,142
Have a nice...

572
00:33:05,152 --> 00:33:05,838
candles.

573
00:33:08,462 --> 00:33:10,478
He's a sweetheart.

574
00:33:11,328 --> 00:33:12,969
Isn't he the therapist?

575
00:33:13,218 --> 00:33:14,468
Yeah, and he's quite good.

576
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,360
Oh, these are beautiful.

577
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,142
Thank you. You know, I
really love what I do.

578
00:33:21,142 --> 00:33:22,844
Oh, that's great.

579
00:33:23,931 --> 00:33:27,424
So is it just you or is it like
you have a crew of photographers?

580
00:33:27,426 --> 00:33:28,767
Well, we have different
photographers

581
00:33:28,769 --> 00:33:31,279
that will follow the bride
and some for the groom,

582
00:33:31,281 --> 00:33:33,141
just really depends
on what you want,

583
00:33:33,141 --> 00:33:35,504
how many people you have,
you know, certain--

584
00:33:37,797 --> 00:33:38,828
Who's that?

585
00:33:39,166 --> 00:33:40,668
I don't know. I'll see.

586
00:33:41,685 --> 00:33:42,216
Sorry.

587
00:33:42,218 --> 00:33:43,313
No, don't worry about it.

588
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:45,376
But we have different
packages you can choose from

589
00:33:45,376 --> 00:33:48,628
but you know you can't put a price tag
on the most special day of your life.

590
00:33:49,422 --> 00:33:50,882
You're way too pretty for that.

591
00:33:55,813 --> 00:33:56,953
Hey, you got a delivery.

592
00:33:56,955 --> 00:33:58,211
Uh, yeah.

593
00:33:58,901 --> 00:34:00,083
If you could just
sign right here--

594
00:34:00,085 --> 00:34:02,932
Shh, shh, yeah, okay. Thank you.

595
00:34:04,098 --> 00:34:05,306
Right there.

596
00:34:05,306 --> 00:34:07,418
Yeah, I just want to-- I
ordered two of these,

597
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,649
I just want to make sure
I ordered the right--

598
00:34:08,649 --> 00:34:10,278
Yeah, this is the-- Okay.

599
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,289
Dream suppressors, this
is the right one, cool.

600
00:34:12,741 --> 00:34:14,462
Wait, if I just
suppress my dreams--

601
00:34:15,274 --> 00:34:16,563
No, I need to control my dreams,

602
00:34:16,565 --> 00:34:20,523
I need to dream about driving a Ferrari
or hanging out at the White House

603
00:34:20,523 --> 00:34:23,800
or shooting hoops with a pro
basketball player or something, right?

604
00:34:23,802 --> 00:34:25,970
I mean, 'cause if she's
still having the dreams

605
00:34:25,972 --> 00:34:27,607
and I'm still having the dreams
and I just don't remember,

606
00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:30,428
that's not good--
This makes no sense.

607
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:32,274
No. If you could just
sign right here.

608
00:34:32,276 --> 00:34:32,933
Okay.

609
00:34:33,511 --> 00:34:35,303
I shot that in Santa Barbara.

610
00:34:35,305 --> 00:34:37,086
You know, do you
like that backlight?

611
00:34:37,768 --> 00:34:39,414
Yeah, I love
everything about that.

612
00:34:39,416 --> 00:34:41,791
It's beautiful. Yeah.

613
00:34:41,793 --> 00:34:43,311
Um, who was that?

614
00:34:43,746 --> 00:34:45,711
Oh, I don't know,
just wrong number--

615
00:34:45,711 --> 00:34:48,617
house, wrong house, it was a
delivery guy, I don't know.

616
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,912
-Okay.
-So do you do engagement photos, too?

617
00:34:50,914 --> 00:34:55,634
Absolutely. And we also love to go
to the location you're engaged at.

618
00:34:55,636 --> 00:34:57,352
Did you propose locally?

619
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,866
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah.

620
00:35:00,211 --> 00:35:02,397
Great. Where was it?

621
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:05,598
Just...

622
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,541
parking lot.

623
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,726
Yeah.

624
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:13,243
You know these photos are also
from Santa Barbara as well.

625
00:35:13,245 --> 00:35:13,719
Yeah.

626
00:35:13,721 --> 00:35:15,755
And there's a little different
lighting but if you...

627
00:35:15,757 --> 00:35:20,424
Germany came out of
the League of Nations in 1933.

628
00:35:20,426 --> 00:35:22,818
Hitler began to
systematically undermine

629
00:35:22,818 --> 00:35:26,116
and eradicate the provisions
of the Versailles treaty,

630
00:35:26,116 --> 00:35:30,428
the disarmament clauses and
been long since abandoned

631
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:32,725
and Hitler achieved
a minor victory

632
00:35:32,725 --> 00:35:35,605
and he withdrew Germany from
the League of Nations--

633
00:35:39,169 --> 00:35:39,997
No.

634
00:35:48,852 --> 00:35:51,147
You know, we could
meet in other places.

635
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,930
Or do you just love
parks and fields?

636
00:35:53,801 --> 00:35:55,787
I kept thinking it was you
that must be into them.

637
00:35:57,994 --> 00:35:59,006
Whatcha reading?

638
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:02,367
An encyclopedia, I guess.

639
00:36:03,038 --> 00:36:04,602
Reading about Nazis?

640
00:36:04,602 --> 00:36:05,569
Apparently.

641
00:36:05,571 --> 00:36:08,032
Okay. That's pleasant.

642
00:36:09,929 --> 00:36:11,813
I do like the letter N though.

643
00:36:13,189 --> 00:36:14,162
Nadia.

644
00:36:14,162 --> 00:36:15,976
Nad--hmm, let me read that.

645
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:18,104
Nadia,

646
00:36:18,106 --> 00:36:21,356
a strange girl that haunts your dreams.
May be armed and dangerous.

647
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:22,359
It doesn't say that!

648
00:36:22,361 --> 00:36:23,335
It does.

649
00:36:23,988 --> 00:36:26,564
All right, well, let's see
what it says about you.

650
00:36:26,564 --> 00:36:28,635
I won't be in there,
that's the N book.

651
00:36:28,637 --> 00:36:30,040
No.

652
00:36:30,042 --> 00:36:30,937
It's the B book.

653
00:36:32,095 --> 00:36:34,049
Oh, how did you do that?

654
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:42,010
Ben, cute, uncoordinated, quit the
army 'cause he couldn't take it.

655
00:36:42,516 --> 00:36:44,848
Ouch.

656
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:48,481
I didn't quit the army, I just
got out, soon as I could.

657
00:36:48,489 --> 00:36:49,642
That's right.

658
00:36:51,483 --> 00:36:53,298
So how do we know things
about each other?

659
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:55,842
'Cause we're here.

660
00:36:56,689 --> 00:36:59,457
Where is here, exactly?

661
00:37:05,619 --> 00:37:07,205
I know you.

662
00:37:09,691 --> 00:37:11,635
I've always known you.

663
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,956
Did you ever dream
about me as a kid?

664
00:37:17,536 --> 00:37:18,250
Yeah,

665
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:20,517
I did. I always
wondered who you were.

666
00:37:20,798 --> 00:37:23,669
We used to run
around on the beach,

667
00:37:23,671 --> 00:37:26,268
in the woods, at the playground.

668
00:37:27,338 --> 00:37:29,565
Did we take over a
mini golf course?

669
00:37:29,567 --> 00:37:31,374
Yes. We were, like, 10.

670
00:37:31,376 --> 00:37:34,615
We stormed it and we took it over,
we had giant clubs and swords.

671
00:37:34,617 --> 00:37:37,284
All of a sudden there was a moat
around it and nobody could get in.

672
00:37:38,549 --> 00:37:40,267
We ran that joint.

673
00:37:40,641 --> 00:37:41,645
We did.

674
00:37:42,178 --> 00:37:43,411
How did it end?

675
00:37:45,459 --> 00:37:49,457
I don't remember. I assume lots
of mini golf happened, but...

676
00:37:51,721 --> 00:37:53,253
I wonder how this is gonna end.

677
00:37:59,414 --> 00:38:01,104
Are those your dog
tags from the army?

678
00:38:02,536 --> 00:38:03,744
Oh,

679
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:05,562
yeah, they are.

680
00:38:07,223 --> 00:38:09,662
You've never done this with
anyone else before, have you?

681
00:38:10,473 --> 00:38:11,592
No.

682
00:38:11,594 --> 00:38:13,111
This is new.

683
00:38:13,113 --> 00:38:14,053
Trust me.

684
00:38:20,755 --> 00:38:24,641
Eight, nine, ten, eleven...

685
00:38:24,643 --> 00:38:25,598
That's you.

686
00:38:27,566 --> 00:38:28,601
Yeah.

687
00:38:31,705 --> 00:38:33,395
This was my backyard growing up.

688
00:38:33,835 --> 00:38:37,959
Twenty. Ready or
not, here I come.

689
00:38:40,903 --> 00:38:42,093
Oh, yeah.

690
00:38:43,198 --> 00:38:44,607
He ditched me.

691
00:38:44,816 --> 00:38:45,392
Who?

692
00:38:45,394 --> 00:38:46,456
My brother.

693
00:38:47,317 --> 00:38:49,987
He locked me out for a
long time and I cried.

694
00:38:49,989 --> 00:38:51,620
I'm sorry.

695
00:38:51,622 --> 00:38:52,818
It's all right.

696
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,184
Show me something.

697
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:07,586
This works.

698
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:11,176
Is this where you grew up?

699
00:39:11,178 --> 00:39:12,100
Yeah, it is.

700
00:39:12,566 --> 00:39:14,753
Do we get to find a
little you in there, too?

701
00:39:14,956 --> 00:39:15,847
I guess.

702
00:39:16,673 --> 00:39:17,631
Come on.

703
00:39:20,711 --> 00:39:23,397
The other dinosaurs eat
this one because it--

704
00:39:23,618 --> 00:39:26,464
because it looks like waffles.

705
00:39:28,646 --> 00:39:30,451
Oh, you're adorable.

706
00:39:31,363 --> 00:39:33,188
Just like I remember you.

707
00:39:33,787 --> 00:39:35,291
You really loved him.

708
00:39:35,601 --> 00:39:36,461
Yeah.

709
00:39:42,892 --> 00:39:44,234
I'm sorry.

710
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:47,370
You lost him.

711
00:39:47,756 --> 00:39:48,835
Yeah.

712
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:56,136
You wanted to serve like he did.

713
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,055
I didn't realize that when I,

714
00:39:59,366 --> 00:40:02,443
when I said that you couldn't take it.
I-- I hadn't seen it.

715
00:40:03,319 --> 00:40:04,907
That's okay.

716
00:40:06,438 --> 00:40:08,136
C-can we go somewhere else?

717
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:11,243
Yeah.

718
00:40:33,106 --> 00:40:33,907
Thanks.

719
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,599
You're welcome.

720
00:40:43,393 --> 00:40:45,761
I wonder what's in our picnic.

721
00:40:45,771 --> 00:40:47,066
You want some?

722
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,819
I don't know, I feel like
we're gonna get busted.

723
00:40:50,226 --> 00:40:51,585
Busted?

724
00:40:52,086 --> 00:40:54,022
Yeah, we're both
in relationships.

725
00:40:55,224 --> 00:40:57,852
This is a dream, remember?
We're asleep.

726
00:40:57,854 --> 00:40:59,552
Don't say that.

727
00:41:00,993 --> 00:41:02,557
What's wrong?

728
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:05,272
Last time you said that things
unraveled and I woke up.

729
00:41:06,229 --> 00:41:07,182
Uh-oh.

730
00:41:09,001 --> 00:41:10,694
You better kiss me.

731
00:41:10,696 --> 00:41:11,490
Yeah.

732
00:41:13,694 --> 00:41:14,895
Why haven't you?

733
00:41:15,635 --> 00:41:18,886
'Cause I know when I do that,
there's no going back.

734
00:41:20,538 --> 00:41:21,665
No, no.

735
00:41:21,665 --> 00:41:22,864
-Come on, Ben.
-Stop.

736
00:41:22,866 --> 00:41:24,342
Remember when I showed
you this at camp?

737
00:41:24,344 --> 00:41:25,231
No, no, no, no.

738
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:26,219
It's your favorite magic trick.

739
00:41:26,221 --> 00:41:26,995
No, stop.

740
00:41:29,458 --> 00:41:30,882
Where did you go?

741
00:41:32,048 --> 00:41:32,711
Sorry.

742
00:42:19,169 --> 00:42:20,965
How's this even possible?

743
00:42:21,527 --> 00:42:22,834
I don't know.

744
00:42:22,845 --> 00:42:24,331
We only met once.

745
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:25,750
I need to see you.

746
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:27,698
Ben,

747
00:42:28,476 --> 00:42:29,331
I don't think--

748
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:33,223
I know, I just-- I feel like, I just
need to see you once more, in person.

749
00:42:33,225 --> 00:42:35,253
Why? You're engaged.

750
00:42:36,072 --> 00:42:38,847
I don't know, there's got
to be some reason for this.

751
00:42:39,232 --> 00:42:41,505
You need to live your life, Ben.

752
00:42:41,507 --> 00:42:42,687
I have a life too.

753
00:42:42,689 --> 00:42:46,130
Whatever this is, I'm sure it'll pass
and we'll just be able to move on.

754
00:42:46,707 --> 00:42:48,569
All right, well, I gotta
get back to work.

755
00:42:48,569 --> 00:42:49,553
Okay.

756
00:42:50,506 --> 00:42:52,053
All right, I guess
I'll talk to you...

757
00:42:52,055 --> 00:42:54,180
I don't know if we should
keep talking on the phone.

758
00:43:04,794 --> 00:43:06,972
Hey, Harry Wendell has
agreed to do the one on one,

759
00:43:06,972 --> 00:43:08,788
he's coming in at 3:00.
You good with that?

760
00:43:10,256 --> 00:43:12,536
I'm a leader at my job.
I have to do things,

761
00:43:12,536 --> 00:43:16,347
I've got people who look up to me,
I have a reputation to uphold.

762
00:43:17,042 --> 00:43:17,931
Sure, well.

763
00:43:18,422 --> 00:43:21,626
Just tell yourself I'd like to do
things well but I don't have to.

764
00:43:22,209 --> 00:43:22,988
Okay.

765
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,300
Try saying it.

766
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,301
I'd like to do things
well but I don't have to.

767
00:43:29,715 --> 00:43:32,234
How do you feel
when you say that?

768
00:43:32,236 --> 00:43:33,400
Still feel like I have to.

769
00:43:35,567 --> 00:43:38,113
Well, let's say if you lost
your reputation, then what?

770
00:43:38,113 --> 00:43:39,958
I'd like to keep it.

771
00:43:40,347 --> 00:43:41,481
Sure, but

772
00:43:42,092 --> 00:43:43,775
is that needed for your success?

773
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,136
I suppose.

774
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:47,771
What makes you successful?

775
00:43:48,411 --> 00:43:49,519
Me?

776
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:51,798
Yeah, I mean, is it
your job, your wife?

777
00:43:52,723 --> 00:43:53,613
Fiancée.

778
00:43:53,883 --> 00:43:55,137
Fiancée.

779
00:43:56,407 --> 00:43:58,264
Is it 'cause of the gig here?
The old man?

780
00:43:58,274 --> 00:43:59,580
No.

781
00:43:59,582 --> 00:44:00,898
How do you know she's the one?

782
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,071
Umm.

783
00:44:02,073 --> 00:44:03,330
Okay, let's--

784
00:44:03,759 --> 00:44:06,735
I want to get back. Let's
not waste your hour.

785
00:44:06,737 --> 00:44:08,347
All right, fine.

786
00:44:08,347 --> 00:44:09,980
Have you gotten in
touch with your mom?

787
00:44:09,982 --> 00:44:10,608
No.

788
00:44:12,057 --> 00:44:15,724
Hi, sorry. I just have to grab...
one thing...

789
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,963
Oh, hey, we were just talking
about your daughter.

790
00:44:19,521 --> 00:44:20,852
No, not really.

791
00:44:20,852 --> 00:44:24,383
Yeah, really, we were. That's
all we've been talking about.

792
00:44:24,383 --> 00:44:27,259
That is a half truth.
We touched on...

793
00:44:27,259 --> 00:44:29,241
Yeah, he certainly touched
on your daughter.

794
00:44:31,304 --> 00:44:33,803
Well, it's not my session.

795
00:44:39,334 --> 00:44:40,773
So are you doing this
for college credit

796
00:44:40,775 --> 00:44:43,537
or you just always dreamt of
being a second rate therapist?

797
00:44:46,836 --> 00:44:48,362
Okay, I...

798
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,053
I need to tell you something.

799
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:53,900
I want to be married.

800
00:44:54,606 --> 00:44:55,217
I...

801
00:44:56,255 --> 00:44:57,442
I love you, Amy.

802
00:44:58,485 --> 00:44:59,922
It's not my fault, I just--

803
00:44:59,924 --> 00:45:01,873
I didn't choose this.
I just-- I-I dream.

804
00:45:01,873 --> 00:45:03,985
I can't control my dreams.
You've been...

805
00:45:05,925 --> 00:45:07,064
my partner.

806
00:45:07,844 --> 00:45:15,670
She'll be cool 'cause she loves you and
she'll understand and she'll kill you.

807
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:22,339
Mark's a good friend of mine,
so I won't charge you much.

808
00:45:22,341 --> 00:45:24,256
Oh, cool, thanks. I
appreciate that.

809
00:45:26,178 --> 00:45:28,850
Mark said you got engaged a few months ago.
Congratulations.

810
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:31,555
I did. Thank you, yeah, it's...
great.

811
00:45:35,337 --> 00:45:36,897
So she's giving
you trouble, huh?

812
00:45:36,897 --> 00:45:40,086
No, I mean, it's not
her, it's completely me.

813
00:45:40,086 --> 00:45:43,337
She's great, I want to marry her,
I completely want to marry her.

814
00:45:43,337 --> 00:45:45,088
She's beautiful, she's
a wonderful fiancée

815
00:45:45,088 --> 00:45:47,569
but there's this thing happening
with this other girl and it's--

816
00:45:47,571 --> 00:45:49,818
No, no, not like
hap-- not happening,

817
00:45:49,818 --> 00:45:53,208
I'm not doing stuff, it's
like, it's all in the dream.

818
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:55,163
I don't know what Mark told
you exactly but that's--

819
00:45:55,163 --> 00:45:57,914
it's completely like
that and I'm gonna stop,

820
00:45:57,916 --> 00:45:59,794
I'm gonna tell Amy everything.

821
00:45:59,796 --> 00:46:02,026
I just have to fess up and then
just like see what happens, right?

822
00:46:02,028 --> 00:46:04,608
That's what-- she's my fiancée,
I-- You would do-- do it--

823
00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:05,626
would you, would you--

824
00:46:05,628 --> 00:46:06,759
Yeah, no, so I
shouldn't, should I not?

825
00:46:06,761 --> 00:46:07,814
I shouldn't tell her.

826
00:46:08,913 --> 00:46:10,866
So she's giving
you trouble, huh?

827
00:46:13,529 --> 00:46:17,161
Yes, I think it's the starter.

828
00:46:18,519 --> 00:46:19,630
She'll do that.

829
00:46:21,607 --> 00:46:23,427
All righty, give
me half an hour.

830
00:46:23,429 --> 00:46:24,568
We'll see what we can do.

831
00:46:28,522 --> 00:46:30,498
Oh, gotta go, he's here.

832
00:46:31,071 --> 00:46:31,785
Okay.

833
00:46:32,468 --> 00:46:32,857
Bye.

834
00:46:33,677 --> 00:46:34,791
Who was that?

835
00:46:34,793 --> 00:46:37,925
I was talking about my dress which
you're not supposed to know about.

836
00:46:37,927 --> 00:46:39,380
Not that I could do it justice.

837
00:46:39,382 --> 00:46:42,192
They're expensive for a reason
and trust me, it's worth it.

838
00:46:42,522 --> 00:46:43,835
You want to know
how much it costs?

839
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,051
Not really.

840
00:46:46,051 --> 00:46:46,917
Five.

841
00:46:47,553 --> 00:46:48,567
Five, what?

842
00:46:48,567 --> 00:46:49,913
That's a lot, right?

843
00:46:49,915 --> 00:46:52,286
Well, my dad paid for it.
So it's on its way.

844
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:53,835
What, $5,000?

845
00:46:53,835 --> 00:46:56,817
Oh, and he put a deposit
down on the location today.

846
00:46:56,817 --> 00:46:59,287
It's non refundable, so
can't change our minds now.

847
00:46:59,287 --> 00:47:00,700
Non refundable?

848
00:47:00,702 --> 00:47:03,022
You said you like
the Herald Gardens

849
00:47:03,024 --> 00:47:05,398
and the deposit was
more than the dress.

850
00:47:05,787 --> 00:47:06,974
Can we go inside?

851
00:47:06,974 --> 00:47:08,537
Why? Do you need to
use the bathroom?

852
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:09,864
No.

853
00:47:09,864 --> 00:47:11,962
Okay. Well, then let's go.
I'm starving.

854
00:47:12,572 --> 00:47:14,510
Amy, I've been dreaming--

855
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:16,545
I just got a picture
of my dress.

856
00:47:16,547 --> 00:47:18,060
Oh, you can't see this.

857
00:47:18,767 --> 00:47:20,108
Amy, okay.

858
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:24,068
Look, before you or your dad spend
any more money on this wedding,

859
00:47:24,336 --> 00:47:26,450
you need to understand,
there are things

860
00:47:26,452 --> 00:47:28,053
that happen to me
that I can't control.

861
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:28,683
Ben?

862
00:47:28,685 --> 00:47:29,723
There are things...

863
00:47:29,725 --> 00:47:33,415
Ben, don't worry about
the money, okay?

864
00:47:33,415 --> 00:47:35,894
My dad is happy to
pay for everything.

865
00:47:35,896 --> 00:47:38,757
He loves me, he loves
you, he loves us.

866
00:47:39,542 --> 00:47:42,324
Every time you get close to a
big thing, you doubt yourself.

867
00:47:42,646 --> 00:47:44,304
Just believe in yourself, okay?

868
00:47:44,985 --> 00:47:47,645
I shouldn't have told you how
much the dress costs, I'm sorry.

869
00:47:49,303 --> 00:47:55,148
Okay. It's not about the dress. It's
not-it's not the deposit. It's me, okay?

870
00:47:55,148 --> 00:47:57,539
Do you want to get takeout
and go over budgets

871
00:47:57,539 --> 00:47:59,437
or do actually want
to go out with me?

872
00:48:00,241 --> 00:48:00,805
Hmm?

873
00:48:39,332 --> 00:48:40,831
You waiting for someone?

874
00:48:47,522 --> 00:48:49,767
I feel like I want to
say something but...

875
00:48:51,442 --> 00:48:56,227
it's silly, 'cause I don't even
know what this is, you know?

876
00:48:56,227 --> 00:48:57,726
You don't have to.

877
00:49:12,694 --> 00:49:14,099
Is this it?

878
00:49:15,336 --> 00:49:16,692
What do you mean?

879
00:49:17,979 --> 00:49:19,042
We...

880
00:49:19,892 --> 00:49:22,353
We can't keep doing
this forever.

881
00:49:22,355 --> 00:49:23,665
We're cheating.

882
00:49:24,799 --> 00:49:25,654
Well...

883
00:49:26,331 --> 00:49:27,446
well, no, it's not--

884
00:49:29,692 --> 00:49:32,081
It's not that simp--
I mean, we're--

885
00:49:32,684 --> 00:49:35,348
Look, I don't even-- we're not
even really here right now.

886
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:36,804
Don't say that.

887
00:49:37,216 --> 00:49:37,912
Why?

888
00:49:37,912 --> 00:49:39,425
It's gonna go away.

889
00:49:40,115 --> 00:49:41,607
It won't go away.

890
00:49:42,489 --> 00:49:44,862
We just have to keep
moving, remember?

891
00:50:06,327 --> 00:50:08,733
There's something about
the way you look at me.

892
00:50:09,197 --> 00:50:12,020
It's so full, like there's
so much behind it.

893
00:50:15,852 --> 00:50:17,200
How do I make you feel?

894
00:50:18,908 --> 00:50:19,880
Home.

895
00:50:23,333 --> 00:50:24,517
Wow.

896
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:26,376
What?

897
00:50:30,536 --> 00:50:33,629
I just-- I was expecting
a list of things, it's--

898
00:50:34,804 --> 00:50:36,225
It's perfect.

899
00:51:03,815 --> 00:51:05,912
Why don't you ever ask
me about my boyfriend?

900
00:51:06,331 --> 00:51:08,215
I like to pretend
he doesn't exist.

901
00:51:08,217 --> 00:51:09,706
This is the only
place I see you.

902
00:51:09,906 --> 00:51:11,297
What about when you get married?

903
00:51:12,427 --> 00:51:13,753
When you have kids?

904
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:16,297
Are we still gonna do be
doing this every night?

905
00:51:17,415 --> 00:51:18,462
I don't know.

906
00:51:20,097 --> 00:51:22,944
You need a clarity moment.

907
00:51:23,191 --> 00:51:25,533
That's how all big
decisions happen, right?

908
00:51:25,535 --> 00:51:26,899
My grandpa used to say that.

909
00:51:27,832 --> 00:51:29,966
Everything becomes
clear in one moment.

910
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,346
And you just know
that it's right.

911
00:51:35,158 --> 00:51:36,204
I like that.

912
00:51:37,988 --> 00:51:39,772
I need to let you go, Ben.

913
00:51:41,237 --> 00:51:42,988
What do you mean?

914
00:51:45,332 --> 00:51:47,166
I need to try to
dream alone again.

915
00:51:47,587 --> 00:51:49,214
I need to try not
to see you anymore.

916
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:52,643
W-Why? Why would you do that?

917
00:51:54,036 --> 00:51:55,169
You know why.

918
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,229
Goodbye, Ben.

919
00:52:02,705 --> 00:52:05,035
Goodbye? I don't
want to say goodbye.

920
00:52:05,037 --> 00:52:06,003
I love you.

921
00:52:09,888 --> 00:52:10,974
I love you, too.

922
00:52:10,974 --> 00:52:12,245
Don't do this.

923
00:52:20,265 --> 00:52:21,141
Nadia?

924
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:22,987
Nadia?

925
00:52:34,418 --> 00:52:36,053
I'm right-- can you see me?

926
00:52:37,911 --> 00:52:38,578
Nadia?

927
00:53:16,629 --> 00:53:18,413
Come on, Ben, where'd
you put your phone?

928
00:53:18,415 --> 00:53:19,563
Where's the phone?

929
00:53:38,073 --> 00:53:38,760
Hey.

930
00:53:39,572 --> 00:53:40,507
Is that my phone?

931
00:53:40,507 --> 00:53:41,525
Who's Nadia?

932
00:53:42,396 --> 00:53:43,100
Uh...

933
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:45,888
"I felt like I was
flying last night."

934
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:47,849
"I can still feel you."

935
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:49,148
Okay, I understand, obviously,

936
00:53:49,148 --> 00:53:51,585
it looks like I'm cheating
or something, I'm not.

937
00:53:51,585 --> 00:53:54,053
What is it then? There
are tons more in here!

938
00:53:54,053 --> 00:53:55,351
I'm not cheating on you.

939
00:53:55,353 --> 00:53:56,208
Yes, you are!

940
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:58,621
I've seen her once in
real life, that's it.

941
00:53:58,623 --> 00:54:00,849
Real life, what does
that even mean?

942
00:54:00,849 --> 00:54:03,732
She's... I can't
explain it, she's--

943
00:54:03,734 --> 00:54:04,567
Don't bother.

944
00:54:04,569 --> 00:54:05,999
It's not, uh...

945
00:54:06,001 --> 00:54:08,404
look, I'm not saying I'm
completely innocent, okay?

946
00:54:08,406 --> 00:54:09,237
I've done--

947
00:54:09,239 --> 00:54:11,565
I-- I'm not cheating on
you though, I'm not.

948
00:54:11,567 --> 00:54:14,899
Don't give me that shit.
I saw the texts!

949
00:54:15,866 --> 00:54:17,476
You're sleeping with her.

950
00:54:17,478 --> 00:54:19,320
S-sleeping? I'm not
sleeping with her.

951
00:54:19,322 --> 00:54:21,410
I've touched her one time
on the hand, that was it.

952
00:54:21,412 --> 00:54:22,796
Do you think I'm an idiot?

953
00:54:22,798 --> 00:54:26,131
I mean, I see the way you look
at me now and it's not the same.

954
00:54:26,131 --> 00:54:28,423
And I thought you were just
nervous about the wedding-

955
00:54:28,425 --> 00:54:29,060
Amy...

956
00:54:29,062 --> 00:54:30,353
-or maybe you didn't
know if you loved me.

957
00:54:30,355 --> 00:54:33,048
Amy, I-I'm telling you, I see
her when I sleep, that's it.

958
00:54:33,619 --> 00:54:36,193
You can't respect our
relationship, obviously,

959
00:54:36,193 --> 00:54:39,990
but you could at least respect me
and not treat me like I'm stupid.

960
00:54:40,645 --> 00:54:41,417
Here.

961
00:54:41,870 --> 00:54:43,363
No, you know what?

962
00:54:44,913 --> 00:54:47,849
You cheated on me, I'm taking it.
I'll sell it.

963
00:54:47,849 --> 00:54:49,343
Hey, wait, wait. Call,
call Mark, he knows.

964
00:54:49,345 --> 00:54:50,125
Don't.

965
00:55:03,911 --> 00:55:04,464
Ben?

966
00:55:04,464 --> 00:55:06,109
Mom, when I came here
before and I told you

967
00:55:06,111 --> 00:55:07,674
that I proposed to
Amy, there was more.

968
00:55:07,676 --> 00:55:09,476
I was gonna ask you something
but I didn't want to.

969
00:55:09,478 --> 00:55:11,935
I thought you would think I
was crazy or hallucinating,

970
00:55:11,935 --> 00:55:13,761
like your crazy client,
that Eddie guy.

971
00:55:13,763 --> 00:55:14,102
Okay.

972
00:55:14,104 --> 00:55:16,229
I might be crazy, I could
be, I could be hallucina--

973
00:55:16,231 --> 00:55:17,827
What do you mean? W-w-what
are you hallucinating?

974
00:55:17,827 --> 00:55:20,432
When I sleep, I dream, I connect
with-with this girl Nadia

975
00:55:20,434 --> 00:55:24,576
and I'm completely in love with her.
And we, like we don't do anything-

976
00:55:24,578 --> 00:55:25,469
-Ben...
-it's just--

977
00:55:25,471 --> 00:55:26,757
it's all-it's all in our dreams.

978
00:55:26,759 --> 00:55:29,411
And I completely deserve
what just happened to me.

979
00:55:29,413 --> 00:55:30,617
Amy just broke my phone--

980
00:55:30,619 --> 00:55:31,967
Ben, Ben, Ben, slow down.

981
00:55:31,976 --> 00:55:33,496
I'm sorry but this
is inappropriate.

982
00:55:33,498 --> 00:55:34,846
These are my office hours.

983
00:55:35,529 --> 00:55:38,230
What? Your office hour--
What are you kidding?

984
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:40,306
I'm supposed to schedule
a session with my mom?

985
00:55:40,306 --> 00:55:43,895
I may have just lost two
girls in the period of

986
00:55:44,316 --> 00:55:45,221
-this morning.
-Ben.

987
00:55:45,223 --> 00:55:46,443
-I need your help, mom.
-Benjamin!

988
00:55:50,335 --> 00:55:50,960
Hey.

989
00:55:51,629 --> 00:55:52,496
I'm Eddie.

990
00:55:58,151 --> 00:56:01,166
If you want to wait till his session
is through, then we can talk.

991
00:56:01,996 --> 00:56:04,408
No, I have to get
to work anyway.

992
00:56:05,607 --> 00:56:06,720
If I still have a job.

993
00:56:08,905 --> 00:56:09,847
Sorry.

994
00:56:46,605 --> 00:56:50,093
I didn't know if you want
me to come in today or not.

995
00:56:50,823 --> 00:56:54,416
I would have called but
my phone's broken.

996
00:56:55,955 --> 00:56:57,877
I can explain. It's
not what you think.

997
00:56:57,879 --> 00:56:59,123
Just, please leave.

998
00:57:02,029 --> 00:57:05,590
I love her. You know, I
screwed up but I do love her.

999
00:57:06,751 --> 00:57:07,876
Who?

1000
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:10,756
Who?

1001
00:57:10,758 --> 00:57:12,524
I don't know who
you're talking about.

1002
00:57:13,519 --> 00:57:16,754
Are you talking about my daughter or are
you talking about this other woman?

1003
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,740
Well, Amy, I love Amy.

1004
00:57:22,778 --> 00:57:24,100
There's that look again.

1005
00:57:25,087 --> 00:57:25,806
What look?

1006
00:57:25,808 --> 00:57:26,922
I should've seen it.

1007
00:57:27,732 --> 00:57:30,502
When I asked you if she was
the girl of your dreams...

1008
00:57:30,736 --> 00:57:32,305
Maybe it is time to retire.

1009
00:57:34,996 --> 00:57:36,432
-Look, I-I haven't--
-Just...

1010
00:57:38,886 --> 00:57:39,895
I need you to leave.

1011
00:57:44,611 --> 00:57:45,329
Thank you.

1012
00:57:45,565 --> 00:57:46,286
What?

1013
00:57:47,079 --> 00:57:50,016
That's it, just... thank you...
for everything.

1014
00:58:31,898 --> 00:58:33,461
Oh, hi.

1015
00:58:33,463 --> 00:58:34,319
Hey.

1016
00:58:35,353 --> 00:58:36,222
Thank you.

1017
00:58:36,586 --> 00:58:37,705
Will you sign right there?

1018
00:58:37,707 --> 00:58:38,491
Yeah.

1019
00:58:39,553 --> 00:58:40,923
Sorry about last
time, by the way.

1020
00:58:40,925 --> 00:58:41,367
Yeah.

1021
00:58:41,369 --> 00:58:42,923
I know what's in
these this time.

1022
00:58:42,925 --> 00:58:43,632
Good.

1023
00:58:44,381 --> 00:58:45,454
Dream suppressors?

1024
00:58:45,456 --> 00:58:47,894
No, actually, now I
want the dreams.

1025
00:58:47,967 --> 00:58:51,764
This is like some kind of sleeping
pill on steroids kind of thing,

1026
00:58:51,766 --> 00:58:53,531
like supposed to bring
on lucid dreaming.

1027
00:58:53,877 --> 00:58:56,161
That girl from before is
like blocking me out now,

1028
00:58:56,163 --> 00:58:58,531
so I'm trying to reconnect
with her in the dreams.

1029
00:58:58,533 --> 00:58:59,629
I really hope it works.

1030
00:59:00,619 --> 00:59:01,566
Sorry I asked.

1031
00:59:02,582 --> 00:59:03,502
Come on, sign it.

1032
00:59:04,677 --> 00:59:05,269
Great.

1033
00:59:05,269 --> 00:59:06,110
Thank you.

1034
00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:07,566
Thank you.

1035
00:59:25,511 --> 00:59:26,497
Can you see me?

1036
00:59:28,896 --> 00:59:30,858
Hello? Can you see me?

1037
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:36,890
I'm sure she's around
here somewhere, man.

1038
00:59:40,628 --> 00:59:42,452
Yeah, I know. I'll keep looking.

1039
00:59:42,452 --> 00:59:44,205
You don't even seem excited.
We're shooting hoops.

1040
00:59:45,991 --> 00:59:47,969
No, I... I am. Sorry.

1041
00:59:48,453 --> 00:59:51,955
You need to get a grip on reality
and ease up on the sleeping pills.

1042
00:59:52,296 --> 00:59:54,563
You know they're naming these
courts after me, right?

1043
00:59:54,967 --> 00:59:56,141
What, Nadia's courts?

1044
00:59:56,141 --> 00:59:57,594
Do I look like a Nadia?

1045
01:00:30,186 --> 01:00:33,103
Hey, Amy, it's me.

1046
01:00:33,842 --> 01:00:35,342
I miss you.

1047
01:00:37,499 --> 01:00:40,358
I don't know if you get my voicemails
but I just wanted to say hi,

1048
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:43,407
and I hope you and your
dad are doing well.

1049
01:00:44,579 --> 01:00:46,689
Uh, give me a call sometime.

1050
01:00:53,914 --> 01:00:57,006
Nadia, number 217.

1051
01:00:58,269 --> 01:01:05,027
Hi, I had dreams about
a girl, might be you.

1052
01:01:05,577 --> 01:01:10,374
And I know this sounds crazy.

1053
01:01:11,416 --> 01:01:15,407
If you are the right girl,
you will know who I am.

1054
01:01:17,113 --> 01:01:19,024
Nadia 218.

1055
01:01:20,615 --> 01:01:22,875
She's there, and then
she just disappears.

1056
01:01:23,545 --> 01:01:25,157
This is when you're
asleep though, right?

1057
01:01:25,157 --> 01:01:27,321
Yes, yes, as in my
dreams, I just--

1058
01:01:27,323 --> 01:01:29,077
I get a glimpse of
her, and she's gone.

1059
01:01:29,095 --> 01:01:30,760
Mm-hmm. You can't call her?

1060
01:01:30,762 --> 01:01:32,669
No, I don't have her number.

1061
01:01:32,671 --> 01:01:33,984
Amy destroyed my phone

1062
01:01:33,984 --> 01:01:37,658
and then by the time I looked at the
bill with Nadia's number on it,

1063
01:01:37,658 --> 01:01:39,580
she changed it or
disconnected it or something.

1064
01:01:41,789 --> 01:01:44,313
Can't do a web search
for her, you know,

1065
01:01:44,827 --> 01:01:47,753
go along look her up,
Nadia in Sacramento?

1066
01:01:47,755 --> 01:01:48,662
How many could there be?

1067
01:01:49,144 --> 01:01:50,608
2,500.

1068
01:01:51,421 --> 01:01:52,318
Right.

1069
01:01:55,628 --> 01:01:57,902
You know, you look
really tired for a dude

1070
01:01:57,904 --> 01:01:59,842
who's been dreaming for
the last few weeks.

1071
01:02:00,093 --> 01:02:01,998
Well, I haven't been
sleeping that much.

1072
01:02:02,610 --> 01:02:05,389
I was doing the sleeping pill
thing, then trying to wean myself.

1073
01:02:05,624 --> 01:02:07,907
Got insomnia most of the
time, it's a blast.

1074
01:02:07,907 --> 01:02:11,951
Ugh. I had insomnia once. I'd
watch cartoons to fall asleep.

1075
01:02:12,531 --> 01:02:14,713
You say you only met her

1076
01:02:14,715 --> 01:02:16,578
one time in real life, right?

1077
01:02:16,578 --> 01:02:17,297
Yeah.

1078
01:02:17,297 --> 01:02:19,374
How do you know that
wasn't also a dream?

1079
01:02:20,345 --> 01:02:22,426
So you're saying I just
made her up, completely.

1080
01:02:22,426 --> 01:02:24,455
I'm not saying it, but
it's like, you know,

1081
01:02:24,455 --> 01:02:27,186
if that is going to help you move
forward, then I'm saying it.

1082
01:02:27,186 --> 01:02:30,656
Okay, you know the texts from her
broke up my relationship with Amy.

1083
01:02:30,656 --> 01:02:33,093
You're saying I bought a phone
and a plan and I texted myself.

1084
01:02:33,093 --> 01:02:34,248
Well, let's hope not.

1085
01:02:34,499 --> 01:02:36,353
Could you stop it? You
do this all time.

1086
01:02:36,355 --> 01:02:38,985
I'm trying to help my
friend here, okay?

1087
01:02:38,987 --> 01:02:40,771
If he can get past
what's-her-face,

1088
01:02:40,771 --> 01:02:43,279
he could get back
together with Amy, maybe.

1089
01:02:44,541 --> 01:02:45,695
Maybe she's dead.

1090
01:02:46,361 --> 01:02:47,316
Amanda--

1091
01:02:47,316 --> 01:02:50,419
No, seriously, wait. Her
number's changed or gone.

1092
01:02:50,421 --> 01:02:52,520
She's not appearing in
his dreams anymore,

1093
01:02:52,522 --> 01:02:54,016
maybe it's because she
doesn't have a choice.

1094
01:02:54,016 --> 01:02:56,328
Maybe you're chasing a
ghost now or something.

1095
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:59,592
If she were alive, she'd
let you find her.

1096
01:02:59,994 --> 01:03:00,916
She's dead.

1097
01:03:02,619 --> 01:03:05,210
I'm sorry, that's awful.
She's alive.

1098
01:03:06,053 --> 01:03:07,120
Let's make cookies.

1099
01:03:09,915 --> 01:03:11,774
Have you had her
chocolate chips?

1100
01:03:24,791 --> 01:03:26,774
So what is it you plan on doing?

1101
01:03:26,774 --> 01:03:28,294
Wandering the streets
of Sacramento,

1102
01:03:28,294 --> 01:03:29,995
asking people if
they know a Nadia?

1103
01:03:29,997 --> 01:03:31,040
What if she's like me?

1104
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,603
What if everybody
thinks she's crazy

1105
01:03:32,603 --> 01:03:35,278
and she's only blocking me out 'cause
she thinks I'm getting married?

1106
01:03:35,278 --> 01:03:37,072
Okay, Ben, look,

1107
01:03:37,072 --> 01:03:40,981
I think Nadia is not what
we want to be focused on.

1108
01:03:40,981 --> 01:03:42,336
Okay, I don't need a
session now, mom.

1109
01:03:42,338 --> 01:03:44,090
Okay, I'm not, I'm not,

1110
01:03:44,092 --> 01:03:48,619
but we need to concentrate on who
is with us now, who is real.

1111
01:03:48,619 --> 01:03:49,808
Amy is real.

1112
01:03:50,041 --> 01:03:50,839
Amy left me.

1113
01:03:50,839 --> 01:03:52,149
Because you--

1114
01:03:53,224 --> 01:03:54,279
Sit down.

1115
01:03:55,108 --> 01:03:57,928
You were scared to get
married, that's not uncommon.

1116
01:03:58,284 --> 01:04:02,845
Commitment can be really scary but you
have come up with a dream scenario

1117
01:04:02,845 --> 01:04:04,709
that Amy cannot
possibly live up to.

1118
01:04:06,455 --> 01:04:08,144
You need to tell her the truth.

1119
01:04:09,455 --> 01:04:10,737
What is the truth?

1120
01:04:11,214 --> 01:04:14,431
Well, first you could
try telling yourself

1121
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:16,034
that you never met Nadia.

1122
01:04:16,329 --> 01:04:17,720
I did meet Nadia.

1123
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:19,221
Try saying it out loud.

1124
01:04:19,221 --> 01:04:21,109
I'm not-- I don't-- No, I
don't want to do that.

1125
01:04:21,111 --> 01:04:24,443
Ben, you know yourself, very well,
that when people vocalize something,

1126
01:04:24,445 --> 01:04:25,803
it can validate their feelings.

1127
01:04:25,805 --> 01:04:28,891
Just try it.

1128
01:04:31,934 --> 01:04:34,017
Fine. I never met Nadia.

1129
01:04:35,069 --> 01:04:38,705
And that it was all in your head
and you created it out of fear.

1130
01:04:39,707 --> 01:04:41,405
This was all in my head. I

1131
01:04:43,225 --> 01:04:44,861
created it out of fear.

1132
01:04:46,674 --> 01:04:48,424
How does that make you
feel when you say it?

1133
01:04:52,458 --> 01:04:53,908
I miss dad.

1134
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:02,172
What do you think
he would tell you?

1135
01:05:05,565 --> 01:05:07,471
You know, I made a
promise to him...

1136
01:05:08,567 --> 01:05:10,565
couple years after he was gone.

1137
01:05:11,845 --> 01:05:12,915
What was it?

1138
01:05:15,304 --> 01:05:16,296
You don't have to tell me.

1139
01:05:17,190 --> 01:05:18,909
And you don't have
to listen to me.

1140
01:05:19,879 --> 01:05:22,686
But, you went into the
army because of your dad

1141
01:05:22,696 --> 01:05:26,043
and you became a therapist, I
think, in part because of me.

1142
01:05:27,128 --> 01:05:29,307
What you need to
ask yourself is,

1143
01:05:30,284 --> 01:05:31,760
what does Ben want?

1144
01:05:33,362 --> 01:05:34,580
What do you want?

1145
01:05:46,091 --> 01:05:46,635
Hello?

1146
01:05:47,963 --> 01:05:48,849
Amy?

1147
01:05:48,851 --> 01:05:49,600
Hey.

1148
01:05:50,391 --> 01:05:51,441
Hey, what's up?

1149
01:05:52,407 --> 01:05:53,799
What are you doing?

1150
01:05:54,794 --> 01:05:55,913
Uh...

1151
01:05:58,310 --> 01:05:58,763
just...

1152
01:05:58,765 --> 01:06:02,985
Do you... Do you want to get
breakfast or something tomorrow?

1153
01:06:04,313 --> 01:06:06,251
Breakfast? Um...

1154
01:06:06,522 --> 01:06:09,172
I don't know. I'm sorry I
haven't called you back.

1155
01:06:09,174 --> 01:06:12,456
My dad said I should've let you
explain the whole dream thing.

1156
01:06:12,456 --> 01:06:14,237
Even though it sounded
completely bogus

1157
01:06:14,456 --> 01:06:16,939
and something that a
cheater would say,

1158
01:06:20,466 --> 01:06:22,216
I'd like to see you.

1159
01:06:22,218 --> 01:06:23,751
Let's just talk.

1160
01:06:23,751 --> 01:06:26,221
Yeah, yeah. Let's do that.

1161
01:06:41,423 --> 01:06:42,909
Where do you think you're going?

1162
01:06:42,909 --> 01:06:45,596
Got to meet Amy for
breakfast, I'm 3 hours late.

1163
01:06:45,598 --> 01:06:47,454
Well, your car's broke.

1164
01:06:47,456 --> 01:06:50,627
Hey, asshole, now let
me get this straight.

1165
01:06:50,627 --> 01:06:53,300
When you were trying to stop
dreaming about Nadia, you couldn't.

1166
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:56,861
She decides not to see you again
and boom, she pulls it off.

1167
01:06:57,285 --> 01:06:58,829
Yeah, basically.

1168
01:06:59,281 --> 01:07:02,365
Well, girls love to
sleep, she's good at it.

1169
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:04,456
Better than you obviously.

1170
01:07:04,456 --> 01:07:06,798
Go to Sacramento, find
her in real life.

1171
01:07:06,798 --> 01:07:10,032
She has a boyfriend, she
blocked me out for a reason.

1172
01:07:10,032 --> 01:07:11,564
She doesn't want to
be a home wrecker.

1173
01:07:12,158 --> 01:07:12,921
Right.

1174
01:07:12,923 --> 01:07:15,086
Not that there's much
of a home to wreck.

1175
01:07:15,088 --> 01:07:16,861
Amy dumped you, brutally.

1176
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:18,158
Yes, thank you.

1177
01:07:18,158 --> 01:07:20,156
So what, now you're the closest
thing I can get to Nadia?

1178
01:07:20,158 --> 01:07:21,533
The guy I almost
hit in the park?

1179
01:07:23,753 --> 01:07:27,138
You're losing in real life and you
can't even dream that your car works.

1180
01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:29,174
How about dreaming that
you win for a change?

1181
01:07:29,176 --> 01:07:30,261
I'm trying.

1182
01:07:30,263 --> 01:07:33,060
You can dream that you're shooting hoops
with a professional basketball player.

1183
01:07:33,062 --> 01:07:35,229
So dream that you find
her, that she sees you.

1184
01:07:35,231 --> 01:07:36,471
That's what I'm trying to do.

1185
01:07:36,471 --> 01:07:39,042
Try harder. What are you
sitting there with me for?

1186
01:07:39,044 --> 01:07:39,915
I don't know!

1187
01:07:39,917 --> 01:07:42,297
You probably feel bad for
almost killing us on your bike.

1188
01:07:42,297 --> 01:07:43,547
She's probably
dreaming right now.

1189
01:07:43,549 --> 01:07:45,642
Where is she? What does she see?

1190
01:07:45,644 --> 01:07:47,205
I mean, focus.

1191
01:07:47,766 --> 01:07:48,698
I don't know.

1192
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:49,956
Where is Nadia?

1193
01:07:50,408 --> 01:07:51,709
What is she looking at?

1194
01:07:51,711 --> 01:07:52,621
Where is she?

1195
01:07:53,244 --> 01:07:54,249
She's...

1196
01:07:55,105 --> 01:07:57,824
dreaming about when she
was on the phone with me.

1197
01:07:57,826 --> 01:08:00,717
I gave you my number
in a dream and, uh...

1198
01:08:01,450 --> 01:08:03,027
and you called me.

1199
01:08:04,588 --> 01:08:06,426
But your boyfriend was there?

1200
01:08:08,019 --> 01:08:08,894
Yeah.

1201
01:08:10,474 --> 01:08:14,134
So where are you? Can we
like meet up or something?

1202
01:08:17,348 --> 01:08:19,966
Well, I just moved to
Sacramento, remember?

1203
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:25,615
Oh, right. I was hoping
that part was just me.

1204
01:08:27,206 --> 01:08:28,262
Uh,

1205
01:08:29,047 --> 01:08:30,715
I have to go.

1206
01:08:30,717 --> 01:08:33,457
Well, I'd just like to see you.

1207
01:08:33,459 --> 01:08:35,938
But I guess we will.

1208
01:08:37,499 --> 01:08:38,688
I guess so.

1209
01:08:41,958 --> 01:08:44,593
Wow. Um, well...

1210
01:08:45,193 --> 01:08:46,190
Bye.

1211
01:08:56,266 --> 01:08:58,108
You're dreaming this
right now, aren't you?

1212
01:08:58,546 --> 01:09:00,019
She's remembering.

1213
01:09:01,249 --> 01:09:02,656
Quit looking at me.

1214
01:09:02,656 --> 01:09:04,668
Stop looking at me and him.

1215
01:09:04,670 --> 01:09:06,077
It's 10 o'clock.

1216
01:09:07,042 --> 01:09:08,480
What, is this thing broken?

1217
01:09:08,482 --> 01:09:10,248
I was calling you, you
weren't answering.

1218
01:09:11,657 --> 01:09:13,187
What happened to breakfast?

1219
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:15,781
Took too many sleeping pills.

1220
01:09:16,218 --> 01:09:17,874
What, are you trying
to kill yourself?

1221
01:09:18,328 --> 01:09:20,142
It's kind of weird
being back here.

1222
01:09:20,685 --> 01:09:24,032
It's like going back to an old
school you had or job or something.

1223
01:09:27,635 --> 01:09:29,845
You know, I found that
medication you bought,

1224
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:31,858
the dream suppression stuff?

1225
01:09:32,248 --> 01:09:35,219
So were you really having
weird dreams or something?

1226
01:09:39,951 --> 01:09:41,247
I'm sorry.

1227
01:09:41,249 --> 01:09:42,843
Well, that's good.

1228
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:44,750
Considering forgiving you.

1229
01:09:44,752 --> 01:09:45,786
No.

1230
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,239
You--

1231
01:09:48,731 --> 01:09:50,367
I'm sorry that

1232
01:09:50,369 --> 01:09:51,788
that you moved back here for me.

1233
01:09:52,758 --> 01:09:55,440
I'm sorry. It took me six
years to tell you this

1234
01:09:55,442 --> 01:09:57,325
but I'm not the
right guy for you.

1235
01:09:58,630 --> 01:10:00,124
I wish I was.

1236
01:10:00,517 --> 01:10:01,442
Really?

1237
01:10:02,054 --> 01:10:05,149
Could have fooled me since you've
been calling me all the time.

1238
01:10:06,561 --> 01:10:07,621
I know.

1239
01:10:07,623 --> 01:10:09,717
"Amy, I miss you.
I want to talk.

1240
01:10:09,719 --> 01:10:11,858
Why won't you just please
answer your phone?"

1241
01:10:13,921 --> 01:10:15,014
I'm sorry, look, I--

1242
01:10:15,016 --> 01:10:18,029
And now I finally wanna
talk and you're over it?

1243
01:10:19,013 --> 01:10:22,413
Okay, great. Let's be over it!

1244
01:10:28,578 --> 01:10:30,249
She broke your phone again?

1245
01:10:30,249 --> 01:10:31,783
How many times is that already?

1246
01:10:32,577 --> 01:10:34,655
I'm going to Sacramento,
I'm finding Nadia.

1247
01:10:34,655 --> 01:10:36,653
You're going all the way
to Sacramento, really?

1248
01:10:36,655 --> 01:10:38,034
How are you even
gonna find her, man?

1249
01:10:38,036 --> 01:10:40,018
Are you just gonna bang on
people's doors all day,

1250
01:10:40,018 --> 01:10:41,904
until she happens to answer?

1251
01:10:41,906 --> 01:10:42,547
I don't know, man.

1252
01:10:42,549 --> 01:10:42,928
Come on.

1253
01:10:42,930 --> 01:10:44,508
But I've been thinking about it.
I'm trying to figure out,

1254
01:10:44,510 --> 01:10:46,684
like, is Amy in my head,
is Nadia in my head?

1255
01:10:46,686 --> 01:10:48,717
Which one is in my head and my heart
and like which one to follow.

1256
01:10:48,717 --> 01:10:49,826
Maybe Nadia is both.

1257
01:10:49,826 --> 01:10:51,892
Or maybe it's Amy versus
my head and my heart,

1258
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:52,867
but

1259
01:10:53,271 --> 01:10:56,264
if this connection that I have
with Nadia is one in a million,

1260
01:10:56,264 --> 01:10:57,563
then I got to follow it, right?

1261
01:10:57,563 --> 01:10:59,952
I got to go there, I got
to follow my heart.

1262
01:10:59,954 --> 01:11:00,880
It's how it works.

1263
01:11:04,166 --> 01:11:06,012
But what if we're
not a statistic?

1264
01:11:06,014 --> 01:11:09,935
What if this is the first time
this has ever happened to anybody?

1265
01:11:11,814 --> 01:11:14,500
You know they put wheels on
that thing for a reason, right?

1266
01:11:15,018 --> 01:11:16,669
Rolls along right behind you.

1267
01:11:16,724 --> 01:11:20,158
But I know with my head that it's
completely irrational to go up there

1268
01:11:20,158 --> 01:11:21,998
'cause she has a boyfriend
and she blocked me out.

1269
01:11:22,748 --> 01:11:23,834
Good, my car is still here.

1270
01:11:23,834 --> 01:11:26,045
They were threatening
to repossess it.

1271
01:11:26,295 --> 01:11:28,827
But, it doesn't matter if Nadia
is my head or my heart--

1272
01:11:28,829 --> 01:11:30,439
Ben, stop.

1273
01:11:30,441 --> 01:11:31,922
Just wait a second, dude.

1274
01:11:33,019 --> 01:11:34,509
You don't know where
this girl lives!

1275
01:11:34,511 --> 01:11:35,689
She's got a boyfriend,

1276
01:11:35,691 --> 01:11:37,842
she said she can't
see you anymore,

1277
01:11:37,844 --> 01:11:39,600
and you're so sure
about this chick,

1278
01:11:39,602 --> 01:11:42,428
you're gonna drive
seven hours to maybe

1279
01:11:42,430 --> 01:11:44,639
find the girl of your
dreams, literally.

1280
01:11:45,116 --> 01:11:48,801
And you were about to get into
that car without giving me a hug?

1281
01:11:51,326 --> 01:11:52,282
Sorry.

1282
01:11:56,610 --> 01:11:58,899
If this boyfriend of hers has
half the connection with her

1283
01:11:58,901 --> 01:12:00,529
that you've got,
you'll still win.

1284
01:12:01,370 --> 01:12:02,206
Thanks, man.

1285
01:12:02,208 --> 01:12:03,153
I love you, buddy.

1286
01:12:03,155 --> 01:12:04,374
Love you, too.

1287
01:12:09,942 --> 01:12:12,027
Oh, that's not good.

1288
01:12:14,108 --> 01:12:15,298
Come on!

1289
01:12:21,794 --> 01:12:23,319
That's a shame.

1290
01:12:25,671 --> 01:12:26,979
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

1291
01:12:26,981 --> 01:12:29,013
I'll figure it out, man.
I'll ride, I'll hitchhike.

1292
01:12:29,015 --> 01:12:30,952
Come on, I can fix
this in 3 hours.

1293
01:12:30,952 --> 01:12:32,375
You're not a mechanic.

1294
01:12:33,485 --> 01:12:34,945
Well, at least wear a helmet.

1295
01:13:23,154 --> 01:13:24,997
Thanks again, I appreciate this.

1296
01:13:24,999 --> 01:13:27,682
Hey, no problem. You know,
hey, true love, right?

1297
01:13:27,684 --> 01:13:29,612
-Sure.
-Yeah.

1298
01:13:29,614 --> 01:13:32,211
Where should I drop you? I'll
take you right to her door.

1299
01:13:32,213 --> 01:13:35,577
Uh, I actually have no idea.

1300
01:13:35,851 --> 01:13:36,929
No idea?

1301
01:13:37,545 --> 01:13:38,418
No.

1302
01:13:39,418 --> 01:13:40,570
I'll find her.

1303
01:13:41,181 --> 01:13:42,419
I'm gonna feel it out.

1304
01:13:42,421 --> 01:13:43,628
You're just gonna feel it out?

1305
01:13:43,630 --> 01:13:45,447
Now, w-wait a minute, let
me get this straight, now.

1306
01:13:45,449 --> 01:13:47,472
You only met this
girl once in person,

1307
01:13:47,472 --> 01:13:50,088
but you-you keep
connecting in dreams

1308
01:13:50,090 --> 01:13:53,582
and talking to each other and she
gave you her cell phone number

1309
01:13:53,584 --> 01:13:57,843
and you called the number from the dream
and it worked and it was her, right?

1310
01:13:57,843 --> 01:13:58,540
Yeah.

1311
01:13:58,542 --> 01:13:59,802
H-how are you
supposed to find her?

1312
01:13:59,804 --> 01:14:01,370
Where do you want
me to take you?

1313
01:14:01,372 --> 01:14:03,956
I-I don't know how
I'm gonna find her.

1314
01:14:03,958 --> 01:14:07,483
You come to Sacramento on
a whim from Los Angeles

1315
01:14:07,485 --> 01:14:10,202
and you don't know where she lives
or where she works or anything?

1316
01:14:10,514 --> 01:14:11,685
Are you buying this?

1317
01:14:11,983 --> 01:14:13,054
I don't buy it.

1318
01:14:13,056 --> 01:14:14,462
I don't think I buy it either.

1319
01:14:15,690 --> 01:14:16,936
What's going on?

1320
01:14:19,249 --> 01:14:21,406
You got me all upset
now, just get out.

1321
01:14:22,813 --> 01:14:23,499
Get out.

1322
01:14:23,499 --> 01:14:26,141
What? I-I don't
feel like this is--

1323
01:14:26,143 --> 01:14:28,201
I don't feel like this
is the right spot.

1324
01:14:28,203 --> 01:14:30,450
Well, I feel like this is the right spot.
Am I speaking English?

1325
01:14:30,452 --> 01:14:31,203
Yes.

1326
01:14:31,205 --> 01:14:32,343
Well, then get out.

1327
01:14:32,654 --> 01:14:34,033
All right.

1328
01:14:34,536 --> 01:14:35,841
Thanks.

1329
01:14:45,505 --> 01:14:48,897
All right, Nadia, where are you?

1330
01:14:51,104 --> 01:14:52,452
Come on. Excuse me?
Do you know a Nadia?

1331
01:14:52,452 --> 01:14:53,877
Have you met a--

1332
01:15:07,482 --> 01:15:08,915
Come on.

1333
01:15:11,530 --> 01:15:12,721
Excuse me, do you know a Nadia?

1334
01:15:12,721 --> 01:15:13,908
Have you ever met-- Do you--

1335
01:15:23,812 --> 01:15:25,812
Excuse me, have you-- Do
you guys know a Nadia?

1336
01:15:25,814 --> 01:15:27,262
-No, no, no.
-No, sorry.

1337
01:15:27,264 --> 01:15:28,349
Are you guys from around here?

1338
01:15:28,351 --> 01:15:28,968
Listen, don't touch her.

1339
01:15:28,970 --> 01:15:31,009
Ow, hey, whoa, I'm just
asking a question.

1340
01:15:31,011 --> 01:15:31,716
I don't care.

1341
01:15:31,718 --> 01:15:32,567
-Sorry.
-Walk away.

1342
01:15:32,569 --> 01:15:33,354
You might have a friend named--

1343
01:15:33,356 --> 01:15:34,362
Hey, I said don't touch her.

1344
01:15:34,364 --> 01:15:35,624
Stop it, stop, stop!

1345
01:15:35,626 --> 01:15:36,750
Come on.

1346
01:16:08,973 --> 01:16:10,812
Hey, how's it going?

1347
01:16:11,699 --> 01:16:14,262
You don't know if there's a motel
or anything around here, do you?

1348
01:16:14,262 --> 01:16:17,973
Sure, actually, you go out this
way, take a right, two blocks,

1349
01:16:17,975 --> 01:16:19,411
there's a boots inn.
You can't miss it.

1350
01:16:19,413 --> 01:16:21,684
Okay. Two blocks, all right.
Well, thank you.

1351
01:16:21,686 --> 01:16:23,339
-You have good night, buddy.
-You too.

1352
01:16:26,633 --> 01:16:28,097
Great,

1353
01:16:28,099 --> 01:16:29,157
I lost my wallet.

1354
01:16:31,988 --> 01:16:35,107
So what's next? You need 10 bucks
just to get through the night?

1355
01:16:35,107 --> 01:16:36,464
Try somebody else, pal.

1356
01:16:36,466 --> 01:16:37,762
No, man. That's not--

1357
01:16:37,762 --> 01:16:39,306
that's not what I'm
doing, I actu--

1358
01:16:39,308 --> 01:16:40,766
I just had a really long day.

1359
01:16:40,766 --> 01:16:42,738
You lost your wallet,

1360
01:16:42,740 --> 01:16:44,746
like that's your
opening gambit, man?

1361
01:16:44,748 --> 01:16:46,501
Like that's how you
start this con, right?

1362
01:16:46,503 --> 01:16:48,553
You go, oh, I lost my
wallet, take pity on me.

1363
01:16:48,555 --> 01:16:52,835
I drove up from LA, actually had
to hitchhike some of the way,

1364
01:16:52,837 --> 01:16:55,813
just trying to meet
a girl, actually.

1365
01:16:55,813 --> 01:17:00,387
Did I leave my "I give a shit" bumper
sticker on the van? Because I don't.

1366
01:17:01,387 --> 01:17:02,464
Is this your van?

1367
01:17:03,147 --> 01:17:04,016
Yes.

1368
01:17:04,018 --> 01:17:07,535
Would it be possible for me to
maybe sleep in your van for,

1369
01:17:07,544 --> 01:17:09,169
I don't know 20 minutes
or something, is that--

1370
01:17:09,169 --> 01:17:11,761
Oh, just 20 minutes
to nap in my van?

1371
01:17:11,761 --> 01:17:13,889
No, you can't nap in
my van, that's weird.

1372
01:17:14,122 --> 01:17:16,152
That's really crazy.
You're crazy.

1373
01:17:16,152 --> 01:17:17,323
No, man, I'm not, I'm not crazy.

1374
01:17:17,323 --> 01:17:18,388
Back it up, back it up.

1375
01:17:18,388 --> 01:17:18,840
Okay, okay.

1376
01:17:18,842 --> 01:17:20,213
I have pepper spray.

1377
01:17:20,215 --> 01:17:21,934
Bye. Never mind.

1378
01:17:22,581 --> 01:17:23,973
Pervert.

1379
01:17:59,063 --> 01:18:03,618
A little bright, but comfortable like this.
Comfortable…

1380
01:18:42,580 --> 01:18:44,357
We came all the way
up to Sacramento

1381
01:18:44,357 --> 01:18:45,669
and this is what
you're dreaming about?

1382
01:18:45,669 --> 01:18:46,948
Uh, I'm trying.

1383
01:18:47,835 --> 01:18:50,593
-Hey, focus. Focus, focus, focus.
-Focus. All right.

1384
01:18:50,595 --> 01:18:51,458
Focus on Nadia.

1385
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:52,451
Stop talking.

1386
01:19:17,660 --> 01:19:21,084
507 Oakwood. Okay, remember.

1387
01:19:21,482 --> 01:19:22,511
Oh.

1388
01:19:23,197 --> 01:19:24,732
You okay?

1389
01:19:24,734 --> 01:19:26,062
Did you have a bad dream?

1390
01:19:28,411 --> 01:19:29,349
I don't know.

1391
01:19:29,358 --> 01:19:33,450
Well, you know, I'm pretty good at making
people forget about their bad dreams.

1392
01:19:33,907 --> 01:19:35,073
What number was it?

1393
01:19:35,075 --> 01:19:37,468
A little after 1:00, 1:30.

1394
01:19:37,468 --> 01:19:39,314
No, no, no. What's the address?

1395
01:19:39,316 --> 01:19:42,139
Address? What address? What
are you talking about?

1396
01:19:42,139 --> 01:19:44,068
I need-- I need to write
something, I need--

1397
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:46,006
Give me a pen, give me a pen.

1398
01:19:46,008 --> 01:19:47,783
Your bike sucks.

1399
01:19:49,955 --> 01:19:50,996
And he sounds like--

1400
01:19:50,998 --> 01:19:52,925
Hey, what's up, man?
Oh, give me this.

1401
01:19:52,926 --> 01:19:54,410
407, 407.

1402
01:19:54,413 --> 01:19:56,389
Yeah, that's me.
Yeah, that's me.

1403
01:19:56,391 --> 01:19:58,719
This is that stuff I was talking about.
You're gonna love this.

1404
01:19:58,719 --> 01:19:59,702
407...

1405
01:20:02,932 --> 01:20:04,029
She giving you trouble?

1406
01:20:04,031 --> 01:20:04,902
Excuse me?

1407
01:20:12,683 --> 01:20:14,170
See? This is what
I'm talking about.

1408
01:20:14,172 --> 01:20:15,858
You can't take notes
on your hand, Ben.

1409
01:20:16,391 --> 01:20:18,466
No, no, I wasn't taking notes.

1410
01:20:18,468 --> 01:20:19,938
Hello? Are you mental?

1411
01:20:20,864 --> 01:20:22,171
Uh, sorry.

1412
01:20:22,173 --> 01:20:24,672
Told me not to call my mom.
Said she was a loser.

1413
01:20:24,674 --> 01:20:25,728
What? Hey, I didn't say that.

1414
01:20:25,730 --> 01:20:27,101
You called his mom a loser?

1415
01:20:27,103 --> 01:20:28,212
No, I didn't say that.

1416
01:20:28,214 --> 01:20:31,195
What is he, 26, 27? You're gonna
let him take over your practice?

1417
01:20:31,197 --> 01:20:33,906
I know, he can barely move a
mattress without needing a break.

1418
01:20:33,908 --> 01:20:35,398
He smells like onions.

1419
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:36,580
He does smell like onions.

1420
01:20:36,582 --> 01:20:37,073
Gross.

1421
01:20:37,075 --> 01:20:40,204
Oh, Oakwood! It was 54--

1422
01:20:40,206 --> 01:20:40,805
What?

1423
01:20:40,807 --> 01:20:42,188
-What?
-What are you talking about?

1424
01:20:42,190 --> 01:20:43,718
Right, Oakwood! 542 Oakwood!

1425
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:45,096
Oh, I'm sorry. This
session is just--

1426
01:20:46,941 --> 01:20:47,869
-Disaster.
-Disaster.

1427
01:20:48,116 --> 01:20:49,970
750, 750.

1428
01:20:49,970 --> 01:20:53,719
We're playing 101, 2s and 3s,
to 21, you're losing. 17-0.

1429
01:20:53,719 --> 01:20:57,984
Yeah. No, stop, it's an address.
It's in Oaktree.

1430
01:20:57,986 --> 01:20:59,900
It's not an Oaktree,
it's Hemlock!

1431
01:20:59,902 --> 01:21:01,752
Ben, you're late. Have
a seat on the slide.

1432
01:21:01,752 --> 01:21:03,439
No, uh-- no. I want to find...

1433
01:21:03,439 --> 01:21:06,113
Look, there's no oak here.

1434
01:21:06,113 --> 01:21:07,198
Is he on medication?

1435
01:21:07,198 --> 01:21:09,611
I think he is, found
some weird pills.

1436
01:21:12,961 --> 01:21:16,264
Rose, 5-- 507, no.

1437
01:21:16,266 --> 01:21:18,203
Ben, do you want help me out? I'm
trying to run a session here.

1438
01:21:18,205 --> 01:21:21,408
No, I don't want to be a shrink.
Will you just call your mom already?

1439
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:22,330
That was rude.

1440
01:21:23,036 --> 01:21:24,060
You're having trouble?

1441
01:21:25,164 --> 01:21:26,909
4--7--

1442
01:21:26,911 --> 01:21:27,784
Having problems?

1443
01:21:27,784 --> 01:21:29,002
Honey, have you met Harry?

1444
01:21:29,002 --> 01:21:30,876
No, but I'd like to.

1445
01:21:30,878 --> 01:21:32,750
This is your daughter?

1446
01:21:32,750 --> 01:21:33,951
-Hi.
-Hi.

1447
01:21:34,961 --> 01:21:36,470
Wow. How tall are you?

1448
01:21:36,470 --> 01:21:38,398
6'3", 195.

1449
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:38,994
It's true.

1450
01:21:38,996 --> 01:21:40,751
Will you guys stop
saying numbers, please?

1451
01:21:40,753 --> 01:21:42,236
Got a 1,600 on my SAT.

1452
01:21:42,238 --> 01:21:42,786
Really?

1453
01:21:42,788 --> 01:21:43,999
Harry runs a hedge fund.

1454
01:21:44,001 --> 01:21:46,267
Ben, you're gonna miss the bus.

1455
01:21:47,363 --> 01:21:48,726
You can't sleep here.

1456
01:21:48,728 --> 01:21:50,096
Hey, that's my bike.

1457
01:21:50,096 --> 01:21:51,904
This bike? You know
this bike sucks.

1458
01:21:51,906 --> 01:21:53,797
Ben, you can't sleep out here.

1459
01:21:53,799 --> 01:21:54,940
You can't sleep here.

1460
01:21:54,942 --> 01:21:56,314
You can't sleep out here, Ben.

1461
01:21:56,314 --> 01:21:57,675
You can't sleep here, Ben.

1462
01:21:57,677 --> 01:21:58,476
You can't sleep here!

1463
01:21:58,478 --> 01:21:59,931
507, Woodoak. That's
it, that's it.

1464
01:21:59,933 --> 01:22:02,780
507, okay, remember,
remember, Ben.

1465
01:22:02,782 --> 01:22:04,737
You can't sleep here.

1466
01:22:04,739 --> 01:22:08,497
You can't sleep here.
You can't sleep here.

1467
01:22:08,499 --> 01:22:12,483
You can't sleep here.
You can't sleep here.

1468
01:22:12,734 --> 01:22:13,605
Sorry.

1469
01:22:13,607 --> 01:22:17,488
For 57 years I've been
sleeping here, remember that.

1470
01:22:17,927 --> 01:22:21,254
Fifty-seven years I've
been sleeping here.

1471
01:22:22,180 --> 01:22:23,669
Fifty-seven.

1472
01:22:49,911 --> 01:22:51,341
Watch it.

1473
01:23:57,486 --> 01:24:00,998
Hi. I found you.

1474
01:24:01,777 --> 01:24:04,429
Um, sorry, this--

1475
01:24:04,431 --> 01:24:06,955
okay, it's late. I
want to say something.

1476
01:24:10,751 --> 01:24:12,439
On my last day in the army...

1477
01:24:15,316 --> 01:24:17,862
I tried to give my
sergeant all my stuff,

1478
01:24:17,862 --> 01:24:20,256
my gear, my uniforms,
everything,

1479
01:24:20,258 --> 01:24:24,518
and I tried to give him
my dog tags and he said,

1480
01:24:24,518 --> 01:24:25,819
these aren't for me.

1481
01:24:25,819 --> 01:24:29,393
These are for the love
of my life someday.

1482
01:24:30,306 --> 01:24:31,941
And I said, how will I know?

1483
01:24:31,941 --> 01:24:34,487
And he said, when you don't
have to think about it.

1484
01:24:35,634 --> 01:24:37,378
With Amy, I almost
gave them to her

1485
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:39,550
but I had to think about it
and that was the problem.

1486
01:24:39,550 --> 01:24:43,268
But with you, I know you
must be the love of my life

1487
01:24:43,643 --> 01:24:44,740
'cause

1488
01:24:45,811 --> 01:24:48,058
I don't have to think about it.

1489
01:24:49,569 --> 01:24:51,275
Who are you?

1490
01:24:56,164 --> 01:25:00,864
You're just a guy that
I met in the park.

1491
01:25:03,189 --> 01:25:06,173
This is only the second time I've
seen you when I've been awake.

1492
01:25:08,073 --> 01:25:10,794
And it's the second time
I've seen you and, look,

1493
01:25:10,796 --> 01:25:12,370
you don't have to see me

1494
01:25:12,372 --> 01:25:14,394
ever again here or

1495
01:25:14,396 --> 01:25:15,593
anywhere, but

1496
01:25:16,712 --> 01:25:20,112
I made a promise
to my sergeant...

1497
01:25:20,910 --> 01:25:23,388
and to my father. So

1498
01:25:24,333 --> 01:25:25,873
I have to give these to you.

1499
01:25:30,055 --> 01:25:32,290
I didn't say I wasn't
gonna take them.

1500
01:25:34,747 --> 01:25:38,742
I'm single now, by the way, I
don't know if you're still--

1501
01:25:38,744 --> 01:25:40,839
if you have your
boyfriend, if he's...

1502
01:25:42,975 --> 01:25:44,004
How could I?

1503
01:25:59,645 --> 01:26:00,677
Do you snore?

1504
01:26:01,364 --> 01:26:03,346
Yup.

1505
01:26:04,937 --> 01:26:07,156
Do you flail around?

1506
01:26:08,508 --> 01:26:10,800
Yup, got the jimmy legs.

1507
01:26:10,802 --> 01:26:12,585
Jimmy legs? Uh-oh.

1508
01:26:13,802 --> 01:26:15,209
What about you?

1509
01:26:16,101 --> 01:26:19,149
Well, yeah, I got
the jimmy legs.

1510
01:26:19,151 --> 01:26:20,443
Jimmy arms,

1511
01:26:20,754 --> 01:26:23,568
I even got a guy named Jimmy
that wakes me up every 3 hours,

1512
01:26:23,568 --> 01:26:25,913
busts into the room. Is
that gonna be a problem?

1513
01:26:25,913 --> 01:26:27,980
No, no, no problem.

1514
01:26:27,985 --> 01:26:28,793
Okay.

1515
01:26:32,218 --> 01:26:35,151
I'm also unemployed now.

1516
01:26:36,570 --> 01:26:38,553
I quit my job today.

1517
01:26:39,630 --> 01:26:40,761
Today?

1518
01:26:42,531 --> 01:26:43,202
Yeah.

1519
01:26:43,204 --> 01:26:45,828
My plan was for you
to support me.

1520
01:26:45,830 --> 01:26:47,273
-We're screwed.
-We're screwed.

1521
01:26:53,617 --> 01:26:56,252
Tell me something I
don't know about you.

1522
01:26:57,653 --> 01:26:59,693
You know everything about me.

1523
01:27:02,048 --> 01:27:03,192
Prove it.
