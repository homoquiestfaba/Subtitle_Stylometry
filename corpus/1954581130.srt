1
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:04,123
             Hello?

2
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:06,959
I'm in the house,

3
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:08,360
about to leave.

4
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:12,431
Okay, I'll do it right now,

5
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:14,500
but then that's it.

6
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:17,636
I'm leaving right after.

7
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:20,005
You made it clear.

8
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:33,872
Who is it?

9
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,821
This can't be happening.

10
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:36,828
I'm sorry.

11
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:57,802
Ladies and gentlemen,

12
00:08:57,804 --> 00:09:00,605
we're now approaching Santa
Clara airport. It's 12:00 p.m...

13
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:11,316
     Welcome to Santa Clara!

14
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:13,385
               Hi.

15
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:18,423
-You look beautiful.
-Thanks, Dad.

16
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:19,624
          So grown up.

17
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:22,527
   You look exactly the same.

18
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:25,664
  Ah, look at my granddaughter.

19
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:26,965
     Such a beautiful smile.

20
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:30,101
Beautiful brown eyes,
just like your mother.

21
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:32,671
    I've got brown eyes, too.

22
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:35,941
       You're a Harriman.

23
00:09:35,943 --> 00:09:38,243
    Look at the size of you!

24
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:41,646
We're gonna have to stop
you growing up too quick.

25
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:43,248
How was the flight,
Paul?

26
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,050
        Oh, it was fine.

27
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:47,485
Welcome to Colombia.

28
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:49,921
You'll have better weather
here than in London.

29
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,691
Your boxes arrived safely
and they're waiting for you

30
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:53,925
at the house.

31
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,360
Santa Clara was built
around the Aguas Rojas

32
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:56,795
neighborhood.

33
00:09:56,797 --> 00:10:00,432
It used to be a fishing village,
now it's grown into a town.

34
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:07,172
The fishing has gone.
Everyone works in the factory.

35
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:12,043
They're lovely people.
Very warm, very hard-working.

36
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:14,913
A little bit young, no?

37
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:17,415
-Rules are a little different
here.

38
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:22,187
So, Sarah, I have to travel
to Sao Paulo next week,

39
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:25,457
which means we have a few
intense days ahead of us

40
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:26,358
at the plant.

41
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,359
             Great.

42
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:30,261
Grandpa, what do you do
in your factory?

43
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:32,664
         We make paper.

44
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,766
And your mom
is going to work there.

45
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:36,901
   She's going to be the boss.

46
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:39,270
That's right!

47
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:42,607
And when you grow up,
if you're a good girl,

48
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:44,342
    you can be the boss, too.

49
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:46,845
Unless you want to be

50
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:48,046
a rock star.

51
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:59,257
Come on!
Get out of the road!

52
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:07,132
  Hey, can you open the window?

53
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:50,442
Here we are!
This is your new home.

54
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,112
        Come on, sweetie.

55
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:56,715
       What do you think?
         It's beautiful.

56
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:58,750
It's huge.
How did you find it?

57
00:11:58,752 --> 00:12:00,685
   It belongs to the company.

58
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:03,722
Most executives don't bring
their families or they prefer

59
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:04,689
to stay in town.

60
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:09,094
Nobody has lived here for years.

61
00:12:09,096 --> 00:12:11,730
So, how is the art world
treating you, Paul?

62
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:15,066
You know, it's never gonna
make me rich, but it's all

63
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,134
right, it's okay.

64
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:17,502
        Oh, you like it?

65
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:18,870
         It's a castle!

66
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:20,939
It is a castle!
Here. Hold it there.

67
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:23,341
             Gotcha!

68
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:25,944
She looks beautiful! Come here,
I want to show you something.

69
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:28,813
A big surprise for you
down here.

70
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:53,404
Well, it definitely
doesn't suck.

71
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:55,807
        No, it does not.

72
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,255
It's amazing!

73
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:21,866
            Woo-hoo!

74
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:27,405
           Don't jump!

75
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:31,543
Thank you, Jordan. This
is all very nice. Thank you.

76
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:32,510
        It's my pleasure.

77
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:34,445
How do you like
Hannah's house?

78
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:36,281
Yeah, it's great. She's
going to love it. Thank you.

79
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:37,916
I meant to tell you, the help
will be here tomorrow...

80
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:39,117
if you need a hand
with anything.

81
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:40,618
           Okay. Okay.

82
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,554
I'm heading off now,
but I'll come back tomorrow.

83
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:45,256
Take you into town, if you want
to pick up some supplies or...

84
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:47,025
Okay.
Thanks, Dad.

85
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:49,594
       Okay. Bye, Hannah!

86
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:51,296
    Bye, Grandpa! Thank you!

87
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:53,231
         You're welcome!

88
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:58,069
Not sure why, but I thought
he was gonna hate me like...

89
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:00,972
a little less in Colombia.
Just like a little bit.

90
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:02,507
      He doesn't hate you.

91
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,943
          He hates me.

92
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:06,144
  We're going to be happy here.

93
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:09,547
Of course.
Of course, we will.

94
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:23,561
Dad, I can't sleep.
This room is too big.

95
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:25,630
Okay, let's play our game.

96
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:27,465
Okay.

97
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:30,034
            Mermaid.

98
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,103
             Dream.

99
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:34,472
             Mother.

100
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:36,908
              Room.

101
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,410
             Market.

102
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:41,446
            Treasure.

103
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,918
            Elevator.

104
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,555
         Good. Rabbits!

105
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:52,924
             Turtle.

106
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:56,995
      No, no, no. Rabbits.

107
00:14:56,997 --> 00:14:59,998
             Silver.

108
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,566
             River.

109
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:05,837
              Rock.

110
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,672
              Kid.

111
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:10,141
              Dad.

112
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:11,943
              Dark.

113
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:13,478
              King.

114
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:18,016
              Good.

115
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:20,385
      Good night, sweetie.

116
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,362
       Can you close that?

117
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:36,467
           Of course.

118
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:06,965
This is the central market.

119
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:10,601
You can find almost
everything you'll need in here.

120
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:14,105
It's especially crowded these
days because of the celebration.

121
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:16,074
What's all this about?
What are they celebrating?

122
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:18,876
It's called
"La Fiesta de los Niños Santos".

123
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:22,080
Why are they putting on
those bandages, Grandpa?

124
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:23,514
Are
they sick?

125
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:26,084
They're dressing up,
honey. Happens every year.

126
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:29,754
They celebrate something that
happened a long, long time ago.

127
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:32,557
Well, everything here
happened a long time ago.

128
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:39,030
Look at those candy!
You like those?

129
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:41,232
      What about this one?

130
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:43,334
          Or this one?

131
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,703
Break out the wallet.
We're in deep trouble now,

132
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:46,738
my man.

133
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,639
         Yeah, I see it.

134
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:50,475
How much is this?

135
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:53,077
You get down,
I'll get the money.

136
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:19,737
          We got jugs.
           Wind chime?

137
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:21,806
I'm good for wind chimes,
right this second.

138
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:28,946
         Muchas gracias.

139
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:32,750
Sarah... have you
got Hannah?

140
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,168
Hannah!
Mummy!

141
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,836
       Sweetie, I told you
         to stay close.

142
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:52,804
         Silver's gone!

143
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:55,306
It's okay, you're fine,
you're fine.

144
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:57,775
           She's okay.

145
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,321
Just try it.

146
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:12,323
No? You didn't eat
anything today.

147
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:14,559
         I'm not hungry.

148
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:16,928
Okay, kiddo, look at this.
I got your favorite

149
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,396
dessert here.

150
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:20,098
We got strawberry yogurt, we got
bananas, we got some chocolate.

151
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,033
       What do you think?
               Mm.

152
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:24,469
Two little bites of this,
and you get to have all of this.

153
00:18:24,471 --> 00:18:25,903
What do you think?

154
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:27,171
       I want Silver back.

155
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:30,808
You want Silver back? Well,
we've already talked about that.

156
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,310
We're going to go look
for him tomorrow, okay?

157
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:33,845
     A little girl took him.

158
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:37,215
     She had a mask on her face.
     She had a mask on her face?

159
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:41,486
Come here.
We're going to go upstairs.

160
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:43,121
     Say goodnight to Mommy.

161
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:44,956
     Good night, sweetheart.

162
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,457
And we're going to try and calm
down here.

163
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:47,391
What do you say
about that?

164
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:49,227
              Okay.

165
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:50,795
I don't like losing
my stuff, either.

166
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:52,964
I didn't lose him.
She took him!

167
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:56,901
Okay, okay, a little girl
took him, I understand.

168
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,824
   She was pretty upset there.

169
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:22,126
  She's okay now, she's asleep.

170
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:23,895
         She'll be fine.
              Yeah.

171
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:26,797
     She'll forget about it.
            She will.

172
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,500
You okay?
Are you a bit nervous?

173
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:33,004
I feel like it's
the first day of school.

174
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:34,972
     You're gonna be great.

175
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,843
           Come here.

176
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,686
I've made a cream cake.
Thank you.

177
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,155
Would you like me to pour you
some tea? Yes, please.

178
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:53,224
        With sugar? Yes.

179
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:54,625
Hey, hey.
Hi.

180
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:56,460
         You all right?
              Yes.

181
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:57,895
       Okay, I'm gonna be
       over there working.

182
00:19:57,897 --> 00:19:58,996
              Okay.

183
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:03,501
   Would you like some sugar?
               No.

184
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:08,406
I've made you
a surprise birthday cake.

185
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:12,877
Thank you.
I can drink the tea.

186
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:19,717
I can't eat the cake
because I'm on a diet. Mm.

187
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,889
You look sleepy.

188
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:28,192
I can't believe
you remembered my birthday.

189
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:34,265
So, I'll give you some cake.
It's my specialty.

190
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:39,070
You can have some tea.
Yes.

191
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,304
           Thank you.

192
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,441
             And...

193
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:23,674
             Hannah!

194
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:32,350
             Hannah!

195
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:45,429
             Silver!

196
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,410
Hannah!

197
00:22:59,412 --> 00:23:01,112
What are you doing
out here, kiddo?

198
00:23:01,114 --> 00:23:02,646
Not out of my sight,
that's our rule, you know that.

199
00:23:02,648 --> 00:23:04,615
         Silver's here!
           Come here.

200
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:07,251
Okay... there's nothing
there, Hannah.

201
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:08,753
Anyway, I thought you said
someone took him.

202
00:23:08,755 --> 00:23:11,088
But I just saw him.

203
00:23:12,658 --> 00:23:14,892
 Come on, don't make things up.

204
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:16,761
Besides, everyone knows
if you spend too much time

205
00:23:16,763 --> 00:23:17,661
alone in the jungle...

206
00:23:17,663 --> 00:23:18,896
     you turn into a monkey.

207
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:23,667
Dad, you're the one making
things up.

208
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:26,337
                             Hi.
                             Hi.

209
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:27,605
         Hi, Mr. Holden.

210
00:23:27,607 --> 00:23:30,174
No, Paul, please.
Catalina, right?

211
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:32,710
     Yeah, nice to meet you.
        Nice to meet you.

212
00:23:32,712 --> 00:23:33,878
 And you must be Hannah, right?

213
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,146
Hi.
               Hi.

214
00:23:35,148 --> 00:23:37,615
I brought these for you.
Do you like stickers?

215
00:23:37,617 --> 00:23:39,116
             Mm-hm.

216
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:40,951
She wants to say thank you.
Say thank you, buddy.

217
00:23:40,953 --> 00:23:42,286
           Thank you.
          There you go.

218
00:23:42,288 --> 00:23:43,821
         You're welcome.

219
00:23:43,823 --> 00:23:45,089
         Would you like
       to look at my toys?

220
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:45,956
              Sure.

221
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:47,458
I'll go grab us
some lemonade, okay?

222
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,926
Okay.
Okay.

223
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:52,530
  Wow! You have a lot of toys!

224
00:23:52,532 --> 00:23:54,665
    I have more than eighty,
        I think. -Really?

225
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:56,233
 Maybe even more, I don't know.

226
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:14,852
We changed the whole
system a few years ago.

227
00:24:14,854 --> 00:24:16,620
   Where's the chlorine plant?

228
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:19,023
We don't produce
our own whitener anymore.

229
00:24:19,025 --> 00:24:22,860
It's cheaper to import it,
and we don't have to worry

230
00:24:22,862 --> 00:24:24,161
about the mercury.

231
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:27,798
There used to be a plant
over at the old mill,

232
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,633
but it was too dangerous.

233
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:33,370
I want to introduce you to some
of the state committee members

234
00:24:33,372 --> 00:24:34,472
   who regulate the business.

235
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:35,773
        What? Right now?

236
00:24:35,775 --> 00:24:39,143
No, no, no, no, no. Tonight, at
dinner.

237
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:42,713
The festival will have started
then, it should be a lot of fun.

238
00:24:42,715 --> 00:24:45,416
              Okay.

239
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:56,293
     Can you give me a hand?

240
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:01,065
       You look beautiful.

241
00:25:01,067 --> 00:25:02,833
           Thank you.

242
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:05,236
        You almost ready?

243
00:25:05,238 --> 00:25:07,972
             Almost.

244
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:14,345
       Looks good, kiddo.
           Thank you.

245
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:26,023
Hello.
Hi.

246
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:31,328
You been doing this a long time?

247
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,430
     Yeah, about five years.

248
00:25:33,432 --> 00:25:35,666
I'm working to pay my studies.
Oh, yeah?

249
00:25:35,668 --> 00:25:36,967
      I'm almost a teacher.

250
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:38,736
You want to be a teacher?
Yeah.

251
00:25:38,738 --> 00:25:40,704
          That's great.

252
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:42,072
       Here's our numbers.

253
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:44,074
Uh, Hannah goes to bed
at 8:30.

254
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:46,377
She's gonna say 9:00.
It's 8:30.

255
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:47,945
              Okay.

256
00:25:47,947 --> 00:25:50,414
We'll be home at 11:00.
We're going to the...

257
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:51,849
   What is it? La fiesta de...

258
00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:55,152
La Fiesta de los Niños Santos.
Yes, that's right.

259
00:25:55,154 --> 00:25:56,754
  The festival of the children?

260
00:25:56,756 --> 00:25:58,422
Yeah, of the saints children.
Right.

261
00:25:58,424 --> 00:26:00,824
It has a very special meaning
for the people of Santa Clara.

262
00:26:00,826 --> 00:26:03,027
Yeah, it seems like
a very big celebration here.

263
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:05,462
    Well, not a celebration.

264
00:26:05,464 --> 00:26:10,868
The fiesta is more
about remembering our past.

265
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,570
It happened hundreds

266
00:26:12,572 --> 00:26:13,904
of years ago.

267
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:16,173
The conquistadors
reached Santa Clara,

268
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:19,310
but when they got here,
they just found a poor village,

269
00:26:19,312 --> 00:26:21,979
so they kidnapped
all the children

270
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:25,916
and locked them up in a temple
and asked for a ransom...

271
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:28,218
     their weight in silver.

272
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:35,426
Santa Clara asked all the
surrounding villages for help

273
00:26:35,428 --> 00:26:38,262
to gather enough silver
to pay the ransom.

274
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:40,731
The conquistadors kept
the silver,

275
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:45,502
but they didn't keep their word
and they lit the temple on fire.

276
00:26:45,504 --> 00:26:47,671
    With the children inside?

277
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:58,816
Some people believe
the ghosts of the kids are still

278
00:26:58,818 --> 00:27:00,017
around looking for revenge.

279
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:03,420
Anything bad that happens
is blamed on them.

280
00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:05,489
      What do you believe?

281
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:14,999
You know you can call us anytime
while we're gone, okay?

282
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:17,868
  Even if it's just to say hi.

283
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,036
Are you going to show your
drawing to Catalina

284
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:20,170
when I'm gone?

285
00:27:20,172 --> 00:27:21,338
            Might do.

286
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,040
       Come on, let's go.
              Okay.

287
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:44,261
         Buenos noches.
 Buenos noches, Senor Harriman.

288
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:51,268
              Hey!

289
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:54,705
          How are you?

290
00:27:54,707 --> 00:27:56,940
Sarah, I'd like you to meet
an old friend of mine,

291
00:27:56,942 --> 00:27:58,342
        a very good man,

292
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:01,078
Andrés Contreras,
he's the local company doctor.

293
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,279
      Oh, nice to meet you.

294
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:03,414
            And you.

295
00:28:03,416 --> 00:28:04,682
    This is my husband, Paul.
         How you doing?

296
00:28:04,684 --> 00:28:06,517
           A pleasure.
        Nice to meet you.

297
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:08,052
           Por favor.

298
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:17,261
             Jordan!

299
00:28:17,263 --> 00:28:19,863
             Jorge!

300
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:21,165
            Senator.
         Oh, thank you.

301
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:23,534
Sarah, I'd like you
to meet Senator Marañon.

302
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:26,537
Sarah is going to be the new
General Manager at the plant.

303
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:27,838
           Oh, great.

304
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,274
I'm very excited to be here.

305
00:28:30,276 --> 00:28:32,109
I look forward to knowing more

306
00:28:32,111 --> 00:28:33,010
about this country.

307
00:28:33,012 --> 00:28:35,579
     Very impressive indeed.

308
00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:37,915
Your father has been a great
friend of our community

309
00:28:37,917 --> 00:28:38,882
for a long, long time.

310
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:40,484
Oh, come on.
Come on, let's eat.

311
00:28:40,486 --> 00:28:41,652
              Okay.

312
00:28:41,654 --> 00:28:44,054
        Doctor Contreras.

313
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:50,761
Tomorrow we're going to play
all the morning.

314
00:28:50,763 --> 00:28:52,730
          Sounds good?

315
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:58,902
   But now it's time to sleep.

316
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:01,772
  And have a good night, honey.
           Thank you.

317
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:08,812
           Good night.

318
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:46,850
Come on, Sarah.
Dance with your father.

319
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,962
So, what kind of job
did you leave behind

320
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:00,030
to come here?

321
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:03,367
   No, no, I'm keeping my job.

322
00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:06,170
I'm an illustrator.
I illustrate children's books.

323
00:30:06,172 --> 00:30:09,506
I wish I could treat
my patients from anywhere.

324
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,278
       You still have it.

325
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:19,416
       You were so young.

326
00:30:19,418 --> 00:30:21,552
I'm starting to forget
what she looks like.

327
00:30:21,554 --> 00:30:24,254
She would have been
proud of you.

328
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:27,257
Did you grow up here?

329
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:29,393
My parents moved here
when I was a child,

330
00:30:29,395 --> 00:30:32,596
when my father started working
as a doctor at the paper mill.

331
00:30:32,598 --> 00:30:33,363
Really?

332
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:38,268
They lived in your house.
My father had his clinic there.

333
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,636
Oh, yeah?
Mm-hm.

334
00:30:39,638 --> 00:30:41,471
You ever live there?
No.

335
00:30:41,473 --> 00:30:43,807
I was sent away
to boarding school.

336
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:45,909
Jordan sent Sarah to boarding
school in the States.

337
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:47,344
   Is that where you guys met?

338
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:49,446
   No, no, we met in New York.

339
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:52,082
We got married there
and then we moved to London.

340
00:30:52,084 --> 00:30:55,786
We had our daughter, Hannah,
and now we're here.

341
00:30:55,788 --> 00:30:57,754
      It's a good decision.

342
00:30:57,756 --> 00:31:00,624
I worry about moving her around
too much, but you know we gotta

343
00:31:00,626 --> 00:31:01,959
be together, so...

344
00:31:01,961 --> 00:31:05,762
Many may advise against bringing
children to a place like

345
00:31:05,764 --> 00:31:07,030
Santa Clara, but...

346
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:08,532
        What do you mean?

347
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:11,435
Some people are
concerned about safety.

348
00:31:11,437 --> 00:31:14,304
And the dark legends
don't exactly help, either.

349
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:32,956
     Paul! Paul, come here!

350
00:31:42,768 --> 00:31:44,534
       It's so beautiful.

351
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:46,503
Well, it's not really.

352
00:31:46,505 --> 00:31:50,140
500 years ago, the conquistadors
came here looking for silver...

353
00:31:50,142 --> 00:31:54,511
and burned all the children
of this village alive.

354
00:31:54,513 --> 00:31:58,415
They put cloth on their faces
to cover the burns.

355
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:04,321
They're taking the statues
to the church.

356
00:32:04,323 --> 00:32:08,325
People go there and pray
to appease their angry spirits.

357
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:34,738
             Silver!

358
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:50,447
       Come here, Silver.

359
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:52,682
           Come here.

360
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:08,365
             Silver.

361
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:27,417
             Hey...
              Yeah?

362
00:36:27,419 --> 00:36:28,585
          Are you okay?

363
00:36:28,587 --> 00:36:32,889
         Yeah, I'm fine.
              Okay.

364
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,103
               Hi.
              Hey.

365
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:23,039
      You're back so early.
     Oh, we're getting old.

366
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:24,140
     How did everything go?

367
00:37:24,142 --> 00:37:25,842
          Fine. Just...

368
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:26,743
              Fine.

369
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:28,645
     Is she asleep upstairs?

370
00:37:28,647 --> 00:37:34,351
Mum! Catalina!

371
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:39,489
         Mum! Catalina!

372
00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:43,760
Can you hear me?
Mum!

373
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:49,032
            Help me!

374
00:37:49,034 --> 00:37:50,867
           I'm stuck!

375
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,080
             Hannah!

376
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:12,222
       No, she's not here.

377
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,790
             Hannah!

378
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:17,794
Hannah! Hannah!

379
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:24,200
             Hannah?

380
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:28,638
             Hannah!

381
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:31,408
    She's got to be up here.

382
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:39,649
             Hannah?

383
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,185
        The dumb waiter.

384
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,659
She's in here!

385
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:51,261
She's in here!
Hannah!

386
00:38:51,263 --> 00:38:53,363
Come on.

387
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,300
          Oh, sweetie.

388
00:38:57,302 --> 00:38:59,502
    You're okay, you're okay.

389
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:01,271
             Hannah!
        Sweetie, wake up.

390
00:39:01,273 --> 00:39:03,206
  Sweetie, sweetie, look at me.

391
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:04,974
         Hannah! Hannah.

392
00:39:04,976 --> 00:39:07,177
         Open your eyes.
     Hannah! Open your eyes.

393
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:09,879
        She's burning up.

394
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:36,406
         Hannah Holden?

395
00:39:36,408 --> 00:39:38,074
              Yeah.

396
00:39:38,076 --> 00:39:42,879
Have a fever, disorientation,
pain in her joints.

397
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:44,314
     It's probably the flu.

398
00:39:44,316 --> 00:39:45,415
      What about that rash?

399
00:39:45,417 --> 00:39:46,716
   The rash could be anything.

400
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:49,652
Something she ate
or an insect bite.

401
00:39:49,654 --> 00:39:51,654
Do you know if she
drank tap water?

402
00:39:51,656 --> 00:39:54,758
I don't think so, I told her
not to. Excuse me.

403
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,660
In my opinion,
she needs to rest.

404
00:39:57,662 --> 00:40:00,196
She should take an aspirin
and drink a lot of water.

405
00:40:00,198 --> 00:40:03,066
And we can keep her under
observation if you want...

406
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:05,702
and run a blood test,
just to make sure.

407
00:40:05,704 --> 00:40:08,438
    That won't be necessary.
           Excuse me?

408
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,107
 The company plan will cover it.

409
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:12,409
           If I may...

410
00:40:12,411 --> 00:40:15,245
Doctor, realistically,
how long will it take you...

411
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:19,249
to get Hannah's blood test
results back?

412
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:23,052
          A few weeks.
              Okay.

413
00:40:23,054 --> 00:40:25,622
We can have them back
in less than 48 hours.

414
00:40:25,624 --> 00:40:27,357
              Okay.

415
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:30,460
We're going to have
to do what's best for Hannah.

416
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:27,250
Is she okay?
I'm sorry about what happened.

417
00:41:27,252 --> 00:41:29,419
I don't understand
how she got in there.

418
00:41:29,421 --> 00:41:31,921
I don't know. She was
asleep when I checked.

419
00:41:31,923 --> 00:41:35,091
Come on, Catalina, there's
something strange going on here.

420
00:41:35,093 --> 00:41:36,559
What are you not telling us?

421
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:40,430
Look, I'm not the kind person
who believes in these sort

422
00:41:40,432 --> 00:41:41,397
of things...

423
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:46,769
but there was something
around the house.

424
00:41:46,771 --> 00:41:49,138
          Like ghosts.

425
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,409
Okay, you know what?
This is not going to work.

426
00:41:53,411 --> 00:41:56,145
I'm very sorry, but you don't
have to come back tomorrow,

427
00:41:56,147 --> 00:41:57,447
okay?

428
00:41:57,449 --> 00:41:58,915
              Okay.

429
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:16,199
 I'll call the company tomorrow
  and find somebody new. Okay.

430
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:18,201
   I'll watch Hannah tonight.
              Okay.

431
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:19,536
         Get some rest.

432
00:43:57,735 --> 00:43:59,535
     Are you okay, sweetie?

433
00:43:59,537 --> 00:44:00,837
Can I have some water,
please?

434
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:02,972
        Yeah, of course.

435
00:44:19,023 --> 00:44:21,791
Hi.

436
00:44:21,793 --> 00:44:23,559
              Hey.

437
00:44:23,561 --> 00:44:28,164
        How's she doing?
  She's been sleeping all day.

438
00:47:01,852 --> 00:47:03,686
              Paul?

439
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:25,341
              Paul?

440
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,481
       What are you doing?

441
00:47:32,483 --> 00:47:35,785
              Paul?

442
00:47:35,787 --> 00:47:37,920
          Are you okay?

443
00:47:39,324 --> 00:47:41,257
   I think I heard something.

444
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:53,169
Hannah is awake.

445
00:47:53,171 --> 00:47:56,239
 Let's go back inside the house.

446
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:02,078
There's someone in there!

447
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,820
     She's okay! She's okay!

448
00:48:10,822 --> 00:48:12,321
          Are you okay?

449
00:48:12,323 --> 00:48:15,691
I could have sworn
that I saw someone up here.

450
00:48:15,693 --> 00:48:18,594
           It's okay.

451
00:48:18,596 --> 00:48:20,196
I think we're just both
really tired.

452
00:48:20,198 --> 00:48:21,597
And I think we need
to get some rest.

453
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,867
We've got to sleep.
It's been a long night.

454
00:48:24,869 --> 00:48:27,570
       Okay? Let's sleep.

455
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:56,432
Excuse me, María.

456
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:58,367
Do you know
where do we keep the...

457
00:48:58,369 --> 00:48:59,835
       ...balance sheets?

458
00:48:59,837 --> 00:49:02,405
They are on the server and there
are copies in your office.

459
00:49:02,407 --> 00:49:06,442
Yes, no, I saw those.
I mean from like 20 years ago.

460
00:49:06,444 --> 00:49:08,177
    Mr. Harriman might know.

461
00:49:08,179 --> 00:49:11,781
Sarah.

462
00:49:11,783 --> 00:49:14,417
           She's fine.

463
00:49:14,419 --> 00:49:15,918
  The results came back normal.

464
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,754
No, she's not fine. And it's not
just the flu.

465
00:49:18,756 --> 00:49:20,756
Okay, flu symptoms vary
depending on the strain

466
00:49:20,758 --> 00:49:22,191
and environment...

467
00:49:22,193 --> 00:49:25,828
but no, it's probably an
intestinal virus and it's very

468
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:27,029
common in the tropics.

469
00:49:27,031 --> 00:49:30,967
Give her this for four days,
twice a day. She'll be fine.

470
00:49:30,969 --> 00:49:32,368
              Okay.

471
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,598
      What was that about?

472
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,568
What they don't teach you
at business school.

473
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:07,903
Have you seen the financials
from 20 years ago?

474
00:50:07,905 --> 00:50:09,572
       I can't find them.

475
00:50:09,574 --> 00:50:12,908
Yeah, that's tricky.
Everything is computerized now.

476
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:15,578
I don't even know where
half that old stuff is.

477
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:18,314
I'll get someone
to dig it out for you.

478
00:50:18,316 --> 00:50:19,582
     Tell me, how's Hannah?

479
00:50:19,584 --> 00:50:22,585
Contreras thinks
it's an intestinal virus.

480
00:50:22,587 --> 00:50:25,588
Are you going to be all right
when I go to Sao Paulo?

481
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:26,622
              Yeah.

482
00:50:26,624 --> 00:50:29,125
            You sure?
        Yeah, I think so.

483
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:41,704
I think we gotta get
a second opinion here, Sarah.

484
00:50:41,706 --> 00:50:45,307
She's getting worse and these
pills, they're not working.

485
00:50:45,309 --> 00:50:47,443
          Look at this.

486
00:50:47,445 --> 00:50:49,612
Why didn't you call me?

487
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:56,619
          I don't know.

488
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:02,558
Listen, I think I gotta
get her home.

489
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,226
Until she's better,
I think I gotta get her

490
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:05,628
to a real hospital.

491
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:06,729
               No.

492
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:09,031
           What do you mean, no?
           No, we should all go.

493
00:51:10,867 --> 00:51:13,669
It's my fault. It's my fault
for bringing her here.

494
00:51:13,671 --> 00:51:16,572
This is not your fault. We both
brought her here, you know that.

495
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:18,207
We should leave here
tomorrow.

496
00:51:18,209 --> 00:51:20,042
              Okay.

497
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:26,949
Everything is gonna be okay,
sweetie.

498
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:31,787
  I'm gonna make a cup of tea.
              Okay.

499
00:51:31,789 --> 00:51:34,657
I want to stay up
with her tonight.

500
00:52:12,863 --> 00:52:14,697
             Sarah?

501
00:52:14,699 --> 00:52:16,298
Yeah, I'm just looking

502
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:17,666
for a candle!

503
00:52:17,668 --> 00:52:19,201
              Okay.

504
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:31,514
               Ow!

505
00:54:00,204 --> 00:54:04,173
        Sarah? You okay?

506
00:54:12,482 --> 00:54:14,283
      Where is my daughter?

507
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:18,354
             Mummy!

508
00:54:19,322 --> 00:54:20,889
             Hannah!

509
00:54:21,791 --> 00:54:23,292
              Stop!

510
00:54:25,295 --> 00:54:27,796
         Oko-maha-neea.

511
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:41,010
         Oko-maha-neea.

512
00:54:43,413 --> 00:54:45,547
         Oko-maha-neea.

513
00:54:45,549 --> 00:54:47,750
      Where is my daughter?

514
00:54:50,053 --> 00:54:51,854
         Oko-maha-neea.

515
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:57,626
             Hannah!

516
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:02,164
Stop!

517
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:06,268
             Hannah!
             Sarah!

518
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,607
             Hannah!

519
00:55:11,609 --> 00:55:14,877
          Wait up! Agh!

520
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:20,783
             Sarah!

521
00:55:20,785 --> 00:55:22,751
Let her go!

522
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:25,954
              Stop!

523
00:55:32,195 --> 00:55:34,229
             Hannah!

524
00:55:34,231 --> 00:55:39,034
Hannah! Hannah!

525
00:55:39,036 --> 00:55:40,669
             Hannah!

526
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:47,710
                         Hannah!
                         Hannah!

527
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:54,717
Try to stay calm, Sarah. Okay.

528
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:58,187
     I'll call the senator.
         Thank you, Dad.

529
00:55:58,189 --> 00:56:00,089
       <i> Try to stay calm.</i>

530
00:56:00,091 --> 00:56:04,093
<i>I'll take the next plane home,</i>
<i>I'll be there tomorrow morning.</i>

531
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:09,932
He's getting
on a plane tomorrow.

532
00:56:09,934 --> 00:56:10,866
              Okay.

533
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:14,937
     Sir, you were saying...

534
00:56:14,939 --> 00:56:17,139
             Sorry.

535
00:56:17,141 --> 00:56:19,608
I was saying, it's a bit
difficult to explain,

536
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:21,310
but our daughter wasn't alone.

537
00:56:21,312 --> 00:56:22,544
     Was she with her nanny?

538
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:23,912
No, she was not
with the nanny...

539
00:56:23,914 --> 00:56:26,782
she was dragged away
by kids,

540
00:56:26,784 --> 00:56:28,317
she was dragged away
by little kids.

541
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:30,018
           Teenagers?
        No, little kids.

542
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:31,687
  They tied her up and they...

543
00:56:31,689 --> 00:56:33,088
     It was a huge storm...

544
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:34,757
with all of the lightning
and darkness,

545
00:56:34,759 --> 00:56:36,392
  it must be very disorienting.

546
00:56:36,394 --> 00:56:39,661
I know what I saw. I know what
she saw. My daughter is missing.

547
00:56:39,663 --> 00:56:41,130
Can you please just tell me
what you're gonna do

548
00:56:41,132 --> 00:56:42,064
to find her?

549
00:56:42,066 --> 00:56:44,133
I know it's hard
for parents to sit back,

550
00:56:44,135 --> 00:56:46,235
but it's too easy
to get lost in these jungles,

551
00:56:46,237 --> 00:56:48,871
especially for people
who aren't familiar with them.

552
00:56:48,873 --> 00:56:51,673
Our best people are already
out there looking for her.

553
00:56:51,675 --> 00:56:54,176
We'll do everything we can
to find her, okay?

554
00:56:54,178 --> 00:56:56,779
Trust us, we'll find your
daughter.

555
00:56:56,781 --> 00:56:59,848
Come on, boys!

556
00:57:41,858 --> 00:57:45,360
       I can't stay here.

557
00:57:45,362 --> 00:57:47,830
    I can't-- I can't do it.

558
00:57:47,832 --> 00:57:48,864
I cant wait for them
to come back and tell me

559
00:57:48,866 --> 00:57:50,165
haven't found her.

560
00:57:50,167 --> 00:57:51,300
         I can't do it.

561
00:57:51,302 --> 00:57:52,734
Well, I can't wait
around here, either.

562
00:57:52,736 --> 00:57:55,871
Yeah, but one of us
has to stay.

563
00:57:55,873 --> 00:57:57,639
Let me try and go
and do something.

564
00:57:57,641 --> 00:58:00,008
            Try what?
          I don't know.

565
00:58:05,415 --> 00:58:08,016
     I'm going to find her.

566
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:30,072
Excuse me, "Santa Clara,
Calle siete, apartamentos"?

567
00:58:30,074 --> 00:58:32,808
Yeah, it's up those stairs.

568
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:34,543
            Up there?

569
00:59:10,613 --> 00:59:11,647
Paul?

570
00:59:14,284 --> 00:59:17,519
I need your help, Catalina.
They took Hannah.

571
00:59:17,521 --> 00:59:19,655
        What do you mean?

572
00:59:19,657 --> 00:59:22,891
You said you saw something
in the jungle.

573
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:26,261
Well, so did I.
I saw it, too.

574
00:59:26,263 --> 00:59:29,565
I saw the kids
and I need your help.

575
00:59:29,567 --> 00:59:32,267
       How can I help you?

576
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:37,406
What does
"Oko-maha-neea" mean?

577
00:59:47,183 --> 00:59:50,385
This is it, this is
Oko-maha-neea.

578
00:59:50,387 --> 00:59:54,656
In Spanish it's "Aguas Rojas",
"Red Waters".

579
00:59:54,658 --> 00:59:56,658
            Let's go.

580
00:59:58,328 --> 01:00:00,996
A lot of people in this part
of town only speak Koreguaje...

581
01:00:00,998 --> 01:00:02,364
    so let me do the talking.

582
01:00:02,366 --> 01:00:04,199
       So where do we go?

583
01:00:04,201 --> 01:00:06,768
If you want to find out
what's going on around here...

584
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:09,671
     there's only one place.

585
01:00:09,673 --> 01:00:11,106
           The church.

586
01:01:49,773 --> 01:01:52,507
This church was built
on the remains of the temple...

587
01:01:52,509 --> 01:01:55,944
where the Niños Santos
were burned alive.

588
01:01:55,946 --> 01:01:57,345
That's why they bring
their statues here?

589
01:01:57,347 --> 01:02:01,416
Yes. Let me talk
to the priest.

590
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:03,852
Father, how are you?

591
01:02:03,854 --> 01:02:06,621
So good to see you!

592
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:49,564
              Wait!

593
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:53,235
              Stop!

594
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:02,110
      Where's my daughter?

595
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:13,321
              Stop!

596
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,200
              Hey!

597
01:04:32,202 --> 01:04:34,236
    What are you doing here?

598
01:04:34,238 --> 01:04:36,338
One of those kids went in there.

599
01:04:58,127 --> 01:04:59,928
             Hello?

600
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:06,501
             Hello?

601
01:05:11,141 --> 01:05:13,241
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay!

602
01:05:14,678 --> 01:05:15,844
           It's okay!

603
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:37,465
Mm-hm.
Do you have a picture?

604
01:05:37,467 --> 01:05:39,267
              Yeah.

605
01:05:41,837 --> 01:05:43,405
              Here.

606
01:05:43,407 --> 01:05:45,073
Her name is Hannah
and she was taken earlier

607
01:05:45,075 --> 01:05:46,241
tonight.

608
01:05:48,245 --> 01:05:49,678
I think your son might have
some idea what happened

609
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:50,445
to my daughter.

610
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:04,626
   Her son died 20 years ago.

611
01:06:48,537 --> 01:06:51,006
               No!

612
01:09:07,243 --> 01:09:11,312
Some nights she
still sees him, in the shadows,

613
01:09:11,314 --> 01:09:12,514
her little Daniel.

614
01:09:12,516 --> 01:09:15,083
This is the boy that I followed.

615
01:09:20,023 --> 01:09:23,458
He always listened and behaved,
but one morning he wanted

616
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:24,759
to go out to play.

617
01:09:24,761 --> 01:09:26,427
          She refused.

618
01:09:26,429 --> 01:09:29,030
 He had been sick for many days.

619
01:09:32,601 --> 01:09:39,274
Fever, rash...
same as his friends.

620
01:09:39,276 --> 01:09:43,311
        But he insisted.

621
01:09:43,313 --> 01:09:45,713
     And he never came back.

622
01:09:45,715 --> 01:09:49,284
He disappeared.
They all did.

623
01:09:49,286 --> 01:09:51,953
Now all she wants
is for someone to tell

624
01:09:51,955 --> 01:09:53,154
her what happened.

625
01:09:53,156 --> 01:09:54,722
         I'm very sorry.

626
01:09:59,396 --> 01:10:02,030
He says it
was the Niños Santos.

627
01:10:11,473 --> 01:10:13,775
Many people said
it was a curse,

628
01:10:13,777 --> 01:10:17,011
that the Niños Santos made
the children sick and

629
01:10:17,013 --> 01:10:17,845
then took them.

630
01:10:17,847 --> 01:10:19,614
  But she doesn't believe that.

631
01:10:19,616 --> 01:10:22,383
If she doesn't believe that,
then what did happen?

632
01:10:27,123 --> 01:10:29,290
The river... it was

633
01:10:29,292 --> 01:10:31,192
something in the water.

634
01:11:03,559 --> 01:11:06,527
We're running out of time.

635
01:11:06,529 --> 01:11:09,330
Tell her that my daughter
was sick, too.

636
01:11:09,332 --> 01:11:13,635
Just like her son.
What did you do?

637
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:18,973
Nobody helped us,
nobody cared.

638
01:11:18,975 --> 01:11:20,742
It was a difficult
time for them.

639
01:11:20,744 --> 01:11:24,445
And her husband lost his job
because they closed the

640
01:11:24,447 --> 01:11:25,313
paper mill.

641
01:11:25,315 --> 01:11:26,881
        What paper mill?

642
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:33,488
   The paper mill is that way.

643
01:11:35,525 --> 01:11:37,025
     The old Harriman mill.

644
01:11:42,364 --> 01:11:43,998
       I have to go there.

645
01:12:05,087 --> 01:12:06,254
             Sarah?

646
01:12:08,524 --> 01:12:09,791
          Are you okay?

647
01:12:09,793 --> 01:12:11,793
          What is this?
             Files.

648
01:12:11,795 --> 01:12:13,995
These children have the same
symptoms as my daughter!

649
01:12:13,997 --> 01:12:16,631
They all have the same
mercury poisoning.

650
01:12:16,633 --> 01:12:18,533
-What is going on here?
-I don't know.

651
01:12:18,535 --> 01:12:21,002
No, your signature
is all over them. Look!

652
01:12:21,004 --> 01:12:23,705
        Okay, let me see.

653
01:12:47,596 --> 01:12:49,897
     It's not my signature.

654
01:12:49,899 --> 01:12:51,733
What? What are you
talking about?

655
01:12:51,735 --> 01:12:56,738
It's my father's.
Look at the date.

656
01:12:56,740 --> 01:13:00,308
My father was the
company doctor at the time.

657
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:02,377
       Just like I am now.

658
01:13:07,416 --> 01:13:08,983
        That's my father.

659
01:13:08,985 --> 01:13:12,353
And where is he?
Where is he now?

660
01:13:12,355 --> 01:13:14,255
      He died 20 years ago.

661
01:14:04,573 --> 01:14:06,140
            Any news?

662
01:14:16,919 --> 01:14:19,921
I spoke to Marañon
on the way from the airport.

663
01:14:19,923 --> 01:14:22,190
The federal police
are getting involved.

664
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:30,565
What do you know
about mercury poisoning?

665
01:14:30,567 --> 01:14:34,502
Mercury poisoning?
Why?

666
01:14:34,504 --> 01:14:40,174
Nine children were sick with
mercury poisoning in 1992...

667
01:14:40,176 --> 01:14:42,977
and the company doctor
treated them.

668
01:14:57,159 --> 01:14:59,560
We had some mercury leakage
at the old mill.

669
01:14:59,562 --> 01:15:01,028
           They died!

670
01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:04,732
     We tried to save them.

671
01:15:04,734 --> 01:15:07,335
      But it was too late.

672
01:15:11,473 --> 01:15:14,208
We did what we had to do
to protect the company.

673
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:17,812
They were just children!
They have families.

674
01:15:17,814 --> 01:15:22,450
Do you think I set out
to kill these children

675
01:15:22,452 --> 01:15:23,818
deliberately?

676
01:15:23,820 --> 01:15:26,420
   Do you think I'm a monster?

677
01:15:26,422 --> 01:15:29,724
When I came here 20 years ago,
there was nothing, just a river

678
01:15:29,726 --> 01:15:30,958
and some poor fisherman.

679
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:37,365
Now they have jobs,
pensions, doctors.

680
01:15:37,367 --> 01:15:42,470
I came to this jungle
and civilized it.

681
01:15:44,974 --> 01:15:48,109
    Business is tough, Sarah.

682
01:15:48,111 --> 01:15:51,412
Difficult decisions have
to be made.

683
01:15:51,414 --> 01:15:54,916
        And sometimes...

684
01:15:54,918 --> 01:15:57,652
Sometimes there's
collateral damage.

685
01:16:00,355 --> 01:16:02,890
Hannah is sick
with mercury poisoning.

686
01:16:02,892 --> 01:16:05,426
    Is she collateral damage?

687
01:16:05,428 --> 01:16:06,694
       That's impossible.

688
01:16:06,696 --> 01:16:09,230
We have no mercury at the plant
anymore, I told you that.

689
01:16:09,232 --> 01:16:11,599
Those children took Hannah,
I'm telling you, I saw it

690
01:16:11,601 --> 01:16:12,934
with my own eyes.

691
01:16:12,936 --> 01:16:14,602
That's delusional.
Those children are dead

692
01:16:14,604 --> 01:16:15,870
and buried.

693
01:16:15,872 --> 01:16:18,606
Where are their families?
I need to speak with them.

694
01:16:20,709 --> 01:16:23,177
 Those families can't help you.

695
01:16:25,314 --> 01:16:27,214
       They know nothing.

696
01:16:29,117 --> 01:16:32,053
You never told them?

697
01:16:35,557 --> 01:16:38,326
  Where did you put the bodies?

698
01:16:55,544 --> 01:16:57,578
        Which way is it?

699
01:17:55,203 --> 01:17:57,672
              Look!

700
01:17:57,674 --> 01:17:59,507
    She's in here somewhere.

701
01:17:59,509 --> 01:18:01,442
                         Hannah!
                         Hannah!

702
01:18:01,444 --> 01:18:03,544
Hannah!
Hannah!

703
01:18:03,546 --> 01:18:05,646
             Hannah!

704
01:18:07,849 --> 01:18:09,483
             Hannah!

705
01:18:12,721 --> 01:18:15,623
          Wait! Sarah!

706
01:18:52,761 --> 01:18:55,696
     Hannah, are you there?

707
01:19:15,117 --> 01:19:17,785
   Wait! Where is my daughter?

708
01:19:17,787 --> 01:19:20,254
             Hannah!

709
01:19:36,104 --> 01:19:40,441
    Hannah! Can you hear me?

710
01:19:40,443 --> 01:19:41,609
Mermaid!

711
01:19:41,611 --> 01:19:44,845
             Hannah!

712
01:19:44,847 --> 01:19:46,614
          Mommy's here!

713
01:19:46,616 --> 01:19:48,449
Sarah!
              Paul?

714
01:19:48,451 --> 01:19:50,317
Sarah, don't move.
          It's locked!

715
01:19:50,319 --> 01:19:51,719
              Paul!
         Where are you?

716
01:19:51,721 --> 01:19:53,721
Don't move! I'm here!
      Paul, where are you?

717
01:19:53,723 --> 01:19:54,855
             Sarah!

718
01:19:57,927 --> 01:19:59,493
What are you doing here?
Are you okay?

719
01:19:59,495 --> 01:20:01,862
            Yes, yes.

720
01:20:01,864 --> 01:20:03,397
           She's here.
             Where?

721
01:20:03,399 --> 01:20:05,933
I don't know, I heard her!
I heard her somewhere.

722
01:20:05,935 --> 01:20:08,769
        I saw those kids.

723
01:20:08,771 --> 01:20:10,538
Mermaid.

724
01:20:10,540 --> 01:20:12,807
     What? Do you hear that?
              Yeah.

725
01:20:12,809 --> 01:20:16,277
             Hannah!

726
01:20:17,712 --> 01:20:19,580
Mermaid.

727
01:20:22,250 --> 01:20:25,820
Mermaid.

728
01:20:25,822 --> 01:20:28,088
             Dream!
              What?

729
01:20:28,090 --> 01:20:30,558
     Come on. It's our game.

730
01:21:43,699 --> 01:21:47,935
     Hannah? Are you there?

731
01:22:04,753 --> 01:22:08,589
Elevator.

732
01:22:08,591 --> 01:22:11,325
            Rabbits.

733
01:22:13,328 --> 01:22:15,663
Silver.

734
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:20,734
             River!

735
01:22:22,771 --> 01:22:25,506
Rock.

736
01:22:26,041 --> 01:22:27,708
              Kid!

737
01:22:33,114 --> 01:22:36,951
 Give me back my granddaughter.

738
01:22:36,953 --> 01:22:39,586
             Please.

739
01:22:39,588 --> 01:22:40,788
         Oko-maha-neea.

740
01:22:40,790 --> 01:22:44,825
She's innocent.
It's me you want.

741
01:22:56,104 --> 01:22:58,005
              Kid!

742
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:08,382
              Kid!

743
01:23:08,384 --> 01:23:10,517
Dead.

744
01:23:21,296 --> 01:23:22,629
             Hannah!

745
01:23:26,735 --> 01:23:27,901
              Dad!

746
01:23:27,903 --> 01:23:30,004
             Sarah!
             Hannah!

747
01:23:34,376 --> 01:23:37,211
       Dad! Are you okay?

748
01:23:37,213 --> 01:23:38,846
        I can't open it!
          Are you okay?

749
01:23:44,986 --> 01:23:47,821
Dad!

750
01:23:47,823 --> 01:23:50,557
      Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

751
01:23:54,095 --> 01:23:58,065
Oh, my God!
Hannah! Hannah!

752
01:24:04,105 --> 01:24:07,674
       Hannah, I'm sorry.

753
01:25:00,995 --> 01:25:02,763
      Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

754
01:25:07,903 --> 01:25:10,437
Hannah!

755
01:25:34,562 --> 01:25:37,297
    Please, please! Oh, God!

756
01:25:37,299 --> 01:25:38,532
Look at me! Look at me!
Hannah!

757
01:25:38,534 --> 01:25:40,000
     Look at me! Look at me!
         Hannah! Hannah.

758
01:25:40,002 --> 01:25:43,537
         Oh, no, no, no!
      It's okay, it's okay.

759
01:25:43,539 --> 01:25:47,574
               No!
      It's okay. It's okay.

760
01:25:47,576 --> 01:25:53,013
      It's okay, it's okay.

761
01:26:22,377 --> 01:26:25,145
          Mummy. Daddy.

762
01:26:25,147 --> 01:26:27,781
    You're okay! You're okay!

763
01:26:27,783 --> 01:26:32,119
Oh, my god.
You're okay! You're okay!
