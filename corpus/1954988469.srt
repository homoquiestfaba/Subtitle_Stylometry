Fellas, this is
Grace's brother Kevin.

Oh, hey, man.

176
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:22,229
Seriously,
it's nice to meet you.

177
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:24,331
- 'It's a pleasure.'
- Nice to meet you too.

178
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:27,267
What's up, little brother?
I'm Dion. From the bus.

179

Hey, uh, you guys

You know, get down
till the break of dawn.

184
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,147
I'm sorry, Ben. She-she
drank a little bit too much.

185
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,616
- Come on. Let's go.
- Your mom drank too much.

186
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:45,686
I know what you're saying.
I know what you're saying.

187
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:47,320
Hey, bro,
we made it to Hawaii.

188
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:48,922
So what's on the agenda?

189
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:51,158
It's my last 24 hours
before I get married...

190
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:52,960
- Yes, it is.
- Let's go hard!

- It is.

200
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:46,847
- Yeah.
- Titties.

201
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,183
- I'm ahead of you.
- What?

202
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:52,419
- They look big from up here.
- I know, right.

203
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:55,322
- Welcome to the good life.
- What are we talking about?

204
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:59,059
This is the view I always get.
I'm looking down on the titties.

205

- What?
- Yeah.

206
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:01,729

For real? Really?

209
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:07,434
Ever thought I might be at the
perfect height for motorboating?

210
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:10,237
Actually I never thought about
that. That's a good point.

211
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,505
(Ben)
One point for the little guy.
One point!

212
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:19,279
- Incoming.
- What's this?

213
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:20,714
Come on. Pop it.

214

- Yeah.

Ah!

- 'Oh, man.'
- Oh, no. Not the shirt!

217
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:28,255
I know I just
got this shirt too.

218
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,492
So I hear you got girl problems.

219
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,462
Yeah, well,
I had a girlfriend, but, uh...

220
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:36,997
But we broke up.

221
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,366
So tell me.
Did you break up with her?

222
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,201
Or did she break up with you?

223
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:43,236
Well, it was, it was mu...

224
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:46,173
Um, she broke up with me.

225
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,475
See, that's your first mistake.

226
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:51,211
You have to always
break up with them first.

227
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:54,314
Women only want
what they can't have.

228
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:58,018
Well, why would I break up
with her? I-I really liked her.

229
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,887
Exactly.

230
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,921
I'm confused.

231
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:02,422
Exactly!

232
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:05,192
That's how she
should be feeling.

233
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:06,526
- Huh?
- Huh?

234
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,862
- Oh.
- Right?

235
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:10,130
- Right?
- Right.

236
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:13,200
Okay. So, what do I do now?

237
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,235
- What's her name?
- Megan Richards.

238

239

- What?
- Man, screw Megan Richards!

taking pictures of me.

taking pictures of...

Of the sights
and the, uh, birds.

Hey, it's not polite to take
pictures of other people.

I agree. I'm... I'm sorry. I...

of a creeper.

I don't know.
Kev, what're you drinking?

I'll get like,

You know what?
This may sound kinda random.

00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:31,504
I think you'll look
really good in a suit.

No, no. I'm not
the suit type of guy.

what type of guy you are.

gotta wear a suit.

to undo your shirt, man.

make it a little more special.

- Why don't you give it to him?

It only grows in Hawaii.

the locals over 300 years ago.

Kev, we're going to Bar 35.

684
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,752
We were gonna
find the guys and go home.

685
00:34:46,785 --> 00:34:48,187
Don't worry about
the guys.

This is an island,
we'll bump into 'em.

687
00:34:50,256 --> 00:34:51,890
- I'm super tired.
- You know what?

688
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,393
I'm gonna show you
a good time. Let's go.

dance with Kevin.

Kevin, remember what I told you
about taking compliments?

And I saw you
at the strip club.

I can't dance.

your first impression of me.

first impression of me?

00:37:55,341 --> 00:37:57,809
- Um. Honestly?
- Yeah.

person that I've ever seen.

What does this hand thing mean?

have a girlfriend.

00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:08,860
- Wh-what?
- Extortion.

851
00:42:08,894 --> 00:42:10,662
[Laughs]

852
00:42:11,096 --> 00:42:13,765
Extortion?

853
00:42:13,799 --> 00:42:15,801
Hey, do you wanna come
to this after-party

854
00:42:15,834 --> 00:42:17,135
With me and my brothers?

855
00:42:17,168 --> 00:42:19,004
Uh, no, not really.

856
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:20,739
Hmm, please?

857
00:42:20,772 --> 00:42:22,273
Dante's supposed to be back.

858
00:42:22,307 --> 00:42:23,975
And we should wait for him.

859
00:42:24,009 --> 00:42:25,977
[Laughs]
Come on, Kevin, he's fine.

860
00:42:26,011 --> 00:42:28,213
It's his wedding.
I mean, he's probably gone home.

861
00:42:28,246 --> 00:42:30,215
Yeah, I should
probably go home too.

862
00:42:30,248 --> 00:42:32,050
- I mean...
- No. No. Just...

863
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:35,654
Come on. Just come
to this party with me.

864
00:42:35,687 --> 00:42:37,288
- No.
- Just nod your head.

865
00:42:37,322 --> 00:42:38,857
- Nod it that way.
- Oh!

866
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,859
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay. I'm nodding my head.

867
00:42:43,695 --> 00:42:45,196
Wooh! Thanks, man.
Uh, hey, bro.

868
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,232
Have you seen
my girl up in here?

869
00:42:47,265 --> 00:42:49,300
My girl?
What are you talking about?

870
00:42:49,334 --> 00:42:51,069
No, I mean, it's like...

871
00:42:51,102 --> 00:42:54,740
It's kinda like this girl that
I like and I think she likes me.

872
00:42:54,773 --> 00:42:56,074
- And so I...
- Like?

873
00:42:56,107 --> 00:42:57,843
Are you talking about Nikki?

874
00:42:57,876 --> 00:42:59,377
- Right now? Seriously?
- Yeah, man.

875
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:02,080
I mean, like she's tall
and she's, like blonde.

876
00:43:02,113 --> 00:43:03,849
- And she's like...
- Oh, my God!

877
00:43:03,882 --> 00:43:05,784
You like a starfish.

878
00:43:05,817 --> 00:43:08,820
I told you a hundred times
that chick is a starfish.

879
00:43:08,854 --> 00:43:10,656
She lays there
while she takes it.

880
00:43:10,689 --> 00:43:12,991
That's not cool, alright?
I doubt you've even got...

881
00:43:13,024 --> 00:43:15,060
I doubt you even
slept with her, dude.

882
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:16,327
You doubting
my abilities?

883
00:43:16,361 --> 00:43:19,030
- You're doubting my abilities?
- Yes, I am.

884
00:43:19,064 --> 00:43:22,300

[Instrumental music]

890
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:53,298
- This isn't a party.
- I know.

891
00:43:53,331 --> 00:43:56,367
I just wanted to stop and show
you my favorite place.

892
00:43:56,401 --> 00:43:59,270
- Okay.
- Come on.

893
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:04,142
* Why did it take so long
for me to realize *

894
00:44:04,175 --> 00:44:07,412
* That you were there for me
the way I was for you *

895
00:44:07,445 --> 00:44:12,217
* But those eyes
they captured me...*

896
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:16,187
- What do you think?
- It's uh, it's nice.

897
00:44:16,221 --> 00:44:19,958
Yes, so the party we're gonna go
to is, um, it's over there.

898
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:22,193
'It's by this place
called the Spitting Caves.'

899
00:44:22,227 --> 00:44:25,931
I've always wanted to jump off
the Spitting Caves actually.

900
00:44:25,964 --> 00:44:27,966
- Really?
- Yeah, I, um...

901
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:29,735
- I'm, uh...
- It's pretty scary.

902
00:44:29,768 --> 00:44:31,236
I think people
have really died.

903
00:44:31,269 --> 00:44:33,705
That's why I've always
wanted to jump off it.

904
00:44:33,739 --> 00:44:37,242
- 'Cause I'm really brave.
- Well, I had no idea.

905
00:44:37,275 --> 00:44:40,011
No, I'm kidding.
I'm actually really fragile.

906
00:44:42,047 --> 00:44:44,149
Fragile's cool, too.

910
00:45:03,969 --> 00:45:05,403
- I'm sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

911
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:07,839
- No, it's like...
- No, I'm more sorry than you.

912
00:45:07,873 --> 00:45:09,307
I should...
No, I...

913
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:12,043
We don't really know each other
that well and...

914
00:45:12,077 --> 00:45:13,444
- Yeah, I-I...
- I agree.

915
00:45:13,478 --> 00:45:14,980
I totally rushed it.
What...

916
00:45:15,013 --> 00:45:17,215
I'm so sorry. We don't really
know each other.

917

- You're right.
- No, no, it's cool.

918
00:45:19,017 --> 00:45:21,820
I mean, I'm-I'm the one who
brought you up here. Okay?

With, like this view and
everything and I, um...

920
00:45:25,323 --> 00:45:28,393
I... I...

921
00:45:28,426 --> 00:45:30,996
It's just, um, not fair.

922
00:45:31,029 --> 00:45:32,730
What's not fair?

923
00:45:33,799 --> 00:45:36,768
Um, let's just say, like...

924
00:45:36,802 --> 00:45:40,205
Guys are scared
to hit on me.

925
00:45:41,272 --> 00:45:44,042
- What?
- Here, yeah.

926
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:47,478
Why would they be scared to hit
on you? You're so nice.

927
00:45:47,512 --> 00:45:51,016
No, I...
My family...

Is scary as shit.

929
00:45:52,951 --> 00:45:55,520
Trust me.
They scare everyone away.

930
00:45:55,553 --> 00:45:57,388
Especially boys.

931
00:45:57,422 --> 00:46:00,792
- They can't be that bad.
- Yeah, they're pretty bad.

932
00:46:01,426 --> 00:46:03,061
It's annoying.

933
00:46:04,029 --> 00:46:06,297
Well... you should tell them.

934
00:46:06,331 --> 00:46:11,002
Just be like...
"I'm Kat and I like boys."

935
00:46:11,036 --> 00:46:12,503
- And...
- Just like that?

936
00:46:12,537 --> 00:46:16,307
Just like that. You know, if
they love you, they'll listen.

937
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:20,545
Maybe you're right.

938
00:46:21,346 --> 00:46:23,048
Maybe I'm...

939
00:46:23,081 --> 00:46:26,317
* Oh oh oh oh oh...

940

They do love me.
They just...

941
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:34,225
They have a funny way
of showing it.

942
00:46:34,259 --> 00:46:36,594
* But I'll say these words...

I don't think
you know what it means.

956
00:47:14,299 --> 00:47:17,002
And why do you keep
taking off my clothes?

957

alcohol at this party?

stripped down by a psychopath.

things could be worse.

you stand out.

You look like
one fucking tourist.

a tourist to the party for?

in the vein of party time.

it was cool, man.

00:58:58,903 --> 00:59:01,939
This whole night was all
a set-up, you take me out.

1183
00:59:01,972 --> 00:59:05,209
You take me to strip club,
I almost get my balls blown off.

1184
00:59:05,242 --> 00:59:07,244
I almost got my balls
blown off, too.

1185
00:59:07,277 --> 00:59:09,914
Oh, your balls.
I don't care about your balls.

1186
00:59:09,947 --> 00:59:13,584
I wish they got blown off so you
won't flirt with Suzy all night.

1187
00:59:13,618 --> 00:59:17,321
- You know what, whatever.
- How can you have cold feet?

1188
00:59:17,354 --> 00:59:19,757
Yeah, whatever, you don't even
know what you're talking

1189
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:21,191
About right now. You've
everything ass-backwards.

1190
00:59:21,225 --> 00:59:24,061
- Ass-backwards. Your ass...
- 'Ow!'

1191
00:59:24,094 --> 00:59:27,097
- Your ass abandoned me.
- I did not abandon you.

1192
00:59:27,131 --> 00:59:30,735
I was outside the bar, and I got
kidnapped by the two henchmen.

1193
00:59:30,768 --> 00:59:32,269
Yeah, kidnapped.

1194
00:59:32,302 --> 00:59:35,339
They threw me in the back
of a van like a terrorist

1195
00:59:35,372 --> 00:59:37,775
And then they stripped me
again, me and Suzy.

1196
00:59:37,808 --> 00:59:40,745
They tied us in some weird
sexual position.

1197
00:59:40,778 --> 00:59:44,649
Alright, so you got kidnapped
outside the bar.

1198
00:59:44,682 --> 00:59:51,021
Yes, yes, the two crazy, scary,
Samoan henchmen kidnapped me.

1199
01:00:06,971 --> 01:00:08,305
Ah!

1200
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:26,857
So those crazy guys tied you up
and took off your clothes again?

1201
01:00:26,891 --> 01:00:29,694
Yes, that's what I've been
trying to tell you.

1202
01:00:29,727 --> 01:00:31,896
Why-why do they keep
taking off your clothes?

1203
01:00:31,929 --> 01:00:33,664
Be...
I don't know.

1204
01:00:33,698 --> 01:00:38,402
I don't have any clue
why those big Samoan dudes

1205
01:00:38,435 --> 01:00:41,105
Want to see me
in my underwear, man.

I am so sorry,
I just wanted to take you out

1209
01:00:49,246 --> 01:00:52,416
And show you a good time,
and I totally screwed up.

1210
01:00:52,449 --> 01:00:53,851
Don't be sorry, man.

1211
01:00:53,884 --> 01:00:55,085
This whole night...

1212
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:57,121
It's like a,
it's like a sign.

1213
01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:59,089
'Like a bad sign
for my wedding.'

1214
01:00:59,123 --> 01:01:00,324
A bad sign?

1215
01:01:00,357 --> 01:01:02,059
I mean,
maybe Benjamin's right.

1216
01:01:02,092 --> 01:01:03,761
Maybe I have cold feet.

1217
01:01:03,794 --> 01:01:05,195
I mean,
the whole Suzy thing.

1218
01:01:05,229 --> 01:01:07,364
I mean,
I almost got you killed.

1219
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:09,834
- Did you sleep with Suzy?
- No.

1220
01:01:09,867 --> 01:01:11,468
Could you have slept with Suzy?

1221
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:13,137
Yes, definitely.

1222
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:14,805
- But you didn't, right?
- Right.

1223
01:01:14,839 --> 01:01:16,807
And why didn't you sleep
with Suzy?

1224
01:01:16,841 --> 01:01:19,844
- B-because I...
- Be-because...

1225
01:01:21,912 --> 01:01:23,347
Oh!

1226
01:01:25,816 --> 01:01:27,151

married today, right?

I got a call from Nikki

in a fight at a strip club.

- Why would she tell you that?
- You are crazy.

yourself killed.

but, you know...

to be the responsible one.

No, you can't even take care
of my little baby brother.

- He did take care of me, Grace.

the whole night, so when...

for so long.

I...

1317

It's just, Grace doesn't
trust me anymore.

to trust you again. You have to.

about last night. Are you crazy?

Don't do anything...

1322
01:06:12,536 --> 01:06:14,038

of what happened last night.

your brother and I...

of a strip club to the streets

Of China Town
by these gangsters.

1329
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,202
I mean, drug dealers.
They were drug dealers.

1330
01:06:45,235 --> 01:06:48,705
- They did drugs.
- We got into a fight with...

1331
01:06:48,738 --> 01:06:50,807
- Samoan dudes.
- Two Samoan dudes.

1332
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,376
And we lost.

01:06:52,409 --> 01:06:54,611
I got,
I got a goos punched in.

1334
01:06:54,644 --> 01:06:57,247
And then, they-they made us
jump off this 80-foot cliff.

1335
01:06:57,281 --> 01:07:00,050
And, and we nearly got
our balls blown off.

1336

I, myself ended up
slightly castrated.

1337

- What?
- Don't worry.

1338
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:08,092
- My balls are okay.
- 'Mine, too.'

1339
01:07:08,125 --> 01:07:09,193
We're, they're...

1340
01:07:09,226 --> 01:07:10,260

Conjoined.

1341
01:07:10,294 --> 01:07:12,462
That's what
the doctor told us.

1342
01:07:12,496 --> 01:07:16,500
So, but being that I almost
got my balls blown off

1343
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:19,303
I realize that
I take you for granted, and...

1344
01:07:19,336 --> 01:07:22,439
Hold that,
you're telling me

1345
01:07:22,472 --> 01:07:26,443
You put Kevin
through all of this...

1346
01:07:26,476 --> 01:07:28,445
I know it sounds crazy.

1347
01:07:28,478 --> 01:07:31,281

to show him a good time.

about myself, and...

if you don't marry him, 'cause...

Dante my brother.

I have no doubt in my mind
