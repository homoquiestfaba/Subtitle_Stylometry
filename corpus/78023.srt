00:00:57,824 --> 00:01:00,884
<i>Here in the upstate, things don't</i>
<i>change much.</i>

2
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:02,617
<i>Fall means football season.</i>

3
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:05,287
<i>Being married to a coach</i>
<i>means measuring things...</i>

4
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:07,592
<i>...mainly by wins and losses.</i>

5
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:10,199
<i>Except for that one year.</i>

6
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,561
<i>Jimmy Carter declared</i>
<i>that if elected...</i>

7
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:16,038
<i>...he would do everything possible</i>
<i>to clean up the government.</i>

8
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:20,645
<i>In South Carolina weather, late night</i>
<i>and early morning low clouds....</i>

9
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,270
-Come on, let's go.
-No, Mom.

10
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:18,259
What's wrong with you, boy?!
Get out of my way!

11
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:19,960
Damn!

12
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,593
Laird, son, how many years
you been playing for me?

13
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:56,494
-Two years, coach.
-You want to make that three?

14
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:59,604
-l suggest you start paying attention.
-Yes, sir.

15
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,000
We do things as a team, gentlemen.

16
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:07,709
One player doesn't execute, it's the
difference between 6 yards or 6 points.

17
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:12,348
Honeycutt, what say we do
some up-downs as a team...

18
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:14,986
...so we can further appreciate
that concept.

19
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:18,988
You heard the man!
Get them feet chopping now!

20
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,224
Get it up nice! Get those knees up!

21
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,724
Get them legs going!

22
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:27,064
Get it up!
Get it up, right now!

23
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,715
Come on, get them up! Get them up!
Get them up!

24
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,789
Let's go! Come on, now!

25
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:12,667
Hey, you.

26
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:18,609
Now, might any of those X's and O's
be for me tonight?

27
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,213
-How's it coming?
-Almost done.

28
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:29,888
Mary Helen home yet?

29
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,165
Mary Helen's been in bed
for an hour, Harold.

30
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:41,206
Y'all do have a week before you
actually have to play this game, right?

31
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:44,205
-Right.
-l'll be right up.

32
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:48,805
Ah, the first ''l'll be right up''
of the season.

33
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,142
<i>Ready! Set!</i>

34
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:52,709
<i>Hut!</i>

35
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,108
Let's go, now.

36
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:03,822
Team, full speed! Live to the ball!

37
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,358
Ready!

38
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:12,798
Blue, 2 4!

39
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:14,228
Set!

40
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:32,785
Hey, Einstein. Why don't you try
picking the ball up.

41
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:35,358
Yeah, you, dummy. What, you deaf?

42
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,552
Yeah, pick it up. There you go.

43
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,895
Throw it over here.

44
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:43,462
Come on, throw it!

45
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,568
What are you doing? Hey, coach!

46
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:52,909
He took our ball.

47
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:56,737
Wha--?

48
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:59,146
Run it again!

49
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:24,502
-See you tomorrow.
-Okay. See you later, Mary Helen.

50
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,138
Bye.

51
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:33,647
You're getting home late.

52
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,788
Oh, hey, Daddy.

53
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:39,287
l tried calling a couple times,
but the line was busy.

54
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:40,925
Your mama's asleep.

55
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,493
l'll talk to her in the morning, okay?

56
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:45,386
All right.

57
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,797
-Night.
-Good night.

58
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,267
Heard Mary Helen made
varsity cheerleader.

59
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:59,309
-She's really excited.
-l'll bet. l'll bet Linda is too.

60
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,377
Yeah, l guess so.

61
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:03,946
Do it again!

62
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,719
-One more time!
-You got them running something?

63
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:08,876
Hit it!

64
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:12,184
Come on, dope.

65
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,222
-Hey, boy!
-Watch this. Watch this.

66
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:21,763
-Bring them in.
-Gather up! On the double!

67
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:31,566
Well, is someone gonna
tell me what's going on here?

68
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,649
How about it, Johnny?

69
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,746
Nobody move.

70
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:46,481
On, no, no, no, no.

71
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,254
Oh, gee.

72
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,963
l just want to help you.

73
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,238
l'm just gonna cut the tape off you.

74
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:07,837
You've gotta hold still.
Just try to hold still, now.

75
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,345
You gotta hold still. Look at me.

76
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,486
Hold still. l'm not gonna hurt you.
Hold still. l don't want to cut you.

77
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,850
My God. lt's all right.

78
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,958
Calm down a little bit. lt's okay.

79
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,857
l got it. Gonna get you
out of this mess.

80
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,588
Okay, you're free.

81
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,044
Anybody got anything to say?

82
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:56,120
Tell your folks practice's gonna
run late tomorrow.

83
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,005
Mary Helen tells me the cheerleading
squad's got itself...

84
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:10,904
...what, half-a-dozen new faces
this semester, isn't that right?

85
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:14,369
l also hear the athletic director...

86
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:17,607
...has to take the top spot
on the pyramid at pep rallies.

87
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,580
lsn't that right?

88
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:24,749
Harold, why not stop by and see what
kind of no-good your daughter's up to?

89
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:25,946
Yeah, sure.

90
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:32,322
You got a couple phone calls, Daddy.

91
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:34,890
From who?

92
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:39,966
Bobby Taggert's folks. Frank Clay.
l wrote them down for you.

93
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:44,003
-What'd you tell them?
-That you'd call back.

94
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:48,510
Have you decided what you're
gonna do about these boys?

95
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,247
Not yet.

96
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:55,213
l'm sure most of them have never
done anything like this before.

97
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:59,051
You didn't see the look
on this young man's face, Linda.

98
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,256
He was terrified.

99
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,270
Coach Jones?

100
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:19,235
Go on. Good idea.

101
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:21,470
Might l have a minute of your time?

102
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:24,272
Y'all, excuse me.

103
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:28,582
Anybody ever said no to you on that,
Principal Daniels?

104
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:30,915
Nobody still working here.

105
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:34,458
He scores!

106
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:38,854
-What can l do for you?
-l hear we had an incident yesterday.

107
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:41,465
Yes, ma'am, we did.

108
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,294
You taking care of it?

109
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:48,530
Let's just say today's practice won't be
the shortest one we've ever had.

110
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:50,833
Good. Good.

111
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,102
You know, Harold...

112
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:57,146
...that boy has been rolling by here
for a long time now...

113
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:58,839
...minding his own business.

114
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:02,179
Never caused any problem
for anybody.

115
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,856
l need you all to keep it that way.

116
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:10,084
l appreciate it.

117
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:46,127
No, l don't want the football.

118
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:51,499
l just want to tell you l'm sorry
about what happened.

119
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:55,773
l thought you needed to hear that
from someone.

120
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:59,570
l don't want the football.
You keep it.

121
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:03,909
Why don't you bring it by practice
later.

122
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:07,210
l'll find you something to do.
Maybe you can help us out.

123
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:14,984
Nothing more is gonna happen, son.

124
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:16,752
l promise you.

125
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:24,925
See you later. All right?

126
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,661
All right, the nine of you.

127
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:51,591
You know who you are.

128
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:54,756
Get on down there.

129
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:58,130
Take your shoulder pads off.
Line up on the chalk.

130
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,201
Let's go. Hustle up!

131
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:03,969
Well...

132
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,337
...what do you want to do?

133
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,241
Run them.

134
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:09,944
How long?

135
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:14,542
Till l say stop.

136
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,859
On the line now!
Where you're going to be.

137
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,350
Ready.

138
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,459
All the way to the line, coach.

139
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:48,047
Don't quit on me now!
Don't you quit on me!

140
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,020
All the way through that line!
All the way through!

141
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:38,826
-Hi.
-Hey.

142
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,172
-Long day?
-Yeah.

143
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:51,072
How was yours?

144
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:52,978
Long.

145
00:15:55,721 --> 00:16:00,283
So the report is that Mary Helen
got off to a great start in lit class...

146
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:04,553
-...but she's struggling with math.
-Well, the lit part sounds good.

147
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:08,194
Come on, Harold.

148
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,892
lt's bad enough when a parent
misses a conference.

149
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:13,196
lt's worse when the parent's
a teacher.

150
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:16,863
The parent's a teacher,
he knows how his kid's doing.

151
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:21,702
What?

152
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:25,548
Please just tell me
that you forgot to go.

153
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:28,083
You know l had to deal
with those boys.

154
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:30,187
Oh, those boys.

155
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:33,387
Can't you make room
for your daughter and those boys?

156
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:37,962
Don't lecture me. l'll go see Ms. Marks
tomorrow if it'll make you feel better.

157
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:41,599
Make me feel better?
This is not about me.

158
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,129
She's a junior, Harold.

159
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:51,069
l mean, she's got this year
and next.

160
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:53,267
And then she's gone.

161
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,251
Go!

162
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:07,750
-Y'all ready?
-Yes, sir!

163
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,260
Yes, sir!

164
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:12,654
Close your eyes for a minute.

165
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,258
l want you to listen.

166
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,136
You hear that?

167
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:23,771
lmagine what that'll sound like
after we've all done our job tonight.

168
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:26,775
And then...

169
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,242
...l want you to imagine what
that's gonna feel like.

170
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,652
l want you to picture your man
right across from you.

171
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,187
You see him?

172
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:43,490
You make the effort on every play,
you'll beat them.

173
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:46,790
You play smart,
you're gonna outthink them.

174
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,263
You play with heart and character...

175
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:52,493
...and give your teammates everything
you've got on every play...

176
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:56,368
...you can walk off the field calling
yourselves a football team.

177
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:03,880
Let's play with Hanna pride and never
stop believing in each other.

178
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,078
You win your battles...

179
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,416
...we'll win our war.

180
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:11,717
What's say let's have some fun
and get it done.

181
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:18,854
<i>Your Hanna Yellow Jackets!</i>

182
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,660
Let's go, Jackets!

183
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,962
<i>The kickoff is high and deep...</i>

184
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:30,802
<i>...and sends the Jackets' Johnny Clay</i>
<i>back near the goal line.</i>

185
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:36,213
<i>Johnny Clay behind a convoy of Hanna</i>
<i>blockers. Heads up the right sideline.</i>

186
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,848
Go! Go! Go! Go!

187
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:39,372
Get up there!

188
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:42,042
<i>Finally knocked out-of-bounds</i>
<i>at the 42-yard line.</i>

189
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,314
Throw right 63 flag. Come on.

190
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,479
Come on!

191
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:47,386
<i>First and 1 0 for the Jackets.</i>

192
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,325
<i>Marcum back to pass.</i>

193
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:52,826
<i>Finds Hawkins in the right flat</i>
<i>for another Jacket first down.</i>

194
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:55,260
Get over here. Come on. Come on.

195
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:57,529
Thirty-six crossbuck.

196
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:01,604
Once you get the ball, l don't wanna
see nothing but the back of your jersey.

197
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,604
All right. Get out there.

198
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,041
<i>The handoff is to Clay.</i>

199
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:10,409
<i>Finds a big hole. Now cuts outside.</i>
<i>Beats one tackler. And another.</i>

200
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:14,279
-Get upfield, son. Turn it on!
-<i>He may go all the way.</i>

201
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,546
-<i>Touchdown, Hanna!</i>
-Yeah! All right.

202
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,983
<i>Johnny Clay with a 30-yard run</i>
<i>gives the Jackets the lead!</i>

203
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:25,328
-<i>Less than two minutes to play.</i>
-That's what we want.

204
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:30,830
That's a 30-yard run, son!

205
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:35,766
That's our ball game!
That's our ball game!

206
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:00,860
-Evening, fellas.
-Hey, coach.

207
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:02,693
-Harold.
-Honeycutt.

208
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:04,368
Del. Don.

209
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,869
Kurt. Dennis.

210
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,100
Just brewed that pot 1 0 minutes ago,
coach. Got yourself the first cup.

211
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:12,504
All right.

212
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:20,106
Well...

213
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,054
...didn't exactly thump them...

214
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:28,056
...but it wasn't too bad
as far as season openers go.

215
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,785
Frank, your boy, Johnny,
had a heck of a run.

216
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:33,454
Give him the ball,
he'll make you a smart man.

217
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:34,788
That's right.

218
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:37,900
Did notice a few things
we need to work on.

219
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:41,470
You reckon these are the boys
gonna take us back to state?

220
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:45,109
Come on, Clive. Little early
for that kind of talk, isn't it?

221
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:48,404
l hear Easley has a pretty
decent crop of speed this year.

222
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,980
l guess we'll see about that
next week.

223
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:53,810
Think you might want to throw
the ball a bit more?

224
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:55,613
l think about a lot of things.

225
00:20:55,821 --> 00:21:00,986
Listen, boys. Last thing coach needs
is us asking him a slew of questions.

226
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:04,594
Especially after how he got
those young men to play.

227
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:06,593
We got them revved up, didn't we?

228
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,825
So how do you plan on beating those
Easley boys Friday night?

229
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:12,798
Well, Frank, if l was to tell you
that...

230
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,168
...y'all wouldn't have a thing to talk
about all week.

231
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,045
Boy, that's a good cup tonight, Del.

232
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:26,411
Thank you.

233
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:30,886
Come on, turn it up! Turn it up!
Turn it up!

234
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,725
Good job! Good job!

235
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,630
Hey, Honeycutt.

236
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:45,027
Yeah?

237
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:46,795
See that young man over there?

238
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,932
What do you figure he wants?

239
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:51,698
l don't know.

240
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:54,411
Come on, Spaulding,
bring it around there!

241
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,780
l think maybe he's thirsty.

242
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:04,248
Well, go on.

243
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:13,490
All right. Five minutes.

244
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:16,361
Get yourself a drink.
Get on special teams.

245
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:23,974
How you doing?

246
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:27,475
Yeah, you. No, wait, wait.
lt's all right.

247
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,977
Settle down. l ain't gonna
give you a hug.

248
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,174
Just got a little water here. See?

249
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,843
l'm dropping something off here.

250
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:38,985
Little something from Coach Jones.

251
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:41,748
Got a name, son?

252
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:46,189
You ain't gonna talk to me, are you?

253
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,094
All right.

254
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:50,894
Go ahead. Go on, give it a squeeze.

255
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:57,004
Set! Hut!

256
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:04,579
-Come on, now!
-Good job, Justin.

257
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:13,452
All right, bring it in!

258
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:25,464
Hi.

259
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:30,531
Glad you came by.

260
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:41,808
Thank you. What's your name?

261
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:50,384
Why don't you come on in.

262
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:54,223
l got some hamburgers coming.

263
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:56,230
Get your buggy. Come on in.

264
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,884
Really good burgers.

265
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:46,213
Oh, you found some music
you like. Good.

266
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:54,592
Hey, look who's here.

267
00:24:58,463 --> 00:25:00,226
No ketchup, no onion.

268
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:01,625
Thank you.

269
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:06,599
-He tell you his name yet?
-He doesn't talk too much.

270
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:09,738
But he's sure taken a liking
to that radio of yours.

271
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:12,809
Radio.

272
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:15,911
Radio, huh?

273
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:22,751
You know, it's just sitting there.

274
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:25,321
You can have it as far
as l'm concerned.

275
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,048
Hey, you hear that...

276
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:29,056
...Radio?

277
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:33,858
Coach Honeycutt says you can take
that home with you if you like.

278
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:35,491
Hey, are you hungry?

279
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,099
Would you like a hambur--?

280
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:48,202
You want something to wash it
down with too? Root beer? Coke?

281
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,006
Coke.

282
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,952
-Man knows what he wants.
-Coke, it is.

283
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,470
Well...

284
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:26,476
...which way's home, Radio?

285
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,638
There's nothing wrong
with a good country station.

286
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,443
But l can get used to this too,
l guess.

287
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:10,757
You know, the boys call me
Coach Jones.

288
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,286
Coach Jones.

289
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:16,592
You can call me what you like
when you get around to it.

290
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:19,259
All right?

291
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:44,721
l hope you can come by practice
tomorrow.

292
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:47,591
The same time. All right?

293
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:58,406
See you then, okay?

294
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:01,672
Afternoon, ma'am.

295
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:06,544
l'm Harold Jones. l coach the football
team over at Hanna High.

296
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:11,847
l was just giving your boy
a ride home.

297
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:15,857
Come on in now, baby.

298
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,715
Look.

299
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:46,151
Hey.

300
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,415
-Hello.
-Yeah.

301
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:51,720
-Look.
-l see you got yourself another one.

302
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:52,988
Look.

303
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:55,992
Oh, look at that.

304
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:58,560
You get that from him?

305
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:02,203
Yeah. Coach Jones.

306
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:07,235
Look at that one.

307
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,377
He a nice man?

308
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,614
Yeah.

309
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:13,773
Good.

310
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:18,282
l think it's time you got washed up
for dinner. You hungry?

311
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:21,891
-Yeah.
-l made you some fried bread.

312
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,962
All right. Get yourself washed up
for dinner.

313
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:33,271
Set!

314
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,499
Set!

315
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,265
Get in there! Get in there!

316
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:42,238
Bring it in! Come on, hustle up!
Let's go.

317
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,574
Come on, hustle up!

318
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:47,941
Bring it in. Good job. Good job.
Good practice, men.

319
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,747
We got a lot to think about this week.

320
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:53,389
Easley's got a ton of speed.

321
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:58,453
Defense, containment. We gotta
keep them from getting outside.

322
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:02,861
Offense, ball control. We'll grind it
out, keep their offense off the field.

323
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:06,697
Now, there's one other thing.

324
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:08,771
See the young man over there?

325
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:13,744
Believe some of you already
know him. He goes by Radio.

326
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:16,137
He'll be helping us out for a while.

327
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,876
We will not have a problem with that.

328
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:22,712
No, sir.

329
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,046
Call it up, Danny.

330
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:32,357
-One, two, three!
-Beat Easley!

331
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:43,030
-What's he doing?
-That's it. Get your knees up.

332
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:45,973
Look at him out there.

333
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:48,805
That one! That one!
That one!

334
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:53,206
Careful.

335
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:55,116
Sorry.

336
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,056
l'm sorry, Johnny.

337
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:03,750
l'm sorry. l'm sorry, Johnny.
l'm sorry.

338
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:04,984
You okay.

339
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,361
Hanna!

340
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:15,561
Hanna!

341
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:17,898
Hanna!

342
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:22,910
What the hell is going on out there?

343
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:26,515
<i>Yellow Jackets still looking to</i>
<i>get on track. Marcum back to pass.</i>

344
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:28,208
<i>Intercepted!</i>

345
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:16,399
Don't quit! Don't quit!
Don't quit!

346
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:21,838
Go! Go!

347
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,925
That was a good one.
l liked that one.

348
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,601
Radio!

349
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:55,702
Hi, everybody. Hi, everybody.
Hi, everybody.

350
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:06,208
Quite a show you put on tonight.

351
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:10,353
Just wondering if you were running
a football program or a social club.

352
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:35,539
Radio, l need to talk to your mama.
That okay?

353
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:38,508
She right there.

354
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:46,652
-Hi, Mama.
-There's a sandwich in there for you.

355
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:50,757
-l'll be in there directly.
-Okay, Mama.

356
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,196
Ma'am.

357
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:04,774
l was wondering if we might carry
your son tomorrow on the team bus.

358
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:06,374
Got us a football game.

359
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:10,076
What your boys done to my son
was wrong...

360
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:12,511
...but l don't expect you
to make up for it.

361
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:15,652
The boys are taking to him real good.

362
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:18,653
They're still boys, now, ain't they?

363
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,990
l'll keep a good eye on him.

364
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,427
l guess it's all right with me.

365
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:32,233
l don't mean to pry, ma'am...

366
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,663
...but l was hoping...

367
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:39,540
...l might be able to ask you
what exactly is wrong with him.

368
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,941
Well, the doctors never could
give me a name for it.

369
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:48,312
Say he the same as everybody else,
just a little slower than most.

370
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:51,818
l got a older boy, Walter.
He's fine and all.

371
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:54,923
And their daddy?

372
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:02,765
He died a while back.

373
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:05,962
l'm sorry.

374
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,437
You got your hands full.

375
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:14,172
Well, they got me working 1 0 hours
a day at the hospital. Some days more.

376
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:17,677
So l'm wondering where he's at
half the time...

377
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:20,008
...and worrying all the time.

378
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:23,584
Because l figure they only gonna need
one excuse to put him away.

379
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:31,393
James is a good boy, coach.
He got himself a good heart.

380
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:34,928
Most folks just don't take the time
to see it, is all.

381
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:36,527
James.

382
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:40,529
James Robert Kennedy.

383
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,868
Thank you, ma'am.

384
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:53,610
<i>No, he is not getting on that bus.</i>

385
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:56,252
Harold, he is not a student.

386
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:59,283
You don't even know how old he is.

387
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:02,323
Look, he has a handicap
we know nothing about.

388
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:04,961
What if he has some kind
of a seizure?

389
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,461
He's not the one who's
gonna have the seizure.

390
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:09,691
This has nothing to do
with any of that.

391
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:12,097
lf you're saying
l'm overly concerned...

392
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:15,899
...about my students being with
a severely handicapped black man...

393
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:17,802
...l assure you that l am.

394
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:21,206
But my concern is not necessarily
for my students.

395
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:26,210
l'm not so sure we're trying to help
somebody here...

396
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:29,911
...or whether he's being used as
nothing more than a glorified mascot.

397
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:33,880
You know me a hell of a lot
better than that.

398
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:42,566
Put your game face on.

399
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:47,228
Wipe your smile off your faces.
Start thinking about football.

400
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:51,139
-Coach Jones. lt raining hard.
-Radio. Radio.

401
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:53,242
-Gonna be wet out there.
-lt sure is.

402
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:56,845
Listen, we're not gonna be able
to take you on the bus today.

403
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:02,713
Some folks, they don't think
it's a good idea.

404
00:37:03,187 --> 00:37:06,623
They just don't understand yet,
but they'll catch on. Believe me.

405
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:08,556
l'm sorry.

406
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,950
l'm really sorry.

407
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:15,592
l'll see you tomorrow. Okay?

408
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:38,246
<i>And in local sports...</i>

409
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:41,880
<i>...Hanna's Yellow Jackets travel</i>
<i>to Wade Hampton tonight.</i>

410
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:45,392
<i>With a 4-4 record, they need to win</i>
<i>both their remaining games...</i>

411
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:47,861
<i>...to keep their playoff hopes alive.</i>

412
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:52,399
<i>Clock winding down now</i>
<i>in the fourth quarter.</i>

413
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:55,061
<i>The Yellow Jackets have trailed</i>
<i>all night long...</i>

414
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:59,539
<i>...but now within striking distance,</i>
<i>trailing 1 4 to 1 3.</i>

415
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:06,875
<i>Danny Marcum barks out the signals.</i>

416
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:08,952
<i>He's back to pass.</i>

417
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,415
<i>Incomplete.</i>

418
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:23,266
<i>Second down now.</i>
<i>Still time to mount one last drive.</i>

419
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:25,935
<i>And there's the draw play.</i>
<i>Playing up the middle.</i>

420
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:29,470
<i>To 5, 1 0. First down, Jackets.</i>

421
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:35,578
<i>Jackets will go for a field goal</i>
<i>to win it.</i>

422
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,711
<i>Less than a minute to play.</i>

423
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:49,721
-<i>Here's the snap. The kick.</i>
-Kick.

424
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:52,423
<i>No good!</i>

425
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:57,257
<i>The Jackets' last-ditch efforts</i>
<i>fall short.</i>

426
00:38:57,468 --> 00:39:02,064
<i>Final score: Wade Hampton, 1 4,</i>
<i>Hanna, 1 3.</i>

427
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:16,344
Here, here. Use a spoon.

428
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:17,814
There you go.

429
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:21,321
-l'll get some of these out of your way.
-All right.

430
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:22,548
Thank you, Grace.

431
00:39:22,893 --> 00:39:25,589
-Which cobbler you got today?
-l got so--

432
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,931
-l'm not done.
-Don't talk with your mouth full, now.

433
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:34,234
-Peach and blackberry.
-Peach and blackberry.

434
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:36,338
What's it gonna be, Radio?

435
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:37,496
Both.

436
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:42,173
Give the man both. l'd like some
more coffee too, please.

437
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,847
Yeah, l take both.

438
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,374
-Radio, look at me.
-l want my pie.

439
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:50,577
You got mustard on your cheek.
Get it for you.

440
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:52,278
There you go.

441
00:39:57,628 --> 00:39:59,459
Football season's just about over.

442
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,824
-You know that, don't you?
-One more game.

443
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,865
Yep. One more game.

444
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,798
You gonna be okay with that?

445
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:15,172
-Where my pie?
-Don't worry, they're coming.

446
00:40:15,379 --> 00:40:17,540
She'll bring you your pie.
Don't worry.

447
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:20,342
-l like both.
-She's got your order.

448
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:25,622
Football. l like football.

449
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:30,860
Some of us felt pretty bad about
leaving you off that bus last night.

450
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,565
We're gonna find a way
to make it up to you.

451
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:38,993
How you gonna do that, coach?

452
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:48,306
<i>Your Hanna Yellow Jackets!</i>

453
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:53,347
Jackets!

454
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:57,383
All right!

455
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:07,625
-We're having fun. This is a good one.
-This is a good one.

456
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:11,268
<i>Nothing like archrival Westside</i>
<i>to get Jackets fans stirred up.</i>

457
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,302
<i>Winning this one would even Hanna's</i>
<i>record at 5 and 5...</i>

458
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:16,871
<i>...and though a far cry</i>
<i>from early season hopes...</i>

459
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:19,771
<i>...salvage a measure of pride</i>
<i>for the home squad.</i>

460
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:25,073
Here we go. Here we go.

461
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:27,944
All right, 4 right,
2 4 flank and reverse.

462
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:31,019
-<i>Third and 6 on the 40.</i>
-That was a good one, coach.

463
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:33,349
-We'll see.
-Ready!

464
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:35,149
That was a reverse! Reverse!

465
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:36,587
Reverse!

466
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:37,818
Come back here.

467
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,622
What--?
He's telling the play!

468
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:43,231
<i>Westside defense calling an audible,</i>
<i>brings in both linebackers.</i>

469
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,061
-Danny, check it off.
-Reverse!

470
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:48,467
<i>Jones signaling for time, but Marcum</i>
<i>doesn't hear him.</i>

471
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:51,802
<i>Marcum rolls right, pitches it</i>
<i>to Hill on a flank and reverse.</i>

472
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:56,309
<i>He is crushed in the backfield</i>
<i>and fumbles the ball.</i>

473
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:59,449
-<i>It's recovered by Westside!</i>
-Daggum it!

474
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:01,275
Come on.

475
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,118
No wonder! They knew the play.
They knew the play!

476
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:08,382
Defense, get out there.

477
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:12,961
Radio, listen to me. You can't let the
other team know what we're gonna do.

478
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:15,955
-How they know that, coach?
-Tommy, get out there!

479
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:17,497
Good God.

480
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,464
Set! Hike!

481
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:22,037
<i>Snead back to pass for Westside.</i>

482
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:26,774
<i>It's broken up, but a flag is thrown</i>
<i>on the Jackets' cornerback.</i>

483
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:28,241
No!

484
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:30,812
-Got him in the back, coach.
-Are you kidding?!

485
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:34,473
-You blew that call and you know it.
-You need to move back.

486
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:38,587
-Don't do it. Don't do it.
-That was a chickenshit call.

487
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:40,518
-Fifteen more!
-Oh, come on!

488
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,316
<i>Another penalty on Jones.</i>

489
00:42:42,526 --> 00:42:46,553
-Chickenshit! Chickenshit!
-Fifteen more. Go to the white line.

490
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:48,391
Chickenshit! Chickenshit!

491
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:51,727
-Radio! Get him out of there, Honeycutt!
-Get him back.

492
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:53,493
Unsportsmanlike conduct!

493
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:56,265
<i>Just called a third penalty</i>
<i>on the Jackets' bench.</i>

494
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:58,498
lt looks like a train wreck
down there.

495
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:00,768
Honeycutt, get him off the field.

496
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:04,509
How many flags you got?!
You got any more flags?!

497
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:07,548
-Get him back!
-<i>A total of 45 yards now on the play.</i>

498
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,742
-There goes my evening.
-Come on, Radio.

499
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,081
Let's go, buddy. Here we go.

500
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:20,520
Any chance l can get the ball?

501
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:23,461
Nobody speaks in here
unless Coach Jones says he does.

502
00:43:23,701 --> 00:43:25,191
Sit down, Clay.

503
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,730
There your ball.

504
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:39,409
Now that we got that taken care of....

505
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:47,651
<i>Jackets trying to hold Westside</i>
<i>in the fourth quarter.</i>

506
00:43:47,858 --> 00:43:51,487
<i>They've stiffened here in the second</i>
<i>half and still trail by only 4.</i>

507
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,196
<i>Here comes the Jackets' blitz.</i>

508
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:58,665

<i>The ball will go back to the Jackets</i>

Good job. Come here.

516
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:29,498
Hey, Honeycutt...

517

...l got a good feeling about this one.

518
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:33,962
Good feeling. Good feeling.

519
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,637
Set! Hut!

521

527
00:45:08,272 --> 00:45:12,140
That's the way the game's
supposed to be played. Good job.

528
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:20,345
Settle down, now. Listen up.

529
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:24,480
That was a great team effort out there
tonight. Great comeback.

530
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:27,555
Y'all played your hearts out.
l'm proud of you. Good job.

531
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:30,351
Honeycutt.

532
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:34,656
For standing behind us all season long,
especially tonight...

533
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:36,628
...the game ball...

534
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:38,691
...goes to Radio.

535
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:56,016
-Can you sign this?
-Yeah, sure.

536
00:45:58,689 --> 00:46:00,680
-There you go.
-Thanks.

537
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:03,356
-Hey. How are you?
-Much better now.

538
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:06,963
Yeah? You want me to bring
this home tonight?

539
00:46:07,164 --> 00:46:08,529
You only got one of them?

540
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:11,758
-l had a lot to choose from, didn't l?
-No kidding, huh?

541
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:15,461
-You going over to the shop?
-l suspect so. Shouldn't be too painful.

542
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:20,099
Well, don't forget to bring some of
that unsportsmanlike conduct home.

543
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:21,937
All right.

544
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,413
-Evening, fellas.
-Harold.

545
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:31,418
-lrv. Clive.
-Nice win tonight, coach.

546
00:46:35,092 --> 00:46:39,188
-l'll make us a fresh batch.
-Well, this will be fine, Del.

547
00:46:42,766 --> 00:46:47,829
Well, l know a .500 season
isn't what we all had in mind...

548
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:51,132
...but l did see some things tonight
l think we can build on.

549
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:54,707
The boys made good adjustments
at halftime...

550
00:46:54,878 --> 00:46:57,574
...and Danny Marcum finally got
the offense moving.

551
00:46:57,748 --> 00:46:59,739
-He sure did.
-He sure did, coach.

552
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:02,682
l'm real proud of all the boys.

553
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:08,222
Always good to beat Westside,
and it's nice to win the last one.

554
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:11,693
Wasn't long ago
we were winning most every one.

555
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,623
There something you need
to say, Frank?

556
00:47:16,867 --> 00:47:17,891
Well...

557
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:22,964
...l think we got too good a team
to be losing half our games.

558
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:30,003
Anybody else?
