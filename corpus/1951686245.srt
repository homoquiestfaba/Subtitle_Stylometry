There's a tiny door
in my office, Maxine.

It's a portal,
and it takes you inside John Malkovich.

You see the world
through John Malkovich's eyes...

Oh, he's an actor. He's one of the great
American actors of the 20th century.

00:31:59,122 --> 00:32:02,208
He's very well respected.
Anyway, the point is...

this is a very odd thing.

389
00:32:05,255 --> 00:32:08,221
It's supernatural,
for lack of a better word.

I mean, it raises
all sorts of philosophical-type
questions, you know...

00:32:12,429 --> 00:32:15,836
about the nature of self,
about the existence of a soul.

Is Malkovich Malkovich?

393

I don't have it anymore.
Where is it?

395
00:32:25,616 --> 00:32:28,101
Did it disappear?
How could that be?

396
00:32:28,181 --> 00:32:32,390
Is it still in Malkovich's head?
I don't know!

can of worms this portal is?

00:34:03,736 --> 00:34:07,544
because Lestercorp's open

working a lot of late nights.

Oh, yes, Dr. Lester.
Absolutely.

No reason.

Do you think that it's kind of weird
that John Malkovich has a portal?

Do you think that it might have
some sort of significance, for example?

I think it's kind of sexy
that John Malkovich has a portal.

485
00:39:32,327 --> 00:39:34,892
Sort of like
it's like he's a vagina.

486
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:37,137
It's sort of vaginal,
like he has a--

he has a penis and a vagina.
