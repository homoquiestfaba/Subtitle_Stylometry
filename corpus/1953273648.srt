1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,320
Octonauts, to your stations. 

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,080
Barnacles! 

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,520
Kwazii! 

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,080
Peso! 

5
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,400
- Explore! 
- Rescue! 
- Protect! 

6
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,200
I wonder what those little lights are up ahead. 

7
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,200
Shellington? 

8
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,840
It could be a group of tiny firefly squid, Captain. 

9
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,440
They glow in the dark. 

10
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,760
- Dim the lights to get a better look. 
- Already on it, Captain. 

11
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,920
I can't tell what they are for certain. 

12
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,760
They're not moving. 

13
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,080
Then let's get a little closer. Closer... 

14
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,400
CRASH! 

15
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,960
- Jumping jellyfish! 
- Dashi, put us in reverse and pull away. 

16
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,640
I'm trying, Captain, but... Something's got us. 

17
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,880
- CRASH 
- Switch to steering wheel mode, now! 

18
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:45,080
Argh! Mustn't...break...free! 

19
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,880
Oh! Oh, dear! 

20
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,400
Miaow! Mioaw! What? 

21
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,160
Shiver me whiskers! 

22
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,000
Flappity flippers! 

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,720
Ooooh! Argh! 

24
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,160
CHIRRUPS 

25
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,240
It's no good, we held tight. Dashi, lights. Let's see what got us. 

26
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,600
Aye-aye, Captain. 

27
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,960
It's an enormous eye! 

28
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,960
The little lights around my eyes fooled you, didn't they? 

29
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,000
You didn't know they belonged to big, old me. 

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,760
We mean you no harm. Please, let go of us at once. 

31
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,280
No! 

32
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,800
I grab it, I keep it, you weird looking squid. 

33
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,400
- Dashi, slam the Octo-Alert. 
- Whoa! 

34
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,600
Octonauts, to the HQ! 

35
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,840
Shellington, any idea what's grabbed us? 

36
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,760
Yes, it's a colossal squid. 

37
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,640
It's like my cousin, the giant squid, only bigger. 

38
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,880
It's the biggest squid in the ocean! 

39
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,200
I wish it would stop shaking us! 

40
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,160
No more shaking. 

41
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,080
Phew, that was easy. 

42
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,440
Time for squeezing! 

43
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,600
Yar! He'll crush the Octopod! 

44
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,600
We'll match him tentacle for tentacle. Tweak? 

45
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,920
I've got just the thing, Cap. 

46
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,600
Wearing this tentacle suit, Professor Inkling will be able 

47
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,400
to move the arms of the Octopod as if they were his own. 

48
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,840
- Wow! 
- I'm not good at pushing buttons 

49
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,680
but I'm an expert at tentacle wrestling. 

50
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,400
Excellent! Activate tentacle suit! 

51
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,840
Ee-haw-pow! 

52
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,520
Twist to the side. 

53
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,120
Now, down. 

54
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,720
That's it! 

55
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,600
Ha! You're swashbuckling like a proper pirate, Professor. 

56
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,920
Oh, my! I need to break free before he gets his hooks in us. 

57
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,720
- Hooks? 
- What hooks? 

58
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,240
The squid has hooks on the ends of his tentacles. 

59
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,680
So it's quite a challenge to get away from him. 

60
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,760
Almost there. Just a few more twists and turns and we'll be... Argh! 

61
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,280
Ink cloud! A classic move from the squid playbook. 

62
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,280
Oh, no! I can't see where his tentacles are. 

63
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,120
That's right! Eat my ink! 

64
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,400
I'm taking you down. 

65
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,000
Way down! 

66
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,040
CHIRRUPS 

67
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,280
I'm afraid he's hooked us. 

68
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,520
Understood. Kwazii, to the launch bay. 

69
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,400
Here's the plan. We'll swim outside and use our paws... 

70
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,200
To pry those hooks off the ship. 

71
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,880
Ha! These hooks are no match for a swashbuckling pirate! 

72
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,040
For each hook we loosen, two more move into place. 

73
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,680
This will take all my polar bear strength. 

74
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,280
- Got it! 
- Captain, incoming tentacle! 

75
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,520
- Thanks, Kwazii. 
- Any time. 

76
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,160
Better keep moving. 

77
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,160
There's something heading straight for us. 

78
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:52,600
It's a pod of sperm whales. And sperm whales love to eat colossal squid. 

79
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,080
Ooh, I don't like the sound of that. 

80
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,160
If the sperm whales eat the colossal squid... 

81
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,720
...they might bite the Octopod, too! 

82
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,320
It's every squid for himself. I'm getting out of here! 

83
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,920
Stop holding on to me. Let go! 

84
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,880
You're the one hooked on to us. 

85
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,440
I'm stuck. I'll never get away from the sperm whales 

86
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,400
if I can't move fast enough. 

87
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,200
The sperm whales are getting closer. 

88
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,240
We're doomed! 

89
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,040
We'll keep you and the Octopod safe from the sperm whales. 

90
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,280
Octonauts, prepare all GUPS for launch. 

91
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,240
There you are, our colossal dinner! 

92
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,440
Octonauts, let's do this! 

93
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,680
- SQUID: 
- Oh, hey! This is fun. 

94
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,720
- Everyone, pull up! 
- Uppy, up, up, up, up. Ooh! 

95
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,240
- Now, back down. 
- Oh, down! Weee! 

96
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,400
Whoa! 

97
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,400
They're still chasing us. 

98
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,080
Yes, Peso. But, sperm whales breathe air, so sooner or later, 

99
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,240
they'll have to swim to the surface to breathe. 

100
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:24,200
- WHALE: 
- Can't...keep...going. Must...go up for air. 

101
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:30,720
- Good work, Octonauts. 
- Oh, thank you! You guys saved me. 

102
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,040
I'm sorry about almost crushing your ship and stuff. 

103
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,520
No harm done. Well, not much, anyway. 

104
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,960
Let's help you unhook yourself from the Octopod. 

105
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:47,520
No, no, you just take it easy. Really, I can do it. 

106
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,560
Ooph! Ooph! Ooh! 

107
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,800
Watch out. Your hooks are digging in deeper. 

108
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,960
Just a little tentacle trouble, that's all. 

109
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,040
Are you sure you don't need help? 

110
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:05,160
Hold your seahorses, I can do it. I'll just brace myself... 

111
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,360
..and give it a good, strong...YANK! 

112
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,640
- No! 
- Oops, sorry. 

113
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,760
Tunip and the Vegimals are in there! 

114
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,040
They're sinking fast! 

115
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,760
We've no time to lose. Everybody, dive! 

116
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,360
It's too dark. I can't see the pod. 

117
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,960
I see it! I see it! 

118
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,760
You're pulling me paw, it's too dark down here to see. 

119
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,000
I have the biggest eyes in the ocean. 

120
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,480
I can see just fine without light. 

121
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,920
Let's use your squid vision. Where are they now? 

122
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:59,360
I'm looking... I'm looking... 

123
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,000
Uh-oh! Down! Go down! 

124
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,640
Everyone, dive! 

125
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:12,280
- Not that way, the other way! 
- Bring the GUPS around. 

126
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,520
Hurry! They're heading for some sharp rocks. 

127
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:22,000
You've got a free tentacle, reach out now and grab them if you can. 

128
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,200
All right, I think I got it. 

129
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,960
- Oh! I got it. 
- Octonauts, pull up. 

130
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,960
Well done! Sometimes, a spare tentacle comes in handy. 

131
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,120
CHIRRUP! 

132
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:47,440
I'm great at grabbing but I have a hard time letting go. 

133
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,840
I could use some help after all. 

134
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,440
Operation Untangle-Tentacles begins now. 

135
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,040
Now your tentacles are where they belong, 

136
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,080
it's time to return one of ours. Tweak? 

137
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,840
OK, big guy. Bring up the pod. 

138
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,200
That's it, up a little more. 

139
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,680
Wee! 

140
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,960
Down a little. Little more. Now to your left. 

141
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,320
To your other left. 

142
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,160
- Got it! 
- Super super! 

143
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,640
Good work, everyone. 

144
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,360
I think this calls for a tentacle bump. 

145
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,080
Yeah! 

146
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,960
- Easy, now. 
- Watch the hooks, matey. 

147
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,560
Ha-ha-ha! 

148
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,440
