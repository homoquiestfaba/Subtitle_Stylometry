00:00:49,615 --> 00:00:52,018
<i>I didn't really have
your typical upbringing.</i>

3
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:55,789
<i>I mean, I did at first,
but then the world ended.</i>

4
00:00:55,921 --> 00:00:57,590
<i>I don't think anyone
was really shocked.</i>

5
00:00:57,723 --> 00:01:01,126
<i>We always thought it might,
and then it just finally happened.</i>

6
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:04,932
<i>But how it happened,
now that's where it gets interesting.</i>

7
00:01:05,531 --> 00:01:06,833
<i>Agatha 616.</i>

8
00:01:06,965 --> 00:01:09,434
<i>Yep, an asteroid
heading straight for Earth.</i>

9
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,237
<i>I know. So obvious.</i>

10
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,906
<i>So, humanity came together,
and we did what we do best.</i>

11
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,575
<i>We shot a bunch
of rockets at it!</i>

12
00:01:15,707 --> 00:01:17,843
<i>And we blew it up!
And it was great!</i>

13
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:21,112
<i>But it wasn't. You see,
the thing that makes rockets rockets...</i>

14
00:01:21,246 --> 00:01:22,816
<i>chemical compounds,
a lot of 'em.</i>

15
00:01:22,948 --> 00:01:26,319
<i>Which rained back down on us,
and everything changed.</i>

16
00:01:26,451 --> 00:01:28,820
<i>And by "everything,"
I mean cold-blooded creatures.</i>

17
00:01:28,954 --> 00:01:32,290
<i>And by "changed," I mean mutated
and started eating us to death.</i>

18
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:38,031
<i>Ants, lizards, roaches, crocodiles.
You name it. There's a lot of 'em.</i>

19
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:46,705
<i>I knew this one kid who was eaten in his
sleep by a goldfish he won at a carnival.</i>

20
00:01:46,838 --> 00:01:49,242
<i>Man, Todd loved that goldfish.</i>

21
00:01:50,775 --> 00:01:53,111
<i>And that cat.</i>

22
00:01:53,245 --> 00:01:56,015
<i>So, for most of human history,
if you wanted to kill a cockroach,</i>

23
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:57,551
<i>all you needed was a shoe.</i>

24
00:01:57,683 --> 00:01:59,551
<i>Well, suddenly
you needed a shotgun.</i>

25
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:01,821
<i>And sometimes even a tank.</i>

26
00:02:01,954 --> 00:02:03,822
<i>And sometimes
even that doesn't work.</i>

27
00:02:03,956 --> 00:02:07,326
<i>Especially if you don't stay
in the tank, Bob.</i>

28
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:12,264
<i>Eventually, the really big ones and
our military took each other out.</i>

29
00:02:13,532 --> 00:02:18,304
<i>We lost 95% of the human
population in about a year.</i>

30
00:02:18,437 --> 00:02:20,238
<i>That's a lot of Bobs.</i>

31
00:02:20,372 --> 00:02:21,506
<i>And a lot of Todds.</i>

32
00:02:22,608 --> 00:02:26,079
<i>Those of us who survived,
we hid anywhere we could...</i>

33
00:02:26,211 --> 00:02:29,881
<i>bunkers, caves, panic rooms,
all around the world.</i>

34
00:02:30,015 --> 00:02:33,852
<i>So for the last seven years I've
been living in an underground bunker.</i>

35
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,022
<i>It's not as bad
as it sounds. Really.</i>

36
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,527
<i>It's a great group of people,
and we all love each other.</i>

37
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:43,996
<i>It's kinda what I imagined
college would have been like.</i>

38
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:47,300
Are you sure he's asleep?

39
00:02:47,432 --> 00:02:48,935
Who?

40
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:51,304
- Joel. Who else?
- Yeah. He's asleep.

41
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:54,140
- Hang on. Shh.
- He's not awake.

42
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:55,907
- Are you sure?
- It's just you.

43
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:57,843
I just... I don't...

44
00:02:57,978 --> 00:03:00,379
Joel. Joel.

45
00:03:01,146 --> 00:03:03,917
See?
He's not awake.

46
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,850
It's just you.

47
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:08,288
<i>Dear Aimee,
I am wide awake.</i>

48
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,691
<i>I've just gotten good at not
really moving or breathing.</i>

49
00:03:13,592 --> 00:03:15,429
<i>Being stuck in a survival
bunker with a bunch of people</i>

50
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:18,831
<i>who have all found their
soul mate is less than ideal.</i>

51
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:21,366
<i>Karen and Ray got together
a few months ago,</i>

52
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,536
<i>so they're still kinda
in their honeymoon phase.</i>

53
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:26,506
<i>It is super physical.</i>

54
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,777
<i>Good for them. They're both very
attractive and apparently quite flexible.</i>

55
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:33,478
<i>Hey, life's short.
Especially down here.</i>

56
00:03:33,612 --> 00:03:35,448
- Oh. Hey, Ava.
- Hey, Joel.

57
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,751
- Joel. How's it going?
- It's going good, Tim.

58
00:03:38,884 --> 00:03:41,721
- How are you... How are you doing?
- Yeah, good.

59
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:43,155
Cool.

60
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:46,658
- I couldn't sleep.
- Yeah, we know the feeling.

61
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:49,295
Yeah. Probably not
for the same reasons.

62
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:53,199
Y-You guys's, uh, door's open.
Is that... Did you know that?

63
00:03:53,332 --> 00:03:55,268
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we know.

64
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:57,402
Okay.

65
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:59,139
<i>After Tim's parents were
eaten by a swarm of termites,</i>

66
00:03:59,271 --> 00:04:01,807
- <i>he and Ava became inseparable.</i>
- Okay. Good night.

67
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:03,742
- <i>In every way.</i>
- Good night.

68
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:07,781
That's the asteroid
they named 616 Agatha.

69
00:04:07,913 --> 00:04:10,716
And these are all the chemical
bombs they sent up to try and...

70
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:13,319
<i>So, pretty much
everyone's coupled up down here.</i>

71
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:16,723
<i>Our first baby was born last winter.
It was super emotional.</i>

72
00:04:16,855 --> 00:04:18,625
<i>Welcome to the apocalypse, kid.</i>

73
00:04:18,757 --> 00:04:21,026
<i>The food sucks. At least you'll
never know what you're missing.</i>

74
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:24,530
<i>Kala and Connor got together
after Carol died.</i>

75
00:04:24,663 --> 00:04:27,733
<i>Carol was a cow who ate a
box of laundry detergent.</i>

76
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:31,304
<i>And now we only have one cow.</i>

77
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,672
<i>Her name's Gertie.</i>

78
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:34,274
<i>Gertie is great.</i>

79
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,175
<i>Gertie's not
our only food source.</i>

80
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,079
<i>We actually have a hunting
party that brings back</i>

81
00:04:39,211 --> 00:04:40,947
<i>whatever they can
from the surface.</i>

82
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:45,151
<i>It was easier in the beginning, you
know, before we ran out of bullets.</i>

83
00:04:45,283 --> 00:04:47,887
<i>Facing down one of those things
with a janky handmade weapon</i>

84
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,989
<i>is no walk in the park.</i>

85
00:04:50,122 --> 00:04:51,324
<i>Or so they tell me.</i>

86
00:04:51,456 --> 00:04:54,060
<i>I-I don't go
on the hunting parties.</i>

87
00:04:54,192 --> 00:04:56,161
<i>They need me in the kitchen.
I'm kinda the, uh...</i>

88
00:04:56,295 --> 00:04:58,129
<i>...the chef of the bunker.</i>

89
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:00,066
<i>Everyone likes my minestrone.</i>

90
00:05:01,466 --> 00:05:05,069
<i>Being the only single person in
the bunker has its perks too.</i>

91
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:06,673
<i>I get to hang out with Mavis.</i>

92
00:05:06,805 --> 00:05:10,276
<i>Of course, she's not much
for conversation anymore.</i>

93
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,846
<i>Her core battery's shot,
just like every other Mavis, I'd imagine.</i>

94
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,849
<i>Actually never seen
a working one.</i>

95
00:05:29,327 --> 00:05:31,362
<i>Sure wish you were here, Aimee.</i>

96
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,699
<i>I'd love for you
to meet everyone.</i>

97
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,301
Oh, yeah.

98
00:05:35,434 --> 00:05:37,903
<i>Maybe we could do a little
target practice together.</i>

99
00:05:38,036 --> 00:05:39,839
<i>It's kinda my thing.</i>

100
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,209
<i>Well...</i>

101
00:05:44,276 --> 00:05:46,345
Sorry, Mavis.

102
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,891
Hustle, hustle, people.
We gotta move.

103
00:06:00,024 --> 00:06:02,596
Guys!

104
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:06,366
Guys! I got the weapons.

105
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:08,368
- Stay.
- What?

106
00:06:09,499 --> 00:06:10,469
- Get what you need, and let's go.
- What's happening?

107
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:11,638
What's going on?

108
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,538
- We're breached.
- Breached?

109
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:15,240
- Joel.
- What do you mean?

110
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:16,676
Like,
inside the bunker breached?

111
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,377
That's what "breached"
means, kiddo.

112
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:22,547
Breached.

113
00:06:23,682 --> 00:06:26,485
Anna Lucia and I will engage.
Anderson and Tim, flank us.

114
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:29,889
Flank 'em, yeah, okay.
Where do you guys need me? The rear, or...

115
00:06:30,021 --> 00:06:31,257
I thought
we were past this, Joel.

116
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,859
Past what?
You need help. I can help.

117
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:34,994
- Let me help.
- You gonna make me say it?

118
00:06:35,127 --> 00:06:37,663
- Say what?
- You can't handle it, Joel.

119
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:39,665
- You're shook.
- Okay, yeah.

120
00:06:39,798 --> 00:06:42,435
- So, you guys don't get scared ever?
- We get scared.

121
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:45,237
We all get scared, Joel,
but you get really scared.

122
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:47,539
- We're not trying to make you feel bad.
- We love you, Joel.

123
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:48,907
But you're unsafe.

124
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,443
- You're a liability.
- Even on supply runs.

125
00:06:51,576 --> 00:06:53,446
Okay, why did that speech
feel so rehearsed?

126
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:57,149
Connor.

127
00:06:57,283 --> 00:07:00,186
Okay, 30 meters out. Let's move.

128
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:09,996
- Be careful, Connor-Bear.
- I will, Kala-Bee.

129
00:07:17,803 --> 00:07:19,505
Load out.

130
00:07:23,074 --> 00:07:25,077
Go with them.

131
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:36,622
They're getting close.

132
00:07:42,327 --> 00:07:44,162
Shit.

133
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,798
Oh, my God.

134
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,468
- It's got one of 'em.
- What about the others?

135
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,002
They're coming back.

136
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,204
Joel!

137
00:07:51,336 --> 00:07:53,738
They need help. I'm going.

138
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,975
Joel! Wait!

139
00:08:50,028 --> 00:08:52,264
Connor?

140
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:54,667
Connor.

141
00:09:57,062 --> 00:09:59,298
Did I shoot it, or did you?

142
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:02,235
What do you think?

143
00:10:04,035 --> 00:10:05,370
You.

144
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,910
<i>Oh, and I have a pretty
severe freezing problem.</i>

145
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:13,712
<i>But I am working on it.</i>

146
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:29,562
- How is it looking?
- I think it looks really good.

147
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:31,263
- Does it look like me?
- Yeah.

148
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:34,834
Are you sure that
this pose looks natural?

149
00:10:34,966 --> 00:10:36,335
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

150
00:10:36,467 --> 00:10:38,437
I think it's really good.

151
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:40,339
What are you doing?
Don't move.

152
00:10:40,471 --> 00:10:42,908
- Will you let me see it?
- Don't... Don't move. Aimee.

153
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,377
I really wanna see it.

154
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:46,077
Can I see it?

155
00:10:46,211 --> 00:10:48,313
Okay.

156
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:50,014
Okay.

157
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,884
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

158
00:10:57,856 --> 00:10:59,158
What do you think?

159
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,463
Why do I have a beard?

160
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:05,465
No, that's shading.
I did the shading.

161
00:11:05,597 --> 00:11:08,233
My head is... is so large.

162
00:11:08,366 --> 00:11:11,737
- You have a big head.
- And my hand is so tiny.

163
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,404
You have tiny hands.

164
00:11:14,105 --> 00:11:16,075
I love it. I frickin' love it.

165
00:11:16,207 --> 00:11:19,577
That's super sweet, 'cause it's terrible.

166
00:11:19,711 --> 00:11:21,646
- I got you something too.
- What?

167
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:25,650
I don't know if
these are the right ones.

168
00:11:25,784 --> 00:11:29,053
No way. These are the ones
that I-I-I wanted to get.

169
00:11:29,187 --> 00:11:30,557
- Really?
- Yeah.

170
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,127
Ooh. Hello.

171
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,895
- What's happening right now?
- Uh...

172
00:11:37,028 --> 00:11:40,032
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm dancing with my shoulders.

173
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,734
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

174
00:11:57,549 --> 00:11:59,885
This has been the best summer
of my life.

175
00:12:00,852 --> 00:12:02,287
Mine too.

176
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:07,793
Uh-oh.

177
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,695
What are you doing?

178
00:12:09,828 --> 00:12:13,965
- Do you know what time it is?
- Uh, I think it's, like, 6:30.

179
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,302
Aimee, you're...
you're scaring Crocodile Carl.

180
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:19,405
Okay, look away, Crocodile Carl.

181
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:22,240
Oh. Look away.
Hey, I get it.

182
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,875
I get it.

183
00:12:35,386 --> 00:12:36,989
We need to go.

184
00:12:37,956 --> 00:12:39,524
I'm scared.

185
00:12:54,706 --> 00:12:58,110
<i>Dear Aimee, This week
has been especially shitty.</i>

186
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:01,681
<i>We lost Connor to what
looked like a really big ant.</i>

187
00:13:04,549 --> 00:13:06,418
<i>Helps me to draw them.</i>

188
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:08,486
<i>I try to capture their essence,</i>

189
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,057
<i>scribble down some notes
on how to kill them.</i>

190
00:13:13,158 --> 00:13:14,526
<i>Sometimes I think
it's the only way I know</i>

191
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:16,461
<i>how to cope with these things.</i>

192
00:13:22,033 --> 00:13:24,702
This is 7045. Come in, 3022.

193
00:13:24,836 --> 00:13:27,706
I repeat, come in, 3022. Over.

194
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,642
<i>This is 3022.
What is it now, Ray?</i>

195
00:13:30,775 --> 00:13:33,945
Hey, Janice. No, it's actually...
It's, uh, Joel.

196
00:13:34,846 --> 00:13:37,482
- <i>Oh. Joel.</i>
- Yeah.

197
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:39,418
<i>All right.
Hold on one second.</i>

198
00:13:39,551 --> 00:13:41,552
<i>Aimee, it's Ray!</i>

199
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:44,023
It's Joel.
Thanks, Janice.

200
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:48,394
- <i>Joel! Hey!</i>
- Hey, Aimee! Hi!

201
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:50,763
- How are you?
- <i>Hi. Yeah, I, uh... I'm good.</i>

202
00:13:50,895 --> 00:13:53,932
- It's so good to hear your voice.
- <i>I'm so sorry.</i>

203
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:57,336
<i>I heard on the open frequency
that one of you guys got killed.</i>

204
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:59,504
Yeah. Breached the bunker.

205
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:01,940
<i>Wow. Actually got inside?</i>

206
00:14:02,073 --> 00:14:06,010
Yeah. It's the first time it's happened.
It was kinda scary.

207
00:14:06,144 --> 00:14:08,346
<i>Did you have to fight it too?</i>

208
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,817
Yeah. Yeah, a little.

209
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,052
I had to fight it
a little bit.

210
00:14:13,184 --> 00:14:15,820
Actually got super ripped since
the last time you saw me, so...

211
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:18,424
<i>Oh. Wow!</i>
<i>Super ripped, huh?</i>

212
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:23,128
Yeah, I was kidding. I'm not super ripped.
That was just a bad joke.

213
00:14:23,261 --> 00:14:25,497
<i>Well, I'm glad you're okay.</i>

214
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:28,466
Thanks. Yeah.

215
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,204
<i>I am still kinda blown away that you were
even able to find my colony on this thing.</i>

216
00:14:32,337 --> 00:14:33,871
I know.
It's pretty crazy.

217
00:14:34,005 --> 00:14:36,775
'Cause I found it on the first one.
What are the odds?

218
00:14:36,908 --> 00:14:38,543
<i>Crazy.</i>

219
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:42,281
Yeah. No, I... I called...
I called, like, 90.

220
00:14:44,115 --> 00:14:48,354
- Hey, you know what I, uh... know what I wish sometimes?
- <i>What?</i>

221
00:14:48,486 --> 00:14:52,924
That I could, like, s-snap my fingers
and be back in that car with you.

222
00:14:55,293 --> 00:14:56,728
Man, that'd be nice.

223
00:14:56,861 --> 00:14:59,397
<i>Yeah. Too bad it's, uh...</i>

224
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:02,734
<i>you know, impossible.</i>

225
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:05,905
<i>Kinda feels like everything
is impossible these days.</i>

226
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:09,808
<i>Taking care of this whole
colony is exhausting.</i>

227
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:13,846
I, uh...
I-I write you letters.

228
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:16,516
<i>Really?</i>

229
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,485
Yeah. Yeah,
I-I write you letters sometimes.

230
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:22,855
- <i>Aw!</i>
- All the time.

231
00:15:23,488 --> 00:15:25,157
<i>I'd love to read 'em.</i>

232
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:28,127
Really? I would love to read them to...

233
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,062
No. Aimee?

234
00:15:33,264 --> 00:15:35,599
Aimee?

235
00:15:45,977 --> 00:15:48,814
<i>We've lost
a lot of people over the years.</i>

236
00:15:51,015 --> 00:15:54,120
<i>You'd think you'd get numb
to it after a certain point.</i>

237
00:15:57,288 --> 00:15:58,723
<i>You don't.</i>

238
00:16:04,796 --> 00:16:07,299
- I'm sorry.
- Thank God! Where have you been, Joel?

239
00:16:07,432 --> 00:16:10,501
We have to go right now.
Say your goodbyes, get in the car.

240
00:16:10,635 --> 00:16:12,304
- I should go.
- Maybe you should come with us.

241
00:16:12,437 --> 00:16:15,908
No, my mom is waiting. I'm sorry.

242
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,210
Get in the car!
Aimee, you need to hurry home now!

243
00:16:18,342 --> 00:16:20,779
- I want you to have this.
- What? This is Crocodile Carl.

244
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,346
It's your good luck charm.

245
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,216
- Be careful.
- You too.

246
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,027
Aimee.

247
00:16:37,028 --> 00:16:38,264
I love you.

248
00:16:40,097 --> 00:16:41,199
I love you too.

249
00:16:42,433 --> 00:16:44,002
I'm gonna come find you.

250
00:16:45,136 --> 00:16:46,605
You better.

251
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:57,548
<i>You better.</i>

252
00:16:57,682 --> 00:16:59,350
I wanna know how it got in.

253
00:16:59,484 --> 00:17:02,321
It appears to have ripped
through one of our perimeter defenses.

254
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:03,923
What,
it ripped through steel?

255
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:05,923
Anderson and I resealed
the breach point and the vent.

256
00:17:06,057 --> 00:17:07,359
Nothing's getting
in that way again.

257
00:17:07,492 --> 00:17:08,594
But why did it happen?

258
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:09,961
It was a freak occurrence.

259
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:11,630
There's no reason to think
it'll happen again.

260
00:17:11,763 --> 00:17:15,199
We should try to stay calm.

261
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:18,137
How far away is Aimee's colony?

262
00:17:18,836 --> 00:17:20,972
- What?
- Aimee's colony.

263
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,377
- How far away is it?
- About 85 miles.

264
00:17:24,509 --> 00:17:25,778
How long does that take
to get there?

265
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:27,813
You're not actually thinking
of going?

266
00:17:27,945 --> 00:17:30,782
Tim, just... humor me.

267
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:35,153
- How long?
- Seven days. Minimum.

268
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:39,325
An armed and trained hunting party would
be lucky to last 50 miles on the surface.

269
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,826
But you, Joel...

270
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:44,028
All right, now I need volunteers

271
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:46,163
to help reinforce
some of the outer perimeter.

272
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:49,634
Yeah, I'm gonna go.

273
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:51,202
- Ava's got this.
- Exactly.

274
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:52,738
I'm gonna go.

275
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,144
It's an impossible journey,
Joel.

276
00:18:00,545 --> 00:18:02,214
No, I'm serious.

277
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:07,318
I love you guys,
but there's one person in this world

278
00:18:07,452 --> 00:18:09,320
who ever truly made me happy,

279
00:18:09,454 --> 00:18:11,656
and she's only 85 miles away.

280
00:18:11,789 --> 00:18:13,893
And I'm gonna go see her.

281
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:17,096
Whew.

282
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:19,097
That felt awesome.

283
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,866
<i>Dear Aimee,
I am done hiding.</i>

284
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,068
<i>I'm done waiting
for things to get better.</i>

285
00:18:24,202 --> 00:18:26,904
<i>It's time to take matters
into my own hands.</i>

286
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:29,875
<i>Time to let someone else
make the minestrone.</i>

287
00:18:31,042 --> 00:18:33,711
<i>I'm taking a radio, even though
it doesn't have power.</i>

288
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:35,381
<i>But I'm gonna take it anyway.</i>

289
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:38,283
Wish me luck, Gertie.

290
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,451
Mavis, take care of her.

291
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:42,688
You're not joking,
are you?

292
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,057
Nope. Nope, I'm not.

293
00:18:45,723 --> 00:18:47,092
He's not joking.

294
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,962
We're not letting you leave,
Joel. You're needed here.

295
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:52,964
Tim, no, I'm not. Come on.
I don't do anything.

296
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:57,403
Joel, that's not true. You fix the radio.
You make the minestrone.

297
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:00,706
Okay.

298
00:19:00,838 --> 00:19:02,707
Doesn't sound as important
when I say it out loud.

299
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,675
I appreciate you trying.
Really, I do.

300
00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:07,111
I just don't feel like
I belong anywhere.

301
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:10,682
I don't really wanna die all alone
at the end of the world, so...

302
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:21,125
Look, I know you guys all just think
of me as, like, some little, pathetic,

303
00:19:21,626 --> 00:19:23,461
adorable hedgehog.

304
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:25,096
But I can take care of myself.

305
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:28,334
I'm actually probably a lot
stronger than you might think.

306
00:19:30,234 --> 00:19:33,238
- We made you a map.
- Thanks, Karen.

307
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,577
Just... take care.

308
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:42,881
- Everything will try to kill you.
- Oh.

309
00:19:43,013 --> 00:19:45,183
Be observant.
Use the advantages that you have.

310
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:47,719
- You're fast and small, so...
- Right.

311
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,722
- Don't fight. Just run and hide.
- Don't fight.

312
00:19:52,657 --> 00:19:54,225
Thanks, Ray.

313
00:19:55,326 --> 00:19:57,829
You're an asshole
if you get eaten.

314
00:20:05,569 --> 00:20:08,139
- Okay.
- Nice.

315
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:11,376
I love you guys. Tell Aimee
I'll see her in seven days.

316
00:20:11,509 --> 00:20:13,878
- We believe in you.
- Love you, buddy.

317
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:04,663
Where am I?

318
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:06,964
Well, it's not super useful.

319
00:21:07,531 --> 00:21:08,666
Okay, well, you know what?

320
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,269
We know we gotta head west.
Right?

321
00:21:12,003 --> 00:21:14,772
Well, let's just... do that.

322
00:21:14,905 --> 00:21:17,143
Start with something easy. West.

323
00:21:20,144 --> 00:21:22,381
Nope, it's this way.
West is this way.

324
00:21:28,753 --> 00:21:30,288
Shit.

325
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:33,092
Split the difference.
Go this way.

326
00:21:33,858 --> 00:21:36,060
Done. First decision made.

327
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,882
<i>Dear Aimee,
I am doing it.</i>

328
00:21:58,016 --> 00:21:59,618
<i>I'm really doing it!</i>

329
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:03,055
<i>Honestly, I thought it'd be way worse.
So far, it's not too bad.</i>

330
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:06,692
<i>I've seen a lot of signs
of death, but no actual death.</i>

331
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,561
<i>So cross your fingers.</i>

332
00:22:10,327 --> 00:22:11,896
Oh.

333
00:22:12,029 --> 00:22:13,298
Monster eggs.

334
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:15,599
<i>Trying to stay positive.
Weather's nice.</i>

335
00:22:15,732 --> 00:22:19,337
<i>Getting some fresh air.
What else can I tell ya?</i>

336
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:24,276
Cool.

337
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,879
Wham-O...

338
00:22:28,012 --> 00:22:31,081
No.

339
00:22:31,215 --> 00:22:33,817
Run and hide.

340
00:22:33,951 --> 00:22:37,355
Hide in the house.
Hide in the house.

341
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:07,879
No.

342
00:24:08,011 --> 00:24:10,182
No, no, no. No!

343
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:13,085
No!

344
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:16,320
No, no, no!

345
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:19,457
Yes! Bite it! Bite it off!

346
00:24:33,372 --> 00:24:35,908
Wait. Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

347
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,675
Where are you going?

348
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:50,054
Whoa!

349
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:52,124
Whoa, that was so cool.

350
00:24:57,061 --> 00:24:58,296
Nice place.

351
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,400
Can I sit?

352
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:06,437
Thanks.

353
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:12,876
You all alone?

354
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:14,778
Yeah.

355
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,280
Me too.

356
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:24,356
Boy?

357
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:27,726
Is that your name?
Boy? Your name is Boy.

358
00:25:29,093 --> 00:25:30,429
I'm Joel.

359
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:33,065
Nice to meet ya.

360
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:37,702
Thanks, uh...
Thanks for saving my life, Boy.

361
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:47,211
Is this a dress?

362
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:50,114
Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Sorry.

363
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:52,451
Okay, I won't touch it again.

364
00:25:54,751 --> 00:25:57,387
Was that your owner's?

365
00:25:57,521 --> 00:26:00,091
It's okay.
You don't have to talk about it.

366
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:02,793
Sorry.

367
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:05,831
Wait. Did you think I was her?

368
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:07,632
Huh.

369
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:10,502
I'm gonna lie down too.
Is that o...

370
00:26:11,568 --> 00:26:14,673
No, it's okay.
Just my backpack.

371
00:26:24,682 --> 00:26:26,918
You know,
I had a girl, too, once.

372
00:26:27,051 --> 00:26:30,020
Think you would've really liked her.
Yeah, you guys would totally get along.

373
00:26:30,153 --> 00:26:33,825
She loves dogs. I mean, all animals.
She's a big animal lover.

374
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:36,862
I haven't seen her
in seven years.

375
00:26:36,994 --> 00:26:40,298
Long time. That's why
I'm trying to go find her.

376
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:44,870
I haven't told anyone this,
but I'm kinda nervous about it.

377
00:26:53,911 --> 00:26:55,647
Good night, Boy.

378
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:15,901
Weakness: dogs.

379
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,439
That's you.

380
00:27:20,571 --> 00:27:24,107
You wouldn't happen to have a power
source to a ham radio in here, would you?

381
00:27:24,241 --> 00:27:25,844
'Cause I have a...

382
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,545
Never mind.

383
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:38,456
Huh. Lipstick.

384
00:27:38,589 --> 00:27:39,691
Aimee.

385
00:27:40,491 --> 00:27:42,626
Hey, would you mind
if I kept this?

386
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,795
Thanks.

387
00:27:44,395 --> 00:27:47,097
All right, well... this is it.

388
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:49,166
Thanks for having me.

389
00:27:49,299 --> 00:27:52,903
I should...
stop talking to a dog.

390
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:56,807
Okay. I'll see ya.

391
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:08,753
Okay.

392
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:13,658
Oh.

393
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:16,127
Oh, hey, hey, hey.
No, no, no. None of that.

394
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,329
Something might hear you.

395
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:20,865
You wanna come with me?

396
00:28:21,532 --> 00:28:23,634
Okay. You can come.

397
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:25,804
Let's go. Come on.

398
00:28:26,904 --> 00:28:28,472
Uh... What...

399
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:34,778
Yeah, we can bring that.
You want me to put it in my bag?

400
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,150
Okay. It's okay.
I'm gonna keep it safe. I promise.

401
00:28:42,019 --> 00:28:44,256
Going in the safe backpack.

402
00:28:45,088 --> 00:28:46,191
See?

403
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:47,859
Okay, you ready?

404
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,128
Let's go. Come on.

405
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:53,831
Okay, that's really
gonna have to stop.

406
00:28:57,499 --> 00:28:58,971
Feels good, actually,
having company.

407
00:29:17,788 --> 00:29:19,624
<i>Dear Aimee, Guess what.</i>

408
00:29:19,757 --> 00:29:22,794
<i>I got a dog, and he's the coolest.
His name is Boy.</i>

409
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:24,629
<i>He saved my life
from a giant frog in a pool</i>

410
00:29:24,761 --> 00:29:26,764
<i>who tried to eat me
with his tongue.</i>

411
00:29:26,897 --> 00:29:29,699
<i>And then we hung out on his bus.
Man, do we make a great team.</i>

412
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:32,903
<i>We found out we have
a ton in common too.</i>

413
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:35,105
<i>I feel like
we can talk about anything.</i>

414
00:29:36,273 --> 00:29:39,209
<i>You gotta see us out here.
We're like this iconic duo.</i>

415
00:29:39,343 --> 00:29:42,980
<i>I don't know. Feels like when
we're together, we're unstoppable.</i>

416
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:46,084
Hey. What are you doing?
What you got in there?

417
00:29:47,618 --> 00:29:49,319
Oh, my gosh. Yeah. Go. Go!

418
00:29:49,452 --> 00:29:51,455
We gotta go! Come on!

419
00:29:58,362 --> 00:30:01,333
Berries.

420
00:30:01,465 --> 00:30:04,269
Sustenance. Perfect.

421
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:05,769
Ow. Ow!

422
00:30:05,903 --> 00:30:09,441
Ow! What... What are you doing?

423
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,176
Uh...

424
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:15,547
But they look so good.

425
00:30:19,183 --> 00:30:21,720
Yeah, you know what?
I don't think I should eat these.

426
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:25,256
<i>It's crazy the things you forget
about the world. Like the smells.</i>

427
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,425
<i>The grass,
the trees, the flowers.</i>

428
00:30:27,557 --> 00:30:29,661
<i>Sure, you get the occasional
bloody corpse, but...</i>

429
00:30:29,795 --> 00:30:30,829
Aaah!

430
00:30:51,348 --> 00:30:53,617
Oh, no.
I fell in a hole.

431
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:55,854
Okay, I just gotta...

432
00:30:57,154 --> 00:30:58,455
climb out.

433
00:30:58,588 --> 00:31:00,424
I can climb out.

434
00:31:10,499 --> 00:31:11,036
Oh, no.

435
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:13,872
This is bad.

436
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,275
Oh, this is so bad.

437
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:19,511
Stop. Stop it. Shh. Stop it.

438
00:32:09,426 --> 00:32:11,428
It's a rope, you numbskull!

439
00:32:11,563 --> 00:32:14,099
Put it around your foot
and grab on!

440
00:32:14,231 --> 00:32:16,634
Okay, come on! Hold on!

441
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,170
Pull up!

442
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:30,782
You wanna look at 'em? Oh, shit!

443
00:32:32,616 --> 00:32:34,920
Uh...

444
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:37,221
Minnow, finish 'em off.

445
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:41,859
One, two, three, four and...

446
00:32:45,262 --> 00:32:47,531
Are we...

447
00:32:48,932 --> 00:32:50,769
Always count to five.

448
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:52,670
Was that a samurai sword?

449
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,672
Why'd you fall
into a Sandgobbler's nest?

450
00:32:54,805 --> 00:32:57,741
I didn't mean to, you know.
I was just... I was walking.

451
00:32:57,875 --> 00:33:00,110
- What's your name?
- Joel.

452
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:01,512
Joel Dawson.

453
00:33:01,645 --> 00:33:03,280
I'm, uh, Clyde.
This is Minnow.

454
00:33:03,413 --> 00:33:06,283
You're lucky we weren't monsters.
You were yelling like a girl.

455
00:33:06,416 --> 00:33:08,485
"This is bad! This is so bad!"

456
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:12,556
Okay, I don't sound like that.
My voice is not that high-pitched.

457
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:14,558
- Yeah, it is.
- Yes, it is.

458
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:16,861
It was higher than mine,
and I'm eight.

459
00:33:16,993 --> 00:33:20,531
What in God's name are you
doing up here alone anyway?

460
00:33:20,664 --> 00:33:22,766
I'm not alone. I've got Boy too.

461
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,802
Oh, wait, no! No, wait, wait!

462
00:33:24,935 --> 00:33:27,672
Oh, my God, it's a puppy!

463
00:33:27,806 --> 00:33:29,841
Come here, Boy!
Come here, Boy!

464
00:33:29,973 --> 00:33:32,876
- They almost killed my dog.
- Hi, Boy!

465
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,913
Hi!

466
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:36,581
Hey.

467
00:33:36,713 --> 00:33:39,582
So, uh, what happened
with your colony, man?

468
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:41,185
They kick you out?

469
00:33:41,318 --> 00:33:43,320
No, I actually left on my own.

470
00:33:43,453 --> 00:33:46,190
- Something I had to do.
- You stole food, didn't you?

471
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:47,792
- He's a food stealer.
- Yeah.

472
00:33:47,924 --> 00:33:51,361
- No, I didn't steal any food.
- Right.

473
00:33:51,494 --> 00:33:54,064
Me and my colony were really close.
Like family. Okay?

474
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,201
They were super upset
that I left.

475
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:02,640
- Time to go, Minnow.
- Time to go? Why?

476
00:34:02,773 --> 00:34:04,875
So, what...

477
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:07,144
What, uh... What was that?
What's going on?

478
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:10,648
- Could've been a lot of things.
- Tree Flamer. Herd Stomper.

479
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,215
Rockdiver.

480
00:34:12,349 --> 00:34:16,253
Limbsnapper. Limbcrusher.
And my favorite... the Chumbler.

481
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:19,590
Okay, I get it.
A lot of... A lot of names.

482
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:23,327
Whatever it is,
it took your screams for the dinner bell.

483
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,596
If it's got your scent,
it's gonna be on you for a while.

484
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:30,335
Hey, maybe I could, like,
I don't know, come with you guys.

485
00:34:35,172 --> 00:34:37,041
Which way you headed?

486
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,410
Going west.

487
00:34:39,543 --> 00:34:41,978
To the coast. Jenner Beach.

488
00:34:42,112 --> 00:34:44,380
Yeah. We're not
cutting north just yet.

489
00:34:44,514 --> 00:34:47,817
- Not cu... Not cutting north just yet.
- Come on. Come on.

490
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:49,987
Yeah. Whatever you want.

491
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:52,222
You guys want me
to come, I'll come.

492
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:54,224
Come on.

493
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:16,847
That's a good, uh...
good little workout.

494
00:35:18,548 --> 00:35:20,585
A girl, huh?

495
00:35:20,717 --> 00:35:22,286
Yeah.

496
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,855
You left a nice, safe colony to
travel all the way to the ocean

497
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:28,393
for a girl you ain't seen
since you were, what, 17?

498
00:35:28,525 --> 00:35:31,862
No, I know what you're thinking.
I know how it sounds. It's crazy.

499
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:33,530
But... I don't know.

500
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:36,534
If you knew our connection,
you'd probably feel differently.

501
00:35:36,666 --> 00:35:39,503
We actually just got back in touch
over the radio a few weeks ago.

502
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:42,740
And it's still there.
It's just magical. And so sweet.

503
00:35:42,873 --> 00:35:46,109
She loves me too, so a "pick up right
where we left off" kind of thing.

504
00:35:46,242 --> 00:35:49,413
- It's still there.
- You ever hear the term "fool's errand"?

505
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:52,884
All right, what, so I'm a fool
because I believe in true love?

506
00:35:53,016 --> 00:35:55,285
No, you're a fool
because you're out here alone,

507
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,856
you don't know a thing
about survival...

508
00:35:59,356 --> 00:36:00,291
Wind.

509
00:36:00,423 --> 00:36:02,126
...you shoot for shit,

510
00:36:02,259 --> 00:36:06,730
yet you got an attitude like
you're some kind of noble warrior

511
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:09,099
floating on the wings of love.

512
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:12,502
- Doesn't work like that.
- Okay.

513
00:36:12,635 --> 00:36:15,105
Super encouraging speech.

514
00:36:22,512 --> 00:36:23,847
- Damn it.
- You're braining out.

515
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:26,918
- Huh?
- Braining out. Thinking too much.

516
00:36:27,052 --> 00:36:30,355
I always clear my mind
and say to myself,

517
00:36:30,487 --> 00:36:31,623
"a needle through water."

518
00:36:31,755 --> 00:36:33,257
"A needle through water"?

519
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:36,494
Trust me. My dad was the
best archer in my colony.

520
00:36:36,628 --> 00:36:40,864
Oh, really? Okay. Then how come he's
not the one giving me the lessons?

521
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:42,499
'Cause I'm not her dad.

522
00:36:42,632 --> 00:36:44,601
Yeah, my dad got killed.

523
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:46,871
Back when we lived
in the subway station.

524
00:36:47,005 --> 00:36:48,539
Along with Elliot.

525
00:36:48,672 --> 00:36:50,440
Uh, wh-who's Elliot?

526
00:36:50,574 --> 00:36:51,909
My son.

527
00:36:52,876 --> 00:36:55,847
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No need to be sorry.

528
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:59,317
We all have stories like that.
Don't we?

529
00:37:05,956 --> 00:37:07,358
Needle through water.

530
00:37:08,858 --> 00:37:10,894
Needle through water.

531
00:37:14,731 --> 00:37:16,733
Hey, that was pretty close.

532
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:19,203
- It was better.
- It was really good, right?

533
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:21,638
Right?

534
00:37:21,771 --> 00:37:25,543
Tell you what, kid. You gonna hang with
us, you need to know stuff.

535
00:37:25,677 --> 00:37:26,778
Yeah. Okay.

536
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,945
- First lesson.
- Yeah. Hit me.

537
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:31,481
Always survey from high ground
when possible.

538
00:37:31,614 --> 00:37:32,750
- Always.
- Always.

539
00:37:32,884 --> 00:37:34,318
Helps you spot the big ones
in advance.

540
00:37:34,451 --> 00:37:36,320
It's nice to know that thing's
not following us anymore.

541
00:37:36,452 --> 00:37:39,757
No, no, it's definitely still
following us. Just saw it.

542
00:37:39,889 --> 00:37:41,424
- What...
- Yeah.

543
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:43,995
- Chumbler.
- I knew it.

544
00:37:44,128 --> 00:37:47,097
- Big son of a bitch too.
- Big sumanabitch.

545
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:49,133
Got your scent too, man.

546
00:37:49,266 --> 00:37:52,536
- It's gonna be hard to shake.
- Then why are we still standing here?

547
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:55,005
Relax.
Chumblers aren't fast.

548
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:56,907
- We gotta keep moving.
- Mmm.

549
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:59,010
Should've already been gone.

550
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:03,414
- It's got my scent.
- Oh, yeah, it does.

551
00:38:12,889 --> 00:38:14,792
- Comin'?
- Yeah!

552
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:18,663
- Where you guys headed anyway?
- North.

553
00:38:18,795 --> 00:38:20,964
- To the mountains.
- What's up there?

554
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:23,534
A, uh, place called
Snow Mountain Wilderness.

555
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:26,938
Supposed to be some kind of
colony up there full of survivors.

556
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:29,839
The cold and elevation
help to keep the monsters away.

557
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,109
You should definitely
come with us.

558
00:38:32,242 --> 00:38:33,878
Well, I would, but, you know...

559
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:35,945
You gotta go
find your girlfriend.

560
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,582
- Yeah, yeah.
- Uh...

561
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,085
Minnow.

562
00:38:43,052 --> 00:38:44,721
If you knew her,
you'd really like her.

563
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:45,990
She's a super cool person.

564
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:47,557
Well, she's not gonna like you,

565
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:50,527
'cause you can't even get out
of a Sandgobbler's nest.

566
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:53,930
And honestly, I just like you
'cause you have a really cute dog.

567
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:57,568
- Hurts my feelings.
- You're so useless.

568
00:38:59,302 --> 00:39:01,873
It just means
she likes you, man.

569
00:39:02,005 --> 00:39:04,474
She's, uh...
She's been through a lot.

570
00:39:06,476 --> 00:39:07,443
Yeah.

571
00:39:07,577 --> 00:39:09,614
So annoying.

572
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:12,884
- Joel.
- What?

573
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:15,085
Don't move.

574
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:17,355
- Oh, my God. Why?
- Give me your shirt.

575
00:39:17,487 --> 00:39:19,422
My shirt? What do you mean?

576
00:39:19,556 --> 00:39:22,259
Your shirt, man.
Give me your shirt.

577
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:24,795
- Okay.
- Get... Hurr... Come on.

578
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:27,731
- Do what he says, Joel.
- Give me your shirt.

579
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:29,599
Shut up. I'm trying.

580
00:39:29,733 --> 00:39:31,402
Easy. Take it easy.

581
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:34,271
- That's it. That's it.
- Is it a Chumbler?

582
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:36,473
- No.
- What is it called?

583
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:39,677
Take it easy. Lean over, man.

584
00:39:39,811 --> 00:39:41,245
- If I don't make it...
- Shh, shh.

585
00:39:41,378 --> 00:39:44,048
That's it. That's it.

586
00:39:46,182 --> 00:39:47,617
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

587
00:39:47,751 --> 00:39:50,421
Just stay very still.

588
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:53,958
- Okay.
- Shh.

589
00:39:54,791 --> 00:39:56,259
Okay, buddy.

590
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:02,099
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Easy does it.

591
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,135
It's okay.

592
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:07,805
You're okay.

593
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:11,309
It's okay.
You're all right.

594
00:40:12,108 --> 00:40:14,478
All right. Okay, now.

595
00:40:15,211 --> 00:40:18,349
On your way.

596
00:40:18,782 --> 00:40:20,050
Okay, now.

597
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:24,888
All good. On your way now.

598
00:40:25,021 --> 00:40:26,356
On your way.

599
00:40:28,291 --> 00:40:30,627
Good boy. Good boy.

600
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:40,805
What you so scared for?
Boulder Snails are nice.

601
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:42,840
There can be nice ones?

602
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:46,276
You can always tell in their eyes.
Just look at their eyes.

603
00:40:46,409 --> 00:40:49,346
- This one probably saved our lives too.
- Saved our...

604
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,516
Gonna spread your scent
all over this hillside.

605
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:56,387
Shoot. That old Chumbler ain't
gonna know which way to go.

606
00:40:56,521 --> 00:40:58,722
So the Chumbler's
gonna follow my shirt?

607
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:01,291
Thank you, Mr. Boulder Snail.

608
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:04,429
- Thank you, Mr. Boulder Snail!
- Thank you.

609
00:41:04,561 --> 00:41:07,063
Yeah, they're
very sensitive, you know.

610
00:41:08,264 --> 00:41:10,734
But they'll crush your ass...

611
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:13,471
in a second.

612
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:21,278
What you working on, man?

613
00:41:21,411 --> 00:41:25,681
Just a little project I started
a while back in my colony.

614
00:41:25,815 --> 00:41:30,453
Every time we encountered a new
monster, I'd just make a little entry.

615
00:41:30,586 --> 00:41:31,822
Mm-hmm.

616
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:34,726
A drawing.
Um, just some info about it.

617
00:41:34,858 --> 00:41:37,293
You know, strengths, weaknesses.
Stuff like that.

618
00:41:37,427 --> 00:41:39,896
Made me feel like
I was helping out, you know.

619
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:43,065
- You're a pretty good artist.
- Thanks.

620
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:45,935
- I seen this one. Ugly bastard.
- Yeah.

621
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,638
- Doesn't like loud noises.
- Oh, yeah.

622
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:50,875
Also doesn't like
shotgun blasts to the head.

623
00:41:51,007 --> 00:41:52,708
Might wanna add that.

624
00:41:53,242 --> 00:41:55,278
Shotgun to the face.

625
00:41:55,411 --> 00:41:56,779
- Yeah. Got it.
- Oh.

626
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:58,849
- Do you mind if I...
- Oh, sure.

627
00:41:58,981 --> 00:42:01,150
Yeah. Oh, thanks. Thanks.

628
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:03,887
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

629
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:05,923
I was 16 when it hit.

630
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:08,525
Yeah, they sent everything
up at once to take her down.

631
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:11,195
They had the balls
to call us the lucky ones

632
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:14,664
just 'cause whatever the hell was
in those things didn't affect us.

633
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:19,070
Ain't nothing lucky about getting
kicked off the top of the food chain.

634
00:42:19,202 --> 00:42:23,541
Yeah, my parents thought if we
could just make it out of Fairfield,

635
00:42:23,673 --> 00:42:25,007
we might have a shot.

636
00:42:25,141 --> 00:42:26,710
Wait, wait, wait.

637
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:29,980
You're from Fairfield?

638
00:42:30,112 --> 00:42:32,215
Yeah. Why?

639
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:37,019
Man, I've never met anyone
who made it out of Fairfield.

640
00:42:37,153 --> 00:42:40,090
That place
was basically ground zero.

641
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:43,661
Shit, I've only heard
horror stories.

642
00:42:45,228 --> 00:42:46,864
Yeah,
it was pretty bad.

643
00:42:46,996 --> 00:42:48,699
Your parents, uh...

644
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:50,601
Oh, uh, no.

645
00:42:50,733 --> 00:42:53,804
No, it's just me.

646
00:42:56,641 --> 00:42:58,342
Couldn't save 'em.

647
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:01,112
You putting that on yourself?

648
00:43:01,577 --> 00:43:03,413
Mmm.

649
00:43:04,447 --> 00:43:06,250
You're from Fairfield, man.

650
00:43:06,382 --> 00:43:08,585
You shouldn't even be here.
Right?

651
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:11,722
You're more of a survivor
than I thought.

652
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:17,594
That's the coolest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

653
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:20,097
It's a good start.

654
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:24,635
Keep it up. Book like this could
save someone's life out here.

655
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:27,070
Thanks, Clyde.

656
00:43:28,905 --> 00:43:30,240
You, um...

657
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,144
sure your girl's worth it?

658
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:35,413
Coming all this way?

659
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:39,416
Yeah.

660
00:43:39,916 --> 00:43:41,152
Yeah, she is.

661
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,788
Don't settle, Joel.

662
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:47,291
She's right.

663
00:43:47,425 --> 00:43:49,327
You don't have to.

664
00:43:50,293 --> 00:43:52,697
Not even at
the end of the world.

665
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:07,777
Okay! Time to break camp! Let's go!

666
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:09,713
Uh, wh...

667
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:11,214
Lesson two.

668
00:44:11,347 --> 00:44:14,284
You get a hot meal
or a good night's sleep.

669
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:16,787
- Not both.
- Not both.

670
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,755
Are you being serious?

671
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:21,057
Something will have smelled our food and
be all over this camp within the hour.

672
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:25,194
Why wouldn't you tell me that, though?
Uh, I didn't... I didn't do either.

673
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:28,231
I can't tell you everything,
man. Keep up.

674
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:43,113
"Roar! I'm gonna kill you, Joel Dawson!
I'm gonna eat you like broccoli!"

675
00:44:45,382 --> 00:44:47,083
"I'm Joel,
and I can't protect my girlfriend

676
00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:50,519
because I'm useless and insecure
and an awkward little teenager."

677
00:44:50,653 --> 00:44:52,789
"But I need you to save me!
I thought you loved me."

678
00:44:52,922 --> 00:44:56,459
"But I can't because..."

679
00:44:56,592 --> 00:44:58,628
- What?
- That's your girlfriend dying.

680
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:00,998
- What?
- A needle through water.

681
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:04,768
A needle through water.
Needle through water.

682
00:45:06,536 --> 00:45:10,207
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Yes! See? Bull's-eye!

683
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,476
Oh.

684
00:45:12,608 --> 00:45:14,376
Got yourself
an admirer there, huh?

685
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:16,614
Hey, we gotta get going.

686
00:45:16,746 --> 00:45:18,280
Uh, okay.

687
00:45:18,414 --> 00:45:20,650
Come on. Come on.
We gotta go. We...

688
00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:23,988
Minnow? What are you doing?

689
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:27,691
<i>Dear Aimee,
I made friends.</i>

690
00:45:27,824 --> 00:45:28,992
<i>Human friends.</i>

691
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:30,861
<i>And they're teaching me
everything they know.</i>

692
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:35,432
<i>Like lesson three:
Don't take shortcuts.</i>

693
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:41,038
<i>Lesson eight:
Target practice every day.</i>

694
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:42,739
<i>I'm getting pretty good
with my crossbow.</i>

695
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:44,740
- See?
- Pretty good.

696
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:48,746
<i>Lesson ten: Keep your socks dry.
That's a great one.</i>

697
00:45:49,847 --> 00:45:52,550
<i>I'm kinda struggling
with lesson two: Not both.</i>

698
00:45:52,682 --> 00:45:54,385
<i>That one is not great.</i>

699
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:57,320
Not both. Not both.

700
00:45:57,454 --> 00:45:59,923
Come on, Joel. Not both.

701
00:46:00,056 --> 00:46:01,891
<i>I'm super tired.</i>

702
00:46:10,233 --> 00:46:13,671
All right, a lot of things out
here you shouldn't touch or eat,

703
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:17,340
but, uh, ferns like these
have an antivenom.

704
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:20,678
Good in a pinch
for snakes, slugs.

705
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:23,247
- Great entry for your book.
- Yep, got it.

706
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:27,284
The insect-looking ones
got no peripheral vision.

707
00:46:27,416 --> 00:46:28,652
No peripheral... Ah!

708
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:31,288
The lizard-looking ones
can't climb for shit.

709
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:34,958
The amphibian-looking ones like to
hide, lure ya in, eat ya whole.

710
00:46:35,092 --> 00:46:37,360
Then there are the Sandgobblers.

711
00:46:37,494 --> 00:46:39,129
Those guys are badasses.

712
00:46:39,262 --> 00:46:41,164
Badasses!

713
00:46:41,297 --> 00:46:43,132
Yeah, I know.
I fell into their hole.

714
00:46:43,266 --> 00:46:44,902
What you saw were worker bees.

715
00:46:45,034 --> 00:46:48,605
What you wanna avoid under
all circumstances is a queen.

716
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:50,407
How do I know if it's a queen?

717
00:46:50,539 --> 00:46:54,478
Well, your first clue would be a
giant fin slicing through the earth,

718
00:46:54,612 --> 00:46:57,782
following every single sound
and vibration you make.

719
00:46:57,914 --> 00:46:59,817
You howling in pain...

720
00:46:59,949 --> 00:47:02,952
...as you're being ripped
in half will be your second.

721
00:47:03,086 --> 00:47:05,855
Copy. I'll keep that in mind.

722
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:09,492
Well, we're getting
close to where our paths diverge.

723
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:13,097
You're gonna wanna go west
to Jenner, the beaches.

724
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:16,867
Or you can be sensible,
come with us to the mountains.

725
00:47:17,833 --> 00:47:21,270
Yeah, um, I think I've been
sensible all my life,

726
00:47:21,403 --> 00:47:23,007
and it's really
gotten me nowhere.

727
00:47:23,139 --> 00:47:25,708
Come with us.
Strength in numbers, you know?

728
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:28,579
Besides,
think we'd make a good team.

729
00:47:28,711 --> 00:47:30,914
No, I think so, too.
I just, uh...

730
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:33,050
It's just something I gotta do.

731
00:47:33,182 --> 00:47:35,152
It's not fair.

732
00:47:35,284 --> 00:47:37,887
Wh... Hey. Wha...

733
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:41,291
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa. What's going on?

734
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:43,394
Why do you gotta go?

735
00:47:45,161 --> 00:47:48,331
'Cause this girl, she means a lot to me.
You know?

736
00:47:48,465 --> 00:47:52,436
Come on. You know I gotta do this.
We talked about this.

737
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:56,139
Hey, you know what?
I got something for ya.

738
00:47:56,273 --> 00:47:58,675
I don't even know if you'd know
what this is, but...

739
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:00,110
Lipstick?

740
00:48:00,242 --> 00:48:01,277
Oh.

741
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:03,212
- What?
- Yeah.

742
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:05,615
Yeah, it's lip...

743
00:48:05,748 --> 00:48:07,050
Aw.

744
00:48:08,784 --> 00:48:11,153
I take back
what I said before.

745
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:12,923
Aimee's gonna love you.

746
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:16,592
Thanks, Minnow.
You got some snot.

747
00:48:16,726 --> 00:48:19,129
Yeah.

748
00:48:19,996 --> 00:48:22,565
All right. Come on.

749
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:30,007
Final lesson.

750
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:33,343
Listen to your instincts
out here.

751
00:48:33,476 --> 00:48:34,944
They'll keep you alive.

752
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:38,749
Yeah. What if I have,
uh, terrible instincts?

753
00:48:38,882 --> 00:48:39,916
You'll die.

754
00:48:40,449 --> 00:48:41,884
Y...

755
00:48:42,018 --> 00:48:46,121
Listen, man, good instincts
are earned by making mistakes.

756
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,292
If you're lucky enough
to survive a few mistakes,

757
00:48:49,425 --> 00:48:51,661
you're gonna be
okay out here.

758
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:55,332
This might come in handy, too.

759
00:48:55,465 --> 00:48:56,833
Wow!

760
00:48:57,701 --> 00:48:58,969
Oh, that's great.
Do you have, uh...

761
00:48:59,101 --> 00:49:00,836
Do you have any more
that I could have?

762
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:02,005
You get one.

763
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:06,242
Pull the pin, count to five.
Not four, not six.

764
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:07,976
Five.

765
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:09,480
Got it.

766
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:14,151
You're gonna be okay.

767
00:49:15,985 --> 00:49:16,953
Minnow?

768
00:49:17,086 --> 00:49:18,521
Let's go, kid.

769
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:24,928
Hey, man, you made it
all this way from Fairfield.

770
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:28,199
What's another 30 miles, huh?

771
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:40,242
Uh-oh, here he comes.

772
00:49:40,376 --> 00:49:42,112
Hi.

773
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:45,816
Hey there.

774
00:49:58,762 --> 00:50:00,864
I know.
I'm gonna miss 'em, too.

775
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:03,465
It's a good decision,
though. It's good.

776
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:05,835
You feel good about it,
right?

777
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:10,173
Come on, Boy.

778
00:50:45,775 --> 00:50:48,144
Aw, I'm okay.
I'm just gonna...

779
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:50,781
You can have that.

780
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:53,549
I'll just stick
to the beans.

781
00:50:53,682 --> 00:50:54,818
I'm good.

782
00:50:54,952 --> 00:50:57,254
I'm not gonna eat that,
so...

783
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:16,272
Hey, come on.
We gotta keep moving.

784
00:51:16,405 --> 00:51:19,943
I know. There's a lot
of creepy stuff. Creepy boats.

785
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:22,979
Kind of a creepy sign.

786
00:51:23,112 --> 00:51:26,182
But nothing
we haven't seen before.

787
00:51:26,315 --> 00:51:27,583
Just gotta be brave.

788
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:29,752
What...

789
00:51:31,054 --> 00:51:33,690
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's going on? What's happening?

790
00:51:33,822 --> 00:51:34,891
You okay?

791
00:51:35,025 --> 00:51:37,628
You hearing something, Boy?

792
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,130
Boy, Boy, Boy! Boy!

793
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:45,300
Hey! Boy! Boy! Boy!

794
00:51:45,434 --> 00:51:46,969
Boy! Are you okay?

795
00:51:47,103 --> 00:51:49,173
I need some kind
of communication here.

796
00:51:51,407 --> 00:51:54,143
Oh. I hear it.

797
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:06,489
We gotta go. Hey.

798
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:10,360
We really gotta go.
Please get out from under the duck.

799
00:52:19,603 --> 00:52:21,105
We gotta go.

800
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:21,365
<i>Joel. You okay?</i>

801
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:24,001
You okay?

802
00:53:24,833 --> 00:53:26,602
Joel! Get out of the car!

803
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:28,638
<i>Joel, get outta the car!</i>

804
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:34,077
Run, Joel, run!

805
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:36,145
<i>Run! Go!</i>

806
00:53:40,684 --> 00:53:41,952
<i>You can survive this.</i>

807
00:53:42,085 --> 00:53:45,222
I love you. I love you.

808
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:08,778
No.

809
00:54:12,514 --> 00:54:13,850
Hey!

810
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:34,938
Boy?

811
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:39,143
Are you okay?

812
00:54:42,344 --> 00:54:43,980
Yeah! Yeah, you're okay!
You're okay!

813
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:47,550
You're okay.
You're okay. You're okay.

814
00:54:47,684 --> 00:54:49,319
Aren't you? Aren't you?

815
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:51,154
Ah!

816
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:52,489
Yeah!

817
00:54:53,856 --> 00:54:55,359
We're monster killers.

818
00:54:55,492 --> 00:54:58,528
Whoo-ooh!

819
00:55:04,434 --> 00:55:05,836
Ah!

820
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:12,909
Wow.

821
00:55:13,043 --> 00:55:15,612
You know, I haven't felt
the rain in seven years.

822
00:55:15,746 --> 00:55:18,248
Pretty cool.
Pretty cool.

823
00:55:22,885 --> 00:55:25,121
Hey, Boy,
you think I'm crazy?

824
00:55:26,655 --> 00:55:28,424
Coming all this way?

825
00:55:31,126 --> 00:55:33,163
Hello.

826
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,615
Holy shit.

827
00:55:54,951 --> 00:55:56,686
You're alive.

828
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:59,489
I mean... you're on.

829
00:55:59,621 --> 00:56:04,894
I have 51 minutes of power left.
What is your name?

830
00:56:05,027 --> 00:56:07,596
Uh, I'm Joel.

831
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:10,967
- My name is Joel.
- Hello, Joel.

832
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:13,536
I am so pleased to meet you.

833
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:15,238
My name is Mavis.

834
00:56:15,371 --> 00:56:17,373
But if you were to write it out,

835
00:56:17,507 --> 00:56:20,376
you would write it
with a 1 and not an I.

836
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:22,178
Yeah, I know.

837
00:56:22,311 --> 00:56:26,181
You are familiar with the Mav1s line.
Delightful!

838
00:56:26,315 --> 00:56:28,717
You guys were supposed to be
the next amazing thing.

839
00:56:28,851 --> 00:56:30,554
I can't believe
I'm talkin' to one.

840
00:56:30,686 --> 00:56:32,422
But if you were to write it out,

841
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:35,659
you would write it
with a 1 and not an I.

842
00:56:37,025 --> 00:56:39,194
Yeah. You said that.

843
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:42,164
Years ago, I was bitten in half

844
00:56:42,297 --> 00:56:45,534
by something
I did not get a chance to name.

845
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:48,471
I crawled here for safety
and powered down,

846
00:56:48,605 --> 00:56:51,840
hoping someone
would one day find me.

847
00:56:51,974 --> 00:56:54,309
And here you are!

848
00:56:54,443 --> 00:56:55,277
Amazing.

849
00:56:55,411 --> 00:56:57,847
Joel, besides
conversing with me,

850
00:56:57,980 --> 00:56:59,715
for which
I am eternally grateful,

851
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:03,652
may I ask what you are doing
outside of your colony?

852
00:57:03,786 --> 00:57:04,721
Yeah, um...

853
00:57:04,853 --> 00:57:07,490
Did you steal food?

854
00:57:07,623 --> 00:57:08,857
No.

855
00:57:08,990 --> 00:57:10,525
No, I didn't steal
any food.

856
00:57:10,659 --> 00:57:14,998
Um, I'm actually on a quest...
to find a girl.

857
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:19,067
Why, Joel, a lovely lady
has caught your eye!

858
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:20,436
What is her name?

859
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:24,374
Uh, her name's Aimee.
With one I and two E's.

860
00:57:24,507 --> 00:57:28,545
She sounds like
an incredible person, Joel.

861
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:32,715
Is there anything
I can do to assist you

862
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:36,486
in your quest for Aimee
with one I and two E's?

863
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:41,358
Nope. Appreciate it, Mav1s,
but, uh, unfortunately not.

864
00:57:41,490 --> 00:57:45,329
Unless you happen to have a power
source to an SK-21 ham radio handy.

865
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:48,398
Oh, no, but...

866
00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:51,800
I would be honored to donate
my remaining power to you

867
00:57:51,934 --> 00:57:56,373
if it would help you with your quest
for Aimee with one I and two E's.

868
00:58:01,445 --> 00:58:04,213
She probably thinks
I've been devoured by now.

869
00:58:04,347 --> 00:58:07,017
Oh, this is all so exciting!

870
00:58:09,318 --> 00:58:11,555
- It's working.
- Hooray!

871
00:58:12,688 --> 00:58:15,090
3022? Come in, 3022.

872
00:58:15,224 --> 00:58:17,427
- <i>Joel?</i>
- Aimee! Hey. Hey.

873
00:58:17,559 --> 00:58:19,996
<i>Your colony told me you were
coming here. Are you okay?</i>

874
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:22,599
<i>I was worried.
It's so good to hear your voice.</i>

875
00:58:22,731 --> 00:58:26,168
Yeah, it's good to hear yours, too.
Yeah, I'm alive. I'm good. I'm okay.

876
00:58:26,302 --> 00:58:28,971
<i>I-I-I can't believe
you're actually doing this.</i>

877
00:58:29,105 --> 00:58:32,141
I know. It's crazy. Aimee,
I cannot wait to tell you everything.

878
00:58:32,275 --> 00:58:34,077
I feel like a whole new man,
you know?

879
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:36,512
You should see me out here.
I'm fighting monsters.

880
00:58:36,646 --> 00:58:38,914
I'm in a motel right now
with a robot and a dog.

881
00:58:39,048 --> 00:58:41,250
<i>What? That sounds crazy.</i>

882
00:58:41,384 --> 00:58:43,519
<i>How far are you
from Jenner Beach?</i>

883
00:58:43,652 --> 00:58:47,189
Um, how far? I'm getting close.
I'm, um...

884
00:58:48,157 --> 00:58:49,525
I'm 9.3 miles to you.

885
00:58:49,659 --> 00:58:52,595
<i>Joel, listen.
I have amazing news.</i>

886
00:58:52,728 --> 00:58:55,931
<i>Some survivors showed up a few days
ago, and they're rescuing us.</i>

887
00:58:56,065 --> 00:58:57,399
<i>They're gonna get us
out of here!</i>

888
00:58:57,532 --> 00:58:59,935
<i>They're really helping me
with the colony.</i>

889
00:59:00,068 --> 00:59:02,706
Oh. Okay, g-getting you out
of there? What do you mean?

890
00:59:02,838 --> 00:59:06,342
<i>I can't remember the last time I actually
felt like everything was going to be...</i>

891
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:08,577
Wh... Aimee?

892
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:10,012
Aimee? Aimee?

893
00:59:10,146 --> 00:59:11,248
Shit.

894
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:14,083
My battery
has automatically shut down

895
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:18,755
in order to preserve
my final 15 minutes of power.

896
00:59:18,887 --> 00:59:21,958
- I am very sorry, Joel.
- No, it's okay, Mav1s.

897
00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:24,027
You don't have to...

898
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:27,997
Joel?

899
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:32,033
I haven't been outside
in a very long time.

900
00:59:32,168 --> 00:59:34,403
Yeah. I hadn't, either.

901
00:59:40,376 --> 00:59:43,813
- There you go.
- Is something troubling you, Joel?

902
00:59:43,947 --> 00:59:48,084
You can tell me anything,
as I am an empathetic listener.

903
00:59:48,217 --> 00:59:54,423
Also, my memory banks will be
permanently erased in 14 minutes.

904
00:59:56,259 --> 01:00:00,228
You know that feeling where you just
completely put yourself out there?

905
01:00:00,362 --> 01:00:01,964
You know?
And you're so sure of it.

906
01:00:02,097 --> 01:00:05,902
And... right when you're
about to cross the finish line,

907
01:00:06,036 --> 01:00:10,972
you just think is this the dumbest...
thing I ever could've done?

908
01:00:11,106 --> 01:00:13,742
I don't think it's dumb,
Joel.

909
01:00:13,876 --> 01:00:16,078
I think it's romantic.

910
01:00:16,211 --> 01:00:18,581
Right, see?
Yeah, okay, you get it.

911
01:00:19,548 --> 01:00:21,384
Romantic, that's what...
Yeah.

912
01:00:21,516 --> 01:00:24,686
Do not give up
on your quest, Joel.

913
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:29,125
When you see her, she will
appreciate the grand romantic gesture

914
01:00:29,259 --> 01:00:30,893
implied by your journey

915
01:00:31,025 --> 01:00:34,964
and be moved by your kindness
and leadership qualities.

916
01:00:35,097 --> 01:00:36,333
Thanks, Mav1s.

917
01:00:37,766 --> 01:00:42,103
Another option is that Aimee will
not see those qualities in you

918
01:00:42,237 --> 01:00:44,440
and you will have traveled
a great distance

919
01:00:44,572 --> 01:00:47,409
only to be met
with disappointment.

920
01:00:47,543 --> 01:00:51,647
Perhaps you will have learned
valuable lessons along the way?

921
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:53,649
Okay.

922
01:00:53,782 --> 01:00:57,452
A third option is that you
don't survive the journey at all

923
01:00:57,586 --> 01:00:59,688
and get eaten
by mutated insects...

924
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:01,656
- Okay, that's... I get it.
- ...amphibians...

925
01:01:01,791 --> 01:01:04,126
There are so many ways
you could perish.

926
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:05,227
I get it.

927
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,663
Thanks for the...

928
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:09,532
Thanks for that.

929
01:01:11,367 --> 01:01:13,803
Would you like
to see a trick, Joel?

930
01:01:13,936 --> 01:01:15,337
Sure.

931
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:18,574
What is your full name,
and where were you born?

932
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:21,278
Uh, Joel Dawson.
Fairfield, California.

933
01:01:24,246 --> 01:01:25,681
Whoa.

934
01:01:27,217 --> 01:01:28,251
Whoa.

935
01:01:28,384 --> 01:01:31,320
What lovely parents
you had, Joel.

936
01:01:32,322 --> 01:01:34,191
Oh, my God.

937
01:01:34,824 --> 01:01:35,858
Wow.

938
01:01:36,592 --> 01:01:38,627
I don't even have a picture.

939
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:42,097
What would you say
to your mother now, Joel,

940
01:01:42,231 --> 01:01:44,334
if you had the chance?

941
01:01:50,572 --> 01:01:52,608
I guess I'd tell her I'm okay.

942
01:01:57,346 --> 01:01:59,583
<i>I made it to a colony.</i>

943
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,887
Met a lot of really,
really good people

944
01:02:04,019 --> 01:02:06,590
who took really good care of me.

945
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:16,332
They also lost a lot, so...

946
01:02:19,101 --> 01:02:21,437
And I miss you guys so much.

947
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:27,644
I'm so sorry.

948
01:02:38,487 --> 01:02:41,624
Oh, look! Sky Jellies!

949
01:02:41,757 --> 01:02:45,528
They're harmless
and quite lovely.

950
01:02:46,728 --> 01:02:47,896
Wow.

951
01:02:49,097 --> 01:02:51,934
Oh! <i>Canis familiaris!</i>

952
01:02:52,068 --> 01:02:55,338
You found my foot.
Thank you.

953
01:02:55,472 --> 01:02:58,742
- That's my dog.
- He's delightful.

954
01:03:00,576 --> 01:03:02,579
Yeah, he's a good boy.

955
01:03:03,847 --> 01:03:07,584
Joel, would you like to hear a song?

956
01:03:08,184 --> 01:03:09,686
Yeah, okay.

957
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:38,915
You know, nature's kinda nice

958
01:03:39,048 --> 01:03:41,083
when there's nothing trying
to kill you.

959
01:03:48,692 --> 01:03:49,826
Mav1s?

960
01:03:55,297 --> 01:03:56,765
Thanks.

961
01:04:02,538 --> 01:04:04,974
<i>Some survivors
showed up at the camp.</i>

962
01:04:06,275 --> 01:04:09,044
That's not something I gotta worry
about, you don't think, right?

963
01:04:09,177 --> 01:04:11,914
I mean, what are the odds
that they're, like, awesome

964
01:04:12,047 --> 01:04:16,251
and similar to my age and potentially
a threat to me romantically?

965
01:04:16,385 --> 01:04:18,286
Slim to none, probably.

966
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:21,490
I think it's good, actually.
I think we're totally, uh... fine.

967
01:04:21,623 --> 01:04:24,760
Actually, why don't we pick up the
pace a little bit, just in case...

968
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:27,564
Um...

969
01:04:28,463 --> 01:04:30,333
Okay, you know what?

970
01:04:30,465 --> 01:04:32,469
Why don't we go
another way. Yeah?

971
01:04:33,902 --> 01:04:35,070
Uh...

972
01:04:38,407 --> 01:04:39,342
Boy?

973
01:04:39,474 --> 01:04:40,710
Boy!

974
01:04:42,344 --> 01:04:44,213
Boy, where you going?

975
01:04:55,791 --> 01:04:57,494
Queen.

976
01:05:26,521 --> 01:05:28,123
Run, Boy! Run!

977
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:29,793
Get...

978
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:33,663
Go, go! Go!

979
01:05:39,802 --> 01:05:40,935
Sh...

980
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:46,976
Wait!

981
01:05:47,108 --> 01:05:48,344
Boy!

982
01:05:48,476 --> 01:05:50,913
Boy, I can't run that fast!

983
01:06:06,961 --> 01:06:09,565
Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh.

984
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:32,889
Shh-shh-shh. Shh.

985
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:39,229
Shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh.

986
01:07:08,523 --> 01:07:11,827
Oh, my God. Oh, I'm so sorry.

987
01:07:12,327 --> 01:07:13,695
I'm sorry.

988
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:19,869
What are you doing?

989
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:22,438
Don't you dare.

990
01:07:22,572 --> 01:07:25,208
Whoa, whoa. What are you doing?

991
01:07:27,675 --> 01:07:29,211
No. Wait, Boy!

992
01:07:29,344 --> 01:07:30,679
Boy!

993
01:07:31,648 --> 01:07:33,849
Boy, don't even think about it.

994
01:07:33,983 --> 01:07:35,617
Don't. Don't you do it.

995
01:07:35,751 --> 01:07:37,753
Don't. Don't. No!

996
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:51,968
Count to five.

997
01:07:53,335 --> 01:07:54,704
One, two...

998
01:07:58,940 --> 01:08:01,109
Two. Uh, three, four...

999
01:08:01,244 --> 01:08:02,644
five!

1000
01:08:22,097 --> 01:08:24,065
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

1001
01:08:24,198 --> 01:08:25,701
Yes!

1002
01:08:25,833 --> 01:08:28,171
Yes! Oh, my God!

1003
01:08:29,238 --> 01:08:30,972
Oh, that was awesome.

1004
01:08:31,105 --> 01:08:33,507
I feel like Tom Cruise.

1005
01:08:35,844 --> 01:08:39,213
Oh! Ow.
What the hell is...

1006
01:08:39,347 --> 01:08:40,917
Ow!

1007
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:49,725
Ow!

1008
01:08:52,662 --> 01:08:54,396
Oh, my God.

1009
01:08:55,331 --> 01:08:56,399
Ow! Ow!

1010
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:01,369
Get that dress
out of my face!

1011
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:05,373
Boy?

1012
01:09:15,184 --> 01:09:16,485
Oh!

1013
01:09:22,524 --> 01:09:24,027
Oh, f...

1014
01:09:36,305 --> 01:09:37,271
Okay.

1015
01:09:37,405 --> 01:09:39,007
Oh, no.

1016
01:09:57,259 --> 01:09:59,627
Okay, all right,
I think I'm good.

1017
01:09:59,761 --> 01:10:01,464
I think I got 'em all.

1018
01:10:02,465 --> 01:10:04,333
What?

1019
01:10:06,769 --> 01:10:09,639
God! No!

1020
01:10:13,475 --> 01:10:15,411
You! You! You!

1021
01:10:15,543 --> 01:10:18,547
This is all your fault!
What is wrong with you?

1022
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:21,116
Why don't you listen to me,
huh? Huh?

1023
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:23,418
You have any idea what you just did?
You just almost got us killed!

1024
01:10:23,551 --> 01:10:26,221
We are supposed to care
about each other, okay?

1025
01:10:26,354 --> 01:10:30,058
I would never do that to you, never!
You bailed on me! Oh, my God!

1026
01:10:30,192 --> 01:10:33,228
That freakin' dress!
I can't take it anymore!

1027
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:54,649
<i>Dear Aimee,
It's not looking good.</i>

1028
01:10:54,783 --> 01:10:56,919
<i>And by "it," I don't remember
what I was talking about.</i>

1029
01:10:58,787 --> 01:11:01,157
<i>I can't feel my feet.</i>

1030
01:11:01,289 --> 01:11:02,358
<i>Or my face.</i>

1031
01:11:04,458 --> 01:11:05,594
<i>I think I'm dying.</i>

1032
01:11:16,137 --> 01:11:20,876
<i>I'm gonna kill you, Joel Dawson!
I'm gonna eat you like broccoli!</i>

1033
01:11:22,176 --> 01:11:24,579
<i>Ferns like these
have an antivenom.</i>

1034
01:11:24,712 --> 01:11:28,183
<i>Good in a pinch for snakes, slugs.</i>

1035
01:11:55,511 --> 01:11:58,414
<i>If you find the best dog ever,</i>

1036
01:11:58,546 --> 01:12:00,015
<i>that's Boy.</i>

1037
01:12:00,917 --> 01:12:03,051
<i>Please, look after him.</i>

1038
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:05,154
<i>Tell him I'm sorry.</i>

1039
01:12:05,287 --> 01:12:07,322
- Have you seen my dog?
- <i>Tell him I love him.</i>

1040
01:12:07,456 --> 01:12:09,925
Have you seen him?
I yelled at him.

1041
01:12:10,059 --> 01:12:12,394
<i>And don't take his dress out of his mouth.
He doesn't like that.</i>

1042
01:12:12,528 --> 01:12:14,396
And now I might not
ever see him again.

1043
01:12:14,529 --> 01:12:17,599
<i>And please don't shout at him.
I know you won't.</i>

1044
01:12:20,269 --> 01:12:21,436
Joel.

1045
01:12:22,704 --> 01:12:24,171
Oh, my God.

1046
01:12:24,706 --> 01:12:27,009
- It's you.
- Aimee?

1047
01:12:27,143 --> 01:12:29,478
I can't believe you made it.

1048
01:12:29,610 --> 01:12:32,514
Oh, my God.
I can't believe you made it.

1049
01:12:32,646 --> 01:12:34,382
You made it,
Joel.

1050
01:12:35,016 --> 01:12:37,854
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

1051
01:12:39,921 --> 01:12:41,823
Oh, you're so beautiful.

1052
01:12:57,005 --> 01:12:58,574
That was nice.

1053
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:13,956
Aimee?

1054
01:13:15,992 --> 01:13:16,925
Aimee.

1055
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:18,761
- Aimee.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1056
01:13:18,894 --> 01:13:20,395
T-T-Take it easy.
Take it easy.

1057
01:13:20,529 --> 01:13:23,900
Still pretty messed up from all the poison.
How do you feel?

1058
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,168
I feel... I'm good.

1059
01:13:26,301 --> 01:13:28,469
Good. No, I'm f...
I-I'm okay.

1060
01:13:29,537 --> 01:13:32,673
What was it like? I mean,
you have to tell me everything.

1061
01:13:32,807 --> 01:13:35,877
Honestly, it wasn't that bad. I don't
know what everyone's complaining about.

1062
01:13:36,011 --> 01:13:38,546
- Oh?
- No, it was terrible.

1063
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,581
I almost... died a lot.

1064
01:13:41,984 --> 01:13:44,119
It's so good to see you.

1065
01:13:44,987 --> 01:13:46,788
I'm lucky you found me
when you did.

1066
01:13:46,921 --> 01:13:48,189
About that, um...

1067
01:13:48,323 --> 01:13:50,425
And hey, we... kissed.

1068
01:13:50,559 --> 01:13:53,596
- You were hallucinating pretty hard.
- How amazing was that, huh?

1069
01:13:53,729 --> 01:13:55,564
You kissed Old Pete.

1070
01:13:55,698 --> 01:13:58,401
- Hi, Pete.
- Oh. Yeah.

1071
01:14:00,702 --> 01:14:02,271
That'd be hilarious.

1072
01:14:04,907 --> 01:14:06,409
Oh, yeah,
I really did.

1073
01:14:09,110 --> 01:14:11,680
I don't know how
to move on from this.

1074
01:14:11,814 --> 01:14:13,914
What was that you said
on the radio about, uh...

1075
01:14:14,048 --> 01:14:17,552
Yeah. This yacht captain and his
crew show up out of the blue.

1076
01:14:17,686 --> 01:14:20,288
- Did you say a yacht captain?
- Yeah, yeah.

1077
01:14:20,421 --> 01:14:23,490
And he says he can find us a safe
place to live and a new home.

1078
01:14:23,625 --> 01:14:25,293
I'm trying to pack
everything up right now.

1079
01:14:25,426 --> 01:14:27,128
Why is he called
a yacht captain?

1080
01:14:27,261 --> 01:14:29,130
'Cause he's the captain
of the yacht, you moron.

1081
01:14:29,264 --> 01:14:31,634
Oh, my God.
Be nice, Bill.

1082
01:14:31,766 --> 01:14:33,534
- What?
- I'm trying to listen.

1083
01:14:33,668 --> 01:14:36,706
So anyway, I just wanted to say
something to you, though...

1084
01:14:36,838 --> 01:14:37,773
- Whoo.
- Oh!

1085
01:14:37,905 --> 01:14:39,274
Aimee! Aimee!

1086
01:14:39,408 --> 01:14:41,510
We got another leak
in the main line.

1087
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:44,212
Bastard's spitting freshwater
all over the beach!

1088
01:14:44,345 --> 01:14:47,114
Yeah, yeah, thank you, Janice.
I'll be right there.

1089
01:14:47,248 --> 01:14:48,849
- Oh.
- Hi, Joel.

1090
01:14:48,984 --> 01:14:50,919
Hey, Janice.
Good to meet you.

1091
01:14:51,052 --> 01:14:52,421
- Please...
- Everyone's so old.

1092
01:14:52,554 --> 01:14:55,091
- You came at a crazy time.
- Yeah.

1093
01:14:55,224 --> 01:14:57,226
- Can we put a pin in this?
- Yeah.

1094
01:14:57,359 --> 01:14:59,695
Put a pin in it. Sure.

1095
01:15:17,078 --> 01:15:18,514
Hey, man.

1096
01:15:35,363 --> 01:15:37,432
It's all falling apart, Aimee.

1097
01:15:37,565 --> 01:15:40,935
I don't know what's happening here.
What can we do?

1098
01:15:41,069 --> 01:15:44,139
Yeah, I know, Janice.
I'm sorry.

1099
01:15:44,273 --> 01:15:46,908
Janice, will you just...
Will you give me the wrench?

1100
01:15:47,775 --> 01:15:49,778
This is a shitshow.

1101
01:15:49,911 --> 01:15:53,282
Who left the kelp out in the sun?
That was meant to be packed up already.

1102
01:15:53,414 --> 01:15:55,617
- It's gonna bring in the flies.
- It's swellin' up.

1103
01:15:55,751 --> 01:15:59,288
Yeah, I don't think feet
are meant to be that color.

1104
01:16:01,021 --> 01:16:01,957
Hey.

1105
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:03,324
Perfect timing.

1106
01:16:03,458 --> 01:16:06,394
Guys! Joel,
this is Dana and Rocko.

1107
01:16:06,528 --> 01:16:09,030
- What's up?
- These are the guys from the yacht.

1108
01:16:09,163 --> 01:16:10,465
Cool. Oh.

1109
01:16:10,597 --> 01:16:13,001
Is that a...
Is that an arm cannon?

1110
01:16:13,134 --> 01:16:14,536
Homemade.

1111
01:16:14,668 --> 01:16:17,271
So which one...
which one of you is the yacht captain?

1112
01:16:17,404 --> 01:16:20,007
Guilty as charged.
Captain Brooks Wilkinson.

1113
01:16:20,141 --> 01:16:22,210
- Royal Australian Navy.
- Oh, dear God.

1114
01:16:22,344 --> 01:16:25,146
Retired, of course.
My mates call me Cap.

1115
01:16:25,279 --> 01:16:26,282
How you doing, man?

1116
01:16:26,414 --> 01:16:27,582
I see you've met
these specimens,

1117
01:16:27,716 --> 01:16:30,018
but this beautiful lady,
that's our yacht.

1118
01:16:31,019 --> 01:16:33,889
A little showy for my taste,
but she gets the job done.

1119
01:16:34,021 --> 01:16:35,823
- Huh.
- Cap, this is Joel.

1120
01:16:35,957 --> 01:16:37,525
Joel. Right.

1121
01:16:37,658 --> 01:16:40,094
Joel ended up traveling seven
days on the surface to get here.

1122
01:16:40,228 --> 01:16:42,297
- Seven days?
- Seven... Yeah, seven days.

1123
01:16:42,430 --> 01:16:44,899
- That is one hell of a journey, Joel.
- It was. Yeah.

1124
01:16:45,033 --> 01:16:47,068
I don't get it.
Why'd you leave your colony, Joel?

1125
01:16:47,202 --> 01:16:48,804
You get caught stealing food?

1126
01:16:48,938 --> 01:16:52,606
No, I didn't get caught stealing food.
Why is that such a thing?

1127
01:16:52,740 --> 01:16:54,475
He came for love.

1128
01:16:54,609 --> 01:16:56,143
Good on ya, mate.
That's beautiful.

1129
01:16:56,278 --> 01:16:59,048
There is no mission
more admirable than love.

1130
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:01,482
Every sailor
worth his salt knows that.

1131
01:17:01,615 --> 01:17:03,551
Yo, Cap.
We cooking this shit or what?

1132
01:17:03,685 --> 01:17:05,987
Feel like I got King Kong's nuts
on my shoulders, man.

1133
01:17:06,121 --> 01:17:08,090
That's charming, Rock,
really.

1134
01:17:08,222 --> 01:17:11,460
Joel, you look like a man who
knows his way around a barbecue.

1135
01:17:11,592 --> 01:17:14,262
- I... don't...
- Come help us get a fire started.

1136
01:17:14,395 --> 01:17:16,764
Um, actually, I'm gonna...

1137
01:17:16,898 --> 01:17:20,034
- catch up with Aimee for a sec, if it's...
- Yeah.

1138
01:17:20,167 --> 01:17:22,436
I apologize.
I... Old habits.

1139
01:17:22,570 --> 01:17:26,007
You show up and...
here I am trying to give you orders.

1140
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:27,475
I'll give you guys
some privacy, yeah?

1141
01:17:27,609 --> 01:17:29,411
- Thank you.
- Yeah, <i>namaste.</i>

1142
01:17:29,545 --> 01:17:31,212
Uh, I was gonna just,
if you...

1143
01:17:31,345 --> 01:17:32,647
- Hey, Joel.
- Yeah?

1144
01:17:32,780 --> 01:17:34,716
We're throwing a killer
going-away party tonight.

1145
01:17:34,849 --> 01:17:36,083
Nothing fancy, but...

1146
01:17:36,217 --> 01:17:38,653
we'll have a drink together
to welcome you to the colony.

1147
01:17:38,787 --> 01:17:39,722
Okay.

1148
01:17:39,854 --> 01:17:41,054
First beer's on me.

1149
01:17:41,189 --> 01:17:42,591
Thanks.

1150
01:17:42,724 --> 01:17:44,259
He's nice.

1151
01:17:44,391 --> 01:17:45,693
Brews his own beer.

1152
01:17:45,828 --> 01:17:48,130
- Oh.
- Hello, darling. How are you?

1153
01:17:48,262 --> 01:17:50,265
Course he does.

1154
01:17:53,135 --> 01:17:55,704
I'm sorry. There's just so much
going on right now.

1155
01:17:55,837 --> 01:17:57,038
- Do you mind?
- Yeah.

1156
01:17:57,171 --> 01:17:58,205
It's crazy.

1157
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:00,408
Pretty nice here, you know.

1158
01:18:00,542 --> 01:18:02,711
Why, uh...
why do you have to leave?

1159
01:18:02,845 --> 01:18:05,347
- It's beautiful. It's just not safe.
- Right.

1160
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:07,047
Everyone's afraid.

1161
01:18:07,181 --> 01:18:10,618
Even your bunker got breached,
and you're all young and strong.

1162
01:18:10,752 --> 01:18:11,952
Yeah.

1163
01:18:12,087 --> 01:18:13,822
Hey, Aimee?

1164
01:18:13,956 --> 01:18:17,859
Sorry. I know you got, like,
a lot going on, but, uh...

1165
01:18:18,894 --> 01:18:22,063
you know, I came...
I came all the way here to see you,

1166
01:18:22,197 --> 01:18:25,734
and so I'm just...
checkin' in.

1167
01:18:25,868 --> 01:18:29,538
Just wondering how you're...
feeling about that.

1168
01:18:29,671 --> 01:18:32,106
I think it's the most romantic
thing anyone's ever done.

1169
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:34,809
You do? Okay.
Okay, good, 'cause, um...

1170
01:18:34,943 --> 01:18:37,445
But listen, Joel, um...

1171
01:18:37,578 --> 01:18:40,614
talking to you on the radio
was such a nice escape

1172
01:18:40,748 --> 01:18:42,818
from the stress
of running this colony.

1173
01:18:42,952 --> 01:18:44,586
Yeah.

1174
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:45,886
And, um...

1175
01:18:47,154 --> 01:18:50,557
I mean, you're probably the only
person left alive from my old life.

1176
01:18:51,024 --> 01:18:52,795
From Fairfield.

1177
01:18:56,029 --> 01:18:57,398
Oh. There's a...

1178
01:18:57,533 --> 01:19:00,970
There's a "but" coming,
isn't there?

1179
01:19:02,503 --> 01:19:05,908
But I didn't think
you'd actually come here, Joel.

1180
01:19:06,774 --> 01:19:08,143
Oh. Um...

1181
01:19:08,277 --> 01:19:10,346
And I am so happy
to see you.

1182
01:19:10,479 --> 01:19:11,847
I'm just not...

1183
01:19:12,847 --> 01:19:15,384
I'm not the same person
that I used to be, you know?

1184
01:19:15,516 --> 01:19:17,752
Seven years,
that's a long time.

1185
01:19:17,886 --> 01:19:21,323
I've... I've lost people.
My mom, my friends, and...

1186
01:19:21,990 --> 01:19:24,025
Last year I lost someone...

1187
01:19:25,493 --> 01:19:27,596
and he meant a lot to me.

1188
01:19:28,963 --> 01:19:30,265
Um...

1189
01:19:30,932 --> 01:19:32,268
Whew.

1190
01:19:51,587 --> 01:19:54,522
Oh, man, I feel
like such an idiot.

1191
01:19:54,655 --> 01:19:56,757
- No. No, don't.
- I didn't even...

1192
01:19:56,891 --> 01:19:59,827
I didn't even ask you
if I should come.

1193
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:03,164
I just got so excited,
and I... I left.

1194
01:20:03,297 --> 01:20:05,400
I don't know what I thought.

1195
01:20:06,634 --> 01:20:08,636
Well, I know
what I thought.

1196
01:20:08,770 --> 01:20:12,507
I'd come and...
and sweep you off your feet,

1197
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:14,775
and we'd be happy.

1198
01:20:14,908 --> 01:20:16,210
Oh, Joel.

1199
01:20:16,345 --> 01:20:21,250
But you...
didn't w-want... me.

1200
01:20:21,382 --> 01:20:25,386
I am so sorry. I should have
said something on the radio or...

1201
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:28,023
No. It's okay.
It's okay. Um...

1202
01:20:28,155 --> 01:20:31,393
I know this isn't how
you pictured this going, but...

1203
01:20:33,895 --> 01:20:35,630
you'll still
come with us, right?

1204
01:20:35,764 --> 01:20:39,702
Come with you...
Uh, on the... yacht?

1205
01:20:41,869 --> 01:20:44,105
This is our shot
at survival.

1206
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:48,010
Give Cap a chance.

1207
01:20:51,613 --> 01:20:53,782
Tell us.

1208
01:20:53,914 --> 01:20:56,118
Yeah, come on, Cap.
Tell us another story.

1209
01:20:56,251 --> 01:20:59,021
- Yeah, come on.
- Four years post-Agatha.

1210
01:20:59,154 --> 01:21:01,089
HMS Brisbane. First watch.

1211
01:21:01,221 --> 01:21:03,425
I was the first person
to see it coming over the wall.

1212
01:21:03,557 --> 01:21:06,094
Giant lizard, two stories high.

1213
01:21:06,862 --> 01:21:10,599
I sounded the alarm.
Too late.

1214
01:21:10,731 --> 01:21:13,600
We lost 1,032 souls that night.

1215
01:21:13,734 --> 01:21:15,903
Those of us that survived
took to the sea.

1216
01:21:16,037 --> 01:21:20,242
I mean, make no mistake.
We have lost this war. Right?

1217
01:21:20,375 --> 01:21:24,112
There is no place for mankind on land.
But out there?

1218
01:21:24,244 --> 01:21:26,247
There we got a chance.

1219
01:21:26,381 --> 01:21:28,483
I've got a...

1220
01:21:28,617 --> 01:21:31,485
Sorry. Just got a... question.

1221
01:21:31,618 --> 01:21:33,621
I survived seven days
on the surface,

1222
01:21:33,755 --> 01:21:38,092
and... if I can do that,
literally anyone can.

1223
01:21:38,225 --> 01:21:41,395
Seven days on the surface?
I'm impressed.

1224
01:21:41,529 --> 01:21:44,698
So maybe we still have
a chance... to fight

1225
01:21:44,832 --> 01:21:47,869
and... and, you know, win, uh...

1226
01:21:48,002 --> 01:21:50,537
win our...
win our world back.

1227
01:21:50,671 --> 01:21:55,009
I have a plan. And if you have a
better one, mate, I'm... I'm all ears.

1228
01:21:55,143 --> 01:21:58,078
- And I will stand by your side.
- You wanna hear my...

1229
01:21:58,212 --> 01:22:00,347
You wanna hear my plan?

1230
01:22:00,481 --> 01:22:01,817
It's, uh...

1231
01:22:02,650 --> 01:22:04,185
just, uh...

1232
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:12,327
I got nothing, uh...

1233
01:22:12,461 --> 01:22:13,927
Hey, that's on me.

1234
01:22:14,061 --> 01:22:16,963
I-I didn't mean to put you
on the spot, mate. It's...

1235
01:22:17,097 --> 01:22:20,768
Well... Aimee tells
me you make a mean minestrone.

1236
01:22:21,536 --> 01:22:22,871
And you're great
on the radio.

1237
01:22:23,003 --> 01:22:25,139
Lord knows
I need a comms expert.

1238
01:22:25,273 --> 01:22:28,710
Someone to teach Rocko how to cook.

1239
01:22:29,978 --> 01:22:33,815
Do you guys have a radio I could use?
I want to contact my colony.

1240
01:22:34,716 --> 01:22:38,220
7045, this is 3022.
Come in.

1241
01:22:40,555 --> 01:22:44,059
7045, this is 3022.
Is anyone there?

1242
01:22:44,193 --> 01:22:45,860
Tim? Ava?
Anyone. Over.

1243
01:22:45,993 --> 01:22:48,662
Cap thought you might
need a snack.

1244
01:22:48,796 --> 01:22:51,165
- Oh.
- You know, he brews his own beer.

1245
01:22:52,167 --> 01:22:54,603
- Yep. Yeah, I heard.
- It's good, man.

1246
01:22:54,735 --> 01:22:56,939
- Cool. Thank you.
- Yeah.

1247
01:23:50,926 --> 01:23:52,961
<i>Hello? Is someone there?</i>

1248
01:23:53,094 --> 01:23:54,229
Hey. Yeah! Yeah!

1249
01:23:54,362 --> 01:23:56,463
Yeah, Ray, is that you?
It's me. It's Joel.

1250
01:23:56,596 --> 01:23:58,099
<i>Joel?</i> <i>Oh, my God!</i>

1251
01:23:58,233 --> 01:24:00,768
<i>Hey, guys! It's Joel. He made it!</i>

1252
01:24:00,902 --> 01:24:02,936
- <i>You're kidding!</i>
- Hey. Hey, guys!

1253
01:24:03,070 --> 01:24:05,506
It's me. It's Joel.
I'm... I'm... I'm safe.

1254
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:07,742
I-I made it.
I'm at Aimee's colony.

1255
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:09,644
- <i>He made it!</i>
- <i>Oh, my God, you're alive?</i>

1256
01:24:09,777 --> 01:24:11,045
It's so good
to hear your guys' voices.

1257
01:24:11,179 --> 01:24:12,748
<i>So good
to hear you, too, buddy.</i>

1258
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:14,582
- <i>Are you okay?</i>
- I feel like it's been so long.

1259
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:17,251
- I've got so much to tell you guys.
- <i>Tell us what you've seen.</i>

1260
01:24:17,385 --> 01:24:21,155
- I saw a queen Sandgobbler.
- <i>What's a queen Sandgobbler?</i>

1261
01:24:21,288 --> 01:24:23,391
It's... I don't know,
but I blew it up.

1262
01:24:23,524 --> 01:24:25,027
I blew it up
with a hand grenade!

1263
01:24:25,159 --> 01:24:26,527
<i>Where'd you get a grenade?</i>

1264
01:24:26,661 --> 01:24:28,262
Yeah,
it was so awesome, and...

1265
01:24:28,396 --> 01:24:32,033
What else? What else?
Uh, I met these two really cool survivors.

1266
01:24:32,167 --> 01:24:35,737
And they taught me all these things.
They live on the surface and...

1267
01:24:35,871 --> 01:24:38,105
And, oh, oh, oh!
I met a Mav1s.

1268
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:41,742
- I talked to a real live Mav1s.
- <i>No way! What's she like?</i>

1269
01:24:41,876 --> 01:24:46,047
Uh, she was...
very informative, emotionally, and...

1270
01:24:47,515 --> 01:24:51,019
And I got a dog too, um...

1271
01:24:51,152 --> 01:24:54,590
- <i>Wow, Joel. You got a dog?</i>
- <i>And how is it with Aimee?</i>

1272
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:56,725
Uh, really...

1273
01:24:57,324 --> 01:24:58,961
really good.

1274
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:03,431
<i>Joel, you simply surviving
that journey, it's incredible.</i>

1275
01:25:03,564 --> 01:25:05,299
<i>We're proud of you, Joel.</i>

1276
01:25:06,734 --> 01:25:08,969
Man, I really miss you guys.

1277
01:25:10,238 --> 01:25:14,176
How is, uh... How is everything back there?
Give me the update.

1278
01:25:14,309 --> 01:25:17,145
<i>Not good.
We've had multiple breaches.</i>

1279
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:19,447
Multiple breaches? What do you mean?
Is everyone okay?

1280
01:25:19,579 --> 01:25:22,582
<i>Not really. I don't think
we can stay here much longer.</i>

1281
01:25:25,286 --> 01:25:26,654
Uh, guys?

1282
01:25:26,787 --> 01:25:28,289
<i>We're surviving for now.</i>

1283
01:25:28,422 --> 01:25:31,826
"Surviving for now."
What? Sur... Ray? Hey, guys!

1284
01:25:31,958 --> 01:25:34,630
Hey, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Shit.

1285
01:25:34,762 --> 01:25:38,166
Hello, guys, can you hear me?

1286
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:39,900
Guys?

1287
01:25:50,243 --> 01:25:51,947
I gotta go back.

1288
01:25:52,912 --> 01:25:54,815
What am I doing here?

1289
01:26:08,729 --> 01:26:10,699
Purple berries.

1290
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:22,309
<i>Giant lizard, two stories
high, coming over the wall.</i>

1291
01:26:22,444 --> 01:26:25,580
<i>The lizard-looking ones
can't climb for shit.</i>

1292
01:26:25,712 --> 01:26:27,448
Lying son of a bitch.

1293
01:26:28,882 --> 01:26:30,719
Son of a bitch!

1294
01:26:42,697 --> 01:26:45,300
Y'all like this shit, huh?

1295
01:26:45,434 --> 01:26:46,735
Aimee.

1296
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:48,937
Hey, hey. Aimee, Aimee, Aimee.

1297
01:26:49,069 --> 01:26:50,771
- Joel!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey.

1298
01:26:50,904 --> 01:26:52,873
- I have to talk to you.
- Joel!

1299
01:26:53,975 --> 01:26:55,309
Oh, you're so drunk.

1300
01:26:55,443 --> 01:27:00,681
Hot, super ripped, super awesome
Joely-Joely Dawson!

1301
01:27:00,815 --> 01:27:02,384
Aimee, please.

1302
01:27:02,516 --> 01:27:05,153
This is super important.
I need to talk to you about something.

1303
01:27:05,286 --> 01:27:08,122
You have to get everyone
out of here right now.

1304
01:27:08,256 --> 01:27:11,126
Okay, I think something bad is
about to happen. I'm telling you.

1305
01:27:11,259 --> 01:27:13,793
I can feel it. This is a bad...
This is a bad vibe.

1306
01:27:16,896 --> 01:27:19,835
I think he's planning something.
I don't think he's here to save you.

1307
01:27:19,967 --> 01:27:22,237
- Who?
- The yacht captain. He tried to poison me.

1308
01:27:22,369 --> 01:27:25,806
Cap. Cap's right there.
He's dancing.

1309
01:27:26,908 --> 01:27:30,144
Oh, my... I hate him.
I hate him so much.

1310
01:27:30,278 --> 01:27:32,579
Listen, he gave me
these poison berries, okay?

1311
01:27:32,713 --> 01:27:35,048
And I know that the berries are
poison because my dog told me.

1312
01:27:35,182 --> 01:27:36,850
You have a talking dog?

1313
01:27:36,984 --> 01:27:39,085
- No, no, no, Aimee.
- I love dogs!

1314
01:27:40,322 --> 01:27:43,759
What'd he say?
Where is the little fella?

1315
01:27:44,759 --> 01:27:45,826
Man down!

1316
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:47,429
Please.
Please try to listen to me.

1317
01:27:47,561 --> 01:27:49,764
I need your help.
Something's gonna happen.

1318
01:27:49,898 --> 01:27:51,833
Your colony,
they're in danger.

1319
01:27:51,966 --> 01:27:52,900
- Joel.
- What?

1320
01:27:53,033 --> 01:27:54,502
Joel!

1321
01:28:04,278 --> 01:28:06,280
Oh, shit.

1322
01:28:06,413 --> 01:28:08,682
- Aimee? Aimee?
- Joel? Joel, are you okay?

1323
01:28:08,815 --> 01:28:10,085
Good morning.

1324
01:28:10,217 --> 01:28:12,118
Joel, I'm sorry about
the fist to your face.

1325
01:28:12,252 --> 01:28:15,657
I couldn't have you talking shit about us
on the radio. I didn't wanna mess this up.

1326
01:28:15,789 --> 01:28:18,292
Dana, take care of it.

1327
01:28:19,894 --> 01:28:22,697
Dana, d-don't.
Not the radio tower!

1328
01:28:24,631 --> 01:28:28,002
- What are you doing?
- Are you crazy?

1329
01:28:28,136 --> 01:28:31,373
So, you probably figured out
we're not on a pleasure cruise.

1330
01:28:31,506 --> 01:28:34,643
My crew and I want to thank you
for your generous donations.

1331
01:28:34,775 --> 01:28:36,978
Food, water,
supplies, medicine.

1332
01:28:37,110 --> 01:28:38,813
We greatly appreciate it.

1333
01:28:38,945 --> 01:28:42,449
It will see us through to the next
helpless colony down the coast.

1334
01:28:42,582 --> 01:28:43,917
He's a food stealer!

1335
01:28:44,051 --> 01:28:45,786
- You're right.
- Yeah.

1336
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:49,157
But it's not that simple. The world
is basically devoid of fossil fuels.

1337
01:28:49,289 --> 01:28:51,192
Not enough to run
a yacht on, anyway.

1338
01:28:51,326 --> 01:28:54,561
So my crew and I,
we had to improvise just to survive.

1339
01:28:54,695 --> 01:28:58,131
And we found a real special fuel source.
Actually, Rocko did.

1340
01:28:58,265 --> 01:29:00,400
- Didn't ya, big fella?
- Yeah, that was me.

1341
01:29:00,534 --> 01:29:04,840
Ten tons of pure power,
chained to the front of that yacht.

1342
01:29:05,506 --> 01:29:07,108
She's sleeping now.

1343
01:29:08,609 --> 01:29:10,311
She will be hungry soon.

1344
01:29:17,953 --> 01:29:19,487
What?

1345
01:29:19,619 --> 01:29:21,355
Well, what can I say?

1346
01:29:23,123 --> 01:29:24,824
Shit gets crazy
in the apocalypse.

1347
01:29:24,958 --> 01:29:26,827
Oh, my God.

1348
01:29:48,448 --> 01:29:51,485
Oh, my God.

1349
01:29:52,386 --> 01:29:53,421
Run!

1350
01:30:02,529 --> 01:30:03,398
Rose!

1351
01:30:06,333 --> 01:30:09,336
Oh, my God, we're gonna die.

1352
01:30:13,207 --> 01:30:16,043
Mkay. Just gotta find a way
to free my hands from the...

1353
01:30:16,176 --> 01:30:18,511
Oh.

1354
01:30:18,645 --> 01:30:21,648
I have to stop these bastards
from taking our stuff!

1355
01:30:21,783 --> 01:30:23,351
Oh, my...

1356
01:30:24,451 --> 01:30:26,287
You traveled 85 miles
across hell.

1357
01:30:26,420 --> 01:30:28,189
I think
I can stop three assholes.

1358
01:30:28,323 --> 01:30:29,624
- You get the crab!
- What?

1359
01:30:31,759 --> 01:30:33,994
This is desperate.

1360
01:30:39,701 --> 01:30:42,203
Aimee?

1361
01:31:15,136 --> 01:31:17,438
Holy shit.

1362
01:31:17,570 --> 01:31:18,573
Holy shit.

1363
01:32:25,506 --> 01:32:27,207
No, no, no, no, no!

1364
01:32:35,682 --> 01:32:37,685
Boy? Boy!

1365
01:32:39,287 --> 01:32:41,489
Boy! Hey!

1366
01:32:45,792 --> 01:32:47,761
Dana? Shoot the dog.

1367
01:33:04,811 --> 01:33:06,113
Aimee!

1368
01:33:07,814 --> 01:33:09,451
No!

1369
01:33:11,284 --> 01:33:13,954
Rocko? Time to go. Let's mo...

1370
01:33:17,757 --> 01:33:19,326
Oh, no, you don't.

1371
01:33:21,529 --> 01:33:23,331
Boy! I need you
to listen to me right now.

1372
01:33:23,463 --> 01:33:26,501
You see over there?
Go get Aimee.

1373
01:33:26,634 --> 01:33:27,967
Let's move it!

1374
01:33:28,101 --> 01:33:29,737
Go now. Now. Now!

1375
01:33:29,869 --> 01:33:31,538
I'm sorry I yelled at you!

1376
01:33:37,845 --> 01:33:39,513
Move.

1377
01:33:46,087 --> 01:33:48,088
Okay, crab, you want some of...

1378
01:33:50,891 --> 01:33:52,359
Whoa!

1379
01:33:59,434 --> 01:34:01,769
Okay! Whoa! Whoa!

1380
01:34:01,903 --> 01:34:04,905
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Listen.
You don't wanna do this.

1381
01:34:14,448 --> 01:34:16,584
Oh, no!

1382
01:34:24,925 --> 01:34:26,461
- Joel!
- Aimee!

1383
01:34:26,594 --> 01:34:29,697
Aimee! Aimee, throw me the cannon!
I know how to kill it!

1384
01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:52,020
You can always tell in the eyes.

1385
01:34:52,153 --> 01:34:55,456
- What are you doing? Shoot it!
- Shoot it! What are you waiting for?

1386
01:34:55,590 --> 01:34:58,726
- Kill it!
- Goddamn it, shoot it!

1387
01:35:00,027 --> 01:35:01,261
Needle through water.

1388
01:35:04,765 --> 01:35:06,066
Cap?

1389
01:35:14,073 --> 01:35:17,244
You're free.

1390
01:35:48,242 --> 01:35:50,244
Oh, my God.

1391
01:35:57,618 --> 01:36:00,655
Oh, shit, we're gonna die.
We're dying.

1392
01:36:07,927 --> 01:36:10,163
No!

1393
01:36:31,219 --> 01:36:32,619
That was amazing.

1394
01:36:32,752 --> 01:36:33,953
What? Uh...

1395
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:36,157
- Amazing? Me?
- Yeah.

1396
01:36:36,289 --> 01:36:37,692
You thought I was...

1397
01:36:45,265 --> 01:36:47,034
- Thank you, Joel.
- Yeah?

1398
01:36:47,167 --> 01:36:51,005
Yeah, well, I would've done it
different, but... you did all right.

1399
01:36:51,137 --> 01:36:52,974
Oh. Okay.

1400
01:36:53,106 --> 01:36:55,609
Sorry. Yeah, just...

1401
01:36:55,743 --> 01:36:57,477
That's looking better.
Take care of it.

1402
01:36:57,610 --> 01:36:59,079
- Bye now.
- Bye, guys.

1403
01:37:00,381 --> 01:37:02,850
- Can you move this? Yeah.
- Aimee.

1404
01:37:06,587 --> 01:37:08,422
- Hey.
- Hey. Um...

1405
01:37:08,555 --> 01:37:11,925
I gotta get back to my colony,
see if they're okay.

1406
01:37:12,059 --> 01:37:13,961
Right, yeah. Yeah.

1407
01:37:14,094 --> 01:37:17,265
Some friends of mine told me that
there's a place in the mountains,

1408
01:37:17,398 --> 01:37:19,266
I guess,
that's safe from the monsters.

1409
01:37:19,399 --> 01:37:21,868
So maybe
we'll all head there.

1410
01:37:22,002 --> 01:37:23,171
Oh.

1411
01:37:23,304 --> 01:37:27,240
Um, it was really cool to just...
to see you in action,

1412
01:37:27,375 --> 01:37:32,612
and... I don't know, how you take
care of all these people, and then...

1413
01:37:32,746 --> 01:37:35,949
- Oh.
- I'm so glad you came.

1414
01:37:40,121 --> 01:37:41,154
I gotta go.

1415
01:37:41,287 --> 01:37:43,022
I'm worried about 'em.

1416
01:37:43,157 --> 01:37:44,559
Yeah.

1417
01:37:45,626 --> 01:37:48,463
But I had something
for you. Um...

1418
01:37:49,063 --> 01:37:50,965
Oh, my God.

1419
01:37:51,097 --> 01:37:52,265
Crocodile Carl?

1420
01:37:52,399 --> 01:37:54,467
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

1421
01:37:54,601 --> 01:37:57,704
Thought you should
have him back finally.

1422
01:37:58,872 --> 01:37:59,906
Here, uh...

1423
01:38:01,240 --> 01:38:03,644
- No, I can't take that. You need it.
- No, no, no.

1424
01:38:03,777 --> 01:38:06,547
I want you to take it.
It'd mean a lot to me.

1425
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:08,649
Really, take it.

1426
01:38:10,117 --> 01:38:13,354
I got it all up here, anyway.
So I can always make copies.

1427
01:38:13,487 --> 01:38:16,056
Thanks for
inspiring me to...

1428
01:38:17,356 --> 01:38:19,393
take this trip.

1429
01:38:19,525 --> 01:38:21,496
It's the best decision
I ever made.

1430
01:38:22,662 --> 01:38:26,065
All right,
uh, I'm gonna go.

1431
01:38:26,199 --> 01:38:28,234
- Yeah.
- Boy, come on!

1432
01:38:28,368 --> 01:38:30,337
Um...

1433
01:38:30,470 --> 01:38:32,939
- Uh, be careful.
- Yeah, you, too.

1434
01:38:34,608 --> 01:38:36,411
- Bye, Aimee.
- Bye.

1435
01:38:59,432 --> 01:39:00,935
That was...

1436
01:39:01,068 --> 01:39:03,003
- Great.
- Yeah.

1437
01:39:10,310 --> 01:39:12,046
I'll come find you.

1438
01:39:14,381 --> 01:39:15,849
You better.

1439
01:39:20,354 --> 01:39:21,588
Okay.

1440
01:39:30,997 --> 01:39:33,033
<i>My name is Joel Dawson.</i>

1441
01:39:33,167 --> 01:39:37,672
<i>I'm 24 years old,
and I survived seven days on the surface.</i>

1442
01:39:45,645 --> 01:39:47,215
<i>Twice, actually.</i>

1443
01:39:59,059 --> 01:40:00,293
- Joel?
- Joel?

1444
01:40:00,427 --> 01:40:02,662
You guys! Hey!

1445
01:40:02,796 --> 01:40:05,065
- Oh, my God!
- Hey, hey, hey!

1446
01:40:18,244 --> 01:40:21,481
I'm alive because of the
generosity of a few strangers

1447
01:40:21,614 --> 01:40:24,885
and the kindness
of a great dog.

1448
01:40:26,653 --> 01:40:29,088
<i>My colony and I
are headed to the mountains.</i>

1449
01:40:29,221 --> 01:40:31,992
<i>There's supposed to be
less monsters there.</i>

1450
01:40:32,126 --> 01:40:36,496
<i>And don't get me wrong.
The surface is a dangerous place.</i>

1451
01:40:36,630 --> 01:40:40,434
<i>But I don't think hiding
underground is the answer anymore.</i>

1452
01:40:40,568 --> 01:40:45,773
<i>There is a great big, beautiful,
inspiring world out there.</i>

1453
01:40:45,905 --> 01:40:49,609
<i>And I know you think it
might be impossible, but it's not.</i>

1454
01:40:49,743 --> 01:40:51,911
<i>If I can survive out here,
anybody can.</i>

1455
01:40:52,046 --> 01:40:54,280
<i>It's like a good friend
once told me.</i>

1456
01:40:54,413 --> 01:40:57,184
<i>Good instincts are earned
by making mistakes.</i>

1457
01:40:57,317 --> 01:40:59,786
<i>If you're lucky enough
to survive a few mistakes,</i>

1458
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:01,587
<i>you're gonna
do all right out here.</i>

1459
01:41:01,720 --> 01:41:05,625
<i>In this recording, you'll find
everything I know about our new world.</i>

1460
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:07,628
<i>Most of this
I had to learn the hard way.</i>

1461
01:41:07,761 --> 01:41:10,063
<i>Hopefully, it'll make your way
a little easier.</i>

1462
01:41:10,698 --> 01:41:13,467
<i>So crank open that hatch.</i>

1463
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:14,935
Okay, come on.

1464
01:41:15,069 --> 01:41:18,972
<i>Breathe some fresh air.
Go. Live your life.</i>

1465
01:41:20,039 --> 01:41:23,176
<i>It won't be easy,
but it'll be worth it.</i>

1466
01:41:24,679 --> 01:41:28,983
<i>I traveled 85 miles to find what I had
been missing below ground for seven years</i>

1467
01:41:29,115 --> 01:41:31,585
<i>was right above my head
this whole time.</i>

1468
01:41:31,719 --> 01:41:33,420
<i>And it's incredible.</i>

1469
01:41:34,454 --> 01:41:37,457
<i>Oh, and one last thing.
Don't settle.</i>

1470
01:41:37,591 --> 01:41:41,762
<i>You don't have to.
Not even at the end of the world.</i>

1471
01:41:49,636 --> 01:41:51,338
<i>Signing off,</i>

1472
01:41:51,470 --> 01:41:53,239
<i>Joel Dawson.</i>

1473
01:42:21,801 --> 01:42:24,270
"Don't settle"?
That's my line.

1474
01:42:24,404 --> 01:42:27,173
It's a long journey, kid.
I hope you know what you're doing.

1475
01:42:27,306 --> 01:42:30,109
He definitely doesn't.
Snow Spiders will probably get him.

1476
01:42:30,243 --> 01:42:31,744
That's not a good way to go.

1477
01:42:31,877 --> 01:42:33,246
They will tear him apart.

1478
01:42:33,380 --> 01:42:36,417
- Nah, he'll figure it out.
- Possibly.

1479
