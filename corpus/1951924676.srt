1
00:03:54,515 --> 00:03:55,774
Three of a kind. Let's do this.

2
00:03:56,325 --> 00:03:57,453
That's it? Three guys?

3
00:03:57,454 --> 00:04:00,084
Two guys on the roof.
Every guy gets a share.

4
00:04:00,085 --> 00:04:01,086
Five shares is plenty.

5
00:04:01,087 --> 00:04:03,675
Six shares. Don't forget the
guy who planned the job.

6
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:06,020
He thinks he can sit it out
and still take a slice?

7
00:04:06,021 --> 00:04:07,952
I know why they call him the Joker.

8
00:04:07,953 --> 00:04:09,264
So why do they call him the Joker?

9
00:04:09,542 --> 00:04:10,682
I heard he wears makeup.

10
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:11,684
Makeup?

11
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:13,422
Yeah! to scare people.
You know, warpaint?

12
00:04:25,883 --> 00:04:28,164
Alright everybody, hands up
heads down!

13
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,152
I said, hands up,
heads down!

14
00:04:32,153 --> 00:04:35,331
Let's go pal! I'm
making a withdrawal here.

15
00:04:35,332 --> 00:04:37,293
Put your hands up!

16
00:04:37,728 --> 00:04:39,177
Here comes the silent alarm.

17
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,170
There it goes.

18
00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:42,173
Heads down!

19
00:04:45,363 --> 00:04:47,067
Get down. I said stay
down there!

20
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:51,442
That's funny it didn't dial out to 911.
I was trying to reach a private number.

21
00:04:51,443 --> 00:04:52,301
Is it a problem?

22
00:04:52,302 --> 00:04:53,303
No, I'm done here...

23
00:05:12,065 --> 00:05:17,177
Obviously we don't want you doing anything
with your hands other than holding on for dear life.

24
00:05:25,494 --> 00:05:27,468
On the ground! Stay on the ground!

25
00:05:27,469 --> 00:05:30,046
Nobody make a move! Nobody!

26
00:05:30,047 --> 00:05:31,418
Stay down!

27
00:05:47,538 --> 00:05:48,249
Come here!

28
00:05:51,192 --> 00:05:53,513
Do you have any idea who
you're stealing from?

29
00:05:53,672 --> 00:05:55,191
You and your friends are dead!

30
00:05:55,192 --> 00:05:56,909
He's out, right?

31
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,211
Where did you learn to count?

32
00:06:14,103 --> 00:06:16,340
They wired this thing up with like 5000 Volts.

33
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:17,343
What kind of bank does that?

34
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:18,345
A mob bank.

35
00:06:18,346 --> 00:06:20,758
I guess the Joker is
as crazy as they say.

36
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:21,760
Where is the alarm guy?

37
00:06:21,761 --> 00:06:24,333
The boss told me when the guy
was done, I should take him out.

38
00:06:24,571 --> 00:06:26,253
One less share, right?

39
00:06:27,067 --> 00:06:29,401
Funny... He told me something similar.

40
00:06:29,402 --> 00:06:30,985
He what? No, no!

41
00:06:43,254 --> 00:06:48,127
That's a lot of money. If this Joker guy was so
smart he'd had us bring a bigger car.

42
00:06:49,735 --> 00:06:53,371
I'm betting the Joker told you to kill
me as soon as we loaded the cash.

43
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,738
No, no, no, no...
I kill the bus driver.

44
00:06:58,942 --> 00:07:00,079
Bus driver?

45
00:07:02,016 --> 00:07:03,454
What bus driver?

46
00:07:07,872 --> 00:07:09,633
School's out. Time to go.

47
00:07:10,036 --> 00:07:11,641
Cat's not getting up, is he?

48
00:07:13,034 --> 00:07:14,141
That's a lot of money.

49
00:07:17,963 --> 00:07:19,553
What happened to the rest of the guys?

50
00:07:27,412 --> 00:07:28,638
You think you're smart, huh?

51
00:07:30,115 --> 00:07:31,897
Well, the guy that hired you

52
00:07:32,281 --> 00:07:34,172
will just do the same with you.

53
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:38,299
Ah, criminals in this town used
to believe in things.

54
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:43,778
Honor, respect! Look at you!
What do you believe in?

55
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:45,635
Huh, what do you believe in?

56
00:07:45,636 --> 00:07:50,206
I believe whatever doesn't kill
you simply makes you...

57
00:07:52,341 --> 00:07:54,180
stranger.

58
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:39,791
Mr. Mayor, you were elected in
the campaign to clean up the city.

59
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:40,793
When are you going to start?

60
00:08:40,794 --> 00:08:42,115
Well, Mike, I believe I already have.

61
00:08:42,116 --> 00:08:44,416
Like the so-called Batman? We're
hearing that he's doing some good.

62
00:08:44,417 --> 00:08:46,132
That criminals are running scared.
But I say...

63
00:08:46,133 --> 00:08:48,078
Nah, man... I don't like it tonight.

64
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,913
What are you? Superstitious?

65
00:08:49,914 --> 00:08:52,501
You got more chance of winning
the powerball than running into him.

66
00:08:52,502 --> 00:08:54,762
That simply is not true.
I'm told that

67
00:08:54,763 --> 00:08:56,268
Our men in the major crimes unit
are close to...

68
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:59,149
Mayor says you're closing
in on the Batman.

69
00:08:59,714 --> 00:09:02,188
The investigation is ongoing.

70
00:09:11,108 --> 00:09:13,250
Ever intending to see your wife
again, lieutenant?

71
00:09:13,251 --> 00:09:15,571
I thought you had to go
look after your mother, detective?

72
00:09:16,235 --> 00:09:17,559
Checked her back into the hospital.

73
00:09:18,607 --> 00:09:19,478
Sorry.

74
00:09:20,897 --> 00:09:21,958
So he hasn't shown up?

75
00:09:22,303 --> 00:09:23,456
I hope he doesn't.

76
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,405
I like reminding everybody
that he's out there.

77
00:09:26,737 --> 00:09:27,857
Why wouldn't he come?

78
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:31,281
Hopefully because he is busy.

79
00:09:48,484 --> 00:09:50,945
That's why we bring dogs.

80
00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:53,626
Hey, my filhotinhos.

81
00:09:57,729 --> 00:09:59,727
Look what your drugs
did to my customers.

82
00:10:00,773 --> 00:10:05,273
Buyer beware. I told you
my compound would take you places.

83
00:10:05,802 --> 00:10:08,547
I never said they'd be places
you wanted to go.

84
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:11,006
My business repeat customers.

85
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,316
If you don't like what I have to offer
you can buy from someone else.

86
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,898
Assuming Batman left
anyone to buy from...

87
00:10:21,703 --> 00:10:24,319
My dogs are hungry!

88
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,445
Pity there is only one of you.

89
00:10:40,196 --> 00:10:41,172
That's not him.

90
00:10:59,509 --> 00:11:00,737
That's more like it.

91
00:12:29,901 --> 00:12:31,384
Don't let me find you out here again.

92
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,063
We are trying to help you.

93
00:12:33,421 --> 00:12:34,353
I don't need help!

94
00:12:34,627 --> 00:12:35,847
Not my diagnosis.

95
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,263
What gives you the right?

96
00:12:37,943 --> 00:12:39,420
What's the difference between you and me?

97
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,902
I'm not wearing hockey pads.

98
00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:52,691
He can't resist showing us
his face.

99
00:12:57,991 --> 00:12:59,497
What's he hiding
under that makeup?

100
00:13:07,937 --> 00:13:09,887
Can we get a minute,
people, please?

101
00:13:12,815 --> 00:13:15,211
Him again?
Who were the others?

102
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:16,802
Another bunch of smalltimers.

103
00:13:17,948 --> 00:13:19,646
Some of the marked
bills I gave you.

104
00:13:19,647 --> 00:13:22,060
My detectives have been making
drug buys with them for weeks.

105
00:13:22,061 --> 00:13:25,014
This bank puts another draft of the mob.
That makes five.

106
00:13:25,015 --> 00:13:26,625
We found a bulk of the dirty cash.

107
00:13:26,626 --> 00:13:27,793
Time to move in.

108
00:13:27,794 --> 00:13:32,084
We would have to hit all banks
simultaneously. Swat teams, backup.

109
00:13:32,085 --> 00:13:33,855
What about this Joker guy?

110
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:36,891
One man or the entire mob?
He can wait.

111
00:13:36,892 --> 00:13:39,281
When the new DA hears
about this, he'll want in.

112
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,603
Do you trust him?

113
00:13:40,604 --> 00:13:44,970
It'd be hard to keep him out.
I hear he is as stubborn as you are.

114
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,524
It would be nice when Wayne
manor is rebuilt.

115
00:14:32,834 --> 00:14:36,893
You can swap not sleeping in a penthouse
to not sleeping in a mansion.

116
00:14:37,088 --> 00:14:41,127
Whenever you stich yourself up
you do make a bloody mess.

117
00:14:41,128 --> 00:14:43,863
Yeah. It makes me
learn from my mistakes.

118
00:14:44,061 --> 00:14:46,698
You ought to be pretty
knowledgable by now.

119
00:14:49,212 --> 00:14:53,962
My armor. Carrying too
much weight. I need to be faster.

120
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,952
I'm sure Mr. Fox
can oblige.

121
00:14:57,093 --> 00:14:58,689
Did you get mauled by a tiger?

122
00:14:58,690 --> 00:14:59,691
It was a dog.

123
00:14:59,692 --> 00:15:01,586
- Ah?
- It was a big dog.

124
00:15:03,109 --> 00:15:06,198
More copycats last night,
Alfred. With guns.

125
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:08,436
Why don't you hire them
and take a weekend off?

126
00:15:08,437 --> 00:15:13,909
That wasn't... exactly what I had in mind
when I said I wanted to inspire people.

127
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:14,912
I know.

128
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,904
But things have improved.
Look at the new district attorney.

129
00:15:20,061 --> 00:15:21,997
I am. Closely.

130
00:15:22,387 --> 00:15:24,041
I need to know if he can be trusted.

131
00:15:24,542 --> 00:15:27,882
Are you interested in his character
or... his sexual circle?

132
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:35,468
Who Rachel spends her time
with is her business.

133
00:15:37,357 --> 00:15:39,587
I trust you don't have
me followed on my day off.

134
00:15:39,588 --> 00:15:40,931
If you ever took
one I might.

135
00:15:43,478 --> 00:15:45,384
Know your limits, Master Wayne.

136
00:15:45,385 --> 00:15:48,360
Batman has no limits.

137
00:15:48,788 --> 00:15:50,038
Well you do, sir.

138
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:51,820
Well, I can't afford to know them.

139
00:15:51,821 --> 00:15:54,169
What's going to happen on
the day that you find out?

140
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:57,033
We'll all know how much you
like to say: "I told you so"

141
00:15:57,034 --> 00:16:02,252
On that day, Master Wayne, even
l won't want to. Probably.

142
00:16:09,342 --> 00:16:10,613
Sorry I'm late, folks.

143
00:16:14,789 --> 00:16:15,767
Where were you?

144
00:16:15,768 --> 00:16:17,061
Worried you'd have to step up?

145
00:16:17,062 --> 00:16:19,592
Harvey, I know these
briefs backwards.

146
00:16:19,593 --> 00:16:24,530
Fair's fair.
Heads, I'll take it. Tails, he's all yours.

147
00:16:24,531 --> 00:16:26,965
Oh yeah? You want to flip a coin
to see who leads?

148
00:16:26,966 --> 00:16:28,077
It's my father's lucky coin.

149
00:16:28,468 --> 00:16:30,481
As I recall, it got me my
first date with you.

150
00:16:30,482 --> 00:16:32,579
You wouldn't leave something
like that up to chance.

151
00:16:33,927 --> 00:16:36,846
I don't.
I make my own luck.

152
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:41,854
All rise!
The Honorable Judge Surrillo presiding.

153
00:16:42,811 --> 00:16:45,213
I thought the DA just plays
golf with the mayor or things like that.

154
00:16:45,363 --> 00:16:49,218
Tee-off is 1:30. More than enough time
to put you away for life, Salli.

155
00:16:49,319 --> 00:16:53,147
With Carmine Falcone in Arkham, someone must have
stepped up to run this so-called family.

156
00:16:54,975 --> 00:17:00,742
Is that man in this courtroom today?
Could you identify him for us please?

157
00:17:00,973 --> 00:17:02,966
You win, counsellor.

158
00:17:04,627 --> 00:17:05,988
It was me!

159
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:11,780
I have a sworn statement
from you, that this man,

160
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:15,550
Salvatore Maroni, is the new
head of the Falcone crime family.

161
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:19,844
Maroni? He is a fallguy!
I'm the brains of the organization.

162
00:17:21,156 --> 00:17:21,907
Order, order!

163
00:17:22,358 --> 00:17:23,489
Permission to treat
the witness as hostile.

164
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:23,909
Granted.

165
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,833
Hostile?
I'll show you hostile!

166
00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:34,225
Carbon fiber,
.28 caliber, made in China.

167
00:17:34,226 --> 00:17:37,467
If you want to kill a public servant, Mr. Maroni,
l recommend you buy American.

168
00:17:39,128 --> 00:17:40,329
Get him out of here!

169
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,931
But, your honor, I'm not done!

170
00:17:45,424 --> 00:17:47,338
We will never be able to link
the gun to Maroni,

171
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:49,366
so we won't be able to
charge him, but the fact

172
00:17:49,391 --> 00:17:51,928
they are trying to kill you,
means we are getting to them.

173
00:17:51,929 --> 00:17:55,286
Well I'm glad you're so pleased Rachel.
And I'm fine, by the way.

174
00:17:55,287 --> 00:17:57,870
Come on Harvey, you are Gotham's DA!
If you are not getting shot at,...

175
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,401
you're not doing your job right.

176
00:18:00,265 --> 00:18:04,507
But you know, he said if you were rattled
you could take the rest of the day off.

177
00:18:04,508 --> 00:18:08,162
I can't. I dragged the Head of
the major crimes unit down here.

178
00:18:08,237 --> 00:18:12,166
Jim Gordon? He's a friend actually,
try to be nice!

179
00:18:21,777 --> 00:18:24,181
I hear you got a
hell of a right cross.

180
00:18:27,884 --> 00:18:30,203
It's a shame Sal's gonna walk.

181
00:18:30,204 --> 00:18:31,650
Yeah, well good thing about the mob is...

182
00:18:31,651 --> 00:18:33,371
They keep giving you second chances.

183
00:18:39,349 --> 00:18:43,954
Lightly radiated bills.
Fancy stuff for a city cop.

184
00:18:44,174 --> 00:18:44,805
Have helped?

185
00:18:44,936 --> 00:18:46,930
We have links with various agents...

186
00:18:46,931 --> 00:18:48,720
Save it Gordon, I want to meet him.

187
00:18:48,721 --> 00:18:52,379
Official policy is to arrest the
vigilante known as Batman on sight.

188
00:18:52,446 --> 00:18:54,977
Uhum... And what about that floodlight
on the top of MCU?

189
00:18:54,997 --> 00:18:57,788
If you've got problems
with malfunctioning equipment,

190
00:18:57,789 --> 00:19:00,110
I suggest you take them up
with maintenance counselor.

191
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:03,614
I put every known money launderer
in Gotham, behind bars,

192
00:19:03,615 --> 00:19:05,237
but the Mob is still getting its money.

193
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:10,135
I think you and your friend,
have found the last game in town

194
00:19:10,136 --> 00:19:13,579
and are trying to hit them where it hurts:
their wallets. That's bold.

195
00:19:15,267 --> 00:19:16,393
You gonna count me in?

196
00:19:16,794 --> 00:19:19,955
In this town the fewer people know
something, the safer the operation.

197
00:19:20,056 --> 00:19:22,545
Gordon, I don't like that you've got your
own special unit and

198
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,514
I don't like that is full of cops
l investigated at internal affairs.

199
00:19:25,515 --> 00:19:30,138
If I had to work with cops you investigated while you
were licking your name at IAIP working alone.

200
00:19:30,859 --> 00:19:32,807
I don't get political points
for being an idealist.

201
00:19:32,808 --> 00:19:34,662
I have to do the best I can
with what I have.

202
00:19:38,381 --> 00:19:40,869
You want me to back warrants
for search and seizure

203
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:44,197
on five banks without telling
me what we're after?

204
00:19:45,126 --> 00:19:48,130
Well, I can give you
the names of the banks.

205
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:49,835
Well, that's a start.

206
00:19:50,643 --> 00:19:52,936
I'll get you your warrants,
but I want your trust.

207
00:19:53,337 --> 00:19:57,412
You don't have to sell me, Dent. We all
know you're Gotham's white knight.

208
00:19:58,893 --> 00:20:01,546
I heard they have a different name
for me down at MCU.

209
00:20:02,266 --> 00:20:03,698
I wouldn't know about that.

210
00:20:04,802 --> 00:20:08,545
In China, Lau Security Investments
stands for dynamic new growth.

211
00:20:08,755 --> 00:20:12,711
The joint Chinese venture with
Wayne Enterprises will be a powerhouse.

212
00:20:13,109 --> 00:20:17,576
Well, Mr Lau. I speak
for the rest of the board...

213
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,567
And Mr. Wayne,
in expressing our own excitement.

214
00:20:26,646 --> 00:20:30,880
Sir, I know that Mr. Wayne is curious
about how his trust fund gets replenished

215
00:20:30,932 --> 00:20:32,874
But frankly...
This is embarrasing!

216
00:20:33,134 --> 00:20:35,198
You worry about the delegace,
Mr. Reese.

217
00:20:35,844 --> 00:20:37,405
I'll worry about Bruce Wayne.

218
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:41,624
It's done.
The numbers are solid.

219
00:20:41,924 --> 00:20:46,296
Do them again. Wouldn't want the
trust fund to run out, now would we?

220
00:20:49,533 --> 00:20:54,759
Another long night? This joint venture
was your idea and the consultants love it.

221
00:20:55,059 --> 00:20:59,314
But I am not convinced. Lau's company
has grown by 8% anually like clockwork.

222
00:20:59,945 --> 00:21:03,760
His revenue stream must be
off the books. It may be even illegal.

223
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,032
OK, cancel the deal.

224
00:21:07,265 --> 00:21:08,716
You already knew?

225
00:21:08,946 --> 00:21:11,440
I just needed a closer look at their books.

226
00:21:12,042 --> 00:21:13,713
Anything else you can trouble me for?

227
00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:15,184
I need a new suit.

228
00:21:16,013 --> 00:21:18,587
Yeah... 3 buttons is a little
90's, Mr. Wayne.

229
00:21:18,868 --> 00:21:22,081
I am not talking fashion
Mr Fox, so much as function.

230
00:21:22,808 --> 00:21:26,762
- Want to be able to turn your head?
- Sure would make backing out of the driveway easier.

231
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:28,559
I'll see what I can do.

232
00:21:33,786 --> 00:21:35,833
It took me 3 weeks to
get a reservation here.

233
00:21:35,834 --> 00:21:37,933
And I had to tell them
l work for the government.

234
00:21:37,968 --> 00:21:38,683
Really?

235
00:21:38,684 --> 00:21:40,756
This city health inspector is
not afraid to pull strings.

236
00:21:41,142 --> 00:21:43,154
Rachel!
Fancy that!

237
00:21:43,486 --> 00:21:46,226
Yeah Bruce, fancy that.

238
00:21:46,453 --> 00:21:48,332
Rachel, Natasha.
Natasha, Rachel.

239
00:21:48,342 --> 00:21:53,519
- Natasha, are you the...
- The prima ballerina from the Moscow ballet.

240
00:21:53,889 --> 00:21:55,431
Wow, Harvey's
taking me next week.

241
00:21:55,935 --> 00:21:57,633
Really?
So you're into ballet?

242
00:21:58,028 --> 00:22:00,305
Bruce, this is Harvey Dent.

243
00:22:00,607 --> 00:22:04,191
The famous Bruce Wayne.
Rachel's told me everything about you.

244
00:22:04,373 --> 00:22:05,580
Well, I certainly hope not.

245
00:22:06,203 --> 00:22:07,718
So, let's put a couple of tables together.

246
00:22:08,219 --> 00:22:11,764
- I'm not sure that they'll let us.
- Oh they should. I own the place.

247
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,458
How could want to raise children
in a city like this?

248
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,991
Well, I was raised here.
I turned out OK.

249
00:22:18,343 --> 00:22:19,820
Is Wayne manor in the city limits?

250
00:22:20,848 --> 00:22:23,254
The Palisades.

251
00:22:23,323 --> 00:22:24,411
You know as our new DA,

252
00:22:24,412 --> 00:22:27,292
you might want to figure out
where your jurisdiction ends.

253
00:22:28,122 --> 00:22:32,078
I'm talking about the kind of city
that idolizes a masked vigilante.

254
00:22:32,164 --> 00:22:35,517
Gotham City is proud of an ordinary
citizen standing up for what's right.

255
00:22:35,619 --> 00:22:38,158
Gotham needs heroes
like you, elected officials.

256
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,822
And not a man who
thinks he's above the law.

257
00:22:39,915 --> 00:22:41,988
- Exactly. Who appointed the Batman?
- We did.

258
00:22:42,247 --> 00:22:45,651
All of us who stood by
and let scum take control of our city.

259
00:22:45,661 --> 00:22:47,352
But this is a democracy, Harvey.

260
00:22:47,482 --> 00:22:49,041
When their enemies were at the gates,

261
00:22:49,042 --> 00:22:52,550
the Romans would suspend democracy
and appoint one man to protect the city.

262
00:22:53,126 --> 00:22:55,902
It wasn't considered an honor.
It was considered a public service.

263
00:22:55,969 --> 00:23:00,180
Harvey, the last man that they appointed
to protect the republic was named Caesar,

264
00:23:00,181 --> 00:23:01,532
and he never gave up his power.

265
00:23:02,101 --> 00:23:05,273
OK, fine.
You either die a hero...

266
00:23:05,374 --> 00:23:08,064
or you live long enough to see
yourself become the villain.

267
00:23:08,467 --> 00:23:12,923
Look. Whoever the Batman is, he doesn't
want to do this for the rest of his life.

268
00:23:12,993 --> 00:23:15,690
Batman is looking for someone
to take up his mantle.

269
00:23:15,807 --> 00:23:21,152
- Someone like you, Mr. Dent?
- Maybe. If I'm up to it.

270
00:23:21,153 --> 00:23:25,665
- What if Harvey Dent is
the caped crusader?

271
00:23:28,331 --> 00:23:31,585
- If I were sneaking out every night,
someone would have noticed by now.

272
00:23:34,088 --> 00:23:38,273
Well... I'm sold that I'm going
to throw you a fundraiser.

273
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:41,497
That's nice of you Bruce, but
I'm not up for reelection for 3 years.

274
00:23:41,647 --> 00:23:45,230
No, you don't understand.
One fundraiser with my pals,

275
00:23:46,732 --> 00:23:48,500
you'll never need another cent.

276
00:24:03,523 --> 00:24:05,134
What the hell is this?

277
00:24:07,302 --> 00:24:10,394
As you all are aware, one of
our deposits was stolen.

278
00:24:10,614 --> 00:24:13,859
A relatively small amount.
68 million.

279
00:24:14,285 --> 00:24:16,860
Who is stupid enough to steal from us?

280
00:24:16,861 --> 00:24:20,385
2-bit wackjob, wears a cheap
purple suit and makeup.

281
00:24:20,903 --> 00:24:22,457
He's not the problem.
He's a nobody.

282
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:26,150
The problem is our money
being tracked by the cops.

283
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:28,523
Thanks to Mr. Maroni's
well placed sources,

284
00:24:28,524 --> 00:24:31,274
we know that police have
indeed identified our banks

285
00:24:31,456 --> 00:24:35,571
using marked bills and are planning
to seize your funds today.

286
00:24:35,672 --> 00:24:39,971
And since the enthusiastic new DA has
put all my competitors out of business,

287
00:24:39,972 --> 00:24:42,099
I'm your only option.

288
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,307
So what do you propose?

289
00:24:43,943 --> 00:24:46,267
Moving all deposits
to one secure location.

290
00:24:46,666 --> 00:24:48,465
- Not a bank.
- Where then?

291
00:24:48,466 --> 00:24:50,329
Nobody can know, but me.

292
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:55,352
If the police were to gain leverage over one
of you, everyone's money would be at stake.

293
00:24:55,555 --> 00:24:57,562
What stop them getting to you?

294
00:24:57,563 --> 00:25:00,570
I go to Hong Kong.
Far from Dent's jurisdiction

295
00:25:01,248 --> 00:25:03,525
And the Chinese will not extradite
one of their own.

296
00:25:04,476 --> 00:25:05,981
How soon can we move the money?

297
00:25:06,257 --> 00:25:07,820
I already have.

298
00:25:09,802 --> 00:25:12,324
For obvious reasons, I couldn't
wait for your permission.

299
00:25:12,915 --> 00:25:16,009
Rest assured your money is safe.

300
00:25:29,174 --> 00:25:31,406
And I thought my
jokes were bad.

301
00:25:31,436 --> 00:25:34,331
Give me one reason why I shouldn't
have my boy here pull your head off.

302
00:25:34,421 --> 00:25:35,893
How about a magic trick?

303
00:25:39,184 --> 00:25:41,873
I'm going to make
this pencil disappear.

304
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:48,402
Tahdah! It's gone!

305
00:25:49,498 --> 00:25:51,729
Oh, and by the way,
the suit, it wasn't cheap.

306
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:53,520
You ought to know,
you bought it!

307
00:25:53,903 --> 00:25:58,301
Easy.
I want to hear the opposition.

308
00:26:01,513 --> 00:26:04,010
Let's wind the clock back a year.

309
00:26:04,011 --> 00:26:09,338
These cops and lawyers wouldn't dare
cross any of you.

310
00:26:12,596 --> 00:26:15,914
What happened?
Did your balls drop off?

311
00:26:17,829 --> 00:26:21,061
- You see a guy like me...
- A freak!

312
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:31,007
A guy like me..
I know why you choose to have

313
00:26:31,609 --> 00:26:37,530
group therapy sessions in broad daylight.
I know why you're afraid to go out at night.

314
00:26:39,547 --> 00:26:46,459
The Batman. Batman has shown Gotham
your true colors, unfortunately.

315
00:26:46,816 --> 00:26:49,604
Dent, he's just the beginning.

316
00:26:50,922 --> 00:26:55,656
And as for the television's
so-called plan...

317
00:26:55,657 --> 00:27:00,585
The Batman has no jurisdiction.
He'll find him and make him squeal.

318
00:27:00,683 --> 00:27:03,696
I know the squealers when I see them.

319
00:27:06,489 --> 00:27:10,984
- What do you propose?
- It's simple. We kill the Batman.

320
00:27:11,885 --> 00:27:14,809
If it is so simple why
haven't you done it already?

321
00:27:15,011 --> 00:27:17,563
If you are good thing at something,
never do it for free.

322
00:27:18,057 --> 00:27:19,515
And what you want?

323
00:27:20,502 --> 00:27:22,555
Hm... Half.

324
00:27:24,002 --> 00:27:29,100
- Are you crazy!
- No I'm not... No, I'm not.

325
00:27:31,029 --> 00:27:38,850
If we don't deal with this now,
soon little Gamble here

326
00:27:38,851 --> 00:27:41,795
won't be able to get a
nickel for his grandma.

327
00:27:42,042 --> 00:27:44,263
Enough from the clown!

328
00:27:44,264 --> 00:27:49,266
Let's not blow this out of proportion.

329
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:52,254
Do you think you can
steal from us and just walk away?

330
00:27:52,289 --> 00:27:56,409
I'm putting a word out: 500 grand
for this clown dead.

331
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:59,758
A million alive, so I can
teach him some manners first.

332
00:28:00,463 --> 00:28:04,162
Alright, so listen.
Why don't you give me a call when

333
00:28:04,163 --> 00:28:09,958
you wanna start taking things
a little more seriously? Here's my card.

334
00:28:29,648 --> 00:28:32,986
You're a hard man to reach.

335
00:28:34,666 --> 00:28:36,757
Lau is halfway to Hong Kong.

336
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,266
If he had asked,
l could have taken his passport.

337
00:28:40,267 --> 00:28:41,764
I told you to keep me in the loop.

338
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:45,508
All that was left in the vaults were
marked bills. They knew we were coming.

339
00:28:45,509 --> 00:28:47,490
As soon as your office got involved...

340
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:48,569
My office?

341
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:51,868
You're sitting down there with scum like
Wuertz and Ramirez and you're talking...

342
00:28:52,746 --> 00:28:56,100
Oh yeah Gordon, I almost had your rookie
cold on a racketeering beef.

343
00:28:56,105 --> 00:28:59,628
Don't try and cloud the fact that clearly
Maroni's got people in your office, Dent.

344
00:29:03,689 --> 00:29:04,650
We need Lau back.

345
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:08,633
But the Chinese won't extradite
a National under any circumstances.

346
00:29:09,946 --> 00:29:12,870
If I get him to you,
can you get him to talk?

347
00:29:12,886 --> 00:29:14,289
I'll get him to sing.

348
00:29:14,299 --> 00:29:16,053
We're going after the mob's life savings.

349
00:29:17,026 --> 00:29:18,396
Things will get ugly...

350
00:29:18,768 --> 00:29:20,959
I knew the risk
when I took this job, lieutenant.

351
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:22,401
How will you get him back...

352
00:29:25,214 --> 00:29:26,572
He does that.

353
00:29:26,967 --> 00:29:30,320
Our Chinese friends left town before I
could tell them the deal was off.

354
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,333
Well I'm sure you've always
wanted to go to Hong Kong.

355
00:29:34,545 --> 00:29:35,491
What's wrong with a phone call?

356
00:29:36,742 --> 00:29:39,881
I think Mr Lau
deserves a more... personal touch.

357
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:46,055
Now for high altitude jumps, you're
gonna need oxygen and stabilizers.

358
00:29:53,238 --> 00:29:55,184
But what about getting back into the plane?

359
00:29:55,667 --> 00:29:57,397
I'd recommend a good travel agent.

360
00:29:57,407 --> 00:29:58,764
Without it landing.

361
00:30:00,469 --> 00:30:02,891
Now that's more like it, Mr. Wayne.

362
00:30:03,828 --> 00:30:09,530
The ClA had a program back in the 60's for getting
their people out of hot spots called skyhook

363
00:30:10,116 --> 00:30:14,452
You could look into that.
Okay, now.

364
00:30:15,796 --> 00:30:18,797
Hardened Kevlar plates over
titanium-tipped

365
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:21,284
triweaved fibers for flexibility.

366
00:30:21,531 --> 00:30:24,624
You'll be lighter,
faster, more agile.

367
00:30:27,789 --> 00:30:30,340
Perhaps you should read the instructions first.

368
00:30:30,832 --> 00:30:31,920
Now there is a tradeoff.

369
00:30:31,921 --> 00:30:35,810
Separation of the plates makes you
more vulnerable to knives and gunfire.

370
00:30:35,845 --> 00:30:38,151
We wouldn't want to make
things too easy now, would we?

371
00:30:38,877 --> 00:30:41,019
How will it hold up against dogs?

372
00:30:41,304 --> 00:30:43,707
We talking Rotweilers or Chiuauas?

373
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:46,524
It should do fine against cats.

374
00:30:47,061 --> 00:30:49,117
I found one in Arizona.

375
00:30:49,542 --> 00:30:53,649
An very nice man said he could have it up
and running in a week and he'd take the cash.

376
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,037
What about a flight crew?

377
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:59,501
South Korean smugglers; they run flights
into Pyongyang below radar the whole way.

378
00:30:59,502 --> 00:31:00,503
Did you think of an alibi?

379
00:31:00,677 --> 00:31:01,869
Oh, yes.

380
00:31:11,193 --> 00:31:14,884
Presentation cancelled

381
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:23,254
I believe this is your plane, sir!

382
00:31:27,308 --> 00:31:30,523
You look tired, Alfred.
Will you be all right without me?

383
00:31:32,737 --> 00:31:35,982
If you can tell me the Russian for:
Apply your own bloody suntan lotion.

384
00:31:47,185 --> 00:31:51,447
Yo Gamble, somebody here for you.
They say they've just killed the Joker.

385
00:31:51,687 --> 00:31:53,490
And they brought the body.

386
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,012
Dead, that's 500...

387
00:32:13,829 --> 00:32:15,726
How about alive?

388
00:32:19,214 --> 00:32:21,647
You want to know how I
got these scars?

389
00:32:23,836 --> 00:32:29,962
My father was a drinker and a fiend.

390
00:32:31,034 --> 00:32:35,039
One night he goes off
crazier than usual

391
00:32:35,449 --> 00:32:38,089
Mommy gets the kitchen knife
to defend herself.

392
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:43,006
He does not like that.
Not one bit.

393
00:32:44,012 --> 00:32:50,759
So, me watching, he takes the
knife to her, laughing while he does it.

394
00:32:51,408 --> 00:32:57,213
He turns to me and he says:
Why so serious, son?

395
00:32:58,516 --> 00:33:00,959
He comes at me with the knife...

396
00:33:01,026 --> 00:33:07,444
Why so serious, son? He sticks
the blade in my mouth:

397
00:33:08,188 --> 00:33:11,690
Let's put a smile on that face!

398
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,324
Why so serious?

399
00:33:24,322 --> 00:33:34,199
Now, our operation is small but there is a
lot of potential for aggressive expansion.

400
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,983
So, which of you fine gentleman
would like to join our team?

401
00:33:38,803 --> 00:33:40,602
There's only one spot open right now.

402
00:33:40,637 --> 00:33:44,766
So we're going to
have tryouts?

403
00:33:49,446 --> 00:33:51,033
Make it fast.

404
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:02,650
Welcome to Hong Kong, Mr. Fox.

405
00:34:02,651 --> 00:34:05,336
Mr Lau regrets he isn't able
to greet you in person today.

406
00:34:05,661 --> 00:34:06,948
I understand.

407
00:34:17,101 --> 00:34:20,475
For security purposes, I'm going to
have to ask you to check in your mobile.

408
00:34:21,109 --> 00:34:22,535
Of course

409
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:28,528
I must apologize for leaving
Gotham in the middle of our negotiations.

410
00:34:28,529 --> 00:34:32,418
This misunderstanding
with the Gotham police force.

411
00:34:32,791 --> 00:34:35,072
I couldn't let such a thing
threaten my company.

412
00:34:35,081 --> 00:34:35,787
Of course.

413
00:34:35,797 --> 00:34:38,078
A businessman of your stature
will understand

414
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,084
that with you here now,
we can continue.

415
00:34:43,255 --> 00:34:46,996
Well I do appreciate you bringing me
out here in such style Mr Lau...

416
00:34:48,428 --> 00:34:52,626
- We do not allow cell phones in here.
- Oh sorry, forgot I had it.

417
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:58,078
I really came to tell you that
our business deal has to be put on hold.

418
00:34:58,259 --> 00:35:04,956
We can't afford to be seen to do business
with... whatever it is you're accused of being.

419
00:35:04,962 --> 00:35:07,559
I'm sure a businessman of
your stature will understand.

420
00:35:07,774 --> 00:35:11,560
I think Mr Fox, a
simple phone call might have sufficed.

421
00:35:11,737 --> 00:35:13,071
Mr. Wayne didn't want
you to think that

422
00:35:13,072 --> 00:35:15,093
he was deliberately
wasting your time.

423
00:35:15,161 --> 00:35:17,038
Just accidentally wasting it.

424
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:21,780
That's very good Mr Lau.
Accidentally, very good.

425
00:35:22,545 --> 00:35:23,439
Hey, sir!

426
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,913
A better view from the train.

427
00:35:44,114 --> 00:35:50,084
- How's the view from LSl hallways?
- Restricted. Lau has held up the networking tight.

428
00:35:50,185 --> 00:35:52,365
- What is this?
- I had RND work it up.

429
00:35:52,366 --> 00:35:55,662
It sends out a high frequency pulse
records in response time.

430
00:35:55,663 --> 00:35:56,947
For mapping an environment.

431
00:35:57,101 --> 00:36:02,505
- Sonar, just like a...
- a submarine, Mr. Wayne.

432
00:36:02,506 --> 00:36:04,841
- And the other device?
- It's in place.

433
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:08,906
Mr Wayne, good luck.

434
00:37:48,151 --> 00:37:49,476
Where are the police?

435
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:50,446
They are coming.

436
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,398
Then what the hell
am I paying them for?

437
00:39:53,305 --> 00:39:54,830
Please deliver to Lieutenant Gordon.

438
00:39:59,065 --> 00:40:02,526
Look, give us the money
and we'll talk about making a deal.

439
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:05,584
The money is the only reason
l am still alive.

440
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:10,176
Oh, you mean when they find out
that you've helped us they're going to kill you?

441
00:40:10,177 --> 00:40:11,730
Are you threatening my client?

442
00:40:11,731 --> 00:40:15,508
No, I'm just assuming your
client's cooperation with this investigation.

443
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,439
As well everyone.

444
00:40:20,883 --> 00:40:23,787
No?
Okay.

445
00:40:24,903 --> 00:40:27,290
Enjoy your time in county Mr Lau.

446
00:40:27,977 --> 00:40:31,250
Wait.
I won't give you the money.

447
00:40:31,905 --> 00:40:34,971
But I will give you my clients.
All of them.

448
00:40:34,972 --> 00:40:41,501
You were a glorified accountant. What could you
possibly have on all of them that we could charge?

449
00:40:41,502 --> 00:40:45,327
I'm good with calculation.
I handled all the investments.

450
00:40:45,547 --> 00:40:46,860
One big pot.

451
00:40:48,693 --> 00:40:51,513
- Got it.
- One minute.

452
00:40:53,137 --> 00:40:57,802
If they pull their money we can
charge them all as one crew on conspiracy.

453
00:40:57,803 --> 00:40:58,804
Charge them with what?

454
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:02,551
In a Reiko case, if you can charge one
of the conspirators with a felony, you can...

455
00:41:02,552 --> 00:41:04,377
Charge all of them with it. That's great.

456
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:13,073
Mr Lau. What kind of details do you
have about this communal fund?

457
00:41:13,074 --> 00:41:13,942
Edgers, notebooks...

458
00:41:13,952 --> 00:41:16,686
Immunity, protection and a
chartered plane back to Hong Kong.

459
00:41:16,687 --> 00:41:18,355
After you testify in open court.

460
00:41:18,526 --> 00:41:21,611
And I'm just curious.
with all your clients locked up,

461
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:23,162
what's going to happen with all that money?

462
00:41:23,657 --> 00:41:26,946
Like I said, I am
good with calculation.

463
00:41:26,947 --> 00:41:31,735
He can't go to county,
I'll keep him here in the holding cells.

464
00:41:31,736 --> 00:41:33,522
What is this Gordon, your fortress?

465
00:41:34,432 --> 00:41:39,065
- Do you trust them over at county?
- I don't trust them here.

466
00:41:41,002 --> 00:41:42,383
Lau stays.

467
00:41:42,989 --> 00:41:47,159
Well, I don't know about Mr. Lau's travel
arrangements, but I'm sure glad he's back.

468
00:41:47,915 --> 00:41:50,365
He would, we should
have hired the clown.

469
00:41:52,957 --> 00:41:58,355
He was right, we have to
fix real problem. Batman.

470
00:42:03,012 --> 00:42:05,440
I'm not aware of any participation
by the Batman in the investigations.

471
00:42:05,441 --> 00:42:07,475
Our boy looks good on the tube

472
00:42:07,485 --> 00:42:10,321
You sure you want to embarrass me
in front of my friends lieutenant?

473
00:42:10,322 --> 00:42:13,248
No, don't worry.
They're coming too.

474
00:42:21,318 --> 00:42:23,049
Have a nice trip. See you in the next fall.

475
00:42:23,351 --> 00:42:27,509
712 counts of extortion,
849 counts of racketeering,

476
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:32,772
246 counts of fraud,
87 counts of conspiracy, murder...

477
00:42:34,058 --> 00:42:39,003
527 counts of obstruction of justice.
How do the defendants plead?

478
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,214
Order in court.

479
00:42:47,215 --> 00:42:52,333
549 criminals at once. How did you
convince Surrillo to hear this farce?

480
00:42:52,334 --> 00:42:56,882
She shares my enthusiasm
for justice. After all she is a Judge.

481
00:42:56,883 --> 00:43:00,008
Even if you blow enough smoke
to get convinctions out of Surrillo,

482
00:43:00,009 --> 00:43:02,858
you're going to set a new record
in appeals for quickest tick in the ass.

483
00:43:02,893 --> 00:43:07,253
It won't matter, the head guys make bail,
sure. But the midlevel guys, they can't.

484
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:10,679
They can't afford to be off
the streets long enough for trial and appeal,

485
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,255
they'll cut deals that include some jailtime.

486
00:43:12,362 --> 00:43:15,282
Think of all you can do
with 18 months of clean streets.

487
00:43:16,953 --> 00:43:18,101
Mr. Mayor, you can't...

488
00:43:18,102 --> 00:43:19,877
Get out, both of you.

489
00:43:24,309 --> 00:43:25,210
Sit down.

490
00:43:30,807 --> 00:43:33,879
The public likes you.
That's the only reason that this might fly.

491
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:38,099
But that means it's on you. They are all going
to come after you now and not just the mob.

492
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:44,704
Politicians, journalists, cops. Anyone
whose wallet is about to get lighter.

493
00:43:45,324 --> 00:43:49,817
Are you up to it? You better be,
because if they get anything on you

494
00:43:49,818 --> 00:43:54,853
and those criminals are back on the streets...
Followed swiftly by you and me.

495
00:44:17,158 --> 00:44:19,679
I think your fundraiser will
be a great success sir.

496
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,059
And why do you think I want to
hold a party for Harvey Dent?

497
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:25,433
Well, I assumed it was your
usual reason for socializing

498
00:44:25,434 --> 00:44:27,771
beyond myself and the scum
of Gotham's underbelly.

499
00:44:27,772 --> 00:44:29,666
To try to impress Miss Dawes.

500
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:34,840
Very droll, but very wrong.
Actually it's Dent.

501
00:44:34,841 --> 00:44:36,956
The police disclosed the footage
found at scene of the body.

502
00:44:36,957 --> 00:44:39,838
Sensitive viewers please be aware:
the image is disturbing.

503
00:44:40,039 --> 00:44:43,206
- Tell them your name.
- Brian.

504
00:44:45,377 --> 00:44:50,969
- Are you the real Batman?
- No! No!

505
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:53,618
Then why do you dress up like him?

506
00:44:58,345 --> 00:45:03,471
- He's a symbol... that we don't have to be afraid of scum like you!
- Yeah, you do, Brian. You really do!

507
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:11,926
So you think Batman has
made Gotham a better place?

508
00:45:19,937 --> 00:45:23,341
You see this is how crazy
Batman has made Gotham.

509
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:30,091
If you want to order in Gotham the Batman
must take off his mask and turn himself in!

510
00:45:30,847 --> 00:45:34,170
And every day he doesn't,
people will die!

511
00:45:34,719 --> 00:45:40,340
Starting tonight.
I'm a man of my word.

512
00:45:57,057 --> 00:46:03,497
Harvey Dent, scourge of the underworld,
scared stiff by the trust fund brigade.

513
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,902
- I'll be back.
- Rachel!

514
00:46:04,903 --> 00:46:07,001
A little liquid courage,
Mr Dent?

515
00:46:08,684 --> 00:46:10,589
- Alfred, right?
- That's right, sir.

516
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:13,742
Rachel talks about you all the time.
You've known her for her whole life?

517
00:46:13,743 --> 00:46:14,860
Not yet, sir.

518
00:46:17,547 --> 00:46:19,909
Any psychotic ex-boyfriends
l should be aware of?

519
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:21,730
Oh, you have no idea!

520
00:46:40,681 --> 00:46:44,848
I'm sorry that I'm late, but I'm glad
to see that you all got started without me.

521
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:51,332
Now, where is Harvey?
Where is Harvey Dent, the man of the hour!

522
00:46:51,333 --> 00:46:55,501
And where's Rachel Dawes,
she is my oldest friend. Come here.

523
00:46:55,502 --> 00:46:59,625
When Rachel first told me that she was
dating Harvey Dent, I had one thing to say:

524
00:46:59,626 --> 00:47:04,105
"The guy that was cut off from those awful campaign
commercials, I believe in Harvey Dent? "

525
00:47:04,106 --> 00:47:08,413
Yeah nice slogan, Harvey.
But you caught Rachel's attention.

526
00:47:08,414 --> 00:47:15,232
Then I started to pay attention to Harvey
and all that he's been doing as our new DA.

527
00:47:15,233 --> 00:47:20,579
And you know what?
I believe in Harvey Dent.

528
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:25,249
I believe that on his watch
Gotham can feel a little safer.

529
00:47:26,246 --> 00:47:28,713
A little more optimistic.

530
00:47:29,578 --> 00:47:33,996
Look at this face.
This is the face of Gotham's bright future.

531
00:47:33,997 --> 00:47:36,687
To Harvey Dent.
Let's hear it for him.

532
00:47:47,635 --> 00:47:51,120
Harvey may not know you well enough
to understand when you are making fun of him.

533
00:47:51,121 --> 00:47:51,939
But I do.

534
00:47:51,949 --> 00:47:53,338
No, I meant every word.

535
00:47:54,526 --> 00:47:59,794
You know that day that you once told me about
when Gotham would no longer need Batman?

536
00:47:59,868 --> 00:48:01,237
- It's coming.
- Bruce...

537
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:06,027
- You can't ask me to wait for that.
- It's happening now.

538
00:48:06,028 --> 00:48:07,828
Harvey is that hero.

539
00:48:07,829 --> 00:48:12,416
He locked up half of the city's criminals
and he did it without wearing a mask.

540
00:48:12,783 --> 00:48:15,527
Gotham needs a hero with a face.

541
00:48:16,204 --> 00:48:20,912
You throw a party Wayne, I'll give you that.
Thanks again.

542
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:23,985
You mind if I borrow Rachel?

543
00:48:28,526 --> 00:48:31,117
Lieutenant, that Joker card
pinned to the body?

544
00:48:31,118 --> 00:48:33,113
Forensics found 3 sets of DNA.

545
00:48:33,148 --> 00:48:34,563
- Any matches?
- All three.

546
00:48:34,564 --> 00:48:37,980
The DNA belongs to Judge Surrillo,
Harvey Dent, and Commissioner Loeb.

547
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:40,383
The Joker is telling us
who he's targeting.

548
00:48:40,384 --> 00:48:43,258
Get a unit over to Surrillo's house.
Tell Wuertz to find Dent.

549
00:48:43,259 --> 00:48:45,610
Get them both into protective custody.
Where's the commissioner?

550
00:48:45,611 --> 00:48:46,264
City Hall.

551
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,883
Seal the building.
No one in or out until I get there.

552
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:49,485
Got it.

553
00:49:01,746 --> 00:49:04,965
- Gordon! What are you up to?
- We're secure.

554
00:49:04,966 --> 00:49:07,466
I want a floor by floor
search of the entire building.

555
00:49:07,467 --> 00:49:10,026
Sorry sir, we believe the Joker
has made a threat against your life.

556
00:49:10,261 --> 00:49:11,733
These are dangerous people, Judge.

557
00:49:11,734 --> 00:49:13,856
Yes, but you're not
giving me an awful lot of information.

558
00:49:13,891 --> 00:49:16,553
- Even we don't know where you're going.
- Take the envelope.

559
00:49:16,554 --> 00:49:18,969
Get in, open it. It'll tell
you where you're headed.

560
00:49:23,037 --> 00:49:24,876
You can not leave me alone
with these people.

561
00:49:24,935 --> 00:49:28,106
The whole mob is after you
and you're worried about these guys?

562
00:49:28,107 --> 00:49:30,197
Compared to this,
the mob doesn't scare me.

563
00:49:30,398 --> 00:49:33,646
Gordon, you're unlikely
to discover this for yourself, so..

564
00:49:34,196 --> 00:49:38,438
Take my word, the Police Commissioner
there's a lot of threats.

565
00:49:38,439 --> 00:49:43,443
I found the appropriate response
to these situations a long time ago.

566
00:49:44,177 --> 00:49:46,391
Them gunning for you
makes you see things clearly.

567
00:49:46,392 --> 00:49:47,467
Yeah, I bet.

568
00:49:47,468 --> 00:49:51,741
Yeah, it makes you think
about things you couldn't stand losing.

569
00:49:52,728 --> 00:49:54,603
About who you want to
spend the rest of your life with.

570
00:49:54,604 --> 00:49:55,906
It's a pretty big commitment.

571
00:49:56,050 --> 00:49:57,487
Well, not if the Mob has their way.

572
00:50:02,758 --> 00:50:07,963
It'd be good to explain to my wife
why I'm late for dinner tonight.

573
00:50:07,964 --> 00:50:10,792
Sir, the Joker card
had traces of your DNA on it.

574
00:50:12,728 --> 00:50:17,450
- Don't do that.
- Alright. Let's be serious then.

575
00:50:18,008 --> 00:50:20,732
- Okay.
- What's your answer?

576
00:50:26,423 --> 00:50:28,737
I don't have an answer.

577
00:50:30,144 --> 00:50:31,529
How'd they get my DNA?

578
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:33,367
Somebody with access to your
office or your house

579
00:50:33,368 --> 00:50:35,590
must have lifted a tissue
or a glass...

580
00:50:35,625 --> 00:50:36,421
Wait!

581
00:50:36,754 --> 00:50:38,967
- I guess the answer is no.
- Harvey...

582
00:50:39,447 --> 00:50:41,441
- It's someone else, isn't it?
- Harvey!

583
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:44,321
Just tell me it's not Wayne,
the guy's a complete…

584
00:50:45,432 --> 00:50:47,168
What are you doing?

585
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:07,107
Get a medic!

586
00:51:13,108 --> 00:51:14,216
We made it!

587
00:51:20,133 --> 00:51:23,434
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

588
00:51:26,228 --> 00:51:29,403
We are tonight's entertainment!

589
00:51:31,102 --> 00:51:32,577
I only have one question.

590
00:51:33,545 --> 00:51:36,311
Where is Harvey Dent?

591
00:51:46,549 --> 00:51:48,863
You know where Harvey is?
You know who he is?

592
00:51:48,873 --> 00:51:50,500
Hands up, pretty boy!

593
00:51:57,045 --> 00:51:58,718
Do you know where I can find Harvey?

594
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:01,421
I need to talk to him about something,
something little.

595
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:03,024
No...

596
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:07,456
- What's going on out there?
- Wayne!

597
00:52:09,704 --> 00:52:11,902
Ah, thank God you've
got a panic room. Wait!

598
00:52:12,718 --> 00:52:14,446
You got to be kidding me.

599
00:52:14,775 --> 00:52:19,971
- You know, I'll settle for his loved ones.
- We're not intimidated by thugs!

600
00:52:21,381 --> 00:52:26,938
You know, you remind me of my father.

601
00:52:28,233 --> 00:52:31,811
- I hated my father!
- Okay stop!

602
00:52:36,147 --> 00:52:43,580
Well, hello beautiful!
You must be Harvey's squeeze!

603
00:52:45,333 --> 00:52:47,259
And you are beautiful.

604
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:57,791
You look nervous.
Is it the scars?

605
00:52:59,542 --> 00:53:01,206
You want to know how I got them?

606
00:53:02,617 --> 00:53:04,831
Come here.
Hey!

607
00:53:05,687 --> 00:53:07,199
Look at me.

608
00:53:07,953 --> 00:53:11,936
So I had a wife, beautiful, like you,

609
00:53:12,878 --> 00:53:19,768
who tells me I worry too much.
Who tells me I ought to smile more.

610
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:25,185
Who gambles and gets in deep with the sharks

611
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:31,005
One day, they carve her face.
And we have no money for surgeries.

612
00:53:31,006 --> 00:53:35,950
She can't take it.
I just want to see her smile again, hmm?

613
00:53:37,446 --> 00:53:40,457
I just want her to know
that I don't care about the scars.

614
00:53:40,772 --> 00:53:48,546
So... I stick a razor in my mouth
and do this... to myself

615
00:53:48,939 --> 00:53:55,923
And you know what?
She can't stand the sight of me! She leaves.

616
00:53:56,358 --> 00:54:01,777
Now I see the funny side.
Now I'm always smiling!

617
00:54:04,847 --> 00:54:08,321
A little fight in you.
I like that.

618
00:54:08,322 --> 00:54:09,596
Then you're going to love me.

619
00:54:38,627 --> 00:54:41,182
- Drop the gun.
- Oh, sure!

620
00:54:41,183 --> 00:54:44,539
You just take off your little
mask and show us all who you really are.

621
00:54:50,626 --> 00:54:54,644
- Let her go.
- Very poor choice of words!

622
00:55:16,408 --> 00:55:18,003
Are you alright?

623
00:55:20,883 --> 00:55:22,429
Let's not do that again...

624
00:55:23,565 --> 00:55:25,645
- Is Harvey okay?
- He's safe.

625
00:55:27,291 --> 00:55:28,354
Thank you

626
00:55:29,077 --> 00:55:30,197
Jim, it's over!

627
00:55:30,332 --> 00:55:33,122
As long as they don't get to Lau,
we've cut off their funds.

628
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:34,678
But the prosecution is over!

629
00:55:34,679 --> 00:55:39,230
Nobody's standing up in front of a judge while judges
and police commissioners are getting blown away.

630
00:55:39,693 --> 00:55:40,731
What about Dent?

631
00:55:40,933 --> 00:55:42,598
If he's got any sense,
Dent's halfway to Mexico.

632
00:55:43,184 --> 00:55:44,658
So where do you keep your trash?

633
00:55:45,938 --> 00:55:47,039
You're due at court.

634
00:55:47,975 --> 00:55:49,531
I need you alive long enough
to get you under record.

635
00:55:50,044 --> 00:55:52,909
You can't protect me.
You can't even protect yourselves.

636
00:55:52,945 --> 00:55:55,915
If you refuse to cooperate you're
not coming back here, you go to county.

637
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:58,574
How long you calculate
you'll last in there?

638
00:56:00,341 --> 00:56:02,407
Targeting me won't get
their money back.

639
00:56:02,408 --> 00:56:05,311
I knew the mob wouldn't go down
without a fight, but this is different.

640
00:56:05,332 --> 00:56:07,653
- They've crossed the line.
- You've crossed the line first, sir

641
00:56:07,654 --> 00:56:11,013
You squeezed them, you hammered
them to the point of desperation.

642
00:56:11,673 --> 00:56:15,816
In their desperation, they turned to
a man they didn't fully understand.

643
00:56:17,575 --> 00:56:19,371
Criminals aren't complicated Alfred.

644
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:22,106
We just need to figure out what he's after.

645
00:56:22,107 --> 00:56:26,909
With respect, master Wayne, perhaps this
is a man you don't fully understand either.

646
00:56:27,456 --> 00:56:30,767
A long time ago I was in Burma.

647
00:56:30,768 --> 00:56:34,062
My friends and I were working
for the local government.

648
00:56:34,188 --> 00:56:36,728
They were trying to buy the
loyalty of tribal leaders by

649
00:56:36,729 --> 00:56:39,287
bribing them with precious stones.

650
00:56:39,778 --> 00:56:44,427
But their caravans were being raided
in a forest north of Yangoon by a bandit.

651
00:56:44,428 --> 00:56:46,833
So, we went looking for the stones.

652
00:56:48,152 --> 00:56:53,565
But in 6 months we never met
anyone who traded with him.

653
00:56:53,953 --> 00:57:00,534
One day, I saw a child playing with
a ruby the size of a tangerine.

654
00:57:01,441 --> 00:57:06,483
- The bandit had been throwing them away.
- So why steal them?

655
00:57:06,484 --> 00:57:08,531
Well, because he thought
it was good sport.

656
00:57:08,532 --> 00:57:12,905
Because some men aren't looking
for anything logical, like money.

657
00:57:13,295 --> 00:57:18,065
They can't be bought, bullied,
reasoned, or negotiated with.

658
00:57:18,066 --> 00:57:21,852
Some men just want
to watch the world burn.

659
00:57:59,844 --> 00:58:01,396
Get the names.

660
00:58:07,738 --> 00:58:13,097
- Richard Dent
- Patrick Harvey

661
00:58:13,411 --> 00:58:14,379
Harvey Dent.

662
00:58:14,547 --> 00:58:17,421
I need 10 minutes with the scene
before your men contaminate it.

663
00:58:17,557 --> 00:58:19,893
Us contaminate it? It's because
of you these guys are dead...

664
00:58:19,894 --> 00:58:20,895
Detective!

665
00:58:23,338 --> 00:58:25,475
Just a minute guys.

666
00:58:27,051 --> 00:58:28,799
It's brick underneath.

667
00:58:29,152 --> 00:58:30,916
You going to take ballistics
off a shattered bullet?

668
00:58:30,917 --> 00:58:35,676
No.
Fingerprints.

669
00:58:42,304 --> 00:58:44,003
Obituaries.
Mayor Anthony Garcia.

670
00:58:44,004 --> 00:58:46,192
Whatever you're going to do,
do it fast.

671
00:58:48,123 --> 00:58:52,754
Because we found his next target.
He's put it in tomorrow's paper.

672
00:59:10,036 --> 00:59:12,149
I'm not sure you
made it loud enough, sir.

673
00:59:25,348 --> 00:59:26,730
What can I do for you Mr Reese?

674
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:30,264
You wanted me to do the
diligence on the LSl holdings deal again.

675
00:59:32,099 --> 00:59:36,881
- Well, I found some irregularities.
- Our CEO is in police custody.

676
00:59:36,882 --> 00:59:39,776
No, not with their numbers
With yours.

677
00:59:40,172 --> 00:59:41,217
Applied sciences.

678
00:59:41,218 --> 00:59:45,305
A whole division of Wayne
Enterprises just disappeared, overnight.

679
00:59:45,306 --> 00:59:48,897
I went down to the archives and
l started pulling some old files.

680
00:59:50,395 --> 00:59:52,325
Don't tell me you didn't
recognize your baby out there

681
00:59:52,326 --> 00:59:55,047
pancaking cop cars on the evening news.

682
00:59:56,434 --> 01:00:00,500
Now you got the entire RND
department burning through cash

683
01:00:00,501 --> 01:00:03,242
claiming it's related
to cellphones for the army?

684
01:00:03,243 --> 01:00:06,897
What are you building for
him now, a rocket ship?

685
01:00:08,749 --> 01:00:14,272
I want 10 million dollars
a year for the rest of my life.

686
01:00:16,876 --> 01:00:18,896
Let me get this straight.

687
01:00:20,572 --> 01:00:26,415
You think that your client, one of the
wealthiest, most powerful men in the world

688
01:00:26,416 --> 01:00:30,952
is secretly a vigilante, who spends his
nights beating criminals to a pulp...

689
01:00:30,953 --> 01:00:36,343
... with his bare hands.
And your plan is to blackmail this person?

690
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:44,792
Good luck.

691
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:51,576
Keep that.

692
01:00:58,733 --> 01:01:00,639
This is your original scan.

693
01:01:02,505 --> 01:01:04,368
Here it is re-engineered.

694
01:01:13,095 --> 01:01:15,859
And there's the thumbprint he left when
he pushed the round in the clip.

695
01:01:18,301 --> 01:01:19,795
I'll get you a copy.

696
01:01:19,973 --> 01:01:24,343
Mr. Wayne, did you reassign RND?

697
01:01:24,344 --> 01:01:26,381
Yes, government
telecommunications project.

698
01:01:26,382 --> 01:01:28,505
I wasn't aware we had any
government contracts.

699
01:01:28,774 --> 01:01:31,867
Lucius, I'm playing
this one pretty close to the chest.

700
01:01:32,869 --> 01:01:34,384
Fair enough.

701
01:01:37,888 --> 01:01:41,075
With no word from the Batman.
Even as they mourn Commissioner Loeb.

702
01:01:41,076 --> 01:01:44,149
These cops have to be wondering
if the Joker will make good on

703
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:47,354
his threat in the obituary column of
the Gotham Times to kill the mayor.

704
01:01:49,736 --> 01:01:53,620
I've checked all the databases.
There are four possibles.

705
01:01:53,621 --> 01:01:59,691
Cross reference the addresses. Look
for Park Side, overlooking the parade.

706
01:02:01,342 --> 01:02:06,609
I got one! Melvin White,
1502 Randalf Apartments

707
01:02:06,804 --> 01:02:10,479
Aggravated his soul,
moved to Arkham twice.

708
01:02:49,686 --> 01:02:50,998
How many you got on the roof?

709
01:02:51,475 --> 01:02:54,352
We're tight but frankly
there's a lot of windows up here!

710
01:03:03,443 --> 01:03:06,926
Commissioner Loeb
dedicated his life to

711
01:03:06,927 --> 01:03:09,913
law enforcement and to
the protection of his community.

712
01:03:10,148 --> 01:03:11,907
I remember when I first took office,

713
01:03:11,908 --> 01:03:14,269
I asked him if
he wanted to stay on as Commissioner and...

714
01:03:23,631 --> 01:03:27,009
Clearly he was not a man who minced
words nor should he have been

715
01:03:28,404 --> 01:03:32,316
A number of policies that
he enacted were unpopular.

716
01:03:32,317 --> 01:03:35,426
Policies that flooded
my office with angry calls and letter...

717
01:03:39,827 --> 01:03:41,497
- Who is it?
- What happened?

718
01:03:42,514 --> 01:03:46,563
They took our guns and uniforms.

719
01:03:55,634 --> 01:03:59,740
We must remember that vigilance
is the price of safety.

720
01:04:00,075 --> 01:04:03,281
Standby, Honor, Guard, Atten-hut.

721
01:04:07,162 --> 01:04:08,684
Ready

722
01:04:08,685 --> 01:04:09,775
Aim

723
01:04:10,363 --> 01:04:11,857
Fire!

724
01:04:12,865 --> 01:04:15,627
Ready, aim...

725
01:04:17,816 --> 01:04:20,577
Ready, aim...

726
01:04:32,017 --> 01:04:33,289
Get him out!

727
01:04:42,590 --> 01:04:44,371
- I'll see you later!
- Why are you coming back?

728
01:04:57,011 --> 01:04:58,240
Get out!

729
01:05:02,696 --> 01:05:04,938
Tell me what you
know about the Joker.

730
01:05:35,536 --> 01:05:38,861
- No!
- I'm sorry Barbara.

731
01:05:39,247 --> 01:05:42,267
Junior, go play with
your sister, go ahead.

732
01:05:43,216 --> 01:05:47,300
If there is anything that
l can do, we're here for you.

733
01:05:51,306 --> 01:05:58,413
Are you happy.. Are you
You brought this craziness on us... You did!

734
01:06:01,303 --> 01:06:05,373
Switch it off, he ain't coming.
He doesn't want to talk to us.

735
01:06:06,484 --> 01:06:09,166
May God help whoever
he does want to talk to.

736
01:06:10,268 --> 01:06:13,116
Can we go some place quieter?
We can't hear each other talk.

737
01:06:13,565 --> 01:06:16,414
Why makes you think
l want to hear you talk?

738
01:06:16,790 --> 01:06:17,508
What?

739
01:06:50,488 --> 01:06:52,857
- Harvey, where are you?
- Where are you?

740
01:06:52,858 --> 01:06:56,397
I'm where you should be at MCU
I'm trying to deal with all this mess.

741
01:06:56,398 --> 01:06:57,599
Can I get the fingerprint analysis?

742
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:00,432
Rachel, listen to me.
You're not safe there.

743
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:02,689
- Oh, this is Gordon's unit.
- Gordon's gone, Rachel.

744
01:07:02,690 --> 01:07:05,400
- He vouched for these men.
- And he's gone.

745
01:07:10,583 --> 01:07:12,902
The Joker has named you next.

746
01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:15,886
Is there anyone in this
town we can trust?

747
01:07:16,138 --> 01:07:19,367
Bruce.
We can trust Bruce Wayne.

748
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:21,376
No Rachel, I know
you're his friend but...

749
01:07:21,377 --> 01:07:22,378
Harvey, Trust me.

750
01:07:23,196 --> 01:07:26,296
Bruce's penthouse is now
the safest place in the city.

751
01:07:26,297 --> 01:07:30,015
Then you go straight there. Don't tell
anybody where you're going. I'll find you there.

752
01:07:30,016 --> 01:07:31,217
I love you.

753
01:07:45,523 --> 01:07:46,981
I want the Joker.

754
01:07:48,155 --> 01:07:52,588
From one professional to another, if you're
trying to scare somebody, pick a better spot.

755
01:07:52,589 --> 01:07:55,194
From this height, the fall wouldn't kill me.

756
01:07:55,195 --> 01:07:56,346
I'm counting on it.

757
01:08:04,324 --> 01:08:05,240
Where is he?

758
01:08:05,241 --> 01:08:07,541
I don't know where he is.
He found us.

759
01:08:07,542 --> 01:08:11,482
- He must have friends.
- Friends? Have you met this guy?

760
01:08:11,483 --> 01:08:15,755
- Someone knows where he is!
- Nobody's going to tell you nothing.

761
01:08:15,756 --> 01:08:20,019
He was right.
You got rules. The Joker...

762
01:08:20,020 --> 01:08:23,885
He's got no rules.
Nobody's going to cross him for you.

763
01:08:23,886 --> 01:08:28,244
If you want this guy, you got one way.
But you already know what that is.

764
01:08:28,245 --> 01:08:31,781
Just take off that mask
let him come find you.

765
01:08:33,244 --> 01:08:36,927
Or are you going to let a couple more
people get killed while you make up your mind.

766
01:08:38,632 --> 01:08:40,234
You want to play games?

767
01:08:47,376 --> 01:08:48,529
How's that feel?

768
01:08:48,530 --> 01:08:50,473
- Don't kill...
- I wouldn't?

769
01:08:52,497 --> 01:08:55,450
You don't think I will?
You don't think I will?

770
01:08:57,488 --> 01:09:00,321
No, I wouldn't.

771
01:09:01,829 --> 01:09:03,926
That's why I'm not going
to leave it up to me.

772
01:09:05,484 --> 01:09:12,713
Heads, you get to keep your head.
Tails, not so lucky.

773
01:09:12,714 --> 01:09:15,504
So, you want to tell me about the Joker?

774
01:09:25,757 --> 01:09:29,484
- Let's go again.
- I don't know anything, I don't!

775
01:09:29,801 --> 01:09:34,333
You're not playing the odds, friend.
Let's do it again.

776
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:41,737
- You'd leave a man's life to chance?
- Not exactly.

777
01:09:41,738 --> 01:09:44,007
His name is Shif, Thomas.

778
01:09:44,008 --> 01:09:47,985
He's a paranoid schizophrenic,
former patient at Arkham.

779
01:09:47,986 --> 01:09:49,687
The kind of mind
that Joker attracts.

780
01:09:50,188 --> 01:09:52,124
What do you expect to learn from him?

781
01:09:56,045 --> 01:09:58,934
The Joker killed Gordon.
He's going to kill Rachel!

782
01:09:58,935 --> 01:10:01,631
You are the symbol of hope
l could never be.

783
01:10:01,832 --> 01:10:04,510
Your stand against organized
crime is the first

784
01:10:04,511 --> 01:10:07,259
legitimate ray of light in
Gotham in decades.

785
01:10:07,294 --> 01:10:10,307
If anyone saw this,
everything would be undone.

786
01:10:11,183 --> 01:10:13,285
All the criminals you pulled off
the streets would be released

787
01:10:13,286 --> 01:10:15,748
and Jim Gordon will have died for nothing.

788
01:10:17,339 --> 01:10:20,382
- You're going to hold a press
conference tomorrow morning.
- Why?

789
01:10:20,383 --> 01:10:23,806
No one else will die because of me.
Gotham is in your hands now.

790
01:10:24,614 --> 01:10:28,076
You can't.
You can't give in.

791
01:10:28,077 --> 01:10:29,078
You can't give in!

792
01:10:46,104 --> 01:10:50,291
Harvey called.
He said Batman's going to turn himself in.

793
01:10:50,776 --> 01:10:51,742
I have no choice.

794
01:10:51,743 --> 01:10:55,335
Do you honestly think that's going to
keep the Joker from killing people?

795
01:10:55,336 --> 01:10:58,047
Maybe not, but I have
enough blood on my hands.

796
01:10:59,155 --> 01:11:03,747
I have seen now what I would have to
become to stop a man like him.

797
01:11:04,661 --> 01:11:07,298
You once told me that if
the day came when I...

798
01:11:07,299 --> 01:11:09,180
was finished, then we would be together.

799
01:11:10,875 --> 01:11:13,928
Bruce, don't make me your
one hope for a normal life.

800
01:11:15,555 --> 01:11:16,818
Did you mean it?

801
01:11:18,365 --> 01:11:19,649
Yes.

802
01:11:39,818 --> 01:11:43,773
If you turn yourself in, they're
not going to let us be together.

803
01:11:55,236 --> 01:11:58,136
- Logs as well?
- Everything.

804
01:11:58,137 --> 01:12:01,304
Anything that can
lead back to Lucius or Rachel.

805
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:10,354
People are dying Alfred.
What would you have me do?

806
01:12:10,455 --> 01:12:15,749
- Endure... master Wayne.
- Take it.... They'll hate you for it.

807
01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:20,056
But that's the point of Batman,
he can be the outcast.

808
01:12:20,057 --> 01:12:25,272
He can make the choice that
no one else can make, the right choice.

809
01:12:25,672 --> 01:12:30,176
Well today I found out what Batman can't do.
He can't endure this.

810
01:12:30,177 --> 01:12:32,780
Today you get to say
"I told you so."

811
01:12:33,882 --> 01:12:36,671
Today, I don't want to.

812
01:12:42,995 --> 01:12:44,784
But I did bloody tell you.

813
01:12:47,498 --> 01:12:52,630
I suppose they'll lock me up as well.
As your accomplice...

814
01:12:52,631 --> 01:12:56,357
Accomplice? I'm going to tell them
the whole thing was your idea.

815
01:13:01,664 --> 01:13:03,117
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Thank you for coming.

816
01:13:03,118 --> 01:13:05,376
I've called this
press conference for two reasons.

817
01:13:05,377 --> 01:13:07,840
Firstly, to assure
the citizens of Gotham that

818
01:13:07,841 --> 01:13:11,350
everything that can be done over
the Joker killings is being done.

819
01:13:12,228 --> 01:13:15,033
Secondly, because the Batman
has offered to turn himself in.

820
01:13:15,732 --> 01:13:17,386
But first, let's consider the situation.

821
01:13:17,387 --> 01:13:19,641
Should we give into
this terrorist's demands?

822
01:13:20,654 --> 01:13:23,641
- Do we really think that...
- Would you rather protect an outlaw vigilante

823
01:13:23,642 --> 01:13:25,692
... than the lives of citizens?

824
01:13:25,693 --> 01:13:27,200
The Batman is an outlaw.

825
01:13:29,099 --> 01:13:31,027
But that's not why
we're demanding he turn himself in.

826
01:13:31,062 --> 01:13:32,511
We're doing it because we're scared.

827
01:13:32,713 --> 01:13:35,515
We've been happy to let the Batman
clean up our streets for us until now.

828
01:13:35,516 --> 01:13:37,626
Things are worse than ever!

829
01:13:40,101 --> 01:13:41,405
Yes they are...

830
01:13:44,415 --> 01:13:47,016
But the night is darkest
just before the dawn.

831
01:13:50,172 --> 01:13:54,228
And I promise you...
the dawn is coming.

832
01:13:54,329 --> 01:13:57,532
One day, the Batman will have to
answer for the laws he's broken.

833
01:13:57,533 --> 01:14:00,485
But to us, not to this madman!

834
01:14:01,108 --> 01:14:02,652
No more dead cops!

835
01:14:06,570 --> 01:14:08,695
He should turn himself in!

836
01:14:14,469 --> 01:14:16,704
So be it.
Take the Batman into custody.

837
01:14:20,005 --> 01:14:21,217
I am the Batman.

838
01:14:32,089 --> 01:14:33,388
Alfred!

839
01:14:35,162 --> 01:14:37,396
Why is he letting Harvey do this?

840
01:14:37,468 --> 01:14:40,235
- He went down to the press conference.
- I know, and he just stoodby!

841
01:14:40,274 --> 01:14:43,576
Perhaps both Bruce and
Mr. Dent believe the Batman

842
01:14:43,614 --> 01:14:47,420
stands for something more important than
the whims of a terrorist, Ms. Dawes.

843
01:14:48,157 --> 01:14:50,185
Even if everyone hates him for it.

844
01:14:50,596 --> 01:14:52,589
That's a sacrifice he's making.

845
01:14:53,002 --> 01:14:56,738
He's not being a hero.
He is being something more.

846
01:14:56,810 --> 01:15:01,616
Yeah, you're absolutely right. Letting Harvey
take the fall for this is not heroic at all.

847
01:15:04,427 --> 01:15:07,866
- You know him better than anyone.
- I do.

848
01:15:10,572 --> 01:15:14,571
Will you give this to him for me?
When the time is right.

849
01:15:15,083 --> 01:15:18,386
- How will I know?
- It's not sealed.

850
01:15:19,893 --> 01:15:21,329
- Bye Alfred.

851
01:15:24,905 --> 01:15:26,498
- Goodbye Rachel.

852
01:15:35,127 --> 01:15:37,393
Sorry, I didn't have time
to talk this through with you...

853
01:15:37,431 --> 01:15:38,457
What are you doing?

854
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:40,128
They're transferring me
to Central holding.

855
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:43,868
This is the Joker's chance. And when
he attacks, the Batman will take him down.

856
01:15:43,946 --> 01:15:46,213
Listen to me, this is too dangerous!

857
01:15:46,251 --> 01:15:48,347
We get this guy to county,
he's their problem.

858
01:15:48,390 --> 01:15:50,383
The streets will be cleared
along your route. Let's go!

859
01:15:50,494 --> 01:15:53,466
Lieutenant, the convoy stops for no reason!

860
01:15:54,169 --> 01:15:55,503
I hope you got some moves pal.

861
01:15:55,504 --> 01:15:58,657
He's using you as bait. He doesn't
even know if he can get the Joker.

862
01:15:58,658 --> 01:16:01,260
- He's failed so far.
- How do you know what he's looking for?

863
01:16:01,261 --> 01:16:02,262
I just, I do!

864
01:16:02,562 --> 01:16:04,317
Anyway Harvey,
this isn't just about you.

865
01:16:04,318 --> 01:16:08,434
What about all the people who are depending on
you to clean the city up and to do it honorably?

866
01:16:14,852 --> 01:16:17,917
Harvey, tell everyone the truth.

867
01:16:17,918 --> 01:16:19,283
Heads, I go through with it.

868
01:16:19,961 --> 01:16:23,897
This is your life! You can't leave
something like that to chance.

869
01:16:24,444 --> 01:16:25,400
I'm not.

870
01:16:28,508 --> 01:16:30,649
You make your own luck.

871
01:16:53,519 --> 01:16:55,231
Hey! You wait like
everyone else, pal.

872
01:17:03,122 --> 01:17:07,281
What the hell is that?
Obstruction ahead! Obstruction ahead!

873
01:17:07,977 --> 01:17:11,730
Damn it! All units, divert down onto
lower 5th. I repeat, exit down.

874
01:17:11,731 --> 01:17:15,481
- Exit down!
- Lower 5th? We'll be like
turkeys on Thanksgiving down there.

875
01:17:48,815 --> 01:17:50,355
Come on. Get us out of here.
Let's go

876
01:17:52,476 --> 01:17:54,765
Listen, we need backup.
We've got company.

877
01:17:54,766 --> 01:17:55,940
We got trouble, guys.

878
01:17:59,207 --> 01:18:00,169
Lock and load!

879
01:18:11,469 --> 01:18:12,753
What the hell was that?

880
01:18:34,941 --> 01:18:36,444
These things were
built for that, right?

881
01:18:36,445 --> 01:18:38,505
He's going to need something
a lot bigger to get through this.

882
01:18:40,667 --> 01:18:41,302
What is that?

883
01:18:43,175 --> 01:18:44,456
What is that? A bazooka!

884
01:18:53,131 --> 01:18:54,425
I didn't sign up for this!

885
01:19:11,228 --> 01:19:11,973
Look out.

886
01:19:13,332 --> 01:19:13,886
Down!

887
01:19:37,050 --> 01:19:38,219
Come on! Let's go!

888
01:20:24,664 --> 01:20:30,038
Harvey, Harvey, Harvey Dent!
Excuse me, I want to drive.

889
01:20:34,643 --> 01:20:38,022
Scanning all systems.
Scanning all systems.

890
01:20:45,670 --> 01:20:48,086
We got to get topside.
We need air support now.

891
01:20:53,464 --> 01:20:55,452
I like this job! I like it!

892
01:20:57,501 --> 01:21:00,640
Damage catastrophic.
Eject sequence initiated.

893
01:21:14,203 --> 01:21:14,934
Goodbye.

894
01:21:24,964 --> 01:21:27,191
We're on point! Ready to give them
some of their own medicine.

895
01:21:34,406 --> 01:21:36,679
That's what I'm talking about.
Aircabs.

896
01:21:50,539 --> 01:21:53,771
Okay! Rack 'em up, rack 'em up,
rack 'em up!

897
01:22:15,464 --> 01:22:16,373
That's not good.

898
01:22:20,203 --> 01:22:21,389
Okay, That's not good!
