1
00:00:49,461 --> 00:00:53,989
Good morning, Lula. This is the
Reverend Beverly H. Hooker.

2
00:00:57,102 --> 00:00:59,297
Temperatures up around 99.

3
00:00:59,805 --> 00:01:04,469
Now let's get things started
with the Heaven on a Hookup cycle.

4
00:01:50,889 --> 00:01:54,552
Bud, we got a letter
from your sister this morning.

5
00:01:55,027 --> 00:01:57,393
- I ain't reading it.
- Fine.

6
00:01:57,663 --> 00:01:59,824
- I'll read it.
- I ain't listening.

7
00:02:00,065 --> 00:02:03,865
That's fiine too.
You don't even have to listen.

8
00:02:04,136 --> 00:02:06,570
"Dear brother and Raynelle:

9
00:02:06,805 --> 00:02:10,536
I was expecting
to see you at services Sunday...

10
00:02:10,809 --> 00:02:15,212
...but I guess there was
something good on TV. Again.

11
00:02:15,514 --> 00:02:19,575
- I know you love that wrestling."
- Damn straight.

12
00:02:19,851 --> 00:02:24,345
"I wonder if they'll
have TVin hell.

13
00:02:24,589 --> 00:02:27,990
I heard Junior's business
went belly-up.

14
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,194
When will your son learn?"

15
00:02:30,395 --> 00:02:34,331
She should talk. One in the pen,
another on the way.

16
00:02:34,533 --> 00:02:39,664
"I think both our sons could learn
something from Buster's boy.

17
00:02:40,405 --> 00:02:43,897
Saturday he mowed the front yard...

18
00:02:44,176 --> 00:02:49,273
...the side yard and them
three acres behind the house.

19
00:02:49,581 --> 00:02:51,947
His birthday is coming up...

20
00:02:52,217 --> 00:02:56,847
...so I gave him three dollars
instead of the usual two.

21
00:02:57,055 --> 00:02:59,853
That's about all the news for now.

22
00:03:00,058 --> 00:03:03,289
I'm coming over
Sunday after services.

23
00:03:03,562 --> 00:03:06,258
One of you, Bud...

24
00:03:06,531 --> 00:03:08,362
...needs to get right with the Lord.

25
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,932
And I'm the lady for the job.

26
00:03:11,136 --> 00:03:14,572
We're gonna spend the whole
day singing...

27
00:03:14,773 --> 00:03:17,936
...and praying until
we wear you down.

28
00:03:18,243 --> 00:03:20,734
Like it says in 2 Peter 3:8:

29
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:25,075
'One day is with the Lord
as a thousand years.'

30
00:03:25,317 --> 00:03:28,115
Your loving sister, Marguerite."

31
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:32,779
Well, Bud.
What did you think of that?

32
00:03:39,564 --> 00:03:41,054
Bud?

33
00:04:03,455 --> 00:04:05,116
Aw, hell no.

34
00:04:06,424 --> 00:04:09,188
Oh, you're not getting off
that easy.

35
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,929
- Good God, Mama!
- Did you take the Lord's name in vain?

36
00:04:19,137 --> 00:04:22,538
- What the hell do you want?
- Don't talk filth!

37
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:25,105
Are you still in bed?

38
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:28,507
Why aren't you looking for a job?

39
00:04:28,713 --> 00:04:31,773
Because it's 7:00 in the morning!

40
00:04:31,983 --> 00:04:36,215
You wouldn't happen
to be suffering from a hangover?

41
00:04:36,488 --> 00:04:39,685
Are you laid up there
with some harlot?

42
00:04:41,893 --> 00:04:45,852
Wake up, harlot! What time is it?
You hear me?

43
00:04:46,064 --> 00:04:48,794
Mama, what do you want?

44
00:04:49,134 --> 00:04:51,967
I just thought you should know...

45
00:04:52,237 --> 00:04:55,070
...your Uncle Bud...

46
00:04:55,307 --> 00:04:57,366
...he passed this morning.

47
00:04:58,376 --> 00:05:02,472
I'm sorry to hear that, Mama.
How's Aunt Raynelle doing?

48
00:05:02,747 --> 00:05:04,715
How you think she's doing?

49
00:05:04,983 --> 00:05:07,975
Her husband just dropped dead...

50
00:05:08,653 --> 00:05:11,144
...in the middle of
one of my letters.

51
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:12,515
Imagine that.

52
00:05:12,757 --> 00:05:17,387
So we need to go over there
and give them some comfort.

53
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:21,563
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What do you mean, "we"?

54
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,292
You're turning
your back on your family?

55
00:05:25,804 --> 00:05:28,932
Can't someone else come get you?

56
00:05:29,207 --> 00:05:31,368
Call Junior or Ray Bud.

57
00:05:31,643 --> 00:05:33,736
They have too much to do.

58
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:35,776
And I would just die...

59
00:05:36,114 --> 00:05:37,638
...if my own son...

60
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:42,080
...didn't want to take me
to comfort my brother's widow.

61
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,279
Or maybe I should walk to Lula
in this heat.

62
00:05:46,491 --> 00:05:49,654
Or just drop dead from heat stroke!

63
00:05:49,895 --> 00:05:52,728
Okay, Mama, okay already.

64
00:05:52,931 --> 00:05:54,592
When do you want to go?

65
00:05:54,933 --> 00:05:57,800
When do you think?
Next month?

66
00:05:58,003 --> 00:06:01,336
Get your worthless self
over here now.

67
00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:04,007
Bud won't keep long in this heat.

68
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:09,913
Reverend, are you sure you don't
want a ham? I've got three.

69
00:06:10,181 --> 00:06:13,173
No, thank you. That's kind of you.

70
00:06:13,418 --> 00:06:15,443
It must be a blessing...

71
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,349
...having your daughter with you
in your bereavement.

72
00:06:19,858 --> 00:06:20,950
Yes, it is.

73
00:06:21,226 --> 00:06:26,357
- You've met Delightful, haven't you?
- Yes, I believe I have.

74
00:06:28,266 --> 00:06:29,927
She's so precious to me.

75
00:06:30,869 --> 00:06:33,133
I can see why.

76
00:06:34,906 --> 00:06:40,139
Being that brother Bud wasn't a
regular member of the church...

77
00:06:40,412 --> 00:06:45,281
...I was hoping you'd tell me
a little about him...

78
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,745
...that I can include in my remarks.

79
00:06:47,953 --> 00:06:52,720
In your own words,
what kind of man was brother Bud?

80
00:06:54,592 --> 00:06:56,457
Well...

81
00:06:56,728 --> 00:06:58,161
...he was mean.

82
00:06:59,631 --> 00:07:02,566
- Mean?
- Mean as a snake.

83
00:07:02,767 --> 00:07:04,894
- I see.
- And surly.

84
00:07:05,236 --> 00:07:06,328
Surly?

85
00:07:08,106 --> 00:07:12,600
Sister, I didn't know
brother Slocumb well.

86
00:07:12,844 --> 00:07:15,642
But to me he seemed...

87
00:07:15,914 --> 00:07:19,406
...a quiet man.
A man of inner strength.

88
00:07:20,085 --> 00:07:22,610
A man who knew his own mind...

89
00:07:22,821 --> 00:07:25,915
...and was at peace with the world.

90
00:07:26,124 --> 00:07:29,116
A wise, noble, gentle man.

91
00:07:29,361 --> 00:07:33,525
Well, you didn't know him
until he got old and sick.

92
00:07:33,798 --> 00:07:37,495
But he was mean,
and he was right surly.

93
00:07:39,104 --> 00:07:42,767
Sister, in my experience,
it's best...

94
00:07:43,074 --> 00:07:45,634
...to remember the happier times.

95
00:07:45,844 --> 00:07:48,813
Well, they were few and far between.

96
00:07:49,714 --> 00:07:53,013
Let me explain something to you,
reverend.

97
00:07:53,251 --> 00:07:58,188
After my two boys were born,
I decided to go back to church.

98
00:07:58,656 --> 00:08:01,955
And once we went
to a revival meeting.

99
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,492
And I got saved.

100
00:08:04,763 --> 00:08:06,594
And I was so happy.

101
00:08:06,998 --> 00:08:10,399
I came rushing back to tell Bud.

102
00:08:10,602 --> 00:08:14,834
He hit the ceiling.
Cursed me out real good.

103
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,399
And I said, "Bud!

104
00:08:17,675 --> 00:08:19,666
This is your immortal soul.

105
00:08:19,911 --> 00:08:23,005
If you don't go
to that revival meeting...

106
00:08:23,214 --> 00:08:25,341
...it will be in danger."

107
00:08:26,418 --> 00:08:28,409
He wouldn't have it.

108
00:08:28,686 --> 00:08:30,745
So I said, "Well...

109
00:08:31,022 --> 00:08:33,422
...if that's how you feel...

110
00:08:33,691 --> 00:08:36,888
...I'm just gonna
cut you off altogether."

111
00:08:37,228 --> 00:08:40,288
- I beg your pardon?
- Not so much...

112
00:08:40,565 --> 00:08:44,262
...as a warm handshake in 20 years.

113
00:08:44,569 --> 00:08:46,833
Except for that one time.

114
00:08:54,446 --> 00:08:59,543
Well, I believe I have all the
information I'm gonna need.

115
00:09:07,058 --> 00:09:09,686
I don't know what I'm gonna say.

116
00:09:09,961 --> 00:09:12,759
Lord knows how I'll get through it.

117
00:09:12,964 --> 00:09:16,798
The humiliation of knowing
Daddy Bud died...

118
00:09:17,168 --> 00:09:21,161
...knowing you never made
nothing of yourself.

119
00:09:22,273 --> 00:09:25,265
It'll be sad to think that...

120
00:09:25,477 --> 00:09:28,674
...Daddy knew we sold everything...

121
00:09:28,913 --> 00:09:33,850
...to move into that trailer to
pay off that dream of yours.

122
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,321
Set that to music, Charisse...

123
00:09:38,656 --> 00:09:40,954
...you'll make everyone cry.

124
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:44,151
I was just stating the facts, Junior.

125
00:09:44,362 --> 00:09:46,853
I loved him like my own daddy.

126
00:09:49,367 --> 00:09:51,665
You know something, Junior?

127
00:09:51,936 --> 00:09:56,134
I was just thinking
your family never liked me.

128
00:09:56,341 --> 00:09:57,501
Never!

129
00:09:57,775 --> 00:10:02,940
They're looking down at us
just having a good old laugh.

130
00:10:04,015 --> 00:10:09,214
Who ever thought of a machine
that cleans parking lots? Really!

131
00:10:09,721 --> 00:10:13,680
All our money right down the crapper.
Whoosh!

132
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:15,220
Just gone.

133
00:10:17,061 --> 00:10:19,393
Damn it, boy! Damn shoe.

134
00:10:19,664 --> 00:10:22,633
Walk around
with one on your foot now.

135
00:10:22,834 --> 00:10:26,531
You know, I could have been
a professional.

136
00:10:27,138 --> 00:10:30,005
- I had talent.
- Talent?

137
00:10:33,244 --> 00:10:37,078
Let me tell you something else,
Mr. Funnyman...

138
00:10:37,382 --> 00:10:42,081
...I could have been lap-tied
to your cousin Teddy Wayne...

139
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,585
...and been the wife of a lawyer.

140
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,421
You're pushing it.

141
00:10:47,692 --> 00:10:50,593
But I couldn't think about myself.

142
00:10:52,263 --> 00:10:56,256
I had to listen to my heart
and marry a fool.

143
00:10:56,534 --> 00:10:59,731
Who spent all our money
on his dream.

144
00:11:00,171 --> 00:11:03,038
- I'm gonna kill us, Charisse.
- Oh, please!

145
00:11:03,274 --> 00:11:07,677
- I'm gonna kill us.
- You ain't gonna kill nobody.

146
00:11:07,946 --> 00:11:11,211
I'm gonna kill us!

147
00:11:21,359 --> 00:11:23,350
Shut up! Just shut up!

148
00:11:27,765 --> 00:11:29,926
My daddy just died.

149
00:11:30,535 --> 00:11:34,801
I'm 33 years old, I'm dead broke,
I've got no money...

150
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,736
...three kids and worst of all
I'm married to you.

151
00:11:39,877 --> 00:11:41,572
Now just shut it up!

152
00:11:43,815 --> 00:11:48,218
I swear before God,
one more word about parking lots...

153
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:52,150
...I will kill you, and me too.
You got that?

154
00:11:53,091 --> 00:11:55,651
Do you got that?

155
00:12:01,299 --> 00:12:04,735
You'll have to buy some bullets first.

156
00:12:04,936 --> 00:12:07,097
Put that thing away.

157
00:12:08,306 --> 00:12:10,331
Put it away!

158
00:12:10,742 --> 00:12:14,678
How dare you pull that out
in front of these kids?

159
00:12:16,614 --> 00:12:19,947
You know your daddy was just playing.

160
00:12:20,285 --> 00:12:22,116
He really love us...

161
00:12:22,353 --> 00:12:26,915
...he just goes through something
sometimes. Right, baby?

162
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,650
Y'all play nice, now.

163
00:12:36,868 --> 00:12:40,326
I'm trying to make
funeral arrangements.

164
00:12:40,872 --> 00:12:44,535
Ray's family will
probably ride in the hearse.

165
00:12:44,809 --> 00:12:47,471
So tell Antoine...

166
00:12:48,346 --> 00:12:49,836
Oh, he does?

167
00:12:50,048 --> 00:12:54,109
What if one of us drove it?
Ray Bud's a good driver.

168
00:12:54,319 --> 00:12:56,344
Let's toss him on a truck.

169
00:12:56,688 --> 00:12:58,952
I've gotta let you go, okay?

170
00:12:59,157 --> 00:13:01,887
I got family coming
and nothing to eat.

171
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,651
So I'll stop by later, okay?

172
00:13:04,896 --> 00:13:07,694
And we'll work out the details.

173
00:13:12,904 --> 00:13:14,394
Thanks, Merline.

174
00:13:14,706 --> 00:13:18,301
What are you thanking her for?
Damn thieves!

175
00:13:22,413 --> 00:13:23,505
Ray?

176
00:13:24,215 --> 00:13:27,673
Antoine and Merline are grave robbers.

177
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:30,820
Now, Ray, let's just stay calm.

178
00:13:31,055 --> 00:13:36,186
And why is Daddy at Depew's anyway?
Slocumbs always go to Patterson's.

179
00:13:36,494 --> 00:13:40,055
I don't know, but
it's what your mom wanted.

180
00:13:40,331 --> 00:13:43,232
It's revenge.
I'm right where he wants me.

181
00:13:43,501 --> 00:13:44,866
What do you mean?

182
00:13:45,103 --> 00:13:48,664
Antoine Depew. "P.U." Depew?
Remember that?

183
00:13:48,906 --> 00:13:52,569
- You started that?
- It followed him all through school.

184
00:13:52,844 --> 00:13:55,074
Ray, you're talking crazy.

185
00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:00,410
You know how I hate funerals, Lucille.
People asking how you feel.

186
00:14:00,718 --> 00:14:04,154
- It doesn't matter how people feel.
- Honey!

187
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:09,524
It's all right. Okay? Just relax.

188
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:11,592
I know how hard this is.

189
00:14:11,863 --> 00:14:14,423
You and Daddy had some problems.

190
00:14:14,699 --> 00:14:16,462
But we're family.

191
00:14:16,701 --> 00:14:19,966
And we'll get through this
together. Okay?

192
00:14:21,305 --> 00:14:22,932
There you go.

193
00:14:23,274 --> 00:14:24,639
Speaking of family...

194
00:14:24,909 --> 00:14:28,037
...Marguerite is
staying with your mama.

195
00:14:28,413 --> 00:14:30,643
- That's good.
- Good. And also...

196
00:14:32,383 --> 00:14:35,250
...Junior's family is staying here.

197
00:14:35,486 --> 00:14:37,954
- No!
- Ray Bud, he's your brother.

198
00:14:38,256 --> 00:14:41,487
Not here. They can go stay at a motel.

199
00:14:41,726 --> 00:14:44,524
- They can't afford it.
- Is that my fault?

200
00:14:44,729 --> 00:14:47,755
Did I make him
follow that pipe dream?

201
00:14:47,999 --> 00:14:51,560
You shouldn't talk like that.
He tried so hard.

202
00:14:51,769 --> 00:14:54,636
Face it, Lucille, he's an idiot.

203
00:14:54,906 --> 00:14:57,340
I don't need Charisse's mouth...

204
00:14:57,575 --> 00:14:59,634
...or those demonic kids.

205
00:14:59,844 --> 00:15:02,278
We'll talk about it tonight.

206
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,745
But don't forget the shoes.
Size 10-D.

207
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:08,816
I'll remember, Lucille. Okay?

208
00:15:11,656 --> 00:15:14,648
We're not gonna have any problems,
are we?

209
00:15:14,859 --> 00:15:18,454
We're not gonna have any problems.
But do me a favor.

210
00:15:18,696 --> 00:15:20,425
When I die...

211
00:15:20,665 --> 00:15:24,192
...just bury me out in the backyard.

212
00:15:41,352 --> 00:15:43,684
What is in your mouth?

213
00:15:43,955 --> 00:15:46,219
What's wrong with you?
Give me that.

214
00:15:46,457 --> 00:15:47,549
Boy, eat it!

215
00:15:47,792 --> 00:15:49,885
Let it go!

216
00:15:52,096 --> 00:15:54,690
- Junior?
- What?

217
00:15:55,733 --> 00:15:57,701
- What's this?
- I don't know.

218
00:15:58,069 --> 00:16:02,699
This looks like a woman's earring,
but it ain't mine.

219
00:16:02,907 --> 00:16:04,602
- Junior!
- What?

220
00:16:05,443 --> 00:16:06,774
Whose is it?

221
00:16:08,012 --> 00:16:11,209
- Baby, I don't know.
- You don't know?

222
00:16:11,415 --> 00:16:15,579
You want me to help you remember?
Is that it?

223
00:16:26,898 --> 00:16:29,196
- Ray Bud?
- Yeah?

224
00:16:35,206 --> 00:16:37,674
It's all just a mystery, huh?

225
00:16:41,045 --> 00:16:42,672
Life and death.

226
00:16:45,249 --> 00:16:47,740
Yes, it is, Clyde. Yes, it is.

227
00:16:51,422 --> 00:16:54,016
Ain't easy losing your daddy.

228
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:57,887
Taught you how to bait a hook.

229
00:16:58,095 --> 00:17:02,429
Teach you right from wrong,
bought you your first beer.

230
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,759
We remember the good things.

231
00:17:05,403 --> 00:17:09,134
Yep. I ought to get back
to this carburetor.

232
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,501
We're not just a garage, Ray.

233
00:17:12,076 --> 00:17:14,101
We're your family.

234
00:17:14,378 --> 00:17:19,406
Back when you was a drunken bum,
we stood by you.

235
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:23,743
Paid your bills, lied to your wife.
Family things.

236
00:17:24,522 --> 00:17:28,049
And I sure am grateful for that,
Clyde.

237
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,723
Of course, I wouldn't let
Antoine and Merline Depew...

238
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:35,430
...bury my dog, much less my daddy.

239
00:17:36,467 --> 00:17:40,198
So if you have any problems,
just give us a call.

240
00:17:41,072 --> 00:17:45,873
- Thank you, Clyde, I gotta get back.
- Now if...

241
00:17:46,077 --> 00:17:47,908
...you just say the word...

242
00:17:48,746 --> 00:17:53,945
...the Depews will pay more in hearse
repair than they make in a year.

243
00:17:54,652 --> 00:17:59,453
Thank you, Clyde.
I'll keep that in mind.

244
00:17:59,757 --> 00:18:00,815
Ray Bud?

245
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:03,954
It's your cousin Royce.

246
00:18:06,464 --> 00:18:07,761
This is Ray.

247
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,093
Where are you?

248
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:13,798
What did he say?

249
00:18:14,071 --> 00:18:15,971
He'll get here when he can.

250
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,238
Do you do this to torture me?

251
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:24,607
Yeah, Mama. I siphoned out the gas
so we'd have time together.

252
00:18:24,982 --> 00:18:28,110
You're a demon.
The devil incarnate.

253
00:18:28,686 --> 00:18:30,779
IKeep your drawers on, okay?

254
00:18:31,022 --> 00:18:33,013
Ray Bud is on his way...

255
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:36,418
...and he can't get here
fast enough for me.

256
00:18:36,794 --> 00:18:41,254
So let's just sit here
and be quiet for a while.

257
00:19:28,479 --> 00:19:30,538
Jesus got the knob!

258
00:19:32,983 --> 00:19:33,972
That's cool...

259
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,982
...that's cool.

260
00:19:37,254 --> 00:19:40,917
- 'Cause Satan got the key!
- Give me that!

261
00:19:43,561 --> 00:19:46,394
I cannot believe I spent 17 hours...

262
00:19:46,664 --> 00:19:49,155
...in labor with you!

263
00:19:53,237 --> 00:19:55,364
You get back here! Royce!

264
00:19:55,606 --> 00:19:59,565
You get back here, boy,
before I hurt you!

265
00:20:03,147 --> 00:20:06,446
We combine a thrifty,
no-nonsense approach...

266
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:09,380
...with a Christ-like sensitivity...

267
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:13,249
...to answer all your funeral needs.

268
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:19,655
We have a number of wonderful plans.
Let me tell you about them.

269
00:20:21,432 --> 00:20:23,229
The Eternal Life plan...

270
00:20:23,434 --> 00:20:24,901
Seventeen hours...

271
00:20:25,302 --> 00:20:27,293
...of unbelievable torment.

272
00:20:27,571 --> 00:20:30,233
Crying out in unbearable agony!

273
00:20:30,508 --> 00:20:35,172
Would it kill you to do one thing
to please me?

274
00:20:35,446 --> 00:20:38,313
- It looks that way.
- Since you got fired...

275
00:20:38,582 --> 00:20:42,484
...from that sewage plant,
you've been with a bad crowd.

276
00:20:42,686 --> 00:20:44,916
You'll be like your brother.

277
00:20:45,189 --> 00:20:47,180
Leave Lavar out of this.

278
00:20:47,525 --> 00:20:50,119
Maybe you'll end up neighbors in jail.

279
00:20:50,761 --> 00:20:55,323
The two of you can beat on
the bars with your tin cups.

280
00:20:57,601 --> 00:21:02,129
- I ain't got time for this...
- You wait up, boy!

281
00:21:02,773 --> 00:21:05,469
There's a gas station
down this road.

282
00:21:05,709 --> 00:21:07,700
I'm gonna get some gas.

283
00:21:08,012 --> 00:21:11,470
Go on, get your gas.
Maybe if I'm lucky...

284
00:21:11,715 --> 00:21:15,276
...I'll get killed by some big semi!

285
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:17,612
So go on, get your gas.

286
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,987
All right, Mama.

287
00:21:25,229 --> 00:21:27,561
What do you want to talk about?

288
00:21:27,832 --> 00:21:29,527
Where is your life going?

289
00:21:29,934 --> 00:21:32,198
Them unemployment checks...

290
00:21:32,536 --> 00:21:36,700
...don't come forever.
Have you thought about that?

291
00:21:36,907 --> 00:21:40,399
Life isn't just drinking
and loose women.

292
00:21:40,678 --> 00:21:44,079
- Life is not a good time.
- You're proof of that.

293
00:21:44,281 --> 00:21:46,875
Boy, watch your mouth or...

294
00:21:47,117 --> 00:21:50,746
You straighten up
or you'll burn in hell.

295
00:21:51,021 --> 00:21:54,081
You better come up with a plan,
and soon.

296
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:57,192
- I got a plan.
- Well, what is it?

297
00:21:57,561 --> 00:21:59,051
You're right.

298
00:21:59,363 --> 00:22:03,265
Those checks won't come forever.
I think about that.

299
00:22:03,467 --> 00:22:04,593
When they stop...

300
00:22:04,969 --> 00:22:07,631
...I'm gonna find me a gal.

301
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:11,205
A good Christian gal
and settle down.

302
00:22:11,442 --> 00:22:13,433
Quit all this foolishness.

303
00:22:13,711 --> 00:22:17,738
I know you want grandbabies.
You've always said that.

304
00:22:18,249 --> 00:22:21,275
I figure I'd have me one or two kids.

305
00:22:24,722 --> 00:22:27,919
So I can get on welfare.

306
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:29,592
Welfare?

307
00:22:30,294 --> 00:22:32,762
- Is that your plan?
- That's it.

308
00:22:33,097 --> 00:22:36,828
You want to know
what I say to that?

309
00:22:54,418 --> 00:22:56,409
Now, look here...

310
00:22:56,754 --> 00:23:00,588
...I'll throw in the folding
chairs this one time.

311
00:23:00,958 --> 00:23:03,620
Return the funeral books
in the morning.

312
00:23:04,028 --> 00:23:07,156
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye-bye.

313
00:23:13,037 --> 00:23:15,471
Oh, no, no! Oh!

314
00:23:21,111 --> 00:23:23,545
I have people coming.

315
00:23:24,548 --> 00:23:25,947
What am I gonna do?

316
00:23:27,518 --> 00:23:29,782
I hope they like corn dogs.

317
00:23:51,909 --> 00:23:53,968
Come on, Delightful.

318
00:23:57,348 --> 00:24:01,307
- What about this one?
- Whatever you want, Mama.

319
00:24:02,419 --> 00:24:04,410
I like the Diplomat.

320
00:24:04,655 --> 00:24:07,556
Who cares what you like, Satan?

321
00:24:07,758 --> 00:24:09,419
Does it really matter?

322
00:24:09,727 --> 00:24:12,855
What you gonna do?
Put him in a pine box?

323
00:24:13,097 --> 00:24:15,361
Of course not, Marguerite.

324
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:18,534
- Corn dog, Mama Ray?
- No, thank you.

325
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:22,533
You a lying, stubborn man! Get out!

326
00:24:23,674 --> 00:24:26,268
Junior? Is Charisse all right?

327
00:24:27,911 --> 00:24:31,506
I think so.
Sometimes she gets these headaches.

328
00:24:31,715 --> 00:24:34,513
That's too bad.
You want a corn dog?

329
00:24:36,086 --> 00:24:39,419
- Thanks, Lucille.
- You're welcome. Take a napkin.

330
00:24:46,263 --> 00:24:49,892
- You decide on anything?
- Mama's still thinking.

331
00:24:50,134 --> 00:24:55,094
- I like the Heavenly Express.
- You do, do you?

332
00:24:55,439 --> 00:24:59,273
- It's pretty.
- It seems kind of pricey to me.

333
00:24:59,643 --> 00:25:02,908
You can't be thinking like that, man.

334
00:25:03,113 --> 00:25:07,413
This is our only Daddy
and we're gonna do this right.

335
00:25:07,651 --> 00:25:10,449
We ain't gonna worry about cost.

336
00:25:10,921 --> 00:25:13,389
- Yeah?
- That's what family's for.

337
00:25:13,791 --> 00:25:18,558
- Here's what I think...
- Ray, will you help me in the kitchen?

338
00:25:23,233 --> 00:25:25,827
- Sorry to interrupt.
- Charisse!

339
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:28,903
- How you feeling?
- Not well, Lucille.

340
00:25:29,106 --> 00:25:32,598
- My kids driving you crazy?
- No. They're outside.

341
00:25:35,813 --> 00:25:39,340
Stop that!
Don't make me come out there!

342
00:25:39,616 --> 00:25:42,915
I'll beat your ass
if your daddy won't.

343
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,610
Lucille, listen...

344
00:25:44,855 --> 00:25:47,653
...can I borrow some nerve pills?

345
00:25:47,858 --> 00:25:50,122
Sure. I'll be right back.

346
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,851
- Precious...
- Junior! Get my shoe.

347
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:54,922
Yes, ma'am.

348
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:08,607
Here you go, sweetie.

349
00:26:11,448 --> 00:26:14,042
I'm sorry you're not feeling well.

350
00:26:14,518 --> 00:26:17,180
Mama Ray, I'm the one that's sorry.

351
00:26:17,988 --> 00:26:21,219
'Cause I've watched something
I loved...

352
00:26:21,458 --> 00:26:26,555
...shrivel up and die right
before your very eyes.

353
00:26:27,131 --> 00:26:28,462
It's sad.

354
00:26:28,665 --> 00:26:32,362
- Here you go, Charisse, honey.
- Thank you.

355
00:26:32,569 --> 00:26:34,969
- You are a comfort.
- You're welcome.

356
00:26:35,172 --> 00:26:36,969
Honey, we should just...

357
00:26:37,207 --> 00:26:41,234
...go lay you down in the bedroom
so you can rest.

358
00:26:41,545 --> 00:26:45,572
Maybe you're right.
I am feeling a little faint.

359
00:26:47,584 --> 00:26:51,680
- Did I just drop something?
- Charisse?

360
00:26:51,922 --> 00:26:54,220
I believe it's your earring.

361
00:26:54,491 --> 00:26:57,483
This is not mine, Lucille.

362
00:26:57,728 --> 00:27:00,492
Everybody, take a look at this.

363
00:27:01,265 --> 00:27:03,563
I would never, ever...

364
00:27:03,834 --> 00:27:08,203
...wear something so cheap and tawdry!
- Charisse...

365
00:27:08,405 --> 00:27:13,104
...you should be laying down
when those pills kick in. Come on.

366
00:27:13,777 --> 00:27:16,177
All it takes is some thought...

367
00:27:16,413 --> 00:27:19,678
...but I know I know who owns this.

368
00:27:19,917 --> 00:27:24,581
Just a little thought, baby.
I'm gonna find out who it is.

369
00:27:25,222 --> 00:27:29,283
I could have married
the rich Slocumb, Teddy Wayne!

370
00:27:31,195 --> 00:27:34,790
- I vote for the Heavenly Express.
- So do I.

371
00:27:35,098 --> 00:27:39,262
Now can we talk about headstones
before we all die?

372
00:27:39,469 --> 00:27:42,131
I'm sure you got something to say.

373
00:27:42,439 --> 00:27:46,307
I think it should
include some scripture.

374
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:51,345
- My first idea was Ecclesiastes 2:16.
- Aunt Marguerite, please!

375
00:27:51,582 --> 00:27:56,110
"There is no remembrance
of the wise more than of the fool..."

376
00:27:56,453 --> 00:28:00,389
- Aunt Marguerite, please.
- No, no, Ray.

377
00:28:01,058 --> 00:28:03,185
That would be good, Mama.

378
00:28:03,393 --> 00:28:06,385
Look, could we slow down a little?

379
00:28:06,697 --> 00:28:08,892
For the price of the stone...

380
00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:12,965
...we get the date of birth and death.
More costs extra.

381
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:15,600
- Extra?
- Two bucks a letter.

382
00:28:15,806 --> 00:28:19,037
- How many words in that?
- One, two, three...

383
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:21,878
That won't cost too much.

384
00:28:22,112 --> 00:28:24,876
It'll be more than you'll kick in.

385
00:28:25,315 --> 00:28:27,078
So what are you saying?

386
00:28:27,284 --> 00:28:29,809
You saying I won't pay my share?

387
00:28:30,053 --> 00:28:34,615
It's easy for you to come in
here and shoot your big mouth off.

388
00:28:34,825 --> 00:28:37,919
- Would he do that for you?
- Yes, he would.

389
00:28:38,128 --> 00:28:39,254
You're dreaming.

390
00:28:39,463 --> 00:28:41,761
This is our last chance...

391
00:28:41,965 --> 00:28:44,957
...to help Dad, and you're being cheap.

392
00:28:45,168 --> 00:28:47,432
It's not all about money.

393
00:28:47,671 --> 00:28:52,472
That's why you don't
have two nickels to rub together.

394
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:55,738
I saw that new used truck outside.

395
00:28:56,179 --> 00:28:59,444
I heard about your trip
to Swamp World.

396
00:29:00,784 --> 00:29:05,153
- What about it?
- I'd like to take my kids there.

397
00:29:05,422 --> 00:29:07,287
- What about that?
- Yeah?

398
00:29:07,524 --> 00:29:12,655
Those monsters can ride around on
your invention in the parking lot.

399
00:29:13,463 --> 00:29:17,627
- You talk about my machine, my kids?
- Yeah. Yeah.

400
00:29:17,834 --> 00:29:20,359
Why you talk about my kids?
IKnow what?

401
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:23,403
- At least I got kids.
- Okay, tough guy.

402
00:29:28,512 --> 00:29:31,572
Let me go so I can kick your ass!

403
00:29:31,848 --> 00:29:34,874
- Come on!
- Don't let him do that to you!

404
00:29:37,187 --> 00:29:38,848
Ray! Junior!

405
00:29:42,025 --> 00:29:44,016
Stop it, stop it!

406
00:29:46,229 --> 00:29:47,218
Stop it!

407
00:29:47,564 --> 00:29:49,759
Stop! Don't move at all!

408
00:29:59,509 --> 00:30:01,534
Come here, Royce.

409
00:30:07,451 --> 00:30:11,751
I want you to take this to Antoine's
and tell him...

410
00:30:11,955 --> 00:30:16,415
...that this is what I want
on my husband's headstone.

411
00:30:18,295 --> 00:30:20,058
It's 12 letters.

412
00:30:20,931 --> 00:30:22,922
My wallet's in the kitchen.

413
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,261
- This is between us, right, Royce?
- Yes, ma'am.

414
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,565
I'm just gonna get some air.

415
00:30:35,112 --> 00:30:37,376
Don't say anything to me.

416
00:30:44,054 --> 00:30:45,885
Sorry, Mama.

417
00:30:50,227 --> 00:30:52,286
How can you act like this...

418
00:30:52,496 --> 00:30:55,932
...when your mama
is going through all this?

419
00:30:56,266 --> 00:30:58,564
Bud would be so upset.

420
00:30:58,769 --> 00:31:02,102
And you, acting like
you can't hear me.

421
00:31:02,305 --> 00:31:06,469
You gonna show me that note!
I can't believe this.

422
00:31:10,447 --> 00:31:12,711
You a real tough guy, ain't you?

423
00:31:19,589 --> 00:31:21,716
"Mean and surly."

424
00:31:23,293 --> 00:31:24,590
Damn.

425
00:31:31,101 --> 00:31:34,002
Okay, Aunt Marguerite.

426
00:31:34,271 --> 00:31:36,899
Oh, she's doing fine.

427
00:31:39,943 --> 00:31:43,071
Yeah, okay. I'll look that one up.

428
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,520
Good night, Junior.

429
00:31:54,758 --> 00:31:56,749
Good night, Lucille.

430
00:32:09,673 --> 00:32:10,867
Hey, Ray.

431
00:32:21,518 --> 00:32:24,214
You got yourself a little taste, man.

432
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:29,855
Yep.

433
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,858
You told Lucille you quit.

434
00:32:34,564 --> 00:32:36,361
You know how I lie.

435
00:32:41,404 --> 00:32:44,669
Sure is hot out here tonight, Ray.

436
00:32:47,344 --> 00:32:49,938
Damn, reminds me of that time...

437
00:32:50,146 --> 00:32:51,579
Sit down, Junior.

438
00:33:07,731 --> 00:33:11,565
Thanks, Ray. Sure do appreciate this.

439
00:33:15,539 --> 00:33:18,906
Sure is funny
how things work out, ain't it?

440
00:33:19,109 --> 00:33:23,409
Oh, yeah. I just laugh myself
to sleep every night.

441
00:33:28,118 --> 00:33:31,417
Look here, Ray.

442
00:33:31,621 --> 00:33:34,181
I didn't mean what I said in there.

443
00:33:34,424 --> 00:33:38,724
I was real sorry to hear
Lucille lost that last baby.

444
00:33:41,064 --> 00:33:44,227
I guess she was all
tore up about that.

445
00:33:45,468 --> 00:33:46,628
Sorry.

446
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,140
We should just quit trying.

447
00:34:00,417 --> 00:34:04,285
'Cause last time
was the absolute worst.

448
00:34:06,256 --> 00:34:08,156
The doctor told her...

449
00:34:08,391 --> 00:34:12,418
...she'd have to
lay flat on her back, not move.

450
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:18,427
We talked about it and
decided to give it one more shot.

451
00:34:18,668 --> 00:34:22,502
She went to bed,
I went to get her prescription...

452
00:34:22,806 --> 00:34:24,137
...and a bedpan.

453
00:34:24,341 --> 00:34:28,334
Got a chicken bucket in case
she had to go while I was gone.

454
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:33,140
It took longer than I expected,
and when I got back...

455
00:34:33,416 --> 00:34:35,350
...she lost it.

456
00:34:36,353 --> 00:34:38,981
In the chicken bucket, Ray?

457
00:34:40,323 --> 00:34:42,689
Chicken bucket, Junior.

458
00:34:46,863 --> 00:34:49,161
Damn, Ray.

459
00:34:50,767 --> 00:34:54,931
That's the most God-awful story
I've ever heard.

460
00:34:55,372 --> 00:34:57,602
It's pretty bad, man.

461
00:35:03,847 --> 00:35:08,045
I was sorry to hear about
your business going under.

462
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,315
Thank you, Ray.

463
00:35:23,233 --> 00:35:25,667
So you gonna tell me or not?

464
00:35:28,571 --> 00:35:31,665
I don't know,
it just kind of happened.

465
00:35:32,175 --> 00:35:36,976
I was at the Shop Well parking lot
giving a sample cleaning.

466
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:41,316
And there was this girl
loading up her car.

467
00:35:41,551 --> 00:35:44,884
We sort of
struck up this conversation.

468
00:35:45,088 --> 00:35:47,682
So I started talking
about the machine.

469
00:35:47,924 --> 00:35:50,256
She seemed real interested.

470
00:35:50,593 --> 00:35:52,220
I mean, here I was...

471
00:35:52,495 --> 00:35:57,523
...sitting on top of this big machine
like I was its master.

472
00:35:57,734 --> 00:35:59,599
And there was this woman...

473
00:35:59,836 --> 00:36:01,098
...staring at me.

474
00:36:01,838 --> 00:36:03,931
Smiling at me.

475
00:36:05,075 --> 00:36:08,602
You know, making me feel
like a man, Ray.

476
00:36:09,612 --> 00:36:13,878
I was in business
and I had control of my life.

477
00:36:14,384 --> 00:36:15,749
What happened?

478
00:36:16,052 --> 00:36:18,953
Aw, Charisse showed up.

479
00:36:19,289 --> 00:36:22,656
She was looking all hot and sweaty...

480
00:36:22,926 --> 00:36:26,384
...with all them kids
hanging off of her.

481
00:36:27,497 --> 00:36:29,829
She wanted to talk about...

482
00:36:30,066 --> 00:36:33,934
...house payments, car payments...

483
00:36:34,237 --> 00:36:36,933
...how the kids need this and that.

484
00:36:37,307 --> 00:36:40,674
And the whole time she was talking...

485
00:36:40,944 --> 00:36:46,075
...I watched that woman pack up
her stuff and drive away.

486
00:36:47,317 --> 00:36:52,152
And all of a sudden I got
this strong desire to just...

487
00:36:53,123 --> 00:36:57,321
...run Charisse over
with that machine.

488
00:36:59,763 --> 00:37:03,130
So what happened with the woman,
Junior?

489
00:37:04,567 --> 00:37:06,262
Old Bernice Talbert.

490
00:37:07,137 --> 00:37:09,605
- Bernice Talbert?
- Oh, yeah.

491
00:37:10,006 --> 00:37:14,136
- Bernice with the?
- Oh, yeah. Two.

492
00:37:25,989 --> 00:37:27,547
So now what?

493
00:37:28,057 --> 00:37:30,218
I don't know, Ray.

494
00:37:31,327 --> 00:37:35,229
Things just so messed up now, man.

495
00:37:36,566 --> 00:37:38,557
I gotta get some money.

496
00:37:39,836 --> 00:37:41,497
You will.

497
00:37:41,738 --> 00:37:43,672
You'll figure it out.

498
00:37:43,907 --> 00:37:45,397
Just not tonight.

499
00:37:55,819 --> 00:37:57,343
Junior...

500
00:37:57,587 --> 00:38:00,351
Why don't you bring
your machine over...

501
00:38:00,623 --> 00:38:04,821
...and polish up the driveway
on Sunday. I'll pay you.

502
00:38:05,028 --> 00:38:06,620
If you're not busy.

503
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:10,866
- No, Ray. Sunday's good, man.
- Yeah?

504
00:38:15,004 --> 00:38:16,835
Thanks, bro.

505
00:38:32,388 --> 00:38:33,616
Hey, Ray?

506
00:38:37,293 --> 00:38:39,853
I never thought he'd die, man.

507
00:38:40,897 --> 00:38:42,524
Did you?

508
00:39:04,354 --> 00:39:07,915
Well, friends,
it's been another busy day.

509
00:39:11,094 --> 00:39:15,690
And as I rush from place to place...

510
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:21,929
...offering comfort and counsel...

511
00:39:22,171 --> 00:39:26,164
...to some of our brothers and sisters
in crisis...

512
00:39:26,442 --> 00:39:31,539
...catharsis, and confusion...

513
00:39:31,781 --> 00:39:34,113
...I ask myself, "Beverly...

514
00:39:34,417 --> 00:39:38,046
...what is this thing called life?

515
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:45,984
Is it nothing but a collection of...

516
00:39:46,462 --> 00:39:50,558
...problems, disappointments
and heartache?

517
00:39:52,669 --> 00:39:55,900
Or do we make it that way
with all our...

518
00:39:56,139 --> 00:39:59,108
...wants, needs and desires?

519
00:40:11,287 --> 00:40:15,690
And if it is, we, ourselves...

520
00:40:15,959 --> 00:40:18,325
...then why do we do it?

521
00:40:20,463 --> 00:40:25,526
Why don't we realize that the slender
and fragile canoe of life...

522
00:40:25,835 --> 00:40:28,599
...can be so easily overturned...

523
00:40:28,805 --> 00:40:32,138
...in the turbulent rapids
of the world?

524
00:40:33,609 --> 00:40:37,705
God's gonna handle your problems.

525
00:40:38,281 --> 00:40:42,479
Why don't we learn to relax?

526
00:40:43,553 --> 00:40:46,021
And why do we...

527
00:40:46,222 --> 00:40:49,487
...have to call somebody
when we're troubled?

528
00:40:50,793 --> 00:40:54,388
Why can't we just keep it
to ourselves?

529
00:40:56,466 --> 00:40:59,902
God handles your problems.
Listen to him.

530
00:41:03,806 --> 00:41:06,036
Remember, friends...

531
00:41:06,743 --> 00:41:09,405
...our time here is short.

532
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,639
If you feel your life is nothing...

533
00:41:12,882 --> 00:41:16,045
...but unrelenting torture...

534
00:41:17,253 --> 00:41:19,585
...try to make the most of it.

535
00:41:20,089 --> 00:41:23,547
After all, tomorrow...

536
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,421
...is another day.

537
00:41:27,263 --> 00:41:30,426
Yes, call God...

538
00:41:31,367 --> 00:41:33,198
...don't call me.

539
00:41:36,906 --> 00:41:39,841
Well, let's see here.

540
00:41:40,076 --> 00:41:45,036
Friends, tonight,
we have a new sponsor:

541
00:41:46,582 --> 00:41:49,608
Depew's Funeral Home.

542
00:41:49,886 --> 00:41:53,378
"Your Pit Stop to the Afterlife."

543
00:41:54,524 --> 00:41:59,860
Depew's Funeral Home,
where longtime Lula resident...

544
00:42:00,596 --> 00:42:04,225
...Woodrow "Bud" Slocumb
is currently in repose.

545
00:42:07,236 --> 00:42:09,227
He sure looks good.

546
00:42:12,608 --> 00:42:14,303
Feets look funny.

547
00:42:16,479 --> 00:42:18,947
My daddy's wearing ballet shoes.

548
00:42:19,248 --> 00:42:22,445
You know Daddy Bud
always had arthritis.

549
00:42:22,652 --> 00:42:24,882
When he had his stroke...

550
00:42:25,154 --> 00:42:29,056
...he pointed his toes down
and they stayed that way.

551
00:42:29,258 --> 00:42:31,590
New shoes wouldn't fit at all...

552
00:42:31,828 --> 00:42:34,888
...so they just did
the best they could.

553
00:42:35,098 --> 00:42:36,998
- I'm gonna kill him.
- Ray!

554
00:42:37,266 --> 00:42:40,167
- Lucille?
- Hello there, Merline.

555
00:42:40,403 --> 00:42:43,463
Somebody has to organize this food.

556
00:42:43,739 --> 00:42:47,675
And all these people
gotta be out of here by 8:15...

557
00:42:47,944 --> 00:42:50,777
...as there's a Bisons meeting
in here.

558
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:53,505
Just take those to the kitchen...

559
00:42:53,716 --> 00:42:58,153
...and I'll be right in. Thank you.
So nice of you.

560
00:42:58,354 --> 00:43:00,549
Thank you, I'll be right in.

561
00:43:02,325 --> 00:43:05,954
Go over there
and say hello to the people.

562
00:43:06,195 --> 00:43:09,358
You can do it, baby. I know you can.

563
00:43:20,643 --> 00:43:23,009
Hey, Buster. Tiny.

564
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,648
Bud's inside. Go on in.

565
00:43:26,983 --> 00:43:30,146
I'll be back. Can I get you anything?

566
00:43:30,686 --> 00:43:33,416
Can you give me back
the last 12 years?

567
00:43:33,856 --> 00:43:38,919
Can you give me back my
dreams of a loving, faithful husband?

568
00:43:39,195 --> 00:43:40,822
Can you do that?

569
00:43:42,498 --> 00:43:43,658
No.

570
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,825
But I can get you a Pepsi.

571
00:43:47,837 --> 00:43:49,532
Pepsi's fine, adulterer.

572
00:43:51,174 --> 00:43:52,436
Damn it!

573
00:43:55,178 --> 00:43:56,475
You better run!

574
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:03,676
I'll be right back.
Just a minute. Pepsi, right?

575
00:44:08,357 --> 00:44:10,348
I love you.

576
00:44:17,533 --> 00:44:18,727
Come on.

577
00:44:23,105 --> 00:44:28,168
Ray Bud. From your mama.
I think you should see this.

578
00:44:36,786 --> 00:44:39,380
"Mean and surly"?

579
00:44:55,371 --> 00:44:58,807
They painted you up
like a two-dollar whore.

580
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,880
We sure are sorry about Bud.

581
00:45:07,316 --> 00:45:10,581
I'm so glad you and Norval
could make it.

582
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:13,482
He looks better than he did
last time.

583
00:45:13,723 --> 00:45:16,624
Since his bypass got done...

584
00:45:16,892 --> 00:45:18,985
...he's improved a lot.

585
00:45:19,295 --> 00:45:23,994
Next month, we're getting rid
of that prostate, aren't we?

586
00:45:25,268 --> 00:45:30,399
It's times like these you find out
who your real friends are.

587
00:45:32,241 --> 00:45:36,507
They park that hearse right out
on the street, you know?

588
00:45:40,516 --> 00:45:44,145
Anything could happen to it,
catch my meaning?

589
00:45:45,121 --> 00:45:48,147
I catch your meaning, Uncle Clyde.

590
00:45:53,929 --> 00:45:58,832
Say the word and that thing might
just blow up some evening.

591
00:45:59,635 --> 00:46:00,624
Thank you.

592
00:46:00,836 --> 00:46:03,828
Stranger things have happened.

593
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,137
All right, come on.

594
00:46:09,211 --> 00:46:12,544
Let's just go in there and see him.

595
00:46:13,115 --> 00:46:14,980
All right, okay.

596
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:18,213
Go on ahead. I'll be right there.

597
00:46:18,454 --> 00:46:20,183
You want me to wait?

598
00:46:20,389 --> 00:46:22,516
No, I don't want you to wait.

599
00:46:22,792 --> 00:46:25,522
Go on, I'll be in
in a minute.

600
00:46:37,373 --> 00:46:39,967
My God, what the...?!

601
00:46:40,176 --> 00:46:42,474
Don't you ever touch me!

602
00:46:51,754 --> 00:46:54,882
What's the matter? Can't you
take care of things?

603
00:46:55,391 --> 00:46:58,588
Now look.
Junior can't keep his pants on.

604
00:46:58,861 --> 00:47:03,730
Your sister won't stop eating,
and your wife can't have kids.

605
00:47:03,933 --> 00:47:07,391
I believe what you need is a drink.

606
00:47:22,351 --> 00:47:24,785
My bad, my bad, Ray.

607
00:47:26,856 --> 00:47:28,949
Can't look at him, can you?

608
00:47:47,143 --> 00:47:51,045
How's she gonna go on,
Aunt Marguerite?

609
00:47:51,781 --> 00:47:56,115
How's she gonna face life
without Daddy Bud?

610
00:47:56,719 --> 00:47:59,779
It's sad when a woman loses
her husband.

611
00:48:00,923 --> 00:48:04,256
I remember when I lost my William.

612
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:07,759
No one to cook for,
no one to clean for...

613
00:48:07,997 --> 00:48:11,489
...nobody to talk to
over the breakfast table.

614
00:48:15,738 --> 00:48:18,969
And these is my twins,
Latanya and Lasagna.

615
00:48:19,175 --> 00:48:22,508
You're so lucky to have
those precious babies.

616
00:48:22,812 --> 00:48:25,610
Ladies, just find some space.

617
00:48:25,948 --> 00:48:29,406
That's Tamika,
from my second marriage with J.C.

618
00:48:29,652 --> 00:48:32,951
Has anybody seen my sister-in-law?

619
00:48:33,489 --> 00:48:36,117
- Oh, Lord, where has he gone?
- Where?

620
00:48:36,358 --> 00:48:40,294
Why can't it all be the way
it used to be?

621
00:48:40,529 --> 00:48:44,192
Daddy Bud! Come back! Come back!

622
00:48:53,342 --> 00:48:55,173
Get ahold of yourself!

623
00:48:58,647 --> 00:49:00,808
Let's go freshen you up.

624
00:49:01,083 --> 00:49:04,075
After I irrigate him
for about an hour...

625
00:49:04,353 --> 00:49:07,220
...I usually put him out
on the porch...

626
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:08,752
...while I cook.

627
00:49:08,991 --> 00:49:11,789
One time, I left him out there...

628
00:49:12,027 --> 00:49:15,656
...and the mosquitoes ate his butt up.

629
00:49:15,865 --> 00:49:17,628
You getting anything?

630
00:49:20,135 --> 00:49:23,400
I had the same problem
when my daddy died.

631
00:49:24,139 --> 00:49:29,236
I guess seeing him like that
made me realize he was gone.

632
00:49:29,578 --> 00:49:32,206
Wasn't no going back.
Gone forever.

633
00:49:32,481 --> 00:49:34,915
Really consoling, thank you.

634
00:49:36,218 --> 00:49:40,211
You know, he looks good.
For a dead man.

635
00:49:43,659 --> 00:49:44,921
You seen Charisse?

636
00:49:45,194 --> 00:49:48,595
Lucille dragged her to the toilet.

637
00:49:48,831 --> 00:49:52,824
Shoot! I ran all the way down
to get the Pepsi...

638
00:49:56,605 --> 00:49:58,903
Would you look at that?!

639
00:49:59,341 --> 00:50:02,401
He looks dead.
You need to look at him.

640
00:50:02,611 --> 00:50:04,511
I'm sure he does.

641
00:50:05,848 --> 00:50:10,512
I'll just leave you fellas here,
so you can do your thing.

642
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:14,712
And, Ray, it helps to remember
the good times.

643
00:50:14,924 --> 00:50:16,516
Thank you, Royce.

644
00:50:16,759 --> 00:50:20,752
If you can remember any.
I'll be in the back.

645
00:50:22,097 --> 00:50:24,292
There it is, Ray. Look at it.

646
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,727
Come on. It's death.

647
00:50:27,036 --> 00:50:31,063
Look at the Grim Reaper
staring you in the face.

648
00:50:31,273 --> 00:50:34,367
- Come on, just one...
- No, Junior.

649
00:50:35,878 --> 00:50:37,436
Damn, Ray.

650
00:50:38,414 --> 00:50:39,904
You don't look so good.

651
00:50:40,449 --> 00:50:42,644
Get me out of here. Now.

652
00:50:46,822 --> 00:50:49,086
What's with the dancing shoes?

653
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:55,156
Charisse? We're getting
kind of backed up out here.

654
00:50:58,968 --> 00:51:00,663
I'll be right there!

655
00:51:00,903 --> 00:51:02,734
Okay, hurry up!

656
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:18,980
Look out, got to go. Hey, Mom.

657
00:51:21,457 --> 00:51:22,788
Get out of there!

658
00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:30,821
You just look gorgeous.

659
00:51:35,104 --> 00:51:40,098
Honey! I'm just so sorry Teddy Wayne
couldn't be here.

660
00:51:40,643 --> 00:51:44,044
He always loved his
Uncle Bud so much...

661
00:51:44,346 --> 00:51:46,940
...but his firm is doing so well...

662
00:51:47,182 --> 00:51:49,707
...it just keeps him so busy.

663
00:51:49,985 --> 00:51:51,885
Well, what a shame.

664
00:51:52,655 --> 00:51:56,216
Mama Ray must be torn up.
We got to find her.

665
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:03,559
I can do this.

666
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,058
I can do this.

667
00:52:07,636 --> 00:52:09,194
I can't do this.

668
00:52:21,483 --> 00:52:26,182
Supper's his big meal of the day
if he can keep it down.

669
00:52:26,455 --> 00:52:29,288
But once he gets his bedtime pills...

670
00:52:29,525 --> 00:52:30,890
...he sleeps well.

671
00:52:31,193 --> 00:52:33,218
But I don't get any rest...

672
00:52:33,462 --> 00:52:36,522
...having to turn
him every few hours.

673
00:52:36,999 --> 00:52:39,331
You're just so lucky to have him.

674
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:42,803
I know.

675
00:52:44,406 --> 00:52:45,703
I know.

676
00:52:46,942 --> 00:52:49,433
Where do you want this Jell-O?

677
00:52:50,546 --> 00:52:52,013
Over there.

678
00:52:52,681 --> 00:52:54,046
You know...

679
00:52:54,516 --> 00:52:58,680
...it's a shame it takes this
to bring us together.

680
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:06,089
Remember Lucille was in my royal
court when I was Candy Camp Queen?

681
00:53:06,628 --> 00:53:10,064
No. Was that when I was dating
Teddy Wayne?

682
00:53:10,265 --> 00:53:15,202
That was such a long time ago.
But you're right, Juanita.

683
00:53:15,404 --> 00:53:19,807
It's good to know we can come together
in a time of sadness.

684
00:53:20,042 --> 00:53:22,806
You are so right, Lucille, so right.

685
00:53:27,049 --> 00:53:28,380
Now.

686
00:53:28,851 --> 00:53:31,342
- How can I help?
- Break a nail.

687
00:53:33,088 --> 00:53:34,350
Honey, why don't you...

688
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:37,957
...go out there and make people happy?

689
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:42,153
It's so sweet of you. Thank you.
I'll do my best.

690
00:53:48,203 --> 00:53:52,697
I could've married
Teddy Wayne Slocumb if I wanted to.

691
00:53:53,909 --> 00:53:57,777
I could've been rich and stupid!

692
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:02,041
I would've been good at it!
But look at me.

693
00:54:02,251 --> 00:54:07,314
But who am I now?
I'm poor and foolish in a trailer.

694
00:54:07,756 --> 00:54:09,690
What happened to me?

695
00:54:10,092 --> 00:54:15,428
Honey, don't pay no attention to her.
She just thinks she's happy.

696
00:54:16,365 --> 00:54:20,233
Delightful? Could you grab
that big bowl over there?

697
00:54:20,536 --> 00:54:23,334
Be careful. It was my mother's.

698
00:54:23,539 --> 00:54:25,803
You're all right now.

699
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:37,341
Are you still
in your church groups?

700
00:54:37,586 --> 00:54:41,488
I'm vice president of the
Ladies' African Missionary Club.

701
00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:43,749
Get a rag and wipe that off.

702
00:54:44,693 --> 00:54:46,718
Oh, my God. Delightful!

703
00:54:46,929 --> 00:54:51,229
Y'all go out front till
dinner's ready, about 15 minutes.

704
00:54:57,005 --> 00:55:00,441
Honey? People are beginning
to talk about you.

705
00:55:01,043 --> 00:55:04,012
You gonna stay in there all night?

706
00:55:04,713 --> 00:55:06,078
Baby?

707
00:55:08,016 --> 00:55:10,610
You're the only woman for me.

708
00:55:10,886 --> 00:55:13,013
I knew that from day one.

709
00:55:13,222 --> 00:55:16,282
Remember how we went to Dairy Whiz?

710
00:55:16,525 --> 00:55:19,688
And I bought that
Fizzy Cream you like.

711
00:55:20,929 --> 00:55:24,626
And we sat out on your front yard?

712
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:27,630
Talked about our future,
feeling so good.

713
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:30,862
Like we had our whole lives before us.

714
00:55:31,206 --> 00:55:33,037
I don't know, baby.

715
00:55:33,275 --> 00:55:35,937
You know I ain't good at this.

716
00:55:36,612 --> 00:55:39,945
Out in that parking lot,
I just lost my head.

717
00:55:40,782 --> 00:55:43,876
And now I'm praying that...

718
00:55:44,152 --> 00:55:47,417
...you might want to take me back.

719
00:55:48,290 --> 00:55:52,989
'Cause if I learned one thing,
it's that I'm nothing without you.

720
00:55:55,631 --> 00:55:57,792
You are my world, Charisse.

721
00:55:58,233 --> 00:55:59,427
And I love you.

722
00:56:04,973 --> 00:56:06,964
I love you too, Junior.

723
00:56:07,409 --> 00:56:10,139
You could have told me it was you.

724
00:56:31,667 --> 00:56:33,658
At least it was quick.

725
00:56:34,336 --> 00:56:36,031
Quick's the best way.

726
00:56:36,305 --> 00:56:39,502
You don't want to linger.
That's awful.

727
00:56:39,708 --> 00:56:40,970
Quick.

728
00:56:42,311 --> 00:56:44,279
That's how I want to go.

729
00:56:45,147 --> 00:56:47,707
Car crash. Bolt of lightning.

730
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:52,216
Piano falling on my head.
That's what I want.

731
00:56:52,988 --> 00:56:55,218
That's what I want for you.

732
00:56:55,524 --> 00:56:57,014
Me too.

733
00:56:59,828 --> 00:57:03,889
God, we both know there's
nothing in that liquor store...

734
00:57:04,166 --> 00:57:06,464
...to help me or anyone.

735
00:57:06,702 --> 00:57:09,136
So if you can start this car...

736
00:57:09,371 --> 00:57:13,705
...before I reach the door handle,
I'd appreciate it.

737
00:57:16,178 --> 00:57:17,167
Evening, Ray.

738
00:57:18,747 --> 00:57:21,238
Reverend. Mrs. Hooker.

739
00:57:21,817 --> 00:57:25,412
We're about to visit your family
for a while.

740
00:57:25,654 --> 00:57:27,884
Did you want to follow us?

741
00:57:28,657 --> 00:57:30,386
You bet, reverend.

742
00:57:40,669 --> 00:57:42,261
Thank you, God.

743
00:58:00,288 --> 00:58:01,448
You seen Royce?

744
00:58:01,723 --> 00:58:04,157
No, honey. Not in a while.

745
00:58:04,393 --> 00:58:06,384
I hope y'all can use this.

746
00:58:06,895 --> 00:58:09,125
Well, thank you, Bernice.

747
00:58:15,537 --> 00:58:19,268
- No! Uh-uh.
- We're gonna start real soon, Merline.

748
00:58:19,541 --> 00:58:21,532
We're gonna start real soon.

749
00:58:21,743 --> 00:58:23,608
Delightful, do me a favor...

750
00:58:23,879 --> 00:58:27,576
...put this up
where no one can get to it, okay?

751
00:58:28,817 --> 00:58:32,048
- That's a bowl of funk.
- It's Bernice's.

752
00:58:32,487 --> 00:58:35,650
- Is that Bernice Talbert?
- Uh-huh.

753
00:58:38,126 --> 00:58:40,458
- She's a God-awful mess.

754
00:58:40,662 --> 00:58:42,926
She ain't no one's prize...

755
00:58:43,131 --> 00:58:46,623
...and she'll rip that skirt off
for anyone.

756
00:58:46,835 --> 00:58:49,395
I saw her not two weeks ago...

757
00:58:49,638 --> 00:58:52,971
...staggering out of some
old Cadillac...

758
00:58:53,241 --> 00:58:56,642
...wearing one earring. Just tacky.

759
00:58:58,213 --> 00:59:01,478
- All right, y'all...
- Anyone seen Charisse?

760
00:59:04,219 --> 00:59:07,711
- Bernice Talbert?
- What'd I say?

761
00:59:09,491 --> 00:59:14,588
My husband did it to that child
in the Shop Well parking lot?!

762
00:59:15,263 --> 00:59:17,788
Lord, take me now!

763
00:59:19,234 --> 00:59:22,897
Don't pay her any mind.
She just likes attention.

764
00:59:24,239 --> 00:59:27,072
Will you quit harping on that?

765
00:59:27,576 --> 00:59:30,943
Come on, we got a lot
of good food here.

766
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:36,012
We got beans, macaroni and cheese,
some yams and...

767
00:59:36,284 --> 00:59:39,776
...somebody even brought us some...

768
00:59:43,358 --> 00:59:45,258
Who brought this?

769
00:59:46,194 --> 00:59:48,628
Lucille? Honey, what's wrong?

770
00:59:51,299 --> 00:59:55,099
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

771
00:59:56,505 --> 00:59:59,633
Get out! Out! Out!

772
01:00:02,444 --> 01:00:04,571
- Lucille?
- Leave me alone!

773
01:00:06,248 --> 01:00:11,015
Charisse! Don't nobody care about
your husband and Bernice.

774
01:00:11,253 --> 01:00:14,416
Come out here
or I'll sic Delightful on you.

775
01:00:14,923 --> 01:00:18,916
- Let me come in for one second.
- Leave me alone!

776
01:00:20,529 --> 01:00:25,228
- You don't understand!
- I don't understand?

777
01:00:26,034 --> 01:00:30,562
You think you're the only one with
heartache? I have a son in jail!

778
01:00:30,772 --> 01:00:35,471
You don't see me wallow on the floor,
or hiding in a closet.

779
01:00:35,911 --> 01:00:38,812
This closet's taken,
you can't have it!

780
01:00:40,081 --> 01:00:43,380
Move! You want anger, lady?

781
01:00:43,618 --> 01:00:46,746
You listen to me.
We are family!

782
01:00:46,955 --> 01:00:51,051
We are the Slocumbs!
And we are gonna serve this dinner...

783
01:00:51,293 --> 01:00:54,387
...with our heads held high
if it kills us.

784
01:00:54,596 --> 01:00:58,327
Now you come on.
You come on right here.

785
01:01:01,303 --> 01:01:06,502
Come in, people, get your plates.
We ain't got all day.

786
01:01:08,843 --> 01:01:13,143
I am so glad you could come,
reverend.

787
01:01:13,415 --> 01:01:17,181
Mrs. Slocumb, I am sorry
and I'm glad I can be here.

788
01:01:17,586 --> 01:01:20,111
I'm just so sorry, Ray.

789
01:01:20,322 --> 01:01:22,654
Thank you, Charles. Thank you.

790
01:01:23,258 --> 01:01:26,352
I had no idea your daddy
was a dancer.

791
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:32,466
It was a well-kept secret, Charles.

792
01:01:32,801 --> 01:01:35,861
We thank you, Lord,
for these blessings.

793
01:01:36,104 --> 01:01:38,197
And last but not least, Lord...

794
01:01:38,473 --> 01:01:43,376
...you know who has done filthy things
with Bernice Talbert.

795
01:01:43,678 --> 01:01:46,943
I won't repeat their names,
but I could...

796
01:01:47,182 --> 01:01:50,709
...if I was provoked. Amen.
- Amen.

797
01:01:50,952 --> 01:01:52,180
In Jesus' name.

798
01:01:52,454 --> 01:01:57,517
Everyone, step lively.
The Bisons have this room next.

799
01:02:55,950 --> 01:02:58,248
I just wanted to call...

800
01:02:58,453 --> 01:03:02,412
...and make sure you
got into the house okay.

801
01:03:03,124 --> 01:03:06,855
- We here, Ray.
- We'll be home in a little bit.

802
01:03:17,072 --> 01:03:21,270
I sure hated not being able to
visit with everybody.

803
01:03:22,377 --> 01:03:25,608
It's just so sweet.
All those people.

804
01:03:26,114 --> 01:03:30,574
Each of them touched in some way
by Daddy Bud.

805
01:03:32,153 --> 01:03:34,348
They was touched, all right.

806
01:03:35,890 --> 01:03:38,950
These shirts here are for Junior.

807
01:03:39,227 --> 01:03:44,255
He can't be looking like a scarecrow
when he's looking for a job.

808
01:03:45,934 --> 01:03:49,062
- About ready to go, honey?
- No.

809
01:03:49,270 --> 01:03:53,036
I wanna talk to Mama
for a little while, okay?

810
01:03:53,241 --> 01:03:55,505
- Get some rest.
- I will.

811
01:04:14,095 --> 01:04:15,756
Ray.

812
01:04:20,235 --> 01:04:22,169
Mama...

813
01:04:22,470 --> 01:04:25,132
...Antoine told me
about the tombstone.

814
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:29,005
I'm not having it.
It'll say, "Rest in peace."

815
01:04:29,344 --> 01:04:33,405
Which is 11 letters.
We get a two-dollar credit.

816
01:04:33,648 --> 01:04:37,140
That's it, Mama. Period.
That's it.

817
01:04:40,522 --> 01:04:42,490
All right.

818
01:04:45,393 --> 01:04:47,224
I understand that.

819
01:04:49,731 --> 01:04:54,168
Well, that's all I had to say.
I'll let you go to bed.

820
01:04:55,937 --> 01:04:58,667
Can you take a minute with me?

821
01:04:58,907 --> 01:05:01,375
- Sure.
- I wanna show you something.

822
01:05:01,609 --> 01:05:02,871
Help me up.

823
01:05:18,726 --> 01:05:20,626
Do you remember these?

824
01:05:22,697 --> 01:05:24,289
Can't say I do.

825
01:05:24,499 --> 01:05:26,865
These were my embroidery scissors.

826
01:05:27,268 --> 01:05:30,567
My mother gave them to me
after I married your father.

827
01:05:31,339 --> 01:05:34,672
I used to do all kinds of
things with these.

828
01:05:34,909 --> 01:05:39,278
Did all the quilts.
Made clothes for you kids.

829
01:05:39,514 --> 01:05:42,950
Just... everything.

830
01:05:43,852 --> 01:05:46,343
Then one day they just
up and disappeared.

831
01:05:46,621 --> 01:05:50,352
I looked everywhere,
but I never saw them again.

832
01:05:51,559 --> 01:05:53,117
And yesterday...

833
01:05:53,394 --> 01:05:56,158
...when I was getting
Bud's cuff links...

834
01:05:57,165 --> 01:05:59,929
...I found them in with his stuff.

835
01:06:03,137 --> 01:06:06,732
I have no idea why he wanted them.

836
01:06:06,941 --> 01:06:10,638
Never even thought to
ask him where they were.

837
01:06:10,912 --> 01:06:13,506
Isn't that funny?

838
01:06:14,816 --> 01:06:16,784
I guess so, Mama.

839
01:06:18,152 --> 01:06:22,521
It came to me that your father
is like these scissors.

840
01:06:22,824 --> 01:06:25,793
We didn't lose him on Wednesday.

841
01:06:25,994 --> 01:06:30,488
We lost your father a long,
long time ago.

842
01:06:30,798 --> 01:06:32,959
Did you love him?

843
01:06:38,172 --> 01:06:40,333
Did you love him?

844
01:06:43,611 --> 01:06:46,842
Sometimes I loved him,
sometimes I hated him.

845
01:06:47,115 --> 01:06:49,174
Ray?

846
01:06:49,484 --> 01:06:52,510
Sometime...

847
01:06:52,787 --> 01:06:55,381
...when you least expect it...

848
01:06:55,657 --> 01:06:59,559
...a little door is gonna
open up inside of you.

849
01:07:01,629 --> 01:07:06,532
And you'll feel just fine about
however you feel about your daddy.

850
01:07:06,734 --> 01:07:11,194
'Cause you'll be right.
You'll be able to accept it.

851
01:07:29,657 --> 01:07:33,218
- Good night, Mama. See you tomorrow.
- All right.

852
01:07:42,670 --> 01:07:43,534
Mama?

853
01:07:46,441 --> 01:07:48,204
You sure about that door?

854
01:07:48,776 --> 01:07:50,607
Absolutely positive.

855
01:07:59,287 --> 01:08:01,118
- Lf you need...
- Lucille.

856
01:08:02,023 --> 01:08:06,119
Don't try to fix it.
Let's let it go for a while.

857
01:09:11,192 --> 01:09:14,821
Come on, Delightful.
Royce! Wake up.

858
01:09:15,363 --> 01:09:16,990
Where's Aunt Raynelle?

859
01:09:17,532 --> 01:09:22,367
Why? Are you in a hurry, Devil?
Delightful, come on.

860
01:09:22,637 --> 01:09:24,764
No. None of that today.

861
01:09:25,006 --> 01:09:29,534
And take that gold thing
out your mouth. Delightful, come on!

862
01:09:59,373 --> 01:10:01,841
I can't find my good pants!

863
01:10:57,064 --> 01:10:59,191
Where's the preacher, Mama?

864
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:01,095
What's the rush, Ray?

865
01:11:01,369 --> 01:11:05,135
Antoine and Merline are charging me
by the hour.

866
01:11:05,473 --> 01:11:07,600
Ray, go on and find him.

867
01:11:09,377 --> 01:11:10,639
Sit tight.

868
01:11:38,306 --> 01:11:40,570
- What's he doing?
- He'll be right out.

869
01:11:40,775 --> 01:11:43,801
I'm going broke waiting for him.

870
01:11:44,078 --> 01:11:48,572
Last night the reverend and
Mrs. Hooker went out...

871
01:11:48,816 --> 01:11:51,580
...to that new Mexican restaurant.

872
01:11:51,819 --> 01:11:53,184
- So what?
- Well...

873
01:11:53,421 --> 01:11:56,618
...today he's having
intestinal difficulty.

874
01:11:56,824 --> 01:11:59,452
I swear I'll go in there myself...

875
01:11:59,694 --> 01:12:02,754
...'cause I've had
enough of this shit.

876
01:12:03,030 --> 01:12:05,089
That is a poor choice of words.

877
01:12:05,466 --> 01:12:09,527
My nerves are getting worse
and I don't have my pills.

878
01:12:12,607 --> 01:12:15,303
Just take a deep breath. Come on.

879
01:12:16,143 --> 01:12:18,611
- I'm really trying.
- I know.

880
01:12:22,149 --> 01:12:24,276
I'll take care of it, okay?

881
01:12:32,994 --> 01:12:34,655
Reverend?

882
01:12:36,197 --> 01:12:39,325
Shouldn't be much longer.
You okay?

883
01:12:40,835 --> 01:12:44,066
- When this thing gonna start?
- In a minute!

884
01:12:47,141 --> 01:12:48,233
Charisse?

885
01:12:48,509 --> 01:12:50,409
Honey, where's Junior?

886
01:12:51,746 --> 01:12:55,238
I don't know. Ask Bernice Talbert.

887
01:12:58,319 --> 01:13:02,415
Girl, you so funny.
Do you want some gum?

888
01:13:02,690 --> 01:13:05,557
No, thank you.

889
01:13:05,826 --> 01:13:09,523
I bring sweet gum
to weddings and funerals.

890
01:13:12,533 --> 01:13:16,333
I think the rhythm of it
sort of lulls me.

891
01:13:16,537 --> 01:13:19,335
Helps my mind wander.

892
01:13:21,075 --> 01:13:23,407
You know what I think about?

893
01:13:25,212 --> 01:13:27,237
I'm sure you're gonna tell me.

894
01:13:27,782 --> 01:13:29,545
I think about my life.

895
01:13:29,784 --> 01:13:32,912
How every night I tuck in
my precious boy...

896
01:13:33,387 --> 01:13:35,878
...in my $800,000 home.

897
01:13:36,190 --> 01:13:40,217
And crawl into my king-size bed,
where I lie and wonder...

898
01:13:40,461 --> 01:13:43,259
...where the hell my husband is.

899
01:13:44,065 --> 01:13:45,930
Sure you don't want any?

900
01:13:50,905 --> 01:13:53,305
Why don't you leave him?

901
01:13:53,574 --> 01:13:55,269
And go where?

902
01:13:55,910 --> 01:13:57,969
I have everything I want.

903
01:13:58,379 --> 01:13:59,641
If he loved you...

904
01:13:59,981 --> 01:14:04,645
Then I might be forced
to love him back.

905
01:14:07,321 --> 01:14:10,051
Do you love Junior?

906
01:14:10,925 --> 01:14:13,826
Do you want him back?

907
01:14:14,895 --> 01:14:16,920
You don't have to answer.

908
01:14:17,198 --> 01:14:19,928
Just let the gum take its effect.

909
01:14:20,434 --> 01:14:22,095
It'll come to you.

910
01:14:28,843 --> 01:14:31,004
It's hot in here.

911
01:14:34,281 --> 01:14:36,841
- That's nice!
- Thank you, girl.

912
01:15:06,580 --> 01:15:10,949
First of all, let me apologize
for my tardiness.

913
01:15:11,252 --> 01:15:14,050
I had to call the gas company.

914
01:15:14,288 --> 01:15:18,190
There seemed to be a problem
with one of the pipes.

915
01:15:18,959 --> 01:15:20,517
Shall we pray?

916
01:15:28,969 --> 01:15:31,631
Sorry. Sorry I'm late.

917
01:15:31,872 --> 01:15:35,000
For God's sake, sit down.

918
01:15:35,209 --> 01:15:36,506
Sit down!

919
01:15:42,316 --> 01:15:43,442
Heavenly Father...

920
01:15:44,385 --> 01:15:46,615
...we come here today...

921
01:15:46,821 --> 01:15:48,379
...with heavy hearts.

922
01:15:49,557 --> 01:15:51,889
I'm sorry.

923
01:15:53,394 --> 01:15:57,057
As we mark with sadness
the passing...

924
01:15:57,264 --> 01:16:02,065
...of our dearly departed brother
Bud Slocumb.

925
01:16:08,109 --> 01:16:09,770
Give us peace...

926
01:16:10,010 --> 01:16:12,570
...in our hearts today, Lord.

927
01:16:13,414 --> 01:16:15,075
Guide us...

928
01:16:15,382 --> 01:16:18,977
...through the long night
and help us see...

929
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:23,020
Okay, you need to handle this.
I'm gonna move.

930
01:16:26,193 --> 01:16:29,026
Now, Father...

931
01:16:29,296 --> 01:16:34,029
...let that tomorrow be a
better day than yesterday was.

932
01:16:34,635 --> 01:16:37,001
For what is yesterday...

933
01:16:37,972 --> 01:16:43,035
...but the tomorrow that we
could not face the day before.

934
01:16:55,089 --> 01:16:58,684
But God, with your help...

935
01:17:01,195 --> 01:17:04,289
...we will face it like
we did today.

936
01:17:04,698 --> 01:17:08,862
Tomorrow and all of our
days to come...

937
01:17:09,436 --> 01:17:13,304
...till you call us home
to be with you...

938
01:17:14,108 --> 01:17:17,271
...and our beloved brother Bud.

939
01:17:17,845 --> 01:17:22,873
- Can everybody say, "Amen"?
- Amen.

940
01:17:24,118 --> 01:17:25,949
I love you, Charisse.

941
01:17:28,689 --> 01:17:31,055
Can't you understand that?

942
01:17:38,632 --> 01:17:40,691
I love you.

943
01:17:49,376 --> 01:17:52,675
I guess you thought you could
waltz in here...

944
01:17:53,247 --> 01:17:55,875
...with a Whizzy Cream
and fix everything.

945
01:17:56,417 --> 01:18:01,252
And I would forget
about all the pain and humiliation.

946
01:18:01,722 --> 01:18:02,780
Huh, Junior?

947
01:18:02,990 --> 01:18:06,084
Now, it's your daddy's funeral, okay?

948
01:18:06,827 --> 01:18:10,854
I'm just supposed to welcome
you with open arms and say:

949
01:18:11,065 --> 01:18:13,033
"I forgive you, Junior"?

950
01:18:14,935 --> 01:18:16,061
Well, yeah.

951
01:18:23,777 --> 01:18:25,540
I love you, Junior!

952
01:18:25,779 --> 01:18:28,509
- I love you!
- Why'd you do me like that?

953
01:18:28,716 --> 01:18:30,741
I didn't mean to, baby!

954
01:18:30,951 --> 01:18:33,317
- Why'd you do that?
- I'm sorry!

955
01:18:33,621 --> 01:18:37,557
That's it! That's it!
Get in the pew!

956
01:18:38,626 --> 01:18:41,117
Get your ass in that pew!

957
01:18:42,830 --> 01:18:45,230
Stay there if you want to live!

958
01:18:45,532 --> 01:18:47,159
That's it!

959
01:18:49,370 --> 01:18:51,201
Now...

960
01:18:51,472 --> 01:18:53,372
...is there anything else...

961
01:18:53,641 --> 01:18:58,408
...anyone here needs to say or do?

962
01:19:00,881 --> 01:19:05,750
Does everybody here have
everything they need?

963
01:19:07,187 --> 01:19:10,520
We may be
the laughingstock around here.

964
01:19:10,891 --> 01:19:13,155
But for once in our lives...

965
01:19:13,394 --> 01:19:15,828
...we're gonna do something...

966
01:19:16,497 --> 01:19:18,590
...with class and dignity.

967
01:19:22,936 --> 01:19:25,734
All right, reverend.

968
01:19:26,006 --> 01:19:27,405
Take it away.

969
01:19:30,944 --> 01:19:32,878
Okay, there, Ray.

970
01:19:35,949 --> 01:19:38,008
Ain't God good?

971
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:43,048
I did not know...

972
01:19:43,257 --> 01:19:45,521
...Brother Slocumb well.

973
01:19:46,527 --> 01:19:48,358
But to me...

974
01:19:48,896 --> 01:19:52,297
...he seemed to be a quiet man.

975
01:19:52,566 --> 01:19:55,467
A man of inner strengths...

976
01:19:55,736 --> 01:19:58,432
...and I believe that...

977
01:20:02,710 --> 01:20:07,875
I believe if he was here today...

978
01:20:08,882 --> 01:20:11,976
...he'd send a message to his family.

979
01:20:12,286 --> 01:20:16,916
And the message would simply say...

980
01:20:28,402 --> 01:20:32,202
Would you all mind excusing me
for just a minute?

981
01:20:32,406 --> 01:20:34,306
I'm gonna be right back.

982
01:20:38,078 --> 01:20:40,478
Don't send it over here!

983
01:20:52,192 --> 01:20:55,491
Daddy always was a man of few words.

984
01:21:01,835 --> 01:21:05,293
- I don't care if we have kids.
- What?

985
01:21:05,606 --> 01:21:09,042
It doesn't matter,
you're all I ever wanted.

986
01:21:12,946 --> 01:21:14,937
I hate to stop the party...

987
01:21:15,149 --> 01:21:18,949
...but how we gonna have a funeral
with no pastor?

988
01:21:19,186 --> 01:21:22,280
Sit down. We don't need no pastor.

989
01:21:22,523 --> 01:21:26,516
We've got Ray Bud. Go up there
and say a few things.

990
01:21:27,161 --> 01:21:29,721
Feel that little door opening.

991
01:21:29,997 --> 01:21:32,795
- Say it for us.
- Go on, baby.

992
01:21:49,917 --> 01:21:52,511
Aunt Marguerite, do you wanna?

993
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:55,083
Thank you, Ray.

994
01:21:55,322 --> 01:22:00,021
There seems to be a passage
here in Isaiah that says...

995
01:22:00,694 --> 01:22:05,154
Hey, Ray? What about
that part from Psalms?

996
01:22:05,666 --> 01:22:09,898
The part that goes, "When my father
and mother forsake me...

997
01:22:10,103 --> 01:22:12,162
...the Lord will take me up.

998
01:22:12,773 --> 01:22:16,504
Teach me thy way,
and lead me in a plain path.

999
01:22:16,710 --> 01:22:20,043
Let me see the goodness of the Lord.

1000
01:22:20,347 --> 01:22:25,182
Be of good courage,
and he shall strengthen thine heart.

1001
01:22:25,919 --> 01:22:28,217
Wait, I say, on the Lord."

1002
01:22:34,628 --> 01:22:36,459
You got it, Ray.

1003
01:22:42,603 --> 01:22:45,197
That was real good, Royce.

1004
01:22:54,248 --> 01:22:57,706
I guess this is the part
where I'm supposed to...

1005
01:22:58,619 --> 01:23:02,817
...tell you all how great a man
my father was.

1006
01:23:03,090 --> 01:23:05,058
I'm not gonna do that.

1007
01:23:05,425 --> 01:23:08,724
I'm gonna do what he would've done.

1008
01:23:11,131 --> 01:23:12,962
I'm gonna tell the truth.

1009
01:23:13,166 --> 01:23:16,567
My father was a hard man.

1010
01:23:17,137 --> 01:23:20,834
I'm not judging him,
that's just the facts.

1011
01:23:21,141 --> 01:23:25,601
Daddy wasn't real big on soft words.

1012
01:23:27,748 --> 01:23:30,478
And I know he wasn't good at...

1013
01:23:31,351 --> 01:23:35,014
...expressing what he felt
in his heart.

1014
01:23:35,956 --> 01:23:41,360
So as I stand here today,
I can tell you this.

1015
01:23:43,530 --> 01:23:48,593
If I could do one thing
all over again...

1016
01:23:49,937 --> 01:23:55,273
...I'd tell my father I loved him...

1017
01:23:55,676 --> 01:24:00,704
...instead of waiting my whole life
for him to tell me first.

1018
01:24:04,518 --> 01:24:07,544
So as you step up here today...

1019
01:24:08,689 --> 01:24:11,453
...to say your last goodbye...

1020
01:24:11,992 --> 01:24:15,291
...to Woodrow "Bud" Slocumb...

1021
01:24:17,030 --> 01:24:20,431
...I hope you'll open
the door to your heart.

1022
01:24:20,968 --> 01:24:23,334
I hope you'll take time...

1023
01:24:23,537 --> 01:24:27,633
...to consider the folks
that mean something to you.

1024
01:24:28,275 --> 01:24:31,301
Because people don't last forever.

1025
01:24:32,346 --> 01:24:34,541
They really don't.

1026
01:24:37,618 --> 01:24:40,178
And letting a person in...

1027
01:24:40,454 --> 01:24:44,948
...is the most cherished treasure
this life has to offer.

1028
01:24:46,627 --> 01:24:49,619
So I'm proud to stand here today...

1029
01:24:49,830 --> 01:24:52,526
...and say that in his own way...

1030
01:24:52,766 --> 01:24:55,530
...my father taught me that.

1031
01:24:58,505 --> 01:25:03,670
- Amen.
- Amen.

1032
01:25:09,383 --> 01:25:11,180
We are...

1033
01:25:11,618 --> 01:25:15,782
...truly lucky to have with us today...

1034
01:25:16,256 --> 01:25:18,417
...a member of our family.

1035
01:25:18,625 --> 01:25:22,618
Mrs. Charisse Marie Slocumb...

1036
01:25:22,896 --> 01:25:27,629
...who will honor her
father-in-law in song.

1037
01:25:27,901 --> 01:25:29,732
Charisse.

1038
01:25:34,041 --> 01:25:36,407
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Ray.

1039
01:25:38,078 --> 01:25:41,377
I haven't sang in a long time.

1040
01:25:45,352 --> 01:25:48,685
I know y'all know this,
so sing along.

1041
01:27:48,842 --> 01:27:53,006
You were wonderful.
Baby, that was good!

1042
01:27:56,149 --> 01:28:00,381
Daddy, I know you always
worried about me and the kids...

1043
01:28:00,654 --> 01:28:03,817
...but you don't have to
anymore, because...

1044
01:28:04,491 --> 01:28:08,825
Charisse's going into the music
business. I'll be her manager.

1045
01:28:09,029 --> 01:28:10,894
- You think?
- Oh, I think.

1046
01:28:19,272 --> 01:28:23,538
- Sure does look peaceful, don't he?
- Yes, he does.

1047
01:28:23,743 --> 01:28:29,010
Daddy Bud, in about seven
and half months from now...

1048
01:28:29,216 --> 01:28:31,946
...you might get a little surprise.

1049
01:28:32,686 --> 01:28:35,086
We'll name a boy Buddy Ray...

1050
01:28:35,355 --> 01:28:38,222
...and we'll name a girl Budeisha Joy.

1051
01:28:38,425 --> 01:28:41,553
But don't get your hopes
up too high yet.

1052
01:28:42,462 --> 01:28:44,054
Bye, Daddy.

1053
01:28:55,375 --> 01:28:58,936
Royce, when I go, just
put me in a pine box.

1054
01:28:59,145 --> 01:29:03,479
Don't spend any money on me.
Not that you'll have any.

1055
01:29:04,217 --> 01:29:06,378
Mama, when the time comes...

1056
01:29:06,620 --> 01:29:11,080
...try to point your toes down like
Uncle Bud did.

1057
01:29:11,391 --> 01:29:14,758
So I can bury you with a pile driver.

1058
01:29:14,995 --> 01:29:19,295
- You're a demon, Royce.
- I'm your demon, Mama.

1059
01:29:42,822 --> 01:29:44,289
Royce, come on...

1060
01:29:45,458 --> 01:29:47,653
No, you didn't!

1061
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:59,336
If it starts to get crowded up there,
save a place for me.

1062
01:29:59,673 --> 01:30:01,698
But not too soon.

1063
01:30:25,000 --> 01:34:39,000
