1
00:01:08,258 --> 00:01:11,750
My name is Sung Neng Yee.

2
00:01:11,862 --> 00:01:14,558
This is my story.

3
00:01:14,664 --> 00:01:16,655
You may not believe it all,

4
00:01:16,766 --> 00:01:19,667
but I lived every moment...

5
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:21,794
and more.

6
00:01:31,481 --> 00:01:32,914
The years of my childhood

7
00:01:33,016 --> 00:01:37,146
were like a beautiful dream.

8
00:01:37,254 --> 00:01:40,746
I was a princess...

9
00:01:40,857 --> 00:01:44,258
Spoiled, pampered.

10
00:01:44,361 --> 00:01:47,387
Reigning over my every whim.

11
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:09,444
When the Japanese overran all of Shanghai,

12
00:02:09,553 --> 00:02:12,351
they discovered my private kingdom.

13
00:02:13,523 --> 00:02:21,157
[war planes flying overhead]

14
00:02:50,227 --> 00:04:06,628
[music]

15
00:04:06,736 --> 00:04:15,804
[sounds of truck engines doors slamming,

16
00:04:15,912 --> 00:04:18,073
and soldiers running]

17
00:04:19,182 --> 00:04:20,877
Mama!

18
00:04:33,196 --> 00:04:35,096
[Asian talking]

19
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:50,476
[crashing sounds]

20
00:04:51,548 --> 00:04:53,812
Mama... I'm afraid.

21
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,623
[people crying]

22
00:05:04,427 --> 00:05:06,895
[Asian talking]

23
00:05:38,161 --> 00:05:48,833
[People screaming and crying]

24
00:05:53,042 --> 00:05:56,534
(NENG YEE) War stole my privileged childhood.

25
00:05:56,646 --> 00:06:00,605
It was gone like a leaf on the wind.

26
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:15,864
[firecrackers] bang, bang, bang

27
00:06:21,271 --> 00:06:23,569
(NENG YEE) In the Chinese way of counting,

28
00:06:23,673 --> 00:06:27,404
1950 was the Year of the Tiger.

29
00:06:35,485 --> 00:06:40,684
After such a long period of mind-defying
violence.

30
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:44,521
we were grateful to be alive and free.

31
00:06:47,397 --> 00:06:49,365
(DR. SUNG) What is the matter? Are you cold?

32
00:06:49,466 --> 00:06:52,867
(MRS. SUNG) Firecrackers..they've lost their
magic.

33
00:06:52,969 --> 00:06:55,062
Too much like gunfire!

34
00:06:55,171 --> 00:06:57,696
Cheer up. Look for Neng Yee.

35
00:06:57,807 --> 00:07:00,139
She said she would be near the dragon.

36
00:07:10,286 --> 00:07:14,245
(NENG YEE) The Red flag seemed
China's hope for the future.

37
00:07:22,932 --> 00:07:25,127
(NENG YEE) My parents... I'm home.

38
00:07:25,235 --> 00:07:28,204
Your daughter sends you love and best wishes

39
00:07:28,304 --> 00:07:29,532
for the New Year!

40
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,607
Is this how it is going to be with you?

41
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:32,606
What, Mama?

42
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:34,836
This marching business?

43
00:07:34,944 --> 00:07:37,970
The Communists are Chinese.

44
00:07:38,081 --> 00:07:40,106
They have returned our country to us.

45
00:07:40,216 --> 00:07:44,676
We must show respect. Come, I have presents...

46
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,591
(CHUNG SHIN) Did you have self-criticism
this morning?

47
00:07:59,702 --> 00:08:00,760
(NENG YEE) Of course!

48
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,098
(LING MEI) Did you stand up?

49
00:08:02,205 --> 00:08:03,467
Well, I couldn't think of anything really good

50
00:08:03,573 --> 00:08:05,837
so I promised to never wear lipstick again.

51
00:08:05,942 --> 00:08:07,307
Were you sincere?

52
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:09,105
I was this morning.

53
00:08:09,212 --> 00:08:10,110
[laughter] ha, ha, ha!

54
00:08:11,047 --> 00:08:12,344
I'm starving!

55
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,111
I heard the Communists have actually stopped

56
00:08:19,222 --> 00:08:21,782
all business on Euzhow Road.

57
00:08:21,891 --> 00:08:23,483
The red-light district?

58
00:08:23,593 --> 00:08:27,290
What about all the Singsong girls?

59
00:08:27,397 --> 00:08:30,525
They will be re-educated, of course!

60
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:31,725
I don't think they excel

61
00:08:31,834 --> 00:08:34,667
because of their intellectual ability!

62
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:42,970
Oh, boy! Western clothes!

63
00:08:43,646 --> 00:08:46,979
An upperclassman... Lam Cheng Shen.

64
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,175
Hong Kong money.

65
00:08:48,284 --> 00:08:49,649
His family is very rich.

66
00:08:52,355 --> 00:08:54,220
Handsome, too.

67
00:08:54,324 --> 00:08:57,122
I'd forgotten men could look like that.

68
00:08:57,226 --> 00:08:58,625
Forget it!

69
00:08:58,728 --> 00:09:02,129
He's never dated anyone at school.

70
00:09:02,231 --> 00:09:03,926
A real loner...

71
00:09:06,869 --> 00:09:08,700
Give me a few weeks.

72
00:09:08,805 --> 00:09:11,035
I can change that.

73
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,539
You wouldn't dare!

74
00:09:12,642 --> 00:09:15,304
A dinner date... within the month.

75
00:09:15,411 --> 00:09:17,606
Trapped by your own words.

76
00:09:17,714 --> 00:09:20,012
So bourgeois!

77
00:09:20,116 --> 00:09:21,549
If you lose, big mouth,

78
00:09:21,651 --> 00:09:25,052
you have to do my homework papers
for a month!

79
00:09:25,154 --> 00:09:28,180
I'll get him to take me somewhere.

80
00:10:01,457 --> 00:10:03,925
The duties of a mother.

81
00:10:07,096 --> 00:10:08,723
You have money to gamble, Mama.

82
00:10:08,831 --> 00:10:10,458
Where did you get it?

83
00:10:10,566 --> 00:10:16,402
It is not appropriate for you to question me.

84
00:10:16,506 --> 00:10:20,909
Where? Tell me.

85
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:26,107
An old silk scarf. Just a memento.

86
00:10:26,215 --> 00:10:28,046
We haggled over it for an hour.

87
00:10:28,151 --> 00:10:32,019
We got a good price. That was fun!

88
00:10:32,121 --> 00:10:38,526
Tell me, daughter, where would I wear
it in these times.

89
00:10:38,628 --> 00:10:41,688
Hopelessly out-of-fashion!

90
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:50,433
Perhaps we should have left China.

91
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:54,704
I should have taken you out when
the Japanese were defeated.

92
00:10:54,811 --> 00:10:55,573
Nonsense!

93
00:10:55,678 --> 00:10:58,977
Who would have expected it to
go this way?

94
00:10:59,082 --> 00:11:00,845
Look!

95
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:03,919
I will be a big potato for the Communists.

96
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,386
You just watch, Okay?

97
00:11:06,489 --> 00:11:08,013
If the front door is locked,

98
00:11:08,124 --> 00:11:10,183
I'll go in through the back.

99
00:11:10,293 --> 00:11:13,490
You were not raised to be a "potato!"

100
00:11:13,596 --> 00:11:15,530
What a common expression.

101
00:11:23,773 --> 00:11:37,915
[talking on a bull horn]

102
00:11:46,295 --> 00:11:48,923
[whistle blows]

103
00:11:59,909 --> 00:12:03,606
[whistle blows]

104
00:12:08,217 --> 00:12:10,242
Neng!

105
00:12:28,704 --> 00:12:32,640
Look! His name. Lam Cheng Shen.

106
00:12:32,742 --> 00:12:34,903
"Volunteers are requested on Saturday

107
00:12:35,011 --> 00:12:37,070
to clean-up the grounds.

108
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,547
Please do your duty for the betterment
of all."

109
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:43,278
Not on Saturday. Not me.

110
00:12:43,386 --> 00:12:46,082
I have a paper that is due.

111
00:12:46,189 --> 00:12:47,713
It is important to volunteer.

112
00:12:47,824 --> 00:12:50,384
We must show the proper spirit!

113
00:13:21,891 --> 00:13:25,292
Excuse me.

114
00:13:25,394 --> 00:13:28,386
Do you need help here?

115
00:13:28,497 --> 00:13:31,398
I have completed my assignment.

116
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,196
(CHENG SHEN) No, thank you.
I am nearly finished.

117
00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:42,336
I have heard it said that our great
Chairman Mao

118
00:13:42,445 --> 00:13:45,972
does not approve of flowers for
the new China.

119
00:13:49,452 --> 00:13:52,751
Perhaps he prefers weeds.

120
00:13:55,558 --> 00:13:59,585
We had beautiful flower gardens when
I was a child.

121
00:14:24,353 --> 00:14:26,685
These were cut by mistake.

122
00:14:26,789 --> 00:14:31,522
It seemed a waste to see them tossed
with the weeds.

123
00:14:31,627 --> 00:14:34,824
We have not been properly introduced,
I apologize.

124
00:15:05,061 --> 00:15:07,427
What is it?

125
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:10,090
Homework.

126
00:16:15,231 --> 00:16:17,062
Yes?

127
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,997
Do you live here?

128
00:16:19,101 --> 00:16:22,969
What a surprise.

129
00:16:23,072 --> 00:16:27,475
I'm just selling concert tickets to benefit
poor children.

130
00:16:27,576 --> 00:16:29,601
Chopin.

131
00:16:29,712 --> 00:16:32,374
I just knock on any door.

132
00:16:32,481 --> 00:16:34,381
Chopin.

133
00:16:34,483 --> 00:16:38,249
I'm sorry-- I'm leaving for Hong Kong.

134
00:16:38,354 --> 00:16:40,686
Oh, but the concert is two weeks away.

135
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,623
You will return in time.

136
00:16:43,726 --> 00:16:49,562
I mean, surely you wouldn't miss
two full weeks of classes.

137
00:16:49,665 --> 00:16:52,600
Your tickets-- are they expensive?

138
00:16:52,701 --> 00:16:55,898
I have a wonderful plan.

139
00:16:56,005 --> 00:16:59,406
Nylon stockings have disappeared
from Shanghai.

140
00:16:59,508 --> 00:17:02,671
If you would consider making a purchase
for me in Hong Kong.

141
00:17:02,778 --> 00:17:04,905
I would be most grateful.

142
00:17:05,014 --> 00:17:07,141
And in return for your kindness

143
00:17:07,249 --> 00:17:10,013
I will purchase two seats for the concert.

144
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:12,679
The tickets will not cost you anything!

145
00:17:12,788 --> 00:17:14,949
That should be enough.

146
00:17:15,057 --> 00:17:18,220
You are asking me to buy nylon stockings?

147
00:17:18,327 --> 00:17:20,488
If it is not a problem for you,

148
00:17:20,596 --> 00:17:23,724
I would be most pleased.

149
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:32,235
I suppose we should eat first.

150
00:17:32,341 --> 00:17:36,038
Dinner and a concert.

151
00:17:36,145 --> 00:17:38,340
It almost sounds like a "date."

152
00:17:41,417 --> 00:17:42,782
Thank you.

153
00:17:42,885 --> 00:17:45,046
You're welcome.

154
00:17:45,154 --> 00:17:50,820
It won't be expensive. I don't eat much.

155
00:17:57,099 --> 00:18:00,398
Hey, do you always carry so much money

156
00:18:00,503 --> 00:18:03,563
when you go shopping?

157
00:18:09,311 --> 00:18:10,710
Yahoo!!

158
00:18:39,842 --> 00:18:42,504
Your father is late. Something has
happened.

159
00:18:42,611 --> 00:18:44,511
It takes longer now, Mama.

160
00:18:44,613 --> 00:18:47,081
It is not the bicycle.

161
00:18:47,183 --> 00:18:51,347
It was the raven at the kitchen
this morning.

162
00:18:51,453 --> 00:18:54,320
Listen, Mama, you worry for nothing.

163
00:18:54,423 --> 00:18:57,051
Don't use that patronizing tone!

164
00:18:57,159 --> 00:18:58,956
I can read the signs.

165
00:18:59,061 --> 00:19:00,790
I'm going to see Shek Tong Ting.

166
00:19:00,896 --> 00:19:02,887
She'll convince you.

167
00:19:08,137 --> 00:19:14,565
(MRS. SUNG) He was born before dawn
on September 1 1. 1900.

168
00:19:28,324 --> 00:19:34,422
A dark cloud hangs over him at this moment!

169
00:19:40,569 --> 00:19:43,231
Now do you believe me?

170
00:20:01,557 --> 00:20:04,390
(SOLDIER'S VOICE) You have brought
deep shame to China...

171
00:20:04,493 --> 00:20:06,825
our soldiers are sickened to touch you

172
00:20:06,929 --> 00:20:11,764
or of your flesh from the decadent past...

173
00:20:16,338 --> 00:20:17,828
She is soft under her sweater.

174
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,464
Like a young pigeon.

175
00:20:19,575 --> 00:20:23,875
Let go! You animal! Get away from me!

176
00:20:23,979 --> 00:20:26,140
What is it?

177
00:20:26,248 --> 00:20:28,739
She was escaping, Comrade.

178
00:20:33,689 --> 00:20:38,752
You do not look like a Singsong girl.

179
00:20:38,861 --> 00:20:42,888
My father is a very important doctor

180
00:20:42,998 --> 00:20:46,559
at Hwa Tung Textile Hospital.

181
00:20:46,669 --> 00:20:49,968
He did not come home for the evening meal.

182
00:20:50,072 --> 00:20:55,100
Your men detained me, Lieutenant,

183
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:59,772
on my way to see what emergency has
kept him from his family.

184
00:21:13,162 --> 00:21:17,258
Perhaps my men were over zealous.

185
00:21:17,366 --> 00:21:21,132
Our apologies, Sung Neng Yee.

186
00:21:21,236 --> 00:21:23,830
May I go now?

187
00:21:23,939 --> 00:21:26,999
Of course, but it is not wise

188
00:21:27,109 --> 00:21:29,475
to travel alone at night.

189
00:21:29,578 --> 00:21:33,207
Shanghai still contains many dark elements.

190
00:21:33,315 --> 00:21:37,251
It will take time to eradicate them all.

191
00:21:37,353 --> 00:21:41,221
Thank you, Lieutenant.

192
00:21:41,323 --> 00:21:44,053
Please my card.

193
00:21:51,367 --> 00:21:55,394
(SOLDIER'S VOICE) Seek the forgiveness of
our great Chairman Mao.

194
00:21:55,504 --> 00:22:00,942
or you will be cast aside as worthless
and empty-headed.

195
00:22:13,055 --> 00:22:15,216
Excuse me... I am the daughter of Dr. Sung.

196
00:22:15,324 --> 00:22:17,622
Is my father still on duty?

197
00:22:17,726 --> 00:22:21,662
Dr. Sung? He is not known to me.

198
00:22:21,764 --> 00:22:24,164
Not known to you? Impossible!

199
00:22:24,266 --> 00:22:26,598
He has practiced here for years.

200
00:22:26,702 --> 00:22:29,933
This hospital has many new doctors.

201
00:22:30,038 --> 00:22:33,735
You are inquiring about Dr. Sung?

202
00:22:33,842 --> 00:22:36,333
Where is he?

203
00:22:50,392 --> 00:22:52,121
Papa!

204
00:22:59,501 --> 00:23:01,230
You should not be here, Neng Yee!

205
00:23:01,336 --> 00:23:04,066
No, please!

206
00:23:04,173 --> 00:23:06,767
Papa, what are they doing to you?

207
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:10,106
I am under "the submission of the people."

208
00:23:10,212 --> 00:23:13,272
Go home.

209
00:23:17,986 --> 00:23:21,422
Dr. Sung is a "clean man!" A patriot!

210
00:23:21,523 --> 00:23:23,047
He loves his country...

211
00:23:23,158 --> 00:23:24,819
No! No! Shut your mouth!

212
00:23:24,927 --> 00:23:28,363
You will only make it worse for Dr. Sung!

213
00:23:38,707 --> 00:23:43,144
Over population and modern technology

214
00:23:43,245 --> 00:23:47,045
are capitalism's own seeds of self-destruction.

215
00:23:47,149 --> 00:23:50,710
Eventually, machines will replace people

216
00:23:50,819 --> 00:23:58,487
in all professions and the masses
will forget how to work.

217
00:23:58,594 --> 00:24:02,792
Their societies will collapse from within.

218
00:24:02,898 --> 00:24:06,732
That is why every citizen of China

219
00:24:06,835 --> 00:24:15,368
must experience labor training.

220
00:24:15,477 --> 00:24:23,475
The time is near when we will be classless

221
00:24:23,585 --> 00:24:28,318
a nation of laborists.

222
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,987
You have something to say?

223
00:24:41,603 --> 00:24:43,002
Excuse me, sir,

224
00:24:43,105 --> 00:24:45,938
what provision is being made
to protect the rights

225
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:48,066
of the innocent--

226
00:24:48,176 --> 00:24:53,011
those who have been or will be
unjustly accused.

227
00:24:56,852 --> 00:25:00,754
Chairman Mao has repeatedly told us,

228
00:25:00,856 --> 00:25:06,658
"A revolution is not a dinner party!"

229
00:25:06,762 --> 00:25:09,697
Identify yourself!

230
00:25:32,521 --> 00:25:35,354
Tell me about your parents.

231
00:25:35,457 --> 00:25:38,483
Why?

232
00:25:38,594 --> 00:25:43,031
'Cause, they are your family!

233
00:25:43,131 --> 00:25:47,534
Well-- my mother has small feet--

234
00:25:47,636 --> 00:25:50,764
exceptionally small feet.

235
00:25:50,872 --> 00:25:54,740
My father has numerous concubines,

236
00:25:54,843 --> 00:25:59,280
and I don't know how many half brothers
and sisters I have.

237
00:25:59,381 --> 00:26:03,249
Is that all you can say?

238
00:26:03,352 --> 00:26:09,814
Isn't that enough?

239
00:26:09,925 --> 00:26:17,832
I think you have built high walls
about your life.

240
00:26:17,933 --> 00:26:23,303
Are you a student of Psychiatry now?

241
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:57,304
She really did it!

242
00:27:17,259 --> 00:28:18,312
[piano music]

243
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:21,218
Will you remove those ugly posters
when we are gone?

244
00:28:21,323 --> 00:28:23,985
Your father stole large sums of money
from the hospital.

245
00:28:24,092 --> 00:28:27,323
His crime is against the people.

246
00:28:27,429 --> 00:28:29,021
The truth must be published.

247
00:28:29,131 --> 00:28:30,792
Lies can be published too!

248
00:28:30,899 --> 00:28:34,266
The witnesses agreed. It is a matter
of record.

249
00:28:34,369 --> 00:28:36,860
You have no confession from Dr. Sung!

250
00:28:36,972 --> 00:28:40,635
Neng Yee! It is enough.

251
00:29:35,297 --> 00:29:38,391
(NENG YEE) Our family's humiliation
was eased

252
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:45,702
when I graduated with honors from
Soochow University--

253
00:29:45,807 --> 00:29:51,302
the third highest in my class!

254
00:29:51,413 --> 00:29:52,971
The Communist professors could not

255
00:29:53,081 --> 00:29:55,311
ignore my achievements.

256
00:29:55,417 --> 00:30:00,650
I had forced their respect.
It was exhilarating.

257
00:30:08,063 --> 00:30:09,894
My daughter tells me that you have been

258
00:30:09,998 --> 00:30:11,863
a great help with her studies.

259
00:30:11,967 --> 00:30:14,697
I doubt that she needed my assistance.

260
00:30:14,803 --> 00:30:17,829
I may have met your mother
before the war--

261
00:30:17,939 --> 00:30:19,964
at the French Club.

262
00:30:20,075 --> 00:30:21,406
It is possible.

263
00:30:21,509 --> 00:30:24,239
My mother found pleasure in gambling.

264
00:30:24,346 --> 00:30:27,804
Oh, I wish we could go there now
and celebrate.

265
00:30:27,916 --> 00:30:31,511
Why? You would like to dine with ghosts?

266
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:35,647
Well, if only ghosts came
they would not charge us

267
00:30:35,757 --> 00:30:38,248
for the meal, would they!

268
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,294
Do you always see friends to the door?

269
00:30:48,403 --> 00:30:51,839
Special days should never end.

270
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:55,432
Why did you tell your parents I helped you
with your studies?

271
00:30:55,543 --> 00:30:58,535
I just wanted them to be in your debt.

272
00:30:58,647 --> 00:31:03,050
But for what purpose?

273
00:31:03,151 --> 00:31:09,351
Couldn't we go inside?

274
00:31:09,457 --> 00:31:11,857
The walls have ears.

275
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:15,691
I share the flat with two other families.

276
00:31:32,347 --> 00:31:39,719
[music]

277
00:32:22,797 --> 00:32:52,185
[soldiers chanting]

278
00:32:52,293 --> 00:32:53,453
Let's go.

279
00:32:53,561 --> 00:32:55,756
The old palace is just up the road.

280
00:32:55,864 --> 00:32:57,991
The Governess used to take me

281
00:32:58,099 --> 00:33:02,433
for very controlled walks along this street.

282
00:33:02,537 --> 00:33:05,335
Tuesday afternoons and Friday mornings.

283
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,704
We were always on schedule.

284
00:33:07,809 --> 00:33:09,970
A "controlled walk?" What's that?

285
00:33:10,078 --> 00:33:12,046
Shirley and I were in the wagon.

286
00:33:12,147 --> 00:33:14,911
The Governess was forced to pull!

287
00:33:15,016 --> 00:33:16,916
Shirley? Who's Shirley?

288
00:33:17,018 --> 00:33:21,546
She was an American movie star
about my age.

289
00:33:24,626 --> 00:33:26,423
It was bombed during the war,

290
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:28,860
but completely restored.

291
00:33:28,963 --> 00:33:33,400
I'm glad they didn't change it.

292
00:33:33,501 --> 00:33:36,163
A big general lives there now.

293
00:33:36,271 --> 00:33:38,262
You always find a joke in everything.

294
00:33:44,979 --> 00:33:59,258
[Classical piano music]

295
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,328
[Upbeat piano music]

296
00:34:01,963 --> 00:34:03,828
Boogie Woogie!

297
00:34:24,452 --> 00:34:44,567
[romantic music]

298
00:35:22,844 --> 00:35:24,505
Happy smile!

299
00:35:34,956 --> 00:35:42,658
[laughter and giggles]

300
00:35:43,331 --> 00:35:46,494
Kissing in the new China is not only in
questionable taste

301
00:35:46,601 --> 00:35:48,933
but quite possible unhealthy.

302
00:35:49,037 --> 00:35:51,198
That was in the paper this morning.

303
00:35:51,306 --> 00:35:54,833
Doesn't that depend on the parties involved?

304
00:35:54,943 --> 00:35:57,912
Ouch! I just laid on a rock.

305
00:35:58,012 --> 00:36:01,175
It's not a rock! It's an egg.

306
00:36:01,282 --> 00:36:03,409
Two dozen, I think.

307
00:36:03,518 --> 00:36:07,716
It's an old custom to bring us luck.

308
00:36:07,822 --> 00:36:09,722
Did they have to be red?

309
00:36:09,824 --> 00:36:12,884
It's the color of fertility.

310
00:36:12,994 --> 00:36:16,157
They've already worked their magic.

311
00:36:16,264 --> 00:36:19,495
We'll have them for breakfast.

312
00:36:19,601 --> 00:36:23,503
Neng Yee, Promise me something.

313
00:36:23,605 --> 00:36:26,233
Anything...

314
00:36:26,341 --> 00:36:29,868
Teach our son to laugh!

315
00:36:30,712 --> 00:36:32,680
[laughter] ha, ha, ha

316
00:36:38,152 --> 00:36:42,987
My name is Lam Neng Yee.

317
00:36:43,091 --> 00:36:45,423
I have been given the opportunity of teaching you

318
00:36:45,526 --> 00:36:50,054
two courses-- History and Political Science.

319
00:36:50,164 --> 00:36:51,654
You have been selected to study here

320
00:36:51,766 --> 00:36:56,100
because you are all brilliant soldiers.

321
00:36:56,204 --> 00:36:58,638
Now our government is giving you
the opportunity

322
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:01,834
to be brilliant scholars, as well.

323
00:37:01,943 --> 00:37:04,878
This will be an intensified course.

324
00:37:04,979 --> 00:37:08,244
You will gain six years of knowledge
in three!

325
00:37:20,862 --> 00:37:22,591
But I have instruction now.

326
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:56,957
As a matter of policy

327
00:37:57,065 --> 00:38:01,001
all teachers here are being examined.

328
00:38:01,102 --> 00:38:04,128
How is that possible, Colonel?

329
00:38:09,344 --> 00:38:12,836
Why did you family stay in Shanghai

330
00:38:12,947 --> 00:38:14,278
when your relatives were fleeing

331
00:38:14,382 --> 00:38:18,478
with their personal fortunes?

332
00:38:18,586 --> 00:38:21,316
When the stock market collapsed

333
00:38:21,422 --> 00:38:25,290
and all money was converted to Japanese yen

334
00:38:25,393 --> 00:38:29,727
we became refugees in out own city.

335
00:38:29,831 --> 00:38:35,133
But still my father would not leave China!

336
00:38:35,236 --> 00:38:38,137
May I please have some water?

337
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,342
At what age did your parents enroll you

338
00:38:50,451 --> 00:38:55,753
in the McTyler Christian School?

339
00:38:55,857 --> 00:38:58,587
Nine or ten, I'm not certain.

340
00:38:58,693 --> 00:39:01,560
Why did they send you to
a missionary school?

341
00:39:01,662 --> 00:39:05,098
I don't know...

342
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:09,067
for the instruction.

343
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:12,662
Isn't it logical to suggest that they did this

344
00:39:12,774 --> 00:39:16,437
because they had strong
Christian sympathies?

345
00:39:16,544 --> 00:39:20,446
They are not religious.

346
00:39:20,548 --> 00:39:24,040
My father had some Catholic instruction
in France.

347
00:39:24,152 --> 00:39:27,144
but I've never known him to pray.

348
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:33,657
And then after the war you were enrolled

349
00:39:33,761 --> 00:39:37,458
in a boarding school-- also Christian.

350
00:39:37,565 --> 00:39:40,534
The Mary Farham School.
It was Presbyterian.

351
00:39:40,635 --> 00:39:45,197
It rated very high academically.

352
00:39:45,306 --> 00:39:48,833
Is that when you became a Christian?

353
00:39:48,943 --> 00:39:52,208
I was young... impressionable.

354
00:39:52,313 --> 00:39:54,679
It didn't stick!

355
00:39:54,782 --> 00:39:58,274
It was just something you did
when you were in school.

356
00:39:58,386 --> 00:40:02,550
Why do these questions make you
uncomfortable?

357
00:40:02,657 --> 00:40:05,353
My baby resists sitting so long.

358
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,859
She married a man from Hong Kong.

359
00:40:06,961 --> 00:40:08,428
He brought her nylon stockings.

360
00:40:08,529 --> 00:40:13,228
He smuggled them into China.

361
00:40:13,334 --> 00:40:16,770
Thank you.

362
00:40:16,871 --> 00:40:22,104
Smuggling is a serious offense.

363
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:26,977
This will take consideration.

364
00:40:27,081 --> 00:40:31,814
First, write about your life at
the Mary Farnham School.

365
00:40:31,919 --> 00:40:36,913
Reconsider every event in your time
with the Presbyterians.

366
00:40:37,024 --> 00:40:39,720
You must return all paper that is used.

367
00:40:39,827 --> 00:40:44,730
Even the false starts.

368
00:40:49,437 --> 00:40:55,842
But my family, My baby--
I must go home.

369
00:40:55,943 --> 00:40:59,674
Consider this a chapter in
your autobiography.

370
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,748
The more you write,

371
00:41:01,849 --> 00:41:04,875
the sooner this matter will be closed.

372
00:41:16,163 --> 00:41:17,892
(NENG YEE Speaking) In China,

373
00:41:17,999 --> 00:41:23,232
the family name gives meaning to a person.

374
00:41:23,337 --> 00:41:29,936
I write this with true awareness that
the history of my family

375
00:41:30,044 --> 00:41:35,448
is of deeper importance than
who I have become.

376
00:41:37,952 --> 00:41:42,651
After the defeat of the Japanese in 1945,

377
00:41:42,757 --> 00:41:46,420
my father brought us back to
our beloved Shanghai.

378
00:41:46,527 --> 00:41:49,428
I was 13 years old...

379
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:57,597
Many of my classmates wore gold crosses
about their necks

380
00:41:57,705 --> 00:42:01,539
I did not want to say that I was not
a Christian

381
00:42:01,642 --> 00:42:04,668
so I told them I was saving my neck

382
00:42:04,779 --> 00:42:09,239
for a string of perfectly-matched pearls!

383
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:11,682
At first I had difficulty keeping pace

384
00:42:11,786 --> 00:42:14,550
with my classmates.

385
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:20,184
The teachers often spoke of the Bible
and Jesus Christ

386
00:42:20,294 --> 00:42:23,422
in a most natural way.

387
00:42:23,531 --> 00:42:28,434
As if He were more than a
historical figure.

388
00:42:28,536 --> 00:42:33,371
I found this puzzling, but I dismissed it.

389
00:42:33,474 --> 00:42:36,910
My studies demanded all my attention.

390
00:42:40,381 --> 00:42:46,081
Your writing is too specific.

391
00:42:46,187 --> 00:42:49,748
As if you were hiding something.

392
00:42:53,628 --> 00:42:59,260
Fiction can perhaps be more
rambling in style.

393
00:42:59,367 --> 00:43:01,426
I am not a writer of fiction!

394
00:43:06,774 --> 00:43:08,901
(NENG YEE Speaking) A self-criticism
and confession

395
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:11,638
are the first steps to social reform,

396
00:43:11,746 --> 00:43:14,647
I will attempt to explain my involvement
with Christianity

397
00:43:14,749 --> 00:43:19,243
at this impressionable age.

398
00:43:19,353 --> 00:43:25,588
It began like a tiny seed planted
in my spirit.

399
00:43:25,693 --> 00:43:32,565
I was away from my parents and
lonely for something.

400
00:43:32,667 --> 00:43:38,469
Living God, can you hear me?

401
00:43:38,572 --> 00:43:43,134
Please help me claim You as my friend.

402
00:43:57,491 --> 00:43:59,789
(NENG YEE Speaking) At a time of
personal stress.

403
00:43:59,894 --> 00:44:03,330
I did profess to be a Christian.

404
00:44:03,431 --> 00:44:04,955
It was the night before we faced

405
00:44:05,066 --> 00:44:08,433
the Middle School entrance exams.

406
00:44:08,536 --> 00:44:10,731
The strong emphasis on high test scores

407
00:44:10,838 --> 00:44:14,467
made me apprehensive.

408
00:44:16,644 --> 00:44:35,053
[singing]

409
00:44:38,399 --> 00:44:41,596
(NENG YEE Speaking) By the time
I reached 16 years.

410
00:44:41,702 --> 00:44:46,264
the Christian God was forgotten.

411
00:44:46,373 --> 00:44:49,274
I now look to our great Chairman Mao

412
00:44:49,376 --> 00:44:52,402
for instruction and guidance!

413
00:46:02,016 --> 00:46:05,884
Religion will ultimately disappear
from human history.

414
00:46:05,986 --> 00:46:10,514
But it will be a slow process
of re-education.

415
00:46:10,624 --> 00:46:14,526
Old ideologies and cultural habits
from the past

416
00:46:14,628 --> 00:46:19,190
cannot be eliminated in one generation.

417
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:25,705
The era of pure Communism is a prize
for the future.

418
00:46:25,806 --> 00:46:32,609
That will be China's millennium!

419
00:46:32,713 --> 00:46:36,376
For now, it must be determined

420
00:46:36,483 --> 00:46:42,718
if you are worthy to assist us in our goals.

421
00:46:42,823 --> 00:46:45,951
Will it always be unfair like this?

422
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:51,794
Perhaps you should write again
in more detail!

423
00:46:55,469 --> 00:46:59,371
I am about to give birth, Colonel.

424
00:46:59,473 --> 00:47:02,636
My baby needs adequate rest.

425
00:47:02,743 --> 00:47:06,474
The softness of your past is most evident.

426
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:10,641
You are preparing your baby for life!

427
00:48:03,404 --> 00:48:09,001
I talked to You when I was a child.

428
00:48:09,109 --> 00:48:11,703
Do You remember my name?

429
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:54,483
Comrade, good evening.

430
00:48:54,588 --> 00:48:56,385
I am hoping to request a small favor.

431
00:48:56,490 --> 00:49:00,051
You see, I have a friend who teaches here.

432
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,957
We had a terrible argument.

433
00:49:02,062 --> 00:49:04,462
I need to see her to patch things up.

434
00:49:04,565 --> 00:49:07,625
Classes are completed for today.

435
00:49:07,735 --> 00:49:10,203
My friend is a serious Party member-
very dedicated.

436
00:49:10,304 --> 00:49:12,636
Hours mean nothing to her.

437
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:15,106
In fact, that's why she keeps me waiting.

438
00:49:15,209 --> 00:49:17,040
Her name is Lang Neng Yee.
If you could check...

439
00:49:17,144 --> 00:49:19,772
The Admissions Office opens at 8 o'clock.

440
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,677
Passes are issued there!

441
00:49:26,687 --> 00:49:30,817
How can you sleep so late?

442
00:49:30,924 --> 00:49:34,621
An indulgence of the lazy capitalist class.

443
00:49:34,728 --> 00:49:39,791
The revolutionary masses have been
at work for hours.

444
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:42,391
The Colonel is not here?

445
00:49:42,503 --> 00:49:47,702
He has more important duties.

446
00:49:47,808 --> 00:49:53,610
May I please request some water?

447
00:49:53,714 --> 00:49:56,205
Just a glass of water.

448
00:49:56,316 --> 00:50:01,652
You must learn self-discipline.

449
00:50:01,755 --> 00:50:04,656
I have nothing further to confess.

450
00:50:04,758 --> 00:50:06,817
We will help you to remember.

451
00:50:07,694 --> 00:50:09,423
[Chinese command]

452
00:50:14,468 --> 00:50:15,833
We demand a full confession

453
00:50:15,936 --> 00:50:20,100
of your counter-revolutionary activities.

454
00:50:20,207 --> 00:50:26,510
You will begin by admitting that
you are a Christian!

455
00:50:26,613 --> 00:50:29,946
If it were true, what is the crime?

456
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:32,814
Our constitution guarantees
religious freedom

457
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,353
for all the people.

458
00:50:34,455 --> 00:50:35,820
You play games!

459
00:50:36,657 --> 00:50:37,817
[Chinese command]

460
00:50:51,905 --> 00:50:55,363
You accepted an honored teaching position

461
00:50:55,476 --> 00:50:57,774
wearing a mask of lies!

462
00:50:57,878 --> 00:51:01,746
Did you intend to infiltrate the minds
of our brave soldiers

463
00:51:01,849 --> 00:51:05,876
with your decadent beliefs?

464
00:51:05,986 --> 00:51:08,216
That is absurd.

465
00:51:08,989 --> 00:51:10,650
[Chinese command]

466
00:51:14,261 --> 00:51:17,059
Why did you marry a man
from Hong Kong

467
00:51:17,164 --> 00:51:21,066
who is not a member of the Party?

468
00:51:21,168 --> 00:51:25,502
I came to love him...

469
00:51:25,606 --> 00:51:30,942
Love is a bourgeois conceit!

470
00:51:31,044 --> 00:51:35,140
It has no place in this classless society.

471
00:51:35,249 --> 00:51:38,150
You speak of a classless society,

472
00:51:38,252 --> 00:51:41,244
yet you deliberately separate those
whose background

473
00:51:41,355 --> 00:51:43,823
was more privileged than your own.

474
00:51:43,924 --> 00:51:51,729
My background? Explain yourself! Whore!

475
00:51:51,832 --> 00:51:55,962
Your manner of speaking--

476
00:51:56,069 --> 00:51:58,560
the cutting way you express yourself--

477
00:51:58,672 --> 00:52:05,236
Maybe the custom in Northern China
but not here.

478
00:52:05,345 --> 00:52:09,076
You betray yourself!

479
00:52:09,183 --> 00:52:14,177
We must eat from the same rice bowl!

480
00:52:14,288 --> 00:52:18,918
You will answer "yes" or "no"
to my question.

481
00:52:19,026 --> 00:52:22,587
Are you a Christian?

482
00:52:28,902 --> 00:52:32,963
He may be distant from me,

483
00:52:33,073 --> 00:52:35,701
but I will not deny His presence.

484
00:52:35,809 --> 00:52:38,676
Yes or no?

485
00:52:41,915 --> 00:52:43,974
Yes...

486
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:56,061
Comrade, could I trouble you to call
and check and see

487
00:52:56,163 --> 00:52:57,858
if she is still working?

488
00:52:57,965 --> 00:52:59,762
She hasn't been home for three nights.

489
00:52:59,866 --> 00:53:03,165
You understand the problems men have.

490
00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:05,670
I need to see her.

491
00:53:05,772 --> 00:53:07,296
You are crazy and weak to let a women

492
00:53:07,407 --> 00:53:09,238
have that power over you.

493
00:53:09,343 --> 00:53:11,868
Put your mind and energies to your duties.

494
00:53:24,391 --> 00:53:26,825
You are allowed two minutes.

495
00:53:28,495 --> 00:53:31,487
God... I am unable to think.

496
00:53:38,672 --> 00:53:41,436
"Though I walk through the valley

497
00:53:41,541 --> 00:53:49,141
of the shadow of death
I shall fear no evil...

498
00:53:49,249 --> 00:53:51,945
for Thou are with me."

499
00:53:55,555 --> 00:53:58,820
Women, they're always a problem,
right?

500
00:54:00,961 --> 00:54:04,226
The hours are long till morning, huh?

501
00:54:04,331 --> 00:54:05,855
She has probably found a new friend

502
00:54:05,966 --> 00:54:10,232
and not bothered to tell you.

503
00:54:10,337 --> 00:54:14,569
Please forgive me for my years of silence.

504
00:54:14,675 --> 00:54:19,703
Help Cheng Shen... my parents...

505
00:54:28,355 --> 00:54:32,189
But my heart is with my child.

506
00:54:32,292 --> 00:54:35,819
Oh, God, is this a sin against my baby?

507
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:04,921
[gunshots] bang, bang, bang

508
00:55:29,116 --> 00:55:39,959
[remembering gun shots] bang, bang, bang

509
00:55:42,195 --> 00:55:43,287
It has been determined

510
00:55:43,397 --> 00:55:46,560
that it was some form of
electrical disturbance--

511
00:55:46,666 --> 00:55:49,658
A freak storm.

512
00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:56,175
Colonel, I respectfully request
the opportunity

513
00:55:56,276 --> 00:55:58,107
to speak to someone who was there...

514
00:55:58,211 --> 00:55:59,769
Perhaps one of the soldiers.

515
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:04,442
Why? To what purpose?

516
00:56:04,551 --> 00:56:09,352
I would like to ask--

517
00:56:09,456 --> 00:56:15,258
If they observed a lightening bolt
from heaven?

518
00:56:15,362 --> 00:56:24,134
To explain... words seem too small.

519
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:31,370
Why would the Christian God create
a miracle for you?

520
00:56:31,478 --> 00:56:34,379
Since you do not claim Him.

521
00:56:39,719 --> 00:56:50,061
Perhaps, He remembers more than
our minds can hold.

522
00:56:55,869 --> 00:56:59,361
You have been released from your
teaching position here.

523
00:56:59,473 --> 00:57:02,670
I am sorry for that.

524
00:57:02,776 --> 00:57:12,117
I regret my appearance.

525
00:57:12,219 --> 00:57:15,518
May I go home, Colonel?

526
00:57:15,622 --> 00:57:18,750
My time is near.

527
00:57:18,859 --> 00:57:21,487
Fifty six days maternity leave is granted

528
00:57:21,595 --> 00:57:24,462
to all the new mothers of China.

529
00:57:24,564 --> 00:57:27,465
But first you will give attention

530
00:57:27,567 --> 00:57:30,092
to another chapter in your autobiography.

531
00:57:30,203 --> 00:57:33,400
This time you will write about
your husband...

532
00:57:34,774 --> 00:57:40,644
[water bag breaks and water leaks out]

533
00:57:46,052 --> 00:57:49,544
Nurse, When can I see a doctor?

534
00:57:49,656 --> 00:57:53,524
You are number 27, The Doctor is seeing 14.

535
00:57:53,627 --> 00:57:56,528
Patience. First babies take their time.

536
00:58:02,903 --> 00:58:06,339
Remember when I was a little girl

537
00:58:06,439 --> 00:58:11,035
you told me I must be the first to walk
on the moon?

538
00:58:11,144 --> 00:58:17,447
Because no one ever remembers the second.

539
00:58:17,551 --> 00:58:20,281
Where is Cheng Shen?

540
00:58:20,387 --> 00:58:22,480
Why isn't he with me?

541
00:58:22,589 --> 00:58:23,954
I have told you.

542
00:58:24,057 --> 00:58:26,389
They keep him at the Courts at night.

543
00:58:26,493 --> 00:58:32,898
Sometimes until after 1 1:00.

544
00:58:32,999 --> 00:58:36,992
Mama, listen to me!

545
00:58:37,103 --> 00:58:40,504
Of all the stories I have told you,

546
00:58:40,607 --> 00:58:44,304
this one is the most true.

547
00:58:44,411 --> 00:58:46,504
I have a promise from God

548
00:58:46,613 --> 00:58:49,207
that we will all escape from China.

549
00:58:49,316 --> 00:58:52,911
I don't know how, but I have His promise.

550
00:58:53,019 --> 00:58:55,544
We will be free!

551
00:58:55,655 --> 00:58:57,350
Of course, darling.

552
00:58:57,457 --> 00:59:01,359
He spoke very clearly. It wasn't a dream!

553
00:59:16,242 --> 00:59:18,676
Oh, mama... mama...mama!

554
00:59:18,778 --> 00:59:22,339
It's all right... it's going to be all right, darling.

555
00:59:25,619 --> 00:59:33,151
[groaning and pushing sounds]

556
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:52,842
I want Chain Man to see flowers and green grass.

557
00:59:52,946 --> 00:59:55,574
You think he'll remember?

558
00:59:55,682 --> 00:59:58,344
Here.

559
01:00:06,259 --> 01:00:09,057
He smiled.

560
01:00:13,566 --> 01:00:16,797
May I ask you a private question?

561
01:00:16,903 --> 01:00:20,566
This is about as private as Shanghai gets.

562
01:00:20,674 --> 01:00:24,940
Today, the mother of my son can
ask me anything!

563
01:00:30,884 --> 01:00:34,081
Do you still believe in God?

564
01:00:34,187 --> 01:00:38,123
It's amazing how your mind works... God?

565
01:00:38,224 --> 01:00:42,251
You mean in the Christian sense?

566
01:00:42,362 --> 01:00:48,267
Mao cut out his tongue years ago.

567
01:00:48,368 --> 01:00:51,565
I still hear His voice.

568
01:00:51,671 --> 01:00:53,536
In the wind, no doubt.

569
01:01:04,217 --> 01:01:06,208
You are so handsome.

570
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:09,447
Absolutely perfect ears,

571
01:01:09,556 --> 01:01:13,048
and a wonderful, distinctive nose...

572
01:01:16,796 --> 01:01:19,629
Lam Sung Neng Yee?

573
01:01:25,138 --> 01:01:28,198
What is it?

574
01:01:28,308 --> 01:01:35,043
Only six more days. They want me back.

575
01:01:35,148 --> 01:01:37,673
Mama, I have to find milk!

576
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:52,055
...bus 42.

577
01:01:55,969 --> 01:01:57,596
Central line, please.

578
01:01:57,704 --> 01:02:02,073
Ah, the baby-- a boy or girl?

579
01:02:02,175 --> 01:02:04,973
I bet your first. How old?

580
01:02:05,078 --> 01:02:10,209
A boy and yes, my first. Seven weeks.

581
01:02:10,316 --> 01:02:13,080
You worry about leaving him so soon.

582
01:02:13,186 --> 01:02:14,175
He needs milk.

583
01:02:14,287 --> 01:02:16,414
I don't know when I can be with him.

584
01:02:16,523 --> 01:02:19,321
The stores in our district have been
out for weeks...

585
01:02:19,425 --> 01:02:21,120
My shift ends in twenty minutes.

586
01:02:21,227 --> 01:02:23,218
You wait!

587
01:02:23,329 --> 01:02:25,456
We'll talk about the milk.

588
01:02:41,848 --> 01:02:43,213
We meet on market days.

589
01:02:43,316 --> 01:02:45,409
No one pays attention.

590
01:02:50,957 --> 01:02:53,118
(Pastor) "The Lord is my light
and my salvation:

591
01:02:53,226 --> 01:02:57,890
whom shall I fear?

592
01:02:57,997 --> 01:03:00,989
The Lord is the strength of my life:

593
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:03,694
of whom shall I be afraid?"

594
01:03:03,803 --> 01:03:06,237
The Scriptures tell us that we are

595
01:03:06,339 --> 01:03:08,273
"children of the light."

596
01:03:08,374 --> 01:03:14,404
We see and hear what our tongues
can not always speak.

597
01:03:14,514 --> 01:03:17,881
Let us offer a silent praise.

598
01:03:17,984 --> 01:03:20,817
What shall we sing?

599
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:25,050
"Take My Life And Let It Be."

600
01:03:30,230 --> 01:03:45,772
[singing in silence as not to be heard]

601
01:03:45,879 --> 01:03:59,282
[music]

602
01:04:02,595 --> 01:04:07,157
This sister is being criticized by
the authorities.

603
01:04:07,267 --> 01:04:10,862
She has an urgent need for milk
for her son.

604
01:04:10,970 --> 01:04:15,839
I can bring fresh milk from the country
every Wednesday.

605
01:04:15,942 --> 01:04:19,400
(Woman) She must have some
powdered milk too.

606
01:04:19,512 --> 01:04:24,381
Carrying it so far-- The milk can sour.

607
01:04:24,484 --> 01:04:27,282
(Another woman) All powdered milk
is exported.

608
01:04:27,353 --> 01:04:31,050
But I have a friend who works in
the government store.

609
01:04:31,157 --> 01:04:33,785
I will speak to her.

610
01:05:51,971 --> 01:05:54,565
Today, you will write the history
of your husband.

611
01:05:54,674 --> 01:05:55,902
With respect, Colonel,

612
01:05:56,009 --> 01:05:58,307
I'm not that acquainted with
his personal history.

613
01:05:58,411 --> 01:06:03,348
Recall for us every conversation from
your first meeting.

614
01:06:03,449 --> 01:06:06,145
There is particular interest in
the money deposited

615
01:06:06,252 --> 01:06:09,653
each month in your account
from Hong Kong.

616
01:06:09,756 --> 01:06:11,383
A small amount.

617
01:06:11,491 --> 01:06:13,686
It comes from his family.

618
01:06:13,793 --> 01:06:16,284
How else would we survive?

619
01:06:18,664 --> 01:06:25,035
You! You come up! Come! You come up.

620
01:06:25,138 --> 01:06:29,040
You! You, back there!

621
01:06:29,142 --> 01:06:31,337
You forgot this last night.

622
01:06:31,444 --> 01:06:33,810
Don't be so careless next time.

623
01:06:33,913 --> 01:06:36,473
Thank you.

624
01:06:38,551 --> 01:06:42,544
Mama! I have milk. Powdered milk!

625
01:06:42,655 --> 01:06:48,457
Oh, you found it.

626
01:06:48,561 --> 01:06:51,553
He just went to sleep.

627
01:07:00,807 --> 01:07:04,766
I miss touching you.

628
01:07:04,877 --> 01:07:07,675
I measure each second that
we are alone

629
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:11,841
like chapters in a book.

630
01:07:11,951 --> 01:07:15,580
He will have no childhood.

631
01:07:15,688 --> 01:07:19,454
Cheng Shen, I have a plan!

632
01:07:19,559 --> 01:07:22,926
Don't you tell me anything!

633
01:07:23,029 --> 01:07:25,088
They compare our stories.

634
01:07:25,198 --> 01:07:27,632
We must keep a low profile--
live longer!

635
01:07:39,679 --> 01:07:40,839
What else did you bring back

636
01:07:40,947 --> 01:07:44,110
from Hong Kong besides stockings?

637
01:07:44,217 --> 01:07:46,879
I told you.

638
01:07:46,986 --> 01:07:51,719
I bought possibly two shirts-- pajamas.

639
01:07:51,824 --> 01:07:55,157
Why did you choose that
particular restaurant

640
01:07:55,261 --> 01:07:57,593
before the concert?

641
01:07:57,697 --> 01:08:02,725
I checked the menu. The prices
seemed fair.

642
01:08:02,835 --> 01:08:06,362
Where did you buy so many
phonograph records

643
01:08:06,472 --> 01:08:08,906
you keep in your apartment?

644
01:08:09,008 --> 01:08:12,603
I was a collection from over the years.

645
01:08:12,712 --> 01:08:16,079
What was the exact amount of the bill
for your dinner?

646
01:08:16,182 --> 01:08:20,084
I don't remember. How can it matter?

647
01:08:20,186 --> 01:08:22,313
Why did your father have
so many concubines?

648
01:08:22,421 --> 01:08:26,380
Do all rich men have such
an appetite for sex?

649
01:08:26,492 --> 01:08:28,357
Is your mother without passion?

650
01:08:28,461 --> 01:08:30,395
Be silent!

651
01:08:52,952 --> 01:08:55,216
Cheng Shen!

652
01:09:01,194 --> 01:09:03,355
I am ready to lie,

653
01:09:03,462 --> 01:09:06,920
but I don't know what to lie about.

654
01:09:07,033 --> 01:09:09,695
What have they done to you?

655
01:09:39,332 --> 01:09:42,495
I wanted to see if it would still fit.

656
01:09:42,602 --> 01:09:44,866
I can hear you playing the piano.

657
01:09:44,971 --> 01:09:46,871
Two keys are stuck. It is driving you crazy!

658
01:09:46,973 --> 01:09:49,840
Stop it! Stop it!

659
01:09:57,950 --> 01:10:01,044
How did we ever find each other?

660
01:10:01,153 --> 01:10:06,682
I knew you were mine the first time
I saw you.

661
01:10:06,792 --> 01:10:10,888
You play "what if" because "what is"

662
01:10:10,997 --> 01:10:14,091
is to impossible to confront.

663
01:10:27,747 --> 01:10:33,913
Today the temptation came
to give them what they want

664
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:41,017
and let them win...so that I can lose.

665
01:10:41,127 --> 01:10:44,153
It would all be over.

666
01:10:54,106 --> 01:10:56,006
Don't look at me!

667
01:10:59,512 --> 01:11:02,777
[NENG YEE Thinking] They bend us like
saplings in the wind.

668
01:11:02,882 --> 01:11:07,581
Our separations are more eloquent
than our meetings...

669
01:11:07,687 --> 01:11:14,490
I wonder, will we ever again dare
to be graceful together?

670
01:11:24,603 --> 01:11:29,302
I know you value a trusting heart.

671
01:11:29,408 --> 01:11:33,276
But Cheng Shen is drowning in
some private despair.

672
01:11:39,118 --> 01:11:43,885
Please forgive this little push...
if it is wrong.

673
01:11:57,069 --> 01:11:58,263
Wednesday's the market day.

674
01:11:58,371 --> 01:11:59,565
I always try to go.

675
01:11:59,672 --> 01:12:02,072
The vegetables come straight
from the fields.

676
01:12:02,174 --> 01:12:03,766
Do you shop there?

677
01:12:03,876 --> 01:12:07,744
I don't know that I'll be free Wednesday.

678
01:12:07,847 --> 01:12:11,476
Would you mail this for me?

679
01:12:11,584 --> 01:12:14,781
To Hong Kong.

680
01:12:14,887 --> 01:12:17,185
Ticket!

681
01:12:28,634 --> 01:12:32,161
When did you last see your father?

682
01:12:32,271 --> 01:12:35,570
My father?

683
01:12:35,674 --> 01:12:39,872
He has been detained at the clinic.

684
01:12:39,979 --> 01:12:44,973
Several months... I'm not sure as to
the exact date.

685
01:12:47,353 --> 01:12:50,789
Dr. Sung recently contacted the flu.

686
01:12:50,890 --> 01:12:54,519
He has been removed to the hospital
for observation.

687
01:12:54,627 --> 01:12:56,618
Perhaps you should visit him.

688
01:12:56,729 --> 01:12:59,926
Colonel, I respectfully seek
your permission.

689
01:13:10,176 --> 01:13:15,637
Papa...

690
01:13:15,748 --> 01:13:19,275
so, they're treating you like a big shot.

691
01:13:19,385 --> 01:13:24,880
Private room for a flu patient.

692
01:13:24,990 --> 01:13:27,788
Your Mother?

693
01:13:27,893 --> 01:13:29,884
She's worrying about you.

694
01:13:29,995 --> 01:13:31,963
Never letting Chuin Man out of her sight.

695
01:13:32,064 --> 01:13:35,431
You know Mama.

696
01:13:35,534 --> 01:13:41,302
Promise, Neng Yee, promise you will
take care of her!

697
01:13:41,407 --> 01:13:43,705
Maybe they'll let you come home at last.

698
01:13:43,809 --> 01:13:47,404
It's only the flu, Papa.

699
01:13:47,513 --> 01:13:52,177
You have always been blessed with
strong dreams.

700
01:13:52,284 --> 01:13:55,742
As much a son as daughter to me.

701
01:13:55,855 --> 01:14:00,758
Papa...

702
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:04,626
They're experimenting with a new drug.

703
01:14:04,730 --> 01:14:08,666
It causes extensive bleeding.

704
01:14:18,611 --> 01:14:23,275
Nurse! Nurse! We need help!

705
01:14:37,630 --> 01:14:46,800
[NENG YEE speaking] Our daughter, Chuin Way,
was one month old when Papa left us.

706
01:14:54,446 --> 01:15:02,182
The crime was murder without
proof of intent.

707
01:15:02,288 --> 01:15:05,724
We have to take what happens.

708
01:15:05,824 --> 01:15:08,793
Swallow the bitterness.

709
01:15:33,152 --> 01:15:37,816
Oh, God, I confess to you

710
01:15:37,923 --> 01:15:41,188
that my faith is small.

711
01:15:56,108 --> 01:16:00,044
Not all of us will escape the fire unscathed.

712
01:16:00,145 --> 01:16:02,705
Some will stumble so that we will be

713
01:16:02,815 --> 01:16:09,311
refined and purified for His purpose.

714
01:16:09,421 --> 01:16:17,851
When you plant melon seeds,
you harvest melons.

715
01:16:17,963 --> 01:16:23,230
When you plant bean seeds,
you get beans.

716
01:16:23,335 --> 01:16:30,537
When you plant seeds of faith,
you find God!

717
01:16:39,952 --> 01:16:43,888
I want to thank you for helping
my babies.

718
01:16:43,989 --> 01:16:48,824
and for helping me.

719
01:16:48,927 --> 01:16:53,364
This is our sister of the Firing Squad.

720
01:16:53,465 --> 01:16:56,593
China has seen many things

721
01:16:56,702 --> 01:17:02,436
that some of us would call "miracles"
since the Revolution.

722
01:17:02,541 --> 01:17:06,671
He has given me a message for our sister.

723
01:17:06,779 --> 01:17:13,048
Our Lord has asked you to trust Him for
one day at a time.

724
01:17:13,152 --> 01:17:15,848
The days will become weeks,

725
01:17:15,954 --> 01:17:22,257
and weeks into months and months
will fall into years.

726
01:17:22,361 --> 01:17:24,124
one day at a time.

727
01:17:26,832 --> 01:17:30,734
[screaming and shouting]

728
01:17:32,237 --> 01:17:35,035
Do not resist. Do not resist.

729
01:17:39,111 --> 01:17:43,844
[screaming and shouting]

730
01:18:01,066 --> 01:18:03,626
Word has just reached me
that your husband

731
01:18:03,736 --> 01:18:08,833
has made a full confession
to our charges of espionage.

732
01:18:08,941 --> 01:18:11,307
A spy!

733
01:18:11,410 --> 01:18:15,676
Guilty of conspiring with
foreign governments.

734
01:18:51,617 --> 01:18:53,608
They told me that you made
a full confession

735
01:18:53,719 --> 01:18:56,187
that I was a spy...

736
01:18:56,288 --> 01:18:57,277
Lies...

737
01:18:57,389 --> 01:18:58,321
that I betray my country...

738
01:18:58,423 --> 01:18:59,913
Lies... Lies...

739
01:19:00,025 --> 01:19:02,619
They said that you were very convincing.

740
01:19:02,728 --> 01:19:05,128
Lies!

741
01:19:07,399 --> 01:19:09,424
It's okay... it's okay.

742
01:19:32,124 --> 01:19:34,922
It's impossible. Not now.

743
01:19:35,027 --> 01:19:36,688
Reality, Mama.

744
01:19:36,795 --> 01:19:40,356
Reality is always possible.

745
01:19:40,465 --> 01:19:42,228
I'll go to Shek Tong Ting.

746
01:19:42,334 --> 01:19:46,532
I'll buy the strongest potion of ginseng

747
01:19:46,638 --> 01:19:48,265
and you must go to the Bath House

748
01:19:48,373 --> 01:19:50,273
and sit in a tub of scalding water.

749
01:19:50,375 --> 01:19:52,935
It's past the time for potions, Mama.

750
01:19:53,045 --> 01:19:55,775
It's already the second month!

751
01:19:59,685 --> 01:20:02,449
Oh, you had a letter from Hong Kong
this morning.

752
01:20:02,554 --> 01:20:03,816
Where is it?

753
01:20:03,922 --> 01:20:05,082
There.

754
01:20:05,190 --> 01:20:07,351
Why didn't you tell me?

755
01:20:07,459 --> 01:20:10,326
Because you make my heart stop!

756
01:20:15,167 --> 01:20:16,930
His father is dying, Colonel.

757
01:20:17,035 --> 01:20:20,471
He asks to see his son for the last time!

758
01:20:20,572 --> 01:20:22,267
My mother-in-law has enclosed
a certificate

759
01:20:22,374 --> 01:20:25,605
signed by the Doctor.

760
01:20:25,711 --> 01:20:28,703
I respectfully request a 30 day exit permit
for my husband

761
01:20:28,814 --> 01:20:32,580
to visit his father at this time of sadness.

762
01:20:40,893 --> 01:20:45,523
What assurance can you offer that
he will return in 30 days?

763
01:20:45,631 --> 01:20:48,759
I will be your assurance.

764
01:20:48,867 --> 01:20:52,860
His parents have never seen their grandchildren.

765
01:20:52,971 --> 01:20:54,495
I humbly request that his daughter

766
01:20:54,606 --> 01:20:56,631
be allowed to accompany him.

767
01:20:56,742 --> 01:20:58,972
Your husband has been assigned to a camp

768
01:20:59,077 --> 01:21:02,342
where he will experience labor reform.

769
01:21:02,447 --> 01:21:06,178
All educated people should learn how
to work with their backs.

770
01:21:06,285 --> 01:21:08,981
Could that order not be postponed
for 30 days. Colonel?

771
01:21:09,087 --> 01:21:12,284
How do you know he won't abandon you?

772
01:21:12,391 --> 01:21:15,417
I have his son.

773
01:21:15,527 --> 01:21:21,261
Family ties remain important even in
the new China.

774
01:21:21,366 --> 01:21:25,735
And I am two months pregnant.

775
01:21:25,837 --> 01:21:29,102
Having children is proof that we are alive--

776
01:21:29,207 --> 01:21:32,074
that we have worth!

777
01:21:41,119 --> 01:21:43,849
Don't be a dreamer.

778
01:21:43,956 --> 01:21:46,891
They will never let you go.

779
01:21:50,362 --> 01:21:52,125
I will come back.

780
01:21:52,230 --> 01:21:55,722
No! You must not even consider it.

781
01:22:10,615 --> 01:22:15,075
I may not see you again while I am still
in my twenties.

782
01:22:15,187 --> 01:22:20,716
Perhaps even my thirties.

783
01:22:20,826 --> 01:22:25,889
Please wait for me!

784
01:22:25,998 --> 01:22:28,091
If I am in my forties,

785
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:32,534
Mama always said a touch of gray
was becoming.

786
01:22:32,637 --> 01:22:35,868
I hope you'll agree.

787
01:22:46,985 --> 01:22:50,113
I have instructions for Chuin Way.

788
01:24:04,429 --> 01:24:07,762
A safe journey for your husband
and daughter.

789
01:24:07,866 --> 01:24:09,857
The penalty for escaping to Hong Kong

790
01:24:09,968 --> 01:24:13,927
is a minimum of ten years in prison.

791
01:24:19,144 --> 01:24:22,739
I am not escaping, Colonel.

792
01:24:22,848 --> 01:24:24,713
It has been decided that you will serve

793
01:24:24,816 --> 01:24:29,617
you husband's term as forced labor
until he returns.

794
01:24:49,808 --> 01:24:51,901
I hear you were once a teacher.

795
01:24:52,010 --> 01:24:56,470
Chemistry was my subject--1 7 years!

796
01:24:56,581 --> 01:24:58,981
We don't talk here.

797
01:24:59,084 --> 01:25:03,646
But I miss intelligent conversation.

798
01:25:03,755 --> 01:25:06,781
They work us like animals,

799
01:25:06,892 --> 01:25:10,794
but what is in our minds will not go away.

800
01:25:16,635 --> 01:25:20,594
Don't help me. Stay back!

801
01:25:59,744 --> 01:26:03,145
I am here to apply for an exit permit.

802
01:26:03,248 --> 01:26:05,273
I intend to visit relatives in Hong Kong

803
01:26:05,383 --> 01:26:09,285
during my 56 day maternity leave.

804
01:26:09,387 --> 01:26:11,651
You should have applied months ago.

805
01:26:11,756 --> 01:26:14,554
Your baby will be sitting up
before the applications

806
01:26:14,659 --> 01:26:18,527
are stamped by all the official agencies.

807
01:26:21,366 --> 01:26:27,202
But will I be permitted to fill out
the "appropriate forms?"

808
01:26:27,305 --> 01:26:34,040
The forms are easy. The procedure
is difficult.

809
01:27:19,724 --> 01:27:23,182
Any news for Lam Neng Yee?
My exit permit?

810
01:27:23,295 --> 01:27:25,456
Oh, yes. I have news for you.

811
01:27:25,563 --> 01:27:29,055
Go to the bathhouse. You smell
like a beggar!

812
01:27:30,435 --> 01:27:33,029
I will return in two days!

813
01:27:33,138 --> 01:27:35,538
I told you, you're dreaming.

814
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:38,632
Two days!

815
01:27:45,884 --> 01:27:47,181
Lam Neng Yee?

816
01:27:47,285 --> 01:27:50,516
Report to the medical section.

817
01:27:54,993 --> 01:27:58,827
I haven't felt the baby move
for two days now.

818
01:27:58,930 --> 01:28:01,922
The heartbeat is strong.

819
01:28:02,033 --> 01:28:04,558
There is evidence of a kidney infection.

820
01:28:04,669 --> 01:28:07,365
That is why you are retaining fluids.

821
01:28:07,472 --> 01:28:12,432
The nurse will give you some
vitamin C tablets.

822
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:18,380
Could you have miscalculated the time?

823
01:28:18,483 --> 01:28:23,420
Your ninth month?

824
01:28:23,521 --> 01:28:25,819
Yes.

825
01:29:04,863 --> 01:29:08,492
The baby will not be born in China!

826
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:12,502
Then where?

827
01:29:12,604 --> 01:29:15,698
I forgot to ask.

828
01:29:15,807 --> 01:29:20,267
Somewhere free...

829
01:29:20,378 --> 01:29:26,339
I don't understand why God should speak
to you directly.

830
01:29:26,451 --> 01:29:30,251
Because nobody else could deliver
the message!

831
01:29:33,792 --> 01:29:36,090
I read a book once about Christian saints

832
01:29:36,194 --> 01:29:39,163
in the Middle Ages.

833
01:29:39,264 --> 01:29:42,995
They spoke like you.

834
01:29:43,101 --> 01:29:47,333
I have His promise, Mama!

835
01:29:47,439 --> 01:29:50,340
Has He promised to keep you alive
in that hell hole?

836
01:30:04,789 --> 01:30:07,622
(Guard 1) The old cow is slowing down.

837
01:30:07,725 --> 01:30:11,923
(Guard 2) That baby's going to get
dumped with the rocks.

838
01:30:27,946 --> 01:30:30,414
How can you find the strength?

839
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:03,513
"You tell the world the Communist Party

840
01:31:03,615 --> 01:31:05,480
has brought freedom to China.

841
01:31:05,583 --> 01:31:08,609
I want to go to Hong Kong to see
my father-in-law who is dying.

842
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:11,348
You will not let me go!

843
01:31:11,456 --> 01:31:14,016
I am using my 56 days maternity leave
to go

844
01:31:14,125 --> 01:31:17,322
so it will not interfere with
my labor training job.

845
01:31:17,428 --> 01:31:22,525
You have no reason not to grant me
an exit visa.

846
01:31:22,634 --> 01:31:24,499
Please check with other departments

847
01:31:24,602 --> 01:31:29,562
to see what they are doing
about my application."

848
01:31:29,674 --> 01:31:32,541
It is over 21 words, you lose the rate.

849
01:31:32,644 --> 01:31:35,943
Very expensive for you.

850
01:31:36,047 --> 01:31:39,278
Every word is important.

851
01:31:39,384 --> 01:31:42,649
I will pay!

852
01:31:42,754 --> 01:31:46,986
Where do you want this to go?

853
01:31:47,091 --> 01:31:49,651
To our great Chairman Mao Tse Tung.

854
01:31:49,761 --> 01:31:52,229
To Zhou Enlai, Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs

855
01:31:52,330 --> 01:31:54,321
and the Central Police in Beijing.

856
01:31:54,432 --> 01:31:57,367
I don't have a name.

857
01:31:57,468 --> 01:32:05,933
You want to send 3 telegrams to Beijing
each 91 words?

858
01:32:06,044 --> 01:32:11,880
I have cash. Let me check your count.

859
01:32:14,986 --> 01:32:19,616
You again! Don't ask! Just Go!

860
01:32:19,724 --> 01:32:23,285
Why is it nobody in Shanghai has
any answers.

861
01:32:23,394 --> 01:32:25,919
I have to go to the top of the ladder.

862
01:32:26,030 --> 01:32:28,260
You can go where you want to go

863
01:32:28,366 --> 01:32:30,596
just as long as it's away from here!

864
01:32:34,806 --> 01:32:36,637
Top of the ladder!

865
01:32:39,377 --> 01:32:45,680
You! The fat one! Out! Go back!

866
01:32:45,783 --> 01:32:49,685
Go Back!

867
01:33:14,579 --> 01:33:17,047
It's bad enough that you use
that old gimmick

868
01:33:17,148 --> 01:33:20,049
of your maternity leave.

869
01:33:20,151 --> 01:33:24,144
In 56 days you could go
around the world.

870
01:33:24,255 --> 01:33:26,746
Then I would be back in Shanghai,
Captain.

871
01:33:26,858 --> 01:33:31,591
Cunning like a beggar too, huh?

872
01:33:31,696 --> 01:33:36,759
Beijing has called us twice about
your application.

873
01:33:36,868 --> 01:33:40,099
This office has been unduly criticized.

874
01:33:40,204 --> 01:33:43,799
You have caused us to lose face!

875
01:33:48,513 --> 01:33:52,643
Sign! Report to this address.

876
01:34:10,902 --> 01:34:14,269
I was about to have tea.

877
01:34:14,372 --> 01:34:20,038
Please, sit. Come.

878
01:34:45,837 --> 01:34:51,434
I assumed your children would grow up
under the Red flag.

879
01:34:51,542 --> 01:34:57,503
You have had capitalistic ideas
from birth --

880
01:34:57,615 --> 01:35:02,279
but your children...

881
01:35:02,386 --> 01:35:07,722
Perhaps it was a personal goal.

882
01:35:07,825 --> 01:35:11,317
You've served your husband well.

883
01:35:11,429 --> 01:35:13,761
I would be pleased for the opportunity

884
01:35:13,865 --> 01:35:18,165
to express that personally.

885
01:35:18,269 --> 01:35:24,367
That may be possible, Colonel.

886
01:35:24,475 --> 01:35:26,602
One day...

887
01:35:32,416 --> 01:35:36,477
A higher authority has granted
your exit permit.

888
01:35:36,587 --> 01:35:44,050
It is known, of course, that you will
not return to China.

889
01:35:44,162 --> 01:35:53,628
Only God knows... China is my home.

890
01:35:53,738 --> 01:35:56,605
Please take your God with you.

891
01:35:56,707 --> 01:36:00,905
Tell Him it is His last chance to escape.

892
01:36:01,012 --> 01:36:07,349
Within a decade He'll be locked away
in a museum.

893
01:36:07,451 --> 01:36:14,289
To do that, Colonel, you would have to
imprison the wind!

894
01:36:27,338 --> 01:36:29,636
Safe journey.

895
01:36:53,497 --> 01:36:59,663
(NENG YEE'S VOICE) You will come, Mama.
I have His promise!

896
01:36:59,770 --> 01:37:04,332
Let me go now. Please.

897
01:37:04,442 --> 01:37:07,741
A way will open for you...

898
01:38:27,925 --> 01:38:30,860
Oh! Chuin Man!

899
01:39:08,265 --> 01:39:17,401
Chuin Man! Look!

900
01:39:24,515 --> 01:39:27,075
I'm going out there.

901
01:39:42,867 --> 01:39:45,631
Neng Yee!

902
01:40:08,459 --> 01:40:14,398
You made it in your 20's after all.

903
01:40:14,498 --> 01:40:18,901
Look at us.

904
01:40:19,003 --> 01:40:21,665
I am so ashamed.

905
01:40:48,265 --> 01:40:52,497
I missed your presence.

906
01:40:52,603 --> 01:40:57,302
When our son is born,

907
01:40:57,408 --> 01:41:02,903
I promise to be young again.

908
01:41:03,013 --> 01:41:05,538
You won, Neng Yee.

909
01:41:05,649 --> 01:41:08,379
You won for all of us.
