1
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,379
Well done, Bo Tat.

2
00:01:14,463 --> 00:01:16,924
Linh, time to go home.

3
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:15,528
SIX YEARS LATER

4
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:55,237
Get up. Doyle and I am your
give me a ride. We go.

5
00:03:15,383 --> 00:03:18,970
Captain Doyle, we can
not directly to the LZ.

6
00:03:19,096 --> 00:03:23,725
Beaucoup North Vietnamese.
We take the scenic route.

7
00:04:42,267 --> 00:04:43,894
Two hours.

8
00:04:49,191 --> 00:04:53,863
Charlie 's got a gun.
He's always there.

9
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:57,158
He gets not even ...

10
00:04:57,617 --> 00:05:00,745
Go ahead, Charlie, come on.

11
00:05:12,341 --> 00:05:14,760
Do you have another one?

12
00:05:26,564 --> 00:05:29,025
Thanks for the ride.

13
00:05:38,077 --> 00:05:43,165
Poor rat? Not good, makes
people sick. Better to eat snake.

14
00:05:51,966 --> 00:05:55,971
No, thank you.
- You're Captain Doyle.

15
00:05:56,346 --> 00:05:58,473
I am Jhon.

16
00:05:59,725 --> 00:06:02,352
Where is Captain Cahill?

17
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:07,817
He's upstairs. But you first
rest. We eat and then we go.

18
00:06:07,983 --> 00:06:10,653
I'm waiting for you upstairs.

19
00:06:27,504 --> 00:06:30,883
Try it with 25 kilos luggage.

20
00:06:57,578 --> 00:07:01,874
Not your fault.
Not accustomed to thin air.

21
00:07:05,044 --> 00:07:07,714
Do you know Captain Sam?

22
00:07:08,506 --> 00:07:10,967
Hearsay.

23
00:07:11,134 --> 00:07:16,389
In my house everybody knows' m
He is a legend. Where is he?

24
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:41,499
Cahill.
- Sam is there.

25
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:44,169
What cabin?
- There is Sam.

26
00:07:51,552 --> 00:07:55,139
Captain Samuel Cahill? SOG / AT 39?

27
00:07:58,601 --> 00:08:00,228
Stop.

28
00:08:09,237 --> 00:08:11,740
This is Captain Doyle.

29
00:08:11,907 --> 00:08:16,245
He is my replacement.

30
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,460
You're the guest of honor.

31
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:27,256
Thanks for the reception.

32
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:32,303
We have been waiting for you.
Did you have trouble with that hill?

33
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:40,604
They show a wine ceremony
for important visit.

34
00:08:40,813 --> 00:08:45,025
And a wine ceremony
on Tuesday to celebrate.

35
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:52,575
That is numpai, rice wine. 'T Tastes
like sugar water, mixed with vomit.

36
00:08:52,742 --> 00:08:58,957
A bit early to be drunk.
- You should drink it. Totally.

37
00:08:59,165 --> 00:09:04,713
And you can not spit.
This insult you talking chief.

38
00:09:42,211 --> 00:09:47,050
Is that all? Come on.
- No, you know Po.

39
00:09:50,386 --> 00:09:56,560
Po? Sometimes he is the village elder or something?
- Something like that. He comes on.

40
00:09:56,727 --> 00:10:01,356
Close your eyes.
Po wants to touch your face.

41
00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:06,362
Po is not offensive. That's worse
then spit out the wine.

42
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,991
Eyes closed.
- My eyes shut.

43
00:10:28,677 --> 00:10:31,806
The chokes are the NVA.

44
00:10:31,972 --> 00:10:36,978
They know that the tribe help us.
For it they fall to lowest.

45
00:10:37,145 --> 00:10:40,189
Rule 1: Do not give any reason.

46
00:10:40,356 --> 00:10:44,319
Therefore, you could not directly
come here.

47
00:10:44,486 --> 00:10:48,281
And rule two?
- Never forget rule 1.

48
00:10:49,241 --> 00:10:52,244
I can remember.

49
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:58,542
I'm going Saturday, but we have 'a week.
- I can handle it, Captain.

50
00:10:58,876 --> 00:11:03,756
How are you doing? Under the rules?
- Is there a better way?

51
00:11:09,012 --> 00:11:14,768
I got some control. Jhon leads
around you and can give information.

52
00:11:14,976 --> 00:11:19,773
I do not for a tour.
I have to go to the Path.

53
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,193
The big stuff coming tonight.

54
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,531
Until then you can 't teach village
know, Captain Doyle.

55
00:11:27,657 --> 00:11:32,036
These people are the difference
between life and death for me.

56
00:11:43,674 --> 00:11:47,177
What is that?
- The forest gives us a lot.

57
00:11:47,386 --> 00:11:51,766
As we honor the good spirits
for their protection.

58
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,779
Is it not a pet?
- No, We use the elephants.

59
00:12:04,946 --> 00:12:10,285
My father, his father, always.
War elephant drives south.

60
00:12:10,452 --> 00:12:13,997
The Roof NHE are blessed
with n elephant.

61
00:12:14,164 --> 00:12:17,376
I am happy for you. Let ...

62
00:12:19,378 --> 00:12:23,382
We go to the Path.
- Sam said: Later on.

63
00:12:23,549 --> 00:12:27,637
Now you work for me. Forget Sam.
Where 's Path?

64
00:12:27,846 --> 00:12:29,848
Forgotten.

65
00:12:30,056 --> 00:12:32,392
Got candy?

66
00:12:32,601 --> 00:12:37,230
No candy. Go.
- Please, candy. I share.

67
00:12:44,488 --> 00:12:48,326
I have only one.
Do you understand? One.

68
00:12:59,838 --> 00:13:01,882
Very nice.

69
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:04,051
Is that all?

70
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:08,514
The Ho Chi Minh trail.
Disappointed? That was me too.

71
00:13:08,722 --> 00:13:13,644
I was expecting something fresh definition.
That's the beautiful.

72
00:13:13,853 --> 00:13:18,358
You let platbombarderen
and they move it.

73
00:13:18,566 --> 00:13:22,821
They use it for supplies.
It goes on.

74
00:13:24,114 --> 00:13:29,494
Check it out. Air target
rocket launcher on the shoulder.

75
00:13:31,038 --> 00:13:34,458
This is the second set this week.
- Really?

76
00:14:15,543 --> 00:14:22,801
America does not care gift.

77
00:14:22,926 --> 00:14:24,511
Remember that.

78
00:14:25,512 --> 00:14:30,100
No, no.
- Shut up.

79
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:35,231
Because you Americans help
we have to punish you.

80
00:14:42,072 --> 00:14:46,326
Colonel Nguyen, you will find this
really necessary?

81
00:14:47,285 --> 00:14:50,956
Do you think I do not
to do Quang?

82
00:14:51,165 --> 00:14:53,334
Do you do it then.

83
00:15:27,495 --> 00:15:31,791
You bring evil spirits.
- It's my fault.

84
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,882
That child had picked that candy.
He picked it and then ran away.

85
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:48,225
Well, it was my fault.
Sorry about that elephant.

86
00:15:48,434 --> 00:15:51,645
I 'd be alive
want to create.

87
00:15:51,854 --> 00:15:53,731
Just go away.

88
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:58,528
Best, I do not work with them.
- Maybe.

89
00:15:59,445 --> 00:16:04,659
The tradition is, on the last day
't New-Moon Festival ...

90
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:09,748
... , the Fire King on
to the elephant. That was Friday.

91
00:16:09,957 --> 00:16:12,376
Hurry.
- Why?

92
00:16:12,584 --> 00:16:19,008
Duan, I give you my word
Fire at the King 's festival ...

93
00:16:19,216 --> 00:16:24,973
... not need to own two feet
stand. He gets a new elephant.

94
00:16:28,143 --> 00:16:31,229
I'm not going to get them elephant.

95
00:16:39,822 --> 00:16:43,784
They helped us.
- Give them show a tractor.

96
00:16:43,993 --> 00:16:47,914
Give them nothing.
You sit too long in the jungle.

97
00:16:48,122 --> 00:16:50,750
Keep your mouth shut.

98
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:58,175
The village is important
for our operations.

99
00:16:58,383 --> 00:17:02,429
If we do not get elephant,
We are the village lost.

100
00:17:02,638 --> 00:17:05,974
We have the village
simply not necessary.

101
00:17:09,145 --> 00:17:15,818
Maybe we 't need
either. Let us be careful.

102
00:17:16,027 --> 00:17:21,241
You get an elephant for them.
- Five men manage it.

103
00:17:22,117 --> 00:17:27,414
You get two of the finest and
smartest that I can borrow.

104
00:17:29,374 --> 00:17:33,754
Vanishing. Whatever you do,
puts me mad.

105
00:17:33,963 --> 00:17:36,674
Do not worry.

106
00:17:37,508 --> 00:17:39,385
Moment.

107
00:17:39,594 --> 00:17:44,432
Not forgetting something?
Who runs this beautiful operation?

108
00:17:44,641 --> 00:17:46,059
I.

109
00:17:46,267 --> 00:17:51,106
You both want the lead.
I don 't out.

110
00:17:51,314 --> 00:17:54,151
Odd or even?
- Just.

111
00:18:03,828 --> 00:18:07,081
Corporal Ashford?
- He sits in the shed.

112
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:16,299
Ashford, come forth immediately.
- Sir, he is really stuck.

113
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:24,850
Why not?
- He still has seven days.

114
00:18:25,059 --> 00:18:30,898
He can go home, he takes no
risk. He's already two days.

115
00:18:39,491 --> 00:18:43,829
Grenade. Very nice, who is
klootz that funny ...

116
00:18:49,418 --> 00:18:51,462
Mistake.

117
00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:05,351
Packing. It departs at 1300 hours.
You have a new assignment.

118
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:09,981
Kidding, right?
- Yes.

119
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:15,612
It can not. About seven days
I fly back to freedom.

120
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,284
Only 168 hours.

121
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:26,123
It takes just a short time.
- For 1300 hours, Ashford.

122
00:19:49,565 --> 00:19:50,900
Damn.

123
00:19:54,153 --> 00:19:57,156
Corporal Farley.
- Yes, sir.

124
00:19:57,448 --> 00:20:01,536
What is the mission?
Can we know?

125
00:20:01,745 --> 00:20:04,623
We do, but not you.

126
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:10,170
Where are you from?
- Iowa, like Uncle Fergus says:

127
00:20:10,379 --> 00:20:15,676
Ai, oh, how I pay much interest.
He sat in the threshing machine.

128
00:20:15,885 --> 00:20:20,139
Ma says she 't see
but I believe so.

129
00:20:20,348 --> 00:20:24,853
Are you a farmer's son?
- My dad's got a dairy.

130
00:20:25,061 --> 00:20:28,231
Do you have experience with animals?

131
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:33,695
Not a good experience. They allowed me
not. That will remain so.

132
00:20:33,946 --> 00:20:36,782
It was not an easy youth.

133
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:41,662
I wanted to employ in order
that monster to get away.

134
00:20:48,378 --> 00:20:52,966
Gilman, I want to watch 25
300 for each.

135
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:00,515
I have friends without respect
a person's life.

136
00:21:00,724 --> 00:21:04,770
If I want, I have tomorrow
your head here in my pocket.

137
00:21:04,979 --> 00:21:08,607
General, for each other. 425 each.

138
00:21:09,483 --> 00:21:12,445
Nice to do business with you

139
00:21:12,653 --> 00:21:16,157
Do you dear wife and
daughter greetings.

140
00:21:16,366 --> 00:21:20,996
What I mean anything with it. I must
hang up the other line goes.

141
00:21:21,204 --> 00:21:27,544
Where were we? In your head
in a bag? 350? Agreed.

142
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:31,966
Send them to General
Richardson in Danang.

143
00:21:32,174 --> 00:21:36,804
Anyway, let someone do
but your food to taste.

144
00:21:45,063 --> 00:21:49,401
I thought you were dead.
- I was hoping you, you mean.

145
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:51,403
Say it.

146
00:21:51,611 --> 00:21:55,741
You're foerageur?
You need something foraging.

147
00:22:03,624 --> 00:22:06,794
Not fun.
- An elephant tomorrow.

148
00:22:07,003 --> 00:22:09,839
Or you do not succeed, do you think?

149
00:22:10,048 --> 00:22:16,304
Come on, you do not provoke me.
I can get everything. Everyone knows that.

150
00:22:16,513 --> 00:22:19,349
I go five days to leave.

151
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,854
Tomorrow at this time I'm
on the beach in Hawaii.

152
00:22:24,063 --> 00:22:27,733
You provide us the elephant.
- Or what?

153
00:22:27,942 --> 00:22:31,153
It started with
that one joke on?

154
00:22:31,362 --> 00:22:34,282
Well, that meat was not fresh.

155
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:37,702
The men were "a week
the latrine.

156
00:22:37,911 --> 00:22:44,042
Old news. I have too many powerful
friends to show a dew to get.

157
00:22:44,251 --> 00:22:48,964
I also know other things, Poole.
- Listen, Cahill ...

158
00:22:49,173 --> 00:22:53,886
... nothing keeps me from
go to Honolulu.

159
00:23:04,314 --> 00:23:10,195
280 km in the middle 's war.
- By 'n truck it takes three days.

160
00:23:10,404 --> 00:23:16,368
Then one day walk. We meet Friday.
- I was planning on going through the air.

161
00:23:16,577 --> 00:23:19,914
With n cargo plane
Ban from Thurs

162
00:23:20,122 --> 00:23:24,210
With the elephant to
an airstrip at Dak NHE.

163
00:23:24,418 --> 00:23:29,424
Your friends will have two hours
the elephant, I can go to Hawaii.

164
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:33,720
You had a week.
Well done, Poole.

165
00:23:33,929 --> 00:23:38,350
We arrive at Ban Don to.
We can not countries.

166
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:41,437
We land behind the village.

167
00:23:41,645 --> 00:23:44,440
There was Vietcong.
Not anymore, I guess.

168
00:23:44,648 --> 00:23:48,986
I think? Country we 're thinking?
- Go ahead.

169
00:24:10,843 --> 00:24:15,014
This is not so bad,
it's quite peaceful here.

170
00:24:15,306 --> 00:24:17,850
All right, guys.

171
00:24:25,984 --> 00:24:28,987
Cahill, you would like elephants ...

172
00:24:29,196 --> 00:24:33,909
... then you get elephants.
And beautiful, at no additional cost.

173
00:24:34,118 --> 00:24:39,331
As I know you are attaching
dolls with men in it.

174
00:24:56,266 --> 00:24:58,602
Y B'ham?

175
00:25:00,938 --> 00:25:05,401
I am negotiating. I 'm
spoken on the radio.

176
00:25:05,609 --> 00:25:09,947
He fancies himself a hard,
cracking but I got it.

177
00:25:12,992 --> 00:25:17,288
Hello, sir. We were
40,000 agreed.

178
00:25:17,497 --> 00:25:21,460
There are additional costs.
Tax, cleaning ...

179
00:25:21,668 --> 00:25:25,088
I understand that.
- 60,000 so.

180
00:25:25,297 --> 00:25:28,676
No. 45,000.
- 60,000.

181
00:25:30,636 --> 00:25:32,680
50,000.

182
00:25:36,851 --> 00:25:41,147
What? Are not you?
- I 'm not under pressure.

183
00:25:41,356 --> 00:25:44,609
He does the elephant
not to sell.

184
00:25:44,818 --> 00:25:48,196
How much does he want?
- 60,000 piastres.

185
00:25:48,405 --> 00:25:54,161
We can only go to 50,000.
- 10,000 piastres is only $ 150.

186
00:25:54,369 --> 00:25:59,208
That together we can muster.
- No. 50,000, otherwise not.

187
00:25:59,417 --> 00:26:04,046
No military purchases
own money. That's an order.

188
00:26:04,255 --> 00:26:07,050
Understood? Say it.

189
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:14,599
I see. So you get on it.
No sale, no more mission.

190
00:26:14,808 --> 00:26:17,352
You always wanted.

191
00:26:18,854 --> 00:26:23,692
We go back and recall
a helicopter. Forward.

192
00:26:24,235 --> 00:26:27,738
Poole, we are going.
- Okay, 50,000.

193
00:26:34,162 --> 00:26:37,666
What can you negotiate well.

194
00:26:39,417 --> 00:26:44,882
Gracious lord, can we
Our pick of the river elephant?

195
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:50,471
For 50,000 you get an elephant
from the river, but Bo Tat.

196
00:27:11,535 --> 00:27:17,374
Bo Tat is a she not a he.
The boy is Linh, he goes along.

197
00:27:17,583 --> 00:27:23,047
Boy does not count Bo Tat.
- Boy is so bad with Bo Tat.

198
00:27:23,256 --> 00:27:29,095
We are going away. His family ...
- His whole family was slain.

199
00:27:29,304 --> 00:27:33,642
In the war?
- Touched by a falling star.

200
00:27:34,935 --> 00:27:38,313
Yes, in the war.
- Which side?

201
00:27:38,522 --> 00:27:42,484
Does it matter?
- It is better to stay here.

202
00:27:42,735 --> 00:27:46,572
He does not belong here.
He comes from it north.

203
00:27:46,781 --> 00:27:49,242
Let him go.

204
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:54,330
He does not count.
- Under my responsibility.

205
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:59,127
Who can show to elephant?

206
00:27:59,336 --> 00:28:03,966
I had 's a fat friend,
but they did not listen.

207
00:28:04,174 --> 00:28:07,803
Mr. Y B'ham, you know
determine how.

208
00:28:08,012 --> 00:28:11,849
I'm living my life
with them and I learn anything?

209
00:28:12,058 --> 00:28:15,061
Well does he sarcastic?

210
00:28:24,863 --> 00:28:29,034
Would you join us?
- That's 20,000 piastres.

211
00:28:29,242 --> 00:28:32,663
Agreed.
- Well done, Doyle.

212
00:28:32,871 --> 00:28:37,418
Mr. Y B'ham is a great choice.
There is a problem.

213
00:28:37,668 --> 00:28:42,673
He stares not because he was so
Wise, he is blind.

214
00:28:42,924 --> 00:28:46,344
Y B'ham not blind. Y B'ham can ...

215
00:28:47,554 --> 00:28:49,681
Y B'ham is blind.

216
00:28:50,932 --> 00:28:53,185
10,000 piastres?

217
00:29:08,701 --> 00:29:10,912
Nice view.

218
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,207
I look 'n elephant in his ass.

219
00:29:27,388 --> 00:29:28,931
Manage it?

220
00:29:29,181 --> 00:29:34,312
I'm Vietnamese, Cambodian,
French tried and Jeh.

221
00:29:37,315 --> 00:29:41,528
Keep him in mind.
- It is high, you see him like that.

222
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:47,242
You understand me. Maybe
our side has his slain family.

223
00:29:47,492 --> 00:29:50,579
We can not trust him.

224
00:29:50,829 --> 00:29:54,375
You're right. Linh not trust.

225
00:29:55,626 --> 00:29:59,755
Linh trust Americans
not, and vice versa.

226
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:03,009
Everything is best in prime order.

227
00:30:24,782 --> 00:30:29,078
That elephant is goodbye
say, huh? Should he take?

228
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:31,497
Why not?

229
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:35,919
It's an elephant.
- Yes, but ...

230
00:30:36,211 --> 00:30:41,258
He can not show a plane.
If he starts moving in a panic ...

231
00:30:41,508 --> 00:30:46,055
... We paid down and we are dead.
- This is important.

232
00:30:47,848 --> 00:30:51,519
He only goes to
board if he is dead.

233
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:56,816
That I can arrange.
Or are you 'm attached?

234
00:30:57,525 --> 00:31:01,362
Linh, nobody Bo Tat
shoot.

235
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:16,003
Got a package for
Poole vet on board?

236
00:31:16,253 --> 00:31:18,089
Indeed.

237
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:29,559
Gentlemen, sleeping animal.
They stir not move.

238
00:31:29,809 --> 00:31:31,728
Bo Tat sleep.

239
00:31:32,062 --> 00:31:37,025
Never mind. I have no
command 's elephant to carry.

240
00:31:37,276 --> 00:31:39,528
Gentlemen, war is fine.

241
00:31:40,821 --> 00:31:44,659
Major, maybe you should
read it again.

242
00:31:48,412 --> 00:31:52,584
This is secret, why did you
We heard nothing about beast.

243
00:31:52,834 --> 00:31:57,088
If someone asks,
you tuna carried.

244
00:31:57,339 --> 00:31:59,091
Tuna?

245
00:32:01,426 --> 00:32:05,305
Transporting an elephant.
- What elephant?

246
00:32:10,436 --> 00:32:13,064
You have ten minutes.

247
00:32:13,314 --> 00:32:17,026
I am responsible
for it laaddek.

248
00:32:17,277 --> 00:32:21,656
If that thing moves,
see you 're flying elephant.

249
00:32:23,116 --> 00:32:25,660
That's funny.

250
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:29,915
What is that letter?

251
00:32:30,165 --> 00:32:34,837
General Westmoreland, highest
priority. About eight.

252
00:32:35,087 --> 00:32:40,426
London Zoo's got elephant
hypnotic, but that takes too long.

253
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,972
What is that?
- Water Buffalo-hypnotic.

254
00:32:44,222 --> 00:32:48,643
Not so much, but when we gave her
give some more, does it well.

255
00:32:53,732 --> 00:32:58,862
Good day, say.
- Now one and one later if necessary.

256
00:32:59,113 --> 00:33:01,448
How do we do?

257
00:33:01,699 --> 00:33:06,412
According to the information
they should not take.

258
00:33:09,457 --> 00:33:11,834
Well, Dr. Poole ...

259
00:33:12,085 --> 00:33:18,258
I help you, but I do not cross
hand in my ass' n elephant.

260
00:33:20,302 --> 00:33:22,221
In three.

261
00:33:26,475 --> 00:33:28,853
What do you have?
- Just.

262
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:38,613
Do not move, large trunk.

263
00:33:43,577 --> 00:33:45,954
What is disgusting.

264
00:33:47,414 --> 00:33:49,333
You're weird.

265
00:33:50,876 --> 00:33:53,337
Well conceived, Poole.

266
00:33:54,255 --> 00:33:59,302
We put her on the plane
before it starts to work stuff.

267
00:34:01,137 --> 00:34:06,184
Linh thought you were joking.
Bo Tat not on plane.

268
00:34:08,019 --> 00:34:11,231
Pardon?
- Does not like Bo Tat.

269
00:34:13,025 --> 00:34:17,071
How often they fly?
- Does not like Bo Tat.

270
00:34:17,279 --> 00:34:19,657
We take 'n truck.
- The plane.

271
00:34:19,782 --> 00:34:22,368
Does not like Bo Tat.

272
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:24,829
I '' t.
- Go ahead.

273
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:28,207
Hurry, or you get
it has not.

274
00:34:28,416 --> 00:34:33,296
You pretty? Think you
prime are best? Poor prime!

275
00:34:33,505 --> 00:34:36,216
You're a bad prime.

276
00:34:58,114 --> 00:35:00,241
Watch your head.

277
00:35:00,492 --> 00:35:03,078
She must lie down.

278
00:35:03,328 --> 00:35:06,123
Otherwise hurt themselves.

279
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,691
Technical knockout.

280
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,821
What are you doing?
- She's fine.

281
00:35:36,071 --> 00:35:40,743
Americans kill everything.
You've killed Bo Tat.

282
00:35:40,993 --> 00:35:44,622
You've killed Bo Tat.

283
00:35:51,337 --> 00:35:53,757
She is fine.

284
00:35:55,884 --> 00:35:58,303
She sleeps alone.

285
00:36:25,123 --> 00:36:28,836
What do you do first
when you get home?

286
00:36:29,169 --> 00:36:33,424
The first? My ma
one big kiss.

287
00:36:33,632 --> 00:36:37,678
And the second?
- Give her Kleenex.

288
00:36:37,887 --> 00:36:44,018
She cries tears down spouts.
And what is waiting for you, Captain?

289
00:36:46,021 --> 00:36:47,939
A hammer.

290
00:36:48,189 --> 00:36:54,196
My brother is roofing. And he wants
like I'm his partner.

291
00:36:54,446 --> 00:37:00,286
I have been long been a soldier.
It is time for real life.

292
00:37:10,129 --> 00:37:12,757
What kiss you?

293
00:37:14,634 --> 00:37:17,763
Oh, nothing.
- Come on, what's that?

294
00:37:18,013 --> 00:37:20,390
It's stupid.

295
00:37:20,641 --> 00:37:25,062
When I came here,
I sat in the administration.

296
00:37:25,312 --> 00:37:31,485
I was scared and nervous, as we
all. I thought of home.

297
00:37:31,736 --> 00:37:36,991
I walked past a Coke machine
and there was a bottle.

298
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:42,164
I have kept the cap,
that brings happiness.

299
00:37:43,498 --> 00:37:45,959
And has it worked?

300
00:37:46,209 --> 00:37:50,714
I do not believe it, but two
years without a scratch ...

301
00:37:50,965 --> 00:37:54,093
I buy 'm.
- No, forget it.

302
00:37:54,343 --> 00:37:56,137
$ 20?

303
00:37:56,387 --> 00:37:59,682
Keep your money.
- $ 40?

304
00:37:59,932 --> 00:38:05,438
If it means so much to you ...
- He just open that bottle.

305
00:38:10,193 --> 00:38:13,322
Captain, the Major wants to see you.

306
00:38:15,574 --> 00:38:20,621
Farley, look at that beautiful beast 's.
How can you not like it?

307
00:38:25,626 --> 00:38:31,216
We have a tough headwind.
Give me that baby I got a dose.

308
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:40,058
Poole, we have the elephant
the second pill.

309
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:44,396
Farley has
'S mishap with it.

310
00:38:49,277 --> 00:38:51,070
How long does it?

311
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:55,742
At 's water buffalo six hours.
Bo Tat is so great as ...

312
00:38:55,992 --> 00:39:00,288
How much time?
- We certainly one hours.

313
00:39:16,931 --> 00:39:19,809
I've counted wrong.

314
00:39:29,403 --> 00:39:31,947
You did, huh?

315
00:39:48,673 --> 00:39:52,344
She's awake.
- What do you do? Dump.

316
00:40:41,229 --> 00:40:44,023
Press the button. Forward.

317
00:40:47,694 --> 00:40:49,780
Shoot her.

318
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:52,825
Close it.
- We go out.

319
00:41:45,172 --> 00:41:47,925
Back in the cockpit.

320
00:42:51,409 --> 00:42:55,079
Wait, you can here me
not leave.

321
00:42:56,873 --> 00:43:00,627
I'm going to call LBJ.
I thought not.

322
00:43:11,806 --> 00:43:15,268
Guys? Guys, wait for me.

323
00:43:36,624 --> 00:43:40,294
Bo Tat scared.
- Do not get lost.

324
00:43:40,544 --> 00:43:44,632
Let me go.
- Then he smears him, or the elephant.

325
00:43:44,882 --> 00:43:50,180
When you did not let go, we
Bo Tat lost. I'll go with him along.

326
00:44:00,566 --> 00:44:02,526
We have each other.

327
00:44:02,651 --> 00:44:07,782
And I will be yours truly
let anything happen.

328
00:44:09,242 --> 00:44:12,870
I said you do not
Aircraft loved Bo Tat.

329
00:44:14,581 --> 00:44:19,795
We have them here
a lesson learned, eh?

330
00:44:25,551 --> 00:44:26,510
Bo Tat ...

331
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:31,390
... I'm sorry that you were afraid.

332
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:34,352
Bo Tat mean American.

333
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:40,316
Bo Tat, we bring you to a pretty
region where they will hold you.

334
00:44:40,984 --> 00:44:45,906
Where the air is cold and fresh,
and the water cool and sweet.

335
00:44:46,114 --> 00:44:51,328
There you from,
and where you belong.

336
00:44:51,537 --> 00:44:53,998
Come on.

337
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:30,662
I saw them from a plane.

338
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:34,290
An elephant, you know for sure?
- Yes.

339
00:45:34,958 --> 00:45:37,460
Why an elephant?

340
00:45:38,461 --> 00:45:40,130
I know.

341
00:45:42,466 --> 00:45:45,636
That is the symbol of
the Republican Party.

342
00:45:46,804 --> 00:45:48,514
Nixon's Republican.

343
00:45:49,139 --> 00:45:50,141
That is crazy.

344
00:45:53,102 --> 00:45:55,688
Say it to Colonel Nguyen.

345
00:45:57,815 --> 00:46:00,151
We're here about.

346
00:46:00,401 --> 00:46:04,698
Tuy Hoa is nearby,
perhaps 15 km.

347
00:46:04,948 --> 00:46:08,201
We can get a truck tomorrow.

348
00:46:09,286 --> 00:46:13,332
240 km with n elephant
middle of the war.

349
00:46:13,582 --> 00:46:15,334
Easy.

350
00:46:15,584 --> 00:46:19,547
Agreed, if you give me
but here lashes out.

351
00:46:19,797 --> 00:46:24,344
I can not stay here.
Send someone to ... Moment.

352
00:46:24,594 --> 00:46:28,473
What are you doing?
- I control what. Beer, steaks ...

353
00:46:28,723 --> 00:46:31,726
... and stretchers, maybe ice cream.

354
00:46:31,977 --> 00:46:35,355
And then I returned to the pilot.

355
00:46:35,606 --> 00:46:39,818
The enemy knows where we are
like a helicopter lands.

356
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:42,196
You have the elephant.

357
00:46:42,446 --> 00:46:47,451
I wanted to go to the beach, and not
worry about snakes.

358
00:46:47,702 --> 00:46:50,246
Snakes?
- It does not belong here.

359
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:53,124
I call General Richardson.

360
00:46:53,458 --> 00:46:56,920
He gives you probably got a new mission.

361
00:46:57,170 --> 00:47:00,841
Get your ration,
This is our home.

362
00:47:03,635 --> 00:47:08,140
Did you now but you geluksdop
had, huh, smart guy?

363
00:47:24,741 --> 00:47:26,702
What are you doing?

364
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:33,167
He goes home. He is lucky
need to arrive safely.

365
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:35,878
You want happiness?

366
00:47:36,337 --> 00:47:40,967
You must have "an old Vietnamese
flessedop sale.

367
00:47:41,217 --> 00:47:43,553
Linh has nothing for sale.

368
00:47:44,429 --> 00:47:48,058
Elephant brings happiness.

369
00:47:48,308 --> 00:47:51,645
If you want happiness,
Bo Tat on tap.

370
00:47:53,981 --> 00:47:55,732
Sure.

371
00:47:59,236 --> 00:48:01,405
What bad luck?

372
00:48:01,655 --> 00:48:06,035
Not whistling in the dark.
Then snake bite you.

373
00:48:07,495 --> 00:48:14,377
Even worse: When the night
an owl will die 's family.

374
00:48:15,921 --> 00:48:18,381
Is that the worst?

375
00:48:18,799 --> 00:48:23,262
Owl's nothing compared to crow.
If you see crow ...

376
00:48:23,512 --> 00:48:27,266
... is that many accident.
- What happens?

377
00:48:27,516 --> 00:48:32,605
If you have a large black bird
see you run.

378
00:48:37,569 --> 00:48:43,783
You know, this is a beautiful country.
I am really impressed.

379
00:48:43,992 --> 00:48:47,329
Yes, very nice. I am
thinking of home.

380
00:48:47,579 --> 00:48:50,874
You got a lot of rice fields?

381
00:48:51,125 --> 00:48:53,502
That you have in Arkansas.

382
00:48:53,794 --> 00:48:57,673
Tell me what you here
home-like.

383
00:48:57,923 --> 00:49:02,387
The crushing humidity?
The nasty bugs?

384
00:49:02,637 --> 00:49:08,810
Or fine feeling that any moment
A bullet in your forehead can land?

385
00:49:10,437 --> 00:49:14,608
I'm talking crazy feeling
you 're not like.

386
00:49:14,858 --> 00:49:18,112
I think it's crazy, like everyone else.

387
00:49:18,362 --> 00:49:23,075
But you are the only American
who prefer elsewhere.

388
00:49:30,875 --> 00:49:33,169
Come on, give me ...

389
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:39,551
Hurry up.

390
00:49:41,053 --> 00:49:44,515
Where you going?
- They will help.

391
00:49:45,641 --> 00:49:49,145
Golly. Cahill,
understand me well.

392
00:49:49,395 --> 00:49:55,485
I would like good deeds,
but we must arrange a truck.

393
00:49:55,735 --> 00:49:59,531
It does not take long.
Later delivers it somewhat.

394
00:50:02,826 --> 00:50:05,829
Maybe you get the stump.

395
00:50:06,663 --> 00:50:12,086
Go hang, but the benefactor, I
Go to the road to do a job.

396
00:50:12,294 --> 00:50:15,297
Go and have fun.

397
00:50:15,881 --> 00:50:21,220
They go with the elephant to the roof NHE
to replace the dead elephant?

398
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:24,140
That you had slain.

399
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:29,396
We make sure that the Americans
fulfill their promise.

400
00:50:30,689 --> 00:50:34,735
Therefore, they Roof nhe
absolutely not make.

401
00:50:39,156 --> 00:50:42,743
Where is everybody?
- They come back.

402
00:50:44,745 --> 00:50:47,874
What a blunt.
- America won today.

403
00:50:48,166 --> 00:50:50,543
Without shooting.

404
00:50:50,793 --> 00:50:54,839
We lost two hours
and we have no truck.

405
00:50:55,090 --> 00:51:00,846
How about an old diesel
with a large bucket? Is that good?

406
00:51:08,062 --> 00:51:10,856
That is development aid.

407
00:51:11,107 --> 00:51:16,654
They can not buy fuel.
We got him from got them.

408
00:51:31,587 --> 00:51:36,509
How long have you Bo Tat?
- Forever. She was my father.

409
00:51:36,759 --> 00:51:41,431
What happened to your father?
- He died.

410
00:51:42,932 --> 00:51:45,560
How did that happen?

411
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:49,773
Was it us?

412
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:51,775
No idea.

413
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:55,404
I hope it does not.

414
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:03,913
Colonel, I have the Americans
and found the elephant.

415
00:52:04,205 --> 00:52:06,624
They will not leave here.

416
00:52:36,072 --> 00:52:39,451
The radiator is leaking, I make him shut.

417
00:52:41,161 --> 00:52:43,580
What do you need?

418
00:52:43,872 --> 00:52:49,044
I need to Saigon. These men
have captured me.

419
00:52:49,294 --> 00:52:53,883
Poole, I speak the language well.
- I was "kidding.

420
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:57,720
I call again and you know who.

421
00:52:59,555 --> 00:53:02,684
We need food for
have the elephant.

422
00:53:07,522 --> 00:53:09,858
Bo Tat must move.

423
00:53:10,108 --> 00:53:13,820
Feed, water. She is hungry.

424
00:53:14,655 --> 00:53:16,407
They are thirsty.

425
00:53:17,074 --> 00:53:19,285
Now.
- Good, good.

426
00:53:22,246 --> 00:53:28,378
Farley, bring her to the fountain
to drink. We introduce her later.

427
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:39,556
Bo Tat, what you eat, honey?

428
00:53:45,187 --> 00:53:47,314
One minute.

429
00:53:47,606 --> 00:53:51,486
Hurry up, will soon be
we chased away.

430
00:53:51,778 --> 00:53:53,488
Moment.

431
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:57,909
Surround them and attack
If I give the word.

432
00:54:08,212 --> 00:54:11,048
Farley, where does she go?

433
00:54:14,093 --> 00:54:17,555
Captain Doyle,
Captain Cahill, help.

434
00:54:32,279 --> 00:54:36,325
Linh, who love elephants.
- Come back.

435
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:53,176
Beware the elephant.

436
00:55:09,694 --> 00:55:13,698
Sorry about your chicken.
- Turn now to the elephant.

437
00:55:15,617 --> 00:55:18,912
We must end
with the elephant.

438
00:55:19,204 --> 00:55:21,289
Turn it around.

439
00:55:30,549 --> 00:55:32,551
This way.

440
00:56:04,919 --> 00:56:06,629
Forward.

441
00:56:07,714 --> 00:56:09,549
We have ...

442
00:56:35,243 --> 00:56:36,953
Forward.

443
00:57:13,909 --> 00:57:15,786
Give your hand.

444
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:21,500
Wait for me.
- Captain, slowly.

445
00:57:26,464 --> 00:57:28,466
Run, Farley.

446
00:57:47,278 --> 00:57:50,740
Sounds bad.
- We can not stop.

447
00:57:50,990 --> 00:57:55,495
They are behind us.
There were North Vietnamese.

448
00:57:55,745 --> 00:58:00,709
They do not stand out,
but they have the same haircut.

449
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:23,858
Where will he go? Where you going?
- To Saigon.

450
00:58:24,192 --> 00:58:27,654
Come back.
- I call General Richardson.

451
00:58:27,946 --> 00:58:33,452
Yes, Cahill, but the general call.
I will be here before you run.

452
00:58:33,744 --> 00:58:36,872
I'm really sick of me ...

453
00:58:40,668 --> 00:58:42,753
Well it is enough.

454
00:58:43,045 --> 00:58:47,175
I almost crashed
I'm almost lynched ...

455
00:58:47,467 --> 00:58:50,220
... my suit is covered with shit.

456
00:58:50,428 --> 00:58:56,894
For my part tell Richardson
I've slept with his wife.

457
00:59:01,857 --> 00:59:04,151
Wait a minute.

458
00:59:04,443 --> 00:59:07,697
The wife of
Richardson war horse?

459
00:59:07,989 --> 00:59:13,912
I thought it was his daughter.
- Yes, he had pretty well found.

460
00:59:16,164 --> 00:59:19,501
Poole, Saigon is the other way.

461
00:59:19,751 --> 00:59:25,549
The nearest village is Hau
Bon, 45 km upstream.

462
00:59:25,841 --> 00:59:30,387
You will only alive,
if you stay with us.

463
00:59:46,696 --> 00:59:49,241
He is overheated.

464
00:59:52,453 --> 00:59:54,830
What do we do now?

465
00:59:55,122 --> 00:59:59,418
Waiting. There will be
a resolution passed.

466
01:00:00,419 --> 01:00:05,466
My motto is: Have faith.
- And mine Explosives, and a lot.

467
01:00:07,469 --> 01:00:10,847
Loading mines and grenades in the truck.

468
01:00:11,139 --> 01:00:15,894
Mine at the door. If the
North Vietnamese coming, boom.

469
01:00:16,186 --> 01:00:19,898
With some luck, the road bridge.
- Happiness? For whom?

470
01:00:20,190 --> 01:00:24,570
People use the bridge.
- It's a war on.

471
01:00:24,904 --> 01:00:29,200
The NVA is behind us,
and that but with a purpose.

472
01:00:29,492 --> 01:00:33,705
Kill us. Their lives
my responsibility.

473
01:00:33,997 --> 01:00:38,877
I'm not into that as farmers
can not cross the bridge.

474
01:00:39,169 --> 01:00:43,924
However, the NVA as a first here?
If the school be?

475
01:00:44,216 --> 01:00:50,139
Have you thought of? And why
not? Guys if you think not.

476
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:54,060
I do not? What about you?

477
01:00:54,685 --> 01:01:00,358
We are risking all our lives
so you have a clean conscience does.

478
01:01:00,567 --> 01:01:05,906
You're afraid that if you are on the roof
sitting and looking back on your career ...

479
01:01:06,156 --> 01:01:11,203
... that 's not like what you see.
That erases everything Vietnam.

480
01:01:11,453 --> 01:01:14,915
You want a good deed
do before you leave.

481
01:01:15,165 --> 01:01:20,213
That is: a child from a
burning building pulling, but this.

482
01:01:20,463 --> 01:01:27,846
And we are involved.
There's no thought, huh?

483
01:01:28,054 --> 01:01:33,560
Why not? Because boys
if you do not think.

484
01:01:50,495 --> 01:01:53,039
Come, SIRS. Apart, SIRS.

485
01:01:58,211 --> 01:02:01,632
Pull me up.
- Give me your hand.

486
01:02:07,429 --> 01:02:09,140
Everything good?

487
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:24,447
Glad I stayed.

488
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:34,041
At the risk of the enemy-I
Reopen ties, what do we do?

489
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:37,169
I said: Have faith.

490
01:03:19,172 --> 01:03:22,259
Are my ears
whether you sing so bad now?

491
01:03:22,467 --> 01:03:25,929
Your ears. I always sang so bad.

492
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:30,559
Have faith, mumbo jumbo.
You knew he was coming.

493
01:03:30,810 --> 01:03:33,563
I was first in Hau Bon.

494
01:03:33,813 --> 01:03:38,026
Every Wednesday were Mr. Goddard
and Marie Antoinette along.

495
01:03:38,276 --> 01:03:42,322
He gave us good information
the Vietcong.

496
01:03:42,530 --> 01:03:45,534
I just love America.

497
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:54,043
You also gave the Vietcong
good information about us.

498
01:03:54,293 --> 01:03:59,090
I can not help. I love
everyone. Wine anyone?

499
01:03:59,298 --> 01:04:02,635
Wine? We are sometimes in a gallery?

500
01:04:02,844 --> 01:04:07,724
We liberate the oppressed.
Not drinking and partying.

501
01:04:07,974 --> 01:04:10,560
Now.

502
01:04:11,478 --> 01:04:13,689
What have I done?

503
01:04:13,939 --> 01:04:16,775
I need top-commands
on path ...

504
01:04:16,984 --> 01:04:22,031
... not Dumbo, Mr. French
and the Three Stooges.

505
01:04:31,791 --> 01:04:34,794
D'ng lai, which means 'stop'.

506
01:04:36,338 --> 01:04:39,925
Dee, that means 'go'.

507
01:04:40,676 --> 01:04:42,928
Try it.

508
01:04:49,477 --> 01:04:53,689
Well done. You know two
key words al

509
01:04:53,898 --> 01:04:56,401
And what is the third?

510
01:04:57,610 --> 01:05:00,613
It means "get off me".

511
01:05:03,992 --> 01:05:10,499
Do you remember that sleep on?
- That was you really like, huh?

512
01:05:11,583 --> 01:05:14,587
Linh was right, you're weird.

513
01:05:15,963 --> 01:05:23,263
I can get as much as you want.
- Tonight we passed Pon Hau.

514
01:05:23,471 --> 01:05:28,518
We'll show a path that does not
hands of the enemy.

515
01:05:28,685 --> 01:05:30,061
And so to Pleiku.

516
01:05:30,270 --> 01:05:36,443
Friday, we fly to Bo Tat
Roof NHE. In the afternoon she is there.

517
01:05:36,693 --> 01:05:38,487
Easy.

518
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:42,700
Decks.

519
01:05:50,375 --> 01:05:52,752
Cover all costs.

520
01:05:56,798 --> 01:06:00,677
Do not shoot
they are out of reach.

521
01:06:03,555 --> 01:06:07,935
They hit us so. I know,
I'm in the artillery.

522
01:06:08,185 --> 01:06:10,771
You have to zigzag.

523
01:06:19,698 --> 01:06:22,242
Keep moving.

524
01:06:36,465 --> 01:06:41,512
What did Bo Tat?
- She's hurt here.

525
01:06:41,763 --> 01:06:43,389
She was seasick.

526
01:06:46,643 --> 01:06:48,770
She will puke.

527
01:06:57,571 --> 01:07:03,244
My child asks later, "What was it
worst? I know it well.

528
01:07:11,753 --> 01:07:15,340
Can you faster?

529
01:07:15,549 --> 01:07:21,054
Soon my boat goes to the basement.
- Maybe not.

530
01:07:26,185 --> 01:07:32,358
Gilman, who had me head you can
deliver? That was just "kidding.

531
01:07:32,567 --> 01:07:34,527
I love you as a brother.

532
01:07:35,194 --> 01:07:40,158
Are you crazy? Where can I find
a Triumph Spitfire? Dirty rat.

533
01:07:40,450 --> 01:07:44,413
Sorry, my apologies.
Well, agreed.

534
01:07:45,622 --> 01:07:50,336
Put him with artillery.
A direct line.

535
01:07:50,586 --> 01:07:53,047
Go ahead. Dirty ...

536
01:07:53,339 --> 01:07:55,800
Here. Stay tuned.

537
01:07:58,135 --> 01:08:03,266
We are on the Song Ba, the NVA is
with a boat behind us.

538
01:08:03,558 --> 01:08:08,772
Yes, Hotel Alpha. Who is
I? Barney? Hey, how are you?

539
01:08:09,022 --> 01:08:12,526
We need your help, pronto.

540
01:08:12,818 --> 01:08:15,529
We need artillery.

541
01:08:15,779 --> 01:08:21,285
Bravo fire in ordinates Romeo
35,411,059. Once to highlight it.

542
01:08:31,713 --> 01:08:36,176
That was perfect, Barney.
- No, he almost hit us.

543
01:08:36,426 --> 01:08:41,932
We move, the coordinates are
perfect as she ... Fire directed.

544
01:08:42,599 --> 01:08:44,476
Now.

545
01:08:48,272 --> 01:08:50,483
The boat off.

546
01:09:00,368 --> 01:09:04,414
You now called the Brown BOMBERS.

547
01:09:29,941 --> 01:09:32,653
You want him to try?

548
01:09:49,462 --> 01:09:51,423
I have a place to sleep.

549
01:10:27,461 --> 01:10:33,718
What is this place?
- An ancient temple.

550
01:10:34,010 --> 01:10:37,847
'S Buddhist Temple?
- A Tam Giao Temple.

551
01:10:38,014 --> 01:10:42,393
What Buddhism, which
Confucianism and what Tao.

552
01:10:57,451 --> 01:11:01,038
And those elephants?

553
01:11:01,289 --> 01:11:04,625
The elephant god Tam Giao.

554
01:11:05,293 --> 01:11:08,963
No god, father god.

555
01:11:10,423 --> 01:11:17,806
In the beginning were white elephants.
They flew into the air with the clouds.

556
01:11:20,225 --> 01:11:24,772
It went 'n elephant down
and crept into Queen Maya ...

557
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:28,401
... while they slept.

558
01:11:28,609 --> 01:11:34,616
She had a baby, Prince Siddhartha,
Gautama the Buddha.

559
01:11:34,866 --> 01:11:37,869
Elephant god father.

560
01:12:06,650 --> 01:12:13,073
Linh, that was a great story.
Flying elephants, which was very good.

561
01:12:13,323 --> 01:12:19,580
But you might as well start with:
"In the beginning, black elephant."

562
01:12:20,373 --> 01:12:26,170
The only possibility is this path
after the Pleiku.

563
01:12:26,379 --> 01:12:30,592
Is that only safe?
- I do not know.

564
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:36,431
We can ask, or create
Americans-with-elephant suspicion?

565
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:40,686
We can send Linh.
Nobody suspects him.

566
01:12:40,894 --> 01:12:46,984
You can not. You know why.
We can not take that risk.

567
01:12:53,616 --> 01:12:55,493
I will go.

568
01:13:23,273 --> 01:13:30,405
I do not care who your family
murdered. You probably also not.

569
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:37,746
Vietcong killed the mother and sister.
Linh know who killed father.

570
01:13:38,789 --> 01:13:43,753
Linh and father went home.
There was a big light.

571
01:13:44,712 --> 01:13:52,178
Everything happened quickly, people call.
Shooting. Father loves Linh down.

572
01:13:52,429 --> 01:13:56,183
Bo Tat runs. They shoot
Bo Tat down.

573
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:04,984
Father Linh and countries apart.
Father runs to Linh, falls down.

574
01:14:05,901 --> 01:14:09,280
He shot.
Linh moving.

575
01:14:09,864 --> 01:14:12,492
Bo Linh Tat rescues.

576
01:14:12,742 --> 01:14:18,290
Men shoot at Bo Tat many times.
Bo Tat goes very far.

577
01:14:21,084 --> 01:14:24,087
Bo Tat save me.

578
01:14:46,945 --> 01:14:49,656
Were you injured?

579
01:14:49,865 --> 01:14:54,745
You said you could not move.
- That was because I was too scared.

580
01:14:54,954 --> 01:15:00,835
Therefore father died, I too scared.
- Why is he not died.

581
01:15:01,085 --> 01:15:05,340
Of course you were scared.
I would have. Everyone.

582
01:15:05,506 --> 01:15:09,803
Linh, it was not your fault.
- From whom?

583
01:15:10,011 --> 01:15:11,972
People.

584
01:15:14,224 --> 01:15:17,811
People far away.

585
01:15:18,020 --> 01:15:23,067
People who never have been.
- Linh does not understand.

586
01:15:31,743 --> 01:15:36,206
How did you get in Ban Don?
- With American note.

587
01:15:36,456 --> 01:15:41,962
He said he take me to the mountains
brings back. He lied.

588
01:15:43,839 --> 01:15:47,885
I'll take you back to the hills.

589
01:15:49,136 --> 01:15:51,097
I promise.

590
01:16:05,612 --> 01:16:10,075
Linh father was a good father,
a prime best father.

591
01:16:10,284 --> 01:16:13,287
I like to think that.

592
01:16:24,340 --> 01:16:27,343
I like to think that.

593
01:17:08,888 --> 01:17:11,182
Is it safe path to Pleiku?

594
01:17:11,474 --> 01:17:15,686
Yes, the path is safe.
There is no Vietcong.

595
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:42,965
I had to pee.

596
01:17:43,174 --> 01:17:46,511
I wanted to desecrate the temple.
- Never mind.

597
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:51,725
He sat down to eat out.
They learn quickly that we are here.

598
01:17:51,933 --> 01:17:55,854
I will visit him out.
- The elephant needs to Pleiku.

599
01:17:56,063 --> 01:18:01,652
How do we walk Bo?
- Linh Farley has learned.

600
01:18:01,902 --> 01:18:04,655
Of course not.

601
01:18:04,864 --> 01:18:07,825
Well, he has it taught me.

602
01:18:08,034 --> 01:18:12,413
Take someone with you.
- I 've messed up, I go.

603
01:18:23,509 --> 01:18:25,678
That's crazy.

604
01:18:25,886 --> 01:18:28,848
My legs do not want anymore.

605
01:18:29,014 --> 01:18:30,433
Then I'll go.

606
01:18:32,476 --> 01:18:34,437
He has my watch.

607
01:18:38,233 --> 01:18:43,280
Where are your American friends?
- I have not.

608
01:19:16,315 --> 01:19:19,777
Leave her a leg
drop. We go.

609
01:19:20,486 --> 01:19:25,825
I do not know that command. Help me.
- Grab the gun here.

610
01:19:26,033 --> 01:19:28,870
Your foot on my leg. Help your mind?

611
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:32,332
In three. One, two, three.

612
01:19:33,792 --> 01:19:35,543
Push.

613
01:19:35,710 --> 01:19:38,714
I sit on it.
- Well done.

614
01:19:38,922 --> 01:19:41,383
I do not know.

615
01:19:42,509 --> 01:19:45,429
She says she's ready.
- No, angry.

616
01:19:51,018 --> 01:19:54,731
This way. We go around.

617
01:19:54,939 --> 01:19:57,942
This side.
- I can not run.

618
01:19:58,151 --> 01:20:02,197
Stop her.
- Good, good. Dee.

619
01:20:02,405 --> 01:20:04,866
I mean dee d'ng.

620
01:20:06,743 --> 01:20:09,746
Tell my ma I love her.

621
01:20:50,957 --> 01:20:53,334
Stop, you idiot beast.

622
01:21:18,570 --> 01:21:22,073
Farley, good mahout.

623
01:21:31,375 --> 01:21:33,460
Everything good?

624
01:21:41,678 --> 01:21:46,558
They got him pretty good had.
- He has beaten me so often.

625
01:21:46,766 --> 01:21:51,688
When I told you in
Hau Bon were, he believed.

626
01:21:51,897 --> 01:21:55,234
That we were Hau Bon?

627
01:22:01,741 --> 01:22:08,122
Why are you here go?
- You wanted to know if path was safe.

628
01:22:08,289 --> 01:22:14,296
Linh can only ask. For Linh
arrested, he told safe path.

629
01:22:15,130 --> 01:22:16,423
Linh Do you trust now?

630
01:22:22,888 --> 01:22:25,891
I trust Linh.

631
01:22:36,194 --> 01:22:39,197
Hug a lot.

632
01:23:27,498 --> 01:23:30,210
Deleted?

633
01:23:30,418 --> 01:23:37,592
How can the mission be deleted?
- We have the village do not need.

634
01:23:39,761 --> 01:23:46,060
When you were on safari,
the Ho Chi Minh trail moved.

635
01:23:46,268 --> 01:23:51,232
The village has no strategic importance.
- No strategic interest?

636
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:55,403
Major Pederson, sir.
We're almost there.

637
01:23:55,653 --> 01:23:57,906
Please let us finish.

638
01:23:58,114 --> 01:24:00,992
We fly the elephant ...
- Where?

639
01:24:01,201 --> 01:24:06,790
The runway in the village?
Recently destroyed by NVA.

640
01:24:06,999 --> 01:24:12,087
You can no countries
the elephant. End of mission.

641
01:24:12,296 --> 01:24:16,259
Bo Linh Tat, and And then?

642
01:24:16,467 --> 01:24:23,183
The boy and the elephant, sir.
- Bring them back.

643
01:24:31,942 --> 01:24:35,446
Where you going?
- I Can not say.

644
01:24:35,654 --> 01:24:40,743
Then you will like me. Do you love me
in return, be it war.

645
01:24:40,951 --> 01:24:45,957
The mission has been deleted.
This is the captain ignored.

646
01:24:46,165 --> 01:24:51,004
Will you steal a truck?
- If necessary.

647
01:24:52,672 --> 01:24:56,718
Why not steal
once an airplane?

648
01:24:57,928 --> 01:25:03,100
Do you worry about the land?
We do not have to land.

649
01:25:03,309 --> 01:25:08,147
Remember when I said:
Give them show a tractor.

650
01:25:08,356 --> 01:25:11,234
How did we
'S tractor yet?

651
01:25:11,359 --> 01:25:15,655
Tractors do not have to land.

652
01:25:18,616 --> 01:25:21,620
Well, we need parachutes ...
- We?

653
01:25:21,828 --> 01:25:23,497
Yes, Captain.

654
01:25:24,414 --> 01:25:25,457
We.

655
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:29,878
HA, Farley, do you take?

656
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:40,932
If you're the elephant to NHE Roof
, it is your career be over.

657
01:25:43,017 --> 01:25:49,566
Maybe we all have a
good thing for us to leave.

658
01:26:05,333 --> 01:26:10,171
Which way did they go?
- Over the mountains to Pleiku.

659
01:27:37,598 --> 01:27:40,851
Insane. Bo Tat is not a tractor.

660
01:27:41,101 --> 01:27:44,271
Now we hear 't really feel
by talking?

661
01:27:44,939 --> 01:27:48,150
I feel sorry for her.

662
01:27:48,442 --> 01:27:50,653
Tell anyone I said that.

663
01:27:50,862 --> 01:27:55,200
Secret, even without
permission from the tower.

664
01:27:55,408 --> 01:27:59,704
No radio, no one knows what.
This was not done.

665
01:28:09,465 --> 01:28:13,719
They 've stolen 123.
Five minutes ago.

666
01:28:13,970 --> 01:28:20,768
Damn, tell them to return.
It sits there full of NVA artillery.

667
01:28:20,977 --> 01:28:27,442
An enemy unit comes
Pleiku. Immediate destruction.

668
01:28:40,164 --> 01:28:44,210
Do not worry.
- I've never jumped.

669
01:28:44,419 --> 01:28:48,214
They do not. Does she push?

670
01:28:50,467 --> 01:28:53,470
The parachutes and Bo Tat
the crate open automatically.

671
01:28:53,678 --> 01:28:57,474
This line immediately gets
the parachutes open.

672
01:28:57,724 --> 01:29:00,853
Three of you jumping for Bo Tat.

673
01:29:01,103 --> 01:29:05,816
Ten and counting freefall
then withdraw. Understood?

674
01:29:07,944 --> 01:29:14,617
If you get confused in Bo Tat's
wires. And go to their lands.

675
01:29:14,826 --> 01:29:20,707
Cahill and I remain on board until
Bo Tat away. Then we go.

676
01:29:20,916 --> 01:29:24,169
Any Questions?
- Will also Linh?

677
01:29:24,378 --> 01:29:27,172
No, you stay on board.

678
01:29:27,381 --> 01:29:31,635
Linh can take mine
and I remain on board.

679
01:29:31,844 --> 01:29:36,724
Lin Bo Tat goes with it.
- That's too dangerous.

680
01:29:36,933 --> 01:29:40,103
Linh you promise and
Bo Tat home.

681
01:29:40,311 --> 01:29:43,690
Yes, you see Bo Tat
about a couple of days.

682
01:29:43,898 --> 01:29:49,571
But you must first back.
- You lie, you lie.

683
01:29:57,329 --> 01:29:58,914
You're right.

684
01:30:00,207 --> 01:30:06,798
I said I would bring you home
and I do. I keep on board.

685
01:30:08,925 --> 01:30:13,513
I'll take you back to
the mountains and Bo Tat.

686
01:30:13,722 --> 01:30:17,351
You can now not just with her.

687
01:30:27,111 --> 01:30:29,197
One more.

688
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:38,540
Go under the radar.
- This is not a fighter.

689
01:31:05,110 --> 01:31:10,699
You can not jump at this height.
- Near the village, we fly higher.

690
01:31:11,575 --> 01:31:14,286
No, now go fly higher.

691
01:31:27,842 --> 01:31:30,845
We all leap.
- But just above the village.

692
01:31:34,766 --> 01:31:37,436
We go now.
- Get ready.

693
01:32:16,269 --> 01:32:20,273
Change of plan.
- We are approaching the village.

694
01:32:28,490 --> 01:32:30,868
Staandebij.

695
01:32:33,329 --> 01:32:35,080
Ready?

696
01:32:35,331 --> 01:32:36,916
Forward.

697
01:32:37,166 --> 01:32:40,419
I can not, I forgot something.

698
01:32:40,670 --> 01:32:44,632
I'm an office clerk,
I work in my office.

699
01:32:48,845 --> 01:32:51,097
Great, huh?

700
01:32:51,515 --> 01:32:53,225
Here goes.

701
01:32:54,935 --> 01:32:57,646
Is this fun, Poole?

702
01:33:34,143 --> 01:33:36,521
Hold on.

703
01:33:52,371 --> 01:33:54,790
Hold on.

704
01:34:07,137 --> 01:34:08,305
Pak 'm.

705
01:34:20,609 --> 01:34:22,987
Hang, Bo Tat.

706
01:35:34,813 --> 01:35:38,442
I suppose the goal in sight.

707
01:35:43,072 --> 01:35:46,659
Target in sight.
I await your command.

708
01:35:46,868 --> 01:35:49,996
Quang Comrade?

709
01:35:56,670 --> 01:35:58,672
Let him go.

710
01:35:58,922 --> 01:36:05,804
I do not want to shoot elephants,
certainly not flying elephants.

711
01:36:26,743 --> 01:36:30,539
God, save me and I will
never lie.

712
01:36:37,713 --> 01:36:42,468
Farley, you're dead. I swear,
I'll murder you.

713
01:36:50,185 --> 01:36:53,146
Linh loves embrace.

714
01:37:11,666 --> 01:37:13,168
Careful.

715
01:37:13,752 --> 01:37:16,296
Everybody back.

716
01:37:32,814 --> 01:37:36,901
Is she okay?
- All best prime order.

717
01:37:40,530 --> 01:37:43,950
Where is HA?
- Give me a ladder.

718
01:37:47,538 --> 01:37:51,625
Backwards, Linh.
- Get ready for the ceremony.

719
01:38:03,638 --> 01:38:06,433
Drop your weapons.

720
01:38:15,609 --> 01:38:21,115
You spend far elephant.
Admirable, congratulations.

721
01:38:21,365 --> 01:38:26,204
Pity you the trouble
to have done nothing.

722
01:38:29,916 --> 01:38:32,377
Vogel, thunder momentarily.

723
01:38:33,670 --> 01:38:36,256
Elephant will die.

724
01:38:38,216 --> 01:38:40,719
Drop your weapons.

725
01:39:34,401 --> 01:39:37,321
Understood, Whiskey Tango. About.

726
01:39:37,571 --> 01:39:39,949
Crossbow 6 close.

727
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:43,202
What did he say?

728
01:39:43,452 --> 01:39:49,083
The good news is that you are a hero
because you've caught Nguyen.

729
01:39:49,334 --> 01:39:50,877
And it bad?

730
01:39:51,044 --> 01:39:57,134
Photo Explorers report that the path
weather is here. You should continue.

731
01:40:01,889 --> 01:40:04,433
That's bad news.

732
01:40:20,325 --> 01:40:24,997
I must go now, Linh.
- Do you not like it here?

733
01:40:26,290 --> 01:40:32,379
I find it enjoyable.
Better than I ever have been.

734
01:40:33,547 --> 01:40:36,050
You may not Linh.

735
01:40:36,843 --> 01:40:41,931
You know that's not true.
- Why do you go?

736
01:40:45,018 --> 01:40:49,189
Like you had to go back
to where you heard ...

737
01:40:49,439 --> 01:40:53,068
... I must return
to where I belong.

738
01:41:19,304 --> 01:41:21,724
Forget your Linh?

739
01:41:24,143 --> 01:41:28,189
If I forget to breathe.

740
01:41:43,538 --> 01:41:45,499
Hang, Linh.

741
01:41:46,083 --> 01:41:49,211
Good journey home.
- Good luck.

742
01:41:51,797 --> 01:41:56,636
I also hope to have command.
- Well done, soldier.

743
01:41:58,846 --> 01:42:01,432
If you need something ...

744
01:42:26,459 --> 01:42:30,338
If you and your brother
on a roof ...

745
01:42:31,256 --> 01:42:34,509
... Enjoy your down what you see.

746
01:43:02,330 --> 01:43:04,750
Will you take Bo Tat?

747
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:08,379
I will him fit. Have fun.
