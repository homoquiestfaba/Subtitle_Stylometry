1
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,071
Tired of the same old you?

2
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,073
Tired of being out of shape
and out of luck with the opposite sex?

3
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,630
Tired of being overweight
and under-attractive?

4
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,199
Yeah.

5
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,952
Oh, hello.

6
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,353
I'm White Goodman, owner, operator
and founder of Globo Gym America Corp.

7
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,353
I'm here to tell ya that you don't have
to be stuck with what you've got.

8
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,908
Hey, Rory. Looking good.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,279
At Globo Gym we that understand "ugliness"
and "fatness" are genetic disorders,

10
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,635
much like baldness or necrophilia,

11
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,633
and it's only your fault if you don't hate
yourself enough to do something about it.

12
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,314
That's where we come in.

13
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,517
Globo Gym employs
a highly trained, quasi-cultural staff

14
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,433
of personal alteration specialists.

15
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,353
With our competitively priced
onsite cosmetic surgery,

16
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,512
we can turn that Frankenstein
you see in the mirror every morning

17
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,591
into a Franken-fine.

18
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,470
Of course, you'll still be you in a legal sense,

19
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,154
but think of it as a thinner,
more attractive, better you

20
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,231
than you could ever become without us.

21
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,074
How do I know?
Well, I'm not only the founder of Globo Gym,

22
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,071
I'm also a client.

23
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,389
That's me, six years and 600lbs ago,
before I knew how much I hated myself.

24
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,948
That all changed once I founded Globo Gym.

25
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:49,513
But don'tjust take my word for it. Listen
to these Globo gymers tell you how it is...

26
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,434
That feels good.

27
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,715
Oh, the tickle machine.

28
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,916
Crash, no. Crash, out.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,389
Bad dog. No grundle.

30
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,670
Come on down and join the winning team,

31
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,877
because here at Globo Gym,
we're better than you.

32
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,076
And we know it.

33
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,151
Spare me.

34
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,477
Mr La Fleur, this is Doris
from the Department of Water and Power.

35
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,870
We've been trying to reach you,
but your phone was disconnected.

36
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,350
We'll be shutting off
your water and power at 5pm today

37
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,639
due to an eight-month overdue account.
Thank you and have a nice day.

38
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,759
This is Seth from Videorama.
The following DVDs are now overdue.

39
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,790
<i>Drunken Hussies 3, Backdoor Patrol 5</i>
and <i>Mona Lisa Smile.</i> Thank you.

40
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,393
Come on, baby, be there.
Be there.

41
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,190
It's gonna be a good day.
I'm proud of you.

42
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:34,196
We're just around the corner.
My gym's here. I promise we're almost there.

43
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,077
You guys are lifesavers.

44
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,072
I appreciate the effort.
Don't pull a hammy over it.

45
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,675
Gimme that garbage.
Shouldn't you be on a treadmill?

46
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,349
Hey, Peter.

47
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,989
- How's my little tax shelter this morning?
- Everything's shipshape.

48
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,356
Don't hold out on me. What's happening?

49
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,353
It's just I'm trying
this new voicemail-dating thing.

50
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,592
And, like, no one's even left me a message,
and it's been almost two months.

51
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,148
There's someone out there for everybody.

52
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,832
- You think?
- Absolutely.

53
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,436
In some cases, there's two somebodies for
one person. I like to call that "the jackpot".

54
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,511
See you later, dater.

55
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,316
- Hey, Peter.
- Hey, Gordon.

56
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,709
- I'm wailing on my glutes.
- Sounds great.

57
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,839
I'm gonna shock the biceps later,
then some cardio. Keep the body guessing.

58
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,152
- I like to keep my body guessing.
- Sure. I wanted to ask you something.

59
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,834
- Did you catch the game last night?
- Can I say yes?

60
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,434
Amateur curling championships
on ESPN8.

61
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,796
- I had no idea.
- You missed a doozy. Really great stuff.

62
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,678
I feel dumb for asking,
but how did you hear about it?

63
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,275
<i>- OSQ. Obscure Sports Quarterly.</i>
- Of course, the <i>OSQ.</i>

64
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,920
Started reading it in college, for the chicks.

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,594
- I'm glad that worked out for you.
- Thanks, Peter.

66
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,148
- Bye.
- Love the orange and love the headphones.

67
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,708
When I come back,
I want you on a different machine.

68
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,475
- You need a spot?
- I'm cool, Pete.

69
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,393
OK, come on. Let's get this out of here.
You OK?

70
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,598
- You're like a human Chinese puzzle.
- Thanks, Pete.

71
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,910
All that weight is dangerous.

72
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,357
It'll be worth it when I make the cheerleading
squad. Prove to Amber that I'm not a loser.

73
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,036
Hang on a second. You wanna become
a cheerleader to prove you are not a loser?

74
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,509
Yeah. Why?

75
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,273
Nothing. High school's
changed a bit since I was a kid.

76
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,239
Plus, all anyone ever remembers is
what happened at last year's tryouts.

77
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,311
I'm the laughing stock of the school.

78
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,349
I'm sure it's not that big of a deal.
What happened at last year's tryouts?

79
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,395
Justin Redmond. Ready and super-psyched.

80
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,912
- Hey, Amber.
- Hi, Justin. Good luck.

81
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,754
Good luck to you, making yourjudgments.

82
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,276
And from the girls' line,
we need girl number

83
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,796
00, Martha Johnstone.

84
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,389
Toss to hands, liberty and cradle out, OK?

85
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,949
I'm not wearing any panties.

86
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,195
Ready? One, two.

87
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,951
Liberty, ready?

88
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,954
- Dude.
- Can he breathe?

89
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,991
- Wow.
- Yeah.

90
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,437
- It was the worst.
- Don't worry about this Amber situation.

91
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,512
- It'll all work itself out in the end.
- Thanks, Pete.

92
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,830
You'll laugh at this one day.
I'm laughing.

93
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,912
Go at your own pace.
That's what it's there for.

94
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,549
- Who goes there?
- It's me. It's Peter.

95
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,833
'Tis about the matter of payment
for me membership.

96
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,831
Steve be a touch short this month.

97
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,990
That's all right.
Just pay me when you get the money.

98
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:17,312
The dread pirate Steve be in no man's debt.
I'll make a barter with you.

99
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:23,111
In exchange for your kindness,
I'll be splitting me buried treasure with you.

100
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,156
Once I find it, that be.

101
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,268
I'm flattered by the gesture, but
a couple of bucks here and there will be fine.

102
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,351
Thanks, Peter.

103
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,000
- I'll be on the StairMaster.
- OK, Steve.

104
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,868
- Next time, maybe just say "hello".
- Gar.

105
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,557
Hello.

106
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,473
It's not my birthday till next month,
but terrific.

107
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,676
I'm so sorry. Hi.

108
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,548
I'm Katherine Veatch with Hawthorne Stone.

109
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,555
- Your bank?
- Right. My bank.

110
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,952
- You are very attractive for a banker.
- Thank you. I'm not a banker, I'm a lawyer.

111
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,510
Really? What kind of law
are you involved in, pretty eyes?

112
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,989
Sexual harassment, mostly.

113
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,153
But I also handle real estate and tax law,
which is why I'm here.

114
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,596
- This place is in default?
- No. You're in foreclosure.

115
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,558
You were in default
when we sent you delinquency notices.

116
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,677
- I thought those were just warnings.
- They were warnings.

117
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:27,470
No one warned me. What happens now?
I make my payments out to somebody else?

118
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,109
You have 30 days to pay the balance
of your mortgage, or you lose your gym.

119
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,670
Perfect. What's the damage?
What do I owe you?

120
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,432
$50,000.

121
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,638
Personal cheque gonna be OK? Might have
to wait till the end of the month to cash her?

122
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:47,157
I do have to switch some funds. The charity
I like to work with is gonna take a hit.

123
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,596
Mr La Fleur, I can assure you
this is a very serious situation.

124
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,229
Yeah.
This is extremely serious, Mrs Veatch.

125
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,474
It's Ms. I'll need to review all of your financial
statements and assess any tax liabilities.

126
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,358
Absolutely.
I don't know how you say "Ms" for "Mr",

127
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,113
but if there was a "Ms Mr",
I'm a Ms as well.

128
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,953
You do keep financial records?
Invoices, revenue reports, taxable income.

129
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,157
You kidding? I got a closet full of 'em.
I call 'em keepers.

130
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,429
- Problem is I've never really filed them.
- No kidding.

131
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,830
Just out of curiosity,
who would want to buy this place anyway?

132
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,593
Come on, squeeze it, squeeze it.

133
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,468
Yeah, come on, come on. Get it up.

134
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,870
One more, bitch. One more, bitch.

135
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,633
Yeah. Yeah.

136
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,109
- Now you're my bitch.
- Yeah.

137
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,668
Yeah, baby.

138
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,389
Involuntary spasm.
Look at the show. Enjoy the show.

139
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,239
This a bad time? I could come back.
Looks like some real dude sweat going on.

140
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,518
Add three pounds to the scales in the
women's locker room before you go home.

141
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,230
Refreshment?
I've got protein paste, carb laxative...

142
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,315
- Suffocated kumquat, perhaps?
- I'm trying to cut down on those.

143
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,960
- They're good. They are good.
- Know what you mean.

144
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,031
Walk with me.

145
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,550
Hey, Brianna.
Cellulite seminar tomorrow, 0600.

146
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,590
Nice job, Susie.
You call that a sit-up?

147
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,035
Don't slack, Trevor.
I'm watching you.

148
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,792
There's a good energy in the gym.

149
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,757
Let me guess why you're here, Pete.

150
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,638
Because I bought out
the second mortgage on your gym.

151
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:36,510
You've got 30 days to make $50,000,
or your gym becomes my gym.

152
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,716
I know we've had our differences...

153
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,395
Is that what you call
sleeping with three of my female trainers?

154
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,469
It was one night.

155
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,916
Or the strip-o-gram you sent me
for the Globo Gym one-year anniversary?

156
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,276
- It was meant to be congratulatory.
- It was also a man.

157
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,555
Let's not get hung up on details.

158
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,200
- We're both professionals.
- Really?

159
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,238
Last I heard, my gym makes money.
Yours doesn't.

160
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,995
My gym's worth over $4 million.
Your gym isn't worth four.

161
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:06,278
I have shareholders.
You haven't even got cupholders.

162
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,590
- Why would I want cupholders?
- The point is

163
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,592
Globo Gym is a beacon
of human physical perfection.

164
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,671
A benchmark in the fitness community.

165
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,515
Your "gym" is a skid mark
on the underpants of society.

166
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,071
See, Peter, I wasn't born
expecting the world to do me any favours.

167
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,152
I earned this body
and I built this temple

168
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,789
out of nothing more than
a little can-do attitude and elbow grease.

169
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,599
And a large inheritance
from my father, Earl Goodman.

170
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:38,550
So if I choose to level Average Joe's to build
a parking structure for my members, so be it.

171
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,790
There's nothing you can do about it.

172
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,749
In 30 days, I'll be bulldozing that shit-heap
you call a gym into permanent nothingness.

173
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:50,994
I can only hope that you, and the mongrel
race that comprise your membership,

174
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,640
are inside it when I do.

175
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,430
Show Mr La Fleur out.

176
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,511
Turn it up high, Reggie.

177
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,831
I wanna burn.

178
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,310
So that's the deal. We got 30 days
to raise $50,000, or Average Joe's is history.

179
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,834
I got ten minutes. I'll open it up to some Q&A.

180
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,715
No need to raise your hands,
it's an open forum. OK, Owen, kick us off.

181
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,395
Yes, Peter, - and I'm just spitballing here -

182
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,951
but why don't we pay it off
in Canadian dollars and save some money?

183
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:28,033
Just so you know, if that's a route
you want to follow, it's 50,000 American.

184
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,351
It would be 70,000, roughly, Canadian dollars.

185
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,309
- How are we gonna come up with $120,000?
- Owen, you don't add them together.

186
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,518
Technically, Peter, I'm sorry to say this,
but it's more like $73,313...

187
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,149
It doesn't matter. We can't come up
with $50,000. We're screwed.

188
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,992
Gar.

189
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:51,234
- It's an insurmountable amount of money.
- No, it's not insurmountable. Come on.

190
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,154
We can'tjust sit back
and let Globo Gym take us over.

191
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,198
Average Joe's is too important.

192
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,475
Where do you go
when your wife changes the locks?

193
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,471
- Average Joe's.
- Right.

194
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,269
Dwight, Owen, what will you do
if Joe's goes under? Work at the airport?

195
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,114
- I ain't working at no airport again.
- No. Cos you hated it.

196
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,318
And, Steve, where do you go
to do whatever it is that you do?

197
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,678
- Gar. Joe's be the only place for Steve.
- Gar. You're right.

198
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,392
Do you see? There's no way I can go
back to working out at my high school.

199
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,075
They'd laugh at me there.
Lock me in lockers, make me eat clay.

200
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,913
But not here, not at Joe's.

201
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,755
I need this place.
You guys need this place. Come on.

202
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,953
I got it. I know how we can raise the money.

203
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,554
- How?
- Car wash.

204
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,796
What are the chances?
Same day, right across the street?

205
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,677
The girls beat us fair and square.

206
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:08,591
I am gonna be a gentleman about it and
congratulate every one of them, personally.

207
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:13,117
Guys. Not to be a nay-sayer or anything,
but the only customer we've had

208
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,557
is that weird guy
who keeps paying Justin to wash his truck.

209
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,075
That's it, boy.
Get in there nice and deep, like.

210
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,192
- That's not good.
- Gar. This sucks.

211
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,918
Relax, Justin, it's just a cutout.

212
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,190
At Globo Gym,
we're better than you and we know it.

213
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,033
Sign up now.

214
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,270
Do you smell that fitness? I do.

215
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,715
Rock it and shock it, baby.

216
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,756
You gotta burn it to earn it.

217
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,628
- What's in the envelope?
- Free 30-day memberships to Globo Gym.

218
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,395
- Cool.
- It's ajoke. He sent it to us as an insult.

219
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,314
Maybe we could sell 'em for cash
cos the car wash cost us money.

220
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,868
- We're further away from saving this place?
- Yes.

221
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,474
- We'll never raise enough money.
- This blows.

222
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,471
Guys, I know this is tough to take,

223
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,439
but if an impromptu car wash
doesn't raise us the $50,000 we need,

224
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,556
I guess itjust isn't in the cards.

225
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:30,795
Trust me here. If there was any way in
the world we could raise $50,000 in 30 days,

226
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,110
short of robbing a bank, I'd do it.

227
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,395
We could sell blood and semen.

228
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,232
What? Not mixed together.

229
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,436
Guys, I love the enthusiasm,

230
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,876
I love the energy here,
but we're looking at this the wrong way.

231
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,520
Let's celebrate the good times
that was Joe's.

232
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,876
We gotta start looking at this Irish-wake style.

233
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,514
Let me be the first
to say goodbye to Average Joe's.

234
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,559
We gave it a hell of a run, guys.
Now let's try to have some fun.

235
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,950
I'm gonna put on "The Thong Song",
and we'll tear this place apart.

236
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,270
Wait, wait. Peter. Peter.

237
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,070
We could play dodgeball.

238
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,631
That's very nice, Gordon, but everyone's
tired. Playing a game isn't gonna help.

239
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:18,272
There's a tournament in Las Vegas.
I feel so dumb I didn't think about it before.

240
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,158
I read about
the Las Vegas International Dodgeball Open

241
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,390
every year in <i>Obscure Sports Quarterly.</i>

242
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,994
Of course. That's a totally common thing.

243
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:30,153
The best part is it's open to any team
that wins a regional qualifying match.

244
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,792
- How is dodgeball gonna get us the $50,000?
- They have a cash prize for the winner.

245
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,758
- How much?
- $50,000.

246
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,832
Guys, we are not gonna get $50,000
for playing dodgeball.

247
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,992
- Why not?
- None of us know how to play dodgeball.

248
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,471
I do. We played it in PE last year.
They showed us this film about it.

249
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,757
- Can you get your hands on that film?
- Sure, I guess.

250
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,400
Can we please try to be serious
here for one second?

251
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:00,600
You said anything we could do to raise
the money. This is that anything. This is it.

252
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,956
Come on, show of hands.
Who wants to play dodgeball?

253
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,915
Come on.

254
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,709
Come on, Pete.

255
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,871
You guys had me at blood and semen.
Come here.

256
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,357
You want it, don't you, fat boy?

257
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,317
You want that doughnut.

258
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,073
Go ahead and have a bite.

259
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,948
Just a little bite.
One little bite won't hurt you.

260
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,917
Momma.

261
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,316
- Sir, Katherine Veatch is here to see you.
- Give me 30 seconds and send her in.

262
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,879
Yes, sir.

263
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,711
Thank you.

264
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,758
Hello, Katherine. Good to see you.
I didn't know you were dropping by.

265
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,230
- You asked me to come over.
- Did I?

266
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,153
Are you reading the dictionary?

267
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,275
You caught me. I like to break
a mental sweat too. Grab a chair.

268
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:29,276
So, I trust everything's going swimmingly
with our acquisition of Average Joe's?

269
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,911
So far, yeah. There's a lot to do over there,
so I should probably get back.

270
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,834
- That is a really interesting painting.
- Thank you.

271
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:43,153
Yeah, that's me, taking the bull by the horns.
It's how I handle my business.

272
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,276
It's a metaphor.

273
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,399
- I get it.
- But that actually happened, though.

274
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:54,349
Anyway, we're a pretty tight-knit tribe here,
but there's always room for one more squaw.

275
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,433
So, please, whatever you do,
don't think of me as your boss.

276
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,988
- I don't.
- I don't want to get into a formal thing.

277
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,071
I'm White, you know.

278
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,957
W-h-i-t.

279
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,233
E.

280
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,914
Thanks, Mr Goodman,
but I'm contracted by the bank.

281
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,070
They just assigned me to your account.

282
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:18,917
Right, well. You work for the bank. Bank
works for me so, ipso fact, I'm your boss.

283
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,030
Point is, I would love to see your pretty
little bone structure around here some more.

284
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,190
There's no reason we need to be shackled

285
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,319
by the strictures of
the employee-employer relationship.

286
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,868
Unless you're into that sort of thing.

287
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,633
In which case,
I got some shackles in the back.

288
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,269
I'm just kidding.
But seriously, I've got 'em.

289
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,999
I'm just doing my job, Mr Goodman.

290
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:48,200
In fact, I actually prefer it over there.

291
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,989
Really? You like it with those freaks
over there in Loser-Town?

292
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,197
They're not freaks.
They're people, just like you and me.

293
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,636
People?

294
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,188
"People, just like you and me."
Oh, man.

295
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,955
That is what I love about you, Kate.
You've got a "personality".

296
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:12,837
That is rich. A real sauciness
that I find extremely attractive.

297
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,990
We should mate.

298
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,798
- What?
- Date.

299
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,838
We should date some time. Socially.
Go out and kick it.

300
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,517
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

301
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,831
I just threw up in my mouth a little bit.

302
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,157
In some cultures, they only eat vomit.

303
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,909
I never been there,
but I read about it in a book.

304
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,595
I'm sorry, Mr Goodman.
I don't date clients.

305
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,918
I get it.

306
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,436
Don't crap where you eat. I understand.

307
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,229
Me'Shell.
Please escort Ms Veatch out.

308
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:56,833
And, Katherine, make sure
my acquisition of that gym goes smoothly.

309
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,071
They're up to something over there.
I can smell it.

310
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,677
Ûber-American Instructional films,
teaching America's youth since 1938.

311
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,957
Hey, there, Timmy.

312
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,635
Holy mackerel, mister.
You scared the jeepers out of me.

313
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,429
How'd you like to take a break
from that fine lead-based paint,

314
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,873
and learn about dodgeball?

315
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,791
Boy, would I.

316
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,757
- Where am I, mister?
- You're in a Chinese opium den, Timmy.

317
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,196
This is where dodgeball
was invented in the 15th century,

318
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,510
by opium-addicted Chinamen.

319
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,956
Back then, the Chinamen threw
severed human heads at each another

320
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,271
instead of the ADAA-approved balls
we use today.

321
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,795
ADAA?

322
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,429
That's the American Dodgeball
Association of America.

323
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:03,878
Dodgeball is played with six players
on each team, and six rubber balls.

324
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,032
The object of the game
is to eliminate the opposing players.

325
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,432
Once all the players on one team are
eliminated, the opposing team wins.

326
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,433
Wow. I can't wait
to get the fellas together and play.

327
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,118
Hang on a second there, sport.

328
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,192
- Patches O'Houlihan.
- That's right, Timmy.

329
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:29,071
Patches O'Houlihan. Seven-time ADAA
All-Star is here to take you the rest of the way.

330
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,675
- Jeepers. Really?
- You betcha, champ.

331
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,993
If you catch a ball that's thrown at you
before it hits the ground,

332
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,311
the player who threw that ball is out,
not you.

333
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,030
Plus, another player from your team
gets to come back into the game.

334
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,510
- It's a two-player swing.
- Thanks, Patches.

335
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,353
I can't wait to start my own team at school.

336
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,476
Attaboy, Tiger.

337
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:58,998
But remember, dodgeball is a sport
of violence, exclusion and degradation.

338
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,072
So, when you're picking players in gym class,

339
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:06,153
remember to pick the bigger,
stronger kids for your team.

340
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,633
That way, you can all gang up
on the weaker ones, like Winston here.

341
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,238
Nice one, son.
You'll be an all-star yet.

342
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,756
Just remember the five Ds of dodgeball.

343
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,513
Dodge, duck, dip, dive and

344
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,158
dodge.

345
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,152
Till next time.
This is Patches O'Houlihan,

346
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,791
saying, "Take care of your balls
and they'll take care of you."

347
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,079
OK, guys. Any questions? Great.

348
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:43,836
I signed us up for the sub-regional qualifier
tomorrow at the Waldorf rec centre.

349
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,797
But we haven't even practised yet.

350
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,555
We have to qualify for the Vegas Open.
Tomorrow's regional's our last chance.

351
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:54,873
Everyone, just relax. I've always found
the best way to learn a sport is by playing it.

352
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,633
If anyone needs me,
I'll be in my office doing Mad Libs.

353
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,870
Thanks, Peter. Appreciate that a lot.

354
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,791
OK, I think everybody knows...

355
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,079
- Don't you have an office of your own?
- Yes, I do have an office.

356
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,913
A very nice office
with a view and air-conditioning.

357
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,197
- Rub it in.
- What I don't have in my office is a closet

358
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:20,035
of 30 years of financial transactions,
devoid of any filing system known to man.

359
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,908
Hard to believe I only got a semester
ofjunior college under my belt.

360
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,790
Do you realise you haven't collected
any membership fees in 13 months?

361
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,714
I'm curious. Is it strictly apathy,
or do you really not have a goal in life?

362
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,395
I found that if you have a goal,
you might not reach it.

363
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,995
But if you don't have one,
then you are never disappointed.

364
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,392
I gotta tell you, it feels phenomenal.

365
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,631
I guess that makes sense, in a really sad way.

366
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,359
Sad? You wanna know what's sad?

367
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,193
Six grown men playing dodgeball.

368
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,593
Since I'm here, I'm gonna go ahead
and do some abs, go shock it up.

369
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,229
I like to work out all the time
for this kind of sporting event.

370
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,039
Gotta be limber and loose.
That's the only way to play.

371
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:08,557
Hey, you guys take vitamins?
I take vitamins all the time...

372
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,155
Dodgeball, eh?

373
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:18,075
If Peter La Fleur thinks a few
red rubber balls can save his sorry gym,

374
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,913
he's in for quite a surprise.

375
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,678
- Sorry I'm late, guys.
- Hey, Pete.

376
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,912
- Bad morning, boss?
- They usually follow good nights, Dwight.

377
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,070
- Hey, Gord, your family's here.
- Where?

378
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,310
- Right over there.
- Great.

379
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,676
She knows I don't like it
when she watches me. I get all nervous.

380
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,513
- Kids take after you.
- Yeah. She's their stepmother.

381
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,558
I remarried three years ago.
An Internet mail-order thing.

382
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:53,679
- How's that working out for you?
- Really great. Really great.

383
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,159
Hey, honey.

384
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,758
L for love. Good times.

385
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,831
L for love? That doesn't mean love...

386
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,388
People have different translations for things.

387
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,712
That's a special bond that you have with
your mail-order wife. I think that's nice.

388
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,950
- How many teams are in this qualifier?
- Two.

389
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,349
If we beat this team,
we're in the Vegas Open?

390
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,237
- Yeah.
- That seems pretty simple.

391
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:20,110
- Who's the other team?
- I have it right here. Just a sec.

392
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:24,671
- Troop 417.
- Christ. We're playing Boy Scouts?

393
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,474
Not quite.

394
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,273
Bollocks.

395
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,670
Troop 417, ready.

396
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,398
Average Joe's, ready.

397
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,712
Set. Dodgeball.

398
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,389
I'm gonna send you to hell.

399
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:32,748
- I'm really sorry. Are you all right?
- Why would you hit a girl? Why?

400
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,796
I am so sorry. Are you OK?

401
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,355
Winner - Troop 417.

402
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,431
In your face.

403
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,718
You're adopted.
Your parents don't even love you.

404
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,791
And now, without further ado,
it gives me great pleasure to award...

405
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,512
I'm sorry.
We have a bit of a problem here.

406
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,357
Unfortunately for Troop 417,

407
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,274
during the ADAA-required
random drug screening,

408
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:12,559
one of your player's urine tested positive
for three separate types of anabolic steroids,

409
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,394
and a low-grade beaver tranquilliser.

410
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,439
I'm afraid, by rule,
your team must be disqualified.

411
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,275
Goddamn you, Bernice.

412
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,270
By the power vested in me,
I declare the winner of this year's

413
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,593
Dodgeball Regional Qualifying Tournament
and Grammar Jamboree to be

414
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,432
Average Joe's Gym.

415
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,878
You lied.

416
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:50,435
All I'm saying to you, Kate, is that you can
admit the real reason why you showed up.

417
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:54,832
I was in the neighbourhood and
I thought you could use a cheering section.

418
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:58,469
Kate, if you wannajoin the team,
all you have to do is ask.

419
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,279
Thank you, Peter. I don't.

420
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,833
It is obvious that you dig me.

421
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,831
- You're hooked on La Fleur.
- God.

422
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:11,710
I've been through this many times. I'm sorry.
You can't stay away from me. I'm so stupid.

423
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:17,670
I'll admit that, in spite of yourself, you have
brief moments where you're not completely...

424
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,192
What? I'm not completely what?

425
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,919
Pathetic.

426
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,557
Hey, White. I didn't think
that Nazi camp got out until eight.

427
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,997
- Did you decide to skip arts and crafts?
- Yes, I did.

428
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:36,959
Hello, Kate.
I wasn't aware I was paying you to socialise.

429
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:43,559
- You're not. I'm off the clock.
- Isn't it "convenient" for you, and the clock?

430
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:47,599
I dropped by to congratulate you
on your victory by disqualification

431
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,514
and introduce you to the team that
will win the Las Vegas Dodgeball Open.

432
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,272
My team.

433
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,869
Allow me the pleasure of introducing you to

434
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,951
Blade.

435
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,831
Laser.

436
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,995
Blazer.

437
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:08,470
I've believe you've met
my fitness <i>consigliere,</i> Me'Shell.

438
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:12,951
- We met.
- And I almost forgot our last player.

439
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:17,795
Meet Fran Stalinofskivitchdavitovichski.

440
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:31,519
In her home country of Romanovia,
dodgeball is the national sport.

441
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,878
Her nuclear power plant's team won
the championship five years running,

442
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:40,954
which makes her the deadliest woman
on earth with a dodgeball.

443
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,758
Ball me, Blazer.

444
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,469
Show them, Fran.

445
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,319
That's just her change-up.

446
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,391
End of demo.

447
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,278
We are the Globo Gym Purple Cobras

448
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,955
and we will, we will rock you.

449
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,913
I think that guy might really be dead.

450
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:13,638
Wait a minute. How can you be
entered in the Las Vegas Open?

451
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,915
You didn't win a regional qualifying match.

452
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,197
Oh, my God. We never even won
a regional qualifying match.

453
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,271
Yeah. Now I remember.

454
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,909
The dodgeball chancellor's
an extremely personal friend of mine.

455
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,151
I helped him shed some unwanted poundage
before beach season.

456
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,834
So close your rule book
on that one, Poindextor.

457
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:35,311
White, we didn't come here to "rumble".
We came here to celebrate as a team.

458
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,437
There's plenty of bar here
for you and the Globo-nauts.

459
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,238
Team?

460
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,154
What team?
Your best player thinks he's a pirate.

461
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,790
First of all, he is way more
of a pirate than you will ever be.

462
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:56,000
Secondly, we don't know who our best player
is yet. We've only had one game.

463
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,676
- It could be any one of us at this point.
- Go ahead, make yourjokes, Mr

464
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,751
Jokey... Joke-maker.

465
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,638
But let me hit you with
some knowledge. Quit now.

466
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:10,794
Save yourself the embarrassment of losing
with these losers in Las Vegas, La Fleur.

467
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,952
Alliteration aside,
I'll take my chances in the tournament.

468
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:18,431
- Yeah, you will take your chances.
- I know. I just said that.

469
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,557
- I know you did.
- I'm not sure where you're going with this.

470
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,950
- I'm not sure where <i>you're</i> going with this.
- That's what I said.

471
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:29,192
- That's what I'm saying to you.
- All right.

472
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,759
Touché.

473
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,238
We're gonna split,
but we'll see you at the tournament.

474
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:41,110
And, La Fleur, best bring your bib
cos it's gonna get messy.

475
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,670
Are you all right? You OK?

476
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,870
Let's bounce. Cobras.

477
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:00,956
OK, guys, let's just get ourselves cleaned up
and head on home, all right?

478
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,468
Hey, you.

479
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:13,156
That was the worst damn display
of dodgeball I've seen in 40 years.

480
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,596
You want a dodgeball victory,
you've gotta grab it by its haunches

481
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,956
and hump it into submission.
That's the only way.

482
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,271
OK, crazy guy. I'm gonna go home now.

483
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,318
I ain't crazy and I ain't a guy.

484
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,273
The name's Patches O'Houlihan.

485
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,920
I'm your new coach.

486
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,833
Patches O'Houlihan?
The guy from the dodgeball film?

487
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,639
- Yeah. He said he wants to coach us.
- You said yes?

488
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,679
I figured the steady hand of a seasoned
dodgeball coach could only benefit us.

489
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,718
A'iight.
But he's not weird or anything, is he?

490
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,598
No. No, he's totally normal.

491
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,476
I love the smell of queef in the morning.

492
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,551
I mean normal for us.

493
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,871
Line up, ladies.

494
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,235
- What does he mean, line up?
- Now.

495
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,869
If you're gonna learn to be
true dodgeballers,

496
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,635
then you've got to learn
the five Ds of dodgeball:

497
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,678
dodge, duck, dip, dive and dodge.

498
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:28,551
If you master the five Ds,
no amount of balls on earth can hit you.

499
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,837
- Queer bait, go ahead.
- Me, or...

500
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:37,630
Yeah, shouldn't we learn by dodging balls
that are thrown at us, or...

501
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,951
That's what this sack of wrenches is for.

502
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,600
If you can dodge a wrench,
you can dodge a ball.

503
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,671
What?

504
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,792
Any other questions?

505
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,996
My God.

506
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:08,995
Yeah. Patches, are you sure
that this is completely necessary?

507
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,435
Necessary?

508
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,638
- Is it necessary for me to drink my urine?
- Probably not.

509
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:20,555
No. But I do it anyway
because it's sterile and I like the taste.

510
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,039
OK.

511
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:27,399
If you're leading this squad, La Fleur, you've
got to learn to do the dance in the dark.

512
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,037
Here, put that on.

513
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,395
All right, ladies, buckle up.

514
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,039
It's showtime.

515
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,109
Dodge, duck, dip. Dive.

516
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,278
Dodge.

517
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,112
Dive.

518
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,317
Dip. Dive. Dodge.

519
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,516
I've got three weeks to whip you
suck-ass failure junkies into shape.

520
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:56,070
Come on. I get better runs in my shorts.

521
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:01,595
Catch a ball, one of their guys goes out.
One of our guys comes back in.

522
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,797
That's the way you hurt 'em.
That's the way you win.

523
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,237
Let's go. A little hustle here.

524
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,792
That's really good, Peter.

525
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:25,478
Come on. Only 19 miles to go.

526
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,274
Attaboy.

527
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,996
Next man.

528
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:37,117
Good luck to you, Gordon.
Remember it's 90% mental.

529
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,189
Okey-dokey.

530
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:42,353
If you can dodge traffic,
you can dodge a ball.

531
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,796
You got it, Gord.

532
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,437
- I'm fine. I'm OK.
- OK, there.

533
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,036
- Man.
- Wake up, Smithy.

534
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,878
Hell, son. You're about as useful
as a cock-flavoured lollipop.

535
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,869
Quick feet, fast hands.

536
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,837
Catch it and throw.

537
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:24,156
Pick up the pace. What a bunch of females.

538
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,478
Jesus. Gimme that.

539
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,717
You couldn't hit water
if you fell out of a boat.

540
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,633
Where's your killer instinct?
You gotta get angry.

541
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:41,269
You gotta get mean.
That's the only way you can play.

542
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,554
I guess I'm not really an angry person.

543
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,240
Are you angry now?

544
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:56,075
- Breathe it out.
- Come on, let's get going here.

545
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,157
Little help?

546
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,673
What? Eight years of softball.

547
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:20,389
- Man, she gotta be a lesbian.
- She is not a lesbian.

548
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,074
All I know is that dyke can play.

549
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,270
Come on, come on.

550
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,828
- Please.
- We need you. You're really good.

551
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,831
Owen'll be team manager if you play.

552
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,478
- I will?
- Shut up.

553
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,393
Look, I find White Goodman creepy,
just like you do...

554
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,789
All the more reason for you to join us.

555
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,031
Come on, Kate.
Time to put your mouth where our balls are.

556
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:55,238
Sorry, I can't. I'm under contract.
It'd be a conflict of interest.

557
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,836
Suit yourself.

558
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,515
All right, you heard Billie-Jean King.
No crying in the breast milk.

559
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,795
We got plenty of work to do. Let's go.

560
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,995
We punch the pizza dough down,
and it's time to sauce it up.

561
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,071
Boy, is my mouth watering.

562
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:16,470
You want to put a big dollop
of that tangy red on the dough,

563
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,393
then use the cheese to shove it to the edge.

564
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,436
Sir, I need you to take a look at...

565
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,397
No. What...

566
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:28,031
What...
What have I said about knocking?

567
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,390
- Always knock.
- Sorry, sir.

568
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:35,713
What is so important that you need to
interrupt me in my private reflection period?

569
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,231
These.

570
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:46,557
- They're getting better.
- Yes. I can see that, Me'Shell.

571
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,918
I'm through playing games. It's time
to end this square dance once and for all.

572
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,070
What about the girl? She can throw.

573
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:57,039
I'll simply have to woo Kate
a bit sooner than nature intended.

574
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,873
But rest assured, Me'Shell.

575
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:05,273
There's no resisting when
White Goodman puts on his shiny shoes.

576
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,436
- Who is it?
- It's White.

577
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,793
- Surprise.
- White.

578
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,998
What... What are you doing here?

579
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,310
How do you know where I live?

580
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,595
It's called the Freedom of Information Act.

581
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,229
The hippies finally got something right.
Just kiddin'. Not really.

582
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:48,995
Hey. I got some great news. Sit down.

583
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,751
- What is it?
- You're fired.

584
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,478
- I'm what?
- You're fired.

585
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:59,235
I told the bank that you were stealing
and drinking on the job. They bought it.

586
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:02,471
They signed some other
pencil pusher to my account.

587
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,710
Why would you do that?

588
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,834
I'm here to begin my courtship of you, Kate.

589
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,832
- You fired me so I'd date you?
- Yuh-huh.

590
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,673
You are a crazy little man.

591
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,354
I know you've been hiding
some feelings for me.

592
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,476
Yeah. Nausea.

593
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,836
If you don't leave in two seconds,
you'll know how that feels.

594
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,279
You like the freaky stuff, huh?
That's cool.

595
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,957
I can be naughty, too.

596
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,949
Real, freakin' naughty.

597
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,396
- You a naughty freak?
- Need help leaving?

598
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,072
This doesn't concern you, La Fleur.

599
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,391
Not nearly as much as your hair does.
That's for sure.

600
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:47,109
But I believe she asked you to leave.

601
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,516
I get it. You caught the scent
of a lesser stag in your nostrils.

602
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:57,991
Pity. I'll let you have
your little moment, La Fleur,

603
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:05,156
cos after this tournament, your gym,
your life and your gal are gonna be mine.

604
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,310
All mine.

605
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,871
To be continued...

606
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,633
You don't get to touch me, ever.

607
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,075
OK, Romeo. Let me help you up.

608
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:18,630
Get off me.
Don't you touch me.

609
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,552
It is over between us, Kate.

610
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,552
Nobody makes me bleed my own blood.
Nobody.

611
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:43,511
- At least that wasn't weird.
- Yeah.

612
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,478
- Do I smell cookies?
- Hey.

613
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,189
Dear Barbara.

614
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,037
I like unicorns.

615
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,710
I know you said no to joining the team,

616
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:07,554
but I'd like you to reconsider
as a personal favour to me.

617
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,278
- Peter...
- Before you answer,

618
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,828
you should know you'd have
your own changing room.

619
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,036
- Really?
- Sort of.

620
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,395
And there's also this.

621
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,310
- OK, what's this?
- I overdid.

622
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:26,195
Look at you. Two expired movie passes

623
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:30,637
and a coupon for one free back rub
from Peter La Fleur.

624
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:35,236
- Play your cards right, could be a full body.
- Will you just stop, please?

625
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:39,199
I don't want your perk package.
I don't want your back rub.

626
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,829
I just want to see White Goodman's face
when we win that tournament.

627
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,195
- You're in?
- I'm in.

628
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:53,990
Las Vegas. A city built of hot sand,
broken dreams and $5 lobster.

629
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:57,675
A city where you can get a happy ending,
if you pay a little extra.

630
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,911
A city home to a sporting event
greater than the World Cup,

631
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,312
World Series and World War II combined.

632
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:09,518
Live from Las Vegas, it's the Las Vegas
International Dodgeball Open

633
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,319
here on ESPN8 - the "Ocho" -

634
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,996
bringing you the finest in seldom-seen sports
from around the globe since 1999.

635
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:20,311
If it's almost a sport, we've got it here.

636
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:25,997
Hello, everybody, and welcome to this year's
Las Vegas International Dodgeball Open

637
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,231
brought to you exclusively
here on ESPN8 - the "Ocho".

638
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:32,915
We're coming to you live from
the Las Vegas University Learning Annex.

639
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,797
My name is Cotton McKnight

640
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,589
and with me, as always,
is my partner in crime, Pepper Brooks.

641
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,477
Yeah. Cotton, hey.

642
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:45,793
Everybody, 32 teams in play, that means
four wins is gonna get you in the final match,

643
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:49,190
the fifth win getting you
the 50K that everyone's chasing.

644
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,269
Cotton.

645
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:55,480
There's an electricity in the air,
a palpable hue of anticipation.

646
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:58,916
Immortality - five simple victories away.

647
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,676
They've come from all over - Kathmandu
to Timbuktu, and all points in-between -

648
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:08,038
to compete in the one
true human test - dodgeball.

649
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,354
A reminder.
All players must be vaccinated

650
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,592
for cholera, syphilis and shingles
before play begins.

651
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:19,912
Again, dyslexic players
will not be allowed on the court.

652
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,278
Team Blitzkrieg to the tournament floor
for a first-round match.

653
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:27,591
Only ADAA balls will be used.

654
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,355
Personal balls of any kind
are strictly prohibited.

655
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,829
- Hey.
- Hey. What's in the box?

656
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:38,311
Guys, I figured a real dodgeball team
needs real dodgeball uniforms.

657
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,109
So I threw out those old ratty ones
and designed these myself.

658
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:46,398
All right. Now we got our thing going on,
maybe we'll start smacking each other.

659
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,471
I hope everything fits.

660
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,954
- Wait.
- Nice.

661
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:57,397
This isn't right.
This isn't what I ordered.

662
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:04,749
- What's this?
- What the hell is that? This is screwed up.

663
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,513
- What are we supposed to do now?
- Don't worry.

664
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,716
- We'll play in what we've got on.
- We can't.

665
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,473
ADAA rules require we wear
matching uniforms.

666
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:17,599
I don't think they require ass-less chaps, OK?

667
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:22,674
Everybody, calm down. We've got plenty
of time to find other uniforms before we play.

668
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:26,116
Ladies, we gotta get on the court
or we're gonna forfeit the game.

669
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,909
Come on, let's go.
Let's see some movement. Chop-chop.

670
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,956
I don't see any movement. Let's go.

671
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,833
How about those dodgeball dancers, folks?

672
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:48,674
- That is some good, clean, family fun, Cot.
- Right you are.

673
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:51,115
Here comes Germany's Team Blitzkrieg.

674
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,476
The reigning European champ
hopes to extend their empire here.

675
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,551
Appeasement be damned.

676
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,837
Here comes
the relatively unknown challengers,

677
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,993
a regional qualifying team,
Average Joe's Gymnasium.

678
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,550
My sweet Jesus.

679
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,436
That's rad.

680
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:21,239
Hey, asshole, you guys suck.

681
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,114
Thank you. Nice to be in Vegas.

682
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,794
Hi. We're all here and

683
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,711
we are ready to play.

684
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,874
- OK.
- OK.

685
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:39,679
We get our first glimpse of the Average Joe's
squad, sporting unwieldy uniforms.

686
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,479
I feel like I'm watching a Cher video.

687
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,471
Average Joe's, ready.

688
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,437
Blitzkrieg, ready.

689
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:47,873
Dodgeball.

690
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:52,590
And we're under way. Average Joe's
versus the heavily favoured German team.

691
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:56,355
Of course, S&M gear first made
popular by the lyric poet, Sappho,

692
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,352
- from the island of Lesbos.
- Clean hit. You're out.

693
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:04,036
Leather and latex belong in the bedroom,
not on the dodgeball court.

694
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:09,353
Where's that training?
Dodge, duck, dip, dive, dodge.

695
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:14,197
Captain Peter La Fleur gets eliminated
and coach O'Houlihan is not happy.

696
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,760
This Average Joe's team
doesn't look up to snuff.

697
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,270
Midline infraction.
You went over the line, you're out.

698
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:30,715
The Average Joe's catches a break there.

699
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,236
The Germans still dominating
this Maginot Line-like defence.

700
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,788
Good toss by the submissive out there.

701
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,873
Just two players left for Joe...
Check that. Make it one.

702
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,758
Looks like Average Joe's
might be heading home early.

703
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:47,954
It's all up to the only player
without a Y-chromosome, Kate Veatch.

704
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:51,071
What a throw.

705
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,196
Hold your phone, she's got a cannon.

706
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,872
Yes.

707
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:59,033
- Come on, Kate.
- You're the only man out there. Give it to 'em.

708
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:04,194
Germans have a two-one advantage.
Great catch. La Fleur's back in the game.

709
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:08,671
How about that? A two-on-one switcheroo.
Now Joe's has the upper hand.

710
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,637
- Great deflection.
- Take it to him.

711
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:15,271
- He's ball-less now.
- He doesn't have any balls, Cotton.

712
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:18,158
Winner. Average Joe's.

713
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,909
My sweet dick, it's magic.

714
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,228
Hey, all right.

715
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:28,758
My. The Germans losing in the first round
and Average Joe's wins in a shocking upset.

716
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,479
I feel shocked.

717
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,796
Losers.

718
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:55,478
You must be Daddy.

719
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:59,992
Average Joe's has shocked the dodgeball
pundits and made it to tomorrow's round

720
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,629
where we'll separate the wheat from the chaff,
the men from the boys,

721
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:06,757
and the awkwardly feminine
from the possibly Canadian.

722
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,957
Don't go anywhere, folks.
It's just getting exciting.

723
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:17,670
- What the hell.
- That guy's a dickhead.

724
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:25,548
You wanted to see me, Patches?

725
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:30,309
You did good out there, real good.
You're a natural leader, La Fleur.

726
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,392
Those men and that muff-diver believe in you.

727
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,869
Kate's not a muff-diver.

728
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,591
Hey. That's for you.

729
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:44,037
- I can't accept this.
- You're a hell of a player, Peter.

730
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:46,429
You earned it.

731
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:51,230
I've got some hookers in my room.
What do you say we go celebrate? My treat.

732
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:54,437
No, thanks, I'll just stick
with the scarf, but thank you.

733
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,511
Suit yourself, queer.

734
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,112
- Sorry.
- Justin?

735
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,794
Amber.
Jeez Louise, what are you doing here?

736
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:15,829
- The National Cheerleading Championships.
- Oh, yeah, the NCCs. That's so awesome.

737
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:19,674
- We're in the finals tomorrow. And you?
- I'm in the dodgeball tournament.

738
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:24,311
These are my team-mates,
Dwight, Ms Veatch and Gordon.

739
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,595
This is Amber.

740
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,750
Come on, I wanna ride the roller coaster.

741
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:33,550
- Hey, Derek. Sweet 'do, man.
- Get bent, helmet. Let's go, Amber.

742
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:39,033
- It was nice to see you. Good luck tomorrow.
- And also you. You look healthy... good.

743
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:41,359
What?

744
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:44,318
Don't worry about that guy, Justin.
He's a total jerk.

745
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,710
He'll probably fall off the roller coaster
and break every bone.

746
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:50,360
- Nice, Dwight.
- I'm just saying, it happens.

747
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,908
My cousin Ray-Ray. Boop. Dead.

748
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,149
Thanks, man.

749
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:01,398
Let's huddle up here.
We've got some work to do.

750
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:03,596
We got lucky in the first round.

751
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:07,150
We caught those dirty Krauts napping,
but that won't happen again,

752
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:11,233
so blow out the horse hockey
and remember what I taught you.

753
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:17,509
Blockers in the centre, funnelling, aim low
and will someone catch a goddamned ball?

754
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:22,116
It's like watching a bunch of retards
trying to fuck a doorknob out there.

755
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:25,988
Get it together.
Let's play some dodgeball.

756
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:27,911
Hands in.

757
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,991
One, two, three, Joe's.

758
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,750
- Average Joe's ready?
- Yes.

759
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:35,910
Lumberjacks, ready?

760
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:36,989
Dodgeball.

761
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:40,516
Average Joe's has a tough job,
facing the Lumberjacks.

762
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:44,036
These woodsmen probably haven't
even smelt a woman in eight months.

763
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,839
They must masturbate a lot, Cotton.

764
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:49,514
- Clean hit. You're out.
- In the deer gut.

765
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:52,478
- Average Joe's looking tough.
- Yes.

766
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:59,880
There's a souvenir for a lucky fan.

767
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:06,670
Timber. Peter La Fleur nails him.
That's all she wrote, folks.

768
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:10,833
Average Joe's does some clear-cutting of
their own and moves onto the quarterfinal.

769
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,599
Globo Gym hoping to drop an A-bomb
on the Kamikazes.

770
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:19,116
I don't know how they can play
in diapers, Cotton. I never could.

771
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,519
Peekaboo.

772
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:23,672
White Goodman, employing
his patented peekaboo-style attack,

773
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:27,070
tells Suzuki Toyota Oshinawa this is my dojo.

774
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:31,712
Is he gonna feel it tomorrow?
Right in his beak.

775
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:36,555
A relentless Globo Gym attack led by
their Lilliputian leader, White Goodman.

776
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:39,598
It's gotta be the hair. It's beautiful.

777
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:43,958
Feathered and lethal.
You just don't see it nowadays.

778
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:50,877
Globo Gym says, <i>"Domo arigato,</i> Mr Roboto",
and breezes into the semifinals.

779
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:56,555
Skillz That Killz, ready?
Average Joe's, ready? Dodgeball.

780
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,916
Average Joe's planning
to playa hate Skillz That Killz,

781
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,309
the inner-city champs for five years straight.

782
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:06,916
Skillz might be looking past Average Joe's,
doing more dancing than dodgeballing.

783
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,436
They better check themselves
before they wreck themselves.

784
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:15,514
Right you are, partner.
Great catch. La Fleur wheels and fires.

785
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,914
Winner. Average Joe's.

786
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,710
And Average Joe's, not blinded by the
bling-bling, advances to the semifinal.

787
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:30,557
Globo Gym's making mincemeat
of the Las Vegas Police Department.

788
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,312
That's gotta hurt.

789
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:36,191
B-b-b-bull's-eye.

790
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:38,510
Winner. Globo Gym.

791
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:43,469
Sportsmanship be darned.
Globo Gym hands the Las Vegas Police a 187,

792
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:46,028
and they're going to the finals.

793
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:52,558
The Poughkeepsie State Flying Cougars
are all over Average Joe's today.

794
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:57,794
Itjust doesn't look good for 'em. The winner
of this match faces Globo Gym in the finals.

795
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:59,871
Right in the testicles.

796
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:02,394
Ouch-Town. Population: you, bro.

797
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:05,517
Average Joe's down to their final two players.

798
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,910
La Fleur can't hold on.
He's gotta sit down.

799
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,878
- Time out. Gordy.
- Time out. Time out.

800
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,833
Time. Time is out.

801
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:17,754
It looks like the clock is about to
strike midnight on this Cinderella story,

802
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:20,434
turning Average Joe's
into the proverbial pumpkin.

803
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,909
I sure do like pumpkins, Cotton.

804
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:27,670
You won't hit 'em. They're too good,
and you suck somethin' awful.

805
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:31,275
- Yes, sir. I do.
- Our only shot is for you to get angry.

806
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:34,909
- Roger that. OK.
- All right. Hands in.

807
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,309
- One, two, three.
- Joe's.

808
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:41,078
You gotta get angry. Get angry now.

809
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:45,711
Gordon Pibb, alone, facing five Cougars.
It's all over but the crying.

810
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:49,190
Sayonara, <i>auf Wiedersehen</i> and goodbye.

811
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:05,230
- Dodgeball.
- Let the dodgeball slaughter begin.

812
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,151
Good deflection there.

813
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,390
Hang on. And another one.

814
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,948
Three balls at once. Who knew?

815
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:14,874
Four on one.
Pibb won't go down without a fight.

816
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,269
That's it.

817
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:20,352
- You're kidding me.
- He's callin' 'em out.

818
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,151
Now it's two on one. Who'd have thunk it?

819
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:27,950
- Go, you crazy son of a bitch. Go.
- He's on the warpath.

820
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,514
Incredible. It's one on one.

821
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:36,275
- I can't believe it.
- It's just not believable, Cotton.

822
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:45,109
Winner.

823
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:48,512
Average Joe's wins.

824
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:53,469
They are going to the finals
to play Globo Gym for $50,000.

825
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:57,269
- That'll buy one heck of a pumpkin.
- Right you are, Pep.

826
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:59,749
I never would have dreamed it possible.

827
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:04,277
But with seven-time ADAA All-Star
Patches O'Houlihan at the helm,

828
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:07,079
I guess it must be the luck of the Irish.

829
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:14,873
Tomorrow we're gonna pecker-slap
those Globo Gym bastards.

830
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:15,710
Yeah.

831
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:20,157
- You really think we can beat Globo Gym?
- As long as we got Patches, we got a shot.

832
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,074
My God.

833
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:32,794
Well, it's probably the way
he would have wanted to go.

834
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:36,156
- What?
- What are we gonna do without Patches?

835
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,310
We're gonna get our taints handed to us.

836
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,358
- What's a taint?
- I dunno. Sounds bad.

837
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:45,671
Maybe you should
go say something to the guys.

838
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:46,875
Yeah.

839
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:53,308
They don't make a "sorry your coach just got
crushed by two tons of irony" Hallmark card.

840
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:57,268
I'll be right back.

841
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:08,999
What?

842
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:14,074
We're opening a new Globo Gym in Mexico
City. I've been boning up on my Spanish.

843
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:19,470
Me'Shell was having some digestive
problems. I hope you don't mind.

844
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,755
Will you shut that?

845
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:24,400
For all of us, baby.

846
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:32,557
So that's the deal. I give you $100,000,
you sign over the deed to your gym.

847
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,312
Period.

848
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,470
End o'story.

849
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:41,680
You really think you can come here and buy
me out, you're a lot dumber than I thought.

850
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:47,153
Oh, I don't think I'm a lot dumber than you
thought I'd think that I thought I was once.

851
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:50,312
Look, Peter, I know what it's like.

852
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:54,837
Really. For all our blustery back-and-forth,
we're really pretty much the same guy.

853
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:58,469
We're both leaders. And I like
what you've done with the gym over there.

854
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:03,270
I love the whole "I'm not OK, you're not OK,
but that's OK" thing you got going.

855
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:06,557
"You can be fat as long as
you're happy inside." It works.

856
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:09,950
And they love you. Whoo, do they love you.

857
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:11,951
You're their Fonzie, Pete.

858
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:14,235
"Hey." Right?

859
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:21,598
But do you really think it's fair for them
to put all that pressure on you? All the time?

860
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:25,717
Looking to you to solve their every problem?

861
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,358
I mean, come on.

862
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:31,433
I know you. You know you.

863
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:34,432
And I know you know that I know you.

864
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:36,909
You're heading for a fall, Pete.

865
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,356
Sooner or later, Average Joe's is gonna close.

866
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:44,433
And when it does, they're gonna blame you.

867
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:49,794
I don't know if you've ever seen $100,000,
except maybe in the movies.

868
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:53,634
But I assure you,
something gets lost in the translation.

869
00:59:56,520 --> 01:00:00,479
Money. $100,000. Dodgeball game.

870
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:03,952
Take the money.

871
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:09,316
Invest it in something.
Give it to charity, I don't care.

872
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,990
Just sign the contract.

873
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:26,078
Come on, guys. We got Peter.

874
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:30,153
And they got guys named Laser and Blazer
and Taser, and all kinds of asers.

875
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:33,630
Gar. Steve's gotta go drain the sea monster.

876
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:36,790
Here. Justin, your virgin daiquiri.

877
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,348
- Thanks, Ms Veatch.
- Nothing for me.

878
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:43,513
- Dwight says we'll get killed out there, Peter.
- Let's not talk about tomorrow.

879
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:46,956
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know. It's a little complicated.

880
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:50,077
- But what do you think we should do?
- Yeah. Come on, tell us.

881
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:51,354
What's the plan?

882
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:54,557
What do you guys want from me?
I don't have a plan for you.

883
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:58,679
We're gonna play Globo Gym tomorrow
and we're probably gonna lose.

884
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:04,198
It's the truth. The sooner you guys get that
through your head, the easier this will all be.

885
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:08,028
Jesus Christ.

886
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,550
He didn't mean that.

887
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:14,713
- Is he being serious?
- He's probably just stressed out.

888
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:17,553
I've never seen him like that.

889
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:23,235
Gar, matey, where are you headed? Peter...

890
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:25,788
You are not a pirate.

891
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:37,631
OK, guys. Let's get out of here
and get some rest for tomorrow, right?

892
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,757
Dwight...

893
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:51,675
I'm gonna catch up with you guys later.
I'm gonna have a bathroom... go to the drink...

894
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,478
in the bathroom.

895
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:56,074
Whatever you do, wash your hands.

896
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:08,600
Excuse me, miss. I was wondering if...

897
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:11,114
You are the one who stares at me.

898
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,475
Why is this?

899
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:17,997
Because I think you're
the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

900
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:26,429
Watch it, freak.

901
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,949
Go back to Treasure Island.

902
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:43,395
Fag.

903
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:45,471
Screw you.

904
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:00,989
Katie, bar the door.
It's time for the championship match

905
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:03,389
here on ESPN8 - the "Ocho".

906
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:07,359
We've seen it all here, folks.
Grit, determination, incontinence.

907
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,908
And it's all come down to this -
a Cinderella story.

908
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:14,596
Average Joe's Gymnasium hopes to
drive their vorpal blade snicker-snack

909
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:18,559
into the heart of the dodgeball Jabberwocky
that is the Globo Gym Purple Cobras,

910
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:22,315
and walk away with $50,000
in stone-cold cash.

911
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:26,359
Hello, everybody, and welcome
to what you've all been waiting for.

912
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:30,115
A David-and-Goliath story
truer than the Bible itself.

913
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:34,159
The championship dodgeball match
here on ESPN8 - the "Ocho".

914
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:38,398
Peter?

915
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,198
Peter?

916
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:44,748
Hello?

917
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:46,114
Peter?

918
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:48,919
Come on, everybody headed down...

919
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:59,871
So what happens on a double fault?

920
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:05,114
On a double fault you go to sudden-death
elimination. It's Continuation Rule 113-D.

921
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,839
- Whatever.
- Hey, guys, wait up.

922
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:13,033
Justin.

923
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:17,113
- I've been looking for you everywhere.
- Really? I mean, why? What's up?

924
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:21,193
Derek fell off the roller coaster
and broke every bone in his body.

925
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:22,679
My God, that's awful.

926
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:26,196
We were the centre Kewpie. With no
centre Kewpie we can't do our routine.

927
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:29,192
- No. I'm sorry.
- You gotta do it.

928
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,872
What?

929
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:32,951
No, no, no, no, no. I can't.

930
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:36,749
Please. You are the only one in Las Vegas
who knows our routine.

931
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:42,198
- The dodgeball championship's at noon.
- You'll be back in time. I promise.

932
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:46,712
- All right, I'll do it.
- Yes.

933
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,836
- I gotta tell the guys.
- No. No time.

934
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:50,512
- I gotta tell the guys.
- No time.

935
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:57,110
Average Joe's are a 50-1 underdog here today.
No one is giving them much of a chance.

936
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:58,952
What do you think, Pep?

937
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:01,110
I spoke to White Goodman before the match

938
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:06,115
and he told me that his team
really wants to win this one.

939
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:09,476
Right. And the stage is set for
Darwin's cruellest play to unfold.

940
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:13,189
So don't go anywhere, folks.
The Schadenfreude is about to begin.

941
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:17,432
- I don't understand. Why would Peter leave?
- He knows we're gonna get killed.

942
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:22,594
Hey. That's not true. I don't know why Peter
left, but we can do this without him.

943
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:25,752
We just have to figure it out.
Owen, you'll have to play.

944
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:29,116
- OK, yeah.
- Great. But we'll still be two players short.

945
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:33,159
We're still missing the teenage love-puppy
and Steve the Pirate.

946
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:35,595
Who's Steve the Pirate?

947
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:39,389
The only guy on our team
who dresses like a pirate.

948
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:43,473
Wait. There's a guy on our team
dressed like a pirate?

949
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:52,429
And now, let's hear it for the West Davenport
High School Charging Donkeys.

950
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:54,511
Donkeys.

951
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:19,678
Go, Donkeys.

952
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:25,312
- We did it.
- Holy cow. My God.

953
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:28,631
- It was perfect. You were perfect.
- God, I gotta go.

954
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,915
Wait. Aren't you gonna stay for the trophy?

955
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,673
I'm sorry, Amber. I got my own trophy to win.

956
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:52,109
Now I'm going.

957
01:06:56,920 --> 01:07:01,471
Here come the Purple Cobras,
led by White Goodman. All business.

958
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:04,996
We haven't seen Average Joe's yet.
They haven't made it to the court.

959
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:08,470
It could be a psychological ploy,
or something worse.

960
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:12,792
They're definitely not on the court, Cotton.
Their absence is noticeable.

961
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:17,476
We'll be right back
after these words from our sponsors...

962
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:21,310
Can I get a bottle of water?

963
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:25,950
Aren't you Peter La Fleur?

964
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:30,555
- Lance Armstrong?
- Yeah, that's me. But I'm a big fan of yours.

965
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:34,349
- Really?
- Yeah, I've been watching the dodgeball.

966
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:39,230
I just can't get enough of it. I'm really pullin'
for you against those jerks from Globo Gym.

967
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:43,116
I think you better hurry up
or you're gonna be late.

968
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:47,512
- Actually, I decided to quit, Lance.
- Quit?

969
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:54,190
Once I thought of quittin', when I had brain,
lung and testicular cancer at the same time.

970
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:57,553
But with the support of my friends
I got back on the bike

971
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:00,234
and I won the Tour de France
five times in a row.

972
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:04,199
But I'm sure you have a good reason to quit.

973
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:07,670
What are you dying from
that's keepin' you from the finals?

974
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:11,799
Right now, it feels a little bit like shame.

975
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:17,477
If people never quit when the going got tough
they'd have nothing to regret all their lives.

976
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:22,350
Good luck to you, Peter. I'm sure
this decision won't haunt you forever.

977
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:32,473
Steve? Steve the Pirate? "Scurvy."

978
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:36,599
- No. Not ringing any bells.
- Forget it, man.

979
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:40,798
We'll play with four people. It's not
an advantage. Can't you bend the rules?

980
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:45,078
There's nothing I can do. Rules are rules.
You don't have enough players.

981
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:49,039
Inform the committee and Mr Goodman
about Average Joe's forfeit.

982
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:52,271
- Yes, sir.
- Better luck next year.

983
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,393
Excuse me.

984
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:58,790
Sorry I'm late. You won't believe
whatjust happened. Hey, guys.

985
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:01,553
You're just in time to help us forfeit.

986
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:03,631
Forfeit? Why?

987
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:08,512
Well, I don't know what to tell you, but...

988
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:12,479
Yes, I'm being told that Average Joe's
does not have enough players

989
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:15,393
and will be forfeiting
the championship match.

990
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:18,438
It's a bold strategy, Cotton.
Let's see if it pays off for 'em.

991
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:23,992
To the tournament floor we go, for the sceptre
presentation from the Dodgeball Chancellor.

992
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:27,709
Ladies and gentlemen,
by the power vested in me

993
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:32,828
by our governing body, the American
Dodgeball Association of America,

994
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:37,436
and in concurrence with our sponsors,
Lumber Liquidators and Omaha Steaks,

995
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:39,590
it gives me great pleasure

996
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:44,390
to declare the winner of this year's
Las Vegas International Tournament to be...

997
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:46,630
Wait. He's here.

998
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:53,593
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.

999
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:55,716
We're ready to play, Your Honour.

1000
01:09:55,800 --> 01:10:00,555
Too late. Your lovable band of losers already
forfeited. The trophy and money are mine.

1001
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:03,996
He's right. The team already forfeited.
There's nothing you can do.

1002
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:06,640
Facial, La Fleur. Total facial.

1003
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,557
Actually, that's not true.

1004
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:13,758
The committee can overrule the chancellor -
that's you, sir - by a two-thirds vote.

1005
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:16,070
He's right. He's right. It's a bylaw.

1006
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:20,674
- It's a bylaw.
- What's a bylaw?

1007
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:25,076
- Hang on a second here, folks.
- Let them play.

1008
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:28,914
We mightjust have a championship game yet.

1009
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,958
Listen to this crowd.

1010
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:34,156
Unbelievable.

1011
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:39,360
Pepper, it's clear what the crowd wants, but
the committee members have the final say.

1012
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:42,557
And it looks like they've come to a decision.

1013
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:45,313
Joe's needs two "yes" votes to play.

1014
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:48,676
- There's a thumbs-up. Good news for Joe's.
- Please.

1015
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:51,832
- Let's see how our second judge votes.
- Thank you.

1016
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:58,792
Oh, tough sledding there. It's all even. Their
fate hangs on the thumb of our final judge.

1017
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:02,236
Thumbs up. Average Joe's can play.

1018
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:05,471
That is pure poppycock.
You're gonna let them do that?

1019
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:08,916
- Thank you, Chuck Norris.
- Thank you, Peter.

1020
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:14,155
All right, captains. Shake hands,
and let's have a clean match.

1021
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:16,231
Good luck, White.

1022
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:20,752
Cram it up your cramhole, La Fleur.

1023
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:24,150
Prepare to be humiliated on cable television.

1024
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:26,231
Whatever.

1025
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:31,192
- Nice of you to show up.
- Yeah, I thought so too.

1026
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:34,078
What? I got a plan.

1027
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:41,711
Let's play smart. Wait for two-on-ones. Cover
closely for your pick-ups. What's our motto?

1028
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,916
- "Aim low".
- That's right.

1029
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,878
All I'm asking is that
you give it your best for Patches.

1030
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:51,078
I say we go out there, let it all hang loose,
try to have some fun.

1031
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:53,720
I mean, it's only dodgeball, right?

1032
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:57,679
- Put 'em in. One, two, three.
- Joe's.

1033
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:22,555
Globo Gym, ready?

1034
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:25,438
Average Joe's, ready?

1035
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:28,595
Dodgeball.

1036
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:33,913
Championship match is under way.
Average Joe's versus the Globo Gym Goliath.

1037
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:37,799
Quick elimination there for Kate Veatch.

1038
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:42,197
White Goodman's hit,
but that ball's up for grabs. And...

1039
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:44,157
- It's caught.
- That's a catch.

1040
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:47,676
- You're out, La Fleur.
- Peter La Fleur has gotta sit down.

1041
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:50,877
And Joe's has lost
their two best players early.

1042
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:53,310
Dwight Baumgarten still playing hard.

1043
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,960
Hits Me'Shell Jones right on the dome.

1044
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:57,951
You're mine next time.

1045
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:05,950
Right in the tokus.
2-1, <i>ese,</i> and Globo Gym is dominating.

1046
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:12,195
- Hi.
- Hey.

1047
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,673
- You're out.
- I don't know what that was,

1048
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:21,356
but it leaves Joe's on the wrong side
of a 4-2 advantage.

1049
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:24,352
Joe's gets an elimination. It's two on three.

1050
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:25,998
Get out.

1051
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,355
Gordo. Lose your temper. Get mad.

1052
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:34,233
White Goodman with a catch. Gordon Pibb
goes out, Me'Shell Jones comes back in.

1053
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,038
You're out, four-eyes.

1054
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:40,398
Well, it's all up to Average Joe's youngest
member. He's gotta make a play here, Pepper.

1055
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:42,118
Word, Cotton.

1056
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:47,354
Four Cobras and one Joe. Even a rabid
mongoose wouldn't have a chance now.

1057
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:50,079
- Nice dodge.
- Stay alive. Stay alive.

1058
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:54,389
They're just toying with the young man now.

1059
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:57,313
He's gotta avoid getting hit. That's the key.

1060
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:59,152
Justin, let's go.

1061
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:01,799
What a great catch.

1062
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:05,111
And another.
Peter La Fleur comes back into the game.

1063
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:09,079
Just like that, a three-player swing.
Joe's isn't done yet.

1064
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:10,718
Justin.

1065
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:13,268
I love you.

1066
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:15,191
I love you t...

1067
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:17,836
Joanie loves Chachi.

1068
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:21,515
Two players left on each side.
What a match. What a sport.

1069
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:27,592
Throw out the rule book, folks,
it's down and dirty now. Street dodgeball.

1070
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:32,915
Look out. La Fleur goes down -
he's a sitting duck.

1071
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:43,716
How about that, folks? Kate Veatch takes the
bullet for Peter La Fleur. Now that's sacrifice.

1072
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:48,555
As touching a moment as we've seen
on the dodgeball court all tournament.

1073
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:51,880
A blatant cheap shot from White Goodman.

1074
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:56,476
- That's court misconduct. That's a warning.
- Come on. Gimme a break.

1075
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:59,039
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1076
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:01,509
- Jesus. Are you sure?
- Yeah. I'm all right.

1077
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:04,637
- It was an accident. I thought she was in play.
- Not a chance.

1078
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:07,632
We're sweating like greased monkeys.
I can't hold on to a ball.

1079
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:10,837
Sorry, miss, but you're out.
You gotta get off the court.

1080
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:12,638
Watch him, man.

1081
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:14,950
- Hey, Peter.
- Yeah?

1082
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:16,758
Kick his ass.

1083
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:20,357
- Here's the restart.
- Players, to your positions.

1084
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:24,752
Looks like it's gonna be a two-on-one,
a <i>ménage à trois</i> of pain.

1085
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:28,435
Usually you pay double
for that kind of action, Cotton.

1086
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:33,915
You're playing ready dodgeball.
Balls are at your feet.

1087
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,230
Ready? Dodgeball.

1088
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:41,235
It's a cat-and-mouse game, folks.
Peter La Fleur has gotta wait for his shot.

1089
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:46,994
He gets the elimination.

1090
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:53,678
My. Globo Gym wins.
A Cinderella story cast asunder.

1091
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:57,719
Average Joe's has come all this way
for nothing. Absolutely nothing.

1092
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:00,439
They're not gonna get anything, Cotton.

1093
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:05,519
No elimination. Double fault.
You stepped over the line on the throw.

1094
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:09,479
What? You gotta be out of your mind.
That is the worst call I've ever seen.

1095
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:13,758
I'm out here busting my butt and you come in
with a bush-league call like that? Bullcrap.

1096
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:18,675
ADAA Continuation Rule 113-D, sir.
Sudden death.

1097
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:20,159
All right. Bring it.

1098
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:23,550
I don't believe it, folks. Sudden death.

1099
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:25,312
Well, let me tell you,

1100
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:30,997
a double-fault final-play elimination hasn't
occurred since the Helsinki episode of 1919,

1101
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:33,719
and I think we all remember
how that turned out.

1102
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:40,194
Ladies and gentlemen, it's the greatest
happening in sport. Sudden-death dodgeball.

1103
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:42,589
Pepper needs new shorts.

1104
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:47,637
White, Peter, this is sudden death.

1105
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:53,438
Only striking an opposing player eliminates
them. Catching the ball does nothing.

1106
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:57,354
Both feet must remain
in the triangle at all times.

1107
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:01,956
You may throw any time after my call.
Understood?

1108
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:06,515
OK. Let's have a clean match.
Good luck, gentlemen.

1109
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,798
This is it, La Loser.

1110
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:14,749
You ready for the hurricane?

1111
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:19,395
Just don't go cryin' to mama when
I spank you in front of all these people.

1112
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:25,355
You don't go crying to your daddy
after I wipe it up with your face.

1113
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:29,718
- White?
- Yeah?

1114
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:34,237
- You look awful fat in those pants.
- Players, to your positions.

1115
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:37,949
This is about gamesmanship.
Throw early and you're defenceless.

1116
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:43,876
Throw late and you're eliminated.
Dilemma, thy name is dodgeball.

1117
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:46,952
This sport doesn't build character,
it reveals it.

1118
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:49,998
Effin' A, Cotton. Effin' A.

1119
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:53,751
Come on, talk to me.

1120
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:57,430
Listen up, crotch stain.

1121
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:01,718
Remember your training
and trust your instincts.

1122
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:04,473
You can do it. I believe in you.

1123
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:08,998
Bye-bye.

1124
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:10,069
Right.

1125
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:12,958
Players, turn and step in.

1126
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:30,548
What the hell's he doing?

1127
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:33,154
I don't know.

1128
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:36,394
Get a load of this guy.

1129
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:40,109
In 23 years of broadcasting
I thought I'd seen it all, folks.

1130
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:43,954
But it looks like Peter La Fleur
has actually blindfolded himself.

1131
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:46,713
He will not be able to see very well, Cotton.

1132
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:58,348
Ready?

1133
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:05,315
Dodgeball.

1134
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:13,275
Goodbye, Peter.

1135
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:16,079
I always knew you were weak.

1136
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:22,113
Air Goodman, comin' at ya.

1137
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:32,632
Down goes Goodman.
Down goes Goodman.

1138
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:35,917
Winner. Average Joe's.

1139
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:42,789
Do you believe in unlikelihoods?

1140
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:45,997
Average Joe's shocking the dodgeball world

1141
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:50,119
and upsetting Globo Gym
in the championship match.

1142
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:51,519
Unbelievable.

1143
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:55,878
I have been to the Great Wall of China.
I have seen the Pyramids of Egypt.

1144
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:58,474
I've even witnessed a grown man
satisfy a camel.

1145
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,790
But never in all my years as a sportscaster

1146
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:05,829
have I witnessed something as improbable,
as impossible, as what we've witnessed here.

1147
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:10,516
The little team that could, Average Joe's
Gymnasium, underdogs throughout,

1148
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:15,276
stand before us, aglow,
as true dodgeball champions.

1149
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:19,831
On behalf of the American Dodgeball
Association of America,

1150
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:24,232
it is my honour to present to you
this cheque for $50,000.

1151
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:33,198
What are you so happy about, La Fleur?
None of this matters.

1152
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:37,592
You signed your gym over to me last night,
remember? You lost, I won.

1153
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:39,750
Suck failure, freaks.

1154
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:42,957
Peter, is that true?

1155
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:44,951
Yeah, it's true.

1156
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:48,237
It's true I sold Average Joe's to White.

1157
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:50,675
It's true that every man has his price.

1158
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:55,550
And it's also true that money won
is a lot sweeter than money earned.

1159
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:59,838
- Now he's a philosophiser.
- Excuse us. Step aside, please.

1160
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:03,229
Your winnings, Mr La Fleur.
Congratulations.

1161
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:07,199
- Right on time. I appreciate it. Thank you.
- What is that? What winnings?

1162
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:11,751
Gosh, I totally forgot to tell you. I took the
$100,000 bribe that you gave me last night,

1163
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:14,798
and I put it on us to win.
We were going off at 50-1.

1164
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:18,156
Anyone? Top of your head?
What's 50 times $100,000?

1165
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:19,593
$50,000?

1166
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:23,593
$5 million. Peter, are you kidding me?

1167
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:25,750
Surprise.

1168
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:33,835
Stick it in your ear, La Fleur. I wouldn't sell
you your gym back for all King Midas's silver.

1169
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:38,596
The gym is mine. So you can take your band
of yellow-bellied losers and crawl out of here.

1170
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:41,513
You're right. I can't make you
sell Average Joe's to me.

1171
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:45,275
So I guess I'll just take your advice
and invest in something.

1172
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:49,433
- Say the controlling stake of Globo Gym.
- That's preposterous. I'd never allow it.

1173
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:53,149
Globo Gym is a publicly traded company.
There's nothing you can do about it.

1174
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:58,473
So I would control Globo Gym
and everything that Globo Gym owns,

1175
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:02,553
which, as of last night, is Average Joe's Gym.

1176
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:05,279
I'm your new boss, White.

1177
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:08,636
You can't be my boss. Nobody can.
I'm my own boss. I created myself.

1178
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:11,792
- You're fired, pal.
- You can't do anything to me.

1179
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:15,278
You're going down, La Fleur,
like a sweet muffin.

1180
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:18,830
- Another time, another time.
- You suck, La Fleur.

1181
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:22,631
Give me that.

1182
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:27,868
Man, the blindfold was crazy.

1183
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:31,834
Peter.

1184
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:34,388
Look. It's Steve the Pirate.

1185
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:42,874
I just wanted to tell you
that I thought about what you said, and

1186
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:46,110
I guess you're right.

1187
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:48,475
I'm not really a pirate.

1188
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:52,228
I don't know, Steve.

1189
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:54,436
If you're not a pirate,

1190
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:58,229
who the hell am I gonna split
all that buried treasure with?

1191
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:04,957
Peter...

1192
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:06,837
Gar, Steve.

1193
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:13,752
We missed you.

1194
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:18,232
Hey, you.

1195
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:20,311
Hey, you.

1196
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:23,916
- Joyce?
- Kate.

1197
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:28,638
- I thought you were in Guam.
- I caught an early flight. I wouldn't miss this.

1198
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:30,915
You are amazing.

1199
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:38,831
- I told you she was a lesbian.
- Wow. Good call.

1200
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:42,312
Hey. I'm not a lesbian.

1201
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:43,992
You're not?

1202
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:45,559
No.

1203
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:47,995
I'm bisexual.

1204
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:51,391
Snap.

1205
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:55,316
All right, everybody. Smile big.

1206
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,754
Hi. I'm Peter La Fleur,
owner and operator of Average Joe's Gym.

1207
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:07,355
I'm here to tell you
you're perfectjust the way you are.

1208
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:12,912
But if you feel like losin' a few pounds, gettin'
healthier, and makin' friends in the process,

1209
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,752
Joe's is the place for you.

1210
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:18,150
Don't forget that youth dodgeball classes
are forming right now.

1211
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:22,916
So come on down and learn a great game the
way it's supposed to be played. Right, kids?

1212
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,991
Right.

1213
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:36,156
Spare me.

1214
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:38,629
I won that tournament.

1215
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:43,919
Fucking Chuck Norris.

1216

1218
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:44,917
Yeah. I hope you're all happy now.

1219
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,434
Good guy wins, bad guy loses.

1220
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:49,988
Big friggin' surprise.

1221
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:52,951
I love happy endings.

1222
01:27:55,840 --> 01:28:00,038
You know, that's the problem
with the American cinema.

1223
01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:02,509
Can't handle any complexity in it, you know?

1224
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:06,639
"Don't make me think,
I just wanna be entertained."

1225
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:08,551
All right, fine.

1226
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:12,155
You want a little somethin'-somethin'
for the ride home?

1227
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:14,629
Check these boots out for size.

1228
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:18,516
My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard

1229
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:20,670
And they're like, "It's better than yours"

1230
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:22,637
Damn right, it's better than yours

1231
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:25,280
I could teach you, but I'd have to charge

1232
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:30,273
What the boys go crazy for

1233
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:32,675
They lose their minds

1234
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:35,035
My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard

1235
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:36,838
Damn right, it's better than yours

1236
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:40,390
I could teach you, but I'd have to charge

1237
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:44,998
You happy? Fatty make a funny?
