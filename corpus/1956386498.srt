00:09:03,536 --> 00:09:05,201
I mean... Wow.

179
00:09:05,636 --> 00:09:06,636
That's a legacy.

180
00:09:10,168 --> 00:09:11,400
- Charlotte?
- Hmm?

181
00:09:11,402 --> 00:09:13,666
I would like to endorse you

182
00:09:13,668 --> 00:09:16,268
to be the next president
of the United States.

183
00:09:18,301 --> 00:09:22,066
I mean, if you think that's
a good idea, sir, I trust you.

184
00:09:22,068 --> 00:09:24,733
I'd... I'd be honored.

185
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:28,666
I'm gonna be pulling
for Team Charlotte. Right?

186
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,603
Because you've been
a great secretary.

187
00:09:31,302 --> 00:09:32,501
...of state.

188
00:09:32,503 --> 00:09:34,800
Whatever. It's a cool job.

189
00:09:34,802 --> 00:09:37,166
And, um, you've done it well.

190
00:09:37,168 --> 00:09:39,666
- Thank you, sir.
- So stay focused.

191
00:09:39,668 --> 00:09:41,200
Don't make
any major screw-ups.

192

- Probably not a problem for you.

I don't know what you're into.
Whatever.

195

Secretary of State
Charlotte Field.

205
00:10:10,102 --> 00:10:11,334
Good morning.

206

(TOUR GUIDE CONTINUES
SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

(QUIETLY) Yes!

208
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:20,766
So the headline is,
"You're in great shape."

209
00:10:20,768 --> 00:10:23,434
- Ninety-two, that's good.
- Really good.

210
00:10:23,436 --> 00:10:25,133
- Yeah.
- KATHERINE: And now, keep in mind

211
00:10:25,135 --> 00:10:27,666
that these are numbers
for a female candidate.

212
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:31,067
If you were a man, you'd be
in the 192nd percentile.

213
00:10:31,069 --> 00:10:33,234
- Well, that seems about right.
- Yeah.

214
00:10:33,236 --> 00:10:35,334
'Cause the man... Okay.

215
00:10:35,336 --> 00:10:38,367
Um, your sense of humor is 82,

216
00:10:38,369 --> 00:10:40,633
which is solid. It's solid.

217
00:10:40,635 --> 00:10:42,733
But, you know, we wouldn't
mind seeing those numbers

218
00:10:42,735 --> 00:10:45,100
go up a few points, or more.

219
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:47,300
So, I'm going to get
some writing samples from

220
00:10:47,302 --> 00:10:48,834
- some funny speech writers.
- Great.

221
00:10:48,836 --> 00:10:52,167
I am really interested
in knowing how people feel

222
00:10:52,169 --> 00:10:54,100
- about my accomplishments.
- Yeah.

223
00:10:54,102 --> 00:10:55,733
Right. You know, so we don't

224
00:10:55,735 --> 00:10:59,734
drill down
on specific policies.

225
00:10:59,736 --> 00:11:02,834
And that's only because
people don't seem to care.

226
00:11:02,836 --> 00:11:04,234
That's interesting.

227
00:11:04,236 --> 00:11:07,600
With that said, if you could
broker some deal

228
00:11:07,602 --> 00:11:09,133
that gets you
out there talking

229
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:10,501
about a thing that you feel

230
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,633
really strongly about,
that would be great.

231
00:11:12,635 --> 00:11:13,566
CHARLOTTE:
Well, that's perfect.

232
00:11:13,568 --> 00:11:15,667
I mean, we've been
looking for an opening

233
00:11:15,669 --> 00:11:17,602
to start a conversation
about the environment.

234
00:11:18,402 --> 00:11:21,067
(CHUCKLES) All right.

235
00:11:21,069 --> 00:11:23,834
Romantically, if I may...

236
00:11:23,836 --> 00:11:26,834
Remember the stir online

237
00:11:26,836 --> 00:11:29,434
when the Canadian
Prime Minister and you

238
00:11:29,436 --> 00:11:31,334
were seated next to each other

239
00:11:31,336 --> 00:11:32,834
at The Global Business Forum?

240
00:11:32,836 --> 00:11:34,234
Mmm-hmm.

241
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:36,367
A relationship like that

242
00:11:36,369 --> 00:11:39,135
would push you
into the high 90s.

243
00:11:39,569 --> 00:11:42,200

CHARLOTTE: What's wrong
with my wave?

246
00:11:49,202 --> 00:11:51,200
Um, I think people feel that

247
00:11:51,202 --> 00:11:54,234
that level of elbow movement
is, um...

248
00:11:54,236 --> 00:11:55,734
It stresses people out.

249
00:11:55,736 --> 00:11:58,734
You know what? It's just
an area for improvement.

250
00:11:58,736 --> 00:12:00,501
Okay, fine,
I'll work on the wave.

a harsh reaction...

A harsh reaction?

263

- Fred, this is a good thing.
- How?

that we've been fighting
against since day one!

to fight giant media conglomerates.

by a giant media conglomerate.

No, they couldn't prove that.

280

We proved it! I wrote
three articles about it!

the math on that one.

a little too much.

has to get him fucked up.

kinda like me,</i>

518
00:21:50,639 --> 00:21:52,403
<i>and I felt like
we were having a moment.</i>

519
00:21:52,405 --> 00:21:54,570
You know what I mean?
Like a romantic moment.

520
00:21:54,572 --> 00:21:55,637
Oh, shit.

521
00:21:55,639 --> 00:21:57,237
FRED: <i>So I did something,</i>

522
00:21:57,239 --> 00:21:59,337
<i>that in retrospect
was highly inappropriate.</i>

523
00:21:59,339 --> 00:22:00,639
<i>I kissed her.</i>

524
00:22:01,305 --> 00:22:02,637
I looked down...

525
00:22:02,639 --> 00:22:04,805
<i>I got a fucking
13-year-old boner, man!</i>

526
00:22:04,807 --> 00:22:07,637
- Oh!
- Hard... But not big.

527
00:22:07,639 --> 00:22:10,437
But hard. And pronounced,
"13-year-old boner."

528
00:22:10,439 --> 00:22:11,437
Sorry.

529
00:22:11,439 --> 00:22:13,405
And she looks at it.
She sees it. And she goes...

530
00:22:14,172 --> 00:22:15,237
It's okay.

531
00:22:15,239 --> 00:22:16,738
- (GROANS)
- And then,

532
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,604
her boyfriend comes
into the room,

533
00:22:18,606 --> 00:22:20,303
who was in the other room
watching <i>Blossom!</i>

534
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:21,370
Hey, babe.

535
00:22:21,372 --> 00:22:23,237
Points out my fucking
little boner.

536
00:22:23,239 --> 00:22:25,638
- <i>He makes a joke!</i>
- Whoa!

537
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,172
FRED: <i>And they left.</i>

538
00:22:27,807 --> 00:22:29,339
(MOUTHING) I'm sorry.

539
00:22:31,372 --> 00:22:34,439
And I'm left
standing there alone...

540
00:22:35,272 --> 00:22:36,237
...in the kitchen,

541
00:22:36,239 --> 00:22:39,237
with my little, hard
13-year-old fucking boner.

542
00:22:39,239 --> 00:22:41,403
- Hard as a rock.
- And on top of that,

543
00:22:41,405 --> 00:22:43,070
she didn't win
the fucking election.

544
00:22:43,072 --> 00:22:45,771
Bill Sterling won because
he ran on a two-prom platform.

545
00:22:45,773 --> 00:22:48,805
- Two-prom!
- Two-proms! Back-to-back!

546
00:22:48,807 --> 00:22:51,170
(SCOFFS) She didn't stand
a fucking chance.

547
00:22:51,172 --> 00:22:52,303
No, man.

548
00:22:52,305 --> 00:22:54,337
I think you're skimming over
the best part of that story.

549
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:56,070
What's the best part
of that story?

550
00:22:56,072 --> 00:22:57,837
She says your boner was okay.

551
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:59,638
She said, "It's okay,"
like she was trying

552
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,471
to not make me
fucking feel bad.

553
00:23:01,473 --> 00:23:03,471
Fred, you see
a fucked-up story,

554
00:23:03,473 --> 00:23:07,203
when I see a beautiful story
about a girl that you liked,

555
00:23:07,205 --> 00:23:10,337
liking your boner
in all of its okay-ness.

556
00:23:10,339 --> 00:23:12,404
You need
to talk to her tonight.

557
00:23:12,406 --> 00:23:13,671
She probably doesn't remember
who I am,

558
00:23:13,673 --> 00:23:15,371
and if she does remember
who I am,

559
00:23:15,373 --> 00:23:16,538
the last thing she wants is

560
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,638
my 13-year-old-boner-having
fucking ass walking up to her.

561
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,705
- Look...
- AGENT M: Excuse me.

562
00:23:19,707 --> 00:23:20,738
Whoa.

563
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,404
Secretary Field would
like to speak with you.

564
00:23:22,406 --> 00:23:23,638
With me?

565
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,070
With him, right?

566
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:26,837
- Yeah.
- FRED: Right now?

567
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:28,438
Uh, do you know why?

568
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,540
This way.

569
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,804
(SOFTLY) This is good.

570
00:23:31,806 --> 00:23:33,238
What are you
nervous about?

571
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,505
What the fuck?
Everything I just said!

572
00:23:35,507 --> 00:23:37,507
(SINGING SLOW R&B SONG)

573
00:23:45,138 --> 00:23:47,103
Oh, my God, dude,
there she is.

574
00:23:47,105 --> 00:23:49,105
(BOYZ II MEN VOCALIZING)

575
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,471
What are you gonna
say to her?

576
00:23:57,473 --> 00:23:59,071
I don't know.

577
00:23:59,073 --> 00:24:00,438
Should open with a neg.

578
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,738
Tell her she's too tall.

579
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,638
I'm not gonna neg
the secretary of state.

580
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,573
- It was so nice to see you.
- WOMAN: You as well.

581
00:24:07,707 --> 00:24:10,505
Give me the signal
when you need me.

582
00:24:10,507 --> 00:24:12,638
- Hi.
- Hi.

583
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,071
A man brought me here.

584
00:24:14,073 --> 00:24:15,605
Yes, sorry about that.

585
00:24:15,607 --> 00:24:16,638
- Um...
- No, not at all.

586
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,505
I can't shake this feeling
that we know each other.

587
00:24:19,507 --> 00:24:21,137
- We do. Yeah.
- We do?

588
00:24:21,139 --> 00:24:22,538
- We do know each other.
- Okay, so I'm not crazy.

589
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,837
- Uh, I'm Fred.
- Fred...

590
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:26,137
I was shorter,

591
00:24:26,139 --> 00:24:27,571
- but other than that...
- Flarsky?

592
00:24:27,573 --> 00:24:28,638
Yeah! Holy fuck!

593
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,338
I can't believe it.
You remember.

594
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,605
Oh, my God,
look at you!

595
00:24:32,607 --> 00:24:33,804
Look at me, yes.

596
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,071
What are you doing here?

597
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:37,571
My friend, Lance...
That's Lance.

598
00:24:37,573 --> 00:24:38,605
Hey, how you doing?

599
00:24:38,607 --> 00:24:41,271
He, uh, he just brought me
here to see Boyz II Men.

600
00:24:41,273 --> 00:24:42,404
I just met them.

601
00:24:42,406 --> 00:24:44,238
- You met the Men?
- Yeah.

602
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,838
- What was it like?
- Don't tell anybody,

603
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,338
but it was
the highlight of my life.

604
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,471
Oh, I totally get that.

605
00:24:48,473 --> 00:24:49,471
And I've met
the Dalai Lama.

606
00:24:49,473 --> 00:24:52,137
Fuck him. How many hits
does he have? None.

607
00:24:52,139 --> 00:24:54,071
- (BOTH LAUGH)
- Don't actually fuck him.

608
00:24:54,073 --> 00:24:55,204
- He's a wonderful man.
- Yeah.

609
00:24:55,206 --> 00:24:56,638
What are you doing
these days?

610
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,507
I bet it's
something amazing.

611
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,505
- It's pretty amazing.
- Yeah.

612
00:25:01,507 --> 00:25:02,571
Uh, yeah,

613
00:25:02,573 --> 00:25:05,171
but it's still in its, uh,
gestation period, I guess.

614
00:25:05,173 --> 00:25:06,338
I don't need to get into it.

615
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,440
What about you,
what have you been up to?

616
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:09,571
You're the secretary...
I'm joking.

617
00:25:09,573 --> 00:25:10,705
I know what
you've been up to.

618
00:25:10,707 --> 00:25:11,905
- Yeah. (LAUGHS)
- You're very, um...

619
00:25:11,907 --> 00:25:14,271
You know, I just, I... I just
wanna say it's, like, amazing

620
00:25:14,273 --> 00:25:15,338
to see what you've done
with your life.

621
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,471
A lot of people say
they're gonna do

622
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,571
all this incredible stuff
and they don't do anything,

623
00:25:18,573 --> 00:25:21,206
but you actually did it all,
so, congrats.

624
00:25:22,574 --> 00:25:24,538
Well, I'm trying.

625
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,073
I think you've done it.
(CHUCKLES)

626
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,039
PARKER: Oh!

627
00:25:30,206 --> 00:25:31,506
CHARLOTTE: Parker Wembley.

628
00:25:31,508 --> 00:25:32,771
I hate this guy.

629
00:25:32,773 --> 00:25:35,404
FRED: Parker Wembley, the guy
who buys and sells newspapers

630
00:25:35,406 --> 00:25:37,506
and thinks that hurricanes
are caused by gay marriage?

631
00:25:37,508 --> 00:25:38,572
You know him?

632
00:25:38,574 --> 00:25:39,771
He's coming over here.

633
00:25:39,773 --> 00:25:41,539
- Is he behind me?
- Yeah.

634
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:45,137
- Finally. Secretary Field.
- Parker, how are you?

635
00:25:45,139 --> 00:25:47,304
You are looking
particularly gorgeous tonight.

636
00:25:47,306 --> 00:25:48,606
Thank you.

637
00:25:48,608 --> 00:25:50,771
I... I've been trying
to set a meeting with you

638
00:25:50,773 --> 00:25:53,372
for some months now,
and, uh...

639
00:25:53,374 --> 00:25:55,137
I mean, have you been
avoiding me?

640
00:25:55,139 --> 00:25:58,137
No! No.

641
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:00,273
- Not successfully.
- (BOTH LAUGH)

642
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,304
(LAUGHS AWKWARDLY)
Who's your friend?

643
00:26:04,306 --> 00:26:06,171
- Fred.
- Hey, Fred!

644
00:26:06,173 --> 00:26:07,238
- Yes, hi.
- How are you?

645
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,204
And, uh, what is it
that you do?

646
00:26:09,206 --> 00:26:11,238
I'm a journalist,
actually. Yeah.

647
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,071
- Ooh, a journalist.
- Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

648
00:26:13,073 --> 00:26:15,472
Will I have read
anything that you've written?

649
00:26:15,474 --> 00:26:18,272
Probably not recently 'cause
I'm unemployed at the moment.

650
00:26:18,274 --> 00:26:20,171
Oh, I am so sorry
to hear that.

651
00:26:20,173 --> 00:26:21,439
Not your fault.

652
00:26:21,441 --> 00:26:23,372
Excuse me, Secretary Field,
we need a word.

653
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:25,439
- Oh, okay.
- So we will have that meeting.

654
00:26:25,441 --> 00:26:26,506
- Right?
- Yes.

655
00:26:26,508 --> 00:26:28,239
Okay, good. Fred.

656
00:26:28,241 --> 00:26:29,405
- Yes?
- Best of luck.

657
00:26:29,407 --> 00:26:30,472
Oh, why, thanks.

658
00:26:30,474 --> 00:26:31,539
Things will turn around
for you.

659
00:26:31,541 --> 00:26:32,439
So nice of you.

660
00:26:32,441 --> 00:26:34,241
Darkest before the dawn
and all that.

661
00:26:35,773 --> 00:26:38,239
- I actually... I do have to...
- Yeah.

662
00:26:38,241 --> 00:26:39,605
You probably have a lot
of things to do.

663
00:26:39,607 --> 00:26:40,671
Better than this.

664
00:26:40,673 --> 00:26:41,805
It's really nice
to see you again.

665
00:26:41,807 --> 00:26:45,339
- Oh. Yeah. Okay. Sure. Great.
- (LAUGHS)

666
00:26:45,341 --> 00:26:48,372
Oh, you're backless.
Wasn't expecting that.

667
00:26:48,374 --> 00:26:50,239
- Have fun at the party.
- You too.

668
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:51,374
Great to see you.

669
00:26:54,441 --> 00:26:57,405
I see you. I see you. Yeah.

670
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,838
(LAUGHING)

671
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,274
PARKER: So I said,
"You want..."

672
00:27:03,773 --> 00:27:05,172
Hey. Hey.
What's that look in your eye?

673
00:27:05,174 --> 00:27:06,239
What are you
about to go do?

674
00:27:06,241 --> 00:27:08,072
Tonight is
about the animals, dude.

675
00:27:08,074 --> 00:27:10,072
Fuck the animals!
They're fucking gone, man.

676
00:27:10,074 --> 00:27:11,771
Too late
for the fucking animals.

677
00:27:11,773 --> 00:27:13,605
(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

678
00:27:13,607 --> 00:27:15,272
Hey!

679
00:27:15,274 --> 00:27:16,771
- PARKER: Oh, Fred?
- Yeah, look.

680
00:27:16,773 --> 00:27:19,105
- What's the problem?
- I'll tell you the problem.

681
00:27:19,107 --> 00:27:20,638
- What?
- You're the problem, man!

682
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,205
You're everything that's wrong
with this fucking country.

683
00:27:23,207 --> 00:27:26,439
'Cause you're an old,
rich, white piece of shit

684
00:27:26,441 --> 00:27:29,172
and your media conglomerate
is ruining this planet!

685
00:27:29,174 --> 00:27:31,105
- Enough.
- I'm done anyway.

686
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,771
I had more time with you
than I thought I would,

687
00:27:32,773 --> 00:27:34,405
so joke's on you.

00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,758
That's cool. That's a tough
transition to make.

864
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,591
Not many actors have made
the leap from TV to film.

865
00:34:14,593 --> 00:34:16,323
You got George Clooney,
you got Woody Harrelson...

866
00:34:16,325 --> 00:34:17,390
Jennifer Aniston.

867
00:34:17,392 --> 00:34:18,991
Mmm, did she though?

868
00:34:18,993 --> 00:34:20,691
You don't think Jennifer
Aniston's a movie star?

869
00:34:20,693 --> 00:34:21,758
Just 'cause
you star in movies

870
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,824
doesn't mean
you're a movie star.

871
00:34:22,826 --> 00:34:24,958
The point is...

872
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,760
He's going to endorse me
for president in 2020.

873
00:34:28,259 --> 00:34:29,323
Wow.

874
00:34:29,325 --> 00:34:30,658
- I know.
- <i>Mazel tov.</i>

875
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,791
(CHUCKLES) So.

876
00:34:31,793 --> 00:34:33,858
We're headed to
an environmental summit

877
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,289
hosted by King Gustav

878
00:34:35,291 --> 00:34:36,924
and the Swedish Royal Family.

879
00:34:36,926 --> 00:34:39,224
At the summit,
I'll be announcing

880
00:34:39,226 --> 00:34:41,323
that the world's
three largest polluters

881
00:34:41,325 --> 00:34:42,691
have signed on
to the most comprehensive

882
00:34:42,693 --> 00:34:44,691
and exciting
environmental deal ever.

883
00:34:44,693 --> 00:34:45,958
You know,
after I have some dairy,

884
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,824
I'm one of the world's
three largest polluters.

885
00:34:47,826 --> 00:34:48,991
Excuse me?

886
00:34:48,993 --> 00:34:51,391
We'll address
rising sea levels,

887
00:34:51,393 --> 00:34:52,991
combat deforestation

888
00:34:52,993 --> 00:34:55,324
and protect
the world's pollinators.

889
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:58,424
I'm calling it the Global
Rehabilitation Initiative.

890
00:34:58,426 --> 00:34:59,691
Internally,
we're referring to it

891
00:34:59,693 --> 00:35:00,991
as "Bees, Trees and the Seas."

892
00:35:00,993 --> 00:35:02,524
CHARLOTTE: Soon after that,

893
00:35:02,526 --> 00:35:04,858
I hope to announce that
100 countries have signed on.

894
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:07,357
- Wow.
- At which point...

895
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,724
I will resign
as secretary of state.

896
00:35:09,726 --> 00:35:12,724
Using this initiative
as a springboard,

897
00:35:12,726 --> 00:35:14,924
I will announce
my presidential run in 2020.

898
00:35:14,926 --> 00:35:16,526
- Cool.
- So...

899
00:35:18,426 --> 00:35:20,991
I need some writers
to punch up my speeches.

900
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:23,324
I read your work
and I really like it.

901
00:35:23,326 --> 00:35:24,524
That's... Wow.

902
00:35:24,526 --> 00:35:26,224
You mentioned
you were between jobs.

903
00:35:26,226 --> 00:35:27,191
So it's a really good fit.

904
00:35:27,193 --> 00:35:29,758
It's so nice of you
to think of me at all,

905
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,257
honestly, with everything
going on in your head.

906
00:35:32,259 --> 00:35:33,557
I look forward
to working with you.

907
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:34,559
Thank you.

908
00:35:36,693 --> 00:35:39,559
Um... So, uh,
when do you need to know by?

909
00:35:40,826 --> 00:35:42,958
(CHUCKLING) What?
I don't understand.

910
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,992
When do you need to know if
I'm going to take your, uh,

911
00:35:44,994 --> 00:35:46,559
your punch-up job?

912
00:35:47,961 --> 00:35:49,424
Right now.

913
00:35:49,426 --> 00:35:51,992
Oh. Uh...
Then I guess,

914
00:35:51,994 --> 00:35:54,691
maybe... Maybe, uh, no?

915
00:35:54,693 --> 00:35:56,959
Maybe no, I don't know.
I don't know!

916
00:35:56,961 --> 00:35:58,059
You know what,
Madam Secretary,

917
00:35:58,061 --> 00:35:59,992
he's not interested.
We tried, it didn't work out.

918
00:35:59,994 --> 00:36:02,760
So I can give you
some writing samples...

919
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,758
What don't you know?

920
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,290
This whole Seas, Bees
and Trees thing.

921
00:36:12,292 --> 00:36:13,925
Is it actually
going to do something?

922
00:36:13,927 --> 00:36:15,591
Or is it going to be
one of those things

923
00:36:15,593 --> 00:36:17,624
that maybe only sounds like
it's gonna do something,

924
00:36:17,626 --> 00:36:19,357
but doesn't
actually do something?

925
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,892
I only wanna come work for you

926
00:36:21,894 --> 00:36:23,457
if it's actually
gonna do something.

927
00:36:23,459 --> 00:36:24,759
It will do something.

928
00:36:24,761 --> 00:36:26,624
This is a perfect document.

929
00:36:26,626 --> 00:36:28,925
They all start out that way
and then they get watered down.

930
00:36:28,927 --> 00:36:29,859
Fred.

931
00:36:29,861 --> 00:36:32,324
Not only does this
initiative sound good,

932
00:36:32,326 --> 00:36:33,190
it's going to do good.

933
00:36:33,192 --> 00:36:35,557
It's gonna save
the fucking planet.

934
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:37,725
Not to mention,
pay your rent.

935
00:36:37,727 --> 00:36:38,992
So, are you in?

936
00:36:38,994 --> 00:36:41,627
Or do you have something
more important to do?

937
00:36:42,627 --> 00:36:44,292
Than save the planet with you?

938
00:36:45,994 --> 00:36:48,625
No, I don't. (CHUCKLES)
I'm in.

939
00:36:48,627 --> 00:36:50,457
Phew! (CHUCKLES)

940
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:51,727
Let's save the planet.

941
00:36:52,393 --> 00:36:53,357
That was...

942
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:55,459
What just happened?
She's good. (LAUGHS)

943
00:37:19,927 --> 00:37:20,992
(KNOCKS ON DOOR)

944
00:37:20,994 --> 00:37:21,961
FRED: Uh, hey.

945
00:37:23,894 --> 00:37:25,892
I had some jokes, uh,
I was gonna run by you,

946
00:37:25,894 --> 00:37:27,326
maybe, if you have a second.

947
00:37:30,627 --> 00:37:33,226
What are you...
What are you looking at?

948
00:37:36,427 --> 00:37:37,625
- (GASPS)
- (YELPS)

949
00:37:37,627 --> 00:37:38,692
- Jesus!
- Oh, my God!

950
00:37:38,694 --> 00:37:40,925
Why would you just barge
in here while I'm sleeping?

951
00:37:40,927 --> 00:37:42,458
- You were sleeping?
- Yes!

952
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,224
I was micro napping.

953
00:37:44,226 --> 00:37:45,992
- That's what you call that?
- Yes.

954
00:37:45,994 --> 00:37:47,659
Sorry, I didn't realize
you were sleeping.

955
00:37:47,661 --> 00:37:49,225
You were standing
and your eyes were open.

956
00:37:49,227 --> 00:37:50,291
Do you need something?

957
00:37:50,293 --> 00:37:51,392
I have some jokes
that I wrote

958
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:53,392
that I was gonna run by you
if you have a second.

959
00:37:53,394 --> 00:37:54,859
Yeah, that was actually
a really good nap.

960
00:37:54,861 --> 00:37:56,892
Great. Seemed very restful.

961
00:37:56,894 --> 00:37:57,894
(SIGHS) Okay.

962
00:38:00,794 --> 00:38:01,725
Whoa.

963
00:38:01,727 --> 00:38:05,325
I feel like these jokes
are a little angry.

964
00:38:05,327 --> 00:38:07,625
Oh. I thought maybe
they were, like, emphatic?

965
00:38:07,627 --> 00:38:09,525
"With every
fracking drill thrust,

966
00:38:09,527 --> 00:38:12,358
"we are literally
butt-fucking Mother Earth"?

967
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,525
It can be normal fucking.

968
00:38:13,527 --> 00:38:14,892
It doesn't have to be
in the butt.

969
00:38:14,894 --> 00:38:15,959
I can take that part out.

970
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:17,525
Yeah, listen, Fred.

971
00:38:17,527 --> 00:38:18,925
If I'm angry,
I'm hysterical.

972
00:38:18,927 --> 00:38:20,525
If I'm emotional,
I'm weak.

973
00:38:20,527 --> 00:38:22,258
If I so much as
raise my voice, I'm a bitch.

974
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,525
My job's hard.

975
00:38:23,527 --> 00:38:25,492
Not as hard as mine.

976
00:38:25,494 --> 00:38:27,291
I think maybe, like,
part of the problem

977
00:38:27,293 --> 00:38:29,558
is that, like, a lot of humor
is based on,

978
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,692
like, personal experiences.

979
00:38:31,694 --> 00:38:32,592
I was thinking, you know,

980
00:38:32,594 --> 00:38:34,558
you cared a lot
about the environment

981
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,725
- since high school.
- Mmm-hmm.

982
00:38:35,727 --> 00:38:39,458
So maybe include
some stories about that.

983
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,827
- High school?
- Yeah.

984
00:38:42,394 --> 00:38:43,659
You think that's funny?

985
00:38:43,661 --> 00:38:44,759
I think it's a good area.

986
00:38:44,761 --> 00:38:46,825
Nostalgia,
pop culture references.

987
00:38:46,827 --> 00:38:47,926
People love that.

988
00:38:47,928 --> 00:38:49,759
Jimmy Fallon's made
an entire career off of that.

989
00:38:49,761 --> 00:38:51,926
When I think about school,
I just think about studying.

990
00:38:51,928 --> 00:38:53,525
No, you did
so much more than that.

991
00:38:53,527 --> 00:38:56,225
I think your whole 1991
platform was pretty on-point

992
00:38:56,227 --> 00:38:57,558
when you were running
for Student Council.

993
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,392
I remember you said,
"Everyone at this school

994
00:39:00,394 --> 00:39:02,592
"pretends to care
about the underdog,

995
00:39:02,594 --> 00:39:03,760
"but the planet Earth is

996
00:39:03,762 --> 00:39:04,960
"the biggest underdog
of them all."

997
00:39:04,962 --> 00:39:06,258
Something like that.

998
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,358
I said that?

999
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,760
Yeah, you did say that.

1000
00:39:08,762 --> 00:39:10,659
You were in the kitchen,
making pizza.

1001
00:39:10,661 --> 00:39:13,458
We were making signs
for your election.

1002
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,693
And you were
wearing that shirt.

1003
00:39:15,695 --> 00:39:17,659
I don't know if it was
a strawberry or a flower,

1004
00:39:17,661 --> 00:39:18,895
it always confused me.

1005
00:39:19,427 --> 00:39:20,492
It was both.

1006
00:39:20,494 --> 00:39:22,425
Oh, there you go.

1007
00:39:22,427 --> 00:39:24,258
That's all I remember
about that night, though.

1008
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,793
Uh, that's where my memories

1009
00:39:25,795 --> 00:39:29,291
concerning that evening
expire.

1010
00:39:29,293 --> 00:39:31,760
I learned a lot
from that election.

1011
00:39:31,762 --> 00:39:33,325
Yeah, that kids are
probably more likely

1012
00:39:33,327 --> 00:39:34,726
to vote for two proms

1013
00:39:34,728 --> 00:39:37,225
than a very elaborate
recycling program.

1014
00:39:37,227 --> 00:39:38,826
- (CHUCKLES)
- Not only kids.

1015
00:39:38,828 --> 00:39:41,760
Yeah, that's true.

1016
00:39:41,762 --> 00:39:45,593
Did you know he asked me out
to one of those proms?

1017
00:39:45,595 --> 00:39:46,760
- Bill Sterling?
- Yeah.

1018
00:39:46,762 --> 00:39:47,926
After he beat you?

1019
00:39:47,928 --> 00:39:50,260
- Yup.
- Prom one or prom two?

1020
00:39:51,595 --> 00:39:52,593
Oh!

1021
00:39:52,595 --> 00:39:55,425
What a fuckhead!
You're way better than prom two.

1022
00:39:55,427 --> 00:39:56,526
(SIGHS AND LAUGHS)

1023
00:39:56,528 --> 00:39:59,225
I went to zero proms,
by the way, for the record.

1024
00:39:59,227 --> 00:40:01,325
I think you're the smart one
in this situation.

1025
00:40:01,327 --> 00:40:03,426
Yes, that's why
I didn't go to prom.

1026
00:40:03,428 --> 00:40:06,662
'Cause I was too smart. Uh...

1027
00:40:08,795 --> 00:40:11,726
Cool. I'll get to work on
that speech stuff.

1028
00:40:11,728 --> 00:40:12,728
Great.

1029
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,325
Hey, Fred.

1030
00:40:14,327 --> 00:40:16,291
Yeah.

1031
00:40:16,293 --> 00:40:18,593
You know, if you want to try
some non-joke stuff,

1032
00:40:18,595 --> 00:40:19,526
just go ahead.

1033
00:40:19,528 --> 00:40:22,526
Really? Like the main part
of the speech?

1034
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:24,561
Yeah. Just write.

1035
00:40:25,762 --> 00:40:27,428
Cool. Awesome. Thanks.

1036
00:40:27,994 --> 00:40:29,158
If you take another nap,

1037
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,559
you should put on, like,
a bicycle helmet or something.

there's turbulence.

That's actually
a really good idea.

1040
00:40:35,228 --> 00:40:36,359
It is. I want you
to be careful.

Do you have any grown-up
clothes to wear tonight?

1088

I was gonna...
I was thinking

1089
00:42:24,461 --> 00:42:26,727
of zipping this up
all the way, like to here.

1090

a little more...

slightly more buttoned up.

Madam Secretary,

1093
00:42:30,328 --> 00:42:34,359
I would be delighted
to dress Fred for tonight.

1094

Losing the Seas part, why?

Because India wouldn't go
for it. So we had to pivot.

out here to have a smoke,

1205
00:46:40,863 --> 00:46:43,694
you fucking got rid of a massive
element of the whole thing.

1206
00:46:43,696 --> 00:46:46,995
I got two out of three.
I only lost one.

1207
00:46:46,997 --> 00:46:50,228
That one was the seas.

1208
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:52,661
It covers 75% of the planet!

1209
00:46:52,663 --> 00:46:54,594
- It's a pretty big one!
- Bring down your voice.

1210
00:46:54,596 --> 00:46:55,694
You know why I'm upset?

1211
00:46:55,696 --> 00:46:57,794
This is exactly what I thought
was going to happen.

1212
00:46:57,796 --> 00:46:59,928
And I even said it.
I said it in your office.

1213
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:02,694
I don't want to write
for some bullshit politician.

1214
00:47:02,696 --> 00:47:03,962
I wanted to write for you.

1215
00:47:03,964 --> 00:47:05,694
Because I thought you cared
about this shit.

1216
00:47:05,696 --> 00:47:08,495
Until you're running the game,
you have to play the game.

1217
00:47:08,497 --> 00:47:10,428
Well, then, by the time
you win the game,

1218
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:13,560
you don't know who's scoring
touchdowns on whose nets,

1219
00:47:13,562 --> 00:47:15,428
and you don't know
who's hitting home runs

1220
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:16,895
in whose fucking end zones!

1221
00:47:16,897 --> 00:47:18,461
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know sports.

1222
00:47:18,463 --> 00:47:19,694
Let me try it with food.

1223
00:47:19,696 --> 00:47:21,962
You wanna open a restaurant.
But all you got is chopsticks.

1224
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:24,661
No! I don't have time
for this, okay?

1225
00:47:24,663 --> 00:47:27,361
If you want to quit,
then just fucking quit.

1226
00:47:27,363 --> 00:47:29,228
- I don't give a shit.
- Yeah, you don't give a shit.

1227
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:30,261
- No, I don't.
- You used to fucking give a shit,

1228
00:47:30,263 --> 00:47:32,495
but now you don't
give a shit about anything.

1229
00:47:32,497 --> 00:47:34,228
You cared more about
recycling in high school

1230
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:36,330
than you do this shit and it's
very disappointing to me.

1231
00:47:37,529 --> 00:47:39,828
Fuck this.
I've got a speech to give.

1232
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:40,995
Oh, yeah, good luck
giving it,

1233
00:47:40,997 --> 00:47:42,328
it's on my computer
in the snow.

1234
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:43,828
I have copies, you idiot.

1235
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:46,196
You just threw your computer
in the snow, that's it.

1236
00:47:47,296 --> 00:47:49,562
Oh, no! Shit!

1237
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:52,795
Oh, God damn it!

1238
00:47:52,797 --> 00:47:55,527
It's soaked!
I need a bowl of rice!

1239
00:47:55,529 --> 00:47:57,263
I need a big bowl of rice!

1240
00:47:58,597 --> 00:48:01,828
God damn it! Why didn't I
back this thing up?

1241
00:48:01,830 --> 00:48:03,397
All my shit's on here.

1242
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:15,230
CHARLOTTE: Fred. Look.

1243
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:20,131
Wow.

1244
00:48:23,997 --> 00:48:26,163
I've never seen
anything like that.

1245
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:29,530
No, I...

1246
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:32,497
I've seen pictures of it,
but I never...

1247
00:48:33,697 --> 00:48:34,697
...actually...

1248
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:38,730
I never saw it. (SNIFFLES)

1249
00:48:39,697 --> 00:48:41,331
Are you crying right now?

1250
00:48:42,263 --> 00:48:43,263
It's pretty.

1251
00:48:47,764 --> 00:48:48,764
Yeah.

1252
00:48:51,331 --> 00:48:52,331
Fred?

1253
00:48:52,764 --> 00:48:53,764
(SNIFFLES) Yeah?

1254
00:48:55,264 --> 00:48:57,495
If you ever pull
some shit like that again,

1255
00:48:57,497 --> 00:48:58,830
I'll have you thrown in Gitmo.

1256
00:49:01,331 --> 00:49:03,197
Yes, Madam Secretary.
I'm sorry.

1257
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:07,430
You better hope this fucking
speech goes over well.

1258
00:49:10,231 --> 00:49:14,428
I've often gravitated
toward the underdog.

1259
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:18,862
The band of misfits who fight
back against the bullies.

1260
00:49:18,864 --> 00:49:21,730
In high school, I would talk
about the underdog a lot.

1261
00:49:23,463 --> 00:49:26,262
And I would often find myself
on a soapbox,

1262
00:49:26,264 --> 00:49:29,664
rambling on and on about
the injustices of the world.

1263
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:35,295
Which makes you
extremely popular,

1264
00:49:35,297 --> 00:49:37,795
especially when everybody
would rather be watching

1265
00:49:37,797 --> 00:49:39,862
<i>Beverly Hills, 90210.</i>

1266
00:49:39,864 --> 00:49:41,497
(ALL LAUGH)

1267
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:46,561
But that is why I am happy
to announce

1268
00:49:46,563 --> 00:49:49,828
an initiative that would make
my 16-year-old self proud.

1269
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:52,329
<i>In what is now being dubbed
"The Underdog Speech,"</i>

Oh, wow, you shaved your neck.

1277
00:50:10,297 --> 00:50:11,561
I did. I cleaned it up.

1278
00:50:11,563 --> 00:50:13,763
Got my whole back.
Went all the way down.

1279
00:50:13,765 --> 00:50:14,929
Looks good.

1280
00:50:14,931 --> 00:50:16,763
Trying to make a good
impression, I guess, anyway...

1281
00:50:16,765 --> 00:50:18,829
I, uh...

1282
00:50:18,831 --> 00:50:22,328
I just wanted to apologize
to you, again,

1283
00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:25,662
for acting a little crazy,
you know.

1284
00:50:25,664 --> 00:50:27,328
I'm gonna...

1285
00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:28,561
I'm going to really try
to tone it down

1286
00:50:28,563 --> 00:50:32,231
and not, you know, make you
risk global, uh, humiliation.

1287
00:50:32,597 --> 00:50:33,698
Good. Great.

1288
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:35,461
Also.

1289
00:50:35,463 --> 00:50:36,996
I googled speech writing

1290
00:50:36,998 --> 00:50:38,796
and it was
actually very informative.

1291
00:50:38,798 --> 00:50:39,763
What I learned

1292
00:50:39,765 --> 00:50:41,063
was that in order to write
better for you,

1293
00:50:41,065 --> 00:50:44,495
I should kinda get to know you
better and get in your head,

1294
00:50:44,497 --> 00:50:45,629
and everything
I already know about you,

1295
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:46,829
I kinda used
on the first speech.

1296
00:50:46,831 --> 00:50:48,295
So, what I did

1297
00:50:48,297 --> 00:50:49,696
was I wrote a ton of questions

1298
00:50:49,698 --> 00:50:51,461
that will maybe help me
capture your voice,

1299
00:50:51,463 --> 00:50:52,763
if you have a minute.

1300
00:50:52,765 --> 00:50:54,629
I actually have seven.

1301
00:50:54,631 --> 00:50:56,796
Seven. Okay, great.
Yeah. I'll take it.

1302
00:50:56,798 --> 00:50:58,294
- All right.
- Seven minutes in heaven.

1303
00:50:58,296 --> 00:50:59,629
(CHUCKLES) Um...

1304
00:50:59,631 --> 00:51:01,596
- Okay. (CLEARS THROAT)
- So. Ah... I guess...

1305
00:51:01,598 --> 00:51:02,763
Just like...
What are you into?

1306
00:51:02,765 --> 00:51:03,963
What kind of shit you into?

1307
00:51:03,965 --> 00:51:05,829
Well, this is
pretty much it.

1308
00:51:05,831 --> 00:51:07,629
I mean,

00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:09,929
Do you have any hobbies?
Anything? Do you watch TV?

1310
00:51:09,931 --> 00:51:11,562
Do you watch <i>Game of Thrones</i>
or anything like that?

1311
00:51:11,564 --> 00:51:13,262
Oh, I'm fully aware
of what happened

1312
00:51:13,264 --> 00:51:14,763
in every season
of <i>Game of Thrones.</i>

1313
00:51:14,765 --> 00:51:16,596
Because you watch it?

1314
00:51:16,598 --> 00:51:18,729
Because I read synopses
on every episode.

1315
00:51:18,731 --> 00:51:20,396

1319
00:51:25,631 --> 00:51:26,729
- See?
- What about movies?

1320
00:51:26,731 --> 00:51:27,996
Do you watch movies?

the award contenders.

00:51:30,263 --> 00:51:31,596

still doing "The Weasel"

any of the Marvel Universe.

- That's all it took.

1372

Look at you.

1373
00:53:08,832 --> 00:53:10,930
Well, what's your favorite
sexual position?

1374
00:53:10,932 --> 00:53:12,964
- Don't be gross, Fred. Hi.
- Yeah, see?

1375
00:53:12,966 --> 00:53:15,164
What's your favorite
sexual position?

1376
00:53:15,866 --> 00:53:17,666
It's too complicated
to explain.

1377
00:53:18,832 --> 00:53:20,598
- Really?
- I told you mine.

I just got back
from a trip to New Delhi.

1380
00:53:25,766 --> 00:53:27,730
- Yeah?
- I got called into a meeting

1381
00:53:27,732 --> 00:53:30,329
with the Joint Chiefs,
and I was a little nervous.

1382
00:53:30,331 --> 00:53:32,462
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1383
00:53:32,464 --> 00:53:36,496

weird from all the curry.

Oh, no.

Well, we were in a motorcade

- Oh, no.
- Mmm-hmm.

God...

1389
00:53:48,866 --> 00:53:52,864
I ruined a really nice
Dolce & Gabbana bag.

1390
00:53:52,866 --> 00:53:55,295
- You puked in it?
- Nope.

I can handle that.

I really liked him

Did I read that

1430
00:55:21,666 --> 00:55:23,630
in some shitty tabloid
that you guys were dating?

1431
00:55:23,632 --> 00:55:26,463
- Maybe it's not true.
- No, I'm sure you did. It's...

- Kind of.

We made out once.

his beard was big.

with you? Do you, like...

Do you, like, date?

1445
00:55:55,399 --> 00:55:59,198
Uh... Yeah. I date.

with people who have
similar lifestyles to me.

People who travel a lot.

1449
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:11,465
It's hard to keep
those things alive. I...

1450
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,230
I mean, who wants to
follow me around the world

and hope I have five minutes
to be affectionate?

- Yeah.
- And honestly,

want to date women

than them.

- Yeah.
- Oh, thank God.

1524

That actually
makes me feel better.

1525
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,532
Means I didn't overreact.

1526
00:59:24,534 --> 00:59:27,266
Oh, God, no, you completely
overreacted. (LAUGHING)

1527
00:59:28,333 --> 00:59:29,501
Yeah, maybe.

1528

Honestly, this has been like,

1531
00:59:39,768 --> 00:59:42,567
the best few weeks
of my entire life.

1532
00:59:45,933 --> 00:59:47,264
You don't have to say it
back to me.

1533
00:59:47,266 --> 00:59:48,532
I know it's not true for you.

1534
00:59:48,534 --> 00:59:50,565
I saw you sing with
Bruce Springsteen last year,

1535
00:59:50,567 --> 00:59:51,931
at that benefit concert.
That was probably

1536
00:59:51,933 --> 00:59:53,399
a way better week.

1537
00:59:53,401 --> 00:59:56,231
Just as an example. (CHUCKLES)

00:59:56,233 --> 00:59:58,666
Well, this is
a pretty close second.

1539
00:59:58,668 --> 01:00:00,765
Really? To The Boss?

1540
01:00:00,767 --> 01:00:01,831
Yeah.

1541
01:00:01,833 --> 01:00:04,166
Wow. That's nice.

1542
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,167
Uh...

1543
01:00:17,833 --> 01:00:20,898
I feel like maybe you want me
to kiss you right now,

1544
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:22,865
but I don't want to make
the same stupid mistake

1545
01:00:22,867 --> 01:00:24,298
I made 25 years ago.

1546
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:26,167
Wouldn't be a stupid mistake.

1547
01:00:26,867 --> 01:00:28,467
Wait... Really?

1548
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,599
We've secured the location.

1549
01:00:36,601 --> 01:00:39,467
But we need to move you.
The helicopter is standing by.

1550
01:00:40,567 --> 01:00:42,267
Thank you, Agent M.

1551
01:00:46,833 --> 01:00:48,232
FRED: Holy shit.

1552
01:00:48,234 --> 01:00:49,298
That helicopter was way louder

1553
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:50,698
than I thought
it was gonna be.

1554
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:52,668
- MAGGIE: Fred, enough. Enough.
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1555
01:00:53,534 --> 01:00:54,632
We're safe here though?

1556
01:00:54,634 --> 01:00:56,298
- MAGGIE: Yes!
- TOM: Oh, my God, Fred!

1557
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:57,365
AGENT: This way.

1558
01:00:57,367 --> 01:00:58,601
FRED: This place
looks really nice.

1559
01:01:02,534 --> 01:01:03,999
Fred, I need you
to come work

1560
01:01:04,001 --> 01:01:05,831
on that speech with me,
right now.

1561
01:01:05,833 --> 01:01:07,901
- Right now?
- Yeah. Right now.

1562
01:01:08,767 --> 01:01:09,868
Okay.

1563
01:01:13,968 --> 01:01:16,232
(BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY)

1564
01:01:16,234 --> 01:01:17,399
Hang on, get my pants off.

1565
01:01:17,401 --> 01:01:18,733
Okay, I gotta, too. Shit.

1566
01:01:20,234 --> 01:01:21,632
- CHARLOTTE: We're doing it?
- Yeah!

1567
01:01:21,634 --> 01:01:22,698
- CHARLOTTE: Do it faster.
- Let's do it.

1568
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:23,700
They're coming off!

1569
01:01:25,667 --> 01:01:27,667
Fucking tapered pants. Shit!

1570
01:01:29,001 --> 01:01:30,200
Fuck!

1571
01:01:31,701 --> 01:01:33,365
CHARLOTTE: Okay, just leave
it! Just leave it! Leave it!

1572
01:01:33,367 --> 01:01:34,832
- FRED: Okay.
- Okay. Yeah.

1573
01:01:34,834 --> 01:01:35,899
Should I go in, then?

1574
01:01:35,901 --> 01:01:37,565
Yeah, enter.

1575
01:01:37,567 --> 01:01:40,832
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, no!

1576
01:01:40,834 --> 01:01:42,966
- I'm gonna come really soon.
- Me too.

1577
01:01:42,968 --> 01:01:44,432
- Really?
- Yeah!

1578
01:01:44,434 --> 01:01:45,499
- Oh, God!
- Oh!

1579
01:01:45,501 --> 01:01:46,899
BOTH: Oh, boy!

1580
01:01:46,901 --> 01:01:49,732
(BOTH MOANING LOUDLY)

1581
01:01:49,734 --> 01:01:52,666
- Oh, God! Okay.
- Oh, my God!

1582
01:01:52,668 --> 01:01:54,566
- I'm coming out.
- Okay, come on.

1583
01:01:54,568 --> 01:02:00,365
Oh, God. Oh! Oh! Oh, fuck!

1584
01:02:00,367 --> 01:02:03,602
Wow. Oh, my God,
I'm sorry.

1585
01:02:04,502 --> 01:02:05,699
I don't know
what happened.

1586
01:02:05,701 --> 01:02:07,899
I usually last
way longer than that.

1587
01:02:07,901 --> 01:02:09,300
- You know?
- Not me.

1588
01:02:10,334 --> 01:02:11,265
That was weird.

1589
01:02:11,267 --> 01:02:12,466
We both said, "Oh, boy"
when we came...

1590
01:02:12,468 --> 01:02:14,433
- Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
- ...at the same time.

1591
01:02:14,435 --> 01:02:15,966
- That's never happened before.
- I've never said that.

1592
01:02:15,968 --> 01:02:19,232
- Yeah.
- Super strange.

1593
01:02:19,234 --> 01:02:20,932
- Oh!
- Should we do that again?

1594
01:02:20,934 --> 01:02:22,600
Yeah, my hands are shaking,
I need a minute.

1595
01:02:22,602 --> 01:02:24,234
(EXHALES)

1596
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:28,932
Hmm.

1597
01:02:28,934 --> 01:02:31,866
- Who's this little guy?
- (LAUGHING)

1598
01:02:31,868 --> 01:02:33,766
I was a writing an article
about neo-Nazis

1599
01:02:33,768 --> 01:02:35,500
and I had to get a bottom half

1600
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:36,932
of a swastika
tattooed on me...

1601
01:02:36,934 --> 01:02:38,766
- Oh, my God.
- ...so they wouldn't kill me

1602
01:02:38,768 --> 01:02:40,766
and I didn't want that,

1603
01:02:40,768 --> 01:02:43,899
so I added little shoes and
I made him a little stick man

1604
01:02:43,901 --> 01:02:47,366
and I named him
Adolf Stickler.

1605
01:02:47,368 --> 01:02:49,433
You'd never know
he had little swastika legs.

1606
01:02:49,435 --> 01:02:50,899
- No.
- He's so happy about it.

1607
01:02:50,901 --> 01:02:51,966
I know, they just
look like pants.

1608
01:02:51,968 --> 01:02:54,599
You'd never know he was born
in the fires of hatred.

1609
01:02:54,601 --> 01:02:56,268
(LAUGHING)

1610
01:02:58,001 --> 01:02:59,801
Man, I am hungry.

1611
01:03:02,435 --> 01:03:03,932
What time is it?

1612
01:03:03,934 --> 01:03:06,601
I couldn't tell you
what fucking day it is.

1613
01:03:07,734 --> 01:03:10,699
And where...
Where are we right now?

1614
01:03:10,701 --> 01:03:11,999
I don't have a clue.

1615
01:03:12,001 --> 01:03:13,266
You don't know?

1616
01:03:13,268 --> 01:03:14,466
No. They just
dropped us here.

1617
01:03:14,468 --> 01:03:16,734
They just took us here
on the helicopter.

1618
01:03:38,801 --> 01:03:39,866
AGENT M: Good morning,
Mr. Flarsky.

1619
01:03:39,868 --> 01:03:41,235
Jesus!

1620
01:03:43,301 --> 01:03:44,634
You scared me, man.

1621
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:52,967
Could you maybe not tell
anybody about this?

1622
01:03:52,969 --> 01:03:54,768
They wouldn't
believe me anyway.

1623
01:03:56,402 --> 01:03:57,468
Fair enough.

1624
01:03:58,534 --> 01:03:59,869
Good luck, man.

1625
01:04:01,835 --> 01:04:02,902
Thank you.

1626

<i>One, two, three, four.</i>

1631
01:04:37,002 --> 01:04:38,900
I feel so happy right now!

1632
01:04:38,902 --> 01:04:40,633
Like,
I'm beginning to realize,

1633
01:04:40,635 --> 01:04:42,366
I may have never been happy.

1634
01:04:42,368 --> 01:04:44,867
This might be the first time
I ever felt happy.

1635
01:04:44,869 --> 01:04:46,333
And it feels good.

1636
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:49,333
This is like, the best shit
that's ever happened.

1637
01:04:49,335 --> 01:04:51,266
There's like this crazy big
banquet thing tonight,

1638
01:04:51,268 --> 01:04:52,867
and she gave me
like a tuxedo to wear.

1639
01:04:52,869 --> 01:04:53,933
And it's not like a date,

1640
01:04:53,935 --> 01:04:55,533
but it kinda
feels like a date.

1641

<i>How do I not fuck this up?
Seems impossible.</i>

1642
01:04:58,235 --> 01:05:00,466
Dude, you just need to give
yourself affirmation, man.

1643
01:05:00,468 --> 01:05:02,266
You need to... (STAMMERS)

1644
01:05:02,268 --> 01:05:04,335
You need to say that
you're worthy of love, man.

1645
01:05:05,301 --> 01:05:06,600
I am worthy of love.

1646
01:05:06,602 --> 01:05:08,266
<i>All right, now you gotta
say it 10,000</i>

1647
01:05:08,268 --> 01:05:09,767

until you believe it.

how to tie a bow tie.</i>

Hi.

1654
01:05:33,969 --> 01:05:36,633
You look really pretty.
(CHUCKLES)

1655
01:05:36,635 --> 01:05:37,869
Thank you.

1656
01:05:38,769 --> 01:05:41,833
You look really pretty, too.

1657
01:05:41,835 --> 01:05:42,900
Thank you.

1658
01:05:42,902 --> 01:05:44,334
Thanks for the suit.

1659
01:05:44,336 --> 01:05:45,466
We should probably head in.

1660
01:05:45,468 --> 01:05:46,568
- Shall we?
- FRED: Yeah.

1661
01:05:50,002 --> 01:05:52,767
Wow. This is awesome.

1662
01:05:52,769 --> 01:05:54,433
It's cool being
in Argentina.

1663
01:05:54,435 --> 01:05:55,833
I think the guys
who killed my grandparents

1664
01:05:55,835 --> 01:05:57,635
are hiding here somewhere.
(CHUCKLES)

1665
01:05:58,369 --> 01:05:59,468
Shit, they got a band.

1666
01:06:01,468 --> 01:06:04,900
Do you wanna, uh, dance maybe?
Or grab a drink?

1667
01:06:04,902 --> 01:06:06,433
So there are representatives

1668
01:06:06,435 --> 01:06:08,300
from over 75 countries
here tonight.

1669
01:06:08,302 --> 01:06:09,833
She has three hours
to get out there,

1670
01:06:09,835 --> 01:06:10,867
- shake her money maker...
- Yeah.

1671
01:06:10,869 --> 01:06:12,600
...and get as many
commitments as possible.

1672
01:06:12,602 --> 01:06:14,267
- This is a work event.
- Of course, yeah. I get it.

1673
01:06:14,269 --> 01:06:17,533
We could, uh, maybe at the end
of the night, have a drink.

1674
01:06:17,535 --> 01:06:19,667
Yeah, if you have time.
Cool.

1675
01:06:19,669 --> 01:06:21,733
- We'll see.
- Yeah.

1676
01:06:21,735 --> 01:06:23,535
All right. Okay.

1677
01:06:27,535 --> 01:06:28,869
I know what's going on.

1678
01:06:32,236 --> 01:06:34,667
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

1679
01:06:34,669 --> 01:06:35,733
There's nothing going on.

1680
01:06:35,735 --> 01:06:37,901
Don't fucking bullshit me,
Fred.

1681
01:06:37,903 --> 01:06:40,600
'Cause my EQ is through
the goddamn roof.

the nuances of social dynamics

like you wouldn't believe.

1684
01:06:44,635 --> 01:06:47,566
The two of you are having sex
with each other.

1685
01:06:47,568 --> 01:06:49,400
There's no way you could
discern something like that.

1686
01:06:49,402 --> 01:06:50,635
Charlotte told me.

1687
01:06:51,402 --> 01:06:52,334
Really?

1688
01:06:52,336 --> 01:06:54,400
No, but you just did,
you fucking idiot.

1689
01:06:54,402 --> 01:06:57,400
Fuck! Shit!
That was fucking very clever.

1690
01:06:57,402 --> 01:06:58,566
Jesus, well,
you know what, yes.

1691
01:06:58,568 --> 01:07:00,600
Okay. We're sexing
one another down.

1692
01:07:00,602 --> 01:07:01,500
- So?
- Ew.

1693
01:07:01,502 --> 01:07:02,868
Honestly, it's probably
weirder to me

1694
01:07:02,870 --> 01:07:04,001
- than it is to you.
- Look,

1695
01:07:04,003 --> 01:07:05,167
I can't believe
I have to say this,

1696
01:07:05,169 --> 01:07:08,402
but just so you know, there's
no way the two of you work.

1697
01:07:09,602 --> 01:07:11,333
Why would you say that?
You don't know that.

1698
01:07:11,335 --> 01:07:13,400
The public will never accept
the two of you together,

1699
01:07:13,402 --> 01:07:14,768
so neither will she.

1700
01:07:14,770 --> 01:07:16,366
Honestly, Fred,
it doesn't matter

1701
01:07:16,368 --> 01:07:17,333
if you get it or you don't,

1702
01:07:17,335 --> 01:07:19,001
'cause the truth is,
she is going to realize it

1703
01:07:19,003 --> 01:07:20,267
for the both of you,

1704
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:22,366
then you'll have
your heart broken.

1705
01:07:22,368 --> 01:07:23,701

kinda fun to watch.

I love you, man.

01:41:08,228 --> 01:41:11,226
But you're very judgmental.
They don't want politics

2414
01:41:11,228 --> 01:41:13,361

perspective, Fred.

2417
01:41:17,028 --> 01:41:18,461
- I know.
- It might explain

2418
01:41:18,463 --> 01:41:21,194
why you haven't been able to look
at this through Charlotte's eyes.

2419

I'm sorry.

"Fuck the polls"?

2434

Well, polls say that people
find my laugh unattractive.

2435
01:41:55,530 --> 01:41:57,328
So I shouldn't laugh
in public.
