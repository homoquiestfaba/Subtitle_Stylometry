1
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,100
(suspenseful music playing)

2
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,020
(suspenseful music continues)

3
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:04,000
(suspenseful music continues)

4
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,170
And if there's
anything you need to--

5
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:54,950
How do I get long distance
if I use my card?

6
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:58,030
Seven, one, area code
and number.

7
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,100
Do you want any lights?

8
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,930
(phone keys clicking)

9
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,000
You can do
your express check-out
with the TV,

10
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,010
-and if you want anything
from the mini-bar--
-Jerry.

11
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,010
Rocky Carleson.

12
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,120
Yeah, I made it on one piece,
but it was like flying on rocks.

13
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:12,970
Look,

14
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,090
I've never seen
this kind of heat

15
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,070
in all the years
I've been Bill Palmer's agent.

16
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,990
I'm telling you,
this is a marked change.

17
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,920
So listen...

18
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,100
I'm two meetings away
from seeing Bill,

19
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,150
I want to find out
if we are doing
any paperback business,

20
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,930
-so I can tell him...
-(suspenseful music plays)

21
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,930
(sirens blaring in distance)

22
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,160
(laughs) Yeah.

23
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,990
It could be meaningful.

24
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,010
What do I mean meaningful?
What do you think I mean?

25
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,020
I'm getting
picture offers already.

26
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,170
And we're only taking
a million five from your end

27
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,000
to start the conversation.

28
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,980
And then you own a property
that ties

29
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,160
into a fucking tailor-made
Michael Douglas vehicle.

30
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,940
It's just that
a fact's a fact, Jerry.

31
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,970
Other people know
they want the package,

32
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,960
I'm just thinking
of our prior relationship.

33
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,090
Exactly.

34
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,100
You work your number.
I'll call you in, uh...

35
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,940
three hours.

36
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,110
Good, good.

37
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,900
And trust me on this one.

38
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:09,950
I'm not bluffing.

39
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,050
(thud)

40
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,160
[anchorwoman] New today,
Bone Daddy,

41
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,950
latest page-turner
from Chicago's

42
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,080
master of the macabre,
William Palmer.

43
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,990
A man who, as residents
of the windy city will remember,

44
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,020
knows exactly
what he's talking about

45
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:38,030
when it comes to matters
of the no longer beating heart.

46
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,010
This is because his last day job

47
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:43,970
was as Chief Medical Examiner
of Chicago.

48
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:47,060
Chicagoans will recall
the real Bone Daddy
serial murder case

49
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,910
of seven years ago,

50
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,140
in which the perpetrator
was never caught.

51
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,970
In Palmer's new book,

52
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,910
he's written
a fictionalized account

53
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,050
in which the killer is caught.

54
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:02,020
While in Chicago,
Palmer won headlines galore

55
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,170
and notoriety
among criminologists

56
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,980
for cracking
any number of famous

57
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,070
and complex murder cases.

58
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,930
So like his others,

59
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,090
this latest book will, no doubt,

60
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:15,060
crackle
with nail-biting intensity.

61
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,920
For Chicago Today,
I'm Marilyn Chalmers.

62
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:24,110
(seagulls squawking)

63
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,170
(traffic buzzing)

64
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,080
(indistinct chatter)

65
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,030
(soft music playing)

66
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,970
-I even spelled it right.
-Thank you.

67
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,150
It's to Patti.

68
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,010
Excuse me, excuse me, folks,
excuse me.

69
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,180
Excuse me, thank you.

70
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,970
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen,

71
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,180
that's all the time Dr. Palmer
has for today.

72
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,150
Sorry to disappoint,
but if I don't get him
to his next appointment on time,

73
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,020
I'll lose my job.

74
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:37,970
You have 40 minutes.

75
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,920
I can't be late
for Peter's party.

76
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,160
Where's Rocky?

77
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,910
Quit worrying. Hi. Hi.

78
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,010
I need to talk to him.

79
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,080
Sorry.

80
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,980
-Everything is under control.
-You sure?

81
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,970
I'm sure. That's how P.R. people
keep their job.

82
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,910
We make sure
before you even think of it.

83
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,960
I thought it was by doing P.R.

84
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,140
That is P.R.

85
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,910
[man] I'll try Rocky again.

86
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,180
[Bill] Can I tell you a secret?

87
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,990
[man] You don't have to.
I already know.

88
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,140
Hi, Rocky Carleson, please,
room 878.

89
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,970
You're nervous having your kid
one jump away from your old job.

90
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,990
You know what, you could
really piss a person off.

91
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,920
[man] It's busy again.

92
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,140
We'll pick him up on the way.

93
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,010
(horns honking)

94
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,110
[Bill] Rocky? (clears throat)
Are you in there?

95
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,180
Nobody in here but me.

96
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,940
Wasn't nobody here
when I came either.

97
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:40,120
I'm sorry, Donna, is it?
Can we look inside?

98
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,120
-Thanks a lot.
-(phone beeping)

99
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,070
[Bill] No wonder it was busy.

100
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,110
(phone clicks)

101
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,940
Phone is off the damn hook.

102
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:48,950
Rocky?

103
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,940
[man] Nice room.

104
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,920
Yeah, there's his bag.

105
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,090
I'm really not supposed
to let you in here

106
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,150
if it's not your room.

107
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,940
It's so unlike him.

108
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,070
-(bin clatters)
-[Donna] Don't know
how that happened.

109
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,930
Never happened before.

110
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:05,970
But, you know,
room service chicken's
awful popular.

111
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,130
Thank you, Donna.

112
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,920
(suspenseful music playing)

113
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:30,990
Middle finger.

114
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,060
Left hand.

115
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,030
(siren wailing)

116
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,910
[man 1] What if the Bone Daddy
could be back?

117
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,170
To tell you the truth,

118
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,110
I started to worry
when I heard the goddamn title.

119
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,130
What's that supposed to mean?

120
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,930
You took a huge risk
and you know it.

121
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,900
Could it be a P.R. stunt?

122
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,080
That's completely insulting.

123
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,020
[man 2] How about a fan
paying homage?

124
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,060
My agent may be in danger,

125
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,050
you've got to let me in on this.

126
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,960
-You've been out of it too long.
-Nonsense.

127
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,920
You're also still
pretty fucking arrogant.

128
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,910
Which is one
of his better traits.

129
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,090
[Bill] We were both
on this case before.

130
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,940
I know this man.

131
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:24,990
And so do you.

132
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,940
All right.

133
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,990
I'll let you work with Hewlett.

134
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,920
-Chief.
-She's the cop.

135
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,920
You're the consultant.

136
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,080
Consultant.

137
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,050
Do you understand?

138
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,990
Now, don't you have
a party to get to?

139
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,030
They probably told you
what a grouch I was?

140
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,920
Didn't really do you justice.

141
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,110
Spoken like a badge.

142
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,920
How does a badge sound?

143
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,100
Depends.

144
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,910
Some of your colleagues
used to have problems with me.

145
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,110
They called you
Dr. Frankenstein.

146
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,150
That is correct.

147
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,930
Well, at least he was smart.

148
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,070
[Bill] They tell you
to flatter me?

149
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,940
[Sharon] Yeah,
but I didn't pay attention.

150
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:26,110
I know this is all a bit sudden,

151
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,180
and it's probably not the job
you've been dreaming of.

152
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:31,110
But since you're so brilliant,
I'm supposed to take you
seriously, right?

153
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:33,000
That would be good.

154
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,100
I have an ex-husband
with that attitude.

155
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,940
[Bill] Marriage is hard.

156
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,100
Especially for cops.

157
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,950
Yeah, it was hard all around.

158
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,190
Any children?

159
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,980
-No.
-You didn't want them?

160
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:48,150
Excuse me.

161
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,930
Just trying to find out
who I am working with.

162
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:56,950
Look, it may come
as a surprise to you,

163
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,100
but I've done this before.

164
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,930
I don't like
your defensive attitude.

165
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,020
It doesn't mean
that you're offended,

166
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,950
it means you are insecure.

167
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,940
You can't afford that
on this case.

168
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,140
You hesitate, you lose.

169
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,980
-(door opens)
-(gravel crunching)

170
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,920
(orchestral music playing)

171
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:32,030
(indistinct chatter)

172
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:39,190
(music stops)

173
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,140
Ladies, gentlemen,
I'd like to...

174
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,920
uh, propose a toast to the man

175
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,190
that we are here
to congratulate tonight,

176
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,980
-Peter Palmer.
-[guests] Hear, hear!

177
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,090
(all applaud)

178
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,170
Now, Peter is the kind of man

179
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:57,970
who will elevate
the medical examiner's office

180
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:00,010
in this city to better things.

181
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:02,160
And just like his father,

182
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,090
my very good friend,
Bill Palmer,

183
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,130
just like Bill,

184
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:10,030
Peter will make
a great contribution

185
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,170
and I wouldn't be surprised
one day to hand my job
over to him.

186
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:14,180
-(guests laugh)
-Watch it.

187
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:17,910
'Cause I could do that
with complete trust

188
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,030
and confidence.

189
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,910
Ladies and gentlemen,
Peter Palmer.

190
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,120
[all] To Peter!

191
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,070
-(guests applauding)
-Thank you very much.

192
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,170
(dog barking in distance)

193
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,120
[butler] Mr. Palmer Sr.
just arrived.

194
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,950
Bill!

195
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:00,050
You had us watching
the clock there, buddy.

196
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,900
There was a bit of a delay.
I'm sure you've heard.

197
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,900
(softly) Yeah, I know,
I got the call.
Are you all right?

198
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,910
I'm fine.

199
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,910
Oh, excuse me, this is...

200
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,060
Detective Sharon Hewlett.

201
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,100
Marshall Stone.

202
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,170
Here I thought
she was just another

203
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:13,060
naive, misguided girl.

204
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,900
Listen, I've got guests, uh...

205
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,940
Peter's in there.

206
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,970
(indistinct chatter)

207
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,930
-[Bill] Peter.
-Hi.

208
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,140
Congratulations.

209
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,070
I'm sorry I'm late.

210
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:37,140
It's okay, he has been
quite busy with all of this.

211
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,920
When you get the job,
you get the job.

212
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,140
That's probably why
they decided to have the party

213
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,050
at the boss's house, right?

214
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,940
You know,
you've made your appearance.

215
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,040
You don't have to hang around
if you're not in the mood.

216
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,000
Photographer needs you
by the cake, champ.

217
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,010
Sorry.

218
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,140
When you get the job,
you get the cake.

219
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,020
The kids said to say hi.

220
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,160
Thank you.

221
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,060
(sighs)

222
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,050
You're obviously
very proud of him.

223
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:09,920
Yes.

224
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,150
I always knew he'd do well.

225
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,960
Did you have
anything to do with it?

226
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,990
Get a close-up of the cake.

227
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,160
Get a really nice one
of the cake.

228
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,940
-Dr. Palmer.
-Trent!

229
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,930
How have you been?

230
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,910
You're looking
like a million bucks.

231
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:38,970
Looks deceive. Still making
Y cuts for chump-change.

232
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,150
How's my kid doing?

233
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,080
He inherited the talent.

234
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,170
Keep an eye on him?

235
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,910
Count on it.

236
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,160
[woman] Bill.

237
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,930
I came to share
in the glory too.

238
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:58,010
That must be because
you're his mother.

239
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,080
Must be.

240
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:03,970
Who's the brunette?

241
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:05,940
Come on.

242
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,140
-How are you?
-Excellent.

243
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,000
Don't tell me.

244
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,060
I won't.

245
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,190
It's a shame
you missed the toast.

246
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:17,910
-We waited as long as we could.
-Is this from you, Trent?

247
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,010
You know what a ham
Marshall Stone is.

248
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:28,010
[Peter] Oh, they're great.

249
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,110
(sighs)

250
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,080
Look at him.

251
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:37,030
I have just realized,
he's not a kid anymore.

252
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,020
I had always hoped

253
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,920
his life wouldn't be
quite so involved with death.

254
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,970
He's not involved with death.

255
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,070
He serves life,

256
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:51,120
because he studies
the end of it.

257
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,120
Ah...

258
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,960
-You're as good as ever.
-Don't.

259
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,960
Never better.

260
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,910
Never covers a lot of ground.

261
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,090
Ex-wife?

262
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,070
Yes.

263
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,140
Twelve years.

264
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:18,020
Look, um, I didn't mean
to insult you before,

265
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,920
when I made that comment
about helping Peter get his job.

266
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,920
All right.

267
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,900
He didn't want my help. I tried.

268
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,170
[Peter] Jesus Christ!

269
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,080
[woman] Oh, my God...

270
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,970
(gasps) Oh! Oh!

271
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,050
[Stone] No one touch it.

272
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:47,140
(dramatic music playing)

273
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,990
I think this is for you.

274
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,040
Damn it!

275
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,990
(eerie music playing)

276
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:49,980
[Trent] Dr. Palmer?

277
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,140
You were right.

278
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,990
They are all
from the same victim.

279
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,990
Sorry.

280
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:58,920
Run hair and fiber inside
and outside the boxes,

281
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,990
wrapping paper, bows,
the whole thing.

282
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,970
You'll find fingerprints

283
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,190
from the people
who handled the boxes,

284
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:07,950
nothing else.

285
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,120
Still has to be done, Dad.

286
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,180
If you have a coherent profile,
Doctor,

287
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,180
-please don't sit on it.
-I don't.

288
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,110
Then why don't you just let her
do her job?

289
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,180
Don't apologize for me.

290
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:25,040
I think you should apologize
for yourself.

291
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:29,170
Do you think I've lost
my people skills?

292
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:31,130
You never had people skills.

293
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,150
You had rank.

294
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:36,950
All right.

295
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:40,000
I think,
you might wanna see this, Bill.

296
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,090
I'll take that.

297
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:42,930
[Sharon] What is it?

298
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,190
None of the bones
came from the cadaver.

299
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,170
Which means?

300
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,920
It means...

301
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,180
this is being done...

302
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,940
to him, alive.

303
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:05,110
(creaking)

304
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:19,120
(footsteps approaching)

305
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,950
(Rocky breathing erratically)

306
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,160
(panting)

307
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,970
(door clicks)

308
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:51,930
(cracks)

309
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,900
(wincing)

310
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,170
(thuds)

311
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,910
(screaming) No!

312
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:43,000
(grunting)

313
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:51,980
(metal clanks in distance)

314
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,920
(suspenseful music playing)

315
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,980
(train horn blares)

316
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,120
Bill! Bill.

317
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:28,150
This morning's paper,
have you seen it?

318
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:30,170
-It's everywhere,
we can't ignore it.
-[Bill] Oh, boy.

319
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:34,150
You better go to work.
I don't know how to handle this.

320
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,950
Don't worry,
I'll make it sell books.

321
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,930
Holy moley, this way.

322
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:39,120
(reporters yelling indistinctly)

323
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,030
Do you think it showed good
judgment to put a story

324
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,140
and an idea like that out there?

325
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,150
[reporter] What do you think?

326
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,190
Don't say anything.

327
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,020
I've got an idea.

328
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,110
You know what you ought to do?
Read your own newspaper.

329
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:56,070
Then ask your editor
the same question.

330
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,930
Okay, sorry, we gotta run.

331
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:59,970
(reporters yelling indistinctly)

332
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:04,190
I've got a statement,
folks, I've got a statement.

333
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:06,110
Come on back this way,
come on back this way.

334
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:08,110
Hey, Frank, how are you,
it's good to see you.

335
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,020
Come on back this way,
folks, I've got a statement.

336
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:15,090
All right? You ready? Rolling?
All right.

337
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:17,030
First of all,
there is no conclusive evidence

338
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,000
to indicate that this
is the original Bone Daddy.

339
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,010
Or even anyone responding
to the book.

340
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:22,140
-(cameras clicking)
-All it does is verify

341
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:25,030
Bill Palmer's unmatched mastery
of profiling,

342
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,140
and his unerring sense
of human behavioral patterns.

343
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:29,090
-Okay? Thanks very much.
-(reporters groan)

344
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:31,070
(indistinct chatter continues)

345
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,130
(suspenseful music playing)

346
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:08,170
(suspenseful music continues)

347
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,940
He's raising the stakes.

348
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:24,040
What he did before
was pretty intense.

349
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,930
The earlier victims
had nothing in common.

350
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,170
This is different,
it's a response.

351
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,140
And he isn't finished.

352
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:38,120
I'm gonna have to bring in
these suspects again.

353
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:40,140
Of course, after seven years,
half of them

354
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,960
will have moved out of town.

355
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:44,190
I wanted to ask you about
this guys, Dr. Morton Franz.

356
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:48,140
[Bill] Assistant Chief
Medical Examiner at the time.

357
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:53,900
You had your own people
under suspicion?

358
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,030
[Bill] The killer
was a sophisticated man.

359
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:58,060
We suspected everybody
and his brother.

360
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,040
The evidence just wasn't there.

361
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:04,020
But the killer
in the book was an M.E.

362
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,030
Yes...

363
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,160
Like Morton Franz.

364
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,120
Like fiction.

365
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,170
Like you.

366
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,080
No.

367
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,990
Nothing like me.

368
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,070
Franz was Bill's main rival
for the chief M.E. job.

369
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,920
Was there any other reason
he was a suspect?

370
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,160
Well, being a rival,
that wasn't a reason,

371
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,170
but certainly, it didn't help.

372
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,080
Now...

373
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:42,050
this is the pelvis

374
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:44,910
of a young girl, probably...

375
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,170
Lisa Hollingsworth.

376
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,090
Never found.

377
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:52,080
To tell the truth,

378
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,920
Franz was a lousy M.E.,

379
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,970
and his only hope
was administration.

380
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,060
So when he lost out, he...

381
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:01,120
He hated Bill's guts.

382
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,940
This is a rib of a man
in his 70s. Probably...

383
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,000
Stanley Chase.

384
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:12,140
And then of course, there was...
the affair.

385
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:15,010
Affair? What affair?

386
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,190
Franz's wife.

387
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,010
Palmer?

388
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:21,910
Tibias.

389
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,140
We were lousy with tibias.

390
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,060
We figured he liked them.

391
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,920
[Sharon] Were any whole victims
ever found?

392
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:33,090
Never. Every bone we got,
he sent to us.

393
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:36,970
All in the same condition
as these recent ones.

394
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,060
With the exception
of the messages

395
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,190
cut out of Bill's novel.

396
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:43,950
So, was Franz still working here
at the time he was the suspect?

397
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,950
One week after

398
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,190
Bill took the Chief M.E. job,

399
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,140
he had to fire Franz.

400
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,190
Why?

401
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,010
Professional differences.

402
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,110
And Bone Daddy?

403
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,110
The first bone
was two weeks later.

404
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:04,140
(intense music playing)

405
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,180
(phone ringing)

406
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,090
-Hello?
-[Cobb] Hewlett?

407
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:26,910
How come you're opening
the Franz file? Something new?

408
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:30,040
Not really,
but he is a viable suspect.

409
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,000
Okay, we all read the book.

410
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,930
Palmer based the character
on Morton Franz,

411
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:35,010
and if I were him,
I'd sue his ass,

412
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:37,170
but the book is not the case.

413
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:39,010
It's not just the book,

414
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:40,110
it's the affair.

415
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:42,990
It could be payback.
It's a hell of a motive.

416
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:45,910
There wasn't anything then,
there isn't now.

417
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:47,900
[Sharon] That's not
what Stone thinks.

418
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:51,060
When Palmer or Stone become
Chief of Police,

419
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,010
I'll shut up
and defer to their opinion.

420
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:55,980
But till then,
count less on life imitating art

421
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,030
and more on hard evidence.

422
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,170
(dial tone)

423
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,080
-(sighs)
-(phone clicks)

424
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:10,030
(car engine starts)

425
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:12,910
(eerie music playing)

426
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,900
(car revs)

427
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,960
[Cindy] Shotgun, shotgun.

428
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,180
[Mark] You got shotgun
last time.

429
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:36,160
Mommy, look.

430
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:40,040
(softly) Oh, no...
Leave it alone, Mark.

431
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,160
Come inside the house,
now, kids.

432
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,930
[Mark] What is it, Mommy?

433
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,000
Just come inside
the house, now, kids.

434
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,020
-[Mark] Maybe a dog left it.
-Get away from it.

435
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:48,140
Get away. Come on, in the house.

436
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,060
(eerie music playing)

437
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:00,160
(indistinct chatter
on police radio)

438
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:07,110
(indistinct chatter)

439
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,960
What's he telling us?

440
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,190
That we'll never catch him.

441
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:33,160
He used to be
a classic impersonal killer.

442
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:35,020
Meaning?

443
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,950
He doesn't wanna
know his victims,

444
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:40,080
so he doesn't feel bad
when he kills them.

445
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,070
This victim's still alive.

446
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:45,000
(softly) Let's hope so.

447
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:47,980
Could be a copycat.

448
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,190
No.

449
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,180
It's the same man
trying to convince me

450
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,080
he's a genius.

451
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,060
(indistinct police chatter)

452
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,090
(chatter over radio)

453
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:11,940
(water flowing)

454
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:18,090
This isn't a cross-examination,
Mr. Baxter,

455
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:20,940
so can you give us a hint?

456
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,140
Are these samples any good?
Are they all jack?

457
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,930
Pressure does not
improve evidence.

458
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:28,990
Excuse me, you think
this is pressure?

459
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,140
Look...

460
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:35,130
Do you even understand
soil sample search?

461
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:38,920
Sure, when I can get
my breasts out of the way,
I read quite a bit.

462
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:44,150
You got your little case,
with your limited facts,

463
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:46,920
I've got the world
to cross reference.

464
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,130
It could be evidence from
where the person was dragged,

465
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:51,180
where the attack occurred,
any number of places.

466
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,970
I'm not even talkin' hair yet.

467
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:55,960
-What about fiber?
-Fiber...

468
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:58,970
is interesting.

469
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:02,050
They had some on the outside
of the wrapping papers.

470
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:05,100
Different wrappings.

471
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,120
And different manufacturers.

472
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:11,940
The shin was
Charleston Gift Press
metallic finish,

473
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:16,030
ankle and foot,
standard Barton-Dunne
ultra-weave decorative.

474
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:18,060
Same on both.

475
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,090
[Baxter] Exactly.

476
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,980
Any ideas?

477
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:26,030
Look, I, I don't deal in ideas.

478
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:27,900
I'm an empiricist.

479
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,020
The data's determined,
I reach a conclusion
based on it.

480
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:33,140
Which could be
absolutely meaningless.

481
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,160
True.

482
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:37,040
Thank you.

483
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,120
Asshole.

484
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,060
(scoffs)

485
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:48,960
With internal examination
complete, we will now close.

486
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:54,980
Whatever differences we have,
I'd like you to make
some arrangements.

487
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:59,020
You quit buying my lunch
a long time ago, dad.

488
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:01,060
Just protect your family.

489
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,180
I'm well aware of that.

490
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,130
Why do you do it like that?

491
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:15,960
It's how I do it!

492
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:18,090
It's not the right stitch.

493
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:20,950
(Peter scoffs)

494
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,940
It's the one I've used
on hundreds of cadavers

495
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,930
inside and out
and I've never had a problem.

496
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:27,960
What's she gonna do?
Shake it off? Huh?

497
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:31,040
What are you mad about?

498
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:34,040
All right.

499
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:37,100
I'm mad because
in my entire life

500
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,130
you've never shown
a shit's worth of interest

501
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:40,160
in a damn thing I've done.

502
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:43,180
But now that
you finally acknowledge

503
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,030
that I am
a forensic pathologist,

504
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:47,930
that I actually make a living
at it like you did,

505
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:49,170
of course, you don't think
I do it right.

506
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:51,080
You pick apart
my fucking stitches.

507
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,060
I'm concerned.

508
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,150
It's just I never had it before,

509
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:57,900
I don't think I suddenly
want your quality time now.

510
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,060
Peter, I understand.

511
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,020
And protecting my family!

512
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:05,020
Where the hell did you get off

513
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:07,100
telling me about protecting
my family?

514
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,170
Huh?

515
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:10,960
You dragged my mother
through shit!

516
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,060
You couldn't protect
your own family!

517
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,980
But now what?
You wanna give me advice?

518
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:20,030
You're still my son.

519
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:22,960
You keep your fucking hands off.

520
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:28,080
(intense music playing)

521
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,150
All right.

522
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,190
(door shuts)

523
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:51,920
(traffic buzzing)

524
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,090
(indistinct chatter)

525
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:10,130
Good men don't play
against themselves.

526
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,130
-You have time?
-For you? Two minutes.

527
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:24,160
(timer clicking)

528
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,180
Tell me, Marshall.

529
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,960
When did I become
stupid enough to write
the damned book?

530
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,050
Come on, you had to write it.
Don't be so hard on yourself.

531
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,920
I was selfish.

532
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:53,140
Facin' the truth...

533
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,080
is always risky.

534
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,020
It wasn't as noble as that.

535
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,920
Why? Because you saw you were
making money out of it?

536
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,090
What's the big deal?

537
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,070
Because I was willing
to let it make money.

538
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:13,090
Oh, what the hell?
Give the money to charity.

539
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:16,090
I sold out.

540
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:20,080
I put people in danger.

541
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:23,960
Really you're being too hard
on yourself.

542
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,020
Don't act crazy.

543
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:27,190
And you're ruining your game.

544
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,940
I'm ruining my life.

545
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:38,000
Hmm.

546
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,040
Unfortunately, Rocky's paying
a very personal price

547
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,930
for what you had to do.

548
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:45,040
And you have to live with it.

549
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,990
But then again, you always
have to live with something.

550
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:48,920
Time's up.

551
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:52,940
(dramatic music playing)

552
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,160
Hewlett?

553
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,170
Anything new?

554
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:18,040
Maybe.

555
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:22,970
I'm, uh, thinking about
some more non-Franz candidates

556
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,050
just to cover our butts.

557
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,050
Thinking? That's a good way
of using the taxpayers' money.

558
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,080
There are a few people

559
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,100
who have all
the technical qualifications.

560
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,130
Butcher.

561
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,950
Plastic surgeon.

562
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,090
Assistant medical examiner.

563
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:44,940
He very possibly has a motive.

564
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:47,100
Well, that's a great idea.

565
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:51,110
Neglected by
an overpowering father...

566
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:54,180
watched his mother in pain
while she was cheating on--

567
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,960
I know the story
better than you.

568
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:00,080
I know the part about how
he wet his bed until he was 13.

569
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,150
How he had a fascination
for fires.

570
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:06,940
Two of the traits the experts
seem to think that
most serial killers have.

571
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:10,070
Not to mention, millions of kids
who wouldn't hurt a fly.

572
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:14,060
Looks like you know Peter
very well.

573
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,010
(sighs) Okay, look...

574
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,150
Maybe he hated his dad.
God knows I hated mine.

575
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:25,990
But I didn't go carving bones
out of anybody.

576
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,190
Jesus!

577
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:32,180
I'd love to be there
when you tell Palmer
you're investigating Peter.

578
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,960
Wear a helmet.

579
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,030
(sighs)

580
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:45,160
(intense music playing)

581
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,090
(dramatic music playing)

582
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:35,900
(phone ringing)

583
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:38,000
(door opens)

584
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,010
(phone ringing)

585
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,190
(breathes heavily)

586
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,070
Bill Palmer.

587
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:49,080
Hello?

588
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,970
Hello!

589
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,040
(answering machine rewinds)

590
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,060
(phone beeps)

591
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,900
[Peter] Dad.

592
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:03,960
This is Peter.

593
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:07,970
[Peter sighs] We have to talk.

594
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:11,950
But not on your machine.
I think I really need to
explain some things...

595
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:14,130
and I know you do.

596
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,090
I just...

597
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:20,990
I don't think we can keep
butting heads like this

598
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:24,180
and I'm not about
to just suck it up again.

599
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,150
I will not suck it up again.

600
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:29,940
So, uh...

601
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,960
All right, call me back,
or I'll call you.

602
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:34,010
Bye.

603
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:35,080
(phone beeps)

604
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,120
(phone rings)

605
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,130
-Peter!
-[man] (distorted voice)
Still awake?

606
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:51,020
(dramatic music playing)

607
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:54,930
Uh, should I know
what this is about?

608
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:56,150
Do you want me to hang up?

609
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:59,900
Um, no.

610
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,170
(intense music playing)

611
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,010
I thought you might
want to talk.

612
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:09,010
Of course.

613
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:13,040
Sure, of course, I do.

614
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,920
You killed Rocky, didn't you?

615
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:21,000
Why?

616
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,110
He doesn't mean anything to you.

617
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:25,960
Ah, you don't understand,
do you?

618
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:29,030
(chuckles softly) No.

619
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:32,160
So why don't you tell me?

620
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:35,050
What's the point?

621
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:37,110
It's your point.

622
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,990
You started this.

623
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:42,180
So how do I end it?

624
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:45,190
Surely somebody
as literary as you

625
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:48,020
must know about sleeping dogs.

626
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:50,980
Look, if this is
about you and me,

627
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:54,900
why don't we meet somewhere
face to face?

628
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,170
It sounds like you're offering
to suck my cock, Bill.

629
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,910
Are you offering
to suck my cock, Bill?

630
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:06,050
-I know you, don't I?
-  You are going
to see how naive you are.

631
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:10,010
Because it's gonna get
much harder to deal with
when it's the girl.

632
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:12,160
-What girl?
-You'd hate to have her think

633
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,050
that you're a fool.

634
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:17,120
You'd eat a yard of shit
to see where it came from.

635
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:20,910
-What are you talkin about?
-What's she gonna think of you?

636
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:23,190
What's she gonna think when
I'm working and she's screaming

637
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:26,020
and she's wondering
where the hell you are?

638
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:28,010
What's the cop gonna think?

639
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:31,960
(intense music playing)

640
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,070
(clock ticking)

641
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:05,900
(oven beeping)

642
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,010
(cat yowling)

643
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:36,040
(thunder rumbling)

644
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,910
(cat yowling)

645
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:43,930
Never let me down
when the food's hot,
do you, Oliver?

646
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:50,150
(bells chiming)

647
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:58,120
(cat yowling)

648
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:02,900
(intense music playing)

649
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:04,140
Oliver!

650
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,960
Come on, kitty.

651
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:11,030
(cat yowling)

652
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:12,190
(line ringing)

653
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:15,150
(phone ringing)

654
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:18,160
Come on! Come on!

655
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:20,980
Jesus.

656
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,950
(thunder rumbling)

657
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:29,150
Come on, kitty.

658
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:31,180
Come on.

659
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,110
(cat whimpering)

660
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:47,920
-(cat meowing)
-(thunder rumbling)

661
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:48,970
(screams)

662
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:51,920
-(intense music playing)
-(tires screeching)

663
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:10,040
(gasps)

664
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:16,120
Sharon?

665
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:19,040
(Sharon gasps)

666
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,910
(Sharon screams)

667
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:26,020
(intense music playing)

668
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,080
-Sharon!
-(panting)

669
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:53,110
Get up.

670
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:54,140
Come on.

671
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:55,170
It's all right.

672
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,120
Come on.

673
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:04,060
(intense music playing)

674
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:26,020
(muffled voices)

675
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:38,150
(intense music continues)

676
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:51,030
(muffled voices)

677
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:06,040
(muffled voices)

678
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:27,110
(siren blaring in distance)

679
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:41,190
[Bill] Peter?

680
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,990
Call me, please.

681
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:15,940
I'm telling you, I'm fine.

682
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:18,120
I don't need this.

683
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,990
Detective,
we've been down this road
on your judgment before.

684
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:23,970
You know damn well
that's unfair.

685
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:25,970
I'm not sure I do.

686
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:28,120
I gave you some rope once
even though I shouldn't have.

687
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:29,900
-And you hung yourself!
-Look!

688
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:31,900
If you're telling me
you want me off the case,

689
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:32,990
then just say so!

690
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:35,010
But don't insult me
by telling me

691
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:37,070
you want me to take a breather
for a couple of days.

692
00:47:37,070 --> 00:47:38,910
You have been mentioned.

693
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:40,960
Probably by the killer,
as a possible victim.

694
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,130
I'm a cop!

695
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:44,100
Does that mean
I'm supposed to go away?

696
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:46,170
No, you're a cop,
you're supposed to do
what I tell you to do.

697
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:49,090
You're supposed to be
off this case.
I don't want you involved.

698
00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:51,010
(indistinct yelling)

699
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:54,130
I wouldn't.

700
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:56,030
Problems?

701
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:58,940
-[Cobb] And you're in danger.
-Not your fight.

702
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:07,930
His voice is on here.

703
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:16,110
(sighs)

704
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:34,970
-All right?
-What?

705
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:50,950
What was that about?

706
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,130
Cobb wants me off the case.

707
00:48:58,070 --> 00:48:59,080
Why?

708
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:03,020
(sighs) For old times' sake.

709
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:06,920
I guess he doesn't believe
I've learned anything

710
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,150
all the years
I've done this job.

711
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:16,040
I was married
when I joined the force,

712
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:20,900
and I, uh, I got pregnant
sooner than we had planned.

713
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:23,000
You know, it wasn't like
I-I lied to him or anything,

714
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,060
I told Cobb right away,
and I begged him to let me
stay on the field.

715
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:30,130
(sighs) My husband, you know,
was givin' me shit
every night saying,

716
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:31,980
"Whoa, what if
something happens?"

717
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:35,070
You know, "What if we have
to see a doctor?" And just...

718
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:37,990
You don't wanna hear that,
you know? (chuckles softly)

719
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:39,150
And then, I, um...

720
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:42,170
I'm in this situation.

721
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:45,970
Turns into a chase,

722
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,170
and, uh, I won't wait
for backup.

723
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:51,050
You know, Miss Tough Guy.

724
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:56,090
And I go runnin'
and I come around this corner
and, uh...

725
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:59,080
the guy kicks me.

726
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:02,170
(mellow music playing)

727
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:06,160
And I, uh...

728
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:09,140
lost my baby.

729
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:13,000
(Sharon sniffles)

730
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:17,040
Lost my son because
I was an asshole.

731
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:23,110
'Cause I had to be a hero.

732
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,060
(Sharon sobs)

733
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:42,920
-(phone ringing)
-(indistinct chatter)

734
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:56,090
You are gonna love this.

735
00:50:56,090 --> 00:50:57,970
Okay.

736
00:50:57,970 --> 00:51:01,060
Wrapping paper.

737
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:04,980
This is the close-up of the back
of the paper that the ankle
and foot bones were wrapped in.

738
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:07,030
-Why the back?
-Well, look at the numbers.

739
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:11,010
Dye lot and production
run numbers at the end
of a roll, on the back.

740
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:13,070
Hmm.

741
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,130
Barton-Dunne shipping records
showing where a roll

742
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:17,930
with these numbers
would've been shipped.

743
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:20,090
I'll be damned.

744
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:24,050
It was sent exactly 150 miles

745
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:28,050
from where I'm standing
to lovely Bennington, Illinois,
where...

746
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:33,030
There are 15 Franz's
in the phone book.

747
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:39,040
I'm on my way.

748
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:51,030
[Sharon] "In the darkest bottom
of the fearful, outraged,
damaged thing,

749
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:55,950
"that was his heart, Bone Daddy
lived for the feeling of
the Big Moment.

750
00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:58,060
"The feeling of the cut,
the give

751
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:00,000
"the hot splash.

752
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,920
"He gave this feeling a name.

753
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,910
"He called it Kill Sport.

754
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:08,940
"He could only unloose
the terrible, coiled thing
inside him

755
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:12,090
"when he drove deep
through muscle,
when he hit bone.

756
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:15,020
"Broke bone, cut cartilage.

757
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:20,980
"He stood before his mirror
knowing he must go again
and again and again.

758
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:23,990
"And he saw
no squalid reptile brow.

759
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:26,990
"He recognized
no blown-circuit eyes.

760
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:30,010
"He beheld instead,
the mightiest purity."

761
00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:37,900
What in the world would a writer
want to accomplish
with something like this?

762
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:39,020
It's fiction.

763
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:42,160
Based on certain true events.

764
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,140
But one of those events
is now a sicko,

765
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:48,190
out there on the loose,
responding to what you wrote.

766
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:54,070
I... When I write, it comes
from all kinds of places,

767
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:57,030
all kinds of people,
different experiences.

768
00:52:57,030 --> 00:52:58,140
This is seven years ago.

769
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:02,110
But don't you feel
in any way responsible

770
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:05,010
for what happens
because of your fiction?

771
00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:07,920
Obviously you think I am.

772
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:10,130
As a writer,

773
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:13,020
the truth is
what I want it to be.

774
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,130
There is no real truth.

775
00:53:16,050 --> 00:53:17,160
There's only interpretation.

776
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:21,940
But you give this guy no choice.

777
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:23,950
(stammers)
He has to strike back.

778
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:27,040
I mean, you're walkin'
on his turf.
You've edged him out.

779
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,130
If I were him,
if I were the killer,

780
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,910
and I read what you wrote,
I'd go ape-shit.

781
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:34,990
(chuckles)

782
00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:38,910
I'm sorry,
if you were the killer...

783
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:43,100
-I'd be very nervous.
-(chuckles)

784
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:45,110
And I wouldn't be sitting here
talking to you.

785
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:56,080
-So tell me about Franz.
-Franz?

786
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:03,960
He was into mathematics.

787
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:08,010
He was a computer whiz,
he was a good man,

788
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:10,980
but he had way too many things
on his plate.

789
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:13,100
He was also a hell of a drinker.

790
00:54:15,070 --> 00:54:16,140
What about his wife?

791
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:23,060
I've been waiting
for that question.

792
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:26,090
She was...

793
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:29,090
wonderful, mad,

794
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,900
sexy, bright.

795
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:35,090
Were you close?

796
00:54:35,090 --> 00:54:36,190
We used to have this group,

797
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:39,940
this elite group, we'd come here

798
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:42,900
during our night shift
with our cell phones
and our beepers.

799
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:46,910
We'd have discussions,
play fast games of chess,

800
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:50,130
and then, Carol and Franz
would pop in...

801
00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:54,980
and he would get
very drunk, very fast.

802
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:58,130
And she would play chess
with us.

803
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:01,110
And win.

804
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:04,010
Hey, she beat all of us
at one time or another.

805
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:09,150
And then what happened?

806
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:15,150
You know what,
you ask too many questions.

807
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,030
You get the job,
you ask the questions.

808
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:24,970
Well...

809
00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:27,170
Hey, there he is.

810
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:32,140
Oh, wait, now. You don't look
as relaxed as I told you to be.

811
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:34,950
He look relaxed to you?

812
00:55:36,110 --> 00:55:39,110
Phil, you need to help me.

813
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,180
I need to get my book pulled.

814
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:47,020
(sighs) Bill...

815
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:51,070
The book is in every book store
and the half the supermarkets
across America.

816
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:55,040
You can't pull a ship back
into port when it's going
the opposite way.

817
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:58,970
It's the best opening title
this year. They're getting
incredible feedback.

818
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:02,000
Tell him I'll sue.

819
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,990
Well, have I ever been able to
stop you from doing
what you wanna do? Hmm?

820
00:56:09,910 --> 00:56:11,140
I'm sure they'll tell you
to go ahead.

821
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:14,150
And I'm not an agent
or anything,
but you do have a contract.

822
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:16,100
You wrote the thing,
and they spent
all kinds of money

823
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:18,940
to print it, advertise it
and supply the retailers.

824
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:20,130
So you can kick and scream
all you want,

825
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:22,960
but you don't have a fucking leg
to stand on in the real world,

826
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,090
and you know it!
And I can't help you.

827
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:30,180
Phil...

828
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:34,020
Can I talk to you for a second?

829
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:36,000
What?

830
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,130
You heard me.

831
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,110
Phil...

832
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:49,910
you're fired.
Put a spin on that.

833
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:57,090
I hate writers.

834
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:06,140
(traffic buzzing)

835
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,140
(wheels rolling)

836
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:12,080
(keyboard keys clacking)

837
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:15,960
Okay, let's try it.

838
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:20,940
[man] (distorted voice) You are
going to see how naive you are.

839
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:23,090
Because it's gonna get
much harder to deal with

840
00:57:23,090 --> 00:57:25,920
when it's the girl.

841
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,900
You'd hate to have her think
that you're a fool.

842
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:30,010
You'd eat a yard of shit...

843
00:57:30,010 --> 00:57:32,040
It doesn't sound
any different to me.

844
00:57:33,010 --> 00:57:35,180
It sounds completely different.

845
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:37,170
Help us here, son.
We're not trained,

846
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:39,900
so we're not just quite hearing
what you're hearing.

847
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:44,020
Right now, I've taken about half
the high-end multi-dupe
simul-masking out.

848
00:57:46,110 --> 00:57:48,140
(sighs) That means...

849
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:54,030
A part of his voice
is pretty much right out there
for us to hear.

850
00:57:54,030 --> 00:57:56,120
Only it's still masked
by all the other garbage

851
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:58,140
I've gotta take
from the rest of his voice.

852
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:03,050
-(sighs)
-[Bill] Peter Palmer, please.

853
00:58:04,990 --> 00:58:08,170
Can you tell him to call me
as soon as he shows up?
It's his father.

854
00:58:09,170 --> 00:58:11,060
On the money, Moose.

855
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:13,150
You found Franz.

856
00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:15,070
Just outside
lovely Bennington, Illinois.

857
00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:16,110
He lives with his son.

858
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:19,090
(exhales sharply)

859
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:23,930
Be careful, Hewlett.

860
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:27,070
(sighs)

861
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:30,070
(dramatic music playing)

862
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:03,130
(panting)

863
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:19,060
(breathing heavily)
What the fuck do you want?

864
00:59:19,970 --> 00:59:21,110
We're trying to locate
your father.

865
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:23,900
You think my father
needs to see you?

866
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:25,990
I'm afraid he has to.

867
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,090
I hear your boy, Dr. Petey's
climbing the ladder.

868
00:59:32,050 --> 00:59:34,000
You keep it in the family, huh?

869
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:37,140
Miss Detective Hewlett,

870
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:40,190
has the good doctor here
explained the slash and burn
approach to life?

871
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:43,160
-We can get a writ.
-(chuckles)

872
00:59:44,990 --> 00:59:47,950
You see, Petey and I were
accepted to the same med school,

873
00:59:47,950 --> 00:59:49,110
except I had to quit.

874
00:59:49,110 --> 00:59:51,100
Had a foot-the-bill problem
all of a sudden.

875
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:52,990
Unemployment in the family.

876
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:56,110
We can still get a writ.

877
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,160
You wanna talk to my father?

878
01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:05,070
Come on.

879
01:00:05,070 --> 01:00:07,050
(dog barking in distance)

880
01:00:17,970 --> 01:00:19,070
(door closes)

881
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:22,030
[Mort Jr.] Dad, somebody wants
to talk to you.

882
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:33,190
-Mort?
-(gasps)

883
01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:39,960
One, two, three,

884
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:43,130
four, five.

885
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:49,970
One, two, three,

886
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:52,940
four, five.

887
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:02,090
You could've spared us this.

888
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:04,910
What the fuck have you ever
spared him, huh?

889
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:07,060
Besides, he's far enough along,
he doesn't care.

890
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:08,150
(murmuring) One, two three...

891
01:01:08,150 --> 01:01:09,920
He's not confused about

892
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,110
what he thinks
he remembers anymore.

893
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:14,140
-Kinda makes him
a bad suspect, huh?
-One, two, three, four, five...

894
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:16,050
So get the fuck out of here,
Dr. Palmer,

895
01:01:16,050 --> 01:01:17,920
before I hit you
with the lawsuit from hell.

896
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,030
One, two, three, four, five.
One, two, three, four, five.

897
01:01:20,030 --> 01:01:21,090
One, two, three, four, five.

898
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:23,950
-[Franz] One, two, three...
-How is your mother?

899
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:25,910
What the fuck are you?

900
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:28,110
-Hey! Hey! Hey!
-...three, four, five!

901
01:01:28,110 --> 01:01:30,130
-Hey! Hey!
-You want to take
another shot at her?

902
01:01:30,130 --> 01:01:32,020
She's not here!

903
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:35,030
She couldn't take it anymore.
You're a fucking cancer!

904
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:36,180
(speaking gibberish)

905
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:38,190
-You're a fucking cancer.
-One, four, three, four...

906
01:01:38,190 --> 01:01:39,930
(panting)

907
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:41,150
(Mort Jr. sobbing)
You fucking cancer.

908
01:01:44,050 --> 01:01:45,160
Why'd you have to say that?

909
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:47,000
[Mort Jr.] You fucking cancer.

910
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:07,900
It's exactly what he wanted.

911
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:10,000
He wanted you to come there,
so you'd see that.

912
01:02:11,970 --> 01:02:12,990
(lighter clanks)

913
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:25,040
We're wrong
ruling out a copycat.

914
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:27,080
You said he was escalating.

915
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,980
He's not escalating

916
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:31,000
when he keeps his victim alive,

917
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,190
when he leaves the body,
when he leaves his voice
on tape,

918
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:36,050
and purposefully sends you
on a wild goose chase.

919
01:02:36,050 --> 01:02:38,000
That's a different MO.

920
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:41,050
And I think it's an insider.

921
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,190
I was in love with her.

922
01:02:59,190 --> 01:03:01,040
Isn't that amazing?

923
01:03:01,930 --> 01:03:03,100
Not so amazing.

924
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:07,090
We were out of control.

925
01:03:09,110 --> 01:03:11,040
Tried to make it work.

926
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:16,910
And then one day she just
packed her bags and left.

927
01:03:19,090 --> 01:03:20,940
I never saw her again.

928
01:03:23,110 --> 01:03:27,050
Kim and I separated and we,
eventually, we got a divorce.

929
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,090
Then I quit and started writing.

930
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:36,050
And in the process of it all...

931
01:03:37,990 --> 01:03:39,990
I lost my son, too.

932
01:03:43,130 --> 01:03:44,970
There's a difference.

933
01:03:48,050 --> 01:03:49,950
You can get yours back.

934
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:54,120
(scoffs)

935
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:15,990
-Joey!
-Joey!

936
01:04:15,990 --> 01:04:20,080
-Joey! Joey!
-Joey! Joey! Joey!

937
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:22,040
-[Leslie] Okay, guys.
-[kids] Joey!

938
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:24,130
-(Joey barking)
-(knocking on door)

939
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:28,030
-[Leslie] Joey, hello!
What's up?
-[Kim] Hi, Joey.

940
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:30,900
-[Mark] Hey, Joey.
-[Leslie] Everybody, take your
covers off, guys.

941
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:34,020
Joey, what is this?
You wanna go out?

942
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:36,030
(barking)

943
01:04:36,930 --> 01:04:38,130
Joey, what...

944
01:04:38,130 --> 01:04:40,010
(Joey growling)

945
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:53,030
Oh, my God.

946
01:04:54,950 --> 01:04:56,090
(gasps)

947
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:15,040
Kids, don't run.

948
01:05:19,170 --> 01:05:20,990
Leslie?

949
01:05:22,050 --> 01:05:24,190
Mommy, could I have some juice?

950
01:05:25,070 --> 01:05:26,940
Not now, honey.

951
01:05:29,070 --> 01:05:30,180
We've been robbed.

952
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:33,940
We better call the police.

953
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:39,070
(indistinct chatter
on police radio)

954
01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:41,050
-[Bill] How about this color?
-[Sharon] Dusted there...

955
01:05:41,050 --> 01:05:42,950
-[man] Thanks.
-[Sharon] Upstairs.

956
01:05:42,950 --> 01:05:44,180
I can't find Peter.

957
01:05:44,180 --> 01:05:47,100
I called his office, the gym,
all the usual places.

958
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:50,000
Yeah, I know,
I called them, too.

959
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,160
Daddy was gonna read me
this book tonight.

960
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:53,970
Can you, grandpa?

961
01:05:53,970 --> 01:05:55,940
Sweetie, why don't I read it
for you upstairs?

962
01:05:55,940 --> 01:05:58,000
-Maybe another time.
-You want me to take your book?

963
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:03,000
Is there anything missing?

964
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,090
Um, no. Nothing.

965
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:09,080
[Sharon] Maybe this
isn't a robbery.

966
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:11,010
Maybe Peter just lost it.

967
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:15,980
Okay, you can start cleaning up.
We're about done here.

968
01:06:16,970 --> 01:06:18,970
(dramatic music playing)

969
01:06:57,090 --> 01:06:59,070
You know he fits the category.

970
01:07:00,190 --> 01:07:02,180
What are you talking about?

971
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:04,010
Peter.

972
01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:06,080
He's an insider.

973
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:08,990
We said it had to be an insider.

974
01:07:08,990 --> 01:07:10,970
-You got to be kidding.
-Think about it.

975
01:07:10,970 --> 01:07:12,170
You're talking about my son.

976
01:07:12,170 --> 01:07:14,190
[Sharon] I'm talking
about a motive.

977
01:07:16,910 --> 01:07:18,920
(music continues)

978
01:07:35,090 --> 01:07:36,990
It's his copy.

979
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:49,170
I've gotta take this to Cobb.

980
01:07:49,170 --> 01:07:50,990
It can't be.

981
01:07:53,150 --> 01:07:55,000
I'm sorry.

982
01:07:58,150 --> 01:08:01,000
-[Sharon] Bag, please.
-You're jumping to conclusions.

983
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,150
There's not enough evidence.

984
01:08:02,150 --> 01:08:04,940
There's more
than enough evidence.

985
01:08:04,940 --> 01:08:05,990
I'm getting a warrant.

986
01:08:05,990 --> 01:08:07,120
What are you talking about?
For Peter?

987
01:08:08,090 --> 01:08:10,050
You're getting a warrant
for Peter?

988
01:08:10,050 --> 01:08:12,160
Are you crazy,
you son of a bitch?

989
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:14,020
-You son of a bitch.
-Come on. Stop it right there.

990
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:16,050
He's not here and you people
are making him out

991
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:17,150
to be some kind of a criminal?

992
01:08:17,150 --> 01:08:19,070
I won't let you hurt him, Bill.

993
01:08:19,070 --> 01:08:20,140
You hear me?

994
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:22,920
You cannot let anything
happen to him.

995
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:24,100
Kim. Kim.

996
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:28,160
-Look, nothing's gonna
happen to our son--
-(sobbing)

997
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:39,900
Bill?

998
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:41,100
You can't believe that.

999
01:08:42,090 --> 01:08:43,910
No.

1000
01:08:43,910 --> 01:08:45,930
But he fits the profile.

1001
01:08:45,930 --> 01:08:47,980
He does resent me.
Knows all about me.

1002
01:08:47,980 --> 01:08:49,010
That's a motive.

1003
01:08:49,010 --> 01:08:50,140
He doesn't resent you.

1004
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:51,990
He wants to be like you.

1005
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:56,900
You don't know what it's like
to have a father
you can't please.

1006
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:59,090
He just wants your approval.

1007
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:03,080
(scoffs)

1008
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:07,130
Yeah.

1009
01:09:08,150 --> 01:09:10,110
There's something
I'm not getting.

1010
01:09:10,110 --> 01:09:12,020
What?

1011
01:09:13,930 --> 01:09:15,080
I have to check something.

1012
01:09:16,010 --> 01:09:17,970
I'll be back as soon as I can.

1013
01:09:34,150 --> 01:09:35,970
Perfect match.

1014
01:09:38,950 --> 01:09:42,170
I don't know.
He was here this morning,
but he seemed upset.

1015
01:09:42,170 --> 01:09:43,920
Trent.

1016
01:09:44,130 --> 01:09:45,930
You have a moment?

1017
01:09:45,930 --> 01:09:47,100
What's happening with Peter?

1018
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:48,900
I need your help.

1019
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:51,170
Well, the police,
they're all over his office.

1020
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:56,140
I need to get into the morgue.

1021
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:59,180
(intense music playing)

1022
01:10:09,150 --> 01:10:11,020
Where is he?

1023
01:10:11,150 --> 01:10:13,040
-Where the hell is he?
-Bill?

1024
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:14,180
Bill. Bill.

1025
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:16,130
-Time out. Time out.
-(panting)

1026
01:10:16,990 --> 01:10:18,960
-All right.
-You're with me?

1027
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,960
Now, what are we looking for?

1028
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:21,990
Um...

1029
01:10:22,930 --> 01:10:23,970
-Rocky.
-Rocky?

1030
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:25,080
-Yeah.
-He's right here.

1031
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:33,130
Let's take a look.

1032
01:10:39,150 --> 01:10:41,060
Who did the autopsy?

1033
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:43,110
Well, nobody yet.

1034
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:47,960
Where did these sutures
come from?

1035
01:10:48,170 --> 01:10:50,030
That's how he came in.

1036
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:54,910
Rocky?

1037
01:10:57,150 --> 01:10:59,050
Talk to me, Rocky.

1038
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,920
Tell me what I'm not seeing.

1039
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:14,000
The woman.

1040
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,050
The black woman
that Peter was working on,

1041
01:11:16,050 --> 01:11:17,170
where is she?

1042
01:11:17,170 --> 01:11:19,010
Right here.

1043
01:11:29,970 --> 01:11:32,040
Do you remember the fight
we had over this?

1044
01:11:33,050 --> 01:11:37,020
How he always does his stitches
the same way?

1045
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:38,050
Yeah, sure.

1046
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,050
Look at them.

1047
01:11:43,990 --> 01:11:45,900
And these...

1048
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:48,950
are completely different.

1049
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:54,140
You're right.

1050
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:57,080
(distorted voice
plays on recorder)

1051
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:02,010
How are we doing?

1052
01:12:02,010 --> 01:12:03,150
We are doing...

1053
01:12:04,170 --> 01:12:05,970
He's good.

1054
01:12:05,970 --> 01:12:07,100
He's very good.

1055
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:10,080
He went to
a lot of trouble here.

1056
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:13,950
But nobody ever goes...

1057
01:12:14,990 --> 01:12:16,090
to enough.

1058
01:12:16,090 --> 01:12:18,960
[man] (distorted voice)
...sleeping dogs.

1059
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:22,960
What now, Bill?

1060
01:12:35,140 --> 01:12:37,150
(intense music playing)

1061
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,130
What the hell are you doing?

1062
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:07,010
[Trent] Are you crazy?

1063
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:12,160
-Now.
-What?

1064
01:13:22,010 --> 01:13:24,080
Trent, look.

1065
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:30,100
The stitches on this man
are the same as the stitches
on Rocky.

1066
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:32,160
So who did the work here?

1067
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:34,020
Uh...

1068
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:41,170
Oh, my God.

1069
01:13:41,170 --> 01:13:43,000
Peter.

1070
01:13:50,130 --> 01:13:52,160
[Peter]
I will not suck it up again.

1071
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:53,950
(device buzzing)

1072
01:13:53,950 --> 01:13:55,940
So, uh...

1073
01:13:55,940 --> 01:13:58,900
All right, call me back,
or I'll call you. Bye.

1074
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:00,170
That was Peter's message.

1075
01:14:02,010 --> 01:14:03,090
And this...

1076
01:14:04,010 --> 01:14:05,980
is our filtered friend.

1077
01:14:05,980 --> 01:14:08,950
[man] (distorted voice)
You are going
to see how naive you are.

1078
01:14:08,950 --> 01:14:11,960
Because it's gonna get
much harder to deal with

1079
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:13,080
when it's the girl.

1080
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:18,000
[Peter] I think I really need
to explain something.

1081
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:21,920
Sounds like
they could be similar.

1082
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:24,950
(voices overlap)

1083
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:30,070
(recorder rewinds)

1084
01:14:30,070 --> 01:14:32,140
[man] (distorted voice)
What she's gonna think of you?

1085
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:35,990
What she's gonna think
while I'm working
and she's screaming...

1086
01:14:36,910 --> 01:14:40,010
(voices overlap)

1087
01:14:40,010 --> 01:14:42,970
[Peter] Not on your machine,
I think I really need to...

1088
01:14:42,970 --> 01:14:45,050
Wait a minute.
It's not the same.

1089
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:48,120
Give me that again.

1090
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:50,010
(voices overlap)

1091
01:14:50,010 --> 01:14:51,980
(recorder rewinds)

1092
01:14:53,050 --> 01:14:55,050
(voices overlap)

1093
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,040
[man] You are going to see
how naive you are.

1094
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:13,970
(voices overlap)

1095
01:15:21,070 --> 01:15:22,190
Right there.

1096
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:24,920
Right there.

1097
01:15:25,930 --> 01:15:27,080
Right now.

1098
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:31,020
[man] You'd hate to have her
think that you're a fool.

1099
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:37,190
You'd hate to have her think
that you're a fool.

1100
01:15:37,190 --> 01:15:38,930
I know him.

1101
01:15:38,930 --> 01:15:40,040
[man] What she's gonna think

1102
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:42,140
while I'm working
and she's screaming,

1103
01:15:42,140 --> 01:15:45,120
and she's wondering
where the hell you are.

1104
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:47,980
What's the cop gonna think?

1105
01:15:47,980 --> 01:15:49,990
Holy shit.

1106
01:15:49,990 --> 01:15:52,100
(dramatic music playing)

1107
01:15:55,900 --> 01:15:59,120
"How naive and wrong he was."

1108
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:02,040
That's what I told him

1109
01:16:03,010 --> 01:16:07,900
for making me out to be
some sort of a slow child,

1110
01:16:08,110 --> 01:16:10,960
and fucking Mort and Franz?

1111
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:14,170
I showed him Mort and Franz.

1112
01:16:14,170 --> 01:16:17,040
And now I'm gonna show him
what it feels like

1113
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:19,010
to lose something
that he was proud of,

1114
01:16:19,010 --> 01:16:21,150
something he thought
that he had.

1115
01:16:21,150 --> 01:16:23,000
(Peter groans)

1116
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,920
(panting)

1117
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:27,030
Can you guess what that is,
Peter?

1118
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,180
Can you guess?

1119
01:16:34,970 --> 01:16:36,010
Marshall.

1120
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:38,910
(grunts)

1121
01:16:39,150 --> 01:16:43,070
I'm not cutting you up
and pulling out your parts.

1122
01:16:43,070 --> 01:16:46,140
I'm leaving you
in one dead piece.

1123
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:49,910
I want a herd of uniforms
and I want Palmer.

1124
01:16:49,910 --> 01:16:51,140
Get them
to Marshall Stone's home.

1125
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:53,140
-We don't have a warrant yet.
-Get it.

1126
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:55,000
I'm on my way.

1127
01:16:56,050 --> 01:16:58,070
[Sharon] The whole damn thing's
a setup.

1128
01:16:58,070 --> 01:17:00,020
He grabbed Peter,
ransacked the house,

1129
01:17:00,020 --> 01:17:02,910
so we'd find the book that
he planted in Peter's office.

1130
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:04,130
He wanted us to think
it was Peter.

1131
01:17:04,130 --> 01:17:07,050
He wanted us to look stupid
just like Palmer said.

1132
01:17:07,050 --> 01:17:09,160
We've been led around
by the bloody nose.

1133
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:11,180
I need that warrant
ten minutes ago.

1134
01:17:11,180 --> 01:17:14,120
Don't be a hero, detective.
You'll get it.

1135
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:15,190
Okay.

1136
01:17:15,190 --> 01:17:17,140
(siren wailing)

1137
01:17:17,140 --> 01:17:20,980
To go from a mediocre
forensic pathologist

1138
01:17:20,980 --> 01:17:24,090
to a bad author is one thing,

1139
01:17:24,090 --> 01:17:27,020
but when he had the gall
to write about me,

1140
01:17:27,020 --> 01:17:29,190
fuck with my masterpiece,

1141
01:17:30,170 --> 01:17:33,030
who does he think that he is?

1142
01:17:34,940 --> 01:17:36,980
He deals with fantasy,

1143
01:17:37,940 --> 01:17:40,000
I deal with reality.

1144
01:17:42,970 --> 01:17:45,010
And I'm better at it than he is.

1145
01:17:49,910 --> 01:17:51,910
(intense music playing)

1146
01:17:55,910 --> 01:17:59,930
Listen to this crap.
Listen to this crap.

1147
01:18:00,110 --> 01:18:02,170
"Bone Daddy lived
for the feeling
of the big moment.

1148
01:18:02,170 --> 01:18:05,960
"The feeling of the cut,
the give, the hot splash."

1149
01:18:08,940 --> 01:18:10,980
What does he know
about my feelings?

1150
01:18:12,010 --> 01:18:13,140
And here. Here.

1151
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:17,000
"He could only unloose
the terrible coiled thing

1152
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,920
"inside
of his dime store bullshit."

1153
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:21,950
Dime store bullshit!

1154
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:26,010
"He beheld instead
the mightiest purity..."

1155
01:18:26,010 --> 01:18:28,170
What right does he have?
What right does he have?

1156
01:18:28,170 --> 01:18:30,960
And here. Here.

1157
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:32,960
He saw it all.

1158
01:18:34,030 --> 01:18:35,910
Right through you.

1159
01:18:37,050 --> 01:18:38,130
(groaning)

1160
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:39,930
(sobbing) No...

1161
01:18:39,930 --> 01:18:41,030
(tires screech)

1162
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:48,160
Peter!

1163
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:52,060
Peter?

1164
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:54,000
Peter?

1165
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,960
(sobbing) No!

1166
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:58,010
[Stone] His perfect son,

1167
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:00,980
the golden boy.

1168
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:04,150
For the rest of his life,
he'll have to live
with the nightmare

1169
01:19:04,150 --> 01:19:06,170
that you became Bone Daddy.

1170
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,160
(phone ringing)

1171
01:19:11,130 --> 01:19:12,910
Stone!

1172
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:16,940
(siren wailing)

1173
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:19,930
Come on.

1174
01:19:21,930 --> 01:19:23,020
(glass shatters)

1175
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:25,900
(intense music playing)

1176
01:19:30,910 --> 01:19:31,970
Stone?

1177
01:19:37,130 --> 01:19:38,190
Stone?

1178
01:19:43,940 --> 01:19:45,150
(groaning)

1179
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:27,980
(tires screech)

1180
01:20:44,010 --> 01:20:45,120
[Bill] Peter!

1181
01:20:46,950 --> 01:20:48,070
Peter?

1182
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:50,980
Peter?

1183
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:53,150
(gasps)

1184
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:55,920
Oh, my God!

1185
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:57,940
What did he do to you? Huh?

1186
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:06,040
What did he do?

1187
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:08,090
-(Peter grunting)
-Oh, God.

1188
01:21:12,170 --> 01:21:13,940
[Bill] Peter.

1189
01:21:15,930 --> 01:21:18,180
Do you understand?
Do you understand?

1190
01:21:18,180 --> 01:21:20,910
Peter? Come on, son.

1191
01:21:22,190 --> 01:21:24,140
No, you're losing him, Billy.

1192
01:21:25,950 --> 01:21:28,110
You've forgotten
how phenosiodonal works?

1193
01:21:29,020 --> 01:21:31,970
[Bill] You poisoned him,
you son of a bitch.

1194
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:35,160
[Stone] It would take
about 50 CCs of real help.

1195
01:21:39,990 --> 01:21:41,980
I'm taking him to the hospital.

1196
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:43,170
What about me?

1197
01:21:44,950 --> 01:21:47,100
Hah! You don't exist.

1198
01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:52,110
Are you sure?

1199
01:21:56,010 --> 01:21:58,960
Who are you gonna blame
for the rest of your life?

1200
01:22:00,970 --> 01:22:02,950
Who are you gonna blame

1201
01:22:02,950 --> 01:22:05,170
when you can't stop thinking
about your son?

1202
01:22:06,130 --> 01:22:08,120
(grunting)

1203
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:16,030
Come on, son. Sit up. Up.

1204
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:22,000
Watch out.

1205
01:22:23,930 --> 01:22:25,100
Behind you! No!

1206
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:27,910
(groans)

1207
01:22:31,030 --> 01:22:32,160
Listen to me.

1208
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:34,020
Punctured lung.

1209
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:35,060
(groans)

1210
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:37,950
(groans)

1211
01:22:42,020 --> 01:22:43,190
(groaning)

1212
01:22:47,030 --> 01:22:48,090
(grunts)

1213
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,170
(clattering)

1214
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:57,990
(grunting)

1215
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:08,080
(water hissing)

1216
01:23:36,150 --> 01:23:37,980

1217
01:23:48,910 --> 01:23:50,120

(grunts)

1221
01:24:46,110 --> 01:24:47,920
Don't move.

1222
01:24:51,020 --> 01:24:53,000
Son, come on.

1223
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,960
Come on, there you go.

1224
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:56,070
(grunts)

1225
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:02,140

01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:04,900
(grunts)

1227
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:08,980
(gunshots)

1228
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:23,000
(gun clicking)

1229
01:25:25,150 --> 01:25:26,950
(hissing)

1230
01:25:28,150 --> 01:25:31,060
(eerie music playing)

1231
01:25:56,090 --> 01:25:57,140
Dad.

1232
01:26:05,060 --> 01:26:07,940
(helicopter whirring)

1233
01:26:15,150 --> 01:26:17,090
(mellow music playing)

1234
01:26:54,950 --> 01:26:58,020
(mellow music continues)

1235
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:13,150
(suspenseful music playing)

1236
01:27:48,900 --> 01:27:51,120
(music continues)
