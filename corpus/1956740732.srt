1
00:01:32,179 --> 00:01:33,136
Hi.

2
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,572
John: Hey, how are you?

3
00:01:34,616 --> 00:01:35,747
Alexa:
Good, how are you?

4
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:37,445
Good.
This is my wife, Alexa.

5
00:01:37,488 --> 00:01:40,012
Hi, it's so nice to meet you.

6
00:01:40,056 --> 00:01:41,405
Nice to meet you.

7
00:01:41,449 --> 00:01:43,015
I was just telling John

8
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:44,669
how great he's done
for the company.

9
00:01:44,713 --> 00:01:45,975
And we appreciate it.

10
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,456
A good calculator does help,
but thank you.

11
00:01:48,499 --> 00:01:50,022
What do you do?

12
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:51,459
Well, John and I have twins.

13
00:01:52,286 --> 00:01:55,245
My son is the star
of the football team.

14
00:02:06,648 --> 00:02:09,172
My daughter is valedictorian.

15
00:02:10,478 --> 00:02:12,306
That's correct!
We have a winner!

16
00:02:18,007 --> 00:02:19,965
And John, well,

17
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:22,054
clearly John is doing great.

18
00:02:22,838 --> 00:02:24,448
You're a stay-at-home mom.

19
00:02:24,492 --> 00:02:26,189
I always wanted to do that.

20
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:28,191
Work just got in the way.

21
00:02:28,235 --> 00:02:30,193
I guess you can't do both.

22
00:02:33,022 --> 00:02:34,154
John: Let's eat, huh?

23
00:02:35,677 --> 00:02:36,678
You hungry?

24
00:02:36,721 --> 00:02:38,245
-Mm-hmm.
-John: Good.

25
00:02:47,863 --> 00:02:49,473
-Ravyn: Beau!
-Beau: Ravyn!

26
00:02:49,517 --> 00:02:50,605
Ravyn: Cut it out.

27
00:02:54,043 --> 00:02:55,087
Give it.

28
00:02:58,047 --> 00:02:59,396
John: Both teams
struggle for the hat.

29
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,832
Ravyn's got it.

30
00:03:00,876 --> 00:03:02,225
Beau's going for it but wait!

31
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:04,401
Dad's in the middle
for the sack.

32
00:03:05,881 --> 00:03:07,012
What's on your mind?

33
00:03:07,056 --> 00:03:08,013
Football!

34
00:03:08,057 --> 00:03:09,276
Same as yesterday.

35
00:03:13,932 --> 00:03:15,586
Dear lord, bless
our day today.

36
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,197
Be with Beau for his game.

37
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,981
And be with ravyn for
her ap Latin class.

38
00:03:19,547 --> 00:03:21,418
Most of all be sure you
give my amazing wife

39
00:03:21,462 --> 00:03:23,072
some quality time today.

40
00:03:23,115 --> 00:03:24,465
-Amen.
-Amen.

41
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:26,510
See you at the game!

42
00:03:26,554 --> 00:03:27,729
-See you.
-Thanks, dad.

43
00:03:33,082 --> 00:03:34,388
John: How are
you this morning?

44
00:03:35,258 --> 00:03:36,564
What do you think?

45
00:03:36,607 --> 00:03:38,218
This pillow or this one?

46
00:03:39,175 --> 00:03:40,220
The green one.

47
00:03:41,786 --> 00:03:45,094
So, I've got something for you.

48
00:03:48,576 --> 00:03:50,099
I saw you eye this at the store.

49
00:03:51,753 --> 00:03:53,755
-Thank you!
-Can I put it on?

50
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:55,626
Yes.

51
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:23,480
Hello, may I help you?

52
00:04:23,785 --> 00:04:25,961
Yes, can I exchange this,
for this one?

53
00:04:28,659 --> 00:04:29,791
Perfect.

54
00:04:42,238 --> 00:04:43,283
Hi.

55
00:04:43,326 --> 00:04:44,501
Ravyn, honey, before I forget,

56
00:04:44,545 --> 00:04:46,068
this came for you today.

57
00:04:46,808 --> 00:04:47,939
-Hi, dad.
-Hey.

58
00:04:47,983 --> 00:04:49,506
So glad you could make it.

59
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,160
Mom said you weren't
feeling well.

60
00:04:51,203 --> 00:04:52,335
I haven't missed a game yet.

61
00:05:09,483 --> 00:05:11,049
Mom, I got early acceptance.

62
00:05:11,093 --> 00:05:12,616
I got early acceptance to mit.

63
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,314
-Alexa: Good, good.
-That's great, honey.

64
00:05:14,357 --> 00:05:15,619
Don't throw a party yet.

65
00:05:15,663 --> 00:05:16,881
You have to keep your grades up.

66
00:05:17,665 --> 00:05:19,231
I'm so proud of you.

67
00:05:36,727 --> 00:05:37,772
Oh, wow.

68
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:42,211
You know, grandma's right.

69
00:05:42,516 --> 00:05:45,127
You worked so hard to get
to this point, but now...

70
00:05:45,736 --> 00:05:47,477
Now the pressure
is really on you.

71
00:05:47,521 --> 00:05:50,306
You have to maintain your
gpa to stay valedictorian.

72
00:05:51,873 --> 00:05:52,874
Okay?

73
00:05:58,532 --> 00:05:59,750
Alexa.

74
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,274
Both your kids are about
to go off to college.

75
00:06:03,232 --> 00:06:05,060
I still remember
when you graduated.

76
00:06:05,103 --> 00:06:06,583
It seems like just yesterday.

77
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,412
Pay attention.

78
00:06:09,456 --> 00:06:10,979
Or you're gonna miss it.

79
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,068
I know.

80
00:06:14,635 --> 00:06:15,636
I know.

81
00:06:16,158 --> 00:06:17,681
Alexa, come here!

82
00:06:17,725 --> 00:06:18,682
Alexa: Jezi!

83
00:06:18,726 --> 00:06:19,988
How are you?

84
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,732
Announcer: And that touchdown will make the score--

85
00:06:26,298 --> 00:06:28,257
I mean, how amazing
is Nathan and Beau,

86
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,432
together out there?

87
00:06:29,476 --> 00:06:31,260
I know, I know.

88
00:06:32,435 --> 00:06:34,785
Our boys are gonna take US all
the way to the championship.

89
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:37,397
Mmm, it's about time
this town had one.

90
00:06:38,093 --> 00:06:39,877
Okay, so did you see margo?

91
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:41,009
No.

92
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,315
Yeah, she gained like 10 pounds
since Paul left her.

93
00:06:43,359 --> 00:06:44,882
-What?
-Mm-hmm, it's horrible.

94
00:06:44,926 --> 00:06:46,318
Oh, my goodness, honey!

95
00:06:46,362 --> 00:06:47,929
-Your necklace is gorgeous.
-Shh!

96
00:06:48,495 --> 00:06:49,887
-Hi, John.
-Hey, baby.

97
00:06:49,931 --> 00:06:50,932
John: Hi, guys.

98
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,630
Shh, don't tell John.

99
00:06:53,674 --> 00:06:55,153
I changed the one he
gave me, for this one.

100
00:06:55,197 --> 00:06:56,894
Oh, good choice.

101
00:06:56,938 --> 00:06:59,157
It's stunning and it's
our little secret.

102
00:06:59,201 --> 00:07:01,116
But to be honest, I
don't like this vest.

103
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:02,160
Really?

104
00:07:02,204 --> 00:07:03,510
I don't know what's going on.

105
00:07:03,553 --> 00:07:04,946
It looks like you borrowed
it from your mother.

106
00:07:04,989 --> 00:07:06,121
-Really?
-Just being honest.

107
00:07:06,164 --> 00:07:07,427
-But i-
-i gotta go!

108
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,471
Let's get
coffee this week, honey!

109
00:07:08,515 --> 00:07:09,603
-Bye!
-Okay, bye!

110
00:07:13,781 --> 00:07:15,652
Hey, coming to the party?

111
00:07:15,696 --> 00:07:17,741
I have to go home and
finish my study cards.

112
00:07:17,785 --> 00:07:19,264
Come on, it'll be fun.

113
00:07:19,308 --> 00:07:20,918
You don't drink.

114
00:07:20,962 --> 00:07:22,311
That's why it's fun.

115
00:07:22,354 --> 00:07:23,921
Weirdo.

116
00:07:23,965 --> 00:07:25,357
-Have fun!
-Thanks, see ya.

117
00:07:25,401 --> 00:07:26,402
Bye.

118
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,192
Nice game, Beau.

119
00:07:34,236 --> 00:07:35,672
Beau: Thanks, thanks
it was a long one.

120
00:07:35,716 --> 00:07:37,674
How about some
ice cream, my treat.

121
00:07:38,327 --> 00:07:41,025
Grandma: I'm cold and
you're not feeling real well.

122
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:42,200
Let's go home.

123
00:07:42,244 --> 00:07:43,506
Grandpa: Maybe next time.

124
00:07:44,855 --> 00:07:46,640
John: I'm in,
how about you guys?

125
00:07:46,683 --> 00:07:48,642
-Ravyn: Yeah.
-John: Yeah?

126
00:07:48,685 --> 00:07:50,339
I'd love to, but I
gotta join the team.

127
00:07:50,382 --> 00:07:51,383
What's up Taylors?

128
00:07:51,427 --> 00:07:52,602
John: Hey, Nathan.

129
00:07:52,646 --> 00:07:53,777
What's up guys?

130
00:07:53,821 --> 00:07:54,865
I'll see you guys
at home, alright?

131
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:56,171
John: Alright, be safe!

132
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,522
Ravyn: Thank you.

133
00:08:10,185 --> 00:08:11,186
John: Alexa!

134
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:14,581
You coming?

135
00:08:16,278 --> 00:08:17,540
Beau: You're positive
that their parents

136
00:08:17,584 --> 00:08:19,324
are not gonna be here, right?

137
00:08:19,368 --> 00:08:20,630
I'm serious.

138
00:08:20,674 --> 00:08:22,632
-I'm nervous!
-They are in Europe.

139
00:08:22,676 --> 00:08:23,981
They're not gonna be here.

140
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:24,982
Alright, alright dude.

141
00:08:25,026 --> 00:08:26,070
He has the house to himself.

142
00:08:26,114 --> 00:08:27,332
I trust you, I trust you.

143
00:08:27,376 --> 00:08:28,333
They've got beer
here, don't they?

144
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:30,379
We wouldn't be here, guys,

145
00:08:30,422 --> 00:08:31,772
if there was no beer.

146
00:08:33,121 --> 00:08:34,426
Ladies and gentlemen!

147
00:08:35,123 --> 00:08:36,603
The party has arrived.

148
00:08:45,046 --> 00:08:46,830
-Hey Beau!
-Beau, you are awesome.

149
00:08:46,874 --> 00:08:48,266
You were amazing at the game.

150
00:08:56,492 --> 00:08:57,580
Here you go.

151
00:08:57,624 --> 00:08:58,712
Alexa: Thank you.

152
00:09:07,242 --> 00:09:08,286
John: Oh, sorry.

153
00:09:16,077 --> 00:09:17,078
Hi, mom.

154
00:09:18,732 --> 00:09:19,733
What?

155
00:09:23,258 --> 00:09:24,564
Oh, no.

156
00:09:24,607 --> 00:09:27,001
John: Honey, what's wrong?

157
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:28,742
Ravyn, grab her bag.

158
00:09:28,785 --> 00:09:30,004
Got it.

159
00:09:30,308 --> 00:09:31,745
John: Alexa, what's
going on, what's wrong?

160
00:09:31,788 --> 00:09:32,920
Alexa: Just go.

161
00:09:37,446 --> 00:09:38,882
I don't know where I'm going.

162
00:09:38,926 --> 00:09:41,145
Dad, he's at Saint Mary's.

163
00:09:41,189 --> 00:09:42,712
He had a heart attack.

164
00:09:42,756 --> 00:09:43,931
Call Beau.

165
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,290
Dude, I challenge you.

166
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:56,770
Yeah, what do you
challenge me to?

167
00:09:56,813 --> 00:09:59,163
I challenge you to
an age-old contest.

168
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:03,646
Dude, this guy is
challenging me to a contest!

169
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,169
Who does he think he is, huh?

170
00:10:09,173 --> 00:10:10,653
I can't get through.

171
00:10:19,662 --> 00:10:20,750
Hey, are you coming?

172
00:10:20,794 --> 00:10:21,925
Yes, is Beau there?

173
00:10:23,492 --> 00:10:24,928
He's kinda busy right now.

174
00:10:24,972 --> 00:10:26,451
Tell Beau we're coming.

175
00:10:26,495 --> 00:10:28,366
Okay, hun, we gotta get Beau.

176
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,977
Then we'll go straight
to your dad, okay?

177
00:10:31,326 --> 00:10:33,633
Alexa, honey?

178
00:10:45,557 --> 00:10:46,515
Girl: Cops!

179
00:10:51,694 --> 00:10:53,696
Officer: Sheriff's
office, stop, stop!

180
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,828
Over here.

181
00:10:55,524 --> 00:10:56,612
ID's gentlemen.

182
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:04,533
Turn around.

183
00:11:49,404 --> 00:11:50,492
Mom?

184
00:12:45,025 --> 00:12:46,809
Grandma: Not
like that, ravyn.

185
00:12:46,853 --> 00:12:48,158
Cut it length-wise.

186
00:12:48,202 --> 00:12:50,160
Keep it trim and unison.

187
00:12:50,204 --> 00:12:52,162
Presentation is everything.

188
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:53,642
It's not what's on the plate.

189
00:12:53,685 --> 00:12:55,513
It's how it looks on the plate.

190
00:12:56,123 --> 00:12:59,256
And you know, maybe you should
have had your hair trimmed.

191
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,998
You're beautiful,
if you'd only try.

192
00:13:03,304 --> 00:13:05,175
Can I carry something
into the dining room?

193
00:13:05,219 --> 00:13:06,698
Really wish your
mother would have

194
00:13:06,742 --> 00:13:08,396
had you work more
in the kitchen.

195
00:13:11,355 --> 00:13:13,575
Ravyn, will you help me?

196
00:13:15,055 --> 00:13:16,447
Don't take it personally.

197
00:13:16,491 --> 00:13:17,797
She's going through
a rough time.

198
00:13:19,363 --> 00:13:22,366
It's always better to lift
people up than cut them down.

199
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:26,196
That's a nice photo.

200
00:13:27,197 --> 00:13:28,677
I really miss him.

201
00:13:30,331 --> 00:13:31,549
I know.

202
00:13:33,725 --> 00:13:34,814
I'm sorry.

203
00:13:43,997 --> 00:13:45,868
Alexa, what can I do for you?

204
00:13:45,912 --> 00:13:48,044
Nothing, I have
it under control.

205
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,525
Here, why don't
you let me do this.

206
00:13:50,568 --> 00:13:51,526
No I got it.

207
00:13:51,569 --> 00:13:52,744
-I think--
-i got it!

208
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:56,966
It's okay.

209
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,054
No, it's not okay.

210
00:13:58,098 --> 00:13:59,403
It's all wrong.

211
00:13:59,447 --> 00:14:00,709
It should look different.

212
00:14:08,238 --> 00:14:09,544
It should be different.

213
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,244
Jael: I know.

214
00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:23,993
Oh, no, no, no.

215
00:14:24,037 --> 00:14:26,039
Honey, no, excuse me.

216
00:14:26,082 --> 00:14:28,258
Your mascara's gonna run.

217
00:14:28,302 --> 00:14:30,043
Come here, let me look at you.

218
00:14:30,086 --> 00:14:32,567
Okay, you don't wanna
be seen like this.

219
00:14:34,047 --> 00:14:35,962
What did you say to my friend?

220
00:14:41,445 --> 00:14:43,230
Don't hide your grief.

221
00:14:43,273 --> 00:14:45,580
You should if it makes
your face fall off.

222
00:15:20,615 --> 00:15:23,270
It's my fault we didn't make
it to the hospital in time.

223
00:15:24,532 --> 00:15:26,360
I should've got arrested too.

224
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,275
Why didn't you?

225
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,540
Well, they don't put
their star player in jail.

226
00:15:33,845 --> 00:15:34,890
You're lucky.

227
00:16:01,221 --> 00:16:03,440
-Jael: Hi.
-Hi, so sorry I'm late.

228
00:16:03,484 --> 00:16:04,615
No problem, how are you?

229
00:16:04,659 --> 00:16:05,660
I'm fine.

230
00:16:05,703 --> 00:16:07,270
Good, do you want some coffee?

231
00:16:07,314 --> 00:16:08,358
-Please.
-Okay.

232
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:25,985
Hi.

233
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:27,029
Jessica: How are you?

234
00:16:27,073 --> 00:16:28,204
Fine.

235
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:33,209
I'm so sorry for your loss.

236
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:34,732
Alexa: Thank you.

237
00:16:37,518 --> 00:16:38,736
Jael: There you go.

238
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,999
-Alexa: Thank you.
-Jael: Sure.

239
00:16:41,913 --> 00:16:46,222
I know we all loved, loved,
loved our last study.

240
00:16:46,266 --> 00:16:50,618
And I am so excited to
introduce our newest project.

241
00:16:52,185 --> 00:16:55,144
This time we get to be artists.

242
00:16:56,276 --> 00:16:57,886
I'm a terrible drawer.

243
00:16:57,929 --> 00:16:59,322
Me too, I haven't colored
since the second grade,

244
00:16:59,366 --> 00:17:01,150
when my art teacher
told me I stunk.

245
00:17:01,194 --> 00:17:02,499
-Aww.
-Kelly: Yeah.

246
00:17:03,718 --> 00:17:05,024
Well, how many times in life

247
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:07,026
do we question
what god is doing?

248
00:17:09,245 --> 00:17:10,377
Exactly.

249
00:17:11,378 --> 00:17:13,075
There are many
people in the Bible,

250
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,729
like Elijah,

251
00:17:14,772 --> 00:17:17,036
who couldn't see what
god was doing either.

252
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,169
God's plans for US don't always

253
00:17:20,213 --> 00:17:22,041
look like we think they should.

254
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:25,740
But the good news is,

255
00:17:25,783 --> 00:17:29,744
questioning doesn't mean that
we failed as his followers.

256
00:17:31,137 --> 00:17:32,703
In your life,

257
00:17:32,747 --> 00:17:35,271
who would you say that
you neglect the most?

258
00:17:35,315 --> 00:17:36,925
My husband.

259
00:17:37,143 --> 00:17:40,102
He works so hard and I'm not
always understanding to him.

260
00:17:40,146 --> 00:17:41,756
Kelly: My son's goldfish.

261
00:17:42,974 --> 00:17:44,237
Jessica: That's funny.

262
00:17:44,498 --> 00:17:46,848
I would be willing to
bet, it's probably you.

263
00:17:48,502 --> 00:17:50,243
That's why this is different.

264
00:17:50,286 --> 00:17:52,201
We're gonna get to
learn about ourselves.

265
00:17:52,245 --> 00:17:55,726
And we're gonna see how
god protects and provides

266
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,250
for our emotional health.

267
00:17:58,251 --> 00:18:00,905
So, if you'll turn to page nine,

268
00:18:00,949 --> 00:18:04,344
our first activity
is called who am I.

269
00:18:05,432 --> 00:18:06,911
The directions say,

270
00:18:06,955 --> 00:18:09,088
using colors, images, and words,

271
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:11,090
express how you're
feeling today.

272
00:18:11,786 --> 00:18:12,830
Okay?

273
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,528
Alright.

274
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:38,073
Have any of you
ever felt cursed?

275
00:18:41,816 --> 00:18:43,861
The red in my drawing represents

276
00:18:43,905 --> 00:18:46,081
frustration and anger.

277
00:18:47,082 --> 00:18:48,605
I have struggled my entire life

278
00:18:48,649 --> 00:18:50,999
with not knowing
who my real dad is.

279
00:18:51,042 --> 00:18:53,393
And sometimes, I
wonder where god is.

280
00:18:55,351 --> 00:18:59,268
And my drawing has
blocks on its feet.

281
00:18:59,312 --> 00:19:01,270
Because I feel stuck.

282
00:19:01,314 --> 00:19:02,793
My family is well-off,

283
00:19:02,837 --> 00:19:05,448
and I have everything I
need and nothing I want.

284
00:19:05,492 --> 00:19:09,322
The problem is, I can't
figure out what it is I want.

285
00:19:10,018 --> 00:19:12,629
Well, god sent
Elijah on an adventure,

286
00:19:12,673 --> 00:19:15,023
that would eventually
change him.

287
00:19:15,066 --> 00:19:19,027
And hopefully that's
what this will do for US.

288
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:22,639
Before next week,
you'll want to read

289
00:19:22,683 --> 00:19:25,903
first kings, 17 through 19.

290
00:19:26,556 --> 00:19:27,688
Okay?

291
00:19:28,254 --> 00:19:30,343
-Thanks ladies.
-Ladies: Thank you.

292
00:19:38,873 --> 00:19:40,527
Alexa: Was just
looking at your drawing.

293
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:43,530
That's beautiful.

294
00:19:43,573 --> 00:19:44,879
Alexa: Thank you.

295
00:19:45,532 --> 00:19:46,968
Jael:
I'll call you this week.

296
00:19:47,621 --> 00:19:48,709
Okay?

297
00:19:49,536 --> 00:19:50,885
-Bye, Kelly.
-Kelly: Thank you.

298
00:19:50,928 --> 00:19:52,060
Jael: Good to see you.

299
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:05,029
Coach z: Oh, hello ravyn.

300
00:20:05,073 --> 00:20:07,206
I was just thinking about
you and your family.

301
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:08,337
How you doing?

302
00:20:08,381 --> 00:20:09,556
Fine, thanks.

303
00:20:09,904 --> 00:20:11,340
Actually I just wanna
check my ranking.

304
00:20:11,384 --> 00:20:13,255
Again?

305
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:16,215
Ravyn, we just checked
it two weeks ago.

306
00:20:16,911 --> 00:20:18,260
I thought you might
wanna talk about--

307
00:20:18,304 --> 00:20:20,088
can you just check
it again, please?

308
00:20:22,003 --> 00:20:23,613
Okay, have a seat.

309
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,572
How's your day so far?

310
00:20:26,181 --> 00:20:27,226
Ravyn: Okay.

311
00:20:28,662 --> 00:20:30,359
Alright, well as of today,

312
00:20:30,403 --> 00:20:31,665
you are number two.

313
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:34,102
What?

314
00:20:34,407 --> 00:20:37,540
Coach z: Ravyn, salutatorian
is a wonderful achievement.

315
00:20:37,584 --> 00:20:40,500
You're number two,
out of 220 kids.

316
00:20:41,849 --> 00:20:43,285
Between me and you,

317
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:44,678
Beau's also two.

318
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:48,116
A hundred and two.

319
00:20:50,118 --> 00:20:51,859
But he's number
one on your team.

320
00:21:04,001 --> 00:21:05,133
You okay?

321
00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:09,398
It's just this stupid class
is bringing my gpa down.

322
00:21:09,442 --> 00:21:10,486
It's okay.

323
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:12,401
It's not okay.

324
00:21:12,445 --> 00:21:13,707
I can help you study.

325
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,493
It's not even like I'm ever
gonna use Latin, in my life.

326
00:21:18,015 --> 00:21:20,191
B+ is not the
end of the world.

327
00:21:20,801 --> 00:21:21,976
It would be for me.

328
00:21:22,629 --> 00:21:23,847
I have a b+.

329
00:21:24,457 --> 00:21:26,589
Teacher: Alright
everybody, settle down.

330
00:21:26,633 --> 00:21:28,591
Exams are coming up.

331
00:21:28,635 --> 00:21:32,116
And next class you'll all
get your study guides.

332
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,118
This midterm exam
will be comprehensive

333
00:21:34,162 --> 00:21:36,033
of everything this semester.

334
00:21:36,077 --> 00:21:39,210
It's worth 25 percent
of your final grade.

335
00:21:39,689 --> 00:21:42,301
Nathan: I overheard coach
talking on the phone yesterday.

336
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:43,650
Oh, what about, cliff?

337
00:21:43,693 --> 00:21:45,304
Cliff is an idiot.

338
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:46,827
All the running we do,

339
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,307
you'd think he'd be
able to outrun a cop.

340
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,786
But he's off the team.

341
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,005
What, did he quit?

342
00:21:51,048 --> 00:21:52,354
He didn't wanna
sit on the bench,

343
00:21:52,398 --> 00:21:53,703
but he was a
bench-warmer anyway,

344
00:21:53,747 --> 00:21:55,618
so I don't really get it.

345
00:21:55,662 --> 00:21:57,533
So what'd you hear
coach talking about?

346
00:21:57,577 --> 00:21:59,361
Coach wants to get
some college scouts

347
00:21:59,405 --> 00:22:01,015
out to one of our games.

348
00:22:01,581 --> 00:22:03,234
Really, when?

349
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:04,888
Yeah, I don't know which one.

350
00:22:04,932 --> 00:22:06,673
Well, we gotta
play good out there.

351
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:08,675
Don't mess this up for me.

352
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:12,896
Teacher: Ravyn, could
you come here for a second?

353
00:22:16,726 --> 00:22:19,686
Would you make copies of
the study guide for me?

354
00:23:31,932 --> 00:23:33,412
Beau: That's quite a load.

355
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:34,761
Here, let me help you out.

356
00:24:02,832 --> 00:24:05,618
Beau, move that a
little bit to the left.

357
00:24:06,662 --> 00:24:10,797
No, no, maybe a quarter
of an inch to the right.

358
00:24:15,323 --> 00:24:16,629
Here, try this one.

359
00:24:16,672 --> 00:24:18,108
- Alexa: John?
- John: Yeah?

360
00:24:18,152 --> 00:24:19,327
I can't take this.

361
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:20,633
Okay, alright, alright.

362
00:24:25,551 --> 00:24:29,337
She is making me crazy.

363
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,512
I know.

364
00:24:30,556 --> 00:24:31,774
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

365
00:24:31,818 --> 00:24:33,036
I'm supposed to
move my kids out,

366
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,342
before moving in my mother.

367
00:24:34,385 --> 00:24:36,779
She's taking over my house.

368
00:24:36,823 --> 00:24:38,825
I know, babe, I know.

369
00:24:39,826 --> 00:24:41,784
Look, this is how
she's dealing with it.

370
00:24:41,828 --> 00:24:44,004
It's the only thing
she can control.

371
00:24:49,749 --> 00:24:51,881
We've got to talk
about Beau's drinking.

372
00:24:51,925 --> 00:24:53,448
Wait, what drinking?

373
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:56,973
The other night when we picked
him up, he'd been drinking.

374
00:24:57,017 --> 00:24:58,409
How do you know?

375
00:24:58,453 --> 00:25:00,716
Alexa, trust me,
he smelled like it.

376
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,848
He was drunk.

377
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:05,112
What's there to talk about?

378
00:25:06,592 --> 00:25:08,681
Our responsibility as parents?

379
00:25:09,203 --> 00:25:10,813
Beau's responsibility?

380
00:25:10,857 --> 00:25:12,511
We all signed that
athletic code.

381
00:25:13,947 --> 00:25:15,818
John, look around you.

382
00:25:15,862 --> 00:25:17,428
Look at this mess.

383
00:25:17,472 --> 00:25:19,648
I can't deal with
anything else right now.

384
00:25:19,692 --> 00:25:20,649
I can't.

385
00:25:20,693 --> 00:25:22,999
Organizing those boxes,

386
00:25:23,043 --> 00:25:25,088
is not as important
as your family.

387
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,267
Look, I've been
praying about this.

388
00:25:35,621 --> 00:25:36,752
Hi, honey.

389
00:25:36,796 --> 00:25:37,840
Hi!

390
00:25:37,884 --> 00:25:39,102
I made you a casserole.

391
00:25:39,929 --> 00:25:42,541
I just know how hard can
be in times like these.

392
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:44,194
So I made you my favorite,

393
00:25:44,238 --> 00:25:45,892
cheese and broccoli.

394
00:25:49,722 --> 00:25:51,071
How's it going in there?

395
00:25:53,421 --> 00:25:55,815
Oh, I'm sure it's
just a crazy time.

396
00:25:56,642 --> 00:25:58,252
It sounds like a
lot of commotion.

397
00:25:58,295 --> 00:25:59,688
Are you reorganizing?

398
00:26:00,733 --> 00:26:02,082
Really, how are you?

399
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:03,387
Hi, jezi!

400
00:26:03,431 --> 00:26:05,389
Come in and see our
new arrangement.

401
00:26:05,433 --> 00:26:06,608
I'd love to.

402
00:26:06,652 --> 00:26:09,219
We're not done,
so maybe later.

403
00:26:09,263 --> 00:26:10,917
Oh, I want her opinion.

404
00:26:12,483 --> 00:26:14,311
Thank you for the
casserole, jezi.

405
00:26:14,355 --> 00:26:15,399
Nice chat!

406
00:26:15,443 --> 00:26:16,879
Oh, I'll come back later.

407
00:26:16,923 --> 00:26:18,054
No need.

408
00:26:37,813 --> 00:26:39,119
Grandma: Well, I
think this household

409
00:26:39,162 --> 00:26:40,947
could use some organizing.

410
00:26:43,819 --> 00:26:45,299
If you wanna leave,

411
00:26:45,342 --> 00:26:47,127
and take your statues with you,

412
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:48,955
I'm okay with that.

413
00:26:55,222 --> 00:26:56,310
Excuse me.

414
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:20,116
Who wants to say grace?

415
00:27:24,817 --> 00:27:25,992
You okay?

416
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:27,820
Fine.

417
00:27:33,477 --> 00:27:34,827
Jael: So if you
had a chance to read

418
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:35,958
first kings this week,

419
00:27:36,219 --> 00:27:37,873
then you know that
god protected Elijah

420
00:27:37,917 --> 00:27:39,179
from a lot of people.

421
00:27:40,528 --> 00:27:41,572
In your workbooks,
you'll see that

422
00:27:41,877 --> 00:27:43,662
you have three
concentric circles.

423
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:45,664
The center circle

424
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:48,710
is for your closest
and safest relationships.

425
00:27:48,754 --> 00:27:50,973
The second is for
people who know you,

426
00:27:51,017 --> 00:27:53,672
but not your most
intimate details.

427
00:27:54,368 --> 00:27:56,675
And then the third
is for acquaintances.

428
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,679
The first time I
did this exercise,

429
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:04,421
I had a tenancy to try to
lump everyone into the center.

430
00:28:04,465 --> 00:28:06,510
I wasn't recognizing that

431
00:28:06,554 --> 00:28:08,077
there were a lot of
people in my life

432
00:28:08,121 --> 00:28:10,166
that weren't treating me well.

433
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:11,733
And it had been that
way for so long,

434
00:28:11,777 --> 00:28:13,604
I wasn't really noticing.

435
00:28:13,648 --> 00:28:16,390
So this is a really good
way for US to recognize

436
00:28:16,433 --> 00:28:19,654
who and when to let someone
close to our hearts.

437
00:28:20,786 --> 00:28:22,483
Is anyone in the wrong place?

438
00:28:23,136 --> 00:28:25,704
If so, use an arrow
and move that person

439
00:28:25,747 --> 00:28:28,968
closer to or further
away from your heart.

440
00:28:31,405 --> 00:28:32,928
Is anyone missing?

441
00:28:38,325 --> 00:28:40,109
I think i'm
valuing my friend's opinions

442
00:28:40,153 --> 00:28:41,720
more than my family.

443
00:28:41,763 --> 00:28:43,373
I have a few friends who
don't like my husband

444
00:28:43,417 --> 00:28:45,941
and they keep reinforcing
negatives about him.

445
00:28:45,985 --> 00:28:47,769
I moved them out of
the inner circle,

446
00:28:47,813 --> 00:28:49,292
to the second ring.

447
00:28:49,336 --> 00:28:51,555
I so get you.
The light just went on.

448
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:54,384
I'm realizing that I value
what other moms think of me,

449
00:28:54,428 --> 00:28:56,082
more than what my family thinks.

450
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:57,170
Same here.

451
00:28:59,433 --> 00:29:01,609
Jael: Oh, I almost forgot.

452
00:29:02,915 --> 00:29:05,569
This is a game that goes
along with our study.

453
00:29:05,613 --> 00:29:07,267
It's wonderful.

454
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:10,139
It's really helped my
family to open up and share.

455
00:29:10,183 --> 00:29:11,924
I'd love for you
to all try it out.

456
00:29:11,967 --> 00:29:14,274
Alexa would you like
to take it home first?

457
00:29:15,318 --> 00:29:16,755
Oh, well...

458
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,369
My family doesn't really
have a problem communicating.

459
00:29:22,848 --> 00:29:24,240
-Jessica: Take it!
-It'll be fun.

460
00:29:24,284 --> 00:29:25,633
Jessica: Yeah, it's a game.

461
00:29:25,676 --> 00:29:27,156
It's really something
for everyone.

462
00:29:39,168 --> 00:29:40,474
Beau: Yeah, come on in.

463
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,087
Alexa: Hi.

464
00:29:45,131 --> 00:29:46,393
Hey mom, what's up?

465
00:29:52,225 --> 00:29:53,443
What are you doing?

466
00:29:53,487 --> 00:29:55,141
Oh, I'm just
watching the predators.

467
00:29:57,186 --> 00:29:58,361
Gotta figure out a
way to beat them.

468
00:29:58,405 --> 00:29:59,536
Impressive.

469
00:30:01,016 --> 00:30:03,149
I didn't know how much
preparation went into your game.

470
00:30:04,237 --> 00:30:05,194
Can you pause that?

471
00:30:05,238 --> 00:30:06,630
Yeah, what's up?

472
00:30:06,674 --> 00:30:08,807
Well, they were
going in for the kick,

473
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,939
but they made a touchdown.

474
00:30:10,983 --> 00:30:12,462
Oh, yeah, I know.

475
00:30:12,506 --> 00:30:13,942
Okay, so this is called
a two point conversion.

476
00:30:13,986 --> 00:30:15,204
Instead of lining
up for the kicker,

477
00:30:15,509 --> 00:30:17,293
you've got the center
and the quarterback.

478
00:30:17,337 --> 00:30:19,513
He gets the snap, runs
back to the back field,

479
00:30:19,556 --> 00:30:21,732
cuts off to the right
field, throws the football,

480
00:30:21,776 --> 00:30:23,647
is waiting for the
receiver in the end zone.

481
00:30:23,691 --> 00:30:25,649
Boom, two points instead of one.

482
00:30:25,693 --> 00:30:26,868
It's genius.

483
00:30:28,914 --> 00:30:30,524
You are so smart.

484
00:30:39,576 --> 00:30:41,013
Grandpa gave you this.

485
00:30:43,537 --> 00:30:44,755
Yeah, he did.

486
00:30:45,756 --> 00:30:48,847
Everything I know, I
learned from that guy.

487
00:30:54,635 --> 00:30:56,028
-Alrighty...
-Okay.

488
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,768
I'll see you at dinner.

489
00:30:57,812 --> 00:30:59,727
Okay, see ya.

490
00:31:21,792 --> 00:31:23,751
Now is not really a good time.

491
00:31:26,406 --> 00:31:28,060
It's never gonna
be a good time.

492
00:31:33,848 --> 00:31:36,198
I can't believe we
have paper napkins.

493
00:31:36,242 --> 00:31:38,984
What happened to the cloth
ones I gave you for Christmas?

494
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,249
I have a sharing game.

495
00:31:43,858 --> 00:31:45,381
Would anyone like to play?

496
00:31:45,425 --> 00:31:46,643
That's a good idea.

497
00:31:47,775 --> 00:31:50,256
I think I'm a little
old to play games.

498
00:31:51,344 --> 00:31:52,911
I love puzzle games.

499
00:31:52,954 --> 00:31:57,263
That's because you are
a smart, studious kid.

500
00:31:58,264 --> 00:32:01,310
Yeah, she does
have all the answers.

501
00:32:02,964 --> 00:32:04,444
Grandma: I love games.

502
00:32:04,487 --> 00:32:06,228
Alexa, do you remember
when we played games,

503
00:32:06,272 --> 00:32:08,796
when you were younger
and I always won?

504
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:10,885
Well, I'm going to win today.

505
00:32:11,668 --> 00:32:13,322
I don't think anybody wins.

506
00:32:14,193 --> 00:32:15,324
I'll start.

507
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:21,678
What is the hardest thing that
has happened in your life?

508
00:32:29,817 --> 00:32:33,038
We have to answer
the card we were dealt.

509
00:32:33,734 --> 00:32:35,040
I don't like the question.

510
00:32:37,564 --> 00:32:39,000
You know I don't
think I need a card,

511
00:32:39,044 --> 00:32:40,349
to tell me that
I'm feeling anxious

512
00:32:40,393 --> 00:32:42,177
about winning the championship.

513
00:32:42,221 --> 00:32:43,787
Nonsense, Beau.

514
00:32:43,831 --> 00:32:46,138
You're a winner, you're
a winner just like me.

515
00:32:47,008 --> 00:32:49,141
Beau, about the game.

516
00:32:49,184 --> 00:32:50,969
Whoever has the
card, has the floor.

517
00:32:51,012 --> 00:32:52,013
Okay.

518
00:32:53,406 --> 00:32:54,624
Like I was saying...

519
00:32:54,668 --> 00:32:55,974
-One second.
-Beau, wait.

520
00:32:56,017 --> 00:32:57,845
-Nate's here, I gotta go.
-Beau!

521
00:32:58,498 --> 00:33:00,195
We're not done talking...

522
00:33:26,178 --> 00:33:27,614
We've gotta deal with this.

523
00:33:34,795 --> 00:33:37,537
Remember when our
biggest parenting dilemma

524
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:40,540
was how much Saturday morning
cartoons he could watch?

525
00:33:46,111 --> 00:33:47,764
John, he's a good kid.

526
00:33:49,288 --> 00:33:50,767
I can't turn him in.

527
00:33:51,594 --> 00:33:53,596
There are other football
players at the party.

528
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,730
We have to teach him to
do the right things, now.

529
00:33:57,557 --> 00:34:00,995
I think he dodged a bullet
when he didn't get caught.

530
00:34:01,735 --> 00:34:02,866
Really?

531
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,259
Can't we just leave it alone?

532
00:34:05,217 --> 00:34:06,740
Can we pray about this?

533
00:34:15,966 --> 00:34:16,880
Grandma: Give it to me!

534
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,580
Guys, give it to
me, give it to me!

535
00:34:21,276 --> 00:34:23,104
Beau, do something.

536
00:34:23,148 --> 00:34:24,758
Oh, come on, grandma.

537
00:34:24,801 --> 00:34:27,413
We're football players, we
gotta practice sometime.

538
00:34:29,458 --> 00:34:31,765
Boys: Whoa!

539
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:37,771
Uh-oh.

540
00:34:46,649 --> 00:34:47,781
What?

541
00:34:52,307 --> 00:34:53,526
Can I come in?

542
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:55,615
Mom, I'm busy studying.

543
00:34:55,658 --> 00:34:56,964
What do you need?

544
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:01,969
I just wanted to say hi.

545
00:35:02,012 --> 00:35:03,144
Why?

546
00:35:06,321 --> 00:35:08,149
Can't a mom say
hi to her daughter?

547
00:35:08,193 --> 00:35:09,455
That would be a first.

548
00:35:18,725 --> 00:35:20,248
Did you know that
your name means

549
00:35:20,292 --> 00:35:21,728
dark-haired wise one?

550
00:35:22,729 --> 00:35:24,165
I hope that's on the test.

551
00:35:24,818 --> 00:35:25,906
What are you studying?

552
00:35:26,907 --> 00:35:30,128
Ap Latin, it's impossible.

553
00:35:30,171 --> 00:35:31,738
Really, even for you?

554
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,176
You're very intelligent,
you're valedictorian.

555
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,832
Mom.

556
00:35:40,181 --> 00:35:43,053
Can you please
just let me study?

557
00:35:45,491 --> 00:35:46,492
Ravyn...

558
00:35:48,668 --> 00:35:50,148
What's going on?

559
00:35:52,846 --> 00:35:54,891
I'm just really stressed out.

560
00:35:54,935 --> 00:35:57,067
What's the sudden
interest in my life?

561
00:35:57,111 --> 00:35:58,460
I am interested.

562
00:35:58,504 --> 00:35:59,983
Really, because
you didn't even

563
00:36:00,027 --> 00:36:02,203
seem to notice me at
grandpa's funeral.

564
00:36:02,247 --> 00:36:04,031
Jael cared more about
me than you did,

565
00:36:04,074 --> 00:36:05,511
and I don't even know her.

566
00:36:12,344 --> 00:36:13,823
Do you want to
talk about it now?

567
00:36:13,867 --> 00:36:16,043
I just don't have
time for anything.

568
00:36:46,987 --> 00:36:49,119
Jessica: I never thought
of god as the refresher.

569
00:36:49,163 --> 00:36:50,730
That's what I mean.

570
00:36:50,773 --> 00:36:52,906
The refresher, I
really like that.

571
00:36:52,949 --> 00:36:54,429
Jessica: That's what I need.

572
00:36:54,473 --> 00:36:56,257
My in-laws have been
in my house for a week.

573
00:36:56,301 --> 00:36:57,867
I'm exhausted.

574
00:36:57,911 --> 00:37:00,218
I can't handle my
in-laws at sunday dinner,

575
00:37:00,261 --> 00:37:01,567
let alone a week.

576
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:02,916
Yesterday, I
yelled at my husband,

577
00:37:02,959 --> 00:37:04,874
for leaving his
dishes in the sink.

578
00:37:04,918 --> 00:37:08,051
That's nothing, my husband
leaves his socks everywhere.

579
00:37:08,095 --> 00:37:09,575
Under seat cushions.

580
00:37:09,618 --> 00:37:11,533
Why would he leave his
socks under a cushion?

581
00:37:11,577 --> 00:37:13,100
So that you can clean it up.

582
00:37:13,143 --> 00:37:14,362
Jessica: Well,
he had just finished

583
00:37:14,406 --> 00:37:15,885
a 24 hour shift at the hospital.

584
00:37:15,929 --> 00:37:18,236
The point is, I need
to pray for Patience.

585
00:37:18,279 --> 00:37:20,238
Be careful, when
you pray for Patience,

586
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:22,718
god gives you more
opportunity to practice.

587
00:37:22,762 --> 00:37:24,154
That means more dishes.

588
00:37:24,198 --> 00:37:25,373
And socks.

589
00:37:25,417 --> 00:37:26,548
Peace, I meant peace.

590
00:37:27,636 --> 00:37:29,377
So god can refresh me.

591
00:37:29,421 --> 00:37:32,119
Well, then we will
pray for peace for you.

592
00:37:33,207 --> 00:37:34,513
Jessica: What did you write?

593
00:37:35,514 --> 00:37:39,474
I highlighted almighty,
majesty, and father.

594
00:37:39,996 --> 00:37:42,434
That's a very eloquent
way to describe god.

595
00:37:43,348 --> 00:37:44,436
Anything else?

596
00:37:45,959 --> 00:37:48,091
I don't know
what that would be.

597
00:37:48,135 --> 00:37:49,919
Oh, Alexa, I just feel like

598
00:37:49,963 --> 00:37:52,095
you have god in
such a small box.

599
00:37:52,139 --> 00:37:55,664
You're making me feel
like I'm not good enough.

600
00:37:56,448 --> 00:37:58,841
Like my answers
aren't good enough.

601
00:37:59,799 --> 00:38:02,280
Sorry, I'm not
as perfect as you.

602
00:38:02,323 --> 00:38:04,456
Not everybody has all
the answers all the time.

603
00:38:11,463 --> 00:38:14,422
There is no right answer,
it's a personal thing.

604
00:38:14,466 --> 00:38:15,815
Exactly.

605
00:38:15,858 --> 00:38:17,643
Everything's fine, it's fine.

606
00:38:30,177 --> 00:38:32,222
We caught Beau
drinking at a party.

607
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:35,269
He wasn't arrested but

608
00:38:36,183 --> 00:38:38,881
now my husband doesn't think
he should get away with it.

609
00:38:42,102 --> 00:38:43,930
What are people gonna think?

610
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,935
I don't want to
ruin my reputation.

611
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,721
Alexa, how does
Beau feel about this?

612
00:38:53,374 --> 00:38:55,333
He doesn't even know
we're talking about it.

613
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:23,752
Hey, you okay?

614
00:39:27,408 --> 00:39:29,454
We have to do the
right thing about Beau.

615
00:39:33,545 --> 00:39:34,981
Like right now?

616
00:39:36,243 --> 00:39:38,376
Not right now, now but...

617
00:39:38,419 --> 00:39:40,247
I've been thinking.

618
00:39:42,815 --> 00:39:44,077
I agree with you.

619
00:39:55,828 --> 00:39:56,785
John: The student
must refrain

620
00:39:57,917 --> 00:39:58,613
from socially
unacceptable behavior,

621
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,399
that is discrediting in nature
to the ideals, principles,

622
00:40:01,442 --> 00:40:03,139
and standards of the
community and school.

623
00:40:03,183 --> 00:40:04,880
Such activities would
include, but are not limited

624
00:40:04,924 --> 00:40:06,795
to theft, burglary,
assault, battery,

625
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:09,015
vandalism, possession
or use of a weapon,

626
00:40:09,581 --> 00:40:11,060
or being under the influence of,

627
00:40:11,104 --> 00:40:13,019
and or possession of alcohol.

628
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:16,065
I was really hoping
that wasn't in there.

629
00:40:16,109 --> 00:40:18,807
Consequences for violating
the code of conduct

630
00:40:18,851 --> 00:40:20,809
shall result in
immediate suspension

631
00:40:21,767 --> 00:40:23,551
from competitive activities
for the next 25 percent

632
00:40:23,595 --> 00:40:26,380
of the total number of
competitions scheduled.

633
00:40:28,034 --> 00:40:29,905
John, that's
the rest of the season.

634
00:40:29,949 --> 00:40:31,167
Beau: What's the
rest of the season?

635
00:40:31,472 --> 00:40:32,778
Nothing, Beau, don't
ruin your appetite.

636
00:40:32,821 --> 00:40:33,953
Beau: I'm a football player.

637
00:40:33,996 --> 00:40:35,781
That's pretty much impossible.

638
00:40:35,824 --> 00:40:37,043
Yeah, about that.

639
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,482
Do you remember when we

640
00:40:41,526 --> 00:40:42,962
picked you up at the party?

641
00:40:43,615 --> 00:40:45,355
What, the night grandpa died?

642
00:40:46,139 --> 00:40:47,880
The night we
caught you drinking.

643
00:40:48,533 --> 00:40:50,752
Yeah, it was a party,
what's the big deal?

644
00:40:50,796 --> 00:40:52,319
It was going against
the code of conduct.

645
00:40:52,362 --> 00:40:54,016
I think it's a really big deal.

646
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,322
What's a big deal?

647
00:40:55,627 --> 00:40:56,976
Nothing, ravyn, don't
ruin your appetite.

648
00:40:57,019 --> 00:40:58,281
What's the big deal?

649
00:40:58,325 --> 00:40:59,805
-There isn't one.
-Yes there is.

650
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:02,111
Did someone do
something wrong?

651
00:41:02,155 --> 00:41:03,461
-Beau: No.
-Alexa: Yes.

652
00:41:03,504 --> 00:41:04,505
Yes.

653
00:41:06,855 --> 00:41:08,509
I haven't even opened it.

654
00:41:08,553 --> 00:41:09,684
Opened what?

655
00:41:12,557 --> 00:41:13,601
This.

656
00:41:13,645 --> 00:41:15,473
Good, I'm hungry.

657
00:41:15,516 --> 00:41:16,691
Why am I even cooking?

658
00:41:16,735 --> 00:41:17,866
Well, I'm glad this is over.

659
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:19,477
Hey, no, we're not finished.

660
00:41:20,652 --> 00:41:22,001
Your mom and I
believe you have to

661
00:41:22,044 --> 00:41:23,176
honor that code of conduct.

662
00:41:23,829 --> 00:41:25,178
We all signed it.

663
00:41:25,744 --> 00:41:27,615
You have to turn yourself in.

664
00:41:27,659 --> 00:41:29,138
Well, why?

665
00:41:29,182 --> 00:41:31,053
I mean, everybody
drinks all the time.

666
00:41:31,097 --> 00:41:34,753
I know, that's why we've
been struggling with this.

667
00:41:36,581 --> 00:41:38,321
Look, if you believe in god,

668
00:41:38,365 --> 00:41:39,758
then you have to tell the truth.

669
00:41:40,715 --> 00:41:42,369
Well, we've never
done that before.

670
00:41:42,412 --> 00:41:43,588
We do now.

671
00:41:45,851 --> 00:41:46,895
This is stupid.

672
00:41:47,417 --> 00:41:48,549
What?

673
00:41:49,724 --> 00:41:51,204
Do you know what integrity is?

674
00:41:51,247 --> 00:41:53,815
Yes, it's doing
the right thing.

675
00:41:53,859 --> 00:41:55,208
It's not just that.

676
00:41:56,731 --> 00:41:59,212
It's doing the right thing
when nobody's watching you.

677
00:41:59,952 --> 00:42:01,388
God is always watching.

678
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:05,261
I want our family
to have integrity,

679
00:42:05,305 --> 00:42:08,700
where our words and
our actions match up.

680
00:42:12,051 --> 00:42:13,269
You serious?

681
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:50,568
This is so embarrassing.

682
00:42:51,786 --> 00:42:55,311
Being chauffeured
around by my mom.

683
00:42:57,096 --> 00:43:00,273
I can't believe that
you took my car away.

684
00:43:01,666 --> 00:43:04,451
You know, they can't
win without me.

685
00:43:06,627 --> 00:43:08,803
Everyone will hate me.

686
00:43:15,854 --> 00:43:17,464
They'll know it was you,

687
00:43:17,507 --> 00:43:19,509
who made me tell them.

688
00:43:27,517 --> 00:43:29,955
You know what, you
can't make me tell them.

689
00:43:30,782 --> 00:43:32,653
You're absolutely
right, I can't.

690
00:43:32,697 --> 00:43:33,872
I know.

691
00:43:34,786 --> 00:43:36,657
But I can go in
there and tell them.

692
00:43:40,487 --> 00:43:41,619
It's your choice.

693
00:44:18,525 --> 00:44:19,700
Coach z: Hey, Beau.

694
00:44:44,203 --> 00:44:47,641
Cover my roots, my gray
is showing more and more.

695
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:49,687
We just colored it.

696
00:44:50,078 --> 00:44:51,732
It's dry and brittle and i'm
afraid it's gonna fall out.

697
00:44:53,212 --> 00:44:54,996
My son just called me.

698
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,608
Beau Taylor turned himself
in for drinking at a party.

699
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:04,179
Alexa is getting
so self-righteous.

700
00:45:04,223 --> 00:45:07,052
I mean, everybody knows
that teenagers drink.

701
00:45:08,053 --> 00:45:09,881
Do you wanna know what I think?

702
00:45:09,924 --> 00:45:11,883
I think she made him do it.

703
00:45:12,448 --> 00:45:14,407
I would never do that to my son.

704
00:45:15,234 --> 00:45:16,539
I'm sure he drinks, you know.

705
00:45:16,583 --> 00:45:17,845
But as long as he's safe,

706
00:45:17,889 --> 00:45:19,020
and doesn't get
caught by the police,

707
00:45:19,064 --> 00:45:20,718
I'm fine with it.

708
00:45:20,761 --> 00:45:23,372
I'm sorry, I just can't
color your hair, it's so dry.

709
00:45:23,416 --> 00:45:24,591
Just do it!

710
00:45:25,244 --> 00:45:27,028
Who does she think she is?

711
00:45:27,072 --> 00:45:29,204
Without Beau, we can't win
the championship this year.

712
00:45:29,248 --> 00:45:30,858
How could she do this to me?

713
00:45:30,902 --> 00:45:32,773
I thought that
she was my friend.

714
00:45:33,643 --> 00:45:36,298
Obviously, she is not.

715
00:45:46,265 --> 00:45:47,919
Aren't you gonna change?

716
00:45:50,095 --> 00:45:52,184
I don't even get to practice.

717
00:46:12,944 --> 00:46:14,467
Alexa: Beau, Beau?

718
00:46:15,947 --> 00:46:16,948
Beau!

719
00:46:21,822 --> 00:46:23,171
Beau, get back in the car!

720
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:24,694
Leave me alone.

721
00:46:27,872 --> 00:46:28,916
What are you doing?

722
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,135
I'm driving you home.

723
00:46:32,398 --> 00:46:34,008
You're just
embarrassing yourself.

724
00:46:35,227 --> 00:46:36,315
I don't care.

725
00:46:45,977 --> 00:46:47,326
It's okay to be angry.

726
00:46:50,851 --> 00:46:52,331
We can even be angry at god.

727
00:46:53,375 --> 00:46:55,247
Good, because I am.

728
00:47:20,881 --> 00:47:23,275
Oh, honey, this must
be so hard for you.

729
00:47:24,363 --> 00:47:25,451
It is.

730
00:47:29,542 --> 00:47:30,543
You're right.

731
00:47:31,718 --> 00:47:33,372
Alexa, if you would
have parented them,

732
00:47:33,415 --> 00:47:35,591
like I told you when they
were three years old,

733
00:47:35,635 --> 00:47:37,158
you wouldn't be experiencing

734
00:47:37,202 --> 00:47:40,422
these behavioral problems at 17.

735
00:47:44,774 --> 00:47:46,559
What are you
doing to my kitchen?

736
00:47:46,602 --> 00:47:48,082
I'm organizing.

737
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:52,391
Nothing's in the right place
and it's a mess.

738
00:47:55,655 --> 00:47:56,830
Beau's angry.

739
00:47:59,964 --> 00:48:01,661
But it's okay.

740
00:48:02,575 --> 00:48:04,011
I don't blame him.

741
00:48:04,055 --> 00:48:07,058
But it's not an excuse
to treat you poorly.

742
00:48:07,928 --> 00:48:10,322
But you did just ruin
his sports career.

743
00:49:20,653 --> 00:49:21,915
John: Honey?

744
00:49:28,356 --> 00:49:29,705
Come back to bed.

745
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:34,014
I feel like we made
a horrible mistake.

746
00:49:35,015 --> 00:49:36,321
Well, we didn't.

747
00:49:39,237 --> 00:49:40,847
We did the right thing.

748
00:49:41,848 --> 00:49:43,981
I'm glad my father's
not here to see this.

749
00:49:44,024 --> 00:49:45,373
It would have broken his heart.

750
00:49:47,549 --> 00:49:50,944
Your father would
have been proud.

751
00:49:59,083 --> 00:50:01,694
He was the kind of
parent that I wanted to be.

752
00:50:04,175 --> 00:50:06,220
I feel like my heart
is gonna break.

753
00:50:07,439 --> 00:50:08,527
Let it break.

754
00:50:57,576 --> 00:50:59,230
Hey, how you doing?

755
00:51:01,232 --> 00:51:04,061
Well, mom and dad
are mad at me.

756
00:51:04,626 --> 00:51:05,975
The team hates me.

757
00:51:06,019 --> 00:51:08,108
I can't play football
my senior year.

758
00:51:09,109 --> 00:51:11,329
Things are awesome.

759
00:51:13,113 --> 00:51:14,419
Sorry, Beau.

760
00:51:18,118 --> 00:51:19,598
I'm gonna go home and study.

761
00:51:41,707 --> 00:51:43,317
I'm gonna go home too.

762
00:51:44,057 --> 00:51:45,406
What about practice?

763
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:47,800
I'm sure the bench
won't miss me.

764
00:51:48,975 --> 00:51:51,108
So you
wanna walk with me?

765
00:51:51,151 --> 00:51:53,632
Yeah, you're
my only friend now.

766
00:51:55,547 --> 00:51:58,202
Plus, I think we
should talk about you.

767
00:51:58,811 --> 00:52:00,334
I should've known.

768
00:52:02,206 --> 00:52:04,077
Beau: What are you
doing cheating, ravyn?

769
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:05,992
I haven't read it.

770
00:52:06,035 --> 00:52:07,385
Then why do you still have it?

771
00:52:08,908 --> 00:52:11,128
You don't understand
the pressure I'm under.

772
00:52:11,171 --> 00:52:12,825
But it's good to
be under pressure.

773
00:52:12,868 --> 00:52:14,740
It means you're
still in the game.

774
00:52:18,178 --> 00:52:19,658
I haven't done anything wrong.

775
00:52:20,485 --> 00:52:22,008
You should keep it that way.

776
00:52:22,835 --> 00:52:25,054
I don't know how I'm gonna
sit on the bench,

777
00:52:25,098 --> 00:52:26,317
for the rest of the season.

778
00:52:29,407 --> 00:52:30,756
You know what?

779
00:52:30,799 --> 00:52:32,149
You wanna go play some
catch or what, huh?

780
00:52:32,192 --> 00:52:33,150
Let's do it.

781
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:35,152
I see some green.

782
00:53:08,707 --> 00:53:10,056
-Jael: Hi.
-Hi.

783
00:53:12,711 --> 00:53:13,842
Sorry I'm late.

784
00:53:13,886 --> 00:53:15,104
It's okay.

785
00:53:20,109 --> 00:53:22,373
I'm sorry I snapped
at you the other day.

786
00:53:26,072 --> 00:53:28,030
I'm just going through
a lot right now.

787
00:53:28,074 --> 00:53:29,684
And I know that's not an excuse.

788
00:53:29,728 --> 00:53:33,906
But I am really sorry, jael.

789
00:53:36,735 --> 00:53:38,911
I'm not perfect, Alexa.

790
00:53:40,173 --> 00:53:42,001
I am far from perfect.

791
00:53:43,568 --> 00:53:47,398
I just wanted to create a
safe space for women to share.

792
00:53:47,441 --> 00:53:49,574
I know and I love our group.

793
00:53:50,618 --> 00:53:53,273
It's just my life
is falling apart.

794
00:53:53,317 --> 00:53:54,622
And...

795
00:53:57,016 --> 00:53:59,061
I took it out on you, I'm sorry.

796
00:53:59,105 --> 00:54:00,193
I know.

797
00:54:01,325 --> 00:54:04,110
I really admired what
you did with Beau.

798
00:54:05,416 --> 00:54:09,246
That was a very
brave thing to do.

799
00:54:10,595 --> 00:54:12,597
You must be very
proud of your son.

800
00:54:13,511 --> 00:54:14,773
I am.

801
00:54:16,818 --> 00:54:18,037
Thank you.

802
00:54:21,301 --> 00:54:22,563
Are we okay?

803
00:54:22,607 --> 00:54:24,173
Yes, of course.

804
00:54:39,972 --> 00:54:41,756
Set, hut!

805
00:54:43,454 --> 00:54:44,977
He's open, he's
open, he's open!

806
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:46,370
Hit him, hit him, throw it!

807
00:54:50,678 --> 00:54:51,897
Nathan...

808
00:54:52,506 --> 00:54:54,160
The guy in the same
color Jersey...

809
00:55:00,645 --> 00:55:01,950
Why'd you miss
practice yesterday?

810
00:55:01,994 --> 00:55:02,995
You sick?

811
00:55:05,824 --> 00:55:06,999
Nope.

812
00:55:12,091 --> 00:55:14,615
If it happens again,
you're off the team.

813
00:55:14,659 --> 00:55:16,182
It's not my call.

814
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:19,228
Feel like i'm
already off, coach.

815
00:55:20,055 --> 00:55:23,798
No, no you are still
a part of this team.

816
00:55:23,842 --> 00:55:25,322
All the guys on
the team hate me,

817
00:55:25,365 --> 00:55:27,019
for something that
they're all guilty of.

818
00:55:27,759 --> 00:55:29,151
You still have to

819
00:55:29,195 --> 00:55:30,501
take responsibility
for yourself, son.

820
00:55:31,371 --> 00:55:34,896
2 Samuel 12:7 says
"you're the man".

821
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,856
That's what Nathan the
prophet said to David.

822
00:55:37,899 --> 00:55:40,075
David made a lot of bad choices.

823
00:55:40,119 --> 00:55:41,816
And when he got caught,

824
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:44,079
he was accused of being the man.

825
00:55:44,123 --> 00:55:46,386
You got caught, Beau.

826
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:48,083
And there are consequences.

827
00:55:49,041 --> 00:55:52,000
Now you can either let those
consequences define you,

828
00:55:52,044 --> 00:55:54,525
or you can let god define you.

829
00:55:59,617 --> 00:56:01,314
I don't know how
to do that, coach.

830
00:56:01,793 --> 00:56:03,272
Yeah, you do.

831
00:56:03,534 --> 00:56:05,623
Just trust that he'll work
it all out for your good.

832
00:56:06,711 --> 00:56:08,103
Alright, let me ask you this.

833
00:56:08,930 --> 00:56:10,758
When the football's snapped,

834
00:56:10,802 --> 00:56:12,281
what's your job?

835
00:56:13,065 --> 00:56:14,501
Make that catch and score.

836
00:56:14,545 --> 00:56:16,068
There you go.

837
00:56:16,111 --> 00:56:17,765
But, now you don't always
know you're gonna get a pass.

838
00:56:18,244 --> 00:56:20,507
Right, I guess the football's
either there or it isn't.

839
00:56:20,551 --> 00:56:23,292
But if you'd watch the
quarterback, you'd know.

840
00:56:23,336 --> 00:56:24,946
Yeah but, if I'm watching him,

841
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:26,383
I can't find my Mark.

842
00:56:28,167 --> 00:56:30,691
Son, the quarterback
sees the whole field.

843
00:56:30,735 --> 00:56:33,520
He knows where the
defense will intercept it.

844
00:56:33,564 --> 00:56:35,740
Or he knows where the
pass will be complete.

845
00:56:35,783 --> 00:56:37,132
That's his job.

846
00:56:37,959 --> 00:56:40,135
Your job's just to run the play.

847
00:56:43,617 --> 00:56:45,402
You understand what
I'm trying to tell you?

848
00:56:47,186 --> 00:56:49,667
I'm talking about god, son.

849
00:56:50,842 --> 00:56:52,321
Have a little faith in him.

850
00:56:52,365 --> 00:56:54,106
He's been doing
this a long time.

851
00:56:54,585 --> 00:56:56,282
Have a little faith in him.

852
00:56:57,283 --> 00:56:59,720
Jimmy, Jimmy, the game's on
the field not in the stands!

853
00:56:59,764 --> 00:57:01,113
Let's go, get it together!

854
00:57:11,819 --> 00:57:13,342
Alright.

855
00:57:13,386 --> 00:57:16,563
Nice job, Alexa, way to
break up the dream team.

856
00:57:16,607 --> 00:57:18,260
Alexa: It's okay, Nathan!

857
00:57:18,304 --> 00:57:20,741
You're doing great,
just settle down!

858
00:57:20,785 --> 00:57:23,440
Oh, you're just so much better

859
00:57:23,483 --> 00:57:25,137
than the rest of US aren't you?

860
00:57:28,619 --> 00:57:30,272
Come on, boys, we got this.

861
00:57:30,316 --> 00:57:31,491
Come on, Nate, you got this.

862
00:57:31,535 --> 00:57:32,710
Come on, buddy.

863
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,452
You've got this!

864
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,549
Coach z: Well, that's
it, get them together.

865
00:58:23,064 --> 00:58:24,239
Hey, babe.

866
00:58:24,283 --> 00:58:25,632
Sorry I missed dinner.

867
00:58:25,676 --> 00:58:26,894
It's okay.

868
00:58:27,242 --> 00:58:28,896
Work's been crazy with
that merger coming up.

869
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:30,855
I just hate missing the games.

870
00:58:31,377 --> 00:58:32,421
Mmm.

871
00:58:43,781 --> 00:58:44,869
John?

872
00:58:47,611 --> 00:58:48,612
Yeah?

873
00:58:50,918 --> 00:58:51,919
Never mind.

874
01:00:04,035 --> 01:00:05,166
Right?

875
01:01:01,875 --> 01:01:03,094
Good play, bud!

876
01:01:04,051 --> 01:01:05,531
Jezi: We already
have a coach!

877
01:01:05,574 --> 01:01:07,489
Beau should be
out there playing.

878
01:01:07,533 --> 01:01:09,666
Honey, you gotta stop,
these are our friends.

879
01:01:10,841 --> 01:01:12,016
Come on 20.

880
01:01:15,193 --> 01:01:17,238
Trust me on this, it works
every time, every time!

881
01:01:17,282 --> 01:01:18,370
Let's go boys!

882
01:01:18,413 --> 01:01:19,850
Alright, let's go, pick it up!

883
01:01:52,926 --> 01:01:54,623
If you have something to say,

884
01:01:54,667 --> 01:01:55,886
you can say it to my face!

885
01:02:42,454 --> 01:02:44,630
Teacher: Students, as
I previously explained,

886
01:02:44,673 --> 01:02:47,589
this exam will be
weighted as 25 percent

887
01:02:47,633 --> 01:02:49,766
of your final term grade.

888
01:02:49,809 --> 01:02:53,726
So read the questions
thoroughly, take your time.

889
01:02:55,815 --> 01:02:58,949
Okay, everyone grab
your pencils and begin.

890
01:03:19,317 --> 01:03:20,318
Mom?

891
01:03:20,971 --> 01:03:22,668
Walt would want me to go.

892
01:03:36,987 --> 01:03:40,251
Coach z: Last night I
wrote out this big speech,

893
01:03:41,078 --> 01:03:43,428
about what I was
gonna say to you boys.

894
01:03:45,082 --> 01:03:46,953
Then I thought, you know what?

895
01:03:46,997 --> 01:03:49,564
They understand football, you
understand the x's and o's.

896
01:03:49,608 --> 01:03:51,349
What I wanna talk to
you about today is

897
01:03:52,263 --> 01:03:54,134
that I'm proud of each
and every one of you.

898
01:03:54,178 --> 01:03:56,180
Not for what you've
achieved on the field,

899
01:03:56,223 --> 01:03:58,312
but what you have
achieved off the field.

900
01:03:58,356 --> 01:04:01,141
You've become a
family, become a team.

901
01:04:01,185 --> 01:04:03,491
When we first started this,
we were just individuals.

902
01:04:03,535 --> 01:04:05,580
We've learned to
work with each other.

903
01:04:05,624 --> 01:04:06,668
When your brother gets down,

904
01:04:06,712 --> 01:04:08,148
you picked him up.

905
01:04:08,192 --> 01:04:09,671
And I'm really proud of that.

906
01:04:09,715 --> 01:04:11,412
Now this is a big day for US.

907
01:04:11,456 --> 01:04:12,936
A big day for this town.

908
01:04:13,371 --> 01:04:15,590
We haven't had a championship
here in well over six years.

909
01:04:17,027 --> 01:04:18,637
I'd like to win that thing.

910
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:20,900
But if we don't,

911
01:04:20,944 --> 01:04:22,423
I want you to know that I'll be

912
01:04:22,467 --> 01:04:24,556
just as proud of you,
as if you hadn't.

913
01:04:25,209 --> 01:04:26,384
So before you go
out on that field,

914
01:04:26,427 --> 01:04:27,907
I don't want you
to pray for a win.

915
01:04:27,951 --> 01:04:29,996
I want you to pray that
your friends stay safe,

916
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:32,346
that the other team stays safe.

917
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:34,348
And if you play like a family,

918
01:04:34,392 --> 01:04:36,046
like the team you've become,

919
01:04:36,089 --> 01:04:37,612
nobody's gonna stop you.

920
01:04:37,656 --> 01:04:38,787
Are you with me?

921
01:04:40,746 --> 01:04:42,008
Everybody go get dressed out.

922
01:04:42,052 --> 01:04:43,140
See Donnie for
your game jerseys,

923
01:04:43,183 --> 01:04:44,358
and I'll see you
out on the field.

924
01:04:51,757 --> 01:04:53,585
There's something I
gotta tell you, son.

925
01:04:58,459 --> 01:05:00,635
Turns out that the district

926
01:05:00,679 --> 01:05:02,420
doesn't consider a
championship game

927
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:04,074
part of the regular season.

928
01:05:04,117 --> 01:05:06,119
And since you fulfilled
your obligation,

929
01:05:06,163 --> 01:05:07,904
I guess you're gonna need that.

930
01:05:12,691 --> 01:05:13,953
What's this?

931
01:05:13,997 --> 01:05:15,389
It's our new team jerseys.

932
01:05:15,433 --> 01:05:16,869
You're playing tonight, son.

933
01:05:20,090 --> 01:05:21,265
No way.

934
01:05:21,613 --> 01:05:22,788
Oh, alright, alright,
now go get dressed,

935
01:05:24,181 --> 01:05:24,790
cause you'll look silly
playing in your underwear.

936
01:05:38,195 --> 01:05:40,153
Announcer: Welcome
to Carson park.

937
01:05:40,197 --> 01:05:41,763
For the championship
game between

938
01:05:41,807 --> 01:05:44,636
the crush and the predators.

939
01:05:48,161 --> 01:05:49,946
It's going to be
an exciting game.

940
01:06:01,044 --> 01:06:02,306
Mom, mom, it's Beau!

941
01:06:02,349 --> 01:06:03,350
Beau's on the field!

942
01:06:17,756 --> 01:06:19,714
Don't mess this
up for me, man.

943
01:06:34,599 --> 01:06:36,340
Alright, let's go,
everybody hustle up, let's go!

944
01:06:37,167 --> 01:06:38,690
Didn't need Beau to get here.

945
01:06:38,733 --> 01:06:40,257
We certainly don't need him now.

946
01:06:41,606 --> 01:06:43,390
Girl: Coach, get
him out of there!

947
01:06:43,434 --> 01:06:45,305
Yeah, he's ruining it!

948
01:06:45,349 --> 01:06:47,090
Ladies, settle down with that.

949
01:06:48,526 --> 01:06:50,354
Peter, they're right.

950
01:06:50,963 --> 01:06:52,399
He is ruining it.

951
01:06:53,183 --> 01:06:55,707
Dude, you were more
helpful on the bench.

952
01:07:15,683 --> 01:07:16,597
Announcer: And the
extra point is good,

953
01:07:16,641 --> 01:07:17,207
making it 7-0, predators.

954
01:07:18,121 --> 01:07:19,774
Alright men, let's go!

955
01:07:19,818 --> 01:07:21,385
Wake up out there now!

956
01:07:21,428 --> 01:07:22,690
Use your head, think.

957
01:07:22,734 --> 01:07:24,040
Huddle, huddle, huddle!

958
01:07:25,998 --> 01:07:29,262
Alright guys,
Texas stack, 85-58.

959
01:07:29,306 --> 01:07:31,221
I'll be watching
for you deep, okay?

960
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:33,266
Ready, break!

961
01:07:33,919 --> 01:07:35,138
Let's go guys!

962
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:56,550
Announcer: That's
second down for the crush.

963
01:07:56,594 --> 01:07:58,639
And the predators
team in good form.

964
01:08:04,254 --> 01:08:05,516
Announcer: Third down.

965
01:08:09,172 --> 01:08:11,565
The crush has a chance
to get that third down,

966
01:08:11,609 --> 01:08:13,176
they desperately need.

967
01:08:16,048 --> 01:08:17,658
They're not passing the ball.

968
01:08:18,659 --> 01:08:19,791
They will.

969
01:08:21,793 --> 01:08:22,794
They will.

970
01:08:24,448 --> 01:08:25,623
Announcer: So far today,
it's just not crush's ball.

971
01:08:30,454 --> 01:08:31,803
Set, hut!

972
01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:44,990
Girls: Come on!

973
01:08:45,556 --> 01:08:47,166
He can get open
but he can't catch.

974
01:08:47,210 --> 01:08:49,647
I know, this is so unfair.

975
01:08:49,690 --> 01:08:51,475
He really shouldn't
even be playing.

976
01:08:51,518 --> 01:08:53,303
I mean, my son got US here

977
01:08:53,346 --> 01:08:55,827
and he shouldn't have to
share the field with Beau.

978
01:08:55,870 --> 01:08:57,176
Jezi...

979
01:08:58,656 --> 01:08:59,961
You're right.

980
01:09:00,005 --> 01:09:02,964
You're so right,
he did get US here.

981
01:09:03,008 --> 01:09:05,184
You think that you are so

982
01:09:05,228 --> 01:09:07,360
high and mighty,
don't you Alexa?

983
01:09:07,404 --> 01:09:08,622
Well, you know what?

984
01:09:08,666 --> 01:09:10,102
I can tell the truth too.

985
01:09:11,016 --> 01:09:13,453
Honestly, I thought
it was horrible,

986
01:09:13,497 --> 01:09:15,194
the day that you
told me that you

987
01:09:15,238 --> 01:09:18,066
returned John's necklace
for something better.

988
01:09:18,110 --> 01:09:19,633
What about the necklace?

989
01:09:19,677 --> 01:09:21,505
Jezi: Oh, wait,
you didn't tell him?

990
01:09:21,548 --> 01:09:23,071
You know what that makes you?

991
01:09:23,115 --> 01:09:24,638
It makes you a hypocrite.

992
01:09:24,682 --> 01:09:26,336
What's she talking about?

993
01:09:26,379 --> 01:09:28,990
She exchanged your necklace
for something better.

994
01:09:29,034 --> 01:09:31,515
Jezi, no she didn't, okay?

995
01:09:31,558 --> 01:09:33,038
It's right here.

996
01:09:44,049 --> 01:09:45,224
I'm sorry.

997
01:09:47,270 --> 01:09:49,533
I wanted to tell you,
I was embarrassed.

998
01:09:49,576 --> 01:09:51,839
You've been hiding
this the whole time?

999
01:09:51,883 --> 01:09:54,407
See, she's a hypocrite.

1000
01:09:54,451 --> 01:09:57,410
Jezi, hush up.

1001
01:09:58,063 --> 01:09:59,717
Everyone can see your roots.

1002
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:03,111
They're brittle and
frosty and falling out.

1003
01:10:12,251 --> 01:10:13,383
I'm so sorry.

1004
01:10:15,602 --> 01:10:17,691
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

1005
01:10:17,735 --> 01:10:20,172
There was just never
the right time.

1006
01:10:22,609 --> 01:10:24,481
Nothing's good enough for you.

1007
01:10:26,918 --> 01:10:28,920
I don't wanna be
that way anymore.

1008
01:10:30,313 --> 01:10:31,488
I don't.

1009
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:38,408
I'm sorry.

1010
01:10:40,932 --> 01:10:41,976
I know.

1011
01:11:06,218 --> 01:11:08,438
Beau, Beau!

1012
01:11:11,702 --> 01:11:13,269
I know I gotta
settle down out there.

1013
01:11:13,617 --> 01:11:16,750
Listen, I know it wasn't your
choice to turn yourself in.

1014
01:11:16,794 --> 01:11:18,709
But I'm glad it happened.

1015
01:11:19,971 --> 01:11:22,103
I didn't cheat because
of your example.

1016
01:11:22,147 --> 01:11:24,280
You're back in the game.

1017
01:11:24,323 --> 01:11:25,846
Use the pressure to win.

1018
01:11:26,978 --> 01:11:28,196
Alright.

1019
01:11:58,401 --> 01:11:59,837
Way to go, that's it!

1020
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:12,719
Come on, defense!

1021
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:16,332
Here we go, here we go.

1022
01:12:16,375 --> 01:12:18,116
Alright, alright, here we go.

1023
01:12:37,962 --> 01:12:40,138
Yes, alright, nice
play, nice play!

1024
01:12:40,965 --> 01:12:43,620
Announcer: 14-7 predators.

1025
01:12:54,065 --> 01:12:56,372
It's a deep hail Mary pass.

1026
01:12:56,415 --> 01:12:57,851
And it's complete!

1027
01:12:57,895 --> 01:12:59,549
45 yard completion.

1028
01:13:06,469 --> 01:13:09,733
It's up, he's in the
air and it's good!

1029
01:13:09,776 --> 01:13:11,691
Oh, my goodness, it's good!

1030
01:13:11,735 --> 01:13:13,301
That's touchdown crush!

1031
01:13:13,345 --> 01:13:14,781
That's it, that's
how it's done.

1032
01:13:14,825 --> 01:13:16,087
Alright, Nathan, one!

1033
01:13:16,348 --> 01:13:17,741
Let's go! Go on in after him.
Let's go.

1034
01:13:17,784 --> 01:13:19,395
Announcer: 14-13 predators.

1035
01:13:19,438 --> 01:13:20,918
If the crush can make
this extra point,

1036
01:13:21,179 --> 01:13:23,442
it's a tie game and we're
going into overtime.

1037
01:13:27,446 --> 01:13:29,100
Hey, hey.

1038
01:13:29,143 --> 01:13:30,406
-Come here man.
-What's up?

1039
01:13:30,449 --> 01:13:31,929
Beau: You gotta
call a timeout.

1040
01:13:31,972 --> 01:13:33,626
I've got a play that's
gonna help US win this game.

1041
01:13:35,367 --> 01:13:37,413
You gotta have faith in me, bro.

1042
01:13:37,456 --> 01:13:39,023
Alright, alright.

1043
01:13:39,763 --> 01:13:40,981
Timeout!

1044
01:13:41,286 --> 01:13:42,461
What are they doing?
What are they doing?

1045
01:13:42,505 --> 01:13:43,854
Timeout, timeout!

1046
01:13:45,203 --> 01:13:46,639
What is going on out there?

1047
01:13:46,683 --> 01:13:48,075
I've got an idea.

1048
01:13:48,119 --> 01:13:49,599
A play that we can win with.

1049
01:13:49,642 --> 01:13:51,165
We're gonna fake
the extra point,

1050
01:13:51,470 --> 01:13:53,080
and we're gonna go in for
the two point conversion.

1051
01:13:53,124 --> 01:13:55,300
No, no, we're gonna
kick the extra point,

1052
01:13:55,343 --> 01:13:57,084
tie it up, and win
it in overtime.

1053
01:13:57,128 --> 01:13:58,477
Nathan: No, coach.

1054
01:13:59,391 --> 01:14:01,132
Beau's right on this one.

1055
01:14:01,698 --> 01:14:03,961
We can do this,.
This is our time.

1056
01:14:04,527 --> 01:14:05,876
What do you say?

1057
01:14:07,138 --> 01:14:08,444
Your call.

1058
01:14:12,535 --> 01:14:13,666
Alright then.

1059
01:14:13,710 --> 01:14:15,189
Bring me a championship.

1060
01:14:27,245 --> 01:14:28,986
That's a two point conversion.

1061
01:14:31,031 --> 01:14:32,511
What?

1062
01:14:32,555 --> 01:14:34,992
Beau. Look, he's out there.
He's a lineman.

1063
01:14:35,645 --> 01:14:37,995
They're going for a
two point conversion.

1064
01:14:39,039 --> 01:14:40,345
Here we go.

1065
01:15:04,369 --> 01:15:05,501
Hut!

1066
01:16:32,196 --> 01:16:33,806
-You heard it?
-Of course.

1067
01:16:36,635 --> 01:16:38,289
Teacher: John, Alexa!

1068
01:16:39,290 --> 01:16:40,291
Alexa: Hi.

1069
01:16:40,683 --> 01:16:43,903
You guys should be so proud.

1070
01:16:43,947 --> 01:16:45,601
We are, Beau did
awesome, didn't he?

1071
01:16:45,644 --> 01:16:47,080
I meant ravyn.

1072
01:16:47,124 --> 01:16:48,908
There was a lot to
know on that final.

1073
01:16:48,952 --> 01:16:51,911
You earned the highest
grade in the class.

1074
01:16:53,565 --> 01:16:54,610
Sweetie!

1075
01:16:54,653 --> 01:16:56,307
Isn't my ravyn brilliant?

1076
01:16:56,350 --> 01:16:58,788
Thanks, have a great night.

1077
01:17:02,052 --> 01:17:05,098
Hey, Beau. Coach is
buying pizza. You coming?

1078
01:17:05,142 --> 01:17:06,578
Yeah, let's go, I'm starving!

1079
01:17:10,364 --> 01:17:11,931
Nah, maybe next time, guys.

1080
01:17:11,975 --> 01:17:13,150
Boy: All right. That's cool.

1081
01:17:18,677 --> 01:17:19,983
Hi, good morning. How are you?

1082
01:17:20,026 --> 01:17:21,332
Good, how may I help you?

1083
01:17:21,593 --> 01:17:23,639
Good. I was wondering
if I could return this.

1084
01:17:23,682 --> 01:17:24,901
Is that okay?

1085
01:17:24,944 --> 01:17:26,076
I think I can
help you with that.

1086
01:17:26,119 --> 01:17:26,946
Thank you.

1087
01:17:26,990 --> 01:17:27,991
You're welcome.

1088
01:17:37,087 --> 01:17:38,044
Grandma: Thank you.

1089
01:17:38,088 --> 01:17:39,263
Jael: You're welcome.

1090
01:17:39,916 --> 01:17:42,440
This has been an
incredible study.

1091
01:17:43,397 --> 01:17:47,010
The Elijah project was
really hard for me,

1092
01:17:47,053 --> 01:17:49,229
but incredibly rewarding.

1093
01:17:50,404 --> 01:17:52,189
Do any of you have a highlight

1094
01:17:52,232 --> 01:17:54,278
from your journey that
you'd like to share?

1095
01:17:58,369 --> 01:17:59,370
I would.

1096
01:18:00,066 --> 01:18:01,415
Jael: Yes, please.

1097
01:18:03,722 --> 01:18:06,682
I used to love to control
the world around me,

1098
01:18:06,725 --> 01:18:08,074
and the people in it.

1099
01:18:09,554 --> 01:18:11,861
But I never enjoyed anything,

1100
01:18:11,904 --> 01:18:14,602
because there was
always something else

1101
01:18:14,646 --> 01:18:16,387
that needed to be improved.

1102
01:18:16,430 --> 01:18:19,433
There was always
something else to perfect.

1103
01:18:23,220 --> 01:18:26,876
Then I discovered the need
for god, truth teacher.

1104
01:18:27,572 --> 01:18:29,400
And I realized...

1105
01:18:31,794 --> 01:18:33,404
...that life is messy.

1106
01:18:36,755 --> 01:18:39,236
And I don't have to
keep everything so tidy.

1107
01:18:44,502 --> 01:18:46,286
The crazy thing is,

1108
01:18:46,330 --> 01:18:49,725
the thing that I was
the most afraid of,

1109
01:18:49,768 --> 01:18:51,639
ended up making me feel free.

1110
01:18:53,946 --> 01:18:57,428
I'm just trusting in god.

1111
01:18:58,821 --> 01:19:01,084
And just breathing.

1112
01:19:02,607 --> 01:19:04,261
I can see the change.

1113
01:19:18,623 --> 01:19:20,451
I wanna share
something with you.

1114
01:19:21,278 --> 01:19:24,760
You know, in life you
can have all the answers,

1115
01:19:24,803 --> 01:19:26,762
and not really know the problem.

1116
01:19:42,299 --> 01:19:47,043
I thought each milestone,
accomplishment,

1117
01:19:48,305 --> 01:19:51,221
like getting married,
having you,

1118
01:19:51,874 --> 01:19:53,614
would fill me up.

1119
01:19:53,658 --> 01:19:58,489
I'm learning that god created
me just to be his child.

1120
01:19:58,532 --> 01:20:00,491
And that is enough.

1121
01:20:02,362 --> 01:20:07,628
I wish-- I wish someone would
have shared that with me,

1122
01:20:07,672 --> 01:20:09,195
when I was your age.

1123
01:20:47,712 --> 01:20:50,236
Dear god, this has
been a tough year on US.

1124
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:53,196
Thank you for working all
things together for our good.

1125
01:20:53,239 --> 01:20:54,980
And we continue to trust in you.

1126
01:20:55,024 --> 01:20:56,982
In Jesus' name, amen.

1127
01:20:57,026 --> 01:20:58,157
All: Amen.

1128
01:20:58,201 --> 01:20:59,376
Let's eat!
